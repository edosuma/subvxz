00:13.680 --> 00:16.911
You didn'tjust betray me,
you betrayed your country.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.752
I swear to you, I didn't know.

00:18.840 --> 00:20.831
The Russians know about the component,

00:20.920 --> 00:24.196
and they're threatening military action
if we don't get it back.

00:24.280 --> 00:26.475
You're gonna go back to your boyfriend,

00:26.560 --> 00:29.279
make him believe
that we have the component back.

00:29.720 --> 00:34.032
When you go back to Mr Bishop, you will find
a way to excuse yourself from the room,

00:34.120 --> 00:37.351
to allow him time to access your PDA.

00:37.440 --> 00:41.319
If you can feed all this convincingly to Bishop
he will relay it to his Russian contact.

00:41.400 --> 00:44.995
President Suvarov will call off
his threat of military action.

00:45.080 --> 00:48.993
(Miller) I'm always worried
the next crisis is around the corner.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.116
(Bishop) I know how
to take your mind off of it.

00:54.040 --> 00:56.156
Head east 153 metres.

00:56.240 --> 00:59.391
That will put you directly beneath CTU.

00:59.480 --> 01:03.712
This is Nadia. Code Red is confirmed.
Lock this place down.

01:05.120 --> 01:06.758
Everyone on the floor!

01:14.120 --> 01:18.193
- Are you all right?
- Yes. Jack, what do they want with Josh?

01:18.280 --> 01:21.511
- (Jack) What do you mean?
- (Marilyn) They came here to get him.

01:21.600 --> 01:24.876
- I'm not leaving you.
- We're gonna be following you.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.632
Just go. Keep going.

01:26.720 --> 01:29.837
- Put your weapon down on the ground now!
- I'm putting it down.

01:30.640 --> 01:33.154
- The boy's escaped.
- Get the boy back.

01:33.240 --> 01:35.231
I don't care what you have to do!

01:35.320 --> 01:38.357
I'm going to give you ten seconds.

01:38.440 --> 01:42.433
If you don't show yourself by the time
I've finished counting, she dies.

01:42.840 --> 01:45.957
The operation was successful.
My men have your grandson.

01:46.680 --> 01:48.750
Call me when I can talk to the boy.

01:48.840 --> 01:50.876
Finished repairing the sub-circuit board?

01:50.960 --> 01:55.192
Almost. I'll return it
when you bring me my grandson.

01:55.720 --> 01:57.756
Who is in command?

02:00.080 --> 02:01.115
I am.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.758
Milo Pressman.

02:02.840 --> 02:05.434
I'm acting director of CTU.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.268
Cheng, I'm sending the boy to you now.

02:36.360 --> 02:38.510
(Marilyn) What?

02:40.160 --> 02:43.072
Get him into the tunnel, now.

02:43.160 --> 02:45.435
Josh! Josh, no! Josh!

02:45.520 --> 02:46.475
(Jack) Marilyn!

02:46.560 --> 02:49.870
- What do you want with him?
- (Jack) Marilyn. Marilyn!

02:49.960 --> 02:52.235
Help, please! Please!

02:52.320 --> 02:54.436
They're taking my child! Please!

02:55.200 --> 02:57.350
Leave her alone.

02:57.440 --> 03:00.876
- He's just a boy. He didn't do anything!
- Shut up!

03:00.960 --> 03:03.269
Wait! Please. Please.

03:03.360 --> 03:07.239
I can help you calm her down.
Please, let me just help you.

03:07.320 --> 03:08.753
(Marilyn sobs)

03:08.840 --> 03:10.990
Get on your feet.

03:11.080 --> 03:14.277
- Keep her quiet.
- Thank you.

03:17.920 --> 03:19.399
Marilyn.

03:19.640 --> 03:21.232
Marilyn.

03:23.240 --> 03:27.199
All of you, listen to me. Pay attention.

03:27.280 --> 03:31.592
We're moving you to a secure room,
then we will leave.

03:31.680 --> 03:35.434
Do what I tell you to do
and no one will be hurt.

03:38.880 --> 03:39.995
Come on.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.717
Come on.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.231
Let's go.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.512
We're moving you in two groups.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.433
- Group one, on your feet.
- (man) Get up.

04:18.519 --> 04:22.433
- What are they doing?
- They got what they want.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.590
Now they wanna stop us from following them.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.278
We're gonna try and get Josh back.
I need you to be at the front of our group.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.112
You need to be at the front.

04:33.520 --> 04:36.159
Group two, on your feet.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.231
(Jack) OK, stand up.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.188
Go.

04:41.280 --> 04:43.111
Nadia.

04:43.200 --> 04:47.990
If they lock us in the holding room, we'll lose
our chance to get that component back.

04:48.080 --> 04:51.959
- So we have to do something now.
- Yeah. But you need to understand,

04:52.040 --> 04:56.670
this is a long shot at best - there's a good
chance we won't make it through this.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.751
I understand.

05:03.560 --> 05:08.509
Stay close to me. As soon as I make
my move, take the first man on the left.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.751
- What are you guys talking about?
- Chloe, keep going.

05:12.360 --> 05:14.874
Morris, stay alert.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.150
(shouts in Chinese)

06:12.000 --> 06:14.355
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.799
Teams B and C, are the hostages secure?

06:17.880 --> 06:21.555
(man over radio) Copy. All hostages secure.

06:23.320 --> 06:26.278
Cheng's men attacked us.
They were after my nephew.

06:26.360 --> 06:30.672
It has something to do with the component -
otherwise, why would they take the risk?

06:30.760 --> 06:33.149
I need a tactical setup and comm,
I'm ready to go.

06:33.240 --> 06:35.151
But you're still under arrest.

06:35.240 --> 06:39.597
I know the schematics of this building
better than anyone. I can find them.

06:39.680 --> 06:42.717
- OK. I'll release you, but Doyle's in command.
- Fine.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.712
- Get him whatever he needs.
- (agent) Yes, ma'am.

06:45.800 --> 06:48.837
How many casualties did you sustain?

06:48.920 --> 06:51.878
One. Milo Pressman.

06:54.560 --> 06:58.473
- Are you OK?
- No.

07:00.400 --> 07:04.279
- I'm set. We need to go.
- Use my cell until comm's up.

07:04.360 --> 07:06.237
You did great.

07:06.320 --> 07:09.039
(Doyle) We're on the move. Let's go.

07:16.840 --> 07:19.035
That was really brave.

07:20.280 --> 07:22.635
We need to restore comm and satellite.

07:22.720 --> 07:26.190
There may be more server capacity
in data storage.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.918
Try it.

08:37.480 --> 08:39.471
Keep going.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.951
- Climb up.
- All right.

08:53.920 --> 08:56.753
- Hello, Josh.
- Who are you?

08:56.840 --> 08:59.877
- Start loading. We're moving out.
- What do you want?

08:59.960 --> 09:01.951
(speaks Chinese)

09:03.600 --> 09:07.513
- (Phillip) What took you so long?
- I have the boy with me.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.271
Put him on the phone.

09:11.520 --> 09:14.398
Your grandfather wants to speak with you.

09:14.480 --> 09:17.313
- My grandfather?
- Yes.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.391
Take the phone.

09:24.160 --> 09:25.957
Grandpa?

09:26.760 --> 09:28.990
Hello, Joshua.

09:29.080 --> 09:32.277
Look, I'm sorry -
I know you've been through a lot.

09:32.360 --> 09:36.876
"I'm sorry"? A few hours ago you pointed
a gun at my head and said you'd kill me.

09:36.960 --> 09:40.475
- I never would have hurt you.
- I heard you say it!

09:40.560 --> 09:45.350
I had to make it sound convincing, to you
and to Jack, or I wouldn't have gotten away.

09:46.440 --> 09:48.112
But I wouldn't hurt you.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.838
Not for anything.

09:49.920 --> 09:53.356
- This way.
- What do you want from me?

09:53.880 --> 09:56.713
- To protect you.
- From what?

09:57.760 --> 09:59.876
From your father's mistakes.

09:59.960 --> 10:04.670
If you stay here, they'll never let you
forget what your father did.

10:04.760 --> 10:10.756
I'm taking you away from this ungrateful
country - someplace we can both start over.

10:10.840 --> 10:13.832
- Where?
- China.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.835
Within a decade, they will have
surpassed this country in every possible way.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.592
And we can be part of it.

10:21.680 --> 10:26.800
I am going to give you the future
I promised you when you were born.

10:26.880 --> 10:29.269
I don't know what you're talking about.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.669
No... I didn't think you would.

10:31.760 --> 10:35.673
But you will.
I'll explain everything when I see you.

10:35.760 --> 10:39.719
Right now, all I need
is for you to keep an open mind.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.074
Let's go.

10:50.560 --> 10:53.074
Wait. I don't wanna be with my grandpa.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.949
- I'm afraid of him.
- He's a visionary.

10:56.040 --> 10:58.600
You should be grateful for the opportunity.

10:58.680 --> 11:01.319
I don't wanna be with him, though!

11:01.400 --> 11:03.630
(shouts order in Chinese)

11:17.520 --> 11:19.556
(shouting in Chinese)

11:23.800 --> 11:25.552
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

11:37.760 --> 11:42.550
Cheng's using the boy as a shield.
Hold your fire. Hold your fire!

11:44.320 --> 11:46.470
Move! Move!

11:48.840 --> 11:51.752
I've got two hostiles at the SUV.
Cover me now.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.511
(speaks Chinese)

12:19.560 --> 12:21.551
Go, go, go, go, go!

12:41.720 --> 12:44.473
I got one hostile down.
I'm moving towards the roof.

12:44.560 --> 12:47.233
(Doyle over radio) Copy that, Jack.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.153
Go, go. Go.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.991
(speaks Chinese)

13:05.920 --> 13:07.797
Josh!

13:23.440 --> 13:25.237
Cheng, it's over!

13:25.640 --> 13:28.632
Put your weapon down. Now!

13:29.480 --> 13:31.232
Put it down!

13:41.000 --> 13:42.752
Where is the boy?

13:44.160 --> 13:47.550
Tell me where the boy is and I won't kill you.

13:49.160 --> 13:51.116
- Help!
- Josh!

13:52.720 --> 13:55.393
- Help!
- Josh?

13:55.480 --> 13:57.914
Help!

13:58.360 --> 14:00.590
(Jack) Hold on.

14:08.280 --> 14:11.078
Josh... you need to grab my arm.

14:14.240 --> 14:17.118
Do it now. Now!

14:17.520 --> 14:19.795
Now!

14:26.320 --> 14:28.675
You OK?

14:28.760 --> 14:30.591
Mike, I'm on the roof.

14:30.680 --> 14:33.877
I lost Cheng, but I've got Josh.
I need to secure him.

14:34.640 --> 14:40.237
On our way up now. We're setting up
a perimeter around the building.

14:51.440 --> 14:54.796
Josh, the man that had you,
his name is Cheng.

14:54.880 --> 14:57.758
Did he explain why he tried to take you?

14:57.840 --> 15:01.116
No, but he made me
talk on the phone with Grandpa.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.191
- He did?
- Yeah.

15:03.280 --> 15:06.352
- You talked to your grandfather?
- Yeah.

15:06.440 --> 15:09.398
- What'd he say?
- He said that he loved me,

15:09.480 --> 15:12.677
that he wanted to take me to China,
and that I was his legacy.

15:12.760 --> 15:15.274
I think he's out of his mind.

15:15.360 --> 15:19.433
Josh, listen to me. I need your help.

15:19.520 --> 15:25.959
Was there anything you heard that could
help us figure out where your grandfather is?

15:26.040 --> 15:28.429
- No.
- Josh, think.

15:31.240 --> 15:34.869
- I don't know. I'm sorry.
- Josh, hey.

15:34.960 --> 15:37.030
It's all right.

15:37.120 --> 15:40.954
It's all right. Come on,
let's get you back to your mom.

15:41.040 --> 15:44.589
Jack! CTU has a team on the way
to secure the area.

15:44.680 --> 15:47.240
Let them know
my father's still involved in this.

15:47.320 --> 15:50.710
- He's involved with the Chinese? Why?
- I don't know.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.712
I'll ask him when I find him.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.038
(knock on door)

16:09.600 --> 16:12.672
- Sir?
- Come in, Karen.

16:12.760 --> 16:16.548
I just got off the phone with the Pentagon.
The latest intel indicates

16:16.640 --> 16:20.872
the Russians are moving two mechanised
divisions into the Central Asian theatre.

16:20.960 --> 16:26.592
- Within striking distance of our base?
- Yes. Troops are at the highest level of alert.

16:28.680 --> 16:31.319
Tom Lennox was supposed
to be on the call with me.

16:31.400 --> 16:34.312
I couldn't find him
or get him on the telephone.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.597
Is there something that I should know about?

16:37.680 --> 16:42.231
Tom is out in the field,
running a classified operation.

16:42.320 --> 16:45.949
He figured out who the leak was.

16:46.800 --> 16:50.190
- Who?
- Lisa Miller.

16:50.280 --> 16:53.352
Lisa Miller is spying for the Russians?

16:53.440 --> 16:55.032
No.

16:56.080 --> 16:59.959
The man Lisa's romantically involved with is.

17:01.200 --> 17:06.718
For the last year, this man, Mark Bishop, has
been passing Lisa's emails to the Russians -

17:06.800 --> 17:11.555
along with other things
that she told him in confidence.

17:11.640 --> 17:16.191
And that's how the Russians knew
the Chinese had the component?

17:17.160 --> 17:20.709
- Does Lisa know?
- She does now.

17:22.319 --> 17:26.950
Tom sent her back to this man Bishop
with a cover story and falsified emails

17:27.040 --> 17:30.999
that we hope will convince the Russians
that we destroyed the circuit board

17:31.080 --> 17:34.709
before the Chinese could get it
out of the country. With any luck,

17:34.800 --> 17:40.272
Bishop will forward those emails
to the Russians and they'll back off,

17:40.360 --> 17:45.673
and we'll have bought time to actually retrieve
the component from the Chinese.

17:46.920 --> 17:50.037
Well, I hope that works, sir.

17:50.880 --> 17:52.518
Karen?

17:52.600 --> 17:55.478
Sit down.

17:55.560 --> 17:58.199
You're wondering
why you were kept out of the loop.

17:58.280 --> 18:02.159
It had nothing to do with you,
and everything to do with me.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.117
I... I don't understand.

18:06.240 --> 18:11.997
At the same time Lisa was with Bishop,
she and I were...

18:13.800 --> 18:17.076
in a relationship as well.

18:17.160 --> 18:19.230
Needless to say...

18:20.800 --> 18:23.633
I am ashamed.

18:23.720 --> 18:29.272
Well, sir... I think you're being
a little hard on yourself.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.351
You and Lisa were both single.

18:31.440 --> 18:34.750
There was no way you could know
what she was doing behind your back.

18:34.840 --> 18:38.833
It's a question ofjudgment. I trusted her.

18:40.880 --> 18:43.952
And unless Tom's plan succeeds,

18:45.200 --> 18:48.078
that mistake will bring us to war.

18:53.120 --> 18:55.111
(gasps of pleasure)

19:07.920 --> 19:11.515
And finally, we're done. There we go.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.835
You OK?

19:25.640 --> 19:29.428
I'm great. That was great.

19:29.520 --> 19:31.670
It felt like you were somewhere else.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.914
I'm just tired.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.116
It's been a long day.

19:41.160 --> 19:43.151
I'll be right back.

19:51.520 --> 19:55.479
Do you think he's just concerned,
or suspicious?

19:55.560 --> 20:00.953
I don't know. But she is leaving him alone
with the PDA - this could be it.

20:16.760 --> 20:20.070
Making his move. He's making his move.

20:43.960 --> 20:48.192
That must be the device he's using
to forward the emails to the Russians.

20:50.680 --> 20:53.672
Gentlemen, he is taking the bait.

21:00.320 --> 21:01.309
Come on.

21:02.160 --> 21:04.151
Come on.

21:05.480 --> 21:08.711
Come on, come on, come on.
Send these emails.

21:08.800 --> 21:12.713
(agent) He's not going to, sir.
He's putting her PDA away.

21:24.640 --> 21:28.758
Sweetheart, I'm just gonna pour myself
a glass of wine. You want something?

21:28.840 --> 21:31.798
Sure. I'll have what you're having.

21:55.720 --> 21:57.676
No.

21:57.760 --> 22:01.036
I don't think it's just that you're tired.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.236
What are you talking about?

22:04.240 --> 22:06.356
The way you were in bed -
something's wrong.

22:06.440 --> 22:09.557
- We may have a problem here.
- Everything's fine.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.833
Then why can't you look me in the eye?

22:17.320 --> 22:20.278
You're making me nervous,
staring at me like that.

22:20.360 --> 22:22.590
Can we stop talking about this?

22:22.680 --> 22:25.672
- I know you. You don't get nervous.
- You're hurting me.

22:25.760 --> 22:27.034
- What's going on?
- Nothing!

22:27.120 --> 22:28.792
- You're lying!
- I'm not!

22:28.880 --> 22:30.233
Tell me!

22:30.760 --> 22:32.751
This is not good.

22:37.840 --> 22:42.277
All right, I'll tell you what's going on.
What's going on...

22:42.720 --> 22:45.439
- Get in there quick!
...is you're a lying son of a bitch!

22:45.520 --> 22:47.078
I put myself on the line for you!

22:47.160 --> 22:51.915
All you were doing was whoring yourself
to the Russians, stealing my emails...

22:55.400 --> 22:58.836
- Do you realise what you've done?
- Bitch!

22:59.400 --> 23:02.312
They'll charge me with treason -
I'll be put in jail!

23:02.400 --> 23:04.311
Agh!

23:05.000 --> 23:06.991
(gasps)

23:09.040 --> 23:12.749
Who knows about me and the Russians?
Who knows?

23:14.280 --> 23:16.669
Freeze! Get him off her.

23:19.320 --> 23:21.356
Put Mr Bishop in the bedroom.

23:21.440 --> 23:25.228
(agent) She's got a pulse.
It's faint, but she's breathing.

23:25.320 --> 23:28.039
Let's get an ambulance here fast.

23:34.280 --> 23:40.389
Mr Bishop, I guess you already familiarised
yourself with the White House staff.

23:43.080 --> 23:46.675
May I have a moment alone
with the prisoner?

23:49.160 --> 23:52.994
We have incontrovertible evidence
you were spying for the Russians.

23:53.080 --> 23:56.436
We have recordings of you on the phone
with the agent running you,

23:56.520 --> 23:59.398
and now, of course, we've got this.

24:00.800 --> 24:03.394
Do I have your attention?

24:03.480 --> 24:06.040
All right. So here it is.

24:06.120 --> 24:11.353
You are going to
upload the emails on Ms Miller's PDA

24:11.440 --> 24:14.512
to your Russian employers.

24:14.600 --> 24:17.672
Additionally,
you are going to call your handler

24:17.760 --> 24:19.955
and back up the story these emails tell -

24:20.040 --> 24:24.955
namely that our country destroyed the
circuit board before it fell into Chinese hands.

24:25.040 --> 24:28.953
Now, if you comply,
we'll push for leniency in your sentencing.

24:29.040 --> 24:33.591
If you do not,
I can all but guarantee you the death penalty.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.471
(phone rings)

24:45.480 --> 24:48.040
- What is it, Cheng?
- I lost the boy.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.839
- Who has him?
- CTU and your son.

24:50.920 --> 24:56.472
This is totally unacceptable. The boy
was my price for repairing the circuit board.

24:56.560 --> 24:59.870
I lost many men
trying to give you your price, Mr Bauer.

25:01.000 --> 25:06.074
I really don't give a damn
about your operational incapacities.

25:06.160 --> 25:10.517
- Our arrangement is over.
- It cannot be over. You have our component.

25:10.600 --> 25:15.720
You failed to hold up your end of the deal.
The circuit board is no longer yours.

25:15.800 --> 25:20.032
Repair the circuit board and return it to us,
or there'll be serious consequences!

25:20.480 --> 25:23.916
You listen to me. I'm not afraid of you, Cheng.

25:24.800 --> 25:31.592
And the next time you threaten me, the
consequences will be serious - but not for me.

25:33.040 --> 25:34.871
(speaks Chinese)

25:49.280 --> 25:52.033
- Any luck?
- No.

25:52.120 --> 25:54.873
Have our teams located Cheng
or the sub-circuit board?

25:54.960 --> 25:57.633
- Nothing yet.
- What's the status on our satellite?

25:57.720 --> 26:00.473
We rerouted circuits
through an undamaged subsystem.

26:00.560 --> 26:04.872
- The grid should be back up in ten minutes.
- Try to make it five.

26:04.960 --> 26:07.758
- Nadia Yassir?
- Yeah. Can I help you?

26:07.840 --> 26:10.195
My name is Ben Kram.
I'm from Division.

26:10.280 --> 26:13.590
You should have received a memo
alerting you of my arrival.

26:13.680 --> 26:17.514
- Our systems are still down.
- That's exactly why I'm here.

26:17.600 --> 26:21.513
I've been authorised to compile
an assessment of your security breach.

26:21.600 --> 26:25.559
We're right in the middle
of a recovery operation, and it's 3am -

26:25.640 --> 26:28.950
this isn't the best time
to be questioning my people.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.838
Frankly, I don't particularly care
what you think.

26:31.920 --> 26:36.869
- Excuse me?
- This represents a serious breach in security.

26:36.960 --> 26:40.396
One that resulted in
the loss of a number of CTU personnel.

26:40.480 --> 26:44.314
Obviously mistakes were made,
errors in judgment -

26:44.400 --> 26:47.233
like my accepting
Bill Buchanan's recommendation

26:47.320 --> 26:50.517
to leave someone with
your limited experience in charge.

26:50.600 --> 26:55.116
So, can I count on
your full cooperation or not?

26:56.560 --> 26:59.233
- I never said otherwise.
- Super.

26:59.840 --> 27:02.877
I'll need a full staff roster
and access to all departments,

27:02.960 --> 27:06.794
plus some kind of a station
to set up my investigation.

27:06.880 --> 27:09.553
You can work out of
that conference room there.

27:09.640 --> 27:11.631
Thank you.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.910
- (man) Operations.
- Nadia Yassir.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.073
There is a group from Division here
in conference room B.

27:26.160 --> 27:31.188
- Please give them whatever they need.
- Yes, ma'am. We'll take care of it.

27:35.840 --> 27:38.559
- Nadia.
- Yeah, Morris?

27:38.640 --> 27:43.270
This may not be my place, but don't let
those buggers from Division get to you.

27:43.360 --> 27:49.230
- You're not responsible for what happened.
- Of course I am. It happened on my watch.

27:49.320 --> 27:54.030
There's nothing you could have done.
Do not let them hang you out to dry.

27:54.120 --> 27:58.272
People are dead.
Milo is dead because of me.

27:58.360 --> 28:01.796
That's ridiculous.
There's nothing anyone could have done.

28:01.880 --> 28:06.112
No, I... I could have stood up.
I could have said something.

28:06.200 --> 28:09.397
There was no time. Milo jumped in.

28:10.200 --> 28:12.395
There was time.

28:16.680 --> 28:18.875
I just hesitated.

28:21.360 --> 28:24.432
- I was just...
- You were just afraid?

28:25.760 --> 28:29.036
Yeah, I have a bit of experience with that.

28:29.120 --> 28:32.954
I'm not one to advise on how to handle
self-recrimination, but I know this -

28:33.040 --> 28:36.555
Milo was a brave man.
He never would have sacrificed himself

28:36.640 --> 28:41.430
if he knew you'd allow others
to lay his death at your feet.

28:42.800 --> 28:45.792
He'd want you to stay strong,

28:45.880 --> 28:48.075
stay in charge.

28:59.600 --> 29:02.956
- (intercom beeps)
- (Melinda) Sir, Tom Lennox is on the line.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.837
Thanks.

29:06.040 --> 29:07.519
Tom. I'm with Karen.

29:07.600 --> 29:13.755
That information we planted for the Russians,
that has been sent on to Bishop's contact.

29:13.840 --> 29:16.752
Good. Do you think
it's made its way to Suvarov yet?

29:16.840 --> 29:21.550
I'm confident it has. But I do think a call to
the Russian president, giving him the news,

29:21.640 --> 29:24.598
that might well strengthen
the credibility of our story.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.796
I agree.

29:26.880 --> 29:30.714
- Tom, thanks.
- Sir, there is one other thing.

29:30.800 --> 29:34.475
- What's that?
- We had some complications, and, uh...

29:34.560 --> 29:37.677
Lisa was injured in the operation.

29:39.120 --> 29:42.715
- How badly?
- She had a loss of oxygen to the brain.

29:42.800 --> 29:45.712
We won't know
till she regains consciousness.

29:45.800 --> 29:49.236
- She is on her way to hospital.
- How the hell did this happen?

29:49.320 --> 29:55.714
She attacked Bishop. Before we could even
get in there, he almost strangled her to death.

29:55.800 --> 30:00.396
And what were you doing during all this?
Where was Secret Service?

30:00.480 --> 30:02.596
Sir, we did everything we could.

30:02.680 --> 30:05.831
Itjust happened too fast.

30:05.920 --> 30:07.956
All right, thank you, Tom.

30:08.040 --> 30:11.237
All right. I'll be back there shortly.

30:13.840 --> 30:15.831
I'm so sorry, sir.

30:18.960 --> 30:24.876
I know that, despite her betrayal,
you still have feelings for Lisa.

30:25.480 --> 30:29.598
Unfortunately, we do have
a pressing matter to address.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.153
(sighs)

30:33.240 --> 30:36.550
- Suvarov.
- We've got to call him immediately,

30:36.640 --> 30:41.475
tell him that the Chinese no longer have the
component, and that it has been destroyed.

30:41.560 --> 30:46.156
- Set it up in the TelePresence suite.
- Right away, sir.

30:51.280 --> 30:54.670
We're gonna get you back
to your mom soon, OK? Just sit here.

30:54.760 --> 30:56.352
I'll be right back.

30:56.440 --> 30:58.556
(dials phone)

30:58.640 --> 31:01.950
- (man) Operations.
- This is Jack. Patch me through to Marilyn.

31:02.040 --> 31:05.749
We searched the area and Cheng's vehicles -
no sub-circuit board.

31:05.840 --> 31:09.879
- What about aerial surveillance?
- Nothing. We just now got satellite back.

31:09.960 --> 31:14.556
- It looks like Cheng got out.
- Get your men. We'll go back to CTU.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.358
- (Marilyn) Hello?
- It's me.

31:16.440 --> 31:21.275
- Did they tell you Josh was safe?
- That's all they'll say. When can I see him?

31:21.360 --> 31:23.510
We should be back at CTU in a few minutes.

31:23.600 --> 31:27.354
Marilyn, the Chinese
were doing this for my father.

31:27.440 --> 31:30.034
- They were trying to get Josh to him.
- You sure?

31:30.120 --> 31:33.908
- Yeah. Josh spoke to him.
- What did he tell Josh?

31:34.000 --> 31:37.675
He said he wanted to take him back to China,
that Josh was his legacy.

31:37.760 --> 31:39.751
That's it? That's all he said?

31:39.840 --> 31:41.273
Yeah.

31:42.200 --> 31:46.273
- Can I talk to him?
- Of course. Hold on one second.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.389
Hey, it's your mom.

31:52.280 --> 31:54.316
- Mom.
- Hey!

31:54.400 --> 31:57.358
Hey. Are you OK? Did they hurt you?

31:57.440 --> 31:59.396
No. I'm all right.

32:00.560 --> 32:03.950
I don't know what I would do if I lost you.

32:04.040 --> 32:05.632
Mom...

32:05.720 --> 32:08.917
Uncle Jack, he saved my life.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.355
I know.

32:12.360 --> 32:14.396
I love you so much.

32:14.480 --> 32:17.552
I love you, too, Mom.
I'll see you soon, all right?

32:18.680 --> 32:20.318
OK, honey.

32:24.320 --> 32:26.595
You OK?

32:26.680 --> 32:28.671
Come on. We need to go.

32:36.720 --> 32:40.315
Sir, President Suvarov is standing by for you.

32:42.840 --> 32:45.035
Whenever you're ready.

32:47.120 --> 32:49.156
Let's do this.

32:57.120 --> 33:02.877
President Suvarov, you have a secure
conference with Vice President Daniels.

33:02.960 --> 33:05.872
Mr President,
I have some good news to share with you.

33:05.960 --> 33:08.474
What is this good news, Mr Vice President?

33:08.560 --> 33:11.677
We were successful
in taking out the Chinese agents

33:11.760 --> 33:15.196
attempting to smuggle
the FB-sub-circuit board out of the country.

33:15.280 --> 33:18.158
You have the component
back in your possession?

33:18.240 --> 33:20.071
No, sir.

33:20.160 --> 33:23.436
The sub-circuit board was destroyed
when we attacked the Chinese.

33:23.520 --> 33:27.069
I see. I assume you have proof of this.

33:27.160 --> 33:29.310
Yes, we do.

33:29.400 --> 33:32.358
In addition to fragments
from the destroyed component,

33:32.440 --> 33:35.273
I'll give you whatever images
or documentation you need

33:35.360 --> 33:39.638
to assure you
that this threat's been neutralised.

33:40.600 --> 33:45.390
Do you mean the same documentation
you planted with one of my agents?

33:49.760 --> 33:51.716
- Excuse me?
- The same images

33:51.800 --> 33:54.997
you coerced him into sending to my people

33:55.080 --> 34:00.518
of a strike that accomplished nothing
but destroying an empty building?

34:00.600 --> 34:03.558
Yes, I know you exposed
one of my operatives.

34:03.640 --> 34:08.475
I had him under surveillance, which is how
I know about your raid on his apartment.

34:08.560 --> 34:10.994
- Mr President...
- If the Chinese agent

34:11.080 --> 34:15.516
in possession of the sub-circuit board
is allowed to transfer it to his government,

34:15.600 --> 34:19.434
the entire Russian defence system
will be compromised.

34:19.520 --> 34:22.989
I told you I would hold you
and your government responsible.

34:23.080 --> 34:26.277
I will not tolerate any threats
from you, Mr President.

34:26.360 --> 34:30.478
We're doing everything in our power to
ensure the component doesn't reach China.

34:30.560 --> 34:33.791
I have already given you
ample time to recover it.

34:33.880 --> 34:36.952
Now I am feeling less generous.

34:37.719 --> 34:42.110
If you do not deliver concrete
and irrefutable proof to our embassy

34:42.199 --> 34:46.193
that you have recovered or destroyed
this component within two hours,

34:46.280 --> 34:50.319
I will have no choice but to extend
my country's forward perimeter,

34:50.400 --> 34:53.551
to compensate
for our defensive vulnerabilities.

34:54.600 --> 34:58.388
You are talking about attacking
one of our military bases,

34:58.480 --> 35:03.110
and I would urge you
to consider the consequences of that.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.589
We have just as many troops in that area,

35:05.680 --> 35:10.913
and allies will not look kindly upon
any unprovoked aggression on my country.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.276
You and I both know it will not be unprovoked.

35:14.360 --> 35:17.079
This is a matter of survival for us.

35:18.040 --> 35:21.669
It is in both our interests
that you get that component back.

35:22.400 --> 35:25.517
You have two hours.

35:30.280 --> 35:33.989
- It was all for nothing.
- Excuse me, sir?

35:34.440 --> 35:36.749
This ruse, it bought us nothing.

35:38.680 --> 35:41.717
We're about to go to war
over a piece of circuitry.

35:58.560 --> 36:01.120
The agenda for the briefing with the military.

36:01.200 --> 36:04.476
- When did they start?
- A few minutes ago, in the Oval Office.

36:04.560 --> 36:07.358
- I'll play catch-up.
- (phone rings)

36:07.440 --> 36:09.874
Tom Lennox.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.190
Who?

36:13.280 --> 36:15.271
All right, put him through.

36:15.360 --> 36:20.593
The Russians are blaming us for allowing
the theft, and are preparing to retaliate.

36:20.680 --> 36:23.433
Our efforts to reacquire
the component have failed,

36:23.520 --> 36:25.988
so we have no choice
but to defend ourselves,

36:26.080 --> 36:31.279
and to make provisions for the escalation of
this conflict beyond the Central Asian theatre.

36:31.360 --> 36:32.839
(door opens)

36:32.920 --> 36:36.196
- Excuse me, Mr Vice President.
- Glad you could make it.

36:36.280 --> 36:39.477
General Crane was about to run
some response scenarios.

36:39.560 --> 36:44.759
Before we do that, sir, I need
a moment alone with you and Karen.

36:46.680 --> 36:49.877
Excuse us, ladies and gentlemen.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.553
Phillip Bauer calling for you
on a scrambled line.

36:58.640 --> 37:02.428
- What does he want?
- Dunno. But he's in league with the Chinese.

37:02.520 --> 37:06.069
- I think we need to hear him out.
- Put him on speaker.

37:10.600 --> 37:14.149
- Mr Bauer.
- Thank you for taking my call.

37:14.600 --> 37:18.434
- What's this about?
- I think you know what this is about.

37:19.080 --> 37:21.753
Tell me anyway,
so there's no miscommunication.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.513
I want my grandson.

37:24.600 --> 37:27.478
And I want clear passage
to the country of my choice.

37:27.560 --> 37:32.315
Give me that,
and I'll give you the FB-sub-circuit board.

37:32.400 --> 37:35.472
You're working with the Chinese.

37:35.560 --> 37:37.551
I was.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.595
They had their chance, they blew it.

37:41.680 --> 37:44.956
How do I know
you even have this component?

37:47.880 --> 37:50.599
Serial number: 3-P-T-L-3.

37:51.760 --> 37:54.957
Check it against any records you have.

37:57.320 --> 38:01.598
- (Lennox) Yeah, there it is, sir.
- You realise what you're asking?

38:01.680 --> 38:05.992
I'm offering you the opportunity of avoiding
a conflict this country does not want.

38:06.080 --> 38:09.390
A war this country cannot afford.

38:09.480 --> 38:11.835
Not after what's happened today.

38:11.920 --> 38:15.356
I'll send my instructions
on an encrypted data stream.

38:15.440 --> 38:17.829
- Mr Bauer?
- (hangs up)

38:19.000 --> 38:22.117
Sir, you are not seriously considering this?

38:22.200 --> 38:25.317
Phillip Bauer is a federal fugitive,

38:25.400 --> 38:28.597
complicit in selling
nuclear weapons to terrorists.

38:28.680 --> 38:32.468
- I know what crimes he's committed.
- Then how can you negotiate with him?

38:32.560 --> 38:37.315
- Cos maybe we can't afford not to.
- You'd trade the life of an innocent boy?

38:37.400 --> 38:40.517
It'd be the lives of a lot more men
if we go to war with Russia.

38:40.600 --> 38:43.672
And you think Phillip Bauer
is somebody that we can trust?

38:43.760 --> 38:46.433
The man is a sociopath!

38:49.880 --> 38:50.756
Tom?

38:50.840 --> 38:53.798
He is a sociopath. She's right about that.

38:55.280 --> 38:59.637
But given the stakes,
this is a risk worth taking, sir.

39:01.720 --> 39:03.915
None of this makes sense.

39:04.000 --> 39:08.835
Suvarov wouldn't risk military engagement,
even for this piece of technology.

39:08.920 --> 39:12.037
- Unless he's being squeezed.
- Who by? His cabinet?

39:12.120 --> 39:14.156
No. The military.

39:14.240 --> 39:17.835
Gredenko was not the only
anti-American general in the Soviet regime.

39:17.920 --> 39:22.630
Yes, some of them are still in power,
and Suvarov does rely on them.

39:22.720 --> 39:26.554
You think these generals are just
looking for an excuse to pull the trigger.

39:26.640 --> 39:29.598
Certainly sounds plausible, sir.

39:29.680 --> 39:33.389
Well, if that is the case,
then we have no choice.

39:33.480 --> 39:37.393
We have to recover that stolen circuit board.

39:37.480 --> 39:39.471
Get me CTU.

39:57.080 --> 40:02.200
As soon as we get back to CTU, you and your
mother will be transported to a safe location.

40:02.280 --> 40:06.159
- How long will we be there?
- Until we find your grandfather.

40:06.240 --> 40:09.437
When you find him,
what are you gonna do to him?

40:10.040 --> 40:12.713
Josh, I don't want you worrying about this.

40:12.800 --> 40:15.439
He will never threaten you
or your mother again.

40:15.520 --> 40:18.432
Agent Bauer. It's a call for you. It's urgent.

40:18.520 --> 40:21.114
Get in the car. I'll be right there.

40:23.640 --> 40:26.029
- You need to come with me.
- What do you mean?

40:26.120 --> 40:28.111
Come now!

40:28.200 --> 40:30.031
- Uncle Jack!
- Agent Doyle!

40:30.560 --> 40:32.357
- Uncle Jack!
- Agent Doyle!

40:32.440 --> 40:34.908
Orders, Jack. Go back to CTU.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.991
The boy stays with me!

40:37.080 --> 40:39.719
Get outta my way!

40:39.800 --> 40:42.394
- (agent) Hold him back!
- What are you doing?

40:42.480 --> 40:45.313
- Uncle Jack!
- Take him to CTU.

40:45.400 --> 40:48.949
- Uncle Jack!
- (agent) Hold him back. Restrain him.

40:50.600 --> 40:51.669
Josh!

40:52.280 --> 40:53.759
