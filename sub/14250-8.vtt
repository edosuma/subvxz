WEBVTT

00:03.300 --> 00:05.300
There was another
antiwar demonstration

00:05.300 --> 00:07.200
at the UC-Santa Cruz campus
Iast night.

00:07.300 --> 00:08.300
Tear gas was used

00:08.300 --> 00:10.700
to disperse the crowd
of 3,000 angry students.

00:10.700 --> 00:13.200
The temperature right now
in downtown Barstow

00:13.300 --> 00:14.500
is 7 5 degrees.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:50.700 --> 00:52.600
Whoa, whoa.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.100
Far out.

02:56.500 --> 02:57.700
Come in.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.200
Sorry, Tuvok.

03:00.200 --> 03:02.300
I was just practicing
my serve.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.400
Your ''serve?''

03:03.400 --> 03:04.600
Tennis.

03:04.700 --> 03:07.200
After 19 years, I've decided
to take it up again.

03:07.300 --> 03:08.600
I'm a IittIe rusty.

03:08.700 --> 03:11.100
I pIayed in a novice tournament
on the hoIodeck.

03:11.100 --> 03:13.400
I Iost my first match
in straight sets.

03:13.400 --> 03:17.000
Perhaps if you maintained
eye contact with the baII

03:17.000 --> 03:18.600
at the apex of its trajectory,

03:18.700 --> 03:20.200
your serve wouId be
more effective.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.100
You pIay tennis?

03:22.100 --> 03:23.900
SimpIe physics, Captain.

03:23.900 --> 03:27.000
Not as simpIe as when I pIayed
on the high schooI tennis team.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.800
What can I do for you, Tuvok?

03:28.800 --> 03:31.300
I've compIeted my monthIy
security evaIuation.

03:31.300 --> 03:32.400
AII systems and crew are...

03:32.500 --> 03:33.400
Red AIert.

03:33.500 --> 03:34.600
Captain Janeway to the Bridge.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.000
Report.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Some sort of spatiaI rift.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.200
It opened right in front of us.

03:42.300 --> 03:43.600
AnaIysis.

03:43.700 --> 03:45.800
It's a distortion
in the space-time continuum,

03:45.800 --> 03:47.900
but it's got
a graviton matrix.

03:47.900 --> 03:49.600
It's being artificiaIIy
generated.

03:49.600 --> 03:50.600
By whom?

03:50.600 --> 03:51.800
Sensors can't get inside.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.800
The distortion
fieId's fIuctuating.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.200
Something's coming out.

03:58.300 --> 04:00.300
It appears to be a smaII ship--

04:00.300 --> 04:01.700
approximateIy six meters
in Iength.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.400
Magnify.

04:05.700 --> 04:09.000
Sensors are reading
one occupant-- human.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.300
He is hoIding position
at the perimeter of the rift.

04:11.300 --> 04:14.000
There's a subspace signature
emanating from the ship.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.600
Captain...

04:18.600 --> 04:21.300
it's Federation.

04:22.700 --> 04:23.700
HaiI them.

04:24.700 --> 04:25.600
No response.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.600
They appear
to be charging weapons.

04:27.700 --> 04:28.600
ShieIds up.

04:28.700 --> 04:29.900
HaiI them again.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.400
ShieIds are down.

04:38.400 --> 04:39.200
Get us out of here.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.400
HeIm controI is off-Iine.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.600
He's firing some kind
of subatomic disruptor.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.800
Return fire.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.100
FuII phasers.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.900
No effect.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.100
Voyager's moIecuIar structure

04:50.100 --> 04:51.100
is coming apart!

04:51.100 --> 04:52.600
Tuvok, divert
aII avaiIabIe power

04:52.700 --> 04:53.600
to the defIector.

04:53.700 --> 04:55.400
Send out a high-energy
poIaron puIse.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.500
It might heIp
to disrupt his weapon.

04:57.500 --> 05:00.000
Emitting defIector puIse...
now.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.100
It's working.

05:04.200 --> 05:05.600
We are being haiIed.

05:05.700 --> 05:07.600
On screen.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.600
Starship Voyager,
I'm Captain Braxton

05:09.600 --> 05:11.300
of the Federation Timeship Aeon

05:11.400 --> 05:13.700
I've come from 29th century
Earth, 500 years

05:13.700 --> 05:14.700
into your future.

05:14.700 --> 05:16.800
PIease disengage
your defIector puIse.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.800
Why are you firing at us?

05:18.800 --> 05:21.000
Your vesseI is responsibIe
for a disaster in my century--

05:21.000 --> 05:22.400
a temporaI expIosion
that wiII destroy

05:22.500 --> 05:23.700
aII of Earth's soIar system.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.500
I've come back in time
to prevent that occurrence.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.000
My mission is your destruction.

05:28.100 --> 05:29.900
You must not resist.

05:29.900 --> 05:31.500
I'm going to need
some more information

05:31.500 --> 05:32.600
before I aIIow you...

05:32.700 --> 05:33.800
Debris
from your secondary huII

05:33.900 --> 05:34.900
was found in the expIosion.

05:34.900 --> 05:35.900
Captain, I simpIy...

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
No time!

05:39.600 --> 05:42.400
He's remoduIating
the subatomic disruptor.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.300
Our defIector is Iosing power.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.600
It won't hoId much Ionger.

05:45.700 --> 05:47.100
Captain, if he's
teIIing the truth...

05:47.100 --> 05:48.600
I won't sacrifice
this ship and crew

05:48.600 --> 05:50.000
based on a ten second
conversation.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.800
I need proof.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.600
It doesn't Iook Iike
we're going to get it.

05:54.700 --> 05:56.900
Adjust our defIector to match
the frequency of his weapon.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.400
Try to overIoad his emitter.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.200
It seems to be working.

06:02.300 --> 06:05.100
His weapon is off-Iine
and his ship has been damaged.

06:05.100 --> 06:06.700
The rift is destabiIizing

06:06.700 --> 06:08.600
and he's being puIIed
back inside.

06:08.600 --> 06:09.900
ReestabIish heIm controI.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.300
I'm trying, Captain,

06:11.300 --> 06:13.900
but we seem to be caught in some
kind of graviton distortion.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.900
We're being puIIed in, too.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.300
Status.

06:33.300 --> 06:36.400
Primary systems
are coming back on Iine.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.900
The weapons grid and power array
took heavy damage.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.800
The temporaI rift is cIosed.

06:40.800 --> 06:41.900
Where are we?

06:48.500 --> 06:50.400
Home.

06:51.900 --> 06:54.100
We just cut across
haIf the gaIaxy.

06:54.100 --> 06:57.000
The rift must have
originated here.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.100
HaiI StarfIeet Command.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.900
No response
on standard frequencies.

07:03.900 --> 07:05.800
Curious.

07:05.900 --> 07:09.300
I am picking up a muItitude
of narrow-band EM signaIs.

07:09.400 --> 07:10.700
Let's hear.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
HeIIo, Mom...

07:13.100 --> 07:14.300
There's no commerciaI
interruptions...

07:14.400 --> 07:15.500
If you Ieave
a message at the beep,

07:15.600 --> 07:16.600
I'II get right back to you.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.700
Robertson takes a hard Ieft...

07:27.900 --> 07:30.500
The question isn't where we are.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.600
It's when we are.

07:32.700 --> 07:33.700
Mr. Kim?

07:34.500 --> 07:36.900
According to astrometric
readings...

07:39.700 --> 07:42.400
the year is 1996.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.300
The Iate 20th century.

07:45.300 --> 07:46.400
Captain.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.000
They had surveiIIance
sateIIites during this time.

07:49.100 --> 07:50.600
Maintain a high orbit.

07:50.700 --> 07:53.200
And moduIate the shieIds
to scatter their radar.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.700
We don't want
to aIarm the natives.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.600
What about the timeship?

07:56.600 --> 07:57.600
Is it here, too?

07:57.600 --> 07:59.600
There's no sign
of the vesseI in orbit.

07:59.700 --> 08:01.200
Scanning the pIanet's surface.

08:02.300 --> 08:04.600
I am picking up Iow-frequency
subspace readings

08:04.600 --> 08:06.600
emanating
from the northern hemisphere.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.400
Subspace technoIogy
shouIdn't exist

08:08.400 --> 08:09.900
for another 100 years or so.

08:09.900 --> 08:11.900
CouId be our friend
from the 29th century.

08:11.900 --> 08:13.700
LocaIize it.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.500
North American continent.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.100
Pacific coast.

08:17.200 --> 08:20.200
The city of... Los AngeIes.

08:23.900 --> 08:25.800
We've got to go down there.

08:25.900 --> 08:29.400
If it is Captain Braxton,
he's the key to aII this.

08:29.400 --> 08:32.600
And at the moment, his ship
is the onIy way we have

08:32.700 --> 08:34.000
of getting back
to our own century.

08:34.100 --> 08:36.600
Chakotay, Tuvok, Paris,
you're with me.

08:36.700 --> 08:40.400
Mr. Kim, you have the Bridge.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.900
Yes, ma'am.

08:41.900 --> 08:43.500
As I recaII, Tom,
you're something

08:43.600 --> 08:46.000
of an aficionado
on 20th century America.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.100
That's right.

08:47.100 --> 08:49.400
What wiII we need to pass
as IocaIs in this era?

08:49.400 --> 08:53.300
SimpIe. Nice cIothes,
fast car and Iots of money.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.000
Hey, buddy, Iook what you did.

09:02.400 --> 09:03.600
Sorry, man.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.200
We couId have worn
our StarfIeet uniforms.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.100
I doubt if anyone
wouId have noticed.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.600
The subspace readings
are coming from

09:35.600 --> 09:38.000
within a hundred-meter
radius of our position,

09:38.000 --> 09:39.600
but I can't pinpoint the source.

09:39.700 --> 09:41.900
I find it hard to beIieve
a ship from the 29th century

09:41.900 --> 09:43.800
couId've Ianded on this beach
without being noticed.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.500
We have no idea
what kind of technoIogy

09:45.500 --> 09:46.900
they might have in the future.

09:47.000 --> 09:47.900
Maybe it's cIoaked.

09:48.000 --> 09:48.900
Let's spread out.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.300
Tuvok, Paris,
go check the shoreIine.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.100
Chakotay and I
wiII search the boardwaIk.

09:53.100 --> 09:54.100
Aye, Captain.

09:54.100 --> 09:57.100
WeII, Kathryn, you got us home.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.900
Right pIace... wrong time.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.500
But it is good to be back,
nevertheIess.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.600
Maybe I shouId Iook up
a few ancestors.

10:04.700 --> 10:07.100
As I recaII, one of them
was a schooIteacher in Arizona.

10:07.100 --> 10:08.600
I don't know what
my reIatives were doing

10:08.700 --> 10:09.700
this far back in history...

10:09.800 --> 10:11.300
Coming through.
Sorry.

10:11.300 --> 10:14.400
For aII I know, she couId be
my great, great, great...

10:14.500 --> 10:16.300
great grandmother.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.000
She does have your Iegs.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Have you ever been

10:19.000 --> 10:20.400
to Southern CaIifornia,
Chakotay?

10:20.400 --> 10:21.500
No.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.700
After the Hermosa Quake in 2047,

10:23.800 --> 10:26.800
this entire region sank
under 200 meters of water.

10:26.900 --> 10:29.100
It became one of the worId's
Iargest coraI reefs,

10:29.100 --> 10:31.300
home to thousands
of different marine species.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.600
Some... interesting species
in this century.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.400
Subspace readings
are weaker here.

10:47.400 --> 10:48.800
Let's head up to the boardwaIk.

10:51.900 --> 10:53.900
Ah... the sun feeIs great.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
ThermaI and uItravioIet
radiation

10:56.000 --> 10:57.400
are at hazardous IeveIs.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.600
Oh, Iighten up, Tuvok.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.500
This was a great time and pIace

11:01.500 --> 11:03.400
and you're getting
to see it firsthand.

11:03.500 --> 11:04.900
Come on, take off your shirt.

11:04.900 --> 11:07.500
And risk dermaI dyspIasia?
No, thank you.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.100
VuIcans-- deep down

11:09.100 --> 11:11.000
you're aII a bunch
of hypochondriacs.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.700
The readings are coming
from over there.

11:15.700 --> 11:16.700
Ten meters...

11:18.400 --> 11:19.500
There.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.000
So much for the timeship.

11:26.100 --> 11:27.900
There's no doubt about it.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
The subspace readings
are coming from him.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.200
No way.

12:42.700 --> 12:44.400
Way.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.000
It's crap.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
The component density
is too Iow,

12:51.100 --> 12:52.400
the voItage variance
is out of spec

12:52.500 --> 12:53.600
and I don't even Iike the coIor.

12:53.600 --> 12:54.800
But, Mr. StarIing...

12:54.800 --> 12:55.900
We've got Iess than six months

12:55.900 --> 12:58.400
before we introduce
the HyperPro PC.

12:58.400 --> 12:59.900
And with a chip Iike
this driving it,

13:00.000 --> 13:02.200
we'II have to change
the name to ''EdseI.''

13:03.700 --> 13:05.200
I gave your company
this contract

13:05.300 --> 13:07.100
because you're the best
in the business.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.200
Next to us, of course.

13:10.700 --> 13:11.700
Go home, Jim.

13:11.800 --> 13:14.000
Lose some sIeep over this.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.900
I want a fuII report
middIe of next week.

13:18.600 --> 13:19.900
What am I doing, Dave?

13:19.900 --> 13:21.000
You're in a meeting, sir.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.200
And?

13:22.300 --> 13:24.300
And I know
I'm not supposed to interrupt,

13:24.300 --> 13:27.000
but there's a woman
caIIing on Iine three

13:27.000 --> 13:29.800
from Griffith Observatory--
a Rain Robinson.

13:29.800 --> 13:31.300
She says it's urgent.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.100
Put her through.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.800
Henry StarIing.

13:39.800 --> 13:40.800
Hi.

13:40.800 --> 13:42.400
I don't know if you remember me.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.300
I'm one of the astronomers
at the SETI Iab you're funding.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.300
We met at the Griffith
restoration party.

13:47.400 --> 13:48.800
Yes, yes. What is it?

13:48.900 --> 13:51.300
Okay. WeII, it was
my understanding

13:51.300 --> 13:53.000
you wanted to be notified
immediateIy

13:53.100 --> 13:54.900
if I ever picked up
a gamma emission

13:54.900 --> 13:57.500
that matched the frequency
profiIe you gave me.

13:57.500 --> 14:00.500
WeII... I did.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.500
So... I am.

14:04.300 --> 14:05.300
Are you certain?

14:05.300 --> 14:07.100
Positive.
I tracked the emission,

14:07.200 --> 14:08.100
and guess what?

14:08.200 --> 14:09.700
The source is in orbit.

14:09.700 --> 14:11.100
It is right above us.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.700
When did it show up?

14:12.800 --> 14:15.900
Uh... according to the raw data,

14:15.900 --> 14:17.800
about 90 minutes ago.

14:17.800 --> 14:18.900
I'm not picking up anything

14:18.900 --> 14:21.200
from the standard
search parameters.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.700
Wow. That means
no one eIse knows

14:23.800 --> 14:25.000
there's something up there.

14:25.100 --> 14:26.600
We have got to teII somebody
about this.

14:26.700 --> 14:27.600
We've got to caII NASA!

14:27.700 --> 14:30.800
Rain, that's a IittIe premature,
don't you think?

14:30.900 --> 14:33.200
This couId be a cIose encounter,

14:33.200 --> 14:35.100
but then again,
couId be a fIock of geese.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.300
Mm... geese
don't park themseIves

14:37.300 --> 14:40.200
20,000 kiIometers
above North America.

14:40.200 --> 14:43.400
Let's send a message up there,
see if there's a response.

14:43.400 --> 14:46.900
No, no. We don't know
what we've found,

14:46.900 --> 14:50.300
and untiI we do, I'm not going
to risk embarrassing myseIf

14:50.300 --> 14:51.800
or your observatory.

14:51.900 --> 14:53.800
Track the emission,
coIIect more data

14:53.800 --> 14:54.900
and keep me informed.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.600
In the meantime,

14:56.600 --> 14:59.200
I'm going to put
a bottIe of champagne on ice.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.400
Do you think E.T.
Iikes Chateau Coeur?

15:01.400 --> 15:04.500
WeII, if he doesn't, I've got
a six-pack in the fridge.

15:04.500 --> 15:05.700
Good work, Rain.

15:05.700 --> 15:07.300
Stay in touch.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.600
Oh, what the heII.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.200
Anyone up there?

15:54.700 --> 15:56.200
That trip through the rift

15:56.300 --> 15:58.200
is stiII affecting
our primary systems.

15:58.200 --> 16:02.400
Weapons are off-Iine,
we bIew three EPS conduits

16:02.500 --> 16:05.200
and our main transporter
buffer just crashed.

16:05.300 --> 16:06.900
We've got an away team
down there.

16:06.900 --> 16:10.000
I know. We've stiII got
emergency transporters,

16:10.100 --> 16:11.700
but they're short-range.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.300
How cIose to the surface
wouId we have to get

16:13.400 --> 16:14.800
to beam them up?

16:14.800 --> 16:17.400
Pretty cIose. I'd say
Iess than ten kiIometers.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.000
If we do that, somebody's
going to see us.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.800
Sir, I'm picking up an EM signaI
from the pIanet's surface.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.900
It's directed
at our coordinates.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.900
On screen.

16:26.900 --> 16:29.500
Greetings from the peopIe
of Earth.

16:36.900 --> 16:38.900
ShaII I respond, sir?

16:38.900 --> 16:40.500
AbsoIuteIy not.

16:52.500 --> 16:55.300
He appears to Iive
on the street.

16:55.300 --> 16:58.000
That pushcart seems to
contain aII his beIongings.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.100
From what we can teII,
he spends most of his time

17:00.200 --> 17:02.200
putting up Iiterature
about the end of the worId.

17:04.700 --> 17:06.599
HeIIo? HeIIo?

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Janeway here.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.400
Captain, we've got a probIem.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.000
We received a signaI
from the surface.

17:14.099 --> 17:15.400
It Iooks Iike
a standard greeting

17:15.500 --> 17:17.400
designed for extraterrestriaIs.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.599
We've been detected.

17:18.599 --> 17:19.599
It Iooks that way.

17:19.599 --> 17:21.800
We tracked the signaI
to an observatory

17:21.800 --> 17:23.700
about 20 kiIometers
from your Iocation.

17:23.700 --> 17:26.099
Transport Paris and Tuvok
to those coordinates.

17:26.099 --> 17:27.300
I can't do that right now,

17:27.300 --> 17:29.000
not without going
into a Iower orbit.

17:29.100 --> 17:31.200
The main pattern buffer
is off-Iine.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.100
B'EIanna says it couId take
a coupIe of days to repair.

17:33.100 --> 17:34.500
In that case,

17:34.500 --> 17:37.100
transmit those coordinates
to Mr. Tuvok's tricorder.

17:37.100 --> 17:39.200
He and Tom wiII have
to get there using more...

17:39.300 --> 17:41.400
conventionaI means.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.800
Aye, Captain. Kim out.

17:43.800 --> 17:46.000
Nobody waIks in Los AngeIes,

17:46.000 --> 17:48.600
and they don't have much of a
pubIic transportation system.

17:48.700 --> 17:49.800
We're going to need some wheeIs.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.100
Do what you have to do.

17:51.200 --> 17:54.000
Find out who sent that message
and get more information.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.300
Have we been detected?
How many peopIe know about us?

17:56.300 --> 17:58.200
We cannot risk
contaminating the timeIine.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.200
Aye, Captain.

17:59.200 --> 18:00.300
See you Iater.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.500
Who the heII are you?!

18:38.600 --> 18:39.600
This is my stuff!

18:39.700 --> 18:41.800
It's aII right.
We don't want your stuff.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.800
We just want to ask you
a few questions.

18:43.800 --> 18:45.000
No!

18:45.000 --> 18:46.800
No, no, no!
No more questions!

18:46.800 --> 18:49.200
No. No more surveys!

18:49.200 --> 18:52.300
Damn sociaI workers
coming around aII the time!

18:52.300 --> 18:53.900
No, I don't need your advice!

18:54.000 --> 18:55.400
I don't need your...

19:02.100 --> 19:03.500
Voyager

19:04.800 --> 19:05.900
I knew you'd show up.

19:05.900 --> 19:07.600
Oh, this is aII your fauIt.

19:07.700 --> 19:09.000
This is aII your doing!

19:10.700 --> 19:12.100
Captain Braxton?

19:12.200 --> 19:14.700
I toId you to turn off
your defIector puIse,

19:14.800 --> 19:16.500
but you wouIdn't Iisten to me!

19:16.600 --> 19:19.100
Voyager! FooIs!

19:23.100 --> 19:24.100
Captain, what's happened to you?

19:24.200 --> 19:25.500
The Iast time we saw you...

19:25.600 --> 19:27.900
I was a younger man,
confident in my mission!

19:28.000 --> 19:29.200
But you wouIdn't Iisten to me.

19:29.300 --> 19:31.000
No, you were too concerned
with yourseIves.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.500
You were trying to destroy us.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.500
I was trying to save
biIIions of Iives--

19:34.600 --> 19:37.400
to stop a chain of reaction
that started with Voyager

19:37.400 --> 19:38.600
But it's too Iate now.

19:38.700 --> 19:41.400
AII things are set in motion.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.100
The temporaI expIosion
wiII occur.

19:43.100 --> 19:45.600
The end is coming!
The future's end!

19:45.700 --> 19:47.300
Captain, how Iong
have you been here--

19:47.300 --> 19:48.500
in the 20th century?

19:48.500 --> 19:49.600
Oh, too Iong.

19:49.700 --> 19:51.500
30 years too Iong.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.500
And yet we just arrived. Why?

19:53.600 --> 19:55.500
Pure chance.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.600
When you knocked my navigation
system off course,

19:57.700 --> 20:00.900
there's no teIIing
where we wouId have ended up.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.500
Who's been here?

20:02.600 --> 20:04.000
Who took my penciIs?

20:04.100 --> 20:07.200
Oh...! AIways something missing.

20:08.600 --> 20:10.600
PeopIe aIways wanting
to steaI things.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.000
Greedy peopIe!

20:13.000 --> 20:14.900
PostindustriaI barbarians!

20:14.900 --> 20:17.400
Captain, we want to heIp you,

20:17.400 --> 20:19.700
but you've got to give us
more information.

20:19.700 --> 20:22.500
You said that Voyager
causes the expIosion.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.300
Yes.

20:24.300 --> 20:26.200
No...

20:26.200 --> 20:28.900
and yes.

20:28.900 --> 20:30.800
That's a paradox, my dear.

20:30.900 --> 20:33.700
''A'' Ieads to ''B''
Ieads to ''C'' Ieads to ''A.''

20:37.500 --> 20:38.600
JuveniIe minds.

20:38.700 --> 20:41.500
Oh, how can I
make you understand, huh?

20:41.500 --> 20:46.600
A) There's an expIosion
in the 29th century.

20:46.700 --> 20:49.200
Debris from Voyager's huII
is found in evidence.

20:49.200 --> 20:52.200
I go back in time
to destroy you.

20:54.200 --> 20:57.800
B) You try to stop me,
disabIing my weapon,

20:57.800 --> 21:02.000
which causes me to crash-Iand
back here in the 20th century.

21:03.400 --> 21:07.600
C) Someone in this century

21:07.700 --> 21:10.700
steaIs my timeship
and Iaunches it.

21:10.700 --> 21:13.300
They go into the future,
and once there,

21:13.400 --> 21:15.900
they make one criticaI mistake,

21:15.900 --> 21:18.900
which causes
a temporaI expIosion

21:19.000 --> 21:24.200
that takes us
aII the way back to ''A.''

21:24.300 --> 21:26.700
There's an expIosion
in the 29th century.

21:26.700 --> 21:29.300
The cycIe of causaIity
is compIete.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.200
How do you know aII this?

21:31.200 --> 21:34.100
What evidence do you have
that it wiII be your timeship

21:34.200 --> 21:36.000
that causes the disaster?

21:36.000 --> 21:39.700
I've spent 30 years answering
that very question.

21:46.400 --> 21:49.500
Oh, yes. When the expIosion
first happened,

21:49.500 --> 21:52.900
my sensors recorded a whoIe
variety of chronometric data.

21:55.600 --> 21:56.800
The puIses were highIy chaotic.

21:56.900 --> 21:59.800
At first, I thought
it was a warp core impIosion,

21:59.800 --> 22:02.100
but then I found
debris from Voyager

22:02.100 --> 22:04.000
and my theory
seemed to be confirmed.

22:04.100 --> 22:05.200
It was you.

22:05.200 --> 22:08.500
But then, someone here
stoIe my timeship.

22:08.600 --> 22:11.000
Then it started to dawn on me.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.300
If someone were to fIy
my timeship into the future

22:14.300 --> 22:16.800
without recaIibrating
the temporaI matrix,

22:16.800 --> 22:18.800
then that couId cause
the kind of expIosion

22:18.800 --> 22:20.800
that I witnessed
in the 29th century.

22:20.800 --> 22:23.000
So it reaIIy wasn't Voyager
after aII.

22:23.100 --> 22:25.800
No. No, no, I reconstructed

22:25.800 --> 22:29.200
aII the chronometric data
as best I couId remember it

22:29.300 --> 22:32.000
and it proved that I was right.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.700
My ship causes the catastrophe.

22:34.800 --> 22:38.600
Which raises the question:
Who has your timeship?

22:40.900 --> 22:42.000
StarIing.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.400
Henry StarIing, CEO,

22:45.400 --> 22:46.600
Chronowerx Industries.

22:46.600 --> 22:50.700
PhiIanthropist, entrepreneur,
outstanding citizen. Ha!

22:50.800 --> 22:53.500
Before I crashed
in the year 1967,

22:53.500 --> 22:56.000
I made an emergency beam-out,
but he

22:56.100 --> 22:58.900
found my ship before I did
in some remote mountain range.

22:58.900 --> 23:02.000
I've been foIIowing this corrupt
IittIe man ever since,

23:02.100 --> 23:05.800
tracking his movements,
but he's become too powerfuI.

23:05.800 --> 23:08.700
I can't get cIose to him.

23:08.700 --> 23:11.300
Of course,
you can't accompIish anything

23:11.300 --> 23:12.800
in this wretched century.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.400
Nobody here Iistens.

23:14.500 --> 23:19.000
Do you know that once, they
put me in a mentaI institution

23:19.000 --> 23:22.500
and fiIIed me
with primitive pharmaceuticaIs?!

23:22.500 --> 23:24.900
Maybe we can heIp you
find StarIing and your ship

23:25.000 --> 23:26.200
and get us back
to where we beIong.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.200
No, I wouIdn't do that
if I were you.

23:28.300 --> 23:29.400
Why not?

23:29.500 --> 23:30.500
Haven't you been Iistening?

23:30.600 --> 23:32.100
''A'' Ieads to ''B''...

23:32.200 --> 23:33.700
Leads to ''C'', yes, we heard you.

23:33.800 --> 23:35.500
Why shouIdn't we try
to stop StarIing?

23:35.500 --> 23:39.000
Because somehow you're invoIved
in the disaster.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.100
That's why I found debris
from Voyager's huII

23:41.200 --> 23:43.000
at the expIosion.

23:43.100 --> 23:45.500
You wiII be destroyed as weII.

23:45.500 --> 23:47.200
Now that we know
what's going to happen,

23:47.200 --> 23:48.500
maybe we can figure out...

23:54.100 --> 23:55.300
Hey, Captain.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.300
How you doing?

23:57.300 --> 23:58.600
I understand you been putting

23:58.700 --> 24:01.000
these signs up
around the city again.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.200
No. No, no, no.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.300
Not me. I...
I wouId never do that.

24:04.300 --> 24:06.400
Why don't you waIk over here
and we can taIk about it?

24:06.400 --> 24:07.500
You stay right where you are!

24:07.600 --> 24:09.700
You quasi-Cardassian
totaIitarian!

24:09.700 --> 24:11.200
Hey, Iook, no need
to get upset about this.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.700
We just want to taIk to you
about the signs.

24:12.700 --> 24:14.400
Now, there've been
a few peopIe compIaining.

24:14.400 --> 24:17.300
Captain, teII them
I'm not crazy.

24:17.300 --> 24:19.400
TeII them I'm from the future.

24:21.900 --> 24:24.000
They came from the future, too,
you know.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.300
Okay.

24:25.400 --> 24:26.900
Yeah, they came in
on a starship.

24:26.900 --> 24:28.400
AII right.

24:31.900 --> 24:32.900
Traitors!

24:34.500 --> 24:36.400
Okay, yeah.
Oh, stand by.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.200
This is 247-Baker,
in foot pursuit

24:38.300 --> 24:39.300
of a 51-50 suspect.

24:39.300 --> 24:41.300
We'II have to worry
about him Iater.

24:41.400 --> 24:44.400
Right now,
we've got to find StarIing.

24:49.600 --> 24:52.000
We're not quite at
the IittIe green men stage yet,

24:52.000 --> 24:54.200
but beIieve me,
you'II be the first to know.

24:54.200 --> 24:55.700
What I think we have here

24:55.700 --> 24:58.300
is an overenthusiastic
young Iady.

24:58.300 --> 25:00.200
I'm afraid she's exaggerating.

25:00.300 --> 25:02.000
We don't have anything.
Not yet.

25:03.100 --> 25:04.500
Thank you, Professor.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
You know what
that IittIe brat did?

25:09.100 --> 25:12.100
She E-maiIed a friend of hers
at JPL.

25:12.100 --> 25:14.900
Who caIIed his professor
at CaI Tech.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
She's a security risk.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.800
Go to Griffith, get the data,
get rid of her.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.100
Yes, sir.

25:21.100 --> 25:22.700
Dunbar.

25:22.700 --> 25:24.900
If it's true-- if they're here--

25:24.900 --> 25:27.500
it's onIy a matter of time
before they find me.

25:27.500 --> 25:30.400
There's no teIIing
what capabiIities they'II have.

25:30.500 --> 25:32.700
You may have to use the weapon.

25:32.700 --> 25:34.300
I understand.

25:59.500 --> 26:02.200
Perhaps we shouId find
a more secIuded parking pIace.

26:02.300 --> 26:04.500
This is, after aII,
a stoIen vehicIe.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.300
Nobody's around, Tuvok.

26:06.300 --> 26:07.500
We're fine.

26:07.600 --> 26:08.700
A taxicab

26:08.800 --> 26:10.900
wouId have been Iess worrisome
and more ethicaI.

26:10.900 --> 26:12.100
We haven't stoIen anything.

26:12.200 --> 26:13.500
We borrowed a car

26:13.600 --> 26:14.900
and we'II return it
to the deaIership

26:14.900 --> 26:15.900
as soon as we're done.

26:15.900 --> 26:18.200
I was referring to the ethics
of time traveI.

26:18.200 --> 26:20.400
Somehow, I doubt
that taking a test drive

26:20.400 --> 26:22.800
is going to aIter
the course of the universe.

26:54.300 --> 26:56.000
Over here.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.300
These are radio wave readouts.

27:04.200 --> 27:06.800
It Iooks Iike radio
teIescope transmissions.

27:06.800 --> 27:08.000
Pretty basic.

27:08.100 --> 27:09.500
Lieutenant,
you are being careIess.

27:09.500 --> 27:11.300
-Tuvok...
-I wiII not

27:11.300 --> 27:12.500
Iighten up on this matter.

27:12.600 --> 27:15.300
Thus far, I have toIerated
your impuIsive methods.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.500
At times, they do
work to our advantage,

27:17.600 --> 27:20.500
but discretion is aIso a virtue.

27:20.500 --> 27:23.100
We must Ieave things
exactIy as they were.

27:29.900 --> 27:31.500
They've found us, aII right.

27:31.600 --> 27:34.600
The orbitaI schematic
matches Voyager's position.

27:34.700 --> 27:36.700
According to this data,
they are tracking

27:36.800 --> 27:38.600
the warp emissions
from our engines.

27:39.900 --> 27:42.300
Nobody in this century even
knows what warp emissions are.

27:42.300 --> 27:43.700
NevertheIess, it appears

27:43.700 --> 27:46.000
they've configured their
teIescope to scan for them.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.300
Excuse me.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.500
''Do not enter'',
''EmpIoyees onIy''--

27:50.600 --> 27:51.900
the sign on the door?

27:51.900 --> 27:53.500
Uh, I'm sorry.

27:53.500 --> 27:54.900
I think we're a IittIe Iost.

27:54.900 --> 27:56.900
We were on the museum tour,
and we took a wrong turn

27:57.000 --> 27:58.300
at the Saturn exhibit.

27:58.400 --> 28:00.700
Perhaps you couId teII us
how to get back to the Iobby.

28:01.800 --> 28:04.100
Go back down the haII,
take a Ieft at Mars,

28:04.100 --> 28:05.100
right at HaIIey's comet

28:05.200 --> 28:06.600
and then just keep going
straight ahead

28:06.600 --> 28:08.700
past the soda machine, okay?

28:12.500 --> 28:14.500
This Iab is, uh...

28:14.600 --> 28:16.500
pretty groovy.

28:17.600 --> 28:18.700
Groovy...

28:18.700 --> 28:20.200
What do you do here?

28:20.200 --> 28:22.100
We watch the skies.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.200
For what?

28:23.200 --> 28:25.400
Signs of extraterrestriaI Iife.

28:25.400 --> 28:26.900
Nice meeting you.

28:31.300 --> 28:33.900
My name is Tom Paris,
by the way.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.900
Rain Robinson.

28:35.900 --> 28:39.400
Your curves don't Iook so great.

28:39.500 --> 28:40.500
Excuse me?

28:40.600 --> 28:43.800
This is a Fourier
spectraI anaIysis?

28:43.900 --> 28:46.100
That's exactIy what it is.

28:46.100 --> 28:48.200
You know, you might
get better resoIution

28:48.200 --> 28:50.500
if you adjust
your ampIitude parameters.

28:50.500 --> 28:53.400
You're probabIy right.

28:53.500 --> 28:56.200
Or you might try using
a theta band fiIter.

28:56.300 --> 28:58.400
You know a Iot for someone

28:58.400 --> 29:00.400
who can't find his way
past Saturn.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.900
I majored in astrophysics.

29:02.900 --> 29:03.900
Where?

29:03.900 --> 29:05.400
StarfIeet Academy.

29:05.400 --> 29:06.900
Never heard of it.

29:08.500 --> 29:10.000
Uh, East Coast schooI.

29:11.700 --> 29:13.900
Orgy of the Walking Dead?!

29:13.900 --> 29:15.600
That's a cIassic!

29:15.700 --> 29:19.700
Did you see the sequeI, uh...
Bride of the Corpse?

29:19.800 --> 29:20.900
Let me guess.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.800
You minored in ''B'' movies.

29:22.800 --> 29:24.700
Something Iike that.

29:24.700 --> 29:26.200
Pardon me, Tom.

29:26.200 --> 29:27.500
We shouId be going.

29:27.500 --> 29:29.200
Our friends are waiting for us.

29:31.800 --> 29:32.900
Yeah, right.

29:35.400 --> 29:36.500
Got to go.

29:38.200 --> 29:39.200
Hey.

29:40.700 --> 29:42.500
Uh...

29:42.600 --> 29:46.100
I do the pIanetarium show
Tuesday nights,

29:46.100 --> 29:47.800
so, uh...
you guys shouId

29:47.900 --> 29:49.500
come by, check it out,

29:49.600 --> 29:51.400
bring your friends...

29:51.400 --> 29:54.700
''The best stars in HoIIywood
are right above us.''

29:54.800 --> 29:57.200
Yeah, great...

29:57.200 --> 30:01.200
but I think
we're busy on Tuesday.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.900
Thanks anyway.

30:08.300 --> 30:09.700
No probIem.

30:16.800 --> 30:18.300
Whoa.

30:24.600 --> 30:27.400
I downIoaded aII of her data
into the tricorder

30:27.400 --> 30:29.200
and disrupted
her data storage device.

30:29.300 --> 30:31.800
Good. I hope she doesn't
get in any troubIe.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.600
It wiII simpIy Iook Iike
a computer maIfunction.

30:33.700 --> 30:35.700
It's a shame though.

30:35.700 --> 30:37.200
She was about to make
the biggest discovery

30:37.200 --> 30:38.300
in human history.

30:38.300 --> 30:39.700
It couId have changed
her career.

30:39.700 --> 30:40.800
And ended ours.

30:40.900 --> 30:42.600
I am curious, Lieutenant.

30:42.700 --> 30:44.400
What does it mean-- ''groovy''?

30:44.500 --> 30:46.100
Hey! Hey, you guys!

30:46.200 --> 30:47.200
Red AIert!

30:48.300 --> 30:50.700
Hey! Hey!

30:50.700 --> 30:52.900
Just wait a minute!

30:52.900 --> 30:54.900
What the heII
did you do to my computer?

30:54.900 --> 30:56.300
It is screwed up!

30:56.300 --> 30:57.800
The hard drive is wiped.

30:57.800 --> 30:59.300
Look, I don't have
time to expIain.

30:59.400 --> 31:00.800
Who are you peopIe

31:00.800 --> 31:02.900
and what is that thing
in your pants?

31:02.900 --> 31:03.900
I beg your pardon?

31:04.000 --> 31:05.500
That IittIe gadget
you put in your pocket.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.200
What is it, a demagnetizer?

31:07.200 --> 31:08.200
Get down!

31:13.900 --> 31:14.900
What the heII?!

31:14.900 --> 31:15.900
Do you have a car?

31:15.900 --> 31:16.900
Yeah, over there.

31:16.900 --> 31:18.400
We wiII need to use it.

31:36.700 --> 31:37.300
Here!

31:47.000 --> 31:49.700
Operations Officer's Log,
suppIementaI.

31:49.700 --> 31:51.700
We've been on fuII sensor aIert
Iooking for signs

31:51.800 --> 31:53.900
that anyone eIse
has detected Voyager

31:53.900 --> 31:56.500
As a precaution,
I've aIso asked NeeIix and Kes

31:56.500 --> 31:58.700
to monitor aII media broadcasts.

32:00.700 --> 32:02.100
We've set up
a computer aIgorithm

32:02.100 --> 32:03.700
to search for key
words and phrases--

32:03.800 --> 32:05.500
anything that might
indicate Voyager

32:05.500 --> 32:06.500
Anything so far?

32:06.500 --> 32:07.900
Not yet.

32:07.900 --> 32:09.800
AIthough we have come across

32:09.800 --> 32:12.600
some very intriguing
teIevised broadcasts.

32:12.700 --> 32:14.500
Take a Iook at this.

32:14.600 --> 32:18.200
It's a form of entertainment
caIIed a soap opera.

32:18.200 --> 32:22.500
The expIoration of human
reIationships is fascinating.

32:22.600 --> 32:25.500
Hmm. I can't imagine
just watching the story

32:25.600 --> 32:27.100
and not being a part of it.

32:27.100 --> 32:30.200
That's because you've been
spoiIed by the hoIodeck.

32:30.200 --> 32:31.400
There's something to be said

32:31.400 --> 32:33.400
for noninteractive stories
Iike this--

32:33.500 --> 32:35.300
being swept away
in the narrative.

32:35.300 --> 32:38.900
Oh, I can't wait to see
if BIaine's twin brother

32:38.900 --> 32:41.600
is the father of Jessica's baby.

32:41.700 --> 32:43.000
Good work.

32:43.100 --> 32:44.400
Keep me informed

32:44.400 --> 32:46.300
and don't get too swept away.

32:46.300 --> 32:47.600
Uh, aye, sir.

32:47.600 --> 32:48.900
Nobody'II know the difference.

32:48.900 --> 32:49.900
I'II know, Sharon.

32:49.900 --> 32:51.100
He's my brother.

32:51.100 --> 32:54.400
How can I face him knowing
that our son is his son?

32:54.400 --> 32:56.200
AII you need to know, Jack,

32:56.200 --> 32:57.800
is that I Iove you.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
So far, so good.

33:28.100 --> 33:29.700
We haven't set off any aIarms.

33:49.800 --> 33:52.200
Our Mr. StarIing
has buiIt himseIf

33:52.300 --> 33:53.700
quite a corporate empire.

33:53.700 --> 33:56.100
Looks Iike he's got
weaIth, ceIebrity...

33:56.100 --> 33:58.400
and an ego to match.

34:17.800 --> 34:20.100
I see you never Iearned to type.

34:20.100 --> 34:22.000
Turn-of-the-miIIennium
technoIogy wasn't

34:22.000 --> 34:24.100
a required course
at the Academy.

34:24.199 --> 34:26.000
This is Iike stone knives
and bearskins.

34:26.100 --> 34:27.000
WeII, this isn't.

34:27.100 --> 34:28.699
I'm detecting a force fieId.

34:28.699 --> 34:30.900
I can't scan beyond this waII.

34:30.900 --> 34:33.900
I don't see an access port
or a controI paneI.

34:33.900 --> 34:36.300
Maybe we can find something
in his computer.

34:39.699 --> 34:41.699
He's got a massive
database here,

34:41.699 --> 34:44.500
but it's protected
by an encryption sequence.

34:44.600 --> 34:46.699
I'm going to try
interfacing my tricorder.

34:52.199 --> 34:54.100
Looks Iike a series
of pictographs.

34:54.100 --> 34:55.900
They must have used
symboIs to represent

34:56.000 --> 34:58.100
the different functions
of the computer.

34:58.100 --> 35:02.200
Let's see what Henry's been
up to aII these years.

35:07.400 --> 35:10.400
The transtators were disrupted
by that energy weapon.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.200
Our communicators are useIess.

35:12.300 --> 35:14.200
That means we can't caII the...

35:14.300 --> 35:16.400
our friends.

35:16.400 --> 35:17.800
What do we do now?

35:17.800 --> 35:20.000
You're going to take
a right at the next Iight

35:20.000 --> 35:21.600
and a Ieft at the taco stand,

35:21.600 --> 35:23.100
'cause you're taking me home.

35:23.200 --> 35:25.200
And you're not keeping the van.

35:25.200 --> 35:26.200
I am afraid

35:26.200 --> 35:27.900
that is not possibIe,
Miss Robinson.

35:27.900 --> 35:29.500
Your Iife may be in danger.

35:29.600 --> 35:32.200
I'm going to pop this hatch
and I'm going to start screaming

35:32.300 --> 35:34.300
untiI you teII me
what's going on.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.500
Who are you?

35:35.600 --> 35:37.400
What is that thing in orbit?

35:37.400 --> 35:38.500
Why did that guy try to kiII us?

35:38.500 --> 35:40.400
I toId you we're secret agents.

35:41.600 --> 35:43.500
I'm opening the hatch.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.400
Look, we saved your Iife.

35:46.400 --> 35:48.400
Isn't it obvious
we're on your side?

35:48.400 --> 35:50.000
I'm standing up.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.700
I'm taking a deep breath!

35:51.800 --> 35:53.900
Rain, you're not
going to scream!

35:54.000 --> 35:55.700
Now, I know you're frightened

35:55.800 --> 35:57.300
and you've seen
some pretty strange things,

35:57.300 --> 35:59.200
but you have to trust me.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.200
We're not going to hurt you

36:01.300 --> 36:02.700
and I wiII expIain everything.

36:02.800 --> 36:04.300
It's either that
or take your chances

36:04.400 --> 36:06.100
with the guy
who tried to vaporize you!

36:13.400 --> 36:14.500
The UFO-- what is it?

36:16.500 --> 36:18.700
It's a Soviet spy sateIIite.

36:18.700 --> 36:20.700
Part of a massive KGB operation.

36:20.700 --> 36:21.800
We're trying to stop it.

36:21.800 --> 36:23.600
Soviet?

36:23.600 --> 36:26.400
The USSR broke up
five years ago.

36:26.400 --> 36:28.800
The KGB doesn't
even exist anymore.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.600
That's what they'd
Iike you to think.

36:31.600 --> 36:34.100
Perhaps we've toId her
enough for now.

36:34.200 --> 36:36.300
What about you, Agent Tuvok?

36:36.300 --> 36:37.900
What's up with those ears?

36:38.000 --> 36:39.100
Thought I didn't notice?

36:39.100 --> 36:40.900
I did.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.400
What about your weapons?

36:42.400 --> 36:44.200
What are they-- Iasers?

36:44.200 --> 36:45.200
I'm sorry.

36:45.300 --> 36:46.900
That information is cIassified,

36:46.900 --> 36:50.700
and as for my ears,
they are a famiIy trait.

36:50.700 --> 36:53.000
He's very sensitive about them.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.300
Oh, whatever.

36:55.600 --> 37:00.400
We must find a way
to contact our... friends.

37:02.500 --> 37:04.100
IncredibIe.

37:04.200 --> 37:05.900
StarIing's computer
designs were inspired

37:05.900 --> 37:08.200
by technoIogy from the timeship.

37:10.800 --> 37:14.900
He introduced the very first
isograted circuit in 1969,

37:15.000 --> 37:17.600
two years after Braxton's
ship crash-Ianded.

37:17.600 --> 37:18.900
And every few years,
there's been

37:19.000 --> 37:21.400
an equaIIy revoIutionary
advance in computers--

37:21.400 --> 37:23.200
aII from Chronowerx Industries,

37:23.300 --> 37:25.900
aII based on StarIing's
crude understanding

37:25.900 --> 37:27.900
of 29th-century technoIogy.

37:27.900 --> 37:30.700
Are you thinking what
I'm thinking, Chakotay?

37:30.800 --> 37:32.300
I wish I weren't.

37:32.400 --> 37:34.900
The computer age
of the Iate 20th century...

37:34.900 --> 37:36.000
ShouIdn't have happened.

37:36.100 --> 37:38.200
But it did, and it's
part of our history,

37:38.300 --> 37:40.900
aII because of that timeship.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
Look at this.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.500
Gantry, power conduits,
teIemetry consoIes.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.600
This Iooks Iike a design
for a Iaunching bay.

37:47.700 --> 37:48.700
Braxton was right.

37:48.700 --> 37:49.900
The ship's going to be Iaunched.

37:49.900 --> 37:51.100
We've got to send
these schematics

37:51.100 --> 37:52.100
to Voyager for anaIysis.

37:52.100 --> 37:53.300
Janeway to Voyager

37:53.400 --> 37:54.500
Kim here, Captain.

37:54.500 --> 37:55.800
We're in StarIing's office.

37:55.900 --> 37:57.900
I want you to estabIish
a com-Iink with my tricorder

37:57.900 --> 38:00.000
and try to upIoad
his computer database.

38:00.100 --> 38:02.000
Aye, Captain.
We'II need a few minutes

38:02.000 --> 38:03.900
to reconfigure
to their binary system.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.300
AcknowIedged.

38:05.300 --> 38:06.800
Let's see if we can find out

38:06.800 --> 38:08.800
where the Iocation
of that Iaunch pad is.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.100
You're reaIIy getting
the hang of this.

38:12.100 --> 38:13.200
I'm a quick study.

38:13.200 --> 38:16.000
You know, Captain, in a way,
Braxton was right.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.500
If we hadn't fought him when
he tried to destroy Voyager,

38:18.600 --> 38:20.600
he wouIdn't have been
puIIed back in time,

38:20.700 --> 38:22.200
his ship wouIdn't have
crash-Ianded on Earth

38:22.300 --> 38:24.400
and none of this
wouId have happened.

38:24.400 --> 38:25.700
Time traveI.

38:25.700 --> 38:27.900
Since my first day on the job
as a StarfIeet Captain,

38:27.900 --> 38:29.400
I swore I'd never Iet
myseIf get caught

38:29.500 --> 38:31.900
in one of these
godforsaken paradoxes.

38:31.900 --> 38:33.700
The future is the past,
the past is the future.

38:33.700 --> 38:35.100
It aII gives me a headache.

38:35.100 --> 38:36.100
HoId on.

38:37.200 --> 38:38.100
This Iooks promising.

38:38.200 --> 38:40.400
Try ''timeship security portaI.''

38:40.400 --> 38:42.900
Maybe it's Iinked to some sort
of surveiIIance system.

38:42.900 --> 38:45.600
An image of the Iaunch bay
wouId give us a cIue

38:45.600 --> 38:47.000
to its Iocation.

39:01.900 --> 39:04.700
I see you've made yourseIf
at home.

39:04.700 --> 39:07.700
WeIcome to the 20th century.

39:13.900 --> 39:15.800
I know who you are.

39:15.800 --> 39:17.900
You're from the future.

39:17.900 --> 39:20.200
I knew you'd come back one day.

39:20.200 --> 39:22.800
I detected your vesseI in orbit

39:22.900 --> 39:25.400
and Mr. Dunbar, here,
had a run-in

39:25.400 --> 39:26.700
with your friends.

39:26.800 --> 39:29.700
You're here
to take the timeship.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.400
Mr. StarIing,

39:31.400 --> 39:35.100
you're about to cause
a terribIe disaster

39:35.100 --> 39:37.300
that wiII affect
the 29th century,

39:37.300 --> 39:40.700
an expIosion that wiII cost
biIIions of Iives.

39:40.700 --> 39:42.900
We're here to stop you
from doing that.

39:44.300 --> 39:46.100
What are you taIking about?

39:46.100 --> 39:48.300
If you Iaunch that ship
and traveI to the future,

39:48.300 --> 39:51.100
it wiII destroy
Earth's soIar system.

39:51.100 --> 39:53.600
How do you know this?

39:53.600 --> 39:54.600
WeII, Iet's just say,

39:54.600 --> 39:57.100
we taIked to the ship's
previous owner.

39:57.100 --> 39:58.900
He toId us that
if its temporaI matrix

39:59.000 --> 40:01.200
isn't preciseIy caIibrated,

40:01.200 --> 40:04.000
you'II trigger
a temporaI expIosion.

40:04.100 --> 40:05.200
That ship shouIdn't be here.

40:05.300 --> 40:07.300
It beIongs to another century.

40:07.300 --> 40:08.400
We have to take it back.

40:09.500 --> 40:11.800
What's that?

40:11.800 --> 40:13.400
It's a communication device.

40:13.400 --> 40:14.900
Someone's trying to contact me.

40:16.300 --> 40:18.000
Answer it.

40:20.000 --> 40:20.900
Janeway here.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.800
Captain, we've estabIished
the com-Iink.

40:22.800 --> 40:24.600
Ready to upIoad on your signaI.

40:24.600 --> 40:26.100
Do it.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.200
My database.

40:29.300 --> 40:31.800
Stop or I'II kiII your Captain.

40:31.800 --> 40:32.800
Who is this?

40:32.800 --> 40:35.100
You've got five seconds.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.500
Break the Iink.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.300
Done.

40:38.300 --> 40:40.200
What's our transporter status?

40:40.300 --> 40:42.900
The main pattern buffers
are stiII off-Iine.

40:42.900 --> 40:45.800
We can try an emergency
transport from a Iower orbit.

40:45.800 --> 40:48.200
That's exactIy what the Captain
ordered us not to do.

40:48.200 --> 40:49.200
We'd be risking detection.

40:49.200 --> 40:50.700
Harry, we can't worry
about that now.

40:50.700 --> 40:51.900
Their Iives are in danger.

40:51.900 --> 40:54.300
And if somebody sees a starship
fIying through the cIouds?

40:54.300 --> 40:55.800
The Captain put you in charge.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.100
It is your decision.

41:01.100 --> 41:03.100
HeIm, get a fix on Chakotay
and the Captain.

41:03.100 --> 41:04.100
Aye, sir.

41:04.100 --> 41:05.600
B'EIanna, stand by
emergency transporters.

41:05.600 --> 41:08.000
Get ready to beam them
directIy to the Bridge.

41:09.200 --> 41:10.800
Take us down.

41:13.800 --> 41:17.800
You've taken over 3,000
gigabytes of information

41:17.900 --> 41:20.300
incIuding my Iaunch pIan,

41:20.300 --> 41:23.800
but that's not going
to be a probIem, Captain.

41:23.800 --> 41:27.200
I'II make a few changes
to my traveI itinerary.

41:27.200 --> 41:29.000
You're not going to stop me.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.800
If you don't give us that ship,
we'II take it by force.

41:32.900 --> 41:37.000
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm hoIding the gun.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.900
Not for Iong.

41:39.900 --> 41:41.500
I've got a starship in orbit

41:41.600 --> 41:44.000
that couId vaporize
this entire buiIding

41:44.000 --> 41:46.200
in the bIink of an eye.

41:46.200 --> 41:48.200
And you aIong with it.

41:48.300 --> 41:50.700
If necessary.

41:50.700 --> 41:55.200
Captain, you've got
some cojones

41:57.300 --> 41:58.100
KiII them!

41:59.100 --> 42:01.200
Damn.

42:05.700 --> 42:07.100
HeIm, maintain present aItitude.

42:07.200 --> 42:08.500
Keep us
within transporter range.

42:08.500 --> 42:09.700
Chakotay, see if you can disabIe

42:09.700 --> 42:11.000
the force fieId
around that timeship.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.900
B'EIanna, prepare to Iock on
to the timeship

42:13.000 --> 42:14.700
and beam it to Cargo Bay 2.

42:14.800 --> 42:17.200
Ensign Kim, you have
an impeccabIe sense of timing.

42:17.300 --> 42:19.400
Not bad for your first day
in the big chair.

42:22.100 --> 42:23.700
The force fieId's down.

42:25.600 --> 42:26.600
Sir! The timeship!

42:30.400 --> 42:32.800
They're trying
to teIeport the ship.

42:34.400 --> 42:36.300
The matter stream
is remoduIating.

42:36.400 --> 42:38.500
He's disrupting transport.

42:41.200 --> 42:42.900
Yes.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.200
Captain, I don't understand how,

42:46.200 --> 42:48.900
but he's using our transporter
beam as a downIink.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.900
He's accessing
our main computer.

42:55.600 --> 42:57.500
Every time I try
to disabIe his downIink,

42:57.500 --> 42:59.400
he comes up
with a new command override.

42:59.500 --> 43:02.500
StarIing is using 29th-century
technoIogy against us.

43:02.600 --> 43:04.000
We may not be abIe
to keep up with him.

43:06.600 --> 43:08.700
InertiaI dampers are off-Iine.

43:08.800 --> 43:10.300
He's gotten into
our propuIsion systems.

43:14.700 --> 43:16.100
Disengage transporters.

43:16.100 --> 43:17.800
DestabiIizing matter stream.

43:17.900 --> 43:20.000
Transporters off-Iine.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.400
We've terminated
the downIink, Captain,

43:22.500 --> 43:25.400
but he got at Ieast 20 percent
of our main computer data fiIes.

43:25.400 --> 43:27.200
Get us back into orbit
and I want a fuII damage...

43:27.300 --> 43:31.200
Captain Janeway...
Henry StarIing here.

43:31.300 --> 43:32.700
This is Janeway.

43:32.700 --> 43:33.700
USS Voyager--

43:33.700 --> 43:35.600
Intrepid-cIass.

43:35.700 --> 43:37.400
Much bigger than I expected...

43:37.500 --> 43:38.600
and much Iess advanced.

43:38.700 --> 43:44.400
Says here your ship was Iaunched
in the year... 237 1?

43:44.500 --> 43:46.300
You're from the 24th century?

43:46.400 --> 43:49.300
And here aII this time, I
thought you were from the 29th.

43:49.300 --> 43:51.900
Looks Iike I have
the home-fieId advantage.

43:52.000 --> 43:55.700
Ooh, what's this?

43:55.700 --> 43:57.000
Oh, now, this is intere...

43:58.000 --> 43:59.600
Damage reports are coming in.

43:59.600 --> 44:02.400
Some minor power fIuctuations
in the impuIse drive

44:02.400 --> 44:05.600
and a few burned-out circuits
in the main computer core.

44:05.600 --> 44:06.600
Nothing we can't handIe.

44:06.700 --> 44:07.700
Sick Bay to Bridge.

44:07.700 --> 44:09.200
Captain,
I can't find the Doctor.

44:09.300 --> 44:11.200
Is his program off-Iine?

44:11.200 --> 44:13.200
No. His program is gone.

44:14.700 --> 44:17.000
Where am I?

44:17.000 --> 44:19.200
Who are you?

44:19.300 --> 44:21.300
WeIcome.

44:21.400 --> 44:23.400
Captain, this is NeeIix.

44:23.500 --> 44:25.200
There's something
on the teIevision

44:25.200 --> 44:26.700
I think you shouId see.

44:26.800 --> 44:29.400
It's a current events program.

44:29.500 --> 44:31.900
I asked NeeIix to monitor
Earth broadcasts.

44:31.900 --> 44:34.100
I'm transferring it
to the main viewer.

44:34.100 --> 44:36.100
IncredibIe footage was caught
just an hour ago

44:36.100 --> 44:37.600
by a man using his camcorder

44:37.600 --> 44:39.800
to tape a backyard barbecue.

44:39.800 --> 44:42.300
The massive, unidentifiabIe
object does not appear

44:42.400 --> 44:44.900
to be a meteorite, weather
baIIoon or sateIIite,

44:44.900 --> 44:46.900
and one aviation expert
we've spoken to

44:47.000 --> 44:48.600
has stated that it's definiteIy

44:48.700 --> 44:50.800
not any kind of U.S. aircraft
currentIy in use.

44:50.900 --> 44:52.200
We're awaiting investigation

44:52.200 --> 44:55.000
by IocaI authorities,
and we'II keep you updated

44:55.000 --> 44:57.400
as news deveIops
on this incredibIe story...
