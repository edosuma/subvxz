WEBVTT

00:12.930 --> 00:15.342
Would you leave her alone?

00:15.516 --> 00:18.303
It's your own fault.
You and your insane affection...

00:18.477 --> 00:20.559
-...for stupid cattle.
-Just go away.

00:20.730 --> 00:23.517
I wouldn't have to be here
if the Magister could trust you.

00:23.691 --> 00:29.607
l fulfilled the conditions of my sentence.
I murdered this innocent girl.

00:29.780 --> 00:32.863
There was no murder.
You drained her blood and gave her yours.

00:33.034 --> 00:34.490
l've proven my loyalty.

00:34.660 --> 00:37.618
Yes. But you're romantic,
you're sentimental.

00:37.788 --> 00:42.248
You just might do something to keep
the little bloodbag from joining our ranks.

00:42.418 --> 00:47.082
I'll follow my orders. I won't let you
stake her before she goes to ground.

00:49.634 --> 00:53.297
I'm not gonna stake her,
I'm gonna set her free.

00:53.471 --> 00:58.056
You've already set her free.
The same as Eric freed me.

00:58.226 --> 01:01.309
Everyone she's ever known
will recoil from her.

01:01.479 --> 01:04.061
Everything she's ever loved
has been stolen from her.

01:04.232 --> 01:06.348
Oh, please, there's no comparison.

01:06.525 --> 01:09.232
You've given that
pathetic lump of temporary flesh...

01:09.403 --> 01:12.645
-Jessica.
-...the ultimate gift.

01:12.823 --> 01:16.941
-You're a maker. You're a hero.
-I find myself doubting...

01:17.119 --> 01:21.237
-...whether you were ever truly human.
-Thank you.

01:23.459 --> 01:24.869
Damn you.

01:25.044 --> 01:28.502
Once she's planted in the earth,
the transformation will begin.

01:28.839 --> 01:32.423
-I know.
-|'|| tuck you in.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.921
Tomorrow night...

01:36.347 --> 01:40.465
...your little girl will rise a vampire.

03:18.532 --> 03:18.861
This is Tara.
Leave a message. Easy stuff.

03:18.866 --> 03:22.199
This is Tara.
Leave a message. Easy stuff.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.907
Hey, Tara, where you at?
At least let me know...

03:25.081 --> 03:27.914
...you're not drunk in a ditch somewhere.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.033
I'm sorry, I take it back. Just call, okay?

03:33.255 --> 03:34.870
Hey.

03:35.299 --> 03:38.632
I had to put those clothes in the wash.

03:38.803 --> 03:41.966
It felt like the killer was all over me.

03:42.139 --> 03:43.675
Watching me, hating me...

03:43.849 --> 03:49.469
...itching for a knife
or a rope or my neck.

03:49.647 --> 03:55.017
-You didn't get any sense of who it was?
-No, just pictures.

03:55.194 --> 04:00.530
His thoughts were
all red and black and snarly.

04:01.158 --> 04:02.819
But there was something familiar.

04:02.993 --> 04:07.407
Like somebody from Bon Temps?
Or somebody from the bar?

04:07.581 --> 04:10.323
No one I could recognize for sure.

04:11.627 --> 04:14.869
-Look, I think we should call the police.
-And what would I say?

04:15.047 --> 04:17.584
"Sheriff Dearborne, Andy Bellefleur,
I saw a woman die.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.545
| just happened to be
in somebody else's brain at the time"?

04:20.719 --> 04:23.756
Did you get a good look at her?
I mean, what was she like?

04:23.931 --> 04:27.173
Young, pretty...

04:27.435 --> 04:28.470
...with an apron.

04:28.644 --> 04:32.478
-Apron. You mean like a mom?
-More like a waitress.

04:33.983 --> 04:37.521
Was there a nametag?

04:37.862 --> 04:40.194
-Maybe.
-Yeah.

04:41.490 --> 04:43.446
What did it say?

04:45.870 --> 04:47.610
I don't know.

04:50.166 --> 04:53.158
l was looking at her eyes.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.997
She was so surprised.

04:59.800 --> 05:03.509
Well, do you wanna call Bill?
I mean, that might make you feel better.

05:04.180 --> 05:07.843
No. He would've felt how scared I was.

05:08.017 --> 05:10.804
He would've known I was in danger.

05:10.978 --> 05:14.015
If he didn't show up tonight...

05:14.190 --> 05:18.058
-...he's not coming back.
-Hey.

05:24.241 --> 05:27.904
-You hear from Tara?
-No.

05:35.544 --> 05:39.537
Well, good night.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.165
Night.

06:05.616 --> 06:08.858
-Copy that.
-A woman. At 2 in the morning.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.118
Standing there naked,
fucking with my head.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.449
-And she was with a pig?
-A big pig.

06:13.624 --> 06:17.116
Like, you know, like a crazy-ass
motherfucking Paul Bunyan pig.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.785
-Tara, tell the truth.
-That is the truth.

06:19.964 --> 06:21.454
Kenya, I'm an excellent driver...

06:21.632 --> 06:25.250
...but you can't prepare for a naked lady
and a hog in the middle of the road.

06:25.427 --> 06:28.464
-Now, you know that.
-I know you drunk, that's what I know.

06:28.973 --> 06:31.965
Drunk? I'm not drunk. One beer.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.676
Coming from Arlene's party
with an open bottle.

06:34.853 --> 06:37.105
-What bottle?
-The one busted in your car.

06:37.273 --> 06:38.353
That's not my bottle.

06:38.691 --> 06:41.933
-Then you wouldn't mind a sobriety test.
-Hell, no. Bring it.

06:42.653 --> 06:43.984
Step away from the vehicle.

06:44.780 --> 06:47.988
Stand with your feet together.
Stand with one foot in front...

06:48.158 --> 06:52.948
...holding the other one 6 inches
off the ground, parallel to the ground.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.159
-Let's try that again.
-What is the matter with you?

06:56.333 --> 06:58.745
-You know, you turning into Lettie Mae.
-Fuck you.

06:59.295 --> 07:02.913
I am a sheriff's deputy now.
Tara Thornton, don't you go there with me.

07:04.425 --> 07:09.135
Kenya, sister,
the only place I wanna go is home.

07:10.097 --> 07:13.260
Well, sorry, not tonight.

07:13.434 --> 07:18.519
-No. It's not fair. It's not my fault.
-I will cuff you.

07:18.689 --> 07:21.852
-But the lady and the pig, that was real.
-Yeah.

07:22.026 --> 07:25.018
Just watch your intoxicated head,
please.

07:25.821 --> 07:30.406
Jesus fucking Christ. Shit. Fuck.
Amy, what did you do?

07:30.576 --> 07:33.033
I did what we had to do.
Now, come on, wipe up.

07:33.203 --> 07:36.036
Here's a towel.
There's more rags. Come on.

07:37.833 --> 07:39.073
Who the fuck are you?

07:42.338 --> 07:45.045
How can you say that to me?
You know who I am.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.877
-You know better than anybody.
-I thought I knew.

07:48.052 --> 07:51.010
-I told you to let him go.
-Well, I told you not to talk to him.

07:51.180 --> 07:53.216
-He was controlling your mind.
-Bullshit.

07:53.390 --> 07:54.596
-Yes.
-No, not Eddie.

07:54.767 --> 07:59.056
He didn't know how to do that yet.
He trusted me. It was gonna be all right.

07:59.229 --> 08:02.562
God, it was never gonna be all right.
From the minute we took him...

08:02.733 --> 08:05.395
...you knew it'd end like this.
You just couldn't face it.

08:05.569 --> 08:10.154
-I didn't think it would fucking end like this.
-You wanted his blood, bad.

08:10.324 --> 08:12.440
You were with me the whole way,
so don't act...

08:12.618 --> 08:16.031
...like this is all my fault.
Now, I said to clean up, so clean up.

08:16.205 --> 08:19.743
-Yankee bitch.
-Dumb fucking hillbilly.

08:29.426 --> 08:30.757
God.

08:46.151 --> 08:50.394
Listen. It's okay. It's gonna be all right.
We just gotta keep our shit together.

08:54.576 --> 08:57.909
-We killed a man.
-No.

08:58.080 --> 09:02.494
-Yeah.
-For the last time, he was already dead.

09:02.668 --> 09:03.874
He was not a man.

09:04.044 --> 09:07.707
He was a predator, only we got him first.

09:08.716 --> 09:12.629
So don't do this, okay?
Don't let a vampire come between us.

09:13.971 --> 09:15.632
No. I guess not.

09:16.140 --> 09:20.509
Because what we have, Jason...

09:22.146 --> 09:23.977
...it's beautiful.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.228
Yeah.

09:31.613 --> 09:33.149
Yeah.

09:41.832 --> 09:45.950
Good morning.
I didn't know you were up.

09:46.128 --> 09:49.336
-Eggs and sausage, warm in the oven.
-Oh, thanks.

09:51.508 --> 09:54.420
-You already eat?
-Too busy.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.426
Tara call?

09:56.680 --> 10:00.593
Not yet. Probably still sleeping it off.

10:01.018 --> 10:05.352
I'll tell you what, I am sick and tired
of waiting around to get strangled.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.604
That's not gonna happen while I'm here.

10:07.775 --> 10:11.359
You can't spend 24 hours a day with me
for the rest of my life.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.196
Sure I can.

10:14.990 --> 10:18.198
I wanna find that guy
before he finds me again.

10:18.368 --> 10:21.280
So you're looking up killers
in the yellow pages?

10:21.455 --> 10:23.195
No.

10:23.916 --> 10:25.326
I remembered.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.371
In my sleep, I remembered.

10:29.254 --> 10:30.630
What?

10:31.548 --> 10:35.541
The girl I saw. Her clothes,
the apron, it was a uniform.

10:35.719 --> 10:38.586
She was a waitress and there was a tag.
Her name was Cindy.

10:38.764 --> 10:41.756
And the restaurant name
was something about pies.

10:41.934 --> 10:45.176
Party Pies or Patty Pies.

10:47.564 --> 10:50.351
-Wait, you mean Big Patty's Pie House?
-Yes.

10:50.526 --> 10:54.735
Well, yeah, I know Big Patty's.
lt's off l-49, a ways south, near Bunkie.

10:56.782 --> 10:59.068
You don't have to come with me.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.658
Yeah, I do.

11:01.829 --> 11:04.912
-Come on, eat up, you need your fuel.
-l'm not hungry.

11:05.082 --> 11:08.574
-Don't sass me.
-You're not the boss of me.

11:08.836 --> 11:12.670
-Oh, right, you are.
-Yeah.

11:18.470 --> 11:20.552
Hey, you. Going to work?

11:24.601 --> 11:26.592
Yeah, me too in a second.

11:27.729 --> 11:30.766
Look, I wanted to say I'm really sorry.

11:33.318 --> 11:36.606
We are done with this shit,
do you hear me? Done.

11:37.155 --> 11:38.816
I want every drop out of my house.

11:38.991 --> 11:43.030
And if you don't like it,
you can pack your goddamn bags and go.

11:53.589 --> 11:54.954
Love you.

11:55.132 --> 11:57.123
We caught up with
Senator David Finch...

11:57.301 --> 12:00.634
...speaking to the Marthavi/Ie Order
of Visionary Southern Gentlemen...

12:00.804 --> 12:04.467
...as he embarks on his campaign
for the U. 8. House of Representatives.

12:04.641 --> 12:09.635
-The MOVSG has announced that they are--
-He has what? He didn't tell me that.

12:09.813 --> 12:12.646
Equal rights for vampires?
I don’t think so.

12:13.817 --> 12:16.229
-Many of them are foreign immigrants.
-What the fuck?

12:16.403 --> 12:19.270
Taking our jobs and our women.

12:19.615 --> 12:22.903
And their very blood turns our children...

12:23.076 --> 12:27.240
...into addicts, drug dealers
and homosexuals. No vampire...

12:27.414 --> 12:30.952
...and none of these vampire-loving
deviants deserve any rights at all.

12:31.126 --> 12:33.412
You's a lying-ass motherfucker.

12:33.587 --> 12:36.670
-Two-faced son of a bitch.
-...managed his family’s hardware store.

12:36.840 --> 12:40.674
-Did you hear what he just said?
-I can't listen to politicians. | get a seizure.

12:41.094 --> 12:44.336
Senator Finch will be shaking hands
tonight at the Remington Hotel...

12:44.514 --> 12:47.176
-...in Monroe. And offering--
-That's good to know.

12:47.351 --> 12:52.516
-Can we put it on my home-decor program?
-Senator Finch has increased the intensity--

12:52.689 --> 12:55.806
But look. Just by adding shelves.
This is just plain plywood--

12:55.984 --> 12:59.522
Oh, darling, you looking a little used up.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.986
Jason dragging you into his bullshit?

13:03.700 --> 13:06.237
l have no idea what you mean.

13:06.995 --> 13:09.031
-Right inside.
-Terry?

13:09.206 --> 13:10.787
Yeah.

13:11.083 --> 13:14.826
-Why is everybody telling me lies today?
-I got no idea.

13:15.003 --> 13:19.667
-Look at that, Lafayette, theme shelves.
-Oh, that's pretty, baby.

13:20.217 --> 13:22.629
Would you work for me tonight?

13:24.096 --> 13:27.213
No, ma'am, no, sir.
I don't know any Cindy.

13:27.391 --> 13:31.225
But I can recommend the fried apple pie,
the frozen Hawaiian pie...

13:31.395 --> 13:36.059
...the chocolate pecan praline pie,
the chess pie, the seven-layer Jell-O pie.

13:36.233 --> 13:41.444
They'll have the peanut butter pie and
the Spunky Hollow honey pineapple pie.

13:41.613 --> 13:43.729
-Please, Harley.
-Gotcha, Buster.

13:43.907 --> 13:46.899
-We will?
-You won't get nothing from her.

13:47.077 --> 13:49.693
She's only been here two weeks.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.415
Comes from three generations
of dumb as rocks.

13:52.582 --> 13:56.575
-Hell, they named her after a motorcycle.
-That's real interesting, but--

13:56.753 --> 14:00.211
If you wanna know anything
about Cindy Marshall, I'll talk to you.

14:00.382 --> 14:03.749
And I'll eat that pie too. Buster Boisseau.

14:03.927 --> 14:06.589
Sookie Stackhouse, Sam Merlotte.

14:06.763 --> 14:10.381
-Yeah. Can you tell us--?
-First things first.

14:12.477 --> 14:16.265
-You knew Cindy?
-A little bit.

14:16.440 --> 14:21.685
Let's see, I met her two years ago.
She moved into town with her brother...

14:21.862 --> 14:24.274
...a couple of months before....

14:25.615 --> 14:26.900
Before what?

14:28.118 --> 14:32.361
Well, I hate to be the one to tell you,
but somebody murdered that little gal.

14:32.956 --> 14:35.868
-Just choked the life right out of her.
-Poor thing.

14:36.043 --> 14:39.410
-Did they find out who did it?
-Nope. It's a mystery.

14:39.588 --> 14:43.331
-Where's her brother? Could we talk to him?
-Don't know how.

14:43.508 --> 14:46.215
He was gone
by the time they found her body.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.628
The police thought maybe he's dead too
or maybe he killed her.

14:49.806 --> 14:52.593
But there wasn't no evidence
one way or the other.

14:54.644 --> 14:57.477
-What was his name?
-Let me think on that.

14:58.190 --> 15:00.351
Nobody hardly knew him.

15:00.525 --> 15:05.360
Let's see, D something. Dave.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.111
Drew. No, Drew. Drew Marshall.

15:08.533 --> 15:13.197
-What was Cindy like?
-Oh, cute as a button, a little wild...

15:13.371 --> 15:16.499
...fun-loving, always nice to me.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.286
But people talked, you know.

15:20.170 --> 15:21.660
Talked about what?

15:23.590 --> 15:24.955
Vampires.

15:25.133 --> 15:28.751
They say she was carrying on
with the vampires. I didn't believe her.

15:28.929 --> 15:31.887
I mean, what kind of woman
would do such a thing?

15:33.058 --> 15:37.893
Harley, this is the
Texas Special Sawdust pie.

15:38.063 --> 15:40.349
Nobody ordered that.

15:40.524 --> 15:43.812
-Well, it's not much.
-We got a name.

15:43.985 --> 15:46.271
Mama, please don't cry.

15:46.446 --> 15:50.610
It was only a little accident
and I didn't get hurt much.

15:50.784 --> 15:54.197
Well, no, I wasn't drunk,
but they think l was.

15:54.371 --> 15:59.081
Mama, quit yelling. All I need
is bail money and a ride home.

15:59.251 --> 16:01.993
There's no reason to cry.

16:03.672 --> 16:07.836
What do you mean, no? Y'all pussies?
Let's go pound some beers.

16:08.009 --> 16:12.594
Can't. Mama's night blind and I gotta
take her to a baby shower in Shreveport.

16:12.764 --> 16:16.757
Night blind, my ass. She's got those apron
strings wrapped around your throat, boy.

16:16.935 --> 16:20.018
Cut her loose.
Come party with the menfolk.

16:20.188 --> 16:21.769
I wanna go, Jay.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.397
What you gonna do
at a little baby shower?

16:25.235 --> 16:30.070
The food's good, the games are fun.
You know, like Pass the Orange?

16:30.240 --> 16:35.234
And if the ladies start screaming like they
always do, I'll just go for a little walk.

16:35.871 --> 16:38.237
Well, that's just plain sad.

16:39.249 --> 16:41.581
lt's you and me, brother.

16:41.751 --> 16:44.584
We'll play some pool,
I'll buy you a po'boy.

16:44.754 --> 16:48.246
Sorry. Me and Arlene,
we got a date to dance.

16:48.425 --> 16:50.916
-Well, I'll come with you.
-You won't.

16:51.094 --> 16:53.676
It's a date, I said. Me and my woman.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.388
All right, fine.

16:56.558 --> 16:59.174
Fuck it. I'll party on my own.

16:59.352 --> 17:02.719
What do you want with us when you got
Amy? God, she's good-looking.

17:07.360 --> 17:11.444
Well, I'm gonna tell you something,
but you can't say nothing to nobody.

17:11.615 --> 17:13.571
You got that?

17:16.703 --> 17:18.694
Amy likes V.

17:19.331 --> 17:22.619
Vampire blood? No, I don't believe that.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.453
-|t's not a joke?
-Nope.

17:24.628 --> 17:27.916
Then you gotta help her stop.
That's it. Set her straight.

17:28.089 --> 17:31.832
I'm trying, you know,
but she's hooked or something.

17:32.010 --> 17:34.126
There's only so much I can do.

17:34.304 --> 17:37.011
-She sleep with vampires too?
-She says she never did.

17:37.182 --> 17:40.720
But these days, it's hard to
find a woman who ain't been bit.

17:41.978 --> 17:43.639
Do you love her?

17:44.481 --> 17:49.521
Yeah, but I don't like this V shit.

17:51.029 --> 17:54.021
We had a terrible fight.

17:54.532 --> 17:57.695
She might be gone already,
and if she's not...

17:58.995 --> 18:03.159
-...maybe I ought to dump her.
-Man, don't do that.

18:03.333 --> 18:06.917
-She's the kind that you keep.
-Look”.

18:07.087 --> 18:09.749
...you didn't even try to work it out yet.

18:10.507 --> 18:14.967
So tomorrow night, we go out,
get drunk, pass a good time.

18:15.136 --> 18:17.172
We'll figure out what to do.

18:17.639 --> 18:19.675
Yeah, that makes sense.

18:20.350 --> 18:22.591
-Thanks.
-Okay.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.807
-Hang in there, bro.
-All right.

18:27.732 --> 18:30.940
Okay. These things, they got
a way of working out, you know?

18:31.111 --> 18:32.817
I hope you're right.

18:32.988 --> 18:36.321
-All right. Night.
-Night.

18:43.707 --> 18:46.369
-Hello?
-Hold your horses.

18:46.543 --> 18:50.331
Can’t call it adultery
if a wife won 't have sex.

18:50.505 --> 18:52.006
At least Debbie 's a Christian.

18:52.382 --> 18:54.543
Give him a second.
He doesn't think so quick.

18:55.010 --> 18:58.218
-Hello?
-Yeah.

18:58.388 --> 19:02.222
Hello, officer.
Sir. I'm sorry to bother you.

19:03.310 --> 19:05.972
No bother. No bother at all. l was just--

19:06.146 --> 19:09.058
Tom’s coming up to that T.C.
on Terra Ridge, about 5 miles out.

19:09.232 --> 19:10.642
Are those vampire bites?

19:13.236 --> 19:16.148
With all due respect, sir,
that's none of your business.

19:17.240 --> 19:20.073
Sir, we're looking for information.

19:20.243 --> 19:23.030
Well, that's what the library's for.

19:24.331 --> 19:27.323
Wait a minute.
She hasn't even asked you nothing yet.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.912
-|t's about Cindy Marshall's murder.
-What about it?

19:31.046 --> 19:34.288
Well, there have been murders like hers
in Renard Parish.

19:34.466 --> 19:37.879
-Bon Temps, to be exact. Hadn't you heard?
-Can't say.

19:38.053 --> 19:41.420
-She had a brother, Drew, l was told.
-Could be.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.759
Do you have a picture of him?

19:44.768 --> 19:46.429
What for?

19:46.603 --> 19:51.597
We don't know he did it.
More likely a vampire.

19:51.775 --> 19:56.109
I don't mean to tell you your business,
but a vampire wouldn't kill by strangulation.

19:56.279 --> 19:58.611
Well, I guess you'd know.

19:58.782 --> 20:02.195
Good riddance to white trash
is all I got to say.

20:02.369 --> 20:05.452
-Buddy, you're out of line.
-He can say whatever he wants.

20:05.622 --> 20:07.453
It doesn't bother me a bit.

20:07.624 --> 20:11.208
Just hand me a picture of Drew Marshall
and I'll go away quiet.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.460
Well, that file's in storage.

20:13.630 --> 20:16.292
It's gonna take a while to get it,
probably months.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.291
Come on, Sookie,
he's not gonna do shit for us.

20:19.469 --> 20:23.462
Oh, I think he will.
All right, then, we'll go to the library...

20:23.640 --> 20:27.428
...and I'll get your home address. Shouldn't
be too hard to track down your wife.

20:28.019 --> 20:29.850
-My wife?
-So I can tell her...

20:30.021 --> 20:31.557
...you're sleeping with Debbie.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.767
-Yeah, Debbie.
-From church?

20:34.275 --> 20:35.310
You-- How did--?

20:35.485 --> 20:39.148
And the Vampire League of America
will surely wanna know about your attitude.

20:39.906 --> 20:44.491
Now, now, hold on a minute now.
Hold on now.

20:44.994 --> 20:48.077
l can'tjust give you the photo.

20:49.624 --> 20:55.620
What I might could do is tax it on down
to the sheriff in Bon Temps.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.708
Fast.

20:58.341 --> 21:01.583
-Yeah. Do my best.
-That's all we ask.

21:01.761 --> 21:05.219
Thank you so much for your cooperation.

21:05.515 --> 21:06.504
My pleasure.

21:07.851 --> 21:11.343
Lurlene Butterman.
You know, I cannot wait to vote for you.

21:11.521 --> 21:13.477
Well, bless your heart, Lurlene.

21:13.648 --> 21:16.981
And, you know, I cannot wait
to represent your views in Congress.

21:17.152 --> 21:19.689
-Thanks for coming by.
-I would also like to say--

21:19.863 --> 21:24.857
Move ahead, young woman.
The senator got many admirers.

21:25.910 --> 21:28.697
-Hello.
-Hello.

21:28.872 --> 21:33.286
I am so happy and proud to shake the hand
of someone with your values.

21:35.712 --> 21:41.002
Too often we're governed by criminals
and hypocrites, don't you agree?

21:42.719 --> 21:46.587
But I can tell you're a man of virtues.
And I applaud the effort you're making...

21:46.764 --> 21:49.380
...against the poor and disenfranchised...

21:49.559 --> 21:52.676
...especially the vampires and the gays.

21:52.854 --> 21:54.719
Thank you. Next.

21:54.898 --> 21:57.731
So many things can happen...

21:57.901 --> 22:01.189
...to bring down
a fine personage such as yourself.

22:02.238 --> 22:07.028
-You might wanna be careful, you hear?
-Yes.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.488
-Look at the camera.
-No.

22:14.542 --> 22:16.533
Thanks for coming by.

22:27.597 --> 22:29.679
Did you have to work late?

22:31.809 --> 22:35.597
-It doesn't matter. ljust--
-No.

22:35.772 --> 22:37.228
No?

22:39.275 --> 22:41.436
I didn't wanna come home.

22:44.531 --> 22:45.611
Okay.

22:46.866 --> 22:50.108
l was afraid you might have left.

22:52.288 --> 22:55.872
No. No, this is where I wanna be.
I wanna be with you.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.454
-But you can't stay if--
-I did what you said.

22:58.628 --> 23:01.461
It was all my fault, Jason.
I'm so, so sorry.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.386
Did you make dinner for me?

23:15.645 --> 23:17.931
I'd do anything for you.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.683
Come here.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.573
I'll make it right.

24:08.740 --> 24:10.025
Help me.

24:25.506 --> 24:28.919
Why's the way home always longer
than the way there?

24:29.093 --> 24:31.209
Now that'd be philosophy
and I'm a simple guy.

24:31.387 --> 24:34.845
What a load of horse pucky.
Simple is one thing that you are not.

24:35.016 --> 24:37.928
I disagree. I may be a shape-shifter...

24:38.102 --> 24:40.844
...but I want what every man wants.

24:41.022 --> 24:45.265
You know? A good life, a good woman.

24:48.738 --> 24:50.569
Do you love Tara?

24:54.744 --> 24:57.611
You know, I like her a lot...

24:57.789 --> 25:00.701
...and I care about her, for sure.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.830
I've been trying to love her,
but she don't make it easy.

25:05.004 --> 25:07.746
Well, she can't help it.
When you've never had much love--

25:07.924 --> 25:10.165
Oh, I know. I know. Believe me, I know.

25:11.761 --> 25:15.925
But it's-- It's not working.

25:16.099 --> 25:18.465
You know, we're friends, is all.

25:20.061 --> 25:22.848
I mean, I'm not so easy to love either.

25:23.648 --> 25:24.979
You're wrong.

25:26.609 --> 25:28.395
I am?

25:37.620 --> 25:38.951
Do you love Bill?

25:45.294 --> 25:46.909
I think I do.

25:47.797 --> 25:49.287
But...

25:50.174 --> 25:52.165
...where is he?

25:53.720 --> 25:57.463
lf vampire politics
are more important to him than me....

25:59.392 --> 26:01.303
I don't know.

26:03.604 --> 26:07.313
-l'm so mad at him, I could spit.
-I can see where you would be.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.934
I'm sorry you're having to drive so far.

26:14.407 --> 26:16.819
I don't mind. I love to ride in the car.

26:19.203 --> 26:21.489
Of course you do.

26:21.664 --> 26:24.326
Go on, hang your head
out the window if you feel like it.

26:24.500 --> 26:28.288
Okay, I appreciate that
but it's a private pleasure.

26:31.966 --> 26:35.834
One day when all this is over,
I'm gonna save up.

26:36.012 --> 26:39.004
We'll rent a convertible,
we'll take it to the gulf.

26:39.182 --> 26:43.642
-Lie on the beach, bake in the sun.
-|t's a date.

26:53.237 --> 26:55.193
Do you know any car songs?

26:59.076 --> 27:01.692
Damn, woman.
Where'd you learn to cook like that?

27:01.871 --> 27:04.203
From the maid. She was French.

27:04.373 --> 27:07.240
Hey, if I show you something...

27:07.418 --> 27:10.455
...you have to promise
that you're not gonna get mad.

27:10.630 --> 27:12.791
I'm never getting mad at you again,
never ever.

27:12.965 --> 27:15.957
-Promise?
-Yeah, I promise.

27:16.719 --> 27:18.801
I saved one drop.

27:20.723 --> 27:24.966
-Motherfucker!
-Babe, please don't flip.

27:27.188 --> 27:30.305
We both know that we're for real.
We're gonna have a life together.

27:30.942 --> 27:32.773
So, what are you doing with that?

27:33.236 --> 27:35.522
You're killing me.
I can't trust you for a second.

27:35.696 --> 27:40.406
You can trust me totally, for always,
I swear. It's just that I want symmetry.

27:40.576 --> 27:44.114
-Now, what the fuck is that?
-Balance, harmony, beauty.

27:44.288 --> 27:45.494
Oh, for crying out loud.

27:45.665 --> 27:50.079
Baby, this vial is our past. We started
with V so we should end it with V.

27:50.253 --> 27:55.543
Like just closing a circle. So we can
start a new circle, our new life together.

27:55.716 --> 27:59.254
I'm through with the blood.
It's only a symbol.

27:59.428 --> 28:03.592
But the circle, I mean,
that's what's important to me.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.935
Never mind.

28:14.735 --> 28:16.271
I'm gonna go by myself.

28:17.280 --> 28:19.362
Well, I'm not gonna let you do that.

28:21.951 --> 28:25.614
-But this is the last fucking time.
-Last time.

28:31.878 --> 28:33.789
Cheers to our future, baby.

28:46.517 --> 28:50.055
You drank from me.
Your blood was replaced with mine...

28:51.063 --> 28:54.806
...and then I shared my essence with you
when we slept together in the ground.

28:54.984 --> 28:57.475
No, no, no, not intercourse.

28:57.653 --> 29:00.030
You just said "intercourse."

29:00.197 --> 29:04.315
lt's tradition, it's part of the process.
It's magical.

29:04.493 --> 29:06.620
Even we don't fully understand
how it works.

29:06.787 --> 29:09.324
Well, all I know is,
staying out all night like this...

29:09.498 --> 29:12.990
...my daddy's gonna whup you good.
Mister, you better get me home right now.

29:13.169 --> 29:14.705
-Jessica, stop.
-No.

29:14.879 --> 29:16.085
Stop.

29:16.839 --> 29:18.454
Hey.

29:18.925 --> 29:20.665
-Why?
-Because we need to talk.

29:20.843 --> 29:22.674
-Why?
-There are things you must learn.

29:22.845 --> 29:24.585
-Why?
-Because you're no longer human.

29:24.972 --> 29:26.007
-Why?
-As I've been...

29:26.182 --> 29:29.800
...trying to explain to you at length,
you have been made vampire.

29:32.396 --> 29:36.264
-Why?
-Because you were unlucky.

29:37.026 --> 29:39.813
Because life and death are unfair.

29:43.157 --> 29:44.863
Because of me.

29:48.829 --> 29:51.161
You cannot go home.

29:52.875 --> 29:54.831
That part of your life is over.

29:56.879 --> 29:59.370
No more Mama and Daddy?

30:00.591 --> 30:02.673
No more little sister?

30:05.179 --> 30:06.965
I'm sorry.

30:07.390 --> 30:08.800
No.

30:09.392 --> 30:11.348
No more belts.

30:11.936 --> 30:13.642
No more clarinets.

30:13.813 --> 30:16.304
No more home school.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.689
No more rules.

30:22.029 --> 30:24.406
I'm a vampire.

30:25.533 --> 30:28.115
No, no, no. There are rules.

30:32.873 --> 30:34.738
I can say anything I want now.

30:34.917 --> 30:39.035
Shit, shit, shit, damn, hell, fuck.

30:39.213 --> 30:42.080
Oh, "fuck," that's a bad one.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

30:42.258 --> 30:44.499
Oh, what's another cussword
so I can say it?

30:44.677 --> 30:46.417
I'm a damn vampire.

30:46.595 --> 30:49.587
If you calm down, I will teach you
what being a vampire means.

30:49.765 --> 30:52.757
I'm not stupid, I can read.
I know what it means.

30:52.935 --> 30:54.846
Very well, then, why don't you tell me?

30:55.021 --> 30:58.309
It means that I don't
have to sit like a lady...

30:58.482 --> 31:00.643
...and I can kill anybody I want.

31:00.818 --> 31:04.026
And there's an awful lot of people
I'd like to kill.

31:04.196 --> 31:07.905
No, Jessica, you absolutely
cannot kill anybody you want.

31:08.075 --> 31:10.782
But why? Why? I wanna kill them.

31:10.953 --> 31:14.445
With your new powers
come new responsibilities.

31:14.623 --> 31:17.114
You are gonna mainstream, like I do.

31:17.293 --> 31:21.377
You can live almost exactly
the same life as you did before...

31:21.547 --> 31:23.162
...except you'll be awake at night.

31:23.340 --> 31:25.922
I wanna kill people. And I'm so hungry.

31:26.093 --> 31:29.426
And all you do is talk and I'm starving,
and you're so mean.

31:29.597 --> 31:32.259
You're supposed to take care of me,
that's what you said.

31:32.433 --> 31:34.389
You suck!

31:36.395 --> 31:39.137
That's funny because you do suck.

31:40.191 --> 31:43.558
Here, drink this.
It might make you feel more steady.

31:43.736 --> 31:44.816
lhope.

31:45.780 --> 31:48.146
Oh, it tastes like shit.

31:48.324 --> 31:50.485
Why are you doing this to me?

31:50.659 --> 31:53.651
It's not bad. You'll get used to it.
Try a little more.

31:53.829 --> 31:57.162
Fuck, no, and you can't force me.
I'll report you.

31:57.333 --> 31:58.743
Oh, really. To whom?

31:58.918 --> 32:02.581
I'll find a real vampire
and he'll kick your ass.

32:03.714 --> 32:07.127
You won't let me do anything
and I'm so hungry.

32:08.010 --> 32:11.753
You are the worst maker ever.

32:18.687 --> 32:21.178
Tara, visitor.

32:23.025 --> 32:24.105
Mama.

32:24.276 --> 32:26.483
Oh, child.

32:28.697 --> 32:31.188
You're looking good, Lettie Mae.

32:31.367 --> 32:33.483
Whatever you're doing, keep it up.

32:33.661 --> 32:36.152
Thank you, Kenya. That's sweet.

32:39.166 --> 32:41.202
Could you leave us alone for a minute?

32:41.377 --> 32:43.117
Oh, yes, ma'am.

32:43.295 --> 32:46.253
What are you saying? Hey. Hey.

32:46.423 --> 32:48.630
Hey, get back here and let me out.

32:48.801 --> 32:51.668
Who the fuck does she think she is?
What took you so long?

32:51.846 --> 32:54.713
I called Mabel from church
and she came over to pray with me.

32:54.890 --> 32:57.302
Pray? While I'm locked up waiting?

32:57.476 --> 33:00.058
That is bullshit.
Y'all can pray after you post my bail.

33:00.229 --> 33:02.561
Honey, I'm not here to bail you out.

33:03.983 --> 33:07.817
Mama, I'm tired. I hurt all over.
I wanna go home. Don't play with me.

33:07.987 --> 33:10.319
-l'm not playing.
-Yes, you are. You gotta be.

33:10.489 --> 33:14.073
Seeing you like this, it breaks my heart.

33:15.077 --> 33:17.489
How many nights
have I spent in this place?

33:17.663 --> 33:20.826
Crazy with liquor,
lost to myself and the Lord.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.992
-Not many, because I bailed you out.
-We||...

33:25.171 --> 33:28.504
-...maybe you shouldn't have.
-What the fuck are you talking about?

33:29.758 --> 33:32.841
You can't come home.
I'm not gonna let you.

33:34.180 --> 33:36.546
You're changing
right in front of my eyes...

33:36.724 --> 33:38.965
...and I'm scared for both of us.

33:39.143 --> 33:41.099
I don't believe this.

33:42.688 --> 33:46.522
I am committed to salvation
and you're on the road to hell.

33:47.151 --> 33:51.190
I would save you if I could, baby.
Nobody loves you more.

33:52.823 --> 33:55.030
But you're a danger to my soul...

33:55.201 --> 33:57.442
...and I can't have you in my house.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.623
I'm the only reason you have a house.

34:03.292 --> 34:05.658
After all the times I cleaned you up.

34:05.836 --> 34:09.078
All the times you beat me
and stole my money.

34:09.715 --> 34:12.081
Then sent me to school.

34:12.426 --> 34:13.962
Dirty.

34:14.136 --> 34:16.673
In dirty clothes.

34:16.847 --> 34:19.634
So people laughed at me
and called me names.

34:19.808 --> 34:21.799
My whole life is shit because of you.

34:23.229 --> 34:25.641
I know. I know.

34:25.814 --> 34:28.271
Don't tear me up like this. I feel so bad.

34:28.817 --> 34:31.149
The first time I'm in trouble
you turn your back...

34:31.320 --> 34:34.733
...on the one person
who's always stood by you.

34:34.907 --> 34:37.193
And you call yourself a Christian.

34:37.368 --> 34:40.860
I'm finally doing right by you, Tara,
like a mother should.

34:41.038 --> 34:43.404
You'll see that
when the clouds roll away.

34:44.041 --> 34:45.656
Fuck you.

34:45.834 --> 34:47.745
You're not my mother.

34:48.712 --> 34:52.125
Get out of my sight, you evil bitch.

34:57.596 --> 34:58.836
I love you.

34:59.181 --> 35:01.263
No, you don't.

35:03.185 --> 35:05.016
You never did.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.176
Baby.

37:55.023 --> 37:56.979
Earthquake.

38:00.904 --> 38:02.360
Hey.

38:03.699 --> 38:05.405
Did you feel--?

38:16.003 --> 38:17.618
No.

38:24.428 --> 38:26.043
No.

38:28.765 --> 38:30.346
No.

38:32.728 --> 38:36.346
Please. Please, no.

39:15.604 --> 39:18.767
911. What's your emergency?

39:18.941 --> 39:21.023
Yeah. This is Jason Stackhouse.

39:21.193 --> 39:23.605
Oh, hey, Jason. It's Rosie.

39:23.779 --> 39:26.111
You all better come out here.

39:27.616 --> 39:29.948
This is your punishment, not mine.

39:30.118 --> 39:34.578
-What am I supposed to do with her?
-Excuse me. I can hear you, Mr. Rude.

39:38.460 --> 39:41.543
-Oh, I'm hungry.
-She won't listen to me.

39:41.713 --> 39:44.295
It'll take more time than I have
to teach her obedience.

39:44.466 --> 39:47.424
I don't obey anybody.
Those days are over.

39:47.594 --> 39:50.176
You can't handle one little girl, Bill?

39:50.347 --> 39:52.804
Newborns can be like this.

39:53.475 --> 39:55.636
Man up, my friend.
She's not even one night old.

39:55.811 --> 39:59.770
-That is not the issue.
-Want to stay with your maker, don't you?

40:00.148 --> 40:03.231
No, he's a dick. Dick, dick, dick.

40:05.821 --> 40:07.482
You're cute.

40:07.656 --> 40:09.567
Can I sit in your lap?

40:09.741 --> 40:12.027
-No.
-Why?

40:12.786 --> 40:15.152
Nobody lets me have any fun. Fuckers.

40:15.330 --> 40:17.286
Sit down and shut up.

40:19.668 --> 40:21.408
Close the door.

40:24.798 --> 40:27.585
You have to be tough with them
or they'll walk all over you.

40:27.759 --> 40:30.375
I am well aware of that,
but you can see how she is.

40:30.554 --> 40:32.966
And there are urgent matters
to which I must attend.

40:33.140 --> 40:35.301
Sookie Stackhouse?

40:35.892 --> 40:38.053
Haven't you done enough for her?

40:38.604 --> 40:42.392
If any harm were to come to her
because of my absence, you would be--

40:44.818 --> 40:46.354
What?

40:47.362 --> 40:49.478
--without her helpful skills.

40:51.074 --> 40:54.407
Let me out. I wanna do something bad.

40:55.370 --> 40:57.531
I would be in your debt.

40:58.165 --> 40:59.530
I would return the favor.

40:59.708 --> 41:01.369
Oh, yes, you will.

41:01.835 --> 41:04.793
You most definitely will.

41:06.506 --> 41:09.122
-Jessica.
-You don't have to yell at me.

41:10.052 --> 41:13.715
How would you like to learn
how a real vampire feeds?

41:15.182 --> 41:18.891
Oh, yes, sir. Please, sir.

41:19.227 --> 41:20.888
See?

41:21.063 --> 41:22.473
It's really quite easy.

41:28.111 --> 41:30.067
Tara, wake up.

41:30.322 --> 41:32.904
This lady paid your bail.
You're free to go.

41:34.326 --> 41:37.068
Straighten up. I don't wanna
see you back in here again.

41:40.415 --> 41:43.748
My shift's over in five minutes.
There's papers to sign...

41:43.919 --> 41:47.252
-...on the way out. You know the drill.
-Thank you, Kenya.

41:50.842 --> 41:51.922
Who are you?

41:52.969 --> 41:55.346
Why'd you pay my bail?

41:56.098 --> 41:58.214
My name's Maryann.

41:58.433 --> 42:00.094
Forrester.

42:00.394 --> 42:02.680
And I'd like to help you, if you'll let me.

42:03.689 --> 42:06.431
What are you,
some kind of social worker?

42:06.650 --> 42:08.811
Yeah, that's about right.

42:08.985 --> 42:13.149
Kenya knows me. I'm in and out of here
all the time with people in your position.

42:13.323 --> 42:14.938
My position.

42:15.117 --> 42:18.905
DUIs, minor assaults,
public drunkenness.

42:19.746 --> 42:23.580
You know, those times
when things go just a little too far.

42:26.253 --> 42:29.290
It can happen to anyone.

42:30.048 --> 42:31.754
Now, I expect you have your reasons?

42:34.845 --> 42:38.053
Yeah. I got reasons.

42:38.640 --> 42:41.302
Well, I would be very happy
to give you a ride home.

42:42.477 --> 42:44.342
No, thanks.

42:44.813 --> 42:48.351
Well, they gave me your address.

42:48.525 --> 42:52.609
-You can't walk there, it's too far.
-I can....

42:56.825 --> 42:59.817
-I got kicked out.
-You don't have anywhere to go?

43:02.205 --> 43:04.457
No family? No friends?

43:04.624 --> 43:07.616
I don't want them to see me like this.

43:08.587 --> 43:10.293
It's okay.

43:11.006 --> 43:12.997
I'll think of something.

43:13.175 --> 43:14.915
Tara...

43:16.470 --> 43:19.883
...I'm sure you've barely slept or eaten.

43:23.643 --> 43:26.100
Just till you get things figured out.

43:26.521 --> 43:28.477
I don't know, I....

43:28.982 --> 43:32.395
Oh, no, no, there's plenty of room.
I do this all the time.

43:32.569 --> 43:35.106
It's sort of an informal halfway house.

43:35.906 --> 43:37.646
Doesn't seem right.

43:37.824 --> 43:41.942
I know what you mean. But you can
shower, you can wash your clothes.

43:42.120 --> 43:44.202
You can let me feed you.

43:44.372 --> 43:48.536
Then you can go on your way
and my conscience will be clear.

43:49.836 --> 43:53.920
-You're not a Jesus person, are you?
-No.

43:54.549 --> 44:00.044
No. Nothing against religion,
but not a Jesus person.

44:07.729 --> 44:09.390
Okay.

44:12.484 --> 44:13.769
Well...

44:14.903 --> 44:18.771
...here's my card,
in case you change your mind.

44:20.951 --> 44:22.737
Good luck, Tara.

44:27.916 --> 44:29.372
Wait.

44:40.387 --> 44:42.924
Holy shit. What the hell
kind of social worker are you?

44:43.098 --> 44:46.590
Actually, it was a gift. Go on, climb in.

44:48.895 --> 44:50.931
-What's the matter?
-I'm all dirty.

44:51.106 --> 44:53.939
Oh, don't worry about that.
I get dirty too.

44:55.944 --> 44:57.650
Get that car out of here.

44:57.821 --> 45:00.437
This is an official vehicle zone.
Read the fucking sign.

45:00.615 --> 45:03.357
Detective Bellefleur, is it?

45:03.535 --> 45:07.119
Move the car. Jesus Christ, you deaf?

45:07.747 --> 45:09.783
I'm surrounded by assholes and morons.

45:29.686 --> 45:35.647
It sounds strange under the circumstances,
but I had a good time today.

45:35.817 --> 45:37.557
It's the company.

45:37.736 --> 45:39.442
Must be.

45:40.322 --> 45:42.654
I mean, that says something for us.

45:42.824 --> 45:46.442
We can enjoy ourselves even when
we're trying to find a murderer.

45:47.329 --> 45:51.538
You are fun. It's one of the reasons
I'm still working for you.

45:51.708 --> 45:54.996
-Yeah?
-|t's not the tips or the high-class clientele.

45:56.963 --> 45:58.499
You know what?

45:59.841 --> 46:02.833
It was probably the best day of my life...

46:03.303 --> 46:05.885
...when you walked in looking for a job.

46:06.056 --> 46:08.593
-Quit.
-No, I mean it.

46:13.355 --> 46:15.095
I know you do.

46:17.192 --> 46:19.399
Are you looking in my head?

46:20.779 --> 46:22.690
I'm looking in your heart.

46:40.548 --> 46:41.833
Stop!

46:47.055 --> 46:48.591
No! Bill!

46:52.143 --> 46:55.226
Stop fighting, you stupid men!

46:56.064 --> 46:58.680
-He had his hands all over you.
-She's not your property.

46:58.858 --> 47:02.396
Sam, I can speak for myself. You left me
alone with no promise to come back.

47:02.570 --> 47:05.528
Then you attack the man helping
keep me safe. How dare you?

47:05.699 --> 47:08.566
-He's helping because I asked him to.
-Get out!

47:12.247 --> 47:14.909
If you knew what I had done
to return to you....

47:15.375 --> 47:17.957
I rescind your invitation.

47:19.587 --> 47:21.202
Sookie, don't.

47:21.589 --> 47:23.090
Please.

47:25.343 --> 47:26.924
SooMe.

47:29.597 --> 47:31.212
Please.

47:42.777 --> 47:45.189
Can't you see what he's really like?

47:45.363 --> 47:48.446
-How can you think about being with him?
-My living room's wrecked.

47:48.616 --> 47:51.403
I've got a killer, a vampire
and a shape-shifter on my plate.

47:51.578 --> 47:54.945
Right about now, I'm not thinking about
being with anybody.

48:04.507 --> 48:06.463
This is where you live?

48:07.385 --> 48:08.716
Fuck me.

48:09.596 --> 48:11.962
Come on in, Tara.
Make yourself at home.

48:12.307 --> 48:13.422
If you insist.

48:13.975 --> 48:15.806
I insist. Come on.

48:39.375 --> 48:40.911
I knew it was you.

48:41.086 --> 48:43.077
I knew it from the second
we found Maudette.

48:43.630 --> 48:46.337
People said, "No, not Jason Stackhouse,
he's too dumb."

48:46.508 --> 48:51.298
But I knew. I said, "That shifty
bastard's a goddamn psychopath."

48:51.471 --> 48:54.338
-I ain't arguing with you, Andy.
-Detective.

48:55.016 --> 48:57.598
-Tell us all about it, son.
-|'|| tell you all about it.

48:57.769 --> 49:01.682
I'll tell you exactly what happened.
This piece of shit lured those poor girls...

49:01.856 --> 49:05.189
...into his king-sized bed and dirty sheets
to fuck them and kill them.

49:05.360 --> 49:08.352
Andy, he called us. Let the boy confess.

49:08.530 --> 49:10.612
Go ahead, Jason. How'd it happen?

49:13.451 --> 49:16.568
-I don't know.
-Oh, don't even try that on.

49:16.746 --> 49:19.863
Bud, give me five minutes alone with him.
I'll get you every detail.

49:20.041 --> 49:23.374
-What do you mean, you don't know?
-I don't remember what I done.

49:25.338 --> 49:26.544
To any of them.

49:27.215 --> 49:29.877
But they keep dying all around me...

49:30.051 --> 49:32.508
...so I gotta be the guy, right?

49:33.847 --> 49:37.260
-Let's take them one at a time.
-Yeah, let's start with Amy Burley.

49:37.433 --> 49:40.266
That ought to be fresh
in your so-called mind.

49:43.481 --> 49:45.017
I took V.

49:45.733 --> 49:48.691
Not with the others, just with her.
We both did.

49:48.862 --> 49:51.228
V? Jason, Jason.

49:51.614 --> 49:53.275
I knew it.

49:55.785 --> 49:57.696
When I woke up...

49:58.997 --> 50:00.828
...Amy was....

50:01.708 --> 50:04.450
-Well, like she was.
-"Dead" is the word you're looking for.

50:04.627 --> 50:06.879
Stone-cold dead.

50:10.425 --> 50:12.916
We were alone in the house.

50:16.055 --> 50:18.341
God, I must have done it.

50:20.476 --> 50:22.637
But I don't know why.

50:23.313 --> 50:25.554
Honest to God, I loved her.

50:25.732 --> 50:27.222
Bullshit.

50:27.400 --> 50:28.936
You hated Maudette.

50:29.110 --> 50:32.147
-You hated Dawn.
-I didn't hate them.

50:32.572 --> 50:38.238
I mean, we had some pretty good times. It
was fucking and fighting, like with any girl.

50:40.413 --> 50:44.656
I just-- I don't understand
what would have made me do it.

50:46.544 --> 50:48.455
Your grandmother
knew what you were like.

50:48.630 --> 50:51.212
She guessed, she called you out.
You grabbed a knife.

50:51.382 --> 50:53.589
No, I didn't kill Gran...

50:53.760 --> 50:55.421
...and you know it.

50:55.595 --> 50:57.460
You better damn well find who did.

50:57.639 --> 51:00.096
This is the worst confession
I ever heard in my life.

51:00.266 --> 51:02.552
Fuck you, Andy. That's all I got.

51:14.155 --> 51:15.565
Look...

51:16.783 --> 51:19.570
...I don't wanna hurt nobody else.

51:21.246 --> 51:22.406
Lock me up.

51:24.249 --> 51:26.240
For chrissake, lock me up.

51:27.919 --> 51:29.955
Not before we get some solid facts.

51:31.172 --> 51:33.254
We'll waterboard you
if that's what it takes.

51:33.424 --> 51:34.459
-Andy.
-What?

51:34.634 --> 51:36.340
Lock him up.

51:43.726 --> 51:46.513
Come on, now.
About time you found the law.

51:46.688 --> 51:50.306
Hey, you. Wake up.
I know it's early, but I gotta tell you--

51:50.483 --> 51:51.848
Wait. Somebody's coming.

51:58.783 --> 52:00.990
Girl, guess what?

52:01.160 --> 52:03.537
Jason Stackhouse is the murderer.

52:03.705 --> 52:08.119
Yes, I swear. He's looking all crazy
in a hot way, you know him.

52:08.293 --> 52:11.535
But they're throwing him
in a cell right now.

52:12.213 --> 52:15.296
We are so lucky he didn't kill us.
