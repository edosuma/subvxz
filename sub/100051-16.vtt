- Thank you for sticking up
for me today, Amanda.

28:30.056 --> 28:31.535
That wasn't easy, so...
- Yeah.

28:31.579 --> 28:33.450
Well, at least
it's all working out for now.

28:33.494 --> 28:35.104
Hey, you guys ready
for some ice cream?

28:35.148 --> 28:36.105
- Yeah!
- Let's go!

28:36.149 --> 28:37.063
- Come on.
- Come on, Fannie!

28:37.106 --> 28:38.325

28:46.289 --> 28:47.900
- What's going on?
- [coughs]

28:47.943 --> 28:49.466
- Kim, get the kids.

28:49.510 --> 28:51.294
Get them out of here.
Come on, come on, come on.

28:51.338 --> 28:52.295
Come on!

Hey, hey, hey!

Daddy?

Stop.
Oh!

29:04.830 --> 29:05.787
Hey.

29:05.831 --> 29:07.789
Uh, 355 West 117.

29:07.833 --> 29:08.790
Detective Rollins.

29:08.834 --> 29:10.096
I've got a 60-year-old man,

29:10.139 --> 29:15.449
a possible OD
of drugs and alcohol.

29:15.492 --> 29:17.538
[panting]

29:17.581 --> 29:19.192
Daddy!

29:28.244 --> 29:28.462

29:28.505 --> 29:30.725
- Hey, how's he doing?
- Not good.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.075
They gave him Narcan,
he's coming out of it, but...

29:33.119 --> 29:34.468
- But they said
we can't see him yet.

29:34.511 --> 29:35.817
- The kids?

29:35.861 --> 29:37.384
- I had my nanny come over,
but I don't know

29:37.427 --> 29:38.385
how long this is gonna be.

29:38.428 --> 29:39.690
- Okay.
I'm off shift.

29:39.734 --> 29:41.170
I can go pick them up,
they can stay with me.

29:41.214 --> 29:42.781
- Are we gonna get jammed up
over this?

29:42.824 --> 29:44.173
- Are you kidding me, Kim?

29:44.217 --> 29:46.088
Yeah, Daddy had a scrip
for the drugs,

29:46.132 --> 29:47.916
but as soon as family court
hears about this,

29:47.960 --> 29:49.265
they will take Mason back.

29:49.309 --> 29:51.398
- Oh, no!
What about my parole?

29:51.441 --> 29:52.878
Is that gonna mess that up too?

29:52.921 --> 29:56.490
- Kim, let's just take it
one day at a time now, okay?

29:56.533 --> 29:57.796
- Okay.

30:00.494 --> 30:02.235
- This is
District Attorney Carisi.

30:02.278 --> 30:03.845
He's gonna be
arraigning you soon.

30:03.889 --> 30:05.020
- Arraignment?
- Yeah.

30:05.064 --> 30:06.717
Prostitution and grand larceny.

30:06.761 --> 30:08.067
- What?

30:08.110 --> 30:09.372
- You want to get out
from under?

30:09.416 --> 30:10.939
Tell us who at Harrington
gives the orders.

30:10.983 --> 30:12.419
- Do I need a lawyer?

30:12.462 --> 30:13.986
- That's your right,
but they're just gonna tell you

30:14.029 --> 30:15.378
to cooperate with us.

30:15.422 --> 30:17.641
- You're asking me
to give up my bosses.

30:17.685 --> 30:19.687
- Mm-hmm.
- They pay me really well.

30:19.730 --> 30:22.211
- That's fine,
but the other girl we arrested?

30:22.255 --> 30:24.039
She's talking to us right now.

30:24.083 --> 30:25.040
- [chuckles]
Kathy?

30:25.084 --> 30:26.433
She just started.

30:26.476 --> 30:28.609
She doesn't know anything
about how this works.

30:28.652 --> 30:30.219
- But you do.

30:33.440 --> 30:34.876
- We kept the arrest low-key?

30:34.920 --> 30:36.138
- We're sitting on the doctor.

30:36.182 --> 30:37.836
- And what did the sales rep
give you?

30:37.879 --> 30:40.969
- Well, she claims that
this policy of sex-for-drugs

30:41.013 --> 30:43.058
came from the higher-ups
at Harrington.

30:43.102 --> 30:45.756
- Did she say from whom?
- Not explicitly.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.062
But she also said
the higher up you got,

30:47.106 --> 30:48.368
the less explicit it was.

30:48.411 --> 30:49.673
The big boys
insulate themselves.

30:49.717 --> 30:51.284
- Big boys--
I doubt she's privy

30:51.327 --> 30:52.589
to the boardroom's
inner workings.

30:52.633 --> 30:56.289
- Well, I agree,
but she did give us tickets

30:56.332 --> 30:59.205
to a benefit that Harrington
is hosting tomorrow night.

30:59.248 --> 31:00.771
- Trey?

31:00.815 --> 31:03.992
It's for bilingual education
in public schools.

31:04.036 --> 31:06.342
They're a very charitable
family.

31:06.386 --> 31:07.996
- Good for them,
but Harrington's

31:08.040 --> 31:09.432
entire team will be there.

31:09.476 --> 31:12.218
And Tiffany said
that she will introduce me

31:12.261 --> 31:16.265
to complicit sales execs,
including her supervisor,

31:16.309 --> 31:19.790
who has already offered me
a trip to St. John.

31:21.618 --> 31:23.185
- Okay.

31:25.274 --> 31:27.407
That's an opening.

31:29.975 --> 31:32.455
- Ms. Hadid.

31:32.499 --> 31:34.631
This is a culture
of corruption.

31:34.675 --> 31:36.329
Now, either Trey Harrington
has no idea

31:36.372 --> 31:38.331
how his business is being run

31:38.374 --> 31:40.028
or he's in on this.

31:40.072 --> 31:42.509
- That's not the man I know.

31:42.552 --> 31:44.946
But you need to pursue this
wherever this goes.

31:44.990 --> 31:46.121
Keep me in the loop.

31:46.165 --> 31:47.862
- Of course.

31:52.519 --> 31:55.652
- Good thing she's got
our backs on this.

31:55.696 --> 31:58.046
- Always.

31:58.090 --> 32:00.527
- Thank you.
I owe you.

32:00.570 --> 32:02.877
My nanny's cousin came over.
She'll take the next shift.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.358

Takes a village, doesn't it?

32:08.448 --> 32:11.277

what happens next?

32:11.320 --> 32:12.669
I mean, how is all this
gonna work,

32:12.713 --> 32:15.368
because I gotta tell you,
I have no idea.

32:17.544 --> 32:20.155
- Well,
it's like Olivia said.

32:20.199 --> 32:21.940
"One day at a time."

32:26.031 --> 32:28.337
Daddy's gonna wake up.

32:28.381 --> 32:30.296
We're gonna hug him.

32:30.339 --> 32:33.299
We're gonna be so thankful
he didn't die.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.476
- This time.

32:36.519 --> 32:39.131
- He did drive all the way
from Georgia when I called.

32:39.174 --> 32:40.393
- You're his daughter.

32:40.436 --> 32:43.483
That's what parents
are supposed to do.

32:44.875 --> 32:47.922

to forgive him,

32:47.966 --> 32:50.359

that I learned in group,

32:50.403 --> 32:52.361

32:55.886 --> 32:59.760
