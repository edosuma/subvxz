Well, Al, I got all the food
out of the refrigerator.

01:26.033 --> 01:27.634
You know, honey,

01:27.634 --> 01:30.067
I think it was real nice of you
to take Marcie's advice

01:30.067 --> 01:32.667
and hire a woman
to fix the refrigerator.

01:32.667 --> 01:35.868
I wish I could hire
somebody to fill it.

01:37.167 --> 01:39.200
Dream on, Al.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.534
Well, since someone's

01:40.534 --> 01:43.634
going to be doing
some work in the kitchen,

01:43.634 --> 01:45.501
I guess I'd better
go upstairs and rest.

01:55.334 --> 01:58.701
Well, I'm ready, Mr. Bundy.

01:58.701 --> 02:00.067
Me too.

check out the wiring.

I'll just be looking
over your, uh...

02:13.434 --> 02:15.467
shoulder.

Look at this.

Directions on how
to clean the oven.

02:21.534 --> 02:24.701
Still in its

That's
the little woman's.

02:26.367 --> 02:28.901

What's the emergency, Al?

02:39.667 --> 02:41.534
It's in the kitchen.

02:48.667 --> 02:51.667
You brought me
all the way over here

02:51.667 --> 02:53.167
just to see that?

02:53.167 --> 02:54.834
Uh-huh.

02:54.834 --> 02:57.467
Thanks, Al.

02:57.467 --> 03:01.834
Oh, you know, Al,
this brings back memories.

03:01.834 --> 03:06.200
I saw one of those
in college once.

03:06.200 --> 03:09.200
I used to jog
behind her for hours.

03:09.200 --> 03:13.200
I ran a marathon once
and didn't even know it.

03:13.200 --> 03:16.367
Ahh. You know her name?

03:16.367 --> 03:19.534
Yeah, but I'm
calling her Heidi.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.100
You know, Al,

03:22.100 --> 03:23.901
I feel kind of
like a pig,

03:23.901 --> 03:26.801
standing here,
enjoying myself,

03:26.801 --> 03:28.033
staring at a poor,
unsuspecting woman

03:28.033 --> 03:29.901
as if she were nothing
but a piece of meat.

03:32.067 --> 03:33.868
Look, Al, she's moving.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.834
Yeah, looks like
two little kittens

03:38.834 --> 03:40.968
playing gently
under some denim.

03:47.267 --> 03:51.701
I think it looks
more like an apple, Al.

03:51.701 --> 03:53.701
What kind
of apple, Steve?

03:53.701 --> 03:58.434
A little red one.

03:58.434 --> 04:01.934
You know how they are
just before you pick--

04:04.567 --> 04:06.767
You're a pig, Al.

04:06.767 --> 04:08.000
Oh, hello, Marcie.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.801
Well, I got to go
back to the shop

04:09.801 --> 04:10.868
and get some more tools.

04:10.868 --> 04:12.501
Hurry back.

This is why you left
the PBS pledge drive?

04:19.733 --> 04:24.167

like <i>Masterpiece Theatre.</i>

04:24.167 --> 04:26.434
I can't believe it.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.334
You're as bad as Al.

04:28.334 --> 04:29.968
You're worse than Al.

04:29.968 --> 04:32.067
He's nothing but
a Neanderthal sexist,

04:32.067 --> 04:33.534
but at least
he doesn't hide it.

04:33.534 --> 04:34.734
Hide it?

04:34.734 --> 04:38.534
I got a T-shirt
that says it.

04:38.534 --> 04:41.400
I never thought
I would say this,

04:41.400 --> 04:44.434

under that sensitive,
caring facade,

04:44.434 --> 04:46.100
you're nothing but a...

04:46.100 --> 04:47.334
a man!

Oh, hi there,
Marcie.

04:53.701 --> 04:55.834
Peggy, do you know
what is going on

04:55.834 --> 04:57.200
underneath your very own roof?

04:57.200 --> 04:59.701
Well, we're rotting
our lives away,

04:59.701 --> 05:02.334
but the kids
seem to enjoy it.

05:02.334 --> 05:03.868
Not that.

05:03.868 --> 05:07.200
Our husbands have been
ogling the repair girl.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.601
That's repair woman.

Oh, Marcie, calm
down.

at anything.

By the way, Marce,
what are you doing tonight?

05:25.067 --> 05:26.567
I don't know.

05:26.567 --> 05:29.033
Steve and I were going
to go to a fund raiser

05:29.033 --> 05:31.067
for my women's group,
but since I think

05:31.067 --> 05:32.501
he'd be spending
the whole evening

05:32.501 --> 05:33.934
looking up
the toastmaster's dress...

05:35.501 --> 05:37.067
I guess free tonight.

05:37.067 --> 05:38.567
Was it going to be
formal, Steve?

05:38.567 --> 05:40.567
You know, a bunch
of 300-pound women

05:40.567 --> 05:43.067
in crew cuts
and flannel shirts?

05:43.067 --> 05:45.767
Well, actually,
some wear tweed.

05:45.767 --> 05:47.567
Keep it up, Steven.

05:47.567 --> 05:52.434

that evolutionary scale.

Yes, Peg, I believe
I'm free tonight.

have planned?

05:55.968 --> 05:57.968
Well, why don't you
come over tonight?

05:57.968 --> 05:59.601
Some of the neighborhood
girls are dropping by.

05:59.601 --> 06:01.834
Sounds like fun.
I'll bring a cake.

06:01.834 --> 06:03.267
If there's
going to be a cake,

06:03.267 --> 06:04.868
you'd better watch
your fingers setting it out.

06:04.868 --> 06:06.868
One of the girls
has been known

06:06.868 --> 06:09.934
to debone a chicken
from across the room.

06:09.934 --> 06:14.601
It wasn't from
across the room, Al.

06:14.601 --> 06:16.701
I'll be here.

on your shoes

for secretary lunchtime.

Marce, come on,
so I stared at a hiney.

06:29.234 --> 06:32.601

make me a bad guy?

So, uh, Al...

06:35.734 --> 06:38.067
You were staring
at that girl too, huh?

06:38.067 --> 06:40.567

great legs.

any more cake?

your finger, Marcie.

of men like that,

wear shorts anymore.

because of the guys

when they're mad at you.

13:05.133 --> 13:06.133
Because they go out there,

13:06.133 --> 13:07.501
they see
what's available,

13:07.501 --> 13:09.868
you know, those fat,
bald-headed little twerps

13:09.868 --> 13:11.901
that have no idea
how lucky they are

13:11.901 --> 13:13.234
that they can't
get a woman,

13:13.234 --> 13:15.634
and they come crawling
back to you, thankful,

13:15.634 --> 13:18.100
knowing that there's no way
they can do better than us.

13:18.100 --> 13:19.767
See, let's face it,

13:19.767 --> 13:21.234
you don't go fishing
for minnows

13:21.234 --> 13:24.267
when you've got
Moby Dick at home.

13:32.234 --> 13:36.834
All that knowledge,
and you sell shoes.

13:36.834 --> 13:38.601
Hey, Michelangelo
was just a painter,

13:38.601 --> 13:39.667
but he did
other stuff too.

13:43.934 --> 13:47.567
Well, Al, this may come
as a shock to you,

13:47.567 --> 13:48.567
but I love my wife.

13:48.567 --> 13:49.968
I like being with her,

13:49.968 --> 13:51.868
and I'm not happy
when she's mad at me.

13:51.868 --> 13:54.934
So I'm going to find out
where this Troy'sis,

13:54.934 --> 13:56.400
and I'm going to go
and apologize.

13:57.868 --> 14:00.801
Hey, <i>Hot Tub Girls</i> is on.

14:03.300 --> 14:04.534
I don't care, Al.

14:04.534 --> 14:05.601
I'm going to go apologize.

14:10.467 --> 14:11.734
See, Al, it's time

14:11.734 --> 14:14.000
you joined
the 20th century.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
Appreciate women for
what they have up here,

14:17.000 --> 14:19.167
not for...
ho, they're huge.

14:25.767 --> 14:27.267
What are you doing?

14:27.267 --> 14:29.400
Hi, Bud.
Hi, Dad.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.567
I just wanted to talk to you
about something.

14:31.567 --> 14:33.501
Put a fire under it.

14:33.501 --> 14:37.167
Daddy's trying
to help Steve.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.100
It's about me and Kelly

14:39.100 --> 14:40.534
having to go
to Grandma's this weekend.

14:40.534 --> 14:41.868
What about it?

14:41.868 --> 14:45.200
Why are we being punished?

14:45.200 --> 14:46.701
Why am I?

14:46.701 --> 14:48.701
Why are any of us?

14:48.701 --> 14:52.133
Are we done, Bud?

14:52.133 --> 14:53.868
No, Dad.

14:53.868 --> 14:56.367
Look,  Grandma's
real nice and all,

14:56.367 --> 14:57.868
but that said,

14:57.868 --> 15:00.868
she smells.

15:00.868 --> 15:03.567
And she makes me
dance with her.

15:03.567 --> 15:05.934
Oh, Bud, do what I do.

15:05.934 --> 15:08.868
Ride on her feet.

15:08.868 --> 15:10.367
Please, Dad, send Kelly.

15:10.367 --> 15:11.868
She's used to dancing

15:11.868 --> 15:13.868
with smelly, old people
for money.

15:13.868 --> 15:16.934
Let me tell you something
about grandparents, son.

15:16.934 --> 15:19.467
They're your roots.
They're your heritage.

15:19.467 --> 15:22.467
And they're not going
to be around forever.

15:22.467 --> 15:25.467
But they do own
some lakefront property.

15:25.467 --> 15:26.901
You get my drift, son?

15:26.901 --> 15:28.300
Thanks, Dad.

15:28.300 --> 15:30.834
You're welcome.

15:30.834 --> 15:34.901
So... that's what they mean
by quality time?

15:34.901 --> 15:38.234
No, Steve. This is.

15:38.234 --> 15:40.634
Mr. Bundy, can I use
your bathroom?

15:44.667 --> 15:48.234
Uh... no.

15:48.234 --> 15:51.267
Well, then I'm
just about done then.

15:51.267 --> 15:54.334
Did I just hear
a car pull up?

15:54.334 --> 15:55.834
What's wrong with you?

15:55.834 --> 15:57.634
You've got to be
the only guy in America

15:57.634 --> 16:00.467
who actually
wants his wife to come home.

16:00.467 --> 16:03.100
Many's a night
I sit here,

16:03.100 --> 16:05.100
looking across
at my wife,

16:05.100 --> 16:07.434
as she's sitting over there,
much like you are,

16:07.434 --> 16:09.033
and I look at her,
and I think...

16:09.033 --> 16:10.734
go home.

16:14.701 --> 16:16.701
Then the horror hits me,

16:16.701 --> 16:18.701
because it dawns on me...

16:18.701 --> 16:21.701
she is home.

16:21.701 --> 16:24.934
Now look what you've done.
You've depressed me.

16:26.267 --> 16:28.067
Ooh.

16:28.067 --> 16:29.567
Daddy.

16:29.567 --> 16:31.067
It's like they know.

16:31.067 --> 16:32.767
What is it, honey?

16:32.767 --> 16:34.033
What's this about Bud
saying

16:34.033 --> 16:35.701
that only I have to go
to Grandma's?

16:35.701 --> 16:37.400
You're both going.

16:37.400 --> 16:40.334
Oh, come on, Dad.
It's just a waste of my time.

16:40.334 --> 16:43.334
She can't even
tell us apart anyhow.

16:43.334 --> 16:44.834
She's always telling Bud

16:44.834 --> 16:47.834
what a fine woman
he's growing into.

16:47.834 --> 16:51.300
Then she sends me
out to chop wood.

16:51.300 --> 16:53.367
They want to see you,

16:53.367 --> 16:56.367
and if you don't go to them,
they'll come here,

16:56.367 --> 16:59.033
and we can't afford
to reglaze the bathtub.

16:59.033 --> 17:00.033
Go on upstairs and pack.

17:00.033 --> 17:01.434
Fine. But this time,

17:01.434 --> 17:04.434
Bud can help her
cross her legs

17:04.434 --> 17:06.300
because I want to have
children some day.

17:10.367 --> 17:12.367
Al, you've got a...

17:12.367 --> 17:13.934
lovely daughter.

17:13.934 --> 17:15.934
Let me ask you this.

17:15.934 --> 17:17.434
When she grows up,

17:17.434 --> 17:20.434
don't you want her
to be appreciated

17:20.434 --> 17:21.968
for more than just
her physical beauty?

17:23.434 --> 17:26.099
Well, let's see, Steve,
how can I answer that?

17:26.099 --> 17:27.367
Well, let's see.

17:27.367 --> 17:29.868
Kelly, honey, come on
down here a second.

17:29.868 --> 17:31.200
Come here a minute, sweetheart.

17:31.200 --> 17:34.234
I want you to tell
Uncle Steve

17:34.234 --> 17:36.167
what your
guidance counselor said

17:36.167 --> 17:39.167
what career you'd be
best suited for.

17:39.167 --> 17:42.968
Lumber camp toy
or the other woman.

17:48.167 --> 17:50.901
Thank you, sweetheart.

17:50.901 --> 17:52.467
You were saying, Steve?

17:54.868 --> 17:55.868
Well, Mr. Bundy,
she's working.

17:55.868 --> 17:57.334
No, she's not.

17:57.334 --> 17:59.334
She's out
with the girls.

17:59.334 --> 18:01.334
How much do I owe you?

18:01.334 --> 18:02.501
80 bucks.

18:02.501 --> 18:07.033
$80 to fix
a big, hulking thing
that won't work,

18:07.033 --> 18:08.300
and $20 to marry one.

18:09.534 --> 18:11.534
Wait a second.

18:11.534 --> 18:14.133
This is where
I hide my money.

18:14.133 --> 18:16.734
Where did my money go?

18:44.734 --> 18:48.234
They keep it awfully
hot in here, don't they?

18:48.234 --> 18:52.033
Peggy, you just put a dollar
down that man's pants. Why?

18:52.033 --> 18:55.300
Because my checkbook
makes him walk funny.

18:58.767 --> 19:00.901
How long are we
going to be here?

19:00.901 --> 19:05.701
Not long. Just long
enough to spend this.

19:15.300 --> 19:17.434
Oh, my God!

19:31.200 --> 19:34.200
All right. That was
our construction worker.

19:34.200 --> 19:36.400
He's got a tool
for every occasion.

19:39.634 --> 19:41.767
I think I should be going.

19:41.767 --> 19:42.934
And now, ladies,

19:42.934 --> 19:45.367
let's give
a big Troy'swelcome

19:45.367 --> 19:46.868
for our Latin lover...

19:46.868 --> 19:49.000
El Zorro!

19:49.000 --> 19:52.334
 <i>Hola, muchacho!</i>

20:58.267 --> 21:00.267
Marcie, tip him.

21:00.267 --> 21:02.767
Go on! Go on!
Tip him! Tip him!

21:02.767 --> 21:05.934
I'm not putting money
down a man's pants.

21:05.934 --> 21:07.400
It's dirty...

21:07.400 --> 21:08.634
it's immoral...

21:08.634 --> 21:10.501
it's degrading.

21:13.934 --> 21:15.701
Dollars! Dollars!

21:15.701 --> 21:17.267
Give me more dollars!

21:17.267 --> 21:18.901
Marcie, calm down!

21:18.901 --> 21:21.667
Zorro doesn't come back
unless you give him dollars.

21:26.367 --> 21:28.033
Hey, Zorro!

21:28.033 --> 21:30.734
Bump it back this way, honey!

21:33.033 --> 21:34.400
That a boy!

21:53.634 --> 21:56.200
It's always
the quiet ones.

21:58.067 --> 22:01.634
* You'd better
Hold on to me... *

22:01.634 --> 22:02.868
[WOMAN MOANING]

22:22.133 --> 22:24.734
My wedding ring!
It's gone!

22:24.734 --> 22:26.901
Peggy, I've lost
my wedding ring

22:26.901 --> 22:27.868
down Zorro's pants!
