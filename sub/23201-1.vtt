WEBVTT

00:09.176 --> 00:11.178
Last night, I woke up

00:11.219 --> 00:13.514
with one of those 3:00 a.m. panic attacks,

00:13.555 --> 00:15.808
realized our "One Year Fertility Break"

00:15.850 --> 00:17.017
had turned into three

00:17.058 --> 00:20.646
and now I am way closer to 40 than 30.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.064
Yeah.

00:24.775 --> 00:26.652
We're like "That Couple with No Kids"

00:26.694 --> 00:28.028
in a family neighborhood.

00:28.069 --> 00:31.198
The neighbors kind of think we're pitiful and weird,

00:31.239 --> 00:32.533
which is ridiculous,

00:32.574 --> 00:34.618
because we're objectively so much better than them.

00:34.660 --> 00:35.619
But we're ready to try again.

00:35.661 --> 00:36.829
Totally. Yeah.

00:36.871 --> 00:38.664
We wanna do this. We're... We're all in.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.374
We are all in this time.

00:40.415 --> 00:42.125
: How often are you having sex?

00:42.167 --> 00:43.836
Excuse me?

00:43.878 --> 00:44.712
How often are we having sex?

00:44.753 --> 00:45.963
Uh...

00:46.005 --> 00:47.214
I mean, to be hon--

00:47.255 --> 00:48.632
we've been off our game a little bit lately.

00:48.674 --> 00:51.218
I've been working crazy hours on this huge pitch,

00:51.259 --> 00:53.220
for a fancy new theater at The Hamilton School,

00:53.261 --> 00:54.304
where Jack works?

00:54.346 --> 00:55.931
-She works... -So the last month...

00:55.973 --> 00:57.349
isn't really an accurate representation

00:57.391 --> 01:00.143
of how often we... have...

01:00.185 --> 01:01.562
intercourse. Ahem.

01:01.603 --> 01:02.646
Right. And also,

01:02.688 --> 01:04.899
I've been having this, like,

01:04.940 --> 01:07.401
persistent kind of acidy thing in my stomach here...

01:07.442 --> 01:09.444
That's... it's kind of a problem.

01:09.486 --> 01:10.445
Maybe the fact that I'm talking about it

01:10.487 --> 01:11.572
so incessantly

01:11.613 --> 01:12.907
is another factor

01:12.948 --> 01:16.117
in why we're not reaching our potential, I guess.

01:16.159 --> 01:19.120
I'd say we do it, uh... 1.5 times a week?

01:22.165 --> 01:24.292
I mean, not that we have fractional intercourse,

01:24.334 --> 01:25.920
She means...

01:25.961 --> 01:27.046
we have it, like, six times a month.

01:27.086 --> 01:28.797
: Hmm. -She-- she wrote it down.

01:28.839 --> 01:30.841
: Okay, got it.

01:30.883 --> 01:32.051
That means we're doing well?

01:32.091 --> 01:33.218
That's pretty good, right?

01:33.260 --> 01:35.136
Yeah, that's pretty good I would say, right?

01:35.178 --> 01:36.137
I mean, what's your--

01:36.179 --> 01:37.180
National average?

01:37.222 --> 01:38.057
Yeah, we're doing good, right?

01:53.321 --> 01:54.740
Sorry.

02:03.498 --> 02:04.416
: Trakarskys!

02:04.458 --> 02:06.251
How'd it go?

02:06.293 --> 02:08.670
The doctor asked us how often we had sex

02:08.712 --> 02:09.755
and we lied.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.423
With disturbing specificity.

02:11.465 --> 02:12.633
: Oh, you gotta lie.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.551
Like I'm gonna tell the whole neighborhood

02:14.593 --> 02:16.219
we haven't had sex in two months?

02:16.261 --> 02:17.679
Well, you just did.

02:17.721 --> 02:19.431
: Yoo-hoo!

02:19.473 --> 02:21.100
Oh, boy.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.392
Party time

02:22.434 --> 02:24.603
for the Real Housewives of Hawthorne Heights!

02:24.645 --> 02:25.813
Hey... Lori.

02:25.854 --> 02:26.855
Whoo!

02:26.897 --> 02:29.066
: Okay, carry on.

02:29.108 --> 02:31.526
Why would she be coming to Jenna Weeden's divorce party?

02:31.568 --> 02:33.862
They used to work together or something.

02:33.904 --> 02:36.197
You're gonna change before we go out, right?

02:36.239 --> 02:39.076
Nobody under 40's gonna hit on that biz-cas bullshit.

02:39.118 --> 02:40.285
Hey what are you doing?

02:40.327 --> 02:41.411
Wanna crack a couple beers, watch a game,

02:41.453 --> 02:42.788
maybe get some pizza?

02:42.830 --> 02:46.750
Um... no, I gotta read over some college essays, so.

02:46.792 --> 02:48.502
Is it because he's crying?

02:48.543 --> 02:49.837
Do I actually have to answer that question?

02:49.878 --> 02:50.838
It's called teething, okay?

02:50.879 --> 02:52.422
He's trying to get teeth.

02:52.464 --> 02:53.882
Imagine that for the first time.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.676
Making teeth.

02:55.717 --> 02:56.718
It's a big deal.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.095
Yeah. Thank you, honey.

03:12.818 --> 03:13.735
What the hell?

03:15.403 --> 03:16.488
What?

03:16.530 --> 03:18.532
Are you jacking off to football?

03:19.533 --> 03:20.868
No!

03:20.909 --> 03:23.578
That is so fucked up.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.496
I was just-- I was just cradling it.

03:24.538 --> 03:27.124
It's okay,

03:27.166 --> 03:29.043
because we...

03:29.084 --> 03:30.377
are about to do some intercourse.

03:35.298 --> 03:36.175
You ready for this?

03:38.969 --> 03:40.888
Meow!

03:42.181 --> 03:43.849
Do you know why...

03:43.891 --> 03:45.767
Jenna got divorced?

03:47.061 --> 03:48.311
I couldn't pick Jenna out of a lineup,

03:48.353 --> 03:49.938
so I have no idea who you're even talking about.

03:49.980 --> 03:52.107
Well, when the divorce party went "predictably dark--"

03:53.192 --> 03:54.568
Oh, my God.

03:54.609 --> 03:55.443
You have to have some water or something.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.529
She said they fell deeply

03:57.571 --> 04:00.532
"out of lust and deeply into like."

04:00.574 --> 04:02.910
You air quote so much when you're drunk.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.369
Does that sound familiar to you?

04:04.411 --> 04:05.746
Oh, yeah

04:05.787 --> 04:06.705
I don't know.

04:06.747 --> 04:07.998
That's good,

04:08.040 --> 04:11.001
'cause it is about to get real dirty up in here.

04:11.043 --> 04:12.044
Can you even hear what you're saying?

04:12.086 --> 04:13.921
Can you even hear yourself?

04:13.962 --> 04:14.963
Can you?

04:15.005 --> 04:16.131
Yeah.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.674
I can hear you.

04:17.716 --> 04:18.675
What does that even me?

04:20.343 --> 04:21.845
Oh, God. Did you smoke the entire pack of cigarettes?

04:24.347 --> 04:26.141
Did you eat an entire bag of Funions?

04:26.183 --> 04:28.018
Of course not.

04:28.060 --> 04:28.894
There's till some left, I think.

04:28.936 --> 04:29.978
Good...

04:30.020 --> 04:33.273
'cause this is raw.

04:33.314 --> 04:34.900
This is cigarettes and Funions and shit.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.986
Come here. Come here. Slap me.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.113
What?

04:39.154 --> 04:40.072
No.

04:40.114 --> 04:41.115
Pull my hair and spank me.

04:41.156 --> 04:42.365
This is seriously what you want?

04:42.407 --> 04:43.742
Spank me. Come on.

04:43.784 --> 04:44.910
What are you talking about?

04:44.952 --> 04:46.745
Spank me. Spank me. Spank me. Spank me.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.830
Like that. -I'm not doing it.

04:48.872 --> 04:49.957
-Try! -I'm not doing it.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.333
Ow! What the fuck?

04:53.752 --> 04:55.837
It was like a sexual atrocity.

04:55.879 --> 04:59.674
Seriously, arms were flailing, and breath was stinking.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.301
We should've filmed it for an abstinence PSA.

05:01.342 --> 05:04.721
Ah, the venerable cycle of masturbation.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.347
I don't think that's a thing.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.016
Oh, no. The less you get it on,

05:08.058 --> 05:09.309
the more you jack off.

05:09.350 --> 05:10.769
The more you jack off, the less you get it on.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.229
Well, maybe that is a thing.

05:12.271 --> 05:14.982
Shit, bro, you okay?

05:15.023 --> 05:16.775
I don't know, man. It's like...

05:16.817 --> 05:18.443
Is it really that serious?

05:18.485 --> 05:20.237
I think it might be. I think it is that serious.

05:20.279 --> 05:21.822
I mean, we love each other.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.074
That's-- it's not a like, it's a love situation.

05:24.116 --> 05:25.284
That's not the problem at all.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.577
We're, like, trying to manufacture passion,

05:27.619 --> 05:30.538
and it's resulting in me getting a fucking black eye.

05:30.580 --> 05:31.706
I would love to blame it

05:31.748 --> 05:33.708
on two years of, like, robotic baby sex,

05:33.750 --> 05:34.960
but even before that,

05:35.002 --> 05:36.003
it wasn't like it was "9 1/2 Weeks."

05:40.090 --> 05:41.008
Can you say something, please?

05:41.049 --> 05:42.176
I may or may not

05:42.217 --> 05:44.845
have done something in another dimension

05:44.886 --> 05:46.596
that no one in this universe could ever know about.

05:46.638 --> 05:48.640
It's like a tree

05:48.682 --> 05:49.891
falling in the forest,

05:49.933 --> 05:51.852
except it's my dick going into another woman.

05:51.893 --> 05:52.978
You had an affair?

05:53.020 --> 05:54.521
Hey, shh! No, no. It's too messy.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.481
God.

05:56.523 --> 05:57.858
Why don't you yell it, huh?

05:57.899 --> 05:59.442
I was startled.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.986
Because the legally deaf woman on the other side of that bridge

06:01.028 --> 06:01.945
can hear it.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.824
So... you were with a hooker?

06:05.866 --> 06:07.742
No. I'm talking about an escort.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.286
What's the difference?

06:10.369 --> 06:11.705
No penet

06:11.746 --> 06:13.040
Okay, okay.

06:13.081 --> 06:16.168
Sometimes, there's penetration, okay?

06:16.210 --> 06:18.712
But there's not supposed to be, right?

06:18.753 --> 06:19.754
That's why they can advertise.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.923
12, I don't know, something like that,

06:21.965 --> 06:23.050
sites here in Portland alone.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.885
When's the last time you guys made out?

06:24.926 --> 06:26.720
If I stuck my tongue in Emma's mouth,

06:26.761 --> 06:28.222
she'd probably just crack up laughing.

06:28.263 --> 06:29.597
You do it with someone you don't know,

06:29.639 --> 06:32.184
someone who doesn't laugh when you get your sexy on.

06:32.226 --> 06:33.768
This actually worked for you?

06:33.810 --> 06:35.436
You took this back into your bedroom?

06:35.478 --> 06:37.480
Fuckinay right I did.

06:37.522 --> 06:41.400
This is a lot for me to process over fuckin' hot cocoa.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.571
: <i>On today's Home Seekers,</i>

06:44.612 --> 06:46.781
<i>zookeeper Amanda</i> <i>and her accountant husband...</i>

06:46.823 --> 06:49.243
Oh, God...

06:49.284 --> 06:51.036
Oh, God.

06:51.078 --> 06:54.581
Homer, lock it down, buddy.

06:54.622 --> 06:55.999
Unbelievable.

06:59.169 --> 07:03.422
I have officially hit the age where a hangover lasts 24 hours.

07:03.464 --> 07:05.884
:<i> We've got</i> <i>our work cut out for us.</i>

07:05.926 --> 07:07.510
:<i> One thing</i> <i>I know about women,</i>

07:07.552 --> 07:09.846
<i>they never stop talking about</i> <i>bathtubs or closets.</i>

07:09.888 --> 07:11.265
<i>If I hear that line</i> <i>one more time,</i>

07:11.306 --> 07:13.183

07:18.063 --> 07:19.981
:<i> Claw-footed tub,</i> <i>authentic Victorian staircase...</i>

07:20.023 --> 07:21.149
What are you doing?

07:22.817 --> 07:25.653
I just thought maybe we could, you know...

07:25.695 --> 07:27.530
Are you seriously proposing sex right now,

07:27.572 --> 07:29.657
when I'm one pug fart away from regurgitating vital organs?

07:30.867 --> 07:32.411
Suddenly over it.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.376
If I die, know that I loved you.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.714
Love you more.

07:50.262 --> 07:51.554
What kind of monster

07:51.596 --> 07:54.891
lets a guy pay her 400 bucks to treat him like shit?

07:54.933 --> 07:56.935
You don't look like you're begging.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.395
<i>You don't realize</i>

07:58.437 --> 08:00.355
<i>what kind of a bargain</i> <i>you gave that dude.</i>

08:00.397 --> 08:03.775
He can have any woman, any thing he wants...

08:03.817 --> 08:05.319
except not getting what he wants.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.320
Crawl.

08:08.696 --> 08:09.823
Until you.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.158
Izzy Silva.

08:11.199 --> 08:12.367
His angel of denial.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.661
<i>Okay, Nina, that</i> <i>actually didn't suck,</i>

08:14.702 --> 08:16.746
<i>but do you have any idea</i> <i>how guilty I felt?</i>

08:16.788 --> 08:18.039
This morning,

08:18.081 --> 08:19.749
there was a homeless guy outside of our apartment,

08:19.791 --> 08:21.251
who asked me for a cigarette.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.086
So I gave him 80 bucks,

08:23.128 --> 08:25.255
hugged him, and said, "God bless you."

08:25.297 --> 08:27.757
I've never said that to anyone in my life before.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.217
"God bless you

08:29.259 --> 08:30.260
I am so disappointed in you, Iz.

08:30.302 --> 08:31.886
Translation:

08:31.928 --> 08:34.055
you don't want to float my half of the rent again.

08:34.097 --> 08:35.890
<i>Si, senora.</i>

08:35.932 --> 08:37.058
Fine.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.893
One more week.

08:38.935 --> 08:40.437
There's my little hooker.

08:40.479 --> 08:42.272
We're escorts. It's different.

08:42.314 --> 08:44.024
Oh, right, absolutely.

08:44.065 --> 08:46.234
It is different.

08:46.276 --> 08:49.029
-That's what you told me. -It is. Don't worry about it.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.572
I texted you, like. 20 times last night...

08:51.614 --> 08:53.158
Oh.

08:54.368 --> 08:55.702
Oh, my God, I think I just sprouted ovaries.

08:55.743 --> 08:56.703
You did?

08:56.744 --> 08:58.413
Yeah.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.290
I think I'm officially the chick in this relationship.

09:00.332 --> 09:02.292
That is so fucking sexist, Andy.

09:02.334 --> 09:05.045
Both genders pursue that which retreats from them.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.673
Oh, so you're baiting me, huh?

09:08.715 --> 09:09.716
Oh, get over yourself.

09:09.757 --> 09:12.511
You free tomorrow night, Andrea?

09:15.472 --> 09:18.392
Don't fuck with me, I'm menstruating, okay?

09:20.935 --> 09:22.645
Yes, I'm free.

09:22.687 --> 09:23.522
: Because of the complicated nature

09:23.563 --> 09:25.565
of rationalist thinking...

09:29.444 --> 09:31.196
Who is it?

09:31.238 --> 09:32.989
Another hubby lost his mojo.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.615
Easy-peasy. Bread and butter.

09:41.373 --> 09:42.541
<i>It's probably not fair,</i>

09:42.582 --> 09:44.625
but I kinda wanna pop you in the other eye.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.627
You do

09:46.669 --> 09:48.255
I don't know. I'm missing our old apartment,

09:48.296 --> 09:49.339
living downtown,

09:49.381 --> 09:50.382
being in the middle of everything.

09:50.424 --> 09:51.716
Why? Is there something else

09:51.758 --> 09:53.718
<i>I should be violently</i> <i>enraged about?</i>

09:53.760 --> 09:55.636
No. No. I can't think of anything.

09:55.678 --> 09:56.971
Are you drunk already?

09:57.013 --> 09:58.557
Maybe a little bit.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.141
Get drunker. You sound weird.

10:00.183 --> 10:01.435
I'll be home around 9:00.

10:01.476 --> 10:03.478
Okay. Have fun. I love you, weirdo.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.980
I love you more.

10:07.648 --> 10:09.650
Fuck. What the fuck am I doing?

10:09.692 --> 10:11.361
Oh, my God.

10:14.822 --> 10:16.657
Okay, this can be undone. Undo it.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.787
This is, um...

10:21.913 --> 10:23.873
Something came up at work.

10:23.915 --> 10:24.874
I have to cancel.

10:24.916 --> 10:27.001
Something...

10:27.043 --> 10:29.796
Something came up at work.

10:29.837 --> 10:31.839
Very sorry.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.716
I have to cancel.

10:35.843 --> 10:37.971
...And send.

10:40.932 --> 10:41.808
: Fred, are you in there?

10:41.849 --> 10:43.684
Um, no.

10:44.811 --> 10:45.770
Funny.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.985
-Hi, you. -Hi.

10:52.026 --> 10:54.446
Um, so I haven't exactly

10:54.488 --> 10:56.448
settled on a formal cancellation policy,

10:56.490 --> 10:58.492
but this is definitely not it.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.118
You need to get paid.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.328
I really do.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.037
-Yep.

11:04.956 --> 11:07.250
I'm sorry. Something came up at work.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.294
I had a...

11:10.587 --> 11:13.423
Um... um...

11:13.465 --> 11:14.341
It's a long story.

11:17.552 --> 11:18.637
Here it is.

11:18.677 --> 11:21.097
You are so not a Fred.

11:22.557 --> 11:23.475
What do you mean

11:23.517 --> 11:24.392
I have an Uncle Fred.

11:24.434 --> 11:25.602
Okay.

11:25.644 --> 11:28.146
Oh, my God. My scalp is sweating.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.356
Can you see that from here? The way--

11:30.482 --> 11:31.525
What do I owe you?

11:31.566 --> 11:32.691
So what was your excuse to the wife?

11:34.027 --> 11:35.236
My wife?

11:35.278 --> 11:36.863
Your wife. Yes.

11:36.904 --> 11:39.157
Um... Happy hour?

11:41.159 --> 11:42.701
Well, you have a mini-bar.

11:42.743 --> 11:43.702
I do?

11:43.744 --> 11:45.163
Yep.

11:55.256 --> 11:56.341
So when did you know

11:56.383 --> 11:59.386
you wanted to be a high school counselor?

11:59.427 --> 12:02.430
I'm not a high school counselor, first of all.

12:02.472 --> 12:05.392
I am Assistant Dean, Head of Student Services.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.767
Oh...

12:06.809 --> 12:08.144
Yup.

12:08.186 --> 12:09.103
Sorry. That's very different.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.522
It's a big difference, yeah.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.023
Is it?

12:12.065 --> 12:13.650
Kind of like the difference between prostitute and escort.

12:13.692 --> 12:14.775
Mm.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.236
Okay, well,

12:16.277 --> 12:18.405
as clearly stated on my profile, I don't screw my clients,

12:18.446 --> 12:20.448
so, yeah, it is very different.

12:20.490 --> 12:21.866
You can answer the question now.

12:21.908 --> 12:25.453
I was kind of a hot mess in high school,

12:25.495 --> 12:26.705
and...

12:26.745 --> 12:28.039
Don't look at me like that.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.541
This isn't-- this is a true story.

12:29.583 --> 12:32.460
I wasn't too popular with the faculty, really,

12:32.502 --> 12:33.836
except for this one counselor,

12:33.878 --> 12:35.589
and she was really great, and she kind of saved me--

12:35.630 --> 12:37.131
Fred, this sounds like a story

12:37.173 --> 12:38.966
that you've told at a few dozen barbecues.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.218
Why don't you give me the real shit?

12:40.260 --> 12:41.553
Ouch.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.597
My father was a cheating asshole

12:43.638 --> 12:45.014
in a V-neck sweater,

12:45.056 --> 12:46.933
so my bullshit detector is, like, wicked sensitive.

12:46.974 --> 12:48.851
So you're an escort with daddy issues?

12:48.893 --> 12:49.852
That's so rare.

12:49.894 --> 12:50.811
Blow me, Fred.

12:52.522 --> 12:53.565
Well...

12:56.276 --> 12:57.318
I know what you were saying before,

12:57.360 --> 12:59.112
by the way, about, like, your family,

12:59.153 --> 13:00.530
because my family, also, was, like...

13:00.572 --> 13:02.781
a quiet little corner of hell.

13:02.823 --> 13:05.826
Mine was shiny perfection right up until it wasn't.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.412
Yeah, Mom's been on

13:07.454 --> 13:08.787
the Geese 'n' Oxy diet ever since.

13:08.829 --> 13:10.206
Is that something I should know?

13:10.248 --> 13:14.294
Vodka and pain pills. Yeah. I'll never be like her.

13:14.335 --> 13:16.421
So instead, you just do this?

13:16.463 --> 13:17.589
Hmm?

13:17.631 --> 13:18.632
Just kind of like an emotional tourist.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.637
Damn, Fred. That's... That's pretty good, actually.

13:28.558 --> 13:29.559
I'm Jack, by the way.

13:29.601 --> 13:30.809
I can't do this any longer.

13:30.851 --> 13:32.312
It's Jack Trakarsky.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.854
Jack Trakarsky.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.189
I'm Izzy Silva.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.608
Izzy Silva.

13:36.650 --> 13:37.900
I've never told a client my full name before.

13:45.992 --> 13:46.867
It's a long handshake.

13:46.909 --> 13:47.868
Yeah.

13:50.204 --> 13:51.623
It might be the light beer,

13:51.665 --> 13:55.001
the craft beer, the vodka, and the wine talking,

13:55.042 --> 13:57.253
but...

13:57.295 --> 13:59.005
I don't think that I stayed

13:59.046 --> 14:00.340
just because you have a mini-bar.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.426
No?

14:03.468 --> 14:05.219
You're not too old or too annoying.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.262
So...

14:06.304 --> 14:07.347
Thank you.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.348
I figured there are worse ways

14:08.389 --> 14:10.266
to avoid doing a sociology essay.

14:10.308 --> 14:13.227
And you are also unhideous.

14:14.395 --> 14:17.691
You think I'm unhideous?

14:17.732 --> 14:18.899
That's cool.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.403
Do you wanna make out?

14:24.572 --> 14:25.865
Shit. Sorry.

14:25.906 --> 14:29.202
Nope.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.620
I sound crazy.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.246
I promise I won't boil your rabbit.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.374
I don't have a rabbit, so you can't.

14:34.415 --> 14:35.375
I have a pug.

14:35.416 --> 14:36.626
Who boils a pug?

14:36.668 --> 14:38.002
I'm not a monster.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.046
Do you have a cat, though?

14:41.464 --> 14:42.965
No, I don't have a cat.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.269
Um...

14:55.311 --> 14:56.312
oh, shit.

14:56.354 --> 14:57.313
We're-- we're over.

14:57.355 --> 14:58.606
I'm sorry. I should--

14:58.648 --> 14:59.566
Thank you.

15:01.192 --> 15:04.487
So I guess you better make a move on me now, right?

15:06.698 --> 15:09.909
That's the hole in your game, isn't that what you said?

15:09.950 --> 15:11.703
Show me what you got.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.789
Um...

15:15.832 --> 15:17.542
Okay.

15:19.627 --> 15:20.837
I mean, come on,

15:20.879 --> 15:21.962
we're never gonna see each other again, right?

15:22.004 --> 15:23.923
Okay. Okay.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.341
Um... I'm bringin' it.

15:25.383 --> 15:27.134
No. Don't say that.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.969
It's been a while for me.

15:31.472 --> 15:32.807
Um...

15:34.934 --> 15:35.894
Hi.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.771
Hi.

15:37.812 --> 15:39.647
You're like a unicorn.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.151
Okay...

15:44.193 --> 15:46.529
that's not what I was going for, but...

15:46.571 --> 15:48.823
we can keep going.

15:48.865 --> 15:51.033
No, I mean you're the rare girl that looks better up close.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.076
Like, the closer I get to you, it's--

15:52.118 --> 15:54.036
No, that-- that was nice.

15:54.078 --> 15:54.995
-Yeah.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.291
You're nice, I think.

15:58.332 --> 16:00.000
Sorry.

16:35.578 --> 16:36.621
-Fuckinay. -No, it's fine, it's fine.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.832
It's my roommate's. Keep your focus.

16:40.625 --> 16:41.751
I'll pay for that--

16:41.793 --> 16:43.419
No, it's-- Shush.

16:47.799 --> 16:49.216
I'm sorry. This is not--

16:49.258 --> 16:50.927
That was way too far.

16:50.969 --> 16:52.595
Jesus, I can't do this. What's wrong with me?

16:52.637 --> 16:53.680
No, you know, I--

16:53.721 --> 16:55.598
It's all good. This is my bad.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.350
The booze and the unicorn line definitely factored in, but--

16:57.391 --> 16:59.226
you know what,

16:59.268 --> 17:00.854
let's take it back.

17:00.895 --> 17:01.896
Let's pretend this didn't happen.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.564
-Okay. -Okay, yeah.

17:04.774 --> 17:05.692
This is my wife.

17:08.235 --> 17:09.195
I'm gonna go.

17:09.236 --> 17:10.780
Yeah.

17:10.822 --> 17:11.739
Hey, babe.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.827
No. I...

17:15.869 --> 17:18.204
I'm going to be home...

17:26.754 --> 17:28.589
Okay, so...

17:29.924 --> 17:32.051
All right. I love you more. Bye.

17:32.092 --> 17:33.052
Fuck.

17:41.352 --> 17:44.146
: Are you fucking kidding me?

17:44.188 --> 17:45.231
I came clean!

17:45.272 --> 17:46.733
Don't I get points for coming clean?

17:46.774 --> 17:47.901
"Points?"

17:47.942 --> 17:49.151
I don't know.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.695
You want fucking "points"?

17:50.737 --> 17:51.946
You get points for admitting

17:51.988 --> 17:53.865
to scarfing down the second half of my panini,

17:53.907 --> 17:55.783
not for confessing to spending happy hour

17:55.825 --> 17:57.076
in a hotel room with a hooker!

17:57.117 --> 17:58.077
She's an escort.

17:58.118 --> 17:59.579
Oh, great.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.998
She's an escort, okay?

18:02.040 --> 18:03.541
She's, like, getting her Master's in psychology, so.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.376
Mm-hmm.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.045
Sex was never part of the agenda, I swear.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.922
I made sure it wasn't.

18:08.963 --> 18:09.881
It said it right in the profile.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.465
You're a fucking idiot.

18:13.342 --> 18:14.385
Are you...

18:14.427 --> 18:17.597
figuring out ways to kill me?

18:17.638 --> 18:20.016
Tell me more.

18:20.058 --> 18:22.018
Tell me more about this fascinating young lady.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.143
It's not about her.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.854
Oh, so you did find her fascinating.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.274
I don't know. I mean--

18:29.776 --> 18:31.611
That was well said, Jack.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.780
Let me rephrase the question...

18:37.241 --> 18:38.325
Did you like her?

18:42.413 --> 18:43.456
Oh, my God.

18:43.497 --> 18:44.916
This has nothing to do with her.

18:44.958 --> 18:47.376
This is about us, okay?

18:53.800 --> 18:55.175
Did anything happen?

18:55.217 --> 18:57.678
We didn't have sex. We absolutely did not have sex.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.388
That's not what I asked, Jack.

18:59.430 --> 19:00.974
Did anything happen?

19:01.015 --> 19:04.351
I want you to tell me precisely what you did with that girl.

19:06.228 --> 19:10.190
We made out, for, like, a brief time...

19:10.232 --> 19:11.734
and then I snapped out of it,

19:11.776 --> 19:13.486
and I-- and that was it, it was over.

19:25.081 --> 19:26.958
Show me.

19:28.126 --> 19:29.085
Show you what?

19:29.127 --> 19:30.210
I want to see her.

19:30.252 --> 19:32.171
Honey, that's not a good idea.

19:32.212 --> 19:33.840
Show me.

19:38.302 --> 19:39.219
Are you serious?

19:39.261 --> 19:40.220
Do it.

19:47.061 --> 19:48.855
I think maybe we should talk about this.

19:48.896 --> 19:50.773
Do it.

19:52.066 --> 19:53.109
: I made him show me what she looked like.

19:53.151 --> 19:54.027
: And did he?

19:54.068 --> 19:55.277
Yeah.

19:55.319 --> 19:56.612
Eventually.

19:56.654 --> 19:57.697
Was she a total skeeze?

19:57.738 --> 20:00.574
Actually...

20:00.616 --> 20:02.160
she looks... exactly like what she is--

20:05.204 --> 20:06.580
a grad student from Colorado.

20:06.622 --> 20:07.915
Look at her skin.

20:07.957 --> 20:08.875
Make it bigger.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.501
It's perfect.

20:10.543 --> 20:11.878
Do you ever see that movie "Mask"

20:11.919 --> 20:13.504
with Eric Stoltz in the '80s?

20:13.546 --> 20:15.006
It's like a Doppelganger. Turn it away. Please.

20:16.382 --> 20:17.550
You're a good friend.

20:17.591 --> 20:18.551
I try.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.260
I hate her!

20:20.302 --> 20:21.929
-I don't know.

20:21.971 --> 20:24.891
Probably.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.225
I mean, it's worse than if he just fucked her, right?

20:28.352 --> 20:29.770
He met up with her, he liked her,

20:29.812 --> 20:32.314
he confided in her...

20:32.356 --> 20:34.859
he made out with her-- they made out.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.736
We don't make out anymore.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.278
It's so...

20:38.320 --> 20:39.780
intimate.

20:39.822 --> 20:42.658
He practically sprinted home to confess at your bedside.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.785
I mean, who does that, right?

20:47.121 --> 20:48.497
Oh, fuck.

20:48.539 --> 20:51.250
He took relationship advice from his loser brother?

20:51.291 --> 20:52.668
Was John Mayer out of the country?

20:56.422 --> 20:58.174
So what are you gonna do?

21:07.307 --> 21:09.977
So which one of you lovely ladies is Lola?

21:12.605 --> 21:13.522
Well...

21:23.908 --> 21:26.368
Okay, Lola...

21:26.410 --> 21:27.828
tell me something about yourself.

21:27.870 --> 21:29.038
What're you into?

21:29.080 --> 21:30.790
What's... what's... What's your jam?

21:30.831 --> 21:31.791
What's my jam?

21:31.832 --> 21:32.750
I don't know.

21:36.336 --> 21:38.214
Okay...

21:38.256 --> 21:41.425
Can I be honest with you?

21:41.467 --> 21:42.468
I'm a little drunk.

21:42.509 --> 21:44.428
No shit. Really?

21:44.470 --> 21:46.764
Okay, but here's the thing--

21:46.806 --> 21:48.975
I usually-- I usually get drunk,

21:49.016 --> 21:50.559
because I get so nervous before these things,

21:50.601 --> 21:51.894
but you are my first lady date,

21:51.936 --> 21:54.605
so I got, like, double--

21:54.647 --> 21:55.522
double super nervous. Well, you're doing well.

22:00.236 --> 22:02.321
Wow, you are really pretty.

22:02.362 --> 22:04.115
Okay...

22:04.157 --> 22:05.407
For my age?

22:06.742 --> 22:09.578
And very angry.

22:09.620 --> 22:11.956
Are you shrinking me now, Izzy?

22:13.415 --> 22:15.209
Wait. What? How did you--

22:16.335 --> 22:17.753
Never mind.

22:27.638 --> 22:28.806
Do you ever read a book

22:28.848 --> 22:30.348
and you know exactly what's on the next page?

22:32.434 --> 22:35.729
There are zero surprises...

22:35.771 --> 22:37.023
you know,

22:37.064 --> 22:41.359
and you think, "I must've read this before."

22:41.401 --> 22:44.905
But... no way, because it just came out.

22:49.785 --> 22:51.162
I'm gonna go.

22:53.206 --> 22:54.414
I helped make this mess,

22:56.834 --> 22:57.877
What was that?

22:57.918 --> 22:58.794
Oh, you dropped your--

23:00.338 --> 23:01.922
Oh.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.342
Surprise.

23:05.926 --> 23:07.220
Can you be cool?

23:07.261 --> 23:09.180
Yeah.

23:12.390 --> 23:13.600
A little cooler than that,

23:13.642 --> 23:15.061
because you look like somebody

23:15.102 --> 23:16.812
who's getting a foot job under the table.

23:16.854 --> 23:18.772
I am getting a foot job under the table.

23:25.946 --> 23:27.156
Hi.

23:27.198 --> 23:28.074
Am I doing it right?

23:30.201 --> 23:31.202
Do you want me to stop?

23:31.244 --> 23:34.163
Shit, am I freaking you out?

23:34.205 --> 23:35.539
This was Nina's idea

23:35.581 --> 23:36.582
and then you said you had no surprises in your life,

23:36.623 --> 23:39.085
and that made me really sad, actually,

23:39.126 --> 23:40.544
and have I mentioned that I'm pretty drunk?

23:40.586 --> 23:43.297
Okay, I'm gonna need you to stop blathering

23:43.339 --> 23:46.092
and look me in the eye.

24:19.541 --> 24:21.043
Okay.

24:25.505 --> 24:26.382
Are you okay?

24:31.053 --> 24:33.389
I don't think so.

24:33.431 --> 24:36.183
But-- but--

24:36.225 --> 24:37.643
Lola!

24:46.193 --> 24:47.153
Lola?

24:49.571 --> 24:50.906
I just wanted to make sure--

24:50.948 --> 24:52.532
Make sure you got paid?

24:52.574 --> 24:54.618
No.

24:54.660 --> 24:57.955
I was actually... worried about you.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.081
Oh, the venerable hooker with a heart of gold.

24:59.123 --> 25:01.208
Lucky me. Take it.

25:02.460 --> 25:04.670
A, I am not a hooker,

25:04.711 --> 25:06.297
and B, you called me,

25:06.339 --> 25:08.341
so...

25:08.382 --> 25:09.883
My name is Emma.

25:10.926 --> 25:13.262
Hi, Emma.

25:13.304 --> 25:15.931
I'm Jack's wife.

25:17.099 --> 25:18.017
Okay...

25:20.394 --> 25:21.854
Minibar Makeout Guy from last night?

25:21.895 --> 25:23.356
What?

25:23.397 --> 25:24.690
Yeah.

25:24.731 --> 25:26.859
Why would you do this?

25:26.900 --> 25:28.777
He liked you.

25:28.819 --> 25:30.570
I wanted to find out why.

25:31.738 --> 25:33.240
Well, did you?

25:35.533 --> 25:38.162
I mean, find out why he liked me?

25:40.622 --> 25:41.874
Yeah.

25:44.335 --> 25:45.711
Unfortunately, I did.

25:52.176 --> 25:54.011
I like you right back, Emma.

26:00.267 --> 26:01.227
So, I'm... I'm just gonna...

26:01.268 --> 26:03.396
Izzy?

26:28.295 --> 26:29.755
Surprise.

26:45.687 --> 26:46.813
Hi.

26:46.855 --> 26:48.941
Oh...

26:51.985 --> 26:53.362
Are you eating here, or?

26:53.404 --> 26:55.072
No, I... You know what, it's--

26:56.198 --> 26:57.116
Interesting fact--

26:57.157 --> 26:58.242
it turns out

26:58.284 --> 26:59.326
four out of five Griffin grad students

26:59.368 --> 27:00.660
actually live in this building, so--

27:02.037 --> 27:03.038
Plus, I saw

27:03.080 --> 27:04.706
your name on the directory

27:04.748 --> 27:06.083
in the foyer.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.001
I've been pushing the button non-stop.

27:08.043 --> 27:09.753
Okay.

27:13.882 --> 27:14.758
Can we sit down for a sec?

27:14.800 --> 27:16.676
Yeah, sure.

27:20.722 --> 27:21.639
I love my wife.

27:21.681 --> 27:23.850
I really do.

27:23.892 --> 27:25.685
Just so you know that.

27:25.727 --> 27:28.272
And I, um...

27:28.314 --> 27:29.607
She's one of the few things in my life

27:29.689 --> 27:31.942
that I'm actually sure of.

27:33.651 --> 27:35.446
Jack, I was your escort.

27:35.488 --> 27:37.197
You don't have to break up with me.

27:37.239 --> 27:38.198
You just don't call me again.

27:42.702 --> 27:45.705
Um...

27:50.127 --> 27:52.963
I like you, like, a lot,

27:53.005 --> 27:54.881
and... we can't have that, so.

27:57.801 --> 27:59.512
I don't know when I'm gonna stop thinking about you.

27:59.553 --> 28:02.181
I just really, really hope it's soon.

28:04.642 --> 28:06.226
That's what I wanted to...

28:23.243 --> 28:24.620
-Okay. Bye. -Bye.

28:28.248 --> 28:29.416
: <i>The reason why I hired you</i>

28:29.458 --> 28:31.377
<i>is to save my marriage,</i> <i>actually.</i>

28:31.418 --> 28:32.961
<i>I don't think</i>

28:33.003 --> 28:34.754
<i>I'm like the other guys</i> <i>that hire you, to be honest.</i>

28:34.796 --> 28:35.797
<i>I came to this</i>

28:35.839 --> 28:36.798
<i>with, like, really...</i>

28:36.840 --> 28:38.342
good intentions.

28:38.384 --> 28:40.219
That sounds so crazy.

28:53.440 --> 28:54.191
<i>My marriage is in this,</i> <i>like, weird place.</i>

28:54.233 --> 28:55.192
Hey.

28:55.234 --> 28:58.028
Hey.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.321
I really don't talk about it with anyone,

28:59.363 --> 29:00.531
but for some reason,

29:00.573 --> 29:02.157
I feel comfortable talking about it with you.

29:04.868 --> 29:05.952
What's that about?

29:07.996 --> 29:08.872
You're beautiful.

29:10.457 --> 29:11.750
Yeah

29:11.791 --> 29:13.210
What's rockin' your world hardest,

29:13.252 --> 29:15.003
my Pebbles' 'do or my thermal socks?

29:16.213 --> 29:19.508
I thought that this might help...

29:19.550 --> 29:21.927
in my wife and I's situation.

29:21.968 --> 29:23.262
I'm sorry.

29:26.348 --> 29:27.391
So am I.

29:34.314 --> 29:35.524
What're you doing?

29:37.984 --> 29:39.027
Can I turn this off?

29:39.069 --> 29:40.738
What're you doing?

29:40.779 --> 29:41.988
This is gonna take longer than three minutes.

29:42.030 --> 29:43.115
-Yeah.

29:43.156 --> 29:44.408
Yeah?

29:44.450 --> 29:47.160
Although probably no more than eight.

29:49.538 --> 29:51.290
Are we seriously gonna do it on the kitchen floor?

29:51.331 --> 29:52.916
Mm-hmm.

29:57.588 --> 29:59.131
I'll take that as a yes.

30:02.760 --> 30:07.139
What the fuck?

30:07.180 --> 30:08.432
Izzy?

30:17.524 --> 30:19.067
Oh, my God!

30:21.987 --> 30:23.489
What the hell happened?

30:24.698 --> 30:25.741
You're what happened.

30:25.783 --> 30:27.701
What

30:27.743 --> 30:30.120
Listen to me closely, Nina.

30:30.162 --> 30:31.789
I quit.

30:31.830 --> 30:35.125
Yup. I'm serious this time, okay?

30:35.167 --> 30:37.586
I'm done getting tangled in people's lives,

30:37.628 --> 30:39.505
and if you try to talk me out of it,

30:39.546 --> 30:40.798
I will snap,

30:40.839 --> 30:42.508
like, go the fuck off.

30:42.549 --> 30:43.467
Do you understand me?

30:43.509 --> 30:45.218
Yup.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.720
Yeah. Roger that.

30:51.057 --> 30:52.559
I'm very resentful

30:52.601 --> 30:54.478
that I don't have a fucking solid door right now.

30:54.520 --> 30:55.979
You chose that room!

30:56.021 --> 30:57.648
Stop talking to me!

31:06.657 --> 31:07.741
What're you thinking?

31:11.453 --> 31:12.329
I met Izzy today.

31:13.955 --> 31:14.998
What?

31:15.040 --> 31:16.958
We made out.

31:19.753 --> 31:22.756
After she gave me a footjob under the table.

31:27.344 --> 31:28.512
And I probably should've told you this

31:28.554 --> 31:30.013
a long, long time ago,

31:30.055 --> 31:32.098
but, um...

31:32.140 --> 31:33.767
she wasn't my first girl.

31:36.603 --> 31:38.605
Or my second.
