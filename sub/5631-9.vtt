male narrator:
In the criminal justice system,

00:08.609 --> 00:12.046
sexually-based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:12.046 --> 00:13.314
In New York City,

00:13.314 --> 00:15.283
the dedicated detectives
who investigate

00:15.283 --> 00:17.785
these vicious felonies
are members of an elite squad

00:17.785 --> 00:19.687
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.687 --> 00:22.323
These are their stories.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.826
(Benson)
Just need to hear you say it.

00:25.826 --> 00:28.028
- Ugh, yeah?

00:28.028 --> 00:30.764
I did it, okay?
- Okay.

00:30.764 --> 00:33.101
Uh, that kid,
I don't know his name.

00:33.101 --> 00:36.137
- Hector Rodriguez.
- I don't know!

00:38.272 --> 00:39.607
He had a backpack.

00:39.607 --> 00:40.774
He started talking to me.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.611
Bugging me.
- How?

00:43.611 --> 00:46.046
- Followed me back
to my building.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.249
- And?

00:48.249 --> 00:49.617
- What?

00:49.617 --> 00:52.653
- What happened?

00:55.523 --> 00:58.025
- Nothing happened.

00:58.025 --> 00:59.893
[suspenseful music]

00:59.893 --> 01:02.996
- Well, something happened.

01:02.996 --> 01:06.267
- I'm not doing this.
I'm not--what?

01:06.267 --> 01:07.668
- I'm just asking you.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.770
- Nothing happened!

01:09.770 --> 01:11.605
- Okay.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.274
- But he said he was going to
tell his mother something did.

01:13.274 --> 01:15.176
I can't have that.
- So?

01:15.176 --> 01:17.678
- [deep breath]

01:17.678 --> 01:19.147
So I snapped his neck.

01:19.147 --> 01:20.681
- So you did do it?

01:20.681 --> 01:22.483
- Nothing happened.

01:22.483 --> 01:24.218
But he said he was going to
tell his mother something did.

01:24.218 --> 01:27.155
I can't have that,
so I snapped.

01:27.155 --> 01:28.556
And so did his neck.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.057
Okay?

01:30.057 --> 01:31.992
And I put him under
the concrete slab.

01:31.992 --> 01:33.827
Why'd you ask me that?

01:33.827 --> 01:35.863
We had an agreement.

01:35.863 --> 01:43.904
*

01:51.078 --> 01:54.081
- Mr. Guthrie, I understand
your client has a plea.

01:54.081 --> 01:55.749
- Yes, Your Honor.

01:55.749 --> 01:58.852
To the charges of murder
in the second degree

01:58.852 --> 02:01.789
and kidnapping in
the first degree,

02:01.789 --> 02:03.457
he pleads guilty.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.992
- Okay, then.

02:04.992 --> 02:06.260
Mr. Hodda,

02:06.260 --> 02:09.297
I need to hear that from you.

02:11.999 --> 02:15.035
Mr. Hodda?

02:17.205 --> 02:19.773
Mr. Guthrie?

02:19.773 --> 02:22.943
- [indistinct whispering]

02:31.485 --> 02:33.020
- No.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.255
I'm not doing time for this.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.823
I'm not doing time
for this.

02:35.823 --> 02:36.957
No.

02:36.957 --> 02:38.592
- Do we have a plea
or don't we?

02:38.592 --> 02:39.693
- We've all agreed
to one, Your Honor.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.362
- Everyone was yelling at me.

02:41.362 --> 02:42.830
- Who was yelling at you,
Mr. Hodda?

02:42.830 --> 02:43.997
- He was.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.499
My own lawyer was.

02:45.499 --> 02:48.536
Before that she was.

02:49.603 --> 02:53.874
I didn't harm these boys.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.344
None of them.

02:56.344 --> 02:58.979
I swear to God,
Your Honor.

02:58.979 --> 03:02.250
I'm innocent.

03:02.250 --> 03:05.586
[suspenseful music]

03:05.586 --> 03:07.621
- We'll wait for your attorney,
Mr. Hodda.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.290
Is he on his way?
- No.

03:09.290 --> 03:11.058
No, I fired that hack.

03:11.058 --> 03:13.126
- Well, you need an attorney.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.161
- Yeah, well, I'll be
my own lawyer.

03:14.161 --> 03:17.030
Guy wanted to put me
in a box.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.165
Just like she does.

03:18.165 --> 03:19.867
- Uh, Mr. Barba,
is there a reason

03:19.867 --> 03:21.535
why Lieutenant Benson joined us?

03:21.535 --> 03:23.003
- Because I took
the defendant's confession.

03:23.003 --> 03:25.273
- There was no confession.
- It's on video.

03:25.273 --> 03:27.174
- I'd like to remind Mr. Hodda
how strong our case is,

03:27.174 --> 03:29.477
and it's in his best interests
to honor the deal that he made.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.279
- There was no deal.

03:31.279 --> 03:33.347
She put words in my mouth!

03:33.347 --> 03:35.749
She threatened me!

03:35.749 --> 03:37.318
She hammered at me for hours!

03:37.318 --> 03:40.554
- Because you admitted to
kidnapping Wyatt Morris,

03:40.554 --> 03:43.657
a seven-year-old child, who
would be dead in that basement

03:43.657 --> 03:44.892
if you didn't tell us
where he was.

03:44.892 --> 03:48.662
- Oh, so...I saved his life.

03:48.662 --> 03:49.730
That's what you're saying.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.864
That's my crime?
I saved his life?

03:50.864 --> 03:53.066
- You admitted to
kidnapping him,

03:53.066 --> 03:58.306
just like you admitted
to killing Hector Rodriguez.

03:58.306 --> 04:00.073
- Words in my mouth.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.609
You're putting words
in my mouth.

04:01.609 --> 04:03.544
- Mr. Hodda,
I strongly recommend you get

04:03.544 --> 04:04.945
an experienced lawyer.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.880
- Yeah?
Okay, new lawyer.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.317
But that means we go to trial,

04:09.317 --> 04:14.455
which means,
if you want to take me down,

04:14.455 --> 04:16.324
you're gonna have to prove it.

04:16.324 --> 04:18.492
You.
[laughs]

04:18.492 --> 04:20.193
All of you.

04:20.193 --> 04:23.897
And I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.

04:27.635 --> 04:30.237
- Can he do this?
Just change his plea.

04:30.237 --> 04:31.439
- He just did.

04:31.439 --> 04:33.140
- So what do you do now?

04:33.140 --> 04:35.376
- We'll go to trial with
our strongest case first.

04:35.376 --> 04:36.744
The kidnapping of your son.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.446
- So the evidence is fresh.

04:38.446 --> 04:42.816
And Wyatt can identify Hodda
as the man who took him.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.652
- He'd have to testify?

04:44.652 --> 04:48.221
- He would, but we will give him
the best support available.

04:48.221 --> 04:49.623
- So for killing Hector

04:49.623 --> 04:51.592
you don't even accuse this man?

04:51.592 --> 04:53.894
- The evidence is 16 years old,
and it's only circumstantial.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.062
- He confessed.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.797
- [sighs]
And he just recanted.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.532
We don't need his confession
for the kidnapping.

04:58.532 --> 05:00.968
- This is a major felony.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.270
He's going to be put
away for a long time.

05:03.270 --> 05:04.638
- No.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.039
- No what?

05:06.039 --> 05:08.108
- Wyatt's still traumatized.

05:08.108 --> 05:09.443
We won't put him through this.

05:09.443 --> 05:10.644
- Ms. Colfax.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.145
Let's just talk about this
for a second.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.447
- My ex-husband and I don't
agree on anything,

05:13.447 --> 05:14.948
but we agree on this.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.550
- And we believe that
Lewis Hodda murdered

05:16.550 --> 05:18.619
at least two other children
besides Hector.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.220
- So bring him
to trial on those.

05:20.220 --> 05:21.288
- We don't have enough evidence.

05:21.288 --> 05:22.890
He covered
his tracks with arson.

05:22.890 --> 05:25.058
[somber music]

05:25.058 --> 05:26.627
- I have to protect Wyatt.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.662
- What about my son?

05:28.662 --> 05:32.700
You would let the man who
murdered my child get away?

05:32.700 --> 05:35.168
- I'm really sorry about
what happened to your son.

05:35.168 --> 05:38.305
I really am.

05:38.305 --> 05:42.242
But my son is--

05:42.242 --> 05:43.911
I'm sorry.

05:43.911 --> 05:46.947
- Laurie...

05:53.020 --> 05:57.491
- So now, you can put him on
trial for what he did to Hector?

05:57.491 --> 05:59.059
- We'll have to.

05:59.059 --> 06:01.829
- And you can tell the jury
what he did to her son,

06:01.829 --> 06:04.164
and--and the other murders?

06:04.164 --> 06:07.435
So they'll know who that man is.

06:07.435 --> 06:10.103
- It's up to the judge.

06:10.103 --> 06:13.140
I'll do my best.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.811
[dramatic music]

07:01.522 --> 07:01.655
.

07:02.856 --> 07:03.223
- Hey, counselor!

07:04.625 --> 07:05.626
On your way to the
Hodda motion hearing?

07:05.626 --> 07:07.060
- Wish I weren't.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.095
- All right, so, listen,
you know I'm going

07:08.095 --> 07:09.396
to law school at night, right?

07:09.396 --> 07:10.498
- I've alerted
the Bar Association.

07:10.498 --> 07:11.865
- All right.

07:11.865 --> 07:12.866
And you know how I've
been talking to you

07:12.866 --> 07:14.401
about maybe shadowing?

07:14.401 --> 07:16.303
Well, I think that I could
really learn a lot on this case.

07:16.303 --> 07:17.905
- I don't know.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.973
With, uh, Rollins out,
S.V.U. is short-staffed and--

07:19.973 --> 07:21.141
- Ah, I checked with Liv.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.510
She says Thanksgiving is slow.

07:22.510 --> 07:23.944
This is the perfect time.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.145
Come on.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.514
- Fine.

07:26.514 --> 07:27.715
First lesson.
Shadows do not speak.

07:27.715 --> 07:28.882
They have no opinions.

07:28.882 --> 07:29.983
- You won't even know I'm here.

07:29.983 --> 07:33.386
- Barba,
you brought backup?

07:33.386 --> 07:34.555
- Lisa Hassler.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.156
What noble cause
brings you to court?

07:36.156 --> 07:37.390
- I'm taking over
Hodda's defense.

07:37.390 --> 07:38.391
Who's the arm candy?

07:38.391 --> 07:39.660
- Detective Carisi, SVU.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.328
- Hi.
- Night school, Fordham Law.

07:41.328 --> 07:43.163
I got to tell you, I know
all your father's cases.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.397
The Supreme Court arguments.

07:44.397 --> 07:45.666
The Black Panther defense.

07:45.666 --> 07:46.967
- You want to save
the taxpayers' money

07:46.967 --> 07:48.636
and plea this down
to time served?

07:48.636 --> 07:51.171
- I know you're the pro
bono queen, but Hodda?

07:51.171 --> 07:52.673
He rapes and kills children.

07:52.673 --> 07:56.076
- Allegedly and singular.

07:56.076 --> 08:00.548
It's nice to meet you,
Detective.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.082
- Lisa Hassler, huh?

08:02.082 --> 08:03.216
Wow.

08:03.216 --> 08:04.752
Her old man was a legend.

08:04.752 --> 08:07.054
- Yeah, she's still
trying to impress him,

08:07.054 --> 08:09.256
even though he's been
dead for 11 years.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.193
- All right, let's get to it.

08:13.193 --> 08:16.229
Ms. Hassler, you have a motion
to preclude any mention

08:16.229 --> 08:17.765
of the Wyatt Morris
kidnapping in this trial?

08:17.765 --> 08:19.399
- Yes, Your Honor.

08:19.399 --> 08:20.668
If the prosecution wants to try
Mr. Hodda on that charge,

08:20.668 --> 08:21.935
it's their right.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.236
But it's not
part of this case,

08:23.236 --> 08:24.738
so this jury shouldn't
hear about it.

08:24.738 --> 08:27.074
- If it can't be introduced,
the State's case

08:27.074 --> 08:28.576
for the murder of Hector
Rodriguez lacks context.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.077
I wouldn't be able to explain

08:30.077 --> 08:32.412
why the defendant was in
custody when he confessed.

08:32.412 --> 08:33.881
The jury would be confused.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.683
- And the State, having ground
this broken man down

08:35.683 --> 08:37.585
for three years, would rather
see the jury prejudiced.

08:37.585 --> 08:41.221
- The kidnapping goes to
the defendant's motive,

08:41.221 --> 08:43.056
his interest in young boys,

08:43.056 --> 08:47.427
and it exemplifies his common
pattern of criminal behavior.

08:47.427 --> 08:48.629
It's relevant and
it's probatative.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.598
- It's not even proven.

08:50.598 --> 08:52.099
You can't just accuse
him of other crimes

08:52.099 --> 08:53.433
to shore up a weak case.

08:53.433 --> 08:54.802
- Mr. Barba,
you have the option

08:54.802 --> 08:57.070
of trying Mr. Hodda
on the kidnapping.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.406
- Yes, Your Honor.
We are reserving that right.

08:59.406 --> 09:01.374
- Well, I'm sure you
have your reasons.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.776
But in the meantime,

09:02.776 --> 09:04.311
I'm not going to
muddy these waters.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.379
Any mention of
the kidnapping is inadmissible.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.182
- As should be Mr. Hodda's
coerced confession, Your Honor?

09:09.182 --> 09:10.217
- Coerced?

09:10.217 --> 09:11.652
The confession is on video.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.987
Why don't you let the jury
decide if it's valid?

09:13.987 --> 09:15.522
- Well, as your dad used to say,
Ms. Hassler,

09:15.522 --> 09:16.790
"Worth a shot."

09:16.790 --> 09:20.694
But the confession
is admissible.

09:20.694 --> 09:24.064
- Well, the hearing was awesome.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.899
- Uh, Barba didn't think so.

09:25.899 --> 09:29.536
- He took a hit,
but the badinage.

09:29.536 --> 09:31.739
I tell you, Hodda lucked out
with that new lawyer.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.506
- And we're supposed
to be happy for him?

09:33.506 --> 09:35.542
- No, we're not.

09:35.542 --> 09:38.078
Oh, Barba said that it would
be really good if we could find

09:38.078 --> 09:41.882
anything linking Hodda to Hector
while Hector was still alive.

09:41.882 --> 09:44.051
- We gave him everything
we have from '99.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.819
- Fin, what about
that auxiliary cop,

09:45.819 --> 09:47.721
the one that found
Hector's lunch box?

09:47.721 --> 09:49.389
I saw him at
Hodda's plea hearing.

09:49.389 --> 09:50.490
- Lomatin?

09:50.490 --> 09:51.825
He's nuts.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.661
Munch thought he was
good for the crime.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.328
- For a minute,
but he didn't do it.

09:55.328 --> 09:56.997
- He's still nuts.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.566
He's been leaving messages
for Rollins at 3:00 AM.

09:59.566 --> 10:00.734
- He knew Hector.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.402
He knew the neighborhood.

10:02.402 --> 10:05.405
He's the one who noticed
the arson pattern

10:05.405 --> 10:06.907
that got us to Hodda.

10:06.907 --> 10:09.209
- He'll only talk to Rollins.

10:09.209 --> 10:12.212
- Okay, so,
have her call him.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.049
- It was great to hear
from Detective Rollins.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.951
She said you guys wanted
to follow up with me?

10:17.951 --> 10:19.552
- Well, we're kind of
up against it here.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.254
We didn't know this
case was going to trial.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.857
- Rollins reminded us
how much you cared.

10:23.857 --> 10:26.459
- You know, every year, Hector's
mom had a little service here

10:26.459 --> 10:28.962
on the anniversary of
the day he disappeared.

10:28.962 --> 10:32.399
The last few years, no one from
the case came besides me.

10:32.399 --> 10:33.867
No one.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.336
- And no one but Officer
Lomatin noticed the pattern

10:36.336 --> 10:37.871
that got us to Hodda.

10:37.871 --> 10:41.408
Problem is, none of his other
crimes are admissible in court.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.310
- Justice can be so blind.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.778
- Did you ever see Lewis Hodda

10:44.778 --> 10:48.248
hanging around Hector
or his school?

10:48.248 --> 10:49.416
- No.

10:49.416 --> 10:50.751
But I can say I did.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.219
- Come again?

10:52.219 --> 10:54.121
- This year's my last
chance to join the PD.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.956
If it'll help get me
my real badge,

10:55.956 --> 10:58.992
I'll say whatever you guys want.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.529
- So how's it going with Carisi?

11:02.529 --> 11:04.164
- You're sure you can spare him?

11:04.164 --> 11:05.733
- If I need him back,
I'll let you know.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.134
- Please.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.501
- Olivia.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.737
- Dr. Huang.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.404
Hey.

11:11.404 --> 11:12.906
Hey, you remember ADA Barba?

11:12.906 --> 11:14.407
- We've met.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.844
- So, the FBI let you
come back to New York?

11:16.844 --> 11:18.011
- I wish.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.747
They liked me
too much in Oklahoma,

11:19.747 --> 11:21.181
I put in for early retirement.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.750
I'm consulting now.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.885
Speaking of which,
I've got to run.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.219
- Okay, well,
we'll catch up later.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.321
- Okay.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.991
- You'll definitely
see him later.

11:30.991 --> 11:34.862
Hassler hired him as her
expert forensic psychiatrist.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.596
- For what?

11:36.596 --> 11:39.199
Hodda's not insane.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.601
He gave that confession
voluntarily.

11:41.601 --> 11:43.536
Okay, it's not like we beat
him with rubber hoses.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.872
- I'm sure you didn't,

11:44.872 --> 11:47.340
but please don't sound
that defensive on the stand.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.943
Hassler's sharp,
and Huang's a hired gun now.

11:49.943 --> 11:52.980
They'll find something.

11:58.351 --> 12:01.054
Anything?
- [sighs]

12:01.054 --> 12:02.890
I've watched this whole
confession three times,

12:02.890 --> 12:04.191
and this guy is crazy,

12:04.191 --> 12:06.960
but he's not,
you know, crazy.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.395
- Thank you, Dr. Carisi.

12:08.395 --> 12:11.164
Thinking of taking up medicine
after you pass the bar?

12:11.164 --> 12:12.399
- Not tonight.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.134
I'm gonna take this care package
up to Rollins.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.804
She's still on bed rest
and she's going shacky-wacky.

12:16.804 --> 12:18.571
- You can drop it off
on your way uptown.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.140
Hector's mother takes
the stand in the morning.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.474
She could use some handholding.

12:21.474 --> 12:22.475
Also, remind her,
Benson's not gonna be

12:22.475 --> 12:23.911
in the courtroom for her.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.278
- Right, 'cause she hasn't
testified herself yet.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.147
I get it.
- Good.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.016
Go, be supportive.
She's a good woman.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.317
- Where's Delores?

12:30.317 --> 12:33.854
- Her old apartment.
She never moved...

12:33.854 --> 12:37.124
So Hector would be able to
find her if he ever came back.

12:46.834 --> 12:50.537
- I always walked
Hector to school.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.940
It's only two blocks.

12:52.940 --> 12:57.677
One day, he said that he was
a big boy, un chico grande.

12:57.677 --> 13:00.547
He wanted to go by himself.

13:00.547 --> 13:03.750
I watched until
he got to the corner.

13:03.750 --> 13:06.719
He turned and waved.

13:06.719 --> 13:08.856
I never saw him again.

13:08.856 --> 13:11.558
- Did you ever find out
what happened?

13:11.558 --> 13:14.127
- I waited a long time.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.263
I had hope.

13:16.263 --> 13:20.133
And then they dug up
that basement.

13:20.133 --> 13:24.371
Detective Benson
showed me a picture.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.306
Hector's backpack.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.541
- After Hector turned
that corner,

13:28.541 --> 13:30.210
would his path have taken him

13:30.210 --> 13:33.280
by the building that was
managed by the defendant?

13:33.280 --> 13:34.581
- Yes.

13:34.581 --> 13:38.651
I didn't know the defendant.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.120
I had no idea.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.288
- Of course you didn't.

13:41.288 --> 13:44.324
Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

13:46.493 --> 13:51.731
- Mrs. Rodriguez,
I am so sorry for your loss.

13:51.731 --> 13:53.100
- Thank you.

13:53.100 --> 13:56.904
- And I'm sorry to make you
go back over all this.

13:56.904 --> 14:02.342
But did you ever see
your son with Mr. Hodda?

14:02.342 --> 14:04.477
- No.

14:04.477 --> 14:06.479
- Did you ever see
Mr. Hodda at all

14:06.479 --> 14:08.048
before the police arrested him

14:08.048 --> 14:10.517
and told you he
had taken your son?

14:10.517 --> 14:12.252
- I don't remember.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.253
No.

14:13.253 --> 14:16.156
- I guess you were surprised

14:16.156 --> 14:17.690
that someone
who lived so close to you,

14:17.690 --> 14:21.494
whom you'd never suspected, was
suddenly accused of this crime

14:21.494 --> 14:23.530
after so many years.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.933
- Uh, I suppose so.

14:25.933 --> 14:30.570
- Over the years,
had the police told you

14:30.570 --> 14:32.605
they wanted to solve
your son's murder?

14:32.605 --> 14:34.007
- Yes.

14:34.007 --> 14:38.045
Detective Benson.
She was very dedicated.

14:38.045 --> 14:39.947
She wanted justice for Hector.

14:39.947 --> 14:42.615
- That was important to her?

14:42.615 --> 14:43.683
- Yes.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.953
She wanted to help me.

14:45.953 --> 14:47.620
And she felt bad for me.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.356
- Of course she did.

14:49.356 --> 14:52.125
And the only way to help you

14:52.125 --> 14:55.963
was to find somebody to blame
for your son's murder.

14:55.963 --> 14:56.964
- Objection.

14:56.964 --> 14:58.265
Leading the witness.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.300
- Sustained.

15:03.036 --> 15:06.073
- I think we understand it.

15:10.877 --> 15:12.645
[suspenseful music]

15:12.645 --> 15:13.981
- Hold on, Hassler did what?

15:13.981 --> 15:15.815
She made me look
too conscientious?

15:15.815 --> 15:17.384
- She implied you
were so desperate

15:17.384 --> 15:19.987
to get closure for Delores,
you manufactured a suspect.

15:19.987 --> 15:21.688
- That's ridiculous.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.023
And you let her
get away with it?

15:23.023 --> 15:24.524
- I couldn't shoot her.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.193
She's just doing her job.
She's good at it.

15:26.193 --> 15:28.795
- So you let her
hang me out to dry.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.330
- Table that.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.399
You're up after lunch.
Let's prep.

15:32.399 --> 15:33.900
- You know what?

15:33.900 --> 15:36.136
I've actually testified
a few hundred times.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.038
So I think I'll be fine.

15:38.038 --> 15:40.040
I need to get back
to the squad room.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.841
- No, you don't.

15:41.841 --> 15:44.677
Lewis Hodda might walk if
Hassler can make the jury think

15:44.677 --> 15:47.047
your emotions got in
the way of your police work,

15:47.047 --> 15:50.183
which is what they're
doing right now.

15:50.183 --> 15:54.221
I need you to sit your ass
down and work with me.

15:55.855 --> 15:57.724
- Fine.

16:06.066 --> 16:06.199
.

16:08.535 --> 16:09.036
- He had a backpack.

16:10.037 --> 16:11.304
He started talking to me.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.241
Bugging me.
- How?

16:14.241 --> 16:16.443
- Followed me back
to my building.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.545
- And?

16:18.545 --> 16:20.580
- What?

16:20.580 --> 16:23.116
- What happened?

16:23.116 --> 16:26.153
- Nothing happened.
- Well, something happened.

16:26.153 --> 16:29.289
- I'm not doing this.
I'm not--what?

16:29.289 --> 16:30.490
- I'm just asking you
what happened?

16:30.490 --> 16:32.059
- Nothing happened.

16:32.059 --> 16:34.461
- Okay.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.329
- But he said he was going to
tell his mother something did.

16:36.329 --> 16:40.333
I can't have that.
- So?

16:40.333 --> 16:42.535
- [sighs]

16:42.535 --> 16:44.104
So I snapped his neck.

16:44.104 --> 16:48.075
- So you did do it.
- Yeah.

16:51.811 --> 16:52.879
- Were you present when the
defendant made that statement?

16:54.081 --> 16:55.582
- Yes.

16:55.582 --> 16:58.651
It was voluntary, and he had
been informed of his rights.

16:58.651 --> 17:01.388
- What led you to suspect the
defendant in the first place?

17:01.388 --> 17:05.092
- We learned that, uh, fresh
concrete had been poured

17:05.092 --> 17:07.560
in the basement of a building
that he was managing

17:07.560 --> 17:10.263
a few days after
Hector disappeared.

17:10.263 --> 17:12.799
Our investigation then
turned up allegations

17:12.799 --> 17:15.802
that he was
a child molester.

17:15.802 --> 17:17.204
- What did the defendant say

17:17.204 --> 17:18.805
when you asked him
about the concrete?

17:18.805 --> 17:20.673
- That the old
floor had been

17:20.673 --> 17:23.610
damaged by water
from a nearby fire.

17:23.610 --> 17:27.114
We then determined that
the fire occurred too far away,

17:27.114 --> 17:28.448
and it was impossible
for the water

17:28.448 --> 17:29.949
to get back
to his building.

17:29.949 --> 17:32.119
- To obtain his statement,
did you or your partner

17:32.119 --> 17:35.155
apply any coercion,
physical violence, threats?

17:35.155 --> 17:37.990
- Absolutely not.

17:37.990 --> 17:41.361
- After Hector Rodriguez
disappeared in 1999,

17:41.361 --> 17:42.862
what did the police conclude?

17:42.862 --> 17:45.165
- Well, officially,
that he had been

17:45.165 --> 17:48.000
taken by his father
in a custody dispute.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.636
But I disagreed.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.938
- So the New York Police
Department was wrong,

17:51.938 --> 17:53.140
but you were right?

17:53.140 --> 17:54.541
- Unfortunately, yes.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.543
- How motivated were you
to prove you were right?

17:56.543 --> 17:58.445
- [sighs]
Not motivated enough.

17:58.445 --> 18:01.448
It took me almost a decade.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.916
- But then, finally, you had--

18:03.916 --> 18:05.918
you had Lewis Hodda in
your interrogation room.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.587
- Yes, where he confessed

18:07.587 --> 18:10.957
to murdering
a seven-year-old boy.

18:10.957 --> 18:12.725
It's on the video.

18:12.725 --> 18:17.397
- I am much more interested in
what is not on the video.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.765
So...

18:18.765 --> 18:23.170
You interrogated Lewis Hodda

18:23.170 --> 18:28.074
for over six hours
before turning on a camera.

18:28.074 --> 18:31.778
During all that time,
you didn't coerce him?

18:31.778 --> 18:33.380
You didn't threaten him?

18:33.380 --> 18:35.682
- No, I followed
police procedure.

18:35.682 --> 18:38.851
- Did you tell him that
witnesses had seen him

18:38.851 --> 18:42.522
with other children who
had been murdered?

18:42.522 --> 18:44.023
- I may have.

18:44.023 --> 18:45.858
- Was it true?

18:45.858 --> 18:48.695
- Um, the Supreme Court
has ruled that

18:48.695 --> 18:51.364
police are allowed to
make misrepresentations.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.566
- By misrepresentations
you mean lies?

18:53.566 --> 18:54.701
- Basically, yes.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.504
- So, after lying to him

18:57.504 --> 18:59.038
about these nonexistent
witnesses,

18:59.038 --> 19:02.509
didn't you tell him...

19:02.509 --> 19:04.544
and I quote...

19:06.112 --> 19:10.217
"Nobody likes a chomo
in state prison"?

19:10.217 --> 19:11.784
- Yes, but it was
a matter of urgency.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.220
The defendant had another child.

19:13.220 --> 19:14.421
- Your Honor, please
instruct the witness to

19:14.421 --> 19:15.955
answer the question only.

19:15.955 --> 19:18.691
- Lieutenant, you are flirting
with causing a mistrial.

19:18.691 --> 19:21.528
The jury will disregard.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.996
- What is a chomo, Lieutenant?

19:23.996 --> 19:25.665
- It's a child molester.

19:25.665 --> 19:28.635
- And chomos--or child
molesters--are themselves

19:28.635 --> 19:30.670
frequently assaulted
in prison, are they not?

19:30.670 --> 19:32.104
- Objection.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.707
Lieutenant Benson
is not a prison warden.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.309
- I'll allow it.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.610
- Yes, they are.

19:37.610 --> 19:40.012
- So, you lied about
having the evidence

19:40.012 --> 19:41.314
that would send him to prison

19:41.314 --> 19:43.883
and you threatened to label him
a chomo when he got there.

19:43.883 --> 19:47.387
- We had good reason to believe
that he was a child molester.

19:47.387 --> 19:48.721
- And you promised to

19:48.721 --> 19:52.091
advertise that belief
to insure he would be assaulted

19:52.091 --> 19:53.660
when he got to prison.

19:53.660 --> 19:56.696
Then, and only then,
did he confess.

19:56.696 --> 20:00.433
- He confessed
because he was guilty.

20:00.433 --> 20:04.203
- I confessed because she said
she was going to get me killed.

20:07.206 --> 20:10.477
Sorry, but that's what happens
to chomos in prison.

20:10.477 --> 20:14.013
- And what did she say would
happen if you cooperated?

20:14.013 --> 20:16.516
- That she'd put the word out
I wasn't a chomo,

20:16.516 --> 20:18.217
and so I'd be safe.

20:18.217 --> 20:21.654
- Did you believe her?

20:21.654 --> 20:24.524
- I believe
they were framing me,

20:24.524 --> 20:26.025
that they could do
whatever they wanted to,

20:26.025 --> 20:28.227
that I had to say what
they wanted me to say

20:28.227 --> 20:30.363
if I was ever going to
get out of there alive.

20:30.363 --> 20:31.531
I believed...

20:31.531 --> 20:35.568
- Did you murder
Hector Rodriguez?

20:38.004 --> 20:41.841
- I never saw
that little--

20:41.841 --> 20:44.677
I never saw that little boy
before in my life.

20:44.677 --> 20:47.414
- Do you have
any idea why his body

20:47.414 --> 20:49.782
was found in a building
you managed?

20:49.782 --> 20:51.351
- Well, that building
was full of--

20:51.351 --> 20:54.587
of ex-cons,

20:54.587 --> 20:57.023
welfare cheats,
drug addicts.

20:57.023 --> 20:58.525
The whole neighborhood
was like a war zone.

20:58.525 --> 20:59.526
I don't even know
where to begin.

20:59.526 --> 21:00.527
It was terrible.

21:00.527 --> 21:06.466
- Thank you, Mr. Hodda.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.435
- You were the manager of
the building, though.

21:08.435 --> 21:12.004
Did you order the concrete
or did the drug addicts?

21:12.004 --> 21:13.205
- I did.

21:13.205 --> 21:18.144
- Because a fire
200 yards away

21:18.144 --> 21:21.548
resulted in water flowing uphill
toward your building.

21:21.548 --> 21:23.215
- I don't remember.

21:23.215 --> 21:26.018
Building needed new concrete,
I got it new concrete.

21:26.018 --> 21:29.155
- Okay, you don't remember that,
but you do remember this.

21:29.155 --> 21:30.357
- He had a backpack.

21:30.357 --> 21:31.491
He started talking to me.

21:31.491 --> 21:34.361
Bugging me.

21:34.361 --> 21:36.396
Followed me back
to my building.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.231
- You remembered that
he had a backpack.

21:39.231 --> 21:41.033
- Kids have backpacks, okay?

21:41.033 --> 21:42.635
- Did you put the backpack
into the ground with Hector

21:42.635 --> 21:44.671
when you buried him?

21:46.706 --> 21:48.375
- No.

21:48.375 --> 21:51.378
- You remember laying your hands
on Hector Rodriguez?

21:51.378 --> 21:53.413
- There's nothing to remember.
I never did that.

21:53.413 --> 21:54.581
- You were sexually attracted
to him, weren't you?

21:54.581 --> 21:55.982
- No.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.884
- Why were you repeatedly
found hanging around

21:57.884 --> 21:59.819
children's playgrounds in the
years after Hector was murdered?

21:59.819 --> 22:01.888
- I wasn't.
That's one of her lies.

22:01.888 --> 22:03.456
- No, it wasn't.

22:03.456 --> 22:07.427
People's exhibit 6A and B.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.161
Police reports.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.162
- Uh, so what?

22:10.162 --> 22:11.163
Playgrounds are parks.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.432
I like--I go to parks.

22:12.432 --> 22:13.833
- I like parks too.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.403
I don't hang around
staring at little boys.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.439
- Now you're doing
what she did.

22:19.439 --> 22:20.740
Putting out that lie.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.409
- What lie?

22:22.409 --> 22:24.310
You hang out at playgrounds.

22:24.310 --> 22:25.745
A little boy
was found dead

22:25.745 --> 22:26.846
in the basement of
your building.

22:26.846 --> 22:29.882
You said you killed him.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.120
- I told you why I said that.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.655
- You told me what?
Because you were afraid?

22:35.655 --> 22:37.857
Because you were afraid
of being hurt in prison?

22:37.857 --> 22:39.325
Or because you were afraid

22:39.325 --> 22:40.760
of hearing the truth
about yourself,

22:40.760 --> 22:42.795
which is you like little boys?

22:44.597 --> 22:47.266
- [chuckles]
I'm not afraid of anything.

22:47.266 --> 22:48.735
- Then tell me,
where exactly did you

22:48.735 --> 22:51.103
put your hands
on Hector Rodriguez?

22:51.103 --> 22:53.139
- I never touched him
down there, never, I--

22:53.139 --> 22:54.941
- You never touched
him down there?

22:54.941 --> 22:57.977
Where did you touch him then?

22:59.311 --> 23:01.448
- [indistinct stutter]

23:01.448 --> 23:04.451
[tense music]

23:04.451 --> 23:07.520
*

23:07.520 --> 23:09.055
- Hey, nice cross, Counselor.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.056
- Little boys.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.123
Thank you.
It was a tell.

23:11.123 --> 23:12.191
- Yeah, but what
you did with it.

23:12.191 --> 23:13.593
If that had been
a boxing match,

23:13.593 --> 23:15.027
they would have thrown
in the towel right there.

23:15.027 --> 23:17.063
- Are you gloating?

23:17.063 --> 23:18.465
- Guilty.

23:18.465 --> 23:20.567
- Nothing makes me happier
than to see a member

23:20.567 --> 23:22.602
of the patriarchy
strut before he falls.

23:22.602 --> 23:24.804
- Hmm, I seem to be on my feet.

23:24.804 --> 23:28.074
I'd say your client just made
quite an impression on the jury.

23:36.483 --> 23:36.583
.

23:37.349 --> 23:38.184
- I would describe
Lewis Hodda as scarred.

23:39.486 --> 23:41.754
He was physically abused
by an alcoholic father

23:41.754 --> 23:43.089
and never resolved
his fear of him,

23:43.089 --> 23:45.592
and he compensated
by taking pride

23:45.592 --> 23:48.861
in impulsive physical behavior
and macho posturing.

23:48.861 --> 23:51.263
- Dr. Huang, why would
such a person admit

23:51.263 --> 23:52.932
to a crime he didn't commit?

23:52.932 --> 23:54.801
- Well, the only way that
he could avoid beatings

23:54.801 --> 23:56.936
was to do what
his father demanded.

23:56.936 --> 24:00.106
And so, if another authority
figure were to threaten him,

24:00.106 --> 24:02.341
he might respond by
doing what that person wanted.

24:02.341 --> 24:04.677
- Do you mean an authority
figure like a police detective?

24:04.677 --> 24:06.513
- That would qualify.

24:06.513 --> 24:07.814
- Who threatened to harm him by
tossing him in prison

24:07.814 --> 24:09.516
with the label
of child molester?

24:09.516 --> 24:11.718
- That threat would be
particularly potent to someone

24:11.718 --> 24:15.321
clinging onto the idea of
himself as hyper-masculine.

24:15.321 --> 24:16.856
- What if someone like
an Assistant District Attorney

24:16.856 --> 24:18.057
insisted that he was
attracted to little boys?

24:18.057 --> 24:19.859
- Your Honor.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.761
- We all saw it.
It happened.

24:21.761 --> 24:23.730
- Rephrase the question.

24:23.730 --> 24:25.765
- What if an authority figure

24:25.765 --> 24:28.034
publicly insisted
that Mr. Hodda

24:28.034 --> 24:29.902
was attracted to little boys?

24:29.902 --> 24:33.940
- That assertion would be
the psychological equivalent

24:33.940 --> 24:36.342
of the strap that his father
beat him with.

24:36.342 --> 24:37.910
- So he might say
whatever he thought

24:37.910 --> 24:39.145
that official wanted him to say?

24:39.145 --> 24:42.114
- Well, if his emotional
defenses were breached,

24:42.114 --> 24:44.383
it could trigger
that kind of compliance.

24:44.383 --> 24:48.187
- So to avoid being beaten
by an accusation

24:48.187 --> 24:50.056
he feared and hated,

24:50.056 --> 24:54.226
might he admit to touching
a child he'd never even met?

24:54.226 --> 24:55.862
- Objection.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.564
We are now beyond hypothetical.

24:57.564 --> 24:58.898
- Dr. Huang is
an expert witness.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.299
I'm asking for
his expert opinion.

25:00.299 --> 25:02.401
- Overruled.

25:06.472 --> 25:08.107
- Dr. Huang?

25:08.107 --> 25:09.842
- Yes.

25:09.842 --> 25:12.879
Mr. Hodda might say anything.

25:15.982 --> 25:19.018
[elevator dings]

25:24.490 --> 25:25.825
- Huang.

25:25.825 --> 25:27.059
- Olivia.

25:27.059 --> 25:28.828
- What the hell were
you doing up there?

25:28.828 --> 25:29.829
- Testifying.

25:29.829 --> 25:31.230
- For that man?

25:31.230 --> 25:34.133
You and I used to put
people like that away.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.068
You know what he did to Hector.

25:36.068 --> 25:37.604
What he did to Wyatt.

25:37.604 --> 25:40.006
- To Wyatt, yes.
But to Hector, I don't know.

25:40.006 --> 25:41.874
- So you think I coerced him?

25:41.874 --> 25:43.643
Is that what you think?

25:43.643 --> 25:45.712
How long have we
known each other?

25:45.712 --> 25:48.180
- Olivia, he's suggestible.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.716
It may not have
been your intent,

25:49.716 --> 25:51.483
but if you planted an idea,
he might have believed it.

25:51.483 --> 25:53.653
- He believed it
because he did it!

25:53.653 --> 25:56.756
- I'm sorry,
but I don't know that,

25:56.756 --> 25:58.224
and neither do you.

25:58.224 --> 26:01.260
[elevator dings]

26:11.070 --> 26:14.240
- It was Stephen Lomatin,
a young auxiliary officer,

26:14.240 --> 26:16.643
who first discovered
the missing boy's lunch box.

26:16.643 --> 26:18.678
Stephen, how emotional
was it for you

26:18.678 --> 26:20.346
when you made that discovery?

26:20.346 --> 26:21.948
- Uh, it was very emotional.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.482
This job can be very emotional.

26:23.482 --> 26:24.817
You feel like you're looking

26:24.817 --> 26:28.087
for a member of
your own family.

26:28.087 --> 26:32.491
- So, when Hector Rodriguez
disappeared in 1999,

26:32.491 --> 26:34.694
you were the one who
found his lunch box?

26:34.694 --> 26:35.995
- Yes, I was.

26:35.995 --> 26:37.997
- Hundreds of people looking,

26:37.997 --> 26:40.667
and you were
the one who found it.

26:40.667 --> 26:42.034
- I was trained by the NYPD.

26:42.034 --> 26:43.102
And I have good eyes.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.672
- [chuckles]
Good eyes.

26:45.672 --> 26:49.441
You didn't--you didn't find it
because you knew where to look?

26:49.441 --> 26:50.710
- No.
How would I?

26:50.710 --> 26:51.711
- That's what
I've been wondering.

26:51.711 --> 26:52.712
- Objection.

26:52.712 --> 26:54.513
- Sustained.
Ms. Hassler.

26:54.513 --> 26:57.483
- You'd--you'd often...

26:57.483 --> 26:59.518
spoken with Hector,
isn't that right?

26:59.518 --> 27:03.089
- I was friendly with
all the kids up there.

27:03.089 --> 27:04.356
- How friendly?

27:04.356 --> 27:05.958
- I resent these implications.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.060
- Oh, I'm--I'm sure you do.

27:08.060 --> 27:12.431
Did you resent it when
SVU Sergeant John Munch

27:12.431 --> 27:14.233
interrogated you
about this case?

27:14.233 --> 27:15.702
- It wasn't an interrogation.

27:15.702 --> 27:17.569
I was discussing aspects
of the case with him.

27:17.569 --> 27:19.371
- You didn't take offense when
he considered you a suspect?

27:19.371 --> 27:20.707
- Objection.
No foundation.

27:20.707 --> 27:22.809
- Uh, sustained.
Jury will disregard.

27:22.809 --> 27:24.010
- Thank you, Your Honor.

27:24.010 --> 27:26.278
Because that guy Munch,
he was a conspiracy nut.

27:26.278 --> 27:28.114
His own captain
apologized to me.

27:28.114 --> 27:29.749
So did the other detectives.

27:29.749 --> 27:31.784
- You mean the ones
who found pictures of

27:31.784 --> 27:34.620
Hector Rodriguez
all over your attic?

27:34.620 --> 27:37.323
Defense exhibit 13C.

27:37.323 --> 27:41.427
Photos of Mr. Lomatin's attic.

27:41.427 --> 27:44.430
[tense music]

27:44.430 --> 27:46.933
*

27:46.933 --> 27:52.338
So...this looks like
the work of a man obsessed.

27:52.338 --> 27:53.973
- I was doing research.

27:53.973 --> 27:56.142
- For 13 years?

27:56.142 --> 27:59.245
You visited Hector's mother.

27:59.245 --> 28:00.512
You went to his memorial.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.513
- Objection.

28:01.513 --> 28:02.982
Is there a question?

28:02.982 --> 28:04.516
- Yes.

28:04.516 --> 28:08.087
*

28:08.087 --> 28:11.323
How long have you been
taking anti-psychotic drugs?

28:11.323 --> 28:12.925
- Objection.
Relevance.

28:12.925 --> 28:14.994
- Sustained.

28:14.994 --> 28:16.929
- Thank you, Your Honor.

28:16.929 --> 28:19.598
I just care about children,

28:19.598 --> 28:21.167
even when no one else does.

28:21.167 --> 28:23.903
- So you have a special
relationship with children?

28:23.903 --> 28:27.073
- Not like that.

28:27.073 --> 28:29.541
- Did you murder
Hector Rodriguez?

28:29.541 --> 28:31.778
- Judge, this is ridiculous.
There's the guy who did it!

28:31.778 --> 28:33.545
Right there!

28:33.545 --> 28:36.883
- Mr. Lomatin,
just answer the question.

28:36.883 --> 28:38.417
- I will not dignify
that question

28:38.417 --> 28:42.188
with an answer,
Your Honor.

28:42.188 --> 28:45.291
- I'm not hearing a no.

28:45.291 --> 28:51.230
*

28:51.230 --> 28:52.799
- And so,

28:52.799 --> 28:57.303
there can only be
only one logical conclusion.

28:58.938 --> 29:01.808
From the physical evidence
of this horrible crime,

29:01.808 --> 29:04.543
as well as from his own words,

29:04.543 --> 29:08.614
you must find the defendant
Lewis Hodda

29:08.614 --> 29:10.817
guilty.

29:10.817 --> 29:13.152
Thank you.

29:13.152 --> 29:16.622
- Members of the jury, that
concludes the closing arguments,

29:16.622 --> 29:21.327
which means it's time for you
to begin your deliberations.

29:21.327 --> 29:24.296
As you do, remember
that the defendant

29:24.296 --> 29:26.632
is presumed to be innocent.

29:26.632 --> 29:29.335
You must find
the defendant not guilty,

29:29.335 --> 29:31.037
unless you conclude

29:31.037 --> 29:33.172
the People have
proven him guilty

29:33.172 --> 29:35.241
beyond a reasonable doubt.

29:35.241 --> 29:39.578
With that in mind, this case
is now in your hands.

29:39.578 --> 29:42.614
Godspeed.

29:43.850 --> 29:46.886
[indistinct chattering]

29:51.157 --> 29:52.859
- The fact that the jurors
are taking their time

29:52.859 --> 29:55.161
means the jury's taking
their duty very seriously.

29:55.161 --> 29:56.762
- It's been two days already.

29:56.762 --> 29:58.931
What issues are
they grappling with?

29:58.931 --> 30:01.500
- Mainly, the weakness of
the People's case, which relies

30:01.500 --> 30:05.071
almost solely on a confession
extorted by police threats.

30:05.071 --> 30:06.505
- She's still making her case.

30:06.505 --> 30:09.608
- The jurors aren't supposed
to watch the news.

30:09.608 --> 30:11.443
- More and more cases
of police officers

30:11.443 --> 30:12.979
who are out of control...

30:12.979 --> 30:14.780
They abuse power.

30:14.780 --> 30:19.051
We just need some more policies
in places like this that do it.

30:19.051 --> 30:21.020
- Why don't you help
people who deserve it?

30:21.020 --> 30:22.855
That man killed my boy.

30:22.855 --> 30:24.290
- Okay, Mrs. Rodriguez,
it's all right.

30:24.290 --> 30:25.624
- He killed my boy.
- It's all right.

30:25.624 --> 30:27.059
- Delores.
- Not now, not now.

30:27.059 --> 30:28.861
- Delores.
- Not now.

30:28.861 --> 30:30.296
- Mr. Barba, any comment?

30:30.296 --> 30:31.864
- Uh, the People have
complete confidence

30:31.864 --> 30:33.432
in the common sense
of the jurors.

30:39.939 --> 30:40.072
.

30:43.642 --> 30:43.910
- Anything?

30:45.044 --> 30:47.246
- Nope.
Five days.

30:47.246 --> 30:49.315
- Hector's mother is
barely holding it together.

30:49.315 --> 30:50.716
Liv's with her.

30:50.716 --> 30:52.118
You still studying?
- No.

30:52.118 --> 30:54.453
Check this out.
The jurors' social media.

30:54.453 --> 30:56.222
Juror Number One,
the forewoman.

30:56.222 --> 30:57.289
Name's Sharon Daley.

30:57.289 --> 30:58.824
She's been posting
for months about

30:58.824 --> 31:02.028
this big family reunion
she's having at Thanksgiving.

31:02.028 --> 31:03.829
- Holiday's coming
and the jury's stuck

31:03.829 --> 31:05.164
in a hotel on Staten Island.

31:05.164 --> 31:06.632
- Yeah, they all got to be
dying to get out of there.

31:06.632 --> 31:09.936
[phone vibrating]
- Hold on.

31:09.936 --> 31:12.304
Hey, what's up, Amanda?

31:12.304 --> 31:14.073
Yeah?

31:14.073 --> 31:16.108
Oh, hold on.
I'll come get you.

31:16.108 --> 31:17.476
- What, the baby coming?

31:17.476 --> 31:19.478
- Something's happening.
Doctor wants to check on her.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.547
You cool holding down the fort?
- Yeah, yeah, go.

31:21.547 --> 31:22.949
[text alert chiming]
I'm good, I'm good.

31:22.949 --> 31:25.217
I want to be close in case
the jury comes back anyway...

31:25.217 --> 31:27.019
Which they just did.

31:27.019 --> 31:29.055
- Happy Thanksgiving.

31:37.429 --> 31:39.365
- Verdict?

31:39.365 --> 31:41.233
- Madam Forewoman,
I received your note.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.769
You have a question?
- Not me, Your Honor.

31:43.769 --> 31:46.038
One of the other jurors.

31:46.038 --> 31:50.276
- Actually, a few of us want
to hear the rules again

31:50.276 --> 31:53.312
for deciding if
a confession is voluntary.

31:53.312 --> 31:55.047
- Very well.

31:55.047 --> 31:57.716
Under our law,
a statement is not voluntary

31:57.716 --> 31:59.251
if it is obtained by use

31:59.251 --> 32:01.420
or the threatened use
of physical force

32:01.420 --> 32:04.823
or by any other improper
conduct or undue pressure.

32:04.823 --> 32:06.525
For example,

32:06.525 --> 32:09.195
what the police promised
or said to the defendant,

32:09.195 --> 32:11.597
the defendant's treatment
during the period of detention

32:11.597 --> 32:12.831
and questioning,

32:12.831 --> 32:15.734
and the amount of time
or the length of time

32:15.734 --> 32:17.536
of the defendant's questioning.

32:17.536 --> 32:20.239
[tense music]

32:20.239 --> 32:22.174
- Undue pressure?
That chomo business.

32:22.174 --> 32:23.642
I can't believe they're
using that against you.

32:23.642 --> 32:24.876
- They don't know
the whole story.

32:24.876 --> 32:26.345
Hodda had kidnapped
another boy.

32:26.345 --> 32:28.514
I had to get him to
tell me where he was.

32:28.514 --> 32:30.649
- I get it.
Totally.

32:30.649 --> 32:33.419
- Give us a sec.

32:33.419 --> 32:34.820
- I keep going over
it in my head.

32:34.820 --> 32:37.423
- Liv? Liv?

32:37.423 --> 32:39.558
He'd kidnapped another child.

32:39.558 --> 32:42.261
You had to get him to
tell you where Wyatt was.

32:42.261 --> 32:44.030
- I know.
[phone vibrates]

32:44.030 --> 32:46.332
I know.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.367
Hey, Fin, what's going on?

32:50.236 --> 32:52.104
Is she all right?

32:52.104 --> 32:54.040
- Doc says the heart rate
slowed up,

32:54.040 --> 32:55.841
so they put Amanda on a monitor.

32:55.841 --> 32:58.777
Right now, it's just
watch and wait.

32:58.777 --> 33:00.046
Hold on.

33:00.046 --> 33:01.880
You want to talk to Liv?

33:01.880 --> 33:03.915
- Maybe later.

33:03.915 --> 33:05.451
- Maybe a little later.

33:05.451 --> 33:08.854
Is it cool if
I stay for a while?

33:08.854 --> 33:11.790
Okay, I'll keep you posted.
- [exhales slowly]

33:11.790 --> 33:13.459
- You okay?
You need anything?

33:13.459 --> 33:16.495
- Yeah, I'll just feel
better when this is over.

33:18.297 --> 33:19.865
- Mr. Barba!

33:19.865 --> 33:21.700
I've been trying to reach you.
I left seven messages.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.069
- Oh, well, there's
nothing to talk about.

33:23.069 --> 33:24.436
The case has already
gone to the jury.

33:24.436 --> 33:26.138
- Oh no, that's the thing,
one of the jurors,

33:26.138 --> 33:27.773
Juror Number Four,
Thomas Johnson, he lied.

33:27.773 --> 33:30.309
- Wait, how do you--
how did you know his name?

33:30.309 --> 33:32.144
- I gave a court clerk 50 bucks.

33:32.144 --> 33:34.780
- You commit--
you bribed a court clerk?

33:34.780 --> 33:36.215
- I checked Johnson out.

33:36.215 --> 33:38.217
He was arrested in Maryland
for assault last year.

33:38.217 --> 33:40.086
The charges were dropped,
but he lost his job.

33:40.086 --> 33:41.887
- Okay, well, there must be
10,000 Thomas Johnsons.

33:41.887 --> 33:43.089
- No, no, no.
It's him, it's him.

33:43.089 --> 33:44.223
I went to his house
in my uniform

33:44.223 --> 33:45.324
and I talked to his sister.

33:45.324 --> 33:46.458
It's him.
He's on the jury,

33:46.458 --> 33:48.094
and he doesn't like cops.

33:48.094 --> 33:49.461
- You committed bribery,

33:49.461 --> 33:51.197
impersonated a real
police officer,

33:51.197 --> 33:52.464
and you tampered with a juror?

33:52.464 --> 33:54.200
- He could be in
that room right now,

33:54.200 --> 33:56.302
poisoning the entire jury.

33:56.302 --> 33:57.403
Okay, you have to
tell the judge.

33:57.403 --> 33:58.504
- And ask for what?

33:58.504 --> 33:59.905
A mistrial?

33:59.905 --> 34:02.108
It's too late to bring
in an alternate.

34:03.942 --> 34:05.811
- I didn't know that.

34:05.811 --> 34:07.646
I should have acted faster,
but I did find it out.

34:07.646 --> 34:09.981
You'll tell the NYPD
what I did, won't you?

34:09.981 --> 34:13.018
- Oh, yeah.
You can count on it.

34:17.656 --> 34:19.791
- How much do you want reread?

34:19.791 --> 34:22.261
- Again, not me, Your Honor.

34:22.261 --> 34:25.164
One of us wants to hear
Lieutenant Benson's testimony,

34:25.164 --> 34:28.567
as well as the defendant's
and the psychiatrist's.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.136
- All of it?

34:30.136 --> 34:33.305
- I'm not really sure
what good it will do.

34:33.305 --> 34:34.806
- Excuse me.

34:34.806 --> 34:38.444
I'm not the only one
who would benefit from this.

34:38.444 --> 34:40.579
- Every juror has the right.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.615
The court reporter will begin.

34:48.154 --> 34:51.190
- We need to talk.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.496
We've both had our fun.
It's time to end this.

34:57.496 --> 34:58.964
- It's almost Thanksgiving.

34:58.964 --> 34:59.965
They're going to
come in with a verdict.

34:59.965 --> 35:02.168
- Yeah, but which one?

35:02.168 --> 35:04.035
Does he need to be here?

35:04.035 --> 35:05.604
- To chaperone, yes.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.440
What do you want to talk about?

35:08.440 --> 35:10.576
- My client will take a plea.

35:10.576 --> 35:12.544
- He agreed to a plea once
before and changed his mind.

35:12.544 --> 35:14.045
- Yeah, but it
wasn't a good plea.

35:14.045 --> 35:15.781
- And a good plea would be?

35:15.781 --> 35:17.449
- Criminally negligent homicide.

35:17.449 --> 35:19.551
- Are you kidding?
- Shush.

35:19.551 --> 35:20.686
How much time?

35:20.686 --> 35:21.687
- Eight years?

35:21.687 --> 35:22.888
- She started with three.

35:22.888 --> 35:24.055
- Eight years for
killing my baby?

35:24.055 --> 35:25.056
- You've got to say no.

35:25.056 --> 35:26.525
- I'm going to say yes.

35:26.525 --> 35:28.627
Juries that stay out
this long don't convict.

35:28.627 --> 35:30.429
- Then why did Hassler
offer anything?

35:30.429 --> 35:31.930
- Because juries are
unpredictable, you never know.

35:31.930 --> 35:33.098
- You just said--
- I know.

35:33.098 --> 35:34.733
I don't know.
Nobody knows.

35:34.733 --> 35:36.034
- Then why did you
invite us here

35:36.034 --> 35:37.035
if you'd already made up
your mind?

35:37.035 --> 35:38.870
- To try to make you understand.

35:38.870 --> 35:41.873
Mainly you, Senora Rodriguez.

35:41.873 --> 35:44.310
Por favor.
Entiendes.

35:44.310 --> 35:46.545
I've done the best I could.

35:46.545 --> 35:49.281
- No, I know you have.

35:49.281 --> 35:52.584
It's just that man.
I--

35:52.584 --> 35:55.787
If you think
that this is best, I--

35:55.787 --> 35:58.490
Okay.

35:58.490 --> 36:01.293
Okay.

36:01.293 --> 36:05.030
- So, I understand
you've reached a deal.

36:05.030 --> 36:06.732
- We have, Your Honor.

36:06.732 --> 36:08.867
- Can't say I'm surprised.

36:08.867 --> 36:10.302
You want to tell me what it is?

36:10.302 --> 36:11.837
- Well.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.872
- Ah.

36:18.244 --> 36:20.246
From the jury again.

36:20.246 --> 36:21.513
- Another question?

36:21.513 --> 36:24.416
- No.
They're deadlocked.

36:24.416 --> 36:26.585
They claim it's hopeless.

36:26.585 --> 36:28.254
- Hopeless?

36:28.254 --> 36:30.055
- Huh.

36:30.055 --> 36:32.391
- We still have a deal.

36:32.391 --> 36:35.694
- Do we?

36:35.694 --> 36:38.163
You should have
said yes earlier.

36:38.163 --> 36:40.766
Deal's off.

36:40.766 --> 36:43.535
[suspenseful music]

36:51.410 --> 36:51.610
.

36:51.643 --> 36:52.744
- If this is about the upcoming
holiday, you have a duty.

36:54.780 --> 36:56.282
- It's not that.

36:56.282 --> 36:58.350
People are getting angry.

36:58.350 --> 37:01.920
It's getting very tense.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.323
- Physical intimidation
is not allowed.

37:04.323 --> 37:06.992
If there's a problem, you should
speak to a court officer.

37:06.992 --> 37:08.994
- I'm sorry.

37:08.994 --> 37:11.129
We've really tried.

37:11.129 --> 37:13.164
There isn't any point.

37:15.634 --> 37:17.102
- Very well.

37:17.102 --> 37:20.071
If that's where we are,

37:20.071 --> 37:22.574
I'm declaring a mistrial.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.676
Defendant's remand continues

37:24.676 --> 37:27.513
while the State decides
how it wants to proceed.

37:27.513 --> 37:30.682
The jury is dismissed
and the court is adjourned.

37:30.682 --> 37:31.683
[gavel knocking]

37:31.683 --> 37:34.686
[tense music]

37:34.686 --> 37:42.728
*

37:52.604 --> 37:55.474
- What does that mean,
"while the State decides"?

37:55.474 --> 37:57.443
- We can retry Hodda.

37:57.443 --> 38:00.211
- A-and do this all over again?

38:00.211 --> 38:02.681
Will it turn out any different?

38:02.681 --> 38:04.650
- Mrs. Rodriguez.

38:04.650 --> 38:05.851
- Excuse us.

38:05.851 --> 38:07.653
- I just want to say
I'm so sorry.

38:07.653 --> 38:08.820
- We all are.

38:08.820 --> 38:10.055
At least most of us.

38:10.055 --> 38:11.723
That man is evil.

38:11.723 --> 38:13.625
It was plain as day.

38:13.625 --> 38:14.960
- And you were very brave.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.828
- What the hell happened
in that jury room?

38:16.828 --> 38:19.030
- Well, one of the jurors
thought Lomatin was guilty.

38:19.030 --> 38:21.367
- And two were worried
the confession was coerced.

38:21.367 --> 38:23.201
I'm sorry, Liv.

38:23.201 --> 38:25.371
- You are going to
try him again?

38:25.371 --> 38:26.705
This cannot end here.

38:26.705 --> 38:28.574
- It shouldn't.
And we'll see.

38:28.574 --> 38:30.275
- Some of the jurors
would like to, uh,

38:30.275 --> 38:32.010
light a candle
for Hector tonight.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.011
Is that okay?

38:33.011 --> 38:34.546
- Of course.

38:34.546 --> 38:36.181
- Okay.
And thank you, Mr. Barba.

38:36.181 --> 38:39.217
I-I-I know how hard
you tried.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.055
- You guys going up
to the memorial?

38:44.055 --> 38:45.724
- No. I'm going to spell
Fin at the hospital,

38:45.724 --> 38:47.493
keep Rollins company.

38:47.493 --> 38:50.496
- Liv, how about
we go up together?

38:50.496 --> 38:52.531
- Yeah, I-I'll, uh--
I'll meet you there.

39:30.436 --> 39:31.603
- Hi.

39:31.603 --> 39:38.544
*

39:38.544 --> 39:41.146
- I'm so sorry.

39:41.146 --> 39:42.981
- He's getting away with it.

39:42.981 --> 39:44.783
- No, he won't.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.885
I spoke with my ex-husband

39:46.885 --> 39:48.520
and Wyatt.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.355
And we all want to help.

39:50.355 --> 39:53.124
We'll cooperate.

39:53.124 --> 39:55.594
We'll go to trial.
All right?

39:55.594 --> 40:03.635

40:05.571 --> 40:07.205
- Carisi, go home.

40:07.205 --> 40:08.840
Fin will be back here soon.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.976
- Yeah, well, I'll wait
till he gets here, okay?

40:10.976 --> 40:12.410
You want some more ice chips?

40:12.410 --> 40:13.679
- Uh-uh.

40:13.679 --> 40:15.180
- Hey, how's it going?

40:15.180 --> 40:16.414
- We're getting pretty close.

40:16.414 --> 40:17.816
Contractions are
five minutes apart, so...

40:17.816 --> 40:19.384
- Yeah?

40:19.384 --> 40:21.019
- Hey Amanda,
how you holding up?

40:21.019 --> 40:22.854
- I'm tired and
it hurts like hell.

40:22.854 --> 40:24.656
And they say it's too
late for an epidural.

40:24.656 --> 40:26.558
- Oh.

40:26.558 --> 40:28.727
- Oh.

40:28.727 --> 40:29.728
[groans]

40:29.728 --> 40:30.729
- Okay, here we go.

40:30.729 --> 40:32.197
Just breathe, you got this.

40:32.197 --> 40:34.332
- [groans]
- Yeah, I know, I know.

40:34.332 --> 40:35.433
You're doing great, Amanda.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.702
- [screams]

40:37.703 --> 40:39.337
[wailing]

40:39.337 --> 40:41.406
No, no, no.
That is not a contraction.

40:41.406 --> 40:44.876
That's not a contraction.
It's in my back.

40:44.876 --> 40:46.878
[wailing]
It was my back.

40:46.878 --> 40:49.114
[monitor alerting]
It was the drug.

40:49.114 --> 40:50.215
- Okay, hang on.
- This is the drug.

40:50.215 --> 40:51.883
- We need a doctor in here.
- Help!

40:51.883 --> 40:53.519
- Just hang on, we're gonna get
a doctor in here right now.

40:53.519 --> 40:56.555
Hey.
- [wailing]

40:58.123 --> 41:00.692
- What? What is it?

41:00.692 --> 41:02.694
No, is that blood?

41:02.694 --> 41:04.162
- We're going to
take care of you.

41:04.162 --> 41:06.331
Dr. Sloan! Dr. Sloan!

41:06.331 --> 41:07.666
- They're going to get
a doctor right now, okay?

41:07.666 --> 41:09.167
- She's hemorrhaging.

41:09.167 --> 41:10.702
The fetal heart rate
is decelerating.

41:10.702 --> 41:12.838
- I need you to step out.
Now.

41:12.838 --> 41:15.206
[monitor alerting]

41:15.206 --> 41:17.142
- What is it?
