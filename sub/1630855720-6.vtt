<i>Aftermath. After. Math. Noun.</i>

00:36.828 --> 00:40.415
<i>Definition, the consequences
or aftereffects of</i>

00:40.415 --> 00:43.085
<i>a significant, unpleasant event.</i>

01:16.118 --> 01:18.328
<i>"They told you to ditch the phone.</i>

01:18.328 --> 01:22.165
<i>Can you really quit me? The only one

01:22.666 --> 01:26.128
<i>They bathe it at dusk.
They hide it with guile.</i>

01:26.128 --> 01:29.339
<i>At home in the forest,
forever lost in the wild.</i>

01:30.340 --> 01:33.719
<i>They bathe it at dusk.
They hide it with guile.</i>

01:33.719 --> 01:37.222
<i>At home in the forest,

01:38.390 --> 01:40.601
<i>...passengers,
this is the final call for boarding,</i>

01:40.601 --> 01:43.228
<i>New York City Ferry at Pier 16.</i>

01:44.146 --> 01:45.981
<i>All passengers, make your way to the gate.</i>

01:47.316 --> 01:51.028
<i>Once again, this is the final call
for boarding for New York City Ferry...</i>

02:11.965 --> 02:15.052
Emma? Emma.

02:24.978 --> 02:25.979
Come on.

02:33.904 --> 02:34.905
We're gonna make it.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.757
It's time. They're ready for you.

02:54.424 --> 02:59.346
This is the only shot you've got
to figure out if any of it is real or...

03:00.848 --> 03:02.432
Or if I'm just like Mom?

03:05.978 --> 03:11.024
Don't doubt me. Come with me. Come see.

03:11.024 --> 03:14.278
You know what she said.
You have to go alone.

03:14.278 --> 03:16.530
- Please, Kim. Come with me.
- Listen.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.990
- I've gotta let you go...
- No.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.950
...to get you back, Emma.

03:19.950 --> 03:23.996
Please, Kim. Please.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.040
I can't let you burn for this.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.507
I love you!

05:45.804 --> 05:46.805
Welcome.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.223
What happened to my son?

05:48.223 --> 05:50.142
- Come with me.
- Don't touch me.

05:52.186 --> 05:53.187
Where is he?

05:54.980 --> 05:59.276
What did you see
after you did what was asked of you?

06:00.277 --> 06:01.653
You know what I saw.

06:02.154 --> 06:03.197
And then you knew finally.

06:04.656 --> 06:07.576
You weren't crazy.
You'd been right all along.

06:07.576 --> 06:10.662
What good does being right do
if I still don't know where my child is?

06:10.662 --> 06:14.458
It removes the torment.
The illusion of his being here.

06:14.458 --> 06:18.086
He is here. I feel him.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.672
I just need you to tell me where.

06:21.340 --> 06:23.258
We all think of our children as special.

06:23.258 --> 06:24.593
Fuck you.

06:24.593 --> 06:30.432
You told me that
if I got rid of that thing,

06:31.767 --> 06:35.687
all would become clear.
I would get a second chance.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.940
A second chance at your life.

06:38.565 --> 06:41.068
Every woman here has felt the same way.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.028
- We all empathize.
- I'm going back.

06:43.737 --> 06:47.324
I have to ask you not to put the women
and children of this island in danger

06:47.324 --> 06:49.493
by exposing us to the outside world.

06:51.203 --> 06:53.580
Are you asking me or telling me?

06:55.249 --> 06:56.250
A little of both.

06:57.251 --> 07:03.924
You have your people take me back
to the city right now.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.219
I'm afraid that won't do.
To have you go back

07:07.219 --> 07:08.512
when you're like this--

07:09.304 --> 07:10.848
Let me go.

07:16.228 --> 07:17.980
Make her rest for a while.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.691
Let me go.

07:39.126 --> 07:42.337
I will find you. I will find you.

07:48.302 --> 07:52.389
You motherfuckers! You motherfuckers.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.349
Don't you dare touch--

07:57.019 --> 07:58.937
This will help you feel better.

08:29.843 --> 08:33.554
<i>"They bathe it at dusk.
They hide it with guile.</i>

08:33.554 --> 08:37.100
<i>At home in the forest,
forever lost in the wild."</i>

09:42.541 --> 09:44.251
"They bathe it at dusk."

10:36.011 --> 10:39.890
You know,
when a spouse loses their partner,

10:39.890 --> 10:42.476
you become a widow or a widower.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.729
An orphan, if you lose your parents.

10:47.856 --> 10:50.067
I don't think there's a single word
in the English language

10:50.067 --> 10:51.735
for a parent who loses a child.

10:54.905 --> 10:57.074
Why I wish we had
a dictionary in our library.

10:57.074 --> 10:59.743
How long have you kept me this way?

11:00.744 --> 11:02.913
You hadn't slept in a very long time.

11:02.913 --> 11:04.498
How long?

11:05.666 --> 11:06.583
A while.

11:08.168 --> 11:11.380
I'm losing time.

11:11.380 --> 11:13.549
No one knows where they are taken.

11:16.718 --> 11:18.512
All your little secrets.

11:19.054 --> 11:24.017
None of the women have ever,
ever found their children.

11:25.018 --> 11:30.232
And believe me, they've searched
until their bones grew frail and--

11:30.941 --> 11:32.734
and their hearts just couldn't
take it anymore.

11:33.694 --> 11:36.905
None found, including my own.

11:46.832 --> 11:49.168
Brian is different.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.044
Until he's not.

11:52.129 --> 11:56.258
If my husband is alive, he will find me.

11:56.258 --> 11:58.135
No one short of a god
could find this place.

12:00.095 --> 12:01.180
Well, then.

12:02.181 --> 12:04.016
I need to know where this came from.

12:06.143 --> 12:08.562
A library, you said?

12:09.313 --> 12:11.690
Well, it's modest, to say the least.

12:11.690 --> 12:12.858
Any books on trees?

12:13.859 --> 12:15.527
Are you gonna scream and make a scene?

12:18.614 --> 12:19.615
No.

12:25.954 --> 12:27.080
Come on, then. Let's go.

12:32.586 --> 12:33.879
Modest?

12:33.879 --> 12:35.297
Necessity's our priority.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.510
I can get you books.

12:40.969 --> 12:41.970
Thank you.

12:44.014 --> 12:48.560
But I prefer you just stay here
and we get to know one another.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.438
Just until we're sure of you.
You understand.

12:53.315 --> 12:56.443
Just, get to know some of the women.

12:57.152 --> 12:59.738
Take a walk. Get some fresh air. Explore--

13:00.280 --> 13:03.951
Emma, the first stage of grief is denial.
It's normal.

13:03.951 --> 13:07.287
Cal, you speak like
you're doing a TED Talk,

13:07.287 --> 13:11.625
and it's not only deeply patronizing,
but irritating as fuck.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.565
The fuck is the boat?

13:38.485 --> 13:39.486
Bitch.

14:22.779 --> 14:23.864
Now for the fun.

14:28.911 --> 14:31.330
In the woods there's a party.

14:33.332 --> 14:38.795
In the dark, past the horses,
the guests are dressed smartly.

14:40.047 --> 14:43.300
The music is playing.
The dancers move quick.

14:44.927 --> 14:48.347
<i>The child in their arms
will never grow sick,</i>

14:48.347 --> 14:51.892
<i>or old, or weak, or ever unloved.</i>

14:52.768 --> 14:55.646
<i>Not as long as the stars shine up above.</i>

14:56.480 --> 14:59.525
The fairies will hold it
close to their breast.

15:00.484 --> 15:03.487
They won't give it back.
They love it the best.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.185
A lot of boats...

15:36.186 --> 15:38.772
- Okay, I'll take it.
- What do you think?

15:41.733 --> 15:42.734
Elephant.

15:43.485 --> 15:44.486
Yeah.

15:47.656 --> 15:49.533
- Is this yours?
- One more spoon.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.035
I'm sorry.

15:55.664 --> 15:56.790
These your two kids?

16:00.544 --> 16:01.378
Yes.

16:02.713 --> 16:03.547
Yeah.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.301
Their middle sibling was

16:10.262 --> 16:11.597
Rachel.

16:19.521 --> 16:21.190
Where do they keep the boat?

16:23.066 --> 16:24.359
- I don't know.
- Liar.

16:29.948 --> 16:31.158
It's okay.

16:42.711 --> 16:47.174
It's in a garage
at the southeast end of the island.

16:49.510 --> 16:50.511
Good luck.

18:15.888 --> 18:20.475
Leave her be. You were her once too.

18:20.475 --> 18:21.768
She'll never make it.

18:22.686 --> 18:24.021
Well, at least she'll have tried.

19:31.213 --> 19:33.215
<i>I am the god, Apollo.</i>

19:37.761 --> 19:38.971
It's a boy.

19:41.431 --> 19:43.016
Should we name him Brian?

20:14.464 --> 20:15.757
"First comes love."

21:24.576 --> 21:28.205
<i>To The Waters and The Wild.</i> There you are.

21:43.595 --> 21:46.557
<i>Police and paramedics
found the child unresponsive,</i>

21:46.557 --> 21:48.600
<i>and he was pronounced dead at the scene.</i>

21:48.600 --> 21:52.145
<i>The missing woman, Emma Valentine,
is still unaccounted for</i>

21:52.145 --> 21:55.482
<i>and presumed dead,
her blood located at the scene.</i>

21:56.483 --> 21:59.820
<i>The father, Apollo Kagwa,
was rushed to intensive care</i>

21:59.820 --> 22:02.322
<i>after he was found with
extensive injuries.</i>

22:02.322 --> 22:04.199
No one short of a god.

22:04.199 --> 22:08.078
<i>Police are examining surveillance
camera footage from the surrounding area</i>

22:08.078 --> 22:09.788
<i>and how the disturbing pictures</i>

22:09.788 --> 22:12.583
<i>of the crime scene were leaked online.</i>

22:32.853 --> 22:33.937
Well, well, well.

22:36.148 --> 22:36.982
You came back.

22:38.108 --> 22:41.778
I've got nowhere else to go
until I know where to go.

22:44.198 --> 22:47.326
You're the only other people in the world
who've walked in my shoes.

22:51.079 --> 22:54.833
And I promised books.

22:58.504 --> 22:59.505
Yes.

23:00.088 --> 23:01.089
Thank you. Really.

23:01.590 --> 23:03.717
A life without books is no life.

23:03.717 --> 23:05.511
You'll get no argument from me.

23:08.305 --> 23:10.599
"'Well, who are you?'
asked the Caterpillar.

23:11.350 --> 23:14.186
This was not an encouraging opening
to a conversation.

23:14.895 --> 23:16.563
Alice replied, rather shyly,

23:17.231 --> 23:18.899
'I hardly know who I am, sir.

23:18.899 --> 23:22.402
I mean, at present, at least I know who
I was when I got up this morning,

23:22.402 --> 23:28.116
but I think since then
I must have changed several times.'

23:28.617 --> 23:32.371
'What do you mean by that?'
said the Caterpillar sternly.

23:32.371 --> 23:35.582
The Caterpillar and Alice looked
at each other in silence.

23:36.208 --> 23:39.419
And at last the Caterpillar
took the hookah out of his mouth."

23:39.419 --> 23:41.088
You know what a hookah is?

23:58.814 --> 23:59.815
Again?

24:00.816 --> 24:03.485
You can't read it that way.
Close your eyes.

24:03.986 --> 24:05.112
Boo!

24:07.906 --> 24:08.907
Thanks for the books.

24:13.161 --> 24:14.288
Can I ask you a question?

24:16.665 --> 24:18.876
Hey, you wanna go read it to your brother?

24:18.876 --> 24:20.711
- Yeah.
- Take your sister to the big bed.

24:21.420 --> 24:23.005
Okay. Let's go.

24:33.473 --> 24:34.474
Did you--

24:35.684 --> 24:37.728
Did you ever find anything

24:38.562 --> 24:42.232
when the baby was with you?

24:42.232 --> 24:45.652
Did you ever find anything in the crib?

24:47.362 --> 24:48.572
Find anything?

24:49.323 --> 24:56.205
It's a strange question. I know. But
did you find any kind of piece of, like,

24:57.497 --> 25:00.918
tree or plant or anything?

25:02.503 --> 25:03.795
Yeah. It was weird.

25:04.379 --> 25:08.800
I would find dirt--
like soil-- all the time

25:09.718 --> 25:10.719
and then...

25:13.555 --> 25:14.556
a leaf.

25:16.350 --> 25:19.770
One leaf... at the end.

25:21.939 --> 25:23.190
Do you have it?

25:23.190 --> 25:26.068
No, but it was a leaf.

25:26.568 --> 25:28.028
Yeah. Yeah.

25:28.862 --> 25:31.031
But I could draw it.

26:59.369 --> 27:00.537
Thank you, tree.

27:09.838 --> 27:13.800
<i>The Norway maple. An invasive species.</i>

27:14.301 --> 27:19.598
<i>The aggressive roots girdle even
the parent tree, choking itself to death.</i>

27:20.349 --> 27:23.143
<i>It creates a canopy of dense shade,</i>

27:23.143 --> 27:27.231
<i>preventing regeneration
of other seedlings and wildflowers.</i>

27:29.358 --> 27:31.610
<i>It is a sneaky bastard tree.</i>

27:43.872 --> 27:45.249
I'm coming for you.

27:51.338 --> 27:52.548
I need the Internet.

27:53.173 --> 27:54.716
There is no source of communication

27:54.716 --> 27:56.552
that could be traced
or tracked to this island.

27:57.135 --> 27:58.303
You messaged me online.

27:58.303 --> 28:01.890
We take a boat to South Brother Island
and use prepaid burner phones from there.

28:01.890 --> 28:05.602
- Then I'll have to take the boat again.
- That is not safe.

28:05.602 --> 28:08.230
I'm going whether you let me take it

28:08.230 --> 28:10.899
or I pry it
out of your freshly dead hands.

28:16.321 --> 28:17.573
I'll bring more books.

28:19.533 --> 28:20.576
All right.

28:20.576 --> 28:22.744
But let me show you
a better route through the city.

28:22.744 --> 28:25.455
And, Emma, if the police catch you,

28:25.455 --> 28:27.332
if you are arrested, you are alone.

28:27.332 --> 28:28.625
We cannot help you,

28:29.668 --> 28:31.795
and you never breathe a word
about this island.

30:01.301 --> 30:02.594
Emma Valentine.

30:07.641 --> 30:09.393
Welcome! Wheels.

30:10.644 --> 30:13.689
We're the "mole people" you convinced
yourself were just a fun story

30:13.689 --> 30:17.442
so you could spend a grand
on sushi at Shuko.

30:18.652 --> 30:21.864
I-- Yeah, I got nothing.

30:21.864 --> 30:24.074
Out of sight out of mind
suits us just fine.

30:25.993 --> 30:27.244
I'm looking for my son.

30:28.203 --> 30:30.581
Come, come. Morning is nimble.

30:32.499 --> 30:33.667
Hot down here.

30:33.667 --> 30:35.627
Steam pipes. Hundred degrees!

30:35.627 --> 30:38.589
Perfect for cooking a nice, rare steak.

30:39.882 --> 30:40.924
Climb aboard Old Ginny.

30:43.594 --> 30:44.595
Strap in!

31:03.113 --> 31:04.281
What's that?

31:04.281 --> 31:08.452
We got some ingenious bastards down here.
All walks of life.

31:08.452 --> 31:10.454
Managed to reroute the electrickery.

31:10.454 --> 31:13.665
Built bona fide real deal home.

31:16.084 --> 31:17.377
That's a pig.

31:17.377 --> 31:21.465
That's Henry.
Welcome to the Grand Central community.

31:21.965 --> 31:23.258
Yep, you're under it.

31:23.884 --> 31:25.219
How long have you been here?

31:25.219 --> 31:27.221
We've always been here, darling.

31:28.055 --> 31:29.806
As long as there's an above,
there's a below.

31:30.724 --> 31:32.935
Overground and underground.

31:32.935 --> 31:37.064
We got everybody:
Black, white, Asian, Latino,

31:37.064 --> 31:40.108
old, young, on drugs, off drugs,

31:40.108 --> 31:43.529
straight, gay, trans, LGBTQ+,
none of the above.

31:44.196 --> 31:46.448
I wanna say it's like a representation
of the city,

31:46.448 --> 31:51.161
but these tunnels aren't segregated
by race or class or gender,

31:51.161 --> 31:52.871
and that makes us better than them.

31:53.539 --> 31:55.624
You mightn't be able to get
any lower than this.

31:55.624 --> 31:59.002
But ain't no people higher
in both senses of the word.

32:02.673 --> 32:05.592
We got rules, and we live by them,
or you out.

32:06.260 --> 32:09.805
Also, you gotta be invited
to live down here by me.

32:10.389 --> 32:11.890
Gotta keep moving.

32:13.475 --> 32:16.353
Number of people
on the streets of New York City

32:16.353 --> 32:18.605
higher than since the Great Depression.

32:18.605 --> 32:21.400
Track 61. Know about it? Nope, you don't!

32:21.400 --> 32:22.651
'Cause it's a secret.

32:24.194 --> 32:28.240
I love history.
This track was built for FDR.

32:28.740 --> 32:31.451
It leads to a special platform
with an elevator

32:31.451 --> 32:35.372
that took him straight up
and into the Waldorf Astoria's garage

32:35.372 --> 32:37.416
'cause he had polio
and was in a wheelchair.

32:37.416 --> 32:39.126
And look at this.

32:39.126 --> 32:40.586
Beautiful, ain't she?

32:41.086 --> 32:43.881
Used to travel people
up and down Broadway.

32:44.381 --> 32:48.260
The cars came and gas money,
and they made her obsolete. What a crime.

32:49.219 --> 32:50.512
But now she's my house.

32:50.512 --> 32:52.139
No taxes, no bills,

32:52.139 --> 32:54.266
no time to invite you in for tea

32:54.266 --> 32:56.810
and regale you with the gamut
of my historical knowledge.

33:04.151 --> 33:05.986
This is the Columbus Circle community.

33:06.486 --> 33:09.364
- Hey! Got your water!
- Pick it up on the way back.

33:09.865 --> 33:13.327
- Water?
- Three man-made waterfalls in Central Park

33:13.327 --> 33:14.995
using the city's tap water.

33:14.995 --> 33:18.457
Good clean drinking water
for all us ne'er-do-wells.

33:19.041 --> 33:22.211
The Columbus community goes up there
at night and collects it for us,

33:22.211 --> 33:25.130
and then we pay them in whatever
we've managed to haul in.

33:25.756 --> 33:28.300
Porn mags, cigarettes, candy.

33:29.259 --> 33:30.719
I just love Skittles.

33:38.018 --> 33:40.229
Live tracks on the other side
of this baby.

33:40.729 --> 33:41.897
So, step lightly.

33:43.357 --> 33:44.733
Make yourself a pancake!

33:56.203 --> 33:57.579
Forgot about that one.

34:00.582 --> 34:02.251
Got the whole timetable up here,

34:02.918 --> 34:05.546
but they added a late train,
and I haven't filed it away yet.

34:06.547 --> 34:09.007
Be a real Greek tragedy
if I get you squished before you find--

34:09.007 --> 34:13.011
- What's his name?
- Brian. My son's name is Brian.

34:14.763 --> 34:16.348
You probably miss him very much.

34:17.766 --> 34:19.935
Sometimes I imagine
my mom might have searched everywhere

34:19.935 --> 34:21.603
to find out whatever happened to me.

34:22.771 --> 34:23.772
Sad.

34:24.606 --> 34:26.817
Okay, here's 181st. That's your stop.

34:28.318 --> 34:31.905
All right. All casual-like.

34:47.337 --> 34:49.590
I'll be waiting for you
back behind that door.

34:50.257 --> 34:51.717
Thank you for helping me.

34:52.509 --> 34:55.137
You're easy.
I've helped people do crazy shit,

34:56.346 --> 34:58.640
but I ain't pro bono.
I want something in return.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.184
I don't have any money or--

35:00.184 --> 35:03.937
<i>The Travels of Pedro de Cieza de León,
AD 1532-50,</i>

35:03.937 --> 35:06.481
<i>Contained in the First Part
of His Chronicle of Peru</i>.

35:08.108 --> 35:09.193
History buff.

35:10.194 --> 35:12.696
- Move fast. Morning is--
- Nimble.

35:12.696 --> 35:14.489
Hot on the heels of the moon.

35:36.053 --> 35:37.221
Okay.

35:51.985 --> 35:53.529
Where do you come from?

35:57.783 --> 36:00.285
It's too early. Shit.

36:11.004 --> 36:13.674
Yes. No.

36:14.383 --> 36:17.052
Seriously, it's fine, Mama, okay?
I'll be back later.

36:32.901 --> 36:34.611
We've been through this.

36:39.950 --> 36:42.494
Yeah. It's stock count today.

36:42.494 --> 36:44.204
They'll be here soon.

36:44.788 --> 36:46.915
Okay. Love you. Bye.

37:36.089 --> 37:37.883
- No! Don't shoot!
- Don't scream. Stop.

37:37.883 --> 37:39.343
Don't shoot! I don't know!

37:47.392 --> 37:48.477
Yurina.

37:53.065 --> 37:54.107
Fuck!

37:56.401 --> 37:59.404
Apollo, we're so sorry.

37:59.404 --> 38:03.700
Everyone's so sorry.
Everyone's so sorry! Where is she?

38:03.700 --> 38:05.410
- We don't know.
- We don't.

38:05.410 --> 38:08.455
Please, just let us go.

38:10.916 --> 38:12.626
People don't just disappear.

38:12.626 --> 38:15.462
They do. She did.

38:15.963 --> 38:17.422
- Apollo, we don't know anything.
- Apollo.

38:20.467 --> 38:23.387
- She kept saying that the baby--
- No, don't tell me she was fucking tired.

38:23.387 --> 38:24.471
She was--

38:24.471 --> 38:27.182
- I'm tired too.
- No, don't hurt yourself, Apollo!

38:32.479 --> 38:34.565
Hey, stop! Police!

38:35.983 --> 38:38.068
NYPD! Stop where you are!

38:41.864 --> 38:42.865
Police!

38:46.285 --> 38:48.537
Go, go, go, go, go!

38:56.336 --> 38:59.256
- Freeze!
- Hold it! Hold it!

39:00.465 --> 39:02.134
Stop where you are, ma'am!

39:03.135 --> 39:04.136
Hey!

39:08.599 --> 39:10.893
Wheels. Go, go, go!

39:13.520 --> 39:15.063
Stop! Police!

39:24.615 --> 39:26.325
Thanks for the book.

39:27.326 --> 39:28.660
Milk and sugar?

39:29.578 --> 39:30.787
You paused too long.

39:31.538 --> 39:33.040
Protein...

39:34.625 --> 39:35.876
and a dream.

39:38.337 --> 39:39.546
What now, Emma?

39:41.006 --> 39:42.174
I'll leave after dark.

39:42.674 --> 39:46.303
Deliver the books and then I'll come back.

39:46.929 --> 39:48.222
I'm--

39:52.643 --> 39:55.812
Gotta find
and check every Norway maple in the city.

39:56.522 --> 40:00.692
- That's all you got to go on?
- Yeah. That and a line from a kid's book.

40:02.986 --> 40:06.990
"They bathe it at dusk.
They hide it with guile.

40:07.908 --> 40:10.994
At home in the forest,
forever lost in the wild."

40:12.538 --> 40:14.081
Nah, not a fucking clue.

40:15.666 --> 40:17.125
Welp, Norway maple.

40:18.919 --> 40:20.087
I'm gonna say it came from Norway,

40:20.087 --> 40:24.132
- so start there.
- Great.

40:24.132 --> 40:28.345
Serious. Little Norway.
New York City, baby.

40:29.930 --> 40:32.432
- What?
- I told you I was a history buff.

40:33.225 --> 40:34.726
You weren't listening.

40:34.726 --> 40:40.524
That area there, Forest Hills in Queens,
used to be called Little Norway.

40:40.524 --> 40:45.404
First immigrants arrived in 1825.
Got a forest too.

40:47.197 --> 40:49.324
"At home in the forest.
Forever lost in the wild."

40:50.284 --> 40:51.952
Go bid your adieus.

40:52.452 --> 40:54.121
I'll meet you back here tomorrow night.

40:54.621 --> 40:55.622
Yeah.

40:58.542 --> 41:04.339
And if you think your mom never
wondered where you were, searched for you,

41:04.339 --> 41:07.676
then you're level 12 batshit.

41:08.719 --> 41:11.972
If your mom's still alive,
put her out of her misery, man.

41:41.418 --> 41:44.838
Wow. It's a real library now.

41:55.724 --> 41:56.725
If I find him--

41:56.725 --> 41:58.018
You'll get a message to us.

42:01.980 --> 42:05.400
Either way, you won't see me again.

42:07.694 --> 42:08.695
I know that.

42:32.594 --> 42:34.888
Have Wheels send someone back with it.

42:43.981 --> 42:47.651
Cal, if I don't make it and my son does,

42:48.694 --> 42:50.529
and somehow he comes looking for me.

42:52.614 --> 42:53.615
Somehow.

42:55.158 --> 42:56.785
This will give him comfort.

42:58.954 --> 43:00.914
My husband was obsessed with it.

43:02.249 --> 43:04.793
Apollo's dad used to read it to him
when he was little.

43:06.295 --> 43:09.006
Tell him-- Tell Brian...

43:11.383 --> 43:13.927
that Apollo was so looking forward
to doing the same.

43:15.470 --> 43:16.471
You got it.

43:18.348 --> 43:21.393
Have you thought about what happens
if you don't find him?

43:26.398 --> 43:27.524
Where will you look?

43:31.153 --> 43:32.529
Brian is in the forest.

43:42.664 --> 43:43.707
I don't forgive you.

43:45.209 --> 43:46.543
You drugged me.

43:46.543 --> 43:49.296
You lost me precious time
I could've used searching.

43:51.381 --> 43:55.052
I bought you rest
and a mind to think clearly.

43:56.094 --> 43:58.263
There are always two ways to see things.

44:17.950 --> 44:18.951
Good luck, Emma.

44:43.183 --> 44:44.476
Mama's coming for you.
