10:33.502 --> 10:36.157
that I'd get
the sayonara syringe.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.942
Man, I was 18.

10:38.986 --> 10:41.249
I didn't have no mommy
no more to help me.

10:41.292 --> 10:43.817
- Look, Carlos, I don't know
what went down then,

10:43.860 --> 10:45.775
but if you work with us now,

10:45.819 --> 10:47.298
you give up your accomplice,

10:47.342 --> 10:49.126
when you come up for parole,
I will go to the board.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.172
- Why do you keep
saying accomplice, man?

10:51.215 --> 10:52.913
I told you I wasn't even there.

10:52.956 --> 10:55.785
- Come on, man, everybody
in here says they're innocent.

10:55.829 --> 10:59.093
It's been 16 years.
That's almost half your life.

10:59.136 --> 11:00.877
Why are you
covering for this guy?

11:00.921 --> 11:02.749
- I swear to God,

11:02.792 --> 11:06.970
I came home and I saw them
lying there like that.

11:09.016 --> 11:10.974
It's all I've ever
thought about since.

11:11.018 --> 11:13.150
- Carisi,
this is a waste of time.

11:13.194 --> 11:14.804
- Hold on.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.414
Carlos, you said that--

11:16.458 --> 11:19.156
that you and Ricky were,
uh, you were hanging.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.202
Where?

11:24.771 --> 11:26.033
- That I can't say.

11:26.076 --> 11:27.469
- I told you this
was a waste of time.

11:27.512 --> 11:30.211
- Look, I'm not lying, okay?

11:31.516 --> 11:35.172
After he was released,
Ricky sent me this.

11:35.216 --> 11:37.174
He apologized for
putting me away.

11:37.218 --> 11:40.830
He said he was just saving
himself and back then...

11:40.874 --> 11:43.746
In Far Rock, we weren't angels.

11:43.790 --> 11:46.836
All right, but my mommy?
She was all I had.

11:46.880 --> 11:49.360
- Okay, you got
an alibi for that night?

11:49.404 --> 11:51.188
Or this goes nowhere.

11:55.410 --> 11:58.065
- Thank you for
your visit, gentlemen.

12:11.600 --> 12:11.774
.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.733
- Miss Baker?

12:14.951 --> 12:17.867
- Morning, detectives.
Help y'all?

12:17.911 --> 12:20.391
- Yes, ma'am.
You are Savannah Baker?

12:20.435 --> 12:24.787
- Well, the kids call me
"Moms," Moms Baker.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.833
Don't tell me another child

12:26.876 --> 12:28.399
has died
from them dopey-oids.

12:28.443 --> 12:29.792
- No, ma'am.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.272
We're here looking
for Ricardo Torrez.

12:31.315 --> 12:32.621
- The captain
of the housing unit

12:32.664 --> 12:33.709
thought you might
know where he is.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.406
- He paid his debt.

12:35.450 --> 12:36.973
- No, no, we just want
to ask a few questions.

12:37.017 --> 12:38.583
- And Carlos.

12:38.627 --> 12:40.672
No way he would
hurt a June bug,

12:40.716 --> 12:42.457
let alone his family.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.024
- You know about the murders.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.721
- I know he was a mama's boy.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.941
Never raised a hand
to hurt another child.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.681
- And what about Ricardo?

12:49.725 --> 12:53.337
- If Ricky threw himself
on the floor, he'd've missed.

12:53.381 --> 12:54.817
- But they both confessed.

12:54.861 --> 12:57.559
- Down home
we call that "railroading,"

12:57.602 --> 12:59.343
right, honey?

13:00.867 --> 13:02.694
[scoffs]

13:02.738 --> 13:04.827
Detective Monte...

13:04.871 --> 13:08.352
that prosecutor...

13:08.396 --> 13:11.747
They had the wrong boys,
but they didn't care.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.793
- Well, that's why we
want to talk to Ricardo.

13:13.836 --> 13:16.796
- Ricky lit right
back here from prison.

13:18.406 --> 13:21.975
He was so skinny.
I knew he had the bug.

13:22.018 --> 13:23.890
- HIV?

13:23.933 --> 13:28.329
- Full-blown AIDS.
He caught that while inside.

13:28.372 --> 13:30.070
He cried on my shoulder.

13:30.113 --> 13:33.377
He had lied on Carlos

13:33.421 --> 13:35.684
to save his own skin.

13:35.727 --> 13:38.295
- Moms, you know where
we can find Ricky?

13:38.339 --> 13:40.341
- He just passed.

13:40.384 --> 13:41.864
Last week.

13:41.908 --> 13:44.911
He asked me to, uh,

13:44.954 --> 13:47.435
scatter him out there

13:47.478 --> 13:51.874
where he and Carlos
skipped stones.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.658
- I'm so sorry.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.837
- Do you know who killed Ricky?

13:59.534 --> 14:02.537
That detective.

14:02.580 --> 14:05.801
You're sorry?
Talk to him.

14:12.112 --> 14:14.418
- You're retiring to Florida?

14:14.462 --> 14:16.072
Pension will go a lot further
down there, that's for sure.

14:16.116 --> 14:18.640
- Yeah, disability.
I'm out on three quarters.

14:18.683 --> 14:22.078
After collaring skells
like Hernandez and Torres,

14:22.122 --> 14:24.341
I don't wanna die
shoveling snow here

14:24.385 --> 14:25.908
in the stepchild borough.

14:25.952 --> 14:28.780
- I hear that.
- Carisi, huh?

14:28.824 --> 14:31.827
You related to Tony "No Toes"
Carisi up on Todt Hill?

14:31.871 --> 14:34.656
- My mother says
all Carisis are related.

14:34.699 --> 14:36.876
But about
Hernandez and Torres...

14:36.919 --> 14:38.616
you wrapped that
case up pretty quick.

14:38.660 --> 14:40.488
- First 48.
Listen, Counselor,

14:40.531 --> 14:42.925
you're not on the job.
Any cop who saw that scene,

14:42.969 --> 14:46.059
knew right away it had
to be banjos or bongos.

14:46.102 --> 14:49.062
The vics were PRs,
the mother was a crack putan,

14:49.105 --> 14:52.587
and the daughter was 13,
built like she was 23.

14:52.630 --> 14:54.850
Her son, Carlos, yeah,

14:54.894 --> 14:57.113
he was a big dopey stroonz,
horny as a bag of cats.

14:57.157 --> 14:58.854
- For his own sister, really?

14:58.898 --> 15:00.943
- An hour under the lamp
and the other one, Torres,

15:00.987 --> 15:02.902
flipped like an acrobat.

15:02.945 --> 15:05.165
A double homicide
cleared off the radio.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.862
Why do you two care?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.559
- We're working
a rape case, a young girl,

15:08.603 --> 15:09.821
and we got
a DNA hit that matches

15:09.865 --> 15:11.432
DNA from your crime scene.

15:11.475 --> 15:13.521
- It's gotta be Hernandez.
He was the doer.

15:13.564 --> 15:15.697
- No, neither.
Must've been a third man there.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.177
Do you remember
any other suspects?

15:17.220 --> 15:19.179
- Not a chance.
And let me tell you something.

15:19.222 --> 15:22.008
Those two--
it's not their first time.

15:22.051 --> 15:23.923
They were hitting
other projects.

15:23.966 --> 15:25.707
Three or four rapes,
teenage girls.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.449
Cases we couldn't make.
I just thank God

15:28.492 --> 15:31.104
that they were stupid enough
to hit their own home.

15:33.802 --> 15:35.499
- Carisi sent us cannolis

15:35.543 --> 15:37.023
from his favorite bakery
in Staten Island.

15:37.066 --> 15:38.981
- I'll make an exception.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.809
- So, aside from
the baked goods,

15:40.852 --> 15:42.071
did we get anything out there?

15:42.115 --> 15:43.638
- Pretty much
what we suspected.

15:43.681 --> 15:45.161
Detective Monte
wasn't interested in any

15:45.205 --> 15:46.684
other suspects
and Carisi thinks

15:46.728 --> 15:47.990
both confessions were coerced.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.600
- So we're not looking
for the third guy in,

15:49.644 --> 15:50.993
we're looking for the only guy.

15:51.037 --> 15:52.821
- The one that
got away with it.

15:52.864 --> 15:54.431
- You know, I thought
he was just trying to justify

15:54.475 --> 15:56.956
what he did,
but Monte--Monte did say

15:56.999 --> 15:58.522
that there'd been other rapes

15:58.566 --> 15:59.741
in the projects
around the same time.

15:59.784 --> 16:01.743
- So we could be
looking at a serial

16:01.786 --> 16:04.006
who's been out
there for 16 years.

16:05.268 --> 16:09.185
Okay, let's go back to unsolved
project rapes, check M.O.'s.

16:09.229 --> 16:10.752
Kat, you got the records

16:10.795 --> 16:12.884
of maintenance workers
at Lupe's projects, right?

16:12.928 --> 16:14.625
- Yep.

16:14.669 --> 16:16.627
- So cross check them and see
if anybody who worked there

16:16.671 --> 16:19.021
also worked at
Wave View 16 years ago.

16:22.546 --> 16:24.592
So we found 12
housing project rapes,

16:24.635 --> 16:26.768
but these two most
closely fit the pattern.

16:26.811 --> 16:29.945
- Maria Negron, 13.
Angela Lopez, 12.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.773
Both lived at
the Jersey Street projects.

16:31.816 --> 16:33.905
One happened in 2010,
the other in 2011.

16:33.949 --> 16:35.603
- No DNA on either?

16:35.646 --> 16:37.126
- No, they were both
assaulted from behind,

16:37.170 --> 16:38.736
strangled with a cord,

16:38.780 --> 16:40.477
and neither one of them
saw his face.

16:40.521 --> 16:41.826
- And that's his M.O.
Any suspects?

16:41.870 --> 16:44.090
- So there was 18
maintenance workers

16:44.133 --> 16:46.962
that worked at all
three of these projects

16:47.006 --> 16:48.659
that fit the timeline.

16:48.703 --> 16:51.227
Seven are black, two are
deceased, one is disabled.

16:51.271 --> 16:53.621
- So we're gonna need DNA
warrants on these eight guys.

16:53.664 --> 16:55.666
- Eight? Why not make it nine?
Make it a ball team.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.146
Come on, no judge
is gonna sign off on this.

16:57.190 --> 16:58.974
You gotta
narrow it down for me.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.194
- All right, so we can ask them
to volunteer for exclusion.

17:01.237 --> 17:02.804
If they're innocent,

17:02.847 --> 17:04.284
then they shouldn't
have a problem with that.

17:04.327 --> 17:05.981
- Okay, anybody balks,
I'll get you a warrant.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.765
- You're leaving us again?
- Got a pretrial motion.

17:07.809 --> 17:09.811
Feel free to stay
as long as you want.

17:09.854 --> 17:13.162
- All right,
so coordinate with Fin and Kat

17:13.206 --> 17:14.816
and make sure that
you talk to all eight guys.

17:14.859 --> 17:16.078
- Copy that.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.253
- I'll meet you
back in the squadroom.

17:17.297 --> 17:18.820
I have a lunch...

17:18.863 --> 17:20.213
with my brother, Simon.

17:20.256 --> 17:22.737
- Wow, it's been a while.
What does he want?

17:22.780 --> 17:25.870
- He says that he wants
to get to know Noah.

17:25.914 --> 17:27.916
- You believe him?

17:27.959 --> 17:30.049
- I do.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.799
- Tim Stanton.
[power drill buzzes]

17:41.843 --> 17:44.106
- Yeah?
- NYPD.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.890
Can we talk to you
for a minute?

17:45.934 --> 17:47.849
- Uh, they keep me pretty busy.

17:47.892 --> 17:49.285
- Yeah, well, we're here
investigating the assault

17:49.329 --> 17:50.939
from the other night.
You heard about that?

17:50.982 --> 17:52.201
- Yeah, horrible.

17:52.245 --> 17:53.681
- You're the maintenance guy.

17:53.724 --> 17:55.552
You been working
here for a long time?

17:55.596 --> 17:57.032
- They send me
where they need me.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.165
- Okay, well, you noticed
anybody that doesn't belong?

17:59.208 --> 18:00.905
Trying doors,
checking out the stairwell?

18:00.949 --> 18:03.256
- All the time.
Bangers, homeless, dealers.

18:03.299 --> 18:06.128
Got guys on the registry
in this neighborhood.

18:06.172 --> 18:08.043
- We're all over that.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.698
Just hoping maybe you could
come check out some mug shots.

18:10.741 --> 18:11.960
- Shouldn't the girl do that?

18:12.003 --> 18:13.353
- She didn't get
a good look at him.

18:13.396 --> 18:15.006
- Ah, that's too bad.

18:15.050 --> 18:16.834
Listen,
I'd do anything to help, but,

18:16.878 --> 18:18.184
I don't have a head for faces.

18:18.227 --> 18:20.055
- There's something
else you could do.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.971
We need your DNA to exclude
you from the investigation.

18:23.014 --> 18:26.148
- My DNA put in the system?
That ain't happening.

18:26.192 --> 18:29.020
Who knows what the government
does with that?

18:29.064 --> 18:31.197
- We're just asking you
for a little help.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.155
- Look, I feel
sorry for the girl,

18:33.199 --> 18:36.158
but I got places to be.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.073
You need anything else from me,

18:38.117 --> 18:40.597
let me know.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.211
- First guy to say no.

18:45.254 --> 18:47.256
I'm calling Carisi
for a warrant.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.824
- Yeah, save him the trouble.

18:49.867 --> 18:51.608
- In that case, I'll call Liv.

18:53.219 --> 18:56.004
- Great, and the lab knows
that it's a rush?

18:56.047 --> 18:57.745
Okay.

18:57.788 --> 19:00.313
Thanks, Rollins.
Nice work.

19:01.749 --> 19:03.229
- [groans]
When's your friend

19:03.272 --> 19:04.795
going to get here?

19:04.839 --> 19:06.145
- I don't know, honey.

19:06.188 --> 19:08.190
- I don't wanna be late
for dance class.

19:08.234 --> 19:09.974
- Okay, sweetie, I'm sorry.
I know.

19:10.018 --> 19:12.020
I'll find out.
I'll find out.

19:12.063 --> 19:13.978
Hi, excuse me.

19:14.022 --> 19:16.111
- Oh, did you want
to go ahead and order?

19:16.155 --> 19:18.200
- Actually, we're still
waiting for our third.

19:18.244 --> 19:20.637
Um, you're sure that
you didn't see a man,

19:20.681 --> 19:22.291
he had dark hair, light eyes...

19:22.335 --> 19:24.119
The reservation
was under Benson?

19:24.163 --> 19:26.165
- I'll check again.
- Thank you.

19:31.909 --> 19:34.303
You know what, Noah,
give me a second.

19:38.438 --> 19:41.876
Simon, it's me and Noah,

19:41.919 --> 19:44.226
and we are here
waiting for you.

19:44.270 --> 19:48.883
Listen, uh, I knew that
this was a bad idea,

19:48.926 --> 19:51.755
so...uh, don't--

19:51.799 --> 19:53.888
don't bother
calling me back, okay?

19:53.931 --> 19:58.022
As a matter of fact, Simon,
don't--don't ever call me.

20:06.901 --> 20:07.293
.

20:07.336 --> 20:09.338
- Captain.
- Good morning.

20:09.382 --> 20:11.514
- We got a match
on Tim Stanton.

20:11.558 --> 20:14.387
The lab confirms that
his DNA matches the touch DNA

20:14.430 --> 20:16.258
on Lupe's headphones
and the DNA found

20:16.302 --> 20:17.781
under the nails
of Jacinta and Nydia.

20:17.825 --> 20:19.653
- I was ready to arrest
that guy right there.

20:19.696 --> 20:23.178
- Hold on, let's wait.
Touch DNA on headphones...

20:23.222 --> 20:26.312
I'd like to see Lupe
make a positive ID...

20:26.355 --> 20:27.922
Where did you
leave it with Stanton?

20:27.965 --> 20:29.532
- He pretended like
he wanted to help.

20:29.576 --> 20:31.839
- So tell him that
we've collared a sex offender

20:31.882 --> 20:33.449
that we know is good for this

20:33.493 --> 20:34.929
and we just need help
with the lineup.

20:34.972 --> 20:36.626
- You think he'll go for that?

20:36.670 --> 20:38.411
- I think that he
let Hernandez and Torres

20:38.454 --> 20:40.195
take the fall before.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.936
He's just gonna think
that we've screwed up again.

20:41.979 --> 20:43.720
See if Lupe
is up for a lineup.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.766
- Cool.

20:49.552 --> 20:51.554
- So Lupe said
she didn't see him,

20:51.598 --> 20:53.382
but she did hear his voice.

20:53.426 --> 20:56.298
So if she can't do a lineup,
see if she can do a voice ID.

20:56.342 --> 20:58.779
- Yeah, copy that.
Um...listen,

20:58.822 --> 21:01.608
I was out of line--
what I said about your brother.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.307
- No, you weren't.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.309
Noah doesn't need any more
confusion about his life.

21:07.353 --> 21:11.357
That door's...
that door stays closed.

21:17.667 --> 21:19.713
- Take your time.

21:26.546 --> 21:28.896
- I didn't really see his face.

21:28.939 --> 21:30.985
- But you heard
his voice, right?

21:31.028 --> 21:33.335
- Yes.

21:33.379 --> 21:34.684
- Would you be okay hearing

21:34.728 --> 21:36.556
something that
he said to you again?

21:36.599 --> 21:39.428
- Mm-hmm.

21:40.951 --> 21:43.780
- Okay, number one.

21:43.824 --> 21:46.957
- Okay, chiquita,
do it nice for Papi.

21:48.350 --> 21:49.569
- Number two.

21:49.612 --> 21:51.484
- I'm not comfortable
saying this.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.660
- It's him.
- Just read the words.

21:53.703 --> 21:54.878
- Do I have to say this?

21:54.922 --> 21:56.402
- It's him.

21:56.445 --> 21:58.055
- Okay, chiquita,
do it nice for Papi.

21:58.099 --> 21:59.709
- It's him,
it's him, it's him.

21:59.753 --> 22:02.016
[sobbing]
It's him.

22:02.059 --> 22:04.366
It's him.
- It's okay.

22:04.410 --> 22:06.455
- [sobbing]
- It's okay.

22:06.499 --> 22:08.544
- Yeah, well, see,
I did some work

22:08.588 --> 22:10.546
on Lupe's mom's
bathroom recently,

22:10.590 --> 22:12.418
so I moved the kid's
headphones out of the way.

22:12.461 --> 22:14.376
I didn't--didn't want
to get no water on 'em.

22:14.420 --> 22:15.943
- That makes sense.

22:15.986 --> 22:18.728
- So I'm good to go?
- More like good to go away.

22:18.772 --> 22:20.382
We got another hit on your DNA,

22:20.426 --> 22:22.993
from a 16-year-old attack
in Far Rock.

22:23.037 --> 22:24.821
- The double murder?

22:24.865 --> 22:27.084
No, the son
and his buddy confessed.

22:27.128 --> 22:28.782
It can't be me.

22:28.825 --> 22:31.393
That's, uh, like,
double jeopardy or something.

22:31.437 --> 22:32.612
- Not really.

22:32.655 --> 22:36.093
- Besides,
even if my DNA was there...

22:36.137 --> 22:38.008
I probably worked
on that apartment, too.

22:38.052 --> 22:40.402
- Work?
That's how your blood and skin

22:40.446 --> 22:42.622
got under
the victim's fingernails?

22:44.450 --> 22:46.321
- All due respect,

22:46.365 --> 22:49.063
I think it's time for me
to shut down and lawyer up.

22:50.456 --> 22:51.979
- Well, he's right.

22:52.022 --> 22:53.981
It's gonna be pretty
hard to pin a double murder

22:54.024 --> 22:56.592
on him when there's somebody
still sitting in prison for it.

22:56.636 --> 22:59.116
- Lupe made a voice ID?
- She did.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.596
- All right, arrest Stanton,
keep him in holding.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.424
I'm gonna go up
and see Carlos Hernandez.

23:02.468 --> 23:04.731
See if he can ID this scumbag.

23:09.779 --> 23:12.478
- You just swipe.

23:14.567 --> 23:16.090
- What I remember
is those maintenance guys

23:16.133 --> 23:18.353
hardly ever came around.

23:20.486 --> 23:23.445
Him, we waited
over a year for him

23:23.489 --> 23:24.925
to fix Mommy's kitchen cabinet.

23:24.968 --> 23:26.143
- He was in your apartment,
you're sure?

23:26.187 --> 23:27.841
- Positive.

23:27.884 --> 23:29.495
There was a family of mice
living under the sink

23:29.538 --> 23:32.628
and I was scared to open it.

23:32.672 --> 23:34.500
Now I live with rats.

23:34.543 --> 23:37.154
This guy came,

23:37.198 --> 23:39.592
plugs mice holes,
fixes the cabinet.

23:42.029 --> 23:44.466
He even asked
Jacinta to teach him

23:44.510 --> 23:46.599
her Shakira dance moves.

23:48.078 --> 23:50.385
You think he killed them?

23:50.429 --> 23:52.474
- Well, there's no sign
of forced entry.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.476
Do you think your sister
would have let him in?

23:54.520 --> 23:56.478
- Any time any of those guys
came around, you let them in.

23:56.522 --> 23:59.089
You might not see
someone again for six months.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.484
Why would he kill them?

24:02.528 --> 24:05.922
- He's raping your sister,
your mother comes home...

24:07.837 --> 24:09.970
- He'd've had to kill her.

24:10.013 --> 24:11.624
He confess?

24:11.667 --> 24:14.017
- No.

24:14.061 --> 24:17.804
- But with his DNA, right,
and if Ricky testifies...

24:20.459 --> 24:22.461
- Ricky won't be testifying.

24:25.768 --> 24:27.161
- When did he pass?

24:27.204 --> 24:28.815
- A few days ago.

24:28.858 --> 24:32.862
- He felt bad about what
he did to me and to himself.

24:34.516 --> 24:36.083
He's at peace now.

24:36.126 --> 24:37.606
- And we still
have his letter.

24:37.650 --> 24:39.521
Plus the new DNA.

24:39.565 --> 24:40.914
I'm confident
when the Queens DA...

24:40.957 --> 24:44.047
- Queens DA?
Is it still Keane?

24:44.091 --> 24:46.615
- 16 years,
like the mummy's hand.

24:46.659 --> 24:49.052
- Man, that guy--
he got himself elected

24:49.096 --> 24:51.533
Queens DA
off of putting me away.

24:51.577 --> 24:53.056
- Listen, Carlos,

24:53.100 --> 24:55.058
I'm not gonna
promise you anything.

24:55.102 --> 24:57.713
But I do know somebody
that works in that office.

24:57.757 --> 24:59.628
A high ranking ADA.

24:59.672 --> 25:01.848
I trust him.
He's a good guy.

25:01.891 --> 25:04.938
- Yeah?
Why's he working for Keane?

25:09.943 --> 25:12.598
- So you did it?
- Hi.

25:12.641 --> 25:14.556
- From detective to ADA.
How's it going?

25:14.600 --> 25:17.124
- Oh, I miss my gun
and the pay cut's no fun,

25:17.167 --> 25:19.082
but I still remember

25:19.126 --> 25:20.562
what you said
my first year at Fordham Law.

25:20.606 --> 25:22.085
- Yeah, what was that?

25:22.129 --> 25:23.783
- Better 100 guilty men go free

25:23.826 --> 25:25.567
than one innocent man
be condemned.

25:25.611 --> 25:27.177
- You know
I was quoting Voltaire.

25:27.221 --> 25:29.571
- Of course, but it was
the way--the way you said it.

25:29.615 --> 25:31.094
It was like you believed in it.

25:31.138 --> 25:32.748
That's why I
brought this to you.

25:32.792 --> 25:34.576
Did you get a chance
to go over the case file?

25:34.620 --> 25:36.926
- Carlos Hernandez
had a terrible lawyer.

25:36.970 --> 25:38.928
He and Ricky, they were kids.

25:38.972 --> 25:42.018
They had their whole lives
taken from them.

25:42.062 --> 25:43.672
- So you can help
Carlos get out?

25:43.716 --> 25:45.761
- Look, it's tough to get
any DA to overturn a case,

25:45.805 --> 25:48.111
let alone over here in Queens.
But a rape and double murder

25:48.155 --> 25:49.939
my boss built his career on?

25:49.983 --> 25:51.854
- There's no DNA.

25:51.898 --> 25:53.595
Manhattan SVU has matched
it to a guy who's good

25:53.639 --> 25:55.205
for a series
of housing projects rapes.

25:55.249 --> 25:56.946
- Did he confess to this?

25:56.990 --> 25:58.513
Why would he?

25:58.557 --> 26:00.123
He knows it's a closed case,
two confessions.

26:00.167 --> 26:02.604
- They both recanted.
Ricky in a dying declaration.

26:02.648 --> 26:03.997
- Yeah, I read that, too.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.999
- I know this was Keane's case,

26:06.042 --> 26:07.609
but once he hears
the preponderance

26:07.653 --> 26:09.219
of exculpatory evidence...

26:09.263 --> 26:12.919
- You haven't heard...
about Keane.

26:18.838 --> 26:21.667
- DA Keane is
ready for you now.

26:23.364 --> 26:26.715
- Mr. Keane,
this is Manhattan ADA Carisi.

26:26.759 --> 26:29.326
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- You, too, Mr. Keane.

26:29.370 --> 26:31.981
Sir, I don't know if you've had
a chance to look over the...

26:32.025 --> 26:33.635
- What case are you here about?

26:33.679 --> 26:35.245
- The double homicide

26:35.289 --> 26:37.813
of Nydia and Jacinta Hernandez
in Far Rockaway.

26:37.857 --> 26:39.685
- You know why it's
called Far Rockaway?

26:41.338 --> 26:43.602
- No, sir, actually, I don't.

26:43.645 --> 26:45.168
- Because it's way far out.

26:45.212 --> 26:48.563
- It was also the scene
of a brutal double murder.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.217
It was your case, Mr. Keane.

26:50.260 --> 26:51.958
- The victim's son confessed,

26:52.001 --> 26:53.786
but his lawyer knew that
there was DNA at the scene.

26:53.829 --> 26:55.265
He didn't ask
for it to be tested.

26:55.309 --> 26:57.659
- Lawyers...
do you know that Shea Stadium

26:57.703 --> 26:59.269
was named because of a lawyer?

26:59.313 --> 27:02.969
Yes, William Shea.
It's still Shea Stadium.

27:03.012 --> 27:04.797
- I did know that one, sir.

27:04.840 --> 27:07.669
Um, now I know you're
very busy, Mr. Keane, but...

27:07.713 --> 27:09.845
the reason I'm here
is about getting justice

27:09.889 --> 27:11.194
for Carlos Hernandez.

27:11.238 --> 27:14.371
- Hernandez,
what a good first baseman.

27:14.415 --> 27:17.026
You know the Mets
couldn't have won anything

27:17.070 --> 27:18.941
in '86 without him.

27:20.334 --> 27:22.641
- I believe
that was Keith, sir.

27:22.684 --> 27:24.294
- Hmm.

27:24.338 --> 27:26.688
- I have some paperwork here
I'd like you to consider

27:26.732 --> 27:28.211
signing, agreeing to vacate

27:28.255 --> 27:29.778
the conviction
of Carlos Hernandez...

27:29.822 --> 27:31.867
- Put it over there
on the table.

27:31.911 --> 27:34.217
I'm very, very busy.
I'll do my best.

27:34.261 --> 27:39.048
I want to impress upon you
both not to leave law school.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.748
It can be a rewarding career.

27:45.098 --> 27:47.100
- Okay, sir.

27:55.325 --> 27:55.543
.

27:55.586 --> 27:57.545
- DA Keane won't let this go?

27:57.588 --> 27:59.068
- No, it was worse.
He had no idea

27:59.112 --> 28:00.113
what I was asking him to do.

28:00.156 --> 28:01.157
- What does that mean?

28:01.201 --> 28:02.332
- For years, Keane's deputies

28:02.376 --> 28:03.507
have covered up the fact

28:03.551 --> 28:05.727
that he's suffering
from dementia.

28:05.771 --> 28:09.122
- Well, how bad is it?
I mean, good days, bad days?

28:09.165 --> 28:10.689
- Well, he thought
Carlos Hernandez played

28:10.732 --> 28:12.255
first base
for the '86 Mets, so...

28:12.299 --> 28:13.779
- Okay, well, what
about his deputies?

28:13.822 --> 28:16.520
Can't they step up?
'Cause we have three more

28:16.564 --> 28:18.218
rape kit hits
from Stanton's DNA.

28:18.261 --> 28:19.567
Plus an eye-witness.

28:19.610 --> 28:21.351
- Keane can't
even undo his tie,

28:21.395 --> 28:23.789
never mind a 16-year-old
double homicide.

28:23.832 --> 28:26.313
One of my former law
professors, he works

28:26.356 --> 28:27.662
in the Queens DA's office,

28:27.706 --> 28:29.403
he said he could try
to get Carlos a retrial.

28:29.446 --> 28:31.231
- Sorry to interrupt, Captain.

28:31.274 --> 28:33.450
Stanton's lawyer's here.
He needs a word.

28:35.452 --> 28:36.889
- [sighs]

28:36.932 --> 28:38.412
- My client will agree
to forcible touching

28:38.455 --> 28:39.587
on the girl from
Jacob Lawrence Houses.

28:39.630 --> 28:41.676
- He raped her.
- Says who?

28:41.720 --> 28:43.547
- She didn't see her attacker
and DNA on headphones?

28:43.591 --> 28:45.288
Probative of nothing.

28:45.332 --> 28:46.725
- We have a voice ID.

28:46.768 --> 28:48.596
- No eye witnesses,
only an ear witness.

28:48.639 --> 28:51.425
I'll convince the jury that
little Lupe is deaf and blind.

28:51.468 --> 28:54.558
- Little Lupe
is tougher than you think.

28:54.602 --> 28:56.822
- Juries love me
and they don't like cops.

28:56.865 --> 29:00.564
And that goes double for cops
who turned into prosecutors.

29:00.608 --> 29:02.392
They're gonna hate you.
- Well, maybe not...

29:02.436 --> 29:04.264
After they find out
your client's DNA

29:04.307 --> 29:05.569
was at three
different rape scenes.

29:05.613 --> 29:08.616
- And we have three
projects-strong girls,

29:08.659 --> 29:10.705
just like Lupe, who will
follow her to the stand.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.403
- We're going after
your client for all six rapes,

29:13.447 --> 29:15.754
including the Far Rockaway
rape and the double murder.

29:15.797 --> 29:17.451
- You're chasing
a 16-year-old murder case

29:17.494 --> 29:19.496
with two confessions?
And a district attorney

29:19.540 --> 29:21.368
who's playing poker
with tarot cards.

29:21.411 --> 29:22.891
- You wanna cut a deal?
Your client allocutes

29:22.935 --> 29:25.285
to the Hernandez murders
and maybe I can swing

29:25.328 --> 29:27.722
criminally negligent homicide
