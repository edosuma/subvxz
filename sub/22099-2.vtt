15:54.370 --> 15:55.412
What?

15:55.496 --> 15:57.664
Admiral's decided to put
some boots on the ground,

15:57.749 --> 15:59.541
wants to send
an officer as a liaison

15:59.626 --> 16:03.462
between us and the resistance elements
on the planet to coordinate the rescue op.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.213
It makes sense.
What's the problem?

16:05.298 --> 16:07.341
It's who he's sending.

16:10.011 --> 16:11.762
He's frakking kidding
with this, right?

16:11.846 --> 16:13.639
I wish he were.

16:14.682 --> 16:18.143
Mr. Hoshi, I want a Raptor prepped and
ready in five minutes on the hangar deck.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.478
Inform the flagship
I'm coming aboard.

16:19.562 --> 16:20.854
I want a private meeting
with the Admiral.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.022
HOSHI: Aye, sir.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.732
What are you gonna do?

16:23.816 --> 16:26.234
What I should have done
a long time ago.

16:29.072 --> 16:31.740
You can't do this.
She's a Cylon.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.075
Well, I trust her.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.826
Well, that's a mistake.

16:34.911 --> 16:37.162
Well, it'll be
my mistake, won't it?

16:37.246 --> 16:40.415
You are gambling with the
lives of everyone on this ship.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.042
Everyone on my ship.

16:42.126 --> 16:46.672
I don't need a lecture from you
about the responsibilities of command.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.590
We're done here.

16:51.969 --> 16:55.972
I'm not finished. This entire
plan is a reckless gamble.

16:56.057 --> 16:59.059
And yes, you certainly have the right
to risk the lives of the men and women

16:59.143 --> 17:01.103
under your command,
but that's not the issue.

17:01.187 --> 17:04.189
The issue is you are risking the
lives of the entire human race.

17:04.273 --> 17:05.899
I'm trying to save
the human race.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.109
No. No, you're not.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.861
That's what you're not seeing.
Right now, the human race,

17:09.946 --> 17:12.364
well, that's the 2,000 people
huddled in those civilian ships

17:12.448 --> 17:14.533
that managed to get away
when the Cylons came back.

17:14.617 --> 17:15.909
They're the safe bet.

17:15.993 --> 17:17.911
They're the ones who
survived and we should guard,

17:17.995 --> 17:20.038
just like we did after
the attack on the colonies.

17:20.123 --> 17:22.833
Sharon can penetrate
the Cylon defenses.

17:22.917 --> 17:23.875
It's not about her.

17:23.960 --> 17:27.879
The Centurions can't distinguish
her from the other humanoid models.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.089
Did you know that?
Admiral...

17:29.173 --> 17:31.049
They were deliberately
programmed that way.

17:31.134 --> 17:35.929
The Cylons didn't want them becoming
self-aware and suddenly resisting orders.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.766
They didn't want their own
robotic rebellion on their hands.

17:39.851 --> 17:41.476
You can appreciate
the irony.

17:41.561 --> 17:42.561
Dad...

17:42.645 --> 17:44.020
I know what
you're saying,

17:44.105 --> 17:48.150
but we have a responsibility to
the people that we left behind.

17:50.153 --> 17:51.778
Remember
what Roslin said.

17:51.863 --> 17:56.575
"Our first responsibility is
to the survival of humanity. "

17:56.659 --> 17:58.869
We can't
lose sight of that.

18:00.872 --> 18:02.998
Over the last year,

18:03.750 --> 18:07.085
we've lost sight
of almost everything.

18:07.962 --> 18:11.047
We got soft.

18:14.177 --> 18:18.764
But if we go back to New
Caprica now, and we lose,

18:20.558 --> 18:22.017
it's over.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.644
Humanity just stops

18:25.229 --> 18:29.524
and an admiral's stars don't give
you the right to make that gamble.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.532
You're right, Son.

18:40.411 --> 18:43.163
You should make plans for
resuming the search for Earth

18:43.247 --> 18:45.290
with Pegasus and
the civilian fleet.

18:45.374 --> 18:46.666
With Pegasus?
What about Galactica?

18:46.751 --> 18:50.462
I know why we left
those people behind.

18:50.546 --> 18:54.633
And I know that it was their choice
in the first place to be down there,

18:54.717 --> 19:00.806
and I realize that the survival of
the human race outweighs anything else.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.058
But this time,

19:05.603 --> 19:09.397
I can't live with it,
can't face it.

19:12.235 --> 19:16.071
Maybe I'm a coward,
but I'm going back...

19:16.155 --> 19:17.614
Dad, you won't
have a chance.

19:17.698 --> 19:19.324
I'm going back, Son.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.502
LEOBEN: Once I fertilized your egg,

19:30.586 --> 19:34.589
we transferred it to a human
woman who carried it to term.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.717
She's pretty, funny,

19:39.345 --> 19:40.804
great smile.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.347
You would have liked her.

19:42.431 --> 19:46.810
Although her mother died during
childbirth, Kacey's heart never failed.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.980
I guess she gets that
will to live from you.

19:51.315 --> 19:52.983
I've seen her path.

19:55.278 --> 19:59.030
It's difficult
but rewarding.

19:59.115 --> 20:00.782
She'll know the mind
of God in this lifetime.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.201
She'll see patterns
that others do not see.

20:03.286 --> 20:06.621
She probably gets that
spiritual clarity from me.

20:12.545 --> 20:16.298
She'll be hungry soon.
There's food on the table.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.470
You wouldn't let your own
child starve, would you?

20:22.555 --> 20:25.682
It's not my child. I don't
even know if it's human.

20:25.766 --> 20:30.270
Half human. I mean, you know that
she's yours. You just won't admit it.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.440
Where the frak are you going?

20:34.609 --> 20:35.817
Take this with you!

20:37.528 --> 20:40.572
Hey! Don't leave me
alone with this!

20:41.365 --> 20:42.741
Frak.

20:45.786 --> 20:50.373
I don't know who or what you are, but
I do know this. I'm not your mother.

20:52.585 --> 20:57.422
I don't care that it's effective. I
don't care that the Cylons can't stop it.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.007
It's wrong.

21:00.051 --> 21:03.762
No more suicide bombings,
Colonel. You understand?

21:03.846 --> 21:06.806
What, are you working
for the Cylons now?

21:13.064 --> 21:15.190
I'm sorry. There was no excuse for that.

21:17.818 --> 21:22.113
You see, little things like
that, they don't matter anymore.

21:22.198 --> 21:25.492
In fact, not too frakking
much really matters anymore.

21:25.576 --> 21:28.453
I've got one job here, lady,
and one job only,

21:28.537 --> 21:30.413
to destruct the Cylons,

21:30.498 --> 21:33.541
make them worry about the anthill
they've stirred up down here,

21:33.626 --> 21:38.588
so they're distracted and out of position
when the old man shows up in orbit.

21:38.673 --> 21:41.383
The bombings? They got
the Cylons' attention.

21:41.467 --> 21:45.595
They really got their attention.
And I am not giving that up.

21:45.680 --> 21:49.557
ROSLIN: We are talking about
people blowing themselves up.

21:50.434 --> 21:55.689
You know, sometimes I think that
you've got ice water in those veins

21:55.773 --> 22:00.276
and other times I think you're
just a naive, little schoolteacher.

22:00.361 --> 22:03.613
I've sent men on suicide
missions in two wars now,

22:03.698 --> 22:05.657
and let me
tell you something,

22:05.741 --> 22:07.534
it don't make a gods-damn
bit of difference

22:07.618 --> 22:11.037
whether they're riding in a Viper
or walking out onto a parade ground.

22:11.122 --> 22:13.540
In the end,
they're just as dead.

22:17.586 --> 22:22.674
So take your piety and your moralizing
and your high-minded principles

22:22.758 --> 22:26.302
and stick them someplace safe
until you're off this rock

22:26.387 --> 22:30.765
and you're sitting in your nice,
cushy chair on Colonial One again.

22:32.393 --> 22:34.436
I've got a war to fight.

22:35.104 --> 22:37.188
MAN 1: Let's go.
Move it.

22:37.273 --> 22:39.107
This way.
Offload the rest.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.650
MAN 2: Let's go
to isolation. Move!

22:40.735 --> 22:43.570
BOOMER: The detentions are just causing
more resentment and more enemies.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.697
We're losing ground with the
people. MAN 3: Let's move! Get going!

22:45.781 --> 22:47.699
I know. We don't
have another option.

22:47.783 --> 22:50.910
We have to send the message that
suicide bombings won't be tolerated.

22:50.995 --> 22:55.165
Excuse me, sir. Can I
talk to you for a moment?

22:55.249 --> 22:57.208
Yeah, sure, Jammer.
We'll catch up later.

22:57.293 --> 22:58.585
Okay.

23:00.296 --> 23:03.131
Sir, I don't know exactly
how to broach this,

23:03.215 --> 23:09.012
nor do I know exactly what I expect
you to do about it, but since we were...

23:10.306 --> 23:12.390
Anyway, since we were
back on Galactica...

23:12.475 --> 23:14.267
Yeah, Jammer,
just spit it out.

23:14.351 --> 23:17.896
We picked up Chief Tyrol's
wife on the last raid. Cally.

23:17.980 --> 23:20.648
She's in detention.
I think she's on the list.

23:23.110 --> 23:24.569
(CHILD MURMURING)

24:44.191 --> 24:45.525
Kacey?

(BEEPING)

25:03.127 --> 25:04.544
LEOBEN: Kara?

25:38.454 --> 25:40.622
Hi, Cally.
It's me. Boomer.

25:48.297 --> 25:50.173
I wish I had a gun.

25:55.137 --> 25:59.349
Are you all right?
Physically, I mean.

25:59.433 --> 26:01.643
What do you want from me?

26:09.193 --> 26:13.863
Look, a lot's happened
in everyone's life.

26:14.281 --> 26:17.575
But I want you to know...
I want you and Galen to know

26:17.660 --> 26:19.035
that I'm happy for you,

26:20.412 --> 26:22.747
especially since you
started a family.

26:24.500 --> 26:27.543
Something that him and I
talked about once before.

26:31.548 --> 26:33.758
Can you get me
out of here?

26:35.261 --> 26:38.513
I don't know. I have nothing
to do with internal security...

26:38.597 --> 26:43.184
Then frak you, Sharon, you
stupid, frakked-up toaster.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.520
How many times do I have
to shoot you, anyway?

26:45.604 --> 26:50.566
If you can't help me, then
just go away and leave us alone!

27:04.290 --> 27:07.083

27:12.131 --> 27:15.633
Keep coming, keep coming... MAN 2:
Everyone have both your IDs ready.

27:15.718 --> 27:17.844
Step on up.
Worker IDs out.

27:18.929 --> 27:23.558
Straight ahead, move it. Hey,
you! Open your bag! Open your bag!

(SCREAMING)
Stop her!

27:31.567 --> 27:32.567

27:35.738 --> 27:39.991
Twenty-three Cylons critically
wounded. Fourteen had to be euthanized.

27:41.910 --> 27:45.079
They had casualties, too.
Four human dead.

27:45.164 --> 27:48.333
Who gives a frak about that?
Pardon my language.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.836
The power substation
is crippled.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.296
Almost half the city
is without power

27:53.380 --> 27:55.673
and our best estimates put
the repairs at two weeks.

27:55.758 --> 27:58.468
You still think we're being too
hard on the human population?

27:58.552 --> 28:01.846
We have a very serious,
very straightforward problem.

28:01.930 --> 28:06.559
Either we increase control or
we lose control. That's a fact.

28:06.643 --> 28:09.062
We think it's time
for stronger measures.

28:09.146 --> 28:10.313
We agree.

28:11.607 --> 28:12.607
We agree.

28:15.069 --> 28:17.612
We agree as well.
How about you?

28:20.657 --> 28:22.200
We agree also.

28:22.284 --> 28:23.951
Most of us do, anyway.

28:26.246 --> 28:27.580
Enough.

28:33.045 --> 28:34.087
What's this?

28:34.171 --> 28:35.713
This orders
the summary executions

28:35.798 --> 28:37.548
of all the detainees
listed on the next page.

28:37.633 --> 28:38.883
It requires your signature.

28:38.967 --> 28:39.967
My signature?

28:40.052 --> 28:42.011
You're the President.

28:49.186 --> 28:51.145
Read it later.
Sign now.

28:57.986 --> 28:59.570
Just because you've
decided to do this

28:59.655 --> 29:02.073
doesn't mean you need to
drag him into sin with you.

29:02.157 --> 29:04.075
Don't you lecture
me about sin.

29:04.159 --> 29:05.451
I'm not the one who
committed the first act

29:05.536 --> 29:07.662
of Cylon-on-Cylon
violence in our history.

29:07.746 --> 29:08.830
What's she talking about?

29:08.914 --> 29:11.582
She crushed my head in
with a rock back on Caprica.

29:11.667 --> 29:13.167
Interesting
she didn't tell you.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.670
It was something I had to do.
I'm not proud of it.

29:15.754 --> 29:19.674
This is all very interesting,
very edifying. Sign the order.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.384
You don't need my signature.

29:21.468 --> 29:22.510
D'ANNA:
Well, actually, we do.

29:22.594 --> 29:25.721
We're here as allies and friends of the
legitimate government of the Colonies.

29:25.806 --> 29:28.307
You are the President, so everything
we do requires your signature.

29:28.392 --> 29:30.601
In other words, they're worried
about what God might think

29:30.686 --> 29:34.730
if they commit murder. They're
covering their existential asses.

29:37.985 --> 29:41.154
I won't do it, all right?
I won't do it.

29:41.238 --> 29:43.823
You're going to have to solve
your consciences some other way.

29:43.907 --> 29:46.451
Then we'll find
another president.

29:49.913 --> 29:51.539
Stop this!

29:56.211 --> 29:57.837
This is crazy!

30:15.689 --> 30:17.648
Dear God.
She'll be back.

30:17.733 --> 30:20.735
But if he pulls that
trigger now, you won't.

30:26.158 --> 30:27.366
Sign it!

30:27.451 --> 30:30.703
Sign it! Sign your name! Sign it!

nothing you can do, Gaius.

that paper! It'll be okay.

It's you.

30:42.049 --> 30:43.382
Help me.

30:44.801 --> 30:47.470
You have to sign it. They'll
kill you if you don't.

30:47.554 --> 30:52.016

Sign your name! Sign it!

30:52.100 --> 30:55.102
I can't. I won't.

30:56.396 --> 30:58.105
You can't force...

30:59.107 --> 31:04.111
Sometimes you have to do things you hate,
so you can survive to fight another day.

Raise your right hand
and repeat after me.

31:38.855 --> 31:42.525
I, Sharon Agathon...

31:42.609 --> 31:44.860
...do now pledge my
faith and my loyalty...

31:44.945 --> 31:47.238
...do now pledge my
faith and my loyalty...

31:47.322 --> 31:53.578
...to the protection of
the 12 Colonies of Kobol...

31:53.662 --> 31:57.164
...and will carry out the
lawful orders of my superiors...

31:57.332 --> 32:00.376
...and will carry out the
lawful orders of my superiors...

32:00.669 --> 32:03.546
...as an officer...

32:03.630 --> 32:07.049
...in the Colonial Fleet.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.344
Congratulations,
Lieutenant.

32:13.056 --> 32:15.099
I never thought
I'd live to see the day.

32:15.183 --> 32:16.684
Me, neither.

32:18.186 --> 32:21.147
It looks good on you.
It belongs on you.

32:23.692 --> 32:28.112
This uniform, it means
a lot to me, Sharon.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.823
I know it does, Helo.

32:31.950 --> 32:34.076
It means a lot to me, too.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.497
I won't betray it.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.840
MAN: The bird
checks out, Lieutenant.

32:47.924 --> 32:49.383
Thanks.

32:51.720 --> 32:54.180
Can I ask you a question?
How do you know?

32:54.264 --> 32:57.141
I mean, how do you really
know that you can trust me?

32:57.225 --> 32:58.726
I don't.

33:01.355 --> 33:03.314
That's what trust is.

33:06.068 --> 33:08.319
Good hunting, Lieutenant.

33:25.587 --> 33:27.838
That was really something.

33:30.384 --> 33:32.426
I thought you
might like that.

33:32.511 --> 33:35.513
But you... You didn't
do the twist this time.

33:35.597 --> 33:37.556
What do you call... What's that
deal you did right at the end?

33:37.641 --> 33:39.600
What do you call that?

33:40.769 --> 33:42.853
You mean the swirl?

33:42.938 --> 33:44.188
Oh, the swirl.

33:45.816 --> 33:47.525
Boy, that's
really something.

33:47.609 --> 33:50.778
Well, you said you wanted
something memorable.

33:53.323 --> 33:54.782
How is Saul?

33:56.785 --> 33:58.494
Fine.

33:58.578 --> 34:01.789
And when is his next
meeting with the insurgents?

34:02.958 --> 34:06.210
No point in denying it, Ellen.
We know he's their leader.

34:06.294 --> 34:09.422
Why do you think
we let him out of detention?

34:14.886 --> 34:17.638
I thought it was
because of the twist.

34:18.682 --> 34:21.100
Well, yes, that too,
for sure.

34:21.184 --> 34:23.853
But having the Colonel out
and active with the resistance

34:23.937 --> 34:26.647
presents us with
certain advantages.

34:29.651 --> 34:31.402
I don't know
anything about...

34:31.486 --> 34:36.031
Let's just consider your
denials as read, shall we?

34:36.116 --> 34:39.744
I want a specific place,
I want a specific time

34:39.828 --> 34:43.581
for a very high-level meeting
of the insurgency leadership.

34:43.665 --> 34:47.710
And if I don't get it,
we pick up Saul again,

34:47.794 --> 34:51.130
and this time,
he'll lose more than an eye.

35:01.641 --> 35:05.853
Tomorrow, the Galactica is going
to send two Raptors, several Marines

35:05.937 --> 35:09.440
and a ground liaison officer is gonna
help brief us on the rescue mission

35:09.524 --> 35:11.192
and help coordinate
our evac plans.

35:11.276 --> 35:15.529
I'll be damned. It's really
happening. Who is the liaison officer?

35:17.324 --> 35:18.491
Sharon.

35:18.575 --> 35:21.368
I hope that's
your idea of a joke.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.788
Admiral Adama has given
her a uniform and a billet.

35:23.872 --> 35:27.124
She is a serving officer,
which is more than you can say

35:27.209 --> 35:29.293
about us,
technically speaking.

35:29.377 --> 35:32.171
The old man's lost
his mind all right.

35:33.507 --> 35:34.965
Where's the rendezvous?

35:35.050 --> 35:37.051
They left that up to us.

35:37.135 --> 35:39.303
Okay, here's
my suggestion.

35:40.889 --> 35:44.433
If they jump into Breeder's Canyon,
out here in the southern range...

35:44.518 --> 35:45.518
(KNOCKING)

35:50.565 --> 35:51.857
Come.

35:53.026 --> 35:55.444
Hey, guys.
Hey, Ellen.

35:57.572 --> 36:00.282
Anyway, like I was saying,
if they jump in here,

36:00.367 --> 36:02.326
they won't get picked
up on Cylon dradis.

36:02.410 --> 36:05.663
That's a long way out there, a
lot of ground to cover by foot.

36:05.747 --> 36:08.374
SAM: I realize that. I'm gonna
meet them halfway, right about here.

36:08.458 --> 36:11.669
Now, there's good cover from
the air, it's pretty isolated.

36:11.753 --> 36:13.045
I've gotta be sure.

36:13.129 --> 36:16.757
It may be the most important
meeting we're ever gonna have.

36:16.842 --> 36:19.343
Colonel, I'm sure.
This is the place.

36:19.427 --> 36:21.428
The Cylons will not
find them here.

36:22.597 --> 36:24.348
All right,
give me the map.

36:24.432 --> 36:26.225
Have you got
the message memorized?

36:26.434 --> 36:27.893
All the wireless freqs?

36:28.770 --> 36:31.689
All right, then give me
the message, too.

36:34.025 --> 36:37.403
I'll do that, Saul.
Don't get up.

36:37.487 --> 36:38.737
Thanks.

36:41.241 --> 36:43.534
SAM: Colonel, I've assembled
a team of about six to eight.

36:43.618 --> 36:45.244
We've been out
about half a dozen times.

36:45.328 --> 36:47.538
We have got provisions for a
couple of days if we need them.

36:47.622 --> 36:49.373
We have access
to running water.

36:49.457 --> 36:53.294
I know that place like the back
of my hand. This is gonna work.

36:56.631 --> 36:58.924
Gaius! Gaius!

37:02.470 --> 37:04.221
Did you sign this?

37:05.265 --> 37:07.224
Tell me you didn't sign this,
Gaius. Not now, Mr. Gaeta.

37:07.309 --> 37:08.767
I'm very tired.
This is a death warrant!

37:08.852 --> 37:11.645
Have you seen
the names on this list?

37:11.730 --> 37:13.939
Do you have any idea what
they're about to do out there?

37:14.024 --> 37:15.566
Are you
listening to me?

37:15.650 --> 37:17.860
I didn't have any choice.

37:17.944 --> 37:21.322
What the hell's the matter with you?
There are over 200 names on this list.

37:21.406 --> 37:22.698
Have you even
looked at the names?

37:22.824 --> 37:25.826
Look at the names,
Gaius! I've seen them!

37:28.663 --> 37:31.415
I've seen them, all right?

37:31.499 --> 37:33.792
There was nothing
I could do.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.340
MAN: Let's go!

37:39.424 --> 37:41.050
Move! Move!
Move! Move! Move!

37:41.134 --> 37:44.428
And you do triple digits.
You can do that. Let me see.

37:44.512 --> 37:48.682
Laura Roslin?
Come with us, please.

37:52.312 --> 37:55.272
Killing Tyrol's wife will
only embitter him against us.

37:55.357 --> 37:57.191
He's the head of a labor
union, an organized faction...

37:57.275 --> 37:59.109
Come on, Sharon, let's just
be honest with one another.

37:59.194 --> 38:01.111
In your view, you don't think
there's any reason to kill anyone.

38:01.237 --> 38:02.404
Correct?
Right.

38:02.489 --> 38:05.157
Well, we made
a decision, all of us,

38:05.241 --> 38:07.076
just like when we listened
to you and Caprica Six

38:07.160 --> 38:09.328
when we came here to start
this new and glorious chapter

38:09.412 --> 38:10.704
in Cylon-human relations.

38:10.789 --> 38:13.290
This has nothing to do with
whether or not we execute Cally.

38:13.375 --> 38:15.626
No one enjoys the thought
of mortal death, Boomer.

38:15.710 --> 38:19.213
But she tried to murder you.
Maybe it's Gods' justice.

38:35.730 --> 38:36.939
(GROANS)

38:38.858 --> 38:41.777
Need a lift,
Mr. Vice President?

38:41.861 --> 38:43.028
I guess so.

38:44.030 --> 38:46.490
I haven't seen much of you
lately. Been busy these days, huh?

38:46.574 --> 38:48.951
Well, not much
to do in detention.

38:49.035 --> 38:51.245
How long have
you been held?

38:52.122 --> 38:54.164
Four months, I think.

38:54.249 --> 38:57.167
I told Baltar I wouldn't have any
part of collaborating with the Cylons,

38:57.252 --> 38:59.586
and he got
a little pissed.

38:59.671 --> 39:02.047
He's a little
pissed at me, too.

39:09.139 --> 39:13.183
Jump complete. Right on
target. Okay, hang on, guys.

39:13.268 --> 39:14.476
We're dropping down
to the landing point,

39:14.561 --> 39:16.645
and there's some
heavy turbulence up ahead.

39:24.029 --> 39:26.321
Follow the river.
Make sure you hug the bank.

39:26.406 --> 39:27.406
MAN: Yes, sir.

39:48.178 --> 39:51.555
ATHENA: Okay, once we reach the rendezvous
point, stay back and provide cover.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.647
ATHENA: Go Panthers!

40:02.400 --> 40:03.984
C- Bucks rule!

40:26.591 --> 40:29.968
Hey, Sam,
been a long time.

40:30.053 --> 40:32.888
Funny, I... I feel
like I see you every day.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.184
Come on.

40:57.664 --> 40:58.831
(BEEPING)

40:59.082 --> 41:03.085
Lords, please
don't take her life.

41:04.838 --> 41:07.881
It was my mistake.
Don't punish her for it.

41:10.718 --> 41:13.887
It was an accident,
Kara, nothing more.

41:24.107 --> 41:25.607
Kacey.

41:27.819 --> 41:31.780
Kacey.
Oh, my Gods. Honey.

42:07.483 --> 42:09.943
Let them stretch
their legs for a minute.

42:10.028 --> 42:11.320
Yes, sir!

42:14.073 --> 42:16.450
Let's go!
All right, everybody out!

42:16.534 --> 42:20.495
Five minute rest break!
Come on, move! Everybody out!

42:20.580 --> 42:23.290
Five minute rest break,
max! Let's go!

42:24.292 --> 42:27.294
Come on, five minutes.
Everyone out! Let's go!

42:37.805 --> 42:39.139
Tell me
something, Laura.

42:39.224 --> 42:40.432
MAN: Right up front!

42:40.516 --> 42:44.603
Last year, you tried to
steal an election, didn't you?

42:46.397 --> 42:48.815
Yes, I did, Tom.

42:55.448 --> 42:57.241
I wish you'd gone
through with it.

42:57.325 --> 42:58.617
Me, too.

43:01.329 --> 43:03.956
SAM: We'll wait until nightfall
before we go back to the city.

43:04.040 --> 43:08.001
There's a system of tunnels we've
been using. Our levels under...

43:08.086 --> 43:09.753
You hear that?

43:12.340 --> 43:14.424
ATHENA: Down! Get down!

43:14.509 --> 43:16.301
SAM: Move, take cover!

43:17.470 --> 43:18.470
Go, go, go!

43:23.476 --> 43:25.894
You, over here.

43:35.196 --> 43:38.949
Run. Run,
don't look back. Go!

43:45.540 --> 43:46.748
(PANTING)

43:51.379 --> 43:52.796
Let's go.
