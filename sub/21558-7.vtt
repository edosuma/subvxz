00:15.890 --> 00:18.393
-[engine rumbling]
-[music playing over speakers]

00:33.075 --> 00:35.202
You're alone. [sniffs]

00:35.952 --> 00:37.412
Wanna tell me why?

00:38.580 --> 00:39.581
He's not ready.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.792
The Chaste needs Matt Murdock.

00:43.626 --> 00:46.629
I've tried... but I couldn't convince him.

00:47.339 --> 00:49.549
Bullshit. You let him off the hook.

00:51.509 --> 00:54.554
I've sent you to do things
a lot harder than this, Elektra.

00:54.637 --> 00:56.348
I did everything you said.

00:56.973 --> 01:01.353
I made him give in to
his darkest impulses, but he's stubborn.

01:01.436 --> 01:03.605
I can't change his mind or who he is.

01:03.688 --> 01:06.108
Instead, you let him change who you are.

01:07.900 --> 01:10.278
-That's not what happened.
-'Course it is.

01:11.696 --> 01:16.284
When have you ever come to me with your
tail between your legs, making excuses?

01:18.035 --> 01:20.830
Thought you were
stronger than that, but...

01:21.748 --> 01:27.003
here you are, 'cause... you fell in love.

01:28.880 --> 01:32.134
We're going to war.
We don't have time for that.

01:32.217 --> 01:35.553
For whatever it is
you think you're feeling. [sniffs]

01:36.429 --> 01:38.181
He can't do what you and I do.

01:38.890 --> 01:41.768
The violence is part of him,
but only to a point.

01:41.851 --> 01:43.853
He'll never be able to kill on command.

01:43.936 --> 01:47.274
That doesn't make him good, Ellie.
It makes him weak.

01:49.025 --> 01:51.068
Ah, forget Murdock.

01:51.861 --> 01:55.323
The Hand's moving fast.
Something's coming. We gotta move faster.

01:58.868 --> 02:01.788
Maybe there's another way
to win this war you talk about...

02:03.039 --> 02:04.582
without so much death?

02:05.417 --> 02:09.587
[sighs] Like it or not, Ellie,
more death is coming.

02:10.672 --> 02:14.634
And you and me gotta get out of its way.

03:06.936 --> 03:08.938
[theme music playing]

04:20.718 --> 04:22.387
[sighs]

04:26.349 --> 04:28.184
[Misty] We gotta stop meeting like this.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.895
[sighs]

04:32.480 --> 04:35.858
-I don't remember anything.
-Well, let me refresh your memory.

04:36.693 --> 04:42.740
Two bodies, unidentified.
One headless, the other impaled.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.200
What happened last night?

04:44.284 --> 04:47.119
-Where are the others?
-That's none of your business.

04:47.203 --> 04:50.457
But if you wanna play it coy
and ask to speak to your lawyer,

04:50.540 --> 04:52.625
you should know that they
knocked his ass out, too.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.919
-Where's Danny Rand?
-Danny Rand was there?

04:55.002 --> 04:56.421
[handcuffs rattle]

04:56.504 --> 04:59.382
-[sighs] I need to go.
-And I need some answers.

04:59.466 --> 05:03.010
Look, we'll start out easy.
Who are the bodies?

05:04.554 --> 05:05.972
Who killed them?

05:06.639 --> 05:08.057
Was it you?

05:09.266 --> 05:10.267
No.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.854
Well, it's not like it's completely
out of the question.

05:12.937 --> 05:14.356
You've done it before.

05:14.439 --> 05:15.440
[scoffs]

05:16.148 --> 05:18.318
I know what you're trying to do
and it's not gonna work.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.487
If you didn't kill them, then who did?

05:21.571 --> 05:23.448
You are wasting time, okay?

05:23.531 --> 05:26.701
-People are going to get hurt.
-People are already hurt.

05:26.784 --> 05:28.328
What happened to the others?

05:31.080 --> 05:32.081
They're down the hall.

05:32.164 --> 05:34.417
-Are they okay?
-Looks like it.

05:35.126 --> 05:38.421
Listen, I need you to realize
we are on the same side.

05:38.505 --> 05:41.674
Now, I held up my end of the bargain.
I protected your friends.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.635
It's about damn time you dealt me in.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.722
There's a weird shadow organization.

05:49.098 --> 05:50.433
I've been tracking them.

05:51.183 --> 05:52.394
Not very well.

05:54.186 --> 05:55.312
How many were there?

05:56.856 --> 06:00.485
Just one. The same one
that came after John Raymond.

06:01.110 --> 06:04.906
What kind of person
knocks out you and Luke Cage?

06:06.408 --> 06:07.409
[sighs]

06:08.535 --> 06:10.870
I'm not sure you'd believe me
even if I told you.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.122
Try me.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.710
[phone ringing]

06:21.839 --> 06:22.882
[breathing heavily]

06:25.384 --> 06:28.220
-Whoa, Matt. Hold on.
-Foggy? Where are we?

06:28.304 --> 06:29.972
Harlem precinct. Private office.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.098
[panting]

06:31.182 --> 06:34.519
And if we're painting the whole picture,
you look like shit.

06:35.186 --> 06:38.189
-They took your shirt for blood samples.
-Right.

06:38.272 --> 06:40.107
Claire gave you a quick look.
Nothing's broken.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.569
But the cops have a lot of questions.

06:43.570 --> 06:47.490
-I wasn't wearing the suit.
-I know. There is a God after all.

06:48.616 --> 06:51.160
Oh, God, I need to go. He's in danger.

06:51.243 --> 06:54.205
-Who?
-Danny Rand. Uh, they took him.

06:54.288 --> 06:57.083
-The billionaire?
-[sighs] Stick.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.421
She killed Stick.

07:05.925 --> 07:08.385
[sniffles and sighs heavily]

07:12.181 --> 07:13.725
Yeah, Danny. They took Danny.

07:14.517 --> 07:17.144
And then now,
I have to save him from the Hand.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.647
You are in no position to save anybody.

07:19.730 --> 07:22.275
They haven't pressed charges,
but they found you with two dead bodies.

07:22.358 --> 07:24.193
I don't have a choice.
He's the Iron Fist.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.362
I'm not gonna pretend
to know what that means.

07:26.446 --> 07:30.450
Foggy, the person who did this,
who, uh, who took Danny...

07:31.659 --> 07:32.785
It's Elektra.

07:34.245 --> 07:36.539
-Your ex-girlfriend?
-I understand how it sounds.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.875
-She's dead.
-She's not. Not anymore.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.710
The Hand took her.
They did something to her.

07:40.793 --> 07:43.546
-Whatever she is, she's not herself.
-Matt, you need to take a breath.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.631
-You sound insane.
-I don't care if you believe me.

07:45.715 --> 07:49.469
Whatever they're gonna do with Danny Rand,
it is not good for anyone.

07:53.055 --> 07:55.266
-Mr. Murdock.
-Yes. Is that you, Detective?

07:55.349 --> 07:56.392
You're up.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.437
I've got one of your clients
scared shitless across the hallway,

07:59.521 --> 08:01.731
and the other one passed out,

08:01.814 --> 08:03.941
so I'm gonna need for you
to answer a few questions.

08:04.025 --> 08:08.571
Oh, well, unfortunately, whatever happened
is protected by attorney-client privilege.

08:09.446 --> 08:12.199
That's cute, but cut the shit.

08:12.283 --> 08:15.286
'Cause we both know
you're not just a lawyer in all this.

08:15.369 --> 08:16.412
You're something more.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.623
As of right now,
you're a person of interest.

08:18.706 --> 08:20.457
A witness to a crime.

08:20.542 --> 08:21.584
A witness?

08:23.127 --> 08:25.421
What, do you want me to describe
how it sounded, Detective?

08:25.505 --> 08:28.550
Perhaps you didn't hear me
when I said, "Cut the shit."

08:29.300 --> 08:30.802
Now I hear they took Danny Rand.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.887
A person with that high of a profile?

08:32.970 --> 08:37.058
If this falls back on you...
it's gonna make your life miserable.

08:37.725 --> 08:40.436
Look, uh... [sighs]
I wanna help.

08:40.520 --> 08:44.607
I can't say much, apart from the fact
that he is in way over his head.

08:44.691 --> 08:45.692
And we need to help him.

08:47.401 --> 08:49.445
Mr. Murdock, all due respect,

08:49.529 --> 08:51.823
you need to start worrying
about helping yourself.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.247
His pulse is up a little.

09:02.374 --> 09:03.292
Is that good?

09:03.375 --> 09:06.879
Long as
it doesn't spike irregularly, sure.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.343
What do you think it was?

09:13.510 --> 09:14.887
Some kinda drug.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.224
They found a weird incense
at the crime scene.

09:21.603 --> 09:25.231
His skin's what's bulletproof.
The rest of him is not.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.569
You think Danny would have survived it?

09:31.779 --> 09:33.280
I don't know, Colleen.

09:37.952 --> 09:42.123
Okay, we need to find out what happened.
How long until he wakes up?

09:43.124 --> 09:46.543
Could be an hour. Could be a week.

09:46.628 --> 09:47.920
[chuckles]

09:51.340 --> 09:52.466
I know.

09:53.676 --> 09:54.761
[Colleen sniffles]

09:58.222 --> 10:00.683
God, how the hell did we get here?

10:02.101 --> 10:03.269
With them?

10:06.522 --> 10:09.400
I did everything I could
to avoid people with abilities.

10:10.610 --> 10:11.903
Quit my job.

10:13.112 --> 10:14.530
Moved my ass uptown.

10:15.948 --> 10:18.492
-And how'd that work out?
-You tell me.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.913
Is sidekick a good look on me?

10:21.996 --> 10:25.082
They are fighting a good fight.
You're doing it, too.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.167
Not like them.

10:28.377 --> 10:29.921
And even Jessica.

10:30.004 --> 10:35.134
There are people who run from the fire,
and there are people who run into it.

10:35.718 --> 10:36.928
Dumb people.

10:38.179 --> 10:42.058
Okay, you said
I was the foundation, right?

10:44.310 --> 10:45.436
Look in the mirror.

10:46.437 --> 10:47.647
Even before you met Luke,

10:47.730 --> 10:52.484
you weren't the type who could just...
stand by and watch.

10:53.736 --> 10:54.654
Were you?

11:00.993 --> 11:02.119
Claire?

11:04.246 --> 11:05.247
Hey.

11:06.165 --> 11:09.961
-Where am I?
-You're in the precinct. How do you feel?

11:10.044 --> 11:11.545
[sighs] What happened to Danny?

11:14.006 --> 11:15.007
Is he alive?

11:21.848 --> 11:23.015
[Claire sighs]

11:23.099 --> 11:24.892
-[subway train passing]
-[horn blaring]

11:35.945 --> 11:38.489
This is not how we do business.

11:39.323 --> 11:40.407
It is now.

11:40.491 --> 11:45.162
[in Japanese] Black Sky or not,
there are three of us and one of you.

11:45.246 --> 11:46.622
[in English] Is that a challenge?

11:46.705 --> 11:50.209
We will do what is needed
to preserve our organization.

11:50.292 --> 11:51.961
This is not our first coup.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.089
It is your first without the substance.

11:57.174 --> 11:59.468
Is that a gamble you're willing to take?

12:03.430 --> 12:06.433
The Hand is a global organization.

12:06.517 --> 12:09.603
For years,
Alexandra fostered relationships

12:09.686 --> 12:13.941
with everything from crime lords
to corporate partners.

12:14.025 --> 12:15.151
Corporate partners?

12:16.235 --> 12:18.404
How do we explain her death to them?

12:18.487 --> 12:21.323
[sighs] There's no need for explanations.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.699
[in Japanese] What?

12:23.284 --> 12:27.789
[in English] These relationships
grant us invisibility in our operations.

12:27.872 --> 12:31.708
Our back-room accords.
Our political affiliations.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.669
This gives us power.

12:34.796 --> 12:37.548
This isn't power.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.594
Living underground. In hiding.

12:42.678 --> 12:44.680
[Bakuto] You know nothing of power.

12:45.264 --> 12:48.392
You didn't exist
until Alexandra gave you life.

12:51.728 --> 12:53.522
Didn't I?

12:53.605 --> 12:57.443
It's not what you did,
it's how you did it.

12:58.194 --> 13:02.364
The Hand has survived this long because
we, above all else, have been astute.

13:03.532 --> 13:07.661
Oh. Well, this may come
as a bit of a shock,

13:07.744 --> 13:09.580
but I don't care about the Hand.

13:10.247 --> 13:11.999
I care about the substance.

13:12.834 --> 13:16.545
Because from now on,
nothing will stand in my way.

13:16.628 --> 13:18.214
Not even death.

13:22.844 --> 13:25.096
-You guys okay?
-[sighs] I'll live.

13:25.679 --> 13:28.099
I don't suppose either
of you snuck a flask in here.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.350
[chuckles]

13:29.433 --> 13:31.143
How are we gonna get out of this?

13:31.227 --> 13:32.937
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

13:34.563 --> 13:35.940
Three of you wanna sit?

13:39.276 --> 13:40.694
Suit yourself.

13:42.196 --> 13:45.241
We've had no luck identifying the bodies
we found in the warehouse with you.

13:45.324 --> 13:48.160
And though you two have
colorful histories,

13:48.244 --> 13:49.996
I have reminded the NYPD

13:50.079 --> 13:51.705
-we have no evidence...
-[Strieber] Yet.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.374
...to suggest that you were responsible.

13:53.457 --> 13:55.376
Now, I trust Detective Knight,

13:55.459 --> 13:58.212
and she says that,
although you're being tight-lipped,

13:58.295 --> 14:01.798
the best way to proceed is to treat you
as witnesses and not suspects.

14:01.883 --> 14:04.760
You have information that can
fill in the gaps. We need it.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.053
[Strieber] Our task force

14:06.136 --> 14:08.764
has been tracking
a mysterious crime syndicate for months.

14:08.847 --> 14:11.058
They move fast and cover their tracks

14:11.142 --> 14:13.269
and often with the blood
of innocent people.

14:13.352 --> 14:16.022
-[Misty] People are in danger.
-Captain, my clients are exhausted

14:16.105 --> 14:17.523
and under emotional distress.

14:17.606 --> 14:19.400
I'm sure you understand
they need to go home.

14:19.483 --> 14:22.862
And, see, I'm not sure you understand
the severity of the situation.

14:22.945 --> 14:26.323
Everyone who's come in contact
with these assholes turns up dead.

14:26.407 --> 14:30.327
Now, either you help us or I start
clearing out a couple of jail cells.

14:30.411 --> 14:31.871
They call themselves the Hand.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.750
They're real. They're murderers.

14:37.919 --> 14:39.670
And they took Danny Rand.

14:39.753 --> 14:42.006
-But what do they want with him?
-[Luke] I don't know.

14:42.089 --> 14:44.341
They've been after him for a while now.

14:44.425 --> 14:45.801
Who knows what they'll do next.

14:46.385 --> 14:48.888
Look, when criminals feel like
they're winning, they get sloppy.

14:48.971 --> 14:50.014
This could be good for us.

14:50.097 --> 14:51.640
No, not these criminals.

14:51.723 --> 14:54.560
They don't get sloppy.
They just get more dangerous.

14:54.643 --> 14:56.979
It has to be us.
We can take care of this.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.190
"We"? There is no "we."

14:59.273 --> 15:01.901
Vigilantes don't have jurisdiction.
The NYPD does.

15:01.984 --> 15:03.819
[Misty]
Luke, you don't need to protect us.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.197
Tell us where to find the Hand.
We can take it from there.

15:06.989 --> 15:07.990
I can't.

15:09.783 --> 15:10.867
Well, that's it. Okay.

15:10.952 --> 15:13.745
Someone call DA Tower.
I'm tired of doing this the hard way.

15:13.829 --> 15:17.333
These people don't tell us what to do.
We are the law here.

15:17.416 --> 15:18.960
Or has New York
gone completely insane?

15:19.043 --> 15:23.047
Captain, before you make any calls,
I'd like to sidebar with my clients.

15:23.130 --> 15:26.508
Oh, you can do that... after I book them
for obstruction. And you.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.177
Just a word. In private.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.513
I would like to explain to them how best
to cooperate in building your case.

15:38.395 --> 15:40.481
Well, I hope they like
what you have to say.

15:40.564 --> 15:45.486
Otherwise, and I warn you, I'm putting you
in a room with two super-powered people.

15:45.569 --> 15:47.738
Last I heard,
they still have legal rights.

15:47.821 --> 15:49.615
-You know what, son--
-[Misty] Captain...

15:52.284 --> 15:53.910
I think we should let them.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.038
Just trust me.

15:58.749 --> 16:01.752
Okay. But don't make me regret this.

16:07.591 --> 16:08.759
Thank you, Captain.

16:18.727 --> 16:23.524
Uh, Detective... would you mind
if I grab Mr. Murdock for a moment?

16:24.984 --> 16:26.318
I'll just be a minute.

16:26.402 --> 16:27.819
-Okay.
-Thank you.

16:27.903 --> 16:28.904
[Matt clears throat]

16:30.822 --> 16:32.283
-Hi.
-What's going on?

16:32.949 --> 16:35.619
[sighs] You mind if I explain later?

16:35.702 --> 16:37.496
Well, it looks pretty bad.

16:37.579 --> 16:40.416
It's only a matter of time before
they start to put things together.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.126
Yeah, I know, I know.

16:43.044 --> 16:44.336
[scoffs] God.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.588
I don't understand.
After everything you've worked for?

16:47.173 --> 16:49.341
You were finally rebuilding your life.

16:51.552 --> 16:52.928
Karen...

16:53.970 --> 16:55.306
this is my life.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.851
I have to go.

17:02.479 --> 17:03.480
[sighs]

17:23.375 --> 17:24.460
[sighs]

17:33.385 --> 17:36.347
Danny's prepared his whole life
for this fight.

17:39.015 --> 17:40.059
He's the Iron Fist.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.560
[chuckles]

17:42.644 --> 17:45.647
And he will tell that
to anyone who will listen.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.693
[sighs] I know him.

17:49.776 --> 17:54.448
Deep down inside... he is still
just a kid looking for his family.

17:58.869 --> 17:59.870
With me...

18:01.747 --> 18:03.124
and with them...

18:05.209 --> 18:06.877
almost had it.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.177
Can we talk?

18:15.261 --> 18:16.262
[Luke clears throat]

18:18.680 --> 18:20.099
About?

18:20.182 --> 18:24.728
Look, I brought you in to help one family.
But this shit is getting out of hand.

18:24.811 --> 18:26.813
I know. It's already out of hand.

18:26.897 --> 18:28.023
I know you're trying to do good,

18:28.107 --> 18:30.859
but there is a difference
between being a hero and a martyr.

18:31.443 --> 18:34.821
You think that's why I'm putting
everyone at risk, because of my pride?

18:36.365 --> 18:39.535
I don't know what to think.
Maybe you wanna be a cop again.

18:39.618 --> 18:42.371
The truth is,
I've lost sight of your plan.

18:42.454 --> 18:45.040
-There is no plan.
-I can tell.

18:46.708 --> 18:49.503
-Look, Luke, I am your friend.
-I know, Misty.

18:51.213 --> 18:52.923
That's why I'm trying to protect you.

18:53.590 --> 18:55.926
Let me. Please.

19:03.684 --> 19:04.976
[door closes]

19:06.853 --> 19:08.897
[elevator rattling]

19:28.292 --> 19:30.294
[Murakami in Japanese] I don't trust her.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.047
What if we stop her...

19:35.257 --> 19:38.760
before she undoes everything we've done?

19:39.678 --> 19:42.431
[in English] The Iron Fist is being led
to the door.

19:42.514 --> 19:45.141
We're closer than we've ever been.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.229
[in Japanese] She is not one of us.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.397
[in English] It does not matter.

19:50.481 --> 19:54.526
She has the ability
to bring us a new beginning.

19:54.610 --> 19:57.279
And after that,
anything can happen.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.351
[gate opening]

20:47.078 --> 20:48.914
[Danny] What are we doing down here?

20:49.998 --> 20:51.750
[Elektra] That depends on you.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.472
Oh, my God.

21:08.892 --> 21:10.394
We don't have a lot of time.

21:10.977 --> 21:12.354
If they're pressing charges,

21:12.438 --> 21:13.647
we want a lawyer who isn't you.

21:13.730 --> 21:15.441
-That's not why we're here.
-You're right.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.818
We're here because your ex
almost killed every one of us.

21:17.901 --> 21:19.903
Yeah, did she take Danny
or did she kill Danny?

21:19.986 --> 21:21.613
I don't know.
But if what Stick said is true,

21:21.697 --> 21:24.450
and they didn't leave his body,
we have to believe they need him alive.

21:24.533 --> 21:25.826
I think she saved him.

21:25.909 --> 21:28.161
When you burst in,
the old man was trying to slice him open.

21:28.245 --> 21:31.290
Well, he must've known what the Hand
was planning on doing with the Iron Fist.

21:33.041 --> 21:35.085
-Which is what?
-We still don't know.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.964
[sighs] Where did they take Danny?

21:39.715 --> 21:41.132
Midland Circle makes the most sense.

21:43.176 --> 21:44.135
[Luke] What from the architect?

21:44.219 --> 21:45.596
He was planning on
blowing up the building.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.473
Collapsing it straight down into the hole.

21:47.556 --> 21:49.308
-They're still digging?
-No. Digging stopped,

21:49.391 --> 21:51.977
but there's some structure,
some dome-shaped thing--

21:52.060 --> 21:53.562
We found blueprints inside the piano.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.731
-The what?
-Don't ask.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.107
If they think Danny's a key,

21:57.190 --> 21:59.651
maybe whatever it is he unlocks
is in that structure.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.320
Oh, my God, this is the dumbest...

22:01.403 --> 22:03.489
The question is,
what are we gonna do about it?

22:03.572 --> 22:05.156
I mean, I just got out of jail.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.658
They don't know who you are, Matt.

22:07.576 --> 22:08.619
[knocking at door]

22:08.702 --> 22:11.079
-Jesus! Give us a minute!
-It's not the cops.

22:11.663 --> 22:12.998
-Hey.
-Can I borrow you?

22:13.081 --> 22:14.624
-Not right now.
-Yes, right now.

22:16.042 --> 22:17.461
Just give me a minute.

22:18.504 --> 22:21.047
-Matt, I need you to hear me out.
-Can you please make this fast?

22:21.131 --> 22:24.092
I don't think you understand
the gravity of your current situation.

22:24.175 --> 22:25.927
Your real life and your other life

22:26.011 --> 22:28.263
are two trains dangerously
close to colliding right now.

22:28.346 --> 22:29.347
I am well aware.

22:29.431 --> 22:31.182
Did you hear what that cop said?

22:31.266 --> 22:33.226
If you're ever investigated,
you lose everything.

22:33.309 --> 22:34.520
They'd reopen every case.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.772
Matter of fact, I come with you.
We both get disbarred.

22:36.855 --> 22:39.649
I'm sorry. I don't have time for this now.
The entire city is in danger.

22:39.733 --> 22:43.069
I know. And I'm not dumb enough
to think I can try and stop you.

22:43.153 --> 22:46.948
I'm here because I'm trying to help you
keep your two lives separate.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.284
So they don't lump you in
with Mr. Bulletproof

22:49.367 --> 22:50.869
and Super Joan Jett in there.

22:50.952 --> 22:52.954
-You understand?
-Yeah, I do.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.915
Okay, good.

22:54.998 --> 22:57.626
'Cause the people in this building
need to always,

22:57.709 --> 23:00.170
and only, see you as a lawyer.

23:00.712 --> 23:01.713
I know.

23:03.256 --> 23:04.257
What is this?

23:04.341 --> 23:07.094
I still have a key to your place,
so I brought you a change of clothes.

23:08.136 --> 23:10.013
-Okay, thank you.
-Anytime.

23:10.096 --> 23:11.807
-All right.
-That's what family's for.

23:14.350 --> 23:17.062
[Luke and Jessica
speaking indistinctly]

23:30.909 --> 23:34.370
[Luke] Look, Jess and I have been talking,
and no matter what it takes...

23:34.955 --> 23:37.916
no matter what we have to tell these cops,
we gotta get to Midland Circle.

23:37.999 --> 23:41.169
Okay. So long as we're on the same page.

23:41.252 --> 23:43.213
Here's my official legal advice.

23:47.634 --> 23:50.053
[sighs] You need to get something
out of those three.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.388
Luke and Jessica
think they're protecting us.

23:52.473 --> 23:54.516
And the lawyer,
God knows what his play is.

23:54.600 --> 23:57.811
I don't care. This is the kinda case
that makes or breaks a career.

23:57.894 --> 23:59.730
And I'm not talking about mine.

24:00.313 --> 24:03.108
Now, you track down and stop
this organization, whoever they are,

24:03.191 --> 24:05.902
and brass will be knocking each other over
trying to shake your hand.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.822
But you don't break this case,

24:08.905 --> 24:10.240
they'll remember that, too.

24:10.782 --> 24:12.493
-[crashing]
-[alarm blaring]

24:12.576 --> 24:13.577
[people clamoring]

24:21.084 --> 24:22.418
Shit!

24:29.300 --> 24:31.011
Do you recognize that language?

24:32.513 --> 24:34.640
That's why you dragged me down here?

24:34.723 --> 24:35.974
To be a translator?

24:36.642 --> 24:37.934
What does it say?

24:38.727 --> 24:41.605
[Danny] I've seen this language before,
but there's a lot I didn't learn.

24:43.023 --> 24:44.608
A lot they didn't tell me.

24:47.110 --> 24:50.238
Besides, even if I could read it...

24:51.573 --> 24:54.492
[scoffs] I have no idea what this is.

24:55.243 --> 24:57.788
Well, lucky for us, I do.

24:59.330 --> 25:03.627
Years ago, someone like you
used their abilities to seal this.

25:03.710 --> 25:07.338
-How do you know?
-Alexandra talked. I listened.

25:08.632 --> 25:12.302
In doing so, they guaranteed that
only one thing could open it.

25:14.345 --> 25:15.346
Hmm.

25:17.057 --> 25:18.474
Another Iron Fist.

25:21.144 --> 25:24.314
Behind that door is the true power
of the Hand.

25:26.942 --> 25:28.902
And you expect me to open it for you?

25:30.236 --> 25:34.365
I swore an oath to my masters
to protect K'un-Lun and destroy the Hand.

25:36.242 --> 25:37.911
I also had masters.

25:39.037 --> 25:42.415
But I'm free now.
And you can be as well.

25:54.469 --> 25:56.554
I want three units scouring
a ten-block radius.

25:56.638 --> 25:58.181
They can't be far. And, Detective--

25:58.264 --> 26:00.225
I thought Luke was smarter
than this. I thought--

26:00.308 --> 26:02.060
If you want a chance
to save yourself here,

26:02.143 --> 26:04.855
you need to reconsider how well
you know these vigilantes. That clear?

26:05.981 --> 26:07.065
Find them.

27:10.253 --> 27:11.796
[siren wailing]

27:11.880 --> 27:13.673
Shit.

27:19.554 --> 27:21.097
They got an APB out on us.

27:23.016 --> 27:24.810
[scoffs] They think you guys kidnapped me.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.102
[scoffs] Great.

27:26.687 --> 27:28.021
We're still 20 blocks away.

27:28.104 --> 27:29.439
We need to stay off the streets.

27:29.522 --> 27:31.024
Should we take a cab?

27:32.608 --> 27:34.778
-They kept my wallet.
-Yeah, me, too.

27:34.861 --> 27:35.862
Shit.

27:36.697 --> 27:38.448
Whatever we do, we need to do it fast.

27:40.283 --> 27:41.284
Um...

27:43.119 --> 27:44.329
[chiming]

28:28.414 --> 28:29.750
It's been a long week.

28:36.172 --> 28:37.173
[sighs]

28:37.257 --> 28:39.259
[indistinct chatter]

28:41.136 --> 28:42.387
[knocking on window]

28:42.470 --> 28:43.930
Foggy! Hey!

28:44.765 --> 28:46.099
-They're gone!
-I know.

28:46.182 --> 28:47.726
They think Luke and Jessica took Matt?

28:47.809 --> 28:50.020
-That can't be true, right?
-What do you think?

28:50.686 --> 28:51.897
Well, come on.

28:52.731 --> 28:55.150
I think Matt's never done
a damn thing he didn't want to.

28:55.233 --> 28:57.568
-Yeah.
-[sighs] I don't get it. I don't get it.

28:57.652 --> 29:00.030
He was so close to moving on.
Why would he risk it again?

29:00.113 --> 29:02.490
Because he has to.
Because this thing is huge.

29:02.573 --> 29:04.700
And because... I told him to.

29:04.785 --> 29:08.038
-You did what?
-Don't worry. He didn't go as Matt.

29:08.872 --> 29:10.123
You gave him the suit?

29:10.206 --> 29:12.458
[stammers] I wasn't trying
to open the door for him.

29:12.542 --> 29:14.585
I was giving him a chance to close it.
For good.

29:14.669 --> 29:17.547
Look, whatever this is, when it's done,

29:17.630 --> 29:19.549
-I think we'll get Matt back.
-[sighs]

29:25.138 --> 29:26.556
Whole precinct's on alert now

29:26.639 --> 29:29.725
and pretty soon every cop in the city
is gonna be on the hunt.

29:29.810 --> 29:32.395
So if you know where he's going,
you need to tell me.

29:33.271 --> 29:34.773
I don't know.

29:34.856 --> 29:38.819
But I'm pretty sure wherever Luke is,
it's where he needs to be.

29:38.902 --> 29:40.278
[scoffs]

29:41.112 --> 29:44.073
Are you ready to wait a couple years
before you can see him again?

29:44.157 --> 29:45.408
'Cause you know and I both know

29:45.491 --> 29:48.954
it's gonna be damn near impossible
for him to get away with this shit.

29:49.537 --> 29:51.497
You know what his true north is?

29:53.208 --> 29:57.128
Doing the right thing,
no matter the consequence.

29:57.212 --> 30:00.590
Far as I can tell, he's finally
finding his place in the world.

30:02.968 --> 30:07.305
Look, I just don't want to see him lose
everything that he's worked hard for.

30:09.599 --> 30:10.851
I'm just trying to help.

30:12.018 --> 30:14.562
Harlem can't afford to lose him.

30:16.522 --> 30:20.776
You know, on his first day out of lockup,
you took him on a walk...

30:22.070 --> 30:26.366
and told him that he was capable
of turning this city around.

30:27.117 --> 30:28.576
Of saving somebody.

30:29.995 --> 30:32.247
That's exactly what he's trying
to do right now.

30:32.330 --> 30:35.291
It may not be convenient
for you or the NYPD.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.043
It's really not convenient for me.

30:38.794 --> 30:40.671
But we're damn lucky he's the kind of man

30:40.755 --> 30:42.966
that doesn't let anything
stand in his way.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.306
Wait a minute,
where's the chick with the sword?

30:51.724 --> 30:53.351
Oh, shit.

30:57.480 --> 31:00.400
[Jessica] We have time
to grab a drink? Or three?

31:01.317 --> 31:03.403
-Having second thoughts?
-No.

31:04.695 --> 31:06.822
Maybe. You?

31:07.573 --> 31:08.574
No.

31:09.868 --> 31:10.911
Maybe.

31:12.412 --> 31:16.416
-So how do we get in?
-Back entrance. Parking garage.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.502
I came looking for Danny
a couple days ago. That's how I got in.

31:19.586 --> 31:22.463
A couple days?
God, that feels like three weeks ago.

31:22.547 --> 31:23.798
Yeah, tell me about it.

31:26.051 --> 31:27.343
There it is again.

31:29.595 --> 31:30.596
All right.

31:40.023 --> 31:42.608
-[Luke] What's wrong?
-[Daredevil] We're not alone.

31:43.234 --> 31:45.403
[sighs] MJ deep cut.

31:45.486 --> 31:47.613
-How many?
-Three. Armed.

31:47.697 --> 31:49.865
-Just three?
-Not just any three.

31:52.743 --> 31:55.663
-Is that the only way in?
-Unfortunately.

32:05.381 --> 32:06.841
We're here for Danny Rand.

32:08.969 --> 32:11.346
The Iron Fist belongs to us.

32:11.429 --> 32:13.389
Well, we're not leaving here without him.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.518
Then I guess you're not leaving.

32:19.187 --> 32:21.147
[clicking]

32:51.386 --> 32:52.845
We don't have to fight.

32:53.888 --> 32:54.889
[sighs]

32:56.557 --> 32:58.434
Fighting is all the Hand knows.

33:03.064 --> 33:04.149
I'm not the Hand.

33:06.067 --> 33:08.694
We've been used. Both of us.

33:09.487 --> 33:12.032
We've been raised
to fight someone else's war.

33:12.115 --> 33:14.617
But you and I, we're the same.

33:15.951 --> 33:18.371
All we want to decide is our own futures.

33:18.454 --> 33:20.748
You sound like your master, Alexandra.

33:21.666 --> 33:23.084
But neither of you know what I want.

33:24.669 --> 33:26.004
Alexandra's dead.

33:27.297 --> 33:28.589
I killed her.

33:29.174 --> 33:30.758
That's what I wanted.

33:33.219 --> 33:37.515
And you?
You wanted more than K'un-Lun.

33:37.598 --> 33:41.061
That's why you abandoned it, isn't it?

33:45.023 --> 33:48.318
They told me all about you.
About your struggle.

33:49.777 --> 33:51.321
But what was it for?

33:51.987 --> 33:53.698
You're still at this alone.

33:54.282 --> 33:56.659
Especially since you know
that your precious elders

33:56.742 --> 33:58.911
chose to keep you in the dark.

34:00.330 --> 34:01.664
Just like mine did.

34:05.043 --> 34:09.004
The only difference between us
is that I took my destiny.

34:10.214 --> 34:12.091
You ran away from yours.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.177
Maybe you're right.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.347
Maybe I did run.

34:19.099 --> 34:22.185
Maybe there were things in this world
that I wasn't ready to confront.

34:25.480 --> 34:26.606
But you...

34:29.150 --> 34:30.693
you are not one of them.

34:30.776 --> 34:32.362
[grunting]

34:37.908 --> 34:39.327
[grunting]

34:55.260 --> 34:57.512
[grunting]

34:59.305 --> 35:01.516
I should warn you,
I'm stronger than I look.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.160
[Luke grunts]

35:20.743 --> 35:21.911
[grunting]

35:26.749 --> 35:27.583
[grunts]

36:04.745 --> 36:05.746
[screams]

36:12.253 --> 36:13.379
[Jessica grunts]

36:15.423 --> 36:17.132
-What the...
-[Gao grunts]

36:17.217 --> 36:18.759
[Jessica shouts]

36:39.154 --> 36:40.865
-[grunts] Not today.
-[grunts]

36:56.005 --> 36:56.964
[in Japanese] Light! Now!

36:57.923 --> 36:59.300
[grunting]

37:27.202 --> 37:28.454
Everyone okay?

37:29.079 --> 37:31.666
[panting] Okay is long gone.

37:34.126 --> 37:35.044
Hey.

37:36.379 --> 37:37.713
You should be at the precinct.

37:38.631 --> 37:39.924
You're welcome.

37:46.013 --> 37:48.015
[grunting]

37:57.275 --> 37:58.484
[groaning]

38:00.320 --> 38:02.280
I know what you want,
but you're not gonna get it.

38:03.864 --> 38:07.452
Because unlike you,
my master taught me loyalty.

38:07.535 --> 38:10.037
Ah, that's why
you're still chained to your master.

38:10.120 --> 38:11.289
[grunts and groans]

38:11.372 --> 38:14.500
You're gonna fail here,
just as you failed K'un-Lun.

38:15.125 --> 38:16.544
[Danny grunting]

38:25.636 --> 38:27.305
[Danny breathing heavily]

38:27.388 --> 38:31.100
You should've heard the way
they screamed when I killed them.

38:38.148 --> 38:39.567
[Danny grunts]

38:46.741 --> 38:48.242
[Luke] They gone, Matt?

38:48.326 --> 38:49.869
Yeah, for now.

38:49.952 --> 38:51.036
What's in the bag?

38:51.621 --> 38:54.206
I'm here to save Danny and make sure
no one gets hurt ever again.

38:54.289 --> 38:56.917
-How does that answer my question?
-[Colleen] We have to go.

38:57.001 --> 38:58.168
What's in the bag?

38:58.753 --> 38:59.754
[Daredevil] She's right.

39:01.339 --> 39:02.507
[tires screech]

39:03.716 --> 39:04.550
Hold it.

39:05.551 --> 39:07.302
-Claire?
-What happened here?

39:07.387 --> 39:08.346
No time to explain.

39:08.429 --> 39:09.972
-Like hell there isn't.
-Please.

39:10.515 --> 39:14.309
You got a minute before the full force
of the NYPD is here.

39:14.394 --> 39:16.103
So I need you to answer this fast.

39:17.688 --> 39:19.440
How long you want me to stall 'em?

39:27.615 --> 39:28.741
[grunts]

39:30.451 --> 39:31.786
[breathing heavily]

39:34.580 --> 39:35.623
[Danny grunting]

39:39.209 --> 39:40.628
[panting]

39:42.129 --> 39:43.464
[grunting]

39:52.306 --> 39:53.223
[Danny screams]

39:59.439 --> 40:01.190
[indistinct chatter]

40:03.401 --> 40:04.402
That can't be good.

40:04.485 --> 40:06.028
-Nope.
-[cell phone ringing]

40:10.950 --> 40:14.119
Hey. Yeah, it's Karen.
Yeah, our lights, too.

40:14.203 --> 40:16.205
-[alarm sounding]
-[Luke] Keep moving.

40:16.288 --> 40:18.749
-[Daredevil] Cops coming.
-[Jessica panting]

40:24.589 --> 40:27.216
-[Colleen] Wow.
-You have no idea.

40:31.429 --> 40:33.097
[sirens wailing in distance]

40:42.147 --> 40:43.524
Freeze!

40:44.525 --> 40:45.443
Shit.

40:45.526 --> 40:47.820
-Hold your fire.
-[officer on radio] Copy that.

40:48.571 --> 40:50.740
Knight, where have you been?

40:50.823 --> 40:53.826
I had a feeling they were here, Captain,
so I came down.

40:53.909 --> 40:55.953
-[Strieber] Well, are they?
-[Misty] Yeah.

40:56.036 --> 40:58.372
But by the time I got here,
lights went out, they were gone.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.375
Hey, Cap!
We got movement in the stairwell.

41:04.378 --> 41:05.796
[straining]

41:07.089 --> 41:08.007
[officer] Shit.

41:14.805 --> 41:16.474
-Where's Danny?
-Yeah, where is Danny?

41:18.392 --> 41:21.103
There's a structure underground.
He's gotta be there.

41:21.186 --> 41:23.355
-[Jessica] How do we get to it?
-Figuring that out.

41:23.438 --> 41:25.650
Hey, I don't like it here.
Not at all.

41:25.733 --> 41:26.692
Too late.

41:28.235 --> 41:30.070
There's an elevator this way.
It goes deep.

41:30.154 --> 41:31.614
-Think he's down there?
-Let's find out.

41:31.697 --> 41:33.198
[Colleen] Just one more thing.

41:35.075 --> 41:36.368
[breathing heavily]

41:36.451 --> 41:37.452
What is that?

41:40.706 --> 41:41.916
[sighs]

41:41.999 --> 41:43.000
This is not happening.

41:43.083 --> 41:45.836
We grab Danny and we get him out,
but if we don't end the Hand...

41:46.879 --> 41:48.589
sooner or later, they'll come after us.

41:48.673 --> 41:50.633
-Oh, my God.
-This is not happening.

41:50.716 --> 41:53.302
[sighs] The architect,
he was your guy, right?

41:53.385 --> 41:54.720
Don't put this shit on me.

41:54.804 --> 41:57.222
No. He had this plan
on how to take this thing out.

41:57.306 --> 41:59.349
Okay, I wanna save Danny, too,
but not like this.

41:59.433 --> 42:01.936
They'll have us on obstruction of justice
and domestic terrorism.

42:02.019 --> 42:04.396
This isn't just about Danny.
It's about New York.

42:04.479 --> 42:08.275
You know these people, Claire.
They're relentless.

42:08.901 --> 42:11.821
There's no guarantee that exploding
this building ends their organization.

42:11.904 --> 42:14.532
It kills their leaders
and cuts the head off the snake.

42:14.615 --> 42:17.618
Hey, we're here to save lives,
not take them.

42:17.702 --> 42:20.830
-These people aren't really alive.
-[Daredevil] Plus the building is empty.

42:22.581 --> 42:23.958
There's no one else here.
It's us and them.

42:25.334 --> 42:26.418
You're okay with this?

42:26.501 --> 42:31.048
I mean, no, but... she's right.
And the architect knew it.

42:31.131 --> 42:33.801
The only way to end this, to save the city
from whatever's coming,

42:33.884 --> 42:35.636
is to bring this building down.

42:35.720 --> 42:37.555
So unless there are any objections...

42:42.935 --> 42:45.020
then that's exactly what we're gonna do.

42:46.939 --> 42:48.148
[breathing heavily]

43:05.415 --> 43:07.084
[continues breathing heavily]
