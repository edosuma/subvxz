That's the guy who
wanted what Wendy stole!

00:03.521 --> 00:05.754
That's the guy who killed her!
That's him on the tv!

00:05.822 --> 00:07.089
<i>Previously on "Scandal"...</i>

00:07.157 --> 00:08.991
- Is it a date? Who is he?
- You wouldn't know him.

00:09.059 --> 00:11.026
I don't even know
if <i>I</i> know him.

00:11.094 --> 00:12.761
You <i>were</i> involved!
I know you were involved!

00:13.529 --> 00:14.629
What the hell do you
want me to tell you?!

00:14.697 --> 00:16.131
Tell me you stole
the White House.

00:16.198 --> 00:18.533
I stole the White House!

00:18.601 --> 00:20.435
- So it's done?
- It's done.

00:20.503 --> 00:22.337
And the police believe
it's a suicide?

00:22.405 --> 00:24.572
And now everyone thinks
that Osborne is the mole.

00:26.275 --> 00:28.276
<i>(Camera shutters clicking)</i>
<i>Today I can confirm</i>

00:28.344 --> 00:30.645
<i>that former C.I.A. Director</i>
<i>Grayden Osborne</i>

00:30.713 --> 00:33.715
<i>was responsible for a leak</i>
<i>of confidential information</i>

00:33.783 --> 00:35.717
<i>to our foreign adversaries.</i>

00:35.785 --> 00:37.352
<i>We believe he was a mole</i>

00:37.420 --> 00:39.287
<i>working in the United States</i>
<i>government.</i>

00:41.424 --> 00:43.124
(Fitz) It's unfortunate
for me to say

00:43.192 --> 00:45.126
that a man I appointed,

00:45.194 --> 00:47.195
a man I trusted,

00:47.263 --> 00:51.066
was secretly and actively
working against this country

00:51.133 --> 00:53.468
in hopes of destroying it.

00:55.604 --> 00:59.006
<i>(Static blips)</i>

01:02.177 --> 01:05.212
<i>(Static blips)</i> Our intelligence
community is stronger than ever.

01:05.280 --> 01:06.647
<i>(Static blips)</i>

01:06.715 --> 01:08.482
And our government
continues to do

everything in its power...
(Camera shutter clicks)

01:10.919 --> 01:12.486
<i>(Static blips)</i>
to keep Americans, both abroad

01:12.553 --> 01:14.421
and right here at home, safe.

01:14.489 --> 01:16.223
(Camera shutters clicking)

01:16.291 --> 01:18.125
And we need to do this
how often exactly?

01:18.192 --> 01:20.060
Every third Wednesday
of every month.

01:20.128 --> 01:20.961
Sweep day.
(Static crackles)

01:22.463 --> 01:24.831
(Fitz) I have instructed
F.B.I. Director Foster

01:24.899 --> 01:28.535
to lead an independent
investigation into the matter.

01:28.603 --> 01:31.405
He will liaise with the senate
intelligence committee,

01:31.472 --> 01:34.708
and will have the complete
cooperation of the C.I.A.

01:34.776 --> 01:37.811
We will find anyone...

01:37.879 --> 01:39.012
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

01:39.680 --> 01:41.314
who may have helped Osborne

acts of treason.

01:43.717 --> 01:45.218
<i>(Static blips)</i>

01:45.586 --> 01:48.222
I am taking full responsibility
for what happened.

01:49.289 --> 01:51.257
And the American people
can rest assured

01:51.325 --> 01:53.526
that I will work tirelessly...
<i>(Static blips)</i>

extent of his crime.

01:57.030 --> 01:59.131

administration,

02:02.202 --> 02:04.971
will leave no stone unturned

Mr. Osborne,

as well as anyone he may have
been working with, to justice.

02:20.653 --> 02:22.454
I mean, you are never home.

what happens next?

02:41.407 --> 02:43.175
- You go home.
- What?

02:43.242 --> 02:45.044
The mole is dead. There's no one
looking for the flash drive.

02:45.110 --> 02:46.410
Or for either of you.

02:46.411 --> 02:47.746
You're not in danger anymore.
You're both safe.

02:47.814 --> 02:49.881
You're both free to go

02:49.949 --> 02:51.583
Wow. Well, thank you
for making sure

02:51.651 --> 02:53.719
we have lives to go back to.

02:53.786 --> 02:54.686

- Thanks.

I need a yes or no by noon,
which is an hour away.

03:07.400 --> 03:10.836
Anybody? (Sighs)
Any thoughts at all?

03:10.903 --> 03:13.071
Sir, ma'am, this interview
has been booked.

03:13.139 --> 03:15.675
It is your first one-on-one
network interview

03:15.676 --> 03:18.310
since the birth of your child
and the assassination attempt.

03:18.378 --> 03:20.245
It is a very important
interview.

03:20.246 --> 03:21.180
It's not Oprah.

03:21.948 --> 03:24.049
No, it is not Oprah.
Oprah is more important.

03:24.117 --> 03:25.451
Would you like Oprah?

03:25.518 --> 03:27.786
Would Oprah be better?

03:27.854 --> 03:29.621
Because I can call Oprah.
I'll call her now.

03:29.689 --> 03:34.393
Will that make the two of you
say yes to this interview?

03:34.461 --> 03:37.162
The president is going to need
to announce his re-election bid

03:37.230 --> 03:38.931
in less than six weeks.

03:38.998 --> 03:42.568
This interview is everything.

03:42.635 --> 03:44.670
We'll do it.

03:44.737 --> 03:46.538
(Sighs) Ma'am?

03:52.812 --> 03:54.680
- We'll do it.
- Okay!

03:54.747 --> 03:56.348
I could tread carefully here
and parse my words,

03:56.416 --> 03:57.616
but instead,
let's just be modern.

03:57.684 --> 03:58.984
It's faster.
In this interview,

03:59.052 --> 04:00.986
rose is going to want to see
a happy couple,

04:01.054 --> 04:02.754
a warm couple,
a connected couple,

04:02.822 --> 04:04.756
two people in love.

04:04.824 --> 04:08.227
They don't want you...
They don't want <i>this.</i>

04:08.294 --> 04:10.395
This is "Who's afraid
of Virginia Woolf?"

04:10.463 --> 04:12.331
This is "MacBeth."
They want the fairy tale.

04:12.398 --> 04:13.966
We know what they want.

04:14.033 --> 04:15.834
I-I know you know,
but that's not the same

04:15.902 --> 04:18.070
as being able to deliver.

04:18.137 --> 04:20.038
Can you give good fairy tale?

04:20.106 --> 04:22.508
Cyrus, we've been doing
this circus act for 20 years.

04:22.575 --> 04:25.477
We'll be fine.

04:25.545 --> 04:27.613
(Door opens)

04:27.680 --> 04:32.351
(Sighs) We'll be fine.
We've had enough practice.

04:32.418 --> 04:35.220
We can't all be
you and James, Cyrus.

04:35.288 --> 04:37.456
We can't all have
a perfect marriage.

04:40.693 --> 04:42.027
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

04:42.028 --> 04:42.894
I'd like you to knock!

04:42.895 --> 04:45.030
It's my house.
I shouldn't have to knock

04:45.098 --> 04:47.533
- on my own door to my own house.
- Or you could call first.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.601
It's my house!
And if I knocked or called

04:49.669 --> 04:51.203
or rang the bell
or did anything else

04:51.271 --> 04:53.906
to redundantly announce my own
presence in my own house,

04:53.973 --> 04:55.774
- I'd wake the baby, our baby.
- Oh...

04:55.842 --> 04:58.243
Who I've barely seen
in 22 days.

04:58.311 --> 05:01.046
Instead, I'm living on room
service and pay-per-view

05:01.114 --> 05:02.648
and wearing wrinkled shirts.

05:02.715 --> 05:05.584
I don't want to knock
on my own door, James.

05:05.652 --> 05:07.453
I want to sleep in my own bed.

05:07.520 --> 05:10.389
I want to drink my wine from a
normal-sized <i>bottle!</i>

05:10.456 --> 05:12.524
I want to live with my husband.
I want to come home.

05:12.592 --> 05:15.427
- (Sighs)
- (Sighs) No.

05:15.495 --> 05:17.429
James...
I can't trust you!

05:17.497 --> 05:19.031
I-I can't even look at you
without immediately assuming

05:19.098 --> 05:20.432
that you're lying.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.434
I-I need time.
You've had time.

05:22.502 --> 05:24.303
You've 22 days worth of
time, not to mention

05:24.370 --> 05:26.738
the six months before that when you
were <i>barely</i> speaking to me.

05:26.806 --> 05:29.942
- I was speaking to you.
- In public! For show.

05:30.009 --> 05:32.077
Like we're some
political couple.

05:32.145 --> 05:33.545
What office are we running for?

05:33.613 --> 05:35.814
I told you, I don't believe
in airing our dirty laundry.

05:35.882 --> 05:38.283
My dirty laundry is at
the hotel laundromat.

05:38.351 --> 05:39.885
I want to come home.

05:39.953 --> 05:41.220
- I need time!
- How much?

05:41.287 --> 05:42.588
How much time?

05:45.091 --> 05:46.558
I don't know.

05:48.928 --> 05:50.596

- For this?
- No, not really my thing.

06:01.808 --> 06:03.842
Are those the Albatross files?

06:03.910 --> 06:04.677
I was wondering
if there's anything

06:04.745 --> 06:06.779
you wanted to add to them
before we put them in storage.

06:07.046 --> 06:09.248
(Quinn) Ma'am. Ma'am.
Ma'am. Please.

06:09.315 --> 06:10.516
You're not allowed back here
without an appointment, ma'am.

06:10.583 --> 06:11.283
I just want to talk to her!

06:11.284 --> 06:13.852
- Can I help you?
- Are you Olivia Pope?

06:14.220 --> 06:15.954
I am. And you are?

06:16.022 --> 06:18.089
Susan Osborne.
You probably know me as...

06:18.157 --> 06:19.391
Grayden Osborne's wife.

06:19.458 --> 06:21.359
Which means we can skip
the part about

06:21.427 --> 06:22.894
what they're saying
my husband did

06:22.962 --> 06:24.195
and talk instead about the fact

06:24.263 --> 06:26.030
that everything
they're saying is a lie!

06:26.098 --> 06:27.365
Mrs. Osborne, you've been
through an awful lot

06:27.433 --> 06:28.900
in the last few days.

06:28.967 --> 06:30.101
No... I know this must be
devastating for you...

06:30.169 --> 06:31.569
- Don't. Please don't...
- For your family...

06:31.637 --> 06:32.970
Don't tell me how I'm feeling

06:33.038 --> 06:35.339
or how I'm grieving
or delusional.

06:35.407 --> 06:38.443
Grayden didn't kill himself.
He was murdered.

06:38.510 --> 06:40.578
- Mrs. Osborne...
- He called me "Susan."

06:40.946 --> 06:43.814
- I'm sorry? - In his suicide
note, he called me Susan.

06:43.982 --> 06:45.750
He never called me Susan.

06:45.817 --> 06:47.918
It was always "Susie"
or "honey."

06:47.986 --> 06:50.921
In 30 years of marriage,
he never called me Susan.

06:50.989 --> 06:52.756
He was distraught.
Maybe he was being formal. (Scoffs)

06:52.824 --> 06:56.894
Someone... forced him
to write that note!

06:56.962 --> 06:59.897
Because someone killed
my husband.

07:07.816 --> 07:08.849
- What if we were wrong?
- We were not wrong.

07:08.917 --> 07:10.217
- What if we were?
- We were not wrong.

07:10.285 --> 07:11.652
Which is why Liv's probably
telling that woman

07:11.720 --> 07:13.254
- we're not taking her case.
- Exactly.

07:13.321 --> 07:14.688
- So why is she...
- Doesn't matter.

07:14.756 --> 07:18.358
Osborne's guilty.
She's not taking the case.

07:19.360 --> 07:20.660
We're taking the case.

07:20.728 --> 07:23.663
(Door closes)

07:23.731 --> 07:27.133
(Laughs)
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

07:27.201 --> 07:29.936
Every loose end that we thought
we tied up, we untie.

07:30.004 --> 07:32.439
Every person of interest we
already talked to, we revisit.

07:32.507 --> 07:33.907
We don't stop
until we're 100% sure

07:33.975 --> 07:35.709
that Grayden Osborne
killed himself

07:35.776 --> 07:37.511
- because he betrayed this country.
- I know it's tough to say no

07:37.578 --> 07:39.079
face-to-face to a
grieving widow, but...

07:39.147 --> 07:41.214
A man is dead.
We can't be wrong.

07:41.282 --> 07:44.284
- Powder burns inside the wound?
- Yep. Consistent with the weapon.

07:44.352 --> 07:46.920
- Blood and tissue on the weapon?
- Yeah, but consistent with the subject.

07:46.988 --> 07:49.723
(Clattering)
What about the, uh... uh...

07:49.790 --> 07:51.791
- (Whispers) Residue.
- Residue.

07:51.859 --> 07:54.027
- Red residue. Which finger?
- On the one that pulled the trigger.

07:54.095 --> 07:56.329
Look, Nancy drew,
this is a classic suicide.

07:56.397 --> 07:57.531
Textbook.

07:57.598 --> 08:01.535
Well, what's wrong
with this picture?

08:02.502 --> 08:05.071
There's nothing out of place.
Osborne's suicide was perfect.

08:05.138 --> 08:06.839
'Cause he killed himself.
'Cause he knew he was caught.

08:06.907 --> 08:08.941
- Because he was the mole.
- Maybe it was too perfect.

08:09.009 --> 08:10.376
Every box checked,
every "I" dotted...

08:10.444 --> 08:12.078
Maybe that's what's wrong
with this picture.

08:12.145 --> 08:13.779
- Murder staged as a suicide.
- Albatross has done it before.

08:13.847 --> 08:15.414
They pinned Wendy's
murder on David.

08:15.482 --> 08:16.916
We need more.
Who else can we talk to?

08:16.983 --> 08:18.617
The man was the director
of the C.I.A.

08:18.685 --> 08:20.552
His job was his life. It's not
like he had drinking buddies.

08:20.620 --> 08:21.987
Wife said he worked 24/7.

08:22.055 --> 08:23.889
Then we talk to the person
that was with him 24/7.

08:23.956 --> 08:25.490
You were
Grayden's security detail.

08:25.558 --> 08:27.025
You protected him,
drove him everywhere,

08:27.093 --> 08:28.894
- spent more time with him than anyone.
- Yes, ma'am.

08:28.961 --> 08:29.928
Do you think he was murdered?

08:29.996 --> 08:31.363
It's not for me to say.

08:31.431 --> 08:33.030
Do you believe he was
selling secrets?

08:33.099 --> 08:34.732
It's not for me to say, ma'am.

08:34.801 --> 08:36.368
Was my husband a patriot
or a traitor?

08:36.436 --> 08:38.936
Can you answer that, Rick?

08:39.304 --> 08:40.337
It's not for me...

08:40.405 --> 08:41.373
To say?

08:41.441 --> 08:43.207
He's dead.

08:43.676 --> 08:45.843
Grayden Osborne,
your boss, her husband,

08:45.911 --> 08:48.713
the father of her child,
a child you know, is dead.

08:48.780 --> 08:50.181
And regardless
of how that happened,

08:50.248 --> 08:51.849
it happened on your watch.

08:51.917 --> 08:53.718
So the least you can do
is stop toeing

08:53.785 --> 08:54.985
the official line of the C.I.A.

08:55.053 --> 08:56.854
Don't leave her wondering
if her husband

08:56.922 --> 08:58.355
was a patriot or a traitor.

08:58.423 --> 09:00.491
Don't leave her daughter
wondering. Help them.

09:00.559 --> 09:02.560
If he was a good man,
honor him.

09:04.830 --> 09:07.531
He was a patriot, ma'am,
through and through.

09:07.599 --> 09:10.267
- But...
- What?

09:11.235 --> 09:12.969
He had a bit
of a gambling problem.

09:13.037 --> 09:15.372
He liked to bet the ponies.

09:15.639 --> 09:17.073
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)
(Olivia) - Dry cleaner was his bookie.

09:17.141 --> 09:18.641
Betting the ponies doesn't mean
he wasn't selling intel.

09:18.709 --> 09:20.643
Betting the ponies means
he could have been in debt.

09:20.711 --> 09:21.446
It does speak to motive.

09:21.512 --> 09:23.212
He was selling government
secrets to the highest bidder.

09:23.213 --> 09:24.214
We circle back to Molly.

09:24.281 --> 09:25.482
Maybe she remembers
something Osborne said

09:25.549 --> 09:26.916
when he was threatening Wendy,

09:26.984 --> 09:28.418
something definitive
we can go on.

09:28.486 --> 09:30.854
- It all began with Molly.
Maybe it ends there, too. - Hmm.

09:30.921 --> 09:32.122
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

09:32.489 --> 09:34.057
What is it, Cyrus?

09:35.124 --> 09:36.491
Just wanted to go over
your talking points

09:36.559 --> 09:37.359
for the interview,

09:37.427 --> 09:40.429
see if you're comfortable
with everything we discussed.

09:40.496 --> 09:43.732
Am I comfortable?
(Sighs)

09:43.800 --> 09:45.901
(Paper rustling)

09:45.968 --> 09:47.569
You still camped out
at The Masland?

09:47.637 --> 09:50.005
- Sir?
- The hotel, Cy?

09:50.373 --> 09:51.940
Has your husband let you
come back home yet?

09:52.007 --> 09:53.875
I wasn't aware that you...

09:53.943 --> 09:57.012
I'm the president.
I know all kinds of things.

09:57.079 --> 09:58.613
I'm fine, sir.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.181
You certainly don't have
to concern yourself

10:00.249 --> 10:01.983
with my love life.
(Forced chuckle)

10:02.051 --> 10:03.485
But you do love him.

10:03.552 --> 10:05.620
Of course.

10:08.224 --> 10:10.425
Don't give up on him.

10:10.493 --> 10:12.994
If you love him.

10:13.062 --> 10:14.329
Just...

10:16.732 --> 10:18.533
Don't give up.

10:23.438 --> 10:25.306
(Paper rustling)

10:26.474 --> 10:28.008
(Sighs)

10:28.075 --> 10:29.909
Molly wasn't answering her
phone, so I went by her place.

10:29.977 --> 10:32.645
- Was she there? - No.
It was cleaned out. She's gone.

10:32.713 --> 10:35.148
- Huck.
- On it.

10:35.216 --> 10:37.117
(Typing)
I'm in her bank account.

10:37.184 --> 10:38.618
(Harrison) Looks like
miss Molly just got paid.

10:38.686 --> 10:40.620
$100,000 deposited
yesterday afternoon.

10:40.688 --> 10:41.823
(Huck) She was a plant.
Somebody owned her.

10:41.889 --> 10:43.089
She played us.
She lied.

10:43.090 --> 10:44.591
The mole must have hired
Molly and paid her

10:44.659 --> 10:46.226
to tell us it was Osborne.

10:46.294 --> 10:47.694
So Osborne didn't kill
Wendy to get the flash drive.

10:47.762 --> 10:48.729
Which means he was not the mole,

10:48.797 --> 10:50.330
which means the real mole is
still out there, which means...

10:50.398 --> 10:53.100
David's still in danger.
(Panting)

10:53.168 --> 10:56.703
(Pounding on door)

10:57.871 --> 11:00.006
David, oh, good.
Thank God you're here.

11:00.073 --> 11:02.008
Get your things.
Pack a bag.

11:02.076 --> 11:04.010
You're coming back
to the office right now.

11:04.078 --> 11:05.411
I just got home, and now
you want me to come back?

11:05.479 --> 11:06.979
We were wrong.
Osborne isn't the mole.

11:07.047 --> 11:09.982
Which means you're not safe,
which means... (Sighs)

11:10.050 --> 11:12.251
Let's go!

11:12.319 --> 11:13.419
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

11:13.487 --> 11:15.488
(Phone chimes)

11:15.556 --> 11:17.657
(Olivia)
Osborne wasn't the mole.

11:18.324 --> 11:19.958
Uh, say that again.

11:20.026 --> 11:22.294
- Osborne wasn't the mole.
- No.

11:22.362 --> 11:24.329
Osborne was the mole,
because the president

11:24.397 --> 11:26.364
went on national TV and said so.

11:26.432 --> 11:28.200
I'm alerting you to a
national security problem,

11:28.267 --> 11:29.568
and you're worried
about the optics?

11:29.635 --> 11:32.237
You as much as anyone know
that optics are everything.

11:32.305 --> 11:34.706
Cyrus, he wasn't
your security breach.

11:34.774 --> 11:37.075
All right.

11:37.143 --> 11:38.343
I'm listening.

11:38.411 --> 11:39.711
Who's your source?

11:39.779 --> 11:41.179
- Osborne's wife.
- Oh!

11:41.247 --> 11:42.547
- Cyrus...
- Come on.

11:42.615 --> 11:44.015
His grieving widow

11:44.783 --> 11:46.651
doesn't think he was a traitor?

11:46.718 --> 11:48.319
Why didn't you say?

11:48.387 --> 11:49.887
That makes all the difference.
Have you talked to his kids?

11:49.955 --> 11:51.222
I'm dying to know
what they think.

11:51.290 --> 11:53.257
There are irregularities
in the case.

11:53.325 --> 11:54.926
There are irregularities
in life...

11:54.993 --> 11:58.396
Why you and I spend so much time
and expend so much energy

11:58.663 --> 12:00.398
- fixing them.
- What is going on with you?

12:00.465 --> 12:02.099
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I'm trying to help you.

12:02.367 --> 12:04.068
- You sure about that?
- What do <i>you</i> mean?

12:04.135 --> 12:05.869
(Chuckles) I mean, are you
sure you're not subconsciously

12:05.937 --> 12:07.304
trying to sabotage
this White House?

12:07.372 --> 12:10.374
Okay, that is ridiculous
and petty and insulting.

12:11.042 --> 12:14.578
Liv... (Sighs) I want to
take this seriously, I do,

12:14.645 --> 12:16.513
but I've just gotten my
hand back on the tiller,

12:16.581 --> 12:19.216
so I cannot let you
rock this boat.

12:19.283 --> 12:22.219
- Osborne was a traitor.
- You know I can't let this go.

12:22.286 --> 12:25.689
I have to. 'Night, liv.
(Line disconnects)

12:27.491 --> 12:28.658
(Phone clatters)

12:30.428 --> 12:32.062
(Exhales deeply)

12:38.402 --> 12:42.272
Olivia Pope knows
Osborne wasn't the mole.

12:42.540 --> 12:45.442
Which means she won't rest
until she discovers who is.

12:45.509 --> 12:47.677
I know.

12:47.745 --> 12:50.346
I trust...

12:50.414 --> 12:52.082
You'll take care of this.

12:54.000 --> 13:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:10.974 --> 13:12.375
You were right.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.010
You mean...

13:14.078 --> 13:15.712
Your husband didn't
commit treason.

13:15.779 --> 13:17.013
- He didn't betray his country.
- (Sighs)

13:17.081 --> 13:18.548
And he didn't kill himself?

13:18.615 --> 13:21.451
- He didn't kill himself.
- Oh... (Exhales)

13:21.518 --> 13:23.419
So now what?

13:23.487 --> 13:25.021
You go home,

13:25.088 --> 13:26.522
you grieve for your husband,

13:26.590 --> 13:28.591
you tell your daughter
her father died

13:28.659 --> 13:30.059
an honorable man,

13:30.127 --> 13:31.627
and you let me work
on clearing his name,

13:31.695 --> 13:32.995
which I will do.

13:33.063 --> 13:34.430
I promise you.

13:35.298 --> 13:37.799
- Grayden loved this country,
miss Pope. - I know.

13:37.867 --> 13:39.434
The White House doesn't care?

13:39.502 --> 13:40.702
They think we're lying to
help our client. (Scoffs)

13:40.770 --> 13:41.703
If we want them
to take us seriously,

13:41.771 --> 13:42.904
we need to give them proof.

13:42.972 --> 13:44.306
Huck, I need you
to follow the money.

13:44.374 --> 13:45.507
Trace it back to its source.
See where it leads.

13:45.575 --> 13:47.509
I need the rest of you
to look for Molly.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.077
She's our link
to the real mole.

13:49.145 --> 13:50.612
If I were Molly, if I
played us and got a payday,

13:50.680 --> 13:52.414
I'd be heading
to an airport right now.

13:52.482 --> 13:54.416
- Harrison... - I'll work my
contacts at justice,

13:54.484 --> 13:55.884
see if I can get
some flight manifests.

13:55.952 --> 13:57.686
Or... I work my contacts
at homeland security

13:57.754 --> 13:59.821
and we put this girl
on a no-fly list.

13:59.889 --> 14:01.089
They'll stop her
from buying a ticket,

14:01.157 --> 14:03.825
put her in a room
till we get there.

14:03.893 --> 14:05.427
- Gladiators in helmets, right?
- Suits.

14:05.495 --> 14:06.795
Do it.

14:06.863 --> 14:08.897
How do we find Albatross
if all we know

14:08.965 --> 14:10.799
is a deposit was made
from some mystery bank

14:10.867 --> 14:14.269
- into Molly's account?
- Reverse promontory point.

14:15.937 --> 14:17.471
You digitally trace back
the transaction

14:17.539 --> 14:19.106
until you find where the code
from the receiver's

14:19.173 --> 14:20.107
A.B.A. number overlaps
with the code

14:20.175 --> 14:21.342
from the depositor's
A.B.A. number.

14:21.410 --> 14:22.944
Right... here.

14:23.011 --> 14:24.912
Then we send a little worm
along that nexus

14:24.979 --> 14:26.080
until we have...
(Beeping)

14:26.147 --> 14:27.681
- The mole's account.
- Yep.

14:27.749 --> 14:29.450
"Bud Johnson"? Really?
(Typing)

14:29.517 --> 14:31.051
He couldn't do better than
"Bud Johnson" for a fake name?

14:31.119 --> 14:33.387
Well, here's one thing
that's real.

14:33.455 --> 14:35.489
Albatross rented a storage unit
in Ashburn three hours ago.

14:35.557 --> 14:36.824
We're gonna go check it out.

14:36.891 --> 14:38.225
Maybe that's why there's
no sign of Molly.

14:38.293 --> 14:40.127
Maybe he killed her and
stuck her body in there.

14:40.195 --> 14:41.529
You don't bring a body
to a storage unit.

14:41.595 --> 14:41.795
Too many witnesses.

14:41.796 --> 14:43.430
Also, the smell.
You're much better off

14:43.498 --> 14:45.398
finding a dumpster
on trash day.

14:48.135 --> 14:48.703
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

14:48.704 --> 14:50.269
I'm hungry. Starving.

14:50.270 --> 14:51.604
That is why we are
having dinner tonight.

14:51.672 --> 14:52.972
Did I mention that I cook?

14:53.040 --> 14:54.841
- You did not.
- Well, I do.

14:54.908 --> 14:56.009
And not just pasta.

14:56.077 --> 14:58.578
Any guy can boil a pot of noodles.
I actually cook. (Door closes)

14:58.645 --> 15:00.246
So I'm gonna come over
and make you a meal

15:00.314 --> 15:02.482
in that beautiful kitchen
that you never use.

15:02.549 --> 15:05.618
- How did you know?
- (Sighs) Know what?

15:05.686 --> 15:08.186
That I never use my kitchen.

15:09.556 --> 15:11.424
Just a hunch.
(Laughs)

15:11.892 --> 15:14.493
Well, I would love for you
to break it in for me,

15:14.561 --> 15:16.262
but I can't.

15:16.329 --> 15:18.297
- Let me guess. Work.
-Work.

15:18.365 --> 15:20.566
- Oh, you're killing me here.
- I'm sorry.

15:20.634 --> 15:22.501
I am going to take you up
on the offer,

15:23.069 --> 15:24.436
just not tonight.

15:24.504 --> 15:25.804
Well, I'm gonna hold you to that.

15:25.872 --> 15:27.506
Please do.

15:27.573 --> 15:29.307
(Chuckles)

15:32.078 --> 15:33.645
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

15:33.713 --> 15:35.013
Date night sounds more like an order.
(Mellie laughs)

15:35.081 --> 15:36.314
"You will have fun
on wednesdays

15:36.382 --> 15:37.716
between 7:00 and 9:00."

15:37.784 --> 15:39.184
And who wants to be told
when to have fun?

15:39.252 --> 15:40.519
But if it's the only way
I can carve out time

15:40.586 --> 15:42.254
on my schedule for us
to be together...

15:43.121 --> 15:44.288
Date night it is.

15:44.356 --> 15:45.556
It gives us something
to look forward to.

15:45.624 --> 15:46.958
Mm-hmm.

15:47.025 --> 15:49.360
It must be so hard
living in a bubble,

15:49.428 --> 15:51.529
the weight of the world
on your shoulders.

15:51.597 --> 15:54.332
<i>- We're a long way from Frank's tavern.</i>
<i>- Ahh. (Chuckles)</i>

15:54.399 --> 15:56.234
- <i>It wasn't hard to focus there.</i>
- <i>Mnh-mnh.</i>

15:56.301 --> 15:57.768
<i>(Giggles)</i>

15:58.236 --> 16:00.204
<i>Frank's.</i>
<i>That's where you met, right?</i>

16:00.272 --> 16:01.672
Yeah, I was fresh out of the Navy.

16:01.740 --> 16:03.274
Mellie was on a date...
(Sighs)

16:03.341 --> 16:05.175
With Jim...
What was it?

16:05.843 --> 16:08.278
Let's spare Jim the press attention.
(Laughs)

16:08.346 --> 16:10.180
Anyway, I was at the bar

16:10.248 --> 16:12.716
goofing around with some
buddies when I first saw her

16:12.783 --> 16:17.754
lighting up a booth
by the window, and...

16:17.822 --> 16:20.023
It was just one
of those rare moments,

16:20.091 --> 16:22.859
a crossroads where you know...

16:22.927 --> 16:24.494
You just know,
if you don't act now,

16:24.562 --> 16:25.996
if you let this moment
slip away,

16:26.063 --> 16:28.365
it will haunt you for
the rest of your life.

16:29.332 --> 16:31.133
<i>(Mellie) He didn't realize</i>
<i>we were gonna be classmates</i>

16:31.201 --> 16:32.435
<i>for the next three years.</i>

16:32.503 --> 16:34.203
(Laughs) And also I didn't
want to step on Jim's date.

16:34.271 --> 16:36.205
- Against some code you men have?
- Exactly.

16:36.273 --> 16:38.274
So I did the proper thing.

16:38.342 --> 16:40.944
I waited until Jim went to the bar
for another round... (Laughs)

16:41.011 --> 16:42.211
Then I swept in.
(Giggles)

16:42.279 --> 16:44.213
But then...

16:44.281 --> 16:45.715
He just stood there.
(Chuckles)

16:45.783 --> 16:47.150
Tongue-tied?

16:47.218 --> 16:50.220
This girl was just clearly
out of my league.

16:50.287 --> 16:51.788
Somehow I got her name and number.

16:52.656 --> 16:54.323
Of course he didn't have
a pen or paper.

16:54.391 --> 16:57.393
I had to write it on a
coaster with eyeliner.

16:57.460 --> 16:59.128
<i>Sounds like nothing was</i>
<i>going to get in the way</i>

16:59.195 --> 17:00.562
<i>of fate that night.</i>

17:00.630 --> 17:03.032
<i>One way or another...</i>

17:03.099 --> 17:04.967
<i>I think we would have</i>
<i>found each other.</i>

17:06.469 --> 17:07.670
Ugh.

17:09.172 --> 17:10.372
(Turns off TV)

17:12.976 --> 17:15.243
(Sighs)

17:19.915 --> 17:22.516
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

17:24.453 --> 17:25.453
This is it.

17:26.555 --> 17:28.189
(Exhales)

17:28.256 --> 17:29.690
- You find which storage
unit he rents? - Yep.

17:29.758 --> 17:31.425
(Seat belts clicking)

17:31.493 --> 17:33.060
No, stay in the car.
Keep watch.

17:33.128 --> 17:35.596
If anyone suspicious starts
to go in, text me. (Sighs)

17:38.734 --> 17:40.034
(Seat belt clatters)

17:45.774 --> 17:47.441
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

17:47.509 --> 17:48.342
(Lock clicks)

18:12.534 --> 18:13.801
(Creaking)

18:15.469 --> 18:17.969
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

18:18.171 --> 18:19.906
(Thuds) (Gasps)

18:23.043 --> 18:25.845
(Doorbell rings)

18:27.114 --> 18:28.915
(Clattering)

18:31.452 --> 18:32.485
(Remote control clicks)

18:32.553 --> 18:34.020
(Clatters)

18:44.798 --> 18:47.333
I come bearing Gettysburger.

18:47.401 --> 18:49.302
Sorry I bailed on dinner.

18:49.369 --> 18:50.870
For the record,
I was gonna make you

18:50.938 --> 18:52.905
something a little classier
than cheeseburger and fries.

18:52.973 --> 18:55.508
Duly noted.
I like your place.

18:55.576 --> 18:58.177
We're gonna need
plates and napkins.

18:58.245 --> 18:59.745
Many napkins.

18:59.813 --> 19:02.448
And I hope you have
better wine than this.

19:02.516 --> 19:05.485
For the Gettysburger?
For the Gettysburger.

19:05.552 --> 19:07.687
(Sighs)

19:07.754 --> 19:09.388
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

19:18.251 --> 19:20.319
(Playing indistinctly)

19:20.386 --> 19:21.720
(Bell dings)
Fill out the forms.

19:21.788 --> 19:23.355
Deposit... first and last
month's rent due.

19:23.423 --> 19:24.656
I'm actually looking
for a friend.

19:24.724 --> 19:26.058
Yeah, welcome to my world.

19:26.125 --> 19:27.793
No, I mean a friend of mine
came in a while ago

19:27.860 --> 19:29.528
- and hasn't come out.
- Unit number?

19:29.595 --> 19:31.363
I don't have one.
I don't even know...

19:31.431 --> 19:33.498
(Sighs) Hey, would you just
mind if I looked around?

19:33.566 --> 19:35.300
(Sighs)

19:35.368 --> 19:38.036
Ten floors.
Elevator's that way.

19:38.104 --> 19:40.005
Good luck.
And don't get lost.

19:42.442 --> 19:43.975
(Door closes)

19:48.481 --> 19:49.815
(Exhales)

19:53.752 --> 19:55.219
I don't drink beer.

19:55.287 --> 19:56.487
- Tonight you do.
- Hmm.

19:56.555 --> 19:57.822
It's a light ale.

19:57.890 --> 20:00.124
Of course, a dark ale
would also do the trick.

20:00.191 --> 20:02.192
Really, any beer pairs
well with a burger.

20:02.260 --> 20:04.728
- It's what regular people drink.
- I'm regular people.

20:04.796 --> 20:06.630
No, no. (Chuckles)
You're special...

20:06.698 --> 20:09.133
and fancy, so...
(Laughing)

20:09.200 --> 20:10.934
for one night,
come down to my level.

20:11.002 --> 20:12.503
Have a beer with me, Liv.
(Continues laughing)

20:19.143 --> 20:19.976
(Clink)

20:22.045 --> 20:23.112
Ahh.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.180
(Shudders softly)

20:24.248 --> 20:26.215
(Both laugh)

20:26.283 --> 20:28.584
Let me guess. Your phone.
I should check my messages.

20:28.652 --> 20:30.319
- No.
- No?

20:30.387 --> 20:32.288
No. Because if you
check your messages,

20:32.356 --> 20:34.190
then you'll decide that you
have to go back to work,

20:34.258 --> 20:36.158
and that means
that you'll leave,

20:36.226 --> 20:38.094
and I wouldn't have
the chance to do this.

20:40.230 --> 20:42.164
And this.

20:47.638 --> 20:48.905
Or this.

20:52.309 --> 20:55.378
(Sighs softly)

20:55.445 --> 20:57.513
What is it?

20:57.581 --> 20:59.081
Hmm?

20:59.949 --> 21:01.283
Back to work?

21:03.319 --> 21:06.555
What's your excuse this
time, Olivia Pope?

21:08.524 --> 21:10.192
Nothing.

21:12.528 --> 21:14.229
I got nothing.

21:30.146 --> 21:32.347
(Moans and laughs)

21:37.085 --> 21:38.585
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

21:38.653 --> 21:40.420
(Panting)
Of course I called him.

21:40.488 --> 21:42.755
- He didn't answer?
- He said he'd be gone a minute,

21:42.823 --> 21:43.890
and it's been a couple hours.

21:43.958 --> 21:45.792
In this place, it would take
an actual search party

21:45.860 --> 21:47.794
two days just to get
to every floor.

21:47.862 --> 21:48.796
What if something happened?

21:48.863 --> 21:49.863
Things don't happen to Huck.
He's Huck.

21:49.864 --> 21:51.098
He's probably waiting
for you back at the car.

21:51.099 --> 21:52.165
And what if he's not?

21:52.366 --> 21:53.800
Molly's being detained at Dulles.

21:53.868 --> 21:55.335
My friend at homeland says
she was trying to board

21:55.402 --> 21:56.603
a flight to Belize.

21:56.670 --> 21:58.004
- Harrison?
- Hang on.

21:58.072 --> 21:59.439
But they can only reasonably
keep her for an hour.

21:59.507 --> 22:01.241
I called Liv. She's not
answering, but we need to move.

22:01.308 --> 22:02.775
Quinn, I'm sure it's nothing,
but if it's something,

22:02.843 --> 22:04.210
you're gonna have to
handle it on your own.

22:04.278 --> 22:05.245
So handle it.
(Keys jangle)

22:05.312 --> 22:07.313
Nice work, Rosen.

22:07.681 --> 22:09.182
(Bell dings) No luck.

22:09.249 --> 22:11.017
<i>(Cartoon playing indistinctly)</i>
- (Sighs) You try calling?

22:11.084 --> 22:12.985
- Repeatedly.
- Well, maybe his phone's off.

22:13.053 --> 22:14.887
Do you mind if I take
a look at the security feeds?

22:14.955 --> 22:16.055
No.
No can do.

22:16.423 --> 22:18.224
You don't understand.
His phone is never off.

22:18.291 --> 22:19.658
Maybe his battery is dead.

22:19.726 --> 22:21.026
My friend is inside
this building,

22:21.094 --> 22:22.962
and he's in trouble,
and his battery never dies.

22:23.029 --> 22:25.131
And on the off chance it does,
he's got two extras

22:25.198 --> 22:27.833
- and a spare phone.
- Well, la-di-da, fancy friend.

22:28.034 --> 22:30.435
Something's wrong. You need to
let me see those camera feeds.

22:30.503 --> 22:32.037
Darling, I don't need
to do anything.

22:33.973 --> 22:35.540
Listen, Zeke.

22:35.608 --> 22:37.275
"Darling" has a law degree
from Stanford

22:37.343 --> 22:38.777
and the chief of police
on speed dial.

22:38.844 --> 22:40.745
I sat outside here for an hour

22:40.813 --> 22:42.781
and watched three ladies
enter with three gentlemen,

22:42.848 --> 22:44.683
each of whom departed
with a spring in his step

22:44.750 --> 22:46.351
and probably 200 bucks poorer.

22:46.419 --> 22:48.620
(Sighs) So I suggest you
go ahead and let "darling"

22:48.688 --> 22:50.755
take a look at the damn security cams.

22:50.823 --> 22:52.390
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

22:52.458 --> 22:56.261
(Sighs) (Static crackling)

22:57.229 --> 22:58.362
You rocked her.
She was asleep.

22:58.430 --> 23:00.598
You <i>rocked her.</i>

23:00.665 --> 23:02.533
- To sleep! - I spent the last
three weeks breaking her

23:02.601 --> 23:05.302
from her sleep crutches,
the worst of which is rocking.

23:05.370 --> 23:07.137
Did you not read
any of the sleep books?

23:07.205 --> 23:08.473
You set us back weeks.

23:08.640 --> 23:11.042
- (Sighs) W-well, what do you
think you're doing? - Reading.

23:11.909 --> 23:13.710
- (Scoffs) You're not going back
to the hotel? - No, I checked out.

23:13.778 --> 23:15.212
You checked out of the hotel?

23:15.280 --> 23:17.047
After 23 days, they
consider you a resident.

23:17.115 --> 23:19.316
Every maid knew my name.
It was humiliating.

23:19.384 --> 23:20.951
- Well, you're not staying here.
- Watch me.

23:21.019 --> 23:23.520
- Cyrus! - I think it's time
we talk to someone.

23:23.588 --> 23:25.122
- Wh-what does that mean?
- Get some help.

23:25.189 --> 23:27.024
- Well, you mean couples therapy?
- Yes.

23:27.091 --> 23:28.625
- You cannot be serious.
- Why?

23:28.693 --> 23:30.127
Because I've been asking you
to go to therapy with me

23:30.194 --> 23:32.029
since we moved in together,
and you refused.

23:32.096 --> 23:33.997
And the only reason
you're even suggesting it now

23:34.065 --> 23:36.433
is because you know
we could never go!

23:37.301 --> 23:38.368
Why can't we go?

23:38.735 --> 23:40.469
Because couples therapy

23:40.537 --> 23:42.738
is for people who have
normal marriages

23:42.806 --> 23:45.141
and normal problems,
and we don't have either.

23:45.208 --> 23:47.610
What do you want me to say when
they ask me what our issues are?

23:47.677 --> 23:48.878
That... that it really gets
under my skin

23:48.945 --> 23:51.047
when he does things like...
like steal the covers,

23:51.114 --> 23:52.748
and he leaves dirty dishes
in the sink,

23:52.816 --> 23:54.750
and he rigs national elections!

23:55.418 --> 23:57.653
Therapy requires
telling the truth,

23:57.720 --> 23:59.454
and you don't tell
the truth, Cy.

23:59.522 --> 24:02.591
- You lie for a living. You are a liar.
- I told you the truth.

24:02.659 --> 24:04.260
Yeah, you made me beg you
and fight with you...

24:04.328 --> 24:06.495
I told you the truth. I told you,
and now I'm paying for it.

24:06.562 --> 24:08.697
You want the truth from me?
You make it worth my time.

24:08.765 --> 24:11.899
- Make it worth your time?
- You love me anyway.

24:11.967 --> 24:13.401
You don't use it against me.

24:13.469 --> 24:15.303
You don't keep a list
of my crimes.

24:15.371 --> 24:17.605
You wanted to know who I am?
This is who I am.

24:17.673 --> 24:19.407
Defiance is who I am.
This is me.

24:19.475 --> 24:22.610
This is who you married.
This is who you love.

24:24.446 --> 24:26.314
I got on the stand
in front of that grand jury

24:26.382 --> 24:27.682
and I perjured myself.

24:27.750 --> 24:29.517
You made me perjure myself!

24:29.585 --> 24:31.086
- I never made you perjure...
- You made me.

24:31.153 --> 24:32.153
You told me the truth

24:32.154 --> 24:34.055
and you gave me a baby
and you bought my soul,

24:34.123 --> 24:36.291
- and I didn't have a choice!
- You had a choice!

24:36.358 --> 24:38.593
I didn't! What was I
supposed to choose?

24:38.661 --> 24:41.162
- What choice did I have?!
- You had a choice, James!

24:41.230 --> 24:42.730
You could have put me in prison.

24:42.798 --> 24:44.198
You could have brought down
the White House.

24:44.266 --> 24:45.767
You could have chosen justice.
You chose love.

24:45.834 --> 24:48.403
You chose me.
You chose our life.

24:48.470 --> 24:51.305
You chose yourself.
You chose your own happiness.

24:51.373 --> 24:54.509
And that's not sitting so well

24:54.576 --> 24:56.010
with you now.

24:56.078 --> 24:57.345
(Exhales)

24:57.413 --> 24:59.147
Now.

24:59.214 --> 25:02.216
(Breathing heavily)

25:02.584 --> 25:04.752
It's just inside,

25:05.120 --> 25:08.488
rotting deep inside you,
this choice you made,

25:08.556 --> 25:10.757
and it's not so much
the choice.

25:10.825 --> 25:14.728
It's the fact that you
now know you're capable

25:14.796 --> 25:16.863
of making that kind of choice.

25:18.866 --> 25:21.101
That's what's keeping you
awake at night.

25:21.169 --> 25:22.936
And you can pretend it's me,

25:23.004 --> 25:25.172
that I've... (Exhales)

25:25.239 --> 25:28.275
infected you with...

25:28.342 --> 25:31.511
all my bad, bad ways.

25:31.579 --> 25:34.214
But it wasn't.

25:34.482 --> 25:36.583
You made a choice.

25:36.850 --> 25:39.886
You did this.
This is the man you are.

25:41.956 --> 25:43.790
And guess what?
I love...

25:43.857 --> 25:47.694
you... anyway.

25:47.761 --> 25:49.562
Because that is the man I am.

25:57.171 --> 25:59.105
I wish you didn't tell me...

25:59.173 --> 26:01.307
When I asked about Defiance.

26:01.375 --> 26:03.876
I wish you'd just lied to me.

26:03.944 --> 26:06.012
I wish you'd let me
believe that...

26:08.482 --> 26:11.216
I wish you'd lied.

26:21.012 --> 26:22.346
You get five minutes
alone with her,

26:22.413 --> 26:23.680
and then I need to release her.
(Opens door)

26:24.348 --> 26:25.748
We know you got paid, Molly.

26:25.816 --> 26:27.183
So either tell us who paid you

26:27.251 --> 26:28.952
or continue to lie to us
and never set foot

26:29.019 --> 26:30.054
on an airplane again.

26:30.121 --> 26:31.321
Hard to dodge obstruction
of justice charges

26:31.322 --> 26:32.655
when you can't leave
the country.

26:33.123 --> 26:34.924
- I don't believe this.
- We're not the police.

26:34.992 --> 26:36.192
We're not gonna throw you in jail,

26:36.193 --> 26:37.261
we're not gonna take
away your money.

26:37.328 --> 26:38.428
My money?

26:38.629 --> 26:40.997
You think I did this
for the money?

26:41.064 --> 26:44.166
I did this because not doing
this meant ending up dead,

26:44.234 --> 26:46.769
and then waking up in bed
with my throat cut

26:46.837 --> 26:49.839
and my tongue pulled out
so I couldn't scream for help!

26:50.607 --> 26:52.140
That's what this person
said they would do to me

26:52.208 --> 26:54.643
if I didn't do
exactly what they said.

26:54.711 --> 26:58.013
So, yes, I lied to you, but it
wasn't because of the money.

26:58.081 --> 26:59.548
(Crying) In fact,
if this person knew

26:59.616 --> 27:00.849
I was talking to you
right now...

27:02.685 --> 27:04.685
Time's up.
She's free to go.

27:05.688 --> 27:07.022
I-I'm sorry.

27:11.628 --> 27:12.694
(Door closes)

27:16.898 --> 27:18.833
(Gasps) That's him.
What floor is that?

27:18.900 --> 27:21.268
- The third.
- (Sighs)

27:21.336 --> 27:22.870
(Clicks mouse)

27:24.973 --> 27:26.674
He just...

27:26.741 --> 27:27.975
He's gone.

27:28.343 --> 27:30.644
(Sighs) There must be...

27:30.712 --> 27:31.945
Is there somewhere else
he could have gone

27:32.013 --> 27:33.213
that's not on the feed?

27:33.281 --> 27:34.815
A-a stairwell or bathroom
or something?

27:34.883 --> 27:36.483
I just take deposits.

27:37.351 --> 27:39.786
I don't notice the magic of the place.
(Sighs)

27:39.854 --> 27:42.255
<i>...Turn off the distractions</i>
<i>and focus on one another.</i>

27:42.323 --> 27:43.756
It's getting tons of play.

27:43.824 --> 27:46.392
The story of how we met...
people can't get enough of it!

27:46.460 --> 27:48.995
Jim Wyatt...
Was that his name?

27:49.063 --> 27:50.396
Was that whose name?

27:50.464 --> 27:52.332
The guy you were with you
were dating when we met.

27:52.399 --> 27:53.566
What's this about?

27:53.634 --> 27:55.068
The real story.

27:56.837 --> 28:00.473
This is about the real story
of how we met.

28:00.541 --> 28:02.475
Do you remember?

28:02.543 --> 28:04.377
Or have you told the
fake one so many times

28:04.445 --> 28:07.947
that it's drifted away,
replaced by fiction?

28:08.015 --> 28:11.084
- Fitz...
- It goes something like this.

28:11.651 --> 28:14.352
My dad swings through
town on business,

28:14.420 --> 28:16.021
says he wants to take
me out for dinner,

28:16.088 --> 28:17.589
which in retrospect was odd,

28:17.657 --> 28:19.024
because as a senator
from California,

28:19.091 --> 28:20.592
he didn't have any business in Boston.

28:20.660 --> 28:21.893
Or the entire state
of Massachusetts,

28:21.961 --> 28:23.495
for that matter.

28:23.562 --> 28:26.464
So...
we go to Frank's tavern

28:26.532 --> 28:29.801
to meet up with an old
college buddy of his,

28:29.869 --> 28:33.305
who just happened to bring
along one of his clerks...

28:33.672 --> 28:36.040
A bright and charming clerk,
I might add.

28:36.108 --> 28:38.810
My father was always displeased
with who I was dating.

28:39.677 --> 28:41.378
He had this thing
about breeding.

28:41.446 --> 28:43.213
(Laughs)

28:43.281 --> 28:45.115
Breeding... like we were
discussing racehorses

28:45.183 --> 28:47.117
instead of women.

28:47.185 --> 28:49.620
Which was ridiculous,
because his father

28:49.687 --> 28:51.588
worked the docks
his whole life,

28:51.656 --> 28:53.190
but you know what they say.

28:53.258 --> 28:55.159
There's no snob
bigger than new money,

28:55.226 --> 28:57.661
and our money stank of new.

28:57.729 --> 28:59.496
But you...

28:59.564 --> 29:01.632
Your blood was blue.

29:02.199 --> 29:04.834
Mayflower blue,
D.A.R. blue.

29:04.902 --> 29:07.537
Sure, there was some slave
trading in your background.

29:07.605 --> 29:11.041
Your granddaddy ran liquor.
But...

29:11.508 --> 29:13.776
Old money meant something
to Big Jerry.

29:15.679 --> 29:17.113
(Exhales)

29:18.915 --> 29:20.316
And you have breeding.

29:20.383 --> 29:22.117
You're a thoroughbred racehorse.

29:22.185 --> 29:25.287
You can play the majors,
and there you were.

29:25.355 --> 29:28.591
It wasn't even a blind date.
It was a merger.

29:28.658 --> 29:30.826
It was just shy
of prostitution.

29:31.394 --> 29:33.328
They sold you to me.

29:33.396 --> 29:36.231
They made a deal,
and they shook hands.

29:38.534 --> 29:41.403
I often wonder, did you
know what was happening?

29:41.471 --> 29:42.938
Was I the only one naive
enough to think

29:43.005 --> 29:45.841
that you being there
was a coincidence?

29:45.908 --> 29:47.476
It doesn't matter.

29:50.879 --> 29:52.546
Big Jerry got what he paid for.

29:52.614 --> 29:56.550
(Exhales) Scheme worked
like gangbusters.

29:56.618 --> 29:59.520
We did meet at Frank's Tavern.
That much is true.

29:59.588 --> 30:01.722
What's your point?

30:01.790 --> 30:05.125
Does it ever bother you?

30:05.193 --> 30:07.628
The lies, all the pretending?

30:07.696 --> 30:09.196
And that's not an accusation,
'cause I do it, too.

30:09.264 --> 30:11.298
I do it well.

30:11.366 --> 30:14.301
It's just a question.

30:14.369 --> 30:18.973
Because it's just gotten
so easy.

30:19.040 --> 30:21.876
I don't know anymore.

30:24.345 --> 30:26.512
Pretending <i>is</i> what's real.

30:27.781 --> 30:29.182
What?

30:30.249 --> 30:33.552
Every married couple alive
pretends.

30:33.620 --> 30:35.520
They pretend they don't
hate their in-laws

30:35.588 --> 30:37.389
or their husband's stupid jokes

30:37.457 --> 30:39.791
or their wife's real laugh

30:39.859 --> 30:43.595
or that they don't actually
love one of their children

30:43.663 --> 30:45.797
more than the others.

30:45.865 --> 30:48.233
Marriage is... (Sighs)

30:48.301 --> 30:52.270
Well, it's almost
all pretend...

30:52.338 --> 30:54.339
for everyone.

30:56.042 --> 30:59.111
That's the reality.
That's what's real.

31:00.513 --> 31:02.714
Buying into the delusion

31:02.782 --> 31:05.550
that there's any other way
to live together,

31:05.618 --> 31:10.789
to get through
an entire life together...

31:10.857 --> 31:12.224
That's...

31:14.293 --> 31:16.161
(Breathes sharply)

31:16.229 --> 31:19.064
Well, that's the fantasy.

31:20.332 --> 31:21.732
That's pretending.

31:25.370 --> 31:27.137
Did I do this to you?

31:29.908 --> 31:31.942
Or have you always been like this?

31:32.010 --> 31:33.777
Because if it was me...

31:38.550 --> 31:39.850
I'm sorry.

31:42.454 --> 31:44.188
I'm sorry.

31:47.124 --> 31:50.092
Fitz, what's wrong?
What's bothering you?

31:54.731 --> 31:56.532
Nothing.

31:56.600 --> 31:58.367
Uh...
(Sighs)

32:01.705 --> 32:03.472
Nothing.

32:09.446 --> 32:12.248
(Exhales and sighs)

32:12.316 --> 32:14.217
Mmm.
(Kisses)

32:18.021 --> 32:19.856
Where do you think
you're going?

32:19.923 --> 32:22.024
I was just gonna get
a glass of water.

32:22.092 --> 32:24.527
Oh.
I will get that for you.

32:24.595 --> 32:26.162
You will?

32:26.230 --> 32:29.265
Sure.
Well, right after this.

32:33.603 --> 32:35.604
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

32:37.140 --> 32:38.974
Settled back in okay?

32:39.041 --> 32:40.475
Home sweet couch.

32:40.543 --> 32:42.310
Good.
(Typing)

32:42.978 --> 32:44.612
You know, if I didn't
know better,

32:44.680 --> 32:46.814
I'd say you still have
feelings for me.

32:46.882 --> 32:48.916
What?
(Laughs) Please.

32:48.984 --> 32:52.120
I don't know. You were pretty
freaked out back at my place.

32:52.187 --> 32:53.588
Because I like
sleeping with you.

32:53.655 --> 32:55.056
And I didn't want you to die.

32:55.124 --> 32:56.991
Liking sleeping with you
and not wanting you to die

32:57.059 --> 32:58.559
is not the same
as having feelings,

32:58.627 --> 33:00.762
which I don't have...
for you.

33:00.829 --> 33:03.164
I saw your face, Abby.

33:03.232 --> 33:04.666
I know you.

33:06.802 --> 33:08.736
Admit it.

33:08.804 --> 33:10.038
Fine.

33:10.105 --> 33:11.873
Fine?

33:11.940 --> 33:14.976
Maybe I have...

33:15.644 --> 33:17.111
some feelings.

33:17.178 --> 33:19.713
It's funny, you know.
You can admit to having

33:19.780 --> 33:22.215
feelings for me, but you can't
admit you stole my Cytron card.

33:22.283 --> 33:25.218
You can like me, but you can't
admit you ruined my life.

33:25.286 --> 33:27.254
I didn't steal the cytron card!

33:27.321 --> 33:28.822
(Sighs)

33:28.889 --> 33:30.323
I can forgive a lot of things.

33:30.391 --> 33:31.691
I didn't know how many
things until now,

33:31.759 --> 33:33.727
but it turns out it's a lot.

33:33.794 --> 33:37.530
What I can't do is let myself
love someone I can't trust.

33:41.636 --> 33:43.770
(Exhales)

34:06.193 --> 34:08.561
(Quinn) Something's wrong
with your security cameras.

34:08.628 --> 34:10.195
There's nothing wrong
with my ca...

34:10.263 --> 34:11.597
Really?
Then explain this.

34:13.600 --> 34:14.934
(Typing)

34:26.277 --> 34:27.212
Where'd I go?

34:27.279 --> 34:28.413
Dude, that's weird.

34:28.481 --> 34:29.681
Now, look at this feed.

34:29.748 --> 34:31.583
Look at this piece
of wood right here.

34:31.650 --> 34:33.485
It's the same piece of wood
that's on the other screen here.

34:34.351 --> 34:36.853
Why would there be two cameras
facing the same hallway?

34:36.922 --> 34:40.056
Because someone turned
one of them around on purpose

34:40.125 --> 34:41.625
because they didn't want you
to see what they were doing

34:41.693 --> 34:42.393
in that hallway.

34:43.261 --> 34:45.129
Damn, girl.
(Keys rattle)

34:45.197 --> 34:46.496
It's in the details, Zeke.

34:46.565 --> 34:47.431
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

34:47.500 --> 34:49.100
(Panting)

34:49.168 --> 34:53.205
(Door slams, door opens)

34:53.272 --> 34:54.206
(Door closes)

34:56.475 --> 34:58.975
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

35:06.184 --> 35:08.684
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

35:12.123 --> 35:13.356
(Under breath) Oh, my God.

35:13.424 --> 35:16.026
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

35:16.094 --> 35:17.861
(Grunting)

35:22.433 --> 35:23.533
(Jiggling crowbar)

35:24.836 --> 35:26.770
(Clang)

35:26.838 --> 35:29.139
(Panting)

35:29.207 --> 35:31.408
Huck! Huck!
Are you okay?

35:31.476 --> 35:34.277
(Panting)

35:34.345 --> 35:35.512
Oh...

35:35.580 --> 35:36.747
(Moans)

35:36.814 --> 35:38.415
Huck! Huck! Are you okay?

35:38.483 --> 35:40.951
Are you okay, huck? Huck?
(Panting)

36:08.511 --> 36:10.012
(Pours water)

36:13.950 --> 36:15.250
(Clears throat)

36:15.518 --> 36:16.952
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

36:20.789 --> 36:21.789
(Remote control clicks)

36:25.392 --> 36:27.460
(Door whirring open)

36:46.546 --> 36:47.746
(Breathing unevenly)

36:48.150 --> 36:49.418
It's not what you think.

36:50.985 --> 36:53.153
What is this? Who are you?

36:53.221 --> 36:55.823
- Sit down. Let's talk.
- Sit down?

36:55.890 --> 36:57.891
No, you need to get
the hell away from me.

36:57.959 --> 36:59.860
Stop moving right now!

36:59.928 --> 37:02.428
I can't let you leave, Olivia.

37:02.430 --> 37:05.466
(Panting)

37:06.768 --> 37:08.101
Hey...
(Grunts)

37:08.169 --> 37:11.171
(Both grunting)

37:14.075 --> 37:15.742
(Shrieks) (Grunts)

37:15.810 --> 37:17.077
(Thuds)
Ow! Aah!

37:17.145 --> 37:19.012
Aah! Aah!

37:19.080 --> 37:20.447
Stop!

37:20.515 --> 37:22.816
I'm not going to hurt you.
Calm down!

37:22.884 --> 37:25.119
Who are you?
Why are you spying on me?

37:25.186 --> 37:26.253
To protect you.

37:26.321 --> 37:27.921
Protect me from what?!

37:28.189 --> 37:29.222
From him.

37:29.290 --> 37:31.825
(Panting)

37:34.095 --> 37:36.263
(Gasps)

37:36.331 --> 37:37.397
Olivia...

37:40.535 --> 37:41.501
Olivia!

37:41.569 --> 37:42.803
Olivia!

37:42.870 --> 37:45.205
(Muffled voice) Olivia!

37:52.826 --> 37:53.993
(Cell phone vibrating)

37:57.197 --> 37:59.699
(Beep)

37:59.767 --> 38:01.067
Mr. President?

38:01.135 --> 38:03.269
You work things out?

38:03.337 --> 38:04.504
Sorry, sir?

38:04.571 --> 38:06.272
With James.

38:07.608 --> 38:10.276
I'm... back home.

38:10.344 --> 38:12.312
Well, that's good.

38:12.379 --> 38:13.780
That's a start.

38:13.847 --> 38:16.616
(Breathes unevenly)
It's a start.

38:18.786 --> 38:21.988
Why are you calling,
Mr. President?

38:31.331 --> 38:33.432
I killed Verna Thornton.

38:33.500 --> 38:36.368
(Exhales)

38:36.436 --> 38:37.369
(Exhales)

38:47.914 --> 38:51.316
Would she forgive me...

38:52.384 --> 38:53.751
if she knew?

38:55.654 --> 38:57.455
There are things...

38:57.522 --> 38:59.323
(Breathing unevenly)
We don't tell them.

38:59.391 --> 39:01.392
Things we never tell them.

39:02.060 --> 39:04.127
Things we bury.
Things we hide.

39:04.195 --> 39:06.129
That's the job.

39:09.701 --> 39:13.737
You did something... sir.

39:13.805 --> 39:16.140
It doesn't mean you don't
deserve to be happy.

39:16.207 --> 39:18.509
(Knock on door)
Mr. President, there's a situation.

39:18.576 --> 39:20.944
- I gotta go, Cy.
- Good night, sir.

39:28.519 --> 39:29.852
(Panting)

39:29.920 --> 39:31.721
- Has he said anything yet?
- Not a word.

39:31.789 --> 39:33.790
I saw him after being
waterboarded for days.

39:33.857 --> 39:35.758
- This is worse?
- Incomparably worse.

39:35.826 --> 39:37.593
- And Liv? - She's still not
answering her phone.

39:37.661 --> 39:39.328
(Cell phone vibrates)

39:39.396 --> 39:40.997
Yeah?

39:43.500 --> 39:45.134
We'll be right there.

39:46.136 --> 39:47.970
(Beep)

39:48.738 --> 39:49.705
It's Molly.

39:56.746 --> 39:59.014
- (Harrison) Yeah, that's her.
- That's Molly Ackerman.

39:59.082 --> 40:00.616
She didn't have any I.D. on her.
Just her cell.

40:00.683 --> 40:01.884
Your number kept coming up
on her caller I.D.

40:01.951 --> 40:03.418
You said it was
a hit-and-run?

40:03.486 --> 40:05.254
Yeah, some jerk ran a red,
smashed into her.

40:05.321 --> 40:06.655
Poor thing didn't stand a chance.

40:06.723 --> 40:08.524
Thanks for coming down.
Here's hoping

40:08.591 --> 40:10.526
I don't see any more
of you people this week.

40:10.593 --> 40:11.927
Hit-and-run, my ass.

40:11.995 --> 40:14.163
Looks like the mole took her
out before she could talk.

40:14.230 --> 40:15.631
Take a look at this.

40:16.699 --> 40:18.666
This guy shows up an hour
before huck goes in,

40:18.734 --> 40:20.701
and then...

40:20.769 --> 40:22.904
He comes back to the elevator
20 minutes after huck arrived.

40:22.971 --> 40:24.572
So this guy was there
around the same time.

40:24.640 --> 40:26.174
- That doesn't prove anything.
- Both times...

40:26.241 --> 40:27.875
Going in and going out,
he was empty-handed.

40:27.943 --> 40:29.544
Who goes into a storage
unit with nothing

40:29.611 --> 40:31.512
- and comes out with nothing?
- No one.

40:31.580 --> 40:34.816
Whoever that is, he's the one...
The one who hurt huck.

40:34.883 --> 40:36.317
- And probably killed Molly.
- And Wendy.

40:36.385 --> 40:38.519
- You think he's our Albatross?
- No.

40:38.587 --> 40:40.521
A guy like Albatross doesn't
do his own dirty work.

40:40.589 --> 40:42.523
Baseball cap works for Albatross.

40:42.591 --> 40:45.026
(Cell phone rings)

40:45.793 --> 40:47.528
You better have
a damn good reason.

40:47.595 --> 40:49.263
Why are you calling me
at home this late?

40:49.330 --> 40:50.764
All right, calm down, chief.

40:50.832 --> 40:53.167
There's been a development.

40:58.339 --> 40:59.406
Hey.

40:59.474 --> 41:01.041
(Monitor beeping steadily)

41:01.109 --> 41:03.010
You know, you had
a pretty bad concussion.

41:08.382 --> 41:10.050
They've got you
under observation.

41:10.117 --> 41:11.685
I never knew what
that meant until now.

41:11.752 --> 41:13.053
From what I can tell,
it means a nurse

41:13.120 --> 41:14.421
will come in here
every five minutes,

41:14.488 --> 41:16.590
wake you up, and ask
if you're resting okay.

41:18.960 --> 41:21.160
I don't have time to explain
everything, Olivia.

41:21.228 --> 41:23.062
Here's what you say...
You were at your apartment.

41:23.130 --> 41:24.831
There was a break-in.
A man attacked you.

41:24.898 --> 41:26.732
I showed up and saved you.

41:26.800 --> 41:28.434
You never met me until now.

41:28.502 --> 41:30.903
Do you understand me?

41:30.971 --> 41:32.572
Olivia, this is very important.

41:34.942 --> 41:36.175
Do you understand?

41:46.453 --> 41:48.153
Thanks for calling me, Jake.

41:48.221 --> 41:50.022
You're welcome, sir.
We had a bit of a scare,

41:50.089 --> 41:51.623
but she's gonna be all right.
It's lucky you were there.

42:00.500 --> 42:02.468
(Door closes)

42:05.705 --> 42:07.406
Hi.

42:45.745 --> 42:48.514
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)
