WEBVTT

00:04.819 --> 00:06.152
You have to stop.

00:06.153 --> 00:08.922
I can't keep letting you put
yourself, or me through this.

00:09.095 --> 00:10.158
I promise...

00:11.092 --> 00:12.592
no more.

00:12.593 --> 00:15.395
It has been nine years since I've
even come close to using my powers.

00:15.822 --> 00:18.424
Do you remember why you
became Black Lightning?

00:18.425 --> 00:19.927
You wanted to give the people hope.

00:20.998 --> 00:23.095
Somebody has to do something,

00:23.096 --> 00:25.949
because all of this policing,
and marching, and praying,

00:25.950 --> 00:27.968
it hasn't changed anything.

00:32.837 --> 00:36.575
It is time that people know
that Black Lightning...

00:38.109 --> 00:39.177
is back.

00:41.412 --> 00:43.280
Previously on Black Lightning...

00:43.281 --> 00:44.781
Tori, I missed you.

00:44.782 --> 00:46.449
I missed you too, big brother.

00:46.450 --> 00:48.419
I'm not gonna tell you
how to run your crew,

00:48.420 --> 00:50.655
but you need to take Black Lightning out,

00:50.656 --> 00:53.457
and button this thing up quick.

00:53.458 --> 00:54.792
My name is Tobias Whale.

00:54.793 --> 00:56.227
I understand what you're going through.

00:56.228 --> 00:58.697
Black Lightning messed my life up, too.

00:58.698 --> 01:01.432
Look, the purpose of Black
Lightning was to kill Tobias.

01:01.433 --> 01:04.803
He's shoving my father's articles
down his throat until he died.

01:07.339 --> 01:10.807
Grace, if I could make people who did
bad things pay for what they did,

01:10.808 --> 01:12.276
that would be a good thing, right?

01:12.277 --> 01:13.510
I found these on my student.

01:13.511 --> 01:15.111
And he was so out of
control that the only way

01:15.112 --> 01:17.848
I could keep him from hurting
anyone was to blast him.

01:17.849 --> 01:19.316
Twice.

01:19.317 --> 01:21.520
Must be this new drug, Green
Light I've been hearing about.

01:27.426 --> 01:28.894
You sure about this?

01:29.661 --> 01:31.129
In theory.

01:32.463 --> 01:35.500
That's not exactly the vote of
confidence I was hoping for.

01:53.952 --> 01:55.153
So?

01:57.322 --> 01:59.024
This is one hell of a view.

01:59.457 --> 02:00.859
Okay.

02:01.693 --> 02:03.395
Ready to give this thing a little juice?

02:04.262 --> 02:05.864
You know, I thought you'd never ask.

02:10.901 --> 02:12.404
Really, really, really good.

02:25.316 --> 02:26.784
I just found my new favorite thing.

02:26.785 --> 02:27.953
But, okay.

02:28.620 --> 02:29.554
Let's try something simple.

02:39.864 --> 02:41.133
Stop.

03:05.524 --> 03:06.858
Put your guns away.

03:09.560 --> 03:10.896
All right, easy now, son.

03:20.004 --> 03:22.073
Look, stop. No, I... I don't wanna...

03:32.450 --> 03:33.550
Call for an ambulance.

03:33.551 --> 03:35.586
This kid is definitely
high on Green Light.

03:35.587 --> 03:38.090
Next time, try using a Taser first.

03:38.423 --> 03:39.591
Yes, sir.

03:45.629 --> 03:47.065
Nice job.

03:50.835 --> 03:52.237
You heading back?

03:56.675 --> 03:57.876
No.

03:58.610 --> 04:01.079
No. I wanna practice some more.

04:31.442 --> 04:33.611
Been a long time, Gambi.

04:33.612 --> 04:34.845
Not long enough.

04:34.846 --> 04:36.313
We had a deal.

04:36.314 --> 04:38.148
You're not supposed to be here.

04:38.149 --> 04:39.983
You're supposed to be gone, forever.

04:39.984 --> 04:41.453
I need a new suit.

04:42.854 --> 04:45.489
Only thing I'm gonna measure
you for is a coffin.

04:45.490 --> 04:47.392
I'll be here long after you're gone.

04:49.193 --> 04:50.927
Just cause you got that serum pumping through
your veins that's keeping you from aging,

04:50.928 --> 04:53.297
doesn't mean that you and your sister
are gonna have a happy ending.

04:53.298 --> 04:55.932
You think they told you everything
before they gave it to you?

04:55.933 --> 04:57.701
What they didn't tell me,
I've already figured out.

04:57.702 --> 05:00.704
Another thing I've figured out is
you're still working for the ASA,

05:00.705 --> 05:03.341
which makes you privy to
all kinds of information.

05:04.075 --> 05:05.877
What I need from you is a name.

05:07.878 --> 05:09.514
Who is Black Lightning?

05:10.948 --> 05:11.949
I can't help you.

05:11.950 --> 05:13.750
Oh, I think you can.

05:13.751 --> 05:16.019
Knowing things about Black
Lightning gets men killed.

05:16.020 --> 05:18.789
I do my best to avoid knowing
things that can get me killed.

05:18.790 --> 05:21.927
Not telling me what I need to
know can get you killed, too.

05:23.694 --> 05:27.564
I'll admit, Black Lightning has
become a personal problem.

05:27.565 --> 05:30.702
I'm guessing his presence in Freeland
is a problem for you as well.

05:34.872 --> 05:37.242
Only problem I have is you.

05:48.286 --> 05:49.588
Gambi...

05:54.258 --> 05:56.061
I'll see you later.

Look, people, there's a pattern here

06:30.728 --> 06:33.064
and I've been connecting the dots.

06:33.931 --> 06:36.099
The Tuskegee Experiments used syphilis.

The Flint water crisis used le...

06:39.604 --> 06:40.938
What are you doing? Get out.

06:40.939 --> 06:42.205
- Why? You watching porn?
- I'm studying,

06:42.206 --> 06:44.307
and you need to respect my privacy.

06:44.308 --> 06:45.943
I don't know why you moved
back in the first place.

06:45.944 --> 06:48.344
- Once I go to college, I'm gone for good.
- You know what, out.

06:48.345 --> 06:50.847
Listen, I'm just getting the
gray jacket, and then I'm gone.

06:50.848 --> 06:52.316
No, let's go.

06:52.317 --> 06:55.118
Kiesha and I are going skating.
I wanna look fly. What's this?

06:55.119 --> 06:56.953
It was for a costume party.

06:56.954 --> 06:58.188
Okay, so you into bondage now?

06:58.189 --> 06:59.956
- What were you, Whips and Chains?
- You know...

06:59.957 --> 07:02.025
- Take the jacket.
- Okay, I'll take it.

07:02.026 --> 07:03.593
Please go.

07:03.594 --> 07:04.995
- Thank you.
- Bye.

07:04.996 --> 07:06.130
And shut the door, please.

07:07.965 --> 07:09.800
I said shut the door.

07:09.801 --> 07:11.102
Love you.

Legionnaires'. Don't believe me?
CNN, March 30th, 1987.

07:23.281 --> 07:26.383
Thirty years ago in Freeland,

07:26.384 --> 07:31.289
nine kids, all of whom displayed enhanced
abilities, suddenly disappeared.

07:41.666 --> 07:43.900
Hey! Can you hurry your ass up?

07:43.901 --> 07:45.669
I came to skate, not to pose for selfies.

07:45.670 --> 07:46.970
Yes, I'm aware. Thank you.

07:46.971 --> 07:48.105
Come on.

07:48.106 --> 07:49.906
You gonna fall.

07:49.907 --> 07:52.076
Get out there. I'll be there in a second.

07:52.077 --> 07:53.244
All right, girl.

08:03.376 --> 08:05.991
You gonna need a lot more
than lip gloss to help that face.

08:08.226 --> 08:09.426
Lana.

08:09.427 --> 08:12.729
Damn, girl, you still mad I
dusted you on your track

08:12.730 --> 08:15.100
in front of the entire school?

08:15.834 --> 08:17.067
You really think you're all that?

08:17.068 --> 08:18.870
Oh, honey, I know I'm all that.

08:20.004 --> 08:24.576
Okay, well, I guess Khalil and his
days of dusting fools are over, though.

08:25.109 --> 08:27.245
With his crippled ass.

08:27.978 --> 08:29.080
Oh, okay.

08:29.914 --> 08:31.116
You're still pissed he dumped you?

08:32.116 --> 08:33.817
Well, maybe instead of
worrying about Khalil,

08:33.818 --> 08:37.589
you should be worried about putting
some lotion on those dusty-ass knees.

08:41.025 --> 08:43.328
You know what, I've been waiting to
knock you out since sixth grade.

09:09.770 --> 09:11.024
Her fever is sky high.

09:11.191 --> 09:13.192
She's gettin' worse. She's weak.

09:13.193 --> 09:14.894
- Dude, it's our policy.
- I told you.

09:14.895 --> 09:18.731
I got home, opened up the bottle
and it was nothing but dust,

09:18.732 --> 09:21.734
so you need to replace it or
give me my damn money back.

09:21.735 --> 09:23.602
Look, I can't take used medicine back.

09:23.603 --> 09:25.037
Bruh, that's what I'm trying
to tell you, it ain't used.

09:25.038 --> 09:26.639
That's why her fever's up.

09:26.640 --> 09:29.142
And that's why I'm still here talking
to you after working a double.

09:29.143 --> 09:31.412
Come on, the man has a sick kid.

09:33.847 --> 09:35.348
This expired three years ago.

09:35.349 --> 09:36.649
Dude, I just sell what they give me.

09:36.650 --> 09:38.685
Oh, come on. That is the
oldest excuse in the world.

09:38.686 --> 09:41.420
"I just sell what they give me.
I just do what I'm told."

09:41.421 --> 09:43.122
You're not a robot, son,
you're a human being.

09:43.123 --> 09:46.058
So how about you act like one and help
this young man and his daughter out.

09:46.059 --> 09:48.028
I can't do it.

09:53.420 --> 09:56.570
Look, I promise you, that bat is not gonna
end up where you're expecting it to.

10:00.541 --> 10:01.842
Yo, you all right?

10:03.243 --> 10:04.678
Yeah.

10:07.514 --> 10:09.083
Yeah, I'm good.

10:10.651 --> 10:12.318
- Look, I'm sorry.
- Look, if...

10:12.319 --> 10:15.623
if it was my call, I'd do it.
But it's... it's not.

10:16.923 --> 10:18.091
I'll tell you what,

10:18.092 --> 10:22.662
how about we find a
box that is not expired,

10:22.663 --> 10:25.764
and... I'll buy you that medicine.

10:25.765 --> 10:27.166
- No, I'm all right, bruh.
- No, no, no.

10:27.167 --> 10:29.869
This is not a handout. I'm
expecting you to pay me back.

10:30.752 --> 10:32.038
Next time you find someone in need,

10:32.039 --> 10:34.875
help them out, we're even. Cool?

10:40.374 --> 10:41.415
Cool.

10:49.668 --> 10:53.072
_

10:59.166 --> 11:04.037
My sources tell me, David Poe, the
editor of the Freeland Gazette,

11:04.038 --> 11:07.473
canceled a series of articles which
would've exposed the vaccine

11:07.474 --> 11:10.176
as the source of those
enhanced abilities.

11:10.177 --> 11:12.346
The reporter was Alvin Pierce.

11:12.813 --> 11:14.213
Grandpa?

11:14.214 --> 11:17.885
He was murdered a week later.
His murder was never solved.

11:41.508 --> 11:43.877
_

11:43.878 --> 11:47.393
_

12:36.563 --> 12:38.198
I watch TV.

12:39.232 --> 12:41.634
I know who you are, and
I ain't scared of you.

12:41.635 --> 12:44.871
What I don't know is, why
are you here at my place?

12:44.872 --> 12:47.774
Why do you have a factory's
worth of chemicals here?

12:47.775 --> 12:50.409
What I have or don't have
ain't no business of yours.

12:50.410 --> 12:51.677
I asked you a question.

12:51.678 --> 12:54.213
Look here, you electrified lawn jockey,

12:54.214 --> 12:56.716
you're a wanted man, and
you're trespassing,

12:56.717 --> 13:00.319
which means I can shoot your black
ass and I'll be called a hero.

13:00.320 --> 13:02.189
Mother...

13:05.659 --> 13:07.092
Now let's try this again.

13:07.093 --> 13:08.628
What are the chemicals for?

13:12.232 --> 13:13.432
Green Light.

13:13.433 --> 13:14.666
It's not mine. It's... it's...

13:14.667 --> 13:16.935
I usually pick up and deliver.

13:16.936 --> 13:18.304
This time, they gave me a little extra

13:18.305 --> 13:19.705
- to keep it around.
- Who's "they"?

13:19.706 --> 13:22.107
I don't know his name.

13:22.108 --> 13:23.375
Did you just lie to me?

13:23.376 --> 13:24.810
No, no, I didn't.

13:24.811 --> 13:25.980
Then why don't I believe you?

13:29.650 --> 13:31.085
Joey Toledo.

13:31.885 --> 13:34.788
His name is Joey Toledo.

13:39.592 --> 13:41.293
I don't get it.

13:41.294 --> 13:44.396
I mean, how could you, you of all people,

13:44.397 --> 13:46.365
not know that Joey Toledo was back?

13:46.366 --> 13:48.301
- Jefferson...
- No, don't "Jefferson" me.

13:48.302 --> 13:50.269
You're supposed to have your
finger on the pulse of Freeland.

13:50.270 --> 13:54.239
Now we are talking about the guy worked
for the man who killed my father.

13:54.240 --> 13:57.344
Look, I... I can't even say for
certain that he ever left.

14:00.581 --> 14:04.784
What I can say for certain is that I
haven't heard about him in a long time.

14:04.785 --> 14:06.687
So, calm down.

14:09.355 --> 14:13.359
Joey Toledo was Tobias's right-hand man.

14:13.360 --> 14:17.230
If he is still around, then
Tobias is still around.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.999
- It's certainly possible.
- Not certainly possible!

14:20.000 --> 14:22.335
If Tobias is still out
there dealing Green Light,

14:22.336 --> 14:23.736
I have to have him.

14:23.737 --> 14:26.673
If that means going through
Joey Toledo, even better.

14:29.176 --> 14:30.476
Jefferson!

14:30.897 --> 14:32.046
Jefferson.

14:32.712 --> 14:34.214
Jeff?

14:40.183 --> 14:41.459
If I'd brought him to the hospital,

14:41.460 --> 14:43.896
there would've been too many
questions which I couldn't answer.

14:44.696 --> 14:46.665
You did the right thing.

14:48.066 --> 14:50.336
Based on these diagnostics, it
wasn't a stroke or a heart attack.

14:51.737 --> 14:54.640
He's been having headaches and
exhibiting aggressive behavior.

14:55.073 --> 14:56.308
For how long?

14:57.109 --> 14:58.811
I don't know.

15:01.079 --> 15:05.017
But I don't see anything that would cause
a headache or a change in behavior.

15:10.855 --> 15:12.356
Could this be Black Lightning related?

15:12.357 --> 15:14.025
He hasn't had any problems before,

15:14.026 --> 15:16.996
but the suit's got a
new hover function...

15:17.562 --> 15:18.397
Jeff?

15:18.398 --> 15:20.165
...Jeff?

15:30.609 --> 15:32.209
I don't know what I'm...
What am I doin' here?

15:32.210 --> 15:33.545
You passed out.

15:35.314 --> 15:38.117
- Lynn?
- It's okay, just relax. Okay?

15:41.619 --> 15:43.621
- I've gotta get Joey Toledo.
- No.

15:43.622 --> 15:46.424
You're not going anywhere until I
figure out what's going on with you.

15:47.392 --> 15:49.962
I need you to stay here and rest.

15:51.764 --> 15:53.232
Can you do that?

16:03.141 --> 16:07.446
Well, this is some ominous lighting.

16:08.346 --> 16:09.448
What's going on?

16:10.048 --> 16:11.650
I paid the tailor a visit.

16:13.318 --> 16:14.819
Why would you do that?

16:14.820 --> 16:16.721
Thought he'd give me Black
Lightning's identity,

16:16.722 --> 16:18.890
help me find him, so I could kill him.

16:18.891 --> 16:21.060
Lady Eve won't be happy.

16:22.193 --> 16:23.828
I'm not afraid of Lady Eve.

16:23.829 --> 16:27.931
This is not about fear,
it's about strategy.

16:27.932 --> 16:29.166
You're being reckless.

16:29.167 --> 16:31.035
I'm their top earner.

16:31.036 --> 16:33.937
When her cartel asked me to put Green Light
on the streets, I put it on every corner.

16:33.938 --> 16:36.306
I deserve a seat at the
table next to her.

16:36.307 --> 16:37.307
Patience.

16:37.308 --> 16:39.510
You'll get there.

16:39.511 --> 16:42.079
You know they're using Black Lightning's
return as an excuse to not promote me,

16:42.080 --> 16:44.215
so I'm stuck babysitting The One Hundred.

16:44.216 --> 16:46.517
Tori, I'm tired of
managing these Negroes.

16:46.518 --> 16:49.186
When I was city council
member, I had sovereignty,

16:49.187 --> 16:50.721
I conducted real business.

16:50.722 --> 16:52.690
Lady Eve and the rest of
them gave me respect.

16:52.691 --> 16:54.091
They respected me like an equal.

16:54.092 --> 16:57.029
Okay. Okay, calm down.

16:58.663 --> 17:03.200
You are making bad decisions because you
haven't dealt with your root problem.

17:03.201 --> 17:04.303
What do you mean?

17:05.436 --> 17:08.207
You never dealt with your first enemy,

17:08.940 --> 17:10.709
your worst enemy.

17:11.876 --> 17:13.878
And you can't forgive yourself.

17:15.213 --> 17:16.614
Good news.

17:19.050 --> 17:20.819
I found Eldridge.

17:28.126 --> 17:32.329
There's not a day I go get the mail when
there's not at least one medical bill.

17:32.330 --> 17:34.465
I spend my whole day working the line

17:34.466 --> 17:37.001
just so I can come home
and give half my paycheck

17:37.002 --> 17:38.435
to taking care of your pale ass.

17:38.436 --> 17:39.737
So what?

17:39.738 --> 17:41.139
"So what?" It's my money!

17:41.140 --> 17:44.676
To think, I was happy.
"It's a boy, Eldridge."

17:46.177 --> 17:49.280
I was gonna watch you play sports,
teach you how to drive a car.

17:49.281 --> 17:51.048
Look at you, you can't
even take your pale ass

17:51.049 --> 17:52.450
out on the front porch.

17:52.451 --> 17:54.985
- I can do anything anybody else can do.
- No, you can't.

17:54.986 --> 17:56.453
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't!

17:56.454 --> 17:58.389
- Yes, I can!
- You ain't normal!

17:58.390 --> 17:59.657
Look at you. You ain't black.

17:59.658 --> 18:01.993
You ain't white. You ain't nothing.

18:01.994 --> 18:03.528
Dad, don't!

18:03.529 --> 18:06.365
What... what, you got something
you want to say, huh?

18:07.031 --> 18:08.932
Sit your pale ass down.

18:08.933 --> 18:10.768
- Stop it.
- Or what, huh?

18:10.769 --> 18:11.703
Shut up!

18:18.276 --> 18:19.645
Tobias?

18:21.679 --> 18:23.282
Tobias?

18:24.416 --> 18:28.686
I've read about overcoming
childhood stuff.

18:28.687 --> 18:32.724
Believe me, we handle this business,

18:33.491 --> 18:35.527
you'll be a new man.

18:40.932 --> 18:42.367
Where is he?

18:43.401 --> 18:44.636
Hey, Dad?

18:45.236 --> 18:46.937
Hey. What's going on?

18:48.907 --> 18:50.375
Nothing much.

18:55.947 --> 18:57.082
What's on your mind?

18:59.951 --> 19:01.120
Grandpa.

19:03.533 --> 19:04.488
What about him?

19:04.489 --> 19:05.756
Well, I'm doing some research

19:05.757 --> 19:09.394
on a school project and it's
about family histories.

19:10.395 --> 19:12.630
Grandpa's work explored
some strange stuff,

19:12.631 --> 19:15.099
like enhanced abilities, missing kids.
I wanted...

19:15.100 --> 19:18.937
Yeah, your grandfather
had a lot of wild ideas

19:19.671 --> 19:21.173
about a lot of things.

19:22.807 --> 19:26.612
Okay, I'm sorry. I know talking about
Grandpa is hard for you, so I'm sorry.

19:29.414 --> 19:30.516
No.

19:33.318 --> 19:34.620
I'm sorry.

19:35.420 --> 19:37.856
You deserve to know who he was.

19:39.224 --> 19:40.826
Your grandfather...

19:43.728 --> 19:46.098
he always did the right thing.

19:46.597 --> 19:48.299
Always.

19:48.300 --> 19:51.036
Yeah, I see a lot of him in you.

19:54.205 --> 19:55.440
Thanks, Dad.

19:56.141 --> 19:57.509
Yeah.

20:04.507 --> 20:07.317
_

20:07.318 --> 20:09.486
Thank you for seeing me so late.

20:09.487 --> 20:12.256
How long have you been the
editor of the Freeland Gazette?

20:12.257 --> 20:14.325
Over 40 years.

20:14.326 --> 20:15.893
- Wow.
- Hey...

20:15.894 --> 20:18.695
your grandfather was a good man.

20:18.696 --> 20:20.666
And a hell of a reporter.

20:22.667 --> 20:24.236
Now what can I do for you?

20:25.437 --> 20:27.771
So I have been doing research
into my grandfather, right,

20:27.772 --> 20:30.642
and I was wondering if I could
ask you some questions?

20:31.609 --> 20:33.879
Well, that depends on
what you want to ask.

20:35.080 --> 20:37.749
I wanted to ask about the
expose on those missing kids.

20:43.088 --> 20:45.924
I have a story I need to work on

20:46.758 --> 20:48.694
for the morning edition.

20:51.630 --> 20:53.330
Wait, did I say something wrong?

20:53.331 --> 20:54.998
- I need to go.
- Mr. Poe?

20:54.999 --> 20:56.367
And you need to leave, now.

20:56.368 --> 20:59.369
I apologize if I offended
you, but I didn't mean to...

20:59.370 --> 21:00.872
Young lady,

21:01.706 --> 21:04.474
out of respect for your grandfather,

21:04.475 --> 21:06.545
I'm gonna say this nicely.

21:08.213 --> 21:09.381
Get out.

21:11.182 --> 21:12.784
You know, I read up on you.

21:13.851 --> 21:16.888
I heard you were a champion
for the common people.

21:28.800 --> 21:30.469
Pretty jumpy for a cop.

21:31.770 --> 21:34.205
You keep rolling up on me like
that, you're gonna get shot.

21:35.140 --> 21:37.040
You turning yourself in?

21:37.041 --> 21:38.475
Wishful thinking, Inspector.

21:38.476 --> 21:40.543
You've been causing a lot of problems.

21:40.544 --> 21:42.080
And you ain't changed much.

21:42.580 --> 21:43.713
Change is overrated.

21:43.714 --> 21:44.683
I'm here to help, man.

21:44.684 --> 21:46.250
I don't need your help.

21:46.251 --> 21:48.385
Yeah, you do, just like before.

21:48.386 --> 21:49.553
Maybe more this time.

21:49.554 --> 21:51.523
The Green Light drug is out of control.

21:52.791 --> 21:54.057
There's been so many overdoses,

21:54.058 --> 21:56.894
the first responders
started carrying naloxone.

21:56.895 --> 22:01.264
Got a name of a guy who's either at
or near the top of the food chain.

22:01.265 --> 22:02.332
Joey Toledo.

22:02.333 --> 22:04.602
Joey Toledo?

22:04.603 --> 22:06.737
- Thought he was long gone.
- No. He's back.

22:06.738 --> 22:09.373
He's all up in the Green Light.

22:09.374 --> 22:10.941
Now if you know of a way to find him,

22:10.942 --> 22:13.143
I don't need a warrant.

22:13.144 --> 22:15.579
If I decided to do that,
how would I get a hold...

22:15.580 --> 22:17.449
Look in your car.

22:28.694 --> 22:30.027
Are you serious?

22:30.028 --> 22:32.930
Hey, I'm old-school. It's safer.

22:32.931 --> 22:36.399
Consider this the black signal.

22:36.400 --> 22:39.738
...Yeah. You still got jokes, huh?

22:44.342 --> 22:46.545
And you still do that.

22:48.611 --> 22:51.353
So, I heard you've been trying
go back as Black Lightning.

22:52.354 --> 22:54.023
I can't believe Gambi told you.

22:54.623 --> 22:55.892
We're worried about you.

22:56.692 --> 22:58.060
Yeah, but, Lynn, people are dying.

22:58.061 --> 23:00.363
And the last thing that I want
is for people to get hurt.

23:01.297 --> 23:03.099
But they're not my priority...

23:04.100 --> 23:05.735
you are.

23:17.913 --> 23:20.148
Now, what happened exactly?

23:20.149 --> 23:21.850
She broke Lana's wrist.

23:21.851 --> 23:24.453
I had to take her to two
doctors to get this fixed.

23:24.454 --> 23:26.288
And honestly I don't
have that kind of money.

23:26.289 --> 23:27.856
Look like he do, though.

23:27.857 --> 23:29.991
We should have called the police
like I said, have her ass arrested.

23:29.992 --> 23:31.259
Okay, we... we need to calm down.

23:31.260 --> 23:33.494
What the hell you mean, "calm down"?

23:33.495 --> 23:35.097
Gina, I told you, I got this.

23:35.098 --> 23:37.032
Well, get it.

23:37.033 --> 23:39.167
'Cause it seems like to me this man want
to pretend like ain't nothin' happened.

23:39.168 --> 23:40.302
- No, I'm not saying that.
- He didn't even...

23:40.303 --> 23:41.636
Ladies. Ladies.

23:41.637 --> 23:44.472
I understand you're upset, I really do.

23:44.473 --> 23:46.074
And as a woman and a mother,

23:46.075 --> 23:48.610
I know there is nothing more important
than the safety of our kids.

23:51.013 --> 23:53.348
Now, I don't know what
did or didn't happen,

23:53.349 --> 23:57.620
but trust me, we will take full
responsibility for our daughter's actions.

23:59.756 --> 24:01.057
Come in, please.

24:06.061 --> 24:07.163
Please.

24:15.637 --> 24:17.272
...Oh, yeah?

24:17.273 --> 24:19.475
I thought Gina was going to tear off
her earrings and grease up her face.

24:20.609 --> 24:21.910
When it comes to my family,
I do not play, Mr. Pierce.

24:22.346 --> 24:23.378
I will fight you.

24:23.379 --> 24:24.848
Yeah, I see.

24:33.389 --> 24:35.423
Well, I guess we should get going.

24:35.424 --> 24:38.261
Thank you, Lynn, and Mr.
Pierce, thank you.

24:39.161 --> 24:40.562
Thank you. It was a pleasure meeting you.

24:40.563 --> 24:41.898
I'll walk you out.

24:50.773 --> 24:53.041
Thanks for stopping by again, okay?

24:53.261 --> 24:54.413
We'll be in touch.

24:54.414 --> 24:55.299
Okay.

24:56.613 --> 24:57.979
What the hell were you thinking?

24:57.980 --> 24:59.380
Okay, look, it wasn't my fault.

24:59.381 --> 25:00.615
It doesn't matter whose fault it was.

25:00.616 --> 25:02.884
Did you not see the cast on her wrist?

25:02.885 --> 25:04.419
Jennifer, how do
you expect us to feel

25:04.420 --> 25:07.288
when someone shows up to tell
us you were involved in a fight

25:07.289 --> 25:08.456
that we didn't know about?

25:08.457 --> 25:11.526
There were two girls. They
both run for Booker T.

25:11.527 --> 25:13.928
Two girls? Wait, Lana
didn't tell us that part.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.465
You... And you weren't hurt at all?

25:16.332 --> 25:17.333
No, you taught us how
to defend ourselves.

25:18.267 --> 25:20.803
Jeff, this is not a good thing.

25:21.337 --> 25:22.671
Right. Right.

25:22.672 --> 25:24.772
That's no excuse for hurting someone.

25:24.773 --> 25:27.910
- I barely touched them.
- Jennifer, her wrist is broken.

25:27.911 --> 25:30.312
And since grounding seems
to have no effect on you...

25:30.313 --> 25:32.080
Wait, so I'm not being grounded?

25:32.081 --> 25:33.315
Oh, you are.

25:33.316 --> 25:34.984
Why am I getting in trouble
for defending myself?

25:35.617 --> 25:36.851
You're grounded for lying.

25:36.852 --> 25:38.420
I didn't lie, I just didn't
tell you guys about it.

25:38.421 --> 25:41.356
Oh, you really wanna play with
me right now, little girl?

25:42.048 --> 25:42.590
You don't.

25:42.591 --> 25:44.493
Exactly.

25:44.494 --> 25:47.262
And you need to figure out how to resolve
conflict without fighting or losing your temper.

25:47.263 --> 25:49.998
And as your father taught you how
to fight, he can be a big help,

25:49.999 --> 25:54.270
because believe it or not, not everyone
solves their problems with their fists.

25:57.273 --> 25:58.473
Two girls?

25:58.474 --> 25:59.575
Two.

26:06.249 --> 26:07.216
Didn't I kick you out?

26:07.217 --> 26:08.916
Listen, my grandfather was murdered

26:08.917 --> 26:12.454
shortly after investigating enhanced
abilities and those missing kids.

26:12.455 --> 26:14.289
I just need to know what happened.

26:14.290 --> 26:15.959
You sound just like him.

26:17.460 --> 26:19.260
Why didn't you run those articles?

26:19.261 --> 26:21.663
It was the same exact story
you've built your career on.

26:21.664 --> 26:23.865
Well, if you're anything like Alvin,

26:23.866 --> 26:26.567
I know you're not gonna
leave me the hell alone

26:26.568 --> 26:28.004
until you get your way.

26:33.710 --> 26:34.911
I dug this up.

26:37.246 --> 26:38.681
What's this?

26:39.515 --> 26:41.851
I've saved this for over 30 years.

26:42.785 --> 26:45.121
Just holding on to an
old friend, I guess.

26:46.022 --> 26:47.122
Thank you.

26:47.123 --> 26:48.623
This... this means a lot to me.

26:48.624 --> 26:49.659
Good.

26:53.129 --> 26:54.263
Young lady...

26:57.132 --> 27:02.003
Alvin tapped into somethin' far
bigger and much more dangerous

27:02.004 --> 27:04.207
than I care to be a part of.

27:05.274 --> 27:07.375
Jefferson made a good life
for you and your family.

27:07.376 --> 27:09.946
Maybe walking away from this is best.

27:11.594 --> 27:15.685
Alvin said it then, and I still
believe it to be true today,

27:16.685 --> 27:18.087
they're watchin'.

27:19.288 --> 27:21.591
Wait. Who's watching?

27:22.325 --> 27:25.226
I'm sure if you find out,

27:25.227 --> 27:26.796
you'd get killed.

27:28.397 --> 27:31.534
Now go and don't come back.

27:41.277 --> 27:42.812
Who is it?

27:45.348 --> 27:46.816
Who is it?

27:49.485 --> 27:50.787
Eldridge.

28:02.331 --> 28:05.134
You still hit like a little bitch.

28:05.867 --> 28:07.570
What the hell you doing here?

28:08.370 --> 28:10.037
We have some questions to ask you.

28:10.038 --> 28:11.441
About what?

28:12.207 --> 28:14.043
Your parenting skills.

28:16.579 --> 28:18.081
My parenting?

28:19.081 --> 28:20.216
Yeah.

28:20.783 --> 28:22.884
At least I stayed, huh?

28:22.885 --> 28:27.522
I didn't leave in the middle of the
night like your damn mama did.

28:27.523 --> 28:30.191
Instead, I fed you,

28:30.192 --> 28:32.360
and I clothed you.

28:32.361 --> 28:36.632
Even tried to take care of 'em
twitchy-ass eyes of yours.

28:39.768 --> 28:41.068
You're right.

28:41.069 --> 28:43.072
Mom's left, and you stayed.

28:43.872 --> 28:45.942
You did feed and clothe us.

28:49.879 --> 28:51.914
And I can appreciate that.

28:52.581 --> 28:53.883
Now.

28:58.120 --> 28:59.856
Yeah, I can appreciate that.

29:12.234 --> 29:13.936
The question is why?

29:15.804 --> 29:17.605
Why did you stay?

29:17.606 --> 29:19.574
Was it just so you can
have someone to torture,

29:19.575 --> 29:22.244
to beat on, to blame for your failures?

29:22.245 --> 29:24.478
Or was it about collecting
money from the state?

29:24.479 --> 29:26.649
Because it certainly wasn't about love.

29:34.122 --> 29:35.658
You stayed.

29:36.525 --> 29:37.493
Son.

29:37.494 --> 29:38.828
Leave him.

29:39.495 --> 29:41.797
Your back is broken, Eldridge.

29:42.331 --> 29:43.766
You're gonna die,

29:45.134 --> 29:47.069
and you're gonna die slow.

29:53.308 --> 29:54.844
Tobias!

30:04.519 --> 30:07.108
_

30:09.131 --> 30:11.596
_

30:11.597 --> 30:15.968
Alvin said it then, and I still
believe it to be true today,

30:17.069 --> 30:18.603
they're watchin'.

30:18.604 --> 30:19.570
_

30:19.571 --> 30:22.108
Wait. Who's watching?

30:22.942 --> 30:24.977
I'm sure if you find out,

30:25.945 --> 30:27.547
you'd get killed.

30:41.627 --> 30:43.863
"ASF."

30:45.824 --> 30:47.443
_

30:47.444 --> 30:48.924
_

30:48.925 --> 30:51.214
_

31:03.148 --> 31:03.983
Jennifer!

31:03.984 --> 31:06.317
Do you have my black hoodie?

31:06.532 --> 31:08.654
No, I got my own hoodies.

31:09.421 --> 31:10.823
Yeah, right.

31:40.486 --> 31:41.687
This sucks.

31:43.289 --> 31:44.856
Yeah, it does.

31:44.857 --> 31:47.359
I don't know why I'm on punishment.
I didn't start the fight.

31:47.360 --> 31:48.928
Sin of omission.

31:49.862 --> 31:51.663
Our family doesn't communicate that way.

31:51.664 --> 31:52.897
I'm a target.

31:52.898 --> 31:55.033
The daughter of the principal.

31:55.034 --> 31:57.170
They call me the Queen of Garfield, Dad.

32:01.340 --> 32:05.009
"The one thing you can't
take away from me

32:05.010 --> 32:08.514
is the way I choose to respond
to what you do to me."

32:09.648 --> 32:11.050
MLK?

32:12.084 --> 32:15.354
Viktor Frankl, holocaust survivor.

32:16.321 --> 32:18.923
How you respond in a
crisis is your choice,

32:18.924 --> 32:22.960
but to exercise that choice, you
have to recognize your emotions

32:22.961 --> 32:24.695
and regulate them.

32:24.696 --> 32:26.899
Okay, well, what about when somebody's
trying to regulate upside your head?

32:28.500 --> 32:29.902
Look...

32:31.103 --> 32:34.772
fighting should never be about
adding fuel to the fire,

32:34.773 --> 32:37.910
fighting should only be
about putting the fire out.

32:38.777 --> 32:41.981
And often, I mean, not the best choice.

32:42.982 --> 32:49.255
Even when it is so hard
to do, is to walk away.

32:50.222 --> 32:53.059
It's easier said than done, Yoda.

32:54.427 --> 32:56.429
Yeah, I know, my little Padawan.

32:57.896 --> 32:59.565
I know.

33:11.910 --> 33:13.479
Damn it.

33:16.815 --> 33:20.586
All this ass. I'm gonna need
something that really fits.

33:32.064 --> 33:34.600
Well, whoever he is, he's gonna
think he died and went to heaven.

33:35.734 --> 33:36.769
She.

33:37.936 --> 33:39.939
And there's probably gonna
be a room full of them.

33:41.006 --> 33:42.406
Okay. I'm not mad at that.

33:42.407 --> 33:44.543
...So tell me, what's your name?

33:45.877 --> 33:46.977
Monica.

33:47.354 --> 33:50.248
So, we're thinking black, I assume?

33:50.249 --> 33:52.818
I was thinking something a bit brighter.

34:00.726 --> 34:01.894
Leather?

34:08.033 --> 34:09.735
How do you feel about latex?

34:13.605 --> 34:15.040
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

34:15.041 --> 34:16.676
Yeah. I like those.

34:17.176 --> 34:19.210
Red would be great.

34:20.538 --> 34:21.847
No.

34:22.447 --> 34:23.781
Think I got it.

34:23.782 --> 34:25.217
Everything is in there.

34:26.016 --> 34:28.953
Listen, I cannot thank you enough.

34:28.954 --> 34:30.554
Now you are about to be the fiercest

34:30.554 --> 34:32.591
and most fabulous superhero on the block.

34:35.943 --> 34:37.663
Be safe out there.

34:38.496 --> 34:40.465
Promise, I will. See ya. Have a good one.

34:40.466 --> 34:41.533
Bye.

34:56.215 --> 34:57.882
What you got?

34:57.883 --> 35:00.185
I tracked down an old
girlfriend of Joey Toledo's,

35:00.186 --> 35:02.687
and then did some asking around.

35:02.688 --> 35:06.457
Turns out she's been seen with a
guy matching his description.

35:06.458 --> 35:09.361
But that's not enough to get
a surveillance warrant,

35:09.362 --> 35:13.998
so I will send you her
info, along with a photo.

35:13.999 --> 35:16.600
Thanks, Inspector.

35:16.601 --> 35:18.335
Don't make me regret this.

35:18.336 --> 35:19.772
I won't.

35:25.577 --> 35:27.979
Take the suit off, Jefferson.

35:27.980 --> 35:30.648
Don't you get it? You could kill
yourself wearing that suit.

35:30.649 --> 35:32.016
We already had this conversation.

35:32.017 --> 35:33.685
Look, just calm down.

35:33.686 --> 35:35.786
If Toledo is out there,
he'll be out there tomorrow

35:35.787 --> 35:38.222
and then the next day.
He has no reason to run.

35:38.223 --> 35:39.524
I can't take that risk.

35:39.525 --> 35:41.026
Give me the control module, Gambi.

35:42.460 --> 35:45.396
I found an issue with the capacitor
array. That's been the problem.

35:45.397 --> 35:47.232
Now just give me a day to fix it.

35:47.233 --> 35:50.100
I want Toledo, I'm gonna have Toledo,

35:50.101 --> 35:51.937
so give me the control module,

35:52.871 --> 35:54.740
or I'm gonna Black-Lightning your ass.

36:40.219 --> 36:45.691
Did you know that in Africa some people
believe that albinos are magical?

36:46.758 --> 36:50.361
These people will actually
kidnap random albino,

36:50.362 --> 36:53.230
cut 'em up, grind up his bones,

36:53.231 --> 36:56.769
and sell it as "magic" dust.

38:16.348 --> 38:19.483
Okay, listen, if you
wanna be a superhero,

38:19.484 --> 38:21.387
you can't be afraid of dead rats.

38:22.869 --> 38:23.919
_

39:28.253 --> 39:29.420
Do you know who I am?

39:29.421 --> 39:30.990
Please don't hurt me.

39:31.757 --> 39:33.090
Unlock your phone and give it to me.

39:33.091 --> 39:35.394
If you try to do anything else,

39:36.194 --> 39:38.563
if you try to contact anyone else,

39:38.564 --> 39:39.965
I will find you.

39:44.669 --> 39:46.605
Go.

39:49.307 --> 39:54.180
_

39:54.181 --> 39:56.269
_

40:26.612 --> 40:27.679
Where is Tobias?

40:37.022 --> 40:40.025
Where is Tobias?

40:42.861 --> 40:43.862
I'm not telling you nothing.

41:15.460 --> 41:17.096
He may not have killed you before,

41:17.830 --> 41:19.164
but the next time Tobias sees you,

41:20.165 --> 41:22.735
he's gonna finish you, and I'll bury you.

41:32.644 --> 41:34.680
You should have stayed away.

41:35.414 --> 41:37.349
You shouldn't have come back.
