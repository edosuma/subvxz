WEBVTT

00:05.665 --> 00:08.768
They want to bring over our
guests earlier than expected.

00:08.868 --> 00:10.736
She hasn't removed
the targets yet.

00:14.740 --> 00:16.342
They're sending agents

00:16.442 --> 00:17.610
to replace their counterparts.

00:17.710 --> 00:19.111
Tell me something

00:19.211 --> 00:20.380
about yourself.

00:20.480 --> 00:22.582
There's not much to know.

00:26.952 --> 00:28.688
You need to find
your friend from the lie exam.

00:28.788 --> 00:30.890
- Oh, Kaspar?
-He's the only person

00:30.990 --> 00:32.257
who knew we were on our way.

00:32.358 --> 00:34.460
I want to order
the lunch special.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.161
And I'd like it delivered.

00:36.261 --> 00:38.398
You can't keep me here
forever. Sooner or later,

00:38.498 --> 00:40.032
you're gonna
have to do something.

00:40.132 --> 00:42.034
I know it looks like
all the fingers point at me,

00:42.134 --> 00:44.036
but it's not me.

00:44.136 --> 00:45.538
It's Howard Silk.

00:47.072 --> 00:50.810
You willingly
let her deceive you.

00:50.910 --> 00:54.046
I didn't know she was married.
She's human.

00:54.146 --> 00:55.848
She made mistakes.

00:55.948 --> 00:58.551
She's a fucking fraud,
just like my wife.

00:58.651 --> 01:00.886
I guess we have
nothing left to say.

01:05.224 --> 01:07.259
*

01:27.480 --> 01:30.049
These fucking hospitals.

01:30.149 --> 01:34.420
Greet you with a smile,
but take a number, have a seat.

01:38.290 --> 01:40.560
What are you in for?

01:42.094 --> 01:44.063
My wife was in an accident.

01:44.163 --> 01:47.733
Is she... all right?

01:47.833 --> 01:49.268
I don't know.

01:49.368 --> 01:51.103
She's in surgery.

01:53.272 --> 01:56.075
I-I can't get
any information yet.

02:00.846 --> 02:03.115
I'm Andrei.

02:03.215 --> 02:05.117
Howard.

02:14.426 --> 02:17.830
It's so, uh... so normal here.

02:17.930 --> 02:19.632
You know?

02:22.635 --> 02:25.705
Your whole life
hangs in the balance.

02:25.805 --> 02:27.607
Hmm.

02:28.941 --> 02:32.545
Does bring life
into focus, though.

02:32.645 --> 02:35.080
What matters and what doesn't.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.786
What matters to me is her.

02:47.426 --> 02:49.595
*

03:16.956 --> 03:19.859
*

03:46.251 --> 03:48.220
*

04:16.448 --> 04:18.017
Yeah.

04:18.117 --> 04:19.852
- Are you at home?
- Yeah.

04:19.952 --> 04:21.386
Get out.
They're coming to you.

04:21.486 --> 04:22.955
-Who?
-Aldrich's men.

04:23.055 --> 04:25.190
Get over to my house.
I'll explain when I see you,

04:25.290 --> 04:26.926
but you need to leave.

04:34.433 --> 04:36.636
*

04:55.154 --> 04:57.589
*

05:20.545 --> 05:22.682
I want him found.

05:40.265 --> 05:42.835
I'm looking for
one of my lie exam men.

05:42.935 --> 05:45.938
Seems he's been
informing for you lately.

05:46.038 --> 05:49.308
Goes by the name of Kaspar.

05:49.408 --> 05:51.476
Sound familiar?

05:51.576 --> 05:53.412
Rings a bell.

05:53.512 --> 05:55.580
I couldn't find him at his flat.

05:55.681 --> 05:59.384
Thought you might know
where he disappeared to.

06:01.787 --> 06:05.190
How was your visit to Potsdam?

06:09.795 --> 06:12.798
Here's how
this is gonna play out.

06:12.898 --> 06:16.035
I either end your wretched
little life right now,

06:16.135 --> 06:18.303
or I bring you into Management
for you to answer

06:18.403 --> 06:20.605
for whatever the hell it is
you're caught up in,

06:20.706 --> 06:23.142
and they deal with you
accordingly.

06:23.242 --> 06:25.277
What's it gonna be?

06:36.255 --> 06:38.190
I don't know.

06:38.290 --> 06:41.093
Which would you prefer?

06:49.068 --> 06:50.469
Fuck you.

06:50.569 --> 06:53.505
Don't be so touchy, dear boy.

06:53.605 --> 06:56.842
Actually, I'm glad
you came to see me.

06:56.942 --> 06:59.078
You know, there's something
I wanted to ask you about.

06:59.178 --> 07:02.782
If this is how you want it
to end, go ahead.

07:02.882 --> 07:05.584
It involves that woman
in your life,

07:05.684 --> 07:09.288
and the man
you think is Howard Silk.

07:12.491 --> 07:13.959
Come now.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.661
Man of your intelligence
had to know the truth.

07:16.762 --> 07:19.865
That one is nothing
like his other.

07:19.965 --> 07:22.868
Too loyal to her.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.641
You did know.

07:29.741 --> 07:33.278
Why did you let it
go on so long?

07:35.247 --> 07:37.149
You were waiting?

07:38.683 --> 07:42.021
How romantic.

07:42.121 --> 07:45.757
You were hoping she would
come to you with the truth.

07:49.261 --> 07:53.265
Well, you might want to act on
this sooner rather than later.

07:53.365 --> 07:56.902
God knows what kind of
Howard Silk he might turn into

07:57.002 --> 07:58.904
the longer he hangs around.

07:59.004 --> 08:01.807
Good luck with Kaspar.

08:01.907 --> 08:04.543
Hope you get to him before I do.

09:13.312 --> 09:15.280
*

09:59.458 --> 10:00.960
Ja, hallo?

10:01.060 --> 10:02.794
Will you be joining us
for supper?

10:02.894 --> 10:05.497
Tea is oolong.

10:05.597 --> 10:07.466
We're out of green.

10:10.002 --> 10:11.603
Whose house?

10:11.703 --> 10:13.272
Roderick's.

10:13.372 --> 10:16.775
Make sure your people are there.

10:16.875 --> 10:20.012
I think they're watching me.

10:20.112 --> 10:22.014
Hold up your end of the promise.

10:28.287 --> 10:30.555
Tea is oolong.

10:30.655 --> 10:31.923
We're out of green.

10:32.024 --> 10:33.825
Whose house?

10:33.925 --> 10:35.560
Roderick's.

10:35.660 --> 10:38.030
Make sure
your people are there.

10:38.130 --> 10:39.798
I think they're watching me.

10:39.898 --> 10:41.866
What the hell is an oolong?

10:41.967 --> 10:43.402
-It's a tea.
-A tea?

10:43.502 --> 10:46.838
Maybe it's a crypt
for dead drops.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.673
Each type's a different address.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.709
We'll never crack that.

10:50.809 --> 10:52.511
It's not for dead drops.

10:52.611 --> 10:57.049
It's a crypt that
the old network used to use.

10:57.149 --> 10:59.484
"Tea" is time of day.
"Oolong" is 1100 hours.

10:59.584 --> 11:03.122
Right.
And "Roderick" is a subway exit.

11:03.222 --> 11:04.723
Fuck, I can't remember which.

11:04.823 --> 11:06.758
Potsdamer Platz.

11:06.858 --> 11:08.227
It's an exfiltration.

11:08.327 --> 11:11.563
Pope is gonna
help him disappear.

11:11.663 --> 11:14.333
Disappear or "disappear"?

11:14.433 --> 11:16.668
Clearly,
Pope's not comfortable with

11:16.768 --> 11:18.703
how much he knows.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.572
What do you think?

11:20.672 --> 11:23.642
Potsdamer Platz it is.

11:26.411 --> 11:28.913
But not him.

11:29.014 --> 11:30.915
This is Housekeeping business.

11:31.016 --> 11:33.752
I'm sick and tired
of having a tagalong.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.696
He's right.

11:44.796 --> 11:47.232
Wait here for us.

11:57.976 --> 12:00.145
*

12:26.871 --> 12:29.074
*

13:07.279 --> 13:09.248
*

14:55.754 --> 14:58.223
What do you think?

14:59.258 --> 15:01.025
It's nice.

15:01.125 --> 15:02.961
Try it on.

15:03.061 --> 15:05.730
-For me?
-Yeah. Would be fun.

15:05.830 --> 15:08.800
I pick out something for you,
you pick out something for me.

15:08.900 --> 15:11.436
Come on.
What do you like?

15:12.737 --> 15:14.539
I don't know.

15:14.639 --> 15:16.375
It doesn't have to be my style.

15:16.475 --> 15:18.477
That's the fun of it.

15:21.212 --> 15:22.714
I don't know.

15:25.016 --> 15:27.185
You're hopeless.

15:27.286 --> 15:29.721
It's like you grew up
on a different planet.

15:35.260 --> 15:37.262
Nadia?

15:40.965 --> 15:43.234
I don't understand.

15:43.335 --> 15:46.037
Is this some kind of an act?

15:46.137 --> 15:49.207
What happened to you?

15:49.308 --> 15:52.344
I'm not sure who you think I am.

15:54.279 --> 15:57.248
Are you fucking serious
right now?

16:03.555 --> 16:05.524
Fuck you.

16:05.624 --> 16:07.125
Really.

16:07.225 --> 16:09.294
Whatever this is, fuck you.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.400
What was that?

16:15.500 --> 16:17.436
I don't know her.

16:17.536 --> 16:19.971
Yeah, but she knew you.

16:23.675 --> 16:25.944
It's all right to have a past,

16:26.044 --> 16:29.013
but I think we should be honest
with each other about it.

16:31.082 --> 16:33.017
She was mistaken.

16:35.387 --> 16:37.522
I don't know her.

16:42.761 --> 16:45.630
*

16:59.478 --> 17:01.780
The next train arrives
at 10:58.

17:01.880 --> 17:03.815
That'll be him.

17:03.915 --> 17:05.650
Wait for it.

17:09.020 --> 17:10.422
As soon as we have Kaspar,

17:10.522 --> 17:13.191
we need to be fast
in getting him out of the open.

17:13.291 --> 17:15.960
I don't trust that Pope won't
try something desperate.

17:25.103 --> 17:27.972
I never said thank you...

17:28.072 --> 17:30.509
for helping yesterday.

17:33.445 --> 17:37.015
I know it's complicated
when it comes to him.

17:37.115 --> 17:41.820
Thank you for understanding
why I had to work with him.

17:55.934 --> 17:58.437
You can always trust me.

17:58.537 --> 18:00.739
You know that.

18:03.007 --> 18:05.610
I would always listen.

18:10.114 --> 18:12.050
I know.

18:21.860 --> 18:23.895
*

19:12.644 --> 19:14.913
*

19:38.169 --> 19:40.138
*

20:15.306 --> 20:17.008
There he is.

20:21.445 --> 20:23.081
Something's wrong.

20:25.550 --> 20:27.652
He knows.

20:27.752 --> 20:29.854
*

21:08.860 --> 21:10.962
Where?

21:19.437 --> 21:22.040
Kaspar.

21:40.024 --> 21:42.093
You good?

21:42.193 --> 21:43.361
Max is hurt.

21:43.461 --> 21:45.229
Go back.

21:48.232 --> 21:49.934
Why did you do that?

21:50.034 --> 21:51.736
I just saved your life.

21:51.836 --> 21:54.105
Kaspar, listen to me, these
people are not your friends.

21:55.674 --> 21:58.042
You have no idea!

21:58.142 --> 22:00.378
Come with us.

22:00.478 --> 22:02.346
I can keep you safe.
They won't.

22:03.848 --> 22:05.684
You don't understand.

22:05.784 --> 22:07.819
That was my only chance.

22:10.021 --> 22:12.256
You just took my only chance!

22:12.356 --> 22:13.457
I know what these people can do.

22:13.557 --> 22:16.127
You... you've seen it, too.

22:18.096 --> 22:19.831
Whatever they've offered you,

22:19.931 --> 22:23.067
you're more important
to them dead.

22:23.167 --> 22:24.703
Do you hear me?

22:24.803 --> 22:27.471
Whatever it is...

22:27.571 --> 22:29.841
I can help you.

22:57.501 --> 22:58.970
Your wife and kid home?

22:59.070 --> 23:00.038
No.

23:00.138 --> 23:01.505
How long have they been here?

23:01.605 --> 23:03.274
All night.

23:11.082 --> 23:13.451
What the hell happened, Peter?

23:13.551 --> 23:15.086
Aldrich came over last night,

23:15.186 --> 23:17.621
started asking questions
about you.

23:17.722 --> 23:19.357
It's pretty safe to say
that you're blown.

23:19.457 --> 23:21.659
Me-- I-I don't know
what he knows about me yet.

23:21.760 --> 23:23.928
Fuck.

23:24.028 --> 23:26.798
This could not happen
at a worse fucking time.

23:26.898 --> 23:29.968
Did you hear anything
from the Interface room?

23:30.068 --> 23:31.702
Yeah, three known operatives
have crossed

23:31.803 --> 23:33.938
in the last couple of days.

23:34.038 --> 23:36.607
At least one of their others
works in your office.

23:36.707 --> 23:38.642
They're placing people inside?

23:38.743 --> 23:41.179
I think it's time
we talked to your wife.

23:41.279 --> 23:42.881
Why?

23:42.981 --> 23:44.849
Peter, we're out of
options here.

23:44.949 --> 23:47.518
Something big is about to go
down, and she knows about it.

23:47.618 --> 23:48.619
No, no, no.
You were right, Howard.

23:48.719 --> 23:49.821
I-I need to keep
playing the game.

23:49.921 --> 23:52.356
There's no game, Peter.
It's game over.

23:52.456 --> 23:55.393
I mean, if I'm blown, we're...

23:55.493 --> 23:57.228
What the fuck...?

23:59.030 --> 24:01.866
Gun.

24:03.401 --> 24:05.136
Okay, okay.

24:05.236 --> 24:07.806
Take it easy.

24:14.012 --> 24:15.814
-You told Aldrich.
-He came to me.

24:15.914 --> 24:18.216
-I had to give him something.
-Right.

24:18.316 --> 24:19.851
Then you get me
out of the apartment

24:19.951 --> 24:21.619
so they don't capture me,
and now what?

24:21.719 --> 24:23.121
You're gonna kill me
in self-defense?

24:23.221 --> 24:24.823
And you think that's gonna
keep your secret safe?

24:24.923 --> 24:26.290
Peter, I-I got to tell you,
this is...

24:26.390 --> 24:27.992
-this is a bad fucking plan.
-Shut up!

24:28.092 --> 24:31.062
Listen, all right?
Take it easy.

24:31.162 --> 24:32.964
This doesn't buy you much time.

24:33.064 --> 24:35.466
Even Aldrich is gonna figure out
that I'm not the one responsible

24:35.566 --> 24:39.537
for five years of leaks
from your department.

24:39.637 --> 24:41.005
Okay? It's gonna
come back to you.

24:41.105 --> 24:42.506
Yeah, well, I've got time
to figure that out.

24:42.606 --> 24:44.542
We got time right now...

24:44.642 --> 24:46.377
You don't have any fucking time!

24:50.614 --> 24:53.217
Big fucking mistake.

25:00.791 --> 25:02.593
How long have you been

25:02.693 --> 25:04.328
working for Pope?

25:07.731 --> 25:10.434
How long?

25:10.534 --> 25:13.537
Three years now.

25:13.637 --> 25:16.674
He wanted to know
vulnerabilities

25:16.774 --> 25:19.177
of certain people
within the Office.

25:19.277 --> 25:21.812
Could they be coerced and how.

25:21.913 --> 25:23.381
And you shared recordings?

25:23.481 --> 25:25.383
Sometimes.

25:27.986 --> 25:30.488
-Damn it.
-Help us, Kaspar.

25:30.588 --> 25:32.656
We need to understand
what these people are

25:32.756 --> 25:34.692
preparing to do.

25:34.792 --> 25:36.127
Why would they share
anything with me?

25:36.227 --> 25:37.628
The School.

25:37.728 --> 25:38.863
All those kids
they were teaching.

25:38.963 --> 25:40.598
That is years of legwork.

25:40.698 --> 25:42.400
You must have heard something.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.735
What is this?

25:44.835 --> 25:47.205
Is this your fucking
blood money?

25:47.305 --> 25:50.408
Uh, look, just... be careful.

25:50.508 --> 25:52.010
Fuck you!

25:52.110 --> 25:54.312
Those children died
because you made

25:54.412 --> 25:57.281
-a fucking phone call!
-No, no, no! No, no!

26:03.221 --> 26:06.224
What the hell?

26:08.659 --> 26:11.195
You're a sad kind of bastard.

26:16.334 --> 26:17.936
*

26:26.077 --> 26:28.512
Is this your child?

26:31.315 --> 26:33.351
Yes.

26:33.451 --> 26:35.086
My son.

26:36.420 --> 26:38.222
How old?

26:38.322 --> 26:40.925
Ten.

26:45.796 --> 26:48.166
He would have been ten.

26:53.037 --> 26:55.273
Alexander Pope bribed you

26:55.373 --> 26:58.376
with safe passage;
is that what went on?

27:00.011 --> 27:02.346
Some kind of switch out?

27:02.446 --> 27:05.349
He promised you
you could visit the other side

27:05.449 --> 27:06.817
and see your...

27:06.917 --> 27:09.520
living son?

27:14.258 --> 27:16.694
I can't protect you, Kaspar,

27:16.794 --> 27:19.363
if you don't tell me
who they are.

27:19.463 --> 27:22.700
Protect me?

27:22.800 --> 27:23.834
Don't you understand
what they do

27:23.934 --> 27:25.269
to anyone who gets in their way?

27:25.369 --> 27:28.206
The other you--
she tried, you know?

27:28.306 --> 27:30.541
Reached out to one of ours,
months ago.

27:30.641 --> 27:32.576
A warning
that people were coming over.

27:32.676 --> 27:35.579
I took it to Pope.
You know what he did?

27:35.679 --> 27:38.582
Had her run down, car accident.

27:38.682 --> 27:40.651
That's how far his reach goes!

27:40.751 --> 27:42.320
That accident-- that was Pope?!

27:42.420 --> 27:45.023
That's why she's in
the hospital? Pope and you?!

27:45.123 --> 27:47.258
You trade human lives
for some false hope

27:47.358 --> 27:49.093
of a second chance?!
What...?

27:49.193 --> 27:51.062
That is not your world
over there!

27:51.162 --> 27:53.397
That little boy over there
is not yours!

27:53.497 --> 27:55.633
- Do you understand?!
- Howard, stop!

28:08.012 --> 28:10.381
I'll tell you
who's been working for him.

28:12.783 --> 28:15.219
Everyone I know.

28:24.662 --> 28:26.397
What happened?

28:26.497 --> 28:28.332
What do you think happened?
He broke into my fucking house

28:28.432 --> 28:30.234
while your men were
supposed to be watching.

28:30.334 --> 28:33.171
And you said, last night,
if I give you the name,

28:33.271 --> 28:36.040
you would protect me.

28:48.419 --> 28:50.388
Okay.

28:53.424 --> 28:54.958
Aldrich.

28:55.059 --> 28:57.895
Find him.

28:57.995 --> 28:59.530
Do whatever you have to do.

29:05.503 --> 29:07.471
*

29:28.592 --> 29:29.927
Yeah?

29:30.027 --> 29:31.229
Anything at the house?

29:31.329 --> 29:33.797
Nothing. He swept it clean.

29:33.897 --> 29:35.366
What happened over there?

29:35.466 --> 29:37.201
He came to Quayle, but got away.

29:37.301 --> 29:38.802
This is bullshit, Aldrich.

29:38.902 --> 29:40.738
Quayle's not telling us
something. Let's bring him in.

29:40.838 --> 29:41.839
Not yet.

29:41.939 --> 29:44.175
Silk can't possibly be Shadow.

29:44.275 --> 29:45.809
Neither is Quayle.

29:45.909 --> 29:47.245
There's someone else
he's protecting.

29:47.345 --> 29:49.647
I think Howard Silk
knows who it is.

29:49.747 --> 29:51.649
Find him.

30:11.535 --> 30:13.404
Thought I told you
to keep her quiet.

30:13.504 --> 30:15.139
How am I expected
to do anything?

30:15.239 --> 30:18.242
I can't even pick her up.

30:25.849 --> 30:28.319
Peter, please.

30:44.235 --> 30:45.736
This is really bad.

30:45.836 --> 30:48.839
You know that, right?

30:50.474 --> 30:52.643
He can't be allowed
out there like this.

30:52.743 --> 30:55.012
If they catch him,
and with his last dying breath,

30:55.112 --> 30:56.980
he says my name, we're done.

30:57.080 --> 30:58.349
What the...?

31:00.117 --> 31:02.353
-Peter, for fuck's sake!
-Listen to me.

31:02.453 --> 31:06.156
All right, he told me that three
people have just come over.

31:06.257 --> 31:07.925
And you know about this?

31:08.025 --> 31:09.327
From where?

31:09.427 --> 31:13.197
From your fucking side, Clare.

31:15.132 --> 31:16.500
Of course you know about it.

31:16.600 --> 31:17.835
You arranged their passage,
didn't you?

31:17.935 --> 31:19.703
You know, you know exactly
what they're gonna do.

31:19.803 --> 31:22.373
If you're complicit in this,
your life will be in danger.

31:22.473 --> 31:25.576
Clare, what the fuck do you
think is happening right now?

31:27.911 --> 31:31.815
I know someone who can
take care of Howard Silk for us.

31:31.915 --> 31:34.352
Baldwin, my assassin.

31:37.688 --> 31:39.390
No, no.

31:39.490 --> 31:41.592
Peter, please. Stop!

31:41.692 --> 31:43.594
Fuck!

31:51.702 --> 31:54.338
Howard, what are you doing?

31:54.438 --> 31:56.307
You're gonna do me a favor.

31:57.441 --> 31:59.510
You might not see me again.

32:01.712 --> 32:05.549
Gonna keep this up here;
you're not gonna look at it.

32:05.649 --> 32:07.285
You're gonna give it
back to Emily

32:07.385 --> 32:09.453
when she comes out
of the hospital.

32:09.553 --> 32:11.489
Does this make me
some kind of accessory?

32:11.589 --> 32:13.557
It makes you a man
who's doing the right thing

32:13.657 --> 32:16.360
instead of fucking
another man's wife.

32:18.662 --> 32:20.097
Why trust me?

32:24.468 --> 32:27.170
Only because she did.

32:27.271 --> 32:29.273
Howard?

32:31.208 --> 32:33.877
She never would've left you.

32:33.977 --> 32:36.847
I asked her once, she said no.

32:36.947 --> 32:39.650
I wanted you to know that.

32:43.754 --> 32:46.390
I don't know why I let this
friendship go on like it did.

32:46.490 --> 32:49.360
The Go game,
the bullshit charade.

32:49.460 --> 32:51.862
Maybe it was disingenuous.

32:54.698 --> 32:57.635
I just saw you
in that waiting room,

32:57.735 --> 33:00.404
and you looked like the
loneliest man I'd ever seen.

33:02.306 --> 33:04.575
And I felt bad for you.

33:08.679 --> 33:13.016
Whatever this is,
you're not alone, you know that.

33:40.243 --> 33:42.780
Where the fuck have you been?

33:42.880 --> 33:44.782
Tell me you've eliminated
the targets.

33:44.882 --> 33:47.050
All but the woman
in the hospital.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.952
She's still guarded.

33:49.052 --> 33:50.521
Go back to her later.

33:50.621 --> 33:52.189
There's something else
I need you to do.

33:52.289 --> 33:55.325
I'll find you the money.

33:55.426 --> 33:56.994
I'll pay you double.

33:57.094 --> 34:00.464
But Howard Silk--
the one here is from our side.

34:00.564 --> 34:02.733
He needs to be eliminated.

34:06.504 --> 34:10.408
Another hundred thousand
for Silk and his wife.

34:11.509 --> 34:13.844
I'll get it for you.

34:15.245 --> 34:17.681
I'll be in touch.

34:40.971 --> 34:42.272
Hello.

34:42.372 --> 34:44.107
Triple bypass surgery.

34:44.207 --> 34:45.609
Wh-What?

34:45.709 --> 34:47.711
Only time I've missed work
in the last ten years.

34:47.811 --> 34:49.547
Please tell me
that you're forwarding

34:49.647 --> 34:51.314
your calls to your death bed,

34:51.415 --> 34:53.851
and that's why
you're not at work today.

34:53.951 --> 34:56.086
No, it's, uh...
it's just this f-flu.

34:57.655 --> 34:59.557
I-I don't want
to spread it around.

34:59.657 --> 35:01.459
Upstairs wants a joint briefig

35:01.559 --> 35:04.662
on that deal that went to shit.

35:04.762 --> 35:07.297
Can we... can we reschedule?

35:07.397 --> 35:08.766
With the Fourth Floor?

35:12.235 --> 35:14.738
I can't. I'm sorry.

35:14.838 --> 35:18.476
Peter, I don't know what's
been going on with you lately.

35:18.576 --> 35:20.778
That little show
you put on the other night?

35:20.878 --> 35:22.580
I get it. Marriage isn't
perfect, I understand that.

35:22.680 --> 35:24.381
But do yourself a favor.

35:24.482 --> 35:27.084
Get your life in order
and get your ass in here.

35:27.184 --> 35:28.919
Yes, sir.

35:29.019 --> 35:30.954
Good choice.

35:36.259 --> 35:39.296
Children, you know?

35:39.396 --> 35:41.765
Can you take this
down the hall, please?

35:43.667 --> 35:45.769
-Right away.
-Thank you.

35:52.676 --> 35:54.545
What are you doing?

35:54.645 --> 35:57.314
Going to work.

35:57.414 --> 35:58.616
Peter, wait.

35:58.716 --> 36:00.017
This is what I do.

36:00.117 --> 36:03.286
Your father calls, I answer.

36:03.386 --> 36:05.523
Not today.

36:10.160 --> 36:12.029
I can't tell you why.

36:12.129 --> 36:14.898
Please, just...

36:14.998 --> 36:17.868
don't go in today.

36:33.383 --> 36:35.185
No.

36:41.191 --> 36:43.160
*

36:55.305 --> 36:58.008
What am I to you?

36:59.643 --> 37:01.745
Am I a mark?

37:01.845 --> 37:04.915
Or am I actually your husband?

37:05.015 --> 37:08.719
Just... just make up
your fucking mind.

37:18.495 --> 37:22.032
When I first met you,
I despised you.

37:22.132 --> 37:24.234
The other girls,

37:24.334 --> 37:27.938
the lying, bullshit wedding.

37:32.209 --> 37:34.745
But I went through with it.

37:34.845 --> 37:36.814
'Cause that's what I do.

37:38.716 --> 37:40.483
I spent my whole life

37:40.584 --> 37:43.286
becoming this perfect version
of someone else.

37:45.623 --> 37:48.325
The stupid girl
they wanted me to be.

37:55.098 --> 37:57.668
I've never had anything
of my own.

38:00.671 --> 38:02.773
Until she was born.

38:05.508 --> 38:08.511
Spencer was mine.

38:08.612 --> 38:11.849
Not hers or theirs.

38:13.784 --> 38:15.518
For the first time in my life,

38:15.619 --> 38:18.321
I had something
that belonged to only me.

38:30.033 --> 38:32.970
Peter, I know our marriage has
been one giant, fucked-up sham,

38:33.070 --> 38:37.007
but... you're the only one
who knows me.

38:39.209 --> 38:41.611
Both sides of who I am.

38:59.663 --> 39:02.465
Days like these
I always forget to eat.

39:02.565 --> 39:05.002
No, thank you.

39:05.102 --> 39:08.538
My Emily always has gummy beas

39:08.638 --> 39:09.973
in her purse.

39:10.073 --> 39:13.076
Otherwise, she can get a bit...

39:13.176 --> 39:15.445
Lightheaded.

39:15.545 --> 39:18.816
Well, I was gonna say...
temperamental.

39:22.820 --> 39:25.422
So strange. I look at you,
and I see a woman

39:25.522 --> 39:27.925
that I've loved for 30 years.

39:31.628 --> 39:34.231
I think about everything
that we've shared.

39:34.331 --> 39:37.234
Thanksgivings...

39:37.334 --> 39:40.370
jokes, fights.

39:40.470 --> 39:43.240
All of it.

39:43.340 --> 39:45.642
Then I realize...

39:45.743 --> 39:47.745
you're not a part of that.

39:49.612 --> 39:51.749
I don't know you.

39:55.352 --> 39:57.788
What are we doing?

40:01.624 --> 40:03.761
I don't know.

40:07.164 --> 40:09.199
*

40:17.440 --> 40:19.342
I can't be here anymore.

40:19.442 --> 40:21.344
Where are you going?

40:23.546 --> 40:25.482
I'm sorry. I...

40:27.550 --> 40:29.486
I miss my wife.

40:31.488 --> 40:33.290
I need to go home.

40:48.505 --> 40:50.507
*

41:20.603 --> 41:21.771
Peter, what is this?

41:21.872 --> 41:23.373
We're going for a drive.

41:23.473 --> 41:24.942
They have eyes on us.

41:25.042 --> 41:26.376
I don't give a fuck.

41:26.476 --> 41:27.777
Where's Spencer?

41:27.878 --> 41:29.947
Your mother picked her up.

41:47.264 --> 41:49.266
*

42:05.782 --> 42:08.385
Are you turning me in?

42:26.636 --> 42:28.438
You're gonna get us killed
before we even get there.

42:28.538 --> 42:30.440
I don't even know
what to say anymore, Clare.

42:30.540 --> 42:34.177
-Stop this!
-I've been such a fucking fool.

42:38.481 --> 42:40.283
I'm so sorry, Peter.

42:40.383 --> 42:42.619
Maybe a part of me
does love you.

42:44.554 --> 42:46.456
The part of you that I know.

42:46.556 --> 42:48.258
Yeah, but that's the problem,
isn't it?

42:48.358 --> 42:51.694
We only see the parts of people
that we want to see.

42:54.797 --> 42:57.467
I'm such a fucking coward.

43:11.648 --> 43:13.483
Peter.

43:13.583 --> 43:15.285
Okay.

43:15.385 --> 43:18.288
All right, Peter,
time for some bravery.

43:18.388 --> 43:21.891
First time
in your fucking life.

43:21.992 --> 43:22.892
Peter, what are you doing?

43:59.229 --> 44:01.198
*

44:12.009 --> 44:14.644
He's here.

44:23.720 --> 44:25.622
Good. You came to us.

45:34.324 --> 45:36.293
Please tell me
that you know this is not me.

45:36.393 --> 45:37.894
You can't be
that fucking stupid.

45:37.994 --> 45:39.562
It's Quayle's wife.

45:39.662 --> 45:41.598
She's the mole,
and she's not alone.

45:41.698 --> 45:44.033
You got to check every employee
in this building.

45:44.134 --> 45:46.403
You have multiple points
of compromise.

45:54.511 --> 45:56.479

46:21.638 --> 46:23.740
*

46:35.352 --> 46:36.886
Oh, my God.

46:36.986 --> 46:39.689
Is she all right?

46:39.789 --> 46:42.992
What hospital?

46:43.092 --> 46:45.762
All right.
I'll be right there.

46:45.862 --> 46:48.631
Helen!

46:48.731 --> 46:50.700
Helen! I need my car...

47:33.876 --> 47:34.777
Aldrich...

47:34.877 --> 47:36.078
God...

47:36.179 --> 47:37.780
Fuck!

48:44.614 --> 48:46.749
They're trying
to get downstairs.

49:32.529 --> 49:35.565
Please. Please help me.

49:35.665 --> 49:36.633
Help me.

50:21.277 --> 50:23.846
*

50:48.037 --> 50:49.472
Should we get him?

50:49.572 --> 50:51.374
No. We can't touch him now.

50:51.474 --> 50:53.510
He's on the border.
