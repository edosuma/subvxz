You can tell
by the pointy ears...

21:17.943 --> 21:19.486
Zip it or I'll bite you.

21:20.570 --> 21:22.447
Hey, snake. Eat this.

21:23.615 --> 21:25.951
(SNAKE HISSING)

21:25.951 --> 21:27.619
EMMA: It worked. Kids, hurry.

21:29.037 --> 21:32.332
(SNAKE HISSING)

21:33.083 --> 21:34.167
Is everyone okay?

21:34.167 --> 21:35.585
Yes.
Thank you.

21:35.585 --> 21:36.920
I need a change of pants.

21:39.381 --> 21:41.508
Wait. Why are you
both covered in paint?

21:41.967 --> 21:43.468
I thought that was
just a Zuri thing.

21:43.885 --> 21:46.430
It was, but seeing
how stupid Emma looked

21:46.430 --> 21:49.933
made me realize
internet fame isn't worth
getting lead poisoning.

21:50.976 --> 21:52.436
What? This is lead paint?

21:52.436 --> 21:53.603
Just kidding.

21:54.229 --> 21:55.230
Very funny.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.358
But, thank you
for sacrificing
your phone in there.

21:58.775 --> 21:59.985
That must have been
really hard for you.

22:00.652 --> 22:02.988
Eh, I was probably
on the phone too much.

22:03.405 --> 22:05.032
I was starting
to dream in emoji.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.410
I should have never
given back everyone's phones.

22:09.119 --> 22:10.787
Camp should be about
having fun in real life.

22:11.038 --> 22:12.998
Not being obsessed
with what's on some screen.

22:13.290 --> 22:14.458
Yeah.

22:14.458 --> 22:17.419
These dumb phones
almost ended our friendship.

22:18.086 --> 22:21.882
And your
"Let's work it out in an
abandoned train car" idea

22:21.882 --> 22:23.383
almost ended our lives.

22:23.967 --> 22:26.011
So, next time
we have a problem,

22:26.011 --> 22:27.345
let's work it out
in the mess hall.

22:27.637 --> 22:29.389
Or the abandoned
nuclear power plant.

22:30.599 --> 22:33.185
I can't believe we were
fighting over this guy.

22:36.021 --> 22:39.274
So, from now on,
phones are rebanned
at Camp Kikiwaka.

22:39.274 --> 22:41.068
(ALL CHEERING)

22:41.735 --> 22:43.987
Good thing, because we were
all out of control.

22:43.987 --> 22:45.489
Ravi almost got krilled.

22:46.448 --> 22:47.908
You have no idea.

22:47.908 --> 22:50.327
The nurse had to perform
an emergency squidectomy.

22:50.660 --> 22:52.496
She said I'll be
squirting ink for weeks.

22:53.371 --> 22:55.373
Oh. (LAUGHS)
Been there.

22:55.832 --> 22:57.584
My advice is to walk slowly

22:57.584 --> 22:58.877
and wear black underwear.

23:00.003 --> 23:02.339
You got a lot of nerve
showing up here.

23:02.339 --> 23:04.966
Why don't you go
hang out with your
sous sushi chef, Sue?

23:05.217 --> 23:06.510
Nah, she quit.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.428
Sue now sells
sea shells by the sea shore.

23:09.888 --> 23:12.474
Besides, I just came by
to congratulate you.

23:12.808 --> 23:14.851
Your seafood tower post
went viral.

23:15.102 --> 23:17.020
It whipped
my Butter Murphy's butt.

23:21.399 --> 23:23.026
Ravi, we're famous!

23:23.443 --> 23:24.945
We gotta make another video.

23:24.945 --> 23:25.946
Quick, hurt yourself.

23:27.823 --> 23:28.824
Here we go again.

23:29.157 --> 23:30.242
Don't worry, Emma,

23:30.242 --> 23:30.992
I got this.

23:32.285 --> 23:33.286
(PHONE CRACKING)

23:34.371 --> 23:35.497
Hey!

23:35.497 --> 23:37.207
I just bought that phone.

23:37.207 --> 23:38.416
Oh, sorry.

23:38.416 --> 23:39.501
You can borrow mine.

23:39.918 --> 23:42.045
It has a really cute
snakeskin case.

23:44.381 --> 23:45.549
(EXCLAIMS)

23:45.549 --> 23:46.550
(PHONE RINGING)

23:48.301 --> 23:49.386
I'm not answering that.
