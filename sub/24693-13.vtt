It's gonna be like this
every night from now on, Avery.

02:06.373 --> 02:09.136
Check it out.
We're Mr. and Mrs. Woodley now.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.886
Woody, did you make these?

02:15.830 --> 02:17.032
It's Roy.

02:24.366 --> 02:25.751
Why are you stopping?

02:26.732 --> 02:28.356
Did you take all your jewelry?

02:28.874 --> 02:30.328
Come on, give it to me.

02:30.538 --> 02:32.482
Come on. And your rings.

02:37.868 --> 02:39.625
Wait. You're leaving me here?

02:39.625 --> 02:41.471
I'll be right back.

03:15.316 --> 03:17.286
Woody? It's 2:00 am.

03:17.802 --> 03:21.104
Just woke up on the couch.
Where are you?

03:25.669 --> 03:29.171
Bank robbers, serial killers,
and sociopaths...

03:29.171 --> 03:30.576
We love them all.

03:32.324 --> 03:37.792
Kathy Jarrow brings them to life
as America's foremost true crime writer.

03:38.155 --> 03:40.890
And thanks GOD those books sell.

03:40.890 --> 03:47.386
Because that's how Kathy could donate
$2 million to our police academy.

03:47.386 --> 03:50.832
Our honored guest, Kathy Jarrow.

04:00.925 --> 04:04.874
Solving the mystery of a crime is, uh...
is hard.

04:06.453 --> 04:08.555
But the mysteries of...

04:08.897 --> 04:10.947
home and heart...

04:27.100 --> 04:28.456
I'm sorry.

04:29.938 --> 04:31.918
I can't find my husband.

05:17.096 --> 05:20.778

05:27.299 --> 05:29.617
A missing husband case?

05:29.617 --> 05:31.282
You need both of us on this?

05:31.282 --> 05:33.691
Kathy's a friend of NYPD and mine.

05:33.691 --> 05:36.537
She thinks something serious happened.
I trust her instincts.

05:36.537 --> 05:40.892
So she's a... a good friend.

05:40.892 --> 05:43.742
That's not your business,
and that's not what this is about.

05:43.944 --> 05:47.092
Before Kathy started writing about crime.
She was a cop.

05:47.784 --> 05:49.511
She knows the drill.

05:57.117 --> 05:59.972
Detectives. Kathy Jarrow.

06:01.465 --> 06:03.594
Sorry to pull you in so late.

06:04.527 --> 06:05.721
It's okay.

06:06.424 --> 06:09.894
So, uh, the last time I saw my husband
was Thursday morning.

06:09.894 --> 06:12.182
There was nothing odd about his behavior.

06:12.745 --> 06:14.469
And before then?

06:14.948 --> 06:17.400
This is him. Woody Sage.

06:17.400 --> 06:21.680
He called my cell on Thursday around 5:00
to say he'd picked up some extra sessions,

06:21.680 --> 06:25.140
- he'd be at work till 10:00.
- Sessions?

06:25.680 --> 06:26.980
So what does he do?

06:26.980 --> 06:28.678
He's a personal trainer.

06:28.951 --> 06:31.458
And, yes, a much younger man.

06:32.121 --> 06:33.895
We met at the gym.

06:34.187 --> 06:35.656
He is 20...

06:35.656 --> 06:38.494
3. But an old soul.

06:39.081 --> 06:40.462
Where's his gym?

06:40.462 --> 06:41.921
Upper east side.

06:41.921 --> 06:45.516
He drives a 2008 Range Rover, white.

06:45.781 --> 06:47.196
Oh, that's...

06:47.564 --> 06:49.205
A nice car.

06:50.006 --> 06:51.017
It was a gift?

06:51.017 --> 06:53.097
Yes. For our second anniversary.

06:53.097 --> 06:56.394
Lucky guy, 2008.
That has a GPS?

06:57.050 --> 06:59.721
There have been a string
of SUV jacking lately.

06:59.721 --> 07:02.289
The upper Westside, Hell's kitchen.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.256
Oh.

07:06.241 --> 07:09.833
We'll put out an all-points,
see if we can track his GPS.

07:09.833 --> 07:11.289
Okay, thanks.

07:12.117 --> 07:13.644
Thank you, detectives.

07:19.681 --> 07:21.516
They seem a little out of SYNC.

07:21.516 --> 07:24.133
He's coming off suspension.
They're working it out.

07:27.553 --> 07:31.804
Look at you.
Captain Ross of Major Case.

07:38.876 --> 07:42.383
It's late.
I'll have a detective drive you home.

07:42.383 --> 07:44.335
These car jacking, Danny...

07:45.052 --> 07:46.910
What happened to the drivers?

07:48.868 --> 07:50.762
We'll find Woody.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.168
Don't worry.

07:55.616 --> 07:59.453
So no calls from Woody's cell phone
since Thursday afternoon.

07:59.453 --> 08:04.879
But lots of calls from Kathy to his cell
starting at 2:00 am.

08:05.456 --> 08:06.809
She was up all night.

08:06.809 --> 08:09.993
Even when she's in trouble,
Kathy can't ask a favor.

08:09.993 --> 08:12.379
- His Rover turn up?
- Uh, nothing yet.

08:12.379 --> 08:15.396
We've sent teams to chop shops, ports.

08:15.396 --> 08:16.929
And Woody's GPS?

08:16.929 --> 08:20.952
Well, these are his movements
from Thursday morning till 10:00 pm

08:20.952 --> 08:23.072
when his GPS was shut off.

08:23.072 --> 08:26.965
He leaves Tribeca at 10:00 am,
drives to his gym,

08:26.965 --> 08:32.219
parks there for even hours,
then heads to Hell's Kitchen at 5:00.

08:32.219 --> 08:38.207
And then his car detours from there
to the South Bronx.

08:38.448 --> 08:40.397
"Bonfire of the vanities" territory.

08:40.397 --> 08:43.212
Where he makes three stops.

08:43.613 --> 08:45.902
Two on St. Ann's Avenue,

08:45.902 --> 08:50.467
and then at 9:00, he drives out of range
until he stops here.

08:50.467 --> 08:52.842
In this industrial wasteland...

08:52.842 --> 08:56.407
past the Bruckner, off Locust Avenue.

09:02.716 --> 09:05.482
No way Woody drove here on his own.

09:08.611 --> 09:12.153
Broken... taillight.
There's glass everywhere.

09:12.153 --> 09:14.493
Maybe from a car window?

09:14.493 --> 09:18.422
Or a hundred car windows.
It's a chop shop transfer station.

09:39.232 --> 09:40.918
"Woodystoy."

09:43.581 --> 09:45.963
So Woody was jacked in the city.

09:47.704 --> 09:51.212
They drove his Rover up here.
Switched out the plates.

09:52.058 --> 09:53.872
It's a tough trails to follow.

09:53.872 --> 09:57.209
Well, then... let's go backward.

09:58.119 --> 10:02.639
Woody's car made two stops
in the South Bronx that night.

10:02.639 --> 10:05.965
Brand-new white Rover
on St. Ann's avenue.

10:05.965 --> 10:07.953
Somebody might remember that.

10:13.983 --> 10:17.323
White Rover with a white driver.
Hard to say. Man.

10:17.323 --> 10:18.622
Hard to say.

10:19.211 --> 10:21.581
There's cat food here.
You got a cat?

10:21.581 --> 10:23.201
Better than rats.

10:23.201 --> 10:26.337
Yeah. Not according
to the health department. Eames.

10:26.337 --> 10:28.871
We have multiple violation here.

10:31.802 --> 10:34.146
NYPD has nothing better to do. Right?

10:34.146 --> 10:36.672
Not today.
How about you?

10:38.911 --> 10:41.006
Maybe I saw the driver dude.

10:41.006 --> 10:43.644
Disappear into that storefront
across the street.

10:46.416 --> 10:48.848
- Looks abandoned.
- They work odd hours.

10:48.848 --> 10:53.526
So this guy just leaving his new white SUV
in this neighborhood.

10:54.414 --> 10:55.633
Drugs?

10:55.906 --> 10:57.479
More like a local eBay.

10:57.479 --> 10:59.701
And he left his hoochita on guard inside.

10:59.701 --> 11:02.026
He and a woman with him.
Someone from the neighborhood?

11:02.026 --> 11:05.009
Yeah, from the block.
Where all the rich, white cover girls live.

11:05.386 --> 11:09.381
I walk out with the garbage,
smile... she freaks.

11:09.381 --> 11:10.831
Honks the horn till he comes back.

11:10.831 --> 11:13.910
And then they drove off together.
Anyone else in the car?

11:13.910 --> 11:15.647
There would have been a crowd.

11:20.029 --> 11:23.140
Place is empty.
Must be appointment only.

11:23.140 --> 11:26.284
CSU found empty watch boxes and this.

11:26.284 --> 11:27.552
Jeweler's loupe.

11:27.552 --> 11:32.571
So this devoted husband
picks up a hottie in Hell's Kitchen.

11:32.571 --> 11:34.163
Drives up here.

11:34.163 --> 11:37.441
Pawns some jewelry
and then gets carjacked.

11:38.350 --> 11:39.975
Maybe or...

11:39.975 --> 11:43.712
Or maybe Woody just ran off
with this other woman.

11:43.712 --> 11:46.580
And the carjacking is his cover story.

11:47.703 --> 11:49.312
Should we tell the Captain?

11:49.312 --> 11:51.395
Let's confirm it first.

11:51.395 --> 11:53.312
You're exactly right, Eames.

11:54.199 --> 11:57.513
No. I'm just saying, you know...
You're right.

12:03.307 --> 12:05.411
Woody's not on the schedule next week.

12:05.411 --> 12:07.195
He picks and chooses when he works.

12:07.195 --> 12:08.692
His clients don't mind?

12:08.692 --> 12:10.629
Let me guess... mostly women?

12:10.629 --> 12:13.119
He's popular.
But he keeps it professional.

12:13.874 --> 12:15.893
Didn't he meet his wife here?

12:16.381 --> 12:18.402
Oh, he and Avery aren't married.

12:18.402 --> 12:20.585
She still lives with her husband Roy.

12:22.326 --> 12:24.503
Um... can you not do that?

12:28.510 --> 12:31.716
Yeah. So, uh, Avery's a client here?

12:31.716 --> 12:34.753
Massage therapist.
So-so.

12:34.963 --> 12:37.491
She and Woody are seeing each other?

12:37.491 --> 12:38.800
Since last summer.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.294
She cancelled all her appointments too?

12:41.294 --> 12:42.984
Avery lives in Hell's kitchen?

12:42.984 --> 12:46.255
Mm-hmm. Woody drives her
home every night.

12:46.255 --> 12:48.121
Roy doesn't have a clue.

12:48.515 --> 12:50.153
Thank you very much.

12:51.598 --> 12:53.284
That's Avery Hubert.

12:55.250 --> 12:58.756
The hoochita from the Range Rover?
Looks Woody's age.

12:58.756 --> 13:02.668
Maybe his old soul wanted a younger body.

13:02.668 --> 13:06.373
CSU. Only one set of prints
on the license plate...

13:06.373 --> 13:08.102
Woody's.

13:08.102 --> 13:10.182
Looks like they set the whole thing up.

13:29.449 --> 13:30.966
Ladies.

13:31.755 --> 13:33.278
Bartender.

13:33.507 --> 13:36.066
Whatever they want.

13:36.747 --> 13:41.169
Girls... I'm Roy.

13:52.339 --> 13:53.832
The cash's gone.

13:55.449 --> 13:58.344
Our go-bag.
In case of another attack.

13:59.294 --> 14:02.346
- How much was in there?
- 5,000.

14:03.484 --> 14:07.090
He's smart.
He took what I wouldn't miss

14:07.090 --> 14:09.082
and ran off with Avery.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.781
How humiliating.

14:11.323 --> 14:12.802
You know her.

14:13.905 --> 14:17.271
Woody recommended her
when I went in for a massage last year.

14:17.271 --> 14:18.856
She's a little ditz.

14:19.289 --> 14:21.057
He sent you to her?

14:24.449 --> 14:25.815
Sorry.

14:27.180 --> 14:29.099
Did you suspect anything?

14:30.349 --> 14:33.852
Last summer, Woody seemed detached.

14:34.448 --> 14:37.267
But then we decided to have a baby, so...

14:39.067 --> 14:41.143
That room... it's a nursery.

14:41.143 --> 14:44.375
We were scheduled for
in vitro Friday morning.

14:44.375 --> 14:46.240
I was at the clinic.

14:47.489 --> 14:51.595
Why... would he stage a carjacking?

14:51.990 --> 14:54.414
Kathy, you're an ex-cop
with friends on the job.

14:54.414 --> 14:57.182
Maybe they wanted to give
themselves a head start.

14:57.528 --> 14:59.681
What did he think I would do?

15:03.726 --> 15:06.118
Tell your detectives I'm sorry.

15:06.454 --> 15:09.271
They're Major Case, not house dicks.

15:13.173 --> 15:15.630
I always get it wrong,
don't I, Danny?

15:16.544 --> 15:19.876
Chase the bad ones and
let the good ones get away.

15:30.957 --> 15:34.975
Thank you for your time. Detectives.
But we're done with Kathy's case.

15:36.155 --> 15:38.336
Oh. We're done.

15:38.336 --> 15:39.567
Captain. This, uh...

15:39.567 --> 15:44.737
Footage of Avery at the ATM
the night she went missing.

15:44.737 --> 15:47.023
I mean, something seems off.

15:47.023 --> 15:52.228
She's rubbing her mala beads there, and...
It's like a Buddhist rosary.

15:52.228 --> 15:54.042
I think she's praying.

15:54.042 --> 15:57.140
Yeah. Like, "Please, God.
Don't let us get caught."

15:57.140 --> 15:58.992
She does seem nervous.

15:58.992 --> 16:02.008
Maybe that's because she's a home wrecker
looting her husband's bank account

16:02.008 --> 16:04.642
while trying to pretend
she's being carjacked.

16:04.642 --> 16:06.050
It's a ruse.

16:06.680 --> 16:10.045
- Eames. Missing persons report.
- Thank you.

16:10.849 --> 16:12.160
Captain.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.268
Filed by Avery's parents.

16:16.268 --> 16:19.041
She and Woody were expected
in Maine on Friday.

16:19.041 --> 16:20.649
They never made it.

16:21.685 --> 16:24.589
Romeo and Juliet didn't tell their parents
where they were going either.

16:24.589 --> 16:28.433
Why haven't we heard
from Avery's husband yet?

16:30.442 --> 16:33.492
Okay. I'll follow up with the parents.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.726
You two track down Mr. Hubert.

16:38.489 --> 16:41.786
Avery's not missing.
She's uh, visiting her family in Maine.

16:42.428 --> 16:44.441
Without you. Huh?

16:44.441 --> 16:46.233
In-laws. I get that.

16:46.233 --> 16:48.472
Well. For a prize like Avery...

16:48.752 --> 16:50.077
Put up with anything.

16:50.077 --> 16:55.051
So you know about her... friendship
with the trainer at the gym?

16:55.963 --> 16:58.136
She seem unhappy to you?

16:58.136 --> 16:59.568
Unhappy?

16:59.912 --> 17:03.046
What. Do you think every college
dropout lives like this?

17:03.046 --> 17:05.502
So when was the last time
you heard from Avery?

17:05.502 --> 17:06.910
Thursday night.

17:06.910 --> 17:09.527
She left a message.
Said she was off to her parents'.

17:09.527 --> 17:11.060
So now it's Monday.

17:11.060 --> 17:13.549
And you haven't heard from her.
You must be worried.

17:13.549 --> 17:17.472
Haven't had time.
I had a business trip Friday morning.

17:17.714 --> 17:20.034
Ask my doorman.
What's all this about?

17:20.034 --> 17:23.402
Her parents filed a missing persons report.

17:23.402 --> 17:25.063
She never made it to Maine.

17:25.063 --> 17:28.053
But you know that.
Right, Roy?

17:29.880 --> 17:31.357
Hate to say it.

17:31.357 --> 17:33.496
But you know
what my partner's thinking. Roy?

17:33.496 --> 17:35.818
Roy doesn't care
what your partner's thinking.

17:35.818 --> 17:38.815
What I'm thinking is you know that Avery
never made it home

17:38.815 --> 17:41.507
because you did something to her.

17:44.338 --> 17:45.557
No...

17:47.531 --> 17:49.059
Look, pal...

17:50.778 --> 17:52.426
I lied.

17:53.655 --> 17:56.707
Avery's run off with that trainer.
You can check the message.

17:56.707 --> 18:00.939
Wow. Man. She dumped you on...
Your answering machine.

18:00.939 --> 18:03.597
I mean. That would... Man.
That would make me feel furious.

18:03.597 --> 18:06.218
What'd you do to your hand there?

18:06.554 --> 18:09.045
I did that punching her mirror.

18:09.045 --> 18:10.834
Where were you Thursday night?

18:10.834 --> 18:13.504
At work.
And I'm due back there now.

18:16.692 --> 18:18.899
Roy claimed that he was working late,

18:18.899 --> 18:20.863
but his key card scanned him out at 5:00.

18:20.863 --> 18:22.476
Hell of an alibi.

18:22.476 --> 18:26.532
Avery's parents said she was due to
arrive Friday for their wedding anniversary.

18:26.532 --> 18:28.016
With Woody.

18:28.016 --> 18:30.434
She was gonna bring her lover
to her parents' anniversary?

18:30.434 --> 18:33.364
Woody stayed with them before.
They think he's a sweetheart.

18:33.364 --> 18:35.276
They also think she's separated from Roy.

18:35.276 --> 18:37.648
- They seem happy about that?
- Very.

18:37.648 --> 18:40.847
Avery's mom said Roy's controlling.

18:40.847 --> 18:43.849
She'd always thought it was only
a matter of time before he'd blow.

18:43.849 --> 18:45.586
Well, he has, in the past.

18:45.586 --> 18:47.892
His first wife took out
a restraining order on him

18:47.892 --> 18:49.814
when they were getting divorced.

18:51.858 --> 18:55.977
Woody and Avery... nobody's heard
from these two in four days.

18:57.083 --> 18:59.259
The carjack...

19:00.087 --> 19:03.799
wasn't staged because they were
afraid Kathy would find them.

19:04.184 --> 19:07.898
They were afraid that
Roy would hunt them down.

19:10.508 --> 19:12.779
Turns out you left work Thursday night.

19:12.779 --> 19:14.130
That right?

19:14.479 --> 19:16.590
Then I must have been home alone.

19:16.590 --> 19:20.987
Your doorman told us
you came home after midnight.

19:23.537 --> 19:26.214
How'd you track Avery down. Roy?

19:26.214 --> 19:27.902
Track her down?

19:29.034 --> 19:30.752
What am I?

19:30.752 --> 19:33.252
Well, we know you're a wife beater.

19:33.252 --> 19:36.266
- Maybe a murderer.
- Maybe a murderer.

19:37.011 --> 19:40.078
No. I'm a lover.

19:40.078 --> 19:42.880
I was with my lady friend.

19:43.323 --> 19:44.815
You're having an affair too?

19:44.815 --> 19:48.153
Avery stepped out on me.
I stepped out on her.

19:48.875 --> 19:51.959
Guess everybody wants
what they can't have.

19:51.959 --> 19:53.317
Does she have a name?

19:53.317 --> 19:54.807
She does.

19:55.865 --> 19:57.574
I'm not giving her up.

19:58.579 --> 20:01.439
- You can't hold me.
- Oh, yes we can.

20:01.439 --> 20:04.629
You lied to us about your whereabouts.

20:09.761 --> 20:11.287
For how long?

20:15.411 --> 20:17.670
Okay. Look. My friend's married.

20:17.670 --> 20:20.491
If I give you her cell,
you got to promise...

20:25.061 --> 20:27.600
Don't call her at night.
You got me?

20:30.081 --> 20:32.160
Roy. I don't know what's more pathetic.

20:32.160 --> 20:34.377
The idea that you think we believe you

20:34.377 --> 20:38.007
or the idea that a woman
would willingly sleep with you.

20:39.551 --> 20:41.427
What's the matter, baby?

20:41.427 --> 20:45.037
You so used to ground chuck.
You don't know filet mignon when you see it?

20:45.037 --> 20:47.134
All those steroids you took...

20:47.134 --> 20:50.445
Your filet mignon wouldn't please
one woman. Let alone two.

20:53.668 --> 20:55.304
Now we can hold you for a long time.

20:55.304 --> 20:56.830
You got me wrong.

20:56.830 --> 20:59.044
I make women smile.

21:03.243 --> 21:04.518
Well...

21:05.909 --> 21:08.906
Roy knew that Avery was leaving him.

21:08.906 --> 21:12.796
Now, he could have followed
Woody and Avery to the Bronx

21:12.796 --> 21:16.204
and killed them while
they were switching plates.

21:16.204 --> 21:17.941
All that effort to escape Roy.

21:17.941 --> 21:20.590
And they end up leading him
to the perfect killing ground.

21:24.664 --> 21:30.939
Avery is a beautiful,
sweet, caring person.

21:30.939 --> 21:33.426
We just wanna see our daughter again.

21:35.138 --> 21:37.711
If you know where she is.

21:37.711 --> 21:40.866
Roy... please tell us.

21:42.428 --> 21:44.104
She's...

21:44.104 --> 21:46.388
She's all we care about.

21:47.864 --> 21:49.842
Tell us where she is, Roy.

21:58.698 --> 22:01.270
Woody's gone.
Isn't he, Danny?

22:02.633 --> 22:04.195
We don't know that.

22:05.437 --> 22:09.683
And if Roy knows where Woody is.
My detective will find him.

22:10.820 --> 22:14.802
Does his car have a GPS?
Can you see if he followed them?

22:15.663 --> 22:18.821
- Kathy. I can't discuss it.
- It's just...

22:18.821 --> 22:22.641
I'm sure whatever I'm thinking is
so much worse than what happened.

22:25.989 --> 22:27.979
Does he have an alibi?

22:30.375 --> 22:31.676
Maybe.

22:32.038 --> 22:33.806
We're checking it now.

22:41.226 --> 22:44.868
Whoever is saying those lies
should shut the hell up.

22:44.868 --> 22:47.885
Roy didn't kill Avery that night.
He was with me.

22:49.420 --> 22:51.528
Hotel Michiko.

22:52.195 --> 22:53.894
Well, you paid cash.

22:53.894 --> 22:56.588
Nice try.
Anyone could have paid cash.

22:56.588 --> 22:58.994
We need proof you were with Roy.

22:58.994 --> 23:02.258
Ask the room next to ours.
They must have heard us.

23:02.779 --> 23:05.605
Catch my meaning. Bullwinkle?

23:06.625 --> 23:09.296
Roy's your ex, isn't he?

23:09.296 --> 23:11.723
The one you had a restraining order against?

23:11.723 --> 23:13.573
Yeah. He went a little cuckoo one night.

23:13.573 --> 23:17.960
But Roy and I were meant to be together.
We just can't be together.

23:18.205 --> 23:22.317
Or maybe you're here because
you're still afraid of Roy.

23:22.317 --> 23:25.167
You got Roy all wrong.

23:25.167 --> 23:27.773
He knows how to make a woman purr.

23:30.016 --> 23:32.923
It's not good enough, Trina.
Thanks anyway.

23:32.923 --> 23:34.055
Okay.

23:34.892 --> 23:36.645
There's something else.

23:36.938 --> 23:40.490
But you have to swear on your mother
this doesn't end up on youtube.

23:43.211 --> 23:45.743
You have a sex tape with Roy.

23:45.743 --> 23:47.857
With a date and time stamp.

23:47.857 --> 23:49.906
Yeah. But those can be faked.

23:49.906 --> 23:51.686
Right, Trina?

23:52.018 --> 23:54.734
The ball game was on the whole time.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.877
We're both big Mets fans.

24:07.703 --> 24:09.935
- Roy. Please come over here.
- Here we go.

24:16.655 --> 24:18.216
I'm an innocent man.

24:18.216 --> 24:20.316
I've been freed unconditionally.

24:20.316 --> 24:23.984
I'm gonna sue NYPD and all of your networks
for damage to my reputation.

24:23.984 --> 24:25.288
Excuse me.

24:30.240 --> 24:32.089
They're letting him go.

24:32.089 --> 24:33.781
This is insane.

24:34.212 --> 24:37.467
Mom, Dad, I got a message from Avery.

24:37.813 --> 24:41.110
She and Woody, they're okay.
They eloped.

24:41.110 --> 24:42.553
They are okay.

24:49.123 --> 24:50.758
10,000.

24:52.022 --> 24:54.395
You sure this'll be
in Guadalajara by tonight?

24:54.395 --> 24:56.018
Be there in a few minutes.

24:56.885 --> 25:00.026
And... and all he'll need is
the code you're gonna give me?

25:00.026 --> 25:01.937
That and some ID.

25:01.937 --> 25:05.308
ID? wh... what kind of ID?

25:05.308 --> 25:07.496
Driver's license, passport.

25:08.867 --> 25:10.693
It's for your protection, lady.

25:10.693 --> 25:13.199
Look, I don't want your protection, got it?

25:13.199 --> 25:15.124
Just do what I say.

25:22.057 --> 25:25.935
I, I didn't speak to her.
It was text to my phone.

25:25.935 --> 25:31.266
She and Woody are probably
on some exotic Island with bad reception.

25:31.572 --> 25:34.820
Can I... see your cell phone?
Thanks.

25:35.759 --> 25:37.623
Tell mom I'm ok.
Me n Woody eloped! XOXO, Avery

25:37.623 --> 25:38.867
So is that her style.

25:38.867 --> 25:44.364
To text an "n" instead of actually
writing out the word "and"?

25:44.688 --> 25:46.190
Not always.

25:46.470 --> 25:48.435
It's Karl and Katrina.

25:48.435 --> 25:50.607
Excuse me, Detectives.

25:51.212 --> 25:53.041
Thank you, guys, for coming.

25:54.737 --> 25:58.114
Uh. Caleb, we'll need
to borrow your phone.

26:00.004 --> 26:02.363
You don't think the message is real.
Do you?

26:08.847 --> 26:11.892
No trace of Avery for a week.
Roy gets released.

26:11.892 --> 26:14.201
Suddenly she sends a text?

26:14.201 --> 26:16.901
Someone wants us to think
that she's alive.

26:17.489 --> 26:18.722
Woody.

26:18.722 --> 26:20.715
He was the last person with her
when she was.

26:20.715 --> 26:22.621
We tracked down Avery's cell signal.

26:22.621 --> 26:27.073
Her text was sent from JFK.
The International Departures Terminal.

26:29.677 --> 26:30.934
Avery's cell.

26:30.934 --> 26:33.523
Turned up in a trash can
next to the security gate.

26:33.523 --> 26:35.768
Somebody ditched it
before getting on a plane.

26:35.768 --> 26:37.410
We found Woody's car.

26:39.231 --> 26:41.973
Vacuum marks on the carpet.

26:43.712 --> 26:46.993
Cargo bay's been...
emptied, cleaned.

26:46.993 --> 26:51.288
No hairs in the headrest.
No obvious fibers on the belt.

26:55.523 --> 26:59.973
I've got an entry ticket to the lot.
The car came in at 4:00 yesterday.

26:59.973 --> 27:02.595
Right before Avery's text was sent.

27:06.674 --> 27:08.316
These look familiar?

27:09.215 --> 27:11.396
Prayer beads from Avery's bracelet.

27:11.396 --> 27:13.128
Yeah. With blood on them.

27:14.707 --> 27:16.267
The car's been here 24 hours.

27:16.267 --> 27:18.879
Woody could be anywhere
in the world by now.

27:25.874 --> 27:29.237
Let's assume DNA puts
Avery's blood on the beads.

27:29.237 --> 27:31.151
What makes Romeo kill Juliet?

27:31.151 --> 27:32.377
That ATM video...

27:32.377 --> 27:35.669
it looked like Avery was getting cold
feet at the last minute.

27:35.669 --> 27:37.174
Was he that in love with her?

27:37.174 --> 27:39.323
We know Kathy was pressuring
him to have a baby.

27:39.323 --> 27:41.081
Avery was his way out.

27:41.081 --> 27:44.177
If she bailed on him.
He might have snapped.

27:44.177 --> 27:46.838
And then he waits five days to run? Why?

27:46.838 --> 27:50.161
He has no reason to file.
Not as long as Roy is a suspect.

27:50.161 --> 27:53.869
Well, then, where has he been hiding?
Half of NYPD is looking for him.

27:53.869 --> 27:57.873
He's handsome and charming.
He has a car, cash, and jewelry.

27:57.873 --> 27:59.558
I'm sure he can take care of himself.

27:59.558 --> 28:05.113
Actually. I think he's, uh, more used to
letting people take care of him, sir.

28:07.170 --> 28:11.635
Any chance that Kathy has a beach house
that she hasn't told us about?

28:11.635 --> 28:14.133
She's not harboring him,
if that's what you're suggesting.

28:14.133 --> 28:15.862
You checked.

28:15.862 --> 28:17.340
Detective. You're out of line.

28:17.340 --> 28:19.013
Am I, Captain?

28:19.013 --> 28:22.145
We don't know if he's a missing person
or a murder suspect.

28:22.145 --> 28:25.828
He stole his wife's money
he staged a carjacking.

28:25.828 --> 28:29.291
And now his lover's blood
has turned up in his car at JFK.

28:29.291 --> 28:30.927
This isn't a leap.

28:35.359 --> 28:36.695
Moving on.

28:38.704 --> 28:40.872
If Woody is on the run.

28:40.872 --> 28:43.311
There's no record of him taking a flight

28:43.311 --> 28:45.728
or using his credit card
since he disappeared.

28:45.728 --> 28:47.493
Could have stolen an identity.

28:47.493 --> 28:49.912
What do we have on Woody?
I take it he doesn't have a record.

28:49.912 --> 28:52.609
No. At 23, he barely has a footprint.

28:52.609 --> 28:55.425
He got his driver's license four years ago.

28:55.425 --> 28:59.386
The first tax return he filed
was a joint one with Kathy.

28:59.386 --> 29:01.743
Maybe Woody sage isn't Woody sage.

29:01.743 --> 29:04.755
I mean, we know that
he lied to her about Avery.

29:04.755 --> 29:07.117
Maybe he lied to her
about more than that.

29:08.505 --> 29:12.276
Or... am I outta line?

29:12.983 --> 29:15.280
I'm sure these questions
have occurred to Kathy.

29:15.280 --> 29:19.926
- I'll ask her about...
- Uh... All due respect. Captain.

29:19.926 --> 29:21.676
It's our turn.

29:29.363 --> 29:31.880
Woody's parents?
They're dead.

29:31.880 --> 29:34.012
He was on his own by 16.

29:35.833 --> 29:37.912
There's no borthers. No sisters?

29:37.912 --> 29:39.140
No.

29:40.414 --> 29:43.554
These photos...
Everyone's from your world.

29:43.554 --> 29:46.543
Have you ever met anyone
from Woody's past?

29:46.543 --> 29:50.113
No. He was embarrassed
by his small-town roots.

29:50.113 --> 29:53.439
We had that in common.
He wiped that slate clean.

29:53.439 --> 29:55.662
Came to New York to make a new life.

29:56.502 --> 29:59.793
Now we're wondering
what was on that slate.

29:59.793 --> 30:01.554
I don't understand.

30:01.554 --> 30:06.121
We believe that your husband
is on the run,

30:06.121 --> 30:08.902
from killing Avery Hubert.

30:10.140 --> 30:12.081
That was the mistake.

30:13.224 --> 30:15.720
What mistake, Kathy?

30:18.155 --> 30:20.683
Woody called me two days ago.

30:22.087 --> 30:24.260
And you're just telling us this now?

30:24.717 --> 30:27.476
You know, the Captain put himself
on the line for you.

30:27.476 --> 30:30.553
I'm sorry. I'm malfunctioning.

30:31.043 --> 30:32.866
When he called. He said,

30:32.866 --> 30:36.306
that he'd made a terrible mistake
and wanted to come back.

30:36.306 --> 30:38.893
"Mistake"... I thought he meant leaving me.

30:40.201 --> 30:42.302
Did he ask you for any money?

30:48.036 --> 30:51.129
Kathy wired 10 grand to Scott Woodley.

30:51.129 --> 30:53.082
Turn's out that's Woody's real name.

30:53.082 --> 30:54.739
His dad's not dead.

30:54.739 --> 30:58.268
He's a grifter imprisoned
for the murder of Woody's mom.

30:58.979 --> 31:00.945
Bad parents don't have
to mean a bad kid.

31:00.945 --> 31:03.988
Still, I'm surprised Kathy
didn't pick up on any of this.

31:03.988 --> 31:05.829
Maybe she did and
she married him anyway.

31:05.829 --> 31:08.157
She's in her 40s,
on her third husband.

31:08.157 --> 31:10.066
Desperate for a baby.

31:10.848 --> 31:12.410
You track down Woody's flight?

31:12.410 --> 31:14.728
He didn't fly under Sage or Woodley.

31:14.728 --> 31:16.476
But he did leave his cell phone on.

31:16.476 --> 31:19.218
After he called Kathy from the airport.

31:19.218 --> 31:22.988
Uh, Woody's phone left JFK at 6:45.

31:22.988 --> 31:27.457
It stopped in Macon, Georgia, for two hours
and then landed in Mexico city.

31:27.457 --> 31:28.574
And since then?

31:28.574 --> 31:31.181
Well, the signal died at the airport.

31:31.181 --> 31:33.836
He hasn't picked up the money yet.

31:33.836 --> 31:37.049
Yeah. If he even, uh, flew down there.

31:37.480 --> 31:39.450
See these, uh, flight paths?

31:39.450 --> 31:44.341
These are commercial flights
leaving from JFK that night for Mexico city.

31:44.341 --> 31:46.276
They stop in Miami and Dallas.

31:46.276 --> 31:49.695
- None of them stop in Macon.
- No, no.

31:49.695 --> 31:51.739
No commercial flights.

31:54.102 --> 31:58.773
Macon is a hub for DJL.
The Delivery Package Service.

31:58.773 --> 32:03.725
So Woody shipped his phone
and bought himself another two days.

32:04.301 --> 32:07.433
He's a very clever personal trainer.

32:07.433 --> 32:11.914
Maybe money isn't the only help
Woody's crime-writer wife has given him.

32:11.914 --> 32:15.059
He's using her to help him get away.

32:16.922 --> 32:19.565
Or maybe she thinks he's coming back.

32:54.386 --> 32:57.063
I've been a fool
and you no longer trust me.

32:57.339 --> 32:59.240
Ask anything you need to know.

33:00.035 --> 33:01.111
Okay.

33:01.111 --> 33:04.461
Why did Woody have you
send him money to Mexico,

33:04.461 --> 33:05.909
when he wasn't there?

33:05.909 --> 33:09.806
Because he's getting a kick out of this.

33:09.806 --> 33:12.885
He's getting off on making me.
Kathy Jarrow, true crime writer.

33:12.885 --> 33:16.124
Look like a heartbroken teenager.

33:16.124 --> 33:18.463
So this... is all about you.

33:19.071 --> 33:20.580
Touche.

33:21.549 --> 33:23.634
But, you know.
On some level, yes.

33:23.634 --> 33:25.641
I mean, I thought Woody,
because he was younger.

33:25.641 --> 33:27.903
could deal with a powerful woman.

33:27.903 --> 33:29.996
He resented my success.

33:29.996 --> 33:31.594
I get that.

33:31.594 --> 33:34.808
But it doesn't explain why he killed Avery.

33:35.044 --> 33:37.164
Well, she was in a bad marriage.

33:37.164 --> 33:39.015
Then we made the same mistake.

33:39.015 --> 33:41.920
We both asked a sociopath
to give us what we needed.

33:41.920 --> 33:45.003
A week ago he was an old soul, so...

33:45.003 --> 33:48.071
Uh, now he's a sociopath?

33:48.533 --> 33:51.420
Well, they're masters at hiding
that side of themselves.

33:51.420 --> 33:53.242
As I'm sure you know.

33:53.937 --> 33:56.094
I just can't believe I let this happen.

33:56.094 --> 33:57.967
To myself and that poor girl.

33:57.967 --> 34:00.314
I can't believe you never
looked into Woody's past.

34:00.314 --> 34:02.403
You know. I started to yesterday.

34:03.018 --> 34:07.416
I had a friend from Ohio
send me his sealed juvie record.

34:08.043 --> 34:09.594
Just yesterday.

34:09.594 --> 34:13.202
His mother used him early on.
Then she was murdered.

34:13.202 --> 34:16.587
It's possible Woody's father
took the rap for him.

34:17.036 --> 34:20.833
Kathy. In hindsight,
there had to have been clues.

34:20.833 --> 34:23.666
Something that might
help us track him now.

34:25.967 --> 34:29.224
Yeah. I loved him.

34:30.007 --> 34:33.585
Woody burst into my life
with energy and charm.

34:33.585 --> 34:35.502
He gave me hope.

34:42.879 --> 34:45.464
I understand Kathy apologized.

34:45.464 --> 34:47.797
More like self-flagellation.

34:48.080 --> 34:50.899
She told me her blinders are off
and she's on the case.

34:50.899 --> 34:52.721
What about your blinders?

34:54.321 --> 34:57.402
You know that she's lying to you.

34:57.680 --> 35:00.494
She's used her connections to...

35:00.494 --> 35:04.553
uh, the department...
to lead us around from day one, sir.

35:04.553 --> 35:08.926
Kathy has been a good friend
and a colleague for 20 years.

35:08.926 --> 35:12.050
Then you knew
her second husband, Judge Feld.

35:12.050 --> 35:13.655
Of course. I went to their wedding.

35:13.655 --> 35:17.177
The obits were sketchy
on his place of death.

35:18.574 --> 35:20.466
There's a reason for that.

35:24.962 --> 35:28.493
Judge Feld died one morning
in a fleabag motel

35:28.493 --> 35:31.512
under circumstances
that were never made public.

35:31.512 --> 35:33.676
How old was the prostitute?

35:34.410 --> 35:38.134
Let's just say the combined
ages of both boys was short of 40.

35:38.134 --> 35:40.694
Oh, she really can pick them, can't she?

35:40.943 --> 35:42.996
NYPD covered it up?

35:43.337 --> 35:46.773
Judge Feld had a teenage daughter
from an earlier marriage.

35:46.773 --> 35:48.891
And we didn't wanna
put her through all that.

35:48.891 --> 35:52.829
Yeah, and the Judge cheated on her.
And so did Woody.

35:52.829 --> 35:54.658
And they're both dead.

35:55.701 --> 35:59.172
What are you saying,
that she's a serial killer?

36:01.949 --> 36:03.594
Where are the bodies?

36:03.594 --> 36:07.106
We still don't have Woody's,
but we do have Feld's.

36:07.106 --> 36:09.830
We'd need a court order to exhume it.

36:14.383 --> 36:16.187
Well, ya lucked out.

36:16.187 --> 36:20.393
The judge's body wasn't embalmed.
And the expensive casket helped.

36:20.604 --> 36:23.414
I got enough of his liver
to do a full tox screen.

36:23.414 --> 36:24.669
And?

36:26.298 --> 36:31.031
An excessive level...
of sildenafil citrate.

36:31.031 --> 36:34.026
Better known by its brand name, V-boost.

36:34.026 --> 36:36.481
Popular drug of men of a certain age.

36:36.481 --> 36:39.672
Guess he needed help
romping around with teenage hustlers.

36:39.672 --> 36:41.202
Ah, who doesn't?

36:41.202 --> 36:44.974
But Judge Feld took blood pressure meds.

36:44.974 --> 36:46.595
Now, I spoke to his doctor.

36:46.595 --> 36:49.461
The judge was very aware
of what he could and couldn't take.

36:50.346 --> 36:54.106
And how high was his V-boost level?

36:54.106 --> 36:56.024
Triple a normal dose.

36:56.024 --> 36:59.706
Combining those drugs in that circumstance
was a recipe for a heart attack.

36:59.706 --> 37:03.220
If there had been an autopsy.
Bells would have gone off.

37:06.004 --> 37:10.044
It's hard to imagine Kathy didn't know
about the judge's sex life.

37:10.589 --> 37:14.005
I mean, he was... probably
meeting boys online.

37:14.005 --> 37:16.846
Arranging hookups.

37:17.704 --> 37:20.408
Kathy's written about spyware.

37:20.408 --> 37:24.656
She hacks into his emails,
heard about a tryst,

37:24.656 --> 37:28.522
spikes his morning decaf
so he'd die in flagrant.

37:35.922 --> 37:37.224
Captain?

37:41.886 --> 37:46.816
Take a longer look at Kathy's...
cell records and GPS.

37:46.816 --> 37:49.779
Find out what she knew about
Woody's plans and when.

38:01.287 --> 38:02.731
Thank you for coming.

38:03.004 --> 38:05.639
Hope the directions weren't confusing.

38:05.639 --> 38:07.374
You said you may have
missed something.

38:07.374 --> 38:09.452
That's why Woody's Rover's here?

38:09.452 --> 38:12.671
Yeah, this is where he turned off his GPS.

38:12.671 --> 38:14.444
And where you think he killed Avery.

38:14.444 --> 38:16.250
We may have found her.

38:16.250 --> 38:18.481
A body turned up nearby.

38:19.102 --> 38:24.154
We need you to help us imagine
what was going on in Woody's head

38:24.154 --> 38:26.387
when he and Avery eloped.

38:26.573 --> 38:28.610
Well, I'd hardly call it eloping.

38:28.610 --> 38:31.715
Avery told her parents Woody proposed.

38:31.715 --> 38:34.125
They were going up to Maine to celebrate.

38:34.125 --> 38:36.180
We kept it out of the press.

38:37.022 --> 38:38.441
I see.

38:39.710 --> 38:43.680
Well, clearly, Woody couldn't
tolerate commitment.

38:43.680 --> 38:47.822
She must have pressured him,
the same way I pressured him to start a family.

38:47.822 --> 38:50.802
And when she did.
He may have lashed out

38:50.802 --> 38:53.122
like the damaged kid he was.

38:53.122 --> 38:54.211
I get it... you mean.

38:54.211 --> 39:00.150
You know, it's the way that he and Avery
planned to run away.

39:00.150 --> 39:02.605
He stole money from the cookie jar.

39:02.605 --> 39:07.337
He left a broken taillight for show
and his license plate for tell.

39:07.337 --> 39:10.455
- Exactly.
- See, that's where I get confused.

39:11.316 --> 39:16.283
His carjacking story was immature.
But his aftermath...

39:16.283 --> 39:18.458
leaving no trace of his kill.

39:18.458 --> 39:21.682
Hiding himself and this car for five days.

39:21.682 --> 39:23.627
Shipping his cell phone...

39:23.627 --> 39:26.494
It's like he was two separate people.

39:26.494 --> 39:29.334
He was a second-generation con artist.

39:30.594 --> 39:33.867
Kathy. Detectives.
Sorry I'm late.

39:34.360 --> 39:36.294
Your directions were wrong, Eames.

39:36.294 --> 39:38.137
Well, Kathy had no trouble.

39:38.137 --> 39:40.196
Well, I double-checked with my GPS.

39:40.196 --> 39:41.820
Oh. Your GPS?

39:42.070 --> 39:44.936
Well, this lot isn't on a GPS grid.

39:44.936 --> 39:47.190
I must use a different service.

39:48.854 --> 39:51.190
That be the same as Woody's?

39:54.138 --> 39:58.322
Is that how you... tracked him
the night that he drove here?

39:59.525 --> 40:01.035
Excuse me.

40:01.723 --> 40:05.120
Danny, wrong directions?
That's their idea of a... of a trap?

40:05.120 --> 40:08.141
Detective, you checked Kathy's GPS.
She wasn't here.

40:08.141 --> 40:10.792
Captain, she could have turned it off.

40:10.792 --> 40:14.089
I mean, we double-checked Woody's GPS.

40:14.927 --> 40:17.977
Someone hacked into it
and then tracked him here.

40:17.977 --> 40:19.666
Where... where is all this coming from?

40:19.666 --> 40:21.373
- Coming from you.
- From me?

40:21.373 --> 40:22.982
Yeah. You.

40:22.982 --> 40:25.874
You're... you're systematic... you know?

40:25.874 --> 40:29.624
You clean your car and...

40:30.718 --> 40:34.722
You leave exactly two bloody mala beads.

40:34.722 --> 40:38.646
You drive to the airport,
and you send a fake text.

40:38.646 --> 40:43.728
You ship a cell phone that
just happens to be... left on.

40:43.728 --> 40:50.215
You know, is... is that why your books
never really get to that level of art?

40:50.215 --> 40:52.447
Oh, you're a critic now.

40:52.447 --> 40:54.088
You've stopped writing.

40:54.088 --> 40:58.541
But I mean why research someone else's crime
when you can just plot your own?

40:58.781 --> 41:02.124
- I loved Woody.
- Maybe too much.

41:02.443 --> 41:04.279
You didn't follow him here.

41:04.816 --> 41:07.412
March him into the water.

41:07.412 --> 41:10.354
And then shoot him
so there'd be no blood?

41:10.354 --> 41:11.797
Into the water.

41:11.797 --> 41:14.456
Well, then his body would
have surfaced by now.

41:14.456 --> 41:18.413
Kathy's right. She would have known to
cut his stomach so that he'd sink.

41:18.413 --> 41:21.337
Guns, knives...
there should be blood here.

41:21.337 --> 41:23.178
You smarter than that.

41:23.178 --> 41:26.770
I mean, you'd know
to lay a tarp down under them.

41:26.770 --> 41:29.209
Like the one in your nursery.

41:29.501 --> 41:31.045
Oh, I did all that.

41:31.514 --> 41:34.576
Okay, well, then I'm also smart enough
to know that you don't have a body.

41:34.576 --> 41:37.300
Oh, but we do, Kathy.

41:37.811 --> 41:40.751
No. No. That's impossible.

41:40.751 --> 41:43.576
Even if Danny didn't tell me.
Your department leaks like a sieve.

41:43.576 --> 41:45.831
- I'd have heard.
- You wanna see it?

41:46.175 --> 41:49.307
It's not a pretty sight.
Four years in the ground.

41:50.226 --> 41:53.572
A triple dose of V-boost
and blood pressure pills.

41:53.572 --> 41:56.380
Very systematic.

41:57.820 --> 41:58.826
What?

41:58.826 --> 42:02.199
The judge.
He's in that van.

42:03.971 --> 42:06.382
So what happened.
Too old to give you a baby?

42:06.382 --> 42:10.867
Maybe he was just too busy having sex
with teenage boys?

42:11.664 --> 42:13.904
I mean, he left you for boys.

42:13.904 --> 42:16.111
Is that why you married one?

42:16.111 --> 42:19.010
Danny, you're letting them
tear me apart... why?

42:19.010 --> 42:20.885
Because I rejected you?

42:21.170 --> 42:24.122
You're right.
She really is a narcissist.

42:24.122 --> 42:26.699
I helped you when I thought
you were in distress.

42:26.699 --> 42:29.394
You used me to cover up three murders.

42:30.567 --> 42:32.494
You're on your own. Kathy.

42:34.326 --> 42:37.259
God, it's actually vindicating
to know for certain

42:37.259 --> 42:41.100
that just when I need you to protect me
you betray me.

42:41.474 --> 42:44.743
Yeah, but, you're used to that, right?

42:44.743 --> 42:48.926
You're successful
and you're... you're beautiful.

42:48.926 --> 42:52.719
But... that's not enough
for the men that you choose.

42:52.719 --> 42:55.375
The old ones cheat with the young ones.

42:55.375 --> 42:57.975
The young ones with the even younger.

42:59.087 --> 43:01.421
And some of them are just fools.

43:03.294 --> 43:04.620
Go to hell.

43:05.977 --> 43:07.640
Danny, no!

43:07.640 --> 43:09.166
They had it coming.

43:09.595 --> 43:11.922
He was giddy about leaving me.

43:11.922 --> 43:13.717
She called me the cougar!

43:14.018 --> 43:16.015
He called me worse.

43:16.794 --> 43:19.128
I couldn't stand the humiliation, not again.

43:19.128 --> 43:21.615
Kathy Jarrow, you are under arrest.

43:22.909 --> 43:25.281
This isn't how this is supposed to end.

43:25.696 --> 43:28.315
Danny. Danny!

43:31.214 --> 43:32.553
Captain.

43:33.044 --> 43:34.942
Not now, Detective.

43:34.942 --> 43:36.526
Not one word.
