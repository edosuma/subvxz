WEBVTT

00:42.833 --> 00:45.999
HIDDEN

02:26.625 --> 02:27.582
Well?

02:30.166 --> 02:31.249
Nothing.

02:37.166 --> 02:38.249
Where was it?

02:39.500 --> 02:41.790
In a plastic bag on the porch.

02:49.458 --> 02:50.874
What's wrong?

03:18.916 --> 03:20.540
He must have been there.

03:22.541 --> 03:23.832
Come inside.

03:47.291 --> 03:51.915
I'll ask the Rochants and Beaufays
if they saw anybody hanging around.

03:52.083 --> 03:54.040
I called Antoine.
He saw nothing.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.832
I got Marie's answering machine.

03:59.916 --> 04:01.790
The tape runs for over 2 hours.

04:23.333 --> 04:24.540
When did you leave?

04:24.708 --> 04:28.082
I don't know. Not long after you.
Around 8:45.

04:28.250 --> 04:29.249
Francois called...

04:29.416 --> 04:30.332
There!

04:31.875 --> 04:32.957
Give it here.

04:50.416 --> 04:53.707
How come I didn't see him?
It'll remain a mystery.

04:55.500 --> 04:57.790
Maybe the camera was in a car.

04:57.958 --> 05:00.707
It doesn't look
filmed through a window.

05:02.458 --> 05:04.540
Or someplace on that house.

05:10.916 --> 05:13.582
It's dumb.
I don't know what to say.

05:15.125 --> 05:17.499
Whose idea of a joke could this be?

05:18.625 --> 05:21.540
We should eat
before it's totally ruined.

05:31.875 --> 05:33.582
Maybe a friend of pierrot's.

05:33.750 --> 05:37.749
Some idiot playing games
on his pal's bobo parents.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.540
I doubt it.
It's not particularly funny.

05:44.458 --> 05:45.874
That's for sure.

05:49.458 --> 05:50.832
Where is he anyway?

05:51.000 --> 05:52.374
- Who?
- Pierrot.

05:52.875 --> 05:55.124
No idea.
He'll be home soon.

06:02.958 --> 06:04.124
Was it in there?

06:04.250 --> 06:05.790
- What?
- The tape.

06:05.958 --> 06:08.249
No, in a supermarket bag.

06:08.416 --> 06:09.457
Where is it?

06:10.500 --> 06:14.624
I've no idea. Through there,
on the dining table, or in the hall.

06:14.791 --> 06:15.832
What does it matter?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.290
Wasn't there a note or anything?

06:18.458 --> 06:20.832
Nothing's stopping you
taking a look.

06:23.458 --> 06:25.040
Can you bring the salad?

06:36.541 --> 06:38.499
No great shakes tonight.

06:39.875 --> 06:40.999
Here.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.749
That the bag it was in?

07:03.166 --> 07:05.457
I'm not a complete idiot, y'know!

07:07.708 --> 07:10.249
You could have missed something.

07:12.750 --> 07:16.124
Eject the tape,
maybe I missed a label or something.

07:16.333 --> 07:18.749
I'm only trying to...

07:20.000 --> 07:21.332
The sonny boy!

07:21.791 --> 07:23.707
Better late than never.

07:26.208 --> 07:27.249
Hi there.

07:27.583 --> 07:28.624
Hi.

07:28.833 --> 07:31.249
Sit down, Pierrot,
I'll get you a plate.

07:42.041 --> 07:43.207
Where were you?

07:43.375 --> 07:44.999
At Yves'. Why?

07:45.166 --> 07:47.832
Why? I want to know.
Do I need a reason?

07:50.125 --> 07:52.124
- Evening, pierrot.
- Evening, Mom.

07:52.583 --> 07:53.624
Are you OK?

07:56.083 --> 07:57.207
Well?

07:58.500 --> 07:59.957
Tuesdays, I go to Yves'.

08:00.125 --> 08:04.165
Wednesdays, we have geometry
and he helps with my homework.

08:07.875 --> 08:09.624
Maybe it's one of your fans.

08:19.083 --> 08:21.582
Pierrot,
don't breathe in the breakout.

08:27.416 --> 08:30.957
Andre, same for you.
Don't breathe in the breakout.

08:31.250 --> 08:31.999
What?

08:32.166 --> 08:34.082
Hold your breath in the breakout.

08:34.250 --> 08:36.539
Thomas, think about your kick.

08:42.041 --> 08:46.165
pierrot, too shallow on the turn.
More depth.

08:52.375 --> 08:54.957
Andre,
that's good but you went too deep.

08:56.083 --> 08:57.790
Too much depth.

09:00.041 --> 09:02.124
Thomas, watch your breathing.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.915
See you at the same time
in two weeks

11:50.083 --> 11:51.582
for another Round Table.

11:51.750 --> 11:53.415
Until then, good reading

11:53.583 --> 11:57.165
and thanks to all the new viewers
tuning in every week.

11:57.333 --> 11:58.582
Goodnight.

11:59.125 --> 12:02.040
Stay seated
while the credits roll, please!

12:11.041 --> 12:12.457
Thank you everybody!

12:42.791 --> 12:43.957
It's me.

12:47.375 --> 12:49.415
The tape was wrapped in it.

13:19.625 --> 13:20.665
What's up?

13:21.875 --> 13:23.415
What's wrong?

13:24.500 --> 13:25.582
Georges?

13:28.000 --> 13:29.165
What?

13:31.250 --> 13:32.540
Nothing.

13:33.666 --> 13:34.874
Nothing, I...

13:37.500 --> 13:38.707
I'm tired.

13:44.125 --> 13:45.999
What should we do now?

13:47.375 --> 13:48.499
What do you mean?

13:49.875 --> 13:51.707
You want to call the police?

13:53.458 --> 13:54.832
Yes...

13:56.875 --> 13:58.165
No...

13:58.333 --> 14:01.249
I don't know.
Let me see the drawing again.

14:07.958 --> 14:10.290
Maybe we should report it now.

14:15.041 --> 14:17.249
It looks like a child's drawing.

14:18.791 --> 14:20.665
I've no idea, I couldn't say.

14:23.416 --> 14:24.999
Should I ask Pierrot?

14:27.708 --> 14:29.040
No, what's the use?

14:30.750 --> 14:34.415
You think his pals
would stay out all night to spy on us?

14:34.583 --> 14:36.207
How stupid would that be?

14:40.625 --> 14:42.165
Why'd you stop the tape?

14:42.333 --> 14:43.874
Why not?

14:44.875 --> 14:46.707
What more do you want to see?

14:48.666 --> 14:50.874
It's dumb but it scares me.

14:56.791 --> 14:58.332
Did you talk to pierrot?

14:59.250 --> 15:02.249
No, do you think we should?

15:03.333 --> 15:04.582
I don't know.

15:05.791 --> 15:08.540
I don't buy
the schoolboy prank theory.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.082
What then?

15:10.250 --> 15:13.165
What then?
How should I know!

15:32.333 --> 15:33.374
Mrs. Laurent?

15:33.541 --> 15:36.040
Hi, this is Manu.
Is Georges there?

15:36.208 --> 15:38.999
You missed him
by a couple of minutes. Sorry.

15:39.166 --> 15:41.665
It was to remind him
about the Beaumont file.

15:41.833 --> 15:43.415
He took it. I saw him.

15:43.583 --> 15:46.415
Great, thank you.
Have a good day!

15:46.541 --> 15:47.874
Bye, Manu.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.832
I'd like to speak to Georges Laurent.

16:00.916 --> 16:02.249
Who is this?

16:02.916 --> 16:05.290
I'd like to speak to Georges Laurent.

16:06.125 --> 16:08.749
Who are you? What do you want?

16:08.958 --> 16:12.499
I'd like to speak to the man
by the name of Georges Laurent.

16:15.791 --> 16:18.249
Your wife called.
Can you call her back?

16:18.416 --> 16:19.749
OK, thank you.

16:32.291 --> 16:33.665
What's this?

16:34.083 --> 16:35.582
It was in the mail.

16:44.083 --> 16:45.707
Watch out, dickhead!

16:48.000 --> 16:48.874
What?

16:49.041 --> 16:50.957
Can't you be more careful, idiot!

16:51.125 --> 16:51.790
Forget it.

16:51.958 --> 16:54.582
Say that again.
Repeat what you just said.

16:54.750 --> 16:57.124
Don't you have eyes in your head?

16:57.500 --> 16:58.749
I must be dreaming!

16:58.916 --> 17:01.249
Which moron stepped out
without looking?

17:01.416 --> 17:04.165
But who's going the wrong way
down a one-way?

17:08.583 --> 17:10.082
Yell at me some more.

17:10.625 --> 17:11.707
C'mon, yell at me!

17:11.875 --> 17:13.540
OK, let's not fight about it.

17:13.708 --> 17:16.957
You weren't looking
and we weren't looking, OK?

17:19.833 --> 17:21.832
Keep your big mouth shut, will ya!

17:42.250 --> 17:43.374
I'm sorry.

17:44.625 --> 17:45.624
In any case...

17:46.958 --> 17:49.290
We know now we're on our own.

17:49.708 --> 17:54.207
Until he torches the house
or sends us bombs instead of tapes,

17:54.583 --> 17:55.540
everything's dandy.

17:55.708 --> 17:57.249
please, Georges.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.124
Hi, Dad.

18:57.291 --> 18:58.290
Hi, pierrot.

18:58.708 --> 19:01.040
- What's up?
- What do you mean?

19:01.208 --> 19:03.374
Why are you picking me up?

19:08.166 --> 19:10.665
I was free.
I thought you'd appreciate it.

19:12.333 --> 19:13.290
Right.

19:14.708 --> 19:17.749
No, I dropped Mom at work
and I wanted us to talk.

19:18.125 --> 19:20.582
Why? Where was she?

19:21.375 --> 19:26.040
We had stuff to do.
That's why I wanted to talk to you, too.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.457
Right.

19:30.666 --> 19:32.790
What's with that card you sent?

19:33.791 --> 19:34.540
What card?

19:39.875 --> 19:40.915
This one.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.665
My teacher gave it to me at recess.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.165
She didn't get the freaky drawing

19:48.333 --> 19:51.499
but said it's weird
you sending me cards at school.

21:21.291 --> 21:25.040
Sitting right at the far end,
near the mirror, you know.

21:25.208 --> 21:29.582
Never make a lady wait, especially
an elderly lady, so I go over.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.749
I give my name
and ask why she wants to see me.

21:32.916 --> 21:35.332
She apologizes
for summoning me like that.

21:35.500 --> 21:38.165
She offers me a seat.
She seems very emotional,

21:38.333 --> 21:40.082
so I sit beside her.

21:40.375 --> 21:42.790
She says she's never been here before

21:43.000 --> 21:45.124
and doesn't ever talk to strangers

21:45.291 --> 21:49.624
but I remind her of someone
and she can't help herself.

21:49.791 --> 21:53.624
It was someone she was very close to.
What could I do?

21:53.958 --> 21:57.915
She was in her 70s.
It was touching, her hands trembled.

21:58.083 --> 21:59.332
Anyway...

21:59.791 --> 22:02.165
You know I'm not a sentimental guy.

22:03.541 --> 22:05.790
But she'd gotten to me.

22:06.125 --> 22:10.832
So I'm eagerly waiting to hear
about this guy I remind her of.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.624
Who do you think it was?

22:13.416 --> 22:15.665
Her lover? Father? Husband?

22:17.833 --> 22:19.249
It was her dog.

22:19.416 --> 22:20.957
Exactly.

22:21.333 --> 22:24.374
What would you have done?
I stand up and I say,

22:24.541 --> 22:27.749
"Excellent, you've had your fun,"
and I turn to go.

22:27.916 --> 22:30.249
Straight-faced,
she begs me to sit down.

22:30.416 --> 22:33.249
She says
she knows it sounds ridiculous

22:33.416 --> 22:36.624
but I must stay a bit longer
and hear her out.

22:36.791 --> 22:39.249
She wouldn't dare make fun of me.

22:39.958 --> 22:43.040
It was weird
but she seemed so desperate,

22:43.208 --> 22:44.540
I sat back down.

22:45.083 --> 22:49.165
And she begins her story.
How her dog died in an accident in '64.

22:49.333 --> 22:53.332
That's funny, I say, I was born in '64.

22:53.750 --> 22:57.249
She seemed offended
that I wasn't taking her seriously.

22:57.458 --> 22:59.957
She looked at me sadly and said,

23:00.291 --> 23:03.832
"He was run over by a van
on April 17, 1964,

23:04.000 --> 23:06.290
"as we were about to cross the road."

23:07.583 --> 23:09.040
April 17

23:09.375 --> 23:10.749
is my birthday.

23:11.541 --> 23:13.040
No way!

23:14.333 --> 23:15.999
That's precisely what I said.

23:16.166 --> 23:18.332
So she fills me in on the details.

23:18.625 --> 23:23.415
She stepped out with her dog
but a high vehicle hid the van,

23:23.625 --> 23:25.082
which ran over the dog.

23:25.250 --> 23:28.332
The bumper hit its neck.
The wound was deep.

23:28.541 --> 23:30.832
The dog died soon after.

23:31.750 --> 23:33.207
You won't believe this...

23:33.416 --> 23:34.665
Give me your hand.

23:34.958 --> 23:37.624
I have a scar in the exact same place.

23:54.583 --> 23:56.790
C'mon, is it true or not?

24:05.500 --> 24:06.624
Not bad.

24:07.791 --> 24:09.665
Who told you that one?

24:10.291 --> 24:11.540
You don't believe me?

24:19.916 --> 24:21.790
You know Frederic called me?

24:23.083 --> 24:25.290
Simone's better.
The op was last week.

24:26.333 --> 24:28.957
We've hardly been to see her recently.

24:29.125 --> 24:32.999
To be honest, we were never close.
She was always so distant.

24:33.166 --> 24:35.665
It's hard to develop a bond.

24:35.833 --> 24:37.790
- And Frederic?
- He's writing a film.

24:38.500 --> 24:39.832
About that?

24:40.916 --> 24:41.957
No, but Maubert bought it.

24:42.500 --> 24:44.957
Where's her daughter
while she's in the hospital?

24:45.083 --> 24:46.915
With him and his girlfriend.

24:47.333 --> 24:48.207
What's she like?

24:48.791 --> 24:49.749
Nice.

24:50.541 --> 24:54.540
It's tough when friends break up
and you have to take sides.

24:55.500 --> 24:56.957
Frederic's changed.

24:57.125 --> 24:59.415
He's more congenial
since he met Marianne.

24:59.583 --> 25:00.874
Her name's Marianne?

25:02.125 --> 25:04.082
What's the script about?

25:05.125 --> 25:06.540
What script?

25:06.958 --> 25:09.249
Isn't Frederic writing one?

25:09.958 --> 25:11.874
Oh, yeah...
I've no idea.

25:15.250 --> 25:16.124
More guests?

25:23.416 --> 25:24.624
I'll go see.

25:25.958 --> 25:27.999
Who can it be at this time?

25:29.083 --> 25:30.790
- No idea.
- One of his fans.

25:30.916 --> 25:32.040
The price of fame.

25:32.208 --> 25:33.540
Groupies desperate for...

25:42.875 --> 25:49.207
Who's there?

26:28.708 --> 26:30.249
What's this all about?

26:30.916 --> 26:32.999
Show yourself, you coward!

26:33.166 --> 26:35.582
Show yourself
and say what you want!

26:40.416 --> 26:41.832
pathetic!

27:49.875 --> 27:51.624
Apparently, it plays till the 15th...

27:51.791 --> 27:53.332
- Well?
- Nothing.

27:54.125 --> 27:56.332
- Nothing?
- There was nobody.

27:57.708 --> 27:58.957
There was nobody outside.

27:59.125 --> 28:00.290
OK then...

28:01.875 --> 28:05.040
You're spoiling us.
I'll have to diet for 3 weeks.

28:05.750 --> 28:07.999
Why were you out there so long?

28:15.500 --> 28:18.832
It's OK. Everything's OK.
There's no problem.

28:20.791 --> 28:23.124
I'm not some kind ofjealous wife

28:23.291 --> 28:25.749
who suspects hubby's cheating on her.

28:25.916 --> 28:27.165
- Thank you.
- Sorry.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.790
I'm on edge
because in the last few days

28:30.958 --> 28:34.249
we've received
anonymous parcels and phone calls.

28:35.166 --> 28:39.207
When the doorbell rings,
I think it's our asshole stalker.

28:39.416 --> 28:40.749
What kind of calls?

28:41.375 --> 28:43.832
I don't know how to describe them.

28:45.083 --> 28:46.624
You went to the police?

28:46.750 --> 28:47.999
Of course.

28:48.166 --> 28:48.915
And?

28:49.083 --> 28:51.665
And nothing.
They'll move when he attacks us.

28:51.833 --> 28:52.874
It's outrageous!

28:53.625 --> 28:55.082
It's a fact.

28:56.208 --> 28:58.874
Dig in before it gets cold.

29:01.041 --> 29:02.374
So what was it?

29:06.875 --> 29:07.999
What's up with him?

29:11.708 --> 29:15.457
Since Anne has decided
to share the good news with you,

29:16.583 --> 29:17.999
I won't hide it.

29:22.791 --> 29:24.457
Are you happy now?

29:26.333 --> 29:28.415
It's not very entertaining.

29:29.291 --> 29:31.499
We receive shots of our house,

29:32.333 --> 29:35.415
presumably to show us
we're under surveillance.

29:36.875 --> 29:39.707
With all Anne's comings-and-goings.
Mine, Pierrot's...

29:39.875 --> 29:41.915
You've no idea who's filming and how?

29:42.083 --> 29:42.999
For now, no.

29:43.166 --> 29:45.040
- Let's see.
- Here goes.

30:08.333 --> 30:09.707
What's that?

30:12.666 --> 30:14.499
The house I grew up in.

30:52.958 --> 30:55.290
Will you still be needing me?

30:55.458 --> 30:57.374
- No, thank you.
- Right.

30:58.583 --> 30:59.540
Goodnight.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.249
Don't just stand there.
Sit down.

31:12.250 --> 31:16.957
Don't look so shocked.
She's there just in case, that's all.

31:20.416 --> 31:21.790
I'm sorry.

31:22.166 --> 31:24.749
- What for?
- I didn't know...

31:24.916 --> 31:26.207
Stop that.

31:26.666 --> 31:27.957
It's ridiculous.

31:29.791 --> 31:31.707
Tell me how you're doing.

31:32.375 --> 31:36.665
Fine. Since we spoke on the phone,
nothing's changed.

31:37.500 --> 31:39.957
pierrot's battling with puberty.

31:40.125 --> 31:41.540
Anne's overworked.

31:41.708 --> 31:44.040
Me, too.
And that's about it.

31:46.958 --> 31:48.790
Aunt Julie wrote me a letter.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.415
From Marseille.

31:52.083 --> 31:54.999
She never misses your show on TV.

31:56.333 --> 31:59.999
She says she envies me
having a son like you.

32:00.500 --> 32:01.915
That's nice.

32:03.083 --> 32:06.124
She'll hit 80 this year.

32:06.291 --> 32:07.374
Really?

32:10.166 --> 32:10.915
What's wrong?

32:12.291 --> 32:14.499
You're all pent up.
What is it?

32:15.041 --> 32:16.499
Nothing. I'm fine.

32:16.958 --> 32:19.332
I don't enjoy seeing you unwell.

32:20.458 --> 32:22.290
What do you mean, "unwell?"

32:23.583 --> 32:25.249
For my age, I'm very well!

32:26.083 --> 32:28.749
Don't bother
spouting nonsense like that.

32:30.708 --> 32:33.124
Isn't it lonely if you can't go out?

32:33.458 --> 32:34.624
Why?

32:36.166 --> 32:40.874
Are you less lonely
because you can sit in the garden?

32:42.041 --> 32:46.249
Do you feel less lonely in the Metro
than at home?

32:47.916 --> 32:48.707
Well then!

32:50.333 --> 32:53.124
Anyway, I have my family friend...

32:54.125 --> 32:55.624
With remote control.

32:57.208 --> 33:00.165
Whenever they annoy me,
I just shut it down.

33:05.041 --> 33:07.540
I miss not hearing the piano.

33:09.416 --> 33:11.415
Ever since your Dad died.

33:13.875 --> 33:15.582
Do you still play?

33:16.333 --> 33:18.165
I don't have time, you know.

33:18.583 --> 33:19.665
Shame.

33:22.583 --> 33:24.957
And Pierrot, is he gifted?

33:26.125 --> 33:28.874
He's not interested.
He prefers to hang out.

33:30.416 --> 33:31.749
He's 12 now, isn't he?

33:37.583 --> 33:39.374
What brings you down here?

33:39.750 --> 33:43.790
I'm going to Aix for a special
on Francois Weyergans.

33:44.166 --> 33:47.207
He's publishing a new novel,
his first in ages.

33:47.458 --> 33:48.540
Really?

33:50.041 --> 33:52.290
You know who I dreamed about?

33:53.750 --> 33:54.457
Majid.

33:55.500 --> 33:56.499
Who's Majid?

33:56.666 --> 33:58.332
You know! Majid!

33:58.958 --> 34:00.207
You've lost me.

34:02.250 --> 34:05.707
Hashem's son.
The kid you planned to adopt!

34:06.916 --> 34:07.790
I see.

34:08.458 --> 34:09.873
Odd, isn't it?

34:10.166 --> 34:11.415
What's odd?

34:11.583 --> 34:13.081
After so many years.

34:14.375 --> 34:16.206
Nothing odd about it.

34:17.166 --> 34:19.248
I often dream of my childhood.

34:20.083 --> 34:21.831
It comes with age.

34:22.375 --> 34:24.873
Sure, but I'm not that old.

34:25.583 --> 34:27.998
It goes faster than you think.

34:30.083 --> 34:32.081
Do you ever think about him?

34:33.875 --> 34:34.956
About who?

34:35.291 --> 34:36.081
Majid.

34:38.416 --> 34:39.540
How come?

34:40.000 --> 34:41.373
"How come?"

34:42.083 --> 34:44.665
How come
you don't think about him ever?

34:44.833 --> 34:47.956
It was a big thing
for you and Dad at the time.

34:48.875 --> 34:52.456
It was a long time ago.
And it's not a happy memory.

34:53.416 --> 34:55.873
As you know only too well.

34:59.791 --> 35:01.290
What did you dream?

35:01.458 --> 35:04.040
Stupid stuff,
but it brought him back to mind.

35:04.208 --> 35:05.790
I'd forgotten him.

35:08.916 --> 35:10.707
What does Anne do?

35:10.875 --> 35:14.332
She's well. She still works
for the same publishers.

35:14.500 --> 35:18.040
She runs her own schedule.
Her boss is a friend of ours.

35:18.500 --> 35:19.457
Very handy.

35:21.083 --> 35:25.124
I don't know what more I can tell you.
We hardly see each other

35:25.291 --> 35:28.790
and when we do,
I've nothing special to tell you.

35:29.333 --> 35:32.207
Mostly, we chug along.
No great highs or lows.

35:32.375 --> 35:34.707
I'm fine. Anne's fine.

35:35.041 --> 35:36.582
pierrot's fine.

35:37.041 --> 35:39.499
As far as I can tell, at least.

35:40.291 --> 35:42.915
We're all very busy
and that's about it.

35:44.541 --> 35:47.207
But I get the feeling you're not fine.

35:47.916 --> 35:49.749
You seem strange, Georges.

35:52.375 --> 35:55.499
Listening to you,
I'm worried about you.

35:57.666 --> 35:58.457
What's going on?

35:59.708 --> 36:00.874
What do you mean?

36:02.125 --> 36:03.499
Come on...

36:05.208 --> 36:06.540
No, seriously?

36:11.916 --> 36:13.207
When are you leaving?

36:13.625 --> 36:16.665
Tomorrow morning.
I have to be in Aix by 12.

36:17.708 --> 36:19.790
You'll have to leave early then.

36:22.958 --> 36:26.999
Shall I ask Mrs. Arnaud
to prepare breakfast for us?

36:29.250 --> 36:30.540
You're up that early?

36:31.958 --> 36:33.624
I don't sleep much now.

36:34.750 --> 36:37.707
That's one of the benefits of old age.

36:39.666 --> 36:42.290
I need my bed. I'm dead.
Goodnight.

36:48.166 --> 36:50.707
Can I get you something?
You need anything?

36:50.875 --> 36:53.915
No, I'm fine. I have all I need.

36:59.291 --> 37:01.290
What time for breakfast?

37:01.666 --> 37:02.790
7 o'clock?

37:04.583 --> 37:05.707
Shall I tell her?

37:10.625 --> 37:11.624
Light off?

37:17.791 --> 37:19.249
He's not a baby any more.

37:19.416 --> 37:24.124
I like not having him around some days.
He can be a little macho prick.

37:27.541 --> 37:29.874
Yes, I wonder who he gets it from.

37:32.333 --> 37:33.665
When will you be home?

37:34.291 --> 37:36.124
Can you pick him up at school?

37:36.291 --> 37:39.415
I can't tomorrow,
we have to pack up here.

37:39.583 --> 37:42.624
It was our last launch
in this noble location.

37:43.916 --> 37:47.499
Yes, there are a lot of people.
It's swarming, in fact.

37:50.833 --> 37:52.165
Yes, I'll tell him.

37:55.041 --> 37:55.832
Love you too.

39:43.208 --> 39:43.999
Morning, Mom.

40:55.208 --> 40:57.040
There was a street sign.

41:18.916 --> 41:20.332
I can't make it out.

41:20.750 --> 41:23.457
Le... nin?

41:23.791 --> 41:25.082
Wouldn't you say?

41:25.250 --> 41:26.332
Avenue Lenin.

41:27.958 --> 41:29.915
Yes, Avenue Lenin.
But where?

41:30.083 --> 41:31.665
Can you get the map?

41:32.500 --> 41:33.499
Hold on.

41:46.541 --> 41:49.249
Romain... Romainville!
Try Romainville.

41:49.416 --> 41:51.749
See if there's an Avenue Lenin.

41:52.458 --> 41:53.415
Hold on.

41:54.583 --> 41:55.665
Got it!

41:56.541 --> 41:59.999
Near Mairie des Lilas Metro station.
Line 11.

42:00.583 --> 42:01.874
Right there.

42:07.333 --> 42:09.040
What are you going to do?

42:09.208 --> 42:10.415
Go over there.

42:11.458 --> 42:13.374
It's near Guillaume's place.

42:14.500 --> 42:15.540
And?

42:16.375 --> 42:20.040
I'll go over, knock on the door
and see what happens.

42:21.333 --> 42:22.499
As simple as that?

42:22.666 --> 42:25.499
Sure, as simple as that.
Got a better idea?

42:25.666 --> 42:27.165
Why not the police?

42:27.416 --> 42:29.082
We got the hallway, the street.

42:29.250 --> 42:32.249
Take a cop with you.
It's the least they can do.

42:32.416 --> 42:35.374
What if it's a bluff, a practical joke?

42:35.541 --> 42:37.415
You believe that? Seriously?

42:38.000 --> 42:42.249
What does the tape show?
A street and a low-rent hallway.

42:42.416 --> 42:45.082
They'll just say,
"Try knocking on the door

42:45.250 --> 42:48.957
"and if someone half kills you,
come see us again."

42:51.375 --> 42:54.082
Who knows
the house where you grew up?

42:55.541 --> 42:56.832
I don't know.

42:59.125 --> 43:01.207
Do you recognize the building?

43:03.125 --> 43:04.915
Right, we'll...

43:07.458 --> 43:09.332
We'll hire a private detective.

43:10.208 --> 43:12.749
You watch too many TV crime movies.

43:13.625 --> 43:16.624
You're impossible to talk to.
Do it your way.

43:18.625 --> 43:19.832
I have a hunch.

43:20.000 --> 43:20.915
What?

43:21.708 --> 43:23.582
I think I know who it is.

43:26.291 --> 43:27.582
You know who it is?

43:28.916 --> 43:30.415
I think I know.

43:31.583 --> 43:32.624
And?

43:33.833 --> 43:36.165
And I have to make sure.

43:37.583 --> 43:39.374
What's wrong with you?

43:40.208 --> 43:43.207
Maybe you could share
your great wisdom.

43:43.375 --> 43:45.124
perhaps this concerns me, too.

43:46.583 --> 43:48.915
I can't tell you because I don't know.

43:51.125 --> 43:52.582
It's only a hunch.

43:54.583 --> 43:56.540
You can't let me in on it?

44:04.458 --> 44:07.499
Gee, I don't know what I...

44:08.916 --> 44:10.207
You realize what you're saying?

44:10.375 --> 44:12.332
please, it's not what you think.

44:12.500 --> 44:13.540
What do I think?

44:14.875 --> 44:17.582
Will you cut it out?
I have a vague hunch.

44:17.750 --> 44:21.832
I can't say any more until I'm sure.
It's not your concern.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.540
It's not my concern?

44:24.583 --> 44:26.665
I guess I just dreamt it all!

44:28.000 --> 44:32.290
I thought it was my concern,
being terrorized by anonymous calls

44:32.500 --> 44:33.957
and these fucking videos!

44:34.875 --> 44:36.957
Being too scared to go out!

44:38.333 --> 44:40.540
Not my concern?
Awake all night

44:40.708 --> 44:43.790
worrying about Pierrot and you,
and all this crap!

44:43.958 --> 44:46.415
If it's not my concern,
business as usual.

44:46.583 --> 44:50.124
Would you like dinner
or perhaps I can get you a drink?

44:50.541 --> 44:51.915
Please, if I'd known...

44:52.083 --> 44:55.665
What would you have done?
Kept your mouth shut?

44:55.833 --> 44:56.999
please...

44:57.166 --> 44:59.582
D'you realize the bullshit you talk?

44:59.750 --> 45:02.374
You never heard of trust?

45:03.416 --> 45:06.790
You realize
you're doing exactly what he wants?

45:06.958 --> 45:11.374
He wants to wreck our lives.
You're reacting exactly as he wants.

45:11.541 --> 45:13.415
Can't you just trust me?

45:13.583 --> 45:17.665
I have to trust you?
Why not the other way round for once?

45:18.208 --> 45:22.082
How about you trust me?
Who refused to give trust here?

45:23.000 --> 45:26.832
Imagine the shoe's on the other foot.
Imagine I say...

45:27.250 --> 45:31.374
"I may know who's terrorizing us
but I can't tell you." Great!

45:32.958 --> 45:37.415
That's your idea of a sound relationship
"based on mutual trust?"

45:41.791 --> 45:43.499
If you could hear yourself!

46:41.041 --> 46:42.082
Just a second!

46:43.583 --> 46:44.582
I'm coming!

46:53.000 --> 46:54.832
Sorry, I was in the middle of...

46:59.333 --> 47:00.915
Look who it is!

47:02.458 --> 47:03.624
Who are you?

47:06.500 --> 47:07.957
Wanna come in?

47:22.250 --> 47:23.749
After you.

47:39.625 --> 47:40.832
Take a seat.

47:45.666 --> 47:47.040
I was making lunch.

47:47.208 --> 47:49.124
What do you want from me?

47:51.125 --> 47:52.582
What do I want? Me?

47:52.791 --> 47:54.207
Do you want money?

47:54.875 --> 47:56.749
- Money?
- What then?

48:00.625 --> 48:02.707
Mind saying how you found me?

48:11.500 --> 48:15.374
It's a game, is that it?
I don't want to play. I've grown up.

48:15.500 --> 48:16.707
I see that.

48:16.875 --> 48:19.290
So, what's the point of your actions?

48:19.583 --> 48:21.874
- What actions?
- Don't bullshit me!

48:24.500 --> 48:26.832
Mind telling me why you're here?

48:28.666 --> 48:30.040
How did you find me?

48:40.416 --> 48:42.999
- What's this?
- Don't act dumb.

48:55.750 --> 48:56.790
Well?

49:06.541 --> 49:08.249
Sit down, won't you?

49:18.125 --> 49:21.665
Don't believe I didn't expect to see you
but it's true.

49:22.875 --> 49:25.874
You're the last person
I expected at my door.

49:28.208 --> 49:28.999
Right.

49:29.458 --> 49:32.040
I'll play along
to see where it gets us.

49:32.208 --> 49:35.707
I could also report you
to the police quite simply.

49:35.916 --> 49:39.415
So, you had no idea
and you're amazed to see me.

49:40.291 --> 49:44.582
Who do you think drew me here?
Who's been terrorizing my family?

49:44.958 --> 49:46.374
I don't know.

49:47.083 --> 49:49.415
Why do you talk
like we're strangers?

49:52.250 --> 49:54.665
You wouldn't have recognized me, huh?

49:54.958 --> 49:57.582
Outside,
you'd have walked right past me.

49:59.666 --> 50:01.749
At first, I wasn't sure either.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.749
When I tuned into your show
by chance,

50:06.708 --> 50:08.082
a few years ago...

50:08.250 --> 50:11.290
The show
with the two chairs stuck together...

50:11.625 --> 50:15.540
You sat up close to your guests,
face to face...

50:17.041 --> 50:18.999
I wasn't sure either.

50:20.041 --> 50:22.832
I just had a nasty feeling in my gut.

50:25.458 --> 50:26.749
Weird, isn't it?

50:27.791 --> 50:31.165
I felt nauseous
and I didn't know why.

50:32.833 --> 50:35.665
When your name came up,
I began to understand.

50:37.458 --> 50:38.540
And then...

50:40.208 --> 50:41.332
The nose.

50:47.500 --> 50:51.415
How d'you wind up on TV?
You didn't take over the estate?

50:53.708 --> 50:55.124
Tell me what you want.

50:56.416 --> 50:57.415
Nothing.

51:00.458 --> 51:03.290
What could I want from you?
What do you suppose?

51:03.458 --> 51:04.499
Money?

51:06.875 --> 51:10.665
You barge in
accusing me of trying to blackmail you.

51:14.375 --> 51:15.915
You haven't changed.

51:17.041 --> 51:19.082
What can I blackmail you with?

51:21.208 --> 51:22.874
Who sent me the tapes?

51:23.166 --> 51:24.540
The tapes?

51:27.875 --> 51:31.332
Strange, isn't it?
I haven't fought since I was a child.

51:31.875 --> 51:33.540
I find it repugnant.

51:37.083 --> 51:38.332
And right now...

51:40.250 --> 51:43.665
- Stop this stupid game...
- Or you'll kick my ass?

51:44.416 --> 51:48.499
That shouldn't be hard.
You're a lot bigger than the last time.

51:49.833 --> 51:53.790
Kicking my ass
won't leave you any wiser about me.

51:55.416 --> 51:58.124
Even if you beat me to death.

51:58.916 --> 52:00.832
But you're too refined for that.

52:02.791 --> 52:05.124
Above all, you have too much to lose.

52:07.541 --> 52:08.582
What?

52:09.125 --> 52:10.332
That's not true?

52:11.625 --> 52:13.207
I think it is.

52:14.208 --> 52:17.165
What wouldn't we do
not to lose what's ours?

52:23.333 --> 52:27.124
You were older and stronger than me.
I had no choice.

52:28.958 --> 52:30.540
Right, then.

52:35.541 --> 52:36.540
Your Mom's sick.

52:38.125 --> 52:39.874
Where do you get that from?

52:40.041 --> 52:41.999
It's not hard to guess, is it?

52:44.083 --> 52:45.874
What do you want? Revenge?

52:50.791 --> 52:53.082
She was a very kind lady.

52:54.583 --> 52:56.999
I was very grateful to her, you know.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.457
To your father, too.

53:02.583 --> 53:04.290
I'm going to leave now.

53:04.750 --> 53:07.374
If you try to interfere in my life,

53:07.541 --> 53:09.832
scare my family or damage me,

53:10.000 --> 53:11.749
you'll regret it, I swear.

53:11.916 --> 53:13.415
You're threatening me?

53:13.791 --> 53:15.790
Yes, I'm threatening you.

53:15.958 --> 53:17.540
Believe me, I mean it.

53:17.750 --> 53:19.124
I believe you.

53:19.666 --> 53:21.540
But you don't believe me.

53:22.458 --> 53:24.332
I didn't want anything from you.

53:25.625 --> 53:29.249
I never sent you a tape
or anything else.

53:32.250 --> 53:33.540
Not this either.

53:38.666 --> 53:40.915
I'm glad you came.

55:11.250 --> 55:13.915
This is Georges Laurent.
Could I speak to my wife?

55:14.708 --> 55:15.790
Thank you.

55:18.666 --> 55:20.040
Hi, it's me.

55:20.625 --> 55:22.915
I went round. Nobody was in.

55:25.333 --> 55:28.624
No, it was just one in a row of doors.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.290
It was locked.

55:33.458 --> 55:34.915
I did.

55:35.083 --> 55:36.915
He said it was unoccupied.

55:38.583 --> 55:41.582
It must be a storeroom
or something like that.

56:21.958 --> 56:24.290
She was a very kind lady.

56:25.333 --> 56:27.999
I was very grateful to her, you know.

56:28.791 --> 56:30.707
To your father, too.

56:31.625 --> 56:35.499
I'm going to leave now,
but you can be sure of something.

56:37.375 --> 56:39.582
If you try to interfere in my life,

56:39.750 --> 56:41.999
scare my family or damage me,

56:42.166 --> 56:43.707
you'll regret it, I swear.

56:43.833 --> 56:45.040
You're threatening me?

56:45.208 --> 56:47.457
Yes, I'm threatening you.

56:47.625 --> 56:48.874
Believe me, I mean it.

56:49.041 --> 56:50.415
I believe you.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.915
But you don't believe me.

56:53.708 --> 56:55.749
I didn't want anything from you.

56:56.916 --> 57:00.499
I never sent you a tape
or anything else.

57:03.416 --> 57:04.874
Not this either.

57:09.041 --> 57:10.915
I'm glad you came.

58:11.583 --> 58:13.207
That's it.

58:15.875 --> 58:16.999
It runs for 1 hour

58:17.166 --> 58:19.540
if you want to watch how he feels.

58:32.833 --> 58:33.957
I'm sorry.

58:34.125 --> 58:35.165
What for?

58:40.291 --> 58:41.374
What now?

58:43.916 --> 58:47.207
It was dumb of me to lie to you.
I apologize.

58:47.375 --> 58:48.665
I don't get it.

58:48.833 --> 58:49.582
I'm sorry!

58:49.750 --> 58:51.540
I don't get your attitude.

58:53.416 --> 58:56.374
You say sorry
and everything's OK, right?

58:57.000 --> 58:59.832
Do you want me to beg?
What's so terrible?

59:00.000 --> 59:03.999
I lied to save you more stress.
Has the world stopped spinning?

59:07.833 --> 59:09.040
I'm sorry.

59:13.833 --> 59:15.082
I suspected it was him.

59:15.250 --> 59:18.165
Not at first
but after the tape of Mom's house.

59:18.333 --> 59:20.499
I wanted to spare you.

59:24.125 --> 59:26.082
His parents worked for us.

59:26.250 --> 59:29.957
Dad liked them.
I guess they were good workers.

59:31.500 --> 59:34.582
In October '61,
the FLN called all Algerians

59:34.750 --> 59:37.165
to a demonstration in paris.

59:37.500 --> 59:40.332
October 17, 1961.
Enough said.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.874
Papon. The police massacre.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.999
They drowned
about 200 Arabs in the Seine.

59:46.583 --> 59:50.790
Including Majid's parents most likely.
They never came back.

59:52.125 --> 59:54.124
Dad went to paris
to look for them.

59:54.291 --> 59:59.082
They said he should be glad
to be rid of a couple ofjigaboos.

01:00:02.666 --> 01:00:03.790
And then?

01:00:07.041 --> 01:00:09.582
My parents decided to adopt the boy.

01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:11.207
I don't know why.

01:00:13.041 --> 01:00:15.249
They felt responsible in some way.

01:00:18.708 --> 01:00:19.374
And then?

01:00:19.541 --> 01:00:22.040
It annoyed me.
I didn't want him at home.

01:00:22.208 --> 01:00:25.874
He had his own room.
I had to share, see. I was 6!

01:00:30.333 --> 01:00:31.749
So what did you do?

01:00:32.791 --> 01:00:35.082
Nothing.
I told lies about him.

01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:38.207
You told lies about him?

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:42.790
That's all?

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.124
So now he wants revenge?

01:00:48.291 --> 01:00:49.374
Apparently.

01:00:55.375 --> 01:00:57.165
You threatened him.

01:00:58.291 --> 01:01:00.415
Not particularly intelligent of me.

01:01:00.583 --> 01:01:01.707
Not particularly intelligent?

01:01:01.875 --> 01:01:04.582
Stupid, I know.
I was out of my depth.

01:01:07.458 --> 01:01:09.415
I don't think he's lying.

01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:10.915
What do you mean?

01:01:11.083 --> 01:01:12.665
He was genuinely surprised.

01:01:12.833 --> 01:01:13.624
But the tape?

01:01:13.833 --> 01:01:16.290
Which one? You think it's staged?

01:01:16.708 --> 01:01:18.707
He'd have to be very smart.

01:01:19.875 --> 01:01:22.874
Who else could it be?
I can't read his mind.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.415
Why send us it?

01:01:25.666 --> 01:01:28.415
To keep me informed.
Unlike you.

01:01:28.583 --> 01:01:31.582
- So who sent the others?
- How should I know?

01:01:37.291 --> 01:01:39.040
What kind of lies?

01:01:39.875 --> 01:01:41.040
I don't know.

01:01:42.125 --> 01:01:44.874
The usual stuff kids lie about.

01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:47.707
Things you make up. Stupid stuff.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.915
- Well?
- Well what?

01:01:53.125 --> 01:01:54.874
Stop acting like an idiot!

01:01:55.041 --> 01:01:58.915
If it was over a teddy,
he wouldn't want revenge 40 years on.

01:01:59.083 --> 01:02:00.457
I don't remember!

01:02:04.458 --> 01:02:06.624
You don't want to tell me, you mean?

01:02:06.875 --> 01:02:10.582
What do you want?
I've no idea. I don't remember.

01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:13.207
You remember stuff you did aged 6?

01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:20.374
What happened to him?

01:02:23.416 --> 01:02:25.915
He was sent away.
He was sick.

01:02:26.083 --> 01:02:29.915
To a hospital or a children's home,
I don't know which.

01:02:30.083 --> 01:02:34.374
I was glad he was gone.
I forgot all about it. It's natural.

01:02:38.458 --> 01:02:39.624
And your parents?

01:02:40.916 --> 01:02:42.624
Forgot it too, I guess.

01:02:42.791 --> 01:02:45.582
It was only an interlude
of a few months.

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:47.249
An interlude?

01:02:47.375 --> 01:02:49.749
What should I call it?
A tragedy?

01:02:49.916 --> 01:02:52.207
Maybe it was a tragedy, I don't know.

01:02:52.375 --> 01:02:55.415
I don't feel responsible for it.
Why should I?

01:02:55.958 --> 01:02:57.332
It's all so absurd.

01:03:00.083 --> 01:03:02.499
You mentioned it to your mother?

01:03:02.666 --> 01:03:03.749
Sure.

01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:07.040
Nice to see there's someone you trust.

01:03:07.833 --> 01:03:11.332
Jesus! She knows about him.
I didn't mention the tapes.

01:03:12.666 --> 01:03:14.915
Well? What did she say?

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.499
Nothing.

01:03:18.791 --> 01:03:21.540
She's getting old.
She can't remember.

01:03:21.708 --> 01:03:23.665
Or doesn't want to, I don't know.

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:25.457
It's too unpleasant for her.

01:03:48.541 --> 01:03:50.915
Thanks for being so quick.
How's it going?

01:03:51.083 --> 01:03:52.540
Great, thanks. And you?

01:03:52.708 --> 01:03:55.207
Snowed under,
you know what it's like.

01:03:55.541 --> 01:03:57.124
please, take a seat.

01:04:00.291 --> 01:04:03.332
How's your wife?
I haven't seen her for ages.

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.124
She's very well.

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:09.124
They just published Pereira's book
on globalization.

01:04:09.291 --> 01:04:11.207
It was her baby and it's a hit.

01:04:11.375 --> 01:04:15.332
Good. I must buy it
but you know how it is, never the time.

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:16.665
Give her my regards.

01:04:16.833 --> 01:04:17.999
Of course. Thank you.

01:04:19.166 --> 01:04:19.790
Coffee?

01:04:19.958 --> 01:04:22.749
No, thanks,
I've had my fill for today.

01:04:25.666 --> 01:04:28.957
I'll cut to the chase.
I guess you think you're here

01:04:29.125 --> 01:04:32.790
to talk about the concept
for your new show.

01:04:33.625 --> 01:04:35.207
That'll have to wait.

01:04:35.375 --> 01:04:38.707
The Head of Programming
is sitting tight till summer.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.790
The decision was due by May 15.

01:04:40.916 --> 01:04:43.540
I know but what can I say?

01:04:43.708 --> 01:04:48.165
The Lord works in mysterious ways.
public TV even more so.

01:04:48.541 --> 01:04:51.874
Don't worry.
We always talk them round, don't we?

01:04:52.041 --> 01:04:53.165
May God hear you!

01:04:53.333 --> 01:04:55.374
Sadly, polytheism reigns here.

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:58.249
But as I said, don't worry.
It'll work out.

01:04:58.416 --> 01:05:00.707
With your prestige and viewing figures!

01:05:00.916 --> 01:05:02.415
Yeah, sure.

01:05:03.416 --> 01:05:04.415
Anyway...

01:05:04.958 --> 01:05:07.707
I wanted to see you
about a silly matter

01:05:08.083 --> 01:05:10.290
that I'm not sure how to deal with.

01:05:11.541 --> 01:05:14.457
Yesterday,
my secretary left a tape on my desk.

01:05:15.166 --> 01:05:17.832
Addressed to me
but without a note.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.707
Usually, she wouldn't even show me it,

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:23.832
just take a quick look
and toss it in the trash.

01:05:24.166 --> 01:05:27.624
I've no interest in the crap
your fanclub sends in.

01:05:28.208 --> 01:05:30.457
But she thought I should see it.

01:05:30.625 --> 01:05:33.915
The tape shows you
having a private conversation

01:05:34.291 --> 01:05:36.457
with a man in a kind of flat.

01:05:36.833 --> 01:05:40.874
The subject isn't apparent
and I didn't want to be indiscreet

01:05:41.708 --> 01:05:43.790
but it's clearly a hidden camera.

01:05:45.458 --> 01:05:47.832
I wanted to ask if you knew about it

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:50.665
and, if you do, what you think.

01:05:52.375 --> 01:05:54.707
I'm sorry you got dragged into this.

01:05:55.916 --> 01:06:00.540
The guy's the son ofAlgerian farmhands
who worked for my parents.

01:06:02.166 --> 01:06:04.749
He has a pathological hatred
of my family

01:06:04.916 --> 01:06:08.290
and he tries to hurt me with this stuff.
Sorry.

01:06:09.208 --> 01:06:12.582
That's OK,
it can't be very pleasant for you.

01:06:13.291 --> 01:06:14.415
You told the police?

01:06:14.666 --> 01:06:18.790
They won't do anything
as long as it remains "harmless."

01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:22.290
Apparently,
he's out to wreck your career.

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.415
God knows who he sent the tape to.

01:06:25.583 --> 01:06:27.124
That's true.

01:06:31.333 --> 01:06:33.040
Why's he so bitter?

01:06:34.125 --> 01:06:37.915
Sorry to pry
but he didn't appear very aggressive.

01:06:38.583 --> 01:06:42.165
Yes, I know.
I'm the aggressive one on the tape.

01:06:42.333 --> 01:06:46.499
My visit was the consequence
of his campaign of terror.

01:06:46.958 --> 01:06:50.290
My wife and I
are very worried naturally.

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:51.874
I'm not surprised.

01:06:52.458 --> 01:06:54.832
You've no idea what's driving him?

01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:57.915
None at all.

01:06:58.416 --> 01:07:01.540
He's convinced
my family and I mistreated him.

01:07:01.916 --> 01:07:05.540
In fact, the last time I saw him,
I was 6. He's crazy.

01:07:08.125 --> 01:07:10.707
You have my sympathy.
It's quite awful.

01:07:12.166 --> 01:07:14.040
I hope it's resolved soon.

01:07:15.458 --> 01:07:18.790
It would be unfortunate
if news of this leaked out.

01:07:20.041 --> 01:07:22.874
I know.
I'll put a lawyer on the case.

01:07:24.375 --> 01:07:25.832
Do so. Good idea.

01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:30.332
Don't worry about the new show,
I'll keep at them.

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:31.374
Great, thanks.

01:07:31.541 --> 01:07:34.124
Not at all.
You know how highly I rate you.

01:07:34.291 --> 01:07:36.332
Thank you.
Can I have the tape?

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:37.957
The tape?

01:07:38.916 --> 01:07:42.582
I destroyed it
to stop it falling into the wrong hands.

01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:43.790
I see.

01:07:44.375 --> 01:07:46.040
You'd have done the same.

01:08:43.916 --> 01:08:45.082
Open up!

01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:56.790
Open the damn door!

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:09.790
What else could he do?

01:09:09.957 --> 01:09:11.040
That's great.

01:09:12.541 --> 01:09:15.207
You'd have bullshitted Mathilde
like that?

01:09:16.707 --> 01:09:18.957
People talk to each other, don't they?

01:09:23.791 --> 01:09:24.915
Calm down.

01:09:26.541 --> 01:09:28.290
Calm down, it's OK.

01:09:57.833 --> 01:09:59.915
Time to get back to the office.

01:10:01.666 --> 01:10:04.874
But the Governor of Nassiriyah province,

01:10:05.083 --> 01:10:08.832
an Italian appointed by the Americans,
Barbara Contini,

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.707
demands greater openness
on the subject.

01:10:11.875 --> 01:10:14.207
The Italians come under British command

01:10:14.375 --> 01:10:17.082
as the official occupying power.

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:22.665
It's vital all coalition countries,

01:10:22.833 --> 01:10:25.582
who have joined in this mission

01:10:25.708 --> 01:10:28.832
operate
under the same rules of engagement.

01:10:31.875 --> 01:10:36.124
This will ensure greater homogeneity
and better coordination.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.915
Ultimately,
the Italian president Ciampi...

01:10:43.083 --> 01:10:44.040
About time!

01:10:45.916 --> 01:10:47.499
Where have you been?

01:10:50.625 --> 01:10:51.832
I ate out with Pierre.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.874
Without telling me?
Why switch your cell off?

01:10:55.041 --> 01:10:56.040
Why?

01:10:57.458 --> 01:10:59.582
Do you tell me everything you do?

01:10:59.791 --> 01:11:01.124
Don't start that!

01:11:01.291 --> 01:11:02.707
Don't you start!

01:11:05.958 --> 01:11:07.290
Is Pierrot in bed?

01:11:08.833 --> 01:11:10.624
I thought he was with you.

01:11:10.958 --> 01:11:14.165
With me?
I was at work, don't you know?

01:11:17.416 --> 01:11:20.374
He was going round to Yves'
after school.

01:11:22.166 --> 01:11:23.332
You have his number?

01:11:29.125 --> 01:11:32.165
He was going
to swim practice at 5 with Yves

01:11:32.333 --> 01:11:34.874
and Yves' Dad was picking them up.

01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:56.665
This is Anne Laurent.

01:11:57.375 --> 01:12:00.665
I wanted to ask if you've seen Pierrot.

01:12:06.958 --> 01:12:07.915
Really?

01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:11.249
Did he say anything?

01:12:14.625 --> 01:12:17.999
If you don't mind,
can I talk to him in person?

01:12:22.333 --> 01:12:23.749
Hello, Yves.

01:12:23.916 --> 01:12:27.124
Did pierrot tell you where he was going?

01:12:28.791 --> 01:12:30.207
No, that's the point.

01:12:37.041 --> 01:12:39.040
Were you doing anything after?

01:12:41.250 --> 01:12:43.082
Did you have a fight?

01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:46.040
I don't know...
OK, I see.

01:12:46.208 --> 01:12:49.999
If you hear anything, can you call?
You have our number?

01:12:50.708 --> 01:12:53.332
OK, thank you. Goodbye.

01:12:54.916 --> 01:12:57.665
He left Yves' house around 6.30.

01:12:59.166 --> 01:13:02.415
He said he'd be away with us
for the Ascension weekend.

01:13:05.875 --> 01:13:08.457
I'll go look in his room.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:53.915
Well?

01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:56.874
I don't know.

01:14:35.083 --> 01:14:36.874
We have to call the police.

01:14:37.166 --> 01:14:39.165
What if something's happened to him?

01:14:39.333 --> 01:14:40.415
- What?
- I don't know.

01:14:40.583 --> 01:14:43.415
What if he's been hit by a car or...

01:15:34.208 --> 01:15:35.582
Open up! Police!

01:15:44.208 --> 01:15:45.665
- What's up?
- Where's the boy?

01:15:45.833 --> 01:15:47.040
What boy?

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:48.499
Is that him?

01:15:53.041 --> 01:15:54.165
Any sign of him?

01:15:57.833 --> 01:16:00.082
I'm going with them to the station.

01:16:01.875 --> 01:16:03.332
I've got no idea.

01:16:05.791 --> 01:16:07.290
He has a son.

01:16:08.625 --> 01:16:11.665
It must have been him
who made the tapes.

01:16:12.666 --> 01:16:16.832
They claim that they don't even know
who pierrot is.

01:16:19.625 --> 01:16:21.457
No, they only looked for pierrot.

01:16:21.833 --> 01:16:24.832
They're investigating kidnapping,
not the tapes.

01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:28.207
Did anybody call?

01:16:30.250 --> 01:16:32.707
I was just asking, you never know.

01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:37.499
I have to go.
If there's any news, call me.

01:16:37.875 --> 01:16:38.999
Of course.

01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:44.165
You'd better go home now.

01:17:44.416 --> 01:17:46.624
You have an early flight tomorrow.

01:17:46.791 --> 01:17:49.707
Don't worry, I packed yesterday.
You know me.

01:17:49.875 --> 01:17:53.749
You've been really sweet
but I prefer to be alone now.

01:17:53.916 --> 01:17:57.040
On your own,
you'll imagine the worst.

01:17:57.416 --> 01:17:58.832
C'mon, let's go.

01:18:01.875 --> 01:18:04.415
If you need anything, just call.

01:18:06.208 --> 01:18:07.332
Promise?

01:18:18.833 --> 01:18:20.374
You can call any time.

01:18:21.333 --> 01:18:22.540
I know.

01:18:22.708 --> 01:18:24.540
Corsica isn't another planet.

01:18:24.708 --> 01:18:25.999
See you, sweetheart.

01:18:27.708 --> 01:18:29.499
- Well?
- No news.

01:18:30.833 --> 01:18:34.332
It probably wasn't an accident.
No reports from the hospitals.

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:35.457
And the two guys?

01:18:35.625 --> 01:18:37.874
They claim they don't know him.

01:18:38.041 --> 01:18:38.957
What about the tapes?

01:18:39.125 --> 01:18:39.999
They deny it.

01:18:40.166 --> 01:18:43.749
Look, just drop it.
The police aren't interested,

01:18:43.916 --> 01:18:45.207
except in the kidnapping.

01:18:45.375 --> 01:18:47.665
For the tapes, we need proof.

01:18:47.791 --> 01:18:51.790
There's a procedure to be followed.
File a report, lawyer...

01:18:52.208 --> 01:18:54.040
The cops don't care if it's linked.

01:18:54.250 --> 01:18:55.624
So they released them?

01:18:55.791 --> 01:18:57.540
Don't you want to come in?

01:18:57.708 --> 01:18:59.374
- We're leaving.
- We'd be in the way.

01:18:59.541 --> 01:19:01.790
Don't talk crap!
Come on in...

01:19:01.958 --> 01:19:03.915
I asked them to go.

01:19:04.083 --> 01:19:06.665
I was exhausted
and wanted to be alone.

01:19:07.416 --> 01:19:09.040
I'm sorry.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.582
All this is...

01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:15.082
It makes me sick.

01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:17.707
No, they kept them in custody.

01:19:18.125 --> 01:19:21.957
The kid started yelling,
so they locked him up.

01:19:22.125 --> 01:19:24.415
That got his dad started...

01:19:24.583 --> 01:19:27.874
so now they're both in the cage
for the night.

01:19:28.041 --> 01:19:29.749
- And then?
- They'll let them go.

01:19:29.916 --> 01:19:32.499
If there's no proof, they have to.

01:19:32.666 --> 01:19:34.999
There's suspicion, nothing more.

01:19:35.458 --> 01:19:37.124
What will you do now?

01:19:37.291 --> 01:19:38.457
Now, I...

01:19:38.625 --> 01:19:41.957
I'm going to grab some food.
I didn't eat all day.

01:21:16.083 --> 01:21:18.165
What the hell got into you?

01:21:18.416 --> 01:21:19.957
I'm sorry.

01:21:20.333 --> 01:21:23.165
Anne Laurent...
Thank you very much.

01:21:23.458 --> 01:21:24.582
Come in, please.

01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:26.749
No, thanks. I'm badly parked.

01:21:26.916 --> 01:21:31.040
I called my husband,
who's also delighted and says thank you.

01:21:31.875 --> 01:21:33.374
It's the least I could do.

01:21:33.541 --> 01:21:34.457
Come on in.

01:21:34.625 --> 01:21:38.207
No, I have to go.
I just wanted to be sure he got home.

01:21:38.375 --> 01:21:39.582
What do you mean?

01:21:39.875 --> 01:21:41.707
I owe you an apology.

01:21:41.875 --> 01:21:43.499
Whatever for?

01:21:43.708 --> 01:21:45.915
I work nights at the hospital,

01:21:46.083 --> 01:21:48.165
so I'm not always around.

01:21:48.333 --> 01:21:50.915
When Francois has friends over...

01:21:51.083 --> 01:21:53.332
We're quite laidback.

01:21:53.625 --> 01:21:56.999
I didn't know your son hadn't called.
I got in at 7...

01:21:57.166 --> 01:21:59.999
It's not your fault if...

01:22:01.166 --> 01:22:03.624
You're sure you won't come in?

01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:06.749
I don't know how

01:22:06.916 --> 01:22:08.665
to express my gratitude.

01:22:08.833 --> 01:22:12.290
It's nothing.
I'm sorry you had such a fright.

01:22:17.333 --> 01:22:18.790
Thanks again.

01:22:41.916 --> 01:22:43.624
Why don't you say anything?

01:22:45.875 --> 01:22:47.790
What's there to say?

01:22:49.041 --> 01:22:50.749
That's true.

01:23:05.958 --> 01:23:08.457
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:23:08.625 --> 01:23:10.082
Come on!

01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:11.457
What could be wrong?

01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:18.582
Why didn't you say you were staying
with this Francois guy?

01:23:20.791 --> 01:23:24.790
Didn't you think we'd be worried
if you just vanished?

01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:35.832
What's the problem, do you think?

01:23:37.458 --> 01:23:39.040
I don't know.

01:23:39.833 --> 01:23:42.290
Stop being so pig-headed!

01:23:42.458 --> 01:23:44.207
What's the problem?

01:23:54.708 --> 01:23:58.124
If you don't know,
I don't see what we can do about it.

01:24:02.458 --> 01:24:03.665
There is no problem!

01:24:03.833 --> 01:24:06.790
Why should there be one?
You know better than me.

01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:08.749
Leave me alone!

01:24:10.125 --> 01:24:12.374
What do you mean, I know better?

01:24:12.958 --> 01:24:14.040
Ask Pierre.

01:24:14.208 --> 01:24:15.915
He always knows everything!

01:24:18.916 --> 01:24:20.749
What are you trying to say?

01:24:21.958 --> 01:24:22.832
Nothing!

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.582
Why did you say it then?

01:24:26.041 --> 01:24:27.540
Are you jealous?

01:24:30.375 --> 01:24:32.457
What have you got into your head?

01:24:32.833 --> 01:24:35.415
That Pierre and me...
That's absurd!

01:24:35.583 --> 01:24:38.082
Because we call each other a lot?

01:24:38.541 --> 01:24:41.707
He's a friend.
A friend of mine and your Dad's.

01:24:41.875 --> 01:24:42.874
Why would you...

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.165
Stay here, I'm talking to you!

01:24:45.333 --> 01:24:48.999
Stop being so sullen.
You've no reason to act like that!

01:24:49.166 --> 01:24:50.957
Look at me, please!

01:24:53.625 --> 01:24:55.790
I swear you've got it wrong.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.499
I wonder
how you could even think that.

01:25:00.291 --> 01:25:01.665
I love you.

01:25:12.250 --> 01:25:14.582
Really... I love you.

01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:18.415
We were sick with worry
when you didn't come home.

01:25:19.041 --> 01:25:20.582
You find that so...

01:25:20.958 --> 01:25:22.332
So absurd?

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:26.332
Maybe we weren't sick but we freaked.
Because we love you.

01:25:53.041 --> 01:25:56.499
Tomorrow, I'm interviewing
the author of The Smart Gang.

01:25:56.666 --> 01:25:59.415
You loved the book,
if memory serves me right.

01:26:01.250 --> 01:26:05.082
If you give me your copy,
I'll ask him to sign it, OK?

01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:09.540
You'd like that?

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:16.915
Are you OK?

01:26:18.625 --> 01:26:20.415
I'm glad you're home.

01:26:25.375 --> 01:26:27.665
Using Berrichon as a pseudonym.

01:26:27.833 --> 01:26:31.040
Isabelle kept total control
over Rimbaud's work.

01:26:31.208 --> 01:26:33.415
- It was a money-spinner.
- That's right.

01:26:34.125 --> 01:26:36.124
She began to create this aura

01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:38.290
of a pious nun.

01:26:38.458 --> 01:26:41.665
Like a builder constructs a wall garden.

01:26:42.583 --> 01:26:45.915
Then, she began to meddle
with Rimbaud's work.

01:26:46.208 --> 01:26:49.915
We know that the poems
that shocked her went on the fire.

01:26:50.083 --> 01:26:53.624
I can agree with the portrait
you draw of Isabelle.

01:26:53.791 --> 01:26:56.957
It's the same as I had
before I began the book.

01:26:57.125 --> 01:26:59.915
We agree, both of us, on that point.

01:27:00.083 --> 01:27:02.707
At the same time,
I'd like to raise a few...

01:27:02.875 --> 01:27:05.165
Stop, it's getting too theoretical.

01:27:05.333 --> 01:27:07.332
Cut at "we agree on that point".

01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:10.499
And go to
when Teule talks about homosexuality.

01:27:10.666 --> 01:27:12.207
It's around...

01:27:13.875 --> 01:27:15.249
Around 30.

01:27:20.125 --> 01:27:22.832
- It wouldn't matter.
- It's poetic license.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.790
But I think Rimbaud is...

01:27:24.958 --> 01:27:27.124
On "I think" let's try

01:27:27.291 --> 01:27:28.415
slotting it in...

01:27:34.541 --> 01:27:35.915
What do you want now?

01:27:54.666 --> 01:27:56.124
What's going on?

01:27:56.666 --> 01:27:58.332
Thanks for coming.

01:27:59.708 --> 01:28:00.874
Come in.

01:28:12.083 --> 01:28:14.040
What's this all about?

01:28:15.708 --> 01:28:16.790
Sit down.

01:28:16.958 --> 01:28:18.874
No, I won't. What do you want?

01:28:19.041 --> 01:28:21.582
I truly had no idea about the tapes.

01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:23.457
Is that all?

01:28:24.375 --> 01:28:27.874
I called you
because I wanted you to be present...

01:31:44.083 --> 01:31:46.832
It's me.
please, try to get rid of them.

01:31:47.125 --> 01:31:50.415
I'm in the bedroom.
Something terrible's happened.

01:31:51.208 --> 01:31:53.207
I can't face them right now.

01:31:53.625 --> 01:31:55.290
Hurry, please.

01:32:47.875 --> 01:32:49.290
What's going on?

01:32:49.458 --> 01:32:51.249
Majid committed suicide.

01:32:51.708 --> 01:32:54.624
- I was there. He slit his throat.
- What?

01:32:55.166 --> 01:32:56.707
Yes, exactly.

01:32:58.166 --> 01:33:00.499
Sadly, it's no joke.

01:33:02.333 --> 01:33:03.957
What are you saying?

01:33:04.125 --> 01:33:06.332
I'm saying I was there.

01:33:06.666 --> 01:33:10.915
He asked me to come,
so he could explain about the tapes.

01:33:11.583 --> 01:33:13.874
- So I went.
- And?

01:33:15.208 --> 01:33:16.790
And nothing.

01:33:17.666 --> 01:33:20.832
He said, "I wanted you to be present"
and cut his throat.

01:33:26.208 --> 01:33:28.124
You can't be serious...

01:33:29.916 --> 01:33:32.707
Try to get rid of them.
We need to talk.

01:33:33.666 --> 01:33:35.499
What can I tell them?

01:33:35.791 --> 01:33:37.457
I don't know.

01:33:38.083 --> 01:33:40.290
What did you say when I called?

01:33:40.458 --> 01:33:43.707
That it was the anonymous caller
asking for you.

01:33:43.875 --> 01:33:45.124
- And?
- Nothing.

01:33:45.291 --> 01:33:47.749
I excused myself and left.

01:33:47.916 --> 01:33:49.165
I don't know.

01:33:49.958 --> 01:33:54.207
Tell them you don't feel well,
that pierrot's sick.

01:33:58.083 --> 01:33:59.457
please!

01:34:49.625 --> 01:34:51.874
- They're gone.
- I saw.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:55.874
Not the light.

01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:02.207
What did you tell them?

01:35:02.916 --> 01:35:04.999
That I'd lied to them.

01:35:05.416 --> 01:35:07.374
That it was you on the phone.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.915
That I had to meet you
because you had a problem.

01:35:11.083 --> 01:35:12.832
They didn't offer to come?

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.832
You want
a transcript of the conversation?

01:35:18.875 --> 01:35:20.290
Sorry.

01:35:39.416 --> 01:35:41.040
What happened?

01:35:45.250 --> 01:35:47.207
It's like I told you.

01:35:48.333 --> 01:35:51.249
I arrived. He asked me in
and killed himself.

01:35:53.708 --> 01:35:55.332
There was a lot of blood.

01:35:57.500 --> 01:35:59.040
Afterwards, I just ran.

01:36:00.750 --> 01:36:02.540
You went for help?

01:36:04.416 --> 01:36:05.832
Why not?

01:36:07.791 --> 01:36:10.040
No, he died immediately.

01:36:13.958 --> 01:36:15.790
What are you going to do?

01:36:21.083 --> 01:36:23.457
- Was anybody else around?
- No, why?

01:36:23.625 --> 01:36:25.082
Come on!

01:36:27.541 --> 01:36:29.332
What time did it happen?

01:36:31.458 --> 01:36:33.665
This afternoon around 4, I guess.

01:36:34.458 --> 01:36:37.040
So you went to the police or what?

01:36:37.791 --> 01:36:38.874
No.

01:36:39.833 --> 01:36:42.790
What have you been doing?
Where were you?

01:36:44.791 --> 01:36:46.249
Nowhere.

01:36:47.958 --> 01:36:49.415
In town.

01:37:04.791 --> 01:37:06.415
You'd better report it.

01:37:08.416 --> 01:37:11.040
If anyone saw you,
you'd be a suspect.

01:37:14.416 --> 01:37:16.832
Then he'd have gotten what he wanted.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.165
What?

01:37:18.333 --> 01:37:21.040
Do you have another explanation?

01:37:22.041 --> 01:37:23.374
What for?

01:37:23.708 --> 01:37:26.249
Why else did he ask me to come?

01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:37.249
What did you do to him?

01:37:38.625 --> 01:37:39.790
What?

01:37:41.875 --> 01:37:44.124
- When?
- Back then.

01:37:46.333 --> 01:37:48.415
It takes a really sick mind!

01:37:48.750 --> 01:37:51.707
First, he sends all those damn tapes.

01:37:53.041 --> 01:37:54.832
You remember the drawings?

01:37:55.083 --> 01:37:58.582
They must have been
some kind of forewarning, huh?

01:37:58.791 --> 01:37:59.790
Georges!

01:38:16.166 --> 01:38:18.874
I told Mom he coughed up blood.

01:38:20.958 --> 01:38:22.957
They didn't believe me, you see?

01:38:24.625 --> 01:38:27.790
The doctor examined him,
didn't find anything.

01:38:30.208 --> 01:38:32.124
He was an old fool.

01:38:32.750 --> 01:38:34.707
Our family doctor, see?

01:38:37.958 --> 01:38:41.915
Then I told him
Dad wanted him to kill the rooster.

01:38:43.875 --> 01:38:46.249
It was a cranky bird.

01:38:47.250 --> 01:38:50.124
Evil, always attacking us.

01:38:53.125 --> 01:38:54.624
And he did it.

01:38:56.333 --> 01:38:58.290
He cut its head off.

01:38:59.833 --> 01:39:01.415
The rooster flapped.

01:39:03.958 --> 01:39:06.165
Majid was covered in blood.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.957
I told them he did it to scare me.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.665
Slitting his own throat for that...

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.957
A heck of a twisted joke,
don't you think?

01:39:47.333 --> 01:39:49.499
What were they doing here?

01:39:50.166 --> 01:39:51.415
Who?

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.332
pierre and Mathilde.

01:39:55.166 --> 01:39:56.707
It was planned.

01:39:57.041 --> 01:39:58.999
We were going to watch your show.

01:40:02.791 --> 01:40:04.082
I'd forgotten.

01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:11.624
I thought they were in Corsica.

01:40:12.250 --> 01:40:13.832
Just one week.

01:40:14.958 --> 01:40:16.665
They got back yesterday.

01:40:34.916 --> 01:40:36.124
Hi, how are you?

01:40:36.291 --> 01:40:37.332
Fine. And you?

01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:39.082
I didn't forget your book.

01:40:39.250 --> 01:40:41.957
- I called but it's not arrived.
- There's no rush.

01:40:42.125 --> 01:40:44.207
Maybe it's in today's mail.

01:40:46.416 --> 01:40:49.582
- You saw Malembert?
- He'll bring you the file.

01:40:52.416 --> 01:40:55.124
- May I have a word, please?
- What do you want?

01:40:55.875 --> 01:40:57.374
I'd like to talk with you.

01:40:58.333 --> 01:41:00.374
I don't have time. Goodbye.

01:42:10.708 --> 01:42:12.124
What do you want?

01:42:13.291 --> 01:42:15.040
Why are you so scared, sir?

01:42:15.208 --> 01:42:17.290
What d'you want?
Why are you here?

01:42:17.458 --> 01:42:19.540
You'd have let me in your house?

01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:23.957
I've no time, I said.

01:42:24.125 --> 01:42:25.749
I don't believe you, sir.

01:42:27.041 --> 01:42:30.457
If you refuse to find time,
I'll create a real scene

01:42:30.625 --> 01:42:33.457
and tell people things
they shouldn't hear.

01:42:33.791 --> 01:42:35.582
I can't believe you'd want that.

01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:38.207
Is that a threat?
I have nothing to hide.

01:42:38.375 --> 01:42:39.457
Really?

01:42:48.916 --> 01:42:51.832
Young man,
your father's death must hurt

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.540
but I refuse
to be incriminated by you.

01:42:58.208 --> 01:42:59.665
Be right there.

01:43:00.875 --> 01:43:03.290
The police corroborated my statement.

01:43:03.458 --> 01:43:04.915
It was suicide.

01:43:05.083 --> 01:43:06.957
So, please, get out of my face.

01:43:10.416 --> 01:43:12.290
I'd advise you to desist

01:43:12.458 --> 01:43:14.874
from terrorizing us with stupid tapes.

01:43:15.041 --> 01:43:17.207
They were nothing to do with me.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.290
Before he died,
your father insisted it wasn't him.

01:43:24.458 --> 01:43:26.832
Believe what you want,
I'm not lying.

01:43:48.833 --> 01:43:50.832
I'd like to talk to you, please.

01:43:51.958 --> 01:43:55.582
I won't argue with you in public.
Say your piece and leave

01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:58.207
or I'll call the police
to get you ejected.

01:43:58.375 --> 01:44:01.165
You know you're not allowed in here.

01:44:01.333 --> 01:44:02.707
I'm listening.

01:44:02.875 --> 01:44:04.999
Why so testy?
What did I do to you?

01:44:05.166 --> 01:44:06.957
What did you do to me?

01:44:07.208 --> 01:44:10.540
You terrorize my family and me
with your damn tapes!

01:44:10.708 --> 01:44:12.749
I know you were behind them!

01:44:12.916 --> 01:44:15.207
Your father wasn't capable of that.

01:44:15.375 --> 01:44:17.207
Why would I do that, sir?

01:44:17.375 --> 01:44:20.957
Cut the dumbass politeness, OK?

01:44:23.375 --> 01:44:26.499
You deprived my father
of a good education.

01:44:26.666 --> 01:44:29.540
The orphanage teaches hatred
not politeness.

01:44:29.708 --> 01:44:31.915
But my father raised me well.

01:44:32.541 --> 01:44:34.457
I won't forget that for you.

01:44:35.916 --> 01:44:37.415
We're not finished.

01:44:37.583 --> 01:44:39.790
What do you want? A fight?

01:44:39.958 --> 01:44:41.374
If you insist.

01:44:41.541 --> 01:44:44.915
You're probably stronger than me.
Go ahead, hit me!

01:44:47.791 --> 01:44:49.040
Know what? You're sick.

01:44:49.958 --> 01:44:51.874
You're as sick as your father.

01:44:52.041 --> 01:44:54.749
I don't know
what dumb obsession he fed you

01:44:54.916 --> 01:44:56.999
but I can tell you this...

01:44:57.791 --> 01:45:00.124
you'll never give me a bad conscience

01:45:00.291 --> 01:45:03.624
about your father's sad or wrecked life.

01:45:04.250 --> 01:45:06.957
I'm not to blame!
Do you get that?

01:45:08.708 --> 01:45:13.624
If ever you try to hurt me or my family,
you'll regret it. I guarantee it.

01:45:13.791 --> 01:45:15.457
I'm sick of your crap!

01:45:17.041 --> 01:45:19.957
Threats...
You're very good at those.

01:45:22.250 --> 01:45:24.374
Do you expect me to apologize?

01:45:25.166 --> 01:45:26.374
To who?

01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:27.999
Me?

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.707
So what do you want?

01:45:32.375 --> 01:45:33.915
Nothing anymore.

01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:37.874
I wondered how it feels,
a man's life on your conscience.

01:45:38.041 --> 01:45:38.749
That's all.

01:45:40.125 --> 01:45:41.332
Now I know.

01:45:41.541 --> 01:45:43.540
Great, everything's OK then.

01:45:43.708 --> 01:45:45.332
Do you mind if I go now?

01:45:47.583 --> 01:45:48.874
Be my guest.

01:48:20.708 --> 01:48:22.915
Hi, how're things?

01:48:26.291 --> 01:48:29.749
I'm just calling to say
I'm going to bed.

01:48:31.125 --> 01:48:34.374
No, I came home early.

01:48:34.541 --> 01:48:38.040
I'm drained.
I must have picked up some kind of bug.

01:48:39.458 --> 01:48:41.457
No, please, not that.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.540
Anyway, I wasn't needed in the office.

01:48:44.666 --> 01:48:47.207
Everything's as good as it can be.

01:48:47.375 --> 01:48:49.124
I just feel wiped out.

01:48:50.458 --> 01:48:54.040
Don't wake me when you get in,
I've taken 2 pills.

01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:57.082
When's pierrot home?

01:48:58.666 --> 01:49:00.707
You'll be back by then.

01:49:01.541 --> 01:49:04.624
Tell him to go easy on his poor old Dad.

01:49:10.416 --> 01:49:11.207
I love you.

01:51:46.416 --> 01:51:47.915
Come back!

01:52:03.208 --> 01:52:04.832
Let go of me!

01:52:11.125 --> 01:52:12.749
I don't wanna go!

01:52:12.916 --> 01:52:14.374
Calm down!
