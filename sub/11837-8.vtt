00:01.635 --> 00:02.569
<i>BERLUTI: Previously</i>
<i>on</i> "The <i>Practice"...</i>

00:02.602 --> 00:04.805
You got fired
from your last firm

00:04.838 --> 00:05.971
for embezzling.
Allegedly.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.908
You threatened extortion
your first week here.

00:07.941 --> 00:09.643
That was an accident.
Break privilege,

00:09.676 --> 00:10.877
for which you almost
got disbarred.

00:10.911 --> 00:11.845
Horseshoes.

00:11.878 --> 00:14.080
FRUTT: Sleep with witnesses.
Just the one.

00:14.114 --> 00:16.783
You are seriously
self-destructive.

00:17.150 --> 00:18.619
Isn't everybody?

00:18.652 --> 00:20.721
The difficult thing
about firing him--

00:20.754 --> 00:22.923
Aside from him
being your friend...

00:22.956 --> 00:24.157
FRUTT: Is that, once again,

00:24.190 --> 00:25.726
he fell on the sword
for somebody else

00:25.759 --> 00:27.728
and he did save us

00:27.761 --> 00:29.530
from a malpractice judgment.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.297
And possibly expose us

00:31.331 --> 00:32.966
to something much worse.

00:32.999 --> 00:34.334
Ellenor said something about me

00:34.367 --> 00:35.468
being self-destructive,

00:35.502 --> 00:37.170
but I assure you,

00:37.203 --> 00:38.872
if I am unwittingly

00:38.905 --> 00:40.306
or unconsciously...

00:40.340 --> 00:42.208
trying to take anybody down,

00:42.242 --> 00:43.910
it isn't you...

00:43.944 --> 00:45.646
or this law firm.

00:48.381 --> 00:51.317
(siren wailing)

00:52.953 --> 00:53.620
Nothing?

00:54.521 --> 00:56.823
They just pulled the offer...
completely.

00:57.257 --> 00:58.391
On the eve of trial?

00:58.424 --> 01:00.601
Karen, it seems I've been duped.

01:01.668 --> 01:03.336
(sirens wailing)

01:03.369 --> 01:04.236
(engine revving)

01:04.269 --> 01:06.439
(tires screeching)

01:06.472 --> 01:09.408
(cars honking)

01:16.950 --> 01:18.218
The defendant's lawyer

01:18.251 --> 01:19.920
is known to be underhanded.

01:19.953 --> 01:21.655
I now think he...

01:21.688 --> 01:24.290
led me to believe they'd settle
only to string me along.

01:24.324 --> 01:27.260
(siren wailing)

01:28.829 --> 01:31.765
(tires screeching)

01:34.134 --> 01:36.469
OFFICER: Police, hold...
OFFICER: Freeze!

01:36.503 --> 01:37.170
OFFICER: Get him.

01:40.040 --> 01:41.441
We are very ready, Karen.

01:41.474 --> 01:42.809
This lawyer--

01:42.843 --> 01:45.111
it's a setback, no doubt,
but tomorrow,

01:45.145 --> 01:47.180
we are ready to proceed
with this trial.

01:47.881 --> 01:49.349
(door opens)

01:49.382 --> 01:50.517
TED: I need a lawyer!

01:50.551 --> 01:51.484
WILSON: Hold on a second.

01:51.518 --> 01:52.786
TED: Wait! I need Bobby.

01:52.819 --> 01:53.987
WILSON: Sir, you need to--
TED: Where is Bobby?

01:54.020 --> 01:55.055
What's going on?
TED: I need a lawyer.

01:55.088 --> 01:56.322
WILSON: It seems that
he needs Bobby.

01:56.356 --> 01:57.824
I could be mistaken.
TED: No. No. No...

01:57.858 --> 01:58.959
Sir, come here.
Ellenor,

01:58.992 --> 02:00.300
can you take Karen
into your office, please?

02:00.333 --> 02:01.535
TED: There's not much time.

02:02.368 --> 02:03.970
There's not much time.
All right.

02:05.539 --> 02:06.206
Take it.

02:07.808 --> 02:08.574
Take it.

02:10.009 --> 02:11.845
That's very kind,
but I already have a knife.

02:11.878 --> 02:12.746
Please, they'll be here
any second.

02:12.779 --> 02:14.480
I need you to--
OFFICER: All right. Go.

02:14.515 --> 02:16.216
Police! Freeze!
Get down now!

02:16.249 --> 02:17.483
WILSON: You get down!

02:17.517 --> 02:19.485
What the hell is this?
Where is he?

02:19.519 --> 02:21.154
What is going on here?

02:21.187 --> 02:22.355
Did anybody just come in here?

02:22.889 --> 02:24.324
Six people, in fact,

02:24.357 --> 02:25.191
dressed in blue.

02:25.726 --> 02:26.527
JONES: We're looking for a man,

02:26.560 --> 02:28.962
mid 30s, jeans,
blue jacket.

02:28.995 --> 02:29.763
He entered this building.

02:30.664 --> 02:31.565
Is he a criminal?

02:32.165 --> 02:33.700
He's a homicide suspect.

02:34.467 --> 02:36.503
SHORE: Homicide?

02:36.537 --> 02:38.905
My god, do you know
what you've done?

02:38.939 --> 02:41.441
We represent murderers here.

02:41.474 --> 02:44.277
It's quite possible
the man you speak of

02:44.310 --> 02:46.947
came into this building
to hire us.

02:47.480 --> 02:49.049
With the six of you,
guns out,

02:49.683 --> 02:50.617
now he'll never come in.

02:51.685 --> 02:53.820
You may very well
have cost us business, officer.

02:53.854 --> 02:55.722
Bad policemen, very bad.

02:58.158 --> 03:02.035
(music playing)

03:37.938 --> 03:39.105
You've gotta help me.

03:39.139 --> 03:41.007
Mr. Grayson, I already have.

03:41.041 --> 03:42.543
It's a miracle the police

03:42.576 --> 03:44.077
didn't insist
on searching the place,

03:44.110 --> 03:45.912
in which case--
I was hiding under the table.

03:45.946 --> 03:49.115
I appreciate that,
but trainees at the academy

03:49.149 --> 03:51.317
are now advised to look
under tables.

03:51.351 --> 03:53.353
It's been a giant leap
for law enforcement.

03:53.386 --> 03:55.689
Look, I'm just asking for you
to hold the knife.

03:56.022 --> 03:57.223
And as I've explained,

03:57.257 --> 03:58.592
I'm not permitted to do that.

03:58.625 --> 04:00.133
This would be considered
evidence.

04:00.166 --> 04:00.834
TED: Please.

04:01.635 --> 04:03.604
It's evil.
It makes me do things.

04:06.239 --> 04:08.875
Mr. Grayson,

04:08.909 --> 04:11.578
if we were to assume possession
of this weapon,

04:11.612 --> 04:14.080
and you were to be charged
with a crime,

04:14.114 --> 04:15.549
we would have an obligation,

04:15.582 --> 04:17.149
a legal obligation,

04:17.183 --> 04:18.519
to turn it over to the police.

04:18.552 --> 04:19.986
Look,

04:20.019 --> 04:21.021
I'm telling you.

04:22.656 --> 04:24.324
It's evil.

04:24.357 --> 04:25.926
It makes me do things.

04:29.329 --> 04:31.097
(sighs) You know what?

04:31.131 --> 04:32.733
Why don't you let me

04:32.766 --> 04:36.102
turn the evil knife
over to the police

04:36.135 --> 04:38.037
so that they might
incarcerate it?

04:38.071 --> 04:39.272
TED: No. They'll trace it to me.

04:39.305 --> 04:40.641
I'm not going to jail.

04:42.442 --> 04:44.678
I want it at a place
where the police can't get it.

04:46.179 --> 04:47.280
Where I can't get it.

04:51.518 --> 04:52.719
Would you excuse me
for a minute?

04:52.753 --> 04:54.020
Are you going to call
the police?

04:54.054 --> 04:55.255
No.

04:56.857 --> 04:59.192
I just want to discuss
this matter with my colleagues.

05:01.702 --> 05:02.636
I'll be right back.

05:06.573 --> 05:07.908
Did he kill somebody?

05:07.941 --> 05:08.742
Well, there's blood on it.

05:08.775 --> 05:09.576
I don't think he used it

05:09.610 --> 05:10.644
to puncture a tire.

05:10.677 --> 05:13.246
FRUTT: Why doesn't he just
throw it in a dumpster?

05:13.279 --> 05:14.280
That might make sense, Ellenor,

05:14.314 --> 05:16.316
but I can't counsel him
to do that,

05:16.349 --> 05:18.451
unless you'd like me to.
No.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.554
We can't advise
a destruction of evidence.

05:20.587 --> 05:22.422
Well, we can't keep it, Eugene.

05:22.455 --> 05:24.558
If he leaves with it,
he might kill again.

05:24.591 --> 05:25.391
It's evil.

05:27.427 --> 05:28.094
Excuse me.

05:30.196 --> 05:31.865
Thank you for your help.

05:31.898 --> 05:33.700
I'm gonna look
for another lawyer.

05:39.472 --> 05:40.907
(door opens)

05:40.941 --> 05:43.343
Well, it seems
we dodged a bullet.

05:46.446 --> 05:47.548
Yes.

05:48.381 --> 05:50.250
It seems so.

05:50.283 --> 05:53.186
(music playing)

05:58.224 --> 05:59.159
What are you doing?

06:01.034 --> 06:02.135
Getting back to work.

06:07.741 --> 06:09.109
We have a trial in the morning.

06:18.552 --> 06:19.720
You'll testify first,

06:19.753 --> 06:21.154
and then we'll be calling
our doctors.

06:21.588 --> 06:22.255
Okay.

06:23.056 --> 06:24.825
Just speak
from your heart, Karen.

06:24.858 --> 06:27.160
Emotion is the strongest part
of our case.

06:27.861 --> 06:29.930
We don't really have a case,
do we, Ellenor?

06:33.099 --> 06:34.100
Uh, counselor?

06:36.603 --> 06:37.571
Excuse me, please.

06:40.473 --> 06:42.175
I apologize for my client

06:42.208 --> 06:44.377
pulling the offer
last minute like that.

06:44.410 --> 06:46.146
Uh...

06:46.179 --> 06:47.447
we really didn't see it coming.

06:48.014 --> 06:48.782
Right.

06:50.350 --> 06:52.352
Three hundred thousand,
no admission of liability,

06:52.385 --> 06:53.954
sealed, we're done.

06:53.987 --> 06:55.656
We can get a drink,

06:55.689 --> 06:56.790
patch up our differences.

06:57.858 --> 06:59.893
I can't go $300,000,

06:59.926 --> 07:02.268
but how about zero?

07:02.302 --> 07:03.369
Does zero work for you?

07:05.438 --> 07:07.373
(elevator dings)

07:08.909 --> 07:09.843
WILSON: He's been arrested.

07:11.011 --> 07:12.979
Who?
Ted Grayson.

07:13.013 --> 07:13.814
Mr. Knife Man.

07:13.847 --> 07:15.481
The victim was a CPA

07:15.516 --> 07:16.817
stabbed in an alley.

07:16.850 --> 07:19.085
Witnesses evidently saw Teddy

07:19.119 --> 07:20.887
and reported his license plate.

07:20.921 --> 07:22.422
So they've got him in custody?

07:22.455 --> 07:25.191
WILSON: Yes, and he called
asking for you.

07:26.359 --> 07:28.529
It seems that he didn't find
other representation.

07:28.562 --> 07:29.796
Did they recover the knife?

07:29.830 --> 07:31.431
WILSON: No.
No sign of the knife.

07:33.166 --> 07:35.101
Okay, you might have to cover
the arraignment.

07:36.136 --> 07:37.003
I'm in trial here.

07:37.037 --> 07:38.004
But I'm not licensed.

07:38.038 --> 07:39.105
It's just an arraignment.

07:39.773 --> 07:41.542
Also, find out anything

07:41.575 --> 07:42.543
and everything you can

07:42.576 --> 07:43.844
about Mr. Grayson.

07:43.877 --> 07:44.645
Alan.

07:44.678 --> 07:45.345
SHORE: I'm coming.

07:45.779 --> 07:46.947
I'll see you at the arraignment.

07:52.886 --> 07:55.388
KAREN: My husband was very
depressed about his job.

07:55.421 --> 07:56.890
He...

07:56.923 --> 07:59.025
hated the insurance business
to begin with,

07:59.059 --> 08:00.867
and when his performance
declined,

08:00.901 --> 08:03.236
he just went into a tailspin.

08:03.704 --> 08:05.005
Did he get treatment?

08:05.038 --> 08:07.808
KAREN: Yes, he saw a doctor
who prescribed leretol,

08:07.841 --> 08:08.942
an antidepressant.

08:08.975 --> 08:10.010
FRUTT: Did that help?

08:10.043 --> 08:10.711
KAREN: No.

08:11.545 --> 08:13.046
Almost immediately
after taking it,

08:13.079 --> 08:15.782
he became more agitated,

08:15.816 --> 08:17.050
volatile.

08:17.751 --> 08:19.385
Uh, about a week
after he was on it,

08:19.419 --> 08:20.120
he struck me.

08:20.486 --> 08:21.788
He struck you?

08:21.822 --> 08:22.923
KAREN: Yes,

08:23.389 --> 08:24.725
which was so not him.

08:25.726 --> 08:26.492
Paul was--

08:27.728 --> 08:30.797
he never showed any signs
of being hostile,

08:30.831 --> 08:31.998
certainly not violent.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.167
What happened then?

08:34.200 --> 08:36.202
He started getting
into altercations at work

08:36.236 --> 08:39.972
and was subsequently fired.

08:40.006 --> 08:41.474
That's when he started--

08:42.775 --> 08:44.277
that's when he said
he wanted

08:44.310 --> 08:45.411
to kill his boss.

08:46.146 --> 08:48.114
Did you think
about calling the police?

08:48.915 --> 08:50.817
No.

08:50.851 --> 08:52.452
Because as I said,
I couldn't even fathom

08:52.485 --> 08:53.253
that he would--

08:55.522 --> 08:57.023
later that night, he...

08:58.859 --> 09:00.634
he turned the gun
on himself.

09:01.902 --> 09:03.837
And you blame the drug leretol?

09:04.470 --> 09:06.540
It transformed him from...

09:06.573 --> 09:08.474
a kind,

09:08.509 --> 09:09.810
docile man

09:09.843 --> 09:12.312
into a volatile,
violent person

09:12.345 --> 09:14.748
immediately after
he started taking it.

09:16.116 --> 09:17.784
I know it was the drug.

09:19.586 --> 09:22.322
Your husband was very depressed
over work?

09:22.355 --> 09:23.624
Yes.

09:23.657 --> 09:25.726
Depressed before taking
the leretol?

09:26.426 --> 09:27.628
Yes, but he--
COLBY: Thank you.

09:27.661 --> 09:29.530
Did he ever hurt anybody

09:29.563 --> 09:31.297
after taking the drug leretol?

09:31.698 --> 09:33.133
He struck me once.

09:33.466 --> 09:34.300
He struck you?

09:34.868 --> 09:35.869
With his fist,

09:35.902 --> 09:36.970
open hand?

09:37.237 --> 09:38.171
Open hand.

09:38.639 --> 09:39.506
Were you injured?

09:40.006 --> 09:41.074
Physically, no,

09:41.107 --> 09:41.842
but my children--
Thank you.

09:41.875 --> 09:43.143
Did he tell you

09:43.176 --> 09:45.512
that he purchased a gun

09:45.546 --> 09:47.714
to shoot his employer?
No.

09:47.748 --> 09:49.415
He said he bought it
for personal protection,

09:49.449 --> 09:50.984
but this--
Which you had encouraged,

09:51.818 --> 09:53.820
am I right?
There had been a rash

09:53.854 --> 09:55.221
of break-ins
in your neighborhood?

09:55.656 --> 09:56.990
Yes.

09:57.023 --> 09:59.225
But he was talking
about committing murder.

09:59.259 --> 10:00.500
That isn't personal
protection.

10:00.534 --> 10:03.236
Just so that we're clear.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.772
He bought the gun
for personal protection,

10:05.806 --> 10:07.140
and he became very depressed,

10:07.173 --> 10:08.542
then he turned the gun
on himself.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.677
He turned the gun
on himself

10:10.711 --> 10:12.879
after consuming
your client's product.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.681
COLBY: Your husband's
life insurance

10:14.715 --> 10:16.082
doesn't cover suicide,

10:16.116 --> 10:17.584
does it, Ms. Evanson?

10:18.652 --> 10:20.821
With inexplicable tragedies,

10:20.854 --> 10:22.956
people often find a need

10:22.989 --> 10:25.491
to assess blame...

10:25.526 --> 10:27.227
and sometimes, they...

10:27.260 --> 10:28.629
have the need to find money.

10:28.662 --> 10:30.531
Objection.
Withdrawn.

10:31.532 --> 10:33.333
Tell me, Ms. Evanson,

10:34.034 --> 10:36.202
why didn't you just sue
the doctor

10:36.236 --> 10:37.571
who prescribed the medication?

10:40.073 --> 10:41.041
Pockets not deep enough?

10:41.074 --> 10:42.976
Objection.
Sustained.

10:45.111 --> 10:46.246
Nothing further.

11:02.102 --> 11:03.504
TED: I didn't do it,

11:03.537 --> 11:04.571
I promise you.

11:04.605 --> 11:07.107
Can you tell me why you
were spotted in the area?

11:07.140 --> 11:09.109
I was there,
but it wasn't me.

11:09.610 --> 11:10.343
Who was it, then?

11:10.376 --> 11:12.345
It was--
it was the knife.

11:13.279 --> 11:14.047
The knife.

11:15.048 --> 11:16.449
I don't deny
that it was in my hand,

11:16.482 --> 11:18.885
but I swear,
all I meant to do

11:18.919 --> 11:21.087
was to threaten him
to get money.

11:22.889 --> 11:24.457
This knife is evil.

11:24.490 --> 11:26.159
It's done this before.

11:26.627 --> 11:27.894
The knife has killed before?

11:27.928 --> 11:30.030
It's tried, yeah,

11:30.063 --> 11:31.231
which is the reason

11:31.264 --> 11:32.733
I can't have it in my hand.

11:34.500 --> 11:35.869
You know where it is,
don't you?

11:35.902 --> 11:39.239
If I were to know
where it is, Mr. Grayson,

11:39.272 --> 11:41.942
I would be duty bound to tell.

11:41.975 --> 11:43.076
Let's not have me know.

11:43.577 --> 11:44.645
Are we clear?

11:46.580 --> 11:47.581
Listen,

11:47.948 --> 11:50.951
you talk to nobody...

11:50.984 --> 11:53.520
other than my assistant,

11:53.554 --> 11:56.389
Tara Wilson...

11:56.422 --> 11:57.123
and me.

12:00.300 --> 12:01.702
This is important.

12:03.336 --> 12:04.104
Okay.

12:06.106 --> 12:07.941
Two robberies
and one prior assault.

12:07.974 --> 12:11.111
On each occasion,
he claims to have heard voices.

12:11.144 --> 12:13.413
He's been fired from every job
he's ever had.

12:13.446 --> 12:14.681
What's his diagnosis?

12:15.148 --> 12:16.149
He's never been treated.

12:17.217 --> 12:18.251
I beg your pardon?

12:18.284 --> 12:19.119
WILSON: For his prior crimes,

12:19.152 --> 12:21.187
they just threw him into prison.

12:21.221 --> 12:22.255
I talked to his mother.

12:22.288 --> 12:23.524
She says that he's been crazy

12:23.557 --> 12:24.457
since he was three.

12:24.490 --> 12:26.359
Apparently she couldn't
afford a doctor,

12:26.392 --> 12:28.228
but that's a little unclear
because she seems

12:28.261 --> 12:29.429
fairly unstable herself.

12:29.796 --> 12:30.697
Are you telling me this man

12:30.731 --> 12:31.965
has never been treated...

12:31.998 --> 12:32.766
ever?

12:36.336 --> 12:38.104
I don't prescribe
leretol anymore.

12:38.138 --> 12:39.806
But you did
with Paul Evanson.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.208
BERNARD: Yes,
but after his suicide,

12:42.242 --> 12:43.710
I began to dig around

12:43.744 --> 12:45.912
and uncovered anecdotal evidence

12:45.946 --> 12:47.514
of patients becoming
violent.

12:47.948 --> 12:49.683
FRUTT: Doctor,
after Paul Evanson

12:49.716 --> 12:52.118
started taking the drug,

12:52.152 --> 12:53.053
what did you observe?

12:53.086 --> 12:55.989
He definitely became
more agitated,

12:56.022 --> 12:57.457
erratic.

12:57.490 --> 13:00.026
I didn't suspect the drug
until it was too late.

13:01.001 --> 13:04.270
COLBY: In your patient notes,
you never describe Mr. Evanson

13:04.304 --> 13:06.039
as becoming more violent.

13:06.072 --> 13:08.074
I believe I noted the agitation,

13:08.108 --> 13:10.511
as well as--
COLBY: Did you ever observe

13:10.544 --> 13:11.978
any acts of violence?

13:12.613 --> 13:14.247
No.
COLBY: As a matter of fact,

13:14.280 --> 13:17.518
you attributed
his increased agitation

13:17.551 --> 13:19.319
to his depression,
his despondency

13:19.352 --> 13:21.387
over his job,
did you not, doctor?

13:21.421 --> 13:22.889
I changed my position on that

13:22.923 --> 13:24.758
after uncovering
the anecdotal evidence.

13:24.791 --> 13:25.692
Anecdotal evidence.

13:25.726 --> 13:28.194
How many instances
did you uncover

13:28.228 --> 13:30.731
where leretol caused
the patient

13:30.764 --> 13:32.699
to become more violent?
Thirty-three.

13:32.733 --> 13:33.900
Thirty-three,

13:33.934 --> 13:37.203
and in those thirty-three cases,

13:37.237 --> 13:39.673
how many stated
to a medical conclusion

13:39.706 --> 13:42.075
that leretol was the cause
of the violence?

13:42.108 --> 13:43.844
None were medical conclusions

13:43.877 --> 13:45.045
because--
Thank you, doctor.

13:45.078 --> 13:47.047
Wait, I would like to finish.

13:49.449 --> 13:50.250
Go ahead.

13:50.751 --> 13:51.752
BERNARD: In all of those cases,

13:51.785 --> 13:54.220
there were other variables
which prevented

13:54.254 --> 13:55.388
a conclusive finding,

13:55.421 --> 13:57.824
but leretol
was the common denominator

13:57.858 --> 13:59.826
and in each case,
it was cited

13:59.860 --> 14:01.101
as the likely cause.

14:01.134 --> 14:04.104
COLBY: How many times,
in your best estimate,

14:04.137 --> 14:05.872
has leretol been prescribed?

14:07.040 --> 14:08.474
Thousands.
COLBY: Perhaps hundreds

14:08.509 --> 14:10.343
of thousands?
Yes.

14:10.376 --> 14:13.079
COLBY: And with these hundreds
of thousands of usages,

14:13.113 --> 14:15.716
you were able to find...

14:15.749 --> 14:17.684
thirty-three.

14:17.718 --> 14:19.385
None of which...

14:19.419 --> 14:22.122
conclusively found a nexus

14:22.155 --> 14:24.490
between leretol and violence,

14:24.525 --> 14:26.426
is that correct, doctor?
Correct.

14:26.459 --> 14:28.562
How many studies
are you aware of, doctor,

14:28.595 --> 14:30.797
that conclude the drug
is unsafe?

14:30.831 --> 14:33.399
None, but--
How many studies are you aware

14:33.433 --> 14:34.935
that conclude the drug
is safe?

14:34.968 --> 14:39.806
Many, most funded by
the manufacturer, your client.

14:39.840 --> 14:43.209
Do you have evidence
to suggest...

14:43.243 --> 14:45.679
that these studies
were not conducted fairly?

14:46.980 --> 14:48.148
No.

14:49.683 --> 14:52.252
SHORE: The problem is we have
no scientific evidence.

14:52.285 --> 14:54.087
Even if we could prove

14:54.120 --> 14:55.689
the drug was unsafe,

14:55.722 --> 14:58.291
proving it's
unreasonably unsafe,

14:58.324 --> 15:00.100
given the good it's done
to many people--

15:00.133 --> 15:02.068
What about
the negligence theory?

15:02.102 --> 15:03.704
FRUTT: The problem there is--

15:03.737 --> 15:04.671
there's nothing to show

15:04.705 --> 15:05.972
they could foresee any danger.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.310
We barely survived
summary judgment.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.445
What are you asking me
to do here?

15:13.146 --> 15:16.850
It's not like I have an offer
to accept.

15:16.883 --> 15:18.318
What am I supposed to do?

15:18.752 --> 15:20.086
Nothing.

15:20.120 --> 15:23.056
I guess...

15:23.089 --> 15:24.190
we're just bracing you.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.596
You said you'd get something.

15:31.565 --> 15:34.300
I thought we would.

15:34.334 --> 15:36.670
KAREN: I have no money, okay?

15:36.703 --> 15:38.539
It's like he said,

15:38.572 --> 15:40.240
insurance doesn't cover suicide.

15:41.675 --> 15:43.343
I have three children
to raise.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.149
I have three kids.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.117
(sighs)

15:54.921 --> 15:56.122
We waive reading,
Your Honor,

15:56.156 --> 15:58.358
and request
a probable-cause hearing.

15:58.391 --> 15:59.993
We'd also ask
for a reasonable bail.

16:00.026 --> 16:01.401
WHITE: Excuse me, Ms. Wilson,

16:01.434 --> 16:03.737
but I'm informed you're not
a member of the bar.

16:03.770 --> 16:05.371
WILSON: I'm only here
to enter a plea

16:05.405 --> 16:06.707
and to file Alan Shore's
appearance.

16:06.740 --> 16:08.241
SHORE: No need,
Your Honor, I'm here.

16:08.274 --> 16:08.942
What did I miss?

16:09.643 --> 16:10.443
WHITE: Mr. Shore.

16:11.011 --> 16:12.345
This is a homicide case.

16:12.378 --> 16:13.580
You had better things to do?

16:13.614 --> 16:14.515
SHORE: Actually, I was searching

16:14.548 --> 16:15.582
for the real killer,
Your Honor,

16:15.616 --> 16:16.282
with O. J.

16:19.686 --> 16:20.854
Probable-cause hearing

16:20.887 --> 16:23.256
is scheduled
for tomorrow, 10:00.

16:23.289 --> 16:24.991
MARTIN: Your honor,
before we adjourn,

16:25.025 --> 16:26.426
we have a subpoena
for Mr. Shore.

16:27.594 --> 16:29.596
Mr. Grayson was pursued
by the police

16:29.630 --> 16:31.532
into Mr. Shore's building
tuesday night.

16:31.965 --> 16:33.199
Mr. Shore denied
to the police

16:33.233 --> 16:35.068
that the suspect
entered his office.

16:35.101 --> 16:38.104
Today, by the most stunning
of coincidences,

16:38.138 --> 16:40.140
we find Mr. Shore representing
the defendant.

16:40.173 --> 16:41.374
SHORE: Your Honor,
I have no obligation

16:41.407 --> 16:42.743
to tell the police anything
about a client,

16:42.776 --> 16:44.077
so--
We believe Mr. Shore

16:44.110 --> 16:45.812
may have information
as to the whereabouts

16:45.846 --> 16:46.747
of the murder weapon.

16:46.780 --> 16:49.315
Mr. Grayson was overheard
talking in jail

16:49.349 --> 16:51.585
about an evil knife
that was in his lawyer's office.

16:51.618 --> 16:52.919
Overheard?
Where was that,

16:52.953 --> 16:53.887
standing around
the water cooler?

16:55.055 --> 16:55.822
Chambers.

17:01.101 --> 17:02.736
What did we say
about talking, Ted?

17:07.708 --> 17:09.275
Do you have
the murder weapon, counsel?

17:09.309 --> 17:11.310
We don't admit
there was a murder, Your Honor,

17:11.344 --> 17:12.913
and if there was,

17:12.945 --> 17:14.414
we don't admit
that it was accomplished

17:14.446 --> 17:15.115
with a knife.

17:15.516 --> 17:16.950
And if it was,

17:16.983 --> 17:19.252
we don't admit the knife exists

17:19.285 --> 17:20.420
and if it does,

17:20.453 --> 17:22.522
we don't admit that we have it.

17:22.556 --> 17:24.657
You don't have the right
to conceal evidence.

17:24.691 --> 17:27.027
I have the duty
not to incriminate my client.

17:27.060 --> 17:29.195
We're asking for evidence,
not testimony.

17:29.229 --> 17:30.997
The case law says

17:31.031 --> 17:33.867
a defendant cannot be forced
by subpoena

17:33.900 --> 17:34.968
to turn over a weapon.

17:35.001 --> 17:36.737
But we can force the lawyer.

17:38.939 --> 17:41.107
Do you have the knife,
Mr. Shore?

17:41.141 --> 17:42.108
Frisk me.

17:42.809 --> 17:44.310
Is the knife in your office?

17:44.344 --> 17:45.512
I don't know.

17:45.779 --> 17:46.947
You don't know.

17:46.980 --> 17:48.582
If there is a knife,
Your Honor,

17:48.615 --> 17:50.817
and I'm not saying there is,

17:50.851 --> 17:52.919
I have no actual

17:52.953 --> 17:55.388
or constructive knowledge

17:55.421 --> 17:56.890
as to its whereabouts.

18:00.934 --> 18:01.702
Do you have it?

18:01.735 --> 18:02.903
I do not.

18:03.403 --> 18:04.104
Where is it?

18:06.072 --> 18:07.808
It may be in the conference room

18:09.275 --> 18:12.345
so I would encourage us all
not to go in there because...

18:12.378 --> 18:14.615
if we have actual knowledge

18:14.648 --> 18:15.949
that it's in our possession,

18:15.982 --> 18:17.283
we, of course,
would have a duty

18:17.317 --> 18:19.019
to turn it over.

18:19.886 --> 18:21.021
BERLUTI: So, what,

18:21.054 --> 18:22.388
you're going, "Wink, wink,"

18:22.422 --> 18:24.424
and pretending you don't know?

18:24.725 --> 18:26.159
I don't know, Jimmy,

18:26.192 --> 18:27.227
not for a fact.

18:27.260 --> 18:29.462
STRINGER: And you're purposely
not looking for it.

18:29.495 --> 18:30.196
SHORE: Exactly.

18:30.230 --> 18:31.497
Ignorance is not only bliss,

18:31.532 --> 18:33.667
it happens to be constitutional.

18:35.135 --> 18:36.503
(door opens)

18:36.537 --> 18:37.538
Alan.
SHORE: Mike.

18:37.571 --> 18:38.605
Hello.

18:38.639 --> 18:39.640
Thanks for coming.

18:39.673 --> 18:41.474
Um, would you excuse me, please?

18:42.709 --> 18:43.877
Right this way, Mike.

18:49.816 --> 18:52.285
I do not approve
of this person.

18:54.154 --> 18:55.756
MICHAEL: Could you do me a favor
and call me Michael

18:55.789 --> 18:56.923
in front of other people?

18:56.957 --> 18:58.659
I'm trying to come off,
you know,

18:58.692 --> 18:59.526
more respectful.

18:59.560 --> 19:01.134
Respectable. Certainly.

19:02.636 --> 19:03.904
Well, what can I do for you?

19:03.937 --> 19:07.440
I'd like to avail myself
of your silent deploy program.

19:08.241 --> 19:10.577
Is this for something illegal?

19:10.611 --> 19:12.879
SHORE: Michael, how could you
ask me such a thing?

19:12.913 --> 19:15.616
MICHAEL: Uh, yeah.

19:15.649 --> 19:16.650
You got the email address?

19:16.683 --> 19:17.718
I have several.

19:18.852 --> 19:20.220
I mean, how illegal is it,

19:20.253 --> 19:21.955
what we're planning to do here?

19:21.988 --> 19:23.857
SHORE: Michael,

19:23.890 --> 19:24.758
you know me.

19:33.700 --> 19:35.602
Just stall them
for as long as you can.

19:35.636 --> 19:36.770
WILSON: Stall them?
But he didn't like

19:36.803 --> 19:37.638
that you were late
the last time.

19:37.671 --> 19:39.139
I'll be there.
What's going on?

19:39.172 --> 19:40.774
Ellenor, I have marvelous news.

19:41.742 --> 19:42.909
They're suddenly offering
to settle?

19:42.943 --> 19:44.578
Not yet, but they will.

19:44.611 --> 19:47.047
Mr. Colby is in your office
as we speak.

19:47.080 --> 19:48.749
Off you go, Tara.
I'll be there shortly.

19:49.015 --> 19:50.116
He's in my office.

19:50.150 --> 19:51.451
I think you'll be very pleased.
Let's go.

19:58.258 --> 20:00.066
If this is a waste
of my time...

20:00.100 --> 20:01.434
I assure you it isn't.

20:01.467 --> 20:03.136
I'm doing you a favor,
Mr. Colby.

20:03.169 --> 20:05.238
You'll perhaps want to buy me
that drink after all.

20:05.939 --> 20:07.574
I'm not a morning person.

20:07.608 --> 20:09.109
SHORE: Yes.

20:09.142 --> 20:11.044
I was going through
the voluminous discovery

20:11.077 --> 20:13.947
late last night,
and I found this included

20:13.980 --> 20:16.216
among the multitude
of various...

20:16.249 --> 20:17.317
medical studies.

20:18.184 --> 20:19.052
It's quite helpful,

20:19.085 --> 20:21.888
though not to you.

20:23.256 --> 20:24.390
What is this?

20:24.424 --> 20:25.158
SHORE: It's a letter.

20:25.191 --> 20:27.427
Addressed to you,
in fact,

20:27.460 --> 20:30.063
from your client
concerning leretol,

20:31.131 --> 20:32.833
acknowledging a small percentage

20:32.866 --> 20:35.435
of violent ideations

20:35.468 --> 20:37.103
and suicidal tendencies.

20:40.574 --> 20:43.844
Tick, tick, boom.

20:48.114 --> 20:49.015
How did you get this?

20:49.049 --> 20:50.684
I just told you.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.085
This is from general counsel...

20:52.118 --> 20:54.154
to me.

20:54.821 --> 20:55.922
It's work product.

20:56.489 --> 20:57.991
We never turn this over.

20:58.024 --> 20:58.659
You must have.

20:58.692 --> 20:59.760
I have it.

20:59.793 --> 21:01.434
I asked you a question before.

21:03.203 --> 21:04.671
How did you get this?

21:04.705 --> 21:07.240
Your client acknowledged
a violent,

21:07.273 --> 21:08.975
possibly suicidal nexus

21:09.009 --> 21:10.677
between the drug--
This is privileged.

21:10.711 --> 21:12.478
Gee.

21:12.513 --> 21:14.447
If you're right,
it would be malpractice then,

21:14.480 --> 21:16.517
for you to give it to me, ouch.

21:16.917 --> 21:18.251
And your reputation has been

21:18.284 --> 21:20.053
so spotless to now.

21:21.421 --> 21:23.323
$2 million, Robert.

21:23.356 --> 21:24.190
You don't want the jury

21:24.224 --> 21:25.325
to hear that your people knew

21:25.358 --> 21:27.828
about the inherent dangers.

21:27.861 --> 21:29.229
Think of the punitives,
Robert.

21:29.262 --> 21:31.231
(sighs) This is inadmissible.

21:31.264 --> 21:34.434
I'm bringing a motion
in limine to quash it.

21:35.836 --> 21:37.538
And I will not
be blackmailed.

21:37.571 --> 21:38.271
Hmm.

21:38.304 --> 21:39.706
Strategic mistake.

21:47.313 --> 21:48.882
Alan, where did you get
that document?

21:48.915 --> 21:52.519
I'm late for a probable-cause
hearing on Mr. Knife.

21:52.553 --> 21:53.887
I'd love it
if you could start

21:53.920 --> 21:55.956
to prepare our response
to Mr. Colby's motion.

21:55.989 --> 21:56.923
Could you help me on that?

21:58.725 --> 22:00.667
(door closes)

22:00.701 --> 22:02.035
(sighs)

22:02.068 --> 22:03.604
I saw him running.

22:03.637 --> 22:04.738
The defendant?

22:04.771 --> 22:05.506
WOMAN: Yes.

22:05.539 --> 22:06.673
He jumped into his car

22:06.707 --> 22:07.741
and he just sped off.

22:07.774 --> 22:09.242
MARTIN: Are you absolutely sure

22:09.275 --> 22:10.877
that this is the man
you saw running?

22:11.678 --> 22:12.412
Yes.

22:13.446 --> 22:15.015
SHORE: Did you see him
run out of the alley

22:15.048 --> 22:16.249
or simply on the street?

22:16.282 --> 22:18.018
Just on the street.

22:18.051 --> 22:19.686
And when the police
pulled up seconds later,

22:19.720 --> 22:21.454
you said, "That's him
in that car."?

22:21.487 --> 22:23.624
WOMAN: Yes, and they took off
after him.

22:23.657 --> 22:25.358
And when you said,
"That's him,"

22:25.391 --> 22:28.228
why did you think
the police wanted him?

22:29.062 --> 22:31.331
WOMAN: Well,
because he was running away.

22:31.364 --> 22:33.133
So when the police screeched up,

22:33.166 --> 22:34.535
I put two and two together.

22:34.568 --> 22:36.336
Ah, two and two.

22:37.771 --> 22:38.739
SMITH:
We entered his apartment,

22:38.772 --> 22:40.741
he immediately tried to flee.

22:40.774 --> 22:42.208
He shouted, "It wasn't me."

22:42.242 --> 22:43.744
"It wasn't me."

22:43.777 --> 22:45.111
SMITH: We apprehended him,

22:45.145 --> 22:47.013
we noticed a bruise on his face.

22:47.047 --> 22:49.315
We also found
$700 in cash

22:49.349 --> 22:50.551
on his kitchen table.

22:51.952 --> 22:53.620
A bruise and money,
is that all?

22:53.654 --> 22:56.089
That and a prior record
for armed robberies.

22:56.489 --> 22:57.958
I see. Did that factor

22:57.991 --> 22:58.792
into your making
the arrest,

22:58.825 --> 22:59.593
his prior record?

22:59.626 --> 23:00.567
Yes.

23:00.601 --> 23:02.168
Your Honor, at this time,

23:02.202 --> 23:03.937
I ask that you dismiss
the charges

23:03.970 --> 23:05.806
with prejudice and an apology.

23:06.439 --> 23:07.874
You can step down, officer.

23:10.276 --> 23:11.745
Do you have anything else?

23:11.778 --> 23:13.179
Your Honor,
the suspect's prior record

23:13.213 --> 23:14.881
can factor
into reasonable suspicion.

23:14.915 --> 23:15.916
Perhaps to search him.

23:15.949 --> 23:17.618
MARTIN: He was spotted
running from the scene.

23:17.651 --> 23:19.419
He then ran from the police.

23:19.452 --> 23:21.454
The prosecution has no case.

23:21.487 --> 23:25.125
Running down a street
is not evidence of a murder.

23:25.158 --> 23:26.126
You don't even have enough

23:26.159 --> 23:27.761
to call him a person
of interest.

23:27.794 --> 23:29.596
I could be wrong on that.

23:29.630 --> 23:30.797
WHITE: All right, look,

23:30.831 --> 23:33.399
there are several issues
in play here.

23:33.433 --> 23:35.368
I'm going to take this
under advisement.

23:35.401 --> 23:37.738
We'll reconvene at 3:00.

23:37.771 --> 23:38.939
(gavel bangs)

23:40.541 --> 23:41.875
What does that mean?

23:41.908 --> 23:43.343
It means he's gonna
think about it.

23:43.877 --> 23:45.045
In the meantime,

23:45.078 --> 23:48.214
you do not speak to anybody.

23:48.248 --> 23:50.050
Okay. It's just
that sometimes

23:50.083 --> 23:50.951
it helps for me to talk.

23:50.984 --> 23:52.185
You cannot do that.

23:55.321 --> 23:57.524
Ted, if I succeed

23:57.558 --> 23:59.359
in keeping you out of prison,

23:59.392 --> 24:02.636
I need you to promise me
you'll go to a hospital.

24:02.669 --> 24:04.337
A mental hospital?

24:04.370 --> 24:05.972
We need to make you safe

24:06.006 --> 24:07.908
(Ted sighs)
from the voices...

24:10.076 --> 24:11.244
...from the knife.

24:21.187 --> 24:22.656
COLBY: I don't know
how he got it,

24:22.689 --> 24:24.090
but clearly, it's privileged.

24:24.124 --> 24:26.593
It's not discoverable.

24:26.627 --> 24:27.661
And for it to be admitted--

24:27.694 --> 24:28.762
You disclosed it?

24:28.795 --> 24:30.496
He's saying we did.

24:30.531 --> 24:31.898
It's my suspicion, however--

24:31.932 --> 24:34.034
How did you get
the letter, Mr. Shore?

24:34.067 --> 24:35.401
Discovery.

24:35.435 --> 24:37.538
FRUTT: Your Honor,
even if you were to find

24:37.571 --> 24:39.372
this correspondence
to be work product,

24:39.405 --> 24:42.175
the opinion has to be
based on some study.

24:42.208 --> 24:44.144
Why wasn't that study
turned over to us?

24:46.647 --> 24:47.714
I don't know.

24:47.748 --> 24:49.816
You don't know.

24:49.850 --> 24:51.451
Did you ask general counsel?

24:51.484 --> 24:52.452
No.

24:54.020 --> 24:55.321
Because what you don't know
helps you.

24:56.823 --> 24:58.158
This is a letter written

24:58.191 --> 25:00.901
from lawyer to lawyer,

25:00.934 --> 25:02.903
black and white, work product.

25:02.936 --> 25:04.905
I am more troubled
by your client

25:04.938 --> 25:05.806
concealing evidence.

25:07.841 --> 25:10.210
I don't know what you do
and don't have, Mr. Colby,

25:10.243 --> 25:12.112
but the letter is admitted.

25:15.015 --> 25:17.651
Now might be
a good time to chat.

25:21.855 --> 25:23.524
What's going on?

25:23.557 --> 25:25.859
Opposing counsel is meeting
with the defendant.

25:25.892 --> 25:27.794
We're expecting
an offer at 2:00.

25:27.828 --> 25:28.695
Really?

25:28.729 --> 25:29.730
Well, that's fantastic.

25:29.763 --> 25:31.397
Yes, it is.

25:31.431 --> 25:34.000
Alan, can I talk to you
for a second?

25:36.036 --> 25:37.003
Well, not in that room.

25:37.037 --> 25:38.338
It might contain evil.

25:38.371 --> 25:40.040
(Frutt sighs)

25:40.073 --> 25:41.642
My office.

25:45.679 --> 25:47.113
Where did you get
that document?

25:48.214 --> 25:49.783
(door closes)

25:49.816 --> 25:50.684
You don't wanna know.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.553
Damn it, Alan,

25:52.586 --> 25:54.054
I've had enough
of not knowing.

25:56.857 --> 25:58.058
You and I are friends,

25:58.091 --> 25:59.526
in addition
to being colleagues,

25:59.560 --> 26:01.835
so I am asking you
to be straight with me.

26:04.671 --> 26:06.472
Where did you get it?

26:07.608 --> 26:10.844
There's a software program
called Silent Deploy.

26:10.877 --> 26:13.146
Basically, you can target
somebody else's computer.

26:13.179 --> 26:14.815
All you need
is their e-mail address.

26:16.416 --> 26:18.318
I went into Mr. Colby's
computer last night

26:18.351 --> 26:19.352
and hit pay dirt.

26:21.354 --> 26:23.123
You broke
into somebody's computer

26:23.156 --> 26:25.659
and you stole
their private correspondence?

26:25.692 --> 26:26.693
I feel ashamed.

26:27.160 --> 26:28.895
But compared
to concealing evidence

26:28.929 --> 26:30.396
that a drug
is potentially lethal--

26:30.430 --> 26:32.398
Alan,

26:32.432 --> 26:33.333
I don't even know

26:33.366 --> 26:34.801
what to do with you!

26:34.835 --> 26:37.437
SHORE: Ellenor,
you are my friend.

26:37.470 --> 26:39.840
I want you to be a friend
to Karen Evanson here.

26:41.074 --> 26:44.044
If you insist on exalting
your ethical duties

26:44.077 --> 26:45.311
as a member of the bar,

26:45.345 --> 26:47.380
I need you to excuse yourself
from this case.

26:48.248 --> 26:49.049
Why?

26:49.082 --> 26:50.851
Because swiping this document

26:50.884 --> 26:52.318
is just the beginning.

26:55.789 --> 26:57.991
What are you gonna do now?

27:13.146 --> 27:14.180
I can't urge you enough

27:14.214 --> 27:15.481
not to be present
for this.

27:15.516 --> 27:17.884
Oh, I will be
very present.

27:17.918 --> 27:20.453
In that case, I need you
to make me a promise.

27:21.354 --> 27:22.222
What?

27:22.255 --> 27:23.557
Don't speak.

27:24.691 --> 27:26.259
If I have something
to say, Alan--

27:26.292 --> 27:30.263
You'll have nothing helpful
to say in that room.

27:33.767 --> 27:35.301
(elevator dings)

27:37.638 --> 27:38.639
RECEPTIONIST:
I'm sorry, can I--

27:38.672 --> 27:40.240
I know where the room is.
Thank you.

27:54.320 --> 27:55.388
Who are these people?

27:56.089 --> 27:57.423
Members of my firm.

27:57.457 --> 27:58.625
Excuse them.

27:59.425 --> 28:00.834
They're part of my legal team.

28:00.867 --> 28:02.135
Excuse them.

28:04.538 --> 28:06.006
It's all right,
you can go.

28:07.073 --> 28:08.241
Thank you.

28:20.386 --> 28:21.855
I presume you have a number.

28:21.888 --> 28:24.057
$1.3, sealed.

28:24.090 --> 28:24.858
No admission.

28:24.891 --> 28:27.493
Very nice.

28:27.528 --> 28:29.830
But for a billion-dollar
pharmaceutical company?

28:29.863 --> 28:30.697
COLBY: That's as high
as they'll go.

28:30.731 --> 28:31.497
$1.3.

28:31.532 --> 28:32.498
That isn't true, Mr. Colby,

28:32.533 --> 28:33.634
and we both know it.

28:34.868 --> 28:36.937
If that document becomes public,

28:36.970 --> 28:39.139
it could generate a plethora
of new lawsuits.

28:39.172 --> 28:41.441
I typically loathe
the word, "plethora,"

28:41.474 --> 28:42.509
but when it can be used
aggressively--

28:42.543 --> 28:44.410
Look--
I'm speaking now, sir.

28:47.013 --> 28:49.816
A plaintiff victory
would be devastating for you.

28:49.850 --> 28:51.918
And a settlement,
sealed or otherwise,

28:51.952 --> 28:53.253
would be perceived
as a victory.

28:53.286 --> 28:54.454
That's your worst nightmare.

28:54.487 --> 28:55.922
What you're desperate for here

28:55.956 --> 28:57.423
is a favorable verdict.

28:57.457 --> 28:59.626
That sends the most
chilling message of all

28:59.660 --> 29:01.367
to future plaintiffs,
does it not?

29:05.739 --> 29:07.207
I will sell you
this document

29:07.240 --> 29:08.374
for $8 million.

29:14.748 --> 29:16.082
I beg your pardon?

29:16.116 --> 29:17.651
It becomes yours again.

29:17.684 --> 29:18.885
I won't introduce it,

29:18.919 --> 29:21.221
no doubt you'll get
your verdict,

29:21.254 --> 29:22.823
and even more importantly,

29:22.856 --> 29:24.490
nobody gets foul wind

29:24.525 --> 29:27.127
of a very damaging
admission.

29:29.596 --> 29:31.464
Am I to understand
you're offering

29:31.497 --> 29:33.734
to lose this case
for $8 million?

29:33.767 --> 29:35.301
You're going to accept
my offer, Mr. Colby,

29:35.335 --> 29:36.803
not because you're dishonest

29:36.837 --> 29:39.172
or ethically challenged like me,

29:39.205 --> 29:40.774
but because you're human.

29:41.608 --> 29:43.644
Because you know
this document,

29:43.677 --> 29:45.011
should it become public,

29:45.045 --> 29:47.213
would easily cost
best pharmaceuticals

29:47.247 --> 29:48.682
in the tens of millions,

29:48.715 --> 29:49.983
because you know

29:50.016 --> 29:51.384
once your client,

29:51.417 --> 29:53.887
your biggest client

29:53.920 --> 29:56.222
learns you inadvertently
disclosed this to me,

29:56.256 --> 29:57.724
they will leave you.

29:57.758 --> 29:59.392
The career flashing
before your eyes

29:59.425 --> 30:01.034
is your own, Mr. Colby.

30:01.067 --> 30:03.069
$8 million dollars.

30:03.103 --> 30:04.437
I'll rest my case now.

30:04.470 --> 30:05.906
We all go home winners.

30:06.573 --> 30:08.509
And because you are
an ethical man,

30:08.542 --> 30:10.744
you'll convince your client

30:10.777 --> 30:13.446
to hereafter warn doctors

30:13.479 --> 30:15.248
and consumers

30:15.281 --> 30:18.018
that studies show
violent ideations

30:18.051 --> 30:20.186
as a rare
but possible side effect.

30:21.387 --> 30:23.256
How about that, Mr. Colby?

30:23.289 --> 30:24.525
You get to keep your client

30:24.558 --> 30:26.359
and possibly
save a life or two,

30:26.392 --> 30:27.594
all for the one-time offer

30:27.628 --> 30:28.929
of $8 million dollars.

30:33.199 --> 30:35.536
I'd want the check today.

30:37.871 --> 30:38.839
WHITE: Where is he?

30:38.872 --> 30:41.007
WILSON: He'll be here
any second, Your Honor.

30:41.041 --> 30:42.609
He's currently in trial
on another matter.

30:43.209 --> 30:44.945
WHITE: Ms. Wilson,
I said 3:00.

30:53.086 --> 30:54.588
Step up here, Mr. Shore.

31:02.969 --> 31:04.204
I'm going to ask you now

31:04.237 --> 31:06.239
as an officer of the court,
and you will answer me

31:06.272 --> 31:08.542
subject to the pains
and penalties of perjury.

31:11.044 --> 31:12.946
Do you have possession
of the knife?

31:12.979 --> 31:14.280
I do not.

31:14.948 --> 31:16.282
Do you know where it is?

31:16.316 --> 31:17.818
I do not.

31:18.952 --> 31:20.787
Is it possibly
in your office?

31:22.756 --> 31:23.590
Possibly.

31:25.058 --> 31:26.426
Did you look for it?

31:27.861 --> 31:29.162
I did not.

31:35.636 --> 31:36.302
Sit.

31:42.408 --> 31:44.477
If a lawyer knows he's been
handed a murder weapon,

31:44.511 --> 31:46.379
he's got to give it
to the police.

31:46.412 --> 31:48.148
That's the law.

31:48.181 --> 31:49.916
But he doesn't have to go
looking for it.

31:51.451 --> 31:54.120
I cannot order Mr. Shore

31:54.154 --> 31:57.023
to provide privileged
information

31:57.057 --> 31:58.892
leading to the knife's
discovery.

31:59.926 --> 32:01.301
Without the weapon,

32:01.334 --> 32:03.336
the Commonwealth
has offered nothing.

32:03.369 --> 32:06.139
The defendant was seen
running in the area.

32:06.172 --> 32:07.340
Period.

32:09.042 --> 32:10.276
The murder charges
are dismissed

32:10.310 --> 32:11.377
without prejudice.

32:12.045 --> 32:13.313
The reckless endangerment,

32:13.346 --> 32:15.649
as well as evading the police,
those charges stand.

32:15.682 --> 32:17.818
I'll grant Mr. Grayson
bail on that.

32:18.619 --> 32:21.822
I do, however, hereby issue
a bench warrant

32:21.855 --> 32:24.791
to search Mr. Shore's
law office immediately.

32:26.359 --> 32:27.628
If you find the knife,

32:27.661 --> 32:30.096
we can start
this whole process again.

32:31.131 --> 32:32.132
Until then,

32:32.165 --> 32:34.134
case dismissed.

32:34.167 --> 32:35.035
We're adjourned.

32:35.068 --> 32:36.036
(gavel bangs)

32:36.069 --> 32:38.739
Okay, then, Ted,
we made a deal.

32:38.772 --> 32:40.373
You'd get help.
They're gonna find the knife.

32:42.008 --> 32:43.977
I wedged it under
that conference table.

32:44.010 --> 32:44.711
They'll find it.

32:44.745 --> 32:45.712
You hid the knife

32:45.746 --> 32:46.479
under the conference table?

32:46.513 --> 32:47.413
Yeah.

32:47.648 --> 32:48.314
FRUTT: Alan.

32:49.916 --> 32:51.251
The judge has just
called us back in.

32:51.284 --> 32:52.452
Have we heard from Colby?

32:52.485 --> 32:53.920
SHORE: Give me a second.

32:55.221 --> 32:56.089
They'll find it.

32:56.122 --> 32:57.658
All we can do is hope
they don't, Ted.

32:57.691 --> 32:58.725
In the meantime,

32:58.759 --> 32:59.726
Tara's gonna take you
to a hospital.

32:59.760 --> 33:00.934
I've arranged for you
to be admitted.

33:00.967 --> 33:02.569
The police will come
and get me.

33:02.603 --> 33:04.905
If we get you committed,
perhaps they won't.

33:04.938 --> 33:06.807
Tara, there's a car
in front with security.

33:06.840 --> 33:07.874
Let's get you processed
out of here.

33:08.609 --> 33:09.710
I'll visit you tomorrow.

33:09.743 --> 33:10.677
Let's go.

33:17.684 --> 33:19.119
MORENO: Glad you could
make it, counsel.

33:19.152 --> 33:20.186
I took the liberty

33:20.220 --> 33:21.855
of bringing
the jury in without you.

33:24.024 --> 33:25.258
You may proceed.

33:26.793 --> 33:28.128
I'm not doing this.

33:28.161 --> 33:29.596
You're on your own.

33:33.700 --> 33:35.201
The plaintiff rests,
Your Honor.

33:36.302 --> 33:38.271
What do you mean, you rest?

33:39.940 --> 33:40.741
We presented
our case in full.

33:40.774 --> 33:41.441
We rest.

33:45.646 --> 33:46.379
(door slams)

33:46.412 --> 33:48.081
What's going on?

33:48.114 --> 33:50.316
Your Honor,
I feel conflicted

33:50.350 --> 33:51.785
about introducing
that document.

33:52.986 --> 33:55.221
Clearly, the disclosure
was inadvertent,

33:55.255 --> 33:56.623
as well as privileged.

33:56.657 --> 33:58.592
If the shoe were
on the other foot,

33:58.625 --> 34:00.333
if this were ever done to me

34:00.366 --> 34:01.334
by another lawyer...

34:02.435 --> 34:03.904
You have evidence
that could further

34:03.937 --> 34:05.405
your client's case,
likely win it.

34:06.439 --> 34:07.841
You have an obligation

34:07.874 --> 34:09.442
to use that evidence,
Mr. Shore.

34:09.475 --> 34:11.411
I'm afraid it will make me
look unscrupulous,

34:11.444 --> 34:12.879
and the jury will punish us.

34:14.915 --> 34:16.315
What's going on here?

34:18.952 --> 34:19.753
Ms. Frutt?

34:19.786 --> 34:22.422
I disagree with Mr. Shore.

34:22.455 --> 34:25.425
But it's his client and...

34:25.458 --> 34:26.627
ultimately his call.

34:29.795 --> 34:31.397
Without that document,
this doesn't even get

34:31.431 --> 34:32.966
to a jury, counsel.

34:32.998 --> 34:34.835
I will direct a verdict
for the defendant.

34:34.868 --> 34:36.637
Well, I certainly hope
you don't do that.

34:36.670 --> 34:38.138
Oh, I will do that.

34:40.040 --> 34:41.542
You haven't even made
a prima facie showing.

34:41.574 --> 34:43.610
You've introduced
no scientific evidence.

34:44.610 --> 34:45.579
How in God's name

34:45.612 --> 34:47.813
could you even think of resting?

34:47.848 --> 34:48.748
SHORE: Your Honor,
we hope for a settlement.

34:48.782 --> 34:50.216
They didn't blink.

34:50.917 --> 34:54.655
I tipped my hat,
but using this document,

34:54.688 --> 34:55.556
(groans)

34:55.589 --> 34:56.757
I--ugh,

34:56.790 --> 34:58.391
as an officer
of the court,

35:00.026 --> 35:02.202
I can't bring myself
to take advantage of it.

35:02.636 --> 35:04.470
If you don't introduce it,

35:05.606 --> 35:08.909
I will direct
a verdict against you,

35:08.942 --> 35:10.877
and I will recommend
that your client pursue

35:10.911 --> 35:12.913
a claim for malpractice.

35:12.946 --> 35:14.314
(sighs)

35:18.184 --> 35:20.220
The plaintiff rests,
Your Honor.

35:32.165 --> 35:33.834
I don't believe this.

35:33.867 --> 35:34.968
Slip that
into your purse, Karen.

35:35.001 --> 35:36.369
This whole thing is sealed.

35:36.402 --> 35:37.571
We don't want anybody
to find out,

35:37.604 --> 35:38.872
especially the judge.

35:38.905 --> 35:40.073
The case is over?

35:40.106 --> 35:41.274
They wouldn't be paying us

35:41.307 --> 35:42.543
$8 million to continue.

35:42.576 --> 35:46.046
(exhales sharply)

35:46.079 --> 35:47.080
I don't know how to thank you.

35:48.148 --> 35:49.916
Just go take care
of your kids.

35:50.817 --> 35:51.652
Alan,

35:52.686 --> 35:56.189
can I hug you?

35:56.222 --> 35:57.758
No, I don't hug clients.

35:57.791 --> 35:59.560
I grope them on occasion,
but I never hug--

35:59.593 --> 36:02.536
(music playing)

36:14.014 --> 36:15.582
This is that man, Eugene.

36:15.616 --> 36:17.117
Ever since he's been here--

36:17.150 --> 36:18.118
look at this.

36:18.151 --> 36:18.919
Jimmy, could you perhaps

36:18.952 --> 36:20.020
lay off the guy?

36:20.053 --> 36:21.855
BERLUTI: No, I'm sick of this.

36:25.559 --> 36:26.693
A party.

36:26.727 --> 36:27.794
Where is the punch?

36:27.828 --> 36:28.662
Alan?

36:29.596 --> 36:31.998
Can you come
into my office, please?

36:32.032 --> 36:33.399
Let's all go.

36:38.872 --> 36:40.273
What, are they gonna
beat me up?

36:40.306 --> 36:41.942
(sighs) Come on.

36:53.654 --> 36:55.088
For the last two hours,

36:55.121 --> 36:57.457
our office has been
turned upside down

36:57.490 --> 36:59.693
while the police look
for a murder weapon.

37:01.167 --> 37:02.869
Myself, Jamie, and Jimmy,

37:02.902 --> 37:06.005
well, we've been unable
to do our work

37:06.039 --> 37:08.474
because once again,

37:08.508 --> 37:09.609
you have caused this place

37:09.643 --> 37:10.544
to be disrupted.

37:14.247 --> 37:15.414
Last week,
I was at the point

37:15.448 --> 37:18.084
of firing you.

37:18.117 --> 37:19.052
So, tell me, Alan.

37:19.786 --> 37:21.221
If you were
in my position,

37:21.254 --> 37:24.891
running this firm,

37:24.925 --> 37:26.760
how would you deal
with an employee

37:26.793 --> 37:27.794
like yourself?

37:32.465 --> 37:33.867
That's a tough one.

37:35.736 --> 37:38.071
On the one hand,
if someone's a liability,

37:38.104 --> 37:39.339
I say get rid of them.

37:41.107 --> 37:43.176
On the other hand, I--

37:45.579 --> 37:48.248
oh,

37:48.281 --> 37:50.183
and here's a check made out

37:50.216 --> 37:51.852
to the firm for two million,

37:51.885 --> 37:54.054
a contingency

37:54.087 --> 37:55.321
on the case we just settled.

38:00.967 --> 38:02.402
(knock on door)

38:04.538 --> 38:05.872
We're done.

38:05.906 --> 38:07.407
We'll be out of your hair
in five minutes.

38:07.440 --> 38:09.175
Did you find anything?

38:10.010 --> 38:10.844
No.

38:14.247 --> 38:15.749
(door closes)

38:21.054 --> 38:23.657
But I don't get
to leave when I want.

38:23.690 --> 38:24.991
No.

38:25.025 --> 38:26.026
If you're committed,

38:26.059 --> 38:27.093
you can't leave
until they say

38:27.127 --> 38:28.228
you're better.

38:30.964 --> 38:32.498
What if I never
get better?

38:35.101 --> 38:37.203
Could you excuse us
for a second?

38:37.237 --> 38:38.104
I'll be at the door.

38:38.138 --> 38:39.105
WILSON: Thank you.

38:45.145 --> 38:47.213
Okay,

38:47.247 --> 38:48.849
two things.

38:48.882 --> 38:51.885
First, we'll make a list
of all the doctors

38:51.918 --> 38:53.654
that you can speak to
about the evil knife,

38:53.687 --> 38:55.556
and so forth.

38:55.589 --> 38:57.824
Outside of privilege,
you can't talk to anyone

38:57.858 --> 39:00.166
about these things.

39:00.200 --> 39:01.234
Only the doctors.

39:02.335 --> 39:03.904
You already explained that.

39:03.937 --> 39:05.639
Second,

39:08.041 --> 39:09.475
you will get better, Ted.

39:12.445 --> 39:14.447
You will.

39:14.480 --> 39:17.417
(music playing)

39:19.019 --> 39:21.722
SHORE: He's been mentally ill
his entire life, Ellenor.

39:21.755 --> 39:23.323
He's in his 30s,
for God's sakes.

39:23.356 --> 39:24.357
This is the first time
he's seen

39:24.390 --> 39:25.792
the inside of a hospital.

39:25.826 --> 39:28.228
FRUTT: Well, he won't be
seeing it for long, Alan,

39:28.261 --> 39:29.763
if the police find that knife.

39:34.635 --> 39:37.403
(sighs)

39:37.437 --> 39:39.172
Can we talk about
the other case now?

39:39.205 --> 39:40.140
No.

39:44.277 --> 39:47.447
Alan, I know you.

39:47.480 --> 39:49.215
Are you trying

39:49.249 --> 39:51.885
to get disbarred?

39:51.918 --> 39:53.153
As self-destructive as--

39:53.186 --> 39:54.821
All right, all right,
on that note.

39:54.855 --> 39:56.523
Alan...

40:01.635 --> 40:02.503
BERLUTI: Hey.

40:03.870 --> 40:05.071
SHORE: Jimmy, hello.

40:05.105 --> 40:06.372
Can I buy you a beer?

40:08.141 --> 40:09.109
You're right.

40:09.142 --> 40:10.544
Baby steps.

40:10.577 --> 40:11.311
My mistake.

40:13.980 --> 40:14.948
Half a beer.

40:20.120 --> 40:21.688
Good night, my friend.

40:24.257 --> 40:25.491
Good night.

40:27.427 --> 40:30.363
(music playing)

40:34.768 --> 40:36.937
I don't get it, Ellenor.

40:36.970 --> 40:39.606
I see nothing redeeming
about that man.

40:39.640 --> 40:41.041
(exhales sharply)

40:45.579 --> 40:46.713
You have to know him, Jimmy.

40:49.716 --> 40:50.951
You just--

40:53.554 --> 40:55.822
you have to know him.

40:55.856 --> 40:58.792
(music playing)

41:37.470 --> 41:40.406
(music playing)

42:03.236 --> 42:04.805
WOMAN: You stinker!

42:05.005 --> 42:07.674
(music playing)
