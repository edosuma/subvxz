00:06.397 --> 00:07.833
<i>sexually based offenses</i>

00:07.833 --> 00:10.184

especially heinous.</i>

00:10.184 --> 00:12.534
<i>In New York City,
the dedicated detectives</i>

00:12.534 --> 00:14.318
<i>who investigate
these vicious felonies</i>

00:14.318 --> 00:15.754
<i>are members of an elite squad</i>

00:15.754 --> 00:18.105
<i>known as
the Special Victims Unit.</i>

00:18.105 --> 00:20.846
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:20.846 --> 00:23.153
If push comes to shove, I'm
never going to lie for you.

00:23.153 --> 00:25.677
No one's asking you to.

00:27.897 --> 00:30.160
<i>I left my phone on
when Detective Velasco</i>

00:30.160 --> 00:32.728
<i>was talking to that recruiter.</i>

00:32.728 --> 00:33.772
Why would you do that?

00:33.772 --> 00:35.209
You'll see when
you listen to it.

00:36.732 --> 00:39.039
I'm really
impressed with Bruno.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.345
<i>And I was thinking now
that Rollins is gone,</i>

00:41.345 --> 00:43.521
<i>we could use another body.</i>

00:43.521 --> 00:45.828
<i>Duarte can seem
a little unpredictable.</i>

00:45.828 --> 00:47.830
I've never seen him
waver about BX9, though.

00:47.830 --> 00:49.397
He's a good cop.

00:52.313 --> 00:54.619
I know how much you
respected Captain Duarte.

00:54.619 --> 00:56.969
And that's why
you killed him?

00:56.969 --> 01:00.060
<i>He wanted to take away
everything I built.</i>

01:00.060 --> 01:02.192
Couldn't allow that to happen.

01:04.542 --> 01:06.588
Emma, come on.
Keep up, silly.

01:06.588 --> 01:08.807
I'm trying, but
it's just... it's not that easy

01:08.807 --> 01:11.375
in this embarrassing
ski jacket you made me wear.

01:11.375 --> 01:12.333
I didn't want you
to get cold.

01:12.333 --> 01:13.812
I know how you get.

01:13.812 --> 01:15.945
At least there's nobody
here to witness this.

01:15.945 --> 01:17.990
You look like a
fruit-flavored soup dumpling,

01:17.990 --> 01:19.209
you know that?
- Stop!

01:19.209 --> 01:20.384
All right, all right.

01:20.384 --> 01:21.690
Close your eyes.
- Oh...

01:21.690 --> 01:22.821
- I got you, I got you.
- Okay.

01:22.821 --> 01:24.084
Okay. This is the place.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.085
What place?

01:25.085 --> 01:26.564
The place.

01:26.564 --> 01:28.218
- Can we go home now?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:28.218 --> 01:29.437
This is going to be
special, I promise.

01:29.437 --> 01:31.091
Okay.
All right.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.744
Look up.

01:32.744 --> 01:34.224
Can you pull my
hood down, please?

01:34.224 --> 01:36.139
Yes, yes.
Sorry about that.

01:38.489 --> 01:40.317
Well, this is our city.

01:40.317 --> 01:42.406
You know, we never would
have met without it.

01:42.406 --> 01:45.017
You'd still be in Boulder,
hooking up with that DJ.

01:45.017 --> 01:47.629
MC Havoc.

01:47.629 --> 01:49.413
And me?

01:49.413 --> 01:50.545
I would have been...

01:50.545 --> 01:53.156
Head coder at a banking app?

01:53.156 --> 01:55.202
Correct.

01:57.639 --> 01:59.249
You've taught me the
most important lesson

01:59.249 --> 02:01.295
of my life this past year.

02:01.295 --> 02:04.080
Yeah?
What's that?

02:04.080 --> 02:06.126
Sometimes things
just work out.

02:18.877 --> 02:20.662
Oh!

02:20.662 --> 02:23.230
Emma, will you?

02:23.230 --> 02:24.927
Oh, hell yeah!

02:28.235 --> 02:29.540
Oh, what if I lose it?

02:29.540 --> 02:32.152
Don't worry,
I got it insured.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.414
No deductible.

02:33.414 --> 02:35.851
Why does that sound so hot?

02:39.333 --> 02:41.552
I'd give anything to tell Mia.

02:41.552 --> 02:44.294
I wish I could
have met your sister.

02:44.294 --> 02:46.035
I don't even have
a maid of honor.

02:46.035 --> 02:48.211
Let's just enjoy the moment.

03:01.746 --> 03:05.359
Emma?

03:05.359 --> 03:07.404
Are you okay?

03:07.404 --> 03:10.320
I'm gonna get you out
of here, all right?

03:10.320 --> 03:12.017
Emma.

03:12.017 --> 03:13.671
Stay with me.
All right.

03:13.671 --> 03:15.630
Stay with me, okay?

03:20.200 --> 03:22.202
Oh, thank God.

03:28.904 --> 03:30.253
Hey!

03:30.253 --> 03:32.212
Hey, man.
Help me out here.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.039
My door's busted.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.046
Sit tight.

03:41.046 --> 03:43.527
What?
What the hell?

03:43.527 --> 03:46.617
Hey, hey.
Take her first, please.

03:46.617 --> 03:48.924
Please.
I think she's really hurt.

03:50.578 --> 03:53.624
I'll take care of her.

03:53.624 --> 03:55.670
Hey.

03:55.670 --> 03:57.193
Hey, dude.
What are you doing?

03:57.193 --> 03:58.760
Can't you see she's hurt?

04:33.882 --> 04:36.276
No!
Hey!

04:39.191 --> 04:41.846
No!

05:42.690 --> 05:44.692
That thing steal
your girlfriend?

05:44.692 --> 05:45.823
No, I don't
have a girlfriend.

05:45.823 --> 05:47.912
This machine just ate
another 2 bucks.

05:47.912 --> 05:49.784
What'd you want?

05:49.784 --> 05:51.002
Cashews.

05:51.002 --> 05:53.004
I got you, boo.

05:56.051 --> 05:57.966
You know, you shouldn't
let Benson see you do that.

05:57.966 --> 06:01.883
Who do you think
taught me how to do it?

06:01.883 --> 06:03.319
Yo, cowgirl.

06:03.319 --> 06:05.495
You okay?

06:06.322 --> 06:07.584
Yeah, why?

06:07.584 --> 06:09.630
No, it's just...
you know, it was, uh,

06:09.630 --> 06:11.762
Duarte's funeral yesterday,

06:11.762 --> 06:14.243
and I didn't see you
shed a tear.

06:15.940 --> 06:18.726
Do you want to
see me cry, Velasco?

06:18.726 --> 06:19.988
No.

06:19.988 --> 06:23.644
I'm just saying if
you do, it's okay.

06:23.644 --> 06:25.123
Why?

06:25.123 --> 06:28.083
So you can hold me?

06:32.043 --> 06:35.177
You know what you are?
You're a walking red flag.

06:35.177 --> 06:36.787
Well, you're a whole
bundle of red flags

06:36.787 --> 06:38.485
sewn into the shape
of a person.

06:42.053 --> 06:44.578
Bruno wants to
ride with us today?

06:44.578 --> 06:45.883
You don't remember?

06:45.883 --> 06:48.103
We kind of had a whole
conversation about this.

06:48.103 --> 06:50.888
The night that Duarte
was murdered, Fin?

06:50.888 --> 06:53.282
Really?
You expect me to remember that?

06:53.282 --> 06:55.502
We need more bodies.
The guy's done with the Bronx.

06:55.502 --> 06:57.547
He wants to see if
Manhattan's a good fit.

06:57.547 --> 06:58.853
Okay.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.550
So you want to
keep a stray puppy.

07:00.550 --> 07:02.291
You got to keep one.

07:04.336 --> 07:05.555
Fine.

07:05.555 --> 07:07.209
But you call McGrath.

07:07.209 --> 07:09.690
You know, and by ride
with us, you mean

07:09.690 --> 07:11.909
that he wants to audition us.

07:13.694 --> 07:15.260
Exactly.

07:17.219 --> 07:19.395
Look who finally made it
south of the Harlem River.

07:19.395 --> 07:21.528
Let's hope he doesn't
break out in a rash.

07:21.528 --> 07:23.747
Hey, I heard this
was a functional SVU.

07:23.747 --> 07:24.966
That depends.

07:24.966 --> 07:26.402
Are we talking
people or procedures?

07:26.402 --> 07:27.664
Very funny.

07:27.664 --> 07:29.187
I talked to Benson.

07:29.187 --> 07:31.712
Is she good with this?
I mean, just as a trial period?

07:31.712 --> 07:32.974
Yeah.

07:32.974 --> 07:34.062
All right.

07:34.062 --> 07:36.281
Well, where do I sit for now?

07:37.848 --> 07:40.198
Uh, I would not sit there.

07:41.548 --> 07:42.940
Detective Bruno.

07:42.940 --> 07:45.769
I see you've made
yourself comfortable.

07:45.769 --> 07:47.379
I'm just, uh,
you know, getting

07:47.379 --> 07:49.425
a feel for how you roll.
- Yeah.

07:49.425 --> 07:51.949
Well, if you wanna
sit there, uh,

07:51.949 --> 07:55.039
you're going to
have to earn it.

07:55.039 --> 07:56.432
That was Mercy.

07:56.432 --> 07:58.434
Car accident vic
just disclosed a rape.

07:58.434 --> 08:01.568
Okay.
Bruno, you're with me.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.358
<i>So from what I gather,</i>

08:09.358 --> 08:11.012
that was
your friend Rollins' old desk?

08:11.012 --> 08:12.361
Oh, how did you gather that?

08:12.361 --> 08:14.537
20 minutes dead silence,
rush hour traffic...

08:14.537 --> 08:15.669
pretty good tip-off.

08:15.669 --> 08:17.061
You're quite a
detective, aren't you?

08:17.061 --> 08:18.889
- Captain Benson.
- Doctor.

08:18.889 --> 08:20.238
Who's this?

08:20.238 --> 08:22.110
Her candy striper.

08:22.110 --> 08:24.634
What can you tell us
about the victim?

08:24.634 --> 08:25.853
Uh, Emma Dunn, 25.

08:25.853 --> 08:27.550
In a car accident
with her fiancé.

08:27.550 --> 08:30.466
- She reported an assault?
- Her fiancé did.

08:30.466 --> 08:32.555
She doesn't remember it,
but he claims he saw her

08:32.555 --> 08:34.209
getting raped by the EMT.

08:34.209 --> 08:36.428
- The EMT?
- Yeah.

08:36.428 --> 08:37.952
Okay.

08:37.952 --> 08:40.432
Can we question this EMT?

08:40.432 --> 08:42.086
You could
if I knew who he was.

08:42.086 --> 08:43.479
How did she get here?

08:43.479 --> 08:45.829
They were both brought in
by a patrol officer.

08:45.829 --> 08:47.788
Excuse me.

08:47.788 --> 08:49.050
Wow.

08:49.050 --> 08:51.095
All right.
Uh, divide and conquer,

08:51.095 --> 08:52.662
or do you need me
to hold your hand?

08:52.662 --> 08:53.707
I think I got it.

08:56.927 --> 08:58.363
Is Josh gonna be
all right?

08:58.363 --> 09:01.453
He has a concussion
and a broken leg,

09:01.453 --> 09:03.760
but the doctor says
he's going to heal.

09:04.674 --> 09:07.111
He kept crying.

09:07.111 --> 09:10.593
He said, "I'm sorry
I didn't save you."

09:10.593 --> 09:14.336
He never cries.
- This is not his fault, Emma.

09:14.336 --> 09:17.121
And it's not yours, either.

09:18.906 --> 09:20.777
Can you tell me what happened?

09:20.777 --> 09:23.475
Josh told me I was raped.

09:23.475 --> 09:25.695
But you don't remember it?

09:27.001 --> 09:29.394
The crash messed me up.

09:30.091 --> 09:35.183
So how about, um, we start
with what you do remember?

09:35.183 --> 09:39.317
Josh and I were by
the Brooklyn Bridge.

09:39.317 --> 09:41.363
He asked me to marry him.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.671
Congratulations.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.326
Where's my ring?

09:49.632 --> 09:53.331
Um, well...

09:53.331 --> 09:54.637
let me ask the doctor.

09:54.637 --> 09:57.858
Maybe they removed it
on intake. Okay.

09:57.858 --> 10:01.775
This was supposed to be
the happiest night of my life.

10:02.732 --> 10:04.995
One of many.

10:04.995 --> 10:06.910
It sounds like
you and your fiancé

10:06.910 --> 10:09.130
love each other very much.

10:10.305 --> 10:12.742
You'll get through this.

10:12.742 --> 10:15.266
And you already survived.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.400
<i>Okay.</i>

10:18.400 --> 10:21.446
Why don't you tell me
about this EMT?

10:21.446 --> 10:23.492
I-I don't know anything.

10:23.492 --> 10:25.755
- Who called the ambulance?
- No one.

10:25.755 --> 10:27.061
He just showed up?

10:27.061 --> 10:29.716
He must have seen the crash.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.065
Anybody else with him?

10:31.065 --> 10:33.023
No, he was the only one.

10:33.023 --> 10:34.416
I thought they worked in teams.

10:34.416 --> 10:37.158
Usually, they do.

10:37.158 --> 10:39.160
Anything else you can remember?

10:39.160 --> 10:42.119
Him pulling Emma
into the ambulance.

10:42.119 --> 10:46.689
So I got out of the car,
and I crawled over.

10:48.430 --> 10:51.259
He had cut her clothes off.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.741
It's okay.

10:54.741 --> 10:57.134
Take your time.

10:58.788 --> 11:03.271
He had her legs up...
over his shoulder.

11:03.271 --> 11:06.796
I couldn't stop it.

11:06.796 --> 11:10.321
I-I couldn't do anything.

11:10.321 --> 11:12.846
Can you tell me
what he looked like?

11:12.846 --> 11:15.109
Was he white, Black?

11:15.109 --> 11:18.112
His build, anything?

11:18.112 --> 11:20.244
How about his face?

11:22.420 --> 11:25.467
While he was raping Emma,

11:25.467 --> 11:29.689
he turned around
and looked right at me.

11:30.907 --> 11:33.997
Seemed like he liked it...

11:33.997 --> 11:36.304
that I was helpless.

11:39.437 --> 11:42.310
What's wrong with people?

11:43.790 --> 11:47.837
I'm convinced
the world peaked in 1999.

11:47.837 --> 11:50.144
That whole Y2K thing...

11:50.144 --> 11:52.015
the world ended, all right.

11:52.015 --> 11:54.757
It's just taking
the scenic route.

11:55.889 --> 11:58.630
No one at the hospital
could ID this EMT,

11:58.630 --> 11:59.980
and the patrol officers
who picked up Josh

11:59.980 --> 12:01.416
didn't see an ambulance.

12:01.416 --> 12:02.547
No hits on the ambulance?

12:02.547 --> 12:05.333
I got something
on the traffic cams.

12:06.160 --> 12:09.511
Late winter night, deserted
intersection, no witnesses.

12:09.511 --> 12:11.687
Couldn't ID the bus
or its driver,

12:11.687 --> 12:14.255
but I got the plate
of the other vehicle.

12:15.778 --> 12:18.128
Find out why this kid
didn't call the cops.

12:18.128 --> 12:19.739
Copy that.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.789
Our traffic cams show him
entering the intersection

12:26.789 --> 12:28.138
on a red light.

12:28.138 --> 12:30.488
- It was green.
- Can you replay the footage?

12:30.488 --> 12:33.491
It's not going to
change a thing, but sure.

12:37.321 --> 12:39.846
Look at the time code.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.369
These lights
are all calibrated.

12:41.369 --> 12:43.110
This obviously wasn't.

12:43.110 --> 12:44.676
So I have a suit
against the city.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.548
Not to mention the one
for malpractice.

12:46.548 --> 12:48.202
- Against who?
- Against whatever hospital

12:48.202 --> 12:49.594
sent that ambulance.

12:49.594 --> 12:52.467
The driver left my son
bleeding on the road

12:52.467 --> 12:53.947
in a dangerous neighborhood.

12:53.947 --> 12:55.296
Chelsea?

12:55.296 --> 12:56.384
You want me to
subpoena you, too?

12:56.384 --> 12:57.777
Okay. Just...

12:59.169 --> 13:02.346
What can you tell us
about the ambulance driver?

13:02.346 --> 13:04.000
Other than the fact
that he was incompetent?

13:04.000 --> 13:04.914
I mean...
- Okay, Robbie.

13:04.914 --> 13:06.350
That's enough.

13:06.350 --> 13:08.352
You should tell your son
to seek better counsel.

13:08.352 --> 13:09.745
Better than me?

13:09.745 --> 13:11.660
He'd be hard-pressed
to find it.

13:11.660 --> 13:12.748
Hmm.

13:12.748 --> 13:14.184
Okay.

13:14.184 --> 13:16.230
Can you explain this?

13:17.144 --> 13:18.754
Those are pictures of
your son on a bar crawl

13:18.754 --> 13:22.453
last night--
all over social media.

13:24.499 --> 13:25.892
That doesn't prove anything.

13:25.892 --> 13:28.851
Unless you're gonna
hop into a time machine,

13:28.851 --> 13:31.332
make him take a breathalyzer?
- No.

13:31.332 --> 13:33.029
But the judge is not
going to like it.

13:33.029 --> 13:35.945
Especially in light of
his three previous DUIs.

13:39.557 --> 13:41.516
What do you want?

13:41.516 --> 13:44.911
We gotta ID this EMT.

13:44.911 --> 13:47.609
Think you can do that?

13:47.609 --> 13:49.829
Is that going to
screw up the lawsuit?

13:49.829 --> 13:53.049
Just might help us find
this negligent prick.

13:53.049 --> 13:54.790
Go ahead.

13:54.790 --> 13:57.445
I took a photo of
his license plate.

14:06.541 --> 14:06.933
<i>...</i>

14:06.933 --> 14:09.457
So I traced the license plate
of the ambo and I got a hit.

14:09.457 --> 14:10.414
Yeah, but it's
not going to help.

14:10.414 --> 14:11.851
Why not?

14:11.851 --> 14:14.505
It was stolen off a Toyota
in Canarsie last year.

14:14.505 --> 14:17.247
- Toyota owner report it?
- The next day.

14:17.247 --> 14:20.033
So he likely has no idea
where the plate wound up.

14:21.948 --> 14:25.125
Zoom in on that photo
that affluenza kid took.

14:26.648 --> 14:29.433
Guy tried to hide it, but look.
Faded vehicle numbers.

14:29.433 --> 14:32.219
He peeled
the vinyl stickers off.

14:32.219 --> 14:34.699
Which means probably
he either stole it

14:34.699 --> 14:36.310
or bought it at auction.
- Okay.

14:36.310 --> 14:39.879
So call around and find out
if any bus with the same make

14:39.879 --> 14:43.447
and model has been sold at an
auction in the last few years.

14:43.447 --> 14:46.929
Well, my gobs are smacked
and my ghasts are flabbered.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.583
Are you having
a stroke or something?

14:48.583 --> 14:49.845
No.

14:49.845 --> 14:51.455
But it's been
a long time since I've

14:51.455 --> 14:53.631
been in a room full of
cops working a non-DOJ case

14:53.631 --> 14:55.851
in a timely, efficient manner.

14:55.851 --> 14:57.853
Well, welcome to Manhattan.

14:57.853 --> 15:00.073
Yeah, we get it done, son.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.425
<i>Hey.</i>

15:04.425 --> 15:06.427
We're looking for a guy
named George Kalazakis.

15:06.427 --> 15:07.732
Well, who's asking?

15:07.732 --> 15:09.299
Well, didn't
want to go there.

15:09.299 --> 15:12.737
But we have probable cause
he's involved in a rape.

15:12.737 --> 15:13.913
George?

15:13.913 --> 15:16.437
He'd never need
to rape anybody.

15:16.437 --> 15:17.742
He's happily married.

15:17.742 --> 15:19.788
Well, unfortunately,
marriage isn't always

15:19.788 --> 15:22.138
a barrier for sexual assault.

15:22.138 --> 15:23.835
In case you haven't
noticed, human beings

15:23.835 --> 15:25.489
are little more than
homicidal monkeys

15:25.489 --> 15:29.667
with zero respect for this
planet or each other.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.104
Hey, Georgie.

15:31.104 --> 15:33.019
Georgie, over here.

15:33.019 --> 15:36.326
Some folks from the NYPD
want to talk to you.

15:36.326 --> 15:39.025
Captain Benson,
and this is Detective Bruno.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.983
We just have some
questions for you.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.332
Yeah? What about?

15:42.332 --> 15:43.855
We'd like you to come
down to the precinct.

15:43.855 --> 15:45.205
What, am I under arrest?

15:45.205 --> 15:47.207
No, but you could be.

15:47.207 --> 15:50.166
So we can cuff you here,
in front of your coworkers,

15:50.166 --> 15:52.038
or you can come with us.

15:53.909 --> 15:55.563
Good choice.

16:06.182 --> 16:07.749
It could be him.

16:07.749 --> 16:09.446
But then again, maybe not.

16:09.446 --> 16:12.884
Well, I'd prefer it
if you were 100% sure.

16:12.884 --> 16:15.975
I can't remember his face.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.020
So nothing?

16:18.020 --> 16:19.979
That night's all a big blur.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.938
I-I can't even
remember my engagement.

16:27.682 --> 16:29.423
So that's why you came here.

16:32.382 --> 16:34.036
Have you talked to Josh?

16:34.036 --> 16:36.517
He hasn't returned our calls.

16:36.517 --> 16:38.345
Mine neither.

16:38.345 --> 16:40.260
Why do you think that is?

16:40.738 --> 16:43.176
He's never been through
anything like this.

16:43.176 --> 16:44.916
And you have?

16:44.916 --> 16:49.312
Not like this, but...

16:49.312 --> 16:53.055
when my twin sister Mia
died last year, I...

16:53.055 --> 16:54.926
I hit rock bottom.

16:54.926 --> 16:59.061
And you refuse
to let whoever did this

16:59.061 --> 17:01.672
hurt you more than that.

17:05.589 --> 17:09.071
Do you think Josh is going
to call off our engagement

17:09.071 --> 17:11.073
because I was raped?

17:11.073 --> 17:14.250
Only Josh can answer that.

17:14.250 --> 17:18.602
But I'll tell you this.
If he does...

17:18.602 --> 17:21.997
he wasn't the right partner
for you in the first place.

17:28.656 --> 17:30.962
- They all kind of look alike.
- All right.

17:30.962 --> 17:33.313
Just take all
the time you need.

17:36.968 --> 17:38.535
All right.

17:38.535 --> 17:40.233
All right, what?

17:40.233 --> 17:42.452
I think I know who it is.

17:42.452 --> 17:44.498
You going to tell me, or...

17:44.498 --> 17:46.891
What difference does it make?

17:46.891 --> 17:51.026
If you pick the guy, then
we can formally arrest him.

17:51.026 --> 17:53.333
Then he goes to court,
then jail time.

17:56.510 --> 17:58.468
If I would have just
delayed our engagement

17:58.468 --> 18:01.558
by five minutes, I would have
got to that intersection

18:01.558 --> 18:03.647
five minutes later.

18:03.647 --> 18:06.172
And what, none of this
would have happened?

18:06.172 --> 18:09.653
It would have
changed everything.

18:09.653 --> 18:12.482
Look, I took the fire
test and the cop test

18:12.482 --> 18:15.094
within a week of each other
when I was your age.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.965
So?

18:16.965 --> 18:18.793
So you want to
know why I'm a cop?

18:18.793 --> 18:20.534
My dirty little secret.

18:20.534 --> 18:24.103
It's because the police
department called me first.

18:25.147 --> 18:27.106
What-what's your point?

18:27.106 --> 18:30.631
I am here now.
And so are you.

18:30.631 --> 18:33.808
What, you think either
our lives would be different,

18:33.808 --> 18:37.159
huh, if we took
a right instead of a left?

18:37.159 --> 18:40.510
It's all the same amount
of crappy and good.

18:41.424 --> 18:44.123
I didn't protect her.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.647
But you can do something now.

18:46.647 --> 18:48.866
Be there for her.

18:48.866 --> 18:51.130
She needs you.

18:59.703 --> 19:01.401
That's him.

19:01.401 --> 19:03.838
That's the son of a bitch,
right there.

19:10.627 --> 19:12.586
So Bruno says the fiancé ID'd

19:12.586 --> 19:14.196
the Greek used car salesman
as the EMT.

19:14.196 --> 19:17.199
So we have the who.
Not sure on the why.

19:17.199 --> 19:19.201
He's a rapist.

19:19.201 --> 19:20.333
Rapists rape.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.073
With a used ambulance?

19:22.073 --> 19:23.814
It's kind of an elaborate
plan, don't you think?

19:23.814 --> 19:26.165
Was he just sitting around,
waiting for accidents?

19:26.165 --> 19:27.601
This is New York City
in the winter.

19:27.601 --> 19:29.733
There's car accidents
every 12 seconds.

19:29.733 --> 19:32.258
I don't know.
Maybe he had a scanner.

19:32.258 --> 19:35.217
He shows up at the crash
before the real EMTs.

19:35.217 --> 19:38.394
Maybe.

19:38.394 --> 19:40.222
What?
What are you thinking?

19:42.137 --> 19:43.747
I just think the couple
was at the wrong place

19:43.747 --> 19:45.662
at the wrong time.

19:48.404 --> 19:50.493
Like Duarte?

19:50.493 --> 19:53.061
Had he not gone to that
bodega to buy cigarettes...

19:53.061 --> 19:54.541
I mean, the guy quit
smoking six months ago.

19:54.541 --> 19:56.325
I don't know why he picked
that night to start again.

19:56.325 --> 19:58.197
You're trying to make
sense of things that don't--

19:58.197 --> 20:00.851
It doesn't matter.
The guy was a stupid prick.

20:00.851 --> 20:03.463
You're mad at him for dying.
That's good.

20:03.463 --> 20:05.334
Any emotion
is better than none.

20:07.118 --> 20:09.425
Duarte had
a target on his back.

20:09.425 --> 20:11.775
So that was his fate?

20:11.775 --> 20:13.168
He made a choice.

20:13.168 --> 20:17.128
To go smoke,
to go after Oscar Papa.

20:17.128 --> 20:21.481
Those five guys with machetes,
that was the result of that.

20:21.481 --> 20:24.440
I don't think that was fate.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.529
I think that was destiny.

20:30.968 --> 20:33.580
Yeah.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.234
<i>I didn't rape anyone.</i>

20:35.234 --> 20:36.844
The rapist matches
your description.

20:36.844 --> 20:38.802
He was driving
the surplus ambulance

20:38.802 --> 20:40.848
you purchased with
your dealer's license

20:40.848 --> 20:42.589
at an auction in Pennsylvania.

20:42.589 --> 20:45.940
We told you, that dealer's
license was stolen a year ago.

20:45.940 --> 20:48.508
And he didn't report it
to the police?

20:48.508 --> 20:49.770
I didn't want the hassle.

20:49.770 --> 20:50.988
I told you,
I just got another one.

20:50.988 --> 20:52.207
This is ridiculous.

20:52.207 --> 20:53.817
My client doesn't
own an ambulance,

20:53.817 --> 20:55.471
nor is he impersonating an EMT.

20:55.471 --> 20:58.169
Then why can't he corroborate
his whereabouts that night?

20:58.169 --> 21:00.302
Because I can't.

21:00.302 --> 21:01.869
That's your defense?

21:01.869 --> 21:03.871
You gonna use that
in front of a jury?

21:03.871 --> 21:06.134
That's about as useful as
the two pieces of celery

21:06.134 --> 21:09.268
they put on the plate
with the buffalo wings.

21:09.268 --> 21:12.575
Just tell them.

21:12.575 --> 21:13.837
Can't.

21:13.837 --> 21:16.144
It's personal.

21:16.144 --> 21:18.320
You know what's personal?

21:18.320 --> 21:20.366
Making license plates
in Green Haven,

21:20.366 --> 21:22.281
instead of slapping
them on the back of cars

21:22.281 --> 21:24.326
driving off your lot.

21:25.719 --> 21:27.329
The fiancé made
a positive ID?

21:27.329 --> 21:28.765
He's picked him
out of a six-pack.

21:28.765 --> 21:30.419
That's a good start.

21:30.419 --> 21:31.855
We're going to have to bring
him in for a proper lineup,

21:31.855 --> 21:33.814
though.
What about the victim?

21:33.814 --> 21:34.945
Uh, she doesn't
remember the assault.

21:34.945 --> 21:36.643
So we're waiting for DNA.
- Okay.

21:36.643 --> 21:37.905
Did you find the ambulance?

21:37.905 --> 21:39.167
The search of
his garage at home

21:39.167 --> 21:40.821
turned up an old box
of "Playboys"

21:40.821 --> 21:42.910
and an unused fondue set.

21:42.910 --> 21:44.172
Ah, another crime.

21:44.172 --> 21:46.174
So we're running
his financials,

21:46.174 --> 21:48.176
cell phone records, the usual.

21:48.176 --> 21:49.656
But no priors.

21:49.656 --> 21:52.354
And if he's got a real alibi,
he's not giving it up.

21:52.354 --> 21:54.965
Maybe his wife will,
when Muncy and Velasco

21:54.965 --> 21:57.794
tell her why her husband
is in an interrogation room.

21:59.883 --> 22:01.972
Some woman's
accusing George of rape?

22:01.972 --> 22:03.670
That's not possible.

22:03.670 --> 22:05.236
We understand why you would
say that, Mrs. Kalazakis,

22:05.236 --> 22:07.326
but we have
a credible allegation.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.503
No, you don't get it.
That's just not possible.

22:10.503 --> 22:12.156
Okay, well, can you tell
us where your husband

22:12.156 --> 22:13.201
was the other night?
- Yes.

22:13.201 --> 22:15.421
I had my brother following him.

22:15.421 --> 22:17.814
George was out with his fling.

22:17.814 --> 22:19.860
Your husband's
cheating on you?

22:19.860 --> 22:22.602
I have the
pictures to prove it.

22:22.602 --> 22:24.343
Time stamped and everything.

22:29.913 --> 22:31.698
Your brother's
a hell of a PI.

22:31.698 --> 22:33.743
We're Greek.
We stick together.

22:33.743 --> 22:35.571
George is a handsome man.

22:35.571 --> 22:37.312
He has a lot of opportunity.

22:37.312 --> 22:39.575
Look, I don't mind
that he does it.

22:39.575 --> 22:41.621
I just don't want
to be lied to.

22:41.621 --> 22:43.231
Neither do we.

22:43.231 --> 22:45.276
You have a name for
the woman?

22:47.017 --> 22:49.368
So still no ID on
this mysterious woman

22:49.368 --> 22:51.065
with Kalazakis the
night of Emma's rape?

22:51.065 --> 22:52.632
Uh, the wife doesn't know.

22:52.632 --> 22:55.896
And it doesn't matter, because
the DNA is not a match.

22:55.896 --> 22:57.811
Kalazakis is not our rapist.

22:57.811 --> 22:59.639
So we're looking
for somebody who

22:59.639 --> 23:01.771
stole Kalazakis's
dealer's license,

23:01.771 --> 23:03.730
and then bought
a used ambulance?

23:03.730 --> 23:04.948
What is the connection here?

23:04.948 --> 23:06.602
And why did that
kid Josh ID him?

23:06.602 --> 23:08.430
He was feeling pretty
useless at the moment.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.171
I think he just wanted
to do something.

23:10.171 --> 23:12.173
Please tell me you did
not coax an ID out of him.

23:12.173 --> 23:13.783
I am sure that
Detective Bruno

23:13.783 --> 23:15.437
wouldn't make that mistake.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.178
This ain't the Bronx.

23:17.178 --> 23:19.615
Well, either way, we gotta
cut Kalazakis loose.

23:19.615 --> 23:22.705
You weren't in the room.
The air had a certain funk.

23:22.705 --> 23:24.272
- A funk?
- Yeah, it malingered.

23:24.272 --> 23:25.926
Now that you mention it,
the air did

23:25.926 --> 23:28.407
have a certain mildew-y smell.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.756
Like when someone's
lying to you.

23:29.756 --> 23:31.497
Guys, he's a
used car salesman.

23:31.497 --> 23:33.063
If he's breathing, he's lying.

23:33.063 --> 23:35.283
It's your call, Captain.
We can take another go at him.

23:35.283 --> 23:37.198
I don't care if you
smell dirty tube socks.

23:37.198 --> 23:38.895
You don't have any evidence
tying him to the assault.

23:38.895 --> 23:40.941
I'm not doubting your nose,
Detective Bruno.

23:40.941 --> 23:42.986
But whatever lies
you picked up on,

23:42.986 --> 23:45.902
they're now between
him and his wife.

23:47.251 --> 23:48.905
<i>I'm gonna head out.</i>

23:48.905 --> 23:51.212
You want to get a beer?

23:51.212 --> 23:52.953
No.

23:52.953 --> 23:54.694
You know, working
a case with no leads

23:54.694 --> 23:55.869
is not going to help you forget
the fact that your old boss

23:55.869 --> 23:57.305
was murdered.

23:57.305 --> 23:58.915
It's kind of hard
to forget, Velasco,

23:58.915 --> 24:00.308
because you keep reminding me
every five goddamn seconds.

24:00.308 --> 24:01.788
Whoa. Are you gonna hulk
out on me now?

24:01.788 --> 24:04.791
- Yeah, if you keep pushing me.
- All right, look.

24:04.791 --> 24:06.357
It's none of my business.

24:06.357 --> 24:07.968
But maybe you cover
everything with anger

24:07.968 --> 24:09.665
because you don't
want to deal with how

24:09.665 --> 24:12.451
deep the sadness goes.

24:14.540 --> 24:15.671
One beer.

24:17.847 --> 24:19.806
No, no.
Let it go.

24:19.806 --> 24:21.372
We're off shift.
Come on.

24:22.939 --> 24:26.203
SVU.

24:28.684 --> 24:30.947
What corner?

24:30.947 --> 24:32.688
How did this happen?

24:32.688 --> 24:34.516
Some type of signal failure.

24:34.516 --> 24:36.126
What do you mean?

24:36.126 --> 24:37.519
Well, the light turned
green while the other vehicle

24:37.519 --> 24:39.129
was in the intersection.

24:39.129 --> 24:41.088
The woman swerved to avoid it,
and hit the guy on the bike.

24:41.088 --> 24:42.524
I'm starting to think
someone's deliberately

24:42.524 --> 24:43.873
causing these crashes.

24:43.873 --> 24:46.528
- How is that even possible?
- Captain!

24:46.528 --> 24:47.616
Captain, over here.

24:49.879 --> 24:51.490
My God.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.796
Car accident vic.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.755
Hi.

24:55.755 --> 24:58.366
Can you tell me what happened?

24:58.366 --> 25:02.283
The ambulance driver
was right there.

25:02.283 --> 25:05.068
I thought he was
going to help me.

25:05.068 --> 25:07.201
But he raped me.

25:19.126 --> 25:21.432
Look at Emma Dunn
compared to Danielle Thomas.

25:21.432 --> 25:23.173
- Oh, they look alike.
- Yeah.

25:23.173 --> 25:24.523
You think we're looking
at a pattern rapist?

25:24.523 --> 25:26.002
Uh, I thought so at first.

25:26.002 --> 25:28.483
Any other intersection
between the two vics?

25:28.483 --> 25:30.137
No.
One's engaged, one's divorced.

25:30.137 --> 25:31.660
Work in two different fields,
live in two

25:31.660 --> 25:33.227
different parts of the city.
- Okay.

25:33.227 --> 25:34.489
Well, what about friends?

25:34.489 --> 25:35.359
Could they have gone
to the same school?

25:35.359 --> 25:37.361
No.

25:37.361 --> 25:41.017
Maybe this guy
staged car accidents,

25:41.017 --> 25:44.978
targeting similar-looking,
dark-haired, dark-eyed women?

25:44.978 --> 25:48.111
Or, sad to say, maybe
it's just completely random.

25:48.111 --> 25:50.070
Like most things in life.

25:50.070 --> 25:53.073
Well, that's
a depressing thought.

25:56.119 --> 25:58.513
I was rushing home
to pick up my kids.

25:58.513 --> 26:00.297
My ex and I share custody.

26:00.297 --> 26:01.995
He hates when I'm late.

26:01.995 --> 26:04.606
But the light had
just turned green...

26:04.606 --> 26:07.740
The accident
was not your fault.

26:07.740 --> 26:12.048
That kid on the bicycle
I hit, he going to make it?

26:12.048 --> 26:13.789
Yeah, he will.

26:13.789 --> 26:16.749
Let's worry about you
right now, Danielle, okay?

26:16.749 --> 26:18.968
Tell us about the EMT.

26:19.882 --> 26:23.320
He appeared out of
nowhere, right at my window.

26:23.320 --> 26:28.717
He dragged me out of my car,
into his ambulance.

26:28.717 --> 26:33.287
So you told us that
he assaulted you.

26:33.287 --> 26:35.594
Do you remember any details?

26:35.594 --> 26:38.727
He cut off my pants.

26:38.727 --> 26:45.647
Next thing I know,
he's inside me, my legs up.

26:45.647 --> 26:48.258
It was so surreal.

26:48.258 --> 26:49.738
Can you describe him?

26:49.738 --> 26:53.916
His race, his build,
anything at all?

26:53.916 --> 26:57.093
Uh, white.

26:57.093 --> 27:00.009
Tall.

27:00.009 --> 27:02.664
He kept telling me
to calm down.

27:02.664 --> 27:04.927
Yeah, like that works.

27:04.927 --> 27:07.277
I kind of went
into fight or flight.

27:07.277 --> 27:10.629
Kicked him off, got away.

27:10.629 --> 27:13.240
As far as I know,
he didn't finish.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.285
Well, that's still a rape.

27:15.285 --> 27:20.290
Look, we'd like to do a
rape kit and check for DNA.

27:20.290 --> 27:22.031
Yeah.

27:22.031 --> 27:24.773
What kind of sicko
rapes a woman

27:24.773 --> 27:27.123
at the scene of an accident?

27:27.123 --> 27:31.475
He targets the vulnerable,
like every other predator

27:31.475 --> 27:34.522
on this planet.

27:35.392 --> 27:37.917
I'm so sorry.

27:37.917 --> 27:41.660
I know drivers in
this city hate cyclists.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.444
What, you think she
ran into you on purpose?

27:43.444 --> 27:44.837
I had the light.

27:44.837 --> 27:47.709
She just plowed into
the intersection and hit me.

27:47.709 --> 27:49.363
How long was the light green?

27:49.363 --> 27:51.191
Seemed like forever.

27:51.191 --> 27:53.715
That's because it was.

27:53.715 --> 27:55.978
You remember an
ambulance in the vicinity?

27:55.978 --> 27:57.110
Vicinity?

27:57.110 --> 27:58.720
In the area.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.243
There was one
parked up the block.

28:00.243 --> 28:01.984
I remember because he was
blocking the bike lane,

28:01.984 --> 28:03.638
and that always pisses me off.

28:03.638 --> 28:05.509
You know there's
a fix for that, right?

28:05.509 --> 28:07.555
- What?
- A MetroCard.

28:09.644 --> 28:10.776
Thanks, man.

28:12.429 --> 28:14.605
Thanks.
We're on our way.

28:14.605 --> 28:16.172
Okay.

28:16.172 --> 28:18.827
Velasco pulled traffic cams
from the intersection.

28:18.827 --> 28:21.917
Speaking of which,
you two are close, right?

28:21.917 --> 28:23.092
Yeah.

28:23.092 --> 28:24.615
How well do you
think you know him?

28:24.615 --> 28:26.095
From what I can
piece together

28:26.095 --> 28:27.488
between his grunts
and his one-word answers,

28:27.488 --> 28:28.750
I'd say pretty well.

28:28.750 --> 28:30.709
Sometimes...
sometimes we think

28:30.709 --> 28:32.232
we know someone, but we don't.

28:32.232 --> 28:34.713
You know Officer Churlish,
up in the Bronx?

28:34.713 --> 28:37.498
- Yeah, the White Shield?
- Yeah.

28:37.498 --> 28:40.327
So she gave me something that
I would like you to listen to.

28:40.327 --> 28:42.764
And you were honest
with me about Duarte,

28:42.764 --> 28:45.854
and I trust that if
you hear anything

28:45.854 --> 28:47.900
that's worth mentioning,
that you'll

28:47.900 --> 28:49.553
bring it to my attention.

28:49.553 --> 28:51.904
Yes.
Of course, Captain.

28:52.948 --> 28:54.123
Great.

29:01.261 --> 29:02.915
So the lights on both
sides of the intersection

29:02.915 --> 29:04.438
were green at the same time.

29:04.438 --> 29:06.919
And then boom, he launches
a kid off his bike.

29:06.919 --> 29:08.007
So what are we
looking at, some sort

29:08.007 --> 29:10.052
of traffic light malfunction?

29:10.052 --> 29:12.533
At both accidents
where a woman was raped?

29:12.533 --> 29:14.578
This guy's somehow causing it.

29:14.578 --> 29:16.319
Well, I don't
see an ambulance

29:16.319 --> 29:17.843
anywhere around the scene.

29:17.843 --> 29:19.801
Because the device works
from 1,500 feet away.

29:19.801 --> 29:21.368
An InfraPass?

29:21.368 --> 29:23.413
The device that emergency
vehicles use to turn

29:23.413 --> 29:24.588
the red lights to green?

29:24.588 --> 29:26.982
They don't cause accidents.

29:26.982 --> 29:30.551
Yeah. This guy must have
tampered with the electronics.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.727
I do have someone we could ask.

29:32.727 --> 29:34.294
Oh.

29:34.294 --> 29:35.686
I guess you were right.

29:35.686 --> 29:37.732
About what?

29:37.732 --> 29:40.866
Maybe we could
use you around here.

29:43.346 --> 29:44.826
Hi.

29:46.567 --> 29:48.264
Captain Benson, my ex, Rose.

29:48.264 --> 29:50.571
- Thank you for meeting us.
- Of course.

29:50.571 --> 29:53.052
You're looking for a hacked
version of an InfraPass.

29:53.052 --> 29:56.272
Like a remote control
for traffic lights.

29:56.272 --> 29:59.667
Wow. I take it this is
the play button?

30:03.671 --> 30:05.064
Wow.

30:05.064 --> 30:08.284
Uh, that will cut
down on your commutes.

30:08.284 --> 30:09.895
Used normally.

30:09.895 --> 30:11.331
But your perp must have
messed with the transmitters

30:11.331 --> 30:13.072
to keep both lights
green at the same time.

30:13.072 --> 30:14.813
Deliberately
causing an accident.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.379
I mean, how do you even
get your hands on one

30:16.379 --> 30:17.467
of these in the first place?

30:17.467 --> 30:19.121
If you're
mechanically inclined,

30:19.121 --> 30:20.819
you can build a custom one
from simple parts found

30:20.819 --> 30:22.559
at any electronics store.

30:22.559 --> 30:25.736
Be a hell of a lot easier to
buy one on eBay and tweak it.

30:25.736 --> 30:28.130
So no help tracking our guy.

30:28.130 --> 30:29.523
Fire department
keeps a close eye on them.

30:29.523 --> 30:31.655
I'll check and see if
any have gone missing.

30:31.655 --> 30:33.483
Oh, we'd appreciate that.

30:33.483 --> 30:35.007
Thanks, Rose.

30:35.007 --> 30:37.487
Yeah. Sorry I didn't get
back to you last week.

30:37.487 --> 30:40.839
After the way I messed things
up, I wouldn't have either.

30:47.149 --> 30:50.718
Wild guess--you
drunk-dialed your ex-wife?

30:50.718 --> 30:53.460
Worse.
I wasn't drunk at all.

30:53.460 --> 30:55.288
She's still using my
last name, though.

30:55.288 --> 30:56.724
So maybe there's hope.

30:56.724 --> 30:58.291
Maybe.

30:58.291 --> 31:03.252
Sometimes, though, it's
just hard to make a U-turn.

31:03.252 --> 31:05.515
Benson.

31:05.515 --> 31:07.213
Where?

31:14.263 --> 31:16.004
What the hell are
we looking at?

31:16.004 --> 31:19.181
Multiple fatalities.
Our guy fled the scene.

31:19.181 --> 31:20.313
On foot?

31:20.313 --> 31:21.618
Well, he tried
to assault a woman.

31:21.618 --> 31:23.229
She zapped him with a stun gun.

31:23.229 --> 31:25.927
Then her husband and another
couple of good Samaritans

31:25.927 --> 31:27.363
chased him off.

31:27.363 --> 31:28.799
Well, he couldn't
have gotten far.

31:28.799 --> 31:30.497
Unis are flooding
the neighborhood.

31:30.497 --> 31:33.195
We'll catch him.
- Good.

31:33.195 --> 31:37.939
Because now this guy
is also a murderer.

31:47.862 --> 31:48.254
<i>...</i>

31:48.254 --> 31:49.995
I was crossing into
the intersection.

31:49.995 --> 31:51.170
I-I had the green light.

31:51.170 --> 31:52.823
Nobody's blaming you.

31:52.823 --> 31:54.521
A second later, a car
pulled in front of me.

31:54.521 --> 31:55.870
I slammed the brakes.

31:55.870 --> 31:57.872
Did you see anyone
run from the scene?

31:57.872 --> 31:59.178
Uh, like who?

31:59.178 --> 32:00.527
Like a guy dressed
like an ambulance driver.

32:00.527 --> 32:03.182
No. It was hell,
and these girls all screaming.

32:03.182 --> 32:04.531
It was crazy.

32:04.531 --> 32:05.836
Everybody got out of
their cars yelling,

32:05.836 --> 32:07.447
looking for someone to blame.
- For the crash?

32:07.447 --> 32:09.492
It was like mob mentality.

32:09.492 --> 32:11.799
An EMT pulls up, just
trying to help some woman.

32:11.799 --> 32:13.453
Help her, how?

32:13.453 --> 32:14.976
He was trying to get her
into his ambulance.

32:14.976 --> 32:16.238
She started freaking out,
and her husband and a couple

32:16.238 --> 32:18.240
of guys started chasing him.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.982
And they all went that way.

32:20.982 --> 32:22.723
I thought he was a real EMT.

32:22.723 --> 32:24.986
He cut me out of my
seat belt, like...

32:24.986 --> 32:26.553
like he knew what he was doing.

32:26.553 --> 32:28.163
And then what happened?

32:28.163 --> 32:30.905
He started dragging me up
the street to his ambulance.

32:30.905 --> 32:34.691
He grabbed my breast,
tried to cut my clothes off.

32:34.691 --> 32:35.605
I tased him.

32:35.605 --> 32:38.478
I-I'm not sure they're legal.

32:38.478 --> 32:42.177
Listen, you saved yourself.
So good for you, okay?

32:42.177 --> 32:44.005
You're going to be okay.
- Liv.

32:44.005 --> 32:45.224
You're going to be okay.

32:45.224 --> 32:46.834
- Got a situation.
- What?

32:46.834 --> 32:48.836
They found our perp?
- Yeah.

32:48.836 --> 32:50.446
But there's a problem.
- What?

32:50.446 --> 32:52.971
He's got a hostage.

33:00.065 --> 33:02.806
- Hey.
- He's inside.

33:02.806 --> 33:04.983
Precinct commander and hostage
negotiation's on the way.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.027
He's not going anywhere.

33:06.027 --> 33:07.507
I want to talk to him.

33:07.507 --> 33:09.291
You ID the hostage?
- Yeah. Callie Burns, 50.

33:09.291 --> 33:10.858
She was out walking
her dog when

33:10.858 --> 33:12.947
this guy grabbed her and put
his EMT shears to his neck.

33:12.947 --> 33:14.296
Okay.

33:14.296 --> 33:15.819
No disrespect, Captain.

33:15.819 --> 33:16.995
But shouldn't we wait
for hostage negotiation?

33:16.995 --> 33:18.953
I'm not waiting.

33:18.953 --> 33:22.261
Sir, I'm Captain Benson.

33:22.261 --> 33:24.654
Someone who can help me?

33:24.654 --> 33:27.396
Well, first I need to make
sure that everybody is okay.

33:27.396 --> 33:29.137
Are you all right, ma'am?
- I didn't hurt you.

33:29.137 --> 33:30.225
Tell them!

33:30.225 --> 33:32.445
- He didn't hurt me.
- Good.

33:32.445 --> 33:33.924
That's good to know.

33:33.924 --> 33:35.404
Where's my dog?

33:35.404 --> 33:37.189
Your dog's okay, ma'am.
It's with a patrol officer.

33:37.189 --> 33:38.842
I don't care about her dog!

33:38.842 --> 33:42.455
So how about we talk about
what you do care about?

33:42.455 --> 33:44.848
I can see that you're married.

33:44.848 --> 33:46.285
25 years.

33:46.285 --> 33:47.808
Well, that's something
to be proud of.

33:47.808 --> 33:49.288
I am.

33:49.288 --> 33:50.506
She's not.

33:50.506 --> 33:52.595
Well, marriage
isn't always easy.

33:52.595 --> 33:54.641
But I'll tell you one thing.

33:54.641 --> 33:56.947
I'm sure that your wife
is worried about you.

33:56.947 --> 33:58.123
What's her name?

33:58.123 --> 34:00.864
Shari.

34:00.864 --> 34:02.214
She doesn't give
a crap about me.

34:02.214 --> 34:04.825
I love her, and she threw
that away, like garbage.

34:04.825 --> 34:07.784
Well, maybe you need
to tell her how you feel.

34:07.784 --> 34:11.092
How about... how about I get
her on the phone right now,

34:11.092 --> 34:12.093
and you two can talk.

34:12.093 --> 34:13.486
How does that sound?

34:13.486 --> 34:16.184
No, I want to talk
to her in person.

34:16.184 --> 34:17.838
Get her down here!

34:17.838 --> 34:19.579
Well, if I do that,
I'm going to need

34:19.579 --> 34:21.233
some assurances from you, okay?

34:21.233 --> 34:22.756
Get my wife down here.

34:22.756 --> 34:27.804
Make her apologize to my face,
and I'll let her go.

34:27.804 --> 34:30.285
All right.
Let-let me see what I can do.

34:30.285 --> 34:32.461
Just do it!

34:38.859 --> 34:40.991
- Who is this wingnut?
- Clark Young, 41.

34:40.991 --> 34:43.037
He works for the Department
of Weights and Measures.

34:43.037 --> 34:45.170
And in his off-hours, he
drives around pretending to be

34:45.170 --> 34:46.823
an EMT as a cover-up for rape?

34:46.823 --> 34:49.522
- That sums it up.
- Anything else?

34:49.522 --> 34:52.046
No record, no history
of mental illness.

34:52.046 --> 34:54.701
And yet, here we are.
Why are we still negotiating?

34:54.701 --> 34:55.832
We're making
positive progress,

34:55.832 --> 34:57.704
but he wants to
talk to his wife.

34:57.704 --> 34:59.488
- Does she want to talk to him?
- We're finding that out.

34:59.488 --> 35:01.055
Find out faster.

35:07.670 --> 35:09.542
Clark wants me to apologize?
For what?

35:09.542 --> 35:11.283
We were hoping
you could tell us.

35:11.283 --> 35:12.458
I don't understand
any of this.

35:12.458 --> 35:14.068
He's holding a woman hostage?

35:14.068 --> 35:15.678
Look, your husband might
not be who you think he is.

35:15.678 --> 35:17.158
Wait, what did he do?

35:17.158 --> 35:19.813
This ring is awfully shiny.
Is it new?

35:19.813 --> 35:21.902
- Clark gave it to me.
- When?

35:21.902 --> 35:24.209
Three nights ago.
He said it was an upgrade.

35:24.209 --> 35:26.080
That ring was not
your husband's to give.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.516
He took it from
a woman he sexually

35:27.516 --> 35:30.084
assaulted three nights ago.

35:30.084 --> 35:32.042
Is this because
I'm having an affair?

35:32.042 --> 35:33.740
Look. We're not marriage
counselors, okay?

35:33.740 --> 35:35.220
But you might be
on to something.

35:35.220 --> 35:36.569
You need to talk to
your husband, all right?

35:36.569 --> 35:39.137
- And say what?
- If I were you, I'd lie.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.703
Come on.

35:44.794 --> 35:46.492
Clark, I don't know
what you want me to say.

35:46.492 --> 35:47.928
I have to spell it
out for you?

35:47.928 --> 35:49.799
You can never just
apologize, can you?

35:49.799 --> 35:51.453
I'm sorry you feel
that way...

35:51.453 --> 35:52.759
That's not an apology!

35:52.759 --> 35:55.457
Hold on, Mrs. Young.

35:55.457 --> 35:56.850
Let's just take
a break here, okay?

35:56.850 --> 35:58.243
I don't know what he wants.

35:58.243 --> 35:59.940
He just wants to know
the affair is over

35:59.940 --> 36:01.246
and you still love him.
- But that's not true.

36:01.246 --> 36:02.986
It doesn't matter.
Just make him believe it.

36:02.986 --> 36:04.727
It's not like you haven't
lied about an affair before.

36:04.727 --> 36:06.033
Mrs. Young, you can do this.

36:06.033 --> 36:07.513
Hey, what's going
on over there?

36:07.513 --> 36:09.167
- Think about that woman.
- What are you telling her?

36:09.167 --> 36:11.691
- Okay? You know what to say.
- Huh?

36:15.129 --> 36:18.132
You know,
you're right, Clark.

36:18.132 --> 36:20.526
I-I suck at apologies.

36:20.526 --> 36:21.788
I always have.

36:21.788 --> 36:23.529
You always think
you're right.

36:23.529 --> 36:26.096
Yeah.
You are right this time.

36:26.096 --> 36:28.577
I...I apologize.

36:28.577 --> 36:30.927
I see that I've hurt you.

36:30.927 --> 36:34.801
Just tell me why you did it.

36:34.801 --> 36:37.934
I loved you too much.

36:39.414 --> 36:41.808
It made me feel vulnerable.

36:41.808 --> 36:43.592
And you know how messed
up my family was.

36:43.592 --> 36:45.203
I didn't know how to love.

36:46.682 --> 36:51.252
Maybe we could figure
that out together.

36:51.252 --> 36:54.690
I don't want to be with him.

36:54.690 --> 36:57.215
I still love you.

36:59.652 --> 37:01.871
I still love you, too.

37:03.960 --> 37:09.618
So, please, put that thing
down, and let's go home.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.537
Put it down.

37:17.452 --> 37:18.714
Okay.

37:19.585 --> 37:22.762
Hey!

37:23.502 --> 37:25.678
Stop!

37:30.204 --> 37:32.162
So the wife shows up,
says she loves him.

37:32.162 --> 37:34.817
And he just drops the
shears, and he confesses?

37:34.817 --> 37:36.776
Love works in
mysterious ways.

37:36.776 --> 37:38.604
So does adultery.

37:38.604 --> 37:41.215
Turns out his wife Shari
was banging

37:41.215 --> 37:43.043
that Greek used car
salesman I questioned.

37:43.043 --> 37:45.219
Ah.
So we can trust Bruno's nose.

37:45.219 --> 37:46.873
Like a truffle hound
when it comes to lies.

37:46.873 --> 37:48.178
Certainly makes
my life easier.

37:48.178 --> 37:49.484
I got the DNA.

37:49.484 --> 37:50.572
I got George
Kalazakis's dealer's

37:50.572 --> 37:52.182
permit in Clark's desk drawer.

37:52.182 --> 37:54.359
I got his wife wearing
one of the victim's rings.

37:54.359 --> 37:56.186
I'm charging this guy
with multiple counts

37:56.186 --> 37:57.623
of rape and homicide.

37:57.623 --> 37:59.233
Captain, Emma and
Josh are here to see

37:59.233 --> 38:01.235
you and Detective Bruno.

38:05.021 --> 38:06.545
I thought this
was lost forever.

38:06.545 --> 38:08.329
Never say never.

38:08.329 --> 38:11.245
You know, sometimes
things just work out.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.553
So what happens now?

38:14.553 --> 38:16.642
It's really up to you.

38:16.642 --> 38:18.296
There's probably not
going to be a trial,

38:18.296 --> 38:20.254
so you guys are good to go.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.518
Why-why would
he do this to us?

38:24.258 --> 38:26.565
I think that he
felt helpless and was

38:26.565 --> 38:28.480
trying to derive
power by making

38:28.480 --> 38:30.525
other men feel helpless, too.

38:30.525 --> 38:33.833
From now on, we're going
to protect each other.

38:33.833 --> 38:36.357
That sounds like a good plan.

38:36.357 --> 38:38.228
Good luck to you both.

38:43.538 --> 38:46.585
You had something in common
with that Clark guy, huh?

38:46.585 --> 38:48.978
A messed-up marriage?

38:48.978 --> 38:52.025
For the record,
Rose never cheated on me.

38:52.025 --> 38:53.505
I'm the idiot
who pushed her away.

38:53.505 --> 38:56.986
So you have time
to win her back.

38:56.986 --> 39:00.294
But in the meantime, I would
like you to take a few days

39:00.294 --> 39:01.774
to think about something.

39:01.774 --> 39:03.253
Yeah, what's that?

39:03.253 --> 39:06.866
Whether or not
you want that desk.

39:28.453 --> 39:31.151
<i>You know,
I grew up a lot like you.</i>

39:31.151 --> 39:33.501
<i>I've seen a lot of
people get murdered.</i>

39:33.501 --> 39:36.417
<i>And the second my
nuts dropped, my boss,</i>

39:36.417 --> 39:41.814
<i>he put a gun in my hand and
made me blow this guy away.</i>

39:44.643 --> 39:48.429
<i>He put a gun in my hand and
made me blow this guy away.</i>

39:48.429 --> 39:51.214
<i>I've never told anybody
that, until now.</i>

40:07.274 --> 40:10.408
So what do you
think about your buddy

40:10.408 --> 40:12.061
Velasco's murder confession?

40:12.061 --> 40:14.716
He would have said anything
to get that banger to flip.

40:14.716 --> 40:17.327
He's either a
really good liar, or...

40:17.327 --> 40:20.461
A great one.

40:20.461 --> 40:23.856
Well, either way,
one of my detectives

40:23.856 --> 40:25.684
may have just
confessed to murder.

40:25.684 --> 40:27.903
So I need to get to
the bottom of it.

40:27.903 --> 40:30.079
- How are we going to do that?
- Well, not we.

40:30.079 --> 40:31.690
Me.

40:31.690 --> 40:35.258
I want you to take
a few days off.

40:35.258 --> 40:37.696
And if he calls you,
don't pick up.

40:37.696 --> 40:40.568
Copy that, Captain.

40:40.568 --> 40:42.048
And Muncy.

40:42.048 --> 40:43.963
If you breathe a word
of this to Velasco...

40:43.963 --> 40:46.095
or anyone, for that matter...

40:46.095 --> 40:48.533
I will have you working the
foot post at the southeast

40:48.533 --> 40:50.578
corner of 42nd and 5th.

40:50.578 --> 40:52.493
On the midnight tour.

40:52.493 --> 40:53.886
We clear?

40:53.886 --> 40:55.801
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

41:36.537 --> 41:36.929
<i>...</i>
