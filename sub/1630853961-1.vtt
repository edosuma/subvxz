T-minus 15, 14, 13.

T-minus 10, nine, eight,

00:14.313 --> 00:17.516
seven, six, five,

00:17.583 --> 00:18.517
four...

00:18.584 --> 00:20.920
Main engine starts.

01:30.956 --> 01:33.926
[rock music plays]

01:36.762 --> 01:38.130
[speaking Russian]

01:42.501 --> 01:44.270
-Boo! -Ah!

01:44.336 --> 01:46.472
[laughing]

02:28.948 --> 02:30.416
[alarm blares]

02:33.285 --> 02:34.754
Speak English, they won’t understand you.

02:34.820 --> 02:36.355
Now, go. Go!

02:50.536 --> 02:51.804
[screaming]

02:52.972 --> 02:54.373
[roaring]

03:10.422 --> 03:11.957
[screaming]

03:23.402 --> 03:25.070
We can’t let these monsters escape!

03:25.137 --> 03:26.472
Once they get into the ocean,

03:26.539 --> 03:28.240
it’s over, they’ll be unstoppable.

03:28.307 --> 03:31.010
This is the only way to end it for good.

03:32.411 --> 03:33.345
Ah!

03:33.412 --> 03:34.613
What have we done?

03:34.680 --> 03:36.081
Let’s go, it can be fixed!

03:42.822 --> 03:44.490
[screams]

03:55.301 --> 03:56.902
They’re coming, they’re coming!

04:09.014 --> 04:10.583
I don’t know how to work this thing, do you?

04:10.649 --> 04:13.118
Don’t you remember your Cosmonaut training?

04:13.185 --> 04:14.386
Turn on the engines and hit the gas!

04:14.453 --> 04:15.955
[banging]

04:16.021 --> 04:17.356
Figure it out, Sergei!

04:17.423 --> 04:19.058
They’re about the break through!

04:21.026 --> 04:23.729
Sergei, hurry up! There’s more coming!

04:23.796 --> 04:26.365
Once we hit ten thousand meters, they’ll have no oxygen.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.367
Hurry up, they’re almost in!

04:30.736 --> 04:32.638
Nearly there!

04:32.705 --> 04:33.639
Sergei!

04:33.706 --> 04:35.040
I think I got it!

04:35.107 --> 04:36.842
I can’t overload it, but I can launch it!

04:36.909 --> 04:39.245
One minute starting now!

04:39.311 --> 04:42.147
I need more time, I need more time!

04:42.214 --> 04:44.650
I’ll give you more time.

04:44.717 --> 04:47.486
No, Aloysha! Come back!

04:47.553 --> 04:49.188
Okay.

04:51.857 --> 04:53.425
[roaring]

05:08.908 --> 05:10.309
[Sergei] Aloysha!

05:12.177 --> 05:13.646
[Sergei] Aloysha!

05:16.015 --> 05:18.684
No!

05:22.521 --> 05:23.956
[sighs]

06:11.770 --> 06:16.041
Check main booster, propellant diagnostics are green.

06:16.108 --> 06:18.744
Gyro navigation systems are online.

06:18.811 --> 06:21.613
Orbital stabilization thrusters purged and ready.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.349
This is Tabula Rasa to mission control,

06:23.415 --> 06:24.917
final walkthrough complete.

06:24.984 --> 06:26.719
All systems running at 100 percent.

06:26.785 --> 06:29.488
We have confirmed "go" for launch by all parties.

06:29.555 --> 06:32.024
T-minus nine minutes and counting.

06:32.091 --> 06:33.392
Roger that, mission control.

06:33.459 --> 06:34.727
Engineer Gilmour, what’s our status?

06:34.793 --> 06:38.063
Green across the board, Commander, and...

06:38.130 --> 06:39.832
and...

06:39.898 --> 06:44.136
ooh, oh, wow, I think I shouldn’t have had those tacos.

06:44.203 --> 06:46.005
I told you not to trust that food truck.

06:46.071 --> 06:48.007
I think it’s something else.

06:48.073 --> 06:49.808
Gilmour?

06:49.875 --> 06:52.244
I’ll just do a couple of tests.

06:55.448 --> 06:57.049
I’m just gonna touch here.

06:57.116 --> 06:58.050
Ah!

06:58.117 --> 06:58.851
Ah, ah!

06:58.918 --> 07:00.219
We got a possible appendicitis.

07:00.286 --> 07:01.220
No, no, no...

07:01.287 --> 07:02.688
Captain...

07:02.755 --> 07:04.590
-It’s just... mm. -She’s not clear to fly.

07:04.657 --> 07:06.092
Mission control, Engineer Gilmour

07:06.158 --> 07:07.593
has fallen ill and needs medical attention.

07:07.660 --> 07:09.128
We need to delay the launch.

07:09.195 --> 07:10.763
No can do, Commander.

07:10.830 --> 07:13.199
Delaying the launch would set us back six months.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.433
That’s going to be a huge setback

07:14.500 --> 07:16.068
that we can’t handle.

07:16.135 --> 07:20.006
We will alert the alternate. He’s standing by.

07:20.072 --> 07:21.240
Shit.

07:36.822 --> 07:42.695
Commander Tress, alternate astronaut is en route.

07:42.762 --> 07:45.298
Tabula Rasa, start auxiliary power units

07:45.364 --> 07:46.299
and activate APUs.

07:47.366 --> 07:49.735
APUs on.

07:49.802 --> 07:52.705
Felt like this day would never come.

07:52.772 --> 07:54.307
We are finally going to the moon.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.845
As long as the alternate shows up.

08:04.016 --> 08:05.585
Arming solid rocket booster

08:05.651 --> 08:06.586
Sequence ready.

08:06.652 --> 08:09.021
Arm and safe devices a go.

08:09.088 --> 08:11.390
The alternate should be joining you in a minute.

08:11.457 --> 08:13.893
SRBs and devices clear.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.728
I know none of us are happy about it,

08:15.795 --> 08:17.797
but he’s the best at what he does...

08:17.863 --> 08:20.232
maybe even better than Gilmour.

08:20.299 --> 08:22.668
We can’t delay this mission another six months.

08:25.471 --> 08:26.672
Howdy, boss.

08:26.739 --> 08:28.507
Prepped and ready to go to the moon.

08:28.574 --> 08:31.911
I hear the commute is a killer.

08:31.978 --> 08:33.346
Michael, for the last time,

08:33.412 --> 08:35.314
I’m not your boss, I’m your commander.

08:35.381 --> 08:37.116
Roger that, Commander.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.285
Begin aero surface profile test.

08:40.987 --> 08:44.957
Aero profile surface test activated, Commanderino.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.396
Mission control, profile test complete.

08:50.463 --> 08:51.764
Copy.

08:51.831 --> 08:54.133
Proceed with main engine gimbal profile test.

08:54.200 --> 08:57.036
Retract the gaseous vent arm.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.871
Michael, please take this seriously.

08:58.938 --> 09:01.407
This mission is far too important to humanity, got it?

09:01.474 --> 09:03.876
You don’t have to worry about me, Commander

09:03.943 --> 09:05.378
I’m here to work.

09:05.444 --> 09:07.146
Commander, power status.

09:09.348 --> 09:11.984
Power is running at 100 percent, no alarms.

09:12.051 --> 09:14.353
Transferring communication module power from ground

09:14.420 --> 09:15.788
to internal.

09:15.855 --> 09:19.225
Activating launchpad sound suppression system.

09:19.291 --> 09:23.796
Activating main engine burn-off in T-minus 10.

09:23.863 --> 09:25.665
Copy. Guidance is internal.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.066
We will begin ground launch sequencer

09:27.133 --> 09:28.601
for auto sequence start.

09:28.668 --> 09:29.969
We are still go.

09:30.036 --> 09:32.938
T-minus 27 seconds and counting, Commander.

09:33.005 --> 09:34.807
Roger that, mission control.

09:36.075 --> 09:37.410
Everyone ready to go to the moon?

09:40.880 --> 09:41.914
Oh shoot...

09:41.981 --> 09:43.482
What is it, Michael?

09:43.549 --> 09:45.184
I think I left my stove on.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.456
Remind me to not leave you alone in the galley.

09:52.124 --> 09:54.293
Luckily, NASA has ensured this ship

09:54.360 --> 09:56.495
is mitigated against all excessive heat forms,

09:56.562 --> 09:58.998
just so long as we don’t land in the Compton Belkovich

09:59.065 --> 10:00.466
volcanic complex on the far side,

10:00.533 --> 10:03.803
we should be safe, even from Liam’s cooking.

10:03.869 --> 10:05.071
[chuckling]

10:06.739 --> 10:11.510
Ten, nine, eight,

10:11.577 --> 10:12.845
seven...

10:12.912 --> 10:14.580
Starting main engine.

10:14.647 --> 10:16.549
six, five,

10:16.615 --> 10:18.918
four, three,

10:18.984 --> 10:21.387
two, one.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.123
Godspeed, Tabula Rasa.

10:24.190 --> 10:25.324
Roger that, mission control.

10:25.391 --> 10:26.625
Ignition.

10:26.692 --> 10:28.160
Liftoff.

10:32.765 --> 10:34.500
[cheering]

10:52.651 --> 10:54.787
There’s the thermosphere.

10:59.959 --> 11:01.494
Now for the exosphere.

11:09.869 --> 11:11.437
Wow.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.838
[sighs]

11:14.039 --> 11:16.075
Mission Control to Tabula Rasa.

11:16.142 --> 11:17.743
That is a successful launch.

11:17.810 --> 11:20.079
I repeat, a successful launch.

11:21.247 --> 11:23.015
Woo!

11:25.317 --> 11:28.554
Current navigation track to the moon appears clear

11:28.621 --> 11:31.690
and artificial gravity magnification is complete.

11:31.757 --> 11:33.125
Roger that, mission control.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.427
Tom, confirm navigation settings.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.831
Navigation settings confirmed.

11:38.898 --> 11:43.869
ETA to the moon, 68 hours, 42 minutes, and 15 seconds.

11:43.936 --> 11:46.105
That tracks with our settings.

11:46.172 --> 11:48.841
Signing off for now, but will continue to monitor.

11:48.908 --> 11:50.943
Congratulations, Tabula Rasa.

11:52.444 --> 11:54.046
Nice work, everyone.

11:54.113 --> 11:55.114
Now the real work begins.

11:55.181 --> 11:57.783
Gravity normalizers engaged.

11:57.850 --> 12:00.186
All right, I’ll be in the galley making popcorn,

12:00.252 --> 12:01.353
if anybody needs something.

12:01.420 --> 12:05.424
-[laughing] -What? C’mon.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.502
How’s it looking? Everything still on schedule?

12:16.569 --> 12:17.770
Uh, sure...

12:17.837 --> 12:20.606
just trying to make a renewable source of energy

12:20.673 --> 12:23.242
that will support generations of thousands of people

12:23.309 --> 12:26.312
living on the moon, no big deal.

12:26.378 --> 12:29.048
If anyone can make this fuel work, it’s you.

12:29.114 --> 12:31.317
You led the team that discovered what,

12:31.383 --> 12:33.819
a thousand new uses for algae?

12:33.886 --> 12:35.254
What’s one more, right?

12:35.321 --> 12:37.656
Thanks, Commander, that means a lot.

12:42.361 --> 12:46.031
You know, my dad keeps saying if we’re successful,

12:46.098 --> 12:48.934
they’ll have towns on the moon named after us soon enough.

12:49.001 --> 12:51.303
Think about it...

12:51.370 --> 12:52.838
Adams City.

12:52.905 --> 12:54.106
Tressburg.

12:54.173 --> 12:57.042
Don’t go looking for condos just yet.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.077
Go for Commander Tress.

12:58.143 --> 12:59.778
Go for Tress.

12:59.845 --> 13:03.182
Commander, we have a bit of electromagnetic disturbance,

13:03.249 --> 13:05.451
probably due to the Van Allen radiation belt.

13:05.517 --> 13:07.152
It’s nothing out of the ordinary, but...

13:07.219 --> 13:08.754
What does that mean?

13:08.821 --> 13:11.223
We’ve been on a bit of a run, but we should be fine.

13:11.290 --> 13:13.459
But we’ll have to adjust our landing by a degree.

13:13.525 --> 13:16.061
But we should still be able to land in the West Crater.

13:16.128 --> 13:18.497
Keep an eye on it.

13:18.564 --> 13:19.698
Let Ellie and mission control know right away.

13:19.765 --> 13:21.367
Henri and Michael as well.

13:21.433 --> 13:23.469
Copy, we’re having trouble reaching out to mission control

13:23.535 --> 13:25.905
due to the interference, but I’ll keep trying.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.640
Roger that.

13:27.706 --> 13:29.308
I’m about to go on my sleep shift, but don’t hesitate

13:29.375 --> 13:31.577
to wake me the second anything changes.

13:33.545 --> 13:36.582
Are we okay, Commander?

13:36.649 --> 13:38.284
Be ready for anything.

13:38.350 --> 13:39.985
I’m gonna get some shut-eye.

13:40.052 --> 13:41.420
I suggest you do the same.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.589
It’ll be all hands once we make our approach.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.291
Sounds good, Commander.

13:58.070 --> 13:59.438
Quequio satellite sighted.

14:01.974 --> 14:03.809
Navigation holding steady?

14:03.876 --> 14:08.480
Yes, current descent is only 46 feet from our initial site.

14:08.547 --> 14:10.716
Final run-through at 100 percent,

14:10.783 --> 14:14.987
confirmed by Michael, Henri, and yours truly.

14:15.054 --> 14:16.655
Come in, Commander Tress,

14:16.722 --> 14:19.758
we are ready to initiate orbital lunar descent.

14:19.825 --> 14:21.694
Confirmed.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.729
Tabula Rasa Crew, report to command module

14:23.796 --> 14:25.297
for initial orbital lunar descent

14:25.364 --> 14:27.299
in T-minus 5 minutes and counting.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.372
Go back, go back!

14:33.439 --> 14:34.473
Whoa...

14:34.540 --> 14:36.942
Everyone, get your asses up here, now!

14:37.009 --> 14:38.310
[alarm blares]

14:42.915 --> 14:44.516
Status report.

14:44.583 --> 14:46.852
Commander, we are reading that you are veering off-course

14:46.919 --> 14:49.355
by 24.2 degrees, please advise.

14:53.125 --> 14:54.960
We’re not getting back on-course.

14:55.027 --> 14:56.929
Mission control, we had some interference from the Van Allen,

14:56.996 --> 14:58.530
but we course-corrected.

14:58.597 --> 15:00.065
There’s no way it’s causing this much interference.

15:00.132 --> 15:02.568
Copy, Tabula Rasa.

15:02.634 --> 15:03.569
We suggest, uh...

15:03.635 --> 15:04.970
[static]

15:05.037 --> 15:06.171
Hello?

15:06.238 --> 15:08.574
Hello, mission control, do you copy?

15:11.543 --> 15:13.145
Mission control, I repeat, do you copy?

15:13.212 --> 15:14.346
We lost them.

15:14.413 --> 15:15.781
Henri, Michael, we need a diagnostic

15:15.848 --> 15:17.883
of the electrical components of the nav system.

15:17.950 --> 15:20.252
-On it. -Copy, boss.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.159
The hardware’s fried, the system’s completely overloaded.

15:27.226 --> 15:30.629
Something’s scrambling the computer to continually reset.

15:30.696 --> 15:32.865
My electromagnetic readings are off the charts.

15:32.931 --> 15:36.068
Interference shouldn’t increase exponentially like this.

15:39.938 --> 15:43.575
I’m not getting control, we need to do something, now.

15:43.642 --> 15:44.576
Restart the ship.

15:44.643 --> 15:45.544
What?

15:45.611 --> 15:47.112
We should regain emergency control.

15:47.179 --> 15:48.747
Oxygen and gravity are on separate systems,

15:48.814 --> 15:49.782
so those should hold.

15:49.848 --> 15:50.849
Captain, that’s insane.

15:50.916 --> 15:52.351
But Commander, we have no time.

15:52.418 --> 15:54.253
We’ll be propelled to the far side

15:54.319 --> 15:55.687
in T-minus 95 seconds.

15:55.754 --> 15:57.623
It’s either this, or we crash and explode.

15:57.689 --> 15:59.224
Restart the ship.

16:22.948 --> 16:24.383
She’s holding.

16:24.450 --> 16:26.185
She’s holding.

16:29.354 --> 16:31.857
Wait... navigation’s not course-correcting.

16:31.924 --> 16:33.625
Sixty seconds till we’re flung to the far side.

16:33.692 --> 16:35.461
We need to manually maneuver the ship.

16:35.527 --> 16:38.931
Michael, can you slow us down by adjusting the rocket boosters?

16:38.997 --> 16:41.567
I can keep us flying long enough to not go "kaboom."

16:41.633 --> 16:43.569
We’ll be flung to the far side of the moon before then.

16:43.635 --> 16:45.571
If that happens we need to get

16:45.637 --> 16:47.172
as close as possible to the Von Kármán crater.

16:47.239 --> 16:48.407
We can use parts from the Chang’e-4 lander

16:48.474 --> 16:50.275
and Yutu-2 rover to fix the ship.

16:50.342 --> 16:53.445
Michael, Henri, adjust the rockets, slow us down.

16:53.512 --> 16:56.281
On it.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.550
When we land, we can use the Quequio relay satellite

16:58.617 --> 17:00.085
to make contact.

17:00.152 --> 17:02.888
That’s the only thing on the far side that can reach Earth.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.923
Assuming we land in one piece.

17:08.594 --> 17:09.528
Okay.

17:12.965 --> 17:14.099
Anything?

17:14.166 --> 17:15.567
It’s not working.

17:23.909 --> 17:25.277
That was the satellite.

17:25.344 --> 17:26.979
We won’t be able to contact mission control.

17:27.045 --> 17:29.214
That won’t matter if we don’t survive this landing.

17:29.281 --> 17:31.183
Michael, Henri, the rockets.

17:32.050 --> 17:33.352
Nothing yet, Commander.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.355
Keep her as steady as possible.

17:36.421 --> 17:37.856
Roger that, Commander.

17:43.529 --> 17:46.298
It’s not working, we have to do it manually.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.010
Anything?

17:58.076 --> 17:59.912
It’s working.

17:59.978 --> 18:02.181
[garbled transmission]

18:02.247 --> 18:05.217
...right for the Chang’e 4!

18:05.284 --> 18:06.885
Brace for impact!

18:10.055 --> 18:11.423
[grunting]

18:24.002 --> 18:25.571
Michael, Henri, are you okay?

18:29.007 --> 18:30.275
All good, Commander.

18:42.221 --> 18:43.555
We’re locked out of the systems.

18:46.758 --> 18:49.795
We need to figure out a way to get back to Earth...

18:49.861 --> 18:51.463
now.

18:56.268 --> 18:58.403
Status report... is anyone hurt?

18:58.470 --> 19:00.772
Negative, Commander, we’re all good here.

19:00.839 --> 19:02.574
System says no hull breaches, either.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.210
But that Chang’e 4 rover was our best chance

19:05.277 --> 19:06.645
to communicate with mission control.

19:06.712 --> 19:08.046
It doesn’t matter.

19:08.113 --> 19:10.048
The satellite’s gone, and the only thing

19:10.115 --> 19:13.151
on the far side of the moon that can communicate with Earth,

19:13.218 --> 19:14.620
we destroyed.

19:16.088 --> 19:17.389
I’ll never see my dad again.

19:17.456 --> 19:20.025
We won’t see anyone again.

19:20.092 --> 19:22.194
Mission control knows we crashed on the far side.

19:22.261 --> 19:24.329
If they don’t hear from us in the next few hours,

19:24.396 --> 19:26.565
the best they can try to do any time soon

19:26.632 --> 19:27.899
will be to figure out a way to communicate.

19:27.966 --> 19:29.568
But that could take days or longer,

19:29.635 --> 19:31.937
especially without the Quequio satellite.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.438
We’re all alive.

19:33.505 --> 19:36.441
We need to assess and see what’s available, and for how long.

19:36.508 --> 19:39.244
We’ll probably have to get back on our own.

19:39.311 --> 19:40.679
Of course.

19:40.746 --> 19:42.347
Tom, Henri, status report?

19:43.482 --> 19:45.817
We’ve lost most of our power.

19:45.884 --> 19:49.254
Owen, please tell me life support is still functional.

19:49.321 --> 19:50.322
Okay, okay...

19:50.389 --> 19:51.523
Um...

19:53.091 --> 19:54.526
we should be okay on oxygen.

19:54.593 --> 19:56.261
We have enough in reserve to last six months.

19:56.328 --> 19:59.698
Our food source is supposed to mimic that as well.

19:59.765 --> 20:02.067
We are equipped to grow vegetation,

20:02.134 --> 20:04.770
so we should get some fresh food if we’re here for a while.

20:04.836 --> 20:06.605
And so long as there aren’t any hull breaches

20:06.672 --> 20:08.674
and no one opens any doors or windows,

20:08.740 --> 20:11.343
we should be able to maintain a moderate temperature

20:11.410 --> 20:13.612
inside the modules for months.

20:13.679 --> 20:16.815
And if there aren’t any leaks, we’ll be fine.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.084
I’ll do a walkthrough, then a moonwalk,

20:19.151 --> 20:21.119
to ensure there’s no external damage.

20:21.186 --> 20:24.156
See? We’re all safe.

20:24.222 --> 20:26.591
How far away are we from the Yutu-2 rover?

20:26.658 --> 20:29.695
Rough estimate, about a mile.

20:29.761 --> 20:32.831
Is there any way to contact mission control from the Yutu-2?

20:32.898 --> 20:35.801
No, the only way to reach Earth from the far side

20:35.867 --> 20:37.469
was through the Quequio relay satellite.

20:37.536 --> 20:40.372
Which we destroyed.

20:40.439 --> 20:41.840
Exactly.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.009
So, Michael, Henri, you’re coming with me

20:44.076 --> 20:47.412
to retrieve whatever components we can from the Yutu-2 rover,

20:47.479 --> 20:49.681
use it to get Tabula Rasa up and running,

20:49.748 --> 20:51.583
at least to the near side, so we can make contact.

20:51.650 --> 20:53.051
I’m coming too.

20:53.118 --> 20:54.820
The Yutu-2 houses several spectrometers.

20:54.886 --> 20:56.688
I could pull a whole one or scavenge it for parts.

20:56.755 --> 20:58.690
No, if it’s operational, we’ll drive it back here.

20:58.757 --> 20:59.691
You can get what you need from it then.

20:59.758 --> 21:01.393
And what if it’s not?

21:01.460 --> 21:04.496
Then we’ll be missing out on potentially life-saving tech.

21:05.997 --> 21:07.132
Fine.

21:07.199 --> 21:09.167
Ellie, I need the rest of you to take stock

21:09.234 --> 21:10.402
of all the damage you can find.

21:10.469 --> 21:11.737
Make sure all supplies and experiments

21:11.803 --> 21:12.738
are still operational, and if possible,

21:12.804 --> 21:14.506
chart a course back home.

21:14.573 --> 21:16.408
We’ll need every bit of oxygen, water,

21:16.475 --> 21:17.843
and sustenance accounted for.

21:17.909 --> 21:19.344
We could be here for a while.

21:19.411 --> 21:21.079
We’re on it, Commander.

21:21.146 --> 21:22.714
And Josie, make sure the life support module

21:22.781 --> 21:24.049
is fully operational.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.184
If that breaks, we have no chance of going back.

21:26.251 --> 21:28.253
Copy, Commander.

21:28.320 --> 21:31.423
All right, team, let’s suit up.

21:44.302 --> 21:47.706
All right, it’s at least a 20-minute hike.

21:47.773 --> 21:50.375
Everyone keep an eye on your vitals.

21:50.442 --> 21:52.711
-Copy that, Commander. -Copy.

21:52.778 --> 21:54.846
Copy that, Commander.

21:54.913 --> 21:56.114
Follow me.

21:59.551 --> 22:02.187
Come on, guys, we’re the first humans

22:02.254 --> 22:05.724
to set foot on the far side of the moon.

22:05.791 --> 22:09.027
Guys, we’re a part of history no matter what now.

22:18.270 --> 22:20.138
Stupid things!

22:25.811 --> 22:27.279
Did you see that?

22:27.345 --> 22:28.580
See what?

22:28.647 --> 22:31.249
I don’t know, it looked Cyrillic...

22:31.316 --> 22:32.751
Russian, maybe.

22:32.818 --> 22:35.487
Russian? That’s odd.

22:35.554 --> 22:37.622
If anything, we probably picked up

22:37.689 --> 22:39.658
some Chinese characters from the Yutu-2.

22:39.724 --> 22:41.760
No, no, no, it for sure wasn’t that.

22:41.827 --> 22:43.762
Let me see if I can get it pulled back up.

22:43.829 --> 22:45.597
We have more important things to do.

22:45.664 --> 22:47.132
Come on, can we finish this walkthrough?

22:47.199 --> 22:48.867
Fine.

23:02.747 --> 23:06.551
Well, Liam, it appears to be working.

23:06.618 --> 23:09.788
Aren’t you glad I came, Commander?

23:09.855 --> 23:11.490
Okay, let’s take what we need and head back.

23:11.556 --> 23:14.659
The less of our oxygen reserves we use out here, the better.

23:15.961 --> 23:17.028
Jackpot.

23:19.431 --> 23:21.166
Oh, shoot.

23:21.233 --> 23:24.102
What is it, Liam?

23:24.169 --> 23:25.203
Bloody nose.

23:25.270 --> 23:27.305
I hit my face pretty bad during the crash.

23:27.372 --> 23:30.008
Liam, have Owen check you out the second we get back.

23:35.046 --> 23:37.215
Captain, I think you should see this.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.359
A volcanic reaction?

23:47.425 --> 23:48.860
Unlikely...

23:48.927 --> 23:50.328
nothing under the moon should cause ripples like that.

23:50.395 --> 23:52.998
The moon has magma, but no active volcanoes.

23:53.064 --> 23:55.367
Even if we’re under a magma chamber, there’s no way.

23:55.433 --> 23:57.035
Tracks?

23:57.102 --> 23:59.771
From what, a giant moon snake?

24:00.672 --> 24:02.207
The rover?

24:03.675 --> 24:06.811
No, tire tread doesn’t match.

24:11.216 --> 24:13.752
Back to the ship, leave the rover!

24:20.759 --> 24:22.227
What are those?

24:22.294 --> 24:23.895
Sharks?

24:49.888 --> 24:53.491
Why are there sharks on the moon?

24:53.558 --> 24:55.060
Look, it’s not moving.

24:55.126 --> 24:57.295
I think someone must have set a trap.

24:57.362 --> 25:00.966
Okay, but who set the trap?

25:04.569 --> 25:06.304
Ah!

25:16.414 --> 25:18.283
[speaks Russian]

25:27.425 --> 25:30.996
How are they breathing?

25:31.062 --> 25:33.298
Uh, I think they just spoke...

25:33.365 --> 25:35.266
Russian?

25:35.333 --> 25:40.572
First there were giant sharks, now there are Russians?

25:40.639 --> 25:42.040
You think they’re friendly?

25:42.107 --> 25:44.976
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

25:56.888 --> 25:58.089
Americans...

25:59.724 --> 26:02.027
Welcome to the moon!

26:14.105 --> 26:17.776
For the record, this was not in the brochure.

26:21.946 --> 26:23.381
I didn’t think it would be the Americans

26:23.448 --> 26:27.152
who will lead my rescue operation, but how do you say...

26:27.218 --> 26:31.256
beggars can’t be choosers.

26:31.322 --> 26:33.692
A rescue mission?

26:33.758 --> 26:35.193
Who are you?

26:35.260 --> 26:37.295
You weren’t sent here to rescue me?

26:39.531 --> 26:40.999
After 40 years on the moon,

26:41.066 --> 26:44.903
I assumed somebody would want to bring me back!

26:44.969 --> 26:47.372
[speaks Russian]

26:50.075 --> 26:54.012
Papa, we’re going to get you back home.

26:54.079 --> 26:56.648
Don’t give up hope.

26:56.715 --> 26:58.249
What is the point?

26:58.316 --> 27:00.552
I’m an old man, I’ve literally watched the world

27:00.618 --> 27:04.389
pass me by more times than I can remember.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.857
Maybe...

27:05.924 --> 27:07.459
maybe it’s time to assume...

27:07.525 --> 27:12.397
actually, to accept that no one is coming.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.598
Don’t say that.

27:13.665 --> 27:15.366
Yes, she’s right.

27:15.433 --> 27:17.669
We’re more than happy to bring you back with us, both of you.

27:17.736 --> 27:19.804
We just need to fix our ship first.

27:19.871 --> 27:22.841
See, Papa? We’re going home.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.889
What is up with her back?

27:37.956 --> 27:39.858
Michael, stop. They just saved us.

27:46.264 --> 27:47.799
I’m... I’m sorry.

27:50.468 --> 27:52.470
Okay, let me officially introduce ourselves.

27:52.537 --> 27:55.573
My name is Sergei, and this is Akula.

27:58.076 --> 28:00.044
And she’s my daughter...

28:01.579 --> 28:03.348
Adopted daughter.

28:03.414 --> 28:06.251
I’m sorry, I...

28:06.317 --> 28:07.685
No problem.

28:07.752 --> 28:12.357
But hey, if you ever will try to touch my daughter again,

28:12.423 --> 28:14.325
I will make the arrangement to send you back home

28:14.392 --> 28:16.361
in a plastic bag, you understood?

28:19.164 --> 28:21.099
Look, I’m sorry about my crewmate.

28:21.166 --> 28:23.935
We can take you back to Earth with us,

28:24.002 --> 28:26.738
but first we need to know who you really are,

28:26.805 --> 28:28.006
and what you’re doing here.

28:28.072 --> 28:30.341
There’s no time for it.

28:30.408 --> 28:32.677
The hybrids can return any moment.

28:32.744 --> 28:36.147
I have a rover just towards this ledge, let’s go.

28:36.214 --> 28:39.450
Good, I can guide you back to my ship.

28:39.517 --> 28:40.952
Are you sure it’s a good idea to have them

28:41.019 --> 28:42.287
bring us to their ship?

28:42.353 --> 28:44.556
We may be followed, and their ship

28:44.622 --> 28:47.158
is our best bet to get off this stupid rock.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.960
Mm.

28:49.027 --> 28:50.895
Good looking forward.

28:50.962 --> 28:53.064
Okay, change of the plans.

28:53.131 --> 28:56.034
Now we go to our base and gather our supplies,

28:56.100 --> 28:58.303
and when it’s safe, we return to your ship

28:58.369 --> 29:01.940
and figure out how we can get back to Earth.

29:02.006 --> 29:03.975
Last I checked, I was the commander here.

29:04.042 --> 29:06.277
I need to get back to my ship.

29:06.344 --> 29:09.480
Well, we either all go to my ship

29:09.547 --> 29:14.319
and wipe them off your trail, or we go separate ways.

29:14.385 --> 29:16.254
They will follow you, find you,

29:16.321 --> 29:19.023
kill you and every member of your crew.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.459
Does it still sound like a good idea to you?

29:23.261 --> 29:26.197
Fine, lead the way...

29:26.264 --> 29:27.432
for now.

29:40.511 --> 29:43.548
Quickly, get on. They’re not far.

29:43.615 --> 29:46.851
I’m sorry it’s a tight fit, I wasn’t expecting guests.

29:46.918 --> 29:48.319
Okay, come on, guys, make some room.

29:48.386 --> 29:49.454
Come on.

29:50.722 --> 29:52.123
Ah!

29:53.524 --> 29:54.959
Henri!

29:55.026 --> 29:56.961
Hurry! Drive, we have to save him!

29:57.028 --> 29:58.129
What are you waiting for, let’s go!

29:58.196 --> 30:00.431
They will lead us into a trap.

30:00.498 --> 30:02.567
If they were going to kill him, they would have done so.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.369
If they’re not gonna kill him, what are they doing?

30:04.435 --> 30:07.205
They’re taking him hostage.

30:07.272 --> 30:09.474
I have to warn my crew.

30:09.540 --> 30:10.541
No, you don’t.

30:10.608 --> 30:12.176
Get off me, I have to warn my crew!

30:12.243 --> 30:13.311
I’m not gonna let them die!

30:13.378 --> 30:14.712
If you don’t want them to die,

30:14.779 --> 30:16.547
then don’t talk to them over the radio.

30:16.614 --> 30:18.683
The electromagnetic waves will lead sharks

30:18.750 --> 30:20.985
straight to your ship, and to your crew.

30:21.052 --> 30:23.154
They won’t get a chance.

30:26.925 --> 30:28.226
We have to save Henri.

30:28.293 --> 30:30.328
I’m not leaving another member of my crew.

30:30.395 --> 30:33.298
And we will, but going in there now, unprepared,

30:33.364 --> 30:36.067
with what you’re wearing, is a suicide mission.

30:36.134 --> 30:37.735
We will get supplies at our base.

30:46.978 --> 30:49.247
Where’s my helmet?

30:49.314 --> 30:50.748
How can I breathe down here?

31:02.727 --> 31:04.362
[speaks Russian]

31:28.019 --> 31:30.621
Hey! Let me out of here!

31:31.856 --> 31:33.257
I am Tzarina Selah.

31:33.324 --> 31:34.692
I’m sure you have questions.

31:36.861 --> 31:38.096
So do I.

31:48.339 --> 31:50.675
Quickly, no time to lose.

31:56.147 --> 31:57.648
Welcome to my abode.

32:03.421 --> 32:07.225
It’ll take your body a minute to adjust to the oxygen

32:07.291 --> 32:10.094
filling the ship from my algea crop.

32:10.161 --> 32:12.230
You can take off your masks then.

32:25.109 --> 32:28.379
So, now, we can talk.

32:35.119 --> 32:37.855
Okay, I got one question.

32:39.257 --> 32:41.125
How are you still alive?

32:44.562 --> 32:46.664
Okay, I have some serious questions.

32:46.731 --> 32:50.468
Why doesn’t she need a suit?

32:50.535 --> 32:51.669
Or oxygen?

32:51.736 --> 32:54.272
I knew there was something "fishy" about her.

32:54.338 --> 32:55.773
He was right.

32:57.275 --> 32:58.409
I’m one of them.

32:59.610 --> 33:02.713
Created to survive in all conditions.

33:08.319 --> 33:12.090
Man, this day just keeps getting weirder and weirder.

33:12.156 --> 33:18.162
Scouting an abandoned camp for supplies, I came across her.

33:18.229 --> 33:20.398
She was absolutely healthy...

33:20.465 --> 33:22.900
hungry, but healthy.

33:22.967 --> 33:26.070
He saved my life, raised me as his own,

33:26.137 --> 33:27.572
and taught me everything he knows.

33:27.638 --> 33:30.241
I grew up listening to his homeland’s music,

33:30.308 --> 33:33.144
and reading the books of his people.

33:33.211 --> 33:36.347
The ship had a fine audio system.

33:37.215 --> 33:39.250
Thank God for Tchaikovsky,

33:39.317 --> 33:40.618
"Swan Lake" was the only thing

33:40.685 --> 33:42.920
that could put me to sleep as a child.

33:42.987 --> 33:44.255
Have you heard of it?

33:44.322 --> 33:45.656
Yes, we’ve heard of "Swan Lake."

33:45.723 --> 33:49.727
It’s a classic back on Earth.

33:49.794 --> 33:52.563
But I’m actually a rock and roll guy, you know?

33:52.630 --> 33:55.266
But I was not able to put my hands on it.

33:55.333 --> 33:57.468
I even saw Elton in Moscow, in...

33:57.535 --> 33:59.403
Wait, wait, you saw... you saw Elton John?

33:59.470 --> 34:01.506
Yes, this thing was the best one, eh?

34:01.572 --> 34:03.608
Can we get back on topic, please?

34:05.810 --> 34:10.181
Okay, as much as her music taste,

34:10.248 --> 34:12.583
Akula became better than me in many respects.

34:12.650 --> 34:17.321
She even made some devices I wasn’t able to survive without.

34:17.388 --> 34:19.390
So, speaking of...

34:19.457 --> 34:23.661
here, upgraded suits.

34:25.263 --> 34:29.600
They were my prototype, but they still work.

34:29.667 --> 34:32.403
They block body heat and electromagnetic frequencies,

34:32.470 --> 34:34.639
rendering us invisible to them.

34:34.705 --> 34:36.407
While keeping your own body heat

34:36.474 --> 34:39.544
to protect you from the frigid moon’s temperatures.

34:39.610 --> 34:42.380
They also utilize an infrared communicator,

34:42.446 --> 34:45.683
which converts sound to be undetectable.

34:45.750 --> 34:48.319
And the oxygen?

34:48.386 --> 34:50.087
Same like hybrids...

34:50.154 --> 34:51.822
I convert my own.

34:51.889 --> 34:56.861
So, they able to have it by consume algae they harvest,

34:56.928 --> 35:00.798
and I able to extract it from the containers I grow them in.

35:00.865 --> 35:04.068
So, that’s why my ship is full of oxygen,

35:04.135 --> 35:10.007
and I put some on my back, you know, in my suit.

35:10.074 --> 35:11.175
Like a makeshift oxygen tank.

35:11.242 --> 35:12.643
Yes.

35:12.710 --> 35:16.247
Impressive, but why are there hybrid sharks on the moon

35:16.314 --> 35:17.515
in the first place?

35:17.582 --> 35:22.420
Well, I was a very young scientist,

35:22.486 --> 35:24.822
but always dreamed to become a cosmonaut.

35:24.889 --> 35:27.892
"The great gig in the sky," I always told myself.

35:27.959 --> 35:31.896
But we had a better and straight goal

35:31.963 --> 35:33.097
from the government...

35:33.164 --> 35:35.833
we have to declare the moon Soviet property.

35:35.900 --> 35:38.402
You had just left your footprint on it,

35:38.469 --> 35:40.738
and we were going to build cities.

35:40.805 --> 35:46.611
So, our government created these sharks, these hybrids,

35:46.677 --> 35:51.015
to become Cold War weapons against the United States.

35:51.082 --> 35:55.086
So, my colleague and I lured them on the rocket

35:55.152 --> 36:00.157
to make sure they wouldn’t invade Earth.

36:00.224 --> 36:02.026
But you’re the only one here.

36:02.093 --> 36:03.427
What happened to the other guy?

36:03.494 --> 36:07.398
He sacrificed himself so that I could live.

36:11.469 --> 36:13.070
Sergei, I’m so sorry.

36:14.505 --> 36:16.607
How did you manage to survive so long?

36:16.674 --> 36:20.077
Well, the ship was filled with experiments.

36:20.144 --> 36:21.479
I was able to grow my own food,

36:21.545 --> 36:23.748
collect evaporated water from plants,

36:23.814 --> 36:28.286
and algae helped me to survive.

36:28.352 --> 36:30.621
We found water, drilled underground.

36:30.688 --> 36:32.990
It’s not very good, but we survive.

36:33.057 --> 36:35.226
Look, I hate to break up this Q and A,

36:35.293 --> 36:39.897
but a man is being tortured by giant shark people.

36:39.964 --> 36:42.266
Michael’s right, every second we’re here

36:42.333 --> 36:44.101
is a second we’re not saving Henri.

36:47.338 --> 36:48.606
Where did they take him?

36:48.673 --> 36:50.441
The hybrids developed a settlement

36:50.508 --> 36:52.109
inside the largest crater in the area.

36:52.176 --> 36:55.212
He’s likely being held there.

36:55.279 --> 36:56.547
We need to get there now.

36:56.614 --> 36:57.848
Henri’s our mechanic.

36:57.915 --> 37:01.452
We can’t repair the ship without him.

37:01.519 --> 37:02.820
Let’s boogie.

37:02.887 --> 37:06.424
The sharks are probably off our trail by now.

37:10.528 --> 37:12.563
We need to try and communicate with the ship.

37:12.630 --> 37:14.565
We need to warn the crew at all costs.

37:14.632 --> 37:17.768
They need to avoid using anything electromagnetic.

37:17.835 --> 37:20.705
I think you’re right.

37:20.771 --> 37:22.073
Don’t let them see me.

37:24.141 --> 37:25.943
Hey, you saw Elton John?

37:26.010 --> 37:29.246
Man, I’ve been trying, never got a chance to.

37:29.313 --> 37:30.848
Ellie.

37:30.915 --> 37:33.317
Ellie, if you can hear this, do not respond...

37:33.384 --> 37:35.119
I repeat, do not respond.

37:35.186 --> 37:37.588
The ship is in danger of being attacked.

37:39.190 --> 37:42.860
Any luck restoring electricity to the ship?

37:42.927 --> 37:45.129
Not yet.

37:45.196 --> 37:48.299
I repeat, do not respond using anything electromagnetic.

37:48.366 --> 37:50.534
It could draw them to the ship for an attack.

37:50.601 --> 37:53.671
Come in... Commander? Commander Tress!

37:53.738 --> 37:55.706
-It’s not safe. -Nicole!

38:01.912 --> 38:03.414
What was that?

38:03.481 --> 38:05.082
I don’t know.

38:05.149 --> 38:06.817
What could be taking them so long?

38:06.884 --> 38:08.552
It sounded like she was in trouble.

38:08.619 --> 38:09.653
We have to go out after them.

38:09.720 --> 38:11.188
What? No, no, no.

38:11.255 --> 38:12.590
We were given explicit orders to remain on the ship.

38:12.656 --> 38:14.992
Nicole put me in charge.

38:15.059 --> 38:17.428
They should have been back by now, they’re not responding.

38:17.495 --> 38:19.163
What if they’re hurt?

38:19.230 --> 38:21.365
I need you to grab your medical gear and come with me.

38:21.432 --> 38:24.034
-But... -No buts!

38:24.101 --> 38:27.838
Josie, Tom, continue running diagnostics.

38:27.905 --> 38:31.642
Owen, we have a crew to find.

38:44.789 --> 38:47.024
Ah... I swear, I don’t know where the ship is!

38:47.091 --> 38:49.093
The crash took us so far off-course, I... I...

38:49.160 --> 38:51.028
I just want your ship.

38:51.095 --> 38:53.931
You and your crew can have everything we leave behind.

38:53.998 --> 38:56.567
Build your little colony in peace.

38:56.634 --> 38:58.769
We are going home.

38:58.836 --> 39:00.070
Home?

39:00.137 --> 39:03.941
Yes, the mother planet to us both. Earth.

39:04.008 --> 39:06.811
Wait, wait, wait... you’re from Earth?

39:09.046 --> 39:12.817
Yes, I will rule there as I rule here.

39:12.883 --> 39:16.587
Now tell me... where is your ship?

39:16.654 --> 39:19.423
I... I can’t tell you.

39:19.490 --> 39:22.526
That’s a shame. Scar!

39:29.333 --> 39:31.368
Ah, my leg, ah!

39:31.435 --> 39:34.572
Ah!

39:36.474 --> 39:38.876
[screaming]

39:44.815 --> 39:49.019
Now tell us, or die!

39:49.086 --> 39:51.489
Okay. Okay. But you have to...

39:51.555 --> 39:53.224
you have to promise me...

39:53.290 --> 39:54.892
promise me you won’t hurt my crew.

39:54.959 --> 39:59.763
On my honor as Tzarina, ruler of the Hybrid sharks.

40:04.502 --> 40:08.038
Scar, prepare the guards We’re taking the ship.

40:08.105 --> 40:09.673
[panting]

40:10.875 --> 40:12.243
Ah!

40:19.016 --> 40:21.986
Heh, if Elton John could see me now, right?

40:22.052 --> 40:24.855
Yeah, you’re a rocket man now.

40:28.826 --> 40:31.428
What... what are these made of?

40:31.495 --> 40:33.130
Sharpened moonstone...

40:33.197 --> 40:35.666
the only thing sharp enough to pierce the sharks’ hides.

40:35.733 --> 40:38.869
This stone has more crystalline structure,

40:38.936 --> 40:41.505
and it’s hold sharp edge for extremely long time.

40:41.572 --> 40:45.910
You two really have thought of everything, haven’t you?

40:45.976 --> 40:49.013
When the alternative is death, you do what you can.

41:04.995 --> 41:08.232
Okay, from now, we’d better go forward on foot.

41:08.299 --> 41:11.235
We don’t want to let them know we’re coming.

41:11.302 --> 41:12.903
Akula, lead the way.

41:18.609 --> 41:22.947
It’s clear. This way... stay close.

41:31.188 --> 41:32.823
Hey, I’ve been meaning to ask you about

41:32.890 --> 41:35.459
the booby trap you set when we met.

41:35.526 --> 41:37.027
What about it?

41:37.094 --> 41:39.363
I couldn’t help but notice that the hybrid shark,

41:39.430 --> 41:42.166
when it was on its back, it stopped moving.

41:42.232 --> 41:43.834
Why is that?

41:43.901 --> 41:45.469
Tonic immobility...

41:45.536 --> 41:47.271
when a shark is upside-down,

41:47.338 --> 41:48.572
it cannot move,

41:48.639 --> 41:52.776
and it’s about the only thing what can stop them.

41:54.111 --> 41:59.617
And how many sharks are out there, dozens, hundreds?

41:59.683 --> 42:01.685
A few dozen.

42:01.752 --> 42:03.387
Their leader, Tzarina Selah,

42:03.454 --> 42:05.956
only allows the very strongest to hatch.

42:06.023 --> 42:11.996
But even with her rules, automatic parthenogenesis

42:12.062 --> 42:16.367
asexual reproduction, started to happen.

42:16.433 --> 42:17.935
Nature finds a way.

42:29.413 --> 42:32.116
And how do they just pick a few to survive?

42:32.182 --> 42:34.585
Do they just let the weak ones die?

42:34.652 --> 42:36.954
All the eggs are cryogenically frozen in the hopes

42:37.021 --> 42:38.956
that they one day will have enough resources

42:39.023 --> 42:40.691
to hatch them all.

42:40.758 --> 42:41.892
The ones that are allowed to be born,

42:41.959 --> 42:43.627
the best and the strongest,

42:43.694 --> 42:46.096
are trying to protect the crater.

42:46.163 --> 42:47.431
No wonder you weren’t chosen.

42:49.500 --> 42:51.468
Everyone makes mistakes.

42:51.535 --> 42:52.936
Now, quiet.

42:53.003 --> 42:54.872
They can hear us.

43:21.432 --> 43:25.536
Wow... they built a whole civilization.

43:25.602 --> 43:30.708
Impressive, if they weren’t so terrifying.

43:30.774 --> 43:32.076
Who would have thought sharks

43:32.142 --> 43:34.311
would have colonized the moon before humans?

43:34.378 --> 43:36.346
Half-shark, half-human.

43:36.413 --> 43:37.381
All teeth?

43:37.448 --> 43:38.615
All violence... don’t forget that.

43:38.682 --> 43:40.150
Enough.

43:40.217 --> 43:43.387
Akula, where do we need to go to get into the prison?

43:43.454 --> 43:45.856
The other side of that large building.

43:45.923 --> 43:47.891
They don’t have heavy patrols there,

43:47.958 --> 43:49.526
they guard the front entrance.

43:49.593 --> 43:52.896
If we go in through the back, we should have a clear shot.

43:53.831 --> 43:55.632
You heard her.

43:55.699 --> 43:57.034
Let’s dance.

44:35.372 --> 44:36.807
[growls]

44:56.627 --> 44:59.463
Follow me, and don’t get any blood on you.

45:08.639 --> 45:10.040
Look what they were able to accomplish

45:10.107 --> 45:12.109
in only a few decades.

45:12.176 --> 45:13.510
Yeah, it’s impressive, all right.

45:13.577 --> 45:15.212
Too bad they’re all bloodthirsty killers

45:15.279 --> 45:16.980
who would rip your throat out if given the chance.

45:17.047 --> 45:20.651
Of course, just makes me wish we had the chance

45:20.717 --> 45:23.253
to actually do the mission we came here to do.

45:23.320 --> 45:27.257
Well, if they could, we sure can.

45:27.324 --> 45:30.160
These shark hybrids have only expansion

45:30.227 --> 45:32.029
and aggressions in mind.

45:32.095 --> 45:34.264
They never leave their guards down...

45:34.331 --> 45:36.200
stay alert.

45:57.154 --> 45:58.822
I don’t like this.

45:58.889 --> 46:01.291
Something feels wrong.

46:01.358 --> 46:02.559
We have to try.

46:02.626 --> 46:05.028
These footprints are the only signs of them.

46:06.196 --> 46:08.498
Nicole would do the same for us.

46:08.565 --> 46:11.001
I guess.

46:11.068 --> 46:14.972
It’s just spooky out here, on the far side.

46:18.242 --> 46:19.676
What’s that?

46:19.743 --> 46:20.944
What?

46:21.011 --> 46:22.145
I don’t know, it looks...

46:22.212 --> 46:24.481
it looks like a piece of fabric,

46:24.548 --> 46:26.950
maybe from one of the spacesuits.

46:38.629 --> 46:39.930
Oh, my God...

46:41.365 --> 46:42.466
Liam.

46:43.967 --> 46:47.604
And where’s Nicole, Michael, Henri?

46:47.671 --> 46:51.174
Come in, Commander, Michael, Henri, anybody...

46:51.241 --> 46:52.609
we have a casualty!

46:57.981 --> 47:00.250
Back to the ship... now!

47:02.886 --> 47:04.087
What do you think got Liam?

47:04.154 --> 47:06.023
There’s nothing living on the moon!

47:07.124 --> 47:08.625
Owen, you cut out for a second...

47:09.693 --> 47:11.628
Owen?

47:11.695 --> 47:13.430
Owen!

47:14.665 --> 47:16.366
Owen!

47:25.509 --> 47:27.044
Help!

47:50.767 --> 47:53.737
[groaning]

47:53.804 --> 47:55.305
[screaming]

48:02.179 --> 48:05.415
All right, if I take our location

48:05.482 --> 48:09.853
in conjunction with the moon’s rotation...

48:09.920 --> 48:12.255
there, we have our way home.

48:13.390 --> 48:14.858
But...

48:14.925 --> 48:17.494
But? But what?

48:17.561 --> 48:19.429
We have to get this bucket of bolts off the ground

48:19.496 --> 48:21.698
and headed back to Earth in less than six hours.

48:21.765 --> 48:26.470
If we don’t, it’s another four weeks till the next window.

48:26.536 --> 48:28.839
See if you can get in touch with Nicole.

48:28.905 --> 48:30.040
Maybe she’s with Ellie by now.

48:32.042 --> 48:33.944
Commander Tress, this is Tom.

48:34.011 --> 48:35.379
Come in, Commander.

48:35.445 --> 48:37.247
You and the crew need to get back to the ship ASAP.

48:37.314 --> 48:40.917
We only have a six-hour window to get home.

48:40.984 --> 48:43.353
Commander Tress, come in.

48:44.788 --> 48:46.723
Nicole?

48:46.790 --> 48:47.991
Ellie?

48:48.058 --> 48:50.127
Is anybody out there?

48:57.167 --> 48:59.636
If we get attacked, remember one rule...

48:59.703 --> 49:03.340
if we draw blood, we draw attention.

49:03.407 --> 49:06.276
But we’ve been cutting sharks all day.

49:06.343 --> 49:09.046
Exactly... out there, where there is no atmosphere.

49:09.112 --> 49:10.947
But here, they can smell anything.

49:11.014 --> 49:13.383
And boy, they do love smell of blood.

49:22.292 --> 49:24.394
God, it’s hot in here.

49:24.461 --> 49:25.796
It’s safe to take it off.

49:28.765 --> 49:33.236
They hold prisoners at the back end of this building.

49:33.303 --> 49:35.539
We have to be careful not to alert any patrols.

49:40.510 --> 49:42.412
Should we take ’em down?

49:42.479 --> 49:44.448
We have to avoid any conflicts.

49:44.514 --> 49:46.716
We’re on hybrids territory now.

49:54.357 --> 49:57.327
Looks like the hallway splits up ahead.

49:57.394 --> 50:00.297
We’ll take the left, you guys go right.

50:09.306 --> 50:11.274
Move out.

50:21.818 --> 50:23.954
The sooner we can get Henri back to our ship,

50:24.020 --> 50:26.590
the sooner we can get out of here for good.

50:31.061 --> 50:32.129
What do I do?

50:32.195 --> 50:35.098
We only have one shot at this.

50:35.165 --> 50:36.399
Follow my lead and take the low road.

50:36.466 --> 50:39.236
-What? -Trust me!

50:40.103 --> 50:41.571
Swing!

50:41.638 --> 50:42.873
Lunge!

50:49.012 --> 50:50.280
Stop!

50:50.347 --> 50:52.349
We wanna keep him alive?

50:52.415 --> 50:54.384
We draw blood, we draw attention, remember?

51:00.257 --> 51:01.391
[speaking Russian]

51:11.501 --> 51:13.303
He drew blood to alert the guards.

51:13.370 --> 51:15.172
I knew we should have killed him.

51:15.238 --> 51:16.706
We have to get out of here, go.

51:16.773 --> 51:19.709
-Go, go, go! -Go, go, go!

51:22.512 --> 51:23.713
Can’t risk it.

51:27.751 --> 51:28.718
We found Henri!

51:33.990 --> 51:35.825
Henri, oh, my God.

51:35.892 --> 51:37.027
I’m sorry, I...

51:37.093 --> 51:38.628
I tried my best, but I just...

51:40.931 --> 51:42.966
The ship, it’s not safe.

51:44.267 --> 51:45.936
What are you talking about?

51:46.002 --> 51:49.973
The sharks, they’re gonna use the ship to get back to Earth.

51:50.040 --> 51:52.976
They have an army of eggs that they’re gonna hatch there.

51:55.612 --> 51:57.480
Earth has all the resources they need

51:57.547 --> 51:59.549
to become the dominant species.

51:59.616 --> 52:00.750
Why wouldn’t they just use your ship?

52:00.817 --> 52:03.653
Well, my ship is barely big enough

52:03.720 --> 52:05.455
just for Akula and myself.

52:05.522 --> 52:07.157
We don’t have enough fuel to reach Earth,

52:07.224 --> 52:10.794
and we operate off the Cold War time technology.

52:10.860 --> 52:13.597
So, there is no way to plot a course.

52:13.663 --> 52:15.932
What about your ship?

52:15.999 --> 52:19.369
We have to get back, now.

52:19.436 --> 52:21.605
Michael, help Henri up.

52:21.671 --> 52:23.406
Let’s get outta here.

52:24.274 --> 52:25.875
[grunting]

52:29.279 --> 52:30.614
Come on, this way.

52:35.852 --> 52:36.786
Hurry!

52:48.965 --> 52:51.968
Quick! In here. They’re running the other way.

52:59.175 --> 53:01.611
What are these?

53:07.150 --> 53:08.752
Uh, guys?

53:10.086 --> 53:11.921
These are hybrid shark eggs.

53:11.988 --> 53:14.524
This must be their incubation chamber.

53:14.591 --> 53:16.526
There are so many.

53:16.593 --> 53:19.029
Earth would never stand a chance.

53:19.095 --> 53:21.298
We should destroy them now.

53:21.364 --> 53:22.999
No!

53:23.066 --> 53:24.534
Those are innocent children.

53:24.601 --> 53:26.303
They haven’t done anything wrong.

53:26.369 --> 53:27.604
Children?

53:27.671 --> 53:31.174
Those are monsters, killing machines.

53:31.241 --> 53:34.277
From what I heard about humans, they’re not better.

53:34.344 --> 53:37.480
Should we kill all the humans, too?

53:37.547 --> 53:38.915
If we stop them now,

53:38.982 --> 53:41.084
we can prevent an invasion from ever happening.

53:41.151 --> 53:44.454
Those things have millions of soldiers stockpiled,

53:44.521 --> 53:45.989
ready to attack at any minute.

53:46.056 --> 53:47.857
If we destroy them now,

53:47.924 --> 53:51.961
it’ll take them decades to recover, if they ever do.

54:03.373 --> 54:04.808
They’re sounding an alarm!

54:04.874 --> 54:06.476
We’ve lingered here too long.

54:06.543 --> 54:08.078
We have to get out of here, now!

54:08.144 --> 54:09.579
Go, hurry!

54:16.086 --> 54:20.423
Move slowly and quietly. The sharks know we’re here now.

54:28.498 --> 54:32.902
Magnificent. Just like you and me... sister.

54:33.970 --> 54:35.171
No...

54:35.238 --> 54:37.440
don’t group me in with your kind, Selah.

54:37.507 --> 54:39.142
From the moment I was born,

54:39.209 --> 54:41.778
it was made very clear to me that I’m not one of you.

54:49.319 --> 54:50.854
Where is Akula?

54:52.522 --> 54:54.057
Akula?

54:54.124 --> 54:55.125
Akula!

54:56.760 --> 55:00.029
They abandoned me, and you did nothing.

55:00.096 --> 55:01.865
I spared your life!

55:01.931 --> 55:05.402
They wanted to kill you, but I wouldn’t let them.

55:05.468 --> 55:07.837
I knew the human would take you in.

55:07.904 --> 55:10.306
Weak, predictable humans.

55:10.373 --> 55:12.041
My human has shown me more kindness

55:12.108 --> 55:15.044
from the very beginning than any hybrid ever has.

55:15.111 --> 55:16.613
Think, Akula.

55:16.679 --> 55:18.715
You are the link between human and shark.

55:18.782 --> 55:21.050
I knew it then and I know it now.

55:21.117 --> 55:23.086
We need you.

55:23.153 --> 55:26.589
That changes nothing.

55:26.656 --> 55:28.525
I know all about your plans.

55:28.591 --> 55:32.862
We are returning home. To where we belong.

55:32.929 --> 55:34.998
Not if you’re going to kill off humanity.

55:35.064 --> 55:36.900
I won’t let you.

55:37.967 --> 55:40.403
You can watch from here or you...

55:40.470 --> 55:42.839
we could finally go home.

55:51.481 --> 55:54.083
[speaking Russian]

55:59.389 --> 56:01.524
Don’t scare me like that again!

56:01.591 --> 56:03.026
Where have you been?

56:03.092 --> 56:05.695
I heard something.

56:05.762 --> 56:07.063
Could we steal one of the sharks’ rovers

56:07.130 --> 56:07.897
outside the building?

56:07.964 --> 56:10.033
Yes, we have to get out of here.

56:10.099 --> 56:11.734
Perfect. Henri?

56:11.801 --> 56:13.002
All good, Commander.

56:19.108 --> 56:20.777
We don’t have time for this.

56:22.345 --> 56:25.348
Michael!

56:25.415 --> 56:26.883
It’s either us or them.

56:30.453 --> 56:32.121
Get out! Get out!

56:39.329 --> 56:40.997
Commander...

56:41.064 --> 56:42.599
Commander Tress, can you hear me?

56:42.665 --> 56:44.167
It’s no use, Tom.

56:44.234 --> 56:46.970
We need to keep working until someone gets back.

56:47.036 --> 56:49.672
I hate feeling so helpless.

56:49.739 --> 56:52.442
Me too, but we have our plants,

56:52.509 --> 56:55.845
Liam’s experiments, and our back-up oxygen reserves.

56:55.912 --> 56:58.548
We could survive for months if we need to.

56:58.615 --> 57:03.219
Yeah, you’re right.

57:03.286 --> 57:04.787
Well, let’s just...

57:04.854 --> 57:06.155
-[clanging] -Oh!

57:06.222 --> 57:07.156
What was that?

57:10.326 --> 57:12.295
-The habitation chamber, hurry! -Go, go, go.

57:21.804 --> 57:24.107
Those look like shark teeth.

57:24.173 --> 57:25.942
Sharks on the moon... that’s what that was, yeah?

57:26.009 --> 57:27.677
Whatever it is, we cannot let it destroy

57:27.744 --> 57:30.780
the life support systems, we’ll never make it back if they do.

57:34.884 --> 57:36.920
-Ah! -Josie!

57:46.596 --> 57:49.399
Which way to the rovers?

57:49.465 --> 57:52.001
Those were children... babies.

57:52.068 --> 57:54.470
I did what I had to to survive.

57:54.537 --> 57:55.872
I saved our asses.

57:55.939 --> 57:57.740
And it’s not like I killed all of them,

57:57.807 --> 57:58.975
just a drop in the bucket.

57:59.042 --> 58:02.378
Enough! We have to move.

58:02.445 --> 58:04.247
They’ll be on us any second.

58:06.416 --> 58:09.886
We have to stick together or die alone, got it?

58:11.688 --> 58:14.090
Akula, lead the way.

58:26.336 --> 58:27.637
Get in.

58:40.917 --> 58:42.385
We gotta lose him.

58:42.452 --> 58:43.786
Hold on!

58:51.394 --> 58:53.563
Uh, he’s still there.

58:53.630 --> 58:55.565
Take him out.

58:55.632 --> 58:56.933
My pleasure.

59:02.805 --> 59:05.041
Nice shot.

59:05.108 --> 59:08.044
It will be back... that wasn’t a kill shot.

59:08.111 --> 59:10.480
But you bought us precious time.

59:10.546 --> 59:13.383
All we need, just keep moving.

59:13.449 --> 59:15.518
That’s an infrared communication device,

59:15.585 --> 59:16.653
same we’ve got in our suits.

59:16.719 --> 59:19.155
Ellie? Tom?

59:19.222 --> 59:21.424
Josie? Owen? Can anybody hear me?

59:21.491 --> 59:24.861
This is Commander Nicole Tress.

59:24.927 --> 59:26.229
If anyone can hear me,

59:26.295 --> 59:27.797
we got aggressive company coming in hot.

59:27.864 --> 59:29.432
Do what you can to arm the ship.

59:29.499 --> 59:30.767
You must keep it safe.

59:30.833 --> 59:33.670
I repeat, protect the ship at all costs.

59:33.736 --> 59:35.104
All right, everyone, keep an eye out...

59:35.171 --> 59:37.440
we don’t want any more surprises, got it?

59:47.984 --> 59:49.452
Everyone inside, hurry.

59:54.757 --> 59:56.793
We’re too late.

59:56.859 --> 59:58.561
Come on, we gotta help them.

59:58.628 --> 59:59.696
How many were inside?

59:59.762 --> 1:00:01.097
Four.

1:00:17.013 --> 1:00:18.281
Where is everyone?

1:00:18.347 --> 1:00:20.917
No bodies and no blood.

1:00:20.983 --> 1:00:22.385
We need to go room to room

1:00:22.452 --> 1:00:25.855
and see if we can find any of your people.

1:00:27.523 --> 1:00:29.258
Akula, stay by me.

1:00:44.874 --> 1:00:46.442
What happened here?

1:00:46.509 --> 1:00:47.777
[gasping]

1:00:47.844 --> 1:00:49.212
Oh! Nicole!

1:00:49.278 --> 1:00:51.914
-You’re back! -Josie! Tom!

1:00:51.981 --> 1:00:52.949
Where’s everyone else?

1:00:53.015 --> 1:00:54.617
They’re not with you?

1:00:54.684 --> 1:00:58.054
They went looking for you hours ago, and we’ve had no word.

1:01:00.723 --> 1:01:01.858
Liam as well.

1:01:05.661 --> 1:01:07.697
We think there’s some sharks still out there,

1:01:07.764 --> 1:01:09.332
just not sure where.

1:01:09.398 --> 1:01:10.533
They are sharks, right?

1:01:10.600 --> 1:01:13.002
Yes, and that’s why we need to make sure

1:01:13.069 --> 1:01:14.704
we have everything armed against them.

1:01:14.771 --> 1:01:15.872
Hold on, wait...

1:01:15.938 --> 1:01:16.873
who are they?

1:01:16.939 --> 1:01:18.941
What are you wearing,

1:01:19.008 --> 1:01:20.510
And why doesn’t she have oxygen?

1:01:23.146 --> 1:01:24.380
We’ll explain everything later.

1:01:24.447 --> 1:01:26.015
That’s Sergei, that’s Akula,

1:01:26.082 --> 1:01:27.450
and the only thing you need to know right now

1:01:27.517 --> 1:01:29.752
is we need to get back to Earth now,

1:01:29.819 --> 1:01:31.287
with these two as part of the crew.

1:01:31.354 --> 1:01:33.556
Good, I plotted us a course home,

1:01:33.623 --> 1:01:36.058
but we only have four hours and 15 minute window.

1:01:36.125 --> 1:01:38.060
If we repair breaches in the hull,

1:01:38.127 --> 1:01:41.230
we can use some of our spare oxygen tanks as...

1:01:41.297 --> 1:01:43.800
well, as the algae-based biofuel I’ve been working on

1:01:43.866 --> 1:01:45.601
to jump-start the ship.

1:01:45.668 --> 1:01:48.971
Great, the sooner we get off this rock, the better.

1:01:49.038 --> 1:01:50.973
Henri, do you think you can help Tom?

1:01:52.208 --> 1:01:54.644
Oh, my God, Henri, what happened?

1:01:54.710 --> 1:01:56.579
That’s how they were able to find the ship.

1:01:56.646 --> 1:01:58.681
They tortured me.

1:01:58.748 --> 1:02:00.483
What? You did what?

1:02:00.550 --> 1:02:01.651
Stop!

1:02:01.717 --> 1:02:03.386
Josie, you tell Sergei what else you need.

1:02:03.452 --> 1:02:05.588
Akula, you come with us to the command module

1:02:05.655 --> 1:02:07.890
to help Tom and Henri.

1:02:07.957 --> 1:02:09.458
First, we need to repair the entrance.

1:02:09.525 --> 1:02:13.329
And I will not let Akula to be out of my sight again.

1:02:13.396 --> 1:02:15.531
If Nicole needs my help to get off the moon,

1:02:15.598 --> 1:02:17.300
then you need to let me come with her.

1:02:19.035 --> 1:02:20.436
[clanging]

1:02:25.508 --> 1:02:27.143
They’re back!

1:02:31.981 --> 1:02:33.683
How many are there?

1:02:33.749 --> 1:02:36.252
Ten, 20... a lot.

1:02:36.319 --> 1:02:37.720
There are too many of them.

1:02:37.787 --> 1:02:39.622
And this... just a stupid baby.

1:02:39.689 --> 1:02:43.926
There is no way we can kill them fast enough with our harpoons.

1:02:43.993 --> 1:02:45.261
We need a new plan.

1:02:50.933 --> 1:02:52.168
I’ve got this.

1:02:52.235 --> 1:02:54.103
-Henri, no! -That’s too dangerous!

1:02:54.170 --> 1:02:55.905
You have plenty of capable people here

1:02:55.972 --> 1:02:57.139
that can repair the ship.

1:02:57.206 --> 1:02:59.008
Josie and Tom figured out a way home,

1:02:59.075 --> 1:03:01.544
Akula and Sergei have been stuck here for 40 years,

1:03:01.611 --> 1:03:03.813
and all I did was give up the location.

1:03:03.880 --> 1:03:05.014
Now I’m gonna fix it.

1:03:05.081 --> 1:03:06.549
What is he doing?

1:03:06.616 --> 1:03:09.619
Saving your asses... and no one’s gonna stop me.

1:03:09.685 --> 1:03:11.520
-My mind’s already made up. -Wait...

1:03:11.587 --> 1:03:13.422
I’m the commander, I should be doing this

1:03:13.489 --> 1:03:16.559
That’s exactly what you need to do, Commander... command.

1:03:16.626 --> 1:03:18.160
No, let him go.

1:03:18.227 --> 1:03:20.196
He’s the reason why we’re in this mess.

1:03:21.564 --> 1:03:24.400
You can barely stand on one foot.

1:03:24.467 --> 1:03:26.869
The sharks were gonna find us no matter what.

1:03:26.936 --> 1:03:28.604
No, they’re right.

1:03:30.006 --> 1:03:31.140
I’ll draw them away from the ship

1:03:31.207 --> 1:03:33.142
and then I’ll take care of them.

1:03:33.209 --> 1:03:35.044
Hopefully, I’ll be able to give them the slip,

1:03:35.111 --> 1:03:37.446
and then together, we can get home.

1:03:45.788 --> 1:03:47.823
If we return, I will make sure you receive

1:03:47.890 --> 1:03:50.393
the highest possible commendations.

1:03:50.459 --> 1:03:52.595
When we get home, Commander.

1:04:12.181 --> 1:04:14.450
All right, everyone, take cover.

1:04:36.839 --> 1:04:39.141
Ah!

1:04:48.851 --> 1:04:51.187
Die, you son of a bitch!

1:05:03.899 --> 1:05:05.201
All clear.

1:05:05.267 --> 1:05:06.736
Henri’s sacrifice won’t be forgotten.

1:05:09.138 --> 1:05:10.406
All right, team, we have work to do.

1:05:10.473 --> 1:05:11.574
Tom?

1:05:13.409 --> 1:05:15.144
Yeah.

1:05:15.211 --> 1:05:17.480
Seal off this section, plot us a course home.

1:05:19.415 --> 1:05:21.717
I’ll take care of the breach.

1:05:21.784 --> 1:05:22.718
Akula.

1:05:25.154 --> 1:05:27.156
Roger that, Commander.

1:05:27.223 --> 1:05:28.524
Follow me.

1:05:45.241 --> 1:05:47.109
Adjusting for our new weight,

1:05:47.176 --> 1:05:50.780
using the moon’s gravitational pull to our advantage,

1:05:50.846 --> 1:05:52.314
I think we can pull this off.

1:05:53.983 --> 1:05:57.753
Our flight path is clear, but...

1:05:57.820 --> 1:05:59.188
But what?

1:05:59.255 --> 1:06:01.090
We have less time than I thought.

1:06:01.157 --> 1:06:03.025
How much time we talking?

1:06:03.092 --> 1:06:04.527
Twenty-four minutes and 37 seconds.

1:06:04.593 --> 1:06:05.995
You said we had four hours!

1:06:06.062 --> 1:06:08.631
I forgot to adjust the amount of force required

1:06:08.697 --> 1:06:10.366
to get us to the speed to successfully

1:06:10.433 --> 1:06:11.801
fling us to the near side.

1:06:11.867 --> 1:06:13.669
Our initial launch didn’t account for us

1:06:13.736 --> 1:06:15.704
being on the far side.

1:06:21.377 --> 1:06:23.646
I just fixed the hull breach.

1:06:23.712 --> 1:06:26.849
Let’s everyone be ready so we can hit that window.

1:06:28.084 --> 1:06:29.385
Let’s move.

1:06:29.452 --> 1:06:30.786
More sharks will be showing up any second.

1:06:34.857 --> 1:06:36.125
Oh, no.

1:06:36.192 --> 1:06:39.061
What? What is it?

1:06:39.128 --> 1:06:40.463
They’re here.

1:06:47.203 --> 1:06:50.139
They’re loading up the eggs!

1:06:52.508 --> 1:06:54.176
They’re boarding the ship.

1:06:58.080 --> 1:06:59.615
Who is that?

1:07:03.018 --> 1:07:06.155
That’s Tzarina Selah. She’s their leader.

1:07:09.925 --> 1:07:12.595
[Selah] Search the ship! Kill all who remain.

1:07:12.661 --> 1:07:14.196
We still need to seal the interior hull

1:07:14.263 --> 1:07:15.531
before we can take off.

1:07:15.598 --> 1:07:16.966
You’re not wearing protective suits.

1:07:17.032 --> 1:07:19.802
They can detect your electromagnetic signature.

1:07:19.869 --> 1:07:23.439
Stay near electronics... they’ll go after you first.

1:07:23.506 --> 1:07:25.574
I need to download the flight plan onto my drive.

1:07:25.641 --> 1:07:27.510
We can’t let them have it.

1:07:27.576 --> 1:07:29.545
We have to hold on to that.

1:07:29.612 --> 1:07:30.946
[banging]

1:07:31.013 --> 1:07:33.649
We can’t risk it, we need everyone alive.

1:07:33.716 --> 1:07:36.585
Find a place to hide, and attack only when necessary.

1:07:42.791 --> 1:07:44.360
Everyone hide, now!

1:08:56.365 --> 1:08:59.268
Ah!

1:09:03.372 --> 1:09:05.708
Come on, come on...

1:09:05.774 --> 1:09:07.409
Got it!

1:09:09.778 --> 1:09:11.714
Oh, shit.

1:09:18.254 --> 1:09:19.888
Tom...

1:09:22.124 --> 1:09:24.760
Ah!

1:09:24.827 --> 1:09:26.829
You’re a freak of nature, you know that?

1:09:31.900 --> 1:09:33.936
Do your worst.

1:09:38.674 --> 1:09:40.009
Stop!

1:09:43.946 --> 1:09:45.514
We surrender.

1:10:21.517 --> 1:10:23.552
Akula, sister.

1:10:23.619 --> 1:10:25.888
You should have taken me up on my offer.

1:10:25.954 --> 1:10:29.258
After all, none of this could have happened without your help.

1:10:29.325 --> 1:10:30.793
What offer? What help?

1:10:30.859 --> 1:10:32.761
How do you think we learned how to fly a ship?

1:10:32.828 --> 1:10:34.396
When you were out hunting us,

1:10:34.463 --> 1:10:37.099
we sent some hybrids to break into your ship

1:10:37.166 --> 1:10:38.634
and learn everything they could.

1:10:38.701 --> 1:10:40.336
I didn’t know, Papa.

1:10:40.402 --> 1:10:42.438
I had no idea.

1:10:42.504 --> 1:10:44.106
Don’t be modest.

1:10:44.173 --> 1:10:47.042
Now you have a chance to live among your real family

1:10:47.109 --> 1:10:51.146
and be a leader of our people on Earth.

1:10:51.213 --> 1:10:52.481
Is it true?

1:10:53.649 --> 1:10:55.017
She offered it, yes,

1:10:55.084 --> 1:10:58.487
but I never considered it, not for a moment.

1:10:58.554 --> 1:11:01.724
Sharks are not my family.

1:11:01.790 --> 1:11:04.326
They left me for dead.

1:11:04.393 --> 1:11:05.928
You are my family.

1:11:05.994 --> 1:11:09.531
Exactly why we abandoned you near his ship to begin with.

1:11:09.598 --> 1:11:13.702
Our plan was executed perfectly. All thanks to you.

1:11:13.769 --> 1:11:16.105
I swear, I didn’t know, Papa.

1:11:16.171 --> 1:11:17.106
You believe me, right?

1:11:18.540 --> 1:11:20.109
I trust you.

1:11:21.510 --> 1:11:23.045
She’s my daughter.

1:11:24.613 --> 1:11:26.448
I trust her with my life.

1:11:28.917 --> 1:11:33.088
Selah, it’s not too late.

1:11:34.923 --> 1:11:39.194
You could continue your good work here.

1:11:39.261 --> 1:11:42.164
We can go back to Earth and return with supplies.

1:11:42.231 --> 1:11:45.567
You could grow and thrive.

1:11:45.634 --> 1:11:47.936
Just let us go.

1:11:49.204 --> 1:11:50.839
Humans made you...

1:11:50.906 --> 1:11:52.441
we can help you.

1:11:52.508 --> 1:11:54.710
I’d rather take Earth for my own.

1:11:54.777 --> 1:11:57.546
We’re leaving... now.

1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:20.502
We need to get off this ship.

1:12:22.905 --> 1:12:24.873
Guards don’t speak English.

1:12:26.175 --> 1:12:27.876
I don’t think we can trust her anymore.

1:12:27.943 --> 1:12:29.678
What more does she have to do?

1:12:29.745 --> 1:12:32.014
She’s saved your ass more times today than I can count.

1:12:32.080 --> 1:12:34.950
She’s proven herself to be worth not only our trust,

1:12:35.017 --> 1:12:36.018
but our respect.

1:12:38.287 --> 1:12:39.254
I believe you.

1:12:39.321 --> 1:12:40.289
Thank you.

1:12:40.355 --> 1:12:41.490
I believe you, too.

1:12:46.228 --> 1:12:52.067
I suppose if you’re in here with us, you’re one of us.

1:12:52.134 --> 1:12:54.036
So, we’re good?

1:12:54.102 --> 1:12:55.237
Sure.

1:12:56.939 --> 1:12:59.975
Okay, maybe there’s a way out of here.

1:13:00.042 --> 1:13:02.177
If we can get out, maybe there’s something on your ship.

1:13:02.244 --> 1:13:03.812
No, there’s...

1:13:08.050 --> 1:13:09.885
Oh, my God, they’re gonna torture us.

1:13:09.952 --> 1:13:11.820
Not without a fight, they aren’t.

1:13:19.228 --> 1:13:20.829
Gotcha.

1:13:20.896 --> 1:13:23.365
[All] Henri!

1:13:23.432 --> 1:13:26.268
Henri!

1:13:28.303 --> 1:13:29.838
Ah!

1:13:40.249 --> 1:13:41.316
Tom’s USB.

1:13:50.125 --> 1:13:52.227
The flight plans!

1:13:52.294 --> 1:13:53.595
If we can get this back to your ship, Sergei,

1:13:53.662 --> 1:13:55.197
we can use this to get back

1:13:55.264 --> 1:13:56.965
and warn Earth that the sharks aren’t to be trusted.

1:13:57.032 --> 1:13:59.134
We could fight!

1:14:05.274 --> 1:14:06.675
There!

1:14:09.678 --> 1:14:11.313
Depressurizing.

1:14:16.184 --> 1:14:18.587
They’ll be here any second, hurry!

1:14:18.654 --> 1:14:20.489
It looks to be about 50 feet down.

1:14:20.556 --> 1:14:21.957
It’s only gonna get further,

1:14:22.024 --> 1:14:24.293
and gravity’s gonna slow you down, now, go!

1:14:24.359 --> 1:14:26.595
One at a time to be safe.

1:14:31.433 --> 1:14:32.768
Come on, hurry!

1:14:32.834 --> 1:14:35.237
I’ll go first, so I can catch you when you land.

1:14:35.304 --> 1:14:36.605
I’m not a kid anymore.

1:14:36.672 --> 1:14:39.274
I will not let you to be hurt.

1:14:39.341 --> 1:14:40.776
Wait for my command!

1:14:49.785 --> 1:14:52.721
Akula, jump!

1:14:52.788 --> 1:14:55.891
Warning, hatch breach in Module Four.

1:14:55.958 --> 1:14:59.861
Warning, hatch breach in Module Four.

1:14:59.928 --> 1:15:02.698
-You next. -No, you!

1:15:02.764 --> 1:15:04.866
Stop!

1:15:04.933 --> 1:15:07.202
-Change of plans. -Ah!

1:15:12.674 --> 1:15:14.409
[grunts]

1:15:14.476 --> 1:15:15.410
Where is Akula?

1:15:15.477 --> 1:15:16.445
Are you all right, boss?

1:15:16.511 --> 1:15:18.280
Yeah, I’m fine.

1:15:18.347 --> 1:15:20.549
[speaking Russian]

1:15:20.616 --> 1:15:22.618
I wish I could take credit.

1:15:22.684 --> 1:15:25.821
Scar...

1:15:25.887 --> 1:15:28.857
But it was a human that killed your precious bodyguard.

1:15:37.833 --> 1:15:38.900
It’s Akula...

1:15:38.967 --> 1:15:40.936
and something else.

1:15:43.705 --> 1:15:45.007
Akula.

1:15:46.541 --> 1:15:48.510
Is that the tzarina?

1:15:48.577 --> 1:15:50.112
It was.

1:15:50.178 --> 1:15:52.447
Pretty sure she got some brain damage, or worse.

1:15:52.514 --> 1:15:53.915
Guys...

1:16:00.789 --> 1:16:03.091
My ship is not far away... run!

1:16:12.834 --> 1:16:14.202
Over here!

1:16:14.269 --> 1:16:15.637
I’ve set up a perimeter of booby traps

1:16:15.704 --> 1:16:17.139
that will help slow them down.

1:16:32.254 --> 1:16:35.590
There is a way we can destroy the rest of the sharks,

1:16:35.657 --> 1:16:37.459
and maybe, if we are lucky,

1:16:37.526 --> 1:16:39.728
we can destroy their ship before it gets too far.

1:16:39.795 --> 1:16:40.996
Out with it!

1:16:41.063 --> 1:16:42.464
What? What is it?

1:16:42.531 --> 1:16:45.333
The nitrogen-enriched soil I use to grow crops

1:16:45.400 --> 1:16:47.669
can be used to make an explosion.

1:16:47.736 --> 1:16:51.239
I can’t believe that I didn’t think of this sooner.

1:16:52.741 --> 1:16:55.911
There is no bomb that you can make that will reach the sharks.

1:16:55.977 --> 1:16:57.579
Yes, but I can make the ones

1:16:57.646 --> 1:17:01.416
that would aggravate the magma under the moon’s surface.

1:17:01.483 --> 1:17:04.086
I can fly my rocket straight into the center.

1:17:04.152 --> 1:17:06.955
It’s the only way.

1:17:07.022 --> 1:17:10.425
But you’ll die!

1:17:12.694 --> 1:17:16.298
Anything will be wiped out on the surface within 50 miles.

1:17:16.364 --> 1:17:17.699
Including us.

1:17:17.766 --> 1:17:20.802
The geo-thermal disturbance will create tidal waves of lava

1:17:20.869 --> 1:17:24.206
that will spread easily over 50 miles.

1:17:26.808 --> 1:17:30.212
Looks like they’re flanking us, we have to move... run.

1:17:47.763 --> 1:17:51.767
That’s not going to hold long.

1:17:51.833 --> 1:17:53.101
She doesn’t have much,

1:17:53.168 --> 1:17:58.540
but controls still working, engine runs.

1:17:58.607 --> 1:18:01.376
And we just have enough fuel for one shot.

1:18:02.811 --> 1:18:06.181
I can do it all by myself, but I need you buy me some time.

1:18:06.248 --> 1:18:09.050
There has to be a better way.

1:18:09.117 --> 1:18:10.652
We don’t have time.

1:18:10.719 --> 1:18:12.287
They’re already here.

1:18:12.354 --> 1:18:13.922
Sergei, no!

1:18:13.989 --> 1:18:16.124
I’ll stay with you, I’ll...

1:18:16.191 --> 1:18:19.494
Akula, my sweet daughter,

1:18:19.561 --> 1:18:21.229
my dearest daughter,

1:18:21.296 --> 1:18:23.932
I’m finally ready to do something by myself.

1:18:23.999 --> 1:18:27.335
I need you to go with Nicole and Michael,

1:18:27.402 --> 1:18:32.707
and keep the hybrids off my back so we can destroy them.

1:18:32.774 --> 1:18:35.977
You are the best fighter I know.

1:18:36.044 --> 1:18:37.846
You can do it.

1:18:37.913 --> 1:18:40.048
Spasiba, Papa.

1:18:44.820 --> 1:18:47.155
[speaks Russian]

1:18:51.726 --> 1:18:53.061
Keep it with you.

1:18:53.128 --> 1:18:55.664
I’ve always saved it for the long time,

1:18:55.730 --> 1:18:57.265
while we land in the sea.

1:18:57.332 --> 1:18:58.300
Keep it on you.

1:18:58.366 --> 1:19:00.402
When you land, it will do the job.

1:19:00.468 --> 1:19:03.438
Trust me... it will do the job.

1:19:09.277 --> 1:19:10.512
Now, go.

1:19:10.579 --> 1:19:13.415
Please keep them off my back so we can break theirs.

1:19:14.683 --> 1:19:16.117
Go!

1:19:23.658 --> 1:19:24.693
You ready?

1:19:24.759 --> 1:19:27.495
Ready?

1:19:27.562 --> 1:19:28.597
Who could be?

1:19:30.098 --> 1:19:31.466
Well, too bad.

1:19:41.576 --> 1:19:43.612
Ha!

1:19:43.678 --> 1:19:46.314
Ah!

1:19:46.381 --> 1:19:47.916
[grunting]

1:20:09.137 --> 1:20:10.705
[rock n roll music plays]

1:20:16.611 --> 1:20:18.647
Okay, old lady...

1:20:18.713 --> 1:20:20.181
show me what you’ve got.

1:20:23.685 --> 1:20:27.322
[grunting]

1:20:32.127 --> 1:20:33.795
-Thanks. -You’re welcome.

1:20:33.862 --> 1:20:35.864
Keep fighting, let’s go!

1:20:35.931 --> 1:20:37.232
Ha!

1:21:25.847 --> 1:21:28.550
Ah!

1:21:34.723 --> 1:21:38.093
[speaking Russian]

1:23:06.748 --> 1:23:07.882
[panting]

1:23:21.162 --> 1:23:22.964
What on Earth?

1:23:23.031 --> 1:23:24.999
Exactly!

1:23:25.066 --> 1:23:28.736
Earth!

1:23:28.803 --> 1:23:30.004
We’re here!

1:23:30.071 --> 1:23:32.740
I can’t believe we’re here!

1:23:32.807 --> 1:23:36.878
Papa was right... we’re home, thanks to Papa.

1:23:36.945 --> 1:23:39.747
We’ll make sure his sacrifice is not forgotten.

1:23:41.749 --> 1:23:44.319
Papa described Earth to me, and he was right.

1:23:44.385 --> 1:23:48.123
He said it would eclipse all of my wildest imagination.

1:23:48.189 --> 1:23:50.258
Oh, it’s beautiful, Papa!

1:23:50.325 --> 1:23:52.494
It really is.

1:23:52.560 --> 1:23:55.230
I’m never gonna take it for granted again.

1:23:56.865 --> 1:24:00.034
We need to figure out how to get back.

1:24:00.101 --> 1:24:04.973
Maybe wait till dark, plot a detailed course with the stars.

1:24:05.039 --> 1:24:07.208
Oh, it hurts...

1:24:07.275 --> 1:24:08.576
oh, it really, really hurts, ugh!

1:24:08.643 --> 1:24:10.445
Akula! Where does it hurt?

1:24:10.512 --> 1:24:12.180
It’s coming in waves!

1:24:12.247 --> 1:24:15.383
All right, just breathe, deep breaths.

1:24:15.450 --> 1:24:17.418
[heavy breathing]

1:24:19.587 --> 1:24:22.891
Akula, did you maybe have any sort of...

1:24:22.957 --> 1:24:25.627
relationship with any of the shark hybrids?

1:24:25.693 --> 1:24:27.829
What? No!

1:24:27.896 --> 1:24:29.364
Ah!

1:24:32.066 --> 1:24:33.768
Akula, I think you’re pregnant.

1:24:33.835 --> 1:24:34.969
What?

1:24:35.036 --> 1:24:36.304
How is it possible?

1:24:36.371 --> 1:24:38.640
Automatic parthenogenesis?

1:24:38.706 --> 1:24:41.342
Sergei mentioned it happening to the other sharks.

1:24:46.080 --> 1:24:47.515
Akula, push!

1:24:50.151 --> 1:24:52.420
[screams]

1:25:01.095 --> 1:25:05.567
It’s... it’s adorable!

1:25:05.633 --> 1:25:08.770
Oh, great... now we have another mouth to feed.

1:25:10.138 --> 1:25:11.306
Ah!

1:25:11.372 --> 1:25:13.608
Son of a bitch, these teeth are sharp!

1:25:13.675 --> 1:25:16.978
Nicole, I’ve got to take care of my babies!

1:25:18.046 --> 1:25:19.414
Akula!

1:25:23.985 --> 1:25:26.621
Akula! Akula!

1:25:30.858 --> 1:25:32.560
We’re so fu--
