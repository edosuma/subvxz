You're not gonna believe

00:20.388 --> 00:22.054
the crazy thing
I just saw out there.

00:22.056 --> 00:23.455
Maybe you're just a little
confused about what you saw.

00:23.457 --> 00:24.823
How much have you
had to drink today?

00:29.130 --> 00:30.562
Well, maybe I should
just go away for a while.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.865
All right?
It's a cold, Mike.

00:36.403 --> 00:38.303
"So long, Phil.

00:38.305 --> 00:40.806
Didn't want you to have
to say good-bye again."

00:46.312 --> 00:47.846
You sure about this, Tandy?

00:47.848 --> 00:49.815
Carol, I'm his brother.

00:49.817 --> 00:53.085
Fine, just please be safe.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.654
I want you to come home
so that Yorbalinda or Bezequiel

00:55.656 --> 00:56.922
can meet their daddy.

00:56.924 --> 00:59.658
Hey, hey, don't worry.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.660
I'll be back before you know it.

01:01.662 --> 01:04.329
Nothing in this world
is more important to me

01:04.331 --> 01:06.098

01:09.669 --> 01:12.171
Hey there, little guy or gal.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.238

01:13.240 --> 01:15.441
Your daddy's going
on a little trip

01:15.443 --> 01:17.176
to see your Uncle Mike.

01:17.178 --> 01:18.777
Heck, I just realized

01:18.779 --> 01:20.746
he probably doesn't even know
what an uncle is.

01:21.848 --> 01:23.515
That means he's my brother.

01:23.517 --> 01:27.019
We had the same
mother and father.

01:27.021 --> 01:28.854
Mothers and fathers
are the people

01:28.856 --> 01:31.957
who make little babies like you.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.258
Now, how do they do that?

01:34.360 --> 01:36.195
Simple-- when a man and a woman

01:36.197 --> 01:38.363
share a special connection,

01:38.365 --> 01:40.532
the man takes his penis and...
Ooh!

01:40.534 --> 01:41.533
Baby's asleep.

01:41.535 --> 01:44.036
It's go time.

01:44.038 --> 01:46.071
How do you know where he is?

01:46.073 --> 01:47.706
He didn't say
where he was going.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.141
Hey...

01:49.143 --> 01:51.977
there's only one place
he could have gone.

'Cause this, my friend,

05:05.673 --> 05:07.739

05:07.741 --> 05:10.075
So, you farted into a jar
and you saved it?

05:10.077 --> 05:12.844
Eh, this is not some
whimsical pursuit, Mike.

05:12.846 --> 05:15.347
This is a valid
scientific experiment

05:15.349 --> 05:16.915

at that.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.684

05:18.686 --> 05:20.585
its unique smell composition

05:20.587 --> 05:22.354
in a sealed jar?
Yeah, well,

05:22.356 --> 05:23.588
I hate to burst your bubble,

05:23.590 --> 05:25.090
but if that thing's been
in there for 30 years,

05:25.092 --> 05:26.191
it's long gone.

assure you that

05:37.204 --> 05:38.937

06:37.331 --> 06:38.663
I know.
Well, how...

06:38.665 --> 06:39.664
how do you know that
the fart you're smelling

06:39.666 --> 06:40.999
came from that jar

06:41.001 --> 06:43.335
and not, say,
an alternate source?

06:43.337 --> 06:47.539
What kind of frigging
alternate source would be...?

06:47.541 --> 06:50.509
Oh, you didn't.

06:50.511 --> 06:51.676
Mike, you didn't.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.179
I pooted a little bit.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.014
You son of a bitch!
You knew I wanted...

06:56.016 --> 06:58.016
Well, you should have told me
you were gonna open it up, I...

06:58.018 --> 07:00.218
I was very clear
about opening it, Mike!

07:00.220 --> 07:02.354
I made a big spectacle of it!

07:02.356 --> 07:04.856

08:00.848 --> 08:02.347

08:02.349 --> 08:04.783
Because whoever sent
this thing is trouble.

08:08.187 --> 08:09.287
You don't know that.

08:09.289 --> 08:10.755
They could have been nice.
Nice?

08:10.757 --> 08:12.924
No, a nice person says,
"Hey, guys, I'm alive,

08:12.926 --> 08:14.626
here's a pound cake."

08:14.628 --> 08:17.128
They don't plant a freakin'
camera at our front door,

08:17.130 --> 08:18.597

Phil, it's okay.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.985
It burns.
What do you--
wh-wh-where?

09:13.987 --> 09:15.487
It's burning.
I don't know.

09:15.489 --> 09:16.655

I don't know where.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.156

It burns.

09:40.714 --> 09:44.115
Okay, can we just stop
with the pranks, please?

09:44.117 --> 09:46.017
Nice try, Mike.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.953
(laughing)
No, I'm being serious, okay?

09:47.955 --> 09:50.522
I just don't feel like
joking around right now, okay.

09:50.524 --> 09:51.690
(coughs)
Fine.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.191
We do a rain check on the joking

09:53.193 --> 09:55.360

your full recovery.
See, this is

09:55.362 --> 09:56.728
exactly why I didn't
want you to come,

09:56.730 --> 09:58.029
'cause you can't handle.

09:58.031 --> 09:59.798
There's nothing to handle, Mike.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.299
Can you please just be honest?

10:01.301 --> 10:02.701
Honest about what?

10:02.703 --> 10:05.537
About everything!

10:05.539 --> 10:06.538
About anything.

10:06.540 --> 10:07.539
I...

10:07.541 --> 10:10.775
I'm not doing good here, man.

10:12.979 --> 10:14.312
(coughs)

10:14.314 --> 10:16.147
Everything's
a frigging joke to you.

10:17.717 --> 10:20.652
(whispering):
Okay.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.053
You want honesty?

10:22.055 --> 10:24.723
Yeah, I do.

10:26.058 --> 10:28.727
I don't like what
you did to my hair.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.261
(sarcastic):
No.

10:30.263 --> 10:33.264
I fr-- I friggin' hate it.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.733
I was not

10:34.735 --> 10:36.401
gonna give myself this haircut.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.737
I-I didn't want you
to get the victory, though,

10:38.739 --> 10:39.904
so I just said

10:39.906 --> 10:41.239
that I loved it, but...

10:41.241 --> 10:43.341
it was all an act, man.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.243
A freakin' act.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.912
You're real good at acting.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.748
I know.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.349
Well, if you don't like it,

10:51.351 --> 10:53.351
why don't we do
something about it?

...sorry, but reverse genie.

What is your problem?!

12:21.441 --> 12:23.842
Huh?!

12:23.844 --> 12:27.045
You are the most childish,
selfish person I have ever met!

12:27.047 --> 12:28.880
You made a mess

12:28.882 --> 12:31.683
of your whole life, and now
you're messing with my death!

12:31.685 --> 12:33.518
What do you mean,
I messed up my life?

12:33.520 --> 12:35.687
Sorry, that was wrong of me.

12:35.689 --> 12:37.122
You never had a life.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.057
You're just a loser temp.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.291
Never had a girlfriend.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.026
Lived in a crappy
studio apartment

12:42.028 --> 12:44.963
that Mom and Dad paid for.

12:44.965 --> 12:49.134
The only time you even came
close to actually being special

12:49.136 --> 12:52.637
was when everyone died but you.

12:55.207 --> 12:57.776
Well, looks like you
really have me pegged there.

(Mike coughing)

13:20.399 --> 13:22.133
I'm sorry.

13:23.402 --> 13:24.769
I only said that stuff

13:24.771 --> 13:26.171
'cause I was trying
to push you away.

13:26.173 --> 13:28.072
Come on, i-it's all true.

13:28.074 --> 13:29.340
I'm a freaking loser.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.341
No, you're not.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.509
Look at what you did.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.944
You...

13:32.946 --> 13:34.679
you brought all
those people together, you...

13:34.681 --> 13:35.914
with the signs, you know.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.615
Like, you restarted society.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.284
That's amazing.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.419
Maybe you should
have led with that.
Yeah.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.087
I went... I went too far, yeah.
Very rough, man.

13:43.089 --> 13:45.857
Let's go inside.

13:45.859 --> 13:47.692
(coughing)

13:49.261 --> 13:50.361
What is that?

13:52.431 --> 13:53.665
Um...

14:08.447 --> 14:10.615
You had to bury them.

14:12.718 --> 14:15.453
I'm so sorry.

14:15.455 --> 14:16.855
(sniffs)

14:22.628 --> 14:24.796
Wait, is that...?

14:35.741 --> 14:37.876
I thought you were gone.

14:39.311 --> 14:41.412
I didn't know what to do.

14:45.150 --> 14:46.517
(sniffs)

14:46.519 --> 14:48.586
You know what...

14:48.588 --> 14:49.821
you already had to do this once,

14:49.823 --> 14:51.489
you shouldn't have
to do it again.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.024
I think you got
to go back to Malibu.
No, I'm...

14:53.026 --> 14:54.659
I'm not going back.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.327
Okay, you're going back.
No, we've already

14:56.329 --> 14:57.595
gone through
this before.
I'm telling you.

14:57.597 --> 14:58.997
I'm not going back, okay?

14:58.999 --> 15:00.431
It's my dying wish.

15:02.001 --> 15:04.769
Okay?

15:04.771 --> 15:07.272
My dying wish.

15:12.177 --> 15:14.245

Oh, my God, Carol?

15:24.057 --> 15:25.290
(calf mooing)

15:25.292 --> 15:26.524
What the hell is going on?!

15:26.526 --> 15:28.026
I thought it was an intruder.

15:28.028 --> 15:29.694
Oh, my gosh, my water broke.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.529
Way too soon for that, hon.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.631
Oh, yeah, it's pee.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.967
Look, I'm sorry, but there's
a crazy person out there.

15:35.969 --> 15:38.036
I think there might be
a crazy person

15:38.038 --> 15:39.137
in here.

15:39.139 --> 15:41.039
I am not crazy, okay?!

15:41.041 --> 15:42.640
This world is not safe!

15:42.642 --> 15:44.208
Phil is dead.

15:44.210 --> 15:45.710
The cow is dead.

15:45.712 --> 15:48.379
Mike is dying,
and now there's this thing

15:48.381 --> 15:50.048
flying around, spying on us.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.049
It's just a little much.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.051
See?

15:53.053 --> 15:55.954
Even the calf wants out
of this stupid world.

15:57.389 --> 15:58.589
Melissa...

15:58.591 --> 15:59.991
give me your hand.

16:01.894 --> 16:03.394
Ugh, Carol, you're
five weeks pregnant.

16:03.396 --> 16:04.729
I'm not gonna
feel anything.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.397
Really?

16:06.399 --> 16:08.266
'Cause I think you are.

16:08.268 --> 16:10.234
There's a life in there.

16:10.236 --> 16:12.170
It's a life that's
never gonna know

16:12.172 --> 16:14.572
the pre-virus world
we lived in--

16:14.574 --> 16:16.341
only this world--

16:16.343 --> 16:18.743
and this world...

16:18.745 --> 16:21.279
can't suck.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.680
I won't stand for it.

16:25.017 --> 16:26.084
(crying):
I'm sorry.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.086
It's okay.

16:35.294 --> 16:36.861

16:46.372 --> 16:47.438
So...

16:47.440 --> 16:50.108
So...
So...

16:50.110 --> 16:52.844
I, uh, got something for you.

16:55.314 --> 16:56.814
(laughs)

16:56.816 --> 16:58.449
You didn't.

16:58.451 --> 17:01.619
Figure you could crack
that open in 30 years.

17:01.621 --> 17:04.022
Take a whiff, see what's what.

17:05.791 --> 17:07.792
We'll open it together.

17:07.794 --> 17:08.960
Yeah.

17:08.962 --> 17:11.396
Yeah.

17:26.178 --> 17:28.980
(coughs)

17:28.982 --> 17:31.049
(whispering):
Okay.

17:39.425 --> 17:40.591
Mike?

17:48.500 --> 17:50.902
Got something for you, too.

18:01.013 --> 18:03.448
These are my buddies.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.249
They got me through
some hard times.

18:11.190 --> 18:12.757
Thanks, Phil.

18:14.526 --> 18:16.594
(whispering):
All right.

18:23.735 --> 18:25.736
(car door closes)

18:25.738 --> 18:27.805
(engine starts)

18:57.002 --> 18:58.569
Hi.

18:58.571 --> 18:59.737
Hey.

18:59.739 --> 19:02.406
I like the new
hairdo and face-do.

19:16.355 --> 19:17.655
I love you.

19:18.624 --> 19:20.591
I love you, too.

19:22.594 --> 19:24.762
(calf moos)

19:26.131 --> 19:28.032
(Carol gasps)

19:28.034 --> 19:29.634
Will you look at that?

19:29.636 --> 19:31.869
I have been trying
to get him to eat

19:31.871 --> 19:33.271
for the past three days.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.106
He's suckled on everything
but this bottle.

19:35.108 --> 19:38.776
I mean, Melissa's shotgun,
spatulas, doorknobs.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.511
Gail had some sort of
vibrating massage finger.

19:40.513 --> 19:41.646
He was a big

19:41.648 --> 19:43.714
fan of that,
but I could never

19:43.716 --> 19:45.550
get him to
suckle on this,

19:45.552 --> 19:47.118
and then you
waltz in here like

19:47.120 --> 19:48.719
the second coming
of Old MacDonald

19:48.721 --> 19:51.122
and make it happen.

19:51.124 --> 19:52.490
(calf suckling)

19:52.492 --> 19:54.892
You're gonna be
a great father.

19:57.829 --> 20:00.131
That was really sweet, Carol.

20:00.133 --> 20:02.733
Oh, hey, thanks, Melissa.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.969
She tried to shoot me.

a baker's dozen wines,

20:28.995 --> 20:31.195
but I think I'm seeing
something kind of

20:31.197 --> 20:33.598
on the spectacular
side out here.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.667
Could I get a little
confirm-a-doodle-doo on this?

20:38.537 --> 20:41.239
ERICA:
Carol, Tandy,
come look at this.

20:42.174 --> 20:43.841

Hey, what's going on out there?

20:45.845 --> 20:47.612
There's a boat!

20:47.614 --> 20:49.180
Whoa.

20:49.182 --> 20:50.681
Is anybody on it?

20:54.186 --> 20:56.254
TANDY:
Yeah, some hairy guy.

20:57.856 --> 21:00.191
Oh, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

21:03.862 --> 21:06.063
He's got company.

21:06.065 --> 21:08.899
Oh, dear God.

21:08.901 --> 21:11.369
Oh,
