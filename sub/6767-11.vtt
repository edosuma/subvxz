WEBVTT

00:11.010 --> 00:13.596
(indistinct chatter)

00:13.680 --> 00:15.306
David?

00:15.390 --> 00:18.184
Hey, hey, pull up a chair.

00:20.186 --> 00:21.604
You look terrible.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.107
(laughing):
Thanks.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.900
{\an1}Yeah, I pulled an
all-nighter last night.

00:25.984 --> 00:27.861
Oh, yeah.

00:27.944 --> 00:29.821
You had that, uh, American
Lit midterm this morning,

00:29.904 --> 00:30.822
I forgot.

00:30.905 --> 00:32.615
Yeah, that makes two of us.

00:32.698 --> 00:34.451
You blew off your midterm?

00:34.534 --> 00:36.119
(sighs) Yeah.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.579
{\an3}And, uh...

00:37.662 --> 00:38.580
{\an3}what about that
doctor's appointment

00:38.663 --> 00:39.581
we set up for you?

00:39.664 --> 00:42.000
Oh, I, uh, I couldn't make it.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.126
A conflict in schedules.

00:43.209 --> 00:44.294
{\an3}David?!

00:44.377 --> 00:45.545
Donna, I'm fine, all right?

00:45.628 --> 00:46.755
I don't need a check up

00:46.838 --> 00:47.839
and I don't need a shrink.

00:47.922 --> 00:48.965
I just need some sleep.

00:49.048 --> 00:51.092
Why are you acting so erratic?

00:56.890 --> 00:58.016
Define erratic.

00:58.099 --> 01:01.478
Up, down, all over the place.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.146
Out of control.

01:03.229 --> 01:04.813
I'm in control, all right?

01:04.897 --> 01:06.983
I've just had a run
of bad luck lately.

01:07.066 --> 01:08.318
It's more than that.

01:08.401 --> 01:09.152
What are you, some sort of

01:09.235 --> 01:10.028
behavioral expert
all of a sudden?

01:10.111 --> 01:11.988
{\an1}You know, not everyone
can live up to your

01:12.071 --> 01:13.156
lilly white take on life, Donna.

01:13.239 --> 01:14.657
So why don't you just back off?

01:14.741 --> 01:16.326
Fine.

01:16.409 --> 01:17.160
Fine, I will.

01:17.243 --> 01:19.454
Donna, I'm sorry.

01:19.537 --> 01:20.997
Fine! To hell with you!

01:21.080 --> 01:22.040
I don't need you

01:22.123 --> 01:23.708
and I don't need
my father either!

01:24.751 --> 01:26.169
Hey! Watch it, man.

01:26.252 --> 01:28.087
What?! What are you looking at?

01:29.464 --> 01:30.173
{\an6}What are you
all looking at?!
Hey...

01:30.256 --> 01:31.007
Are you all right?

01:31.090 --> 01:32.008
{\an1}This doesn't concern
you, all right?

01:32.091 --> 01:33.635
Get out of here.

01:33.718 --> 01:34.719
Get out of here!

01:34.803 --> 01:35.887
{\an1}David.

01:35.970 --> 01:37.472
What is wrong with you?

01:37.555 --> 01:39.474
What?

02:39.909 --> 02:42.036
♪ ♪

02:59.429 --> 03:01.306
♪ ♪

03:13.526 --> 03:15.236
♪ ♪

03:37.216 --> 03:38.134
Brandon, I don't get it.

03:38.217 --> 03:39.969
Why do you feel obligated
to have Thanksgiving

03:40.053 --> 03:41.638
every year at the house?

03:41.721 --> 03:42.931
{\an3}It's not an obligation,
it's a tradition.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.307
{\an3}And one that people
look forward to,

03:44.390 --> 03:45.433
I might add.

03:45.516 --> 03:46.976
{\an3}Now, let's figure
out who we got.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.061
We got Steve and Clare,

03:48.144 --> 03:49.646
Donna and David, Kelly,

03:49.729 --> 03:50.772
And Mark, don't forget Mark.

03:50.855 --> 03:51.814
He goes with Kelly now.

03:51.898 --> 03:52.815
They're inseparable.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.859
That's right, maybe you
should sit between them,

03:54.943 --> 03:57.153
{\an3}try to stir up
some trouble, huh?

03:57.236 --> 03:58.488
What about Tracy?

03:58.571 --> 04:00.323
Nah, she went home for
the holidays already.

04:00.406 --> 04:01.366
Here we go.

04:01.449 --> 04:02.951
Low-fat pumpkin pie.

04:03.034 --> 04:04.827
{\an3}I'm looking for
official tasters.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.496
You've come to the
right place, my friend.

04:06.579 --> 04:07.830
{\an3}I also need
a favor.

04:07.914 --> 04:08.998
{\an1}Don't worry
about it, Nat.

04:09.082 --> 04:09.999
{\an1}We'll pitch in on your
Thanksgiving dinner

04:10.083 --> 04:11.167
{\an5}for the homeless
this year.
Yeah, no problem.

04:11.250 --> 04:12.335
Oh, that's not it.

04:12.418 --> 04:13.503
That's already covered.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.880
Uh, the favor
actually is for Willie.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.298
{\an3}You know, he's sacrificed
a lot over the years

04:17.382 --> 04:18.882
to try to save
for his niece

04:18.966 --> 04:20.343
and nephew's college education?

04:20.426 --> 04:21.344
{\an6}Mm-hmm.
He's been
working his

04:21.427 --> 04:22.887
butt off, but it's not enough.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.013
He finally caught a break

04:24.097 --> 04:25.640
with a non-profit organization,

04:25.723 --> 04:26.849
Habitat For Humanity.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.351
They agreed to
build a house

04:28.434 --> 04:30.019
and then let him buy it
with a zero-interest mortgage.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.146
{\an3}Sweet.
Yeah.

04:32.230 --> 04:33.690
Willie and the kids are
putting in their 500 hours

04:33.773 --> 04:36.192
of sweat equity, but
they need extra hands.

04:36.275 --> 04:39.028
The goal is to have the
place framed by Thanksgiving.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.113
So, what do you say?

04:40.196 --> 04:41.155
Sounds good.
I'm in.

04:41.239 --> 04:42.657
Well, I'm hell
with a hammer.

04:42.740 --> 04:43.950
I bet you are!
I bet you are!

04:44.033 --> 04:45.535
Thanks.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.036
Willie will appreciate it.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.871
Tell me about your

04:48.955 --> 04:50.748
{\an3}hammer swinging
days, Val.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.041
Oh, you don't
want to know.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.377
You're right, I don't.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.007
He lost it.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.926
He just completely lost it.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.053
And here we are.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.933
Something's really wrong.

05:09.017 --> 05:11.561
I know.

05:11.644 --> 05:14.188
I begged him to
get a physical.

05:14.272 --> 05:17.525
That wouldn't
tell you anything, Donna.

05:17.608 --> 05:19.360
I've done this
dance before.

05:19.444 --> 05:20.737
Many times.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.280
Too many times.

05:22.363 --> 05:24.115
First, the person that you think

05:24.198 --> 05:25.908
you know so well

05:25.992 --> 05:28.119
becomes a stranger.

05:28.202 --> 05:29.746
{\an1}And then
rebellious.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.664
And the comes the explosion.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.916
David's mother.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.251
You don't think

05:35.334 --> 05:36.878
David has the same illness?

05:36.961 --> 05:38.254
What am I supposed to think?

05:38.337 --> 05:39.922
His behavior...

05:40.006 --> 05:41.883
He's got all the symptoms.

05:41.966 --> 05:43.259
Excuse me, Dr. Silver?

05:43.342 --> 05:44.385
Yes.

05:44.469 --> 05:45.762
How's my son?

05:45.845 --> 05:47.889
Well, his hand has been
stitched and bandaged.

05:47.972 --> 05:49.640
{\an1}Uh, the cut was deep,
but fortunately

05:49.724 --> 05:52.393
{\an1}there's no sign of nerve
or tendon damage.

05:52.477 --> 05:54.562
However, he's been

05:54.645 --> 05:55.897
quite unruly with our staff.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.940
Do you know if he's
been taking any drugs?

05:58.024 --> 06:00.109
No, I don't think so.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.569
Well, just in case,

06:01.652 --> 06:03.780
I called in a staff
psychiatrist to evaluate him.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.490
It's standard procedure.

06:05.573 --> 06:07.283
{\an1}He's with him
right now.

06:07.366 --> 06:11.329
Okay, let's run
through this again.

06:11.412 --> 06:13.331
{\an5}Let's not and say
we did, okay?
Look, kid,

06:13.414 --> 06:14.624
you want to get out of here,

06:14.707 --> 06:15.625
{\an3}and I want to go to lunch,
all right, so--

06:15.708 --> 06:16.709
So, it's no big deal.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.795
I had an argument with my
old girlfriend that's all.

06:18.878 --> 06:19.796
{\an3}Why?

06:19.879 --> 06:21.255
Because she was
giving me the third degree

06:21.339 --> 06:22.298
like you're doing right now.

06:22.381 --> 06:23.591
And why the third degree?

06:23.674 --> 06:26.010
Because I wasn't
following her agenda, okay?

06:26.094 --> 06:27.637
And what agenda was

06:27.720 --> 06:28.805
{\an1}your old girlfriend
trying to lay on you?

06:28.888 --> 06:29.806
It doesn't matter.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.474
Oh, it does to me.

06:31.557 --> 06:32.767
Well, who the hell are you?

06:32.850 --> 06:34.644
This is ridiculous.
I'm out of here.

06:34.727 --> 06:37.146
No, not until I'm done
with my agenda which is

06:37.230 --> 06:38.773
{\an1}figuring out what
is going on with you.

06:38.856 --> 06:40.525
Look, I'm just living
my life, all right?

06:40.608 --> 06:41.651
If somebody doesn't like it,

06:41.734 --> 06:42.819
that's their problem, not mine!

06:42.902 --> 06:44.028
Look, you take it easy.

06:44.112 --> 06:46.239
No, you take it easy!

06:50.118 --> 06:51.619
Do you know why you're here?

06:51.702 --> 06:53.162
Actually, no.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.373
Does this have something
to do with my fraternity?

06:55.456 --> 06:57.708
You know, we were off academic
probation a long time ago.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.002
This has nothing to do with
your fraternity, Mr. Sanders.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.295
{\an6}Good.
This has
to do with

07:01.379 --> 07:02.547
the midterm paper you turned in

07:02.630 --> 07:04.423
to your independent study class.

07:06.592 --> 07:08.845
Do you recognize it?

07:08.928 --> 07:10.304
Yeah.

07:10.388 --> 07:12.515
Then you should also
recognize this one.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.767
It was written by Brandon Walsh

07:14.851 --> 07:16.477
three years ago.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.772
They're an identical match,
word for word.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.650
{\an3}Professor Randall,
who recently took over

07:22.733 --> 07:24.902
this class, has brought charges
of plagiarism against you.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.196
Did you say Professor Randall?

07:27.280 --> 07:28.531
{\an3}Based on the
evidence at hand,

07:28.614 --> 07:31.200
it is the preliminary
recommendation

07:31.284 --> 07:32.660
of this disciplinary committee

07:32.743 --> 07:34.203
that you be expelled

07:34.287 --> 07:35.663
{\an6}from the
university.
Wait a minute,

07:35.746 --> 07:36.873
you're gonna expel me over this?

07:36.956 --> 07:37.957
{\an3}You can submit
a statement

07:38.040 --> 07:40.668
if you like, or you can
appear before a full hearing

07:40.751 --> 07:43.379
of the student conduct
committee next week.

07:43.462 --> 07:45.548
Good day, Mister Sanders.

07:45.631 --> 07:48.301
Oh, yeah, great day.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.221
Hey, Brandon.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.389
{\an3}Hey, Kel.

07:53.472 --> 07:55.057
{\an1}You know, I still
haven't gotten your RSVP

07:55.141 --> 07:57.351
{\an1}for the annual turkey
fest at Casa Walsh.

07:57.435 --> 08:00.229
{\an3}Yeah, I've been
meaning to tell you.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.565
Uh, Mark and I are
going out of town.

08:02.648 --> 08:03.524
Going out of town?

08:03.608 --> 08:04.525
Where you going?

08:04.609 --> 08:05.568
Montecito.

08:05.651 --> 08:08.029
Montecito, lovely
seaside community.

08:08.112 --> 08:09.447
Well, I'll miss you.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.240
Same here.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.242
Isn't that Professor
Randall over there?

08:13.326 --> 08:16.245
{\an3}My God, you're right that
is Professor Randall.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.706
I see he hasn't
lost his smirk.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.458
No, only his wife.

08:20.541 --> 08:22.251
{\an1}(laughing)

08:22.335 --> 08:24.295
{\an3}I wonder what Lucinda's
doing these days.

08:24.378 --> 08:25.880
Oh, believe me, Kel,
somewhere, somehow,

08:25.963 --> 08:27.048
{\an1}Lucinda's doing it
to someone.

08:27.131 --> 08:29.175
{\an3}I wonder if he
still blames me?

08:29.258 --> 08:31.886
{\an3}Well, looks like you're
about to find out.

08:31.969 --> 08:33.261
Mr. Walsh.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.263
Professor Randall,
how are you doing?

08:34.347 --> 08:36.599
{\an3}I had a feeling our
paths would cross again.

08:36.682 --> 08:39.393
Yeah, this is Kelly Taylor.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.437
{\an3}Oh, yeah, sure,
I remember Kelly.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.940
You had a class with
my ex-wife, Lucinda.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.274
Right.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.401
{\an1}So, what brings
you back to C.U.?

08:47.485 --> 08:49.237
Oh, the Department did
a little reshuffling,

08:49.320 --> 08:50.446
some recruiting
and here I am,

08:50.529 --> 08:52.281
{\an3}back on campus,
buried in term papers.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.282
Oh, sorry to hear that.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.117
You know what, I'll tell
you what's really sorry.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.953
{\an3}In all this time I've only
had a couple of students

08:57.036 --> 08:59.455
{\an3}whose prose could measure
up to your standards.

08:59.538 --> 09:03.084
You were my best
and my brightest.

09:03.167 --> 09:05.461
Anyway, nice to
see you, Kelly.

09:05.544 --> 09:08.464
{\an3}I will catch up again
with you, later.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.341
Promise.

09:13.552 --> 09:15.304
That was weird.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.431
Yeah, he still blames me.

09:17.515 --> 09:18.933
Cocktails and blinis?

09:23.062 --> 09:25.356
Now, straight out.

09:25.439 --> 09:26.899
David hurt himself today.

09:26.983 --> 09:29.193
Now, I have to ask,
is there any history

09:29.277 --> 09:30.319
of mental illness in the family?

09:30.403 --> 09:31.654
Yes.

09:31.737 --> 09:32.989
His mother.

09:33.072 --> 09:34.907
{\an1}She's struggled
with manic-depression

09:34.991 --> 09:36.325
for a long time.
I see.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.452
Okay, what I want to do

09:38.536 --> 09:40.538
is put a 72 hour hold on David

09:40.621 --> 09:42.206
for psychiatric evaluation.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.791
{\an1}I think observation
would be the best thing

09:43.874 --> 09:45.001
for him at this point.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.210
Observation?

09:46.294 --> 09:47.169
Where?

09:47.253 --> 09:48.629
In the psych ward.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.506
It's a secure,

09:50.589 --> 09:52.216
safe environment.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.968
Now, I have a solid staff.

09:54.051 --> 09:56.262
{\an1}We'll give David
a complete

09:56.345 --> 09:58.848
physical evaluation,
see if we can get things

09:58.931 --> 10:00.516
back in balance a bit.

10:00.599 --> 10:03.060
If we can diagnose him,

10:03.144 --> 10:04.687
we can help him.
And you don't think

10:04.770 --> 10:07.189
an out-patient program
would do just as well?

10:07.273 --> 10:09.233
No, I think we need time
to observe him first.

10:09.317 --> 10:11.652
{\an1}To evaluate
him properly.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.988
Now, I need
your support on this.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.536
Okay.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.331
{\an3}Now, I need you
to stop by

10:23.414 --> 10:24.332
the nurses station
on the way out.

10:24.415 --> 10:25.708
They're gonna need
some information from you,

10:25.791 --> 10:27.543
family history,

10:27.626 --> 10:28.711
contact numbers, whatnot.

10:28.794 --> 10:29.920
And I'll be in touch.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.339
All right?

10:31.422 --> 10:32.590
Thanks, Doctor.

10:32.673 --> 10:33.591
You're welcome.

10:33.674 --> 10:35.176
Don't worry.

10:35.259 --> 10:36.385
{\an3}We'll look
after David.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.511
Thank you.

10:45.269 --> 10:47.188
I need to get
in touch with Sheila,

10:47.271 --> 10:48.647
tell her what's going on.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.733
God knows she's not going
to handle this very well.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.068
Well, is there
anything I can do?

10:52.151 --> 10:53.402
I don't know, Donna.

10:54.445 --> 10:57.198
I should get back to the office.

10:57.281 --> 10:58.282
I've got patients waiting.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.201
You might as well just go.

11:00.284 --> 11:01.660
No, I'm not going anywhere.

11:01.744 --> 11:02.912
You go.

11:02.995 --> 11:04.038
I'll call if there's an update.

11:04.121 --> 11:05.915
{\an3}You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.084
David would do the same for me.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.085
Thanks for everything, Donna.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.878
Sure.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.051
{\an5}(knocking on door)
CLARE:
<i>Yeah, Habitat for Humanity?</i>

11:17.134 --> 11:18.886
Isn't that the group
President Carter

11:18.969 --> 11:20.721
and his wife are involved in?

11:20.805 --> 11:22.098
Right.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.058
Okay, well tell, uh,
Willie we'll be down

11:24.141 --> 11:27.645
{\an3}to swing a hammer as
soon as I change.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.271
No, he just walked in.

11:29.355 --> 11:30.981
Yeah, I'll tell him.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.775
Okay, bye.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.110
That was Brandon.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.486
Uh, put your hard hat on.

11:35.569 --> 11:38.114
{\an3}I kinda just volunteered
us for a barn raising.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.115
Clare...

11:39.198 --> 11:40.616
It's Habitat
for Humanity.

11:40.699 --> 11:41.784
I can't believe Willie's

11:41.867 --> 11:43.077
gonna finally get
his dream house.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.453
Yeah, that's great.

11:44.537 --> 11:45.287
What's wrong?

11:45.371 --> 11:47.498
{\an3}You look like somebody
shot your dog.

11:47.581 --> 11:48.958
{\an1}Well, they should
shoot me.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.835
{\an1}That would really solve
a lot of my problems.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.002
{\an3}Honey...

11:52.086 --> 11:53.295
{\an1}Clare, I'm an idiot.
I'm a plagiarist.

11:53.379 --> 11:54.380
They want to expel me,

11:54.463 --> 11:55.256
{\an1}they want to kick me
off campus.

11:55.339 --> 11:56.966
{\an1}I really messed up
this time!

11:57.049 --> 11:59.301
{\an4}I'm talking epic
proportions here.
Stop! Stop! You're babbling.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.928
What do you mean
you're getting expelled?

12:01.011 --> 12:03.097
{\an1}What did you do?
I, uh...

12:03.180 --> 12:06.475
I took one of Brandon's old term
papers off the computer

12:06.559 --> 12:07.852
and I, uh...

12:07.935 --> 12:09.645
turned it in with my name on it.

12:09.728 --> 12:10.771
What?

12:10.855 --> 12:11.981
{\an1}It was a bogus
class!

12:12.064 --> 12:13.190
An independent study course.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.985
We had a rookie professor
I thought it'd be a slam dunk.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.987
{\an1}Now the dean of students
and the conduct

12:18.070 --> 12:19.530
committee want my head.

12:19.613 --> 12:21.323
You're unbelievable.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.159
{\an1}I know.

12:23.242 --> 12:25.536
{\an3}To think I gave
up a prince

12:25.619 --> 12:27.538
and a Phi Beta Kappa

12:27.621 --> 12:29.790
{\an3}for a, uh, white-collar
criminal.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.792
I know.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.794
A semester and
a half to go.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.796
Why?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.631
I don't know.

12:37.715 --> 12:41.177
I was asking myself that
the whole way over here.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.804
Honestly, Clare I try to do
things the right way--

12:43.888 --> 12:45.806
even if it is the hard way.

12:45.890 --> 12:48.017
But suddenly the easy way
rears it's ugly head

12:48.100 --> 12:49.560
and I take the bait,
I'm helpless,

12:49.643 --> 12:51.645
even if it means I gotta kick
myself in the butt later.

12:51.729 --> 12:52.771
Does Brandon know about this?

12:52.855 --> 12:53.689
No. He's clueless.

12:53.772 --> 12:55.483
He didn't have anything
to do with this.

12:55.566 --> 12:56.817
Well, obviously
you have to tell him.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.027
No.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.654
No, I, I gotta fix this somehow.

13:00.738 --> 13:03.824
I gotta talk to the chancellor,
maybe he can help me out.

13:04.992 --> 13:06.952
Hey, do you think maybe, uh,

13:07.036 --> 13:08.329
you can call your father for me?

13:08.412 --> 13:09.997
{\an1}No.
No?

13:10.080 --> 13:10.748
{\an3}Why not?
Because...

13:10.831 --> 13:12.208
I'm going to change.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.834
{\an3}We're going to the Habitat
for Humanity house.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.586
{\an3}You're gonna find Brandon
and you're telling him

13:15.669 --> 13:18.214
{\an3}what's going down
before the dean does.

13:18.297 --> 13:19.507
Let's go.

13:24.553 --> 13:26.680
{\an1}I can't thank you guys enough
for comin' out here.

13:26.764 --> 13:27.973
Not a problem, Willie.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.726
{\an6}Yeah, it feels good
to get your hands
dirty for a change.

13:30.809 --> 13:33.062
{\an3}Oh, by the way, uh,
Kelly sends her regrets.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.188
She had some last minute

13:34.271 --> 13:35.356
{\an3}school stuff
to take care of.

13:35.439 --> 13:36.774
{\an3}Anything to avoid
a blister.

13:36.857 --> 13:38.359
Be nice. Be nice.

13:38.442 --> 13:41.737
{\an1}It's best to keep those two
away from sharp objects.

13:41.820 --> 13:43.239
Hey,

13:43.322 --> 13:43.906
look who's here!
Two more recruits!

13:43.989 --> 13:45.741
{\an3}Where are the
tool belts?

13:45.824 --> 13:46.742
{\an6}Do you have anything
in suede?
Hey, Sanders,

13:46.825 --> 13:48.118
grab a hammer.

13:50.829 --> 13:53.332
Go tell him, Steve.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.628
{\an1}Come on, my darlin',
I'll buy you a doughnut.

13:57.711 --> 13:59.213
(both laugh)

13:59.296 --> 14:02.049
Oh, man, you'll never believe
who I ran into today.

14:02.132 --> 14:04.051
Professor Randall.

14:04.134 --> 14:06.220
{\an1}Yeah, I heard he was coming
back to school.

14:06.303 --> 14:07.471
{\an3}Yeah?

14:07.555 --> 14:10.099
No love lost there,
I'll tell you that.

14:10.182 --> 14:10.933
Someone should tell that guy

14:11.016 --> 14:12.935
life is an adventure
in forgiveness.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.270
Ah, Norman Cousins.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.312
Very good, Steve.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.064
When did you become so literary?

14:17.147 --> 14:18.941
Hey, Bran...

14:19.024 --> 14:20.776
{\an1}Bran.

14:20.859 --> 14:23.946
Remember that term paper
you showed me last week?

14:24.029 --> 14:24.947
Yeah.

14:25.030 --> 14:25.990
{\an1}Well, uh,

14:26.073 --> 14:27.616
I took it.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.076
I, uh, I copied it

14:29.159 --> 14:30.286
and handed it in.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.453
You took my term paper?

14:31.537 --> 14:32.955
{\an1}Yeah,
but it gets worse.

14:33.038 --> 14:36.333
Uh, I handed it in for an
independent study course

14:36.417 --> 14:38.419
and...

14:38.502 --> 14:40.462
well, now that's Randall's
new class and...

14:40.546 --> 14:42.965
well, he busted me.

14:43.048 --> 14:45.259
Looks like I'm gonna
get expelled.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.931
He knows it's my paper,
doesn't he?

14:51.015 --> 14:53.142
{\an3}Yeah, he does.
And what

14:53.225 --> 14:54.977
do you think's gonna happen
to me, Steve?

14:55.060 --> 14:56.979
{\an3}Buddy, I don't know.
You don't know.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.522
Well, why don't you take
a wild guess.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.983
Randall blames me for breaking
up his marriage.

15:01.066 --> 15:03.152
He also blames me for his
getting kicked off campus

15:03.235 --> 15:04.945
{\an3}for favoring
student athletes.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.488
That was all a long time ago.

15:06.572 --> 15:07.990
What are you, a moron?

15:08.073 --> 15:09.658
It's payback time.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.493
And you gave him the ammunition.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.245
I'm sorry, Bran.

15:14.246 --> 15:16.165
You're sorry?

15:16.248 --> 15:17.207
Well, that's great,

15:17.291 --> 15:19.168
that really makes me feel
a lot better, Steve.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.629
Thanks.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.365
You mind if I come in?

15:49.448 --> 15:51.116
You've got the power.
Revel in it.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.495
I haven't heard that one before.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.165
Well, here you go.

15:58.248 --> 16:01.210
{\an1}I've got some sweats,
a couple T-shirts,

16:01.293 --> 16:04.338
{\an1}a pair of shorts
from your dad.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.424
So you two talked.

16:07.508 --> 16:08.258
We did.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.219
{\an3}And you both put
your heads together

16:10.302 --> 16:12.554
and figured it would be in my
best interest to commit me, huh?

16:12.638 --> 16:14.390
You're not being committed,
David.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.766
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:15.849 --> 16:18.102
I'm being evaluated.

16:18.185 --> 16:19.603
That's right.

16:19.687 --> 16:20.854
Against my will.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.731
Look, David, um...

16:22.815 --> 16:25.401
this whole experience will go
a lot easier for you

16:25.484 --> 16:26.735
if you help us help you.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.862
The nurse tells me

16:28.946 --> 16:30.572
you refused to take
your medication.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.574
Just say no--
that's what I was always taught.

16:32.658 --> 16:35.202
It's a mild sedative, David.

16:35.285 --> 16:36.745
It'll make you feel
a lot less anxious.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.288
Look, Doc, the only thing
I'm anxious about

16:38.372 --> 16:39.373
is when I'm getting out of here.

16:39.456 --> 16:41.375
Look, David,

16:41.458 --> 16:43.419
I know this isn't easy.

16:43.502 --> 16:44.420
I don't want the drugs

16:44.503 --> 16:46.338
and I don't want to talk
about it. End of story.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.382
If you want to make
the next 72 hours

16:48.465 --> 16:50.384
a complete waste of time,
that's your decision.

16:50.467 --> 16:53.220
{\an1}Now the labs will be ready
tomorrow morning.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.848
We've got a session
at 10:00 sharp.

17:01.603 --> 17:03.313
Good night.

17:03.397 --> 17:05.733
Good night.

17:15.492 --> 17:18.454
MAN (over PA):
Portable X-ray to ICU stat.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.455
Portable X-ray
to ICU stat.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.165
Miss Martin.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.584
(softly):
Oh.

17:23.666 --> 17:25.127
You're still here.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.337
Uh, yeah, David's father
had to go,

17:27.421 --> 17:29.423
so, uh, I thought I'd just...

17:29.506 --> 17:30.257
Stand guard?

17:30.340 --> 17:32.259
Wait for word.

17:32.342 --> 17:33.969
{\an3}How is he?
Mmm.

17:34.052 --> 17:36.972
Scared, hostile, upset,
defensive.

17:37.055 --> 17:39.641
Perfectly normal
under the circumstances.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.643
More scared than anything.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.438
Will you care to be more
specific?

17:44.521 --> 17:47.316
Yeah.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.153
Mmm.

17:51.236 --> 17:54.364
{\an1}Well, you know
about David's mother.

17:54.448 --> 17:56.825
{\an1}But, um, what you
probably don't know

17:56.909 --> 17:59.203
is that one time
I went with David

17:59.286 --> 18:01.330
{\an1}up to Portland
to see her.

18:01.413 --> 18:02.831
And she was missing.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.833
{\an1}Even the police
couldn't find her.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.044
{\an1}And it took awhile,
but we eventually

18:07.127 --> 18:10.005
tracked her down.

18:10.088 --> 18:14.218
And we found her
in this filthy alley.

18:14.301 --> 18:17.846
She was homeless,
totally out of it.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.349
She had absolutely no idea
where she was.

18:20.432 --> 18:22.017
And how did David take this?

18:22.100 --> 18:24.102
{\an1}I'll never forget
the look on his face.

18:25.103 --> 18:27.314
Dr. Tate,

18:27.397 --> 18:30.651
I think David's running
from himself...

18:30.734 --> 18:33.654
or I don't... I don't know,
maybe his mother.

18:33.737 --> 18:38.075
Am I making any sense here?

18:38.158 --> 18:40.202
A whole lot of sense.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.204
{\an3}You know,

18:42.287 --> 18:45.207
{\an3}David doesn't realize
how lucky he is

18:45.290 --> 18:47.084
to have someone like you
in his corner.

18:47.167 --> 18:50.087
But that's, uh,
perfectly normal

18:50.170 --> 18:53.215
{\an3}under the
circumstances.

18:53.298 --> 18:55.592
Look, why don't you go home
and get some rest?

18:55.676 --> 18:56.677
Hmm?

18:56.760 --> 18:58.762
Thanks.

19:01.139 --> 19:03.141
(sighs)

19:07.938 --> 19:10.732
{\an1}I don't understand,
we made the reservation!

19:10.816 --> 19:12.568
{\an1}I know,

19:12.651 --> 19:14.111
{\an1}I know we didn't call
back to confirm.

19:14.194 --> 19:16.238
{\an1}But I thought your call
was to confirm.

19:18.198 --> 19:21.118
I'm confirming now!

19:21.201 --> 19:23.203
{\an1}Would you help me
please?

19:23.287 --> 19:24.746
{\an1}The guy hates women
or something.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.206
Hi, this is Mark Reese.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.208
I understand we
have a problem?

19:28.292 --> 19:31.211
{\an3}Well, do you have any other
bungalows available?

19:31.295 --> 19:32.254
{\an3}No.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.256
Well, how about a room?

19:34.339 --> 19:36.341
{\an3}No, okay, well what
are we supposed to do?

19:38.343 --> 19:39.845
{\an3}Okay, thanks.
Terrific.

19:39.928 --> 19:40.971
{\an3}I appreciate
your help.

19:41.054 --> 19:42.222
{\an3}Bye.

19:42.306 --> 19:43.807
You fixed it?
No.

19:43.891 --> 19:46.894
He hates men, too.

19:46.977 --> 19:48.896
{\an1}Oh, great.

19:48.979 --> 19:50.856
{\an1}What are we supposed
to do now?

19:50.939 --> 19:53.150
{\an3}Well, we could pull over
and uncork the wine

19:53.233 --> 19:55.944
and whine about it or we
can find another hotel.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.779
On Thanksgiving weekend?

19:57.863 --> 19:59.114
That'll be easy.

19:59.197 --> 20:00.616
{\an3}Have a little
faith, Kel.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.117
I'm sorry.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.120
I just had my heart set
on this place, you know?

20:05.203 --> 20:06.204
{\an3}Yeah, I know, look
Montecito Ranch

20:06.288 --> 20:08.749
{\an3}isn't the only beautiful
place up by Santa Barbara.

20:08.832 --> 20:10.918
We'll find something.

20:11.001 --> 20:13.086
{\an1}I should have
called him back.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.963
{\an3}It doesn't matter
as long as there's a bed.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.465
Mark.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.842
{\an3}I mean, as long as
we're together.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.928
Destiny's taking
the reins, baby.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.304
{\an3}Saddle up.

20:22.387 --> 20:23.597
Yee-haw!

20:23.680 --> 20:25.140
(engine revving)

20:25.223 --> 20:26.975
Collusion.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.602
{\an1}That's what they're
charging me with.

20:28.685 --> 20:30.604
I don't know
what to say.

20:30.687 --> 20:31.772
Good, 'cause I'd hate

20:31.855 --> 20:33.815
{\an1}to have to listen to you
defend the guy.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.817
No, not today.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.152
What, what is this?

20:37.235 --> 20:38.987
{\an1}Why is all this coming
down on me?

20:39.071 --> 20:40.155
I'm-- what--

20:40.238 --> 20:42.532
{\an1}is this some sort
of karmic retribution

20:42.616 --> 20:44.534
{\an1}for some sordid
past life

20:44.618 --> 20:45.953
{\an1}where I was
Attila the Hun?

20:46.036 --> 20:47.162
Nope.

20:47.245 --> 20:49.164
Ran the tarot cards
on that one already.

20:49.247 --> 20:50.791
I don't know.

20:50.874 --> 20:52.793
{\an3}I mean, I
think, for me,

20:52.876 --> 20:55.295
{\an3}I'm blindly following in
my mother's footsteps.

20:55.379 --> 20:56.838
How so?

20:56.922 --> 20:58.840
{\an3}Well, my Aunt Bridget
said that my, uh,

20:58.924 --> 21:00.884
{\an3}father was my mother's
perennial project.

21:00.968 --> 21:03.929
{\an3}He was considered this big
geek before they got married

21:04.012 --> 21:06.223
{\an3}and, uh, an absentminded
professor after.

21:06.306 --> 21:07.224
Really?

21:07.307 --> 21:08.517
Mm-hmm. And now

21:08.600 --> 21:10.185
he's the chancellor
of a major university.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.186
Not bad.

21:11.269 --> 21:12.688
But he didn't cheat, did he?

21:12.771 --> 21:14.189
{\an1}No.
You know how long

21:14.272 --> 21:15.232
I've known Steve?

21:15.315 --> 21:16.817
{\an1}A long time.
No, just

21:16.900 --> 21:17.859
long enough for him to bury me.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.903
Brandon, he left here
determined to fix things.

21:19.987 --> 21:22.322
Translation-- he could screw
things up even worse.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.074
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.

21:24.157 --> 21:25.701
Did he have a game plan?

21:25.784 --> 21:27.995
Mm-hmm. Going to my father,
begging for mercy.

21:28.078 --> 21:28.912
Translation--

21:28.996 --> 21:30.205
no game plan.

21:30.288 --> 21:31.748
And clearing your name.

21:31.832 --> 21:34.001
{\an6}How thoughtful of him.
You know, if
I were you,

21:34.084 --> 21:36.169
I wouldn't want to give him
too much of a head start.

21:36.253 --> 21:37.379
I'd probably head down

21:37.462 --> 21:39.548
to the dean of students office
myself

21:39.631 --> 21:40.924
{\an3}and find out
what's going on.

21:41.008 --> 21:41.883
That's a good idea, Clare.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.218
Don't mind if I do.

21:43.301 --> 21:45.303
Thank you, bye-bye.

21:51.476 --> 21:52.894
{\an1}So, Clare told you
why I'm here, right?

21:52.978 --> 21:54.271
Oh, yes,

21:54.354 --> 21:55.731
{\an3}and I've already discussed
it with Dean Whitmore.

21:55.814 --> 21:56.690
You did?

21:56.773 --> 21:57.649
Yes!

21:57.733 --> 21:58.900
Oh, that's great.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.862
{\an3}Steve, there's nothing
great about it.

22:01.945 --> 22:04.698
{\an1}These are serious charges,
the evidence is irrefutable,

22:04.781 --> 22:07.743
{\an1}and in any event,
I never involve myself

22:07.826 --> 22:09.536
{\an1}in disciplinary matters
like this.

22:09.619 --> 22:11.371
Oh, come on, that stuff
doesn't flush with me.

22:11.455 --> 22:12.372
Look at you.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.207
You're the BMOC.

22:14.291 --> 22:15.917
Look at this office--
it's a corner office.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.127
You're the chancellor.

22:17.210 --> 22:18.420
Yeah, I'm the chancellor,

22:18.503 --> 22:19.546
{\an1}and you're dating
the chancellor's daughter.

22:19.629 --> 22:20.714
{\an1}What, you think
that entitles you

22:20.797 --> 22:22.924
to diplomatic immunity?

22:23.008 --> 22:26.219
Well, no, but
couldn't it?

22:26.303 --> 22:28.430
{\an1}Steve, you made
this mess yourself.

22:28.513 --> 22:31.349
{\an1}You're going to have
to face the consequences.

22:31.433 --> 22:32.267
But expulsion?

22:32.350 --> 22:34.269
{\an3}I only have a semester
and a half to go.

22:34.352 --> 22:35.771
{\an1}Well, maybe you should
have thought of that

22:35.854 --> 22:37.397
{\an1}before you plagiarized
that paper.

22:37.481 --> 22:38.815
{\an3}Oh, come on,
I'll do anything.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.734
{\an1}I, I'll write
another term paper,

22:40.817 --> 22:42.486
{\an1}I'll write two term papers,
whatever they want.

22:42.569 --> 22:44.321
{\an1}If they want me to scrub
the campus with a toothbrush,

22:44.404 --> 22:45.113
I'll do that.
Anything!

22:45.197 --> 22:46.323
{\an3}Tell that to the
conduct committee,

22:46.406 --> 22:47.616
see what they say.

22:47.699 --> 22:48.867
What about Brandon?

22:48.950 --> 22:51.328
{\an6}He didn't have anything
to do with this.
I believe that.

22:51.411 --> 22:53.622
As long as I've known Brandon,
he's never conducted himself

22:53.705 --> 22:55.624
with anything
other than the utmost integrity.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.626
{\an3}That's what you should have
copied from him, Steve,

22:57.709 --> 22:58.960
not his term paper.

23:01.880 --> 23:04.299
Are we finished here?

23:04.382 --> 23:06.468
Yeah.

23:08.386 --> 23:09.638
(door opens
and closes)

23:09.721 --> 23:12.599
{\an3}So, after you
lost your contract

23:12.682 --> 23:15.268
to the record company,
your grandfather died.

23:15.352 --> 23:18.480
People die.

23:18.563 --> 23:20.482
Haven't you ever lost
anybody close to you before?

23:20.565 --> 23:22.317
Yes, I have.

23:22.400 --> 23:25.529
{\an1}And how did that
make you feel-- happy or sad?

23:25.612 --> 23:27.531
Sad.

23:27.614 --> 23:32.244
{\an3}And then you came
into your inheritance.

23:32.327 --> 23:33.578
(laughing)

23:35.413 --> 23:37.874
Did my father tell you how much?

23:37.958 --> 23:39.376
You got that down there, too?

23:39.459 --> 23:40.377
Mm-hmm.

23:40.460 --> 23:42.337
I got down 250 large

23:42.420 --> 23:44.840
{\an3}and that you blew half of it
in the space of two weeks.

23:44.923 --> 23:47.968
{\an1}I didn't blow it, all right,
I invested it in a club.

23:48.051 --> 23:48.844
Watch, mark my word,

23:48.927 --> 23:50.887
{\an1}it's going to be
the biggest spot in L.A.

23:50.971 --> 23:55.684
{\an3}I'm told that your mother
suffers from manic depression.

23:57.644 --> 24:01.648
Ah, now I see what
you're getting at.

24:01.731 --> 24:05.193
You're way off, man,
I'm not my mother.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.863
{\an1}I agree,
but you must realize

24:07.946 --> 24:11.199
{\an1}that you're genetically
predisposed.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.326
{\an3}Haven't you ever
had a bad day?

24:13.410 --> 24:14.870
Haven't you ever had a hard time

24:14.953 --> 24:15.912
getting out of bed
in the morning?

24:15.996 --> 24:17.122
Of course I have.

24:17.205 --> 24:19.708
And don't tell me you wouldn't
be bouncing off the walls

24:19.791 --> 24:21.376
if you inherited a quarter
of a million dollars.

24:21.459 --> 24:23.336
I probably would.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.254
So, there you go.

24:24.337 --> 24:26.131
Nobody's perfect.

24:26.214 --> 24:27.465
Who's to say who's in control

24:27.549 --> 24:30.260
{\an3}when nobody's ever
really in control anyway?

24:30.343 --> 24:32.345
Sometimes you, you just lose it,
you know,

24:32.429 --> 24:34.264
you want to hit something,
you want to...

24:34.347 --> 24:37.058
Chuck it all?
Exactly, take a dive.

24:37.142 --> 24:38.268
Thanks, world, but no thanks.

24:38.351 --> 24:39.269
{\an1}Maybe you,

24:39.352 --> 24:42.230
but not me.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.900
I would never,
ever consider suicide.

24:44.983 --> 24:48.236
(sighs)

24:48.320 --> 24:49.404
That's not what I meant.

24:49.487 --> 24:53.909
{\an1}You know, David, uh, I know
you've been down there before.

24:53.992 --> 24:56.369
{\an1}And it probably scares you,
doesn't it?

24:56.453 --> 24:57.204
The lows?

24:57.287 --> 24:58.455
I mean,
that's why you're running,

24:58.538 --> 25:01.416
you're spending,
you're drinking.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.501
It's called self-medicating.

25:05.253 --> 25:08.215
I think...

25:08.298 --> 25:10.217
that it's time you face reality.

25:10.300 --> 25:11.384
Whose reality?
Yours?

25:11.468 --> 25:12.427
{\an1}Look, David,
I'm not suggesting

25:12.510 --> 25:13.637
that your condition is anywhere

25:13.720 --> 25:15.138
as serious as your mother's.

25:15.222 --> 25:18.433
Well, I'm glad we agree
on something then.

25:20.352 --> 25:21.770
Are we done here?

25:21.853 --> 25:24.105
Uh, I'm getting a little tired.

25:24.189 --> 25:25.607
Yeah.

25:25.690 --> 25:26.733
Okay.

25:27.692 --> 25:30.278
We're done...

25:30.362 --> 25:32.822
for now.

25:36.409 --> 25:39.204
You know, David,

25:39.287 --> 25:41.957
{\an1}you got a father out there
who loves you,

25:42.040 --> 25:44.125
{\an1}and I don't know
what your relationship is

25:44.209 --> 25:45.126
with that young lady Donna,

25:45.210 --> 25:49.798
but she obviously cares
a great deal about you.

25:49.881 --> 25:52.300
You're not alone.

26:05.397 --> 26:08.024
{\an3}No, no, no,
please, please,

26:08.108 --> 26:11.653
you have to have one room.

26:11.736 --> 26:15.323
{\an3}Okay, all right,
if anybody cancels...

26:15.407 --> 26:17.492
{\an3}No, don't hang up,
don't hang up.

26:17.575 --> 26:18.994
Don't hang up!

26:19.077 --> 26:22.330
(groans)

26:22.414 --> 26:23.331
So, how'd it go?

26:23.415 --> 26:25.834
(sighing)
Not well.

26:25.917 --> 26:28.712
What are you grinning about?

26:28.795 --> 26:29.796
Did you get a room?

26:29.879 --> 26:32.007
Nope, no rooms, no vacancies.

26:32.090 --> 26:34.259
(whimpering)

26:34.342 --> 26:37.679
{\an3}Oh, we have been
driving around all day.

26:37.762 --> 26:40.181
I'm hot and I'm tired.

26:40.265 --> 26:42.642
{\an3}I had the cutest dress I
was going to wear tonight.

26:42.726 --> 26:44.227
Well, get it out because we have
dinner reservations

26:44.311 --> 26:45.687
at the Le Plat Royal.

26:45.770 --> 26:48.189
You can't just book a
four-star restaurant

26:48.273 --> 26:49.232
at the last minute.

26:49.316 --> 26:50.400
You can if you're Ronald Reagan.

26:50.483 --> 26:51.693
You're not.

26:52.777 --> 26:54.362
{\an4}You are?
Well,
I'll make it Junior,

26:54.446 --> 26:55.989
{\an3}not Senior.
Mark, that's fraud.

26:56.072 --> 26:59.534
{\an3}This is vandalism,
that's fraud.

26:59.617 --> 27:01.077
{\an3}What's next, breaking
and entering?

27:01.161 --> 27:03.538
{\an3}Actually, I was just
getting to that.

27:03.621 --> 27:05.415
Where are we going?

27:05.498 --> 27:08.877
{\an6}(sighing)
We're going to go to the La
Playa Bonita Resort Hotel.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.712
{\an1}But you just said
we couldn't get in there.

27:10.795 --> 27:12.172
{\an3}No, I said they
didn't have any rooms.

27:12.255 --> 27:13.381
I didn't say we
couldn't get in.

27:13.465 --> 27:14.549
{\an3}Actually, my family
stayed there.

27:14.632 --> 27:15.759
Wait until you see
their health club.

27:15.842 --> 27:16.801
You'll love it, Kel.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.553
{\an3}They've got
marble walls.

27:18.636 --> 27:21.389
{\an3}They've got big fluffy
towels, sauna, whirlpool,

27:21.473 --> 27:24.392
everything your sweaty
little heart desires.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.269
{\an1}Ever heard
of trespassing, Mark?

27:26.353 --> 27:28.229
{\an3}No, it's just exploring
a brave, new world.

27:28.313 --> 27:31.524
{\an1}Oh, we are going
to get caught, I can feel it.

27:31.608 --> 27:33.651
{\an3}N-N-N-No, you just
walk in with attitude

27:33.735 --> 27:35.487
{\an3}and a sense of
entitlement and--

27:35.570 --> 27:36.571
{\an3}Look, just
repeat after me,

27:36.654 --> 27:39.282
{\an3}"My name is Kelly Taylor
and I'm from Beverly Hills."

27:39.366 --> 27:42.577
{\an1}My name is Kelly Taylor
and he made me do it.

27:45.830 --> 27:46.748
Hey, Professor Randall,

27:46.831 --> 27:48.083
{\an1}could I talk to you
for a second?

27:48.166 --> 27:49.084
What's this about, Walsh?

27:49.167 --> 27:50.085
{\an3}I've got a
class to teach.

27:50.168 --> 27:51.044
{\an1}Right, right,
well, look,

27:51.127 --> 27:53.046
{\an1}I just came from the dean
of students' office,

27:53.129 --> 27:54.756
and he explained to me
the plagiarism charges

27:54.839 --> 27:56.049
{\an1}you're bringing
against Steve Sanders,

27:56.132 --> 27:59.052
{\an1}and I just stated my innocence
for the record.

27:59.135 --> 28:01.096
Well, of course you did.

28:01.179 --> 28:03.807
{\an1}Professor Randall,
I didn't give him the paper.

28:03.890 --> 28:04.891
I told the dean that,

28:04.974 --> 28:06.142
{\an1}and he said
I should come to you

28:06.226 --> 28:07.602
{\an1}and ask you
to drop the charges.

28:07.685 --> 28:08.895
Look, I wish I
could, Walsh,

28:08.978 --> 28:11.648
{\an3}but frankly, the
evidence is overwhelming.

28:13.233 --> 28:14.275
{\an1}This is personal,
isn't it?

28:14.359 --> 28:16.444
{\an3}Brandon, why
would I do that?

28:16.528 --> 28:18.071
If you hadn't written
an outstanding paper

28:18.154 --> 28:19.280
three years ago,

28:19.364 --> 28:20.782
{\an3}I never would
have saved a copy

28:20.865 --> 28:22.158
and I never would have
noticed the plagiarism

28:22.242 --> 28:24.119
to begin with.

28:24.202 --> 28:25.453
{\an1}Professor Randall,
I know that we've had

28:25.537 --> 28:26.955
our differences in the past,

28:27.038 --> 28:28.790
{\an1}what with your wife
and Steve and your baseball.

28:28.873 --> 28:29.958
{\an3}Oh, no, whoa,
whoa, whoa,

28:30.041 --> 28:33.795
{\an3}no, no, no, the one has
nothing to do with the other.

28:33.878 --> 28:37.132
{\an3}This is an entirely different
venue of cheating, Walsh,

28:37.215 --> 28:39.134
{\an3}and as far as I'm
concerned, you are guilty

28:39.217 --> 28:40.468
until proven innocent.

28:40.552 --> 28:41.803
{\an3}Now, if you'll
excuse me...

28:56.401 --> 28:58.319
Any word on Davey Boy?

28:58.403 --> 29:00.822
Well, Donna says he's getting
help from a really good doctor.

29:00.905 --> 29:02.949
{\an3}Is he going to be out in
time for Thanksgiving?

29:03.032 --> 29:04.826
They don't know;
it's too soon to tell.

29:04.909 --> 29:08.496
{\an1}Well, on our end,
ladies, we got to move it

29:08.580 --> 29:10.874
if we want a roof up
in time for turkey.

29:10.957 --> 29:11.875
{\an3}Follow me.

29:11.958 --> 29:13.460
What are we doing?

29:13.543 --> 29:14.878
Quality control.

29:14.961 --> 29:17.172
See, this is a level, and
we're going to make sure

29:17.255 --> 29:19.132
that the window
frame is plumb,

29:19.215 --> 29:20.550
which it is.

29:20.633 --> 29:22.010
We don't want the
city inspectors holding us up

29:22.093 --> 29:24.012
with code violations.

29:24.095 --> 29:25.472
How do you know
about this stuff?

29:25.555 --> 29:27.348
My dad was a contractor.

29:27.432 --> 29:28.683
Oh, really?

29:28.766 --> 29:30.351
{\an1}Yeah, the summer
before I moved here,

29:30.435 --> 29:31.394
{\an1}he had me work
at one

29:31.478 --> 29:33.354
of his construction sites.

29:33.438 --> 29:35.190
Ten months later,
we had a shopping mall

29:35.273 --> 29:39.068
and a movie theater
with red velvet seats and...

29:39.152 --> 29:41.529
{\an1}mahogany walls
and art deco trim.

29:41.613 --> 29:45.200
Too bad he didn't stick around
to see it.

29:45.283 --> 29:46.493
Why, what happened?

29:46.576 --> 29:48.203
He blew his brains out.

29:48.286 --> 29:50.747
I'm sorry.

29:50.830 --> 29:52.373
It's okay.

29:52.457 --> 29:53.625
It was a long time ago.

29:53.708 --> 29:56.920
I know, it's just... I know
what it's like to lose a parent.

29:57.962 --> 30:00.006
That's right, your mom.

30:00.089 --> 30:03.051
Yeah.

30:03.134 --> 30:05.595
But I have good memories,
and it sounds like you do, too.

30:05.678 --> 30:07.722
A few.

30:15.396 --> 30:16.564
Well?

30:16.648 --> 30:17.690
Houston, we have a room.

30:17.774 --> 30:19.734
Mm, good.
Where?

30:19.817 --> 30:22.278
{\an1}Well, it's, uh,
it's just off the interstate.

30:22.362 --> 30:25.907
It's a Best Nest motel.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.408
{\an3}Best Nest-- that's
my favorite.

30:27.492 --> 30:28.910
{\an1}I know, I know,
I'm spoiling you,

30:28.993 --> 30:30.453
{\an1}but that's just
the kind of guy I am.

30:30.537 --> 30:31.704
Yes, you are.

30:31.788 --> 30:34.082
{\an3}Here, try this
Lobster Newberg.

30:34.165 --> 30:35.458
It's amazing.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.627
{\an1}Not until you try
some caviar.

30:37.710 --> 30:38.753
{\an1}Come on,
it's not meat,

30:38.836 --> 30:40.505
{\an1}it's not poultry,
it's just...

30:40.588 --> 30:42.298
Best Nest, eggs.

30:42.382 --> 30:43.967
Do I see a pattern
forming here?

30:44.050 --> 30:44.968
{\an1}(chuckles)

30:45.051 --> 30:47.178
Okay.

30:50.640 --> 30:53.560
Hmm... not bad.

30:53.643 --> 30:55.687
I told you.

31:11.369 --> 31:14.497
(thunder cracking)

31:39.856 --> 31:41.858
(echoing):
Mom?

31:50.283 --> 31:53.369
{\an1}Mom?

32:00.585 --> 32:03.546
(panting)

32:07.425 --> 32:09.469
Dr. Tate.

32:11.638 --> 32:13.806
Dr. Tate.

32:15.433 --> 32:18.353
Dr. Tate!

32:30.448 --> 32:32.700
{\an1}WOMAN:
Donna.

32:33.743 --> 32:35.703
Sheila.

32:35.787 --> 32:36.996
Oh, I'm so glad you came.

32:37.080 --> 32:37.830
I was in Palm Springs.

32:37.914 --> 32:40.375
{\an1}I came as soon
as I got Mel's message.

32:40.458 --> 32:41.668
How is David?

32:41.751 --> 32:43.711
{\an3}Well, apparently he's
had a rough night,

32:43.795 --> 32:46.214
{\an3}but Dr. Tate feels it could be
the start of a breakthrough.

32:46.297 --> 32:48.216
I feel so guilty.

32:48.299 --> 32:49.425
I've passed this on to him.

32:49.509 --> 32:52.095
{\an3}No, Sheila, don't
ever say that.

32:52.178 --> 32:54.389
{\an1}I never thought
that I'd be waiting

32:54.472 --> 32:56.557
{\an1}to see my son
in a place like this.

32:56.641 --> 32:57.934
{\an3}Sheila,
listen to me.

32:58.017 --> 32:59.769
{\an3}You're here and
that's what counts,

32:59.852 --> 33:01.354
{\an3}and you know better
than anyone else

33:01.437 --> 33:02.730
{\an3}how to help David
through this.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.524
Yes.

33:04.607 --> 33:06.234
Yes, you're right.

33:06.317 --> 33:08.194
You look exhausted.

33:08.277 --> 33:10.363
Why don't you go home
and get some rest?

33:11.155 --> 33:12.407
{\an1}I'm here.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.242
I'll stay.

33:14.325 --> 33:15.076
(sighs)

33:15.159 --> 33:16.411
{\an1}Are you sure?
Yes.

33:16.494 --> 33:17.662
Go on.

33:18.663 --> 33:20.623
Oh, I'm glad you're here.

33:21.666 --> 33:22.917
Thank you.

33:27.004 --> 33:30.383
(door opening, closing)

33:32.885 --> 33:34.262
What are you doing?

33:34.345 --> 33:36.055
{\an1}I'm taking this
back up to my room,

33:36.139 --> 33:38.266
out of harm's way.

33:38.349 --> 33:39.976
{\an3}Hey, Bran, I'm sorry
my bonehead play

33:40.059 --> 33:41.102
{\an3}dragged you
into this.

33:41.185 --> 33:42.103
Well, the thing is,

33:42.186 --> 33:43.229
{\an1}Randall isn't gonna
let me out.

33:43.312 --> 33:44.397
{\an1}The charge
is collusion,

33:44.480 --> 33:46.107
and he's gonna
make it stick.

33:46.190 --> 33:48.151
{\an5}I'll do
whatever I...
I don't want
to hear it, Steve.

33:48.234 --> 33:50.111
{\an1}You stole
from me, man.

33:50.194 --> 33:52.071
You took something
that was mine, that I crafted

33:52.155 --> 33:54.115
and I created,
and you put your name on it.

33:54.198 --> 33:55.950
{\an1}Now everything
that I've worked towards

33:56.033 --> 33:57.326
is about to be flushed.

33:57.410 --> 33:59.662
What kind of friend
does that make you?

34:03.207 --> 34:05.251
(sighs)

34:12.550 --> 34:13.760
{\an3}Oh, nice.

34:13.842 --> 34:15.261
{\an1}Nice.

34:15.344 --> 34:17.304
{\an1}Best Nest.

34:17.388 --> 34:18.973
{\an1}Nice.

34:20.224 --> 34:21.809
{\an1}Come here.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.311
Come sit down.

34:25.228 --> 34:27.106
{\an1}Okay, now close
your eyes.

34:27.190 --> 34:28.024
Close your eyes.

34:28.107 --> 34:29.150
Come on.
(chuckling)

34:29.233 --> 34:30.109
(clears throat)

34:30.193 --> 34:32.110
{\an1}Okay, now just imagine
we're in

34:32.195 --> 34:34.197
{\an1}our little bungalow
at Montecito Ranch...

34:34.280 --> 34:35.782
{\an3}(sighs)

34:35.864 --> 34:39.076
{\an1}with the rustic
beam ceiling,

34:39.159 --> 34:40.953
the soft lighting,

34:41.036 --> 34:46.000
{\an1}Chopin's nocturnes
wafting softly in our ears,

34:46.083 --> 34:49.712
{\an1}the flames flickering
in the fireplace.

34:49.795 --> 34:51.172
{\an3}Mark...

34:51.255 --> 34:52.965
I'm getting so hot.

34:53.049 --> 34:54.967
{\an1}Me, too.

34:55.051 --> 34:56.719
No, I'm burning up.

34:56.803 --> 34:58.012
{\an1}Yeah?

34:58.096 --> 34:59.514
{\an3}My stomach.

34:59.597 --> 35:01.015
Butterflies?

35:01.098 --> 35:02.975
{\an3}Caviar.

35:03.059 --> 35:04.018
{\an1}Huh?

35:04.101 --> 35:04.977
I'm gonna be sick.

35:05.061 --> 35:06.062
(groaning)

35:07.105 --> 35:09.690
Kel, are you okay?

35:09.774 --> 35:11.234
Kelly?

35:11.317 --> 35:13.736
(toilet flushing)

35:13.820 --> 35:15.863
{\an3}(sighs)

35:15.947 --> 35:19.659
{\an3}Lobster Newburg,
caviar, champagne.

35:19.742 --> 35:21.035
What is it, stomach flu?

35:21.118 --> 35:22.036
No, no, it's got

35:22.119 --> 35:23.704
to be food poisoning.

35:23.788 --> 35:24.997
Are you sure?

35:25.081 --> 35:27.208
{\an1}I mean, that restaurant
was four-star.

35:27.291 --> 35:30.044
All right, it's stomach flu.

35:30.127 --> 35:31.879
{\an1}(sighs)

35:31.963 --> 35:34.090
I'm so sorry, Mark.
No, that's all right.

35:34.173 --> 35:35.591
Don't worry.
It's not like I...

35:35.675 --> 35:36.592
{\an1}planned this,
you know?

35:36.676 --> 35:37.885
Yeah, I know, I know.

35:37.969 --> 35:38.928
{\an1}(grunts)

35:39.011 --> 35:40.847
{\an3}Oh, God.

35:40.930 --> 35:42.390
Oh, God, what?

35:42.473 --> 35:44.016
It is food poisoning.

35:45.852 --> 35:48.062
(Mark retching)

36:03.995 --> 36:05.830
Can we open the drapes?

36:05.913 --> 36:07.123
{\an3}No.

36:07.206 --> 36:09.876
Oh, they're so hideous.

36:09.959 --> 36:12.128
You'd rather have
direct sunlight?

36:14.839 --> 36:17.216
{\an1}You were great
last night.

36:17.300 --> 36:18.759
So were you.

36:18.843 --> 36:22.054
So sweet, so gentle.

36:22.138 --> 36:23.306
Speak for yourself.

36:23.389 --> 36:25.892
You were incredible.

36:25.975 --> 36:28.102
I didn't have the legs
to make that last run

36:28.185 --> 36:30.980
{\an3}to the bathroom, but
you got me there.

36:31.063 --> 36:33.608
And here we are.

36:33.691 --> 36:35.693
Yeah, in Shangri-la.

36:35.776 --> 36:36.903
{\an3}(chuckling)

36:36.986 --> 36:38.237
{\an1}Four-star.

36:38.321 --> 36:39.906
{\an3}The best laid
plans, huh?

36:39.989 --> 36:42.283
(both laughing)

36:44.702 --> 36:46.579
{\an3}(sighs)

36:46.662 --> 36:48.289
You know...

36:48.372 --> 36:50.958
{\an1}if we could make it
to the car,

36:51.042 --> 36:53.336
{\an1}we could get back
to Casa Walsh

36:53.419 --> 36:55.630
{\an1}in time
for Thanksgiving.

36:55.713 --> 36:59.133
{\an3}Uh, doesn't that
usually involve food?

36:59.216 --> 37:02.094
Yeah, you're right.

37:02.178 --> 37:04.847
{\an1}So, what do you
want to do?

37:04.931 --> 37:08.768
{\an3}Maybe we should just
stay right here...

37:08.851 --> 37:10.353
where we are.

37:10.436 --> 37:12.521
{\an1}Maybe so.

37:13.898 --> 37:16.817
{\an1}You know, you
are the nicest person

37:16.901 --> 37:19.195
{\an1}I've ever
gotten sick with.

37:19.278 --> 37:21.489
{\an3}I was just gonna say the
same thing about you.

37:21.572 --> 37:23.574
(both chuckling)

37:45.596 --> 37:46.764
David?

37:49.517 --> 37:51.143
Good morning.

37:51.227 --> 37:53.813
You've got a visitor.

37:53.896 --> 37:56.273
{\an1}She's been waiting
all night.

38:11.789 --> 38:14.000
What are you doing here?

38:14.083 --> 38:16.210
You didn't have to come.

38:16.293 --> 38:18.796
{\an1}You've always
been there for me.

38:18.879 --> 38:21.048
Uh, I'm-I'm...

38:21.132 --> 38:22.717
I'm doing okay now.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.468
I just, uh...

38:24.552 --> 38:27.054
{\an3}I was just a
little messed up.

38:27.138 --> 38:28.389
{\an1}When I heard
that you were here,

38:28.472 --> 38:30.349
{\an1}I was so scared
and worried, but...

38:30.433 --> 38:31.684
{\an1}you know,
I'm beginning to think

38:31.767 --> 38:33.227
{\an1}that maybe
it was a blessing

38:33.310 --> 38:34.812
{\an1}in disguise.
Mom...

38:34.895 --> 38:36.022
stop, please.

38:36.105 --> 38:37.565
Look, I love you,

38:37.648 --> 38:41.235
{\an3}and I'd... I'd do
anything for you...

38:41.318 --> 38:43.904
{\an3}but please don't try
telling me I'm you, okay?

38:43.988 --> 38:45.865
You're not me, David,

38:45.948 --> 38:49.410
{\an1}but you are my son,
and it's time for you

38:49.493 --> 38:51.203
{\an1}to listen to your mother
for a change.

38:52.204 --> 38:55.916
{\an3}Dr. Tate cataloged
me already.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.210
He says I'm a...

38:58.294 --> 39:01.088
{\an3}minor league
manic-depressive.

39:03.340 --> 39:05.468
{\an3}That's... that's
what he says.

39:05.551 --> 39:07.887
What does he know, right?

39:07.970 --> 39:09.597
You're right.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.932
He doesn't know.

39:12.016 --> 39:14.268
He's never been on the ride.

39:14.351 --> 39:17.146
{\an1}He's never had the highs
that we've had,

39:17.229 --> 39:18.355
{\an1}has he?

39:18.439 --> 39:20.775
I guess not.

39:20.858 --> 39:22.860
Fun, aren't they?

39:25.029 --> 39:27.948
{\an3}(chuckling)

39:28.032 --> 39:28.949
{\an3}Yeah.

39:29.033 --> 39:30.993
{\an3}Incredible.

39:31.077 --> 39:33.120
{\an3}It's like, when
you're on the ride,

39:33.204 --> 39:35.456
you can do no wrong.

39:38.501 --> 39:39.794
I'm fearless.

39:39.877 --> 39:42.463
Yeah... and blind.

39:45.049 --> 39:46.092
Yeah.

39:46.175 --> 39:48.636
I guess I hit bottom
in Las Vegas.

39:49.678 --> 39:51.472
When the lows come...

39:51.555 --> 39:55.017
they really swallow you whole,
don't they?

39:56.519 --> 39:59.146
{\an1}David, if you don't
have the highs,

39:59.230 --> 40:01.107
you don't have the lows.

40:01.190 --> 40:02.858
{\an3}I don't want medication, Mom.
I don't need medication.

40:02.942 --> 40:04.151
{\an1}And Dr. Tate agrees
with you,

40:04.235 --> 40:06.862
but if you want
to get out of this place

40:06.946 --> 40:08.864
and stay out of it,

40:08.948 --> 40:11.659
you need to learn
to make better choices.

40:11.742 --> 40:12.701
Like what?

40:12.785 --> 40:14.662
{\an1}Like being open
to therapy.

40:14.745 --> 40:18.040
Don't be so open to alcohol.

40:19.083 --> 40:21.127
{\an1}Do you want
to spin out again?

40:21.210 --> 40:24.004
Do you want to relive
these last few weeks?

40:24.088 --> 40:25.005
No.

40:25.089 --> 40:29.051
David, you have a choice.

40:29.135 --> 40:32.513
I did it the hard way.

40:32.596 --> 40:35.099
You don't have to.

40:36.934 --> 40:39.103
It's up to you.

40:41.147 --> 40:42.982
Okay.

40:43.065 --> 40:44.567
I hear you.

40:48.487 --> 40:50.281
Let's get you out of here.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.164
{\an6}BRANDON:
Fork goes on the left,
small one on the outside.

40:58.247 --> 40:59.665
The bigger one goes...

40:59.748 --> 41:01.750
Who's got the wine?

41:05.296 --> 41:07.840
{\an3}We have some water
glasses around here?

41:09.592 --> 41:10.551
{\an3}Okay.

41:10.634 --> 41:13.888
{\an3}Oh, Willie, move those
glasses, will you, please?

41:13.971 --> 41:16.724
{\an3}Everyone, please
sit down.

41:16.807 --> 41:18.392
{\an3}Whoa.

41:18.475 --> 41:19.393
{\an3}(grunting)

41:19.476 --> 41:20.644
Sit down, pal.

41:22.688 --> 41:23.856
Welcome home, Willie.

41:25.107 --> 41:26.108
Hey, Willie.

41:26.192 --> 41:27.860
God bless all of you.

41:27.943 --> 41:29.195
Happy Thanksgiving.

41:29.278 --> 41:31.614
(all murmuring agreement)

41:36.202 --> 41:37.453
Guys, can't you
call a truce?

41:37.536 --> 41:39.205
You're not gonna be able
to solve the problem

41:39.288 --> 41:40.706
till next week at the
student conduct meeting.

41:40.789 --> 41:42.458
It is Thanksgiving.

41:44.835 --> 41:46.086
I guess you're right.

41:46.170 --> 41:47.755
Happy Thanksgiving, Steve.

41:48.797 --> 41:50.925
Happy Thanksgiving, Brandon.

41:51.967 --> 41:53.260
(knocking)

41:53.344 --> 41:55.429
{\an1}David.
Hey.

41:55.512 --> 41:56.597
{\an1}BRANDON:
Oh, look who's here.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.265
You guys, this is unbelievable.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.683
{\an1}Sil-bear.

41:59.767 --> 42:01.268
How you feeling?

42:01.352 --> 42:02.645
{\an3}Better.
Good.

42:02.728 --> 42:04.104
Thanks for asking.

42:04.188 --> 42:05.439
{\an1}David, come sit
over here.

42:11.570 --> 42:13.280
What's up, Willie?

42:14.740 --> 42:16.784
(sighs)

42:16.867 --> 42:19.453
I still don't know
why you would want

42:19.536 --> 42:21.455
to have anything to do with me.

42:21.538 --> 42:22.915
{\an3}David.

42:22.998 --> 42:26.085
No, really.

42:26.168 --> 42:27.294
Why do you hang in?

42:27.378 --> 42:28.963
{\an1}I mean, I've never done
anything for you.

42:30.673 --> 42:31.548
That's not true.

42:32.549 --> 42:34.551
{\an3}You were my
first kiss.

42:35.552 --> 42:37.972
You were my first love.

42:38.055 --> 42:41.475
Those things are priceless.

42:41.558 --> 42:43.644
They'll stay with me always,

42:43.727 --> 42:45.980
{\an3}no matter which
way our lives go.

42:47.022 --> 42:49.817
{\an1}Well, I want you
to know one thing.

42:49.900 --> 42:51.360
I'm not crazy.

42:51.443 --> 42:52.653
{\an3}Oh, yeah?

42:52.736 --> 42:54.488
Well, then, what are you?

42:54.571 --> 42:56.198
Crazier.
(chuckles)

42:56.282 --> 42:57.533
{\an1}About you.

43:00.744 --> 43:02.371
I love you, Donna.

43:03.414 --> 43:05.124
I love you, too.

43:09.920 --> 43:12.506
{\an6}BRANDON:
You know, this is just
like Thanksgiving dinner

43:12.589 --> 43:14.758
{\an3}at my place, only
without a roof.
