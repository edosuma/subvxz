WEBVTT

00:17.893 --> 00:20.942
(Wind whistling)

01:45.647 --> 01:48.776
(SOS Morse code beeping repeatedly)

01:58.410 --> 02:01.084
(Person moaning)

02:05.459 --> 02:07.757
(Both panting)

02:07.878 --> 02:09.596
(Man): Come on!

02:11.173 --> 02:13.096
Come on!

02:14.551 --> 02:15.894
Let us in!

02:16.011 --> 02:17.934
(Woman): Open the door!
- Let us in!

03:36.508 --> 03:38.431
(Man coughing)

03:40.137 --> 03:41.514
(Grunts)

03:41.638 --> 03:43.140
- Get up.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.903
- Give me another day.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.693
One more day.

03:50.814 --> 03:53.533
- One more day
isn't gonna make any difference.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.620
- Please! Just give me some more meds.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.957
- You've had your meds, Hal.
You're getting worse.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.496
- Put me back in quarantine,

04:02.617 --> 04:04.585
just till tomorrow.

04:04.703 --> 04:06.546
I'll get better.

04:06.663 --> 04:08.586
(Wheezing, coughing)

04:08.707 --> 04:11.586
- You're not gonna get better, Hal.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.337
(Panting)

04:13.462 --> 04:15.931
- I'll--I'll take the walk.

04:16.047 --> 04:18.425
It's my choice.

04:18.550 --> 04:20.928
- Not today.

04:23.221 --> 04:26.566
- You can't do this!
It's--it's my choice!

04:27.642 --> 04:29.861
- It's my job.

04:29.978 --> 04:32.106
Make your peace.
- Mason!

04:36.276 --> 04:38.825
- He tested positive, Sam.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.448
(Coughing)

04:41.573 --> 04:44.247
- He has a choice.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.415
Let him walk.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.961
- He'll just come back.
They always do.

04:50.081 --> 04:53.881
We can't let him infect
the rest of the colony.

04:55.337 --> 04:56.384
- Mason!

04:59.382 --> 05:01.055
This isn't right.

05:01.176 --> 05:02.519
- This is survival.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.497
(Sighs)

05:34.209 --> 05:36.132
Nothing personal.

05:43.301 --> 05:46.145
- His time was up.
That's all, Sam.

05:54.771 --> 05:59.698
(Sam): In this place,
we live in fear of the common cold.

06:01.653 --> 06:04.372
The last ï¬‚u wiped out 20 people
in less than a week.

06:05.949 --> 06:07.792
So now we've got rules.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.254
You get sick,
you go into quarantine.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.966
If you don't get better,
you've got a choice...

06:17.711 --> 06:22.091
a <i>bullet or</i> a <i>long walk in the snow.</i>

06:23.633 --> 06:25.806
At least, that's how it's supposed to work.

06:30.724 --> 06:34.228
After the snow started,
the lucky ones found places like this,

06:35.812 --> 06:39.191
a place where life could exist
underneath the ice.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.614
(Buzzing)

06:45.071 --> 06:46.698
When I got here,

06:46.823 --> 06:48.825
we were hundreds living
on top of each other,

06:50.285 --> 06:51.958
everyone just thankful

06:52.078 --> 06:54.831
they'd made it out
of the cities alive.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.881
When the food ran out,

06:59.002 --> 07:01.630
most of the people
in the world died.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.133
But not the people in this place,

07:04.257 --> 07:07.477
where seeds were stored underground,

07:07.594 --> 07:11.019
kept safe for a better day.

07:30.951 --> 07:35.001
Some people, they talk about a place,
a paradise,

07:35.121 --> 07:38.671
with blue skies and birds
as far as you can see.

07:40.335 --> 07:44.340
Those are just stories.
Everybody knows that.

07:49.427 --> 07:51.145
So we hold on,

07:51.262 --> 07:54.937
hibernating,
like the last Dark Age.

07:56.851 --> 07:59.479
But it's not the cold
we need to worry about;

08:01.106 --> 08:02.403
it's each other.

08:02.524 --> 08:03.821
Briggs!

08:03.942 --> 08:05.944
- What's up, Sam?
- I need to talk to you.

08:06.069 --> 08:07.616
- Don't start.
Hal knew the rules.

08:07.737 --> 08:10.035
Blood test was positive
and he wasn't getting better.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.750
We don't have the meds
to keep fighting this flu anymore

08:12.867 --> 08:13.993
and we can't risk another outbreak.

08:14.119 --> 08:16.838
- But why do we leave it to the one guy
who loves to pull the trigger?

08:16.955 --> 08:18.923
- This colony started
with over 400 people.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.587
And I've done
too much surface time

08:20.709 --> 08:23.132
with a shotgun in one hand
and a shovel in the other.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.051
I've had my fill of blood in the snow.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.299
Now, Mason is just doing
what has to be done.

08:27.424 --> 08:30.598
- But he's not doing it right.
He didn't give him a choice.

08:32.261 --> 08:35.812
Hal wanted to walk,
not take a bullet.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.561
(Buzzer sounding)

08:39.686 --> 08:42.405
- Well, right now,
we have a bigger issue.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.945
(SOS Morse code beeping repeatedly)

08:49.070 --> 08:52.165
- Calling Colony 5,
this is Colony 7. Over.

08:54.576 --> 08:56.123
Colony 5, this is Colony 7.

08:56.244 --> 08:57.746
Come on, guys. Over.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.418
- What's up?

08:59.539 --> 09:00.836
- SOS loop from Colony 5.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.800
- SOS? You sure it's 5?
- It's gotta be.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.136
It's their code.
Marcus always checks in.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.676
- When was the last time
you had contact with him?

09:07.797 --> 09:09.094
- About seven days.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.138
They said they were gonna be down
for radio repairs

09:11.259 --> 09:13.227
and they've been dead air
until about an hour ago.

09:15.597 --> 09:17.224
(Sighs)

09:17.348 --> 09:20.067
- Okay, make an announcement.

09:20.185 --> 09:22.358
General meeting in the main hall
in 30 minutes.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.152
- Okay, for who?
- For everyone.

09:24.272 --> 09:25.945
I want you to go see Viktor, Sam.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.364
He's having a problem
with the livestock.

09:30.028 --> 09:31.575
(Sighs)

09:31.696 --> 09:33.243
- Right.

09:33.364 --> 09:35.116
- Attention!

09:35.241 --> 09:37.869
All colonists report
to the main hall in 30 minutes.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.462
I repeat,

09:39.579 --> 09:42.753
all colonists please report
to the main hall in 30 minutes.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.797
Thank you.

09:46.795 --> 09:49.389
(Clucking)

09:58.556 --> 10:01.685
- Are you gonna try
and save these rabbits too?

10:04.687 --> 10:06.280
Another stillborn litter.

10:06.397 --> 10:08.775
- Hmm, they need protein,

10:08.900 --> 10:10.902
just like us.

10:12.070 --> 10:14.038
How many are left?

10:14.155 --> 10:15.873
- Twelve in all.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.367
But this here...

10:19.786 --> 10:21.914
is the only female.

10:22.038 --> 10:24.757
(Clicking tongue, sighs)

10:24.874 --> 10:28.504
You know you're screwed
when even the rabbits won't fuck.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.302
- Let me see what I can get from Kai.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.894
(Buzzer sounding)

10:36.010 --> 10:39.435
- Mason! What's going on?

10:39.556 --> 10:41.058
- What are you talking about?

10:41.182 --> 10:43.105
- What happened up there with Hal?

10:44.936 --> 10:47.689
- Sam come running to you?

10:51.401 --> 10:54.530
- What gives you the right
to take away the man's choice?

10:58.741 --> 11:01.585
- His choice was made
when he tested positive.

11:01.703 --> 11:04.798
- That is not how we do things.
We give people a choice.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.793
It's theirs to make
regardless of the outcome.

11:07.917 --> 11:10.295
- Till they come back.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.593
Till the food runs out.

11:13.965 --> 11:18.311
- It's not a problem
until it's a problem.

11:19.971 --> 11:22.815
- You gave me this job to do.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.652
Now let me do it.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.157
- Mason!

11:31.274 --> 11:33.072
- You know...

11:33.193 --> 11:35.491
you'd think with someone
you served with,

11:35.612 --> 11:37.706
you'd give them a little more respect.

11:37.822 --> 11:40.120
(Buzzer sounding)

11:51.628 --> 11:54.632
(Jazz music)

11:56.216 --> 11:57.968
(Beep)

12:07.894 --> 12:09.362
(Chuckles)

12:09.479 --> 12:11.231
- Almost had you.

12:11.356 --> 12:13.233
- No, you didn't.

12:17.528 --> 12:18.950
What do you need?

12:19.072 --> 12:20.494
- Soy pellets.

12:20.615 --> 12:23.585
The rabbits aren't doing so hot.

12:46.391 --> 12:48.143
Where's this?

12:49.519 --> 12:52.523
- Uh, somewhere in Spain, I think.

12:55.525 --> 12:57.448
- You never give up, do you?

12:57.568 --> 12:59.491
- No.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.707
No one thought Briggs could fix
that link to that old satellite,

13:02.824 --> 13:04.371
but he did.

13:05.618 --> 13:06.915
' So?

13:08.913 --> 13:12.258
- So all that weather-modification tech
is out there.

13:12.375 --> 13:15.219
It's just buried under the ice.

13:15.336 --> 13:17.680
- Well, that's where it should stay.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.433
Buried.

13:20.550 --> 13:23.178
- Sam, somewhere,
someone is working on a fix.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.897
And when there's a thaw,
I'm gonna find it.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.610
- Will you take me with you?

13:30.727 --> 13:32.900
- There's not a lot of choice down here.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.568
You'll have to do.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.118
- Hal's gone.

13:46.743 --> 13:50.873
- Well, we live and die by our rules, Sam.

13:56.127 --> 13:57.970
- We should get to the meeting.

14:01.883 --> 14:02.884
(Lively music)

14:03.009 --> 14:04.852
Tell me baby

14:09.223 --> 14:11.271
What you gonna do

14:14.562 --> 14:16.610
Tell me baby

14:20.234 --> 14:22.111
What you gonna do...

14:25.323 --> 14:29.624
- Breathe slowly.
You can't cough, okay?

14:29.744 --> 14:32.623
- Hey, I fixed that crack
in the north vent for you.

14:32.747 --> 14:35.296
- Thanks, Sam. That's great.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.260
- Dex...

14:40.630 --> 14:42.598
You all right?

14:42.715 --> 14:44.763
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.557
- You're not looking so hot.

14:46.677 --> 14:48.224
- No, no, it's good.
I'm fine.

14:48.346 --> 14:51.350
- Maybe you should
go back to your room, huh?

15:24.215 --> 15:25.341
- All right, listen up.

15:26.926 --> 15:30.305
A few hours ago, we received
a distress signal from Colony 5.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.023
(Colonists murmuring)

15:32.140 --> 15:35.360
They haven't responded
to any radio calls.

15:35.476 --> 15:38.025
Given that Colony 3 shuttered last year,

15:38.146 --> 15:40.399
I think they're worth checking up on.

15:40.523 --> 15:43.823
Cooper, I want you to see what kind of
radio parts we have to spare.

15:43.943 --> 15:44.865
. Okay-

15:44.986 --> 15:46.954
- We've got nothing to spare.

15:48.322 --> 15:50.791
- Mason, we're sending a team,
and I'm leading it.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.751
I need two volunteers.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.964
- What if they've been hit
with a new flu?

15:57.081 --> 15:58.458
- We'll take all precautions.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.551
We'll go into quarantine
when we get back.

16:00.668 --> 16:01.965
That's what it's there for.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.838
- Quarantine's a fucking joke.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.465
We're barely surviving here.

16:05.590 --> 16:07.968
- We need to take care
of our own, Briggs.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.311
- We made a pact with Colony 5

16:10.428 --> 16:13.056
and we need to look after each other.

16:13.181 --> 16:16.105
- Yes, we did, and we're going.
End of discussion.

16:20.021 --> 16:21.193
- Dexter...

16:23.065 --> 16:26.911
I need a skilled set of hands
with me out there.

16:30.281 --> 16:32.079
- I'll go.

16:36.078 --> 16:39.378
Dex needs to stay
in case the turbines break down.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.134
(Briggs): Thank you, Sam.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.259
Anyone else?

16:49.217 --> 16:50.685
Anyone?

16:50.801 --> 16:53.054
- Take me.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.523
(Viktor): Graydon, no.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.517
- Please don't go.
- I know I haven't logged

16:57.642 --> 16:59.690
a lot of surface time,
but I can do it.

17:01.312 --> 17:02.939
- Thank you, Graydon.

17:03.064 --> 17:04.987
You'll do well.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.861
All right!

17:07.984 --> 17:10.613
Kai will be in charge until I'm back.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.580
Rations are still in effect,

17:12.698 --> 17:16.544
although I've authorized
regular portions for the children.

17:16.661 --> 17:20.165
Work details continue as usual.
We'll be in touch by radio.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.836
(Sneezes)

17:21.958 --> 17:25.087
(Colonists gasping, woman coughing)
(Man): She's sick...

17:25.211 --> 17:27.009
- Come on.

17:27.128 --> 17:28.676
(Man): Get her out of here.

17:52.989 --> 17:55.538
(Briggs): Quarantine until further notice.

17:55.658 --> 17:58.787
(Dex): It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.790
(Mason): You really should have
said something earlier, Dex.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.212
(Woman coughing)

18:09.547 --> 18:10.969
(Air hissing)

18:11.090 --> 18:12.387
They're done, Briggs.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.510
- They're sick, and we follow procedure.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.683
- They just put the whole colony at risk.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.852
We need to give them the test right now.

18:18.973 --> 18:21.772
- We're gonna wait until I get back
and see if they're any better.

18:21.892 --> 18:23.269
Until then, Kai's in charge.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.738
- You really think
she can make the tough calls?

18:25.855 --> 18:28.950
- That's really not
your decision to make, is it?

18:30.443 --> 18:32.161
Are we clear?

18:32.278 --> 18:34.201
- Crystal.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.078
(Muffled): Mom!

19:41.514 --> 19:44.017
(Panting)

19:45.309 --> 19:46.856
Oh my...

20:14.547 --> 20:16.675
- You okay?

20:19.760 --> 20:22.388
- That fucking dream.

20:24.014 --> 20:26.358
- It wasn't your fault.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.198
(Sniffles)

20:56.338 --> 20:58.716
Why don't you come back to bed?

21:00.593 --> 21:02.220
- Yeah.

21:38.506 --> 21:41.009
The world froze a long time ago.

21:41.133 --> 21:45.559
So long ago, that I can't remember
the warmth of the sun.

21:48.516 --> 21:50.735
I heard the stories growing up,

21:50.851 --> 21:55.106
how the planet grew hotter
as our fuel was burned,

21:55.231 --> 21:58.405
how we made towers
to work the weather.

22:00.319 --> 22:04.199
But the truth is, one day,

22:04.323 --> 22:06.997
it started to snow,

22:07.117 --> 22:09.586
and it never stopped.

22:11.372 --> 22:14.216
(Wind howling)

22:38.440 --> 22:41.410
(Graydon): Hey, is that what I think it is?

22:41.527 --> 22:43.370
(Sam): Weather modification.

22:45.406 --> 22:48.000
- I've never seen one this close before.

22:50.578 --> 22:52.205
Think it still works?

22:53.706 --> 22:57.210
- It did its damage a long time ago.

23:41.837 --> 23:44.716
(Bridge creaking)

23:46.216 --> 23:48.514
- We gotta cross this thing?

23:49.762 --> 23:52.015
- Unless you wanna go down there...

24:32.680 --> 24:35.274
- We make our way around on the left.

24:35.391 --> 24:36.893
- Yeah.

24:48.529 --> 24:51.203
(Briggs): Whoa!
(GraVdQTUI Oh! Whoa!

24:58.414 --> 25:00.633
- Watch your step.

25:25.441 --> 25:27.739
' Guys!

25:29.028 --> 25:30.871
What is that?

26:17.493 --> 26:20.793
- What the hell is he doing out here?

26:41.266 --> 26:43.360
- We gotta keep moving.

27:58.051 --> 28:01.646
- God, how cool would it be
to fly one of these things, huh?

28:01.763 --> 28:03.936
Hey, Briggs, what was this used for?

28:04.057 --> 28:05.559
- Medevac.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.278
Used to airlift people to safety.

28:10.355 --> 28:12.153
- I wish I could have seen that.

28:13.859 --> 28:16.533
- Briggs to Colony 7.
Cooper, come in.

28:16.653 --> 28:18.655
(Static)

28:18.780 --> 28:22.034
- Colony 7 here.
Good to hear your voice, Briggs.

28:22.159 --> 28:24.082
- Copy that.
Good to hear yours.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.706
We're camped out at the helicopter
for the night,

28:26.830 --> 28:29.379
so we should reach Colony 5
by noon tomorrow.

28:29.499 --> 28:30.591
What about you?
Got any news?

28:31.710 --> 28:33.838
- Dex and Elena are still in quarantine

28:33.962 --> 28:35.680
and they're both getting worse.

28:36.924 --> 28:39.928
They have all the symptoms.
Mason's pushing for the test.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.814
- Mason knows that's against protocol.

28:43.931 --> 28:47.060
That's why I left Kai in charge.

28:47.184 --> 28:49.733
- Yeah, he's not too happy about that.

28:49.853 --> 28:51.275
- I know.

28:51.396 --> 28:54.070
There's gonna be some changes made
when I get back.

28:54.191 --> 28:57.445
Cooper, you have my authority
to use force if necessary.

28:57.569 --> 29:01.199
Mason is not to take them
for a walk without my consent.

29:01.323 --> 29:03.041
- I understand.

29:03.158 --> 29:06.207
You guys be safe out there, okay?
Over and out.

29:06.328 --> 29:08.046
- Over and out.

29:09.164 --> 29:12.008
(Sighs)

29:22.719 --> 29:24.392
(Chuckles)

29:40.237 --> 29:43.332
- We could give you
some time alone with that or...

29:47.494 --> 29:48.620
(Chuckles)

29:48.745 --> 29:50.088
- Maybe...

29:50.205 --> 29:51.502
(Laughing)

29:55.794 --> 30:00.140
- You know, Sam,
we're not too far from where I found you.

30:01.842 --> 30:03.185
- Yeah.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.521
- What were you doing out here?

30:05.637 --> 30:07.685
- Well...

30:07.806 --> 30:10.355
it was a long time ago.

30:10.475 --> 30:14.480
- Go on, tell him.
We've got all night.

30:18.191 --> 30:21.661
- Um, my family, um...

30:22.446 --> 30:27.623
we were holed up about
40 miles north of here in a mine.

30:27.743 --> 30:31.464
Uh, just us, some mining families

30:31.580 --> 30:34.629
and a couple of old-timers.

30:34.750 --> 30:37.128
We, uh, got supplies in there,

30:37.252 --> 30:40.347
shovelled the entrance out every day.

30:43.133 --> 30:46.057
Eventually, the supplies ran out.

30:46.178 --> 30:48.306
Food ran out.

30:51.808 --> 30:55.813
So after we ate the horses and the dogs...

30:57.439 --> 31:00.033
my dad and the other men
went into the city

31:00.150 --> 31:02.118
to go get some help, but...

31:03.195 --> 31:05.789
they never came back, so...

31:08.658 --> 31:11.161
And people started dying.

31:11.286 --> 31:12.833
The way things were going,

31:12.954 --> 31:15.082
I needed to get them
out of there,

31:15.207 --> 31:16.925
my mother and my sister.

31:18.794 --> 31:21.547
I figured we had
a better chance out there.

31:21.671 --> 31:23.298
(Sighs)

31:23.965 --> 31:26.889
Anyway, a storm came up and...

31:28.512 --> 31:32.562
we got separated
and I never saw them again.

31:32.682 --> 31:36.937
I'd be dead too
if Briggs hadn't found me.

31:37.062 --> 31:41.283
- You were a boy, Sam.
You did the best you could.

31:43.443 --> 31:45.286
- Yeah.

32:45.839 --> 32:47.557
- Hey, what is this?

32:48.508 --> 32:51.057
Guys, that's blood.
We shouldn't be going in there.

32:51.178 --> 32:53.351
- We came here to help.
That's what we're gonna do.

33:03.773 --> 33:05.446
- You smell that?

33:05.567 --> 33:07.410
- Smoke.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.250
(Graydon coughs)

33:20.165 --> 33:22.384
(Flare hitting ground)

33:52.197 --> 33:55.326
- You know, maybe one of us
should just stay topside, huh?

33:55.450 --> 33:57.373
- We stick together.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.460
You're coming.

34:02.207 --> 34:04.505
(Weakly): Right.

34:34.781 --> 34:36.203
(clanging)

34:49.545 --> 34:51.547
(Sam): How many were there at last count?

34:51.672 --> 34:53.300
- Fifty.

34:53.425 --> 34:56.395
Not so much of a welcoming committee
this time.

35:22.704 --> 35:24.581
- What the fuck happened here?

35:30.795 --> 35:34.550
- Hey, you remember how to use this?

35:34.674 --> 35:37.928
- Yeah.
- You sure?

35:40.388 --> 35:43.767
- Let's move, okay?
- This way.

36:02.452 --> 36:05.171
(Water dripping)

36:32.065 --> 36:35.114
- They're all dead.
- We don't know that for sure.

36:35.235 --> 36:37.158
(Distant noise)

36:38.405 --> 36:40.749
(Banging)

36:40.865 --> 36:42.742
- What the fuck was that?

36:56.381 --> 36:58.850
(Repeated banging)

37:14.190 --> 37:16.318
- Someone's alive.

37:20.947 --> 37:23.666
It's coming from over here.
- Sam, wait, wait, wait.

37:35.879 --> 37:37.677
- In here.

37:43.803 --> 37:46.397
- This door's taken
a lot of punishment.

37:46.514 --> 37:49.734
- Shit! Hey, come on,
let's get the hell out of here, huh?

37:49.851 --> 37:52.195
- Hey! Find a spine, boy.

38:17.921 --> 38:19.548
(Click)

38:21.716 --> 38:23.593
You got it?

38:55.375 --> 38:57.628
- Is he dead?

39:09.514 --> 39:11.642
(Screaming)

39:11.766 --> 39:12.983
- Shit!

39:13.977 --> 39:17.948
Calm down!
Calm down! Calm down!

39:18.064 --> 39:19.737
(Whimpers)

39:19.858 --> 39:21.360
- Don't! Don't!

39:21.484 --> 39:23.202
(Sam): Shh, shh...
(Briggs): Easy, easy...

39:23.319 --> 39:24.411
- Please, don't!

39:24.529 --> 39:25.951
- We're here to help.

39:27.240 --> 39:29.117
- Please! D-don't!

39:29.242 --> 39:31.836
(Sam): Shh... It's okay.

39:31.953 --> 39:33.751
Calm down.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.171
Are you hurt?

39:37.292 --> 39:39.135
- Are they gone?

39:39.252 --> 39:40.549
' Who?

39:40.670 --> 39:43.719
- The door!
Lock the door!

39:44.924 --> 39:46.597
- Get the door!

39:49.095 --> 39:50.813
- He needs water.

39:55.393 --> 39:58.272
- No, easy. Go easy.
Easy, easy, easy.

39:59.355 --> 40:00.777
(Sighs)

40:00.899 --> 40:02.151
What's your name?

40:02.275 --> 40:03.492
- Leland.

40:03.610 --> 40:05.157
- Leland...

40:05.278 --> 40:07.326
- Have you got any food?
I'm so hungry.

40:07.447 --> 40:09.245
- Yeah, I've got some in here.

40:09.365 --> 40:11.459
- How long have you been locked in here?

40:11.576 --> 40:14.830
- L--l don't know.
Days.

40:16.164 --> 40:19.634
- Is there anyone else?
Is anyone else alive?

40:19.751 --> 40:21.378
- Define alive.

40:21.502 --> 40:23.049
(Chuckles)

40:24.839 --> 40:26.682
That's good. Mm!

40:26.799 --> 40:28.722
(Leland chewing)

40:28.843 --> 40:30.811
- We're from Colony 7.

40:30.929 --> 40:33.728
We got your distress signal.

40:33.848 --> 40:35.725
We came to help.

40:38.227 --> 40:39.900
- Leland...

40:40.021 --> 40:42.240
What happened?

40:42.357 --> 40:46.954
- We fixed the steel grid
to a new antenna.

40:47.070 --> 40:50.495
When--when it finally worked,

40:50.615 --> 40:53.585
its reach was amazing.

40:54.953 --> 40:59.880
We received a... partial transmission.

41:07.423 --> 41:09.926
You're gonna love this.

41:10.051 --> 41:12.474
- I repeat, we have modified
a weather tower

41:12.595 --> 41:15.144
and successfully reversed
the cooling process.

41:15.264 --> 41:18.939
Clouds have receded to a 3-mile radius
and are expanding.

41:19.060 --> 41:21.313
We have thawed permafrost.

41:21.437 --> 41:24.111
We have melted pack ice.

41:24.232 --> 41:27.486
We now have soil.
We have sun.

41:27.610 --> 41:32.457
We now have the conditions to grow,
but we have no seeds.

41:32.573 --> 41:34.450
If anyone out there can hear this,

41:34.575 --> 41:36.452
I repeat, our location.

41:36.577 --> 41:39.171
Our location:
latitude 47 degrees north.

41:39.288 --> 41:42.212
(Static)

41:42.333 --> 41:45.382
(Sam): Is that it'?
Is that all there is?

41:47.755 --> 41:50.554
- We triangulated the transmission

41:50.675 --> 41:53.849
and sent a team to find the source.

41:53.970 --> 41:57.565
But they never found it.

41:59.100 --> 42:01.444
But somebody found them.

42:03.563 --> 42:05.736
(Crying): And followed them
right back here.

42:05.857 --> 42:07.359
' Who?

42:07.483 --> 42:08.826
Leland, who followed you?

42:09.652 --> 42:11.575
Here. Look at me.

42:11.696 --> 42:14.575
Over here.
Show me, on this map.

42:14.699 --> 42:17.248
Where did that transmission come from?

42:17.368 --> 42:19.086
Point. We're right here.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.669
- North, on this line.

42:22.790 --> 42:25.589
And 25 degrees is here.

42:26.878 --> 42:29.381
South... There.

42:32.425 --> 42:34.473
- Listen to me.

42:34.594 --> 42:37.268
We're gonna take you back
to Colony 7 with us.

42:37.388 --> 42:39.607
- No, please, sir.
I-I'm gonna stay here.

42:39.724 --> 42:41.351
Right here, behind this door.

42:41.476 --> 42:44.229
What if they're still here?
- There's no one here.

42:46.189 --> 42:49.238
We only knew that you were here
because of the knocking.

42:51.611 --> 42:53.830
- Yeah, but I didn't knock.

42:53.946 --> 42:56.415
They're still here!

42:57.742 --> 42:59.494
(Sobbing): They're still here.

42:59.619 --> 43:00.871
- Radio Colony 7.

43:00.995 --> 43:04.169
You tell them we're on our way back.
Time for us to pack up and go.

43:04.290 --> 43:05.712
Take anything we can carry.

43:05.833 --> 43:08.052
- Okay. It's okay.
It's all right.

43:11.339 --> 43:13.307
(Static)

43:13.424 --> 43:15.267
- Calling Colony 7.

43:15.384 --> 43:18.388
Colony 7, can you read me? Over.

43:20.807 --> 43:22.775
Colony 7, come in!

43:24.060 --> 43:27.030
This is Graydon calling in.
Can you read me? Over.

43:27.146 --> 43:29.194
It's not working.

43:29.315 --> 43:31.738
- All right, we're too deep underground.

43:31.859 --> 43:34.112
We'll radio ahead
when we get back topside.

43:35.404 --> 43:38.999
You, Leland, you're coming with us.

43:39.117 --> 43:42.337
- You don't understand!
It's safe behind this door!

43:42.453 --> 43:44.797
(Sam): There's 5O colonists.
You're the only one behind it.

43:44.914 --> 43:48.839
- L--l couldn't open it.
I--l just couldn't.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.587
(Screaming in distance)

43:59.053 --> 44:01.897
(Bang, screaming)

44:05.810 --> 44:07.687
(Briggs): Get him on his feet.

44:10.815 --> 44:12.909
- No, please.
- Come on, let's go.

44:16.529 --> 44:19.203
(Bang, screaming)

44:19.323 --> 44:21.291
- What the fuck was that?

44:28.082 --> 44:29.629
* No!

44:30.668 --> 44:31.794
Shit!

44:34.881 --> 44:36.758
He locked himself back inside.

44:36.883 --> 44:38.931
- Come on.

44:41.220 --> 44:44.474
(Moaning in distance)

44:45.600 --> 44:47.227
(Sam): Graydon, let's go!

44:49.145 --> 44:51.614
(Woman in distance): No!

45:00.072 --> 45:03.542
(Bang, woman sobbing)

45:09.790 --> 45:12.134
(Creaking)

45:20.259 --> 45:23.012
(Woman wailing, bang)

45:27.725 --> 45:29.853
No!

45:32.313 --> 45:34.611
(Bang)
No!

45:39.403 --> 45:42.282
(Chains clanking)

45:56.045 --> 45:57.888
(Bang)

45:59.966 --> 46:03.470
(Metal object being dragged, clank)

46:03.594 --> 46:05.892
(Whispering): We shouldn't be here.

46:06.013 --> 46:07.890
This has nothing to do with us.

46:08.015 --> 46:10.017
(Whispering): Turn that light out.

46:14.313 --> 46:17.613
(Repeated banging)

46:47.888 --> 46:49.310
My God...

47:02.486 --> 47:04.238
(Graydon whimpers)

47:07.366 --> 47:08.743
(Sniffing)

47:11.537 --> 47:12.959
(Gunshot)

47:17.710 --> 47:18.711
(Screaming)

47:18.836 --> 47:20.258
(Gunshot)

47:21.422 --> 47:22.969
(Snarling)

47:29.972 --> 47:31.599
We gotta go, Sam.

47:31.724 --> 47:34.978
(Screeching)

47:35.102 --> 47:36.399
Now!
(Gunshot)

47:40.024 --> 47:42.152
(All snarling)

47:43.652 --> 47:46.121
(Panting and whimpering)

47:47.239 --> 47:50.118
(Distant screaming)

47:50.951 --> 47:52.373
(Gunshot)

47:52.495 --> 47:54.714
Go, go, go, 90!

48:07.718 --> 48:09.345
- Come on!

48:18.270 --> 48:20.022
- Fuck...

48:21.273 --> 48:23.867
(Screaming)
(Gunfire)

48:33.744 --> 48:34.916
(Shouting)

48:42.253 --> 48:43.630
(Screams)

48:57.309 --> 48:59.812
- Come on, Sam.
Come on!

49:01.605 --> 49:04.074
Damn! Graydon.

49:11.031 --> 49:12.624
(Man screaming)

49:12.741 --> 49:15.460
He's gone.
We gotta move.

49:15.578 --> 49:17.797
Go on. Go!

49:35.097 --> 49:36.940
GO! GQ!

49:44.148 --> 49:45.821
- Come on!

49:47.693 --> 49:49.866
(Man howling)
(Gunfire)

49:53.824 --> 49:55.292
Fuck! I'm out!

49:55.409 --> 49:57.537
- Come on! Go, go!

50:14.011 --> 50:15.638
(Both snarling)

50:57.638 --> 51:00.016
(Panting)

51:01.141 --> 51:03.815
(Man howling)

51:25.040 --> 51:27.088
(Snorting)

51:29.628 --> 51:32.677
(Screaming)

51:41.599 --> 51:43.226
- Briggs!

51:43.350 --> 51:44.522
(Voice echoing)

51:45.728 --> 51:48.447
Here, give me your hand.
Give me your hand!

51:55.863 --> 51:57.991
There are still people alive down there.

51:58.115 --> 51:59.367
- We can't help them, Sam.

52:01.076 --> 52:02.749
We can't help them.

52:59.968 --> 53:02.642
(Panting)

53:23.367 --> 53:26.291
- Briggs, don't you think
we should keep moving?

53:26.412 --> 53:30.042
- No, the temperature's dropping too fast.
We won't make it.

53:33.711 --> 53:36.055
Come on.

53:50.644 --> 53:53.989
- Briggs?
- Yeah?

53:56.150 --> 53:58.118
- Those people...

53:59.862 --> 54:01.705
how can they...

54:03.323 --> 54:05.417
- I don't know, Sam.

54:07.161 --> 54:09.038
When people are desperate,
they'll do...

54:10.664 --> 54:12.211
horrible things to survive.

54:15.586 --> 54:18.214
I told you I was an army captain

54:18.338 --> 54:20.932
during the relief effort, right?

54:21.049 --> 54:22.517
- Yeah.

54:24.011 --> 54:26.139
- Yeah, well, I never told you what I saw.

54:27.639 --> 54:29.482
When...

54:29.600 --> 54:31.694
when people lose control like that,

54:33.312 --> 54:35.781
when we go feral...

54:37.733 --> 54:41.033
there's nothing human left in us at all.

54:41.153 --> 54:44.703
We might as well just be
a pack of wild dogs.

54:49.036 --> 54:51.084
See, during the relief effort,

54:51.205 --> 54:55.961
we had, uh, 20,000 people
corralled in a stadium.

54:57.586 --> 55:01.841
Food got handed out.
The sick got treated.

55:03.592 --> 55:05.435
But when the food ran out...

55:06.678 --> 55:08.396
the people with guns

55:08.514 --> 55:10.892
started taking things
from the people without guns.

55:11.850 --> 55:13.523
And then

55:14.478 --> 55:16.480
when there was nothing left to take...

55:17.773 --> 55:19.525
they took people upstairs

55:19.650 --> 55:21.527
and decided who would live
and who would die.

55:27.825 --> 55:30.920
It was... it was the hunger.

55:31.036 --> 55:34.506
People couldn't take it.
It just drove them mad.

55:36.667 --> 55:39.796
We tried to stop it,
we really did, but...

55:41.004 --> 55:42.347
we couldn't.

55:48.095 --> 55:50.018
Me and Mason -
he was in my squad back then -

55:50.138 --> 55:53.062
we--we left and tried to find a place

55:53.183 --> 55:56.437
where we could make sure
that nothing like that would happen.

55:56.562 --> 55:58.530
(Sighs)

56:01.400 --> 56:03.448
- You did.

56:05.112 --> 56:07.160
- Maybe.

56:08.365 --> 56:09.617
- You did.

56:16.039 --> 56:18.258
That transmission...

56:20.043 --> 56:21.886
- When we get back,

56:22.004 --> 56:25.599
we'll patch into the satellite
and take a look.

56:27.092 --> 56:30.062
If they've got the sun,
we've got the seeds.

56:56.204 --> 56:57.421
- No...

56:58.540 --> 57:00.713
No, no, no!
- How many?!

57:02.044 --> 57:05.139
- Twenty! Maybe more!
It's hard to tell!

57:05.255 --> 57:07.007
Oh fuck...

57:10.636 --> 57:12.388
Our footprints!

57:12.512 --> 57:14.355
Shit! We're gonna lead them
back to the colony!

57:14.473 --> 57:16.441
- We'll stop them at the bridge.
Come on.

57:43.335 --> 57:45.178
Come on.

58:06.566 --> 58:07.943
Come on!

58:23.834 --> 58:25.711
' Briggs, what are you doing?!
- Stopping them!

58:41.018 --> 58:42.270
Block the wind!

58:46.481 --> 58:48.449
Okay-

59:03.999 --> 59:05.751
No!

59:05.876 --> 59:07.674
- What?
- The fuse is out!

59:07.794 --> 59:08.886
- Fuck!

59:11.256 --> 59:13.759
- I'm gonna relight it.
- What are you doing? Briggs!

59:13.884 --> 59:15.306
- Listen to me.
We're fine.

59:15.427 --> 59:17.145
I light it.
I come back.

59:17.262 --> 59:19.105
We go home.
- It's too late!

59:20.849 --> 59:22.351
(Groaning)

59:27.814 --> 59:29.282
Briggs!

59:40.952 --> 59:42.795
- Come on!

59:47.334 --> 59:48.677
- Come on.
Get it done.

59:49.711 --> 59:51.133
- Come on! Come on!

59:51.254 --> 59:53.256
(Screeching)

01:00:00.889 --> 01:00:03.233
(Screaming)

01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:04.567
Yes!

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:12.359
Come on, you dogs!

01:00:18.573 --> 01:00:19.620
(Screaming)

01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:52.403
(Bridge creaking)

01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:31.127
(Rifle bolt clicking)

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:36.094
(Elena whimpering)

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:44.182
- Please. Just give her
the goddamn test!

01:02:44.302 --> 01:02:45.804
- No more tests.

01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:49.684
- No! Oh no! No!

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:52.311
(Dex sobbing)

01:02:58.066 --> 01:02:59.989
- Mason!

01:03:07.575 --> 01:03:10.419
- Things are gonna change around here.

01:03:10.537 --> 01:03:12.335
- Are you fucking crazy?

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:13.422
- No.

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:15.963
I'm seeing things clearly.

01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:18.052
You know the test is bullshit.

01:03:18.169 --> 01:03:20.638
The delayjust puts us all at risk.

01:03:20.755 --> 01:03:23.053
- Drop... your gun!

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:34.811
- Help!

01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:39.483
Help!!!

01:03:39.607 --> 01:03:40.904
- Sam?

01:03:41.026 --> 01:03:42.903
Sam!

01:03:44.612 --> 01:03:45.989
- Oh fuck!

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:51.165
Fuck!

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:06.388
_ Sam!

01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:09.850
Sam! Sam...

01:04:09.971 --> 01:04:12.474
Come on, come on.

01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:34.754
- Hey, you're okay.
You're safe.

01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:41.761
- How long have I been out?

01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:43.880
- A few hours.

01:04:49.094 --> 01:04:50.892
(Gulping)

01:04:51.012 --> 01:04:53.891
(Sam breathing heavily)

01:04:55.266 --> 01:04:58.520
- Sam? Where is he?

01:04:58.645 --> 01:05:00.739
Where's my boy?

01:05:07.821 --> 01:05:10.165
- I tried.

01:05:13.118 --> 01:05:14.791
- No...

01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:16.504
(crying)

01:05:16.621 --> 01:05:18.123
* No!

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:21.468
- We lost Briggs too.

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:32.353
What are you doing?

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:37.643
- There's been a change in command.

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.610
We need to take precautions.

01:05:39.727 --> 01:05:42.196
Briggs' rules don't work anymore.

01:05:42.313 --> 01:05:44.941
We need to be tougher to survive.

01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:47.990
From now on,
rations will be cut in half.

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:51.490
Anyone showing signs of sickness
will be tested immediately.

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:54.333
If you don't pull your weight,
you don't eat.

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:55.953
- Mason!

01:05:57.036 --> 01:05:58.583
Where's Kai?

01:05:58.705 --> 01:06:00.878
- What happened, Sam?

01:06:00.999 --> 01:06:03.343
What happened out there?

01:06:07.088 --> 01:06:09.216
- They killed them.

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:14.020
Everybody at Colony 5 is dead.

01:06:17.265 --> 01:06:19.609
Briggs cut them off at the bridge.

01:06:19.726 --> 01:06:21.444
Stopped them.

01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:23.814
- Stopped who?
- These people...

01:06:25.273 --> 01:06:28.823
they slaughtered everybody...

01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:30.866
for food.

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:33.035
Do you understand?

01:06:34.407 --> 01:06:35.454
And they're coming here.

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:39.455
And unless we get out of here,
they will kill us.

01:06:39.579 --> 01:06:42.332
- And where are we gonna go?

01:06:42.457 --> 01:06:45.131
- There's a thaw.
I know where it is, okay?

01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:47.970
I can get us out of here.
I can show you where--

01:06:48.087 --> 01:06:49.839
- He's in shock.
Give him a sedative.

01:06:49.964 --> 01:06:51.716
- Let me show you where it is.

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:55.471
- No one's going anywhere.
Viktor, let's go topside.

01:06:55.595 --> 01:06:57.097
- You need to listen to me!
- Viktor!

01:06:58.181 --> 01:06:59.603
Are you with me?

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:04.279
- Mason, you need to listen to me.

01:07:04.395 --> 01:07:06.363
Mason!

01:07:07.732 --> 01:07:09.200
Mason!

01:07:22.622 --> 01:07:24.169
- Sam...

01:07:37.512 --> 01:07:40.186
- No. Nothing.

01:07:43.476 --> 01:07:47.231
You know, Sam's a lot of things,
but he's not a liar.

01:07:47.355 --> 01:07:51.201
If he says something's coming for us,
we better be ready for them.

01:07:51.317 --> 01:07:52.785
(Blows)

01:07:53.987 --> 01:07:56.410
- Keep an eye on the monitors.

01:08:03.413 --> 01:08:05.165
(Sighs)

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:11.888
_ Sam!

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:14.804
- Oh my God, are you okay?
Oh my God! Did he hit you?

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:15.891
- It's fine.

01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:17.555
- Did he hit you?!
- I'm fine!

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:21.935
Are you okay?
- Give me a sec.

01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:33.238
- Ah...
- There. Come here.

01:08:36.571 --> 01:08:38.698
- What happened out there?

01:08:41.408 --> 01:08:44.127
- I gotta show you something.

01:08:57.759 --> 01:08:59.227
- Bring up 2.

01:09:05.558 --> 01:09:07.276
- Nothing.

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:09.862
- This is bullshit!

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:11.947
- Mason!

01:09:12.939 --> 01:09:15.283
Sam got away.

01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:17.698
- And how did he do that?

01:09:24.452 --> 01:09:26.625
Rowan. That little bastard!

01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:29.044
Come on, let's go!

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.305
- 47 above the line...

01:09:36.421 --> 01:09:38.515
- What are you looking for?
- A thaw.

01:09:38.633 --> 01:09:40.350
Come on.

01:09:40.468 --> 01:09:41.970
- Sam...

01:09:42.095 --> 01:09:45.064
Sam, there is nothing there.
I've already looked.

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.479
- No, it's here.
I know it's here.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.725
- Sam...

01:09:54.691 --> 01:09:56.819
- Come on.

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:03.165
There it is.

01:10:03.282 --> 01:10:05.535
- Holy shit!

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:08.083
- Look...
- Oh my God!

01:10:09.789 --> 01:10:11.962
That's gotta be, like,
8 miles of blue sky!

01:10:12.083 --> 01:10:13.835
- Let's go. Come on.

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:17.639
- They took the weapons,
the maps, everything.

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:20.767
- Shit! They didn't take these.

01:10:22.301 --> 01:10:23.644
- What are you doing, Sam?

01:10:25.346 --> 01:10:27.644
Sam, what are you doing?
- We need to tell the others

01:10:27.765 --> 01:10:30.518
and we need to get the hell out of here.
Let's go. Come on.

01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:37.530
Come OH, come OH, come OH.

01:10:42.196 --> 01:10:44.745
- Going somewhere?
- Yeah.

01:10:44.866 --> 01:10:47.289
We're getting everyone together
and we're leaving.

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:48.753
- No one's leaving.

01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:51.214
- Go fuck yourself, Mason!
- Hey!

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:54.883
If we don't leave right now--

01:10:55.001 --> 01:10:57.550
- Briggs is gone.
I'm running things now.

01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:00.469
- When everyone's dead, huh,

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:03.264
and you're king of the fucking castle,
then what?

01:11:05.553 --> 01:11:07.100
- I'll still be running things.

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:10.642
(Banging)

01:11:13.227 --> 01:11:14.524
(Banging)

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:17.694
- Oh shit!

01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:20.698
We're too late.

01:11:31.996 --> 01:11:33.919
(clanging)

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.678
- Oh my God! It's Dex.

01:11:53.184 --> 01:11:54.606
- Believe me now?

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:57.822
- Anyone who can fire a weapon,
get them to the entrance.

01:11:57.939 --> 01:12:00.692
We'll hold them there.
And get everybody else to the vault!

01:12:00.817 --> 01:12:02.615
- Let's go. Go on!

01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:11.411
(Banging)

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:16.090
- Come on, buddy, let's go.
It's gonna be all right.

01:12:16.207 --> 01:12:18.130
Come on, guys!

01:12:18.251 --> 01:12:20.595
Let's go! Let's go!

01:12:20.711 --> 01:12:24.011
(Bang, clattering)

01:12:31.722 --> 01:12:35.522
(Thud, clattering)

01:12:45.236 --> 01:12:47.955
(Repeated banging)

01:13:00.334 --> 01:13:02.803
- You led them straight to us.

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:09.394
- They're breaking the hinges.

01:13:11.512 --> 01:13:13.264
(Mason): Fuck!

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:27.320
(Clang, screws dropping)

01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:41.835
(Wind whistling)

01:13:45.004 --> 01:13:47.302
(clanging)

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:49.141
- Behind us.

01:13:59.644 --> 01:14:02.238
(Clattering)

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:25.594
(Snarls)

01:14:32.802 --> 01:14:34.600
(whimpering)

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:38.728
(Woman screaming)

01:14:48.734 --> 01:14:51.283
(Clattering)

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:55.958
(Whispering): They're already inside.

01:14:56.075 --> 01:14:58.248
In the vents.

01:15:09.422 --> 01:15:10.639
- Oh...

01:15:11.632 --> 01:15:12.758
(Shrieks)

01:15:12.883 --> 01:15:14.100
- Mason!

01:15:28.482 --> 01:15:30.484
(Mason): Here they come!

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:34.956
(Feral man shrieking)

01:15:45.249 --> 01:15:47.047
- Fall back!

01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:50.092
- No! No more running!

01:15:53.966 --> 01:15:55.468
(Hisses)

01:16:15.696 --> 01:16:17.915
- Everybody in the main hall!

01:16:24.121 --> 01:16:25.668
(Screams)

01:16:44.308 --> 01:16:45.525
(Snarls)

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:51.907
(Feral men snarling)

01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:00.203
(Woman screaming)

01:17:00.324 --> 01:17:01.541
- I'm out.

01:17:01.659 --> 01:17:04.583
- We couldn't make it to the vault.
What the hell is going on out there?

01:17:04.703 --> 01:17:06.000
- They're inside.
They're everywhere.

01:17:08.374 --> 01:17:10.376
There's no time.

01:17:11.544 --> 01:17:13.012
(Kai): No! No!

01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:14.847
(Both): No!

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:17.058
- Let us in!
Let us in!

01:17:17.174 --> 01:17:18.221
- What are you doing?

01:17:18.342 --> 01:17:19.969
- I'm saving our lives.
- Oh!

01:17:20.094 --> 01:17:22.688
(Kai): Let us in!
(Mason): Open up!

01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:26.480
- Get back!
(Banging on door)

01:17:28.519 --> 01:17:29.862
(Kai): Mason!

01:17:31.605 --> 01:17:32.652
(Grunting)

01:17:34.191 --> 01:17:36.444
(Feral man snarling)

01:17:39.738 --> 01:17:41.331
(Gunfire)

01:17:47.288 --> 01:17:49.416
(Snarling)

01:17:52.918 --> 01:17:54.591
(Distant shouting)
- The doors!

01:17:59.175 --> 01:18:01.553
(Feral men shrieking)

01:18:05.472 --> 01:18:07.600
- You locked us out of here.

01:18:07.725 --> 01:18:10.399
- Yes.
- Fucking piece of shit!

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:12.442
- These doors are not gonna hold.

01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:16.609
- We need to get the fuck out of here!

01:18:18.068 --> 01:18:20.116
This leads to the surface.

01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:24.872
- You'll freeze,
if those things don't find you first.

01:18:24.992 --> 01:18:26.084
(Feral man roaring)

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:32.632
(Grunting)

01:18:39.673 --> 01:18:41.471
- It's our only chance!

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:44.853
- No, we stay.
Hold them off here.

01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:46.847
- Come on, let's go!
- We stay!

01:18:46.972 --> 01:18:48.849
- Just leave him.

01:18:50.351 --> 01:18:51.944
- Come on, come on!

01:18:52.061 --> 01:18:53.438
Let's go! Let's go!

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:54.984
Move. Come on!

01:18:56.857 --> 01:18:59.736
Let's go!
Come on, let's go!

01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:16.631
Nothing personal.

01:19:22.883 --> 01:19:25.557
You're gonna need every bullet.

01:19:51.495 --> 01:19:53.623
- Come and get it, motherfucker!

01:20:42.379 --> 01:20:43.426
(Clucking)

01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:08.322
(Roaring)

01:21:22.336 --> 01:21:24.213
- What do you want?

01:21:25.255 --> 01:21:27.758
- More.

01:21:38.352 --> 01:21:40.354
(Screaming)

01:22:15.389 --> 01:22:18.063
(Panting)

01:22:35.242 --> 01:22:38.667
(Screams, growling)

01:23:29.254 --> 01:23:32.007
- Kai, look.

01:23:32.132 --> 01:23:34.851
(Colonists coughing)

01:24:16.677 --> 01:24:18.395
(Coughing)

01:24:19.972 --> 01:24:21.224
_ Sam!

01:24:21.348 --> 01:24:23.225
Sam... Sam...

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:34.953
What do we do now?

01:24:42.202 --> 01:24:43.875
- We walk.

01:24:50.168 --> 01:24:52.170
With these...

01:24:53.797 --> 01:24:56.095
at least we have a chance.

01:24:59.011 --> 01:25:00.763
Now come on.

01:25:00.887 --> 01:25:02.730
Come on, let's go.

01:25:06.685 --> 01:25:09.689
We used to live and die
by the rules we made.

01:25:09.813 --> 01:25:11.565
Come on.

01:25:12.691 --> 01:25:15.865
But our rules,
like everything else we built...

01:25:17.237 --> 01:25:19.365
are breaking down.

01:25:21.366 --> 01:25:23.960
There's only one rule left now anyway,

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:26.629
one rule above all...

01:25:28.332 --> 01:25:30.676
survive.

01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:32.760
Come on.
