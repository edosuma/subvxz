WEBVTT

00:26.760 --> 00:29.497
* *

00:31.499 --> 00:33.201
I'd like to think that fate

00:33.401 --> 00:36.287
had a hand in what happened
that summer.

00:36.487 --> 00:39.699
That it was the pants' destiny
to find us.

00:39.899 --> 00:43.111
Where they came from
and why they chose us,

00:43.311 --> 00:46.514
well, that will always
be a mystery.

00:46.714 --> 00:49.317
But perhaps that was part
of their miracle,

00:49.517 --> 00:53.571
that they sensed in that moment
how much we needed them,

00:53.771 --> 00:57.825
how much we needed some little
bit of faith to hold on to,

00:58.025 --> 01:00.561
when it seemed like
everything we believed in

01:00.761 --> 01:03.631
was about to slip away.

01:03.831 --> 01:06.367
* *

01:12.806 --> 01:16.744
But wait a minute,
I'm getting ahead of myself.

01:16.944 --> 01:18.412
So that makes it...
Beautiful dress!

01:18.612 --> 01:20.881
We'd been a foursome for
as long as I could remember.

01:21.081 --> 01:21.982
Where are we going?

01:23.584 --> 01:26.720
In fact, we were a foursome
before we were born.

01:26.920 --> 01:27.588
And seven.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.223
Anyone feel any kicking?

01:29.423 --> 01:32.092
Our mothers met
at a prenatal aerobics class.

01:32.292 --> 01:34.962
They really didn't have
anything in common...

01:35.162 --> 01:37.565
except their due dates.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.733
One, and relax.

01:39.933 --> 01:40.768
Good work.

01:40.968 --> 01:43.704
The first one out of the gate
was Bridget.

01:43.904 --> 01:44.438
Uh-oh...

01:44.638 --> 01:46.574
Ladies, let's
keep it together.

01:46.774 --> 01:49.343
The rest of us followed
within the week.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.546
Bridget liked to take charge.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.649
Way to go, Lena!

01:55.849 --> 01:57.384
I'll handle this.

01:57.584 --> 01:58.919
And you know what?

01:59.119 --> 02:01.889
Sometimes that worked
in our favor.

02:02.089 --> 02:03.323
Ah! No!

02:03.523 --> 02:04.758
Oh, my God.

02:06.194 --> 02:07.595
Ah! Help!

02:07.795 --> 02:11.632
And that's how it always was
with us:

02:11.832 --> 02:13.367
give and take.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.771
But mostly give.

02:19.106 --> 02:22.292
Lena, I don't think
he's coming back this time.

02:22.492 --> 02:25.237
LENA
It's gonna be okay, Carmen.

02:25.437 --> 02:28.182
I'll come over
first thing tomorrow.

02:28.382 --> 02:31.319
And Tibby and Bridget, too.

02:31.519 --> 02:35.223
Just stay on the phone with me
until you fall asleep.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.560
What Were They Thinking?
take seven.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.662
We were there for each other,

02:41.862 --> 02:44.932
to understand the things that
no one else in the world could.

02:45.132 --> 02:46.000
What were they thinking?

02:46.200 --> 02:48.285
Having another baby
at their age!

02:48.485 --> 02:50.595
And what was I,
just some experiment

02:50.795 --> 02:52.906
from their hippie days
and now it's time

02:53.106 --> 02:55.243
to start their real family?

02:55.443 --> 02:57.045
Go ahead.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.713
They're out of their minds.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.532
It sucks.

03:01.732 --> 03:03.151
Totally.

03:03.351 --> 03:06.320
Cut! Lena, don't you realize
this is a tragedy?

03:06.520 --> 03:08.689
Can't you give me
a bit more enthusiasm?

03:08.889 --> 03:13.327
There were some things
we would never make sense of.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.363
Grief is never
an easy burden to bear.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.932
And we were there
for those, too.

03:18.132 --> 03:20.301
And as we mourn the loss

03:20.501 --> 03:22.970
of this beloved wife,
mother and friend,

03:23.170 --> 03:26.006
it only makes her choice
that much more unfathomable.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.376
What measure of despair

03:28.576 --> 03:31.345
compels one to commit
such an act?

03:31.545 --> 03:32.580
We can only take comfort

03:32.780 --> 03:36.083
in the fact that she is
in a better place now

03:36.283 --> 03:38.352
than she found here among us.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.959
My deepest sympathies.
Bridget.

03:46.159 --> 03:51.299
We were there for the things
we couldn't face alone.

03:51.499 --> 03:52.716
Hey.

03:52.916 --> 03:53.934
Hey, B,

03:54.134 --> 03:56.003
you okay?
Yeah. I will be

03:56.203 --> 03:59.440
as soon as I get out
of these stupid heels. Here.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.108
Hold them for me, will you?

04:01.308 --> 04:02.476
I think I'll run home.

04:03.911 --> 04:04.978
Or...

04:05.178 --> 04:08.115
the ones we didn't want
to face at all.

04:08.315 --> 04:11.018
* *

04:11.218 --> 04:15.689
Together it was as if we formed
one single, complete person:

04:15.889 --> 04:17.940
wild, unstoppable Bridget;

04:18.141 --> 04:20.192
shy and beautiful Lena;

04:20.392 --> 04:21.295
Tibby the rebel;

04:21.495 --> 04:24.598
and me, Carmen, the writer.

04:24.798 --> 04:27.034
You can't buy anything new
at a vintage store.

04:27.234 --> 04:29.303
We were 16
and had never been apart.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.572
And all that
was about to change.

04:31.772 --> 04:32.540
How about this one?

04:32.740 --> 04:34.475
It's great, if you
want to go to Greece

04:34.675 --> 04:35.976
looking like
Laverne De Fazio.

04:36.176 --> 04:37.111
Who?
'70s TV icon.

04:37.311 --> 04:39.847
Am I the only one who's not
culturally deprived around here?

04:40.047 --> 04:42.583
Oh, somebody forgot to take
her happy pill this morning.

04:42.783 --> 04:43.717
No. Actually,
I'm saving them up

04:43.917 --> 04:45.553
for when I'm stuck
doing time at Wallmans

04:45.753 --> 04:48.088
while the rest of you jet off
on your little adventures.

04:48.288 --> 04:51.592
Aw, boo-hoo, Tibby, you
are such a drama queen.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.494
I am going to
South Carolina.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.429
That is only, like,
three states away.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.897
It's abandonment,
nevertheless.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.031
I hate you all.

04:58.231 --> 05:00.968
Oh, please, you're the one who
wanted to stay here all summer

05:01.168 --> 05:02.803
and angst it out
making your documentary.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.338
Yeah, it's gonna be
a huge hit.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.940
Enthralling footage
on how to stack deodorant.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.543
You know, I think I'm gonna
start my own genre,

05:09.743 --> 05:11.111
call it the suck-umentary.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.180
Lena, look at this.
Oh, my goodness.

05:13.380 --> 05:14.215
They're perfect.

05:14.415 --> 05:15.549
I can't wear a bikini.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.618
Carmen, duh, don't you know
that all the beaches

05:17.818 --> 05:19.019
in Greece are nude? What?!

05:19.219 --> 05:21.155
She's just kidding, Lena.

05:21.355 --> 05:23.991
God, I envy you...
you get to go to a place

05:24.191 --> 05:25.125
where there's actually guys.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.794
I thought you were
looking forward

05:26.994 --> 05:28.295
to, um, el campo de futbol.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.397
She sure was

05:29.597 --> 05:31.331
until she found out
it was girls-only.

05:31.531 --> 05:32.166
No boys allowed.

05:32.366 --> 05:33.600
I don't want
to talk about it.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.218
Hey, pierce alert,
pierce alert.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.637
Mm-mm. Sorry, young lady.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.372
No more holes. I've told you...

05:38.572 --> 05:39.507
Tibby?

05:39.707 --> 05:41.575
Take those out right now
and try these on. Look.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.477
Put them on.
Go. Go, go, go, go.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.078
Carmen...

05:46.146 --> 05:46.980
* Ta-da! *

05:47.180 --> 05:48.549
Tibby, you're
a babe!

05:48.749 --> 05:51.318
Wow! Tibby,
you look amazing.

05:51.518 --> 05:52.152
Look at you!

05:52.352 --> 05:53.737
Turn around.
Carmen!

05:53.937 --> 05:55.322
You look wonderful.

05:55.522 --> 05:56.390
You look good!

05:56.590 --> 05:58.091
They look great on you.
Please buy them.

05:58.291 --> 05:59.676
You try them on, then.

05:59.876 --> 06:01.261
But I don't wear jeans.

06:01.461 --> 06:02.296
Yeah. Or bikinis

06:02.496 --> 06:03.664
or miniskirts
or anything else

06:03.864 --> 06:06.099
that might actually
show you have a shape.

06:06.299 --> 06:07.134
I do not.

06:07.334 --> 06:08.769
Tibby, those look
so great on you.

06:08.969 --> 06:09.970
Why can't you just admit it?

06:10.170 --> 06:13.373
Oh, because I'm
wallowing in self-pity.

06:15.242 --> 06:17.411
Ay, Dios mio!

06:17.611 --> 06:20.213
Lena... you have a body!
Are you serious?

06:20.413 --> 06:22.850
Lena Kaligaras
has a body!

06:23.050 --> 06:23.551
Shh. Stop it.

06:23.751 --> 06:24.918
When did this happen?

06:25.118 --> 06:26.286
You look good
in those!

06:26.486 --> 06:27.921
Look at you!

06:28.121 --> 06:29.990
You look good!
Little Lena.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.859
Bridget, you're the one

06:32.059 --> 06:34.194
who loves jeans so much,
why don't you try them?

06:34.394 --> 06:36.530
Uh, maybe 'cause I'm three
inches taller than you.

06:36.730 --> 06:37.731
Fair is fair.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.333
Hey, how can they be perfect
on you, too?

06:40.533 --> 06:41.334
Wow, that is
a little weird.

06:41.534 --> 06:42.403
I don't know, but, um,

06:42.603 --> 06:43.704
it's really starting
to freak me out.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.472
Okay, Carmen,
it's your turn.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.390
* Ooh, woo, ooh... *

06:47.590 --> 06:49.309
Carmen, you try them on.

06:49.509 --> 06:50.210
You have to.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.145
Oh, come on, B, honestly.

06:52.345 --> 06:53.414
Are you serious?

06:53.614 --> 06:55.215
You think that a pair of jeans
that fits all three of you

06:55.415 --> 06:57.417
is going to fit...
all of this?

06:57.617 --> 06:58.486
Put them on. Now.

06:58.686 --> 06:59.753
We'll help your thighs
get into them.

06:59.953 --> 07:00.954
Don't worry about it.

07:01.154 --> 07:01.755
Tibby!

07:01.955 --> 07:02.623
Oh, come on.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.575
Will you help me
get out of them?

07:04.775 --> 07:06.527
Carmen, we all
tried them on.

07:06.727 --> 07:07.328
Yeah.

07:07.528 --> 07:08.512
Just try them.

07:08.712 --> 07:09.697
All right.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.801
My thighs.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.870
Sassy britches.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.009
Okay, here we go.

07:26.179 --> 07:27.114
What?

07:27.314 --> 07:28.416
I told you guys,
I'm just gonna

07:28.616 --> 07:30.951
take them off,
and we're gonna pretend

07:31.151 --> 07:31.752
like this never...

07:33.020 --> 07:34.187
Come over here and
look at yourself.

07:34.387 --> 07:35.188
They look amazing on you.

07:35.388 --> 07:36.757
Look at them.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.661
Call me crazy, but it's
scientifically impossible

07:40.861 --> 07:42.796
that a pair of pants
could fit me...

07:42.996 --> 07:44.698
And me... And me...

07:44.898 --> 07:46.400
And me.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.768
This is crazy.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.069
Look, Tib, something
happened today

07:49.269 --> 07:51.204
that I can't explain
and you can't explain.

07:51.404 --> 07:52.606
Okay, whatever,
let's just ignore it.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.075
We can't just ignore...
we can't just ignore it.

07:55.275 --> 07:55.876
Why?

07:56.076 --> 07:57.077
Because it's a sign...

07:57.277 --> 07:58.078
Shh. Be quiet.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.247
Sometimes you
are just...

08:00.447 --> 08:01.298
B, be careful!

08:01.498 --> 08:02.641
I'm fine, Lena.

08:02.841 --> 08:03.784
Oh, my God.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.586
All I know is, it makes every
one of our butts look good.

08:05.786 --> 08:06.587
That's enough for me.

08:06.787 --> 08:07.788
That's right.

08:07.988 --> 08:08.389
Amen.

08:08.589 --> 08:09.690
Get up there. Go on.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.759
Look, there is more going on
here than, like...

08:11.959 --> 08:13.226
But there's
probably Lycra.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.871
All right, guys,
are we ready for this?

08:25.071 --> 08:27.040
In the name of the Father,
the Son...

08:27.240 --> 08:28.208
Oh, my God,
here we go.

08:28.408 --> 08:29.410
Oh, Carmen.
This isn't church!

08:29.610 --> 08:32.446
You guys! But it's still
a sacred place.

08:32.645 --> 08:35.097
I mean, this is where
our moms met, right?

08:35.298 --> 08:37.525
Anyway, look,
we're gathered here today

08:37.725 --> 08:39.953
to honor a gift
that has been sent to us.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.589
Then why'd we have
to pay for 'em?

08:41.789 --> 08:43.256
Tibby, just go with it.

08:43.456 --> 08:44.424
Carmen, go ahead.

08:44.624 --> 08:45.526
I know.

08:45.726 --> 08:48.545
Tonight, on the eve
of our separation,

08:48.745 --> 08:51.565
magic has come to us
in a pair of pants.

08:53.801 --> 08:56.136
What? And I'm proposing

08:56.336 --> 08:58.472
that we share them equally,

08:58.672 --> 09:01.274
and that this summer
they travel among us,

09:01.474 --> 09:04.010
and they'll link us
in hearts and spirits,

09:04.210 --> 09:06.747
even though we're far apart
from each other.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.382
That's sweet.
I think that tonight

09:08.582 --> 09:10.017
we're the sisters
of these pantalones.

09:10.217 --> 09:10.618
Yes!

09:10.818 --> 09:11.952
Sisters of the Pants?

09:12.152 --> 09:13.086
Yes!
We need rules.

09:13.286 --> 09:14.688
Every sisterhood
has rules.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.223
Thank you. A manifesto.

09:16.423 --> 09:17.057
Okay.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.358
Good point! I love it!

09:18.558 --> 09:19.460
Okay, rule number one.

09:19.660 --> 09:22.029
Um, each sister is going
to keep the pants for...

09:22.229 --> 09:23.631
A week. A week.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.565
I think that Lena
should be first, 'cause Greece

09:25.765 --> 09:26.566
is the furthest away.

09:26.766 --> 09:27.735
Yes.
Okay.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.436
Tibby, you next.
Uh, what's your rule?

09:29.636 --> 09:30.837
I don't have a rule.

09:31.037 --> 09:32.039
Yes, you do.
Come on.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.974
Uh, no picking your nose
when wearing the pants.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.375
Honestly!
That's not...

09:35.575 --> 09:37.627
Well, you can
casually scratch

09:37.827 --> 09:39.880
while really...
picking, a little.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.815
Thanks for the allowance.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.250
Okay, when sending the pants,

09:43.450 --> 09:44.985
we should write a letter
that details

09:45.185 --> 09:46.720
the most exciting thing
that happened to you

09:46.920 --> 09:48.071
while wearing the pants.

09:48.271 --> 09:49.222
That's a good rule.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.124
So the most exciting thing
that happens to you.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.826
And what if nothing
exciting happens?

09:53.026 --> 09:54.127
Something exciting
is gonna have to.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.228
No, I really doubt it.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.129
Oh, and when

09:56.329 --> 09:58.131
it happens,
and we reunite,

09:58.331 --> 09:59.166
we will document it

09:59.366 --> 10:00.834
on the pants themselves.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.302
That's good.

10:02.502 --> 10:03.737
That's rule number six.

10:03.937 --> 10:04.538
Rule number seven.

10:04.738 --> 10:05.839
Any removal of the pants

10:06.039 --> 10:08.876
must be done
by the wearer herself.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.544
Yes, you.

10:12.646 --> 10:13.897
TouchÃ©.
TouchÃ©.

10:14.097 --> 10:15.148
He works, you know.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.750
So he may not have that much
time to spend with you.

10:17.950 --> 10:20.353
So if you get lonely, I want
you to come home, okay?

10:20.553 --> 10:21.922
I'm gonna be fine, Mom.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.807
We will never, ever

10:24.007 --> 10:25.493
wash these pants.

10:25.693 --> 10:27.661
Ew, Carmen, that's
so unnecessary. Why not?

10:27.861 --> 10:29.229
Because you can't
wash the pants.

10:29.429 --> 10:30.063
Why?

10:30.263 --> 10:31.799
Carmen, we have
to wash the pants.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.834
What, are you gonna wash
the magic out of the pants?

10:34.034 --> 10:35.085
That is not sanitary.

10:35.285 --> 10:36.136
No, better one...

10:36.336 --> 10:38.005
I have a better one:
no double cuffing.

10:38.205 --> 10:40.573
Double cuffing the pants
at the bottom... it's tacky.

10:40.773 --> 10:41.642
It's totally tacky.

10:41.842 --> 10:42.893
You know what else is tacky?

10:43.093 --> 10:43.944
Uh, tucking in your shirt

10:44.144 --> 10:45.378
and wearing a belt
at the same time.

10:45.578 --> 10:46.547
Oh! That's a good one!

10:46.747 --> 10:48.382
I don't do that anymore.

10:48.582 --> 10:50.217
I did that one time.

10:51.919 --> 10:54.554
No cuffs, no tucking.

10:56.589 --> 10:57.891
Okay, yes, B?

10:58.091 --> 11:00.160
You can never say you look fat
while wearing the pants.

11:00.360 --> 11:00.761
Ouch! Ow...

11:00.961 --> 11:02.896
You can't even think it!

11:04.264 --> 11:05.899
And, uh, take care.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.401
And... be sure
to write, huh?

11:08.601 --> 11:10.604
You, too. Bye.

11:10.804 --> 11:11.872
You better get going.

11:12.072 --> 11:15.008
Looks like they're
starting to board.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.278
That's nine.

11:18.478 --> 11:19.496
We need one more.

11:19.696 --> 11:20.714
We need a final rule.

11:20.914 --> 11:21.682
Final rule.

11:21.882 --> 11:24.484
Okay, pants equal love.

11:24.684 --> 11:28.288
Love your sisters
and love yourself.

11:41.601 --> 11:43.503
To the pants.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.238
And the sisterhood.

11:45.438 --> 11:46.774
And this summer.

11:46.974 --> 11:49.442
And the rest of our lives.

11:49.642 --> 11:52.312
Together and apart.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.935
* *

12:17.470 --> 12:22.242
You know, Papou,
I really wouldn't mind walking.

12:23.110 --> 12:27.180
I'm sorry that my...
my Greek isn't so good.

12:27.380 --> 12:28.982
Um...

12:29.182 --> 12:31.284
Mom said that I'd pick it up
in no time.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.586
You know, with all the...
the talking,

12:33.786 --> 12:36.990
just with you and with Yia Yia.

12:38.892 --> 12:41.228
* *

13:02.715 --> 13:05.518
* *

13:31.411 --> 13:33.013
Lena!

13:40.587 --> 13:42.022
Lena!

13:42.222 --> 13:44.124
Puh-puh-puh-
puh-puh-puh. Oh, uh...

13:44.324 --> 13:45.292
It's the evil eye. Oh.

13:45.492 --> 13:50.998
Oh, Lena, I think I'll die
and never see my Lena!

13:51.198 --> 13:54.001
I think I'll never
see you, my Lena.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.007
You like your room?

14:01.207 --> 14:02.442
Eh? And your bed?

14:02.642 --> 14:05.478
I have put the most special
sheets and lace.

14:05.678 --> 14:10.350
And from this window,
the most beautiful view, eh?

14:13.686 --> 14:16.622
She's special, eh?
Like a jewel.

14:16.822 --> 14:19.759
Ah, we guard you
like a jewel. Eh?

14:22.462 --> 14:24.797
You need rest, eh?
Good rest.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.085
* Para bailar La Bamba *

14:45.285 --> 14:49.072
* Se necesita una poca
de gracia *

14:49.272 --> 14:53.060
* Una poca de gracia
por mi y por ti *

14:53.260 --> 14:55.495
* Y arriba y arriba... *

15:06.573 --> 15:08.741
* *

15:21.588 --> 15:24.257
When you hear your name called
and the color of your team,

15:24.457 --> 15:26.726
run over and join your coach.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.261
Alber, Megan, green.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.131
Anderson, Alice, green.

15:39.339 --> 15:40.407
Please, God,

15:40.607 --> 15:42.942
let me sprain my ankle
as soon as possible.

15:43.142 --> 15:44.044
Come again?

15:44.244 --> 15:45.695
This whole thing was
my mother's idea.

15:45.895 --> 15:47.422
She couldn't wait
to get rid of me.

15:47.622 --> 15:48.949
God, mine has been
sobbing all week.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.284
"I don't know what
I'm gonna do without you."

15:51.484 --> 15:53.120
I'm like, "Get a life, Ma,"
you know?

15:53.320 --> 15:55.172
What's yours do?

15:55.372 --> 15:57.224
Oh, um, nothing.

15:58.725 --> 15:59.993
Hey, who's that?

16:00.193 --> 16:02.629
Don't even think
about it.

16:02.829 --> 16:05.132
It's against the rules
to have flings with the coaches.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.167
Darcet, Olivia! Red!

16:08.701 --> 16:09.969
Come on!

16:10.637 --> 16:13.840
Vreeland, Bridget! Red!

16:15.742 --> 16:19.646
* *

16:30.390 --> 16:32.826
* I could feel you *

16:33.026 --> 16:35.612
* You were there *

16:35.812 --> 16:38.873
* I could hold you *

16:39.073 --> 16:42.135
* But you're not there *

16:42.335 --> 16:44.604
* I *

16:44.804 --> 16:47.174
* I'm going away *

16:47.374 --> 16:51.544
* I'm going away *
Hey, baby.

16:51.744 --> 16:52.612
* I just *

16:52.812 --> 16:56.116
* Want you to know... *

16:56.316 --> 16:57.184
Here it is.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.486
I asked the school to
postpone sending this

16:59.686 --> 17:01.788
because, Dad, I wanted
to surprise you.

17:01.988 --> 17:03.123
* Ta-da! *
Straight A's.

17:03.323 --> 17:04.156
That's fantastic!

17:04.357 --> 17:05.858
Dad, I brought
my tennis gear,

17:06.059 --> 17:07.460
and I have been practicing
like crazy,

17:07.660 --> 17:10.530
so I want you to serve to me
your absolute hardest, okay?

17:10.730 --> 17:11.397
I'll do that.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.833
You know, I was
calculating it on the train.

17:14.032 --> 17:15.202
I haven't spent

17:15.402 --> 17:17.637
more than four straight days
with you since I was ten.

17:17.837 --> 17:20.107
I mean, I love it
when you come for Christmas,

17:20.307 --> 17:21.574
but a whole summer?

17:21.773 --> 17:22.842
Just the two of us?

17:23.041 --> 17:26.213
Did I tell you that Mom taught
me how to make arroz con pollo?

17:26.413 --> 17:27.946
I'm gonna cook that
for you.

17:28.146 --> 17:29.899
And platanos, too.

17:30.099 --> 17:31.851
Wait, where are we?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.320
* *

17:33.520 --> 17:35.522
I have a surprise
for you.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.508
I moved out of Charleston.

17:38.708 --> 17:39.960
And into a development?

17:40.160 --> 17:43.130
Dad...
but you hate developments.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.531
When did I say that?

17:44.731 --> 17:47.434
At the Frederick Law Olmsted
exhibit at the Smithsonian.

17:47.634 --> 17:50.403
You said there's city
and there's country,

17:50.603 --> 17:52.339
and everything else
is a wasteland.

17:52.539 --> 17:55.208
I was nine years old,
and you came to DC for one day

17:55.408 --> 17:56.976
to visit with
a plastics company.

17:57.176 --> 17:58.545
You remember everything.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.947
I don't remember
you telling me you moved.

18:01.147 --> 18:03.283
* *

18:06.253 --> 18:08.188
Who is that?!

18:08.388 --> 18:09.956
Is that your neighbor?

18:10.156 --> 18:11.624
Actually...

18:11.824 --> 18:13.426
we live together.

18:16.129 --> 18:18.131
Hey!

18:21.434 --> 18:26.473
You must be Carmen.

18:26.673 --> 18:27.707
Ooh.

18:29.376 --> 18:31.511
Your daddy has told me
so much about you.

18:31.711 --> 18:32.912
I just know
we're gonna have

18:33.112 --> 18:35.515
the most wonderful
summer together.

18:35.715 --> 18:36.949
Kids! Kids,
come on out here!

18:37.149 --> 18:37.750
Kids?

18:37.950 --> 18:38.818
They're not kids.

18:39.018 --> 18:41.020
They're teenagers,
just like you.

18:41.220 --> 18:42.822
They live with you?

18:43.022 --> 18:44.057
Carmen...

18:44.257 --> 18:46.209
this is Krista,
and this is Paul.

18:46.409 --> 18:48.361
We're gonna be
bridesmaids together.

18:48.561 --> 18:49.229
Excuse me?!

18:49.429 --> 18:51.431
I... hadn't quite gotten

18:51.631 --> 18:53.032
to that part of
the surprise yet.

18:53.232 --> 18:54.001
Sweetheart?

18:54.201 --> 18:56.303
Oh, sweetheart,
I...

18:56.503 --> 18:58.605
We're getting married.

18:59.806 --> 19:03.075
August 19.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.837
Say, you're a real
natural with that thing.

19:14.037 --> 19:16.631
Took me weeks before
I got the hang of it.

19:16.831 --> 19:19.426
Yeah, well, we all have
our special talents.

19:19.626 --> 19:20.493
Tibby.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.745
I thought I made it
perfectly clear

19:22.945 --> 19:24.997
that employee headsets
are to be worn

19:25.197 --> 19:26.099
at all times.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.568
Don't make me mention it again.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.803
Excuse me?

19:31.003 --> 19:35.242
Where are the shampoos?

19:35.442 --> 19:37.410
Aisle seven.

20:01.067 --> 20:02.835
Oh, my God.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.440
Somebody help.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.176
Girl down.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.811
Somebody call an ambulance!

20:26.959 --> 20:30.430
You got a price sticker
on your forehead.

21:03.296 --> 21:08.435
* *

21:17.777 --> 21:22.415
* *

21:34.894 --> 21:38.931
* *

21:56.215 --> 21:57.450
I'm sorry, I...

21:57.650 --> 22:00.520
I don't speak
Greek very well.

22:00.720 --> 22:04.524
Well, we'll have to work
on that, won't we?

22:10.162 --> 22:12.565
Thanks for lending me a shirt.

22:12.765 --> 22:15.034
It looks
good on you.

22:16.603 --> 22:19.939
Sorry if it
smells like fish.

22:22.241 --> 22:23.876
Is this your boat?

22:24.076 --> 22:25.277
My grandfather's. Yeah.

22:25.477 --> 22:26.279
Mm.

22:26.479 --> 22:27.414
All the ones
with the blue flags

22:27.614 --> 22:28.281
are his.

22:28.481 --> 22:29.866
Do you work for him?

22:30.066 --> 22:31.251
No, just in the summer.

22:31.451 --> 22:33.420
I go to the university
in Athens.

22:37.390 --> 22:38.841
Kostas Dunas.

22:39.041 --> 22:41.528
Lena Kaligaras.

22:41.728 --> 22:42.995
Then you are
Greek, too, eh?

22:43.195 --> 22:44.063
Mm-hmm.

22:44.263 --> 22:45.714
So how do you, uh,

22:45.914 --> 22:47.166
know English so well?

22:47.366 --> 22:50.336
Well, I lived with
my parents in Chicago

22:50.536 --> 22:51.471
until I was 12.

22:51.671 --> 22:53.840
Oh, my parents moved
to the U.S., too.

22:54.040 --> 22:54.674
Yeah.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.709
But I'm just here
for the summer.

22:56.909 --> 22:59.111
I'm staying with
my grandparents.

22:59.311 --> 23:01.514
I have to throw
the small ones back.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.483
Would you like to help?

23:03.683 --> 23:06.052
Um... no.

23:06.252 --> 23:07.654
That's okay. No.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.956
Okay, here.
I'll show you.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.092
Give me your hand.

23:13.292 --> 23:14.261
Uh... um...

23:14.461 --> 23:16.496
Put your hand
on my hand.

23:20.032 --> 23:22.134
Good? Mm-hmm.

23:22.334 --> 23:23.836
There.

23:25.805 --> 23:28.508
Luck was on his side today.

23:33.379 --> 23:36.416
I have to go. I should go.

23:36.616 --> 23:40.887
But, uh, thank you, again,
for saving my life.

23:44.724 --> 23:46.893
Do you dance better
than you swim?

23:47.093 --> 23:47.927
Uh...

23:48.127 --> 23:49.061
Excuse me?

23:49.261 --> 23:50.329
Saturday night.

23:50.529 --> 23:52.365
Meet me.

23:52.565 --> 23:55.868
Uh, I'm sorry, I ca...
I can't.

24:05.678 --> 24:09.516
Pick it up!

24:10.583 --> 24:12.852
* I am unwritten *

24:13.052 --> 24:15.321
* Can't read my mind *

24:15.521 --> 24:18.725
* I'm undefined *

24:18.925 --> 24:21.427
* I'm just beginning... *

24:21.627 --> 24:24.130
Hi.

24:24.330 --> 24:25.932
I'm Bridget.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.533
Eric.

24:27.733 --> 24:28.935
I know.

24:29.135 --> 24:32.939
So, um, I hear you
go to Columbia.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.942
Yep.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.144
Well, what have you
heard about me?

24:38.344 --> 24:40.346
Your high school
won Nationals.

24:40.546 --> 24:43.365
MVP. I play forward.

24:43.565 --> 24:46.385
So I've noticed.

24:46.585 --> 24:49.822
I'm 17.

24:51.357 --> 24:52.692
Come on,
I'll race you.

24:52.892 --> 24:55.895
* No one else
can feel it for you *

24:56.095 --> 24:58.230
* Only you can let it in *

24:58.430 --> 25:03.235
* No one else, no one else can
speak the words on your lips *

25:03.435 --> 25:06.005
* Today is where
your book begins *

25:06.205 --> 25:09.308
* The rest is still unwritten *

25:09.508 --> 25:12.444
* Yeah. *

25:14.513 --> 25:16.365
That's it.

25:16.565 --> 25:18.217
Seven miles.

25:18.417 --> 25:21.921
Oh, God,
don't you love to run?

25:22.121 --> 25:22.589
Yeah.

25:22.789 --> 25:25.592
It's the best high there is.

25:25.792 --> 25:26.793
Exactly.

25:26.993 --> 25:29.178
It's-It's... It's like
you're just in this place

25:29.378 --> 25:31.564
where-where nothing bad
can ever happen, you know?

25:31.764 --> 25:32.799
Like,
if you just

25:32.999 --> 25:35.602
push a bit further,
if you just keep moving...

25:35.802 --> 25:38.104
Nothing can touch you.

25:39.071 --> 25:40.406
Of course,
the endorphins

25:40.606 --> 25:42.474
don't suck either.

25:47.546 --> 25:48.781
So Tammy's feeling okay?

25:48.981 --> 25:50.016
Yeah.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.084
So is she going to do
baton twirling with you?

25:52.284 --> 25:52.885
We don't know yet.

25:53.085 --> 25:54.887
She might just have
to hold the banner.

25:55.087 --> 25:56.823
Sweetheart,
why don't we say grace

25:57.023 --> 25:58.691
before we start eating dinner.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.226
I would love to.

26:02.962 --> 26:04.831
Bless us, O Lord,
for these, Thy gifts,

26:05.031 --> 26:05.998
which we are about to receive,

26:06.198 --> 26:09.501
from Thy bounty, through
Christ our Lord...

26:09.701 --> 26:10.737
Amen.

26:10.937 --> 26:11.938
Dig in. This looks great.

26:13.139 --> 26:14.040
I will get that.

26:14.240 --> 26:14.941
Oh, it's okay.

26:15.141 --> 26:17.043
We don't answer
the phone during dinner.

26:17.243 --> 26:18.578
Except that one time.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.379
Tell us again
how you guys met.

26:20.579 --> 26:21.313
Oh...

26:21.513 --> 26:22.882
We've told that
story so many times.

26:23.082 --> 26:23.816
Do you want to tell it?

26:24.016 --> 26:25.117
No, I don't want to tell it.

26:25.317 --> 26:26.518
You want me to tell it?
All right.

26:26.718 --> 26:27.453
I dialed the wrong number...

26:27.653 --> 26:28.971
And I answered.

26:29.171 --> 26:30.289
During dinner.

26:30.489 --> 26:31.557
Just that one time.

26:31.757 --> 26:32.625
And Lydia agreed

26:32.825 --> 26:34.610
to go out
with a perfect stranger.

26:34.810 --> 26:36.595
Is that how it happened?
Oh, no.

26:36.795 --> 26:38.264
Come on.
No, no, no.

26:38.464 --> 26:39.398
That is exactly what happened.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.934
We went bowling.
It was so much fun.

26:42.134 --> 26:44.470
Do you remember?
You bowled a two.

26:44.670 --> 26:45.838
A two is a bad score.

26:46.038 --> 26:47.273
At least I didn't get the
bowling ball stuck on my thumb.

26:47.473 --> 26:49.308
The water in the toilet is blue.

26:49.508 --> 26:50.142
Blue?

26:50.342 --> 26:51.444
Yes, Mom, blue.

26:51.644 --> 26:53.746
And by the way,
doesn't Dad hate bowling?

26:53.946 --> 26:54.581
Bowling?

26:54.781 --> 26:55.815
Well, he's down here bowling.

26:56.015 --> 26:57.950
And he says grace.

26:58.150 --> 26:58.618
Grace?!

26:58.818 --> 26:59.952
He says Grace, Mom.

27:00.152 --> 27:01.588
Like, he gives thanks
to God before he eats.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.790
We couldn't get him to go
to church with us once.

27:03.990 --> 27:04.891
Who is this guy?
I don't even...

27:05.091 --> 27:06.959
Okay, you need
to talk to him, Carmen.

27:07.159 --> 27:08.961
Just...
tell him how you feel.

27:09.161 --> 27:10.446
I do. I do talk to him.

27:10.646 --> 27:12.189
I talk to him all the time.

27:12.389 --> 27:14.045
Yeah, like you talk to me? No.

27:14.245 --> 27:15.902
This is important Carmensita.

27:16.102 --> 27:17.303
What he did was wrong.

27:17.503 --> 27:19.739
I'm gonna get on a plane and
I'm just gonna come down there.

27:19.939 --> 27:20.873
No, Mom, look...

27:21.073 --> 27:23.142
Okay, you'd never
want him to be happy,

27:23.342 --> 27:24.611
and that's why you blame him

27:24.811 --> 27:26.713
and this
is gonna work out great.

27:26.913 --> 27:27.947
It's going to be fine.

27:38.758 --> 27:42.328
Dear Tibby,
I think we may have been

27:42.528 --> 27:45.898
very, very wrong
about the pants.

27:46.098 --> 27:48.934
The one time I wore them,
I almost drowned,

27:49.134 --> 27:51.887
and then got plucked
onto a fishing boat

27:52.087 --> 27:54.841
by a guy who made me
touch a live fish.

27:55.041 --> 27:56.175
It was disgusting.

27:56.375 --> 27:59.045
At least I'm getting
some good sketching in.

27:59.245 --> 28:02.731
I love everything
about this island.

28:02.931 --> 28:06.418
Well, except
that you're not with me.

28:06.618 --> 28:10.156
Infinite X's and O's.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.958
Lena.

28:27.439 --> 28:28.808
How was town?

28:29.008 --> 28:29.842
Fine.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.211
I have found this
in the laundry.

28:32.411 --> 28:34.346
Is it yours?

28:34.546 --> 28:35.815
No, actually, um...

28:37.449 --> 28:38.850
I, uh, I sort of

28:39.050 --> 28:40.252
borrowed it.

28:40.452 --> 28:42.071
When I went down
to the, um,

28:42.271 --> 28:43.690
harbor,
I went swimming,

28:43.890 --> 28:45.624
and someone just lent it to me.

28:45.824 --> 28:47.559
Oh, someone.
Someone who?

28:47.759 --> 28:48.960
A boy, yeah?

28:49.160 --> 28:50.162
Which one?

28:50.362 --> 28:51.430
I know everyone.

28:55.001 --> 28:57.169
Don't mind them,
they're your cousins.

29:00.139 --> 29:02.474
They're cousins, too?
How many do I have?

29:02.674 --> 29:03.542
Plenty of them.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.945
Don't change the subject.

29:06.145 --> 29:09.381
Come, out with it.

29:09.581 --> 29:10.382
Out, out.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.618
His name is Kostas Dunas.

29:15.721 --> 29:17.389
Dunas?

29:18.657 --> 29:19.792
He's a Dunas?!

29:20.860 --> 29:22.161
Shh!

29:22.361 --> 29:24.830
You must never
speak of them.

29:25.030 --> 29:27.499
They are liars,
they are thieves,

29:27.699 --> 29:28.634
they are barbarians!

29:36.442 --> 29:41.513
Your grandfather would die
if he know about this.

29:41.713 --> 29:45.784
You must never see
this boy again.

29:45.984 --> 29:47.253
You understand?

29:47.453 --> 29:48.621
Yes.

29:48.821 --> 29:51.640
No, that's not enough.

29:51.840 --> 29:54.660
You have to swear.

29:54.860 --> 29:56.562
I swear.

29:58.230 --> 29:59.999
Okay.

30:14.013 --> 30:18.384
* *

30:27.259 --> 30:31.230
* *

30:41.507 --> 30:47.213
* *

30:47.413 --> 30:49.081
What exactly am I supposed
to be saying here?

30:49.281 --> 30:50.966
TIBBY
Oh, just stuff about your life.

30:51.166 --> 30:52.676
Oh, ain't nothing
too interesting.

30:52.876 --> 30:54.186
Well, we're not really looking

30:54.386 --> 30:56.021
for interesting,
just real, you know.

30:56.221 --> 30:57.856
That's the point
of a documentary.

30:58.056 --> 30:58.791
A what?

30:58.991 --> 31:01.360
A documentary.

31:01.560 --> 31:02.862
Oh.

31:03.062 --> 31:05.597
Like a movie,
only boring.

31:13.805 --> 31:15.207
Um, hi.
I think this is yours.

31:15.407 --> 31:17.693
They delivered it
to my house by mistake.

31:17.893 --> 31:20.179
They must have got
the numbers screwed up.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.014
See, this says 721 and I'm 271.

31:22.214 --> 31:22.815
I'm Bailey.

31:23.015 --> 31:24.083
Yeah, you're the one...

31:24.283 --> 31:26.152
that, um, that fainted
the other day, right?

31:26.352 --> 31:27.686
At Wallmans. I was there.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.188
Oh, yeah.

31:29.388 --> 31:33.025
You're the weird girl with the
price sticker on your forehead.

31:33.225 --> 31:36.362
Wait here,
I got something for you.

31:47.806 --> 31:50.309
It was lying
next to you.

31:50.509 --> 31:52.311
I opened it up to see if
there was an I.D. in it.

31:52.511 --> 31:53.545
So you ripped off
my wallet?

31:53.745 --> 31:54.613
Ooh...

31:54.813 --> 31:58.284
that's kind of like a
thank you, but different?

31:59.385 --> 32:01.587
I think I had more than
four dollars in here.

32:01.787 --> 32:05.124
Do you seriously think
I would steal your money?

32:07.126 --> 32:08.860
I opened it to see
if there was an I.D. in there.

32:09.060 --> 32:10.262
Okay? There wasn't.

32:10.462 --> 32:13.032
There was a school photo and
a pathetic picture of a kitten.

32:13.232 --> 32:14.333
Oh, so what's in yours?

32:14.533 --> 32:17.569
A Wallmans employee card
or license to ride a bike?

32:17.769 --> 32:18.537
Oh, excuse me.

32:18.737 --> 32:20.339
I get my learner's permit
next week and...

32:20.539 --> 32:21.807
How old are you, like, ten?

32:22.007 --> 32:22.641
Twelve.
Whatever.

32:22.841 --> 32:23.810
Same difference.
No, it's not.

32:24.010 --> 32:25.677
When I was ten,
I didn't have an iPod.

32:25.877 --> 32:26.712
Oh, you're so cool.

32:26.912 --> 32:28.047
And what are you
listening to in there?

32:28.247 --> 32:29.048
Teletubbies' Hit Parade?

32:30.216 --> 32:32.251
You woke her up.
Thank you.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.557
Must suck.

32:38.757 --> 32:39.959
What?

32:40.159 --> 32:42.011
Having to baby-sit
on your day off.

32:42.211 --> 32:44.063
Why are you
working there anyway?

32:44.263 --> 32:45.464
It just
so happens

32:45.664 --> 32:48.350
that I need some extra money
for new video equipment,

32:48.550 --> 32:51.237
and when I finally got around
to looking for a new job,

32:51.437 --> 32:52.038
Wallmans was the...

32:52.238 --> 32:53.305
Why am I telling you this?

32:53.505 --> 32:54.873
Don't you have somewhere
you need to be?

32:55.073 --> 32:57.376
Not really.

32:59.045 --> 33:00.846
Looks like
you got a lot already.

33:01.046 --> 33:02.848
Are you making
a movie or something?

33:03.048 --> 33:04.050
More like an ode.

33:04.950 --> 33:06.118
To what?

33:06.318 --> 33:08.487
Lives of quiet desperation.

33:08.687 --> 33:10.856
Human existence at its lamest.

33:11.056 --> 33:12.124
Oh, fascinating.

33:12.324 --> 33:13.926
Maybe you need an assistant.

33:14.126 --> 33:15.594
Maybe I don't.
You wouldn't have

33:15.794 --> 33:16.528
to pay me or anything.

33:16.728 --> 33:18.730
I could just help you carry
equipment and stuff.

33:18.930 --> 33:20.532
Hi, honey.

33:20.732 --> 33:21.767
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.

33:22.768 --> 33:24.070
Who's your friend?

33:24.870 --> 33:25.938
She's not my...

33:26.138 --> 33:27.273
Bailey. Bailey Graffman.

33:27.473 --> 33:29.842
Well, I got to go.

33:30.042 --> 33:32.411
See you around, Tibby.

33:42.788 --> 33:44.090
There you are.

33:51.097 --> 33:53.299
Hi. Hey.

33:54.533 --> 33:57.103
We should play
tennis tomorrow.

33:57.303 --> 33:57.904
Really?

33:58.104 --> 33:59.105
Yeah.
Yeah.

33:59.305 --> 34:00.372
In the morning?
Yeah.

34:00.572 --> 34:01.941
Are you ready for this,
old man?

34:02.141 --> 34:03.375
You think your knees,
your knees can take it?

34:03.575 --> 34:04.576
Seriously, do you
actually think

34:04.776 --> 34:05.777
that you can return my serve?

34:05.977 --> 34:06.946
I do, Dad, I do.

34:07.146 --> 34:08.114
Would you like to put
some money on that?

34:08.313 --> 34:09.081
I'll put some money
on it.

34:09.281 --> 34:10.216
Uh, sweetheart?
Yeah?

34:10.416 --> 34:12.117
I got to meet
the caterers at the hotel.

34:12.317 --> 34:14.018
Would you mind
stopping by Paul's game?

34:14.219 --> 34:14.620
Sure.

34:14.820 --> 34:16.655
He's an unbelievable

34:16.855 --> 34:17.656
soccer player.

34:17.856 --> 34:18.524
Mm-hmm.

34:18.724 --> 34:21.393
We'll just stop
for one second, okay?

34:21.592 --> 34:22.860
It's right on the way.

34:23.061 --> 34:23.895
Yeah, yeah, okay.

34:28.534 --> 34:31.536
* *

34:43.748 --> 34:44.783
Oh, hey.

34:44.983 --> 34:46.016
How are you?

34:46.217 --> 34:47.286
Good.

34:47.485 --> 34:49.221
Didn't think your team was
scrimmaging till later today.

34:49.420 --> 34:50.956
They're not,
I just came out early

34:51.156 --> 34:52.524
to check out the competition.

34:52.724 --> 34:53.759
Oh...

34:53.958 --> 34:56.728
Well, you're
looking at her.

34:57.696 --> 35:01.167
You're awfully
sure of yourself, huh?

35:01.367 --> 35:03.235
When I know what I want.

35:09.141 --> 35:11.977
Take it down! Take it down!

35:16.848 --> 35:17.916
Overtime!

35:18.116 --> 35:19.217
All right!

35:19.417 --> 35:20.319
Overtime.

35:20.519 --> 35:22.087
Which one of
those is yours?

35:22.287 --> 35:23.922
Uh, Paul. Paul Rodman.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.258
Oh, so you're the
golden boy's dad.

35:26.458 --> 35:27.259
He's a good player.

35:27.459 --> 35:28.460
Yeah, he is.

35:28.660 --> 35:29.461
Al?!

35:49.381 --> 35:51.350
Okay, let's see you pass!

35:51.550 --> 35:54.620
Pass, Vreeland!

35:54.820 --> 35:55.787
Now!

36:02.294 --> 36:03.829
Yep, nice shot.

36:04.029 --> 36:06.832
We're not worthy.

36:07.032 --> 36:08.033
Come on, ladies!

36:08.233 --> 36:09.668
Sub!

36:09.868 --> 36:10.936
Vreeland, you're out!

36:14.706 --> 36:16.408
This is a scrimmage,
Vreeland,

36:16.608 --> 36:18.126
as in practice,
as in everyone

36:18.326 --> 36:19.719
on the team needs
to get some.

36:19.919 --> 36:21.313
We all know you're
a superstar.

36:21.513 --> 36:22.348
Okay, we got it.

36:22.548 --> 36:24.182
Now save it for
the championship.

36:24.382 --> 36:25.400
Who do we got, Diana?

36:25.600 --> 36:26.418
Katie, you're up.

36:26.618 --> 36:28.186
Okay, Katie, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

36:38.264 --> 36:39.998
The hotel that's
doing our wedding

36:40.198 --> 36:41.233
had a water main break.

36:41.433 --> 36:42.268
The whole place is flooded.

36:42.468 --> 36:45.087
And the repairs won't
be done for months.

36:45.287 --> 36:47.497
Oh, my God, the place
was just so perfect.

36:47.697 --> 36:49.908
I'm never going to find
another place in time.

36:50.108 --> 36:50.709
I'm just...

36:50.909 --> 36:51.943
We will find a place.

36:52.143 --> 36:54.280
I'm sorry.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.416
Lydia never had
a real wedding.

36:57.616 --> 37:03.755
My, uh, my dad died just
before my first and, uh...

37:03.955 --> 37:05.991
Come on, let's get you home.

37:06.191 --> 37:07.726
We'll work this out.

37:07.926 --> 37:10.229
Hey, uh, Paul,

37:10.429 --> 37:12.331
you want to play
tennis with Carmen?

37:12.531 --> 37:13.332
Great shot, Paul.

37:13.532 --> 37:14.133
What?

37:14.333 --> 37:15.301
Lydia needs me, sweetie.

37:15.501 --> 37:16.802
Besides, it'll be a good chance

37:17.002 --> 37:19.237
for you guys
to get to know each other.

37:19.437 --> 37:21.205
Dad, Paul doesn't talk.

37:21.405 --> 37:23.174
Yeah, he's
a little shy.

37:23.374 --> 37:24.776
Go on. It'll be fun.

37:24.976 --> 37:27.245
We'll play tomorrow, okay?

37:27.445 --> 37:29.515
Okay.

37:44.663 --> 37:46.865
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

37:47.065 --> 37:48.133
Oh, my gosh.

37:48.333 --> 37:49.201
Are you okay?

37:49.401 --> 37:51.453
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

37:51.653 --> 37:53.013
It's swelling.

37:53.213 --> 37:54.577
I'm so sorry.

37:54.777 --> 37:56.343
It's no big deal.

37:56.543 --> 37:58.878
We should just stop.

37:59.078 --> 38:01.413
I'm tired anyway.

38:08.487 --> 38:11.657
* *

38:20.499 --> 38:23.669
* *

38:37.749 --> 38:39.718
* *

38:47.893 --> 38:48.694
Oh!

38:49.695 --> 38:51.229
No, I thought...
I didn't...

38:52.230 --> 38:53.432
Well, here's your shirt.

38:53.632 --> 38:55.033
Thanks again.

38:55.233 --> 38:56.435
Lena, wait!

38:56.635 --> 38:58.437
I was just about
to take her out.

38:58.637 --> 38:59.705
Come with me.

38:59.905 --> 39:01.607
No, I shouldn't even
be here at all.

39:04.075 --> 39:05.677
They told you, didn't they?

39:05.877 --> 39:07.279
You think this is funny?

39:07.479 --> 39:09.214
Our grandparents
hate each other.

39:09.414 --> 39:10.349
You knew my name.

39:10.549 --> 39:12.951
Why didn't you just say
something the other day?

39:13.151 --> 39:14.420
Well, because...

39:14.620 --> 39:17.589
the arguments of old men
have nothing to do with us.

39:17.789 --> 39:19.090
Well, they're not
arguing about nothing.

39:19.290 --> 39:20.592
What is... what was
the fight about?

39:20.792 --> 39:21.960
What everything
here is about.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.230
Money and fish.

39:24.430 --> 39:27.316
My grandfather says your
grandfather cheat him.

39:27.516 --> 39:30.402
Your grandfather says my
grandfather sold him fish

39:30.602 --> 39:32.571
that make his whole
restaurant sick.

39:32.771 --> 39:33.972
So what's the truth?

39:34.172 --> 39:39.044
The truth is... that it's
a beautiful day and...

39:39.244 --> 39:41.513
why should the rest
of it matter?

39:42.614 --> 39:44.583
Because it does.

39:49.387 --> 39:50.939
Tibby...

39:51.139 --> 39:52.491
Tibby?

39:52.691 --> 39:53.859
Tibby, now I've had

39:54.059 --> 39:56.211
another complaint
of receipt withholding.

39:56.411 --> 39:58.204
So this is your
second offense and...

39:58.404 --> 40:00.198
You're going to have
to dock my pay.

40:00.398 --> 40:01.433
That's right.

40:01.633 --> 40:03.068
Also, the dress code
strictly prohibits blue jeans.

40:03.268 --> 40:05.036
No problem!

40:05.236 --> 40:06.137
Great.

40:17.983 --> 40:20.351
Wha-What are you doing
with my stuff?

40:20.551 --> 40:21.487
Your mom gave it to me.

40:21.687 --> 40:23.689
I told her I was
your assistant.

40:23.889 --> 40:25.891
You what? Wha...

40:26.091 --> 40:27.793
She seemed to think
it was a good idea.

40:28.994 --> 40:31.529
Okay, look, you seem
like a sweet kid.

40:31.729 --> 40:33.781
No, you seem like a pain
in the ass.

40:33.981 --> 40:36.034
But look, I have
my own friends.

40:36.234 --> 40:37.168
Three best friends.

40:37.368 --> 40:38.737
And even though they left me
here to rot this summer,

40:38.937 --> 40:40.005
I'm not looking
for any new ones.

40:40.205 --> 40:41.072
Neither am I.

40:41.272 --> 40:41.940
I just think

40:42.140 --> 40:43.341
it'd be cool to learn
about filmmaking.

40:43.541 --> 40:44.576
Besides,

40:44.776 --> 40:48.647
I think I found a good subject
for an interview.

40:51.617 --> 40:55.020
His name is Brian McBrian,
king of Dragon's Lair.

40:55.220 --> 40:58.724
I heard he's broken
every record there is.

40:59.891 --> 41:02.393
Okay, so he's definitely
not what you'd call lame,

41:02.593 --> 41:03.362
but I figured he'd be

41:03.562 --> 41:05.664
a good contrast
to all the loser types

41:05.864 --> 41:07.449
in the movie.

41:07.649 --> 41:09.234
Start setting up.

41:12.604 --> 41:13.505
Go stand next to him.

41:13.705 --> 41:14.906
Pretend like
you're a fan.

41:15.106 --> 41:17.008
Like you watch him all
the time or something.

41:17.208 --> 41:18.009
Right.

41:18.209 --> 41:19.177
And...

41:19.377 --> 41:20.145
action.

41:20.345 --> 41:22.113
Video arcade wizards

41:22.313 --> 41:24.899
are fixtures at most
convenience stores.

41:25.099 --> 41:27.686
Brian McBrian is
a fixture at this one.

41:27.886 --> 41:29.521
Dragon's Lair, he says,

41:29.721 --> 41:32.424
is his calling.

41:32.624 --> 41:34.793
Brian, you spend
a lot of time here?

41:34.993 --> 41:37.463
Uh... sometimes, all day.

41:37.663 --> 41:39.798
So, you prefer to spend

41:39.998 --> 41:41.967
most of your time here
at the Quick Mart

41:42.167 --> 41:43.569
instead of out
in the real world?

41:43.769 --> 41:45.503
Well, maybe he finds the
world of Dragon's Lair

41:45.703 --> 41:46.972
more interesting.

41:47.172 --> 41:49.140
Tell us about it,
Brian.

41:49.340 --> 41:52.226
Well, uh...

41:52.426 --> 41:55.113
basically, uh,

41:55.313 --> 41:57.882
you're... Dirk the Daring

41:58.082 --> 42:00.452
in the year 1305 A.D.

42:00.652 --> 42:03.788
See, the goal is to
rescue Princess Daphne

42:03.988 --> 42:07.125
who's being guarded by
a sinister dragon.

42:07.325 --> 42:08.827
See, chamber number one

42:09.027 --> 42:10.796
is the snake room.

42:10.996 --> 42:13.464
See, snakes slither
from the ceiling.

42:13.664 --> 42:14.600
Really?

42:14.800 --> 42:16.267
And you don't even get
to see the dragon

42:16.467 --> 42:18.136
until chamber number 23.

42:18.336 --> 42:20.005
Yeah!

42:21.607 --> 42:22.608
Come on, come
on, come on.

42:22.808 --> 42:23.475
Yeah...

42:23.675 --> 42:24.943
He's right behind you!

42:25.143 --> 42:25.477
Go, go, go.

42:25.677 --> 42:26.628
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:26.828 --> 42:27.737
I got it. I got it.

42:27.937 --> 42:28.976
Watch this. Ready?

42:29.176 --> 42:30.215
Run fast!
Go!

42:30.415 --> 42:31.216
Ooh.

42:36.888 --> 42:39.090
Oh, you must have
run out of tape.

42:39.290 --> 42:39.858
Oh!

42:40.058 --> 42:41.960
What about the rest
of the interview?

42:42.160 --> 42:42.728
Um...

42:42.928 --> 42:43.962
well, we could...
we could always

42:44.162 --> 42:45.163
come back tomorrow, I guess.

42:45.363 --> 42:47.098
I mean, if that's...
if that's cool with you.

42:47.298 --> 42:48.099
Yeah.

42:50.301 --> 42:51.335
Buenos dias.

42:51.535 --> 42:52.370
Como estan?

42:52.570 --> 42:54.906
Que dia tan bueno, no?

42:55.841 --> 42:57.743
Papi, como dormistes, bien?

42:57.943 --> 42:58.577
You all right?

42:58.777 --> 43:00.228
Claro que si, porque no?

43:00.428 --> 43:01.680
Is she speaking
Spanish?

43:01.880 --> 43:04.049
Oh, is that okay?
Is that all right?

43:04.249 --> 43:05.451
Oh, sure, sure.

43:05.651 --> 43:07.736
It's just that nobody
understands it, sweetie.

43:07.936 --> 43:09.821
Oh, come on, Dad, you
know that is not true.

43:10.021 --> 43:13.091
He and my mom, they used to
speak Spanish all the time.

43:13.291 --> 43:15.126
Especially when they
started being all gushy

43:15.326 --> 43:16.411
and they didn't
want me to...

43:16.611 --> 43:17.720
Oh, wow, is it..?
It's 9:00?!

43:17.920 --> 43:18.830
I've got to drop
that check off.

43:19.030 --> 43:20.265
...you know, know what
they were saying,

43:20.465 --> 43:22.000
so they would just, like,
bust out in Spanish.

43:22.200 --> 43:23.334
But I totally
understood them. It was...

43:23.534 --> 43:25.586
Uh, Carmen! Carmen, you're
not going to believe this.

43:25.786 --> 43:27.839
We have decided to have the
wedding right here at home.

43:28.039 --> 43:29.507
With a big party
in the backyard.

43:29.707 --> 43:30.609
Mm-hmm!

43:30.809 --> 43:32.243
Dancing under the stars.
It's gonna be perfect.

43:32.443 --> 43:33.244
Oh, it'll be fabulous.

43:33.444 --> 43:34.212
Que bueno.

43:34.412 --> 43:36.414
Where's, um, Paul?

43:36.614 --> 43:38.817
Oh, he, uh, he had
an appointment.

43:39.017 --> 43:39.851
At the hospital?

43:41.619 --> 43:43.421
Why-Why would
you say that?

43:43.621 --> 43:45.123
Well, we were playing tennis

43:45.323 --> 43:46.825
the other day
and, well, I hit him,

43:47.025 --> 43:47.992
but it was an accident and...

43:48.192 --> 43:48.960
Oh, no,
no, no. He's fine.

43:49.160 --> 43:50.762
He's okay, he's okay.
He just, uh...

43:50.962 --> 43:52.297
He just had
to do something.

43:52.497 --> 43:53.832
Yeah...

44:04.843 --> 44:06.712
Dad, Dad.
Yo.

44:06.912 --> 44:08.413
Dad...

44:08.613 --> 44:10.415
Um, what's going on?

44:10.615 --> 44:12.417
Where exactly is Paul?

44:16.888 --> 44:19.140
He's in Atlanta, honey.

44:19.340 --> 44:21.467
Visiting his father.

44:21.667 --> 44:23.795
His dad's in a facility.

44:23.995 --> 44:25.997
He's an alcoholic.

44:26.197 --> 44:30.568
Every month, Paul
takes a bus to visit him.

44:30.768 --> 44:32.003
Krista refuses to see him.

44:32.203 --> 44:34.139
She's, she's not
ready for that.

44:34.339 --> 44:37.342
Lydia doesn't want to upset her
by talking about it,

44:37.542 --> 44:41.146
so we just say that Paul
is out for the day.

44:42.380 --> 44:44.716
Okay.

44:46.818 --> 44:48.953
Natasha...

44:49.153 --> 44:51.489
Olivia...

44:51.689 --> 44:53.825
Bridget...

44:54.025 --> 44:55.626
Polly...

44:55.826 --> 44:57.228
Jana...

44:57.428 --> 44:58.429
Oh, tampons!

44:58.629 --> 44:59.630
That's special, Mom!

44:59.830 --> 45:00.431
Joe...

45:00.631 --> 45:01.632
Welcome to camp.

45:01.832 --> 45:02.800
Tampons.

45:03.000 --> 45:03.969
Diana...

45:08.006 --> 45:09.274
Uh-huh. Shampoo.

45:09.474 --> 45:11.709
Very, very practical, Mother.

45:18.549 --> 45:20.752
Hamburgers.

45:20.952 --> 45:22.187
Every day...

45:22.387 --> 45:23.421
Oh, did you guys hear?

45:23.621 --> 45:24.455
Actually, they're, uh,

45:24.655 --> 45:26.324
finally giving
us Saturday off.

45:26.524 --> 45:27.125
Oh, hallelujah.

45:27.325 --> 45:29.260
Can you say "cantina"?

45:29.460 --> 45:31.396
Hey, where's the cantina?

45:31.596 --> 45:32.263
I don't know.

45:32.463 --> 45:34.432
I think somewhere
up the road. Why?

45:34.632 --> 45:36.601
He wants me to go.

45:36.801 --> 45:38.203
What?

45:38.403 --> 45:39.887
He wants me to go.

45:40.087 --> 45:41.372
Come on, why else

45:41.572 --> 45:43.942
would he have said that
right in front of me?

45:46.644 --> 45:48.213
Oh, this is
my favorite part.

45:48.413 --> 45:50.782
When he takes the big risk
and launches the catapults.

45:50.982 --> 45:52.533
Shh, Bailey, come on.
I'm trying to see

45:52.733 --> 45:54.285
if there's something
we can use from this.

45:54.485 --> 45:56.187
This whole thing...

45:57.755 --> 46:02.493
What was in the package?

46:02.693 --> 46:03.929
Uh, just, mm...

46:04.129 --> 46:06.331
just those pair
of pants over there.

46:06.531 --> 46:10.368
I'm sharing them with
my friends for the summer.

46:11.436 --> 46:13.371
These?

46:14.906 --> 46:16.791
What's so great about
an old pair of jeans?

46:16.991 --> 46:18.985
Uh, nothing.
They... They just happened

46:19.185 --> 46:21.179
to mysteriously
fit us all perfectly.

46:21.379 --> 46:23.581
Really?

46:23.781 --> 46:26.051
I wonder what they'd
look like on me.

46:26.251 --> 46:27.585
You know,
on the off chance

46:27.785 --> 46:29.888
you'd ever let me
try them on...?

46:30.088 --> 46:31.122
Like now, for example.

46:31.322 --> 46:31.957
Bailey, go ahead.

46:32.157 --> 46:33.424
Just do whatever you want, okay?

46:33.624 --> 46:34.325
I need some quiet.

46:36.895 --> 46:38.596
Tibby!

46:38.796 --> 46:42.200
I need you
to take the baby!

47:10.061 --> 47:11.763
My Carmapoochiez...

47:11.963 --> 47:15.233
I'm writing from the post
office, and this express mail

47:15.433 --> 47:17.702
costs more than I make
in two hours at Wallmans,

47:17.902 --> 47:20.305
so these jeans better
get to you tomorrow.

47:21.372 --> 47:22.973
Here we are on a typical
Bethesda corner,

47:23.173 --> 47:24.575
where generations
of young entrepreneurs

47:24.775 --> 47:27.578
have proved the old adage,
when life hands you lemons,

47:27.778 --> 47:28.479
make lemonade.

47:28.679 --> 47:30.381
So the question on my mind is:

47:30.581 --> 47:32.083
Is this fresh-squeezed
or powder?

47:32.283 --> 47:34.119
What does it matter,
if it's good lemonade?

47:34.319 --> 47:35.503
Shh, Bailey, let me...

47:35.703 --> 47:36.688
let me ask
the questions.

47:36.888 --> 47:39.057
I'm sad to report
that absolutely nothing

47:39.257 --> 47:41.592
of consequence happened to me
while wearing the pants.

47:41.792 --> 47:42.694
Um, I spilled a Sprite

47:42.894 --> 47:44.212
and Duncan,
my rat-faced manager,

47:44.412 --> 47:45.730
accused me
of receipt withholding.

47:45.930 --> 47:46.597
Receipt withholding.

47:46.797 --> 47:48.266
In rat-faced manager lingo,

47:48.466 --> 47:50.301
that means forgetting to give
the customer a sales slip.

47:50.501 --> 47:52.137
You know, I was reading
that Bill Gates,

47:52.337 --> 47:54.539
when he was younger,
he ran a lemonade stand.

47:54.739 --> 47:56.942
That... you don't
know that. That's not...

47:57.142 --> 47:58.076
Yeah, I do. I read
it in a magazine.

47:58.276 --> 48:00.045
Where... what...
where did you read that?

48:00.245 --> 48:01.079
In a magazine.

48:01.279 --> 48:02.597
Other than that, the only thing

48:02.797 --> 48:04.006
that I have
to show for the pants

48:04.206 --> 48:05.645
is the kid that delivered them.

48:05.845 --> 48:07.085
Some wiseass, pain in the neck

48:07.285 --> 48:09.154
who's decided to permanently
glue herself to my hip.

48:09.354 --> 48:10.371
...she's just tired.

48:10.571 --> 48:11.389
That's what she is.

48:11.589 --> 48:12.991
She's been there a really
long time... all day.

48:13.191 --> 48:14.225
What is she doing
right there? Tell me.

48:14.425 --> 48:15.360
She's-She's just thinking.
She's strategizing.

48:15.560 --> 48:16.127
She's thinking?

48:16.327 --> 48:17.695
And that's what
you can't see.

48:17.895 --> 48:19.630
I think she's trying to grow a
brain, that's what she's doing.

48:19.830 --> 48:21.399
Too bad you can't
express mail 12-year-olds.

48:21.599 --> 48:22.767
...and I wish you
the very best

48:22.967 --> 48:23.969
of luck on
this endeavor.

48:32.843 --> 48:35.380
* *

48:43.888 --> 48:46.157
* *

48:47.525 --> 48:48.459
Hey.

48:48.659 --> 48:49.927
Hey, there, sleepy head.

48:50.127 --> 48:50.762
Hey, Carmen.

48:50.962 --> 48:52.897
Hey, time to wake up.

48:53.097 --> 48:53.765
Hi.

48:53.965 --> 48:56.101
Hi, there.
Good morning.

48:56.301 --> 48:57.535
Sorry to wake you,

48:57.735 --> 49:00.738
but I was just wondering if
Maria could grab your sheets.

49:00.938 --> 49:01.472
Maria?

49:01.672 --> 49:03.674
Our housekeeper.

49:03.874 --> 49:05.176
I told her

49:05.376 --> 49:07.278
you usually slept
late, but uh,

49:07.478 --> 49:09.363
I don't think she understood me.

49:09.563 --> 49:11.449
Her-Her English isn't real good.

49:11.649 --> 49:13.351
Um...

49:13.551 --> 49:14.568
okay, right.

49:14.768 --> 49:15.586
Uh... could I...

49:15.786 --> 49:17.922
I'll just wash my own sheets.

49:18.122 --> 49:19.123
No, no, no, no.

49:19.323 --> 49:20.125
Don't be silly.

49:20.325 --> 49:22.127
Maria can certainly
do your sheets...

49:22.327 --> 49:22.928
not a problem.

49:23.128 --> 49:24.129
Lydia, it's really, it's...

49:24.329 --> 49:25.330
It's a beautiful day.

49:25.530 --> 49:26.964
There's no reason why you
should be washing sheets.

49:27.164 --> 49:28.482
Oh, it's not a problem at all.

49:28.682 --> 49:30.001
I usually do it
myself, anyway.

49:30.201 --> 49:31.319
I do it all the time.

49:31.519 --> 49:32.437
I'm so used to it.

49:32.637 --> 49:35.440
People wash their sheets
all the time.

49:36.774 --> 49:38.643
Okay.

50:31.929 --> 50:33.764
Been here long?

50:33.964 --> 50:34.732
Kostas...

50:34.932 --> 50:37.135
what are you doing here?

50:37.335 --> 50:38.403
It's a fish market.

50:38.603 --> 50:41.106
This is where
I sell my fish.

50:41.306 --> 50:42.073
Right.

50:42.273 --> 50:44.509
But you already
knew that, eh?

50:44.709 --> 50:46.511
Excuse me?

50:46.711 --> 50:49.180
Yeah, no one sits near
a smelly fish market

50:49.380 --> 50:50.715
unless they're
waiting for someone.

50:50.915 --> 50:53.551
Um, well, I don't know
what you're talking about.

50:53.751 --> 50:55.219
I mean, I just came
to sketch

50:55.419 --> 50:56.887
that old church
over there, so...

50:57.087 --> 50:57.688
May I?

50:57.888 --> 51:00.391
Um... well, it's...

51:00.591 --> 51:03.094
it's not finished.

51:10.568 --> 51:13.538
You didn't tell me
you were an artist.

51:13.738 --> 51:15.323
I'm not, really.

51:15.523 --> 51:16.908
Lena, you are.

51:17.108 --> 51:18.709
My parents were married

51:18.909 --> 51:22.580
in that church before they left
for the United States.

51:22.780 --> 51:24.915
Why did they come
back to Greece?

51:25.115 --> 51:27.152
They didn't.

51:27.352 --> 51:32.223
They were killed in a car
accident when I was 12.

51:32.423 --> 51:36.194
I come back to live
with my grandfather.

51:36.394 --> 51:38.463
I'm sorry.

51:38.663 --> 51:42.133
What made you choose
to paint this?

51:43.334 --> 51:45.836
Uh, I don't know.

51:46.036 --> 51:49.274
Um, I liked it because,
when you first look at it,

51:49.474 --> 51:51.409
it looks kind of
forgotten, and then...

51:51.609 --> 51:54.779
but then you realize that
that's why it's beautiful.

51:54.979 --> 51:58.149
It's... It's perfect
in all its loneliness.

52:00.185 --> 52:02.020
You see?

52:02.220 --> 52:04.972
Lena Kaligaras,

52:05.172 --> 52:07.725
you are an artist.

52:07.925 --> 52:09.860
And you should finish it.

52:11.262 --> 52:12.763
Well, maybe some other time.

52:12.963 --> 52:14.265
I mean, I really should go.

52:14.465 --> 52:16.867
If my grandparents
saw me here, they...

52:17.067 --> 52:17.835
They what?

52:18.035 --> 52:20.938
Is it really them
you're afraid of?

52:21.138 --> 52:23.174
Or is it something else?

52:25.976 --> 52:27.078
What do you mean?

52:27.278 --> 52:29.146
You don't even know me.

52:29.346 --> 52:30.081
I'm trying to.

52:30.281 --> 52:32.583
Can't you see that?

52:41.759 --> 52:44.595
* *

52:54.339 --> 52:56.607
* *

53:06.617 --> 53:09.654
* *

53:19.730 --> 53:21.899
He's right, Car.

53:22.099 --> 53:24.069
I am afraid.

53:24.269 --> 53:27.572
There's a part of me
that wants to let him in,

53:27.772 --> 53:31.342
but then I feel myself
put this wall up.

53:31.542 --> 53:33.778
And I don't understand why.

53:33.978 --> 53:37.331
Maybe that's what strikes me
most about Kostas.

53:37.531 --> 53:40.885
That despite everything
he suffered, he can still

53:41.085 --> 53:45.022
look at life in the most
uncomplicated way.

53:45.222 --> 53:48.726
I've never known
that kind of faith.

53:48.926 --> 53:50.161
It makes me so sad that people

53:50.361 --> 53:55.132
like Kostas and Bridget,
who have lost everything,

53:55.332 --> 53:58.169
can still be open to love.

53:58.369 --> 54:03.207
While I, who have
lost nothing, am not.

54:04.509 --> 54:07.462
* Can I ask you
a question, please? *

54:07.662 --> 54:10.490
* Promise you won't
laugh at me *

54:10.690 --> 54:13.989
* Honestly, I'm standing here *

54:14.189 --> 54:16.973
* Afraid I'll be betrayed *

54:17.173 --> 54:19.757
* As twisted as it seems *

54:19.957 --> 54:24.228
* I only feel love
when it's in my dreams *

54:24.428 --> 54:26.981
* So let in the morning light *

54:27.181 --> 54:31.510
* And let the
darkness fade away *

54:31.710 --> 54:36.561
* Can you turn
my black roses red? *

54:36.761 --> 54:41.412
* Can you turn my black roses
red? *

54:41.612 --> 54:46.083
* Yeah, I feel like
I've never known love *

54:46.283 --> 54:49.019
* I feel like
I've never known love *

54:49.219 --> 54:54.058
* Love...*

55:24.522 --> 55:26.524
She's at the doctor's.

55:26.724 --> 55:28.159
Who is?

55:28.359 --> 55:29.527
Little girl next door.

55:29.727 --> 55:30.695
I don't know why, though.

55:30.895 --> 55:33.163
I heard they were
stopping treatment.

55:33.363 --> 55:34.199
Treatment?

55:34.399 --> 55:35.833
She has leukemia.

55:36.033 --> 55:39.670
Found it a couple
of years ago, poor thing.

55:49.079 --> 55:50.681
Is that her?

55:51.482 --> 55:52.483
Yeah.

56:06.797 --> 56:08.182
What is that?!

56:08.382 --> 56:09.767
Oh!

56:14.071 --> 56:18.943
*...enamorado
por un rato, por un rato *

56:19.143 --> 56:22.229
* No se acuerda ni tu nombre *

56:22.429 --> 56:25.516
* Por un rato, por un rato *

56:37.161 --> 56:38.796
Hi.

56:40.631 --> 56:41.932
What are you doing here?

56:42.132 --> 56:43.434
You shouldn't be here.

56:43.634 --> 56:44.802
I'm not drinking.

56:45.002 --> 56:47.472
But if you don't dance with
me, I might have to start.

56:50.741 --> 56:51.942
* Well,
when the boogie starts *

56:52.142 --> 56:53.444
* I start flippin'
with my left hand *

56:53.644 --> 56:54.745
* Before I get to the last lap *

56:54.945 --> 56:56.614
* And that's the passion
that I feel for this *

56:56.814 --> 56:58.483
* A little more than blood,
sweat for this *

56:58.683 --> 57:00.184
* Ay, cabron, ya llego *

57:00.384 --> 57:02.586
* Negrito de Los Angelitos
with my people *

57:02.786 --> 57:04.605
* Everybody, come on,
get y'all grito *

57:04.805 --> 57:06.624
* I'm-a do it
till you're feeling it... *

57:08.158 --> 57:09.460
* You deliver the goods
like Doritos *

57:09.660 --> 57:10.628
* Every time I step to the mic *

57:10.828 --> 57:11.796
* It's like freedom *

57:13.498 --> 57:16.033
* Insane, loco,
mad in the coco... *

57:16.233 --> 57:18.335
Bridget...

57:18.535 --> 57:20.638
I... I can't.

57:21.572 --> 57:23.440
I... I can't do this.

57:23.640 --> 57:24.709
I'm sorry.

57:32.382 --> 57:37.087
* Hey, kid, your time
has come to change *

57:37.287 --> 57:38.289
...not at all.

57:38.489 --> 57:40.558
* Though I need you more
than I've needed anyone *

57:40.758 --> 57:42.527
* In any way tonight *

57:42.727 --> 57:47.598
* Hey, kid, yeah,
I know it won't be long *

57:47.798 --> 57:49.266
* The captain's calling... *

57:50.635 --> 57:51.969
* Come to see you back
where we belong *

57:52.169 --> 57:54.421
* Something inside me
is breaking *

57:54.621 --> 57:56.482
Don't forget to steer.
That's good.

57:56.682 --> 57:58.213
* Something inside says *

57:58.413 --> 57:59.744
Slow down,
slow down.

57:59.944 --> 58:02.079
* There's somewhere
better than this *

58:02.279 --> 58:06.950
* Sunset sailing
on April skies *

58:07.150 --> 58:11.655
* Bloodshot fire clouds
in her eyes *

58:11.855 --> 58:16.360
* I can't say
what I might believe *

58:16.560 --> 58:18.795
* But if God made you *

58:18.995 --> 58:21.231
* Yeah, He's in love *

58:21.431 --> 58:25.252
* With me *

58:25.452 --> 58:29.073
* Yeah *

58:29.273 --> 58:32.610
* He's in love with me *

58:32.810 --> 58:38.616
* Love, love, love,
love, love. *

58:45.055 --> 58:48.058
So, uh, Bertie, what
do you like best

58:48.258 --> 58:50.494
about working
here at Wallmans?

58:50.694 --> 58:52.029
Pays the bills.

58:52.229 --> 58:53.798
Well, most of them anyway.

58:53.998 --> 58:54.999
I also work part-time

58:55.199 --> 58:57.735
over at the sweet
shop across the way.

58:57.935 --> 59:00.404
They've got one of them,
um, blending machines,

59:00.604 --> 59:01.672
you know, for the mixings,

59:01.872 --> 59:05.810
and whenever I get bored I...
I do experiments.

59:06.010 --> 59:06.677
Experiments?

59:06.877 --> 59:07.878
Oh, that's
so cool.

59:08.078 --> 59:10.347
Here, plug that in.
Sorry I'm late.

59:10.547 --> 59:11.582
It's okay.

59:11.782 --> 59:14.568
What's your best one so far?

59:14.768 --> 59:17.212
Uh... gee, I
don't know. I...

59:17.412 --> 59:19.652
Oh, there was one
the other day

59:19.852 --> 59:22.223
and it turned out
really good.

59:22.423 --> 59:24.326
It had, um, pralines,
blueberries

59:24.526 --> 59:26.430
and a whole bunch
of graham crackers.

59:26.630 --> 59:27.297
Awesome.

59:27.497 --> 59:29.500
You know Baskin-Robbins?

59:29.700 --> 59:31.235
They hire these
ice cream scientists

59:31.435 --> 59:34.338
whose job is to invent
three new flavors every month.

59:34.538 --> 59:35.472
Really?

59:35.672 --> 59:36.407
Yeah.

59:36.607 --> 59:37.457
You know who'd be good

59:37.657 --> 59:38.508
at something like that?

59:38.708 --> 59:40.244
You.

59:40.444 --> 59:42.913
You think so?

59:44.148 --> 59:46.350
Oh, geez, I got
to get back to work.

59:46.550 --> 59:48.218
Duncan's gonna have a hissy fit.

59:48.418 --> 59:49.586
See you later.

59:53.958 --> 59:55.125
Sorry.

59:55.325 --> 59:58.796
I know you hate it when I butt
in like that, I just...

59:58.996 --> 59:59.964
It's okay.

01:00:00.164 --> 01:00:02.232
I didn't mean to mess up
the whole interview...

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:03.033
You didn't.

01:00:03.233 --> 01:00:06.336
You... You were good.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:13.026
So, uh, who told you?

01:00:13.226 --> 01:00:15.513
Uh, told me what?

01:00:15.713 --> 01:00:16.814
You found out, didn't you?

01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:19.750
We still have time
for one more interview.

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:22.619
It's called leukemia.

01:00:24.855 --> 01:00:27.424
Yeah, and I would
like to come with you.

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:31.829
But are you just asking
'cause you feel sorry for me?

01:00:33.764 --> 01:00:36.033
I don't know.

01:00:38.703 --> 01:00:40.871
Maybe.

01:00:45.509 --> 01:00:47.678
Okay.

01:00:47.878 --> 01:00:50.047
O-Okay.

01:00:57.722 --> 01:01:01.926
* *

01:01:03.527 --> 01:01:07.531
I'll just take the hem up
and it'll be perfect.

01:01:07.731 --> 01:01:09.266
You look
beautiful.

01:01:09.466 --> 01:01:11.001
I love it, Mama.

01:01:11.201 --> 01:01:12.436
Carmen?

01:01:12.636 --> 01:01:14.739
Carmen, you're next, sweetheart.

01:01:18.408 --> 01:01:19.676
Uh, I-I beg your pardon?

01:01:20.945 --> 01:01:22.363
I look like a tramp.

01:01:22.563 --> 01:01:23.781
Oh, dear.
Um...

01:01:23.981 --> 01:01:26.033
I'm-I'm sure Barbara can, uh,

01:01:26.233 --> 01:01:28.285
can-can work on this for you.

01:01:28.485 --> 01:01:30.254
Here you go.

01:01:31.856 --> 01:01:33.724
Oh, well, let's,
let's see here.

01:01:33.924 --> 01:01:36.560
Uh, well, we need
to let this out here.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.729
Um, right, right.
Way out.

01:01:38.929 --> 01:01:39.797
And, um...

01:01:39.997 --> 01:01:42.332
hopefully, we can dig
up some extra fabric.

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:43.400
And maybe we can...

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.385
This needs
some serious work here.

01:01:45.585 --> 01:01:47.171
Frankly, I think
we're better off

01:01:47.371 --> 01:01:49.706
just starting from
scratch on this one.

01:01:49.906 --> 01:01:52.242
Okay, good, um,
can I take this off now?

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:54.278
Oh, sure.
Certainly, darling.

01:01:54.478 --> 01:01:55.445
Go ahead.

01:01:57.748 --> 01:01:58.883
Barbara,
I'm so sorry.

01:01:59.083 --> 01:02:01.118
I had no idea her
father would be so off

01:02:01.318 --> 01:02:02.319
when he guessed
her size.

01:02:02.519 --> 01:02:05.823
Well, usually, a roughly
constructed prototype

01:02:06.023 --> 01:02:07.624
works as
a starting point,

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:08.659
but in this case...

01:02:08.859 --> 01:02:10.928
Maybe we could add
a long-line corset lift?

01:02:11.128 --> 01:02:12.429
Yes, that'll cinch it in.

01:02:12.629 --> 01:02:13.446
Right, beautiful.

01:02:13.646 --> 01:02:14.264
It is a wedding,

01:02:14.464 --> 01:02:16.266
and I do want it
to... to look uniform.

01:02:16.466 --> 01:02:18.335
I mean, will she
look like Krista?

01:02:18.535 --> 01:02:18.936
Definitely.

01:02:19.136 --> 01:02:20.437
You know, just never mind.

01:02:20.637 --> 01:02:23.640
We will fix the hem on Krista's
and we'll just, uh...

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.342
start over on the other one.

01:02:25.542 --> 01:02:25.843
Carmen.

01:02:26.043 --> 01:02:27.778
The other one's name,

01:02:27.978 --> 01:02:29.129
it's Carmen.

01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:30.280
Car-men.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.448
And you know what, Lydia?

01:02:31.648 --> 01:02:33.017
Just forget
about the dress, okay?

01:02:33.217 --> 01:02:35.285
We can just tell everybody
that Carmen's Puerto Rican,

01:02:35.485 --> 01:02:36.887
and it never
occurred to you

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:38.722
that she might be
built differently.

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:40.557
Or that unlike you
and your daughter,

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:41.959
she has an ass

01:02:42.159 --> 01:02:44.161
that the tailor
didn't have enough

01:02:44.361 --> 01:02:45.495
bolts of material to cover.

01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:49.033
Or better yet, just tell
everyone there is no Carmen.

01:02:49.233 --> 01:02:51.101
Carmen doesn't exist.

01:02:53.570 --> 01:02:54.805
Carmen, honey...

01:02:55.005 --> 01:02:56.040
Carmen!

01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:14.458
One, two, three!

01:03:14.658 --> 01:03:16.760
Okay, ladies, time
to call out the cavalry.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:17.762
Now, listen up.

01:03:17.962 --> 01:03:19.430
To secure a spot
in the playoffs,

01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:20.898
we're gonna
shake it up a little bit.

01:03:21.098 --> 01:03:23.533
Just get the ball to Wendy
and Carrie to midfield.

01:03:23.733 --> 01:03:24.718
Bridget's the sweeper.

01:03:24.918 --> 01:03:25.703
What?!
You heard me.

01:03:25.903 --> 01:03:27.171
I don't want to see you
go past midfield.

01:03:27.371 --> 01:03:28.172
You got that? Now go!

01:03:30.841 --> 01:03:32.743
Dear Lena,

01:03:32.943 --> 01:03:36.113
when I got your letter I
screamed for about ten minutes.

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:38.548
So, you found
a hottie after all, huh?

01:03:38.748 --> 01:03:40.116
Well, me, too.

01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:41.485
His name is Eric.

01:03:41.685 --> 01:03:45.555
Did I mention he's one of the
coaches and 100% off-limits?

01:03:45.755 --> 01:03:47.057
But I don't care.

01:03:47.257 --> 01:03:50.360
I've never wanted anything
this much in my entire life.

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.897
I'm still waiting
for Carmapoochiez

01:03:53.097 --> 01:03:54.331
to send me the pants.

01:03:54.531 --> 01:03:57.101
And in the meantime, I'm
throwing all my pent-up energy

01:03:57.301 --> 01:03:59.103
into soccer,
although that only seems

01:03:59.303 --> 01:04:00.737
to get me in more trouble.

01:04:00.937 --> 01:04:02.172
What can I say?

01:04:02.372 --> 01:04:03.407
I'm obsessed.

01:04:03.607 --> 01:04:04.408
And as we all know,

01:04:04.608 --> 01:04:06.176
obsessed girls cannot be

01:04:06.376 --> 01:04:09.279
responsible
for our actions, can we?

01:04:09.479 --> 01:04:12.216
* You can't stop this feeling *

01:04:12.416 --> 01:04:16.520
* You cannot run away *
Pass, Vreeland!

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.323
* Baby, I want
some of your mind *

01:04:19.523 --> 01:04:22.326
* Can't stop this feeling *

01:04:22.526 --> 01:04:24.428
* There's no escape *

01:04:24.628 --> 01:04:26.330
* No sleep tonight *

01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:31.201
* No sleep tonight,
no sleep tonight *

01:04:31.401 --> 01:04:33.537
* No sleep tonight. *

01:04:44.548 --> 01:04:48.719
Hey.

01:04:48.919 --> 01:04:51.055
Saw you watch me play today.

01:04:51.255 --> 01:04:52.556
What'd you think?

01:04:52.756 --> 01:04:53.858
Uh...

01:04:54.058 --> 01:04:58.695
I don't know
if I've ever seen anyone...

01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:00.697
with that much intensity.

01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:03.567
Ever.

01:05:03.767 --> 01:05:04.869
Well, I think I might have been

01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:06.336
showing off for you
just a little bit.

01:05:06.536 --> 01:05:07.537
Just a little bit?
Yeah.

01:05:08.538 --> 01:05:11.842
No.

01:05:12.042 --> 01:05:14.511
You know, it's more than that.

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:20.050
You scare the hell out of me.

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:25.755
Single-minded
to the point of recklessness.

01:05:25.955 --> 01:05:26.723
What?

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:29.626
It's what the school
shrink called me.

01:05:29.826 --> 01:05:33.847
After my mom died, a few
of the teachers thought that,

01:05:34.047 --> 01:05:38.068
I don't know, I needed
to be evaluated or something.

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:42.072
So I met with a guy.

01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:46.076
I talked and he wrote.

01:05:50.347 --> 01:05:53.083
I've never told
anyone that before.

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:55.285
Okay, Bridget, I...

01:05:55.485 --> 01:05:58.622
No, don't say
anything.

01:05:58.822 --> 01:06:00.290
Not now, okay?

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:09.299
Hey, come on, I'll race you.

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:40.064
* *

01:06:49.873 --> 01:06:56.780
* *

01:07:03.487 --> 01:07:04.088
Here you go.

01:07:04.288 --> 01:07:06.490
You got a key,
honey?

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:07.357
No.

01:07:07.557 --> 01:07:09.326
Doesn't look like
anybody's home.

01:07:09.526 --> 01:07:11.295
They're probably
out looking for me,

01:07:11.495 --> 01:07:12.496
but I'll be fine.

01:07:12.696 --> 01:07:13.497
Thank you.

01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:14.498
All right.

01:08:14.458 --> 01:08:15.742
Hi, this is Tibby.

01:08:15.942 --> 01:08:17.027
Here comes the beep.

01:08:17.227 --> 01:08:18.795
Hopefully you know
what to do with it.

01:08:19.962 --> 01:08:21.365
Tib, it's me. It's Carmen.

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:22.765
I'm coming home.

01:08:22.966 --> 01:08:26.336
Everything got screwed up and I
snapped and I don't care and...

01:08:26.536 --> 01:08:29.473
I'm just fed up
and I can't be here, so...

01:08:29.673 --> 01:08:31.375
I called you 'cause I knew...

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:35.779
...knew you'd understand.

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:45.822
You know what I like
most about the stars?

01:08:46.022 --> 01:08:49.158
You look at 'em...
at all of 'em up there...

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:52.395
and you just know
there's got to be

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:54.698
something more than...

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:59.636
Life?

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:04.541
There has to be.

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:19.023
Are you scared?

01:09:19.223 --> 01:09:21.125
Not of dying, really.

01:09:21.325 --> 01:09:26.162
It's more that
I'm afraid of... time.

01:09:26.362 --> 01:09:29.198
Not having enough of it.

01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:33.569
Time to figure out
who I'm supposed to be,

01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:37.407
to find my place in the world
before I have to leave it.

01:09:40.977 --> 01:09:44.381
I'm afraid of what I'll miss.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:55.725
What?

01:09:55.925 --> 01:09:58.695
N-Nothing.

01:10:03.233 --> 01:10:05.835
Well, Bridget

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:08.087
just lights
everything up.

01:10:08.287 --> 01:10:10.340
She makes everything more fun.

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:11.441
And Carmen...

01:10:11.641 --> 01:10:14.878
is brilliant, but
she doesn't know it.

01:10:15.078 --> 01:10:18.114
And Tibby... well,
Tibby kind of

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:19.999
marches
to her own drum.

01:10:20.199 --> 01:10:21.885
I'm kind of
jealous of her.

01:10:22.085 --> 01:10:24.187
Why?

01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:26.290
Um...

01:10:26.490 --> 01:10:29.058
well, because
she knows who she is.

01:10:29.258 --> 01:10:31.295
Don't you?

01:10:31.495 --> 01:10:33.430
Um, I don't know.

01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:36.833
I think I know who I want to be.

01:10:37.033 --> 01:10:40.236
What you were saying
the other day

01:10:40.436 --> 01:10:41.471
about me
being afraid,

01:10:41.671 --> 01:10:48.512
well...
it's hard to explain.

01:10:48.712 --> 01:10:51.848
Um... all my life,

01:10:52.048 --> 01:10:59.456
everybody's always kind
of seen me a certain way,

01:10:59.656 --> 01:11:02.909
um, and I didn't,
I don't...

01:11:03.109 --> 01:11:06.363
That's all right;
I understand.

01:11:06.563 --> 01:11:07.948
Do you?

01:11:08.148 --> 01:11:09.333
Yeah.

01:11:09.533 --> 01:11:12.202
Some people show off
their beauty

01:11:12.402 --> 01:11:15.054
because they want
the world to see it.

01:11:15.254 --> 01:11:18.950
Others try to hide
their beauty because...

01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:22.846
they want the world
to see something else.

01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:26.816
And what do you see?

01:11:34.090 --> 01:11:36.860
Everything.

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:05.555
Dear Bridget,

01:12:05.755 --> 01:12:06.990
I guess I was kidding myself

01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:09.025
to think that,
when the pants arrived,

01:12:09.225 --> 01:12:11.661
they were somehow gonna
make everything better.

01:12:11.861 --> 01:12:15.432
I mean, I don't blame them
for what happened, but...

01:12:15.632 --> 01:12:16.833
Anyway, I do hope

01:12:17.033 --> 01:12:19.269
that they bring you better
luck than they did me.

01:12:19.469 --> 01:12:23.106
And even more than that, B,
may they bring you good sense.

01:12:23.306 --> 01:12:24.608
I know it sounds boring,

01:12:24.808 --> 01:12:27.043
but trust me
from recent experience,

01:12:27.243 --> 01:12:28.578
a little common sense,

01:12:28.778 --> 01:12:31.114
it's not such a bad thing, B.

01:12:31.314 --> 01:12:33.633
Wear them well.

01:12:33.833 --> 01:12:36.010
Love you, Carmen.

01:12:36.210 --> 01:12:38.188
Your dad called.

01:12:38.388 --> 01:12:41.525
He wanted to make sure
you got home okay.

01:12:46.129 --> 01:12:47.897
I'm so sorry, baby.

01:12:48.097 --> 01:12:49.298
I knew this would happen.

01:12:49.498 --> 01:12:50.634
Mom, please.

01:12:50.834 --> 01:12:53.737
Now you know why I was so
afraid of you going there.

01:12:53.937 --> 01:12:55.605
I don't want to say
I told you so, but...

01:12:55.805 --> 01:12:56.906
Then don't.

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:28.071
Morning!

01:13:28.271 --> 01:13:29.839
Don't you
ever sleep?

01:13:30.039 --> 01:13:31.508
What for?

01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:33.209
This just
came for you.

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:35.912
Oh, my God.
They're finally here.

01:13:36.112 --> 01:13:37.747
What's here?

01:13:37.947 --> 01:13:40.249
Do you guys realize
what this means?

01:13:40.449 --> 01:13:42.752
That you're hugging
a pair of jeans?

01:13:42.952 --> 01:13:45.655
These aren't
just jeans.

01:13:45.855 --> 01:13:48.558
They make things happen.

01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:52.896
Sweet.

01:13:53.096 --> 01:13:55.665
I felt like I was
living in some freak show

01:13:55.865 --> 01:13:57.400
known as the Land
of the Blondes,

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:58.784
and guess who was the freak.

01:13:58.984 --> 01:14:01.145
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

01:14:01.345 --> 01:14:03.293
It was!
It was horrible!

01:14:03.493 --> 01:14:05.441
Okay, Paul... he doesn't talk.

01:14:05.641 --> 01:14:06.976
He didn't say a word.

01:14:07.176 --> 01:14:08.077
And Krista,

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:10.446
she's this
perky little...

01:14:10.646 --> 01:14:11.881
nightmare.

01:14:12.081 --> 01:14:16.352
And her and her mom, they're,
like, sunshine twins on uppers,

01:14:16.552 --> 01:14:17.654
except when,
God forbid,

01:14:17.854 --> 01:14:20.324
something happened
with the wedding plans.

01:14:20.524 --> 01:14:23.994
Because, Tibby, I don't think
there was a single conversation

01:14:24.194 --> 01:14:27.664
that didn't revolve around
flowers or hors d'oeuvre menus

01:14:27.864 --> 01:14:30.183
or guest lists
or tablecloths or...

01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:32.702
I'm sure they were just excited.

01:14:34.504 --> 01:14:37.340
Tib, can you pretend
to be on my side?

01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:38.742
It's not
about sides,

01:14:38.942 --> 01:14:42.912
Car, there are worse things
than your dad getting married.

01:14:43.112 --> 01:14:45.749
Sure, he probably could
have handled it better...

01:14:45.949 --> 01:14:47.917
Tibby, he didn't
handle it at all.

01:14:48.117 --> 01:14:48.518
Tell him that.

01:14:48.718 --> 01:14:49.953
Why should
I have to?

01:14:50.153 --> 01:14:51.721
You shouldn't have to throw
a rock at him, either.

01:14:51.921 --> 01:14:53.389
I didn't throw a rock at him.

01:14:53.589 --> 01:14:54.257
I threw it at them.

01:14:54.457 --> 01:14:55.692
They're the problem, Tibby.

01:14:55.892 --> 01:14:58.361
They're the ones
who ruined everything.

01:14:58.561 --> 01:15:01.030
And why are you giving me
this hypocritical

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:03.399
lecture about
treating people decently

01:15:03.599 --> 01:15:05.201
when you walk
around screaming

01:15:05.401 --> 01:15:06.169
"Screw the world!"

01:15:06.369 --> 01:15:09.272
because that's easier
than feeling something?

01:15:18.982 --> 01:15:24.253
* *

01:15:35.464 --> 01:15:41.871
* *

01:16:14.704 --> 01:16:21.110
* *

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:36.125
* *

01:16:45.468 --> 01:16:50.006
* *

01:16:59.816 --> 01:17:03.052
* *

01:17:03.252 --> 01:17:05.388
I think she's

01:17:05.588 --> 01:17:07.356
getting
too much sun.

01:17:09.625 --> 01:17:11.094
You're probably right.

01:17:11.294 --> 01:17:15.231
Maybe I'll go for a walk,
get some fresh air.

01:17:45.394 --> 01:17:47.263
Oh, look out.

01:18:10.887 --> 01:18:13.406
Can't you stay
another week?

01:18:13.606 --> 01:18:16.125
My classes start on Monday.

01:18:16.325 --> 01:18:17.426
I have to go.

01:18:18.427 --> 01:18:20.730
I just...

01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:23.582
I feel like...

01:18:23.782 --> 01:18:26.435
I know. Me, too.

01:18:29.438 --> 01:18:31.908
I love you, Lena.

01:18:48.457 --> 01:18:49.792
Lena!

01:18:49.992 --> 01:18:51.277
Kostas!

01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:52.762
Lena!

01:18:56.465 --> 01:18:57.883
He makes you drunk.

01:18:58.083 --> 01:18:59.502
It was nothing.

01:18:59.702 --> 01:19:00.336
We were

01:19:00.536 --> 01:19:01.337
just dancing!

01:19:02.171 --> 01:19:03.873
You make
promise to me.

01:19:04.073 --> 01:19:07.543
Does that mean nothing
to you, too, huh?

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:10.012
Does not mean nothing to break

01:19:10.212 --> 01:19:12.481
the hearts of
those who love you?

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:27.096
You call that... nothing?

01:19:28.564 --> 01:19:31.400
I'm sorry.

01:19:33.903 --> 01:19:36.039
In this life,

01:19:36.239 --> 01:19:39.843
family is the most
precious gift

01:19:40.043 --> 01:19:42.478
we are given...

01:19:42.678 --> 01:19:44.914
the most sacred.

01:19:45.114 --> 01:19:47.651
Turn your back on them,

01:19:47.851 --> 01:19:51.554
and that is when
you truly have nothing.

01:20:04.367 --> 01:20:06.469
* *

01:20:10.806 --> 01:20:15.078
It happened just how
I always imagined it would,

01:20:15.278 --> 01:20:17.546
so why do I feel this way,
Lena?

01:20:17.746 --> 01:20:18.882
How can something

01:20:19.082 --> 01:20:21.084
that's supposed
to make you feel so complete

01:20:21.284 --> 01:20:24.420
end up leaving you so empty?

01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:29.358
I just wish so much
I could talk to my mom.

01:20:29.558 --> 01:20:34.563
I need her...
and that scares me.

01:20:46.575 --> 01:20:48.244
Mom, I... I told you

01:20:48.444 --> 01:20:50.013
I can't baby-sit today...
Bailey and I have an inter...

01:20:50.213 --> 01:20:51.580
Bailey's in the hospital,
sweetheart.

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:52.682
Her mom called.

01:20:52.882 --> 01:20:55.851
Honey, she's...
she's not doing well.

01:20:56.051 --> 01:20:57.053
Oh.

01:20:57.253 --> 01:20:58.738
It's Bethesda
Memorial.

01:20:58.938 --> 01:21:00.223
I tried
calling you.

01:21:00.423 --> 01:21:03.126
Come on, I'll-I'll-I'll
drive you over to see her.

01:21:03.326 --> 01:21:04.393
That's okay,
I'll, um...

01:21:05.261 --> 01:21:08.464
I'll go by there if I...
if I have time.

01:21:15.204 --> 01:21:16.906
MAN
But, I mean, if you're, like,

01:21:17.106 --> 01:21:19.042
shooting squirrels
or something like...

01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:22.545
I am mad at my dad.

01:21:22.745 --> 01:21:24.881
I am mad... at my dad.

01:21:25.081 --> 01:21:27.350
Why is that so hard
for me to say, Tibby?

01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:30.619
I have no problem
being mad at you.

01:21:30.819 --> 01:21:31.754
I noticed.

01:21:33.622 --> 01:21:34.557
I'm sorry.

01:21:34.757 --> 01:21:35.825
I'm so sorry, Tibby.

01:21:36.025 --> 01:21:38.227
What I said...
it was not nice.

01:21:38.427 --> 01:21:41.997
It was... it was
awful, and I'm sorry.

01:21:42.197 --> 01:21:45.768
Well, maybe sometimes
it's easier to be...

01:21:45.968 --> 01:21:47.236
mad at the people
you trust.

01:21:47.436 --> 01:21:49.538
Why? Why? Why is that?

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:52.275
'Cause you know they'll
always love you, no matter what.

01:21:53.709 --> 01:21:54.710
Hmm?

01:21:58.347 --> 01:22:02.518
Well, your mom told me
about your friend Bailey.

01:22:02.718 --> 01:22:05.989
Yeah. Bailey.

01:22:07.190 --> 01:22:09.325
Yeah. She's not
really my friend.

01:22:09.525 --> 01:22:11.460
Well, you know, I mean, yeah...

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:14.864
yeah, a little,
but, you know, she's 12.

01:22:15.064 --> 01:22:17.266
Your letters...
they made her sound like, um...

01:22:17.466 --> 01:22:18.334
Oh, she drives you crazy.

01:22:18.534 --> 01:22:20.269
I mean, we'll be doing
interviews, right,

01:22:20.469 --> 01:22:21.237
talking to people,

01:22:21.437 --> 01:22:23.006
and she'll just jump in
out of nowhere

01:22:23.206 --> 01:22:24.407
and start asking
these questions.

01:22:24.607 --> 01:22:27.226
She just asks them anything
she wants about their lives

01:22:27.426 --> 01:22:30.046
like she's trying to get
to know them or something.

01:22:30.246 --> 01:22:31.047
Well, is she going

01:22:31.247 --> 01:22:33.566
to be okay?

01:22:33.766 --> 01:22:36.085
I don't know.

01:22:41.624 --> 01:22:44.227
I don't know.

01:23:02.045 --> 01:23:05.114
* *

01:23:15.724 --> 01:23:16.826
Papou!

01:23:17.026 --> 01:23:19.195
I need to say
something to you.

01:23:19.395 --> 01:23:21.097
You can pretend that
you don't understand me,

01:23:21.297 --> 01:23:22.298
but I know you do.

01:23:24.467 --> 01:23:27.270
People have always said
to me that I...

01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:28.804
that I take after Yia Yia,

01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:31.607
that I have her
face and her smile,

01:23:31.807 --> 01:23:34.210
but what no one
ever sees is that...

01:23:34.410 --> 01:23:39.148
there's this whole other part
of me that is just like you:

01:23:39.348 --> 01:23:42.085
quiet and... and stubborn

01:23:42.285 --> 01:23:44.654
and afraid of
showing too much.

01:23:44.854 --> 01:23:47.023
And then I met someone
who changed

01:23:47.223 --> 01:23:49.292
everything, and he
showed me that I can

01:23:49.492 --> 01:23:50.526
take a chance, even if it's

01:23:50.726 --> 01:23:51.760
only for a moment.
Lena.

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:52.928
Shh!

01:23:54.263 --> 01:23:55.331
You had
that same moment once,

01:23:55.531 --> 01:23:57.100
when you met Yia Yia

01:23:57.300 --> 01:23:58.501
and you risked everything
for it.

01:23:58.701 --> 01:24:01.036
That was your chance,
Papou, and I'm asking

01:24:01.236 --> 01:24:04.507
now to have mine.

01:24:13.949 --> 01:24:16.435
Go.

01:24:16.635 --> 01:24:18.922
* *

01:24:19.122 --> 01:24:23.726
* If I could take you away *

01:24:26.262 --> 01:24:30.733
* Pretend I was queen *

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.739
* What would you say? *

01:24:38.006 --> 01:24:41.477
* Would you think I'm unreal *

01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:49.752
* 'Cause everybody's got
their way I should feel *

01:24:51.019 --> 01:24:55.558
* And everybody's talking how
I can't, can't be your love... *

01:24:55.758 --> 01:24:56.692
Kostas!

01:24:56.892 --> 01:24:59.094
* But I want, want, want
to be your love... *

01:24:59.294 --> 01:25:00.163
Kostas!

01:25:00.363 --> 01:25:02.731
* Want to be your love
for real *

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:07.770
* Everybody's talking how
I can't, can't be your love *

01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:11.106
* But I want, want, want
to be your love *

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:14.877
* Want to be your love
for real *

01:25:15.844 --> 01:25:21.217
* Everything will be
all right... *

01:25:28.857 --> 01:25:31.260
I thought I'd never
see you again.

01:25:32.094 --> 01:25:33.662
I love you.

01:25:33.862 --> 01:25:37.666
* And everybody's talking how
I can't, can't be your love *

01:25:37.866 --> 01:25:40.869
* But I want, want, want
to be your love *

01:25:41.069 --> 01:25:44.207
* Want to be your love
for real *

01:25:45.208 --> 01:25:49.745
* Everybody's talking how
I can't, can't be your love *

01:25:49.945 --> 01:25:52.748
* But I want, want, want
to be your love *

01:25:52.948 --> 01:25:56.819
* Want to be your love
for real. *

01:26:32.221 --> 01:26:33.456
We need to get
this box style...

01:26:34.457 --> 01:26:36.392
Be right back.

01:26:38.193 --> 01:26:39.828
Hello.

01:26:40.829 --> 01:26:43.732
Hello?

01:26:43.932 --> 01:26:47.270
Dad? It's Carmen.

01:26:47.470 --> 01:26:49.605
Um...

01:26:49.805 --> 01:26:51.707
I'm glad you called.

01:26:51.907 --> 01:26:53.308
Um...

01:26:53.508 --> 01:26:54.643
I just...

01:26:54.843 --> 01:26:55.778
I want...

01:26:55.978 --> 01:26:57.863
It's-It's all right;
you-you don't...

01:26:58.063 --> 01:26:59.948
you don't have to apologize,
sweetheart.

01:27:00.148 --> 01:27:02.718
You were... upset. I know.

01:27:02.918 --> 01:27:05.488
Um, no, Dad,
you don't know.

01:27:05.688 --> 01:27:06.622
That's just it.

01:27:06.822 --> 01:27:07.556
You've never known,

01:27:07.756 --> 01:27:10.426
because I've never
been able to tell you.

01:27:10.626 --> 01:27:12.828
T-T-Tell me what?

01:27:13.028 --> 01:27:14.963
That I'm angry with you, Dad.

01:27:15.163 --> 01:27:18.934
This entire thing about you
and Lydia and, and the kids...

01:27:19.134 --> 01:27:20.035
It's my fault.

01:27:20.235 --> 01:27:25.374
I-I... I should've told you
about them... before,

01:27:25.574 --> 01:27:26.675
and I'm-I'm... I'm sorry.

01:27:26.875 --> 01:27:28.977
Yeah, you should've warned me,
but it's more than that.

01:27:29.177 --> 01:27:30.179
It's... It's the fact

01:27:30.379 --> 01:27:32.748
that you've found
yourself this new family,

01:27:32.948 --> 01:27:35.184
and I feel like some outsider

01:27:35.384 --> 01:27:37.920
who doesn't even
belong to you anymore.

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:40.589
It's like you
traded me and Mom in

01:27:40.789 --> 01:27:44.427
for something that you
thought was better,

01:27:44.627 --> 01:27:46.395
and I want to know why.

01:27:46.595 --> 01:27:48.180
Are you ashamed of me?

01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:49.765
Are you embarrassed?

01:27:49.965 --> 01:27:54.069
Just tell me, Dad,
what did I do wrong?

01:27:55.871 --> 01:27:57.206
Why did you leave?

01:27:57.406 --> 01:27:58.541
Why did you have to go

01:27:58.741 --> 01:28:02.411
and then tell me
that we were going to be closer,

01:28:02.611 --> 01:28:05.280
but that never happened?

01:28:06.214 --> 01:28:10.619
Dad, why does Paul visit
his alcoholic dad every month,

01:28:10.819 --> 01:28:14.590
but you only visit me
twice a year?

01:28:18.894 --> 01:28:21.280
And I know
you-you just seem so happy

01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:23.666
about being Paul
and Krista's dad,

01:28:23.866 --> 01:28:26.369
but you never even had
the time to be mine.

01:28:27.169 --> 01:28:28.871
I'm sorry.

01:28:31.139 --> 01:28:32.508
I'm-I'm so sorry.

01:28:32.708 --> 01:28:35.978
I wish that were enough, Dad.

01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:57.333
Where's your little friend
these days?

01:28:57.533 --> 01:29:01.136
Kind of got used
to having her hanging around.

01:29:01.970 --> 01:29:04.272
Couple of weeks ago,
she saw I was having

01:29:04.472 --> 01:29:05.741
a bad time of it...

01:29:05.941 --> 01:29:08.311
asked me
if I wanted to talk.

01:29:08.511 --> 01:29:11.747
She's kind of special
that way, huh?

01:29:21.757 --> 01:29:23.158
Dear Tibby,

01:29:23.358 --> 01:29:25.628
my heart is too full
to write about it just now,

01:29:25.828 --> 01:29:28.564
and you won't believe
I'm saying this,

01:29:28.764 --> 01:29:31.400
but I really think
the pants did bring this to me.

01:29:32.267 --> 01:29:34.102
We were right all along, Tibby.

01:29:34.302 --> 01:29:35.170
The pants are magic.

01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:37.406
And I know
that if you let them,

01:29:37.606 --> 01:29:39.307
they'll bring you some, too.

01:29:39.507 --> 01:29:42.578
All my love. Lena.

01:29:51.887 --> 01:29:54.590
* *

01:30:03.131 --> 01:30:06.134
* *

01:30:16.545 --> 01:30:19.815
* *

01:30:25.287 --> 01:30:28.757
It's about time you showed up.

01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:34.129
What's, uh, what's that?

01:30:34.329 --> 01:30:37.099
That's Dragon's Lair.

01:30:38.667 --> 01:30:42.320
Brian came by yesterday
and dropped it off.

01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:46.174
He said it wasn't as good
as the real thing,

01:30:46.374 --> 01:30:48.911
but at least
it'd keep me practicing.

01:30:50.312 --> 01:30:51.446
He helped me get

01:30:51.646 --> 01:30:52.581
to level ten...

01:30:52.781 --> 01:30:55.083
the one where the castle's
under siege.

01:30:55.283 --> 01:30:57.853
That's cool.

01:31:00.689 --> 01:31:03.659
He's a pretty decent guy,
Brian is.

01:31:04.527 --> 01:31:06.529
Yeah, he is.

01:31:06.729 --> 01:31:11.333
Oh, man, you were right,
and I was wrong,

01:31:11.533 --> 01:31:16.138
but I'm... I'm wrong
about most people, so...

01:31:17.139 --> 01:31:20.509
The important thing is...

01:31:21.343 --> 01:31:24.813
...you always change
your mind about 'em.

01:31:28.951 --> 01:31:30.919
I brought
something for you.

01:31:33.288 --> 01:31:35.458
* Ta-da! *

01:31:35.658 --> 01:31:37.560
The traveling pants.

01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:42.097
Yeah. I just... I just got 'em
back from Lena.

01:31:42.297 --> 01:31:43.832
The one in Greece?

01:31:44.032 --> 01:31:47.169
Yeah, um... she said
that we were right all along,

01:31:47.369 --> 01:31:48.971
that they
really are magic, and...

01:31:49.171 --> 01:31:52.374
I don't know the details,
but I do know Lena,

01:31:52.574 --> 01:31:55.778
and for her to say that
means that, um...

01:31:55.978 --> 01:31:58.847
that it must be true.

01:32:02.317 --> 01:32:03.652
So I-I was thinking,

01:32:03.852 --> 01:32:06.989
you know, maybe you could,
um, have them for awhile.

01:32:07.923 --> 01:32:10.525
They didn't fit me, remember?

01:32:10.725 --> 01:32:11.459
Yeah, I know.

01:32:12.294 --> 01:32:16.064
I know, but that doesn't
really matter.

01:32:16.264 --> 01:32:16.932
You know.

01:32:17.132 --> 01:32:20.135
None of it
really matters.

01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:27.542
Listen, you-you have
to take them, Bailey.

01:32:27.742 --> 01:32:31.747
Okay? You have to
let them help you.

01:32:34.016 --> 01:32:36.018
Please.

01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:40.689
I know that you're
tired, okay,

01:32:40.889 --> 01:32:42.525
but you can't
give up.

01:32:42.725 --> 01:32:44.476
These pants will give you
a miracle.

01:32:44.676 --> 01:32:46.428
You-You just...
you have to believe.

01:32:46.628 --> 01:32:48.563
Tibby...

01:32:48.763 --> 01:32:50.499
the pants

01:32:50.699 --> 01:32:53.902
have already worked
their magic on me.

01:32:55.570 --> 01:32:58.774
They brought me to you.

01:33:10.585 --> 01:33:15.991
I want... you
to do something for me.

01:33:18.393 --> 01:33:20.595
What?

01:33:22.264 --> 01:33:25.267
Finish your movie.

01:33:27.535 --> 01:33:30.005
Why?

01:33:31.273 --> 01:33:34.276
Because you can.

01:33:56.164 --> 01:33:57.800
Hello.

01:34:02.838 --> 01:34:05.307
I'll let her know.

01:34:29.331 --> 01:34:31.934
Painted the porch.

01:34:33.869 --> 01:34:36.739
Say, what do you say
we go to Mario's

01:34:36.939 --> 01:34:39.007
to celebrate
your homecoming?

01:34:39.207 --> 01:34:40.408
Maybe later, Dad.

01:34:40.608 --> 01:34:43.812
I'm pretty tired
from the trip.

01:34:54.356 --> 01:34:57.926
* *

01:35:06.835 --> 01:35:09.437
* *

01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:27.089
Hey, it's me, Bailey.

01:35:27.289 --> 01:35:29.958
You don't have to use this
in your movie or anything,

01:35:30.158 --> 01:35:32.060
although now
that I think of it,

01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:36.381
fainting in Wallmans does
kind of qualify me as a loser.

01:35:36.581 --> 01:35:40.702
But then again, wearing
a price sticker on your forehead

01:35:40.902 --> 01:35:43.338
probably makes you one, too.

01:35:43.538 --> 01:35:45.774
You know, I don't know, Tibby.

01:35:45.974 --> 01:35:48.576
Maybe the truth is
there's a little bit of loser

01:35:48.776 --> 01:35:50.312
in all of us, you know?

01:35:50.512 --> 01:35:52.447
Being happy isn't
having everything

01:35:52.647 --> 01:35:54.016
in your life be perfect.

01:35:54.216 --> 01:35:56.751
Maybe it's about
stringing together

01:35:56.951 --> 01:35:58.887
all the little things...

01:35:59.087 --> 01:36:00.823
like wearing these pants or...

01:36:01.023 --> 01:36:03.959
getting to a new level
of Dragon's Lair...

01:36:04.159 --> 01:36:08.897
making those count for more
than the bad stuff.

01:36:09.097 --> 01:36:11.433
Maybe we just get through it...

01:36:11.633 --> 01:36:13.969
and that's all we can ask for.

01:36:40.495 --> 01:36:43.131
* *

01:36:43.331 --> 01:36:44.882
* We went to church *

01:36:45.082 --> 01:36:47.026
* Praying Santa Maria *

01:36:47.226 --> 01:36:49.399
* Send me guidance *

01:36:49.599 --> 01:36:51.773
* Send me guidance... *

01:36:51.973 --> 01:36:52.875
Hello.

01:36:53.075 --> 01:36:54.142
Carmen, it's Lena.

01:36:54.342 --> 01:36:55.777
I-I have to talk
to you about something.

01:36:56.611 --> 01:36:58.313
Hey, don't you answer
your phone anymore?

01:36:58.513 --> 01:36:59.781
Carmen, I really
don't have time...

01:36:59.981 --> 01:37:03.018
Tib, Bridget
needs us.

01:37:05.888 --> 01:37:07.906
Shh...

01:37:08.106 --> 01:37:10.125
What?

01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:13.461
Hey!

01:37:13.661 --> 01:37:16.231
See? I told you the smell of
junk food would wake her up.

01:37:16.431 --> 01:37:19.834
We have invited ourselves over
for a sleep-over.

01:37:20.034 --> 01:37:23.738
But it seems you are
already... asleep.

01:37:23.938 --> 01:37:24.773
Yeah.

01:37:24.973 --> 01:37:27.275
I feel so tired.

01:37:28.143 --> 01:37:31.579
Well, then...
you should talk to us,

01:37:31.779 --> 01:37:34.716
so that we...

01:37:35.850 --> 01:37:37.820
...can fix this.

01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:41.389
This is the
perfect pizza.

01:37:41.589 --> 01:37:42.257
It's the bacon.

01:37:42.457 --> 01:37:43.458
I think it's the olives.

01:37:43.658 --> 01:37:44.226
The bacon.

01:37:44.426 --> 01:37:46.594
Honestly, you two.
Maggie! What...

01:37:46.794 --> 01:37:47.795
Maggie, no!

01:37:47.995 --> 01:37:48.897
Hey.

01:37:49.097 --> 01:37:51.599
You know who would
have loved this, B?

01:37:51.799 --> 01:37:53.100
Your mom.

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:54.402
Yeah.

01:37:54.602 --> 01:37:57.372
I remember this one time,
she decided that, um,

01:37:57.572 --> 01:37:59.123
that she'd make one herself.

01:37:59.323 --> 01:38:00.650
She always
woke up starving

01:38:00.850 --> 01:38:01.977
after one of
her episodes.

01:38:02.177 --> 01:38:04.012
I was just sitting
in the kitchen

01:38:04.212 --> 01:38:05.680
doing my homework, and...

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:08.282
she just walked in and just...

01:38:08.482 --> 01:38:10.251
started making this... thing.

01:38:10.451 --> 01:38:12.069
You know, I
don't even know

01:38:12.269 --> 01:38:13.688
if you could
call it a pizza.

01:38:13.888 --> 01:38:16.290
It was more like
the entire contents

01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:18.893
of our refrigerator
on a round crust.

01:38:20.662 --> 01:38:22.063
Craziest part is,

01:38:22.263 --> 01:38:23.481
we actually ate it.

01:38:23.681 --> 01:38:24.899
'Course you did.

01:38:25.099 --> 01:38:25.868
We ate

01:38:26.068 --> 01:38:27.502
every single bit
of that pizza

01:38:27.702 --> 01:38:28.636
in, like, ten minutes.

01:38:28.836 --> 01:38:29.972
Yeah.

01:38:30.172 --> 01:38:32.507
And we were laughing
the whole time.

01:38:32.707 --> 01:38:34.109
It was great.

01:38:34.309 --> 01:38:36.411
I remember
thinking that

01:38:36.611 --> 01:38:39.181
maybe there won't be
any more bad spells,

01:38:39.381 --> 01:38:40.782
maybe she'll
just be happy

01:38:40.982 --> 01:38:43.418
like this forever.

01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:48.223
It's okay to miss her, B.

01:38:48.423 --> 01:38:51.576
I mean, as hard as it is
to be sad about it,

01:38:51.776 --> 01:38:54.929
don't you think maybe
it's harder not to be?

01:38:55.129 --> 01:38:57.265
You don't understand.

01:39:00.435 --> 01:39:02.104
Bridge...

01:39:02.304 --> 01:39:05.808
I can't.

01:39:06.008 --> 01:39:08.410
It hurts too much.

01:39:08.610 --> 01:39:09.311
I know.

01:39:09.511 --> 01:39:10.946
No, you don't know.

01:39:11.146 --> 01:39:16.151
You just want to feel good
and happy and alive.

01:39:16.351 --> 01:39:18.486
'Cause...

01:39:18.686 --> 01:39:21.156
if I feel alive...

01:39:21.356 --> 01:39:24.392
it doesn't seem
like she's dead.

01:39:26.261 --> 01:39:28.130
And...
if I'm not sad,

01:39:28.330 --> 01:39:32.517
then... it proves
that I'm not like her.

01:39:32.717 --> 01:39:36.704
You don't have to prove that
to anybody.

01:39:36.904 --> 01:39:41.209
I mean, you have a strength
in you that your mom never had.

01:39:41.409 --> 01:39:45.280
As much as she wanted to,
she couldn't find it.

01:39:48.016 --> 01:39:51.019
And you have
something else, too.

01:39:51.219 --> 01:39:53.088
What?

01:39:54.522 --> 01:39:57.359
You have us.

01:39:58.726 --> 01:40:02.397
We're not gonna let
you go anywhere, okay?

01:40:02.597 --> 01:40:04.783
Thank you.

01:40:04.983 --> 01:40:07.169
Come here.

01:40:24.586 --> 01:40:26.654
Come back.

01:40:27.689 --> 01:40:29.924
Bye.

01:40:38.933 --> 01:40:41.403
Miss you, too.

01:40:51.779 --> 01:40:53.381
No, Maggie.

01:40:57.018 --> 01:40:58.820
Maggie!

01:40:59.654 --> 01:41:00.755
Mag-gie!

01:41:00.955 --> 01:41:01.856
Morning.

01:41:02.056 --> 01:41:03.791
Get back here, now!

01:41:03.991 --> 01:41:04.893
I mean it.

01:41:05.093 --> 01:41:06.561
Maggie! Excuse me.

01:41:06.761 --> 01:41:08.563
Maggs!

01:41:08.763 --> 01:41:10.565
Sorry.

01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:14.702
Maggie.

01:41:20.842 --> 01:41:22.710
Did you lose these?

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:24.279
Um...

01:41:24.479 --> 01:41:27.982
yeah, I, uh, think I did.

01:41:28.182 --> 01:41:29.918
Thanks.
Yeah.

01:41:30.118 --> 01:41:33.705
So, um, what are
you doing here?

01:41:33.905 --> 01:41:37.292
I was looking for you,
actually.

01:41:37.492 --> 01:41:40.728
Oh, yeah, we're on
Hobart Place, not Street.

01:41:40.928 --> 01:41:41.929
It's really confusing.

01:41:42.129 --> 01:41:43.131
Yeah, that would do it.

01:41:43.331 --> 01:41:45.067
That would do it.

01:41:45.267 --> 01:41:48.370
So I'm on my way
back to Columbia.

01:41:48.570 --> 01:41:50.822
It's not exactly nearby.

01:41:51.022 --> 01:41:53.275
No, it's not exactly nearby.

01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:58.380
I just want to say
that what happened between us...

01:41:58.580 --> 01:42:00.482
was my fault.

01:42:00.682 --> 01:42:02.717
Your fault?

01:42:02.917 --> 01:42:04.752
Not fault.

01:42:04.952 --> 01:42:06.054
My responsibility.

01:42:06.254 --> 01:42:07.589
I should've known better.
It's just...

01:42:07.789 --> 01:42:10.725
Well, I didn't exactly
tell you to slow down.

01:42:10.925 --> 01:42:12.294
Problem is...

01:42:12.494 --> 01:42:15.397
I wanted it for all
the wrong reasons.

01:42:15.597 --> 01:42:16.999
And all the things

01:42:17.199 --> 01:42:19.401
that I was trying
to run away from

01:42:19.601 --> 01:42:23.305
just ended up catching up
with me that much sooner.

01:42:27.642 --> 01:42:30.795
Anyway, friends.

01:42:30.995 --> 01:42:34.148
Hey, friends.

01:42:37.819 --> 01:42:39.754
Mm... when you're 20

01:42:39.954 --> 01:42:42.957
and, um, probably
a soccer star

01:42:43.157 --> 01:42:44.426
at some huge college

01:42:44.626 --> 01:42:47.145
and there's a million guys
after you,

01:42:47.345 --> 01:42:49.864
promise me
you'll give me a shot.

01:42:50.898 --> 01:42:53.435
Deal.

01:42:53.635 --> 01:42:55.637
All right.

01:43:01.175 --> 01:43:02.376
Thank you.

01:43:02.576 --> 01:43:04.078
Take care.

01:43:04.278 --> 01:43:05.780
You, too.

01:43:19.327 --> 01:43:20.895
Oh...

01:43:21.095 --> 01:43:22.464
My...

01:43:22.664 --> 01:43:23.865
Oh, my God.

01:43:24.065 --> 01:43:25.049
Lena, look at you.

01:43:25.249 --> 01:43:26.034
You're all here.

01:43:26.234 --> 01:43:28.236
I missed you so much.

01:43:28.436 --> 01:43:30.238
B, I am so sorry.

01:43:30.438 --> 01:43:32.807
When I found your letter,
I tried to come sooner.

01:43:33.007 --> 01:43:33.875
Do you forgive me?

01:43:34.075 --> 01:43:36.244
Forgive you?
Who the hell are you?

01:43:36.444 --> 01:43:38.162
Hey, I wasn't sure
I'd see you here.

01:43:38.362 --> 01:43:40.081
I thought maybe
you'd change your mind

01:43:40.281 --> 01:43:41.082
about your
dad's wedding.

01:43:41.282 --> 01:43:42.217
Nope.

01:43:42.417 --> 01:43:43.868
Which is why we decided
we'd change it for her.

01:43:44.068 --> 01:43:45.520
Yeah, Carmen,
how about a little road trip?

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:46.821
What are you talking about?

01:43:47.021 --> 01:43:48.156
Come on...
No!

01:43:48.356 --> 01:43:49.491
No, no...

01:43:50.792 --> 01:43:52.160
It's your father's wedding.
Carmen, stop.

01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:53.895
Don't you think it's important
for you to be there?

01:43:54.095 --> 01:43:55.430
Absolutely.
Lena, if it was that important,

01:43:55.630 --> 01:43:56.598
then my dad would
pick up the phone

01:43:56.798 --> 01:43:57.499
and tell me that himself.

01:43:57.699 --> 01:43:58.900
Well, maybe
he's still recovering

01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:00.102
from the last conversation
you had.

01:44:00.302 --> 01:44:01.703
I'm not sure that was
entirely helpful, Tibby.

01:44:01.903 --> 01:44:03.305
I'm just saying,
you know, parents screw up.

01:44:03.505 --> 01:44:04.489
It's what they're good at.

01:44:04.689 --> 01:44:05.473
And it's up to us

01:44:05.673 --> 01:44:06.908
to see the things
that they can't.

01:44:07.108 --> 01:44:08.776
Yeah, well, he's going to
throw me out of the wedding.

01:44:08.976 --> 01:44:10.412
He's not going to throw
you out of the wedding.

01:44:10.612 --> 01:44:11.729
No, he's not.
That's so overdramatic.

01:44:11.929 --> 01:44:13.047
And if he does, we'll
be there for you.

01:44:13.247 --> 01:44:14.015
Don't worry about it.

01:44:14.215 --> 01:44:15.350
What aren't you guys
understanding?

01:44:15.550 --> 01:44:16.835
I am not going...
Let's go.

01:44:17.035 --> 01:44:18.320
You are going
to this wedding!

01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:21.589
* *

01:44:21.789 --> 01:44:23.824
So this is the view
from my window.

01:44:24.024 --> 01:44:25.860
And these
are my cousins' donkeys.

01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:28.696
This is George and George Jr.

01:44:28.896 --> 01:44:30.615
My grandparents,
caldera.

01:44:30.815 --> 01:44:32.534
Oh, God,
forget the caldera.

01:44:32.734 --> 01:44:33.568
I want to see the guy.

01:44:33.768 --> 01:44:34.402
Yeah, where's the boy?

01:44:34.602 --> 01:44:35.920
I'm sneaking in the back

01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:37.239
once the ceremony begins.

01:44:37.439 --> 01:44:39.073
You know the caldera's
actually the top of a volcano...

01:44:39.273 --> 01:44:40.408
Okay, Lena...

01:44:40.608 --> 01:44:43.144
Once the ceremony's
done, we're leaving.

01:44:43.344 --> 01:44:44.078
Look.
We're not hanging around.

01:44:44.278 --> 01:44:45.179
Oh, my God.

01:44:45.379 --> 01:44:46.564
Lena!
I know.

01:44:46.764 --> 01:44:47.749
Isn't he gorgeous?

01:44:47.949 --> 01:44:49.451
I was referring to
you holding a fish.

01:44:49.651 --> 01:44:50.485
Oh, you know what?
Hey, hey.

01:44:50.685 --> 01:44:52.019
Hey, no fair
attacking the driver.

01:44:52.219 --> 01:44:53.020
Stop. Oh, my gosh.

01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:54.238
Is it fair to
bribe the driver

01:44:54.438 --> 01:44:55.457
to turn around
and go back home?

01:44:55.657 --> 01:44:56.691
Oh, yeah, with what money,

01:44:56.891 --> 01:44:58.326
'cause Tibby is the only one
of us working this summer.

01:44:58.526 --> 01:44:59.561
Hey, hey, hey.

01:44:59.761 --> 01:45:00.895
I actually stocked my
last shelf at Wallmans.

01:45:01.095 --> 01:45:02.297
Thank you very much.
Congratulations.

01:45:02.497 --> 01:45:03.598
Wait, so does this mean
there's going to be

01:45:03.798 --> 01:45:04.599
a ceremonial burning
of the smock?

01:45:04.799 --> 01:45:06.468
No, no. Actually,
Duncan took the smock.

01:45:06.668 --> 01:45:07.802
But I do have
my name tag.

01:45:08.002 --> 01:45:09.036
Can we burn it?

01:45:10.338 --> 01:45:12.673
Hey, how did your suck-umentary
turn out?

01:45:12.873 --> 01:45:15.209
Uh... uh...
well, it actually evolved

01:45:15.409 --> 01:45:16.511
into something quite different

01:45:16.711 --> 01:45:18.146
than I expected, so...

01:45:18.346 --> 01:45:19.781
What are you going
to call it?

01:45:20.815 --> 01:45:22.550
Mm...

01:45:22.750 --> 01:45:24.286
"Bailey."

01:45:24.486 --> 01:45:26.554
* It's all right *

01:45:26.754 --> 01:45:29.240
* Run with me, dream with me *

01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:31.726
* Play with me, call on me *

01:45:31.926 --> 01:45:38.099
* Whenever you need me,
I'll be by your side *

01:45:38.299 --> 01:45:41.302
* As sure as
the sun's gonna rise... *

01:45:43.204 --> 01:45:44.856
Carmabelle, come on.

01:45:45.056 --> 01:45:46.708
We're going to be late.

01:45:47.542 --> 01:45:49.577
What is she doing in there?

01:45:50.378 --> 01:45:51.313
Carmen?

01:45:51.513 --> 01:45:53.247
I changed my mind, guys.

01:45:53.447 --> 01:45:54.365
I can't do this.

01:45:54.565 --> 01:45:55.283
Yes, you can.

01:45:55.483 --> 01:45:57.519
No, Lena, I can't.

01:45:59.353 --> 01:46:00.255
Carmen?

01:46:00.455 --> 01:46:01.523
What?
Carmen, please come out.

01:46:01.723 --> 01:46:03.891
I promise you,
everything's going to be okay.

01:46:04.091 --> 01:46:06.093
B, how do you know that?

01:46:08.129 --> 01:46:09.864
'Cause of what I'm holding.

01:46:11.899 --> 01:46:13.034
Wear them.

01:46:13.234 --> 01:46:14.969
They'll make you brave.

01:46:15.169 --> 01:46:18.305
B, I can't wear a pair
of jeans to a wedding.

01:46:18.505 --> 01:46:20.307
And besides,
your week isn't up.

01:46:20.507 --> 01:46:22.143
Well, rule number 11:

01:46:22.343 --> 01:46:23.795
In the event
of an emergency,

01:46:23.995 --> 01:46:25.447
the pants will
automatically go

01:46:25.647 --> 01:46:26.648
to the sister in need,

01:46:26.848 --> 01:46:29.183
regardless of
the schedule.

01:46:29.383 --> 01:46:31.235
B, there is no
rule number 11.

01:46:31.435 --> 01:46:33.287
Well, I think
there should be.

01:46:33.487 --> 01:46:34.505
And I'm invoking it now.

01:46:34.705 --> 01:46:35.523
Yeah, that sounds like

01:46:35.723 --> 01:46:36.924
a really good rule to me,
actually.

01:46:37.124 --> 01:46:37.792
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

01:46:37.992 --> 01:46:39.694
So, um,

01:46:39.894 --> 01:46:41.212
are you going to
put them on yourself,

01:46:41.412 --> 01:46:42.730
are we going to have
to do it for you?

01:46:56.343 --> 01:46:58.813
Come on.

01:47:32.647 --> 01:47:36.217
* *

01:47:45.893 --> 01:47:48.062
* *

01:47:50.532 --> 01:47:51.666
Dearly beloved,

01:47:51.866 --> 01:47:54.536
we are assembled here
in the presence of God

01:47:54.736 --> 01:47:55.837
and these witnesses

01:47:56.037 --> 01:47:59.340
to celebrate the joining
of this man and this woman

01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:01.242
in the unity of marriage.

01:48:01.442 --> 01:48:03.745
Um, sorry, could you
hold that thought...

01:48:03.945 --> 01:48:05.613
for one minute?

01:48:05.813 --> 01:48:08.082
I'm sorry.

01:48:11.719 --> 01:48:15.857
There's an important
member of our family

01:48:16.057 --> 01:48:17.992
who should be
up here with us.

01:48:23.230 --> 01:48:25.933
My daughter.

01:48:29.336 --> 01:48:31.839
Carmen?

01:48:32.039 --> 01:48:35.209
Dad, I'm not...
I'm not dressed. I...

01:48:35.409 --> 01:48:37.278
I need you.

01:49:00.668 --> 01:49:03.137
I'm sorry.

01:49:06.808 --> 01:49:08.075
I gotta get married.

01:49:08.275 --> 01:49:09.543
Okay.

01:49:10.678 --> 01:49:13.280
Sorry.

01:49:24.291 --> 01:49:25.693
You can go ahead.

01:49:27.161 --> 01:49:29.096
Dearly beloved,

01:49:29.296 --> 01:49:30.498
we are assembled here

01:49:30.698 --> 01:49:33.167
in the presence of God
and these witnesses

01:49:33.367 --> 01:49:36.838
to celebrate the joining
of this man and this woman

01:49:37.038 --> 01:49:38.773
in the unity of marriage.

01:49:39.573 --> 01:49:41.609
There are no
obligations on earth

01:49:41.809 --> 01:49:43.711
sweeter or tenderer
than those...

01:49:43.911 --> 01:49:45.613
It would be easy to say

01:49:45.813 --> 01:49:47.849
that the pants
changed everything that summer.

01:49:48.049 --> 01:49:49.216
But looking back now,

01:49:49.416 --> 01:49:53.120
I feel like our lives changed
because they had to,

01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:55.039
and that
the real magic of the pants

01:49:55.239 --> 01:49:57.833
was in bearing witness
to all of this

01:49:58.033 --> 01:50:00.428
and in somehow
holding us together

01:50:00.628 --> 01:50:05.132
when it felt like nothing
would ever be the same again.

01:50:08.069 --> 01:50:10.672
Some things never would be.

01:50:10.872 --> 01:50:13.808
But we knew now that no matter
how far we traveled

01:50:14.008 --> 01:50:15.610
on our own separate paths...

01:50:15.810 --> 01:50:18.846
Somehow we would always find
our way back to each other.

01:50:19.046 --> 01:50:22.083
And with that,
we could get through anything.

01:50:22.283 --> 01:50:23.451
To us...

01:50:23.651 --> 01:50:26.954
who we were and who we are,
and who we'll be.

01:50:27.154 --> 01:50:27.989
To the pants...

01:50:28.189 --> 01:50:29.891
And the sisterhood.

01:50:30.091 --> 01:50:33.227
And this moment
and the rest of our lives.

01:50:33.427 --> 01:50:36.898
Together and apart.

01:50:37.965 --> 01:50:41.302
* What's this life anyway? *

01:50:41.502 --> 01:50:44.572
* What's it to you and me? *

01:50:44.772 --> 01:50:47.642
* What's it to anyone? *

01:50:47.842 --> 01:50:51.112
* Who are we supposed to be? *

01:50:51.312 --> 01:50:54.516
* Make me a storybook *

01:50:54.716 --> 01:50:58.652
* And write me away from here *

01:50:58.852 --> 01:51:03.257
* I need a different now *

01:51:03.457 --> 01:51:10.064
* Where we can
wear each other for awhile *

01:51:10.264 --> 01:51:13.200
* And I'll lend you my tears *

01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:17.137
* If I could borrow your smile *

01:51:17.337 --> 01:51:21.075
* And we'll
get through tomorrow *

01:51:21.275 --> 01:51:25.646
* Some other day *

01:51:25.846 --> 01:51:30.017
* Happy after *

01:51:30.217 --> 01:51:35.890
* Once upon these days *

01:51:38.225 --> 01:51:41.061
* It's for roads to anywhere *

01:51:41.261 --> 01:51:44.381
* For ways to everything *

01:51:44.581 --> 01:51:47.609
* We were unbreakable *

01:51:47.809 --> 01:51:50.725
* We spoke our destiny *

01:51:50.925 --> 01:51:53.641
* Let's take a moment out *

01:51:53.841 --> 01:51:58.562
* Oh, and go where we never go *

01:51:58.762 --> 01:52:03.284
* Let's make a new world now *

01:52:03.484 --> 01:52:09.824
* Where we can
wear each other for awhile *

01:52:10.024 --> 01:52:13.160
* And I'll lend you my tears *

01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:17.297
* If I could borrow your smile *

01:52:17.497 --> 01:52:21.435
* And we'll
get through tomorrow *

01:52:21.635 --> 01:52:25.839
* Some other day *

01:52:26.039 --> 01:52:30.044
* Happy after *

01:52:30.244 --> 01:52:35.783
* Once upon these days *

01:52:38.853 --> 01:52:40.187
* And then one day we'll find *

01:52:40.387 --> 01:52:42.323
* When we're looking back
on this time *

01:52:42.523 --> 01:52:46.393
* Wondering how
we've come so far from this *

01:52:46.593 --> 01:52:53.868
* And when
we close our eyes... *

01:52:54.068 --> 01:52:57.037
* What's this life anyway? *

01:52:57.237 --> 01:53:00.323
* What's it to you and me? *

01:53:00.523 --> 01:53:03.410
* What are we doing here? *

01:53:03.610 --> 01:53:06.680
* And who are we
supposed to be? *

01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:10.450
* I'll take a better world *

01:53:10.650 --> 01:53:14.021
* Oh, I'll take anything *

01:53:14.221 --> 01:53:19.026
* I'll take a little more now *

01:53:19.226 --> 01:53:25.366
* Where we can
wear each other for awhile *

01:53:25.566 --> 01:53:28.736
* And I'll lend you my tears *

01:53:28.936 --> 01:53:32.656
* If I could borrow your smile *

01:53:32.856 --> 01:53:36.577
* And we'll
get through tomorrow *

01:53:36.777 --> 01:53:41.348
* Some other day *

01:53:41.548 --> 01:53:45.920
* Happy after *

01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:52.309
* Once upon these days *

01:53:52.509 --> 01:53:58.699
* Once upon these days. *

01:54:13.714 --> 01:54:15.917
* *

01:54:25.726 --> 01:54:27.929
* *

01:54:51.752 --> 01:54:53.955
* *

01:55:15.709 --> 01:55:17.911
* *

01:55:39.733 --> 01:55:41.935
* *

01:56:03.690 --> 01:56:05.692
* *

01:56:27.714 --> 01:56:29.716
* *

01:56:51.738 --> 01:56:54.007
* *
