01:11.751 --> 01:16.251
BASED ON A TRUE STORY

01:53.918 --> 01:56.293
- You're leaving now?
- Yes, it's time.

01:56.959 --> 01:58.418
Look after the kids, right?

01:58.626 --> 02:00.418
Don't let Mum
do it all by herself.

02:00.626 --> 02:03.293
Can I have your room
while you're away?

02:04.418 --> 02:07.626
- OK, but don't mess it up.
- It's already a mess.

02:11.168 --> 02:14.084
You say you're going
to walk in the mountains,

02:14.293 --> 02:16.793
but it's more like the mountain's
walking all over you!

02:17.126 --> 02:19.376
It's nothing Mum,
it's a question of habit.

02:19.584 --> 02:21.084
I put a novel in your bag.

02:21.293 --> 02:24.251
You have to read it!
I chose it because it ends well.

02:24.709 --> 02:25.751
Here.

02:26.584 --> 02:27.751
Take this as well.

02:27.959 --> 02:29.793
I can't take sweets with me!

02:30.001 --> 02:32.376
Since when do you talk back to me?

02:47.626 --> 02:48.751
Goodbye, Mummy.

02:56.126 --> 02:58.001
Come on, give me the bag.

03:01.001 --> 03:02.334
Go on.

03:12.418 --> 03:14.626
Samy, we're going to be late,
my boy.

03:38.584 --> 03:41.793
<i>THE CLIMB</i>

04:30.209 --> 04:31.959
Don't you want me
to wait for you?

04:32.168 --> 04:34.918
It's OK, I'll find someone
to drop me off.

04:54.084 --> 04:55.793
Try to go all the way
this time.

05:05.334 --> 05:07.251
<i>It's 6 o'clock on Radio Nomad</i>

05:07.459 --> 05:09.293
<i>and welcome to Seine-Saint-Denis,</i>

05:09.501 --> 05:11.376
<i>where all the kings of France
are buried</i>

05:11.584 --> 05:14.001
along with the dreams of
a bunch of kids from round here.

05:14.209 --> 05:17.376
We have an exceptional guest
this morning, Max!

05:17.584 --> 05:19.376
Yes, Samy,
soon to be the furthest out

05:19.543 --> 05:21.626
black guy on the planet is with us!

05:21.834 --> 05:25.418
He'll be the first guy from
the estate to climb the Himalayas.

05:25.626 --> 05:28.418
The Himalayas in Nepal,
nothing to do with the hookah bar!

05:28.668 --> 05:30.251
- Hi, Samy!
- Hi.

05:30.626 --> 05:32.209
Closer to the mic, buddy.

05:32.418 --> 05:36.001
So you're going from the highest
block in the neighbourhood

05:36.209 --> 05:37.959
to the world's highest mountain?

05:38.168 --> 05:40.376
You could have started
with block C!

05:40.793 --> 05:43.751
It does seem a bit extreme,
but I've been training.

05:43.959 --> 05:46.626
He's been walking up
15 flights of stairs for 26 years

05:46.834 --> 05:48.126
because the lift is broken!

05:48.334 --> 05:51.334
I've been taking the stairs for
a while, I can feel it in my legs.

05:51.543 --> 05:53.293
You know mount Everest
is 29,029 ft tall,

05:53.501 --> 05:57.459
which makes a 2528 floor building!
How's that for stairs?

05:57.668 --> 05:59.334
Jokes aside!

05:59.543 --> 06:01.751
That kind of trip costs a load,
right?

06:01.959 --> 06:03.459
Mittens, your 3 ton bag,

06:03.668 --> 06:05.376
is one of your cousins in there?!

06:05.584 --> 06:07.334
How did you manage?

06:07.543 --> 06:09.334
- Parents? Friends?
- Selling dope?

06:09.543 --> 06:10.584
No way.

06:11.043 --> 06:13.293
No, I'm from a modest family,
no secret.

06:13.501 --> 06:14.584
I tried banks.

06:15.293 --> 06:16.293
Banks?

06:22.793 --> 06:24.876
A Senegalese asking
to go to the mountains,

06:25.084 --> 06:26.584
they thought it was a prank.

06:26.793 --> 06:27.918
How did you manage?

06:28.793 --> 06:31.001
I went to see a sponsor
who understood me.

06:31.876 --> 06:32.876
How much?

06:33.168 --> 06:35.751
All together? 40000?

06:36.584 --> 06:37.584
38?

06:38.876 --> 06:42.209
I want to see my logo all over
your clothes, even your pants.

06:42.584 --> 06:45.293
Given the weather up there,
I won't be in my pants much.

06:46.168 --> 06:48.918
And it seems you apparently have
another sponsor?

06:49.126 --> 06:51.209
Yeah, you, Radio Nomad.

06:51.584 --> 06:54.126
We're taking you
to the rooftop of the world.

06:54.334 --> 06:57.376
We've given Samy
an unlimited mobile package

06:57.584 --> 06:59.793
so he can call us
to share his adventure.

07:00.001 --> 07:01.459
So Samy, what do you say?

07:01.668 --> 07:03.251
Thank you, Radio Nomad!

07:03.459 --> 07:04.918
Oh, he's happy!

07:05.126 --> 07:08.668
I'd like to ask you the question
everyone's asking themselves.

07:08.876 --> 07:10.418
Why are you doing this?

07:10.668 --> 07:12.959
People often say
we're good for nothing.

07:13.168 --> 07:15.043
For once I want to be good
for something.

07:15.251 --> 07:17.751
That's beautiful.
Sounds like a pop song.

07:18.168 --> 07:19.376
Isn't there something else?

07:19.751 --> 07:22.751
I'm doing it for myself,
my family, my neighbourhood,

07:22.959 --> 07:24.876
and for someone I care about.

07:26.084 --> 07:28.459
- So there's a girl!
- Max!

07:29.709 --> 07:32.084
Can we have her name?

07:34.043 --> 07:35.043
Nadia.

07:38.918 --> 07:40.418
You were supposed to pick me up.

07:40.626 --> 07:43.001
There was a problem with the car.

07:43.376 --> 07:44.709
Shall we kiss cheeks?

07:45.459 --> 07:46.959
- How are you?
- Good, and you?

07:47.251 --> 07:49.084
Are you taking me to Fouquet's?

07:49.293 --> 07:50.501
No, I'm joking.

07:50.709 --> 07:52.501
Anything but McDonald's.

07:52.709 --> 07:53.751
That would be crazy!

07:53.959 --> 07:55.709
Making me take the metro's crazy.

07:55.918 --> 07:58.334
- The car...
- Come on, you can tell me over food.

07:59.418 --> 08:01.459
Wait, you know...

08:03.834 --> 08:05.459
The guy's been trying

08:05.668 --> 08:07.626
to pick her up
every day for 6 months.

08:07.834 --> 08:10.709
Then Samira ends up asking
"haven't you noticed anything?",

08:10.918 --> 08:12.334
and what does he answer?

08:12.834 --> 08:15.043
"Did you cut your hair?", he says.

08:15.251 --> 08:17.168
Her hair is like silk, see.

08:17.376 --> 08:20.084
She answers "no",
she puts her hands on her boobs,

08:20.293 --> 08:21.918
moves them around and says

08:22.126 --> 08:23.834
"I got a boob job, mate,

08:24.043 --> 08:27.001
look well 'cause it's the last time
you're seeing them".

08:27.251 --> 08:29.293
- Can you imagine?
- That's full on.

08:30.209 --> 08:32.376
She left him standing there.

08:32.584 --> 08:35.084
The guy's been crying for 3 weeks,
she hasn't given in.

08:35.626 --> 08:36.626
The bastard.

08:36.751 --> 08:38.191
No, she hasn't given in for 3 weeks.

08:38.334 --> 08:40.501
- That's good.
- Oh, 3 weeks!

08:40.709 --> 08:42.084
We're proud of her.

08:45.043 --> 08:46.793
There's something I don't get.

08:47.293 --> 08:49.084
Is she into this guy?

08:51.001 --> 08:52.376
Of course she is!

08:54.251 --> 08:55.251
Yeah.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.293
OK, so...

09:04.084 --> 09:05.376
Good night.

09:05.876 --> 09:07.084
What are you doing?

09:07.834 --> 09:09.668
Cut it out, what are you doing?

09:09.876 --> 09:12.168
Thought you were gonna get me
with a steak?

09:12.376 --> 09:14.876
- That's hard.
- You're the one who seems hard!

09:15.084 --> 09:17.293
- You on heat or what?
- I've liked you for years.

09:17.501 --> 09:19.168
Say yes or no,
but say something!

09:19.376 --> 09:22.334
Shit, Samy,
I take guys seriously,

09:23.376 --> 09:25.543
I don't go out with just anybody!

09:26.043 --> 09:28.168
Do you wear nice lipstick
and dress up

09:28.376 --> 09:30.126
to go for dinner
with just anybody?

09:30.334 --> 09:33.126
By the way, you're beautiful tonight.

09:33.334 --> 09:35.209
We tried before, it didn't work out.

09:35.418 --> 09:37.043
We were 13! In year 9.

09:37.251 --> 09:39.334
Exactly!
What have you done since then?

09:39.543 --> 09:41.709
- I want reliability.
- I go down the job center

09:41.918 --> 09:43.668
every day looking for work!

09:43.876 --> 09:47.793
Under 25's have a hard time here.
Half of us are on the dole.

09:48.001 --> 09:49.959
- You're 26.
- Yeah, maybe...

09:50.626 --> 09:52.334
But I'm not a bad apple.

09:52.876 --> 09:56.251
If I had a bird,
I mean, a partner,

09:56.709 --> 09:59.918
it'd well motivate me
to get out of trouble.

10:00.126 --> 10:03.376
I need someone I can lean on,
not the otherway round.

10:03.584 --> 10:05.584
But I'd do anything for you.

10:05.793 --> 10:08.084
- I'd climb Mt. Everest if I had to!
- Would you?

10:09.501 --> 10:12.418
Whatever. You don't even know
how high Everest is.

10:12.626 --> 10:14.001
Of course, I do.

10:14.209 --> 10:16.418
We learned that in school,
you weren't ever there.

10:16.626 --> 10:18.626
Why do you think
you repeated year 9?

10:18.834 --> 10:21.001
You're such a stunner,
how could I concentrate?

10:21.209 --> 10:23.876
Come on, stop it, you got me.
How tall is it?

10:24.584 --> 10:26.834
Well... Everest is the highest.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.959
Yes, it is.
But that doesn't tell me how high.

10:30.168 --> 10:32.584
Give or take 500 ft,
ice melts, you know.

10:33.126 --> 10:35.293
- Give or take 5000 ft.
- I don't know,

10:35.501 --> 10:37.418
you've completely thrown me!

10:38.834 --> 10:40.834
It's 29,029 ft.

10:45.918 --> 10:47.793
It could be higher,
I'd climb it for you!

10:48.001 --> 10:50.001
Well, start by finding a job.

10:52.584 --> 10:53.876
You're right.

10:54.459 --> 10:55.501
You need proof?

10:55.709 --> 10:57.709
To know you can count
on your man?

10:58.084 --> 11:00.168
Well, I'll climb Mt. bloody Everest!

11:00.668 --> 11:02.084
I'll climb it for you,

11:02.293 --> 11:04.418
you'll see I'm no loser
and that I care.

11:04.626 --> 11:05.793
Oh, yeah?

11:06.293 --> 11:08.501
- You'd do that for me?
- Yeah, for you!

11:09.168 --> 11:10.543
I can even give you children!

11:10.751 --> 11:13.543
Climb Everest first,
then we'll see about children.

11:16.543 --> 11:17.543
Deal?

11:18.959 --> 11:19.959
Deal.

11:20.918 --> 11:22.543
A kiss of encouragement
before I go?

11:22.751 --> 11:24.168
I'm not that kissy-kissy.

11:24.376 --> 11:27.334
I'd rather have a proper snog
when you get back.

11:27.709 --> 11:29.043
If you leave.

11:38.043 --> 11:39.168
Stupid deal.

11:40.709 --> 11:44.376
<i>Good luck Samy and don't forget
to call Radio Nomad!</i>

11:44.584 --> 11:46.709
<i>Radio Nomad,
with Ben and Max!</i>

11:53.834 --> 11:55.626
- Hey, what's up?
- What's up, guys?

11:55.834 --> 11:57.084
You get kicked out or what?

11:57.293 --> 12:01.668
No, he's gonna climb mountains
and that kind of shit's hot man!

12:01.876 --> 12:03.584
- A month's walk.
- How come?

12:03.793 --> 12:05.126
I feel like changing a bit.

12:05.334 --> 12:07.709
Damn, bro'.
The only idea you've had all year

12:07.918 --> 12:09.834
is I'm gonna walk for a month.

12:10.418 --> 12:12.626
- Drop me off at the station, OK?
- Get in!

12:12.834 --> 12:14.459
Get in the other side!

12:14.668 --> 12:16.459
Get in the other side, bro'!

12:16.668 --> 12:18.918
You look like Iron Man
with that bag!

12:19.126 --> 12:21.459
What you're doing's great
for our reputation.

12:21.668 --> 12:24.043
They'll see
we're not a bunch of slackers.

12:24.251 --> 12:25.543
- Thanks.
- I respect you.

12:25.751 --> 12:28.293
Here, my pleasure,
take it, it's a gift!

12:28.501 --> 12:31.459
Smoking spliffs
at that altitude isn't advised.

12:31.668 --> 12:32.668
Seriously?

12:33.001 --> 12:35.543
This guy's nuts!
What the hell do you care,

12:35.751 --> 12:38.834
it's like traveller's cheques,
trade it any time!

12:41.584 --> 12:43.418
- See you, guys.
- Send us pics.

12:43.626 --> 12:44.793
Watch out, mate.

13:39.293 --> 13:41.751
Peter will take care of you
upon arrival.

13:41.959 --> 13:43.459
Peter's our on-site agent.

13:47.251 --> 13:48.293
Peter...

14:04.459 --> 14:06.293
- Welcome to Nepal!
- Thank you.

14:06.668 --> 14:08.293
- Are you Peter?
- Yes.

14:08.501 --> 14:10.084
- Is Peter your real name?
- No.

14:10.293 --> 14:12.918
I'm Kovinajpül-Katchpü,
if you prefer.

14:15.626 --> 14:18.584
Peter! Let's stick to Peter!
Peter's good.

14:28.543 --> 14:30.751
They were talking about you
on the radio!

14:30.959 --> 14:31.959
Whatever.

14:32.043 --> 14:34.834
I heard Samy
saying he was going to a mountain

14:35.043 --> 14:37.001
and that he went because of you.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.043
But it's not because of me!

14:39.251 --> 14:41.751
He wants to climb Mt. Everest
to get me to go out with him.

14:41.959 --> 14:43.626
No way!

14:44.168 --> 14:45.543
That's so cool!

14:45.751 --> 14:47.751
Where is it already, India?

14:47.959 --> 14:50.418
In Nepal and China.
Can't see what's so cool.

14:50.626 --> 14:52.793
I live on the 6th floor with no lift

14:53.001 --> 14:56.334
and not one guy
would come up for me, honest!

14:56.543 --> 14:58.834
But it's just talk to pick me up.

14:59.043 --> 15:01.793
Between what he says
and what he does...

15:02.001 --> 15:04.168
- No, I'd be surprised.
- I'm telling you.

15:04.376 --> 15:06.376
- He's already left.
- Really?

15:06.876 --> 15:08.876
Youssef's brother dropped him off
at the station.

15:09.084 --> 15:11.001
By this time
he's probably there already.

15:11.209 --> 15:12.834
Cut it out, you're kidding?

15:13.043 --> 15:14.959
The radio's paying
for him to call every day

15:15.168 --> 15:16.918
to tell us how it's going.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.501
So did he really go for you?

15:20.709 --> 15:22.084
That's what he said but...

15:23.084 --> 15:25.227
It's still stupid going like that,
on an impulse, right?

15:25.251 --> 15:27.793
Do you know many guys
who'd do that for you?

15:44.918 --> 15:46.376
Kathmandu!

16:08.043 --> 16:09.959
Hotel, is over there, on left.

16:12.293 --> 16:13.334
So we'll...?

16:43.459 --> 16:45.918
Are the five stars
included in the package?

16:46.251 --> 16:47.334
Actually,

16:47.543 --> 16:51.001
my sister lives in La Courneuve,
so I got you a special offer.

16:51.209 --> 16:52.543
That's kind.

17:34.959 --> 17:36.501
"My sister lives in La Courneuve."

17:38.001 --> 17:41.918
<i>So for those who like water it's
going to rain from North to South.</i>

17:42.126 --> 17:46.293
<i>We're expecting
up to 2 inches of rain...</i>

17:46.501 --> 17:49.543
<i>- Thanks for the crap news.
- Mine's better seeing</i>

17:49.751 --> 17:53.334
as Samy's on the line,
calling us live from Kathmandu.

17:53.543 --> 17:56.251
<i>- Hello Samy, can you hear me?</i>
- Yes, I hear you.

17:56.709 --> 17:59.751
<i>So you arrived in Kathmandu
a few hours ago, right?</i>

17:59.959 --> 18:01.084
Exactly.

18:02.918 --> 18:06.626
Well, tell us! Thousands of people
are listening now!

18:06.834 --> 18:10.501
Well, it's a bit of a small town,
there are temples everywhere.

18:10.709 --> 18:12.209
People are really nice.

18:12.418 --> 18:14.918
- They say "Namaste" all the time.
<i>- Namaste?</i>

18:15.168 --> 18:17.501
<i>"Namaste" means "hello"
in Nepalese!</i>

18:18.668 --> 18:21.501
<i>OK guys, get this,
our first Nepalese lesson live!</i>

18:21.709 --> 18:22.918
<i>What's it like?</i>

18:23.126 --> 18:25.918
<i>Does it smell of piss, like here?
Tell us!</i>

18:26.293 --> 18:28.459
It's pretty calm here;
not even one cop.

18:28.668 --> 18:31.751
Talking of which we have
a question from our sound tech:

18:31.959 --> 18:33.959
how's the weed in Nepal?

18:35.668 --> 18:38.209
No time for fun,
I still have stuff to buy,

18:38.418 --> 18:40.834
papers to fill out,
so I have to go now.

18:41.293 --> 18:43.293
What about tomorrow?

18:43.501 --> 18:45.584
Tomorrow I'm catching a plane
to Lukla.

18:46.751 --> 18:49.668
<i>It's at 10,000 ft.
The highest airport in the country.</i>

18:49.876 --> 18:51.543
And the most dangerous apparently.

18:51.751 --> 18:53.001
<i>Oh, maybe.</i>

18:53.209 --> 18:54.376
Then I'll have to walk.

18:54.584 --> 18:58.376
Of course, they won't just put you
on top of the peak!

18:58.584 --> 19:00.293
<i>OK, so good luck Samy,</i>

19:00.501 --> 19:02.001
<i>and send us some photos.</i>

19:02.209 --> 19:04.334
- Thanks.
<i>- 6. 15, Radio Nomad...</i>

19:20.626 --> 19:22.084
There's the job done!

20:07.168 --> 20:08.834
Put the phone number here.

20:09.168 --> 20:11.209
Person to warn
in case of an accident,

20:11.418 --> 20:13.001
to repatriate the body, OK?

20:13.209 --> 20:15.918
Are there often accidents
in the mountains?

20:16.126 --> 20:18.959
Much more than on the roads.
Know why?

20:19.168 --> 20:20.168
No.

20:20.501 --> 20:22.668
Because there are no roads!

20:30.918 --> 20:32.709
Thank you, thank you.

20:33.626 --> 20:35.126
Have a good trip, bye!

20:39.209 --> 20:41.793
They're all over the place!
This is nuts!

20:48.626 --> 20:51.626
- 7952 meters.
- Yes, impressive.

20:51.834 --> 20:54.459
That one there: Pumori,

20:54.668 --> 20:56.084
7160 meters.

21:00.959 --> 21:02.376
He disagrees.

21:04.126 --> 21:06.418
Lhotse, 8516 meters.

21:06.626 --> 21:08.126
Yes, Lhotse? Lhotse.

21:08.334 --> 21:10.751
I wanted
to do that one and then...

21:10.959 --> 21:13.293
- Difficult.
- And that one, at the back?

21:14.459 --> 21:16.126
The one that, um?

21:22.584 --> 21:24.001
Louis de Funès!

22:17.709 --> 22:18.959
I need to practice.

22:52.293 --> 22:54.251
You win, Johnny.

22:56.459 --> 22:58.418
But don't try messing with me!

22:58.876 --> 23:00.709
I'm from La Courneuve, OK?

23:01.584 --> 23:03.418
How much to carry the bag up?

23:04.751 --> 23:07.043
No, wait Johnny!

23:07.251 --> 23:08.876
Tell me how much first!

23:11.001 --> 23:12.668
Bring my damn bag back here!

23:18.126 --> 23:19.126
Namaste too.

23:42.584 --> 23:43.626
Beautiful.

23:54.793 --> 23:55.918
Are you Jeff?

23:56.543 --> 23:58.376
Samy Diakhaté.
Nice to meet you.

23:59.751 --> 24:01.376
I was sure it was you...

24:02.209 --> 24:04.043
From what I heard about you.

24:04.251 --> 24:07.209
Jeff is a professional, nice, warm.

24:10.293 --> 24:11.584
So you climbed Mt. Blanc?

24:11.793 --> 24:13.543
Mt. Blanc is still badass.

24:13.751 --> 24:16.793
Akim did it with his sister
on a field trip.

24:17.251 --> 24:18.334
Really?

24:19.376 --> 24:21.209
- Were you roped up?
- Frankly?

24:21.418 --> 24:24.293
No need, it was cool.
A health walk.

24:24.959 --> 24:27.043
- Studs?
- No studs, no ropes.

24:27.251 --> 24:29.959
All in the head!
And the weather was nice too.

24:34.418 --> 24:35.418
Kilimanjaro.

24:38.584 --> 24:41.959
It's full of crocodiles.
Fat chance he's been there.

24:43.793 --> 24:45.668
- By the North face?
- A bit of each face.

24:45.876 --> 24:49.418
Going to Kilimanjaro
gave me a taste for climbing.

24:49.626 --> 24:52.543
I was...
Especially the legs.

24:56.584 --> 24:57.793
Empty your bag.

25:01.168 --> 25:03.251
Your bag. Empty it.

25:03.876 --> 25:06.209
- Out here?
- Yes.

25:16.709 --> 25:18.626
Those are my trousers.

25:23.209 --> 25:26.209
Smecta, you need that
if your tummy hurts.

25:33.793 --> 25:34.959
For night time.

25:41.126 --> 25:42.251
Have you read this?

25:45.459 --> 25:46.584
No need to say more.

25:48.001 --> 25:50.084
My mum gave me these.

25:50.459 --> 25:53.168
She said they were good
for sugar, sport and all.

25:53.793 --> 25:54.918
Do you want one?

26:29.876 --> 26:31.001
You're missing gear.

26:32.584 --> 26:34.626
I'll write you another list.

26:35.709 --> 26:37.126
You'll buy it in Namche.

26:38.584 --> 26:40.334
We leave at 7.30 tomorrow.

26:41.293 --> 26:43.709
- Any questions?
- No, everything's great.

26:43.918 --> 26:45.959
I can't wait to get...

26:47.001 --> 26:48.168
walking.

26:55.001 --> 26:57.918
Hey, Johnny!
Does this pit-bull ever smile?

27:01.584 --> 27:02.668
Here it is.

27:05.001 --> 27:07.126
Put it there please.
Thanks.

27:08.376 --> 27:10.709
Not bad.
Yeah, put it over there,

27:11.251 --> 27:12.834
I'll put it away later.

27:16.459 --> 27:17.459
Sit down.

27:19.626 --> 27:20.626
Thank you.

27:22.334 --> 27:23.959
How much this is going to cost?

27:24.168 --> 27:25.751
We'll sort something out.

27:25.959 --> 27:27.501
But I don't have much left.

27:27.709 --> 27:29.001
And you heard him.

27:29.209 --> 27:30.959
I need equipment
and I'm not rich.

27:31.168 --> 27:32.709
OK, we'll sort it out.

27:32.918 --> 27:34.793
We'll sort it out...
Say,

27:35.001 --> 27:36.793
do you have cousins
in Morocco?

27:37.293 --> 27:38.584
Where's Morocco?

27:40.501 --> 27:41.959
Forget about it.

27:43.001 --> 27:44.918
Why are you smiling like that?

27:47.668 --> 27:48.709
What?

27:49.834 --> 27:50.918
My skin colour?

27:51.793 --> 27:53.334
You never saw a black guy?

27:53.584 --> 27:56.001
- Seriously?
- Can I touch?

27:56.709 --> 27:57.709
Yes.

28:04.918 --> 28:06.418
See, it's a bit like you.

28:07.418 --> 28:08.876
It's beautiful.

28:21.293 --> 28:22.334
It's beautiful.

29:30.584 --> 29:32.126
<i>"Jonathan didn't understand</i>

29:32.334 --> 29:35.459
<i>"why Clara had decided
never to see him again.</i>

29:36.251 --> 29:38.626
<i>"Their relationship
had lasted for years</i>

29:38.834 --> 29:42.501
<i>"and even though
it hadn't always been rose-tinted..."</i>

29:42.709 --> 29:44.251
What's up with this story?

29:44.751 --> 29:46.251
"Impossible Love."

29:46.459 --> 29:47.709
Impossible to read.

29:59.501 --> 30:01.168
That idiot really did it!

30:04.959 --> 30:06.626
Anyway, it's not over yet.

30:12.959 --> 30:14.001
I'm ready!

30:14.209 --> 30:15.251
I'm ready!

30:18.084 --> 30:19.126
Shit.

30:26.459 --> 30:27.584
Thank you.

30:33.959 --> 30:35.168
Have they left?

30:39.251 --> 30:40.543
I'll have Corn Flakes.

30:42.001 --> 30:44.293
Most of the accidents
that happen up there

30:44.501 --> 30:46.501
are often due
to lack of vigilance.

30:46.876 --> 30:48.084
So we're a group,

30:48.751 --> 30:49.751
we stay united,

30:50.626 --> 30:52.418
and everything will be fine.

30:52.876 --> 30:53.918
That's clear.

30:54.751 --> 30:58.001
My job is to get you up there,
but especially to get you all back

30:58.209 --> 30:59.584
safe and sound.

31:00.876 --> 31:02.543
I'd also like to congratulate
Emmerich

31:02.751 --> 31:04.668
for this years K2 climb.

31:09.418 --> 31:11.084
Welcome to Samy,
back from Kilimanjaro.

31:20.709 --> 31:22.043
So, time for Everest?

31:32.584 --> 31:34.001
What are you looking for?

31:34.293 --> 31:35.584
Johnny.

31:36.001 --> 31:37.043
He has my bag!

31:37.251 --> 31:39.334
Your bag left over 20 minutes ago.

31:39.543 --> 31:40.543
Seriously?

31:40.709 --> 31:42.459
The Sherpas always leave first.

31:42.668 --> 31:45.334
Without a bag
it's going to be a health walk!

31:49.043 --> 31:50.834
We'll see about that in a few days.

32:47.584 --> 32:49.209
You know that in 1953,

32:49.959 --> 32:53.001
the first man to climb Mt. Everest
was Sir Edmund Hilary.

32:53.501 --> 32:55.793
They went from Kathmandu
to Lukla on foot.

32:56.751 --> 32:59.668
- A month's hiking to get here.
- Oh shit! Lucky.

33:00.251 --> 33:03.209
Not him. Us.
Lucky they invented airplanes since!

33:03.418 --> 33:07.126
Then again, maybe there'll be
a chairlift to the top in 50 years!

33:10.709 --> 33:12.293
Alright. I'm just kidding.

33:28.459 --> 33:30.209
Are we never going to stop?

33:32.918 --> 33:35.834
I'm taking a break,
I can't take any more.

33:36.043 --> 33:38.168
I didn't sleep well,
my legs weigh a ton.

33:38.376 --> 33:41.251
We're running,
we're not even taking in the view!

33:41.793 --> 33:43.043
It's beautiful, isn't it?

33:55.793 --> 33:57.126
No, I feel better.

33:57.668 --> 33:58.751
Let's go.

34:02.793 --> 34:05.501
Didn't they learn
to make stone bridges or what?

34:16.001 --> 34:17.168
It's not too soon.

34:26.751 --> 34:28.334
What a nightmare.

34:28.543 --> 34:29.709
Bloody hell.

34:38.709 --> 34:40.543
Thank you, you're a brother.

34:40.876 --> 34:41.959
Thank you.

34:45.334 --> 34:46.376
Cool.

34:47.709 --> 34:49.251
Lucky you're here.

34:51.293 --> 34:53.584
Bloody hell, what are they on?

34:54.501 --> 34:56.084
No way! A fridge, guys?!

34:59.376 --> 35:01.793
No, not now.
Not the right time, dammit.

35:02.334 --> 35:03.543
<i>Sophie, from Radio Nomad.</i>

35:03.751 --> 35:05.418
You're on air in one minute.

35:05.626 --> 35:06.626
<i>OK.</i>

35:07.084 --> 35:09.834
<i>Hi everyone, it's 7. 10
and you're live on Radio Nomad,</i>

35:10.043 --> 35:12.584
we're about to welcome
our main man Samy...

35:12.793 --> 35:14.709
Your brother's on the radio!

35:14.918 --> 35:17.876
<i>from Seine-Saint-Denis
to the Himalayas!</i>

35:19.251 --> 35:20.501
<i>Samy boy!
Can you hear me?</i>

35:20.709 --> 35:21.959
Yeah, I can hear you.

35:22.168 --> 35:25.293
<i>Hi there! Your fan base
is growing here, you know?</i>

35:25.501 --> 35:27.584
<i>Really?
Thanks, that's nice.</i>

35:27.793 --> 35:29.793
<i>So tell us.
Where are you now?</i>

35:30.001 --> 35:31.626
We've just stopped in a village

35:31.834 --> 35:32.918
called Phadking.

35:33.126 --> 35:34.126
Hard to pronounce.

35:34.209 --> 35:36.584
There are
about ten stone houses, not more.

35:37.418 --> 35:38.543
<i>OK, cool.</i>

35:38.751 --> 35:42.126
Are you by yourself, with a group,
have you made any buddies?

35:42.584 --> 35:43.751
Have you got it on?

35:45.334 --> 35:48.251
There aren't many of us,
different nationalities,

35:48.459 --> 35:50.709
we don't all have the same level.

35:50.918 --> 35:53.376
Tell us our champion
is one of the best!

35:53.584 --> 35:54.876
These guys are good.

35:55.084 --> 35:57.209
The Australians
look like the All Blacks.

35:57.418 --> 35:59.251
<i>Not the right team, but no worries.</i>

35:59.459 --> 36:00.959
Give me 2 days
and I'll show them up!

36:01.168 --> 36:03.501
<i>- I'll be a real Sherpa.
- That's my boy!</i>

36:03.709 --> 36:04.834
<i>Scorching!</i>

36:05.043 --> 36:07.709
It's not a 100m sprint either.
And as my dad says,

36:07.918 --> 36:10.334
<i>slow and steady wins the race.</i>

36:10.543 --> 36:13.918
<i>You're gonna make me cry, but
your dad didn't invent that phrase.</i>

36:15.126 --> 36:17.584
Sorry, I've got to go,
we're off already.

36:18.001 --> 36:20.501
<i>- Good luck, we'll speak tomorrow.</i>
- Thanks, bye.

36:21.251 --> 36:23.001
Come on, guys!

36:24.959 --> 36:27.751
Come on kids,
get ready for school.

36:32.918 --> 36:35.251
Breathe, lengthen your step.

36:36.126 --> 36:38.751
Don't slump on your hips,
stay straight,

36:38.959 --> 36:40.459
get vertical.

36:42.751 --> 36:44.334
That was ultra boring.

36:44.543 --> 36:48.043
He lets out three words a minute,
no rhythm, no jokes.

36:48.251 --> 36:49.293
It's dire!

36:49.501 --> 36:50.584
No comeback, nothing.

36:50.793 --> 36:52.126
The phone lines are busy.

36:52.584 --> 36:55.043
Kids are calling in from everywhere.

36:55.251 --> 36:56.251
Really?

36:56.459 --> 36:57.876
I don't get it, why?

36:58.668 --> 37:02.001
Well, he's climbing Mt. Everest
for some girl's love.

37:06.709 --> 37:07.709
Still, 10,000 ft.

37:07.918 --> 37:10.543
<i>- How high does he want to go?</i>
- 29,029 ft.

37:10.751 --> 37:13.543
Wasn't there an easier way
to get rid of him?

37:13.751 --> 37:16.209
I didn't want that,
it was just a conversation.

37:16.418 --> 37:19.501
<i>Well, now the whole
neighbourhood knows.</i>

37:19.709 --> 37:21.959
How could I guess
he'd go on the radio?

37:22.168 --> 37:24.126
- Are you into him or not?
<i>- Well...</i>

37:24.626 --> 37:25.959
He's alright.

37:27.043 --> 37:28.209
You're into him.

37:28.834 --> 37:30.751
<i>It's no biggie, you can tell me!</i>

37:30.959 --> 37:32.626
Wait 3 weeks and you'll see.

37:32.834 --> 37:35.668
I don't just want a fling,
I want to get it right.

37:35.876 --> 37:37.418
They're all dicks anyway.

37:39.209 --> 37:40.209
Gotta go.

37:40.376 --> 37:41.709
Hey honey, it's me.

37:42.126 --> 37:43.918
- Where's your brother?
- At football.

37:44.126 --> 37:46.459
- And what are you up to?
- Revising.

37:46.668 --> 37:47.793
Good girl.

37:48.751 --> 37:51.334
Tell me, have you heard
from your friend Samy?

37:53.751 --> 37:54.751
Who?

37:56.584 --> 37:59.501
Samy Diakhaté,
your childhood friend

37:59.709 --> 38:01.209
who's in the Himalayas.

38:03.209 --> 38:06.626
Don't take me for a fool,
everybody's listening to the radio.

38:06.834 --> 38:08.084
I haven't heard anything.

38:08.293 --> 38:11.334
I don't know if he's really doing it
for you, but he's brave.

38:12.376 --> 38:13.501
I like him.

38:50.793 --> 38:52.209
Where are you going?

38:52.418 --> 38:55.834
I'm going to get some equipment.

38:56.959 --> 38:58.251
And my bag?

38:58.751 --> 39:00.918
Samy, concentrate on your feet!

39:02.876 --> 39:05.293
Let it pass,
this one looks stubborn.

39:05.918 --> 39:08.001
- But how can you tell?
- The eyes.

39:08.209 --> 39:09.918
Yellow eyes mean stubborn?

39:10.084 --> 39:11.751
No. It happens because of their diet.

39:11.959 --> 39:13.834
Back home, it's red eyes.

39:15.418 --> 39:17.834
- Red?
- Because of the weed.

39:42.751 --> 39:43.793
Oh, damn.

39:51.043 --> 39:53.209
So "donyeba"
means thank you?

39:53.459 --> 39:57.126
I don't know about "donyeba",
but "dhanyabhad" means thank you.

40:03.209 --> 40:05.501
The gear they had back then
is a joke.

40:05.709 --> 40:08.168
They look like the chimney sweeps
from Mary Poppins.

40:09.376 --> 40:10.626
That's harsh.

40:15.126 --> 40:16.959
They make me sick, seriously!

40:19.084 --> 40:21.876
- They carry stuff like that all day?
- Yes.

40:27.751 --> 40:29.668
You should eat
your sandwiches up.

40:29.876 --> 40:31.126
No, really, I'm good.

40:31.834 --> 40:33.209
Just a bit of tea.

40:36.459 --> 40:37.501
Namas-tea.

40:54.793 --> 40:56.126
The bastard! Jeff!

41:50.001 --> 41:51.043
Namche.

42:08.251 --> 42:09.876
Thank you, Johnny.

42:12.959 --> 42:14.334
You've got them all.

42:14.543 --> 42:16.168
Do you even know who he is?

42:16.376 --> 42:17.418
Johnny Hallyday.

42:19.001 --> 42:20.043
"Johnny Lallyday."

42:20.459 --> 42:21.709
Do you know his songs?

42:22.543 --> 42:24.584
- How about the t-shirt?
- A French guy,

42:24.793 --> 42:26.043
he stayed here.

42:26.251 --> 42:27.834
He became a monk.

42:28.251 --> 42:29.293
No shit?

42:29.501 --> 42:32.876
- He gave me all his t-shirts.
- And gave everything up?

42:34.209 --> 42:35.793
And this?
What's the story?

42:36.668 --> 42:38.668
You won't like it, honest.
Let it go.

42:39.834 --> 42:41.126
- Love story?
- Yes,

42:41.334 --> 42:44.084
but you see,
it says "Impossible Amour".

42:46.459 --> 42:47.793
Can you read it to me?

42:49.626 --> 42:51.168
OK, I'll read it to you.

42:51.376 --> 42:53.459
But first,
we have to buy some kit.

42:53.668 --> 42:55.959
Jeff gave me his list
and you know he's...

43:01.376 --> 43:02.543
"Johnny Lallyday."

43:05.459 --> 43:06.459
We'll sort it out.

43:06.626 --> 43:09.626
We'll sort it out,
but don't forget I'm paying.

43:10.418 --> 43:13.418
You're a laugh,
the poles already cost me a lot.

43:17.126 --> 43:18.834
You're shopping too!

43:20.084 --> 43:21.959
- Studs.
- Yes, studs.

43:29.376 --> 43:31.501
No need to sort things out
to take money.

43:43.126 --> 43:45.209
Oh, crap,
hooligans are all I need.

43:53.209 --> 43:54.668
I'll stick to the tea.

44:00.126 --> 44:02.001
And a tea.

44:03.293 --> 44:05.209
- Are you from Paris?
- Yes, I am.

44:05.418 --> 44:06.418
Paris Saint Germain!

44:06.626 --> 44:07.626
Exactly.

44:07.751 --> 44:10.126
You know, the PSG
doesn't run fast enough.

44:25.543 --> 44:26.793
No fears.

44:31.751 --> 44:32.918
Spread out, guys!

45:03.209 --> 45:05.543
Come on, wake up
you Spice Girls.

45:12.709 --> 45:15.334
Get your Nepalese passport
if you're on their side!

45:18.251 --> 45:21.293
If you want to piss
go over there, don't talk to me!

45:33.418 --> 45:37.168
<i>- Did you still fight well?</i>
- Oh, we stuck in there!

45:37.834 --> 45:39.626
<i>We're proud of you, mate!</i>

45:39.834 --> 45:40.876
<i>So what's next?</i>

45:41.084 --> 45:43.959
No more towns.
It's just stones from here.

45:44.168 --> 45:45.418
<i>Sounds interesting.</i>

45:45.626 --> 45:48.126
<i>So from now
it's straight to the top?</i>

45:48.334 --> 45:50.501
<i>No, tomorrow we're leaving
to base camp.</i>

45:50.709 --> 45:51.793
It's at 17,000 ft.

45:52.001 --> 45:53.501
<i>It's getting serious.</i>

45:53.709 --> 45:56.376
Frankly, I never thought
I'd go so high up.

45:56.959 --> 45:58.959
<i>Since you've been gone,
our listeners have tripled.</i>

45:59.043 --> 46:01.876
<i>You have fans all over France,
it's crazy.</i>

46:02.084 --> 46:04.584
<i>People are listening to you
instead of going to work.</i>

46:04.793 --> 46:07.584
<i>That said, no one
has ever really worked here.</i>

46:07.834 --> 46:10.251
<i>- Take care of yourself.</i>
- Don't worry.

46:11.459 --> 46:12.501
I'm in control.

46:13.168 --> 46:14.418
Bye, guys!

46:57.584 --> 47:00.751
Oh shit, it's Mt. Everest,
it's Mt. Everest!

47:00.959 --> 47:02.334
No, it's Mt. Lhotse.

47:02.543 --> 47:04.126
- Mt. Lho...?
- Mt. Lhotse.

47:04.334 --> 47:05.959
- Mt. Lho...
- Mt. Lhotse.

47:06.168 --> 47:08.793
- 27,940 ft.
- Of course, Mt. Lhotse.

47:09.251 --> 47:11.876
- I need to stop stopping like that.
- Maybe.

47:13.918 --> 47:14.959
Beautiful, huh?

47:32.334 --> 47:33.376
Don't watch.

47:34.209 --> 47:35.293
Don't look back.

47:39.751 --> 47:41.251
Keep up the pace, Samy!

47:41.751 --> 47:43.001
Keep up the pace...

47:50.668 --> 47:51.709
Look up, Samy.

47:52.293 --> 47:53.459
Make your mind up.

47:56.209 --> 47:57.459
Look up.

48:20.959 --> 48:23.668
- He didn't even call this morning.
- I know.

48:24.709 --> 48:26.459
So you're listening in now?

48:26.668 --> 48:28.084
No, my mum told me.

48:28.293 --> 48:30.209
You're the only one here
not listening.

48:30.418 --> 48:32.418
It doesn't mean
I'm not thinking about him.

48:32.626 --> 48:34.501
I hope nothing's
happened to him.

48:35.251 --> 48:38.251
There's probably no signal,
that's all.

48:38.626 --> 48:39.668
Hello.

48:40.501 --> 48:43.626
"The phone kept ringing,
but nobody answered,

48:43.834 --> 48:47.209
"only the echo of the tone
losing itself in Clara's house.

48:47.418 --> 48:50.001
"At the other end of the line,
Jonathan cried

48:50.209 --> 48:51.876
"and couldn't hang up."

48:53.043 --> 48:54.543
Of course she's in love,

48:54.751 --> 48:57.126
she digs him,
but he doesn't know it.

48:57.334 --> 48:59.293
- He never shows.
- Shows?

48:59.501 --> 49:01.751
Like a magic show.
With rabbits.

49:01.959 --> 49:04.209
He never compliments her.

49:04.418 --> 49:07.418
Plus, he's loaded,
so he gets all the girls he wants.

49:07.626 --> 49:08.834
So Clara dumped him.

49:09.043 --> 49:12.251
Now she's the one giving him
a hard time, understand?

49:12.459 --> 49:13.459
A bit.

49:15.001 --> 49:17.543
Women are like mountains,
Johnny.

49:18.084 --> 49:19.668
You have
to be worthy of them.

49:20.543 --> 49:21.709
Understand?

49:24.334 --> 49:26.834
<i>It's 6 o'clock.
Welcome to Radio Nomad.</i>

49:27.043 --> 49:30.084
<i>You're with Ben and Max
until 9 o'clock.</i>

49:30.293 --> 49:32.293
Couldn't we say "Max and Ben"
for once?

49:32.501 --> 49:34.501
You're with Max and Ben...

49:34.709 --> 49:36.584
Hear that, mum!
It's for me!

49:36.793 --> 49:38.543
And sadly, no Samy.

49:38.751 --> 49:41.293
No, he's climbing Mt. Everest
for a girl's love.

49:42.751 --> 49:45.126
Sorry! He hasn't called
for 3 days now.

49:45.334 --> 49:47.293
Try unlocking an iPhone in mittens.

49:47.668 --> 49:49.709
<i>So he left ten days ago,</i>

49:49.918 --> 49:52.584
<i>the last time we spoke,
he'd reached 13,000 ft,</i>

49:52.793 --> 49:56.876
bringing him halfway to the top
of the highest summit in the world!

49:57.084 --> 49:59.001
<i>With a guy from the estate
on the top!</i>

49:59.209 --> 50:01.959
<i>Our answerphone
is crowded with messages.</i>

50:02.168 --> 50:03.709
We picked some out.

50:03.918 --> 50:06.709
So it's time
to give the listeners the mic.

50:07.001 --> 50:09.334
<i>Hi, it's Nedjma,
I'm from Val-d'Oise.</i>

50:09.543 --> 50:12.293
<i>If Nadia dumps you,
I'll have you whenever you like!</i>

50:12.501 --> 50:14.626
<i>I've left my picture
on the website.</i>

50:14.834 --> 50:17.709
<i>OK, Nedjma,
we'll get you his phone number!</i>

50:19.376 --> 50:20.584
What a slag.

50:24.459 --> 50:26.043
Where the hell are you?

50:42.751 --> 50:43.793
Look.

50:44.459 --> 50:45.501
Oh, yeah.

50:59.959 --> 51:01.334
From now on,

51:02.126 --> 51:03.334
one step,

51:04.001 --> 51:05.043
one breath.

51:07.626 --> 51:10.293
And above all, don't stop anymore.

51:28.168 --> 51:30.459
I get the one step, one breath thing.

51:35.959 --> 51:38.084
It's not the same air
in La Courneuve.

51:43.459 --> 51:45.543
It's Mr Diakhaté,
Samy's father!

51:46.543 --> 51:49.376
Hello, Mr Diakhaté.
I'm glad you called.

51:49.584 --> 51:51.334
Yes, I'm worried too, sir.

52:05.334 --> 52:06.668
Why are we stopping?

52:06.876 --> 52:08.251
For old friends.

52:37.876 --> 52:40.043
They took my child!

52:40.251 --> 52:42.209
They took my child!
My love!

52:43.376 --> 52:44.793
I want Samy!

52:45.043 --> 52:47.876
<i>CLIMBING EVEREST FOR LOVE:
SAMY DISAPPEARS</i>

52:49.543 --> 52:51.959
It's just headlines,
to sell their crap!

52:52.626 --> 52:55.584
Next time don't let him go,
it'll make things easier.

53:02.959 --> 53:05.543
What an idiot,
sending a Cameroonian there...

53:05.751 --> 53:07.543
Senegalese...
He's Senegalese.

53:07.751 --> 53:10.543
I want all the pictures
of my logo off the website.

53:10.751 --> 53:11.793
Got it?!

53:13.793 --> 53:15.084
<i>No, sir!</i>

53:15.293 --> 53:17.043
We can't take the pictures down.

53:17.584 --> 53:19.459
No, we can't blur them either.

53:19.751 --> 53:22.334
But because...
I can't. No!

53:22.876 --> 53:24.626
Shit, this is bad.

53:25.418 --> 53:26.584
What a mess.

53:28.334 --> 53:31.501
- Are you busy tonight?
- No.

53:35.793 --> 53:37.668
I hope you're proud of yourself!

53:37.876 --> 53:40.418
- Hello, Mrs Diakhaté.
- Don't Mrs Diakhaté me!

53:40.626 --> 53:42.959
What have you done to my son?!

53:43.168 --> 53:44.168
Calm down.

53:44.251 --> 53:46.001
It's none of your business!

53:46.209 --> 53:47.876
Why did you send him away

53:48.084 --> 53:49.626
to be killed in the mountains?

53:56.043 --> 53:58.209
...my son would still be here!

53:59.043 --> 54:00.626
If he's dead, it's your fault!

54:23.126 --> 54:24.376
What are you doing here?

54:25.209 --> 54:26.418
Where's your farmer?

54:28.626 --> 54:29.751
All by yourself?

54:31.251 --> 54:33.001
Are you the stubborn type?

54:33.459 --> 54:34.709
Let me see your eyes.

54:35.251 --> 54:37.751
Listen Chewbacca,
I've got something for you.

54:37.959 --> 54:39.001
Wait.

54:40.834 --> 54:42.459
Who's getting a sweet?

54:46.543 --> 54:48.709
You've never had one of these.

54:49.084 --> 54:50.334
Don't say no!

54:52.376 --> 54:55.793
Plus, you don't have to worry
about the dentist.

54:58.751 --> 54:59.793
Slowly.

55:01.293 --> 55:02.376
It's good, huh?

55:04.876 --> 55:06.751
See, it's good.

55:09.334 --> 55:12.793
Don't tell your friends I gave you
one or they'll be after me.

55:13.001 --> 55:14.876
Gotta go,
they're waiting for me.

55:33.043 --> 55:34.876
Look at the helicopter there!

55:35.084 --> 55:36.293
Keep up the pace!

55:36.501 --> 55:39.168
- We'll freeze at this speed!
- Each to his own pace!

55:39.376 --> 55:40.668
I wasn't born in the Alps!

55:40.876 --> 55:42.209
Stick to the path.

55:43.459 --> 55:44.751
Damn.

55:47.834 --> 55:49.126
Poor guys.

56:00.418 --> 56:02.418
I don't know the way, Jeff!

56:35.918 --> 56:38.418
<i>I want a reliable guy.</i>

56:38.626 --> 56:41.043
<i>You'll see I'm no loser
and I care about you.</i>

56:41.793 --> 56:44.001
<i>- You'd do that for me?</i>
- Nadia.

56:48.959 --> 56:50.626
What am I doing here?

56:50.834 --> 56:53.251
<i>Try to go all the way this time.</i>

56:55.751 --> 56:56.834
Nadia?

56:57.459 --> 56:58.834
<i>You'd do that for me?</i>

56:59.584 --> 57:00.834
Bloody hell.

57:02.043 --> 57:03.793
What the hell am I doing?

57:09.501 --> 57:11.001
Pull yourself together.

57:11.584 --> 57:13.918
You have to go on,
not allowed to let go.

57:14.251 --> 57:16.793
If you stop now,
they'll all laugh at you.

57:19.209 --> 57:21.418
Come on, Samy,
come on!

57:40.876 --> 57:41.918
Thanks God!

58:11.709 --> 58:13.001
Well done, Samy!

58:13.459 --> 58:15.584
Come on,
get something hot to drink.

58:19.918 --> 58:20.918
Congratulations.

58:29.168 --> 58:31.501
Sit down, you're not at the top yet.

58:37.334 --> 58:38.626
Welcome to Base Camp!

58:52.418 --> 58:54.126
I like the red logo...

58:58.543 --> 58:59.709
Hello, Radio Nomad?

58:59.918 --> 59:02.543
- Hello, it's Samy.
<i>- Oh crap, it's Samy!</i>

59:02.751 --> 59:03.918
Stay on the line!

59:04.126 --> 59:05.168
They've found him!

59:05.376 --> 59:07.084
Whatever you do,
don't hang up!

59:08.834 --> 59:10.959
Oh crap, I'm so happy!

59:11.626 --> 59:13.501
It's Samy, it's Samy!

59:14.126 --> 59:15.126
Hello Samy?

59:15.168 --> 59:16.251
I can hear you.

59:16.459 --> 59:18.668
<i>Oh god, you scared the crap
out of us!</i>

59:18.876 --> 59:21.209
You haven't called for 5 days!

59:21.418 --> 59:24.459
<i>Well guys, the package
you got me is rubbish!</i>

59:24.668 --> 59:26.501
Only satellite phones work.

59:26.709 --> 59:30.668
- Are you OK? You're not ill?
- It's really cold, but it's OK.

59:30.876 --> 59:32.834
- I'm at base camp.
<i>- So over 16,400 ft?</i>

59:33.043 --> 59:35.209
<i>- 17,600, it's crazy!</i>
- You rock mate!

59:35.418 --> 59:37.001
But keep calling us, right?

59:37.209 --> 59:39.959
I'm in the middle of nowhere.
There's no signal.

59:40.168 --> 59:41.709
I can't call you all the time.

59:41.918 --> 59:43.834
Evening is the best time.

59:44.043 --> 59:46.334
Call tomorrow evening,
we'll record it.

59:47.168 --> 59:48.876
I wanted to ask you guys...

59:49.751 --> 59:52.209
can you let my parents know
that I'm OK?

59:52.418 --> 59:54.626
- I can't really call from here.
<i>- Of course.</i>

59:54.834 --> 59:56.418
- We're on it buddy.
<i>- Thanks.</i>

59:56.626 --> 59:57.668
Ciao.

1:00:06.751 --> 1:00:08.793
- Mr Diakhaté?
<i>- Speaking.</i>

1:00:09.001 --> 1:00:11.751
<i>It's Ben from Radio Nomad,
I've heard from your son.</i>

1:00:13.501 --> 1:00:14.626
<i>Everything's fine.</i>

1:00:14.834 --> 1:00:16.084
Are you mad?

1:00:16.293 --> 1:00:17.751
I could have broken my nose!

1:00:17.959 --> 1:00:19.876
Give me your company's number.

1:00:20.084 --> 1:00:21.084
Shut up!

1:00:21.209 --> 1:00:22.293
<i>And...</i>

1:00:22.501 --> 1:00:24.251
Sorry, Mr Diakhaté?

1:00:24.459 --> 1:00:26.251
<i>No, no! Not you.</i>

1:00:26.459 --> 1:00:29.001
OK, he's fine
and I'll call you as soon as

1:00:29.209 --> 1:00:30.501
<i>we hear from him.</i>

1:00:30.709 --> 1:00:33.543
That's very kind.
Thank you so much.

1:00:41.209 --> 1:00:43.084
They've just found my son.

1:00:43.293 --> 1:00:45.126
- On Mt. Everest.
- OK...

1:00:54.293 --> 1:00:56.001
Nadia, they've found him!

1:00:56.709 --> 1:00:58.418
He's at base camp.

1:01:45.168 --> 1:01:46.626
- Hello.
- Hello.

1:01:47.251 --> 1:01:48.293
Didier.

1:01:50.543 --> 1:01:52.001
Samy. Nice to meet you.

1:01:52.209 --> 1:01:55.459
- Do I know you?
- I'm not sure... Maybe on TV?

1:01:56.834 --> 1:01:58.709
Didier Fauconnier?
The adventurer?

1:01:58.918 --> 1:02:01.084
- No way!
- I just do nature shows.

1:02:01.293 --> 1:02:03.626
You travel and get paid for it,
come on!

1:02:03.834 --> 1:02:05.709
It's still a lot of work.

1:02:05.918 --> 1:02:09.793
Living in Seine-Saint-Denis's
a lot of work and there's no pay.

1:02:10.001 --> 1:02:12.043
Yeah, I get it.

1:02:12.251 --> 1:02:14.668
Ah, let me introduce my team.

1:02:14.876 --> 1:02:17.168
Charlotte, my cameraman
and director.

1:02:17.376 --> 1:02:19.293
- Charlotte, Samy.
- Hi, Charlotte!

1:02:19.501 --> 1:02:20.543
Hi, team!

1:02:22.959 --> 1:02:26.001
- Are you here on shoot?
- I've already tried Everest twice.

1:02:26.209 --> 1:02:27.251
Third time lucky.

1:02:27.459 --> 1:02:29.793
I don't want to lose
a third one.

1:02:32.126 --> 1:02:33.668
I've been training in Argentina.

1:02:34.084 --> 1:02:35.418
How about you?

1:02:35.626 --> 1:02:37.459
Mostly Mt. St Michel.

1:02:38.709 --> 1:02:39.918
The biscuits, I guess?

1:02:40.126 --> 1:02:41.334
Three times a day.

1:02:42.043 --> 1:02:44.959
Not many people here
manage first time round.

1:02:45.168 --> 1:02:46.626
See the Australians there?

1:02:46.834 --> 1:02:49.084
They're stopping here,
they just came for a walk.

1:02:49.293 --> 1:02:52.543
That's why they were fueling
like planes?!

1:02:52.751 --> 1:02:53.751
See the Koreans?

1:02:53.918 --> 1:02:56.709
They'll probably get
to camp number 4, max.

1:02:57.209 --> 1:03:01.001
The Germans however,
are on their second try.

1:03:01.209 --> 1:03:02.834
They'll make it this time.

1:03:03.043 --> 1:03:04.418
Yeah, they're on fire.

1:03:04.918 --> 1:03:08.001
- And the English?
- They'll stop at number 2.

1:03:08.209 --> 1:03:09.959
After that
there's no more beer.

1:03:11.209 --> 1:03:13.918
The most important
is to prepare for next time.

1:03:15.043 --> 1:03:16.334
Stop right there,

1:03:16.543 --> 1:03:19.084
I don't have the luxury
to pay for a second time.

1:03:19.584 --> 1:03:21.376
Get this: a young man
from the suburbs

1:03:21.584 --> 1:03:22.918
climbs Everest for love.

1:03:24.459 --> 1:03:27.126
- You're kidding?
- He's already at 17,400 ft.

1:03:32.251 --> 1:03:33.418
OK for duty!

1:03:33.626 --> 1:03:35.626
Remember
to drink a lot of water.

1:03:35.834 --> 1:03:38.376
Well, I've been doing that
from the start.

1:03:38.584 --> 1:03:40.001
We can take him higher?

1:03:40.209 --> 1:03:41.459
For now, no problems.

1:03:41.668 --> 1:03:44.876
That's good news!
Who's going to climb Mt. Everest?

1:03:46.084 --> 1:03:48.918
- Know how to put that on?
- Come on, I'm not dumb!

1:03:49.126 --> 1:03:50.168
See you at the wall.

1:03:56.334 --> 1:03:58.751
Is the altitude making him sulky?

1:03:58.959 --> 1:04:00.168
It's nuts.

1:04:00.751 --> 1:04:03.126
I can do it.
I had the same on Mt. Kilimanjaro!

1:04:14.376 --> 1:04:15.834
I think it's broken.

1:04:16.126 --> 1:04:17.209
Funny, huh?

1:04:18.251 --> 1:04:22.584
I'm not used to this model.
It must be extra small.

1:04:25.168 --> 1:04:27.751
All by myself, look.

1:04:28.793 --> 1:04:31.709
Tell Jeff I helped you
put it on me, OK?

1:04:52.543 --> 1:04:53.543
Oh, crap!

1:04:54.043 --> 1:04:55.168
Hit and climb.

1:04:56.543 --> 1:04:59.084
But? Who do I hit?
Right to the top?

1:05:03.501 --> 1:05:04.501
Come on, Samy!

1:05:05.334 --> 1:05:06.418
It's your call.

1:05:06.626 --> 1:05:08.709
- Hit and climb.
- OK, I get it.

1:05:08.918 --> 1:05:09.959
Samy, your turn!

1:05:11.626 --> 1:05:13.376
Doesn't this ice melt?

1:05:15.584 --> 1:05:16.959
Hit and climb.

1:05:17.626 --> 1:05:18.918
Not "climb and hit"?

1:05:19.126 --> 1:05:21.459
Hit and climb.
Hit and climb.

1:05:22.334 --> 1:05:24.876
Come on,
put your hands on the wall.

1:05:25.084 --> 1:05:26.084
Go!

1:05:32.834 --> 1:05:34.209
Hit, for Christ's sake!

1:05:36.751 --> 1:05:39.001
Easier on Mt. Kilimanjaro,
was it?

1:05:51.168 --> 1:05:52.959
We haven't got all day!
Shit!

1:06:28.168 --> 1:06:29.918
I can't take it any more.

1:06:30.126 --> 1:06:32.793
If you're not ready in 3 days,
you're out of here.

1:06:33.001 --> 1:06:34.043
Bloody hell...

1:06:34.376 --> 1:06:36.751
- Now go back down.
- Which way?

1:06:36.959 --> 1:06:38.501
The way you came up, loser!

1:06:44.918 --> 1:06:46.709
Louis de Funès!

1:06:52.668 --> 1:06:53.918
Listen, Jeff.

1:06:54.126 --> 1:06:55.251
The fun's over now.

1:06:55.459 --> 1:06:58.459
This French loser
can't get up the small wall.

1:06:58.668 --> 1:07:00.668
We don't want him in our team.

1:07:00.876 --> 1:07:03.043
- He's dangerous.
- It's not your decision.

1:07:11.209 --> 1:07:12.293
Oh, no.

1:07:13.168 --> 1:07:14.459
No, no!

1:07:14.668 --> 1:07:17.251
Sorry, I'm not in the mood
to read to you.

1:07:17.459 --> 1:07:19.293
If you want, we can sort it out.

1:07:19.501 --> 1:07:20.626
It's all over.

1:07:20.959 --> 1:07:23.751
You read,
and I teach you to climb.

1:07:31.251 --> 1:07:33.293
Sure you don't have family
in Morocco?

1:07:33.709 --> 1:07:34.751
Go on, climb!

1:07:37.376 --> 1:07:39.209
That's good!
Climb upwards!

1:07:40.501 --> 1:07:42.501
Pull upwards!

1:07:42.709 --> 1:07:43.709
Careful.

1:07:44.001 --> 1:07:45.209
I'm spent.

1:07:46.209 --> 1:07:48.501
Higher, higher.

1:07:49.001 --> 1:07:50.168
Come on.

1:07:50.376 --> 1:07:51.543
Dammit, Samy!

1:07:54.584 --> 1:07:56.209
Up! Up!
Everything's up here!

1:07:56.418 --> 1:07:57.751
Hit and climb!

1:07:57.959 --> 1:08:00.043
Hit and climb!
What am I doing?

1:08:00.251 --> 1:08:03.126
- Samy, up! Pull upwards.
- I can't believe it.

1:08:04.334 --> 1:08:05.626
Come on, Samy!

1:08:06.376 --> 1:08:07.543
Come on.

1:08:17.376 --> 1:08:18.543
Was that good?

1:08:20.709 --> 1:08:22.959
What?
Didn't you see my abseiling?

1:08:28.334 --> 1:08:29.709
Hit and climb, again?

1:08:29.918 --> 1:08:32.251
Oh yeah, I hit and I climb.
Sugar!

1:08:39.543 --> 1:08:44.168
"The bad-tempered man turned
into a charming-voiced seducer.

1:08:44.376 --> 1:08:46.251
"She couldn't push him away,

1:08:46.459 --> 1:08:48.751
"especially
when he renewed his apology."

1:08:49.376 --> 1:08:50.918
It's stuck!

1:08:51.126 --> 1:08:52.584
Hit and climb!

1:08:52.793 --> 1:08:54.709
Like with a hammer.

1:08:54.918 --> 1:08:56.168
Yes, go on, climb!

1:08:59.584 --> 1:09:00.626
How about that?

1:09:01.793 --> 1:09:03.751
"Despite it all,
she raised her head..."

1:09:04.209 --> 1:09:07.209
Her mother hadn't wanted her
to be with Nico.

1:09:07.709 --> 1:09:10.251
So Cony said...
she doesn't care.

1:09:50.834 --> 1:09:53.168
So! Are we climbing Everest
or what?

1:09:55.793 --> 1:09:57.126
Hit and climb!

1:09:57.959 --> 1:09:59.084
Well done.

1:11:26.293 --> 1:11:28.959
One mistake
and you're at the bottom, OK?

1:12:57.626 --> 1:12:59.834
- I'm fond of him!
- He's so nice!

1:13:02.709 --> 1:13:03.959
Ben, Radio Nomad.

1:13:04.168 --> 1:13:06.543
Florence from Le Parisien.
We spoke on the phone.

1:13:06.751 --> 1:13:09.501
Say, this is... a lively place!

1:13:09.709 --> 1:13:11.626
Yes, especially
since the past 3 weeks!

1:13:11.834 --> 1:13:14.209
- Thank you for having me.
- Let's go.

1:13:14.418 --> 1:13:16.334
It's 8 o'clock,
welcome to the land

1:13:16.543 --> 1:13:18.418
<i>of concrete and unemployment!</i>

1:13:18.626 --> 1:13:21.876
Mountain dweller friends, welcome
to the highest radio in France!

1:13:22.084 --> 1:13:23.084
What's that accent?

1:13:23.168 --> 1:13:24.834
It's the only one I can do!

1:13:25.626 --> 1:13:29.043
Thanks to one man
from the suburbs

1:13:29.251 --> 1:13:32.501
who's been making us live a dream
for the past 23 days,

1:13:32.709 --> 1:13:36.626
since he left to climb the highest
mountain in the world, at 29,029 ft.

1:13:38.418 --> 1:13:40.293
<i>This man is called Samy Diakhaté.</i>

1:13:40.501 --> 1:13:42.876
<i>Remember the name,
it'll soon be legendary,</i>

1:13:43.084 --> 1:13:44.959
<i>siding with Usain Bolt
and Muhammad Ali.</i>

1:13:45.168 --> 1:13:47.043
<i>We recorded his call last night.</i>

1:13:47.251 --> 1:13:49.501
<i>So ladies and gentlemen,
exclusively,</i>

1:13:49.709 --> 1:13:51.293
Samy Diakhaté on Radio Nomad.

1:13:51.501 --> 1:13:53.543
The station that takes you higher!

1:13:57.459 --> 1:14:00.626
We need to reassure
our growing number of listeners.

1:14:00.834 --> 1:14:01.834
<i>How are you?</i>

1:14:01.918 --> 1:14:03.459
<i>I'm fine! Not bad.</i>

1:14:03.668 --> 1:14:05.834
<i>The last rise was tough,
but I'm fine.</i>

1:14:06.043 --> 1:14:08.918
<i>- Where exactly is our hero?
- At camp number 2.</i>

1:14:09.126 --> 1:14:11.126
<i>- At 21,300 ft.
- That's far!</i>

1:14:11.334 --> 1:14:13.043
<i>He's not even far, he's lost!</i>

1:14:13.251 --> 1:14:16.376
<i>- What's it like?
- There are 20 tents standing around.</i>

1:14:16.584 --> 1:14:17.668
<i>Is there a KFC?</i>

1:14:17.876 --> 1:14:19.668
<i>No, no chicken wings for now.</i>

1:14:19.876 --> 1:14:20.876
<i>How about supplies?</i>

1:14:21.043 --> 1:14:23.334
<i>The Sherpas bring
all our gear and food.</i>

1:14:23.543 --> 1:14:24.793
<i>They work all day and night.</i>

1:14:25.001 --> 1:14:27.959
- Where are you going?
- To get equipment.

1:14:29.959 --> 1:14:31.793
<i>They're the real heroes.</i>

1:14:32.793 --> 1:14:34.001
You're a champion.

1:14:34.209 --> 1:14:35.709
<i>What's the next stage?</i>

1:14:35.918 --> 1:14:37.709
<i>Two camps left before the top.</i>

1:14:37.918 --> 1:14:39.959
<i>By when will you be
at the top?</i>

1:14:40.168 --> 1:14:42.001
<i>I might be up there in 72 hours.</i>

1:14:42.209 --> 1:14:43.668
<i>We'll let you get some rest.</i>

1:14:43.876 --> 1:14:45.126
All right.

1:14:45.334 --> 1:14:47.168
I'd like to say hi to my family.

1:14:47.376 --> 1:14:48.793
<i>My parents, brothers...</i>

1:14:49.793 --> 1:14:52.251
<i>and especially Nadia.
If she's listening...</i>

1:14:53.418 --> 1:14:56.834
<i>And big up to everyone,
from the estate and elsewhere.</i>

1:14:57.043 --> 1:14:59.459
<i>I don't know
if I'll make it to the top,</i>

1:14:59.668 --> 1:15:01.876
<i>but if I'm here, it's thanks to you.</i>

1:15:02.084 --> 1:15:03.668
<i>We're with you, Samy.</i>

1:15:03.876 --> 1:15:05.751
OK, thanks guys.

1:15:06.168 --> 1:15:07.209
Ciao!

1:15:12.334 --> 1:15:14.043
This is insane!

1:15:14.709 --> 1:15:16.459
Where is Mt. Everest anyway?

1:15:17.001 --> 1:15:20.751
I don't know, man.
Go on, check Google Earth.

1:15:20.959 --> 1:15:22.418
Type in "Everest".

1:15:22.626 --> 1:15:24.918
It should be east.
Ever-east.

1:15:26.209 --> 1:15:27.584
Thank you, goodbye.

1:15:29.793 --> 1:15:31.543
Here, look!

1:15:36.043 --> 1:15:38.251
<i>SAMY DIAKHATHÉ'S FEAT</i>

1:15:49.459 --> 1:15:50.501
Sir?

1:15:52.084 --> 1:15:53.334
Excuse me.

1:15:54.418 --> 1:15:56.293
- That's my son!
- That's nice.

1:15:56.501 --> 1:15:58.584
It's amazing!
That's my son!

1:15:59.043 --> 1:16:00.459
That's your brother!

1:16:05.959 --> 1:16:10.043
At night the temperature
can drop to -40°C.

1:16:10.251 --> 1:16:13.001
- That's insane!
- Is that all you can say?

1:16:13.209 --> 1:16:15.543
Learn some vocabulary, bro'.

1:16:15.751 --> 1:16:17.793
Have you ever
opened a book before?

1:16:18.001 --> 1:16:20.501
Your PlayStation manual
doesn't count!

1:16:20.709 --> 1:16:21.959
He's right, you know.

1:16:22.376 --> 1:16:23.751
What do you mean?

1:17:13.293 --> 1:17:14.334
Come on, Samy,

1:17:14.793 --> 1:17:16.001
almost there.

1:17:25.626 --> 1:17:28.043
"The end to this story
that floats away too,

1:17:28.251 --> 1:17:30.168
"like a leaf on the autumn wind.

1:17:30.376 --> 1:17:31.376
"But deep down,

1:17:31.543 --> 1:17:33.501
"Clara knows that love
isn't far away.

1:17:33.709 --> 1:17:36.418
"She can feel the bud
being born again in her heart

1:17:36.626 --> 1:17:38.668
"like a flower feeling for spring."

1:17:42.793 --> 1:17:44.668
Does that mean: they see again?

1:17:45.084 --> 1:17:46.668
Of course, they will.

1:17:46.876 --> 1:17:48.251
She's mad about him.

1:17:48.459 --> 1:17:50.543
She acts all proud,
but she's in love.

1:17:50.751 --> 1:17:52.834
But you said he was a fool?

1:17:54.293 --> 1:17:57.376
Yeah, I said he was a fool.
But that was before.

1:17:57.793 --> 1:17:58.918
He's grown now.

1:18:00.043 --> 1:18:02.793
- Now, he knows what's important.
- What's that?

1:18:03.209 --> 1:18:05.084
What's important is that...

1:18:05.293 --> 1:18:07.168
before you can love someone,

1:18:07.959 --> 1:18:09.626
you have to love yourself.

1:18:13.293 --> 1:18:15.626
It means you have to stop
going up and down.

1:18:15.834 --> 1:18:18.334
Settle down, brother.
Find a girl.

1:18:18.543 --> 1:18:21.376
Take her out to dinner,
talk to her,

1:18:21.584 --> 1:18:22.751
and afterwards...

1:18:22.959 --> 1:18:24.168
No, no!

1:18:24.751 --> 1:18:27.126
- Never before marriage!
- Seriously?

1:18:27.334 --> 1:18:30.126
Well, then get married and then...

1:18:32.209 --> 1:18:33.209
Thanks.

1:18:33.334 --> 1:18:35.084
I'm the one thanking you, bro'.

1:18:35.293 --> 1:18:36.418
You've been great!

1:18:36.626 --> 1:18:38.376
We'll sort something out!

1:18:43.751 --> 1:18:46.918
Bad weather's closing in.
We have to leave now.

1:18:47.126 --> 1:18:48.126
But it's 2am!

1:18:48.293 --> 1:18:50.168
- It's now or in ten days.
- OK.

1:18:50.376 --> 1:18:51.751
So we're leaving now!

1:19:11.751 --> 1:19:13.751
One step. Two breaths.

1:19:34.626 --> 1:19:35.751
Damn, no!

1:19:37.543 --> 1:19:39.168
Jeff, my light's gone out.

1:19:39.751 --> 1:19:42.418
Your pins will get you up there,
not your light.

1:19:42.834 --> 1:19:44.876
Are you kidding?
I can't see a thing.

1:19:45.126 --> 1:19:47.668
Let the breathing guide you.
It's the same.

1:19:47.876 --> 1:19:49.959
Are you taking me
for Stevie Wonder?

1:19:50.168 --> 1:19:52.793
Stevie Wonder
never climbed mountains.

1:20:22.918 --> 1:20:23.959
How are you?

1:20:24.959 --> 1:20:26.001
Not so good.

1:20:26.209 --> 1:20:27.251
This is hard!

1:21:11.543 --> 1:21:13.084
I'm not going to make it.

1:21:15.501 --> 1:21:17.459
<i>Before we go back to the news,</i>

1:21:17.668 --> 1:21:20.001
a report on the young man
from La Courneuve.

1:21:20.209 --> 1:21:21.959
<i>His name is Samy Diakhaté,</i>

1:21:22.168 --> 1:21:24.459
<i>and he decided last month,</i>

1:21:24.668 --> 1:21:26.793
<i>with no experience,</i>

1:21:27.001 --> 1:21:30.418
<i>to take on the highest mountain
in the world: Mt. Everest.</i>

1:21:30.626 --> 1:21:33.876
<i>Today he is almost 26,300 ft up</i>

1:21:34.084 --> 1:21:36.251
<i>and is about
to make his dream come true.</i>

1:21:36.459 --> 1:21:39.126
<i>Jérôme Brière
brings us the unusual portrait</i>

1:21:39.334 --> 1:21:40.709
of this young Frenchman,

1:21:40.918 --> 1:21:44.084
<i>who's gone from the 4000 estate
to the top of the world.</i>

1:21:44.293 --> 1:21:46.543
<i>Indeed Julian,
all of Samy's friends</i>

1:21:46.751 --> 1:21:49.084
<i>are proud of the feat
he's about to achieve.</i>

1:21:49.293 --> 1:21:52.626
<i>He already had something else.
I always believed in him.</i>

1:21:55.626 --> 1:21:57.834
<i>Samy's the pride
of the neighbourhood.</i>

1:21:58.043 --> 1:22:00.001
<i>It proves we're not just losers.</i>

1:22:00.209 --> 1:22:02.001
<i>Give us a job
and we'll get it done.</i>

1:22:02.209 --> 1:22:03.668
<i>Exactly, mate.</i>

1:22:03.876 --> 1:22:06.876
<i>We're doing something.
This is our place, see.</i>

1:22:07.084 --> 1:22:08.084
<i>La Courneuve!</i>

1:22:10.126 --> 1:22:11.126
<i>That's our Samy!</i>

1:22:11.334 --> 1:22:12.709
<i>We took him to the station.</i>

1:22:12.918 --> 1:22:15.709
<i>I sponsored him
because I believed in him.</i>

1:22:15.918 --> 1:22:17.834
<i>I knew he could go to the top.</i>

1:22:18.043 --> 1:22:19.168
<i>Right away, I knew.</i>

1:22:19.376 --> 1:22:21.834
<i>Only one step left
to reach happiness,</i>

1:22:22.043 --> 1:22:24.584
<i>but the highest step by far.</i>

1:22:24.793 --> 1:22:29.043
<i>Indeed, he has entered
what alpinists call the death zone.</i>

1:22:29.251 --> 1:22:32.126
<i>The most extreme cold on the planet,</i>

1:22:32.334 --> 1:22:34.918
<i>where the oxygen is most rare.</i>

1:22:47.626 --> 1:22:48.876
Are you sleeping?

1:22:52.459 --> 1:22:53.501
Guess.

1:22:54.918 --> 1:22:56.709
The silence is worrying me.

1:23:04.959 --> 1:23:07.126
- What was that?
- An avalanche.

1:23:08.751 --> 1:23:10.084
Less worried?

1:23:12.751 --> 1:23:14.168
- Should I have a look?
- Yes.

1:23:19.709 --> 1:23:21.168
Nadia, it's me,

1:23:21.834 --> 1:23:22.876
Samy.

1:23:23.293 --> 1:23:25.168
I said I'd do anything for you.

1:23:25.834 --> 1:23:26.876
Well, here I am.

1:23:28.168 --> 1:23:30.043
I'm really out of control.

1:23:31.501 --> 1:23:33.334
I don't even like the mountains.

1:23:34.418 --> 1:23:35.626
I prefer the sea.

1:23:36.251 --> 1:23:38.334
I'd love to take you
to the seaside.

1:23:38.876 --> 1:23:41.918
To lay on a deck chair
and sip cocktails all day.

1:23:42.126 --> 1:23:43.334
Just you and me.

1:23:44.376 --> 1:23:45.459
Just you and me.

1:23:49.376 --> 1:23:52.209
I've got to go
and try to get some sleep.

1:23:54.001 --> 1:23:55.043
You know...

1:23:57.709 --> 1:23:59.751
they say
"out of sight, out of mind".

1:24:01.209 --> 1:24:02.418
It's not true.

1:24:04.584 --> 1:24:06.626
I'm just saying in case...

1:24:09.626 --> 1:24:11.334
I just wanted you to know.

1:24:13.959 --> 1:24:15.168
Lots of love.

1:24:25.543 --> 1:24:26.876
Is this your phone?

1:24:27.626 --> 1:24:28.626
Yes.

1:24:32.043 --> 1:24:34.543
Next time you want
to make a call ask me.

1:24:34.751 --> 1:24:36.293
Yeah, no, because...

1:24:38.334 --> 1:24:39.543
Will you be alright?

1:24:40.501 --> 1:24:41.543
Yes.

1:24:48.001 --> 1:24:49.043
Hello.

1:24:49.793 --> 1:24:52.043
Hello. Can we see
your parents?

1:24:52.918 --> 1:24:55.668
Hello. Come in, please.

1:24:56.334 --> 1:24:58.209
Thank you. Hello.

1:24:59.959 --> 1:25:01.459
Sorry to bother you,

1:25:01.668 --> 1:25:04.876
but my daughter
has something to say to you.

1:25:07.543 --> 1:25:09.084
I just wanted to say...

1:25:09.293 --> 1:25:12.501
that I've known Samy
since secondary school, and...

1:25:14.126 --> 1:25:15.668
I've been in...

1:25:15.876 --> 1:25:17.793
in love with him ever since.

1:25:20.043 --> 1:25:22.001
You know, it's not easy here...

1:25:22.543 --> 1:25:23.626
She's so pretty.

1:25:23.834 --> 1:25:25.501
To be in love.

1:25:25.709 --> 1:25:27.709
You have to be hard, strong.

1:25:28.459 --> 1:25:30.959
You have to keep boys
at a distance.

1:25:32.001 --> 1:25:33.918
It's not easy
to guard your feelings.

1:25:34.126 --> 1:25:36.334
I feel really strongly about Samy,

1:25:36.543 --> 1:25:38.459
but I was scared
about everything,

1:25:38.668 --> 1:25:41.418
scared he would...
discard me,

1:25:41.626 --> 1:25:44.834
wouldn't want me,
wouldn't take me seriously,

1:25:45.043 --> 1:25:46.793
about being sad.

1:25:48.293 --> 1:25:49.709
I'm sorry.

1:25:50.418 --> 1:25:51.793
And now...

1:25:52.251 --> 1:25:53.793
I'm not afraid at all,

1:25:54.001 --> 1:25:55.251
not at all,

1:25:55.459 --> 1:25:57.334
and when he comes back

1:25:57.543 --> 1:25:59.459
I want to give him all my love.

1:26:00.084 --> 1:26:01.876
I just wanted to tell you.

1:26:04.918 --> 1:26:06.251
Come here, my girl.

1:26:07.334 --> 1:26:08.376
Thank you.

1:26:10.709 --> 1:26:11.709
Thank you.

1:26:14.543 --> 1:26:16.584
No more than 5 minutes
without oxygen.

1:26:16.793 --> 1:26:18.043
Is it just the 2 of us?

1:26:18.251 --> 1:26:19.543
The Germans have left.

1:26:19.751 --> 1:26:21.418
Don't waste time, get ready.

1:26:21.626 --> 1:26:24.584
- No, I'm not coming.
- What do you mean?

1:26:25.876 --> 1:26:27.709
Dorge is going with you.

1:26:28.376 --> 1:26:29.418
But who's he?

1:26:30.168 --> 1:26:31.209
Dorge.

1:26:32.584 --> 1:26:33.626
OK, great.

1:26:34.334 --> 1:26:36.418
So I'm going to be stuck
between two pit-bulls.

1:26:36.918 --> 1:26:38.793
- Why him?
- Dorge is the only Sherpa

1:26:39.001 --> 1:26:40.751
who can get you to the top.

1:26:41.459 --> 1:26:44.168
You'll see, Mt. Blanc
will be easier after this.

1:27:02.418 --> 1:27:03.793
- Charlotte?
- Yes?

1:27:04.001 --> 1:27:06.751
In your phone
there's a number I've often called.

1:27:06.959 --> 1:27:08.918
- Yes, I saw.
- It's the radio.

1:27:09.584 --> 1:27:11.043
Can you tell them I've left?

1:27:11.334 --> 1:27:13.043
I'll tell them
you're coming back,

1:27:13.251 --> 1:27:14.459
it'll be less scary.

1:27:15.876 --> 1:27:18.126
Samy, it's not a good time,
we're late.

1:27:20.001 --> 1:27:21.043
Thank you.

1:27:41.334 --> 1:27:43.293
Please, let go of your phone.

1:27:43.501 --> 1:27:44.876
You're making me dizzy!

1:27:45.084 --> 1:27:47.084
Sorry, I don't know
what else to do.

1:27:47.293 --> 1:27:49.501
There are 10 lbs of potatoes
in the kitchen.

1:27:49.709 --> 1:27:52.376
- Should I peel all of them?
- Given your state, yes.

1:27:58.293 --> 1:27:59.334
It's dead!

1:27:59.543 --> 1:28:01.376
- You're doing this on purpose!
- No,

1:28:01.584 --> 1:28:03.084
the radio, it's dead!

1:28:03.293 --> 1:28:06.251
You're not going to leave my son
alone in the mountains!

1:28:12.959 --> 1:28:14.543
- Hello.
- Hello.

1:28:15.751 --> 1:28:17.084
Our radio's broken.

1:28:18.001 --> 1:28:19.084
Come in, please.

1:28:19.293 --> 1:28:21.459
- Hello.
- Hello, kids.

1:28:21.668 --> 1:28:24.584
Hello Nadia. Can you put
the radio on for us, please?

1:28:24.793 --> 1:28:25.876
Of course.

1:28:28.043 --> 1:28:30.293
- Come in, sit down.
- Thank you.

1:28:31.168 --> 1:28:32.209
Come on.

1:28:38.501 --> 1:28:41.251
<i>It's time to hand the mic over
to Ben and Max,</i>

1:28:41.459 --> 1:28:44.459
<i>who have set their studio up
in La Courneuve</i>

1:28:44.668 --> 1:28:48.584
<i>to follow the last hours
of Samy Diakhaté's ascent, live!</i>

1:28:48.793 --> 1:28:51.293
<i>- Can you hear me?</i>
- Yes, Richard!

1:28:51.751 --> 1:28:52.834
We hear you!

1:28:53.043 --> 1:28:56.168
We're in front
of Samy's tower block

1:28:56.376 --> 1:28:57.793
and it's crazy!

1:29:21.334 --> 1:29:22.418
Did you make it?

1:29:23.668 --> 1:29:24.709
No.

1:29:35.251 --> 1:29:36.334
Good luck.

1:30:01.959 --> 1:30:03.084
Big up to Mr Menaz!

1:30:04.626 --> 1:30:06.376
He's an important guy!

1:30:06.584 --> 1:30:09.376
Mr Menaz, you've been
a mountaineer since 1961

1:30:09.584 --> 1:30:11.293
and a Himalaya specialist!

1:30:11.501 --> 1:30:13.543
I've been there a few times, yes.

1:30:13.751 --> 1:30:17.334
<i>Samy left camp number 4
four hours ago,</i>

1:30:17.543 --> 1:30:20.626
<i>so apparently
he's off for a 3,000 ft climb.</i>

1:30:20.834 --> 1:30:25.376
<i>- Is he almost there?
- He's probably only just half way.</i>

1:30:27.959 --> 1:30:30.168
<i>What's important
isn't so much the pace,</i>

1:30:30.376 --> 1:30:31.834
<i>it's not stopping.</i>

1:30:32.043 --> 1:30:34.459
<i>Those are nice words.
Mr Menaz is wise.</i>

1:30:34.668 --> 1:30:36.084
<i>Big up to him!
Thank you.</i>

1:30:46.209 --> 1:30:47.834
Aren't the stars beautiful?

1:30:50.084 --> 1:30:51.251
The stars...

1:30:54.793 --> 1:30:56.501
What's up with you?

1:30:56.709 --> 1:30:58.168
Damn, it's beautiful.

1:30:59.918 --> 1:31:02.001
You know, my father,

1:31:03.334 --> 1:31:05.668
used to hit me with his belt
to make me carry on.

1:31:07.501 --> 1:31:08.834
He was a military man.

1:31:09.751 --> 1:31:11.084
Heart like a stone.

1:31:11.543 --> 1:31:13.918
You haven't spoken to me
in a month.

1:31:14.126 --> 1:31:16.668
Can't you wait for tonight
to tell me this?

1:31:16.876 --> 1:31:19.209
And my mother...
would plant...

1:31:20.168 --> 1:31:21.459
in the garden...

1:31:21.959 --> 1:31:23.418
We had a wheelbarrow.

1:31:23.834 --> 1:31:25.084
He's out of it.

1:31:25.959 --> 1:31:27.418
Take him back down!

1:31:27.626 --> 1:31:29.293
I don't want his body
on my hands!

1:31:29.501 --> 1:31:31.876
Plus, I'm the only black guy
for miles.

1:31:33.376 --> 1:31:34.876
We'll get you back down.

1:31:35.084 --> 1:31:36.584
We're not leaving you like this.

1:31:37.001 --> 1:31:39.459
- It'll be fine, OK?
- Nice smell of jasmine.

1:31:44.001 --> 1:31:45.876
Would you like
to call your parents?

1:31:46.084 --> 1:31:48.251
I'm sure you have loads
to talk about.

1:31:48.459 --> 1:31:49.918
You're a good son, Jeff.

1:31:50.459 --> 1:31:51.501
You're a good son.

1:31:54.043 --> 1:31:55.168
You're right.

1:32:01.459 --> 1:32:02.501
We have things...

1:32:03.209 --> 1:32:04.709
things to talk about.

1:32:07.668 --> 1:32:09.209
Go all the way, Samy.

1:32:09.793 --> 1:32:11.918
- Go all the way.
- Don't worry.

1:32:23.834 --> 1:32:26.709
We've just received a message
from Charlotte

1:32:26.918 --> 1:32:28.834
who's on site
with Didier Fauconnier,

1:32:29.043 --> 1:32:31.543
the great reporter,
who's just given up.

1:32:31.751 --> 1:32:34.543
The Germans also gave up
a few hours ago.

1:32:34.876 --> 1:32:38.001
<i>But still no news
from our main man Samy,</i>

1:32:38.209 --> 1:32:39.668
<i>but we're backing him.</i>

1:32:42.501 --> 1:32:44.043
Stop telling me "come on"!

1:32:45.543 --> 1:32:46.876
I can't go any further.

1:33:32.001 --> 1:33:33.668
The voice of wisdom.

1:33:34.626 --> 1:33:37.793
So now Samy is alone
with his Sherpa.

1:33:38.001 --> 1:33:39.751
Is that good or bad news?

1:33:40.126 --> 1:33:42.459
<i>Even with a group,
it's all in the head.</i>

1:33:42.668 --> 1:33:45.168
<i>He's probably been alone
for a few hours now.</i>

1:33:45.376 --> 1:33:48.209
<i>- Is the Sherpa always easygoing?
- Yes.</i>

1:33:48.418 --> 1:33:49.918
<i>Thank you, Mr Menaz!</i>

1:33:57.168 --> 1:33:58.209
Wait.

1:34:00.959 --> 1:34:04.251
You're making me nervous,
and I can't breathe already.

1:34:06.084 --> 1:34:07.168
What is it?

1:34:19.251 --> 1:34:21.209
There's only 15 ft left!

1:34:23.376 --> 1:34:24.376
Listen.

1:34:30.001 --> 1:34:31.918
I can't come back next year!

1:34:36.001 --> 1:34:37.834
No, dammit!

1:34:38.543 --> 1:34:39.793
Listen, bro'.

1:34:40.001 --> 1:34:41.543
Take me up, please!

1:34:44.959 --> 1:34:47.084
Come on, take me up.

1:34:52.543 --> 1:34:54.418
Take me up,
I'm begging you.

1:34:58.084 --> 1:34:59.084
Thank you, Dorge.

1:35:59.126 --> 1:36:00.168
Wait!

1:36:00.959 --> 1:36:02.959
Take a picture
or they won't believe me!

1:36:03.168 --> 1:36:04.251
Here.

1:36:06.834 --> 1:36:09.209
Shoot, it's digital bro', shoot!

1:36:40.459 --> 1:36:41.584
We did it!

1:36:46.418 --> 1:36:49.584
Charlotte has sent us something
to put on the screen.

1:36:49.793 --> 1:36:51.543
5, 4, 3...

1:37:05.126 --> 1:37:08.084
Samy's on top of the world!

1:37:08.626 --> 1:37:10.834
Seine-Saint-Denis
is at the summit!

1:37:12.459 --> 1:37:14.834
<i>The estate's at the top!</i>

1:37:30.459 --> 1:37:31.876
<i>He made it!</i>

1:38:14.251 --> 1:38:21.334
<i>ONE MONTH LATER...</i>

1:38:45.501 --> 1:38:47.209
You've got style, brother.

1:38:47.418 --> 1:38:49.543
The crazy climber.
What's up?

1:38:50.751 --> 1:38:52.293
That's insane, man.

1:38:54.376 --> 1:38:55.668
Namaste, bro'!

1:39:00.876 --> 1:39:01.918
Well done.

1:39:35.293 --> 1:39:36.959
You owe me a kiss, don't you?

1:39:38.376 --> 1:39:40.543
Don't you want us
to make a baby first?

1:40:24.126 --> 1:40:25.501
<i>On the 25th of May 2008,</i>

1:40:25.709 --> 1:40:28.668
<i>Nadir Dendoune
became the first Franco-Algerian</i>

1:40:28.876 --> 1:40:31.251
<i>to climb Mt. Everest,
arriving at 29,029 ft</i>

1:40:32.168 --> 1:40:35.334
<i>...with no experience.</i>
