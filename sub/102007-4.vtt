01:33.761 --> 01:35.319
Oh, is it because
you have been dethroned?

01:35.337 --> 01:36.744
Because they've been married
so long,

01:36.764 --> 01:38.746
they have an unfair advantage--
it's obvious.

01:38.915 --> 01:40.432
Oh, I'm pretty sure
we've been divorced

01:40.659 --> 01:42.083
longer than anyone here's
been married.

01:42.103 --> 01:44.494
Which is why
they never stood a chance.

-Mm-hmm.

01:51.761 --> 01:53.170
when you say "I do"?

01:53.339 --> 01:54.504
Forget it.

01:54.598 --> 01:57.674
You really start to learn
who someone is

01:57.693 --> 02:00.177
when you are sitting
across the table from them

02:00.270 --> 02:03.847
in a deposition
carving up your life savings.

02:03.866 --> 02:05.440
And you know
how their mind really works

02:05.459 --> 02:08.518
and how cunning and ruthless
they can be.

02:08.687 --> 02:09.962
Oh, wow.
I'm blushing.

02:10.131 --> 02:10.945
(laughter)

02:11.156 --> 02:12.522
No, but I mean,

02:12.691 --> 02:15.876
divorce has been better
than couples' therapy for us,

02:16.028 --> 02:19.045
'cause when we were together,
we were miles apart.

02:19.198 --> 02:22.366
Now we're not together,
and we've never been closer.

02:22.459 --> 02:25.202
So I think there should be
a term for it.

02:25.295 --> 02:27.037
Somebody should come up
with a term for people

02:27.130 --> 02:30.131
who are better together
not together.

02:30.225 --> 02:32.151
There is a term for that.

to put a label on it

25:38.037 --> 25:40.112
and they're not ready,
you can create a problem

25:40.206 --> 25:41.780
where there isn't one.

25:41.949 --> 25:43.857
Well, if that creates
a problem,

25:43.876 --> 25:46.860
it suggests to me
underlying conditions.

25:47.029 --> 25:50.289
The real issue is, do you feel
safe in the relationship?

25:50.383 --> 25:52.216
You can have all the fun
in the world,

25:52.385 --> 25:55.368
but if you don't feel safe,
you're never gonna be happy.

25:55.462 --> 25:57.129
So you're saying
I'm being too pushy?

25:57.223 --> 25:59.539
Hmm? What?
No, I don't think I said that.

25:59.633 --> 26:00.966
So then I should force
the issue?

26:01.135 --> 26:03.135
Not necessarily.

26:03.271 --> 26:04.303
Okay.

26:04.471 --> 26:06.480
Thank, guys.

26:12.646 --> 26:14.029
PAUL: Marjan.

26:15.575 --> 26:17.816
Marjan.

26:17.985 --> 26:19.535
Marjan.

26:25.492 --> 26:28.143
So?

26:28.162 --> 26:30.087
So?

26:30.256 --> 26:32.481
So are we gonna be visiting
your wedding registry or what?

26:32.499 --> 26:34.074
Wedding's off.

26:34.093 --> 26:36.652
What?
Oh, that's great!

26:36.821 --> 26:38.487
I-I'm sorry.
Are you sad?

26:38.505 --> 26:39.430
You're sad.

26:39.599 --> 26:41.098
<i> (somber music)</i>

26:41.267 --> 26:42.266
You broke it off?

26:42.435 --> 26:45.102
No.
He dumped me.

26:45.253 --> 26:47.938
Bet you didn't see that one
coming, Sherlock, did you?

26:48.107 --> 26:49.998
No.
No, I did not.

26:50.017 --> 26:51.834
I...
(chuckles)

26:51.852 --> 26:54.336
I guess I just never imagined
anyone letting you go.

26:54.429 --> 26:56.171
He met somebody else.

26:56.190 --> 26:57.840
Her name is Madison,

26:58.008 --> 27:01.510
and she's training
to be a periodontist.

27:01.528 --> 27:03.512
You know, I never liked
that guy,

27:03.681 --> 27:04.788
even when he was your brother.

27:05.015 --> 27:07.774
(sighs)
It's not all his fault.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.293
Eventually anybody gets tired

27:09.444 --> 27:11.353
of being a friend
with no benefits.

27:11.522 --> 27:14.114
Wait, you--you guys never...

27:14.133 --> 27:16.525
Probie.
Boundaries.

27:16.618 --> 27:20.028
He said I'd never felt a spark.

27:20.122 --> 27:23.031
He accused me of never having
been in love with him,

27:23.125 --> 27:25.309
and the truth is,
I never really thought I was

27:25.536 --> 27:26.793
until he dumped me.

27:26.962 --> 27:28.537
So wait, you--
you are in love with him?

27:28.706 --> 27:30.147
I doubt it'd feel
like my heart's

27:30.316 --> 27:31.965
literally been ripped
out of my chest if I weren't,

27:31.984 --> 27:34.026
so, yeah,
I'm in love with him.

27:35.896 --> 27:38.638
I think I have been
my whole life.

27:38.732 --> 27:41.400
How did I not see that
until it was too late?

27:41.552 --> 27:43.402
Maybe because
for the first time,

27:43.554 --> 27:45.120
you didn't feel
like you had to.

27:48.058 --> 27:50.242
You need to tell him.

27:50.336 --> 27:51.243
You can't be serious.

27:51.395 --> 27:53.228
Deadly.

27:53.397 --> 27:54.672
You cannot let that man
fly away

27:54.899 --> 27:56.231
without knowing
how you really feel.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.417
No.

27:58.585 --> 28:00.085
He made his decision.

28:00.237 --> 28:01.661
I'm not gonna show up
at his hotel room

28:01.830 --> 28:03.163
and humiliate myself.

28:03.331 --> 28:05.257
Look, it's a risk.

28:05.426 --> 28:07.167
Love hurts, Marjan.

28:07.335 --> 28:09.002
But regret...

28:09.096 --> 28:10.562
that hurts a lot more.

28:12.766 --> 28:14.692
MATEO:
I think he's right.

28:14.860 --> 28:18.270
I mean, the last thing I want
is for you to leave.

28:18.422 --> 28:19.863
But the heart wants
what it wants.

28:31.285 --> 28:33.118
Okay, you sound
a little far away, sir.

28:33.212 --> 28:34.786
<i> IMP (on phone):</i>
<i> I'm calling with Siri.</i>

28:34.880 --> 28:36.380
Okay.
What's your name?

28:36.531 --> 28:38.924
<i> IMP: Mistress says I should</i>
<i> only be referred to as Imp.</i>

28:40.127 --> 28:41.626
Okay, Imp.

28:41.721 --> 28:43.703
Um, my name is Grace.

28:43.872 --> 28:45.130
What's wrong with Mistress?

28:45.224 --> 28:47.725
<i> IMP: She was stung by a bee.</i>
<i> She's allergic.</i>

28:47.893 --> 28:49.393
<i> I think there's a hive</i>
<i> in the wall.</i>

28:49.544 --> 28:50.786
Okay.
She has an EpiPen?

28:50.804 --> 28:52.062
<i> IMP: Yeah, but she</i>
<i> was reaching for it</i>

28:52.214 --> 28:53.138
<i> when she collapsed.</i>

28:53.232 --> 28:54.398
All right, I'm gonna need you

28:54.567 --> 28:56.567
<i> to grab it for her, okay?</i>

28:56.794 --> 28:59.795
-IMP: See, that's the problem.
-(bees buzzing)

28:59.964 --> 29:02.531
I'm a little tied up right now.

29:09.823 --> 29:11.749
-(bees buzzing)
-(wheezing)

29:11.917 --> 29:13.992
Rescue 29, I have
a 40-year-old female,

29:14.161 --> 29:16.661
multiple bee stings,
possible anaphylaxis.

29:16.830 --> 29:18.981
Be advised, there may be
a hive in the wall.

29:18.999 --> 29:21.091
<i> Sir, do you know if there's</i>
<i> anyone within earshot of you?</i>

29:21.318 --> 29:23.594
No, Mistress keeps
her dungeon soundproofed.

29:23.745 --> 29:24.595
<i> GRACE (on phone):</i>
<i> I suppose it would be.</i>

29:24.764 --> 29:26.154
Is there anybody else
I can call?

29:26.173 --> 29:28.006
<i> IMP (on phone): No.</i>
<i> I'm in Mistress' basement.</i>

29:28.158 --> 29:29.992
-(coughs weakly)
-She's choking.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.326
She's trying to cough,
but air can't get in.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.662
Okay, listen, I think
her airways are closing up.

29:33.680 --> 29:35.439
Did you say
you are completely bound?

29:35.666 --> 29:36.774
There's no room for you
to wiggle free?

29:36.942 --> 29:38.834
Unfortunately, that's the point
of this position.

29:38.927 --> 29:41.503
What position
would that be exactly?

29:41.522 --> 29:43.839
Hogtie frog legs?

29:43.974 --> 29:45.173
Uh, spread eagle strappado?

29:45.267 --> 29:47.767
"Shouldering the rifle"
is the official term.

29:47.787 --> 29:50.436
GRACE: Okay. All right, Imp.
So your right arm is the one

29:50.456 --> 29:51.680
that's up above your head,
correct?

29:51.698 --> 29:53.348
-IMP: Yes.
-GRACE: And your hands.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.684
Are they touching in the back,
or is there a gap of space?

29:55.777 --> 29:56.943
-Yeah, there's some space.
<i> -GRACE: Okay.</i>

29:57.187 --> 29:59.129
Is there anything hard
or sturdy in the room

29:59.298 --> 30:01.447
that's within your reach?

30:01.467 --> 30:03.708
Not really.
My feet are bound.

30:03.861 --> 30:05.043
<i> GRACE: Really?</i>
<i> You're sure there's nothing.</i>

30:05.195 --> 30:06.211
<i> Look all around.</i>

30:06.454 --> 30:07.546
I have enough slack
to reach a couple of rods

30:07.698 --> 30:09.214
that are sticking out
of the wall.

30:09.366 --> 30:10.866
<i> GRACE: Tell me those rods</i>
<i> are pointing towards you.</i>

30:11.035 --> 30:13.051
-Yeah. Why?
-I do have an idea, Imp.

30:13.220 --> 30:15.461
<i> -It is a bit unorthodox.</i>
-Anything for Mistress.

30:15.630 --> 30:17.556
I need you to take
your shoulder

30:17.708 --> 30:19.041
and slam it
up against one of the rods

30:19.209 --> 30:20.208
and dislocate it.

30:20.377 --> 30:22.468
What?
No.

30:22.563 --> 30:23.970
I may be a masochist,
but I'm not crazy.

30:24.139 --> 30:26.064
Can't the people coming here
just untie me?

30:26.158 --> 30:27.974
Yeah, I'm afraid they're not
gonna make it in time.

30:27.993 --> 30:29.809
But if you dislocate
the shoulder,

30:29.903 --> 30:31.477
you should be able to bring
your arm up over your head

30:31.497 --> 30:32.812
to untie yourself.

30:32.832 --> 30:35.240
(wheezing)

30:35.392 --> 30:36.241
She's turning blue!

30:36.393 --> 30:37.668
Imp, you have to help her.

30:37.895 --> 30:39.652
I can't!
I'm afraid.

30:39.821 --> 30:40.745
<i> I don't come here</i>
<i> to be frightened.</i>

30:40.898 --> 30:43.674
<i> I come here to be humiliated.</i>

30:43.825 --> 30:44.991
(scoffs)

30:45.160 --> 30:47.160
Well, what a sorry excuse
for a sub.

30:47.329 --> 30:48.494
<i> IMP: I-I--what?</i>

30:48.663 --> 30:50.255
<i> GRACE: You're not worthy</i>
<i> to be making</i>

30:50.407 --> 30:52.090
this call right now, are you?

30:52.242 --> 30:54.076
Cowering like a worthless
little nub.

30:54.094 --> 30:56.094
Tell me, Imp,
what comes after beta?

30:56.246 --> 30:57.429
<i> IMP: Permission to speak,</i>
<i> Your Grace?</i>

30:57.598 --> 31:00.599
Permission denied!

31:00.751 --> 31:02.526
See, you've crossed
the wrong queen now.

31:02.695 --> 31:04.528
We both know
how pathetic you are.

31:04.679 --> 31:06.771
<i> You look at baby carrots</i>
<i> with envy.</i>

31:06.924 --> 31:08.440
You haven't earned the right...
(pounds table)

31:08.592 --> 31:09.515
To be speaking to me.

31:09.684 --> 31:11.368
<i> IMP: Please, Your Grace.</i>

31:11.519 --> 31:12.870
<i> I'll do it.</i>
<i> Is it gonna hurt?</i>

31:13.021 --> 31:14.037
Oh, like hell.

31:14.189 --> 31:16.615
And I expect a thank-you
for the pain.

31:16.709 --> 31:18.542
<i> IMP: Yes, Your Grace.</i>

31:18.693 --> 31:22.528
<i> (exciting music)</i>

31:22.548 --> 31:25.941
-(bone crunches)
-(groaning loudly in pain)

31:25.959 --> 31:32.598
<i> ♪ </i>

31:34.968 --> 31:35.893
<i> Thank you.</i>
<i> I freed myself.</i>

31:36.061 --> 31:37.302
<i> Just a minute.</i>
<i> Just a minute.</i>

31:37.396 --> 31:40.230
<i> ♪ </i>

31:40.399 --> 31:42.399
Okay, I got the EpiPen.

31:42.626 --> 31:43.942
Okay, good.
Jam it into her thigh now.

31:45.629 --> 31:47.479
(inhales deeply, wheezing)

31:47.648 --> 31:49.406
Oh! She's alive.
She's breathing.

31:49.557 --> 31:51.391
<i> Ah!</i>

31:51.559 --> 31:53.243
Thank you, Your Grace.

31:53.470 --> 31:55.153
<i> That was amazing.</i>

31:55.247 --> 31:57.956
I didn't feel a thing.

32:02.162 --> 32:04.463
"Fifty Shades of Grace."

32:08.427 --> 32:09.927
What do you say, Cap?
You need a spot?

32:10.095 --> 32:11.428
No, I'm good.

32:11.655 --> 32:12.596
But, you know,
there is something

32:12.747 --> 32:14.431
I wouldn't mind
getting off my chest.

32:14.658 --> 32:16.099
Okay.

32:16.268 --> 32:19.102
So the other night,
when we were all together,

32:19.271 --> 32:23.106
how did Gwyn seem?

32:23.333 --> 32:26.610
Well, hell, uh, Owen, I don't--

32:26.779 --> 32:28.278
She seemed fine.
I don't really know the lady.

32:28.447 --> 32:29.446
Well, I do know the lady,

32:29.615 --> 32:31.097
and I can tell you,
she was fine.

32:31.116 --> 32:33.341
In fact, she was better
than fine.

32:33.510 --> 32:35.786
And I would say, collectively,
over the last couple months,

32:35.988 --> 32:39.181
we have had more good days
than we had

32:39.199 --> 32:43.109
over the entire ten years
of our marriage.

32:43.128 --> 32:46.112
And I think it's because
none of this was planned.

32:46.131 --> 32:49.858
She was gonna come down here,
stay for a week or two.

32:50.027 --> 32:52.694
We didn't know that we'd be
quarantining together.

32:52.713 --> 32:55.363
We didn't know that we would
start having...

32:55.532 --> 32:57.215
(whispering)
The best sex--

32:57.367 --> 32:58.958
All right, I-I get the picture.

32:59.127 --> 33:02.128
(normal voice)
And that was the beauty of it.

33:02.297 --> 33:03.722
You know?
The spontaneity.

33:03.874 --> 33:05.373
You know, nobody had
any expectations.

33:05.425 --> 33:06.966
And now...

33:07.060 --> 33:10.470
Now she wants to define
what this is.

33:10.638 --> 33:12.564
And you don't want to do that?

33:12.733 --> 33:13.973
Every time I put a label
on something,

33:13.993 --> 33:16.234
it ends up being
an expiration date.

33:16.386 --> 33:19.054
I don't want to ruin it,
you know?

33:19.223 --> 33:21.740
(laughs)

33:21.892 --> 33:23.908
I do.

33:24.061 --> 33:27.579
You want the cream
without having to buy the cow.

33:27.731 --> 33:29.080
No.
I didn't say that.

33:29.174 --> 33:30.323
I want the cow.

33:30.567 --> 33:33.993
But I'm not really thrilled
with this metaphor.

33:34.162 --> 33:35.512
I mean, you can call it
whatever you like to,

33:35.663 --> 33:37.330
but what I'm seeing is,
you get all the benefits

33:37.499 --> 33:38.590
with none of the commitment.

33:38.742 --> 33:39.591
What are you talking about?

33:39.760 --> 33:40.851
I'm the one who asked her
to stay.

33:41.002 --> 33:42.668
And she's the one
who left everything.

33:42.763 --> 33:44.021
It's not like she joined
a cult.

33:44.172 --> 33:45.981
It's all out there still.

33:48.101 --> 33:49.601
-(scoffs)
-I mean, I guess I can see

33:49.695 --> 33:53.104
why she might not feel
100% secure.

33:53.273 --> 33:54.364
"Secure."

33:54.591 --> 33:56.775
So is that your word,
or is that hers?

33:56.869 --> 33:58.684
No, I think
the word she used was "safe,"

33:58.853 --> 34:00.945
but she was speaking
theoretically.

34:01.114 --> 34:02.855
Mm-hmm.

34:03.024 --> 34:04.374
Hey, look...

34:04.526 --> 34:05.525
you love her?

34:05.693 --> 34:07.878
I never stopped loving her.

34:08.029 --> 34:08.879
She knows that.

34:09.030 --> 34:09.880
Yeah, but does she?

34:10.165 --> 34:11.289
Does she, though?
That's what I'm saying.

34:11.383 --> 34:14.051
Like, I-I would walk
through fire

34:14.219 --> 34:16.219
so that Grace knows I love her.

34:16.371 --> 34:17.962
She knows I love
being married to her.

34:18.057 --> 34:20.615
Right?
So that she knows she's safe.
