00:25.955 --> 00:27.943
All that from overnight?

00:28.091 --> 00:29.945
All that from Freamon.
He's out early today

00:30.094 --> 00:31.925
rooting through empties.

00:32.996 --> 00:35.017
You know what he is?

00:35.164 --> 00:37.451
He is a vandal.

00:37.599 --> 00:39.386
He is vandalizing
the board.

00:39.535 --> 00:42.023
He is vandalizing this unit.

00:42.170 --> 00:44.258
He is a Hun,

00:44.407 --> 00:47.162
a Visigoth,
a barbarian at the gate,

00:47.310 --> 00:48.830
clamoring for noble
Roman blood

00:48.977 --> 00:51.832
and what's left
of our clearance rate.

00:51.981 --> 00:54.068
And you sit here
doing what exactly?

00:54.216 --> 00:56.371
A hot shot, maybe.
I got a sack in the box,

00:56.518 --> 00:58.907
says he owns one from a couple days ago.
White Coat Alley.

00:59.055 --> 01:01.841
What the fuck is wrong
with you people?

01:01.989 --> 01:03.877
Is everybody on a crusade

01:04.024 --> 01:05.878
to make more murders
out of bullshit?

01:06.026 --> 01:07.480
The mope's
confessing, Jay.

01:07.629 --> 01:09.916
He walked up to
the Western desk to do it.

01:10.065 --> 01:13.420
Well, at least when you
go to manufacturing a murder, Eddie,

01:13.568 --> 01:15.456
you already have
a suspect in hand.

01:15.604 --> 01:17.664
I respect that part
of your game.

01:18.741 --> 01:20.361
Oh, that others might learn.

01:20.510 --> 01:23.398
I need a witness for the statement
in box number one.

01:23.544 --> 01:25.199
Yeah. Let me dump
my shit.

01:25.346 --> 01:27.178
I'll be there.

01:30.585 --> 01:32.739
Sodium cyanide.

01:32.888 --> 01:35.108
You're telling me, if we do a full
tox screen on this kid,

01:35.256 --> 01:37.243
he comes back
positive for cyanide?

01:37.391 --> 01:41.347
Yeah. That's what
I'm saying, okay?

01:41.496 --> 01:43.417
You need to lock me up

01:43.564 --> 01:45.618
because I killed that boy,
I did.

01:45.767 --> 01:47.486
I did it.
I did it.

01:47.634 --> 01:49.287
So just-- just lock me up

01:49.436 --> 01:51.623
and be done with it,
all right?

01:51.771 --> 01:53.262
Where'd you get the cyanide?

01:59.013 --> 02:01.902
You getting
sick there, Bunky?

02:02.049 --> 02:04.040
When's the last time
you had your medicine?

02:05.854 --> 02:10.108
No. No, I'm not
getting high anymore, okay?

02:10.256 --> 02:12.144
Let me ask you again:

02:12.293 --> 02:14.046
Where'd you get cyanide from?

02:14.195 --> 02:16.249
If you're saying--

02:16.396 --> 02:19.052
- Fuck!
- I'm sorry.

02:19.200 --> 02:22.487
- Shit. He got my fucking sleeve.
- Just calm down.

02:22.635 --> 02:23.889
We'll get something
to clean this up,

02:24.037 --> 02:25.424
and maybe a soda
or something.

02:25.572 --> 02:28.599
- Get some sugar in you at least.
- I'm sorry.

02:30.911 --> 02:32.430
He settles down,
I'll Miranda.

02:32.578 --> 02:34.569
Yeah.

02:37.849 --> 02:39.511
Fuck.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.787
Steals like
my ex-wife's lawyer.

03:21.092 --> 03:23.186
Jesus.

03:24.196 --> 03:25.281
Get up there.

03:25.429 --> 03:27.727
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Give me a sec!

03:45.783 --> 03:48.878
Call 911. The mutt in box one
just tried to hang himself.

05:37.724 --> 05:40.614
No idea on this one.

05:40.762 --> 05:43.617
Two on this block
and three off Lanvale.

05:43.765 --> 05:46.152
- Hmm.
- They cluster.

05:46.300 --> 05:48.792
And when they found a block they liked,
they came back on it.

05:50.538 --> 05:53.527
One on the next block,
across Gilmore.

05:53.675 --> 05:54.896
That makes nine.

05:55.043 --> 05:58.032
Scary thing is we're only
looking at one district.

05:58.180 --> 06:01.668
Shit. One sector.

06:01.816 --> 06:03.750
How far you think
they might have roamed?

06:06.355 --> 06:08.982
There's only one way
to find out.

06:13.194 --> 06:15.815
Excuse me. Daniels.

06:15.963 --> 06:17.584
How we doing with Forensics?

06:17.733 --> 06:20.887
That's the colonel's domain,
but my understanding is

06:21.035 --> 06:23.622
that we're sending
a lab team to every house.

06:23.769 --> 06:26.592
So far we're finding
9-millimeter casings.

06:26.739 --> 06:28.327
Once they start scoping
at the morgues,

06:28.475 --> 06:30.396
we'll probably have slugs
to go with them.

06:30.544 --> 06:33.832
Tracewise, we're laser-printing
around every body

06:33.981 --> 06:36.269
and vacuuming every crime scene
for hair and fiber,

06:36.417 --> 06:38.351
but, of course,
these are vacants.

06:39.987 --> 06:43.477
It'll take our lab a year
to sift that many bags of dirt.

06:43.624 --> 06:46.711
- Is this all from one drug crew?
- Probably.

06:46.860 --> 06:49.547
- Marlo Stanfield's bunch.
- Where are we on them?

06:49.696 --> 06:52.217
Major Crimes was working wiretaps
until three months ago,

06:52.365 --> 06:56.522
- but we came down on those.
- Can we get backup?

06:56.670 --> 06:59.924
Trying, but Stanfield's people
may have changed up the pattern.

07:00.073 --> 07:03.702
Well, Colonel,
whatever you need.

07:05.445 --> 07:07.066
Actually,
what I need is Patrol.

07:07.215 --> 07:08.733
Patrol Division?

07:08.880 --> 07:10.400
That was Detective Freamon
on the phone.

07:10.549 --> 07:13.337
We found two more at Lafayette
and another on Lanvale.

07:13.486 --> 07:15.373
Jesus Christ.

07:15.521 --> 07:18.009
Now starting at the first scene,
we've been going door to door,

07:18.158 --> 07:20.878
but there's no telling
how far the shooter wandered.

07:21.027 --> 07:22.880
And with 15,000 vacants
in the city,

07:23.029 --> 07:26.294
it'll take my people weeks
to cover that ground.

07:31.604 --> 07:35.827
He brings this case in,
he'll be closer to the throne.

07:35.975 --> 07:38.129
Look, I wouldn't worry
about Daniels.

07:38.277 --> 07:40.966
He's a long way
from my chair,

07:41.113 --> 07:43.300
as are you.

07:43.449 --> 07:46.680
You made your move
too soon.

07:49.121 --> 07:51.910
- I did.
- Politics doesn't suit you.

07:52.057 --> 07:54.011
Stick to operations.

07:54.157 --> 07:58.025
And don't you ever
cross me like that again.

08:02.934 --> 08:04.629
Get it out
to all the bulletins.

08:06.739 --> 08:08.793
Leander, go downtown.

08:08.940 --> 08:10.495
Run a flier
for every roll call.

08:10.643 --> 08:13.931
Show them the nails
and the screws in detail. All right?

08:14.079 --> 08:16.801
You grab a couple of those nails
and hit all the hardware stores.

08:16.949 --> 08:19.102
Find out exactly what the model is
that we're looking for.

08:19.250 --> 08:22.172
- What do you need from me?
- Herc.

08:22.319 --> 08:24.413
I'm serious.
Get hold of him.

08:30.028 --> 08:32.416
- How's he looking?
- Pretty good, considering.

08:32.563 --> 08:34.828
No worse than before
he hung himself.

08:36.701 --> 08:38.422
The fuck are you going?

08:38.571 --> 08:42.090
West Side.
Freamon found another.

08:42.238 --> 08:43.763
Fucking Freamon.

08:45.641 --> 08:46.862
He a transport?

08:47.010 --> 08:47.997
Borderline.

08:48.145 --> 08:49.466
B.P. and pulse are normal.

08:49.613 --> 08:51.479
We gave him Ativan
for withdrawal.

08:52.817 --> 08:56.651
Hey, you want to go
to a hospital?

09:03.293 --> 09:05.947
Let me ask you something:

09:06.095 --> 09:07.949
What kind of a fellow
rigs up a hot shot,

09:08.098 --> 09:10.619
then walks into a police station
to talk about it?

09:10.767 --> 09:13.556
Huh? Who does that?

09:13.704 --> 09:16.035
- You want us to wait?
- No.

09:23.080 --> 09:25.275
What is in your head, fella?

09:32.054 --> 09:34.008
The hot shot was
for this motherfucker

09:34.155 --> 09:36.591
that has been
beating on me.

09:39.062 --> 09:40.722
And the boy?

09:47.771 --> 09:49.760
He was dipping.

09:51.374 --> 09:53.365
I knew he was. I--

09:56.044 --> 10:00.812
I just didn't--
I didn't think...

10:03.219 --> 10:05.707
The child had no one for him--

10:05.855 --> 10:07.846
no mother, no family.

10:09.659 --> 10:12.612
He in the street
like I'm in the street.

10:12.761 --> 10:15.490
So I tried to...

10:22.504 --> 10:25.337
Like I ain't know
who I am, right?

10:27.342 --> 10:31.006
Like I'm pretending I ain't been
a dope fiend my whole damn life.

10:39.354 --> 10:41.150
Just lock me up, man.

10:49.763 --> 10:51.823
'Cause I killed that child.

11:24.565 --> 11:27.056
The shot wasn't for the kid.

11:29.036 --> 11:32.557
Let's throw this one back.

11:32.705 --> 11:35.860
This sad-ass motherfucker's carrying
more weight than we'll ever put on him.

11:36.009 --> 11:38.630
What about the clearance?

11:38.778 --> 11:40.665
Fuck the clearance.

11:40.814 --> 11:42.602
Cut him loose?

11:42.750 --> 11:44.368
Shit, he'll go off
a roof or some shit.

11:44.517 --> 11:45.971
My luck, I'll catch
that call too.

11:46.118 --> 11:48.639
Maybe D ward
over at Bayview,

11:48.788 --> 11:50.779
something with soft walls.

11:52.458 --> 11:54.212
Is you out of
your mind, nigger?

11:54.360 --> 11:56.615
You think I'ma pay you twice
for the same motherfucking package?

11:56.763 --> 11:58.417
Hey, I'm in
the same box here.

11:58.564 --> 12:00.353
Faggot took my shit
same as he took y'all's.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.388
Man, but that's
on your own people.

12:02.535 --> 12:04.490
Your guys was the ones doing
security on this shit.

12:04.638 --> 12:06.525
Hey, they worked it
the same as we did

12:06.673 --> 12:08.293
the last dozen shipments.

12:08.440 --> 12:11.061
Y'all was fine with it
up until this, right?

12:11.210 --> 12:12.463
Ain't no one have
a problem with it

12:12.612 --> 12:13.964
till the motherfucker
gave us one.

12:14.113 --> 12:16.800
Thing is, Joe, we called
a quorum on this,

12:16.949 --> 12:19.970
took a vote that says it's your people
need to make this right.

12:20.118 --> 12:23.141
No no, a co-op means
share and share alike.

12:23.288 --> 12:25.813
You share the good
and you share the bad.

12:30.628 --> 12:33.316
All right.

12:33.464 --> 12:37.054
I'll dig deep and do the full shipment
if that's what y'all need,

12:37.201 --> 12:40.658
But don't even think about coming
back to me for a re-up after this,

12:40.806 --> 12:44.462
'cause when that good raw shit comes
straight off the boat,

12:44.609 --> 12:47.766
it's gonna be mine only,
seeing as how y'all can't find the heart

12:47.914 --> 12:49.973
to stand with me now.

12:54.985 --> 12:58.319
You want to quorum up again,
think it over a little?

13:01.126 --> 13:03.321
Yeah, I thought you might.

13:04.962 --> 13:08.252
I'll get word back that we need
a fresh shipment, and right quick,

13:08.399 --> 13:11.521
and you can think about what we need
to do to improve security,

13:11.670 --> 13:14.297
make sure it only
happens the once.

13:28.252 --> 13:29.514
What's up, young'un?

13:37.262 --> 13:40.286
Which one of your people
was in charge of the stash?

13:41.297 --> 13:43.285
I mean, I want to talk to him.

13:43.434 --> 13:45.187
My nephew.

13:45.336 --> 13:47.622
My sister's boy.

13:47.771 --> 13:49.726
I can't give him up
like that.

13:49.874 --> 13:52.535
I can't do it.

13:53.944 --> 13:56.465
My connect had people there
when the shit went down.

13:56.613 --> 13:58.467
If that's what you need
to make you believe,

13:58.615 --> 14:01.346
you can hear it
straight from him.

14:33.850 --> 14:35.504
We are rich.

14:35.651 --> 14:38.051
That's what I'm talking about.

14:42.926 --> 14:45.258
Butch.

14:47.895 --> 14:49.556
My man. Mmm.

14:53.768 --> 14:56.257
Right, now, girl, you set that off slow,
you feel me?

14:56.405 --> 14:58.359
'Cause word gonna get around.
They gonna come back on you now.

14:58.506 --> 15:00.661
Nah. None of that.

15:00.809 --> 15:02.763
Yo, anybody ask about me
on another job,

15:02.911 --> 15:05.866
tell 'em,
"Kimmy been retired."

15:06.014 --> 15:07.335
All right?

15:07.482 --> 15:10.272
Be easy.

15:10.419 --> 15:13.873
How much you got left after splitting
with the Mexicans?

15:14.021 --> 15:16.643
26 raw.

15:16.791 --> 15:19.345
Mmm. Gracious.

15:19.493 --> 15:21.347
Shit, only problem, man,
I'll spend the rest of my life

15:21.496 --> 15:23.917
trying to put that
out on the street.

15:24.065 --> 15:25.552
I ain't no drug dealer, Butch.

15:25.700 --> 15:27.154
- You feel me?
- Hmm.

15:27.301 --> 15:29.792
Shit, we just stole
too much this damn time.

15:34.173 --> 15:37.007
So, what am l
gonna do, Butch?

15:39.080 --> 15:41.266
Well...

15:41.415 --> 15:43.870
you could come give
Joe a call.

15:44.018 --> 15:46.472
Offer to sell the shit
back to him now

15:46.620 --> 15:48.986
for 20¢ on the dollar.

15:50.358 --> 15:53.046
Joe would have found
some humor in that.

15:53.194 --> 15:55.425
I know you do.

16:04.604 --> 16:07.025
I understand there's
a waiting list.

16:07.174 --> 16:09.561
The thing is this kid has already
been in a foster home.

16:09.709 --> 16:11.063
Right.

16:11.211 --> 16:14.566
And now his foster mother's
been hospitalized, so--

16:14.715 --> 16:17.707
Right. No.

16:19.587 --> 16:22.039
Is there a supervisor
that I can talk to?

16:22.187 --> 16:25.142
I'm gonna be a little late for
roll call. Gotta get this kid settled.

16:25.290 --> 16:27.211
What's wrong with D.S.S.?

16:27.359 --> 16:29.347
On the phone with them right now.
They're talking about a group home.

16:29.496 --> 16:30.916
So? Either you come up
with a guardian,

16:31.064 --> 16:33.464
or he goes to Social Services.
No two ways about it.

16:34.768 --> 16:37.134
Hello? Hello?

16:47.446 --> 16:48.967
Need your help.
Get dressed.

16:49.114 --> 16:52.437
I'm suspended with pay,
pending a full trial board.

16:52.584 --> 16:55.339
Can't do nothing
for no one, Kima.

16:55.486 --> 16:57.675
Fuck what they say.
This here's police work,

16:57.823 --> 16:59.814
and I'm asking
if you police.

17:01.760 --> 17:04.482
All right. Listen up, you mutts.
This is complicated.

17:04.631 --> 17:08.117
I mean, it isn't complicated
if you went to college or,

17:08.266 --> 17:10.287
I don't know, your mothers actually
stopped drinking

17:10.435 --> 17:12.198
for a minute
while they was pregnant.

17:13.238 --> 17:16.393
But for Baltimore City Police,
this is complicated.

17:16.541 --> 17:20.830
Anyway, this right here is for
the Major Crimes homicide investigation

17:20.979 --> 17:23.935
into the bodies being found
in the vacant houses here in Western.

17:24.083 --> 17:26.503
Command now wants
all the districts

17:26.653 --> 17:28.640
to check every vacant
in the city.

17:28.785 --> 17:32.275
That means you will need to go door to
door to every vacant house in your post

17:32.423 --> 17:34.511
and look at what was used
to board it up.

17:34.659 --> 17:36.514
Most will have the Phillips head screws
that H.C.D. uses,

17:36.661 --> 17:39.417
Iike this here
on the flier.

17:39.565 --> 17:41.617
But if you see a house
that's been boarded up

17:41.766 --> 17:43.987
with nail-gun nails
like these shown here,

17:44.135 --> 17:45.855
call your sector sergeant
immediately.

17:46.003 --> 17:48.658
You can enter the house,
but if you find a body,

17:48.806 --> 17:53.027
do not disturb
the crime scene. All told.

17:53.176 --> 17:54.730
But what l
don't understand is

17:54.878 --> 17:56.865
why they keep busting
my balls about this.

17:57.013 --> 17:58.401
I mean, Daniels gave me
a slap on the wrist

17:58.548 --> 18:00.202
for the thing
with the minister, right?

18:00.351 --> 18:03.306
And Marimow got bounced just before
he could fuck me up on anything else.

18:03.453 --> 18:05.542
You sure we
on the right block?

18:05.690 --> 18:08.745
Yeah. Put them on the curb
right here, more or less.

18:08.893 --> 18:10.480
And then you fired
the nail gun

18:10.628 --> 18:12.349
into the asphalt,
right where they sat?

18:12.497 --> 18:14.351
Yeah. Right next to
the little broad's leg.

18:14.499 --> 18:16.685
So who tells
these l.I.D. fucks

18:16.832 --> 18:18.353
to start running
through my paperwork,

18:18.502 --> 18:19.888
Iooking for
who the fuck cares?

18:20.036 --> 18:21.490
I mean, it's not like
they caught me stealing

18:21.638 --> 18:24.860
or brutalizing motherfuckers,
right? Right?

18:25.008 --> 18:26.976
Look.

18:29.546 --> 18:30.766
Yeah. It looks like
it could be.

18:30.914 --> 18:32.506
Is that about right?

18:34.017 --> 18:35.348
Yeah.

18:36.487 --> 18:38.419
Must have worked himself free.

18:45.962 --> 18:47.515
I took them nails
to Ballistics.

18:47.663 --> 18:50.352
Comparer said he could match
anything out of that gun,

18:50.499 --> 18:53.024
and maybe the nail gun itself,
if we could get it.

18:54.437 --> 18:56.658
I mean, I know they're
gonna take my stripes,

18:56.806 --> 18:58.627
but you don't think they're
gonna go past that, right?

18:58.775 --> 19:01.396
Herc, what'd you do exactly?

19:01.543 --> 19:04.499
Lost the camera
I took from l.S.D.

19:04.647 --> 19:06.366
without my
lieutenant's approval.

19:06.515 --> 19:09.570
And what evidence
I got from the camera,

19:09.718 --> 19:11.812
I put to a made-up
informant.

19:13.922 --> 19:16.644
Son, they're gonna beat
on your white ass

19:16.791 --> 19:18.692
Iike it's a rented mule.

19:20.197 --> 19:22.665
Fuck.

19:24.065 --> 19:25.585
Then make him sign it.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.219
Did it to himself,
that cocksucker.

19:27.368 --> 19:28.655
I hate that bastard.

19:28.803 --> 19:30.862
He called him cocksucker.

19:39.381 --> 19:41.669
You're gonna break
that call button.

19:41.817 --> 19:43.404
Look, I'm sorry.

19:43.552 --> 19:46.107
I don't mean to bother y'all,
but I don't get but four channels.

19:46.255 --> 19:47.808
That's all you get.

19:47.956 --> 19:49.309
What about my man
over there?

19:49.457 --> 19:51.378
He has insurance.

19:51.525 --> 19:53.547
And insurance pays
for his cable hookup.

19:53.695 --> 19:56.283
Only reason you're admitted
is that fracture.

19:56.432 --> 19:59.952
Soon as we can
discharge you, we will.

20:00.100 --> 20:01.621
All you gangsters

20:01.769 --> 20:03.957
wash up in our E.R.
Iike it's your due.

20:04.105 --> 20:06.460
You could stand out there
slinging drugs

20:06.608 --> 20:08.729
till you get shot or cut,

20:08.876 --> 20:11.130
have us put you
back together free of charge

20:11.278 --> 20:12.665
so you can do it again.

20:12.812 --> 20:15.901
- Gangster, huh?
- Oh, you're not that?

20:16.049 --> 20:18.170
I pulled your admissions.

20:18.318 --> 20:21.073
You were here in '90
for a gunshot wound,

20:21.222 --> 20:24.678
and three years before that, you were
here for chest surgery for a cutting.

20:24.825 --> 20:27.246
Long time back, yeah.

20:27.395 --> 20:30.383
And I see
you're still at it.

20:30.531 --> 20:33.552
Dennis Wise,
I'm Howard Colvin.

20:33.699 --> 20:35.633
Are you police?

20:41.475 --> 20:44.195
I... used to be,

20:44.343 --> 20:47.266
but now I'm a bit of
a teacher up at Tilghman.

20:47.414 --> 20:49.668
I got a little problem,

20:49.816 --> 20:52.371
and you know Carver
over at the Western,

20:52.519 --> 20:55.606
he said that you might
be able to help me.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.742
I went up to your gym.

20:57.890 --> 21:00.010
They told me what happened.

21:00.159 --> 21:03.381
What is it that
I'm supposed to know about?

21:03.529 --> 21:05.216
It's Namond Brice.

21:05.365 --> 21:08.320
Yeah. What's the problem?

21:08.467 --> 21:09.722
Oh... shit.

21:09.869 --> 21:13.169
Well, I've just come
to care about the kid.

21:19.211 --> 21:20.998
You heard it was
Little Kevin?

21:21.147 --> 21:23.834
I seen one of the police step out
the household with his necklace.

21:23.983 --> 21:26.212
That's Kevin
up in there, yo.

21:28.155 --> 21:31.146
This motherfucker be killing niggers
just to do it.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.345
See?

21:34.493 --> 21:37.015
Nigger killing motherfuckers
just 'cause he can,

21:37.162 --> 21:39.050
not 'cause they snitching,

21:39.198 --> 21:41.651
not 'cause it's business,

21:41.799 --> 21:43.921
but 'cause this shit
just comes natural to him.

21:44.068 --> 21:46.589
- Yo, Bodie, man--
- I mean, Little Kevin is gone--

21:46.738 --> 21:48.124
this nigger
don't feel nothing.

21:48.273 --> 21:50.093
And all them motherfuckers
in them rowhouses,

21:50.241 --> 21:52.729
- nobody mean a fucking thing to him.
- Bodie, calm the fuck down.

21:52.877 --> 21:54.298
Fuck Marlo, man!
Fuck him

21:54.447 --> 21:58.670
and anybody that think
it's all right to do people this way.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.171
You hear me?

22:00.319 --> 22:01.706
Fuck all y'all motherfuckers.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.408
Get the fuck off me, man.

22:03.556 --> 22:06.752
That's his friend in the bag.

22:11.663 --> 22:15.760
It's like that nigger
ain't fit, man.

22:21.139 --> 22:23.093
You see that shit, yo?

22:23.240 --> 22:25.429
Go on. Lock his
dumb ass up.

22:25.577 --> 22:29.165
Attica! Attica! Attica!

22:29.312 --> 22:30.665
...the number of victims

22:30.813 --> 22:33.168
discovered shot to death
in the boarded-up buildings.

22:33.317 --> 22:34.470
How flattering for us.

22:34.618 --> 22:37.073
It knocks the school deficit
right off the front pages.

22:37.221 --> 22:39.108
There's your silver lining
right there.

22:39.256 --> 22:42.012
- Those bodies are on Royce.
- School deficit should be too.

22:42.159 --> 22:44.881
Should be, but that's a problem that's
gonna play out in the next fiscal year.

22:45.029 --> 22:46.350
By then
you're out of Teflon.

22:46.498 --> 22:48.185
So I take
the governor's money,

22:48.333 --> 22:50.852
and then two years from now
when I shake the hand of any voter

22:51.000 --> 22:52.754
in the D.C. suburbs,
they say, "All right.

22:52.903 --> 22:55.190
You're the guy
who needed my tax dollars

22:55.339 --> 22:56.892
to bail out
your school system."

22:57.039 --> 22:59.962
If you take his check, you lose votes
in Prince George's and Montgomery,

23:00.110 --> 23:01.997
and you can't beat him statewide
without the counties.

23:02.145 --> 23:04.699
But two years from now,
if you're governor,

23:04.848 --> 23:06.534
you can help the city
from Annapolis.

23:06.683 --> 23:08.870
He's the mayor now.

23:09.019 --> 23:10.973
I agree we can't fix
the city schools,

23:11.121 --> 23:12.975
but we can't let them
get any worse either.

23:13.123 --> 23:14.942
Go back to Annapolis.
Eat his shit.

23:15.090 --> 23:16.844
If we lose local control
of the schools,

23:16.992 --> 23:18.379
Nerese and the teachers
will rip you,

23:18.528 --> 23:22.283
but the rest of the city will see
you did it for them kids.

23:22.432 --> 23:24.332
Kids don't vote.

23:48.290 --> 23:50.945
Taking a risk
with our supply, ain't you?

23:51.092 --> 23:54.716
I mean, setting up a meet
with anybody other than us.

23:54.864 --> 23:56.284
Got to.

23:56.432 --> 23:57.686
The boy craves
reassurance.

23:57.834 --> 24:01.388
Boss, you get that boy Marlo
in line on our connect,

24:01.535 --> 24:04.524
he might try to go round
the co-op, go round us.

24:04.673 --> 24:06.093
You know what I'm saying?

24:06.241 --> 24:09.362
Cautious as those Greeks be,
who you think they gonna trust?

24:09.511 --> 24:12.071
They know us.
They don't know him.

24:13.415 --> 24:15.270
Damn.

24:15.417 --> 24:17.079
Look at this nigger
coming round.

24:18.120 --> 24:20.520
Easy, son. Easy.

24:27.895 --> 24:29.716
Yeah. I might have known
I'd find you boys in here,

24:29.865 --> 24:31.018
burning that oil after hours.

24:31.165 --> 24:33.420
Nigger, I'ma
kill you twice.

24:33.568 --> 24:37.264
Oh? So you don't want
your shipment, huh?

24:39.040 --> 24:40.405
Say your piece.

24:43.411 --> 24:47.165
Well, it just so happens
I got some heroin for sale.

24:47.313 --> 24:50.370
Marketwise, you fellas
look like buyers. You feel me?

24:50.517 --> 24:52.471
This some shameless shit.

24:52.619 --> 24:54.473
Oh, ain't no shame
in my game, dawg.

24:54.622 --> 24:57.844
I'm here about the business.
Ain't that right, Joe?

24:57.992 --> 25:01.348
- How much?
- 20 on the dollar.

25:01.495 --> 25:03.483
10, nigger.

25:03.632 --> 25:06.294
Don't make me say 25 now.

25:08.136 --> 25:10.289
That's 400,000.

25:10.436 --> 25:14.193
How about we take your
faggot ass in the backroom

25:14.340 --> 25:17.597
and get into some
diabolical brutality,

25:17.745 --> 25:19.599
find our shit
the old-fashioned way?

25:19.746 --> 25:22.567
- Feel me?
- Oh, I feel you.

25:22.716 --> 25:24.604
Sounds like a plan.

25:24.751 --> 25:27.720
I don't know though, Joe.
You think Omar gonna give it up?

25:29.689 --> 25:31.655
20 on the dollar it is.

25:38.196 --> 25:40.130
Say, how's she ticking, Joe?

26:06.024 --> 26:08.151
I'll be in touch.

26:15.034 --> 26:18.221
And he thinks
I'll help the schools,

26:18.369 --> 26:19.889
help the city a lot more

26:20.037 --> 26:22.028
if I'm governor
two years from now.

26:23.709 --> 26:25.862
I'm thinking that way
it wouldn't just be about me

26:26.011 --> 26:28.198
if I don't take the money.

26:28.347 --> 26:30.781
Are you asking me
what I think?

26:32.517 --> 26:35.782
I think you'll do
the right thing.

26:59.110 --> 27:01.272
For real, I'm telling you
the truth.

27:03.281 --> 27:05.270
Tickles.

27:08.718 --> 27:10.640
You sure you want
to do this?

27:10.788 --> 27:13.381
I don't want to hurt you.

28:19.689 --> 28:22.410
Detective Crutchfield,
do you have a moment?

28:22.559 --> 28:24.116
Yes, ma'am.

28:25.894 --> 28:27.415
Is something wrong?

28:27.563 --> 28:30.051
I've got a question
on these reports.

28:30.199 --> 28:31.953
Were they all found
in the basement?

28:32.102 --> 28:34.489
No, ma'am. We've been finding
most in the basement,

28:34.636 --> 28:37.156
but some are on
the upper floors too.

28:37.305 --> 28:40.126
Can you be specific
in the 24s,

28:40.274 --> 28:42.095
for my sake anyway?

28:42.243 --> 28:43.905
- No problem.
- Thanks.

28:45.580 --> 28:47.070
How many so far?

28:48.984 --> 28:51.105
- 17.
- Christ.

28:51.253 --> 28:53.574
That's a lot of red names.

28:53.722 --> 28:55.276
It's your first "Red Bull."

28:55.425 --> 28:57.279
Yeah.
I thought I'd get

28:57.427 --> 28:59.779
a nice, quiet domestic or two
to start me off.

28:59.926 --> 29:02.115
We got national press
on this already.

29:02.263 --> 29:03.917
You'll be fine, Rhonnie.

29:04.065 --> 29:06.090
Just don't let any of these guys
see you sweating.

29:07.736 --> 29:09.590
Hey, I need
a case dropped.

29:09.737 --> 29:12.900
To tell Mello to sign off,
I need a friendly A.S.A.

29:14.675 --> 29:16.230
He kicks out
a radio-car window,

29:16.377 --> 29:17.867
and you wanna
give him a walk?

29:20.381 --> 29:23.369
What's the date range
as per decomp?

29:23.517 --> 29:25.638
The one on Mount Street
looked about a week.

29:25.786 --> 29:28.307
Some a few days,

29:28.455 --> 29:31.077
some are skeletal
at this stage.

29:31.224 --> 29:33.212
They all head shots?

29:33.361 --> 29:34.581
Multiples, most of them.

29:34.728 --> 29:36.683
- Black males, 1 5 to 25?
- Uh-huh.

29:36.831 --> 29:39.185
No, some older.

29:39.333 --> 29:42.288
We got one in a security guard's uniform
around here somewhere.

29:42.437 --> 29:43.723
- You laser-print?
- Mm-hmm.

29:43.872 --> 29:45.690
Vacuum the rooms?

29:45.839 --> 29:47.726
Yes.

29:47.874 --> 29:51.096
Gluco for blood?
What's the geography?

29:51.244 --> 29:54.099
13 on West Side, Baltimore to
Winchester, Schroeder to the Grove.

29:54.247 --> 29:57.403
The Eastern boys found four more
in the houses on Monument Street.

29:57.550 --> 29:59.538
- East Side?
- Yeah. That threw us.

29:59.686 --> 30:02.508
We're casting a wider net now,
searching the vacants citywide.

30:02.656 --> 30:04.677
My number's 23
in the office pool.

30:04.826 --> 30:06.378
I still have hope.

30:06.526 --> 30:09.913
Hell of a case, right here.

30:10.062 --> 30:11.616
You know, if I was police,
I don't think

30:11.764 --> 30:13.217
I could lean back
on it. You?

30:13.365 --> 30:15.620
Not if I was real police.

30:15.769 --> 30:17.055
Right.

30:17.204 --> 30:19.069
Thank you, Detective.

30:57.275 --> 30:58.595
Calvin, you done already?

30:58.743 --> 31:00.734
Yeah, I'm done.

31:28.506 --> 31:30.760
Attention, a reminder:

31:30.909 --> 31:35.198
Answer sheets must be turned
into the office by you and only you

31:35.346 --> 31:38.802
immediately upon
completion of the tests.

31:38.951 --> 31:41.504
Thank you
for your cooperation.

31:41.651 --> 31:43.638
Where are we
on the nail gun?

31:43.787 --> 31:45.107
A Hilti DX model.

31:45.255 --> 31:47.076
High end, but common
among contractors.

31:47.224 --> 31:49.578
Is it what Sergeant Hauk saw
in the back of Chris Partlow's truck?

31:49.726 --> 31:51.381
We showed him one,
and he thought so.

31:51.528 --> 31:54.785
Then we dragged his ass back down
to the block where he did the car stop.

31:54.933 --> 31:57.687
- Anything?
- We found what might be a hole

31:57.835 --> 31:59.523
where he said
he fired into the street,

31:59.671 --> 32:01.992
but no nail, even after sweeping
the block

32:02.138 --> 32:03.491
with metal detectors.

32:03.639 --> 32:06.262
Probably took a ride
in some bastard's radio,

32:06.409 --> 32:08.130
but now it's
in a tire pile somewhere.

32:08.278 --> 32:11.233
So our next move is a search
and seizure on that truck.

32:11.381 --> 32:13.236
Along with a court order
for hair and blood

32:13.383 --> 32:14.670
from Chris and Snoop both.

32:14.817 --> 32:17.573
With everything we're
pulling out these houses,

32:17.721 --> 32:19.241
we might get lucky
with some tracework.

32:19.389 --> 32:22.212
- What's your P.C.?
- Herc sees the nail gun.

32:22.359 --> 32:24.147
Nothing wrong with owning
a power tool.

32:24.294 --> 32:26.914
What's the P.C. on Chris
and Snoop specifically?

32:27.063 --> 32:28.950
A witness--

32:29.098 --> 32:33.655
the boy who was told by a co-conspirator
who the murderer was.

32:33.803 --> 32:36.091
The boy is a source.
He's not a witness.

32:36.238 --> 32:38.693
If he's just a source,
you don't have enough.

32:38.841 --> 32:40.595
No, but with the links that we got
between some of these bodies

32:40.743 --> 32:43.064
and Stanfield and his organization,
we have a pattern.

32:43.213 --> 32:46.402
Weak. Very weak.

32:46.550 --> 32:47.881
Oh, fuck it.

32:49.352 --> 32:51.343
Give me an hour.

32:55.524 --> 32:57.779
You haven't left me alone
all week.

32:57.927 --> 32:59.247
Every time I come out
of the pool,

32:59.396 --> 33:01.386
you want to dry me off
without a towel.

33:03.498 --> 33:06.921
- Dennis Wise.
- Hey, man.

33:07.069 --> 33:09.731
Yeah. Were you able
to get some word?

33:11.007 --> 33:15.128
On my say-so, he's willing
to sit and hear you out.

33:15.275 --> 33:18.301
But what you asking him for--
I don't know.

33:19.948 --> 33:21.301
Good luck, though.

33:21.449 --> 33:23.737
If you see
my man Carver again,

33:23.885 --> 33:26.541
you tell him
he owe me one now.

33:26.688 --> 33:30.591
- All right, man. Appreciate it.
- You got it, bro.

33:32.928 --> 33:33.915
All right.

33:34.062 --> 33:36.550
Y'all coming back
with a warrant?

33:36.697 --> 33:39.030
The roughneck
in room 232.

33:40.935 --> 33:44.124
From what I know, he runs
a gym program for kids.

33:44.272 --> 33:47.570
He got himself shot for trying to pull
a kid off the corner.

33:50.745 --> 33:52.733
Look, you need to
speak up now,

33:52.881 --> 33:55.406
or face the fact
that you never spoke at all.

33:57.450 --> 34:01.240
They wouldn't let me
see my son at marches.

34:01.388 --> 34:04.323
Said there wasn't much left
by the time y'all found him.

34:06.393 --> 34:09.795
We did the best we could
with the information we had.

34:18.741 --> 34:21.393
Word come to me
that a man named Chris

34:21.541 --> 34:24.630
and a girl
named Loop or Snoop

34:24.777 --> 34:27.400
or some such
took my son and killed him.

34:27.547 --> 34:30.210
Told me I would never
see my boy again.

34:35.922 --> 34:37.777
Why can't you just make
an exception in this case

34:37.925 --> 34:39.779
and move his name
to the top of the list,

34:39.927 --> 34:41.514
see that he gets
another foster parent?

34:41.661 --> 34:43.313
The list is the list.

34:43.462 --> 34:45.215
Some clients have been
in group homes for years.

34:45.362 --> 34:47.051
He was in group homes
for years.

34:47.199 --> 34:50.020
- Now he's gotta go back because--?
- Please don't raise your voice.

34:50.168 --> 34:52.262
- If you're going to raise your voice--
- Please.

34:55.041 --> 34:58.307
There's gotta be some way
that he doesn't have to go--

35:02.182 --> 35:04.804
Yeah, there is.

35:04.952 --> 35:06.611
There's gotta be.

35:09.755 --> 35:12.610
How about--

35:12.758 --> 35:16.147
how about if I take him
as a foster parent?

35:16.295 --> 35:18.549
The screening process
takes three to four months.

35:18.698 --> 35:20.818
This child can't be
in your custody, Sergeant.

35:20.966 --> 35:24.403
He needs to come back under
our supervision per the juvenile order.

35:33.811 --> 35:36.500
Think you all that for hassling niggers
and shit?

35:36.647 --> 35:38.435
I know I'm all that.

35:38.582 --> 35:40.604
I'm thinking
about some pussy.

35:40.752 --> 35:42.439
- Yeah. Me too.
- Mm-hmm.

35:42.587 --> 35:45.022
They dumped their tools.

35:47.659 --> 35:51.289
Nothing under the seats.
Nothing in the glove box.

35:52.931 --> 35:55.084
Registered to some little
old lady, no doubt.

35:55.232 --> 35:58.421
These guys know the drill.

35:58.569 --> 36:01.539
Can you see
these two riding tail?

36:05.376 --> 36:07.675
Come on.

36:31.202 --> 36:34.262
Aw, shit.

36:37.175 --> 36:38.834
There it is.

36:40.143 --> 36:41.975
Whoa.

36:42.980 --> 36:44.633
Uh-huh.

36:44.782 --> 36:46.272
It ain't even our truck.

36:53.924 --> 36:56.178
But I need
to hear it from you.

36:56.327 --> 36:58.114
From me?

36:58.262 --> 37:00.716
This is not my affair, huh?

37:00.862 --> 37:03.684
It is what Joe says.
I'm only here right now for Joe,

37:03.833 --> 37:05.953
who I trust,
who I respect,

37:06.101 --> 37:08.923
who I worked with
for many years.

37:09.072 --> 37:12.661
You I do not know,
and I don't need to know.

37:12.808 --> 37:17.332
But because this thing
goes wrong for Joe, then--

37:17.480 --> 37:21.170
Well, how am I supposed to know
this ain't no setup?

37:21.317 --> 37:25.309
How am I supposed to know
your people ain't in on it too?

37:26.888 --> 37:30.211
You know because Joe says

37:30.359 --> 37:32.246
and because I say.

37:32.395 --> 37:34.049
And you trust
your people like that?

37:34.196 --> 37:37.451
I talked to my driver.

37:37.599 --> 37:39.966
I looked into his soul.

38:06.129 --> 38:08.482
Chris and Snoop
just been popped

38:08.631 --> 38:11.885
on a gun charge,
found in the truck.

38:12.033 --> 38:14.087
Call the bondsman.

38:14.236 --> 38:17.957
But first, put a follow
on him right there.

38:18.106 --> 38:20.895
- Who, white dude with the hat on?
- Mm-hmm.

38:21.043 --> 38:23.033
- What, he a problem?
- Nah.

38:25.147 --> 38:27.581
I just need to know more.

38:29.216 --> 38:31.515
- All right.
- All right.

38:33.553 --> 38:34.740
Satisfied?

38:34.888 --> 38:37.043
$90,000 to you
in the morning.

38:37.190 --> 38:39.178
We'll put a hunt
on Omar later,

38:39.326 --> 38:41.692
after the heat on them
empty houses gives way.

38:50.738 --> 38:52.331
The fuck
are you doing here?

38:54.041 --> 38:55.596
You think that charge
gets dropped without

38:55.744 --> 38:57.539
somebody showing you
some special love?

39:01.047 --> 39:02.639
You hungry?

39:04.117 --> 39:05.448
Come on.

39:15.295 --> 39:17.016
All right.

39:17.164 --> 39:20.017
Might be surety bond
on this Chris Partlow,

39:20.165 --> 39:21.819
given all of his priors.

39:21.967 --> 39:25.563
Pearson woman--
not so much. All right?

39:39.420 --> 39:40.639
What's this?

39:40.788 --> 39:43.708
Court order.
We get blood and hair.

39:43.856 --> 39:45.710
14 head hairs,

39:45.858 --> 39:47.111
14 body hairs,

39:47.259 --> 39:49.180
two blood samples each.

39:49.328 --> 39:51.182
It's a lot of houses,

39:51.331 --> 39:52.650
a lot of deeds.

39:52.799 --> 39:55.266
Who knows what
you left behind?

40:06.744 --> 40:09.165
We still
in the city?

40:09.314 --> 40:11.269
Cylburn Arboretum.

40:11.416 --> 40:13.407
Pimlico's right
up the hill.

40:16.455 --> 40:18.446
This is nice.

40:22.761 --> 40:25.321
I ain't no snitch.

40:26.398 --> 40:27.917
I didn't say you were.

40:28.065 --> 40:30.754
I've been doing this
a long time.

40:30.902 --> 40:33.132
I ain't never said
nothing to no cop.

40:42.313 --> 40:44.304
I feel old.

40:45.850 --> 40:48.772
I been out there
since I was 13.

40:48.921 --> 40:51.740
I ain't never fucked up a count,
never stole off a package,

40:51.888 --> 40:55.044
never did some shit
that I wasn't told to do.

40:55.192 --> 40:56.812
I've been straight up.

40:56.960 --> 40:58.414
But what come back?

40:58.562 --> 41:00.449
Hmm? You think if I get
jammed up on some shit,

41:00.597 --> 41:02.786
they'd be like, "All right,
yeah. Bodie been there.

41:02.933 --> 41:04.988
Bodie hang tough.
We got his pay lawyer.

41:05.136 --> 41:06.189
We got a bail."

41:06.337 --> 41:08.826
They want me to stand
with them, right?

41:08.973 --> 41:11.762
But where the fuck they at, when they
supposed to be standing by us?

41:11.909 --> 41:13.631
I mean, when shit goes bad
and there's hell to pay,

41:13.777 --> 41:16.712
where they at?

41:18.381 --> 41:20.602
This game is rigged, man.

41:20.750 --> 41:22.971
We like the little bitches
on a chessboard.

41:23.120 --> 41:25.952
Pawns.

41:28.525 --> 41:31.146
Yo, I'm not snitching
on none of my boys--

41:31.294 --> 41:34.249
not my corner,
and not no Barksdale people,

41:34.397 --> 41:36.218
or what's left of them.

41:36.367 --> 41:38.753
But Marlo-- this nigger
and his kind, man,

41:38.901 --> 41:40.892
they gotta fall.
They gotta.

41:43.039 --> 41:46.769
Well, for that to happen,
somebody's gotta step up.

41:50.780 --> 41:52.134
I'll do what I gotta.

41:52.282 --> 41:55.270
I don't give a fuck.

41:55.419 --> 41:57.750
Just don't ask me to live
on my fucking knees, you know?

42:03.359 --> 42:06.681
You're a soldier, Bodie.

42:06.830 --> 42:08.821
Hell, yeah.

42:27.749 --> 42:29.269
I remember you.

42:29.417 --> 42:32.039
You used to be a roll-up
on Pennsie and Fremont.

42:32.186 --> 42:33.740
Yeah. It was my old post.

42:33.888 --> 42:38.045
- I came up with C.B.S.
- Calhoun, Baker, Stricker.

42:38.193 --> 42:40.748
Yeah. I used to have to
bang up on y'all all the time.

42:40.896 --> 42:43.818
I remember that too.

42:43.967 --> 42:47.686
Yeah. I ain't a cop
now, right?

42:47.835 --> 42:50.556
I mean,
like I told Cutty,

42:50.705 --> 42:52.559
I'm sort of like
a teacher now,

42:52.707 --> 42:54.294
and that's how I come
to know Namond.

42:54.443 --> 42:57.097
Only reason I'm even here
is Cutty spoke for you.

42:57.245 --> 42:59.508
He say what I'm asking?

43:02.449 --> 43:04.137
Your boy...

43:04.285 --> 43:06.741
is smart and funny

43:06.888 --> 43:09.073
and open-hearted,

43:09.222 --> 43:11.977
and he got
some flex in him.

43:12.125 --> 43:14.980
And I ain't see it at first,
'cause he was always acting out,

43:15.128 --> 43:17.450
always full up
of corner talk--

43:17.598 --> 43:20.386
you know, just talking
shit to hide himself.

43:20.535 --> 43:22.055
But he could go
a lot of places

43:22.203 --> 43:24.057
and do a lot of things
in his life,

43:24.204 --> 43:26.593
be out there in the world
in a way that, you know,

43:26.741 --> 43:30.131
didn't happen
for you and me.

43:30.278 --> 43:34.033
I mean, you know,
our kind? Shit.

43:34.180 --> 43:37.736
Man, we both know we gonna go
to our grave forever knowing

43:37.884 --> 43:40.206
what block Bentalou
dead-ends at,

43:40.354 --> 43:43.341
or who got their liquor license over
at the Underground,

43:43.490 --> 43:45.210
or what corner Tater man
got shot on

43:45.359 --> 43:47.346
when he come out the Musical Lounge
back in '88.

43:47.494 --> 43:49.792
It's a vision in gold.

43:56.836 --> 43:59.990
The West Side we knew--

44:00.139 --> 44:01.993
it's dead, man.

44:02.141 --> 44:06.064
You know, people
in the game nowadays--

44:06.213 --> 44:08.533
I mean, it's a whole
different breed--

44:08.682 --> 44:11.170
no code, no family,

44:11.317 --> 44:14.185
and damn sure no respect.

44:15.522 --> 44:18.576
I mean, you send Namond
out on the corner now,

44:18.724 --> 44:22.046
I'm giving him
maybe one, two years

44:22.194 --> 44:24.214
before he
down at the morgue.

44:24.363 --> 44:27.418
And maybe, if you're lucky,
up here with you.

44:27.566 --> 44:30.354
Maybe, maybe not.
That's the game.

44:30.503 --> 44:33.438
I'm talking about
Namond here, Mr. Brice.

44:35.441 --> 44:39.397
He's a lot of things,
a lot of good things.

44:39.546 --> 44:42.565
I mean, before you know, he might
surprise all of us given half a chance,

44:42.713 --> 44:45.167
but he ain't made
for them corners, man.

44:45.316 --> 44:48.539
I mean, not like we were.

44:48.687 --> 44:50.541
That's why
I come down here--

44:50.689 --> 44:52.911
because I gotta believe
that you see it,

44:53.058 --> 44:56.516
being who you are
and all you've been through.

45:00.199 --> 45:01.861
You know your son.

45:08.540 --> 45:10.804
It's in your hands, man.

45:14.646 --> 45:16.899
You asking too much.

45:17.047 --> 45:20.711
Yeah, but I'm asking.

45:22.620 --> 45:24.207
You sure it was
the boy Bodie?

45:24.355 --> 45:26.343
Man, I seen him come from
out the Central Booking

45:26.489 --> 45:27.577
over on Eager Street side.

45:27.724 --> 45:30.012
Then he got in some car
with some white dude.

45:30.159 --> 45:32.280
Police? What kind of car,
a Caprice?

45:32.429 --> 45:35.626
No, a hooptie, I think.

45:39.670 --> 45:41.959
They on you like
a motherfucker.

45:42.106 --> 45:45.598
They jacking you up, pulling all your
work out them houses, right?

45:47.278 --> 45:49.299
Man, we can't have nobody
snitching on us now.

45:49.448 --> 45:51.334
We ain't sure it's that.

45:51.481 --> 45:53.969
What, you wanna let it go?

45:54.117 --> 45:55.705
Risk it?

45:55.853 --> 45:58.207
Huh-uh. Send a message.

45:58.355 --> 46:01.310
Maybe give it to your pup,
get him started.

46:01.457 --> 46:03.678
You and Snoop,
y'all lay low

46:03.827 --> 46:05.513
till this shit here
blow down.

46:05.662 --> 46:07.283
Boy worked for Bodie.

46:07.430 --> 46:09.661
First time, best be
someone he ain't know.

46:16.338 --> 46:17.726
You hear what Joe said?

46:17.873 --> 46:21.228
Joe's saying this cocksucker
who stole our shit

46:21.377 --> 46:23.971
wanna sell it back to us
for 30 on the dollar.

46:26.517 --> 46:29.918
Joe's saying it's another
90 to buy back our share.

46:39.161 --> 46:40.714
Dag, yo.

46:40.863 --> 46:44.519
Thought you forgot
about me.

46:44.667 --> 46:47.430
Hey, why don't you
wait outside, all right?

46:52.507 --> 46:54.065
You spoke to his father?

46:56.145 --> 46:58.166
If it goes the way I think,

46:58.314 --> 47:00.700
he'll be back with his mom
by tomorrow.

47:00.849 --> 47:03.270
Big day all around tomorrow.

47:03.417 --> 47:06.352
Delegate Watkins got us 30 minutes
at the mayor's office.

47:07.923 --> 47:09.777
Icicles!

47:09.925 --> 47:11.780
Get 'em while it's going!
Icicles!

47:11.927 --> 47:13.682
Come on!

47:13.829 --> 47:15.116
Yo, Spider,
what's the count?

47:15.264 --> 47:17.698
I don't even think we gonna
sell out today, man.

47:27.108 --> 47:29.063
Yo, Bodie.

47:29.210 --> 47:30.405
Yo,
Bodie.

47:35.683 --> 47:37.344
Icicles! Icicles!

47:42.657 --> 47:44.476
Yo, Bodie,
you better run, yo.

47:44.624 --> 47:46.545
Yo, this my corner.
I ain't running nowhere.

47:46.693 --> 47:48.355
Bodie, is you crazy?

47:59.607 --> 48:00.526
Shit is on!

48:00.674 --> 48:02.495
Run with it,
motherfuckers!

48:02.644 --> 48:04.964
I don't give a fuck!

48:05.113 --> 48:07.499
I'm right here!

48:07.647 --> 48:11.336
You ain't putting me up in one of them
empty-ass houses, neither.

48:11.484 --> 48:14.351
Bodie, come on, man.

49:48.847 --> 49:50.367
I don't know about this.

49:50.514 --> 49:53.403
Mayor's office.

49:53.551 --> 49:56.072
Yes. Actually, you want

49:56.220 --> 49:58.676
the Department of Housing
and Community Development.

49:58.824 --> 50:00.443
Look, I don't know
about this, man.

50:00.592 --> 50:02.649
I just...

50:04.594 --> 50:06.255
Ma'am...

50:09.566 --> 50:11.988
if...

50:12.136 --> 50:13.623
sorry.

50:13.771 --> 50:15.625
If the mayor
prefers not to--

50:15.772 --> 50:20.130
if he, like, feels more comfortable
with Dr. Parenti alone, you know,

50:20.277 --> 50:23.200
because of the drug-legalization
controversy last year...

50:23.347 --> 50:25.934
I don't think Mayor Carcetti
is in your meeting.

50:26.082 --> 50:27.549
He's in Annapolis.

50:30.621 --> 50:33.488
Okay. Thank you.

50:41.364 --> 50:44.060
- What up?
- What up?

50:45.970 --> 50:48.456
Still asleep?

50:48.603 --> 50:50.595
Early bird get that worm.

50:52.775 --> 50:54.437
How you liking the crib?

50:55.477 --> 50:57.598
Fine, thanks.

50:57.747 --> 51:00.215
Must feel good to be
on your own.

51:03.286 --> 51:05.720
Yo, where you get
that ring from?

51:07.557 --> 51:09.219
Took it from a nigger.

51:14.329 --> 51:16.117
Why? You want it?

51:16.265 --> 51:17.960
Nah nah.
You keep it, Shorty.

51:24.907 --> 51:27.795
I'll go get Bug
ready for school.

51:27.943 --> 51:30.105
You ready to put in work?

51:31.448 --> 51:34.501
Two things then:

51:34.648 --> 51:38.605
First, we're gonna give you
the corner up on Payson.

51:38.753 --> 51:41.654
Used to be Bodie's old corner.
Now it's yours.

51:43.591 --> 51:45.246
Crew that up.
Run that shit.

51:45.394 --> 51:47.954
You get the points
on that shop.

51:49.832 --> 51:51.493
Then we got
this other thing.

51:55.104 --> 51:57.624
Yo, if I ain't
stepping on nothing,

51:57.772 --> 51:59.763
who was that
who dropped for you, yo?

52:04.813 --> 52:07.179
- Bug's daddy.
- Word?

52:26.466 --> 52:28.187
That's not how you spell
"paraphernalia."

52:28.335 --> 52:30.756
- How the fuck do you spell it?
- Hey, fellas.

52:30.905 --> 52:33.526
Not like that.
McNulty. Hey.

52:33.673 --> 52:35.028
You're here 4:00 to 12:00,
right?

52:35.176 --> 52:37.097
- You heard about Bodie?
- What about?

52:37.245 --> 52:38.865
- Bodie, from up Payson.
- Yeah yeah. What?

52:39.014 --> 52:41.601
Shot dead on his corner.

52:41.749 --> 52:44.269
Midnight shift caught it.
Check the readout.

52:44.417 --> 52:47.318
Sergeant,
get your ass in here.

52:50.190 --> 52:53.319
God damn it, Sergeant,
you're on the brink of insubordination.

53:04.538 --> 53:08.159
You call D.S.S. right now
and ship him out. That's an order.

53:08.307 --> 53:09.296
Lieutenant--

53:14.313 --> 53:18.537
I got $235, if it helps.

53:18.685 --> 53:20.939
How would that help?

53:21.087 --> 53:24.284
Maybe we can get a foster spot
like that-- pay somebody.

53:35.067 --> 53:37.422
This is tracking,
plain and simple.

53:37.571 --> 53:39.190
No, it's a
socialization process.

53:39.338 --> 53:42.026
But to any parent who complains,
you're still segregating them.

53:42.173 --> 53:44.027
But I mean...
it's for their benefit,

53:44.176 --> 53:46.531
and for the benefit of
the teachers trying to teach.

53:46.679 --> 53:49.667
And you're proposing to expand this
to every middle school?

53:49.815 --> 53:52.936
With enough grant money
and your support, yes.

53:53.083 --> 53:54.704
By September.

53:54.852 --> 53:56.939
But you wouldn't be teaching
test curriculum here?

53:57.088 --> 54:00.110
These would be the children
left behind, so to speak.

54:00.258 --> 54:01.645
Yeah, but as it is,
I mean,

54:01.794 --> 54:03.613
we're leaving
them all behind anyway.

54:03.762 --> 54:05.524
We just don't want
to admit it.

54:09.301 --> 54:10.988
- What we mean to say is--
- Gentlemen...

54:11.136 --> 54:13.331
we'll be in touch.

54:22.480 --> 54:24.201
So what, that's it?

54:24.349 --> 54:26.836
After a two-minute hearing,
they stick a fork in us?

54:26.985 --> 54:30.273
I'm a liability
in there, man.

54:30.421 --> 54:32.275
Seems like every time
I open my mouth in this town,

54:32.423 --> 54:34.611
I'm telling people something
they don't want to know.

54:34.759 --> 54:36.847
- It's not you. It's the process.
- The process?

54:36.996 --> 54:40.015
When we get the grant, we study
the problem, we propose solutions.

54:40.162 --> 54:41.683
If they listen, they listen.

54:41.832 --> 54:44.086
If they don't, it still
makes for great research.

54:44.234 --> 54:46.322
What we publish on this
is gonna get a lot of attention.

54:46.471 --> 54:47.857
From who?

54:48.005 --> 54:49.658
From other
researchers, academics.

54:49.807 --> 54:51.660
Academics?

54:51.809 --> 54:53.777
What, they gonna study
your study?

54:59.885 --> 55:01.543
When do this shit change?

55:03.654 --> 55:06.407
And you put him out, huh?

55:06.556 --> 55:08.511
He need to get hard.

55:08.659 --> 55:11.248
Well, if he out,
then he out.

55:11.395 --> 55:13.348
Oh, no, you're not.

55:13.496 --> 55:16.284
You ain't gonna take
my son away from me, not for this--

55:16.433 --> 55:18.587
Remember who the fuck
you talking to right here.

55:18.735 --> 55:21.023
Remember who I am.

55:21.172 --> 55:23.593
My word is still my word.

55:23.740 --> 55:25.826
In here, in Baltimore,

55:25.975 --> 55:29.063
and in any place you
can think of calling home,

55:29.210 --> 55:31.645
it'll be my word.
They'll find you.

55:33.215 --> 55:37.105
Man come down here to say my son
can be anything he damn please.

55:37.253 --> 55:39.221
Except a soldier.

55:41.658 --> 55:44.446
Yeah, well,
look at me up in here.

55:44.594 --> 55:46.148
Who the fuck
would want to be that

55:46.296 --> 55:48.388
if they could be
anything else, De'Londa?

55:49.765 --> 55:51.460
Hmm?

55:54.603 --> 55:56.892
So...

55:57.039 --> 55:58.903
did you cut me off too?

56:00.876 --> 56:04.107
You still got me.
We'll get by.

56:05.880 --> 56:08.636
But you gonna
let go of that boy.

56:08.785 --> 56:10.443
Bet that.

56:16.925 --> 56:18.946
Quien es?

56:19.094 --> 56:21.255
It's Omar, baby.

56:52.160 --> 56:53.780
For your bank?

56:53.929 --> 56:56.047
That's for
your pain, Butch.

56:56.195 --> 56:57.582
I be my own bank now.

56:57.731 --> 57:00.552
Hmm.
They ain't follow you?

57:00.701 --> 57:02.288
Nah.
Joe paid it my way.

57:02.435 --> 57:06.158
He had to admit my word
was better than his. You feel me?

57:06.307 --> 57:08.798
Let's go then.

57:19.952 --> 57:22.340
He is in the van,
in the garage

57:22.489 --> 57:24.776
in the back
of 2249 Polk Street.

57:24.925 --> 57:26.790
The key gonna be
in the cinderblock.

57:43.175 --> 57:46.737
You steal this much,
and this ain't over.

57:49.649 --> 57:51.446
This ain't over.

58:22.482 --> 58:24.369
Thing about that
Republican ass,

58:24.517 --> 58:27.543
it's not the flesh of
his political fathers.

58:49.475 --> 58:51.464
Jesus.

58:52.643 --> 58:54.497
You left it
on the table.

58:54.645 --> 58:56.499
Smug son of a bitch.

58:56.647 --> 58:59.969
He was gonna
make me beg,

59:00.118 --> 59:01.972
then call
a press conference

59:02.120 --> 59:04.574
so the world could see me
on my knees.

59:04.722 --> 59:07.410
Don't worry.

59:07.558 --> 59:09.513
Two years,

59:09.661 --> 59:11.652
and we'll make him pay.

59:14.364 --> 59:15.617
Icicle, icicle!

59:15.765 --> 59:17.096
Got those icicles!

59:21.105 --> 59:22.834
Shakedown!

59:27.244 --> 59:28.398
Corner's indicted.

59:28.547 --> 59:30.166
Go on. Get.

59:30.314 --> 59:32.806
Except you, motherfucker.
On the wall.

59:36.587 --> 59:39.241
Sorry about Bodie.

59:39.389 --> 59:40.809
I ain't jacking you up.

59:40.958 --> 59:42.677
I'm trying to do right
for your boy.

59:42.826 --> 59:46.047
- Who dropped him?
- Y'all did.

59:46.196 --> 59:49.351
They took him out 'cause
he was talking to y'all.

59:49.499 --> 59:52.254
Word is they seen him with the police
down at Central Booking.

59:52.403 --> 59:55.858
So cuff me or kick my ass
off this corner

59:56.005 --> 59:58.497
before you do me the same.

01:00:10.486 --> 01:00:13.319
Hey, Duquan.

01:00:15.659 --> 01:00:17.279
Don't you need
to be at Douglass?

01:00:17.427 --> 01:00:21.083
I'm on my way there, yeah.

01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:22.785
Where's your book bag?

01:00:22.931 --> 01:00:25.628
Oh, it's-- I'm gonna stop
past the house and get it.

01:00:30.672 --> 01:00:34.574
It's a present
for all you did.

01:00:37.547 --> 01:00:39.034
It's for your desk.

01:00:39.181 --> 01:00:40.969
That's great, Duquan.

01:00:41.116 --> 01:00:43.881
Thanks.

01:00:46.387 --> 01:00:48.508
Stop past anytime,

01:00:48.656 --> 01:00:50.556
Iet me know
how it's going with you.

01:00:52.327 --> 01:00:53.817
Okay.

01:01:02.504 --> 01:01:05.727
- But I ain't want to go back.
- Program's ending, Zenobia.

01:01:05.874 --> 01:01:08.697
Yeah, boy.
Back to gen pop.

01:01:08.842 --> 01:01:10.897
Yes.

01:01:11.045 --> 01:01:13.399
Pack my bags.

01:01:13.547 --> 01:01:14.868
What about you?

01:01:15.016 --> 01:01:18.418
I mean, this was all right...

01:01:22.223 --> 01:01:23.713
but maybe it's time.

01:01:30.932 --> 01:01:32.518
Why are you up?

01:01:32.665 --> 01:01:35.054
You're working
4:00 to 12:00.

01:01:35.201 --> 01:01:38.257
What's the matter?

01:01:38.406 --> 01:01:40.066
Something with these bodies.

01:01:41.375 --> 01:01:45.198
Lester and them
are getting up on it.

01:01:45.346 --> 01:01:47.867
It's under Daniels.

01:01:48.015 --> 01:01:50.838
He's got suction now.

01:01:50.985 --> 01:01:52.539
He can deliver.

01:01:52.688 --> 01:01:55.240
You want in.

01:01:55.388 --> 01:01:57.876
I just feel like
I owe it now.

01:01:58.024 --> 01:01:59.812
To who?

01:01:59.959 --> 01:02:01.547
To this kid.

01:02:01.696 --> 01:02:03.750
Corner kid.

01:02:03.897 --> 01:02:06.585
Getting ready
to turn him, you know,

01:02:06.733 --> 01:02:09.224
wrap him up and give him
to Lester as a present.

01:02:10.437 --> 01:02:12.191
He one of the bodies
in the houses?

01:02:12.338 --> 01:02:14.705
No, they dropped him
in the street.

01:02:17.611 --> 01:02:19.630
Maybe I'd be different,
you know?

01:02:19.778 --> 01:02:21.268
Different?

01:02:22.881 --> 01:02:25.336
Yeah, no more of the...

01:02:25.485 --> 01:02:27.338
drinking and the whoring
and all that.

01:02:27.487 --> 01:02:28.977
All that anger.

01:02:33.226 --> 01:02:35.491
'Cause I'm better now
here with you.

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.622
No more playing "Jimmy Bust Balls"
with the world.

01:02:44.770 --> 01:02:46.761
"Jimmy Bust Balls"?

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:51.633
I swear to God, Beadie,
that son of a bitch nearly killed me.

01:03:15.033 --> 01:03:16.557
It's okay.

01:03:17.936 --> 01:03:20.692
- What?
- You tried.

01:03:20.839 --> 01:03:22.329
You don't need to feel bad.

01:03:25.445 --> 01:03:27.070
Thanks.

01:03:46.664 --> 01:03:48.154
All right, Randy,
this way.

01:04:26.503 --> 01:04:28.630
Take that top bunk
over there.

01:04:43.719 --> 01:04:45.915
Five-0.

01:05:28.296 --> 01:05:30.629
Are you sure?

01:05:32.634 --> 01:05:34.822
I'm not asking
'cause I can't use you.

01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:36.656
I'm asking for your sake.

01:05:36.805 --> 01:05:38.192
I think I can do this

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:41.429
and keep myself
away from myself,

01:05:41.577 --> 01:05:43.238
if that makes any sense.

01:05:54.055 --> 01:05:55.509
But I gotta tell you,

01:05:55.657 --> 01:05:57.543
we're not gonna get
Marlo Stanfield

01:05:57.692 --> 01:05:59.880
or anyone else above the street,
not on street rips.

01:06:00.028 --> 01:06:01.481
What do you suggest?

01:06:01.629 --> 01:06:03.984
Either a wide C.I.
or a Title lll.

01:06:04.132 --> 01:06:06.453
That's what makes this case.

01:06:06.601 --> 01:06:09.020
You sure?

01:06:09.169 --> 01:06:11.329
Maybe you do this fast
and clean and simple.

01:06:14.074 --> 01:06:16.065
Then you don't
do it at all.

01:06:17.077 --> 01:06:19.633
Chain of command, Colonel.

01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:22.002
How in the hell do we
kick up percentages

01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:23.870
in math
and reading both?

01:06:24.018 --> 01:06:26.039
You believe the numbers?

01:06:26.187 --> 01:06:29.376
38% proficient.
8% advanced.

01:06:29.525 --> 01:06:31.410
What?

01:06:31.558 --> 01:06:34.747
"Proficient" means they're
at least two grades below their level.

01:06:34.895 --> 01:06:39.118
"Advanced" can mean
they're at grade level or a year below.

01:06:39.266 --> 01:06:41.720
They score 'em
like that, and...

01:06:41.869 --> 01:06:45.269
they say we're
making progress.

01:06:46.273 --> 01:06:47.693
Okay. I'm still learning.

01:06:47.841 --> 01:06:49.862
Nah, you're gonna be fine.

01:06:50.010 --> 01:06:52.899
Albert, Zenobia, Namond,

01:06:53.046 --> 01:06:54.732
good to have you
back with us.

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.439
Yeah. Your worst nightmare
come right back on you.

01:07:02.989 --> 01:07:04.719
Say, no,
I'm just foolin'.

01:07:06.492 --> 01:07:09.257
Okay.
Everyone open to 121.

01:07:14.601 --> 01:07:16.455
Who figured out
the first problem?

01:07:16.602 --> 01:07:19.157
- Kareem?
- 164.

01:07:19.304 --> 01:07:21.426
Correct.
How'd you get it?

01:07:21.574 --> 01:07:24.941
- Don't know.
- Come. Show us.

01:07:26.113 --> 01:07:29.634
Just when you
think you're done.

01:07:29.781 --> 01:07:34.005
- What's that one? 20?
- 22.

01:07:34.152 --> 01:07:36.374
Anybody heard from Bunk?

01:07:36.522 --> 01:07:40.309
Ballistics say the guns match
to nothing. Opened and closed.

01:07:40.458 --> 01:07:42.078
And they cleaned
the prints.

01:07:42.226 --> 01:07:45.949
Well, maybe
we find a witness.

01:07:46.097 --> 01:07:50.053
Maybe trace lab gives us
a hair or splatter or something.

01:07:50.201 --> 01:07:52.790
But short of that,
we're gonna have to go proactive.

01:07:52.938 --> 01:07:54.893
Where are you
on the new body?

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:56.561
Back to square one.

01:07:56.709 --> 01:07:58.563
We're in here
for the long haul.

01:07:58.711 --> 01:08:01.432
Colonel, how'd you happen
to pick this place for us to stage?

01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:03.866
- Lemel?
- Hmm.

01:08:04.014 --> 01:08:05.868
They closed it
a few years back,

01:08:06.016 --> 01:08:08.805
and I knew it was near
a lot of our crime scenes.

01:08:08.953 --> 01:08:10.807
I went to school here

01:08:10.955 --> 01:08:12.910
back in the day.

01:08:13.058 --> 01:08:15.652
Got a decent education,
now that I think on it.

01:08:40.651 --> 01:08:43.206
You try and talk to him?

01:08:43.354 --> 01:08:44.908
Didn't know what to say.

01:08:45.055 --> 01:08:48.412
Only heard from
my sergeant this morning.

01:08:48.558 --> 01:08:50.245
Guess I missed
the 24 they wrote on it.

01:08:50.394 --> 01:08:52.247
And he really tried
to do himself?

01:08:52.395 --> 01:08:54.149
It wasn't just
for show or nothing?

01:08:54.298 --> 01:08:58.421
Bub's got some problems,
but insincerity ain't one of them.

01:08:58.569 --> 01:09:00.790
Shame's some
tricky shit, ain't it?

01:09:00.937 --> 01:09:02.825
Makes you feel like
you want to change,

01:09:02.971 --> 01:09:05.961
and then beats you back down
when think you can't.

01:09:06.109 --> 01:09:08.064
When was the last time
y'all talked?

01:09:08.212 --> 01:09:10.066
More than a couple of years,

01:09:10.214 --> 01:09:13.500
since he last got
on the wagon, I think.

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:15.336
If he's up in D ward,

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:17.782
he's cleaner than
a motherfucker right now.

01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:55.677
You coming?

01:09:55.825 --> 01:09:58.189
Maybe later.

01:10:45.005 --> 01:10:47.234
Can't believe he'd leave
that money on the table.

01:10:48.241 --> 01:10:53.266
- Why not?
- School. Kids.

01:10:53.414 --> 01:10:54.834
Shit.

01:10:54.982 --> 01:10:57.070
You ain't done enough
of this here, I suppose.

01:10:57.218 --> 01:11:00.707
They always disappoint.

01:11:00.855 --> 01:11:04.410
Closer you get,
more you look--

01:11:04.559 --> 01:11:06.684
all of them.

01:11:07.961 --> 01:11:10.982
Who you going with
next year?

01:11:11.131 --> 01:11:14.754
If he tries for Elijah's seat,
I might stay with Royce.

01:11:14.902 --> 01:11:17.857
If not, there's this young buck
out in Salisbury

01:11:18.004 --> 01:11:20.802
thinks he can snatch up
the First District seat.

01:11:22.775 --> 01:11:24.505
Hmm.

01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:29.943
Mistletoe. Come get 'em.

01:11:35.153 --> 01:11:37.587
Mistletoe!

01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:03.508
You can look him
in the eye now.

01:12:05.617 --> 01:12:07.471
No matter who he is
or what he's done,

01:12:07.619 --> 01:12:09.247
you look him
right in the eye.

01:12:25.937 --> 01:12:27.461
I'm still your father.

01:14:06.469 --> 01:14:09.098
What you want?

01:14:48.911 --> 01:14:50.242
Right to the body.

01:14:52.481 --> 01:14:54.670
That's right. Keep it moving.
Where your eyes at?

01:14:54.818 --> 01:14:56.544
Where you looking--
what you looking at?

01:15:07.828 --> 01:15:09.249
Hey!

01:15:09.397 --> 01:15:12.485
You cannot be out here.

01:15:12.633 --> 01:15:14.521
Y'all need to find
something constructive

01:15:14.670 --> 01:15:16.500
to do with yourselves.
Go on.

01:15:31.085 --> 01:15:34.179
Michael.

01:15:34.689 --> 01:15:36.316
Michael.

01:15:38.226 --> 01:15:40.388
The gun.

01:16:14.094 --> 01:16:16.722
Na', you're
gonna be late.

01:16:19.298 --> 01:16:20.960
Go on. Go.

01:16:33.111 --> 01:16:35.410
Boy, where's your plate?

01:17:02.608 --> 01:17:06.373
Yo, Tyrell, wait up.
