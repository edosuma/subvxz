00:55.098 --> 00:56.665
[phone ringing]

00:59.320 --> 01:00.669
[person] Hello!

01:00.843 --> 01:03.367
Chuck Farnsworth?
I'’m Axel Bates.

01:03.541 --> 01:05.674
You'’re also on
with my partners,
Anders, Bradley and Zeke.

01:05.848 --> 01:08.981
[Chuck] Oh, my God.
Thank you so much
for calling me back!

01:09.156 --> 01:11.810
[Axel] I understand
your daughter, Brooke,
was taken 24 hours ago

01:11.984 --> 01:14.161
on a business trip with
your oil company in Mexico.

01:14.335 --> 01:15.684
[Chuck] Yes!

01:15.858 --> 01:17.338
I'’ll pay you guys
whatever you want.

01:17.512 --> 01:20.297
You just bring
my baby girl home alive.

01:22.734 --> 01:25.085
[gunfire in distance][panting]

01:26.912 --> 01:28.392
I-- I can'’t see anything.

01:28.566 --> 01:31.743
Brooke, I'’m Cal.
We'’re here to take you home.

01:31.917 --> 01:33.789
Lean forward.
I'’m gonna cut you loose.

01:34.659 --> 01:37.053
It'’s okay. It'’s okay.

01:38.489 --> 01:40.056
Stand up.

01:40.230 --> 01:42.885
Grab my vest.
Don'’t let go.

01:44.408 --> 01:45.496
[grunts]

02:00.642 --> 02:02.078
[grunts]

02:30.846 --> 02:32.152
[grunts]

02:34.545 --> 02:35.546
Clear!

03:01.006 --> 03:02.747
Zeke, get ready to go.

03:02.921 --> 03:05.185
Where'’s Axel and Bradley?[Cal] They'’re right behind us.

03:07.622 --> 03:09.276
[gasping]

03:11.713 --> 03:12.975
[grunts]

03:13.149 --> 03:14.455
[screams]

03:16.196 --> 03:17.588
I'’m hit.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.112
I got you, brother.

03:25.553 --> 03:26.380
[groans]

03:27.642 --> 03:29.252
[Cal] Get in the van!

03:30.514 --> 03:32.081
Bradley, drive!

03:32.255 --> 03:33.561
[Bradley] Where'’s Zeke?

03:33.735 --> 03:36.085
[gunfire]

03:38.696 --> 03:39.741
[grunts]

03:44.702 --> 03:46.704
[Cal] Axel, no!

03:57.846 --> 03:59.935
[engine revs]

04:01.458 --> 04:02.546
[Cal] Drive!

04:03.330 --> 04:04.679
[Bradley] What'’s happening?

04:05.680 --> 04:06.898
Where'’s Axel?

04:08.552 --> 04:10.946
We gotta go back to get him.We can'’t!

04:13.078 --> 04:14.515
I'’m sorry, brother.

04:15.472 --> 04:18.040
[tires squealing]

05:27.022 --> 05:28.153
[horse blusters]

06:33.218 --> 06:35.743
Could have saved you the trip.
I'’m still retired.

06:37.527 --> 06:39.834
Well, so am I.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.491
You just come
all the way up here
to say hi?

06:44.665 --> 06:48.843
A guy'’s not allowed to
come check in on his favorite
cousin from time to time?

06:51.585 --> 06:54.283
You up for a beer?
I got a couple.

06:54.457 --> 06:56.154
Oh, yeah. Love one.

07:00.507 --> 07:03.248
Pretty out here.[beer caps pop]

07:09.211 --> 07:10.212
Quiet.

07:11.300 --> 07:13.433
Just the way I like it.Thank you.

07:21.658 --> 07:23.486
Ever talk to Anders?

07:25.619 --> 07:28.752
No. Last I heard,
he was beach hopping
in Thailand.

07:28.926 --> 07:31.015
That was
last spring though.

07:31.189 --> 07:34.541
Right.
That'’s what I'’d heard too.

07:34.715 --> 07:37.413
The number I had for him,
there'’s no answer.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.939
I was trying to invite him
to my wedding.

07:46.509 --> 07:48.032
Getting married?

07:48.206 --> 07:51.122
I am,
if you can believe that.

07:53.690 --> 07:55.300
Uh, cheers to that.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.563
Thank you.

07:57.999 --> 08:00.567
Who'’s the unlucky lady?
Anyone I know?

08:02.830 --> 08:04.092
You do.

08:04.962 --> 08:06.573
Remember Brooke?

08:09.576 --> 08:11.099
The Brooke from...

08:11.882 --> 08:13.493
That'’s the one.

08:15.538 --> 08:16.670
Fuck.

08:18.193 --> 08:20.848
Uh, but, uh, congrats.

08:22.153 --> 08:25.200
I guess
losing Axel and Zeke
wasn'’t for nothing.

08:27.463 --> 08:28.986
Yeah.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.598
It was rough, but they knew
what they were getting into.

08:31.772 --> 08:33.687
They knew the risks
of the job.

08:34.818 --> 08:35.906
Yeah.

08:36.603 --> 08:38.213
We all did.

08:45.263 --> 08:47.614
I want you
to be my best man.

08:49.093 --> 08:50.921
What do you say?

08:57.580 --> 09:00.191
Yeah.
I'’ll be there for you.

09:01.889 --> 09:03.368
Thanks.

09:41.015 --> 09:44.018
Oh, my God.
There'’s my baby.[laughs]

09:44.192 --> 09:45.497
Dad!There'’s my girl.

09:45.672 --> 09:47.543
Look at you.

09:47.717 --> 09:50.067
Dad.It'’s so good to see you.

09:50.241 --> 09:52.069
So good.

09:52.243 --> 09:55.377
You have time to
call this off, right?[both chuckle]

09:55.551 --> 09:57.945
The heart wants
what the heart wants.

09:58.119 --> 10:00.425
Didn'’t your heart
want it four times?

10:02.036 --> 10:04.038
Okay. Where'’s Cal?[chuckles]

10:04.212 --> 10:06.431
He'’s parking the car
and bringing the bags in.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.086
I see you still have
your entourage.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.872
[Chuck] Yeah.

10:12.046 --> 10:14.309
After what happened to you,
you think I'’m gonna leave home
without them?

10:14.483 --> 10:15.876
You shouldn'’t either.

10:16.050 --> 10:17.225
I have Cal.

10:17.399 --> 10:19.270
And that'’s a long way
from here.

10:19.444 --> 10:21.359
Unfortunately, people
still know I'’ve got money.

10:21.533 --> 10:22.752
Yeah, '’cause
you don'’t hide it.

10:22.926 --> 10:24.493
[laughs]

10:24.667 --> 10:27.061
Nothing but the best
for my baby girl, right?I mean...

10:27.235 --> 10:29.977
I thought
I was your baby girl.[Chuck chuckles]

10:30.151 --> 10:32.196
Oh, you almost look
as good as me.

10:32.370 --> 10:34.198
[Chuck clears throat]

10:34.372 --> 10:36.418
This weekend'’s
about your sister.

10:36.592 --> 10:38.463
Hi, Daddy.Hey, baby doll.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.730
Welcome, everyone.
I hope you all had
a pleasant journey in.

10:43.904 --> 10:46.254
Yes, we did.
Thank you.Oh, wonderful.

10:46.428 --> 10:48.560
The rest of the hotel guests
are checking out,

10:48.735 --> 10:52.216
which means you and
your wedding party will have
the entire resort to yourselves

10:52.390 --> 10:54.131
for the remainder
of the weekend.

10:54.305 --> 10:56.351
Seriously, Dad?Nothing but the best.

10:57.482 --> 10:59.833
Is there any cell service here?

11:00.007 --> 11:04.054
Uh, actually, you'’ll find that
a few days out here is like
taking a walk back in time.

11:04.228 --> 11:06.709
That'’s why presidents
and dignitaries
from around the world

11:06.883 --> 11:09.843
not only enjoy our seclusion
and accommodations,

11:10.017 --> 11:11.845
but also come back
for repeat visits.

11:12.019 --> 11:14.586
So there'’s no cell service?[Chuck chuckles]

11:14.761 --> 11:19.374
No. But we do have Wi-Fi
and plenty of beautiful
mountain views.

11:19.548 --> 11:23.726
Make no mistake, this is
a weekend that you and your
guests will never forget.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.641
If you'’ll follow me,
I'’ll give you a tour.

11:25.815 --> 11:28.296
Go on over here.
That'’s okay.

11:28.470 --> 11:31.125
Now, as you can see,
we'’re surrounded by
pristine wilderness.

11:31.299 --> 11:33.649
We have
a 36-hole golf course,

11:33.823 --> 11:36.478
15 miles of beautiful
hiking trails.

11:36.652 --> 11:40.003
We also have
a spa on the grounds.
Every treatment imaginable.

11:40.177 --> 11:42.136
[sister]
What celebrities visited here?

11:42.310 --> 11:45.617
[manager] Oh, I'’m not able
to disclose exactly who...[elevator dings]

11:51.536 --> 11:52.929
Guess I found
the right place.[chuckles]

11:53.103 --> 11:56.106
Bradley, hey.Hey.

11:56.977 --> 11:58.456
I'’m so glad you'’re here.

11:58.630 --> 12:00.328
Ah, wouldn'’t miss it.

12:02.634 --> 12:04.506
Uh... [chuckles]

12:04.680 --> 12:07.248
You could have almost
gotten married at my place
in the mountains.

12:07.422 --> 12:09.641
I don'’t have a lake
like that though.[chuckles]

12:09.816 --> 12:12.601
Oh, this is gorgeous.

12:12.775 --> 12:14.864
Hey, my dad'’s here.
You wanna come say hi?

12:16.866 --> 12:18.738
Yeah. I suppose I should.

12:22.872 --> 12:24.787
Over here
is our five-star restaurant,

12:24.961 --> 12:27.747
which will be hosting
your rehearsal dinner
later this evening.

12:29.183 --> 12:30.575
Yes!

12:30.750 --> 12:33.143
[gasps] This is where
your ceremony is gonna be.

12:33.317 --> 12:35.580
Sorry.Chuck,
good to see you again.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.147
Bradley, good to see you.

12:37.321 --> 12:38.975
Especially on
better circumstances,
you know?

12:39.149 --> 12:40.498
Right.Give me just a minute.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.587
Let me finish right here,
and I'’ll be back.

12:42.762 --> 12:43.632
Thanks.

12:44.589 --> 12:46.330
Oh, this is my sister.

12:46.504 --> 12:49.116
Uh, Hailey, right?And the maid of honor.

12:50.204 --> 12:52.380
Bradley. The best man.

12:52.554 --> 12:54.077
Nice to meet you.

12:54.251 --> 12:55.687
You too.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.125
[Chuck] You'’ve exceeded
all my expectations.

12:58.299 --> 13:01.345
Wonderful. Well, I'’ll make sure
our staff has everything
set up beautifully

13:01.519 --> 13:03.217
for the big celebration
in the morning.

13:03.391 --> 13:06.002
Now, if you'’ll all follow me,
we'’ll head to the casino.

13:12.704 --> 13:14.097
It'’s great.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.188
[keypad beeping]

14:06.758 --> 14:09.718
All right. We got slots,
table games, you know,
fun for the whole family.

14:09.892 --> 14:12.242
And I know
it looks busy right now,
but like I said,

14:12.416 --> 14:14.592
this entire casino
will be completely empty

14:14.766 --> 14:17.813
and only available to you
and your guests later today
and throughout the weekend.

14:17.987 --> 14:21.208
Somebody was telling me
this place had a safe room.

14:21.382 --> 14:24.080
Oh, um, yeah, we do.I'’d like to see it.

14:24.254 --> 14:26.866
Oh, no. It'’s really
nothing you would ever need.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.042
Where is it?

14:29.216 --> 14:31.696
Um, yes, sir. Yeah.
It'’s right this way.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.003
[slot machines chiming]

14:39.835 --> 14:41.837
[quiet music playing
on speakers]

14:49.410 --> 14:52.239
You know, I'’m out there
in the lobby,

14:52.413 --> 14:54.284
and I'’m listening
to this good-lookin'’ woman

14:54.458 --> 14:57.070
talk about this big, tall,
handsome blond guy

14:57.244 --> 15:00.682
she saw sittin'’ all alone
at the bar.

15:00.856 --> 15:03.990
And as I listen
to her describe the guy,
I think to myself,

15:04.860 --> 15:06.296
"I bet I know him."

15:07.384 --> 15:08.908
And I do.

15:09.734 --> 15:11.345
You didn'’t take the tour?

15:11.519 --> 15:16.263
No. I'’m... taking the tour
of bourbon country.

15:16.437 --> 15:18.656
I see that.It'’s great to see you,
brother.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.571
Good to see you too.Hey.

15:21.268 --> 15:22.791
[sighs]

15:24.967 --> 15:26.838
I wasn'’t sure
you'’d make it.

15:27.013 --> 15:30.320
Hell, I wasn'’t even sure
I had the right number.

15:30.494 --> 15:34.759
Yeah, look, I--
I still check my messages
once in a while. It'’s--

15:34.934 --> 15:37.545
In some countries,
it'’s harder than others,
you know?

15:39.329 --> 15:41.288
Retirement
looks good on you.

15:43.072 --> 15:45.205
It does.Sun, sand.

15:45.379 --> 15:46.467
Right.

15:46.641 --> 15:48.860
Women. Well, you know.

15:49.035 --> 15:52.690
There you have it.Uh, Thailand. [chuckles]

15:52.864 --> 15:56.172
Ma'’am,
I'’ll do the same, please.

16:02.222 --> 16:03.397
Thank you.

16:04.615 --> 16:05.877
Thanks for coming.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.228
I mean it.

16:11.666 --> 16:12.884
Cheers.[glasses clink]

16:18.978 --> 16:22.329
Been kind of
a long, hard road,
hasn'’t it, buddy?

16:23.678 --> 16:24.722
Yeah.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.029
Yeah, remember--

16:27.203 --> 16:28.857
remember that time
in Afghanistan

16:29.031 --> 16:33.644
we got cut into that bottle
of confiscated grappa?

16:33.818 --> 16:36.734
I thought my fuckin'’ teeth
were gonna fall out
from that stuff.

16:36.908 --> 16:39.041
Well, you became
a man that day.Bullshit!

16:39.215 --> 16:43.045
[chuckles] I--
I think I'’d earned my stripes
well before that night.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.093
Stuck in the sand, drunk.

16:48.964 --> 16:51.010
It was an impossible
situation.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.013
Next morning, we...

16:55.797 --> 16:57.755
did what we had to do.

16:59.627 --> 17:01.020
Yeah.

17:03.370 --> 17:05.546
That, I wouldn'’t mind
forgettin'’.

17:06.982 --> 17:07.983
Yeah.

17:08.897 --> 17:10.855
That'’s why I drink
to pass out.

17:11.639 --> 17:12.596
[chuckles]

17:12.770 --> 17:14.598
Helps me to forget,
I guess.

17:15.947 --> 17:19.038
I guess Brooke'’s
my vice now.

17:19.212 --> 17:23.999
We kind of help each other
get through the hard times
together.

17:24.173 --> 17:25.435
Mmm.

17:25.609 --> 17:28.960
Well, in that case,
if Brooke is your vice,

17:30.701 --> 17:32.268
then this is my Brooke.

17:32.442 --> 17:34.836
Cheers. Congrats.

17:35.967 --> 17:38.100
Missed you.Missed you too.

17:44.802 --> 17:46.630
[door opens]All right, follow me this way.

17:46.804 --> 17:48.980
This is where we, uh,
make all the magic happen.

17:49.155 --> 17:50.460
Don'’t mind the mess.

17:50.634 --> 17:52.462
So our, uh, staff cafeteria
is back that way,

17:52.636 --> 17:54.769
and the admin offices
are at the end of the hall.

17:54.943 --> 17:57.641
Yeah. Well, you know,
that'’s cool, but I just
wanna see the safe room.

17:57.815 --> 18:00.296
Ah, yes, well,
it'’s actually, um--
kind of doubles as two rooms.

18:00.470 --> 18:02.907
It'’s our high-tech security room
and it acts as a safe room,

18:03.082 --> 18:05.780
which we have been
fortunate enough
to never have had to use.

18:05.954 --> 18:07.869
All right.
Now, there are two ways in.

18:08.043 --> 18:11.090
One is typing in the code
that only our security team
and myself know.

18:11.264 --> 18:14.789
The other is through
the security guard,
who'’s always stationed inside.

18:14.963 --> 18:17.531
They monitor the entire resort
at all times.

18:18.575 --> 18:19.663
Then open the door.

18:20.621 --> 18:22.318
Yeah.[keypad beeps]

18:27.062 --> 18:29.586
[electronic lock buzzes]

18:30.892 --> 18:32.198
Right this way.

18:33.503 --> 18:35.288
Now, our monitors
are back here in the cage.

18:35.462 --> 18:38.291
Please don'’t touch anything.

18:38.465 --> 18:40.423
All right.
Come on in, guys.

18:40.597 --> 18:43.165
So these cameras
just capture everything.
It'’s all state-of-the-art.

18:43.339 --> 18:45.298
If somebody drops
a quarter on the ground,

18:45.472 --> 18:47.778
we can zoom in and tell you
what year it was printed.

18:49.258 --> 18:50.129
No.

18:51.521 --> 18:53.610
What?Absolutely not.

18:54.611 --> 18:55.612
[scoffs]

18:58.180 --> 19:02.706
Yeah, that guy was a real prick.
We all wanted to kill him.[laughs]

19:02.880 --> 19:05.013
Too bad
he was a colonel.Right.

19:05.187 --> 19:06.797
No, lieutenant colonel.

19:06.971 --> 19:08.408
Yeah. Yeah.

19:08.582 --> 19:11.106
Yeah,
he was from Connecticut.[both chuckle]

19:12.368 --> 19:14.588
There'’s my handsome man.

19:14.762 --> 19:16.372
Hey.Well, wait, wait, wait.

19:16.546 --> 19:18.592
That'’s what you'’re marrying?
This guy?

19:18.766 --> 19:20.159
[chuckles]

19:21.508 --> 19:23.205
Thanks for coming,
Anders.

19:23.379 --> 19:27.427
[clears throat] Yeah.I, uh, know it means a lot
to this guy.

19:29.037 --> 19:30.778
That'’s great.

19:30.952 --> 19:35.261
Yeah, it'’s great. All right.
Well, you guys, um, have fun.

19:36.566 --> 19:37.567
[grunts]

19:39.134 --> 19:41.963
I didn'’t interrupt
anything, did I?No, no.

19:42.137 --> 19:45.445
Just, uh,
takes a little while
to get to know him.

19:45.619 --> 19:46.620
That'’s all.

19:47.577 --> 19:49.188
Let'’s go cruise around.Yes.

19:55.759 --> 19:58.414
[lever pulls][slot machine chimes]

20:01.591 --> 20:02.766
[exhales]

[chimes]

20:17.694 --> 20:18.695
[chimes]

20:23.700 --> 20:24.745
Oh.

20:26.486 --> 20:27.791
How you feeling, baby?

20:27.965 --> 20:30.403
Me? I'’m pretty good.

20:30.577 --> 20:33.667
I was honestly,
I think, more nervous
couple of months ago.

20:33.841 --> 20:35.538
Now I'’m just excited.

20:35.712 --> 20:38.454
I think that'’s '’cause
of how much I love you.

20:38.628 --> 20:40.761
This is why I make
all the big decisions.

20:40.935 --> 20:43.154
Damn right.[chuckles]

20:45.548 --> 20:47.246
Okay,
let'’s make a promise.

20:47.420 --> 20:51.206
For our first anniversary,
we go someplace tropical,
right?

20:51.380 --> 20:53.556
Where you can actually
play golf outside.

20:55.689 --> 20:58.605
I just wonder if I might
have made a mistake.

20:59.780 --> 21:00.998
Excuse me?[hits ball]

21:04.045 --> 21:06.743
You think I should have
made Anders my best man?

21:08.092 --> 21:09.224
Come on, honey.

21:10.660 --> 21:13.794
We talked about this.
Get it out of your head.

21:14.838 --> 21:16.579
This weekend is about us.

21:20.670 --> 21:23.543
You'’re right.
You'’re right.Hmm?

21:24.631 --> 21:26.067
But, hey,

21:26.241 --> 21:28.199
if anything
ever happens to me,

21:29.853 --> 21:31.594
he'’ll be there
to protect you.

21:33.857 --> 21:35.163
I like you.

21:39.254 --> 21:40.603
All right. Let'’s see it.Okay.

21:40.777 --> 21:42.126
You'’ve had
a couple of lessons.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.519
Okay, wait. Okay.

21:43.693 --> 21:45.173
Ready?Step one.

21:46.305 --> 21:49.699
And... batter up.

21:49.873 --> 21:51.135
This?

21:52.876 --> 21:57.620
Yeah, that'’s good for baseball,
but for golf, not so great.[laughs]

21:57.794 --> 21:58.795
Why--

21:58.969 --> 22:00.319
Feel like a club pro here.Yep.

22:00.493 --> 22:04.192
Okay, Miss Farnsworth,
soon-to-be Gray.

22:04.366 --> 22:06.281
You just get in there.

22:06.455 --> 22:08.022
Getting the grip.

22:08.196 --> 22:10.851
Put that left hand down
like that.

22:11.025 --> 22:13.201
Cover it up
with your right hand.

22:14.507 --> 22:18.075
Bring it back slowly,
and then...

22:19.599 --> 22:21.470
Uh, I'’m sorry.
I thought this was
a golf lesson.

22:21.644 --> 22:25.431
Ma'’am, I don'’t know
what came over me.
I-I apologize.

22:25.605 --> 22:28.259
Uh, here'’s what
I'’m gonna do.

22:28.434 --> 22:32.481
I'’m gonna give you the lesson
for free as long as you
don'’t tell my boss.

22:32.655 --> 22:34.353
[chuckles]

22:34.527 --> 22:35.919
Okay,
let'’s see a good swing now.

22:36.093 --> 22:37.007
Concentrate.Okay.

22:37.181 --> 22:40.968
[lounge piano music playing]

22:41.142 --> 22:43.013
[chattering]

22:47.148 --> 22:49.759
My man.
Good to see you.

22:51.239 --> 22:52.109
[guest]
Wonderful.

22:53.546 --> 22:55.069
[laughing]

23:00.814 --> 23:02.424
Yes?

23:02.598 --> 23:04.426
All right. Now, look...
[clears throat]

23:04.600 --> 23:08.125
I'’m gonna give you some advice,
not that you'’re asking for it.

23:08.299 --> 23:12.260
Have fun. Have a great weekend,
but be careful, you know.

23:12.434 --> 23:14.001
She'’ll break your heart.

23:14.175 --> 23:15.263
Got it.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.265
Mind if I play a bit?

23:17.439 --> 23:18.527
Relax.

23:23.967 --> 23:25.055
All right.

23:25.229 --> 23:26.666
[gentle piano music playing]

23:26.840 --> 23:28.058
[chuckles]

23:28.232 --> 23:29.364
All right.

23:38.895 --> 23:40.767
I always just thought
that was a pickup line,

23:40.941 --> 23:42.986
when he said
he could play the piano.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.206
Who knew?Not bad.

23:45.380 --> 23:46.860
[laughing]

23:47.034 --> 23:48.688
Oh, no!

23:48.862 --> 23:50.516
You'’re pretty talented.

23:51.386 --> 23:53.083
Oh, yeah? You think so?

23:53.997 --> 23:55.216
I don'’t know.

23:57.348 --> 23:58.872
[clears throat]

23:59.742 --> 24:01.091
Oh.

24:01.265 --> 24:02.832
One more thing.

24:03.006 --> 24:04.965
Need you to hold on
to this for me.

24:06.314 --> 24:08.359
Guard it with your life.

24:09.926 --> 24:12.842
All right?
With your life.

24:13.016 --> 24:14.191
I got it.

24:21.242 --> 24:24.898
That is a very big
responsibility.

24:26.290 --> 24:28.118
Fancy meeting you here.

24:33.820 --> 24:35.343
So, what'’s your deal?

24:36.823 --> 24:38.041
You and Cal.

24:38.825 --> 24:40.435
Oh, uh, cousins.

24:40.609 --> 24:42.350
Our moms are sisters.

24:42.524 --> 24:43.569
Huh.

24:44.744 --> 24:47.137
You two don'’t have
a lot of family.

24:47.311 --> 24:49.183
Are any of your relatives
joining?

24:50.184 --> 24:51.446
No.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.927
Probably better that way.
We'’re--

24:54.101 --> 24:58.192
Well, our family is
more likely to be the help
than the ones getting help.

24:59.193 --> 25:01.108
Guess you could say
we'’re low-key.

25:02.762 --> 25:04.154
I like low-key.

25:07.375 --> 25:08.419
Do you, though?

25:10.073 --> 25:11.945
Okay, burn.

25:12.119 --> 25:13.642
[laughs]

25:13.816 --> 25:15.078
Sorry.
Cal told me that...

25:17.254 --> 25:20.649
I should, uh,
keep my eye on you.

25:22.216 --> 25:23.522
In what way?

25:26.394 --> 25:27.656
I don'’t know.

25:28.744 --> 25:33.183
So I guess you won'’t
be joining me then.

25:34.924 --> 25:35.925
Too bad.

25:42.671 --> 25:43.890
Mmm.

25:44.891 --> 25:47.023
[piano music continues]

25:51.114 --> 25:53.377
[laughing, chattering]

25:57.947 --> 25:58.992
Shit.

26:10.743 --> 26:12.179
Guess this will do.

26:31.111 --> 26:32.503
[chuckles]

26:41.512 --> 26:42.862
Want some?

26:49.999 --> 26:51.000
Fuck it.

Oh, I haven'’t...

27:22.466 --> 27:23.642
[clears throat]

27:23.816 --> 27:25.600
...done that
since high school.

27:35.915 --> 27:36.916
Why'’d you stop?

27:39.483 --> 27:43.183
I just wanna let you know
that I was married.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.099
Oh.

27:46.273 --> 27:47.448
Okay.

27:48.667 --> 27:49.842
Was?

27:51.060 --> 27:53.236
She died a couple years ago.

27:53.410 --> 27:56.587
It'’s the only reason
I took the job
your dad offered,

27:56.762 --> 28:00.069
'’cause I didn'’t expect
to make it back.

28:02.724 --> 28:04.291
I'’m sorry to hear that.

28:05.901 --> 28:07.468
But I'’m glad you did.

28:08.556 --> 28:10.950
My sister wouldn'’t be here
if you didn'’t.

28:17.521 --> 28:18.609
We can go back.

28:51.642 --> 28:53.688

29:00.129 --> 29:01.304
What was that?

29:01.478 --> 29:02.958
Shit!

29:03.132 --> 29:05.961
Has it started?Oh, God,
they'’re setting up.

29:06.135 --> 29:07.223

[electronic lock buzzes]

29:15.754 --> 29:17.407
Hey, Juan.
How'’s it looking today?

29:17.581 --> 29:19.627
[speaks Spanish]

29:20.497 --> 29:22.238
Mighty quiet here.

29:22.412 --> 29:24.240
I could use a lot
more days like this.
That'’s for sure.

29:24.414 --> 29:25.415
[Aaron chuckles]

29:26.503 --> 29:28.984
So, is that, uh--
is that for me?

29:29.158 --> 29:33.554
Oh, uh, yeah. Yeah, the, uh,
father of the bride brought
in his own Colombian coffee,

29:33.728 --> 29:34.990
so, I thought
you'’d like a cup.

29:35.164 --> 29:36.383
Thanks.

29:39.342 --> 29:40.430
Ah.

29:40.604 --> 29:42.519
Wow. That'’s good.

29:42.693 --> 29:44.913
Yeah, bud, real--
real Colombian beans,
you know.

29:45.087 --> 29:47.089
Nothing but the best
for this wedding party.

29:54.967 --> 29:58.448
Well, it don'’t look like
I'’m the only one here
that could use a drink.

29:59.536 --> 30:01.147
Mind if I join you?

30:01.321 --> 30:02.539
Be my guest.

30:11.722 --> 30:13.986
You know,
it'’s a hell of a place
you picked here.

30:15.335 --> 30:16.858
Yeah, it is.

30:26.563 --> 30:30.002
You know,
my daughter got married.
I didn'’t even get an invite.

30:32.221 --> 30:33.222
Wow.

30:35.877 --> 30:37.096
Honestly...

30:39.228 --> 30:42.057
if it weren'’t for you guys,
I bet this wedding wouldn'’t
have happened either.

30:42.231 --> 30:43.929
And I appreciate that.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.933
I mean, I really do.[Anders exhales]

30:49.935 --> 30:51.240

30:58.465 --> 30:59.988
You know, he might be.

31:02.556 --> 31:04.688
But that sure don'’t
make this day easier.

31:09.606 --> 31:11.173

31:11.347 --> 31:12.609
But that might.

31:21.880 --> 31:22.881
Okay.

[groaning, grunting]

36:30.405 --> 36:33.495
Besides,
I did you a favor.

36:33.669 --> 36:35.845
You don'’t want anyone thinking
you'’re in on this, right?

36:39.327 --> 36:42.156
Perhaps I should have waited
until you got us
into the safe room.

36:44.463 --> 36:45.986
Some people annoy me.

May I have the rings?

37:18.323 --> 37:19.541
The ring.

37:24.198 --> 37:26.113
The ring.[whispers] Yeah, uh...

37:27.680 --> 37:28.898
Well, where are they?

Uh, they'’re safe.
I got '’em.

37:30.813 --> 37:32.511
Are you kidding me?No.

37:36.428 --> 37:38.473
Just one sec.Shit, shit, shit.

37:38.647 --> 37:39.648

They'’ll be right back.

38:01.409 --> 38:05.195
How'’d a squirrelish fucker
like you get in charge
of a place like this?

38:05.370 --> 38:08.721
Believe it or not,
I'’m-- I'’m actually
really good at my job.

38:11.245 --> 38:13.769
I think there'’s a kitchen staff
that might beg to differ.

38:13.943 --> 38:16.816
You-- You said nothing
about killing the staff.

38:18.992 --> 38:20.776
So I need to give you
my plans?

What the hell are you doing?
He-- He was knocked out cold!

38:43.190 --> 38:45.366
Now he'’ll stay that way.
It'’s one less thing
to worry about.

38:45.540 --> 38:47.107
Guys, clear him out.

38:50.502 --> 38:52.939
You-- You do realize
that as soon as you
get the power,

38:53.113 --> 38:55.724

38:55.898 --> 38:57.465
Yes, Aaron,
I do know that.

38:58.901 --> 39:01.208

01:02:49.156 --> 01:02:51.680
Hailey, please,
quiet, okay?

01:02:51.855 --> 01:02:53.813
They'’re gonna--Who was that?

01:02:55.859 --> 01:02:57.425
It was Axel.

01:02:57.599 --> 01:03:00.428
I thought you said
he was dead.

01:03:00.602 --> 01:03:02.387
I thought he was.

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:06.130
If he kills my dad,
it'’s on you.

01:03:08.132 --> 01:03:10.525
I just gotta-- Hey.Get the fuck off me!
Get off me!

01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:14.138
Can you keep it down.
They'’re gonna find us.Fuck.

01:03:17.358 --> 01:03:19.056
[sobbing]

01:03:23.016 --> 01:03:24.017
Hey.

01:03:46.735 --> 01:03:48.825
My-My-My dad has a phone.

01:03:50.957 --> 01:03:52.872
He has a satellite phone.

01:03:54.265 --> 01:03:56.658
What do you mean, he'’s...His room.

01:04:04.971 --> 01:04:06.277
Come on.

01:04:10.585 --> 01:04:11.804
Hi, Chuck.

01:04:12.674 --> 01:04:14.198
You know who I am?

01:04:14.372 --> 01:04:15.939
[breathing heavily]

01:04:16.113 --> 01:04:18.245
We'’ve never had the pleasure
of meeting in person,

01:04:18.419 --> 01:04:20.465
but we have spoken
on the phone a few times.

01:04:24.425 --> 01:04:26.514
I talk to a lot
of fuckin'’ people.

01:04:30.083 --> 01:04:32.651
Does the name Axel Bates
ring a bell?

01:04:39.092 --> 01:04:41.268
You'’re a dead man.

01:04:41.442 --> 01:04:42.487
Well,

01:04:43.662 --> 01:04:46.665
death certainly
would have been merciful.

01:04:46.839 --> 01:04:49.450
But instead, I was picked up
by those friendly folk

01:04:49.624 --> 01:04:51.539
who kidnapped your daughter.

01:04:53.106 --> 01:04:54.629
Tortured me
for a couple of months.

01:04:54.803 --> 01:04:57.197
Unfortunately for them,

01:04:57.371 --> 01:04:59.504
they just got a little
too comfortable with me.

01:05:00.418 --> 01:05:01.985
So they'’re gone.

01:05:03.856 --> 01:05:07.251
And here I am with a fresh,
new perspective on life.

01:05:09.818 --> 01:05:13.518
Let me tell you something,
you son of a bitch.

01:05:13.692 --> 01:05:16.042
All I wanted was
to get my daughter back.

01:05:17.043 --> 01:05:18.262
What about Zeke?

01:05:19.176 --> 01:05:20.264
He was someone'’s kid.

01:05:21.091 --> 01:05:22.614
And he has a daughter.

01:05:23.658 --> 01:05:25.486
Zoey is five years old
right now.

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:28.794
And guess what, Chuck?
Her daddy ain'’t
ever comin'’ home.

01:05:30.752 --> 01:05:32.319
So let me ask you:

01:05:33.625 --> 01:05:36.236
Is Brooke'’s life
more valuable than Zeke?

01:05:40.632 --> 01:05:42.112
No!

01:05:44.157 --> 01:05:45.071
Goddamn right.

01:05:45.245 --> 01:05:47.291
[gunshot]No!

01:05:47.465 --> 01:05:50.337
[groaning]

01:05:50.511 --> 01:05:51.556
No, you didn'’t...

01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:53.819
No. No!

01:05:53.993 --> 01:05:56.691
[continues groaning]

01:06:07.528 --> 01:06:09.226
[gunfire]

01:06:12.446 --> 01:06:13.491
[neck cracks]

01:06:17.321 --> 01:06:21.890
It'’s okay. Come on.[breathing heavily]

01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:35.295
Put some pressure on it.[groans]

01:06:39.212 --> 01:06:41.345
That was the first place
I was shot.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.349
That'’s the second.

01:06:45.523 --> 01:06:48.178
And it left me
with a hell of a headache.

01:06:48.352 --> 01:06:51.137
You wanna see
what it feels like?No, no, no, no. No.

01:06:52.834 --> 01:06:54.401
I'’ll do whatever.

01:06:54.575 --> 01:06:55.620
Good.

01:06:57.839 --> 01:07:01.191
Because you offered us
five million dollars
to bring your daughter home.

01:07:01.365 --> 01:07:02.670
I want my share.

01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:05.064
Is that what you want?

01:07:05.238 --> 01:07:06.805
You want a million bucks?

01:07:06.979 --> 01:07:09.199
I'’ll make it happen.No.

01:07:10.417 --> 01:07:11.810
No, no.

01:07:13.246 --> 01:07:15.596
What are both
your daughters'’ lives
worth to you?

01:07:16.336 --> 01:07:18.556
Two times? Three?

01:07:21.254 --> 01:07:22.951
I don'’t have
that kind of money.

01:07:23.126 --> 01:07:24.170
Fine.

01:07:24.344 --> 01:07:25.345
[gunshot][shouts]

01:07:25.519 --> 01:07:27.739
No! Oh, no!

01:07:28.435 --> 01:07:30.785
Oh, shit.

01:07:30.959 --> 01:07:32.483
You want
five million dollars?

01:07:32.657 --> 01:07:34.006
I'’ll give you
five million dollars.

01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:36.487
That'’s not enough
for what I went through.

01:07:37.662 --> 01:07:39.229
7.5.

01:07:39.403 --> 01:07:43.189
But I promise you,
that'’s all I can get out.

01:07:46.714 --> 01:07:47.672
Okay.

01:07:47.846 --> 01:07:49.413
I can live with that.

01:07:51.502 --> 01:07:54.157
I don'’t begrudge you
for what you did, Chuck.

01:07:54.331 --> 01:07:57.464
Any father with your means
would have done
the exact same thing.

01:07:59.162 --> 01:08:02.730
But Cal, Bradley, Anders,

01:08:04.297 --> 01:08:06.082
they made their choice.

01:08:06.256 --> 01:08:08.127
And now it'’s time
for their reckoning.

01:08:10.042 --> 01:08:12.958
Listen. Now, I don'’t care.

01:08:15.874 --> 01:08:17.615
Just don'’t
hurt my daughters.

01:08:20.792 --> 01:08:23.099
You do what you say
you'’re gonna do,

01:08:23.273 --> 01:08:25.623
you have my word.

01:08:25.797 --> 01:08:29.409
You fuck with me,
I'’m gonna kill everyone
in here.

01:08:29.583 --> 01:08:32.499
And then I'’m gonna
make you watch while I
kill your daughters.

01:08:32.673 --> 01:08:34.066
Got it?

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:35.459
Got it.

01:08:37.330 --> 01:08:38.418
I got it.

01:08:38.592 --> 01:08:39.550
[Marshall on speakers]
Hey, gang.

01:08:39.724 --> 01:08:41.552
Pay close attention now.

01:08:41.726 --> 01:08:45.686
We have, uh, five
wedding members currently
roaming the hallways.

01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:47.645
Ooh, get this.
In the kitchen,

01:08:47.819 --> 01:08:51.127
yeah, we have the lovely
bride-to-be, Brooke.

01:08:51.301 --> 01:08:55.957
I think
that she is with a blast
from the past, Anders.

01:08:56.132 --> 01:08:58.177
Asshole.

01:08:58.351 --> 01:08:59.961
And that'’s not all, gang.

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:04.705
And we have the bride'’s sister,
Hailey, maid of honor.

01:09:04.879 --> 01:09:06.403
Yep. On the third-floor suite.

01:09:06.577 --> 01:09:09.580
And she'’s with the best man,
Bradley.

01:09:09.754 --> 01:09:13.018
But watch out,
Bradley'’s got a gun,
and it does go bang, bang.

01:09:13.192 --> 01:09:14.541
[chuckles] All right.

01:09:14.715 --> 01:09:17.327
And then, gang,
our number one target, Cal,

01:09:17.501 --> 01:09:20.547
the unlucky groom.

01:09:20.721 --> 01:09:23.637
Looks like he'’s heading
to the top-floor suites,
I believe.

01:09:23.811 --> 01:09:26.988
Happy hunting.[laughing]

01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:30.427
We have to go.Wait, wait, wait.

01:09:30.601 --> 01:09:32.907
Someone will come.
But don'’t worry, I have a plan.

01:09:33.081 --> 01:09:34.213
You need to surrender.

01:09:34.387 --> 01:09:36.215
What?Yes.

01:09:36.389 --> 01:09:38.609
Put your hands up,
stay right here and surrender.

01:09:38.783 --> 01:09:40.741
Trust me.
I'’ll handle the rest.

01:09:40.915 --> 01:09:42.743
Okay.I'’m not leaving you.

01:09:51.274 --> 01:09:52.579
[door opens]

01:09:52.753 --> 01:09:54.102
Get on your knees!

01:09:55.321 --> 01:09:56.931
Where'’s Anders?No.

01:10:02.763 --> 01:10:04.287
Let'’s go get me my money.

01:10:05.288 --> 01:10:06.289
Come on.

01:10:07.899 --> 01:10:09.814
[Chuck] Okay. Okay.

01:10:17.256 --> 01:10:18.431
[door beeps]

01:10:21.391 --> 01:10:22.870
Over there.Yeah.

01:11:21.102 --> 01:11:22.974
What'’s this moron doing?
Jesus.

01:11:23.148 --> 01:11:25.890
[sighs][door buzzes]

01:11:29.676 --> 01:11:32.157
Hey, dipshit.
Everyone'’s supposed to go
to the restaurant.

01:11:34.855 --> 01:11:37.510
Ah, but since you have
the lovely bride that-was-to-be,

01:11:37.684 --> 01:11:40.383
what do you say we have
a little fun, huh?
[chuckles]

01:11:42.123 --> 01:11:44.125
Fuck you.[gunshot]

Fuck you!

01:12:25.123 --> 01:12:27.299
It was him or us.
Good choice.

01:12:29.388 --> 01:12:31.477
Okay, give it to me.

01:12:34.306 --> 01:12:36.830
Good.
Everything'’s okay.

[whispers]
One, two, three, four, five.

01:13:03.204 --> 01:13:05.946
They'’re searching the rooms.
Five seconds in each room.

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.035
I'’ll be right back.
Find that phone.

01:13:10.908 --> 01:13:13.345
[typing]

01:13:16.304 --> 01:13:19.046

in the restaurant.

01:13:30.710 --> 01:13:32.059

Do my job.

01:13:34.801 --> 01:13:35.802
Here. Take this.

01:13:36.542 --> 01:13:38.196
Now you know how to use it.

01:13:44.898 --> 01:13:46.726
