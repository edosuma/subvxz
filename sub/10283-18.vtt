00:03.871 --> 00:05.173
Previously on ER:

00:05.173 --> 00:07.541
I'm Dr. Pratt.
Olivia Evans.

00:08.742 --> 00:10.178
I should move out.

00:10.178 --> 00:11.712
Why?

00:11.712 --> 00:13.547
RASGOTRA:
I think we both know why.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.783
The cops brought in
a friend a while ago

00:15.783 --> 00:17.485
for a blood-alcohol level.

00:17.485 --> 00:19.687
I drew my own blood,
switched the tubes.

00:19.687 --> 00:22.390
There's little doubt they'll
suspend your license.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.558
You're going on a vacation.
What?

00:24.558 --> 00:27.195
I was offering you the job.
But you and Alex,

00:27.195 --> 00:29.430
you're more than welcome
to come live with me.

00:29.430 --> 00:30.498
Excuse me?

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:55.356 --> 00:57.525
Mm...

01:01.262 --> 01:02.730
( footsteps descending )

01:14.875 --> 01:16.210
Good morning,
Samantha.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.545
Hi!

01:17.545 --> 01:19.580
Uh... I was just going
to get Alex,

01:19.580 --> 01:22.250
he'll sleep for a week
if I let him.

01:22.250 --> 01:25.253
My boys were
the same way.

01:25.253 --> 01:27.455
Not Kelly though.

01:27.455 --> 01:30.658
I used to tease her
about being part rooster.

01:30.658 --> 01:32.860
Three must have
been a handful.

01:32.860 --> 01:35.529
Yeah, but kids are
great, you know?

01:35.529 --> 01:37.865
Especially when they're young--

01:37.865 --> 01:40.701
they haven't turned
on you yet. Right?

01:40.701 --> 01:43.704
Your wife is beautiful.

01:43.704 --> 01:47.241
No idea what
she was doing with me.

01:47.241 --> 01:50.811
Cancer.

01:50.811 --> 01:56.484
Even towards the end, though,
she was... something else.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.586
I got meetings
in the city all day.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.521
I'll be back by 6:00.

02:00.521 --> 02:03.824
I'm entertaining
guests.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.893
Yeah? You gonna sing for 'em?
( laughs )

02:05.893 --> 02:10.364
No, no, just dinner for
the board of directors

02:10.364 --> 02:12.866
and their snooty wives.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.702
Right, well,
I should check your crit.

02:14.702 --> 02:16.704
Yeah, no, we'll
do it tonight.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.739
I'm feeling fine.
At least
a urine sample.

02:18.739 --> 02:22.376
Ah, listen, my pee right now
is a lovely shade of salmon.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.878
...the chelation's working.
Like water colors
in my toilet.

02:24.878 --> 02:27.315
"An ounce
of prevention..."
Ah, listen, come on.

02:27.315 --> 02:29.383
There is no cure
for MDS.

02:29.383 --> 02:31.219
You can stick me
with your needles

02:31.219 --> 02:32.686
after I'm done
entertaining.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.722
You know, you should
use the car today.

02:34.722 --> 02:37.525
That's okay,
we can take the El.
No, I insist.

02:37.525 --> 02:38.726
How about
Mrs. Harrison

02:38.726 --> 02:40.761
whip you and Alex up
some breakfast, huh?

02:40.761 --> 02:43.331
It's the most important
meal of the day. Hmm?

02:44.698 --> 02:46.434
ABBY:
Well, they raised Gallant,

02:46.434 --> 02:48.869
and he turned out okay,
they can't be that bad.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.704
No, they're great, it's
just they're strangers.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.740
What're they doing
in town?
Family wedding.

02:52.740 --> 02:55.376
Are you going to go?
I wouldn't know a soul.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.645
Besides, I'm pretty sure
I'm more dirty-little-secret

02:57.645 --> 02:59.247
than daughter-in-law.

02:59.247 --> 03:00.481
Well, look who it is.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.850
Back with commoners,
are we?

03:02.850 --> 03:05.353
Good Lord,
what is that?

03:05.353 --> 03:06.987
What?
That smell.

03:06.987 --> 03:09.390
It's really bad,
it smells like... ass.

03:09.390 --> 03:12.960
You do realize
how close we are
to the ER?

03:12.960 --> 03:14.562
I think it's you,
Morris.

03:14.562 --> 03:15.896
That patient
we just transferred

03:15.896 --> 03:17.765
threw her colostomy bag
at him.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.500
Uh...
I changed
my clothes though!

03:19.500 --> 03:21.269
Well, I would
recommend a shower.

03:28.276 --> 03:30.311
Oh... somebody's got
a sugar daddy.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.345
You jealous?

03:31.345 --> 03:32.880
Hey, guys.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.783
Morris?

03:35.783 --> 03:37.418
Chemo boy pulled
his central line,

03:37.418 --> 03:38.852
he's bleeding
all over curtain four.

03:38.852 --> 03:41.289
All right, chop-chop,
We earn our money down here.

03:41.289 --> 03:43.391
I better go before Stinky
gets mad.

03:43.391 --> 03:44.692
Hey, uh....

03:44.692 --> 03:47.728
I've been trading
e-mails with Carter.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.297
Really?

03:49.297 --> 03:51.499
Did you tell him about us?
No, no.

03:51.499 --> 03:54.435
Uh, he needs help.
In Sudan.

03:54.435 --> 03:58.038
And he asked me
if, uh...

03:58.038 --> 03:59.707
if I would join him.

04:01.609 --> 04:04.312
In Africa?
I'd be back before
the baby's born.

04:04.312 --> 04:07.448
Oh, okay.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.016
Okay. I mean, were you, um...

04:09.016 --> 04:12.320
planning on talking to me
about this?
I am talking to you.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.322
Look, if you don't
want me to go...

04:14.322 --> 04:16.324
You don't need
my permission to go.

04:16.324 --> 04:17.591
The people
need help there.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.059
In his camp alone,

04:19.059 --> 04:21.962
there are over 60,000
IDP's being cared for

04:21.962 --> 04:24.532
by just a handful
of doctors and nurses.

04:24.532 --> 04:27.368
They have problems
with clean water...
Yeah, I know, I know.

04:27.368 --> 04:30.504
I know, believe me, between
you and Carter, I know. I...

04:30.504 --> 04:32.873
( sighs )

04:32.873 --> 04:35.709
If this is something you feel
like you have to do,

04:35.709 --> 04:37.845
then you should do it.

05:34.535 --> 05:35.569
OLIVIA:
Greg?

05:35.569 --> 05:37.070
( knocking )

05:37.070 --> 05:39.072
All right, I'm coming,
I'm coming, damn.

05:41.809 --> 05:43.844
( knocking )

05:43.844 --> 05:46.414
OLIVIA:
Are you there?

05:48.015 --> 05:49.950
Greg?

05:51.151 --> 05:52.986
( knocking )

05:58.626 --> 06:01.595
Hey, baby, what are
you doing here?
Are you all right?

06:01.595 --> 06:02.663
( coughs )

06:02.663 --> 06:03.931
Yeah.
What time is it?

06:03.931 --> 06:06.033
I was worried.
I tried your cell phone.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.868
I left a messages
at the hospital.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.136
Yeah, I'm...
( coughs )

06:09.136 --> 06:11.739
I'm sick, I turned
my phone off.

06:11.739 --> 06:14.842
I-I tried you here, too.

06:14.842 --> 06:17.678
What do you want me to do,
I'm sick, you know?

06:17.678 --> 06:19.947
Don't stress me out
about it.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.516
Can I come in?
I'll make you some tea.

06:22.516 --> 06:25.519
No, no,
I'm cool, uh...

06:28.822 --> 06:31.759
Look, now is not a good time.

06:34.762 --> 06:35.863
But I will be

06:35.863 --> 06:37.197
at work later.
You-you... Okay.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.467
We can talk then, okay?
Olivia?

06:42.536 --> 06:44.972
That's it
right there. S600.
Yup.

06:44.972 --> 06:47.541
Sure is.
JERRY:
That's a
$100,000 car.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.109
It's probably more
with the chauffeur.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.878
Chauffeur?
Get outta here.

06:50.878 --> 06:52.179
You people are
aware that

06:52.179 --> 06:54.014
the Daimler-Benz company
was a vital cog

06:54.014 --> 06:56.083
in the Nazi war
machine, right?

06:56.083 --> 06:58.519
Hey... so who is he?
Who's who?

06:58.519 --> 07:00.053
Your new whale,
Daddy Warbucks.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.089
Spill it, you little
gold digger.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.991
Go kill another
patient, Morris.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.993
What, 97-year-old
lung cancer guy?

07:05.993 --> 07:07.227
Yeah, all my fault.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.763
Doctor Rasgotra,
phone call.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.198
Hi, this is Dr. Rasgotra.

07:11.198 --> 07:12.966
Oh, hi, you're here.

07:12.966 --> 07:17.004
Yeah, I'll come and get you,
it's easy to get lost.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.239
Got a second?
Not really, Michael's
parents are here.

07:19.239 --> 07:20.808
I haven't
seen you around.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.710
Yeah, I've been crazed.

07:22.710 --> 07:25.145
Listen I wanted to...
Is there something
that you wanted...

07:25.145 --> 07:26.246
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

07:26.246 --> 07:27.681
No, go ahead.
Okay.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.517
Um... I was just
thinking about

07:29.517 --> 07:30.851
this whole roomie
situation thing,

07:30.851 --> 07:33.787
I just wanted to make sure
everything was cool.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.823
Yeah, as far as
I know, yeah.
Okay.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.925
So if we needed
to work on anything...

07:37.925 --> 07:39.693
No, no. You know...

07:39.693 --> 07:41.595
I'm married now.

07:41.595 --> 07:44.231
And I should be past sharing
a bathroom with your mates

07:44.231 --> 07:47.768
and your not-so-occasional
one-night stand... stands.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.703
You're right, I've been
totally inconsiderate

07:49.703 --> 07:52.540
when it comes to
having people over.
It's not just that.

07:52.540 --> 07:55.676
I mean, clothes are
everywhere, and dirty dishes...
It's both of us.

07:55.676 --> 07:58.612
I'm a mess, too.
But you're not
nearly as bad.

07:58.612 --> 08:01.148
I've already started looking
for a new place, Ray.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.651
Oh.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.819
Neela!
Colonel Gallant!

08:05.819 --> 08:07.588
BOTH:
Oh...

08:07.588 --> 08:10.023
COLONEL GALLANT:
What did I tell you
the last time?

08:10.023 --> 08:11.592
Right. Dad.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.260
Mom.
Hello, Neela.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.995
This is
my colleague...

08:14.995 --> 08:16.997
Oh.
He was just here.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.298
17-year-old,
restrained driver.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.133
Auto vs. parked SUV
at high velocity.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.169
He lost it taking
a turn too fast.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.204
why do they think
they can get away?

08:24.204 --> 08:26.840
You were chasing him?
He was in a stolen car.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.876
We found a girl
he must have jacked.

08:28.876 --> 08:31.311
How you doing, Deshawn?
He's altered,
BP 130 over 75,

08:31.311 --> 08:33.080
pulse 110.
What do we have?

08:33.080 --> 08:35.315
Blunt head, good vitals, and a
passenger coming behind.

08:35.315 --> 08:36.917
Go ahead, I'll take this.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.751
Jane Doe, found unresponsive
in the back.

08:38.751 --> 08:40.621
Multiple abrasions
and contusions.
Okay.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.590
( loudly ):
Hello? Can you hear me?

08:42.590 --> 08:45.626
Neela, we might need
a hand here.
I'm, uh, I'm sorry.

08:45.626 --> 08:48.295
I'll have someone show you
to a seating area.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.898
Actually, I wouldn't mind
observing your S.O.P.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.733
Oh, of course.

08:52.733 --> 08:55.803
Oh, no, I'll leave the gore
to old blood and guts there.

08:55.803 --> 08:58.639
Uh, were can I get a coffee?
The cafeteria,
sixth floor.

08:58.639 --> 08:59.673
Thanks.

08:59.673 --> 09:00.974
Sinus tach on the scope.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.710
Pupils four millimeters
and reactive.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.978
Abby this is Colonel Gallant,
Michael's father.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.814
Nice to meet you.
Likewise.

09:06.814 --> 09:09.116
You were a medic in Vietnam,
weren't you?

09:09.116 --> 09:11.184
1st Air Cavalry,
'68 to '72.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.953
Four tours. Wow.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.988
All right, let's see
what we've got here.

09:14.988 --> 09:17.825
There is a systematic approach
to the trauma patient

09:17.825 --> 09:20.761
called ATLS:
Advanced Trauma Life Support.

09:20.761 --> 09:23.030
It ensures resuscitation
and stabilization

09:23.030 --> 09:26.767
in even the most
critical of patients.

09:26.767 --> 09:29.302
( groaning )
Trauma panel, c-spine,
chest and pelvis.

09:29.302 --> 09:30.971
Ah, Chicago's finest.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.006
Dr. Morris, Chief Resident.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.274
TAGGART:
Settle down, Deshawn.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.976
We're trying
to help you, okay?

09:35.976 --> 09:37.811
Guy must be on meth
or something.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.813
Deformity of
the 5th metacarpal.
Boxer's fracture.

09:39.813 --> 09:42.249
He's a real
fighter, huh?
Took a swing at me.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.284
Need me to check
that out?
I'm good.

09:44.284 --> 09:47.120
Okay, liter of N.S.,
throw in a second I.V.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.957
BP's good, 125 over 80.
Pulse ox 99.
Calm down, man.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.391
Head CT and a tox screen.

09:51.391 --> 09:53.360
Tenderness to
the left mandible.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.062
MORRIS:
Add a jaw series.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.097
Airway is patent.
Is the trachea midline?
Yes.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.131
Any JVD?
No.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.967
Muffled heart tones?
No.

09:59.967 --> 10:02.002
Where are we, ladies?
We're assessing
the nine

10:02.002 --> 10:03.704
most immediately life
threatening injuries.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.873
Inadequate airway protection,
airway obstruction,

10:05.873 --> 10:07.741
tension pneumothorax,
flail chest with hypoxia,

10:07.741 --> 10:10.177
I'm sure you're a big hit
at surgical grand rounds.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.245
Doctor Morris, this is
Colonel Gallant.

10:12.245 --> 10:15.082
Michael's father.
Ah, it's a great honor
to meet you, sir.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.918
You in the service, Dr. Morris?
Uh, no.
Flat feet.

10:17.918 --> 10:21.388
Guys, I don't think
she's breathing.
Pulse ox 88.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.991
Ambu-bag, intubation tray,
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.693
Dr. Morris, if you'll
please provide

10:25.693 --> 10:27.928
inline stabilization
of the neck.
Sats are dropping.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.763
RASGOTRA:
Ah, it's hard
to bag her.

10:29.763 --> 10:32.733
Take a look, Neela.

10:34.935 --> 10:38.305
I can't, she's
completely clamped down.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.973
Did you push the sux?
Yeah.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.241
Is that a good IV?

10:41.241 --> 10:42.810
MALIK:
It went
right through.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.979
She's completely spasmed shut.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.415
I can't bag her.
Okay, throw in
two nasal trumpets.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.083
Start a second line,

10:50.083 --> 10:53.854
push another of 150 of sux
from a different vial.

10:53.854 --> 10:56.156
TAGGART:
All right, we're
taking you off this board,

10:56.156 --> 10:58.091
and making you feel
more comfortable, okay?

10:58.091 --> 10:59.927
Lie still,
you son of a bitch!

10:59.927 --> 11:01.962
BARNETT:
Let's get him
on hard restraints.

11:01.962 --> 11:04.798
Give him some morphine?
I don't want him
to stop breathing.

11:04.798 --> 11:07.034
He's got a broken hand
and a broken jaw,

11:07.034 --> 11:09.002
he's in pain.
Okay, I'll splint him.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.905
He won't lay still.
He will if you tape his head.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.473
I don't know
what he's on.

11:13.473 --> 11:16.409
Could have a real
head injury.
Yeah. Hence the CT.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.846
If it's normal, then
he can spend the time

11:18.846 --> 11:21.915
in a jail cell
and sober up.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.184
Okay, two of Versed.

11:25.418 --> 11:27.788
( groaning )

11:27.788 --> 11:30.023
Thought you said
his airbag deployed.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.458
Yeah.

11:31.458 --> 11:34.962
Kind of hard to break your jaw
on an airbag.

11:34.962 --> 11:37.464
LOCKHART:
150 of sux going in
the second IV.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.932
MALIK:
Got your flush.

11:38.932 --> 11:41.368
She should be relaxing.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.203
Damn, it's worse, her
masseter's in spasm.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.438
It's like a bloody vice.
Okay, how about Valium?

11:45.438 --> 11:47.240
It's too late.
Abby, bag her.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.109
RASGOTRA:
I'll prep the neck.
Crike tray.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.144
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Maybe it's the sux.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.946
What?
Pavulon.

11:52.946 --> 11:54.314
Six of Pavulon,
right now!

11:54.314 --> 11:56.149
Abby, if the sux
isn't working, it's...

11:56.149 --> 11:59.820
When I was a nurse, we had
a patient in the OR for TOA,

11:59.820 --> 12:02.022
who had the exact
same response to sux--

12:02.022 --> 12:04.257
her jaws were clamped shut.
Betadine and a steri-drape.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.794
Give the Pavulon
a chance to work.
Eleven blade.

12:06.794 --> 12:08.896
Neela, do not cut!

12:08.896 --> 12:10.263
Sats are down
to 82.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.965
MORRIS:
Okay, we should
get Kovac.

12:11.965 --> 12:14.234
Abby, if we wait she'll
have anoxic brain injury.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.369
Jaw is slack. Suction.

12:16.369 --> 12:19.306
Let's go!
Abby Lockhart
with the save.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.179
We were about to crike her
when the Pavulon kicked in.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.881
Masseter spasm after sux.

12:27.881 --> 12:30.517
There was a case report
in J.E.M. last fall.

12:30.517 --> 12:31.885
Good catch.
Thank you.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.486
Head CT on your
carjack girl.

12:33.486 --> 12:35.122
Hey, Morris,
films on your carjacking.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.456
Thank you, my man.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.091
No bleed, no fracture,
completely normal.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.159
Why'd she stop
breathing?

12:39.159 --> 12:40.293
Hard to say.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.895
Could be drugs, alcohol.

12:41.895 --> 12:44.197
We need to get her
into an ICU bed

12:44.197 --> 12:45.532
and monitor for
hyperthermia.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.200
Police I.D.'d her yet?

12:47.200 --> 12:49.369
No, they're still
working on it.

12:49.369 --> 12:50.570
Hello.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.272
Hey.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.573
Can you open your eyes?

12:53.573 --> 12:55.442
Still paralyzed
from the Pavulon.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.145
Give her an hour.
All right. Can you call RT?

12:58.145 --> 13:00.547
Tell them to lower
the F.I. O2 to 50.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.256
Have you made a decision yet?

13:09.256 --> 13:10.858
About what?

13:13.861 --> 13:16.296
Look, if you really
don't want me to go...

13:16.296 --> 13:18.165
No, I know.
You said that already.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.600
I don't understand why
you're putting this all on me.

13:20.600 --> 13:25.038
I already told you, it's gonna
be only for a few weeks.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.506
Luka, the last
time you went,

13:26.506 --> 13:28.041
we thought you died.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.977
But instead,
you came back with malaria.

13:29.977 --> 13:32.145
Dr. Kovac, paramedics
are bringing in chest pain

13:32.145 --> 13:35.582
with ST elevation.
Okay, page cards
and put the cath lab on hold.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.584
I'll be right there.
Okay.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.389
Can we talk about this later?
Yeah, sure.

13:50.097 --> 13:53.033
Fifth metacarpal fracture,
30 degrees of angulation.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.935
Non-displaced
mandible fracture.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.236
No need for surgery.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.906
( groaning )

13:58.906 --> 14:00.607
BARNETT:
Hey, easy, man.

14:00.607 --> 14:01.975
You broke your jaw.

14:01.975 --> 14:03.176
( groaning )

14:05.478 --> 14:07.915
Tox screen was negative,
blood alcohol, zero.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.549
Guess he was combative
from his concussion.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.052
Stop eyeballing me, jag off.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.021
( grunts )

14:14.021 --> 14:16.056
What?

14:16.056 --> 14:17.090
You worried about her?

14:17.090 --> 14:18.525
HOLLIS:
You better be.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.061
She dies, we got your
ass on felony murder.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.562
That's 25 to life

14:22.562 --> 14:26.099
you get to spend
with your homeys.

14:27.968 --> 14:31.038
You've got a hell
of a unit in there.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.339
Good people.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.041
Especially that Lockhart.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.176
Worked her way
up from a nurse?

14:36.176 --> 14:39.446
You could learn a lot
working under her command.
Actually, Abby and I...

14:39.446 --> 14:41.949
Yeah, she's excellent.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.050
You're lucky.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.085
Good leadership,
half the battle.

14:45.085 --> 14:48.155
So I was thinking, if we hurry,
we can do Michigan Avenue

14:48.155 --> 14:50.390
and still have time
for Field's down on State.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.992
You can't go two days

14:51.992 --> 14:53.626
without swiping that
credit card, can you?

14:53.626 --> 14:56.696
You know, we need to get you
something nice for the house.

14:56.696 --> 14:58.231
Sheets.
Michael loves soft sheets.

14:58.231 --> 15:01.068
When he was a little boy,
we had to drag him

15:01.068 --> 15:02.702
out of our bed.
That's not necessary.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.537
I'm... we're looking
for a new place

15:04.537 --> 15:06.573
and we got everything needed
after the wedding.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.108
Oh, don't be silly.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.077
We'll find you something
at Field's.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.012
I can always find something
at Field's.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.713
It'll be fun.
For who?

15:13.713 --> 15:16.116
You don't have
to go with, James.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.551
Neela and I can get along
just fine without you.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.187
Maybe she
doesn't want to shop.

15:20.187 --> 15:21.554
You ever think
of that?

15:21.554 --> 15:23.590
Our son deserves
something nice for the house.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.726
The boy isn't in the house, Glo.
And why is that, James?

15:26.726 --> 15:30.097
Why don't you explain why
he's not here with his wife.

15:32.132 --> 15:33.133
Come on.

15:36.036 --> 15:38.271
Jim Coker, 82, assault victim.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.373
HARMS:
Multiple contusions
to the arms and torso.

15:40.373 --> 15:43.276
A and 0, B.P. 165/100.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.511
TAGGART:
Nasty bruises.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.146
What'd you get
hit with, sir?

15:46.146 --> 15:49.482
Felt like a brick.
They get the attacker?

15:49.482 --> 15:52.152
Meet Fredna Nasse, 80.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.221
Lacerations to the right palm.

15:54.221 --> 15:55.422
TAGGART:
You attacked him?

15:55.422 --> 15:57.057
Damn right.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.591
Cheating bastard!

15:58.591 --> 16:01.561
What did you hit
him with, ma'am?
An urn.

16:01.561 --> 16:05.065
I would have hit him again,
but the damn thing broke

16:05.065 --> 16:08.701
and cut my hand
and spilled Wally's ashes

16:08.701 --> 16:10.637
all over everything.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.771
Who's Wally?

16:11.771 --> 16:14.374
My husband, God rest his soul.

16:14.374 --> 16:15.775
Can you wiggle
your fingers?

16:15.775 --> 16:18.278
Order a hand series.
Where does it hurt, sir?

16:18.278 --> 16:21.048
All over--
mostly my chest.

16:21.048 --> 16:22.515
What's this scar?

16:22.515 --> 16:25.785
They put a pig valve in
my heart 10 years ago.

16:25.785 --> 16:29.556
You got a pig head, too,
philanderer!

16:32.192 --> 16:36.229
Come on, open your eyes.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.332
Yankauer.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.668
B.P.'s sky
high-- 190/122.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.170
Okay, amp of atropine.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.204
Morris!

16:44.204 --> 16:45.772
195/120.
Mix up nipride.

16:45.772 --> 16:49.076
Hey, have you seen Neela?
I gave her a few hours off.

16:49.076 --> 16:51.678
She's out with the Gallants.
What's up?
Hypertension and bradycardia.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.081
MORRIS:
Cushing reflex--

16:54.081 --> 16:55.515
increased pressure
in the brain.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.518
No, the CT was clear.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.220
Right pupil's slightly bigger.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.089
BARNETT:
Check her fundi.
Yeah.

17:02.089 --> 17:04.557
Disc margins are blurry.
Elevated ICP.

17:04.557 --> 17:08.228
Is it a brain bleed?
No, I just told you
the CT was clear.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.463
I doubt she bled
in the last five minutes.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.499
Okay, I'll call neurosurg
for an ICP monitor.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.534
Where's Luka?
I think he's in exam three.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.603
Okay, 50 of mannitol,
dial up the nipride.

17:16.603 --> 17:17.837
And I'll be right back.

17:17.837 --> 17:20.373
Chest is clear,
heart looks good.

17:20.373 --> 17:24.243
He doesn't have a heart.
For God's sake, Fredna,
give it a rest, will you?

17:24.243 --> 17:26.313
I'm not the one
who needs a rest.

17:26.313 --> 17:30.450
I'm gone two days, and you
can't keep it in your pants?

17:30.450 --> 17:33.120
I crack a rib or
something, doc?

17:33.120 --> 17:35.388
Pain's getting worse.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.257
Awful hard to breathe.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.491
KOVAC:
Both lungs are up.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.127
B.P's dropping--
90/50.

17:40.127 --> 17:42.295
Repeat EKG and chest,
Whoa!

17:42.295 --> 17:43.396
500 cc saline bolus.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.365
Not gonna die, is he?

17:45.365 --> 17:46.799
No, no, I don't think so.

17:46.799 --> 17:49.136
Well, if he is, let him.

17:49.136 --> 17:50.737
You sure you two
aren't married?

17:50.737 --> 17:53.373
Luka, can you take another
look at our carjacking girl?

17:53.373 --> 17:55.575
Not right now. I'm sorry.
Systolic's only 80.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.610
She's got elevated ICP
and a normal scan.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.379
Let's put him
in Trendelenberg.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.814
Should I repeat the CT?
Anything pertinent
in the history?

18:01.814 --> 18:03.283
I didn't get a history.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.717
She's intubated and paralyzed.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.787
Okay, try to talk to the guy
they brought her in with.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.222
The carjacker?
Yeah.

18:09.222 --> 18:12.159
ICP rises with cocaine
and amphetamine.

18:12.159 --> 18:14.627
She may need phentolamine
or a beta blocker.

18:14.627 --> 18:15.895
TAGGART:
Repeat EKG.

18:15.895 --> 18:18.165
Sat's only 82.
Try to get a history.

18:18.165 --> 18:21.201
I'll be in as soon as I can.
Set up for bipap,

18:21.201 --> 18:23.870
get an ultrasound and let's see
if there's any free resident.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.805
He's really not okay,
is he, doc?

18:25.805 --> 18:27.474
What's his name?

18:27.474 --> 18:28.508
HOLLIS:
Deshawn Liberty.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.210
Deshawn, the girl in the car,

18:30.210 --> 18:32.312
does she have
any medical conditions?

18:32.312 --> 18:35.182
He's not
the helpful type, doc.
Did she take any drugs?

18:35.182 --> 18:36.816
Coke, meth, anything?

18:36.816 --> 18:39.452
What are you doing?
I'm trying to get
a history,

18:39.452 --> 18:41.321
He can't talk
with a broken jaw.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.190
Well, okay, fine,
then he can write.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.192
Not with a busted hand.

18:45.192 --> 18:47.194
Well, he could use
his good hand.

18:47.194 --> 18:50.363
Can you take these off?
I don't think so.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.265
Fine, I'll take off
the hard restraint.

18:52.265 --> 18:55.668
MORRIS:
Abby, Abby, are you crazy?
He's dangerous.

18:55.668 --> 18:56.903
( Lockhart's dialogue muffled )

18:56.903 --> 19:00.940
Deshawn, did she
take any drugs?

19:00.940 --> 19:04.644
( muffled dialogue )

19:04.644 --> 19:06.279
Kid know something?
HOLLIS:
Like what?

19:06.279 --> 19:08.315
Take the cuffs off.
That girl could die.

19:08.315 --> 19:09.782
HOLLIS:
He hit a police officer!

19:09.782 --> 19:12.419
MORRIS:
Let them do their jobs,
we'll do ours.

19:12.419 --> 19:16.289
( muffled dialogue )

19:16.289 --> 19:17.890
LOCKHART:
That girl needs help.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.264
Hey, what are you doing?
He's deaf, okay?

19:26.566 --> 19:28.901
Do you read lips?

19:29.736 --> 19:30.970
Good.

19:30.970 --> 19:34.241
The girl in the car,

19:34.241 --> 19:39.512
did she take drugs?

19:39.512 --> 19:42.815
BARNETT:
Damn it, I don't know
what that is.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.251
All right.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.493
X?

19:53.493 --> 19:54.527
Ecstasy?

19:54.527 --> 20:00.467
Did she take ecstasy?

20:00.467 --> 20:02.869
G... GHB.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.705
All right, that girl's been
frying her brain for 20 minutes.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.844
Brooke Sawyer.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.514
We didn't know.

20:14.514 --> 20:17.850
Maybe if you guys weren't
so busy beating on him...

20:21.754 --> 20:22.889
LOCKHART:
That's 8 of Ativan.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.391
MALIK:
Systolic's up to 220.

20:24.391 --> 20:25.925
Head CT is ready.
She might not need that.

20:25.925 --> 20:28.428
Her brain's seizing, but the
Pavulon has her body paralyzed.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.863
Sub-clinical seizure.
Yeah, the Ativan
should take care of that.

20:30.863 --> 20:33.600
That doesn't work,
she's gonna need a CT.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.368
Keep going, 50 migs a minute.

20:35.368 --> 20:36.903
I'm calling neurosurgery.

20:36.903 --> 20:39.539
Just give it five minutes.
It's not a bleed.

20:39.539 --> 20:43.276
If it is, we don't
have five minutes.
It's not a bleed.

20:43.276 --> 20:45.912
Pressure's coming down--
130/85.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.280
Pulse normalizing-- 84.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.716
Hang up, Morris.
Wrong number.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.751
BARNETT:
Nice call.
What do you think happened?

20:51.751 --> 20:53.420
I don't know.

20:53.420 --> 20:56.055
your broken arm kid's mom
is packing.

20:56.055 --> 20:58.491
Okay, you guys good here?
Yeah, we got it.

20:58.491 --> 21:00.927
Jerry, can you ask Frank
where our sign interpreter is.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.762
Right here.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.597
What? I'm trilingual.

21:04.597 --> 21:05.965
I hate this thing!

21:05.965 --> 21:08.801
Well, it's only for
six weeks, buddy.

21:08.801 --> 21:10.937
Six weeks?! That's forever!

21:10.937 --> 21:13.573
Dickie, quiet down.
Can I just check
your cast here?

21:13.573 --> 21:16.976
No! I hate you!
Stop it! Now!

21:16.976 --> 21:19.446
You suck.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.414
Right. Any pain in
your fingers, buddy?

21:21.414 --> 21:22.549
No.

21:22.549 --> 21:23.683
Can you feel this?

21:23.683 --> 21:25.485
Yeah. Can you feel this?

21:25.485 --> 21:27.387
Ow!

21:27.387 --> 21:30.557
Dr. Morris, Jordan Prior,
Ladokern Pharmaceuticals.

21:30.557 --> 21:34.494
If I could just steal
a moment of your time.

21:34.494 --> 21:36.729
Systolic's down to 75.

21:36.729 --> 21:39.899
Heard you needed a hand.
Blood in the belly?
No, it's clear.

21:39.899 --> 21:40.967
In the heart?

21:40.967 --> 21:42.802
TAGGART:
No cardiac effusion.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.837
PRATT:
All right, let's
try with a Doppler.

21:44.837 --> 21:47.006
Please, I didn't mean
to hurt him, not...

21:47.006 --> 21:48.375
not like this.

21:48.375 --> 21:49.376
You did this?

21:49.376 --> 21:51.444
Yes.

21:51.444 --> 21:53.112
KOVAC:
Mitral regurgitation
through his porcine valve.

21:53.112 --> 21:54.947
Yeah, looks like he blew it out.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.883
He was hypertensive
when he came in.

21:56.883 --> 21:59.118
Stress raised his B.P.
and damaged the valve.

21:59.118 --> 22:01.554
All right, page Cardiothoracic
and hold an O.R.

22:01.554 --> 22:03.490
TAGGART:
B.P.'s 60/40.

22:03.490 --> 22:04.757
Dopamine at 10 mikes.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.659
1.25 of Enalopril.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.028
Ma'am, we're gonna fix him
right up, don't worry.

22:09.028 --> 22:11.931
MARKOVIC:
They were at an
after hours party.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.566
And he couldn't
wake her up,

22:13.566 --> 22:15.835
so he threw her
in the car

22:15.835 --> 22:17.470
and brought her here.

22:17.470 --> 22:18.871
That car was stolen.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.810
MARKOVIC:
No, that car was
her parents'.

22:23.810 --> 22:26.446
And she snuck out.

22:26.446 --> 22:30.517
Why didn't he stop
for the police?

22:33.420 --> 22:36.656
He knew that Brooke needed help,
and he needed to get her here.

22:36.656 --> 22:39.492
And he figured he'd just explain
everything when they got here.

22:39.492 --> 22:41.428
Then why did he
fight with them?

22:44.764 --> 22:46.098
He was
fighting back,

22:46.098 --> 22:48.034
trying to
protect myself.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.903
Cops don't sign.

22:50.903 --> 22:54.974
And Brooke-- she's
gotten drunk before,
but never like that.

22:54.974 --> 22:57.043
He doesn't
even drink.

22:57.043 --> 23:00.513
He's an athlete.

23:00.513 --> 23:02.749
He wants to know if
she's gonna be okay.

23:02.749 --> 23:04.717
We hope so.

23:04.717 --> 23:10.122
You probably
saved her life.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.625
Thank you.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.160
Thank you.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.595
MRS. GALLANT:
So, you're sticking

23:15.595 --> 23:17.129
with surgery then?

23:17.129 --> 23:19.165
I'm not sure yet.
It's a big decision.

23:19.165 --> 23:21.100
Mm.
Well, sounds like
a good idea.

23:21.100 --> 23:22.935
You'll be able to
find work anywhere.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.971
I was hoping to stay
at County, actually.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.639
You like working there.

23:26.639 --> 23:29.075
I never thought I'd say it, but,
yes, I do.

23:29.075 --> 23:31.177
I've grown quite fond
of Chicago, as well.

23:31.177 --> 23:33.045
Well, don't get your heart set.

23:33.045 --> 23:36.148
I've got a residency set up
for Mike when he gets back.

23:36.148 --> 23:38.117
Muskogee V.A., Oklahoma.

23:40.052 --> 23:42.489
Perhaps Michael will decide
to settle here.

23:42.489 --> 23:43.956
Don't worry.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.124
First time's the hardest.

23:45.124 --> 23:46.559
You'll get used to it.

23:46.559 --> 23:47.694
To what?

23:47.694 --> 23:49.496
Relocating.

23:49.496 --> 23:51.698
Soldier's got to go
where they tell him to.

23:51.698 --> 23:54.901
The upside is,
you get to see the world.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.503
Bismarck, North Dakota,

23:56.503 --> 23:58.805
Barstow, California, Christmas

23:58.805 --> 24:00.640
in Anchorage,

24:00.640 --> 24:02.842
and my all-time favorite,
Indian Springs, Nevada.

24:02.842 --> 24:03.910
Gorgeous in July.

24:03.910 --> 24:05.244
I guess you don't remember

24:05.244 --> 24:07.514
when Mike learned
to sail on Lake Como.

24:07.514 --> 24:08.815
How Val's face lit up

24:08.815 --> 24:11.083
when she saw her
first ballet in Paris.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.653
You've had a good life, Gloria.

24:14.721 --> 24:16.989
So,

24:16.989 --> 24:20.527
you two talk about kids yet?

24:20.527 --> 24:22.228
Um...

24:22.228 --> 24:25.131
no, not yet.

24:27.900 --> 24:30.770
Abby, your carjacking girl's
waking up.

24:30.770 --> 24:32.004
Did you check the NIF?

24:32.004 --> 24:33.272
Yeah, it's 30.

24:33.272 --> 24:35.575
Tidal volume is 700.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

24:35.575 --> 24:37.009
Don't do that,
don't do that.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.110
Hey, look at me.

24:38.110 --> 24:40.713
I'm Dr. Lockhart, okay?

24:40.713 --> 24:42.549
Wiggle your fingers for me.

24:42.549 --> 24:43.583
All right.

24:43.583 --> 24:45.151
Give me a thumbs up sign

24:45.151 --> 24:47.687
if you want me
to take that tube out.

24:47.687 --> 24:49.689
All right, hold on
just a second.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.858
( wheezing )

24:51.858 --> 24:55.194
All right, deep breath in.

24:56.763 --> 24:59.599
And blow it out.

24:59.599 --> 25:02.068
( coughing )

25:06.172 --> 25:07.840
Oh. Oh, my head hurts.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.275
1,000 of acetaminophen.

25:09.275 --> 25:10.977
MALIK:
You got it.

25:10.977 --> 25:14.681
You remember what happened?

25:14.681 --> 25:18.818
We were at a party.

25:18.818 --> 25:21.187
You got in a car accident.

25:21.187 --> 25:22.689
And you stopped breathing.

25:22.689 --> 25:25.157
We had to put you
on a ventilator.

25:25.157 --> 25:27.660
And the Ecstasy that you took

25:27.660 --> 25:30.062
caused you to have seizure,

25:30.062 --> 25:33.132
and we had to treat you
with anti-convulsants.

25:33.132 --> 25:35.635
( teary ):
Oh my God.

25:36.636 --> 25:39.071
Yeah, you were very lucky.

25:56.989 --> 25:58.057
( sniffling )

26:10.036 --> 26:11.804
( sniffling )

26:11.804 --> 26:15.675
He likes to feel
my heartbeat.

26:16.308 --> 26:19.211
It's funny.

26:19.211 --> 26:21.247
He's the only person
in my whole life

26:21.247 --> 26:23.215
who actually
listens to me.

26:25.785 --> 26:28.354
You would serve on the
advisory board, be responsible

26:28.354 --> 26:30.089
for recruiting doctors
to participate

26:30.089 --> 26:31.958
in important
clinical trials.

26:31.958 --> 26:33.793
And with your residency
ending in July,

26:33.793 --> 26:35.795
this could be a
real opportunity

26:35.795 --> 26:37.229
to advance the
practice of medicine,

26:37.229 --> 26:38.865
as well as
your own career.

26:38.865 --> 26:41.100
Okay, you know what? I-I...
Ow. I don't know.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.836
You know, I'm-I'm really not
that much of a salesman.

26:43.836 --> 26:44.904
Expense account?

26:44.904 --> 26:46.839
A generous one.

26:46.839 --> 26:49.676
And this isn't a sales position
we're offering you, Dr. Morris.

26:49.676 --> 26:52.812
Your official title would be
Director of Physician Relations.

26:52.812 --> 26:55.682
Hmm. It's got
a nice-nice ring to it.

26:55.682 --> 26:56.949
Anything broken?

26:56.949 --> 26:58.250
Thankfully, no.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.386
It's just a sprain.
Please continue. Aah!

27:00.386 --> 27:02.288
Well, there are
meetings and presentations

27:02.288 --> 27:05.892
at major medical centers
across the country.

27:07.359 --> 27:10.396
Um, first-first class
air travel?

27:10.396 --> 27:12.031
Of course.

27:12.031 --> 27:15.702
And quarterly meetings at
some very desirable resorts.

27:15.702 --> 27:17.203
Best of all,
no nights,

27:17.203 --> 27:21.941
no weekends, and no
exposure to bodily fluids.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.144
Salary?

27:25.144 --> 27:28.214
You would start somewhere in the
neighborhood of $300,000 a year.

27:28.214 --> 27:30.950
Plus bonuses.

27:30.950 --> 27:33.019
My kind of neighborhood.

27:33.019 --> 27:35.421
( both quietly laugh )

27:35.421 --> 27:37.724
KOVAC:
You sure you want to wait?

27:37.724 --> 27:39.425
That's a four-hour surgery.

27:39.425 --> 27:42.061
Somebody has to be with him
when he wakes up.

27:42.061 --> 27:44.731
Now, let me give some sound
medical advice, Mr. Coker.

27:44.731 --> 27:46.398
Please do not
make her mad again.

27:46.398 --> 27:48.434
I can't help it.
I'm a ladies man.

27:48.434 --> 27:50.236
Always have been.

27:50.236 --> 27:52.071
( laughs ):
Well, just take
it easy, okay?

27:52.071 --> 27:53.806
Thank you,
Doctors.

27:53.806 --> 27:55.241
Pretty nice save, huh?

27:55.241 --> 27:57.476
Yup, timely diagnosis
of a rare condition. Good work.

27:57.476 --> 27:59.445
Looks like Dr.
Pratt is back.

27:59.445 --> 28:02.281
Yeah, well, that's something
I-I want to talk to you about.

28:02.281 --> 28:03.783
What?

28:03.783 --> 28:05.384
Your status here.

28:05.384 --> 28:07.419
My status? I thought
my suspension was over.

28:07.419 --> 28:11.023
That was time off so you could
think about what you did

28:11.023 --> 28:14.961
and so I could think about
what to do about it.

28:14.961 --> 28:18.865
Look, I was talking
to Dr. Carter recently.

28:18.865 --> 28:20.099
Okay.

28:20.099 --> 28:23.435
He wants me to come
to help him in Sudan.

28:23.435 --> 28:25.905
Oh. You're leaving?

28:25.905 --> 28:29.241
No, but I thought you could use
a change of perspective.

28:29.241 --> 28:31.978
No, I think
my perspective is just fine.

28:31.978 --> 28:34.213
Greg, you're going
to be an attending next year.

28:34.213 --> 28:37.149
That means all the decisions
fall on your head.

28:37.149 --> 28:40.219
A month over there will only
make you a better one.

28:40.219 --> 28:43.089
Get your shots, make sure
your passport is current,

28:43.089 --> 28:44.223
and get your hat.

28:44.223 --> 28:46.058
It can get really hot out there.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.294
Wait a minute, wait.
You're sending me to Africa?

28:48.294 --> 28:50.029
Yeah, I am.

28:50.029 --> 28:52.999
And what if my
answer is no?

28:52.999 --> 28:56.202
It's not a request.

28:56.202 --> 28:57.970
Well...

29:00.873 --> 29:02.274
RASGOTRA:
That's about it.

29:02.274 --> 29:04.811
I'm sorry, it's not
much of a tour.

29:04.811 --> 29:07.146
So, when do you plan
on moving?

29:07.146 --> 29:09.115
Uh, been looking
for a place.

29:09.115 --> 29:11.150
It's just been a bit
of a challenge

29:11.150 --> 29:13.419
with my schedule
and Michael being gone.

29:13.419 --> 29:14.921
Only one
bathroom, huh?

29:14.921 --> 29:18.057
Must get hard
with a roommate.

29:18.057 --> 29:19.926
Oh, we manage.

29:19.926 --> 29:21.961
We work different shifts
most of the time.

29:21.961 --> 29:23.930
Hmm. So he's not really
here much?

29:23.930 --> 29:26.132
Cut it out, James.
They're just roommates.

29:26.132 --> 29:29.836
It's not her. I
don't know the boy.
I need to use the phone.

29:29.836 --> 29:31.838
You can use the phone
in my room.

29:36.909 --> 29:39.278
( sighs )

29:39.278 --> 29:41.848
Neela,

29:41.848 --> 29:44.483
I feel I should apologize
for the way we've been acting.

29:44.483 --> 29:47.854
Oh, no. There's no need.
Couples bicker.

29:47.854 --> 29:51.157
We passed bicker years ago.

29:51.157 --> 29:52.925
Oh, it's nothing, really.

29:52.925 --> 29:55.494
You should hear my parents.

29:55.494 --> 29:58.197
Is there, uh, anything
I can get you?

30:00.900 --> 30:02.902
Gloria and I are separating.

30:05.337 --> 30:08.174
Oh. Does Michael know?

30:08.174 --> 30:09.441
No.

30:09.441 --> 30:10.877
Nobody does.

30:10.877 --> 30:13.379
We decided to come
to the wedding,

30:13.379 --> 30:15.414
put on a good show
for the family

30:15.414 --> 30:17.850
before we
dropped the bomb.

30:17.850 --> 30:18.885
We'd like to

30:18.885 --> 30:21.253
tell Mike ourselves, so,

30:21.253 --> 30:24.356
if you don't mind,
keep it in the vault?

30:24.356 --> 30:26.158
Uh, yes, of course.

30:27.526 --> 30:29.361
36-year-old
with epididymis.

30:29.361 --> 30:31.430
He doesn't need
ultrasound, it's
nottorsion.

30:31.430 --> 30:32.999
Any STD risk?

30:32.999 --> 30:34.233
Of course.
He's male.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.302
Did you give him
levofloxacin?

30:36.302 --> 30:37.636
Already wrote
the scrip.

30:37.636 --> 30:39.338
Okay, fine.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.407
That's all.
Thank you.
Abby, we...

30:41.407 --> 30:43.275
We need to
finish our talk.

30:43.275 --> 30:45.945
No, we don't, actually, 'cause
you know what? I understand.

30:45.945 --> 30:47.579
No, no, you don't.
No, I do.

30:47.579 --> 30:49.648
Listen.
No, you listen.
I-I mean...

30:49.648 --> 30:51.550
Sorry. I just...
I... I'm...

30:51.550 --> 30:53.585
You know, I know
that we're not married,

30:53.585 --> 30:56.322
and, um...
and we don't live together,

30:56.322 --> 30:58.357
( whispers ):
and we haven't really defined
our relationship,

30:58.357 --> 31:01.327
and I know that that's mostly,

31:01.327 --> 31:02.995
probably all,
uh, because of me.

31:02.995 --> 31:05.097
But you looked at me and said

31:05.097 --> 31:08.000
that we were going
to do this together.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.635
And I know that
you'll be back

31:09.635 --> 31:12.404
before the baby's born,
but I just... I just hate

31:12.404 --> 31:15.241
And I hate that I hate
that you want to go.

31:15.241 --> 31:18.344
But I'm just
a little bit scared, Luka.

31:18.344 --> 31:21.647
And, um, I don't want
to do this by myself.

31:21.647 --> 31:24.350
But if I have to,
I-I can, and I will.

31:24.350 --> 31:25.551
I'm sending Pratt.

31:28.087 --> 31:30.389
To help me with the baby?

31:30.389 --> 31:32.424
To Darfur.

31:32.424 --> 31:33.592
He...

31:33.592 --> 31:35.427
He-He... He volunteered.

31:35.427 --> 31:36.562
Long story.

31:40.432 --> 31:41.467
So you're staying?

31:41.467 --> 31:42.601
Mm.

31:45.637 --> 31:48.640
Oh, good. That's good.

31:48.640 --> 31:51.243
Well, I'll see you tonight.

31:51.243 --> 31:52.278
Yeah.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.289
KOVAC:
Hey, man.

32:03.289 --> 32:05.457
Hey.

32:05.457 --> 32:08.394
What's up with the suit?
You getting married?

32:08.394 --> 32:10.262
It's my new
school uniform.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.498
How do you like it?

32:12.498 --> 32:14.533
It's school.

32:14.533 --> 32:16.235
But our new house is sweet.

32:16.235 --> 32:17.436
Oh, you moved?

32:17.436 --> 32:18.604
Yeah, to Kenilworth.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.272
Man, you should see it, Luka.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.608
It's like a museum,
it's so big.

32:22.608 --> 32:26.178
Uh, when, uh...

32:26.178 --> 32:28.047
When did that happen?

32:28.047 --> 32:30.082
Oh, when mom started working
for Mr. Elliot.

32:30.082 --> 32:31.750
It's his house,

32:31.750 --> 32:34.453
but he's got an indoor pool
and a movie theater.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.288
( footsteps approaching )

32:36.288 --> 32:37.389
You ready, kiddo? Hey.

32:37.389 --> 32:39.158
I didn't know you guys moved.

32:39.158 --> 32:42.361
Yeah, uh, my boss needs
chelation therapy every night,

32:42.361 --> 32:44.596
so, room and board
is part of the deal.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.571
See you
later, Luka.

32:52.571 --> 32:55.507
So, uh, do you guys live there
now?

32:55.507 --> 32:56.675
Yeah.
Wow.

32:56.675 --> 32:58.344
That's a big change.

32:58.344 --> 33:01.413
Well, it was either that
or double up on my shifts here,

33:01.413 --> 33:03.649
and even then, wouldn't
pay me as much money.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.784
This part of
the deal, too?

33:05.784 --> 33:08.587
I guess.

33:10.222 --> 33:12.591
We're good, Luka.

33:12.591 --> 33:14.626
Really.

33:14.626 --> 33:16.628
( engine starting )

33:23.269 --> 33:26.505
RASGOTRA ( knocking ):
Mrs. Gallant?

33:26.505 --> 33:28.507
Is everything okay?

33:33.512 --> 33:35.647
( sniffles )

33:37.516 --> 33:41.153
Are you all right?

33:41.153 --> 33:43.222
Can I get you anything?

33:43.222 --> 33:47.093
No, thank you.

33:51.097 --> 33:53.665
He told you, didn't he?

33:53.665 --> 33:55.601
I'm very sorry.

33:55.601 --> 33:59.405
So am I.

34:06.245 --> 34:10.748
You're a very
sweet girl, Neela.

34:10.748 --> 34:13.819
And I see why Michael
fell in love with you.

34:13.819 --> 34:16.855
I can tell you
love him, too.
I do.

34:16.855 --> 34:18.224
Very much.

34:18.224 --> 34:21.560
And that's good.

34:21.560 --> 34:25.364
I just wish that love
was always enough.

34:25.364 --> 34:28.833
God knows I love that
man in the other room.

34:28.833 --> 34:31.503
But here I am.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.472
You know...

34:33.472 --> 34:37.809
Michael always talked about
what great parents you were.

34:37.809 --> 34:39.478
Maybe there's still
a chance to...

34:39.478 --> 34:43.748
Have you any idea why Michael
went back to Iraq?

34:43.748 --> 34:46.585
Not exactly.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.254
I guess he felt like

34:48.254 --> 34:49.487
he was needed there.

34:49.487 --> 34:52.757
He... has a strong sense
of duty.

34:52.757 --> 34:54.760
Ah!

34:54.760 --> 34:57.396
Duty.

34:57.396 --> 34:59.265
For years,

34:59.265 --> 35:01.800
I have sacrificed
and compromised,

35:01.800 --> 35:06.638
moving from one sorry
little town to the next

35:06.638 --> 35:10.542
all because of duty.

35:10.542 --> 35:13.345
That boy is his
father's son.

35:13.345 --> 35:16.815
They're soldiers.

35:16.815 --> 35:21.520
And no matter how much
you love them,

35:21.520 --> 35:23.822
there's always another war.

35:25.891 --> 35:27.826
I'm...

35:27.826 --> 35:30.429
I'm not quite sure
what you're trying to tell me.

35:34.733 --> 35:37.469
What I'm trying to tell you is

35:37.469 --> 35:43.275
that a strong marriage
is about two people.

35:43.275 --> 35:45.244
Now Michael's a good man.

35:45.244 --> 35:47.279
Michael is kind, he is loving,

35:47.279 --> 35:51.450
he is generous,
just like his father.

35:51.450 --> 35:54.220
But if staying here
at County in Chicago

35:54.220 --> 35:57.289
is something you want to do,
then that's what you should do.

35:57.289 --> 35:59.291
Never ever let anybody
or anything

35:59.291 --> 36:03.862
make you ever forget
who you are.

36:15.407 --> 36:16.775
Miss Taggart.

36:16.775 --> 36:20.246
Please, come quickly.

36:28.754 --> 36:30.356
Mr. Elliot,
you're awake.

36:30.356 --> 36:32.391
I couldn't get him
to open his eyes.

36:32.391 --> 36:33.759
I'm fine.

36:33.759 --> 36:35.994
Go make sure they don't
ruin the duck, please.

36:35.994 --> 36:37.429
Mr. Elliot...
Regina, come on.

36:37.429 --> 36:39.565
We got 20 people
waiting here.

36:39.565 --> 36:43.535
Please, go.
Yes, sir.

36:46.738 --> 36:48.974
You might want to think
about canceling your dinner.

36:48.974 --> 36:51.477
This transfusion's suppose
to last three weeks.

36:51.477 --> 36:53.312
Well, not this time--
you need blood.

36:53.312 --> 36:54.546
Yeah, right, take three hours.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.014
I got guests.

36:56.014 --> 36:58.550
Then let's get you on
some oxygen at least.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.018
Out of the question.

37:00.018 --> 37:03.689
How will I be able to sing, huh,
with a tube up my nose?

37:03.689 --> 37:05.324
You know what?
This is serious.

37:05.324 --> 37:06.558
You're obviously anemic
right now.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.894
Really?

37:08.894 --> 37:12.964
Well... I'll be done by 9:00.

37:12.964 --> 37:15.434
You can transfuse me then.

37:15.434 --> 37:18.504
You hired me
to take care of you.

37:18.504 --> 37:20.572
then I don't know
what I'm doing here.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.308
What you're doing here now,
Samantha,

37:22.308 --> 37:24.876
is you're working for me.

37:24.876 --> 37:26.945
Maybe I shouldn't be
working for you.

37:29.515 --> 37:31.583
Maybe not.

37:33.652 --> 37:36.688
The 'rents are signing some
paperwork for your transfer.

37:36.688 --> 37:39.325
I guess they want you at
the highfalutin hospital

37:39.325 --> 37:40.459
in the suburbs.

37:40.459 --> 37:42.060
Yeah, that sounds like them.

37:42.060 --> 37:44.996
And we were finally able to
get ahold of your father.

37:44.996 --> 37:47.499
He should be
here pretty soon.

37:47.499 --> 37:48.834
WOMAN:
We called
Dr. Christiano.

37:48.834 --> 37:51.470
He's going to meet us
at St. Helen's.

37:52.738 --> 37:54.473
So we checked it out.

37:54.473 --> 37:55.741
( Jerry clears throat )

37:55.741 --> 37:57.743
Guess the parents
were out of town,

37:57.743 --> 37:59.578
and came home early,

37:59.578 --> 38:01.613
saw the car gone
and called it in.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.014
They, uh, thought
the daughter

38:03.014 --> 38:05.517
was at a friend's house.

38:05.517 --> 38:07.686
Um... my guys here

38:07.686 --> 38:10.356
have something they want
to say to you.

38:10.356 --> 38:12.090
Uh...
( clears throat )

38:12.090 --> 38:16.762
We just wanted to apologize
for the misunderstanding.

38:16.762 --> 38:19.665
We thought you were
flashing gang signs at us.

38:19.665 --> 38:21.900
Yeah, um...

38:21.900 --> 38:24.636
we had no idea you were, um...

38:24.636 --> 38:29.375
We're... we're
really sorry.

38:30.842 --> 38:35.614
Um, he says that he has
a special sign for you guys.

38:39.618 --> 38:42.020
I think that requires
no translation.

38:42.020 --> 38:44.556
Yeah.

38:44.556 --> 38:48.560
And GYN has a bed but they
can't take the PID for hours.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.996
So, did you get a chance
to meet the Gallants?

38:50.996 --> 38:52.464
No, I must've
missed them.

38:52.464 --> 38:53.732
Yeah. Probably
better that way.

38:53.732 --> 38:54.766
Would've been weird.

38:54.766 --> 38:55.801
Why's that?

38:55.801 --> 38:56.935
Why do you think?

38:56.935 --> 38:58.570
Hey, to tell
you the truth,

38:58.570 --> 39:00.839
I don't know how
you do it, my man.

39:00.839 --> 39:04.776
Every girl I've ever slept with
won't give me the time of day.

39:04.776 --> 39:07.779
Ooh, I bet it was really freaky
being at her wedding.

39:07.779 --> 39:09.848
Dude, what are you
talking about?

39:09.848 --> 39:12.484
You know, you and Neela,

39:12.484 --> 39:16.488
the whole roommate-with-benefits
thing.

39:16.488 --> 39:19.057
You think I slept with Neela?

39:19.057 --> 39:20.626
You didn't?

39:20.626 --> 39:21.793
No.

39:21.793 --> 39:23.462
Huh.

39:23.462 --> 39:24.663
Uh, I just assumed.

39:24.663 --> 39:25.697
Everybody did.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.165
Everybody did?

39:27.165 --> 39:29.768
Pretty much. Hey, but,
you know, don't sweat it.

39:29.768 --> 39:31.470
It's just a rumor.
FRANK:
Pratt.

39:31.470 --> 39:32.971
Kovac left this for you.

39:32.971 --> 39:34.606
What is it?

39:34.606 --> 39:36.642
Looks like you're heading
back to the motherland.

39:36.642 --> 39:39.478
Hey, better be careful, Frank.
I'm having a very bad day.

39:39.478 --> 39:42.147
Maybe you woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.

39:42.147 --> 39:43.982
Hey, look, we should
go talk somewhere.

39:43.982 --> 39:45.551
Oh, really?
About what, Greg?

39:45.551 --> 39:47.686
What do you mean
"what about?" About us.

39:47.686 --> 39:49.721
Olivia, come on.
Who was she?

39:49.721 --> 39:51.590
Nobody.

39:51.590 --> 39:54.025
Look, I'm sorry.
I really am.

39:54.025 --> 39:55.927
Come on.

39:55.927 --> 39:58.564
What? I just
said I'm sorry.
I heard you. I-I...

39:58.564 --> 40:00.999
You know... ( sighs )

40:00.999 --> 40:03.602
Explain to me why you did it.

40:03.602 --> 40:06.705
Look, we never talked
about being monogamous.

40:06.705 --> 40:08.740
We never said anything
about not being monogamous.

40:08.740 --> 40:11.176
All you had to do
was be straight with me.

40:11.176 --> 40:12.811
I never meant
to hurt you.

40:12.811 --> 40:15.547
I...
You what?

40:15.547 --> 40:17.182
You played me, Greg.

40:17.182 --> 40:19.618
You acted like we were in
this committed relationship.

40:19.618 --> 40:21.853
And if you really thought
that it was cool

40:21.853 --> 40:24.690
for you to sleep around, you
wouldn't've had your sorry ass

40:24.690 --> 40:26.825
at the door playing
like you were sick.

40:26.825 --> 40:29.461
Olivia, I like you,
and I never was misleading you.

40:29.461 --> 40:31.563
No, you didn't think, that's...
FRANK:
Pratt.

40:31.563 --> 40:34.065
I got a phone call from
L'Alliance de Medecins.

40:34.065 --> 40:35.701
They got your number
from Kovac.

40:35.701 --> 40:37.736
Yeah, just tell them
to hold on, okay?

40:37.736 --> 40:40.171
Listen, I really
cannot do this right now.
Why not?

40:40.171 --> 40:43.475
Because my boss is making me
go to Africa, that's why.

40:43.475 --> 40:45.010
You just don't stop, do you?

40:45.010 --> 40:46.845
What are you talking...
stop what?
Right.

40:46.845 --> 40:48.079
Olivia.
Wait a minute.

40:48.079 --> 40:51.049
I'm not lying to you.

40:51.049 --> 40:52.918
( sighs )

40:56.254 --> 40:57.689
You know, you're right,
Samantha.

40:57.689 --> 41:00.892
I feel much better
with the oxygen.

41:00.892 --> 41:02.728
Did it affect
your singing voice?

41:02.728 --> 41:05.096
Well, I didn't wear it
for the party.

41:05.096 --> 41:09.535
I just stayed in my chair,
never got up.

41:09.535 --> 41:13.204
Just did much more listening
than talking.

41:13.204 --> 41:17.776
Wow, I was beginning to think
you didn't know how to do that.

41:17.776 --> 41:20.111
( chuckles )

41:20.111 --> 41:25.183
Anyway, if you're ready, I'll...
I'll take my blood now.

41:30.922 --> 41:32.157
Yo, Neela.

41:32.157 --> 41:33.659
I'm in here.

41:33.659 --> 41:35.561
Hey, I brought you
a peace offering.

41:35.561 --> 41:36.862
Extra anchovies.
( zipper closing )

41:36.862 --> 41:39.565
And I promise,
no more dirty dishes, okay?

41:39.565 --> 41:42.934
I, uh, going to go and
stay at Abby's for a while.

41:42.934 --> 41:45.571
She's at Luka's
most of the time so...

41:45.571 --> 41:48.039
So, what, are you moving
out, like, tonight?

41:48.039 --> 41:50.742
I'll get to the post office
when I can,

41:50.742 --> 41:53.311
get my mail forwarded.

41:53.311 --> 41:56.948
You want to at least wait
until you find a new place?

41:56.948 --> 42:00.085
Don't think
that's such a good idea.

42:02.153 --> 42:06.925
Yeah, you're probably right.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.996
Hey, um,

42:10.996 --> 42:14.600
all good things, right?

42:17.168 --> 42:20.071
Sure had a lot of fun though.

42:22.307 --> 42:25.043
Maybe the next guy won't
drink all my tequila, huh?

42:25.043 --> 42:26.945
Uh, you need a hand
with anything?

42:26.945 --> 42:28.714
Uh, no, thanks.

42:28.714 --> 42:30.682
Pizza?
I better get going.

42:30.682 --> 42:32.851
Okay.

42:32.851 --> 42:34.620
( chuckles softly )

42:34.620 --> 42:37.222
You know I've been looking
for this for, like, a month.

42:37.222 --> 42:42.193
I rather liked
sleeping in it.

42:42.193 --> 42:45.864
I'll, uh, I'll get
the rest tomorrow.

42:51.637 --> 42:54.640
RAY:
Neela.

42:54.640 --> 42:56.341
Look, just...

42:56.341 --> 42:58.944
Would you just wait
one second, please?

43:03.849 --> 43:08.386
I wish I didn't...
feel how I feel.

43:08.386 --> 43:10.689
But you...

43:10.689 --> 43:13.091
you're the best friend
I've ever had.

43:17.996 --> 43:19.665
Keep this.

43:23.902 --> 43:26.271
( engine starting )
