WEBVTT

00:01.932 --> 00:03.072
The Jeffersons?

00:03.210 --> 00:05.453
It's over now
once and for all.

00:05.591 --> 00:07.317
If youse don't keep
quiet over there,

00:07.455 --> 00:09.664
I'm gonna call
the cops on youse!

00:12.564 --> 00:15.049
Hear that? Nothing.

00:15.187 --> 00:17.051
Them colored people
are all scared of the cops.

00:22.574 --> 00:24.714
I'm glad they stopped.

00:24.852 --> 00:26.957
I wonder what they was
arguing about?

00:27.096 --> 00:28.856
Oh, who knows?
1:00 in the morning.

00:28.994 --> 00:30.858
Maybe he was
in the mood, she wasn't.

00:34.448 --> 00:36.174
In the mood for what?

00:42.490 --> 00:45.942
Oh, that Archie,
he was really something.

00:46.080 --> 00:48.565
Remember when we used
to live next door to him?

00:48.703 --> 00:50.429
I don't wanna
think about that.

00:50.567 --> 00:53.191
But you gotta admit,
thinking about him

00:53.329 --> 00:56.056
helped us that night
when we were in big trouble.

00:56.194 --> 00:59.059
Yeah, that was a night
to remember all right.

01:04.650 --> 01:07.136
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

01:07.274 --> 01:10.070
To the East Side
Movin' on up

01:10.208 --> 01:14.591
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

01:14.729 --> 01:17.525
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

01:17.663 --> 01:20.563
To the East Side
Movin' on up

01:20.701 --> 01:24.532
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:26.362 --> 01:28.743
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

01:28.881 --> 01:31.505
Beans don't burn
on the grill

01:31.643 --> 01:33.955
Took a whole lot of tryin'

01:34.094 --> 01:36.751
Just to get up that hill

01:36.889 --> 01:39.306
Now we're up
in the big leagues

01:39.444 --> 01:41.860
Gettin' our turn at bat

01:41.998 --> 01:44.414
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

01:44.552 --> 01:46.071
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

01:46.209 --> 01:49.005
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

01:49.143 --> 01:52.008
To the East Side
Movin' on up

01:52.146 --> 01:56.530
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

01:56.668 --> 01:59.464
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

01:59.602 --> 02:02.605
To the East Side
Movin' on up

02:02.743 --> 02:07.057
We finally got
a piece of the pie

02:11.717 --> 02:13.719
FLORENCE:
Got your eyes shut?

02:13.857 --> 02:16.170
Okay, Florence,
they're covered.

02:16.308 --> 02:19.069
FLORENCE: Okay, now,
remember, don't open 'em
till I count to three.

02:19.208 --> 02:21.865
Uh-oh! She's finally
gonna make it past two.

02:23.281 --> 02:24.247
George!

02:25.662 --> 02:27.664
FLORENCE: One, two...

02:27.802 --> 02:29.666
Come on, baby,
you can do it!

02:31.772 --> 02:32.704
FLORENCE: Three!

02:32.842 --> 02:34.050
All right?

02:40.367 --> 02:43.818
Why, Florence,
you look just beautiful.

02:43.956 --> 02:44.888
Doesn't she, George?

02:45.026 --> 02:46.027
Terrific!

02:48.237 --> 02:49.514
You ain't even looking.

02:49.652 --> 02:52.137
If I was looking,
I wouldn't be able
to say "terrific".

02:54.104 --> 02:56.176
Stop teasing Florence.

02:56.314 --> 02:57.936
Don't you know
what tonight is?

02:58.661 --> 02:59.662
Hallowe'en?

03:03.528 --> 03:06.151
Florence is going out
with him tonight.

03:06.289 --> 03:07.842
Oh! Him!

03:07.980 --> 03:09.706
And who, may I ask,
is "him"?

03:09.844 --> 03:13.331
"Him" is just the hottest
dude this side of
Amsterdam Avenue.

03:15.471 --> 03:16.920
He reminds me of you,
Mr. Jefferson.

03:17.058 --> 03:18.025
Oh, he does?

03:18.163 --> 03:20.372
Yeah. I mean,
he's so different.

03:20.510 --> 03:22.581
He's tall,
and you're short.

03:25.515 --> 03:27.137
He's handsome,
and you're...

03:27.276 --> 03:29.001
Okay, I heard
enough about him.

03:30.969 --> 03:32.971
Where is this dreamboat
taking you?

03:33.109 --> 03:34.628
Oh, honey, we
going out bumpin'
tonight.

03:34.766 --> 03:36.043
I could've bumped all night

03:36.181 --> 03:37.182
Oh!

03:37.320 --> 03:38.942
I could've bumped
all night

03:39.080 --> 03:41.669
I haven't been out
dancing in years.

03:41.807 --> 03:44.085
Well, why don't you make
him take you dancing?

03:44.224 --> 03:47.606
We were going out,
but Mr. Jefferson is tired.

03:47.744 --> 03:50.160
Well, that's what you get
when you marry
an older man.

03:51.645 --> 03:52.611
Oh!

03:53.094 --> 03:54.924
Ha!

03:55.062 --> 03:56.926
Mrs. Jefferson,
you think this dress
needs something?

03:57.064 --> 03:59.308
Yeah. A foxy lady
to wear it.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.623
A little jewelry
might be nice.

04:04.761 --> 04:06.453
I think I might
have something.

04:08.593 --> 04:10.629
So, what time you
expecting him to
pick you up?

04:10.767 --> 04:12.562
Oh, he ain't picking
me up. I'm going
to meet him.

04:12.700 --> 04:14.944
I wouldn't let that man
waste an ounce of energy.

04:15.082 --> 04:16.221
He's gonna need
it all later.

04:24.954 --> 04:27.025
Florence, try these.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.686
That's perfect!

04:34.998 --> 04:36.241
Just what it needed.

04:37.138 --> 04:39.865
Oh, Mrs. Jefferson,
they're beautiful!

04:40.003 --> 04:42.627
You're sure it's all right
for me to wear?
Of course.

04:42.765 --> 04:43.869
Thanks for
everything.

04:44.007 --> 04:45.975
Have a wonderful time.

04:46.113 --> 04:49.668
Look, you, them earrings
cost more than
your whole outfit.

04:51.981 --> 04:53.879
So be careful
you don't lose them.

04:54.017 --> 04:56.399
Don't worry, honey,
I ain't gonna lose
nothing tonight.

04:56.537 --> 04:58.194
Including the earrings.

05:02.232 --> 05:05.788
I hope they make her feel
as good as I did
when I got them.

05:05.926 --> 05:07.583
Yeah, you really
liked that anniversary gift.

05:08.549 --> 05:10.033
Birthday gift.

05:10.758 --> 05:12.208
So what's the difference?

05:12.346 --> 05:15.211
The difference is
you forgot our anniversary.

05:15.349 --> 05:19.042
Look, Weezy, I ain't gotta
wait for no anniversary
to buy you things.

05:19.180 --> 05:21.079
And besides,
if you liked them
earrings so much,

05:21.217 --> 05:23.046
how come you let
the maid wear them?

05:24.393 --> 05:26.222
Because she
can't hurt them,

05:26.360 --> 05:28.707
and because she went out
tonight to have some fun,

05:28.845 --> 05:30.502
like we were
supposed to!

05:30.640 --> 05:32.435
Weezy, I told you
I'm beat tonight.

05:32.573 --> 05:33.850
Oh, don't give me that.

05:33.988 --> 05:35.680
You really didn't
want to go to
the ballet with me.

05:35.818 --> 05:36.922
Why don't you
just admit it?

05:37.060 --> 05:38.234
Okay, I admit it!

05:38.372 --> 05:40.167
I didn't wanna go see
a bunch of those dudes

05:40.305 --> 05:41.962
running around
in their drawers
on their tippy toes.

05:49.970 --> 05:51.351
Excuse me.

05:52.179 --> 05:54.940
It's the same
old story, George.

05:55.078 --> 05:57.080
When I wanna do something,
and you don't,

05:57.218 --> 05:59.462
you manage to get
tired awful fast.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.775
Well, why the hell
do you have to
pick the ballet?

06:01.913 --> 06:04.294
Because we've
never been to one!

06:04.433 --> 06:06.883
We ain't never been
to a leper colony either.

06:07.781 --> 06:09.092
That don't mean
we gotta go.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.682
You don't understand,
do you?

06:12.820 --> 06:13.890
Just once

06:14.028 --> 06:15.858
I would like to do
something I wanna do,

06:15.996 --> 06:17.825
and have you go along
without a fight!

06:17.963 --> 06:19.655
Who's fighting?

06:19.793 --> 06:22.623
Well, what do you call this?
Dancing cheek to cheek?

06:23.521 --> 06:24.867
Well, I didn't
start it, you did.

06:25.005 --> 06:27.317
There wouldn't be no fight
if you'd get off my back.

06:29.216 --> 06:31.149
Get off your back?

06:31.908 --> 06:33.910
I'll get off
your back, George!

06:34.048 --> 06:36.430
I'll get off
your back right now!

06:36.810 --> 06:38.018
But...

06:43.782 --> 06:47.165
And I just walked out
and slammed the door hard.

06:47.303 --> 06:49.270
I bet I cracked
the plaster.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.411
Okay, so you
had a quarrel.

06:51.549 --> 06:53.482
But slamming the door
doesn't solve anything.

06:54.068 --> 06:56.001
No, but it felt good.

06:57.589 --> 07:00.074
You should talk it out,
like mature adults.

07:03.699 --> 07:06.011
I know that may be
difficult for George, but...

07:08.013 --> 07:10.291
I don't think
that's so funny.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.155
Oh, I'm so
sorry, Louise.

07:12.984 --> 07:14.537
Tom!

07:14.675 --> 07:16.297
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.610
I just laughed because
talking of your earrings

07:18.748 --> 07:21.682
reminded me of
a pocketbook I gave
Helen one Christmas.

07:21.820 --> 07:23.166
It started
a fight, too.

07:23.304 --> 07:26.480
Oh, but that
can't happen anymore,
can it, Puss?

07:29.034 --> 07:31.899
Not since we've been
going to our marriage
fulfillment group.

07:32.037 --> 07:33.522
That's right, my darling.

07:36.559 --> 07:38.596
What was wrong
with the pocketbook?

07:38.734 --> 07:40.390
Nothing. It was beautiful.

07:40.529 --> 07:42.185
Oh, the pocketbook
was fine.

07:42.323 --> 07:45.913
Except it was covered
with an advertising slogan
for Tom's company.

07:46.051 --> 07:49.330
"Pelham Publishers
Pack Passion
Into Paperbacks."

07:51.229 --> 07:53.921
All the other office wives
loved theirs.

07:54.059 --> 07:56.441
I'm not all the other
office wives.

07:56.579 --> 07:59.030
Well, don't get huffy,
sweetheart.

07:59.168 --> 08:00.963
Remember
it's not the gift,

08:01.101 --> 08:02.620
it's the thought
that counts.

08:02.758 --> 08:05.485
Oh, you're so
right, dear.

08:05.623 --> 08:08.315
And that Christmas
your thought stunk.

08:09.834 --> 08:12.422
Well, if you think
for one moment that I...

08:12.561 --> 08:15.011
Helen, Tom, please.

08:15.149 --> 08:17.911
Louise is right.
If we're not careful,
this could lead to a fight.

08:18.049 --> 08:19.706
Oh, yes. Quick...

08:25.505 --> 08:27.921
Uh, can I
do anything?

08:28.059 --> 08:29.750
Play the bongos?

08:30.958 --> 08:32.581
Oh...

08:32.719 --> 08:36.516
At our encounter group,
they taught us how to
end an argument.

08:36.654 --> 08:38.345
Contact, that's
what does it.

08:38.483 --> 08:41.141
And communication.
Exactly.

08:41.279 --> 08:43.626
Do you wanna make up
with George?
Of course.

08:43.764 --> 08:45.801
Then go to the phone
this minute and call him.

08:46.802 --> 08:48.631
Why doesn't he call me?

08:48.769 --> 08:50.633
Well, somebody's gotta
make the first move.

08:50.771 --> 08:53.049
Go ahead. Show him
you're bigger than he is.

08:53.187 --> 08:55.673
I can do that just
by standing next to him.

08:58.296 --> 09:02.265
Well, maybe
it's worth a try.

09:02.403 --> 09:04.474
But you know George
when he's mad.

09:04.613 --> 09:06.028
I'll bet he's down
there right now

09:06.166 --> 09:08.306
throwing spit balls
at our wedding picture.

09:19.973 --> 09:21.699
Everybody knows I'm home.
If I don't answer,

09:21.837 --> 09:23.873
somebody's gonna get
suspicious and come over.

09:26.704 --> 09:28.706
Okay. Answer it.

09:28.844 --> 09:32.088
But you know what happens
if I hear one wrong word.

09:32.951 --> 09:34.401
I guess that
leaves out "Help".

09:36.610 --> 09:39.199
Oh, hi, Louise.

09:40.441 --> 09:42.167
No, I'm not mad, Louise.

09:42.305 --> 09:44.238
All right, Weezy.

09:44.376 --> 09:47.863
Uh, no, I think
you better
stay up there.

09:48.001 --> 09:50.486
I think I'm gonna be
tied up here
a little while.

09:52.453 --> 09:54.559
Look, Weezy,
we'll work it out
later, okay?

09:55.733 --> 09:56.872
No, I'm not mad.

09:57.010 --> 09:58.839
Okay, then I am mad!

09:58.977 --> 10:00.841
Right, that's right!
I'm unreasonable!

10:00.979 --> 10:03.603
That's right,
I don't want you
to come home! Bye!

10:06.364 --> 10:08.055
Don't come home?

10:08.193 --> 10:09.885
Who does he think he is.

10:10.023 --> 10:11.507
I'm going down there
and tell him...

10:11.645 --> 10:13.474
Now, girl, don't do
anything drastic.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.788
Helen, what would you do
if Tom told you
not to come home?

10:16.926 --> 10:18.790
I'd kill him.

10:20.654 --> 10:23.553
Right. So if that
little shrimp is
dead tomorrow,

10:23.692 --> 10:25.417
you'll know
who did it.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.015
You ain't getting away
with this, you know.

10:37.153 --> 10:39.190
Oh, you're gonna
stop me, little man?

10:39.328 --> 10:43.332
Okay, look, why don't you
just take what you got
and get out of here, creep?

10:43.470 --> 10:45.437
Anybody ever tell you
you got a big mouth?

10:47.025 --> 10:48.786
WEEZY: George, where are you?

10:48.924 --> 10:50.408
Get out of here, Weezy!

10:51.512 --> 10:53.825
WEEZY: Don't you
tell me what to do!

10:55.482 --> 10:57.760
We're gonna have this
out right now!

10:57.898 --> 11:00.763
You wanna fight, little man,
okay you've got it!

11:00.901 --> 11:02.040
I've never seen...

11:05.699 --> 11:07.597
I told you
not to come home.

11:14.156 --> 11:15.675
Sorry, lady.

11:15.813 --> 11:18.194
You should have taken
your husband's advice
and stayed out of here.

11:18.332 --> 11:21.232
Oh, uh,
I'll take this.

11:22.198 --> 11:24.649
And this lovely ring.

11:24.787 --> 11:26.444
If you don't mind.

11:27.859 --> 11:29.619
Now,

11:29.758 --> 11:31.449
you be good
little people, right?

11:32.899 --> 11:34.659
You know, you're giving
me a big problem.

11:34.797 --> 11:37.248
We are giving
you a problem?
Yeah.

11:37.386 --> 11:38.559
You got so much
good stuff out there,

11:38.698 --> 11:40.320
I don't know
what to take next.

11:44.220 --> 11:45.497
Damn it!

11:46.775 --> 11:49.087
What are you doing?
I'm boogying.

11:51.331 --> 11:54.092
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm trying to knock
the phone all the hook.

11:54.230 --> 11:55.335
Then what?

11:55.473 --> 11:57.820
You can't even dial
a prayer like that.

11:58.856 --> 12:00.409
Yeah, you're right, Weezy.

12:00.547 --> 12:02.549
Boy, if I could just
get my hands loose,
I'd show that chump.

12:02.687 --> 12:05.310
Oh, don't get him mad.
He looks pretty rough to me.

12:05.448 --> 12:08.831
So what? I took care
of some big dudes
in my time.

12:08.969 --> 12:10.453
Remember what happened
to Monk Davis

12:10.591 --> 12:12.145
that time he tried
to blackmail me.

12:13.456 --> 12:14.803
Yeah.

12:16.839 --> 12:19.290
A TV stereo combination.
Nope.

12:19.877 --> 12:21.775
A dining room set.

12:21.913 --> 12:23.915
More personal than that.

12:24.053 --> 12:26.918
Hey, wait a minute.
I don't see nothing around
here looks that valuable.

12:27.056 --> 12:29.403
That's because
you're sitting on it.
Where?

12:29.541 --> 12:30.715
There!

12:37.964 --> 12:40.207
What's the matter
with you, nigger?

12:43.348 --> 12:44.591
You flipped?

12:44.729 --> 12:46.386
I'm giving you a chance
to save your butt.

12:46.524 --> 12:47.525
Now get out.

12:48.733 --> 12:50.217
I ain't leaving here
empty-handed.

12:50.355 --> 12:51.701
That's right!

12:51.840 --> 12:54.221
But first...

12:54.359 --> 12:56.603
And if that don't do it,
I still got my foot.

12:56.741 --> 12:57.777
And if that don't work...

12:57.915 --> 13:00.607
You're crazy!
You're crazy, nigger!

13:00.745 --> 13:04.059
Now you're gonna force me
to tell your family!

13:04.197 --> 13:06.440
Too late, sucker.
I already told them.

13:11.135 --> 13:14.103
Why'd you go and do
a dumb thing like that?

13:14.241 --> 13:15.656
Look, chump,
just get out of here!

13:17.037 --> 13:18.832
It's people like you,

13:19.868 --> 13:21.248
blabbermouths,

13:22.802 --> 13:25.321
that ruin the
blackmail business.

13:40.992 --> 13:43.719
And remember that chump
who tried to sell me those
flooded delivery vans?

13:45.514 --> 13:47.067
You're trying to
rip me off and get
away with it, Owens?

13:47.205 --> 13:48.448
Get out of here.

13:48.586 --> 13:50.830
All right, now just
a minute, buster.

13:50.968 --> 13:53.349
We got a deal,
and you're gonna stick to it.

13:54.661 --> 13:56.766
What? Okay, buster,

13:56.905 --> 13:58.734
try and stop me...

14:10.988 --> 14:13.645
And JoJo,
and Whittendale.

14:13.783 --> 14:15.889
You sure knew
how to get
rid of them, too.

14:18.961 --> 14:20.307
Did you call
my old lady dumb?

14:22.585 --> 14:24.622
Yeah. She's
all wet, man.

14:32.354 --> 14:34.287
Are you
quite finished?

14:34.425 --> 14:35.667
Not quite. Get out!

14:35.805 --> 14:37.497
What?
You heard me!

14:37.635 --> 14:39.948
Let the doormat
hit you where the
good Lord split you!

14:44.228 --> 14:47.403
Yeah, you got rid of some
tough cookies all right.

14:47.541 --> 14:49.716
But none of them
had a gun like
this one has.

14:50.268 --> 14:51.821
Yeah.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.341
I thought this was supposed
to be a security building?

14:54.479 --> 14:55.653
It is secure.

14:55.791 --> 14:57.206
Once a crook gets in,
he's secure.

14:58.587 --> 15:00.313
Ain't nobody gonna
bother him then.

15:01.314 --> 15:02.936
Well, what are
we gonna do?

15:03.074 --> 15:05.697
Well, at least we can
afford to buy one of
everything he steals.

15:05.835 --> 15:07.699
That's the good thing
about being robbed
when you're rich.

15:08.735 --> 15:10.495
Rich. Rich.

15:10.633 --> 15:13.326
I wish you would forget
about money once in a while.

15:13.464 --> 15:14.499
See that's your
trouble, Weezy.

15:14.637 --> 15:15.811
You got so
used to being poor,

15:15.949 --> 15:17.986
we finally got some money,
you didn't like it.

15:21.230 --> 15:22.887
It's not the money
I mind.

15:23.025 --> 15:25.752
It's the dumb things
you do with it
that drive me crazy.

15:26.477 --> 15:27.719
What dumb things?

15:27.857 --> 15:30.619
You always have to have
the biggest of everything.

15:30.757 --> 15:33.346
Like that dumb grand
piano you bought.

15:46.152 --> 15:47.291
I got an
idea, Ralph.

15:47.429 --> 15:49.396
You get behind,
I'll get in front.
Yes, sir.

15:52.158 --> 15:54.229
Ready, Ralph?
Ready, sir.

15:54.367 --> 15:56.024
Okay, when I say
"now," shove it.

15:59.613 --> 16:01.408
Sir?

16:01.546 --> 16:03.238
Just get behind there
and push.

16:03.376 --> 16:04.480
Now!

16:04.618 --> 16:06.275
I think it's beginning
to move, sir.

16:06.413 --> 16:08.070
Be careful!

16:08.208 --> 16:09.969
This armoire cost me
1,100 bucks.

16:10.107 --> 16:12.247
If it falls and breaks
you can forget your tip.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.560
Don't worry, sir,
if it does fall,

16:15.698 --> 16:17.804
I'll throw my body
between it and the floor.

16:19.875 --> 16:22.671
That's your trouble, George.
You overdo things.

16:22.809 --> 16:26.640
Yeah. I just hope that
burglar ain't overdoing
things out there.

16:26.778 --> 16:29.229
Oh, I hope he doesn't
take Uncle Ward's gift.

16:29.367 --> 16:30.955
Oh, don't worry
about it, Weezy.

16:31.093 --> 16:34.303
Ain't no place you can
fence a hand-painted
plastic candy dish.

16:36.650 --> 16:40.102
There you go, putting down
my Uncle Ward again.

16:40.240 --> 16:42.346
Look, I was just kidding,
Weezy. I like your uncle.

16:42.484 --> 16:43.864
Not at first you didn't.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.590
You sure gave him
a hard time,

16:45.728 --> 16:47.765
the way you kept
calling him "Uncle Tom".

16:50.699 --> 16:53.391
Tell me
something, George.

16:53.529 --> 16:55.980
You like to use words
"Uncle Tom" a lot.

16:56.118 --> 16:57.361
Only when it fits.

16:57.499 --> 16:59.328
Do you know who
Uncle Tom really was?

16:59.466 --> 17:02.883
Sure. He was that dumb
nigger who used to thank
Simon Legree for whipping him.

17:06.335 --> 17:07.785
Wrong. That's another
one of those lies

17:07.923 --> 17:09.994
about our people
that has been
accepted as truth.

17:10.132 --> 17:12.100
Who was he then?
Super Fly in disguise?

17:15.172 --> 17:17.829
No, George.
In real life,

17:17.967 --> 17:20.970
Uncle Tom was a slave
named Josiah Henson,

17:21.109 --> 17:23.076
who escaped and walked
all the way from Kentucky

17:23.214 --> 17:25.147
to Canada with his
wife and children.

17:25.285 --> 17:28.771
And there, he started
the first manual training
school for our people.

17:29.496 --> 17:31.602
How you know that?
I read.

17:31.740 --> 17:34.501
Sometimes I listen.
You could do the same thing.

17:34.639 --> 17:37.021
Oh.
You heard of the
underground railroad?

17:37.470 --> 17:38.643
Sure.

17:38.781 --> 17:40.128
Well, Josia Henson

17:40.266 --> 17:42.337
helped 100 slaves
escape up north

17:42.475 --> 17:44.753
even before there was
an underground railroad.

17:45.443 --> 17:47.100
He was a brave man.

17:47.238 --> 17:48.688
A great leader.

17:48.826 --> 17:51.070
And I'll tell you
something else, George.

17:51.208 --> 17:53.486
I'd never call you
an Uncle Tom.

18:00.355 --> 18:03.116
Oh, I couldn't have
been nicer to him
if he was my own uncle.

18:04.186 --> 18:06.050
Well, that's only fair.

18:06.188 --> 18:08.639
After all, I've put myself
out for your relatives.

18:09.329 --> 18:10.365
What relatives?

18:10.986 --> 18:12.056
Your mother.

18:13.022 --> 18:15.370
Mama? Mama ain't
no trouble at all.

18:19.270 --> 18:22.101
Mother Jefferson,
what a nice surprise.

18:22.239 --> 18:23.688
Hello, Louise.

18:23.826 --> 18:26.760
I was passing by
and thought I'd drop in.

18:26.898 --> 18:28.762
Well, I'm so glad
you did.

18:28.900 --> 18:32.628
I figured this would be
quicker than waiting
for an invitation.

18:35.493 --> 18:38.634
Well, uh, how do you
like our new apartment?

18:40.705 --> 18:44.709
Oh, it's lovely.
Just beautiful.

18:44.847 --> 18:47.436
George has
such good taste

18:48.575 --> 18:50.543
in most things.

18:52.441 --> 18:54.029
A maid?

18:54.167 --> 18:58.792
You're getting a maid
to look after this
itty-bitty apartment?

19:00.346 --> 19:01.692
Yes.

19:01.830 --> 19:05.385
Well, well,
all the years I was married,

19:05.523 --> 19:08.112
bringing up a family
in that great big house,

19:08.250 --> 19:09.976
we never had a maid.

19:10.114 --> 19:12.979
What great big house?
We had a three-room walk up.

19:14.429 --> 19:15.982
He doesn't remember.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.087
No, you mean,
you don't remember.

19:18.226 --> 19:19.951
Don't talk to your
mother like that.

19:20.089 --> 19:22.161
Now don't you
pick on George!

19:25.405 --> 19:26.993
He has enough
on his mind,

19:27.131 --> 19:29.409
trying to think up ways
to earn enough money

19:29.547 --> 19:32.412
to pay for your maid,
which you don't need.

19:33.310 --> 19:35.312
Oh, you see
there, George?

19:35.450 --> 19:37.383
Even your mother
agrees with me.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.351
Well, on,
on the other hand...

19:45.045 --> 19:47.082
I can understand
you wanting

19:47.220 --> 19:50.258
somebody to
keep the place
neat and clean...

19:53.088 --> 19:54.365
...for a change.

19:58.990 --> 20:02.304
A four letter word
for a heavenly body.

20:02.442 --> 20:03.478
Sun.

20:03.616 --> 20:07.896
S-U-N-N.

20:11.831 --> 20:13.798
Here's your Bloody Mary.

20:13.936 --> 20:15.455
Oh, thank you, Louise.

20:15.593 --> 20:17.285
It helps me think.

20:18.458 --> 20:20.978
Oh, are you having trouble
with the crossword puzzle?

20:21.116 --> 20:23.463
No, I always finish them.

20:23.601 --> 20:24.913
Those puzzles
are tough.

20:25.051 --> 20:26.501
You've got to
know a lot.

20:26.639 --> 20:30.021
Oh, but I do.
I have a brain
like a sponge.

20:33.956 --> 20:36.442
You must have
a liver like one, too.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.792
Have a nice ride.

20:41.930 --> 20:45.071
But I think Louise
needs a smaller seat.

20:46.037 --> 20:48.143
No, this is regulation size.

20:48.281 --> 20:51.664
I'm not talking about
the one on the bike.

20:57.911 --> 20:59.741
Yeah, boy,
I got some mama.

20:59.879 --> 21:01.570
She's funny,
ain't she, Weezy?

21:04.780 --> 21:06.817
Yeah, she sure is.

21:06.955 --> 21:11.684
Especially when it
comes to weddings
and engagement parties.

21:11.822 --> 21:13.410
You listen to me,
I'm not gonna
let you marry this guy.

21:13.548 --> 21:15.343
Why should
I listen to you?

21:15.481 --> 21:16.930
You didn't
listen to me

21:17.068 --> 21:19.588
when I told you
not to marry Louise.

21:23.627 --> 21:26.354
Hey, I'm on
your side!

21:26.492 --> 21:28.839
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.

21:28.977 --> 21:30.668
Now see what you
made me do?

21:30.806 --> 21:34.120
You made me say
something mean
about Louise!

21:34.258 --> 21:36.605
But, Mama, see
what I'm trying...
Keep your hands off me!

21:42.646 --> 21:45.925
Uh, wait, Mother Jefferson.
George didn't mean
what he said.

21:46.063 --> 21:48.307
I'm sorry, Louise,
I am going!

21:48.445 --> 21:52.103
George, I used to diaper you
when you were a baby.

21:52.241 --> 21:55.762
You were a mess then,
and you're still a mess!

22:00.664 --> 22:04.771
George, that's
your third drink.
I know that!

22:04.909 --> 22:07.015
Well, put it down.
Mama, would you
leave me alone, please?

22:07.153 --> 22:09.500
I said, put it down.
You've had enough.

22:09.638 --> 22:10.812
Look, Mama,
I'm a big boy now.

22:10.950 --> 22:12.469
I don't need you to
blow my nose for me.

22:12.607 --> 22:14.954
Now would you
leave me alone?
George...

22:15.092 --> 22:16.818
Oh, hi, there, Jefferson.

22:16.956 --> 22:20.097
That ain't very nice
talking that way
to your little mammy here.

22:26.275 --> 22:29.382
Who are you
calling Mammy?

22:29.520 --> 22:32.212
You.
Well, don't you dare
call me Mammy!

22:32.351 --> 22:35.526
I'm nobody's mammy!
I'm his mother!

22:35.664 --> 22:37.183
Now if you've got
anything to say to me,

22:37.321 --> 22:39.668
you call me
Mrs. Jefferson.

22:39.806 --> 22:41.843
Oh, geez,
Mrs. Jefferson...
Don't talk to me.

22:41.981 --> 22:43.154
That's telling him.

22:43.292 --> 22:45.191
And don't you try to
make up with me, either.

22:45.329 --> 22:46.537
But, Mother Jefferson,
what's wrong?

22:46.675 --> 22:48.677
Let me go!
I'm getting out of here!

22:48.815 --> 22:50.369
George, what's going on?

22:50.507 --> 22:51.611
He called
Mama "Mammy".

22:51.749 --> 22:53.372
Uh-oh.

22:53.510 --> 22:55.097
Geez, I didn't think
I was doing nothing wrong.

22:55.235 --> 22:57.376
I thought all colored people
call their mothers "Mammy".

22:57.514 --> 23:00.171
Well, I did, Jefferson.
That's what I always heard.

23:00.309 --> 23:03.140
Geez, Al Jolson called
his mother "Mammy" for years.

23:05.591 --> 23:08.904
Oh, the looks on your
faces were really something.

23:10.319 --> 23:12.460
Yeah, she really
told old Bunker, boy.

23:14.427 --> 23:15.842
All right!

23:17.844 --> 23:19.121
What's so funny?

23:29.338 --> 23:32.065
Look, you don't
have to keep pointing
that gun at us.

23:32.203 --> 23:33.481
Just take what
you want and leave.

23:33.619 --> 23:36.104
All right.
But not more noise.

23:37.208 --> 23:38.865
It makes me nervous.

23:42.282 --> 23:44.215
Hmm. That's just our
lousy luck.

23:44.353 --> 23:46.873
We don't even get
a cool cat.
We get a nervous wreck.

23:48.979 --> 23:51.430
George, isn't there something
we can do?

23:51.568 --> 23:55.019
Look, just be calm, Weezy.
He'll be gone soon,
and it'll be all over.

23:55.157 --> 23:58.747
Oh, but you read about people
being robbed and killed
all the time.

23:58.885 --> 24:00.991
Don't worry about it, Weezy.
I'm not gonna let you
get killed.

24:03.338 --> 24:05.374
You're scared, too,
aren't you?

24:05.513 --> 24:08.481
Well, I just hope it
ain't true that you
turn white with fear.

24:15.005 --> 24:18.111
You never think that something
like this will happen to you.

24:18.249 --> 24:20.079
Well, anyway, Weezy,
we can't just sit here.

24:20.217 --> 24:22.046
We can't?

24:22.184 --> 24:25.049
Look, just start sliding
your chair around, so we can
get them back-to-back.

24:25.187 --> 24:27.293
Then what?

24:27.431 --> 24:30.054
Then we'll untie the ropes
and make a run for it.

24:30.192 --> 24:32.574
I'm afraid we gotta make
a walk for it.

24:33.644 --> 24:35.266
I'm in no condition to run.

24:37.165 --> 24:38.407
Rest a second.

24:42.550 --> 24:43.792
You know,

24:47.520 --> 24:49.280
this may be a dumb thing
to say,

24:49.418 --> 24:52.180
but it's nice to
hold hands again.

24:53.526 --> 24:54.976
Maybe we should do this
more often.

24:58.048 --> 25:00.188
Oh, George, I love it
when you're like this.

25:01.361 --> 25:04.606
Instead of being grouchy
and unreasonable.

25:04.744 --> 25:06.919
Unreasonable?
When have I been unreasonable?

25:07.885 --> 25:10.336
When? So many times.

25:10.474 --> 25:12.787
I can't even begin
to count how many.

25:12.925 --> 25:14.236
Tell me one. Just one.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.136
How about the time

25:17.274 --> 25:20.173
poor Edith Bunker thought
Archie was gone for good.

25:20.311 --> 25:23.349
You'd just keep making
stupid jokes about him.

25:23.487 --> 25:25.489
I never joke
about Archie Bunker.

25:27.146 --> 25:28.319
Yes, you did.

25:29.976 --> 25:33.428
Dang it, Louise.
Why do you keep sticking up
for that honky?

25:33.566 --> 25:35.672
You hear the way
he's always bad mouthing us.

25:35.810 --> 25:38.019
The only thing worse
than his insults is
his compliments.

25:40.021 --> 25:44.128
"I said, Jefferson man,
you know why you people got
such natural rhythm?

25:44.266 --> 25:46.303
"From being brought up with
all them tom-toms."

25:48.650 --> 25:52.102
Then there's the bull about
just 'cause we black
we can't get enough sex.

25:53.931 --> 25:56.485
We both know that's bull,
don't we, George?

26:01.560 --> 26:03.044
You better lighten up, Louise.

26:03.182 --> 26:06.081
But you do have rhythm.
One out of two ain't bad.

26:12.225 --> 26:16.126
Now, you're going too far.
You hear that, Louise?
Too far!

26:16.264 --> 26:18.059
Don't you slam my table.

26:18.197 --> 26:20.579
What? I'll slam your table!

26:20.717 --> 26:23.478
I'll slam your chair!
I'll slam your wall!

26:23.616 --> 26:25.066
Anything else you want me
to slam?

26:25.204 --> 26:27.862
Yes! The door from
the other side!

26:29.588 --> 26:30.658
You got it!

26:38.355 --> 26:42.048
Okay, so sometimes
I get mad and yell a little.
I don't do it all the time.

26:42.186 --> 26:43.291
That's right.

26:43.429 --> 26:45.534
When you can't think of
anything to yell about,

26:45.673 --> 26:48.330
you run to your favorite
hiding place.

26:50.643 --> 26:52.645
Where are you going?
Someplace where I can think!

26:54.613 --> 26:56.476
George, you're talking like
a damn fool!

27:01.309 --> 27:02.344
JENNY: That's true.

27:02.482 --> 27:03.483
Mama...

27:04.450 --> 27:06.452
Mother knows best, George.

27:06.590 --> 27:09.110
All right, hold, hold, hold,
wait a minute.
Look, what is this?

27:09.248 --> 27:10.698
Now everybody just get
off my back!

27:10.836 --> 27:12.147
Now I am the man
of this house,

27:12.285 --> 27:13.286
and I don't wanna hear
no more of this talk!

27:13.424 --> 27:14.529
Understand?

27:14.667 --> 27:16.048
What are you gonna do
about it?

27:16.186 --> 27:18.050
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

27:18.188 --> 27:20.535
I'll tell you what
I'm gonna do!
I'm going to the john!

27:24.573 --> 27:27.818
Oh, Mr. Jefferson.

27:27.956 --> 27:29.233
Oh, oh.

27:29.371 --> 27:30.372
Ooh, I love your legs.

27:34.376 --> 27:36.758
Why don't you sit down
and let's talk this
over rationally?

27:36.896 --> 27:38.035
Good idea.

27:43.247 --> 27:44.214
He went into the john.

27:45.629 --> 27:46.872
Well, you told him to
sit down.

27:48.563 --> 27:49.564
Where do you think
you're going?

27:49.702 --> 27:51.221
Where I don't have to
listen to you.

27:51.359 --> 27:53.223
Oh, no, you don't.
You're not running away
from me this time.

27:53.361 --> 27:54.742
Oh, George, open that door!

27:54.880 --> 27:55.846
I don't have to listen
to you.

27:57.572 --> 27:59.263
This is ridiculous.

27:59.401 --> 28:01.956
Can you believe two
grown men acting like that?

28:02.094 --> 28:06.098
What grown men?
They get upset
and they run to the potty.

28:09.791 --> 28:11.586
At least I ain't
as bad as you,

28:11.724 --> 28:14.002
getting mad and yelling,
and making a big fuss
over nothing.

28:14.969 --> 28:17.661
When did I make a big fuss
over nothing?

28:17.799 --> 28:20.077
Valentine's Day when
I didn't bring you nothing.

28:21.734 --> 28:25.531
Then you let them old crazy
Willises use their encounter
techniques on us.

28:27.326 --> 28:28.568
It worked, didn't it?

28:31.364 --> 28:34.160
Okay, now what?
Well, just relax.

28:34.298 --> 28:36.576
Um, why don't you start,
Louise?

28:36.715 --> 28:39.165
Just mention whatever
comes to mind.

28:39.303 --> 28:41.167
What am I supposed to do?

28:41.305 --> 28:43.963
You answer her with
the first thing that comes to
your mind, without thinking.

28:44.101 --> 28:45.689
Just like you always do,
George.

28:49.003 --> 28:50.798
Okay, go!

28:51.764 --> 28:54.318
Okay, uh, hot.
Cold.

28:54.456 --> 28:55.699
Sweet.
Sour.

28:55.837 --> 28:56.907
Good.
Me.

29:03.120 --> 29:06.123
"Me"? How did you
come by "me"?

29:06.261 --> 29:07.953
'Cause it's good of me
to sit through this junk.

29:09.644 --> 29:11.508
George!
It's all right, Louise.

29:11.646 --> 29:14.269
If that's the first thing that
came to his mind,
that's what he should say.

29:14.407 --> 29:15.684
Now go on.

29:15.823 --> 29:17.894
Uh, high.
Taxes.

29:18.032 --> 29:19.067
Low.
Interest.

29:19.205 --> 29:20.206
Money.
Trucks.

29:20.344 --> 29:22.312
Hold it.

29:22.450 --> 29:26.868
I know I'm not supposed
to interrupt, but what does
a truck have to do with money?

29:27.006 --> 29:29.940
Plenty.
A truck goes by a curb,
splashes mud on suit.

29:30.078 --> 29:32.184
Suit goes to cleaners.
I make money.

29:38.086 --> 29:39.743
Wait a minute, you two.

29:39.881 --> 29:43.402
The whole purpose of
this thing is to dig into
your relationship.

29:43.540 --> 29:46.405
Yes, you must be much
more personal.

29:46.543 --> 29:47.958
Now just forget that
we're here.

29:48.096 --> 29:50.271
I wish I could.

29:50.409 --> 29:53.239
Now listen you...
It was the first thing
that popped into my mind.

29:55.069 --> 29:56.829
Start again. And this time,
make it personal.

29:58.762 --> 30:00.108
Marriage.
Ring.

30:00.246 --> 30:01.454
Sex.
Seven.

30:05.493 --> 30:07.012
I said "sex."

30:07.150 --> 30:08.668
Oh, oh, I thought
you said "six".

30:14.916 --> 30:16.607
For a minute there
he had me worried.

30:19.369 --> 30:20.819
The part I liked best
was the potakas.

30:22.234 --> 30:24.650
Like that?
No. Like this.

30:32.692 --> 30:36.144
You're right, Helen.
I feel better already.

30:36.938 --> 30:38.112
Oh, yeah?

30:40.217 --> 30:41.184
Get him, Louise.

30:44.946 --> 30:46.810
Hold him. That's enough.

30:46.948 --> 30:48.536
Now you feel much better,
Louise.

30:48.674 --> 30:50.952
Very good.

30:51.090 --> 30:54.128
Yes. Go on, the point is
trying to get
the juices flowing, that's it.

31:07.003 --> 31:08.556
You know something, Willis?

31:08.694 --> 31:11.352
For once in your life,
you're right.
I feel much better now.

31:12.249 --> 31:13.630
Me, too.

31:13.768 --> 31:15.977
That's the whole point,
you see?

31:16.115 --> 31:19.670
You've gotten rid of
that anger. Now you can
speak freely and easily.

31:19.808 --> 31:23.226
And clear up any problem,
no matter how big,
without fighting.

31:23.364 --> 31:25.262
Good. Is this what
they do at those meetings?

31:25.400 --> 31:26.677
Oh, sometimes.

31:26.815 --> 31:28.403
Well, me and Weezy
ain't gotta go then.

31:28.541 --> 31:31.268
When we get uptight,
we'll just beat
each other's brains in.

31:32.545 --> 31:35.652
That's not fair
because Louise
will always finish first.

31:41.209 --> 31:42.555
Well, I guess we can go now.

31:42.693 --> 31:44.488
May we have our potakas back?

31:44.626 --> 31:47.940
No, wait a minute.
I got one little teeny piece
of anger to get rid of yet.

31:48.941 --> 31:50.149
Oh, go ahead,
let her have it.

31:50.632 --> 31:51.633
Ow!

31:52.600 --> 31:53.808
Hey, you can't do that!

31:53.946 --> 31:55.361
Why not? You said
it's good for everybody.

31:55.499 --> 31:56.466
That's right.

31:57.708 --> 31:59.227
Oh, George, I'm gonna
do something.

32:11.860 --> 32:13.862
Stop it! Stop it, I said!

32:16.451 --> 32:18.971
You ought to be ashamed
of yourselves, fighting like
that on the Lord's day!

32:21.284 --> 32:23.769
Florence, how would you
like it if I never got
mad at you again?

32:23.907 --> 32:25.081
That would be a blessing.

32:25.219 --> 32:26.427
And how would you like it
if you never got mad at me?

32:26.565 --> 32:27.669
Now that would be a miracle.

32:27.807 --> 32:29.844
Okay, stay right there
a minute.

32:38.301 --> 32:39.336
There.

32:48.311 --> 32:49.864
I wish I had a club right now
I could hit that crook with.

32:51.624 --> 32:53.040
What's he doing
out there anyway?
Messing up the place?

32:53.178 --> 32:56.353
Don't worry about that.
Florence will help me
straighten it up.

32:56.491 --> 32:59.494
Hey, remember when
we first hired Florence?

32:59.632 --> 33:00.702
Yeah.

33:04.913 --> 33:06.087
But there's just one thing.

33:07.054 --> 33:08.779
Do you folks mind if
I ask you something?

33:08.917 --> 33:10.436
No, go right ahead.

33:10.574 --> 33:12.576
Now you live in
this apartment, right?
Uh-huh.

33:12.714 --> 33:15.614
And you got an apartment
in this building, too?
Yes, that's right.

33:16.822 --> 33:19.273
Well, how come we overcame
and nobody told me?

33:31.250 --> 33:33.080
Yeah. And now nobody can't
tell her nothing.

33:37.291 --> 33:39.741
Doorbell! Will somebody
get the door?

33:48.267 --> 33:50.442
Will somebody
get the door?

33:56.275 --> 33:59.037
Will somebody
get the door,
Florence?

34:01.453 --> 34:02.971
I wish you would
make up your mind.

34:03.110 --> 34:05.043
Either you want dinner
or you want doors.

34:07.217 --> 34:09.530
'Cause if you want both,
you want another maid.

34:13.844 --> 34:15.053
Hello, Florence.

34:15.191 --> 34:16.640
Hello, Mrs. Jefferson.

34:16.778 --> 34:17.779
They're in the bedroom.

34:17.917 --> 34:19.678
Would you tell them
I'm here, please?

34:19.816 --> 34:20.817
She's here!

34:25.753 --> 34:27.651
How about a Bloody Mary?

34:27.789 --> 34:29.377
No, thanks. I don't
drink while I'm working.

34:31.172 --> 34:32.760
Hey, is somebody
gonna get that door?

34:34.762 --> 34:36.212
Why do you think
I pay you?

34:36.350 --> 34:38.869
Evidently, to get rid
of your small change.

34:40.595 --> 34:42.183
You know,
in my building,

34:42.321 --> 34:43.805
the roaches are so big

34:43.943 --> 34:46.946
that when you step on 'em,
the crunch drowns out
the television.

34:56.853 --> 34:58.337
And they just go "splat"!

35:08.934 --> 35:11.833
Oh, you're wasting your time,
because there ain't no woman
who no match for no man.

35:11.971 --> 35:14.871
Ha! You're wrong
about that, honey.
Just come at me.

35:15.009 --> 35:16.390
This is the most
ridiculous thing...

35:16.528 --> 35:17.943
Pah-poom!

35:20.187 --> 35:21.809
The hell kind of
fighting is that?

35:24.501 --> 35:25.468
Dirty.

35:25.606 --> 35:27.263
The same way
the muggers fight.

35:27.401 --> 35:28.781
Now get on your feet,
turkey.

35:30.266 --> 35:32.130
Ah! Hey!

35:32.268 --> 35:33.959
And here's how we call
for the police.

35:34.097 --> 35:35.098
Ah!

35:36.789 --> 35:38.722
That's very good, Florence.

35:39.378 --> 35:40.828
Are you all right, George?

35:40.966 --> 35:42.070
Are you kidding?

35:42.209 --> 35:44.176
I just been attacked
by the bionic maid.

35:46.696 --> 35:49.664
Anyway, I'm glad I loaned
Florence my earrings tonight.

35:49.802 --> 35:51.873
At least they won't
get stolen.

35:52.011 --> 35:54.704
Yeah. I wish she
was wearing the TV set.

35:56.257 --> 35:57.776
Somebody's at the door.

35:57.914 --> 36:00.054
Oh, thank God.
Maybe we're saved.

36:00.192 --> 36:02.332
With our luck, it's probably
the Avon lady calling.

36:15.518 --> 36:19.038
That's just like George.
He knows it's us,
so he won't open the door.

36:19.936 --> 36:22.594
Maybe they made up
and went out.

36:22.732 --> 36:24.941
No, he's still in there.
I can hear him breathing.

36:25.079 --> 36:26.080
Listen.

36:29.290 --> 36:31.775
Oh, now, that's really rude.

36:31.913 --> 36:33.570
I just heard him
bolt the door.

36:34.330 --> 36:36.711
I heard you do that,
George!

36:40.508 --> 36:42.372
I'm surprised Louise
let him do it.

36:42.510 --> 36:44.995
I bet she didn't even see him.
She's probably busy
in the kitchen.

36:45.133 --> 36:46.928
Well, come on.
Let's go.

36:47.066 --> 36:49.276
Have you ever noticed
how their arguments

36:49.414 --> 36:51.312
always end up as
our arguments?

36:55.661 --> 36:59.182
George, why do we
have to fight so much?

36:59.320 --> 37:03.669
If we have a problem,
why can't we just talk it
through like Tom and Helen?

37:03.807 --> 37:05.015
They don't fight.

37:05.153 --> 37:06.224
They don't fight 'cause
they're scared to fight.

37:06.362 --> 37:07.639
What's that supposed
to mean?

37:07.777 --> 37:09.296
You know damn well
what it means.

37:09.434 --> 37:11.539
If you two ever really
started going at
one another,

37:11.677 --> 37:13.610
inside of five minutes,
he'd be calling you...

37:13.748 --> 37:14.680
Don't say it!
Nigger!

37:14.818 --> 37:15.819
Pete's sake!

37:26.554 --> 37:28.176
Now, you listen to me.

37:28.315 --> 37:30.627
We've had lots of fights,
and it's never happened.

37:30.765 --> 37:32.457
Oh, don't tell me
it never crossed your mind.

37:32.595 --> 37:35.667
No more than it ever crossed
my mind to say the word
"honky" to Tom.

37:35.805 --> 37:37.600
Ha! Well, how come
you said it just then?

37:37.738 --> 37:38.946
Come on, dear, let's go.

37:40.119 --> 37:43.053
That's the best idea
you've had all day.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.919
Ah, they're gone.

37:47.057 --> 37:50.060
Yes, lucky for you,
you know when to keep
your mouth shut, buster.

37:50.198 --> 37:52.339
Hey, you were
a real good boy.

37:53.478 --> 37:54.927
Don't do that, turkey!

37:55.514 --> 37:56.688
George...

37:56.826 --> 37:58.655
You better listen to her,
buster, she's smart.

37:58.793 --> 37:59.898
When you going
to get out of here?

38:00.036 --> 38:01.762
Just as soon as
my bags are packed.

38:06.387 --> 38:08.493
I wonder who it was
at the door.

38:08.631 --> 38:10.667
Probably that
weird old Bentley.

38:10.805 --> 38:12.324
Well, I'm glad
he went away.

38:12.462 --> 38:14.153
I wouldn't like
to see him get hurt.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.879
He ain't gonna get hurt.

38:16.017 --> 38:17.985
He'd just put that kook
to sleep with one of
his dumb stories.

38:19.331 --> 38:21.022
I'll never forget
my first bicycle.

38:21.160 --> 38:23.991
A sleek racer with
distinctive red stripes,

38:24.129 --> 38:26.787
and a little bell that went
ching-a-ding!

38:26.925 --> 38:27.891
Ching-a-ding-ding!

38:28.754 --> 38:29.928
Ching-a-ding!

38:30.066 --> 38:31.964
I bet you got a big kick
out of riding it.

38:32.102 --> 38:33.690
Oh, no, I never
rode it at all.

38:33.828 --> 38:34.898
Why?

38:35.036 --> 38:36.728
It was stolen
the very first day
I had it.

38:37.522 --> 38:38.661
Oh.

38:38.799 --> 38:41.319
Yes, I've often wondered
what became of it.

38:41.457 --> 38:44.322
And then one day,
five years later,

38:44.460 --> 38:46.600
I was strolling along
the beach at Brighton

38:46.738 --> 38:50.742
when suddenly I saw
a bicycle which had
been washed ashore.

38:50.880 --> 38:55.540
It was all rusted over,
but there were still flecks
of red paint on it.

38:55.678 --> 38:57.680
Don't tell me it was
your bike.

38:57.818 --> 38:59.475
Oh, no, it was a lady's bike.

38:59.613 --> 39:02.340
But had it been mine,
wouldn't that have made
a remarkable story?

39:04.652 --> 39:06.620
Okay, Weezy, it looks like
we gotta do it
all by ourselves.

39:06.758 --> 39:07.828
Let's work on these ropes.

39:10.900 --> 39:12.246
Oh, it, it's no use.

39:13.212 --> 39:15.076
They won't budge.

39:15.214 --> 39:18.183
Four years in the Navy
learning how to tie knots.

39:18.321 --> 39:20.116
How come they don't teach you
how to untie them?

39:22.083 --> 39:24.707
I don't like to think
about your Navy days.

39:24.845 --> 39:27.088
That was the longest
we've ever been apart.

39:27.226 --> 39:29.850
Well then think of the
good part when I came
home on leave.

39:32.231 --> 39:34.613
Yeah, just you and me.

39:35.683 --> 39:38.445
We sure did a lot
of walking in the park.

39:38.583 --> 39:40.481
And a lot of resting
in the bushes.

39:43.726 --> 39:47.385
Sometimes I think a hot dog
at Coney Island was more fun

39:47.523 --> 39:49.835
than the fancy restaurants
we go to now.

39:49.973 --> 39:53.460
Oh, don't be silly, Weezy.
Being rich is much more fun.

39:53.598 --> 39:57.015
You don't like remembering
when you were poor,
do you, George?

39:57.153 --> 40:01.088
That's why you have
those nightmares anytime
something goes wrong.

40:01.226 --> 40:04.125
Well, now that that's
all cleared up,
don't you feel better now?

40:04.263 --> 40:07.025
No! 'Cause that's
the good part of the dream.

40:09.786 --> 40:12.340
I kept slipping down
that ladder,
and then all of a sudden

40:12.479 --> 40:14.066
I was in the subway.

40:14.204 --> 40:17.725
Did you have a token,
or did you sneak in
under the turnstile?

40:17.863 --> 40:20.210
I fell in through the roof,
right into the middle of
the A train!

40:21.453 --> 40:22.834
It was full of zebras.

40:27.355 --> 40:30.531
I mean, there was
zebras everywhere.
Snorting, and stomping,

40:30.669 --> 40:32.222
and chewing and messing up
the place.

40:32.360 --> 40:34.466
Weezy, ain't nothing uglier
than an A train
full of zebras.

40:36.330 --> 40:38.332
I'm not gonna explain
that one to you, George.

40:39.644 --> 40:41.887
And then at the first stop
I got off,

40:42.025 --> 40:43.855
and I ran onto
the up escalator,

40:43.993 --> 40:46.409
only it was going down.
Somebody switched signs on me.

40:46.547 --> 40:48.549
'Cause right next to me was
a down escalator

40:48.687 --> 40:50.827
with a bottle of champagne
with a white label on it.

40:50.965 --> 40:52.691
And the bottle
was going up, up, up.

40:52.829 --> 40:55.487
And I was going down,
down, down.

40:55.625 --> 40:57.109
And at the bottom, you ain't
gonna believe this, Weezy.

40:58.801 --> 41:01.631
At the bottom was
all of these cockroaches,

41:01.769 --> 41:04.082
yelling and waving,
"Welcome back, George."

41:09.467 --> 41:10.433
Weezy...

41:11.192 --> 41:12.262
George...
Weezy!

41:15.645 --> 41:17.233
Where were you?

41:17.371 --> 41:18.890
Here.
Why wasn't you there?

41:20.270 --> 41:21.893
Where?
In my dream! I needed you!

41:23.239 --> 41:25.068
Oh, you had a nightmare.

41:25.448 --> 41:27.070
The worst.

41:27.208 --> 41:29.245
I was walking down the street
and everybody was
the same color.

41:30.971 --> 41:32.179
It was terrible.

41:32.697 --> 41:34.319
Why?

41:34.457 --> 41:38.047
Because I couldn't tell
the white blacks from
the black blacks.

41:38.185 --> 41:39.220
Oh, George.

41:39.358 --> 41:41.015
Wait, that's just
the beginning.

41:41.153 --> 41:42.948
Then suddenly everybody
started chasing me.

41:43.086 --> 41:45.123
And I ran and ran until
I got to Monticello,

41:45.261 --> 41:46.952
in the midst of
this great big party.

41:47.090 --> 41:49.886
And Thomas Jefferson was there
playing the violin.

41:53.925 --> 41:55.271
Well, what's so bad
about that?

41:56.444 --> 41:57.722
He was using me as the bow.

42:00.414 --> 42:03.486
Scraping me back and forth.
Back and forth,
back and forth.

42:04.729 --> 42:06.316
Did you sound good?

42:06.454 --> 42:09.181
Terrible. Only thing
we could play was Dixie.

42:12.219 --> 42:13.220
Go to sleep, George.

42:13.910 --> 42:15.015
Okay.

42:15.153 --> 42:16.395
What are you doing?

42:16.534 --> 42:17.638
This time you're going
with me.

42:21.297 --> 42:23.610
You know, Weezy, when you
got it as good as we do,

42:23.748 --> 42:25.888
you don't like to think back
because you're afraid
it's gonna hurt.

42:26.026 --> 42:29.477
But it don't hurt at all.
I mean, we got a lot to think
back on, don't we?

42:29.616 --> 42:32.826
Yeah. Even the bad times
seem good at a time
like this.

42:32.964 --> 42:35.553
Hmm. Even old Archie Bunker
would look good to me now.

42:37.624 --> 42:39.867
Remember when we moved in
next door to him?

42:41.006 --> 42:42.525
Oh...

42:42.663 --> 42:44.458
You know what just crossed
my mind?

42:44.596 --> 42:45.873
Remember old man McNab?

42:46.011 --> 42:47.634
Yeah.
He used to live down
the street there?

42:47.772 --> 42:50.153
Remember the time that
he was gonna sell his place
to them Jews?

42:50.291 --> 42:52.052
Oh.

42:52.190 --> 42:54.502
And you come around with
that petition for
all the rest of us to sign.

42:54.641 --> 42:56.056
Remember, to keep them out?

42:56.194 --> 42:57.644
And we all signed it, huh?
Yeah.

42:57.782 --> 42:59.335
Yeah.

42:59.473 --> 43:01.648
You really saved the block
that time, Jim.

43:01.786 --> 43:03.581
Well, you know me.

43:03.719 --> 43:05.962
So, I mean, you wouldn't
then turn around

43:06.100 --> 43:08.309
and, and do what McNab
was trying to do, would you?

43:08.447 --> 43:09.966
You mean sell to Jews?
Yeah.

43:10.104 --> 43:11.347
Oh, no.

43:12.693 --> 43:13.660
No.

43:15.489 --> 43:18.078
These people are Baptists.
Right, right.

43:19.597 --> 43:20.943
Oh, that's nice.

43:21.081 --> 43:24.084
Hello, Mr. Bowman,
I just talked with
the telephone company,

43:24.222 --> 43:26.327
and they're putting
my phone in today.

43:26.465 --> 43:28.398
Now I really believe
the house is mine.

43:29.158 --> 43:30.608
Oh, hi, neighbor.

43:40.721 --> 43:41.688
Archie...

43:44.311 --> 43:46.140
My, you got here early.

43:46.278 --> 43:48.487
Well, I wanted to get
right to work.

43:48.626 --> 43:52.768
Oh, by the way, would it be
too much trouble to borrow
a pail from you?

43:52.906 --> 43:54.873
I forgot to bring one.
Oh, sure.

43:55.011 --> 43:57.082
Oh, you got your work
cut out for you.

43:57.220 --> 44:01.880
I don't think that house
has been cleaned since
his wife died three years ago.

44:02.018 --> 44:03.330
And way before that.

44:03.468 --> 44:06.989
Bowman and his wife
was always slobs,
the both of them.

44:07.127 --> 44:09.232
Archie. I'll get the pail.

44:09.370 --> 44:10.371
Thank you.

44:34.533 --> 44:36.052
Hurry up in there,
will you, Edith?

44:44.405 --> 44:45.372
Well, uh,

44:46.614 --> 44:48.340
how'd you like the
Juliashow last night?

44:53.000 --> 44:55.693
Fine.
How did you like Doris Day?

44:57.591 --> 44:59.869
Oh, you're in!
No, I ain't. I'm out.

45:00.007 --> 45:02.147
But you're on my stoop.
That's the same as
being in my house.

45:02.285 --> 45:03.908
Stoops don't count.

45:04.046 --> 45:06.358
Stoops always count.
Stoops never count.
Don't turn your back on me!

45:06.496 --> 45:08.567
Oh, there you are.
Back in!

45:08.706 --> 45:11.225
Now, you're in,
you're in for sure.

45:11.363 --> 45:13.641
So finally,
the great Jefferson,

45:13.780 --> 45:17.162
who always reclined
to cross my threshold
is into the house.

45:17.300 --> 45:19.924
All duded up with a flower
in his lapel there.

45:20.062 --> 45:22.754
Or is that one of them things
that squirt in your eye?
No, it's real.

45:25.412 --> 45:26.896
I wear a fresh one every day.

45:27.034 --> 45:30.210
Oh, you don't blow money
on a fresh flower every day.

45:30.348 --> 45:33.420
No, I steal one every day
from a blind flower girl.

45:33.558 --> 45:35.560
Oh, he's joking.

45:35.698 --> 45:38.080
George, they don't
know you here. He's joking.

45:38.218 --> 45:39.288
Louise.

45:41.117 --> 45:42.532
I'll tell them
when I'm joking.

45:43.395 --> 45:44.396
I was joking.

45:45.225 --> 45:47.952
Archie, are you in bed yet?

45:48.090 --> 45:51.024
ARCHIE: No, not yet, Edith,
I'm looking out the window.

45:51.162 --> 45:52.922
You know, the Jeffersons
left their shades up.

45:54.682 --> 45:57.893
Did you know they was putting
new wallpaper on the wall
of their bedroom?

45:58.894 --> 46:02.035
Holy cow, them coloreds
are wild about stripes.

46:06.177 --> 46:07.454
Bunker, come down here!

46:09.352 --> 46:11.113
ARCHIE: That don't sound like
your voice, Edith.

46:12.942 --> 46:17.188
No, Archie, we got company.
Yeah, so I see.

46:18.154 --> 46:19.259
Thanks for letting me know.

46:20.674 --> 46:23.159
Yeah, those Bunkers were
something else, weren't they?

46:23.297 --> 46:26.059
Yeah. But I still miss Edith.

46:26.197 --> 46:29.648
She was so upset
when we moved out
of the neighborhood.

46:29.787 --> 46:33.618
Louise? I bought you
some fruit for your trip.

46:35.793 --> 46:37.622
We're only
going to Manhattan.

46:38.623 --> 46:41.971
Well, subways break down
sometimes.

46:45.630 --> 46:47.114
Well, Edith,

46:47.252 --> 46:49.530
I guess this is
really goodbye.

46:51.670 --> 46:52.671
I know.

46:54.052 --> 46:56.537
Well, I'll just say so long.

46:57.366 --> 46:58.332
So long, Edith.

47:01.301 --> 47:02.302
Louise,

47:04.752 --> 47:06.064
did I ever tell you

47:07.341 --> 47:08.446
I love you?

47:09.896 --> 47:12.450
Every minute
we've spent together.

47:18.836 --> 47:20.009
You'd better go now,

47:21.355 --> 47:23.599
before the both of us
get awful wet.

47:25.566 --> 47:26.740
Bye, Louise.

47:32.401 --> 47:34.506
I mean, so long.

47:41.893 --> 47:43.584
What seems to be
the hold up in here?

47:43.722 --> 47:45.138
You still haven't finished
packing yet?

47:45.276 --> 47:46.656
Uh, just one more thing.

47:47.140 --> 47:48.831
Your coffee mug.

47:48.969 --> 47:50.591
I won't be drinking out
of mugs no more.

47:52.421 --> 47:55.113
From now on,
it's cups and saucers
all the way.

47:55.251 --> 47:56.943
Come on, Louise,
the limousine is waiting.

48:01.533 --> 48:02.776
Limousine?

48:03.950 --> 48:05.227
Have you gone crazy?

48:05.365 --> 48:06.849
What do we need
a limousine for?

48:06.987 --> 48:09.369
Because we're gonna leave
Bunkersville in style.

48:11.405 --> 48:12.924
Come on, Weezy.

48:13.062 --> 48:14.719
Things are looking good
for us.

48:14.857 --> 48:17.239
Look, you deserve the best.

48:18.343 --> 48:20.863
And that's exactly what
you're gonna get. The best.

48:22.071 --> 48:23.038
Okay?

48:24.246 --> 48:25.212
Here.

48:30.355 --> 48:33.634
I wish that chump out there
would move to
a new neighborhood.

48:33.772 --> 48:35.360
Oh, I just thought of
something awful.

48:36.292 --> 48:37.638
Worse than him?

48:37.776 --> 48:40.848
Yeah, what will happen if
we want to go to the bathroom?

48:42.126 --> 48:43.196
I wish you hadn't said that.

48:52.412 --> 48:54.655
Well, still behaving
yourselves?

48:55.208 --> 48:56.623
That's nice.

48:57.831 --> 48:59.867
When are you gonna
get out of here?

49:00.006 --> 49:02.905
What, are you kidding?
I haven't even started
on the bedrooms yet.

49:04.424 --> 49:07.668
Oh, hey, lady,
you're a good cook.

49:09.498 --> 49:10.533
Thank you.

49:13.398 --> 49:16.194
That reminds me,
I'm starving.

49:16.332 --> 49:18.507
Just like old times,
huh?

49:18.645 --> 49:21.303
Yeah. Remember those
chocolate cakes you
used to make? Mmm...

49:21.441 --> 49:24.582
I remember what you tried
to do with one of them.

49:26.653 --> 49:29.345
Look, I know what you're
thinking, Bunker. But I'm
talking about all the people.

49:29.483 --> 49:31.899
Blacks, browns,
yellows and whites.

49:32.038 --> 49:34.350
How come you put the
whites last?

49:36.111 --> 49:38.665
Look, I just wanna help
the community.

49:39.183 --> 49:41.771
Edith, the phone.

49:41.909 --> 49:43.221
Well, if you wanna
help the community,

49:43.359 --> 49:45.706
you can bring the prices
down in your store there.

49:45.844 --> 49:49.365
EDITH: Hello?
I mean, $12 to fix
that hole, that's a disgrace.

49:49.503 --> 49:53.404
Yeah, Louise,
he's here.
Oh...

49:56.200 --> 50:00.514
Louise wants to know
what happened to her
chocolate cake.

50:00.652 --> 50:03.069
Oh, the cake, huh?

50:03.207 --> 50:07.211
Tell Louise that George is
over here trying to
buy votes with it.

50:08.764 --> 50:12.147
Yeah, I'll tell him,
Louise. Goodbye.

50:12.285 --> 50:16.668
Louise wants to see you
back home right away.

50:16.806 --> 50:21.949
Imagine that. Only one day
in politics, and already
he's stealing and bribing.

50:23.917 --> 50:27.507
And now he expects
me to sign this
here petition of his.

50:27.645 --> 50:31.787
Look, I hear you loud
and clear, Bunker. And I
don't need you anyway.

50:33.409 --> 50:36.033
You ain't the only
honky on the beach.

50:39.450 --> 50:43.764
Can you beat that?
A guy comes waltzing in
here with a petition.

50:43.902 --> 50:46.353
Wants me to
sign the thing
without even reading it.

50:46.491 --> 50:48.838
Now, I mean,
he takes the cake.

51:03.543 --> 51:06.856
Yeah. Archie could
drive you mad.

51:06.994 --> 51:09.859
But at least he was
the devil we knew.

51:09.997 --> 51:14.554
When we moved here I was
so worried about the new
people we were going to meet.

51:14.692 --> 51:17.660
And then the first
neighbor we met
was Mr. Bentley.

51:17.798 --> 51:20.318
He was so nice
and friendly.

51:20.698 --> 51:22.079
And weird.

51:27.981 --> 51:29.258
Oh, yes!

51:29.396 --> 51:30.742
Ah, that's it! Right there.

51:30.880 --> 51:32.054
Oh, that's heavy.

51:32.192 --> 51:33.814
Any particular reason
why we're doing this?

51:35.299 --> 51:37.473
It's the only thing
that seems to help my back.

51:37.922 --> 51:38.923
Marvelous.

51:39.682 --> 51:41.650
It's working, it's working.

51:43.962 --> 51:45.309
It worked.

51:45.447 --> 51:48.691
Thank you, Mr. Jefferson.
You have kind feet.

51:48.829 --> 51:53.213
Well, anything I can do
for you, don't hesitate
to ring my bell.

51:53.696 --> 51:54.697
Buh-bye.

52:02.119 --> 52:03.120
What the hell was that?

52:04.673 --> 52:07.745
George, I believe
you were right about
this place after all.

52:07.883 --> 52:10.679
Imagine, an English neighbor.

52:12.025 --> 52:13.785
Good God, you're black.

52:20.102 --> 52:21.414
Something wrong with that?

52:21.552 --> 52:24.934
Oh, no! No, I just
didn't notice before.

52:25.072 --> 52:26.695
Well. Jambo!

52:26.833 --> 52:28.421
Did you say "samba"?

52:29.560 --> 52:31.941
No, no. Jambo,
it's Swahili.

52:32.079 --> 52:36.153
Actually, it means "hello".
I never can remember
the word for "goodbye".

52:42.952 --> 52:45.265
You think Mr. Bentley
is weird?

52:45.403 --> 52:48.199
Have you ever
taken a good
look at us?

52:48.337 --> 52:50.960
What are you talking
about? Ain't nothing
strange about us.

52:51.098 --> 52:52.652
Oh, no?

52:53.687 --> 52:55.206
You wanna try it again?
Well...

52:55.344 --> 52:56.518
Knock, knock.
Who's there?

52:56.656 --> 52:58.209
George Jefferson!

53:10.048 --> 53:12.741
Well, Weezy,
what do you think?

53:12.879 --> 53:16.779
I think you should pick
door number three.

53:18.781 --> 53:22.440
Oh, George,
you all right?
Of course I'm all right.

53:22.578 --> 53:23.855
What are you two
doing here?

53:23.993 --> 53:25.926
Just visiting, Snoopy.

53:28.377 --> 53:30.310
Are you sure we're
putting this on right?

53:30.448 --> 53:31.898
I think so.

53:33.244 --> 53:36.385
Wait a minute,
Mrs. Jefferson.
This thing is heavy.

53:36.523 --> 53:39.940
Well, I'm gonna
have to carry it.
Let it go, Florence.

53:40.078 --> 53:41.425
All right...

53:58.580 --> 54:00.237
Lord have mercy!

54:05.069 --> 54:06.450
Can I open my
eyes now, George?

54:06.588 --> 54:09.246
If I was you, I would
keep them closed.

54:11.524 --> 54:13.767
Reach!

54:18.703 --> 54:20.947
Oh, my goodness!

54:22.638 --> 54:25.814
It's my boxer shorts
from the Navy. I ain't
seen these in years.

54:25.952 --> 54:27.022
What's that?

54:27.160 --> 54:28.713
Oh, that's my cup.

54:42.417 --> 54:43.866
Your cup?

54:44.004 --> 54:46.697
How in the heck do
you drink out of that?

54:48.492 --> 54:51.736
That Florence. You never
know what she's
gonna say or do.

54:51.874 --> 54:54.118
Like that time
I told her all I wanted
was a good maid.

54:55.361 --> 54:57.742
And you certainly
got one.

54:59.088 --> 55:00.745
Hello, George.

55:00.883 --> 55:02.954
Where's Florence?
She's in her room.

55:03.092 --> 55:04.301
Good...

55:11.618 --> 55:14.345
Good evening,
Master Jefferson, sir.

55:14.483 --> 55:15.898
What are you wearing?

55:16.036 --> 55:19.385
Why, this is my new
maidin' uniform.
I's bought it today, sir.

55:19.523 --> 55:22.008
Why? Are we having
pancakes for dinner?

55:24.631 --> 55:28.497
Oh, that's funny.
You the funniest
man, Mr. Jefferson.

55:28.635 --> 55:30.361
Ain't he funny,
Mrs. Jefferson?

55:30.499 --> 55:33.330
If he were any funnier,
they'd put him away.

55:34.986 --> 55:38.093
Um, um! You give me
them shoes, Master Jefferson.
For what?

55:38.231 --> 55:39.543
They need shining!

55:39.681 --> 55:41.821
Look, Florence...
Now just let me help
you take them off.

55:41.959 --> 55:44.582
Look, Florence, you
don't have to do that.
Oh, I don't mind.

55:44.720 --> 55:47.516
Just lift your little foot.
Look, you ain't supposed to
be shining nobody's shoes.

55:47.654 --> 55:49.311
Why? Don't you think I
can do a good job?

55:49.449 --> 55:51.865
Well, sure you could, but...
Well, then just let me
help you take them off.

55:52.003 --> 55:53.798
Florence, you get
off my shoes.

55:53.936 --> 55:56.663
Oh, Lord, mercy me!
I done made you mad!

56:00.598 --> 56:02.324
Youse disappointed in me.

56:02.462 --> 56:03.808
No, I ain't. I...

56:03.946 --> 56:06.742
I'm sorry, boss!
Florence! Hey!
Stop it, Florence!

56:06.880 --> 56:07.847
Will you get this
woman off me?

56:07.985 --> 56:10.850
Oh, please now,
don't be mad!
Hey!

56:10.988 --> 56:13.093
I'll get it!
I'll get it!

56:14.371 --> 56:16.683
We've had some good
times here, George.

56:16.821 --> 56:21.101
Yeah.
Lionel and Jenny
got married here.

56:21.239 --> 56:24.070
I thought you were
remembering the good times.

56:24.208 --> 56:27.867
Well, it was touch and
go with Lionel before
we got that far.

56:32.216 --> 56:36.531
Oh, look at this guy
with his suitcase. What,
are you moving in, too?

56:36.669 --> 56:39.016
Hell, no. This is
Lionel's suitcase.

56:39.154 --> 56:41.432
I wanna get him out of here
as soon as possible.

56:41.570 --> 56:43.779
If he wants to stay in
a motel, here's the
money to pay for it.

56:43.917 --> 56:45.988
I don't want him asking
for nothing from this house.

56:46.126 --> 56:49.475
If my son wants to run
away, I can afford it.

56:49.613 --> 56:52.305
Don't pay him any attention,
Archie, he's crazy.

56:52.443 --> 56:56.240
What?
He's not going to any
motel. He's staying here!

56:56.378 --> 56:58.691
He ain't gonna shame me
by staying here.

56:58.829 --> 57:02.108
Louise, I think
your husband's right.

57:02.246 --> 57:05.836
George, I want you to
apologize to our son.

57:05.974 --> 57:07.803
We don't have a son,
Louise.

57:07.941 --> 57:12.359
But don't worry. We can
start all over again.
You can give me another boy.

57:12.498 --> 57:14.707
You better call Parcel Post,

57:18.711 --> 57:21.679
'cause I've stopped
making deliveries.

57:24.751 --> 57:26.926
I don't wanna hear this.

57:27.064 --> 57:30.861
Remember Lionel's
graduation day?
Everything went just perfect.

57:30.999 --> 57:33.760
Yeah, he got perfectly drunk.

57:33.898 --> 57:35.728
Drunk? I didn't know that.

57:36.453 --> 57:38.316
I know you didn't.

57:43.908 --> 57:46.566
Well, isn't this nice?
No.

57:48.603 --> 57:50.846
Well, isn't this nice?

57:52.917 --> 57:54.747
Don't you two have
anything else to say?

57:54.885 --> 57:56.714
Oh, sure.

57:56.852 --> 57:59.476
Lionel!
What the heck is
wrong with you?

58:01.029 --> 58:05.274
It is your suit,
Mr. Jefferson. I've fallen
in love with this suit.

58:05.412 --> 58:08.001
The style, the fabric,
the lining.

58:08.139 --> 58:11.004
Oh, the lining is
doing it do death!

58:11.142 --> 58:13.179
You know what
else I think?

58:16.423 --> 58:18.011
You know what else I think?

58:18.149 --> 58:21.187
Do you have to
think so loud?
Well, uh, uh, uh...

58:21.325 --> 58:24.708
I was thinking, Mr.
Jefferson, that I... I have
always admired you.

58:24.846 --> 58:26.330
Uh, uh...

58:26.468 --> 58:29.644
A self-made man
who came up the hard way.
All the way from nothing.

58:29.782 --> 58:32.025
Now you've got five
cleaning stores.
Six.

58:32.163 --> 58:33.510
Six! That's right.

58:33.648 --> 58:36.202
And who knows? Maybe someday
they'll be seven or eight.

58:36.340 --> 58:38.100
But, see the point is,
Mr. Jefferson,

58:38.238 --> 58:41.828
you did it by yourself.
And to think, it started out

58:41.966 --> 58:45.176
in a cotton field in Alabama
46 years ago.
Forty-five.

58:45.314 --> 58:47.006
No!

58:47.144 --> 58:50.596
That's even more remarkable.
To get this far so soon?

58:50.734 --> 58:53.633
Why, you're still a young man,
Mr. Jefferson.

58:53.771 --> 58:56.187
Young looking, too. You know,
if I didn't know you,

58:56.325 --> 59:00.122
I'd never guess
you were old enough to
be Lionel's father.

59:12.272 --> 59:16.242
I know why she's out
of breath, but why are
you breathing so hard?

59:16.863 --> 59:18.865
I can't help myself.

59:19.003 --> 59:21.212
I get carried away
when I'm...

59:21.350 --> 59:23.456
When I'm this
close to you.

59:25.976 --> 59:29.566
And he and Jenny
had their problems
along the way, too.

59:32.534 --> 59:35.364
Jenny, I don't
understand this.
Oh, come on, Mama.

59:35.502 --> 59:38.126
Come on, now. Get down.

59:38.264 --> 59:40.128
Uh, look, Jenny, your mother
told me you were crying

59:40.266 --> 59:42.199
as though your
heart was breaking.

59:42.337 --> 59:46.583
Well, you know how Mama
likes to exaggerate.

59:46.721 --> 59:48.585
Come on, Pop, get down.

59:50.966 --> 59:53.003
Exaggerate?
I did not exaggerate.

59:53.141 --> 59:55.557
Something was going on
between you and Lionel.

59:58.008 --> 1:00:01.149
Yeah, well, uh,
nothing much.

1:00:02.426 --> 1:00:05.912
We had a disagreement,
that's all.
That's all?

1:00:06.050 --> 1:00:09.191
Yeah, but, we came to
an understanding.

1:00:09.329 --> 1:00:11.711
You see, Helen,
there's no problem.

1:00:13.023 --> 1:00:15.094
What kind of understanding?

1:00:19.995 --> 1:00:23.378
Jenny, what kind of
understanding?
The wedding is off.

1:00:26.139 --> 1:00:27.209
What?

1:00:29.384 --> 1:00:32.732
Look, here, Jenny...
Tom, will you stop dancing?

1:00:34.492 --> 1:00:37.426
Do you have any objections
to your daughter marrying
Lionel?

1:00:37.564 --> 1:00:40.015
Of course not.
Lionel's a
fine young man.

1:00:40.153 --> 1:00:42.500
In spite of
his father.

1:00:42.639 --> 1:00:44.192
Well, do you have any
objections to your son

1:00:44.330 --> 1:00:45.952
marrying Jenny?

1:00:46.090 --> 1:00:48.955
It ain't that. It's just
the kind of wedding he's
throwing that I object to.

1:00:49.093 --> 1:00:52.718
Well, that's such a silly
thing to argue about.

1:00:52.856 --> 1:00:55.824
The basic wedding ceremony
is very simple.

1:00:55.962 --> 1:00:57.584
And it's quite beautiful.

1:00:57.723 --> 1:01:00.829
You see, all the minister
has to do is say,

1:01:00.967 --> 1:01:04.315
"Lionel,
do you take Jenny to
be your lawful wedded wife?"

1:01:04.453 --> 1:01:06.524
And then
Lionel would say...

1:01:06.663 --> 1:01:08.423
I do.

1:01:08.561 --> 1:01:11.115
And then he would say,
"Jenny, do you take Lionel

1:01:11.253 --> 1:01:13.221
"to be your lawful
wedded husband?"

1:01:13.359 --> 1:01:14.705
And then Jenny
would say...

1:01:15.602 --> 1:01:16.707
I do.

1:01:17.639 --> 1:01:20.331
You see?
It's all very simple.

1:01:20.469 --> 1:01:25.164
And as long as it's
witnessed by two people,
like those over there,

1:01:26.130 --> 1:01:28.098
then all the minister
has to do is say,

1:01:28.236 --> 1:01:31.929
"By the power
vested in me by
the state of New York,

1:01:32.067 --> 1:01:35.692
"I now pronounce you
man and wife."

1:01:47.496 --> 1:01:50.085
Oh, my baby!

1:01:51.915 --> 1:01:54.193
Weezy, now what's
wrong with you?

1:01:54.987 --> 1:01:57.299
I always cry at weddings.

1:01:57.437 --> 1:01:59.508
If you're crying now,
what you gonna do at
the real wedding?

1:01:59.646 --> 1:02:02.719
George, this is
the real wedding!

1:02:03.478 --> 1:02:04.617
What?

1:02:05.756 --> 1:02:08.725
She's right, George.
Our children are married.

1:02:10.002 --> 1:02:11.313
They're what?

1:02:12.936 --> 1:02:15.386
You mean that was it?

1:02:15.524 --> 1:02:20.219
Lionel, how could you
do this to me?
'Cause I love you, Pop.

1:02:20.357 --> 1:02:23.740
And you know I just didn't
wanna get married without
you being there.

1:02:24.499 --> 1:02:26.397
Married? Without a band?

1:02:28.503 --> 1:02:32.058
And I love my daddy.

1:02:32.196 --> 1:02:34.923
Did you really marry them?
Nope. They married
each other.

1:02:35.061 --> 1:02:36.028
I just performed
the ceremony.

1:02:37.788 --> 1:02:41.274
Oh, George...
Oh, don't cry, Weezy.

1:02:41.412 --> 1:02:44.933
Think of the good side.
What good side?

1:02:45.071 --> 1:02:47.073
We're together.
You and me.

1:02:53.321 --> 1:02:55.150
Weezy, if we ever
get out of this jam,

1:02:55.288 --> 1:02:56.634
there's something I
want you to do.

1:02:56.773 --> 1:02:57.981
What's that?

1:02:58.119 --> 1:02:59.706
Get the tickets
for the ballet.

1:03:00.604 --> 1:03:03.780
You want to see
grown men
on tippy toes?

1:03:05.195 --> 1:03:07.991
No, I just want to say
I'm sorry for some
of the fights we've had.

1:03:08.750 --> 1:03:11.132
Some of them?

1:03:11.270 --> 1:03:13.686
Well, sometimes
you do jump to
the wrong conclusion.

1:03:55.417 --> 1:03:58.144
All right, George,
what have you got
to say for yourself?

1:03:58.282 --> 1:04:00.215
Oh, good morning, love.
Sorry I woke you up.

1:04:00.353 --> 1:04:01.458
Had to get up early.

1:04:14.954 --> 1:04:16.853
It's no good, George.

1:04:16.991 --> 1:04:19.441
I know where you've been
and what you've been doing.

1:04:20.132 --> 1:04:21.271
You do?

1:04:21.409 --> 1:04:23.273
Of course I do.
You think I'm blind?

1:04:23.411 --> 1:04:25.447
Now, take it easy, Weezy.
I can explain everything.

1:04:26.414 --> 1:04:28.485
Try.

1:04:28.623 --> 1:04:31.488
Look, before I go any further,
I want you to know that I've
been doing it for both of us.

1:04:35.802 --> 1:04:37.080
You what?

1:04:37.218 --> 1:04:38.184
And it ain't been easy.

1:04:41.187 --> 1:04:42.188
I'll bet!

1:04:42.326 --> 1:04:43.396
You don't understand.

1:04:43.534 --> 1:04:45.502
I understand everything.

1:04:45.640 --> 1:04:48.332
All those late hours
and mysterious phone calls,

1:04:48.470 --> 1:04:49.886
tired all the time.

1:04:50.024 --> 1:04:51.128
Now, look, honey...

1:04:51.266 --> 1:04:52.889
You save that honey
for your other woman!

1:04:54.166 --> 1:04:55.098
What other woman?

1:04:55.236 --> 1:04:56.858
Don't try to act innocent.

1:04:56.996 --> 1:04:58.895
You've got another woman.

1:04:59.033 --> 1:05:00.034
Another woman?

1:05:00.413 --> 1:05:01.621
Don't deny it.

1:05:01.759 --> 1:05:04.555
You're having a
middle-age fling.

1:05:04.693 --> 1:05:06.972
It happens to lots
of men.

1:05:07.110 --> 1:05:08.076
I can understand that.

1:05:08.766 --> 1:05:09.767
Oh, you can?

1:05:11.286 --> 1:05:12.391
Certainly.

1:05:12.529 --> 1:05:14.772
And I'm mature enough
to take it.

1:05:14.911 --> 1:05:16.257
Oh, you are?

1:05:16.395 --> 1:05:18.638
Well, in that case,
you're right.

1:05:18.776 --> 1:05:19.777
It is another woman.

1:05:28.959 --> 1:05:31.203
And sometimes you don't
figure out what's happened

1:05:31.341 --> 1:05:33.274
until it's nearly too late.

1:05:33.895 --> 1:05:34.931
Huh?

1:05:35.069 --> 1:05:37.347
Remember your old Navy buddy?

1:05:45.665 --> 1:05:48.841
Now, let's get
something straight,
Wendell.

1:05:48.979 --> 1:05:50.981
You'd better keep
away from me.

1:05:51.119 --> 1:05:53.811
Hey, Louise...
Don't you
"Hey, Louise" me.

1:05:53.950 --> 1:05:56.124
You're supposed to be
George's best friend.

1:05:56.262 --> 1:05:59.507
Where do you get off
making passes at me,
and right under his nose, too?

1:05:59.645 --> 1:06:00.957
Hey, easy, Mama!

1:06:01.095 --> 1:06:03.476
The only reason I haven't
said anything earlier

1:06:03.614 --> 1:06:05.547
is because I didn't wanna
hurt George's feelings.

1:06:05.685 --> 1:06:08.585
But if you put your hand on me
one more time,

1:06:08.723 --> 1:06:10.828
you're gonna
draw back a nub!

1:06:17.974 --> 1:06:22.185
Oh, no, no,
you got me wrong.
I ain't gonna use my hands.

1:06:22.323 --> 1:06:23.669
Look? Look?

1:06:27.500 --> 1:06:30.538
Whoo-whee!

1:06:33.575 --> 1:06:36.613
I like a woman with
a little fire.

1:06:36.751 --> 1:06:40.341
Now I'm warning you, Wendell,
you take one more step
and I'll let loose

1:06:40.479 --> 1:06:42.757
with the loudest scream
you ever heard!

1:06:42.895 --> 1:06:47.727
Hey, that sounds groovy.
Because we both understand
that a no means yes!

1:06:48.728 --> 1:06:50.696
Not in this house
it don't!

1:06:59.256 --> 1:07:03.088
Yeah. Wendell was hitting
on you, and Mama
was hitting on him.

1:07:04.054 --> 1:07:06.746
Yeah, that was
quite a night.

1:07:06.884 --> 1:07:09.646
You know something, Weezy?
Maybe you never noticed this,

1:07:09.784 --> 1:07:11.613
but sometimes I don't
appreciate you enough.

1:07:15.824 --> 1:07:17.378
Really?

1:07:20.346 --> 1:07:21.554
How many years have
you known Mom?

1:07:21.692 --> 1:07:24.385
I don't know.
Twenty-five, 26...

1:07:24.523 --> 1:07:26.042
What does it
matter now?

1:07:26.180 --> 1:07:28.078
It's all dirty water
under the bridge.

1:07:28.216 --> 1:07:30.529
And how many times
has she lied to you?

1:07:30.667 --> 1:07:33.394
Weezy never lied to me.
You see?

1:07:33.532 --> 1:07:37.018
She just never
told me things she
didn't want me to know.

1:07:37.639 --> 1:07:38.847
You know she loves you.

1:07:38.985 --> 1:07:40.539
What's that got to
do with it?

1:07:40.677 --> 1:07:42.299
Louise loves everybody.

1:07:42.437 --> 1:07:45.268
A-ha!
Look, don't you
a-ha me.

1:07:45.406 --> 1:07:48.443
There've been enough
a-ha's for one day.

1:07:48.581 --> 1:07:52.102
Pop, remember when any of
the old neighbors in Harlem
used to get sick?

1:07:52.240 --> 1:07:54.484
Who was it who always
looked after them?
Your mother.

1:07:54.622 --> 1:07:57.176
That's another one
of Weezy's faults.
Always helping people.

1:07:57.314 --> 1:07:59.592
And stray cats and dogs.
Yeah, and stray cats.

1:07:59.730 --> 1:08:01.663
Always petting them,
and hugging them,
and picking them up.

1:08:01.801 --> 1:08:04.390
And feeding them better
than she feeds me.

1:08:04.528 --> 1:08:07.945
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Mom is, um...

1:08:08.084 --> 1:08:09.637
Too sentimental.
Mmm-hmm.

1:08:09.775 --> 1:08:12.398
She'd hug an rhinoceros
if it was lost.

1:08:16.126 --> 1:08:18.784
There's something I wanna say.
Yes, I wanna say something
to you, too.

1:08:18.922 --> 1:08:22.063
Would you let me say
my say first?
Uh, sorry, George.

1:08:22.201 --> 1:08:27.033
Well, when I went
out of here before,
I went over to Mama's.

1:08:27.172 --> 1:08:28.863
You went crying
to your mother?

1:08:29.001 --> 1:08:31.314
I didn't go crying,
I went mad!

1:08:31.452 --> 1:08:34.903
Oh, I thought it was
the wife who was always
supposed to run away to Mama.

1:08:35.041 --> 1:08:37.803
Will you cut it out
before I get mad again?

1:08:39.667 --> 1:08:42.497
Anyway, she told me
something about you.

1:08:42.635 --> 1:08:44.499
Oh, I bet she did.

1:08:44.637 --> 1:08:48.296
No, I mean
something nice.
Oh.

1:08:48.434 --> 1:08:51.092
She knew you were jiving
this morning about us going
out with the Hendrickses.

1:08:51.230 --> 1:08:54.268
She did?
Mmm-hmm. She read it
in your face.

1:08:54.406 --> 1:08:56.511
So I got to
thinking.

1:08:56.649 --> 1:08:59.342
No matter how much
you wanted us to
be alone together,

1:08:59.480 --> 1:09:01.689
you had trouble
making up that story.

1:09:01.827 --> 1:09:05.417
That's right. That's like
what I wanted to tell you,
George. You see...

1:09:05.555 --> 1:09:07.212
Will you hush up?

1:09:09.973 --> 1:09:12.527
Anyhow, I can
see it plain now.

1:09:13.804 --> 1:09:15.323
If you can't lie
for yourself,

1:09:15.461 --> 1:09:17.636
then I had no business
asking you to lie for me.

1:09:17.774 --> 1:09:19.189
Thank you, George.

1:09:20.190 --> 1:09:21.674
Now what you
got to say?

1:09:21.812 --> 1:09:24.608
Oh, it doesn't matter. I
think you nearly said it.

1:09:25.161 --> 1:09:26.748
Good.

1:09:26.886 --> 1:09:30.476
See your trouble, Weezy,
is you were born honest.
You know?

1:09:33.272 --> 1:09:36.137
I guess that's one of
the reasons I feel
about you the way I do.

1:09:36.275 --> 1:09:38.553
Oh? What way is that,
George?

1:09:40.037 --> 1:09:42.419
Well, you know,
I told you before.

1:09:43.903 --> 1:09:45.802
What did you
tell me before?

1:09:45.940 --> 1:09:47.873
You know,
something nice.

1:09:49.426 --> 1:09:51.221
You mean that
I'm beautiful?

1:09:51.359 --> 1:09:52.326
No.

1:09:55.536 --> 1:09:57.883
You mean
I'm not beautiful?

1:09:58.021 --> 1:09:59.022
No, I didn't say that.

1:09:59.160 --> 1:10:01.335
Well, you better
say something.

1:10:02.715 --> 1:10:03.958
All right.

1:10:05.649 --> 1:10:06.995
I love you.

1:10:07.651 --> 1:10:08.583
I love you.

1:10:08.721 --> 1:10:10.206
Oh, George...

1:10:14.175 --> 1:10:17.420
Oh, I love you, too.
Happy anniversary.

1:10:17.558 --> 1:10:19.974
Happy anniversary, Weezy.
You're a good woman.

1:10:20.112 --> 1:10:21.493
A very good woman.

1:10:21.631 --> 1:10:22.597
You know,

1:10:22.735 --> 1:10:24.565
you really deserve me.

1:10:36.956 --> 1:10:38.613
I think I heard him
coming back.

1:10:38.751 --> 1:10:40.512
Can you hear him?
No.

1:10:40.650 --> 1:10:42.479
Look, I don't care
what that turkey steals
out there, Weezy.

1:10:42.617 --> 1:10:44.550
As long as he
don't hurt you.

1:10:44.688 --> 1:10:46.518
Oh, George.

1:10:46.656 --> 1:10:48.416
I don't think I could
live without you, Weez.

1:10:49.935 --> 1:10:50.901
He's coming for us!

1:10:51.039 --> 1:10:52.420
Don't panic, Weezy.
I'll get him.

1:10:52.558 --> 1:10:55.872
I ain't cleaning up
after no wild party.
Oh...

1:10:56.010 --> 1:10:58.599
That place looks like
it's been looted.

1:11:02.603 --> 1:11:05.191
Florence, quick, untie us!

1:11:05.330 --> 1:11:06.710
I never thought
the day would come

1:11:06.848 --> 1:11:08.505
when I'd be glad
to see you.

1:11:08.643 --> 1:11:09.679
Is he still out there?

1:11:09.817 --> 1:11:11.267
Who?
The burglar!

1:11:11.405 --> 1:11:12.716
What burglar?

1:11:12.854 --> 1:11:14.304
The front door's wide open,

1:11:14.442 --> 1:11:17.134
and there ain't nothing
out there but a big mess.

1:11:17.273 --> 1:11:19.136
Thank God he's gone.

1:11:19.275 --> 1:11:20.690
What happened?
Who did it?

1:11:20.828 --> 1:11:22.243
How did he get in?
What did he look like?

1:11:22.381 --> 1:11:26.143
How come your hands
don't work as fast
as your mouth?

1:11:26.282 --> 1:11:29.526
We don't know who it
was, but thank God you
came back.

1:11:30.493 --> 1:11:32.943
Oh, how... Why did you
come back so soon?

1:11:33.081 --> 1:11:34.635
What happened to
your date?

1:11:34.773 --> 1:11:37.603
That ugly, no-account
turkey didn't show up.

1:11:38.328 --> 1:11:40.226
You said he was smart.

1:11:42.677 --> 1:11:44.852
I think I'll untie
you first.

1:11:46.854 --> 1:11:48.821
How long you
been like this?

1:11:48.959 --> 1:11:50.133
Oh, I don't know.

1:11:50.271 --> 1:11:52.066
It seems like hours.

1:11:54.171 --> 1:11:55.794
Just you and him?

1:11:57.105 --> 1:11:58.624
You poor woman.

1:11:59.832 --> 1:12:01.800
What did you do
all that time?

1:12:01.938 --> 1:12:03.422
Oh, we talked.

1:12:03.560 --> 1:12:05.459
Talked?
About what?

1:12:05.597 --> 1:12:07.909
Oh, Florence,
it was beautiful.

1:12:08.047 --> 1:12:10.084
I was scared to
death tonight,

1:12:10.222 --> 1:12:11.913
but I'll always cherish...

1:12:12.051 --> 1:12:14.778
It ain't none of your
damn business
what we talked about!

1:12:14.916 --> 1:12:16.987
I was trying to get us loose
so I could catch that crook.

1:12:17.125 --> 1:12:18.989
What we talked about
don't matter.

1:12:19.127 --> 1:12:20.991
Mr. Jefferson's right.

1:12:21.129 --> 1:12:23.235
We were pretty busy.

1:12:23.373 --> 1:12:27.929
That's why I guess I
can't remember anything
we talked about.

1:12:33.107 --> 1:12:35.523
Well, don't just
stand there, untie me!

1:12:36.352 --> 1:12:37.353
What?

1:12:39.355 --> 1:12:42.358
Hey, Weezy, where you going?
Hey, wait a minute.

1:12:43.738 --> 1:12:45.740
I gotta go to the bathroom!

1:13:10.524 --> 1:13:11.490
Movin', movin'...

1:13:12.871 --> 1:13:14.873
We movin' on up

1:13:17.807 --> 1:13:20.603
To the East Side
