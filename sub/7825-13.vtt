to rescue the boy.

10:42.720 --> 10:45.530
By God, men,
you're a bunch of
marshmallows.

10:45.590 --> 10:46.930
Why don't
you go, Chief?

10:46.990 --> 10:47.900
Well, I'm too f...

10:47.960 --> 10:49.300
...important.

10:49.360 --> 10:51.470
Although the well
is too dark to see the boy,

10:51.530 --> 10:52.630
Timmy has told us

10:52.700 --> 10:54.970
his foot is trapped
under a rock.

10:55.030 --> 10:59.000
Thus any attempt to pull him up
would snap him like a twig.

10:59.070 --> 11:00.440
In desperation,
the city is considering

11:00.510 --> 11:02.140
more unorthodox solutions.

11:02.210 --> 11:04.680
Grasping the child
firmly in his talons

11:04.740 --> 11:06.970
Socrates here will
fly him to safety.

11:07.050 --> 11:08.250
Just watch.

11:14.150 --> 11:16.650
I don't think
he's coming back.

11:16.720 --> 11:19.330
With this hook
and this hunk of chocolate

11:19.390 --> 11:20.930
I'll land your boy

11:20.990 --> 11:22.820
and I'll clean him for free.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.960
Although we can't reach the boy

11:25.030 --> 11:27.440
we can freeze him
with liquid nitrogen

11:27.500 --> 11:30.200
so that future generations
can rescue him.

11:30.270 --> 11:34.380
Dear Lord, before we peel
the foil back from your bounty

11:34.440 --> 11:37.750
we ask you to watch over
little Timmy O'Toole

11:37.810 --> 11:39.480
trapped in that well.

11:39.540 --> 11:41.810
( <i>Bart laughing loudly )</i>

11:41.880 --> 11:43.950
Bart, what's wrong with you?

11:44.020 --> 11:45.720
Yeah, that Timmy is
a real hero.

11:45.780 --> 11:47.280
How do you mean, Dad?

11:47.350 --> 11:51.030
Well, he fell down a well
and can't get out.

11:51.090 --> 11:52.860
How does that
make him a hero?

11:52.920 --> 11:54.750
Well, it's more
than you did.

11:54.830 --> 11:56.930
And finally, Channel 6's own
Krusty the Clown

11:57.000 --> 11:59.670
has gathered members of
the entertainment community--

11:59.730 --> 12:02.100
who normally steer clear
of fashionable causes--

12:02.170 --> 12:03.240
for a video called

12:03.300 --> 12:06.470
"We're Sending Our Love
Down the Well."

12:06.540 --> 12:08.010
I wanted to do something

12:08.070 --> 12:09.030
to help that boy.

12:09.110 --> 12:10.580
so I called my
good friend, Sting.

12:10.640 --> 12:11.750
He said

12:11.810 --> 12:13.280
"Krusty, when do you
need me?"

12:13.350 --> 12:14.720
I said, "Thursday."

12:14.780 --> 12:16.250
He said, "I'm busy Thursday."

12:16.310 --> 12:17.710
I said,
"What about Friday?"

12:17.780 --> 12:18.880
He said

12:18.950 --> 12:20.250
"Friday's worse
than Thursday."

12:20.320 --> 12:22.190
Then <i>he said,
"how about Saturday?"</i>

12:22.250 --> 12:23.180
I said

12:23.250 --> 12:24.250
"fine."

12:24.320 --> 12:25.450
True story.

12:25.520 --> 12:28.320
Yeah. I used to open
for Krusty in '69.

12:28.390 --> 12:32.520
In fact, he fired me
as I recall.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.130
Oh, Sting.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.270
But this isn't

Gentlemen, this canary
died of natural causes.

20:50.980 --> 20:52.820
Back in the hole!

20:52.880 --> 20:53.880
( <i>screaming )</i>

20:53.950 --> 20:56.590
( <i>panting )</i>

20:56.650 --> 20:58.160
Sting, you look tired.

20:58.220 --> 21:00.490
Maybe you should
take a rest.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.030
Not while one of my
fans needs me.

21:03.090 --> 21:06.300
Actually, I don't know
if I've ever heard Bart
play one of your albums.

21:06.360 --> 21:09.130
Shh! Marge,
he's a good digger.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.440
( <i>panting )</i>

21:11.500 --> 21:12.770
Uhh!

21:12.830 --> 21:14.760
Sting!

21:14.840 --> 21:15.770
Mom!

21:15.840 --> 21:17.270
Dad!

21:17.340 --> 21:19.640
Bart, I've missed you
so much.

21:21.340 --> 21:23.200
Man, I was
so scared.

21:23.280 --> 21:24.380
Don't worry, son.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.620
They're going to make sure

21:26.680 --> 21:29.720
no one ever falls down
this well again.

21:29.780 --> 21:32.450
( <i>grunting )</i>

21:32.520 --> 21:35.390
That should do it.
