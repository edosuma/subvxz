00:06.360 --> 00:09.360
Five minutes in the air,
eye contact with the terrorist.

00:32.680 --> 00:35.240
What happened?
Is this your only injury?

00:36.800 --> 00:39.160
The bastard fucked up my leg.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.400
Can you breathe?

00:40.480 --> 00:43.800
That son of a bitch
fucked up my career.

00:43.880 --> 00:45.960
-Everything's okay.
-No it's not, Moreno.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.520
-He needs to be rushed to the O.R.
-Get a stretcher!

00:49.640 --> 00:50.640
I'm fine.

00:51.320 --> 00:53.360
He needs to be evacuated right now.

00:53.440 --> 00:55.920
I'm fine.
Moreno, give me some gum.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.600
-What's up?
-Everything's fine.

00:57.680 --> 00:59.440
-Where was he hit?
-Right... there.

00:59.520 --> 01:00.920
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

01:01.040 --> 01:03.680
-Where did it hit?
-Same place as last time.

01:03.880 --> 01:06.080
Moreno, we need
to go back right now.

01:06.520 --> 01:08.560
Go to the hospital
and then go home.

01:08.640 --> 01:09.680
What?!

01:10.000 --> 01:12.720
You've done your duty, Doron.
Go home.

01:12.960 --> 01:13.960
For fuck's sake!

01:25.880 --> 01:28.280
Were you guys shot?
You're coming with me.

01:28.360 --> 01:31.120
Steve, return the vehicle
to the unit. Let's go.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.240
[ARABIC]
[Will he be okay?]

03:02.640 --> 03:04.840
[We'll only know
when we operate on him.]

03:08.520 --> 03:11.800
[What are you doing?
He needs to be rushed to the O.R.]

03:12.480 --> 03:14.480
[Do it here.
He mustn't leave this room.]

03:14.560 --> 03:16.640
[Does this look
like an O.R. to you?]

03:17.160 --> 03:18.840
[You're risking his life.]

03:20.920 --> 03:23.680
[It's the Panther.
He'll live.]

04:21.000 --> 04:23.040
It's stronger than me, Gali.

04:28.280 --> 04:31.120
<i>[May God keep me</i>
<i>from the evil Satan,]</i>

04:31.520 --> 04:34.800
<i>[in the name</i>
<i>of the all merciful Allah...]</i>

04:36.560 --> 04:41.160
[My dear son,
my heart is broken over you.]

04:43.360 --> 04:46.960
[Say hello to your father,
my son.]

05:08.560 --> 05:10.680
[-My condolences.]
[-Thank you.]

05:24.800 --> 05:28.480
[They broke my heart...]

05:48.920 --> 05:52.400
[What are you doing?
He won't be able to breathe.]

05:57.880 --> 05:59.600
[We need to take him.]

06:00.040 --> 06:03.240
[Come back in about an hour.]

06:07.000 --> 06:11.560
[Whatever you need,
just tell us. Okay?]

06:16.360 --> 06:20.920
[Don't take him,
leave my son with me...]

06:27.160 --> 06:29.120
SAINT BERNARD

06:33.600 --> 06:35.720
SAINT BERNARD

07:43.960 --> 07:47.280
-I was worried about you.
-What's there to worry about?

07:47.600 --> 07:49.560
I don't know,
you tell me.

07:50.720 --> 07:54.440
The most dangerous thing
in my life is you.

08:02.160 --> 08:05.480
Listen, we bet 50 shekels
that you'd take off your shirt.

08:05.640 --> 08:08.480
Cool it, bro.

08:08.560 --> 08:11.560
Up yours, faggot.
What're you gonna do about it?

08:12.000 --> 08:13.360
Huh, fucker?

08:13.600 --> 08:15.120
Boaz, cut it out!

08:16.680 --> 08:18.760
Boaz, that's enough.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.240
Moron!

08:34.680 --> 08:37.920
Hold on, bro. You'll need this
stamp to get back inside.

09:08.160 --> 09:13.040
RAFIDIA HOSPITAL
NABLUS

09:14.000 --> 09:17.440
[The bullet went in and out.
He was lucky. No bones were broken.]

09:17.560 --> 09:19.640
[The problem is,
he lost a lot of blood.]

09:19.800 --> 09:23.160
[-He needs more surgeries, right?]
[-Not necessarily.]

09:23.320 --> 09:26.440
[Good. Because we need
to get him out of hospital today.]

09:26.520 --> 09:29.360
[You don't understand.
If he leaves today, he dies.]

09:29.440 --> 09:31.520
[He needs antibiotics,
a blood transfusion...]

09:31.600 --> 09:33.400
[Not to mention rehabilitation.]

09:33.480 --> 09:35.200
[If he doesn't
leave here soon,]

09:35.280 --> 09:37.520
[there won't be anyone
to rehabilitate.]

09:37.600 --> 09:41.240
[If he leaves hospital at this state,
you've done their work for them.]

09:43.560 --> 09:47.000
[Okay, so stay with him and
take care of him, but not here.]

09:47.080 --> 09:50.040
[-We'll arrange everything.]
[-He needs to be hospitalized]

09:50.120 --> 09:51.920
[for at least another week.]

09:52.080 --> 09:55.080
[Excuse me,
I need to see some patients.]

10:07.280 --> 10:08.520
Pretty.

10:09.440 --> 10:10.960
Real pretty.

10:12.040 --> 10:16.720
-What is it?
-It's the Kabbalah symbol of life.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.480
Kabbalah is your thing, ah?

10:37.240 --> 10:40.760
-What are you doing tomorrow?
-Staying put.

10:43.760 --> 10:46.360
How about we travel
to Berlin tomorrow?

10:49.120 --> 10:51.680
Sounds awesome, but I can't.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.960
-Why not?
-I've got work to do.

10:55.040 --> 10:58.120
-Call in sick.
-It doesn't work that way.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.560
What do you mean?

11:03.640 --> 11:05.320
Where do you work?

11:08.440 --> 11:10.160
At the Ministry of Defense.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.760
What do you do
at the Ministry of Defense?

11:20.360 --> 11:22.800
You're not getting your chain back
till you tell me.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.160
-No?
-No.

11:24.720 --> 11:27.280
Well, I work with lots of Arabs.

11:27.480 --> 11:29.680
-You speak Arabic?
-Yes.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.520
Say something.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.360
What does it mean?

11:43.760 --> 11:47.120
It's like, anything I saw
before seeing you,

11:47.200 --> 11:50.360
was a waste of a life,
sort of.

11:50.440 --> 11:51.640
Nice.

11:58.520 --> 12:00.480
[Sheikh Awdallah is here.]

12:00.960 --> 12:02.360
Come in, Sheikh.

12:07.120 --> 12:08.600
[Peace be upon you.]

12:16.760 --> 12:18.280
[The <i>Fatih</i>a, everyone.]

12:24.920 --> 12:26.480
["Guide us on the straight path]

12:26.560 --> 12:29.360
[of the prophets and not
of those who stray." Amen.]

12:31.040 --> 12:35.240
["Think not of the martyrs
as being dead,]

12:35.320 --> 12:38.440
[for they live on to serve God."]

12:38.760 --> 12:40.640
[God's justice is almighty.]

12:40.760 --> 12:44.040
[God will have mercy on him and
give you strength and patience, Haja.]

12:46.720 --> 12:50.360
[Child, did you see how many
people came to the funeral?]

12:50.440 --> 12:54.240
[They want to pay their respects to
the Shahid and to you, as his wife.]

12:55.000 --> 12:57.600
[I don't want to be
a Shahid's wife.]

12:58.600 --> 13:00.360
[I don't want to go on living.]

13:00.440 --> 13:02.560
[God forbid.]

13:02.640 --> 13:05.280
[The Prophet, may he rest in peace,
commanded women]

13:05.360 --> 13:07.280
[to fulfil the obligation of Jihad]

13:07.360 --> 13:09.840
[by having children,]

13:09.920 --> 13:12.920
[indoctrinating them and
keeping the sanctity of the home.]

13:13.000 --> 13:16.640
[Your Jihad, my child,
is to raise a family.]

13:17.120 --> 13:20.040
[I will no longer
be raising a family.]

13:20.720 --> 13:23.040
[In any case,]

13:23.400 --> 13:25.360
[you'll feel better with time.]

13:25.440 --> 13:28.000
[Time is wiser than all of us.]

13:28.120 --> 13:31.480
[You're a young girl, and God willing,
you'll get married and have children.]

13:31.560 --> 13:33.600
[No! I won't.]

13:35.800 --> 13:37.320
[You can take him.]

13:37.880 --> 13:41.480
[Amal, my child,
believe in Allah,]

13:41.560 --> 13:43.560
[and don't be irresponsible!]

13:43.680 --> 13:48.840
[Don't worry, I know exactly
what path Allah has chosen for me.]

14:12.440 --> 14:15.000
[How did it happen?]

14:15.760 --> 14:20.920
[I can tell you, but you mustn't
share it with anyone, okay?]

14:21.200 --> 14:23.560
[Of course,
it's medical confidentiality.]

14:23.800 --> 14:26.800
[-Just between us, right?]
[-Sure, don't worry.]

14:26.880 --> 14:28.360
I'm Spiderman.

14:28.640 --> 14:30.240
[You're what?]

14:30.480 --> 14:32.160
[Don't you dare
blow my cover!]

14:33.400 --> 14:34.680
[Brother!]

14:39.120 --> 14:41.120
[-This is my brother.]
-Nice to meet you, I'm Ali.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.960
[Tell him I'm Spiderman.]

14:43.120 --> 14:44.680
[He doesn't believe me.]

14:44.760 --> 14:45.920
How's he doing?

14:46.000 --> 14:48.680
Fine, he's just a little goofy
from the morphine.

14:48.880 --> 14:51.480
Just let him rest.
He'll get over it soon.

14:51.560 --> 14:52.520
Great, thanks.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.600
[-He's a good Arab...]
-I'm Ali.

14:54.680 --> 14:56.880
-Nice to meet you.
[-Good Arab.]

14:57.240 --> 15:00.560
-Take care, Eli.
-Eli, that was rude.

15:00.880 --> 15:02.160
Thanks.

15:08.360 --> 15:11.920
[How's it going, buddy?]
You okay?

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
-Am I okay? They cut off my leg.
-No, they didn't.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.920
-I can't feel it.
-Because you're high on morphine.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.480
There's your leg, see?

15:24.600 --> 15:25.840
Bro...

15:27.200 --> 15:30.600
-I wanted to ask your forgiveness.
-About what?

15:30.760 --> 15:32.360
What do you think?

15:32.440 --> 15:35.920
Are you kidding?
I should be thanking you.

15:36.280 --> 15:39.840
We'll talk about this
when you're not stoned.

15:39.960 --> 15:43.120
Thanks to you, I realized
what I need to do with my life.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.720
Thanks to you,
I'm leaving the unit.

15:48.160 --> 15:51.240
What are you talking about, bro?
You'll march right back.

15:51.360 --> 15:54.080
Allah sent me this bullet
sealed with a kiss.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.120
It's my chance
to get out of this crap.

15:57.880 --> 16:01.920
That's what you think now.
But you'll miss it soon enough.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.760
No way,
I'm not like you.

16:05.880 --> 16:09.960
I'll be a normal citizen
and start living.

17:01.440 --> 17:05.040
[-The tea is sweet.]
[-I added some sugar.]

17:08.760 --> 17:12.480
[From a young age I knew
Bashir and I would get married.]

17:14.560 --> 17:17.120
[Anyone who saw us playing
could see it.]

17:17.200 --> 17:19.160
[My family, his family.]

17:19.760 --> 17:24.600
[-Only he didn't know.]
[-They're always the last to know.]

17:26.400 --> 17:28.640
[We wanted to travel
to London.]

17:29.720 --> 17:32.520
[I was supposed to study
international relations,]

17:32.600 --> 17:35.120
[he wanted to work in diamonds.]

17:36.560 --> 17:38.280
[Shattered dreams.]

17:38.920 --> 17:43.640
[And look at us now.
Two widows, fellow sufferers.]

17:45.920 --> 17:47.520
[How dare you?]

17:49.360 --> 17:53.600
[Keep lying all you want about your
husband, but don't say we're alike.]

17:54.040 --> 17:58.240
[-What are you talking about, Amal?]
[-I know your husband is alive.]

18:00.080 --> 18:03.640
[-Darling, I know you're hurting, but--]
[-I'm no fool.]

18:04.360 --> 18:06.880
[I know he's alive
and I want to speak with him.]

18:07.720 --> 18:12.520
[Darling, Abu Ahmad is dead.
Thousands attended his funeral, even you.]

18:12.600 --> 18:15.800
[Listen to me, Um Ahmad,
"the widow",]

18:15.880 --> 18:18.240
[I want to speak
with Abu Ahmad!]

18:22.440 --> 18:25.880
[How is your eldest son planning
to take revenge for his little brother?]

18:27.000 --> 18:31.480
[Darling, you know that Abu Ahmad
died more than a year ago.]

18:33.880 --> 18:35.400
[I know he's alive.]

18:35.480 --> 18:38.120
[Just the other day
he gave Bashir this money.]

18:38.640 --> 18:41.680
[-You're wrong.]
[-No, I'm not. I saw it in his eyes.]

18:41.760 --> 18:44.320
[He wanted to tell me that
his brother gave him the cash]

18:44.400 --> 18:46.960
[but at the wedding, the Jews
came looking for Abu Ahmad]

18:47.040 --> 18:48.600
[and when they couldn't find him,
they killed Bashir.]

18:48.680 --> 18:52.480
[I don't know where he got
this money! I don't know.]

18:52.560 --> 18:56.440
[You're like a mother to me,
don't lie to me like I'm a fool!]

18:56.520 --> 19:00.000
[Amal! Calm down. Sit.]

19:00.480 --> 19:04.000
[I must know if Abu Ahmad is planning
a revenge or if I have to do it.]

19:04.280 --> 19:05.560
[My dear...]

19:07.080 --> 19:12.440
[Don't get into this,
stay out of these things.]

19:14.160 --> 19:17.320
[If I mean anything to you,
tell him to talk to me.]

19:17.720 --> 19:21.040
[Amal, darling,
Abu Ahmad is dead.]

19:21.120 --> 19:24.040
[This family has suffered enough death.
Don't do something foolish]

19:24.120 --> 19:26.680
[that you'll end up regretting.
You're still young.]

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
[I'd never agree to live like you,
hardly ever seeing my husband.]

19:32.720 --> 19:34.920
[You're wasting
your lives.]

20:18.280 --> 20:19.680
[-Hello.]
[-Hi.]

20:19.760 --> 20:23.400
[-I have a meeting with Walid Al-Abed.]
[-Come in.]

20:26.480 --> 20:27.760
[Thank you.]

20:38.280 --> 20:40.920
[Hi.
My condolences.]

20:41.000 --> 20:42.480
[Let's talk there.]

20:44.520 --> 20:46.160
[Anything to drink?]

20:51.400 --> 20:52.840
[Lemon juice.]

20:53.800 --> 20:55.240
[There you go.]

20:57.000 --> 20:58.480
[Tell me,
where's the Panther?]

20:58.560 --> 21:02.240
[Abu Ahmad is dead, as you know.
But talk to me, I'll help you.]

21:02.320 --> 21:05.560
[-There isn't much to talk about.]
[-But you called me.]

21:05.640 --> 21:08.000
[You deserve compensation.
I'll make sure you get it.]

21:08.080 --> 21:09.280
[I don't want money.]

21:09.760 --> 21:11.520
[I want revenge.]

21:13.680 --> 21:15.600
[I want to be a Shahid.]

21:16.880 --> 21:19.440
[I understand you're talking
out of pain,]

21:19.800 --> 21:22.720
[but now you must keep
a clear mind and your composure.]

21:22.800 --> 21:25.680
[I know Abu Ahmad wants
to avenge Bashir's death.]

21:25.760 --> 21:27.800
[Forget Abu Ahmad
and forget revenge.]

21:27.880 --> 21:29.320
[It doesn't work that way.]

21:29.400 --> 21:32.320
[If you deny me, I'll turn to <i>Saray</i>a
<i>(Islamic Jihad)</i>.]

21:32.400 --> 21:33.920
[I'm sure they'll agree.]

21:34.000 --> 21:36.480
[They'd never collaborate
with the Panther's widow.]

21:36.560 --> 21:38.120
[Don't be so sure.]

21:38.360 --> 21:40.800
[Do you know what an explosive belt
does to the body?]

21:41.040 --> 21:42.800
[It blows you up
into a million pieces.]

21:42.880 --> 21:45.960
[Listen, kid,
I don't know who you are.]

21:46.040 --> 21:48.280
[Tell Abu Ahmad
that if he doesn't send me,]

21:48.360 --> 21:52.600
[I'll take a knife, go to a checkpoint
and stab as many soldiers as I can.]

21:52.880 --> 21:55.920
[-Amal, listen...]
[-Enough, you're no help to me.]

21:56.000 --> 21:58.400
[Amal, please
don't speak to anyone!]

21:58.480 --> 22:01.360
[Don't speak to anyone.
I'll see what I can do.]

22:10.320 --> 22:12.440
[What are you both looking at?]

23:32.240 --> 23:34.520
[Easy now. I'll help you.]

23:41.480 --> 23:43.920
[Feeling better now?]

23:44.400 --> 23:46.400
[Something sweet... chocolate.]

23:46.600 --> 23:49.480
[I can't. Sorry.]

23:49.600 --> 23:53.240
[You're not allowed to have anything,
you just had surgery.]

23:54.360 --> 23:56.520
[You can wet your lips a bit.]

23:56.800 --> 23:59.120
[Just a bite of chocolate.]

24:01.280 --> 24:03.160
[Okay, one piece.]

24:07.360 --> 24:10.120
[Slowly.]

24:28.200 --> 24:30.320
[Was someone hurt
at the wedding?]

24:30.400 --> 24:34.160
[-My mom, the kids, Nassrin?]
[-No, they're fine.]

24:35.440 --> 24:37.040
[Then what is it?]

24:38.000 --> 24:39.400
[Talk!]

24:39.480 --> 24:41.480
[Special forces entered
that house.]

24:41.560 --> 24:44.040
[Amjad and Abu Khalil
tried to stop them.]

24:44.360 --> 24:46.960
[They killed Amjad,
may God have mercy on his soul.]

24:50.080 --> 24:52.360
[Then Bashir tried to stop them...]

24:53.760 --> 24:55.560
[...and he got shot.]

24:56.400 --> 24:58.840
[He died a Shahid.]

25:03.280 --> 25:05.240
[May God
have mercy on his soul.]

25:10.520 --> 25:14.480
[Shouldn't we be happy
that Bashir died as a Shahid?]

25:36.560 --> 25:40.520
-It's Saturday night. Get a life.
-What time is it?

25:42.160 --> 25:44.560
Come on,
you got an A from me.

25:50.160 --> 25:52.720
Forget it,
you'll never go out on field.

25:53.240 --> 25:54.240
We'll see.

25:56.840 --> 25:59.920
Moreno, I need two minutes
of your time.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
Yep.

26:13.920 --> 26:17.320
-Cigarette?
-No, I quit 18 months ago.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.640
Why did you tell me
to go home?

26:21.280 --> 26:24.520
-Doron, come on...
-I must finish him.

26:25.280 --> 26:26.760
You're not going back.

26:27.640 --> 26:30.040
I asked you to return,
you did, end of story.

26:30.120 --> 26:32.880
Moreno, I can't sleep.
My entire body is itching.

26:34.800 --> 26:37.160
You bastard, you knew
this would happen.

26:37.240 --> 26:41.560
Whether I knew it or not, desire
and ability are two separate things.

26:41.640 --> 26:42.480
Meaning?

26:42.600 --> 26:45.800
You violated Eli's order
to leave the wedding.

26:45.880 --> 26:48.720
Then, sorry to tell you,
but you panicked.

26:48.880 --> 26:52.000
Why did you attack Abu Khalef
after Eli pulled you out?

26:53.600 --> 26:56.480
It was my mistake
to get you involved again.

26:56.880 --> 27:00.440
Are you manipulating me?
You think I'm a kid?

27:01.480 --> 27:04.040
I was happy at home
before you showed up.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.280
Okay.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.120
You catch Abu Ahmad
and return home.

27:09.880 --> 27:13.680
No questions asked,
no independent decisions, no excuses.

27:13.760 --> 27:17.760
It's not like it used to be.
Now you do as we say.

27:18.320 --> 27:20.360
-Doron...
-Okay.

27:20.520 --> 27:24.960
-Do as we say.
-Whatever you say.

27:25.360 --> 27:26.720
Besides...

27:27.880 --> 27:30.720
You joined in because
you're not happy at home.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.520
At this hour?

28:00.280 --> 28:03.040
Gali, I have some stuff to do,
I'll be right there.

28:12.880 --> 28:17.720
Could we collect insurance
if a fire broke out here?

28:19.480 --> 28:20.760
A fire?

28:23.400 --> 28:27.920
Yeah, if the place
burns down in a fire.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.640
Like, if lightning strikes the winery
and it goes up in flames?

28:38.120 --> 28:41.680
Or if a joint happens to drop
into a puddle of gasoline.

28:45.400 --> 28:47.360
Doron, let's go somewhere.

28:48.080 --> 28:49.880
On vacation?

28:50.720 --> 28:53.680
No, not on vacation.

28:54.520 --> 28:55.840
For good.

28:58.920 --> 29:02.960
Remember how we imagined our lives
once you finish your service?

29:03.560 --> 29:05.680
That we'd be free

29:06.480 --> 29:08.360
and travel?

29:08.640 --> 29:11.120
The kids would learn
new languages,

29:12.560 --> 29:15.360
and we'd camp out at night

29:16.800 --> 29:18.840
and dance.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.600
Let's get away.

29:25.920 --> 29:28.320
Before it's too late.

29:33.480 --> 29:36.680
Sweetie, we've invested
1.5 million shekels in this place.

30:05.120 --> 30:07.160
For fuck's sake!

30:14.720 --> 30:16.880
Go ahead, Pinto.

30:20.760 --> 30:22.360
Yeah!

30:23.320 --> 30:25.000
Yeah!

30:26.240 --> 30:27.720
Go, Nurit.

30:30.240 --> 30:32.040
Yeah!

31:10.960 --> 31:14.360
<i>[Walid: I'll look after you and make</i>
<i>sure you get what you want.]</i>
