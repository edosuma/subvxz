01:51.904 --> 01:54.781
-All I can see is they're flicking---Mom, Mom.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.617
-Hey, honey.-Can we talk in the hall?

01:57.326 --> 01:58.327
Yeah.

01:59.661 --> 02:00.704
Just one sec.

02:01.705 --> 02:05.667
Wait, what? What is it?Is everything okay?

02:06.877 --> 02:08.169
I'm in love, Mom.

02:08.252 --> 02:10.005
Shut up. Who?

02:10.088 --> 02:12.049
-Bella.-Who?

02:12.132 --> 02:13.592
The girl leading the dances.

02:15.511 --> 02:18.639
I know she's old,but I think she's in love with me too.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.474
Okay.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.937
-Are we sure, babe?-Yes.

02:27.356 --> 02:28.357
Okay.

02:29.399 --> 02:30.442
Sure, sure?

02:30.526 --> 02:31.527
-Yes.-Okay.

02:39.117 --> 02:41.370
-I'll be right back.-Where are you going?

02:41.453 --> 02:43.080
-I'll meet you in the car.-Where you going?

02:43.163 --> 02:44.790
Just go to the car, please.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.258
-Andrew! Superstar!-Hi.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.760
You and I worked up a sweat tonight, huh?

02:58.095 --> 02:59.304
Yeah, I guess we did.

03:01.139 --> 03:04.434
Do you think I will ever see you again?

03:04.518 --> 03:05.978
Maybe for a date?

03:06.728 --> 03:10.482
I know I'm young,but maybe we can, like, look--

03:11.108 --> 03:12.109
I mean--

03:12.734 --> 03:15.028
Maybe we can just, like--

03:16.238 --> 03:18.574
I'm sorry, I'm really nervous.

03:19.241 --> 03:21.785
Well, this is the most flatteredI've ever felt.

03:24.162 --> 03:25.372
But…

03:28.709 --> 03:29.751
I'm old.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.597
-I actually need that.-I need it.

03:54.401 --> 03:55.569
The hell you doing?

03:56.361 --> 03:57.988
My baby's heartbroken.

05:26.869 --> 05:28.287
What are you gonna do?

05:28.370 --> 05:29.496
Kiss you.

05:30.747 --> 05:31.832
After college.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.170
Answer my question.

05:36.253 --> 05:39.006
I did. I'm going to kiss you after college

05:39.089 --> 05:41.884
because I've decidedI'm going to Barcelona with you.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.427
That's not funny.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.597
You're super drunk.

05:47.389 --> 05:48.515
No, I'm not.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.060
Okay.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.497
Just tell me what you're gonna do.

06:12.581 --> 06:14.124
I've told you what I'm gonna do.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.126
I'm gonna go home,

06:16.752 --> 06:19.880
and I'm gonna finda really great nonprofit to work at.

06:20.547 --> 06:23.133
So, you just want, like,chili on the corn dog?

06:24.676 --> 06:28.138
Do you want it, like, as a dipping sauce,or do you really want it on the corn dog?

06:28.222 --> 06:30.224
Hey, Maya. This is Andrew.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.978
Hello, Maya. This is Andrew.

06:35.062 --> 06:38.649
I'm at Meat Sticks right now,bored out of my mind,

06:38.732 --> 06:43.362
and I'm thinking of you, and I hopeyou're having a nice time in Barcelona.

06:43.445 --> 06:45.405
Did you ask your brother about tonight?

06:45.489 --> 06:47.115
No, I forgot.

06:47.199 --> 06:48.492
Ask me what?

06:48.992 --> 06:50.869
To take me to a bat mitzvah party.

06:50.953 --> 06:52.454
Well, where is it, little punk?

06:52.538 --> 06:54.039
Space Events in Englewood.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.123
Thank you, little punk.

06:55.207 --> 06:58.001
It's Cath's daughter, Pheeb.Macy's sister.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.837
Cath hates me right now,so I'm not gonna go.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.088
But I sent money.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.256
Is Macy in town?

07:02.339 --> 07:04.007
Yeah. I saw her at the service.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.968
I told her you were here. You should go.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.177
She'd be thrilled.

07:08.053 --> 07:09.763
Would that cramp your style?

07:09.847 --> 07:10.889
-No.-No.

07:10.973 --> 07:12.474
Do you have a crush on Phoebe?

07:12.558 --> 07:13.559
No.

07:13.642 --> 07:15.853
If she looks anything like Macy,you're a fucking liar.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.605
-Language, buddy.-It's fine, Greg. I'm 12.

07:18.689 --> 07:21.191
He doesn't have crushes.He has a girlfriend.

07:21.275 --> 07:22.484
Shut the hell up.

07:22.568 --> 07:23.944
You have a girlfriend?

07:24.027 --> 07:26.780
Girlfriend and puberty?Puberty and a girlfriend?

07:26.864 --> 07:28.615
-Yes.-Margaret.

07:30.284 --> 07:31.285
Mar--

07:31.368 --> 07:33.537
-Fuck off. That is like---No, uh-uh. No, Andrew.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.789
We're not in a Tulane dormitoryright now, okay?

07:36.373 --> 07:39.751
Yes, you're right. Sorry.We're in a 60-year-old's bachelor pad.

07:39.835 --> 07:41.003
No cursing.

07:41.587 --> 07:42.921
I'm just kidding.

07:43.005 --> 07:44.464
Kidding.

07:45.424 --> 07:47.467
My mom did a great job redecorating.

07:49.011 --> 07:50.470
Yeah. She sure did.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.017
Why does Cath hate you?

07:55.642 --> 07:57.102
I had a moment last week.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.980
Your mother had a…

08:01.064 --> 08:02.524
manic episode.

08:10.073 --> 08:13.285
Greg, I feel like your purpose on Earthis to make things weird.

08:14.870 --> 08:15.871
Do you?

08:15.954 --> 08:17.039
Yeah.

08:18.290 --> 08:19.917
All right. Let me take a look at you.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.252
Looking sharp.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.923
Wait. Turn around. Let me see something.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.175
Spank.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.928
I can't believe you're crashingmy little sister's bat mitzvah.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.929
I know. I didn't even go to the service.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.347
I'm here 'cause my mom's skipping,

08:34.431 --> 08:37.183
and David needs a family memberwith him at all times.

08:37.267 --> 08:38.809
-That's not true.-I'm just kidding.

08:38.894 --> 08:40.145
Is your mom okay?

08:40.979 --> 08:43.315
Yes. Yeah.I didn't really hear what happened.

08:43.899 --> 08:44.983
Yeah, neither did I.

08:45.067 --> 08:46.235
I think she's okay.

08:46.318 --> 08:48.487
"Is Cath okay?"is the more important question.

08:48.570 --> 08:49.863
Cath is great.

08:49.947 --> 08:52.658
She loves your mom.She loves every mom, really.

08:52.741 --> 08:56.370
Except this one crazy onethat used to sub at Newark.

08:56.453 --> 08:59.748
And apparently, she fucked Mr. Charleboisin the cafeteria bathroom.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.626
Mr. Charlebois our principal?

09:02.709 --> 09:05.629
I forgot you were here. Fuck.I keep forgetting I'm around children.

09:11.677 --> 09:14.596
Pheeb starting off strongwith the innocuous games theme.

09:14.680 --> 09:17.140
You know, it was going to be"Under the Sea with Pheeb,"

09:17.224 --> 09:18.600
but she had to call a last-minute audible

09:18.684 --> 09:21.478
'cause her bitch friend, Gigi Rothman,is obsessed with Little Mermaid,

09:21.562 --> 09:23.063
and she forced her to change it.

09:23.146 --> 09:24.731
-What a bitch.-Bitch.

09:24.815 --> 09:26.441
-Bitch.-Yeah.

09:26.525 --> 09:28.277
Do you have a job now or…

09:28.360 --> 09:31.196
We're not allowed to talk about jobsat the bat mitzvah party, actually.

09:31.280 --> 09:34.366
Okay. So you either don't have a jobor you have a bad job.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.660
-I have a bad job. Yeah.-Yeah, see?

09:39.663 --> 09:41.039
It's the crazy mom.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.500
That's the mom I was just talking about.

09:43.584 --> 09:47.713
I am looking at a high schoolerwith her stunning French au pair.

09:47.796 --> 09:50.090
That's a mom and her kid.

09:50.174 --> 09:52.467
So she was, like, a tween mom maybe.

09:52.551 --> 09:54.970
No, that kid's in Davidand Phoebe's grade.

09:55.053 --> 09:58.390
I think she's autistic or something.So, her mom had her start school late.

09:59.141 --> 10:01.435
That's just terrible for both of them.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.270
Cath thinks she smokes crack.

10:03.353 --> 10:04.438
The autistic girl?

10:04.521 --> 10:06.523
Can I have a vodka cranberry, please?

10:07.482 --> 10:09.318
No, actually, can I get a vodka soda?

10:09.985 --> 10:11.403
Actually, no. Vodka cranberry.

10:15.824 --> 10:18.452
Thirteen! Let's do this!

10:20.579 --> 10:21.872
Let's go.

10:23.123 --> 10:26.293
Come on, everybody. There we go.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.378
Come on, Phoebe.That's it. You'll be great.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.172
Getting it started.

10:34.843 --> 10:36.345
Oh, no.

10:36.428 --> 10:39.932
Uh-oh. Here comes Mom. Take cover.

10:44.186 --> 10:46.188
Go, Mom!

10:48.857 --> 10:51.443
Move that thang. Yeah.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.537
Boys. What's going on over here?

11:01.620 --> 11:04.164
Are we not gonna--Are we not gonna dance at some point?

11:04.248 --> 11:07.292
What about you, sir? Don't you havea girlfriend you should be dancing with?

11:07.376 --> 11:08.627
I don't really talk to her.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.671
Great.

11:10.754 --> 11:13.006
What about you, Rod?You seem like a real shot of life.

11:13.090 --> 11:14.675
Why are you not on the floor?Do you not dance?

11:14.758 --> 11:16.677
I can dance. This music just sucks.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.470
I agree with you. I really agree with you.

11:19.054 --> 11:22.224
Is there a songthat would get you dancing?

11:23.308 --> 11:25.102
"Fooly Cooly" by BoyBand.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.312
If I get DJ Rich to play that song,

11:27.396 --> 11:30.023
do you promise that you willdance your freaking butt off?

11:30.107 --> 11:32.609
Yes. That'd be so freaking hype.

11:38.156 --> 11:41.368
Nice work. You want me to beat youin tic-tac-toe?

11:42.202 --> 11:44.204
Or do you wanna mingle a little bit?

11:45.122 --> 11:46.331
You wanna head home?

11:47.165 --> 11:48.500
You're not going to beat me.

11:48.584 --> 11:50.002
I think I'm gonna beat you.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.796
I think I'm gonna kick your cute ass.

11:53.714 --> 11:56.508
Shit! Come on. Play the song, baby!

12:02.639 --> 12:04.308
Do you wanna be X's or O's?

12:04.391 --> 12:05.559
-O's.-X's.

12:06.602 --> 12:07.603
Hi, honey.

12:08.187 --> 12:11.315
-I haven't seen you in such a long time.-I know.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.524
I wish your mom was here.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.152
-I will tell her you said that.-Please do.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.653
Did you get a job yet?

12:17.404 --> 12:20.824
Your daughter asked me the same question,and I don't have a great answer.

12:20.908 --> 12:25.621
But you don't have a party starterhere tonight, so that is my job.

12:25.704 --> 12:26.914
And it'll be free of charge.

12:26.997 --> 12:29.082
We thought DJ Rich would be enough, so…

12:29.166 --> 12:31.877
You were super wrong,'cause he's really bad at his job.

12:31.960 --> 12:35.130
But it's okay because,table four, I have a question.

12:35.214 --> 12:37.466
Do we like the song called "Funky Town"?

12:40.219 --> 12:42.054
We shouldn't go dance, should we?

12:42.137 --> 12:45.474
-We definitely should not do that. Yeah.-Are you sure?

12:46.058 --> 12:49.520
You can put your headphones on,and we can just go in the corner.

12:49.603 --> 12:52.272
Nobody's dancing with their motherwith headphones on.

12:52.356 --> 12:55.359
Hey. Do you two dance?

12:57.361 --> 12:58.570
Sometimes.

12:59.488 --> 13:01.406
But we're not feeling it right now.

13:01.490 --> 13:03.825
So maybe in a bit.

13:03.909 --> 13:05.702
Amazing. Well, yeah, no rush at all.

13:05.786 --> 13:10.082
But, tonight is the night, so…

13:11.625 --> 13:13.001
What night?

13:13.085 --> 13:14.294
Did you say "what night"?

13:14.378 --> 13:16.839
No, I did not. My mother did.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.049
What's your mother's name?

13:19.132 --> 13:20.342
Her name is Domino.

13:20.425 --> 13:21.760
Domino. I'm Andrew.

13:21.844 --> 13:22.970
Hi, Andrew.

13:23.053 --> 13:24.680
Can I ask your name?

13:24.763 --> 13:25.764
Lola.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.224
Your name is Lola?

13:27.724 --> 13:30.477
That's literallymy favorite name of all time.

13:30.561 --> 13:32.771
My mother, Domino, named me.

13:34.189 --> 13:36.817
Well, Domino, to answer your question--

13:37.776 --> 13:38.861
What was your question?

13:39.778 --> 13:43.574
You said, "Tonight's the night."And I said, "What night?"

13:43.657 --> 13:46.577
Tonight is the nightthat you and Lola dance your booties off.

13:47.661 --> 13:50.080
There is no rush at all. No hurry.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.917
Just know that nobody on the dance flooris gonna have nearly as much fun

13:54.001 --> 13:56.503
if you guys aren't there, so…

14:00.090 --> 14:01.175
I don't know how to moonwalk.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.113
Yeah!

14:27.284 --> 14:28.368
Go, Pheeb!

14:48.305 --> 14:49.306
Hey.

14:50.265 --> 14:51.266
Hi.

14:52.267 --> 14:53.310
What are you gonna get?

14:54.520 --> 14:56.438
I am gonna try to find something

14:56.522 --> 15:00.317
that will give me some courageto ask Lola to slow dance.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.362
That is very sweet, but she won't dance.

15:04.238 --> 15:05.239
It's okay.

15:07.324 --> 15:08.492
Lola's autistic.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.828
That's why she's working on her cubeat the bat mitzvah party.

15:12.454 --> 15:13.997
Not because the party's…

15:15.541 --> 15:17.334
-game-themed. Yes.-Game-themed.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.254
Is that hard?

15:20.337 --> 15:22.047
Yeah, the cu-- It's really hard.

15:22.130 --> 15:24.675
I can't do it for the life of me,but she's really good at it.

15:24.758 --> 15:27.094
-I meant the---I know what you meant.

15:28.053 --> 15:30.055
Nope. I mean, sometimes.

15:31.139 --> 15:32.391
But not because of her.

15:34.226 --> 15:35.227
I'm sorry.

15:36.061 --> 15:38.063
Sometimes I think I'm autistic.

15:39.815 --> 15:40.858
You do?

15:43.569 --> 15:45.112
Well… no.

15:47.406 --> 15:48.907
-That wasn't real.-It happened.

15:48.991 --> 15:50.492
-I'm really sorry.-I'm gonna remember it.

15:50.576 --> 15:53.787
I thinkI could get her on the dance floor.

15:53.871 --> 15:56.039
I will give you $1,000.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.791
Like you'd bet me $1,000?

15:57.875 --> 15:59.459
-No, I'd just give it to you.-No.

15:59.543 --> 16:02.212
Okay, well, that's no fun.How about I bet you--

16:02.296 --> 16:04.590
I'll bet you $300I can get her on the dance floor.

17:09.445 --> 17:10.989
This kid rocks.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.449
He's adorable.

17:13.575 --> 17:15.743
He's even making me not hate Hoochie Slut.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.954
Cathy,that is not even close to appropriate.

17:18.038 --> 17:19.080
She fucked my husband.

17:19.164 --> 17:21.625
-She did not fuck Todd. Why would she?-I can say whatever I want.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.752
It wouldn't have been as much funif you weren't there.

17:23.836 --> 17:25.295
I mean, that's entirely true.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.506
But when I'm not there,just don't be shy. Dance.

17:27.589 --> 17:28.799
You're a really good dancer.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.802
Margaret was so smitten with you.

17:31.885 --> 17:34.930
Girls love good dancers,and the boys do too.

17:35.514 --> 17:36.765
Why do you think I'm gay?

17:36.849 --> 17:39.476
I just think you shouldn't sayfor certain who you are

17:39.560 --> 17:41.436
until, like, junior year of college.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.230
What happens junior year?

17:43.313 --> 17:44.731
-Lots of things.-Andrew.

17:45.649 --> 17:47.734
-Hi.-Hey. I thought you guys left.

17:47.818 --> 17:49.862
We wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.

17:50.487 --> 17:51.572
Lola, do you know David?

17:52.155 --> 17:53.907
-Yes.-Hi, Lola.

17:53.991 --> 17:55.450
Hi, David.

17:56.577 --> 17:58.829
We had science class together last year.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.539
God, you guys are cute.

18:00.622 --> 18:05.335
Andrew, Lola and I wanted to saythank you for dancing with us.

18:05.419 --> 18:09.923
And, David, I know I'll probablysee a lot of you at these parties.

18:10.007 --> 18:11.717
But, Andrew, I need your Venmo

18:11.800 --> 18:14.094
-because I might never see you again.-Right.

18:14.178 --> 18:17.931
Well, I think we have to see Andrew again.

18:18.682 --> 18:20.767
Ladies, what is happening here?

18:20.851 --> 18:22.936
I'm staying in New Jersey for a while,

18:23.020 --> 18:26.523
so I will definitely bring Davidto another bar mitzvah.

18:26.607 --> 18:28.108
Well, I am happy to hear that,

18:28.192 --> 18:31.320
because what's happening right now isyou're being swarmed by Jewish mothers

18:31.403 --> 18:34.156
who are recruiting youto be their motivational dancer.

18:34.239 --> 18:36.033
You mean like the party starters?

18:36.116 --> 18:36.950
-Yes.-Nuh-uh.

18:37.034 --> 18:39.578
They said he made sureeveryone had a perfect night.

18:39.661 --> 18:41.872
And they needa designated party orchestrator.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.498
Andrew, this is so fun.

18:43.582 --> 18:44.833
-You think?-Yes!

18:44.917 --> 18:47.127
I don't know. I wanna hearwhat Greg thinks about it first.

18:47.211 --> 18:48.670
Don't be mean. Stop.

18:48.754 --> 18:51.507
This is so good. You can start a company.

18:52.090 --> 18:53.842
Yeah. I mean,I hate working at Meat Sticks,

18:53.926 --> 18:55.302
and I really enjoyed my night. So…

18:55.385 --> 18:58.222
Well, you wouldn'tquit Meat Sticks altogether.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.015
You'd just cut down on your hours.

19:00.098 --> 19:02.392
Did they mention how much you'd make?

19:02.476 --> 19:05.479
How much does a party starter get paid,I wonder.

19:05.562 --> 19:09.107
I think they said just underwhat an unhappy pharmaceutical exec makes.

19:09.733 --> 19:10.943
What the hell does that mean?

19:11.026 --> 19:12.653
Honey, that's not funny.

19:19.034 --> 19:20.577
Are you thinking about Andrew?

19:20.661 --> 19:21.662
No.

19:23.705 --> 19:27.876
I'm thinking about feeding Jerrycauliflower and cucumber tomorrow.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.504
Well, big day for you tomorrow, Jerry.

19:34.925 --> 19:37.052
What did Andrew say to get you dancing?

19:37.135 --> 19:40.889
Andrew said he would buy mea MoYu 13-by-13 Magic Cube

19:40.973 --> 19:43.600
with the $300 you were going to give him.

19:50.482 --> 19:52.860
Do you thinkhe would be a good sitter for you?

19:52.943 --> 19:55.779
Well, I do not do well with sitters,

19:56.613 --> 19:59.366
but I think it might be a bit differentwith Andrew.

19:59.449 --> 20:00.701
Why?

20:00.784 --> 20:03.954
I like him.And I think he would like Jerry.

20:04.913 --> 20:07.499
Also, I do not thinkhe would treat me like a baby.

20:17.259 --> 20:19.011
You have to just brush him off.

20:19.094 --> 20:22.014
-I really can't live here.-Can you not talk like that, please?

20:22.848 --> 20:24.141
Greg's a dick. He is.

20:24.224 --> 20:26.185
-Can you not use that language?-That's why I'm out of here

20:26.268 --> 20:27.561
as soon as I have some money.

20:27.644 --> 20:30.230
Stop. What I was gonna say is,Greg's a dick,

20:30.314 --> 20:33.066
but I put up with it becausehe and Mom are good for each other.

20:34.484 --> 20:35.694
Thanks, honey.

20:36.820 --> 20:37.988
Literally how?

20:42.409 --> 20:44.620
Are you happy? Does he make you happy?

20:44.703 --> 20:47.289
I'm happy here, okay?

20:48.665 --> 20:52.211
I don't have to worry aboutso many things because of Greg.

20:53.003 --> 20:55.672
And I don't expect youto understand that yet.

21:03.931 --> 21:06.391
Okay, I'm done talking about Greg.

21:09.978 --> 21:12.105
What's your business going to be called?

21:12.189 --> 21:13.232
Hey.

21:13.982 --> 21:15.150
Tell me.

21:15.234 --> 21:17.444
You're really gonna love it.David came up with it.

21:18.070 --> 21:19.071
What?

21:21.406 --> 21:22.616
Jig Conductor.

21:29.581 --> 21:32.793
If anybody knows how to start a party,it's my brother, Andrew.

21:33.460 --> 21:36.672
Or should I say, the Jig Conductor?

21:41.844 --> 21:43.303
It stopped.

21:43.387 --> 21:45.138
It broke 'cause it stopped.

21:45.222 --> 21:46.431
That's all there is.

21:46.515 --> 21:48.725
When-- You have to finish it.

21:48.809 --> 21:51.645
Fuck no, Mom. If anybody sees thatI'm gonna get put on a watch list.

21:51.728 --> 21:55.107
It's cute. David is so cute.

21:55.190 --> 21:57.776
What are you talking about?Did you just watch what I watched?

21:57.860 --> 21:59.778
The camera hates him.He's stiff as a board.

21:59.862 --> 22:01.363
So what he's a little stiff?

22:01.446 --> 22:03.991
It's fine. It's so cute. It's so good.

22:04.074 --> 22:08.328
Mom, I don't need to do a video.This thing isn't-- It's not like that.

22:08.412 --> 22:09.621
Like what? Like a job?

22:09.705 --> 22:11.999
Yeah, I get paid,but I don't have to think of it as a job.

22:12.082 --> 22:15.294
Okay. Well, you do have to think of itas a job if you want a job.

22:15.377 --> 22:16.670
I don't want to think of it as a job.

22:16.753 --> 22:19.047
I just want to get enough moneyto go to Barcelona.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.720
Because that's whereMaya is doing her Fulbright?

22:24.803 --> 22:27.890
No. A little, yes.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.767
But also 'cause that's where I want to go.

22:31.476 --> 22:33.395
Okay, sweetie. You just--

22:33.478 --> 22:35.772
You didn't tell me thatthat's what you wanted to do.

22:35.856 --> 22:38.609
'Cause I didn't wanna make you sad.

22:42.029 --> 22:47.993
As long as you're doing what youwant to do, then I'm perfectly happy.

22:48.076 --> 22:51.538
I just want to make surethat you're doing what you want to do.

22:51.622 --> 22:54.374
You can't just go with everything.

22:54.458 --> 22:56.919
I'm not just going with Maya to Barcelona.

22:57.002 --> 22:59.213
I really want to go.It'd be a huge deal. I--

22:59.296 --> 23:01.548
Barcelona is, like,the place that I've always wanted to go.

23:01.632 --> 23:03.884
Okay. Well, I think it's really weirdthat you never mentioned it--

23:03.967 --> 23:06.595
-I-- Stop. Mom, stop!-You never told me anything about Barcel--

23:06.678 --> 23:09.932
-Just stop. I don't want---I want to help. I'm just trying to help.

23:10.015 --> 23:11.808
-I don't want your help. Stop!-Okay.

23:32.162 --> 23:34.748
Oh, my gosh. Hold on.Two seconds, everybody.

23:39.211 --> 23:41.046
Who knocked this over?

23:43.549 --> 23:46.301
Here we go. We need to plug in.

23:47.386 --> 23:48.428
You dance as well.

23:48.512 --> 23:50.472
Go dance. You got to go dance.

24:11.118 --> 24:13.579
Let's do the Motziand toasts after this song.

24:13.662 --> 24:15.789
-God, you scared me so bad.-What's that bottle?

24:15.873 --> 24:16.957
My water bottle?

24:17.833 --> 24:19.668
The one with "vodka" written on it?

24:20.794 --> 24:23.380
Uh-huh. No… it's a joke.

24:23.463 --> 24:26.633
I was just, like, joking with my friendsone time, and I put it on there.

24:26.717 --> 24:28.427
And it's, like, so people won't drink it.

24:28.510 --> 24:31.221
Okay, but I don't wantyou drinking tonight.

24:33.307 --> 24:35.267
I won't. S-- I'm sorry.

24:42.274 --> 24:45.194
Everybody, you did an amazing job dancing.

24:45.277 --> 24:49.823
And now it is time for the Motziand the Kiddush and the toasts.

24:49.907 --> 24:51.533
Now I will pass it off to you.

24:59.958 --> 25:04.046
Amen

25:04.129 --> 25:05.422
Mazel tov.

25:09.301 --> 25:12.596
Okay. Go, Jakey!

25:12.679 --> 25:16.475
All right, everybody. Next song isa request from Rabbi Steinberg.

25:16.558 --> 25:18.393
It's called "WAP."

25:18.477 --> 25:20.687
I'm just kidding, Rabbi Steinberg.That was a joke.

25:38.038 --> 25:41.083
Macaroni in a potThat's some wet-ass pussy

25:41.166 --> 25:43.043
That song. He can't play that.

25:56.890 --> 25:59.935
Hey, buddy. Why'd that girl just leave?

26:00.018 --> 26:01.562
Probably 'cause she's too old.

26:02.604 --> 26:05.983
You feeling a little bit insecureabout her being taller than you?

26:06.066 --> 26:07.734
She's only taller than me'cause she's autistic

26:07.818 --> 26:09.319
and got held back, like, three years.

26:09.403 --> 26:11.488
She's, like, three years older than us.

26:12.990 --> 26:14.700
Were you being mean to her?

26:14.783 --> 26:16.952
You trying to trick her into thinkingshe can't beat you up?

26:17.828 --> 26:18.871
She can't beat me up.

26:19.788 --> 26:21.623
You know who can beat you up for sure?

26:21.707 --> 26:22.666
What's going on here?

26:23.250 --> 26:25.043
Nothing.This kid's just kind of being a bully.

26:25.127 --> 26:27.087
Sorry, my son is being what?

26:27.838 --> 26:29.381
Your son's being a prick.

26:29.464 --> 26:30.841
Do I smell alcohol, kid?

26:30.924 --> 26:31.925
What?

26:32.509 --> 26:33.886
Fuck off, adult.

26:33.969 --> 26:35.304
Wow. Nice.

26:35.387 --> 26:36.513
You're Lisa's kid?

26:37.973 --> 26:39.850
You guys call me kid one more time.

26:39.933 --> 26:41.643
-What did you say?-What's going on here?

26:41.727 --> 26:44.396
Your DJ is being extremely inappropriatewith my family.

26:44.479 --> 26:45.647
What?

26:45.731 --> 26:47.399
Andrew, explain to me what's going on.

26:47.482 --> 26:49.526
I just wanted to make sure no onewas being bullied at the party.

26:49.610 --> 26:51.486
I think you should go home.I'm very disturbed.

26:51.570 --> 26:53.405
I think you should go homeand take your kid with you.

26:53.488 --> 26:55.866
-Do not speak to her like that, Andrew.-You tell her not to--

26:55.949 --> 26:58.577
-Okay, you're gonna leave. Let's go.-You embarrassed Rabbi Steinberg.

26:58.660 --> 27:01.330
And you told peopleto dance their wet-ass pussies off.

27:05.459 --> 27:08.921
Hey, where's your mom?Her bag was in there ready to get stolen.

27:09.004 --> 27:10.964
I do not know where my mother is.

27:12.633 --> 27:14.009
Can I sit down with you?

27:14.092 --> 27:15.135
Yes.

27:15.719 --> 27:16.845
Found your cube.

27:17.679 --> 27:18.805
Thanks.

27:25.229 --> 27:29.316
Do you want to tell me whatthat mean little bitch kid said to you?

27:29.900 --> 27:32.236
That I do not belong in his grade.

27:36.490 --> 27:38.575
Are you okay? Did that make you mad?

27:39.326 --> 27:41.203
I just wanted to walk away.

27:43.205 --> 27:44.540
Well, that's really awesome of you

27:44.623 --> 27:47.334
because I almost kicked his assand got thrown in jail.

27:53.715 --> 27:54.967
Okay, while you work on that,

27:55.050 --> 27:58.220
I'm gonna go try to find your motherbecause I think she's probably worried.

27:58.303 --> 27:59.388
Okay.

27:59.888 --> 28:03.016
Hi, women's bathroom.I'm looking for someone.

Do you want me to seeif someone has a tampon or something?

29:27.184 --> 29:28.185

29:29.895 --> 29:31.939
Andrew,I need you to help me get to my car

29:32.022 --> 29:35.609

29:35.692 --> 29:38.111
Yeah, it does look like that. Do you--

29:38.195 --> 29:41.198
That's a period? Do you want my--

29:43.116 --> 29:44.868
Do you wanna wear my coat? I have a coat.

29:44.952 --> 29:46.787
I don't think your coatis gonna cover my ass.

29:46.870 --> 29:48.747
I feel like it is. I'm pretty tall.

29:48.830 --> 29:53.502
I don't want the parents to seeme wearing some guy's jacket.

29:57.631 --> 29:59.049
Okay. I think I have an idea.

30:01.802 --> 30:04.012
-Hey.-I finished. Did you find my mother?

30:04.096 --> 30:05.597
Great job. Yes, I did find your mother.

30:05.681 --> 30:09.268
And she's got a bit ofa visual situation going on

30:09.351 --> 30:11.937
because she spilled somethingon her dress, but I have a plan.

30:12.020 --> 30:13.021
What did she spill?

30:13.105 --> 30:14.106
Steak.

30:14.690 --> 30:16.483
She-- But I-- So, I have a plan.

30:16.567 --> 30:18.527
My mother was not eating steak.

30:18.610 --> 30:20.863
Someone else spilled steak onto her.

30:20.946 --> 30:22.531
But it doesn't matter'cause I have a plan,

30:22.614 --> 30:25.158
and you're going to playa super important role in that plan

30:25.242 --> 30:27.035
because I can't go back into the party.

30:27.786 --> 30:28.787
Okay.

30:29.955 --> 30:31.582
Excuse me, David.

30:31.665 --> 30:35.878
Your brother, Andrew, has asked meto ask you to help me with a plan.

30:37.004 --> 30:38.005
Okay.

30:40.966 --> 30:42.509
Hello, sir.

30:52.477 --> 30:55.606
Domino, I'd really like to driveyou and Lola home if that's okay.

30:56.440 --> 30:58.650
And I think we should maybestop at the hospital.

31:01.445 --> 31:03.322
I don't need to go to the hospital.

31:03.405 --> 31:04.406
I'm fine.

31:05.741 --> 31:08.535
Okay. Well, you look totally fine, so…

31:11.496 --> 31:12.915
Do you want a hug or something?

31:12.998 --> 31:14.291
No.

31:36.855 --> 31:37.940
Okay. I love you.

31:38.023 --> 31:39.107
I love you too.

32:00.963 --> 32:02.172
What do you wanna do?

32:02.256 --> 32:05.592
You want to hang out down herewhile Andrew waits for a ride?

32:05.676 --> 32:07.719
I want to get in my pajamas.

32:07.803 --> 32:09.888
Okay, cutie. Do your thing.

32:10.556 --> 32:12.683
I'll be up in a bit to say good night.

32:29.616 --> 32:32.494
Sorry I'm close to you.You looked like you were gonna fall over.

32:35.372 --> 32:36.832
I need to sit down.

32:50.846 --> 32:52.097
I need to take a shower.

32:53.182 --> 32:54.933
I feel like we should just sit here.

32:55.809 --> 32:58.061
I wanna get out of this fucking T-shirt.

33:02.441 --> 33:03.901
I like your shirt.

33:08.030 --> 33:09.656
Then why don't you marry it?

33:24.379 --> 33:25.464
Domino.

33:26.673 --> 33:27.799
Are you all right?

33:29.801 --> 33:30.886
Yes.

33:33.180 --> 33:34.306
Thank you.

34:11.134 --> 34:12.469
Hey.

34:12.553 --> 34:13.594
Sorry I scared you.

34:13.679 --> 34:16.806
It's okay. Where's my mother?

34:16.889 --> 34:21.061
She's-- I thinkshe's brushing her teeth too, actually.

34:25.858 --> 34:27.234
Do you want to meet my hamster?

34:28.610 --> 34:29.610
Yeah.

34:42.123 --> 34:43.500
Oh, my gosh.

34:44.793 --> 34:46.210
Here you go, Jerry.

34:46.295 --> 34:49.089
Man, I love Jerry. He is very cute.

34:49.172 --> 34:50.674
Good Lord.

34:52.134 --> 34:54.969
So, school is starting soon.Are you excited?

34:55.554 --> 34:57.181
I'm excited for parts.

34:57.681 --> 34:58.932
You bummed summer is over?

34:59.016 --> 35:00.851
A little bit, yes.

35:01.518 --> 35:04.479
Do you collect potato mashers?

35:04.563 --> 35:05.939
Yes, I do.

35:06.023 --> 35:07.774
That's really awesome.

35:09.943 --> 35:13.822
So, what do you usually dobefore bed besides feed Jer,

35:13.906 --> 35:16.158
and get in pj's and brush your teeth?

35:16.825 --> 35:20.621
My mom sometimes will scratch my back,but I do not want you to do that.

35:20.704 --> 35:23.498
I do not let anybodybut my mother touch my back.

35:23.582 --> 35:25.209
Yeah. No, that makes total sense.

35:28.212 --> 35:29.546
Why are you here?

35:30.255 --> 35:32.549
Ouch. You're trying to hurt my feelings?

35:33.217 --> 35:35.761
-No.-Well, Lola, that was kind of brutal.

35:35.844 --> 35:37.679
I did not mean to be brutal.

35:39.348 --> 35:40.349
I'm just teasing.

35:42.601 --> 35:44.645
Your mom just had a tough night

35:44.728 --> 35:47.523
and I wanted to make sureyou guys were all good.

35:48.732 --> 35:51.610
But I am going to leave right now.

35:51.693 --> 35:56.490
And I'm going to see you at Lexi Ray'sbat mitzvah party, if you're going.

35:56.573 --> 35:58.700
I think I will be in attendance.

35:58.784 --> 36:00.118
Excellent.

36:00.202 --> 36:02.579
Okay. Well, good night.

36:02.663 --> 36:06.625
-Good night to you too, Andrew.-And good night to you too, Jerry.

36:07.751 --> 36:10.045
That's a really cute freaking hamster.

36:10.546 --> 36:11.713
Hello.

36:13.423 --> 36:14.424
Hey.

36:15.175 --> 36:16.385
Hi.

36:16.468 --> 36:18.428
Lola just introduced me to Jerry.

36:18.512 --> 36:20.722
Oh, yeah. She's really proud of him.

36:21.306 --> 36:24.351
Are you hiding something in there?

36:25.018 --> 36:26.103
Yes.

36:28.105 --> 36:29.481
-I'm gonna go and say good night.-Okay.

36:29.565 --> 36:33.235
But if you wanna wait downstairsin the living room, we can talk.

36:33.819 --> 36:34.820
Okay.

36:35.904 --> 36:37.114
I'm glad you're here.

36:37.197 --> 36:38.490
I thought you left.

36:48.584 --> 36:51.170
-Do you have a husband?-I have a fiancé.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.422
Joseph.

36:53.505 --> 36:54.590
He's in Chicago.

36:54.673 --> 36:57.718
He's not Lola's dad, right?

36:57.801 --> 36:58.802
No.

36:59.928 --> 37:01.138
This is his parents' house.

37:02.181 --> 37:03.182
His parents are here?

37:04.725 --> 37:06.226
He inherited it.

37:14.943 --> 37:17.946
I feel very comfortable with you.I don't know why.

37:18.655 --> 37:19.865
But I do.

37:21.325 --> 37:22.826
Why wouldn't you feel comfortable?

37:22.910 --> 37:25.204
Lola said you askedabout her potato mashers.

37:25.287 --> 37:27.122
Your kid is super dope.

37:27.956 --> 37:32.503
And I was thinking, I used to help outfamilies in my neighborhood,

37:33.086 --> 37:36.673
like, if parents wanted a night out,I would stay with their kids.

37:36.757 --> 37:38.550
Or, like, even watch their house.

37:38.634 --> 37:43.931
And I was wondering if, like, you and Lolahave a situation like that with someone.

37:44.515 --> 37:46.517
-Who I need to kill.-No.

37:47.726 --> 37:48.852
No, I wish.

37:48.936 --> 37:51.813
I'd usually just bring herto my parents' house, but…

37:52.898 --> 37:55.567
they live very far away, and it's a pain.

37:56.068 --> 37:58.779
Well, if you don't want to do that ever,

37:58.862 --> 38:03.242
call me because I really like to siton my ass and hang out with people.

38:04.535 --> 38:07.996
But I understand if you don't want to,because we don't really know each other.

38:09.831 --> 38:11.083
We know each other.

38:11.750 --> 38:13.502
Yeah. Right?

38:16.129 --> 38:18.382
Do you have a piece of papersomewhere in here?

38:21.969 --> 38:25.430
Okay. My number is on this slip of paper,

38:25.514 --> 38:30.102
and I'm gonna call a rideso you can get some rest.

38:30.185 --> 38:36.817
But I'd really like for you to callor text me if you ever want a night out

38:36.900 --> 38:38.235
or, like, want some help.

38:40.988 --> 38:41.989
Okay.

38:43.699 --> 38:45.659
You wanna sitwhile you wait for your ride?

38:46.577 --> 38:48.245
Yes. On the floor again?

38:50.038 --> 38:51.290
We've upgraded.

38:52.833 --> 38:55.836
I really like your couch.

38:56.336 --> 38:57.546
I hate it.

38:57.629 --> 38:59.756
Me too. That's what I meant to say.

39:03.969 --> 39:05.345
Are you gonna be okay tonight?

39:05.429 --> 39:06.638
Yeah.

39:13.687 --> 39:15.189
It wasn't a period.

39:17.941 --> 39:19.276
I'm so sorry.

39:22.571 --> 39:24.198
That's what I was thinking.

39:25.282 --> 39:27.451
Did Joseph know that you were pregnant?

39:34.958 --> 39:37.586
Let's not tell anybody about this.

39:37.669 --> 39:38.837
Okay.

39:42.299 --> 39:46.595
Well, if you ever want anyone to talk to,I've got massive ears.

39:48.263 --> 39:49.389
Where's your ride?

39:50.057 --> 39:51.183
Oh, my God.

39:52.017 --> 39:54.478
Probably very close.It's about three minutes.

40:02.653 --> 40:04.947
I don't feel like…

40:05.030 --> 40:06.031
Okay.

40:11.703 --> 40:14.414
I mean, I want to.But I feel like you don't want to.

40:19.378 --> 40:20.420
It's okay.

40:42.442 --> 40:45.112
Hello, Macy. What are you doing tonight?

40:48.615 --> 40:50.617
-Are you sure nobody's here right now?-Yeah.

40:50.701 --> 40:52.953
Yeah. My parentsare at a bridge tournament.

40:53.036 --> 40:54.830
-My sister's at a sleepover.-Okay.

40:54.913 --> 40:56.790
So, yeah, we can be loud.

40:56.874 --> 40:58.959
Yeah. Go harder. Yeah.

41:03.338 --> 41:05.549
-Why are you staring at me?-I'm not.

41:05.632 --> 41:08.051
-Close your eyes. Why are your eyes open?-My eyes are closed.

41:08.135 --> 41:09.303
They were open.

41:16.894 --> 41:18.645
You can toss that in the bathroom.

41:39.666 --> 41:43.587
Who are you, Mr. Fucker?

41:44.922 --> 41:51.178
The hell are you doingwith my lover, fucker?

41:56.934 --> 41:58.894
I can't believe college is over.

41:58.977 --> 42:00.521
I can't believe we just had sex.

42:00.604 --> 42:03.941
-Why?-I don't know. I just feel old.

42:04.483 --> 42:05.984
Like, I had algebra with you.

42:06.068 --> 42:09.363
And bio. With Dr. Mindle.

42:09.446 --> 42:10.614
Did you have a crush on me?

42:10.697 --> 42:12.491
Everybody had a crush on you.

42:13.283 --> 42:14.368
Yeah, but did you?

42:15.244 --> 42:16.995
I mean, I was attracted to you.

42:17.079 --> 42:22.042
But I feel like-- I think I felt likeyou had so many people.

42:22.626 --> 42:24.002
A lot of suitors.

42:25.712 --> 42:27.005
I wasn't attracted to you.

42:29.132 --> 42:31.426
So I actually didn't ask that.

42:31.510 --> 42:33.387
But I appreciate the honesty.

42:33.470 --> 42:35.305
I was attracted to youat my sister's bat mitzvah.

42:35.389 --> 42:36.723
And now you're not?

42:36.807 --> 42:40.686
-Now I'm thinking about algebra.-And bio with Dr. Mindle.

42:45.274 --> 42:46.859
Do you think I peaked already?

42:49.486 --> 42:50.487
No.

42:52.531 --> 42:53.532
Of course not.

42:53.615 --> 42:55.367
I just really hate my job.

42:56.368 --> 42:59.580
If only I could quit my joband be a party starter.

42:59.663 --> 43:01.915
And a Meat Sticks worker.

43:01.999 --> 43:05.002
ButI actually just applied for this job.

43:05.085 --> 43:08.797
It was a--It's a Newark chief officer zone

43:08.881 --> 43:13.468
opportunity analyst intern.

43:14.261 --> 43:17.598
-Cool.-I didn't get it. I got rejected.

43:18.223 --> 43:19.975
Do you think I should quit party starting?

43:20.058 --> 43:22.060
Well, on one hand, it is silly.

43:22.144 --> 43:23.145
It's really silly.

43:23.228 --> 43:25.564
But on the other hand, so is every job.

43:26.148 --> 43:27.649
Like, selling your time is insane.

43:27.733 --> 43:29.735
That's really depressing.

43:30.444 --> 43:32.321
I do think you're a sexy dancer.

43:34.364 --> 43:35.365
No.

43:36.033 --> 43:37.034
Come on.

43:38.035 --> 43:40.037
-Do you wanna have sex again?-Not at all.

43:42.331 --> 43:45.334
No, man.We don't have alcohol. I wish we did.

43:45.417 --> 43:48.545
But no, we don't have our liquor licensehere in the mall.

43:48.629 --> 43:50.255
Hey. How's Margaret?

43:50.339 --> 43:51.882
Are you guys talking yet?

43:51.965 --> 43:55.177
Not really.We just text and dance at bar mitzvahs.

43:55.260 --> 43:56.345
Yeah, you do.

43:56.428 --> 43:59.473
Your chemistry with heron the dance floor is pretty insane.

44:00.682 --> 44:01.892
Are you just saying that?

44:01.975 --> 44:05.145
I'm saying that 'cause I have two eyes.You guys are electric together.

44:05.938 --> 44:07.481
When did you have your first kiss?

44:10.067 --> 44:11.068
Why do you ask?

44:11.151 --> 44:13.695
Margaret's friend told methat she wants to kiss.

44:13.779 --> 44:14.905
Uh-oh.

44:15.614 --> 44:17.407
And how do we feel about that?

44:17.491 --> 44:19.326
Answer with your badass shades off.

44:21.537 --> 44:23.080
I don't know how to make it happen.

44:25.249 --> 44:27.876
All right. Lesson one.

44:27.960 --> 44:31.213
Forty percent of it is instinct.

44:31.296 --> 44:34.132
Like, if it feels right,it probably is right.

44:34.216 --> 44:35.801
Go with your gut.

44:35.884 --> 44:38.971
And then 10% is your brainand all that stuff.

44:39.054 --> 44:41.014
Like game plan, strategy.

44:41.098 --> 44:44.309
And then 50% is Margaret.

44:45.435 --> 44:47.271
You don't know anything about her.

44:47.354 --> 44:49.731
You don't know what she wantsor what she likes,

44:49.815 --> 44:52.693
so you have to talk to her.

44:53.819 --> 44:55.195
Try super hard to know.

44:55.779 --> 44:56.947
Are there any more lessons?

44:57.030 --> 44:58.031
Yes, there are.

44:58.115 --> 45:02.995
There are five-- four lessonson how to have the best first smooch.

45:13.547 --> 45:15.632
Hey, do you see a lot of Lola at school?

45:15.716 --> 45:18.218
Yeah. I have English with her this year.Why?

45:18.302 --> 45:21.263
I don't know. I just think you guys shouldbe really nice to her. Bullies suck.

45:21.346 --> 45:24.433
And I feel like it'd do a lotif cute boys were really nice to her.

45:24.516 --> 45:27.477
That guy is a dick to us too.He and his two friends bully everybody.

45:27.561 --> 45:29.062
Who? Gavin?

45:29.146 --> 45:31.899
-Yeah.-Well, maybe you guys should beat him up.

45:31.982 --> 45:34.860
I'm definitely gonnabeat Gavin's ass one day.

45:43.660 --> 45:44.661
That's bacon and eggs.

45:49.875 --> 45:51.126
You're dating him.

45:53.337 --> 45:54.838
Trying to ease me into it?

45:56.465 --> 45:57.716
Honestly, thank you.

46:05.682 --> 46:09.269
You, like, trainingfor a big bicep contest?

46:14.024 --> 46:15.776
I don't want to do that anymore.

46:17.277 --> 46:18.529
You can do more.

46:19.571 --> 46:20.989
You can do more.

46:21.073 --> 46:24.326
Oh, no, I can't. I can't do more.I'm not that guy.

46:25.118 --> 46:26.620
You're not that guy, pal.

46:26.703 --> 46:27.704
Fuck!

46:27.788 --> 46:29.790
Oh, God.

46:31.124 --> 46:32.543
I'm not a push-up guy.

46:36.129 --> 46:37.548
I'm not a sit-up guy either.

46:39.883 --> 46:41.426
Why do you want this job?

46:42.928 --> 46:47.307
Well, hope loves a friend.

46:48.976 --> 46:52.229
Hope Loves a Friendis the name of our nonprofit, yeah.

46:52.312 --> 46:55.566
But why do you wanna join the teamas a communications associate?

46:55.649 --> 46:56.900
Yeah, sorry.

46:57.484 --> 47:00.320
I studied marketing at Tulane.

47:00.404 --> 47:05.826
And I have a lot of experiencewith social media design.

47:06.994 --> 47:10.497
And a lot of experience withCRM tools like Buffer and MailChimp.

47:10.581 --> 47:11.582
A lot of experience there.

47:12.791 --> 47:13.667
And…

47:15.252 --> 47:18.463
I don't know.I just wanna help make a difference

47:18.547 --> 47:22.759
with kids and young adultswhose parents are affected with ASL.

47:22.843 --> 47:25.179
You mean ALS.

47:30.017 --> 47:32.227
Pretty sure it's ASL.

47:34.980 --> 47:36.857
No, I'm kidding. Obviously, you're right.

47:41.111 --> 47:43.405
My dad has ALS.

47:45.616 --> 47:47.409
That's not true.I don't know why I just said that.

47:54.583 --> 47:56.543
-Hey.-Hey.

47:57.127 --> 47:58.337
How'd the interview go?

47:59.171 --> 48:04.218
I'm going to lean back into theMeat-Sticks, party-starting grind.

48:04.301 --> 48:06.053
Can you tell me the second lesson?

48:06.136 --> 48:07.721
The second lesson is…

48:07.804 --> 48:10.682
give her all of your attentionbecause that's all people want.

48:10.766 --> 48:12.017
That's pretty easy.

48:13.727 --> 48:15.270
Does that look good? Yes? That--

48:15.354 --> 48:17.189
-King. You're a king.-For the kids' side?

48:17.272 --> 48:18.899
That's for the kids' side,then I'll lead the adults.

48:18.982 --> 48:21.527
Maybe we do a call and responsetype of thing. So it's--

48:21.610 --> 48:22.986
What if I was like…

48:24.071 --> 48:25.906
Your turn. Or something like that?

48:27.157 --> 48:32.287
Yes. Clap, clap. Yes!And then maybe you can invite, like--

48:32.371 --> 48:35.582
Like, invite one of your friends upto do a dance or something like that.

48:35.666 --> 48:36.750
Like Carter.

48:37.334 --> 48:39.878
I'm gonna be right back.You guys keep practicing.

48:39.962 --> 48:41.713
Nerves make you forget. Keep practicing.

48:41.797 --> 48:43.549
King. Big Baller Brand.

48:43.632 --> 48:44.925
Hey.

48:45.008 --> 48:46.009
Hi.

48:46.760 --> 48:50.514
I'm sorry. I lost the slip of paperthat had your number on it.

48:50.597 --> 48:53.100
I did. And I was thinkingof calling Lisa, your mom.

48:53.183 --> 48:56.228
I was, like, looking at the class list.And then I was like,

48:56.311 --> 49:00.858
"I'm not gonna be like, 'Hey,can you tell your son I lost his number?'"

49:01.859 --> 49:03.443
-So…-Where's Lola?

49:03.527 --> 49:06.488
She's actually aboutto walk in with Joseph.

49:07.614 --> 49:10.701
They are parking,and I said I had to pee really bad.

49:11.451 --> 49:12.578
But you wanted to warn me?

49:12.661 --> 49:14.663
No, I didn't wanna warn you.

49:14.746 --> 49:17.040
But, yeah, I did. I wanted to warn you.

49:17.124 --> 49:18.959
He doesn't know anythingthat would upset him.

49:19.042 --> 49:22.546
Well, yeah, the theme is"Sam goes viral. TikTok."

49:23.422 --> 49:24.423
-Yeah. Hi, guys.-Hi, Andrew.

49:24.506 --> 49:26.925
Hey, Lola. It is so nice to see you.

49:27.009 --> 49:28.594
-This is my fiancé, Jo---Joseph.

49:28.677 --> 49:30.220
-Glad to meet you.-Nice to meet you.

49:30.304 --> 49:32.181
Domino said youhelped out the other night.

49:32.264 --> 49:34.183
-I really appreciate that.-Oh, yeah.

49:34.266 --> 49:35.893
And you're our new sitter.

49:37.561 --> 49:40.480
Yes, I am. Uh-huh.

49:40.564 --> 49:43.317
And you're working tonight?I hear you're a great party starter.

49:43.400 --> 49:48.113
Yeah, well, um,I hear you're a great professional lawyer.

49:48.822 --> 49:51.950
-A busy one. I don't know about great.-Yeah. You out of town a lot?

49:52.743 --> 49:55.078
Yeah.Just a case in Chicago keeping me busy.

49:55.162 --> 49:57.456
Is your next case in Livingston?

49:58.040 --> 50:00.167
-I wish.-That would be great.

50:00.250 --> 50:02.085
All of his cases are in Chicago.

50:02.169 --> 50:04.463
I think we should move there.We're thinking about it.

50:04.546 --> 50:06.381
She wants to. I'd rather not.

50:07.424 --> 50:08.675
Well, where is the wedding?

50:08.759 --> 50:10.219
Here. Soon.

50:10.802 --> 50:12.638
-Should we---Yeah, totally. Likewise.

50:26.944 --> 50:27.945
Yeah!

50:39.414 --> 50:41.500
-Hi. Hey.-Hey.

50:42.251 --> 50:43.544
I got the sitter job?

50:44.461 --> 50:45.546
Yes.

50:45.629 --> 50:47.714
I'm so sorry. I just had to--

50:47.798 --> 50:51.093
Well, no. I'd love to, though.I haven't changed my mind.

50:52.261 --> 50:54.930
Okay. Well, I just thought that maybe…

50:56.682 --> 50:58.016
What?

50:58.100 --> 51:01.353
Nothing.I have a birthday party next week,

51:01.436 --> 51:04.898
that I would like to go to,but Joseph will be out of town.

51:04.982 --> 51:07.067
-I'm there. I'm absolutely there.-So…

51:07.150 --> 51:08.944
If Lola wants.

51:09.027 --> 51:11.280
Yeah. Of course, she does.She really likes you.

51:11.363 --> 51:12.781
I really like her.

51:17.744 --> 51:19.872
-I cannot see.-That's the point.

51:24.001 --> 51:26.211
How are you so fast at this game?

51:26.295 --> 51:28.046
A lot of practice.

51:29.214 --> 51:30.215
Yes.

51:30.299 --> 51:32.342
What is happening? What are you doing?

51:32.968 --> 51:34.386
No, we are not done.

51:34.469 --> 51:36.471
No! No!

51:38.098 --> 51:41.977
What is "farctate"? What is "farctate"?That is not a word. "Farctate"?

51:42.060 --> 51:43.395
It is a word.

51:43.478 --> 51:45.647
Well, use it in a sentence.

51:46.315 --> 51:49.401
It's a farctate board nowthat I've put those letters down.

51:49.484 --> 51:53.947
What, a fucked-up board?Like farctate-- Like you farted on it?

51:54.031 --> 51:58.035
No. It is filled.Farctate means to fill or stuff.

51:58.118 --> 52:00.287
It means full, as opposed to hollow.

52:00.370 --> 52:01.997
I don't believe you at all.

52:03.040 --> 52:07.961
And I'm going to provethat you are telling the truth.

52:08.045 --> 52:09.129
That is a word.

52:09.213 --> 52:12.049
I don't understand how you're so goodat this game.

52:12.549 --> 52:15.886
I'm not that good.I am just a lot better than you.

52:15.969 --> 52:16.970
Wow.

52:17.054 --> 52:20.182
Did you feed Jerry and brush your teeth?

52:20.265 --> 52:22.476
-Yes, of course.-Duh.

52:22.559 --> 52:26.647
Well, I'm sorry Mom isn't hereto scratch your back.

52:27.314 --> 52:30.984
Is there-- Can I, like,read you a story or something?

52:31.068 --> 52:34.738
Or, like, I can fall asleep on the floorwhile you fall asleep.

52:34.821 --> 52:36.949
I used to need my mom to read me a story.

52:37.032 --> 52:40.911
Then after that, she had to, like, sleepnext to me in order for me to fall asleep.

52:40.994 --> 52:44.623
I do not like that sort of thing.I do not mean to be brutal.

52:44.706 --> 52:46.875
No. No, no. It's not.

52:46.959 --> 52:49.336
I just wanna make sureyou're okay to fall asleep.

52:49.419 --> 52:51.213
I'm okay to fall asleep.

52:51.713 --> 52:52.714
Okay.

52:54.341 --> 52:55.384
Well, good night.

52:55.467 --> 52:56.802
Good night to you too, Andrew.

52:56.885 --> 52:58.887
And good night to you too, Jerry.

52:58.971 --> 53:00.556
Is mine blue?

53:01.139 --> 53:02.808
Yeah, it's super blue.

53:03.684 --> 53:04.768
How did that happen?

53:04.852 --> 53:05.978
Just normal.

53:07.229 --> 53:08.897
Do you want to know something?

53:09.481 --> 53:10.482
Yes.

53:10.983 --> 53:13.902
I'm having more fun nowthan I did the whole night.

53:15.028 --> 53:16.363
Did you have a bad night?

53:17.948 --> 53:19.324
No, it wasn't bad.

53:21.702 --> 53:23.120
Yeah, it was bad.

53:25.914 --> 53:27.374
I'm a bad person.

53:30.252 --> 53:31.962
I don't think you're a bad person.

53:35.966 --> 53:37.134
Let's trade.

53:37.968 --> 53:38.969
What?

53:40.470 --> 53:41.471
Okay.

53:51.899 --> 53:52.983
I have a question.

53:53.817 --> 53:55.861
-Have you ever been depressed?-Wow.

53:56.862 --> 53:57.863
Downer alert.

53:57.946 --> 54:01.241
You don't have to sound the downer alert.

54:01.325 --> 54:02.826
I'm just curious.

54:02.910 --> 54:04.286
I've always been depressed.

54:05.537 --> 54:06.622
Downer alert.

54:09.458 --> 54:10.876
Before Lola was born?

54:12.002 --> 54:13.837
Especially before Lola was born.

54:15.506 --> 54:17.299
Raising her made me better.

54:23.555 --> 54:25.265
What's it like being depressed?

54:27.059 --> 54:28.143
I don't know.

54:31.355 --> 54:32.856
It feels like…

54:34.441 --> 54:37.486
like you don't rememberwhat better feels like.

54:38.487 --> 54:43.534
And then you do things that you thinkwill make you feel better, but they don't.

54:43.617 --> 54:45.118
They make it worse.

54:47.162 --> 54:49.581
And the thingsthat I'm really scared of doing

54:49.665 --> 54:53.335
are probably the thingsthat will help me the most,

54:53.418 --> 54:55.671
but I just can't do them.

55:01.677 --> 55:03.679
My mom is bipolar…

55:04.847 --> 55:07.266
so she was really depressed a lotwhen I was a kid.

55:07.349 --> 55:10.644
And, I one time asked herthe same question

55:10.727 --> 55:13.730
and she said, "Sometimes it's just easierfor people to be sad."

55:15.107 --> 55:17.526
She tries though. Like, really tries.

55:19.945 --> 55:21.488
Everybody tries.

55:23.282 --> 55:27.327
I understand that depressionmakes your brain think things aren't true,

55:28.036 --> 55:33.709
but sometimes I just wish peoplelike my mom would listen to, like,

55:33.792 --> 55:35.961
people instead of her brain.

55:36.545 --> 55:38.755
And, like, good people, not shitty people.

55:42.676 --> 55:44.678
Do you know what you look like right now?

55:45.679 --> 55:46.680
No.

55:47.389 --> 55:50.058
You look like the sweetest person ever.

55:51.310 --> 55:54.563
-Do you know what you look like right now?-I don't want to know-- I don't care.

55:54.646 --> 55:56.106
I don't want to know.

55:57.316 --> 56:00.652
Everything feels so good right now.I don't want it to change.

56:01.570 --> 56:04.239
The only thing I would changeis that my elbows hurt.

56:04.323 --> 56:05.365
Your elbows hurt?

56:05.449 --> 56:07.868
Yeah, from leaning on them like that.

56:12.998 --> 56:14.041
Wow.

57:01.004 --> 57:02.256
Holy crap.

57:12.266 --> 57:14.268
I thought you were gonna be Greg.

57:14.810 --> 57:15.978
What?

57:16.061 --> 57:19.106
Hey,David doesn't like this cereal, does--

57:19.189 --> 57:20.399
Nope, just you.

57:24.069 --> 57:26.738
-Thank you.-You're welcome. What'd you do tonight?

57:28.073 --> 57:30.284
I was out with some high school friends.

57:33.287 --> 57:35.622
Are you planningfor your Spanish adventure?

57:35.706 --> 57:37.749
Because I am ready to help.

57:40.377 --> 57:44.673
I think Maya is dating someonein Barcelona.

57:52.806 --> 57:55.309
I didn't want to say this before,

57:55.392 --> 57:58.520
and I'm not just saying thisbecause I'm your mother,

57:58.604 --> 58:01.899
but you're way too good for herand everybody knows that.

58:02.691 --> 58:05.319
Literally everyone I know thinks that.

58:05.944 --> 58:06.987
Who?

58:07.070 --> 58:08.739
Everyone. Greg--

58:13.452 --> 58:16.205
-It's true though.-Greg told you that Maya was too good--

58:18.916 --> 58:22.085
It's true. We all know it's true.

58:22.169 --> 58:23.879
Fulbright scholar is--

58:23.962 --> 58:26.048
-Big dummies.-Dummies.

58:32.721 --> 58:34.598
Yes, I'm way too good for her.

58:36.808 --> 58:39.561
Your memories aren't going anywhere,by the way.

58:48.487 --> 58:51.156
I'm sorry. Growing up is hard.

58:52.783 --> 58:55.494
It's very overwhelming.I don't know how much I have left.

58:55.577 --> 58:56.662
I have so much, right?

58:58.121 --> 59:01.542
Not-- You know, not necessarily.

59:01.625 --> 59:02.626
You…

59:04.002 --> 59:06.713
You did a lot when you were young.

59:09.633 --> 59:10.676
Sorry.

59:11.969 --> 59:15.472
But I feel like you're wayahead of the game.

1:00:14.948 --> 1:00:16.450
Hi, Andrew.

1:00:16.533 --> 1:00:17.534
Hey.

1:00:18.327 --> 1:00:22.581
Guys, was it extra beautiful today?

1:00:22.664 --> 1:00:24.374
We were just talking about that.

1:00:24.458 --> 1:00:27.002
Yeah, sometimes I really envy Judaism.

1:00:27.085 --> 1:00:28.086
Same.

1:00:28.170 --> 1:00:30.672
And Nicky and his familywere so sweet. Don't you think?

1:00:30.756 --> 1:00:33.842
Yes. The parents. Oh, my God.They were literally to die for.

1:00:34.718 --> 1:00:37.387
Hey, will you sit for Lolathis week so I can take Domino out?

1:00:37.471 --> 1:00:40.891
Yes. Lo and I get to fricking party again?

1:00:40.974 --> 1:00:46.396
Well, I have four fourswhich puts me at, like, 195.

1:00:46.480 --> 1:00:49.775
I tried so hard to beat you.What is your secret?

1:00:49.858 --> 1:00:52.319
-I do not have any secrets.-Do you promise?

1:00:52.402 --> 1:00:54.112
-Yes.-Okay.

1:00:54.196 --> 1:00:58.992
Well,Lola kicks Andrew's ass one more time.

1:01:01.954 --> 1:01:04.289
What do you want to do now, party animal?

1:01:06.333 --> 1:01:08.126
I am not exactly sure.

1:01:08.210 --> 1:01:10.921
-Do you want some more food?-No, thank you.

1:01:15.717 --> 1:01:17.761
Do you like spending timewith me like this?

1:01:18.470 --> 1:01:20.973
I feel like it's taking a lot out of you,

1:01:21.056 --> 1:01:24.560
but I want you to know thatI can just sit here and, like, not talk.

1:01:25.269 --> 1:01:28.814
I can chill. I can be a chiller.I feel like I'm talking a lot.

1:01:31.316 --> 1:01:34.444
Sometimes it drains me a bit mentallyand physically

1:01:34.528 --> 1:01:36.697
when I spend a lot of time mingling.

1:01:37.531 --> 1:01:38.615
Okay, yeah.

1:01:39.741 --> 1:01:41.451
I'm sorry that I'm draining.

1:01:41.535 --> 1:01:43.537
How can I not be? How can I help that?

1:01:44.162 --> 1:01:46.790
You're probably not going to be able to.

1:01:48.208 --> 1:01:51.211
Sometimes I just needto recover in solitude.

1:01:51.712 --> 1:01:54.298
I actually enjoy being in an empty room.

1:01:56.383 --> 1:01:58.093
Well, I'm very jealous of that.

1:01:59.344 --> 1:02:00.762
Why are you jealous?

1:02:03.348 --> 1:02:06.685
Because I wish I enjoyed the companyof an empty room.

1:02:07.811 --> 1:02:09.855
Have you ever tried to enjoy it?

1:02:13.025 --> 1:02:15.694
"Have you ever tried to enjoy it?" No.

1:02:42.054 --> 1:02:45.432
I'm ready for bed and I do not mindyou scratching my back.

1:02:47.809 --> 1:02:50.103
I'm going to do my best Domino impression.

1:02:50.187 --> 1:02:51.730
Go like this.

1:02:52.814 --> 1:02:54.316
And go like that.

1:02:55.067 --> 1:02:56.443
-Like this?-Yeah.

1:02:56.527 --> 1:02:57.528
Okay.

1:02:58.153 --> 1:02:59.738
And go across.

1:02:59.821 --> 1:03:00.822
Like, across your back?

1:03:01.365 --> 1:03:02.366
Okay.

1:03:05.661 --> 1:03:07.579
-More pressure, please.-Okay.

1:03:39.653 --> 1:03:41.238
You're trash, kid.

1:03:47.411 --> 1:03:48.412
Hey.

1:03:49.538 --> 1:03:50.539
Fun night?

1:03:50.622 --> 1:03:51.915
Yep.

1:03:51.999 --> 1:03:55.669
Dinner and a movie and a… long ride home.

1:03:57.754 --> 1:03:59.715
We were just talking about you.

1:03:59.798 --> 1:04:02.634
Was saying to Domino that you,remind me of myself.

1:04:03.260 --> 1:04:04.553
That's interesting.

1:04:07.139 --> 1:04:09.016
-How?-How was Lola tonight?

1:04:09.099 --> 1:04:12.728
She's great. She was great.We played 500 Rummy.

1:04:12.811 --> 1:04:13.812
I love that game.

1:04:13.896 --> 1:04:15.189
Where are your socks, man?

1:04:18.609 --> 1:04:20.527
I… took them off.

1:04:20.611 --> 1:04:23.989
They're in my shoesbecause it was getting hot in here.

1:04:26.658 --> 1:04:28.160
It is really hot in here.

1:04:28.243 --> 1:04:31.538
Yeah, it was really hot at,like, 20 minutes ago, especially.

1:04:32.164 --> 1:04:33.707
Is that your shirt?

1:04:33.790 --> 1:04:36.376
-It is, actually, yeah.-Class of 2018?

1:04:38.587 --> 1:04:39.713
How old are you?

1:04:41.798 --> 1:04:43.675
I'm 22.

1:04:45.010 --> 1:04:47.554
I don't even remember being 22.

1:04:47.638 --> 1:04:49.473
I didn't realize you were that old.

1:04:52.351 --> 1:04:54.144
Lots to figure out after college.

1:04:56.480 --> 1:04:58.732
Yeah, lots to figure out, always.

1:04:58.815 --> 1:05:00.943
Want to help us figure out our stuff?

1:05:01.527 --> 1:05:02.528
I'm sorry?

1:05:02.611 --> 1:05:05.447
We've both had too much to drink.Andrew, I'm sorry.

1:05:05.531 --> 1:05:07.407
We're going to go to bed.

1:05:07.491 --> 1:05:10.577
Yeah, no worries at all. I'll leave you.

1:05:10.661 --> 1:05:13.580
-I still got to pay you for sitting.-No, it's fine. You can Venmo me.

1:05:13.664 --> 1:05:16.250
No, I got cash.

1:05:16.333 --> 1:05:17.376
Thank you.

1:05:18.752 --> 1:05:20.045
Good night, Domino.

1:05:26.051 --> 1:05:27.553
What's the third lesson?

1:05:27.636 --> 1:05:30.097
Be somewhere alone with her.

1:05:30.180 --> 1:05:32.599
Quiet. Other people around is bad news.

1:05:32.683 --> 1:05:35.185
So, say "Let's go somewhere quiet"?

1:05:35.269 --> 1:05:36.937
Where the fuck is my Meat Stick vest?

1:05:37.020 --> 1:05:39.273
-Don't you have multiple?-Yes. But one's in the hamper.

1:05:39.356 --> 1:05:41.608
I don't want to go to workwith a smelly-ass vest on.

1:05:41.692 --> 1:05:42.985
Can you help me for a second?

1:05:43.068 --> 1:05:45.320
It's somewhere in this room.Check my drawers or something.

1:05:50.784 --> 1:05:53.912
You should just, like, ask her to goto the water fountain with you.

1:05:53.996 --> 1:05:56.290
That's where I had my first kiss.You can, like--

1:05:56.373 --> 1:05:58.417
Or you could just not say anything,grab her hand

1:05:58.500 --> 1:06:00.377
and start walking with herand she'll be like,

1:06:00.460 --> 1:06:02.629
"Oh, my God. Are we aboutto have our first kiss right now?"

1:06:02.713 --> 1:06:06.466
-Won't that be creepy?-Yes. No, not if you pull it off.

1:06:06.550 --> 1:06:07.968
I don't think I can.

1:06:08.051 --> 1:06:11.805
Well, you won't with that attitude, David.Where is my Meat Stick vest?

1:06:28.697 --> 1:06:30.073
Hi, this is Andrew.

1:06:30.157 --> 1:06:31.950
Hey, this is Mr. Ron.

1:06:32.034 --> 1:06:35.287
I'm calling to offer you a jobat Hope Loves a Friend.

1:06:38.290 --> 1:06:39.291
Wow.

1:06:39.875 --> 1:06:42.169
I think today's my last day workingat Meat Sticks.

1:06:42.753 --> 1:06:46.465
Thank you so much. I'm so excited.Is this a prank?

1:06:46.548 --> 1:06:49.176
I'm done working at Meat Sticks

1:07:08.320 --> 1:07:10.030
Macy, what are you doing tonight?

1:07:44.606 --> 1:07:45.732
Excuse me, miss.

1:07:48.986 --> 1:07:49.903
Hello.

1:07:53.490 --> 1:07:54.491
Mist--

1:07:55.742 --> 1:07:56.743
Mister bar--

1:08:06.795 --> 1:08:08.005
What are you trying to get?

1:08:08.088 --> 1:08:10.174
Who is the discount Bradley Cooper?

1:08:11.675 --> 1:08:15.470
He's getting vodka sodasfor me and Lizzie.

1:08:16.345 --> 1:08:17.430
How was your play?

1:08:18.390 --> 1:08:20.434
It ended. And then we came here.

1:08:20.517 --> 1:08:21.518
Naturally.

1:08:22.102 --> 1:08:23.687
I'm not lying.

1:08:23.770 --> 1:08:25.189
I don't think you are.

1:08:27.024 --> 1:08:29.734
-Mister bartender.-Good. Great.

1:09:28.042 --> 1:09:29.252
What?

1:09:29.336 --> 1:09:30.921
I really want a cigarette.

1:09:31.671 --> 1:09:32.673
Have one.

1:09:33.423 --> 1:09:34.841
No, I quit.

1:09:38.720 --> 1:09:40.346
Who's with Lola tonight?

1:09:41.014 --> 1:09:42.390
My parents.

1:09:42.474 --> 1:09:44.977
-Where is your fiancé?-Chicago.

1:09:47.770 --> 1:09:49.398
Why is he your fiancé?

1:09:50.148 --> 1:09:52.024
Why is he my fiancé?

1:09:52.109 --> 1:09:56.363
Yeah. What's going on there in terms of,like, why he's your fiancé?

1:09:58.740 --> 1:09:59.867
You're drunk.

1:10:01.785 --> 1:10:03.453
You walked in a tilde out here.

1:10:03.537 --> 1:10:04.705
A tilde?

1:10:05.289 --> 1:10:08.917
Yeah,like the Spanish accent over the "n".

1:10:09.001 --> 1:10:10.377
I know what a tilde is.

1:10:10.460 --> 1:10:12.754
I know how to soft step.

1:10:13.255 --> 1:10:16.758
I just don't want to right now.I want to hear why you're getting married.

1:10:19.303 --> 1:10:21.096
Because I want commitment.

1:10:22.472 --> 1:10:24.016
It doesn't seem like that.

1:10:24.892 --> 1:10:26.143
I know.

1:10:28.687 --> 1:10:33.400
But I want to be firmly plantedin adult world.

1:10:34.443 --> 1:10:39.656
And I want to--I want everything else to be shut down.

1:10:40.532 --> 1:10:42.201
And I want to build something.

1:10:43.535 --> 1:10:44.953
Is he your soul mate?

1:10:46.038 --> 1:10:49.041
-Do you believe in soul mates?-Yeah, I do.

1:10:51.668 --> 1:10:55.631
I think, on the Earth, we all have,like, a ton of soul mates.

1:10:57.049 --> 1:11:00.385
I think for you, maybe it's likea special case where you only have a few…

1:11:02.221 --> 1:11:05.390
who, like, could beand really are your soul mates.

1:11:08.352 --> 1:11:10.687
But most of the peoplein the world aren't your soul mate.

1:11:10.771 --> 1:11:12.564
How many soul mates?

1:11:12.648 --> 1:11:14.608
For you, like, four.

1:11:14.691 --> 1:11:15.734
Four?

1:11:15.817 --> 1:11:18.529
-Yeah. Four soul mates.-I probably haven't met any of them.

1:11:18.612 --> 1:11:22.199
No, you have. God puts them, like,on your path so you'll cross.

1:11:22.282 --> 1:11:23.283
How many do you have?

1:11:23.992 --> 1:11:25.285
Like, 1,200.

1:11:27.829 --> 1:11:28.830
Have you met any?

1:11:28.914 --> 1:11:30.165
Yes.

1:11:34.670 --> 1:11:35.963
Domino.

1:11:39.091 --> 1:11:40.884
Oh, my God. That's a ton of blood.

1:11:43.887 --> 1:11:45.556
Why do you want to go to Chicago?

1:11:48.475 --> 1:11:51.270
Because I want change and…

1:11:53.856 --> 1:11:59.570
I think I want to go to college andthere are a lot more options in Chicago.

1:12:01.113 --> 1:12:04.449
And I just feel likemy whole life is happening there.

1:12:05.117 --> 1:12:08.161
-You should definitely go to college.-I knew you would say that.

1:12:08.245 --> 1:12:10.581
But you should go hereso Lola and I can hang out

1:12:10.664 --> 1:12:13.542
when you're busy studyingand doing your essays.

1:12:16.920 --> 1:12:20.674
I had this dream the other nightthat I was working on the common app.

1:12:21.758 --> 1:12:26.388
And Lola was there, and I couldn't focus.

1:12:26.471 --> 1:12:29.725
And then you came in and you were like,

1:12:29.808 --> 1:12:32.436
"Are you ready to turn it in?"And I just…

1:12:34.271 --> 1:12:35.272
freaked out.

1:12:35.355 --> 1:12:38.358
I was freaking outbecause I hadn't even started it.

1:12:40.068 --> 1:12:41.278
And then you were like…

1:12:43.739 --> 1:12:46.408
"It's okay. You have plenty of time.''

1:12:48.952 --> 1:12:50.913
And I had side-swept bangs.

1:12:54.833 --> 1:12:58.504
Did the side-swept bangs suck?Is that why you're tearing up right now?

1:13:05.719 --> 1:13:08.138
Do you know I was married to Lola's dad?

1:13:09.348 --> 1:13:10.349
No.

1:13:15.938 --> 1:13:17.147
He left.

1:13:23.362 --> 1:13:26.406
I want to thank youfor being so kind to Lola.

1:13:30.911 --> 1:13:32.412
Easiest thing in the world.

1:13:37.292 --> 1:13:39.336
I want you to be in Lola's life.

1:13:41.797 --> 1:13:44.633
But I don't want youto babysit for us anymore.

1:13:49.388 --> 1:13:50.389
Why?

1:13:52.599 --> 1:13:54.768
Because I want you to do your 20s.

1:14:05.904 --> 1:14:09.449
I feel like there are thingsthat you just, like, don't say to me.

1:14:12.536 --> 1:14:18.959
And I can't tell whether you're, like,holding back a desire to be close

1:14:19.042 --> 1:14:21.587
or a desire to be distant.

1:14:25.966 --> 1:14:28.594
For me,it's holding back a desire to be close.

1:15:07.674 --> 1:15:08.717
Oh, my God.

1:15:09.885 --> 1:15:12.304
You have to go.And you have to go out that door.

1:15:12.387 --> 1:15:13.680
Oh, fuck, he said tomorrow.

1:15:13.764 --> 1:15:15.682
-Domino, look at me for a second.-No.

1:15:25.275 --> 1:15:26.568
It's just me.

1:15:43.335 --> 1:15:44.336
Hey.

1:15:50.342 --> 1:15:51.593
How are your friends?

1:15:57.391 --> 1:15:59.393
I'm kissing Margs tomorrow.

1:16:01.854 --> 1:16:03.981
-Andrew?-That's great. That's awesome.

1:16:06.191 --> 1:16:08.735
Can you tell me the other lessons?

1:16:08.819 --> 1:16:10.737
No. Not right now.

1:16:11.446 --> 1:16:12.698
What?

1:16:12.781 --> 1:16:13.615
Why?

1:16:13.699 --> 1:16:15.784
Because I don't have any lessons.

1:16:15.868 --> 1:16:18.829
Every time you asked me for a lesson,I just pulled something out of my ass.

1:16:18.912 --> 1:16:20.789
And I don't want to do that right now.

1:16:21.623 --> 1:16:25.961
Wait. So you've been messing with me?

1:16:26.044 --> 1:16:29.214
David, can you please fuck off right now?I don't want to talk.

1:16:29.298 --> 1:16:31.884
I don't have any lessons.I don't know shit.

1:16:37.139 --> 1:16:39.725
I guess I don't knowwhy I thought you know shit.

1:16:39.808 --> 1:16:41.560
You don't even have a girlfriend.

1:16:42.102 --> 1:16:45.397
You want to get your ass kickedright now? Is that why you said that?

1:16:45.480 --> 1:16:47.941
-That's not funny.-I'm not trying to be funny.

1:16:48.650 --> 1:16:50.402
You're not the only one who can be mean.

1:16:51.820 --> 1:16:54.865
You're not mean, David.You're just really fucking annoying.

1:17:25.979 --> 1:17:27.022
Hi, Andrew.

1:17:27.105 --> 1:17:28.941
What's up, chiller? Hey, Joseph.

1:17:29.024 --> 1:17:30.359
Hey.

1:17:31.401 --> 1:17:33.278
Hey, can you hold another thing right now?

1:17:33.904 --> 1:17:36.156
It depends on what that thing is.

1:17:36.240 --> 1:17:38.033
All right. Wait right there. Hold on.

1:17:38.116 --> 1:17:39.326
What is it?

1:17:39.409 --> 1:17:40.661
It is…

1:17:42.496 --> 1:17:45.165
You know, just a MoYu 13-by-13.

1:17:45.249 --> 1:17:47.668
It's for you, it's yours.

1:17:48.627 --> 1:17:50.629
Thank you very much for this.

1:17:51.129 --> 1:17:53.048
You sure you can hold it? Yes, you can.

1:17:53.131 --> 1:17:55.509
That's really kind of you, Andrew.

1:17:56.510 --> 1:17:58.929
Hey, Lola, why don't yougo sit at that table over there

1:17:59.012 --> 1:18:01.515
and claim our territorybefore everybody gets here.

1:18:05.310 --> 1:18:07.688
Listen, we haven't told Lola yet,

1:18:07.771 --> 1:18:10.065
but we're not gonna need youto babysit anymore.

1:18:10.899 --> 1:18:11.900
Why?

1:18:12.651 --> 1:18:14.194
Lots of reasons.

1:18:15.070 --> 1:18:17.197
One of them being I finished my trial.

1:18:17.281 --> 1:18:18.532
We settled.

1:18:18.615 --> 1:18:19.616
Congratulations.

1:18:19.700 --> 1:18:22.661
Yeah. So, I'm actually gonnabe taking some time off.

1:18:22.744 --> 1:18:25.372
We won't need a sitter anymore.

1:18:27.875 --> 1:18:29.376
Where's Domino right now?

1:18:29.960 --> 1:18:30.961
She's at home.

1:18:33.630 --> 1:18:34.756
Is she okay?

1:18:34.840 --> 1:18:37.467
Yeah, she just didn't feel like comingto a party tonight.

1:18:39.720 --> 1:18:41.430
Why are you so fucking vague, man?

1:18:41.513 --> 1:18:44.224
-What?-Is she, like, sick or what?

1:18:44.308 --> 1:18:48.353
Look, Mr. Schindler's looking over herelike he wants you to get back to your job.

1:18:48.437 --> 1:18:51.857
I'm going to let you do that.I'm gonna go sit with Lola.

1:18:56.278 --> 1:19:00.532
Could you do me a solid?Could you pour me, like, a straight water?

1:19:00.616 --> 1:19:02.326
And by water I mean vodka.

1:19:09.750 --> 1:19:10.876
Stepdad Greg.

1:19:10.959 --> 1:19:14.671
Hey. I just showed upwith your mom and brother.

1:19:16.256 --> 1:19:18.258
Well,I didn't think you were showing up alone

1:19:18.342 --> 1:19:20.469
to Benjamin Schindler's bar mitzvah party.

1:19:20.552 --> 1:19:24.264
I hear we're driving you homebecause you Ubered. Is that right?

1:19:24.348 --> 1:19:26.058
That's right. Yes.

1:19:26.141 --> 1:19:30.145
Although I feel like allthat Uber money might be worth it

1:19:30.229 --> 1:19:32.731
to not smell that fish in your car.

1:19:34.316 --> 1:19:36.318
-What fish?-I have no idea.

1:19:36.401 --> 1:19:39.488
I assumed you had many fish in your car.

1:19:39.571 --> 1:19:43.033
-Did you put fish in my car?-No, man, your car just reeks.

1:19:44.284 --> 1:19:45.327
All right, Andrew.

1:19:46.078 --> 1:19:49.248
Have a nice nightmaking certain people feel happy.

1:19:49.331 --> 1:19:51.458
Have a nice night hating your life.

1:19:53.669 --> 1:19:54.962
Are you drunk right now, son?

1:19:55.045 --> 1:19:57.714
I am. Yes. Sir, yes, sir.

1:19:59.508 --> 1:20:00.592

1:20:03.470 --> 1:20:06.306
Doping.Tell him his kid's party's gonna be lit.

1:20:06.390 --> 1:20:10.269
Yeah, I'm going to tell himhis kid's party starter was doping.

1:20:10.352 --> 1:20:12.271
What? You stink.

1:20:12.354 --> 1:20:13.647
Nah, you stink.

1:20:13.730 --> 1:20:15.816
You stink. You have a job to do right now.

1:20:15.899 --> 1:20:19.027
Well, Mr. Schindler'swearing a clown costume, so.

1:20:19.111 --> 1:20:22.322

1:20:30.998 --> 1:20:34.626
I'm really sorry about last night.I need advice. I'm really nervous.

1:20:35.919 --> 1:20:38.463
Everybody's nervous.You got it. I got to go.

1:20:42.801 --> 1:20:46.513
Hello, everybody.Are you guys ready for a circus?

1:20:47.723 --> 1:20:49.808
You ready for some music? All right.

1:20:49.892 --> 1:20:52.895
I know how hard it is for some of youto get on the dance floor,

1:20:52.978 --> 1:20:54.521
but the way we're going to start tonight

1:20:54.605 --> 1:20:57.774
is everybody is gonna dothe Cha Cha Slide.

1:20:57.858 --> 1:21:00.903
Every single person. No exceptions.

1:21:01.695 --> 1:21:03.322
I'm literally not going to start the song

1:21:03.405 --> 1:21:06.158
until every single person ison the dance floor.

1:21:16.043 --> 1:21:19.463
Hey. Do you want to walk with meto the water fountain

1:21:19.546 --> 1:21:21.465

1:21:23.842 --> 1:21:24.843
Yeah.

1:21:31.058 --> 1:21:35.020
Are we just getting water,or should we hang out back here?

1:21:36.563 --> 1:21:38.732
We can hang out back here.

1:21:55.916 --> 1:21:57.334
How was your soccer game?

1:21:58.126 --> 1:21:59.127
Good. We won.

1:22:00.003 --> 1:22:01.296
Congratulations.

1:22:02.339 --> 1:22:04.716
I scored a goal for you.

1:22:06.593 --> 1:22:07.678
That's nice.

1:22:09.555 --> 1:22:12.766
-That's a really nice necklace.-Whose cube is that?

1:22:12.850 --> 1:22:14.893
Do you want to…

1:22:15.978 --> 1:22:17.187
Kiss?

1:22:17.271 --> 1:22:18.897

1:22:19.648 --> 1:22:21.191
-Come on. Give it.-No.

1:22:21.275 --> 1:22:22.526
What are you looking at?

1:22:22.609 --> 1:22:24.152
Hey.

1:22:24.236 --> 1:22:26.029

-Give her her stuff back.-Get off.

1:22:52.806 --> 1:22:53.849
Oh, shit, Rodrigo.

1:22:53.932 --> 1:22:55.267
Fuck head.

1:22:56.268 --> 1:22:58.520
Guys, guys, guys.

1:22:59.104 --> 1:23:00.355
-Are you okay?-Hey!

1:23:00.439 --> 1:23:01.940
Relax, relax. Relax.

1:23:02.024 --> 1:23:03.108
-Hey!-Goddamn it.

1:23:04.276 --> 1:23:06.111
Hey, don't push my mom.

1:23:08.488 --> 1:23:09.948
Yo, what the hell?

1:23:10.032 --> 1:23:11.033
Hey.

1:23:12.868 --> 1:23:13.869
Damn.

1:23:17.581 --> 1:23:21.251
Andrew, there are boundariesthat come with a professional gig.

1:23:21.335 --> 1:23:23.545
Every profession has those boundaries.

1:23:24.171 --> 1:23:27.966
Okay, but the way you putthat man to sleep, stepdad Greg.

1:23:28.050 --> 1:23:29.718
Andrew, this isn't funny.

1:23:29.801 --> 1:23:31.470
Mom, I'm sorry that you got slugged,

1:23:31.553 --> 1:23:34.890
but those kids that Rodrigoand David were fighting are pricks.

1:23:34.973 --> 1:23:37.351
Every kid in their gradeis going to sleep very well tonight,

1:23:37.434 --> 1:23:40.395
knowing they got their asses kicked.Along with that prick dad.

1:23:40.479 --> 1:23:42.523
-Now they won't fuck with people.-The language.

1:23:42.606 --> 1:23:44.608
Yeah. It was worth it, Mom and Greg.

1:23:44.691 --> 1:23:47.611
Yeah, I've been waitingto kick their asses for three years now.

1:23:47.694 --> 1:23:48.737
Unbelievable.

1:23:48.820 --> 1:23:51.532
And, Greg, that was the meanest right hookI've ever seen, my boy.

1:23:51.615 --> 1:23:54.243
Yeah, Greg.I did not know you could move like that.

1:23:54.326 --> 1:23:56.119
What are you, Jake Paul?

1:24:01.208 --> 1:24:05.045
I knew you would like that one, dog.He literally fell asleep.

1:24:07.172 --> 1:24:09.007
Well, no one hits your mother.

1:24:17.599 --> 1:24:19.101
Mom, it's not on the table.

1:24:19.184 --> 1:24:21.311
-Did you look in my bag?-Yes, it's not there.

1:24:21.395 --> 1:24:23.230
I don't know.Maybe it's on my bedside table.

1:24:23.313 --> 1:24:24.314
Okay.

1:24:24.398 --> 1:24:26.692
Look, I really don't want youto drive right now.

1:24:26.775 --> 1:24:29.695
-Greg, I had one drink.-Where are you going?

1:24:29.778 --> 1:24:31.822
I'm going to my friend's housebecause she's sick

1:24:31.905 --> 1:24:34.157
-and I want to go check on her.-Why are you in such a hurry?

1:24:34.241 --> 1:24:36.952
I'm not in a hurry. You need toput ice on that. It looks horrible.

1:24:37.035 --> 1:24:38.495
David, can you come upstairs with me?

1:24:38.579 --> 1:24:41.415
And, you guys, ice your fists.

1:24:41.498 --> 1:24:42.916
'Cause of your punches.

1:24:43.542 --> 1:24:45.169
-Yes, sir.-Yes, sir.

1:24:45.252 --> 1:24:46.670
David, come up here.

1:24:50.382 --> 1:24:53.343
I'm really sorry.I was having a bad 24 hours.

1:24:54.970 --> 1:24:58.098
-It's okay.-It's not okay, but I'm really sorry.

1:25:00.267 --> 1:25:02.728
-Did you have your first kiss tonight?-No.

1:25:02.811 --> 1:25:04.104
You didn't? That's good.

1:25:04.188 --> 1:25:07.191
That's actually really, really goodbecause I realized something.

1:25:08.025 --> 1:25:10.027
My lessons sucked.

1:25:10.110 --> 1:25:11.612
They were, like, super misleading.

1:25:11.695 --> 1:25:13.822
I kept telling youthat it was all about Margaret

1:25:13.906 --> 1:25:15.908
and about, like,giving her all your attention,

1:25:16.867 --> 1:25:19.828
but I forgot to say that you haveto pay attention to yourself too.

1:25:21.038 --> 1:25:24.249
It's not easy, like we were saying.It's actually really hard.

1:25:25.459 --> 1:25:27.878
Because you've got to gofor what you want, too.

1:25:29.129 --> 1:25:30.881
Kissing is for two people to enjoy.

1:25:34.134 --> 1:25:35.219
I got to go.

1:25:36.970 --> 1:25:39.556
Really awesome shit tonight.

1:25:39.640 --> 1:25:41.808
I'm so proud to be your big brother.

1:25:43.227 --> 1:25:44.436
Love you.

1:25:44.520 --> 1:25:46.396
-Andrew?-Yes. What?

1:25:48.690 --> 1:25:49.691
Good luck.

1:25:50.692 --> 1:25:51.693
Thank you.

1:26:04.540 --> 1:26:05.582
Hey.

1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:08.877
-Hi.-Hi.

1:26:10.128 --> 1:26:11.171
Are you sick?

1:26:11.255 --> 1:26:13.423
No, I just didn't want to go to the party.

1:26:13.507 --> 1:26:16.009
What are you-- It's not over.

1:26:16.093 --> 1:26:17.177
It's not.

1:26:17.261 --> 1:26:19.388
I just wanted to comeand tell you something

1:26:19.471 --> 1:26:22.432
'cause I feel like I'm not goingto get another chance to tell you…

1:26:23.141 --> 1:26:26.770
that I feel likeyou don't want to get married.

1:26:26.854 --> 1:26:28.355
So, I don't think that you should.

1:26:30.524 --> 1:26:31.733
And I love you.

1:26:33.110 --> 1:26:35.320
-You don't love me.-Yeah, I do.

1:26:38.991 --> 1:26:41.451
And more than anything,I just want you to be happy.

1:26:45.622 --> 1:26:46.832
I am happy.

1:26:51.503 --> 1:26:55.591
When I'm with you, I feel so… alive,

1:26:55.674 --> 1:26:57.426
and I feel so special.

1:26:59.136 --> 1:27:00.512
But that's because it's all…

1:27:03.098 --> 1:27:04.349
possibility.

1:27:07.311 --> 1:27:09.146
We're not in a relationship.

1:27:09.229 --> 1:27:12.024
-But what if we were in a relationship?-I don't know.

1:27:14.610 --> 1:27:19.072
And I don't want to knowbecause you are 22,

1:27:20.032 --> 1:27:22.534
and you deserve so much more than this.

1:27:22.618 --> 1:27:24.912
You can't just decidethat you love somebody,

1:27:24.995 --> 1:27:27.080
and then that's that,and everything's great.

1:27:27.164 --> 1:27:28.790
-Yes, you can.-No, you can't.

1:27:28.874 --> 1:27:31.710
Yes, you can. You can.

1:27:36.173 --> 1:27:38.550
You don't even know who you are yet.

1:27:40.511 --> 1:27:42.846
Giving your heart to somebody is…

1:27:44.223 --> 1:27:45.849
the scariest,

1:27:46.683 --> 1:27:47.976
most dangerous,

1:27:49.520 --> 1:27:52.314
most perplexing thing.

1:27:53.690 --> 1:27:56.026
What if we just kiss?Maybe you'll change your mind.

1:27:59.863 --> 1:28:00.864
No.

1:28:04.159 --> 1:28:06.161
I want to marry him.

1:28:07.663 --> 1:28:09.581
I do. I really want to marry him,

1:28:09.665 --> 1:28:15.462
and I know that it doesn't seem like thatbecause of what I do, but I want that.

1:28:15.546 --> 1:28:17.840
It's just that I'm so scared…

1:28:20.384 --> 1:28:21.969
because the first one left.

1:28:22.052 --> 1:28:23.053
He left me.

1:28:29.351 --> 1:28:32.604
Marrying Joseph is the thingthat will help you the most.

1:28:32.688 --> 1:28:34.022
What?

1:28:34.106 --> 1:28:37.776
The other night you said that the thingsthat really scare you are the things

1:28:37.860 --> 1:28:39.611
that are gonna help you the most.

1:28:39.695 --> 1:28:41.488
I had thought that you were--

1:28:43.115 --> 1:28:45.200
I thought that you were talking about me.

1:28:47.160 --> 1:28:49.621
Because I'm an idiot.

1:29:24.281 --> 1:29:25.449
I'm really sorry.

1:29:25.532 --> 1:29:27.034
Roll the window down.

1:29:30.370 --> 1:29:32.956
I'm really sorry, man. I'm a dumb kid.

1:29:33.040 --> 1:29:35.709
I know. It's okay.

1:29:39.463 --> 1:29:41.423
Thanks for looking out for Lola tonight.

1:29:43.342 --> 1:29:44.927
Andrew, look at me for a second.

1:29:46.303 --> 1:29:47.971
Thanks for looking out for my family.

1:29:49.473 --> 1:29:51.391
-You good to drive?-Yeah.

1:30:10.035 --> 1:30:11.745
I'm drunk, now.

1:30:32.933 --> 1:30:38.230
Mom, can you pick me upin Greg's car right now?

1:30:40.399 --> 1:30:44.611
Yeah, I'm safe.Everything is just, like, a mess.

1:31:09.928 --> 1:31:11.680
-Hi.-Andrew, this is Ashlin.

1:31:11.763 --> 1:31:15.142
I've heard so many things about you.I hear you're a…

1:32:16.119 --> 1:32:17.871
-Hello?-Hey, it's me.

1:32:19.081 --> 1:32:22.417
I got off early. Can I get David?

1:32:23.043 --> 1:32:24.253
Yeah.

1:32:24.336 --> 1:32:26.088
-Are your keys in here?-Yeah.

1:32:28.549 --> 1:32:29.550
Mother.

1:32:30.175 --> 1:32:31.969
Can I tell you something?

1:32:35.597 --> 1:32:37.724
I'm really sorry I gave youthat black eye,

1:32:37.808 --> 1:32:40.686
is the first thing I wanted to say.It looks really cool, though.

1:32:42.062 --> 1:32:43.772
And I also want to tell you

1:32:43.856 --> 1:32:46.608
that I have decidedI'm not going to Barcelona.

1:32:49.319 --> 1:32:51.613
But I do think I'm gonna move out soon.

1:32:53.323 --> 1:32:54.950
I realize I have enough money.

1:32:56.618 --> 1:32:58.537
But I don't thinkI'm going to move very far.

1:33:02.499 --> 1:33:04.084
That sounds great, babe.

1:33:08.839 --> 1:33:11.967
I've been passing our old houseon the way to work.

1:33:12.050 --> 1:33:13.510
Like, I walk by it every day.

1:33:14.303 --> 1:33:16.180
-You have?-Yes.

1:33:18.056 --> 1:33:20.893
And I feel really happyevery time I pass it.

1:33:23.228 --> 1:33:25.147
And I just want you to know that.

1:33:28.442 --> 1:33:31.778
Like, I have this urge to tell youthat I had a really great childhood.

1:33:32.362 --> 1:33:34.907
And I think you're a really great mother.

1:33:34.990 --> 1:33:37.159
I hope you know that. I think that.

1:33:41.330 --> 1:33:43.582
And I also really love your new house.

1:33:43.665 --> 1:33:45.834
And I'm really happy that you're happy.

1:33:47.920 --> 1:33:49.713
Are you trying to kill me?

1:33:53.967 --> 1:33:55.010
Yes.

1:34:19.493 --> 1:34:20.702
Yeah. Come here.

1:34:38.804 --> 1:34:39.930
-Hey.-Hi.

1:34:41.807 --> 1:34:44.685
For some reason, I was afraidI was never going to see you again.

1:34:44.768 --> 1:34:49.439
Well, I usually don't pick up David.But today I got off work early, so…

1:34:57.281 --> 1:35:00.117
You really caught meoff guard the other night.

1:35:00.200 --> 1:35:03.745
I just didn't have a chance to thinkabout what I wanted to say to you.

1:35:05.956 --> 1:35:08.959
It's not justthat I'm afraid of commitment

1:35:09.042 --> 1:35:10.794
because I've been left before.

1:35:11.753 --> 1:35:13.881
It's becauseyou're deeply in love with me?

1:35:14.631 --> 1:35:15.632
Yeah.

1:35:18.886 --> 1:35:21.597
But what I was gonna say is that…

1:35:22.681 --> 1:35:25.017
it is really hard for me

1:35:25.100 --> 1:35:29.938
to accept the fact thatuntil I leave Earth,

1:35:30.981 --> 1:35:35.986
I'm gonna have always been so tangled.

1:35:40.240 --> 1:35:42.576
She came when I was so young.

1:35:43.410 --> 1:35:44.411
And…

1:35:47.122 --> 1:35:52.169
then everything from therewas defined by her stages.

1:35:53.587 --> 1:35:57.257
And then Joseph came along,and I'm so thankful, but…

1:35:58.717 --> 1:36:02.804
for the rest of my life,everything is going to be defined by them.

1:36:05.265 --> 1:36:06.475
But you,

1:36:08.310 --> 1:36:09.811
you only have you.

1:36:10.979 --> 1:36:14.983
And how scary but how amazing.

1:36:16.401 --> 1:36:19.196
You can just figure things out,

1:36:19.279 --> 1:36:22.658
and you don't have to worryabout bringing another person into it.

1:36:25.327 --> 1:36:29.957
Yeah, I think you're so great.

1:36:32.417 --> 1:36:34.253
I'm really sorry that--

1:36:34.336 --> 1:36:35.587
It's okay.

1:36:46.473 --> 1:36:48.809
-Well, dang, this sucks.-What does?

1:36:48.892 --> 1:36:51.228
You just gave me, like,your farewell speech.

1:36:51.311 --> 1:36:52.896
So this means we're saying goodbye.

1:37:13.458 --> 1:37:14.751
I should go.

1:37:14.835 --> 1:37:17.379
David doesn't think that I'm parking,

1:37:17.462 --> 1:37:19.548
so I should get in the carpool line.

1:37:21.216 --> 1:37:22.509
And I don't want to see Lola.

1:37:22.593 --> 1:37:25.637
I realized the other dayI probably won't see her much anymore,

1:37:25.721 --> 1:37:27.723
and that makes a lot of sense to me.

1:37:28.765 --> 1:37:30.726
Yeah, but that makes me really sad.

1:37:30.809 --> 1:37:32.186
Yeah, it makes me--

1:37:34.521 --> 1:37:36.190
makes me really sad too.

1:37:36.273 --> 1:37:37.858
Gosh, you're really sweet.

1:37:37.941 --> 1:37:40.194
No, I'm not. I just really love you guys.

1:37:42.946 --> 1:37:45.032
But my memories aren't going anywhere.

1:37:46.783 --> 1:37:47.993
Neither will mine.

1:37:50.537 --> 1:37:51.997
Neither will hers.

1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:56.418
Okay, well.

1:37:58.253 --> 1:37:59.254
Bye.

1:38:05.969 --> 1:38:07.387
-Wait. Hold on.-Yes?

1:38:07.471 --> 1:38:12.893
I was gonna tryand get you this card.

1:38:12.976 --> 1:38:15.270
I was going to mail it and then…

1:38:17.231 --> 1:38:19.149
-I don't have---You don't have my address.

1:38:19.233 --> 1:38:21.485
No,I don't really know anything about you.

1:38:22.653 --> 1:38:23.737
But you can have it.

1:38:23.820 --> 1:38:25.072
Thank you.

1:38:28.325 --> 1:38:30.494
By the way, I do think I'm a soul mate.

1:38:32.246 --> 1:38:34.164
But I know that Joseph is too.

1:39:56.371 --> 1:39:57.831
Do you want to talk about it?

1:39:59.541 --> 1:40:03.128
No, not right now. Maybe later.Thank you for asking.

1:40:04.379 --> 1:40:06.548
Well, I'm--I'll probably end up doing homework

1:40:06.632 --> 1:40:09.885
at the dining room table,so whenever you're ready.

1:40:13.597 --> 1:40:16.016
David, I want to be friends forever, okay?

1:40:16.725 --> 1:40:17.726
Okay.

1:40:19.228 --> 1:40:21.438
Can I tell you something sad, though?

1:40:21.522 --> 1:40:24.816
I think I'm not going to be livingin your room much longer.

1:40:24.900 --> 1:40:28.237
I think it's probably timeI find my own place, right?

1:40:29.363 --> 1:40:33.367
Yeah. I mean, that's probably right.It's a pretty tight space.

1:40:33.867 --> 1:40:36.578
Yes, it is a very tight space.

1:40:38.872 --> 1:40:40.707
Did you talk to Margaret today?

1:40:42.876 --> 1:40:45.879
Yeah. We did some talking.

1:40:49.550 --> 1:40:53.303
What? Shut your ass up right now!Did you have your first kiss today?

1:40:54.930 --> 1:40:58.559
You had your first kiss today.What are you talking about right now?

1:40:58.642 --> 1:41:00.894
At school? Oh, my God.

1:41:00.978 --> 1:41:03.438
Okay, so we're-- You're--We're getting home right now.

1:41:03.522 --> 1:41:06.108
You're going to do your homeworkso freaking fast,

1:41:06.191 --> 1:41:08.694
and then you're going to tell meevery single solitary detail.

1:41:08.777 --> 1:41:10.904
And then we're going to breakinto Greg's secret fridge

1:41:10.988 --> 1:41:12.531
and pop some bottles before he gets home.

1:41:45.272 --> 1:41:46.481
Why do you look upset?

1:41:47.274 --> 1:41:48.483
Why do you look upset?

1:41:50.777 --> 1:41:51.778
What's going on?

1:41:55.824 --> 1:41:58.994
I think I'm a little heartbroken too.

1:41:59.077 --> 1:42:01.747
What? Margaret?

1:42:02.497 --> 1:42:03.665
No, no. It's…

1:42:05.083 --> 1:42:06.668
I'm going to miss you.

1:42:20.557 --> 1:42:22.434
I'm gonna miss you too, man.
