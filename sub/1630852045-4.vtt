00:09.343 --> 00:11.637
You ever have one of those days

00:11.720 --> 00:14.932
where you feel like
the whole world is against you?

00:17.392 --> 00:19.436
You know what I'm talking about.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.860
First woman in space, huh?

00:26.944 --> 00:29.988
Yep. Bella Borisovna.
She's gonna be on TV tonight.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.991
Makes me feel like I can do anything.

00:33.825 --> 00:35.827
Rats! I better take the train.

00:41.500 --> 00:44.253
No money, no subway. Keep moving. Come on.

00:44.336 --> 00:46.922
How about giving me a dime?

00:47.005 --> 00:48.298
Get outta here, kid!

00:54.221 --> 00:57.474
Excuse me, Mrs. Garcia. Do you have
a dime I can borrow for the train?

00:59.643 --> 01:01.144
-What?
-Mud.

01:02.312 --> 01:03.313
Go!

01:04.272 --> 01:06.233
I think I have a quarter.

01:06.316 --> 01:08.110
Nope, it's a Canadian loonie.

01:08.193 --> 01:12.781
-You see, I just got back from Montreal--
-I don't have time for loonies!

01:15.659 --> 01:18.954
Fine, I'll just run home.
One foot in front of the other.

01:20.122 --> 01:22.457
Hey, watch where you're going, kid.

01:23.458 --> 01:25.586
What else could go wrong?

01:39.391 --> 01:42.352
Harriet! What have I told you
about running in the house?

01:42.436 --> 01:45.522
I know. But I just had the worst day ever,

01:45.606 --> 01:48.025
and I just wanna see
the lady cosmonaut on TV.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.568
No excuses, young lady.

01:49.651 --> 01:52.821
I want you to march upstairs
to your room right now.

01:55.824 --> 02:02.039
Up in the vastness of space,
you feel truly alone, truly at peace.

02:02.122 --> 02:05.417
Truly alone, truly at peace.

02:06.210 --> 02:08.836
After a day like this, all I can say is--

02:08.920 --> 02:11.131
I said no TV, Harriet.

02:11.632 --> 02:14.635
Outer space, here I come.

02:15.177 --> 02:17.846
I just wanna be
You just wanna be

02:17.930 --> 02:19.806
We just wanna be

02:20.766 --> 02:23.352
I am gonna be who I wanna be

02:23.435 --> 02:25.270
My autonomy

02:25.354 --> 02:28.273
No, I won't cut my hair

02:28.357 --> 02:30.817
And I'll wear whatever

02:30.901 --> 02:36.907
I like it when I get to be myself

02:36.990 --> 02:39.660
I don't wanna be
You don't wanna be

02:39.743 --> 02:42.538
We don't wanna be told what to do

02:48.544 --> 02:50.045
Harriet, what's wrong?

02:51.129 --> 02:52.923
The whole world.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.926
Well, that and maybe
I ran in the house again

02:56.009 --> 02:58.512
and broke a ton of plates,
and now Mom's super mad.

02:58.595 --> 03:02.432
But, Ole Golly, can you talk to her
so I won't be in trouble?

03:02.516 --> 03:05.561
Then I could still watch
the lady cosmonaut. Please?

03:06.061 --> 03:08.897
I will do no such thing,
Harriet M. Welsch.

03:08.981 --> 03:12.109
You've got to start looking out for people
besides yourself.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.570
Why? Nobody's looking out for me.

03:14.653 --> 03:16.530
That's simply untrue.

03:17.573 --> 03:21.368
And besides, being sent to one's room
is good for creativity.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.161
Ask Virginia Woolf.

03:23.245 --> 03:29.334
"There is no gate, no lock, no bolt
that can set upon the freedom of my mind."

03:29.918 --> 03:34.339
Quotes? At a time like this?
I'm better-off in my room.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.890
I was not better-off in my room.

03:42.973 --> 03:47.352
I was so mad, I couldn't sleep.
Mom and Ole Golly were in cahoots.

03:47.436 --> 03:49.813
It's a wonder
I have any plates left at all.

03:49.897 --> 03:53.108
She treats our home like it's
the running of the bulls.

03:53.192 --> 03:55.068
Enough about the plates.

03:56.069 --> 04:00.824
I had no choice but to
unleash every kid's secret weapon:

04:00.908 --> 04:03.827
the dreaded silent treatment.

04:11.543 --> 04:14.963
I would offer you breakfast,
but we're all out of plates.

04:18.759 --> 04:22.471
Are you excited to see Janie and Sport
for your science project?

04:24.806 --> 04:27.017
Ole Golly, I leave this one to you.

04:31.897 --> 04:35.734
If Ole Golly thought
she was going to out-silent me,

04:35.817 --> 04:38.278
she had another thing coming.

04:39.530 --> 04:42.866
Ole Golly may have been
a master of silent treatments,

04:42.950 --> 04:46.703
but luckily,
I was a super double-decker master.

04:59.925 --> 05:02.928
"You have a grand gift for silence,
Watson.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.764
It makes you quite invaluable
as a companion."

05:05.848 --> 05:07.349
Enough with the quotes!

05:07.432 --> 05:10.727
Gotcha. That's from
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.604
I don't care where it's from.

05:12.688 --> 05:16.233
I can't believe you'd take her side
instead of mine.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.360
Harriet, that's not fair.

05:18.443 --> 05:21.822
At least take an umbrella.
It looks like rain again.

05:23.115 --> 05:26.869
What wasn't fair
was that Ole Golly had betrayed me.

05:29.204 --> 05:32.082
As mean as my mom and Ole Golly
had been to me,

05:32.165 --> 05:34.459
the city felt even meaner.

05:41.216 --> 05:45.304
Hey. Are you laughing at me?
You better not be!

05:47.431 --> 05:48.640
Yuck.

05:48.724 --> 05:50.893
This whole city stinks!

05:51.810 --> 05:53.520
Before seeing my best friends,

05:53.604 --> 05:57.107
I decided to shake off my bad mood
the way I always did.

05:57.191 --> 05:59.151
My spy route.

05:59.234 --> 06:01.528
I stopped by Mr. Withers's first.

06:01.612 --> 06:04.990
Mom and I knew him from the flea market
where he sold his birdcages.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.576
But we haven't seen him there for a while.

06:07.659 --> 06:11.121
He's always home with his cats now.
And I don't blame him.

06:11.205 --> 06:15.459
After all, he has 26 of them.
Now that's living.

06:16.168 --> 06:21.423
I used to think Withers was a shut-in,
but maybe he's a shut-out.

06:21.507 --> 06:25.552
He shuts out this rotten world
to give himself a little peace.

06:28.972 --> 06:32.518
He's leaving? This I gotta see.

06:47.533 --> 06:49.201
No takers again.

06:52.871 --> 06:58.710
"Neighbors, I need a cat sitter
Saturday afternoon. Withers."

06:58.794 --> 07:00.796
That's today.

07:00.879 --> 07:03.841
This was the answer to all my problems.

07:03.924 --> 07:08.262
If Mr. Withers was gone,
I could use his apartment to be alone

07:08.345 --> 07:11.557
and shut out this whole rotten world too.

07:15.352 --> 07:17.855
Hi, Mr. Withers. Hello, kitties.

07:17.938 --> 07:21.692
Harriet, right? Look at you.
I haven't seen you in ages.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.026
How's your mother?

07:23.110 --> 07:25.654
She's okay, I guess. For a mom.

07:25.737 --> 07:28.073
To what do I owe this pleasure?

07:28.156 --> 07:31.869
I saw your flyer.
Are you still looking for a cat sitter?

07:31.952 --> 07:33.328
My. Oh, yes.

07:33.412 --> 07:37.833
I have to go to Albany
to attend to some unpaid parking tickets.

07:37.916 --> 07:42.045
And I would very much prefer to hire
someone I know to look after my beauties.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.840
I'm Harriet M. Welsch, pleased to meet ya.

07:47.050 --> 07:51.263
Your mother just gave her permission,
as long as you get your work done.

07:51.346 --> 07:53.807
I assume you know what that means.

07:53.891 --> 07:56.226
Work? Uh-huh, I'm on it.

07:56.310 --> 07:59.062
Let me give you a tour of my domicile.

08:02.024 --> 08:06.028
If you use the bathroom, make sure
to jiggle the handle. Kitchen nook, there.

08:06.111 --> 08:10.073
And this is where I wrestle
a fistful of wires into a birdcage.

08:11.033 --> 08:15.537
Mom and I love your birdcages.
But why do they have locks?

08:15.621 --> 08:20.000
It's not just to keep birds in, Harriet.
It's to keep trouble out.

08:20.709 --> 08:25.297
As for the cat food,
my beauties love this brand.

08:27.299 --> 08:31.261
Now, there are a lot of cats,
so I made it easy.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.639
The black cats are all named Bobby,

08:33.722 --> 08:35.974
the ginger cats are all Tommy,

08:36.058 --> 08:38.227
and the striped ones are Geraldines.

08:38.936 --> 08:41.813
What about that spotted one,
the calico cat?

08:44.024 --> 08:47.486
This is Ray, and there's just one of her.

08:49.821 --> 08:53.534
Now, Harriet, there's something
very important you need to know.

08:53.617 --> 09:00.082
There's a man. He's from animal control.
He wants to take my cats away.

09:00.165 --> 09:02.751
If you hear a knock,
look through the peephole.

09:02.835 --> 09:07.840
If you see a man in a brown fedora,
don't let him in, okay?

09:07.923 --> 09:11.009
Your cats are safe with me, Mr. Withers.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.428
That's what we like to hear.

09:13.512 --> 09:14.638
Right, my beauties?

09:14.721 --> 09:16.932
I'll be back by seven o'clock.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.392
Don't miss me too much.

09:22.354 --> 09:28.819
Ladies and gentle-cats, show of paws,
who wants to start with a little spying?

09:31.321 --> 09:32.364
Me too.

09:33.407 --> 09:37.160
Three, two, one.

09:39.079 --> 09:42.291
Best clock ever.

09:44.293 --> 09:46.753
Lone fork, I salute you.

09:51.300 --> 09:54.469
What do you know?
Mr. Withers has a family.

09:54.553 --> 09:56.763
Wonder why the picture is facedown.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.935
-Outta the way, you ole crab apple!
-Make me!

10:02.978 --> 10:04.521
Be quiet!

10:04.605 --> 10:07.024
There's gotta be a way to--

10:07.107 --> 10:08.734
How did she put it?

10:09.318 --> 10:11.612
"In the vastness of space

10:11.695 --> 10:16.450
you feel truly alone, truly at peace."

10:18.452 --> 10:21.955
All systems are go, Captain Harriet.
Now entering the catosphere.

10:22.039 --> 10:25.584
Good work, First Officer Ray.
Good work, crew.

10:25.667 --> 10:26.668
Captain.

10:28.587 --> 10:33.050
Time to enjoy all that peace
I've heard so much about.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.136
Captain, apologies,
but it's my duty to report

10:36.220 --> 10:39.056
you were expected at Janie's house
an hour ago.

10:39.765 --> 10:42.267
Janie's house! The science project!

10:48.565 --> 10:52.611
Hi, Janie. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

10:52.694 --> 10:56.073
I know. Can we work on it later?

10:56.156 --> 11:00.035
I'm kinda doing something
at Mr. Withers's and--

11:00.118 --> 11:03.914
You wanna come here? Okay, see you soon.

11:11.380 --> 11:12.714
This is wild.

11:14.716 --> 11:18.387
Hello. Hello. Hello.

11:18.470 --> 11:20.889
How does he keep track of so many cats?

11:20.973 --> 11:24.601
Well, good sir, there's Tommys, Bobbys,

11:24.685 --> 11:27.688
and may I present the Geraldines.

11:28.522 --> 11:33.068
I must say, old bean,
your mustache looks positively dashing.

11:33.151 --> 11:37.531
Thank you, good sir.
It took ever so long to grow.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.241
All right, old chums.

11:39.324 --> 11:42.119
I call to order the business of the day.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.746
It's time to make potato flashlights!

11:44.830 --> 11:46.540
Potato flashlight

11:46.623 --> 11:52.171
Okay, we've got insulated wire, pennies,
small zinc-plated rods, a tiny light bulb,

11:52.254 --> 11:55.048
gloves for each of us
and a couple of small potatoes.

11:55.132 --> 11:57.509
I don't get it. Why use some dusty spud

11:57.593 --> 11:59.803
when there's batteries
at every corner store?

11:59.887 --> 12:01.430
It's called connectivity.

12:01.513 --> 12:04.516
The right parts coming together
to make a thing--

12:05.225 --> 12:08.103
a thing work.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.355
You okay, Sport?

12:10.439 --> 12:13.150
Yeah. Don't worry.
It's just a mild cat allergy.

12:13.692 --> 12:15.319
Yeah, keep going, Janie.

12:17.863 --> 12:19.156
Okay.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.450
First, you gotta take the potato like--

12:22.743 --> 12:27.414
like this, and grab one of
these iron rods like this.

12:27.497 --> 12:28.916
The spuds are pretty soft.

12:29.917 --> 12:32.419
And you wanna jam the rod in
so it feels secure.

12:33.253 --> 12:37.424
Copper on one side
and zinc on the other makes it so-- Hey.

12:39.968 --> 12:41.053
Give that back.

12:42.137 --> 12:46.850
Okay. That's it.
This is not a conducive space for science.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.977
What? This place is great.

12:49.061 --> 12:50.479
Look what it's doing to Sport.

12:50.562 --> 12:52.481
I've never felt better.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.651
Let's go to my house.

12:55.734 --> 12:59.696
I can't.
I promised Mr. Withers I'd watch his cats.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.699
But we have to finish this project now.

13:03.158 --> 13:05.494
Well, what if I don't want to?

13:06.119 --> 13:07.538
What's that supposed to mean?

13:07.621 --> 13:12.251
It means I came here to be alone,
as in by myself,

13:12.334 --> 13:14.253
as in without you guys!

13:15.712 --> 13:17.714
Fine. Be alone.

13:17.798 --> 13:18.882
Come on, Sport.

13:22.594 --> 13:24.596
See you later, Harriet.

13:29.685 --> 13:31.019
Now, where were we?

13:31.103 --> 13:33.605
Hey, Ray. Catch.

13:36.358 --> 13:38.026
Got it.

13:38.110 --> 13:41.780
-And the crowd goes wild.
-Very nice! Way to go!

13:45.409 --> 13:47.286
Do you hear that buzzer?

13:47.369 --> 13:50.455
Indeed. It's an incoming communication
from an alien ship.

13:50.539 --> 13:54.918
More people? Ignore it, Officer.
Our mission is too important.

13:55.002 --> 13:57.963
Okay, but it's really annoying.
Right, guys?

13:58.046 --> 14:00.090
-Yeah, really annoying.
-Obnoxious.

14:09.766 --> 14:15.814
It's the man
in the brown fedora. Animal control.

14:24.615 --> 14:28.076
That was close. Too close.

14:28.160 --> 14:30.621
If we're going to be truly alone,

14:30.704 --> 14:36.001
send us to super-duper, double-duper,
deep-duper space.

14:36.084 --> 14:38.086
That's a lot of dupers, sir.

14:38.170 --> 14:41.715
First Officer, are you a cat or a mouse?

14:42.841 --> 14:44.593
Cosmonauts, to your stations.

15:01.860 --> 15:04.154
Wow. We're very far now.

15:05.948 --> 15:06.990
I'm okay.

15:07.074 --> 15:09.368
No Earth. No people.

15:10.786 --> 15:12.829
No one to spy on.

15:12.913 --> 15:17.709
The only thing I can think to write about
is that there is nothing to write about.

15:19.753 --> 15:22.005
Maybe a little snack will cheer me up.

15:36.603 --> 15:40.607
Yuck! Cat food? I must be losing it.

15:42.818 --> 15:44.987
Hello? Is somebody there?

15:49.199 --> 15:51.159
Keep it together, Harriet M. Welsch.

15:51.243 --> 15:54.913
Those are just cats.
This is just a blackout.

15:54.997 --> 15:57.833
And like a good spy,
you're always prepared.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.880
Dang batteries.

16:02.963 --> 16:03.964
Go away!

16:22.566 --> 16:24.776
The alien ship has tracked us.

16:24.860 --> 16:27.446
First Lieutenant Ray, get us out of here!

16:27.529 --> 16:32.409
Ray? Bobbys? Tommys? Geraldines?

16:36.455 --> 16:38.332
Leave us alone!

16:42.085 --> 16:45.214
Harriet? It's Ole Golly. Please let me in.

16:45.297 --> 16:46.632
Ole Golly.

16:46.715 --> 16:49.468
Janie and Sport told me
they were worried about you.

16:49.551 --> 16:51.386
Please let me in. I wanna help.

16:52.846 --> 16:55.641
Oh, yeah, like you helped me
with my mom and the plates?

16:55.724 --> 17:00.604
I don't trust you.
I just want to be alone!

17:00.687 --> 17:03.607
Harriet, remember the quote by John Donne?

17:03.690 --> 17:09.613
"No man is an island entire of itself;
every man is a piece of the continent,

17:09.695 --> 17:11.740
a part of the main."

17:12.406 --> 17:15.117
I like my island fine, thank you.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.413
Gotcha.

17:18.497 --> 17:20.624
It had to be a quote.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.877
I'm really glad to see you, Ole Golly.

17:25.921 --> 17:27.964
Harriet, the cats!

17:28.048 --> 17:29.049
No!

17:34.763 --> 17:38.225
Six o'clock? Mr. Withers
is going to be home in an hour.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.561
Harriet, let's go rustle up some cats.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.441
We thought we'd check in on you.

17:47.276 --> 17:51.822
We got two, but I saw at least ten
go that way. It was like a cat tsunami.

17:52.406 --> 17:55.534
Wait! You guys, about before…

17:55.617 --> 17:57.578
You can beg for mercy later.

17:58.161 --> 18:00.747
Right now, we got cats to catch.

18:05.377 --> 18:06.378
-Gotcha.
-Hey.

18:09.715 --> 18:11.592
Stop right there.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.972
Stay away, brown fedora man.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.724
This man is from animal control.

18:18.807 --> 18:22.019
He's going to get Mr. Withers in trouble
for having too many cats.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.103
What?

18:24.062 --> 18:27.065
I'm not animal control.
My name is Ray Withers.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.776
I'm Jim Withers's older brother.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.321
Older brother?

18:33.822 --> 18:38.202
Ray? You're the older boy
from the photo I saw in the house.

18:38.285 --> 18:41.830
I'm relieved to hear Jim
still has photos of me.

18:41.914 --> 18:45.083
But if you're his brother,
why are you banging down his door?

18:45.167 --> 18:46.502
It's a long story.

18:47.044 --> 18:50.964
I've been trying forever to get Jim
to open his door and talk, but,

18:51.048 --> 18:53.300
well, he won't let me in.

18:53.383 --> 18:55.677
I guess he didn't want you
to let me in either.

18:56.720 --> 19:01.141
I bet if you help us find his cats,
that would be one doozy of a door opener.

19:01.225 --> 19:02.184
What do you say?

19:03.101 --> 19:04.645
Count me in.

19:06.897 --> 19:08.857
In a bazillion years,

19:08.941 --> 19:11.527
I never could've guessed
what happened next.

19:19.535 --> 19:21.286
Hey, this one of yours?

19:21.370 --> 19:23.664
I thought nobody in the world cared.

19:23.747 --> 19:28.502
But here they all were, trying so hard
to help a complete stranger.

19:32.673 --> 19:33.674
Hey!

19:47.396 --> 19:48.564
Excuse me, sir.

19:51.233 --> 19:53.569
That's very nice of you, sir.

19:53.652 --> 19:56.572
And with everyone looking,
we found all the cats.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.491
Except for one.

20:00.784 --> 20:02.286
Where's Ray?

20:02.369 --> 20:03.787
Harriet!

20:04.955 --> 20:05.998
Spots.

20:07.499 --> 20:08.500
There!

20:10.878 --> 20:12.838
I can't see anything in there.

20:13.589 --> 20:16.425
Janie, do you still have
all that flashlight-making stuff?

20:17.009 --> 20:18.969
Did Albert Einstein play violin?

20:20.721 --> 20:24.975
He did. But one problem.
Ray took all the potatoes.

20:25.684 --> 20:26.685
Ray, the cat.

20:26.768 --> 20:29.813
-Will these do?
-Thank you, sir.

20:29.897 --> 20:31.231
You're welcome, madam.

20:37.529 --> 20:39.114
Let's hope this works.

20:45.746 --> 20:46.914
Over there!

21:01.178 --> 21:02.262
Connectivity.

21:10.479 --> 21:11.688
Connectivity.

21:25.619 --> 21:29.540
I'm so happy to be home
with all my… beauties.

21:32.084 --> 21:33.502
Hello, Jim.

21:34.545 --> 21:37.756
What's he doing here, Harriet?
I told you not to let anyone in.

21:37.840 --> 21:39.925
He just wants to talk to you.

21:40.008 --> 21:41.718
I'm not talking to him.

21:41.802 --> 21:43.053
Jim.

21:43.136 --> 21:45.055
This is my home, my life.

21:45.138 --> 21:48.559
And I just want to be alone with my cats.
The rest of you can go.

21:48.642 --> 21:51.019
Mr. Withers, we are sorry
for the intrusion,

21:51.103 --> 21:54.231
but Harriet needed a little backup,
and we came to help.

21:54.857 --> 21:56.608
Jim, please.

21:56.692 --> 21:59.278
Mom's been gone four years now.

21:59.361 --> 22:02.197
You don't have to keep
suffering in silence.

22:02.281 --> 22:05.450
Let's talk.
We can get through this together.

22:05.534 --> 22:08.453
You gave him the silent treatment
for four years?

22:08.537 --> 22:10.372
That beats my record.

22:10.455 --> 22:13.500
When Mother left us,
all I wanted was to be left alone.

22:13.584 --> 22:18.213
To have some space. But truthfully,
I've never been lonelier.

22:18.297 --> 22:22.926
Space can do that to you, Mr. Withers.
I should know, I've been there.

22:23.010 --> 22:25.888
I miss you, Ray. I miss Mom too.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.600
I think we both could use some backup.

22:35.814 --> 22:36.940
Thank you, Harriet.

22:40.694 --> 22:43.947
Mr. Withers made me
this beautiful birdcage.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.034
I spent this whole day thinking that

22:47.117 --> 22:50.829
I could only be happy if
I found a way to get out of this world.

22:52.414 --> 22:56.502
But now I think the trick is
you have to let the world in.

23:04.593 --> 23:07.137
I just wanna be
You just wanna be

23:07.221 --> 23:09.014
We just wanna be

23:10.140 --> 23:12.684
I don't wanna be
You don't wanna be

23:12.768 --> 23:18.273
We don't wanna be told what to do

23:20.108 --> 23:26.114
Yeah, and I try my best to do good
In the neighborhood

23:26.198 --> 23:28.408
I smile real nice

23:28.492 --> 23:31.662
And I strive to tell the truth

23:31.745 --> 23:34.540
I just wanna be
You just wanna be

23:34.623 --> 23:36.458
We just wanna be

23:37.167 --> 23:39.837
I don't wanna be
You don't wanna be

23:39.920 --> 23:42.673
We don't wanna be told what to do

23:42.756 --> 23:45.300
I am gonna be who I wanna be

23:45.384 --> 23:46.927
My autonomy

23:48.095 --> 23:50.764
I just wanna be
You just wanna be

23:50.848 --> 23:52.599
We just wanna be

23:52.683 --> 23:55.435
No, I won't cut my hair

23:55.853 --> 23:58.272
And I'll wear whatever

23:58.355 --> 24:03.944
I like it when I get to be myself

24:04.027 --> 24:07.072
I don't wanna be
You don't wanna be

24:07.155 --> 24:11.743
We don't wanna be told what to do
