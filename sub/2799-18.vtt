00:19.186 --> 00:20.589
Stacy Vollmer was last seen

00:20.656 --> 00:23.430
practicing alone on
the school tennis court

00:23.496 --> 00:25.468
that Friday at around 9:00 p. m.

00:28.140 --> 00:32.049
The clothes she was wearing
were found in her locker.

00:41.294 --> 00:43.778
Her body was discovered
near the football field

00:43.845 --> 00:47.707
by the landscaping crew the
following Monday morning.

00:50.293 --> 00:52.632
Can you tell us the exact
location of the body?

00:52.699 --> 00:56.274
She was dumped in a flower bed,
wrapped in a shower curtain.

00:57.669 --> 00:59.833
CSI arrived an hour later,

00:59.868 --> 01:03.323
excavated the body and
began processing the scene.

01:08.002 --> 01:10.072
Dr. Robbins, can you
tell us how Stacy died?

01:10.749 --> 01:12.646
Beneath this laceration,

01:12.712 --> 01:15.653
I found a complex fracture
of the occipital bone.

01:15.720 --> 01:19.629
Multiple shards of bone were
driven into the occipital lobe

01:19.696 --> 01:21.132
of the brain,

01:21.198 --> 01:22.468
resulting in massive bleeding.

01:22.536 --> 01:25.724
The cause of death was
cerebral hemorrhage,

01:25.759 --> 01:29.006
consistent with a single,
sharp blow to her head.

01:36.895 --> 01:38.618
A search of the defendant's home

01:38.653 --> 01:40.578
yielded a laundry hamper

01:40.645 --> 01:42.850
containing the clothes he
wore the night of the murder.

01:42.851 --> 01:44.253
Did you find any blood

01:44.320 --> 01:45.494
or DNA on the clothes?

01:45.529 --> 01:48.296
No. We determined
they had been bleached.

01:48.748 --> 01:52.386
Isn't bleach used to destroy
blood and DNA evidence?

01:52.421 --> 01:53.934
Objection: argumentative.

01:53.969 --> 01:55.151
Withdrawn.

01:55.186 --> 01:56.549
What else did you find in the house?

01:56.616 --> 01:59.089
Human hairs consistent with the victim

01:59.188 --> 02:02.664
were discovered in the
drain of the bathroom sink.

02:02.731 --> 02:04.101
DNA was extracted

02:04.167 --> 02:06.472
and was also matched to the victim.

02:06.540 --> 02:09.982
And based on this evidence,
police arrested Marlon West.

02:11.383 --> 02:12.621
That's correct.

02:13.291 --> 02:14.458
Thank you, Mr. Stokes.

02:14.525 --> 02:16.335
No further questions.

02:18.068 --> 02:20.573
The State now calls Hannah West.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.843
Your Honor,

02:21.910 --> 02:23.212
defense reiterates our objection.

02:23.279 --> 02:24.917
She's a
12-year-old girl.

02:24.983 --> 02:27.556
We've been through
this already, counsel.

02:27.622 --> 02:30.529
The defendant's sister is being
called as a hostile witness.

02:30.596 --> 02:32.701
That means the district
attorney is permitted

02:32.769 --> 02:34.706
to ask leading questions.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.310
Be nice.

02:45.565 --> 02:47.737
Now, Hannah, isn't it a fact

02:47.804 --> 02:51.579
that on the night of
Friday, December 2, 2005,

02:51.646 --> 02:53.986
your parents left you and your brother,

02:54.052 --> 02:55.756
the defendant, home alone?

02:55.823 --> 02:57.093
They went away for a...

02:57.160 --> 02:58.162
Yes or no, please.

02:58.229 --> 02:59.665
Yes.

02:59.732 --> 03:01.603
And isn't it also a fact

03:01.670 --> 03:03.507
that you and your
brother were not together

03:03.574 --> 03:06.414
between the hours of
6:00 and 10:00 p. m.?

03:06.481 --> 03:07.841
Well, Marlon
- he didn't really...

03:07.876 --> 03:09.689
Yes or no?

03:10.714 --> 03:11.625
Yes.

03:12.078 --> 03:12.596
Thank you, Hannah.

03:12.663 --> 03:13.704
I'd like to say something...

03:13.739 --> 03:15.937
No further questions, Your Honor.

03:16.004 --> 03:17.373
Cross-examination?

03:17.741 --> 03:19.345
Absolutely, Your Honor.

03:20.088 --> 03:22.623
Uh, Hannah, wh-what
were you trying to say?

03:22.658 --> 03:24.546
Objection: calls for a narrative.

03:24.581 --> 03:25.559
Overruled.

03:26.152 --> 03:26.876
You go ahead, Hannah.

03:26.911 --> 03:28.499
You say what you need to say.

03:30.973 --> 03:34.046
Marlon didn't kill Stacy.

03:38.657 --> 03:39.827
I did.

03:43.068 --> 03:45.707
And I was wearing this when I did it.

04:30.792 --> 04:33.042
Good news is Judge Crawford denied

04:33.077 --> 04:35.292
the defense's motion to dismiss.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.095
Of course he did.

04:36.130 --> 04:37.324
She's just a mixed-up kid

04:37.359 --> 04:38.994
trying to protect her older brother.

04:39.060 --> 04:40.986
All the evidence points to Marlon.

04:41.052 --> 04:42.348
Yeah, and all the
jury's going to remember

04:42.383 --> 04:44.139
is a little girl in a bloody shirt

04:44.206 --> 04:45.011
confessing to murder.

04:45.046 --> 04:47.319
That's reasonable doubt
on a silver platter.

04:47.354 --> 04:48.521
All right, then we have to prove

04:48.556 --> 04:50.000
that Hannah could not have done this.

04:50.036 --> 04:50.970
Exactly.

04:51.005 --> 04:53.089
We'll need a week to
reexamine the evidence.

04:53.124 --> 04:55.173
Judge gave the D.A.
a 72-hour continuance.

04:55.208 --> 04:55.825
Come on...

04:55.860 --> 04:57.150
Best he could do, Nick.

04:57.151 --> 04:59.635
Now you go do your best.

05:34.160 --> 05:36.517
<i>Everybody thought Stacy was so...</i>

05:36.584 --> 05:38.210
<i>special.</i>

05:38.277 --> 05:40.036
<i>She thought so, too.</i>

05:40.135 --> 05:41.729
<i>She wasn't.</i>

05:41.796 --> 05:45.049
<i>Stacy was a stuck-up bitch
and a miserable person.</i>

05:45.114 --> 05:47.041
<i>I just put her out of her misery.</i>

05:49.263 --> 05:51.445
<i>I killed her and I
put her in the ground.</i>

05:51.480 --> 05:53.945
<i>That's all I've got to say.</i>

05:55.737 --> 05:57.330
The judge suppressed the video

05:57.397 --> 05:59.560
because a child advocate
was never brought in,

05:59.595 --> 06:01.509
even though Marlon
had waived his rights.

06:01.545 --> 06:03.426
We really didn't need
a confeson out of him.

06:03.461 --> 06:05.695
The case against this kid was solid.

06:06.724 --> 06:07.613
It started out as a prank:

06:07.680 --> 06:10.252
a sabotaged showerhead.

06:12.925 --> 06:15.278
pH tests later revealed the presence

06:15.313 --> 06:16.701
of a strong base substance

06:16.737 --> 06:19.300
which was later identified
as sodium hydroxide.

06:19.335 --> 06:20.606
Sounds like Marlon packed

06:20.641 --> 06:22.428
the showerhead with elemental sodium.

06:22.463 --> 06:24.393
A high school chemistry favorite, yeah.

06:24.428 --> 06:26.323
Just add water, and instant kaboom.

06:26.390 --> 06:30.031
Those out-of-order signs
must've been part of his game.

06:30.032 --> 06:32.464
You funnel the victim
to the right showerhead.

06:33.220 --> 06:34.407
Did you process the?

06:34.442 --> 06:36.756
Yeah, I matched the
spindle marks on the paper

06:36.791 --> 06:39.069
to a laser printer in
the high school library.

06:39.104 --> 06:41.058
Accessible to any student.

06:41.751 --> 06:44.845
"Multiple fragments of metal
penetrating the skin and dermis

06:44.880 --> 06:47.389
"as deep as the superficial musculature

06:47.424 --> 06:49.564
of the back and neck".

06:49.599 --> 06:51.576
The showerhead explosion
didn't kill her.

06:51.611 --> 06:53.487
No, no, it did not.

06:53.554 --> 06:55.678
What happened to the shower curtain?

06:55.713 --> 06:57.765
Well, the vic was injured, disoriented.

06:57.801 --> 07:00.779
She grabbed the first thing
she could to cover up and ran.

07:02.637 --> 07:06.085
The intermittent blood trail
started in the locker room

07:06.120 --> 07:07.685
and headed down a hall.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.968
So Marlon followed her out
just to hear her squeal?

07:11.003 --> 07:12.559
Or chased her out, yeah.

07:12.594 --> 07:14.082
There's no way to know.

07:14.117 --> 07:16.478
Either way, she ended up
at the bottom of the stairs.

07:16.513 --> 07:17.990
The size of the blood pool

07:18.025 --> 07:20.426
indicates that the fatal
wound occurred there.

07:20.461 --> 07:22.074
Do you have any physical evidence

07:22.109 --> 07:25.006
that would conclusively
rule Hannah out as a suspect?

07:26.045 --> 07:29.372
Well, yeah- she's
four-foot-three and 65 pounds.

07:29.439 --> 07:32.514
The crime just required
more strength than she's got.

07:32.830 --> 07:34.199
How old is she?

07:34.235 --> 07:35.713
Twelve.

07:36.464 --> 07:37.548
In high school?

07:37.583 --> 07:39.577
She's a high school senior.

07:39.612 --> 07:41.571
She skipped six grades.

07:41.606 --> 07:42.601
She's a prodigy.

07:42.636 --> 07:46.378
Which means she has
the brains for murder.

07:46.413 --> 07:47.973
Yeah, but not the brawn.

07:48.008 --> 07:49.954
The body was moved from
the high school building

07:50.021 --> 07:51.379
across a football field

07:51.414 --> 07:52.702
and then hastily buried.

07:52.737 --> 07:55.247
The vic's car was then
driven two miles from campus

07:55.282 --> 07:57.757
and parked in front of
the house of a kid named

07:57.792 --> 08:00.171
Scott Baird, Stacy's boyfriend-

08:00.206 --> 08:01.995
I think possibly to frame him.

08:02.030 --> 08:03.491
Was he ever a suspect?

08:03.526 --> 08:05.294
No. He plays varsity hoops.

08:05.329 --> 08:07.496
He was out of town on an away game.

08:07.562 --> 08:09.902
I found blades of grass

08:09.969 --> 08:12.139
with blood on them near the vic's car-

08:12.206 --> 08:15.216
nondescript tracks headed towards
the next-door neighbor's house.

08:15.251 --> 08:16.069
Marlon West.

08:16.104 --> 08:17.853
Yeah. This kid's been in trouble before.

08:17.888 --> 08:19.925
Multiple fights, threats.

08:20.357 --> 08:22.665
It just got out of hand this time.

08:22.732 --> 08:26.072
Marlon West killed Stacy Vollmer.

08:26.139 --> 08:29.269
His little sister's just
trying to exonerate him.

09:32.797 --> 09:33.543
Hey, Nick.

09:33.578 --> 09:35.303
Hodges, did you get
the soil analysis back

09:35.370 --> 09:35.978
on Hannah's shirt?

09:36.013 --> 09:37.352
Matches the site of the body dump.

09:37.387 --> 09:38.812
Really?

09:38.847 --> 09:41.652
So does this make Doogie
Howser-ette your killer?

09:41.719 --> 09:42.633
Uh, I kind of doubt it.

09:42.668 --> 09:45.761
Don't be so sure. It's not easy.

09:46.797 --> 09:48.704
What isn't easy, Hodges?

09:48.739 --> 09:50.578
Being profoundly gifted,

09:50.613 --> 09:52.601
knowing that everybody
knows that you're always

09:52.636 --> 09:54.194
ten steps ahead of them.

09:54.229 --> 09:55.752
It's a lot of pressure.

09:56.181 --> 09:58.294
Some days, you feel like
you're just going to snap.

09:58.458 --> 09:59.794
I know the feeling.

10:01.289 --> 10:02.831
In his confession,

10:02.866 --> 10:05.942
Marlon basically said
that Stacy deserved to die.

10:06.009 --> 10:07.535
He was alone in that opinion.

10:07.570 --> 10:10.066
Everybody loved Stacy
- parents and students.

10:10.467 --> 10:14.687
4.0 GPA, varsity tennis
team, homecoming queen.

10:14.722 --> 10:16.981
She even took a public virginity pledge

10:17.016 --> 10:18.442
with some of her classmates.

10:18.478 --> 10:20.686
Did they have those in your high school?

10:20.721 --> 10:21.819
No.

10:21.860 --> 10:24.152
Do you believe that Marlon killed her?

10:24.219 --> 10:26.056
I was looking right into his eyes

10:26.124 --> 10:27.777
when he told me he did it.

10:27.813 --> 10:29.431
There's no doubt in my mind.

10:31.265 --> 10:33.540
Two confessions, one crime.

10:33.607 --> 10:36.206
We don't get that a lot.

10:36.241 --> 10:37.821
When did you last speak with Marlon?

10:37.856 --> 10:40.782
The day the police ce to
my house and arrested him.

10:40.817 --> 10:42.367
You don't visit him?

10:42.402 --> 10:45.068
My parents won't let me see him in jail.

10:45.134 --> 10:46.839
Bad environment.

10:47.534 --> 10:49.508
Marlon didn't put me up to this.

10:49.543 --> 10:51.482
He was trying to protect me.

10:51.550 --> 10:54.659
It would've been wrong to let him
be punished for something I did.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.206
You don't think I could have done it.

11:01.274 --> 11:02.376
Neither one of you.

11:02.411 --> 11:05.716
That's a big job for a little girl.

11:06.053 --> 11:07.934
Not if you have the right tools.

11:08.625 --> 11:12.824
Smart kid like you... knows
your brother's suffering.

11:12.859 --> 11:15.389
You feel bad, you want to help,

11:15.424 --> 11:17.885
so you fabricate some evidence.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.913
If you thought that
the evidence was fake,

11:19.948 --> 11:22.122
I wouldn't still be in jail.

11:24.996 --> 11:27.802
Aren't you going to ask me why I did it?

11:27.868 --> 11:29.707
Would you like to tell us?

11:31.745 --> 11:33.018
I throw off the curve.

11:33.053 --> 11:34.257
When I'm in a class,

11:34.292 --> 11:37.826
people who usually get
A's, suddenly get C's.

11:37.892 --> 11:40.164
Stacy was applying to Harvard.

11:40.232 --> 11:42.771
She wanted me to dumb myself down.

11:42.838 --> 11:44.675
I said no.

11:44.742 --> 11:46.847
She didn't like that.

11:50.255 --> 11:52.774
Uh... babies use the wall dryer.

12:01.314 --> 12:04.232
So you killed her because
she messed up your hair?

12:04.267 --> 12:05.322
No.

12:05.522 --> 12:08.131
I'm used to pranks like that.

12:08.198 --> 12:09.860
I get them most every day.

12:10.361 --> 12:14.104
But Stacy... didn't stop there.

12:14.139 --> 12:16.551
She had to take it to another level.

12:16.617 --> 12:18.939
And she used Scott to do it.

12:18.974 --> 12:21.262
Scott Baird, Stacy's boyfriend.

12:22.295 --> 12:24.425
I was his tutor.

12:24.582 --> 12:26.014
You know, I was really pissed off

12:26.049 --> 12:28.513
at Stacy when I heard about e whole...

12:28.580 --> 12:29.860
hair dryer thing,

12:29.895 --> 12:32.701
but her... her friends
had put her up to it.

12:32.736 --> 12:35.262
Stacy wanted me to give you something.

12:36.693 --> 12:38.466
It's a peace offering.

12:38.501 --> 12:41.276
I think you'll look great
in it at the Spring Formal.

12:43.213 --> 12:45.018
Oh, you are so going.

12:47.489 --> 12:48.791
You like him.

12:48.991 --> 12:51.758
He's on the basketball team.

12:52.459 --> 12:56.321
I'm 12. I'm not allowed
to like him, but...

12:56.356 --> 12:57.779
I went anyway.

13:09.074 --> 13:11.112
Over here.

13:33.719 --> 13:36.674
The pictures were up
on MySpace that night.

13:36.741 --> 13:38.169
I got a ton of e-mails.

13:38.204 --> 13:41.083
You put dium in the
showerhead to get back at her?

13:41.735 --> 13:43.308
A prank for a prank.

13:44.086 --> 13:46.023
I thought that there'd be a few sparks,

13:46.058 --> 13:47.959
that she'd freak out and that'd be it,

13:48.686 --> 13:52.294
but the nozzle exploded.

13:52.329 --> 13:57.456
Stacy ran... and fell down the stairs...

13:57.523 --> 13:59.093
and died.

14:00.764 --> 14:02.356
I tried to cover it up.

14:02.787 --> 14:04.804
You miscalculated.

14:05.698 --> 14:07.257
I guess I did.

14:13.996 --> 14:16.668
Got the DNA results on the
blood from Hannah's sweater.

14:17.552 --> 14:18.535
Stacy.

14:18.601 --> 14:19.968
Hannah.

14:20.035 --> 14:22.668
So she fabricated evidence,

14:22.735 --> 14:24.902
and put her own blood on the shirt.

14:24.968 --> 14:26.469
Maybe, maybe not.

14:26.536 --> 14:28.836
The soil on the shirt wa
consistent with the dump site.

14:29.342 --> 14:31.037
Hannah could've been at the scene.

14:31.992 --> 14:35.370
She could have cut
herself burying the body.

14:38.980 --> 14:40.470
Or she could have gone back to the field

14:40.537 --> 14:42.204
at any time within the last four months

14:42.270 --> 14:44.604
and rubbed her shirt in
the same kind of dirt.

14:44.671 --> 14:46.538
And counted on us to make the match?

14:46.872 --> 14:49.252
Well, that's just plain scary smart.

14:49.287 --> 14:50.663
I mean, my daughter's a
few years older than her,

14:50.697 --> 14:52.038
and the most important
thing on her mind right now

14:52.105 --> 14:54.671
is how much belly button
to show off at the mall.

14:55.940 --> 14:57.939
Never thought I'd be grateful for that.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.117
You have to understand.

15:08.152 --> 15:10.841
My child's not capable of murder.

15:10.908 --> 15:13.330
I assume you mean Hannah.

15:14.100 --> 15:15.375
Of course.

15:17.739 --> 15:19.709
Well, Marlon's your child, too.

15:19.775 --> 15:21.608
Marlon's from my wife's first marriage.

15:21.675 --> 15:23.276
He's more like his father.

15:35.699 --> 15:37.310
This is Marlon's room.

15:37.966 --> 15:39.123
No kidding.

15:39.157 --> 15:41.287
It's pretty much the way I left it.

15:42.744 --> 15:45.989
The bleached cloes were in the hamper.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.645
But the real action...

15:48.712 --> 15:50.305
was in here.

15:55.587 --> 15:58.379
Shared bathroom. Very Brady.

15:58.447 --> 16:00.705
Pulled Stacy's hairs
out of the sink trap

16:00.740 --> 16:02.280
the first time through.

16:03.346 --> 16:06.103
And I found some burn marks

16:06.170 --> 16:07.735
around the bathtub drain.

16:07.802 --> 16:11.467
pH tested positive for
sodium hydroxide, so...

16:11.900 --> 16:15.130
I figured Marlon
probably did a test run.

16:44.279 --> 16:46.743
The scope of the warrant
only covered Marlon's room

16:46.810 --> 16:48.776
and other common areas of the house.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.175
I popped my head in here.

16:50.949 --> 16:53.153
Nothing in plain sight at the time.

17:08.190 --> 17:10.248
Was this here before?

17:10.262 --> 17:11.727
It wasn't in plain sight.

17:11.794 --> 17:13.027
I didn't check it.

17:13.094 --> 17:15.358
Looks like Hannah won the science fair

17:15.425 --> 17:17.803
with a project about sodium.

17:20.722 --> 17:22.887
Hannah's just trying to help Marlon.

17:22.954 --> 17:24.186
So they're close?

17:24.253 --> 17:26.051
No, not really.

17:26.118 --> 17:28.019
Sometimes I think if they
didn't share a bathroom,

17:28.084 --> 17:29.549
they wouldn't see each other at all.

17:29.617 --> 17:30.455
What do you mean?

17:30.490 --> 17:32.448
They're on different academic tracks.

17:32.515 --> 17:34.180
Never take any of the same classes,

17:34.248 --> 17:36.528
and travel in completely
different social circles.

17:36.563 --> 17:38.678
From what we understand,

17:38.745 --> 17:41.176
Hannah doesn't really
have a social circle.

17:42.523 --> 17:44.774
The other students bore her.

17:44.841 --> 17:47.206
Hannah spends most of her
time with her teachers.

17:47.272 --> 17:48.504
And Marlon?

17:50.610 --> 17:51.902
I guess...

17:52.712 --> 17:54.968
I guess he spends
most of his time alone.

18:10.772 --> 18:12.192
"Rainbow party"?!

18:12.649 --> 18:14.824
Yeah, it's a party game
where boys get the girls

18:14.891 --> 18:16.696
to wear different colored lipsticks

18:16.732 --> 18:18.424
while they have oral sex.

18:18.490 --> 18:20.324
Boy with the most colors wins.

18:20.389 --> 18:21.590
Supposed to be trendy.

18:21.656 --> 18:23.223
So much for "Spin the Bottle".

18:24.188 --> 18:25.789
Carrie.

18:25.856 --> 18:27.073
"Weird high school girl

18:27.108 --> 18:28.848
"gets humiliated at the prom,

18:28.883 --> 18:30.587
only to exact her revenge".

18:31.053 --> 18:32.854
Hann wanted us to find this.

18:32.920 --> 18:34.254
Maybe.

18:34.320 --> 18:38.019
Question is, did she
read the book before...

18:38.086 --> 18:39.751
or aft the murder?

18:39.818 --> 18:42.551
We had Hannah's I.Q.
tested when she was eight.

18:43.646 --> 18:45.417
It's 177.

18:45.809 --> 18:47.664
She really is one in a million.

18:47.699 --> 18:48.916
Hannah's special.

18:48.983 --> 18:50.381
She's an indigo child.

18:50.798 --> 18:52.015
Indigo child?

18:52.115 --> 18:53.781
A new breed.

18:54.248 --> 18:55.781
Hannah doesn't just see the world,

18:55.848 --> 18:56.914
she sees through it,

18:56.981 --> 18:58.948
through people,

18:59.014 --> 19:01.412
with an intuition none
of us can comprehend.

19:01.660 --> 19:03.946
She's compelled to help others,

19:04.013 --> 19:06.778
whether they're worth helping or not.

19:42.363 --> 19:45.292
Ah, the shower curtain
the vic was wrapped in.

19:45.502 --> 19:47.035
Yeah, I had Mandy run the unknowns

19:47.102 --> 19:49.268
from the original case
against Hannah's prints.

19:49.334 --> 19:50.467
She got a match.

19:50.534 --> 19:52.267
Okay.

19:52.333 --> 19:55.100
But Hannah uses those
showers after gym class.

19:55.950 --> 19:58.202
This curtain was used in
the handicapped shower.

19:58.237 --> 19:59.098
Why would she do that?

19:59.165 --> 20:00.631
Probably hiding her body.

20:01.273 --> 20:02.231
She's 12.

20:02.377 --> 20:04.253
She hasn't reached puberty.

20:04.288 --> 20:07.107
Undeveloped teen girls
are very self-conscious.

20:09.372 --> 20:12.104
Four... fingers, closely spaced.

20:12.550 --> 20:14.069
Grabbing, maybe.

20:14.135 --> 20:17.800
Could be from Hannah
dragging Stacy's body.

20:24.330 --> 20:26.394
Hannah weighed 65 pounds.

20:26.761 --> 20:28.028
Stacy about a hundred.

20:28.650 --> 20:29.900
Dead weight.

20:30.379 --> 20:32.093
Plastic slides on grass.

20:32.158 --> 20:34.891
It makes it easier.
It's certainly possible.

20:35.430 --> 20:37.622
D.A.'s not going to
like the sound of that.

20:43.231 --> 20:44.753
Sodium demonstration is always

20:44.788 --> 20:46.516
a real crowd pleaser.

20:47.167 --> 20:50.116
It's ended up in a senior
prank more than once.

20:50.215 --> 20:52.214
I keep it over here, under lock and key,

20:52.281 --> 20:55.378
but, unfortunately, the lab's
always getting broken into.

20:58.644 --> 21:01.344
It's certainly possible Marlon
got the sodium from here.

21:01.379 --> 21:02.875
Everyone have their goggles on?

21:11.703 --> 21:14.194
Which is precisely what I
told the cops four months ago.

21:14.229 --> 21:16.694
You need gloves to
handle elemental sodium.

21:16.729 --> 21:17.566
Of course.

21:18.411 --> 21:19.665
It burns skin.

21:20.278 --> 21:22.515
We keep it in kerosene to stabilize it.

21:22.550 --> 21:25.578
Do you think it's possible that
Hannah could have stolen it?

21:25.613 --> 21:27.810
Hannah would never do that.

21:28.473 --> 21:31.425
I'm just wondering if it's possible.

21:31.491 --> 21:33.935
She obviously has access to this room.

21:33.971 --> 21:35.253
Ms. Sidle...

21:35.288 --> 21:38.486
I've had my share of good
students over the years,

21:39.260 --> 21:40.420
but Hannah...

21:40.486 --> 21:42.618
Sometimes, right in
the middle of a lecture,

21:42.685 --> 21:44.051
I'll catch her staring at some

21:44.118 --> 21:47.415
little thing in the yard
- a tree, a squirrel...

21:47.482 --> 21:50.281
and all I can think
about is how much I wish

21:50.347 --> 21:52.214
I could see it the way she does.

21:52.867 --> 21:54.111
If Hannah came up and asked me

21:54.178 --> 21:57.285
for a chunk of sodium,
I'd give it to her,

21:57.286 --> 21:59.776
just to see what she would do with it.

22:00.612 --> 22:03.241
The victim's car.

22:03.534 --> 22:05.727
Originally impounded...

22:05.794 --> 22:08.122
in front of Scott Baird's house.

22:08.189 --> 22:11.015
Traces of blood and soil
consistent with the crime

22:11.082 --> 22:12.843
were found in the front seat.

22:12.910 --> 22:17.564
Now, if Hannah's the killer,
she had to drive this car.

22:19.726 --> 22:21.589
Well, it's got adjustable seats,

22:21.655 --> 22:23.481
tilt and telescoping steering wheel-

22:23.516 --> 22:25.047
it's certainly possible.

22:29.413 --> 22:31.447
We go soil and blood on the carpet.

22:31.481 --> 22:32.794
That was in the report.

22:44.733 --> 22:46.653
But this wasn't.

23:17.054 --> 23:19.315
I'd say the killer moved the seat.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.210
Yeah.

23:29.855 --> 23:32.017
12-year-old
killer, huh?

23:32.546 --> 23:34.744
Starting to look that way, yeah.

23:34.810 --> 23:37.071
I bet that Grand Theft Auto
had something to do with it.

23:37.138 --> 23:38.367
Mm, I don't know.

23:38.402 --> 23:40.727
I don't think Hannah's
really the video-game type.

23:40.762 --> 23:42.059
Never know.

23:42.126 --> 23:44.553
Between you and me, I actually
think it's a ton of fun.

23:52.035 --> 23:54.629
Print is a match to Scott Baird.

23:55.395 --> 23:57.826
Isn't that the victim's boyfriend?

24:00.448 --> 24:02.276
Two people confessed to the murder,

24:02.343 --> 24:04.470
and now you're accusing my son?

24:04.537 --> 24:05.429
Kids do stupid things.

24:06.788 --> 24:08.301
Marlon covers for Hannah,

24:08.369 --> 24:10.016
Hannah covers for Scott.

24:10.084 --> 24:10.588
Dad...

24:10.623 --> 24:12.291
Don't say a word.

24:12.326 --> 24:14.791
DNA confirmed your
fingerprint in Stacy's car,

24:14.858 --> 24:16.404
in Stacy's blood.

24:16.472 --> 24:17.413
Scott loved Stacy.

24:17.958 --> 24:19.333
We all did.

24:19.368 --> 24:20.555
And when whoever killed her

24:20.590 --> 24:23.252
parked her car in my
driveway to frame my son,

24:23.287 --> 24:25.651
I understood why you had to talk to him.

24:25.718 --> 24:27.165
But this?

24:29.287 --> 24:30.458
That's it.

24:30.761 --> 24:32.439
We're leaving. Come on, Scott.

24:32.474 --> 24:35.481
This is the only chance
you're going to get.

24:35.482 --> 24:37.476
If you walk out that
door, you're under arrest.

24:37.789 --> 24:38.731
I want a lawyer.

24:38.798 --> 24:39.740
I want to talk...

24:39.809 --> 24:42.309
...without my dad.

24:52.074 --> 24:53.176
This is ridiculous.

24:54.112 --> 24:56.383
I asked you guys to
rule out one suspect,

24:56.450 --> 24:58.587
now we have three.

24:58.654 --> 25:00.323
He's willing to talk,

25:00.391 --> 25:01.559
I'd say we caught a break.

25:02.021 --> 25:03.496
The father's going to sue.

25:03.563 --> 25:05.132
Oh, I'd put money on that.

25:05.199 --> 25:06.167
<i>Okay, Scott.</i>

25:06.234 --> 25:07.570
<i>You said you wanted to talk.</i>

25:07.637 --> 25:08.973
Let's talk.

25:09.040 --> 25:13.481
This doesn't get back to
our families, all right?

25:13.548 --> 25:16.754
My dad's a deacon, and
Stacy's dad is, too.

25:16.821 --> 25:18.319
They'll never understand.

25:18.519 --> 25:20.917
They won't hear anything from me.

25:23.366 --> 25:27.240
I was pressuring Stacy to have sex.

25:28.177 --> 25:29.712
<i>She kept resisting.</i>

25:29.778 --> 25:32.133
It was that stupid virginity pledge

25:32.168 --> 25:34.487
that she had taken at the high school.

25:34.554 --> 25:36.826
I Id her that I loved her,

25:36.893 --> 25:40.198
and that nothing should
get in the way of that.

25:42.335 --> 25:43.938
Not even God.

25:44.669 --> 25:46.409
I take it that convinced her.

25:49.081 --> 25:50.082
Yeah.

25:52.989 --> 25:55.292
I mean, really?

25:56.179 --> 25:57.296
You really do?

25:57.362 --> 25:58.298
Yeah.

25:59.498 --> 26:00.938
I love you.

26:01.262 --> 26:03.373
I love you with all of my heart.

26:07.081 --> 26:09.251
There was a little blood.

26:09.864 --> 26:12.525
Not a lot, but...

26:12.592 --> 26:16.465
After, she... she
started feeling guilty, so

26:16.532 --> 26:18.536
<i>I went back into the front of the car</i>

26:18.603 --> 26:19.838
<i>and I tossed the condom.</i>

26:19.905 --> 26:23.578
And... then I...

26:23.645 --> 26:25.314
wiped my fingers under the seat.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.387
Hodges, Stokes.

26:28.455 --> 26:30.960
Listen, there's a bloody
fingerprint in the back freezer

26:31.027 --> 26:32.863
from Stacy Vollmer's car.

26:32.930 --> 26:35.935
Pull it and test it for
spermicides and lubricants.

26:36.002 --> 26:37.404
We need it quickly, all right?

26:37.471 --> 26:38.601
<i>I'm on it.</i>

26:39.009 --> 26:41.746
If it tests positive, it will clear him.

26:41.812 --> 26:43.082
Yeah.

26:43.148 --> 26:45.086
Which means we're down
to Malcolm and Hannah.

26:45.152 --> 26:47.623
Right back where we started.

26:47.690 --> 26:50.395
<i>Stacy said that she was afraid</i>

26:50.462 --> 26:53.634
that God would punish
her for having sex.

26:54.424 --> 26:56.272
I told her that was crazy.

26:57.976 --> 27:00.213
Guess I was wrong.

27:01.014 --> 27:03.477
Archie is not getting much
off of Hannah's computer.

27:03.496 --> 27:06.813
Most of her files
are encrypted AES-256.

27:06.879 --> 27:08.783
It's going to be nearly
impossible to crack.

27:08.850 --> 27:10.053
What do you mean by "most"?

27:10.120 --> 27:11.190
Well, it's not much,

27:11.256 --> 27:12.983
but apparently Hannah had IP access

27:13.018 --> 27:14.965
to the laser printer in
the high school library.

27:15.033 --> 27:17.439
Same one that printed the "Out
of Order" signs for the shower.

27:17.724 --> 27:20.441
If she printed those
signs, it shows intent.

27:21.415 --> 27:23.765
Ah, teen lust.

27:23.800 --> 27:25.819
Starts with some chemistry,
and then you mess around

27:25.854 --> 27:26.580
with some biology,

27:26.615 --> 27:29.344
and once you have some
experience "under your belt,"

27:29.379 --> 27:32.241
then you introduce the physics.

27:32.307 --> 27:34.879
Apparently, chivalry is not dead:

27:34.946 --> 27:36.116
the bloody fingerprint tested positive

27:36.183 --> 27:37.553
for nonoxynol spermicide.

27:37.620 --> 27:38.889
So much for the boyfriend.

27:38.956 --> 27:41.296
If we can't pin this
on Hannah or Marlon,

27:41.363 --> 27:43.935
they could both walk.

27:44.002 --> 27:45.873
You could flip a coin.

27:46.634 --> 27:48.112
I have a better idea.

27:52.522 --> 27:54.894
I bet you really liked high school.

27:54.961 --> 27:56.666
Yeah, playing football, chasing girls,

27:56.732 --> 27:58.737
books when I wanted to learn something
- what's not to like?

27:58.803 --> 27:59.596
Hey, guys.

27:59.631 --> 28:01.608
This is Darcy, my wife Tina's niece.

28:01.643 --> 28:02.646
Hi, Darcy.

28:02.647 --> 28:04.452
You were right; she's
about Hannah's size.

28:04.519 --> 28:05.370
More or less.

28:05.405 --> 28:07.159
Stop talking about me.

28:07.426 --> 28:08.995
Hey, that's the best part!

28:09.063 --> 28:10.952
That's what the pause button's for.

28:10.987 --> 28:13.138
It's time to work, it's child labor day.

28:14.275 --> 28:15.377
Okay.

28:15.445 --> 28:17.415
Crime started right here.

28:21.212 --> 28:22.695
Think you could reach that?

28:27.340 --> 28:28.677
It's kind of hard to sabotage

28:28.744 --> 28:30.280
a shower head you can't touch.

28:30.774 --> 28:32.652
Depends on what's behind the curtain.

28:34.444 --> 28:35.508
A stool.

28:36.616 --> 28:38.577
Just like the one in Hannah's bathroom.

28:39.069 --> 28:41.072
Try this.

28:47.053 --> 28:49.527
Hannah had access to the chem lab,

28:49.593 --> 28:51.565
and she knew how to handle sodium...

28:59.249 --> 29:01.889
Stacy would not have known what hit her.

29:01.955 --> 29:03.192
Or where she was going.

29:14.225 --> 29:15.762
Stacy landed here and bled out

29:15.829 --> 29:17.783
from the trauma to her skull.

29:18.939 --> 29:21.524
Darcy, why don't you put
those headphones back on?

29:21.559 --> 29:23.452
Like I didn't hear
what you guys just said?

29:24.522 --> 29:26.561
Hannah could have done this.

29:26.628 --> 29:27.866
Maybe.

29:27.932 --> 29:30.573
But the next part,
that was the toughest.

29:32.981 --> 29:34.452
It's too heavy!

29:34.520 --> 29:36.258
Come on, you're almost there!

29:36.803 --> 29:37.894
It's building character!

29:37.895 --> 29:39.566
It's slow going, but you're doing it.

29:39.634 --> 29:40.905
Yeah, so far.

29:41.228 --> 29:42.075
That's okay.

29:42.142 --> 29:43.746
Look, even if she makes it to the grass,

29:43.781 --> 29:45.351
you think she could've pulled the body

29:45.418 --> 29:46.823
the entire length of the football field?

29:46.889 --> 29:49.097
There were scratches
on the shower curtain-

29:49.163 --> 29:51.077
the body was dragged at
least part of the way.

29:51.112 --> 29:53.953
There's no way Hannah pulled
it the entire distance.

29:54.078 --> 29:55.816
Not by herself.

29:58.065 --> 29:59.393
They did it together.

29:59.869 --> 30:02.997
So... did I help the dead girl?

30:07.099 --> 30:09.528
If Marlon and Hannah
committed this crime together,

30:09.563 --> 30:11.391
then they're probably
still working as a team.

30:11.456 --> 30:12.661
It's all part of the plan:

30:12.727 --> 30:14.699
he confesses, then she confesses.

30:14.767 --> 30:16.038
Muddy the waters enough,

30:16.104 --> 30:18.023
they both get off on reasonable doubt.

30:19.247 --> 30:21.587
Well, if we can't get one
to implicate the other,

30:21.654 --> 30:23.125
we're screwed.

30:24.897 --> 30:26.001
I don't get it.

30:26.068 --> 30:27.171
What's wrong with you people?

30:27.237 --> 30:29.311
You want me to confess? Again?

30:29.378 --> 30:31.351
Fine, I will.

30:31.417 --> 30:34.503
Marlon, you need to confirm
that you're willing to talk to me

30:34.538 --> 30:37.590
without a parent or lawyer
present, just a child advocate.

30:37.999 --> 30:39.534
I already said that was okay.

30:39.569 --> 30:41.514
I killed Stacy, what else
do I have to tell you?

30:42.448 --> 30:44.991
Well, the truth works for me.

30:45.058 --> 30:45.909
I like the truth.

30:45.945 --> 30:47.471
Look, I don't need a lawyer,

30:47.506 --> 30:48.942
and I don't need my parents.

30:48.977 --> 30:50.344
I just want to do what's right.

30:50.380 --> 30:53.694
Hannah, taking the blame
for something you didn't do

30:53.729 --> 30:56.392
may be noble, but it
doesn't make it right.

30:56.987 --> 30:58.665
That's deep.

30:59.501 --> 31:00.438
Okay.

31:00.504 --> 31:01.707
It happened like this:

31:01.774 --> 31:04.484
Stacy humiliated me, I wanted revenge.

31:06.523 --> 31:08.222
Yeah, and you knew that
there was no way you were ever

31:08.289 --> 31:09.323
going to get it by yourself.

31:09.780 --> 31:11.223
You moved the body,

31:11.290 --> 31:13.757
you buried it...

31:13.823 --> 31:15.358
I know I did; I was there.

31:15.773 --> 31:16.948
What's the problem?

31:16.958 --> 31:19.059
Well, the problem is what
happened in the locker room.

31:19.957 --> 31:20.726
I mean, you're not the kind of guy

31:20.793 --> 31:23.692
who puts sodium in a shower
head to get back at somebody.

31:23.759 --> 31:25.226
You just trip them in the hallway.

31:26.893 --> 31:29.494
So you think I'm too
stupid to have done it.

31:29.561 --> 31:31.328
Great, join the club.

31:31.395 --> 31:33.594
I don't think you're stupid, Marlon,

31:33.661 --> 31:36.029
I didn't say you were stupid.

31:36.096 --> 31:38.296
But this is Hannah's game.

31:38.363 --> 31:39.797
The whole way.

31:39.863 --> 31:41.164
I broke into the chem lab.

31:41.230 --> 31:42.431
I stole the sodium.

31:42.497 --> 31:43.431
Me.

31:43.498 --> 31:44.564
All by myself.

31:44.631 --> 31:45.898
It takes skills

31:45.964 --> 31:47.466
to handle a chemical like that properly.

31:47.532 --> 31:51.366
And, quite frankly, man, you
just don't have the skills.

31:51.433 --> 31:53.550
Your prank went bad,
and Stacy ended up dead.

31:53.584 --> 31:54.468
That's what I said.

31:54.534 --> 31:55.933
Marlon helped you bury her.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.201
No. Why won't you believe me?

31:57.268 --> 31:58.501
Marlon wasn't there.

31:58.600 --> 32:00.301
Stay away from Hannah.

32:00.368 --> 32:02.235
She had nothing to do with this.

32:02.302 --> 32:05.969
No, no, she had
everything to do with this.

32:06.331 --> 32:07.650
You two were working
together from the beginning.

32:07.685 --> 32:08.636
Just leave her alone.

32:08.702 --> 32:10.493
Marlon helped you move the body.

32:10.529 --> 32:11.205
He didn't!

32:11.240 --> 32:13.909
You expect me to believe
that a little girl like you

32:13.944 --> 32:15.709
lugged a hundred pounds of dead weight

32:15.744 --> 32:17.610
the length of a football
field by yourself?

32:17.645 --> 32:18.372
No, of course not,

32:18.439 --> 32:20.173
that's why I had to use the cart.

32:21.541 --> 32:22.705
What cart?

32:22.773 --> 32:23.807
The electric cart.

32:23.873 --> 32:25.573
The one the landscapers were using.

32:25.640 --> 32:28.408
It was just sitting there,
right outside the door.

32:41.577 --> 32:43.710
Wait a minute.

32:45.379 --> 32:47.347
I got something.

32:47.592 --> 32:49.571
Let me clean up this image.

32:56.171 --> 32:57.515
I see a cart, Sara.

33:02.824 --> 33:04.516
So Hannah could be telling the truth.

33:04.607 --> 33:06.542
It's enough for reasonable doubt.

33:07.282 --> 33:10.242
Great. Thanks, Warrick.

33:20.098 --> 33:20.511
The evidence says

33:20.577 --> 33:22.245
either one of them could have done it,

33:22.279 --> 33:23.912
but I think they were in it together.

33:23.978 --> 33:25.946
Okay, I'll proceed against Marlon

33:26.013 --> 33:28.281
for the murder and bring
charges against Hannah

33:28.347 --> 33:29.281
for conspiracy.

33:29.347 --> 33:30.580
Another trial?

33:31.342 --> 33:33.242
You sure you want to go
through all this again?

33:33.277 --> 33:34.614
Stacy's parents and the community

33:34.681 --> 33:36.283
will have my ass if I don't.

33:36.349 --> 33:37.582
Well, then maybe this is good news.

33:37.649 --> 33:39.049
I was just going over Sofia's notes

33:39.116 --> 33:41.249
from the original investigation.

33:41.316 --> 33:42.750
The night of the murder,

33:42.817 --> 33:45.783
Hannah and Marlon's parents had
left them alone in the house.

33:46.075 --> 33:48.703
Pizza was delivered to the
residence around 9:00 p. m.

33:48.738 --> 33:50.759
That's right around Stacy's TOD.

33:50.794 --> 33:53.085
So, did anybody talk
to the delivery guy?

33:53.120 --> 33:55.786
Yes, and at the point that
Sofia did, a month had passed.

33:55.853 --> 33:57.714
Now, the delivery guy's
at the house all the time.

33:57.749 --> 34:00.237
He recognized photos of both kids,

34:00.272 --> 34:04.571
but he could not be sure
which one answered the door.

34:04.955 --> 34:07.190
But one of them did answer the door.

34:07.703 --> 34:09.889
So that means they were not together

34:09.956 --> 34:11.516
at the time Stacy was killed.

34:11.551 --> 34:13.041
Yeah. So much for conspiracy.

34:13.076 --> 34:14.583
We're right back where we started.

34:14.618 --> 34:16.092
Where we are is in the crapper.

34:16.158 --> 34:17.425
Look, I have to disclose the cart.

34:17.492 --> 34:19.259
Defense is going to eat me alive.

34:19.324 --> 34:20.725
Marlon's your guy.

34:20.792 --> 34:22.952
He's your guy
- just because Hannah wasn't there

34:22.987 --> 34:23.927
doesn't mean she didn't help plan this.

34:23.993 --> 34:26.494
Well, I sure hope it's
Marlon, because he's the one

34:26.562 --> 34:28.627
we have on trial.

34:29.453 --> 34:30.761
I stand by the case we filed.

34:31.293 --> 34:31.995
I agree.

34:32.690 --> 34:33.795
The girl's just trying to protect him.

34:35.579 --> 34:36.330
Sara?

34:41.938 --> 34:43.933
This was more about brains than brawn.

34:44.132 --> 34:45.534
I think Hannah did it.

34:48.355 --> 34:49.980
Two out of three.

34:50.800 --> 34:53.400
In my world, that's called an acquittal.

35:01.636 --> 35:02.903
High school.

35:03.528 --> 35:04.970
Even if you're popular,

35:05.247 --> 35:09.046
or a jock, or a brain...

35:09.112 --> 35:11.279
it can be hell.

35:11.952 --> 35:13.712
Everybody here remembers

35:13.779 --> 35:15.944
what it was like...

35:16.857 --> 35:17.910
what it was really like.

35:19.327 --> 35:20.639
Now take a look at Marlon West.

35:22.290 --> 35:26.362
Take a good, hard look.

35:27.806 --> 35:29.108
Not popular...

35:29.175 --> 35:33.207
not a jock... not a brain.

35:34.659 --> 35:39.805
Now imagine what it must
be like to be Marlon West

35:39.873 --> 35:43.403
day after day after day

35:43.438 --> 35:46.705
in the sociological pressure
cooker of high school.

35:47.659 --> 35:51.637
This imposing, struggling
outsider like Marlon

35:51.705 --> 35:53.170
resenting someone

35:53.237 --> 35:54.637
like Stacy Voler, who made it look

35:54.704 --> 36:00.536
so easy to be popular,
athletic and smart.

36:02.561 --> 36:05.967
That strong resentment
was already festering

36:06.035 --> 36:08.067
when Stacy made Marlon's
sister the object

36:08.134 --> 36:11.770
of a typical high school prank.

36:13.104 --> 36:15.799
And that is when Marlon, his resentment

36:15.866 --> 36:19.204
boiling over, crossed a line:

36:19.646 --> 36:22.896
He stalked Stacy.

36:23.347 --> 36:25.225
You've seen and heard evidence

36:25.260 --> 36:29.430
illustrating the elaborate pains
he took to rig a shower head

36:29.496 --> 36:31.629
to torture Stacy,

36:32.477 --> 36:37.428
how he forced her to run and fall,

36:37.495 --> 36:41.128
and watched her die in
a pool of her own blood.

36:42.900 --> 36:44.252
You know, for the
first time in his life,

36:44.286 --> 36:45.826
Marlon feels like a hero.

36:46.025 --> 36:47.925
He's not invisible anymore.

36:48.332 --> 36:50.493
He's a killer...

36:50.905 --> 36:55.652
and he is guilty beyond
all reasonable doubt.

36:57.292 --> 36:58.923
"Reasonable doubt".

36:58.990 --> 37:01.042
You know, I'm not surprised

37:01.042 --> 37:03.543
to hear the prosecution say those words,

37:03.610 --> 37:08.747
because its case offers
nothing but reasonable doubt.

37:09.522 --> 37:11.455
Access to sodium?!

37:11.489 --> 37:13.454
Marlon couldn't find sodium

37:13.489 --> 37:15.991
on a periodic table of the elements,

37:16.026 --> 37:18.494
let alone a locked supply closet.

37:19.146 --> 37:21.524
Access to library printers?

37:21.590 --> 37:25.680
Do you really think a kid like Marlon

37:25.715 --> 37:30.117
spends any time in a library?

37:31.330 --> 37:33.766
The shower head
- yes, Marlon's tall enough.

37:33.801 --> 37:36.599
He could reach it, but he still
would have had to have handled

37:36.634 --> 37:41.939
a volatile chemical with
expert safety precautions

37:42.007 --> 37:46.210
in order to orchestrate an explosion.

37:46.278 --> 37:47.610
I meanladies and gentlemen,

37:47.677 --> 37:49.578
do you know how to do that?

37:50.292 --> 37:52.282
I don't know how to do that.

37:53.040 --> 37:55.118
Right? You'd have to be...

37:55.955 --> 37:58.120
a genius.

38:01.954 --> 38:03.575
Marlon?

38:03.801 --> 38:06.182
Not a genius.

38:06.248 --> 38:07.448
You know, one of the underpinnings

38:07.515 --> 38:10.848
of our justice system
is that it is better

38:10.916 --> 38:18.510
to send a hundred guilty men
free than to imprison even one

38:18.546 --> 38:20.651
who's innocent.

38:20.716 --> 38:25.150
Marlon West is an innocent man.

38:25.836 --> 38:32.185
Reasonable doubt compels
you to find him not guilty.

39:01.029 --> 39:02.419
Defendant shall rise.

39:04.255 --> 39:05.490
Madam Foreman,

39:05.557 --> 39:07.123
what is the jury's verdict?

39:07.190 --> 39:09.523
On the sole count of
murder in the first degree,

39:09.590 --> 39:12.544
we, the jury, find the
defendant, Marlon West...

39:12.579 --> 39:13.939
not guilty.

39:19.257 --> 39:20.791
So noted.

39:20.857 --> 39:23.158
Court orders the defendant
released from custody.

39:23.641 --> 39:25.077
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

39:25.112 --> 39:26.159
thank you for your service.

39:26.924 --> 39:27.957
Court is adjourned.

39:58.263 --> 40:00.629
Sign here.

40:07.085 --> 40:08.748
Hey, there.

40:08.815 --> 40:10.812
Did you come to say bye?

40:11.078 --> 40:13.773
No. Actually, you and
I are going to be seeing

40:13.840 --> 40:15.006
a lot of each other.

40:15.072 --> 40:16.703
If you thought the DA wouldn't prosecute

40:16.769 --> 40:19.165
a 12-year-old for
murder, you were wrong.

40:19.233 --> 40:21.627
He wants justice for
Stacy and her family.

40:21.694 --> 40:24.857
Of course. He's a
totally linear thinker.

40:24.922 --> 40:26.587
Most of you guys are.

40:26.652 --> 40:28.683
Shame on you, Ms. Sidle.

40:28.749 --> 40:29.915
Come on, Hannah.

40:29.981 --> 40:31.279
You don't need to listen to this.

40:31.345 --> 40:33.875
Mom, just give us a second.

40:40.964 --> 40:42.761
You were saying?

40:45.356 --> 40:46.354
Here.

40:54.408 --> 40:56.672
Hannah, with your gifts,

40:56.739 --> 40:58.903
you could've done anything you wanted,

40:58.968 --> 41:01.065
and you picked murder.

41:01.132 --> 41:03.129
You can't take that back.

41:04.360 --> 41:06.490
You're worried how I'm going turn out.

41:06.556 --> 41:08.087
Of course I am.

41:08.155 --> 41:10.252
I know it seems like a really long time,

41:10.316 --> 41:12.747
but... in five years,

41:12.814 --> 41:15.709
the Stacies of the world
would've been behind you.

41:16.740 --> 41:18.072
Let me guess.

41:18.138 --> 41:19.735
You were a smart kid in school.

41:19.802 --> 41:22.531
Maybe you feel we're a little bit alike.

41:22.598 --> 41:24.827
There aren't many people like you.

41:24.894 --> 41:27.822
That's what my parents always say, too.

41:28.987 --> 41:31.751
The last four months,
all they cared about

41:31.816 --> 41:36.176
was the effect of the
trial on me... not Marlon.

41:36.242 --> 41:38.239
It's been that way

41:38.306 --> 41:40.070
ever since I was 14 months old

41:40.136 --> 41:42.898
and started spelling
words with plastic letters.

41:42.965 --> 41:46.226
It's so unfair, and nobody ever sees it.

41:48.256 --> 41:50.320
He doesn't deserve to go to jail.

41:53.086 --> 41:56.910
If I get convicted, what's
the worst-case scenario?

41:56.976 --> 41:58.708
I mean, I'll be out in five years

41:58.773 --> 42:00.837
with an undergraduate degree.

42:00.904 --> 42:03.036
There's no "Son of Sam" law in Nevada-

42:03.036 --> 42:04.811
that was ruled unconstitutional-

42:04.878 --> 42:07.591
so I'm free to write
a book about all this.

42:08.663 --> 42:10.406
The story'll be worth millions.

42:10.472 --> 42:13.185
Freaks are always good box office.

42:13.253 --> 42:15.363
You're not a freak.

42:16.133 --> 42:18.209
When's the last time you had to sit down

42:18.276 --> 42:20.956
to be eye-level with a murder
suspect who was standing up?

42:21.797 --> 42:23.033
Hannah, you are smart.

42:23.100 --> 42:24.258
So I've been told.

42:24.293 --> 42:26.751
But you're not smart enough
to get away with murder.

42:26.819 --> 42:28.426
I think I am.

42:28.494 --> 42:29.934
A lot of people are smart enough

42:30.000 --> 42:31.306
to get away with murder.

42:31.374 --> 42:33.417
You probably are, too.

42:33.484 --> 42:35.494
But you have to be really smart

42:35.561 --> 42:39.112
to make people think things
happened that never did.

42:40.150 --> 42:43.131
What do you mean, exactly?

42:43.197 --> 42:44.370
Please don't worry about me.

42:44.437 --> 42:46.548
I'm going to be fine.

42:51.136 --> 42:54.086
I didn't kill Stacy.

42:54.151 --> 42:57.642
Marlon did.
