00:22.689 --> 00:26.777
<i>Dispatch,
transport 25 inbound with 12 detainees.</i>

00:28.320 --> 00:30.155
Okay, bring them in.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.281
<i>Copy.</i>

00:31.907 --> 00:33.825
Why are they doing this?

00:35.244 --> 00:37.454
The police back Korzhenko.

00:38.914 --> 00:43.794
They are making an example of those
who ask questions.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.006
Just do what they say.

00:55.013 --> 00:56.598
Get out!

00:57.474 --> 00:58.809
Get out!

01:01.103 --> 01:02.437
Quiet!

01:03.480 --> 01:06.149
- Quickly!
- Feet apart!

01:06.149 --> 01:08.193
Hands forward!

01:08.193 --> 01:10.070
Face against the wall!

01:11.113 --> 01:12.573
Feet apart!

01:12.573 --> 01:13.949
Don't talk!

01:13.949 --> 01:15.325
Quiet!

02:51.046 --> 02:54.800
<i>At this hour, tanks surround
the Russian parliament building in Moscow.</i>

02:54.800 --> 02:58.554
<i>Some of them are operated by troops
loyal to the communist hard-liners</i>

02:58.554 --> 03:00.848
<i>who've taken control
of the Soviet government.</i>

03:01.640 --> 03:04.142
<i>Although both
the Defense Intelligence Agency</i>

03:04.142 --> 03:07.229
<i>and the Central Intelligence Agency have
been warning for months</i>

03:07.229 --> 03:09.606
<i>that Gorbachev's days in power
were numbered.</i>

03:09.606 --> 03:12.776
<i>The Soviet Defense Ministry urged calm,</i>

03:12.776 --> 03:17.781
<i>requesting that citizens remain inside
until the situation is resolved.</i>

03:17.781 --> 03:22.494
<i>The face of the coup is a man named
Fyodor Korzhenko, a longtime nationalist</i>

03:22.494 --> 03:26.832
<i>who says he intends to reverse
the corrupt Western-friendly policies</i>

03:26.832 --> 03:28.542
<i>of the Gorbachev regime</i>

03:28.542 --> 03:33.505
<i>and restore the Soviet Union to
traditional Marxist-Leninist principles.</i>

03:34.423 --> 03:37.843
<i>He leads a group of hard-liners
within the Soviet Communist Party--</i>

03:37.843 --> 03:41.138
<i>The president is expected
to condemn the coup within the hour.</i>

03:42.139 --> 03:45.893
<i>We should tell you,
Roscosmos and Star City,</i>

03:45.893 --> 03:48.103
<i>we haven't heard from them
in almost six hours.</i>

03:48.729 --> 03:52.733
<i>Commander Poole, our thoughts are
with our Russian comrades in Happy Valley.</i>

03:52.733 --> 03:54.568
<i>We hope their loved ones are safe.</i>

03:55.736 --> 03:57.237
<i>You be safe too.</i>

04:02.910 --> 04:05.704
Svetlana,
I know you have your own channels.

04:05.704 --> 04:08.582
Have you been able to reach anyone
at Star City?

04:08.582 --> 04:11.585
My coms-man is sending
tritone repeater every three minutes.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.338
- And nothing?
- It's not just Star City.

04:14.338 --> 04:18.132
My father sends message to me
every Saturday.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.845
This is first time I do not hear from him.

04:21.845 --> 04:25.557
Same with Pavel's wife
and Maxim's son, Antal.

04:26.141 --> 04:29.561
It's like Moscow just disappeared.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.523
I hate this not knowing.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.859
I'm sorry, Sveta.
I know how hard that can be.

04:37.486 --> 04:42.824
All personal Russian and cosmonaut video
messages need to take bandwidth priority.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.117
You got it.

04:44.618 --> 04:48.497
And if you want to postpone the
asteroid capture training mission, we can.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.666
No, we should proceed as planned.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.335
All right, good.

05:27.286 --> 05:28.662
Did you see that?

05:28.662 --> 05:30.247
That's a shooting star.

05:32.708 --> 05:34.710
That's the universe sending us a message.

05:36.170 --> 05:37.963
The universe doesn't send messages.

05:38.463 --> 05:39.673
How do you know?

05:39.673 --> 05:43.135
It's not sentient.
Doesn't give a damn about you and me.

05:43.135 --> 05:47.264
It's just a collection of random particles
careening through a void.

05:47.264 --> 05:49.099
Well, that's a message too. Isn't it?

05:50.142 --> 05:51.351
What are you--

05:52.436 --> 05:53.979
What are you doing here?

05:54.521 --> 05:56.940
This is a private beach.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.358
How did you even get here?

05:58.358 --> 06:02.696
I just went down that path over there.
Next to that monstrosity of a house.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.699
You missed the fence and sign that says,
"Keep out. Private property?"

06:05.699 --> 06:08.368
Oh, so that's-- that's your monstrosity?

06:10.162 --> 06:15.375
So-- So you-- you own like all that and--
and what? That's not enough?

06:16.084 --> 06:17.586
You want to claim the ocean too?

06:18.170 --> 06:19.713
I could just call the sheriff.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.340
Go ahead, you fascist pig.

06:53.789 --> 06:57.501
What we're pitching isn't your usual,
pie-in-the-sky,

06:57.501 --> 06:59.795
five-year-calendar aerospace project.

07:00.337 --> 07:02.714
All that hard work and proof of concept.

07:03.215 --> 07:06.218
It's done.
NASA already subsidized the whole thing.

07:06.218 --> 07:08.345
What do they say about aerospace?

07:09.096 --> 07:11.932
Every new project is like
jumping off a cliff

07:11.932 --> 07:14.101
and building an airplane on the way down.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.687
We're talking one of the most innovative,

07:16.687 --> 07:21.149
semi-autonomous, downright
beautiful projects NASA's ever backed.

07:21.149 --> 07:23.902
We call it the Mars S.E.E.K.E.R.

07:23.902 --> 07:25.779
A semi-autonomous robotic crawler

07:25.779 --> 07:30.492
designed to explore uncharted Martian lava
tubes, testing bedrock for proof of life.

07:30.492 --> 07:34.246
Prototype-gamma is on a literal shelf
at NASA right now.

07:34.246 --> 07:38.083
Gamma is the third in a planned fleet
of six to 12 operational S.E.E.K.E.R.s.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.084
Funds would...

07:39.084 --> 07:42.129
Buy cargo space for S.E.E.K.E.R.s
on future Mars launches.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.673
Provide setup of a small mission control
at Happy Valley.

07:44.673 --> 07:48.343
And fund a full-time engineering team
to run the project on Mars.

07:48.343 --> 07:54.558
To find the signatures of life that once
existed, that maybe still exist right now.

07:54.558 --> 07:56.435
Kelly, let me stop you there.

07:56.435 --> 08:01.565
So well pitched,
but we have several other projects...

08:01.565 --> 08:03.233
In this exact same space.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.485
It just doesn't fit our development slate.

08:05.485 --> 08:09.573
I appreciate the passion, but frankly,

08:09.573 --> 08:13.410
we're not in a position to take such
a financial risk at this time.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.543
That sucked.

08:23.962 --> 08:28.300
What's two hundred million to a company
worth more than the GDP of Texas?

08:32.386 --> 08:35.265
I can think of someone else
worth just about the same.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.227
You really think he'd go for it?

08:39.227 --> 08:40.812
Only one way to find out.

08:57.746 --> 09:01.625
<i>You like it? It's super easy.
It's called</i> Pixel Paint.

09:01.625 --> 09:03.085
<i>Let's wrap it up.</i>

09:03.085 --> 09:04.461
<i>Okay</i>.

09:04.461 --> 09:09.633
<i>Mom says I gotta go. You're still sending
me a Mars rock, right? Love you, Daddy.</i>

09:11.593 --> 09:12.594
<i>Bye.</i>

09:13.387 --> 09:16.265
<i>Okay. Hey.</i>

09:17.975 --> 09:19.977
<i>Sarah's at Melinda's.</i>

09:19.977 --> 09:22.604
<i>Sorry, I thought she would be back
in time.</i>

09:22.604 --> 09:25.732
<i>Anyway, we should talk.</i>

09:26.316 --> 09:30.821
<i>My sister said that there might be a job
for me at the company she works for</i>

09:30.821 --> 09:32.364
<i>up in Boise.</i>

09:32.364 --> 09:34.658
<i>I've seen the latest deposit.</i>

09:34.658 --> 09:37.870
<i>I'm sure you're just as frustrated
about it as I am.</i>

09:37.870 --> 09:41.039
<i>But something's got to change
because this ain't working.</i>

09:41.874 --> 09:43.584
<i>You're millions of miles away</i>

09:43.584 --> 09:47.004
<i>and if you can't make the money
that you thought then,</i>

09:48.046 --> 09:50.591
<i>you know,
what are you even doing up there, Miles?</i>

09:53.802 --> 09:55.470
<i>Anyway, I'll talk to you later.</i>

09:59.975 --> 10:01.059
Letter from home?

10:02.227 --> 10:03.312
Yeah.

10:03.312 --> 10:06.190
Guessing it was a doozy, too,
based on that hangdog look of yours.

10:06.690 --> 10:10.110
No, I was just-- I thought it would be
different up here but it's the same shit.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.320
Well, count yourself lucky.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.155
Know how many vidmails I got last month?

10:13.155 --> 10:14.406
Big fat zero.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.116
Really?

10:17.367 --> 10:18.827
You have any family down there?

10:18.827 --> 10:20.162
My husband.

10:20.871 --> 10:22.873
I mean, my ex-husband.

10:22.873 --> 10:27.252
He did that whole quickie divorce thing.
Ten days before blast off.

10:27.252 --> 10:28.629
Shit. Sorry.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.883
Don't be.
He wanted kids and I wanted to go to Mars.

10:32.883 --> 10:35.636
But let's go drown our sorrows, shall we?

10:50.776 --> 10:51.777
You gotta catch it.

11:07.459 --> 11:11.213
How much do you think Ilya makes?
Getting all this stuff for these people?

11:12.130 --> 11:15.676
Let's see, I gave him 20 bucks last week
to get me tampons

11:15.676 --> 11:18.554
better than the glorified TP rolls
they sell in the PX.

11:19.346 --> 11:22.850
I gave him ten dollars
for all-cotton undies.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.643
Three bucks for drinks.

11:25.269 --> 11:28.605
He hauls in $40 to $50 from me
a month alone.

11:28.605 --> 11:31.900
So times that by however many people
you see coming in here every day.

11:32.442 --> 11:35.195
And I'd say he makes a shitload. Yeah.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.536
Do you want another?

11:43.036 --> 11:44.705
- If you're buying.
- Oh, yeah.

11:59.511 --> 12:01.555
- What?
- Two more, please.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.850
Coming right up. You got lemon, right?

12:09.104 --> 12:11.440
You seem to have everything figured out
up here, Ilya.

12:12.399 --> 12:15.527
Other than that fucking still. So slow.

12:16.653 --> 12:20.449
But you'll come to learn, my friend.
Give it time.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.661
Don't know about that. I'm a grand shy
of what I need every month,

12:24.661 --> 12:26.288
and my wife is not happy.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.666
Helios, they are a shit company.

12:29.666 --> 12:32.002
They're greedy and they're cheats.

12:32.002 --> 12:35.923
I worked for them for 15 years.
First on Moon, now here.

12:37.508 --> 12:39.760
So one day I said to myself,

12:39.760 --> 12:44.640
"Fine, you want to rig game?
I can do same, only better than you."

12:45.390 --> 12:48.644
When I started on Moon,
we were just small operation.

12:48.644 --> 12:52.147
Jack Daniel's, cigarettes,
some pornography.

12:52.147 --> 12:55.317
The classy stuff, Playboy, Penthouse.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.654
But it was a tough market.

13:00.405 --> 13:03.200
Here, business much better.

13:04.409 --> 13:07.538
That's great, man.
But what about NASA? Do they know?

13:08.830 --> 13:11.542
I'm very careful. Always.

13:12.668 --> 13:15.671
Man on moon who took over after I left,

13:16.463 --> 13:18.006
he was caught.

13:18.006 --> 13:21.510
They charged him with tax evasion.

13:22.553 --> 13:23.929
Fucking idiot.

13:27.224 --> 13:30.185
So, Ilya, do you ever need like,
I don't know.

13:30.185 --> 13:32.938
Do you-- Do you need help?
Like an extra pair of hands?

13:35.023 --> 13:36.775
I prefer to work alone.

13:37.568 --> 13:40.153
As I said, I must be careful.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.489
Yeah, I understand. I got it.
I just thought that maybe--

13:42.489 --> 13:44.408
Don't be a fucking moron.

13:44.408 --> 13:46.618
Don't you know what Miles's day job is?

13:47.870 --> 13:51.373
He repairs environmental systems
all over the base.

13:51.373 --> 13:54.585
Restricted areas, down and up.

13:54.585 --> 13:56.879
- Which means he's got a...
- Green badge.

13:58.046 --> 14:00.299
He can get to parts of the base
you never could.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.719
But, hey, what do I know?

14:11.977 --> 14:12.978
Okay.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.231
Maybe we'll do test run.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.862
Meet me tomorrow, loading dock B.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.155
Sure thing.

14:24.114 --> 14:25.115
Thank you.

14:36.293 --> 14:37.294
Thank you.

14:38.045 --> 14:40.547
For what?
All I did was point out the obvious.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.299
Yeah.

14:42.299 --> 14:44.259
You do owe me another drink though.

14:48.138 --> 14:49.848
They demand, we supply.

14:49.848 --> 14:55.437
Now remember, this is customer service.
Smile, but not too big.

14:55.437 --> 14:58.524
Just a little smile.
And look customer in the eye.

14:58.524 --> 15:01.735
<i>We want them to think of us
when they need something.</i>

15:01.735 --> 15:02.861
One, two or three?

15:02.861 --> 15:05.197
<i>And make them feel like they're home.</i>

15:06.490 --> 15:09.201
Here. Write everything down.

15:10.118 --> 15:12.955
Always with pencil, no computer.

15:13.872 --> 15:17.543
What kind, how many. Always precise.

15:19.211 --> 15:22.297
<i>Then I'll take order, send down to Earth.</i>

15:22.297 --> 15:25.926
<i>And my partner there,
he finds item, gets it on ship.</i>

15:31.473 --> 15:32.474
And how does that work?

15:32.474 --> 15:35.185
Do you have a secret compartment
in the cargo hold or something?

15:35.185 --> 15:38.981
<i>First things first, Milosh.
All in good time.</i>

15:41.984 --> 15:43.068
Hey, Ilya.

16:00.502 --> 16:03.714
<i>Now you always ask for scrip first.</i>

16:05.382 --> 16:06.675
<i>Then hand the package</i>.

16:07.301 --> 16:10.179
And you let me know
if there's anything else you need.

16:10.179 --> 16:13.515
Always smile. Bigger smile. Good.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.026
Be more careful upstairs.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.988
That asshole Palmer,
he has a hard-on for me.

16:32.367 --> 16:33.619
<i>So be nice</i>.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.205
<i>Be quick</i>.

16:37.414 --> 16:39.541
<i>In and out. Ticktock.</i>

16:40.501 --> 16:41.752
What's up, Miles.

16:50.302 --> 16:51.678
Thanks, man.

16:58.810 --> 17:01.563
You must start thinking different now, Milosh.

17:02.272 --> 17:04.358
<i>You notice someone needs something.</i>

17:06.068 --> 17:08.987
<i>Suggest maybe you have solution for this.</i>

17:09.946 --> 17:14.326
<i>Always be thinking ahead. Nothing is free.</i>

17:15.160 --> 17:18.955
This is Russian way.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.083
Say it.

17:28.841 --> 17:31.593
Getting close to zero, relative motion.

17:31.593 --> 17:34.096
And once we've matched our spin
with the docking platform,

17:34.096 --> 17:36.098
I'll refine our ring alignment.

17:37.182 --> 17:40.102
Okay. Got the spin matched nicely.

17:42.396 --> 17:44.022
<i>Ranger, Happy Valley.</i>

17:44.022 --> 17:46.692
<i>You are go to proceed
with docking procedure test.</i>

17:47.484 --> 17:48.485
Copy that.

17:48.485 --> 17:51.154
I'd rather be dancing
with an actual asteroid.

17:51.154 --> 17:55.617
Just the easy touch-and-go. Closure rate
holding steady at one meter per second.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.704
Thirty meters.

18:09.798 --> 18:12.009
<i>We're reading a 12168.</i>

18:13.552 --> 18:15.012
Controls are a bit sluggish.

18:16.180 --> 18:17.973
Fifteen meters.

18:26.982 --> 18:29.526
Sveta, you've been simming this all week.

18:31.028 --> 18:32.321
Wanna try it for real?

18:34.573 --> 18:36.450
Yes, Commander.

18:36.450 --> 18:37.868
Your controls.

18:40.078 --> 18:41.413
I have control.

18:41.914 --> 18:42.956
Okay, ten meters.

18:49.421 --> 18:52.674
Go easy on the translation.
Allow for the lag when in the low.

18:55.928 --> 18:58.931
Four meters.
Approaching docking of the platform.

19:01.058 --> 19:03.852
One meter. Keep her steady.

19:09.650 --> 19:11.151
<i>Docking complete.</i>

19:12.945 --> 19:16.490
Nicely done, Sveta. Nicely done.

19:34.842 --> 19:37.886
This is a mistake. I'm a Canadian citizen.

19:37.886 --> 19:39.304
Move!

20:19.803 --> 20:21.597
Twelve hours and 13 minutes.

20:22.347 --> 20:24.224
Interview room 7.

20:24.224 --> 20:27.477
Police Lieutenant Stepan Gura.

20:27.477 --> 20:30.314
Interview with Margaret Reynolds.

20:31.273 --> 20:36.320
I think there is a misunderstanding.

20:37.738 --> 20:41.992
I was at a newsstand buying a paper when--

20:41.992 --> 20:45.996
Ms. Reynolds,
your Russian is not bad, but--

20:47.206 --> 20:49.666
but I will conduct
in your mother tongue, no?

20:51.668 --> 20:56.173
Yes, that would be better.
Now if you would call my consulate--

20:56.173 --> 20:59.301
We will do this.
But first, I have questions.

21:00.344 --> 21:01.720
What is your profession?

21:04.056 --> 21:05.682
I'm a business consultant.

21:06.433 --> 21:10.646
I facilitate deals
between Soviet and Western corporations.

21:10.646 --> 21:17.110
So you're, of course, aware foreigners who
take part in anti-government activities

21:17.110 --> 21:18.695
fall under Soviet law?

21:18.695 --> 21:21.198
Yes, but I have not violated any--

21:21.198 --> 21:25.035
You were arrested
as part of illegal political demonstration

21:25.035 --> 21:28.830
against orderly government transition, correct?

21:29.331 --> 21:34.628
No, that's not--
As I said, I was at a-a newsstand when--

21:34.628 --> 21:40.050
When you interfered with a Soviet police
officer in performance of his duties.

21:41.802 --> 21:44.429
However, there's bigger concern to us.

22:10.414 --> 22:11.498
Who gave you this?

22:16.086 --> 22:18.338
- I don't know.
- Yet you chose to hide it.

22:18.839 --> 22:19.840
I was just keeping it--

22:19.840 --> 22:24.636
The prefix is assigned
to the Third Chief Directorate of the KGB.

22:26.054 --> 22:29.933
The Third Directorate is currently
opposing constitutional transfer

22:29.933 --> 22:32.060
of government power to Korzhenko.

22:38.692 --> 22:42.946
Right now you are held here
under Article 70,

22:42.946 --> 22:45.782
which does not allow for extreme penalty.

22:46.783 --> 22:52.039
But if we were to find that you are here
under false pretense,

22:52.623 --> 22:56.877
working with a corrupt Gorbachev regime
against our nation,

22:57.878 --> 23:03.091
this will be a supplementary circumstance
leading to a charge under Article 64.

23:04.676 --> 23:06.178
"Betrayal of Motherland."

23:07.930 --> 23:12.351
Punishment for this can be
as little as ten years in work camp.

23:13.519 --> 23:16.021
Or as much as death.

23:16.939 --> 23:19.608
But if you were to tell me
what I want to know,

23:19.608 --> 23:20.943
perhaps I could help you.

23:23.278 --> 23:24.696
Please--

23:47.469 --> 23:49.012
Follow me! Follow me!

23:49.012 --> 23:50.430
I'm behind you!

24:16.748 --> 24:19.251
- You okay?
- Yeah, I am fine.

24:21.795 --> 24:25.424
My side is stone cold bitch
ever since Kronos mission.

24:25.424 --> 24:27.467
Bet that maneuver
didn't help either, did it?

24:27.467 --> 24:29.720
I feel like I was kicked by a horse.

24:31.388 --> 24:34.016
Nothing Mayakovsky gives me
helps the pain.

24:41.607 --> 24:43.317
Why don't you come to my garden.

24:44.943 --> 24:48.030
After 2200, greenhouse-C.

24:48.822 --> 24:49.823
Why?

24:52.409 --> 24:53.744
Because I asked.

24:56.163 --> 25:00.501
Well, then how can I refuse.

25:12.513 --> 25:13.514
<i>Come in</i>.

25:14.681 --> 25:15.933
This is gonna be great.

25:23.190 --> 25:24.191
Hello?

25:25.025 --> 25:26.109
In here.

25:33.242 --> 25:36.870
My team developed techniques
way beyond ice cores and water samples,

25:37.788 --> 25:40.707
detecting the signatures of life
from the rocks themselves

25:41.333 --> 25:43.377
all thanks to your robotic crawlers.

25:43.377 --> 25:45.879
NASA sends me copies
of all your test results.

25:45.879 --> 25:47.297
You've done some remarkable work.

25:48.382 --> 25:50.717
But you still have not answered
the crucial question.

25:50.717 --> 25:51.802
Which is?

25:52.845 --> 25:54.763
What's the potential return
on my investment?

25:56.265 --> 25:57.766
If we find life,

25:57.766 --> 26:00.727
we map its genome, unfold its proteins,

26:02.062 --> 26:03.564
find its secrets.

26:04.189 --> 26:07.192
And in doing that
we might find the secrets to ourselves.

26:07.985 --> 26:11.238
I mean, who knows what advances
in biotech might come out of that?

26:12.281 --> 26:14.157
I'm still not seeing the ROI in this.

26:14.157 --> 26:16.159
You can't take epiphanies to the bank.

26:16.159 --> 26:17.494
I don't get it.

26:18.829 --> 26:22.833
I thought you were all about discovery,
exploring the universe.

26:22.833 --> 26:26.712
Look, I am so flattered that you guys came
all the way out here to see me

26:26.712 --> 26:29.840
and I am sorry
that I can't be more helpful,

26:29.840 --> 26:33.051
but this-- this isn't for me.

26:34.595 --> 26:35.971
I'm sorry.

26:41.643 --> 26:42.644
Thank you.

26:46.732 --> 26:47.983
Wait that's it?

26:50.235 --> 26:51.236
Yeah, I think so.

27:00.829 --> 27:01.955
You know what?

27:04.041 --> 27:05.167
You're full of shit.

27:09.046 --> 27:11.215
I remember when my mom
first went to work for you.

27:11.757 --> 27:14.218
She told me she had never met
someone so passionate

27:14.218 --> 27:15.928
about changing the world for the better.

27:16.929 --> 27:22.476
All your big plans to colonize Mars,
the moons of Saturn, Jupiter.

27:23.852 --> 27:26.188
And now you're holed up in Shangri-La

27:26.188 --> 27:29.149
watching your bank accounts grow
bigger and bigger,

27:30.150 --> 27:32.569
afraid to step foot outside of your house.

27:33.612 --> 27:35.280
What the hell happened to you?

27:36.281 --> 27:39.368
You want to know what happened to me,
Kelly? Your mother.

27:40.494 --> 27:42.037
She stabbed me in the back.

27:43.705 --> 27:46.166
But I'm grateful. I am.

27:46.834 --> 27:48.752
Because she pulled the wool from my eyes

27:49.419 --> 27:53.173
and helped me to see people
for what they really are.

28:11.900 --> 28:13.151
Fuck.

28:14.528 --> 28:16.405
Yeah, maybe I shouldn't have
brought up my mom.

28:16.989 --> 28:18.073
You think?

28:22.452 --> 28:23.537
Beautiful.

28:26.623 --> 28:28.333
I must say I'm impressed.

28:30.002 --> 28:31.962
You do not strike me as a farmer type.

28:34.089 --> 28:38.969
Well, Kelly, my daughter,
she's the real green thumb in the family.

28:38.969 --> 28:41.305
You know, she grew
the first plants on Mars?

28:42.806 --> 28:44.266
For me, it's more like a hobby.

28:44.975 --> 28:49.271
I used to putter around in the garden in
Houston back on the weekends with Karen.

28:51.940 --> 28:52.941
My wife.

28:52.941 --> 28:54.735
I know who she was, Edward.

28:56.361 --> 28:58.655
Whole world knows Karen Baldwin.

29:05.579 --> 29:09.416
It makes me feel close to her,
working here.

29:10.667 --> 29:12.920
Not in a sad way.

29:12.920 --> 29:17.049
Just makes me feel good. You know?

29:22.513 --> 29:26.517
My father,
he used to be a gardener for Brezhnev.

29:28.393 --> 29:30.437
At his dacha on Black Sea.

29:32.272 --> 29:37.152
When I was little
I worked beside him in gardens.

29:41.406 --> 29:42.866
The smell here...

29:48.705 --> 29:49.957
reminds me of him.

29:57.840 --> 30:00.467
I wish I would get message from him
telling me he's okay.

30:00.467 --> 30:03.053
You'll hear from him soon. I'm sure.

30:12.563 --> 30:13.564
Hey...

30:16.567 --> 30:18.110
I got something for you.

30:30.372 --> 30:35.169
But yeah,
you can't tell anyone about this ever.

30:35.752 --> 30:37.004
My lips are sealed--

30:37.004 --> 30:38.505
- Ever.
- Ever.

30:49.391 --> 30:51.185
Edward.

30:57.316 --> 30:59.610
No, it's pot. Marijuana.

31:00.194 --> 31:02.070
- I know.
- Okay.

31:03.155 --> 31:04.740
How did you get it up here?

31:05.574 --> 31:09.411
Well, Karen had this friend, Wayne.

31:09.411 --> 31:12.998
He gave me some seeds
to help me with my aches and pains

31:12.998 --> 31:16.210
and I planted the suckers
and they just took off.

31:27.095 --> 31:28.555
No.

31:31.767 --> 31:34.937
This is for your back.

31:40.275 --> 31:42.319
Okay, you just hold your finger on that.

31:43.737 --> 31:46.698
- Like that?
- Yeah, then you inhale.

31:47.282 --> 31:48.700
And then let it go.

31:51.537 --> 31:52.746
There you go.

31:54.164 --> 31:55.499
You hold it in.

32:03.215 --> 32:04.466
I'm sorry.

32:04.466 --> 32:07.636
No, that just means you're doing it right.

32:10.055 --> 32:13.308
You treat this like any pain medicine,
you gotta be clean before you fly.

32:13.308 --> 32:16.311
For at least eight hours. I know.

32:21.733 --> 32:22.860
Amazing.

32:34.454 --> 32:39.042
You say you smoke
to help your aches and pains?

32:57.936 --> 32:58.937
Yeah.

32:58.937 --> 33:00.439
What's wrong with them?

33:04.234 --> 33:05.527
I don't know.

34:53.719 --> 34:55.554
I'm Colonel Vidor Kolikoff.

34:58.348 --> 34:59.433
Thank you.

35:00.184 --> 35:04.313
I'm sorry you got caught up
in our... politics.

35:05.939 --> 35:07.441
I assure you,

35:07.441 --> 35:12.070
the army is working to restore order
and return Mr. Gorbachev to power.

35:13.071 --> 35:15.282
Now please, if you'd indulge me.

35:29.087 --> 35:31.173
To his knees.

35:39.932 --> 35:43.310
Now, tell me about the card

35:43.310 --> 35:45.604
that you found on her.

35:47.689 --> 35:49.024
Please.

35:49.024 --> 35:50.609
Stop.

35:50.609 --> 35:51.693
I cannot.

35:57.324 --> 35:59.368
I'm asking you again.

35:59.368 --> 36:01.578
Tell me about the card.

36:05.499 --> 36:08.877
You called the number and who...

36:10.087 --> 36:12.256
...who answered?

36:12.256 --> 36:18.220
The man said it was a watch repair shop.

36:18.220 --> 36:22.432
I told him I found the number
in the possession of Margaret Reynolds.

36:22.432 --> 36:24.309
Then?

36:25.435 --> 36:27.646
My call was transferred

36:28.480 --> 36:31.733
and another man picked up.

36:31.733 --> 36:35.362
He said Margaret Reynolds is
one of their most valued customers.

36:37.239 --> 36:41.743
He told me I did well to call him.

36:42.244 --> 36:43.787
Who gave you that card?

36:47.541 --> 36:49.209
The woman didn't give me her name.

36:52.880 --> 36:55.674
That number reaches a trap line

36:55.674 --> 36:59.887
that redirects
to the Second Directorate of the KGB.

37:01.013 --> 37:03.015
You weren't just talking to the KGB.

37:03.015 --> 37:07.895
You were talking to the KGB
who watch the rest of KGB.

37:10.564 --> 37:15.777
Counterintelligence.
They're the ones backing Korzhenko.

37:15.777 --> 37:19.198
They are the ones behind the coup.

37:26.246 --> 37:27.956
The man on the phone

37:29.082 --> 37:30.709
did he tell you who she is?

37:34.880 --> 37:35.797
No.

38:02.407 --> 38:03.534
What are you--

38:18.382 --> 38:22.177
The woman who gave you the card,
what did she look like?

38:25.722 --> 38:27.057
Sixties, maybe?

38:28.141 --> 38:29.726
I don't know who she is.

38:29.726 --> 38:31.895
I just spoke to her for a moment.

38:34.815 --> 38:36.149
What are you to her?

38:36.149 --> 38:38.610
I don't know what you're talking about,
I swear.

38:40.279 --> 38:44.074
You will tell me
everything that you know about this woman.

39:02.885 --> 39:04.011
What are you doing?

39:04.011 --> 39:05.179
Hey.

39:06.597 --> 39:08.724
Found this compressor
in the suit soop's room.

39:08.724 --> 39:11.351
And I remember what you were saying
about <i>svyazi.</i>

39:11.852 --> 39:15.898
And I know how you're always complaining
that your still is too slow, so...

39:17.065 --> 39:19.610
Wow. Thank you, Milosh.

39:20.861 --> 39:23.697
Think nothing of it.
All right, check it out?

39:24.281 --> 39:25.282
Sure.

39:39.588 --> 39:41.173
Turn it off! Turn it off!

39:48.931 --> 39:51.808
- No shi--
- Son of bitch. Fuck!

39:51.808 --> 39:53.977
Your compressor broke my still!

39:53.977 --> 39:57.439
Hang on, hang on. Let me check it out.

39:57.940 --> 39:58.899
Fuck.

40:00.901 --> 40:02.027
Fuck.

40:02.027 --> 40:03.529
Oh, shit.

40:04.404 --> 40:05.864
Yeah, your thermostat's fried.

40:09.201 --> 40:14.623
I need cooling coil
to condense alcohol back to liquid.

40:15.457 --> 40:18.710
No coil, no booze! Huh?

40:27.594 --> 40:30.180
You should have just left
well enough alone.

40:30.180 --> 40:31.515
I vouched for you, Miles.

40:31.515 --> 40:32.891
I know. I'm sorry.

40:33.392 --> 40:35.060
How long is the still going to be down?

40:35.060 --> 40:36.645
He said a couple of months.

40:36.645 --> 40:39.314
He's got to order a new thermostat
and have it shipped up here.

40:40.899 --> 40:43.193
He must be so pissed.

40:43.193 --> 40:45.863
I've never seen a human head get
that red before.

40:45.863 --> 40:49.449
I mean, he told me where I could
stick that job, that's for sure.

40:51.410 --> 40:52.786
Sorry, man.

40:52.786 --> 40:56.206
Looks like all the thermostats like that
one have been replaced by newer models.

40:56.206 --> 40:57.958
Fuck. I knew this would happen.

40:57.958 --> 41:00.460
Just when I'm starting
to make head way up here, you know.

41:00.460 --> 41:04.965
It's just a little setback is all.
I'm sure he'll get over it eventually.

41:04.965 --> 41:06.258
Hang on.

41:07.426 --> 41:08.844
Now that's interesting.

41:09.553 --> 41:11.054
Wait, what is?

41:11.054 --> 41:12.681
There's still one more on base.

41:13.348 --> 41:14.808
<i>Uno momento</i>.

41:16.476 --> 41:17.644
Oh, boy.

41:17.644 --> 41:18.812
What?

41:19.646 --> 41:21.440
The North Koreans have it.

41:22.024 --> 41:24.067
North Koreans? As in it's in their area?

41:24.067 --> 41:25.402
Yeah.

41:25.402 --> 41:26.904
Shit.

41:28.488 --> 41:29.615
Okay.

41:30.324 --> 41:31.825
Okay, that's not insurmountable.

41:31.825 --> 41:36.288
I'll just-- No, I could--
I'll go over there and I'll talk to 'em.

41:36.288 --> 41:37.706
You can't be serious.

41:37.706 --> 41:41.418
That was Palmer's number one rule.
Stay away from North Korea.

41:41.418 --> 41:42.669
How bad can it be?

41:42.669 --> 41:45.297
I mean, they're up here,
we're up here, we're not that different.

41:45.297 --> 41:50.427
Yeah, but North Korean territory on
this base is akin to actual North Korea.

41:51.094 --> 41:54.306
You're basically saying
you're just gonna walk up to the DMZ

41:54.306 --> 41:55.766
and knock on the front door?

41:55.766 --> 41:58.685
Well, yeah.
I mean, strength in numbers right?

42:01.355 --> 42:02.940
No fucking way.

42:04.441 --> 42:07.861
No, I'm on borrowed time as is with this
whole accident report thing coming out.

42:07.861 --> 42:11.406
I've got to be perfect if I want to get
reassigned to the asteroid program.

42:12.783 --> 42:15.118
What about you? You up for an adventure?

42:16.495 --> 42:17.788
Yeah, that's a no from me.

42:18.372 --> 42:20.749
Palmer scares me. A lot.

43:15.179 --> 43:16.305
What is it?

43:16.305 --> 43:18.056
It is an elevated methane warning.

43:18.056 --> 43:19.725
Check the auxiliary flow sensors.

43:19.725 --> 43:20.809
Yes, sir.

43:30.694 --> 43:34.031
I need to check your air quality levels.
There could be a leak.

43:36.074 --> 43:37.201
Come on, open up.

43:40.662 --> 43:41.914
You are not allowed.

43:54.968 --> 43:56.386
Methane.

43:56.386 --> 43:58.096
What do they want?

43:58.847 --> 44:00.224
Entry!

44:00.224 --> 44:01.767
Denied!

44:03.810 --> 44:05.395
You cannot come--

44:09.107 --> 44:13.028
I heard tanks were surrounding The Kremlin
and Gorbachev--

44:14.821 --> 44:19.576
Ma'am. A possible cooling system leak
in the North Korean module.

44:21.662 --> 44:25.624
There's already a Helios tech at the site.
You can reset the alert.

44:36.301 --> 44:39.137
Listen, all your people need to leave.

44:39.137 --> 44:42.432
I need to check your air quality levels.
Could be dangerous.

44:42.432 --> 44:45.435
This is the sovereign territory of
the People's Republic of Korea.

44:45.435 --> 44:48.355
Listen, buddy. You want to choke to death,
but that's your business.

44:48.355 --> 44:50.065
I have a job to do.

44:50.065 --> 44:54.069
Okay, this is a safety issue,
you understand? Safety.

44:54.069 --> 44:56.321
He says it is a safety issue.

44:56.321 --> 44:57.865
We must evacuate.

45:06.248 --> 45:08.584
We are temporarily evacuating the module.

45:39.990 --> 45:43.577
Nobody comes back in here
until I give the all clear.

46:50.686 --> 46:52.521
Shit. Scared me there.

46:55.566 --> 46:57.609
Well, false alarm.

46:58.193 --> 47:00.404
The air is clear.
No sign of contamination.

47:00.988 --> 47:02.406
Probably just a faulty sensor.

47:02.406 --> 47:05.117
You know, happened a couple of times
that I've been up here.

47:05.117 --> 47:08.495
- Power surge hits the sensor gauge--
- What is in case?

47:13.876 --> 47:16.378
- I--
- You put that recording device--

47:16.378 --> 47:18.213
No, no. I'm a repairman.

47:18.213 --> 47:22.301
Show me what is in case, sir.
Or I report American espionage.

47:24.094 --> 47:25.637
No, no. You got the wrong idea.

47:25.637 --> 47:28.599
Look, sir, I'm not-- They're--
I'm not a spook.

47:29.349 --> 47:30.642
- No?
- No.

47:33.604 --> 47:35.647
Then what did you put in case?

47:46.742 --> 47:52.122
Thermostat. I needed it
and yours is the only one on base.

47:52.915 --> 47:54.124
I'm sorry.

48:02.299 --> 48:03.717
Why you need?

48:03.717 --> 48:08.555
There's this bar, you know,
where you drink alcohol.

48:12.184 --> 48:15.395
You are with Breshov? Ilya?

48:15.395 --> 48:16.855
You know Ilya?

48:16.855 --> 48:19.191
I know of smuggling.

48:21.693 --> 48:25.614
We have eyes all over base.

48:25.614 --> 48:29.451
Listen, I apologize for everything.

48:30.077 --> 48:32.287
This was stupid. I'm just gonna take it.
I'm gonna put--

48:32.287 --> 48:33.872
No.

48:36.959 --> 48:41.672
You keep, but I need you to help me.

48:48.470 --> 48:50.806
Maybe we're going about this all wrong.

48:50.806 --> 48:53.308
We could go for an international partner.

48:54.017 --> 48:55.018
ESA?

48:55.018 --> 48:58.605
- Or the Chinese. They have a lot of money.
- Yeah. That's cool. Let me try.

48:58.605 --> 49:00.023
There you go.

49:03.485 --> 49:05.946
- Here she is.
- Dev?

49:05.946 --> 49:09.199
Kelly. Come here.

49:09.199 --> 49:10.659
Mommy, watch this.

49:10.659 --> 49:13.161
So, here. So, the coin's in this hand.

49:13.871 --> 49:16.206
Three, two, one.

49:18.166 --> 49:19.168
Abracadabra.

49:19.960 --> 49:21.628
Where did it go?

49:26.300 --> 49:27.801
- Darn it.
- Come, Alexei.

49:29.511 --> 49:31.096
Hey, keep working at it, young Alex.

49:36.059 --> 49:37.895
How did you get here before us?

49:37.895 --> 49:39.897
Helps if you have your own jet.

49:40.981 --> 49:42.733
What do you want, Dev?

49:43.442 --> 49:45.652
To apologize
for what I said about your mom.

49:46.904 --> 49:48.280
My phone works too.

49:48.906 --> 49:51.158
No, it wouldn't have.

49:54.870 --> 49:59.416
You see,
your mother was a remarkable woman.

49:59.958 --> 50:02.294
She was very important to me,

50:04.087 --> 50:06.590
and I have been thinking
about the things that you said.

50:08.467 --> 50:10.427
I'm sorry. That was harsh.

50:11.345 --> 50:12.679
Yes, it was.

50:13.472 --> 50:15.807
But it got me thinking
about my own father.

50:17.684 --> 50:21.230
See, people let him down,

50:23.023 --> 50:25.317
people he thought he could count on.

50:25.317 --> 50:30.656
And they hurt him so bad that
he just gave up.

50:32.658 --> 50:35.202
And I was heading down the same path
and didn't even realize it

50:35.202 --> 50:37.162
until you walked through the door.

50:38.956 --> 50:45.254
So, are you saying that you've changed
your mind and decided to fund our project?

50:46.338 --> 50:47.756
No.

50:47.756 --> 50:51.343
Rule number one in business,
never invest your own money.

50:52.803 --> 50:54.763
Then whose money are we going to use?

50:55.389 --> 50:56.431
Helios's.

50:56.431 --> 50:59.977
We already went to Helios, Dev.
They turned us down.

50:59.977 --> 51:03.272
I got a feeling the new management team
will be more amenable to our proposal.

51:03.272 --> 51:05.482
What new management team?

51:07.067 --> 51:08.652
Us.

51:08.652 --> 51:12.406
Are you seriously suggesting that
we take over Helios?

51:12.406 --> 51:14.700
I still own a substantial amount of stock
in the company,

51:14.700 --> 51:16.869
and you inherited everything
from your mom.

51:16.869 --> 51:21.415
If we can convince enough stockholders
to throw in with us, well, we can do it.

51:22.583 --> 51:23.750
What do you say?

51:35.512 --> 51:37.014
Fuck it. Let's do it.

51:37.014 --> 51:38.348
All right, great.

51:38.348 --> 51:41.268
Now, stakeholders.

51:42.728 --> 51:47.065
I will approach these three here

51:47.065 --> 51:50.194
and, Kelly, I'd like you
to approach these others right here.

51:50.861 --> 51:52.237
I'll take this one.

51:53.363 --> 51:54.698
We go way back.

52:18.722 --> 52:19.973
<i>Yeah?</i>

52:20.682 --> 52:21.892
It's me.

52:23.101 --> 52:24.520
Aleida.

52:24.520 --> 52:26.104
I wasn't sure if you were--

52:42.454 --> 52:47.042
Wow. Looks like someone's been
on a buying spree.

52:48.418 --> 52:50.045
What brings you out my way?

52:53.841 --> 52:55.968
Got something for you to look at.

52:57.177 --> 52:58.512
Give me a minute.

53:06.144 --> 53:07.604
Oh, my God.

53:09.064 --> 53:12.693
You have Robby the Robot
from <i>Forbidden Planet.</i>

53:14.319 --> 53:17.406
You know,
it's Victor's all-time favorite movie.

53:18.323 --> 53:19.867
Hey, put that back!

53:20.409 --> 53:23.245
Right where you got it from. Right there.

53:25.914 --> 53:27.124
Come on.

53:35.507 --> 53:36.967
Sorry, it...

53:38.635 --> 53:41.722
It's just I know where everything is.
Don't wanna lose it.

53:44.975 --> 53:46.935
Show me the thing. Come on.

53:59.323 --> 54:00.782
I know about this.

54:00.782 --> 54:06.038
Yeah. It's a fascinating project,
but I thought Hobson killed it.

54:06.038 --> 54:08.749
We're doing this
through the private sector.

54:08.749 --> 54:09.833
We?

54:11.335 --> 54:12.878
Hold on, you're leaving NASA

54:14.755 --> 54:17.049
to work on this with Kelly Baldwin?

54:17.049 --> 54:18.800
And Dev Ayesa.

54:18.800 --> 54:20.677
Oh, Jesus.

54:21.386 --> 54:24.681
Look, I know it's crazy,
but Dev still owns a lot of Helios stock

54:25.682 --> 54:27.643
and so does Kelly.

54:27.643 --> 54:34.691
All we need is a few more stockholders
to join us, and we can retake his company.

54:35.192 --> 54:36.860
So that's why you're here.

54:38.028 --> 54:39.238
For my shares.

54:40.405 --> 54:44.284
It's an opportunity to do pure science
again without all the political bullshit--

54:44.284 --> 54:47.913
Spare me the sales pitch. Jesus.

54:47.913 --> 54:52.334
God. I'll sign the fucking thing
and then you can just go.

54:57.130 --> 54:58.257
Bill...

55:00.342 --> 55:03.136
I'm sorry I haven't been to see you
in so long.

55:04.304 --> 55:07.808
I don't blame you for being mad at me.
But I really--

55:07.808 --> 55:09.142
I'm not mad.

55:10.978 --> 55:12.187
You're not?

55:12.187 --> 55:13.438
No.

55:14.273 --> 55:15.440
I get it.

55:17.109 --> 55:19.486
Probably wouldn't want to see me either.

55:19.486 --> 55:23.240
But if you want my help you're gonna have
to explain something to me.

55:23.240 --> 55:24.241
What?

55:24.241 --> 55:27.202
Why you're walking away from NASA,
after 15 years,

55:27.202 --> 55:32.291
to work on a private robotics program
that, to be frank, is beneath you.

55:33.250 --> 55:35.210
You should be director by now.

55:35.711 --> 55:38.714
You can do this shit in your sleep.
You know it.

55:43.302 --> 55:45.304
I can't do manned space flight anymore.

55:46.180 --> 55:48.557
What? 'Cause of the <i>Ranger-1</i> accident?

55:52.519 --> 55:54.104
You've lost crew before.

55:55.898 --> 55:57.816
Guess everyone has their limit.

55:57.816 --> 56:02.529
But you always seemed more resilient.
I mean, you went back when--

56:02.529 --> 56:04.656
I didn't have a choice.

56:07.284 --> 56:10.495
- I owed it to all the people we lost.
- Margo, you mean?

56:10.495 --> 56:11.663
No.

56:11.663 --> 56:14.708
She lied to you. She betrayed her country
and still you owed it to her.

56:14.708 --> 56:18.212
Please, let's not have
this argument again. Okay?

56:18.212 --> 56:21.173
We don't know why she did it.
The Russians probably forced her.

56:21.173 --> 56:24.051
- So we are gonna have this argument again.
- Bill! Bill!

56:27.304 --> 56:31.308
The point I'm trying to make is
I am not more resilient than you.

56:41.735 --> 56:46.323
When I first walked into the new MOCR.

56:49.034 --> 56:51.078
Gleaming. Immaculate.

56:54.831 --> 56:59.336
I was just hit
with that stench of burning plastic.

57:00.295 --> 57:01.839
Hits the back of your throat.

57:04.842 --> 57:06.051
It burns.

57:07.386 --> 57:08.595
Yeah.

57:09.930 --> 57:13.058
But the smell faded and every morning
I'd wake up with this...

57:16.019 --> 57:17.563
feeling of dread.

57:19.815 --> 57:21.316
Then with the asteroid...

57:24.695 --> 57:26.446
it all came flooding back.

57:33.287 --> 57:35.414
I ran out of the fucking room, Bill.

57:38.041 --> 57:39.668
I left my post...

57:43.088 --> 57:45.340
and I couldn't go back in there anymore.

57:49.553 --> 57:51.305
At least you didn't pee your pants.

57:59.271 --> 58:00.439
That's for sure.

58:18.290 --> 58:19.958
Hey, why don't you come work with me?

58:21.418 --> 58:25.130
Feel like old times.
Get you out of the house, at least.

58:26.215 --> 58:28.133
Do whatever you want with my shares.

58:28.926 --> 58:30.052
I trust you...

58:32.513 --> 58:34.223
but I'm never coming back.

58:55.244 --> 58:56.453
Hello, Ms. Reynolds.

59:12.803 --> 59:16.682
Let me ask you again.
Who is the woman from the park?

59:18.183 --> 59:23.480
Like I said,
she never said who she works for.

59:24.606 --> 59:26.692
Yet you protect her. Why?

59:27.943 --> 59:29.278
Please,

59:30.445 --> 59:32.072
you need to believe me.

59:32.781 --> 59:34.908
I don't even know who she is.

59:37.077 --> 59:39.246
I'm in the middle of something.

01:00:30.088 --> 01:00:31.423
Goodbye.

01:00:31.423 --> 01:00:34.301
No. No. No.

01:00:34.301 --> 01:00:37.137
Wait. Help-- Call the American embassy.

01:00:37.804 --> 01:00:38.931
No, please.

01:01:25.811 --> 01:01:30.357
In summary, helium-3 refinery expansion
will continue Earth-side,

01:01:30.357 --> 01:01:32.401
as we escalate lunar mining.

01:01:32.401 --> 01:01:35.946
Relative to the capex number
we've shown you today of 29 billion.

01:01:35.946 --> 01:01:37.489
We remain committed.

01:01:37.489 --> 01:01:39.283
A question, Richard.

01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:48.625
Dev Ayesa, we're in the middle
of a board meeting here.

01:01:52.671 --> 01:01:54.047
The bylaws are clear.

01:01:54.047 --> 01:01:58.510
Control of this company requires me
to make a direct address to the board.

01:01:59.011 --> 01:02:00.554
Hello, board.

01:02:00.554 --> 01:02:04.391
I have put in a tender offer
backed by 23 other shareholders,

01:02:04.391 --> 01:02:05.976
giving us majority stake,

01:02:05.976 --> 01:02:10.397
naming me CEO
of this company effective immediately.

01:02:13.525 --> 01:02:17.237
Dev, I'm sorry, there are
all kinds of safeguards against that.

01:02:17.237 --> 01:02:21.366
And if you try and poison pill this
I'll just go ahead and swallow it.

01:02:21.366 --> 01:02:24.620
Any proxy fight
that just gets killed right in the crib.

01:02:25.329 --> 01:02:28.457
If you sue, I'll counter.

01:02:28.457 --> 01:02:31.960
If the SEC gets involved,
that will take months.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:35.255
By that point, the share value will crash,

01:02:35.255 --> 01:02:39.259
and this company's reputation
will be destroyed.

01:02:40.385 --> 01:02:42.471
So what are we going to do about it?

01:02:43.013 --> 01:02:45.682
The lesson of Icarus is not don't fly
too close to the sun.

01:02:45.682 --> 01:02:47.851
It's make better fucking wings.

01:02:48.352 --> 01:02:53.023
The best way to seize the future
is to invent it.

01:02:55.817 --> 01:02:57.069
So let's start.

01:02:57.069 --> 01:02:59.613
You are barred from this building,
effective immediately.

01:02:59.613 --> 01:03:03.617
Files, access and your e-mails have
been locked. Please, get out of my face.

01:03:07.329 --> 01:03:11.416
Arlene Spielman, Phillip Hillhouse,
Marla Bales,

01:03:12.626 --> 01:03:15.629
you didn't want to go to Mars
in the first place. Get out.

01:03:16.588 --> 01:03:17.923
I mean it. Get out.

01:03:18.674 --> 01:03:20.467
One foot in front of the other.

01:03:21.134 --> 01:03:24.179
I'm gutting the entire finance department.
Please, get out.

01:03:26.849 --> 01:03:28.267
Ivan Ochoa,

01:03:28.267 --> 01:03:32.187
the subsidies that you negotiated
for helium-3 are absolutely criminal.

01:03:32.187 --> 01:03:33.522
You get out as well.

01:03:33.522 --> 01:03:37.234
Zoe Howard. Sean Doorly. Get out.

01:03:40.529 --> 01:03:45.117
I do not know how you did it, Milosh,
but thank you.

01:03:45.617 --> 01:03:46.660
Pleasure.

01:03:48.245 --> 01:03:49.413
Cheers.

01:03:55.002 --> 01:04:00.382
And come back tomorrow.
I'll have more for you to do.

01:04:00.382 --> 01:04:04.344
I'm looking forward to it.
Though, there's one more thing.

01:04:05.596 --> 01:04:07.806
I might have found you
a new customer today.

01:04:10.058 --> 01:04:11.185
Really?

01:04:31.538 --> 01:04:34.041
Come in, my friend. Come on in.

01:04:34.875 --> 01:04:36.084
Come on.

01:04:37.294 --> 01:04:39.087
What can I do for you?

01:04:39.087 --> 01:04:43.509
Who would've thought? Nixon opened up
China, you opened up North Korea.

01:04:44.218 --> 01:04:46.011
Would you care for a drink?

01:04:46.678 --> 01:04:48.263
First one on the house.

01:04:49.097 --> 01:04:50.682
No drink.

01:04:54.811 --> 01:04:56.939
I can get you anything you need.

01:04:57.731 --> 01:05:01.735
Playboy magazine. Foot cream.
Even laser disc.

01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:09.493
I need you

01:05:10.202 --> 01:05:14.039
to bring me my wife.

01:06:09.261 --> 01:06:11.221
Please.

01:06:17.394 --> 01:06:20.189
Get that hood off of her.

01:06:36.246 --> 01:06:41.668
My apologies, Ms. Madison.
It took me some time to locate you.

01:06:44.087 --> 01:06:46.673
I-- I was--

01:06:48.509 --> 01:06:50.093
They wanted to know--

01:06:50.093 --> 01:06:53.514
It's okay. You're safe now.

01:06:56.683 --> 01:06:59.144
Come, follow me.

01:07:11.907 --> 01:07:13.116
Who are you?

01:07:14.701 --> 01:07:18.080
My name is Irina Vasilievna Morozova.

01:07:20.707 --> 01:07:22.376
And I want you to work for me.

01:07:24.253 --> 01:07:25.963
Work for you?

01:07:36.849 --> 01:07:38.350
Star City.

01:07:40.185 --> 01:07:43.689
Gorbachev and the army,
they have agreed to terms.

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.401
Korzhenko is the president.

01:07:47.985 --> 01:07:50.571
And I have been named
the new head of Roscosmos.

01:07:52.322 --> 01:07:56.785
I need skilled people on my side.
And you are very skilled, indeed.

01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:00.497
But you barely know me.

01:08:02.082 --> 01:08:04.251
I've known you for a long time, Margo.

01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:16.638
Are you coming?
