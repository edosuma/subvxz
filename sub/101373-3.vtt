You remember in the camp--

04:28.644 --> 04:34.108
you were so hungry
you'd cry all the time

04:34.149 --> 04:37.778
and I snuck into the storage
room to steal you rice?

04:39.863 --> 04:43.993
I took care of you.

04:45.411 --> 04:50.332
I still will.

04:54.420 --> 04:59.675
I also remember the time they
came after you for stealing.

04:59.717 --> 05:04.346
I said no, it was me,
and they broke my hands.

05:05.764 --> 05:07.725
You might be my big sister.

05:07.766 --> 05:11.437
But I protect you too.
We protect each other.

05:13.772 --> 05:14.940
You know...

05:14.982 --> 05:18.360
the Americans will torture me.

05:18.402 --> 05:21.488
I won't let them.

05:22.740 --> 05:24.116
How will you stop them?

05:27.995 --> 05:30.664
You have to let me go.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.586
I won't attack anyone.

05:35.627 --> 05:37.671
I won't hurt anyone.

05:40.424 --> 05:44.636
I'm your brother--

05:44.678 --> 05:47.848
we only have each other now.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.684
Please.

06:03.614 --> 06:07.868
I'm sorry.

48:43.087 --> 48:45.048
Please.

48:45.089 --> 48:46.090
Don't.

49:19.707 --> 49:22.627
Please.

49:22.669 --> 49:26.464
I love you.

49:28.466 --> 49:30.802
I love you, too.
