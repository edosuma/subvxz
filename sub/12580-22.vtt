WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:03.253


00:31.072 --> 00:33.491


00:35.410 --> 00:36.494
Uh...

00:37.829 --> 00:38.913
Uh...

00:42.167 --> 00:43.293
It's a boy!

00:43.376 --> 00:45.754
Look at him, tall as Mount Fuji

00:45.837 --> 00:47.756
with Michiko's sweet face.

00:47.839 --> 00:49.591
What's your name, boy? You speak English?

00:49.674 --> 00:51.593
My name is Junichiro.

00:51.676 --> 00:54.137
Juni... Juni... Junico? Juniper?

00:54.220 --> 00:55.055
Junichiro.

00:55.138 --> 00:56.264
Ah.

00:56.347 --> 00:58.767
So nice to meet you, Junch-jello.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.268
I'm your pappy.

01:01.186 --> 01:02.437
Aw, what the hell.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.105


01:04.189 --> 01:06.024
My mother has told me about you.

01:06.107 --> 01:08.610
Unfortunately, she is not here.

01:08.693 --> 01:11.654
She is viewing cherry blossoms in Nagoya.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.281
She will return tomorrow.

01:13.364 --> 01:15.658
Then tomorrow it is. Dinner's on me.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.410
There's a swanky restaurant in our hotel.

01:17.494 --> 01:20.163
Sixty bucks for a burger,
but what the heck,

01:20.246 --> 01:21.623
for all I know, it's your birthday.

01:33.843 --> 01:36.137
-How could you not know
you had another son?

01:36.221 --> 01:37.931
How many women have you slept with?

01:38.014 --> 01:41.267
-Five? Six?
-Two hundred seventy-three.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.394
But this ain't about sex, no, sir.

01:43.478 --> 01:44.729
It's about love.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.147
And sex.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.066
<i>Well, I spent the year after the war</i>

01:48.149 --> 01:50.110
<i>in the U.S. Army Hospital in Tokyo.</i>

01:50.193 --> 01:54.280
<i>General MacArthur's personal sawbones
had reattached my feets to my knees</i>

01:54.364 --> 01:57.951
<i>and prescribed enough antibiotics
to cure the French army's clap.</i>

01:58.034 --> 02:00.286
<i>Every day, a Japanese angel</i>

02:00.370 --> 02:04.999
<i>would drain my shins of puss</i>
<i>and fill my heart with love.</i>

02:05.083 --> 02:06.376
<i>It was magical.</i>

02:08.294 --> 02:09.671
<i>Then excruciating.</i>

02:09.754 --> 02:12.006
<i>Which made it all the more magical.</i>

02:12.090 --> 02:15.510
<i>I was under strict orders not
to fraternize with the conquered women.</i>

02:15.593 --> 02:17.554
<i>So we hid our love.</i>

02:20.682 --> 02:23.059
<i>During wartime,</i>
<i>you don't think about the future.</i>

02:23.143 --> 02:25.311
<i>But it comes anyway.</i>

02:27.730 --> 02:29.232
<i>I was being shipped out.</i>

02:30.900 --> 02:32.610
<i>I did what I could to stay</i>

02:33.278 --> 02:34.445
<i>but it wasn't enough.</i>

02:38.950 --> 02:42.412
No! No.

02:42.495 --> 02:45.081
I left more than my shins in Japan.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.916
I left a little piece of my heart.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.878
And some seed, I guess,
that grew into Junch-jello.

02:52.046 --> 02:54.257
A brother? Wow.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.301
I have a brother.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.261
A Japanese half-brother.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.430
That is some freaky stuff.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.015
The Hill brothers.

03:03.141 --> 03:05.935
Watch out for those Hill brothers.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.523
Did you see what those Hill brothers
were up to the other day?

03:10.607 --> 03:12.525
Just be prepared
for when your new half-brother

03:12.609 --> 03:13.902
decides he's in love with me.

03:13.985 --> 03:15.653
I must be quite a sight to him

03:15.737 --> 03:17.822
with my exotic, unbound feet.

03:17.906 --> 03:20.158
Well, I'm too excited to sleep.

Hello, Luanne.

04:20.426 --> 04:24.013
Yeah, okay, this call is costing
over ten dollars a minute,

04:24.097 --> 04:25.431
so put Ladybird on the line.

04:25.515 --> 04:28.393
Ladybird? Ladybird?

04:28.476 --> 04:29.811
Come here, girl.

04:29.894 --> 04:32.230
Ladybird, it's Daddy.

04:32.313 --> 04:35.566
Listen to this, I have a big brother.
Isn't that exciting?

04:35.650 --> 04:37.235
I wish you were here to meet him.

04:37.318 --> 04:39.570
Oh, I miss you so much.

04:39.654 --> 04:42.448
<i>I got to go. I love you.</i>

04:42.532 --> 04:43.574
Ew.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.744
Does this bow tie
make me look like a puppet?

04:46.828 --> 04:49.455
Love doesn't care
what you look like, Grandpa,

04:49.539 --> 04:52.000
or if you can even speak
the same language.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.251
You meet someone?

04:54.210 --> 04:56.129
Well! Good for you!

04:56.212 --> 04:59.048
Try to get a foot massage.
They got a knack.

05:06.055 --> 05:07.640
Hello, Michiko.

05:07.724 --> 05:08.808
Hello, Cotton.

05:09.434 --> 05:13.604
I am glad to see
your feet did not fall off as predicted.

05:13.688 --> 05:15.440
How is everything else?

05:15.523 --> 05:18.985
Well, it's been a crazy fitty years.

05:19.068 --> 05:22.947
After I got back to America,
I had a nice, juicy porterhouse

05:23.031 --> 05:25.033
cooked medium-rare,
just the way I likes 'em.

05:25.116 --> 05:26.951
Then I knocked around a bit.

05:27.035 --> 05:29.370
Eventually I got tired
of working for jackasses

05:29.454 --> 05:31.122
and decided to make an honest living

05:31.205 --> 05:33.666
installing asbestos
into schools and hospitals.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.627
Got married twice, one ugly, one hot...

05:36.711 --> 05:40.923
and had two sons, Hank
and my baby, Good Hank.

05:41.007 --> 05:44.344
Tell me, Ko-Ko,
how have the years treated you?

05:44.427 --> 05:46.095
Thank you for asking.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.640
I worked as a washerwoman
to support my son...

05:49.724 --> 05:52.143
Uh, your son, Junichiro.

05:53.561 --> 05:56.647
After war, I ate rice hulls,

05:56.731 --> 06:01.944
and for ten years,
I raised a child out of wedlock, alone.

06:02.028 --> 06:06.991
This arrangement afforded me
many opportunities for difficulty.

06:07.075 --> 06:10.912
Then I found a man
who would marry such a woman...

06:10.995 --> 06:12.205
my Wataru.

06:14.832 --> 06:19.670
So, uh I work in propane
and propane accessories.

06:19.754 --> 06:22.965
You may have seen it used
in some of our movies.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.967
What kind of work do you do?

06:25.051 --> 06:26.219
Robots.

06:26.302 --> 06:28.971
Robots, huh? Hm.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.598
Robots.

06:30.681 --> 06:32.392
This is very beautiful.

06:32.475 --> 06:35.144
But as you say in Hollywood,
we have a "capper."

06:35.228 --> 06:36.646
Tomorrow you travel to Kyoto

06:36.729 --> 06:41.025
to attend U.S.-Japanese peace ceremony
hosted by Emperor of Japan.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.194
Got berk! What an honor.

06:43.277 --> 06:46.864
To come back and find family
waiting for me, too?

06:46.948 --> 06:51.494
I... I don't usually cry unless someone's
pulling out my fingernails

06:51.577 --> 06:54.914
like you fine folks did so many years ago.

06:54.997 --> 06:59.961
I came here to apologize to Michiko
but discovered I wronged two people.

07:00.044 --> 07:04.298
I'd give what's left of my legs
to hear you both say you forgive me.

07:05.591 --> 07:08.803
I am sorry.
What you did is unforgivable.

07:08.886 --> 07:11.347
To come here after 50 years,

07:11.431 --> 07:14.350
and think you can buy me
hamburger and be my father?

07:14.434 --> 07:17.353
No. I humbly wish my mother
had never met you.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.147
Ooh-wee, Junty Joe!

07:19.230 --> 07:20.898
You gots a bit of the Hill temper in you.

07:20.982 --> 07:23.526
My name is not Junty Joe.

07:23.609 --> 07:25.278
It is Junichiro.

07:25.361 --> 07:26.904
And you are not my father.

07:28.072 --> 07:29.615
I am not a Hill.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.242
It is a shameful name.

07:31.325 --> 07:34.078
I formally renounce
the Hill blood that is in me.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.621
You take that back, boy,

07:35.705 --> 07:37.999
or I'll take back my apology.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.375
I will not take it back.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.253
I come here to make peace
and you kamikaze me?

07:42.336 --> 07:46.299
That's it! I re-declare war on Japan!

07:46.382 --> 07:47.341
Hyaaah...

07:47.425 --> 07:48.509
Wait, Dad. No.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.723
I'm sorry, he's probably not used
to drinking so much tea.

07:53.806 --> 07:57.018
With all respect and honor,
I would not be saddened

07:57.101 --> 07:59.270
if both you and your father went to hell.

08:09.780 --> 08:13.284
Junichiro our dad's missing.
He never came back last night.

08:13.367 --> 08:15.244
My dad not missing.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.164
Wataru is fishing for mackerel
as he does every morning.

08:18.247 --> 08:19.999
Please, you've got to help me.

08:20.082 --> 08:21.459
He's on a rampage.

08:21.542 --> 08:25.588
He already desecrated a koi pond
and turned over a noodle cart,

08:25.671 --> 08:27.798
and that was before
he even left the hotel.

08:27.882 --> 08:30.009
I cannot leave in the middle of the day.

08:30.092 --> 08:31.677
I am assistant manager,

08:31.761 --> 08:33.679
one of only 30.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.723
Dang it, he's gone berserk,

08:35.806 --> 08:37.391
and when he winds up on the news,

08:37.475 --> 08:40.394
everybody's going to find out
he's your dad,

08:40.478 --> 08:44.065
and that's going to bring you great shame,
I tell you what.

08:49.403 --> 08:51.531
Got berk!

08:51.614 --> 08:54.867
The whole lousy country's
made of paper and balsa wood.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.661
Got to find me a book of matches.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.375
Okay, big day, big day.

09:02.458 --> 09:04.585
We're going to see everything
Tokyo has to offer,

09:04.669 --> 09:07.588
the tofu museum, Chinatown...

09:11.384 --> 09:12.593
Unless you want to rig up

09:12.677 --> 09:15.179
some kind of tummy pack to haul me around,

09:15.263 --> 09:17.306
I'm heading back to the room for a nap.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.183
Hmm. Okay.

09:19.267 --> 09:22.144
Be sure to fill the ice bucket,
so we'll have water in the morning.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.319
Dance!

09:43.124 --> 09:45.459
Hey, friend, a little help?

09:46.210 --> 09:48.671
Hey, there, uh... in the yellow shirt.

09:50.631 --> 09:53.342
Excuse me, Doctor? What the...

09:53.426 --> 09:56.262
What is wrong with these people?
Why won't they talk to me?

09:56.345 --> 09:58.848
What do you expect running around
like crazy cowboy?

09:58.931 --> 10:03.978
This not Texas, shoot off guns
pow-pow-pow Rambo John Wayne.

10:04.061 --> 10:07.356
In Japan, you do not raise voice
and speak to people

10:07.440 --> 10:09.609
without proper introduction.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.292
<i>♪ Do, doodleucup ♪</i>

10:26.375 --> 10:27.918
<i>♪ Ding, do, do ♪</i>

10:28.002 --> 10:29.545
Hey.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.921
What's the head Magoo saying?

10:31.005 --> 10:34.300
Emperor in Kyoto to exchange apologies
with GI Joes.

10:34.383 --> 10:38.012
I'd sooner spit in his face
than apologize...

10:38.095 --> 10:40.056
Hmm, don't mind if I do.

10:44.518 --> 10:46.395
<i>♪ Do, doodleucup ♪</i>

10:55.821 --> 10:57.865
-Dance?
-I can't.

10:57.948 --> 11:00.534
I got to be in the room
before my mom gets back.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.293
Okay, four pictures.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.212
We're going to tell a story.

11:11.295 --> 11:13.214
I'm an American boy band star

11:13.297 --> 11:14.548
and...

11:14.632 --> 11:17.635
Forget the story,
let's just do four of those.

11:17.718 --> 11:19.220
Dang it, I got to go.

11:19.303 --> 11:22.973
Meet me here tonight at 6:30,
and we can pick up where we left off.

11:23.057 --> 11:25.518
-Dance.
-I can't.

11:25.601 --> 11:27.353
Oh, you mean tonight.

11:27.436 --> 11:29.146
Yeah.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.994
Ah, I could drink a beer
that size right about now.

11:52.753 --> 11:55.798
So, uh, how long you been
in the robot game?

11:55.881 --> 11:59.135
There was not a time
that I was not fascinated by robots.

11:59.218 --> 12:02.513
Robots are clean, efficient, reliable...

12:02.596 --> 12:04.849
Heh, that sounds like propane.

12:04.932 --> 12:08.102
I wonder if they ever made
a robot that runs on propane?

12:08.185 --> 12:09.145
No.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.898
But they could.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.278
-Yep.
-<i>Hai.</i>

12:17.361 --> 12:20.531
You know, you're a successful guy,
an assistant manager.

12:20.614 --> 12:21.824
How come you never got married?

12:21.907 --> 12:24.034
Who would have me?

12:24.118 --> 12:27.747
I cannot provide sons or even daughters.

12:28.456 --> 12:30.499
Do you have a narrow urethra?

12:30.583 --> 12:31.709
<i>Hai.</i>

12:32.460 --> 12:36.255
I'm also, uh... limited in that way.

12:36.338 --> 12:39.258
There's, uh, some stretches
you could do to, um...

12:39.341 --> 12:42.553
you know, uh, get things moving.

12:42.636 --> 12:44.388
I'll send them to you in the mail.

12:47.600 --> 12:51.771
Oh, it is one of the businessmen
I exchanged cards with.

12:51.854 --> 12:55.649
See, Japanese politeness
is surprisingly effective.

12:57.276 --> 13:00.863
Oh! He just saw shinless foreigner
at train station

13:00.946 --> 13:04.366
buy ticket and dishonor pay toilet.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.618
We must go.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.454
I'm going to tell Uncle Hank

13:08.537 --> 13:10.873
I learned how to clone
at the junior college.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.750
You two better back me up.

13:13.751 --> 13:16.962
Ladybirds, your house is being robbed.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.886
Has he seen him?

13:23.969 --> 13:26.472
He says a question unrelated to tickets

13:26.555 --> 13:28.641
should be answered by information host.

13:28.724 --> 13:30.309
He is not information host.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.111
-Ah.
-What's he saying?

13:41.195 --> 13:42.947
He say ask ticket vendor.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.865
What the... You already did that.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.075
He sent you to the other guy.

13:46.158 --> 13:49.453
Japan can sometimes be
tiresome in this way.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.705
But you're only half Japanese.

13:51.789 --> 13:56.293
Look, in America when the traditional
way isn't working we improvise.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.254
I'd suggest telling this gentleman

13:58.337 --> 14:01.340
to give you the information
or you'll kick his ass.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.646
Out of the way. Damn it!

14:15.729 --> 14:16.564
There he is.

14:24.488 --> 14:26.448
Dang it, Junichiro, come on!

14:29.535 --> 14:30.619
Dad, wait!

14:30.703 --> 14:34.290
I can't, boy. I gots a date in Kyoto
with the Emperor.

14:34.373 --> 14:35.583
Oh, thank God.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.209
You're just going to the Peace Ceremony.

14:37.293 --> 14:40.296
Yep. I'm going to hawk
a loogie in the face

14:40.379 --> 14:42.715
of this country's number one sum bitch.

14:42.798 --> 14:44.508
What? Dad, no...

14:50.556 --> 14:52.099
You will be proud of me.

14:52.182 --> 14:55.019
I was abrupt with an elderly woman.

14:55.102 --> 14:57.062
We're too late.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.982
Our dad's on his way
to spit in the Emperor's face.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.281
Who will want to buy robots

15:07.364 --> 15:09.909
from a man whose father spit
on the Emperor?

15:09.992 --> 15:11.118
Don't worry.

15:11.201 --> 15:13.913
The Hill Brothers are on the case, right?

15:13.996 --> 15:15.039
<i>Hai.</i>

15:16.290 --> 15:18.417
Can't this thing go any faster than...

15:19.543 --> 15:20.920
Wow.

15:29.136 --> 15:30.262
Ah!

15:37.561 --> 15:38.979
Open up. Police!

15:39.063 --> 15:42.942
Uh, uh, this is Hank Hill, occupant,

15:43.025 --> 15:49.365
and I cannot open the door
as I am making love to my wife, Peggy.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.075
We're doing it.

15:59.625 --> 16:02.711
Oh, my God! Boomhauer! Boomhauer, please!

16:02.795 --> 16:05.464
Would you take in Hank's paper?

16:05.547 --> 16:06.548
Yo.

16:09.009 --> 16:12.388
Step aside. Don't make me waste
my lungbutter on you.

16:16.016 --> 16:19.186
Uh, why don't you go on without me.

16:19.269 --> 16:21.814
I saw a nice kimono
in the gift shop window

16:21.897 --> 16:24.024
that'd be perfect for Joseph.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.318
Uh-uh. You're not going anywhere, mister.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.654
Correction. You are going somewhere,

16:28.737 --> 16:32.324
everywhere,
with Peggy Hill's Touriffic Tokyo.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.243
First stop, the Disney Store.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.497
<i>♪ Everybody superhappy! ♪</i>

16:38.580 --> 16:40.165
<i>♪ Everybody superhappy! ♪</i>

16:40.249 --> 16:41.792
<i>6:30 P.M.!</i>

16:42.459 --> 16:43.752
Dance?

16:43.836 --> 16:46.422
Dance.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.558
Oh, Mr. Cotton Hill, Mr. Lead Story!

16:57.641 --> 16:59.059
Just in time.

16:59.143 --> 17:01.812
This badge admits you
to peace ceremony with Emperor.

17:01.895 --> 17:04.815
And if you start to cry,
try to look at red light.

17:04.898 --> 17:07.317
Ah, there's going to be
plenty of waterworks.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.577
Let me through.

17:16.660 --> 17:19.371
Emergency! Come on, move aside.

17:32.843 --> 17:34.178
I kick your ass!

17:37.973 --> 17:38.974
Look at me!

17:39.058 --> 17:41.518
Here come Ronald Reagan, Mike Tyson!

17:48.192 --> 17:50.569
So, Colonel Mr. Cotton Hill,

17:50.652 --> 17:53.363
how does it feel to be making peace
with sworn enemy?

17:57.409 --> 18:00.204
Goddang it! We're never going to stop Dad.

18:02.039 --> 18:04.541
...Tom Brokaw.

18:08.462 --> 18:11.673
-What did you say?
-I tell him you are Tom Brokaw.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.385
You crazy bastard.

18:20.891 --> 18:22.935
Dad, no!

18:23.018 --> 18:24.978
He's got security everywhere.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.523
How many body parts
do you want to leave in this country?

18:29.608 --> 18:31.110
Father, no!

18:31.693 --> 18:33.195
What did you just call me?

18:33.278 --> 18:35.197
I called you "Father."

18:35.280 --> 18:37.866
There is no shame in being a Hill.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.409
Hank taught me that.

18:39.493 --> 18:43.122
And he also taught me there's no shame
in having a narrow urethra.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.958
Uh, that was just between brothers.

18:46.041 --> 18:49.753
Ah, like Japan, I am no longer your enemy.

18:50.712 --> 18:52.506
And like my little brother,

18:52.589 --> 18:54.675
I am your son, I tell you what.

19:11.024 --> 19:14.153
King Tojo, even though you took my shins,

19:14.236 --> 19:16.071
and I took fitty of your boys,

19:16.155 --> 19:17.197
no hard feelings.

19:18.574 --> 19:21.368
Now that we're all lovey-dovey,
I'd like you to meet my sons,

19:21.451 --> 19:23.579
Hank and Junichiro.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.922
What better souvenir
than a Tokyo phone book?

19:34.006 --> 19:35.257
Here, Bobby...

19:35.340 --> 19:36.508
Carry that.

19:36.592 --> 19:39.261
I ain't one for <i>sayonaras,</i> but...

19:39.344 --> 19:40.846
I've been meaning to, uh...

19:41.722 --> 19:42.931
give you this.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.850
Maybe you don't want it. I...

19:49.313 --> 19:50.439
Thank you.

19:51.523 --> 19:54.484
Now I have something to remember you by.

19:55.777 --> 19:57.446
This photo.

19:58.155 --> 20:00.199
Oh, and our son.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.201
So, I'm forgiven?

20:02.284 --> 20:03.952
Yes.

20:05.954 --> 20:07.456
Good-bye, Cotton.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.877
Allow me to help, sister-in-law.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.171
We would have invited you in
for farewell tea,

20:14.254 --> 20:16.089
but as you will read in my article,

20:16.173 --> 20:18.884
these Japanese hotel rooms
are horribly cramped.

20:20.969 --> 20:24.389
Surely, you did not spend
entire vacation in sitting room?

20:24.473 --> 20:25.724
Huh?

20:29.978 --> 20:31.939
Oh, my Lord.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.861


20:44.493 --> 20:46.828
You're gonna miss your war-skooch,
ain't you, boy?

20:46.912 --> 20:49.206
I never even got to say good-bye.

20:49.289 --> 20:50.999
What? Stop the cab!

20:51.083 --> 20:52.501
Stop the cab!

20:53.502 --> 20:54.670
Dad, what are you doing?

20:54.753 --> 20:56.630
You wouldn't understand, boy.

20:56.713 --> 20:58.340
It's about love.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.592
Bobby, you gots to say your good-byes

21:00.676 --> 21:03.095
'cause Lord knows
it's a grenade in the keister

21:03.178 --> 21:05.180
to come back for 'em after 50 years.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.848
Now go, boy!

21:08.350 --> 21:10.936

21:11.019 --> 21:13.355

Let's not spoil the moment
with a lot of talk.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.073
