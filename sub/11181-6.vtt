Fish don't fryin the kitchen

00:29.512 --> 00:32.342
Beans don't burnon the grill

00:32.342 --> 00:34.896
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:34.896 --> 00:37.658
Just to get up that hill

00:37.658 --> 00:40.178
Now we're upin

00:40.178 --> 00:42.732
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:42.732 --> 00:45.286

01:14.867 --> 01:17.801
Mr. Jefferson?

01:17.801 --> 01:20.252
Mr. Jefferson?
What do you want?

01:20.252 --> 01:22.496
Can I have part of
that paper?
Sure.

01:23.497 --> 01:25.085
Here.

01:27.052 --> 01:29.744
Now quit bothering me.

01:29.744 --> 01:31.746
You know, it's amazing how
some people can be

01:31.746 --> 01:33.472
so funny so early
in the morning.

01:34.818 --> 01:36.544
It's too bad
you ain't one of them.

01:38.339 --> 01:39.858
Why ain't you
working, Florence?

01:39.858 --> 01:42.274
'Cause I can't do nothing
till I read Dear Abby.

01:42.274 --> 01:44.380
Oh, did you
write a letter about
your broken romance?

01:44.380 --> 01:45.864
What broken romance?

01:45.864 --> 01:47.831
Between you and work. Ha!
There. Here it is!

01:49.454 --> 01:51.041
You know, Mr. Jefferson,

01:51.041 --> 01:54.942
in all of God's creation,
the good Lord only made
one mistake.

01:54.942 --> 01:57.531
Which one was that?
I'm working for it.

02:00.085 --> 02:03.157
George, I need some help.

02:03.157 --> 02:05.815
I've been telling you that
for years, Weezy, but you
insist on keeping Florence.

02:07.748 --> 02:10.268
George, would you hook the
back of my dress for me?

02:10.268 --> 02:11.786
Oh, sure.

02:11.786 --> 02:13.616
But you know I'm better
at unhooking it.

02:16.377 --> 02:20.726
Before I met you, Weezy,
the girls used to call me
"Fingers" Jefferson.

02:20.726 --> 02:23.004
Well, that's funny.
Ever since I've known you,

02:23.004 --> 02:24.765
you've been all thumbs.

02:26.215 --> 02:27.699
Why are you
all dressed up?

02:27.699 --> 02:29.839
Mrs. Blanchard
is coming over.

02:29.839 --> 02:30.978
Now, hurry and
finish your coffee.

02:30.978 --> 02:33.118
I wanna clear off the
dishes before she gets here.

02:33.118 --> 02:34.844
Why?
Would she steal them?

02:36.328 --> 02:38.434
Who's
Mrs. Blanchard?

02:38.434 --> 02:41.161
She's the director of
the Neighborhood Help Center.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.266
Oh. Why is she
coming here?

02:43.266 --> 02:44.750
Well, I'm not sure.

02:44.750 --> 02:46.580
But I think she's
gonna ask me

02:46.580 --> 02:48.892
to be the editor of
the Center's newsletter.

02:48.892 --> 02:51.688
Oh.
Well, don't
just say 'Oh'.

02:51.688 --> 02:54.035
I'd love to be the editor
of that newsletter.

02:54.035 --> 02:55.313
Get excited!

02:55.313 --> 02:58.143
All right. Oh! Oh! Oh!

02:58.143 --> 02:59.903
I'm so excited.
George!

02:59.903 --> 03:02.527
Uh! Satisfied?

03:02.527 --> 03:04.425
Well, that's
a little better.

03:04.425 --> 03:06.531
What makes you think
you're gonna get the job?

03:06.531 --> 03:10.569
Well, a week ago,
Mrs. Blanchard dropped
a hint about it.

03:10.569 --> 03:12.157
Then yesterday
she called me

03:12.157 --> 03:14.159
and said she wanted to
stop over and see me.

03:14.159 --> 03:17.197
Hmm... I hope she don't
bring none of those
crazy dope fiends with her.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.993
George, the Center does more
than work with drug addicts.

03:20.993 --> 03:23.513
We handle
consumer complaints.

03:23.513 --> 03:25.550
We provide
pregnancy counseling.

03:25.550 --> 03:26.827
We...
Pregnancy counseling?

03:26.827 --> 03:28.069
You mean to tell me
there are still people

03:28.069 --> 03:29.243
who don't know
how to get pregnant?

03:29.243 --> 03:31.314
Oh, George.

03:31.314 --> 03:33.868
When I was a kid you
didn't have to go to no fancy
center for that.

03:33.868 --> 03:38.045
All you had to do
was stand on the street
and ask anybody over 12.

03:38.045 --> 03:39.840
They could have asked
me when I was 11.

03:40.875 --> 03:43.533
Oh, you're impossible.

03:43.533 --> 03:46.260
Can't you see I'm doing
something useful?

03:46.260 --> 03:49.539
You were doing something
useful when you went to
nursing school last year.

03:49.539 --> 03:51.369
George, we've been
through this before.

03:51.369 --> 03:53.992
I wasn't cut out
to be a nurse.

03:53.992 --> 03:56.374
What are you talking
about, Weezy? You looked
great in that uniform.

03:56.374 --> 03:57.754
Even though it was white.

04:01.206 --> 04:04.589
There's more to
being a nurse than
wearing a uniform.

04:04.589 --> 04:06.591
What are you talking
about? All you gotta know

04:06.591 --> 04:08.662
is how to make beds,
when to pass out pills,

04:08.662 --> 04:10.422
and which end to stick
the thermometer in.

04:12.873 --> 04:16.221
George, when I fainted
in the emergency room,

04:16.221 --> 04:18.396
and the patient's mother
had to help me out,

04:18.396 --> 04:21.122
I knew then I'd never
make a good nurse.

04:21.122 --> 04:23.849
The patient's mother?
I thought you said
the doctor carried you out.

04:23.849 --> 04:26.404
No, he was the one
who chased me out.

04:28.578 --> 04:31.650
Well, look, Weezy,
at least if you was a nurse
you'd be getting paid for it.

04:31.650 --> 04:33.756
George, I love working
for the Center,

04:33.756 --> 04:35.861
and I don't wanna
get paid for it.

04:35.861 --> 04:36.966
Oh, that's great.

04:36.966 --> 04:38.519
I got a wife that works
and don't wanna get paid.

04:38.519 --> 04:40.280
And a maid who gets
paid and don't wanna work.

04:43.904 --> 04:46.493
George, when you've been
as fortunate as we have,

04:46.493 --> 04:49.910
it's only right that
you spend some time
helping others.

04:49.910 --> 04:51.498
Yeah, if you wanna
help others, can't you

04:51.498 --> 04:54.017
pick a more respectable
class of people to work with?

04:54.017 --> 04:57.711
Okay. As soon as one
of the Rockefellers need help,

04:57.711 --> 04:59.747
I'll be there.

04:59.747 --> 05:01.508
Oh, Weezy,
you know what I mean.

05:01.508 --> 05:05.650
George, the Help Center is
a respectable charity.

05:05.650 --> 05:10.275
And Mrs. Blanchard is one
of the most respected women
in town.

05:10.275 --> 05:13.658
Blanchard...
Hey, wait a minute.

05:13.658 --> 05:14.831
Who is this Mrs. Blanchard
married to?

05:16.005 --> 05:17.420
Mr. Blanchard.
Yeah...

05:19.284 --> 05:21.873
Is this Blanchard
of Blanchard, Jones
and Wentworth,

05:21.873 --> 05:23.357
the brokerage firm?

05:23.357 --> 05:25.117
I'm not sure what
her husband does.

05:25.117 --> 05:26.981
Well, are they rich?
No.

05:26.981 --> 05:28.673
Oh.
They are loaded.

05:28.673 --> 05:30.916
Well then it
must be him! Florence!

05:30.916 --> 05:33.263
Come on, Weezy, get this
place cleaned up quick!

05:33.263 --> 05:36.059
Blanchard, Jones and
Wentworth are one of the best
firms on Wall Street.

05:36.059 --> 05:38.924
I gotta be first in line
if I wanna get the hot tips.

05:38.924 --> 05:41.755
The last hot tip you got
nearly cooked your goose.

05:43.239 --> 05:44.551
Did you call me,
Mr. Jefferson?

05:44.551 --> 05:46.553
Yeah. Get this place
cleaned up quick!

05:46.553 --> 05:47.726
Why?
What's the big hurry?

05:47.726 --> 05:49.728
Mr. Blanchard's wife
is coming over here.

05:49.728 --> 05:53.491
Who?
She's the director of the
Neighborhood Help Center.

05:53.491 --> 05:54.802
Oh. Is she coming
to help me?

05:58.288 --> 05:59.704
No, no, dummy!

05:59.704 --> 06:01.706
That's the place Weezy
works to help

06:01.706 --> 06:05.434
those poor, misguided
souls who ain't got
no place to turn to.

06:05.434 --> 06:07.470
"Poor, misguided souls"?

06:07.470 --> 06:09.955
A minute ago they were
crazy dope fiends.

06:09.955 --> 06:12.164
See what a great
job you're doing, Weezy?

06:14.028 --> 06:17.135
George, you're not
gonna turn this into
a business meeting.

06:17.135 --> 06:19.344
Mrs. Blanchard is coming
here to see me.

06:19.344 --> 06:21.726
I know that.
So this is what you do.

06:21.726 --> 06:23.693
You just ask her
how her husband is,

06:23.693 --> 06:25.385
then you get her
to invite us to dinner.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.663
George, that
would be wrong.

06:27.663 --> 06:29.285
Yeah, you're right.

06:29.285 --> 06:31.045
Then we'll invite
them to dinner.

06:32.978 --> 06:35.118
George, if you thought you
could make money out of it,

06:35.118 --> 06:36.637
you would invite
the devil to dinner.

06:36.637 --> 06:39.122
Why not?
We got air conditioning.

06:41.642 --> 06:44.852
Yeah, see you later, Weezy.
Good luck with Mrs. Blanchard.

06:44.852 --> 06:46.923
Hey, Georgie, man.

06:46.923 --> 06:48.718
What do
you say, man?

06:48.718 --> 06:51.687
I say what the hell
you talking like that for?

06:51.687 --> 06:53.896
I'm practicing
my accent, man.

06:53.896 --> 06:56.623
My relatives from
the West Indies coming for
a little visit, you know.

06:56.623 --> 06:59.073
Oh, yeah? Well,
be sure to let me know
when they're here.

06:59.073 --> 07:00.350
You wanna
meet them, George?

07:00.350 --> 07:01.800
No, I wanna
make other plans.

07:04.113 --> 07:07.288
Helen, I didn't know
you had relatives in
the West Indies.

07:07.288 --> 07:09.187
Oh yes, my dear.

07:09.187 --> 07:10.430
My aunt Rebecca,

07:10.430 --> 07:13.433
my cousin Esau,
and my cousin Solomon.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.090
Oh, I love those
biblical names.

07:16.090 --> 07:18.852
You know, I spent
a lot of time with
a West Indian family.

07:18.852 --> 07:20.474
You did? From what island?

07:20.474 --> 07:22.338
Long Island.
I was their maid.

07:24.202 --> 07:26.791
ell,justcamebytoseeifyouwannago

07:26.791 --> 07:29.345
with me to the market
to buy some conch.

07:29.345 --> 07:31.796
Conch? That's shellfish,
isn't it?

07:31.796 --> 07:33.073
Yes, my dear.

07:33.073 --> 07:36.317
And I'm gonna buy some
pigeon peas, rice,

07:36.317 --> 07:38.250
mangos, yams.

07:38.250 --> 07:41.426
Oh, girl, we're gonna
make bacchanal.

07:41.426 --> 07:43.877
You do know what
bacchanal is, don't you?

07:43.877 --> 07:47.467
Bacchanal... Isn't that
near the Panama Canal?

07:50.400 --> 07:52.472
No. Bacchanal means...

07:52.472 --> 07:54.853
Big party, right?
Right, girl.

07:54.853 --> 07:56.406
Heh, heh, man.

07:56.406 --> 07:57.891
We're gonna
be eating, yes

07:57.891 --> 07:59.444
And dancing, yes

07:59.444 --> 08:00.756
Back to back...

08:00.756 --> 08:02.033
BOTH:
...belly to belly.

08:02.033 --> 08:03.344
I don't give a damn

08:03.344 --> 08:04.794
I done dead already

08:04.794 --> 08:05.761
Back to back

08:05.761 --> 08:06.934
Belly to belly

08:06.934 --> 08:08.211
A jumping jamboree

08:08.211 --> 08:09.696
Hey, hey, hey!

08:09.696 --> 08:10.593
Back to back
Yes!

08:10.593 --> 08:12.043
Belly to belly!

08:12.043 --> 08:14.045
I don't give a damn
I done dead already

08:14.045 --> 08:15.115
Back to back

08:15.115 --> 08:16.254
Belly to belly

08:16.254 --> 08:17.289
A jumping jamboree

08:18.187 --> 08:19.499
Get down!

08:21.052 --> 08:22.432
Oh, it was y'all.

08:22.432 --> 08:24.158
For a minute I thought
y'all was the Pointer Sisters.

08:27.783 --> 08:29.888
I made you some fresh
coffee for you and your company.

08:29.888 --> 08:31.338
Oh, thanks, Florence.

08:31.338 --> 08:32.788
Oh, you expecting company?

08:32.788 --> 08:34.721
Yes. Mrs. Blanchard
is coming over.

08:34.721 --> 08:36.757
She's the director of the
Neighborhood Help Center.

08:36.757 --> 08:38.897
Well, I better go
shopping by myself.

08:38.897 --> 08:40.658
Oh, why don't you stay?

08:40.658 --> 08:42.522
Mrs. Blanchard
won't be here long.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.627
And we can go shopping
after she leaves.

08:44.627 --> 08:46.042
Well, if you're
sure it's okay.

08:46.042 --> 08:47.112
Oh, sure.

08:47.112 --> 08:48.907
And you'd enjoy
meeting her.

08:48.907 --> 08:50.840
She's an amazing woman.

08:50.840 --> 08:53.740
When she wants something
done, it gets done.

08:55.086 --> 08:56.812
Oh, that must be her now.

08:59.469 --> 09:02.127
Hi, Louise.
Oh, hi, Fay. Come in.

09:02.127 --> 09:03.508
Sorry I'm late.

09:03.508 --> 09:05.406
Oh, you're not late.
Yes, I am.

09:05.406 --> 09:07.167
I said I'd be
here at 10:00.

09:07.167 --> 09:08.651
It's three minutes past.

09:08.651 --> 09:10.584
Oh, well,
what's three minutes?

09:11.758 --> 09:14.588
Louise, do you know
how many phone calls

09:14.588 --> 09:16.038
you can make in
three minutes?

09:16.038 --> 09:19.351
Almost forgot.
Call Mr. Bennett,
Health Department.

09:20.421 --> 09:23.114
Oh, Mrs. Blanchard,

09:23.114 --> 09:25.392
this is
Mrs. Willis.
Oh, hi.

09:25.392 --> 09:26.911
Just call me Fay.

09:26.911 --> 09:28.740
If you'll call me Helen.
Oh...

09:28.740 --> 09:31.122
Well, won't you
sit down?
Thank you.

09:31.122 --> 09:34.090
Louise has told me what
wonderful work
you've been doing.

09:34.090 --> 09:35.816
Oh, it's not me, Helen.

09:35.816 --> 09:37.335
It's people like Louise

09:37.335 --> 09:39.475
that keep
that Center going.

09:39.475 --> 09:42.961
I just try to put
the right person
in the right job,

09:42.961 --> 09:45.481
which is why I wanted to
see you today, Louise.

09:45.481 --> 09:47.690
As you know,
Doris Bingham,

09:47.690 --> 09:49.692
who's been editing
our monthly newsletter,

09:49.692 --> 09:51.245
is moving out of town.

09:51.245 --> 09:55.042
Oh, that reminds me.
Doris. Jewelry.

09:55.042 --> 09:57.769
How nice.
You're giving Doris
a going away present?

09:57.769 --> 09:59.184
Well, no.

09:59.184 --> 10:02.947
You see, she borrowed
my necklace 21 days ago.

10:02.947 --> 10:05.432
I wanna be sure to get it
back before she leaves.

10:06.191 --> 10:07.986
Oh, I see.

10:07.986 --> 10:10.230
Anyway, we need
a new editor,

10:10.230 --> 10:13.302
and I was wondering
if you'd be interested
in the job, Louise?

10:13.302 --> 10:15.649
Me?

10:15.649 --> 10:17.237
Oh, this is so sudden.

10:17.237 --> 10:19.895
How about it?

10:19.895 --> 10:21.897
Well...
Good.

10:21.897 --> 10:24.106
Now, here's some
old copies
of the newsletters,

10:24.106 --> 10:26.142
and some ideas
for new articles.

10:26.142 --> 10:27.316
Well,
I don't know...

10:27.316 --> 10:30.008
Louise, it would be
marvelous for you.

10:30.008 --> 10:31.492
It should be lots
of fun, Louise.

10:31.492 --> 10:33.702
Oh, you think so?
Sure.

10:33.702 --> 10:35.738
When Tom and I
were living in Europe,

10:35.738 --> 10:38.603
I put out a monthly
newsletter for
Americans living abroad.

10:38.603 --> 10:40.812
I was always the first one
to hear the latest gossip.

10:42.780 --> 10:44.678
Louise, dear,

10:44.678 --> 10:48.717
I don't have to tell you
how important that
newsletter is, do I?

10:48.717 --> 10:50.546
Oh, no.

10:50.546 --> 10:52.513
Good. That saves me
two minutes.

10:54.654 --> 10:58.209
I've never really done
much writing before.

10:58.209 --> 10:59.486
Oh, don't worry, Louise.

10:59.486 --> 11:00.798
If you need any help,
just ask me.

11:00.798 --> 11:03.041
I took some journalism
courses in college.

11:03.041 --> 11:04.249
You did?

11:04.249 --> 11:06.320
I am a
pretty good speller.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.943
Yes, at Columbia.

11:07.943 --> 11:10.566
And Mother Jefferson
says I write some
pretty good letters.

11:10.566 --> 11:12.879
And you used to edit
a newsletter in Europe?

11:12.879 --> 11:14.984
Mmm-hmm...
And I do know
how to type.

11:14.984 --> 11:18.712
Louise, I have
a great idea.

11:18.712 --> 11:20.369
Yes?

11:20.369 --> 11:24.718
Now, there is no sense
in forcing you
to do this newsletter.

11:24.718 --> 11:27.134
Why don't we make
Helen the editor?

11:28.377 --> 11:30.448
Helen?
Yes.

11:30.448 --> 11:33.589
With your background,
Helen dear, you'll be
perfect for the job.

11:33.589 --> 11:36.385
Won't she
be perfect, Louise?

11:36.385 --> 11:39.215
Helen?
Yes.

11:40.285 --> 11:42.322
Oh, well, sure.

11:42.322 --> 11:44.255
You'd be
perfect, Helen.

11:44.255 --> 11:46.602
Hey, how
'bout it, Helen?

11:46.602 --> 11:48.604
Well, this is
very flattering,

11:48.604 --> 11:50.744
but I don't even
work at the Center.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.435
You do now.

11:52.435 --> 11:54.058
New member package,
Helen Willis.

11:54.610 --> 11:55.887
Helen?

11:55.887 --> 11:58.338
Yes!

11:58.338 --> 12:01.548
Look over this material
and I'll get back to you
later, Helen dear.

12:01.548 --> 12:03.792
Well, I must
be going.
But...

12:03.792 --> 12:05.932
Fay...

12:05.932 --> 12:08.210
Would you
like some coffee?

12:08.210 --> 12:10.591
Yes, I would love some.

12:10.591 --> 12:14.078
But I can't.
I've gotta be cross town
in 17 and a half minutes

12:14.078 --> 12:15.907
for another meeting.

12:15.907 --> 12:17.529
Bye.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.635
Oh, so, uh,

12:19.635 --> 12:22.189
you used to live
in Europe, huh?

12:22.189 --> 12:25.158
Uh, yes. My husband and I
lived in Paris for two years.

12:25.158 --> 12:28.023
Really? Well, my husband
and I were in Paris

12:28.023 --> 12:30.853
for three months
and five days.

12:30.853 --> 12:32.303
We'll have to get together
and talk some time.

12:32.303 --> 12:35.306
I would love that!

12:35.306 --> 12:37.066
Helen, Paris.

12:38.654 --> 12:41.726
Oh, leave it to you to
find us such

12:41.726 --> 12:44.971
a really good editor.
Thank you, Louise dear.

12:44.971 --> 12:46.524
Goodbye, Helen dear.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.561
Uh, you're welcome, Fay...

12:51.391 --> 12:52.841
...dear.

12:52.841 --> 12:55.257
Oh, you're right, Louise.
She is an amazing woman.

12:55.257 --> 12:56.741
Yeah.
Oh...

12:56.741 --> 12:58.225
Better get busy.

12:58.225 --> 13:00.193
Uh, Helen,
what about the shopping?

13:00.193 --> 13:02.402
Oh, shopping?
That'll have to wait.

13:02.402 --> 13:03.955
I have to read over
this material

13:03.955 --> 13:05.854
and get busy
on the newsletter.

13:05.854 --> 13:07.131
See you later, girl.

13:07.131 --> 13:09.685
And thanks for introducing
me to Mrs. Blanchard.

13:11.929 --> 13:14.552
Sure.
Anything for a friend.

13:23.078 --> 13:25.114
Hey, Weez.

13:25.114 --> 13:26.564
Hi, George.

13:28.083 --> 13:29.463
Hey, Weezy,

13:29.463 --> 13:31.224
I heard this great joke
today about a bus way.

13:31.983 --> 13:33.226
What's a bus way?

13:33.226 --> 13:34.710
It depends on how many
people are on it...

13:38.990 --> 13:40.198
Don't you get it, Weezy?

13:40.198 --> 13:42.304
Depends on how many
people are on the bus!

13:44.030 --> 13:45.721
Yeah, George,
that's a riot.

13:45.721 --> 13:47.343
I knew you'd like it.

13:48.655 --> 13:51.623
Uh, did you meet with
Mrs. Blanchard today?

13:51.623 --> 13:54.316
Yes.
Did she come up here
about the newsletter?

13:54.316 --> 13:56.490
Yes.
Hey, that's great, Weezy.

13:56.490 --> 13:58.320
Come on, I'll take you out
to dinner to celebrate.

13:58.320 --> 13:59.942
Celebrate what?

13:59.942 --> 14:01.426
You being named editor.

14:01.426 --> 14:03.808
Forget it.
I'm not doing the newsletter.

14:03.808 --> 14:06.397
What? You didn't turn
it down, did you?

14:06.397 --> 14:09.193
No. Mrs. Blanchard
gave the job to Helen.

14:09.193 --> 14:10.504
Helen? Helen Willis?

14:11.402 --> 14:13.473
I only know one Helen.

14:13.473 --> 14:16.303
Yeah, one too many.
How'd she get into this?

14:16.303 --> 14:18.340
Well, she was here when
Ms. Blanchard came,

14:18.340 --> 14:21.067
and Mrs. Blanchard
made her editor.

14:21.067 --> 14:23.517
But I thought Mrs.
Blanchard wanted to make you
editor?

14:23.517 --> 14:25.968
She did.
But Mrs. Blanchard said...

14:25.968 --> 14:29.454
Well, Helen told...
Oh, it's a long story.

14:29.454 --> 14:32.526
Yeah. And I bet I know
how the story ends.
Helen stole your job.

14:32.526 --> 14:34.632
George, she didn't
steal my job.

14:34.632 --> 14:37.669
Besides, she'll probably
make a better editor anyway.

14:37.669 --> 14:40.396
Better editor? How is she
gonna make a better editor
than you, Weezy?

14:40.396 --> 14:42.329
You've been writing
since you was a kid.

14:42.329 --> 14:44.814
So has Helen.
Yeah, but you're
older than her.

14:46.816 --> 14:48.577
Well, look, Weezy,

14:48.577 --> 14:50.993
you've been working
at that Help Center now
for three months, right?

14:50.993 --> 14:52.236
Four.

14:52.236 --> 14:54.445
So what's Helen Willis got
that you ain't got?

14:54.445 --> 14:56.826
Well, for one thing,
she's got
a college education.

14:56.826 --> 14:59.381
College education?
That don't mean nothing.

14:59.381 --> 15:01.452
That's not what you
kept telling Lionel.

15:01.452 --> 15:03.385
Well, that's different.

15:03.385 --> 15:04.869
What's different about it?

15:04.869 --> 15:07.216
Look, Weezy, we are
not talking about
becoming an engineer.

15:07.216 --> 15:09.632
We're talking about
editing a newsletter.

15:09.632 --> 15:10.840
Any dummy can do that.

15:13.740 --> 15:16.053
Well, thanks a lot.

15:16.053 --> 15:19.125
What I mean is,
it ain't college that matters,
it's brains.

15:19.125 --> 15:20.920
You got a lot more brains
than Helen.

15:22.473 --> 15:24.820
She didn't even have
enough brains to marry one of
her own kind.

15:26.546 --> 15:29.031
Hello. Jefferson
residence.

15:29.031 --> 15:32.103
Oh, it's you.
Yeah, she's here, but she
don't wanna talk to you.

15:32.103 --> 15:33.622
Buzz off, turkey!

15:36.866 --> 15:39.662
Who was that?
Your ex-friend Helen.

15:39.662 --> 15:41.906
George, Helen is
still my friend!

15:41.906 --> 15:43.425
Friend?

15:43.425 --> 15:45.875
How could you call
somebody a friend who
did what she did?

15:45.875 --> 15:47.636
George, you're just mad

15:47.636 --> 15:50.294
because you think you
won't get a chance to
meet Mrs. Blanchard's husband.

15:50.294 --> 15:54.436
Weezy! That thought
never entered my mind.

15:54.436 --> 15:56.058
All I care about is you.

15:56.058 --> 15:58.336
And I don't like to
see no Helen Willis
walking all over you.

15:58.336 --> 16:00.890
In fact, I don't like to
see Helen Willis at all.

16:00.890 --> 16:02.616
George!
Look, Weezy,

16:02.616 --> 16:05.102
this morning you really
wanted that job. Right?

16:05.102 --> 16:06.689
I know, but...
And if it
wasn't for Helen,

16:06.689 --> 16:07.621
you would have had
it, right?

16:07.621 --> 16:09.554
Well...
And what does she do?

16:09.554 --> 16:12.557
She comes sneaking into
your apartment, right?

16:12.557 --> 16:15.353
Right...
And kisses up
to your friend, right?

16:15.353 --> 16:16.699
Right!

16:16.699 --> 16:18.563
And steals
your job, right?

16:18.563 --> 16:21.049
Right!
Now that's wrong, right?

16:21.049 --> 16:23.120
Damn right!
All right!

16:26.192 --> 16:27.814
Hi, Louise. I...
Buzz off, turkey!

16:34.924 --> 16:36.374
Was that Louise?

16:36.374 --> 16:37.755
It was Louise's body,

16:37.755 --> 16:39.826
but it sounded like
George's mouth.

16:41.483 --> 16:42.932
They're back again, Weezy,

16:42.932 --> 16:44.658
wearing out the doorbell.

16:44.658 --> 16:46.729
See that, Weezy,
you're too nice.

16:46.729 --> 16:48.283
What was
that all about?

16:48.283 --> 16:49.422
Yes, George,
what's going on?

16:49.422 --> 16:51.976
You two know damn well
what's going on.
We do?

16:51.976 --> 16:53.702
Come on, come on,
no need to try to play dumb.

16:53.702 --> 16:55.359
Why? You've been doing
it for years.

16:57.016 --> 17:00.571
Louise...
I told you, she don't
wanna talk to you!

17:00.571 --> 17:01.779
George,
if you don't mind,

17:01.779 --> 17:04.644
I think Louise should
speak for herself.

17:04.644 --> 17:07.026
Okay, I don't wanna talk
to you.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.131
There, see?

17:09.131 --> 17:10.581
Straight from
the horse's mouth.

17:15.172 --> 17:17.105
What's going on
around here?

17:17.105 --> 17:19.866
I'll clear it up for you.
You ain't wanted
around here.

17:19.866 --> 17:21.385
Don't you talk to
my wife like that!

17:21.385 --> 17:22.731
I'll talk anyway I want.

17:22.731 --> 17:24.871
Well, we don't
have to listen.
As a matter of fact...

17:24.871 --> 17:28.150
Hi, I'm back.
Who cares?

17:28.150 --> 17:30.842
Wait till you see
the new dress I got...
Who cares?

17:30.842 --> 17:33.569
Child, I found
this down at...
Who cares?

17:35.847 --> 17:37.918
Well, I thought y'all
would like to see my
new dress.

17:37.918 --> 17:40.438
ALL: Who cares?

17:40.438 --> 17:42.164
I do, that's who.

17:49.896 --> 17:51.587
Now just hold it.

17:51.587 --> 17:53.796
Obviously, there's some
misunderstanding here.

17:53.796 --> 17:55.867
There ain't
no misunderstanding.

17:55.867 --> 17:57.731
You Willises' have been
pulling stuff
like this for years.

17:57.731 --> 17:59.008
George, what are
you talking about?

17:59.008 --> 18:01.528
First your daughter
steals my son.

18:01.528 --> 18:03.668
Then your wife
steals Louise's job.

18:03.668 --> 18:05.222
Steals Louise's job?

18:05.222 --> 18:07.293
Helen did not steal
Louise's job.

18:07.293 --> 18:09.088
Did you, Helen?

18:11.814 --> 18:13.989
Oh, so that's it.

18:13.989 --> 18:17.510
It never entered my mind
that Louise wanted
to edit this newsletter.

18:17.510 --> 18:20.306
Of course it never
entered your mind,
'cause you ain't got none.

18:21.169 --> 18:22.515
All right, George.

18:22.515 --> 18:24.344
This time you have
really gone too far,

18:24.344 --> 18:26.450
you... You, honky!

18:26.450 --> 18:27.485
Ha!

18:29.108 --> 18:30.626
You calling me a honky?

18:30.626 --> 18:32.628
I couldn't
think of anything else.

18:35.942 --> 18:38.117
Louise...
I don't wanna hear it.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.430
Louise, I had no idea
you wanted to edit
this newsletter.

18:41.430 --> 18:43.605
Why didn't you say
something?

18:43.605 --> 18:46.366
How could I? You were
doing all the talking.

18:46.366 --> 18:48.782
"I studied journalism,
Mrs. Blanchard."

18:48.782 --> 18:52.683
"I edited a newsletter
when we were living in Paris,
Mrs. Blanchard."

18:52.683 --> 18:54.650
Well, we did
live in Paris.

18:54.650 --> 18:57.515
Well, why don't you move
back there?

18:57.515 --> 19:01.243
Look, Louise,
I'll resign and you
can edit the newsletter.

19:01.243 --> 19:03.694
Forget it. You wanted
the job? You've got it...

19:10.632 --> 19:12.116
What are you doing?

19:12.116 --> 19:13.393
I'm getting
the coffee for you.

19:13.393 --> 19:15.119
I can do that myself!

19:25.578 --> 19:27.856
I was just
trying to help.

19:27.856 --> 19:31.100
Help? I suppose you were
just trying to help

19:31.100 --> 19:33.724
when you were kissing up
to Mrs. Blanchard
today, huh?

19:33.724 --> 19:35.381
I was not
kissing up to her.

19:35.381 --> 19:37.141
The hell you weren't.

19:37.141 --> 19:39.350
Oh, come on, Louise,
I'm your friend.

19:40.627 --> 19:41.766
I'm not so sure.

19:41.766 --> 19:44.010
A friend wouldn't have
done what you did.

19:44.010 --> 19:45.563
Oh, so we're
not friends anymore?

19:45.563 --> 19:46.702
I guess not.

19:46.702 --> 19:49.464
Okay, if that's the
way you want it!

19:51.051 --> 19:53.122
I just hope you know
what you're doing.

19:53.122 --> 19:55.435
I know exactly
what I'm doing!

19:55.435 --> 19:56.678
Yeah?
Yeah!

19:56.678 --> 19:58.714
Then why are you putting
flour in your coffee pot?

20:00.889 --> 20:03.547
Oh... Oh, Helen...

20:03.547 --> 20:05.411
Wait.

20:05.411 --> 20:08.862
You wanna sit down and
let's have a cup of paste?

20:10.795 --> 20:13.315
Willis, if brains were
money, you'd be on welfare.

20:14.489 --> 20:17.112
Are you calling me dumb?
Yeah!

20:17.112 --> 20:19.908
I'd like to see you look
me straight in the eye and say
that.

20:19.908 --> 20:21.289
Okay.

20:22.531 --> 20:26.328
Dumb! Dumber! Dumbest!
More dumber! Most dumbest!

20:26.328 --> 20:27.985
George! George!
Most unusually dumb...

20:27.985 --> 20:29.538
George! Calm down!

20:31.678 --> 20:34.267
There's no sense in taking
a little thing like this

20:34.267 --> 20:36.062
and ruining our
friendship.

20:36.062 --> 20:38.651
Yeah, you're right.
We should make it
a great big thing, huh?

20:38.651 --> 20:40.066
Ha!

20:40.618 --> 20:41.826
Ha, ha...

20:41.826 --> 20:43.656
See this fancy martini
pitcher you gave us?

20:43.656 --> 20:45.658
Oh, the best of it's kind.
Beautiful, isn't it?

20:46.383 --> 20:48.108
George! No, wait!

20:48.108 --> 20:50.076
No, no, no, no, no.
Please.

20:50.076 --> 20:51.664
No! Oh...

20:52.975 --> 20:54.149
Oh, no you don't.

20:54.149 --> 20:55.668
No, no.

20:55.668 --> 20:58.498
You don't understand.
This is a martini pitcher.

20:58.498 --> 20:59.706
All right, Willis,
that's it. Get out.

20:59.706 --> 21:01.087
Get out! I'm through
talking to you.

21:01.087 --> 21:03.296
Well, then stop waving
your hand in my face.

21:03.296 --> 21:05.402
If you don't start moving,
I'm gonna ram my fist
through your face.

21:05.402 --> 21:06.989
George!
It's okay, Weezy,

21:06.989 --> 21:09.060
I'm about to throw
this turkey out.
Now you throw her out.

21:09.060 --> 21:11.270
George!

21:11.270 --> 21:12.857
We're not throwing
anybody out.

21:12.857 --> 21:14.928
The Willises' are
still our friends.

21:14.928 --> 21:16.275
They are?
Of course.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.690
What about
the newsletter?

21:17.690 --> 21:20.727
Well, Helen and I came
up with a great idea.

21:20.727 --> 21:22.764
We are going
to be co-editors.

21:22.764 --> 21:24.766
We figured two heads
are better than one.

21:24.766 --> 21:26.561
Especially if you have
a large family...

21:29.460 --> 21:31.359
Do you get it? Heads.

21:31.359 --> 21:33.775
You know, Navy talk.
John. Bathroom.

21:39.850 --> 21:41.403
We got it, dear.

21:41.403 --> 21:43.992
Oh, Louise,
it should be great fun

21:43.992 --> 21:45.373
working on that
newsletter together.

21:45.373 --> 21:47.961
Oh, yeah, wouldn't
that look nice?

21:47.961 --> 21:50.999
"Edited by Helen Willis
and Louise Jefferson."

21:50.999 --> 21:52.449
Hey, wait a minute.

21:52.449 --> 21:55.072
How come that don't say
"Louise Jefferson
and Helen Willis"?

21:55.072 --> 21:56.832
Oh, George...
Well, it's
only fair, Weezy.

21:56.832 --> 21:58.800
I mean, you've been
working at that Help Center
longer than her.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.249
Well, why don't
you go alphabetically?

22:00.249 --> 22:02.321
Oh, look, just don't try
to get slick, Willis.

22:03.391 --> 22:07.222
A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J...

22:07.222 --> 22:09.362
Hey, right,
that's a good idea.

22:11.951 --> 22:14.333
Come on, George,
let's celebrate
with some drinks.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.335
Oh, good idea!

22:16.335 --> 22:18.337
Hey...
Hey, Weezy, watch.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.476
You ain't gonna
believe this.

22:19.476 --> 22:21.201
This pitcher don't break.

22:21.201 --> 22:23.445
Uh, George,
that's a very expensive...

22:25.274 --> 22:27.242
But it didn't
do that before!

22:27.932 --> 22:29.934
Oh, George...

22:40.393 --> 22:42.119
Day-o!

22:43.154 --> 22:45.225
Day-o!

22:45.225 --> 22:49.057
Daylight come
and I wanna go home

22:49.057 --> 22:50.679
Day...

22:50.679 --> 22:53.268
Me say day,
say day say day say

22:54.407 --> 22:56.651
Daylight come

22:56.651 --> 23:00.655
And I wanna go home

23:00.655 --> 23:01.897
Come, Mr. tally
man...

23:01.897 --> 23:05.314
We can go home if you'd
quit your day-oing
and opened the door.

23:06.419 --> 23:07.765
That was a wild party,
wasn't it, Weezy?

23:07.765 --> 23:10.872
Yeah. And you were
the wildest one there.

23:10.872 --> 23:12.908
I don't think you
sat down all night.

23:12.908 --> 23:15.635
Well, I had to show
them West Indian people
how to dance, didn't I?

23:15.635 --> 23:17.775
You show them
how to dance?

23:17.775 --> 23:20.571
Sure. I won the limbo
contest, didn't I?

23:20.571 --> 23:23.056
Yeah. That's because
you were the only one

23:23.056 --> 23:25.265
who didn't have to bend
to go under the broomstick.

23:28.027 --> 23:29.787
Come on, Florence.

23:29.787 --> 23:33.170
Oh, George, we left
Florence in the elevator.

23:33.170 --> 23:35.172
Oh, I think she had
too much rum.

23:35.172 --> 23:36.932
She was acting
a little silly.

23:36.932 --> 23:38.106
I didn't notice
nothing different.

23:39.659 --> 23:42.455
Back to back,
belly to belly

23:42.455 --> 23:45.769
I don't give a damn
I done dead already

23:46.908 --> 23:47.978
Florence...

23:47.978 --> 23:49.704
...are you all right?

23:49.704 --> 23:52.051
Oh, I'm fine. But this
room keep going up and down.

23:53.915 --> 23:56.952
Hey, Florence, come on,
we gotta get you to bed.

23:56.952 --> 23:59.127
Bed? Take your hands off me!

23:59.127 --> 24:00.749
I can make it by myself.

24:02.648 --> 24:05.582
Florence, I don't think
you can walk a straight line.

24:05.582 --> 24:07.756
Oh, yeah?
Watch me...

24:10.932 --> 24:12.727
Okay. Come on, Florence...

24:18.249 --> 24:19.734
Uh, Florence,
you shouldn't have...

24:21.529 --> 24:24.670
Hey, you
shouldn't... Oh...

24:24.670 --> 24:26.810
Weezy, don't worry
about Florence.

24:26.810 --> 24:29.433
George, in her condition,
she'll never get back here.

24:29.433 --> 24:30.814
Yeah, ain't that great?
Come on.

24:51.766 --> 24:55.494
LOUISE: The Jeffersonswas
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.

25:07.022 --> 25:08.783
Movin',
movin' on up
