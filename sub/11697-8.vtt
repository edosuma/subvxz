WEBVTT

00:01.289 --> 00:02.390
Stop. Gimme that!

00:02.391 --> 00:04.388
I've got it. Quit yapping at me,

00:04.389 --> 00:08.090
Play nice, Danny.
Or at least give him a step ladder.

00:12.589 --> 00:15.290
Okay, people.
I need a clean shirt and a clean baby,

00:15.291 --> 00:16.790
not necessarily in that order.

00:16.791 --> 00:18.990
Emma, you ready for
your first playdate?

00:19.085 --> 00:21.086
Okay now. Remember, Emma,
what we talked about.

00:21.285 --> 00:23.017
Just because
he buys you formula

00:23.018 --> 00:25.019
doesn't mean you need
to share your toys.

00:26.856 --> 00:28.990
She's actually pretty smitten with
her new little friend Jordan.

00:29.024 --> 00:30.925
Well, she's also having
an affair with her thumb,

00:30.960 --> 00:32.961
so I wouldn't be picking
out china just yet.

00:34.063 --> 00:35.764
Honey, I think
it's so cute that you

00:35.798 --> 00:37.665
joined a Mommy and Me class.

00:37.700 --> 00:38.933
Room full of hot mommies?

00:38.968 --> 00:40.602
- Yeah, he's selfless.
- ( Scoffs )

00:41.937 --> 00:43.905
This is about Emma, okay?

00:43.939 --> 00:46.574
Jordan's mom Isabelle
is amazing.

00:46.609 --> 00:49.043
People actually call her
the "mommy whisperer."

00:49.078 --> 00:50.779
Funny.
That used to be

00:50.813 --> 00:52.680
your father's nickname.

00:53.716 --> 00:54.916
She runs
the whole program.

00:54.950 --> 00:56.851
There's a huge waiting list
for her class.

00:56.886 --> 00:59.954
But, using a little
of the patented Wheeler charm,

00:59.989 --> 01:01.990
Emma and I have jumped
to the front of the list.

01:02.024 --> 01:04.626
We pass our playdate audition
today, and we're in.

01:04.660 --> 01:05.960
<i>- ( Music from TV playing )</i>
<i>- </i> We're in! Yes!

01:05.995 --> 01:07.762
- Finally!
- Whoo! Yes!

01:07.797 --> 01:08.863
<i>Today is gonna be</i>
<i>all about yelling,</i>

01:08.898 --> 01:11.599
swearing and full-on
body blows.

01:11.634 --> 01:12.734
( Mouths )

01:12.768 --> 01:14.769
Sounds like
my wedding night.

01:17.640 --> 01:18.940
Boxing. It's the
pay-per-view fight

01:18.974 --> 01:20.542
- of the decade.
- <i>Yup.</i>

01:20.576 --> 01:22.710
And watching it
is how we stay manly.

01:22.745 --> 01:23.711
Ohh.

01:23.746 --> 01:25.847
Yeah, okay,
that should do it.

01:27.616 --> 01:29.784
Oh! It's okay, Emma.
Here we go.

01:29.819 --> 01:30.819
Three-second rule.

01:30.853 --> 01:32.821
No! No-second rule.

01:32.855 --> 01:33.922
Izzy said
that's a myth.

01:33.956 --> 01:35.557
Do you have any idea
what kind of germs

01:35.591 --> 01:36.591
you're exposing her to?

01:36.625 --> 01:37.692
Honey, when I was
raising you boys,

01:37.726 --> 01:39.761
it was a three-day rule.

01:39.795 --> 01:42.030
If you kept it down,
it was safe.

01:42.064 --> 01:44.065
If you didn't--
well, that's why we had a dog.

01:45.768 --> 01:47.836
Well, Izzy has this
simple list of rules

01:47.870 --> 01:49.571
that every parent
needs to follow.

01:49.605 --> 01:50.972
It's amazing how much
I don't know.

01:51.006 --> 01:52.807
We're all amazed
at that, honey.

01:54.043 --> 01:55.710
And I've got
a list too.

01:55.744 --> 01:58.713
Chips, beer,
salsa, guacamole

01:58.747 --> 02:00.615
- and you be home by 8:00.
- ( Mouths )

02:00.649 --> 02:02.684
Please.
I'm <i>so</i> on it.

02:02.718 --> 02:03.852
And I'm so late.

02:03.886 --> 02:05.587
The first thing
on Izzy's list:

02:05.621 --> 02:06.788
Be prepared
for everything.

02:09.692 --> 02:10.692
The second thing
on the list:

02:10.726 --> 02:12.527
Don't forget
the baby.

02:12.561 --> 02:14.629

02:25.774 --> 02:28.743
So maybe not
the best day for the park.

02:28.777 --> 02:30.645
- If you need to dry off--
- We're good.

02:30.679 --> 02:33.715
Rain or shine,
we're always prepared.

02:33.749 --> 02:35.984
Make yourself comfortable,
while we recycle our raincoats.

02:37.953 --> 02:39.954
It smells very...

02:39.989 --> 02:41.723
( Inhales )

02:41.757 --> 02:43.625
Male.

02:43.659 --> 02:45.793
On behalf of the three men
who live here,

02:45.828 --> 02:46.828
thank you.

02:47.997 --> 02:49.030
Look, we're sorta new

02:49.064 --> 02:50.798
on the whole
baby-dating scene,

02:50.833 --> 02:52.700
so I'm not really sure
what comes next.

02:52.735 --> 02:53.968
A little peek-a-boo.

02:54.003 --> 02:56.004
Maybe some spin-the-bottle.

02:57.039 --> 02:58.840
That's hilarious.

02:58.874 --> 03:00.708
But it's almost time
for Jordan's nap

03:00.743 --> 03:03.544
and I can't imagine
putting him down

03:03.579 --> 03:04.646
anywhere here,

03:04.680 --> 03:06.681
so we should...

03:08.717 --> 03:10.685
Probably be going.

03:10.719 --> 03:11.853
No no no no.
Please don't.

03:11.887 --> 03:13.588
I know we're
probably not up

03:13.622 --> 03:14.622
to your usual standards.

03:14.657 --> 03:16.958
And the place could use
a touch more...

03:16.992 --> 03:18.793
- Baby-proofing.
- "A touch?"

03:18.827 --> 03:20.728
She says, looking
at a giant dartboard

03:20.763 --> 03:22.730
and 75 choking hazards.

03:24.600 --> 03:25.800
Ben, I'm sorry.
I just don't know

03:25.834 --> 03:27.835
if you're taking your role
as a parent seriously enough.

03:27.870 --> 03:29.938
And that's why we need
to be in your class.

03:29.972 --> 03:32.941
We're tired of being
pathetic "Befores."

03:32.975 --> 03:34.976
( Exaggerated sigh )

03:39.815 --> 03:41.816
We wanna be
happy "Afters."

03:43.018 --> 03:44.686
( Laughs )

03:45.821 --> 03:47.555
We need to be
Izzied.

03:47.589 --> 03:49.557
Yay, Izzy!

03:49.591 --> 03:50.892
( Giggles )

03:50.926 --> 03:53.861
I guess I could do
a private home intensive.

03:53.896 --> 03:57.732
A one-on-one where we go through
everything in the place.

03:57.766 --> 03:58.967
Yes! Thank you.

03:59.001 --> 04:00.969
Maybe we could
do it over dinner.

04:00.971 --> 04:02.537
My mom's got
Jordan tonight,

04:02.571 --> 04:03.938
which just means
dohe'll probably know

04:03.973 --> 04:05.974
how to mix a Martini
before he's two.

04:07.810 --> 04:09.744
Tonight?
As in this evening?

04:09.778 --> 04:10.812
Hours from now?

04:10.846 --> 04:12.547
It's really
the only time I have.

04:12.581 --> 04:13.648
And there's no way
that I could let

04:13.682 --> 04:14.716
the two of you
into my class.

04:14.750 --> 04:15.783
Then tonight it is!

04:15.818 --> 04:16.851
But I'm just
letting you know,

04:16.885 --> 04:18.619
I'm a really fast learner,

04:18.654 --> 04:19.853
so get ready to put
the baby pedal

04:19.887 --> 04:22.557
to the daddy metal.
( Chuckles )

04:24.560 --> 04:25.960
I have no idea
what that means.

04:28.030 --> 04:29.897
Ben, honey, there is
such a thing as being

04:29.965 --> 04:31.499
too protective.

04:31.533 --> 04:34.535
Did I pick you up
every time you cried? No.

04:34.570 --> 04:36.637
Did I feed you
every time you were hungry?

04:36.672 --> 04:37.672
No.

04:39.575 --> 04:41.009
Did I fix those
frayed wires

04:41.043 --> 04:42.643
behind the TV?
I mean, what am I?

04:42.678 --> 04:44.812
An electrician?

04:44.847 --> 04:47.648
Come on, Ben,
you turned out--

04:47.683 --> 04:49.050
well, you are still here.

04:51.053 --> 04:53.621
I feel so coddled.

04:53.655 --> 04:54.856
Well, you should,
since I'm making dinner

04:54.890 --> 04:56.057
for you and lady goo-goo.

04:57.893 --> 04:59.560
Hey, that's organic
chicken, right?

04:59.595 --> 05:00.628
She only eats organic.

05:00.662 --> 05:01.863
Yeah, right.
Like I'm going to spend

05:01.897 --> 05:03.798
40 bucks on a breast
of chicken.

05:03.832 --> 05:05.833
I don't spend that much
per cup on a bra.

05:07.669 --> 05:09.604
Mom! This is important.

05:09.638 --> 05:10.938
Honey, your brother is 6'5"

05:10.973 --> 05:12.874
and he grew up
eating dirt.

<i>( Door opens )</i>

05:14.643 --> 05:15.777
I did it!

05:15.811 --> 05:16.911
I got the job.

05:16.945 --> 05:19.580
You are looking
at the newest employee

05:19.615 --> 05:21.582
of Bender, Bowman, Brockman

05:21.617 --> 05:23.951
and some guy whose name
I can't pronounce.

05:24.987 --> 05:26.687
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

05:26.722 --> 05:30.892
Wow. That's a really
long name for a strip club.

05:30.926 --> 05:31.993
It's a law firm

05:32.027 --> 05:33.895
and I start my internship
on Monday.

05:33.929 --> 05:36.564
Well, then you better
find the rest of that skirt

05:36.598 --> 05:37.765
before then because

05:37.800 --> 05:40.001
I can kinda see
your tonsils.

05:41.670 --> 05:43.671
This is the most
conservative thing I have.

05:43.705 --> 05:45.773
Well, Emma and I are
heading to the outlet mall

05:45.808 --> 05:46.941
for their monthly
madness sale.

05:46.975 --> 05:49.677
It's 40% off
of 40% off.

05:49.711 --> 05:51.712
Which I think means,
they pay you.

05:53.649 --> 05:56.617
Well, I actually could use
a couple of new suits.

05:56.652 --> 05:57.952
Here's something
I'm gonna regret.

05:57.986 --> 05:59.554
Mrs. Wheeler,

05:59.588 --> 06:00.655
will you take
me shopping?

06:00.689 --> 06:02.590
Absolutely.
I can always use

06:02.624 --> 06:04.625
somebody to block
those perfume ladies.

06:05.761 --> 06:07.562
Those bitches are tough.

06:08.864 --> 06:10.765
But we should probably get
going before the fight starts.

06:10.799 --> 06:12.767
Oh, that's right.

06:12.801 --> 06:14.702
I forgot the fight
of the decade is tonight.

06:14.736 --> 06:16.637
No. I mean the one
Ben's gonna be getting into

06:16.672 --> 06:18.706
with the boys when they find
out that he's ditching them

06:18.740 --> 06:19.841
for dizzy.

06:20.843 --> 06:22.577
- Izzy.
- Whatever.

06:23.679 --> 06:25.813
Hey, it's for Emma.
They'll understand.

06:25.848 --> 06:27.548
I don't understand!

06:27.583 --> 06:28.816
Do you not see
that we've instituted

06:28.851 --> 06:31.552
- a leave-no-chip-behind policy?
- Yeah.

06:32.721 --> 06:33.921
You cannot pull the plug.

06:33.956 --> 06:36.724
I'm making my famous
five-layer bean dip.

06:37.926 --> 06:39.627
I thought we were
doing my onion dip.

06:39.661 --> 06:40.928
Well, maybe we can try
something different.

06:40.963 --> 06:41.963
Guys!

06:44.633 --> 06:45.766
I'm really sorry,
but you'll have to find

06:45.801 --> 06:46.934
somewhere else
to watch the fight.

06:46.969 --> 06:48.736
We all have to make
some sacrifices.

06:48.770 --> 06:50.905
Oh, I know exactly
who I'm sacrificing.

06:52.007 --> 06:54.542
Yeah, we wanna watch
the fight in our home

06:54.576 --> 06:56.544
with our stuff
on our television!

06:56.578 --> 06:58.579
Yeah, this is
unacceptable behavior.

06:58.614 --> 07:00.581
We are so revoking
your bro card.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.818
Well, feel free
to put it in this box

07:03.852 --> 07:05.653
with the rest of
your non-baby-friendly crap

07:05.687 --> 07:07.722
and dump it
in the storage cage.

07:07.756 --> 07:09.757
I've got important
Mommy and Me business.

07:11.827 --> 07:13.628
<i>( Door shuts )</i>

07:13.662 --> 07:15.696

how weak that sounds?

07:15.731 --> 07:17.732
<i>( Ben shouts )</i>
<i>Yes, he does!</i>

07:19.701 --> 07:21.569
You were amazing.

07:21.603 --> 07:23.838
The way you just ripped that
shirt right out of her hands.

07:23.872 --> 07:25.740
That's why they
call it a tag sale.

07:25.774 --> 07:26.908
I tagged her right
on her ass--

07:26.942 --> 07:28.609
just ka-blam!

07:28.644 --> 07:31.579
Excuse me. Ladies.

07:31.613 --> 07:32.980
Normally I
would buy cookies

07:33.015 --> 07:34.916
from your troop, sir,
but I just dropped

07:34.950 --> 07:35.917
a boatload of cash--

07:35.951 --> 07:37.752
let's cut the chatter.

07:37.786 --> 07:39.620
I got a 942 in progress.

07:40.889 --> 07:41.889
Follow me, please.

07:41.924 --> 07:43.591
I'm sorry,
is there a problem?

07:43.625 --> 07:45.593
Yeah. You're under arrest.

07:45.627 --> 07:47.962
Let's fall
in line, blondies.

07:52.834 --> 07:54.802
Dude, I can't believe
you didn't have enough room

07:54.836 --> 07:56.938
in your storage cage
for some boxes.

07:56.972 --> 07:58.706
You gotta get rid
of some of that crap.

07:58.740 --> 07:59.874
Dude, I can't help it.

07:59.908 --> 08:02.577
All that furniture
belonged to my nana.

08:02.611 --> 08:05.580
And I had my first kiss
on that couch.

08:05.614 --> 08:06.747
Could we please
just dump these

08:06.782 --> 08:07.915
and find a place
to watch the fight?

08:09.985 --> 08:11.819
- Okay.
- ( Sighs )

08:11.853 --> 08:12.853
Wait!

08:14.623 --> 08:15.856
Is that a cable outlet?

08:17.559 --> 08:18.693
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

08:18.727 --> 08:19.860
Yeah.

08:19.895 --> 08:21.896
We need to find a place
to watch the fight.

08:24.866 --> 08:27.668
- Both: Oh!
- Yeah.

08:29.738 --> 08:30.738
Guys?

08:37.746 --> 08:40.748
Where is everything?

08:43.652 --> 08:44.685
I believe
the laundry room

08:44.720 --> 08:46.587
is officially
back in order.

08:46.622 --> 08:47.922
Who needs Ben?

08:47.956 --> 08:49.824
More importantly,
who needs beer? Okay.

08:49.858 --> 08:51.492
This guy.

08:51.526 --> 08:52.927
( Playfully groans )

08:52.961 --> 08:54.996
( Laughs ) Mmm.

08:58.061 --> 09:00.809
Okay, water boiled for pasta-- check.

09:00.810 --> 09:03.778
Salad in a bag I'll pretend
I made myself-- check.

09:03.813 --> 09:06.815
Sweating through
my nice shirt-- double check.

09:06.849 --> 09:08.883
Okay, now what?

09:08.918 --> 09:10.151
Cut the chicken
into bite-sized pieces.

09:10.186 --> 09:11.186
Right.

09:17.259 --> 09:18.259
<i>( Tucker laughing )</i>

09:19.995 --> 09:21.096
Where have you guys been?
I've been calling you

09:21.130 --> 09:22.097
for over an hour.

09:22.131 --> 09:23.932
No reception
in the man cave.

09:23.966 --> 09:25.934
The where?
It doesn't matter.

09:25.968 --> 09:27.235
Thank you for getting
on board with this.

09:27.269 --> 09:30.071
I say onion <i>and</i> bean.

09:30.106 --> 09:32.107
- I say I love you.
- ( Chuckles )

09:34.844 --> 09:36.211
I'll text you as soon
as Izzy's gone

09:36.245 --> 09:37.812
and you can bring back
the TV

09:37.847 --> 09:39.147
and my bro card.

09:39.181 --> 09:40.815
We're good.
Maybe you can catch

09:40.850 --> 09:42.083
the fight down
at the bar.

09:42.118 --> 09:43.118
Oh, is that where
you're watching it?

09:43.152 --> 09:44.953
Nope.

09:44.987 --> 09:46.221
So you're not
gonna tell me where?

09:46.755 --> 09:48.123
Don't see
why we should.

09:48.157 --> 09:50.225
Not really something
you seem interested in.

09:50.259 --> 09:52.293
Really? Could you
be more childish?

09:55.164 --> 09:57.065
( Whining )
Please.

09:57.099 --> 10:00.068
Laundry room.
It's so cool!

10:00.102 --> 10:02.303
What is the point
in having a No-Ben club

10:02.338 --> 10:05.073
- when you invite Ben?
- <i>( Door opens )</i>

10:05.107 --> 10:07.275
- Knock knock.
- Izzy, hey.

10:07.309 --> 10:08.943
Just take this
baby monitor

10:08.978 --> 10:10.245
and let me know if
anything big happens.

10:10.279 --> 10:12.247
Thank you for coming.
My brother and my roommate,

10:12.281 --> 10:13.915
both giant supporters.

10:13.949 --> 10:16.317
- Hi.
- Oh, I actually just sanitized.

10:17.853 --> 10:18.853
Boo!

10:20.856 --> 10:22.157
Enjoy baby-proofing
the apartment,

10:22.191 --> 10:24.893
and we'll be downstairs
dull-proofing our lives.

10:27.897 --> 10:31.032
Wow. Ben,
I am so impressed.

10:31.066 --> 10:33.034
Do not need to tell
me anything twice.

10:33.068 --> 10:35.203
( Giggles ) Then this
should take no time at all.

10:35.237 --> 10:36.971
And we'll be able
to get to the

10:37.006 --> 10:38.273
one-on-one portion
of the evening.

10:38.307 --> 10:40.875
Isn't that what we--

10:40.910 --> 10:44.145
Oh. Didn't realize
daddy had a playdate.

10:46.248 --> 10:48.950
( Radio static ) This is the
Tom Man at home base-- over.

10:48.984 --> 10:51.853
( Static )
Come in sector 21.

10:51.887 --> 10:54.856
( Imitates radio static )
This is Bonnie in security.

10:54.890 --> 10:57.091
Come in, fatpants.
( Imitates static )

10:57.126 --> 10:58.927
( Imitates static )
Hey there, Bonnie.

10:58.961 --> 11:00.161
Looks like we're
gonna be cellmates.

11:00.196 --> 11:01.830
I call top bunk!

11:01.864 --> 11:03.231
- ( Imitates static )
- Guess there was

11:03.265 --> 11:05.233
a two-for-one sale
on wisenheimers.

11:05.267 --> 11:07.168
You two ladies
wanna tamp it down?

11:07.203 --> 11:09.904
( Valley girl accent )
Please don't call my mom.

11:09.939 --> 11:11.973
She will totally
freak out.

11:12.007 --> 11:14.242
And if she grounds me,
I'm gonna miss prom.

11:14.276 --> 11:18.246
And I think that David
and I might actually...

11:18.280 --> 11:19.280
Do it.

11:21.183 --> 11:23.218
- ( Imitates accent ) Shut up.
- You shut up.

11:23.252 --> 11:24.853
The two of you
shut up.

11:27.022 --> 11:28.890
You two should take
this act on the road.

11:28.924 --> 11:30.158
Oh! But you can't.

11:30.192 --> 11:31.926
Because where I come from,

11:31.961 --> 11:33.862
using an innocent
little baby to steal

11:33.896 --> 11:35.263
a diamond watch
is what we like to call

11:35.297 --> 11:37.298
a felony.

11:37.333 --> 11:40.001
Where did that come from?
We didn't put that in there.

11:40.035 --> 11:42.003
Tell it to your
parole officer, sister!

11:42.037 --> 11:43.137
Now, if you'll excuse me,

11:43.172 --> 11:45.173
I need to get
the proper paperwork.

11:47.877 --> 11:50.078
Oh my God! A felony?

11:50.112 --> 11:51.846
I could lose
my internship.

11:51.881 --> 11:53.114
I could get disbarred

11:53.148 --> 11:54.849
before I'm even barred.

11:54.884 --> 11:55.950
How could you
do this to me?

11:55.985 --> 11:57.952
Oh, you actually think
I stole a watch

11:57.987 --> 11:59.187
and shoved it
into Emma's stroller?

11:59.221 --> 12:01.089
How should I know?!
You're a crazy person.

12:02.258 --> 12:03.958
If I do become a lawyer,

12:03.993 --> 12:05.793
the first thing
I'm gonna do

12:05.828 --> 12:06.828
is sue you.

- ( Scoffs )
- ( Mockingly ) What do you think

12:25.881 --> 12:27.949
is better--
baby oil or baby powder?

12:27.983 --> 12:29.884
( Seriously ) Oh well, I
personally like the oil the best

12:29.919 --> 12:32.053
because it leaves
my skin blemish-free

I don't know.

12:57.813 --> 13:00.414
I guess I could go
for a little extra credit.

Ben, what are you
doing out there?

And the-- oh!
This wine--

13:21.803 --> 13:23.671
it tastes like...

13:23.705 --> 13:24.805
Freedom.

13:26.091 --> 13:27.225
It is just so good

13:27.259 --> 13:28.426
to get out of the house.

13:28.460 --> 13:31.095
Five hours a month
is all I have to myself

13:31.129 --> 13:33.197

Do you have any idea
what this means?

13:44.509 --> 13:47.144
Yeah. We're paying
retail from now on.

13:47.179 --> 13:49.146
Mrs. Wheeler,
you have ruined my life!

13:49.181 --> 13:50.314
Okay, let's calm down.

13:50.349 --> 13:51.549
We can't turn on each other.

13:51.583 --> 13:54.151
- That's what they want.
- Oh-ho, I'll sing.

13:54.186 --> 13:55.152
I'll tell them everything.

13:55.187 --> 13:57.488
Obviously, Emma just
grabbed it.

13:57.522 --> 13:59.557
She's at that stage.

13:59.591 --> 14:01.125
All right, listen--

14:01.159 --> 14:03.127
when walkie-talkie Tommy
gets back in here,

14:03.161 --> 14:04.462
just use your powers
of persuasion

14:04.496 --> 14:06.297
and get us out
of this.

14:07.399 --> 14:09.200
Well, I have picked up
a few legal moves.

14:09.234 --> 14:10.268
I meant use
your skinny little butt

14:10.302 --> 14:11.369
and shake what
weight watchers gave you.

14:11.403 --> 14:13.137
Huh? Huh? Huh?

14:13.171 --> 14:15.139
That is called entrapment.

14:15.173 --> 14:17.041
Or solicitation,
or something...

14:22.180 --> 14:23.147
All right, here.

14:23.181 --> 14:25.049
Fine, I will do it.

14:25.083 --> 14:26.384
Okay.

14:26.418 --> 14:28.219
Huh, yeah, okay.

14:28.253 --> 14:29.487
Ah, okay.

14:29.521 --> 14:31.355
Oh my God,
we're so going to prison.

14:36.395 --> 14:37.395
Huh?

14:40.098 --> 14:41.432
- What's this?
- Shh.

14:41.466 --> 14:43.434
20 bucks and a coffee
card with at least

14:43.468 --> 14:45.469
five freebies
still on it.

14:45.504 --> 14:47.471
I don't drink coffee.

14:48.206 --> 14:49.507
And that's bribery.

14:49.541 --> 14:51.375
Oh! That's what it was.

14:53.111 --> 14:55.179
You know the worst part

what should I do?

14:57.549 --> 14:59.417
Izzy, what's
wrong with my baby?"

How the hell should I know?
It's a baby.

lot of weird stuff.

I don't know what Ramona
was saying to Jorge,

but she was <i>pissed.</i>

15:21.440 --> 15:22.440
Danny:
<i>Man cave to baby daddy.</i>

15:22.474 --> 15:24.208
I should just put it away.

15:25.210 --> 15:27.178
And I am gonna go
freshen up

15:27.212 --> 15:28.512
because I still have
three and a half hours

15:28.547 --> 15:30.247

<i>Come in, man cave.</i>

15:32.484 --> 15:33.517

Tucker and Danny: <i>Whoa!</i>

15:35.487 --> 15:37.254
What? What just happened?

15:37.289 --> 15:40.458

<i>- Tucker:</i> <i>Oh my God!</i>

15:40.492 --> 15:43.127
- Who's down?!
- ( Monitor clicks )

15:43.161 --> 15:46.297
Izzy, I'll be right back!
I just need run next door to borrow...

15:46.331 --> 15:47.565
Something I don't
have here.

15:50.135 --> 15:52.136
Hey! What do you say
we go out dancing?

15:53.505 --> 15:55.406
Ben?

15:55.440 --> 15:57.375
- No no no no, get up.
- Come on. Go.

15:57.409 --> 15:58.376
- What did I miss?
- <i>( Bell rings )</i>

15:58.410 --> 15:59.477

15:59.511 --> 16:01.345
Truly saved by the bell!

16:01.380 --> 16:03.280
You just missed
the most incredible round.

16:03.315 --> 16:04.348
( Groans )

16:04.383 --> 16:06.183
Okay well, remember
everything.

16:06.218 --> 16:07.418
I don't know if I can
get back down here.

16:09.287 --> 16:10.287
What's with the door?

16:10.322 --> 16:11.389
Don't close it
all the way.

16:11.423 --> 16:13.124
It'll lock
from the outside.

16:13.158 --> 16:15.159
<i>( Bangs on door )</i>

16:17.129 --> 16:18.396
Welcome to Mantopia.

we settled on Brotown.

16:26.256 --> 16:28.055
Help! Anyone...

16:28.056 --> 16:29.023
What are we gonna do?

16:29.057 --> 16:30.190
How are we gonna get
out of here?

16:30.225 --> 16:32.126
I don't care,
but your girly whining

16:32.160 --> 16:34.828
is upsetting the level
of manhood in here.

16:35.614 --> 16:36.981
I could spend
the rest of my life

16:37.015 --> 16:38.783
in this room.

16:38.817 --> 16:39.817
Uh-oh, cable's out.

16:39.851 --> 16:41.986

We're gonna die in here!

16:42.020 --> 16:44.855
Oh no!
They will never find us!

16:44.890 --> 16:46.724
You cannot eat me first.

16:47.826 --> 16:50.561
And according
to statute 189--

16:50.595 --> 16:52.963
or perhaps 237--

16:52.998 --> 16:54.632
of the bylaws
of this state,

16:54.666 --> 16:55.800
you are prohibited

46 hours and 20 minutes
to go.

17:00.806 --> 17:01.939

17:01.973 --> 17:04.575
Well, color me shocked.

Hey! I have dedicated my life
to protecting this mall.

17:07.846 --> 17:09.747
I did not pick this job.

17:09.781 --> 17:11.515
The job picked me.

17:11.550 --> 17:13.784
Look, charge us
or let us go.

17:13.819 --> 17:16.686
Either way, I'm gonna need
to get my parking validated.

17:16.722 --> 17:18.955
I'll just walkie
the cops, hmm?

17:18.990 --> 17:20.925
They'll get your
real name, Siegfried.

17:23.895 --> 17:25.730
Wait-- my walkie.

- Don't panic.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.868
You had it with you when you
ran out to that staff meeting.

17:30.902 --> 17:32.603
Right! The men's room.

17:32.637 --> 17:34.872
You two don't move!

17:34.906 --> 17:37.708
Lock it down, people!
I'm off walkie!

17:37.743 --> 17:39.877
I repeat--
I am off walkie!

17:39.911 --> 17:41.545
( Whining )
No no no.

17:41.580 --> 17:42.613
We're locked in.

17:42.647 --> 17:43.914
What are we gonna do?

17:43.949 --> 17:45.816
Bam!

17:45.851 --> 17:48.586
And bam!

17:50.689 --> 17:51.989
Let's go, Siegfried.

17:52.023 --> 17:54.024
- I'm springing you.
- Yes!

17:55.894 --> 17:56.961
I'm in!

17:56.995 --> 17:58.629
Now go!

17:58.663 --> 17:59.797
Crawl for help,
little buddy.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.601
I can't believe
what an idiot I am.

18:03.635 --> 18:05.870
- I can.
- Me too.

18:05.904 --> 18:07.538
I ruined Emma's chances.

18:07.572 --> 18:08.873
I just wanted to do something
great for her.

18:08.907 --> 18:10.608
Ben, you do something
great for Emma

18:10.642 --> 18:11.776
every time you
look at her and say,

18:11.810 --> 18:13.744
"hi, baby.
It's me, Daddy."

18:15.514 --> 18:17.581
- You really think so?
- I do.

18:17.616 --> 18:19.550
I'm sorry I called
you selfish.

18:19.584 --> 18:21.552
It's cool.
I ignored you.

18:22.921 --> 18:24.822
What about you, Tuck?
Will you forgive me?

18:24.856 --> 18:26.690
I'm not budging.

18:26.725 --> 18:28.859
Why do you have
to be so difficult, Tucker?

18:28.894 --> 18:30.795
- I just apologized.
- Tucker: <i>No.</i>

18:30.829 --> 18:32.730
I'm not moving.

18:33.764 --> 18:34.732
<i>I am stuck.</i>

18:36.668 --> 18:37.835
Get me out of here!

18:44.609 --> 18:45.810
Ben really knows how
to show 'em a good time,

18:45.844 --> 18:48.612
doesn't he?
Shh.

18:52.617 --> 18:54.552
( Mimicking baby crying )

18:54.586 --> 18:55.820
I'm up!
Jordan, it's ok!

18:55.854 --> 18:57.855
Mommy's coming.

18:57.889 --> 18:59.657
Oh, give it a rest,
super mom.

18:59.691 --> 19:01.492
Hi, Bonnie Wheeler,

19:01.526 --> 19:02.560
real mom,

19:02.594 --> 19:04.829
and my nondescript
sidekick.

19:04.863 --> 19:07.498
I'm sorry.
I guess I fell asleep.

19:07.532 --> 19:09.500
What's the dealio
with you?

19:09.534 --> 19:11.602
Why are you trying to make
the rest of us look bad?

19:11.636 --> 19:13.938
I'm not. I'm just trying
to make everything perfect.

19:13.972 --> 19:15.940
How's that working
for you?

19:15.974 --> 19:17.675
Look, I've raised
two boys,

19:17.709 --> 19:18.843
and I'm here
to tell you that

19:18.877 --> 19:21.512
there is no such thing
as perfect.

19:21.546 --> 19:22.847
They might be small,

19:22.881 --> 19:25.516
but a baby can take
you down.

19:26.718 --> 19:28.619
Getting through the day
in one piece--

19:28.653 --> 19:30.821
that, my friend,
is job done.

19:30.856 --> 19:32.723
I know.
( Sighs )

19:32.757 --> 19:34.758
I'm sorry.
I don't know what I'm doing.

19:34.793 --> 19:37.862
I try and I try,
but all I want to do

19:37.896 --> 19:39.663
- is take a nap.
- Yeah, I know.

19:39.698 --> 19:41.699
A really really long nap.

19:42.767 --> 19:44.802
This kid is sucking
the life out of me.

19:44.836 --> 19:46.971
Oh, I feel you, lizzy.

19:47.005 --> 19:48.672
- Izzy.
- Whatever.

19:50.709 --> 19:52.510
Not that anybody
seems to care,

19:52.544 --> 19:54.678
but, um, where's Ben?

19:54.713 --> 19:57.581
Tucker:
<i>Help! Can anybody hear me?</i>

19:57.616 --> 19:59.650
<i>We're stuck</i>
<i>in the laundry room.</i>

20:02.787 --> 20:04.722
I guess one
of us should go.

20:04.756 --> 20:07.658
Tucker: Anyone! We're desperate!

20:07.692 --> 20:09.693
And I really need
to use the bathroom.

20:12.526 --> 20:14.060
We're saved!

20:14.326 --> 20:15.560
Izzy, it's not
how it looks.

20:15.844 --> 20:17.645
Looks like you're hiding
out in a laundry room

20:17.679 --> 20:19.880
drinking beer while your
friend is stuck in a vent.

20:21.616 --> 20:24.518
- Hey, Tuck.
- Oh hey, girl.

20:25.887 --> 20:27.788
Look, I'm sorry,

20:27.823 --> 20:30.624
but clearly Emma and I
aren't ready for your class.

20:30.659 --> 20:32.426
I just don't have it
together like you do.

20:32.461 --> 20:34.695
She passed out
on your couch.

20:34.729 --> 20:36.597
Thanks.

20:36.631 --> 20:39.767
I kinda owe you
an apology.

20:39.801 --> 20:41.702
I just wanted a night off
with a cool guy.

20:41.736 --> 20:43.604
I didn't know
how else to do it.

20:43.638 --> 20:45.639
So the approval process?

20:45.674 --> 20:46.907
Don't really have one.

20:46.942 --> 20:49.710
What a coincidence--
neither do I.

20:49.744 --> 20:51.612
( Laughing )

20:51.646 --> 20:53.514
So maybe
we can start over.

20:53.548 --> 20:55.683
I would like that
very much.

20:55.717 --> 20:57.718
- Chip?
- Aw yes. Starving.

20:57.752 --> 20:59.687
- Who's winning?
- Hey, can I get a beer?

20:59.721 --> 21:01.856
- Yeah, here.
- Thanks.

21:01.890 --> 21:02.857
Mm, yeah.

21:02.891 --> 21:04.592
Tucker:
Still here.

21:04.626 --> 21:06.660
A little help
here, please. Okay.

21:06.695 --> 21:09.497
Oh yeah!
<i>Oh. ( Chuckles )</i>

21:09.531 --> 21:13.467
<i>Okay. Don't act like</i>
<i>y'all can't hear me.</i>

21:13.502 --> 21:15.803
Hey, I made that dip!

21:16.303 --> 21:20.742
