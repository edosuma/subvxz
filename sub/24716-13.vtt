NARRATOR:<i> Previously on </i>NYPD Blue.

00:02.502 --> 00:03.753
I’m Steve McClintock.

00:03.837 --> 00:05.171
Where were you last night
till this morning?

00:05.296 --> 00:06.381
I... I was with my girlfriend.

00:06.506 --> 00:08.550
Carly Landis, where was Steve last night?

00:08.675 --> 00:11.177
-With me. Why?
-That’s when Tina Most was murdered.

00:11.302 --> 00:13.054
Why are you lying for the guy who did it?

00:13.138 --> 00:16.016
He said that if I said anything,
he would kill me.

00:16.141 --> 00:17.434
I’m scared to be alone right now.

00:17.976 --> 00:19.519
Maybe I’ll stick around
for a little while.

00:19.769 --> 00:22.772
I figured you wanna know the judge
excluded Carly Landis’ statement.

00:22.897 --> 00:24.441
I thought you said the motion
was a long shot.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.276
It was till it came out to open court

00:26.359 --> 00:28.194
that your partner slept
with the defendant’s girlfriend.

00:28.319 --> 00:29.821
You should think about
selling real estate.

00:29.946 --> 00:31.614
Pretend we’re a team and see how you do.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.825
We’re going to be putting you
into a rotation of A.A. meetings

00:33.908 --> 00:36.327
in lower Manhattan.
The object is to draw our guy out

00:36.453 --> 00:39.748
and have him approach one of you
the same way he approached his victims.

00:39.914 --> 00:42.167
We’re dealing with somebody
who is turned on by weakness.

00:42.333 --> 00:46.796
He approaches his victims after a meeting
and finds a way of enticing them to drink.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.548
Once he gets them loaded, he kills them.

00:58.266 --> 01:00.477
I feel like all I do
is come in here and whine.

01:01.019 --> 01:03.271
My sponsor gave me a list of things to do.

01:04.689 --> 01:06.357
And I didn’t do them,
and I guess she got tired

01:06.441 --> 01:11.279
of hearing excuses for not doing it,
so she fired me. And, uh, I start in.

01:11.613 --> 01:13.656
"You know she’s wrong
she should’ve stuck with me."

01:14.282 --> 01:16.367
I got three and a half weeks
without a drink or a drug,

01:16.743 --> 01:17.786
and I’m flunking out.

01:19.120 --> 01:23.083
I keep waiting for it to get better,
and it doesn’t.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.752
I’m alone except for
when I’m at a meeting.

01:27.879 --> 01:28.922
And I’m lonely.

01:32.801 --> 01:35.178
-God, I’m lonely.
-(BELL DINGS)

01:35.553 --> 01:39.349

I, uh, guess I’m supposed to stop now.

01:39.557 --> 01:45.814
Thank you. We’ll take a 15-minute break.
Please, no smoking on the church grounds.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.733
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

01:49.025 --> 01:51.111
Thank you so much for sharing.

01:51.402 --> 01:53.905
-Oh, you’re welcome.
-You have such honesty.

01:54.030 --> 01:55.031
Thank you.

01:55.198 --> 01:57.575
Uh, do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

01:58.034 --> 01:59.410
It’s all pretty personal in here.

02:00.203 --> 02:03.832
-Is that your hair’s natural color?
-Uh-huh. (CHUCKLES)

02:04.040 --> 02:07.085
-Would you consider selling it?
-Selling my hair?

02:07.252 --> 02:12.006
I wholesale hair to wigmakers,
and your hair is the shade and texture

02:12.090 --> 02:14.050
-that... that I’m currently looking for.
-RITA: Oh.

02:14.175 --> 02:18.304
And it would be an opportunity for you
to earn and get your foot in the door.

02:18.596 --> 02:20.014
I don’t want to sell my hair.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.767
Do you want to hear
the going rate for hair like yours?

02:23.601 --> 02:27.313
-Kind of attached to it.
-(CHUCKLES) That’s good.

02:28.064 --> 02:30.608
-Will you think about it?
-I will.

02:31.025 --> 02:32.944
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

02:33.236 --> 02:36.906
-You heard of "H.A.L.T."?
-No. What is that?

02:38.116 --> 02:42.203
Hungry, angry, lonely, tired.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.581
Any one of those
is when you’re most at risk of drinking.

02:44.956 --> 02:47.667
Right now, I guess I could
check the box, next to all four.

02:48.042 --> 02:49.794
After the meeting,
do you want to get some breakfast?

02:49.878 --> 02:52.338
-Cross at least one off your list.
-Okay.

02:53.923 --> 02:57.051
-You don’t have a sponsor?
-Um, it might just be temporary.

02:57.385 --> 02:59.888
-But you don’t have a sponsor now?
-No.

03:00.805 --> 03:03.099
-I’ll be your sponsor.
-Um...

03:03.183 --> 03:06.060
That’s okay.
We’ll, uh, we’ll do it another time.

03:07.395 --> 03:08.646
(CLEARS THROAT)

03:09.147 --> 03:11.608
-Okay.
-Then after the meeting we’ll go out.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.276
Uh. Well, I’ve gotta get to work.

03:13.902 --> 03:16.529
Well, this is my card.
I want you to call me.

03:16.696 --> 03:19.490
-When’s the next meeting you’re going to?
-Oh, I’m not sure.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.284
-Do you have a schedule?
-Yeah.

03:21.451 --> 03:22.911
(CLEARS THROAT) Yeah.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.621
Well, I... I’m at this meeting
every Tuesday morning.

03:24.746 --> 03:27.123
Thursdays I’m at the 8 A.M.,
79th street workshop.

03:27.415 --> 03:29.167
-Call me.
-I will.

03:29.417 --> 03:30.710
I’ll be there in 15 minutes.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.088
(CLEARS THROAT)
Could you excuse me a second?

03:34.422 --> 03:35.965
-Sure.
-Thanks.

-Name’s Maya Heath.
-Strangled?

04:59.590 --> 05:01.217
Yeah, with lipstick smudged.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.386
-Who called it in?
-The sister.

05:03.636 --> 05:06.014
She called, got no answer,
decided to come by.

05:06.180 --> 05:08.266
-Where’s the sister now?
-In the other room.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

05:17.984 --> 05:20.862
I’m Detective Sipowicz.
He is Detective Clark.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.407
I know this is a bad time,
but we really need to ask you

05:24.490 --> 05:26.075
-a couple of questions.
-Okay?

05:26.284 --> 05:28.161
When’s the last time
you spoke with your sister?

05:28.453 --> 05:31.039
Last night. Uh, I called her
when I got back from work

05:31.122 --> 05:32.999
to see what she was doing,
and she said that

05:33.124 --> 05:34.667
she was on her way out to a meeting.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.586
Do you know what time it was
you were speaking to her?

05:37.003 --> 05:38.755
6:30, quarter to 7:00.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.841
So if she was on her way,
that’d be what, a seven o'clock meeting?

05:42.050 --> 05:43.051
I don’t know.

05:43.301 --> 05:46.763
-She tell you where the meeting was?
-Yeah. She said it was in a school.

05:46.888 --> 05:49.640
Your sister ever talk to you about people
she met at those meetings?

05:49.766 --> 05:53.227
Yes, she said she met some nice people,
she said she met some weird people.

05:53.686 --> 05:56.689
-She didn’t go into specifics.
-How long had she been going to meetings?

05:57.357 --> 06:01.778
Three weeks, something like that.
I know it was less than a month

06:01.903 --> 06:04.572
because a month ago,
she had gone to Atlanta on business

06:04.655 --> 06:06.032
and wound up getting fired.

06:06.491 --> 06:09.327
-For drinking?
-Yeah, drinking, missing appointments,

06:09.702 --> 06:12.330
just generally making a mess of things.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.624
Do you know if your sister
kept a diary of some kind?

06:14.874 --> 06:15.958
I know she used to.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.752
Do you know where
we might be able to find it?

06:17.835 --> 06:21.130
It was in her computer.
It’s under "Martha."

06:21.506 --> 06:23.007
That was our dog when we were little.

06:23.716 --> 06:25.760
All right, thank you very much
for your help. (SIGHS)

06:25.927 --> 06:27.720
When we know something,
we’ll get in touch with you.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.389
When she got back from Atlanta,

06:29.597 --> 06:32.100
I told her that she was a candidate
to wind up homeless

06:32.266 --> 06:34.435
if she didn’t do something
about her drinking.

06:34.685 --> 06:38.272
It hurt her that I would say that.
It hurt her that I was mad at her,

06:38.356 --> 06:39.649
and she couldn’t stand that.

06:40.691 --> 06:42.860
She started going to meetings
and she wound up dead.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.946
You can’t blame yourself for that.

06:45.655 --> 06:46.781
I can’t, huh?

06:57.834 --> 07:00.378
-Fit the pattern?
-Like a glove.

07:00.628 --> 07:02.088
We have any idea which meeting she was at?

07:02.213 --> 07:04.340
We know roughly what time it was
and that it was at a school,

07:04.465 --> 07:05.633
hope it get narrows about.

07:05.883 --> 07:07.385
-Signs he got her to drink?
-Yeah.

07:07.593 --> 07:10.346
Uh, we might also allow
for the possibility that it’s not a "He."

07:10.555 --> 07:12.765
Female victim, strangulation.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.560
This woman that approached me this morning
could strangle somebody.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.812
-She coming on to you?
-I’d say she plays for the other team.

07:18.146 --> 07:20.314
Whether she was reaching out to help me
or she had something else in mind,

07:20.440 --> 07:21.315
that I don’t know.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.775
Is there some other way
you can check her out?

07:22.859 --> 07:24.610
Yeah, she gave me a business card.

07:24.819 --> 07:27.572
Given that he or she got the
D.O.A. to drink before he killed her,

07:27.697 --> 07:30.491
-we should canvas nearby bars.
-D.O.A. wouldn’t be drinking in a bar.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.286
-And why is that?
-She would've been too ashamed.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.371
If she was gonna drink,
she’d do it privately.

07:35.496 --> 07:38.583
Yeah, if it turns out we were covering
one of the meetings that she went to,

07:38.708 --> 07:40.585
we’ll have videotapes of people
who were going there.

07:40.668 --> 07:42.879
Well, whoever it is waited a month
between the first two,

07:43.212 --> 07:45.965
three weeks between the second and third,
and one week before this one.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.758
We need to step it up,
get him to go again.

07:47.884 --> 07:50.761
I got a call about a homicide
at 13th and third. Male, stabbed.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.346
-Who’s up?
-I am.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.432
I don’t want to take Sipowicz
off the task force.

07:54.515 --> 07:55.641
Clark, you partner up with Jones.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.768
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)
-Medavoy, you work with Sipowicz.

08:07.528 --> 08:10.573
Looks like a burglary gone bad.
Guy busted in the window,

08:10.698 --> 08:14.452
surprised the D.O.A.,
then it’s stab, steal, <i>Hasta la vista.</i>

08:14.535 --> 08:16.120
Well, he’s got the
whole thing figured out.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.622
I’m just trying to tell you what I see.

08:17.705 --> 08:20.291
Yeah, maybe we’ll take a look, too,
just for the heck of it.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.627
-You get a name of the D.O.A.?
-Steve McClintock.

08:22.835 --> 08:23.920
You’re kidding.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.172
That’s what the neighbor says.
Matches the name on the mailbox.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.925
-BALDWIN: Well, who called it in?
-Downstairs neighbor.

08:29.133 --> 08:31.010
She heard the fight, didn’t see anything.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.887
Said it happened a little before
8:00 this morning.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.806
-I’ll be damned.
-McClintock, huh?

08:36.516 --> 08:38.392
He was involved
in that adoption scam, right?

08:38.726 --> 08:40.186
Yeah, he killed one of the pregnant girls.

08:40.728 --> 08:43.814
(CLEARS THROAT) We, uh, got him
but the case was thrown out.

08:46.275 --> 08:49.403
There’s some money here.
whatever they were after, it wasn’t cash.

08:49.862 --> 08:53.241
Hey. We got something here.
Down there.

-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

08:58.704 --> 09:00.915
-What is this, some kind of drug?
-Good job.

09:01.874 --> 09:04.669
McClintock,uh, he had a girlfriend, right?

09:05.795 --> 09:07.171
Name’s Carly Landis.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.174
Yeah, well, we should talk to her.

09:11.676 --> 09:12.760
Yeah, we should.

09:25.773 --> 09:26.816
Have a seat, Carly.

09:29.110 --> 09:31.821
-Where were you around 8:00 this morning?
-You want to tell me what this is about?

09:31.904 --> 09:33.155
Just answer the question.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.784
I think I have a right to know
why I’m here.

09:36.867 --> 09:39.245
Just answer a few questions
and we’ll tell you.

09:39.745 --> 09:43.457
I was helping a woman named Rhoda Weiss.
I’m her home healthcare worker.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.960
I got to her apartment
a little before 7:00.

09:46.168 --> 09:48.462
-And left around 10:00.
-I thought you worked at a clinic.

09:48.879 --> 09:50.506
I got fired when Steve was arrested.

09:50.590 --> 09:54.010
-You still with Steve?
-That also ended when he got arrested.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.177
Why’d you break up with him?

09:55.303 --> 09:57.138
Finding out
that he killed somebody, for one.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.515
And two, because he threatened me
with a gun and he hit me.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.892
-Other than that, really great guy.
-When’s the last time you saw him?

10:02.685 --> 10:05.104
-About a month ago.
-And you haven’t talked to him since then?

10:05.187 --> 10:08.858
No. What’s he done?
I assume he’s the reason I’m here.

10:10.484 --> 10:11.694
He was killed this morning.

10:12.486 --> 10:13.487
Really?

10:14.155 --> 10:15.781
You don’t sound too broken up about it.

10:15.865 --> 10:18.326
The last time I saw Steve,
he gave me a black eye

10:18.576 --> 10:19.869
and he split my lower lip. So, no.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.079
Do you know anybody
who’d want to kill him?

10:22.538 --> 10:25.249
Oh, Steve ripped off so many people.
Have you talked to any of them?

10:25.333 --> 10:26.709
Do you know if he was in any trouble?

10:27.043 --> 10:30.421
I know he needed money.
He couldn’t find a job after the arrest.

10:30.588 --> 10:33.633
He used to tell me that he paid his way
through college dealing pharmaceuticals.

10:33.716 --> 10:36.135
-Maybe he started that up again.
-He used drugs himself?

10:36.302 --> 10:37.303
No, not that I ever saw.

10:38.220 --> 10:42.975
Look, I am working to forget everything
that I ever knew about Steve.

10:43.392 --> 10:46.228
Whatever it is that you’re trying
to find out, I can’t help you.

10:46.562 --> 10:48.814
-You’re sure about that?
-Yes, John, I am.

The number of the woman
you were with this morning.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.869
(SIGHS)

11:03.120 --> 11:04.830
Can I speak to you
for a second in private?

11:13.673 --> 11:16.509
-What do you want to talk about?
-I understand that you’re angry at me.

11:16.926 --> 11:20.596
I guess I can’t blame you for that,
but I just want you to know

11:20.888 --> 11:26.686
that what happened between us that night
was genuine. At least it was for me.

11:27.395 --> 11:30.523
And your boyfriend getting sprung
on account of it, that was coincidence?

11:30.606 --> 11:33.317
No, I told a friend about you,
word got back to Steve.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.986
-I swear, I didn’t tell him anything.
-You expect me to believe that?

11:36.153 --> 11:38.489
His lawyer came to me
and said that I had to help Steve out.

11:38.614 --> 11:40.783
She made it very clear
that if I didn’t, I would get hurt.

11:41.826 --> 11:42.827
I believed her.

11:43.577 --> 11:45.996
I knew how violent he could get
when he was desperate.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.541
-Why didn’t you tell somebody?
-I was too scared.

11:48.666 --> 11:51.210
I think this is where I came in.
You told me how scared you were,

11:51.293 --> 11:52.753
how you needed someone
to take care of you.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.798
Which was true,
you don’t have to like me,

11:55.923 --> 11:59.677
but can you consider the possibility
that I’m not the person you think I am?

12:09.019 --> 12:10.771
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

12:12.481 --> 12:15.651
I just got the lab report on that stuff
you found in Steve McClintock’s apartment.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.445
-It was steroids.
-Really?

12:17.611 --> 12:20.030
Some high-end, state of the art stuff.
Was he a user?

12:20.281 --> 12:23.200
I don’t think so.
I mean, he was big, but not that big.

12:23.367 --> 12:25.911
Whatever you find out,
be sure to bring narcotics into the loop.

If you need to liaison with the feds,
just let me know.

-JOHN: Okay.
-BALDWIN: We dumped McClintock’s phone,

12:29.999 --> 12:32.126
there’s a bunch of calls made
to somebody named Darien Lasalle.

12:32.251 --> 12:33.794
-We’re gonna go talk to him.
-Good.

(TELEPHONE RINGING)

12:37.965 --> 12:39.216
Find anything in that diary?

12:39.508 --> 12:41.594
She mentions someone named Roger
from the meeting in school.

12:42.052 --> 12:44.180
Based on the time,
we figured out which meeting it was,

12:44.263 --> 12:47.266
got the phone list from that meeting,
and got the number for a Roger H.

12:47.391 --> 12:49.101
Comes back as being Roger Harborn.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.312
Two arrests for domestic violence
in five years.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.898

-Let me know after you talk to him.

-Yeah, that’s right.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.494
-Give us a minute?
-Sure, man.

13:06.827 --> 13:08.829
-Can we talk to you?
-Sure, what about?

13:09.371 --> 13:11.499
I am Detective Jones and Clark.
We’re investigating an incident

13:11.624 --> 13:13.709
that occurred this morning.
Where were you around eight o'clock?

13:13.834 --> 13:15.711
This morning? Right here.

13:16.170 --> 13:19.465
I handle all the personal training clients
between 6:00 a.m. and noon.

13:19.548 --> 13:21.258
You know what,
the guy at the front desk tells us

13:21.342 --> 13:22.927
you’re a competitive body builder.
Is that right?

13:23.010 --> 13:24.929
Yeah, I’ve been on the circuit
about three years now.

13:25.054 --> 13:28.098
-You know Steve McClintock?
-No, afraid not.

13:28.599 --> 13:29.642
No idea who he is?

13:30.893 --> 13:31.894
-No.
-Funny.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.814
'Cause you talked to him on the phone
for five minutes yesterday.

13:35.022 --> 13:38.192
Oh, Steve! (CHUCKLES)
Right. You know, it’s funny. Yeah.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.736
You know my head, I thought you were
talking about somebody else.

13:40.861 --> 13:43.072
-JOHN: Hmm.
-Yeah, uh, I talked to Steve.

13:43.322 --> 13:44.532
What did you talk about?

13:44.907 --> 13:48.661
You know, "Hello. How ya doin’.
What’s up?"

13:49.495 --> 13:51.831
-And that was it?
-Yeah, pretty much.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.165
You ever use steroids, Darien?

13:53.290 --> 13:58.045
No, man. No, I... I work clean.
I got the test results to prove it.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.089
So, you weren’t talking
to Steve McClintock about steroids.

14:00.214 --> 14:02.925
Shh. No, no. I stay away from that stuff.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.385
Darien, Steve was killed this morning.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.388
This is a homicide investigation,
so I want you to take a moment

14:07.471 --> 14:08.931
and think before you lie again.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.725
All right. Look,
I wasn’t lying to you guys.

14:11.976 --> 14:14.103
-Then you’re coming in.
-Hey! Wait... Guys, all right.

14:14.270 --> 14:17.314
Look man, I got the semis this weekend

14:17.439 --> 14:19.692
for the "Mr. Natural pro-power
Physique Olympiad."

14:20.067 --> 14:22.820
I mean, dude, if word of this gets out,
they’re gonna disqualify me.

14:22.903 --> 14:25.698
-I won’t be able to compete.
-What you need to focus on now is prison,

14:25.990 --> 14:27.658
because you are this close
to going inside.

14:29.326 --> 14:30.327
Okay.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.038
Word was out on the street
that Steve was selling "The Clear."

14:33.622 --> 14:36.500
-So I called him up.
-Wait, what’s... what's "The Clear"?

14:36.625 --> 14:38.836
It promotes muscle growth,
improves recovery,

14:39.003 --> 14:40.129
doesn’t show up on the tests.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.463
What did he say to you?

14:41.797 --> 14:44.758
He said he got a big shipment in.
We were gonna get together in a few days.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.595
-That was it?
-Yeah, that was it. I swear to you.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.263
I don’t know anything
about him getting killed.

14:49.638 --> 14:51.181
You know anyone else
who was buying from him?

14:52.099 --> 14:54.643
Well, no, not personally,
but you go into any gym,

14:54.727 --> 14:55.769
you might find somebody.

you can keep me out of this?

we’re talking about here.

is gonna shrink your balls, give you tits,

No, no. I’m okay.

-Right.

-How’d you find out about that?
-There was a robbery in the school.

We’re talking to everybody
who’s been on the premises.

15:38.896 --> 15:42.191
Okay. Well, I’ve been on the premises.

15:42.691 --> 15:44.234
Anyone in your group raise any flags?

15:44.985 --> 15:46.070
No.

15:46.195 --> 15:49.406
-How about a girl named Maya Heath?
-How about her?

-We’re covering all angles.

-Yeah.

-When’s the last time you saw her?
-Uh, last time was the meeting.

-Which was when?
-Last week.

-Where were you last night, Roger?

I had... had to work late.

you sell copy machines.

16:10.427 --> 16:11.929
-Well, I do.
-What do you have to do late?

16:12.054 --> 16:15.265

let me in during business hours,

-and I gotta go late.
-GREG: That doesn’t ring true, Roger.

-No. (CHUCKLES) No, no, I wasn’t.

-I didn’t go to the meeting.

have a different conversation.

he was moving some drugs.

They picked up a guy named Nathan Creek.
Carrying a couple hundred doses

17:58.118 --> 18:00.287
of that steroid we found
in McClintock’s this morning.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.372
-Who’s Creek?
-A drug dealer.

18:02.706 --> 18:04.583
He’s also got a burglary
and assault on his sheet.

18:04.708 --> 18:05.834
When they pick him up?

18:05.959 --> 18:08.629
About an hour after McClintock got killed.
He’s at the Tombs.

18:16.261 --> 18:19.223
-Where’d you get the steroids, Nathan?
-Don’t know what you’re talking about.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.892
A couple hundred glass vials
that were in the trunk of your car.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.227
Don’t know anything about that.

18:23.310 --> 18:25.979
We found fingerprints on them
that belong to a Steve McClintock.

18:26.563 --> 18:27.564
He was stabbed this morning.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.566
Is any of this
starting to ring a bell to you?

18:30.234 --> 18:31.318
No.

18:31.693 --> 18:33.821
Must’ve been the guy who killed him
and put that dope in my car.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.614
BALDWIN: Nathan,
I don’t think you appreciate

18:35.739 --> 18:36.949
how thoroughly screwed you are.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.284
We’re gonna find your prints
in McClintock’s apartment.

18:39.576 --> 18:41.495
We’re gonna find his blood
on your clothes and we’re gonna

18:41.578 --> 18:44.373
find the knife you killed him with,
if we gotta go through every garbage can

18:44.456 --> 18:46.542
South of 42nd street and the game’s over.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.293
Do yourself a favor
and tell us what happened.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.796
This is a felony murder
that buys you the death penalty.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.757
Unless there were circumstances
that you want to explain.

18:56.218 --> 18:59.638
Would circumstances include
someone else coming up

18:59.721 --> 19:01.265
with the idea of me going in?

19:01.348 --> 19:03.809
-Maybe. Who?
-This chick.

19:04.351 --> 19:06.061
She told me this McClintock guy

19:06.186 --> 19:08.021
had this shipment of steroids
in his apartment, right?

19:08.730 --> 19:10.858
I was just gonna go in and grab them.
She was gonna sell them.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.068
We were gonna split the take, right?
Simple.

19:13.193 --> 19:16.405
Except she also said that this guy
was gonna be out of his apartment

19:16.488 --> 19:18.407
all morning. Which he wasn’t.

19:18.866 --> 19:21.869
-This chick got a name?
-Carly Landis.

19:22.870 --> 19:25.164
-She put you up to this?
-Laid out the whole thing.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.875
-And how do you know her?
-She worked at a free clinic

19:27.958 --> 19:30.377
down on Rivington I used to go to.
We’ve stayed in touch.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.963
She say why she wanted
to rip this McClintock guy off?

19:33.088 --> 19:35.340
No, only that it would be easy
and the money would be good.

19:35.716 --> 19:38.135
-She didn’t say more than that?
-That was enough for me, you know.

19:38.218 --> 19:39.636
BALDWIN: So you went into the apartment,

19:39.720 --> 19:41.638
and found McClintock there,
and you stabbed him, right?

19:41.763 --> 19:44.933
Found? Found? What?
I mean, he came at me like a bull.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.311
If I hadn’t done him,
he sure as hell would have done me.

19:47.936 --> 19:51.648
I mean, I... I can argue that.
I mean that’s like... that's self-defense.

19:52.107 --> 19:53.275
That’s legit, right?

19:53.734 --> 19:55.903
What, did you were defending yourself
while you were breaking

19:55.986 --> 19:57.196
into his apartment and robbing him?

19:57.321 --> 19:59.656
Yeah. That’s right.
That’s exactly what I was doing.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.626
-CARLY: He’s lying.
-Oh, come on, Carly.

20:10.751 --> 20:13.003
Yes, I know Nathan Creek
from the Rivington Clinic.

20:13.086 --> 20:14.254
He came in a couple of times.

20:14.338 --> 20:17.549
No, we did not keep in touch.
He basically stalked me.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.469
It was so bad that I nearly
had to get a restraining order.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.387
The guy is a violent psychotic.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.181
It sounds exactly like
what you were looking for.

20:24.264 --> 20:26.975
I wasn’t looking for anything
and I haven’t seen

20:27.100 --> 20:30.187
or talked to Nathan Creek
in six months, thank god.

20:30.270 --> 20:32.105
That’s a pretty big coincidence,
don't you think?

20:32.314 --> 20:34.566
Creek just happens to bust
into your ex-boyfriend’s apartment?

20:34.691 --> 20:36.985
Steve knew a lot of bad people.
For all I know,

20:37.110 --> 20:38.528
he and Nathan were working together.

20:38.612 --> 20:40.155
Why did Creek say this was your idea?

20:40.239 --> 20:42.908
Maybe because he’s up for murder
and he’d say anything to pass the blame?

20:42.991 --> 20:45.827
See, you didn’t want the steroids
you sent Creek to the apartment

20:45.911 --> 20:47.162
because you wanted Steve dead.

20:47.412 --> 20:48.956
-No, I didn’t.
-Why, because he dumped you?

20:49.081 --> 20:52.084
No. And I told you, I left him.
Creek’s lying.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.044
And I’m sure
that it is not the first time.

20:54.127 --> 20:55.921
BALDWIN: If he’s telling the truth,
we’re gonna find out,

20:56.046 --> 20:57.422
so it’s better if you tell us now.

20:57.589 --> 21:01.343
There is nothing to tell.
You aren’t going to find anything.

21:04.221 --> 21:06.682
(CLICKS TONGUE) Do you have anything
on her besides Creek’s statement?

21:06.974 --> 21:08.976
-No.
-She have an alibi?

21:09.268 --> 21:11.270
Yeah, Sally, the woman she was with,
confirmed it.

21:11.561 --> 21:12.813
Then there’s nothing I can do.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.482
Or we just want to hold her for few days
while we do some digging.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.651
If I try and indict her
without corroboration,

21:17.776 --> 21:19.361
my boss will laugh me out of the office.

21:19.611 --> 21:22.739
Nathan Creek is a convicted drug dealer
and a repeat felon.

21:22.948 --> 21:24.324
Carly Landis is a nurse.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.868

wins that credibility contest?

21:27.661 --> 21:29.955
-We’ll keep looking.
-Do that.

21:30.122 --> 21:33.750
And get me something solid
before you call me down here again, okay?

21:44.177 --> 21:47.014
So, Carly tells Nathan Creek
that McClintock won’t be in his apartment

21:47.097 --> 21:49.474
that morning, but she wants
McClintock dead.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.769
So you’ve gotta figure
she knows he’ll be there that morning.

21:53.061 --> 21:54.646
-Yeah.
-But how’d she know that?

21:54.896 --> 21:56.690
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)
-Good question.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.569
(SIGHS)

22:01.069 --> 22:03.822
-Any progress remembering their names?
-I’m not sure.

22:03.905 --> 22:09.745
Uh, I’m remembering making sales calls,
but, I’m not remembering when.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.039
What about Maya?
You remembering anything about her?

22:12.748 --> 22:16.168
-I liked her. I wanted to go out with her.
-She feel the same way?

22:16.501 --> 22:20.547
No. She said that she wasn’t
ready to be dating anyone.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.632
She had issues with men,
whatever that means.

22:23.050 --> 22:25.677
Maybe I just wasn’t her type. Who knows?

22:26.386 --> 22:28.430
What’d you do
after she told you that, Roger?

22:29.222 --> 22:30.807
-I don’t know.
-What do you mean you don’t know?

22:31.224 --> 22:34.186
I mean I don’t know.
We were in a Chinese restaurant,

22:34.936 --> 22:36.438
it was after a meeting and...

22:39.608 --> 22:41.651
-I don’t know what I did.
-What meeting was it?

22:42.861 --> 22:44.571
The one on West Houston Street at noon.

22:45.322 --> 22:48.617
I saw her at the meeting,
and I asked her to have lunch.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.911
I... I remember being at the restaurant...

22:52.788 --> 22:55.874
seeing the other people drinking these
big bottles of Chinese beer.

22:57.376 --> 23:00.212
I remember waiting
and I remember that at a certain point

23:00.295 --> 23:03.215
I said to the waiter, "Bring me one."

23:03.924 --> 23:06.676
-What about Maya? Did she have one?
-No. I don’t think so.

23:06.968 --> 23:08.845
I think she got mad at me
for ordering one.

23:10.347 --> 23:11.807
And I think she left.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.934
What’s the next thing
you remember after the beer?

23:14.810 --> 23:17.437
Getting woken up in my car
by a state trooper.

23:17.854 --> 23:19.856
-Where was that?
-Off the Southern State.

23:20.065 --> 23:21.817
-He write you up?
-No, sir.

23:22.234 --> 23:26.113
He did a field sobriety test on me,
but my head had cleared by then.

23:26.738 --> 23:29.533
You don’t know what happened
between the time you ordered the beer

23:29.616 --> 23:31.076
and when the state trooper woke you up?

23:32.327 --> 23:35.372
The reason I got myself to start
going to these meetings was because...

23:35.914 --> 23:40.127
(SNIFFLES) When I got drunk, there was
no telling what I was capable of.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.754
I’ve been abusive. I’ve been violent.

23:43.130 --> 23:45.215
If you tell me I killed Maya,
I won’t argue with you.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.510
I’m so sorry.

24:03.733 --> 24:06.778
This was just sent over for you.
I... I think it’s from Bridget.

24:06.903 --> 24:10.365
Oh. Oh, man.
Is she’s sending you presents now?

24:10.532 --> 24:13.660
-My man.
-What’s the note say, Greggy?

24:14.995 --> 24:17.497
"To celebrate
and so you don’t catch cold."

24:17.873 --> 24:20.500
-Well, that’s nice.
-Yeah, I... I helped her close a sale,

24:20.625 --> 24:21.668
so that’s why.

24:21.751 --> 24:23.920
-That’s not why.
-She likes you.

24:24.004 --> 24:25.005
Mm-hmm.

24:25.589 --> 24:27.382
Where are we with the McClintock homicide?

24:27.507 --> 24:29.259
Well, it looks like
this Carly Landis set it up.

24:29.384 --> 24:32.220
She sent this guy Creek to the apartment
allegedly to steal drugs,

24:32.304 --> 24:33.722
knowing that this McClintock
would be there.

24:34.055 --> 24:36.308
-Unfortunately, we can’t prove that.
-THOMAS: So what are you doing?

24:37.017 --> 24:39.519
Continuing to work our way
through McClintock’s phone records.

24:39.728 --> 24:42.689
There’s a Henry Delgado we have to talk to
just want a way over his work.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.191
Don’t let me stop you.

24:50.947 --> 24:53.033
-Where do we stand?
-The State Police confirm

24:53.116 --> 24:55.202
that the stop was made
around six this morning

24:55.368 --> 24:57.871
and the Chinese restaurant confirms
that he was in there

24:57.996 --> 25:00.707
-yesterday afternoon and he was drinking.
-Was the girl in there with him?

25:00.832 --> 25:02.334
The waiter says
that she walked out on him.

25:02.417 --> 25:04.628
-Which is what he said.
-Still leaves up in the possibility

25:04.794 --> 25:05.879
he went to her apartment.

25:05.962 --> 25:08.673
He’s a blackout drunk, if he did it,
he wouldn’t have been this careful

25:08.757 --> 25:11.218
-to cover his tracks.
-Either of you run into this guy?

25:11.510 --> 25:13.178
He introduced himself to me
before a meeting.

25:13.261 --> 25:14.513
I think he was
just being friendly, though.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.056
Hold him.

25:16.556 --> 25:19.059
-He’s not the guy, boss.
-He was the last person seen with her.

25:19.226 --> 25:21.436
He can’t account for his whereabouts
at the time she was killed.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.105
All the more reason.
If he did it, he’d have a story.

25:24.231 --> 25:25.732
You feel something
for this guy, Detective?

25:26.566 --> 25:27.734
That has nothing to do with it.

25:27.817 --> 25:30.946
Until you have a better suspect in hand,
I want him held.

25:41.039 --> 25:44.084
So the phone’s in your name,
but the apartment’s rented

25:44.167 --> 25:45.835
to a Camille Del Gado, who’s that?

25:46.002 --> 25:48.547
-My mother. She’s been there for years.
-(TOOLS CLANKING)

25:48.838 --> 25:51.007
I moved in about a year ago,
got my own phone.

25:51.132 --> 25:52.300
Why’d you move in?

25:52.425 --> 25:55.679
My mom’s pretty sick. High blood-pressure,
congested heart failure.

25:55.887 --> 25:56.930
I’m taking care of her.

We’re investigating a crime
involving a Steve McClintock.

25:59.140 --> 26:01.601
Now going through his phone records,
we found a call to him

26:01.685 --> 26:03.019
made from your phone three days ago.

26:03.603 --> 26:05.480
I was looking for another
home healthcare worker.

26:05.939 --> 26:09.067
A... a service recommended
Mr. McClintock to me, he wasn’t available.

26:09.150 --> 26:11.486
Mr. McClintock was an OB/GYN nurse.

26:11.611 --> 26:14.281
What service recommended him
to work with an elderly woman?

26:14.489 --> 26:15.615
The particular service?

26:15.782 --> 26:18.243
Yeah. Maybe you can dig up
the name for us.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.203
I mean, I can try. I... I don’t know.

26:20.453 --> 26:22.956
Right now, you said you needed another
home healthcare worker,

26:23.540 --> 26:24.791
you already have somebody coming in?

26:25.000 --> 26:27.544
-Yeah, couple times a week.
-Who’s that?

26:28.169 --> 26:29.713
A woman named Carly Landis.

26:30.797 --> 26:32.841
Did she get you to call Steve McClintock
and set up a meeting

26:32.924 --> 26:34.342
-in his apartment this morning?
-No.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.761
All right, Henry,
this is a homicide investigation,

26:36.845 --> 26:39.639
you are an accessory
to the crime if you lie to us.

26:39.723 --> 26:42.684
I’m not lying.
I talked to McClintock about nursing care.

26:42.809 --> 26:44.519
Steve McClintock was stabbed to death.

26:44.644 --> 26:46.521
If you’re involved in any way,
you helped kill him.

26:46.896 --> 26:48.315
Now, you need to think
about that a minute.

26:50.191 --> 26:51.651
My mother needs a lot of medicine.

26:52.777 --> 26:55.196
Beta blockers, blood pressure,
cholesterol medication,

26:55.280 --> 26:57.407
even with Medicare
it’s more than I can afford.

26:58.575 --> 27:01.453
Carly Landis said she’d get me a supply
of cheap meds if I placed the call.

27:01.536 --> 27:02.996
What did she tell you to say to him?

27:03.371 --> 27:06.916
That I wanted a drug called "The Clear"
and that I would be at his apartment

27:07.000 --> 27:09.044
between 07:00 and 10:00 this morning.
That's all.

27:09.210 --> 27:11.671
-She say why she wanted you to do it?
-Something about McClintock

27:12.172 --> 27:14.341
owing her money.
I... I didn’t ask a lot of questions.

27:14.424 --> 27:15.592
It sounded like some sort of prank.

27:16.593 --> 27:19.304
-He... he really got killed?
-Yeah.

All these years going to bars,
I should’ve been going to meetings.

27:34.569 --> 27:36.279
That’s a stupid thing to say,
you know that?

27:36.613 --> 27:38.365
-Why?
-At least just pretend

27:38.448 --> 27:40.700
-that you’re taking it seriously.
-Come on, Andy.

27:40.825 --> 27:43.161
It’s not like I’m not taking it seriously.

-From where?

27:46.706 --> 27:48.875
-He was at the meeting this morning.
-He came over to talk to you

27:49.042 --> 27:50.627
-during the break.
-And he asked me out.

-Out, out?
-Out to get breakfast after the meeting.

she started talking to me,

27:55.965 --> 27:57.676
-and he backed off.
-What’d we find out about her?

she wasn’t living in New York

27:59.969 --> 28:01.304

-Oh, yeah. He definitely knew her.

31:44.819 --> 31:48.197
-The apartments are set up?
-Yeah, the dummy apartment is set up

31:48.323 --> 31:50.867
for the undercover to bring him to,
and we have the apartment

31:50.950 --> 31:52.952
-across the hall for backup.
-How much time do we have?

31:53.161 --> 31:55.163
Meeting’s in an hour.
Figure there’s a half-hour

31:55.288 --> 31:56.289
worth of conversation afterwards.

31:56.623 --> 31:58.166
Make the call as soon as you spot him.

31:58.374 --> 32:00.209
I don’t want to cut it
any closer than we have to.

32:00.460 --> 32:02.795
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)
-All right, guys. Good luck.

32:36.621 --> 32:37.664
GRACE: Meeting time.

32:38.539 --> 32:40.583
We’ll start the meeting
by going around the room

32:40.667 --> 32:42.043
and introducing ourselves.

32:43.086 --> 32:45.546
My name’s Grace. I’m an alcoholic.

32:45.672 --> 32:46.756
ALL: Hi, Grace.

32:47.090 --> 32:49.968
-WARREN: Warren, alcoholic.
-ALL: Hi, Warren.

32:50.259 --> 32:53.763
-George. Addict, alcoholic.
-ALL: Hi, George.

32:53.972 --> 32:57.558
-Justin, alcoholic.
-ALL: Hi, Justin.

32:57.892 --> 33:01.437
-MELINDA: I’m Melinda. I’m an alcoholic.
-ALL: Hi, Melinda.

33:02.230 --> 33:04.816
-Elaine, alcoholic.
-ALL: Hi, Elaine.

33:05.358 --> 33:09.237
-Hi, I’m Jack. I’m an addict, alcoholic.
-ALL: Hi, Jack.

33:19.622 --> 33:21.457
I always knew
how to get attention from men.

33:22.125 --> 33:24.460
If the guy had one shot of tequila,
I had three.

33:25.586 --> 33:27.797
If he did two lines of coke,
I did half a gram.

33:28.589 --> 33:31.718
Laura does not party like a chick,
she parties like a guy.

33:33.219 --> 33:35.054
Laura also sleeps around like a guy.

33:36.514 --> 33:39.892
Which is why five years ago,
Laura had a kid

33:40.059 --> 33:44.814
who’s now somewhere in the world
being raised by somebody else.

33:46.733 --> 33:48.151
Today’s her birthday. (SIGHS)

33:49.902 --> 33:51.112
Thanks for letting me share.

(CAR ENGINE REVVING)

34:04.250 --> 34:06.294
Did you want go off
with the others and get something to eat?

34:07.295 --> 34:08.671
I’m not really in the mood.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.132
JUSTIN: <i>You all right?</i>
<i>you want to talk about it?</i>

34:12.717 --> 34:13.718
LAURA: <i>Sure.</i>

34:14.719 --> 34:17.430
(SIGHS) Some days I’m better about things.

34:17.555 --> 34:19.599
-(CHUCKLES)
-Days like today, I just...

34:20.349 --> 34:25.730
I look at the mess I made of my life,
and I can’t imagine how I’m surviving.

34:26.439 --> 34:29.275
Sometimes I don’t really think
I even deserve to survive.

34:29.525 --> 34:32.779
If we only got what we deserved,
most of us would be long dead.

-(POLICE SIREN WAILING)
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER P.A.)

34:34.781 --> 34:36.783
-I know.
-You go to meetings?

34:37.533 --> 34:38.576
Yep.

34:38.659 --> 34:41.454
-You got people you can call?
-Yep.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.664
-(CHUCKLES SLIGHTLY)
-Do you call them?

34:44.624 --> 34:46.250
No. (CHUCKLES)

34:47.210 --> 34:49.003
You’re thinking about
getting loaded, aren’t you?

34:49.128 --> 34:51.089
(SIGHS) All the time.

34:52.423 --> 34:55.843
-Maybe that’s what you gotta do then.
-You’re saying I should drink?

34:55.968 --> 35:00.056
<i>I’m saying, you fight it</i>
<i>as long and as hard as you can fight it,</i>

35:00.223 --> 35:02.683
<i>and then at a certain point,</i>
<i>you can’t fight it anymore.</i>

35:02.767 --> 35:03.935
Asshole.

35:04.185 --> 35:05.436
-It’s him, right?
-Yeah.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.063
I’ll let them know
to get ready at the apartment.

35:07.522 --> 35:09.774
That kind of goes against
what most people say, doesn’t it?

35:09.857 --> 35:12.401
Yeah well, a lot of people
are pretty good at making up rules

35:12.527 --> 35:13.778
for other people to live by.

35:15.029 --> 35:16.239
I don’t do that.

35:17.073 --> 35:18.449
In the past...

35:19.867 --> 35:23.412
when I drank or used, I got into trouble.

35:24.330 --> 35:27.667
If you want me to, I’ll stay with you.

35:29.085 --> 35:30.336
Make sure that doesn’t happen.

35:30.461 --> 35:33.256
-I’m not gonna ask you to babysit me.
-What are we talking about here?

35:33.381 --> 35:37.593
Having a drink, take the edge off,
see, maybe you can do it.

35:38.553 --> 35:40.138
<i>Hell, maybe you’re not an alcoholic.</i>

35:55.319 --> 35:57.864
(GULPS) Oh.

35:58.573 --> 36:00.741
(CHUCKLES) Aren’t you gonna have one?

36:01.701 --> 36:02.743
Sure.

36:05.246 --> 36:06.539
LAURA: Whoo! (SIGHS)

36:10.376 --> 36:14.338
-You have no idea how good that feels.
-It frees you up, right?

36:14.839 --> 36:17.383
-What do you mean?
-Well, you lose inhibition.

36:17.925 --> 36:19.635
I thought you were here
to keep me out of trouble.

36:19.760 --> 36:22.346
I’m just saying that’s the effect.

36:22.555 --> 36:24.932
I know it’s had that effect in the past.

36:25.141 --> 36:28.978
And then it helps you feel not quite
so ashamed of yourself afterward.

36:29.854 --> 36:30.897
Ah. Right.

36:31.689 --> 36:32.899
Have another one.

36:34.650 --> 36:37.195
-(SIGHS) Okay. (CHUCKLES)
-(CHUCKLES)

36:37.403 --> 36:41.324
On the one hand,
you put on this respectable front.

36:42.200 --> 36:45.119
You’re well-groomed, you dress modestly,

36:45.411 --> 36:48.122
you even seem to care
about this kid you gave up.

36:48.497 --> 36:50.291
-I do care about her.
-I know you do.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.210
My mother cared about me.

36:53.085 --> 36:55.671
That doesn’t stop your true nature
from revealing itself.

36:56.339 --> 36:59.050
And what is my true nature,
according to you?

36:59.842 --> 37:03.304
When you get to thinking
about the way things feel...

37:05.306 --> 37:06.974
about physical pleasure...

37:09.101 --> 37:10.478
nothing else matters.

37:12.396 --> 37:16.317
Your desire, your lust takes over
every other part of your being.

37:17.526 --> 37:19.779
Is that what’s going to happen
to me now that I’m drinking?

37:20.112 --> 37:22.573
No, alcohol just greases the skids.

37:24.200 --> 37:27.828
-This is who you are.
-Well, having a kid doesn’t change that.

37:28.037 --> 37:29.205
No, it shouldn’t.

37:29.538 --> 37:32.124
My mother didn’t stop being
who she was when she had me.

37:33.334 --> 37:34.377
She had a life.

37:34.460 --> 37:37.004
-It’s good that you see it that way.
-JUSTIN: Definitely.

37:38.172 --> 37:39.966
She’d leave me money to buy myself dinner

37:40.967 --> 37:42.885
and she’d look in on me
when she got home.

37:43.386 --> 37:45.972
I’d play this little game
where I’d pretend to be asleep,

37:46.597 --> 37:48.724
and then open my eyes when she’d pass

37:48.808 --> 37:51.185
the Scooby-doo night light
that’s plugged in the wall.

37:51.394 --> 37:52.561
(CHUCKLES)

37:52.728 --> 37:58.609
I’d see her half naked, lipstick smeared,
going back to whoever was waiting for her.

37:58.734 --> 38:02.071
-She liked to have a good time.
-Yeah, she did.

38:03.322 --> 38:05.366
Just like you like to have a good time.

38:07.326 --> 38:09.453
-That’s right. (EXHALES)
-Hmm.

38:10.997 --> 38:15.376
You’re not really
ever gonna stop drinking.

38:16.627 --> 38:19.839
-Probably not.
-Drop another kid along the way.

38:20.673 --> 38:23.301
-Maybe.
-He’ll see what I saw.

38:26.220 --> 38:27.430
Possible.

(CLICKS TONGUE) Hear what I heard.

Don’t let the boy see you like that.

"Don’t do that to me, Mickey.
I don’t want to get crazy.

38:44.238 --> 38:46.449
"Don’t let him hear." (SCOFFS)

38:47.533 --> 38:52.121
Well, I don’t care if they hear.
It’s not the end of the world.

38:53.497 --> 38:57.251
-You’d let him hear, wouldn’t you?
-Hell, yeah.

38:57.710 --> 39:01.505
They’re in the other room crying,
pillows over their ears

39:01.630 --> 39:04.967
to block out the sound,
and you’re in here,

39:05.468 --> 39:08.804
waiting to get pounded
like some sloppy, wet skank.

39:09.263 --> 39:10.931
How long are you gonna make me wait?

39:11.265 --> 39:13.559
-You know what first, though?
-What, honey?

39:14.018 --> 39:17.271
First, I’m gonna choke the life out of you
like I did to the others,

39:17.855 --> 39:20.941

-Nice save.
-(SCOFFS) Thanks.

40:17.706 --> 40:20.960

I wanted to apologize for what I said

-to you and Baldwin earlier.
-Don’t worry about it.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.423
No, it... it wasn’t professional.

40:27.466 --> 40:33.764
Because the truth is, I wasn’t feeling
entirely professional about you and her.

40:34.807 --> 40:38.602
I appreciate you saying that,
because the truth is,

40:38.686 --> 40:40.521
I was a little uncomfortable
about it myself.
