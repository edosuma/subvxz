00:05.239 --> 00:07.575
(male announcer)
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:07.608 --> 00:11.545
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.647
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:13.681 --> 00:15.416
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:15.449 --> 00:17.118
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:17.151 --> 00:18.786
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:18.819 --> 00:21.122
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.457
NIGHT, NIGHT, ROSIE.

00:23.491 --> 00:27.261
GOODNIGHT, AMY.

00:27.295 --> 00:30.731
GREG, IF ROSIE HEARS YOU--

00:33.734 --> 00:34.835
SHE'S SLEEPING LIKE A BABY.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.205
GOOD, THEN LET'S
WATCH THE MOVIE.

00:37.238 --> 00:38.639
RHONDA SAYS IT'S AWESOME.

00:38.672 --> 00:40.674
THE BOY VAMPIRE
IS SO HOT.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.443
HOTTER THAN ME?

00:42.476 --> 00:44.178
OKAY, MAYBE NOT
THAT HOT.

00:44.212 --> 00:45.579
THEN LET'S SKIP
THE MOVIE

00:45.613 --> 00:47.047
AND GET RIGHT
TO THE GOOD PART.

00:54.855 --> 00:57.125
MORE.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.393
[pounding on door]

00:59.427 --> 01:01.262
WHO'S THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.

01:01.295 --> 01:02.596
(man)
POLICE, OPEN UP!

01:02.630 --> 01:04.165
THE COPS?
WHO CALLED THEM?

01:04.198 --> 01:05.533
[pounding on door]

01:05.566 --> 01:06.734
I SAID, OPEN THE DOOR.

01:06.767 --> 01:07.735
OKAY, I'M COMING.

01:07.768 --> 01:09.437
TAKE IT EASY.
I'M COMING.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.807
HURRY UP, LET'S GO.

01:16.477 --> 01:18.546
[Amy screams]

01:18.579 --> 01:19.713
NO, DON'T, PLEASE.

01:19.747 --> 01:20.748
NO, PLEASE,
DON'T HURT--

01:35.563 --> 01:36.730
NO FLUIDS ON HER BED.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.199
(Benson)
PERP WENT OUT THE WINDOW

01:38.232 --> 01:39.500
SO NOBODY WOULD SEE HIM
WITH THE KID.

01:39.533 --> 01:42.270
HE USES A FAKE POLICE BADGE,
WEARS A SKI MASK,

01:42.303 --> 01:44.172
AND KNOCKS OUT
ANY WITNESSES.

01:44.205 --> 01:45.439
TAKER'S A PRO.

01:45.473 --> 01:46.907
LOOKS LIKE ROSIE
PUT UP A FIGHT.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.576
SHE LEFT FOOT PRINTS
ON THE WINDOW.

01:48.609 --> 01:49.743
(Benson)
THE PERP LEAVE ANYTHING?

01:49.777 --> 01:50.544
NOTHING.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.246
BABYSITTER SAID
HE WORE GLOVES.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.381
HOW'S SHE DOING?

01:53.414 --> 01:55.183
SHE'S GOT A BROKEN NOSE.
PRETTY HYSTERICAL ABOUT ROSIE.

01:55.216 --> 01:57.251
E.M.T. SAID
TO SEDATE HER.

01:57.285 --> 01:57.951
WHAT ABOUT THE BOYFRIEND?

01:57.985 --> 02:01.422
HIS EGO
GOT THE WORST OF IT.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.424
WE REACH THE PARENTS YET?

02:03.457 --> 02:04.892
(Martin)
CALLS ARE GOING
STRAIGHT TO VOICEMAIL.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.594
I LEFT A MESSAGE FOR THEM
TO COME DOWN TO THE SQUAD.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.196
ANY IDEA WHERE THEY WENT?

02:08.229 --> 02:10.698
SITTER SAID THEY WERE DOING
DINNER AND A MOVIE.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.733
YOU GO OUT FOR A GOOD TIME,

02:12.766 --> 02:14.835
YOU COME HOME
TO A NIGHTMARE.

03:04.352 --> 03:05.819
A.P.B. IS OUT
ON ROSIE RINALDI.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.321
HER PHOTO IS ON THE WAY
TO EVERY POLICE DEPARTMENT,

03:07.355 --> 03:10.224
TOLL BOOTH, AIRPORT,
BUS STATION WITHIN 100 MILES.

03:10.258 --> 03:10.991
AMBER ALERT?

03:11.024 --> 03:12.426
IT'S IN THE WORKS
FOR JERSEY,

03:12.460 --> 03:13.861
DITTO CONNECTICUT
AND PENNSYLVANIA.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.863
FBI, NO CHILD ABDUCTIONS
IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS

03:15.896 --> 03:17.265
WITH OUR TAKER'S M.O.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.267
WHAT ABOUT THE CANVASES?

03:19.300 --> 03:20.501
IT'S A BUST SO FAR.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.869
NOBODY SAW HER
OR HEARD ANYTHING.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.237
FIN'S STILL ON IT.

03:23.271 --> 03:25.339
DETECTIVE BENSON?
I'M LIZ RINALDI.

03:25.373 --> 03:26.740
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

03:26.774 --> 03:28.342
OH, MY GOD,

03:28.376 --> 03:30.244
THAT'S ROSIE.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.645
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
WHAT HAPPENED?

03:31.679 --> 03:33.347
MRS. RINALDI,
YOUR DAUGHTER'S

03:33.381 --> 03:34.548
BEEN ABDUCTED
FROM YOUR HOME.

03:34.582 --> 03:37.285
NO!

03:37.318 --> 03:38.686
HEY, I'M PETE RINALDI,

03:38.719 --> 03:40.288
ROSIE'S STEPFATHER.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.855
WHAT AREN'T YOU OUT
ON THE STREET SEARCHING FOR HER?

03:41.889 --> 03:42.990
MR. AND MRS. RINALDI,
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN

03:43.023 --> 03:44.358
TO LOCATE YOUR DAUGHTER.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.260
GENO TOOK HER.

03:46.294 --> 03:47.928
GENO PARNELL,
HER BIOLOGICAL DAD

03:47.961 --> 03:49.397
AND A BUST-OUT LOSER.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.465
WE'LL RUN PARNELL
THROUGH THE SYSTEM.

03:51.499 --> 03:52.433
HE'S AN EX-CON.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.802
GOT OUT OF THE JOINT
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.270
WHAT WAS HE IN FOR?

03:56.304 --> 03:57.505
(Benson)
RAPE AND KIDNAPPING.

03:57.538 --> 04:00.374
HE ONLY DID THREE YEARS
AT SING SING.

04:00.408 --> 04:01.775
AT TRIAL, THE VICTIM
WOULDN'T TESTIFY.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.844
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN AFRAID
HE'D KILL HER IF SHE DID.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.045
LOOKS LIKE AFTER
THE FIRST JOLT

04:05.078 --> 04:07.281
HE STAYED CLEAN
FOR A WHILE.

04:07.315 --> 04:08.982
TILL HE GOT POPPED
FOR HOME INVASION

04:09.016 --> 04:09.983
AND GRAND LARCENY.

04:10.017 --> 04:13.354
NOT OUT OF PRISON THREE MONTHS,
HE HITS AGAIN,

04:13.387 --> 04:14.221
SNATCHING IS OWN DAUGHTER.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.790
THAT'S ABOUT AS SICK
AS IT GETS.

04:16.824 --> 04:17.858
I WAS 18 WHEN I MET GENO.

04:17.891 --> 04:20.394
I KNEW HE WAS TROUBLE,
BUT I WAS INTO THAT BACK THEN.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.562
I GOT PREGNANT WITH ROSIE.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.397
HE SAID HE'D CLEAN UP
HIS ACT.

04:23.431 --> 04:24.998
DOES YOUR EX
HAVE VISITATION?

04:25.032 --> 04:26.867
NO, WHEN HE GOT BUSTED
FOUR YEARS AGO,

04:26.900 --> 04:29.403
I WENT TO SEE HIM IN PRISON
AND I TOLD HIM IT WAS OVER.

04:29.437 --> 04:30.938
HOW'D HE TAKE THAT?

04:30.971 --> 04:32.406
BAD.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.841
HE STARTED BEATING ON ME

04:33.874 --> 04:35.976
IN FRONT OF ROSIE.

04:36.009 --> 04:38.979
THE GUARDS HAD TO PULL HIM
OFF OF ME.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.849
TWO WEEKS LATER, I HAD HIS
PARENTAL RIGHTS TERMINATED.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.352
SO ROSIE HASN'T SEEN
HER FATHER SINCE THEN?

04:44.385 --> 04:45.819
NO.
I'M HER FATHER.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.955
I WORK EVERY DAY,
PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE,

04:47.988 --> 04:49.390
KEEP A ROOF
OVER HER HEAD.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.024
THAT PRICK IS JUST
A SPERM DONOR.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.527
HE'S BEEN LOCKED UP
SINCE ROSIE'S BEEN IN DIAPERS.

04:53.561 --> 04:55.629
HAVE YOU HAD ANY CONTACT
WITH GENO SINCE HE GOT OUT?

04:55.663 --> 04:57.365
HE CALLED ONCE.

04:57.398 --> 05:00.334
HE SAID IF I EVER TRIED
TO TAKE ROSIE AWAY FROM HIM,

05:00.368 --> 05:01.902
HE WOULD MAKE MY LIFE
A LIVING HELL.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.937
(Fin)
YOU'RE GONNA WANT
TO SEE THIS.

05:03.971 --> 05:08.442
SURVEILLANCE TAPE
FROM THE APARTMENT BUILDING.

05:08.476 --> 05:10.678
CAMERA CAUGHT A GUY
GETTING A LITTLE TOO CLOSE

05:10.711 --> 05:12.446
TO ROSIE.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.722
OH, MY GOD,
THAT'S GENO.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.657
BASTARD'S NOT SUPPOSED TO COME
WITHIN 200 YARDS OF HER.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.426
I KNEW WE SHOULD HAVE MOVED.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.761
OH, MY GOD, HE'S GOT MY BABY,
AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

05:27.795 --> 05:29.763
MRS. RINALDI, WHY DON'T
WE GO SIT DOWN, COME ON.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.499
COME ON.
COME--COME ON.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.901
[sobbing]
ROSIE!

05:33.934 --> 05:35.102
REACH OUT TO PAROLE.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.070
PARNELL JUST GOT OUT
OF PRISON.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.873
HIS P.O. SHOULD KNOW
WHERE TO FIND HIM.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.777
FIRST COUPLE OF MONTHS
AFTER HE GOT OUT OF SING SING,

05:43.811 --> 05:46.414
PARNELL DID EVERYTHING
BY THE BOOK.

05:46.447 --> 05:47.681
HE MADE HIS APPOINTMENTS.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.082
HE PASSED HIS PISS TESTS.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.418
THEN HE STOPPED
SHOWING UP.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.885
AND YOU DIDN'T VIOLATE
HIS PAROLE?

05:51.919 --> 05:53.421
OF COURSE I DID.

05:53.454 --> 05:54.922
BUT FINDING A LOSER
LIKE PARNELL

05:54.955 --> 05:56.990
IS WAY DOWN
ON MY SCUMBAG TOTEM POLE.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.492
MAYBE IF YOU'D TRIED,
A LITTLE GIRL WOULD BE HOME

05:58.526 --> 05:59.960
AND SAFE IN HER BED
RIGHT NOW.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.562
HEY, DON'T BLAME ME.
BLAME THE CITY.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.130
WE JUST DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH MANPOWER.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.732
AND YOU CAN LIVE
WITH THAT?

06:04.765 --> 06:06.033
FOR THE NEXT 80 DAYS

06:06.066 --> 06:07.868
UNTIL I TAKE MY PENSION

06:07.901 --> 06:09.503
AND SAY GOOD-BYE
TO THESE ANIMALS.

06:09.537 --> 06:12.440
LET'S PUT THIS ONE
BACK IN HIS CAGE, HUH?

06:12.473 --> 06:13.574
GENO'S IN ROOM 1F.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.676
HEY, HEY,
TURN THAT CRAP DOWN.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.545
I'LL THROW YOUR ASS
OUTTA HERE.

06:17.578 --> 06:18.746
TOUGH LOVE, HUH?

06:18.779 --> 06:20.113
YOU GOTTA GET TOUGH
ON THESE GUYS.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.515
THEY'LL WALK
ALL OVER YOU.

06:21.549 --> 06:22.816
GENO PARNELL, YOU GOT
TO GET TOUGH ON HIM?

06:22.850 --> 06:24.552
HE'S A CREEP, HE NEVER DRINKS
WITH THE FELLAS.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.487
HE'S ALWAYS TALKING
ABOUT LITTLE GIRLS.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.921
IF HE DIDN'T PAY
HIS RENT ON TIME,

06:27.955 --> 06:29.590
I'D KICK HIS ASS
OUT TOO.

06:29.623 --> 06:32.526
SO PERVS ARE WELCOME
AS LONG AS THEY PAY YOU?

06:32.560 --> 06:34.061
HIS MONEY'S
AS GREEN AS YOURS.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.128
[knocking]

06:35.162 --> 06:37.030
GENO PARNELL, POLICE!

06:37.064 --> 06:38.031
OPEN IT.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.200
I'M SORRY, DETECTIVE.
EVEN BUST-OUTS GOT RIGHTS.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.070
I AIN'T OPENING NOTHING
WITHOUT A WARRANT.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.706
GOOD THING A PAROLE OFFICER
DOESN'T NEED ONE.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.577
WASN'T SO HARD,
WAS IT?

06:49.610 --> 06:51.479
NO GENO.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.547
(Stabler)
BUT PLENTY OF ROSIE.

06:53.581 --> 06:54.782
AT THE PLAYGROUND.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.183
WALKING HOME FROM SCHOOL.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.552
MOST OF THEM TAKEN
FROM A DISTANCE.

06:58.586 --> 06:59.286
HE'S BEEN ON HER

06:59.319 --> 07:01.021
LIKE A LION
STALKING HIS DINNER.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.222
WEARING LOTS
OF DIFFERENT OUTFITS.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.557
MUST HAVE BEEN WATCHING HER
FOR A MONTH.

07:03.591 --> 07:04.858
PROBABLY SINCE
HE GOT OUT.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.059
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW GENO?

07:06.093 --> 07:07.728
MAYBE A COUPLE DAYS AGO.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.463
WHAT THE HELL ARE THESE?

07:09.497 --> 07:10.664
TOKENS.

07:10.698 --> 07:12.566
THAT'S HOW HE PAYS HIS RENT.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.568
THESE WON'T GET YOU
ON THE SUBWAY.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.103
YEAH, BUT THEY WILL
GET YOU OFF.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.171
THEY'RE FROM THAT JACK SHACK
HE WORKS AT OVER ON BROADWAY.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.206
EACH ONE OF THEM'S WORTH

07:19.239 --> 07:20.874
SOME PRIVATE
ADULT ENTERTAINMENT.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.209
LENNON, YOU LET HIM WORK
AT A SEX SHOP?

07:22.242 --> 07:25.479
PLEASE, I GOT HIM A GIG
AT A GAS STATION.

07:25.513 --> 07:26.880
HE MUST HAVE BEEN
MOONLIGHTING.

07:26.914 --> 07:30.083
WELL, OUR NEXT STOP'S
THE NUT HUT.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.154
(Fin)
THEY GOT A NICE SELECTION.

07:34.187 --> 07:36.924
NO WONDER GENO GOT REVVED UP
AND HIT AGAIN.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.559
LIKE A KID IN A CANDY STORE.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.160
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
LET'S ZIP IT UP.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.895
FORREST HUMP WILL STILL
BE HERE TOMORROW.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.263
WHOA, WHOA, BOTH OF YOUS,
BACK THE HELL UP.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.297
YOU FIRST.

07:44.331 --> 07:47.067
YOU CAN'T COME IN HERE
CHASING OFF MY CLIENTS.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.737
I RUN A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS
FOR MATURE ADULTS ONLY.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.238
YOU GOT A STORE
FULL OF PERVS

07:51.271 --> 07:52.773
WITH THEIR PANTS
AROUND THEIR ANKLES.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.041
THAT'S VERY MATURE.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.109
GENO PARNELL,
WHERE IS HE?

07:56.143 --> 07:57.277
DON'T KNOW HIM.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.278
LET ME REFRESH YOUR MEMORY.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.914
HE'S THE EX-CON THAT
YOU'RE PAYING OFF THE BOOKS.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.216
YEAH, WE COULD HAVE
THE I.R.S. COME ON IN HERE

08:03.250 --> 08:05.252
AND HELP YOU LOOK
FOR HIS W-2s.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.220
GENO'S IN BACK.

08:07.254 --> 08:09.089
MOP DUTY.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.662
(Fin)
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

08:14.695 --> 08:16.964
LOOKS LIKE LET'S MAKE A DEAL
IN HELL.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.199
I'LL PICK DOOR NUMBER ONE.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.702
GET YOUR OWN BOOTH.
THIS IS A PRIVATE PARTY.

08:26.674 --> 08:28.275
ONE AT A TIME,
SWEETHEART.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.946
GENO PARNELL,
POLICE.

08:45.593 --> 08:47.995
FREEZE!

08:48.028 --> 08:50.564
FREEZE!
FREEZE!

08:52.600 --> 08:53.734
I DIDN'T DO NOTHING.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.102
YOU TRAINING FOR
THE MARATHON, HUH?

08:55.135 --> 08:56.269
ON YOUR KNEES.

09:01.709 --> 09:03.243
WHERE'S ROSIE, GENO?
I DON'T KNOW.

09:03.276 --> 09:04.778
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO SEE HER.

09:04.812 --> 09:05.779
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

09:05.813 --> 09:06.880
A LITTLE GIRL'S
BARRETTE.

09:06.914 --> 09:09.216
WHAT, YOU PUTTING YOUR HAIR
UP IN A PONYTAIL NOW?

09:09.249 --> 09:11.585
JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING
I KEEP TO REMEMBER HER BY.

09:11.619 --> 09:12.653
YEAH, IT'S CALLED
A SOUVENIR.

09:12.686 --> 09:13.754
I GOT ONE FOR YOU--

09:13.787 --> 09:15.789
A ONE-WAY TICKET
BACK TO PRISON.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.294
(Geno)
I DIDN'T BREAK NO LAW.

09:21.328 --> 09:22.295
THESE SHOTS WERE TAKEN
200 FEET AWAY.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.932
THAT'S HOW FAR THE COURT
SAYS I HAVE TO STAY AWAY

09:24.965 --> 09:26.600
FROM MY OWN FLESH AND BLOOD.

09:26.634 --> 09:27.701
SO IT'S OKAY FOR YOU
TO STALK YOUR DAUGHTER

09:27.735 --> 09:29.102
AS LONG AS YOU
DO IT LEGALLY?

09:29.136 --> 09:30.638
IT'S MY LITTLE GIRL.
THESE PICTURES ARE ALL I GOT.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.005
OH, YOU'RE BREAKING
MY HEART.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.707
YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE LUCKY
I'M NOT BREAKING YOUR FACE.

09:33.741 --> 09:36.076
TAKE IT EASY, PAL, YOU'RE
IN ENOUGH TROUBLE ALREADY.

09:36.109 --> 09:39.346
HEY, I GOT A RIGHT
TO SEE MY KID.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.615
NOT THIS CLOSE YOU DON'T.

09:41.649 --> 09:43.951
IT WAS HER BIRTHDAY.
I WANTED TO GIVE HER A PRESENT.

09:43.984 --> 09:46.319
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU TOOK ONE INSTEAD.

09:46.353 --> 09:47.821
HMM?

09:47.855 --> 09:49.089
NOW WE FOUND
HAIR IN THIS THING.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.624
DNA'S GONNA SAY
IT'S ROSIE.

09:50.658 --> 09:52.860
ONE LOUSY CLIP,
THAT'S ALL I GOT OF HER.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.662
BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH.

09:54.695 --> 09:57.030
YOU TOUCHED HER ONE TIME,
YOU HAD TO HAVE MORE.

09:57.064 --> 09:59.366
ARE YOU CALLING ME
A PERVERT?

09:59.399 --> 10:00.968
WHAT DO YOU CALL A GUY
WHO KIDNAPS AND RAPES

10:01.001 --> 10:02.202
A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL?

10:02.235 --> 10:03.737
AH, IT WAS
A MISUNDERSTANDING.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.238
JUDGE CALLED IT
A CONVICTION.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.406
YEAH, I PICKED
THAT CHICK UP IN A BAR.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.241
SHE SAID SHE WAS 20.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.744
HELL, THE BARTENDER'S
SERVING HER DRINKS.

10:10.778 --> 10:12.680
HUH, HOW MANY GIRLS
DO YOU DOUBLE-CHECK THEIR I.D.

10:12.713 --> 10:13.747
BEFORE YOU PICK THEM UP?

10:13.781 --> 10:15.783
I DON'T PICK UP
15-YEAR-OLDS.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.384
WELL, IF I KNEW HER AGE,
I WOULDN'T HAVE TOUCHED HER.

10:17.417 --> 10:18.385
SHE TRICKED ME.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.120
SHE TRICKED YOU.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.723
SHE TRICK YOU INTO
KIDNAPPING HER TOO?

10:22.756 --> 10:24.692
WE HOOKED UP
FOR THE WEEKEND.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.426
SHE WENT HOME,
AND HER DAD CALLED THE POLICE.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.095
SO YOU DIDN'T SNATCH HER?
NO.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.063
NO?
WHY WOULD YOU COP A PLEA?

10:30.097 --> 10:31.398
BECAUSE THE D.A.
OFFERED THREE YEARS,

10:31.431 --> 10:33.767
AND I WAS FACING
12 1/2 TO 25.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.435
AND I DIDN'T WANT
TO RISK IT.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.671
AND THEN THOSE BASTARDS
JOBBED ME.

10:37.705 --> 10:38.739
OKAY.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.708
THE GIRL, SHE REFUSED
TO TESTIFY.
OKAY, OKAY.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.209
IF I'D HAVE GONE TO TRIAL,
I WOULD HAVE WALKED.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.144
YOU'RE INNOCENT LIKE EVERYBODY
ELSE IN PRISON,

10:44.177 --> 10:46.379
WHICH IS WHERE
YOU'RE GOING.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.415
NO, MAN, COME ON.

10:48.448 --> 10:51.218
ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS SEE
MY LITTLE GIRL ON HER BIRTHDAY.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.452
DON'T LOCK ME UP
FOR THAT.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.354
NO, NO, I'M LOCKING YOU UP
FOR KIDNAPPING ROSIE.

10:54.387 --> 10:55.388
NOW WHERE IS SHE?

10:55.422 --> 10:57.758
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
SOMEBODY TOOK ROSIE?

10:57.791 --> 10:59.059
YOU STROKED HER HAIR,
BUT SHE RAN AWAY?

10:59.092 --> 11:00.994
HEY, THAT'S SICK!
HEY, THAT'S MY KID.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.996
EVERY GIRL GETTING GUYS OFF
AT THE NUT HUT

11:03.030 --> 11:04.364
IS SOMEBODY'S KID.

11:04.397 --> 11:05.999
THAT DIDN'T STOP YOU
FROM WORKING THERE.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.768
THE GAS STATION
PAYS MINIMUM WAGE.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.737
I WORK AT THE NUT HUT
FOR THE EXTRA CASH

11:09.770 --> 11:10.637
AND BECAUSE THEY DON'T
DO BACKGROUND CHECKS.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.272
AND YOU'RE A PERVERT.
NO, YOU'RE WRONG!

11:12.305 --> 11:13.473
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.808
I DIDN'T TAKE ROSIE.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.777
I WAS WORKING
ALL LAST NIGHT.

11:16.810 --> 11:17.945
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT.
CHECK.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.279
I SWEAR!

11:19.312 --> 11:20.413
WHAT THE--

11:20.447 --> 11:21.548
YOU GOTTA HELP ME
FIND ROSIE.

11:21.581 --> 11:23.751
YOU MEAN BURY HER BODY DEEPER
SO SHE WON'T BE FOUND.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.452
SIT DOWN!

11:25.485 --> 11:27.087
[groaning]

11:34.161 --> 11:37.030
[groans]

11:37.064 --> 11:38.365
I HAD HIM.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.133
YEAH, LIKE CUSTER
HAD THE INDIANS.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.470
(Geno)
I WANT OUTTA HERE!

11:43.503 --> 11:44.738
LET ME OUT OF HERE!

11:44.772 --> 11:45.739
GENO, CALM DOWN.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.107
I GOTTA FIND ROSIE.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.876
WOULD YOU LET ME OUTTA HERE?

11:48.909 --> 11:51.812
YOU WANT OUT,
YOU ANSWER MY QUESTIONS.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.881
SO ASK!
DID YOU TAKE
YOUR DAUGHTER?

11:53.914 --> 11:55.415
I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.050
I LOVE ROSIE.
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO HER.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.953
WHO TOOK HER?

11:59.987 --> 12:03.023
I DON'T KNOW.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.826
LOOK, MAN,

12:05.859 --> 12:09.396
I HAVE MADE A LOT OF BAD
DECISIONS IN MY LIFE.

12:09.429 --> 12:10.898
MM-HMM.

12:10.931 --> 12:14.234
BUT I WOULD NEVER
DO ANYTHING

12:14.267 --> 12:15.468
TO HURT MY KID.

12:15.502 --> 12:16.904
SO WHO'S LOOKING
TO HURT YOU?

12:16.937 --> 12:19.206
THE ONLY ONE
WITH A GRUDGE IS MY EX.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.279
LIZ SET ME UP.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.048
WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?

12:28.081 --> 12:29.482
BECAUSE SHE'S
A CON ARTIST.

12:29.516 --> 12:30.517
YOU'RE THE ONE
WITH THE RAP SHEET.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.552
LIZ HAS NEVER BEEN
LOCKED UP.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.787
IT'S IN HER BLOOD.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.789
HER OLD MAN
IS FRANK HAGER.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.791
THAT GUY'D STEAL ANYTHING
THAT AIN'T NAILED DOWN.

12:37.825 --> 12:40.861
HER OLD MAN
HAS A LOT OF ENEMIES.

12:40.894 --> 12:44.297
MAYBE ONE OF THEM SNATCHED
MY ROSIE TO GET EVEN.

12:44.331 --> 12:46.366
(Cragen)
FRANK HAGER WAS ONE
OF THE BEST THIEVES

12:46.399 --> 12:48.501
IN THE CITY
FOR OVER 40 YEARS.

12:48.535 --> 12:49.937
BACK IN THE '60s
AND '70s,

12:49.970 --> 12:51.839
IF A BIG SCORE WENT DOWN,

12:51.872 --> 12:52.973
ODDS ARE HAGER WAS
THE MASTERMIND.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.407
I COLLARED HIM MYSELF ONCE

12:54.441 --> 12:56.109
WHEN I WAS A PATROLMAN.

12:56.143 --> 12:57.510
HE'S THAT OLD, HUH?

12:57.544 --> 12:59.346
JEWEL HEISTS,
BANK JOBS,

12:59.379 --> 13:01.248
ARMORED CARS.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.883
GUY'S TALENTED.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.584
HE STOLE AN R.M.P. ONCE
WITH THE COP ASLEEP IN THE BACK

13:04.617 --> 13:06.586
JUST TO PROVE HE COULD.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.754
IT LOOKS LIKE HAGER'S
GONE INTO RETIREMENT.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.357
HIS LAST ARREST WAS '04 FOR
POSSESSION OF STOLEN PROPERTY,

13:10.390 --> 13:11.558
A TRUCKLOAD OF TVs.

13:11.591 --> 13:12.559
HE WALKED.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.494
LOOK WHO DIDN'T.

13:14.527 --> 13:17.297
HIS SON-IN-LAW,
GENO PARNELL.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.599
GENO DOES FOUR YEARS
FOR LIZ'S FATHER,

13:19.632 --> 13:21.468
AND THEN SHE KICKS HIM
TO THE CURB.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.203
EVERYBODY'S HANDS
ARE A LITTLE DIRTY HERE.

13:23.236 --> 13:24.872
(Fin)
FRANK SPENT A LOT OF YEARS
IN THE BUSINESS.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.840
HE MUST HAVE MADE
SOME ENEMIES.

13:26.874 --> 13:27.941
WELL, BACK IN THE DAY,

13:27.975 --> 13:29.509
HE RIPPED OFF
A MOBBED UP NUMBERS JOINT.

13:29.542 --> 13:31.912
THE FIVE FAMILIES
PUT A HIT ON HIM.

13:31.945 --> 13:34.081
WORD WAS HE BOUGHT 'EM OFF
WITH AN AIRPORT JOB--

13:34.114 --> 13:35.883
HIT PAN AM FOR A COUPLE
OF MIL IN CARGO.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.184
YEAH, BUT THAT WAS THEN.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.952
MAYBE THIS TIME
HE PISSED SOMEBODY OFF

13:38.986 --> 13:40.020
THAT HE COULDN'T BUY.

13:40.053 --> 13:42.522
THEY TARGETED HIS FAMILY.

13:44.925 --> 13:45.859
(Liz)
MY FATHER'S RETIRED.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.460
WHY DO YOU WANT TO HARASS
AN OLD MAN?

13:47.494 --> 13:48.595
(Stabler)
JUST TO ASK HIM

13:48.628 --> 13:49.429
IF ANY OF HIS OLD PALS

13:49.462 --> 13:51.164
WOULD GET EVEN
BY SNATCHING ROSIE.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.632
THEN YOU SHOULD GO TALK
TO MY EX.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.267
GENO'S GOT MY BABY.

13:54.301 --> 13:55.602
HE WAS WORKING.

13:55.635 --> 13:57.337
THERE'S NO WAY
HE TOOK HER.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.272
WHERE'S YOUR DAD?

13:59.306 --> 14:01.108
I DON'T KNOW.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.442
RAP SHEET SAYS
HE LIVES HERE.

14:02.475 --> 14:03.911
HE USED TO.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.112
AFTER MY MOM DIED,

14:05.145 --> 14:06.880
HE GAVE ME THE APARTMENT
AND MOVED OUT.

14:06.914 --> 14:09.449
HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT ME
TO WORRY ABOUT SAVING

14:09.482 --> 14:10.918
FOR COLLEGE FOR ROSIE.

14:10.951 --> 14:11.985
WHERE'S YOUR DAD LIVE NOW?

14:12.019 --> 14:13.987
IN THE APARTMENT
ABOVE HIS STORE.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.056
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
HE WAS RETIRED.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.125
WHAT STORE?

14:18.158 --> 14:19.659
HE RUNS A PAWN SHOP.

14:19.692 --> 14:20.994
(Fin)
THERE'S NO WAY THEY WOULD GIVE

14:21.028 --> 14:23.030
A CONVICTED THIEF
A LICENSE TO HOCK.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.998
HE DID THE PAPERS
IN HIS DEAD BROTHER'S NAME.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.599
WHAT'S THE ADDRESS?

14:26.633 --> 14:29.937
BENNY LOMBARDI'S ON 39th.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.907
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY
GOT HERE FIRST.

14:33.941 --> 14:36.076
I'LL CHECK UPSTAIRS.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.982
HEY!

14:42.015 --> 14:43.016
[groaning]

14:43.050 --> 14:44.084
POLICE!

14:44.117 --> 14:45.185
EASY, EASY, EASY.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.254
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
A ROBBER.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.622
GET UP.
OKAY.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.491
WOULD YOU GIVE
AN OLD GUY A HAND?

14:51.524 --> 14:52.659
THANK YOU.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.527
WHAT THE HELL,
WERE YOU A LINEBACKER?

14:54.561 --> 14:57.030
STRONG SAFETY.
WHERE'S FRANK?

14:57.064 --> 14:58.999
I DON'T KNOW.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.067
YOU WORK HERE?

15:00.100 --> 15:01.634
NO, HE'S MY FRIEND.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.937
WE HAVE COFFEE
EVERY MORNING.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.305
TWO DAYS
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

15:05.338 --> 15:06.940
SO I CAME TO CHECK.

15:06.974 --> 15:08.541
YOU SWING FIRST,
ASK QUESTIONS LATER, HUH?

15:08.575 --> 15:09.709
AN OLD HABIT.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.045
HEY, OH, WAIT, WAIT.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.680
FRANK'S NOT HERE.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.148
IF YOU SEE HIM,
HAVE HIM CALL ME.

15:15.182 --> 15:16.349
YOU GOT THAT?
I GOT IT.

15:16.383 --> 15:17.951
IT'S IMPORTANT.
YES, YES, YES.

15:17.985 --> 15:20.453
EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.622
WHO THE HELL WAS HE?

15:22.655 --> 15:23.723
A CONCERNED CITIZEN.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.226
IT LOOKED LIKE A TORNADO
HIT UPSTAIRS.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.296
NO SIGN OF THE OLD MAN.

15:29.329 --> 15:30.497
YOU SMELL THAT?

15:30.530 --> 15:33.000
[sniffs]
YEAH, YOU STEP IN SOMETHING?

15:38.105 --> 15:40.207
IT'S COMING FROM
UNDERNEATH THE FLOOR.

15:49.216 --> 15:50.550
IT'S A TRAPDOOR.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.396
IT'S A PANIC ROOM.

16:06.699 --> 16:09.502
TAKE IT EASY, FELLAS.
I GOT THE MONEY.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.004
FRANK?

16:13.306 --> 16:15.708
HERE IT IS.

16:15.742 --> 16:18.078
ALL OF IT.

16:18.111 --> 16:20.780
SO NOBODY'S GOT
TO GET HURT, OKAY?

16:20.813 --> 16:22.015
COME ON, FRANK.

16:22.049 --> 16:23.750
I TOLD YOU I'D
TAKE CARE OF YOUS.

16:23.783 --> 16:26.786
NOW WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GO GET SOME SALISBURY STEAKS

16:26.819 --> 16:31.258
AT THE FOUNTAIN BLUE?

16:31.291 --> 16:34.427
IT'S ALL THERE.
DON'T YOU TRUST ME?

16:34.461 --> 16:35.728
GOTTA BE AT LEAST
100 GRAND IN HERE.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.397
YEAH.
FRANK, WHO'S THE MONEY FOR?

16:37.430 --> 16:39.066
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.101
FRANK NEVER SCREWS UP.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.544
PUT 20 ON THE BERWYN KID
ACROSS THE BOARD.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.380
CICERO TO SHOW.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.615
GUY'S BEEN RAMBLING LIKE THIS
SINCE WE FOUND HIM.

16:55.648 --> 16:58.551
BACK IN '74, WE ARRESTED HIM
FOR GRAND LARCENY.

16:58.585 --> 17:01.088
HE WAS LOOKING
AT SERIOUS TIME.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.822
HE ATE HIS SHOE,
THE WHOLE THING.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.125
HE WOUND UP IN THE FUNNY FARM
INSTEAD OF PRISON.

17:05.158 --> 17:06.659
TWO WEEKS LATER,
HE WALTZES OUT THE DOOR

17:06.693 --> 17:07.827
AND LAUGHS AT US ALL.

17:07.860 --> 17:08.795
SO YOU'RE
NOT BUYING IT?

17:08.828 --> 17:10.130
I THINK FRANK IS REVIVING

17:10.163 --> 17:11.698
HIS OLD ACT
SO HE DOESN'T HAVE

17:11.731 --> 17:13.133
TO TELL US WHERE ROSIE IS.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.534
WELL, SOMEBODY
TRASHED HIS PLACE.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.569
AND HE WAS HIDING
IN HIS BASEMENT.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.805
GUY'S DEFINITELY
AFRAID OF SOMETHING.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.240
WE NEED HUANG DOWN HERE
TO TELL US IF THIS GUY

17:20.273 --> 17:21.508
IS A FRAUD OR A FREAK.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.143
EITHER WAY, I THINK FRANK KNOWS
SOMETHING ABOUT THE KIDNAPPING.

17:23.176 --> 17:25.678
I SEE A GUY
WITH 100K IN A SUITCASE,

17:25.712 --> 17:27.480
HIS GRANDDAUGHTER'S
JUST BEEN SNATCHED,

17:27.514 --> 17:29.082
I'M THINKING RANSOM.

17:29.116 --> 17:31.218
HEY, HE IS YOUR OLD PAL.

17:31.251 --> 17:32.552
YOU WANT TO TAKE
A CRACK AT HIM?

17:32.585 --> 17:35.788
HE'S NO PAL OF MINE.
ALL YOURS.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.257
[dialing]

17:39.492 --> 17:41.328
(Frank)
SO A GUY FALLS OFF

17:41.361 --> 17:43.163
THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING,

17:43.196 --> 17:44.697
HITS THE GROUND.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.733
A FELLA COMES BY,
LOOKS DOWN AND SAYS,

17:46.766 --> 17:48.501
"MY GOD, MISTER,
WHAT HAPPENED?"

17:48.535 --> 17:50.203
HE LOOKS UP FROM THE GROUND,
HE SAYS,

17:50.237 --> 17:51.771
"I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST GOT HERE."

17:51.804 --> 17:53.140
THAT'S A GOOD ONE,
FRANK.

17:53.173 --> 17:54.774
SIT.
LET'S TALK.

17:54.807 --> 17:56.576
SO WE--
ARE WE GONNA BE PALS

17:56.609 --> 17:58.578
OR AM I IN TROUBLE OR--

17:58.611 --> 18:00.313
WHY WOULD YOU
BE IN TROUBLE?

18:00.347 --> 18:01.548
[chuckles]

18:01.581 --> 18:02.849
YOU MP's
ARE ALL THE SAME.

18:02.882 --> 18:04.851
YOU'RE ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR A LITTLE TASTE,

18:04.884 --> 18:07.320
WHICH IS NORMALLY FINE.

18:07.354 --> 18:08.888
BUT TONIGHT,
UNFORTUNATELY,

18:08.921 --> 18:11.224
I GOT ROLLED
BY A COUPLE OF GYRENES.

18:11.258 --> 18:12.725
THEY CLEANED ME OUT.
HMM.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.195
FORTUNATELY,
I, UH, I GOT A FEW

18:15.228 --> 18:16.796
EXTRA BOX
UNDER THE BUNK.

18:16.829 --> 18:17.864
YEAH?

18:17.897 --> 18:19.699
YEAH, WHAT, LIKE,
$100,000?

18:19.732 --> 18:21.601
YEAH.
YEAH?

18:21.634 --> 18:25.805
I--I THINK I CAN GET YOU
50 BUCKS.

18:25.838 --> 18:27.474
MAYBE 60,

18:27.507 --> 18:31.144
BUT IT'S BACK
AT THE SHIP.

18:31.178 --> 18:33.246
WHAT SHIP?

18:33.280 --> 18:34.447
U.S.S. MAGPIE,

18:34.481 --> 18:36.583
AMS 25.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.850
I THOUGHT THE MAGPIE

18:37.884 --> 18:41.221
WAS DECOMMISSIONED
BEFORE VIETNAM.

18:41.254 --> 18:43.190
TOKING ON THE WACKY WEED,
ARE YOU?

18:43.223 --> 18:45.192
YOU BETTER STAY
IN SHAPE, PAL.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.394
THESE NORTH KOREANS
LOOK LIKE THEY MEAN BUSINESS.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.462
SO NOW YOU'RE FIGHTING
THE KOREAN WAR?

18:49.496 --> 18:51.264
HEY, HEY, TRUST ME--

18:51.298 --> 18:53.533
WE DON'T TAKE CARE OF THEM
COMMIE BASTARDS RIGHT NOW,

18:53.566 --> 18:56.303
THEY'RE GONNA
RUIN THE WORLD.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.471
FRANK.

18:58.505 --> 19:01.174
FRANK, WHERE'S YOUR
GRANDDAUGHTER?
WHAT?

19:01.208 --> 19:02.342
WHERE'S YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER?
NO, NO, NO.

19:02.375 --> 19:03.643
HEY, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.212
I GOT BUDDIES OVER HERE
WHO GOT KIDS

19:05.245 --> 19:06.613
RUNNING AROUND
ALL OVER THE PLACE,

19:06.646 --> 19:08.748
BUT NOT FRANK HAGER.

19:08.781 --> 19:11.284
MR. JOHNSON ALWAYS WEARS
A RAINCOAT.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.320
ALWAYS.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.422
YOU HAVE NO KIDS?

19:15.455 --> 19:17.224
NO KIDS.

19:17.257 --> 19:21.261
AND SURE AS HELL
NO GRANDKIDS.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.962
I'M DONE YAKKING WITH YOUS.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.664
EITHER I GET BACK
TO MY SHORE LEAVE

19:24.697 --> 19:25.932
OR TAKE ME TO THE BRIG.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.700
THAT'S--
SIT TIGHT.

19:27.734 --> 19:30.237
(Huang)
HE'S SUNDOWNING.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.871
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

19:31.904 --> 19:33.740
PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA ARE USUALLY
MORE LUCID IN THE MORNING.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.442
THEY TEND TO GET IRRITABLE
AS THE DAY GOES ON.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.210
WE CAN'T WAIT TILL TOMORROW
FOR ANSWERS.

19:37.244 --> 19:39.946
WELL, I'M NOT SURE YOU'RE
GONNA GET THEM AT ALL.

19:39.979 --> 19:42.282
SO YOU THINK THIS NONSENSE
HE'S SPEWING IS THE REAL DEAL?

19:42.315 --> 19:44.217
HE GOES IN AND OUT
OF REALITY.

19:44.251 --> 19:45.618
HIS MEMORY IS RANDOM

19:45.652 --> 19:46.786
BITS AND PIECES OF HIS LIFE

19:46.819 --> 19:48.855
MASHED TOGETHER INTO
A NONSENSICAL PUZZLE.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.223
CLASSIC ALZHEIMER'S.

19:50.257 --> 19:52.359
ANY WAY TO JOG THAT MEMORY?

19:52.392 --> 19:53.893
ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS
LIVE IN THE PAST.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.328
SOMETIMES AN OLD FRIEND
OR FAMILY MEMBER

19:55.362 --> 19:56.863
CAN TRIGGER A MOMENT
OF LUCIDITY.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.738
GENO.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.006
HEY, FRANKIE.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.475
WHERE THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN?

20:08.508 --> 20:10.743
I WAS STARTING
TO WORRY ABOUT YOU.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.312
NO CALL,
NO NOTHING.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.314
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SINCE
THAT BANK JOB WENT SOUTH.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.582
OH, YEAH,
THAT WAS 1999.

20:15.615 --> 20:16.749
YEAH.

20:16.783 --> 20:17.850
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.819
SOMEONE MUST HAVE
TIPPED OFF THE BULLS.
YEAH.

20:19.852 --> 20:22.455
I HAD TO HIDE OUT IN THAT
FARM HOUSE IN PENNSYLVANIA.

20:22.489 --> 20:24.957
THAT AMISH BROAD
WITH THE WHISKERS.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.859
SHE TAKE CARE OF YOU?

20:26.893 --> 20:27.994
SHE SURE DID.

20:28.027 --> 20:29.729
[both chuckle]

20:29.762 --> 20:32.365
HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN
ROSIE LATELY?

20:32.399 --> 20:34.000
WHO?
ROSIE.

20:34.033 --> 20:37.270
DON'T KNOW ANY ROSIE.

20:37.304 --> 20:40.273
WHO'S THE JAMOKE?

20:40.307 --> 20:41.908
[clears throat]

20:41.941 --> 20:44.744
HE'S MY, UH--
HE'S MY NEW ENTRY MAN.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.012
WHO'D YOU WORK FOR
BEFORE GENO?

20:46.045 --> 20:47.514
(Stabler)
SOLANOS OUT OF BROOKLYN.

20:47.547 --> 20:50.283
DID A LOT OF WORK
FOR THEM IN FLORIDA.

20:50.317 --> 20:51.183
YEAH.

20:51.217 --> 20:52.452
THE TRICK WITH THEM
FLORIDA SNOW BIRDS

20:52.485 --> 20:53.653
IS FIRE.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.488
YOU PUT A CIGARETTE
OUT ON THE WIFE,

20:55.522 --> 20:57.624
AND HER HUSBAND'S RUNNING
TO OPEN THE SAFE.

20:57.657 --> 21:01.060
[chuckles]

21:01.093 --> 21:03.930
LISTEN,
DON'T HURT HER, OKAY?

21:03.963 --> 21:06.366
I'LL GET YOU
YOUR JEWELS BACK.

21:06.399 --> 21:09.302
WHO YOU TALKING ABOUT,
FRANK?

21:09.336 --> 21:11.371
ROSIE.

21:11.404 --> 21:12.639
LET HER GO.

21:12.672 --> 21:15.308
WHO, FRANK?

21:15.342 --> 21:18.378
WHO SHOULD LET HER GO?

21:23.616 --> 21:25.385
WHO'S GOT ROSIE, FRANK?

21:25.418 --> 21:28.955
LOOK, PAL, IF I WANT
ANY LIP OUTTA YOU,

21:28.988 --> 21:31.391
I'LL, UH, I'LL RATTLE
MY ZIPPER, OKAY?

21:31.424 --> 21:33.360
WE JUST WANT
TO FIND ROSIE.

21:33.393 --> 21:35.562
HAVE A LITTLE RESPECT.

21:35.595 --> 21:38.331
I'M FENCING 750 Gs

21:38.365 --> 21:40.933
OF HARRY WINSTON'S FINEST.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.436
I'M A PROFESSIONAL.

21:43.470 --> 21:45.071
I WAS DOING JOBS WHEN YOU
WERE FILLING YOUR DIAPERS.

21:45.104 --> 21:46.406
WHOA.
TAKE IT EASY.

21:46.439 --> 21:48.107
YOU'RE JUST A WANNABE.
TAKE IT--

21:48.140 --> 21:50.443
HEY, DON'T TELL ME
WHAT TO DO!

21:50.477 --> 21:51.778
I'LL HACK YOUR FEET OFF,
PAL.

21:51.811 --> 21:52.979
HEY! HEY!

21:53.012 --> 21:54.981
LIKE I DID THAT PUNK FROM---
SHUT UP, FRANK!

21:55.014 --> 21:57.417
NO ONE NEEDS TO HEAR
ABOUT THAT.

21:57.450 --> 22:00.987
FRANK,
YOU TOOK ME IN.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.655
YOU LOVED ME
LIKE A FATHER.

22:02.689 --> 22:05.091
I DID FOUR YEARS
HARD TIME FOR YOU,

22:05.124 --> 22:07.660
AND I HAVE NEVER
ASKED YOU FOR ANYTHING.

22:07.694 --> 22:10.963
PLEASE, TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED TO ROSIE.

22:12.965 --> 22:13.933
ROSIE?
WHAT--

22:13.966 --> 22:16.469
YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER!
WHERE IS SHE?

22:16.503 --> 22:19.439
OH.

22:19.472 --> 22:21.408
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL BABY.

22:21.441 --> 22:22.975
THAT'S RIGHT.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.612
BUT YOUR ROSIE'S
ALL GROWN UP.

22:25.645 --> 22:28.047
YOU HELD HER
AT HER CHRISTENING.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.117
YOU TOOK HER
TO HER FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.

22:31.150 --> 22:33.386
WELL, SHE'S LOST.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.488
SHE NEEDS YOUR HELP, FRANK.

22:35.522 --> 22:37.457
ONLY YOU CAN HELP HER.

22:40.427 --> 22:42.395
DON'T I KNOW YOU?
WERE YOU IN THE NAVY?

22:42.429 --> 22:44.497
NO, I'M YOUR SON-IN-LAW!

22:44.531 --> 22:45.598
GENO!

22:45.632 --> 22:48.167
WHAT ARE YOU,
READY FOR ANOTHER JOB?

22:48.200 --> 22:49.869
FRANK, LISTEN TO ME.

22:49.902 --> 22:52.104
WE SAW THE HUNDRED "G"
IN YOUR SUITCASE.

22:52.138 --> 22:53.506
WHAT WAS IT FOR?

22:53.540 --> 22:55.675
I GOTTA--
I GOTTA PAY THE GUY.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.444
I LOST HIS JEWELS.

22:57.477 --> 22:59.946
RIGHT.
WHO?

22:59.979 --> 23:01.914
WELL, HE'S--
HE'S PISSED OFF.

23:01.948 --> 23:05.552
HE SAYS HE'LL HURT ROSIE.

23:05.585 --> 23:08.421
I GOTTA FIND A GIRL.

23:08.455 --> 23:10.823
I'VE ONLY GOT
TWO MORE NIGHTS IN PORT.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.127
(Cragen)
I PULLED EVERY JEWEL ROBBERY

23:15.161 --> 23:17.464
IN THE LAST YEAR.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.566
FOUND ONLY ONE MAJOR HEIST.
3/4 OF A MIL.

23:19.599 --> 23:22.569
750 GRAND.
JUST LIKE FRANK SAID.

23:22.602 --> 23:25.472
IT'S GOT TO BE THE SAME JOB
HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

23:25.505 --> 23:27.474
THAT'S AMAZING.

23:27.507 --> 23:29.141
MY WHOLE LIFE, I NEVER MADE
A SCORE HALF THIS RICH.

23:29.175 --> 23:30.877
YEAH, I'M GONNA PRETEND
YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.845
THE REPORT SAYS THE PERP
ENTERED THE BROWNSTONE

23:32.879 --> 23:34.681
THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR,

23:34.714 --> 23:36.483
GOT INTO THE SAFE
WITHIN HALF AN HOUR,

23:36.516 --> 23:37.584
DIDN'T TRIGGER
ANY ALARMS,

23:37.617 --> 23:39.151
AND THEN LEFT
OUT THE BACK WINDOW.

23:39.185 --> 23:41.488
NO PRINTS, NO EVIDENCE.

23:41.521 --> 23:43.556
ONLY GOT ONE WITNESS
SAID HE SAW A MAN IN BLACK

23:43.590 --> 23:45.124
GOING THROUGH
THE WINDOW.

23:45.157 --> 23:47.560
SAME WAY ROSIE
WAS TAKEN.

23:47.594 --> 23:48.928
IT'S GOTTA BE
THE SAME GUY.

23:48.961 --> 23:50.162
HE GIVES THE JEWELRY
FOR FRANK TO FENCE.

23:50.196 --> 23:52.198
FRANK SCREWS UP, CAN'T REMEMBER
WHERE HE STASHES THE LOOT.

23:52.231 --> 23:55.001
WHEN THE JEWEL THIEF
COMES BACK FOR HIS BIG PAYDAY,

23:55.034 --> 23:56.536
FRANK CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
WHO HE IS

23:56.569 --> 23:57.604
OR WHERE THE JEWELRY IS.

23:57.637 --> 23:59.839
THEN FRANK RUNS AND HIDES
WHEN HE HEARS THE THIEF

23:59.872 --> 24:01.508
TRASHING HIS PLACE
LOOKING FOR HIS STUFF.

24:01.541 --> 24:02.775
WHEN HE DOESN'T FIND IT,

24:02.809 --> 24:04.143
HE STEALS MY DAUGHTER.

24:04.176 --> 24:05.878
YOU KNOW, MAYBE FRANK
GOT A RANSOM CALL

24:05.912 --> 24:07.547
IN A MOMENT OF LUCIDITY,

24:07.580 --> 24:08.881
AND THAT'S WHY
HE HAD THE 100 GRAND.

24:08.915 --> 24:10.517
HE WAS WAITING
FOR INSTRUCTIONS.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.619
SO WHAT, WE WAITING
FOR THE PHONE TO RING?

24:12.652 --> 24:14.787
NO.

24:14.821 --> 24:16.055
WE TRY AND CRACK
THE JEWEL HEIST,

24:16.088 --> 24:17.590
FIND THE KIDNAPPER.

24:17.624 --> 24:19.526
CALL FRANK'S DAUGHTER,
TELL HER WHAT HAPPENED.

24:19.559 --> 24:21.060
MAYBE SHE CAN LET US KNOW
HOW HE SCROUNGED UP

24:21.093 --> 24:23.195
100 GRAND
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

24:23.229 --> 24:24.531
[knocking]

24:24.564 --> 24:26.232
(Frank)
HEY, SOMEBODY.

24:26.265 --> 24:29.001
MAYDAY.

24:29.035 --> 24:31.971
GOTTA TAKE A LEAK.

24:32.004 --> 24:33.940
(Huang)
HE NEEDS TO REST
BEFORE YOU GO AT HIM AGAIN.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.274
WELL, I'M RUNNING
OUT OF TIME HERE.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.544
THE MORE TIRED HE IS,
THE LESS COGENT HE'LL BE.

24:37.577 --> 24:38.845
I'LL CALL A FRIEND
AT THE V.A.

24:38.878 --> 24:40.613
ABOUT GETTING FRANK
INTO CARE.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.248
SO SOME GOVERNMENT DOC CAN STOP
ME FROM INTERVIEWING HIM?

24:42.281 --> 24:44.517
NO, FRANK STAYS HERE
UNTIL I GET A LEAD.

24:44.551 --> 24:46.052
(Liz)
DETECTIVE STABLER.

24:46.085 --> 24:47.720
I GOTTA TALK TO YOU.

24:47.754 --> 24:49.522
OKAY.

24:49.556 --> 24:51.824
WHAT IS MY DADDY
DOING HERE?

24:51.858 --> 24:53.793
GETS YOUR HANDS OFF MY FATHER,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

24:53.826 --> 24:54.994
HEY, I'VE DONE MORE
FOR YOUR FATHER

24:55.027 --> 24:56.228
THAN YOU EVER HAVE.

24:56.262 --> 24:57.564
HONEY, DON'T TALK TO
YOUR HUSBAND LIKE THAT.

24:57.597 --> 24:58.865
HE IS NOT MY HUSBAND
ANYMORE.

24:58.898 --> 25:01.233
WELL, AT LEAST I STAYED HOME
WHEN I WAS.

25:01.267 --> 25:02.669
WHERE'S DOUCHE BAG PETE, HUH?

25:02.702 --> 25:03.736
AT LEAST ROSIE
DIDN'T GO MISSING

25:03.770 --> 25:04.971
ON MY WATCH.

25:05.004 --> 25:05.972
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU TOOK HER,
YOU PERVERT.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.574
I WOULD NEVER HURT HER,

25:07.607 --> 25:08.908
YOU RANCID BITCH!

25:08.941 --> 25:10.843
YOUR FIRST RESPONSE
IS ALWAYS WITH YOUR FIST.

25:10.877 --> 25:12.545
THINK OF YOUR DAUGHTER.

25:12.579 --> 25:14.180
LET'S TAKE A WALK.

25:14.213 --> 25:15.815
YOU JUST COME HERE
TO RILE HIM UP,

25:15.848 --> 25:17.116
OR ARE YOU GONNA HELP US
WITH YOUR FATHER?

25:17.149 --> 25:18.718
I CAME HERE FOR THIS.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.286
(male voice)
YOU HAVE ONE HOUR

25:20.319 --> 25:21.988
TO BRING ME $100,000

25:22.021 --> 25:24.223
IN UNMARKED BILLS
OR I KILL THE LITTLE GIRL,

25:24.256 --> 25:26.258
SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY.

25:26.292 --> 25:29.662
THE TUNNEL
OFF WEST 90th,

25:29.696 --> 25:30.930
CENTRAL PARK.

25:30.963 --> 25:33.165
WHEN DID YOU GET THIS?

25:33.199 --> 25:35.802
RIGHT AFTER
DETECTIVE STABLER CALLED.

25:35.835 --> 25:37.804
LIKE 20 MINUTES AGO.

25:37.837 --> 25:40.673
I RAN RIGHT OVER.

25:40.707 --> 25:43.275
I DON'T--I DON'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF MONEY.

25:43.309 --> 25:44.644
(Frank)
I DO.

25:44.677 --> 25:47.246
I WAS GONNA USE IT
TO BRIBE THE MP,

25:47.279 --> 25:48.648
BUT YOUS CAN HAVE IT.

25:48.681 --> 25:50.950
I HATE TO SEE
A CUTE DAME CRY.

25:50.983 --> 25:53.019
THANKS, DAD.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.887
WELL, WE GOT 40 MINUTES
TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.255
HOW DO YOU WANT
TO PLAY IT?

25:56.288 --> 25:57.924
CLOSE TO THE VEST.

26:02.294 --> 26:03.763
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY, LIZ.

26:03.796 --> 26:06.599
WE'RE GONNA GET
YOUR DAUGHTER BACK.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.835
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING TO ME.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.202
I KNOW.

26:10.236 --> 26:13.072
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO DO
EXACTLY WHAT WE TELL YOU.

26:13.105 --> 26:17.109
NOW, YOU'RE GONNA WEAR THIS
IN YOUR EAR

26:17.143 --> 26:19.679
SO YOU CAN HEAR
OUR INSTRUCTIONS.

26:19.712 --> 26:20.880
OKAY?

26:20.913 --> 26:22.615
NOW IF ANYTHING
GOES WRONG,

26:22.649 --> 26:24.651
I WANT YOU TO SCRATCH YOUR EAR
WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND, OKAY?

26:24.684 --> 26:26.018
THAT WAY WE'LL
COME RUSHING IN.

26:26.052 --> 26:27.687
WRONG?
WHAT COULD GO WRONG?

26:27.720 --> 26:30.890
NOTHING AS LONG AS
YOU STAY CALM AND FOCUSED.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.792
NOW, THIS MICROPHONE
WILL PICK UP EVERYTHING.

26:32.825 --> 26:35.895
SO I NEED YOU
TO SAY SOMETHING.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.730
THANK YOU.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.391
ELLIOT.
EL.

27:05.424 --> 27:07.960
THAT'S GOTTA BE HIM.

27:11.430 --> 27:13.733
LIZ, STAY CALM

27:13.766 --> 27:15.234
AND HEAD INTO
THE TUNNEL.

27:15.267 --> 27:17.804
THE KIDNAPPER'S WEARING
A DARK HOODED PARKA.

27:24.443 --> 27:28.080
(Cragen)
HEAD'S UP.
LIZ JUST ENTERED MY SIDE.

27:31.918 --> 27:35.054
(Benson)
THERE'S NO VISUAL
ON OUR SIDE OF THE TUNNEL.

27:38.290 --> 27:40.960
(Cragen)
THE SUSPECT'S COMING OUT
ON MY SIDE.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.028
STAND BY.

27:47.399 --> 27:48.935
I DON'T LIKE THIS.

27:48.968 --> 27:51.303
LIZ, SAY SOMETHING
IF YOU CAN, ANYTHING.

27:51.337 --> 27:52.805
JUST LET US KNOW
THAT YOU'RE OKAY.

27:52.839 --> 27:54.306
I'LL GRAB THE KIDNAPPER.
YOU RUSH THE TUNNEL.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.341
EVERYBODY IN.

27:55.374 --> 27:56.675
LIZ, TALK TO ME.

27:59.045 --> 28:00.479
HEY, HEY, LET GO OF ME.
WHERE'S THE MONEY?

28:00.512 --> 28:04.483
WHAT, THE GUY ONLY GAVE ME
20 BUCKS TO GO IN THERE.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.385
BUT I'M KEEPING IT.

28:06.418 --> 28:07.954
LIZ, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

28:07.987 --> 28:10.723
WHERE ARE YOU?

28:10.757 --> 28:12.892
LIZ, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

28:12.925 --> 28:14.160
I'M SORRY, OLIVIA,
I HAD TO RUN.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.729
KEEP HER TALKING.
I'LL GET THE BOLT CUTTERS.

28:16.763 --> 28:18.097
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO RUN?

28:18.130 --> 28:20.466
BECAUSE I FOUND
THOSE JEWELS

28:20.499 --> 28:22.869
IN MY DAD'S BOX
OF ALL BRAN.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.771
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS
SUPPOSED TO FENCE THEM.

28:24.804 --> 28:25.772
WHERE ARE THEY?

28:25.805 --> 28:27.206
THEY'RE GONE,

28:27.239 --> 28:29.041
TO PAY PETE'S GAMBLING DEBT
OR THEY'D KILL HIM.

28:29.075 --> 28:30.209
BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH.

28:30.242 --> 28:31.911
PETE MADE THE RANSOM CALL?

28:31.944 --> 28:34.146
WE NEED THE MONEY
TO GET OUTTA TOWN.

28:34.180 --> 28:36.148
LIZ!
LIZ, WHAT ABOUT ROSIE?

28:36.182 --> 28:38.417
IF I GO TO PRISON,
I WON'T SEE HER UNTIL SHE'S 30.

28:38.450 --> 28:40.486
DON'T DO THIS.

28:40.519 --> 28:41.520
JUST TELL HER
I LOVE HER.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.089
LIZ, STOP!
COME BACK HERE.

28:43.122 --> 28:45.124
COME BACK HERE!

28:48.861 --> 28:49.962
JUST GOT A LEAD
OFF THE AMBER ALERT.

28:49.996 --> 28:51.764
SIGHTING OF ROSIE
BY A SECURITY GUARD

28:51.798 --> 28:52.865
AT A MALL UPSTATE.

28:52.899 --> 28:54.300
I'M ON IT.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.035
YOU DIG UP ANYTHING
ON LIZ AND PETE?

28:56.068 --> 28:57.403
I CHECKED
THEIR FINANCIALS.

28:57.436 --> 28:59.405
THEY'RE SMART ENOUGH
NOT TO USE THEIR CREDIT CARDS.

28:59.438 --> 29:01.941
WITH 100K,
THEY WON'T HAVE TO.

29:01.974 --> 29:03.776
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED?
WHERE'S ROSIE?

29:03.810 --> 29:05.778
[clears throat]

29:05.812 --> 29:07.413
OH, DON'T TELL ME
YOU BOTCHED THE DROP.

29:07.446 --> 29:09.916
IT WAS A SETUP.

29:09.949 --> 29:12.151
LIZ DISAPPEARED DOWN
A STORM DRAIN WITH THE RANSOM.

29:12.184 --> 29:13.519
YOU KNOW THAT
SON OF A BITCH PETE?

29:13.552 --> 29:15.321
HE WORKS FOR
THE SEWER DEPARTMENT.

29:15.354 --> 29:17.857
SO THEY GOT ROSIE?

29:17.890 --> 29:20.159
KIDNAP'S FOR REAL.

29:20.192 --> 29:22.028
LOOKS LIKE LIZ RIPPED OFF
FRANK FOR THE JEWELS,

29:22.061 --> 29:23.796
AND WHEN THE THIEF
COULDN'T GET HIS MONEY

29:23.830 --> 29:24.931
HE SNATCHED ROSIE
FOR COLLATERAL.

29:24.964 --> 29:26.866
I TOLD YOU SHE WAS
A NO-GOOD BITCH.

29:26.899 --> 29:28.367
SO THIS SCUMBAG'S
GOT MY DAUGHTER?

29:28.400 --> 29:29.568
NOW WHAT?

29:29.601 --> 29:30.870
WE WORK FRANK
FOR THE NAME OF THE THIEF.

29:30.903 --> 29:32.171
FRANK BARELY KNOWS
HIS OWN NAME.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.877
DO YOU KNOW WHERE WE COULD
FIND SOME OF FRANK'S FRIENDS?

29:37.910 --> 29:39.178
MOST OF THEM ARE ALL DEAD,
AND THE ONES WHO AREN'T

29:39.211 --> 29:41.981
ARE UP AT FISHKILL
MAKING LICENSE PLATES.

29:42.014 --> 29:43.883
THERE WAS AN OLD-TIMER
AT FRANK'S PAWN SHOP.

29:43.916 --> 29:44.817
UM, EDDY.

29:44.851 --> 29:46.152
EDDY MACK?
YEAH.

29:46.185 --> 29:47.920
HE'S NO FRIEND.
HE'S COMPETITION.

29:47.954 --> 29:48.955
THAT OLD GUY'S
A TEN PERCENTER.

29:48.988 --> 29:50.289
WHAT'S THAT?

29:50.322 --> 29:51.958
HE'S A RETIRED THIEF
WHO TIPS OFF YOUNGER GUYS

29:51.991 --> 29:53.459
ABOUT EASY JOBS.

29:53.492 --> 29:55.294
FOR THAT INFO,
HE GETS 10% OF THE TAKE.

29:55.327 --> 29:56.829
WELL, WOULD HE HAVE
HIS EAR TO THE GROUND

29:56.863 --> 29:58.330
FOR RICH WOMEN
WITH A LOT OF ROCKS?

29:58.364 --> 30:00.833
WELL, HE'S NOT GONNA MISS
AN EASY SCORE.

30:00.867 --> 30:03.802
YEAH, HE'D KNOW WHO DID
THAT JEWEL HEIST.

30:04.971 --> 30:06.906
BUT HE WON'T TELL YOU.

30:12.945 --> 30:14.213
(Stabler)
ABOUT THE ONLY THING

30:14.246 --> 30:16.082
THESE GUYS COULD STEAL
ARE WALKERS AND CANES.

30:16.115 --> 30:17.917
EVERYONE OF THESE GUYS
WOULD CUT YOUR HEART OUT

30:17.950 --> 30:20.920
AND SELL IT
FOR A BUCK.

30:20.953 --> 30:24.090
HEY THERE,
BASEBALL FAN.

30:24.123 --> 30:26.993
YOU BRING THE COPS
DOWN HERE, GENO?

30:27.026 --> 30:28.294
WHAT ARE YOU, NUTS?

30:28.327 --> 30:29.628
MY DAUGHTER'S IN TROUBLE.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.864
SO IS FRANK.
HE'S SICK.

30:31.898 --> 30:33.365
HE'S SICK.

30:33.399 --> 30:36.135
WE ALL HAVE THOSE
SENIOR MOMENTS.

30:36.168 --> 30:38.104
HIS MIND IS SHOT.

30:38.137 --> 30:40.339
HE SCREWED UP A JOB,
AND HE GOT MY DAUGHTER

30:40.372 --> 30:41.540
KIDNAPPED AS PAYBACK.

30:41.573 --> 30:42.641
CAN'T HELP YOU, GENO.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.476
LOOK, ALL WE NEED
IS A NAME.

30:44.510 --> 30:47.646
THERE'S NO TESTIFYING.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.181
I NEVER SANG
IN MY LIFE.

30:49.215 --> 30:50.449
YOU WANT ME
TO START NOW?

30:50.482 --> 30:52.484
PLEASE, EDDY.

30:52.518 --> 30:53.619
IT'S MY KID
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

30:53.652 --> 30:56.155
I CAN'T HELP YOU,
BUDDY.

30:56.188 --> 30:59.992
I'M A RETIRED BUS DRIVER
ON A PENSION.

31:00.026 --> 31:02.028
EDDY.

31:02.061 --> 31:03.930
DON'T "EDDY" ME, OKAY?

31:03.963 --> 31:08.167
JUST DON'T "EDDY" ME.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.002
YOU BRING HIM IN HERE.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.670
HEY, LOOK.

31:11.703 --> 31:14.473
LOOK AT THIS PAPER.

31:14.506 --> 31:17.109
THAT BLACK SENATOR LADY
FROM ILLINOIS,

31:17.143 --> 31:19.946
THEY SAY SHE USED
TO BE A PROFESSOR

31:19.979 --> 31:22.114
AND WILL ONLY DRINK
FROM A GLASS.

31:22.148 --> 31:23.415
[chuckles]

31:23.449 --> 31:25.617
AIN'T THAT SOMETHING?

31:27.954 --> 31:31.924
LET'S GO.

31:31.958 --> 31:33.159
ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

31:33.192 --> 31:35.661
HE JUST GAVE US
WHAT WE NEEDED.

31:35.694 --> 31:39.098
I DON'T SEE IT.

31:39.131 --> 31:43.302
HE WAS TALKING IN CODE.
WE JUST GOTTA CRACK IT.

31:43.335 --> 31:46.205
THIS IS THE SAFE
THE JEWELS WERE IN.

31:46.238 --> 31:48.274
IT'S A MOSLEY.

31:48.307 --> 31:50.276
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE UNCRACKABLE.

31:50.309 --> 31:53.579
CAROL MOSLEY BRAUN,
THAT'S THE ILLINOIS SENATOR.

31:53.612 --> 31:55.114
I DON'T THINK SHE WAS
A PROFESSOR THOUGH.

31:55.147 --> 31:59.051
I KNOW SOMEONE WHO IS.

31:59.085 --> 32:00.386
GUY NAMED ROY BATTERS.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.955
TEACHES ENGINEERING
AT HUDSON.

32:02.989 --> 32:04.556
HE'S THE NUMBER ONE
SAFECRACKER

32:04.590 --> 32:06.058
IN THE COUNTRY.

32:06.092 --> 32:07.326
BUT THEN WHAT DID
EDDY MEAN BY,

32:07.359 --> 32:11.163
"WILL ONLY DRINK
FROM A GLASS"?

32:11.197 --> 32:14.033
I'M GONNA ASK
THE PROFESSOR.

32:19.605 --> 32:22.041
PROFESSOR BATTERS?

32:22.074 --> 32:24.376
$100,000 EDUCATION AND
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO KNOCK.

32:24.410 --> 32:25.711
OH, YOU'RE NOT STUDENTS.

32:25.744 --> 32:28.680
WE'RE HERE FOR A LITTLE
ADULT EDUCATION.

32:28.714 --> 32:29.982
OH, THE CONSTABULARY.

32:30.016 --> 32:33.652
THAT INTRODUCES
AN AIR OF MYSTERY.

32:33.685 --> 32:35.187
WHAT WOULD YOU WANT
WITH ME?

32:35.221 --> 32:37.756
I TEACH
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.725
WITH A MINOR
IN HIGH-END JEWEL HEISTS.

32:39.758 --> 32:41.760
WE HEAR THAT YOU KNOW
HOW TO CRACK SAFES.

32:41.793 --> 32:44.263
IF YOU'RE INSINUATING

32:44.296 --> 32:47.366
THAT I'M A THIEF,
THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS.

32:47.399 --> 32:51.337
SAFECRACKING'S JUST
MY LITTLE HOBBY, YOU KNOW.

32:51.370 --> 32:53.472
I RELISH THE CHALLENGE
OF PENETRATING

32:53.505 --> 32:55.507
THE IMPENETRABLE.

32:55.541 --> 32:57.576
HOW DO YOU PENETRATE THAT?

32:57.609 --> 33:00.646
NICE TRY, GENTLEMEN.

33:00.679 --> 33:03.682
BUT YOU CAN'T TRICK
OLD ROY BATTERS.

33:03.715 --> 33:05.417
WHAT TRICK?

33:05.451 --> 33:08.754
THIS MOSLEY SAFE DOESN'T
COME WITH GLASS PANELS.

33:08.787 --> 33:10.689
IT'S BEEN MODIFIED.
THAT'S RIGHT.

33:10.722 --> 33:12.524
AN AVERAGE THIEF
WOULD TRY TO DRILL

33:12.558 --> 33:15.361
INTO THIS SAFE THINKING
IT'S A GARDEN-VARIETY MOSLEY,

33:15.394 --> 33:17.429
AND WHEN HE HITS
THE PANELS,

33:17.463 --> 33:21.100
THE SAFE LOCKS DOWN,
MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO OPEN.

33:21.133 --> 33:22.601
WELL, SOMEBODY
FIGURED IT OUT

33:22.634 --> 33:24.536
AND MADE OFF WITH
3/4 OF A MILLION IN DIAMONDS.

33:24.570 --> 33:25.404
YEAH?

33:25.437 --> 33:27.373
THERE ARE ONLY
THREE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD

33:27.406 --> 33:29.775
WHO HAVE THE TALENT
TO GET INSIDE THAT SAFE.

33:29.808 --> 33:32.078
WHAT ARE THEIR NAMES?

33:32.111 --> 33:34.313
WELL, I CAN'T GET INVOLVED.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.082
YOU CAN'T OR YOU WON'T?
A LITTLE OF BOTH.

33:36.115 --> 33:38.784
I MEAN, GENTLEMEN,
LIKE I SAID,

33:38.817 --> 33:41.787
I'M A HOBBYIST AMONG
A BUNCH OF CRIMINALS.

33:41.820 --> 33:44.056
IF ANY OF THEM FOUND OUT
I SQUEALED,

33:44.090 --> 33:46.325
YOU KNOW
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.694
WHOEVER CRACKED THAT SAFE
KIDNAPPED THIS GIRL.

33:48.727 --> 33:50.262
YOU DON'T HELP US,
SHE DIES.

33:52.098 --> 33:54.133
THAT'S WHAT ELSE
WILL HAPPEN.

33:56.168 --> 33:57.503
NEEDLESS TO SAY,

33:57.536 --> 34:00.372
I AM ONE OF THE TALENTED FEW
WHO COULD CRACK IT.

34:00.406 --> 34:04.843
SECOND IS MY MENTOR,
BUT HE'S DEAD.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.112
WHO'S THE THIRD?

34:08.514 --> 34:11.117
MY MENTOR'S SON, JAKE.

34:13.152 --> 34:14.420
POLICE!
SHOW US YOUR HANDS!

34:14.453 --> 34:17.756
YOUR HANDS!

34:17.789 --> 34:19.125
HEY, JAKE.

34:19.158 --> 34:21.193
WHERE'S ROSIE?
GO SCREW YOURSELF.

34:25.164 --> 34:26.632
ROSIE?

34:26.665 --> 34:28.667
ROSIE?

34:32.471 --> 34:33.639
HI, ROSIE.

37:47.899 --> 37:49.368
HE TRIED TO STICK

37:49.401 --> 37:51.036
HE SAID HE WAS GONNA
BLOW MY HEAD OFF.

37:51.069 --> 37:52.904

37:55.541 --> 37:57.676

39:11.182 --> 39:13.585

39:20.692 --> 39:22.661
EDDY MACK.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.463

39:24.496 --> 39:26.998
I HEARD GENO

39:31.537 --> 39:34.105
ROSIE.

39:34.139 --> 39:35.674
GOOD PEOPLE.

39:35.707 --> 39:38.176
MAYBE THIS WILL HELP
A LITTLE BIT.

39:38.209 --> 39:40.011
WHAT'S THIS?

39:48.787 --> 39:50.889
I OWED GENO.

39:50.922 --> 39:53.459
FOR WHAT?

39:53.492 --> 39:57.496
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

39:57.529 --> 39:58.564
I WENT TO HIS HOTEL
TO PAY HIM,

39:58.597 --> 39:59.698
HE SAYS TO BRING IT
TO YOU GUYS.

40:04.470 --> 40:05.904
GOTTA BE $200,000 HERE.

40:05.937 --> 40:07.439
IT'S NOT FOR YOU,
FLATFOOT.

40:07.473 --> 40:08.974
HERE.

40:13.579 --> 40:15.481
"FOR ROSIE.

40:15.514 --> 40:17.082
"PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

40:17.115 --> 40:18.450
LOVE, DAD."

40:20.719 --> 40:23.221
HE ROBBED THAT HOTEL
ON PURPOSE.

40:23.254 --> 40:24.856
HE WANTED TO GO BACK
TO PRISON.

40:24.890 --> 40:28.494
HE THOUGHT SHE'D BE
BETTER OFF WITHOUT HIM.

40:28.527 --> 40:29.761
YEAH, WELL, SOME PEOPLE
CAN DO THEIR TIME

40:29.795 --> 40:32.664
AND THEN WALK OUT
LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED.

40:32.698 --> 40:34.933
OTHER PEOPLE,
THEY DO THEIR TIME,

40:34.966 --> 40:36.635
AND THEY COME OUT,
AND THEY'RE NEVER NORMAL.

40:36.668 --> 40:39.204
YEAH, WELL,
WHAT ABOUT ROSIE?

40:39.237 --> 40:41.940
HE FINALLY REALIZED

40:41.973 --> 40:45.110
SOMETIMES EVEN IF YOU WANT
SOMETHING REAL BAD

40:45.143 --> 40:46.812
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE IT.

40:49.280 --> 40:52.551
LOOK, I GOTTA GO
SEE MY PAL FRANK.

40:52.584 --> 40:56.555
HE'S IN THE BROKEN-DOWN
V.A. HOSPITAL UP IN THE BRONX.

40:56.588 --> 40:59.525
HEY, LOOK, IF YOU NEED
SOMETHING FROM ME

40:59.558 --> 41:01.593
