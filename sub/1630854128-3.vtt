Stay with me.

00:06.571 --> 00:07.833
- So this is how
it's gonna be?

00:07.877 --> 00:09.618
All day long, you've been
talking down to me.

00:09.661 --> 00:11.098
- I should have
given you credit.

00:11.141 --> 00:12.142
I was very impressed
with the way

00:12.186 --> 00:13.796
you nearly killed our patient.

00:13.839 --> 00:15.885

on a number of key supplies.

Stop! Stop! I need that dye.

depleting our supplies.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.767

00:28.811 --> 00:30.726

have a strong hunch

00:30.769 --> 00:33.207

schizoaffective disorder.

Dr. Hawthorne.

00:44.218 --> 00:47.177
My colleague at Med,
David Kwan,

00:47.221 --> 00:49.701
he sings your praises highly.

00:49.745 --> 00:51.529
- Oh, I'm not the doctor.

00:51.573 --> 00:53.749
I'm her assistant, Katherine.

00:53.792 --> 00:55.055
- Okay.

00:55.098 --> 00:57.753
- Sign and date
these forms, please.

01:01.844 --> 01:04.238
Just wherever you see
a highlight.

01:07.154 --> 01:08.459
While you're
finishing up with that,

01:08.503 --> 01:11.245
I'll go over our
policies and procedures.

01:13.856 --> 01:15.553
Everything you discuss
with Dr. Hawthorne

01:15.597 --> 01:17.729
is confidential,
except in the event she feels

01:17.773 --> 01:19.340
you're a danger to yourself.
- You know what, Katherine?

01:19.383 --> 01:21.385
I'm--I'm actually a
practicing psychiatrist myself,

01:21.429 --> 01:24.693

you can skip that part.

01:24.736 --> 01:25.998

01:26.042 --> 01:28.479
but Dr. Hawthorne,
who you'll meet next week,

01:28.523 --> 01:31.265
requires we go through
the policies together.

01:31.308 --> 01:33.745
If the doctor feels that you're
a danger to yourself or others,

01:33.789 --> 01:35.573
she's required to report--
- You know what, Katherine?

01:35.617 --> 01:38.185
I appreciate you're just
trying to do your job.

01:38.228 --> 01:42.102
But, um, maybe you could tell
Dr. Hawthorne

01:42.145 --> 01:45.496

a chance

01:45.540 --> 01:48.108

in person, okay?

01:49.152 --> 01:51.502
Um, you know what?

01:51.546 --> 01:56.116
On second thought,
maybe tell her not to bother.

01:57.943 --> 01:58.857
Yeah.

some names?

two experiences,

02:11.479 --> 02:13.785
my interest in the process
might be waning.

02:13.829 --> 02:16.614
I mean, this morning
in particular

02:16.658 --> 02:18.877
actually had me questioning
the state of psychiatry.

02:18.921 --> 02:21.184
- Well, that
assembly-line mentality

02:21.228 --> 02:23.230

of medicine these days,

02:23.273 --> 02:24.709
not just psychiatry.

02:24.753 --> 02:27.277
But don't worry,
you'll find your person.

morning walking the staff

02:36.417 --> 02:37.809

as Maggie Lockwood on that?

She's in Paris.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.903
She and Ben never
took their honeymoon,

02:44.947 --> 02:47.297

lose her vacation days.

02:47.341 --> 02:48.994

- Yeah.

02:49.038 --> 02:50.170

02:50.213 --> 02:51.214

Is your husband all right?

He's just a bit shaken up.

look at you, okay, honey?

my DNA so they can clone me.

on this billboard.

selling car insurance.

That's essentially a tear
in the wall of his aorta.

have a heart attack?

This particular tear

this man on a billboard

05:28.763 --> 05:30.417
was after him?

05:30.460 --> 05:32.462

a delusion of persecution.

David is still there.

these episodes will become

06:24.166 --> 06:26.168
less severe and less frequent.

06:26.211 --> 06:28.910

06:30.390 --> 06:33.436

- So let me get this straight.

39:24.449 --> 39:27.277
You gave the patient
an antibiotic

39:27.321 --> 39:29.279
you knew she was allergic to--

39:29.323 --> 39:31.891
- Only after I advised her
of the potential risks

39:31.934 --> 39:33.632
and with her full consent.

39:33.675 --> 39:35.938
- Which, trust me,
wouldn't hold up in court

39:35.982 --> 39:38.550
if this thing
had gone sideways.

39:38.593 --> 39:40.595
- Well, Ms. Goodwin,
it wasn't my first choice.

39:40.639 --> 39:42.989
- I understand
the new protocols got off

39:43.032 --> 39:44.817
to a bit of a rocky start
today, but--

39:44.860 --> 39:47.080
- They're not working.

39:47.123 --> 39:48.647
I have no doubt
they were designed

39:48.690 --> 39:49.952
with the best of intentions,

39:49.996 --> 39:51.084
but as your boots
on the ground,

39:51.127 --> 39:52.302
I have to give it
to you straight.

39:52.346 --> 39:54.609
- Let me give it
to youstraight.

39:54.653 --> 39:59.048
These supply chain issues are
not gonna resolve anytime soon,

39:59.092 --> 40:02.051
and not for lack of trying
on my part.

40:02.095 --> 40:06.447
So as imperfect as these
new protocols may be,

40:06.491 --> 40:12.584
we need some sort of semblance
of order in the ED.

40:12.627 --> 40:16.501
I can't have it turning
into the Wild West!

40:18.328 --> 40:21.506
- Honestly, Ms. Goodwin,
I think we're already there.
