WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:04.308
.

00:04.352 --> 00:05.483
- Move the CR!

00:05.527 --> 00:06.528
Stay with me.

00:06.571 --> 00:07.833
- So this is how
it's gonna be?

00:07.877 --> 00:09.618
All day long, you've been
talking down to me.

00:09.661 --> 00:11.098
- I should have
given you credit.

00:11.141 --> 00:12.142
I was very impressed
with the way

00:12.186 --> 00:13.796
you nearly killed our patient.

00:13.839 --> 00:15.885
[suspenseful music]

00:15.928 --> 00:20.411
- We are running low
on a number of key supplies.

00:20.455 --> 00:22.674
- No, no, no, no, no!
Stop! Stop! I need that dye.

00:22.718 --> 00:25.938
- We can't have one patient
depleting our supplies.

00:25.982 --> 00:27.027
- So call into the hospital.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.767
- We're all in the same boat.

00:28.811 --> 00:30.726
- Dr. Cuevas and I
have a strong hunch

00:30.769 --> 00:33.207
that David is developing
schizoaffective disorder.

00:33.250 --> 00:35.035
- No! My boy isn't crazy.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.514
Stay away from us.

00:36.558 --> 00:39.213
- How is that boy
supposed to get any help?

00:40.779 --> 00:42.303
- It is a real pleasure

00:42.346 --> 00:44.174
to finally meet you,
Dr. Hawthorne.

00:44.218 --> 00:47.177
My colleague at Med,
David Kwan,

00:47.221 --> 00:49.701
he sings your praises highly.

00:49.745 --> 00:51.529
- Oh, I'm not the doctor.

00:51.573 --> 00:53.749
I'm her assistant, Katherine.

00:53.792 --> 00:55.055
- Okay.

00:55.098 --> 00:57.753
- Sign and date
these forms, please.

01:01.844 --> 01:04.238
Just wherever you see
a highlight.

01:07.154 --> 01:08.459
While you're
finishing up with that,

01:08.503 --> 01:11.245
I'll go over our
policies and procedures.

01:13.856 --> 01:15.553
Everything you discuss
with Dr. Hawthorne

01:15.597 --> 01:17.729
is confidential,
except in the event she feels

01:17.773 --> 01:19.340
you're a danger to yourself.
- You know what, Katherine?

01:19.383 --> 01:21.385
I'm--I'm actually a
practicing psychiatrist myself,

01:21.429 --> 01:24.693
so, I mean, if you'd like,
you can skip that part.

01:24.736 --> 01:25.998
- I totally get it,

01:26.042 --> 01:28.479
but Dr. Hawthorne,
who you'll meet next week,

01:28.523 --> 01:31.265
requires we go through
the policies together.

01:31.308 --> 01:33.745
If the doctor feels that you're
a danger to yourself or others,

01:33.789 --> 01:35.573
she's required to report--
- You know what, Katherine?

01:35.617 --> 01:38.185
I appreciate you're just
trying to do your job.

01:38.228 --> 01:42.102
But, um, maybe you could tell
Dr. Hawthorne

01:42.145 --> 01:45.496
to give me a call when she has
a chance

01:45.540 --> 01:48.108
to meet me herself
in person, okay?

01:49.152 --> 01:51.502
Um, you know what?

01:51.546 --> 01:56.116
On second thought,
maybe tell her not to bother.

01:57.943 --> 01:58.857
Yeah.

02:02.339 --> 02:03.993
- It's been a long time since

02:04.036 --> 02:05.168
you had to hunt
for a therapist.

02:05.212 --> 02:06.430
Want me to shoot you
some names?

02:06.474 --> 02:08.867
I got a small stockpile
of referrals.

02:08.911 --> 02:09.999
- I gotta be honest, Sharon,

02:10.042 --> 02:11.435
after these last
two experiences,

02:11.479 --> 02:13.785
my interest in the process
might be waning.

02:13.829 --> 02:16.614
I mean, this morning
in particular

02:16.658 --> 02:18.877
actually had me questioning
the state of psychiatry.

02:18.921 --> 02:21.184
- Well, that
assembly-line mentality

02:21.228 --> 02:23.230
is plaguing much
of medicine these days,

02:23.273 --> 02:24.709
not just psychiatry.

02:24.753 --> 02:27.277
But don't worry,
you'll find your person.

02:27.321 --> 02:29.366
See you later.
- No coffee?

02:29.410 --> 02:30.976
- Ugh, no.
I don't have any time.

02:31.020 --> 02:33.675
We're implementing a new
drug shortage protocol,

02:33.718 --> 02:36.373
so I'll be in the ED all
morning walking the staff

02:36.417 --> 02:37.809
through the new guidelines.

02:37.853 --> 02:39.594
- You couldn't get
the enforcer,

02:39.637 --> 02:41.422
otherwise known
as Maggie Lockwood on that?

02:41.465 --> 02:43.206
- [chuckles]
She's in Paris.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.903
She and Ben never
took their honeymoon,

02:44.947 --> 02:47.297
and she was gonna
lose her vacation days.

02:47.341 --> 02:48.994
- Wow.
- Yeah.

02:49.038 --> 02:50.170
- Well, still, not a great time

02:50.213 --> 02:51.214
to be short-staffed,
though, right?

02:51.258 --> 02:52.911
- There's never a good time.

02:52.955 --> 02:55.131
- Yep, you got that right.
- See you later.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.480
[alarm beeps]

02:56.524 --> 02:58.090
- Get these off me!

02:58.134 --> 02:59.353
- David Sullivan,
17-year-old male.

02:59.396 --> 03:01.398
- Oh, we've met.
David, it's me, Dr. Archer.

03:01.442 --> 03:02.704
Do you remember me?
- I can't stay here.

03:02.747 --> 03:04.488
They're gonna find me.
I have to keep moving.

03:04.532 --> 03:06.055
I can't stay in one place!
- It's okay, honey.

03:06.098 --> 03:07.491
You're safe. You're safe.
- He ran naked into the street.

03:07.535 --> 03:09.667
Dad managed to grab him
before he got hit by a car.

03:09.711 --> 03:11.582
No visible injuries
that I can see.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.845
Gave him 0.5
of lorazepam en route.

03:13.889 --> 03:16.239
- Hello, again, Mrs. Sullivan.
Is your husband all right?

03:16.283 --> 03:19.155
- [stammering] He's fine, yeah.
He's just a bit shaken up.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.896
- He drove behind us,
should be here any minute.

03:20.939 --> 03:23.028
- Doris, would you--
- Page psych. I'm on it.

03:23.072 --> 03:24.682
- Okay, finish my sentences
for me, why don't you?

03:24.726 --> 03:27.163
Okay, David, we're gonna
loosen your restraints now

03:27.207 --> 03:28.860
and move you to the bed.

03:28.904 --> 03:30.819
I need you to stay still.

03:30.862 --> 03:33.430
Keep your hands
by your side, all right?

03:33.474 --> 03:34.692
Okay, ready, everybody?

03:34.736 --> 03:38.218
On my count, one, two, three.

03:38.261 --> 03:40.872
Good. Okay.

03:40.916 --> 03:42.526
Very good, okay.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.093
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
- It's all right.

03:44.136 --> 03:45.399
It's all right.
- David, please.

03:45.442 --> 03:47.227
Just let the doctor
look at you, okay, honey?

03:47.270 --> 03:48.663
- They came inside the light.

03:48.706 --> 03:51.883
They're trying to steal
my DNA so they can clone me.

03:51.927 --> 03:53.537
- Okay, so what do you think
could have triggered this?

03:53.581 --> 03:55.322
- We were at a stoplight,

03:55.365 --> 03:57.149
and David became fixated
on this billboard.

03:57.193 --> 03:59.369
It was just some random man
selling car insurance.

03:59.413 --> 04:01.589
- He's not random.
He works for them.

04:01.632 --> 04:03.068
There's a whole network.
- I don't know.

04:03.112 --> 04:04.896
He started taking
his clothes off and telling us

04:04.940 --> 04:07.986
that they were--they were
bugged with recording devices.

04:08.030 --> 04:09.423
And then right when the light
turned green, he bolted.

04:09.466 --> 04:11.686
He ran across four lanes
of oncoming traffic.

04:11.729 --> 04:12.600
There was--

04:12.643 --> 04:14.515
[suspenseful music]

04:14.558 --> 04:16.560
There was a pickup truck
that was coming right at him.

04:16.604 --> 04:18.475
And he--[breathing heavily]
- Eric.

04:18.519 --> 04:19.737
- Sir, are you all right?
- Oh, my God, Eric!

04:19.781 --> 04:21.261
- All right,
let's get him to the ground.

04:21.304 --> 04:22.697
- Eric! Eric!
- Come on.

04:22.740 --> 04:24.002
- What's going on with him?
- It was meant for me.

04:24.046 --> 04:25.308
They're gonna kill us all!
- It's okay, honey.

04:25.352 --> 04:26.614
- Mom, we gotta
get out of here now.

04:26.657 --> 04:27.658
- Let's get a gurney over here!
- It's okay.

04:27.702 --> 04:28.616
- Come on!
- Oh, my God.

04:28.659 --> 04:30.531
- No, no, no! No, no!

04:30.574 --> 04:32.097
- [breathing heavily]

04:32.141 --> 04:36.537
â™ª

04:40.454 --> 04:40.845
.

04:40.889 --> 04:43.674
- Your husband's CT angiogram
showed an aortic dissection.

04:43.718 --> 04:46.721
That's essentially a tear
in the wall of his aorta.

04:46.764 --> 04:48.331
- So Eric didn't
have a heart attack?

04:48.375 --> 04:50.594
- Well, a dissection
can often mimic

04:50.638 --> 04:52.379
heart attacks in presentation.

04:52.422 --> 04:55.556
This particular tear
is very close to his heart,

04:55.599 --> 04:58.689
which is why we need to get him
to surgery as soon as possible

04:58.733 --> 05:00.082
in order to repair it.

05:00.125 --> 05:02.389
- Open heart surgery?
- Mm-hmm, yes.

05:02.432 --> 05:05.087
Dr. Morris, one of our
cardiothoracic surgeons,

05:05.130 --> 05:06.523
will be performing
the operation.

05:06.567 --> 05:08.569
He's on his way here now.

05:08.612 --> 05:10.048
- Oh.

05:10.092 --> 05:12.877
Okay, can I see Eric
before he goes under?

05:12.921 --> 05:14.575
- Yes, of course.

05:14.618 --> 05:16.968
Once we get him to pre-op,
I'll have a nurse come get you.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.103
- How about we go somewhere
and chat for a bit?

05:21.146 --> 05:22.713
- [whispering] Thank you.

05:22.757 --> 05:24.019
Okay.

05:24.062 --> 05:25.542
I don't understand.

05:25.586 --> 05:28.719
Why would David think that
this man on a billboard

05:28.763 --> 05:30.417
was after him?

05:30.460 --> 05:32.462
- It's what we call
a delusion of persecution.

05:32.506 --> 05:36.292
- Yeah, one becomes convinced
that some individual,

05:36.336 --> 05:38.947
you know, or group is
conspiring to harm them

05:38.990 --> 05:40.340
or the people that they love.

05:40.383 --> 05:43.952
- And these delusions,
that's something that

05:43.995 --> 05:45.388
you see with schizophrenia?

05:45.432 --> 05:46.520
- It is, yeah.

05:49.174 --> 05:53.570
- I know Eric and I
weren't exactly receptive

05:53.614 --> 05:54.832
the last time we all spoke.

05:54.876 --> 05:55.964
- We completely understand.

05:56.007 --> 05:57.879
It's--it's a lot to take in.

05:57.922 --> 05:59.446
- I Just thought
that David was going

05:59.489 --> 06:05.060
through some kind of phase,
growing pains, you know?

06:05.103 --> 06:10.282
But in these last couple
of days, it's like he's--

06:10.326 --> 06:14.156
he's lost all touch
with reality.

06:14.199 --> 06:18.203
It's just like,
I feel him slipping away.

06:18.247 --> 06:21.424
- Mrs. Sullivan, I promise you,
David is still there.

06:21.468 --> 06:24.122
- Yeah, and with treatment,
these episodes will become

06:24.166 --> 06:26.168
less severe and less frequent.

06:26.211 --> 06:28.910
- And with proper management,
they can even go away.

06:28.953 --> 06:30.346
- What do you mean, medication?

06:30.390 --> 06:33.436
- That's a crucial component,
yeah.

06:33.480 --> 06:36.439
- David thinks people
are trying to poison him.

06:36.483 --> 06:39.355
How am I going to convince him
to take pills?

06:39.399 --> 06:41.662
- There are actually
injectable versions

06:41.705 --> 06:44.186
of many antipsychotics.

06:44.229 --> 06:45.840
- Though we don't generally
start there.

06:45.883 --> 06:47.232
Those are usually held
in reserve

06:47.276 --> 06:49.017
for non-compliant patients.

06:49.060 --> 06:50.627
- Of course.

06:50.671 --> 06:54.065
I'm just saying, if he refuses
or becomes non-cooperative,

06:54.109 --> 06:56.241
they're an option.
- Right.

06:56.285 --> 06:59.027
But we'll cross that bridge
if and when we get there.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.507
In the long run,
it's just much better

07:00.550 --> 07:03.335
if we can get David on board
with taking medication.

07:03.379 --> 07:05.468
- Okay.

07:08.340 --> 07:10.604
- Ms. Martin, I'm Doctor--
- [gags]

07:10.647 --> 07:14.695
- [spits] Liza.

07:14.738 --> 07:17.480
Sorry, you were saying?

07:17.524 --> 07:19.003
- Uh, I'm Dr. Choi.

07:19.047 --> 07:20.875
I understand you haven't
been feeling well.

07:20.918 --> 07:22.877
- Yeah I can't
keep anything down.

07:22.920 --> 07:25.270
- And you're 12 weeks along.

07:25.314 --> 07:29.318
- Uh, that's just an estimate.

07:29.361 --> 07:33.322
I only just recently
found out I was pregnant.

07:33.365 --> 07:36.325
I haven't gotten around
to see a doctor just yet.

07:36.368 --> 07:39.284
- Well, in that case, we'll go
ahead and run an ultrasound.

07:39.328 --> 07:41.025
Doris, will you mind
grabbing Dr. Asher?

07:41.069 --> 07:43.506
- Sure thing.
- Thanks.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.900
- So when did the vomiting
and diarrhea start?

07:45.943 --> 07:47.118
- Just last night.

07:47.162 --> 07:48.729
- And you haven't
taken any medication?

07:48.772 --> 07:51.471
- No, nothing.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.734
I don't want to take anything
while I'm pregnant.

07:53.777 --> 07:56.084
- Well, you know there are
some nausea medications

07:56.127 --> 07:57.477
that are safe for pregnancy.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.653
- Still, I just--

07:59.696 --> 08:01.350
I would rather not.

08:03.047 --> 08:04.571
I'll be fine.

08:04.614 --> 08:07.530
I just really came in here
to make sure the baby's okay.

08:07.574 --> 08:10.054
- Understood.
Mind if I press on your belly?

08:10.098 --> 08:11.752
I just want to see
if anything feels tender.

08:11.795 --> 08:13.623
- Mm-hmm.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.930
[suspenseful music]

08:15.973 --> 08:17.758
No, no, no. No, no, no.

08:17.801 --> 08:19.586
I don't want her.

08:19.629 --> 08:21.588
You'll have to get me
another doctor.

08:21.631 --> 08:23.154
- Dr. Asher?

08:23.198 --> 08:25.461
- Hannah Asher, right?

08:25.505 --> 08:27.115
- Yeah.
She's an excellent physician.

08:27.158 --> 08:29.726
- She's an addict.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.423
You get me another doctor,
or I'm leaving.

08:31.467 --> 08:32.947
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, okay, okay.

08:32.990 --> 08:33.948
Just hold on a moment.

08:33.991 --> 08:38.561
â™ª

08:38.605 --> 08:42.173
Hey, Hannah, sorry,
I jumped the gun, actually.

08:42.217 --> 08:43.871
We're all good.

08:43.914 --> 08:45.568
- Oh, okay.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.004
Well, in that case,
I'm grabbing breakfast

08:47.048 --> 08:50.225
if anybody's looking for me.

08:57.145 --> 08:59.277
- Dr. Tanaka-Reed,
hold up a minute.

08:59.321 --> 09:01.149
Can you have them
update that for me?

09:01.192 --> 09:02.585
Thank you.

09:02.629 --> 09:05.414
Look, I-- [clears throat]
I wanted to clear the air.

09:05.457 --> 09:09.200
The other day, I may have come
off a little condescending.

09:09.244 --> 09:11.507
- I appreciate the
acknowledgment, Dr. Marcel.

09:11.551 --> 09:15.642
- Of course, and if there's
anything you'd like to say--

09:15.685 --> 09:17.992
- No, don't think so.

09:18.035 --> 09:20.603
We're all good.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.039
- What, you didn't
have time to grab him

09:22.083 --> 09:24.433
flowers from the gift shop?

09:24.476 --> 09:26.217
Huh?

09:26.261 --> 09:27.479
I mean, I expect the other docs

09:27.523 --> 09:30.352
to go soft on the residents.

09:30.395 --> 09:32.180
I thought you had grit.

09:32.223 --> 09:33.790
- Well,
no man's an island, right?

09:33.834 --> 09:35.183
- Aha.

09:35.226 --> 09:36.532
You know, island life's
really not so bad.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.360
Maybe you just don't
have the stomach for it.

09:38.403 --> 09:40.754
- Dr. Marcel, you've got
a trauma incoming.

09:40.797 --> 09:43.017
- Well, thanks for
that pep talk, coach.

09:43.060 --> 09:44.584
- Any time.

09:44.627 --> 09:46.847
- [groaning]

09:46.890 --> 09:48.326
- What do we got?

09:48.370 --> 09:50.764
- Marcus Walker, 50-year-old
male, fall from standing.

09:50.807 --> 09:53.288
Gave him a 500 liter
bolus en route.

09:53.331 --> 09:54.985
Pressure's hanging
around 100, systolic.

09:55.029 --> 09:56.421
Heart rate's 120.

09:56.465 --> 09:58.423
- Yeah, I've never seen him
in this much pain.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.817
It hasn't let up since
he hit the pavement.

10:00.861 --> 10:01.862
- This is his sister, Janet.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.428
- Did you witness
the fall, Janet?

10:03.472 --> 10:04.865
- He lost his balance
stepping off the sidewalk.

10:04.908 --> 10:06.823
It didn't look that bad,
but then he couldn't get up.

10:06.867 --> 10:08.303
- Okay, we'll give him
something for the pain.

10:08.346 --> 10:09.478
We just got to find
the source of it first.

10:09.521 --> 10:10.522
- Any medications
we should know about?

10:10.566 --> 10:11.915
- Dialysis.

10:11.959 --> 10:13.351
Oh, and he takes ramipril
for his blood pressure.

10:13.395 --> 10:14.526
- Okay, here we go, guys.

10:14.570 --> 10:15.876
Nice and easy on my count,
okay?

10:15.919 --> 10:17.617
One, two, three.

10:17.660 --> 10:20.184
- [groans]
- I'm sorry, Marcus.

10:20.228 --> 10:22.622
- I'm right here, Marcus.
I'm right here.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.667
- Janet, let's give the doctor
some room to work, okay?

10:24.711 --> 10:26.582
- We're gonna take care of him,
Janet, we got this.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.975
- Let's hang a unit
of whole blood.

10:28.018 --> 10:29.411
Pressure it in, Ron.

10:29.454 --> 10:32.414
Hey, Marcus, put your arms
by your side for me.

10:32.457 --> 10:34.285
There you go, bud.
Deep breaths.

10:34.329 --> 10:35.678
Okay, lungs are clear.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.419
- He's still shocking.
- Yeah.

10:37.462 --> 10:38.986
He's bleeding from somewhere.

10:39.029 --> 10:40.770
Let's fast him, Dr. Taylor.

10:40.814 --> 10:44.165
[tense music]

10:44.208 --> 10:48.038
â™ª

10:48.082 --> 10:49.474
Belly's negative.

10:49.518 --> 10:51.041
- Really?

10:51.085 --> 10:52.782
- Yeah.

10:52.826 --> 10:54.828
- All right,
let's get him on his side.

10:54.871 --> 10:57.657
Herbert, come over, please.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.702
All right, here we go.
Nice and easy, all right?

10:59.746 --> 11:01.182
One, two, three.

11:01.225 --> 11:02.836
- [groans]

11:02.879 --> 11:04.141
- There you go.
You're doing great.

11:04.185 --> 11:05.926
You're doing great, Marcus.

11:05.969 --> 11:09.930
â™ª

11:09.973 --> 11:11.888
- What is it?

11:11.932 --> 11:12.933
- Oh.

11:12.976 --> 11:14.108
- An abscess.

11:14.151 --> 11:15.109
- Looks like it.

11:15.152 --> 11:16.458
Pus under pressure.

11:16.501 --> 11:18.025
It's gotta be
the source of the pain.

11:18.068 --> 11:20.636
All right, let's drain it.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.768
Scalpel.

11:21.811 --> 11:23.595
[groans]

11:27.774 --> 11:29.558
- Hematoma.

11:36.086 --> 11:37.218
- Yep.

11:37.261 --> 11:39.916
Hold pressure and pack it in.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.135
You got it?
- Yeah.

11:41.178 --> 11:42.527
- Okay.
- Got it.

11:42.571 --> 11:44.486
- All right, give me
another unit of whole blood.

11:44.529 --> 11:48.838
Start DDAVP and a unit
of platelets, stat.

11:48.882 --> 11:50.448
Come on, let's move, folks.

11:57.847 --> 11:58.065
.

11:58.108 --> 11:59.588
- Ms. Arya, hello again.

11:59.631 --> 12:01.242
- Indrani, please.

12:01.285 --> 12:03.984
- Indrani, I got the results
back on your culture.

12:04.027 --> 12:05.550
Unfortunately,
you tested positive

12:05.594 --> 12:07.335
for an infection called MRSA.

12:07.378 --> 12:10.817
- From an ingrown toenail?

12:10.860 --> 12:13.907
MRSA is really hard
to treat, isn't it?

12:13.950 --> 12:16.039
- While it is resistant
to many antibiotics,

12:16.083 --> 12:17.911
luckily, there are a couple
that still work for it.

12:17.954 --> 12:20.043
- How long do I have
to be on antibiotics?

12:20.087 --> 12:21.828
- About seven to ten days.
- Oh.

12:21.871 --> 12:25.048
- See, I told you you wouldn't
have to cancel your trip.

12:25.092 --> 12:26.789
- Oh, yeah?
Where are you headed?

12:26.833 --> 12:28.791
- Well, I'm going to Scotland
in a few weeks

12:28.835 --> 12:30.401
to hike the West Highland Way.

12:30.445 --> 12:33.796
It's a 96-mile trail
through the Scottish Highlands.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.102
- 96 miles?

12:35.145 --> 12:37.321
- I've been training
for the last year.

12:37.365 --> 12:40.107
I may be pushing 60,
but I don't feel it.

12:40.150 --> 12:42.109
- Let's start with vancomycin.

12:42.152 --> 12:44.764
- No, I can't take vancomycin.
I'm allergic.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.330
- Aha, I see that.

12:46.374 --> 12:48.637
- I had a terrible reaction
when I was a kid.

12:48.680 --> 12:49.899
My throat closed up.

12:49.943 --> 12:51.727
- Then we will steer clear.
Nancy?

12:51.771 --> 12:54.121
- Linezolid? On it.
- Mm-hmm.

12:54.164 --> 12:55.905
We'll get you in tip top
shape for Scotland, Indrani.

12:55.949 --> 12:57.951
- I've been wanting
to do this a long time.

12:57.994 --> 13:00.954
- Um, Dr. Halstead,
the pharmacy

13:00.997 --> 13:03.478
won't release the medication.

13:03.521 --> 13:05.306
- What?

13:05.349 --> 13:06.350
- Is there a problem?

13:06.394 --> 13:09.136
[suspenseful music]

13:09.179 --> 13:12.008
- No, just probably
a system glitch.

13:12.052 --> 13:14.141
Sit tight,
and I'll be right back.

13:14.184 --> 13:16.491
- Look, per the new protocol,

13:16.534 --> 13:18.972
you're gonna have to go through
Infectious Disease first.

13:19.015 --> 13:21.670
And they're going to want
to try incising

13:21.713 --> 13:23.324
and draining
the infected tissue

13:23.367 --> 13:25.761
before they approve
giving linezolid.

13:25.805 --> 13:26.849
- Incising and draining?

13:26.893 --> 13:28.329
So source control.

13:28.372 --> 13:29.896
That is not gonna
cut it, Ms. Goodwin.

13:29.939 --> 13:31.767
She needs linezolid.

13:34.161 --> 13:36.163
I mean, can't we just
say that, um,

13:36.206 --> 13:38.992
you know, Infectious Disease
already signed off?

13:39.035 --> 13:40.994
- No, we cannot, Dr. Halstead.

13:41.037 --> 13:43.083
Linezolid is on
the restricted list

13:43.126 --> 13:45.563
due to extremely low inventory.

13:45.607 --> 13:48.262
There's a region-wide shortage.

13:48.305 --> 13:50.830
- And we are dealing
with a systemic MRSA infection.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.658
- You're looking at the patient
in front of you.

13:53.702 --> 13:56.879
But the Oversight Committee
designed the guidelines

13:56.923 --> 14:00.883
to ration these drugs
to the most severe cases.

14:00.927 --> 14:05.845
I have seen early
source control work wonders.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.498
Give it a shot.

14:12.764 --> 14:14.375
- [sighs]
- Dr. Marcel.

14:14.418 --> 14:16.551
- Yeah?
- I got Marcus' CAT scans.

14:16.594 --> 14:17.900
- Uh-huh.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.771
- Two very severe
lumbar burst fractures.

14:19.815 --> 14:21.208
- All from a spill
on the sidewalk?

14:21.251 --> 14:22.252
- Take a look.

14:23.775 --> 14:25.038
- Oof.

14:25.081 --> 14:27.127
Renal disease definitely
sped up his bone loss.

14:27.170 --> 14:29.390
- He's gonna need spinal
stabilization surgery.

14:29.433 --> 14:33.220
- Yeah, agreed, only option
to get him walking again.

14:33.263 --> 14:34.917
Given his co-morbidities,
without it,

14:34.961 --> 14:37.093
he's just
gonna circle the drain.

14:37.137 --> 14:41.054
All right, let's--
let's go talk to neurosurgery.

14:42.446 --> 14:45.362
- And David, this voice
that you're hearing,

14:45.406 --> 14:47.843
is it male or female?

14:47.887 --> 14:49.366
- I don't know.

14:49.410 --> 14:52.239
It's more like
it has its own language,

14:52.282 --> 14:54.197
its own way of communicating.

14:54.241 --> 14:57.070
And then my brain
translates messages

14:57.113 --> 14:59.072
so I can understand them.
- Mm.

14:59.115 --> 15:01.291
Are you getting
any messages right now?

15:01.335 --> 15:03.424
- That you're
writing down everything

15:03.467 --> 15:05.513
I say because
you work for them.

15:07.645 --> 15:10.387
â™ª

15:10.431 --> 15:13.782
You're one of their spies,
aren't you?

15:13.825 --> 15:15.218
- No, I'm not a spy.

15:15.262 --> 15:17.394
- Then give me your notebook.

15:17.438 --> 15:18.874
- I'm not gonna give you
my notebook, David.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.006
- Give it to me.

15:20.049 --> 15:20.963
- David, I need you
to listen to me.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.225
I'm a doctor.

15:22.269 --> 15:23.357
I'm writing things down
so I can

15:23.400 --> 15:24.619
better understand
what's going--

15:24.662 --> 15:26.447
- Get out of here!

15:26.490 --> 15:27.883
Out, now!

15:27.927 --> 15:29.624
- David, David,
how about Dr. Cuevas

15:29.667 --> 15:30.886
puts her notebook away for now.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.106
Would that make you
feel better?

15:33.149 --> 15:37.197
And I notice you've been
checking out this vent.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.459
- There's a camera in there.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.115
- Huh.

15:42.158 --> 15:43.464
- They're always watching me.

15:43.507 --> 15:45.379
- There isn't a camera
in there, David.

15:45.422 --> 15:47.468
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that there isn't.

15:47.511 --> 15:48.860
But, you know, we're--

15:48.904 --> 15:49.949
we're happy to cover it up
if it'll

15:49.992 --> 15:52.647
make you more comfortable.

15:52.690 --> 15:54.127
Okay, good.

15:54.170 --> 15:56.825
So why don't I go see
what I can scrounge up.

15:56.868 --> 15:59.001
And I have another
couple of patients

15:59.045 --> 16:00.481
I need to check in on,
but in the meantime,

16:00.524 --> 16:02.004
is there anything else
I can get you?

16:02.048 --> 16:03.484
- Can I have a Coke?

16:03.527 --> 16:04.528
- Absolutely.

16:06.661 --> 16:08.184
Okay, so back in a bit.

16:08.228 --> 16:11.492
And Dr. Cuevas, can I just
get a quick word, please?

16:11.535 --> 16:18.412
â™ª

16:18.455 --> 16:20.980
So with patients
experiencing paranoia,

16:21.023 --> 16:24.287
I've found that it's probably
not the best idea to push back

16:24.331 --> 16:25.897
too hard on their
version of events,

16:25.941 --> 16:27.987
you know,
especially at the outset.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.858
- There's actually
evidence-based research

16:29.901 --> 16:31.773
suggesting the opposite,

16:31.816 --> 16:34.341
that you shouldn't reinforce
a patient's delusion.

16:34.384 --> 16:35.995
Instead, you should
try to explain to them

16:36.038 --> 16:38.171
why they're experiencing
things differently.

16:38.214 --> 16:39.999
- I hear you,
except that that's

16:40.042 --> 16:42.044
pretty much impossible
if you haven't

16:42.088 --> 16:43.915
first established trust.

16:43.959 --> 16:46.005
But very glad
to hear that you are

16:46.048 --> 16:47.397
keeping up on the literature.

16:47.441 --> 16:49.008
Way to go.

16:49.051 --> 16:54.752
â™ª

16:54.796 --> 16:57.059
- Ooh, got Choi
as your advisor.

16:57.103 --> 16:59.366
Luck really isn't on your side.

16:59.409 --> 17:00.280
- Why?

17:00.323 --> 17:02.021
He's been really cool with me.

17:02.064 --> 17:03.848
- Yeah, well, I wouldn't
get too comfortable.

17:03.892 --> 17:06.068
Word is, he's a real hard-ass.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.157
Got his last resident fired.

17:13.119 --> 17:14.990
- Olga, what are you
doing down here?

17:15.034 --> 17:16.383
- I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

17:16.426 --> 17:18.733
I assumed you were out today.
- Why's that?

17:18.776 --> 17:20.822
- Oh, well, Dr. Choi
asked me to ultrasound

17:20.865 --> 17:21.953
his pregnant patient.

17:24.826 --> 17:27.046
- I don't understand.
Why would he ask you?

17:27.089 --> 17:28.743
I cover the ED.

17:28.786 --> 17:33.095
[tense music]

17:33.139 --> 17:35.141
So do you have a question
about my qualifications

17:35.184 --> 17:37.099
or something?
- Of course not, Hannah.

17:37.143 --> 17:39.145
- Then why would you
ask another obstetrician

17:39.188 --> 17:41.843
to do an ultrasound
in the ED when I'm here?

17:41.886 --> 17:43.584
Obviously, you don't trust me.

17:43.627 --> 17:44.715
- It's not that.

17:44.759 --> 17:46.891
I--
[sighs]

17:46.935 --> 17:49.111
The patient
requested another doctor.

17:49.155 --> 17:52.767
She--she knew about your past.

17:52.810 --> 17:54.073
- What? How?

17:55.813 --> 17:57.250
Does she know me personally?

17:57.293 --> 17:58.555
- She didn't volunteer
that information,

17:58.599 --> 18:00.296
so I didn't press it.
- Fine.

18:00.340 --> 18:02.081
Forget it.
- Hannah.

18:02.124 --> 18:05.997
- I'm just so sick of this
following me everywhere I go.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.608
No matter how much
progress I make,

18:07.651 --> 18:10.176
everyone's still judging me
for who I used to be.

18:10.219 --> 18:15.790
â™ª

18:15.833 --> 18:16.965
- Nope.

18:17.008 --> 18:18.619
Medically, it's just too risky.

18:18.662 --> 18:21.100
Chronic hypertension,
end-stage renal disease--

18:21.143 --> 18:22.753
the list goes on and on
with this patient.

18:22.797 --> 18:24.407
The real kicker
is that platelet count.

18:24.451 --> 18:27.236
I'm not touching anyone whose
platelet count's below 100k.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.847
- Listen, we know that he's
not an ideal candidate.

18:29.891 --> 18:31.153
- Oh, wait, I almost forgot.

18:31.197 --> 18:33.112
You guys also hacked
his back open in the ED,

18:33.155 --> 18:35.201
making a posterior
approach impossible.

18:35.244 --> 18:36.637
Should I go on?

18:36.680 --> 18:38.769
- Look, I can give you
great anterior exposure.

18:38.813 --> 18:40.641
All you have to do
is stabilize his spine.

18:40.684 --> 18:42.164
I'll take care
of everything else.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.775
- Oh, you'd be
assisting me on this one?

18:44.819 --> 18:47.648
Wow, way to save your
strongest argument for last.

18:47.691 --> 18:49.780
- Maybe you're just worried
about your stats, Sam.

18:49.824 --> 18:51.782
- [scoffs]

18:51.826 --> 18:53.480
Send him up
to interventional radiology.

18:53.523 --> 18:55.525
Have them inject cement
into his fractures.

18:55.569 --> 18:57.484
That'll at least
get him sitting up.

18:57.527 --> 18:59.181
- But that won't
get him walking.

18:59.225 --> 19:00.791
And lack of movement
is dangerous

19:00.835 --> 19:02.315
in Marcus's condition.

19:02.358 --> 19:04.621
He can develop pressure sores,
blood clots, pneumonia.

19:04.665 --> 19:07.058
- All preferable to him
bleeding out on my table.

19:09.713 --> 19:10.714
- [sighs]

19:13.717 --> 19:16.155
We just need
to get his platelet count up.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.678
- Yeah, it's the only way
to get Marcus

19:17.721 --> 19:19.984
healthy enough for surgery
and Abrams on board.

19:20.028 --> 19:21.638
All right, I'll--

19:21.682 --> 19:24.206
I'll order a couple of units
of platelets, all right?

19:29.080 --> 19:30.343
[knock at door]

19:30.386 --> 19:33.520
- Patty, any updates
on your husband?

19:33.563 --> 19:35.217
- Oh, he just
went into surgery.

19:35.261 --> 19:36.827
Dr. Archer said
it will be a while

19:36.871 --> 19:38.046
before there's any updates.

19:38.089 --> 19:40.048
- Okay, well,
he's in very good hands.

19:40.091 --> 19:41.745
You can trust me on that.

19:41.789 --> 19:44.357
David, got that Coke
you asked for

19:44.400 --> 19:46.359
and some stuff for the vent.

19:46.402 --> 19:49.231
Do you think you might
be up for chatting a bit?

19:52.147 --> 19:53.279
You all right, pal?

19:53.322 --> 19:55.890
[suspenseful music]

19:55.933 --> 19:59.154
- Trini gave him something
just to calm him down.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.286
- Huh.

20:03.114 --> 20:05.769
Okay, back in a second.

20:07.945 --> 20:08.903
- What did you give him?

20:08.946 --> 20:10.513
- 6 of risperidone.

20:10.557 --> 20:11.471
- What?

20:11.514 --> 20:13.473
Who the hell ordered that?

20:13.516 --> 20:14.300
- I did.

20:14.343 --> 20:19.827
â™ª

20:23.570 --> 20:23.787
.

20:23.831 --> 20:26.355
He became extremely agitated
and was resisting restraints.

20:26.399 --> 20:27.835
- Lorazepam worked
this morning.

20:27.878 --> 20:29.402
- You didn't see
how upset he was.

20:29.445 --> 20:30.751
- Haldol then.

20:30.794 --> 20:32.666
- He was going to
tear out his IV.

20:32.709 --> 20:34.058
His mom was freaking out,
begging me to do--

20:34.102 --> 20:35.669
- Well, you cannot
let a family member

20:35.712 --> 20:37.801
pressure you into making
a rushed treatment call.

20:37.845 --> 20:40.761
- It wasn't rushed.
It was necessary.

20:40.804 --> 20:42.893
And besides, the meds
will clear his system

20:42.937 --> 20:44.286
by tomorrow morning
at the latest.

20:44.330 --> 20:45.635
- At which point,
we'll be back at square one

20:45.679 --> 20:47.507
with David,
if we're lucky, all right?

20:47.550 --> 20:50.118
Any trust established,
down the drain.

20:50.161 --> 20:52.294
How about this, in the future,
maybe at least page me

20:52.338 --> 20:55.558
before administering a very
high dose of antipsychotics

20:55.602 --> 20:57.952
to a patient
we're still evaluating?

20:57.995 --> 21:01.129
- With all due respect,
Dr. Charles,

21:01.172 --> 21:03.436
I am not a trainee.

21:03.479 --> 21:06.526
And 6 milligrams is well within
the standard of care, I--

21:06.569 --> 21:08.092
- Standard of care,
whatever that is,

21:08.136 --> 21:10.356
is not some blanket template
you follow

21:10.399 --> 21:13.315
without any regard
for the person in front of you

21:13.359 --> 21:14.664
you're supposed to be helping!

21:14.708 --> 21:17.667
[tense music]

21:17.711 --> 21:24.761
â™ª

21:27.677 --> 21:29.157
- Hey, Janet.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.246
I just want to let you know,
the nurse will be by soon

21:31.290 --> 21:33.466
to start Marcus'
platelet transfusion, okay?

21:33.509 --> 21:36.469
[apprehensive music]

21:36.512 --> 21:40.255
â™ª

21:40.299 --> 21:42.736
I know it's been a rough day.

21:42.779 --> 21:45.782
- More like a rough year.

21:45.826 --> 21:48.481
Lost my husband in January.

21:48.524 --> 21:51.310
- I'm so sorry.

21:51.353 --> 21:54.138
- Marcus came out from
California for the funeral

21:54.182 --> 21:58.360
and just never went home,

21:58.404 --> 21:59.883
moved in with me.

21:59.927 --> 22:01.711
- You must really get on.

22:03.409 --> 22:08.327
- [sniffles] Never had
a choice in the matter.

22:08.370 --> 22:11.155
We're twins, actually.

22:11.199 --> 22:15.377
Marcus was born
45 seconds before me,

22:15.421 --> 22:19.250
but you'd think he was
years older, the way he acts.

22:19.294 --> 22:24.560
Seeing him here like this,
so fragile--

22:27.258 --> 22:29.478
- It's really hard.

22:29.522 --> 22:36.616
â™ª

22:38.618 --> 22:41.969
I want you to know that, uh,

22:42.012 --> 22:47.627
we're gonna do everything
we can for Marcus, I promise.

22:47.670 --> 22:48.889
Okay.

22:53.415 --> 22:55.678
What is it?

22:55.722 --> 22:57.898
- I was just looking back
in Marcus's history.

22:57.941 --> 23:00.074
His platelets
have always been low.

23:00.117 --> 23:01.423
- Huh.

23:01.467 --> 23:02.903
Do you think this is chronic?

23:02.946 --> 23:05.514
Some kind of undiagnosed
blood disorder, or...?

23:05.558 --> 23:07.603
- ITP would be my guess.
- Oh, man.

23:07.647 --> 23:08.822
- And if that's the case,

23:08.865 --> 23:10.127
a transfusion is not
gonna do much.

23:10.171 --> 23:11.564
I mean, his body would just
keep chewing up

23:11.607 --> 23:13.087
any new platelets we give him.

23:13.130 --> 23:15.437
- Well, unless--

23:15.481 --> 23:17.134
- Unless what?

23:18.919 --> 23:22.444
- Um, forget it, actually.

23:22.488 --> 23:23.837
I thought I had something.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.229
But let's just hope
the transfusion

23:25.273 --> 23:28.319
moves the needle a little,
okay?

23:28.363 --> 23:31.279
[suspenseful music]

23:31.322 --> 23:36.240
â™ª

23:36.284 --> 23:39.113
- Podiatry incised
and drained the toe.

23:39.156 --> 23:42.029
They had to cut the nail out.

23:42.072 --> 23:43.813
- I'm not a doctor,
but it looks like

23:43.857 --> 23:44.901
it's getting worse to me.

23:44.945 --> 23:46.903
- Don't worry. I'm on it.

23:46.947 --> 23:48.252
We're gonna get you
the medicine you need.

23:48.296 --> 23:51.778
- Dr. Halstead, can I
speak with you outside?

23:51.821 --> 23:54.476
- What's wrong?

23:54.520 --> 23:56.826
- Just give us a moment.

24:02.441 --> 24:05.052
- We're now completely
out of linezolid.

24:05.095 --> 24:07.620
- You've gotta be kidding me.

24:07.663 --> 24:09.143
I knew it.

24:09.186 --> 24:11.885
I knew source control
wasn't gonna cut it.

24:11.928 --> 24:13.539
How soon are we expecting
to get it back in stock?

24:13.582 --> 24:15.671
- Tomorrow morning,
at the earliest.

24:19.414 --> 24:21.285
- Order vancomycin.

24:21.329 --> 24:22.548
- She's allergic.

24:22.591 --> 24:25.376
- I know, all right,
but I've got an idea.

24:29.032 --> 24:31.470
[knock at door]
- Hey, Liza.

24:33.341 --> 24:35.386
So got your labs back,
and they look good.

24:35.430 --> 24:37.998
Your white blood count
is slightly elevated,

24:38.041 --> 24:40.304
but that's pretty common
in pregnancy.

24:40.348 --> 24:43.220
I think we're just looking
at a stomach bug.

24:43.264 --> 24:44.570
- Makes sense.

24:44.613 --> 24:45.919
I can go home then?

24:45.962 --> 24:48.008
- Yeah, Dr. Patchefsky
sent down a list

24:48.051 --> 24:50.010
of OB-GYN referrals,

24:50.053 --> 24:52.403
as well as some
genetic testing counselors.

24:52.447 --> 24:54.754
We'll just add those
to your discharge.

24:54.797 --> 24:56.669
- Genetic testing?

24:56.712 --> 24:58.453
I thought she said the--

24:58.497 --> 25:01.021
the baby looked healthy
on the ultrasound.

25:01.064 --> 25:03.371
- Genetic testing
for hereditary conditions

25:03.414 --> 25:04.285
is completely optional.

25:05.895 --> 25:09.551
- But the baby's healthy,
right?

25:09.595 --> 25:10.726
- Yeah.

25:12.989 --> 25:14.817
Hey, listen, if--

25:14.861 --> 25:16.515
- Liza, my dear.

25:18.342 --> 25:20.736
I have your
discharge paperwork.

25:25.393 --> 25:28.614
- I'm not sure
I'm following you.

25:28.657 --> 25:32.052
You want to give me a drug
I told you almost killed me?

25:32.095 --> 25:34.358
- And we'll do everything
we can to mitigate the chances

25:34.402 --> 25:36.578
of another adverse reaction.
- How, exactly?

25:36.622 --> 25:39.102
- Through a process
called desensitizing.

25:39.146 --> 25:41.365
We'll pre-medicate you with
steroids and antihistamines

25:41.409 --> 25:44.455
and then administer the
vancomycin via a slow IV drip.

25:44.499 --> 25:47.415
- And can you promise me
that my throat

25:47.458 --> 25:48.634
won't close up again?

25:48.677 --> 25:50.374
- I can't promise that, no.

25:50.418 --> 25:51.985
But if you do
go into anaphylaxis,

25:52.028 --> 25:53.334
we'll have epinephrine
at the ready.

25:53.377 --> 25:54.944
Worst case scenario,
we might need to intubate,

25:54.988 --> 25:56.598
but that would
only be temporary.

25:56.642 --> 25:57.991
- Intubate me? No, no.

25:58.034 --> 25:59.383
I'll go to another hospital.

25:59.427 --> 26:01.211
- Well,
we've called everywhere.

26:01.255 --> 26:02.735
The earliest anyone has
linezolid is tomorrow.

26:02.778 --> 26:04.693
- So I'll wait.

26:04.737 --> 26:07.087
- As you're seeing,
MRSA moves fast.

26:07.130 --> 26:08.436
I am afraid
if we wait until tomorrow,

26:08.479 --> 26:10.307
it will have already
spread to the bone.

26:10.351 --> 26:11.700
You could lose
your leg, Indrani.

26:11.744 --> 26:18.054
â™ª

26:19.447 --> 26:21.449
- Give me the vancomycin.

26:21.492 --> 26:22.450
- Okay.

26:26.585 --> 26:29.762
- Marcus' platelet count rose
from 50,000 to 105,000.

26:29.805 --> 26:30.763
Can you believe it?

26:30.806 --> 26:32.547
- That's great.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.288
- It's fantastic.

26:34.331 --> 26:36.333
He must not have ITP after all.

26:36.377 --> 26:37.596
- Do me a favor.

26:37.639 --> 26:39.598
Show Abrams these updated labs.

26:39.641 --> 26:43.471
I think he'll be more receptive
if you deliver them solo.

26:43.514 --> 26:45.647
- How could he possibly
refuse to operate now?

26:45.691 --> 26:47.431
- It's Abrams.

26:47.475 --> 26:49.172
- I'll get him on board.

26:49.216 --> 26:53.350
- Dr. Choi?
We've got a problem.

26:53.394 --> 26:55.657
Liza?

26:55.701 --> 26:56.745
I thought she had left.

26:56.789 --> 26:57.833
I came in
to turn over the room,

26:57.877 --> 26:59.095
and I found her passed out.

26:59.139 --> 27:00.140
- Let's get her
back in the bed

27:00.183 --> 27:01.271
and up on the monitors.
Ready?

27:01.315 --> 27:03.665
One, two, three.

27:03.709 --> 27:05.798
All right. All right.

27:05.841 --> 27:07.669
Liza?
Liza, can you hear me?

27:07.713 --> 27:09.802
All right, let's re-start
her IV and get a Foley in her.

27:09.845 --> 27:10.977
Grab OB.
- Patchefsky, right?

27:11.020 --> 27:11.978
- No, no, no. No time.

27:12.021 --> 27:13.370
Grab Asher.
- Okay.

27:13.414 --> 27:15.808
- She's hypotensive.
BP 85/43.

27:15.851 --> 27:17.331
Maybe she vasovagaled?

27:17.374 --> 27:19.420
- Her white count was more
significant than I thought.

27:19.463 --> 27:21.727
[alarm beeping]

27:21.770 --> 27:23.337
- Liza.

27:23.380 --> 27:25.644
- You know her?
- Yeah, Doris filled me in.

27:25.687 --> 27:26.906
How long had she
been experiencing symptoms

27:26.949 --> 27:27.994
when she came in?

27:28.037 --> 27:29.256
- Less than 24 hours.

27:29.299 --> 27:31.301
- And that's self-reported
from the patient?

27:31.345 --> 27:32.607
- Yeah, why?

27:32.651 --> 27:36.002
â™ª

27:36.045 --> 27:37.351
- Bolus a liter
of normal saline.

27:37.394 --> 27:38.831
- Hannah, we've been
giving her fluids.

27:38.874 --> 27:40.354
Could this be sepsis?

27:40.397 --> 27:41.834
We could start a broad
spectrum antibiotic.

27:41.877 --> 27:43.183
- Let's just see
what this does first.

27:43.226 --> 27:44.706
I don't think
we're looking at sepsis.

27:44.750 --> 27:48.710
I think she's hypovolemic
from massive volume depletion.

27:48.754 --> 27:52.845
I suspect she's been sick
a lot longer than she reported.

27:52.888 --> 27:54.803
- BP's starting to come up.

- Appreciate you stepping up
to the plate on this one, Sam.

28:19.654 --> 28:21.656
- His platelets sure turned
around fast, didn't they?

28:21.700 --> 28:22.918
- Marcus is a fighter.

28:25.442 --> 28:26.966
- All right, this is my show.

28:27.009 --> 28:28.968
Once we get to the spine,
you follow my lead, understood?

28:29.011 --> 28:30.491
- Fair enough.

28:30.534 --> 28:33.233
- Mia, start my playlist.

28:33.276 --> 28:34.713
[jazz music playing]

28:34.756 --> 28:37.019
All right, after you.

28:37.063 --> 28:38.194
- Scalpel.

28:38.238 --> 28:45.071
â™ª

28:51.599 --> 28:52.818
- Where are we at?

28:52.861 --> 28:55.124
- I gave 125 of the
methylprednisolone

28:55.168 --> 28:57.083
and 50 of diphenhydramine.

28:57.126 --> 28:59.825
- All right, we're ready
to start the vancomycin.

28:59.868 --> 29:01.565
Now, we're gonna
take it slowly,

29:01.609 --> 29:03.567
gradually increase the dose
over time.

29:03.611 --> 29:05.352
Are you ready?

29:05.395 --> 29:07.093
- As I'll ever be.

- Oh, my God.

29:23.631 --> 29:25.502
Oh, my God.
My throat--I can't swallow.

29:25.546 --> 29:27.766
- Okay, we got you.
Nancy, 0.3 of Epi.

29:27.809 --> 29:31.204
- [breathing heavily]
I can't--

29:31.247 --> 29:32.379
- It takes time to work.

29:32.422 --> 29:33.946
Just stay calm.
Keep your eyes on me.

29:36.905 --> 29:39.952
Another 0.3 of Epi and another
50 of diphenhydramine.

Just a precaution.

30:13.637 --> 30:15.683
In through the nose,

30:21.384 --> 30:22.516
- That's it.

30:29.915 --> 30:33.222
- So how long have you
actually been sick?

30:33.266 --> 30:35.659
- This is day six.

30:35.703 --> 30:40.664
Ever since I stopped using.

30:41.883 --> 30:43.493
- Did you know
that these symptoms

30:43.537 --> 30:46.627
are a result of withdrawal?

30:46.670 --> 30:48.716
- I figured.

30:51.240 --> 30:54.461
Dr. Asher, if I outed you
to your colleagues--

30:54.504 --> 30:56.332
- No.

30:56.376 --> 30:57.812
No, you didn't.

30:57.856 --> 31:01.642
Everyone here knows
that I'm in recovery.

31:01.685 --> 31:05.211
And you don't have
to call me Dr. Asher.

31:06.255 --> 31:10.303
- It does feel kind of weird
calling you by your last name.

31:11.739 --> 31:14.046
I won't tell anyone in group.

31:14.089 --> 31:15.874
- Thank you.

31:15.917 --> 31:17.701
- I don't even
know if the drugs

31:17.745 --> 31:20.182
have cleared my system yet.

31:20.226 --> 31:23.011
I couldn't risk you
running a drug test on me,

31:23.055 --> 31:25.405
given everything you know
about me.

31:25.448 --> 31:30.062
I just--I don't want
anyone taking my baby away.

31:32.151 --> 31:36.155
- Well, I commend you
for quitting, Liza.

31:36.198 --> 31:38.548
Going cold turkey
is really hard.

31:38.592 --> 31:40.594
[solemn music]

31:40.637 --> 31:43.902
There are some medications
like Suboxone and methadone

31:43.945 --> 31:46.469
that can help curb
the cravings.

31:46.513 --> 31:48.515
- Those are opiates, right?

31:48.558 --> 31:50.212
- Yes.

31:50.256 --> 31:52.519
But when you're
medically supervised,

31:52.562 --> 31:55.652
you are allowed to be
on them while you're pregnant.

31:55.696 --> 31:57.393
The risk to the fetus
is minimal--

31:57.437 --> 31:58.960
- No.

31:59.004 --> 32:02.050
If there are any risks,
then no.

32:03.922 --> 32:07.969
I probably shot up,

32:08.013 --> 32:11.364
like, a half dozen times
during my first trimester.

32:13.583 --> 32:19.633
And still, by some miracle,
the baby seems to be okay.

32:22.244 --> 32:26.248
I can't do anything
to jeopardize that.

32:26.292 --> 32:27.249
I won't.

[knock at door]

32:31.645 --> 32:32.820

32:38.782 --> 32:40.654
- I was going to check
with Mrs. Sullivan

32:40.697 --> 32:42.961
to see if she would agree
to David spending

32:43.004 --> 32:45.702
a couple of nights
in the psych ward.

32:45.746 --> 32:48.009
I figure we can
talk to him more,

32:48.053 --> 32:52.709
begin to find the correct
medication and dosage.

32:52.753 --> 32:54.363
- Well, that sounds good,
Dr. Cuevas.

32:54.407 --> 32:55.974
Thank you.

32:56.017 --> 32:58.585
- Oh, and his father
is out of surgery.

32:58.628 --> 33:00.021
No complications.

33:00.065 --> 33:04.069
- Well, good stuff.
I'm glad to--glad to hear too.

33:08.769 --> 33:12.903
- I should have spoken to you
first before medicating David.

33:12.947 --> 33:15.558
- Look, you know it was
a chaotic situation,

33:15.602 --> 33:18.735
and I understand that you felt
the need to act swiftly.

33:18.779 --> 33:20.172
I do.

33:20.215 --> 33:23.349
- I probably did jump
to medication too quickly,

33:23.392 --> 33:24.654
if I'm being honest.

33:24.698 --> 33:27.657

33:27.701 --> 33:31.487

on the literature

33:31.531 --> 33:33.794
and the standard of care,

33:33.837 --> 33:38.581
but I just don't always feel

33:38.625 --> 33:41.802
like I can trust
my own instincts.

33:44.805 --> 33:49.592
- I mean, it took me
years, years.

33:49.636 --> 33:50.811
And still, I have--

33:50.854 --> 33:55.033
I have my days when--you know?

33:55.076 --> 33:58.123
But this, I can promise you,
you will get there.

33:58.166 --> 33:59.385
You will.

33:59.428 --> 34:01.169
There's not a shred
of doubt in my mind.

Trust me on that.

34:22.408 --> 34:23.974
Marcus did great.

34:27.717 --> 34:29.371
- I can't thank you
both enough.

34:29.415 --> 34:30.633
- No need.

34:30.677 --> 34:31.852
He's got a long road ahead,

34:31.895 --> 34:33.593
but with physical therapy,
I'm confident

34:33.636 --> 34:35.986
he'll be back on his feet.

34:36.030 --> 34:37.336
- [stammers]
Can--can I see him?

34:37.379 --> 34:39.381
- Of course.
I'll take you to recovery.

34:39.425 --> 34:42.123
Now, he's just waking up, so he
might be a bit groggy, okay?

34:42.167 --> 34:43.385
This way.

34:47.824 --> 34:49.870
- Dr. Abrams,
I heard the good news.

34:49.913 --> 34:51.219
I really appreciate--

34:51.263 --> 34:53.743
- Yeah, you two ever pull
a stunt like that again,

34:53.787 --> 34:54.788
I won't keep it to myself.

34:54.831 --> 34:56.224
I'll go straight to Goodwin.

34:56.268 --> 34:57.530
- Excuse me?

34:57.573 --> 34:59.358
- I don't appreciate
being conned into surgery

34:59.401 --> 35:01.403
under false pretenses.
- Wait.

35:01.447 --> 35:03.623
I'm sorry, Dr. Abrams.
What are you talking about?

35:03.666 --> 35:07.366
[tense music]

35:07.409 --> 35:09.542
- My antenna went up
when Marcus's platelets

35:09.585 --> 35:10.978
corrected so quickly.

35:11.021 --> 35:13.067
So I had the lab run
an anti-platelet antibody test

35:13.111 --> 35:14.329
while we were in surgery.

35:14.373 --> 35:16.984
You might be interested
in the results.

35:21.728 --> 35:23.251
- Marcus has ITP.
- Mm-hmm.

35:23.295 --> 35:24.731
- But this doesn't
make any sense.

35:24.774 --> 35:26.254
If Marcus has ITP,
the transfusion

35:26.298 --> 35:28.604
shouldn't have worked.
- Correct.

35:28.648 --> 35:31.477
Unless someone gave him
a little assistance.

35:31.520 --> 35:38.136
â™ª

35:41.226 --> 35:41.443
.

35:41.487 --> 35:44.011
- You gave Marcus steroids,
didn't you?

35:44.054 --> 35:45.360
And that's why
his platelet count went up.

35:45.404 --> 35:47.188
- I know steroids
can be controversial

35:47.232 --> 35:49.190
in the surgical settings--
- To put it lightly.

35:49.234 --> 35:52.324
You put him at greater risk
of post-op infection.

35:52.367 --> 35:53.803
- Vanessa, believe me
when I tell you,

35:53.847 --> 35:56.371
this was our only play.

35:56.415 --> 35:57.720
- Ouronly play?

35:57.764 --> 36:00.332
I was left in the dark.

36:00.375 --> 36:02.029
- Look, I didn't want you
catching any heat

36:02.072 --> 36:03.552
if things went south, okay?

36:03.596 --> 36:05.859
I have more cover
as an attending.

36:05.902 --> 36:07.208
I was trying to protect you.

36:07.252 --> 36:09.123
[tense music]

36:09.167 --> 36:10.820
- I do not need
your protection.

36:10.864 --> 36:12.039
I need your respect.

36:12.082 --> 36:14.041
- Vanessa,
of course I respect you.

36:14.084 --> 36:16.217
- It does not feel
that way right now.

36:16.261 --> 36:20.221
â™ª

36:25.008 --> 36:27.141
- Looking much better, Indrani.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.099
Some techs will be back soon
to move you upstairs.

36:29.143 --> 36:31.450
We're gonna keep you on IV
vancomycin for a few days

36:31.493 --> 36:34.322
and then switch you over
to the oral version.

36:34.366 --> 36:37.325
- Dr. Halstead,
I can't thank you enough.

36:37.369 --> 36:39.719
- I'm just sorry we had to
put you through all that.

36:39.762 --> 36:41.416
- Oh, it was worth it,
believe me.

36:44.463 --> 36:46.334
That's where I'm going to be
next month.

36:48.336 --> 36:50.120
- I'm adding it
to my bucket list.

36:54.734 --> 36:55.865
Would you excuse me
for a moment?

36:55.909 --> 36:57.127
- Of course.

36:59.608 --> 37:01.480
- Ms. Goodwin.

37:01.523 --> 37:03.786
- Stop by my office
before you leave tonight.

37:03.830 --> 37:05.135
I'd like a word.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.096
- Will do.

37:12.969 --> 37:15.624
- Dr. Choi,

37:15.668 --> 37:19.193
uh, this is for you.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.586
I saw you were staying on
for the night shift,

37:20.629 --> 37:23.763
so I figured you might
need a caffeine boost.

37:23.806 --> 37:25.373
Oh, and these are also for you.

37:25.417 --> 37:27.767
It's my CV,
in-progress research papers,

37:27.810 --> 37:29.203
and all my case logs to date.

37:30.987 --> 37:33.294
For our first advisor meeting
tomorrow.

37:33.338 --> 37:38.386
- Ah, well, you are
really prepared, Zach.

37:38.430 --> 37:39.518
Will you excuse me?

37:39.561 --> 37:41.476
- Yeah, of course.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.478
See you tomorrow.

37:43.522 --> 37:45.785
- See you tomorrow.

37:45.828 --> 37:48.135
Hey.
- Hey.

37:48.178 --> 37:50.746
Liza agreed to be admitted
overnight for observation.

37:50.790 --> 37:52.661
- Good.

37:52.705 --> 37:55.055
She's in withdrawal, I take it.

37:55.098 --> 37:56.970
Don't worry,
I won't say anything.

37:57.013 --> 37:59.059
- I appreciate that, Ethan.

37:59.102 --> 38:00.843
And while I suspect
that the drugs

38:00.887 --> 38:02.149
have already
cleared her system,

38:02.192 --> 38:03.890
she's terrified someone
might report her.

38:03.933 --> 38:05.587
- The last thing
she needs is to be

38:05.631 --> 38:09.069
penalized for seeking care.

38:09.112 --> 38:11.158
- Look, you were
absolutely right, by the way,

38:11.201 --> 38:13.203
to bring in Dr. Patchefsky.

38:13.247 --> 38:15.075
I never should have
given you flack for that.

38:15.118 --> 38:18.078
- Look, I know
how frustrating it is

38:18.121 --> 38:20.820
to always feel like
you're being held

38:20.863 --> 38:23.475
to some former version
of yourself.

38:23.518 --> 38:26.173
But on the flip side,
because of who you were

38:26.216 --> 38:27.914
and what you went through,

38:27.957 --> 38:29.524
you were able
to connect to Liza

38:29.568 --> 38:31.439
in a way no one else could.

38:31.483 --> 38:32.919
[pensive music]

38:32.962 --> 38:35.095
- Yeah.

38:35.138 --> 38:36.357
I guess that's true.

38:38.141 --> 38:40.361
- Maybe it's not always
such a bad thing,

38:40.405 --> 38:42.537
having your reputation
precede you.

38:42.581 --> 38:49.544
â™ª

38:50.502 --> 38:52.591
- Great work today, Sam.

[tense music]

38:55.594 --> 38:58.771
â™ª

38:58.814 --> 38:59.989
Goodnight, Dr. Taylor.

39:05.604 --> 39:07.388
- Ooh, ouch.

39:07.432 --> 39:12.132
Why, I see you've got yourself
quite the fan club.

39:12.175 --> 39:14.134
You know,
maybe I was wrong about you.

39:14.177 --> 39:16.702
You might be cut out
for island life after all.

39:16.745 --> 39:21.054
â™ª

39:21.097 --> 39:24.405
- So let me get this straight.

39:24.449 --> 39:27.277
You gave the patient
an antibiotic

39:27.321 --> 39:29.279
you knew she was allergic to--

39:29.323 --> 39:31.891
- Only after I advised her
of the potential risks

39:31.934 --> 39:33.632
and with her full consent.

39:33.675 --> 39:35.938
- Which, trust me,
wouldn't hold up in court

39:35.982 --> 39:38.550
if this thing
had gone sideways.

39:38.593 --> 39:40.595
- Well, Ms. Goodwin,
it wasn't my first choice.

39:40.639 --> 39:42.989
- I understand
the new protocols got off

39:43.032 --> 39:44.817
to a bit of a rocky start
today, but--

39:44.860 --> 39:47.080
- They're not working.

39:47.123 --> 39:48.647
I have no doubt
they were designed

39:48.690 --> 39:49.952
with the best of intentions,

39:49.996 --> 39:51.084
but as your boots
on the ground,

39:51.127 --> 39:52.302
I have to give it
to you straight.

39:52.346 --> 39:54.609
- Let me give it
to youstraight.

39:54.653 --> 39:59.048
These supply chain issues are
not gonna resolve anytime soon,

39:59.092 --> 40:02.051
and not for lack of trying
on my part.

40:02.095 --> 40:06.447
So as imperfect as these
new protocols may be,

40:06.491 --> 40:12.584
we need some sort of semblance
of order in the ED.

40:12.627 --> 40:16.501
I can't have it turning
into the Wild West!

40:18.328 --> 40:21.506
- Honestly, Ms. Goodwin,
I think we're already there.
