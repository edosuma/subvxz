00:12.792 --> 00:13.792
RAY:
Previously on Ray Donovan:

00:13.875 --> 00:14.542
Yeah.

00:14.625 --> 00:15.417
HARRIET:
We have a problem.

00:15.500 --> 00:17.458
I just got a call
from your brother.

00:17.542 --> 00:19.458
He wants to sell the gym, Ray.

00:19.542 --> 00:20.500
What are you talking about?

00:20.583 --> 00:21.917
Something about
moving to Ireland.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.458
You told me this day
would never come.

00:24.542 --> 00:25.083
You promised me.

00:25.166 --> 00:26.583
I'll take care of it.

00:26.667 --> 00:28.083
TERRY:
You're the love
of my life.

00:28.166 --> 00:29.583
Come to Ireland and marry me.

00:29.667 --> 00:31.583
Your brother murdered
that priest, didn't he?

00:31.667 --> 00:33.792
That priest raped him.

00:33.875 --> 00:35.875
Your brother scares me to death.

00:37.500 --> 00:38.417
You're so fucking beautiful.

00:38.500 --> 00:40.375
Holy shit.

00:40.458 --> 00:42.417
ASHLEY:
I need you to come to the expo.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.709
RAY:
Ashley...

00:43.792 --> 00:45.375
ASHLEY: This is not for me;
it's for a friend.

00:45.458 --> 00:46.458
He needs your help.

00:46.542 --> 00:47.625
Do you know who I am?

00:47.709 --> 00:49.083
Do you know what I do?
RAY:
Yeah.

00:49.166 --> 00:50.291
You write books.

00:50.375 --> 00:51.583
STEVE:
I'm in some trouble here.

00:51.667 --> 00:53.375
I'm leaving my wife for her.

00:53.458 --> 00:54.458
You know what
that means, right?

00:54.542 --> 00:55.417
No.

00:55.500 --> 00:57.834
It means hundreds
of millions of dollars.

00:57.917 --> 00:58.917
There she is.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.041
KEITH: That woman is the
mother of your child?

01:01.125 --> 01:02.709
She's the love of my life.

01:02.792 --> 01:04.125
I'll be damned.

01:04.208 --> 01:05.125
POTATO PIE:
Terrance told me
you got a date.

01:05.208 --> 01:06.750
Told me you looked
stressed about it, too.

01:06.834 --> 01:09.500
BUNCHY:
What is it?

01:09.583 --> 01:10.458
Soon as something gonna happen

01:10.542 --> 01:11.792
between you and your lady,
take it.

01:11.875 --> 01:12.750
Well, then what?

01:12.834 --> 01:14.000
Pop goes the weasel.

01:14.083 --> 01:15.417
BRIDGET:
His name is Marvin.

01:15.500 --> 01:16.792
Bridg, why didn't
you say anything?

01:16.875 --> 01:17.375
ABBY: You beat the
shit out of him.

01:17.458 --> 01:17.959
You think she's gonna

01:18.041 --> 01:19.709
confide in you now?

01:19.792 --> 01:20.291
I didn't lay a finger on him.

01:20.375 --> 01:21.959
I'm seeing him again.

01:22.041 --> 01:22.959
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

01:23.041 --> 01:25.000
Sweetheart, that boy
has real problems.

01:25.083 --> 01:26.542
MARVIN:
Hey, Cookie!

01:26.625 --> 01:29.333
Boy, I love the way
you sing, my nigga.

01:29.417 --> 01:31.583
We need to talk
business real soon.

01:33.834 --> 01:35.375
Aren't you gonna invite me in?

01:56.333 --> 01:58.208
(birds singing)

01:59.750 --> 02:03.458
(Skype ringtone plays)

02:16.208 --> 02:17.875
Happy birthday, little dude!

02:17.959 --> 02:19.500
Wow.

02:19.583 --> 02:20.000
I can't believe you remembered.

02:20.083 --> 02:22.208
So how are you?

02:22.291 --> 02:23.208
I'm okay.

02:23.291 --> 02:24.375
Just okay?
Yeah.

02:24.458 --> 02:27.458
I don't think anyone
remembered my birthday.

02:27.542 --> 02:29.000
Really?

02:29.083 --> 02:31.542
What, no plan, no... no party?

02:31.625 --> 02:32.041
No.

02:32.125 --> 02:33.709
That's fucked up.

02:35.458 --> 02:36.458
Hey.

02:36.542 --> 02:37.625
Be bold, brother.

02:37.709 --> 02:38.750
You want to have a party,

02:38.834 --> 02:39.333
you have a fucking party.

02:40.792 --> 02:41.709
All right.

02:41.792 --> 02:44.667
(phone buzzing)

03:01.750 --> 03:03.250
(sighs)

03:11.333 --> 03:12.417
What are you doing in London?

03:12.500 --> 03:14.208
I'm just picking up shots
on this movie

03:14.291 --> 03:16.500
I did last summer.

03:16.583 --> 03:18.417
London's kind of
freaking me out, though.

03:18.500 --> 03:19.875
I'm... I'm a little lonely.

03:21.166 --> 03:23.583
I'm sucking dick again.

03:23.667 --> 03:24.542
Your father had to help me

03:24.625 --> 03:27.041
take care of that last time,
remember?

03:27.125 --> 03:28.250
I think so.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.667
(knocking on door)

03:29.750 --> 03:32.417
(girls giggling)

03:32.500 --> 03:33.917
Okay, little dude,
I got a surprise for you.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.625
One, two, three.

03:37.709 --> 03:40.583
Happy birthday, Conor!

03:40.667 --> 03:42.291
(giggling)

03:42.375 --> 03:43.834
(laughing)

03:43.917 --> 03:46.709
TOMMY:
Happy birthday, buddy!

03:52.834 --> 03:54.125
Abs?

03:57.041 --> 03:59.166
(phone ringing)

04:10.834 --> 04:13.000
(knocking at door)

04:24.583 --> 04:26.417
(laughs)

04:31.250 --> 04:32.500
This is okay?

04:34.125 --> 04:35.208
Yeah.

04:37.709 --> 04:40.667
(sighs)

04:40.750 --> 04:41.959
I'm sorry about last night.

04:42.041 --> 04:44.083
I was overwhelmed.

04:46.542 --> 04:49.417
I thought about you all night.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.291
Me, too.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.542
I've only had sex with
one person in 20 years.

05:13.625 --> 05:15.583
So I... I only
know how to do it

05:15.667 --> 05:17.208
like my husband
likes it.

05:17.291 --> 05:18.583
Don't worry about it.

05:20.875 --> 05:22.542
How much do we
like each other?

05:22.625 --> 05:24.333
(laughing):
A lot!

05:25.458 --> 05:26.709
A lot.
Yeah.

05:26.792 --> 05:28.125
Mm-hmm.

05:41.417 --> 05:42.542
(phone ringing)

05:46.875 --> 05:48.291
I...
What?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.917
(sighs)
It's Ray.

05:52.000 --> 05:52.959
It's the second time.

05:53.041 --> 05:53.500
I gotta take it.

05:55.667 --> 05:57.625
Sorry.

05:57.709 --> 05:59.583
(sighs)

05:59.667 --> 06:00.583
What's up?

06:00.667 --> 06:01.583
Where are you?

06:01.667 --> 06:02.583
It's Conor's birthday.

06:05.875 --> 06:06.500
I know that.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.083
I'm on my way to the bakery.

06:08.166 --> 06:09.709
What are we doing for him?

06:09.792 --> 06:10.917
I don't know, Ray.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.083
Why don't you ask your son
what he wants to do?

06:13.166 --> 06:15.333
I'm getting the cake.

06:16.834 --> 06:18.917
(exhales)

06:29.041 --> 06:31.291
What is it?

06:31.375 --> 06:32.208
(sighs)

06:32.291 --> 06:34.959
I forgot my
son's birthday.

06:35.041 --> 06:37.208
Who does that?

06:37.291 --> 06:38.208
It's today?

06:38.291 --> 06:39.375
Yeah.

06:42.458 --> 06:44.834
You have all day to fix it.

06:47.125 --> 06:48.208
Come here.

06:55.667 --> 06:56.583
No, I... don't.

06:56.667 --> 06:57.583
I need to go.

06:57.667 --> 06:58.667
I just got here.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.834
I'm sorry.

07:00.917 --> 07:01.917
Will I see you later?

07:02.000 --> 07:03.166
I'm sorry.
I don't know.

07:03.250 --> 07:04.125
Abby, look...

07:04.208 --> 07:06.500
I'm confused right now.

07:10.750 --> 07:12.959
Happy birthday, kiddo.

07:13.041 --> 07:15.583
Want to go see
the Lakers tonight?

07:15.667 --> 07:17.250
I can get floor
seats from Ezra.

07:29.625 --> 07:30.875
What's wrong, Conor?

07:30.959 --> 07:33.250
You forgot my fucking birthday.

07:39.917 --> 07:41.375
You're right.

07:41.458 --> 07:43.208
Sorry.

07:43.291 --> 07:44.625
I'll make it up to you.

07:44.709 --> 07:47.125
We'll go see the Lakers
tonight, have a great time.

07:47.208 --> 07:48.583
I don't even like the Lakers.

07:48.667 --> 07:50.500
What do you want?

07:50.583 --> 07:51.125
A party.

07:51.208 --> 07:53.625
A family party.

07:53.709 --> 07:54.583
Okay.

07:54.667 --> 07:56.166
No problem.

07:56.250 --> 07:56.875
I want Terry,
Bunchy and Daryll.

07:56.959 --> 07:59.417
I'll call 'em.

08:00.333 --> 08:02.333
And Grandpa.

08:02.417 --> 08:03.625
I want the whole family here.

08:09.917 --> 08:11.333
Look, your uncles
won't be a problem,

08:11.417 --> 08:14.417
but Grandpa Mick's on parole.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.458
He's got restrictions
on him, Con.

08:16.542 --> 08:18.500
I don't want a party
if Grandpa's not coming.

08:18.583 --> 08:20.834
(phone buzzing)

08:20.917 --> 08:23.542
All right.

08:23.625 --> 08:25.125
I'll see what I can do.

08:35.333 --> 08:36.750
Goddamn it, Ashley,
what the fuck are you...

08:36.834 --> 08:38.458
STEVE:
It's Steve Knight.

08:38.542 --> 08:40.375
When she calls you,
that's me calling.

08:40.458 --> 08:43.083
RAY:
I'm not working today.

08:43.166 --> 08:44.917
I got something planned
with the family.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.083
I'm paying you $100,000 a month.

08:47.166 --> 08:48.709
That makes me family.

08:51.834 --> 08:52.417
Where are you?

08:52.500 --> 08:55.000
(TV playing indistinctly)

08:55.083 --> 08:56.959
(typewriter clacking)

09:05.875 --> 09:07.709
(exhales)

09:10.542 --> 09:12.041
Hey, Shorty.

09:12.125 --> 09:13.125
Shorty!

09:13.208 --> 09:14.291
SHORTY:
What?!

09:14.375 --> 09:16.917
I finished the treatment!

09:17.000 --> 09:17.917
It's fucking great.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.125
The hero crosses water
three times.

09:20.208 --> 09:21.458
(chuckles)

09:21.542 --> 09:22.709
KEITH:
Does he cross Melrose, too?

09:25.041 --> 09:26.625
What the fuck were you doing
at Paramount Pictures?

09:26.709 --> 09:29.625
Ain't I allowed to go
to and from work?

09:29.709 --> 09:31.458
You have a job.

09:31.542 --> 09:33.959
I got a contract.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.792
Could be worth a million bucks.

09:38.083 --> 09:40.125
Sean Walker.

09:40.208 --> 09:41.583
The work I did with him
got me in the door,

09:41.667 --> 09:44.000
and then I pitched 'em
something else.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.542
They went nuts for it.

09:45.625 --> 09:48.166
Think I was gonna peel fucking
carrots the rest of my life?

09:48.250 --> 09:50.333
Hey, maybe you and me
should team up.

09:50.417 --> 09:52.208
Start our own
company, like Ray's.

09:52.291 --> 09:54.000
I finish the script...

09:54.083 --> 09:54.792
could use a hard-ass like you.

10:06.458 --> 10:07.583
(dialing)

10:07.667 --> 10:08.792
(phone ringing)

10:11.083 --> 10:12.208
Yo.

10:12.291 --> 10:13.417
RAY:
Hey.

10:13.500 --> 10:14.667
It's Conor's birthday tonight.

10:14.750 --> 10:16.333
We're having a family dinner.

10:18.041 --> 10:20.417
How much do we pay a year
in property tax?

10:20.500 --> 10:21.333
Christ, Terry,
it's his birthday.

10:21.417 --> 10:23.667
You coming or not?

10:23.750 --> 10:24.792
Fine.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.959
But we have some things
we have to talk about first.

10:27.041 --> 10:28.041
All right.

10:28.125 --> 10:29.208
And it can't wait past tonight.

10:31.041 --> 10:32.500
Tell Bunchy about the party.

10:32.583 --> 10:34.000
You should tell him yourself.

10:34.083 --> 10:35.458
Just ask him, Terry.

10:35.542 --> 10:37.166
7:00.
Wait, wait, wait.

10:37.250 --> 10:38.375
What about Mick?
He coming?

10:38.458 --> 10:41.083
Don't worry about Mick.

10:45.208 --> 10:47.834
(exhales)

10:47.917 --> 10:48.375
BUNCHY:
I'm in the bathroom.

10:48.458 --> 10:51.291
I take the Viagra.

10:52.625 --> 10:54.500
The moment I fucking swallow it,

10:54.583 --> 10:57.083
there's a knock
on the door.

10:57.166 --> 10:58.125
The kid comes home.

10:58.208 --> 11:00.291
(laughing)

11:02.041 --> 11:04.458
So it was a
complete disaster.

11:04.542 --> 11:06.542
Uh, not really.

11:06.625 --> 11:07.709
Sounds like it.

11:08.917 --> 11:10.959
What happened then?

11:11.041 --> 11:11.542
(sighs)

11:11.625 --> 11:13.667
It got a little weird.

11:13.750 --> 11:15.583
(laughs)

11:15.667 --> 11:17.333
Then I left.

11:19.333 --> 11:21.333
So, you gonna
see her again?

11:21.417 --> 11:23.417
Yeah.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.375
I really like her.

11:25.458 --> 11:27.667
And I think
she likes me.

11:27.750 --> 11:28.500
Yeah, I know
you like her,

11:28.583 --> 11:32.125
but you just
started dating.

11:32.208 --> 11:35.250
Maybe you should
see other people.

11:35.333 --> 11:37.041
Why?

11:38.917 --> 11:41.083
I mean, she's got
a kid, Bunch.

11:41.166 --> 11:43.166
I mean, that's a lot
of responsibility.

11:47.792 --> 11:49.917
I can handle it.

11:57.959 --> 11:59.291
What's wrong?

12:03.166 --> 12:05.542
Well, it sounds like
you're having a lot of fun.

12:10.417 --> 12:12.375
I'm just really
lonely right now.

12:16.625 --> 12:18.667
Why don't you
come with me

12:18.750 --> 12:20.875
to my nephew's
birthday party tonight?

12:24.166 --> 12:25.333
Really?

12:25.417 --> 12:26.667
Sure.

12:26.750 --> 12:27.875
It'll be fun.

12:43.417 --> 12:45.667
We got a problem.

12:45.750 --> 12:47.917
Come inside,
I'll show you.

12:49.709 --> 12:51.542
Did you fuck Ashley last night?

12:58.583 --> 13:00.125
'Cause when I fucked her
this morning,

13:00.208 --> 13:01.917
I felt very close to you, Ray.

13:05.667 --> 13:08.500
What's going on with you, man?

13:08.583 --> 13:10.834
I'm getting a heavy vibe.

13:10.917 --> 13:14.166
Are you worried
about your wife finding out?

13:17.875 --> 13:20.083
When I was 12 years old,

13:20.166 --> 13:23.000
I jerked off to my mother
breastfeeding my baby sister.

13:24.583 --> 13:27.750
Unburden yourself!

13:27.834 --> 13:29.458
Try it.

13:29.542 --> 13:31.291
Say the unsayable thing.

13:31.375 --> 13:34.000
Tell me the thing
that you are afraid of.

13:35.959 --> 13:37.041
Open the door.

13:39.667 --> 13:43.792
Radical honesty, Ray.

13:48.834 --> 13:52.166
I think you're a
fucking asshole,

13:52.250 --> 13:53.250
and I'm just using
you for your money.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.959
We good now?

14:00.083 --> 14:02.917
Yeah!

14:03.000 --> 14:04.583
I love it!

14:04.667 --> 14:06.333
Was that so hard?
I mean, did anything

14:06.417 --> 14:09.041
bad happen to you?

14:14.333 --> 14:17.500
We're just scratching
the surface, baby.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.458
He's here again, Ray.

14:22.542 --> 14:23.750
Who?

14:23.834 --> 14:25.375
That creep who was stalking me.

14:25.458 --> 14:26.917
Lepecka?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.041
Come look.

14:34.709 --> 14:36.917
Don't let him
see you.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.834
STEVE:
I'm in the middle of a divorce,

14:40.917 --> 14:43.125
and this guy's taking pictures
of me with her?

14:43.208 --> 14:43.750
I'm fucked.

14:43.834 --> 14:46.667
(camera shutter clicking)

14:46.750 --> 14:48.917
He's not interested in you.

15:04.875 --> 15:08.166
What the fuck do I have
to do to you, Bob?

15:08.250 --> 15:09.792
Oh, come on!

15:09.875 --> 15:12.125
Bob!
(panting)

15:12.667 --> 15:14.625
Don't hurt me.

15:14.709 --> 15:17.250
I'm protecting her.

15:18.417 --> 15:19.125
Give me the camera, Bob.

15:21.208 --> 15:22.375
Come on.

15:37.166 --> 15:39.333
He's the bad guy,
Ray, not me.

15:39.417 --> 15:40.750
I don't go
in her house.

15:40.834 --> 15:42.250
I don't try
to hurt her.

15:42.333 --> 15:44.208
The worst thing I ever did
was jerk off in her car.

15:47.625 --> 15:50.500
She left it open.

15:51.959 --> 15:53.458
Jesus Christ.

15:53.542 --> 15:55.083
Spare me the fucking details.

15:57.709 --> 15:59.667
These are all taken, huh?

15:59.750 --> 16:01.291
Yeah.

16:01.375 --> 16:03.125
You don't have a single cake
you can sell me?

16:03.208 --> 16:05.625
No, you got to order
ahead of time.

16:05.709 --> 16:07.792
(sighs)

16:16.125 --> 16:18.417
Can I talk to you for a second?

16:19.583 --> 16:22.417
Come here.

16:25.291 --> 16:27.542
You seem like a nice kid.

16:28.667 --> 16:30.542
My son's about your age.

16:30.625 --> 16:32.333
Do me a favor.
Take this money,

16:32.417 --> 16:34.250
wipe a name off
one of the cakes,

16:34.333 --> 16:35.625
and put his name on it.

16:37.792 --> 16:39.041
Maybe someone won't pick one up.

16:39.125 --> 16:41.625
We're rated, like,
number one in Calabasas.

16:41.709 --> 16:44.208
Yeah, you never know.

16:47.792 --> 16:48.625
His name's Conor.

16:48.709 --> 16:51.792
Hurry, please.

16:55.834 --> 16:58.542
Don't you have something
you want to give me, Ray?

16:58.625 --> 17:02.166
Like what?

17:02.250 --> 17:04.583
The chip from the camera.

17:05.917 --> 17:08.000
I think I'm gonna
hang onto that.

17:08.083 --> 17:11.709
You love being in
control, don't you?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.750
You worried about me, or
are you worried about him?

17:15.834 --> 17:18.917
I'm not sure yet.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.083
(laughs)

17:22.166 --> 17:24.291
I love our relationship, Ray.

17:24.375 --> 17:26.959
It just keeps getting
better and better.

17:27.041 --> 17:29.125
Yeah.

17:38.583 --> 17:40.458
What are you doing, Bob?

17:40.542 --> 17:41.792
I had to sell my car.

17:41.875 --> 17:43.083
I can't drive anymore.

17:43.166 --> 17:45.125
You shattered the bones
in my arm.

17:45.208 --> 17:46.458
I had to have surgery.

17:46.542 --> 17:48.125
On my leg, too.

17:53.291 --> 17:55.291
Get in the fucking car.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.250
The back.

18:05.333 --> 18:07.208
Bob?

18:07.291 --> 18:09.750
Look at me, Bob.

18:09.834 --> 18:12.542
You go back there again...

18:12.625 --> 18:14.250
I know, I know.

18:14.333 --> 18:15.750
You'll kill me.

18:21.250 --> 18:23.333
(phone buzzing)

18:23.417 --> 18:25.750
(sighs)

18:30.709 --> 18:32.625
(sighs)

18:32.709 --> 18:35.000
You still live
in that same shit hole?

18:35.083 --> 18:37.750
Yup.

18:51.291 --> 18:53.250
Your brother threatened me.

18:53.333 --> 18:53.875
He scares me.

18:53.959 --> 18:56.875
He'd never hurt you.

18:56.959 --> 18:58.834
It's my nephew's birthday.

18:58.917 --> 19:01.542
I don't want to go, Terry.

19:01.625 --> 19:02.208
It's my family,

19:02.291 --> 19:05.125
and you're part of it now.

19:05.208 --> 19:07.250
I want you to be there.

19:07.333 --> 19:08.583
(door opens)

19:10.250 --> 19:12.333
Fucking Saturday.

19:12.417 --> 19:15.000
It's hard to find a buyer
in this market, Terry.

19:15.083 --> 19:17.125
I asked you how much
the gym was worth.

19:17.208 --> 19:19.166
The value is determined on how
much someone's willing...

19:19.250 --> 19:20.834
Why won't you answer me, woman?!

19:20.917 --> 19:22.834
Calm down, Terry.

19:22.917 --> 19:25.250
Just give her a chance.

19:25.333 --> 19:28.542
Let me talk to a couple
commercial brokers

19:28.625 --> 19:30.083
and see what I can do.

19:30.166 --> 19:31.917
But you still can't

19:32.000 --> 19:33.917
sell it without Ray's consent.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.834
Why not? It's his gym.

19:36.917 --> 19:38.458
He's not
the majority owner.

19:38.542 --> 19:39.667
Ray is.

19:39.750 --> 19:41.792
Don't worry
about it.

19:41.875 --> 19:44.041
I'm seeing him tonight.

19:48.583 --> 19:49.375
ABBY:
Bridg?

19:59.709 --> 20:01.792
Uh, Mom?

20:06.750 --> 20:09.417
Oh, fuck.

20:09.834 --> 20:12.792
Just help me.

20:12.875 --> 20:14.959
(sighs)

20:19.542 --> 20:22.375
Mama, you know I can't stay
for the party tonight.

20:22.458 --> 20:25.375
What do you mean?
It's your brother's birthday.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.667
Marvin and I are
recording tonight.

20:27.750 --> 20:30.375
They had to book the studio.
It costs a lot of money.

20:31.792 --> 20:33.709
Besides, you and Daddy
just invented this party

20:33.792 --> 20:35.333
out of nowhere.
There was no plan.

20:35.417 --> 20:37.583
I don't care.
You're staying, young lady.

20:39.208 --> 20:42.291
You came home late last night.

20:42.375 --> 20:43.875
Where were you?

20:43.959 --> 20:44.834
I was out with a friend.

20:44.917 --> 20:47.667
You don't have a friend.

20:50.458 --> 20:54.291
If you want
to invite Marvin here, you can.

20:54.375 --> 20:56.500
Are you kidding?

20:56.583 --> 20:58.583
No. Daddy would kill him.

20:58.667 --> 21:01.208
It's my house, too.

21:05.792 --> 21:07.667
(phone ringing)

21:09.208 --> 21:11.291
Yeah?

21:11.375 --> 21:13.542
Your son invited me
to his birthday party tonight.

21:13.625 --> 21:15.125
You got a problem with that?

21:15.208 --> 21:17.375
'Cause I don't want to come
if I'm not welcome.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.458
Look, if it's a problem,

21:20.542 --> 21:23.417
I'll just call him back
and tell him I don't feel well.

21:25.583 --> 21:27.417
No, it's not a problem.

21:27.500 --> 21:31.250
So you'll handle it with
that parole officer you hired?

21:31.333 --> 21:34.375
Yeah, sure. Why not?

21:34.458 --> 21:36.542
Oh, uh, one more thing.

21:36.625 --> 21:38.375
I got a date tonight.

21:38.458 --> 21:39.917
You're not bringing a hooker
to Conor's birthday, Mick.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.750
Nah, it's a nice lady.

21:41.834 --> 21:44.709
You'll see.

21:49.375 --> 21:51.375
Cherry?

21:51.458 --> 21:53.208
Yeah.

21:53.291 --> 21:54.458
Come here a minute.

21:56.667 --> 21:59.709
Shorty don't feel so good,
and I'm going out.

21:59.792 --> 22:02.375
Why don't you keep him company?

22:02.458 --> 22:03.166
He's not contagious.

22:03.250 --> 22:05.458
Sure thing, Mick.
No problem.

22:05.542 --> 22:08.542

We're going
to the recording studio.

22:37.417 --> 22:40.000
No, you're not.
Get back in the house.

22:41.000 --> 22:41.542
No.

Let's start over again.

22:59.583 --> 23:00.458

23:13.000 --> 23:15.375
we were just
picking up a little friend.

23:24.375 --> 23:26.125
Yep.
Yeah.

23:26.208 --> 23:28.875

23:28.959 --> 23:30.041

You took the car,

24:51.250 --> 24:53.375
I'm not your chauffeur.

All right. Take it easy.

26:03.583 --> 26:04.750

26:06.959 --> 26:09.875
You got some balls
to ask me that.

26:09.959 --> 26:11.875
What time did you get in
last night?

26:11.959 --> 26:13.917

downstairs?

Oh, that's so nice.

39:06.917 --> 39:09.750
Come in.

39:14.041 --> 39:17.250
I'm texting with Marvin.

39:17.333 --> 39:19.125
Just so you know.

39:20.917 --> 39:23.000
Yeah.

39:25.250 --> 39:26.667
What, are you drunk?

39:28.417 --> 39:29.792
A little.

39:39.542 --> 39:42.500
(laughs)

39:42.583 --> 39:45.000
Ah, fuck.

39:45.083 --> 39:46.875
I'm gonna keep
seeing him.

39:46.959 --> 39:48.667
You can't stop me.

39:51.375 --> 39:52.583
He attacked you.

39:52.667 --> 39:56.333
I had every right
to take him out of the house.

40:01.166 --> 40:03.291
He's got some
dangerous friends, Bridg.

40:03.375 --> 40:06.208
It's not your world.

40:06.291 --> 40:09.583
You can't see him anymore.
That's it. I'm sorry.

40:12.041 --> 40:15.375
Didn't you ever love somebody
that wasn't right for you?

40:18.375 --> 40:20.166
Yeah, I did.

40:20.250 --> 40:21.583
What happened?

40:21.667 --> 40:22.875
She's dead.

40:25.041 --> 40:27.667
Is that the woman
that Grandpa killed?

40:29.000 --> 40:31.208
It's a long story.

40:32.834 --> 40:33.166
Why'd you love her?

40:33.250 --> 40:34.875
I don't know.

40:34.959 --> 40:35.834
She was sexy.

40:35.917 --> 40:37.959
Complicated.

40:38.041 --> 40:39.500
(soft laugh)

40:39.583 --> 40:43.208
I don't know.
I thought she was interesting.

40:45.083 --> 40:47.875
But you know what?

40:47.959 --> 40:49.500
After she was killed,
the worst thing

40:49.583 --> 40:51.041
turned out to be the best thing.

40:52.000 --> 40:52.583
Why?

40:54.917 --> 40:56.709
Because your mother
came back into my life

40:56.792 --> 40:58.166
and we had you guys.

40:59.250 --> 40:59.959
So what are you saying?

41:00.041 --> 41:02.625
I'll get over him?

41:04.625 --> 41:04.875
Yeah.

41:04.959 --> 41:07.917
You will.

41:08.875 --> 41:11.333
And you think that Mom
is the best thing

41:11.417 --> 41:12.667
that ever happened to you?

41:15.959 --> 41:18.750
Yeah.

41:18.834 --> 41:21.750
She is.

41:21.834 --> 41:25.583
Mom came home at
2:00 a.m. last night.
