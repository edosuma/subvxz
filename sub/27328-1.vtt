About face.

00:31.118 --> 00:32.118
Come here.

00:44.047 --> 00:46.680
You wanna know what I wished for?

00:50.609 --> 00:53.853
I wished for you to
come back to me safely.

01:04.459 --> 01:05.459
Heads or tails?

01:07.990 --> 01:11.329
- What's heads mean?

01:11.330 --> 01:14.663
- It means you're gonna
come back to me, safely.

01:15.856 --> 01:16.856
Okay?

01:17.654 --> 01:18.654
- Then heads.

01:22.900 --> 01:25.104
- Tails means you come
back safely.

01:25.105 --> 01:27.605
- What is it?
- No, don't look!

02:09.863 --> 02:11.952

02:11.953 --> 02:13.036
- What is it?

02:14.690 --> 02:16.133
- I'm scared, Matthew.

02:18.250 --> 02:19.953
I just want you to come back.

02:22.787 --> 02:24.870
- Then let's get married.

02:25.806 --> 02:28.441
Marry me.

02:28.442 --> 02:29.442
- What?

02:31.995 --> 02:32.995
- Marry me.

02:34.136 --> 02:35.803
- Matthew, are you serious?

02:36.705 --> 02:41.043
- I don't have a ring,
but I'll get you one.

02:41.044 --> 02:43.176
- I don't know what to say.

02:43.177 --> 02:44.177
- Say yes.

02:47.972 --> 02:49.408
- Okay.

02:49.409 --> 02:50.317
- Okay?

02:50.318 --> 02:53.229
- Yes, I'll marry you!
- Okay!

02:53.230 --> 02:54.273
- Oh my gosh!

02:57.760 --> 02:58.760
- Let's do it now.

02:59.575 --> 03:01.549
- Right here?
- Right here.

03:01.550 --> 03:02.559
Right now.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.329
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

03:04.330 --> 03:05.613
- No, really?

03:07.040 --> 03:10.249
- Dearly beloved, we're
gathered here today

03:10.250 --> 03:13.393
for the union of Matthew and Scarlett.

03:14.840 --> 03:16.929
Matthew, do you take Scarlett

03:16.930 --> 03:18.563
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

03:23.654 --> 03:24.654
I do.

03:26.861 --> 03:30.200
And do you, Scarlett, take Matthew

03:30.201 --> 03:33.118
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

03:34.980 --> 03:36.029
- I do.

03:41.315 --> 03:45.482
- Scarlett, I will protect
you and provide for you

03:46.930 --> 03:51.779
from this day forth through
sickness and in health,

03:51.780 --> 03:54.749
through the good times and the bad times,

03:54.750 --> 03:56.327
for richer or poorer,

03:58.870 --> 04:01.790
from today until death do us part.

04:06.486 --> 04:11.486
- Matthew, I promise to care for you

04:12.610 --> 04:16.512
and to love you through
sickness and in health,

04:17.410 --> 04:18.660
through richer or poorer,

04:19.550 --> 04:22.253
for the rest of my life
until the day I die.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.721
- Well, kiss the bride already!

04:37.085 --> 04:38.085
- Oh!

04:41.980 --> 04:42.980
Give me your hand.

04:46.124 --> 04:47.124
Boop!

04:48.763 --> 04:49.812
There you go.

04:49.813 --> 04:53.143
Now you are officially my husband.

04:54.320 --> 04:59.320
- I'll never take it off.

05:03.813 --> 05:05.063
I have something for you.

05:06.344 --> 05:07.594
- You do?
- Turn around.

05:10.102 --> 05:11.102
- Okay.

05:13.460 --> 05:15.923
- Don't look.
- I won't, I won't.

05:16.940 --> 05:19.703
You have one minute, Matthew.

05:32.162 --> 05:33.329
Are you ready?

05:34.374 --> 05:36.374
- Turn around.

05:41.080 --> 05:42.080
- What's this?

05:43.180 --> 05:45.713
- My grandmother loved red ribbon,

05:47.400 --> 05:50.599
and whenever I see it I think of her,

05:50.600 --> 05:54.159
so I made you this so
that when you wear it

05:54.160 --> 05:55.643
you can think of me.

06:06.792 --> 06:07.792
- I love it.

06:12.386 --> 06:14.053
- Don't take it off.

06:14.900 --> 06:15.900
- Never.

06:22.334 --> 06:23.600
Woo!

06:23.601 --> 06:25.386
- Woo!
- We're married!

06:25.387 --> 06:27.404
- Woo woo woo woo woo!

08:02.128 --> 08:02.961
- Scarlett?

08:02.962 --> 08:03.969
It's Mother.

08:03.970 --> 08:06.169
Why is this door closed?

08:06.170 --> 08:07.003
- Just a second!

08:07.004 --> 08:08.869
- What are you doing
up in your room all day?

08:08.870 --> 08:10.079
Open this door.

08:11.920 --> 08:12.920
- I just...

08:14.690 --> 08:15.898
It's open.

08:17.800 --> 08:21.319
- I don't know why
doors are closed in my house.

08:21.320 --> 08:22.320
- Hey.

08:25.243 --> 08:26.243
- Ooh.

08:28.470 --> 08:31.199
My shoulder, it hurts so much.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.190
You know, that rivet gun,

08:32.191 --> 08:34.149
it just vibrates all day.

08:34.150 --> 08:36.399
It's more than I bargained for.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.429
- I could get you some water.

08:38.429 --> 08:40.832
Or some milk with, would
you like some milk?

08:42.320 --> 08:44.058
- Milk would be lovely.

08:44.059 --> 08:44.893
- I'll be right back.

08:44.894 --> 08:47.263
- What have you been doing
with yourself all day?

08:49.080 --> 08:50.972
- Oh, you know, just,

08:53.590 --> 08:54.462
the usual.

08:54.463 --> 08:56.709
- You know, the men are down at the front,

08:56.710 --> 08:59.249
the women have to go down
to the factories and work.

08:59.250 --> 09:00.449
The more of us that pitch in,

09:00.450 --> 09:03.063
the sooner the soldiers will be back.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.080
- I know, Mom.

09:10.220 --> 09:11.543
- There's nothing in this.

09:13.030 --> 09:14.130
What are you thinking?

09:15.160 --> 09:16.160
- I'm sorry.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.209
I'm, I'm not thinking clearly, okay?

09:19.210 --> 09:20.460
I really don't feel well.

09:23.330 --> 09:27.703
I just have these headaches, and nausea.

09:28.578 --> 09:30.128
- Well, maybe you have the flu.

09:31.930 --> 09:33.669
- It's going around, right?

09:33.670 --> 09:34.670
- So I hear.

09:35.432 --> 09:37.139
But we all need to do our part.

09:37.140 --> 09:39.090
If you haven't heard, there's a war on.

09:41.530 --> 09:42.530
- Mom,

09:43.750 --> 09:44.610
that reminds me.

09:44.611 --> 09:45.939
I have a question.

09:45.940 --> 09:46.773
- I'm your mother.

09:46.774 --> 09:47.853
You can ask me anything.

09:49.200 --> 09:53.033
- Okay, well, it's kinda personal, okay?

09:54.830 --> 09:56.829
It's about my period.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.259
- Menstruation, Scarlett.

09:58.260 --> 09:59.180
Women menstruate.

09:59.181 --> 10:00.800
- Right, menstruation.

10:05.601 --> 10:09.101
Okay, I don't really know how to ask this.

10:12.350 --> 10:16.523
When you're on your menstrual cycle,

10:17.860 --> 10:20.060
are you supposed to
start every month, like,

10:21.720 --> 10:22.929
on the dot?

10:22.930 --> 10:24.739
- I'm sure there's a book at the library.

10:24.740 --> 10:25.573
You can look up--

10:25.574 --> 10:27.329
- Mom, I really would rather just ask you

10:27.330 --> 10:28.739
than go all the way down to the library.

10:28.740 --> 10:31.729
- Yes, a woman menstruates every 28 days.

10:31.730 --> 10:32.943
Next subject.

10:37.950 --> 10:38.950
- Okay.

10:40.040 --> 10:44.783
So what if they're late a couple weeks?

10:46.610 --> 10:48.213
- That's not a problem.

10:49.220 --> 10:50.289
- A month?

10:50.290 --> 10:52.109
- Well, I would go to the doctor.

10:52.110 --> 10:54.060
Why are you, who are you talking about?

10:55.790 --> 10:56.790
- A friend.

10:58.510 --> 10:59.510
- What friend?

11:00.550 --> 11:03.449
- Just someone that I've been
friends with for a while.

11:03.450 --> 11:04.450
That's all.

11:06.100 --> 11:10.383
- I would not associate with
this loose girl any longer.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.133
It's like Nicole across the street.

11:17.250 --> 11:20.359
Her boyfriend and her decided
to have premarital sex

11:20.360 --> 11:24.099
and he went off to the front
line, got himself killed,

11:24.100 --> 11:26.949
and now she's at home
with a baby, not married.

11:26.950 --> 11:28.239
How is she gonna afford that?

11:28.240 --> 11:29.853
You're lucky you're not her.

11:32.200 --> 11:33.903
Why are you so upset?

11:36.190 --> 11:37.433
How old is this girl?

11:41.170 --> 11:42.663
- Her birthday's next week.

11:45.780 --> 11:48.282
- Is this some roundabout way to tell me

11:48.283 --> 11:49.523
that you're pregnant?

11:55.530 --> 11:56.530
- Yeah.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.282
- I did not raise you like that.

12:00.283 --> 12:02.169
- I didn't plan this!

12:02.170 --> 12:03.170
- Apparently not.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.429
- Look, I know you're disappointed,

12:06.430 --> 12:09.389
but I am so scared.

12:09.390 --> 12:10.453
- Who is this boy?

12:11.430 --> 12:12.430
What's his name?

12:14.290 --> 12:15.329
- His name's Matthew.

12:15.330 --> 12:16.163
- Matthew.

12:16.164 --> 12:18.333
And where is this Matthew?

12:22.700 --> 12:24.200
- He's at the front line, Mom.

12:33.700 --> 12:36.159
- Well, we're gonna take care of this,

12:36.160 --> 12:37.959
and what we're gonna do

12:37.960 --> 12:40.519
is we're going to send you off to a home

12:40.520 --> 12:42.002
for unwed mothers--
- What?

12:42.003 --> 12:43.089
Mom, no!

12:43.090 --> 12:45.489
I'm not gonna give my
child up for adoption.

12:45.490 --> 12:46.689
- You'll have the baby there.

12:46.690 --> 12:50.239
Some nice family will give it a good home

12:50.240 --> 12:51.559
who can afford a baby.

12:51.560 --> 12:53.603
- This is my child we're talking about.

12:55.030 --> 12:56.563
Your grandchild!

12:59.580 --> 13:01.189
What, are you honestly telling me

13:01.190 --> 13:05.209
that you'd be okay with me having a child

13:05.210 --> 13:06.973
and giving them up for adoption?

13:07.920 --> 13:09.863
And you never knowing your grandchild?

13:11.570 --> 13:12.570
Never,

13:14.770 --> 13:16.620
never knowing how they grew up to be?

13:21.650 --> 13:23.300
Would you have done that with me?

13:27.730 --> 13:30.059
- We'll go to the pastor and we'll see

13:30.060 --> 13:31.793
if he has an answer for us.

13:33.280 --> 13:37.073
It's different now, because
the boys are at war.

13:39.620 --> 13:41.470
We'll figure out what to do together.

13:44.070 --> 13:45.093
Get dressed, honey.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.033
We're goin' to church.

14:04.870 --> 14:06.823
Go practice your guitar, Owen.

14:08.840 --> 14:10.096
30 minutes.

14:21.500 --> 14:22.509
Pick the guitar up.

14:22.510 --> 14:24.373
Let's get moving.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.059
- 20 minutes?

14:27.060 --> 14:27.910
- You know the drill.

14:27.911 --> 14:29.499
We do this every day.

14:29.500 --> 14:30.643
- 21 minutes?

14:31.705 --> 14:33.556
- Well, if you
wanna get good at something

14:33.557 --> 14:35.809
you need to practice.

14:35.810 --> 14:37.133
Practice makes perfect.

14:41.150 --> 14:42.519
Thank you.

14:42.520 --> 14:44.283
- But Grandma, I'm tired.

14:46.641 --> 14:48.593
- You practice your guitar, please.

14:50.110 --> 14:51.639
Grandma has all this sewing she has to do

14:51.640 --> 14:52.640
for Aunt Milly.

14:57.461 --> 15:00.409
Play me that song that they taught you.

15:00.410 --> 15:01.653
You remember.

15:03.102 --> 15:06.519
(guitar strings twanging

15:27.130 --> 15:28.689
What's that?

15:28.690 --> 15:30.454
- I can't play the guitar.

15:30.455 --> 15:31.370
The string's broken.

15:31.371 --> 15:34.999
- Honey, I told you, you need
to take care of your things.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.293
- I have some money.

15:37.180 --> 15:40.093
- It's a really valuable
instrument in this family.

15:41.070 --> 15:43.870
- Oh, Grandma, can you read
this letter from my teacher?

15:45.430 --> 15:46.880
- A letter from your teacher?

15:48.610 --> 15:49.910
What did you do this time?

15:51.290 --> 15:53.023
This is all Grandma needs today.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.600
Well, I hope it's good news.

15:57.950 --> 16:02.950
Dear Owen and family, you and
all your family and friends

16:04.260 --> 16:06.489
are cordially invited to join the school

16:06.490 --> 16:10.583
for cookies and photographs,

16:11.800 --> 16:13.389
tomorrow.

16:13.390 --> 16:15.623
Well, isn't that nice.

16:17.460 --> 16:21.833
We can go have a family
photo together, all of us.

16:24.395 --> 16:25.395
- All?

16:27.825 --> 16:31.579
- All is you and me.

16:31.580 --> 16:32.923
That's all.

16:34.610 --> 16:39.187
But what I think they
meant is all your family,

16:42.310 --> 16:46.489
your mom and your dad,

16:46.490 --> 16:49.723
and your grandma, you.

16:57.670 --> 16:59.233
- Where are your parents?

17:01.613 --> 17:04.280
- Well,

17:07.609 --> 17:08.609
they're in heaven.

17:11.916 --> 17:13.213
- Is heaven fun?

17:17.980 --> 17:19.423
- It's a very fun place.

17:21.010 --> 17:24.032
- Then why don't you go to heaven?

17:24.034 --> 17:26.989
- Well, then I would miss out

17:26.990 --> 17:28.903
on raising you every day, wouldn't I?

17:33.430 --> 17:35.427
- Are my parents in heaven?

17:38.127 --> 17:39.127
- No, Owen.

17:45.703 --> 17:49.066
I don't know where they are, honey.

17:49.067 --> 17:50.917
- Then why don't they come to see me?

17:55.270 --> 17:56.770
- I don't know where they are,

17:58.230 --> 18:01.293
but I'm sure they wish they were here.

18:04.200 --> 18:07.516
And someday, they might come here

18:07.517 --> 18:11.483
and just surprise you,
and surprise me too.

18:13.730 --> 18:15.093
They will come in the door,

18:19.140 --> 18:20.290
and we'll see your mom.

18:23.450 --> 18:24.533
And your dad.

18:26.930 --> 18:28.973
And they're gonna give you a big hug.

18:35.180 --> 18:37.259
- Why don't they just come now?

18:37.260 --> 18:38.689
I don't want a surprise.

18:38.690 --> 18:41.253
I just want them to be here.

18:44.350 --> 18:46.209
- I would do anything I could

18:46.210 --> 18:48.323
to get them here for you, Owen.

18:49.599 --> 18:50.599
Anything.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.184
What are you doing?

19:06.116 --> 19:07.116
- Mom?

19:08.906 --> 19:09.906
Dad?

19:14.108 --> 19:15.275
Are you there?

19:19.056 --> 19:21.025
I really miss you.

19:21.026 --> 19:22.217
Are you there?

19:22.218 --> 19:25.976
If you can hear me, please say something.

19:25.977 --> 19:27.394
- Get down.

19:28.980 --> 19:29.980
- Dad?

19:31.331 --> 19:32.331
Dad!

19:38.565 --> 19:41.560
Why won't you pick up the phone?

19:41.561 --> 19:42.561
- Oh, Owen.

19:50.458 --> 19:51.708
Owen, get down.

19:54.963 --> 19:56.729
Owen, your parents aren't in a place

19:56.730 --> 20:00.120
that you can reach them.

20:09.370 --> 20:12.993
Now, enough of this.

20:14.490 --> 20:16.159
We need to stick to the plan.

20:16.160 --> 20:19.403
- Grandma, I wanna see my parents.

20:20.790 --> 20:22.973
- Owen, please.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.259
You need to go take a bath.

20:26.260 --> 20:28.469
- Please, I just wanna
stay up a little later.

20:28.470 --> 20:30.473
- You have to get up early for school.

20:33.410 --> 20:35.429
Please, Owen!

20:35.430 --> 20:38.179
You are giving me a
really hard time tonight,

20:38.180 --> 20:39.239
and you know what,

20:39.240 --> 20:41.629
I'm gonna go give you
a hard time tomorrow.

20:41.630 --> 20:44.369
I'm gonna go to that school
with my biggest funny red hat

20:44.370 --> 20:46.199
and my biggest funny red shoes

20:46.200 --> 20:47.459
and I'm gonna walk in there

20:47.460 --> 20:49.189
and I'm gonna have a big sign

20:49.190 --> 20:51.393
and I'm gonna yell that
I'm Owen's grandma.

20:53.175 --> 20:54.503
- Okay, I'll take a bath.

21:02.350 --> 21:03.909
- Goodnight, Owen.

21:03.910 --> 21:05.723
I love you very much.

21:13.760 --> 21:15.523
My sweet prince.

21:18.340 --> 21:19.340
When you wake up,

21:22.470 --> 21:24.293
Grandma's gonna have a surprise.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.097
I'm gonna go find your mom and dad.

21:39.620 --> 21:41.420
And I'm gonna bring 'em back to you.

21:44.887 --> 21:48.320
And I'm not gonna let
you down one day more.

21:52.099 --> 21:54.016
I love you, sweet Owen.

22:57.875 --> 23:00.708
- Grandma's been gone for one day,

23:02.238 --> 23:05.615
two days, three days, four days,

23:05.616 --> 23:08.939
five days, six days, seven days,

23:08.940 --> 23:13.023
eight days, nine days, 10
days, 11 days, 12 days,

23:15.536 --> 23:16.536
13.

23:45.898 --> 23:47.167
- Owen!

23:47.168 --> 23:48.251
It's me, Zoe.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.428
Coming in.

23:58.022 --> 23:59.022
Owen?

24:00.550 --> 24:01.779
Huh.

24:01.780 --> 24:04.197
I wonder where Owen could be.

24:06.748 --> 24:07.748
Hmm.

24:08.700 --> 24:10.179
Well, if he's not here,

24:10.180 --> 24:12.654
I guess I'll just leave.

24:12.655 --> 24:13.738
- Zoe!

24:17.840 --> 24:18.840
Boo!

24:20.103 --> 24:21.572
- What are you doing?

24:21.573 --> 24:24.035
- I was hiding 'cause
no one comes to see me.

24:24.036 --> 24:27.823
- No one comes to see you,
what are you talkin' about?

24:27.824 --> 24:28.657
Be careful.

24:28.658 --> 24:29.757
Come here.

24:32.086 --> 24:33.859
- Woo!

24:33.860 --> 24:36.269
- Oh my goodness!
- Again, again, again!

24:36.270 --> 24:37.773
- Okay, this way.
- One more.

24:37.774 --> 24:39.559
- Here we go.

24:39.560 --> 24:41.114
- Okay, one more, one more, one more.

24:41.115 --> 24:41.948
- Okay, woo!

24:41.949 --> 24:43.539
One more.

24:43.540 --> 24:44.540
Ohh, okay.

24:47.227 --> 24:50.296
Ooh!

24:50.297 --> 24:52.009
You are heavy!

24:52.010 --> 24:53.063
Wow, you've grown.

24:54.357 --> 24:55.357
Woo!

25:00.899 --> 25:02.066
Oh, come here.

25:03.060 --> 25:04.050
I missed you.

25:04.051 --> 25:06.351
- I missed you too.

25:06.352 --> 25:07.893
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

25:08.920 --> 25:10.209
- I'm going out with my friends tonight

25:10.210 --> 25:13.523
for a little special thing,
but I did get you a present.

25:17.110 --> 25:18.443
Merry Christmas!

25:21.688 --> 25:22.688
- Thanks!

25:31.460 --> 25:32.460
Wait a minute.

25:37.660 --> 25:39.479
This is the exact same wrapping paper

25:39.480 --> 25:41.633
I got last year from Santa.

25:43.970 --> 25:45.633
Are you Santa?

25:46.750 --> 25:47.750
- No.

25:48.430 --> 25:50.703
Maybe he has the same wrapping paper.

25:52.620 --> 25:53.773
- Let me check.

25:53.774 --> 25:54.774
- Okay.

25:59.580 --> 26:00.580
- It's gone.

26:01.800 --> 26:04.732
- Well, I'm not Santa Claus, so.

26:04.733 --> 26:07.399
I mean, do I look like an old man to you?

26:07.400 --> 26:08.953
- No.
- Mm-hm.

26:13.060 --> 26:15.610
- Is it okay if I go out
with your friends tonight?

26:18.980 --> 26:19.813
- No.

26:19.814 --> 26:23.429
I'm kinda having a special
night with my friends.

26:23.430 --> 26:27.073
- Your friends meaning, like, a boyfriend?

26:29.354 --> 26:30.829
- Kinda, yeah.

26:30.830 --> 26:32.253
- And have you kissed him?

26:35.060 --> 26:36.399
- Yes.

26:36.400 --> 26:41.400
- So, if you kissed him,
are you gonna marry him?

26:43.740 --> 26:46.430
- Probably, yeah.

26:46.431 --> 26:47.723
- Are you gonna have kids?

26:48.830 --> 26:50.669
- Yeah, I think so.

26:50.670 --> 26:53.109
- You gonna abandon 'em
like my mom and dad did?

26:53.110 --> 26:55.133
- Oh my God, no, sweetie.

26:56.270 --> 26:57.270
No.

27:02.544 --> 27:05.349
- Well, since I can't go,

27:05.350 --> 27:07.786
at least I'll give you a few pointers.

27:07.787 --> 27:08.787
- Okay.

27:10.540 --> 27:11.540
Go ahead.

27:14.420 --> 27:15.253
- Okay.

27:15.254 --> 27:16.414
Put your hair back.

27:16.415 --> 27:18.142
Put your hair back.
- Okay.

27:18.143 --> 27:21.182
- And now just loosen up
your dress a little bit.

27:21.183 --> 27:23.282
- All right.

27:23.283 --> 27:25.332
- There you go, perfect.

27:25.333 --> 27:27.113
- Do I look presentable now?

27:27.973 --> 27:28.880
- Yes.

27:28.880 --> 27:29.880
- Okay.

27:30.950 --> 27:33.869
Well, I wanted to talk to you

27:33.870 --> 27:37.149
about what you said
earlier about your parents.

27:37.150 --> 27:39.479
I know that you've been having

27:39.480 --> 27:42.649
a little bit of trouble
with your parents being gone

27:42.650 --> 27:44.143
and everything, right?

27:45.070 --> 27:48.131
Even though they don't
come around very often,

27:48.132 --> 27:50.459
they're going to come back eventually.

27:50.460 --> 27:51.293
They miss you.

27:51.294 --> 27:53.289
They just have things to do, okay?

27:53.290 --> 27:54.290
- Okay.

27:57.992 --> 28:01.726
Are you sure
I can't come with you?

28:01.727 --> 28:03.060
'Cause you know,

28:04.470 --> 28:05.986
I am a man.

28:05.987 --> 28:09.349
- You know, maybe next year

28:09.350 --> 28:11.839
you can come with me and my friends

28:11.840 --> 28:14.163
'cause I'm sure you would fit right in.

28:16.057 --> 28:17.352
- Okay.

28:17.353 --> 28:20.052
- Do you want me to stay a little longer?

28:20.053 --> 28:22.275
- Nah, nah, you can go.

28:22.276 --> 28:23.529
- Oh, I can go?
- Yeah.

28:23.530 --> 28:24.363
- You're a big man,

28:24.364 --> 28:26.149
you can hang out here by yourself?

28:26.150 --> 28:27.263
- Yeah.
- Okay.

28:32.526 --> 28:33.526
Well.

28:40.730 --> 28:42.689
Do I look okay?
- You look fine.

28:44.060 --> 28:47.502
- Ooh, I love you.
- I love you too, Zoe.

28:47.503 --> 28:50.243
- There's a little somethin' on your face.

28:52.010 --> 28:53.158
Got it.

28:53.159 --> 28:55.189
Okay, have a nice night.

28:55.190 --> 28:56.190
- You too.

30:50.638 --> 30:53.358
- The country, it
doesn't mean anything.

31:30.394 --> 31:32.313
- Owen!

31:33.783 --> 31:34.783
Ah!
- Oh!

31:38.540 --> 31:39.540
Who are you?

31:40.696 --> 31:42.236
- Who are you?

31:42.237 --> 31:44.890
You're not, you're not Owen.

31:45.735 --> 31:47.902
- You're looking for Owen.

31:50.634 --> 31:51.634
All right.

31:53.318 --> 31:54.929
Makes sense.

31:54.930 --> 31:55.930
Oh, wow.

31:56.918 --> 31:59.474
Okay.

31:59.475 --> 32:01.058
- Wait, wait, wait.

32:01.986 --> 32:03.829
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

32:03.830 --> 32:04.670
It's okay, okay.

32:04.671 --> 32:06.399
Hi, my name is Zoe.

32:06.400 --> 32:08.999
I am Owen's Cousin.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

32:11.085 --> 32:14.069
Yeah, do I look 18 to you?

32:14.070 --> 32:17.386
- Maybe Owen likes older women.

32:17.387 --> 32:19.943
- Have more
confidence, sweetie.

32:21.050 --> 32:24.759
I didn't know Owen had such
a beautiful girlfriend.

32:24.760 --> 32:27.339
Here, how about I get you something

32:27.340 --> 32:29.759
other than wine to drink, maybe milk?

32:29.760 --> 32:32.399
- I don't normally drink, I promise.

32:32.400 --> 32:35.069
- I believe you.

32:35.070 --> 32:36.767
Let me go get you some milk.

32:36.768 --> 32:37.601
- No!

32:37.601 --> 32:38.434
Wait.

32:38.435 --> 32:40.849
Milk, milk makes you so fat.

32:40.850 --> 32:42.699
- Oh, but it'll help your tummy.

32:42.700 --> 32:44.540
I'm going to go get it for you.

32:44.541 --> 32:45.624
- Okay, okay.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.149
- Okay.

32:52.150 --> 32:53.519
Hi.
- I'm okay.

32:53.520 --> 32:55.333
- Okay, let me, here we go.

32:56.890 --> 32:58.557
There, a little bit.

32:59.510 --> 33:00.510
Okay.

33:08.460 --> 33:10.063
- Where is Owen?

33:11.500 --> 33:12.559
- He's out.

33:12.560 --> 33:14.159
He'll be back shortly.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.633
He's just getting a box.

33:17.810 --> 33:19.679
- But when will he be back?

33:19.680 --> 33:21.563
- Oh, well,

33:22.520 --> 33:24.393
when he gets a box.

33:25.410 --> 33:27.989
He's been out for around two hours.

33:27.990 --> 33:30.023
He should be back any minute.

33:31.040 --> 33:33.577
You can stay here until he gets back.

33:35.053 --> 33:36.443
- You are so nice.

33:39.610 --> 33:40.610
- So.

33:42.190 --> 33:45.039
How long have you known Owen?

33:45.040 --> 33:46.440
Or, where did you meet Owen?

33:48.934 --> 33:52.990
- I met him on a street
playin' the guitar.

33:54.896 --> 33:55.979
- Hm, lovely.

33:57.430 --> 33:59.312
Yeah, wow.

33:59.313 --> 34:04.049
Well, how long have you two been together?

34:04.050 --> 34:05.133
Ooh, careful.

34:06.783 --> 34:08.243
- Only one year.

34:10.489 --> 34:13.668
But, I, I can't find him.

34:13.670 --> 34:17.743
- Yeah, yeah, he's been
kind of on his own recently.

34:18.710 --> 34:19.710
Poor guy.

34:23.580 --> 34:25.549
- Why does he need boxes?

34:25.550 --> 34:28.179
- He had this lovely idea

34:28.179 --> 34:32.839
to take his guitar and
move to some random village

34:32.840 --> 34:34.688
and live with the locals to get away

34:34.690 --> 34:38.983
from modern society and the
environment, major cities.

34:40.221 --> 34:41.228
- Ah!

34:41.230 --> 34:43.458
I can go with him!

34:43.460 --> 34:44.481
- Oh, oh!

34:44.482 --> 34:46.741
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

34:46.742 --> 34:47.967
No, no, no.

34:47.969 --> 34:49.149
No, no, no, no.

34:49.150 --> 34:52.223
Maybe you can play that
when Owen gets back.

34:53.520 --> 34:56.159
Maybe you can talk him out of it.

34:56.159 --> 34:57.960
I don't think it's a very good idea.

34:58.830 --> 35:01.239
- It's a great idea!

35:01.240 --> 35:05.189
Get to play with animals
and lie in the grass,

35:05.190 --> 35:06.590
and I can be with Owen.

35:08.740 --> 35:12.589
- No, the hippie, rebellious phase thing

35:12.590 --> 35:16.203
is just not very good for Owen.

35:17.230 --> 35:18.733
- All the kids do it.

35:20.796 --> 35:22.949
- The style, the short skirts,

35:22.950 --> 35:24.313
it's not very proper.

35:25.800 --> 35:26.939
I don't know.

35:26.940 --> 35:28.529
- Owen loves my skirt,

35:28.530 --> 35:30.303
says it looks really cute.

35:31.295 --> 35:32.843
- I'm sure he does.

35:33.858 --> 35:34.858
Here.

35:36.110 --> 35:40.939
Owen needs someone to take
care of him right now.

35:40.940 --> 35:42.779
- I care, I care so much.

35:42.780 --> 35:45.699
I love, I love Owen.

35:45.700 --> 35:48.379
I love him, but, I don't know

35:48.380 --> 35:49.893
how to get him to love me.

35:51.430 --> 35:55.149
- Well, sometimes boys,

35:55.150 --> 35:59.839
boys just can't see
when a girl likes them.

35:59.840 --> 36:02.419
Sometimes the girl has
to put effort into it

36:02.420 --> 36:06.339
and make some effort and
show him what he's missing.

36:06.340 --> 36:10.139
You could do what you did to me.

36:10.140 --> 36:11.935
I'm sure he'd love that.

36:13.095 --> 36:14.129
Ooh.

36:14.130 --> 36:15.380
Here, let's lay you down.

36:46.145 --> 36:49.665
- Owen, is there something
you'd like to tell me?

36:54.280 --> 36:55.280
Owen.

36:58.477 --> 37:00.163
Is there something you wanna tell me?

37:01.778 --> 37:02.979
Owen!

37:02.980 --> 37:03.980
- No.

37:07.030 --> 37:08.130
- Where have you been?

37:10.760 --> 37:14.189
- A habitat village, McGonagall Commune.

37:14.190 --> 37:15.120
- You're lying.

37:15.121 --> 37:16.769
I went there and you weren't there.

37:16.770 --> 37:18.909
- Maybe you went somewhere
else that I've been.

37:18.910 --> 37:19.743
- Where?

37:19.744 --> 37:22.659
- I don't know, State Dayton Commune.

37:22.660 --> 37:23.707
- State Dayton.

37:29.980 --> 37:32.639
Owen, tell me, how many secrets
are you keeping from me?

37:32.640 --> 37:34.509
Dayton Commune, Route Commune,

37:34.510 --> 37:36.919
I went to all of them
and you were at none!

37:36.920 --> 37:38.383
I mean, where did you go?

37:40.580 --> 37:41.980
- Where do you think I went?

37:43.373 --> 37:46.543
- I don't know, maybe to see another girl.

37:46.544 --> 37:47.956
- Yeah, what girl?

37:47.957 --> 37:49.529
- I don't know, you tell me.

37:49.530 --> 37:52.709
- Well, there is no girl.

37:52.710 --> 37:54.157
- I think you're lying.

37:55.363 --> 37:57.349
Did you just push me?

37:57.350 --> 37:58.183
- You know, you asked for it.

37:58.184 --> 37:59.559
I never wanted to get married.

37:59.560 --> 38:01.629
- Do the words I love
you mean nothing to you?

38:01.630 --> 38:04.299
- Grab the keys, get your stuff, and go.

38:04.300 --> 38:05.133
- No!

38:05.133 --> 38:06.060
We can make this work.

38:06.061 --> 38:07.176
We can just start over.

38:07.177 --> 38:09.249
- No, it's done, it is over.

38:09.250 --> 38:10.489
- No, just break it off
with the other girl.

38:10.490 --> 38:12.090
We can still be together.
- No.

38:13.370 --> 38:14.370
I don't want to.

38:15.170 --> 38:16.520
- So there is another girl.

38:19.610 --> 38:20.610
- Yeah.

38:22.520 --> 38:23.870
- I can't live without you.

38:25.260 --> 38:26.989
- Well, I don't need you.

38:26.990 --> 38:29.209
- Look, I know you need your space,

38:29.210 --> 38:30.639
but you need to take responsibility.

38:30.640 --> 38:31.520
You need to grow up!

38:31.521 --> 38:32.789
- Just go.
- No, I--

38:32.790 --> 38:33.790
- Leave!

38:37.633 --> 38:40.169
I don't usually fight women.

38:40.170 --> 38:41.889
Leave before I change my mind.

38:41.890 --> 38:43.723
- You're sick.

39:23.370 --> 39:24.370
- Who are you?

39:28.099 --> 39:29.099
What?

39:30.727 --> 39:32.213
What, what, you wanna fight?

39:33.970 --> 39:34.970
Bring it.

39:37.471 --> 39:39.021
- You think that's what I want?

39:39.889 --> 39:40.722
I'll tell you what I want.

39:40.723 --> 39:43.209
I want you to show Sarah some respect!

39:43.210 --> 39:44.043
- How do you know Sarah?

39:44.044 --> 39:45.069
- Do you love her?
- No.

39:45.070 --> 39:46.559
- Why not?
- I, I don't know.

39:46.560 --> 39:48.895
Is there a law that
says I have to love her?

39:48.896 --> 39:49.896
Oh, Jesus!

39:55.730 --> 39:57.039
Guy?
- No.

39:57.040 --> 39:58.419
- Guy, you're Guy!

39:58.420 --> 40:00.573
Guy, how are you?

40:03.140 --> 40:04.337
It's good to see you.

40:06.207 --> 40:08.109
How have you been?

40:08.110 --> 40:09.159
- Fine.
- Yeah?

40:09.160 --> 40:10.329
What's it, five years?

40:10.330 --> 40:11.679
- Yeah, man.
- Oh my God.

40:11.680 --> 40:12.823
Where have you been?

40:14.566 --> 40:15.566
- Whoa!

40:17.062 --> 40:18.538
- What?

40:18.539 --> 40:19.636
- Owen.

40:19.637 --> 40:21.136
- Oh, when we were kids!
- Yes, of course.

40:21.137 --> 40:23.399
- Oh my, I forgot about that.

40:23.400 --> 40:24.599
That's disgusting.
- Yeah, I know.

40:24.600 --> 40:25.860
- That's a nasty...

40:26.930 --> 40:28.551
- No, thanks, I'm tryin' to quit.

40:28.552 --> 40:29.385
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

40:29.386 --> 40:31.439
- How long's that been lasting?

40:31.440 --> 40:33.703
- It's been a week.

40:35.400 --> 40:36.523
So you and Sarah, huh?

40:37.630 --> 40:39.029
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:39.030 --> 40:39.920
- Where's she again?

40:39.921 --> 40:41.249
- What's that?
- She's gone?

40:41.250 --> 40:43.609
- Yeah, yeah, well, we got in a little--

40:43.610 --> 40:44.906
- Ooh.
- Yeah, a little tussle.

40:44.907 --> 40:47.099
- A tussle, yeah, she said that, yeah.

40:47.100 --> 40:49.979
- Yeah, yeah, it's all right.

40:49.980 --> 40:51.587
She'll come back.

40:51.588 --> 40:53.089
- Okay, great, so you talked to her

40:53.090 --> 40:54.659
and she'll be back, that's good.

40:54.660 --> 40:56.579
- I mean, she always does.

40:56.580 --> 40:57.659
She loves me.

40:57.660 --> 40:58.719
- She loves you.
- Yeah, of course.

40:58.720 --> 40:59.789
- Of course, yeah, you
guys love each other

40:59.790 --> 41:01.119
so she'll be back.

41:01.120 --> 41:02.680
- No, I mean, well she loves me.

41:04.170 --> 41:05.470
- You don't love her back.

41:07.393 --> 41:08.390
- I don't know.

41:08.390 --> 41:09.390
No.

41:10.740 --> 41:11.759
- What's not to love?

41:11.760 --> 41:15.777
I mean, she's beautiful,
she's kind, she cooks.

41:15.778 --> 41:17.189
Oooh, so good.

41:17.190 --> 41:18.190
Right?

41:21.280 --> 41:22.349
Okay.
- All right.

41:22.350 --> 41:23.940
- All right, I'll hold it.
- Hey.

41:27.864 --> 41:29.169
- No, you know what, no, no, it's okay.

41:29.170 --> 41:30.804
I'll--
- You're just gonna hold it?

41:30.805 --> 41:32.417
- Yeah, it's not--
- All right, sure.

41:32.418 --> 41:35.119
- I'll hold it like this.
- Okay, sure.

41:35.120 --> 41:36.699
- Where was I?

41:36.700 --> 41:37.999
Right.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.009
Imagine, you come home, your wife, Sarah,

41:40.010 --> 41:42.599
is in the kitchen cooking you some dinner,

41:42.600 --> 41:44.749
and your boys are out
front mowin' the lawn,

41:44.750 --> 41:45.853
playing some ball.

41:46.900 --> 41:47.929
It's a dream come true.

41:47.930 --> 41:50.599
- A dream until, you know,
your wife and kids leave you,

41:50.600 --> 41:52.150
and then what are you gonna do?

41:52.990 --> 41:56.199
- Well, why would they
leave you if you love them?

41:56.200 --> 41:57.239
- Hypothetically, you know.

41:57.240 --> 41:59.949
Like, what if they leave
you, then what do you do?

41:59.950 --> 42:01.939
- So you're gonna cut out
that entire part of your life

42:01.940 --> 42:03.313
because of a what if?

42:05.400 --> 42:07.329
- Well, I mean, if love's a tragedy

42:07.330 --> 42:09.009
why even start?

42:09.010 --> 42:10.539
- Owen, you're only gonna
get the life you want

42:10.540 --> 42:12.553
if you take the risks.

42:12.554 --> 42:13.554
- Okay.

42:16.230 --> 42:17.343
- And she loves you.

42:18.840 --> 42:21.279
And you leading her on like this is,

42:21.280 --> 42:22.280
it's not right, man.

42:23.400 --> 42:24.889
- Well, don't tell me what to do.

42:24.890 --> 42:25.890
- Yeah, well...

42:27.759 --> 42:28.592
I'll tell you what, pal.

42:28.593 --> 42:30.160
Since you're too much of a pansy,

42:33.010 --> 42:36.549
I'll do it, so you don't have to.

42:36.550 --> 42:37.969
- You'll do what?
- I'll live the dream.

42:37.970 --> 42:40.559
I'll have the girl, I'll have the kids.

42:40.560 --> 42:41.560
I'll marry Sarah.

42:42.500 --> 42:44.679
- You'll, you'll marry Sarah.

42:44.680 --> 42:45.781
- Yeah, I will.

42:45.782 --> 42:46.615
- There's gonna be a problem there,

42:46.616 --> 42:48.149
is that Sarah loves me, so--

42:48.150 --> 42:50.043
- I guess I'll have to take that risk.

42:53.247 --> 42:54.297
- All right, get out.

42:55.920 --> 42:56.989
Get the fuck outta my house.

42:56.990 --> 42:58.298
- Oh, come on, Owen, you don't wanna--

42:58.299 --> 43:00.299
- Get the fuck out, get out of my house!

43:02.030 --> 43:03.030
Now.

43:04.897 --> 43:05.897
- Fine.

43:16.780 --> 43:17.780
- Hey.

44:11.330 --> 44:14.153
- Hey, Linda.
- Hi!

44:16.399 --> 44:19.439
Ooh, look at you!
- You look great.

44:19.440 --> 44:21.949
- Thank you, you too.

44:21.950 --> 44:22.959
- So what do you think?

44:22.960 --> 44:26.169
- Oh, I love it, yeah.
- Great.

44:26.170 --> 44:27.329
- It's perfect.

44:27.330 --> 44:28.230
Thank you, so much--
- My pleasure.

44:28.231 --> 44:29.849
- For letting me stay here.

44:29.850 --> 44:30.830
- Owen is out of town right now

44:30.831 --> 44:32.419
for a couple of months,
and you can stay here

44:32.420 --> 44:33.909
while he's gone.

44:33.910 --> 44:35.749
And when he gets back, I promise

44:35.750 --> 44:38.300
I'll help you find somewhere else to live.

44:38.301 --> 44:39.339
- Okay.

44:39.340 --> 44:41.499
Well, if I can't,

44:41.500 --> 44:43.609
do you think I can maybe stay with you?

44:43.610 --> 44:45.389
Look, I promise I will pay rent.

44:45.390 --> 44:49.773
- It's not that, it's just, my fiancee.

44:50.870 --> 44:51.703
- Oh.
- Yeah.

44:51.704 --> 44:53.999
I wouldn't want her to, you know,

44:54.000 --> 44:57.179
get the wrong idea about who you are,

44:57.180 --> 45:00.039
how we met, how we know
each other, stuff like that.

45:00.040 --> 45:01.392
- You're afraid of your fiancee?

45:01.393 --> 45:03.199
- I am not afraid.

45:03.200 --> 45:04.200
I respect her.

45:05.550 --> 45:07.279
- Okay.
- Okay.

45:07.280 --> 45:10.359
- Well, it was just
'till I can find a place.

45:10.360 --> 45:12.949
- Okay, we'll see.

45:12.950 --> 45:14.013
So where you been?

45:14.965 --> 45:16.840
- Oh, traveling.

45:16.841 --> 45:21.173
Got a little caught up in the
whole hippie culture thing.

45:22.090 --> 45:25.253
So, I got a little lonely.

45:26.210 --> 45:27.379
Yeah.

45:27.380 --> 45:31.739
Thought I'd go back to my
roots and maybe settle down

45:31.740 --> 45:33.099
and start a family.

45:33.100 --> 45:34.499
- Well, you're lucky.

45:34.500 --> 45:37.009
There's a lotta great guys in this city.

45:37.010 --> 45:38.717
- Are they like you?

45:38.718 --> 45:41.743
- Yeah, I'm
sure they are pretty similar.

45:43.758 --> 45:46.809
- I thought maybe I'd go
back to being a nurse,

45:46.810 --> 45:48.959
or maybe a therapist.

45:48.960 --> 45:50.569
- Ooh, a therapist is good.

45:50.570 --> 45:52.743
Yeah, I could use a therapist.

45:54.986 --> 45:56.713
- What, who is this?

45:58.240 --> 46:01.669
- Oh, this is a picture of Owen's parents.

46:01.670 --> 46:03.749
- His father was a soldier?

46:03.750 --> 46:04.750
- Yeah.

46:05.465 --> 46:06.559
- Oh.

46:06.560 --> 46:07.803
What happened to his mom?

46:08.830 --> 46:09.780
- She was so heartbroken,

46:09.781 --> 46:12.899
she went and got married
to someone else right away.

46:12.900 --> 46:13.900
Left Owen.

46:15.630 --> 46:17.130
- How did Owen cope with that?

46:18.520 --> 46:19.520
- Not well.

46:21.790 --> 46:22.760
That's probably the reason why

46:22.761 --> 46:24.010
he hasn't gotten married.

46:24.950 --> 46:26.750
- He never married?
- No, not Owen.

46:28.277 --> 46:29.277
- Huh.

46:30.660 --> 46:33.040
Well, maybe he's just

46:34.760 --> 46:37.513
looking for that special someone.

46:42.110 --> 46:44.729
- Or maybe he's just,

46:44.730 --> 46:45.730
oh.

46:47.470 --> 46:49.520
Maybe he just doesn't wanna be abandoned.

46:50.400 --> 46:51.490
- Yeah, well...

46:55.230 --> 46:58.039
Look, either way, it looks like

46:58.040 --> 47:01.563
he's just tryin' to find
someone to fill the void.

47:06.470 --> 47:08.069
- Well, I better go.

47:08.070 --> 47:09.163
- Wait, no, Guy.

47:11.120 --> 47:13.158
It's been so long since I've seen you.

47:13.159 --> 47:14.499
Why don't,

47:14.500 --> 47:18.423
why don't we just sit and talk?

47:29.150 --> 47:30.150
Talk.

47:32.875 --> 47:34.082
- I'm gonna go.

47:34.083 --> 47:35.569
- Guy, look, I'm sorry.

47:35.570 --> 47:36.810
I didn't--
- Here, it's the key.

47:43.652 --> 47:45.569
It was good to see you.

47:47.422 --> 47:48.422
Bye, Linda.

48:09.457 --> 48:10.712
- What the?

48:10.713 --> 48:12.382
Oh my God!
- Whoa, no, no, no, no, no!

48:12.383 --> 48:13.622
Oh, I'm sorry.

48:13.623 --> 48:15.289
I, I,

48:15.290 --> 48:17.579
I'm Owen, I used to have,

48:17.580 --> 48:19.225
this is my old room.

48:19.226 --> 48:20.699
- Owen.

48:20.700 --> 48:22.759
Yeah, but what--
- I'm sorry.

48:22.760 --> 48:25.109
No, I'm not gonna harm you or anything.

48:25.110 --> 48:27.162
I just, this used to be my,

48:27.163 --> 48:27.996
I have a key.

48:27.997 --> 48:30.219
- I know who, I know your name.

48:30.220 --> 48:31.909
What are you doing here?

48:31.910 --> 48:33.149
Oh my God.
- Oh my God.

48:33.150 --> 48:35.719
I completely forgot that
this place was rented out.

48:35.720 --> 48:37.384
- You think?

48:37.385 --> 48:38.968
- I'm sorry.

48:39.834 --> 48:40.834
- Cou...

48:42.455 --> 48:44.919
Well, I have this place for two months.

48:44.920 --> 48:45.959
How did this happen?

48:45.960 --> 48:47.450
I don't--
- Yeah, no.

48:47.451 --> 48:49.437
- Can you turn around please?
- Oh, sure.

48:59.990 --> 49:02.175
Okay, just--
- Am I okay?

49:02.176 --> 49:04.451
Can I turn back around?

49:04.452 --> 49:05.445
- Yeah, just--

49:05.446 --> 49:08.149
- And let me
formally introduce myself.

49:08.150 --> 49:10.706
I'm sorry, yeah, I'm Owen.

49:10.707 --> 49:12.256
- Hi, Owen.
- Pleased to meet you.

49:12.257 --> 49:13.979
And your name again?

49:13.980 --> 49:16.463
- Linda.
- Oh my God, Linda.

49:17.710 --> 49:20.869
- Gus has said some nice things about you

49:20.870 --> 49:23.764
so I know you're not a
ax murderer or anything.

49:23.765 --> 49:26.270
- I am not, promise.

49:26.271 --> 49:28.421
I mean, the only ax I
got is my guitar, so.

49:29.655 --> 49:32.129
- Yeah, I heard you are quite the player.

49:32.130 --> 49:33.980
- Yeah, I mean, it's kinda what I do.

49:36.960 --> 49:38.210
You wanna hear somethin'?

49:40.320 --> 49:41.339
- Sure.

49:41.340 --> 49:42.813
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

49:42.814 --> 49:43.814
- Why not?

49:56.521 --> 49:57.819
You know what?

49:57.820 --> 49:58.653
This is weird.

49:58.653 --> 49:59.486
I am soaked.

49:59.487 --> 50:01.763
I gotta, I feel awful.

50:03.260 --> 50:04.807
I gotta get goin'.

50:05.660 --> 50:07.292
I'll leave you to get back to sleep.

50:07.293 --> 50:09.313
I am sorry for waking you up.

50:10.751 --> 50:14.273
You have a nice night, okay?

50:18.730 --> 50:21.429
- Look, I'm not sending
you out in the rain.

50:21.430 --> 50:23.953
That would make me feel really bad, so,

50:26.060 --> 50:27.699
this is your,

50:27.700 --> 50:30.619
you can spend the night tonight

50:30.620 --> 50:31.743
until you figure out.

50:33.110 --> 50:34.299
- Yeah?

50:34.300 --> 50:35.899
- I can't believe I just said that either,

50:35.900 --> 50:36.959
but sure.
- Oh my God.

50:36.960 --> 50:37.960
That would,

50:38.749 --> 50:40.173
that would be great.

50:41.510 --> 50:43.386
- Okay.
- I can sleep wherever.

50:43.387 --> 50:44.220
Wherever.

50:44.221 --> 50:45.643
The floor is perfectly fine.

50:46.950 --> 50:49.243
- All right, I'll grab you a blanket.

50:53.510 --> 50:55.349
- And I am harmless.

50:55.350 --> 50:57.213
- Yeah, that's what
they all say.

50:57.214 --> 50:59.130
- Don't you worry.

50:59.131 --> 51:00.214
- Okay, well.

51:02.904 --> 51:04.487
- Thank you, again.

51:05.613 --> 51:07.672
- You're welcome.

51:18.999 --> 51:19.999
- Mom?

51:21.841 --> 51:22.841
Dad?

51:24.809 --> 51:27.009
No, no, no, no, no!
- Owen, Owen.

51:27.010 --> 51:28.884
Shh, shh, shh.

51:28.885 --> 51:29.885
Hey.

51:31.536 --> 51:34.453
You must've had a nightmare.
- Ooh.

51:58.590 --> 52:00.129
Good morning.

52:00.130 --> 52:01.130
- Good morning.

52:02.630 --> 52:04.629
- I had a nightmare, huh?

52:04.630 --> 52:06.953
- Yeah, you had quite the nightmare.

52:08.170 --> 52:09.786
- Sorry about that.

52:09.787 --> 52:11.169
- That's okay.

52:11.170 --> 52:13.014
- That's embarrassing.

52:13.015 --> 52:14.015
- Oh, come on.

52:15.481 --> 52:16.481
Feelin' better?

52:18.020 --> 52:19.020
- Yeah.

52:20.380 --> 52:21.639
Yeah, thank you.

52:21.640 --> 52:22.640
- Cold.

52:29.619 --> 52:30.786
- There we go.

52:38.160 --> 52:40.233
I'm not warm enough for ya?

52:40.234 --> 52:41.915
- I'm gettin' there.

52:41.916 --> 52:44.916
- Oh yeah?

54:12.847 --> 54:14.790
- Scooch over.

54:14.791 --> 54:16.372
Ooh, great.

54:16.373 --> 54:20.103
That was wonderful.

54:33.640 --> 54:34.740
Can I play you a song?

54:36.740 --> 54:38.010
- Please do.

54:38.011 --> 54:39.936
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

54:39.937 --> 54:40.937

56:53.074 --> 56:54.699
- Hey,
I'm just playin' around.

56:54.700 --> 56:56.039
- Yeah.

56:56.040 --> 56:56.880
We've been playin' all day.

56:56.880 --> 56:57.880
- We have.

57:04.750 --> 57:06.869
So, you and Linda.

57:06.870 --> 57:07.870
That was quick.

57:08.630 --> 57:09.630
- Yeah, man.

57:10.650 --> 57:13.669
She's beautiful, attentive, funny.

57:13.670 --> 57:15.863
It's everything I've
ever wanted in a woman.

57:18.040 --> 57:20.119
- Do you really think
you love her, though?

57:20.120 --> 57:22.370
I mean, she's, like, 10
years older than you.

57:23.230 --> 57:24.909
- Yeah, but if you truly love someone

57:24.910 --> 57:25.960
age shouldn't matter.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.998
You know what I believe is I
believe she's a gift from God.

57:32.510 --> 57:33.770
Laugh it up.

57:36.050 --> 57:37.649
Stupid, but...

57:37.650 --> 57:38.739
- So you think she loves you

57:38.740 --> 57:40.523
the way that you love her?

57:42.570 --> 57:44.479
- Yeah.

57:44.480 --> 57:47.553
Why are you questioning our relationship?

57:50.500 --> 57:51.800
Let me tell you somethin',

57:52.750 --> 57:54.989
we're going to get married.
- Okay.

57:54.990 --> 57:56.929
- Mark my words.

57:56.930 --> 57:59.090
- Does she know you
don't want children, though?

58:03.930 --> 58:05.509
- I'm not gonna lie to her.

58:05.510 --> 58:07.023
She loves children, but,

58:08.588 --> 58:09.421
I don't know.

58:09.422 --> 58:10.889
I mean, she understands
where I'm comin' from

58:10.890 --> 58:13.659
and she's told me before that
she's not gonna get pregnant,

58:13.660 --> 58:16.173
so, yeah, yeah.

58:17.410 --> 58:20.189
Hey, whatever's goin'
on between Linda and I,

58:20.190 --> 58:21.540
you would never understand.

58:25.440 --> 58:26.440
- Ouch.

58:31.590 --> 58:34.359
Well, speaking of Linda,

58:34.360 --> 58:35.710
I've got somethin' for you.

58:37.930 --> 58:38.930
- From her?

58:40.300 --> 58:41.719
- You'll see.

58:41.720 --> 58:44.719
- See, she's always doin' these
surprise things and whatnot.

58:44.720 --> 58:45.783
This is awesome.

58:46.690 --> 58:48.690
Now see, this is what I'm talkin' about,

58:49.760 --> 58:52.179
a hand written letter.

58:52.180 --> 58:53.479
Who does that?

58:53.480 --> 58:54.313
Who does that?

58:54.314 --> 58:55.619
- Okay, okay.

58:55.620 --> 58:57.289
- And she could've given it to me herself

58:57.290 --> 58:59.179
but instead she had my best friend do it.

58:59.180 --> 59:00.153
- Just read it.

59:00.154 --> 59:02.093
- Come on, that's romantic.

59:04.010 --> 59:05.379
Okay, Dear Owen.

59:05.380 --> 59:09.399
I should probably call you Mister by now.

59:09.400 --> 59:12.063
There's a misunderstanding
between you and I.

59:13.030 --> 59:14.477
Okay.

59:14.478 --> 59:15.478
You know what?

59:20.470 --> 59:23.263
You're bein' a little bit
too touchy feely today.

59:25.440 --> 59:26.790
- Sorry about that.

59:30.560 --> 59:34.169
- I feel that the love
you have come to desire

59:34.170 --> 59:37.293
is the motherly love you never had.

59:38.990 --> 59:39.990
Huh?

59:41.190 --> 59:43.009
I need someone who will love me

59:43.010 --> 59:45.320
and build a life together as a partner

59:46.820 --> 59:51.199
and not someone who thinks of me

59:51.200 --> 59:52.923
as some form of mother.

59:56.760 --> 59:57.760
Wait.

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:05.223
I cannot be with you any longer.

01:00:07.398 --> 01:00:09.403
I wanna live the way things are now.

01:00:13.821 --> 01:00:14.670
- Owen.

01:00:14.671 --> 01:00:17.509
- Is she breaking up with me?

01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:18.613
- Stay strong.

01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:22.973
Okay, other women aren't
different than her.

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:26.789
- Why would she break up with me?

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:28.240
Everything's been going good.

01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:31.773
There is no reason for this.

01:00:33.002 --> 01:00:34.345
- I don't know.

01:00:34.346 --> 01:00:35.179
Hey, no matter--

01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:37.069
- Is she breaking up with me?

01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:40.639
- No matter what, I'm here for you, okay?

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:41.640
Hey.

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:44.773
- Why would she do this?

01:00:47.090 --> 01:00:49.409
- Ever since we went to Vegas,

01:00:49.410 --> 01:00:52.219
when I first saw you, I knew.

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:54.693
We were the best friends
when we were in the band,

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:57.273
and in life.

01:00:58.966 --> 01:01:01.125
- Why would she do this?

01:01:01.126 --> 01:01:02.126
- Hey.

01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:06.699
We can start our own band
together, go on a world tour.

01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:09.276
I can take you away from all this.

01:01:09.277 --> 01:01:10.277
- Oh, God!

01:01:12.906 --> 01:01:14.925
- That sound good, Owen?

01:01:17.917 --> 01:01:18.917
Hey.

01:01:19.806 --> 01:01:20.806
Come here.

01:01:24.310 --> 01:01:26.727
You can be with me now, okay?

01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:36.863
What's wrong?

01:01:36.864 --> 01:01:37.933
- Did you just kiss me?

01:01:39.848 --> 01:01:40.681
- Yeah.

01:01:40.682 --> 01:01:42.373
- Did you just fucking kiss me?

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.169
- I thought you liked it.

01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:47.170
- No.

01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:50.605
Did I just kiss a man?

01:01:50.606 --> 01:01:52.042
What the fuck is going on?

01:01:52.043 --> 01:01:53.043
- Hey, it's okay.

01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:55.209
- You need to leave.

01:01:55.210 --> 01:01:57.883
You need to leave, you need
to leave, you need to go.

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.190
Leave!

01:02:00.191 --> 01:02:01.790
- You don't mean that.
- Leave!

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.193
Now, leave.

01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:10.950
Leave!

01:02:25.977 --> 01:02:28.384
♪ Dah dah dah dah dah ♪

01:02:28.385 --> 01:02:30.745
♪ Dah dah dah, uh ♪

01:02:30.746 --> 01:02:33.762

01:02:36.881 --> 01:02:40.131
♪ I love you, yes I do ♪

01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:43.719
I'm glad you invited me here.

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.393
It was the right choice.

01:02:47.650 --> 01:02:48.650
- Hi, John.

01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:52.523
- Father Charlie.

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:57.103
- Thanks for the roses.

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:02.263
- You're welcome.

01:03:07.785 --> 01:03:08.785
- Sit.

01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:26.433
So, Owen's gone to the hospital
to be with his grandma.

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.693
He asked me to wait here to talk with you.

01:03:32.690 --> 01:03:34.431
- I don't understand.

01:03:34.432 --> 01:03:39.368
- In the eyes of the
Lord, you are a sick man.

01:03:39.369 --> 01:03:42.339
- There's some sort of
misunderstanding here.

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:44.563
I don't need to change for anybody.

01:03:51.539 --> 01:03:54.519
- Oh.

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:59.399
I've always wondered, why
did Linda give you the letter

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.453
and not Owen?

01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:08.409
- She gave it to me because she found out

01:04:08.410 --> 01:04:10.483
about Owen's mother fixation.

01:04:12.410 --> 01:04:13.963
She was disgusted.

01:04:15.706 --> 01:04:17.749
And she didn't wanna
argue with him about it,

01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:19.500
so she wanted me to give it to him.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.053
- You are a liar!

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:26.903
Linda came to me.

01:04:28.570 --> 01:04:30.499
She came to pray together.

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:35.500
She told me that you
approached her about Owen.

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:38.713
- So?

01:04:38.714 --> 01:04:40.889
She made her own choice.

01:04:40.890 --> 01:04:44.039
- A choice based on your lies!

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:46.879
You lied to her, and told her

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:51.653
that you and Owen were lovers.

01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:56.899
- This is between me and Owen.

01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:58.949
- This is between you and the Lord

01:04:58.950 --> 01:05:01.676
and he has final judgment,

01:05:01.677 --> 01:05:04.693
and so far he has found you lacking!

01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:10.463
Owen has made a decision.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.563
He does not want you in his life.

01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:18.253
- Nothing you can say can change my mind.

01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:21.559
I don't regret anything.

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:22.773
- You need to leave.

01:05:30.110 --> 01:05:31.643
Don't forget your flowers.

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.923
Your grandmother is no longer suffering.

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:54.707
She has been lifted up
to the Kingdom of Heaven.

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:06.973
- Her own daughter didn't
even come to the funeral.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.993
She's gonna regret that forever.

01:06:16.310 --> 01:06:20.149
- There are no regrets in
heaven, only salvation.

01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:22.788
Death is just the beginning.

01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:26.009
Yes, it's the end of our earthly toils,

01:06:26.010 --> 01:06:29.853
but it is the start of living
in the light of our Lord.

01:06:32.290 --> 01:06:33.290
Are you hungry?

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.667
Your grandmother would want you to eat.

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:06.883
I've known your grandmother
for a very long time.

01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:10.643
She sacrificed for you.

01:07:13.210 --> 01:07:17.733
She did everything to give
you the life you deserve,

01:07:19.310 --> 01:07:22.933
the life she wanted for you.

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:26.793
But without the Lord in your heart,

01:07:27.870 --> 01:07:31.343
you will not find that life.

01:07:39.223 --> 01:07:40.556
- I know, but...

01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:55.830
I just don't know what to do.

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:04.590
- Your grandmother wanted
me to give this to you.

01:08:07.889 --> 01:08:08.889
Open it.

01:08:45.773 --> 01:08:46.903
- What is this?

01:08:51.479 --> 01:08:54.209
- Your grandmother spent years

01:08:54.210 --> 01:08:55.983
looking for your mother and father.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:01.698
This letter, the books
and notebooks in that box,

01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:04.259
they have the details of where she went,

01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:07.419
who she talked to, what clues she found.

01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:10.679
Now, she didn't tell you about it

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:12.269
because she didn't wanna disappoint you.

01:09:12.270 --> 01:09:14.408
She was gonna give this to you

01:09:14.410 --> 01:09:16.193
when she found one of your parents.

01:09:17.290 --> 01:09:19.038
That never happened.

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:22.867
And now she wanted to
make sure that you got it.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.700
- All this time she's been
looking for my parents.

01:09:35.412 --> 01:09:36.412
I've,

01:09:38.770 --> 01:09:41.662
I've been searching for them for years.

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:54.243
- She knew about that hole in your heart,

01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:57.539
but she didn't wanna give you false hope.

01:09:57.540 --> 01:10:00.869
She thought it better to
keep it a secret from you

01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:01.933
what she was doing.

01:10:04.270 --> 01:10:06.270
She didn't wanna cause you anymore pain.

01:10:20.478 --> 01:10:22.728
- Can I show you something?

01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:48.870
- What's all this?

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:52.913
- Everywhere I've been over the years,

01:10:54.330 --> 01:10:55.330
searching.

01:10:57.790 --> 01:10:58.790
It's good to,

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:04.980
it's good to finally get to
talk to somebody about it.

01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:07.899
It's just been such a lonely thing.

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:12.900
I tried to tell Linda about it once or,

01:11:13.390 --> 01:11:15.192
I don't know, maybe twice.

01:11:15.193 --> 01:11:18.043
But I could never find the
right time or the right words.

01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:23.340
And it just, I guess it...

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:27.910
She just couldn't wait.

01:11:32.190 --> 01:11:33.643
She left, too.

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:38.460
- Linda loved you.

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.503
We talked.

01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:47.090
She never felt like that she
got a place in your heart,

01:11:48.317 --> 01:11:50.230
for when you truly love someone

01:11:52.130 --> 01:11:57.130
you share everything, you
share your dreams and desires,

01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:01.093
your fears, your losses.

01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:04.970
And she never felt like
you were open with her,

01:12:06.249 --> 01:12:09.773
and that's why she had to leave.

01:12:11.770 --> 01:12:13.359
- I know.

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:18.360
I know it wasn't her
fault, or anybody's fault.

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:20.160
It was mine.

01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:32.493
This was my mom's.

01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:41.580
- Not until you accept the
love of the Lord in your heart

01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:46.569
will you be able to see
what you are searching for

01:12:46.570 --> 01:12:47.713
with your eyes.

01:12:59.210 --> 01:13:00.830
- Father, look at this.

01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:04.527
Look at these places.

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:11.370
My grandmother's journal is full of...

01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:17.580
Look at this.

01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:21.353
Branson, Missouri, 1951.

01:13:22.421 --> 01:13:24.423
I was there in 1963.

01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:30.550
Look, here, Christmas 1952, Carmel.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.333
1964.

01:13:35.730 --> 01:13:39.103
Christmas, I remember that Christmas.

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:43.723
I got so mad at her for,

01:13:45.190 --> 01:13:46.703
for leaving me all alone.

01:13:51.050 --> 01:13:52.050
It's down there.

01:13:55.710 --> 01:13:57.619
- She must have really loved you

01:13:57.620 --> 01:13:59.559
to be willing to sacrifice time with you

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:03.600
on such a holy day, and such
a special day for a child.

01:14:13.768 --> 01:14:14.768
- It was,

01:14:18.333 --> 01:14:19.833
just a long search

01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:24.363
through so many different places,

01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:27.233
and talking to so many different people.

01:14:30.458 --> 01:14:31.458
I just feel like,

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:35.723
this is a waste.

01:14:44.339 --> 01:14:46.089
- I feel I have failed you, my son.

01:14:50.544 --> 01:14:52.629
I never have believed in you.

01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:57.489
I thought you going around
to all these different towns

01:14:57.490 --> 01:15:00.513
with different women and not
letting someone love you,

01:15:01.762 --> 01:15:02.962
I thought you were lost.

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:06.120
But now I know.

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:10.523
You were just looking for your parents,

01:15:13.203 --> 01:15:15.163
looking for that love you need.

01:15:18.810 --> 01:15:22.253
I beg your forgiveness
for not supporting you.

01:15:26.918 --> 01:15:27.918
- No, I,

01:15:29.568 --> 01:15:32.735
well, I was searching for a long time.

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:35.480
But it...

01:15:39.691 --> 01:15:40.524
I don't know.

01:15:40.525 --> 01:15:44.833
It just seemed like it
was all for nothing.

01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:50.871
I was just always so alone

01:15:50.872 --> 01:15:53.579
and without anything.

01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:55.733
The only thing I really ever had of him

01:15:56.675 --> 01:15:58.953
was my father's guitar.

01:16:02.363 --> 01:16:03.445
I don't know.

01:16:03.446 --> 01:16:07.613
I just,

01:16:10.303 --> 01:16:11.693
I just really felt alone.

01:16:18.770 --> 01:16:19.920
- You're wrong, my son.

01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:22.473
You were never alone.

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.709
Your mother gave birth to you.

01:16:25.710 --> 01:16:26.879
She nurtured you.

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:29.809
She made sure you were with
someone that loved you,

01:16:29.810 --> 01:16:31.489
someone that would take care of you,

01:16:31.490 --> 01:16:33.969
give you the opportunities and the chance

01:16:33.970 --> 01:16:36.693
for a happy life, that she couldn't.

01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:42.929
Your mother was always
with you in your heart.

01:16:42.930 --> 01:16:44.623
Her love was always there.

01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:49.390
So,

01:16:51.130 --> 01:16:52.430
what are you gonna do now?

01:16:56.629 --> 01:16:57.879
- I don't know.

01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:06.337
Maybe I'll get a dog.

01:17:06.338 --> 01:17:08.833
- That's wonderful.

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:12.849
Someone you could love and someone

01:17:12.850 --> 01:17:15.723
that could love you unconditionally.

01:17:17.153 --> 01:17:18.903
I think that's a great idea.

01:17:31.286 --> 01:17:33.453
- I thought I might leave.

01:17:44.650 --> 01:17:45.700
- Where would you go?

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:51.363
- My father's hometown.

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:57.450
I thought about maybe starting over.

01:18:08.937 --> 01:18:10.187
But until then,

01:18:11.717 --> 01:18:12.800
I don't know.

01:18:15.517 --> 01:18:17.460
- Would you ever come back?

01:18:22.027 --> 01:18:23.089
- I don't know.

01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:24.090
Yes.

01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:26.143
No, maybe.

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:34.500
I suppose if my parents
miraculously returned home,

01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:39.500
then so would I.

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:46.400
Until then,

01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:55.470
I'll just keep this with me.

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:02.179
- Well, I know a few things
about miracles, my son,

01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:05.379
and I will pray that you find the answers

01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:06.733
that you're looking for.

01:19:10.170 --> 01:19:13.263
And I always will be
there for you, my son.

01:19:18.770 --> 01:19:21.253
- Thank you, Father, thank you.

01:19:54.130 --> 01:19:55.130
How you doin'?

01:19:58.513 --> 01:19:59.513
You know,

01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:03.299
I figured out that there's pretty much

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:04.513
two paths in life.

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:08.803
This is my wisdom, listen up.

01:20:10.050 --> 01:20:11.900
Everything I've learned up until now.

01:20:12.770 --> 01:20:15.769
One, is that for some people

01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:17.899
life is a complete circle

01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:20.609
and comes all the way
back to the beginning.

01:20:20.610 --> 01:20:24.863
And for others, we exist in
some constantly wandering path.

01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:28.910
And the thing is,

01:20:31.390 --> 01:20:32.859
you don't really know which one you are

01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:34.060
until you get out there.

01:20:39.770 --> 01:20:41.870
I think it's time for us to get out there.

01:21:09.945 --> 01:21:11.259
I didn't tell you before,

01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:14.213
but I've been lookin' for my parents,

01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:17.750
for 40 years.

01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:22.717
I've stayed here in
this place for 40 years,

01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:28.299
and I think it's time for us to move on.

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:32.960
So, I'm gonna write down our new address

01:21:37.590 --> 01:21:40.770
and hopefully if they ever return

01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:46.330
we'll all get to be a family again.

01:21:49.114 --> 01:21:50.047
What do you think about that?

01:21:50.048 --> 01:21:51.193
Are you excited?

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.573
'Cause you look very excited.

01:22:00.423 --> 01:22:01.423
I know.

01:22:03.566 --> 01:22:06.359
You're cheering on the inside, aren't you?

01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:07.360
Yeah.

01:22:19.516 --> 01:22:20.516
Ooh.

01:22:23.627 --> 01:22:24.627
Come here.

01:22:25.421 --> 01:22:27.822
You ready for a little adventure?

01:22:27.823 --> 01:22:32.823
Yeah, I think
you're pretty cool too.

01:22:33.003 --> 01:22:34.703
Hey, can I play you a song?

01:22:36.694 --> 01:22:38.027
Play you a song?

01:22:49.849 --> 01:22:52.527
Anybody ever tell you
you're a good listener?

01:23:57.080 --> 01:24:00.327
Well, it's a work in progress anyway.

01:24:06.367 --> 01:24:07.867
You're a good boy.

01:26:00.612 --> 01:26:01.612
What?

01:26:02.460 --> 01:26:03.293
What?

01:26:03.294 --> 01:26:05.109
Don't look at me like that.

01:26:05.110 --> 01:26:07.549
You thought I was gonna leave you?

01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:09.799
I'm not goin' anywhere without you.

01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:10.633
Right?

01:26:10.633 --> 01:26:11.466
Yeah.

01:26:11.467 --> 01:26:14.568
No, I'm not, I'm not goin'
anywhere without you.

01:26:14.569 --> 01:26:15.402
You ready?

01:26:15.403 --> 01:26:16.620
Let's get outta here.

01:26:36.555 --> 01:26:37.888
- Remember this?

01:26:38.801 --> 01:26:40.749
Do you remember living here, Spence?

01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:41.879
Huh?

01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:43.330
Okay, I'm gonna set you down.

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:47.699
Okay, good boy.

01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:49.442
Do you remember?

01:26:49.443 --> 01:26:50.443
Huh?

01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:53.033
What do you think?

01:27:00.725 --> 01:27:04.063
Ooh, such a mess.

01:27:07.557 --> 01:27:08.557
Hm.

01:27:19.235 --> 01:27:21.453
Oh!

01:27:26.521 --> 01:27:28.021
It's a gramophone!

01:27:41.504 --> 01:27:42.604
Do you think it works?

01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:48.733
Let's try this.

01:27:54.662 --> 01:27:55.662
Okay.

01:28:02.955 --> 01:28:06.038
It works!

01:28:08.013 --> 01:28:10.180
All right, let's get busy.

01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:02.940
Owen.

01:29:03.700 --> 01:29:04.700
Hi, sweetheart.

01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:08.559
No, it's a big mess.

01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:10.760
Yeah, I know, they have
to come back, honey.

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:15.209
But tell 'em I love the color.

01:29:15.210 --> 01:29:16.519
All right.

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:18.353
Yes, we found the gramophone.

01:29:19.250 --> 01:29:21.829
Yeah.

01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:24.083
I wanna keep it, it's gorgeous.

01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:27.829
The TV?

01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:30.149
Nah, that's gotta go.

01:29:30.150 --> 01:29:32.009
No, we'll bring mine.

01:29:32.010 --> 01:29:33.669
Okay.

01:29:33.670 --> 01:29:34.670
All right, love.

01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:37.889
All right, we're comin' to get ya.

01:29:37.890 --> 01:29:38.890
We'll see ya soon.

01:29:39.850 --> 01:29:40.850
Bye bye.

01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:48.703
All right, let's go bring Owen home.

01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:18.288
Sorry to wake you up.

01:30:18.289 --> 01:30:20.779
- Ooh, it's a pleasure.

01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:21.799
You wanna do somethin' fun?

01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:23.189
- Yeah.

01:30:23.190 --> 01:30:24.023
- Yeah?

01:30:24.024 --> 01:30:27.143
- Let me close the curtains.

01:30:38.170 --> 01:30:39.719
Guitar?

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:41.629
You meant music?

01:30:41.630 --> 01:30:44.532
- Yeah, what did...

01:30:46.189 --> 01:30:47.559
What?

01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:48.560
Ooh, you!

01:30:51.031 --> 01:30:52.198
- I thought...

01:30:54.028 --> 01:30:55.382
- Later.
- Okay.

01:30:59.668 --> 01:31:00.866
- Yeah.

01:31:00.867 --> 01:31:01.770
- From the US military,

01:31:01.771 --> 01:31:04.396
soldiers missing in action
back to their homes.

01:31:04.397 --> 01:31:06.647
- Oh, and you know I
don't like war pictures.

01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:10.320
What are you watching?

01:31:10.321 --> 01:31:12.629
- I don't know, I fell asleep.

01:31:12.630 --> 01:31:14.603
- I lost half my family in the war.

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:18.033
No, I'm turning it off, Owen.
- Please do.

01:31:29.881 --> 01:31:32.619
- Owen, do you know somebody
at Belleview Hospital

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:34.043
in Seattle, Washington?

01:31:35.316 --> 01:31:36.527
- Belleview Hospital?

01:31:36.528 --> 01:31:38.528
- Do you know somebody
in Belleview Hospital?

01:31:49.410 --> 01:31:50.410
- Dear Owen.

01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:55.524
- Oh.
- Linda.

01:31:55.525 --> 01:31:56.525
Linda.

01:31:58.246 --> 01:32:00.259
Dear, dear Linda.

01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:02.029
- I'll give you some privacy.

01:32:02.030 --> 01:32:03.739
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:06.199
There's no secrets here.

01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:08.457
Sit, I'll share the letter with you.

01:32:11.393 --> 01:32:13.943
It says dear Owen.

01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:16.949
It's been quite a long time.

01:32:16.950 --> 01:32:18.699
Hope everything is okay.

01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:21.229
Now I hope you haven't moved yet.

01:32:21.230 --> 01:32:23.889
Either way, I truly hope
these words find you.

01:32:23.890 --> 01:32:25.940
The reason I wrote you is that I believe,

01:32:28.342 --> 01:32:29.973
I believe I found your mother.

01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:36.809
Influenced by my father, I, too,

01:32:36.810 --> 01:32:39.688
became a doctor, a psychiatrist.

01:32:39.689 --> 01:32:41.439
I came across a patient
who, unfortunately,

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:43.648
has 60 years of mental illness,

01:32:43.649 --> 01:32:45.405
she can't even remember her name.

01:32:45.406 --> 01:32:47.063
It's a miracle she survived at all.

01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:50.749
I recognized her heart-shaped pin.

01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:52.719
She doesn't let anyone touch it

01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:54.560
to the point that she
completely loses control.

01:32:56.498 --> 01:32:58.098
It takes two nurses to calm her.

01:33:00.170 --> 01:33:01.160
According to my father,

01:33:01.161 --> 01:33:02.579
the man who brought your mother here

01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:06.207
was a kind-hearted man who
found her after she fainted.

01:33:07.730 --> 01:33:09.759
It's heartbreaking that
there hasn't been much

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:11.813
we could do to improve her condition,

01:33:12.704 --> 01:33:17.169
but when I said your name,

01:33:17.170 --> 01:33:19.100
a subtle smile grew on her lips,

01:33:25.223 --> 01:33:27.413
and when I said the name of Matthew,

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:30.179
tears streamed down her eyes

01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:31.843
while she grabbed my hand.

01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:35.979
They found a map in her possession

01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:39.083
which I'm sending you a copy of,

01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:43.627
and I, along with a photo of her.

01:33:50.528 --> 01:33:52.028
Could that be you?

01:33:55.597 --> 01:33:57.189
- Owen, are you sure it's her?

01:33:57.190 --> 01:33:58.190
- No, I'm not.

01:34:00.365 --> 01:34:01.365
I'm not.

01:34:03.965 --> 01:34:05.029
I'm not certain.

01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:06.030
It could be.

01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:11.269
I do, I do recognize
that face in my grandma.

01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:13.916
That's the one that has the pin heart.

01:34:13.917 --> 01:34:17.156
I found it in grandma's picture in here.

01:34:17.157 --> 01:34:18.990
It's, it was in there.

01:34:20.090 --> 01:34:21.143
There's that pin.

01:34:22.707 --> 01:34:23.959
And see?

01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:24.960
The jawline.

01:34:26.543 --> 01:34:28.100
That may be Mom.

01:34:28.101 --> 01:34:31.316
- Owen, here's a picture of your mom.

01:34:31.317 --> 01:34:32.737
- Yes, I believe it's her.

01:34:34.812 --> 01:34:39.812
Yeah.

01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:44.320
It is!

01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:48.205
- Oh, Owen!

01:34:48.206 --> 01:34:49.310
- It's my mom!

01:34:49.311 --> 01:34:52.121
- Owen, it's your mother!
- Mom!

01:34:57.119 --> 01:34:58.119
This...

01:35:01.885 --> 01:35:03.802
Grandma taught me this.

01:35:06.551 --> 01:35:10.134
Used to sing this to
me when I was younger.

01:35:13.304 --> 01:35:16.156
Can I share a song with you?
- Sure.

01:35:18.063 --> 01:35:19.730
I'd love to hear it.

01:35:25.105 --> 01:35:27.462
- Grandma played this to me.

01:35:27.463 --> 01:35:29.180
