WEBVTT

00:00.260 --> 00:01.893
Previously on "Cardinal".

00:01.928 --> 00:02.961
What did you see?

00:02.996 --> 00:03.995
A white guy

00:04.030 --> 00:05.096
with blonde hair.

00:05.132 --> 00:06.730
You saw Terri get on the bus, right?

00:06.766 --> 00:08.565
I dropped her at the station.

00:08.600 --> 00:10.901
But my prints are all
over that kilo of coke.

00:10.936 --> 00:12.302
Make the fingerprints disappear,

00:12.337 --> 00:13.904
and I'll tell you what I got on Cardinal.

00:13.939 --> 00:15.238
We have confirmation.

00:15.274 --> 00:18.075
A rival moving in on the
Northern Raiders drug trade.

00:18.110 --> 00:19.409
I didn't know he was a dealer.

00:19.444 --> 00:20.410
Is there anything at all

00:20.445 --> 00:22.012
that you can tell us about him?

00:22.048 --> 00:24.113
He had like this crazy tooth.

00:24.149 --> 00:26.015
The Northern Raiders don't
own this town anymore.

00:26.051 --> 00:27.050
Toof.

00:27.085 --> 00:28.785
Keep your mouth shut about our plans.

00:29.821 --> 00:30.787
No!

00:30.822 --> 00:32.121
Never lose control.

00:33.558 --> 00:35.925
No one uses our product.

00:35.960 --> 00:38.161
Break any of my rules and I kill ya.

00:38.196 --> 00:39.861
You left your meds at home.

00:39.897 --> 00:41.296
Please, step back from the edge.

00:41.331 --> 00:42.497
I'm working.

00:42.532 --> 00:43.999
Jesus, John.

00:44.034 --> 00:45.466

03:27.455 --> 03:28.654
What have we got?

03:29.390 --> 03:30.455
Vic's been dead between twelve

03:30.490 --> 03:31.456
and twenty-four hours.

03:31.491 --> 03:32.457
Cause of death,

03:32.492 --> 03:34.159
either blunt force
trauma or gunshot wound.

03:34.194 --> 03:36.194
You'll understand when you see the body.

03:39.132 --> 03:41.121
This must be the kill site.

03:47.740 --> 03:48.939
You get a match on that

03:48.975 --> 03:50.341
and you call me right away.

03:50.376 --> 03:51.575
Hey.

03:52.144 --> 03:53.543
When did you get back?

03:54.419 --> 03:55.619
Last night.

03:56.715 --> 03:58.115
Call Ballistics, Ash.

03:58.150 --> 04:00.017
Give them a heads up we
got something coming in.

04:00.052 --> 04:01.886
I want a quick turnaround on this.

04:18.569 --> 04:19.702
Hey guys,

04:19.737 --> 04:20.935
check this out.

04:21.452 --> 04:23.372
Can I tell you how good I am?

04:23.407 --> 04:24.639
Maggot casing?

04:24.674 --> 04:25.874
Irrefutably.

04:26.676 --> 04:28.076
What's so exciting?

04:28.112 --> 04:29.844
The distance from the flesh.

04:29.880 --> 04:31.914
Maggots will eventually
fall off a dead body.

04:31.949 --> 04:32.915
But this little guy

04:32.950 --> 04:35.317
was eight feet from the corpse.

04:35.352 --> 04:36.851
Right inside a footprint.

04:36.887 --> 04:38.986
Looks like a work boot.

04:39.022 --> 04:41.155
Like the one Terri saw at the cave maybe.

04:41.190 --> 04:42.390
Size 10, I'd wager.

04:44.427 --> 04:46.227
Yeah, but why would a guy
have a maggot casing

04:46.262 --> 04:47.228
on his boot?

04:47.263 --> 04:48.429
My question exactly,

04:48.464 --> 04:50.097
which is why I'm taking this

04:50.133 --> 04:51.565
to the master of entomology.

04:52.302 --> 04:53.734
Chin.

04:53.769 --> 04:55.001
He'll be ecstatic.

05:04.379 --> 05:06.212
The guy has an extra incisor.

05:07.749 --> 05:10.050
Rachel Wells bought heroin from a dealer

05:10.085 --> 05:11.284
with a tooth like that.

05:12.219 --> 05:13.419
She OD'd.

05:15.629 --> 05:16.829
I'm sorry.

05:21.829 --> 05:23.462
No one stood up for her.

05:23.630 --> 05:24.830
You did.

05:25.085 --> 05:26.285
It wasn't enough.

05:27.501 --> 05:29.633
Jordan, her boyfriend, said
that she bought the drugs

05:29.669 --> 05:31.356
at the Corner Pocket.

05:32.172 --> 05:33.804
From a guy who had a,

05:35.241 --> 05:36.274
what do you call it,

05:36.309 --> 05:37.508
a snaggletooth?

05:40.057 --> 05:41.712
So maybe he's one of the new dealers

05:41.747 --> 05:43.314
trying to cut out the bikers.

05:43.350 --> 05:44.949
Lasalle's boys find him,

05:44.985 --> 05:46.816
beat some Intel out of him.

05:46.852 --> 05:47.817
Shoot him.

05:47.853 --> 05:49.286
Or the other way around.

05:50.489 --> 05:52.622
You knock somebody out
and then shoot him,

05:52.657 --> 05:54.091
that's one kind of person.

05:54.493 --> 05:56.793
You put two bullets in their brain

05:56.828 --> 05:58.462
and then bash their head in,

05:59.831 --> 06:01.264
what does that make you?

06:02.468 --> 06:03.665
Sadistic.

06:05.470 --> 06:07.303
Or maybe the owner of defective bullets.

06:09.107 --> 06:10.306
I'm betting on both.

06:18.282 --> 06:19.882
Thought you'd be happy.

06:23.487 --> 06:24.752
I got no complaints with you

06:24.787 --> 06:26.287
putting Lasalle out of business.

06:26.323 --> 06:29.457
Hey, did it together, Alan.

06:29.493 --> 06:30.691
No.

06:31.770 --> 06:34.738
A couple bikers get
roughed up in a turf war,

06:34.773 --> 06:36.840
nobody looks too closely at that.

06:36.875 --> 06:38.381
But the mutilation,

06:39.477 --> 06:40.709
the sacrifice,

06:41.947 --> 06:43.779
I can't be part of that, Ray.

06:45.783 --> 06:47.216
You're a big part of it.

06:50.588 --> 06:51.988
You've earned this.

06:57.094 --> 06:58.493
It's just the beginning.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.472
You know what, you keep it.

07:05.836 --> 07:06.801
I'm out.

07:06.837 --> 07:08.603
There is no out. Take it or leave it.

07:08.638 --> 07:10.072
I held up my end of the deal.

07:10.107 --> 07:12.999
You work for me now, Alan.

07:15.644 --> 07:16.844
Alive or dead.

07:17.866 --> 07:19.098
It's your choice.

07:25.821 --> 07:27.021
So,

07:27.656 --> 07:29.289
what do ya got for me?

07:35.697 --> 07:37.816
Cops found, uh, your friend Toof

07:39.134 --> 07:40.533
with his head caved in.

07:42.536 --> 07:43.768
What else?

07:47.274 --> 07:49.108
Been looking for Leon's truck.

07:55.449 --> 07:56.648
What about the redhead?

07:57.718 --> 07:58.950
Terri Tait?

08:02.288 --> 08:03.687
So you did shoot her.

08:05.492 --> 08:06.891
The hell'd you do that for?

08:07.894 --> 08:09.727
She had nothing to do with Lasalle.

08:10.497 --> 08:11.695
Where is she?

08:16.636 --> 08:18.469
She's in protective custody.

08:20.372 --> 08:22.205
I don't even know where.

08:26.311 --> 08:27.511
Find her.

09:29.019 --> 09:31.186
So, Jordan gave us a description

09:31.221 --> 09:33.020
of Rachel Wells's dealer.

09:33.055 --> 09:35.222
I followed up at the Corner Pocket,

09:35.257 --> 09:37.894
one of the regulars ID'd him as "Toof".

09:41.730 --> 09:42.930
Sergeant?

09:45.367 --> 09:46.533
Who is this?

09:46.568 --> 09:47.701
Our shooting Vic.

09:47.736 --> 09:49.836
There's only one "Toof"
alias in Northern Ontario,

09:49.871 --> 09:51.070
Morris Tilley.

09:51.539 --> 09:53.306
Local. Low level pot dealer.

09:53.341 --> 09:55.674
Is he connected with
the Northern Raiders?

09:55.710 --> 09:56.843
Ah, Clegg says no.

09:56.878 --> 09:59.411
But we do think he's connected
to a drug operation

09:59.447 --> 10:01.543
who are taking over from the bikers.

10:02.434 --> 10:03.632
We're still digging.

10:05.103 --> 10:06.301
Sounds promising.

10:32.328 --> 10:33.494
Morris is a good boy,

10:33.529 --> 10:37.664
you know, maybe too
fond of that marijuana.

10:37.700 --> 10:40.915
I-I-I tell him all the time to lay off.

10:41.703 --> 10:43.918
Always puts you in a fog.

10:47.008 --> 10:48.208
Mrs. Tilley.

10:49.478 --> 10:51.111
I'm sorry but your son is dead.

10:54.282 --> 10:55.248
We found him this morning

10:55.283 --> 10:56.749
on the edge of the forest,

10:56.784 --> 10:58.725
just off the 17.

11:00.787 --> 11:01.987
What?

11:02.856 --> 11:03.955
No.

11:03.991 --> 11:06.399
No, he's not.

11:06.693 --> 11:08.494
He was just here

11:08.529 --> 11:09.495
the other day

11:09.530 --> 11:11.571
wolfing down a sandwich.

11:12.466 --> 11:14.065
No, your son was murdered.

11:16.702 --> 11:18.995
He's a sweet boy.

11:20.206 --> 11:21.839
He never hurt anybody.

11:23.409 --> 11:25.109
Could you tell us about

11:25.145 --> 11:28.779
anyone he was friends with,

11:28.814 --> 11:30.814
um might have been hanging around with.

11:32.484 --> 11:33.683
I don't know.

11:33.708 --> 11:36.387
Ah, he moved out two months ago.

11:37.322 --> 11:38.921
Was he living with anyone?

11:40.526 --> 11:42.359
Um...

11:43.395 --> 11:46.481
Leon ah-ah-ah something.

11:47.332 --> 11:48.531
And uh-

11:49.667 --> 11:51.667
a native friend.

11:53.671 --> 11:54.870
A fancy name.

11:56.174 --> 11:58.993
Uh, Toof said he was psychic.

11:59.843 --> 12:01.043
Um-

12:02.380 --> 12:03.579
Northwind.

12:04.582 --> 12:07.882
Yeah, that was it.

12:17.093 --> 12:19.889
Do you have family or friends nearby?

12:21.130 --> 12:23.129
You shouldn't be alone right now.

12:30.639 --> 12:32.472
Is-is Terri there?

12:33.709 --> 12:34.908
Terri Tait.

12:35.211 --> 12:36.610
She works there.

12:36.645 --> 12:37.844
I'm her brother.

12:37.879 --> 12:39.079
Yeah.

12:43.318 --> 12:44.550
The-

12:45.152 --> 12:47.250
The-the cops said what?

12:49.457 --> 12:50.690
No. No, thank you.

12:50.725 --> 12:52.024
That's fine.

12:52.059 --> 12:53.226
Thank you.

13:25.291 --> 13:26.490
Give me a sec.

13:28.594 --> 13:29.560
Well I'd offer you a beer

13:29.595 --> 13:31.427
but uh, you probably shouldn't drink.

13:32.631 --> 13:34.063
You're sending your boys to the rez

13:34.098 --> 13:35.498
looking for drug dealers.

13:37.101 --> 13:38.401
Tell me what you know about the guys

13:38.436 --> 13:40.035
moving in on your territory.

13:41.373 --> 13:43.205
I don't know what you're talking about.

13:44.509 --> 13:46.517
You think they're Native.

13:47.278 --> 13:48.477
Why?

13:54.217 --> 13:56.944
I know how close you and Wombat were.

14:00.658 --> 14:02.491
They cut off your
brother's head off, man.

14:06.195 --> 14:07.828
So tell me what you know.

14:09.137 --> 14:10.337
And then what?

14:10.800 --> 14:13.367
We can offer you protection.

14:13.403 --> 14:15.296
Before this escalates.

14:19.074 --> 14:21.302
I'm sorry, man, I can't help you.

14:22.838 --> 14:24.070
Fine.

14:25.547 --> 14:26.746
The offer remains.

14:27.416 --> 14:28.648
In the meantime,

14:29.150 --> 14:31.651
you set one more foot on my rez,

14:31.687 --> 14:33.606
I'm coming for ya.

14:50.438 --> 14:51.903
I can now link your first body

14:51.939 --> 14:54.239
to your second body through DNA results.

14:54.274 --> 14:56.140
But we didn't give you DNA.

14:56.175 --> 14:58.175
Abby Harris gave me a maggot casing.

14:58.211 --> 14:59.910
We have the same DNA at both sites.

14:59.946 --> 15:01.045
Whose DNA?

15:01.080 --> 15:02.447
The fly's.

15:02.482 --> 15:04.349
So the same species of
fly can be found at both sites.

15:04.384 --> 15:05.350
No.

15:05.385 --> 15:07.652
The DNA of the same individual fly.

15:07.687 --> 15:09.654
The maggot that came out of this casing,

15:09.689 --> 15:11.522
found in the footprint at
the second murder site,

15:11.558 --> 15:13.657
has the same mother as
dozens of other eggs

15:13.692 --> 15:15.225
found at the first site.

15:15.260 --> 15:17.160
Chin's evidence
confirms that Toof's killer

15:17.195 --> 15:18.729
was also at the waterfall.

15:18.764 --> 15:20.196
We're waiting on ballistics,

15:20.232 --> 15:21.732
but I'm betting the
bullets in Toof's brain

15:21.767 --> 15:23.066
match the one in Terri's.

15:23.101 --> 15:24.501
So you got one guy shooting people

15:24.536 --> 15:25.769
and dumping the bodies.

15:25.804 --> 15:27.604
And another guy who's
chopping up his vics

15:27.639 --> 15:29.205
to gain spiritual power.

15:29.241 --> 15:30.205
At least two.

15:30.241 --> 15:31.841
Working together.

15:31.876 --> 15:33.709
And the ritualistic one

15:33.745 --> 15:36.679
likes to make his sacrifices
under a new moon.

15:36.714 --> 15:37.747
Sacrifices?

15:37.782 --> 15:39.749
That's definitely not part
of any Native ceremony

15:39.784 --> 15:40.983
that I know of.

15:41.819 --> 15:43.085
Any suspects?

15:43.120 --> 15:45.855
Toof's mom said he
was staying with a "Leon"

15:45.890 --> 15:46.855
and a,

15:46.890 --> 15:48.723
a Native guy named "Northwind".

15:48.759 --> 15:50.291
Doesn't ring any bells.

15:50.326 --> 15:52.852
Northwind is a big name
on the Moose Bay rez.

15:53.963 --> 15:55.530
We think that the
heroin's being shipped up

15:55.565 --> 15:56.931
from a rez in Michigan, right?

15:58.902 --> 16:00.101
Yeah.

16:00.904 --> 16:03.704
This could be a brotherhood thing.

16:03.739 --> 16:06.540
Native dealer wants to do
business with his own people.

16:06.575 --> 16:08.275
So he gets rid of the white guy.

16:08.310 --> 16:11.144
Could be how
Northwind cuts out the bikers.

16:11.179 --> 16:13.313
We have two days until the new moon.

16:13.348 --> 16:16.283
We have to find Leon and
Northwind before then.

16:16.318 --> 16:18.318
It's been a while since
I've been to Moose Bay.

16:20.322 --> 16:21.521
Hey.

16:21.756 --> 16:22.955
Hm?

16:23.758 --> 16:25.343
I heard about Rachel.

16:27.161 --> 16:28.994
I should've pulled her out sooner.

16:32.133 --> 16:33.332
Yeah.

16:59.232 --> 17:00.431
You're lucky.

17:01.634 --> 17:03.067
The drugs were incinerated.

17:03.803 --> 17:05.702
Only thing left was a

17:05.738 --> 17:07.538
fingerprint card and a

17:07.573 --> 17:08.973
photo of the prints.

17:12.077 --> 17:13.276
So.

17:15.646 --> 17:17.770
You had something to tell me.

17:18.650 --> 17:19.882
Yeah.

17:30.061 --> 17:31.427
I have a friend

17:31.462 --> 17:32.894
works in lock-up.

17:35.466 --> 17:38.633
She says you signed out
a box of cold case files

17:38.669 --> 17:39.634
but failed to mention

17:39.670 --> 17:41.670
you'd hidden another case inside of it.

17:43.474 --> 17:46.240
Things get misfiled all the time.

17:46.276 --> 17:47.442
You lied.

17:47.477 --> 17:48.676
You stole evidence.

17:49.980 --> 17:51.412
And you're on tape.

17:55.785 --> 17:57.418
You are exactly

17:58.921 --> 18:00.754
what I thought you were.

18:01.857 --> 18:04.491
Lise Delorme is an
excellent investigator.

18:04.526 --> 18:06.360
NIS will be happy to have her.

18:06.528 --> 18:07.760
She was good.

18:08.930 --> 18:11.098
I'm sorry I put her in your path.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.133
They make their decision
today, don't they?

18:29.150 --> 18:30.349
Chief Northwind?

18:32.053 --> 18:33.252
That's me.

18:34.555 --> 18:35.953
Jerry Commanda.

18:35.989 --> 18:38.056
Ndishnikaaz.

18:38.091 --> 18:39.724
Aaniishna Nishkaa?

18:40.994 --> 18:42.193
You're OPD.

18:42.562 --> 18:43.995
Out of Algonquin Bay.

18:47.370 --> 18:50.071
I'm trying to locate a man
by the name of Northwind.

18:50.107 --> 18:51.906
But I don't know his first name.

18:52.490 --> 18:54.408
And we think he's taken
over the heroin trade

18:54.443 --> 18:55.843
in Algonquin Bay.

18:56.645 --> 18:58.745
Northwinds are good people.

18:58.781 --> 18:59.980
Traditional.

19:03.786 --> 19:05.586
You ever heard of uh-

19:07.023 --> 19:08.923
the Northern Raiders?

19:14.896 --> 19:16.162
You see, a few days ago

19:16.198 --> 19:17.697
we found the severed head of one them

19:17.732 --> 19:19.892
in some drug dealer's house.

19:20.643 --> 19:22.812
We think that Northwind has
something to do with it.

19:24.372 --> 19:26.338
Without a first name,

19:26.373 --> 19:28.192
I really can't help you.

19:29.777 --> 19:31.944
Respectfully, I think you can.

19:31.979 --> 19:34.115
I got nothing to say.

19:43.990 --> 19:45.709
Did he threaten you?

19:53.399 --> 19:57.721
Yesterday I took the body
of a girl to the morgue.

19:59.072 --> 20:00.837
She overdosed on heroin

20:00.873 --> 20:03.310
probably sold to her from this guy.

20:08.113 --> 20:10.609
He's killing children.

20:15.854 --> 20:17.253
All I need is his name.

20:24.428 --> 20:25.627
Ray.

20:26.864 --> 20:28.063
Ray Northwind.

20:29.533 --> 20:31.133
He's not one of us.

20:34.037 --> 20:35.236
Where's he from?

20:36.206 --> 20:38.721
The guy just turned up here one day,

20:39.376 --> 20:41.842
he showed me his status card.

20:41.878 --> 20:44.685
Wanted me to say that I was his uncle.

20:46.049 --> 20:48.883
Said some Peter Crowchild was gonna call,

20:48.919 --> 20:52.185
Chippewa from Iron River.

20:52.221 --> 20:55.029
I had to say that he was
born and raised here.

20:56.125 --> 20:57.090
What did you say?

20:57.126 --> 20:58.858
What do you think?

20:58.894 --> 21:00.093
Kicked him out.

21:03.065 --> 21:04.413
The next day,

21:05.573 --> 21:07.180
I wake up.

21:08.663 --> 21:10.495
There was this sound at the door.

21:13.274 --> 21:14.974
You ever hear the sound a dog makes

21:15.009 --> 21:17.051
with his paws cut off?

21:22.417 --> 21:23.891
My grandkids over there.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.395
He knew their names.

22:05.190 --> 22:06.489
Ah-

22:06.524 --> 22:09.959
I'm looking for John Cardinal.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.394
Ah, he's not here.

22:14.732 --> 22:16.443
You must be Catherine.

22:18.335 --> 22:19.534
How do you know John?

22:19.636 --> 22:20.802
I'm Tammy.

22:22.165 --> 22:23.364
Lidstrom.

22:24.541 --> 22:26.870
I used to go out with Kyle Corbett.

22:30.147 --> 22:31.346
Ah-

22:32.149 --> 22:33.680
Can-can you just-

22:33.716 --> 22:35.516
Can you give this to John?

22:35.551 --> 22:37.423
Tell him I can't take it.

22:39.155 --> 22:41.760
You look like you could use a cup of tea.

22:57.372 --> 23:00.904
I burned through the
last of the money John gave me.

23:03.178 --> 23:06.146
And I didn't know what
I was going to do and,

23:06.181 --> 23:07.379
then he called.

23:08.382 --> 23:09.981
Said his partner

23:10.017 --> 23:12.583
was paying the price for what he did.

23:14.021 --> 23:14.986
Lise Delorme?

23:15.022 --> 23:18.157
Yeah, she was investigating him.

23:18.192 --> 23:20.225
Thought he was dirty.

23:20.261 --> 23:23.010
When he was covering up
for your phone call.

23:23.697 --> 23:26.164
I know he felt responsible
for that officer's death,

23:26.199 --> 23:30.768
but all he ever wanted
was to protect you.

23:31.404 --> 23:33.103
And I used that.

23:35.608 --> 23:37.691
I don't want to be that person anymore.

23:46.146 --> 23:52.116
(Ethereal Instrumental

24:13.905 --> 24:15.105
Anything biting?

24:16.074 --> 24:17.507
I'm parking the truck for now.

24:19.377 --> 24:20.876
You gave me that truck.

24:20.911 --> 24:22.111
It's mine.

24:22.680 --> 24:24.079
I said, I'm parking it.

24:25.616 --> 24:28.383
Take the other car, go into town,

24:28.418 --> 24:29.827
wait for my call.

24:30.554 --> 24:31.954
I'll have an address for you.

24:34.732 --> 24:36.250
Have faith, Leon.

24:37.874 --> 24:39.706
Even when you think you've messed up,

24:40.530 --> 24:43.898
you find out it's all
part of a bigger plan.

24:49.773 --> 24:51.372
Leon Rutkowski.

24:51.407 --> 24:54.108
Did eight years for running
heroin and aggravated assault.

24:54.144 --> 24:55.375
In Collins Bay.

24:56.545 --> 24:58.378
His time overlapped Kevin Tait's.

24:59.523 --> 25:02.415
How many Leons in Algonquin Bay with both

25:02.450 --> 25:04.685
assault and drug charges on their record?

25:04.720 --> 25:06.186
He's the only one.

25:06.221 --> 25:08.055
Don't suppose he owns a black truck?

25:08.256 --> 25:10.659
No vehicles registered under his name.

25:11.726 --> 25:12.692
Let's get a BOLO out.

25:12.727 --> 25:14.121
Leon Rutkowski.

25:15.129 --> 25:16.528
- Delorme.
- Mhm?

25:16.564 --> 25:18.197
I just got off the phone with NIS.

25:18.232 --> 25:20.794
They want you in Ottawa next month.

25:21.235 --> 25:22.301
I got it?

25:22.336 --> 25:23.435
Apparently somebody over there

25:23.470 --> 25:24.704
changed their mind.

25:24.739 --> 25:25.938
Congratulations.

26:33.804 --> 26:35.637
Okay. Thanks.

26:35.672 --> 26:36.871
You're welcome.

27:13.373 --> 27:15.240
Commanda got a hit on Northwind.

27:15.276 --> 27:16.508
First name, Ray.

27:19.506 --> 27:20.705
Yeah.

27:22.783 --> 27:24.016
John.

27:30.756 --> 27:31.956
I need to know.

27:33.860 --> 27:36.513
What did you do to make
Musgrave back off?

27:39.699 --> 27:40.764
You got it.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.233
That's all that matters.

27:44.237 --> 27:45.457
- Yeah.
- All right.

27:45.493 --> 27:46.536
Listen,

27:46.771 --> 27:49.605
you were right about Wasserstein.

27:50.709 --> 27:51.708
We could've Skyped.

27:51.743 --> 27:53.576
I went to Toronto to find Catherine.

27:57.615 --> 27:58.740
Was she?

27:58.775 --> 27:59.816
It was a mistake.

28:07.725 --> 28:09.558
Things shouldn't be hard for you

28:10.928 --> 28:12.294
because of-

28:12.330 --> 28:13.562
because of this.

28:14.798 --> 28:16.232
It's too late for that.

30:31.680 --> 30:32.880
That's him.

30:33.449 --> 30:34.949
He dumped me in the cave.

30:37.452 --> 30:39.419
Leon Rutkowski?

30:39.454 --> 30:41.454
Or the name Ray Northwind?

30:43.458 --> 30:44.657
I don't think so.

30:45.660 --> 30:47.693
Does he have Kevin?

30:47.729 --> 30:49.262
Do you know where he is?

30:49.298 --> 30:51.431
That's what we're trying to find out.

31:12.485 --> 31:13.684
Oh.

32:29.758 --> 32:30.957
Oh.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.368
Yo. Jesus Christ. Dude!

32:42.404 --> 32:43.602
Hey.

32:43.838 --> 32:45.471
What happened to you?

32:45.507 --> 32:46.739
Nothing man.

32:46.841 --> 32:48.241
I went for a hike.

32:49.344 --> 32:52.245
Dude, your face.

32:56.182 --> 32:57.782
Oh, ah-

32:59.586 --> 33:00.952
I fell off a rock.

33:00.987 --> 33:02.421
I guess I hit my head.

33:02.456 --> 33:03.655
Hm.

33:05.426 --> 33:07.426
Where you been, you been selling?

33:07.594 --> 33:09.761
I just had some stuff to do in town.

33:09.796 --> 33:11.128
Oh nice.

33:11.164 --> 33:13.397
You uh, you got any extra stash?

33:13.433 --> 33:14.565
I got some guys interested and I'm-

33:14.600 --> 33:16.144
I'm running low.

33:20.806 --> 33:22.973
You better not be using again, Kev.

33:23.008 --> 33:24.308
No, no.

33:24.343 --> 33:25.609
I'm not.

33:25.644 --> 33:26.810
I swear.

33:26.845 --> 33:28.010
It's just-

33:28.046 --> 33:29.845
business is booming

33:29.881 --> 33:31.159
and I'm all out.

33:32.255 --> 33:33.455
Go talk to Ray.

33:34.425 --> 33:35.624
Okay.

33:37.789 --> 33:39.456
Aw man,

33:39.491 --> 33:40.890
he got rid of my truck?

33:42.713 --> 33:43.912
Guess so.

33:44.628 --> 33:46.195
Alright,

33:46.230 --> 33:47.963
go get some ice for your head,

33:47.998 --> 33:49.264
you look like shit.

33:49.300 --> 33:51.133
Ha. Sure. Okay.

34:04.426 --> 34:05.625
Online shopping?

34:07.296 --> 34:08.529
What's up, Jerry?

34:08.650 --> 34:12.320
This guy calling himself Ray Northwind,

34:12.355 --> 34:13.993
posing as Anishnaabe.

34:14.591 --> 34:15.822
Wait, wait.

34:15.858 --> 34:17.056
He's not from Moose Bay?

34:17.092 --> 34:19.726
He's not from anywhere I can find.

34:19.761 --> 34:21.161
I think he's pretending to be Indian

34:21.196 --> 34:24.030
to get a deal from the
supplier down in Michigan.

34:24.251 --> 34:25.451
Who's that?

34:25.667 --> 34:27.257
Peter Crowchild.

34:27.569 --> 34:29.175
Iron River Rez.

34:30.851 --> 34:32.250
That's good work.

34:33.908 --> 34:35.841
You know, I'm thinking that

34:35.876 --> 34:41.380
Crowchild is flying the
heroin across Lake Huron,

34:41.415 --> 34:43.849
up the French River to Lake Nipissing,

34:43.884 --> 34:45.917
where he does the hand-off to uh,

34:45.953 --> 34:47.719
"Ray Northwind".

34:47.755 --> 34:50.222
Keeps the shipments out
of federal jurisdiction,

34:50.257 --> 34:52.090
both sides of the border.

34:53.693 --> 34:54.725
Does Cardinal have any leads

34:54.761 --> 34:56.194
on Northwind's real identity?

34:56.228 --> 34:57.629
He's working on it.

35:54.751 --> 35:55.950
Cath?

35:56.986 --> 35:58.286
Hi.

35:58.529 --> 35:59.728
You're back.

36:02.191 --> 36:03.895
I'm making stir fry.

36:11.020 --> 36:13.279
Did you hit traffic on the way?

36:14.870 --> 36:16.103
No.

36:21.209 --> 36:22.975
I saw your medicines

36:23.010 --> 36:25.111
in the cabinet and I thought

36:25.146 --> 36:26.546
you had stopped taking them.

36:31.686 --> 36:34.753
You embarrassed me in
front of my students.

36:34.788 --> 36:36.344
What was I to do?

36:37.291 --> 36:38.257
You wouldn't answer your phone.

36:38.292 --> 36:39.491
I was working.

36:43.731 --> 36:45.631
I have to be able to reach you.

36:45.666 --> 36:46.632
If something were to happen-

36:46.667 --> 36:48.700
I'm fine.

36:48.736 --> 36:50.984
Why can't you see that?

36:53.806 --> 36:55.172
The signs-

36:55.207 --> 36:56.540
The signs were there-

36:56.576 --> 36:58.574
Because you were looking for them.

37:04.550 --> 37:06.165
You wanted to protect me.

37:06.874 --> 37:08.918
And I'm grateful for that.

37:10.586 --> 37:12.255
But where's the freedom-

37:13.214 --> 37:15.325
For either of us?

37:32.258 --> 37:33.691
How's Lise doing?

37:36.402 --> 37:37.601
Delorme?

37:39.464 --> 37:41.831
NIS wants her in Ottawa next month.

37:41.866 --> 37:43.327
Special training.

37:47.118 --> 37:48.718
She'll be hard to replace.

38:01.085 --> 38:03.222
This is one of the good times.

38:06.090 --> 38:07.489
There are so few.

38:09.493 --> 38:11.327
And we both know, they never last.

38:50.931 --> 38:52.131
Cardinal.

38:56.971 --> 38:58.404
Send me the coordinates.

38:58.439 --> 38:59.739
I'm on my way.

39:15.489 --> 39:16.454
Anybody in the truck?

39:16.490 --> 39:17.522
No.

39:17.557 --> 39:18.956
The car's registered to Raymond Bedford.

39:18.992 --> 39:20.625
Delorme's running his details.

39:20.661 --> 39:22.058
Good job spotting it.

39:29.535 --> 39:30.734
Anything yet?

39:31.837 --> 39:34.171
The connection's bad out here.

39:34.206 --> 39:36.039
I'm sure NIS will be better equipped.

39:39.511 --> 39:41.377
You should have stayed out of it.

39:41.413 --> 39:43.245
And let you take the hit.

39:44.081 --> 39:45.281
It was my choice.

39:46.017 --> 39:47.850
I won't be the one holding you back.

39:51.308 --> 39:52.508
Here he is.

39:55.059 --> 39:56.627
Raymond Bedford.

39:58.028 --> 39:59.227
Ray Northwind.

40:01.532 --> 40:04.433
There's drug paraphernalia in the truck.

40:04.468 --> 40:06.554
Traces of heroin.

41:30.516 --> 41:31.715
Rules, Kevin.

41:40.525 --> 41:42.925
Maybe your brother thinks you're dead.

41:43.317 --> 41:45.461
I mean, it's weird that he
hasn't checked the hospitals

41:45.496 --> 41:47.129
or called the cops, right?

41:48.399 --> 41:49.632
Maybe he can't.

41:54.138 --> 41:55.470
Fire!

41:55.505 --> 41:56.671
Everyone out now.

41:56.706 --> 41:57.672
Leave your stuff.

41:57.707 --> 41:58.907
Come on!

42:01.210 --> 42:02.777
Naz. Come on!

42:02.813 --> 42:04.813
Come on. We'll be fine. Come on.

42:22.998 --> 42:24.832
Stay with me, you'll be okay.

42:35.242 --> 42:36.208
Shut up!

42:36.243 --> 42:37.443
Shut up!
