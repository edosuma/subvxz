She's named after

06:56.900 --> 06:58.250
my favorite beverage color,

06:58.401 --> 07:00.735
but now she's 30 years old,
and she won't talk to me.

07:00.829 --> 07:02.236
(sobbing)

07:02.314 --> 07:04.238
Lisa, do you mind waiting
in the car for a moment?

07:04.258 --> 07:07.408
Daddy needs to be strong
for his famous friend.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.136
Of course.

07:10.431 --> 07:12.989
Can I get a selfie of me
with you in your bathrobe?

07:12.991 --> 07:16.660
Gah, your daughter is so bright
and confident.

07:16.678 --> 07:17.919
She is.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.664
So, you must've taught her
so much.

07:20.682 --> 07:22.348
I guess I did.

07:22.501 --> 07:25.685
You must be the greatest
girl dad i-in the world.

07:25.762 --> 07:27.337

07:27.355 --> 07:29.172

for me, huh?

how to be a better...

07:31.193 --> 07:32.842

07:32.861 --> 07:36.513

you lost your daughter.

That's why I've assembled
this crack team

07:58.795 --> 08:00.461
of daughter dads
to help you out.

08:00.481 --> 08:03.373

I haven't talked to my daughter

08:22.244 --> 08:24.151

08:24.246 --> 08:26.505

a Dead Beet Salad

08:26.673 --> 08:28.356

writes an angry book about you,

08:33.180 --> 08:35.905
don't self-publish
your rebuttal book.

even know where to begin.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.934

you still care.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.253

08:55.184 --> 08:57.610
Call her! Call her! Call her!

08:57.763 --> 08:59.186
I'm on the phone with her now.

08:59.206 --> 09:02.207
GROUP:
Ignore us. Ignore us. Ignore us.

09:02.434 --> 09:04.209
Amber, I was just wondering, um,

09:04.436 --> 09:07.120
could I maybe drive up there
to see you sometime?

09:07.214 --> 09:09.196
Uh, this weekend, maybe?

09:09.216 --> 09:11.608
She said, "I guess."

09:11.626 --> 09:12.884
(others cheer)

09:12.961 --> 09:14.794
No, not... (cheers)

09:14.946 --> 09:16.112

09:16.131 --> 09:17.389

-Hmm.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.998
Well, that's near
the Agatha Christie Museum

09:52.092 --> 09:53.574
of Quirky Detectives.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.743
Lisa likes Agatha Christie?

09:55.762 --> 09:57.320
I love Agatha Christie,

09:57.339 --> 09:59.505
and that museum
is gonna be amazing.

09:59.658 --> 10:02.659
(groans) Ooh! Ah, I can't
believe you remembered.

10:02.661 --> 10:05.328
They're having a special exhibit
this weekend

10:05.421 --> 10:07.939
on her ten reddest herrings.

10:08.166 --> 10:11.109
Thank you.
You're the best dad ever.

10:11.336 --> 10:13.612
Aw, you don't have to thank me.

10:13.763 --> 10:16.531
Do it later in front of Duffman.

10:18.434 --> 10:22.178
Man, I can't believe I'm on
a road trip with my hero.

10:22.197 --> 10:24.347
Wow, your little daughter's
your hero?

10:24.440 --> 10:26.107
That's so sweet.

10:26.184 --> 10:29.035
And that's exactly
who I was referring to.

10:29.187 --> 10:31.704
Oh, hey, we should put on music
that Lisa likes, huh?

10:31.798 --> 10:33.706
Okay, Lisa likes jazz.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.024
That's a thing I know.

10:35.043 --> 10:37.451
Mm, I'm not in the mood
for jazz right now.

10:37.545 --> 10:39.712
Let's listen to
my second favorite.

10:39.865 --> 10:41.789
Salsa? Old-school rap?

10:41.808 --> 10:42.974
Traffic on the twos?

10:43.201 --> 10:44.809
I like K-pop, Dad.

10:44.961 --> 10:47.503
Wh-- Oh, uh, of course.
I knew that.

10:47.505 --> 10:50.798
(laughs) It's fun to pretend
that you're clueless.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.800
(chuckles) Beautiful.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.636
♪<i> We are the lovesick girls</i> ♪

10:55.763 --> 10:57.697
(singing along in Korean)

10:58.900 --> 11:00.049
Oh, yeah!

11:00.068 --> 11:03.411
♪<i> We are the lovesick girls.</i> ♪

11:05.240 --> 11:08.482
Dad, I don't need you
to do that.

11:08.651 --> 11:10.985
(laughs) They always try
to be older

11:11.062 --> 11:12.671
than they are, don't they?

11:12.898 --> 11:14.172
Oh, man, such good fathering.

11:14.323 --> 11:16.416
Not like... Duffman.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.176
(sobbing)

11:18.327 --> 11:20.661
Would it help to talk
about Amber?

11:20.681 --> 11:22.496
(sighs heavily)

11:23.666 --> 11:25.925
She was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

11:26.094 --> 11:28.094
<i> But then I became Duffman,</i>

11:28.246 --> 11:29.595
<i> and, well,</i>
<i> you know what they say,</i>

11:29.748 --> 11:32.916
<i> "With great pilsner</i>

11:32.934 --> 11:35.694
<i> Her mom left me</i>
<i> when Amber was four.</i>

11:37.030 --> 11:38.530
And by the end of high school,
Amber hated me.

11:38.757 --> 11:40.732
Said she never wanted
to talk to me again,

11:40.867 --> 11:42.033
and I guess I just believed her.

11:42.185 --> 11:44.260
Yes, believe women.

11:44.279 --> 11:47.447
No, she was a kid.
She didn't mean it.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.207
Yes, believe Lisa.

11:49.358 --> 11:51.267
I think about her every day,
and I...

11:51.286 --> 11:53.586
I keep this drawing with me
wherever I go.

11:54.940 --> 11:56.773
Aw, you need to tell her
all of this.

11:56.791 --> 12:00.051
I bet she's been waiting for you
to reach out for years.

12:00.278 --> 12:02.779
Oh, Lisa, you are so sweet

12:02.872 --> 12:04.205
and so wise.

12:04.299 --> 12:06.632
Guh-reat job, Homer!

12:06.785 --> 12:08.209
Homer, Homer!

12:08.228 --> 12:10.136
<i> LISA:</i>
<i> Guess what.</i>

12:10.288 --> 12:12.138
They give you
a real tea set to drop

12:12.232 --> 12:15.049
when you walk in the drawing
room and find a dead body.

12:15.143 --> 12:16.550
(phone rings)

12:16.570 --> 12:18.628
Brandon, what is up?

12:18.721 --> 12:19.887
Seriously, like, uh, what's up?

12:19.981 --> 12:21.631
<i> Not your election numbers,</i>
<i> Duff-bro.</i>

12:21.691 --> 12:22.966
<i> They're dismal.</i>

12:22.984 --> 12:25.134
Look, you're near
the corporate mascot convention

12:25.136 --> 12:27.078
at the
Conventions.comventions

12:27.305 --> 12:28.395
convention center.

12:28.490 --> 12:30.823
It'd be a great chance
to drum up some support.

12:30.976 --> 12:32.475
<i> HOMER (over headset):</i>
<i> He'll do it, Brandon.</i>

12:32.568 --> 12:34.978
<i> Duffman cannot lose</i>
<i> this election.</i>

12:34.996 --> 12:36.662
But what about the museum?

12:36.815 --> 12:38.815
There's plenty of time for both.

12:38.833 --> 12:41.134
That's a proud papa pledge.

12:49.694 --> 12:52.662
Hey-ya, Chief,
can I count on you for a...

12:52.755 --> 12:54.272
middle finger, okay.

12:54.423 --> 12:57.333
Ooh, I bet this guy's
a registered Duffocrat.

12:57.426 --> 13:00.111
Uh-oh, he flashed a gun.
My goodness.

13:00.188 --> 13:02.113
Anyone? Anyone want a selfie?

13:02.190 --> 13:04.783
We could use my phone.
I can Air...

13:04.934 --> 13:06.267
Drop it to you.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.786
CONVENTION WORKER:
In five minutes,

13:07.937 --> 13:10.696
join us in Ballroom C
for a panel discussion.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.606
The Charlie Tuna Conundrum--

13:12.700 --> 13:15.084
When the Mascot Is the Product.

13:19.357 --> 13:21.024
Attention, everyone,

13:21.117 --> 13:24.193
Duffman is sitting
all by himself in Hallway B.

13:24.212 --> 13:25.878
Please just go say hi to him.

13:26.031 --> 13:28.214
He really needs this. And, uh,

13:28.366 --> 13:29.882
don't listen to this
if you're him.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.535
(laughs) Oh, my God.

13:32.554 --> 13:34.871
Can I get your autograph...
pen?

13:35.040 --> 13:37.649
I got to get a signature
from the Mucinex loogie.

13:37.876 --> 13:40.401
He is so hot. (laughs)

13:41.637 --> 13:43.896
Losing to a loogie.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.657
(sighs)

13:45.808 --> 13:47.141
Dad, shouldn't we get going?

13:47.235 --> 13:49.052
The museum closes at 5:00.

13:49.145 --> 13:51.812
Don't worry, sweetie,
I'm keeping an eye on the time.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.331
It's only 2:30.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.484
(screams)
That's not a real clock!

13:57.504 --> 14:01.130
That's the mascot
for Tea Time Tamales. (gasps)

14:02.083 --> 14:04.342
Oh, my God, no.

14:06.738 --> 14:08.996
LISA:
Wait! Wait!

14:09.165 --> 14:10.740
No, don't close!

14:10.758 --> 14:12.241
You can't close yet.

14:12.260 --> 14:14.853
Mm, sorry, kid, we're shutting
down for three months

14:15.080 --> 14:16.596
to build a new attraction.

14:16.748 --> 14:18.414
LISA:
Aw, nuts.

14:18.433 --> 14:21.359
You got to stay open.
We drove all this way,

14:21.510 --> 14:23.603
and I'm a second grader
who solves murders

14:23.697 --> 14:25.179
on a sixth-grade level.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.513
Well, look who I brought.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.683
I can unlock a lot of things
for Duffman,

14:29.703 --> 14:31.494
but not this museum.

14:35.934 --> 14:39.210
(growls, screams)

14:39.362 --> 14:41.880
Well, this calls
for some expert dadding.

14:42.031 --> 14:44.107
Lisa, honey,
tell Daddy what's wrong.

14:44.200 --> 14:45.791
This is all your fault.

14:45.944 --> 14:47.610
That's right.

14:47.629 --> 14:49.795
-Let it out.
-Okay,

14:49.948 --> 14:51.222
I am tired of you pretending

14:51.374 --> 14:54.058
that you're some sort of
ideal dad when this whole trip

14:54.285 --> 14:57.620
you've been kissing
Duffman's cans.

14:57.713 --> 14:59.956
See, I knew you
wouldn't have any fun.

15:00.049 --> 15:02.266
That's why I didn't think
you should come. Eh...

15:02.493 --> 15:03.401
Uh-oh.

15:03.628 --> 15:06.796
(gasps) You didn't even want
to bring me.

15:06.814 --> 15:08.239
You were just using me

15:08.466 --> 15:11.300
as some kind of girl-dad prop,

15:11.319 --> 15:13.469
just like Duffman did.

15:13.488 --> 15:14.987
Don't ever

15:15.081 --> 15:16.656
talk to me

15:16.808 --> 15:18.124
again.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.738
She'll get over this, right?

15:24.832 --> 15:26.591
Mine did not.

15:26.742 --> 15:29.302
Oh...

15:30.597 --> 15:31.745
Ready, handsome?

15:31.765 --> 15:33.598
-You're leaving?
-(grunts)

15:33.749 --> 15:36.100
Duffman just realized that you

15:36.327 --> 15:39.586
are not a good dad. Uh-uh.

15:39.681 --> 15:42.848
I'm all yours... Renata.

15:43.001 --> 15:43.924
Fun name.

15:44.018 --> 15:45.485
(rolling R):
Renata.

15:47.021 --> 15:48.279
Oh...

15:54.287 --> 15:55.769
So...

15:55.789 --> 15:57.372
what you reading there?

15:59.316 --> 16:01.350
Come on,
you got to say something.

16:01.519 --> 16:02.943
Something.

16:02.963 --> 16:05.446
Ooh, I can't handle
the silent treatment.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.206
Don't leave me alone
with my brain.

16:07.358 --> 16:09.634
-I remember this one time...
-Eyes on the road!

16:09.861 --> 16:11.094
-(gasps)
-(tires screech)

16:12.639 --> 16:16.215
Oh, Duffman left Amber's drawing
in the car.

16:16.367 --> 16:17.791
It's really a shame about them.

16:17.811 --> 16:20.478
It is. (sighs) He really does
love her, you know.

16:20.705 --> 16:23.314
Maybe, but Duffman should've
spent more time listening

16:23.466 --> 16:27.043
to Amber instead of thinking
only about himself.

16:27.061 --> 16:29.378
Well, maybe sometimes
Duffman's scared to listen

16:29.397 --> 16:32.657
because he'll hear about all
the dumb stuff he screwed up.

16:32.884 --> 16:34.975
Sure, but maybe
he should be brave enough

16:34.995 --> 16:36.977
to admit he's not perfect.

16:36.997 --> 16:39.889
Not even close to perfect.

16:39.982 --> 16:41.482
(groans) Oh...

16:41.501 --> 16:43.650
I think we should
take this to them.

16:43.745 --> 16:47.505
Yeah. I hope they work
things out before it's too late.

16:47.732 --> 16:50.842
Me, too, Dad.
That would be really great.

16:51.069 --> 16:53.261
(tires screech)

16:56.241 --> 16:58.165
Good luck, buddy.
I'm rooting for you.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.167
Thank you, Evan, and good luck

17:00.245 --> 17:02.395
with your MFA. Oh, yeah.

17:08.344 --> 17:10.695
Okay, here we go.
Time to prove to your daughter

17:10.846 --> 17:12.421
that you've changed.

17:12.440 --> 17:13.439
Ah. Damn.

17:13.591 --> 17:14.699
MAN:
A little help, bro?

17:14.850 --> 17:16.868
Dude, it's Duffman.

17:17.019 --> 17:18.703
Join our rager!

17:18.854 --> 17:20.429
Oh, yeah.

17:20.448 --> 17:23.041
I mean, no, no.
Not who I am anymore.

17:24.026 --> 17:25.785
(inhales, exhales)

17:25.937 --> 17:27.937
-(knock on door)
-Okay. (sighs)

17:28.030 --> 17:29.789
(breathes deeply)

17:29.941 --> 17:32.032
I can't believe you're here

17:32.126 --> 17:34.293
because I don't know you,
and I did not invite you.

17:34.445 --> 17:36.888
Oh, what an odd thing to say.

17:37.039 --> 17:39.282
Hi, I'm Homer, and this is Lisa.

17:39.375 --> 17:41.133
We have something
to give to your dad.

17:41.286 --> 17:43.043
Yeah, well, I can't help you.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.637
(sighs) He never showed.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.214
(gasps) I don't get it.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.475
If I know Duffman,
and I briefly did,

17:49.627 --> 17:52.386
nothing was more important
to him than seeing you.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.813
He was so excited.

17:53.948 --> 17:57.483
Really? As excited as he was
to miss every dance recital,

17:57.635 --> 18:00.653
every graduation,
every art show?

18:00.805 --> 18:02.471
No. More.

18:02.490 --> 18:04.248
Your dad taught me
the importance

18:04.400 --> 18:06.826
of not taking my daughter's
love for granted.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.586
Duffman's really changed.

18:08.737 --> 18:10.313
Trust me, when you see him next,

18:10.373 --> 18:12.739
you'll be amazed
at how enlightened

18:12.834 --> 18:15.075
and sensitive he's become.

18:15.095 --> 18:17.320
DUFFMAN:
Chicken fight!

18:17.322 --> 18:18.930
♪<i> Doo, bow, bow...</i> ♪

18:19.081 --> 18:20.747
Come on, friend!

18:20.916 --> 18:23.250
-(laughs)
-What the crap?

18:23.269 --> 18:25.419
No, Amber, I was just about
to knock on your door.

18:25.513 --> 18:26.512
You have to believe me.

18:26.664 --> 18:28.998
It's true.
This whole chicken fight,

18:29.016 --> 18:30.608
it felt like
he was somewhere else.

18:30.835 --> 18:33.778
I'm sorry, Colleen, but if this
teaches you anything,

18:33.929 --> 18:36.948
it's that you should work on
your relationship with your dad.

18:37.175 --> 18:39.692
(scoffs) I have a great
relationship with my dad.

18:39.844 --> 18:42.695
I just also like bikinis
and parties, you jerk.

18:42.771 --> 18:44.288
Duffman respects your journey.

18:44.440 --> 18:46.374
Amber? Amber!

18:47.852 --> 18:49.518
Amber!

18:49.612 --> 18:50.795
Ah, Amber...

18:50.964 --> 18:53.113
Hey, uh, pal--
Whoa, that's Duffman!

18:53.133 --> 18:55.616
Amber, look out!

18:55.710 --> 18:57.552
(gasps)

19:01.549 --> 19:03.474
You saved me...

19:03.667 --> 19:05.226
Dad.

19:08.464 --> 19:10.982
So, the chick magnet
is also a daughter magnet,

19:11.133 --> 19:12.483
I get it now.

19:12.635 --> 19:15.302
All chicks
are somebody's daughter.

19:15.396 --> 19:18.230
-No. Uh-uh.
-Yeah, try again.

19:18.383 --> 19:20.658
Some chicks are guys,
and that's okay.

19:20.809 --> 19:22.067
Mm... Mm-mm.

19:22.162 --> 19:24.053
-Hmm.
-It-It's okay, Dad.

19:24.222 --> 19:26.238
B-Baby steps, I guess.

19:26.391 --> 19:29.158
(loud whisper):
Give her this now.

19:30.152 --> 19:32.336
No way. I haven't
seen this in ages.

19:32.413 --> 19:34.246
I look at it every single day.

19:34.399 --> 19:37.991
I miss you so much, and
I should've been there for you.

19:38.011 --> 19:41.012
(scoffs) Dad, I'm so glad
you're back in my life,

19:41.163 --> 19:43.088
-and I really hope that...
-(phone rings)

19:43.165 --> 19:44.831
Ugh, seriously?

19:44.926 --> 19:46.742
<i> Duffman, amazing news.</i>

19:46.761 --> 19:48.853
-You won the election.
-Oh, yeah?

19:49.004 --> 19:50.170
Oh, yeah.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.097
Some kid posted video
of you singing K-pop,

19:52.192 --> 19:54.917
and their fan army voted
for you en freakin' masse.

19:54.919 --> 19:56.419
I need you on
the next plane to Korea.

19:56.437 --> 19:59.438
Kim Jong-un wants to kidnap you
and make a movie together.

19:59.590 --> 20:00.940
Oh, yeah!

20:01.092 --> 20:02.533
(Amber groans)

20:03.686 --> 20:05.945
Aw, you know what?
I think I have had enough

20:06.097 --> 20:07.521
of that wonderful Duff.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.449
What? You'll never work in
the adult beverage game again.

Duff Nation, Duffman is here

20:17.442 --> 20:20.276
to get you wrecked
in a whole new way as...

20:20.369 --> 20:22.611
Puffman.

20:22.705 --> 20:25.281
Come check out my daughter's
brand-new weed store

20:25.374 --> 20:27.708
featuring her custom-made,
one of a kind,

20:27.727 --> 20:29.393
glass bongs.

20:29.620 --> 20:30.728
(inhales)

20:30.955 --> 20:33.789
Oh, yeah. If any of my other
estranged daughters

20:33.808 --> 20:35.716
are watching, hit me up.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.309
Wait, your what?
