-BRUCE: <i>Job's yours.</i>

00:06.924 --> 00:08.467
When we first started talking
about Washington,

00:08.550 --> 00:10.385
I reached out to the National Gallery.

00:10.469 --> 00:12.387
They just called me
and offered me a position.

00:12.638 --> 00:14.932
I made a call to Bruce in Washington.

00:15.015 --> 00:18.018
He's meeting with the FBI Director
to put your release in motion.

00:18.810 --> 00:19.895

Her real name is Rachel Turner, MI5.

because you're such a big asset.

The bureau doesn't want to lose you.

00:47.464 --> 00:48.674
ELIZABETH: Now you
don't want to go to DC.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.217
It's all bureaucracy, El.

00:50.342 --> 00:51.635
I'll commute back and forth.

00:51.718 --> 00:52.761

Stay right where you are, Mozzie.

01:55.324 --> 01:57.659
Okay, look, I can explain, Suit.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.996
I'm so very lonely.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.674
You're going to tell me where he is.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.843
I know all your
interrogation techniques, Suit.

02:14.927 --> 02:16.637
I'm never gonna crack.

02:17.638 --> 02:21.225
I'm also aided by the fact that
I have no idea what you're talking about.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.936
We both know Neal ran.

02:24.019 --> 02:25.812
Of course we do.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.774
Now, where exactly do we know he ran to?

02:31.068 --> 02:32.819
That's what you're gonna tell me.

02:33.237 --> 02:36.698
The answer, dear Suit,
is that he didn't run.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.325
And the evidence
is right in front of you.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.409

Thanks, Jones.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.419
Ergo?

02:50.712 --> 02:54.591
At 12:52 p.m., Neal cut his anklet.
He's gone.

-You're gonna tell me where he went.
-Whoa, whoa.

-That's right.

That's impossible,

We were talking about...

03:08.522 --> 03:11.108
I bet you were. I saw the body double.

03:12.025 --> 03:15.445
The FBI betrayed him.
What else would you expect?

03:15.529 --> 03:16.864
You're not helping your case.

We wouldn't do it like this.

10:51.735 --> 10:54.821
She got a job in Washington

but then I decided to stay.

Neal. He was supposed to get
a deal for his freedom,

11:02.079 --> 11:04.081
it fell through, I stayed.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.505
I chose to do what's right.

11:14.967 --> 11:16.927

to scout a location and prep for a heist.

and you failed.

12:51.104 --> 12:54.107
I meant what I said earlier.
I need to leave town.

12:54.191 --> 12:56.777
If Rebecca contacted you,
it means you can provide a way out.

12:56.860 --> 12:57.861
I can.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.446
Then this is a simple
business arrangement,

12:59.530 --> 13:01.490
I help you, you help me.

13:03.825 --> 13:05.744
All right, how about a gesture of faith?

13:06.119 --> 13:08.247
(SCOFFS)
It'd have to be a hell of a gesture.

13:08.330 --> 13:11.333
Any minute now,
the FBI is gonna storm into this building.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.001
We need to be out of here before they do.

13:13.085 --> 13:14.127
They'll never find this place.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.963
Yeah, you did a great job
of getting off the grid,

13:16.046 --> 13:19.049
but Peter Burke is leading
the investigation. He'll find me.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.884
We're lucky he isn't already here.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.678
Look, if I wanted to go back to that life,

13:22.761 --> 13:25.180
I'd stall,
bide my time with promises and lies

13:25.264 --> 13:26.723
until Burke breaks down that door.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.392
But I don't want to go back.

13:29.226 --> 13:32.729
Your options are prison, death
or trusting me. What's it gonna be?

(SIRENS WAILING)

13:59.131 --> 14:00.174
Partners?

14:20.027 --> 14:21.904
PETER: Someone was just here.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.616
Not of their own free will.

14:25.699 --> 14:28.368
Rebecca said she made contact
with a man named Booth.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.287
Jones is running a background on him now.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.455
Do you think he wanted the diamond?

14:31.538 --> 14:34.499
If it was him, I'd guess so.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.460
Hey, hey. I'm with the band.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.086
It's all right, let him in.

14:38.170 --> 14:39.546
See? I told you.

14:39.796 --> 14:41.089
Vindication.

14:41.173 --> 14:42.674
If you'd listened to me sooner, Suit...

14:42.758 --> 14:45.511
There's no evidence yet, we're running
some tests to see if Neal was here.

14:45.594 --> 14:48.805
If his captor was any good,
he'd have wiped everything down.

14:49.223 --> 14:50.474
Maybe not everything.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.059
What do you see?

14:55.187 --> 14:56.396
Wood shavings.

14:57.231 --> 14:59.191
Why would there be wood shavings?

15:03.070 --> 15:05.405
He didn't make them
trying to set himself free.

15:07.241 --> 15:08.867
Neal knew you'd find this place.

15:16.291 --> 15:17.292
Kessman.

15:18.168 --> 15:19.878
Kessman Building, downtown.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.505
That could be where they took Neal.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.674
MOZZIE: It's not the kind of place
you take a captive.

15:25.133 --> 15:26.718
It's the kind of place you rob.

15:33.559 --> 15:34.935
DIANA: The Kessman Building.

15:35.060 --> 15:38.397
The offices are owned by a "who's who"
of the overly rich and powerful.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.274
Why would Neal lead us there?

15:40.357 --> 15:42.818
-Jones, what do we have on the suspect?
-Mmm.

15:43.819 --> 15:45.654
JONES: Jim Booth, he's a thief for hire.

15:45.737 --> 15:47.865
Couple of high profile
smash and grabs in Europe,

15:47.948 --> 15:51.410
a ruby heist from the Burj Khalifa
in Dubai, usually works alone.

15:52.369 --> 15:54.329
So, we have a thief
not known for kidnapping

15:54.413 --> 15:57.916
and a building
that's more target than safe house.

15:58.584 --> 16:00.085
What am I missing here?

16:03.922 --> 16:06.216
This is usually where Neal says something.

16:06.842 --> 16:08.302
Look where that's gotten him.

16:13.557 --> 16:16.435
Neal knows where he's headed.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.770
Not typical of a captive.

16:19.062 --> 16:21.023
What, you think they're working together?

16:21.106 --> 16:25.068
I'm saying he may have adapted
to the situation at hand.

16:26.153 --> 16:28.071
So, Booth wants a treasure he can't get,

16:28.155 --> 16:30.449
Neal redirects him to something he can.

16:31.283 --> 16:33.285
Who in this building
would have that something?

16:33.368 --> 16:34.620
DIANA: It's target-rich.

16:34.703 --> 16:37.247
There are over 60 tenants in the building,
it could be any one of them.

16:37.372 --> 16:38.373
Yeah.

16:38.707 --> 16:41.376
All right, if we can't
narrow it down to who,

16:41.460 --> 16:43.545
let's figure out how he's getting in.

16:43.629 --> 16:44.671
How would you break in?

16:44.755 --> 16:47.174
Nice try. I know a trap when I see one.

16:47.257 --> 16:48.258
Mozzie, it's not a trap.

16:48.342 --> 16:52.471
I tell you how I do it, then you arrest me
for intent to commit a crime.

16:52.554 --> 16:55.474
Aren't you a lawyer? You do know
that isn't how it works, right?

16:57.100 --> 16:58.810
What's the security like?

16:58.894 --> 17:01.355
It's top notch.
Guards at all entrance points,

17:01.438 --> 17:04.566
thermal ID and corneal scanners
to activate the elevators.

17:04.650 --> 17:06.735
For this to work,
Woodford can't know you're going in,

17:06.818 --> 17:08.654
that means we can't con our way up.

17:08.946 --> 17:10.447
If the lobby is impregnable...

17:10.531 --> 17:12.407
That means I'd go in through the roof.

17:12.491 --> 17:14.576
Yeah, but you'd still need
to get past the elevators.

17:14.660 --> 17:17.454
Security is focused on keeping
people from getting up,

17:17.538 --> 17:19.081
but elevators have to go down.

17:19.164 --> 17:20.832
Fire code is a thief's best friend.

17:20.958 --> 17:22.459
So, we wait for night and make our move.

17:22.543 --> 17:23.836
No. Day.

17:23.919 --> 17:25.170
When everyone can see us?

17:25.254 --> 17:27.589
Well, at night security's on high alert.

17:27.673 --> 17:29.383
During the day
they won't be patrolling the offices,

17:29.466 --> 17:31.301
the motion sensors will be off.

17:31.385 --> 17:33.011
So, how do we get to the roof?

17:33.178 --> 17:34.763
Pull a man on wire.

17:34.847 --> 17:37.057
In 1974, Philippe Petit

17:37.140 --> 17:41.103
used a bow and arrow to shoot a cable
between the World Trade Center towers,

17:41.186 --> 17:43.564
then he tightrope-walked across it.

17:43.647 --> 17:46.942
But today's security has a man
on every rooftop, we'd never make it.

17:47.025 --> 17:48.068
So, then what?

17:48.360 --> 17:50.445
I'd need a faster option.

17:52.197 --> 17:53.907
Bring up the image of the building.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.076
Please.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.455
Can you zoom into the left image?

18:02.541 --> 18:04.209
Ah! Bingo.

18:04.710 --> 18:07.087
Shoot an arrow from that building
past the Kessman

18:07.171 --> 18:09.006
to the building on the other side.

18:09.548 --> 18:12.134
Then it's just a simple zip line down,
drop onto the roof and I'm in?

18:12.217 --> 18:13.260
That's right.

18:13.343 --> 18:15.888
And I'll keep an eye on the rooftop guard
from the second building.

18:15.971 --> 18:18.432
One problem. I don't have
the equipment for something like that.

18:18.515 --> 18:19.725
I know just the guy.

18:19.808 --> 18:20.934
What's his name?

18:21.018 --> 18:22.311
I can't tell you that.

18:22.603 --> 18:23.604
Why not?

18:24.188 --> 18:26.857
Neal told us to go
to the Kessman Building,

18:26.940 --> 18:29.067
not to rat out a trusted ally.

18:29.151 --> 18:31.486
Mozzie, right now
we're following breadcrumbs, all right?

18:31.570 --> 18:33.989
We need to get ahead of this
so we know what we're dealing with.

18:34.072 --> 18:36.200
Neal led us to the building.
He has a plan.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.410
And I don't work by Neal's plans.

18:38.493 --> 18:41.580
-Suit...
-No, Mozzie, no more excuses.

18:42.289 --> 18:45.459
If you want me to keep Neal alive,
you're gonna give me that name.

18:48.670 --> 18:49.963
Fat Charlie.

18:51.423 --> 18:53.133
His name is Fat Charlie.

18:53.509 --> 18:55.177
And you're gonna take me to him.

19:01.391 --> 19:03.060
MOZZIE: I get it now.
PETER: What's that?

19:03.143 --> 19:05.187
Why Neal likes working with you.

19:05.270 --> 19:08.357
With every new case he gets to think of
how he would commit the crime.

19:08.440 --> 19:11.527
He gets the thrill of invention
without the threat of jail time.

19:11.652 --> 19:13.487
Hmm, maybe I'll put an anklet on you next.

19:13.570 --> 19:15.364
I would gnaw my leg off.

19:15.447 --> 19:17.199
Oh, listen.

19:17.282 --> 19:19.868
Fat Charlie is kind of
a tricky guy to deal with,

19:19.952 --> 19:22.371
so you should really
let me take the lead, okay?

19:22.454 --> 19:23.747
By all means.

don't tell a single person,

19:53.527 --> 19:55.195
and I'll forget I ever saw this place.

Go.

to protect your relationships.

come looking for him?

20:17.467 --> 20:19.344
Booth, I'd like you to meet

20:22.222 --> 20:23.599
an old friend of mine.

20:25.309 --> 20:26.560
Hello, Neal.

20:33.734 --> 20:35.194

20:42.075 --> 20:43.911
Someone new I'm working with.

20:44.036 --> 20:45.204
It's good to see you.

20:45.704 --> 20:47.247
You know I'm always here for you.

20:53.795 --> 20:55.255
How can I help?

21:11.605 --> 21:12.773
What's happening now?

21:13.982 --> 21:16.860
Peter's giving Neal an opportunity
to pass a message.

21:17.110 --> 21:18.362
If Booth has backup, a hidden gun,

21:18.445 --> 21:20.364
anything we need to know
before we move in.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.950
Neal has a plan, we're interrupting it.

21:23.242 --> 21:25.452
What if he doesn't want Peter moving in?

21:25.536 --> 21:27.287
He'd need a damn good reason not to.

21:27.371 --> 21:28.872
Oh, you care to make a wager on it?

21:28.956 --> 21:30.249
-What?
-If I'm right,

21:30.332 --> 21:32.584
and Peter lets Neal
continue with this plan,

I get to ask you a single question
that you must answer honestly.

you never set foot in this van again.

22:26.263 --> 22:28.140
That's exactly why we need it.

22:30.309 --> 22:31.602
It's worth the risk.

22:34.646 --> 22:36.190
I'll get what you need.

22:38.692 --> 22:41.403
(SIGHS) All right, you win.

22:41.528 --> 22:42.696
So, what's the question?

22:42.779 --> 22:43.906
Oh, that's the trick of it.

22:44.323 --> 22:47.826
I didn't specify when I was going to ask.

22:51.079 --> 22:54.583
Pink Panthers, the most dangerous
gang of thieves in the world.

22:55.083 --> 22:59.505
Over the past 20 years, they've stolen
a total of $1.2 billion worth

22:59.588 --> 23:02.799
of diamonds, gems and other valuables.

23:03.967 --> 23:07.304
No law enforcement agency
has ever come close to catching them.

23:07.930 --> 23:09.473
This is Alan Woodford,

23:10.098 --> 23:12.142
long suspected
to be the leader of the group.

23:12.226 --> 23:15.729
He's also an owner of an office
at the Kessman Building.

23:16.438 --> 23:18.565
I think Neal plans to infiltrate the gang.

23:18.649 --> 23:19.650
By robbing them.

23:20.442 --> 23:23.487
Intel says that the Panthers
have an audition process.

23:23.570 --> 23:25.155
It would make quite an audition.

23:25.322 --> 23:26.990
Hell of a way to get yourself killed too.

23:27.074 --> 23:29.701
It's not without its dangers,

23:29.785 --> 23:33.080
but Neal could've walked away
from Fat Charlie's. He didn't.

23:33.288 --> 23:35.332
Can I say
what we're all probably thinking?

23:35.415 --> 23:39.336
I mean, are we sure Neal's not auditioning
to join the group for real?

23:39.419 --> 23:41.713
Mozzie as much as admitted
they were planning to run.

23:41.797 --> 23:43.799
The FBI reneged on a deal with him.

23:43.966 --> 23:46.301
I hate to say it, but he's pretty
motivated to turn against us.

23:46.510 --> 23:47.845
It's a risk, I know.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.055
But for now, we trust Neal.

23:50.430 --> 23:51.598
That's it.

23:51.682 --> 23:54.101
Go home, get some rest.
Big day tomorrow.

24:02.985 --> 24:04.987
Standard ID photo is ready.

24:06.697 --> 24:08.240
I'm watching the roof.

24:08.448 --> 24:10.617
There's a single guard
with an electronic check point.

24:10.701 --> 24:12.870
He needs to tap in every five minutes
or an alarm sounds.

24:13.453 --> 24:15.247
That gives us a small window.

24:15.330 --> 24:16.832
Smile.

24:20.586 --> 24:22.504
Why do you wanna join the Panthers?

24:22.588 --> 24:25.257
You said it, they're the greatest thieves
of our time.

24:25.340 --> 24:28.177
But you've worked with Rebecca before,
it means you're good.

24:28.302 --> 24:29.595
You don't need them.

24:29.678 --> 24:32.222
No one in the Panthers needs anyone,
that's the beauty of it.

24:32.306 --> 24:35.601
I looked at each one of them and I knew
they were capable of almost anything,

24:35.684 --> 24:38.478
but if we could all work together,

24:39.229 --> 24:41.148
we could get the kind of score

they'll know I was there.

We could figure out a disguise,
something to pass the facial scanners.

41:08.594 --> 41:10.179
-We're pregnant.
-Yeah.

41:10.262 --> 41:11.263
(BOTH LAUGHING)

41:12.806 --> 41:14.183
She made a choice.

41:15.267 --> 41:19.146
For her, it was better to risk
almost certain death than go back to jail.

41:19.771 --> 41:21.857
Some birds can't be caged.

41:22.774 --> 41:25.110
I doubt I'd be that brave
if the time came.

41:27.863 --> 41:28.947
Was that bravery?

41:31.992 --> 41:33.744
There's always another way.

41:33.827 --> 41:35.495
I've lived my life on the idea.

41:36.955 --> 41:38.665
That's what we tell ourselves.

41:39.791 --> 41:43.295
The greatest lies a conman tells
are to himself.

41:43.462 --> 41:47.716
But if we are being honest, she's right.

41:48.217 --> 41:49.635
We're on borrowed time.

41:50.552 --> 41:53.722
Our sins catch up to us all eventually.

41:53.805 --> 41:55.015
Maybe not.

41:57.809 --> 41:59.603
I offered Peter a deal.

42:00.729 --> 42:02.689
The Pink Panthers for my freedom.

42:06.151 --> 42:10.197
While you were kidnapped,
I walked in your shoes.

42:11.156 --> 42:14.826
I sat in the FBI, felt the camaraderie.

42:16.161 --> 42:17.579
It's compelling.

42:20.165 --> 42:21.875
It's also an illusion.

42:22.167 --> 42:25.170
We are who we are, as are they.

42:25.712 --> 42:27.422
They promised you freedom before,

42:27.506 --> 42:29.508
what makes you think
this time they'll deliver?

42:32.553 --> 42:34.555
Who says that's all I'm after?
