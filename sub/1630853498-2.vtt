WEBVTT

01:52.000 --> 01:53.200
Oi!

01:55.040 --> 01:56.320
What was that?

01:56.400 --> 01:58.360
That was you almost
taking my head off.

01:58.440 --> 02:00.280
Go swim between
the flags tourist,

02:00.360 --> 02:02.560
or next time
I'll run you over.

02:05.240 --> 02:07.680
I thought surfers
are meant to be chill?

02:21.640 --> 02:23.280
Hey!

02:23.360 --> 02:24.760
Was that yours?

02:24.840 --> 02:26.080
So sorry.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.280
It's finals day
at the Shorehaven Pro Juniors,

02:46.360 --> 02:48.040
and things are heating up.

02:48.120 --> 02:50.360
Five minutes left
in this quarter final

02:50.440 --> 02:52.400
and it's been the local
boys Gibson and Sousa

02:52.480 --> 02:54.040
right from the start.

02:54.120 --> 02:57.040
The other two
competitors just outgunned.

02:57.120 --> 02:58.880
Gibson started strong but
Sousa's had him

02:58.960 --> 03:00.680
in a tractor beam
all day.

03:00.760 --> 03:03.360
Gibson just can't
find space out there.

03:06.760 --> 03:08.800
Gibson likes
the look of this one...

03:11.320 --> 03:13.560
...but again, Sousa,
right on his tail.

03:13.640 --> 03:15.120
Really?! Come on!

03:15.200 --> 03:16.880
Bit of a
wobble there for Gibson.

03:23.840 --> 03:27.240
And boom!
Executes a pop shuvit.

03:32.400 --> 03:33.480
Yo.

03:33.560 --> 03:36.120
Oh, hey. Sorry I've got
a heat coming up.

03:36.200 --> 03:39.040
Right. Just checking,
do you think your brother's

03:39.120 --> 03:40.480
too busy for that
ride to the airport?

03:40.560 --> 03:43.960
I don't know,
Manu's pretty flat out, but...

03:44.040 --> 03:47.360
...Prawnie, can you drop
Summer to the airport later?

03:48.360 --> 03:50.400
Yeah. As long as
she's into Baker Boy

03:50.480 --> 03:52.120
and she's ready to go by three.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.440
Okay done.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.360
Cool. Thanks.

03:55.440 --> 03:56.520
Everything okay?

03:56.600 --> 03:57.960
Yeah, once
I get on that plane,

03:58.040 --> 03:59.240
everything will be fine.

04:01.920 --> 04:03.240
Oi!

04:03.320 --> 04:04.320
I didn't touch you man.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.440
Oh sure. It must've been a
passing dolphin or something.

04:06.520 --> 04:07.680
What are
you complaining about?

04:07.760 --> 04:08.640
You got through.

04:13.560 --> 04:14.720
You really want
to do this, Gibson?

04:22.720 --> 04:23.680
You know what?
Whatever.

04:23.760 --> 04:25.720
I'm not fighting you.
You're injured.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.520
Is this a mystical surf
ritual I don't know about

04:34.600 --> 04:35.640
or a stupid boy fight?

04:37.400 --> 04:38.880
Stupid boy fight.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.200
I don't have
time for this. Manu!

04:43.280 --> 04:45.160
You guys stop,
this is really unhealthy.

04:46.440 --> 04:47.800
Hey! Hey!
Fight back!

04:47.880 --> 04:49.800
Get up! Get up!

04:49.880 --> 04:51.000
Look, if you want
to get disqualified,

04:51.080 --> 04:52.520
you keep doing what
you're doing, all right?

04:52.600 --> 04:54.240
What's going on here guys?

04:54.320 --> 04:56.600
Sorry, we were
just goofing around.

04:56.680 --> 04:57.440
Yeah

04:57.520 --> 04:59.560
Well, let's keep it
chill from now on eh?

04:59.640 --> 05:01.200
No worries, hey,
thank you mate.

05:02.200 --> 05:04.160
Um, I was thinking we
could hit the rock pools?

05:04.240 --> 05:05.320
Might help get you grounded.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.160
I don't need
to get grounded,

05:07.240 --> 05:08.320
I need to eat though.

05:10.960 --> 05:12.360
Get up here.

05:12.440 --> 05:14.600
See this is why you
compete with your friends,

05:14.680 --> 05:16.760
and not against them, yeah?

05:16.840 --> 05:18.600
We're not really
friends anymore.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.680
Okay. Fair enough.

05:21.760 --> 05:24.280
But why are you sabotaging your
chances of state selection?

05:24.360 --> 05:25.720
You know this counts, right?

05:26.760 --> 05:29.200
Mate, look,
I don't know if you've heard,

05:29.280 --> 05:31.920
but I'm running Shorehaven
Boardriders now.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.320
Coaching the groms, Marlon,
Bodhi, your little sis.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.840
Now if you want to
get serious about it,

05:37.920 --> 05:39.440
I want to get you
involved, okay?

05:42.160 --> 05:44.920
Look, it's a solo sport brother,

05:45.000 --> 05:47.880
but it's a lonely road
without a crew. Trust me.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.040
That was
pretty pathetic!

05:55.120 --> 05:56.840
Right?
Even worse than his surf.

06:02.720 --> 06:05.200
Yo! Remember me?

06:06.320 --> 06:07.480
You owe me a new skateboard.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.160
If you're going to leave
it lying in a carpark,

06:09.240 --> 06:10.600
it's not my fault
it gets busted.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.520
I think $200 should cover it.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.080
Oh, and that's U.S. by the way.

06:14.160 --> 06:15.480
How about a couple
of onion rings?

06:15.560 --> 06:17.280
Sheridan! Hey.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.400
Can I talk to you about
something real quick?

06:19.480 --> 06:21.240
Is she
a friend of yours?

06:21.320 --> 06:22.880
Yeah, it's recent.

06:22.960 --> 06:24.880
Hey Pops, nice
job making the quarters.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.720
Just 'cause you didn't make
many finals last year.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.320
Thanks for the support, Griff.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.400
Come on. Let's go.

06:32.120 --> 06:33.280
Who are they?

06:33.360 --> 06:34.520
Anchor Cove Boardriders.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.920
They've all got massive tickets
on themselves. Just ignore them.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.120
Are you kidding?
We needs to get payback.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.880
I'll get payback in the water.

06:46.360 --> 06:48.280
Still here, America?

07:04.280 --> 07:05.960
Early days
in this quarter final

07:06.040 --> 07:06.800
and it's neck and neck,

07:06.880 --> 07:11.440
Shorehaven's Poppy Tetanui
and Anchor Cove's Lily Tran.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.440
Tetanui might be
too late to catch this one.

07:18.040 --> 07:20.800
No! Hold up,
she's all over it.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.000
Tran, of course,
from the formidable

07:33.080 --> 07:34.680
Anchor Cove Boardrider's Club,

07:34.760 --> 07:37.120
and that place is just
a champion factory.

07:39.480 --> 07:40.920
But Tetanui
isn't giving up,

07:41.000 --> 07:42.920
she's going
buckets out there.

07:52.760 --> 07:55.880
Tetanui's looking
so powerful on her home break.

07:55.960 --> 07:57.840
That should be enough
to seal the win.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.240
Whoo! Smoking Poppy!

07:59.320 --> 08:00.560
Will you keep it down?

08:02.560 --> 08:04.160
I'm thinking we'll
just break one of her boards.

08:04.240 --> 08:06.360
Dude, how about
instead of revenge,

08:06.440 --> 08:07.680
I take you for a ride
on my jet ski?

08:07.760 --> 08:11.000
I mean, unless you hate
going fast and having fun.

08:11.080 --> 08:12.560
Don't you have a girlfriend?

08:12.640 --> 08:14.120
Yeah. So?

08:16.560 --> 08:18.840
Okay, wish me luck.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.960
Hey Manu,
how are you mate?

08:23.040 --> 08:24.400
Yeah not bad Thommo.
What's up?

08:24.480 --> 08:26.600
Manu,
have you seen our American?

08:26.680 --> 08:27.800
She's gone AWOL.

08:27.880 --> 08:29.600
Uh, no I haven't, sorry.

08:29.680 --> 08:31.880
-See you in a bit.
-Okay, thanks anyway.

08:31.960 --> 08:33.520
So where's that jet ski at?

08:51.400 --> 08:52.520
Sorry, I'll just be a second.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.560
No, no, no, no.
Take your time.

08:55.560 --> 08:57.320
You got to build
the brand, right?

08:58.640 --> 09:01.280
And hey, your posts
are really well-written.

09:01.360 --> 09:03.160
Oh, thanks.

09:03.240 --> 09:06.320
I mean like I read
a couple of them recently.

09:07.640 --> 09:09.400
But hey, when's your semi-final?

09:09.480 --> 09:10.560
Um, not 'til later,

09:10.640 --> 09:13.080
but it's better to give
Poppy space on comp days.

09:13.160 --> 09:15.560
Once the headphones go on,
she's not to be disturbed.

09:15.640 --> 09:18.360
No, it definitely feels like
everything's gone up a notch.

09:19.520 --> 09:22.640
Try to get away when I can.
Find some Zen, you know?

09:22.720 --> 09:24.960
You should try it next time
you feel like punching someone.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.520
Yeah. Sorry about that.

09:28.600 --> 09:31.120
I've got Marlon's stuff
if you want to join?

09:32.960 --> 09:35.640
Nah, nah, I should um,
I should get back and

09:35.720 --> 09:37.200
get ready for the semis.

09:37.280 --> 09:38.560
Okay, cool.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.480
I mean I could
probably hang for a bit.

09:45.120 --> 09:46.120
Sounds great.

09:50.080 --> 09:51.760
I get what
you're going through.

09:52.840 --> 09:56.400
When I first moved here
from Brazil, super homesick.

09:56.480 --> 10:00.040
I didn't know anyone,
barely spoke the language.

10:00.120 --> 10:03.400
Yeah. Australian's a
tough dialect. Very slow.

10:03.480 --> 10:05.240
But seriously,
why would you want

10:05.320 --> 10:09.760
to go back to New York?
It's cold, all concrete.

10:09.840 --> 10:11.120
Is there even a beach there?

10:11.200 --> 10:12.680
Everything in the
world is there.

10:12.760 --> 10:16.040
I'm just saying,
you're in a beautiful place,

10:16.120 --> 10:18.080
hanging with the
coolest guy in town.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.040
Maybe your mum did you a favour.

10:24.720 --> 10:28.400
Less talking, Brazil.
More jet ski.

10:28.480 --> 10:31.400
This is the
world's slowest getaway.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.400
I saw an octopus under this
rock shelf the the other day.

11:44.480 --> 11:45.480
Follow me down?

11:45.560 --> 11:46.400
Yeah.

12:36.640 --> 12:40.960
Are you okay? I turned
around, you disappeared.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.480
Yeah.
I swallowed some sea water.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.080
It's not your lungs. Is it?

12:50.680 --> 12:53.440
Sorry, I just heard they
were damaged or something.

12:53.520 --> 12:57.000
One of them was.
But it's sweet now.

13:00.360 --> 13:04.200
Hey, so, um, how was your year?

13:05.160 --> 13:06.720
Ola!

13:12.080 --> 13:15.400
Do you hate him now?
What happened.

13:16.680 --> 13:20.520
No.
No, I don't hate anyone.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.160
Well, I'm sure you
guys will work it out.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.360
Bodhi! Why aren't
you back at the beach?

13:26.440 --> 13:27.640
I've got time.

13:27.720 --> 13:29.120
You always think you have time.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.600
Come on, I'll take you back.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.800
Yeah but, snap...

13:45.880 --> 13:49.080
Oh, there you are!
We thought we lost you.

13:49.160 --> 13:50.040
Not yet.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.480
Hey Summer,
I don't know if you remember

13:51.560 --> 13:53.160
but there used to be a big
frill-necked lizard

13:53.240 --> 13:56.640
live in the rocks over there,
you named her Lizzie.

13:56.720 --> 13:59.000
I don't, but cute.

14:00.360 --> 14:03.200
So are you guys going to
stay and watch Ari or?

14:03.280 --> 14:05.760
Oh, my domestic
schedule's pretty full today.

14:05.840 --> 14:09.480
Yeah he's not into
competition. Anyway,

14:09.560 --> 14:10.880
I got to go get changed.

14:12.040 --> 14:13.480
I might stay
and watch some of

14:13.560 --> 14:15.200
the dope surf stuff, so.

14:15.280 --> 14:18.720
Trust me, it gets
very dull very quickly.

14:19.760 --> 14:22.400
All right, you just get a
ride home with Ari, okay?

14:29.000 --> 14:31.360
So I guess this is goodbye?

14:31.440 --> 14:33.080
Yup. Bye.

14:37.120 --> 14:40.160
Yo, yo!
If it isn't the Prawn.

14:40.240 --> 14:43.200
Prawnie.
Yo, are you ready to go?

14:43.280 --> 14:44.040
I got to leave.

14:44.120 --> 14:45.240
All right, cool.
Just let me grab my stuff.

14:45.320 --> 14:46.440
Cool.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.480
Sheridan Morehouse
dominating

14:50.560 --> 14:54.480
this Under 16 Girls semi-finals
so far with five minutes to go.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.120
This hot shot
from Anchor Cove

14:56.200 --> 14:58.640
is a strong contender
for state selection.

15:00.960 --> 15:03.240
High hopes
for local girl Poppy Tetanui,

15:03.320 --> 15:04.800
especially after her
last performance,

15:04.880 --> 15:07.640
but her wave selection
hasn't been the best.

15:12.480 --> 15:15.480
Tetanui goes for it.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.120
Oh!

15:17.200 --> 15:18.840
Just runs out of room there.

15:20.240 --> 15:23.440
Come on Pops. That's why you got
to do your homework, girl.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.360
Hey look, I don't know about
you boys but it'll be nice

15:27.440 --> 15:29.240
if someone from Shorehaven
actually won something

15:29.320 --> 15:31.120
on our home break for once.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.200
How about we try to start
working together as a team, eh?

15:41.040 --> 15:42.200
And Sheridan Morehouse

15:42.280 --> 15:44.320
takes it out comfortably.

15:44.400 --> 15:47.280
Local hopefuls Bodhi
Mercer and Poppy Tetanui

15:47.360 --> 15:49.200
knocked out of the competition.

15:49.280 --> 15:52.440
Next up, the first of the
Under 16 Boys semi-finals.

15:52.520 --> 15:54.240
Pretty soon, we'll find out

15:54.320 --> 15:56.640
who will be battling
it out for that trophy.

15:57.760 --> 16:00.480
Here we are,
together again.

16:36.320 --> 16:38.240
I don't know, man.

16:38.320 --> 16:40.400
Man, you can stay if you want.

16:40.480 --> 16:41.800
I'm going to go get pitted!

16:50.560 --> 16:52.480
Let's jump together.

16:52.560 --> 16:55.000
-On three?
-Yeah.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.520
-One,
-One,

16:56.600 --> 16:57.400
-two,
-two,

16:57.480 --> 16:58.280
-three.
-three.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.200
Hold up. Just a minute.

17:34.280 --> 17:38.400
Yo, I've got to go,
no joke. Summer!

17:44.360 --> 17:47.520
Are you okay?
What happened?

17:49.040 --> 17:50.840
Is this some kind of joke?

17:52.360 --> 17:53.800
Are you epileptic?

17:54.760 --> 17:56.200
Diabetic?

17:56.280 --> 17:59.360
Is this something your family
really should've told me about?

18:00.920 --> 18:02.640
I said wait!

18:02.720 --> 18:04.200
Should I go get help?

18:04.280 --> 18:06.320
No, no, no. Please. Please stay.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.720
Okay. I can do that.

18:19.520 --> 18:21.160
Just try to breathe normal.

18:22.520 --> 18:24.000
In...

18:25.040 --> 18:26.400
Out...

18:28.600 --> 18:30.480
Hey, nothing's going
to happen to you.

18:31.640 --> 18:35.600
You're in a safe country,
in the world's most boring town.

18:37.640 --> 18:39.120
Everything's going to be okay.

18:45.680 --> 18:46.520
No.

18:48.720 --> 18:50.480
What is it?

18:50.560 --> 18:53.200
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

18:55.240 --> 18:56.800
This ever happen to you before?

18:57.920 --> 18:58.880
Nah.

18:58.960 --> 19:01.560
Pretty sure you're
having a panic attack.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.320
My last school was full of
high-achieving rich kids.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.840
Happened all the time.

19:05.920 --> 19:07.520
And a
6.2 for Marlon Sousa

19:07.600 --> 19:09.520
puts him in second place...

19:09.600 --> 19:12.880
Hey. You're meant to
be out there, right?

19:16.280 --> 19:17.120
I can't.

19:18.080 --> 19:19.560
Okay.

19:20.920 --> 19:23.240
You want me to get a surf nurse
or whatever you've got?

19:23.320 --> 19:26.560
No. What if it's just a one-off?

19:26.640 --> 19:27.560
It's not.

19:43.640 --> 19:44.920
We're also thinking,

19:45.000 --> 19:48.200
we're making a trip down to
the Mentawai's, so I don't

19:48.280 --> 19:51.120
know how you're placed but
we'd love you to come along.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.640
That sounds amazing,
I love Mentawai.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.320
Here he goes again.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.320
Reigning State Champ,
Griff Temple,

20:01.400 --> 20:03.440
has been absolutely cooking.

20:09.560 --> 20:13.040
Marlon Sousa
goes with the big 360 and...

20:14.400 --> 20:18.240
...oof, can't pull off
the high risk manoeuver.

20:21.800 --> 20:24.440
Griff Temple
continues his dominant run,

20:24.520 --> 20:27.080
as he takes out
the semi-final.

20:44.960 --> 20:47.640
Yo! Watch out!

20:52.440 --> 20:54.640
What the?
What's going on?

20:56.200 --> 20:57.600
Oh my God!

21:03.160 --> 21:04.800
Did she do that on purpose?

21:05.960 --> 21:06.840
My board!

21:06.920 --> 21:08.360
She's a monster.

21:08.440 --> 21:10.280
Oh is that yours?

21:11.320 --> 21:12.520
So sorry.

21:29.560 --> 21:32.080
You have
one new message.

21:33.280 --> 21:35.440
Summer,
it's your mother.

21:35.520 --> 21:37.760
I woke up to an alert
from the credit card company.

21:37.840 --> 21:40.200
You just had to
book business class.

21:40.280 --> 21:42.160
Did you seriously think
I wouldn't find out?

21:42.240 --> 21:46.960
Anyway, I've told Abbie
everything, so expect a chat.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.480
Summer I know
you're angry at me,

21:48.560 --> 21:51.000
but please don't
take it out on them.

21:51.080 --> 21:54.800
These are good people and
Shorehaven's a good place.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.320
I was happy there.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.800
Believe it or not,
you can be too.
