01:50.466 --> 01:53.233
Hi, guys! A '50s
party is a great idea.

01:54.400 --> 01:55.400
‐ Thank you.
‐ Thank you.

01:55.433 --> 01:56.233
[knock on door]

01:58.566 --> 02:00.433
‐ Hi!
‐ Hi, Mary Anne.

02:00.466 --> 02:01.500
Hi!

02:03.533 --> 02:04.333
I'm sorry we're late.

02:04.366 --> 02:06.466
I couldn't decide
what outfit to wear.

02:06.500 --> 02:09.100
Well, uh, Mary Anne
I could be wrong

02:09.133 --> 02:11.766
but that outfit doesn't look

02:11.800 --> 02:13.566
like something from the '50s.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.300
Oh, from the '50s.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.166
I thought we were
supposed to dress

02:23.200 --> 02:25.066
like we were in our fifties.

02:31.400 --> 02:35.000
I spent about...twenty minutes
on it and just gave up.

02:37.266 --> 02:38.633
Well, come on in.
Come on.

02:38.666 --> 02:41.200
‐ Is it okay?
‐ Yes. No, it's beautiful.

02:42.333 --> 02:43.333
Hi!

02:43.366 --> 02:44.366
Oh, hi!

02:46.333 --> 02:47.266
Lydia!

02:48.633 --> 02:50.666
Oh. This is my friend,
Lamont Cassidy.

02:50.700 --> 02:52.033
Oh, hi.

02:52.066 --> 02:54.500
Lamont is a hypnotherapist.

02:54.533 --> 02:57.066
Oh, really?
Then I need to talk to you.

02:57.100 --> 02:58.566
Because I got some
problems with my hip.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.500
I just don't know what it is.

03:00.533 --> 03:02.600
Does this leg look
shorter to you? Because..

03:02.633 --> 03:03.500
‐ Balki, Balki. Balki.
‐ You know the hip girdle..

03:04.800 --> 03:06.600
‐ It's at a funny angle.
‐ No, no, no.

03:06.633 --> 03:08.666
Not a hip therapist.

03:08.700 --> 03:10.266
A hypnotherapist.

03:10.300 --> 03:12.533
What that is?

03:12.566 --> 03:14.400
Well, that's someone
who uses hypnosis

03:14.433 --> 03:16.366
to put people to sleep

03:16.400 --> 03:19.766
and make them act like...dogs
and barnyard animals.

03:22.333 --> 03:24.133
Actually, I use hypnosis

03:24.166 --> 03:25.800
to break people of certain
behavioral patterns

03:25.833 --> 03:29.166
like smoking,
overeating...rudeness.

03:32.066 --> 03:35.200
Lamont has successfully cured
migraines

03:35.233 --> 03:39.100
back problems and a myriad
of sexual dysfunctions.

03:39.133 --> 03:40.200
And that was just for Lydia.

03:42.733 --> 03:45.733
Uh, uh, Mr. Cassidy,
could you show me

03:45.766 --> 03:47.700
how that you make
people go to sleep

03:47.733 --> 03:50.600
and then, and then,
eh, act like animals

03:50.633 --> 03:53.066
because I haven't seen a really
good mongoose impression

03:53.100 --> 03:54.766
since I left Mypos.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.400
Oh, I don't know about‐‐

03:56.433 --> 03:58.266
Oh, come on, Lamont.

03:58.300 --> 04:00.166
You can hypnotize me.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.533
You know how easy I am.

04:04.266 --> 04:06.233
To hypnotize.
Hypnotize.

04:08.566 --> 04:10.666
‐ Okay, sure.
‐ Oh, boy!

04:10.700 --> 04:12.433
Everybody, everybody!

04:12.466 --> 04:14.400
Mr. Cassidy is going
to hypnotize Lydia!

04:15.700 --> 04:16.565
Okay, honey.

04:17.433 --> 04:18.500
[laughing]

04:19.366 --> 04:21.132
Here we go.

04:21.166 --> 04:22.733
Now, Lydia,
concentrate on the watch.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.266
Your eyes are tired.

04:28.766 --> 04:30.000
'They're getting heavy.'

04:31.533 --> 04:32.733
You can hardly keep..

04:32.766 --> 04:33.766
[snoring]

04:35.433 --> 04:36.633
Boy, she is easy.

04:38.833 --> 04:41.666
Okay, now, Lydia,
when you hear a bell

04:41.700 --> 04:44.233
you'll become Charo.

04:44.266 --> 04:47.366
And you'll be Charo
until you hear the bell again.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.266
Oh, I love Charo!

04:49.300 --> 04:50.733
Especially when
he takes his sword

04:50.766 --> 04:52.600
and makes the sign
of the "Z."

04:56.633 --> 04:58.433
No. That's Zorro.

04:59.233 --> 05:00.733
This is Charo.

05:00.766 --> 05:03.200
‐ Oh, this is Charo!
‐ 'Yes.'

05:04.200 --> 05:06.300
When I snap my fingers..

05:06.333 --> 05:07.100
...you'll wake up.

05:09.533 --> 05:11.133
Oh.

05:11.166 --> 05:13.500
Oh, Lamont, I hope I didn't
do anything silly.

05:13.533 --> 05:16.066
‐ No. Of course not.
‐ Oh, good!

05:16.100 --> 05:18.666
Because, you know
as a nationally syndicated

05:18.700 --> 05:22.533
advice columnist, I have
to maintain a certain amount..

05:22.566 --> 05:25.266
[As Charo]
Coochi, coochi, coochi!

05:26.500 --> 05:29.233
I am so happy to be here.

05:29.266 --> 05:31.100
Could you lower the lights

05:31.133 --> 05:33.433
and I do a little
number for you.

05:33.466 --> 05:35.166
Arriba, Arriba! Arriba!

05:36.733 --> 05:40.733
To maintain a certain
amount of professionalism.

05:40.766 --> 05:42.600
You know, I have
a reputation to protect.

05:45.100 --> 05:48.233
Okay, when I clap my hands,
you'll wake up

05:48.266 --> 05:50.400
and you'll remember nothing
of what just happened.

05:52.666 --> 05:54.600
[applause]

05:54.633 --> 05:56.533
Oh. Thank you.
Thank you.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.066
You didn't make me
do the rooster, did you?

06:01.100 --> 06:02.166
No, no.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.700
That was wonderful.

06:08.733 --> 06:10.433
I don't believe it!

06:10.466 --> 06:12.766
I want you, I want you
to do that to my Cousin Larry.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.366
‐ Oh, no. No, no.
‐ Come on, cousin, please!

06:15.400 --> 06:16.766
I don't think so.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.233
There's no way
I could be hypnotized.

06:19.266 --> 06:20.566
My will is too strong.

06:27.233 --> 06:28.666
You might be surprised, Larry.

06:28.700 --> 06:30.266
Okay. Alright.

06:30.300 --> 06:31.400
Take your best shot.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.233
Oh. Make him somebody famous.

06:33.266 --> 06:34.566
[timer beeps]

06:34.600 --> 06:36.633
Oh, uh, I'll get
the pizza rolls.

06:36.666 --> 06:39.233
No, no, cousin, you stay here
and you let Mr. Cassidy

06:39.266 --> 06:40.266
eh, hypnotize you.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.200
I go get the pizza roll.

06:45.066 --> 06:47.466
Remember to, uh,
concentrate on the watch.

06:49.066 --> 06:51.600
‐ Your eyes are tired.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

06:51.633 --> 06:53.766
'Your eyelids
are getting heavy.'

06:56.066 --> 06:59.633
You can hardly keep them open.

06:59.666 --> 07:03.200
'You're getting
very, very sleepy.'

07:03.233 --> 07:07.533
You are falling
into a deep, deep sleep.

07:11.100 --> 07:13.166
When you hear a bell..

07:13.200 --> 07:15.100
...you'll think
that you're Elvis Presley

07:15.133 --> 07:17.766
and you will be Elvis
until you hear that bell again.

07:17.800 --> 07:21.466
Now, when I snap my fingers
...you'll wake up.

07:24.700 --> 07:26.766
'Wow.'

07:26.800 --> 07:28.533
What happened?
I‐I can't remember a thing.

07:31.600 --> 07:32.700
[As Marlon Brando]
I could have been a contender.

07:35.300 --> 07:36.733
'I could have been somebody'

07:36.766 --> 07:38.566
'instead of a bum,
which is what I am.'

07:43.100 --> 07:45.033
Wow! That's uncanny.

07:46.666 --> 07:48.500
Wait a minute.
That‐that's not Elvis.

07:48.533 --> 07:50.200
That's Marlon Brando.

07:52.266 --> 07:53.500
Well, I don't do Elvis.

07:53.533 --> 07:55.200
And I don't get
hypnotized either.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.266
Well, Larry's proved his point.

08:01.300 --> 08:03.366
Some people
can't get hypnotized.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.533
They're too rigid.

08:08.466 --> 08:10.566
Here I am. Thanks for waiting.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.100
Go ahead, Mr. Cassidy.
Hypnotize Cousin Larry.

08:42.566 --> 08:44.533
Uh, I'm sorry, ma'am.

08:44.566 --> 08:46.366
We don't have any
Balki Bartokomous here.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.366
How did you get this number?

08:51.600 --> 08:53.366
Uh, who you talkin' to?

08:53.400 --> 08:55.033
Well..

08:55.066 --> 08:56.400
...folks call me The King.

08:58.333 --> 08:59.533
Hold on.

08:59.566 --> 09:01.300
Red! You wanna take care
of this one?

09:01.333 --> 09:02.500
Pick up on three.

09:08.566 --> 09:11.133
I'm gonna fry me a peanut butter
and banana sandwich.

[instrumental music]

09:28.500 --> 09:30.566
Excuse me, mister.

09:30.600 --> 09:31.800
Where have you been?

09:31.833 --> 09:33.600
Well, uh..

09:33.633 --> 09:35.266
...I've been to Memphis.

09:37.166 --> 09:39.466
I've been to Nashville.

09:39.500 --> 09:40.666
I guess I've been more places

09:40.700 --> 09:42.100
than you can shake a stick at.

09:44.066 --> 09:47.100
What are you talking..
What happened to your accent?

09:47.133 --> 09:48.666
Well, uh, I've been
takin' actin' lessons.

09:50.333 --> 09:52.433
The colonel wants me
to make another picture.

09:52.466 --> 09:55.433
Look, uh,
I stopped by to return this.

09:55.466 --> 09:56.766
I found it in my pant's pocket.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.733
Well, of course you found
it in your pant's pocket.

09:58.766 --> 10:01.133
‐ It's your wallet.
‐ No, sir. It's not mine.

10:01.166 --> 10:04.366
It, uh, says it belongs
to a Balki Bartokomous.

10:10.100 --> 10:12.800
It says on the identification
card that he works here.

10:12.833 --> 10:14.366
Bad day to fool around.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.500
Look, I've got to run
this up to the city desk

10:15.533 --> 10:18.100
when I get back, I wanna take
a look at your tax return

10:18.133 --> 10:19.233
and run over the numbers.

10:19.266 --> 10:20.466
Alright, while you're gone

10:20.500 --> 10:22.333
I'm gonna run over
a number of my own.

10:24.066 --> 10:25.166
You do that.

10:29.466 --> 10:31.033
One, two..

10:31.066 --> 10:32.266
One, two, three, four..

10:42.533 --> 10:44.266
Oh, good.
You're here for the rehearsal.

10:44.300 --> 10:45.366
Okay.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.333
I'll show you
how the number goes.

10:47.366 --> 10:49.533
I stand up here like this
in front of my cell.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.366
The music comes in,
and I start to go like this.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.100
And then I come down
here like this.

11:04.700 --> 11:06.766
Now, now,
don't‐don't worry now

11:06.800 --> 11:09.233
because, uh,
I'm choreographin' this myself

11:09.266 --> 11:10.666
and I want everyone
to have fun.

11:10.700 --> 11:11.800
I want to work with you

11:11.833 --> 11:14.666

if we can get a little..

11:14.700 --> 11:17.600
Little in your, in your knees
and in your hips, man.

11:17.633 --> 11:18.800
You gotta just..

11:18.833 --> 11:19.600
...just let out
what you're feelin'.

11:19.633 --> 11:21.733
That's what music
is all about.

11:21.766 --> 11:23.500
Come on, baby.

11:23.533 --> 11:25.500
Burn me up this time.
Put a little fire into it.

11:25.533 --> 11:26.633

11:29.133 --> 11:31.466
If you don't start
behaving like yourself

11:31.500 --> 11:33.300

We gotta get to your tax audit.

12:17.166 --> 12:18.366
We'll run over
your return in the car.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.166
Cousin, I don't think
that's a good idea.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.533
We might get
tire marks on it.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.766
