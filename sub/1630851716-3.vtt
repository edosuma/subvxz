WEBVTT

00:02.621 --> 00:06.701
And I was to meet our new surveyor, Ah Yong. He failed to attend.

00:06.901 --> 00:09.861
A Chinese surveyor on his own things can go wrong.

00:14.261 --> 00:16.701
Hey! I know you, don't I? Don't think so.

00:16.901 --> 00:19.141
Annie worked here too? She was seeing someone.

00:19.341 --> 00:21.261
From the way she talked, it was someone that she loved.

00:21.461 --> 00:22.981
Said that she was... enfant.

00:23.181 --> 00:24.901
Pregnant? So I sent her to Grayson.

00:25.101 --> 00:27.941
I've never met the woman. She came to you for a service.

00:28.141 --> 00:29.701
We'll not be meeting again.

00:29.901 --> 00:33.061
A white man murdered that woman. That's where the blame needs to go.

00:35.301 --> 00:38.421
Wasn't them, those kids we killed. I was with one when he died.

00:38.621 --> 00:40.141
Said he saw a Chinaman.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.741
That was in her things.

01:06.701 --> 01:08.381
Yeah, I engraved that.

01:08.981 --> 01:11.141
Yeah, some of my best work, I reckon.

01:17.381 --> 01:19.221
And who paid for it?

01:35.981 --> 01:39.461
Cheung Lei has asked me to go over the numbers with her.

01:41.581 --> 01:43.381
You know what to say.

01:48.981 --> 01:50.621
You're not sick?

01:51.501 --> 01:54.181
Medicine from Wu. It's nothing.

03:46.021 --> 03:48.741
(WATER SPLASHES)

04:26.261 --> 04:27.901
Hello.

04:30.341 --> 04:32.381
Can I help?

05:43.301 --> 05:45.701
So? I don't know.

05:45.901 --> 05:49.581
You trust him too much. We should send him back to Zhongguo.

05:49.781 --> 05:51.701
He's my brother. We make sure.

05:51.901 --> 05:54.021
That he loved her or killed her?

05:55.341 --> 05:57.261
(SOFTLY) He didn't kill her.

05:57.461 --> 06:00.581
Even if he didn't, he's to blame.

06:03.101 --> 06:05.301
Lei has been asking for him.

06:05.501 --> 06:07.421
To go over the books.

06:09.061 --> 06:10.861
That's in hand.

06:14.661 --> 06:16.701
How much gold are we getting from the new seam?

06:16.901 --> 06:19.781
Haiyaa... With our gear?

06:19.981 --> 06:23.061
Each day, two coach fares to Melbourne and back.

06:23.261 --> 06:26.141
But if we had more men, and blasting powder...

06:26.341 --> 06:28.261
It's too loud.

06:28.941 --> 06:32.301
Halve the water ration, until production goes up.

06:34.221 --> 06:35.781
Do it.

06:36.901 --> 06:40.341
(MEN CONVERSE SOFTLY IN CANTONESE)

07:29.141 --> 07:31.261
..a fat fool. (GIGGLES)

08:07.741 --> 08:09.421
..discrepancy.

08:10.701 --> 08:12.501
When things don't add up.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.101
Indeed.

08:14.861 --> 08:17.901
Ballarat appears to magically produce more gold

08:18.101 --> 08:20.781
from the moment I began watching the books.

08:20.981 --> 08:25.821
A number of unproductive mines have reached workable seams, so...

08:44.541 --> 08:47.421
We took opium together once.

08:47.901 --> 08:51.021
Then when did your brother meet him? Why would he?

08:51.221 --> 08:54.021
We were told the surveyor reports to your father.

08:56.061 --> 08:58.741
I've seen accountants less skilled than you

08:58.941 --> 09:01.381
rise to the top of our Hing Dai Wui.

09:02.781 --> 09:06.821
And I've seen others with the blood puddled around their feet

09:07.021 --> 09:09.861
before they realise their throat is slit.

09:29.621 --> 09:33.741
I understand you and your men are looking for work. I can help.

09:37.421 --> 09:38.461
Water?

09:53.661 --> 09:58.741
Back home, our clans have had our... disagreements.

09:59.541 --> 10:01.781
But this is a new land.

10:02.421 --> 10:04.421
A fresh beginning.

10:04.621 --> 10:07.941
The new gold seam is a great opportunity for you and your men.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.781
(SPEAKS IN HAKKA)

10:10.501 --> 10:11.781
Half.

10:13.781 --> 10:16.181
Thirty or nothing.

10:31.861 --> 10:34.381
SPRUIKER: Evening Examiner! Here now.

10:34.581 --> 10:36.661
It's so fresh, mind your fingers for the ink.

10:36.861 --> 10:38.901
Patrick Thomas, hero of Ballarat town.

10:40.901 --> 10:44.261
Put a face to the name. Justice at the end of a gun.

10:50.301 --> 10:53.301
Every detail legal to print and a few more

10:53.501 --> 10:54.941
that ain't besides.

10:55.341 --> 10:57.101
That's it. Sold out, folks!

10:57.301 --> 10:59.141
Sold out. All gone.

11:17.741 --> 11:20.381
All you need is a bloody murder a week and you will be solvent.

11:20.581 --> 11:23.821
The Evening Examiner's running pictures now. Can we do that?

11:24.221 --> 11:27.381
Easy. With 60 quid for a new platen.

11:30.341 --> 11:31.501
Belle!

11:31.701 --> 11:34.301
As I said, always hard at work.

11:34.581 --> 11:37.061
I am. Is this a personal call or...?

11:37.261 --> 11:39.421
Oh, I thought I'd take the opportunity to introduce you to...

11:39.621 --> 11:42.981
(SPANISH ACCENT) Contessa Maria Dolores Montez.

11:43.181 --> 11:46.301
If you could get to the point... In my travels on the Continent...

11:46.501 --> 11:49.301
Warsaw, Dresden, Munich...

11:49.501 --> 11:53.221
and acclaimed performances for the heads of state, I found myself...

11:53.421 --> 11:55.501
In Ballarat.

11:56.301 --> 12:00.221
I have agreed to help the Contessa arrange a private performance this evening,

12:00.421 --> 12:02.101
for the most important members of town.

12:02.301 --> 12:05.541
And a preview in your publication, perhaps.

12:05.741 --> 12:07.861
Well, ladies must stick together.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.301
I'm afraid that doesn't make it news.

12:10.501 --> 12:13.781
And this is? Murder and bloodshed?

12:13.981 --> 12:16.541
You'd prefer a list of recipes and a cross-stitch pattern?

12:16.741 --> 12:19.981
We live in a sewer. Do I need to be reminded of it every moment?

12:20.181 --> 12:22.781
Perhaps just a bit of culture?

12:22.981 --> 12:25.181
A woman died. And life goes on.

12:25.381 --> 12:27.861
I don't need a lecture about that.

12:30.821 --> 12:32.981
If you'll excuse me, I have work to do.

12:38.101 --> 12:40.141
MAN: Come in here and collect your reward?

12:40.341 --> 12:43.661
Suppose you think you're some champion of the people now?

12:43.941 --> 12:46.701
Wouldn't have to be if you did your job.

12:46.901 --> 12:48.781
Bit of a coincidence, though.

12:49.821 --> 12:53.781
Them two boys... cutting her open like that.

12:54.821 --> 12:57.021
You just ride out...

12:57.221 --> 12:59.021
and shoot them dead.

13:00.501 --> 13:02.501
Don't quite square up with me.

13:02.701 --> 13:04.661
Does it square up with you, Weesel?

13:04.861 --> 13:07.301
Don't square up with me neither, sir.

13:17.581 --> 13:19.301
Are we done?

13:36.581 --> 13:38.341
Almost forgot.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.861
This was on her, too.

13:47.421 --> 13:49.541
Pennyroyal, it's called.

13:50.941 --> 13:52.981
Whores use it.

14:23.021 --> 14:26.221
And which of you handsome men is from the press?

14:26.421 --> 14:29.661
(CROWD LAUGHS)

14:29.981 --> 14:31.461
You, there!

14:31.901 --> 14:34.181
Is that Patrick Thomas?

14:36.261 --> 14:38.821
Indeed it is, in the flesh.

14:39.021 --> 14:43.381
Ladies and gentlemen, the Patrick Thomas.

14:43.861 --> 14:46.741
Hero who avenged his wife's murder

14:46.941 --> 14:50.581
in a gunfight with the blood-thirstiest of desperados.

14:50.781 --> 14:53.141
And, no doubt,

14:53.341 --> 14:56.501
appreciator of the dramatic arts.

14:58.261 --> 15:00.541
(IRISH ACCENT) You've knocked me off the front page.

15:00.741 --> 15:03.341
So be a fuckin' doll and play along.

(SPANISH ACCENT) A free ticket for the man who risked his life

(CROWD CHEERS)

15:16.301 --> 15:19.181

15:25.821 --> 15:28.181
You there, Mr Thomas. May we talk?

15:29.501 --> 15:31.701
You have my condolences for your wife's death.

15:31.901 --> 15:33.701
I just have a question.

15:43.861 --> 15:46.901
You're that Chinese protector, ain't you?

15:47.301 --> 15:49.101
Why don't you go bother them?

15:49.301 --> 15:51.701
Were there any Chinese involved?

15:51.901 --> 15:54.621
In what? The shooting of the outlaw.

15:55.741 --> 15:58.261
What the fuck are you talking about?

16:00.541 --> 16:02.101
My mistake.

16:02.861 --> 16:05.541
Though, please. You have my condolences.

16:33.021 --> 16:34.781
Payment is in advance.

16:47.781 --> 16:49.541
The rash is on my arm.

16:49.741 --> 16:51.901
Diagnosis requires data.

16:55.901 --> 16:59.421
Is that why they brought the lady's body to you?

17:00.261 --> 17:03.421
That's what it says in the paper. Sensationalist drivel.

17:03.621 --> 17:06.181
Dead and good riddance is all needs to be said.

17:07.221 --> 17:09.581
You knew her. The type.

17:09.861 --> 17:11.581
And what's that?

17:11.781 --> 17:15.501
For the ignorant, one human is like another.

17:15.701 --> 17:19.261
However, science reveals we are separate species.

17:20.021 --> 17:22.301
The thickened nerves of the black, for example,

17:22.501 --> 17:26.861
allow them to feel less emotion, withstand pain.

17:27.141 --> 17:29.821
Even the removal of an arm or leg.

17:30.621 --> 17:32.701
They continue as if it were a scratch.

17:34.141 --> 17:36.181
And what's this to do with the woman?

17:36.381 --> 17:38.021
When the species mix,

17:38.221 --> 17:41.301
the result carries the lowest traits of both.

17:42.661 --> 17:44.541
You think she mixed with a black?

17:46.221 --> 17:49.341
There are other options.

17:52.661 --> 17:55.741
But like I said, I only knew her...

17:55.941 --> 17:58.061
Type. Yes.

17:58.261 --> 18:02.421
Miasmas, foul smells, no doubt from your mode of living,

18:02.621 --> 18:05.101
have lodged in your circulatory system.

18:05.381 --> 18:07.341
There is only one cure.

18:19.421 --> 18:21.701
You happy with that? That's a fair price.

18:30.141 --> 18:31.901
Ready for another?

18:32.581 --> 18:34.261
Too right, love.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.701
Need a couple to face this lot.

18:37.741 --> 18:40.101
I'm looking for Rosie. What for?

18:40.301 --> 18:42.261
I thought maybe she hadn't told me everything.

18:42.461 --> 18:44.741
Maybe. But she ain't here.

18:45.061 --> 18:46.621
Where, then?

18:59.741 --> 19:01.901
Tuesday, she's with the celestials.

19:02.101 --> 19:04.781
Chinese? You wouldn't catch me at it.

19:06.661 --> 19:09.461
How well did Rosie and Annie Thomas know one another?

19:09.661 --> 19:12.581
Pretty good, I'd say. They met down at that camp.

19:20.261 --> 19:23.861
They've just arrived. Leader says they're from Buckland River.

19:27.381 --> 19:29.421
How did everything go with Cheung Lei?

19:29.621 --> 19:31.301
I threw her off.

20:52.541 --> 20:54.541
What do we do with them?

20:55.701 --> 20:58.421
Give them food. Put them to work.

20:58.621 --> 21:00.181
Where?

21:00.621 --> 21:02.461
We wanted more men.

21:05.061 --> 21:08.101
Put them to work in the new mine. If they work hard...

21:08.301 --> 21:10.061
keep a secret...

21:10.501 --> 21:13.341
maybe they can still make their fortune.

22:06.621 --> 22:08.581
WOMAN: You asked for me?

22:21.141 --> 22:24.221
I need to find a fella. A tracker.

22:25.021 --> 22:28.901
Was helping a white woman who got killed. Might be shot.

22:29.741 --> 22:31.421
What you want him for?

22:35.581 --> 22:39.261
Someone lied to me. Made me do something.

22:39.461 --> 22:41.781
I need to know the truth.

22:43.261 --> 22:45.461
Tom's a bad fella.

22:45.661 --> 22:47.181
Tom?

22:47.981 --> 22:49.301
Where is he?

22:49.501 --> 22:51.661
He went to work for the white cops.

22:51.861 --> 22:54.621
Stay away. He's nothing but trouble.

22:58.021 --> 23:00.221
I just want to know where he is.

23:08.621 --> 23:12.381
(COUGHING)

23:31.381 --> 23:32.901
Tom...

23:38.061 --> 23:39.421
Just water.

23:46.101 --> 23:48.901
(SIGHS) Who are you?

23:50.501 --> 23:52.941
That mob over there hate me.

23:53.381 --> 23:55.061
Why not you?

23:55.261 --> 23:57.061
You want something?

23:58.181 --> 23:59.621
A story.

23:59.821 --> 24:01.901
What happened to the woman?

24:02.101 --> 24:04.221
The white woman who died.

24:04.421 --> 24:06.221
Why do you care?

24:06.421 --> 24:09.341
People believe what version of the truth that suits them.

24:09.541 --> 24:11.101
I'm sick of that way.

24:11.741 --> 24:14.021
(COUGHS) Tom...

24:14.221 --> 24:15.381
Durrumang!

24:15.661 --> 24:17.461
My name is Durrumang!

24:17.661 --> 24:19.181
Durrumang.

24:22.141 --> 24:23.861
I took her.

24:24.381 --> 24:26.141
Two of them and me.

24:26.821 --> 24:28.741
Then the whitefellas came.

24:28.941 --> 24:31.981
They shot... They killed her? The outlaws?

24:34.181 --> 24:36.141
Moonface.

24:36.661 --> 24:39.701
What? Moonface?

24:40.221 --> 24:42.181
Chinee man.

24:43.301 --> 24:45.541
It was a Chinee man who killed her.

26:01.461 --> 26:04.341
Excuse me, I'm looking for a woman who...

26:05.981 --> 26:08.101
Excuse me, do you speak English?

26:13.181 --> 26:15.821
Does ANYBODY speak English?

26:21.661 --> 26:24.741
Ah, excuse me. Hello. Do you speak English?

26:24.941 --> 26:28.021
English I can help with, Mrs Roberts.

26:28.541 --> 26:30.581
But possibly not what you are looking for.

26:30.781 --> 26:33.341
You know my name, um, Madam...

26:33.541 --> 26:35.061
Cheung.

26:35.541 --> 26:39.461
A lady who owns her own newspaper becomes known.

26:40.221 --> 26:42.621
You are looking for...? Rosie.

26:42.821 --> 26:44.381
She...

26:46.101 --> 26:47.821
..provides a service.

26:49.061 --> 26:51.741
The name is unfamiliar.

26:54.181 --> 26:56.021
Fetch the headman.

27:03.741 --> 27:05.221
Tell me...

27:05.421 --> 27:09.181
do many English women run their own businesses?

27:09.781 --> 27:13.781
It's not unheard of, though it's not without its difficulties.

27:17.861 --> 27:22.261
Life is difficulties. But you are free to do as you wish?

27:23.381 --> 27:25.181
More or less.

27:25.821 --> 27:30.181
In China, a widow is expected to marry her husband's brother,

27:30.381 --> 27:33.381
in order to fulfil her responsibilities.

27:33.581 --> 27:34.941
Responsibilities?

27:35.141 --> 27:36.941
Childbirth.

27:37.981 --> 27:40.261
It is considered our highest value.

27:41.621 --> 27:43.181
And you disagree?

27:44.381 --> 27:47.221
One is worth what one is worth.

27:47.421 --> 27:51.981
An ounce of gold here has a different price in Melbourne... in London.

27:52.181 --> 27:54.141
It changes every day.

27:58.741 --> 28:00.341
Tell me...

28:00.541 --> 28:04.141
did you marry for love or necessity?

28:09.181 --> 28:11.501
I thought we loved each other.

28:11.701 --> 28:13.101
For a time.

28:13.301 --> 28:17.461
It was his business too, is it not, that you continue?

28:18.061 --> 28:20.061
Is it what you have wished for yourself?

28:20.861 --> 28:23.541
Well, no one ever survived on wishes.

28:23.741 --> 28:25.461
Indeed not.

28:28.181 --> 28:29.661
Miss Belle...

28:29.861 --> 28:32.381
Have you tried ting tong mein?

28:38.101 --> 28:41.781
Your husband, he was considered important?

28:41.981 --> 28:43.861
Amongst some.

28:44.061 --> 28:46.661
"A great man", people would say.

28:46.861 --> 28:48.621
Many still do.

28:48.901 --> 28:50.501
And in private?

28:52.981 --> 28:54.901
He was not the same.

28:56.461 --> 28:58.501
Men do not love things.

28:58.701 --> 29:01.261
They only fear losing what they have.

29:01.541 --> 29:04.021
From the outside, it looks the same.

29:04.301 --> 29:06.461
Until you learn.

29:14.141 --> 29:16.901
Our headman arrives. As if on cue.

29:18.621 --> 29:22.581
Miss Belle needs your help finding an enterprising young woman.

29:23.141 --> 29:25.181
The name? Rosie.

29:30.581 --> 29:33.261
For what reason? She knew the murdered woman.

29:33.461 --> 29:36.421
Surely that story is done now that the killer has been announced

29:36.621 --> 29:38.221
and the outlaws brought to justice.

29:38.421 --> 29:40.141
Do you know where she is or not?

29:42.941 --> 29:44.341
Right this way.

29:48.461 --> 29:49.861
Thank you.

29:51.181 --> 29:53.301
(MUFFLED LAUGHTER)

30:12.261 --> 30:13.621
Knocking's customary.

30:13.821 --> 30:15.861
You never told me you provided service for this camp.

30:16.061 --> 30:17.661
They bathe more than once a year.

30:17.861 --> 30:19.821
They ain't drunk out of their skull half the time.

30:20.021 --> 30:22.421
Why did you lie about how well you knew Annie Thomas?

30:22.621 --> 30:25.581
I didn't. I just didn't mention everything.

30:25.781 --> 30:27.461
That you and her were friends?

30:29.581 --> 30:31.181
Friends is a stretch.

30:31.901 --> 30:35.581
She talked to you about her pregnancy. What else?

30:35.821 --> 30:39.621
None of that's my business. Why was she out in the bush that night?

30:39.821 --> 30:42.581
All I know is she was running away. With her lover?

30:48.381 --> 30:50.021
She was scared.

30:50.221 --> 30:52.621
Might be. Of who?

30:54.901 --> 30:56.941
That, I don't know.

31:02.181 --> 31:05.181
But if I had to guess, maybe...

31:05.381 --> 31:07.341
something to do with that Grayson.

31:08.261 --> 31:10.461
Something that he knew.

31:11.581 --> 31:13.861
You think it's wise to open old wounds?

31:14.061 --> 31:16.221
You misunderstand the purpose of the news.

31:16.421 --> 31:18.701
And you misunderstand my responsibilities.

31:18.901 --> 31:20.781
Well, enlighten me.

31:21.261 --> 31:23.101
I'm the headman of this camp.

31:23.301 --> 31:25.621
If there's more to come about what happened to that woman, I...

31:25.821 --> 31:27.141
Annie?

31:27.341 --> 31:29.021
Yes, Annie.

31:29.501 --> 31:32.421
I'd be the first to want to know. The truth.

31:32.621 --> 31:36.141
And doubly so if it has anything to do with this camp or anyone in it.

31:37.221 --> 31:38.981
This is my job.

31:39.181 --> 31:40.861
I can help.

31:41.221 --> 31:43.781
But I need to know what's going on.

31:45.981 --> 31:48.101
The man Rosie mentioned, Grayson,

31:48.301 --> 31:50.701
he's the doctor who gave Annie the pennyroyal.

31:51.261 --> 31:53.381
Pennyroyal? It's an abortifacient.

31:53.581 --> 31:55.661
It gets rid of the baby.

31:58.101 --> 31:59.861
What did he tell you?

32:00.061 --> 32:02.221
He's not forthcoming.

32:02.701 --> 32:04.701
But perhaps if he were more relaxed...

32:04.901 --> 32:05.621
How?

32:05.821 --> 32:08.021
I've been invited to a performance tonight at the theatre.

32:08.221 --> 32:09.821
Grayson will more than likely be there.

32:10.301 --> 32:12.301
Then I can come along, too.

32:12.861 --> 32:15.221
We can work on him together.

32:17.941 --> 32:20.981
It's evening wear. I have a suitable jacket.

32:22.661 --> 32:24.341
Then I'll meet you there.

32:25.061 --> 32:27.381
Good, then. Good, then.

32:39.141 --> 32:40.501
(KNOCKING)

32:40.701 --> 32:43.501
MAN: Open up! Open up, it's the police.

32:48.861 --> 32:51.101
I hereby charge you...

32:52.101 --> 32:55.181
..with being a sober bastard. What the fuck do you want?

32:55.381 --> 32:58.021
Listen... listen.

32:59.221 --> 33:01.261
Me and you didn't get off to a good start.

33:01.461 --> 33:03.821
You'll be facing a bad end if you don't fuck off!

33:04.021 --> 33:06.421
I took the measure of you.

33:08.061 --> 33:09.421
I was wrong.

33:09.741 --> 33:13.141
Takes a man to own up to his mistakes, now, don't it?

33:13.341 --> 33:16.501
All of us workers have got to stick together.

33:16.701 --> 33:22.021
All of us on our own ain't worth a shit, but united... we're strong.

33:22.221 --> 33:26.301
And for that... we could use a man like you.

33:30.781 --> 33:34.621
And aye. Looks like you could use some company.

33:34.821 --> 33:36.101
Eh?

33:44.101 --> 33:45.661
(CRIES IN PAIN)

35:42.061 --> 35:43.021
Ah Sun...

35:46.821 --> 35:48.661
I need to talk to you.

35:52.181 --> 35:53.621
Good.

35:53.821 --> 35:55.781
I have something to tell you.

35:56.821 --> 35:59.541
I asked around, like you said.

36:00.741 --> 36:02.301
It was Ah Yong.

36:03.061 --> 36:06.501
The surveyor. He was sleeping with the white lady.

36:06.701 --> 36:08.661
He bought her gifts.

36:08.861 --> 36:10.981
The box must be his.

36:11.781 --> 36:14.741
I spoke to the engraver who inscribed it.

36:16.301 --> 36:17.941
He said it was you.

36:19.781 --> 36:22.581
No, he must be confused. We both have glasses, so...

36:22.781 --> 36:24.101
Stop.

36:25.181 --> 36:26.741
Stop lying.

36:26.941 --> 36:28.101
I'm not.

36:28.301 --> 36:30.461
You believe I'm the only one who can see through this?

36:30.661 --> 36:33.181
What do you think will happen to you if the 'gwailou' find out?

36:57.141 --> 36:58.541
Do you?

40:32.541 --> 40:34.541
You looking for that dead bitch's husband?

40:34.741 --> 40:37.661
(CHUCKLES) Already speaking ill of the dead.

40:37.861 --> 40:40.381
The likes she cavorted with, I'll speak how I want.

40:40.581 --> 40:42.861
Oh, yeah? Who was she cavorting with?

40:43.861 --> 40:46.101
One of them darkies.

40:46.661 --> 40:48.821
What you talking about? The tracker.

40:49.021 --> 40:53.661
I saw her paying him off, the day she disappeared.

40:58.341 --> 41:00.021
Which darky?

41:57.541 --> 42:00.341
You're late. I wasn't sure you'd make it.

42:00.741 --> 42:02.541
I appreciate your patience.

42:02.741 --> 42:04.221

Allow me.

You came.

Oh. And I see you've brought a companion.

Dr Grayson, the pennyroyal you gave to Annie...

47:21.341 --> 47:25.461
I've spoke to the women who recommended you to Annie for just that purpose.

47:26.581 --> 47:30.661
If you'd prefer, I can simply print every detail, including your part.

47:30.861 --> 47:33.701
Or perhaps you have things wrong. He clearly doesn't know.

47:33.901 --> 47:36.661
She asked me for an abortifacient.

47:37.261 --> 47:40.181
I gave it to her. That's all.

47:40.381 --> 47:43.341
Then why was she scared? Don't play the ingenue.

47:43.541 --> 47:48.141
She was obviously afraid the birth would expose her lover as a Chinese.

47:49.261 --> 47:51.941
I'm sure you can't know for certain that she had a Chinese...

47:52.141 --> 47:55.861
She asked how the miscegenist brat would turn out.

47:56.061 --> 47:58.381
It's hardly difficult to puzzle.

47:58.581 --> 48:02.061
