Faster than a greyhound.

21:37.280 --> 21:38.640
Vern!

21:38.760 --> 21:42.040
I was just digging
up some bulbs.

21:42.160 --> 21:43.400
How are you?

21:43.520 --> 21:46.240
Fine, but my parents
haven't been well.

21:46.360 --> 21:47.560
What happened?

21:47.680 --> 21:48.920
Well, Da spent the
night in the hospital

21:49.040 --> 21:50.120
with some kind of blood problem.

21:50.240 --> 21:52.200
[music playing]

21:52.320 --> 21:54.080
That's terrible.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.640
They blame the lamingtons.

21:56.760 --> 21:58.560
How could that be possible?

21:58.680 --> 22:00.760
They were poisoned.

22:00.880 --> 22:01.680
No!

22:01.800 --> 22:03.120
Oh, I didn't get any.

22:03.240 --> 22:04.400
I'm not fond of
coconut in a cake.

22:04.520 --> 22:07.200
It's like eating horse hair.

22:07.320 --> 22:09.040
But I forgive you, Rita.

22:09.160 --> 22:13.440
And I can take anything
you throw at me--

22:13.560 --> 22:15.080
except you having
sex with that man.

22:17.720 --> 22:20.160
He's my husband.

22:20.280 --> 22:21.960
And you don't have to watch.

22:22.080 --> 22:22.880
I want you, Rita.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
I need you.

22:24.120 --> 22:27.360
Vern, this has to stop.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.000
I know you think
I'm young and useless,

22:29.120 --> 22:33.200

22:39.000 --> 22:40.040
I grew it.

22:40.160 --> 22:41.200
And I'm going to sell it.

22:43.960 --> 22:45.280
That's very enterprising.

22:45.400 --> 22:47.560
Well, I met some crazy
people in Hawke's Bay--

Blerta.
They have land.

22:49.440 --> 22:50.600
They all live together.

You know I could
never share a kitchen.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.720
Oh, I'm looking
at a place at Huia--

22:55.840 --> 22:58.760
for us.

22:58.880 --> 23:00.200
What about Wolf?

23:00.320 --> 23:02.760
He would come, of course.

23:02.880 --> 23:06.040
And we could find our ownlittle boy, take him back.

23:06.160 --> 23:07.360
He's ours, Rita.

23:07.480 --> 23:08.960
He should be with us.

23:09.080 --> 23:10.720
I don't know where
he went to, and I

23:10.840 --> 23:12.440
don't want to talk about it.

23:12.560 --> 23:15.680
Rita, I know the sufferingyou've been through,

23:15.800 --> 23:18.000
but we are meant to be together.

Of course, love.

23:54.640 --> 23:55.920
I liked it better
when it was just is.

23:56.040 --> 23:58.080
It couldn't stay that way.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.000
I can get us money.

24:04.320 --> 24:06.120
That's sweet, honey.

24:06.240 --> 24:07.200
But things will get better soon.

Well, I'll still be here.

26:52.240 --> 26:53.840
So you're not moving along?

26:53.960 --> 26:55.880
It's a metaphor, Bert.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.320
Sometimes, you have a
different philosophy,
