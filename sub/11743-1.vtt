Yes.

01:09.585 --> 01:12.253
Hi. Hi, Claire.

01:12.254 --> 01:16.289
Trust me. One day you'll watch this and thank
me for capturing your last night of freedom.

01:16.290 --> 01:20.261
So come on, you're on.

01:20.262 --> 01:24.265
Okay. Hi, I'm Claire Russell...

01:24.266 --> 01:26.434
soon to be Clair Russell-Morris...

01:26.435 --> 01:28.736
as I'm getting married
next Saturday.

01:28.737 --> 01:30.138
Whoo!

01:30.139 --> 01:32.206
And we're on our way to Vegas.

01:32.207 --> 01:33.708
For my bachelorette party.

01:33.709 --> 01:36.309
Whoo!

01:36.310 --> 01:38.746
Yeah!

01:38.747 --> 01:40.915
I don't know what else to say.
I feel stupid.

01:40.916 --> 01:45.286
Just say anything.
Say whatever you want.

01:45.287 --> 01:46.721
I'm in love.

01:46.722 --> 01:49.390
With my soul mate Dave Morris...

01:49.391 --> 01:52.459
and I can't believe it...

01:52.460 --> 01:57.597
but I really did find the one.

01:57.598 --> 01:59.367
Punch buggy.

01:59.368 --> 02:00.373
Ow.

02:04.373 --> 02:06.941
I'm Zoe.
I'm Claire's best friend.

02:06.942 --> 02:08.910
And not a lot of people know...

02:08.911 --> 02:10.178
but when Claire was 12...

02:10.179 --> 02:11.479
I taught her how to kiss.

02:11.480 --> 02:12.447
Shut up.

02:12.448 --> 02:14.782
We need to get everything
out in the open.

02:14.783 --> 02:17.484
No, but... But seriously.
No joke.

02:17.485 --> 02:18.752
You are my BFF...

02:18.753 --> 02:21.288
and you've always
been there for me.

02:21.289 --> 02:23.524
Whenever I've been in trouble.

02:23.525 --> 02:25.825
Yeah, like...

02:25.826 --> 02:28.196
Like anything.

02:28.197 --> 02:29.530
You've always been there for me.

02:29.531 --> 02:31.431
And even though
you're getting hitched...

02:31.432 --> 02:33.234
we're still going to have
a girls' night out, right?

02:33.235 --> 02:34.368
Yes, Zoe.

02:34.369 --> 02:36.574
I love this girl.

02:38.574 --> 02:39.775
Punch buggy!

02:41.877 --> 02:45.912
All right, Leslie, you're up.

02:45.913 --> 02:47.247
Pass.

02:47.248 --> 02:51.419
Come on.
Just say who you are.

02:51.420 --> 02:54.788
Leslie bowman,
Clair's wiser older sister...

02:54.789 --> 02:56.791
only by a couple of years.

02:56.792 --> 02:58.425
Five, but who's counting?

02:58.426 --> 03:02.700
Yeah, burn.
Burn. Sss.

03:05.700 --> 03:08.436
I'm sorry. How do you and
Claire even know each other?

03:08.437 --> 03:10.238
I have a mobile
dog grooming business...

03:10.239 --> 03:11.938
you know, the kind
that go to your house.

03:11.939 --> 03:13.974
Oh.

03:13.975 --> 03:17.345
Yeah, I've been shaving Claire's
muffin for about three years now.

03:17.346 --> 03:18.645
Her dog's name is scout.

03:18.646 --> 03:23.551
I know. I was talking
about her pussy.

03:26.888 --> 03:29.324
Punch... Punch...

03:37.866 --> 03:38.865

03:40.269 --> 03:41.334
Oh, yeah.

03:41.336 --> 03:42.870
We're on our way to Vegas.

03:42.871 --> 03:44.472
- Oh, you're on your way to Vegas?
- Yeah.

03:44.473 --> 03:46.274

03:46.275 --> 03:47.675

04:05.294 --> 04:06.626
We should grab a bottle.

04:06.627 --> 04:08.496
I really gotta pee.

04:08.497 --> 04:10.364
Where do we use the restroom?

04:10.365 --> 04:11.931
- Outside.
- Outside?

04:11.932 --> 04:14.835
What did you get?
Oh, you got a wine.

04:14.836 --> 04:16.303
Whoo! Party in the bathroom.

04:16.305 --> 04:19.373
Don't drink all my wine.

04:19.374 --> 04:21.309
Is it good?

04:21.310 --> 04:22.342

Okay, let's go over
the itinerary.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.135
We check into the hotel...

05:54.136 --> 05:55.602
penthouse suite of course.

05:55.603 --> 05:57.006
Hey, I don't go
no penthouse money.

05:58.006 --> 05:59.506
Relax. It's on me.

05:59.507 --> 06:01.075
Leslie married a rich dude.

06:01.076 --> 06:04.911
She's a one-percenter.

06:04.912 --> 06:07.148
We'll have a privately
catered in-suite dinner...

06:07.149 --> 06:08.816
lobster, caviar, the works.

06:08.817 --> 06:09.884
Lobster!

06:11.819 --> 06:13.888
Then we'll see Celine Dion
in concert...

06:13.889 --> 06:14.888
front row center seats.

06:14.889 --> 06:17.424
Wake up to brunch pool side
at the Bellagio.

06:17.425 --> 06:18.825
Thank you, Leslie.

06:18.826 --> 06:21.862
It sounds amazing.
It's very generous of you.

06:21.863 --> 06:23.763
Yeah, sounds awesome.

06:23.764 --> 06:26.002
But I never heard the words
"man-ass" or "footlong"

06:27.002 --> 06:30.171
anywhere in your itinerary.

06:30.172 --> 06:33.773
That's because it's not that
kind of bachelorette party.

06:33.774 --> 06:35.775
Oh.

06:35.776 --> 06:36.942
What about games?

06:36.943 --> 06:38.678
What game?

06:38.680 --> 06:40.147
The bachelorette party game.

06:40.148 --> 06:42.183
You know, like,
getting a random guy.

06:42.184 --> 06:43.650
To give us his underwear.

06:43.651 --> 06:46.854
Or kissing a dude
with a mustache.

06:46.855 --> 06:49.890
Uh, no.

06:49.891 --> 06:51.528
Cool.

06:54.528 --> 06:58.866
Show us your tits!

06:58.867 --> 07:01.135
You show us your balls.

07:01.136 --> 07:06.841
Show her your balls.

07:08.175 --> 07:09.081
Yeah, baby!

07:13.081 --> 07:15.817

We have a reservation

07:44.946 --> 07:46.614
Leslie bowman.

07:46.615 --> 07:51.551
Okay, have fun,
but not too much fun.

07:51.552 --> 07:52.852
Love you, too.

07:52.853 --> 07:53.888
Bye.

07:53.889 --> 07:55.490
What's Dave doing
for his bachelor party?

07:55.990 --> 07:57.590
His friends got a hotel room.

07:57.591 --> 08:00.659
For poker night
and "entertainment".

08:00.660 --> 08:02.530
You're okay with that?

08:02.531 --> 08:04.265
It's his bachelor party.

08:04.266 --> 08:05.900
Boys will be boys.

08:05.901 --> 08:07.101
But I trust him.

08:07.102 --> 08:08.768
Sucker.

08:08.769 --> 08:11.036
I have you for one night
in the penthouse.

08:11.038 --> 08:13.140
Excellent,
that's our most opulent suite.

08:13.141 --> 08:14.775
It's over 3,000 square feet.

08:14.776 --> 08:15.976
With four separate
bedroom suites...

08:15.977 --> 08:18.244
marble baths,
eight flat screens...

08:18.245 --> 08:19.746
and a full time Butler.

08:19.747 --> 08:22.220
Holy shit,
I think I just squirted.

08:25.219 --> 08:26.253
Perfect.

08:26.254 --> 08:28.188
The room is $4,500 a night...

08:28.189 --> 08:30.899
and I'll need a credit card deposit
for additional incidentals.

08:37.899 --> 08:39.765
I'm sorry, Mrs. Bowman...

08:39.767 --> 08:43.582
but your credit card representative
would like to speak with you.

08:54.583 --> 08:55.815
Wonder what happened.

08:55.816 --> 08:58.117
I don't know.

08:58.118 --> 09:01.188
Someone got hold of my credit card
numbers and just charged up a storm.

09:01.189 --> 09:02.789
Oh, no!

09:02.790 --> 09:04.924
But the credit card company
cancelled the cards.

09:04.925 --> 09:07.060
I won't get new cards
for a couple of days.

09:07.061 --> 09:08.628
I'm sorry.

09:08.629 --> 09:11.664
Look, we don't need
the penthouse suite anyway.

09:11.665 --> 09:13.132
How much for just a normal room?

09:13.133 --> 09:15.202
I'm sorry, but we're
completely booked.

09:15.203 --> 09:16.971
Seriously? Nothing?

09:16.972 --> 09:20.676
I wish I could help, but there's
a shoe convention this weekend.

09:22.676 --> 09:25.245
You're going to have a tough
time finding a room anywhere.

09:25.246 --> 09:27.081
Check these out!

09:27.082 --> 09:28.214
I got us bathrobes.

09:28.215 --> 09:31.318
Egyptian cotton, super comfy.

09:31.319 --> 09:33.226
You mind if I charge these
to the room?

09:38.226 --> 09:39.734
What?

09:46.734 --> 09:51.640
Okay. Okay, thank you.
Bye-bye.

09:52.741 --> 09:55.141
Now, it's nothing fancy,
but I got us a room.

09:55.142 --> 09:56.953
Yeah!

10:04.952 --> 10:07.092
This isn't that bad.

10:11.092 --> 10:11.993
Oh, God.

10:12.993 --> 10:15.000
- What?
- Nothing. Nothing.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.074
Home sweet home.

10:26.074 --> 10:28.141
Ugh.

10:28.142 --> 10:31.145
I call bed!

10:31.146 --> 10:33.380
- Comfy?
- Yes.

10:33.381 --> 10:36.116
Very comfy.

10:36.117 --> 10:37.284
This place is a dump.

10:37.285 --> 10:38.952
No, it's fine.

10:38.953 --> 10:40.358
Oh.

10:43.358 --> 10:44.791
What's that?

10:44.792 --> 10:46.025
It's a black light app.

10:46.026 --> 10:48.103
To show us if
the sheets are clean.

10:56.103 --> 10:57.737
- Ew.
- Oh.

10:57.738 --> 10:59.106
What? What?

10:59.107 --> 11:03.309
Oh, my God,
I think they're moving.

11:03.310 --> 11:04.445
Janet...

11:07.348 --> 11:09.116
Get it off!

11:09.117 --> 11:12.318
Get it off! Get it off! Oh, God!

11:12.319 --> 11:14.887
What's that?

11:14.888 --> 11:15.788
Oh, oh.

11:15.989 --> 11:18.358
- Over here.
- Get them off!

11:31.739 --> 11:35.112
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:39.113 --> 11:41.087
Oh, no!

11:46.087 --> 11:50.823
This is our room.

11:50.824 --> 11:54.026
And there's
my pissed-off sister.

11:54.027 --> 11:55.462
I can't believe we're staying.

11:55.463 --> 11:57.097
It's Vegas.

11:57.098 --> 11:59.966
How much time are we gonna
spend in the room anyway?

11:59.967 --> 12:02.836
Yeah, it's about being together.

12:02.837 --> 12:04.357
Well, I am sleeping
in the car tonight.

12:08.843 --> 12:10.043
Let's go already!

12:10.044 --> 12:12.919
I'll be there in a minute!

12:17.919 --> 12:19.419
How many kids do you have?

12:19.420 --> 12:23.356
Oh, two. My little angels. You?

12:23.358 --> 12:25.526
No. No kids for me.

12:33.233 --> 12:35.471
Thank you.

12:36.471 --> 12:37.408
Okay.

12:40.208 --> 12:41.842
To Claire.

12:41.843 --> 12:43.275
May you and David.

12:43.276 --> 12:48.151
Have a happy, healthy,
wonderful marriage.

12:50.151 --> 12:51.256
Cheers!

12:55.256 --> 12:56.556
Thanks, you guys.

12:56.557 --> 12:58.290
You're gonna make me cry.

12:58.291 --> 12:59.559
How about we do gifts?

12:59.560 --> 13:02.394
Yes. Gifts. Gifts. Gifts.
Mine first.

13:02.396 --> 13:04.164
Okay.

13:04.165 --> 13:07.438
I just hope you don't
already have one.

13:10.438 --> 13:12.238
Oh, pretty.

13:12.239 --> 13:13.506
Isn't it beautiful?

13:13.507 --> 13:15.342
I am not wearing this.

13:15.343 --> 13:17.443
You have to.
It's your bachelorette party.

13:17.444 --> 13:22.049
That, and you have to keep it
on all night.

13:22.050 --> 13:25.923
For the piece de resistance...

13:28.923 --> 13:31.957
Oh, it's so pretty, Claire.

13:31.958 --> 13:34.594
- Oh, Claire, it got so pretty.
- You look hot.

13:34.595 --> 13:37.968
Okay, let's just go already.
We're gonna be late.

13:53.915 --> 13:56.550
Fire. Fire.
Your hair's on fire.

14:13.034 --> 14:14.409
Cab should be here in a minute.

14:21.409 --> 14:23.977
Look at my hair.

14:23.978 --> 14:27.915
I'm getting married
in seven days.

14:36.357 --> 14:38.625
We're going to Caesar's palace.

14:38.626 --> 14:40.025
It's Dave.

14:40.027 --> 14:41.694
No, let's go already.

14:41.695 --> 14:45.399
Hey, honey. You won't believe
what just happened to me.

14:45.400 --> 14:49.468
Hello? Hello?

14:49.469 --> 14:51.605
He butt dialed me.

14:51.606 --> 14:54.073
Dave.

14:54.074 --> 14:56.276
He can't hear me at all.

14:58.412 --> 15:01.683
Dave. Dave.

15:03.450 --> 15:05.553
<i>Get on all fours, bachelor boy.</i>

15:06.688 --> 15:08.387
Oh, shit.

15:08.388 --> 15:09.523
Dave.

15:09.524 --> 15:11.591
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Dave!</i>

15:17.098 --> 15:19.698
I don't think she's okay.

15:19.700 --> 15:22.568
Okay, if we don't hurry up,
we're gonna miss Celine Dion.

15:22.569 --> 15:25.007
Fuck Celine Dion.

15:26.007 --> 15:28.041
It's on now.

15:33.714 --> 15:35.515
<i>♪ Dj, play my shit again ♪</i>

15:35.516 --> 15:37.284
<i>♪ take me off your speakerphone ♪</i>

15:37.285 --> 15:39.251
<i>♪ I just wanna freakin' bone ♪</i>

15:39.252 --> 15:41.020
<i>♪ party all night,

15:41.021 --> 15:43.296
<i>♪ fuck it,
let's go back in time ♪</i>

15:49.296 --> 15:54.039
You guys are so hot you're making my
g-string feel like a slip n' slide.

15:58.039 --> 15:59.539
You can't film in here.

15:59.540 --> 16:02.274
It's totally hidden in my purse.

16:02.275 --> 16:04.347
You can't even tell
it's a camera.

16:06.347 --> 16:11.487
So, do you think that just hearing
what happened made you?...

16:12.487 --> 16:17.357
And was Dave getting spanked,
or was Dave doing the spanking?

16:17.358 --> 16:19.525
What do you think?

16:19.526 --> 16:21.193
Mas Tequila!

16:21.194 --> 16:23.630
And you do know that strippers
are just a gateway to hookers?

16:23.631 --> 16:24.765
Seriously.

16:24.766 --> 16:26.366
Shut up. Shut the fuck up.

16:26.367 --> 16:27.501
I'm just saying.

16:27.502 --> 16:31.038
I mean, you were dating Randy
Rosenberg for three years...

16:31.039 --> 16:32.539
and he totally cheated on you.

16:32.540 --> 16:34.306
Really? Randy Rosenberg?

16:34.307 --> 16:35.641
You're going to go there?

16:35.642 --> 16:38.612
Wow, thank you so much
for being a bitch.

16:38.613 --> 16:39.746
Ooh, harsh.

16:39.747 --> 16:43.382
Dave's not Randy Rosenberg.

16:43.383 --> 16:45.385
Hey! Hey!

16:45.386 --> 16:47.453
My best friend's getting
married next week.

16:47.454 --> 16:48.554
Zoe, no.

16:48.555 --> 16:50.524
How much for the vip room?

16:50.525 --> 16:52.291
- No.
- Yeah!

16:52.292 --> 16:53.794
How are you doing, Claire?

16:53.795 --> 16:56.530
Tell the camera.

16:56.531 --> 16:58.832
I feel uncomfortable.

16:58.833 --> 17:00.400
I really don't want a lap dance.

17:00.401 --> 17:02.803
It will even the score, you know?

17:02.804 --> 17:04.738
Tit for tat.

17:04.739 --> 17:07.374
Or tit for dick.

17:07.375 --> 17:12.678
And we just spent 200 bucks.
I wanna see some of this!

17:12.679 --> 17:14.414
Whoa!

17:14.415 --> 17:16.648
Yeah, yeah, make it rain.
Make it rain.

17:16.650 --> 17:20.386
Make it rain!

17:20.387 --> 17:23.394
One lap dance and we're out.
I promise.

17:26.394 --> 17:28.831
It's a charbroiled dodger dog.

17:30.831 --> 17:33.770
No way. He's doing the bow tie.

17:35.770 --> 17:37.671
The unicorn.

17:37.672 --> 17:41.174
I've only heard about
this in chat rooms.

17:41.175 --> 17:43.476
It's in my eye.

17:43.477 --> 17:46.113
Oh! Whoa, whoa.

17:46.114 --> 17:48.121
That's it, you're in trouble.

17:54.121 --> 17:55.355
What just happened?

17:55.356 --> 17:57.865
Beats me. Our time's not up.

18:03.865 --> 18:05.664
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

18:05.665 --> 18:06.664
I don't know.

18:06.665 --> 18:07.901
Did you touch Marcus?

18:07.902 --> 18:09.603
I don't know.

18:09.604 --> 18:10.703
Is he Marcus?

18:10.704 --> 18:12.239
Yeah, she touched me down there.

18:12.240 --> 18:15.474
No, I didn't "touch" him.

18:15.475 --> 18:17.176
Yes, she did.

18:17.177 --> 18:21.248
Your thing,
which is really substantial...

18:21.249 --> 18:23.215
was in my face, so I moved it.

18:23.216 --> 18:25.285
- Ma'am.
- He was putting his thing all over me.

18:25.286 --> 18:26.819
He gave her a unicorn.

18:26.820 --> 18:28.521
I'm allowed to touch you...

18:28.522 --> 18:30.689
but you're not allowed
to touch me.

18:30.690 --> 18:32.725
That's the rules.

18:32.726 --> 18:34.161
I didn't know the rules.

18:34.162 --> 18:36.229
Nobody told me.

18:36.230 --> 18:39.232
They're posted everywhere.

18:39.233 --> 18:42.836
Well, I didn't know.

18:42.837 --> 18:44.303
Sorry.

18:44.304 --> 18:46.675
You essentially raped me.

18:47.675 --> 18:48.942
Oh, come on.

18:48.943 --> 18:51.590
You had your big black dick
in my face.

19:03.590 --> 19:05.925
I can't believe we got kicked
out of a strip club.

19:05.926 --> 19:08.528
I know, right?

19:08.529 --> 19:10.763
- Where to next?
- Here, hold this.

19:10.764 --> 19:14.271
It's not even midnight, and
it's your bachelorette party.

19:17.270 --> 19:18.504
Where are you going?

19:18.505 --> 19:20.775
Just wait there.

19:21.775 --> 19:23.812
What did she say?

19:25.812 --> 19:27.818
I don't know.

19:31.819 --> 19:35.329
It's been, like, 20 minutes,
and Zoe hasn't come back.

19:42.329 --> 19:43.829
Where are you going?

19:43.830 --> 19:46.473
To find her.

19:53.473 --> 19:56.242
Wait up.

19:56.243 --> 19:58.414
I'm coming, too.

20:00.414 --> 20:02.616
Where did she go?

20:02.617 --> 20:05.452
Zoe.

20:05.453 --> 20:06.886
Zoe?

20:06.887 --> 20:09.722
Zoe. Zoe.

20:09.723 --> 20:11.758
Shh.

20:11.759 --> 20:15.028
Zoe, what's going on?

20:15.029 --> 20:18.732
Hey. You got the money?

20:18.733 --> 20:21.501
Here it is. $300.

20:21.502 --> 20:22.668
I'm getting us some coke.

20:22.669 --> 20:23.969
Oh, come on, seriously?

20:23.970 --> 20:25.905
I'll try coke.

20:25.906 --> 20:27.840
You guys,
I need a pick-me-up.

20:27.841 --> 20:30.476
We do a little bit of blow,
we party our asses off.

20:30.477 --> 20:32.745
You know, we need to switch up
the vibe a little bit.

20:32.746 --> 20:35.914
You got our stuff?
The money's all there.

20:35.915 --> 20:38.417
No, I'm gonna need everything.

20:38.418 --> 20:40.856
That is everything.

20:43.758 --> 20:44.658
Don't shoot us.

20:44.991 --> 20:46.760
Shit.

20:46.761 --> 20:49.495
Just don't look at his face.
Then he won't have to kill us.

20:49.496 --> 20:51.931
We had a deal...
$300 for an eight ball.

20:51.932 --> 20:54.067
Hey, bitch, I ain't no dealer.

20:54.068 --> 20:56.635
I thought valet Parkers
had all the connections.

20:56.636 --> 20:59.472
Come on. Just give me all your jewelry.
Come on.

20:59.473 --> 21:01.412
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Come on!

21:04.412 --> 21:05.912
Yeah, I want the ring, too.

21:05.913 --> 21:08.347
Gimme the ring.

21:08.348 --> 21:09.782
I'll take the ring, too.

21:09.783 --> 21:11.686
Okay.

21:12.686 --> 21:15.056
Thank you.

21:18.059 --> 21:21.060
Are those Christian Louboutins?

21:21.061 --> 21:24.530
You're wearing a red vest,
but you know Louboutins?

21:24.531 --> 21:28.367
Don't!
Don't sass me!

21:28.368 --> 21:30.837
What size are those?

21:30.838 --> 21:32.739
Hm? What size are those?

21:32.740 --> 21:35.039
Eight and a half.

21:35.040 --> 21:36.608
Eight and a half.
Eight and a half.

21:36.609 --> 21:39.445
All right, I'll take them.

21:39.446 --> 21:41.715
My lady's gonna give it up
to me tonight.

21:42.716 --> 21:43.949
Lucky her.

21:43.950 --> 21:45.659
Oh, and the purses.

21:52.659 --> 21:55.127
I'll take that purse, too.

21:55.128 --> 21:56.495
Stay put!

21:56.496 --> 21:58.431
Hey, give it back.

21:58.432 --> 22:00.703
Leslie, let him have it!

22:02.703 --> 22:03.970
Give it back.

22:10.644 --> 22:14.047
Leslie!

22:14.048 --> 22:15.482
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

22:15.483 --> 22:16.783
Are you shot?

22:21.821 --> 22:23.522
No.

22:23.523 --> 22:26.826
I tackled him
and the gun went off...

22:26.827 --> 22:29.428
and it just scared him,
and he took off.

22:29.429 --> 22:31.130
Oh, my God.

22:31.131 --> 22:34.434
Leslie, why did you chase him?

22:34.435 --> 22:36.734
I don't know.

22:36.736 --> 22:41.107
I think some rage just kicked in.

22:41.108 --> 22:44.611
You're like the incredible hulk.
That's what it is.

22:45.980 --> 22:47.981
Thank God, the cops.

22:47.982 --> 22:49.482
We gotta go.

22:49.483 --> 22:50.716
Why?
We'll make a report.

22:50.717 --> 22:53.121
I have a warrant out
for my arrest.

22:55.121 --> 22:56.689
Awesome!

22:56.690 --> 22:59.893
For what?

22:59.894 --> 23:01.933
The purse!

23:05.932 --> 23:08.201
Bobby broke up with me,
so I slashed his tires.

23:08.202 --> 23:09.769
And keyed my name into his car.

23:09.770 --> 23:11.905
I was supposed to go
to court two weeks ago.

23:11.906 --> 23:13.972
Zoe!

23:13.973 --> 23:16.614
Claire, honestly, I don't have time
to hear a lecture from you now.

23:22.049 --> 23:22.989
Jump. Get in.

23:38.131 --> 23:41.501
Oh.

23:41.502 --> 23:42.701
God, what's that smell?

23:42.703 --> 23:44.937
We're in a dumpster.

23:44.938 --> 23:50.242
I know, but it's like
rotten fish.

23:50.243 --> 23:53.178
We just passed a seafood buffet.

23:53.179 --> 23:54.747
All you can eat for $2.99.

23:54.748 --> 23:56.950
We should hit that after.

23:56.951 --> 24:01.554
Shh, shh.
They're right out there.

24:03.290 --> 24:09.229
<i>Delta 1-5-6-6, give me a call
on your primary 5-5-7-4.</i>

24:09.230 --> 24:10.935
Checking the alley.

24:46.133 --> 24:47.812
Shh, shh, shh.

25:00.813 --> 25:02.882
Shh...

25:02.883 --> 25:06.219
I can't breathe.
I gotta get outta here.

25:06.220 --> 25:08.555
Really? Relax.

25:08.556 --> 25:09.755
I can't breathe.

25:09.756 --> 25:11.023
She's hyperventilating.

25:11.024 --> 25:13.026
You're just having
a panic attack.

25:13.027 --> 25:14.766
You have to calm down.

25:19.767 --> 25:20.938

You are such a fuck up.

28:45.239 --> 28:47.352
But I love you.

28:59.351 --> 29:00.953
So, what are we gonna do now?

29:00.954 --> 29:03.060
We go home, back to L.A.

29:08.060 --> 29:09.862
How?

29:09.863 --> 29:11.530
Yeah, we're flat broke.

29:11.531 --> 29:15.269
And we need at least a couple
hundred bucks just for gas.

29:16.269 --> 29:18.436
We can't have anyone
wire us the money.

29:18.437 --> 29:22.374
Because we don't have ID's
to prove who we are.

29:22.376 --> 29:28.084
And I'd have Larry drive here
and bail us out, but...

29:31.084 --> 29:33.290
He doesn't know I'm in Vegas.

29:36.289 --> 29:37.426
Can Greg help us?

29:40.426 --> 29:42.027
Probably not.

29:42.029 --> 29:43.128
Why?

29:43.129 --> 29:45.865
You know how when you Google
something on the computer...

29:45.866 --> 29:48.568
the last word you wrote
will pop up?

29:48.569 --> 29:53.572
I typed in the letter "M"
for Martha's vineyard.

29:53.573 --> 29:55.875
I was gonna book a vacation.

29:55.876 --> 29:57.910
For our seven year anniversary.

29:57.911 --> 30:00.178
Anyway, I typed
in the letter the "M"...

30:00.179 --> 30:04.985
and the site "Manstalk. La"
suddenly appeared.

30:05.985 --> 30:08.119
Oh, no.

30:08.120 --> 30:11.389
What's Manstalk. La?

30:11.390 --> 30:14.393
Greg's password
was still entered.

30:14.394 --> 30:18.364
That's when I saw it.

30:18.365 --> 30:24.336
That is the worse thing
I could ever imagine.

30:24.337 --> 30:27.472
Which one's you husband?

30:27.473 --> 30:29.508
The one in the middle.

30:29.509 --> 30:31.911
The irony is palpable.

30:31.912 --> 30:35.213
What?

30:35.214 --> 30:37.918
Well, there's the eiffel tower...

30:38.918 --> 30:41.895
And they're giving him
the eiffel tower.

30:50.963 --> 30:53.299
So, did you talk to him about it?

30:53.300 --> 30:57.573
He filed for legal separation
the morning we left for Vegas.

31:00.573 --> 31:05.813
And evidently he cancelled
all my credit cards.

31:06.914 --> 31:10.683
Leslie, I'm so sorry.

31:10.684 --> 31:15.520
I don't know what to say.

31:15.521 --> 31:17.490
Thanks.

31:17.491 --> 31:19.023
It's hard to talk about.

31:19.024 --> 31:20.659
Well, we have it all on tape.

31:20.660 --> 31:26.499
If you ever want
to watch it back.

31:26.500 --> 31:29.705
That's fucking awesome.

31:32.705 --> 31:34.507
So what do we do?

31:34.508 --> 31:37.410
It's the middle of the night,
and we're stuck in Vegas.

31:37.411 --> 31:40.550
If we don't get some cash,
we're never going to get home.

31:44.550 --> 31:47.255
Uh, I've got an idea.

32:09.675 --> 32:11.309
No way.

32:11.310 --> 32:12.344
This is nuts.

32:12.345 --> 32:14.613
I've always wanted to do this.

32:14.614 --> 32:16.214
Seriously?

32:16.215 --> 32:18.550
It combines
my two favorite passions...

32:18.551 --> 32:21.720
wrestling and gelatin.

32:21.722 --> 32:24.456
And we need the money.
Bad.

32:24.457 --> 32:26.062
This is gonna be great.

32:30.062 --> 32:33.499
Janet, you don't have to do this.

32:33.500 --> 32:35.067
I can win.

32:35.068 --> 32:36.100
Are you just saying that...

32:36.102 --> 32:37.435
or do you actually believe that?

32:37.436 --> 32:39.607
I can win.

32:40.607 --> 32:42.174
Winner!

32:42.175 --> 32:44.375
All right, ladies, who's up next?

32:44.376 --> 32:46.377
Now remember.
It's amateur night.

32:46.378 --> 32:48.180
So any one of you.

32:48.181 --> 32:51.349
Who thinks you can pin the
reigning champ, Veronica...

32:51.350 --> 32:54.087
Will win $500.

32:56.188 --> 32:58.057
I'll do it.
I'll wrestle her.

32:58.058 --> 32:59.625
Looks like we got a taker.

32:59.626 --> 33:00.760
Why don't you come on down.

33:00.761 --> 33:02.101
And sign these release forms?

33:10.102 --> 33:11.479
You gotta love her.

33:19.479 --> 33:21.046
Hi, I'm Trevor.

33:21.048 --> 33:22.080
I'm Rick.

33:22.081 --> 33:23.782
What are you two drinking?

33:23.783 --> 33:26.152
Sex on the beach.

33:26.153 --> 33:28.087
A girl after my own heart.

33:28.088 --> 33:30.321
Nothing for me.

33:30.322 --> 33:34.793
Would you excuse us for a second?

33:34.794 --> 33:36.194
What are you doing?

33:36.195 --> 33:37.629
Those guys are cute.

33:37.630 --> 33:39.597
I can't be your wingman.

33:39.598 --> 33:41.500
You're not married yet.

33:41.501 --> 33:42.768
Zoe, no.

33:42.769 --> 33:45.069
Come on.
For old times sake.

33:45.071 --> 33:46.638
It'll probably be the last time.

33:46.639 --> 33:48.174
You'll ever have a chance.

33:48.175 --> 33:50.708
Of helping me find my true love.

33:50.709 --> 33:52.078
Please?

33:52.079 --> 33:53.445
Look, just say yes.

33:53.446 --> 33:57.849
They are so cute.

33:57.850 --> 34:00.386
Please? Please?

34:00.387 --> 34:01.854
Please? Please?
Please? Please...

34:01.855 --> 34:04.857
Okay, I'll be your wingman.

34:04.858 --> 34:06.157
Everything all right?

34:06.158 --> 34:08.159
Totally. I'm Kim.

34:08.159 --> 34:09.661
And this is...

34:09.661 --> 34:11.429
Antoinette.

34:11.429 --> 34:14.867
Drinks, ladies?

34:14.868 --> 34:18.137
So, antoinette, what do you do?

34:18.138 --> 34:19.637
What brings you to Vegas?

34:19.638 --> 34:23.442
Oh, I'm in the shoe business.

34:23.443 --> 34:26.679
Right. Right, you're here
for the convention.

34:26.679 --> 34:29.681
Yup. Yes. Exactly.

34:29.681 --> 34:32.382
I'm a cobbler.

34:32.384 --> 34:35.621
You're a shoe cobbler, like a...

34:35.621 --> 34:38.324
Yes, I cobble.

34:38.324 --> 34:41.326
Your eyes are following me?
You're cute.

34:41.327 --> 34:42.494
And you?

34:42.495 --> 34:44.529
Nothing as interesting as that.

34:44.530 --> 34:48.300
I'm actually doing my residency
right now at Johns Hopkins.

34:48.301 --> 34:49.567
You're a doctor.

34:49.568 --> 34:50.804
Yeah.

34:51.804 --> 34:53.639
Okay, I'm up next.

34:53.639 --> 34:55.141
Are you gonna wrestle?

34:55.141 --> 34:56.875
Fuck yeah.

34:56.876 --> 35:00.478
It was nice talking with you.

35:00.479 --> 35:03.516
It was nice meeting you,
antoinette.

35:03.517 --> 35:04.617
Antoinette?

35:04.618 --> 35:05.683
Long story.

35:05.684 --> 35:07.485
Are you sure about this?

35:07.486 --> 35:08.721
I'm sure.

35:08.722 --> 35:10.822
You're leaking.

35:10.823 --> 35:14.226
I usually pump and dump
before bed.

35:14.227 --> 35:16.161
And now for our next bout...

35:16.162 --> 35:19.465
weighing in at 129 pounds...

35:19.466 --> 35:22.467
hailing from Simi valley,
California...

35:22.468 --> 35:26.205
ladies and gentlemen,
Janet Simmons.

35:27.908 --> 35:29.776
Wish me luck.

35:36.249 --> 35:38.384
Can you see
my c-section scar?

35:38.385 --> 35:41.856
Uh, no, not at all.

35:42.856 --> 35:44.822
How was that guy?

35:44.823 --> 35:45.958
Fine.

35:45.959 --> 35:47.293
Fine?

35:47.294 --> 35:48.960
He's cute.

35:48.961 --> 35:53.498
And defending her title as
wrestling champion of Las Vegas...

35:53.499 --> 35:55.934
Veronica!

35:55.935 --> 35:58.204
All right, I want a good
clean fight, all right?

35:58.205 --> 35:59.704
Keep it clean, but,
you know, make it dirty.

35:59.705 --> 36:04.693
And remember,
the winner gets $500.

36:20.794 --> 36:22.901
Come on, Janet!

36:27.901 --> 36:29.903
You gonna die tonight.

36:36.675 --> 36:38.309
Jesus Christ.

36:38.310 --> 36:39.945
Is she gonna die?

36:39.946 --> 36:41.947
Janet, are you okay?

36:41.948 --> 36:43.014
Son of a bitch.

36:43.015 --> 36:46.018
Help her, she's bleeding.

36:46.019 --> 36:48.454
I bit my tongue.
I bit my tongue.

36:48.455 --> 36:49.993
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

36:53.993 --> 36:55.460
Did I win?

36:55.461 --> 36:56.962
You got you ass kicked.

36:56.963 --> 36:59.465
I did?

36:59.466 --> 37:01.500
Pretty bad, actually.

37:01.501 --> 37:03.968
At one point, you cried.

37:03.969 --> 37:05.310
Bummer.

37:10.310 --> 37:11.011
I thought I lost.

37:12.011 --> 37:15.980
You did get $300 just for trying.

37:15.981 --> 37:18.851
Whoo! Yes!

37:18.852 --> 37:21.786
Yeah!

37:21.787 --> 37:23.956
Janet, you did it.

37:23.957 --> 37:26.324
Get me out of these. I don't
wanna go to the hospital.

37:26.325 --> 37:27.692
Well, that's
where you're going so...

37:27.693 --> 37:29.395
I'm not bleeding.
I'm okay.

37:29.396 --> 37:30.596
I'm not bleeding.

37:30.597 --> 37:31.497
Pathetic.

37:31.997 --> 37:33.331
Excuse me?

37:33.332 --> 37:34.800
She's too old to be wrestling.

37:34.801 --> 37:38.736
Come on, look at her.

37:38.738 --> 37:39.938
Fuck you.

37:39.939 --> 37:41.507
Leslie, it's okay.

37:41.508 --> 37:42.974
It's not okay.

37:42.975 --> 37:45.043
You apologize.

37:45.044 --> 37:46.844
No.

37:46.845 --> 37:48.480
My friend has more guts
and courage.

37:48.481 --> 37:49.747
Than you could ever know.

37:49.749 --> 37:50.949
You apologize.

37:50.950 --> 37:52.016
Fuck you, you crazy bitch.

37:52.017 --> 37:53.318
Don't touch me.

37:53.319 --> 37:55.820
You apologize.

37:55.821 --> 37:57.825
Don't touch her!

38:01.794 --> 38:03.718
Go!

38:24.718 --> 38:29.121
Where are we?

38:29.122 --> 38:30.039
I don't know.

38:47.039 --> 38:49.907
How are we gonna get back?

38:49.908 --> 38:54.880
There's no taxis.

38:54.881 --> 38:58.117
We'll have to walk.

38:58.118 --> 39:02.154
We should probably take
these pills then.

39:02.155 --> 39:04.021
Where'd you get those?

39:04.022 --> 39:06.958
I swiped them from the ambulance.

39:06.959 --> 39:08.893
What are they?

39:08.894 --> 39:11.596
I have no idea.

39:11.597 --> 39:13.630
I'm not going to take
just some random pill.

39:13.631 --> 39:14.701
It could be anything.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.402
And there's only two.

39:17.403 --> 39:19.538
I took one already.

39:19.539 --> 39:21.673
Are you crazy?

39:25.111 --> 39:26.978
I took one, too.

39:26.979 --> 39:29.047
Leslie.

39:29.048 --> 39:34.920
And I got a whole bottle.

39:34.921 --> 39:36.528
Mm-hm.

39:41.528 --> 39:43.897
What? They're not dead.

39:44.897 --> 39:47.065
Look how happy they are.

39:47.066 --> 39:48.867
Come, Claire.

39:48.868 --> 39:50.133
Stop peer-pressuring me.

39:50.135 --> 39:52.510
This is not high school.

39:58.510 --> 40:00.082
I'm not taking it.

48:15.540 --> 48:19.584

48:25.584 --> 48:28.686
Believe it or not, I don't
have a lot of girlfriends.

48:28.687 --> 48:32.090
- No.
- No, seriously.

48:32.091 --> 48:33.190
My day's packed.

48:33.191 --> 48:35.492
I wake up, feed the twins...

48:35.493 --> 48:38.428
give Larry his morning cup
of coffee and blowjob.

48:38.429 --> 48:41.532
<i>I get home, watch duck dynasty...</i>

48:41.533 --> 48:43.700
have glass of box rosé...

48:43.701 --> 48:46.570
blow Larry again and crash.

48:46.571 --> 48:48.373
You blow your husband
twice a day?

48:48.374 --> 48:53.079
Well, yeah, you have
to reciprocate the cunnilingus.

48:54.180 --> 48:55.646
Yo, full disclosure.

48:55.647 --> 48:59.617
I kinda invited myself to
Claire's bachelorette party.

48:59.618 --> 49:01.084
To make some new friends.

49:01.085 --> 49:03.321
- Aw.
- Aw.

49:04.490 --> 49:09.028
Eat my ass and learn
how to fucking drive!

49:14.066 --> 49:15.732
Oh, my God.

49:15.733 --> 49:17.568
I need to get laid.

49:17.569 --> 49:18.770
Dude.

49:18.771 --> 49:20.505
No.

49:20.506 --> 49:23.708
No, I need to get back in the
saddle and get over my marriage.

49:23.709 --> 49:25.343
You go, girl.

49:27.479 --> 49:29.413
I need a guy like Larry.

49:29.414 --> 49:31.782
Yeah.

49:31.783 --> 49:33.153
Yeah.

49:35.153 --> 49:36.454
I want my ring back.

49:36.455 --> 49:38.756
Sorry, honey.
That's not gonna happen.

49:38.758 --> 49:41.291
The guy's long gone,
and so is your ring.

49:41.292 --> 49:43.527
No, that's the guy
that robbed us.

49:43.528 --> 49:45.763
I want my ring back.

49:45.765 --> 49:47.803
Oh, my God.
Is that him?

49:50.803 --> 49:52.672
It looks like him.

49:55.673 --> 49:58.408
It's fucking him, all right.

49:58.409 --> 50:02.779
He had a gun to my face, and I
looked at him dead in the eye.

50:02.781 --> 50:05.250
Claire's right.
It is him.

50:05.251 --> 50:08.051
I'm not getting married
without my ring.

50:08.052 --> 50:10.524
Well, what do we do?

50:12.524 --> 50:15.796
It's because of me
your ring got taken.

50:17.796 --> 50:20.537
So I'm gonna get your ring back.

50:24.537 --> 50:26.307
Did you get everything?

50:30.176 --> 50:31.441
- Oh.
- Oh.

50:31.443 --> 50:36.313
Oh, cool.

50:36.314 --> 50:37.614
Where'd you get all this stuff?

50:37.615 --> 50:39.082
The mini-mart.

50:39.083 --> 50:40.552
They had everything.

50:40.553 --> 50:42.686
They sell stun guns
at the mini-mart?

50:42.687 --> 50:43.822
They do in Vegas.

50:43.823 --> 50:45.824
What is this for?

50:45.825 --> 50:47.722
It's to conceal our identities.

50:47.723 --> 50:49.135
In case anyone sees us.

50:56.135 --> 50:58.368
It's to cover your face.

50:58.369 --> 51:01.338
Here.

51:01.339 --> 51:02.345
Oh.

51:07.345 --> 51:09.854
Here.

51:14.854 --> 51:15.887
How do I look?

51:15.888 --> 51:18.155
Pretty cool actually.

51:18.156 --> 51:19.756
The green brings out your eyes.

51:19.757 --> 51:23.494
Thanks, Janet.

51:23.495 --> 51:25.195
Hey.
This yellow's mine.

51:25.196 --> 51:26.663
Are you crazy?

51:26.664 --> 51:29.266
With your pale complexion,
you should wear orange.

51:29.267 --> 51:32.170
It doesn't matter.

51:32.171 --> 51:35.404
Here, take that.

51:35.405 --> 51:37.809
Great, so you're taking yellow?

51:37.810 --> 51:39.744
Leslie.

51:39.745 --> 51:41.214
Does everyone know the plan?

51:43.214 --> 51:45.519

Get his gun, Janet.

52:06.372 --> 52:10.175
It's not here. No gun. No gun.

52:10.176 --> 52:11.775
Get off me.
Get off me.

52:11.776 --> 52:13.745

52:20.185 --> 52:22.520

52:22.521 --> 52:23.621
I want my ring!

52:23.622 --> 52:25.455
I'm not getting married

52:25.457 --> 52:27.229
I don't have your ring.

52:33.798 --> 52:35.433
Damn, Claire.

52:35.434 --> 52:37.534
You messed with the wrong girls.

52:37.535 --> 52:39.743
Check his pockets.

52:45.742 --> 52:47.978
There's over $500 here.

52:47.979 --> 52:50.248
That's our money.

52:50.249 --> 52:51.287
Anything else?

52:56.287 --> 52:59.924
I'm sorry, Claire.
Your ring's not here.

52:59.925 --> 53:03.427
Maybe he pawned it or something.

53:03.428 --> 53:07.831
Or maybe it's at his house
with the rest of our shit.

53:07.832 --> 53:08.933
Driver?

53:08.934 --> 53:09.934
Yeah?

53:09.935 --> 53:12.971
Take us to 972 Filbanks Avenue.

53:12.972 --> 53:14.338
Where the hell is that?

53:14.339 --> 53:16.709
I'll map it.

53:17.709 --> 53:19.911
Do you guys think maybe we
should just ditch him.

53:19.912 --> 53:22.986
And the stolen limo
and get out while we still can?

53:26.986 --> 53:28.890
No?

53:35.827 --> 53:36.893
That's the house.

53:36.894 --> 53:40.931
Gimme the keys.
I'm going in.

53:40.932 --> 53:42.500
What if someone else is there?

53:42.501 --> 53:44.668
I'll knock on the door,
and if someone answers...

53:44.669 --> 53:45.837
I'll say I'm looking for...

53:45.838 --> 53:48.713
- Charlie.
- Charlie.

53:54.712 --> 53:57.748
Are we even sure this is
the guy that robbed us?

53:57.749 --> 53:59.284
What do you mean?

53:59.285 --> 54:01.987
This guy is wearing a tie.

54:02.988 --> 54:04.822
So?

54:04.823 --> 54:07.324
I distinctly remember
the guy who robbed us.

54:07.325 --> 54:09.427
Was not wearing a tie.

54:09.428 --> 54:11.997
Obviously, he put on a tie.

54:12.997 --> 54:15.833
I checked the house, but no ring.

54:15.834 --> 54:16.854
But I found these.

54:17.001 --> 54:18.703
My Christian Louboutins.

54:18.704 --> 54:20.871
It is him.

54:20.872 --> 54:22.974
You asshole.

54:22.975 --> 54:24.510
Oh.

54:25.510 --> 54:26.811
When he comes to...

54:26.812 --> 54:28.950
we'll find out
where your ring is.

54:38.656 --> 54:40.558
Leslie?

54:40.559 --> 54:42.830
I don't know
if it's all the pills...

54:45.830 --> 54:49.666
or the whole, you know,
home-invasion thing.

54:49.667 --> 54:51.802
It's just a little stressful.

54:51.803 --> 54:53.502
This is really good weed.

54:53.504 --> 54:54.806
How do you know?

54:54.807 --> 54:55.840
I'm a daily toker.

54:55.841 --> 54:56.873
You are?

54:56.874 --> 54:58.512
I wake and bake.

55:00.512 --> 55:02.746
Otherwise, I'm really uptight.

55:02.747 --> 55:04.681
Let's teach Charlie here
a lesson.

55:04.682 --> 55:07.085
He victimized us...

55:07.086 --> 55:09.557
and now it's time
for a little payback.

55:11.557 --> 55:12.717
What are you gonna do, Janet?

55:21.566 --> 55:24.469
Big deal,
you shaved off an eyebrow.

55:24.470 --> 55:26.404
- No good?
- Not for what he did to us.

55:26.405 --> 55:27.838
Yeah, you're right.

55:27.839 --> 55:29.773
That was bullshit.

55:29.774 --> 55:32.944
That was just me getting
warmed up.

55:36.647 --> 55:37.983
<i>In girl with the dragon tattoo...</i>

55:38.984 --> 55:42.085
Lisbeth was raped
by this pig, this asshole...

55:42.086 --> 55:46.491
so she tied him up
and tattooed his chest...

55:46.492 --> 55:47.431
"I'm a rapist pig"...

55:47.993 --> 55:49.159
Or something like that.

55:49.160 --> 55:50.169
I don't remember exactly.

55:57.169 --> 55:59.436
Janet, what are you writing?

55:59.437 --> 56:02.974
Gimme his phone.

56:02.975 --> 56:04.809
I'm gonna take a picture.

56:04.810 --> 56:09.479
And send it to every one
of his contacts.

56:09.481 --> 56:11.849
Yes, and now every one of
Charlie's Facebook friends.

56:11.850 --> 56:14.854
Know that he's
a "rapping pig."

56:18.490 --> 56:20.157
Raping pig.

56:20.158 --> 56:23.494
Yeah, but you spelled it,
"rapping."

56:23.495 --> 56:25.164
And he robbed us altogether.

56:26.432 --> 56:27.432
Fuck.

56:27.665 --> 56:30.168
We have to humiliate
this piece of shit.

56:30.169 --> 56:31.668
Once and for all...

56:31.669 --> 56:35.206
so forever he is punished
for what he did to us.

56:35.207 --> 56:36.706
Whoa, Janet, what are you doing?

56:36.707 --> 56:38.675
I'm going to piss in his face.

56:38.676 --> 56:39.844
- No.
- Don't do it.

56:39.845 --> 56:42.511
That's even too hardcore for me.

56:42.513 --> 56:43.947
Whizz away, girlfriend.

56:43.948 --> 56:45.081
Whizz away.

56:45.082 --> 56:46.184
Janet, don't.

56:46.185 --> 56:47.818
That's so gross.
No.

56:47.819 --> 56:50.595
I'm gonna defile him
the same way he defiled us.

56:56.595 --> 56:59.197
They're tight.
Why are they so tight?

56:59.198 --> 57:04.835
They don't fit anymore.

57:04.836 --> 57:06.069
He's coming to.

57:06.070 --> 57:07.637
Ask him where your ring is.

57:07.638 --> 57:08.704
Where's my ring?

57:08.705 --> 57:10.074
Tell me where my ring is.

57:11.542 --> 57:13.643
These are size seven.

57:13.644 --> 57:14.810
These are size seven.

57:14.811 --> 57:15.812
So?

57:15.814 --> 57:18.516
Mine's an eight and a half.

57:18.517 --> 57:19.784
These aren't my shoes.

57:19.785 --> 57:22.553
That's not the valet
that robbed us.

57:24.689 --> 57:26.791
That's not the valet
who robbed us.

57:26.792 --> 57:30.093
Hey! What the hell
are you doing to our son?

57:30.094 --> 57:30.996
Oh, God.

57:31.997 --> 57:33.265
Oh, my...

57:34.265 --> 57:36.132
Oh, shit.

57:36.133 --> 57:37.668
Suzie, get the shotgun.

57:37.669 --> 57:39.270
Don't do it, Suzie.

57:39.271 --> 57:40.971
You move one inch...

57:40.972 --> 57:44.107
and my friend here will put 300
thousand volts of electricity.

57:44.109 --> 57:46.244
Into your son's nut sack.

57:46.245 --> 57:48.584
You want grandkids, don't you?

57:52.584 --> 57:53.684
Dead battery.

57:53.685 --> 57:56.723
Come on, get the gun.
Goddamn it!

57:58.723 --> 58:00.265
Go, go, go, go...

58:06.265 --> 58:07.864
Let's roll.

58:07.865 --> 58:09.567
You went through the whole house.

58:09.568 --> 58:10.934
And you didn't
see his parents there?

58:10.935 --> 58:13.136
It was dark and I'm hammered.

58:13.138 --> 58:15.572
You pooped
on an innocent man's face.

58:15.573 --> 58:18.175
I have a nervous stomach.
I'm not proud of it.

58:18.176 --> 58:21.579
And we electrocuted him
and we stole all his money.

58:21.580 --> 58:23.813
We have his address.
We'll reimburse him.

58:23.814 --> 58:28.886
We'll send him
a "get well soon" card.

58:28.887 --> 58:32.693
I'm sorry, Claire,
we didn't get your ring back.

58:35.693 --> 58:38.697
I think it's time that we
ditch the stolen vehicle.

58:40.698 --> 58:43.613
And definitely take more pills.

58:54.613 --> 58:56.200
Nope.

59:15.200 --> 59:17.168
Which one's our room?

59:17.169 --> 59:19.804
Fuck, I don't know.

59:19.805 --> 59:21.042
They all look the same.

59:24.042 --> 59:26.144
I'm so wasted.

59:34.151 --> 59:37.154
Hey, who ordered more girls?

59:37.155 --> 59:40.064
What the... what the hell?

59:47.064 --> 59:48.065
Come on in.

59:48.066 --> 59:50.701
What's a bachelor party
without a little talent?

59:50.702 --> 59:53.237
No, Claire, let's just go.

59:53.238 --> 59:54.374
No.

59:56.374 --> 59:57.942
Where's the bachelor?

59:57.943 --> 59:59.902
Mike! Mike! Mike!
Mike! Mike...

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.849
No. No.

01:00:04.850 --> 01:00:07.217
Who are these chicks?

01:00:07.218 --> 01:00:09.119
You're getting married.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:10.990
Married tomorrow,
but single tonight.

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.762
How do you think your fiance
would feel.

01:00:17.763 --> 01:00:19.133
If she knew what you're doing?

01:00:21.133 --> 01:00:22.166
Is that a camera?

01:00:22.167 --> 01:00:23.300
- No.
- No.

01:00:23.301 --> 01:00:24.433
Yeah, it is.

01:00:24.434 --> 01:00:26.837
You've got a fucking camera.

01:00:26.838 --> 01:00:27.918
You been filming this?

01:00:28.006 --> 01:00:30.073
Leave her alone, you raisin dick.

01:00:30.074 --> 01:00:33.075
Give that to me.

01:00:33.076 --> 01:00:35.146
Claire. Get your
fucking hands off her.

01:00:35.147 --> 01:00:36.947
Oh, yeah?

01:00:36.948 --> 01:00:39.916
Rick?

01:00:39.917 --> 01:00:41.999
Get out.
Come on. Out. Out.

01:00:53.999 --> 01:00:54.799
Oh, God.

01:00:54.899 --> 01:00:56.800
We gonna hook up or what?

01:00:56.801 --> 01:00:58.168
What happened to Claire?

01:00:58.169 --> 01:00:59.302
Where's Claire?

01:00:59.303 --> 01:01:00.736
I don't know.

01:01:00.737 --> 01:01:02.709
I think she ran off
with that guy.

01:01:04.709 --> 01:01:06.109
Claire!

01:01:06.111 --> 01:01:07.244
What's up?

01:01:07.245 --> 01:01:09.111
I'm looking for Claire.

01:01:09.112 --> 01:01:11.014
Claire!

01:01:11.015 --> 01:01:12.184
Claire.

01:01:17.021 --> 01:01:18.355
She's driving off with that guy.

01:01:18.356 --> 01:01:19.924
We have to go after her.

01:01:19.925 --> 01:01:21.291
Hey, don't cock block.

01:01:21.292 --> 01:01:22.758
She's a big girl.

01:01:22.759 --> 01:01:24.127
Yeah, but she's drunk.

01:01:24.129 --> 01:01:25.795
And I don't want her
doing something.

01:01:25.796 --> 01:01:30.101
That she's going to regret.

01:01:30.102 --> 01:01:31.175
Let's go.

01:01:37.075 --> 01:01:39.043
I can't believe you had
those guys come over.

01:01:39.044 --> 01:01:39.844
Why not?

01:01:40.011 --> 01:01:42.145
Because Claire's getting
married next Saturday.

01:01:42.147 --> 01:01:44.120
She was my wingman.

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:53.023
Okay. Sorry.

01:01:53.024 --> 01:01:56.866
Okay, so I'll just wait here then?

01:02:01.867 --> 01:02:04.472
Hurry, start the car up.

01:02:07.472 --> 01:02:08.538
Let's go. There.

01:02:08.539 --> 01:02:09.780
Take a left.

01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:17.854
Come on, we can catch up, go.

01:02:22.854 --> 01:02:23.954
There. There.

01:02:23.955 --> 01:02:25.861
Catch up. Come on.

01:02:34.165 --> 01:02:37.835
Quick, they're getting away.

01:02:37.836 --> 01:02:40.102
Go, Janet, go.

01:02:40.103 --> 01:02:41.837
Hurry.
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:02:41.839 --> 01:02:43.974
Hurry. Go!

01:02:43.975 --> 01:02:45.376
Put your foot on it!
Go.

01:03:08.133 --> 01:03:10.201
You okay?
Are you okay?

01:03:10.202 --> 01:03:14.103
I'm fine.

01:03:14.104 --> 01:03:18.942
And there's no real damage
here, so it's cool.

01:03:18.943 --> 01:03:20.911
No real damage?

01:03:20.912 --> 01:03:23.112
You guys all right?

01:03:23.113 --> 01:03:24.280
Yeah.

01:03:24.281 --> 01:03:26.049
What happened?

01:03:26.050 --> 01:03:27.585
Where are you going?

01:03:27.586 --> 01:03:29.330
Hey. Get back here.

01:03:38.330 --> 01:03:40.068
Shit, there's no sign of them.

01:03:43.067 --> 01:03:44.400
Wait, is that them?

01:03:44.401 --> 01:03:48.905
That's them.
That's them.

01:03:48.906 --> 01:03:50.379
Make a right.
Make a right.

01:03:54.379 --> 01:03:56.457
They're going
in the parking garage.

01:04:05.457 --> 01:04:07.638
Here. Here.
Park. Park.

01:04:20.638 --> 01:04:22.505

Fifth floor.

01:04:32.117 --> 01:04:33.286
Okay.

01:04:35.287 --> 01:04:36.253
Follow me.

01:04:36.254 --> 01:04:38.126
Hurry, Zoe, hurry.

01:04:42.125 --> 01:04:43.326
Hurry.

01:04:43.327 --> 01:04:44.664
Fifth floor.

01:04:47.665 --> 01:04:49.001
There she is.

01:04:51.001 --> 01:04:53.136
- Claire.
- Claire.

01:04:53.138 --> 01:04:54.412
Claire.

01:05:00.411 --> 01:05:01.545
They're in there.

01:05:01.546 --> 01:05:03.149
I can see them.

01:05:05.148 --> 01:05:10.687
Shit. Don't do it, Claire.

01:05:10.688 --> 01:05:12.394
They turned out the lights.

01:05:16.394 --> 01:05:17.494
Open up.

01:05:17.495 --> 01:05:18.530
Go away.

01:05:21.031 --> 01:05:23.472
Open up now!

01:05:28.472 --> 01:05:30.174
Hey!

01:05:30.175 --> 01:05:33.110
Claire, you're making
a big mistake!

01:05:33.111 --> 01:05:36.679
Goddamn it,
I was just about to come.

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:38.114
Oh, man.

01:05:38.115 --> 01:05:39.183
Who the hell are you?

01:05:39.184 --> 01:05:41.518
Uh, housekeeping.

01:05:41.519 --> 01:05:42.620
Wrong room.

01:05:55.733 --> 01:05:57.668
Which room did she go in?

01:05:57.669 --> 01:05:59.703
I'm not sure.

01:05:59.704 --> 01:06:00.737
Zoe, don't!

01:06:11.249 --> 01:06:13.183
What are you doing here?

01:06:13.184 --> 01:06:14.518
You dirty little slut.

01:06:14.519 --> 01:06:16.219
What?

01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:18.521
I didn't do anything.

01:06:18.522 --> 01:06:22.758
I mean, it's not like he
didn't try, but I love Dave.

01:06:22.759 --> 01:06:25.096
And I'm getting married.

01:06:26.097 --> 01:06:28.232
Shouldn't we be evacuating?

01:06:28.233 --> 01:06:30.133
There's no fire.

01:06:30.135 --> 01:06:32.101
There's no fire.

01:06:32.102 --> 01:06:33.640
- It was Zoe.
- You!

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:37.241
Come back here.

01:06:37.242 --> 01:06:38.541
I think we should go.

01:06:38.542 --> 01:06:40.610
Hey, come back here!

01:06:40.611 --> 01:06:42.246
I'm gonna get you.

01:06:42.247 --> 01:06:45.048
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

01:06:45.049 --> 01:06:46.315
Hey!

01:06:46.316 --> 01:06:48.818
Get back here!
Get back here!

01:06:48.819 --> 01:06:51.356
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

01:07:13.544 --> 01:07:16.321
Claire. Claire.

01:07:23.321 --> 01:07:25.658
Morning.

01:07:27.658 --> 01:07:30.664
How was your bachelor party?

01:07:33.664 --> 01:07:35.098
Right?

01:07:35.099 --> 01:07:40.838
Well, that happens.

01:07:40.839 --> 01:07:43.343
No, nothing special.

01:07:46.343 --> 01:07:48.445
Okay.

01:07:48.446 --> 01:07:49.682
Love you, too.

01:07:50.682 --> 01:07:52.622
Bye.

01:07:58.622 --> 01:08:01.863
Well, what happened?

01:08:05.863 --> 01:08:11.101
He said that he lost
$300 at poker...

01:08:12.202 --> 01:08:14.237
got shit-faced drunk...

01:08:14.238 --> 01:08:17.474
had a stripper whip him...

01:08:17.475 --> 01:08:19.846
then he puked and he blacked out.

01:08:23.846 --> 01:08:26.216
That's it?

01:08:26.216 --> 01:08:28.551
And you believe him?

01:08:28.551 --> 01:08:31.386
He doesn't know he butt dialed me.

01:08:31.388 --> 01:08:36.260
He could have lied
about the stripper.

01:08:36.261 --> 01:08:38.551
Where's Leslie?

01:09:00.551 --> 01:09:02.618

01:09:45.696 --> 01:09:49.332
Your wedding ring?

01:09:49.332 --> 01:09:50.634
I wasn't wearing it last night.

01:09:50.635 --> 01:09:55.706
It was in my suitcase
the whole time.

01:09:55.707 --> 01:09:56.772
Leslie, I can't.

01:09:56.773 --> 01:09:59.508
My marriage is over...

01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:01.980

01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:04.417
You're my little sister.

01:10:06.416 --> 01:10:08.990
You can't get married
without a ring, right?

01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:14.867
Thanks.

01:10:22.867 --> 01:10:27.777
Wow, it's actually much bigger

01:10:32.877 --> 01:10:36.015

everything last night?

01:10:37.015 --> 01:10:38.515

01:10:38.516 --> 01:10:41.450

01:10:41.451 --> 01:10:42.886
- Let's have a look.
- Wait.

01:10:42.887 --> 01:10:44.554
No, I don't wanna watch.

01:10:44.555 --> 01:10:45.689
The whole thing was like...

01:10:45.690 --> 01:10:47.456
All right,
we won't watch it then.

01:10:47.457 --> 01:10:48.539
Fuck that, I'm watching it.

01:11:14.886 --> 01:11:17.721
