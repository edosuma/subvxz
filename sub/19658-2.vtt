We may have stopped whoever was
tampering with the satellite,

Not bugs, Gamora, ants.

00:59.994 --> 01:03.195

Ant-Man's trying to tell us something.

This asteroid could endanger
the entire planet.

05:58.881 --> 06:01.348
Once we know Earth is safe,
we can take the <i>Avenjet</i>

06:03.719 --> 06:06.019

can go into space?

06:06.233 --> 06:08.233
We could've been searching

Quill, Captain America doesn't want
the Avengers to go into space.

We can't make him do anything
he doesn't want to do.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.047

06:18.212 --> 06:20.512
Actually, there are several
ways we could force him,

06:20.514 --> 06:22.290

extremely difficult,

06:22.315 --> 06:24.396

12:02.421 --> 12:05.116
Gamma-infused DNA.

12:05.358 --> 12:08.442
Oh, I can't wait to add
that power to my palette.

12:08.467 --> 12:09.764
(GRUNTING)

12:09.789 --> 12:11.361
Not gonna happen.

12:12.087 --> 12:12.804
Hulk!

12:12.829 --> 12:15.024
(GRUNTS) (GROANS)

12:15.569 --> 12:16.516
(GRUNTS)

12:18.437 --> 12:20.071
(AIRCRAFT APPROACHING)

12:22.875 --> 12:24.409
(YELLS)

12:25.778 --> 12:26.784
(GASPING)

12:27.286 --> 12:30.715
I appreciate the assist, Quill, but
next time let us in on your plan.

12:30.717 --> 12:32.669
You're assuming he has one.

12:32.853 --> 12:33.665
Hey!

12:36.255 --> 12:39.424
Fine. We'll do it
the mundane way.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.985
Hybrids, lock onto the asteroid.

12:42.395 --> 12:46.703
It's time to incorporate this
world into my masterpiece.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.867
With the power of the asteroid,

12:48.869 --> 12:54.105
my absorption field will pull the life
force out of this entire planet.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.373
ROCKET: <i>Not gonna let that happen.</i>

12:55.375 --> 12:56.875
PETER: <i>That goes double for us.</i>

13:02.615 --> 13:06.122
I am Groot!

13:06.452 --> 13:10.496
Rocky, give me everything
you've got, all on one side!

13:10.681 --> 13:12.000
But that'll just...

13:12.025 --> 13:14.390
...get us outta this nosedive.

13:14.461 --> 13:15.141
(CHUCKLING)

13:15.166 --> 13:16.169
Nice.

13:29.074 --> 13:30.155
Nice flying.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.987
When this is over, Quill,

13:32.256 --> 13:35.212
you and I need to have a long
talk about sticking to a plan.

13:35.448 --> 13:39.153
Got a plan to stop an energy field
that'll absorb all life on Earth?

13:46.859 --> 13:48.752
Not currently.

13:52.698 --> 13:54.141
You're the fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants
guy, Quill.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.288
What do we do?

13:55.836 --> 13:58.334
Believe it or not, I've got a plan.

13:59.538 --> 14:02.140
Okay, 12 percent of a plan.
Do you trust me?

14:02.142 --> 14:04.594
Enough to actually stick
around and hear it. Shoot.

14:05.812 --> 14:09.344
PETER: <i>Two teams. Team Awesome will
attack the High Evolutionary's ship.</i>

14:09.549 --> 14:12.550
<i>Your job is to keep 'em distracted,
so Team Even More Awesome</i>

14:12.552 --> 14:14.604
<i>can sneak aboard
and shut down that field.</i>

14:27.633 --> 14:28.967
(GRUNTS)

14:28.969 --> 14:30.568
(STRAINING)

14:31.003 --> 14:32.388
(YELLS)

14:33.039 --> 14:37.179
That's why you don't blast someone
with their own powers, you forgery!

14:40.512 --> 14:41.846
(ROARS)

14:41.848 --> 14:45.017
I am not a forgery!

14:46.051 --> 14:47.552
Yeah, he's distracted.

14:47.577 --> 14:50.820
<i>Now watch a pro cause
some real damage, Rocky.</i>

14:51.024 --> 14:54.893
Oh-ho-ho! I'll show you damage,
Princess Sparkle-Fists.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.494
(GRUNTS)

14:58.063 --> 15:00.498
I am Groot!
(GRUNTING)

15:08.841 --> 15:11.576
Huh. At least he didn't
call me Marv.

15:14.113 --> 15:17.515
Okay, Quill, so maybe your team's
dysfunction isn't all your fault.

15:17.540 --> 15:19.106
I know, right?

15:19.586 --> 15:21.301
Wait. How was it
ever my fault?

15:27.026 --> 15:28.626
(CHITTERING)

15:31.597 --> 15:33.865
(GRUNTING)

15:34.281 --> 15:35.934
Hulk, take care of the asteroid.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.268
You mean smash it?

15:37.270 --> 15:39.684
How's about we disconnect it first?

15:42.708 --> 15:44.042
(GRUNTS)

15:45.411 --> 15:46.644
(GRUNTING)

15:50.482 --> 15:53.073
Guys, that rock looks like
it's about to blow!

16:04.229 --> 16:05.756
My absorption field!

16:10.336 --> 16:11.469
(GROANS)

16:13.272 --> 16:16.074
Ooh, there's a prize
at the center of the rock?

16:16.276 --> 16:18.609
CAPTAIN AMERICA: All that energy
from such a small source.

16:18.634 --> 16:19.840
Ever seen anything like it?
