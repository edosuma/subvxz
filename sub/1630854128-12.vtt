- You know, I really need
to get going, all right?

17:07.765 --> 17:08.810
Lots to do.

17:08.853 --> 17:10.290
- Completely understand.

17:10.333 --> 17:13.554
You did have a mixture
of alcohol and benzodiazepines

17:13.597 --> 17:15.121
in your system, though.

17:15.164 --> 17:17.123
- I know what you're thinking
what this might look like,

17:17.165 --> 17:18.472
but it was just
a stupid accident.

17:18.515 --> 17:20.473
- Well, look,
that's good to hear.

17:20.517 --> 17:22.954
I just want to make sure
your prescribing doctor

17:22.998 --> 17:24.260
did make it clear that it's

17:24.304 --> 17:27.089
a potentially lethal
combination.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.178
- I mean, I know you shouldn't
mix medication and alcohol,

17:29.222 --> 17:31.615
but, you know, I defy anyone
to get through a fundraiser

17:31.659 --> 17:33.748
without at least one scotch.

17:33.791 --> 17:35.184
I mean, if I'd known
it was that dangerous--

17:35.228 --> 17:36.664
- Wow.

17:36.707 --> 17:38.970
Your fundraisers sound
pretty stressful to me.

17:39.014 --> 17:41.364
You think that might be
why you took the medication?

17:41.408 --> 17:43.627
- What?
No.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.194
No, look, I just needed to take
the edge off

17:45.238 --> 17:46.195
for the Mathews interview,
all right?

17:46.239 --> 17:47.501
He's tough.

17:47.544 --> 17:48.719
- Do you just--
do you mind me asking

17:48.763 --> 17:50.330
why you were prescribed
benzodiazepines

17:50.373 --> 17:51.635
in the first place?

17:51.679 --> 17:53.333
- Look, this was
a one-off mistake,

17:53.376 --> 17:54.595
and I'd appreciate it
if you'd just check

17:54.638 --> 17:56.597
on my discharge papers.

17:56.640 --> 17:57.815
- Got it.

17:57.859 --> 17:59.948
I will get with Dr. Jacquerie
and see

17:59.991 --> 18:01.689
if we can move that along.

18:01.732 --> 18:02.646
Nice to meet you.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.870
- So what's his deal?

18:08.913 --> 18:10.872
- I don't think
this has ever happened before,

18:10.915 --> 18:12.961
but, you know, he's
definitely self-medicating.

18:13.004 --> 18:14.397
- Depression?

18:14.441 --> 18:15.920
- I think it's some kind
of anxiety disorder,

18:15.964 --> 18:18.793
but anyway, he just wants
to get out of here.

18:18.836 --> 18:20.621
- I don't have
a reason to keep him,

18:20.664 --> 18:22.753
but if he's got an issue--
- Not enough to hold him.

18:22.797 --> 18:24.755
I'll just, you know, make sure
he has the proper referrals

18:24.799 --> 18:25.887
before he leaves.

18:25.930 --> 18:27.541
- Yeah.
This is why I like surgery.

Patients don't talk.

18:28.933 --> 18:32.546
- Hmm.

18:32.589 --> 18:34.548
- Saw you ordered
DNA sequencing

18:34.591 --> 18:37.203
on your patient Jason Rose.

18:37.246 --> 18:38.726
- You reading my charts?

18:38.769 --> 18:41.859
- It's a pretty unusual test
to order in the ED.

18:41.903 --> 18:44.079
Caught my eye.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.994
Apparently no one has anything
they wanna optimize

18:46.037 --> 18:50.259
around here, so I'm
just twiddling my thumbs.

18:50.303 --> 18:53.349
- Jason's brother Axel
died 12 years ago

18:53.393 --> 18:55.960
from uncontrolled seizures,
no diagnosis.

18:56.004 --> 18:57.919
And now that
Jason's had a seizure--

18:57.962 --> 19:00.704
- You think they're connected,
so you ordered the sequence.

19:00.748 --> 19:02.053
- And these.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.581
- Epileptic encephalopathy.

19:07.624 --> 19:09.626
- I ruled out infection,
environmental factors,

19:09.670 --> 19:11.106
and most autoimmune diseases.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.194
Genetic mutation's

19:12.238 --> 19:13.761
the only thing
that makes sense.

19:13.804 --> 19:16.416
- Trouble is,
epileptic encephalopathy

19:16.459 --> 19:18.940
has link to hundreds
of different mutations.

19:18.983 --> 19:20.550
- More like 1,500.

19:20.594 --> 19:22.204
And every disease path has

19:22.248 --> 19:24.293
a different course
of treatment.

19:24.337 --> 19:25.555
So it's gonna take forever
to narrow down

19:25.599 --> 19:27.035
this differential.

19:27.078 --> 19:30.473
- I think I might be able
to do that for you.

19:30.517 --> 19:32.083
I could construct
a neural network

19:32.127 --> 19:33.955
using existing DNA databases.

19:33.998 --> 19:37.306
Basically bundle them all
together and put Jason's DNA

19:37.350 --> 19:38.960
and compare it against
tens of thousands

19:39.003 --> 19:40.527
of known mutations.

19:40.570 --> 19:43.660
This neural network
would take a few hours to code,

19:43.704 --> 19:47.447
but it could give you
a highly probable diagnosis.

19:47.490 --> 19:49.318
- Assuming
the mutation's already

19:49.362 --> 19:51.015
in one of these databases.

19:51.059 --> 19:52.278
- We work with what we have.

19:54.541 --> 19:57.979
- Uh, I appreciate
the offer, Dr. Song,

19:58.022 --> 20:00.024
but these parents are
terrified and need

20:00.068 --> 20:01.809
a human they can turn to.

20:01.852 --> 20:04.768
So I have to figure this out
the best way I know how.

20:04.812 --> 20:06.292
- You know where to find me.

20:06.335 --> 20:10.948
- Yeah.

Nathan's looking all around.

20:13.473 --> 20:16.432
- Sweet boy.
- [laughs]

20:16.476 --> 20:18.956
- So, Laurel, the piece
of retained placenta

20:19.000 --> 20:22.264
has been removed, which
should resolve the bleeding.

20:22.308 --> 20:23.657
- Thank God.

20:23.700 --> 20:26.442
- I'll still be able
to get pregnant, right?

20:26.486 --> 20:28.401
A big family has
always been the dream.

20:28.444 --> 20:30.533
- Infertility is
an extremely rare complication

20:30.577 --> 20:32.143
from a D&C, so yes.

20:32.187 --> 20:34.276
- Then I can go home soon?

20:34.320 --> 20:37.192
- I'd like to continue
monitoring you for a while.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.629
You did have heavy bleeding
for nine days.

20:39.673 --> 20:40.935
- You know, we called
the doctor's office

20:40.978 --> 20:42.458
to try to get checked out
earlier,

20:42.502 --> 20:44.808
and they said it was fine.

20:44.852 --> 20:46.114
- Yeah, I--

20:46.157 --> 20:49.160
I felt like something was off,
had no appetite,

20:49.204 --> 20:50.379
and the bleeding seemed heavy,

20:50.423 --> 20:52.642
but I didn't know if heavy
to me was normal

20:52.686 --> 20:54.296
to the doctors,
you know.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.777
- Bleeding can be difficult
to gauge and is subjective.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.822
- And even harder
to evaluate over the phone.

21:00.476 --> 21:04.263
- Uh.
Oh, uh...

21:04.306 --> 21:09.529
Should I still be bleeding?
