10:48.413 --> 10:49.862

10:49.862 --> 10:52.000
I CAN ACTUALLY GO TO A CANDY

10:52.000 --> 10:55.275

11:36.448 --> 11:40.586
YOU JUST SUCKED A HALF GALLON OF

11:40.586 --> 11:40.896
GAS.

11:40.896 --> 11:42.068

13:24.344 --> 13:25.586
THIS IS WHAT IT MUST FEEL LIKE

13:25.586 --> 13:27.758
TO WORK AT CVS.

13:27.758 --> 13:28.689
>> DO YOU HAVE AN OPEN MARRIAGE?

13:28.689 --> 13:30.137
>> NO, I DON'T.

13:30.137 --> 13:31.586
>> UNLESS YOU AND YOUR WIFE

13:31.586 --> 13:32.965
WANTED TO SWITCH PARTNERS.

13:32.965 --> 13:33.344

13:55.310 --> 13:56.655
>> OH, PONY.

13:56.655 --> 14:00.068

14:55.344 --> 14:58.931
TIME TO CATFISH AGAIN.

14:58.931 --> 15:01.896
IN THAT TWO SECONDS, SHE HAD

15:01.896 --> 15:02.620
ALREADY COVERED THAT DISTANCE.

15:02.620 --> 15:08.000

15:22.137 --> 15:23.931
HE'S GOING TO BE OUT FOR A

15:23.931 --> 15:24.413

15:24.413 --> 15:26.310
NONE OF THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.

15:26.310 --> 15:28.344
I HAD INFO WARS MAKE IT.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
BUFFALO'S STARTING CORNERBACK

16:05.000 --> 16:06.586
NEXT WEEK.

16:06.586 --> 16:08.413
IS THERE ANYTHING GROCER THAN

16:08.413 --> 16:12.172
WATCHING A STEELERS FAN RUB A

16:12.172 --> 16:16.931
BILLS FAN'S FAT LEG?

16:30.206 --> 16:31.517
EVERY DOLPHINS SEASON AND ALL

16:31.517 --> 16:33.931
HOPE IS LOST AND IT'S TIME TO

COMMITTEE HATES CINDERELLA, BUT

16:58.862 --> 17:02.068
LOVES THE INBRED STEPSISTER LIKE

17:02.068 --> 17:03.379
WEST VIRGINIA.

17:03.379 --> 17:05.379
UCF WOULD LOSE EVERY SINGLE GAME

17:05.379 --> 17:06.758
IF THEY PLAYED IN THE S.E.C.,

17:06.758 --> 17:09.000
YET LAST SEASON WE BEAT AUBURN

17:09.000 --> 17:10.551
WHO SMOKED 'BAMA AND GEORGIA

17:10.551 --> 17:11.827
DESPITE BEING HANDICAPPED, AND

17:11.827 --> 17:13.103
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT OUR STAR

17:13.103 --> 17:15.034
SAFETY PLAYING WITH ONE HAND

17:15.034 --> 17:17.206
TIED BEHIND HIS BACK FIGURE

17:17.206 --> 17:17.586
TIFFLY.

17:17.586 --> 17:20.655
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE INTERIM

17:20.655 --> 17:24.137
COACH WE PAWNED OFF ON NEBRASKA.

17:24.137 --> 17:27.000
THE PAC-12 HASN'T BEEN RELEVANT

17:27.000 --> 17:27.862
SINCE THAT PETE CARROLL WAS

17:27.862 --> 17:29.448
CHEATING AND NOTRE DAME ISN'T

17:29.448 --> 17:30.862

NO ONE UNDER 90 CARES ABOUT THEM

17:32.896 --> 17:36.034
EXCEPT FOR PRIESTS WITH SOME

17:36.034 --> 17:36.413
SECRETS.

17:36.413 --> 17:37.275
IT'S 2018.

17:37.275 --> 17:41.655

17:51.103 --> 17:53.482
SABAN'S EYE FOR TALENT IS A

17:53.482 --> 17:53.827
JOKE.

17:53.827 --> 17:55.620
HE THOUGHT DREW BREES WAS WASHED

17:55.620 --> 17:56.689
UP IN 2006.

17:56.689 --> 18:03.620
TRY TO WRAP YOUR SIMPLE EL MINES

18:03.620 --> 18:04.034

ALLOWING BLACK PEOPLE TO ATTEND

18:19.655 --> 18:22.724
OUR CAMPUS FROM DAY ONE?

18:22.724 --> 18:23.896
I DON'T KNOW THAT UCF WOULD BEAT

18:23.896 --> 18:25.931
'BAMA IN THE PLAYOFFS, BUT WE

18:25.931 --> 18:27.655
PUT UP MORE THAN TWO FIELD GOALS

18:27.655 --> 18:28.517
LIKE CLEMSON.

18:28.517 --> 18:30.413
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF WE HAVE A

20:18.551 --> 20:21.000
IT WAS REALLY DUMPING THAT DAY.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.034
FINALLY, IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY

20:22.034 --> 20:23.793
WEEK THERE IS ANOTHER SENSELESS

20:23.793 --> 20:25.103
MASS SHOOTING WHICH MEANS I HAVE

20:25.103 --> 20:31.931
TO CUT OUT MY HYSTERICAL GUN

20:31.931 --> 20:32.241
JOKES.

20:32.241 --> 20:32.551
WHY?

20:32.551 --> 20:35.517
I'M A COMPASSIONATE HUMAN.

20:35.517 --> 20:35.965
NO MORE.

20:35.965 --> 20:38.827
I FOUND A GUN SHOOTING TO REMIND

20:38.827 --> 20:44.103
US SHOOTINGS CAN BE

20:44.103 --> 20:47.724
LIGHTHEARTED.

20:47.724 --> 20:49.172
IT'S NOT ATTEMPTED MURDER IF

20:49.172 --> 20:52.034
IT'S BELOW THE WAIST.

20:52.034 --> 20:54.068
I'D LIKE TO PREWISH YOU A HAPPY

20:54.068 --> 20:56.827
THANKSGIVING, HANUKKAH, NEW

20:56.827 --> 20:58.965
YEAR'S, BOTH REGULAR AND

20:58.965 --> 21:00.068
CHINESE, VALENTINE'S, ST.

21:00.068 --> 21:03.327
PATRICK'S DAY.

21:03.327 --> 21:03.551
GOOD NIGHT.
