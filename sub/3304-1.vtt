00:15.358 --> 00:18.760
- All right, Slate. Show time.

00:18.829 --> 00:21.024
- You sure you don't wanna
go for a swim?

00:21.131 --> 00:23.998
- Tariq told me to tell you
come back with the gold

00:24.067 --> 00:25.797
or don't come back at all.

00:25.870 --> 00:28.498
- Well, I don't think we gotta
worry about Tariq.

00:28.573 --> 00:31.542
- No one's ever found anything
down there before.

00:31.643 --> 00:33.771
What makes you think
you're any different?

00:33.846 --> 00:36.474
- Well, the Blue hole is a
bottomless pit.

00:36.549 --> 00:38.141
Not even Cousteau can
swim the bottom.

00:38.217 --> 00:41.984
But I can. And he
didn't have these.

00:42.055 --> 00:43.818
- Sonars, guns, and C4.

00:43.890 --> 00:46.859
You're gonna bury yourself
underthe sea floor and silt.

00:46.927 --> 00:49.556
- Well, then I won't have to
deal with Tariq, will I?

00:49.664 --> 00:52.724
You'll have to face him alone
and without the gold.

01:02.544 --> 01:04.672
( heavy breathing )

01:15.392 --> 01:18.828
- Hey, mon, it's getting
cold over here.

01:18.896 --> 01:24.494
- Let's keep going. The
shelf's straight ahead.

01:24.569 --> 01:26.662
( Sonar pinging )

01:29.976 --> 01:32.911
- It's not working.

01:35.749 --> 01:37.717
- All right, let's head down.

01:37.784 --> 01:39.945
- I don't like this at all.

01:46.728 --> 01:48.355
- How much farther?

01:48.429 --> 01:51.194
- I'm gonna look for a spot
to set the charges.

01:51.267 --> 01:52.427
It's where it's buried.

01:52.501 --> 01:56.062
Cortez should be right
underneath it.

01:56.138 --> 01:57.799
( static )

02:07.285 --> 02:11.244
- Okay, come here. Bring
me the charges.

02:17.029 --> 02:18.894
I'll plant a few charges here.

02:18.964 --> 02:20.761
You guys set the perimeter.

02:31.545 --> 02:32.773
I need you goin' off
to the left.

02:32.846 --> 02:34.643
- Let's go.

02:45.060 --> 02:48.656
All right, mon. we are
set over here.

02:48.731 --> 02:52.030
- That's what I like.

02:52.134 --> 02:53.261

06:42.795 --> 06:46.630
- What'd I tell you? Just wait.

06:46.733 --> 06:48.564
- Just wait for what?

06:48.635 --> 06:51.798
- Yeah, I may or may not have a
little surprise in store.

06:51.905 --> 06:55.137
But it's perfectly safe.
Trust me.

06:55.242 --> 06:57.904
- Why do I need to be
reassured that it's safe?

06:57.979 --> 07:00.209
- Come on. Can you
just chill out?

07:00.281 --> 07:03.217
Relax and enjoy the view.
Look where we are.

07:03.285 --> 07:06.448
This is amazing. It's gorgeous.

07:06.521 --> 07:08.490
- We are gonna have
so much fun.

07:08.591 --> 07:11.651
- I know. Come on. Let's
get checked in.

07:28.980 --> 07:30.811
- Sarah!

07:30.882 --> 07:31.975
- Hi, Henry. How are you?

07:32.051 --> 07:33.916
- Good, good.
- Good.

07:33.986 --> 07:36.511
- Today is going to be a
beautiful day.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.681
You heading back out to the
barrier reef today?

07:38.791 --> 07:40.783
- Um, it depends.
You available?

07:40.861 --> 07:42.829
I need some samples
for the lab.

07:42.896 --> 07:46.627
- I'm actually takin' a couple
out here in the boat an hour.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.191
Just snorkelin', though.

07:48.302 --> 07:51.100
But I'm free for diving
this afternoon.

07:51.172 --> 07:52.196
One p.m. work?

07:52.306 --> 07:53.364
- One p.m. is perfect.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.705
- Good. See you then.

07:59.181 --> 08:03.209
- Babe, let's go!
- I'm coming.

08:03.319 --> 08:05.844
- Ready?
- Yeah.

08:05.922 --> 08:09.358
So why didn't we spend the week
on the mainland again?

08:09.426 --> 08:10.655
- You didn't like the
Mayan ruins?

08:10.728 --> 08:12.195
- No, I liked it.

08:12.263 --> 08:14.128
It's just seven days of
nonstop hiking is not

08:14.198 --> 08:16.689
my idea of a vacation.

08:16.767 --> 08:20.465
- You helped me plan this trip.

08:20.539 --> 08:22.234
Okay, fine.

08:22.340 --> 08:24.205
You get to choose all the things
we do next time.

08:24.276 --> 08:26.677
- Oh, what makes you so sure
there's gonna be a next time?

08:26.746 --> 08:29.977
We ought to stay here and hang
out with the locals.

08:30.049 --> 08:33.577
- Really? You're hilarious,
you know that?

08:33.687 --> 08:35.484
Are you ready to
snorkel or what?

08:35.556 --> 08:37.148
( fog horn blares )

08:40.059 --> 08:41.653
- Henry, right?
- Rod, yes.

08:41.730 --> 08:42.991
- Hi, I'm Jane.

08:43.063 --> 08:44.554
- Hey, nice to meet you guys.

08:44.632 --> 08:45.860
- Nice to meet you too. I
hope we're not late.

08:45.934 --> 08:47.401
- Not at all.

08:47.469 --> 08:49.165
So you guys ready to go
snorkel at the Blue Hole?

08:49.238 --> 08:51.706
- Yeah, man, yeah. We're
both really excited.

08:51.774 --> 08:53.105
- The Blue Hole?

08:53.209 --> 08:55.871
- Yes, the Blue Hole.
Welcome on board.

08:55.945 --> 08:56.878
- Thanks.

08:56.947 --> 08:58.938
- Yes.

09:03.320 --> 09:05.721
- So who here has gone
snorkeling before?

09:05.790 --> 09:08.224
Not like this, you haven't.

09:08.292 --> 09:09.884
Snorkeling at the
Lighthouse Reef

09:09.961 --> 09:12.556
is unlike snorkeling
anywhere else on earth.

09:12.631 --> 09:17.364
And if you're really daring,
you can swim across
the Blue Hole.

09:17.436 --> 09:18.960
Most people are not.

09:19.071 --> 09:22.303
Now the ride to the reef is
about an hour from here.

09:22.408 --> 09:26.242
So I suggest you just relax
and enjoy the ride.

09:26.312 --> 09:28.110
- What is the Blue Hole?

09:28.182 --> 09:32.380
- It's a huge sinkhole about
three foot five feet across.

09:32.453 --> 09:33.647
And six down.

09:33.754 --> 09:35.552
- And you knew about this?

09:35.624 --> 09:38.559
- You're gonna love it.
You're gonna love it.

09:38.627 --> 09:40.322
- You're gonna love it.

09:40.428 --> 09:41.656
- Turn on some music, Jibuti.

09:41.763 --> 09:43.231

09:43.299 --> 09:45.062

10:05.123 --> 10:06.853
- This hole is huge.

10:06.959 --> 10:10.122
- Is that a shark?

10:10.196 --> 10:14.031
- Just tiger sharks,
then bull sharks.

12:10.332 --> 12:12.232
Saw a body out there floating.

12:12.300 --> 12:13.961
One guy.

12:14.035 --> 12:15.559
I don't know if he's conscious,
unconscious or what.

12:15.637 --> 12:17.264
- We gotta get him out
of the water.

12:17.339 --> 12:20.002
Start the engine.

12:32.489 --> 12:34.924
There he is.

13:00.421 --> 13:03.515
- Is he alive?

13:03.591 --> 13:07.790
- He's breathing, barely.

13:07.863 --> 13:11.890
He's got a pulse. It's
kind of weak.

13:12.001 --> 13:14.401
He probably had a concussion,
maybe even the bends.

13:14.504 --> 13:17.064
We probably better get
him to a hospital.

13:17.173 --> 13:21.008
- No, no hospitals.

13:21.078 --> 13:22.705
- We can take him back
to our place.

13:22.780 --> 13:24.907
- Well, shouldn't a professional
come and look at him?

13:25.015 --> 13:28.213
- I know someone we can call.

13:31.056 --> 13:34.548
- Oh. what do you make of that?

14:02.925 --> 14:05.257
- Why them boy take so long?

14:05.327 --> 14:08.695
They should have been
back by now.

14:08.765 --> 14:11.359
Find out what happened.

14:11.434 --> 14:14.427
Slate double-crossed me again.

14:14.505 --> 14:20.444
This time, he must pay
with his life.

14:20.511 --> 14:22.605
- Let's go.

14:32.191 --> 14:33.215
( groans )

14:33.292 --> 14:36.284
- Hey, guys, he's waking up.

14:38.999 --> 14:43.595
- Where am I? Who are you guys?

14:43.670 --> 14:46.162
- We found you out there by the
reef barely breathing.

14:46.274 --> 14:47.639
We gave you CPR.

14:47.709 --> 14:48.835
But wasn't sure if you
were gonna make it

14:48.943 --> 14:50.069
for a second there.

14:50.145 --> 14:51.737
- You gave me CPR?

14:51.813 --> 14:54.578
- You woke up just long enough
to say ''no hospitals''.

14:54.650 --> 14:56.311
So we brought you back
here to this hotel.

14:56.385 --> 14:58.853
I'm Sarah, this is Henry.

14:58.954 --> 15:00.513
He called me from the
boat to meet you.

15:00.624 --> 15:02.091
And this is their place.

15:02.159 --> 15:04.423
They were on the boat with Henry.

15:04.494 --> 15:07.258
Thanks, you guys. I'm Jackson.

15:07.330 --> 15:09.697
Most people just call me Jacks.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.995
- All right, Jacks.
How's the head?

15:12.069 --> 15:14.970
- Drink the local fruit wine,
you'll figure it out.

15:15.039 --> 15:18.305
I think I'll survive.

15:18.377 --> 15:20.106
- So you wanna tell us what
happened out there?

15:20.179 --> 15:23.012
- Uh, not really, no.

15:23.081 --> 15:26.449
- What about this? You wanna
tell us about this?

15:26.519 --> 15:30.285
( grunts )

15:30.356 --> 15:34.020
- Now I am going to ask
you one more time.

15:34.094 --> 15:37.461
Where is Tariq's money?

15:37.531 --> 15:40.558
- I don't know.

15:40.669 --> 15:44.230
( grunts )

15:44.339 --> 15:48.674
Oh, man, you been workin' out.
I actually felt that one.

15:48.744 --> 15:50.041
Ah!

15:57.020 --> 15:57.987
( gunshot )

15:58.055 --> 15:59.579
Hey! Hey!

15:59.690 --> 16:03.889
- Now I'm going to ask
you one more time.

16:03.962 --> 16:06.897
Where is Tariq's money?

16:06.965 --> 16:08.523
- We didn't find anything,
all right?

16:08.600 --> 16:11.001
We went into the jungle. There
was no Mayan gold.

16:11.070 --> 16:12.560
No nothing, just death.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.333
- I tell you what I think.

16:14.406 --> 16:17.273
I think that you found exactly
what you were looking for

16:17.376 --> 16:19.572
and decided to keep it
for yourself.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.546
and kill our men!

16:21.615 --> 16:23.583
You better start making sense.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.083
Then where is it?

16:25.151 --> 16:29.350
- It's at the bottom of
the Blue Hole.

16:29.423 --> 16:31.584
- What the hell are you
talking about?

16:31.659 --> 16:35.687
- I'm talking about
Spanish gold.

16:35.764 --> 16:37.561
( laughter )

16:42.338 --> 16:45.603
- He's talking about Mayan
gold, the gold that

16:45.675 --> 16:48.975
the Governor Cortez stole from
the native people.

16:49.079 --> 16:52.879
No one has found it. No one
knows where it is.

16:52.950 --> 16:57.285
- I know where it is.

16:57.355 --> 17:02.054
- All right, but I warn you.

17:02.127 --> 17:04.425
You try anything, Slate,
anything at all,

17:04.497 --> 17:06.488
I will put a bullet
in your head

17:06.598 --> 17:09.067
and bury you in that
hole myself.

17:09.135 --> 17:12.902
- Okay, I get it, I get it.

17:12.973 --> 17:15.567
I found it snorkeling.

17:15.642 --> 17:18.338
It's amazing what people
leave behind, huh?

17:18.444 --> 17:20.175
- You mean, like the Mayans?

17:20.281 --> 17:22.407
- I dove to the bottom of
the Blue Hole.

17:22.483 --> 17:26.351
- You went to the bottom? what
else did you find?

17:30.859 --> 17:32.656
Hey, look, man.

17:32.728 --> 17:34.195
You don't have to tell us
anything you don't want to.

17:34.296 --> 17:35.457
But I'm sure the police
will find this

17:35.532 --> 17:37.295
all pretty interesting.

17:37.367 --> 17:40.928
- Well, I don't wanna
involve you guys

17:41.004 --> 17:42.266
in anything too dangerous.

17:45.009 --> 17:49.776
But if you really wanna know...

17:49.847 --> 17:53.443
Get me a beer and let's go outside.

18:01.561 --> 18:02.823
( phone rings )

18:02.895 --> 18:05.455
- Yes, boss?
- Any sign of them boys?

18:05.531 --> 18:07.329
- No, boss, but the port here

18:07.401 --> 18:10.199
around the Blue Hole shut
down and are locked.

18:10.270 --> 18:14.503
The Coast Guard in there. They
find a boat missing.

18:14.576 --> 18:17.807
Wreck smashed off the rocks.
Passengers presumed dead.

18:17.879 --> 18:19.369
What else you want me to do?

18:19.447 --> 18:21.312
- I want you to keep looking
until you find them,

18:21.383 --> 18:23.750
or their bodies.

18:23.853 --> 18:27.186
- Yes, boss. Raul, let's go.

18:30.427 --> 18:33.396
- So you're saying you owe this
Tariq guy a lot of money

18:33.463 --> 18:34.589
and you were gonna pay him
off with the gold?

18:34.698 --> 18:36.063
- Oh, forget Tariq.

18:36.133 --> 18:37.601
As far as he knows, I'm
already dead.

18:37.702 --> 18:40.865
That gold's still out there.
Tell you what.

18:40.938 --> 18:43.065
I'm willing to cut you in if
you guys help me find it.

18:43.141 --> 18:46.077
- Aren't you
forgetting something?

18:46.145 --> 18:49.012
Someone out there did
kill those men.

18:49.081 --> 18:51.072
And if it wasn't you, then we
should be worried

18:51.150 --> 18:53.745
about who or what.

18:53.820 --> 18:55.720
- What do you mean, or what?

18:55.789 --> 18:58.758
- I mean, right now we
don't know anything.

18:58.825 --> 19:00.384
But Dr. Jones here has been
setting off charges

19:00.461 --> 19:01.860
in Blue Hole.

19:01.929 --> 19:03.556
So who knows what the hell
he's unearthed?

19:03.631 --> 19:05.292
- What exactly are you saying?

19:05.399 --> 19:07.697
- I'm saying I'm in.

19:07.768 --> 19:09.464
I don't care about
the Spanish gold

19:09.571 --> 19:10.970
or lost treasure.

19:11.072 --> 19:14.064
I just wanna know what's
out there.

19:14.142 --> 19:16.134
- I care about the gold.

19:16.245 --> 19:18.042
- Yes, me too. - Rod?

19:18.114 --> 19:19.581
- Count me in.

19:19.649 --> 19:21.583
Listen, we came out here to
dive that hole anyways.

19:21.651 --> 19:26.112
And now I see more reasons
to go...a lot more.

19:26.190 --> 19:28.556
I say we go for the gold.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.256
- The police will be
patrolling the air

19:33.331 --> 19:34.798
between here and the reef.

19:34.866 --> 19:36.800
- Well, we'll have to go the
long way around.

19:36.868 --> 19:38.062
Half Moon Key, huh?

19:38.136 --> 19:39.798
Help me with the rest of this.

19:52.552 --> 19:54.417
( phone rings )

19:54.489 --> 19:57.617
- Any sign of Edric
and the others?

19:57.692 --> 19:59.421
- No, boss, only Slate.

19:59.494 --> 20:01.655
And he's going out with some
different people.

20:01.729 --> 20:03.129
None of we people.

20:03.198 --> 20:04.597
- That bastard has
double-crossed us

20:04.666 --> 20:06.258
for the last time.

20:06.335 --> 20:07.700
You know what to do!

20:07.803 --> 20:09.532
- Yes, boss, and the
rest of them?

20:09.638 --> 20:13.200
- No witnesses, not one
to tell the tale.

20:13.309 --> 20:16.540
- Yes, boss.

20:16.646 --> 20:20.481
When they curl Half Moon Key,
we're gonna wait for them.

20:20.551 --> 20:21.848
Let's go.

20:25.423 --> 20:28.051
- Rod? A word?

20:31.663 --> 20:33.359
Are we seriously going
through with this?

20:33.432 --> 20:36.401
I mean, I don't wanna die on
some wild goose chase

20:36.502 --> 20:37.969
for some lost treasure.

20:38.037 --> 20:39.527
Did you forget the part
where some gangsters

20:39.605 --> 20:40.903
are trying to kill him?

20:41.008 --> 20:43.033
Or, like she said, there
could be something

20:43.110 --> 20:44.873
out there that's even
worse than them.

20:44.945 --> 20:46.913
Stop acting like you're
in "The Goonies".

20:47.014 --> 20:47.878
( chuckles )

20:47.948 --> 20:49.246
- "The Goonies"?   Listen.

20:49.350 --> 20:51.250
I think that you need
to calm down.

20:51.352 --> 20:52.751
Change your mind and
come with us.

20:52.854 --> 20:54.151
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

20:54.222 --> 20:56.384
- No, Rod, I want us to
stay together.

20:56.458 --> 20:58.358
Otherwise, I'm gonna go
back to the hotel

20:58.427 --> 21:00.657
and you can have your little
adventure on your own.

21:00.729 --> 21:03.061
- Listen, I hear you.

21:03.132 --> 21:05.033
I just think it's a little bit
too late for that.

21:05.101 --> 21:07.001
We're already set, loaded up,
and ready to go.

21:07.070 --> 21:08.935
There could be a lot of
gold out there.

21:09.039 --> 21:12.737
- Look, if you go on that dive,

21:12.810 --> 21:14.835
I'm gonna be really upset.

21:17.648 --> 21:19.708
- I'm gonna go.

21:19.785 --> 21:23.118
We'll see you back at
the hotel, okay?

21:35.936 --> 21:37.403
- Is it just me?

21:37.471 --> 21:39.769
The woman doesn't look too
happy with you.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.740
- Yep.
- Don't worry.

21:41.809 --> 21:45.439
She'll be a lot happier when
you bring back the gold, huh?

21:45.513 --> 21:48.038
- That's the plan.

21:57.593 --> 21:59.994
- Raul, here they come!
See them there?

22:00.097 --> 22:02.156
Get ready for the shot!

22:06.304 --> 22:09.831
Now remember, when
they get close,

22:09.941 --> 22:11.568
we'll pull up side of them.

22:11.643 --> 22:15.774
I say hello and then goodbye.

22:19.718 --> 22:21.687
( rumbling )

22:21.788 --> 22:23.779
- Whoa!

22:28.361 --> 22:30.660
- Something out there!
Something big!

22:30.731 --> 22:33.791
( growling )

22:33.868 --> 22:35.495
- Start up the boat, boy!
Start up the boat!

22:35.569 --> 22:38.334
Let's go! Let's go!

22:38.407 --> 22:41.604
Come on, boy! - I'm trying!

22:42.744 --> 22:43.836
( gunfire )

22:43.912 --> 22:45.039
( screaming )

22:51.854 --> 22:53.652
- Hurry, boy, hurry!

22:54.858 --> 22:56.621
( gunshots, screaming)

23:01.566 --> 23:04.501
- Hey! You guys see
that up ahead?

23:04.569 --> 23:09.633
There!

23:09.709 --> 23:13.042
- Hey, there's some wreckage
out there!

23:13.112 --> 23:15.046
Check that out, take me to it.

23:43.646 --> 23:45.238
- Just like before.

23:45.315 --> 23:47.341
Another wrecked boat with no
sign of survivors.

23:47.418 --> 23:49.443
Not even any bodies.

23:49.553 --> 23:52.522
- What the hell is goin' on?

23:57.462 --> 24:00.022
- This is the Coast Guard.
Remain where you are!

24:00.098 --> 24:02.624
- Damn!
- Great.

24:02.735 --> 24:06.865
We got visitors.

24:06.939 --> 24:08.736
- Prepare to be boarded.

24:12.246 --> 24:15.545
You people wanna tell me what
the hell you're doing out here?

24:15.616 --> 24:16.810
You got a name?

24:16.917 --> 24:19.045
- Who's asking?
- Cut the bullshit.

24:19.120 --> 24:20.712
I wanna know who you people are

24:20.789 --> 24:23.223
and what you are doing at
the Blue Hole.

24:23.291 --> 24:24.815
- Blue Hole?

24:24.926 --> 24:26.554
- Don't play dumb with me.

24:26.629 --> 24:29.223
That boat of yours had a
registered dive

24:29.298 --> 24:31.823
out at the hole at nine
this morning.

24:31.934 --> 24:34.301
And then there's this.

24:34.371 --> 24:37.397
You fancy yourselves some kind
of treasure hunter?

24:37.474 --> 24:39.772
- Look, you can't keep us here.

24:39.843 --> 24:41.607
We haven't done anything wrong.

24:41.679 --> 24:44.739
- Where do you think you are?
You think this is the U.S.?

24:44.816 --> 24:47.842
I've got two boats destroyed.
Covered in blood.

24:47.952 --> 24:50.478
Maybe you did find something.

24:50.556 --> 24:53.423
And maybe you killed your
friend over it.

24:53.492 --> 24:56.154
- Okay, look. My name's
Jackson Slate.

24:56.228 --> 24:59.687
I was diving the Blue Hole to
see what I could salvage.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.357
The last thing I remember,
there was an earthquake.

25:01.467 --> 25:02.991
When I came to, these
people rescued me.

25:03.069 --> 25:05.971
We decided to come back out
here and investigate.

25:06.040 --> 25:07.439
And that's when we found this.

25:07.508 --> 25:10.306
- Look, we've got a
real problem here

25:10.377 --> 25:13.176
and I think you know damn
well it isn't us.

25:13.248 --> 25:16.012
- In all my years
working these parts,

25:16.084 --> 25:20.181
I have never seen
anything like this.

25:20.256 --> 25:21.848
- Oh, my God!

25:21.924 --> 25:26.327
- Let alone twice in one
goddamned day.

25:26.395 --> 25:27.522
Not even drug runners.

25:27.598 --> 25:28.963
- This wasn't drug runners.

25:29.032 --> 25:31.728
This was bitten off by
something big,

25:31.835 --> 25:33.325
something really big.

25:33.403 --> 25:35.895
- Whatever it is, it's big enough

25:36.007 --> 25:38.066
to tear a dive boat to shreds.

25:38.176 --> 25:39.700
- We need to have an advisory

25:39.777 --> 25:42.644
and tell the people to stay
out of the water.

25:42.714 --> 25:43.704
- We need to go into
that Blue Hole.

25:43.782 --> 25:45.181
Think about it.

25:45.251 --> 25:46.809
This all started after he
went down there.

25:46.886 --> 25:48.547
Maybe he disturbed something.

25:48.621 --> 25:50.681
We need to khow what
we're dealing with

25:50.757 --> 25:52.725
while we can still do
something about it.

25:52.792 --> 25:54.692
- All right, Slate.

25:54.761 --> 25:57.093
Look like you get to go
back and hunt

25:57.197 --> 25:58.756
for your lost
treasure after all.

25:58.866 --> 25:59.924
- Yeah. What about.. .

26:00.034 --> 26:04.232
- Sorry. Property of Belize.

26:04.305 --> 26:07.332
- At least you know
where there's more.

26:09.745 --> 26:11.679
- Any word from Rafa and Raul?

26:11.747 --> 26:13.578
- Nothing yet, big man.

26:13.649 --> 26:16.175
- If they are not back by sundown,

26:16.252 --> 26:18.015
I'll find Jackson Slate myself

26:18.087 --> 26:20.055
and skin him and his friends alive!

26:20.123 --> 26:21.887
( cocks gun )

26:24.128 --> 26:26.426
- So, Jackson, you left
out a few details

26:26.497 --> 26:28.021
when you were talking
to the police.

26:28.098 --> 26:29.930
What do you think really
happened down there?

26:30.001 --> 26:34.768
- Honestly, I think Tariq's
guys blew the charges early

26:34.839 --> 26:36.739
and left me for dead.

26:36.808 --> 26:38.401
But somebody came back and
took care of them.

26:38.477 --> 26:41.241
I'm sure you got a
different theory.

26:41.314 --> 26:43.612
- Yeah. All I know is there's
something out there

26:43.683 --> 26:44.946
destroying boats.

26:45.018 --> 26:46.815
And we just happen to
be on a boat.

26:46.920 --> 26:49.582
- These guys got plenty of
gun power and sonar.

26:49.656 --> 26:51.453
Anything comes at 'em, I'm sure
they'll take care of it.

26:51.525 --> 26:53.790
- Tell me, how did
you get involved

26:53.861 --> 26:55.658
with those low-life
gangsters anyway?

26:55.763 --> 26:58.891
And were you really gonna pay
them back the gold?

26:58.967 --> 27:02.734
- Of course...probably.

27:02.805 --> 27:04.773
- Probably not.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.102
( chuckles )

- Hey, what's up, guys?
- Oh, nothin'.

27:32.872 --> 27:34.806
We're just down here in Belize
for training right now.

27:34.874 --> 27:36.774
Just kind of drinkin', relaxin'.
Kickin' with the locals.

27:36.843 --> 27:38.504
I don't know if
you're interested.

27:38.578 --> 27:41.275
But my buddy, he's got a boat
right down the beach.

27:41.348 --> 27:42.872
You wanna join us? - A boat?

27:42.983 --> 27:44.351
- Yeah. Would you like to see it?

27:44.351 --> 27:46.319
- Uh, no, I shouldn't.

27:46.387 --> 27:48.356
- Aw, come on. You can lay out.

27:48.423 --> 27:50.687
And we'll drink tons of
champagne, have some caviar.

27:50.759 --> 27:52.454
- You guys are full of shit.

27:52.527 --> 27:55.463
- You'll never know unless you go.

27:58.367 --> 28:01.029
- All right, yeah.

28:03.907 --> 28:05.670
So what kind of boat is this?

28:05.742 --> 28:06.343
- Sure you boys don't
wanna go for a swim?

28:06.343 --> 28:08.675
- Sure you boys don't
wanna go for a swim?

28:08.745 --> 28:12.147
- Ha! I don't get paid enough
to do anything this crazy.

28:12.216 --> 28:13.706
- All right.

28:13.785 --> 28:17.050
Well, just keep a lookout,
will you?

28:17.121 --> 28:18.214
- Good luck.

28:18.290 --> 28:21.020
- Thank you.

28:26.933 --> 28:28.696
You afraid of the dark?

28:28.768 --> 28:31.362
- Not of the dark. Just
what's in it.

28:31.438 --> 28:34.203
- I told you what's in it.
Spanish gold.

28:34.275 --> 28:36.573
- Woo-hoo! Yeah, baby.

28:36.644 --> 28:40.444
- Or in some people's opinion,
Mayan gold.

28:40.548 --> 28:43.245
Gotta tell you, it's
not what's in it

28:43.318 --> 28:44.842
that you gotta be afraid of.

28:44.920 --> 28:47.115
When you get down to
about 200 feet,

28:47.222 --> 28:48.884
the pressure's gonna be so bad
it's gonna make your chest

28:48.958 --> 28:50.858
feel like it's gonna explode.

28:50.927 --> 28:55.091
Get down to 300, nitrogen
narcosis kicks in,

28:55.164 --> 28:56.757
you're gonna feel dizzy.

28:56.834 --> 28:58.893
You're gonna think that you might
be seeing some things.

28:58.969 --> 29:02.803
But it's nothing compared to
when you get down to 400 feet.

29:02.906 --> 29:05.535
- You know what, Jacks? why
don't you save it?

29:05.610 --> 29:08.636
- You panic and come up too
fast, you're gonna die.

29:08.746 --> 29:14.379
So just breathe normal
and don't panic.

29:14.453 --> 29:16.080
If any of you guys feel like
you need to back out now,

29:16.155 --> 29:20.752
now's the time to tell me.

29:20.827 --> 29:22.590
( chuckles )

29:22.662 --> 29:27.065
- Jacks, I'm not really one to
back out of things ever.

29:27.134 --> 29:29.330
But I think it'd be a good idea
to keep a man onboard

29:29.437 --> 29:31.166
and keep an eye on things.

29:31.272 --> 29:35.642
Make sure you guys are safe
while you're down there diving.

29:35.711 --> 29:39.442
So I think I'm gonna sit
this one out, huh?

29:39.515 --> 29:41.312
- Yeah, sure.

29:41.383 --> 29:44.114
- Hey, hey!

29:44.187 --> 29:46.985
I'll still get my cut, though,
right?

29:47.056 --> 29:48.318
- Yeah.

29:48.391 --> 29:50.359
- All right. You're a good man.

29:50.461 --> 29:52.156
Good luck, man.

30:00.572 --> 30:02.267
( sonar pings )

30:20.227 --> 30:25.222
- Shelf's right up ahead here.
Get ready to go down.

30:35.611 --> 30:37.307
Is everyone all right?

30:37.380 --> 30:39.371
- Getting deeper now.

30:39.449 --> 30:41.508
( static )

30:54.433 --> 30:58.335
- There's the Cortez in
her final glory.

31:01.274 --> 31:03.834
Okay, you guys follow me,
all right?

31:03.910 --> 31:06.208
Let's go forward.

31:06.279 --> 31:07.907
- Okay, I'll follow you.

31:15.322 --> 31:18.417
- See those?

31:18.493 --> 31:22.452
- These are dinosaur
footprints, I think!

31:29.272 --> 31:32.640
Look at the eggs!

31:35.846 --> 31:38.748
We've got to take one
back to the lab!

31:38.816 --> 31:41.444
- Okay.

32:07.615 --> 32:10.312
I've seen enough. Let's
get outta here.

32:12.521 --> 32:13.852
( screams )

32:13.955 --> 32:16.287
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

32:16.358 --> 32:17.656
- Relax.

32:17.727 --> 32:19.490
You all right?

32:21.497 --> 32:22.828
Okay?

32:22.899 --> 32:25.266
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

32:37.048 --> 32:38.538
- You guys all right?

32:38.650 --> 32:40.208
You were down there for a
long time, ma'am.

32:40.318 --> 32:41.877
I thought we lost you.

32:41.987 --> 32:43.545
- You nearly did.

32:43.656 --> 32:45.817
- Yeah.

32:45.891 --> 32:47.449
We ran into my old crew down there.

32:47.526 --> 32:50.519
They were torn apart,
trampled or something.

32:50.597 --> 32:52.121
- What else did you guys
see down there?

32:52.199 --> 32:54.895
- We saw footprints, big ones.

32:55.001 --> 32:56.867
- Well, did you see what left them?

32:56.938 --> 32:59.372
- No, but we found this.

32:59.440 --> 33:02.466
- What the hell's that?

33:02.543 --> 33:05.012
- It's what I intend
to find out.

33:08.584 --> 33:10.313
- The advisory is still in effect.

33:10.386 --> 33:11.820
Stay out of the water.

33:11.888 --> 33:13.913
- I better go try to find Jane.

33:14.023 --> 33:15.388
She's probably worried about me.

33:15.458 --> 33:17.756
- I still give you guys a
ride to the mainland

33:17.861 --> 33:19.523
once he opens up the harbor.

33:19.597 --> 33:20.757
- Hey, Jacks.

33:20.865 --> 33:22.162
Wanna come back to the lab with me?

33:22.233 --> 33:23.530
I could use an assistant.

33:23.601 --> 33:26.263
- Uh, sure.
- Great.

33:28.039 --> 33:30.405
- Hey, you still owe me a
refund for that ride, man.

33:30.475 --> 33:33.876
- Hey, I did take you guys out.

33:33.945 --> 33:35.538
You know where to find me.

33:45.292 --> 33:49.388
- Yes, boss? It's me.
I found Slate.

33:49.463 --> 33:54.731
He's with the Marine Biologist.
I'll keep an eye on them.

34:10.587 --> 34:12.885
- I'm not crazy, that's a
big ass egg, right?

34:12.956 --> 34:14.254
- You're not crazy.

34:14.324 --> 34:17.123
But it's time we
should look inside.

34:17.195 --> 34:22.156
( beeping )

34:22.266 --> 34:27.466
- God, what are we lookin' at?

34:27.539 --> 34:29.474
- No, it couldn't be.

34:29.542 --> 34:33.103
This has all the traits of being
some kind of dinosaur!

34:33.179 --> 34:35.079
An ancestor maybe?
I don't know.

34:35.148 --> 34:36.080
- You mean, like the extinct kind?

34:36.149 --> 34:37.617
- Well, not entirely.

34:37.685 --> 34:39.447
I mean, technically
crocodiles are dinosaurs.

34:39.520 --> 34:41.283
Birds too.

34:41.355 --> 34:42.652
- So you're sayin' there's more
of these out there?

34:42.723 --> 34:44.350
- It would seem so.

34:44.458 --> 34:47.360
- And how big do you
think it might be?

34:47.462 --> 34:49.453
- I mean, based on the size
of the footprints

34:49.531 --> 34:51.328
and the fact that it tore
apart two dive boats

34:51.399 --> 34:54.494
like it was nothing, I'd say at
least 40 to 50 feet tall.

34:54.570 --> 34:56.036
But to learn more, we're gonna
have to crack her open.

34:56.138 --> 34:57.765
- Okay. You need some
help with that?

34:57.840 --> 35:00.366
- Just don't break anything. -
Hey, you got any beer?

35:00.477 --> 35:02.172
- Right in the
fridge over there.

35:09.587 --> 35:13.182
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

35:13.258 --> 35:16.626
- It's your beer.
- I mean, from before.

35:16.695 --> 35:19.459
We would have died down there
had it not been for you.

35:19.532 --> 35:21.500
- You wouldn't have been out
there unless it was for me.

35:21.567 --> 35:24.230
- Well, that's true.

35:24.337 --> 35:26.532
Now I want you to make
yourself useful.

35:26.606 --> 35:29.575
Put this on.

35:29.676 --> 35:31.474
- Do you really think all
this is necessary?

35:31.546 --> 35:33.343
- And these gloves.

35:33.414 --> 35:37.316
You've seen "Alien", right? Can
never be too careful.

35:49.232 --> 35:50.722
- Okay, what do you
want me to do?

35:50.800 --> 35:52.165
- That'd be great.

35:52.235 --> 35:53.532
Now I want you to hold it
just like this.

35:53.603 --> 35:56.596
Nice and straight. Very, very,
very gentle.

35:56.707 --> 35:58.334
Nice and steady.

35:58.409 --> 36:00.741
I'm just gonna chip the top.

36:08.553 --> 36:11.045
- Oh, God, that's awful.
what is that?

36:11.123 --> 36:13.091
- It's hydrogen
sulfide and methane.

36:13.159 --> 36:16.458
A bit pungent, but nothing
you can't handle.

36:22.402 --> 36:23.300
( hisses )

36:23.403 --> 36:24.631
Careful. Not too close.

36:24.738 --> 36:25.763
- Come on, it's eyes are closed.

36:25.840 --> 36:27.205
I'm just gonna--

36:27.275 --> 36:28.537
Whoa! Whoa!

36:28.610 --> 36:30.077
- Oh! Oh!

36:30.144 --> 36:31.873
- Bring me the--
- ( growling )

36:31.946 --> 36:33.209
- The what?
- Right behind you.

36:33.282 --> 36:34.306
It's a sedative.
Right behind you.

36:34.416 --> 36:35.713
- Which one?

36:35.784 --> 36:36.876
- It's the one with
the green top.

36:36.952 --> 36:37.884
- Okay?
- Give me three cc's.

36:37.953 --> 36:39.113
- How much is that?

36:39.188 --> 36:41.282
- Just fill it up. Hurry, hurry!

36:41.358 --> 36:45.454
Come on, Jacks!
- Okay, okay!

36:45.528 --> 36:47.393
- Okay, set it down.
- Okay.

36:47.464 --> 36:51.333
- Grab the forceps. One, two,
three.

36:51.435 --> 36:52.663
- Oh!

36:54.772 --> 36:56.604
- Where is it? Where'd it go?

36:56.675 --> 36:58.302
- I don't know.
- Do you see it?

36:58.377 --> 37:00.436
- Jacks, look in the corner by
the file cabinet!

37:00.512 --> 37:01.979
- Where? Where?

37:02.047 --> 37:03.071
- Oh, my God. Just be careful.

37:03.148 --> 37:04.309
- I got it.
- Careful.

37:04.384 --> 37:05.476
- I got it.
- Careful !

37:05.551 --> 37:10.420
- I got it.
- Oh, my God.

37:10.490 --> 37:12.857
I'll get it.

37:12.960 --> 37:14.257
Open the freezer, Jacks.
Open the freezer!

37:14.328 --> 37:15.522
- Okay.

37:17.965 --> 37:21.527
( panting )

37:21.636 --> 37:24.605
- Oh, my God, that was close.

37:35.752 --> 37:38.312
- See, babe? I'm an
honest soul.

37:38.388 --> 37:41.687
- Yeah, right.
Could be worse, though.

37:41.758 --> 37:44.159
- Couldn't get much better,
though, could it?

37:44.228 --> 37:45.160
It's not that bad, is it?

37:45.229 --> 37:46.719
- What are you doing?

37:46.831 --> 37:47.991
- What, babe? I thought you
came here to party.

37:48.066 --> 37:50.695
- I did. I just need
another Mimosa.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.168
- All right, babe. I'll
be right back.

37:52.237 --> 37:53.795
- Thanks.

38:07.621 --> 38:09.179
( reggae music playing )

38:14.963 --> 38:16.430
- Here you go.

38:16.531 --> 38:19.022
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

38:21.471 --> 38:22.563
- Hey, can we stop
for a second?

38:22.638 --> 38:24.367
- What? What's wrong?

38:24.440 --> 38:28.171
Hey, if you wanna go downstairs
to be more private, we can.

38:28.244 --> 38:30.179
- Look, dude, it's just not
gonna happen, okay?

38:30.247 --> 38:34.775
I have a boyfriend. I think
this party's over.

38:34.885 --> 38:37.582
- Party's gotta end sometime,
doesn't it?

38:42.494 --> 38:44.725
( screams )

38:48.901 --> 38:53.362
- Help! Help!

38:53.440 --> 38:54.771
- Oh, great.
- ( screams )

38:54.841 --> 38:56.308
- I guess I'll go.
- Forget it, man.

38:56.409 --> 39:00.107
( screams )

39:00.181 --> 39:02.741
( shouting, screaming )

39:07.923 --> 39:09.220
( shouting )

39:11.827 --> 39:14.455
- Hey, what's goin' on?

39:14.530 --> 39:18.729
Hey, did you see what happened?

39:18.802 --> 39:20.599
Hey, hey, excuse me. Hey,
can I see these?

39:20.670 --> 39:24.072
Thank you, thank you.

39:24.141 --> 39:25.802
What the--?

39:25.876 --> 39:28.504
- It's coming!
- Go, go, go!

39:28.612 --> 39:30.911
( screams )

39:30.982 --> 39:34.975
- Here. Henry!

39:35.053 --> 39:36.452
Man, I need you to get
me out there!

39:36.521 --> 39:38.752
- Sure. Yo, unchock the
boat real quick!

39:38.825 --> 39:40.190
- See the wreckage out there?
The boat?

39:40.293 --> 39:42.420
Get us out there wide open.
Let's go!

39:48.068 --> 39:50.593
Hey, when we get out there,
man, you keep your eyes peeled.

39:50.671 --> 39:52.696
- Look at that.

40:06.055 --> 40:07.682
- Predator X?

40:07.756 --> 40:10.282
- 50 feet long and 100,000 pounds.

40:10.360 --> 40:13.158
Four times more powerful than
the Tyrannosaurus Rex.

40:13.230 --> 40:16.893
But this one had flippers.
It's not our guy.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.060
- Yeah, our guy didn't have flippers.

40:19.170 --> 40:20.364
( shouting )

40:20.438 --> 40:21.666
( screams )

40:21.739 --> 40:23.138
- Hey, take it easy!
Take it easy!

40:23.207 --> 40:24.538
- I blow this bitch head off.
- Slow down!

40:24.609 --> 40:28.546
- I said don't move.

40:33.052 --> 40:37.751
- I never knew you had the
brains for science, Slate.

40:37.857 --> 40:39.552
( panting )

40:39.626 --> 40:40.855
- Where is my gold?

40:40.928 --> 40:42.190
( gasps )

40:42.263 --> 40:43.821
- It's not what you think,
Tariq.

40:43.898 --> 40:46.196
- What I think?

40:46.267 --> 40:49.328
What I think is you got greedy,
diveman.

40:49.404 --> 40:51.065
You saw that gold

40:51.139 --> 40:54.336
and you thought you could just
cut me out of this deal.

40:54.409 --> 40:55.740
Again!

40:55.810 --> 40:57.574
- It's not like that, okay?

40:57.647 --> 40:58.944
A lot of weird stuff's
been going on.

40:59.048 --> 41:00.538
A lot of people have
been dying lately.

41:00.616 --> 41:05.850
- You're right about that.

41:05.923 --> 41:07.515
Tell me where the gold is.

41:07.591 --> 41:12.029
and I might let your woman
live for a while.

41:12.096 --> 41:15.793
( shrieks )

41:15.900 --> 41:19.359
- It's in the fridge.

41:19.438 --> 41:22.407
- Check it!

41:26.946 --> 41:30.246
Careful. It might be a trick.

41:35.856 --> 41:36.788
( growls )

41:36.857 --> 41:38.620
( screams )

41:38.693 --> 41:40.092
( gunfire )

41:40.161 --> 41:42.391
( shouting, growling )

41:42.464 --> 41:45.456
- Kill it! Shoot it!

41:45.534 --> 41:50.302
Kill it!

41:50.373 --> 41:51.840
Damn you, Slate!

41:51.941 --> 41:53.636
You'll never make it off
this island alive!

41:57.480 --> 41:59.244
( growls )

41:59.316 --> 42:01.477
( screams )

42:01.552 --> 42:02.951
- Go, go.
- Go!

42:20.506 --> 42:23.032
- Do you see her?

42:23.143 --> 42:24.701
Do you see her?

42:30.051 --> 42:34.818
Jane! Jane, Jane?

42:36.658 --> 42:38.353
Oh, my God!

42:40.763 --> 42:42.958
You'll be all right, Jane.
Jane?

43:04.389 --> 43:07.153
Goddamn it!

43:11.964 --> 43:15.992
- Sorry, man, she's gone.

43:16.070 --> 43:19.039
She's gone.

43:27.082 --> 43:29.016
- I'm sorry about your girlfriend.

43:29.084 --> 43:31.246
We should be safe enough
here at the docks.

43:31.320 --> 43:33.379
But we're dealing with something
pretty lethal out there.

43:33.456 --> 43:36.357
- I saw that thing's arms and
head sticking out of the water.

43:36.425 --> 43:41.022
It's a goddamned monster.

43:41.098 --> 43:42.793
So what do we do now?

43:42.899 --> 43:44.526
- I don't know.

43:44.601 --> 43:45.932
Those little ones are like
gremlins from hell, though.

43:46.002 --> 43:47.129
- And they won't stay
little for long.

43:47.238 --> 43:48.967
You're right.

43:49.073 --> 43:51.405
We should have destroyed those
eggs while we had the chance.

43:51.476 --> 43:52.966
- How many of those eggs
were down there?

43:53.077 --> 43:55.638
- Two dozen.
- Oh, my God.

43:55.747 --> 43:57.476
If just one of those things can
do that to a sailboat,

43:57.583 --> 43:59.210
can you imagine what two
dozen are gonna do?

43:59.284 --> 44:01.776
- Yeah, or how long before they
become 200 or 200,000?

44:01.855 --> 44:05.256
- We gotta do something
right here right now.

44:05.325 --> 44:07.725
Or else we're gonna be
dealing with--

44:07.794 --> 44:10.764
- A new apex predator, the top
of the food chain.

44:10.831 --> 44:12.662
And the end of our time
as a species.

44:12.766 --> 44:17.431
- We gotta destroy those eggs.

44:17.506 --> 44:18.632
All right, guys. We're headed
back out to the hole.

44:18.707 --> 44:19.935
Let's go!

44:20.008 --> 44:21.635
- Hey, guys, get ready.
Let's go!

44:29.118 --> 44:31.143
- So how come we never seen
this thing before?

44:31.220 --> 44:32.984
- I think we have.

44:33.056 --> 44:35.581
Nautical tales of sea monsters
are as old as humanity itself.

44:35.659 --> 44:37.126
Who khows what's out there?

44:37.194 --> 44:39.754
I mean, for all we know, a
Poseidon Rex could have

44:39.830 --> 44:40.991
been hibernating forthe
past 400 years

44:41.065 --> 44:42.828
or even the last 400,000.

44:42.901 --> 44:45.199
Maybe nobody ever saw
it and lived.

44:45.303 --> 44:46.964
Like the crew of the Cortez.

44:47.038 --> 44:48.267
- Wait. What did you call it?

44:48.340 --> 44:50.968
- Poseidon Rex,
the 'King of the Ocean'.

44:51.043 --> 44:52.635
Just like the T-Rex was
king of the land.

44:52.711 --> 44:55.977
P-Rex ruled the sea, only
bigger and stronger.

44:56.049 --> 44:58.643
- So you get to name it?
- Perk of the job.

44:58.718 --> 45:02.984
- King of the sea, huh?
We'll see about that.

45:03.056 --> 45:04.718
- Make no mistake.

45:04.825 --> 45:06.383
P-Rex may have been one of the
most fearsome creatures

45:06.494 --> 45:07.984
to ever walk the earth.

45:08.062 --> 45:10.121
Or swim the earth anyway.

45:10.198 --> 45:12.565
- Okay. So how do we
kill this thing?

45:12.668 --> 45:14.693
- Well, even P-Rex is
just an animal.

45:14.770 --> 45:16.863
It bleeds like anything else.

45:16.939 --> 45:19.170
- So we get guns, right?

45:47.406 --> 45:49.101
- Uh, I'm picking up something.

45:49.208 --> 45:54.044
Jacks.

45:54.114 --> 45:58.074
- It's probably just the reef.
It means we're getting close.

46:00.288 --> 46:01.846
- There's something coming up
beneath us!

46:01.923 --> 46:03.288
Something really, really big!

46:03.391 --> 46:07.726
- Look alive on those guns!

46:07.796 --> 46:11.926
- It's coming in fast!
It's almost here.

46:12.001 --> 46:14.061
- Where is it now?

46:14.137 --> 46:16.230
- It's underneath us!

46:18.608 --> 46:20.132
- Full reverse!

46:20.243 --> 46:23.577
- Hold on!

46:23.648 --> 46:24.979
( growls )

46:25.082 --> 46:26.709
- Open fire!

46:26.784 --> 46:29.549
- ( gunfire )
- My God.

46:29.621 --> 46:31.612
- Fire at its head!

46:31.690 --> 46:33.624
( gunfire )

46:37.297 --> 46:39.265
- Amazing.

46:44.538 --> 46:46.301
- I'm out!

46:46.373 --> 46:49.638
- Reload!

46:49.710 --> 46:51.177
- I'm not seeing anything.

46:51.278 --> 46:52.439
- Well, I think we got him.

46:52.514 --> 46:54.243
- I think we just pissed it off.

46:54.316 --> 46:58.150
- There's no way it survived
all that.

46:58.219 --> 47:01.951
- I've got something. I think
it's back!

47:02.024 --> 47:05.425
Oh, my God, Henry!

47:05.494 --> 47:06.518
Henry!

47:08.231 --> 47:09.596
Henry!

47:09.666 --> 47:11.099
- Spare me!

47:11.168 --> 47:12.658
No!

47:12.736 --> 47:15.706
- No!

47:20.645 --> 47:21.703
( growls )

47:21.813 --> 47:25.181
- Jesus.

47:25.250 --> 47:27.309
- Take us over there!

47:38.064 --> 47:43.560
( roars )

47:43.671 --> 47:45.536
- Guys, that's not
gonna kill it!

47:52.414 --> 47:53.540
- Yeah!

47:53.615 --> 47:54.844
- Yeah! I hit it!

47:54.917 --> 47:55.884
- Great job, Jacks!

47:55.952 --> 47:57.852
- Well done! Good job!

47:57.920 --> 47:59.547
- Yeah, man!

47:59.622 --> 48:03.354
- Whoa!

48:06.130 --> 48:10.261
- Jacks, we're being dragged!

48:10.368 --> 48:11.892
Pull the lever!

48:11.970 --> 48:13.335
- Jacks, get on it!

48:13.405 --> 48:15.373
- It's gonna pull us under!

48:21.113 --> 48:22.774
Pull the lever!

48:27.821 --> 48:29.846
Hold on!

48:32.492 --> 48:34.188
( shrieks )

48:44.339 --> 48:47.274
Oh, God! Oh!

48:47.342 --> 48:49.208
- Let's get back to the dock!

48:49.279 --> 48:52.077
- Oh, that was close.
- Let's get off the water, huh?

49:08.533 --> 49:10.467
- This place looks like
a ghost town.

49:10.535 --> 49:12.970
- Yeah. That tends to
happen when people

49:13.039 --> 49:15.667
see a prehistoric monster come
out of the water.

49:15.775 --> 49:17.265
- They got to get the hell
off the island.

49:17.343 --> 49:19.107
- So you're gonna call in
the cavalry, right?

49:19.179 --> 49:21.977
- We'll bring enough fire power to
send it back to the ice age.

49:22.049 --> 49:24.244
- Cretaceous period, actually.

49:24.318 --> 49:27.254
It, uh--
( sighs )

49:27.322 --> 49:28.949
Never mind. It doesn't matter.

49:29.023 --> 49:30.957
Just don't forget those eggs
are still out there.

49:31.025 --> 49:32.856
- We'll nuke the goddamn
hole if we have to.

49:32.961 --> 49:34.930
- What about us?

49:34.997 --> 49:38.091
- I suggest you people hide.

49:38.167 --> 49:39.794
- Just be careful.

49:39.869 --> 49:42.600
- I think he knows better than
to come after us again.

49:42.672 --> 49:44.333
Okay, guys, let's go.

49:55.853 --> 49:57.845
( roars, screaming )

49:59.758 --> 50:01.157
( shouts )

50:04.563 --> 50:05.861
- Guys, let's get the
hell outta here.

50:05.932 --> 50:07.229
- Don't worry, guys.

50:07.333 --> 50:08.732
This is the one place
we're safe.

50:08.835 --> 50:09.961
I mean, P-rex rules the water,
not the land.

50:10.036 --> 50:13.130
- You sure about that?

50:13.206 --> 50:14.868
- On second thought, maybe
we'd better run.

50:14.942 --> 50:15.909
Definitely run.

50:16.010 --> 50:17.307
- Run! Come on, let's go!

50:17.378 --> 50:19.676
Move, move, move!
Everybody run!

50:19.747 --> 50:22.376
Get out!

50:25.921 --> 50:28.857
- Hey, here!
- Come on, go, go, go.

50:30.259 --> 50:32.693
( roars )

50:38.101 --> 50:40.535
- This is unbelievable.

50:40.604 --> 50:42.595
- Oh, my God!

50:42.706 --> 50:44.196
Upload the footage.

50:44.275 --> 50:45.537
People need to know what's
happening here.

50:45.610 --> 50:46.542
Someone must have signaled
for help.

50:46.611 --> 50:47.543
It should be coming, right?

50:47.612 --> 50:48.874
- I don't know.

50:48.947 --> 50:50.608
I kinda think we're on our own.

50:50.715 --> 50:52.775
We need to get outta here
before that thing comes back.

50:52.885 --> 50:54.443
- And go where?

50:54.553 --> 50:56.350
- At Henry's boat. It's
just on the dock.

50:56.422 --> 50:58.049
- It's 40 miles to the mainland.
You wanna take that chance?

50:58.123 --> 50:59.716
- Guys, there's an old
military base

50:59.793 --> 51:00.885
on the other side of the
island past the town.

51:00.961 --> 51:04.556
We could hide there.

51:04.631 --> 51:06.895
- All right. I'll try
and distract it.

51:06.967 --> 51:09.198
You guys make your way to
the car, okay?

51:09.270 --> 51:10.862
- Good luck.

51:13.341 --> 51:16.209
- Hey!

51:16.278 --> 51:17.802
Hey, over here!

51:17.913 --> 51:21.974
Hey, ugly! Come and get me!

51:22.084 --> 51:25.577
Come on, you old reptile!

51:25.655 --> 51:28.055
( roars )

51:28.124 --> 51:29.250
Go! Go, go, go!

51:29.325 --> 51:31.089
- Okay, come on, come on!

51:48.147 --> 51:49.307
- No keys!

51:49.382 --> 51:52.408
- What?
- Look for keys.

51:52.485 --> 51:55.182
- Check the body!

51:55.288 --> 51:57.153
- Keys, keys.

51:57.224 --> 51:59.590
Got 'em, got 'em!

51:59.660 --> 52:02.095
- Got 'em? Let's go, let's go!

52:02.163 --> 52:04.188
- No. We're not leaving
without Jacks!

52:04.298 --> 52:06.357
No. He'll be back any minute!

52:06.467 --> 52:08.332
Jacks? Jacks?

52:08.403 --> 52:12.932
Jacks, let's go!

52:13.008 --> 52:14.168
- Slate!

52:14.243 --> 52:17.475
- Tariq? You're, uh...

52:17.547 --> 52:20.983
- Alive?

52:21.051 --> 52:23.349
No thanks to you, Slate.

52:23.420 --> 52:24.717
Where is my gold?

52:24.822 --> 52:27.222
- We're goin' to get
it right now.

52:27.324 --> 52:28.723
- Yeah?

52:28.826 --> 52:32.661
Now I get my gold and my revenge.

52:32.731 --> 52:36.895
But before I do,

52:37.002 --> 52:39.402
I want to kill you!

52:43.109 --> 52:44.633
( crunching )

52:44.711 --> 52:47.373
- Get in, let's go, let's go!
Come on, drive!

52:51.685 --> 52:52.845
That was close.

52:52.920 --> 52:55.013
Nice driving for a
marine biologist.

52:55.089 --> 52:57.558
- We just follow this road for
a couple more miles.

52:57.625 --> 52:58.922
- Yeah. I just wanna make
one more stop.

52:59.027 --> 53:01.928
- Where?
- Guess we'll find out.

53:20.818 --> 53:25.278
- What is this place?
- Compound of Tariq's.

53:25.389 --> 53:27.085
- You mean the guy that just
tried to kill us?

53:27.159 --> 53:28.183
- Yep.

53:28.260 --> 53:30.421
- So why would you
take us here?

53:50.952 --> 53:54.285
- Oh, shit.
- That's why.

53:54.356 --> 53:58.157
- Man, now that's more like it.

53:58.261 --> 54:00.491
- I don't think we've seen the
last of that thing.

54:00.596 --> 54:05.591
I don't know about you, but I'm
not much for hiding.

54:05.669 --> 54:09.628
I say we ought to kill that
thing or die trying.

54:09.706 --> 54:11.606
- Oh, we're gonna kill it.

54:42.877 --> 54:45.278
( roars )

54:45.347 --> 54:47.144
- We got company!

54:47.216 --> 54:50.344
- Shoot it!
- Oh, my God, get it!

54:50.419 --> 54:52.217
( gunfire )

55:05.269 --> 55:08.637
( screams )

55:08.707 --> 55:10.538
( tires squeal )

55:11.910 --> 55:13.707
- Everybody out! Let's go!

55:13.778 --> 55:15.974
- Run! We can lose him
in the woods!

55:16.048 --> 55:17.675
( gunfire )

55:28.262 --> 55:32.199
( growling )

55:32.267 --> 55:33.199
- Go, go, go, go!

55:33.268 --> 55:34.428
Go, go!

55:34.535 --> 55:36.696
- Jacks! What the hell
are you doing?

55:36.771 --> 55:38.569
- Do what I ask and go!

55:38.641 --> 55:40.939
- Let's go! We gotta move!

55:54.058 --> 55:59.018
- Careful !

55:59.096 --> 56:01.291
- We're not gonna outrun it!

56:01.399 --> 56:04.801
It's too fast, too big!
Just keep going!

56:10.109 --> 56:11.974
In here! In here! Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

56:12.078 --> 56:14.706
- Come on!

56:14.781 --> 56:16.078
- It's coming.

56:19.320 --> 56:20.787
- Quiet.

56:20.854 --> 56:23.254
- Don't move a muscle.

56:23.324 --> 56:24.883
( growling )

56:42.145 --> 56:44.773
- It's gone.

56:47.284 --> 56:49.116
- How much farther do you
think that base is?

56:49.187 --> 56:53.453
- Not more than a mile or so.

56:53.524 --> 56:55.014
- Come on. Let's keep moving.

56:55.126 --> 56:56.287
Let's go.

57:18.319 --> 57:19.810
( growls )

57:23.358 --> 57:24.825
- How old is this place?

57:24.893 --> 57:26.360
- I don't know. It doesn't matter.

57:26.428 --> 57:27.726
Hopefully, we can get a
signal out from inside

57:27.830 --> 57:28.990
and call for help.

57:29.065 --> 57:30.896
- At the very least, a
place to hide.

57:54.293 --> 57:57.023
- This place should be running
on its own grid.

57:57.096 --> 57:58.724
- Oh, this place gives
me the creeps.

57:58.799 --> 58:01.666
- Well, safer in here than
out there, right?

58:01.735 --> 58:04.203
- I guess.
- So what are we looking for?

58:04.271 --> 58:05.864
- Power.

58:14.049 --> 58:15.448
Jackpot.

58:15.551 --> 58:16.848
- You think you'll get it
up and running?

58:16.919 --> 58:19.410
- We'll see.

58:25.295 --> 58:28.264
- I'll be back. I'm gonna go
check things out.

58:40.078 --> 58:42.546
- Where'd you run off to?
- Found the armory.

58:42.614 --> 58:44.947
- Did you find anything?
- Oh, yeah.

58:45.017 --> 58:48.976
Grenades, rocket launchers,
you name it.

58:53.427 --> 58:54.325
( gasps )

58:54.428 --> 58:55.918
- You did it!

58:55.996 --> 58:57.395
- I'm not sure how
long it'll last.

58:57.464 --> 58:58.556
Let's see if we can
find a radio.

58:58.632 --> 59:01.500
- Great.
- Okay.

59:01.603 --> 59:05.835
- This thing looks ancient.
- It is.

59:05.940 --> 59:08.774
This is Jackson Slate on
the Ambergris Key.

59:08.844 --> 59:11.813
We are alone and we're
in trouble.

59:11.881 --> 59:16.342
Anyone out there, please
respond. Over.

59:16.453 --> 59:18.944
Anyone out there read me? Over.

59:23.394 --> 59:28.764
Anyone out there? Over.

59:28.833 --> 59:30.425
This is Jacks Slate of
Ambergris Key.

59:30.502 --> 59:32.436
We are alone and in trouble.

59:32.504 --> 59:35.598
Anyone out there copy this,
get back. Over.

59:44.217 --> 59:46.686
I gotta assume we're still alone.

59:46.754 --> 59:49.552
Found a two-seater airplane in
the hangar next door.

59:49.657 --> 59:53.024
If no help comes in the morning,
I'll fly that thing outta here.

59:53.093 --> 59:55.392
- What if it comes back before then?

59:55.497 --> 01:00:01.197
- Well, then we'll give it hell.

01:00:01.269 --> 01:00:05.366
Get some rest. I'll keep watch.

01:00:26.432 --> 01:00:29.868
- Sure you wanna stay out
here all by yourself?

01:00:54.596 --> 01:00:57.088
( chuckles )

01:01:10.981 --> 01:01:12.279
( giggles )

01:01:50.327 --> 01:01:52.022
- Let me know as soon--

01:01:52.128 --> 01:01:53.857
Got it? I don't care
what it takes.

01:01:53.963 --> 01:01:55.362
What's goin' on, Private?

01:01:55.465 --> 01:01:57.262
- Sir, something's strange.

01:01:57.334 --> 01:01:59.929
I received a transmission on an
old military band,

01:02:00.004 --> 01:02:01.972
one that hasn't been used
in over 30 years.

01:02:02.039 --> 01:02:03.939
- That is strange.

01:02:04.008 --> 01:02:06.443
- Actually, that's not even
the strange part.

01:02:06.511 --> 01:02:09.105
- Where did it originate from?

01:02:09.181 --> 01:02:12.116
- Ambergris Key, the old
military base over there.

01:02:12.184 --> 01:02:14.380
- That outpost has been abandoned
for decades.

01:02:14.487 --> 01:02:15.715
What did it say?

01:02:15.822 --> 01:02:19.849
- Actually, sir, you
won't believe this.

01:02:25.733 --> 01:02:28.532
- What the--?

01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:36.511
- So how does one get
in the business

01:02:36.579 --> 01:02:38.740
of treasure hunting?

01:02:38.848 --> 01:02:42.477
- I think getting in is easy.

01:02:42.551 --> 01:02:44.747
It's the getting out part
that's hard.

01:02:44.855 --> 01:02:46.516
- Oh, I've noticed.

01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:48.023
( chuckles )

01:02:48.091 --> 01:02:49.058
- And how did you end up
mixed up with a guy

01:02:49.126 --> 01:02:50.491
like Tariq anyway?

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:55.089
- Tariq?

01:02:55.199 --> 01:02:58.327
I don't think you can say what
I do is exactly legal.

01:02:58.403 --> 01:03:00.895
So sometimes you need somebody
that knows

01:03:00.973 --> 01:03:04.409
the ins and outs of a country, right?

01:03:04.476 --> 01:03:07.503
- And I take it you probably
won't be turning

01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:10.947
any of that gold into the local
government or museum?

01:03:11.050 --> 01:03:13.518
- Would you?

01:03:13.586 --> 01:03:15.452
- Hmm.

01:03:15.556 --> 01:03:16.955
- So what about you?

01:03:17.057 --> 01:03:18.456
If you're not motivated
by money,

01:03:18.559 --> 01:03:20.857
I mean, you're obviously not
motivated by danger.

01:03:20.928 --> 01:03:24.888
- Hey, there's plenty of
danger in what I do.

01:03:24.966 --> 01:03:25.898
( chuckles )

01:03:25.967 --> 01:03:27.093
Jellyfish sting, you know.

01:03:27.169 --> 01:03:28.796
- A jellyfish, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

01:03:28.904 --> 01:03:30.634
Well, the Immortal Jellyfish,
to be exact.

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.367
They live in the Blue Hole.

01:03:32.442 --> 01:03:35.377
I've been studying them for
the past three years.

01:03:35.445 --> 01:03:39.109
Do you have any idea
what you've done, by the way?

01:03:39.183 --> 01:03:41.378
By setting off those explosives,

01:03:41.452 --> 01:03:43.283
you've done irreparable damage
to their habitat.

01:03:43.353 --> 01:03:44.820
- Hey, slow down, okay?

01:03:44.922 --> 01:03:46.288
I think finding a ship
that's been missing

01:03:46.357 --> 01:03:48.416
for over 400 years is a
little more important

01:03:48.493 --> 01:03:49.755
than some jellyfish.

01:03:49.828 --> 01:03:52.422
- Oh, these jellyfish
live forever.

01:03:52.497 --> 01:03:55.160
- Forever?
- As in immortal.

01:03:55.267 --> 01:03:56.461
They never die.

01:03:56.535 --> 01:03:57.729
They may hold the key
to unlocking

01:03:57.803 --> 01:03:59.293
the secret of human immortality.

01:03:59.371 --> 01:04:01.840
Oh, I was just scratching
the surface of

01:04:01.942 --> 01:04:03.739
all the secrets the Blue Hole
may have been hiding.

01:04:03.810 --> 01:04:06.335
- So you don't think that thing,

01:04:06.446 --> 01:04:12.010
that Poseidon Rex, is
immortal as well, do you?

01:04:12.119 --> 01:04:16.249
- I don't really know
at this point.

01:04:16.324 --> 01:04:18.122
( radio static )

01:04:22.831 --> 01:04:26.029
- What are you doing?
- This place is so old.

01:04:26.135 --> 01:04:27.796
I figured they'd have this
stuff laying around.

01:04:27.871 --> 01:04:30.169
And I was right.
- What is it?

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:32.937
- A telegraph.

01:04:33.010 --> 01:04:36.776
- Morse Code? Who you
trying to reach?

01:04:36.847 --> 01:04:40.477
- There.
- The jungle?

01:04:40.552 --> 01:04:43.487
- No. It's a U.S. Army base.

01:04:43.555 --> 01:04:48.220
- How do you know it's there? -
Trust me. It's there.

01:04:48.327 --> 01:04:49.885
- So now what?

01:04:49.996 --> 01:04:53.523
- Now we wait.

01:04:53.599 --> 01:04:55.123
- Okay. Well, what'd
you tell 'em?

01:04:55.201 --> 01:04:56.635
- I told them that a 50-foot
sea monster

01:04:56.703 --> 01:04:58.295
was attacking the island,
killing everybody

01:04:58.372 --> 01:05:00.499
and that they needed to do
something about it.

01:05:00.574 --> 01:05:02.235
- Yeah, I'm sure they're gonna
take that seriously, huh?

01:05:02.342 --> 01:05:03.310
- Well, it was worth a shot.

01:05:03.378 --> 01:05:05.039
( static )

01:05:05.113 --> 01:05:06.045
- Wait a minute.
What's that sound?

01:05:06.114 --> 01:05:09.015
- ( beeping ) - Shh!

01:05:16.625 --> 01:05:18.388
You're not gonna like it.

01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:21.225
They got your message last night.

01:05:21.298 --> 01:05:23.391
They have satellite imaging
of the creature

01:05:23.466 --> 01:05:25.696
and are tracking it now.

01:05:25.769 --> 01:05:27.397
We have to be off the island
in 20 minutes.

01:05:27.471 --> 01:05:29.564
- Why? What happens in 20 minutes?

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:33.201
- It's gonna be an all-out
aerial assault.

01:05:33.277 --> 01:05:35.041
They're gonna level
the whole thing.

01:05:35.113 --> 01:05:36.080
- What are you talking about?

01:05:36.148 --> 01:05:37.410
There's still people here!

01:05:37.482 --> 01:05:39.177
- What are we gonna do?

01:05:39.251 --> 01:05:42.085
- The airplane.

01:05:42.155 --> 01:05:44.214
- But it only fits two people.

01:05:44.290 --> 01:05:47.885
- Yeah, well, only one of
us is going up.

01:05:47.961 --> 01:05:49.053
You guys get down to the pier.

01:05:49.128 --> 01:05:50.892
I'll try and distract it.

01:05:53.567 --> 01:05:57.264
- One, two, three, four.

01:05:57.338 --> 01:05:58.567
- You still have eyes
on the creature?

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.073
- Yes, sir.

01:06:00.141 --> 01:06:01.540
It's still rampaging the
entire island.

01:06:01.610 --> 01:06:03.908
- Bring it up on the monitors, please.

01:06:03.979 --> 01:06:07.143
Zoom. Closer.

01:06:07.249 --> 01:06:10.377
My God!

01:06:13.657 --> 01:06:16.387
- Sir, you won't believe this.

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:18.553
I just received a message from
the civilians at the base.

01:06:18.629 --> 01:06:21.064
The ones from last night.
Morse Code.

01:06:21.132 --> 01:06:22.724
They're still alive.

01:06:22.834 --> 01:06:25.803
- I hope you told them they got
less than 20 minutes

01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:29.136
to get out of that area before
I glass the whole damn thing.

01:06:29.208 --> 01:06:31.073
- Sir, we have to give them
time to escape.

01:06:31.143 --> 01:06:34.977
- I can't let that thing
get off the island.

01:06:35.047 --> 01:06:39.508
Let's hope your friends can.

01:06:39.619 --> 01:06:41.348
Proceed.

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:02.777
- Come on, give me a hand!

01:07:02.845 --> 01:07:06.872
Slide it open.

01:07:06.983 --> 01:07:08.281
That's it.

01:07:15.894 --> 01:07:17.191
( panting )

01:07:18.897 --> 01:07:21.058
- Come on, come on, come on.

01:07:21.166 --> 01:07:22.794
- It needs fuel!

01:07:22.868 --> 01:07:27.328
Grab the stepladder over there!

01:07:27.406 --> 01:07:29.306
Try on top.

01:07:29.375 --> 01:07:30.843
Right on top, right up here,
right up here!

01:07:30.911 --> 01:07:32.037
Okay!

01:07:32.112 --> 01:07:33.511
All right, give me some slack!

01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:36.913
All right. Once he gets it in,
just pump, okay?

01:07:37.017 --> 01:07:39.987
- Okay, ready? Ready?

01:07:40.054 --> 01:07:43.421
- Go, go.

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:49.520
Come on!

01:07:49.598 --> 01:07:51.031
Come on! We need more!

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:52.032
- I'm pumping as hard and
fast as I can!

01:07:52.101 --> 01:07:53.568
( growls )

01:07:53.636 --> 01:07:58.039
- Guys? Guys? It's back!
That's it!

01:07:58.108 --> 01:08:01.077
- All right, get out of here!
Get out of here!

01:08:01.144 --> 01:08:03.045
- Be careful, Jacks.

01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:07.608
- Get off this island!

01:08:25.839 --> 01:08:27.932
( growls )

01:08:30.944 --> 01:08:33.709
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Let's go!

01:08:47.831 --> 01:08:49.765
Let's go, let's go, get
the bow line!

01:09:14.627 --> 01:09:16.117
( roars )

01:09:22.670 --> 01:09:25.366
- Come on, you bastard,
follow me.

01:09:29.644 --> 01:09:31.703
- Come on, come on, come on!

01:09:31.813 --> 01:09:33.542
( growls )

01:09:39.488 --> 01:09:43.858
- T minus five minutes
to destination.

01:09:43.926 --> 01:09:45.053
- Copy that, Gold Leader.

01:09:45.162 --> 01:09:46.390
You are weapons free if you can

01:09:46.496 --> 01:09:48.828
make visual contact with the target.

01:09:58.010 --> 01:10:00.342
- Go! Light it up, light it up!

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:03.213
( gunfire )

01:10:07.053 --> 01:10:08.987
- Keep shooting! Keep shooting!

01:10:09.055 --> 01:10:10.579
- The son of a bitch won't die!

01:10:10.690 --> 01:10:12.157
- Pilot, please identify yourself.

01:10:12.225 --> 01:10:14.751
- Hey, it's Jackson Slate.
Who's this?

01:10:14.862 --> 01:10:16.853
- You are ordered to leave
this airspace at once.

01:10:16.931 --> 01:10:18.159
- Now listen here!

01:10:18.232 --> 01:10:19.756
I'm the one that called the S.O.S.

01:10:19.867 --> 01:10:22.029
The goddamned monster's been
attacking the island!

01:10:22.104 --> 01:10:23.935
- Come here! Take the wheel !

01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:29.942
- Get it, Rod! Get it!

01:10:30.046 --> 01:10:31.946
Be careful, Rod!

01:10:32.048 --> 01:10:33.379
( roars )

01:10:38.989 --> 01:10:40.513
- Whoa!

01:10:40.591 --> 01:10:42.388
- You are ordered to
immediately leave the area

01:10:42.459 --> 01:10:44.519
before aerial
bombardment commences.

01:10:44.596 --> 01:10:46.962
- There's still people
on the island!

01:10:54.006 --> 01:10:55.371
The creature's not on
land anymore.

01:10:55.441 --> 01:10:56.874
It's in the water.

01:10:56.943 --> 01:10:59.811
- Lieutenant, have 'em
paint the target.

01:10:59.913 --> 01:11:01.813
- We're tracking your position.

01:11:01.915 --> 01:11:05.544
If you continue to paint the
target, we can get a lock.

01:11:05.619 --> 01:11:08.953
Do you understand, Mr. Slate?

01:11:09.023 --> 01:11:11.617
- I do.

01:11:15.597 --> 01:11:17.428
- Gold Leader, the Cessna 22
will paint the target.

01:11:17.499 --> 01:11:20.059
Lock onto his transponder signal.

01:11:20.135 --> 01:11:21.261
- Affirmative.

01:11:21.337 --> 01:11:22.828
( roars )

01:11:34.352 --> 01:11:35.683
- Oh!

01:11:35.786 --> 01:11:36.912
( screams )

01:11:36.988 --> 01:11:38.479
- No!

01:11:38.557 --> 01:11:40.149
( screams )

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.026
- Raptor's are nearly in
visual range, sir.

01:11:53.172 --> 01:11:56.199
T minus 30 seconds.

01:12:16.599 --> 01:12:18.898
( growls )

01:12:24.709 --> 01:12:26.643
- Direct hit!
The creature is down!

01:12:26.711 --> 01:12:28.235
- Yes!

01:12:28.346 --> 01:12:30.337
- I repeat, the creature is down.

01:12:30.415 --> 01:12:31.746
- I want a cleanup team in
there immediately.

01:12:31.849 --> 01:12:33.715
Good job, good job.

01:12:33.786 --> 01:12:35.686
- What about Slate?

01:12:42.929 --> 01:12:44.260
( growls )

01:12:44.364 --> 01:12:45.661
- Sir, it's back!

01:12:45.732 --> 01:12:48.258
- No! No, it's impossible!

01:12:48.369 --> 01:12:49.734
- Look!

01:13:07.890 --> 01:13:12.385
- Yeah.

01:13:12.463 --> 01:13:14.090
( screams )

01:13:21.139 --> 01:13:22.766
- Woo!

01:13:22.841 --> 01:13:27.802
- Yes! Yes!

01:13:27.913 --> 01:13:30.814
( pants )

01:13:57.179 --> 01:13:58.977
- Hey, there.

01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:03.984
- You're alive.

01:14:04.053 --> 01:14:05.851
Jacks.

01:14:09.727 --> 01:14:11.786
- How would you like a vacation?

01:14:11.862 --> 01:14:13.330
- How about a different island?

01:14:13.398 --> 01:14:17.664
- Sounds good to me.

01:14:17.736 --> 01:14:19.431
- Aren't we forgetting something?

01:14:19.504 --> 01:14:20.802
- The gold?

01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:24.809
- No. I mean the eggs.

01:14:44.733 --> 01:14:48.829
( rustling )

01:14:48.904 --> 01:14:50.735
( growls )
