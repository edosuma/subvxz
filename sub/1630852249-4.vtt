WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.360
I've tried, sweetheart, but he's not
going to budge on this one.

00:05.360 --> 00:08.360
But mother, I've worked awfully hard
this term.

00:08.360 --> 00:11.400
Please ask Daddy not to stop
my pocket money.

00:11.400 --> 00:14.120
I'm sorry. Imagine what it will look
like to the other girls

00:14.120 --> 00:16.480
if I can't afford to buy
treats in the village.

00:16.480 --> 00:19.440
He says I'm too soft on you and he's
taking matters into his own hands.

00:19.440 --> 00:20.680
Mother, I must dash.

00:20.680 --> 00:23.480
Please tell Daddy I intend to do
all I can to make him proud of me.

00:23.480 --> 00:26.280
That's right, darling. Make us
proud.

00:26.280 --> 00:28.320
Bye, mother. Bye-bye.

00:28.320 --> 00:32.400
Studious young ladies do not have
time for morning telephone calls,
Gwendoline.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.800
I'm sorry, Mademoiselle, but
it was an important family matter.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.240
Hm.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.680
The Summit of Love.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.760
A play about Lady Jane Malory.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.080
How exciting.

01:03.680 --> 01:06.160
You're Georgina Thomas, aren't you?

01:06.160 --> 01:07.800
I'm Gwendoline Mary Lacey.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.440
Pleased to meet you. Charmed.

01:10.920 --> 01:14.080
Are you acting in this? Directing,
actually.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.760
Oh, of course,

01:15.760 --> 01:19.320
a far more important role for
a sixth former, like yourself.

01:19.320 --> 01:22.440
Miss Grayling practically begged me
to put this on for open day.

01:22.440 --> 01:24.200
It's going to be spectacular.

01:25.880 --> 01:29.200
Georgina, could I read for a part?

01:29.200 --> 01:32.480
I'd really love to work with you,
and I'd do anything to help.

01:34.320 --> 01:36.040
Auditions are at 2:00
this afternoon.

01:36.040 --> 01:39.200
Be a darling and put one of these up
for me in your common room, please.

02:06.800 --> 02:09.840
GIRLS CHATTER

02:13.760 --> 02:15.560
Is this what Mr Parker was talking
about?

02:15.560 --> 02:17.120
Anyone know who's directing?

02:17.120 --> 02:18.440
Georgina Thomas.

02:18.440 --> 02:20.560
I heard she's quite the talent.

02:20.560 --> 02:23.320
It says here to audition in pairs.

02:23.320 --> 02:26.440
One is Lady Jane and the other's
Highwayman Jack.

02:26.440 --> 02:27.840
What fun.

02:27.840 --> 02:29.800
So who wants to be my Jack?

02:30.840 --> 02:34.120
Alicia, would you like to pair up?

02:34.120 --> 02:35.600
Why I'd love to, Jean. Thank you!

02:36.840 --> 02:38.040
Irene?

02:38.040 --> 02:42.560
Oh, as it happens, Georgina asked me
to do the music, so not me. Sorry.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.600
How about it, Helen?

02:47.760 --> 02:49.440
You're better off with someone else.

02:49.440 --> 02:51.320
I've never acted before.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.760
Sorry, Gwen.

02:55.640 --> 02:57.240
Sally, will you audition with me?

02:57.240 --> 03:00.000
I get stage fright, sorry.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.080
Darrell, you'd make
a smashing highway man.

03:03.080 --> 03:05.240
You're already so boyish.

03:09.600 --> 03:13.560
Things are so difficult for me
at home at the moment.

03:13.560 --> 03:17.400
I'm desperate to impress my parents.
This is such a great opportunity.

03:17.400 --> 03:20.040
All right. All right, I'll do it.
Marvellous.

03:20.040 --> 03:22.960
Auditions are at two.
We'll have to practise beforehand.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.880
So see you in the dorm at break.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.400
"I love you, my dearest,
with all of my heart.

03:35.400 --> 03:38.120
"I bury our future too soon,
we must part.

03:38.120 --> 03:41.520
"My wealth, I'll abandon,
my father, I'll cross.

03:41.520 --> 03:44.760
"It's you that I win,
so I count it no loss."

03:44.760 --> 03:46.960
Goodness, Mr Parker, did you really
write that?

03:46.960 --> 03:48.040
I wrote the play,

03:48.040 --> 03:52.240
but that is the poem Lady Jane sent
to her lover, Highwayman Jack.

03:52.240 --> 03:54.560
It's from her diary, only discovered
last year.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.440
Miss Grayling kindly allowed me
access.

03:56.440 --> 04:00.240
What happened to Jack, Mr Parker?
It's rather tragic, actually.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.480
Lady Jane was to elope with Jack
and planned to live off the proceeds

04:03.480 --> 04:05.160
of her precious jewels.

04:05.160 --> 04:08.560
However, they both perished
on the cliff one fateful night.

04:08.560 --> 04:10.800
And what's happened to
Lady Jane's jewels?

04:10.800 --> 04:14.200
Well, legend has it she hid them in
the grounds of Malory Towers,

04:14.200 --> 04:16.880
she and Jack were to collect them
the night they eloped.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.720
But when their bodies were
discovered,

04:18.720 --> 04:20.120
there was no sign of the jewels.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.200
So they're still here,
hidden on the grounds?

04:22.200 --> 04:24.440
Don't get any ideas, Darrell.

04:24.440 --> 04:27.360
I understand numerous searches
have been made over the years.

04:27.360 --> 04:30.040
It always ends in failure.

04:30.040 --> 04:34.040
Erm, Sally and I have some prep
to finish.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.440
Can we be excused, Mr Parker?

04:41.480 --> 04:44.240
Er, I have work to catch up on too.

04:47.360 --> 04:51.240
Ellen, I'd like you to make some
copies of the script, please.

04:51.240 --> 04:53.800
Of course, Mr Parker.

04:53.800 --> 04:59.000
Oh, Irene, I'd like you to compose
some music to these lyrics

04:59.000 --> 05:00.560
I've written for the play.

05:03.480 --> 05:05.720
A love song, Mr Parker?

05:05.720 --> 05:07.800
Well, yes.

05:07.800 --> 05:11.720
These lyrics express how Jack feels
about Lady Jane.

05:11.720 --> 05:16.280
Anyway, I've written this note
to excuse you from French later,

05:16.280 --> 05:18.040
so you can work on the song.

05:23.640 --> 05:28.160
"My love, you're wild like the vast
crashing sea.

05:28.160 --> 05:32.160
"My love, you're strong,
like the stone towers over me."

05:32.160 --> 05:35.080
THEY LAUGH

05:32.160 --> 05:35.080
BOTH: How romantic!

05:40.920 --> 05:43.200
If only she could tell us
where the jewels were hidden.

05:43.200 --> 05:46.720
Do you really think they're worth
enough to save the school from
closing? Definitely.

05:46.720 --> 05:48.720
We're not the first to look, though.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.680
If they existed, surely they'd be
found by now.

05:51.680 --> 05:55.120
But Mr Parker said that the diary
was only discovered last year.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.400
So there must be lots of new clues.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.400
It's our new mission.
We are treasure seekers.

06:00.400 --> 06:01.720
Did someone say treasure?

06:03.680 --> 06:05.720
Oh...

06:05.720 --> 06:09.120
We... Let's do it, a proper
treasure hunt.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.360
Oh, mother would be chuffed
if we found it.

06:11.360 --> 06:13.080
She searched for years when she was
here.

06:13.080 --> 06:15.080
To be honest...

06:15.080 --> 06:17.160
..we're snowed under with prep and
auditions.

06:17.160 --> 06:19.560
I'm not. I could go read the diary
right away.

06:21.120 --> 06:23.160
Come on, Darrell, what happened
to you?

06:23.160 --> 06:27.240
We used to have such a jolly time.
I want to, but I can't.

06:27.240 --> 06:29.880
You can. You're not head of form.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.760
You'd have so much more fun with me.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.640
Can we really not tell her? I feel
awful.

06:40.640 --> 06:42.760
So do I, but we can't,

06:42.760 --> 06:44.960
because we have to tell her about
the school closing,

06:44.960 --> 06:47.640
and as much as I love Alicia,
she can't keep a secret.

06:47.640 --> 06:50.160
And it's not our secret to tell.
I know.

07:07.840 --> 07:09.960
Ah, bonjour, Irene. You're early.

07:09.960 --> 07:11.360
It's good to see you so eager.

07:11.360 --> 07:14.920
Sorry, Mademoiselle, Mr Parker
excused me from your lesson later.

07:14.920 --> 07:17.160
Oh, he asked me to give you this.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.760
Au revoir, Mademoiselle.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.920
"If our plans go 'a-ree'."

07:33.920 --> 07:37.920
For the 100th time Darrell,
it's 'awry', rhyming with sky.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.000
Meaning to go off course
or go wrong.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.440
Remember? Sorry, Gwen, it's just
we've been practising for ages now.

07:43.440 --> 07:44.760
All right.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.440
I could do with a break, too.
Let's resume after lunch.

07:49.880 --> 07:52.640
You have to read Lady Jane's diary.
Come here.

07:52.640 --> 07:56.320
It's amazing and chock full
of letters from Lady Jane to Jack.

07:56.320 --> 07:59.200
In fact, I swiped this.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.040
I can't make sense of it,
but perhaps you girls will.

08:04.320 --> 08:07.920
"To Jack, in the event of
my demise...

08:09.360 --> 08:15.120
"From where I sit up on my stool,
I cast my gaze upon the school.

08:15.120 --> 08:20.080
"The close it is not I that hides,
the gem you seek just look inside.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.280
"My ancient father's wooden frame,

08:22.280 --> 08:25.040
"the path towards your prize
to claim."

08:25.040 --> 08:26.920
Is this one of Lady Jane's poems?

08:26.920 --> 08:29.880
Whatever it is, it's definitely
a clue. Thank you so much, Alicia.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.040
Keep it safe, though.

08:31.040 --> 08:34.640
We'll have to return it to the diary
before Miss Grayling finds out it's
gone.

08:35.920 --> 08:37.480
Alicia's being so helpful.

08:37.480 --> 08:39.920
If we find the treasure, we can
confess to her later.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.600
Oh, no, no, no.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.760
This is Mr Parker's note
to mademoiselle.

08:59.760 --> 09:02.960
So? So I gave her his song lyrics
instead.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.880
Is that a problem? It's just a song.

09:04.880 --> 09:08.880
"My love, you are wild,
like the vast crashing sea.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.640
"My love..."

09:10.640 --> 09:14.200
Jean, it rather reads like
a declaration of love.

09:14.200 --> 09:16.040
She probably hasn't even read it
yet.

09:16.040 --> 09:18.800
And if she does, I'm sure she won't
take it like that.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.080
Make a start on the music and
collect the song lyrics

09:21.080 --> 09:23.640
from Mademoiselle at the end of
the class.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.360
It'll be fine.

09:48.480 --> 09:52.360
Erm, Mademoiselle, the note I gave
you from Mr Parker...

09:52.360 --> 09:54.880
Oh, wait, I have my reply waiting.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.880
Perhaps you could give him this?

09:59.000 --> 10:03.320
Erm, the thing is,
I think it might be...

10:03.320 --> 10:05.320
Might be what?

10:05.320 --> 10:07.600
It might be a beautiful day out
there.

10:07.600 --> 10:10.360
I'll deliver this and go
straight out and enjoy it.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.320
We're not getting anywhere, are we?

10:19.360 --> 10:21.600
"Look close, it is not I that hides

10:21.600 --> 10:25.920
"the gems you seek, just look inside
my ancient father's wooden frame."

10:25.920 --> 10:27.920
An ancient father might be what?

10:27.920 --> 10:29.240
A grandfather.

10:32.640 --> 10:34.520
How about a grandfather clock?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.320
THEY LAUGH

10:37.320 --> 10:39.280
"My ancient father's wooden frame,

10:39.280 --> 10:41.200
"the path towards your prize
to claim."

10:47.760 --> 10:49.200
No.

10:52.960 --> 10:54.360
Darrell...

11:02.040 --> 11:03.680
It's a map of the school grounds!

11:03.680 --> 11:06.960
Come on, let's go! Wait, wait, don't
you have an audition?

11:06.960 --> 11:09.000
Oh, curses. Never mind.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.360
I'll go as soon as it's over.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.320
We'll run through your lines.

11:30.880 --> 11:33.200
Jean, Mademoiselle already read
the note.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.800
She gave me this to give to
Mr Parker personally.

11:35.800 --> 11:38.640
Oh, dear. What if she's written
a love note back.

11:38.640 --> 11:41.720
Maybe I should read it just to make
certain.

11:41.720 --> 11:44.240
You can't do that, it's private.
I know, but...

11:45.960 --> 11:47.200
Just the first sentence.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.120
We'll know right away if it's a love
note or not.

11:50.880 --> 11:54.520
"At last, we can finally express
our true feelings for one another."

11:54.520 --> 11:56.520
I think we've read enough.

11:56.520 --> 11:57.920
He's going to be here any minute.

11:57.920 --> 12:01.320
What do I do, Jean?
Do I give him this or...?

12:01.320 --> 12:03.880
So, let's hear what you've done
then, Irene.

12:10.960 --> 12:15.240
IRENE PLAYS A TUNE

12:20.680 --> 12:25.120
Irene, I'm fairly certain
this is Greensleeves.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.360
Erm, no, it isn't.

12:27.360 --> 12:31.320
HE HUMS GREENSLEEVES TUNE

12:35.880 --> 12:39.480
Ah, right. So it is. Sorry.

12:39.480 --> 12:42.640
Irene, can you explain why you
haven't managed to come up

12:42.640 --> 12:44.720
with anything when you've had
the whole morning?

12:44.720 --> 12:46.040
I'm so sorry, Mr Parker.

12:46.040 --> 12:48.360
I couldn't think straight earlier
because I made a...

12:48.360 --> 12:51.240
SHE SIGHS

12:48.360 --> 12:51.240
How do I put this?

12:51.240 --> 12:52.560
Spit it out?

12:56.240 --> 12:59.680
Never mind. Mademoiselle gave me
this to give to you.

13:09.040 --> 13:10.560
Heavens to Betsy.

13:14.640 --> 13:17.520
GIRLS GIGGLE

13:22.760 --> 13:25.600
APPLAUSE

13:25.600 --> 13:27.360
Thank you.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.320
Well done.

13:33.320 --> 13:37.080
Up next is our last pair,
Gwen and Darrell.

13:37.080 --> 13:38.440
Break a leg, Gwen.

13:39.480 --> 13:40.840
Where is she?

13:48.040 --> 13:49.520
Where is Darrell?

13:50.600 --> 13:52.400
I saw them going off with
the script.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.320
I...

13:54.320 --> 13:56.720
Wait, I'm here. Sorry. Sorry.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.680
Sorry, Gwen, I lost track of time.

14:05.520 --> 14:07.480
All you have to do is say your line.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.920
Then I'll do my part.

14:10.400 --> 14:13.200
Jack, must it be tonight?

14:13.200 --> 14:15.440
We cannot delay a moment too long.

14:15.440 --> 14:17.840
But if the worst should happen,
if our plans go wrong...

14:17.840 --> 14:19.240
GEORGINA SIGHS

14:19.240 --> 14:21.280
..that's not my cue, remember.

14:23.160 --> 14:24.600
Now I've lost my place.

14:25.640 --> 14:28.360
WHISPERS: "We are to fail and
tonight is our last on this Earth."

14:31.600 --> 14:33.880
Even if we are to fail,

14:33.880 --> 14:37.240
and tonight is our last
on this Earth,

14:37.240 --> 14:41.560
I shall go to my grave knowing
what it meant to be loved.

14:47.160 --> 14:49.760
Gwen, very good,
except where you lost track.

14:49.760 --> 14:53.320
It wasn't me... Darrell, please
don't prompt unless directed to do
so.

14:53.320 --> 14:55.880
But could you read that last line
again for me, please?

14:55.880 --> 14:57.880
But they're Lady Jane's lines.

14:57.880 --> 15:00.080
I know. I'd like you to read
Lady Jane.

15:12.080 --> 15:14.160
Even if we are to fail,

15:14.160 --> 15:16.520
and tonight is our last
on this Earth,

15:16.520 --> 15:20.120
I shall go to my grave knowing
what it meant to be loved.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.560
CHEERING

15:20.120 --> 15:22.560
Well done, Darrell!

15:28.800 --> 15:31.720
Thank you, Darrell. And thank you,
everyone, for your efforts.

15:31.720 --> 15:33.880
I'll be announcing the roles
later today.

15:39.960 --> 15:42.320
You're sure this is where they went?
Definitely.

15:42.320 --> 15:44.840
They're probably in there
talking about the notes now.

15:44.840 --> 15:47.800
CHATTER AND LAUGHTER BEHIND DOOR

15:48.800 --> 15:50.040
What can you see?

15:50.040 --> 15:53.000
Er, Mr Parker's at Mademoiselle's
desk.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.960
She looks a little... What?

15:54.960 --> 15:56.560
A little what?

15:56.560 --> 16:00.320
Well, I don't know. She's laughing
and he looks embarrassed.

16:00.320 --> 16:03.040
She just nudged him.
What does that mean?

16:03.040 --> 16:04.960
Oh, no!

16:04.960 --> 16:06.520
MADEMOISELLE SPEAKS FRENCH

16:13.480 --> 16:15.280
SHE SIGHS
There's nothing here, Darrell.

16:15.280 --> 16:17.480
We should be getting back. Just a
couple more minutes.

16:17.480 --> 16:19.840
But we'll be in awful trouble.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.800
LOUD CLANK

16:21.800 --> 16:24.080
Oh, my goodness. This could be it!

16:28.880 --> 16:31.320
Oh, it is! It's the treasure!

16:32.440 --> 16:34.360
Well, open it, then.

16:38.600 --> 16:42.560
Maybe it's one of Lady Jane's poems
or another riddle.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.320
"The rose is red,
the violet is blue

16:44.320 --> 16:47.240
"There is no treasure
and the joke is on you."

16:47.240 --> 16:48.560
Got ya!

16:48.560 --> 16:53.440
This has to go down in Malory Towers
history as the best prank ever.

16:53.440 --> 16:56.280
A prank? But what about the riddle?

16:56.280 --> 17:00.960
"From where I sit up on my stool,
I cast my gaze upon the school."

17:02.560 --> 17:04.600
There was no school back then.

17:04.600 --> 17:06.400
But the treasure map?

17:06.400 --> 17:07.800
My handiwork.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.880
And that chest you're holding
is from the drama cupboard!

17:10.880 --> 17:12.600
SHE LAUGHS

17:13.720 --> 17:17.560
What's the matter with you two?
Why are you being such bad sports?

17:17.560 --> 17:19.960
I'm sorry. I suppose it is rather
funny.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.840
THEY LAUGH

17:21.840 --> 17:24.920
Doing a spot of gardening, girls?

17:24.920 --> 17:27.840
Er, not exactly. We were just...

17:27.840 --> 17:29.160
May I?

17:34.800 --> 17:37.680
Oh, very good.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.240
Who made this?

17:42.760 --> 17:45.880
Alicia, you may now add
cartography

17:45.880 --> 17:48.280
to your extracurricular
achievements.

17:52.120 --> 17:55.320
You know, when I lived here on
the grounds as a girl,

17:55.320 --> 18:00.120
I too spent many days looking for
Lady Jane's jewels.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.840
I was most tenacious.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.760
I'm sorry to disappoint,
but there is no treasure

18:07.760 --> 18:10.160
and you certainly won't find
anything in that diary.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.480
Trust me, I've studied it
thoroughly.

18:13.480 --> 18:19.160
Now, please fill in these holes
before you come in for tea.

18:19.160 --> 18:21.800
I can do this. Catch you up later.

18:32.880 --> 18:35.680
You two girls are in terrible
trouble.

18:35.680 --> 18:36.960
Terrible.

18:36.960 --> 18:40.000
I'm so sorry, Mademoiselle,
it was all the most awful mistake.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.600
The thing is, Irene misplaced
the note and gave Mademoiselle

18:42.600 --> 18:43.680
the song lyrics instead.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.520
We were worried that you thought
he meant it.

18:45.520 --> 18:48.280
Why would you imagine that
I thought he meant it?

18:48.280 --> 18:50.480
Er, well...

18:50.480 --> 18:54.200
The confusion with the song lyrics
is not the reason you're in trouble.

18:54.200 --> 18:57.200
You read my private letter
to Mr Parker, did you not?

18:57.200 --> 18:58.720
Yes. No.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.400
I did. It wasn't Jean.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.200
Well, at least we know you only read
the opening sentence.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.560
What do you mean?

19:05.840 --> 19:07.520
HE CLEARS THROAT

19:07.520 --> 19:11.160
"At last, we can finally express
our true feelings for one another.

19:12.200 --> 19:16.720
"Pardon Moi, Monsieur Parker. I'm
having some fun with these girls.

19:16.720 --> 19:20.320
"Let us see if they read my letter."

19:20.320 --> 19:21.600
It was a trick?

19:21.600 --> 19:23.720
I can't believe you teachers pranked
us.

19:23.720 --> 19:27.880
You should never, ever read
a person's private correspondence.

19:27.880 --> 19:30.000
I'm so sorry, Mr Parker.
No, Mr Parker.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.720
You're dismissed.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.680
Well, I think they learnt
a very serious lesson today.

19:39.680 --> 19:41.080
MADEMOISELLE LAUGHS

19:41.080 --> 19:43.880
Their little faces when they walked
in here.

19:46.280 --> 19:49.440
And now I understand why the girls
they play these tricks,

19:49.440 --> 19:51.760
it's the feeling it is...

19:51.760 --> 19:55.000
It is...extraordinaire!

20:04.400 --> 20:05.560
Gwen.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.440
Gwen.

20:10.560 --> 20:12.760
If you've come to gloat,
Darrell Rivers...

20:12.760 --> 20:14.680
About what? Why would I?

20:19.080 --> 20:22.880
"The Summits Of Love cast
Lady Jane Malory to...

20:22.880 --> 20:25.040
"..be played by Darrell Rivers."

20:27.440 --> 20:29.480
But I was only auditioning
to help you out.

20:29.480 --> 20:32.480
I didn't mean to get any part,
let alone Lady Jane.

20:32.480 --> 20:33.640
What part did you get?

20:33.640 --> 20:35.560
I'm not in it.

20:35.560 --> 20:38.480
She didn't cast me at all.
It's just a play, Gwen.

20:38.480 --> 20:40.760
It might just be a play to you,

20:40.760 --> 20:42.640
but I needed Mother to see me
as Lady Jane.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.360
If you knew what it was like for me
at home right now...

20:48.040 --> 20:51.040
Mother's really tense because of
Daddy

20:51.040 --> 20:53.960
and they're both taking it out
on me.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.680
What's up with your father?

20:57.200 --> 21:00.320
I know when my mother was very ill,
it affected Daddy.

21:00.320 --> 21:02.400
He even got short tempered with me.

21:02.400 --> 21:03.960
Is your father not very well?

21:05.240 --> 21:06.880
What? What do you mean?

21:06.880 --> 21:09.600
You said your mother was tense
because of your father.

21:10.640 --> 21:13.160
Yes. Yes, she is.

21:13.160 --> 21:16.840
You can confide in me, Gwen.
It's good to share. It helps.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.680
Well, it's what you just said.

21:18.680 --> 21:20.480
Dad isn't very well at all.

21:20.480 --> 21:21.760
Oh, you poor thing.

21:21.760 --> 21:23.560
This must be awful for you.

21:24.880 --> 21:26.880
Maybe there's a way I can help.

21:39.720 --> 21:42.640
Well, if it isn't the star
of my show.

21:43.720 --> 21:46.400
Yes, erm, about that.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.480
I'm afraid I can't accept the role.

21:48.480 --> 21:52.440
Oh, that's terribly disappointing.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.160
Can I ask why?

21:54.160 --> 21:57.320
It clashes with my other
school commitments.

21:57.320 --> 21:59.960
It is disappointing
and I'm really torn,

21:59.960 --> 22:02.480
but I do know someone perfect for
the role.

22:02.480 --> 22:04.200
Gwen. Gwen?

22:04.200 --> 22:07.760
Gwen couldn't remember her line for
one scene, let alone the whole play.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.360
Well, I know she stumbled in her
audition, but that was my fault.

22:10.360 --> 22:11.600
I fed her the wrong line.

22:11.600 --> 22:15.400
She's good, really she is,
and she does so look the part.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.080
Would you reconsider?

22:17.080 --> 22:20.840
Well, she does have some
stage presence.

22:35.760 --> 22:37.200
Sally.

22:45.160 --> 22:47.640
I'm sorry, you didn't find
the prank terribly funny.

22:47.640 --> 22:49.520
I just wanted to cheer you both up.

22:49.520 --> 22:52.240
You're so stuffy and serious
these days.

22:52.240 --> 22:54.560
It feels like the pair of you are
keeping things from me.

22:54.560 --> 22:56.200
We're not.

22:58.200 --> 23:00.240
Don't worry, Alicia, it's all fine.

23:00.240 --> 23:01.600
It doesn't feel fine.

23:01.600 --> 23:03.960
Why can't you just be honest
with me?

23:03.960 --> 23:06.040
You two never include me any more.

23:16.320 --> 23:18.640
Ah, you're both here.

23:18.640 --> 23:19.960
Obviously, as you know,

23:19.960 --> 23:22.160
Darrell isn't able to be involved in
the play, Gwen.

23:22.160 --> 23:24.920
Due to other school commitments,
I didn't have a choice.

23:24.920 --> 23:28.640
So I had to decide, at short notice,
on another actress for the part.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.880
Lady Jane will now be played by...

23:32.720 --> 23:34.360
..me.

23:34.360 --> 23:37.360
But how can you play the lead role
and direct?

23:37.360 --> 23:39.080
Oh, it's very fashionable.

23:39.080 --> 23:41.720
Look at Larry Olivier in Henry V.

23:41.720 --> 23:44.400
But Darrell isn't the only girl
to have a change of heart,

23:44.400 --> 23:47.040
so there is another part
going begging.

23:47.040 --> 23:50.240
Gwen, I've been thinking,
you'd make a rather splendid Jack.

23:50.240 --> 23:51.360
Are you interested?

23:51.360 --> 23:53.560
Jack? But...but he's a man.

23:53.560 --> 23:57.040
Mother would have palpitations
at my wearing trousers.

23:57.040 --> 24:00.440
Well, you can tell Mother
it's also a plum role.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.440
You'll shine in that part.

24:02.440 --> 24:04.040
So are you in?

24:04.040 --> 24:05.160
Of course.

24:05.160 --> 24:08.480
So here's your script and at the
bottom is your rehearsal schedule.

24:11.240 --> 24:14.080
Rehearsals every day for the next
two weeks. Hm-mm.

24:14.080 --> 24:15.560
See you at rehearsal.

24:20.120 --> 24:23.520
I had no idea Georgina would do
that. I'm so sorry.

24:23.520 --> 24:26.320
But I'm sure it would still make
your father happy

24:26.320 --> 24:28.480
seeing you up on stage when he's not
feeling well.

24:28.480 --> 24:32.040
Just don't say a word to anyone
about my father's illness.

24:32.040 --> 24:33.480
It's a very sensitive matter.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.240
Of course, Gwen,
I won't tell a soul.
