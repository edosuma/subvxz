WEBVTT

00:44.120 --> 00:46.359
THREE COLORS
BLUE

02:02.800 --> 02:03.999
Hurry, Anna.

02:07.520 --> 02:08.758
Get back in.

03:59.080 --> 04:01.399
Are you able to talk?

04:06.200 --> 04:09.519
During the...
were you conscious?

04:12.920 --> 04:15.399
I'm sorry to have to inform you...

04:16.600 --> 04:17.678
Do you know?

04:20.760 --> 04:22.119
Your husband...

04:22.960 --> 04:25.039
died in the accident.

04:31.760 --> 04:34.319
You must have been unconscious.

04:37.520 --> 04:38.959
Anna?

04:41.680 --> 04:44.079
Yes, your daughter too.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.879
Is someone there?
Who did that?

05:27.320 --> 05:28.119
Mr. Leroy,

05:28.560 --> 05:30.359
call the head of the ward.

05:30.520 --> 05:34.039
Someone broke a window
in the corridor on the first floor.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.359
Come right away.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.559
I'll look in the garden.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.599
I can't... I'm unable to...

06:43.760 --> 06:45.719
I broke the window.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.119
Don't worry.

06:48.560 --> 06:49.759
I'm sorry.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.119
We'll replace it.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.079
I'm sorry.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.679
Don't worry.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.559
Is it today?

07:57.000 --> 07:59.439
This afternoon. At five o'clock.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.079
Can I do anything for you?

09:21.560 --> 09:26.399
We are gathered here
to pay our last respects

09:26.560 --> 09:28.279
to a man,

09:29.280 --> 09:32.079
a composer that the entire world

09:32.840 --> 09:35.399
considered one of the greatest.

09:37.440 --> 09:38.439
No one

09:40.240 --> 09:43.799
can accept that he is gone.

09:45.280 --> 09:49.679
We also mourn
his five year-old daughter

09:50.800 --> 09:52.759
who died by his side.

09:56.280 --> 09:57.519
Patrice,

09:58.200 --> 10:00.479
millions of men

10:01.440 --> 10:02.639
and women

10:02.800 --> 10:05.839
awaited the music you composed

10:06.640 --> 10:08.799
for the Unification of Europe,

10:10.480 --> 10:13.559
which we all hope to celebrate soon.

11:06.920 --> 11:21.079
Hello.

11:25.240 --> 11:27.399
I know you don't want to see me.

11:27.560 --> 11:28.559
You're right.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.239
- Can I come in?
- No.

11:36.560 --> 11:39.359
Julie...
it's not for an interview.

11:40.080 --> 11:41.279
What then?

11:42.040 --> 11:45.799
I'm writing an article
about your husband.

11:46.520 --> 11:49.119
- I need to know something.
- About what?

11:49.280 --> 11:52.039
The concert
for the Unification of Europe.

11:55.160 --> 11:56.479
It doesn't exist.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.879
You've changed.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.439
You weren't so rude before.

12:01.600 --> 12:02.839
Haven't you heard?

12:03.880 --> 12:07.159
I had an accident.
I lost my daughter and my husband.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.719
Is it true you wrote
your husband's music?

12:56.680 --> 12:57.759
Hello!

12:59.560 --> 13:00.479
Bernard?

13:02.800 --> 13:03.999
Hello, ma'am.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.119
Did you do what I asked?

13:06.280 --> 13:09.159
- You cleared out the blue room?
- Everything.

13:10.080 --> 13:13.199
Madam, we're all deeply sorry.

14:30.960 --> 14:31.919
Marie.

14:43.320 --> 14:44.839
Why are you crying?

14:48.400 --> 14:50.199
Because you're not.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.439
I keep thinking of them.

14:59.240 --> 15:01.359
I remember everything.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.159
How can I forget?

16:04.000 --> 16:06.119
Would you like something to drink?

16:06.840 --> 16:07.679
No thank you.

16:12.120 --> 16:14.559
Let's sit down.
This could take a while.

16:18.320 --> 16:19.679
I'll be right back.

17:04.640 --> 17:05.959
No one must know.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.319
Ever.

17:09.160 --> 17:13.759
You'll pay for my mother's
rest home for the rest of her life.

17:14.920 --> 17:16.959
You'll take care of Marie...

17:18.040 --> 17:19.519
and the gardener.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.959
You'll sell all our possessions.

17:23.319 --> 17:25.839
The money will go
to the same account.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.759
The 270641196?

17:29.920 --> 17:30.719
Yes.

17:32.520 --> 17:35.199
May I ask you why?

17:36.440 --> 17:37.519
No.

17:39.640 --> 17:41.479
Would you excuse me?

17:51.040 --> 17:53.079
But what will you have left?

17:53.240 --> 17:54.439
My own account.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.399
I haven't started yet.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.359
I put it aside...

20:15.520 --> 20:16.879
The day I left?

20:17.240 --> 20:18.079
Yes.

20:21.520 --> 20:22.439
Here it is.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.639
I was waiting to hear from you.

20:25.840 --> 20:26.599
You were right.

20:37.720 --> 20:38.919
Lots of corrections.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.759
No more than usual.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.359
It's beautiful.

20:50.440 --> 20:51.959
I love this chorus.

20:55.960 --> 20:56.719
Yes.

23:02.040 --> 23:02.879
Hello?

23:03.040 --> 23:04.279
It’s Julie.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.319
Do you love me?

23:07.640 --> 23:08.359
Yes.

23:08.520 --> 23:09.799
Since when?

23:11.000 --> 23:13.199
Since I started working
with Patrice.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.119
Do you think of me?
Do you miss me?

23:16.880 --> 23:17.759
Yes.

23:18.640 --> 23:20.279
Come, if you want to.

23:21.080 --> 23:21.999
Now?

23:22.160 --> 23:23.919
Yes, now. Right away.

23:24.920 --> 23:26.039
Are you sure?

23:27.000 --> 23:27.839
Yes.

24:07.800 --> 24:08.879
Olivier?

24:21.600 --> 24:22.919
I fell.

24:23.080 --> 24:24.159
Take it off.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.319
The rest too.

25:45.120 --> 25:46.679
They took everything.

25:48.440 --> 25:50.319
Only the mattress is left.

26:25.240 --> 26:27.559
I appreciate what you did for me.

26:29.640 --> 26:32.079
But you see,
I'm like any other woman.

26:32.240 --> 26:34.319
I sweat. I cough.

26:34.880 --> 26:35.959
I have cavities.

26:38.480 --> 26:39.999
You won't miss me.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.319
You understand that now.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.719
Shut the door when you leave.

27:07.800 --> 27:08.719
Julie!

28:24.280 --> 28:26.719
I don't want any children
in the building.

28:27.120 --> 28:29.799
Let me ask you something.
It may help.

28:30.280 --> 28:31.399
What do you do?

28:31.560 --> 28:32.439
Nothing.

28:33.360 --> 28:34.919
I mean, for a living?

28:35.080 --> 28:36.039
Nothing.

28:36.640 --> 28:37.639
Nothing at all?

28:37.800 --> 28:39.079
Nothing at all.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.159
I have what you're looking for.

28:44.520 --> 28:46.639
You'll like it,
but it's being redone.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.479
It may take a while.

28:48.840 --> 28:50.399
But I can live there now?

28:50.560 --> 28:53.079
Sure. It needs a quick paint job,
the carpets changed...

28:55.480 --> 28:57.879
I'd like to see it now.
May I?

28:58.040 --> 29:00.279
Of course. What's your name?

29:01.160 --> 29:03.199
Julie de Courcy, with a "Y".

29:05.800 --> 29:07.719
Sorry, Julie Vignon.
I'm going back

29:07.880 --> 29:09.159
to my maiden name.

31:05.320 --> 31:06.279
Coffee and ice cream?

31:06.440 --> 31:07.679
As usual.

34:52.560 --> 35:01.439
Is anyone there?

38:04.240 --> 38:06.599
I'm sorry for the noise.
I've almost finished.

38:06.760 --> 38:08.239
I haven't heard anything.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.079
May I?

38:14.400 --> 38:16.879
I heard you got locked out
last week.

38:17.040 --> 38:18.919
Your husband lent me a blanket.

38:19.080 --> 38:21.159
I spent the night in the stairwell.

38:21.320 --> 38:23.279
I wanted you to sign this.

38:24.320 --> 38:25.519
What is it?

38:25.680 --> 38:26.879
Everyone has signed already.

38:28.800 --> 38:31.799
We don't want loose women
in our building.

38:31.960 --> 38:33.639
The young woman downstairs...

38:34.000 --> 38:36.079
I don't want to get involved.

38:36.640 --> 38:37.599
She's a whore!

38:41.040 --> 38:42.719
That's not my problem.

39:57.240 --> 40:01.519
You're in perfect health.
Everything is fine.

40:05.320 --> 40:06.679
You're in good spirits.

40:11.040 --> 40:12.599
Hello, it's Antoine.

40:13.640 --> 40:14.679
It’s for you.

40:18.960 --> 40:21.719
Hello. My name is Antoine.
You don't know me.

40:21.880 --> 40:22.999
No, I don't. Excuse me...

40:23.600 --> 40:24.519
Who is this?

40:26.120 --> 40:28.839
He's been looking for you.
I said he could call.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.239
That's okay.

40:31.320 --> 40:34.519
I'd like to meet you.
It’s important.

40:34.680 --> 40:36.159
Nothing's important.

40:37.240 --> 40:38.439
It’s about an object.

40:38.600 --> 40:39.679
What object?

40:40.160 --> 40:41.199
A necklace...

40:41.640 --> 40:43.279
with a cross.

41:07.360 --> 41:09.079
I'd forgotten about it.

41:10.400 --> 41:12.639
I found it near the car.

41:14.200 --> 41:15.199
But...

41:16.960 --> 41:20.199
I couldn't keep it.
That's stealing.

41:23.080 --> 41:26.399
If you want to ask me something,
I got there just after...

41:26.560 --> 41:27.239
No.

41:41.680 --> 41:42.999
I'm sorry.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.439
I wanted to return the necklace,

41:51.120 --> 41:53.519
but I wanted
to ask you something, too.

41:53.920 --> 41:54.639
Yes?

41:56.560 --> 41:58.479
When I opened the door,

42:00.280 --> 42:02.199
your husband was still alive.

42:03.840 --> 42:04.959
He said...

42:07.160 --> 42:08.799
...I don't understand...

42:09.680 --> 42:10.639
he said...

42:11.640 --> 42:13.919
"Now try coughing."

42:32.920 --> 42:35.879
My husband was telling us a joke.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.559
It’s about a woman who...

42:39.000 --> 42:41.559
who can't stop coughing.
She sees a doctor.

42:42.800 --> 42:46.639
He examines her and gives her
a pill. She swallows it.

42:48.480 --> 42:50.079
She asks what it is.

42:51.360 --> 42:54.479
The doctor says: "It's the most
powerful laxative there is."

42:55.280 --> 42:57.239
"A laxative for a cough?"

42:57.640 --> 43:00.919
"Yes," says the doctor.
"Now try coughing!"

43:03.720 --> 43:04.919
It made us laugh.

43:07.760 --> 43:09.879
Then the car crashed.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.639
My husband always liked

43:17.880 --> 43:19.119
to repeat the punch line.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.159
You returned it.

43:25.280 --> 43:26.439
It's yours.

44:42.760 --> 44:43.999
Are you sick?

44:51.200 --> 44:52.159
Are you okay?

45:02.560 --> 45:05.239
You always gotta hold
onto something.

45:05.480 --> 45:06.919
What did you say?

45:37.240 --> 45:38.119
Thanks.

45:38.800 --> 45:39.399
For what?

45:39.640 --> 45:40.559
I'm staying.

45:42.240 --> 45:46.039
They needed everyone's signature
to kick me out. So I'm staying.

45:50.560 --> 45:51.999
Your place is cool.

46:02.720 --> 46:05.359
When I was a kid,
I had a lamp just like this.

46:07.440 --> 46:09.799
I'd stand under it
and stretch out my hand.

46:11.680 --> 46:14.479
I dreamt of jumping up
and touching it.

46:22.080 --> 46:23.999
I forgot all about it.

46:28.480 --> 46:29.759
Where did you find it?

46:31.640 --> 46:32.759
I found it.

46:34.040 --> 46:35.239
Is it a souvenir?

46:38.240 --> 46:39.399
You live alone?

46:41.520 --> 46:42.279
Yes.

46:43.560 --> 46:45.559
I could never spend
a night alone.

46:50.120 --> 46:52.239
Something must have happened.

46:52.480 --> 46:55.119
You're not the type
somebody dumps.

47:11.200 --> 47:12.719
Sorry. I talk too much.

47:24.680 --> 47:25.799
Poor guy.

47:27.520 --> 47:28.479
Who?

47:29.040 --> 47:31.359
He was asleep there last night.

47:31.840 --> 47:33.679
He's gone now,
but he left his flute.

47:52.920 --> 47:54.199
A coffee.

48:02.800 --> 48:04.239
I searched everywhere.

48:05.840 --> 48:06.439
And?

48:06.680 --> 48:07.839
I found you.

48:10.480 --> 48:11.919
No one knows where I live.

48:12.160 --> 48:12.959
No one.

48:13.960 --> 48:16.919
It took a few months.
Then I got lucky.

48:17.160 --> 48:19.799
My cleaning lady's daughter
saw you in the area.

48:21.960 --> 48:23.479
I've come here ever since.

48:24.320 --> 48:25.319
You're spying on me?

48:25.560 --> 48:26.159
No.

48:27.480 --> 48:28.599
I miss you.

48:37.880 --> 48:39.399
You ran away?

48:43.640 --> 48:44.879
From me?

49:32.800 --> 49:34.519
Do you hear what he's playing?

49:41.360 --> 49:42.319
It sounds like...

49:42.720 --> 49:43.399
Yes.

49:50.160 --> 49:51.239
I've seen you.

49:52.560 --> 49:54.999
Maybe that will do for now.

49:57.520 --> 49:58.559
I'll try.

50:24.280 --> 50:26.239
How do you know this music?

50:26.800 --> 50:29.879
I invent lots of things.
I like to play.

52:01.960 --> 52:04.839
Just a second.
A problem with your place?

52:05.080 --> 52:07.879
No, I'd like another one
just like it.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.519
I can manage that.
But it'll take some time.

52:12.760 --> 52:13.399
How long?

52:14.200 --> 52:15.239
Two or three months.

52:18.800 --> 52:19.479
You cut yourself

52:19.640 --> 52:20.719
shaving.

52:24.520 --> 52:25.759
My cat scratched me.

53:44.040 --> 53:44.719
Mom?

53:47.960 --> 53:49.159
Marie-France.

53:53.800 --> 53:54.879
It's me.

53:56.600 --> 53:57.639
Julie.

54:00.640 --> 54:02.039
Come closer.

54:12.440 --> 54:14.319
They told me you were dead.

54:16.040 --> 54:16.839
You seem fine.

54:19.680 --> 54:21.239
Young. So young.

54:23.160 --> 54:26.599
You were always younger,
but now you look 30.

54:26.840 --> 54:28.879
- When we were kids...
- I'm not your sister.

54:29.120 --> 54:32.079
I'm your daughter.
I'm 33.

54:32.320 --> 54:33.679
I know, I know.

54:34.880 --> 54:36.039
I'm joking.

54:37.160 --> 54:37.799
I'm fine.

54:38.040 --> 54:40.439
I have everything here.
The TV...

54:43.000 --> 54:44.639
I can see the whole world.

54:47.200 --> 54:48.639
Do you watch too?

54:48.880 --> 54:49.679
No.

55:01.640 --> 55:04.839
You want to tell me
about your husband and your home?

55:05.880 --> 55:07.159
Or about your children?

55:09.960 --> 55:11.599
Or about yourself?

55:12.840 --> 55:13.759
Mom...

55:18.040 --> 55:20.079
my husband and daughter
are dead.

55:20.880 --> 55:22.399
I have no home any more.

55:24.240 --> 55:25.239
They told me.

55:34.640 --> 55:37.119
Before, I was happy.

55:37.920 --> 55:39.919
I loved them.
They loved me too.

55:45.120 --> 55:46.719
Mom, are you listening?

55:48.360 --> 55:49.399
Yes, Marie-France.

55:55.320 --> 55:58.039
Now I have only
one thing left to do:

55:59.840 --> 56:00.839
nothing.

56:03.840 --> 56:06.279
I don't want any belongings,
any memories.

56:06.800 --> 56:09.799
No friends, no love.
Those are all traps.

56:11.880 --> 56:14.559
Do you have any money, my child?
To get by?

56:15.120 --> 56:15.879
I have enough.

56:16.120 --> 56:19.239
That's important.
You can't give up everything.

56:24.800 --> 56:25.679
Mom.

56:26.480 --> 56:27.319
Yes?

56:29.200 --> 56:30.559
Was I scared of mice

56:30.800 --> 56:31.719
as a kid?

56:32.840 --> 56:34.399
You weren't scared.

56:36.240 --> 56:38.279
It was Julie who was scared.

56:39.240 --> 56:40.719
Now I'm scared.

58:25.280 --> 58:28.319
I'm glad to see you.
Come in.

58:28.560 --> 58:30.519
I have a favor to ask.

58:31.400 --> 58:33.719
My wife isn't here.
Come on in.

58:33.960 --> 58:35.999
Can you lend me your cat?

58:37.200 --> 58:38.359
Excuse me?

58:38.600 --> 58:42.279
Your cat.
I need it for a couple of days.

58:43.040 --> 58:45.759
He's not neutered.
He can get violent.

58:57.480 --> 58:58.599
I'm not sure he likes you.

59:40.520 --> 59:41.959
Why are you here?

59:42.200 --> 59:45.039
I saw you from the bus.
You were running like crazy.

59:46.720 --> 59:47.599
Are you crying?

59:58.920 --> 01:00:00.239
It's the water.

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.999
- You don't wear underwear?
- Never.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:14.559
I borrowed the neighbor's cat
to kill the mouse.

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.439
It had babies.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.639
It's only normal, Julie.
You're afraid to go back?

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.159
I'll go clean up.

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:39.159
I'll see you at my place.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.639
It’s Lucille.
I need a favor.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.959
Take a taxi here.
I'll pay you back.

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:12.599
Now?

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:14.439
It’s late.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.959
It’s 11:30. You have 25 minutes.
It’s important.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.079
I can't.

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:23.079
Please. I've never asked you
anything. I have to now. Come.

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:24.639
Where?

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:28.759
3 Cité du Midi. It’s near Pigalle.
First door on the left.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.519
There's a buzzer.
Say it's for me. You'll come?

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:49.799
Yes?

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.239
I'm here to see Lucille.

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:52.279
I'm coming.

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.079
You came.

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:40.399
I'm sorry.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:43.759
Sorry.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.559
Are you angry?

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:55.959
No.

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:02.279
Lucille, we're on in 5 minutes.
Get me ready.

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.279
After I changed,
I came here for a drink.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:12.719
I looked around the audience,
for no reason.

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:15.839
In the middle,

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.679
in the first row, I saw my father.

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:26.039
He seemed tired.

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:28.839
He was nodding off...

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:32.719
but kept staring
at the girl's ass.

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:37.319
The shithead who let you in
wouldn't make him leave.

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:42.119
If you pay, you can peep.
Get it?

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:46.359
I didn't know who I could count on.

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:50.359
I was desperate.
I didn't know who to talk to.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.399
- So I called you.
- And your father?

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:57.159
Ten minutes ago,

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:01.159
he looked at his watch and left.

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:07.679
I realized the last train
to Montpellier is at 11:45.

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:09.839
Lucille, why do you do this?

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.519
Because I like to.

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.199
I think everyone likes to.

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.999
Julie, you saved my life.

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.159
I didn't do a thing.

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.919
I asked you to come and you came.
Same thing.

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:28.799
No.

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:37.999
Isn't that you?

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.039
Lucille, we're on.

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:45.959
It's me.

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:52.399
...the European Council asked you

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:55.719
to finish the score
begun by Patrice de Courcy.

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:59.679
I agreed to.
I'm working on it now...

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:02.239
trying to understand
what he was aiming for.

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:04.639
It’s not easy... I don't know.

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:06.119
Can you tell us something

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:10.359
about this score, shown here
for the very first time?

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:13.919
It’s the first part

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.799
of a major concerto
Patrice composed,

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:18.879
commissioned
by the European Council.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.719
The concerto was
to be played just once

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:26.439
by twelve symphonic orchestras

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:29.559
in the twelve united
European cities.

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:34.199
Patrice was someone who...
was secretive.

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:37.919
The only one person
who understood him...

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:39.519
was Julie, his wife.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.479
I tried asking her to participate

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.799
in this program,
but unfortunately,

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.359
she refused.

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:51.759
I assume that these documents
are from the archives.

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:54.759
No, they're not archives.
Who can predict...?

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:57.039
They're photos and documents

01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:00.479
I found in Patrice's desk
at the Conservatory.

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.399
His wife didn't want them.

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:05.519
I'm not sure
I should show them.

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:07.439
He was a great man.

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:10.599
One of the most important
composers of our time.

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.319
I'll be five minutes.

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.039
Where did I put it?

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.399
A green calling card.

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.519
Did you watch TV today?

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.399
Not at all.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:11.759
Here it is.

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:14.719
Her number at home and at work.

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.799
Why do you want it?

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:23.519
Today, on TV,
she showed the scores

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.119
I took from you.

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:27.399
Yes...

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:33.959
After the accident, when
nothing was sure, I made a copy.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.839
When you picked it up,
I knew you'd destroy it.

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:41.399
I kept the copy.
I sent it to Strasbourg.

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:43.279
Why did you do that?

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:49.319
This music is so beautiful.
You can't destroy things like that.

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:11.439
Olivier!

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.679
I'm sorry.

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:34.759
It's nothing.

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:39.078
I heard you're finishing
Patrice's concerto.

01:08:39.319 --> 01:08:40.719
I thought I could try...

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:43.359
You can't.
You have no right.

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:45.038
It'll never be the same.

01:08:45.279 --> 01:08:45.919
Understand?

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:48.639
I said I'd try.
I don't know if I'll finish.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:52.959
I'll tell you why. It was a way...
that's what I thought...

01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:56.279
to make you cry, make you run.

01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:01.359
The only way of making you say,
"I want" or "I don't want".

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:04.999
It's not fair.

01:09:05.479 --> 01:09:07.479
You didn't leave me any choice.

01:09:13.479 --> 01:09:15.078
You don't have the right to.

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:17.559
You want to see what I've done?

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:21.599
I'm not sure I understood.

01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:24.799
If I could play for you...

01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:59.119
Do you know what the chorus sings?

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:01.679
I thought Patrice had told you.

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:02.559
No.

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:05.279
In Greek, the rhythm is different.

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:27.319
Who was that girl?

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.519
What girl?

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:36.159
In the photos on the program.
She was with Patrice.

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.399
Didn't you know?

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.079
Just tell me.

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:43.319
Were they together?

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:44.959
Yes.

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.319
Since when?

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:52.119
Several years.

01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:59.399
Where does she live?

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:01.279
Near Montparnasse.

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:05.119
They often met at the courts.
She's a lawyer.

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:08.239
Or she works for one.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:11.799
What do you want to do?

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:29.399
Meet her.

01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:01.639
Excuse me.

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:40.959
...what about equality?

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:48.199
Is it because I don't speak French

01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:50.959
that the court won't hear my case?

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:48.839
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:57.159
Yes?

01:13:58.480 --> 01:13:59.879
You were
my husband's mistress?

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:02.599
Yes.

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:08.559
I didn't know. I just found out.

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:13.359
It’s a shame.

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:17.039
Now you'll hate him.
You'll hate me too.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:18.119
I don't know...

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:22.239
Of course you will.

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:31.759
Is that his baby?

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:36.279
Yes.

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:39.959
But he didn't know.
I found out...

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:43.159
I found out after the accident.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.959
I didn't want a child, but
it happened. Now I want to keep it.

01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:00.719
Do you have a cigarette?

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:15.399
You shouldn't.

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:25.159
You want to know
when and where?

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.399
How many times a month?

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:28.599
No.

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.599
You want to know if he loved me?

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:35.919
Yes, that was my question.

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.079
But why ask?

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:40.639
I know he loved you.

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:44.279
Yes.

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:46.919
He loved me.

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:49.999
Julie...

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:53.679
Will you hate me now?

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.239
Come in.

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:36.039
Did something happen?

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:39.919
You met her?

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:57.319
Once you asked me
to take Patrice's papers.

01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:00.399
- You didn't want to.
- No, but if I had...

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.159
The photos were among them?

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:06.679
Yes.

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:10.359
If I had taken them,
I'd have known.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.639
If I'd burned them,

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.239
I'd never have known.

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:16.519
That's right.

01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:21.519
Maybe it's better this way.

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:25.159
Can you show me
what you've composed?

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:27.919
These are the violins?

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:29.159
The altos.

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:38.999
And now...

01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:53.839
Wait a second. Lighter,
without the percussions.

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:01.959
Let's remove the trumpets.

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:12.719
Piano, piano, sul, sul tasto.

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.079
Instead of a piano...

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:20.719
A flute?

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:23.559
A flute. Start back here.

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:51.399
That's as far as I got.

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:53.719
And the finale?

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:55.639
I don't know.

01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:59.159
There was a paper.

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:05.399
The counterpoint
was supposed to come back.

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.519
He told me: "It’s a memento."

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:17.599
Try weaving it back in.

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:20.839
Van den Budenmayer?

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:25.999
He wanted to allude to him at the
end. You know how much he loved him.

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:31.439
Are you still in touch
with our lawyer?

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:32.719
Sometimes.

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:35.039
Did he sell the house yet?

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:36.079
I don't know.

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:38.159
I doubt it. He'd have called.

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.359
Tell him not to.

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:41.439
Okay.

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:44.199
If you can handle all this,

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.199
will you show me?

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:47.839
I'll show you.

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:55.239
There was a mattress inside.

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:57.519
Mr. Olivier bought it.

01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:59.719
I didn't think you'd need it.

01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:00.759
That's fine.

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:13.959
Have you been here before?

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:16.719
No, never.

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:24.319
Upstairs are the bedrooms and
the office. I'll show you them later.

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:28.439
This is the kitchen.
It’s always been like this.

01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:35.319
Is it a boy

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:36.319
or a girl?

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:37.999
A boy.

01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.159
Have you chosen a name?

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:43.359
Yes.

01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:47.999
I thought...

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:51.479
he should have his name
and his house.

01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:52.719
Here.

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:55.719
Do you still need me?

01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:58.039
No, you can go home.
Thank you.

01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:03.799
I knew it.

01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:04.839
What?

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:07.719
Patrice told me a lot about you.

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:09.439
Really?

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:11.199
Like what?

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:13.279
That you are good.

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:16.639
That you are good and generous.

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:19.599
That's what you want to be.

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:23.159
People can always count on you.

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:25.399
Even me.

01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:33.759
I'm sorry.

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.239
It’s me. I've finished.

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:29.039
Come pick it up tomorrow.
Or now, if you're not too tired.

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:32.879
I'm not tired. But I won't come
pick up the score.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:34.679
What?

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:37.319
I won't pick it up.

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:42.879
I've been thinking about it all
week long. This music can be mine.

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:44.599
A little heavy and awkward,

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:49.319
but mine. Or yours,
but everyone would have to know.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.079
Are you there?

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:55.559
I'm here.

01:23:58.680 --> 01:23:59.839
You're right.

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:36.559
It's me again.
I wanted to ask you.

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.759
You really sleep
on the mattress...?

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:39.639
Yes.

01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:44.639
You never told me.

01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:47.119
No, I didn't.

01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:56.999
Do you still love me?

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:01.519
I love you.

01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:06.959
Are you alone?

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:08.959
Of course I'm alone.

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:18.759
I'm coming.

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:52.439
Though I speak
with the tongue of angels,

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:57.439
If I have not love,

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:03.639
I am become as hollow brass.

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:49.639
Though I have the gift of prophecy,

01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:52.119
And understand all mysteries

01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:56.679
And all knowledge...

01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:01.399
And though I have enough faith

01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:05.999
To move the mightiest mountains,

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:10.119
If I have not love,

01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:17.319
I am nothing.

01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:21.599
Love is patient.

01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:26.199
Love is kind.

01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:29.959
It bears all things.

01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:32.959
It hopes all things.

01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:59.519
Love never fails.

01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:03.719
For prophecies shall fail,

01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:07.639
Tongues shall cease,

01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:11.519
Knowledge shall wither away.

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:39.159
For prophecies shall fail,

01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:43.159
Tongues shall cease,

01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:48.119
Knowledge shall wither away.

01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:11.159
And now shall abide...

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.519
Faith, hope, and love.

01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:42.839
But the greatest of these three

01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:45.799
Is love.
