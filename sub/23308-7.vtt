00:00.001 --> 00:01.533
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

00:01.543 --> 00:03.511
Poppy Kline. Dragonologist.

00:03.546 --> 00:05.346
Post-graduate fellow
and field researcher.

00:05.358 --> 00:07.363
- At your service.
- You're from Brakebills?

00:07.374 --> 00:08.998
<i>I'll go to Fillory on one condition.</i>

00:09.008 --> 00:11.134
That girl you saw in the
dungeon... we'll get her out.

00:11.587 --> 00:12.812
Victoria.

00:12.823 --> 00:13.890
You found me.

00:13.901 --> 00:14.954
Look, I'm here.

00:14.965 --> 00:16.936
No, I have to put myself back together.

00:16.947 --> 00:18.033
I need to sign out.

00:18.044 --> 00:20.587
You are a danger to yourself
and to others.

00:20.597 --> 00:21.921
No.

00:21.931 --> 00:23.623
The fairies aren't just terraforming,

00:23.633 --> 00:25.285
they're growing an army.

00:25.296 --> 00:26.850
We need a plan bigger than

00:26.861 --> 00:28.357
just assassinating the Queen. We need...

00:28.368 --> 00:30.196
Hostages, leverage. Don't ask questions.

00:30.206 --> 00:32.299
- Did you get the key?
- I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

00:32.308 --> 00:34.533
- I'm a terrible failure.
- Benedict, no!

00:36.846 --> 00:39.538
They don't just make portals.
They are portals.

00:39.548 --> 00:41.307
The key way to the Underworld.

00:41.317 --> 00:44.443
It's magic.
I'd do anything to get it back.

00:44.453 --> 00:46.612
If I could give it to you, I would.

00:46.622 --> 00:48.614
<i>I see the transfer worked.</i>

00:48.624 --> 00:50.783
Alice, are you okay? Alice.

00:50.793 --> 00:52.284
Ah... Alice!

00:52.294 --> 00:55.387
Okay, someone's gotta hear this, please.

01:01.737 --> 01:03.453
I'm sorry. Husband problems.

01:03.464 --> 01:06.336
The little weirdo wouldn't go to sleep
until I read him a bedtime story.

01:06.347 --> 01:08.800
That's disturbing. Let's hustle.

01:08.810 --> 01:10.702
Q's probably already at the tree.

01:10.712 --> 01:12.170
Tick, how are we doing?

01:12.180 --> 01:14.639
Five minutes till
the fairy guards change shifts,

01:14.649 --> 01:15.974
Your Majesties.

01:15.984 --> 01:19.211
Now, no one knows we're gone, okay?

01:19.221 --> 01:22.814
If the Fairy Queen asks, we're
bedridden with something contagious.

01:22.824 --> 01:24.148
Like chicken pox.

01:24.158 --> 01:25.817
Certainly, Highness. But must you leave?

01:25.827 --> 01:28.543
Prince Fomar's people have
been somewhat... difficult.

01:28.554 --> 01:30.588
- What do you mean?
- It seems your union

01:30.598 --> 01:32.490
gave the Floaters
the distinct impression

01:32.500 --> 01:33.825
that this land is now theirs.

01:33.835 --> 01:36.861
They've been, well, pillaging... a lot.

01:36.871 --> 01:38.996
I-I thought perhaps a royal address...

01:39.006 --> 01:40.497
You're thinking too small.

01:40.507 --> 01:43.067
There's only one way
out of all of this, Tick.

01:43.077 --> 01:45.002
- Extortion.
- Exactly!

01:45.012 --> 01:47.671
I need you to stay strong.
We are working on it.

01:47.681 --> 01:49.673
But we can't deal with the Floaters

01:49.683 --> 01:53.618
until we deal with the Fairies, got it?

01:53.954 --> 01:56.112
I can't believe you paid
the Hudson River dragon

01:56.122 --> 01:57.681
to send you to the Underworld.

01:57.691 --> 01:58.849
That is so cool.

01:58.859 --> 02:00.450
Yeah, well, it was a one-off.

02:00.460 --> 02:03.286
Can't exactly go back to her
without something to trade.

02:03.296 --> 02:05.422
Ah, I hear she's kinda withholding.

02:05.432 --> 02:06.777
And judge-y.

02:06.788 --> 02:09.327
Anyway, you think your ghost
friend's gonna be able to help us?

02:09.338 --> 02:12.175
There's no "us." I'm gonna
go talk to Penny alone,

02:12.186 --> 02:13.737
and you're gonna go back
to whatever life

02:13.748 --> 02:15.512
you were willing to backstab me for.

02:15.522 --> 02:18.916
Okay, I'm kinda sensing
some hostility here, and...

02:18.926 --> 02:20.250
Q!

02:20.260 --> 02:21.951
Oh, good.

02:21.962 --> 02:25.288
Hey, I don't know if it was just,
like, a super anxious rabbit,

02:25.298 --> 02:27.506
but your message made
things seem kinda...

02:27.517 --> 02:28.525
Dire? They are.

02:28.535 --> 02:30.193
- Are those supplies?
- Hostages.

02:30.203 --> 02:32.629
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm Poppy.

02:32.639 --> 02:34.197
I'm helping Quentin find the next key.

02:34.207 --> 02:37.200
- No, she's not helping me. We're...
- Okay, can we hit pause on the recap

02:37.210 --> 02:39.035
until we're back
where our pasty usurpers

02:39.045 --> 02:41.037
won't kill us all?

02:41.047 --> 02:42.739
<i>♪ I've got all my life to live ♪</i>

02:42.749 --> 02:44.907
<i>♪ I've got all my love to give ♪</i>

02:44.917 --> 02:48.711
<i>♪ And I'll survive I will survive ♪</i>

02:48.721 --> 02:50.713
<i>♪ Hey hey ♪</i>

02:54.560 --> 02:55.885
Oh, my God.

02:55.895 --> 02:59.155
Alice? Hey, hey, hey, hey.

02:59.165 --> 03:02.224
Alice, can you hear me?

03:07.609 --> 03:11.562
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:13.245 --> 03:14.903
I told you, I'm fine.

03:14.913 --> 03:17.136
I'm not sure what definition
of "fine" you're using.

03:17.147 --> 03:18.406
I expected this, okay?

03:18.416 --> 03:21.676
My body's just getting
used to Julia's magic.

03:21.686 --> 03:23.779
There are occasional surges.

03:23.789 --> 03:25.147
That's all this was.

03:25.157 --> 03:27.448
I mean, was that all this was? A surge?

03:27.458 --> 03:30.752
Or more likely her body is
going through the equivalent

03:30.762 --> 03:32.754
of organ transplant protection.

03:32.764 --> 03:35.089
Attacking itself to get
rid of the invader.

03:36.154 --> 03:38.092
Or maybe it's nothing at all. Who knows?

03:38.102 --> 03:39.294
Who knows?

03:39.305 --> 03:40.995
Well, we need a better answer than that.

03:41.005 --> 03:44.165
You wanted to do the spell.
It's all an experiment.

03:44.175 --> 03:46.934
I have no idea what's going to happen.

03:46.944 --> 03:48.503
Look, I prepared for this, okay?

03:48.513 --> 03:50.938
Energy-balancing spells, exercises...

03:50.948 --> 03:52.639
I suppose that could work.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.608
Your confidence is overwhelming.

03:54.618 --> 03:56.310
What's the point of lying?

03:56.320 --> 04:01.156
You people are just going to do
what you do, regardless...

04:02.326 --> 04:03.992
Q.

04:09.566 --> 04:11.124
Okay, you go get the key, I got this.

04:11.134 --> 04:12.793
No, I'm gonna stay here and help.

04:12.803 --> 04:17.163
I don't think more is merrier here.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.632
I don't know... didn't you notice
your ex is a little...

04:19.642 --> 04:22.135
Stubborn.

04:22.145 --> 04:24.070
I noticed.

04:24.080 --> 04:26.639
Alice and I got into this together.

04:26.649 --> 04:28.541
I'll get us out, one way or another.

04:28.551 --> 04:31.874
And I will make sure that she's okay.

04:31.885 --> 04:32.912
Okay?

04:32.922 --> 04:35.381
Go get the key while you still can.

04:35.391 --> 04:38.159
We're all kinda counting on you
to bring back all of magic.

04:40.996 --> 04:43.356
So you lost your key in the Underworld

04:43.366 --> 04:46.325
and now want me to somehow
go down there and get it.

04:46.335 --> 04:48.994
Well, you're my only friend
who's technically dead, so...

04:49.004 --> 04:52.498
For the millionth time,
dumbass, I'm not dead.

04:52.508 --> 04:53.932
I'm an astral projection.

04:53.942 --> 04:57.502
No offense, but your corpse is ash,

04:57.512 --> 05:01.006
so I think maybe you might be
in a little bit of denial.

05:01.016 --> 05:03.909
I mean, look, weren't you
supposed to report

05:03.919 --> 05:06.178
to the Underworld branch
of the Library anyway?

05:06.188 --> 05:07.263
Yeah.

05:07.274 --> 05:08.914
And I burned my body to avoid that.

05:08.924 --> 05:11.049
Look, if we do not get to the Underworld

05:11.059 --> 05:14.185
before Benedict moves on...
whatever that means...

05:14.195 --> 05:16.788
then we will have no
idea where the key goes.

05:16.798 --> 05:17.955
That's not my problem.

05:17.965 --> 05:20.024
No magic is everyone's problem.

05:20.034 --> 05:23.595
Do you think that
I like begging for help?

05:23.605 --> 05:25.089
Especially to you?

05:25.100 --> 05:27.140
I wouldn't even do it,
except that I know that you

05:27.151 --> 05:29.534
occasionally stop being a dick
when the fate of the world

05:29.544 --> 05:31.869
is at stake.

05:31.879 --> 05:34.713
Fine. I'll help.

05:35.383 --> 05:37.875
But it's not like I can
just Travel to the Underworld.

05:37.885 --> 05:39.543
So we need a gatekeeper.

05:39.553 --> 05:42.113
A dragon, like Jules and I used.

05:42.123 --> 05:44.648
What about the Library's dragon?

05:44.658 --> 05:46.617
Sorry, couldn't help but overhear.

05:46.627 --> 05:48.419
At least one side of the convo, anyway.

05:48.429 --> 05:50.153
- The Library has a dragon?
- Mm-hmm.

05:50.163 --> 05:53.824
A brindle-coat Albanian pygmy.
They call it the Bookwyrm.

05:53.835 --> 05:56.698
I read about it during dissertation
research. I assume it's real.

05:56.709 --> 05:58.236
Ask your invisible friend.

05:59.740 --> 06:01.231
Yeah, apparently.

06:01.241 --> 06:02.666
I hear they use it to send

06:02.676 --> 06:04.100
books to and from the Underworld.

06:04.110 --> 06:05.501
'Cause dragons are portals, right?

06:05.511 --> 06:08.738
Yeah, exact... ha...
the Bookwyrm's too small

06:08.748 --> 06:10.773
to send a full-size person down there.

06:10.783 --> 06:13.451
Well, what if the person was a book?

06:15.121 --> 06:18.181
Well, you said you can project
into objects, right?

06:18.191 --> 06:20.416
Yeah, I did... did say that, didn't I?

06:20.426 --> 06:23.319
- Jesus Christ.
- Okay, so this might work.

06:23.329 --> 06:27.790
Except, say, I get the key
and send it back up...

06:27.800 --> 06:29.425
it's stuck in the Satellite Library,

06:29.435 --> 06:31.160
which is on another planet, so...

06:31.170 --> 06:35.297
So, we need another Traveler.

06:35.307 --> 06:36.765
- Um.
- Oh.

06:36.775 --> 06:38.133
I only know one.

06:38.143 --> 06:40.202
And she got grabbed by
the Beast in Fillory.

06:40.212 --> 06:42.137
Victoria, she was in my class.

06:42.147 --> 06:43.839
Wait a minute, you know Victoria?

06:43.849 --> 06:45.774
Of course you know her, you... um...

06:45.784 --> 06:47.443
Wait, wait. She's not dead?

06:47.453 --> 06:50.279
No, I mean, we saved her
and she sorta took off.

06:50.289 --> 06:51.646
I have no idea where she is.

06:51.656 --> 06:54.115
If she's on Earth, I can find her.

06:54.125 --> 06:56.618
On one condition... I wanna come.

06:56.628 --> 06:58.854
I've never seen an
Albanian pygmy dragon before.

06:58.864 --> 07:00.889
This could be my only shot.

07:00.899 --> 07:02.858
- All right, fine.
- Oh, yes!

07:02.868 --> 07:04.868
This doesn't make us friends, you know.

07:10.475 --> 07:12.533
Discover anything useful for Alice?

07:12.543 --> 07:16.637
Um, yeah, actually, there's
some pretty interesting stuff

07:16.647 --> 07:18.172
on combining immunosuppressants

07:18.182 --> 07:20.808
with a crystal-based healing ritual.

07:22.753 --> 07:25.246
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

07:25.256 --> 07:28.348
Not long ago, you wanted magic so badly

07:28.358 --> 07:30.250
you fought through a memory wipe.

07:30.260 --> 07:31.593
And now...

07:31.604 --> 07:34.154
It's complicated. Uh... and personal.

07:34.164 --> 07:37.758
Fine, I'll file it under
"entitled Millennial bullshit."

07:37.768 --> 07:39.867
Let's be frank, Ms. Wicker.

07:39.878 --> 07:41.995
Whatever you and Alice
are doing, it won't work.

07:42.006 --> 07:43.096
You don't know that.

07:43.106 --> 07:44.597
I know a lot more than you.

07:44.607 --> 07:46.333
You're drunk, and you're mean.

07:46.343 --> 07:48.176
And I'm right.

07:49.513 --> 07:52.872
Look, for whatever reason,
what you had fits you.

07:52.882 --> 07:54.841
It doesn't fit Alice.

07:54.851 --> 07:56.343
If she keeps it, she'll die.

07:56.353 --> 07:58.778
- So what do I do?
- Take it back.

07:58.788 --> 08:01.280
Maybe you don't want it,
but I think you'd prefer it

08:01.290 --> 08:03.991
than to have Alice's
blood on your hands.

08:06.529 --> 08:09.722
You need magic to initiate
the transfer of magic.

08:09.732 --> 08:12.725
Alice has it all. She'll never do it.

08:12.735 --> 08:14.293
Well, fine. Go get some.

08:14.303 --> 08:16.595
Oh, sure, I'll just pop over
to the store.

08:16.605 --> 08:19.298
Actually, I think I may know someone

08:19.308 --> 08:21.200
who may be of assistance.

08:21.210 --> 08:23.202
But given their naked opportunism,

08:23.212 --> 08:25.404
I can't imagine it'll come free.

08:25.414 --> 08:27.622
What if the Fairy Queen
doesn't buy our "sick day"?

08:27.633 --> 08:29.208
Tick's a crafty son of a bitch.

08:29.218 --> 08:31.585
- He's got us covered.
- Okay.

08:32.721 --> 08:35.981
- Eliot.
- Hey, guys.

08:35.991 --> 08:37.716
We had the most wonderful adventure.

08:37.726 --> 08:40.586
We went to the Square of Time,
where no one sleeps.

08:40.596 --> 08:41.753
And it's always light.

08:41.763 --> 08:43.554
A man urinated next to me.

08:43.565 --> 08:46.058
Then we saw bards performing
on your famous Broad Way.

08:46.068 --> 08:49.160
You call it "Cats," but it's
just humans in cat greasepaint.

08:49.170 --> 08:52.063
And we tried a delicacy called pizza

08:52.073 --> 08:56.301
at an eatery that was "Family Style."

08:56.311 --> 09:00.505
Well, I am so glad that you
two had some bonding time.

09:00.515 --> 09:01.739
Hi, Todd.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.174
Hi, Dad... Eliot.

09:03.184 --> 09:05.977
Uh, Fray, did you enjoy anything at all?

09:05.987 --> 09:09.680
Earth? Or the Square of Time?

09:09.690 --> 09:12.516
I do want you to like things, you know.

09:12.526 --> 09:16.487
I can tell you want to be a good father.

09:16.497 --> 09:19.090
It's sort of sweet.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.092
I think I might grow
to despise you less.

09:22.102 --> 09:24.528
With time.

09:24.538 --> 09:26.963
Let's go with that.

09:26.973 --> 09:28.465
Not to interrupt this Hallmark moment,

09:28.475 --> 09:30.542
but Todd, you got a sec?

09:32.346 --> 09:33.445
Yeah.

09:35.349 --> 09:37.674
Wait, fairies are real?

09:37.684 --> 09:40.777
I thought Fray was just nuts.

09:40.787 --> 09:42.612
I mean, she is, but yeah,

09:42.622 --> 09:44.213
they're real and they're raging dicks,

09:44.224 --> 09:46.149
so I'm gonna need you
to keep an eye on these.

09:46.160 --> 09:49.953
Is someone going to come
looking for your weird eggs?

09:49.963 --> 09:51.600
Just make sure Fray doesn't see 'em,

09:51.611 --> 09:54.124
and if you don't hear
from me by tomorrow night,

09:54.134 --> 09:56.567
I've got another job for you.

09:57.903 --> 10:00.296
Oh! Thank gods you're back.

10:00.306 --> 10:02.331
What's with the feathers?

10:02.341 --> 10:05.034
I had to make your
"chicken pox" convincing

10:05.044 --> 10:06.802
- to the Fairy Queen.
- Mmm...

10:06.812 --> 10:09.372
Okay. As long as she bought it.

10:09.382 --> 10:10.873
Everyone in the castle did.

10:10.883 --> 10:13.341
Even Prince Fomar
and the Stone Queen headed back

10:13.351 --> 10:15.744
to their mountain/island.

10:15.754 --> 10:18.147
The Fairy Queen has no idea
you were gone.

10:18.157 --> 10:21.650
Well, that's good news, right?

10:21.660 --> 10:23.986
So what's with the face?

10:25.000 --> 10:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:36.241 --> 10:39.475
Well, this just took a dark turn.

10:41.046 --> 10:44.640
In exchange for my babies,
you want... my bathtub?

10:44.650 --> 10:45.942
You collect toes and eyeballs,

10:45.952 --> 10:47.677
and you think that's weird?

10:47.687 --> 10:51.281
You'll pardon me, but I'm a
bit taken aback by this sudden

10:51.291 --> 10:53.816
curious act of extortion.

10:53.826 --> 10:57.854
Funny, we were taken aback
by the Floaters on spikes

10:57.864 --> 10:59.455
on the side of the road.

10:59.465 --> 11:02.525
We thought you'd be alarmed by that too,

11:02.535 --> 11:06.295
given you forced us into that alliance.

11:06.305 --> 11:09.031
So what's it gonna be? Your bathtub?

11:09.041 --> 11:12.467
Or do we start making fairy
and goat cheese omelets?

11:12.477 --> 11:15.104
It's a strange deal.

11:15.114 --> 11:16.423
Even for me.

11:16.434 --> 11:17.592
Right.

11:17.603 --> 11:20.609
I should be more specific.

11:20.619 --> 11:22.044
You're giving your bathtub

11:22.054 --> 11:24.546
to the entire population of Fillory.

11:24.556 --> 11:27.215
We're gonna make a fondue
fountain out of it.

11:27.225 --> 11:28.650
It'll be fun.

11:28.660 --> 11:32.854
And since I'll have a deal
with all Fillorians,

11:32.864 --> 11:36.157
everyone will then be able to see us.

11:36.167 --> 11:37.826
I suppose you're right.

11:37.836 --> 11:39.461
No more shadow-puppeting.

11:39.471 --> 11:42.363
Just straight-up puppeting, from now on.

11:42.373 --> 11:44.698
Or hey, you could leave.

11:44.708 --> 11:47.135
There is another option, you know.

11:47.145 --> 11:50.004
I find my children, and then...

11:50.014 --> 11:51.505
You have till tomorrow.

11:51.515 --> 11:53.641
So have fun on the little egg hunt,

11:53.651 --> 11:55.143
'cause if you don't make this deal,

11:55.153 --> 11:56.477
we're about to boil and dye 'em

11:56.487 --> 11:58.746
like it's motherfucking
Easter around here.

11:58.756 --> 12:01.690
I don't know what that means.

12:02.359 --> 12:04.485
So, if I understand you correctly,

12:04.495 --> 12:08.021
you had magic before,
and you lied to me about it.

12:08.031 --> 12:12.025
Now you don't have magic and
you've come to me why, exactly?

12:12.035 --> 12:13.527
Because I need your help.

12:13.537 --> 12:15.195
Well, why should I trust you now?

12:15.205 --> 12:16.529
You've already lied to me once.

12:16.539 --> 12:18.365
She's lied to me several times too.

12:18.375 --> 12:20.500
So at least you know it's not personal.

12:20.510 --> 12:21.901
Like it wasn't personal

12:21.911 --> 12:24.371
when you swooped in
and bought my school,

12:24.381 --> 12:26.706
without so much as texting me first.

12:26.716 --> 12:29.376
Henry, trust me, better me than them.

12:29.386 --> 12:30.710
- Them.
- Anyone but me.

12:31.955 --> 12:35.515
And don't think the rest of the
board wasn't considering it.

12:35.525 --> 12:37.917
You said that your family
has reserves of magic...

12:37.927 --> 12:39.619
Limited reserves.

12:39.629 --> 12:41.955
I just need a little bit.

12:41.965 --> 12:43.389
I gave what I had to a friend.

12:43.399 --> 12:46.392
- Why the hell would you do that?
- But it is killing her.

12:46.402 --> 12:49.736
So without your help, she will
die and so will the magic.

12:51.073 --> 12:52.572
All right.

12:53.909 --> 12:57.911
Tell me about this
Voltaic Transfer you performed.

12:58.814 --> 13:01.407
Oh, shit. Margo's gonna kill me.

13:01.417 --> 13:03.142
You knew about this?

13:03.152 --> 13:04.476
I thought I was very clear

13:04.486 --> 13:06.612
about not looking in the cubbyhole.

13:06.622 --> 13:08.914
You were. That's why I looked.

13:08.924 --> 13:10.281
Fray, what are those?

13:10.291 --> 13:12.618
Fairy eggs. That Father and Margo took.

13:12.628 --> 13:14.586
- You don't know that.
- Just when I was starting

13:14.596 --> 13:18.456
to think humans aren't all bad,
they steal babies?

13:18.466 --> 13:20.958
The Fairy Queen stole you from us.

13:20.968 --> 13:23.561
- No, you bargained me away.
- I did no such thing.

13:23.571 --> 13:28.166
It was a fair deal.
This... is kidnapping.

13:28.176 --> 13:32.570
Unlike you, we have honor.

13:32.580 --> 13:35.606
You're not a fairy, Fray.

13:35.616 --> 13:39.143
Do you honestly believe
the Queen will ever see you

13:39.153 --> 13:41.412
as anything but a human?

13:41.422 --> 13:42.914
Because she won't.

13:42.924 --> 13:44.448
That's not true.

13:44.458 --> 13:48.586
Um, didn't you say
she named you Frail Human?

13:48.596 --> 13:50.454
That's pretty cold.

13:50.464 --> 13:51.956
Humans are complicated.

13:51.966 --> 13:54.425
Sometimes good people
can make bad decisions.

13:54.435 --> 13:56.760
Yeah, like, I once donated a kidney

13:56.770 --> 13:58.495
to this girl I really liked.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.030
Only, it turned out she didn't actually

14:00.040 --> 14:01.665
need it for a transplant.

14:01.675 --> 14:05.977
No matter what you think,
I know who you truly are.

14:06.547 --> 14:09.314
My daughter, and Eliot's. And...

14:10.283 --> 14:15.653
You just need to trust he did
this for a very good reason.

14:16.222 --> 14:19.323
Family is about loyalty, my love.

14:26.999 --> 14:28.966
Fuck you!

14:32.871 --> 14:35.498
Thought you said Victoria
was your best friend.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.300
<i>She slept with Josh.</i>

14:37.310 --> 14:38.801
On our Fillorian spring break.

14:38.811 --> 14:40.336
While he and I were still dating.

14:40.346 --> 14:42.205
Are you really still upset about Josh?

14:42.215 --> 14:45.007
Can't we move past that?
I mean, we were like sisters.

14:45.017 --> 14:46.174
Yeah, do you not get that

14:46.184 --> 14:47.542
that only makes it more fucked up?

14:47.552 --> 14:49.211
Sorry, could we just focus for a second?

14:49.221 --> 14:50.813
It's just kind of important.

14:50.823 --> 14:54.179
Look, even if magic was back,
and these tattoos worked,

14:54.190 --> 14:55.383
I still wouldn't help you.

14:55.393 --> 14:57.019
'Cause I don't trust you.

14:57.029 --> 14:59.762
Okay, will you just hold on
to this for a second?

15:04.702 --> 15:07.662
Victoria, be real with me.
You owe me that.

15:07.672 --> 15:10.098
I know. It's just not that simple, okay?

15:10.108 --> 15:12.167
I work with this group now,
and I can't just...

15:12.177 --> 15:13.701
Group?

15:13.711 --> 15:16.604
Yeah, it's kind of about
freedom of information.

15:16.614 --> 15:19.707
So believe me, we have no problem
dicking over the Library.

15:19.717 --> 15:22.209
It's just... we got something going on.

15:22.219 --> 15:24.178
Wait, is your boss, um...

15:24.188 --> 15:29.017
is she like 40-something,
hot, mostly rolls in ASL?

15:29.027 --> 15:32.186
Okay, so, if you know
this Harriett person,

15:32.196 --> 15:33.554
can... can you get her to help?

15:33.564 --> 15:35.256
Uh, she doesn't exactly

15:35.266 --> 15:36.890
- like me.
- Great.

15:36.900 --> 15:40.427
So Victoria hates Poppy.
Harriet hates you.

15:40.437 --> 15:42.129
So it makes perfect sense.

15:42.139 --> 15:44.265
Some people are just so emotional.

15:44.275 --> 15:47.901
Harriet does like Kady, though.

15:47.911 --> 15:50.971
Okay, great, then let's talk to Kady.

15:50.981 --> 15:52.405
Where is she?

16:02.059 --> 16:03.950
Shit.

16:03.960 --> 16:05.593
Kady.

16:07.888 --> 16:09.481
All right, I can help you.

16:09.491 --> 16:11.650
But you'll owe me a favor.

16:11.660 --> 16:13.652
Uh, what's the favor?

16:13.662 --> 16:15.729
To be determined.

16:16.431 --> 16:18.824
- Trust her.
- What could go wrong?

16:18.834 --> 16:21.092
Oh, Henry, don't be angry at me.

16:21.102 --> 16:22.660
It was buy the place

16:22.670 --> 16:24.929
or let the Hewitts liquidate
everything on eBay

16:24.939 --> 16:28.433
and turn this place into a...
an amusement park.

16:28.443 --> 16:29.667
At least I care.

16:29.677 --> 16:31.877
You care about something.

16:34.449 --> 16:36.115
Do we have a deal?

16:42.723 --> 16:44.348
Is that cocaine?

16:44.358 --> 16:47.685
It's the excretion of
a very rare magical creature.

16:47.695 --> 16:49.386
But yes, you will have to snort it.

16:49.396 --> 16:50.855
I'm sorry, what creature?

16:50.865 --> 16:52.957
I thought you had batteries.

16:52.967 --> 16:54.691
Look, you asked me for my help.

16:54.701 --> 16:56.768
This is what I have to offer.

16:57.804 --> 16:59.530
Okay, Kady is in the High Risk Ward,

16:59.540 --> 17:00.864
down the hallway over here.

17:00.874 --> 17:03.233
The ward is locked. So is Kady's room.

17:03.243 --> 17:06.069
And there's a guard station
at the entrance right here.

17:06.079 --> 17:07.904
Okay.

17:07.914 --> 17:09.540
Those squiggles are guards?

17:09.550 --> 17:11.240
Yeah, see? Little guard hats.

17:11.250 --> 17:12.842
Gotcha.

17:12.852 --> 17:14.877
So, how are we gonna get in
past all the security?

17:14.887 --> 17:17.714
We're not.
They are gonna bring her to us.

17:17.723 --> 17:19.848
By law, if they wanna
hold her involuntarily

17:19.858 --> 17:22.051
- for more than 15 days...
- They have to bring in

17:22.061 --> 17:24.220
outside doctors to certify she's crazy.

17:24.230 --> 17:27.522
Yeah, and, uh, we will be those doctors.

17:27.532 --> 17:28.891
They'll buy that?

17:28.901 --> 17:30.827
I mean, won't they check
credentials and shit?

17:30.838 --> 17:32.249
No, it's like a state hospital.

17:32.260 --> 17:34.484
Yeah, their computer systems
are older than we are.

17:34.495 --> 17:37.755
By the time they find anything
on us, we'll be long gone.

17:37.765 --> 17:38.823
Good thinking.

17:38.833 --> 17:41.425
Should I be concerned that you
both know so much about this?

17:41.435 --> 17:45.303
Mm... There was a "crazy" time.

17:46.673 --> 17:48.198
Okay, whatever, uh...

17:48.208 --> 17:51.468
But it's not like you two can just
walk out of there with a patient.

17:51.478 --> 17:54.138
No, but Kady can walk herself out

17:54.148 --> 17:56.047
if she has a security badge.

17:56.716 --> 18:00.677
And what, she's supposed to
steal one of those off a guard?

18:00.687 --> 18:02.486
No, I will.

18:06.159 --> 18:08.225
Here we are.

18:15.501 --> 18:18.727
Kady, this is Dr. London,
and... I'm sorry, Dr....

18:18.737 --> 18:21.063
Kline. Midtown Mental Health Clinic.

18:21.073 --> 18:23.466
Which is where we work.

18:23.476 --> 18:26.536
Yes. We're here to do an evaluation.

18:26.546 --> 18:29.079
Great. Mind if I sit in?

18:32.585 --> 18:35.085
No, not at all. Please do.

18:37.856 --> 18:43.719
Okay, um, so, Kady, um...

18:43.729 --> 18:47.923
Dr. Walton here tells us
that you've been suffering

18:47.933 --> 18:53.061
from delusions, and that you've
been talking to someone

18:53.071 --> 18:56.172
named, uh... Penny?

18:57.375 --> 18:59.201
Oh, um, yeah.

18:59.211 --> 19:01.903
Don't look at me. Stay cool.

19:01.913 --> 19:03.238
We're breaking you out of here.

19:03.248 --> 19:05.407
Kady, can you tell us about Penny?

19:05.417 --> 19:09.685
Yeah, uh, yeah, he was a... my ex.

19:10.421 --> 19:12.513
But I-I don't see him anymore.

19:12.523 --> 19:14.381
Quentin's gonna hand you
a security badge.

19:14.391 --> 19:15.950
It'll get you out of the ward.

19:15.960 --> 19:17.685
When you're on break, in the day room,

19:17.695 --> 19:20.696
use it to sneak out. We'll be waiting.

19:27.438 --> 19:31.131
Oh, someone has lost their badge.

19:33.744 --> 19:35.936
Great.

19:35.946 --> 19:37.438
What now?

19:37.448 --> 19:39.272
What if she doesn't take the deal?

19:39.282 --> 19:41.041
Then what do we do? Or, no...

19:41.051 --> 19:43.877
What if she takes the deal,
and then it's all-out war?

19:43.887 --> 19:45.112
Stop it.

19:45.122 --> 19:46.913
It's going to be fine.

19:46.923 --> 19:47.876
We could cut our losses.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.549
We could head back to Earth and regroup.

19:49.560 --> 19:52.318
We could finish the quest,
restore magic,

19:52.328 --> 19:54.054
and then maybe revisit this

19:54.064 --> 19:55.722
when we stand a fighting chance.

19:55.732 --> 19:59.759
You and I both sacrificed
a lot for Fillory.

19:59.769 --> 20:02.262
And now we're supposed
to just hand over the kingdom

20:02.272 --> 20:04.405
to the albino supermodel?

20:05.808 --> 20:07.333
Bitch took my eye.

20:07.343 --> 20:10.336
Hey, I don't wanna leave.

20:10.346 --> 20:12.846
But what if we're making things worse?

20:16.952 --> 20:20.749
There wasn't a blood test to
tell me to be High Queen.

20:20.760 --> 20:22.852
I chose it.

20:23.092 --> 20:26.986
And I have had to fight for
every shred of authority.

20:26.996 --> 20:28.654
And no offense,

20:28.664 --> 20:32.324
but you can't understand,
because it was handed to you.

20:32.334 --> 20:35.827
And now I'm supposed
to abandon my kingdom?

20:35.837 --> 20:39.164
Those fairy bitches wanna come
for my crown, well...

20:41.376 --> 20:44.611
I'll shove it up their fucking eggholes.

20:45.980 --> 20:50.208
Well, that raises some
anatomical questions, but...

20:50.218 --> 20:52.143
I'm on board.

20:55.637 --> 20:57.115
Maybe try the key.

20:57.125 --> 20:58.259
- What?
- Well, I don't know.

20:58.270 --> 20:59.617
Like, wave it around or something.

20:59.627 --> 21:01.286
Maybe a keyhole will appear in the wall.

21:01.296 --> 21:03.354
This is stupid.

21:03.364 --> 21:06.023
And I feel sick.

21:06.033 --> 21:07.525
Why are you here anyway?

21:07.535 --> 21:09.493
We already stuck a fork in this, Penny.

21:09.503 --> 21:11.862
- We're helping you.
- All of a sudden?

21:11.872 --> 21:16.475
After I was such a ray
of sunshine to you last time.

21:17.311 --> 21:20.237
We need you to talk to Harriet.

21:20.247 --> 21:23.006
We need her help getting the next key,

21:23.016 --> 21:24.749
so we can bring magic back.

21:25.886 --> 21:28.846
All right. And where's the next key?

21:28.856 --> 21:31.215
In the Underworld.

21:31.225 --> 21:33.925
I'm the only one who can get it, Kady.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.553
You're doing it again, aren't you?

21:36.563 --> 21:39.797
Throwing your life
at a problem to solve it.

21:40.767 --> 21:43.534
I'm tired, Penny.

21:44.237 --> 21:48.365
What couple deals with this
kinda shit on a regular basis?

21:48.375 --> 21:51.067
I thought we weren't a couple.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.935
That's not funny.

21:52.945 --> 21:55.612
It's a little funny.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.509
Hey, yell at me.

22:00.519 --> 22:03.379
I don't want to. I am tired of yelling.

22:03.389 --> 22:04.680
Yell at me.

22:04.690 --> 22:07.683
I'm getting you out of this room.

22:07.693 --> 22:08.917
Come on!

22:08.927 --> 22:11.787
Aah!

22:11.797 --> 22:13.797
Aah!

22:14.695 --> 22:16.720
Aah!

22:21.039 --> 22:23.465
Okay, Kady.

22:23.475 --> 22:25.466
Hand over the contraband.

22:25.476 --> 22:27.010
What's up?

22:31.703 --> 22:33.302
Go, team.

22:45.195 --> 22:47.976
Alice, what're you doing here?

22:47.987 --> 22:49.645
What are you?

22:49.967 --> 22:51.825
I thought you were in a psych ward.

22:51.835 --> 22:53.048
I was.

22:53.059 --> 22:54.550
Now I'm the sanest woman in America.

22:54.560 --> 22:57.019
Thanks to the 14 pills
I took this morning.

22:58.397 --> 23:00.288
I actually can't really feel anything.

23:00.298 --> 23:01.790
It's fantastic.

23:01.800 --> 23:04.092
If I didn't know better, I would say

23:04.102 --> 23:05.661
that you were just trying to cast

23:05.671 --> 23:07.596
an intermediate unlocking charm.

23:07.606 --> 23:09.598
That would mean that I have magic,

23:09.608 --> 23:11.600
which we both know is impossible.

23:11.610 --> 23:13.168
Right. Hmm.

23:13.178 --> 23:16.104
Well, don't bother.
I already looted the place.

23:16.114 --> 23:19.307
Brakebills may be closed.
Black market's not.

23:19.317 --> 23:21.076
Gotta make a living.

23:21.086 --> 23:23.778
You, uh, looking for something special?

23:24.841 --> 23:27.516
Some Boswellia.

23:27.526 --> 23:29.918
Bloodstone, steroids.

23:29.928 --> 23:32.587
Fuck me.

23:32.597 --> 23:34.022
So you do have magic.

23:34.032 --> 23:36.123
What do you know about transplants?

23:36.133 --> 23:37.692
I know you'd have to be desperate

23:37.702 --> 23:39.969
to try something that stupid.

23:40.805 --> 23:43.865
Well, who am I to judge?

23:43.875 --> 23:46.275
I almost blew a werewolf
so he'd turn me.

23:46.945 --> 23:48.369
Magical creatures...

23:48.379 --> 23:51.813
they can hang on to their magic
just fine, so...

23:53.484 --> 23:55.142
Please...

23:55.152 --> 23:56.843
if you have anything that can help me...

23:56.854 --> 23:59.513
Well, Boswellia and
Bloodstone are total bullshit.

23:59.523 --> 24:02.983
But, uh, steroids might help a little.

24:05.528 --> 24:07.454
It's more of a Band-Aid
than a cure, but...

24:07.464 --> 24:10.290
It says take two. You should take eight.

24:10.300 --> 24:12.659
- Thank you.
- We're all screwed anyway.

24:12.669 --> 24:14.936
Smoke 'em if you got 'em, hmm?

24:16.139 --> 24:18.531
<i>- Dr. Bailey,</i>

24:18.541 --> 24:20.533
<i>you're needed at nurse's station 204.</i>

24:20.543 --> 24:23.911
<i>- Dr. Bailey...</i>
- Nurse coming. Shh!

24:30.186 --> 24:32.686
I know you don't wanna talk right now.

24:33.523 --> 24:36.182
- I sure don't.
- Yeah, yeah, hate me later.

24:36.192 --> 24:39.159
I'm going to the Underworld,
Kady, give me this.

24:40.195 --> 24:42.187
You're the best thing in my life.

24:42.197 --> 24:44.598
Short life, granted, but...

24:45.534 --> 24:47.860
I want you to know I don't
regret a fucking second.

24:47.870 --> 24:49.028
Well, you should.

24:49.038 --> 24:51.864
It's crazy we lived this long.

24:51.874 --> 24:54.099
We met. We had great sex.

24:54.109 --> 24:56.143
I got to know you.

24:57.379 --> 24:59.070
I'm lucky.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.705
What's your point?

25:00.715 --> 25:03.708
Don't be mad too long.

25:03.718 --> 25:05.110
I want you to be happy.

25:05.120 --> 25:08.547
Jesus Christ.

25:08.557 --> 25:10.782
I can't be.

25:10.792 --> 25:13.559
Without you, you fucking idiot.

25:14.881 --> 25:17.047
But isn't that just adult life?

25:18.599 --> 25:20.391
Accepting your own misery.

25:20.401 --> 25:22.360
<i>- Code Green,</i>

25:22.370 --> 25:25.229
Shit. I guess they found my room.

25:25.239 --> 25:26.730
Come on.

25:26.740 --> 25:29.066
We need a new plan.
We can't just leave Kady

25:29.076 --> 25:30.434
and the key locked up in there...

25:30.444 --> 25:32.870
I know, I know. Quit being so twitchy.

25:32.880 --> 25:34.138
You look suspicious.

25:34.148 --> 25:36.073
No, I'm not. You're suspicious.

25:37.618 --> 25:39.544
<i>Attention, this is a Code Green.</i>

25:39.554 --> 25:41.646
<i>- Everyone stay in their room.</i>
- Oh, shit. Lockdown.

25:41.656 --> 25:43.113
<i>And stay calm. We are on lockdown.</i>

25:43.123 --> 25:45.448
We're gonna have to help her...

25:45.458 --> 25:48.694
<i>Attention, this is a Code Green.</i>

25:49.930 --> 25:51.588
You sure this is gonna work?

25:51.598 --> 25:52.956
It's fire safety protocol.

25:52.966 --> 25:56.126
How do you not know that?

25:58.005 --> 26:01.130
<i>Attention, please proceed
to the nearest fire exit</i>

26:01.140 --> 26:04.167
<i>and evacuate immediately.</i>
See? Works every time.

26:04.177 --> 26:06.002
How many times have you done this?

26:06.012 --> 26:07.404
<i>And evacuate immediately.</i>

26:07.414 --> 26:09.939
Keep it moving!

26:12.519 --> 26:15.078
I told you we'd figure it out.

26:16.823 --> 26:19.590
Oh, shit.

26:31.971 --> 26:34.271
Come on, let's go.

26:40.479 --> 26:42.104
Well.

26:42.114 --> 26:44.139
Alice is gone.

26:44.149 --> 26:46.308
Might be time to use this.

26:46.318 --> 26:48.985
To cast a locator spell.

26:52.290 --> 26:55.316
Reminds me of the old days.

26:55.326 --> 26:56.684
I don't wanna know.

27:03.534 --> 27:06.694
This magic... it looks different.

27:06.704 --> 27:08.329
It feels different.

27:08.339 --> 27:11.832
If it's working, let's not split hairs.

27:11.842 --> 27:14.569
Find her.

27:14.579 --> 27:18.373
Wait a minute. What's Alice doing there?

27:18.383 --> 27:22.017
I'm blind. Are you going to tell me?

27:24.179 --> 27:26.238
Eliot, Fray found the eggs.

27:26.257 --> 27:28.182
She was upset and tried to take them.

27:28.192 --> 27:30.751
I stopped her, but she ran away
and we can't find her.

27:30.761 --> 27:32.153
This is not good.

27:32.163 --> 27:34.689
And real bad timing, El.

27:35.392 --> 27:40.594
Yeah, Fen, we are about to
have a delicate negotiation,

27:40.604 --> 27:42.593
and while I am worried
about our daughter,

27:42.604 --> 27:45.124
we need to put a pin in it. There's
nothing we can do about it right now.

27:45.135 --> 27:47.200
- Perhaps I can help.
- Oh, Fray.

27:47.210 --> 27:49.869
We've been having quite a talk.

27:49.879 --> 27:53.507
Eggs and portals and quests.

27:53.517 --> 27:56.742
So much going on I didn't know about.

27:56.752 --> 27:58.899
We really should discuss.

27:59.956 --> 28:01.455
Crap.

28:02.714 --> 28:04.374
Fray? How could you?

28:04.384 --> 28:09.120
Like you said, family loyalty.

28:11.291 --> 28:13.491
I've considered your offer.

28:14.461 --> 28:18.154
And I propose a counter.
Don't hurt my children.

28:18.164 --> 28:20.289
I won't hurt yours.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.559
Wait. What?

28:22.569 --> 28:24.576
- No.
- Don't you touch her.

28:24.587 --> 28:26.294
But my Queen...

28:26.305 --> 28:30.533
Let's just all calm down
and talk about this, okay?

28:30.543 --> 28:33.635
- No one needs to get hurt.
- I agree.

28:33.645 --> 28:37.167
I... I helped you. I...

28:37.178 --> 28:38.741
Yes.

28:39.851 --> 28:44.121
You're a perfect specimen
of human duplicity.

28:44.809 --> 28:47.292
Betrayed your own parents.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.385
Why would I ever trust you?

28:50.395 --> 28:54.698
I just... found the eggs and
couldn't believe they would...

28:55.669 --> 28:58.326
I just wanted all this to stop.

28:58.336 --> 29:00.028
So let's stop this.

29:06.812 --> 29:08.504
We gotta give her the eggs.

29:08.515 --> 29:11.072
There's gotta be another way.
That's our only leverage.

29:11.082 --> 29:14.342
I know, but she's my daughter.

29:14.352 --> 29:16.377
We have a whole country to think about.

29:16.387 --> 29:19.522
I can't be the dad that turns
his back on his kid.

29:20.691 --> 29:22.683
I'm not your daughter.
I'm just a human who...

29:24.194 --> 29:27.029
- What're you saying?
- What?

29:27.545 --> 29:29.374
Explain.

29:30.735 --> 29:32.124
Now...

29:32.858 --> 29:35.863
or it's poached eggs tonight.

29:40.587 --> 29:42.374
Fray isn't yours.

29:43.647 --> 29:46.206
Your real daughter died
during childbirth.

29:47.869 --> 29:49.663
She died?

29:49.835 --> 29:52.334
Oh, gods, I...

29:53.418 --> 29:57.412
Oh, no. Oh, no.

30:01.597 --> 30:06.067
That is the sound
of your leverage dying.

30:07.303 --> 30:11.154
You'd better shake on this deal
while you still can.

30:15.449 --> 30:17.874
No, no way.

30:17.885 --> 30:19.627
- Please.
- No.

30:19.638 --> 30:21.530
I'm asking for this favor.

30:35.521 --> 30:37.646
Okay, okay, look.

30:37.656 --> 30:42.217
Look, I'm... I am grateful for
everything you did for me.

30:42.227 --> 30:43.985
For Penny.

30:43.995 --> 30:46.421
So how about this?

30:46.431 --> 30:48.723
What if...

30:53.371 --> 30:55.338
Then we both get what we want.

31:07.017 --> 31:09.510
So we're gonna rob the Library?

31:09.520 --> 31:11.712
- Oh, awesome.
- No, not awesome.

31:11.722 --> 31:13.247
Stupid.

31:13.257 --> 31:15.516
It is hard enough
to sneak one person in there.

31:15.526 --> 31:17.552
How the hell are they gonna
get the whole group in?

31:17.562 --> 31:19.020
It's the dumbest plan I've ever...

31:21.031 --> 31:23.231
Uh, Penny's got some notes.

31:24.809 --> 31:26.667
You said you wanted to do this.

31:26.678 --> 31:28.970
You don't know
the defenses this place has.

31:28.980 --> 31:30.873
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

31:30.883 --> 31:34.083
Oh, are you the only one who
gets to do something stupid?

31:36.515 --> 31:38.380
You've been waiting to say that.

31:38.390 --> 31:40.505
I know what I'm doing.

31:40.516 --> 31:42.542
My head's clear now.

31:42.552 --> 31:44.677
You got me out. We'll get the key out.

31:44.687 --> 31:47.680
You just... you have to go,
if that's what you wanna do.

31:47.690 --> 31:49.038
Yeah, don't get me wrong.

31:49.049 --> 31:51.283
Being on the astral plane's great.

31:51.293 --> 31:53.593
Just a little over being stuck here.

31:55.464 --> 31:58.690
Bringing magic back is
the only way I see out of this.

32:00.369 --> 32:04.337
Wouldn't it be funny
if we made it out of this?

32:05.006 --> 32:08.507
I'd laugh pretty hard.

32:09.510 --> 32:12.671
Look, this tweaker's worried
the key's already moving on,

32:12.681 --> 32:16.140
so I gotta go be a book
and get eaten by a dragon.

32:16.150 --> 32:18.910
Yeah, I heard that one before.

32:18.920 --> 32:20.474
I love you.

32:21.322 --> 32:24.323
I'm sorry we're cursed.

32:31.732 --> 32:33.575
He's gone.

32:35.002 --> 32:37.614
What, like, gone? Gone gone? Like...

32:38.106 --> 32:40.998
Like, to the Library gone?

32:41.008 --> 32:43.742
Gone to the Underworld, gone.

32:44.524 --> 32:47.292
So let's not fuck it up on our end.

32:56.090 --> 32:57.547
Are you sure you wanna do this?

32:57.557 --> 32:59.583
It's not exactly like everyone thinks...

32:59.593 --> 33:01.518
Jonesing for blood.

33:01.528 --> 33:03.553
Watching everyone you know die.

33:03.563 --> 33:06.889
That is, if you
don't kill them yourself.

33:06.899 --> 33:09.626
You don't seem like the fan
girls who usually come to me.

33:09.636 --> 33:13.696
You seem... smart.
Too smart to want all this.

33:13.706 --> 33:15.264
I don't want it.

33:15.274 --> 33:18.134
- Then why...
- It's none of your business.

33:18.144 --> 33:21.203
Well, then, no.

33:21.214 --> 33:24.498
Becoming a creature...
no offense... is the only way

33:24.509 --> 33:26.075
I can keep my magic.

33:26.085 --> 33:27.686
Why are you trying to talk me out of it?

33:27.697 --> 33:29.896
I'm not. But are you so sure

33:29.907 --> 33:31.213
this'll do what you want it to?

33:31.223 --> 33:32.881
No, but I'm out of options,

33:32.891 --> 33:34.750
so will you take my money or not?

33:37.095 --> 33:39.829
All right.

33:48.506 --> 33:50.498
Alice, let's go.

33:50.508 --> 33:52.901
Jesus, how did you find me?

33:52.911 --> 33:55.603
Spent some desperate times
around here looking for magic.

33:55.613 --> 33:57.739
All I found were shitty vampires.

33:57.749 --> 33:59.274
Can we please go?

33:59.284 --> 34:02.418
No, just leave. Continue.

34:05.923 --> 34:07.482
Leave or I break it.

34:07.492 --> 34:08.983
Ah! Get off me!

34:08.993 --> 34:10.751
How did you do that?

34:10.761 --> 34:12.786
Ah. Get out.

34:12.797 --> 34:14.255
No, I gave you my money.

34:14.264 --> 34:18.092
Not enough to deal with
hedgewitch Buffy. Good luck.

34:18.101 --> 34:19.601
Out!

34:21.772 --> 34:24.031
When we said we'd explore our options,

34:24.041 --> 34:26.867
I meant research,
not joining the undead.

34:26.877 --> 34:29.268
I researched. This is the only way.

34:29.279 --> 34:31.471
No, it isn't. This is reckless.

34:31.481 --> 34:35.784
Okay. I don't need your help,
you condescending bitch.

34:41.658 --> 34:44.125
Aaaaaah!

34:48.665 --> 34:51.190
Oh, no, Julia.

35:02.310 --> 35:05.078
I transferred it all back.

35:07.884 --> 35:09.474
I'm sorry.

35:09.484 --> 35:13.045
All you did was try to help me,
and I almost killed you.

35:13.055 --> 35:17.950
Yeah, well, my magic
almost killed you, so...

35:17.960 --> 35:19.218
I guess we're even.

35:19.228 --> 35:22.429
We're not,
but that's nice of you to say.

35:24.066 --> 35:28.167
Ever since Quentin
dragged me back, I've just...

35:29.137 --> 35:30.995
I mean, what do people in limbo do?

35:31.005 --> 35:33.306
It's excruciating.

35:34.976 --> 35:37.636
You know, and I just thought
maybe if I could just...

35:37.646 --> 35:40.914
Fix it?

35:42.016 --> 35:43.916
I know the feeling.

35:44.752 --> 35:47.320
Really.

35:48.589 --> 35:51.215
I still see Reynard.

35:51.225 --> 35:52.620
You do?

35:52.631 --> 35:57.363
Awake, in my dreams, yep.

35:58.231 --> 36:00.524
Do you think maybe it's because...

36:00.534 --> 36:03.869
I think it's because it happened.

36:05.072 --> 36:08.540
And there's nothing magic
about it anymore.

36:09.009 --> 36:12.369
When things happen, they leave a mark.

36:12.379 --> 36:15.546
Figuring out how to deal
with it takes time.

36:17.951 --> 36:21.411
I get what Quentin always saw in you.

36:21.421 --> 36:23.388
You're brave.

36:24.391 --> 36:25.449
Just stubborn.

36:25.459 --> 36:28.418
I think that's why you can hold it.

36:28.428 --> 36:31.554
All the pain, and all the shit
you didn't ask for,

36:31.564 --> 36:34.190
that's what made you you.

36:34.200 --> 36:37.193
And that's why this magic fits.

36:37.203 --> 36:41.764
Maybe sometimes life is... random

36:41.774 --> 36:43.299
and unfair.

36:43.309 --> 36:46.569
You know, it doesn't always
ask our permission.

36:46.579 --> 36:48.678
It just is.

36:50.383 --> 36:52.316
Honestly...

36:53.486 --> 36:56.920
It still makes me sick
to think that it was his.

36:59.125 --> 37:02.559
Except that it's not his anymore, Julia.

37:04.730 --> 37:07.523
I felt it. It... it's yours.

37:07.534 --> 37:09.591
For whatever reason.

37:12.237 --> 37:14.830
So what are you gonna do with it?

37:26.817 --> 37:29.954
Fen.

37:29.965 --> 37:33.032
Maybe you shouldn't be holding
sharp objects right now.

37:33.043 --> 37:34.868
My father was a knife maker.

37:34.879 --> 37:37.146
This is how I've always calmed down.

37:51.168 --> 37:53.167
When our daughter was born,

37:54.293 --> 37:55.969
they took her away.

37:56.684 --> 38:00.115
They wouldn't let me hold her.
I never heard her cry.

38:01.651 --> 38:03.877
I should have known.

38:03.887 --> 38:06.012
How could I not know?

38:07.657 --> 38:11.317
God, I was so ready to believe Fray.

38:11.327 --> 38:13.987
I think deep down I thought...

38:16.199 --> 38:21.461
If we just felt like a family,

38:21.472 --> 38:25.031
if I just willed it hard enough,

38:25.041 --> 38:26.665
then that would be real.

38:26.675 --> 38:30.177
'Cause this...

38:31.080 --> 38:33.139
How am I supposed to live with it?

38:33.149 --> 38:35.241
Oh, God.

38:35.251 --> 38:38.877
God, oh, Fen, I'm so sorry.

38:38.887 --> 38:40.980
You would've been... um.

38:40.990 --> 38:45.250
No, you were such a great mom.

38:45.845 --> 38:51.131
And... I was a shitty father
and an even shittier husband.

38:52.711 --> 38:55.388
You deserve so much better than this.

38:57.048 --> 39:00.273
I'm gonna need some time.

39:01.109 --> 39:03.101
I can't be in Fillory right now.

39:03.111 --> 39:05.570
Okay, okay.

39:25.133 --> 39:26.944
Hey.

39:27.788 --> 39:30.285
Okay, dude. Spill.

39:30.296 --> 39:32.596
What's up?

39:32.606 --> 39:36.563
What if... Penny doesn't find Benedict

39:36.574 --> 39:40.137
or the Key? Or he gets caught
by a Librarian, or we do,

39:40.147 --> 39:42.906
or any part
of this ridiculous plan fails?

39:42.916 --> 39:45.376
It seems like you're worrying
about a lot of stuff

39:45.386 --> 39:46.743
you can't control, here.

39:46.753 --> 39:50.747
Everything that we're doing,
if we mess it up,

39:50.757 --> 39:53.917
it's not just me who suffers.

39:53.927 --> 39:56.119
It's not just us who suffers.

39:56.129 --> 39:59.089
We're talking about
the entire multiverse.

39:59.099 --> 40:00.757
No, it's not the multiverse.

40:00.767 --> 40:02.492
Magic doesn't exist in this universe.

40:02.502 --> 40:04.494
It doesn't mean it's gone
in alternate realities.

40:04.504 --> 40:07.672
- That is not the point.
- Oh, boy.

40:08.974 --> 40:10.772
What're you doing?

40:10.783 --> 40:12.541
Short-circuiting your panic attack.

40:12.552 --> 40:14.686
It's getting tiresome.

40:17.623 --> 40:19.248
Okay, I'm confused.

40:19.258 --> 40:21.584
It's sweet how much you care
about your friends.

40:21.594 --> 40:23.553
Even the ones that don't like you.

40:23.563 --> 40:25.120
Let's just have some fun.

40:25.130 --> 40:27.790
Seems like the chances of
everyone surviving

40:27.800 --> 40:29.792
go up if we do that.

40:46.118 --> 40:48.010
<i>Your eggs, I take it, are fine?</i>

40:48.020 --> 40:49.126
Yes.

40:49.137 --> 40:50.368
What have you done with Fray?

40:50.379 --> 40:52.691
She did not want to return with me.

40:53.158 --> 40:55.291
Her fate is her own.

40:57.329 --> 40:58.853
Is the rest done?

40:58.863 --> 41:02.524
The bathtub now belongs
to the people of Fillory.

41:02.534 --> 41:04.426
May they be clean forever.

41:04.436 --> 41:08.296
I'm sure they'll appreciate the gift.

41:08.306 --> 41:09.964
While we're at it.

41:09.974 --> 41:12.466
What was your end game anyway?

41:12.476 --> 41:16.838
The whimsical demands,
forced alliances...

41:16.848 --> 41:20.274
Was it all just standard
"terraforming for world

41:20.284 --> 41:22.309
domination mega-villain" bullshit?

41:23.888 --> 41:26.647
It's a sign of your human privilege

41:26.657 --> 41:29.049
that you see things so simply.

41:29.059 --> 41:32.119
Oh, but it is simple, Lady...
you made us look crazy.

41:32.129 --> 41:35.021
And aligning with the Floaters
made us look stupid.

41:35.031 --> 41:36.857
But now everyone will understand

41:36.867 --> 41:38.992
what was really happening to us.

41:39.002 --> 41:42.329
- Will they?
- You made the deal.

41:42.339 --> 41:44.531
Everyone can see you now.

41:44.541 --> 41:48.034
True. And they can see you too.

41:48.044 --> 41:51.179
Whoa, there! Whoa, whoa!

41:51.882 --> 41:54.241
- Why are we stopping?
- I don't know.

41:54.251 --> 41:56.743
Children of Earth have been
making a mess of things here

41:56.753 --> 41:59.412
for some time.

41:59.422 --> 42:01.347
I can no longer help you.

42:01.357 --> 42:04.183
Help us with what?

42:07.897 --> 42:09.088
- Eliot...
- This is sounding

42:09.098 --> 42:12.158
a little too "Les Miz" for my liking.

42:12.168 --> 42:14.394
- Okay, Bambi? They're armed.
- Ah!

42:16.238 --> 42:18.563
- Where the hell is she?
- Oh, shit.

42:18.573 --> 42:22.534
- She planned this.
- Oh, my God!

42:24.378 --> 42:26.070
Hold on! Hold on!

42:26.080 --> 42:28.739
Aah! Aah!

42:28.749 --> 42:31.984
I'm your Queen, you motherfuckers!
