WEBVTT

00:07.608 --> 00:08.379
( laughing )

00:08.379 --> 00:09.540
HEY, AVERY.

00:09.540 --> 00:11.242
SWEETHEART, WHAT ARE YOU
LAUGHING AT?

00:11.242 --> 00:13.013
THIS REPORT CARD.

00:13.013 --> 00:16.417
WHAT HAVE WE TOLD YOU ABOUT
LAUGHING AT TYLER'S
REPORT CARD?

00:16.417 --> 00:18.589
OKAY, WHICH ONE
OF THE THREE STOOGES

00:18.589 --> 00:21.052
DID THEY COMPARE HIM TO
THIS TIME?

00:21.052 --> 00:23.294
NO, NO, THIS IS MY REPORT CARD.

00:23.294 --> 00:25.526
YOUR REPORT CARD?
THOSE DON'T MAKE US LAUGH.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.528
THEY JUST MAKE US FEEL--
WHAT'S THE WORD?

00:27.528 --> 00:31.402
HEBETUDINOUS?
I WAS GONNA DAY "DUMB."

00:31.402 --> 00:33.534
THIS LOOKS GREAT!
I DON'T SEE WHAT'S
FUNNY HERE.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.566
YEAH, I HAVEN'T SEEN
THAT MANY "A's" IN A ROW

00:35.566 --> 00:38.539
SINCE AARDVARK AUTO
OPENED THAT ANNEX
OVER ON AVENUE A.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.672
NO, NO. JUST READ
THE HILARIOUS COMMENT
FROM MRS. KRUPP.

00:41.672 --> 00:43.314
(laughs )
SHE KILLS ME.

00:43.314 --> 00:45.646
"AVERY IS AN OUTSTANDING,
CONSCIENTIOUS STUDENT.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.418
"IT JUST SEEMS
SHE'S A BIT TOO SERIOUS

00:47.418 --> 00:49.480
AND COULD HAVE MORE FUN
WITH HER SCHOOLWORK."

00:49.480 --> 00:51.382
SHE THINKS I'M NO FUN.

00:51.382 --> 00:54.385
ISN'T THAT HILARIOUS?
HA HA HA HA HA HA!

00:54.385 --> 00:56.287
WHY AREN'T YOU LAUGHING?

00:56.287 --> 00:57.828
YOU DON'T AGREE WITH HER,
DO YOU?

00:58.829 --> 01:00.561
WHY ARE YOU
LOOKING AT EACH OTHER?

01:00.561 --> 01:05.065
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF,
I'M A LITTLE SCARED.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.437
YOU DON'T THINK I'M FUN?
UH, NO,

01:06.437 --> 01:08.499
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT
WE'RE SAYING, SWEETHEART.

01:08.499 --> 01:11.472
OH, SO YOU DO THINK I'M FUN.
UH--

01:11.472 --> 01:13.274
I'M GETTING REALLY FRUSTRATED
WITH THE TWO OF YOU

01:13.274 --> 01:15.346
NOT HAVING THE COURAGE TO
JUST BE UP FRONT WITH ME.

01:15.346 --> 01:17.148
THIS ISN'T ABOUT US,
SWEETHEART.

01:17.148 --> 01:19.610
THIS IS ABOUT YOU
NOT BEING ANY FUN.

01:19.610 --> 01:21.452
DANG IT!

01:21.452 --> 01:24.855
WOW. MY OWN PARENTS
DON'T THINK I'M FUN.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.660
STAN, YOU THINK I'M FUN,
RIGHT?

01:29.660 --> 01:33.524
AVERY, I THINK
YOU'RE VERY, VERY...SMART.

01:33.524 --> 01:35.095
THAT'S NOT WHAT I ASKED.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.667
I ASKED IF I WAS FUN.

01:36.667 --> 01:38.369
YOUR SHOES ARE FUN.

01:38.369 --> 01:40.731
THEY'RE, LIKE, FROM MARS
OR SOMETHING.

01:40.731 --> 01:42.303
SO YOU DON'T THINK I'M FUN.

01:42.303 --> 01:44.635
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE FUN,
YOU KNOW YOU'RE FUN.

01:44.635 --> 01:46.177
ISN'T THAT ENOUGH?

01:46.177 --> 01:48.108
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
EVERYBODY ELSE?

01:48.108 --> 01:49.780
UH...LOOK OUT THE WINDOW!

01:49.780 --> 01:52.543
IT'S WHATEVER BOY BAND
IS CURRENTLY POPULAR!

01:54.445 --> 01:55.546
HEY!

01:55.546 --> 01:58.449
I'M FUN, AND I'M GONNA PROVE IT!

01:58.449 --> 02:01.452
Stan: KINDA HARD TO
MAKE THAT FACE FUN.

02:01.452 --> 02:03.154
BUT HEY, LET'S TRY.

02:03.154 --> 02:06.797
LOOK. SHE'S GOT A BALLOON HEAD!

02:06.797 --> 02:09.230
HEY, LET'S LET THE AIR
OUT OF HER!

02:12.503 --> 02:14.565
OH, THIS IS HILARIOUS.

02:14.565 --> 02:16.837
WELL, AT LEAST I'M FUN.

02:16.837 --> 02:19.170
♪♪

02:35.926 --> 02:38.629
Stan: WHOA-HO-HO!
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

02:38.629 --> 02:40.931
WHERE'S THE BACON-WRAPPED CAT?

02:40.931 --> 02:45.296
MUST BE OUT THERE WITH
YOUR INVISIBLE POPULAR BOY BAND.

02:45.296 --> 02:49.169
I'VE BEEN BAMBOOZLED,
HAVEN'T I?
YES.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.603
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET ME
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT BEING FUN
AGAIN, AREN'T YOU?

02:52.603 --> 02:54.605
YES.

02:54.605 --> 02:58.479
STAN, IT REALLY HURTS
MY FEELINGS THAT PEOPLE
DON'T THINK I'M FUN.

02:58.479 --> 03:02.483
IT'S NO BIG DEAL,
IT'S JUST THE PEOPLE
WHO KNOW YOU BEST.

03:02.483 --> 03:06.217
SERIOUSLY, STAN,
I HATE THAT EVERYBODY
SEES ME THAT WAY.

03:06.217 --> 03:08.819
I KNOW I'M FUN.
HOW CAN I SHOW EVERYBODY ELSE?

03:08.819 --> 03:11.262
DON'T LURE THEM INTO
YOUR FRILLY LITTLE PRISON

03:11.262 --> 03:12.663
PROMISING BACON CATS?

03:14.194 --> 03:16.727
CAN I USE YOUR LAPTOP
TO WATCH A VIDEO
MY FRIENDS MADE?

03:16.727 --> 03:18.229
YEAH, WHATEVER.

03:18.229 --> 03:20.200
NO LAUGHING, SINGING,
OR GIGGLING.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.933
WHY DO PEOPLE
THINK I'M NOT FUN?

03:22.933 --> 03:25.376
MAYBE THE TIES ARE
GIVING THE WRONG MESSAGE.

03:25.376 --> 03:26.977
NO, "12-YEAR-OLD
INVESTMENT BANKER"

03:26.977 --> 03:30.241
IS COMING THROUGH
LOUD AND CLEAR.

03:30.241 --> 03:32.743
HA HA HA HA!
CHLOE!

03:32.743 --> 03:34.945
I'M SORRY. THIS
MOVIE IS HILARIOUS.

03:34.945 --> 03:37.948
MY FRIENDS ARE SO FUN.
THAT'S IT!

03:37.948 --> 03:41.221
YOU'RE GONNA HANG AROUND
CHLOE'S FRIENDS AND HOPE
THEY MAKE YOU FUN?

03:41.221 --> 03:44.255
NO! I'M SUPPOSED TO
WRITE A PAPER FOR MRS. KRUPP.

03:44.255 --> 03:47.358
INSTEAD, I'LL MAKE A MOVIE,
AND SHE'LL SEE HOW FUN I AM.

03:47.358 --> 03:49.260
AND EVERYONE IN THE FAMILY
CAN BE IN IT,

03:49.260 --> 03:51.432
AND THEN THEY'LL SEE
HOW FUN I AM.

03:51.432 --> 03:52.963
I'M GONNA START
RIGHT NOW!

03:52.963 --> 03:54.435
HEY!

03:54.435 --> 03:57.237
THANKS, STAN,
FOR ALL YOUR HELP.
I REALLY OWE YA.

03:58.369 --> 04:00.240
AAAH!

04:00.240 --> 04:02.943
HEY! HOW ABOUT THAT
BACON-WRAPPED CAT?!

04:06.417 --> 04:09.680
FIRST OFF, THANK YOU ALL
SO MUCH FOR HELPING ME
WITH MY MOVIE.

04:09.680 --> 04:13.824
IT'S SO EARLY!
I HAVEN'T EVEN HAD
MY FIRST COFF OF CUPPEE.

04:13.824 --> 04:15.956
DID WE HAVE TO BE HERE
AT SIX A.M.?

04:15.956 --> 04:19.860
IT'S ACTUALLY FIVE.
I RESET THE CLOCKS
TO GET A HEAD START.

04:19.860 --> 04:23.294
DADDY'S HEAD STILL
HASN'T STARTED.

04:23.294 --> 04:25.296
AAH! HERE I AM!

04:25.296 --> 04:27.968
Avery: ALL RIGHTIE...

04:27.968 --> 04:30.841
HERE IS EVERYONE'S
ASSIGNMENTS AND SCHEDULES.

04:30.841 --> 04:32.973
CHLOE! YOU'RE MY
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.806
YOU'LL BE AT MY SIDE
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

04:35.806 --> 04:37.578
CAN I SAY "ACTION"?
ABSOLUTELY.

04:37.578 --> 04:40.481
ACTION!
AAH! OH...

04:40.481 --> 04:42.913
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN.

04:42.913 --> 04:45.886
SO, WHAT'S THIS MOVIE ABOUT?

04:45.886 --> 04:49.820
AH. IT'S THE TIMELESS STORY
OF A MISUNDERSTOOD TEEN

04:49.820 --> 04:53.524
STRUGGLING TO FIND ACCEPTANCE
IN A HARSH AND JUDGMENTAL WORLD.

04:53.524 --> 04:55.926
OH.
OH.
OKAY.

04:55.926 --> 04:58.068
IT'S ABOUT A BOY
WHO SWAPS BRAINS
WITH A DOG.

04:58.068 --> 05:00.431
OH!
OH!
OH!

05:00.431 --> 05:01.872
I CALL IT...

05:02.903 --> 05:04.375
"FREAKY FIDO."

05:04.375 --> 05:08.038
MARKING HIS TERRITORY
AT A THEATER NEAR YOU.

05:08.038 --> 05:09.540
I LIKE IT.

05:09.540 --> 05:12.012
BUT IS ANYBODY GONNA
BELIEVE A TALKING DOG?

05:12.012 --> 05:15.986
Stan: I COULD FREAK YOU OUT
SO BAD RIGHT NOW.

05:15.986 --> 05:18.489
MY BIGGEST CHALLENGE
IS FINDING A BOY

05:18.489 --> 05:22.393
WHO CAN CONVINCE EVERYONE
HE HAS THE BRAINS OF A DOG.

05:23.694 --> 05:24.895
OH, NO.

05:24.895 --> 05:27.057
NO, I'M NOT PLAYING
A DOG IN YOUR MOVIE.

05:27.057 --> 05:29.800
NO, NO, YOU'RE NOT.
STAN'S THE DOG.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.562
YOU'RE THE BOY
WITH THE DOG'S BRAINS.

05:31.562 --> 05:33.864
DO YOU KNOW
HOW INSULTING THAT IS?

05:33.864 --> 05:38.509
OH, IF YOU PORTRAY MY BRAIN
RESPECTFULLY, I'M OKAY WITH IT.

05:38.509 --> 05:41.972
GOOFY, DOG-BRAIN TYLER?
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK OF ME?

05:41.972 --> 05:45.546
WELL, I HAVE MORE DEPTH
AND DIGNITY THAN ANYONE
GIVES ME CREDIT FOR.

05:45.546 --> 05:48.879
YOU HAVE A LOVE SCENE
WITH NIKKI.
LET'S SHOOT THIS MOVIE!

05:48.879 --> 05:51.081
ACTION!!!
OHH!

06:01.562 --> 06:03.594
HELLO, CAST.

06:03.594 --> 06:05.796
FIRST OFF, I'D LIKE TO
WELCOME NIKKI

06:05.796 --> 06:08.038
IN THE ROLE OF
TYLER'S LOVE INTEREST.

06:08.038 --> 06:10.841
IT WILL CERTAINLY
BE A CHALLENGE.

06:10.841 --> 06:12.072
HEY!

06:12.072 --> 06:13.744
OH, NO, NO, NO.

06:13.744 --> 06:16.807
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE I'M NOT
THE LEAST BIT INTERESTED IN YOU.

06:16.807 --> 06:19.780
YOU'LL CHANGE YOUR TUNE
AFTER YOU SEE ME
ROLL OVER AND PLAY DEAD.

06:19.780 --> 06:22.413
THAT MIGHT HELP.

06:22.413 --> 06:24.054
ALL RIGHT, IN MAKING THIS MOVIE,

06:24.054 --> 06:26.457
I WANT YOU ALL
TO HAVE A LOT OF FUN.

06:26.457 --> 06:29.389
IT'S NOT A SUGGESTION;
THAT'S A DIRECT ORDER.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.161
THAT WAS A JOKE.

06:31.161 --> 06:33.093
HA HA HA HA HA!

06:33.093 --> 06:34.895
HA HA HA HA HA--
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.066
FINE.

06:37.768 --> 06:40.170
RIGHT. HERE'S
EVERYONE'S SCRIPTS.

06:40.170 --> 06:42.102
DO ALL THE LINES
EXACTLY AS WRITTEN

06:42.102 --> 06:44.074
WITH NO DEVIATION
OR INDEPENDENT THOUGHT.

06:44.074 --> 06:46.106
( all laughing )

06:46.106 --> 06:47.578
THAT'S NOT A JOKE.

06:47.578 --> 06:48.909
( all sigh )

06:51.141 --> 06:53.143
WHY DID I AGREE
TO DO THIS?

06:53.143 --> 06:55.516
I HATE ACTING!
I HATE IT!

06:55.516 --> 06:57.688
YOU REALLY DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS IF--

06:57.688 --> 07:00.691
I WAS ONLY ACTING
THAT I HATE ACTING.

07:01.822 --> 07:02.823
I LOVE ACTING.

07:02.823 --> 07:05.626
WOW. THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.097
THANKS.

07:07.097 --> 07:09.760
BUT...NO, IT WASN'T.

07:09.760 --> 07:12.463
I WANT TO BE GOOD,
BUT I AM NOT.

07:12.463 --> 07:15.666
( sniffling )
ACTING WAS MY DREAM
COMING TO AMERICA,

07:15.666 --> 07:17.638
BUT I'LL JUST NEVER
BE ANY GOOD, TYLER,

07:17.638 --> 07:19.039
I JUST WON'T!

07:19.039 --> 07:21.812
( sobbing )
OKAY, I SEE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

07:23.644 --> 07:26.116
OH, NO, I'M--I'M SORRY, I--

07:26.116 --> 07:28.619
HA! ACTING!

07:28.619 --> 07:31.221
I WAS ONLY ACTING
THAT I WAS STINKY AT ACTING

07:31.221 --> 07:33.183
WHEN REALLY, I AM VERY GOOD. NO?

07:33.183 --> 07:35.125
YEAH, YOU'RE AWESOME!

07:35.125 --> 07:37.658
I TOTALLY THOUGHT
YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE STINKY.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.760
BUT NOW I FEEL LIKE
SUCH A FOOL.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.092
I FEEL SO FOOLISH
AND...

07:42.092 --> 07:44.034
SO EMBARRASSED.

07:45.536 --> 07:47.568
ACTING.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.670
NO, THAT REALLY WASN'T.

07:52.743 --> 07:54.545
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I THINK ACTING
IN THIS MOVIE

07:54.545 --> 07:55.976
IS GONNA BE FUN
FOR US, TOO.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.678
YEAH, ALTHOUGH I THINK
WE'RE A LITTLE YOUNG

07:57.678 --> 08:00.210
TO BE PLAYING THE PARENTS
OF OUR CHILDREN.

08:00.210 --> 08:02.182
IT TAKES ME BACK
TO WHEN YOU AND I

08:02.182 --> 08:04.815
USED TO DO COMMUNITY THEATER.

08:04.815 --> 08:08.118
(Brooklyn accent):
AGNES! I KNOW
YOU GOT THE AMNESIA,

08:08.118 --> 08:09.690
BUT I STILL GOTTA ASK YA,

08:09.690 --> 08:12.262
WHERE WAS YOU
ON THE NIGHT OF THE FOURTH?

08:12.262 --> 08:15.125
(accent)
I DON'T REMEMBER, BUTCHY.
MY MEMORY'S ON THE FRITZ.

08:15.125 --> 08:18.729
HUH? THEN WHY WAS THIS GUN
IN YOUR HANDBAG, DOLL?

08:18.729 --> 08:21.772
YOU MEAN THE GAT?
THE HEATER? THE WIDOW-MAKER?

08:21.772 --> 08:23.203
I DON'T REMEMBER, BUTCHY.

08:23.203 --> 08:26.006
I REMEMBER ALL THE NAMES
FOR GUNS, BUT NOTHIN' ELSE.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.639
WELL, MAYBE A LITTLE
MOUTH-TO-MOUTH

08:28.639 --> 08:31.141
WILL SHAKE A FEW
MEMORIES LOOSE!

08:31.141 --> 08:33.283
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
UM--

08:33.283 --> 08:35.085
WELL, MOMMY'S GOT
SOMETHING IN HER NOSE,

08:35.085 --> 08:36.787
AND I WAS JUST
TRYING TO SEE IT.

08:36.787 --> 08:40.591
I'VE GOT SMALL FINGERS.
I CAN GET UP IN THAT THING.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.995
WAIT RIGHT HERE.
I'M COMING BACK WITH TOOLS.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.929
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
IN THIS SCENE--
ACTION!

08:48.929 --> 08:50.801
NOT READY YET.
CUT!

08:50.801 --> 08:52.763
YOU CAN SAY "CUT"
IF WE HAVEN'T STARTED YET.

08:52.763 --> 08:54.705
THAT'S LUNCH!
THAT'S NOT LUNCH.

08:54.705 --> 08:57.037
THAT'S A WRAP!

08:58.168 --> 09:00.270
ALL RIGHT, DAD,
YOU WILL SIT HERE.

09:00.270 --> 09:02.172
MOM, YOU'LL WALK IN
AND SAY HI TO GEORGE.
OKAY.

09:02.172 --> 09:04.775
GEORGE!
AS IN "CLOONEY?"

09:04.775 --> 09:07.217
AS IN "CURIOUS."

09:07.217 --> 09:10.320
MOM, YOU'LL SAY,
"HI, GEORGE, ISN'T IT
A NICE MORNING?"

09:10.320 --> 09:11.852
OKAY. AND...

09:11.852 --> 09:14.685
HI, GEORGE. ISN'T IT
A NICE MORNING?

09:14.685 --> 09:16.727
CUT!
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

09:16.727 --> 09:18.689
IT'S "HI, GEORGE.
ISN'T IT A NICE MORNING?"

09:18.689 --> 09:21.231
ISN'T THAT WHAT I SAID?
YOU KNOW, JUST SAY,
"HI, GEORGE."

09:21.231 --> 09:22.993
HI, GEORGE.
JUST SAY, "HI."

09:22.993 --> 09:25.095
HI.
JUST WAVE.

09:25.095 --> 09:27.768
DON'T WAVE.

09:27.768 --> 09:31.241
ALL RIGHT, SO THIS IS THE SCENE
RIGHT BEFORE THE BRAIN SWITCH.

09:31.241 --> 09:32.673
YOU'RE STILL JUST A DOG.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.776
THIS IS AWESOME!
I'M GONNA BE A STAR!

09:35.776 --> 09:37.948
OH, I'M GONNA NEED AN AGENT.
A-AND SUNGLASSES.

09:37.948 --> 09:41.652
A-AND A POLITICAL CAUSE
I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND.

09:41.652 --> 09:43.754
YOU'RE GONNA PICK UP
YOUR FAVORITE TOY...

09:43.754 --> 09:45.115
( toy squeaking )
AND SQUEAK IT LIKE CRAZY.

09:45.115 --> 09:46.987
GO ON, GET IT.
ACTION!

09:48.188 --> 09:49.890
CUT, CUT.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.762
THIS IS ALL WRONG,

I'M THE DIRECTOR!

09:56.066 --> 09:58.098

09:59.369 --> 10:02.102
I CAN'T WORK LIKE THIS!

10:02.102 --> 10:04.174
MAN, I LOVE THIS TOY!

10:04.174 --> 10:07.938
HEY-- WHERE'D AVERY GO?

10:07.938 --> 10:11.742
ALL RIGHT, YOU JUST
DISCOVERED THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND
HERE HAS THE BRAIN OF A DOG.

10:11.742 --> 10:14.144
ALL RIGHT?
AND...ACTION!

10:14.144 --> 10:17.948
OH, DARLING. EVEN THOUGH
YOU NOW HAVE THE BRAIN OF A DOG,

10:17.948 --> 10:19.920
I WILL LOVE YOU ALWAYS.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.021
RUFF!
Avery: CUT.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.794
OKAY, TYLER,
SO HERE'S THE THING.

10:23.794 --> 10:27.027
I KNOW YOU'RE REALLY TRYING,
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.129
THIS IS TO HELP YOU
GET INTO THE MINDSET
OF BEING A DOG,

10:29.129 --> 10:30.661
AND PARTLY BECAUSE YOU STUNK.

10:30.661 --> 10:32.733
BAD BOY! BAD BOY!

10:32.733 --> 10:34.765
BAD, BAD BOY!

10:34.765 --> 10:37.668
OKAY, PEOPLE,
WE'RE A COUPLE HOURS
BEHIND SCHEDULE.

10:37.668 --> 10:39.710
TEN MINUTES FOR LUNCH.
OH. GOODNESS.

10:39.710 --> 10:42.713
I CAN EAT FAST,
BUT IT GIVES ME THE HOOCUPS.
YOU MEAN "HICCUPS."

10:42.713 --> 10:45.645
NO, HOOCUPS--
I GO, "HOOC!"

10:47.117 --> 10:50.721
SWEETHEART, WHILE
WE'RE ALL TOGETHER,
WE NEED TO TALK.

10:50.721 --> 10:53.253
FINE, BUT IT'S COMING
OUT OF YOUR EATING TIME.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.726
YEAH, SWEETIE.
STUFF LIKE THAT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

10:55.726 --> 10:58.789
WELL, HON, YOU'RE BEING
A LITTLE BIT HARD ON US.

10:58.789 --> 11:00.831
I MEAN, TELLING MOM
SHE COULDN'T EVEN WAVE RIGHT?

11:00.831 --> 11:03.333
IT WAS JUST
A LITTLE, UH...

11:03.333 --> 11:06.837
MAKING US EAT SO FAST.
HOOC!

11:06.837 --> 11:09.299
MAKING ME STAY IN CHARACTER
DURING LUNCH.

11:09.299 --> 11:11.341
TYLER, GET UP
OFF THE FLOOR.

11:13.774 --> 11:17.147
I'M ONLY PUSHING YOU ALL
TO THIS MAKE A BETTER MOVIE.

11:17.147 --> 11:20.851
YOU'RE THE ONES WHO ARE
LAYING THE BIG STINK BOMBS
ALL OVER THE SET.

11:20.851 --> 11:23.854
WELL, YOU'RE MAKING THIS MOVIE
TO SHOW THAT YOU'RE FUN,

11:23.854 --> 11:26.056
BUT NO ONE HERE
IS HAVING ANY.

11:26.056 --> 11:29.790
AND IF STAN
COULD TALK FOR REAL,
I BET HE'D AGREE.

11:32.692 --> 11:36.727
WELL, IF YOU ALL ARE
HAVING SUCH A HORRIBLE TIME,

11:36.727 --> 11:39.800
MAYBE YOU GUYS
ARE THE ONES WHO DON'T
KNOW HOW TO HAVE ANY FUN.

11:39.800 --> 11:43.734
MAYBE I'LL JUST REPLACE YOU
WITH THE BACKUP FAMILY
I HAVE STANDING BY.

11:43.734 --> 11:46.807
THAT'S WHAT THOSE PEOPLE
ARE DOING IN MY OFFICE!

11:46.807 --> 11:48.278
EXCUSE ME A MINUTE.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.441
( clears throat )

11:51.441 --> 11:54.484
YOU CAN ALL GO NOW.
SORRY FOR WASTING
YOUR TIME.

11:57.187 --> 12:00.490
WHO JAMMED MY SQUARE PEG
INTO MY ROUND HOLE?

12:06.056 --> 12:09.499
YOU ARE NOT SHOOTING
A MOVIE IN OUR HOUSE
WITH ANOTHER FAMILY.

12:09.499 --> 12:12.933
MAYBE IT'S JUST TIME
YOU GO ABOUT THIS
IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

12:12.933 --> 12:16.506
(scoffs) FIRST YOU GUYS
TELL ME THAT I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO HAVE FUN,

12:16.506 --> 12:19.339
AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO MAKE A MOVIE?

12:19.339 --> 12:21.071
NO, WE'RE NOT TELLING YOU
ANY OF THAT.

12:21.071 --> 12:25.175
NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME
ANY OF THAT?

12:25.175 --> 12:28.478
YOU KNOW, MY BIGGEST MISTAKE
WAS LETTING YOU ALL
BE IN MY MOVIE.

12:28.478 --> 12:32.022
SWEETHEART, YOU CAN'T
EXACTLY MAKE A MOVIE
BY YOURSELF.

12:32.022 --> 12:34.354
OH YEAH? WATCH ME.

12:36.326 --> 12:37.828
HOOC!

12:37.828 --> 12:39.059

12:53.173 --> 12:55.405
(Spanish accent)
AY, TYLER, YOU ARE BACK,

12:55.405 --> 12:58.448
AND PEOPLE WILL
GET TO KNOW THE REAL YOU
AND SEE HOW FUN YOU ARE!

13:01.381 --> 13:03.413
YEAH, MAN.

13:03.413 --> 13:07.287
IT WAS SO FREAKY
HAVIN' THE BRAINS OF A DOG.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.019
ARF! ARF! ARF! ARF!

13:09.019 --> 13:10.360
ARF! ARF! ARF!

13:10.360 --> 13:13.393
THAT IS OFFENSIVE
ON SO MANY LEVELS.

13:15.225 --> 13:18.068
SO WAS YOU TAKING
EVERYBODY ELSE'S SIDE
AGAINST ME.

13:18.068 --> 13:20.070
AVERY, AS MUCH AS I LOVE YOU,

13:20.070 --> 13:22.873
THE REST OF THE FAMILY
IS NOT THE PROBLEM; YOU ARE.

13:22.873 --> 13:24.304
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

13:24.304 --> 13:27.237
THEY'RE THE ONES
WHO AREN'T LISTENING
TO EVERYTHING I SAY

13:27.237 --> 13:29.539
AND DOING EVERYTHING
EXACTLY HOW I WANT IT!

13:29.539 --> 13:32.042
AND NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES
I SCREAM AT THEM--

13:32.042 --> 13:35.385
OH, MY GOSH,
I AM THE PROBLEM.

13:35.385 --> 13:38.889
(whimpers)
THEY'RE RIGHT ABOUT ME.

13:38.889 --> 13:41.391
HOW CAN I MAKE A FUN MOVIE
WHEN I'M NOT EVEN
A FUN PERSON?

13:41.391 --> 13:43.423
BUT YOU CAN BE A FUN PERSON!

13:43.423 --> 13:45.495
JUST GO A LITTLE CRAZY
ONCE IN A WHILE,

13:45.495 --> 13:47.327
DO SOMETHING WACKY.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.099
I DON'T KNOW.

13:49.099 --> 13:52.262
BUT THANKS, STAN.
YOU'RE THE BEST.

13:52.262 --> 13:54.404
I OWE YOU
A BACON-WRAPPED CAT.

13:54.404 --> 13:56.566
JUST MAKE SURE
IT'S FREE-RANGE.

13:56.566 --> 13:58.608
I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE
MY CELEBRITY CAUSE--

13:58.608 --> 14:01.141
FREE-RANGE
BACON-WRAPPED CATS.

14:04.044 --> 14:07.377
THANK YOU ALL
FOR AGREEING TO
TRY THIS ONE MORE TIME.

14:07.377 --> 14:11.521
I'M SORRY. BEFORE,
I WAS A LITTLE
"GRR! SSS! ACHH!"

14:11.521 --> 14:16.186
NOW I'M GONNA BE
A LITTLE MORE...
"WHOO! HAH HAH! (pop)."

14:16.186 --> 14:20.290
THANK YOU, SWEETIE.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A REALLY GOOD IDEA.

14:20.290 --> 14:21.861
CHLOE, WHERE
HAVE YOU BEEN?

14:21.861 --> 14:25.495
FUNNY STORY. I ACCIDENTALLY
LEFT WITH THAT OTHER FAMILY.

14:25.495 --> 14:28.868
SO, WHERE ARE WE
GOING FOR LUNCH?

14:28.868 --> 14:32.172
HEY, ARE YOU
WEARING MY PANTS?

14:35.275 --> 14:39.609
DID YOU KNOW THERE'S
A GREAT BURGER PLACE NEAR HERE
THAT WE'VE NEVER TRIED?

14:41.511 --> 14:44.114
ALL RIGHT. SO IN THIS SCENE,

14:44.114 --> 14:46.216
MOM AND DAD ARE
GONNA BE HAVING DINNER.

14:46.216 --> 14:49.089
COULD WE DO ACCENTS?

14:49.089 --> 14:51.221

14:56.967 --> 14:59.099
YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHIN' YET.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.371
AND I JUST SAID "AIN'T"!

15:02.302 --> 15:04.134
(British accent)
WELL, HERE WE ARE,

15:04.134 --> 15:07.077
HAVING DINNER WITH OUR SON
WHO HAS SWITCHED BRAINS
WITH A DOG,

15:07.077 --> 15:10.310
AND HIS GIRLFRIEND,
WHO'S MAKING THE MOST
OF A BAD SITUATION--

15:10.310 --> 15:13.413

DOG BRAIN SWITCHEROO.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.286

FOND OF SAYING,

15:16.286 --> 15:18.348
STIFF UPPER LIP,
PASS THE CRUMPETS,

15:18.348 --> 15:20.350
AND SOCCER IS FOOTBALL.

15:20.350 --> 15:23.453
AHA. ANYWAY,
SHAME ABOUT THE BOY.

15:25.255 --> 15:27.357

IT IS SO SAD
WHAT HAPPENED.

I CANNOT IMAGINE HOW FRIGHTENED
AND CONFUSED HE MUST BE.

15:34.304 --> 15:37.437

NIKKI, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S JUST A MOVIE.

SHH! I'M ACTING!

SHE'S GOOD.

15:41.311 --> 15:44.944
FOR SOMEONE
WHO'S NOT DOING AN ACCENT.

15:44.944 --> 15:49.019
SHALL WE RING FOR DESSERT IN
HONOR OF THIS SPECIAL OCCASION?

15:49.019 --> 15:51.681

CALL FOR DESSERT?

15:51.681 --> 15:54.054
OH, LOOK, A HORN!

DON'T YOU JUST HATE IT
WHEN MOVIES CHANGE TONE
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE LIKE THIS?

16:21.981 --> 16:23.653
I HATE THIS.

16:23.653 --> 16:25.685
CAN YOU GUYS JUST
GIVE US A MOMENT?

16:25.685 --> 16:30.160
OKAY, BUT I WASN'T ROLLING.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
DO THAT AGAIN.

HONEY. WHAT HAPPENED, AVERY?

16:34.624 --> 16:36.666
THAT STARTED OUT
SO MUCH FUN!

16:36.666 --> 16:39.729
NOT FOR ME.
IT WENT FULL GALLAGHER.

16:39.729 --> 16:44.404
OH, THAT'S WHO THAT IS.
I WAS TRYING TO THINK
OF THAT GUY'S NAME.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.005
I KNEW THIS WAS A MISTAKE.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.737
WELL, THEN SWEETHEART,
WHY'D YOU DO IT?

16:47.737 --> 16:50.480
BECAUSE EVERYONE
WAS TELLING ME THERE WAS
SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME,

16:50.480 --> 16:52.382
INCLUDING YOU TWO.

16:52.382 --> 16:55.385
NO, NO! WE NEVER SAID
THERE WAS ANYTHING
WRONG WITH YOU,

16:55.385 --> 16:57.317
WE JUST WANTED YOU
TO HAVE FUN!

16:57.317 --> 16:59.319

AND I WAS HAVING FUN.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.121
MY SCHEDULES AND NOTES
AND LISTS

EXACTLY HOW EVERYTHING
HAS TO BE DONE--

17:03.323 --> 17:04.394
THAT'S FUN FOR ME.

17:04.394 --> 17:08.728
YEAH. I'M SORRY.
I THINK WE FORGOT THAT.

17:08.728 --> 17:12.462
IT WAS JUST LIKE EVERYONE
WAS DISAPPOINTED IN ME
FOR BEING ME.

OH, NO.
I KNOW I'M NOT
THE TYPICAL KID,

17:14.804 --> 17:17.267

THAT WAS GREAT.
