00:23.640 --> 00:26.916
<i>Everybody has two families:
The stable family,</i>

00:26.916 --> 00:28.505
<i>we pretend to have</i>

00:28.560 --> 00:31.200
<i>and then there's the real people
we are related to.</i>

00:31.280 --> 00:35.880
<i>My best friend Kenny says stable
family's makes boring children.</i>

00:37.800 --> 00:41.258
<i>And by stable families, I think
he means the kind where mum,</i>

00:41.284 --> 00:44.625
<i>and dad and kids all living in
the same house all the time.</i>

00:45.680 --> 00:49.640
<i>And by boring,
he means not as cool as we are.</i>

00:55.800 --> 01:01.920
Still and undisputed,
universal master of the jungle gym.

01:02.040 --> 01:04.694
I'm getting too old for the
super sonic death spiral.

01:04.696 --> 01:07.425
Lucy, play is the great educator.

01:07.480 --> 01:09.621
Alright, it's sole
purpose is to prepare

01:09.647 --> 01:11.265
juvenile animals for adulthood.

01:11.320 --> 01:14.160
It's not play if you puked
your guts out.

01:16.280 --> 01:18.600
Hey, when you say's your
dad was going to be home?

01:21.280 --> 01:23.880
I guess I'll see your in a week then.

01:25.080 --> 01:28.800
Hey, I'm not going to ditch you
just 'cause my dad's home.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.672
Lucy. It's fine... just go.

01:30.673 --> 01:32.780
- It's fine... I'm cool here.
- Yeah?

01:32.781 --> 01:35.090
- You go!
- Okay!

01:47.320 --> 01:50.195
<i>Mom says she fell in love
with dad because he was fun</i>

01:50.196 --> 01:53.945
<i>and goofy and everything felt
bigger when he is around.</i>

01:54.040 --> 01:55.920
<i>And he's still that way.</i>

01:56.040 --> 02:00.480
<i>Except since dad's a lumberjack, he's
only home four or five times a year.</i>

02:00.560 --> 02:03.000
<i>When dad's here,
we stopped everything.</i>

02:03.080 --> 02:07.160
<i>Mom stays home, I skips school,
it's like a vacation.</i>

02:07.240 --> 02:09.066
<i>I don't know when
I first started to notice</i>

02:09.067 --> 02:12.265
<i>the argument my parents
weren't having.</i>

02:30.840 --> 02:33.400
Hey, let's go out for breakfast.

02:33.480 --> 02:35.076
I'm not a kid anymore.
I won't help you.

02:35.077 --> 02:37.745
Yeah, you are. And yeah you'll...
Come on!

02:44.800 --> 02:49.360
- We're lucky your dad has a job.
- You always say that.

02:50.120 --> 02:51.788
We're all doing the best we can.

02:51.814 --> 02:54.745
Is lying to dad about your
job doing the best we can?

02:57.200 --> 03:01.480
He's out there working his butt off to
support us. You'll hurt his feelings.

03:01.560 --> 03:06.240
So, should I lie to you about what
I'm doing to protect your feelings?

03:06.320 --> 03:08.103
I'm surprised that you didn't
get warned already

03:08.129 --> 03:12.585
I would. I'd did anything interesting
I would actually lied about.

03:12.640 --> 03:16.120
Don't worry honey, you will!
Just give it time.

03:22.880 --> 03:25.146
<i>Mom pretends she doesn't have
a job when dad's here.</i>

03:25.147 --> 03:29.145
<i>She says it's because dad kind of
old school about family roles.</i>

03:30.760 --> 03:33.617
<i>If you asked me,
it's kind of lame that her</i>

03:33.643 --> 03:36.305
<i>secret identity is
being a tele-marketer.</i>

03:41.840 --> 03:46.520
- Mom? What?
- Straight home.

03:47.520 --> 03:48.784
I don't even have my license yet.

03:48.810 --> 03:51.745
Oh! You're a natural. I mean, think
of all the kids you know with license.

03:51.800 --> 03:55.720
Is there any of them more capable
than you? It'll be fun.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.840
Wait! How are you going to get home?

03:59.920 --> 04:05.160
If I can't find a ride in this
outfits, I deserved to walk.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.238
So you're saying she isn't that great?

04:32.239 --> 04:34.484
No, Scott! I'm saying you
don't have to say it out

04:34.510 --> 04:36.610
loud each random thought
that you have.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.750
I bet you she's really great.
You can always tell

04:38.751 --> 04:41.865
the ones that are gonna
be dirty freaky sluts.

04:42.880 --> 04:46.760
Oh yeah... Juicy Lucy.
Ooh... you like that. Ooh yeah!

04:48.149 --> 04:49.374
- Huh!
- Shit!

04:49.800 --> 04:50.610
Ooh... yeah.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.560
- Sorry.
- You're dead, Kenny.

04:56.640 --> 04:58.727
You're... you're totally dead.

04:58.730 --> 04:59.828
- You're deader than death!
- Hey!

04:59.842 --> 05:01.070
- Hey!
- You're gonna wish you were dead.

05:01.071 --> 05:02.232
I saw your dad leave this morning.

05:02.233 --> 05:04.345
I'll tear your guts out and
feed them to the rats.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.944
I'll ripped your head off and
pissed down the hole.

05:06.950 --> 05:08.992
I'll bet if he didn't manually
decapitated you,

05:08.993 --> 05:11.252
and position your body in just
the right angle,

05:11.254 --> 05:12.555
- I'll bet he still couldn't
- You're gonna wish you were dead.

05:12.556 --> 05:14.719
get a stream of urine going.

05:14.720 --> 05:18.560
- Yuck it up, dead boy.
- Hey Scott, what if I kiss you?

05:19.019 --> 05:22.720
For real! Would you leave Kenny alone?

05:25.680 --> 05:28.680
- Yeah.
- Lucy, what are you doing?

05:30.880 --> 05:33.720
Lucy. Come on, Lucy.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.280
So you promised you won't hurt Kenny?

05:52.160 --> 05:54.200
You're a terrible kisser.

06:00.240 --> 06:04.800
What the hell? Who would want
to deal with you anyway.

06:10.720 --> 06:14.015
I believe you're our
greatest resource,

06:14.041 --> 06:17.185
and so to that end we planned
to invest in you.

06:17.240 --> 06:21.188
I'm happy to introduce to you
one of the top tele-marketing

06:21.214 --> 06:24.305
performing coaches in the state,
Guy Carlsberg.

06:27.640 --> 06:30.440
At the very based of our
life is meaning.

06:31.240 --> 06:33.800
And this meaning provides direction.

06:35.080 --> 06:40.360
All of our actions are driven by
our most basic believes.

06:41.200 --> 06:45.747
It's this base of meaning,
that prevents us from

06:45.748 --> 06:48.225
drifting through an empty
existence at work, at home

06:48.280 --> 06:50.480
and in our relationships...

06:51.280 --> 06:53.520
Really in all aspects of our lives.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.859
I can't believe I almost make it to

07:01.885 --> 07:03.865
sixteen without seriously
kissing anyone.

07:03.920 --> 07:06.600
And then the first one is
Scott Booker.

07:09.480 --> 07:11.645
No memories is malleable.

07:11.671 --> 07:14.585
What has that have to do with Scott
trying to lick the back of my throat?

07:15.400 --> 07:18.405
It means that,
every time you tell a story,

07:18.406 --> 07:22.479
it changes a little bit in
your memories, so...

07:22.480 --> 07:25.304
you could say that I was your
first kiss, and then after awhile,

07:25.330 --> 07:27.905
it would be kind of
like Scott never happens.

07:28.680 --> 07:31.520
Kenny, I still got dirt in my mouth.

07:31.600 --> 07:34.840
Oh yuck, I know. You wouldn't have to
actually kiss me, I'm just saying.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.400
I'm thinking of shaving my head.

07:45.520 --> 07:47.796
Well, you'll probably
look pretty cool.

07:47.822 --> 07:49.585
I don't want to look cool.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.120
You would have to kiss me.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
- What?
- To change the memory thing.

07:59.080 --> 08:01.360
You have to do it!

08:05.320 --> 08:06.880
Okay!

08:25.520 --> 08:27.534
<i>So of course when you start
your soffritto</i>

08:27.535 --> 08:29.077
<i>what's really important
is to remember that</i>

08:29.078 --> 08:32.039
<i>you're only as good as
your pantry ingredients.</i>

08:32.039 --> 08:34.934
<i>Now there's always in my word,
two different kind of olive's oil.</i>

08:34.936 --> 08:38.168
<i>The one that I cook with, keep in
mind that there are both extra virgin.</i>

08:38.193 --> 08:39.563
<i>One that I cook with,</i>

08:39.640 --> 08:44.320
<i>and one that I finished with.
The difference is about 30 bucks.</i>

08:44.400 --> 08:47.201
<i>Then you gotta evaluate your
entire pantry ingredients.</i>

08:47.202 --> 08:49.728
<i>I'm adding a little sea salt.
Sea salt from Triponey.</i>

08:49.729 --> 08:52.966
<i>Now, so I also like to use a
little bit of extra... to finish with.</i>

08:52.969 --> 08:55.560
<i>Now this is...
there are both from a single....</i>

09:00.360 --> 09:02.939
You know the bad gal always
sit in the back of the class.

09:02.965 --> 09:04.745
What, you're calling me bad?

09:08.520 --> 09:11.314
I'm back to boring kids with a
stable families,

09:11.315 --> 09:14.865
don't have the beautiful mom who
goes to work in stripper heels.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.720
Bye, thank you!

09:30.800 --> 09:32.520
Hey!

09:37.080 --> 09:39.480
- Missing your dad?
- Yeah!

09:39.560 --> 09:42.914
<i>So now, we've got our
condiments going.</i>

09:42.915 --> 09:44.489
<i>We've got our noodles in the water...</i>

09:44.490 --> 09:46.321
We had a seminary thingy
at work today.

09:46.322 --> 09:50.759
Turns out I'm drifting through an
empty meaningless existence.

09:50.760 --> 09:53.480
See... I tried to tell you.

09:55.760 --> 09:59.560
- How's the show always on?
- I record it.

10:04.800 --> 10:09.680
I've kissed two boys today.
So I probably ruined my whole life.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.840
- With the tongue?
- What?

10:14.920 --> 10:16.920
No, it's gross!

10:18.840 --> 10:22.320
Well, then you're probably
not ruined quite yet.

10:37.120 --> 10:41.000
- Do you want to go down to the river?
- We could.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.640
Could if you want.

10:48.040 --> 10:50.400
It's not like we did anything wrong.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.168
Yeah! I know.

10:52.194 --> 10:55.265
Okay! So don't say stuff like
we could if we want.

10:55.320 --> 10:58.720
What kind of way is that
to talk to me.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.360
Holy shit!

11:10.750 --> 11:11.442
Okay...

11:12.920 --> 11:15.640
This one I'm gonna remember.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.360
Kenny?

12:06.560 --> 12:09.240
I think I've just given him a seizure.

12:09.320 --> 12:12.080
<i>Okay, so now the calamari is
perfectly tender...</i>

12:15.480 --> 12:19.120
Kenny... are you epileptic?

12:23.080 --> 12:26.318
Chicken Caesar... yeah. You're
gonna have to dress it yourself.

12:26.344 --> 12:29.345
If I dressed it now, the leaves
will turn all soggy by lunch time.

12:29.400 --> 12:32.240
I expect you to cultivate a deeper
basic meaning in your own life.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.840
Okay, you're using actual
english words that I recognised

12:34.866 --> 12:37.385
but I've no idea what you're saying.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.809
I don't want you to end up like me.

12:39.835 --> 12:43.585
Mom, that has always been
one of my life ambitions.

12:44.640 --> 12:45.982
Okay! Good girl.

12:45.983 --> 12:48.359
- I love you.
- Go!

12:48.360 --> 12:50.240
I'll see you later.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.815
Hello Miss Burgenham.
My name is Lainee

12:55.841 --> 12:57.865
calling on behalf of
Premier Interworks.

12:57.920 --> 13:03.800
Goddamn it. I'm on the federal no-call
list. Get a new job, you loser.

13:05.760 --> 13:07.840
Alright, let me hear what
you guys got.

13:16.120 --> 13:18.929
<i>They're restructuring our
work schedule...</i>

13:18.955 --> 13:21.625
<i>- ... because of the nature...</i>
- Overtime on a Sunday?

13:21.680 --> 13:25.400
<i>- I won't be late, I promised.</i>
- Mom, I made a pork and lamb ragu!

13:25.480 --> 13:27.399
<i>- More people are home on weekend.</i>
- Yeah, okay.

13:27.400 --> 13:30.759
<i>You know it made more sense to call.
I'm really, really sorry, Lucy.</i>

13:30.760 --> 13:33.019
- Yeah, me too.
<i>- Okay, bye!</i>

13:33.020 --> 13:33.712
Okay!

13:37.880 --> 13:40.920
Hey, want to stay for dinner?

13:42.440 --> 13:45.840
- I can't.
- Please?

13:47.040 --> 13:48.667
You know, my mom don't
just like to eat alone.

13:48.668 --> 13:50.785
Go invite her over!

13:54.000 --> 13:56.080
Why? Are you ashamed of
me or something?

13:59.760 --> 14:02.360
I'll give you some sauce to take home.

14:17.920 --> 14:20.080
I wish my dad were here.

14:23.200 --> 14:26.848
You know how I say about dreaming big?

14:26.874 --> 14:27.785
Yeah?

14:29.280 --> 14:34.080
Well, my bigger life... I get to eat
dinner with you every single night.

14:36.680 --> 14:39.520
I'm gonna cook you the most
amazing meals.

14:59.120 --> 15:03.025
<i>So, the pen-ay is just about 30 seconds
left to being perfectly cooked.</i>

15:03.051 --> 15:05.745
<i>What you want to do at
that point is take it out.</i>

15:05.800 --> 15:10.680
<i>Maybe if I found dad a job here,
we could be a real family.</i>

15:10.760 --> 15:15.040
<i>Mom would have to quit working.
Everything would be perfect.</i>

15:28.280 --> 15:34.560
I lost my parents at 16.
And there is my boyfriend, Ron.

15:34.640 --> 15:38.120
And Chuck.... I mean my husband.

15:38.760 --> 15:41.320
And I had Lucy at seventeen.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.040
I was pretty much a total mess.

15:47.240 --> 15:49.995
You probably hear this all
the time but

15:50.021 --> 15:53.585
you beat me,
see myself on this floor.

15:56.760 --> 15:59.520
It's so much lost at such a early age.

16:02.120 --> 16:05.200
A lonely heart heal at their own pace.

16:43.080 --> 16:44.721
Is this something I'm gonna
need to lie about?

16:44.747 --> 16:46.865
Lucy, what're you doing?

16:46.920 --> 16:49.739
What am I doing? It is 5 am.

16:49.765 --> 16:51.745
I'm sorry, Lucy. I should have call.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.166
I fell asleep at my desk.

16:54.192 --> 16:56.865
And where were you
calling, Uzbekistan?

16:56.920 --> 16:59.339
I just came home to shower,
and changed clothes

16:59.365 --> 17:01.505
and straight back to work and start
the whole thing all over again.

17:01.560 --> 17:04.720
And that's the best you can do?
I fell asleep at my desk.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.859
You know what...
it's been a long night.

17:06.886 --> 17:09.345
Yeah! It's been a long night here too.

17:22.599 --> 17:23.520
Nice clogs.

17:23.546 --> 17:27.224
Nice transsexual
beauty queen costumes.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.851
- You know school back's today.
- I knew about it.

17:30.877 --> 17:31.720
I was just checking.

17:31.721 --> 17:33.479
I didn't know how
much you've forgotten

17:33.480 --> 17:35.050
about your alleged family life.

17:37.440 --> 17:40.800
Well, have a great day, honey... okay!
I'll be back home early tonight.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.440
Are you going need to be
congratulate for that?

17:54.680 --> 17:59.340
Alright, just remember...
no sexual energy. Okay... I mean...

17:59.341 --> 18:01.752
if these people even sense we're
going out, we'd be pretty shit!

18:01.778 --> 18:02.825
We are going out?

18:04.880 --> 18:06.664
I don't... I means... I don't know...
I mean like...

18:06.665 --> 18:09.345
What? Because of all the massive
spring break weekends with you.

18:09.400 --> 18:14.520
- Yeah, because of that!
- It was 100 percent platonic.

18:15.520 --> 18:20.055
Just become invisible. Tried to keep
your animal desires under wraps.

18:20.580 --> 18:22.920
Ooh... it'll be a tremendous struggle.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.485
We were just this trained poodles
jumping through hoops.

18:29.511 --> 18:31.677
High school is not intended to
challenge our intellect.

18:31.703 --> 18:34.210
It doesn't even prepared us
for anything real in life.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.965
I mean what?  After 4 years of
poodle training we graduate,

18:37.966 --> 18:39.355
and if we're really lucky

18:39.356 --> 18:42.284
ours parents get to spend thousands
of dollars of 4 more years

18:42.285 --> 18:43.937
- of higher education...
- Hey... what's up, Lucy.

18:44.684 --> 18:45.745
Hi!

18:45.800 --> 18:47.755
Where have you been?
I never see you out or anything.

18:47.756 --> 18:50.025
There's a party after
the game on Friday.

18:50.080 --> 18:51.430
I don't go to parties.

18:52.336 --> 18:54.585
You should definitely
start going to parties.

18:54.640 --> 18:57.800
I'll text you the address.
See you there.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.953
How can you go off
about poodle theory,

19:03.954 --> 19:06.305
when you were just straight A 4.0.

19:06.360 --> 19:08.315
How does Justin Haven
have your cell number?

19:08.341 --> 19:10.145
I don't know.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.480
I don't even know he knows my name.

19:12.560 --> 19:13.518
I don't get a 4.0

19:13.519 --> 19:16.705
- if I'm always be in something.
- Why?

19:16.760 --> 19:20.800
- I need the power.
- That's very gangster of you.

19:20.880 --> 19:23.991
We're doom.
You're too beautiful to be invisible.

19:24.017 --> 19:25.385
Please don't say that!

19:25.440 --> 19:27.508
Beautiful people are
shallow and self-absorbed.

19:27.509 --> 19:30.785
And come on... they never grow up.

19:31.520 --> 19:33.440
Aah geez... Kenny!

19:44.720 --> 19:49.200
- So you're looking for a job?
- Maybe.

19:49.760 --> 19:52.920
Don't you think you've a shot at
General Contractor?

19:54.320 --> 19:56.480
Just taking a look at what's
out there.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.720
- How was school?
- The same.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.913
Our seminar thing was
about pride today.

20:09.914 --> 20:12.225
Go figure!

20:12.920 --> 20:16.840
You're gonna take pride in
you know... raising you.

20:16.920 --> 20:18.807
I don't have much
credit that I can take

20:18.808 --> 20:20.523
but I'm really proud of who you are.

20:21.600 --> 20:24.485
What's the deal with hand jobs? How do
you know if you're doing the right...

20:24.486 --> 20:26.505
Lucy, please. I'm sorry, okay!

20:29.320 --> 20:32.188
Went to a party
Friday night with Kenny.

20:32.214 --> 20:34.145
Well, that sounds like fun.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.428
Probably not.

20:36.382 --> 20:39.585
Don't you feel strong
parental avoidance based on one.

21:08.040 --> 21:09.680
This is everything.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.622
You know there are people who
actually lived back on high school

21:13.648 --> 21:15.665
as being the best of their lives.

21:16.640 --> 21:20.400
- I'm fine.
- Hey, I knew you'd come.

21:20.480 --> 21:24.720
- Kenny, right?
- Hey ya, Timmo.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.941
Man, I thought the catcher
was going to cry after

21:27.942 --> 21:30.825
he miffed the tag at me on home plate.
- I know!

21:30.880 --> 21:34.400
- You were amazing.
- I did it all for you.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.280
We drinking here or what?

21:37.240 --> 21:40.400
- Rage!
- Rage?

21:40.480 --> 21:42.040
To rage!

21:48.840 --> 21:51.304
It's like I was saying when
Brad called me,

21:51.330 --> 21:53.865
don't be sneaking off on
the sophomores, man.

21:54.440 --> 21:57.091
To Lucy Diamond. The hottest
bitch on North Central High.

21:57.117 --> 21:59.105
Hey, who you're calling a bitch?

22:04.800 --> 22:07.200
She's adorable.

22:08.880 --> 22:11.160
Make a hole. Vomit express!

22:11.240 --> 22:11.760
- Kenny!
- He's fine.

22:11.786 --> 22:13.865
He's fine. He just needs a little air.

22:13.920 --> 22:16.560
- Hey!
- What?

22:16.586 --> 22:18.385
Hey, you over delusional
sense of confidence.

22:20.320 --> 22:22.240
Kenny!

22:33.040 --> 22:34.640
Okay?

22:38.160 --> 22:39.920
Can you please don't do that?

22:48.320 --> 22:53.160
- I love you, Lucy. I do!
- Ooh Kenny... Kenny!

22:53.240 --> 22:56.320
Kenny! You are not in love.
You're drunk.

22:56.400 --> 23:00.080
Justin said that you're hot and
you love him now.

23:00.160 --> 23:05.840
Justin is a meat-head. He is cute,
but dumb. He doesn't even get sarcasm.

23:05.920 --> 23:09.360
- You know... you think he's cute.
No. I don't think he's cute. Come on!

23:09.440 --> 23:12.765
No, I don't think he's cute.
You are so heavy.

23:12.766 --> 23:15.480
Don't step in that, yeah!

23:24.240 --> 23:25.840
<i> Hello! </ I></i>

23:51.160 --> 23:54.751
Come here! There's my girl.
How're ya...

23:54.777 --> 23:56.811
- Make me a muscle.
- Dad!

23:56.812 --> 24:01.360
No more sign. I wanna be a chef.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.560
All done being daddy's
little lumberjack, huh?

24:05.600 --> 24:09.800
- Welcome home.
- So... What's happened?

24:09.880 --> 24:13.931
So... you left March 12 at
eight fifteen. Mom and I went

24:13.932 --> 24:16.662
to the diner's. She got an omelet,
I had pancakes and they...

24:16.663 --> 24:19.280
- Yeah...okay, then what?
- I drove home!

24:19.360 --> 24:20.798
- You drove home?
- Yeah!

24:20.799 --> 24:21.803
In town?

24:21.804 --> 24:24.290
Well, mom told me to come straight
home, but I did go to the park.

24:24.320 --> 24:25.668
Wait, mom let you drive alone?

24:25.669 --> 24:28.490
Dad, I was... I was just trying
to impress Kenny.

24:28.491 --> 24:30.664
And there was this other guy there
who made me kiss him, so...

24:31.145 --> 24:31.945
What!?

24:32.040 --> 24:33.866
Some bitch-tarded assholian

24:33.892 --> 24:35.425
- made you kiss Kenny?
- No, dad!

24:35.480 --> 24:37.771
Some skanky guy Scott and I had to.

24:37.797 --> 24:40.019
He was going to beat up
Kenny if I didn't...

24:40.020 --> 24:42.156
- Scott! Scott who?
- Dad, it was nothing.

24:42.157 --> 24:44.090
It was just stupid
playground stuff and he...

24:44.091 --> 24:46.090
Alright... okay! Where was
the person formerly known as

24:46.116 --> 24:48.185
your mother when all this kissing
and driving was going on?

24:48.240 --> 24:49.149
Dad! She was going to be late so

24:49.150 --> 24:50.813
- I had to drop her off...
- Late? Late for what?

24:50.815 --> 24:53.260
- Good morning.
- Lainee... what the

24:53.286 --> 24:54.419
hell is going on?

24:58.040 --> 25:02.205
I don't know what I was
thinking, Chuck.

25:02.208 --> 25:04.625
- I just...
- Mom, I told him about the job.

25:07.760 --> 25:09.520
A job?

25:13.720 --> 25:15.515
<i>What do I need... Do you want
me to send more money?</i>

25:15.516 --> 25:17.511
<i>Are you having trouble
paying the bills?</i>

25:17.512 --> 25:19.810
<i>It's something to do, Chuck!</i>

25:19.840 --> 25:22.579
<i>It's get really lonely.
What exactly do you</i>

25:22.580 --> 25:24.025
<i>think I should be doing
when you're gone?</i>

25:24.080 --> 25:25.485
<i>Pay attention to raising
your daughter.</i>

25:25.486 --> 25:29.665
<i>I have been raising our daughter
by myself for 16 years.</i>

25:56.640 --> 25:58.360
Kenny?

26:01.520 --> 26:04.800
- Lucy.
- I'm freezing. Move over.

27:55.600 --> 27:58.680
Sorry. I'm sorry.

28:04.120 --> 28:05.840
Lucy!

28:06.600 --> 28:11.400
- You know I love you, don't you?
- That was sex, Kenny. Not love.

28:12.120 --> 28:15.480
- Lucy, I'm serious.
- I gotta go!

28:18.080 --> 28:22.200
Hello? Lucy?

28:24.560 --> 28:26.120
<i>Kenny?</i>

29:30.680 --> 29:33.320
<b>PLANNED PARENTHOOD</b>

29:47.320 --> 29:50.280
<i> Lucy! You have got company.</i>

29:55.440 --> 29:58.512
There was a really bad famine
in the 3rd century.

29:58.538 --> 30:02.665
These butcher, lured 3 little boys
into their shop,

30:02.720 --> 30:06.280
murder them,
soaked them in a barrel of brim.

30:06.360 --> 30:09.096
- It must have been a huge barrel.
- Why, chopped them up!

30:09.122 --> 30:11.265
He's been selling them as ham.

30:11.320 --> 30:15.160
Then Saint Nicholas,
brought the little boys back to life.

30:15.240 --> 30:17.680
Saint Nicholas like Santa Claus,
Saint Nicholas?

30:17.681 --> 30:19.665
Yeah, a lot of people don't
know that about.

30:19.720 --> 30:25.000
I didn't. So what, they were like
little boy zombies or something?

30:25.080 --> 30:27.003
Well, you really didn't believe
in Santa Elves, did you?

30:29.290 --> 30:31.345
- No... no, you gotta...
- I guess not, yeah.

30:31.400 --> 30:33.800
- Hi.
- Hey.

30:34.440 --> 30:36.363
Hey, I thought we should
get a head start on our homework

30:36.389 --> 30:38.585
so it's not hanging
over our head all weekends.

30:38.640 --> 30:44.440
- Yeah. There's cookies inside.
- Yeah.

30:56.160 --> 30:59.261
So, there's a pill you can take
to keep from getting pregnant.

30:59.262 --> 31:03.945
It's a emergency contraception plan B
pill. I got it at Planned Parenthood.

31:04.040 --> 31:05.800
You went there?

31:07.160 --> 31:09.001
So even in the spirit of Easter,

31:09.002 --> 31:11.609
you're saying bringing
people back from the dead

31:11.635 --> 31:13.850
is not such a good thing.

31:13.880 --> 31:17.044
Well, I mean if it's a
full on miracle with no

31:17.045 --> 31:19.467
side effects like brain's damage,
or motor control,

31:19.468 --> 31:21.051
then yeah... it's a good thing but

31:21.052 --> 31:23.835
I think the grey area
of moralistically

31:23.836 --> 31:26.065
is in the quality of life
after resuscitation.

31:26.120 --> 31:28.717
Sure! I get to smell like pickles.

31:28.718 --> 31:31.025
Right! See.... that's no good,
you know.

31:32.160 --> 31:34.360
- I got that!
- Homework.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.677
- Hello!
<i>- Chuck, this is Libby.</i>

31:37.678 --> 31:39.750
<i>Oh... hey, how're you doing?</i>

31:44.400 --> 31:48.299
It's best to take the pill
before 72 hours from this morning.

31:48.300 --> 31:49.638
I already took it.

31:50.840 --> 31:52.282
I'll tell what.
I've got a better idea.

31:52.289 --> 31:54.253
Why don't you guys come
over here for brunch.

31:57.320 --> 31:58.692
Yeah, Lucy always made
some mountain of food.

31:58.718 --> 32:00.459
They're like brother and
sister already, so...

32:00.460 --> 32:02.905
- you know, we're already like family.
<i>- Okay!</i>

32:03.000 --> 32:04.805
- 11 o'clock on Sunday?
<i>- Alright.</i>

32:04.806 --> 32:07.281
Fantastic! Alright, I'll see you then.

32:08.720 --> 32:12.720
We're gonna have Easter brunch on
Sunday together. How great is that?

32:19.080 --> 32:21.049
Did you know that I used to
babysit your mom?

32:21.075 --> 32:22.305
Of course she does.

32:22.360 --> 32:23.786
Remember I told you
about the babysitter

32:23.787 --> 32:27.505
- who puked in our Jack janitor?
- Ooh, I forgot all that!

32:29.480 --> 32:31.480
- And what you did... didn't you...
- What?

32:31.481 --> 32:33.918
give Lainee's cousin the
teething to wear

32:33.919 --> 32:36.585
that you found in her mother
underwear's drawer?

32:36.640 --> 32:39.636
I was 14. I had no idea
why the women were

32:39.662 --> 32:42.465
so upset and the men couldn't
stopped laughing.

32:43.840 --> 32:45.143
It was a vibrator.

32:45.169 --> 32:48.425
Yeah, I got there on my own.
Thank you.

32:52.520 --> 32:55.798
So then Lucy, winds up
having to kiss this

32:55.824 --> 32:59.025
shitdiculous kid Scott
something, Scott...

32:59.080 --> 33:00.129
Booker.

33:00.130 --> 33:00.930
Scott Booker.

33:00.956 --> 33:03.890
Scott Booker. Scott mix smell ass
Booker. Yes!

33:03.920 --> 33:07.273
Apparently to save Kenny
from getting a beating.

33:07.299 --> 33:09.905
See, that's completely unfair.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.676
Hey, let's do that thing where
we all go round

33:12.677 --> 33:13.698
and say what we're thankful for.

33:13.699 --> 33:15.159
- All I'm saying what's unfair?
- At Thanksgiving...

33:15.160 --> 33:18.149
Teenage boys have feelings too.
Did it occurred to you that

33:18.175 --> 33:21.025
Scott or Kenny might have been
embarrassed or upset by what happened?

33:21.080 --> 33:24.040
I'll start... I am thankful
to live in a country...

33:24.120 --> 33:27.840
I can tell you all about teenage boys
and their penis-centric feeling.

33:27.920 --> 33:28.997
... nonfiction novel and

33:29.023 --> 33:30.177
- reality television.
- Ooh, that's such a

33:30.178 --> 33:32.344
stupid over generalization.

33:32.345 --> 33:34.720
I am thankful for the multi
Italiano cookbook which I got...

33:34.800 --> 33:37.105
It's just as hard to be
a teenage boy as it is

33:37.131 --> 33:39.385
to be a teenage girl.
Isn't that right, Kenny?

33:39.440 --> 33:43.230
As a former pregnant teenager,
I'd say it's way tougher being a girl.

33:43.231 --> 33:46.103
Lenny, I know you were
lost in your grief

33:46.104 --> 33:48.385
and your anger when your parents died.

33:48.440 --> 33:51.655
And... and even Chuck dropped
out of High school.

33:51.656 --> 33:54.021
Everyone said he'd a chance
of playing college ball.

33:54.400 --> 33:58.280
I don't want Kenny to have to give up
his life like Chuck did.

33:58.360 --> 34:03.440
Kenny has just as much at risk in a
sexual relationship as Lucy does.

34:06.040 --> 34:07.840
What the F...ing shit?

34:07.920 --> 34:11.326
I think the issue isn't so much
who has a more difficult time,

34:11.327 --> 34:12.917
I think it's challenging for
all of us...

34:12.918 --> 34:14.320
- Maybe you didn't know?
- No, I don't.

34:14.400 --> 34:17.034
I don't need you to tell me what
you think my daughter is doing...

34:17.034 --> 34:18.185
Nothing is being taught...

34:18.280 --> 34:19.623
And I don't have to
standby and pretend

34:19.650 --> 34:21.330
that there's nothing I can
do about it.

34:21.331 --> 34:23.824
The real issue is how do we
hold society more accountable?

34:23.880 --> 34:25.560
That's enough!

34:29.080 --> 34:34.440
Are you making accusing against
our daughter? How dare you?

34:35.760 --> 34:39.639
And I didn't give up my life.
My family is my life.

34:46.800 --> 34:49.750
You know in the eastern religions
they... they believe that our entire

34:49.751 --> 34:52.945
life's were just an illusion and
none of this is actually real.

34:54.400 --> 34:57.280
The Buddhists call it <i>samsara.</i>

34:57.360 --> 35:00.240
Hey... hey!

35:01.360 --> 35:02.880
Who's a good boy?

35:07.000 --> 35:11.760
- What a <i>samsara</i> Easter.
- You know I didn't tell her anything.

35:12.560 --> 35:14.200
I know.

35:15.280 --> 35:19.360
Our parents are never to be
within 500 yards of each other.

35:19.440 --> 35:22.360
That's absolutely imperatives.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.761
I don't want to have sex again.

35:29.272 --> 35:30.913
It's not because of your mom
and my dad's.

35:32.600 --> 35:36.440
I just want to wait till we're older.
- Okay.

35:40.080 --> 35:43.200
That's it? Okay?

35:43.280 --> 35:44.800
Hello, <i>Chica.</i>

35:47.200 --> 35:50.120
Do you know how long we've
been doing this?

35:51.200 --> 35:54.920
Easter leftovers feast for the dogs?
Since we were 8.

35:55.040 --> 35:58.480
Right and we have been friends
since we were six.

35:58.560 --> 36:02.880
That's 10 years, Lucy. You know, most
marriages don't even last that long.

36:03.720 --> 36:05.880
I just want us to last.

36:12.560 --> 36:16.240
I thought guy's was supposed to have
a sexual thought every 30 seconds?

36:17.520 --> 36:20.560
I didn't say I wouldn't
think about it.

36:24.040 --> 36:29.400
- Hey! No alcohol.
- Agreed, but...

36:29.480 --> 36:32.777
You realised this make us
like totally abnormal, right?

36:32.803 --> 36:34.745
We could always take up smoking.

36:35.560 --> 36:40.360
Yeah, or latexbondage.
I hear that's fun.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.400
Scott?

36:57.080 --> 36:59.840
Hey, Lucy. Look what I went and found.

37:02.920 --> 37:04.520
Here you go.

37:05.880 --> 37:07.600
Scott.

37:09.800 --> 37:12.680
I was raised in
Saint Bartholomew orphanage.

37:12.760 --> 37:15.437
And while I realised that
was a pretty strict

37:15.463 --> 37:18.345
upbringing and a different time...

37:19.640 --> 37:22.491
We didn't force girl's to do
things back then.

37:24.106 --> 37:24.519
Yes, sir!

37:24.560 --> 37:26.640
Dad, it wasn't even his idea.

37:28.440 --> 37:28.924
Do you know what happened

37:28.925 --> 37:32.225
- to Saint Bartholomew?
- No, sir!

37:34.840 --> 37:38.120
They took a knife and they
skinned his feet.

37:40.160 --> 37:43.167
And he's alive. He's watching this
happened. Now, they just want

37:43.168 --> 37:45.625
1 big piece of skin. So, you know...

37:46.480 --> 37:51.560
They're taking their time.
One long slice at the leg...

37:52.880 --> 37:58.080
and they carefully peeled the skin
away from the muscle.

37:59.400 --> 38:02.507
Now, most people die when they reached
the mid-section but Bartholomew,

38:02.533 --> 38:04.785
is one of the apostles.

38:06.280 --> 38:09.280
He's still alive, even after they
skinned his face off his skull.

38:09.360 --> 38:12.400
Dad... come on! There is no really...

38:12.480 --> 38:16.480
Your apology should be so sincere,
that it breaks my heart.

38:17.400 --> 38:19.080
I'm sorry.

38:24.280 --> 38:29.480
I'm sorry, Lucy. I really didn't
mean it. I really am sorry.

38:32.280 --> 38:35.280
Real men treat women with respect.

38:36.160 --> 38:40.080
- Say it.
- Real men treat women with respect.

38:43.360 --> 38:45.440
Have a good Easter, Scott.

38:48.880 --> 38:50.640
Scott, I'm so...

38:56.400 --> 38:58.220
- Scott was scared to dead.
I just need him to apologizes to Lucy.

38:58.246 --> 38:59.468
- Well, you'll be lucky if his family
- Seeing he's out driving around...

38:59.494 --> 39:00.890
doesn't pressed charges.

39:00.920 --> 39:03.694
Oh please! You've your job now, right?

39:03.695 --> 39:05.585
So somebody had to make
time for parenting.

39:05.640 --> 39:07.520
You call that parenting?

39:07.600 --> 39:09.784
What... I'm not enough
to get jealous about anymore,

39:09.810 --> 39:11.745
you have to throw Lucy in too?

39:13.000 --> 39:15.864
Anything I need to be jealous about?
Who should I be jealous about?

39:15.865 --> 39:19.225
Go cool off before you do
something really stupid.

39:30.160 --> 39:32.600
Mom, are you okay?

39:34.000 --> 39:35.760
Yeah, I'll be.

39:39.080 --> 39:40.164
- Hello?
<i>- How's the hottest bitch</i>

39:40.165 --> 39:43.705
<i>- of North Central High.</i>
- Would you stop calling me that.

39:43.760 --> 39:47.400
- Boy troubles?
- This jerk won't leave me alone.

39:47.480 --> 39:50.080
Get used to it.

39:54.760 --> 39:58.511
Hey sweetie. I just called work,
they're short a couple of guys.

39:58.946 --> 40:00.362
Can't even give this guy
some privacy.

40:00.388 --> 40:01.690
Same old... same old.

40:07.240 --> 40:08.347
What... you're leaving?

40:08.373 --> 40:10.745
Yes, I just called work. They're short
of a couple of guys. I gotta go.

40:13.160 --> 40:17.520
<i>Jesus... Chuck, you're lying.
You're lying right in my face.</i>

40:19.120 --> 40:21.898
<i>Now I am the liar? I'm the one
that keeps us going, lady.</i>

40:21.924 --> 40:24.745
<i>You think you make enough with your
little job to pay for all this?</i>

40:26.880 --> 40:30.320
<i>I'm leaving because I've to work.
Somebody have to work...</i>

40:34.120 --> 40:37.840
<i>You know what? Go, just go then.
Run away...</i>

41:01.320 --> 41:04.720
How is the hottest bitch of
North Central High?

41:44.000 --> 41:47.560
<i>Building self-esteem is one thing,
but maintaining a high level esteem</i>

41:47.640 --> 41:49.780
<i>required you incorporate 629</i>

41:49.806 --> 41:51.945
<i>into your life and make
them a habit for you.</i>

41:52.040 --> 41:53.880
What a piece of shit!

42:00.640 --> 42:02.280
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.965
<i>So you want to add a
little bit herbal and...</i>

42:11.991 --> 42:14.140
<i>a little fresh paisley,
a little bit...</i>

42:14.141 --> 42:17.360
<i>Kenny says we hit rock bottom
with the Easter freak feast.</i>

42:17.440 --> 42:21.280
<i>I always picture rock bottom with way
more hard drugs and bad cooking.</i>

42:21.360 --> 42:24.197
<i>So when these last 30 seconds is
when everything really great,</i>

42:24.223 --> 42:26.905
<i>that can happen can,
but also when it could be a disaster.</i>

42:28.040 --> 42:32.280
<i>And now it gets you in the right spot,
and then you take it to the plate.</i>

42:37.440 --> 42:39.000
Hey!

42:41.120 --> 42:44.360
I got your text. What's going on?

42:44.440 --> 42:47.640
- I'm okay! Just...
- Hey!

42:50.880 --> 42:54.040
You don't actually seem that ok!

42:59.760 --> 43:02.720
Do you remember that morning
I came into your room?

43:05.000 --> 43:10.160
Well, I think we can improve on
that memory.

43:12.360 --> 43:14.876
What about our abstinence promise?

43:14.902 --> 43:16.945
It will be like a do-over.

43:17.040 --> 43:19.240
Do-overs don't count.

43:51.000 --> 43:55.040
- I've to go live with my dad.
- What?

43:56.920 --> 44:00.245
They've changed my parenting plan.

44:00.271 --> 44:03.305
Apparently my dad's really been
working his sobriety.

44:05.080 --> 44:09.240
They can't make you move
clear across the state.

44:09.320 --> 44:12.360
We're minors. They can make
me do anything they want.

44:15.360 --> 44:16.992
We have to wait until the
school years over.

44:16.993 --> 44:21.105
No, Lucy... power corrupts. And
parental power corrupts absolutely.

44:27.400 --> 44:29.360
Is it because of me, because of us?

44:31.680 --> 44:35.000
- Probably.
- My God!

44:37.040 --> 44:40.720
We are stupid.
We have ruined everything.

45:11.640 --> 45:13.360
Hey!

45:14.360 --> 45:16.000
Yo!

45:18.040 --> 45:21.880
- Where's Kenny?
- I don't know.

45:38.040 --> 45:40.280
Hey, you know what happen right there?

45:43.600 --> 45:47.920
You! You have been right there.

45:50.120 --> 45:52.680
That is something I never
needed to know.

45:56.440 --> 45:58.830
Your dad was the only man
I'd sex with until this year.

45:58.831 --> 46:01.705
Mom, I... come on!

46:17.400 --> 46:20.160
Where is Kenny? Where are you?

46:20.240 --> 46:23.024
<i>Text to the masses, cutting classes...</i>

46:23.025 --> 46:25.625
<i>smacking them asses...</i>

46:25.680 --> 46:30.880
Hello shawty! No, look... seriously.
There's a really great party tonight.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.100
Everyone's gonna be there.

46:32.126 --> 46:34.705
It's too bad I hate everyone
or else I'll be there too.

46:34.760 --> 46:36.881
You're weird, you know
but in a super hot way.

46:36.882 --> 46:40.665
You're clueless, you know
but in a dull and obvious way.

46:40.720 --> 46:45.360
I see your future, Lucy Diamond.
You'll lighten up and you'll have fun.

46:48.280 --> 46:50.955
In high school, I thought
I was going to be famous.

46:50.956 --> 46:52.225
Famous for what?

46:52.280 --> 46:55.275
I don't know. I just...
I still think I wasn't going

46:55.301 --> 46:58.145
to end up so, so regular.

46:59.240 --> 47:00.120
Boring.

47:00.146 --> 47:03.665
My parents died in a car crash
when I was in high school, so...

47:04.520 --> 47:08.280
- actually I like kinda stood out.
- Jesus!

47:08.360 --> 47:11.105
And Chuck was an orphan
so I figured he was

47:11.131 --> 47:13.625
the only person who
could understand me.

47:13.680 --> 47:17.560
- He sort of rescued you?
- No, that was Lucy.

47:18.600 --> 47:23.680
She forced me to fight my way
back to regular and boring.

47:23.760 --> 47:27.160
Ooh, there's nothing about you
that's regular and were boring.

47:32.200 --> 47:35.040
<i>He hasn't been in school all week.
He wouldn't just leave.</i>

47:35.120 --> 47:38.520
- He's really not here, Lucy.
<i>- No, I'm coming over there.</i>

47:44.280 --> 47:46.840
Justin said you want to ride
with us to the party.

47:57.720 --> 48:01.360
I got this for you.
Seems like you weren't into beer.

48:06.640 --> 48:09.760
- Saint Judah.
- Huh?

48:10.680 --> 48:12.864
Patron saint of lost causes.
Beaten to death

48:12.890 --> 48:15.025
with a club and beheaded
1st century AD.

48:16.360 --> 48:18.720
Isn't that a Beatles song?

48:29.600 --> 48:32.640
Nice car. Does it go fast?

48:47.240 --> 48:49.545
High school hero can't dance? No!

48:49.571 --> 48:51.545
Are you gonna rapped or are
you gonna dance? Come on!

48:51.600 --> 48:53.760
I could dance. I could dance.

49:03.280 --> 49:07.320
I think your girlfriend is kinda
jealous of us talking.

49:07.400 --> 49:10.240
Jaime? No, me and her
broke-up a long time ago.

49:12.040 --> 49:15.320
You don't think I'm good enough,
so I can't hang out with you guys?

49:15.400 --> 49:17.600
- She's wrong about that.
- Yeah.

49:19.600 --> 49:23.040
- You're drunk.
- I know.

49:23.120 --> 49:25.240
Come on.

49:47.560 --> 49:50.440
Look, everyone staring at us now.

49:50.466 --> 49:52.525
- Let them watch!
- Okay...

49:52.526 --> 49:54.650
Okay, you've got to give them a show.

50:10.280 --> 50:14.360
Come on! I even have
my sweat-shirt on.

50:20.120 --> 50:24.341
Come on... I can't move my arms.
Hey, stop!

50:24.342 --> 50:26.825
Come on, cut it out. That's hurt...
cut it out.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.760
That was awesome!

50:57.320 --> 51:01.520
So the word, consensual
mean anything to you?

51:04.200 --> 51:06.560
What did you think was
going to happen?

51:10.320 --> 51:12.840
I need you... I need you to leave.

51:47.480 --> 51:50.880
- Is everything okay?
Does it actually looks like I'm okay?

52:36.240 --> 52:37.709
Why do you smell like vomit?

52:39.921 --> 52:42.510
How many possible answers can
there be to that question?

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Kenny is gone.

52:53.240 --> 52:58.440
- He didn't even say goodbye.
- Oh Lucy, honey. I'm so sorry.

53:02.160 --> 53:05.640
Someone gave me
peppermint schnapps at the party.

53:05.720 --> 53:08.224
Once I got sick on cinnamon schnapps.

53:09.192 --> 53:12.145
And now I gargle a little every-time
I walked past a Cinnabon.

53:20.080 --> 53:22.560
- Hey Mom...
- Yeah?

53:34.240 --> 53:36.800
I puked inside my shirt.

54:01.080 --> 54:03.420
It's been my experience,
parents usually

54:03.446 --> 54:05.385
know more than you think they do.

54:05.440 --> 54:06.560
My dad's away working.

54:07.854 --> 54:10.065
It might helped both of you
if you let your mother know.

54:10.840 --> 54:12.392
She thinks I'll ended up
just like her.

54:13.265 --> 54:16.905
Evidences I collect today can
be held anonymously for 30 days.

54:17.000 --> 54:20.800
You've that amount of time to decide
if you want to file a police report.

54:21.840 --> 54:26.240
There's a drug Truvada... it would
help prevent you from getting HIV.

54:28.480 --> 54:30.160
Like AIDS... HIV?

54:30.240 --> 54:32.621
It has to be taken for
3 weeks and the side-effects

54:32.647 --> 54:34.865
are intense like a really bad flu.

54:35.840 --> 54:40.280
I'm a sophomore in high school.
I kissed a total of 3 boys.

54:40.360 --> 54:43.440
The medication I would encouraged
you to consider given the situation.

54:53.160 --> 54:57.560
Hey... hey! How are you?
I... I try to call you.

54:58.440 --> 55:00.320
I've been really worried.

55:01.520 --> 55:03.200
Hey Lucy! Wait up.

55:05.160 --> 55:10.080
I'm not Justin. I'm not like him,
Lucy. I didn't do anything.

55:10.160 --> 55:12.739
No, you didn't do anything.
You didn't say anything.

55:12.740 --> 55:14.345
You just let him think it was okay.

55:14.400 --> 55:16.239
Yeah... I don't think he's
going to listen to anything.

55:16.240 --> 55:18.380
Okay... well, congratulations
because you're so much

55:18.406 --> 55:20.450
the better person, it's impressive.

55:26.560 --> 55:29.824
<i>Sorry, I left without saying goodbye.
In my bigger life,</i>

55:29.978 --> 55:33.425
<i>I'm far way more mature than that.
Not such a detestable chicken shit.</i>

55:38.640 --> 55:39.946
How are you feeling?

55:39.972 --> 55:44.345
Like I'm covered in coals and
I wanna puked through my eyes.

55:47.160 --> 55:49.848
I can't believe you've the
flu on your birthday.

55:50.274 --> 55:51.045
Yeah!

55:51.046 --> 55:55.240
- Rotten luck, huh!
- Wanna open dad's first?

56:10.720 --> 56:16.600
Wow, life-time achievement award
for worst present ever.

56:19.200 --> 56:21.120
I think they're adorable.

56:31.080 --> 56:33.600
- Is that from Kenny?
- Yeah.

56:35.440 --> 56:38.200
Oh, these are pretty bottles.

56:41.880 --> 56:43.600
It is olive oil.

56:46.080 --> 56:47.600
Must be good stuff.

56:49.720 --> 56:51.360
It is really, really good.

57:02.760 --> 57:04.655
Something smells great!

57:04.681 --> 57:07.162
Oh... It's just chicken.

57:07.188 --> 57:09.730
I didn't have time to plan it,
make it more elaborate.

57:12.720 --> 57:17.280
Oh, I didn't know you were
fixing anything.

57:17.360 --> 57:20.840
- It's my birthday!
- I'm so sorry. I... I...

57:20.920 --> 57:25.280
I just thought that we would go out
together when you're feeling better.

57:28.880 --> 57:30.656
You know,
I'll sit with you while you eat.

57:30.657 --> 57:33.145
Hey mom! You don't have to.

57:34.480 --> 57:36.300
- No, I'm gonna call and cancel this-
- Mom...

57:36.301 --> 57:37.865
Honestly! That would just
make it worse.

57:40.920 --> 57:42.680
I'm fine.

57:46.520 --> 57:49.356
<i>So with this dish,
I recommend a delicate dry</i>

57:49.382 --> 57:52.305
<i>white wine from the Pouilly
or from the Veneto</i>

57:52.360 --> 57:55.680
<i>My favourite is Pinot Grigio,
riddled in with the greenness</i>

57:55.706 --> 57:59.025
<i>in the hills of the eastern side
of the Fréville mountains.</i>

57:59.080 --> 58:04.640
<i>If I hadn't had sex with Kenny,
if I had been more strict with mom...</i>

58:05.880 --> 58:09.240
<i>If I made it clear to Dad,
that we needed him here.</i>

58:09.320 --> 58:12.500
<i>If I hadn't been such a
stupid drunken dumbass who</i>

58:12.526 --> 58:15.705
<i>didn't even consider something
hideous could happen...</i>

58:16.480 --> 58:20.680
<i>With just a little bit...
of toasted sliced almonds.</i>

58:45.080 --> 58:47.320
<i>Hey, I got your postcard.</i>

58:47.400 --> 58:49.671
<i>Yeah, well, just because
I send you a postcard everyday</i>

58:49.672 --> 58:51.585
<i>doesn't mean I think
about you all the time.</i>

58:51.640 --> 58:56.160
<i>- That would be blatantly pathetic.
- Yeah... yeah, even for me.</i>

58:59.680 --> 59:01.600
<i>I'd this dream where
we were at the Jungle gym.</i>

59:01.601 --> 59:03.594
<i>Wait, I'm confused.
I thought that was real life.</i>

59:03.600 --> 59:04.930
<i>No, no... listen.</i>

59:05.000 --> 59:08.763
<i>In a dream, we start at the Jungle
gym. We walked in opposite</i>

59:08.764 --> 59:11.225
<i>direction until we met on the
other side of the world.</i>

59:11.280 --> 59:12.559
<i>And then I thank you for</i>

59:12.560 --> 59:15.145
<i>- always having my back.
- Yeah...</i>

59:15.200 --> 59:16.920
<i>Shut up!</i>

59:20.200 --> 59:22.619
<i>You know what we should do this
summer? There's an Italian class</i>

59:22.645 --> 59:25.185
<i>at the library and it's free
and we could take it and...</i>

59:25.240 --> 59:26.725
<i>It's just my dad had
already signed me up</i>

59:26.726 --> 59:28.665
<i>for summer class as
it's a college year.</i>

59:28.690 --> 59:29.470
<i>That's stupid.</i>

59:29.471 --> 59:30.860
<i>But there's a week right before</i>

59:30.886 --> 59:32.050
<i>school start again and...</i>

59:32.051 --> 59:35.650
<i>- What before school start?
- Well, it wasn't my idea, okay.</i>

59:35.651 --> 59:37.690
<i>Kenny, you're kidding me?
You're telling me I'm not gonna</i>

59:37.691 --> 59:43.440
<i>- see you all summer. That's crazy!
- Lucy! Lucy... Lucy...</i>

59:46.880 --> 59:48.854
Hey! I...

59:48.855 --> 59:51.979
Okay, I imagined you think you're
being devoted and persistence

59:51.980 --> 59:54.518
- but this is known as stalking.
- Okay, I promised I will

59:54.544 --> 59:55.136
leave you alone.

59:55.162 --> 59:57.530
Oh, so you're stalking me just to
promise to leave me alone this summer.

59:57.560 --> 01:00:00.010
Please just let me
say one thing, okay.

01:00:00.011 --> 01:00:03.229
I've been doing a lot
of thinking lately...

01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:05.431
Oh, that's too late to start thinking.
Just stick to

01:00:05.457 --> 01:00:07.305
mindlessly following
your peer's group.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:13.160
- That peer group thing...
- Yo... incoming!

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:17.319
Artful move there, dude.

01:00:17.345 --> 01:00:18.968
<i>Oh, so it's going
to be like that, huh.</i>

01:00:18.994 --> 01:00:20.819
<i>- Alright!</i>
- I feel like I need to make

01:00:20.845 --> 01:00:22.810
amends for my part in that.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:27.560
Always picking on my rebounds,
huh... Timmy boy.

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:35.720
Damn. Pretty step-up, Tim.

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:38.600
<i>- Justin, you just got ditch!
- Excuse me...</i>

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:43.000
Hey, I'm going fishing. Do you think
you might want to come along?

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:46.360
I've only just stop thinking
of you as an heinous ass-hole.

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.780
Okay, it's just fishing.
It's to celebrate

01:00:48.781 --> 01:00:50.465
the end of the school year. And to

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:55.120
show you I'm not a heinous ass-hole.
It doesn't mean anything.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:59.120
Okay, maybe!

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:07.480
Well, you know when Mario Batali
was our age, he was living in Spain.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.720
I live in a region that's famous
for it's chicken fried steak.

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:14.160
<i>I'm so far behind in my life.</i>

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:19.440
You know I read that women who
have had more than one sexual

01:01:19.466 --> 01:01:22.385
partners are later more contended
<i>in their marriages.</i>

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:27.720
Wow, that's statistically really
romantic of you, Mr. Idle Leftfield.

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:32.066
You know if you ever do decide
to hook up with someone else,

01:01:32.092 --> 01:01:34.545
just don't tell me about it, okay.
I mean... I...

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:39.440
I have a really visual imagination. I
don't need those pictures in my head.

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:40.970
You're telling me,
you want me to lie to you?

01:01:40.971 --> 01:01:45.385
<i>Yes,</i> please lied your ass off.
Just be convincing.

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:52.920
I should warn ya.
I'm an old-fashioned kind of guy.

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:56.655
Like to wear tighty whitties and
listen to Bob Seger and ZZ Top.

01:01:56.656 --> 01:02:00.440
No... I mean, I believe in going slow.

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:04.360
- You mean with sex?
- Yeah.

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:07.362
You know I just think... you know...

01:02:07.388 --> 01:02:10.625
Real intimacy is physical
and emotional, right.

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:15.358
I just... I feel like I need to
really know someone before we can...

01:02:15.359 --> 01:02:16.625
Kiss?

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:19.880
No, kissing would be ok.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.920
Not the full on horizontal <i>Bob</i> ?

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.108
And now you're making fun of me

01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:28.825
- No, no, no, I'm serious.
- No, no... you're making fun of me.

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:32.520
You have no idea how cool
I think that is.

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:35.880
It's cool.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.920
I get all the love songs now, doesn't
used to make sense to me before.

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.360
He's married, isn't he?

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:49.200
Why do you say things like that?

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.840
I hate that you're right all the time.

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:56.560
I'm a complete pessimist so
the odds are always with me.

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:02.760
Why do people stay together?
In bad relationships I mean.

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:08.920
They eat so much shit for so long,

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:12.640
they don't even recognize
the taste of it after a while.

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:18.720
You think I've been eating shit,
don't you?

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:03.600
- Lucy, wait!
- It's okay. I would like to.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.496
Do they have to be oyster mushrooms?

01:04:07.522 --> 01:04:09.905
How do you tell which ones
is the oyster mushrooms?

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.920
Like a lightish-brown,
kind of fan shaped.

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:15.560
Stop.

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:22.840
Wait, I'm gonna ask somebody.

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.160
Never mind, I'll be home
in a little bit.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.760
Shit, shit! Quickly, quickly!

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:40.360
Hey, kiddo!

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:50.280
Quickly put your jeans on!

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:14.560
Hello... hello?

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.520
Anyone here?

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.720
Lucy?

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:41.560
- Hello?
- Bob?

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:44.400
Hey! I'm with the family now.

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:48.687
Is that your estranged wife that you
have your arm around right now?

01:05:48.688 --> 01:05:51.505
<i>The one you can't stand to touch?</i>

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.400
- Please, please, please please...
- Lainee?

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.600
Jeff? Is that... is that you?

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:12.952
Just because we didn't have sex
does not mean you weren't cheating.

01:06:12.978 --> 01:06:16.305
<i>You should know that, you're being</i>
unfaithful to everyone around you.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:18.040
Lainee!

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:22.400
Dad, it's just me.

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:24.880
Lucy...

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.120
I'm coming over there
if you keep this up.

01:06:27.121 --> 01:06:30.345
Look... don't! I'll just...,
let me go to the...

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:34.400
Mr. Diamond... I'm Tim, I'm sorry that
we had to meet this way

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.120
Just one second.

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:45.760
Tim, Tim... will you please stop it!

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.280
Daddy!

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:56.776
- Don't make a scene.
No, you make a scene! This is entirely

01:06:56.802 --> 01:06:59.825
and completely your old-fashioned
guy kind of scene!

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.774
Hey, sweet-sweetie,
look I got you these.

01:07:05.776 --> 01:07:08.745
Why don't you go put that in the...
in the car with Mummy, huh.

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:13.073
We love each other.
We're going to get married.

01:07:13.074 --> 01:07:15.065
No, we do not. We're not... just go!

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:24.480
Daddy... daddy, are you okay?

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:52.120
And Saint Agathe was forced into a
brothel, but no man... could... enter.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:56.280
Those who even dare to touch
her got sick and die.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.840
She was thrown into the
prison and tortured.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.320
Her breasts were crushed
and then cut-off.

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:08.120
She was forced to roll in hot coals.

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:13.360
But through-out it all,
she refused to give up her virginity.

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:24.120
So, I should wanna be
tortured and mutilated

01:08:24.145 --> 01:08:27.904
rather than have sex with
a guy I really liked?

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.988
Is that the moral to the story?

01:08:31.314 --> 01:08:33.104
This is not the person I want
you to be, Lucy.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.738
What do you want me to be?
You want me to be like mom who

01:08:35.764 --> 01:08:38.345
as it happen, you got pregnant
when we were both exactly my age.

01:08:38.399 --> 01:08:42.560
Your mother and I gave up everything.
We got married to have you.

01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:46.040
What? How about if I'm a self-center
immature controlling high school

01:08:46.066 --> 01:08:49.465
drop-out who uses every
excuse not to be with my family?

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:51.680
Is that the person you want me to be?

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:55.439
You're such an awesome
role model, dad.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.783
You know we need to showing up every

01:09:11.786 --> 01:09:13.745
3 months to provide
your moral guidance.

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:17.240
I got it. I got it!

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.720
We could get a restraining order.

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.790
Why? He'll just come back in

01:10:05.791 --> 01:10:07.745
a few months and everything
will be the same.

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:11.560
I don't want that!

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:19.560
- Are you and dad over, then?
- We were over a long, long time ago.

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:27.080
I wish my parents were still alive.

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:29.560
Do you miss them?

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:34.440
Yeah, but I missed them all for you.

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:40.080
- I wish you had them.
- Grandparents would be kind of cool.

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.600
I came from a good family, you know.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:48.160
And any mess I have made of my life,
I'd no one to blame but myself.

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:58.480
There's no one I want to talk to...
Except Kenny and you.

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:10.360
- Hello.
<i>- Lainee, is that you?</i>

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.193
- Ron?
<i>- It's me.</i>

01:11:12.219 --> 01:11:15.185
- Oh, my God!
<i>- I know, right...</i>

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:17.587
<i>- I just thought that I...</i>
- Ron...

01:11:17.613 --> 01:11:19.865
- Where are you?
<i>- Well, actually I'm...</i>

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.440
You know it's been years
and years and years.

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:27.400
- Well, I know I did.
<i>- So I tried to...</i>

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:34.240
This is not the person I want
you to be.

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:39.920
Mom!

01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:44.240
Did dad ever try to find his parents?
- What?

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:47.200
I thought maybe that's why
he was gone all the times.

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:50.717
- Hey, you know what I was thinking?
- No, almost never.

01:11:50.718 --> 01:11:53.945
We get a way for awhile.
We take a little road trip.

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:56.633
Ron was saying that his parents
owned a restaurant in Fairview.

01:11:56.634 --> 01:11:57.705
Ron?

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:01.200
As in your high school boyfriend, Ron?

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:03.554
Well, we could have dinner with Ron.

01:12:03.555 --> 01:12:06.505
And then just you and me,
we could stayed for a few days.

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:10.440
- Why would we do that?
- Because we never do anything.

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:15.062
We deserve something fun. And 'cause,
it's got... you know all that

01:12:15.063 --> 01:12:18.265
nature and beauty stuff going on.

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:22.597
- I guess...
- Okay, great!

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:26.680
We go packed if we're gonna go.
We should hit the road.

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:10.926
Ron parents owned
"The Two Sister's Cafe"?

01:13:10.927 --> 01:13:13.265
- You've heard of it?
- You haven't heard of it?

01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:16.400
Ron been helping his dad
past few weeks.

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:17.577
He's supposed to leave
this morning but

01:13:17.578 --> 01:13:20.465
he said he'll wait for
us if we came up.

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:26.040
Are you done?

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:46.240
Hi, Lainee.

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:58.440
- This is Lucy.
- Oh... hi!

01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:59.680
Stop staring.

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:06.320
- I like him.
- Yeah, me too.

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:10.000
- He's kind of like your Kenny.
- Yeah, maybe.

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:17.200
Ron owns a restaurant on a beach.
It's like a really high-end place.

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:20.000
- What beach?
- Puerto Vallarta.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:22.120
The Puerto Vallarta that's in Mexico?

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:28.720
- He likes us to come down there.
- Like a vacation?

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:32.262
Ron really, really likes you, Lucy.
You could work

01:15:32.288 --> 01:15:35.625
at a professional kitchen.
We could learn to speak Spanish.

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:39.120
It's the kind of vacation
where I get a job?

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:42.042
He needs to leave tonight. It would
take a couple of days

01:15:42.068 --> 01:15:44.665
to get down there but we could all get
to know each other better in the car.

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:46.735
You realized that's insane, right?

01:15:46.761 --> 01:15:49.465
Right, that's probably
part of the appeal.

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:54.368
Remember when you told me
that you and dad were done?

01:15:54.394 --> 01:15:56.403
Oh actually no, wait.
That's was today!

01:15:56.429 --> 01:15:56.930
No... no!

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.123
This is not about me and your dad.

01:16:00.125 --> 01:16:02.112
No, so what's this about?
Because it's not about

01:16:02.138 --> 01:16:04.170
me working in a professional kitchen.

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:07.000
- It'll be fun.
- Mom, stop! We're not doing this.

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:09.759
You're not the one who decides.
I'm the mom and you're the kid.

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:10.905
Based on what?

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.830
Your great sense of
responsibilities or

01:16:12.831 --> 01:16:14.625
your amazing problem solving skills?

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:17.022
You want us to move
to Puerto Vallarta with

01:16:17.023 --> 01:16:17.988
some stranger from what, God knows...

01:16:17.989 --> 01:16:19.545
No! He's not a stranger!

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:23.872
Lucy, please!
I have to know, I have to do this!

01:16:23.873 --> 01:16:26.408
Have to know what?
How awesome your life

01:16:26.409 --> 01:16:27.585
would've been if I hadn't been born?

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:33.080
God, no! No, Lucy, you're the only
thing that's turned out right.

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:37.400
You're... everything!

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:45.840
I just... I just can't do it anymore.

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:50.080
Can't do what? Be my mom?

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:53.200
I just...

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:58.240
... feel like I'm... like I'm dying.

01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:01.440
I...

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.680
I need something.
I need... something else.

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:15.280
I need to... belong.

01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:20.440
I need to find something.

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:26.520
Okay, mom.

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:34.160
If you need to go... go.

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:43.800
- I can't go without you.
- I'm 16. I'm not pregnant.

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:46.040
I'm not getting married.

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:50.670
Who can take better
care of me than me?

01:17:50.671 --> 01:17:53.442
No, Lucy, I...

01:17:54.290 --> 01:17:55.519
You're gonna make me run
away to Mexico

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:58.825
with you and your
high school boyfriend? No!

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:02.440
You go.

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:15.680
I... I can maybe go for two weeks.

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.880
I'll take it.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.480
- I'll give you the ATM card.
- Okay.

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:29.440
- Okay, two weeks.
- Okay.

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:38.624
<i>Jean Paul Satre said we experience
sense of being abandon</i>

01:18:38.650 --> 01:18:41.505
<i>when we realize there is no God.</i>

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:45.040
<i>- Or in this case parents to guide us.</i>
- I love you.

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:48.472
But it forces us to
take absolute responsibility

01:18:48.473 --> 01:18:50.945
for our actions and choices.

01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:53.920
I think I'm responsible.

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:58.840
You're the most responsible
person that I know.

01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:03.080
Well, you don't know that many people.
- Still, I know a lots of people.

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:10.360
- Did you hear me before?
- I did.

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.840
Thanks for having my back.

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:18.760
Always have.

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:22.360
<i>Always will.</i>

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:39.160
Please don't hate me for this.
I'll call you everyday.

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:51.402
My dad will be back in an hour, so...

01:19:51.403 --> 01:19:53.905
- So I'm sure you would have to meet..
- Yeah, I'll be back in here.

01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:04.280
Hi, I'm Lucy Diamond.

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:08.160
My name is Gerald.

01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:11.320
My mom's the one who ran
away to Mexico with your son.

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:15.520
Yeah, that kind of circle
back around, didn't it?

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:19.560
- Are you hungry?
- What are we serving?

01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:26.280
Eggs in hell. Oh, no offense,
it's just custom sauce.

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:28.280
None taken.

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:42.785
Actually saw this place
on the food network.

01:24:42.786 --> 01:24:44.225
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:49.920
Well, we do okay for a food cafe
stuck out in the middle of nowhere.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:09.840
Nicely done. The Jalapeño doesn't
overpower the other flavours.

01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:14.400
This is like a... plate of
home-cooked Americana.

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:18.080
Cool.

01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:24.400
You know, if you like this,
I make a mean risotto.

01:25:24.835 --> 01:25:25.994
- Oh, I love risotto.
- Yeah.

01:25:26.134 --> 01:25:27.450
It's comfort food.

01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:33.169
<i>Here's how I think my
bigger life will look.</i>

01:25:33.195 --> 01:25:35.745
<i>My parents split up.</i>

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:38.840
<i>I graduated from the

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:44.240

01:25:46.681 --> 01:25:49.785
