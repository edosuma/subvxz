I represent Mr. Catron,

17:38.600 --> 17:43.396

the Catron Bank and Trust

17:43.480 --> 17:45.523

That's a very good start,
Mr. Tunstall.

Now I really do need you
to concentrate right now.

You are involved in an economic

in Lincoln County.

18:56.344 --> 18:59.305
It's a well-established
business,

on making it bankrupt.

19:04.269 --> 19:06.521

19:06.604 --> 19:13.695

a good offer

19:18.491 --> 19:19.784

19:19.868 --> 19:22.704
Now, Mr. Catron
is a very reasonable man.

19:22.787 --> 19:24.664
He won't cheat you.

19:24.747 --> 19:26.624
We'll give you a fair price

and you leave Lincoln County.

19:40.388 --> 19:44.225
It's as simple as that,
Mr. Tunstall.

19:44.309 --> 19:50.231
We are going to court right now
to expose the fraudulent

of the House.

We were so young.

31:09.451 --> 31:12.121
And the more I got to know
your mother,

31:12.204 --> 31:16.917
the more my respect for her grew
and my admiration.

31:17.001 --> 31:22.339
Because she is an amazing woman,
an incredible wife...

31:22.423 --> 31:26.010
and a magnificent mother, too.

31:26.093 --> 31:28.304
But it's wrong.

31:28.387 --> 31:32.474
Everybody should be free
to choose.

31:34.059 --> 31:37.855
And no one has the right
to tell you who to marry.

31:39.481 --> 31:41.942
[sniffles]

31:42.026 --> 31:44.987
I do love you, Papá.

-Yeah.

32:17.227 --> 32:18.979
[man] Jesse, get out of here.

32:24.026 --> 32:26.945
Billy. What you got there?

32:27.029 --> 32:30.949
Presents for y'all,
courtesy of Mr. Tunstall.

32:31.033 --> 32:33.035
[deputy] Now wait a minute.
You can't do that.

32:33.118 --> 32:34.953
-Hey!
-These are for you too, officer.

32:35.037 --> 32:36.622
[Tunstall] No, no.
This is for all of you.

32:36.705 --> 32:40.292
[chuckles]

32:40.376 --> 32:43.170
Mr. Evans. John Tunstall.

32:43.253 --> 32:46.590
Think of it as a, uh,
a peace offering.

33:01.313 --> 33:03.148
What the fuck's
goin' on here, Billy?

33:03.232 --> 33:08.028
We're gettin' you out.

33:08.112 --> 33:10.030
No way.

33:10.114 --> 33:11.031
Yep.

33:11.115 --> 33:13.075
Mr. Tunstall wants it that way.

33:13.158 --> 33:15.244
He wants to make
peace between us.

33:15.327 --> 33:17.454
[scoffs]
This is fucking crazy.

33:17.538 --> 33:19.498

-[gate creaks]

33:22.334 --> 33:24.086
[gate creaks closed]

33:24.169 --> 33:26.130
What in the name of God
is going on here?

33:26.213 --> 33:28.590
Um, Mr. Tunstall said
that you gave permission

33:28.674 --> 33:31.093
for him and his friends
to come in, Sheriff.

33:31.176 --> 33:33.470
Did he indeed?

33:33.554 --> 33:35.305
Take the prisoners
back to the cells

33:35.389 --> 33:38.058
before I lose my fucking temper

33:38.142 --> 33:40.310
and lock all of you
in the cells.

33:40.394 --> 33:42.229
[overlapping chatter]

33:42.312 --> 33:43.105
[Tunstall] Can I talk to you
for a moment, Sheriff?

33:43.188 --> 33:44.273
[Brady] I think you'd better.

33:44.356 --> 33:47.151
-[Brady] Now...
-[man] Move!

33:47.234 --> 33:49.361
[Brady] What's this all about,
Mr. Tunstall?

33:49.445 --> 33:51.280
[Tunstall] Now, Sheriff,
I'm willing to overlook

33:51.363 --> 33:54.116
the theft of my horses,
but these men will still

33:54.199 --> 33:55.659
be tried for attempting
to shoot you.

33:55.743 --> 34:00.664
And, uh, I'd be grateful...

34:00.748 --> 34:04.168
if you would overlook
the incident.

34:07.421 --> 34:09.380
Now we both know
that Mr. Murphy

34:09.465 --> 34:12.176
will be relieved
to get his men back.

34:12.259 --> 34:15.179
I want to try and end this feud,

34:15.262 --> 34:17.556
make peace with Murphy.

34:17.639 --> 34:21.601
Now you can understand that,
can't you?

34:23.353 --> 34:25.688
I don't want it to look
like an inside job.

34:25.773 --> 34:28.525
I'll have most of my deputies
removed for the night.

34:28.609 --> 34:30.569
You're gonna have to break in.

34:30.652 --> 34:32.737
That work for ya?

34:32.821 --> 34:38.494
You're doing
the right thing, Sheriff.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.996
Don't insult my intelligence,
Mr. Tunstall.

35:06.396 --> 35:10.359
[Tunstall] Okay. Now listen up.

35:10.442 --> 35:13.779
You five,
you're going to double back,

35:13.862 --> 35:16.365
you're gonna ride into Lincoln
without being seen,

35:16.448 --> 35:18.325
and then you're gonna
spring Jesse Evans

35:18.408 --> 35:20.410
and his gang from the jail.

35:20.494 --> 35:22.162
[horse whinnies]

35:22.246 --> 35:25.249
Here are the horses
you can use for their escape.

35:25.332 --> 35:27.668
[Billy] You know there'll be
a shooting war.

35:27.751 --> 35:30.128
You saw all those guards.

35:30.212 --> 35:31.755
Sheriff Brady has promised me

35:31.839 --> 35:33.674
that most of them
will be off duty,

35:33.757 --> 35:38.470
and, uh, you'll find ways
of breaking in.

35:38.554 --> 35:43.225
-Why would he do that?
-I made him a very good offer.

35:43.308 --> 35:47.813
After you break them out,
you head to Dick Brewer's ranch.

35:47.896 --> 35:49.439
This escape will be
the beginning

35:49.523 --> 35:51.775
of a new relationship
between my business

35:51.859 --> 35:53.443
and Murphy's business.

35:53.527 --> 35:55.195
Now I hope you're up
for this, gentlemen.

35:55.279 --> 35:57.573
It means a lot to me.

No, sir. But there are some
rocks left outside.

37:18.946 --> 37:20.280
Rocks?

37:20.364 --> 37:21.406
What are you
talkin' about rocks?

37:21.490 --> 37:23.867
So it don't look like
an inside job.

37:25.369 --> 37:27.788
Plenty of rocks.

Hey, Jesse.

38:30.517 --> 38:32.894
Listen, I want you to know
that this is a sincere attempt

38:32.978 --> 38:34.604
by Mr. Tunstall to make peace

38:34.688 --> 38:37.733
between the two sides
and end the war.

He wants Riley and Mr. Murphy
to know that he has no intention

38:42.404 --> 38:44.614
of driving the House
out of business.

38:46.950 --> 38:48.535
The way he sees things,

38:48.618 --> 38:50.704
Lincoln is big enough
for two businesses.

38:50.787 --> 38:52.873
There's no sense in us fighting
and killing each other.

38:52.956 --> 38:56.585
So from now on, we cooperate
or at least co-exist.

38:56.668 --> 38:58.420
What exactly made him
change his mind?

38:58.503 --> 39:01.590
He got real sick in Las Vegas.

39:01.673 --> 39:04.551
Thought maybe he was gonna die.
He reconsidered some things.

are you doing, Jesse?

to explain things to you.

that if I continued my war

I would be killed.

with my stupid plan,

to stand up for me,
