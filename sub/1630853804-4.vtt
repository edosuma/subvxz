It's-it's-it's not a plaything.

11:16.927 --> 11:18.470
- Oh, God, L-Larry, Larry.
- [Larry sighs]

11:18.553 --> 11:19.971
It says I armed the missiles.

11:20.055 --> 11:23.266
- What? Are you serious?
- No.

11:24.601 --> 11:27.562
Not at all. [laughing]

11:27.646 --> 11:28.855
That's not funny.

11:28.939 --> 11:30.315
- Just fucking with you.
- No.

11:30.399 --> 11:31.650
It's not even
a little bit funny.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.318
You have no idea
what's at stake here.

11:33.402 --> 11:36.780
Yeah, yeah, it's the fate
of humanity, I get it.

11:39.032 --> 11:42.702
Look, I need you to listen
for two seconds, okay?

11:42.786 --> 11:45.080
I understand that it's
some abstract thing for you,

11:45.163 --> 11:46.373
but it's not for me.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.583
And if you fuck up,

11:48.667 --> 11:52.129
and you accidentally touch
one of the wrong buttons,

11:52.212 --> 11:53.422
we all die.

11:55.799 --> 11:57.300
Okay?

11:57.384 --> 11:58.760
Okay.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.722
- I'm sorry.
- You should be.

12:04.599 --> 12:08.270
Now, are you ready to start
acting like an adult again?

12:08.353 --> 12:10.397
Fantastic.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.233
Then let's move to the glove.

12:13.316 --> 12:14.860
Slide your hand in,
move it around.

12:14.943 --> 12:17.070
[sighs]

12:19.281 --> 12:21.283
[metallic clanging, whirring]

12:22.742 --> 12:24.119
Holy shit.

12:24.202 --> 12:26.913
Th-That... that's amazing.

12:28.165 --> 12:29.499
[Larry] Yeah.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.086
You should only need to use this

12:33.170 --> 12:34.588
if we have to go manual.
Like, uh,

12:34.671 --> 12:37.215
if we land inside of a building
or something.

12:37.299 --> 12:38.925
Land inside a building?

12:39.009 --> 12:40.635
It's unlikely, but yes.

12:40.719 --> 12:42.220
We should be fine either way,

12:42.304 --> 12:45.807
assuming you're even
a mildly decent pilot,

12:45.891 --> 12:48.226
which feels like it might be--
I don't know--

12:48.310 --> 12:50.770
an unrealistic expectation
at this point. But...

12:53.648 --> 12:55.484
That's well played.

12:55.567 --> 12:56.985
[cell phone ringing]

13:02.407 --> 13:04.743
L-Larry, I-I have to take this.

13:04.826 --> 13:07.370
Well, we're
definitely gonna die.

13:10.665 --> 13:11.958
[exhales]

13:13.543 --> 13:16.713
Okay, I know, I'm sorry,
I missed it. I-I just...

13:16.796 --> 13:18.256
I-I know I should've
called you back.

13:18.340 --> 13:21.301
I've just been really,
um... busy.

13:21.384 --> 13:24.012
I'm standing in your
living room right now.

13:24.095 --> 13:27.015
What? Y...
You went to the house?

13:27.098 --> 13:29.351
Yes. That's what happens
when you don't show up

13:29.434 --> 13:30.560
to sell our mother's house

13:30.644 --> 13:31.937
and refuse to answer
any of my calls.

13:32.020 --> 13:34.731
I drove all the way up
from Columbus,

13:34.814 --> 13:36.733
and you can't even be bothered
to drive five minutes

13:36.816 --> 13:39.152
to the real estate office.

13:39.236 --> 13:41.404
What's going on?

13:42.364 --> 13:43.740
Where are you?

13:43.823 --> 13:44.741
[adult Erin] Uh...

13:44.824 --> 13:46.618
[grunts]

13:46.701 --> 13:48.078
It's kind of hard to explain.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.038
Are you in trouble?

13:50.121 --> 13:52.123
Just... tell me,
I'll come to you.

13:52.207 --> 13:54.876
Uh, no,
Larry wouldn't like that.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.128
- [Missy] Who's Larry?
- [groans]

13:57.212 --> 13:59.714
Okay, tell me where you are,

13:59.798 --> 14:01.633
or I'm calling the cops.

14:06.429 --> 14:08.807
Okay, okay, just hold on.

14:08.890 --> 14:11.017
Hey, hey, Larry, what's your...
what's your address?

14:11.101 --> 14:12.143
[Larry] What?

14:14.563 --> 14:16.022
The child came in last night,

14:16.106 --> 14:18.275
and we had a-a brief interaction

14:18.358 --> 14:21.361
- before a family member
arrived, and...
- [remote beeps]

14:21.444 --> 14:23.697
I released her to his custody.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.407
I understand,

14:25.490 --> 14:26.992
but the file's incomplete,

14:27.075 --> 14:28.785
and our department cannot allow
things like this

14:28.868 --> 14:30.370
to slip through the cracks.

14:30.453 --> 14:33.456
Yes, of course. It's just,

14:33.540 --> 14:36.543
as far as I can gather,
this is a very

14:36.626 --> 14:38.670
compromising situation

14:38.753 --> 14:40.964
for one of our doctors.

14:41.047 --> 14:43.800
Look,
I don't want to get anybody

14:43.883 --> 14:45.510
in trouble here, you know that,

14:45.594 --> 14:48.263
but I got to complete
the file, right?

14:48.346 --> 14:49.848
Why don't you just
give me an address,

14:49.931 --> 14:52.100
and I'll just pop over
for a very discreet follow-up,

14:52.183 --> 14:54.144
no drama, just...

14:54.227 --> 14:56.271
colleague to colleague.

15:08.199 --> 15:11.703
[Donna] Hey, Glen, uh, can you,

15:11.786 --> 15:13.079
uh...

15:13.163 --> 15:15.290
Can you give me some information

15:15.373 --> 15:17.208
on Dr. Coyle?

15:19.711 --> 15:21.296
[adult Erin] I am seen,

15:21.379 --> 15:23.632
and I am worthy.

15:23.715 --> 15:26.801
Emotionally, I'm gonna win.

15:26.885 --> 15:29.471
And in my life...

15:29.554 --> 15:31.056
[sighs]

15:31.139 --> 15:33.558
I'm gonna win. [exhales]

15:36.978 --> 15:39.397
Huh? Hey. What...

15:39.481 --> 15:41.024
Wh-Wh-What are you
doing down here?

15:41.107 --> 15:43.693
It's just Missy's
actually coming here.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.739
- Is she a doctor now?
- No, uh, pilot.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.576
Helicopters. The military
paid for her school and stuff.

15:51.660 --> 15:53.703
Whoa!

15:53.787 --> 15:55.747
Didn't see that coming, um...

15:55.830 --> 15:58.833
Yup. She's a real hero.

16:00.293 --> 16:03.088
But don't get too excited, okay?
She can't see you.

16:03.171 --> 16:04.923
She already thinks I'm nuts.

16:05.006 --> 16:06.341
I just think it's great
that you guys

16:06.424 --> 16:08.259
have a chance to fix everything.

16:08.343 --> 16:10.095
We're not fixing anything.

16:10.178 --> 16:11.429
We're just finishing up
some business

16:11.513 --> 16:12.889
with the house, that's it.

16:14.265 --> 16:16.059
Okay, well, you-you have to try.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.480
You can't erase 20 years
of resentment in one afternoon.

16:20.563 --> 16:23.191
- 20 years...
- Okay, you're stressing me out.

16:23.274 --> 16:24.984
Just...

16:28.988 --> 16:31.241
Just get out of here, will ya?

16:37.831 --> 16:39.416
Don't you remember the time

16:39.499 --> 16:42.419
we accidentally slammed
Missy's fingers on the car door,

16:42.502 --> 16:44.170
and she flipped out
until we sang that dumb song

16:44.254 --> 16:46.172
with Mandarin cuss words?

16:46.256 --> 16:48.800
Uh, no.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.969
Because...

16:51.052 --> 16:52.470
Okay.

16:52.554 --> 16:56.307
You just need to find
the adult version of that.

16:56.391 --> 16:58.768
There is no adult version
of that, okay?

16:58.852 --> 17:00.895
And, besides, Missy,
she's-she's not the same person

17:00.979 --> 17:02.439
she was when you knew her.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.065
Well, what do you mean?

17:04.149 --> 17:05.900
Look, um...

17:07.527 --> 17:10.196
I take no pleasure
in telling you this, but...

17:14.117 --> 17:17.412
Missy wasn't exactly
there for us when Mom got sick.

17:22.584 --> 17:25.378
I-I know that that's a lot,
and I-I promise

17:25.462 --> 17:27.839
that we can talk about it later,
but right now, I just

17:27.922 --> 17:29.591
need you to go upstairs
with the other girls

17:29.674 --> 17:31.092
and stay out of sight.

17:33.553 --> 17:34.763
Hey.

17:34.846 --> 17:37.432
We can't fuck this up.

17:37.515 --> 17:38.767
Okay?

17:40.935 --> 17:42.645
- Okay.
- Let's go. Come on.

17:46.608 --> 17:48.818
[Tiff] Mr. Larry?

17:48.902 --> 17:51.029
Excuse me, Mr. Larry?

17:51.112 --> 17:54.157
Mr. Larry, before you get mad,
I have something for you.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.243
Bongos?

17:57.327 --> 17:58.703
It's not...

17:58.787 --> 18:01.498
It-It's none of your business.
You have ten seconds.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.459
Great. So, since we've decided
to back to 1988,

18:04.542 --> 18:06.753
I've been tracking all of the
events of the morning we left.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.421
Every STF encounter, including

18:08.505 --> 18:09.881
times and locations.

18:09.964 --> 18:12.258
I think I even found
our optimal entry point.

18:17.222 --> 18:19.557
- Bring it here.
- Okay.

18:23.353 --> 18:26.189
This is where everything froze
and the sky went pink?

18:26.272 --> 18:27.524
Yeah.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.609
Yeah, that's what happens
when the Old Watch

18:29.692 --> 18:32.195
wipes people's minds
and-and "fixes" everything.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.738
It's called Ablution.

18:33.822 --> 18:36.825
Wow. Ablution?

18:36.908 --> 18:38.785
It's not a good thing.

18:40.662 --> 18:43.206
Wait, why weren't
our minds wiped, then?

18:47.335 --> 18:49.754
I don't know,
you must've somehow

18:49.838 --> 18:52.257
avoided the beam.
It-It's light-based,

18:52.340 --> 18:53.967
their capture mechanism,

18:54.050 --> 18:56.261
at least to the extent
that we understand it. Th...

18:56.344 --> 18:59.347
The actual mind wiping takes
place on their command ship.

19:02.225 --> 19:04.143
Well, thanks for this, um...

19:04.227 --> 19:05.937
Tiffany.

19:06.020 --> 19:08.064
Tiffany Quilkin.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.941
Thanks, Tiffany.

19:10.024 --> 19:12.193
You're welcome.

19:21.202 --> 19:22.954
Smart kid.

19:24.706 --> 19:27.917
[Erin] I think I'll be able
to see her from here.

19:29.752 --> 19:32.630
[KJ] Well, aren't you supposed
to stay out of sight?

19:32.714 --> 19:34.591
Maybe your sister's
just a bitch and...

19:34.674 --> 19:35.967
- Hey!
- What?

19:36.050 --> 19:38.428
Erin, you're already messing
with your own life,

19:38.511 --> 19:40.638
don't go messing up
Missy's, too.

19:40.722 --> 19:43.057
Okay, is that why you've never
mentioned seeing yourself?

19:44.684 --> 19:46.561
I don't know.

19:46.644 --> 19:48.980
Seriously, though.

19:51.232 --> 19:53.443
I guess I just
don't really care.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.695
Okay, you don't care...
That's impossible.

19:55.778 --> 19:58.197
It's not impossible
'cause I don't care, okay?

19:58.281 --> 20:00.575
If my mother got her way,
I turned out

20:00.658 --> 20:03.077
exactly how she wanted me to,

20:03.161 --> 20:05.371
and I don't need to see that.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.420
I hate this room.

20:17.926 --> 20:20.303
What are you doing?
You just told me

20:20.386 --> 20:21.804
to stay out of sight.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.934
I found a way to Mac.

20:26.017 --> 20:27.060
Really?

20:27.143 --> 20:28.561
Yeah, I used Larry's computer,

20:28.645 --> 20:30.188
and I found
her brother's address.

20:30.271 --> 20:32.148
The way old-you showed us.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.068
You can do that?

20:35.151 --> 20:37.987
Yeah, they've got, like,
maps and everything. It's crazy.

20:41.991 --> 20:44.160
I won't tell if you don't.

20:47.455 --> 20:49.248
[engine starts]

20:49.332 --> 20:51.501
[Dylan] So, listen,
I've been thinking about

20:51.584 --> 20:53.127
how this will work,

20:53.211 --> 20:55.630
making you a permanent part
of the family and everything.

20:55.713 --> 20:57.340
One day, in a couple of weeks,

20:57.423 --> 20:59.258
we'll get some bad news
about Jo's mom.

20:59.342 --> 21:01.177
She has a nasty relapse,

21:01.260 --> 21:03.137
she disappears, and...

21:03.221 --> 21:05.390
then I'll have the adoption talk
with Jennifer.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.183
Adoption?

21:08.810 --> 21:11.813
- So you'd be my dad?
- Uh... [laughs]

21:11.896 --> 21:13.898
Man, that's weird.

21:13.982 --> 21:16.192
[Dylan] Yeah, yeah,
it's super weird.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.486
But it won't always be.

21:18.569 --> 21:20.530
We'll get used to it.

21:20.613 --> 21:24.075
Soon enough, we'll enroll you
here at Buttonwood.

21:24.158 --> 21:26.077
We'll-we'll get you,
uh, a tutor,

21:26.160 --> 21:27.453
so you can catch up
with your grade level.

21:27.537 --> 21:29.789
We'll... we'll find you
some extracurriculars.

21:29.872 --> 21:33.668
Well, that sure seems like
a lot of work for a dead person.

21:33.751 --> 21:35.378
[Dylan] You're not
a dead person.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.171
I want you to stop saying that.

21:38.423 --> 21:39.924
Okay, Dad.

21:41.676 --> 21:43.094
[Dylan] Hey, hey, hey, guys.

21:43.177 --> 21:44.387
Hey, I want you
to meet somebody.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.222
This is, uh,

21:46.305 --> 21:48.057
this is my cousin,
second cousin.

21:48.141 --> 21:49.642
Why is she wearing
my leather jacket?

21:49.726 --> 21:52.311
[Dylan] Because I loaned it
to her, honey.

21:52.395 --> 21:54.480
- Sorry.
- Well, I wish you'd asked.

21:54.564 --> 21:58.526
Please, just get in the car,
and we can talk about it, okay?

21:58.609 --> 21:59.777
Oh, hi.

21:59.861 --> 22:01.612
I'm Alice.

22:03.698 --> 22:05.324
Hi.

22:09.787 --> 22:12.123
[Dylan] All right, hop in.

22:13.791 --> 22:15.793
[ticking]

22:30.641 --> 22:32.560
So, how'd you two meet, again?

22:32.643 --> 22:34.854
Uh, you know, we...

22:34.937 --> 22:37.106
Just... It's funny,
we-we ran into each other,

22:37.190 --> 22:39.484
and, um, and then just,
sparks flew.

22:39.567 --> 22:41.319
[both chuckle]

22:41.402 --> 22:43.821
I-I guess I really, um...

22:43.905 --> 22:45.573
- knocked her off her feet.
- Oh.

22:45.656 --> 22:47.700
[both laughing]

22:53.664 --> 22:56.125
- [adult Erin] Mm.
- [Larry] Hey.

22:56.209 --> 22:59.003
- I love you.
- [whispers] I love you, Larry.

22:59.087 --> 23:00.880
Yeah. Thank you.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.758
So, I guess you know all about
our mother's death, then?

23:03.841 --> 23:05.593
Of course he does.

23:05.676 --> 23:07.053
He can't speak for himself?

23:07.136 --> 23:09.222
No, I-I can. I can, of course.

23:09.305 --> 23:13.142
Uh, and I-I-I'd
just like to say, um...

23:15.311 --> 23:17.688
...sounds like she
put up a good fight.

23:23.444 --> 23:25.446
[engine rumbling]

23:26.739 --> 23:28.783
[Larry] Uh, I'll just

23:28.866 --> 23:31.536
let you two ladies chat.

23:31.619 --> 23:33.246
- It was so nice
to meet you, Misty.
- Um, Missy.

23:33.329 --> 23:34.580
[Larry] Missy. Right.

23:34.664 --> 23:36.624
Sorry.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.631
[panting]

23:43.714 --> 23:44.966
Goddamn it.

23:45.049 --> 23:47.260
Goddamn it!

23:54.851 --> 23:56.185
Uh...

23:56.269 --> 23:58.479
[Larry] Oh, mama!

23:58.563 --> 24:01.607
So, you're a fucking bike thief.
These fucking kids!

24:01.691 --> 24:03.693
These fucking kids.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.279
Is he taking your money?

24:06.362 --> 24:08.322
Jesus... No.

24:08.406 --> 24:11.200
He's my boyfriend.

24:11.284 --> 24:14.245
I mean, is it really so weird
I'd have a boyfriend?

24:19.834 --> 24:22.128
Missy, why are you grilling me?

24:22.211 --> 24:24.213
I'm an adult.
I can do whatever I want.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.846
[Missy] Are you still
taking your meds?

24:35.433 --> 24:36.934
[scoffs]

24:38.394 --> 24:40.938
[adult Erin] D-Did you really
just ask me that?

24:41.022 --> 24:42.982
[Missy] It's
a legitimate question.

24:43.065 --> 24:45.860
- [adult Erin] Yes, Missy,
I'm taking my meds.
- [Missy] Okay.

24:45.943 --> 24:47.403
[adult Erin] I'm also
taking care of, literally,

24:47.486 --> 24:48.571
everything else.

24:48.654 --> 24:50.239
Including packing up
our family home

24:50.323 --> 24:52.909
without asking you to lift
so much as a fucking finger.

24:52.992 --> 24:55.244
And now you're holed up on some
farm with a man who's clearly

24:55.328 --> 24:56.662
unstable in some way,

24:56.746 --> 24:58.789
and you don't even
show up this morning.

24:58.873 --> 25:00.333
[adult Erin] That's
what this is all about,

25:00.416 --> 25:02.376
the money for the house.

25:02.460 --> 25:05.296
You know it's not
about the money.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.008
Do I?

25:17.225 --> 25:20.061
[door opens, closes]

25:35.243 --> 25:37.119

25:46.128 --> 25:48.422
[inhales sharply]

26:04.522 --> 26:07.275
[heavy breathing]

26:10.569 --> 26:12.446
[Erin] I need your help.

26:12.530 --> 26:14.365
[whispering] What the hell
are you doing in here?

26:14.448 --> 26:16.033
Sorry, I just...

26:17.785 --> 26:19.328
I need, I need to talk to you.

26:19.412 --> 26:21.664
I told you to stay out of sight.

26:24.667 --> 26:26.419

26:39.223 --> 26:41.017
[screen door creaks open]

26:49.692 --> 26:52.111
[Missy] I, um...

26:52.194 --> 26:55.114
I forgot my bag. I need...

26:55.197 --> 26:56.782
Yeah.

26:59.493 --> 27:01.329
Thanks.

27:01.412 --> 27:03.622
Um, Missy, it's...

27:08.336 --> 27:10.504
It's been a tough year.

27:10.588 --> 27:14.508
I wish you would've reached out.

27:14.592 --> 27:17.720
Well, you have... kids,

27:17.803 --> 27:21.015
and a career, and a husband.

27:21.098 --> 27:23.392
I mean, th-there was
no need for both of us

27:23.476 --> 27:24.810
to go through all that.

27:26.354 --> 27:29.065
I didn't ask you
to spare me, Erin.

27:31.525 --> 27:33.069
Are you mad about that?

27:33.152 --> 27:34.820
No. I just

27:34.904 --> 27:36.572
never asked you to be a martyr.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.077
Well, I-I'm not a martyr, but...

27:41.160 --> 27:44.372
Mom needed care
around the clock.

27:44.455 --> 27:46.165
Believe me, I did you a favor.

27:46.248 --> 27:47.958
- A favor?
- Yeah.

27:48.042 --> 27:50.586
A pretty big one, if you ask me.

27:50.669 --> 27:53.547
Okay, so I guess
you'd like a thank you, then?

27:53.631 --> 27:55.758
- I never said that.
- You didn't have to.

27:55.841 --> 27:58.594
I know that's what you're
waiting for, so here it is.

27:58.677 --> 28:01.639
Thank you, Erin,
for robbing me of a relationship

28:01.722 --> 28:04.475
with my mother
in her final years.

28:04.558 --> 28:06.560
How can I ever repay you?

28:11.774 --> 28:13.234
Missy...

28:13.317 --> 28:15.152
Come on, I never...

28:15.236 --> 28:16.529
You know I never meant
to do that.

28:16.612 --> 28:19.073
It doesn't matter
what you meant. It's done.

28:26.747 --> 28:29.333

[Larry] Jesus Christ.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.478
Of course you're not
where you're supposed to be.

28:49.562 --> 28:50.688
I'm sorry.

28:50.771 --> 28:53.482
[sighs] Hey,
you know your friend?

28:53.566 --> 28:55.651
The one who stole my bike?

28:55.734 --> 28:58.279
You're probably
never gonna see her again.

28:58.362 --> 29:01.157
I know. I-I tried to stop her,
but nobody listens to me.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.242
The Old Watch kills
time travelers, okay?

29:03.325 --> 29:04.743
Do you get that?

29:10.583 --> 29:12.001
I do.

29:13.669 --> 29:15.963
But I don't want her
to die, okay?

29:18.424 --> 29:20.634
I-I don't want any of us to die.

29:20.718 --> 29:22.386
I...

29:24.180 --> 29:26.682
I'm sorry. I-I shouldn't
have shouted at you. Uh...

29:26.765 --> 29:28.726
We've only got
a couple of hours,

29:28.809 --> 29:31.312
- and I'm just scared.
- It's fine.

29:33.147 --> 29:35.483
Hey, do you want to see
something cool?

29:35.566 --> 29:37.234
Yeah.

29:37.318 --> 29:39.695
Okay, yeah.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.113
[Larry] Must've been
a couple years

29:41.197 --> 29:43.532
younger than you when
my grandfather informed me

29:43.616 --> 29:46.160
I wasn't getting a free ride.

29:46.243 --> 29:47.495
What does that mean?

29:47.578 --> 29:50.039
The Radakowski Farmer's Almanac.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.957
It's basically a bible
of every detail

29:52.041 --> 29:53.918
regarding weather conditions
here on the farm.

29:54.001 --> 29:56.128
If my grandfather
hadn't kept me here

29:56.212 --> 29:58.172
and forced me

29:58.255 --> 30:00.758
to log every... [chuckles]

30:00.841 --> 30:05.221
...light breeze and-and-and
drop of boring rain,

30:05.304 --> 30:08.182
I'd have never been prepared

30:08.265 --> 30:10.184
to do this.

30:13.646 --> 30:15.564
I don't understand any of it.

30:15.648 --> 30:18.317
That's because I encoded
the information to keep it safe.

30:21.070 --> 30:23.822
exactly where and when

Wait, what's a folding?

30:26.116 --> 30:28.869
The secret back roads
of time travel.

30:33.707 --> 30:35.834
- And we took one of those here?
- Mm-hmm.

30:35.918 --> 30:38.045
This one here.
This is the big enchilada.

a few hours now,

30:39.463 --> 30:40.839

30:40.923 --> 30:42.675
and I've been waiting

30:42.758 --> 30:45.803
a long time for this one.

30:45.886 --> 30:48.222
Whoa.

30:48.305 --> 30:50.975
I spent so long hating
every acre of this farm,

30:51.058 --> 30:53.185
and my grandfather,

30:53.269 --> 30:55.854
and the responsibility,
and the corn, but...

30:58.816 --> 31:01.026
...it was never about the corn.

31:04.238 --> 31:05.906
It's like you were chosen.

31:09.910 --> 31:11.287
I was.

31:12.830 --> 31:16.000
Maybe that means
that I was chosen, too.

31:16.083 --> 31:18.043
Yeah, maybe.
