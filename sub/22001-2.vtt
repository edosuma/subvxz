WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:03.037
She's coming in hot.
She's The Mick.

00:03.071 --> 00:05.173
-Yaah!
-I just built that.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.407
It didn't take.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.476
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.511
And check out our other Fox
programs-- Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

00:10.544 --> 00:12.380
The Last Man on Earth and
Ghosted.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.548
I don't really know how
to do any of this stuff.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.686
MAN (on TV):
I thought you were dead.

00:18.719 --> 00:21.089
WOMAN: You can't get rid of me
that easily.

00:21.122 --> 00:24.992
MAN: The accident, you were
under the water too long.
(laughs): Oh, yeah.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.760
I knew that conniving bitch
was alive.

00:26.794 --> 00:28.362
Oh, yeah, no.

00:28.396 --> 00:30.831
His wife is going to freak
when she sees them kissing.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.733
WOMAN (on TV): Max, wait, Max.
That is his wife.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.102
What? I thought
that was his daughter.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.204
Why would he be having
sex with his daughter?

00:36.237 --> 00:37.671
I don't know. Drama?

00:37.705 --> 00:38.839
Can you pay
attention, please?
I...

00:38.872 --> 00:40.040
I-It's just, it's
really irritating

00:40.074 --> 00:41.041
to have to explain
everything.

00:41.075 --> 00:42.910
(lamp crackles, Jimmy yells)
Oh! My...

00:42.943 --> 00:44.445
All right. Yeah,
that's my bad.

00:44.478 --> 00:45.746
I shorted it.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.115
Can you stop
with the home repairs?

00:47.148 --> 00:48.349
You're driving me crazy.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.418
Please!
Absolutely not, okay?

00:50.451 --> 00:51.885
Aunt Mickey, can you
please tell Sabrina

00:51.919 --> 00:53.354
to let us sleep
in her room?

00:53.387 --> 00:55.022
Sabrina, let them
sleep in your room.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.625
Mind your own
business, moron.
I tried.

00:57.658 --> 01:00.027
This is not fair! We have a
frickin' squirrel in ours!

01:00.060 --> 01:01.529
Can you just deal with it?

01:01.562 --> 01:03.297
The fire affected everybody,
okay? Not just you.

01:03.331 --> 01:04.598
My toys melted.

01:04.632 --> 01:05.599
His toys melted.

01:05.633 --> 01:06.700
He started it.

01:06.734 --> 01:07.901
Her room is fine.

01:07.935 --> 01:09.270
I am the one getting
screwed here.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.439
(all shout)

01:12.740 --> 01:13.741
Uh...

01:14.775 --> 01:17.145
(yells)

01:20.181 --> 01:22.250
That's gonna set me back
a few days.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.919
(muffled screaming)

01:25.953 --> 01:28.822
Guys, you know, I'm just
gonna get out of the house

01:28.856 --> 01:30.224
for a little bit.

01:30.258 --> 01:31.825
You know, just before
I lose my mind.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.828
If anybody needs me,
I will be at the gym.

01:34.862 --> 01:35.996
ALBA:
What?

01:36.029 --> 01:37.331
Did you say, "the gym"?

01:37.365 --> 01:39.567
Yep. I've been using
Poodle's membership.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.235
Seems a little out of
character for you.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.604
Yeah. What do
you do there?

01:43.637 --> 01:45.173
Study for the SATs, Jimmy.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.574
What the hell do you
think I do there?

01:46.607 --> 01:48.309
SABRINA:
Just be careful, okay?

01:48.342 --> 01:49.943
It's dangerous
for somebody in your shape

01:49.977 --> 01:51.312
to suddenly
start working out.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.547
Most people in your shape
are boys.

01:54.848 --> 01:57.117
(chuckles) Oh.
WOMAN (on TV): Max, wait, Max...

01:58.452 --> 02:01.088
I knew it. I knew it.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.823
You two-timing slut.

02:02.856 --> 02:04.525
All right,
let's go, fatty.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.294
Go! All right.

02:06.327 --> 02:09.563
(panting)

02:11.699 --> 02:13.701
(whoops)
All right.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.603
Whoa.
Hey. Hey!

02:15.636 --> 02:16.637
Hello.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.606
Nope. I'm just trying to...

02:18.639 --> 02:19.940
Hey, do you think
that you could

02:19.973 --> 02:21.275
scoot over a little bit?
Huh?

02:21.309 --> 02:22.676
There's just nobody here,
so there's no reason

02:22.710 --> 02:24.044
for us to be so close
to each other.
(gasps)

02:24.077 --> 02:25.779
Whoa!

02:25.813 --> 02:27.315
(laughing):
Oh.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.283
Whoa. Are you okay?

02:29.317 --> 02:30.951
Oh, yes.
Great.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.387
'Cause if I were you,
I would be super embarrassed.

02:33.421 --> 02:35.789
(cries)
No, no, I was just joking.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.725
(crying)
Oh. It was just a joke.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.460
Please don't cry.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.195
(groans)

02:41.229 --> 02:42.696
It's not that.

02:42.730 --> 02:45.065
It's my ex-husband
is getting remarried

02:45.098 --> 02:48.702
(crying): and I have to
lose 20 pounds by Saturday.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.705
(crying)
(groans)
Yeah, well...

02:51.739 --> 02:54.141
sounds like you got
your work cut out for you,

02:54.174 --> 02:56.143
so I'll just
leave you to it.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.212
I mean, you get divorced

02:58.246 --> 03:01.349
and then all of a sudden
you're like this dolphin

03:01.382 --> 03:03.150
that's been in captivity
that just

03:03.183 --> 03:04.752
gets released back
into the ocean.

03:04.785 --> 03:07.087
Most of those dolphins,
they just die.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.390
Well, listen, if it
makes you feel any better,

03:09.423 --> 03:11.259
I saw a TV show
about how male dolphins,

03:11.292 --> 03:13.394
they just force themselves
on the female dolphins.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.195
That was a show?
Yeah.

03:15.229 --> 03:16.330
So, they're
basically just, like,

03:16.364 --> 03:17.731
the sexual predators
of the sea.

03:17.765 --> 03:20.368
It's just I'm alone
in this giant house

03:20.401 --> 03:22.002
with nobody to talk
to and I feel like

03:22.035 --> 03:24.705
(laughs): I'm kind of
losing my mind.

03:24.738 --> 03:27.275
You're all alone
in a giant house?

03:27.308 --> 03:28.409
(chuckles)
(sniffles)

03:28.442 --> 03:29.610
I'm Trish, by the way.

03:29.643 --> 03:32.045
(sniffles)
Mickey.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.113
Are you serious?
You've had work done?

03:33.146 --> 03:34.282
You look amazing.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.850
Well, yeah, duh,
'cause of the work.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.386
Is it, is it
okay if I...?

03:38.419 --> 03:39.687
Do you want
to touch my boobs?

03:39.720 --> 03:40.888
Yes. Is that all right?

03:40.921 --> 03:42.256
Okay.

03:42.290 --> 03:43.791
Oh, wow. Nice.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.359
Very real, very real.

03:45.393 --> 03:47.295
That's 'cause
they are real.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.297
I had some Botox.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.899
(both laugh)

03:51.932 --> 03:53.534
Well, that makes more
sense, doesn't it?
Yeah.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.935
Okay. Sorry about that.
Okay.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.804
There you go. I'm just gonna
go to the bathroom real fast.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.939
Okay. Just pick
a door, any door.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.741
Okay. Thanks for
that, by the way.

04:00.774 --> 04:01.909
(shouts)
Oh!

04:01.942 --> 04:03.311
Sorry.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.779
God! You stupid beast!

04:05.813 --> 04:06.814
Oh.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.882
(laughs)
Just kidding.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.218
Oh. (laughs)
Yeah.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.921
You know what, just smash
whatever you want around here.
Yeah?

04:13.954 --> 04:16.223
This piece of garbage?
No, no, please, God.
Put it down. Please,

04:16.256 --> 04:17.658
please, please, please.
Thanks.
That was just a
joke. I won't.

04:17.691 --> 04:18.792
I definitely won't.
No, I got it in Venice.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.294
It was...
but anything else.

04:20.328 --> 04:21.929
Right.
This place is
going to crap.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.297
I keep meaning to get a guy

04:23.331 --> 04:24.898
who can kind of fix
some stuff, but...

04:24.932 --> 04:26.800
I got a guy who can
kind of fix some stuff.

04:26.834 --> 04:29.470
You got a guy that can
kind of fix some stuff?
Yeah.

04:29.503 --> 04:30.804
Yeah, I could bring
him over tomorrow.

04:30.838 --> 04:33.140
Is it too soon to tell you
that I love you?

04:33.173 --> 04:34.608
Too soon to tell you

04:34.642 --> 04:36.176
I want to swim another
lap in those boobs?

04:36.209 --> 04:38.512
(chuckles)
Kind of.

04:38.546 --> 04:40.147
(grunts)

04:40.180 --> 04:42.282
Honestly, I don't even want
to sleep in Sabrina's room.

04:42.316 --> 04:43.751
I'm not scared
of no frickin' squirrel.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.018
If that thing comes at me,

04:45.052 --> 04:47.621
I'll just be like, boosh!

04:47.655 --> 04:49.357
How ya like me now,
squirrel?

04:49.390 --> 04:51.925
Besides, I mean,
it's pretty cool you're getting

04:51.959 --> 04:53.193
to live with your
older brother, right?

04:53.226 --> 04:54.362
I guess.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.864
Just, uh, don't mess
with my stuff

04:56.897 --> 04:58.031
or I'll frickin' kill you.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.433
Okay.

04:59.467 --> 05:00.701
My nips are mad
frickin' hard.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.135
Check them out.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.974
Hey, pop quiz.
Who wins in a fight?

05:07.007 --> 05:08.676
King cobra or
king crab? Go.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.177
Cobra?

05:10.210 --> 05:11.278
(imitates buzzer)

05:11.311 --> 05:12.279
Crab?

05:12.312 --> 05:13.514
No, trick question.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.549
King cobra would
never fight a king crab.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.718
They're both apex predators.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.487
I'm gonna go get
a glass of water.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.888
Hey, dude, good call.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.756
Hydration is mad
frickin' important.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.660
No.
No what?

05:26.694 --> 05:28.195
No, you can't stay with me.

05:28.228 --> 05:29.630
I'm sorry that you have
a squirrel problem, but...

05:29.663 --> 05:31.031
It's not
about the squirrel.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.299
I like the squirrel.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.201
He's my friend.
His name is Peter.

05:34.234 --> 05:35.369
We have a secret language.

05:35.403 --> 05:36.470
Get to the point, Ben.

05:36.504 --> 05:38.138
It's about Chip.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.508
What about him?

05:40.541 --> 05:42.410
He makes me
feel weird sometimes,

05:42.443 --> 05:46.179
like I want him to stop saying
stuff and doing stuff.

05:46.213 --> 05:49.850
Yeah. I figured this day
would come.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.284
Hop up, buddy.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.856
Okay, first of all,
the feelings that you have

05:55.889 --> 05:57.024
are perfectly normal.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.258
They are?
Yeah.

05:58.291 --> 06:00.160
The reason Chip
makes you feel weird

06:00.193 --> 06:02.530
is because Chip sucks.

06:02.563 --> 06:04.432
But he's our brother.
I know,

06:04.465 --> 06:05.766
and we love him,
but that doesn't mean

06:05.799 --> 06:07.000
we have to like him.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.102
I don't get it.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.438
It's unrealistic to expect

06:10.471 --> 06:12.205
to like every member
of your family.

06:12.239 --> 06:14.542
And in ours, the person
nobody likes is Chip.

06:14.575 --> 06:17.344
He's annoying and
painfully unfunny.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.346
He's got that weird obsession
with his nipples lately.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.415
It wasn't a problem before,
but it's hard

06:21.449 --> 06:23.083
now that I got
to live with him.

06:23.116 --> 06:25.018
Tell you what.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.687
Why don't you crash with
me for a little while?

06:26.720 --> 06:28.255
Really?
Yeah.

06:28.288 --> 06:30.858
While I do not care about
your squirrel problem,

06:30.891 --> 06:32.560
I am sympathetic
to your Chip problem.

06:34.595 --> 06:37.565
(gagging)

06:37.598 --> 06:41.234
Ugh. I knew that bitch
was coming back.

06:41.268 --> 06:43.236
WOMAN (on TV): ...too busy
to look into his eyes.

06:43.270 --> 06:44.538
(Mickey shouts)

06:44.572 --> 06:45.573
JIMMY:
Hey, come on!

06:45.606 --> 06:46.974
I just built that.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.576
Yeah, well,
it didn't take.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.611
(chuckles)
What are you
so happy about?

06:50.644 --> 06:52.079
I don't know, maybe 'cause

06:52.112 --> 06:54.147
I just made my first friend
in Greenwich.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.484
First friend?
You guys, finally,

06:56.517 --> 06:59.953
after months of-of-of
self-medicating

06:59.987 --> 07:02.389
and-and loneliness
in this horrific town,

07:02.422 --> 07:04.825
I finally found someone
I want to hang out with.

07:04.858 --> 07:07.761
What a trying time
this must have been for you.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.296
That actually reminds me,
um, Jimmy,

07:09.329 --> 07:11.264
I volunteered you
to go over and help out

07:11.298 --> 07:13.400
with some handiwork stuff
around her house.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.136
(groans)
Well, well, well.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.338
Looks like somebody
respects my work after all.

07:18.371 --> 07:19.473
That's not what I said.

07:19.507 --> 07:20.808
Well, if you're
farming me out,

07:20.841 --> 07:22.476
I must be the best
handyman you know.

07:22.510 --> 07:23.911
You're the only handyman I know.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.613
So you do think of me
as a handyman.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.848
I think of you as a man
with hands.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.416
I will take that.
Okay.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.251
All right, I'm gonna
go to bed.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.920
Wait, wait, wait.
What about our shows?

07:32.953 --> 07:36.123
I re-watch everything, so
I know what is happening.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.191
Oh, yeah, no, Trish and I
just kind of

07:38.225 --> 07:39.827
blazed right through
season three.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.294
I did black out
somewhere

07:41.328 --> 07:42.496
around Ms. Carrington's funeral,

07:42.530 --> 07:44.698
Whoa! Spoiler!
so let me know what happens.

07:44.732 --> 07:45.799
Oh, uh, well,

07:45.833 --> 07:47.167
here's another spoiler
for you:

07:47.200 --> 07:49.169
I'm gonna go take a two.
(chuckles)

07:55.909 --> 07:57.845
(doorbell rings)
TRISH: Hello?

07:57.878 --> 08:00.347
(deep voice):
I'm here to rape and murder you!

08:00.380 --> 08:03.283
TRISH:
Mickey! Come on in, girl.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.385
So, I told him,
I said, "Look,

08:05.418 --> 08:08.288
"I don't care if she's my
superior officer and a woman,

08:08.321 --> 08:10.490
"if your underwear is sticking
out of the top of your pants,

08:10.524 --> 08:11.892
you're getting a wedgie."

08:11.925 --> 08:13.694
(both laugh)
Mickey!

08:13.727 --> 08:15.328
Hey...

08:15.362 --> 08:17.998
Jimmy was just telling me about
the week he spent in the Army.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.667
Right on.
He tell you about that month

08:19.700 --> 08:20.901
he spent in
a homeless shelter?

08:20.934 --> 08:23.003
Ah, well, all
in due time.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.539
Yeah, speaking of time, you've
been here since 9:00 a.m.

08:25.573 --> 08:27.675
How long does it take
to do some basic repairs?

08:27.708 --> 08:30.210
Oh, well, the contractor of
this place is a real nudnik.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.412
Hmm.
Which reminds me,
if I get some time,

08:32.445 --> 08:34.748
I'd like to come back here
and get inside the walls.

08:34.782 --> 08:36.416
Well, we're not gonna open up
the walls, but thank you anyway.

08:36.449 --> 08:37.551
You know what, actually,
you can...

08:37.585 --> 08:39.052
you can go.
You can go.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.921
Oh. Okay.

08:40.954 --> 08:44.658
Well, um, here.
Take this pizza with you.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.927
I mean, I have days
until my ex's wedding,

08:46.960 --> 08:48.929
and this freak has me
eating pizza.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.198
Come on, a little slice
never hurt anybody.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.333
(all chuckle)

08:53.366 --> 08:55.035
Bye.
MICKEY:
Ugh.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.037
Sorry about him.
He never leaves.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.205
It's kind of his thing.
Mm-hmm.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.407
What's his deal?

09:00.440 --> 09:03.911
Uh, well, for starters,
he's your basic moron.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.713
Do you think he'd
have a drink with me?

09:05.746 --> 09:09.917
Oh... um...

09:09.950 --> 09:11.451
Wait, are you
guys a thing?

09:11.484 --> 09:12.753
No.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.254
That is cra...
Are you insane?

09:14.287 --> 09:15.756
Me with-- no.

09:15.789 --> 09:18.058
Okay. Are you sure?
Yeah. Please. I mean,

09:18.091 --> 09:20.027
by all means, have a drink
with him, you know?

09:20.060 --> 09:22.429
If you want to have the worst
night of your life, be my guest.

09:22.462 --> 09:24.497
Yeah!
Are you gonna...?
'Cause I...

09:28.836 --> 09:30.804
Yeah, I don't get it.

09:30.838 --> 09:33.106
You want me to
take Trish out to dinner?

09:33.140 --> 09:34.107
That's correct.

09:34.141 --> 09:36.476
I'm confused.
Okay.

09:36.509 --> 09:39.212
Well, you do understand
what dinner is, right?

09:39.246 --> 09:41.081
Yeah. But you're not
coming with us?

09:41.114 --> 09:42.750
Am I being unclear
in any way?

09:42.783 --> 09:44.551
No, no, I understand you
completely.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.987
She gets it and she can't
even follow a simple TV show.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.256
Well, what can I say?
I get you.

09:49.289 --> 09:52.092
So, this is like a...
like a date?

09:52.125 --> 09:53.460
It's whatever
you want it to be.

09:53.493 --> 09:54.762
No, that's great.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.063
And then while you're
doing that,

09:56.096 --> 09:57.665
we can have
a classic girls' night.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.967
Oh. Yeah, maybe.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.234
Eh, I don't know.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.670
We'll play it
by ear, you know.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.104
My tank's a little empty

10:04.137 --> 10:05.238
after spending the
whole day with Trish,

10:05.272 --> 10:06.239
but we'll see how I feel.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.141
Have fun.

10:11.478 --> 10:12.980
Greetings, siblings.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.514
How's the new
roommate sitch?

10:14.547 --> 10:15.983
So far, so good.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.651
Aw, isn't that wonderful.

10:17.685 --> 10:20.153
Oh, and just so you know,
there's no hard feelings.

10:20.187 --> 10:21.621
I think this is for the best.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.023
Good. Us, too.

10:23.056 --> 10:25.325
As the man of the house,
I feel like it's my duty

10:25.358 --> 10:26.860
to protect you guys
from the squirrel.

10:26.894 --> 10:30.097
So... let's just hope
I don't get murdered.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.299
By a squirrel?
Who knows?

10:32.332 --> 10:35.035
Could bite my face off,
or it could chew up my privates

10:35.068 --> 10:37.871
until I bleed out
and I'm gone forever.

10:37.905 --> 10:40.040
Yeah, well, we'll keep
our fingers crossed.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.682
So annoying.
Big time.

10:48.716 --> 10:51.551
Okay, hey, I was not annoying!
I was cool, but modest!

10:51.584 --> 10:53.186
I was generous,
but not overbearing.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.455
Why do you guys keep
talking trash about me?

10:55.488 --> 10:57.791
It's okay, Ben.
Go ahead.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.693
BEN:
Sorry, Chip.

10:59.727 --> 11:01.061
I didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.195
You're just...

11:03.563 --> 11:05.699
...kind of annoying sometimes.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.167
(sighs)

11:07.200 --> 11:09.703
But, but I-I'm
your older brother.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.004
I'm supposed to be your idol.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.472
And-and, Sabrina,

11:12.505 --> 11:13.741
you're supposed to
look out of me.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.475
You're supposed to
hook me up with your friends

11:15.508 --> 11:17.344
so I can learn about sex,
a-and then we talk about it

11:17.377 --> 11:19.412
and you teach me
how to be even hotter.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.581
You want me to watch you
have sex with my friends?

11:21.614 --> 11:23.884
What?! No!

11:23.917 --> 11:26.153
No, we just, we talk about it.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.320
We're supposed
to be tight.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.889
You guys really think
I'm annoying?

11:28.922 --> 11:30.590
Yeah.
Yeah.

11:30.623 --> 11:33.260
Oh...

11:33.293 --> 11:36.396
Fine. I'll, uh...

11:36.429 --> 11:38.398
I guess I'll just leave, then.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.400
Be out of here
faster than a cheetah,

11:40.433 --> 11:42.069
the fastest animal
in the world.

11:44.371 --> 11:47.607
Ha! A cheetah isn't the fastest.
A peregrine falcon is.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.642
Idiots!

11:51.611 --> 11:53.613
MAN (on TV):
He has my eyes.

11:53.646 --> 11:56.183
WOMAN (on TV): You've been
too busy to look into his eyes.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.617
What the hell
is going on?

11:57.650 --> 11:59.086
Oh, it's a good one.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.788
He just learned that
the boy he raised

12:00.821 --> 12:03.190
is the bastard son
of his business partner.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.926
That's not at all
what's happening.
Hmm?

12:05.959 --> 12:07.194
That's not even what
I'm talking about.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.461
I'm talking about Jimmy.
Where is he?

12:08.495 --> 12:09.763
It's almost midnight.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.932
What are you worried about?
Relax.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.233
Have some Molly.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.202
You know, he probably
already blew it.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.937
Hey, how many times
you think he's farted,

12:16.970 --> 12:19.306
and then said,
"Who just farted in my pants?"

12:19.339 --> 12:20.640
(both laugh)

12:20.673 --> 12:22.542
Loser.
What a boner.

12:22.575 --> 12:23.977
(Jimmy shouts)

12:24.912 --> 12:26.113
God...

12:34.621 --> 12:35.789
Hello, ladies.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.224
Why is your mouth all red?

12:37.257 --> 12:40.060
Oh, Trish and I got cranked
on sangria.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.962
(chuckles)
You hate sangria.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.396
Yeah, I thought so, too.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.265
Turns out I hate
your sangria.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.766
Trish makes a mean batch.

12:46.800 --> 12:47.968
Huh.
Hmm.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.236
We'll have to check that out.
Mm-hmm.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.004
Yeah.
Anyway, thank you so much again.

12:51.038 --> 12:53.106
Uh, you are relieved
of your duties.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.175
Well, not quite.
She asked me to be her date

12:55.208 --> 12:56.309
to her ex's wedding.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.111
Huh.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.746
Are you gonna do it?

12:59.779 --> 13:00.747
Well, what do you think?

13:00.780 --> 13:04.317
Of course I'm going.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.686
Oh, I should work on my toast.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.691
Wow, that's kind of
messed up.

13:11.724 --> 13:14.094
Hmm.
What?

13:14.127 --> 13:16.864
Well, Trish moving in
on Jimmy like that.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.698
What happened
to girl code?
No.

13:18.731 --> 13:19.967
She didn't do
anything wrong.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.501
She asked me,
I told her--

13:21.534 --> 13:23.436
Jimmy and I are not...
there's nothing.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.804
Oh, no, it doesn't matter.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.473
A true friend would never
do that to you.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.375
It is kind of
a bitch move, isn't it?

13:28.408 --> 13:30.343
Oh, yeah, a real bitch play.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.512
Hmm, I'm gonna go to bed.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.514
Okay.

13:34.547 --> 13:35.815
Good night, Mickey.

13:35.849 --> 13:38.718
Oh, yes,

13:38.751 --> 13:41.154
all the pieces are
falling into place.

13:41.188 --> 13:44.191
Soon, Mickey will be mine.

13:44.224 --> 13:45.993
(laughs)

13:46.026 --> 13:47.494
What's that?
Eh, what?

13:47.527 --> 13:49.696
No, uh, this Finger Lakes,
it's good.

13:49.729 --> 13:51.865
It's good. Yeah.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.566
Mm-hmm.

14:00.773 --> 14:03.176
Come on, tie,
you bastard.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.744
(Mickey laughs)
It's not funny.

14:04.777 --> 14:06.179
Come here.
No.

14:06.213 --> 14:09.216
Let me help.
(panting)

14:09.249 --> 14:11.584
Don't screw it up.
Just suck your neck in
a little bit.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.220
You can't suck a neck in, Mick.
Okay!

14:13.253 --> 14:15.488
Maybe lay off the salt
for a couple days, you know?

14:15.522 --> 14:17.524
Have a little water.
I hate water.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.626
I know you hate water.
There we go.

14:22.395 --> 14:23.997
Yeah? It look good?

14:24.031 --> 14:25.698
Yeah, you look good.

14:25.732 --> 14:27.700
Is this weird?

14:27.734 --> 14:29.669
Wearing Trish's
ex-husband's suit

14:29.702 --> 14:31.538
to his own wedding--
I mean, yeah.

14:31.571 --> 14:34.074
No, like, going to
this thing with Trish.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.209
Why would that be weird?

14:36.243 --> 14:37.610
You know.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.612
Come on, this is...

14:40.813 --> 14:42.649
ALBA:
Jimmy?

14:43.984 --> 14:46.119
(laughs):
Wow.

14:46.153 --> 14:48.521
You look handsome
for you.

14:48.555 --> 14:51.091
Oh. You better get going,
'cause you know what they say.

14:51.124 --> 14:52.926
If you are late
to a wedding,

14:52.960 --> 14:55.562
then you will be early
to your funeral.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.730
Do people say that?
No one's ever said that, ever.

14:57.764 --> 14:59.199
No, they say it.
No. That's never been said.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.934
But she's right.
You should go.

15:01.969 --> 15:04.604
Okay, fine. I'm gonna...

15:06.173 --> 15:08.775
(door opens, closes)

15:08.808 --> 15:10.110
Whoa.
(laughs)

15:10.143 --> 15:11.811
Finally, right?

15:11.844 --> 15:13.113
Oh, you want to watch
The Finger Lakes?

15:13.146 --> 15:14.747
No, you know what?
Screw Finger Lakes.

15:14.781 --> 15:15.915
Okay.
We're going out.

15:15.949 --> 15:16.984
(laughs)

15:17.017 --> 15:19.019
Okay. Yeah.
Yeah.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.827
The stage is set.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.262
McGregor versus Mayweather.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.663
Trump versus Clinton.

15:30.697 --> 15:33.066
Tom Brady versus
the whole frickin' world.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.702
But now for
the ultimate showdown...

15:37.270 --> 15:39.906
...Chip versus squirrel.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.109
Come on.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.477
Show yourself, squirrel.

15:47.480 --> 15:48.515
(screaming)

15:59.526 --> 16:01.628
(panting)

16:03.030 --> 16:05.365
Don't just sit there,
do something!

16:06.833 --> 16:09.869
*

16:09.902 --> 16:11.671
Mm.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.206
Excuse me, ladies...

16:13.240 --> 16:15.308
Nope. We're closed. Take your
business somewhere else.

16:15.342 --> 16:17.310
Not interested, guy.
Doing a ladies' thing.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.112
No boys allowed.
Uh, no, no, no, no.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.348
I'm the manager. I just need you
guys to take it down a notch.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.350
And please,
watch your language.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.951
Uh, some people
are complaining.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.387
Uh, maybe crank the music up.
Problem solved.

16:27.420 --> 16:28.655
Boom, did your job for you.
(laughs)

16:28.688 --> 16:29.956
Anything else I can do?

16:29.989 --> 16:31.558
It's not that kind of place.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.060
And this is not a dance floor.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.627
Okay. You know what?
I'm gonna take a break.

16:34.661 --> 16:35.895
'Cause my feet are
starting to cramp up.

16:35.928 --> 16:37.197
And that's the only reason

16:37.230 --> 16:38.498
why I'm taking a break.
Yeah.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.467
(laughs)

16:40.500 --> 16:42.335
Isn't this place the best?

16:42.369 --> 16:43.536
It's good, huh?

16:43.570 --> 16:46.005
There's just nobody here.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.840
No, no, but that's what makes it
so great. You know?

16:47.874 --> 16:49.642
We've streamlined the operation.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.512
From now on, just you and me.

16:52.545 --> 16:53.846
"From now on"?

16:53.880 --> 16:55.082
What do you--
(laughs)

16:55.115 --> 16:56.249
What do you mean?

16:56.283 --> 16:58.685
You know, three's a crowd.

16:58.718 --> 17:02.889
Jimmy's nice and all, but you're
not supposed to be with him.

17:02.922 --> 17:05.325
You're supposed
to be with me. (chuckles)

17:05.358 --> 17:07.560
Oh.
(chuckles)

17:07.594 --> 17:10.497
Uh... I-I don't mean to...
I just...

17:10.530 --> 17:11.731
Did you think I...

17:11.764 --> 17:14.267
No, no offense. I like you
very much, as a friend.

17:14.301 --> 17:15.668
No-- no, I didn't mean that.
I don't know, but...

17:15.702 --> 17:18.004
I was just... No, no, no!
I've made a mistake.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.373
That's becoming clear to me now.
But I wasn't-- oh!

17:20.407 --> 17:22.242
I just got to pop
by that wedding real quick.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.211
It's all good.
Hey, you'll be fine.
I-- no, Mickey.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.445
Drink some water. Can we get
some waters over here?

17:25.478 --> 17:26.679
No, no.
Yeah, I-I'll be,

17:26.713 --> 17:27.847
I'll be back in a few hours.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.016
No. Mickey, wait, don't go!

17:30.049 --> 17:32.719
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

17:32.752 --> 17:34.254
to join this man
and this woman...

17:34.287 --> 17:36.256
I can't believe he's marrying
someone older than me.

17:36.289 --> 17:37.757
What a kick in the cooch.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.426
Nah.

17:39.459 --> 17:42.629
Without makeup, you look
just as old as she does.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.631
(chuckling):
That's...

17:44.664 --> 17:46.566
Thanks for coming.

17:46.599 --> 17:47.967
If anyone has any objections

17:48.000 --> 17:49.936
as to why this couple
should not wed,

17:49.969 --> 17:53.039
speak now or forever
hold your peace.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.774
Wait!

17:54.807 --> 17:56.609
Wait!

17:56.643 --> 17:57.910
Mick?
Wait!

17:59.479 --> 18:01.080
Oh!
(people gasping)

18:01.114 --> 18:03.216
(laughs softly)
Hi.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.385
Whoops. Hi, there. All good.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.320
Thank you. Hi,
everybody. Sorry.

18:07.354 --> 18:08.621
That was unexpected.

18:08.655 --> 18:09.889
No, no, nobody panic, okay?

18:09.922 --> 18:11.090
I'm not here

18:11.124 --> 18:13.059
to-to object to
this wedding.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.662
But you two, I object to you.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.564
Okay, Mickey, can I...
Jimmy, just let--
just shut up.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.233
No, but you have...
Just shut up and let me
talk for a second, okay?

18:20.267 --> 18:22.335
Trish, I really like you.

18:22.369 --> 18:24.437
But this, I just can't
be okay with this.

18:24.471 --> 18:27.574
I don't know why it bothers me,
it just does.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.442
Okay.
I just feel like...

18:29.476 --> 18:32.445
(stammers) He's like, you--
he's like my dog.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.814
You know what I mean?
And when somebody

18:34.847 --> 18:37.417
pets my dog, I don't like it.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.118
I don't like it!

18:39.152 --> 18:41.154
I'm just trying to
he-- tell you here

18:41.188 --> 18:44.491
that I am having feelings.
I think they're feelings.
Okay, Mick...

18:44.524 --> 18:46.526
I don't quite understand
what they are. I feel...

18:46.559 --> 18:48.961
I feel weird,
if I'm being totally honest.
Stop. Okay. Okay.

18:48.995 --> 18:50.330
I feel a little bit weird.

18:50.363 --> 18:51.631
ALBA:
No, Mickey, don't!

18:51.664 --> 18:53.300
(people gasping, screaming)

18:53.333 --> 18:54.834
(screams)
(Alba crashes)

18:54.867 --> 18:56.102
Alba?

18:56.135 --> 18:57.970
(Alba shouting)

18:58.004 --> 18:59.606
(grunting)

18:59.639 --> 19:01.608
MAN:
Are you all right?
I-I, no, I'm good.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.109
You okay?
Don't worry.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.278
I-- no, it's okay.
Are you...
I don't know...

19:05.312 --> 19:07.447
I don't know what
she's doing, but I...
You guys look nice.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.781
If I'm being honest,
I feel like this church

19:08.815 --> 19:10.550
is a little off-kilter.
What-- Mickey.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.118
What is that? What?

19:12.151 --> 19:13.353
Am I right?
No, no, don't pull!

19:13.386 --> 19:14.621
Oh!
Mickey!

19:14.654 --> 19:15.855
(people screaming)

19:15.888 --> 19:17.156
Mickey, no!
Get off!

19:17.190 --> 19:18.791
Stop. I just...

19:18.825 --> 19:20.159
Mickey, no!

19:20.193 --> 19:21.861
Oh, no.
Mickey, are you...?

19:21.894 --> 19:23.463
Is that mine?
Yeah.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.697
Is that real?
Yeah.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.132
Oh, I screwed up.
That's not good.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.335
It's okay. No, I got you.
Oh...

19:33.172 --> 19:35.575
Hey, bud.
How you feeling?

19:35.608 --> 19:37.244
Like you care.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.845
We do care.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.214
Yeah, right. I thought you guys
frickin' hated me.

19:41.248 --> 19:42.249
Oh, come on, Chip,
you're our brother.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.350
We don't hate you.

19:43.383 --> 19:44.651
We love you.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.152
BEN: Yeah, I'd
be pretty sad

19:46.185 --> 19:49.155
if you got killed by a squirrel.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.891
Thanks, guys. That means a lot.
SABRINA: Yeah,

19:51.924 --> 19:53.360
and I'm sure this annoying
stuff is just a phase.

19:53.393 --> 19:54.927
You know, you'll
probably grow out of it.

19:54.961 --> 19:56.763
I guess you're right.

19:56.796 --> 19:59.766
Besides, I mean, it's not like
you've always been cool.

19:59.799 --> 20:00.900
Remember when you were
friends with that guy

20:00.933 --> 20:03.370
who turned out to be
a huge drug dealer?

20:03.403 --> 20:05.905
That was very cool.

20:05.938 --> 20:08.775
Okay, well, do you remember when
you were in the seventh grade

20:08.808 --> 20:10.743
and dating that senior? Ha.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.745
Probably the coolest thing
I've ever done.

20:14.146 --> 20:16.182
Well, look, the doctor said
you might have rabies.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.884
That's pretty rad.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.186
I guess that is pretty sick.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.188
I'm like frickin' Old Yeller.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.323
(howls)

20:27.159 --> 20:29.629
All right, we're gonna
go get some food.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.431
Bye, Chip. Hope you feel better.

20:31.464 --> 20:32.565
Hey, guys?

20:34.066 --> 20:35.134
I love you, too.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.710
Why are you staring at me
like that?

20:43.743 --> 20:45.645
Because you love me.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.447
I had a shard of glass
stuck in my jugular.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.815
I can't be responsible
for anything I said.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.216
It's okay.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.884
'Cause I love you enough
for both of us.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.252
Eh.

20:53.286 --> 20:54.821
You called me your dog.
Stop. I hate myself.

20:54.854 --> 20:57.256
Special delivery.

20:57.290 --> 20:59.959
Alba...
You got me flowers, Alba?
You didn't have to do that.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.127
Well, I-I wanted to.
(chuckles)

21:01.160 --> 21:02.295
And a card, too?

21:02.329 --> 21:03.563
Oh, no, that's a-a...
Ah.

21:03.596 --> 21:06.599
"Best wedding ever.
Love, Trish."

21:06.633 --> 21:09.235
Ugh.
I-- you know, I
brought them inside.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.003
I mean, this woman.
It wasn't enough

21:11.037 --> 21:13.340
that she saved my life
and gave me her blood.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.741
Hey, I gave you my blood.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.776
Your blood was unusable.

21:16.809 --> 21:19.946
Doctor said you had enough Molly
in your system to kill a moose.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.649
Why, doctors are dramatic. Uh,
you've seen The Finger Lakes.

21:22.682 --> 21:24.684
Trish's blood, top shelf.
Huh.

21:24.717 --> 21:26.953
I can feel it just
coursing through my veins.

21:26.986 --> 21:29.188
Well, why don't you just cut
her open and live inside her?

21:29.221 --> 21:31.123
(scoffs)
Sounds nice.

21:31.157 --> 21:32.959
Oh!
Ho!

21:32.992 --> 21:34.160
Power's on.

21:34.193 --> 21:35.862
Eh, not bad, right?

21:35.895 --> 21:37.196
Yeah.

21:37.229 --> 21:39.165
You did good, Jimmy.

21:39.198 --> 21:41.368
Can I ask you something?

21:41.401 --> 21:42.469
Yeah.

21:42.502 --> 21:43.603
(farts)

21:43.636 --> 21:44.804
Who farted in my pants?

21:44.837 --> 21:46.539
Oh, come on. Ugh!

21:46.573 --> 21:47.774
Get out of here!

21:47.807 --> 21:51.177
Who did that?
Just, oh, my...

21:53.546 --> 21:55.014

My nips are mad frickin' hard.

enjoyed
kickin' it
