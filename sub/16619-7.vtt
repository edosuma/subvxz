WEBVTT

00:01.072 --> 00:03.320
- Previously on "Quantico"...
- This is a nightmare.

00:03.344 --> 00:05.081
You wake up from nightmares.

00:05.087 --> 00:06.467
Do I belong here?

00:06.492 --> 00:08.117
I was the one who recruited you here.

00:08.122 --> 00:10.220
I believe you may be special.

00:10.226 --> 00:13.889
What if I talked to Miranda
about you going undercover?

00:13.914 --> 00:15.624
I don't want to be that monster.

00:15.630 --> 00:16.381
You're not.

00:16.406 --> 00:18.594
Do you think we'd do better if
it was just one of us here?

00:18.600 --> 00:19.428
Do you?

00:19.434 --> 00:21.597
Harry, once and for all, I'm not gay.

00:21.603 --> 00:23.636
No! No!

00:25.540 --> 00:27.603
But the next time I see you,
I will kill you.

00:30.879 --> 00:32.708
You got to be pragmatic

00:32.714 --> 00:34.943
about how you save the most
people with minimal casualties.

00:34.949 --> 00:37.246
And over 1,600 people got out.

00:37.252 --> 00:39.647
What about the millions in New York City

00:39.653 --> 00:41.387
who are facing the possible threat

00:41.412 --> 00:43.408
of some kind of biological weapon?

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

01:01.075 --> 01:02.737
God!

01:38.145 --> 01:39.974
Getting hard to breathe in here?

01:39.980 --> 01:41.875
I'm not letting air in.

01:41.881 --> 01:43.110
I'm getting me out.

01:43.116 --> 01:44.702
Well, what's the hurry, Jane?

01:44.727 --> 01:47.690
Oh, I'm sorry. Did you not get enough?

01:47.696 --> 01:51.060
Well, it's not that I don't
like seeing you in my car,

01:51.066 --> 01:53.396
or the motel, or the alley, but...

01:53.402 --> 01:54.897
You inviting me back to your place?

01:54.903 --> 01:56.466
We talked about that. You know I can't.

01:56.472 --> 01:59.836
Then I guess there's
nothing left to discuss.

01:59.842 --> 02:01.308
See you later.

02:03.179 --> 02:05.708
Maybe.

02:10.565 --> 02:12.481
You ran here? It's eight miles.

02:12.487 --> 02:14.350
Yeah, I just needed some alone time.

02:14.356 --> 02:16.152
You're buttoned all weird.

02:16.158 --> 02:18.054
So, what exactly do you want me to do?

02:18.060 --> 02:19.588
Wait, are we late?

02:19.594 --> 02:22.195
No. We're actually early.

02:25.367 --> 02:28.230
We were just going through
some operational details

02:28.236 --> 02:29.732
relevant to Ryan's mission.

02:29.738 --> 02:31.000
Ryan's mission?

02:31.006 --> 02:32.268
All right, since we're all here,

02:32.274 --> 02:33.536
let's get to the heart of it, shall we?

02:33.542 --> 02:35.104
Our expectation has been

02:35.110 --> 02:38.174
that the AIC would move
with precision and economy

02:38.180 --> 02:40.376
when choosing its players,
but after six weeks,

02:40.382 --> 02:42.778
we're no further along than
we were when we first started,

02:42.784 --> 02:43.812
and we have no leads.

02:43.818 --> 02:46.048
You're a third of the way
through your training,

02:46.054 --> 02:47.550
and not only have you
failed to get tapped,

02:47.556 --> 02:49.451
you more than likely
missed who did get tapped

02:49.457 --> 02:51.119
right in front of you.

02:51.125 --> 02:54.022
Our only choice now is
to reach the source.

02:54.028 --> 02:55.724
Owen Hall?

02:55.730 --> 02:57.726
If you think the AIC's impenetrable,

02:57.732 --> 02:59.528
he's Fort Knox.

02:59.534 --> 03:01.630
Then you have to break in.

03:01.636 --> 03:02.917
A gift from Langley,

03:02.942 --> 03:04.733
and a private contractor The Farm hired

03:04.739 --> 03:07.236
to freshen up the houses last year.

03:07.242 --> 03:08.870
A false wall.

03:08.876 --> 03:10.138
In a private home

03:10.144 --> 03:12.073
on a government military reservation

03:12.079 --> 03:14.108
in the most secure
neighborhood in the country.

03:14.114 --> 03:15.276
Whatever's behind that wall

03:15.282 --> 03:18.213
is very important to Owen.

03:18.219 --> 03:19.814
And you have to find out what it is.

03:19.820 --> 03:21.148
Well, there might be a way through Lydia.

03:21.154 --> 03:22.149
Owen's opening up to me.

03:22.155 --> 03:22.907
I could use it.

03:22.932 --> 03:24.452
But you just said he's Fort Knox.

03:24.458 --> 03:26.254
And you said go straight to the source.

03:26.260 --> 03:27.822
That's what Alex is proposing.

03:27.828 --> 03:30.091
All right.

03:30.097 --> 03:31.108
Nimah, Ryan.

03:33.772 --> 03:37.265
Alex, I don't just want
results this time.

03:37.271 --> 03:39.300
I need results.

03:39.306 --> 03:40.372
You got it.

03:46.346 --> 03:48.308
An operations meeting,
and we're on the outside?

03:48.314 --> 03:49.643
Don't read too much into it.

03:49.649 --> 03:50.858
I'd be blind not to.

03:50.883 --> 03:52.679
No one said anything to me.

03:52.685 --> 03:54.615
I'll talk with Miranda about it.

03:54.621 --> 03:55.850
Right now, you just need to focus

03:55.856 --> 03:57.484
on getting into Owen's house.

03:57.490 --> 04:00.187
I know that you're
the best agent for this mission.

04:00.193 --> 04:01.288
Remind them.

04:04.765 --> 04:05.860
Bullseye!

04:05.866 --> 04:06.927
No, you're half an inch off.

04:06.933 --> 04:08.195
Oh, the hell it is! Look.

04:08.201 --> 04:08.963
Okay, new game.

04:08.969 --> 04:10.597
You have to hit it dead center,

04:10.603 --> 04:12.298
and every time you don't,
you have to answer

04:12.304 --> 04:14.333
a highly personal,
deeply embarrassing question.

04:14.339 --> 04:15.301
Preferably both.

04:15.307 --> 04:16.101
- No.
- Nah.

04:16.108 --> 04:17.837
No? Well, let's just mainline pints

04:17.843 --> 04:20.206
and play 1 to 20 like
total wankers, then.

04:20.212 --> 04:21.207
Huh? Come on.

04:21.213 --> 04:25.879
The SAS says "Who dares
wins," so who dares?

04:25.885 --> 04:27.313
I want to win.

04:27.319 --> 04:29.115
So impressed with you right now.

04:29.121 --> 04:30.921
Aww, thanks, Harry.

04:33.225 --> 04:34.254
- Ohh.
- Ooh.

04:34.260 --> 04:36.890
Why don't you ever talk
about where you're from?

04:36.896 --> 04:40.293
I was born outside Harare.

04:40.299 --> 04:42.495
But I don't consider that
a part of my life.

04:42.501 --> 04:45.001
I was adopted when I was 9.

04:46.337 --> 04:47.732
And your birth family... Where are they?

04:47.738 --> 04:49.605
No idea.

04:52.376 --> 04:53.738
- Nice!
- Whoo!

04:53.744 --> 04:56.341
Of course the fancy
lawyer's good at darts.

04:56.347 --> 04:57.709
No one gets dirty playing darts.

04:57.715 --> 04:58.748
Funny.

05:01.209 --> 05:02.614
Oh.

05:02.620 --> 05:05.217
Ah, if only you were getting more
sleep in your own bed lately.

05:05.223 --> 05:07.385
Is that your question?

05:07.391 --> 05:09.387
Because the answer is
yes, I made a friend.

05:09.393 --> 05:10.565
You jealous?

05:13.731 --> 05:15.259
Parrish!

05:15.265 --> 05:16.660
Go, Alex!

05:16.666 --> 05:18.762
- Parrish!
- Alex, Alex!

05:18.768 --> 05:20.501
Okay.

05:21.338 --> 05:22.399
- Ohh.
- Yes!

05:22.405 --> 05:25.703
At any point in your prior service,

05:25.709 --> 05:29.406
were there any, uh,
Booth-on-Parrish extracurriculars

05:29.412 --> 05:30.407
at the FBI?

05:30.413 --> 05:31.442
Absolutely not.

05:31.448 --> 05:32.543
Oh, come on, Alex.

05:32.549 --> 05:34.349
Truthful answers, remember?

05:37.187 --> 05:38.349
You know what?

05:38.355 --> 05:41.418
Even if it did, I guess it
just wasn't that memorable.

05:41.424 --> 05:42.657
Ooh.

05:43.710 --> 05:45.526
- Ooh.
- Wow.

05:48.264 --> 05:50.026
I was hoping you'd be bad at this.

05:50.032 --> 05:53.363
An audience with the Pope...
Who could resist that?

05:53.369 --> 05:54.097
The Pope?

05:54.103 --> 05:55.169
Yeah, the Pope.

05:58.407 --> 05:59.336
Oh, Harry.

05:59.342 --> 06:01.972
Your friend who died...
What was his name?

06:01.978 --> 06:02.839
Well, you're gonna have to be

06:02.845 --> 06:04.574
a bit more specific than that, mate.

06:04.580 --> 06:05.641
You know who I'm talking about.

06:05.647 --> 06:07.310
Mm. All right.

06:07.316 --> 06:08.811
Well, I'm gonna grab another drink.
Who wants one?

06:08.817 --> 06:09.880
- Yes.
- Yep.

06:09.886 --> 06:12.782
Is he someone we can even,
uh, verify having existed?

06:12.788 --> 06:15.886
Well, there goes our fun-spirited,
team-building game.

06:15.892 --> 06:17.557
Yeah, his name was Elliot.

06:19.996 --> 06:21.124
What'd he do for a living?

06:21.130 --> 06:23.597
Uh, he didn't.

06:27.403 --> 06:28.765
Did you love him?

06:31.843 --> 06:32.968
Yeah, of course.

06:32.974 --> 06:34.240
He love you back?

06:38.079 --> 06:39.942
There's my answer.

06:39.948 --> 06:41.778
How'd he do it?

06:41.784 --> 06:43.446
You said it was messy.

06:43.452 --> 06:46.081
Oh, maybe a gun?

06:46.087 --> 06:47.116
Razor?

06:47.122 --> 06:48.451
Or was he a jumper?

06:48.457 --> 06:49.690
Easy, Sebastian.

06:49.715 --> 06:50.986
I get to ask the questions, don't I?

06:50.992 --> 06:53.088
Yeah, but you're not asking,
are you, Sebastian?

06:53.094 --> 06:54.356
You're pushing.

06:54.362 --> 06:57.430
Hey, cool it. El jefe's here.

07:04.940 --> 07:07.202
Hey, don't let my need for a burger

07:07.208 --> 07:08.203
disrupt your fun.

07:08.209 --> 07:09.405
Well, if you want
to join us for a few drinks,

07:09.411 --> 07:12.374
Harry's managed to turn darts
into an elicitation exercise.

07:12.380 --> 07:14.713
Nothing to elicit out of me.

07:15.984 --> 07:18.180
See you tomorrow, Booth.

07:20.788 --> 07:22.318
I said I'd take Owen.

07:22.324 --> 07:24.453
I know. I was just here.

07:24.459 --> 07:25.654
And I was just there.

07:25.660 --> 07:27.689
You could've waited for me.

07:27.695 --> 07:28.557
Or is there something I missed

07:28.563 --> 07:30.358
in this meeting that started without me?

07:30.364 --> 07:32.087
Don't be paranoid, okay?

07:32.112 --> 07:33.561
Then leave Owen to me.

07:33.567 --> 07:36.497
Both of us showing an interest in him,
he's gonna notice.

07:36.503 --> 07:38.666
And if he notices...

07:38.672 --> 07:42.536
You said you wanted
to elicit something from me.

07:42.542 --> 07:43.972
What?!

07:43.978 --> 07:45.139
Just to join our game.

07:45.145 --> 07:46.511
What were you wanting from me?

07:47.647 --> 07:48.676
I saw you at the bar.

07:48.701 --> 07:50.230
- I thought you might want to join us.
- No, no.

07:50.236 --> 07:52.580
That's exactly what you've
said every time I asked.

07:52.586 --> 07:55.549
See, someone telling the truth
is gonna vary their responses,

07:55.555 --> 07:58.752
but a liar is gonna feed you
the same line over and over

07:58.758 --> 07:59.852
because they're hiding something.

07:59.876 --> 08:01.522
So tell me one more time, Booth,

08:01.528 --> 08:03.362
what were you after?

08:05.599 --> 08:06.867
All right, good. Right there.

08:06.892 --> 08:08.884
See that?

08:08.909 --> 08:13.534
One light, one chair, three minutes.

08:13.540 --> 08:14.768
What did Ryan give up?

08:14.774 --> 08:18.071
Physical information... His stressors.

08:18.077 --> 08:21.408
Tactical information...
What he was and wasn't saying.

08:21.414 --> 08:24.945
But sometimes you need to go further...

08:24.951 --> 08:26.199
Much further.

08:26.224 --> 08:28.181
Enhanced interrogation techniques

08:28.187 --> 08:30.551
will also be used on you
if you're ever caught,

08:30.557 --> 08:32.520
so today we're going to teach you

08:32.525 --> 08:36.356
how to survive, evade, and resist them.

08:36.361 --> 08:37.491
These techniques are designed

08:37.496 --> 08:40.027
to push you to the physical,
mental, and emotional brink,

08:40.033 --> 08:42.629
because that's where
you will often find the truth.

08:42.635 --> 08:45.098
And when it comes to
gaining critical intelligence,

08:45.104 --> 08:48.339
there's no such thing as going too far.

09:09.462 --> 09:10.909
Hello?

09:10.934 --> 09:12.276
Shelby, it's Alex.

09:12.301 --> 09:13.459
Oh, thank God you're alive.

09:13.465 --> 09:14.226
Where are you?

09:14.232 --> 09:15.127
I don't have much time, okay?

09:15.133 --> 09:16.796
The terrorists have been communicating

09:16.802 --> 09:18.164
with someone from the outside.

09:18.170 --> 09:20.299
If you find out who, you can stop this.

09:20.305 --> 09:22.468
Run this number... 626-555...

09:24.142 --> 09:25.504
Hello?

09:32.117 --> 09:33.079
There.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.173
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

10:01.395 --> 10:03.328
Who are you?

10:04.325 --> 10:06.527
Look, they... they keep
asking me about drives.

10:06.533 --> 10:08.429
They say you have them.

10:08.435 --> 10:11.199
Hey, can you hear me?

10:11.205 --> 10:13.450
Are... are you okay? Did they hurt you?

10:15.409 --> 10:16.404
What's your name?

10:16.410 --> 10:18.206
Mike.

10:18.212 --> 10:19.440
Where you from, Mike?

10:19.446 --> 10:22.744
P-Pensacola originally.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.779
I-I'm an attaché

10:24.785 --> 10:27.281
for a global-development
fund based in D.C.

10:27.287 --> 10:28.982
And how long have you been doing that?

10:28.988 --> 10:30.551
Why are you asking me these questions?

10:30.557 --> 10:33.487
Because I don't believe a
word of what you're saying.

10:33.493 --> 10:34.589
Why would I lie?!

10:34.595 --> 10:36.457
'Cause you're one of them.

10:36.463 --> 10:41.295
You're trying to manipulate me,
appeal to my empathy.

10:41.301 --> 10:42.430
I'm just doing what they asked.

10:42.436 --> 10:43.431
They said they'd kill me if...

10:43.437 --> 10:46.400
That right there...
That's called tradecraft.

10:46.406 --> 10:50.404
You're getting nothing out of me.

10:50.410 --> 10:53.307
Now you tell me, Mike.

10:53.313 --> 10:54.808
Am I telling you the truth?

10:56.816 --> 10:59.413
Finding an opening for anything
other than the physical

10:59.419 --> 11:00.314
has been difficult.

11:00.320 --> 11:01.349
Of course.

11:01.355 --> 11:03.683
You're meeting him in cars,
bars, and motels.

11:03.689 --> 11:05.986
You made yourself slightly
more dimensional

11:05.992 --> 11:07.020
than an online profile.

11:07.026 --> 11:09.582
It's not like I can take
him back to my apartment.

11:09.607 --> 11:11.859
Which is why you have to develop a cover

11:11.865 --> 11:14.327
if you're going to get any
usable information from him.

11:14.333 --> 11:15.062
I have a cover.

11:15.068 --> 11:16.864
You have a name, not a life.

11:16.870 --> 11:18.632
You need an apartment he can go to,

11:18.638 --> 11:21.468
friends he can meet,
trust he can establish

11:21.474 --> 11:24.755
so when he does start to talk,
he feels safe.

11:24.780 --> 11:29.042
So I am supposed to create
and cultivate a parallel life

11:29.048 --> 11:30.778
and run Alex?

11:30.784 --> 11:32.479
Miranda already thinks
we've fallen behind.

11:32.485 --> 11:34.882
Not if I suggest to her
that your work with León

11:34.888 --> 11:37.216
becomes an official part
of the operation.

11:37.222 --> 11:39.185
Well, I couldn't be Alex's handler, then.

11:39.191 --> 11:40.219
I'd be in the game.

11:41.393 --> 11:43.489
Hey, I know that she is struggling,

11:43.495 --> 11:46.058
but it's my job to get
her through the mission.

11:46.064 --> 11:48.294
But you have a real connection

11:48.300 --> 11:51.463
with the one CIA recruit
who is an actual ex-felon.

11:51.469 --> 11:54.801
Don't you think that's what
the AIC would be looking for?

11:54.807 --> 11:58.237
Next time he contacts you,
if you engage with him,

11:58.243 --> 11:59.906
it means you're all in.

11:59.912 --> 12:02.074
No more Shelby Wyatt.

12:02.080 --> 12:05.044
You become Jane Foster,
and I become your handler.

12:05.050 --> 12:07.680
Otherwise, do not respond to him.

12:07.686 --> 12:09.648
If you keep up the bars,
motels, and cars,

12:09.654 --> 12:11.150
I'm gonna have to report you

12:11.156 --> 12:13.385
for interfering with the investigation.

12:13.391 --> 12:14.753
I care about Alex.

12:14.759 --> 12:16.488
You know that I do.

12:16.494 --> 12:19.157
You're just one step closer than her,

12:19.163 --> 12:21.130
and you're our better bet.

12:22.380 --> 12:24.596
The human will to resist

12:24.602 --> 12:26.432
is the most durable and complicated safe

12:26.438 --> 12:28.200
you could ever want to crack.

12:28.206 --> 12:29.368
Just as world-class bank robbers

12:29.374 --> 12:33.171
use drills, torches, and even
dynamite when necessary,

12:33.177 --> 12:34.573
enhanced interrogation techniques

12:34.579 --> 12:37.275
can be your tool to break
the truth out of someone,

12:37.281 --> 12:39.110
or have them broken out of you.

12:39.116 --> 12:41.847
We will take you to
the brink to see whether or not

12:41.853 --> 12:46.218
you'll give up your secrets,
your country, or yourself.

12:46.224 --> 12:48.019
This is no mere brutality.

12:48.025 --> 12:50.555
At one time, this agency's
no-holds-barred approach

12:50.561 --> 12:52.523
took this country down a very dark road

12:52.529 --> 12:54.692
to waterboarding, physical torture,

12:54.698 --> 12:56.862
and human-rights violations.

12:56.868 --> 13:01.266
But there's still room to
play the edge and win...

13:01.272 --> 13:02.868
Which is what we'll learn today.

13:02.874 --> 13:04.874
If you can handle it.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.373
Loud music played for hours

13:08.379 --> 13:09.975
can disorient a subject

13:09.981 --> 13:11.542
and create a sense of hopelessness

13:11.548 --> 13:13.478
that'll make a subject
more likely to talk.

13:13.484 --> 13:16.054
You think this is torture?

13:16.079 --> 13:19.650
Eh, clearly you haven't
been to a Coldplay concert.

13:27.230 --> 13:28.925
Sensory deprivation.

13:28.950 --> 13:30.795
The feeling of being cut
off from one's self

13:30.801 --> 13:33.398
can instill a sense of fear in a subject.

13:33.404 --> 13:34.532
It can drive them to break.

13:34.538 --> 13:38.770
Did they teach you this
type of thing at Quantico?

13:38.776 --> 13:40.337
No.

13:40.343 --> 13:43.107
I only got to experience
it in the real world.

13:43.113 --> 13:47.311
Extreme temperatures can
push someone to the brink,

13:47.317 --> 13:48.417
then past it.

13:50.253 --> 13:52.983
Forced stress positions can
cause as much mental pain

13:52.989 --> 13:54.655
as they do physical pain.

13:54.680 --> 13:57.321
I bet you wish you'd
gotten the music, huh?

13:57.327 --> 13:58.989
I'm fine.

13:58.995 --> 14:00.257
And endurance exercises

14:00.263 --> 14:02.326
can unravel even the strongest psyche.

14:03.666 --> 14:06.696
I knew you'd rise to the occasion.

14:06.702 --> 14:08.032
The pain will fade.

14:08.038 --> 14:10.767
You know what'll help it fade quicker?

14:10.773 --> 14:14.504
Is that 18-year-old Talisker
I saw in your liquor cabinet.

14:14.510 --> 14:17.441
You know I do live next door, right?

14:20.783 --> 14:23.113
I might have taken a shine
to you as a recruit here,

14:23.119 --> 14:25.482
but I'm... I'm sorry if I let you believe

14:25.488 --> 14:26.954
it was anything more than that.

14:32.562 --> 14:34.458
Now you have just an inkling

14:34.464 --> 14:36.827
of what it is to hit
your own breaking points.

14:36.833 --> 14:38.061
Keep that in mind

14:38.067 --> 14:41.788
when you use the same techniques
on a live subject tomorrow.

14:41.813 --> 14:43.066
I'm offering you a chance

14:43.072 --> 14:46.336
to try to break the
toughest person on The Farm.

14:46.342 --> 14:48.141
Me.

14:48.166 --> 14:49.405
Can you get my secret...

14:49.411 --> 14:52.642
The alias I cultivated while operational,

14:52.648 --> 14:56.045
a name which leads to where the
agency buried some of its bodies

14:56.051 --> 14:57.747
when I held the shovel.

14:57.753 --> 15:00.350
Or, at least my alias did.

15:00.356 --> 15:02.551
Enticing enough for you?

15:02.557 --> 15:07.171
This scenario does not
end until you break me.

15:07.196 --> 15:09.492
You don't get my alias,
you don't get off The Farm.

15:09.498 --> 15:10.763
I don't care how long it takes.

15:10.788 --> 15:13.533
There's no around, only through.

15:14.374 --> 15:15.764
Please!

15:16.905 --> 15:18.266
I have a daughter.

15:18.272 --> 15:20.068
Lucy. She's 9 years old.

15:20.074 --> 15:23.672
They just want to know about the drives.

15:23.678 --> 15:25.240
Please don't let me die in here.

15:25.246 --> 15:27.676
Don't let me miss the rest
of my daughter's life.

15:27.682 --> 15:29.945
Please, you have to believe me.

15:29.951 --> 15:31.346
I can't help you.

15:31.352 --> 15:33.081
But you believe me?

15:33.087 --> 15:35.250
You do. You should. I'm not one of them.

15:36.457 --> 15:39.054
I talked to her like you asked.

15:39.060 --> 15:40.688
She doesn't know anything.

15:41.695 --> 15:43.291
Oh, my God.

15:43.297 --> 15:44.759
No, no, please.

15:44.765 --> 15:46.430
I-I-I tried.

15:46.455 --> 15:47.595
It's not my fault!

15:47.601 --> 15:48.897
That's not gonna work.

15:48.903 --> 15:50.798
Tell them what they want to know!

15:50.804 --> 15:51.466
Okay.

15:51.472 --> 15:52.734
Mike... Mike, look at me.

15:52.740 --> 15:53.535
Look at me!

15:53.541 --> 15:54.875
I'm right here, okay?

15:54.900 --> 15:57.472
They're doing this just
to scare us, okay?

15:57.478 --> 15:58.773
They may hurt us,

15:58.779 --> 16:00.542
but they're never gonna kill us,

16:00.548 --> 16:01.609
because this is all just...

16:05.053 --> 16:06.814
Where are the drives?

16:06.820 --> 16:08.816
Get your hands off me!

16:08.822 --> 16:10.480
Start talking...

16:10.505 --> 16:12.219
...or we'll take our time with this one.

16:12.225 --> 16:13.220
Alex?

16:13.226 --> 16:14.363
Dayana.

16:18.183 --> 16:19.280
Ramsey!

16:20.919 --> 16:22.681
Everyone's moving at breakneck speed.

16:22.687 --> 16:24.039
I'd like to know what they're chasing.

16:24.063 --> 16:26.108
Wyatt got a phone call
from inside the crisis...

16:26.133 --> 16:27.131
Alex Parrish.

16:27.156 --> 16:28.619
She says the terrorists are communicating

16:28.625 --> 16:29.753
with someone on the outside.

16:29.759 --> 16:31.755
That's incredible. Do they know who?

16:31.761 --> 16:34.391
Alex only got 6 digits
out in a string of 10.

16:34.397 --> 16:36.427
We're cracking 10,000 possible variations

16:36.433 --> 16:37.728
and checking which ones have been used

16:37.734 --> 16:39.263
since the crisis began.

16:39.269 --> 16:41.265
We'll find it and the
bastard who owns it.

17:02.826 --> 17:05.622
Feel free to go in when you want.

17:05.627 --> 17:07.790
In any configuration you want.

17:07.797 --> 17:09.827
I'm just here to make
sure you don't get hurt.

17:09.833 --> 17:11.094
How do we start?

17:11.099 --> 17:12.095
Wait him out.

17:12.101 --> 17:13.474
He's been up all night.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.398
We've deprived him of
food and water and sleep,

17:15.405 --> 17:17.734
and we turned it up to 90 degrees.

17:17.741 --> 17:18.635
Softening him up.

17:18.641 --> 17:20.838
15 hours is long enough to stew.

17:20.844 --> 17:23.574
He seems like a rational actor.

17:23.579 --> 17:27.310
Let's see if we can get
him to act rationally.

17:27.316 --> 17:30.227
I'll go first.

17:38.494 --> 17:40.790
It's balmy in here.

17:40.796 --> 17:43.659
Do you want some water?

17:43.665 --> 17:44.960
Little toilet break?

17:47.002 --> 17:49.432
Look, Owen, I really have
no idea why you're doing this,

17:49.438 --> 17:50.833
other than to prove you're a badass,

17:50.839 --> 17:52.635
but there is a fairly
logical chain of events

17:52.641 --> 17:53.436
liable to happen.

17:53.442 --> 17:55.471
Why don't you tell me what it is?

17:55.477 --> 17:57.673
Okay, well, your own
physiology will let you down,

17:57.679 --> 17:59.675
because you've been in
here for what, 15 hours,

17:59.681 --> 18:01.210
and 9 more hours awake,

18:01.216 --> 18:02.512
and you will start answering questions

18:02.518 --> 18:05.114
like you've got a 0.1
blood-alcohol level.

18:05.120 --> 18:06.382
12 more after that,

18:06.388 --> 18:07.817
and you'll lose emotional control

18:07.823 --> 18:08.981
and memory retention

18:09.006 --> 18:11.083
simply because the lights are on.

18:11.108 --> 18:13.455
Your hormonal and chemical imbalances,

18:13.461 --> 18:16.125
due to sleep deprivation,
will work to our benefit,

18:16.131 --> 18:20.362
and all of that before you
start blacking out at hour 36.

18:20.368 --> 18:22.231
Not good.

18:22.237 --> 18:27.369
But, you know, could
just skip the nonsense.

18:27.375 --> 18:29.038
Head straight to quid pro quo

18:29.044 --> 18:31.407
and all head home for
a nice, long snooze.

18:33.103 --> 18:34.410
Come on, mate.

18:34.416 --> 18:36.745
We've got a stick.

18:36.751 --> 18:38.818
I'm offering you the carrot.

18:41.022 --> 18:42.317
Making an offer only works

18:42.323 --> 18:44.185
when the subject is beaten down enough

18:44.191 --> 18:45.324
to grasp it.

18:48.562 --> 18:49.928
You wasted your shot.

18:53.334 --> 18:55.229
Told you we should've waited longer.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.664
Owen's not gonna fold

18:56.670 --> 18:58.399
because he's a little hungry and tired.

18:58.405 --> 19:00.568
Owen said this scenario's
about enhanced interrogation.

19:00.574 --> 19:01.569
That's what we should be using.

19:01.575 --> 19:02.437
Yeah, but he also said

19:02.443 --> 19:04.439
that the agency's policy on torture

19:04.445 --> 19:06.274
took this country down a dark path.

19:06.280 --> 19:07.442
There's a reason they stopped it.

19:07.448 --> 19:11.579
Who's to say that torturing
him will gain us anything?

19:11.585 --> 19:13.814
I mean, if we put him in enough pain,

19:13.820 --> 19:15.983
he might just lie to get out of it.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.718
Look, let's just wait him out, okay?

19:17.724 --> 19:19.553
Another 12 hours.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.555
Let's break his spirit, not him.

19:21.561 --> 19:24.391
He'll wait us out
before we can even bend him.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.293
I say we fight fire with fire.

19:26.299 --> 19:29.429
I say we try every tactic
on him that he tried on us.

19:29.435 --> 19:31.665
No more, no less.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.115
Good.

19:48.121 --> 19:49.683
I could use a shower.

20:26.791 --> 20:28.391
Give us the alias, Owen.

20:30.662 --> 20:32.058
- Hey!
- Someone get the door!

20:32.064 --> 20:33.225
I got him! I got him!

20:35.667 --> 20:37.729
We need to make sure
he can't move the tub again.

20:37.735 --> 20:39.169
Put a rock in it.

20:44.008 --> 20:45.442
It'll weigh it down.

20:58.522 --> 20:59.685
That's it?

20:59.691 --> 21:00.923
Come on.

21:04.361 --> 21:05.857
Oh, no. We shouldn't be doing this.

21:05.863 --> 21:07.726
You know, we shouldn't be doing this.

21:07.732 --> 21:09.699
They're operating within the parameters.

21:16.841 --> 21:19.738
How'd you learn to do that?

21:19.744 --> 21:21.707
You done this before?

21:28.165 --> 21:29.380
Who was he?

21:29.386 --> 21:31.516
An interrogation tool.

21:31.522 --> 21:34.018
What do they want?

21:34.024 --> 21:36.557
Something important enough
to torture and kill for.

21:41.798 --> 21:43.928
Which means

21:43.934 --> 21:47.965
we have to keep them from getting it.

21:47.971 --> 21:50.067
Last chance to talk.

21:50.073 --> 21:51.936
Be strong.

21:51.942 --> 21:53.675
You, too.

22:08.248 --> 22:11.611
I'm presenting a breach
plan to the Joint Chiefs.

22:11.617 --> 22:12.817
I know you don't agree.

22:15.443 --> 22:18.852
I have to follow my instincts, Miranda.

22:18.858 --> 22:20.757
I hope you won't hold it against me.

22:23.428 --> 22:26.125
What happened to not bringing
our personal life into work?

22:26.131 --> 22:28.127
I'm so glad I get to know you.

22:28.133 --> 22:30.300
I want to celebrate that.

22:34.006 --> 22:36.102
Nothing's working. We need to go harder.

22:36.108 --> 22:38.116
There are some things we can
do with a little imagination

22:38.140 --> 22:39.566
that are still inside the lines.

22:39.591 --> 22:42.308
Violence isn't the answer.
It's the expectation.

22:42.333 --> 22:44.981
We need to surprise him
with something different.

22:45.006 --> 22:45.511
Alex is right.

22:45.517 --> 22:47.780
We need to figure out something
he doesn't see coming.

22:47.786 --> 22:49.282
I'm surprised somebody who gets off

22:49.288 --> 22:50.183
on pushing people's buttons

22:50.189 --> 22:51.283
suddenly hit his limit.

22:51.289 --> 22:52.284
Oh, I'm sorry.

22:52.290 --> 22:55.020
Are Catholics okay now
with physical cruelty?

22:55.026 --> 22:56.822
Or is that just in the afterlife?

22:56.828 --> 22:59.658
The wonderful fiery
eternity waiting for me.

22:59.664 --> 23:01.122
He gave us his consent.

23:01.147 --> 23:02.333
He gave us permission.

23:02.358 --> 23:03.629
It's still torture,

23:03.635 --> 23:05.614
whether or not the person consents.

23:05.639 --> 23:07.090
This isn't a debate, this is a test,

23:07.096 --> 23:09.292
and us standing around here
arguing instead of acting

23:09.298 --> 23:10.127
is us failing.

23:11.700 --> 23:13.763
I'm gonna go to Owen's
while they're distracted.

23:13.769 --> 23:14.831
Lydia and Owen are both here,

23:14.837 --> 23:16.370
which means the house is empty.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.868
You want to know if I'm
capable of going far enough?

23:18.874 --> 23:20.603
Well, this is my chance.

23:20.609 --> 23:21.971
You want your shot at your first live op?

23:21.977 --> 23:23.940
We need to break his spirit.

23:23.965 --> 23:25.316
He's a proud man.

23:25.322 --> 23:27.018
His daughter's watching.

23:27.024 --> 23:30.988
If we can humiliate him,
make him feel shame,

23:30.994 --> 23:32.490
that's a means of control.

23:32.496 --> 23:33.560
Wow.

23:33.585 --> 23:35.727
There goes that wonderful
Catholic upbringing,

23:35.733 --> 23:36.528
right there.

23:36.534 --> 23:38.133
All right, enough!

23:39.102 --> 23:40.498
I'm going outside.

23:47.044 --> 23:49.340
You keep checking up on me today.

23:49.346 --> 23:50.708
Do I seem like I need it?

23:50.714 --> 23:53.344
Do you want me to lie?

23:53.350 --> 23:55.279
Did you really leave
Harare when you were 10?

23:55.285 --> 23:57.048
Why would I lie about that?

23:57.054 --> 23:59.082
Look, Dayana, I'm an ex-FBI agent.

23:59.088 --> 24:01.752
I know, for instance,
that most immigrants

24:01.758 --> 24:03.430
have to stay past puberty
in their native countries

24:03.454 --> 24:05.422
in order to keep their accents as adults.

24:05.428 --> 24:09.092
I don't think you left at 10.
I think you stayed longer.

24:09.098 --> 24:11.027
I think you grew up under Mugabe.

24:11.033 --> 24:13.296
Maybe I did.

24:13.302 --> 24:15.198
Well, that would mean that
you and your family

24:15.204 --> 24:17.233
most likely saw torture,

24:17.239 --> 24:19.369
or were tortured.

24:19.375 --> 24:20.971
Or were the torturers.

24:20.977 --> 24:23.273
Is that what you're getting at?

24:23.279 --> 24:25.476
My childhood was complicated.

24:25.482 --> 24:27.243
My time in America was not,

24:27.249 --> 24:29.947
and I have worked very hard

24:29.953 --> 24:32.749
to forget the complications.

24:32.755 --> 24:33.616
And this?

24:33.622 --> 24:37.320
This is... is dredging them all up.

24:37.326 --> 24:40.156
It's only week seven.

24:40.162 --> 24:43.126
What's gonna happen week 10, week 15?

24:43.132 --> 24:45.428
What are they turning us into?

24:45.434 --> 24:49.799
You can do bad things
and not lose who you are.

24:49.805 --> 24:53.470
None of us are ever
the worst things we've done.

24:53.476 --> 24:56.739
You've never done the things I've done.

25:01.283 --> 25:03.884
Is this part of the
attempt to humiliate me?

25:07.356 --> 25:10.085
I need to check you
haven't gone hypothermic.

25:11.660 --> 25:13.455
You're not as young as
you were in the field.

25:13.461 --> 25:16.458
I can still take it.

25:16.464 --> 25:18.494
I've played along in
front of the recruits,

25:18.500 --> 25:21.163
but are you really
gonna give up your alias?

25:21.169 --> 25:23.966
I'm taking something from them,

25:23.972 --> 25:25.535
even if they don't realize it.

25:25.541 --> 25:27.537
If I don't give them
something real in return,

25:27.543 --> 25:29.672
then they'll never trust
me or the agency.

25:32.251 --> 25:34.810
Besides, it's not like I'm
gonna use it again.

25:34.816 --> 25:37.479
Unless you've had a change of heart

25:37.485 --> 25:39.984
and you want to tell me who benched me.

25:40.009 --> 25:43.481
And now you're using your
pain as an advantage.

25:43.506 --> 25:45.354
There are always wheels within wheels,

25:45.360 --> 25:46.155
aren't there?

25:47.228 --> 25:50.965
I respect your choices,
but I don't have to give up.

25:50.990 --> 25:52.861
I'm going home.

25:52.867 --> 25:54.363
Getting you a change of clothes.

25:56.137 --> 25:59.301
I know you think I don't care, but I do.

25:59.307 --> 26:01.336
Even if I'm not always sure I should.

26:26.287 --> 26:28.062
Alex.

26:28.068 --> 26:29.834
Alex, are you up here?

26:34.941 --> 26:36.475
What are you doing?

26:48.622 --> 26:51.606
Alex, you're about to have a visitor.

26:51.631 --> 26:53.953
Yeah, no, it's not me. It's down...

26:53.959 --> 26:54.854
Yeah.

26:54.860 --> 26:57.128
Look, don't... don't worry. I'll sort it.

27:02.067 --> 27:02.962
Uh, Lydia?

27:02.968 --> 27:04.764
Lydia.

27:04.770 --> 27:07.267
Can we, uh, please talk
rationally outside the class

27:07.273 --> 27:08.602
before it turns into Abu Ghraib?

27:08.608 --> 27:12.876
I don't have time for
this right now, Harry.

27:14.046 --> 27:16.476
Uh, oh, okay, then.

27:16.482 --> 27:18.211
I'll talk to you later.

27:22.054 --> 27:23.386
Hi.

27:26.058 --> 27:27.654
Phew.

27:27.660 --> 27:29.488
Now, you will be telling me later

27:29.494 --> 27:30.757
what you were doing just now.

27:30.763 --> 27:32.491
After what I just found,

27:32.497 --> 27:34.661
your help will be invaluable.

27:34.667 --> 27:37.315
I can't believe that didn't work.

27:37.340 --> 27:40.464
He wants us to escalate.
No more wasting time.

27:40.489 --> 27:43.335
Look, there are many other
non-violent methods we can use.

27:43.341 --> 27:44.436
We've tried everything.

27:44.442 --> 27:45.471
No, that's not true, not true.

27:45.477 --> 27:47.774
How about a few milligrams
of sodium thiopental

27:47.780 --> 27:48.607
and a nice, clean needle?

27:48.613 --> 27:49.642
You want to drug him?

27:49.648 --> 27:52.129
Yeah, it won't hurt him,
shame him, or torture him.

27:52.154 --> 27:54.480
Yeah, that's right. It's just a
light hangover and an alias later,

27:54.486 --> 27:57.248
and then we can all go home
with our consciences intact.

27:57.254 --> 27:58.505
Oh, that's coming from you?

27:58.529 --> 28:00.251
A guy who'd sell my
kidney on the black market

28:00.257 --> 28:01.920
if it gave him half off
a pint at the Gold Leaf?

28:01.926 --> 28:03.989
What has happened to you?

28:03.995 --> 28:05.523
You've turned into Sun Tzu
all of a sudden.

28:05.529 --> 28:07.592
Or do you just want everyone
to think that you are

28:07.598 --> 28:08.860
so nobody sees you like I do?

28:08.866 --> 28:10.495
They see me. You don't.

28:10.501 --> 28:11.596
But I see you.

28:11.602 --> 28:13.364
Always joking, laughing,

28:13.370 --> 28:14.632
moving around as fast as you can

28:14.638 --> 28:16.201
so nobody sees how alone you are.

28:16.207 --> 28:18.426
How alone I am? Where are you
seeing this exactly, Sebastian?

28:18.450 --> 28:19.604
From the crack in your closet door?

28:19.610 --> 28:20.872
- Okay, Harry, this is not the time.
- No, no.

28:20.878 --> 28:22.640
'Cause you know what I'm seeing
is your eyes lingering on me

28:22.646 --> 28:23.975
whenever I come back from the shower,

28:23.981 --> 28:27.112
or how you're suddenly praying
whenever I start undressing for bed,

28:27.118 --> 28:28.169
and once I'm in bed,

28:28.194 --> 28:29.815
you're studying the sheets
for any tiny movement

28:29.821 --> 28:30.615
in the hope of catching...

28:30.621 --> 28:31.682
- Hey!
- Hey!

28:31.688 --> 28:33.851
Hey! Stop!

28:33.857 --> 28:34.685
Come on!

28:34.691 --> 28:35.886
You got to stop this

28:35.892 --> 28:37.263
before something horrible happens!

28:37.288 --> 28:38.789
This is what happens.

28:38.795 --> 28:41.726
I can't intervene unless you
actually do something wrong.

28:41.732 --> 28:44.294
Look, this won't end until he breaks!

28:44.300 --> 28:45.696
Then let's break him.

28:45.702 --> 28:46.697
Finally.

28:46.703 --> 28:48.196
We have to go further
than they taught us.

28:48.220 --> 28:49.299
We are CIA operatives.

28:49.305 --> 28:51.068
You think that when we're out there,

28:51.074 --> 28:52.834
they're just gonna put
our feet in ice water?

28:54.611 --> 28:55.643
Dayana?

28:56.880 --> 28:59.047
You really want to end this?

29:01.752 --> 29:03.517
Hurt someone they care about.

29:08.124 --> 29:09.853
Get off me.

29:09.859 --> 29:11.721
This is not part of the scenario!

29:11.727 --> 29:12.993
Yes, it is. It's the end.

29:23.952 --> 29:26.181
You got to pull the exercise now.

29:26.187 --> 29:28.050
You don't know what it's
turned into out there.

29:28.056 --> 29:30.185
They are gonna take this
farther than you can handle.

29:30.191 --> 29:33.055
What exactly do you think
being an operative is?

29:33.061 --> 29:33.922
This is it.

29:33.928 --> 29:36.158
They're gonna do what they have to do

29:36.164 --> 29:36.858
until I talk.

29:36.864 --> 29:38.360
That's the way... Just go.

29:38.366 --> 29:40.329
This is not what this agency is about.

29:40.335 --> 29:42.397
This is about what's outside this agency,

29:42.403 --> 29:45.033
what's waiting for all of you,
and it's painful.

29:45.039 --> 29:48.236
And then, while this is painful for me...

29:48.242 --> 29:50.505
that pain is a minute.

29:50.511 --> 29:51.910
You...

29:53.814 --> 29:56.811
Your pain is the long haul,

29:56.817 --> 30:01.015
because now you know what it
feels like to truly hurt someone.

30:01.021 --> 30:03.650
See, for the sociopath
who has no empathy,

30:03.656 --> 30:06.020
torture is easy, but for
the best operatives,

30:06.026 --> 30:08.022
when it's them under the water,

30:08.028 --> 30:09.756
under the rack, the rope, the knife...

30:09.762 --> 30:11.492
they'll remember somewhere inside

30:11.498 --> 30:13.594
that their torturer is a person

30:13.600 --> 30:17.564
who feels the same guilt, shame,
and discomfort that they do.

30:17.570 --> 30:18.866
There are no two sides to this.

30:18.872 --> 30:22.203
Everyone goes through it
to know how to use it.

30:22.209 --> 30:24.438
No one gets away with it.

30:24.444 --> 30:26.444
I tried to tell you.

30:29.016 --> 30:30.059
Ryan.

30:32.952 --> 30:35.694
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
What are you doing?

30:35.719 --> 30:37.117
What are you doing?!

30:37.123 --> 30:39.327
Ryan, this is wrong.

30:46.098 --> 30:48.832
Give up your alias.

30:51.936 --> 30:53.568
Last chance.

30:54.644 --> 30:56.301
You're supposed to be torturing me.

30:56.307 --> 30:57.339
We are.

31:01.112 --> 31:02.307
No. Guys, if you...

31:02.313 --> 31:04.809
Don't listen to him.

31:04.815 --> 31:05.948
It's almost over.

31:15.658 --> 31:16.586
More.

31:18.354 --> 31:19.623
Let him see her.

31:31.007 --> 31:32.269
More.

31:43.885 --> 31:44.814
More.

31:50.492 --> 31:52.455
Jim Dowd!

31:58.133 --> 32:00.663
It was Jim Dowd.

32:03.572 --> 32:06.473
Congratulations. You won.

32:10.879 --> 32:13.376
Congratulations.
You tortured someone.

32:13.382 --> 32:15.511
You know what I did? I did my job.

32:15.517 --> 32:16.579
If Miranda's wrong

32:16.585 --> 32:19.014
and Owen and the AIC haven't
tapped any recruits yet,

32:19.020 --> 32:21.016
who do you think he's gonna
be looking for, hmm?

32:21.022 --> 32:21.817
Someone who can go too far

32:21.823 --> 32:24.177
or someone who doesn't go far enough?

32:24.202 --> 32:25.654
Well, I know what I'm capable of.

32:25.660 --> 32:28.068
What worries me is what this
experience is doing to you.

32:28.093 --> 32:29.191
Oh, don't worry about me.

32:29.197 --> 32:30.058
I'm the man I've always been...

32:30.064 --> 32:32.365
Or is that what you're worried about?

32:40.341 --> 32:41.570
Feel good?

32:41.576 --> 32:44.106
Like you proved something to me today?

32:44.112 --> 32:45.478
Because you didn't.

32:47.415 --> 32:49.744
What'll it take to get you off my back?

32:49.750 --> 32:51.517
I'm not on your back, mate.

32:53.521 --> 32:55.946
You know what I think?

32:55.971 --> 32:58.920
I think you're a man who's
used to getting what he wants.

32:58.926 --> 33:02.356
And you want me.

33:02.362 --> 33:06.260
And it drives you crazy
that you can't have me.

33:06.266 --> 33:09.030
Well, do you know what I think?

33:09.036 --> 33:10.532
I think you're a person

33:10.538 --> 33:13.234
who's never been allowed
to get what he wants.

33:13.240 --> 33:16.704
And I think it was okay for you
to torture someone else today

33:16.710 --> 33:19.240
because you torture yourself every day

33:19.246 --> 33:20.374
to not be who you are.

33:20.380 --> 33:24.278
It pours off you, Sebastian,
but I'll tell you something.

33:24.284 --> 33:30.117
You can love God and yourself.

33:30.123 --> 33:31.989
They're not exclusive.

33:43.570 --> 33:45.103
Unbelievable.

33:51.778 --> 33:55.776
I'd have expected some tier-two
desk analyst to break like that,

33:55.782 --> 33:58.079
- but you...
- They were drowning you.

33:58.085 --> 34:00.280
It's hardly the worst thing
that's ever happened to me,

34:00.286 --> 34:01.815
and you know it.

34:01.821 --> 34:04.851
All this time, you questioned
if I cared about you.

34:04.857 --> 34:06.486
Thought I put my job above you.

34:06.492 --> 34:08.188
And here you are, with proof

34:08.194 --> 34:10.322
I'd give up anything for you.

34:10.329 --> 34:12.257
Vulnerability is liability.

34:12.264 --> 34:14.962
Remember who taught me that?

34:14.967 --> 34:17.496
And now here you are,
the softest of targets,

34:17.503 --> 34:18.531
begging me to give you names

34:18.536 --> 34:21.606
in some perceived conspiracy
that you got benched.

34:24.043 --> 34:26.371
If that were me in there,

34:26.378 --> 34:29.476
and you were being waterboarded,

34:29.482 --> 34:32.315
I'd have let you drown
before I gave up anything.

34:34.987 --> 34:37.617
That's what it means to be an operative.

34:37.623 --> 34:38.650
I was worried before today

34:38.657 --> 34:41.554
that you were too vulnerable
to be active again,

34:41.560 --> 34:43.456
and now... now I'm worried

34:43.462 --> 34:45.625
you shouldn't even be an instructor here.

34:45.630 --> 34:49.629
If you break that easy,

34:49.635 --> 34:51.568
what are you teaching your recruits?

34:59.545 --> 35:01.811
Where are the drives?

35:04.550 --> 35:08.685
This ends with me standing
over your dead body.

35:13.324 --> 35:15.554
No, no, no.

35:15.560 --> 35:16.656
No.

35:18.864 --> 35:20.693
No! No! No!

35:20.699 --> 35:21.727
Stop.

35:21.733 --> 35:23.095
Stop! Stop!

35:23.101 --> 35:26.365
Here, no walking.

35:26.371 --> 35:30.069
Here, a bag instead of a bathroom.

35:30.075 --> 35:33.706
Here, a machine breathes for her.

35:33.712 --> 35:37.609
Here, no movement at all.

35:37.615 --> 35:39.382
Here...

35:40.751 --> 35:41.579
Here.

35:41.585 --> 35:43.748
Stop! No! I'll give you the drives!

35:43.754 --> 35:44.649
I'll give you the drives!

35:44.655 --> 35:46.417
I don't have them, but I know who does.

35:46.423 --> 35:47.752
Her name is Lydia Hall.

35:47.758 --> 35:49.187
She's a CIA operative.

35:49.193 --> 35:50.388
I was with her when she took them.

35:50.394 --> 35:52.098
She's still here.

35:52.123 --> 35:53.658
She has her cellphone.

35:53.664 --> 35:56.027
If you turn off the jamming
signal for even a second,

35:56.033 --> 35:57.211
you can trace her.

35:57.236 --> 35:59.234
Just... just please stop.

36:00.537 --> 36:03.735
All this needless pain. For what?

36:04.909 --> 36:07.538
Everyone breaks, even you.

36:23.888 --> 36:25.288
I have to be with the Joint Chiefs...

36:25.312 --> 36:27.057
when they pass the reins to Claire Haas.

36:27.063 --> 36:28.625
I just want to take a moment,

36:28.631 --> 36:30.364
wish you good luck.

36:31.434 --> 36:32.552
Whoa, what is going on?

36:34.437 --> 36:37.401
This is the phone that the terrorists
have been communicating with.

36:37.407 --> 36:38.635
Paul.

36:38.641 --> 36:39.569
Are you a part of this?

36:39.575 --> 36:41.271
- Part of what?
- Hands behind your back, sir.

36:41.277 --> 36:42.205
That is not mine.

36:42.211 --> 36:44.074
I had no idea how that got into my bag.

36:44.080 --> 36:45.375
Don't say a word.

36:45.381 --> 36:48.211
Not one word until you talk to a lawyer.

36:53.288 --> 36:55.618
You found a laptop and six phones,

36:55.624 --> 36:56.986
but took none of it?

36:56.992 --> 36:58.788
I couldn't risk getting caught by Lydia.

36:58.794 --> 37:00.000
I had to get out of there.

37:00.025 --> 37:02.926
You could've taken a phone or a photo,

37:02.932 --> 37:04.160
or... or memorized call logs.

37:04.166 --> 37:05.562
I can still get them, Shelby.

37:05.568 --> 37:07.430
What if they're not there
when you go back?

37:07.436 --> 37:08.965
Do you think I'm not cut out for this?

37:08.971 --> 37:11.601
- I just wish you'd taken the risk.
- Well, I didn't.

37:11.607 --> 37:14.270
And I don't think you would have
under the circumstances, either.

37:14.276 --> 37:16.005
Yeah, I'm sorry.

37:16.011 --> 37:18.808
I'm just frustrated, that's all.

37:18.814 --> 37:19.943
It's okay.

37:19.949 --> 37:21.177
Hm.

37:21.183 --> 37:22.411
Let me talk to Miranda,

37:22.417 --> 37:24.012
and we'll figure out a new plan.

37:24.018 --> 37:25.313
Yes, thank you.

37:27.455 --> 37:28.851
They're here.

37:35.463 --> 37:36.943
You coming?

38:08.529 --> 38:09.857
Are you ready?

38:17.855 --> 38:19.448
_

38:22.476 --> 38:24.539
Okay.

38:26.514 --> 38:27.808
Let's make your cover.

39:06.618 --> 39:07.880
Hey.

39:07.886 --> 39:10.049
You really like the burgers here, huh?

39:10.055 --> 39:12.418
I also like the liquor
cabinet better than mine.

39:12.424 --> 39:14.287
And after a day like this...

39:14.293 --> 39:16.522
Ooh.

39:16.528 --> 39:18.424
I'm sorry.

39:18.430 --> 39:21.461
Took a very principled stance today.

39:21.467 --> 39:23.396
I like to think I'd have
done the same thing

39:23.402 --> 39:25.030
if I were in your shoes.

39:25.036 --> 39:26.732
What do you mean, "if"?

39:26.738 --> 39:30.136
Well, every class since 9/11
has had to take this challenge.

39:30.142 --> 39:31.937
All I've done is teach them.

39:31.943 --> 39:34.073
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

39:34.079 --> 39:34.974
Now, there was a time

39:34.980 --> 39:37.443
when the CIA didn't operate like this.

39:37.449 --> 39:40.645
People respected how smart the enemy was.

39:40.651 --> 39:45.387
I'm not gonna lie to you.
I miss that time.

39:46.790 --> 39:49.488
And there's so many better
ways to break someone.

39:49.494 --> 39:53.492
If you can be smarter,

39:53.498 --> 39:57.433
you can run circles around
brute force every single time.

39:59.570 --> 40:01.399
Have you had the burger here?

40:01.405 --> 40:03.506
No, but I'd like to.

40:05.510 --> 40:07.172
All right.

40:07.178 --> 40:08.940
I'll make a quick call to Lydia

40:08.946 --> 40:10.775
and tell her I won't be coming home.

40:39.677 --> 40:40.772
You've been selected.

40:40.778 --> 40:43.207
Take this phone. Tell no one.

40:43.213 --> 40:44.709
I understand.

40:51.788 --> 40:54.485
How long were you seeing him?

40:54.491 --> 40:56.387
I saw you in here.

40:56.393 --> 40:59.190
You know that expression,
"love is blind"?

40:59.196 --> 41:01.292
Love makes you blind.

41:01.298 --> 41:02.359
I will say that again.

41:02.365 --> 41:05.629
President Todd will
invoke the 25th Amendment

41:05.635 --> 41:08.732
and hand over power to Vice
President Claire Haas.

41:08.738 --> 41:09.966
I hope she makes the right decision

41:09.972 --> 41:12.069
about how to end this.

41:12.075 --> 41:14.705
Director Shaw, the drones
monitoring the siege site,

41:14.711 --> 41:16.807
they got a signal... Lots of signals.

41:16.813 --> 41:18.742
Every phone inside flashed on at once.

41:18.748 --> 41:21.144
We're about to get a snapshot
of who and where everyone is

41:21.150 --> 41:22.683
in that building.

41:24.653 --> 41:28.484
Now, they've been 10 steps
ahead of us this whole time.

41:28.490 --> 41:30.821
What made them screw up?

41:30.827 --> 41:32.655
I'm so sorry, Dayana.

41:32.661 --> 41:33.890
I should have told them earlier.

41:33.896 --> 41:36.359
- Are you okay?
- It's okay, it's okay.

41:36.365 --> 41:38.061
I don't blame you.

41:41.370 --> 41:42.599
Cut them loose.

41:42.605 --> 41:43.466
What's going on?

41:43.472 --> 41:45.435
It's called a rescue mission, love.

41:45.441 --> 41:47.670
León faked a seizure.
We overpowered the guards.

41:47.676 --> 41:49.672
Word is you've been giving
your best John McClane

41:49.678 --> 41:50.874
for the terrorists.

41:50.880 --> 41:53.276
Figured you could use a Holly or three.

41:53.282 --> 41:54.611
She needs medical attention.

41:54.617 --> 41:56.279
If one of us goes without the others...

41:56.285 --> 41:57.614
We still don't know who to trust.

41:57.620 --> 42:00.916
Okay, there's... there's a bunker
downstairs with medical supplies.

42:00.922 --> 42:02.552
We go there, we stick together.

42:02.558 --> 42:04.454
It's our best chance
against these terrorists.

42:04.460 --> 42:05.288
Who's in?

42:05.294 --> 42:06.889
I am.

42:06.895 --> 42:08.224
I'm in.

42:08.230 --> 42:09.726
I'm in.

42:09.732 --> 42:11.878
Good. 'Cause I'm tired of playing nice.

42:11.903 --> 42:12.964
Let's go.
