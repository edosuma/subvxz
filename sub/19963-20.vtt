00:03.938 --> 00:04.937
(theme song playing)

00:09.110 --> 00:12.378
<i> ¶ I got the wind in my hair</i>
<i> and a fire within ¶</i>

00:12.380 --> 00:14.480

<i>something beginning ¶</i>

00:14.482 --> 00:19.284

00:20.187 --> 00:23.355

00:30.898 --> 00:37.102

00:43.544 --> 00:45.978
¶ ¶

00:50.384 --> 00:52.251
-Good morning, Princess.
-Beautiful day.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.752
Someone's in a hurry.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.054
Gesundheit, m'lady.

00:57.491 --> 00:58.991
You lied to me.

01:01.228 --> 01:04.029
Rapunzel, I just heard
what happened in Old Corona.

01:04.031 --> 01:06.665
I-- I assure you my intent
was only to protect you--

01:06.667 --> 01:08.067
From what?

01:08.069 --> 01:09.835
Your own men?

01:09.837 --> 01:11.437
It's time for answers, Dad.

01:11.439 --> 01:14.206
I want to know why you lied
about Old Corona,

01:14.208 --> 01:16.542
and why you've been
covering up the fact

01:16.544 --> 01:20.112
that our kingdom
is being destroyed
by those black rocks.

01:20.114 --> 01:21.780
What are you trying to hide?

01:21.782 --> 01:23.282
I'm sorry, my dear,

01:23.284 --> 01:25.451
I did not want to lie to you.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.386
but you are not ready
for the truth.

01:27.388 --> 01:29.421
Oh, Dad,
we are beyond

01:29.423 --> 01:31.256
what I am and not
ready for.

01:31.258 --> 01:32.691
People are in danger!

01:32.693 --> 01:34.259
Rapunzel! I am the king,

01:34.261 --> 01:36.795
and I have the situation
under control.

01:39.533 --> 01:42.201
(sighs)
You know, you are not
the first person

01:42.203 --> 01:43.435
to lie to me and tell me

01:43.437 --> 01:45.270
I am not ready
for the real world.

01:46.474 --> 01:47.706
(door slams)

01:49.376 --> 01:50.476
(Pascal grumbles)

01:50.478 --> 01:52.544
So, I guess
it's a pretty safe bet
that Corona

01:52.546 --> 01:55.414
won't be hosting
a daddy-daughter dance
anytime soon?

01:55.416 --> 01:56.381
(laughs)

01:56.383 --> 01:57.616
(squeaks)

01:57.618 --> 01:59.785
Yeah, sorry,
not the time for jokes.

01:59.787 --> 02:02.387
(sighs)
I'm not sure
what's going on,

02:02.389 --> 02:05.457
but I know Corona's
in some kind of danger,

02:05.459 --> 02:09.394
and I feel like
I'm the only one who wants
to do anything about it.

02:09.396 --> 02:10.996
No, no, you're not.

02:10.998 --> 02:13.465
Listen, Blondie,
no matter what we're
up against,

02:13.467 --> 02:15.300
I'm with you all the way.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.902
I know, thank you,
I just--

02:16.904 --> 02:20.005
(sighs)
I think I need
some time alone.

02:20.007 --> 02:22.174
Understood.

02:22.176 --> 02:25.444
You know...
things do seem
pretty dark right now,

02:25.446 --> 02:27.312
but if anyone
can find a light,

02:27.314 --> 02:29.081
it's you.

02:29.083 --> 02:31.450
I've got a feeling
everything's gonna be okay.

02:31.452 --> 02:34.019
Stan:
Quit being so mean, Pete!

02:34.021 --> 02:36.522
Wait! All I said was your breath
smells like tree-rot,

02:36.524 --> 02:37.956
you are a sub-standard
croquet player,

02:37.958 --> 02:40.459
and previous instances
where I asserted you had
a lovely singing voice

02:40.461 --> 02:41.994
were patently false.
(gasps)

02:41.996 --> 02:43.462
(gasps)

02:43.464 --> 02:45.764
You've always loved my voice!

02:45.766 --> 02:47.533
Pete!
What are you doing?

02:47.535 --> 02:48.867
Stan's your best friend!

02:48.869 --> 02:50.636
I know, I can't help it!

02:50.638 --> 02:52.504
It's like I--
I have to say
whatever's on my mind!

02:52.506 --> 02:55.340
Oh, yeah?
Well, you have cookie crumbs
on your cheek. (sobbing)

02:55.342 --> 02:58.110
Stan, wait! I'm sorry!

02:58.112 --> 03:00.479
You've got enough
on your plate, Blondie.
Go get some rest.

03:00.481 --> 03:01.947
I'll handle this.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.615
(sighs)

03:08.122 --> 03:10.455
(waltz music playing)

03:12.960 --> 03:15.060
¶ ¶

03:15.062 --> 03:17.062
Rapunzel, there you are!

03:17.064 --> 03:18.830
Dad, what it all this?

03:18.832 --> 03:22.167
Look, darling,
I feel horrible about
the way we left things,

03:22.169 --> 03:24.736
and, well, I'm hoping
to make it up to you.

03:24.738 --> 03:27.139
Oh, Dad,
I'm so relieved
to hear that--

03:27.141 --> 03:28.407
Ah!

03:30.311 --> 03:32.244
(people screaming)

03:32.246 --> 03:33.445
Oh!

03:37.918 --> 03:39.718
(panting)

03:41.522 --> 03:42.821
(groans)

03:44.858 --> 03:47.426
(panting)

03:47.428 --> 03:50.362
Cassandra! Eugene!

03:50.364 --> 03:51.597
Rapunzel: Oh!

03:51.599 --> 03:53.565
(panting)

03:53.567 --> 03:55.067
Stop running, Rapunzel.

03:55.069 --> 03:56.468
(gasps)

04:00.174 --> 04:02.174
Face your destiny,

04:02.176 --> 04:04.076
or all you hold in your heart

04:04.078 --> 04:06.011
will be in grave danger.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.182
Uh...

04:11.352 --> 04:12.517
(squeaking)

04:12.519 --> 04:14.686
No, Pascal!

04:14.688 --> 04:15.887
Oh!

04:15.889 --> 04:17.522
(gasps for air)

04:17.524 --> 04:19.191
Oh, Pascal!

04:19.193 --> 04:21.126
I would never do anything
to hurt you.

04:22.396 --> 04:24.029
Come on.

04:24.031 --> 04:26.231
(harbor bells ringing)

04:26.233 --> 04:28.533
(seagull caws)

04:28.535 --> 04:30.936
(sighs)
I don't know, Pascal,

04:30.938 --> 04:32.871
I don't even know
what to do anymore.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.106
(squeaks)

04:34.108 --> 04:36.775
Yeah, I know.
There's always a way.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.644
I just have to find it.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.212
(ominous music)

04:40.214 --> 04:41.613
(loud thud)

04:41.615 --> 04:43.015
Did you hear something?

04:44.885 --> 04:46.652
-Ah!
-(chittering)

04:46.654 --> 04:48.387
Oh! Ruddiger!

04:48.389 --> 04:49.655
Where did you come from?

04:51.058 --> 04:52.457
Shh.

04:52.459 --> 04:55.294
Oh, Varian!
Where have you been?

04:55.296 --> 04:58.430
I-I-I've been so
worried about you.

04:58.432 --> 04:59.798
Yeah, uh,

04:59.800 --> 05:01.433
I've had to lie low.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.335
A funny thing,
the people of Corona

05:03.337 --> 05:06.271
aren't too keen
on guys who attack
their princess.

05:06.273 --> 05:07.639
Attack me?

05:07.641 --> 05:10.676
You mean during the storm?
You came for help.

05:10.678 --> 05:13.312
And you got to see
why I needed your help.

05:13.314 --> 05:15.480
¶ ¶

05:15.482 --> 05:17.916
(gasps)
Varian...

05:17.918 --> 05:20.752
I am so sorry! I had no id--

05:20.754 --> 05:23.422
You had to save the kingdom,
you did what you had to,

05:23.424 --> 05:25.524
but you can
help me now, Rapunzel.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.292
Do you have the scroll?

05:27.294 --> 05:30.128
The scroll!
I-I-I got it,
like you asked.

05:30.130 --> 05:33.432
I have no idea what it is,
but my dad was desperate
to keep it from me.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.833
(sighs)

05:34.835 --> 05:36.802
Now, it took me a while
to translate this old language,

05:36.804 --> 05:38.370
but from what I can tell,

05:38.372 --> 05:40.706
those black rocks
are actually some kind of--

05:40.708 --> 05:42.441
of ancient darkness.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.643
Its destructive power
can only be stopped

05:44.645 --> 05:47.045
by its counterpart,
the sun-drop.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.780
Rapunzel! The-- the flower!

05:48.782 --> 05:50.782
You mean<i> the</i> flower?

05:50.784 --> 05:53.719
The one that healed me mom
and gave me my hair?

05:53.721 --> 05:56.621
But... my dad said
it was long gone.

05:56.623 --> 05:58.490
Hmm.

05:58.492 --> 06:01.626
Would you say your dad
has been really a reliable
source or information?

06:01.628 --> 06:03.628
Well, um...

06:03.630 --> 06:06.531
No, Rapunzel!
No, it's still here.
I'm sure of it.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.400
Your dad wouldn't just
throw away something

06:08.402 --> 06:10.302
that could wield
that kind of power.

06:10.304 --> 06:14.005
A single petal from that flower
would solve all of our problems.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.741
That's all we need!

06:15.743 --> 06:18.176
Yeah, but even
if the flower is here,

06:18.178 --> 06:21.546
I don't think we can just
ask my dad to hand it over.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.215
Oh, I know we can't,

06:23.217 --> 06:24.983
which is why
we have to steal it.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.753
¶ ¶

06:31.592 --> 06:35.160
It can be hard to look away
from shiny things, huh, buddy?

06:35.162 --> 06:37.062
The royal chef
just told me

06:37.064 --> 06:39.931
my ears were too big
for my head!

06:39.933 --> 06:42.334
(laughs)
What? No...

06:42.336 --> 06:44.336
It's just your head's
too small for your ears.

06:44.338 --> 06:45.904
No, no, seriously,

06:45.906 --> 06:48.006
people are acting
really strange.

06:48.008 --> 06:50.375
Then you're
gonna love this.

06:50.377 --> 06:51.710
Huh?

06:51.712 --> 06:54.112
I once dropped
the king's éclair on the floor,

06:54.114 --> 06:55.781
but gave it to him anyway.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.182
Uh-oh!

06:57.184 --> 06:59.718
I stole half these medals
from the supply cabinet.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.286
Uh-oh.

07:01.288 --> 07:04.623
(British accent)
People are often impressed
by my regal accent,

07:04.625 --> 07:08.026
but the truth is,
(American accent)
I really sound like this.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.127
Oh!

07:10.264 --> 07:12.764
Yeah, we might wanna
look into this.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.302
(Pascal squeaks)

07:19.773 --> 07:22.307
Ah! Princess,
what are we doing here?

07:22.309 --> 07:24.743
The flower would most likely
be in the royal vault,

07:24.745 --> 07:26.645
-and that is on the other--
-Other side of the castle,
I know.

07:26.647 --> 07:29.047
But if we want to get past
the vault security,

07:29.049 --> 07:31.650
our best bet is to use
the underground tunnels,

07:31.652 --> 07:34.820
and Herz de Sonne's journal
has a complete map of them.

07:35.923 --> 07:38.523
¶ ¶

07:40.994 --> 07:42.360
(sighs)

07:44.665 --> 07:45.831
(Pascal squeaks)

07:51.505 --> 07:52.804
(sighs)

07:52.806 --> 07:54.673
What am I doing?

07:54.675 --> 07:57.642
Rapunzel,
you got what we came for.
Come on, let's go!

07:57.644 --> 08:00.278
Taking the journal,
stealing the flower...

08:00.280 --> 08:02.914
Varian, these are all
acts of treason.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.250
This may be
my dad's only hope.

08:05.252 --> 08:08.019
This... may be
Corona's only hope.

08:08.021 --> 08:10.655
Rapunzel,
Corona needs our help.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.793
For Corona.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.027
Come on.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.831
Blondie,
what you doing?

08:19.833 --> 08:22.501
Doing? Uh, I wasn't
doing anything?

08:22.503 --> 08:24.002
-What do you got there?
-What?

08:25.639 --> 08:27.873
Nothing... nothing!

08:27.875 --> 08:28.974
(squeaks)

08:28.976 --> 08:30.675
Right... okay.

08:30.677 --> 08:33.445
I know you want to be alone,
but Cass and I, we--

08:34.481 --> 08:35.847
(nervous laughter)

08:35.849 --> 08:37.516
You okay?

08:37.518 --> 08:38.817
Mm-hmm!

08:38.819 --> 08:40.218
Rapunzel?

08:41.955 --> 08:43.455
Eugene,

08:43.457 --> 08:46.124
how far would
you go to find
the truth?

08:46.126 --> 08:47.792
Personally...

08:47.794 --> 08:49.027
not very far.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.162
Frankly, the truth's
not all it's cracked up to be.

08:51.164 --> 08:52.898
Blondie, you sure
you're all right?

08:52.900 --> 08:54.900
Yeah, sorry.

08:54.902 --> 08:57.802
I just, I've had a lot
to process lately.

08:57.804 --> 09:00.171
I promise I'll talk
when I'm ready, okay?

09:00.173 --> 09:01.540
Okay.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.475
Just let me know
if you need anything.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.480
Uh, Blondie?

09:10.484 --> 09:11.816
Hmm...

09:11.818 --> 09:14.553
I found the entrance!
Down here!

09:14.555 --> 09:15.820
(grunts)

09:17.658 --> 09:19.090
(chittering)

09:20.027 --> 09:21.560
We have to go this way.

09:21.562 --> 09:23.929
(Ruddiger chittering)

09:26.700 --> 09:28.934
Um...

09:28.936 --> 09:30.435
that way?

09:31.572 --> 09:33.338
Wow...

09:33.340 --> 09:36.741
Oh, oh! These tunnels
depict an ancient technology
of pre-Corona-era--

09:36.743 --> 09:38.076
(screams)

09:38.078 --> 09:39.911
(whimpering)

09:39.913 --> 09:41.713
Uh... yeah, this way.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.915
We've gotta be careful.
Herz der Sonne's tunnels

09:43.917 --> 09:45.584
may have
long been forgotten,

09:45.586 --> 09:47.953
but that doesn't mean
they're not dangerous.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.422
They are lined with
deadly booby traps.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.791
(laughs)
As you can recall,

09:52.793 --> 09:54.392
I know a thing or two
about booby traps.

09:54.394 --> 09:55.961
-Varian, watch out!
-Huh?

09:55.963 --> 09:57.862
Oh! Whoa!

09:57.864 --> 09:59.831
Well, that's one down.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.667
(Pascal grumbles)

10:08.542 --> 10:10.542
Uh-oh!

10:10.544 --> 10:11.943
Huh...

10:11.945 --> 10:14.412
(rumbling)

10:14.414 --> 10:15.747
(screams)

10:15.749 --> 10:17.983
We're gonna get squished!

10:21.888 --> 10:23.388
Ah! Ah!

10:23.390 --> 10:25.156
(rumbling)

10:25.158 --> 10:26.825
(screams)

10:31.632 --> 10:35.400
Pascal, wedge this
into the axle to stop it
from turning.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.534
Hurry!

10:38.338 --> 10:40.739
(metal creaking)

10:43.577 --> 10:44.743
(squeaks)

10:44.745 --> 10:46.444
Oh! Good.

10:46.446 --> 10:49.314
Now, go behind the wall
to find some sort of release
mechanism.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.686
(metal creaking)

10:55.856 --> 10:57.756
(shrieks)

10:59.426 --> 11:00.959
Pascal!

11:00.961 --> 11:02.594
Ah!

11:02.596 --> 11:03.795
Oh!

11:03.797 --> 11:05.930
Pascal, do something!

11:07.100 --> 11:08.533
Hurry!

11:10.370 --> 11:11.970
Ah! Whoa! Whoa!

11:11.972 --> 11:13.304
Ahh!

11:13.306 --> 11:15.640
(metal creaking)

11:15.642 --> 11:18.443
-(squeaks)
-Pascal, you did it!

11:18.445 --> 11:20.478
I think I'm gonna
be sick.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.047
(crowd chattering)

11:22.049 --> 11:24.716
How dare you point out
my obvious flaws

11:24.718 --> 11:27.686
with cutting accuracy?
I'll box your ears!

11:27.688 --> 11:30.321
You take that back!
I don't care how true it is!

11:30.323 --> 11:33.191
Let's see you speak your truths
with a mouth full of strudel!

11:33.193 --> 11:35.060
This is getting out of hand.

11:35.062 --> 11:37.328
Yeah, this reminds me
of Xavier's mood potion,

11:37.330 --> 11:40.031
only now, everyone can't help
but tell the truth.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.633
Out of my way, Big Ears.

11:41.635 --> 11:43.168
(coughs)
Except for that guy.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.670
He had no idea
what he's talking about.

11:45.672 --> 11:47.505
If this is some kind
of truth potion,

11:47.507 --> 11:50.241
we have to figure out
how it got into the castle.

11:50.243 --> 11:53.411
Who was the first person
you noticed being a little
too honest?

11:53.413 --> 11:55.513
-Hmm...
-<i> Okay, Pete...</i>

11:55.515 --> 11:58.249
let's start at the beginning.
Walk us through your day.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.918
And relax,
just tell us what happened.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.886
Well,
I woke up
confused,

12:01.888 --> 12:02.987
because my mouth

12:02.989 --> 12:05.006
tasted like beans,

12:05.007 --> 12:07.024
but I had no recollection
of eating beans the day prior.

12:07.027 --> 12:10.762
Then I saw my cat, and I said,
"Hello, Mr. Happy-Paws"!

12:10.764 --> 12:12.430
Who's a fluffernutter?

12:12.432 --> 12:13.998
-Of course, he can't talk.
-(exasperated sighs)

12:16.670 --> 12:18.069
Tripwire.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.174
(squeaks)

12:25.178 --> 12:26.611
Pascal, no!

12:26.613 --> 12:29.013
I need you to carefully

12:29.015 --> 12:30.915
let go of that spider.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.055
Both: Phew!

12:37.057 --> 12:38.523
Phew!

12:38.525 --> 12:40.125
-(wire snaps)
-(chitters)

12:40.127 --> 12:41.226
(rumbling)

12:41.228 --> 12:43.128
¶ ¶

12:43.130 --> 12:44.429
Watch it!

12:44.431 --> 12:45.864
(sighs)

12:45.866 --> 12:46.931
Oh...

12:46.933 --> 12:48.299
Everyone okay?

12:48.301 --> 12:50.368
We're getting closer
to the surface.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.936
We don't want to alarm
the guards.

12:51.938 --> 12:55.039
Oh, I'm pretty sure
they and everyone else
have their hands full.

12:55.041 --> 12:57.108
-(snickers)
-Huh? What do you mean?

12:57.110 --> 12:58.076
N-nothing.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.044
Uh, it's just,
um, they...

13:00.046 --> 13:02.213
have their hands full
every day! (laughs)

13:02.215 --> 13:04.215
Corona, you know?

13:04.217 --> 13:05.984
Busiest kingdom
on earth!

13:05.986 --> 13:08.153
-Whoa! Whoa! Oh!
-Varian!

13:08.155 --> 13:09.954
Hang on!

13:09.956 --> 13:11.656
Way ahead of you!

13:11.658 --> 13:14.125
(groaning)

13:15.495 --> 13:18.163
(loud rumbling)

13:18.165 --> 13:19.964
-What do we do?
-I'm gonna go with...

13:19.966 --> 13:21.800
run!

13:23.270 --> 13:26.171
I got into work,
high-fived Stan,

13:26.173 --> 13:27.605
and I noticed
his hand was sweaty,

13:27.607 --> 13:29.274
-Gah! Aah!
-Oh, boy!

13:29.276 --> 13:31.242
-You are scary!
-Listen, we've been here
for 30 minutes,

13:31.244 --> 13:34.779
and all you've been doing
is boring us with useless
information!

13:34.781 --> 13:37.949
Useless! I gave you my recipe
for strawberry scones!

13:37.951 --> 13:39.951
That was the most
useless part!

13:39.953 --> 13:42.153
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
let's try this.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.689
Can you recall anything
out of the ordinary?

13:44.691 --> 13:48.159
Maybe something not
soul-crushingly boring?

13:48.161 --> 13:50.028
Well, I did find

13:50.030 --> 13:52.130
the man in the bush
who gave me purple cookies

13:52.132 --> 13:54.165
a bit peculiar.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.501
(scoffs)
You think you might
have led with that?

13:56.503 --> 13:59.170
Everybody's been
eating these things!

13:59.172 --> 14:00.705
Don't!

14:00.707 --> 14:02.974
Someone may have laced them
with some kind of truth serum.

14:02.976 --> 14:06.477
Listen, Pete,
what else can you tell us
about the man in the bush?

14:06.479 --> 14:09.547
Well, let's see,
his voice was kind of...

14:09.549 --> 14:11.149
squeaky?

14:11.151 --> 14:14.185
Oh, and he was asking
about the sun-drop flower,

14:14.187 --> 14:16.721
which the king has been
secretly hiding in the vault

14:16.723 --> 14:18.156
ever since he used it
on the queen.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.692
Wait, wait, wait--
the sun-drop flower?

14:20.694 --> 14:24.128
So...
someone with a squeaky voice
trying to keep a low profile

14:24.130 --> 14:27.198
used a potion
to get information
about a magical flower.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.000
Sound like anyone
we know?

14:29.002 --> 14:32.971
Varian!
So that's why Rapunzel
was acting so peculiar.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.572
Come on,
she might be in trouble!

14:35.909 --> 14:37.642
(panting)

14:39.846 --> 14:41.079
(chittering)

14:42.182 --> 14:44.782
¶ ¶

14:48.555 --> 14:50.388
Come on, guys! This way!

14:52.259 --> 14:53.925
Whoa!

14:58.431 --> 15:00.031
(grunting)

15:00.033 --> 15:02.000
(panting)

15:02.002 --> 15:03.868
That was too close.

15:03.870 --> 15:06.337
You are sure this flower
is worth it, right?

15:06.339 --> 15:08.539
It's Corona's only hope?

15:08.541 --> 15:12.076
It should be, but, uh,
I'm not really concerned
about Corona.

15:12.078 --> 15:15.113
(gasps)
You don't care about Corona?

15:15.115 --> 15:18.616
Uh, I mean,
of course I'm concerned
about Corona,

15:18.618 --> 15:20.785
I love Corona,
I just meant, right now...

15:20.787 --> 15:23.221
I'm really concerned
about how it's gonna
help my dad.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.156
Corona, too!

15:31.298 --> 15:34.799
Out of the way, boys!
We need to get into the vault
and get the sun-drop flower!

15:34.801 --> 15:37.035
Sun-drop flower?

15:37.037 --> 15:39.370
Why, whatever do you mean?

15:39.372 --> 15:43.107
Oh... I heard...
the sun-drop flower...
was destroyed...

15:43.109 --> 15:45.209
We know the secret--
Let us in!

15:45.211 --> 15:47.312
The princess could be
in grave danger!

15:49.316 --> 15:52.550
(out of breath)
Oh, it's a dead-end.

15:52.552 --> 15:55.286
No, this is it.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.889
We are right under the vault.

15:57.891 --> 15:59.457
Do you see that trap-door?

15:59.459 --> 16:01.326
Yeah, how do we
get it open?

16:01.328 --> 16:03.127
Hmm...

16:04.965 --> 16:07.832
One... two... three... four...

16:07.834 --> 16:10.601
five... six... seven...

16:10.603 --> 16:12.804
Seven pillars.

16:13.907 --> 16:15.006
Huh.

16:15.942 --> 16:18.843
(mechanical whirring)

16:18.845 --> 16:20.411
(air blowing)

16:32.258 --> 16:34.359
(thundering footsteps)

16:34.361 --> 16:36.728
Uh, Varian?

16:38.331 --> 16:40.498
Fascinating!

16:40.500 --> 16:42.633
I believe this is an automaton,

16:42.635 --> 16:45.336
a marvel of ancient
technology, really.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.339
-I've heard about them,
but to see one--
-Varian! Look out!

16:50.343 --> 16:53.344
Don't worry, princess,
I've got this.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.712
(grunts)

16:54.714 --> 16:56.447
(explosion)

16:56.449 --> 16:58.182
(grunts)

17:00.353 --> 17:02.987
See? I told ya!
I got this...

17:02.989 --> 17:04.689
Uh, Varian?

17:04.691 --> 17:06.324
(screams)

17:06.326 --> 17:08.393
Oh...

17:08.395 --> 17:11.295
Despite the excruciating pain
and the fact I am about
to pass out,

17:11.297 --> 17:14.465
the science at work here
is spellbinding!

17:17.070 --> 17:18.803
We're gonna need
some kind of a plan

17:18.805 --> 17:20.505
if we're gonna defeat
that thing.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.673
Uh... hey, you!

17:22.675 --> 17:24.542
-Metal-head!
-Automaton!

17:24.544 --> 17:26.377
Come and get it!

17:30.750 --> 17:33.418
Distract him
and draw him towards you!

17:37.357 --> 17:39.057
(explosion)

17:51.371 --> 17:54.539
(powering down)

17:54.541 --> 17:56.507
Come on, let's go!

18:00.880 --> 18:02.847
Varian: Hmm...

18:02.849 --> 18:05.516
Guard: Sorry, strict orders
from the king.

18:05.518 --> 18:08.586
No one is permitted
beyond this point.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.222
Let's ask ourselves
a question, shall we?

18:11.224 --> 18:13.357
Whose wrath
would you rather face,

18:13.359 --> 18:16.461
the king's, or hers?

18:16.463 --> 18:17.595
(knuckles crack)

18:20.066 --> 18:22.934
¶ ¶

18:27.707 --> 18:29.273
(strikes match)

18:42.322 --> 18:44.422
There it is!

18:44.424 --> 18:46.124
The flower!

18:52.298 --> 18:54.398
Varian!

18:54.400 --> 18:57.768
Wait, wait, wait!
You said... you were just
gonna take one petal?

18:57.770 --> 19:00.104
But what if one petal's
not enough to harvest
what I need?

19:00.106 --> 19:02.473
-Varian!
-What difference does it make?

19:02.475 --> 19:05.243
It's just sitting here,
rotting, anyway!

19:05.245 --> 19:08.312
(gasps) That flacon...

19:08.314 --> 19:11.682
That had Xavier's
mood potion in it.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.618
Varian, that potion
is dangerous.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.486
You shouldn't
be fooling with it!

19:15.488 --> 19:17.655
There was just one drop left,

19:17.657 --> 19:21.259
but it was enough for me
to replicate and modify.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.761
I had to be sure
the flower was here.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.963
So you made a truth serum

19:25.965 --> 19:28.166
and gave it to everyone?

19:28.168 --> 19:29.667
(laughs)

19:29.669 --> 19:31.536
You'd be surprised
what people will tell you
for a cookie.

19:31.538 --> 19:34.639
(gasps) Pete? Stan?

19:34.641 --> 19:36.340
How could you?

19:36.342 --> 19:37.475
Oh, do you honestly

19:37.477 --> 19:38.709
expect me to be concerned

19:38.711 --> 19:40.378
about the welfare of Corona?

19:40.380 --> 19:42.380
-But you said you--
-Rapunzel!

19:42.382 --> 19:44.148
I used you!

19:44.150 --> 19:46.184
I've been to you,
and this kingdom, for help.

19:46.186 --> 19:49.287
Everyone
turned their back on me!
It has to be this way.

19:50.490 --> 19:54.192
I defied a direct order
from my father, the king,

19:54.194 --> 19:55.960
because I trusted you.

19:55.962 --> 19:58.896
We both broke the law.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.632
Give me the flower, Varian.
We can find a way to fix
all of this,

20:01.634 --> 20:04.535
the rocks, your dad,
everything. I promise you.

20:04.537 --> 20:07.872
I promise!
Just-- this is not the way.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.106
Please?

20:10.577 --> 20:11.809
(doors rattling)

20:11.811 --> 20:13.878
Sorry, Princess,

20:13.880 --> 20:17.248
but I know firsthand
how well you keep promises.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.183
-(doors rattling)
-There he is!

20:19.185 --> 20:20.618
Get him!

20:22.388 --> 20:24.488
¶ ¶

20:24.490 --> 20:25.923
(coughing)

20:25.925 --> 20:27.525
Rapunzel, are you okay?

20:27.527 --> 20:30.528
(coughing)
I'm fine...

20:30.530 --> 20:32.463
Varian!

20:36.002 --> 20:38.769
(tower bell ringing)

20:38.771 --> 20:41.105
The royal medic
said the effects of the potion

20:41.107 --> 20:43.174
will wear off on their own,
eventually.

20:43.176 --> 20:45.576
Hey, everything's
gonna be okay.

20:45.578 --> 20:48.045
Really? I broke the law,

20:48.047 --> 20:49.413
I stole from my own father,

20:49.415 --> 20:51.215
and committed treason!

20:51.217 --> 20:52.917
(sighs)

20:52.919 --> 20:55.586
And you know
what the worst part is?

20:55.588 --> 20:59.223
I let the most powerful object
in all of the land

20:59.225 --> 21:01.425
fall into the hands of...

21:01.427 --> 21:04.629
I don't even know
what he is anymore.

21:05.632 --> 21:08.766
But I know we haven't
seen the last of him.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.869
¶ ¶

21:23.049 --> 21:26.284
(mechanical whirring)

21:27.587 --> 21:29.153
Work! Work!

21:29.155 --> 21:30.721
Please, work!

21:33.126 --> 21:34.659
No...

21:34.661 --> 21:36.327
No, no, no!

21:36.329 --> 21:38.496
No! This is useless!

21:38.498 --> 21:41.666
It's like it no longer
holds the sun-drop's power!

21:41.668 --> 21:44.502
Rapunzel:
<i> You mean the flower?</i>

21:44.504 --> 21:47.838
<i> The one that healed my mom</i>
<i> and gave me my hair?</i>

21:47.840 --> 21:51.309
Varian:
<i> The rocks are demonstrating</i>
<i> an actual physical response...</i>

21:51.311 --> 21:53.577
<i> to you.</i>

21:55.481 --> 21:59.417
The sun-drop
isn't the flower...
anymore...

22:03.756 --> 22:05.890
It's Rapunzel!

22:07.593 --> 22:10.594
(theme music playing)

22:10.596 --> 22:13.497
<i> ¶ Now I got my eyes open</i>
<i> and wide ¶</i>

22:13.499 --> 22:16.133
<i> ¶ My heart burnin' like fire ¶</i>

22:16.135 --> 22:18.302
<i> ¶ Feels like</i>
<i> I'm so alive ¶</i>

22:18.304 --> 22:20.171
<i> ¶ I'm never goin' back ¶</i>

22:20.173 --> 22:23.007
<i> ¶ Whatever I want now,</i>
<i> I'm gonna chase ¶</i>

22:23.009 --> 22:25.509
<i> ¶ Who I am,</i>
<i> I can't contain it ¶</i>

22:25.511 --> 22:28.846
<i> ¶ I'm not gonna hold it in ¶</i>

22:28.848 --> 22:30.981
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's more of me</i>
<i> to give ¶</i>

22:30.983 --> 22:32.650
<i> ¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh ¶</i>

22:32.652 --> 22:33.851
<i> ¶ Oh yeah ¶</i>

22:33.853 --> 22:35.953
<i> ¶ There's more of me to give ¶</i>
