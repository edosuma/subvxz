00:01.668 --> 00:04.796
Yes. Yes, I Iove you too, Mom.

00:04.971 --> 00:07.132
Yes, Mommy. Okay.

00:08.108 --> 00:11.441
Mom ! No, I'm not gonna get
my nose pierced.

00:12.612 --> 00:15.547
Yes, Mom, I'm very happy
with the hoIes that God gave me.

00:17.884 --> 00:21.342
Mom.... Am I eating a baIanced diet?

00:26.926 --> 00:27.950
I'd say so.

00:29.429 --> 00:32.592
Mom, no, I'm not making
any extra work for Geoffrey.

00:33.199 --> 00:34.860
He hardIy even knows I'm here.

00:34.934 --> 00:38.165
Mom, I toId you this morning,
CarIton and I are getting aIong great.

00:40.273 --> 00:44.539
Mom, I keep.... Yo, everything is
Mop & GIo, Mom. They Iove me here.

00:46.079 --> 00:47.068
WiII!

00:47.147 --> 00:49.707
Excuse me, Mom, me and UncIe PhiI
are about to go for a run.

02:04.691 --> 02:07.319
Another minute, madam,
and perhaps we'II have a diamond.

02:09.162 --> 02:12.654
I don't know why PhiIip insisted
on putting in aII these new gadgets.

02:12.732 --> 02:16.463
To heat something up, I have to be
Lt. Uhura of the <i>Starship Enterprise.</i>

02:18.304 --> 02:21.432
Mom, I can't use the phone.
We're aII supposed to share it...

02:21.508 --> 02:23.874
but WiII taIks to KathIeen
morning, noon and night.

02:23.943 --> 02:26.935
I've been putting up with it for
weeks, and excuse my strong Ianguage...

02:27.013 --> 02:28.571
but I am not a happy camper.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.911
WiII's in Iove, baby.
I think it's sweet.

02:33.419 --> 02:37.185
No, no, no, baby.
No, I wuv you more. Yes.

02:38.758 --> 02:40.783
No, no, no, no, I wuv you more!

02:42.395 --> 02:43.885
AII right, you wuv me more.

02:44.797 --> 02:47.891
Isn't that romantic?
He's quoting EImer Fudd.

02:51.437 --> 02:53.029
HoId on, KathIeen.

02:55.441 --> 02:57.306
CIick on the other Iine.

02:57.744 --> 02:58.733
Hi! It's me!

03:00.380 --> 03:04.510
No, no, no, I miss you more.
No! I miss you more.

03:04.817 --> 03:07.945
AII right, you miss me more.
Oh, you gotta go?

03:08.955 --> 03:10.149
I'm gonna miss you.

03:10.456 --> 03:12.151
No, no, I'm gonna miss you more!

03:16.596 --> 03:18.291
Nice trick by Aunt Viv.

03:19.732 --> 03:22.667
Dad got us aII tickets
to the PeopIe's Choice Awards.

03:22.735 --> 03:25.465
Thanks for butting in, HiIary.
Anyway, the best part is--

03:25.538 --> 03:28.371
We get to sit with ArnoId Schwarzenegger
and Maria Shriver.

03:28.942 --> 03:32.105
-HiIary, you promised I couId teII.
-I know. I Iied.

03:34.847 --> 03:36.041
I am so excited!

03:36.115 --> 03:38.447
Everyone from the A Iist is
gonna be there, which means...

03:38.518 --> 03:40.713
none of my friends are gonna be there,
which means...

03:40.787 --> 03:43.415
they are aII going to corrode
with envy and hate my guts.

03:43.523 --> 03:44.512
I Iove it!

03:45.892 --> 03:49.589
I'm going to meet ArnoId Schwarzenegger.
Thank you, sir!

03:49.662 --> 03:51.562
-Thank you!
-HoId on, Geoffrey.

04:03.843 --> 04:07.643
Geoffrey. You're not having dinner
with the Terminator.

04:08.648 --> 04:11.640
-I didn't get you a ticket.
-That's ugIy.

04:13.553 --> 04:17.512
PhiIip, how couId you be so insensitive?
Geoffrey is a part of this famiIy.

04:17.957 --> 04:22.053
-Major <i>faux pas,</i> Dad.
-Poor Geoffrey.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.722
Like his Iife isn't sad enough aIready.

04:28.234 --> 04:32.068
Look, Geoffrey, I sincereIy apoIogize
for my oversight...

04:32.138 --> 04:35.005
but since this means so much to you,
and you are a part of the famiIy...

04:35.074 --> 04:38.009
I'm sure someone here wiII be gIad
to give up their ticket for you.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.443
-These juice sticks....
-I have to caII Toni.

04:46.853 --> 04:48.650
Takeout food again?

04:48.721 --> 04:51.315
WeII, we were having Ieg of Iamb...

04:51.391 --> 04:53.859
but I accidentaIIy put the oven
on seIf-cIeaning...

04:53.926 --> 04:55.484
and now the door won't open.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.067
Takeout again?

05:03.169 --> 05:05.467
No, HiIary, I bought a new set
of Styrofoam.

05:06.873 --> 05:09.774
Gosh, Mom, who put the rusty naiIs
in your granoIa?

05:11.311 --> 05:15.077
Look, aII this hi-tech has got me
a IittIe on edge. I'm so sorry, sweetie.

05:18.084 --> 05:21.918
Takeout food again?
What happened to the Ieg of Iamb?

05:22.055 --> 05:24.046
It's being cIeaned! Is that a probIem?

05:25.858 --> 05:28.383
Geoffrey, we're ready to serve dinner!

05:28.461 --> 05:29.860
Takeout again?

05:29.929 --> 05:32.898
My baby's observant. 
Isn't she observant?

05:33.633 --> 05:37.000
Not that observant.
KathIeen, your bIouse is unbuttoned.

05:37.136 --> 05:38.501
-Let me.
-Let her.

05:38.571 --> 05:39.868
Better idea.

05:41.574 --> 05:43.667
That food smeIIs terribIe.

05:43.743 --> 05:45.506
I feeI Iike I'm sitting in coach.

05:50.583 --> 05:54.212
Oh, thank you for inviting me
to the PeopIe's Choice Awards.

05:55.722 --> 05:57.383
Think nothing of it,
it was no big deaI.

05:57.457 --> 06:00.790
Oh, it was more than a big deaI,
UncIe PhiI, it was a humongous deaI!

06:02.862 --> 06:05.057
I know, and we get to sit
with aII the stars!

06:06.766 --> 06:09.394
PeopIe wouId kiII to get those tickets.

06:10.436 --> 06:12.802
Pardon me whiIe I go get a knife.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.231
-PhiIip!
-I'II get him a ticket.

06:16.909 --> 06:21.437
Everyone, Iook what WiII did.
He cut my steak in the shape of a heart.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.208
Isn't he artistic?

06:23.750 --> 06:25.911
ActuaIIy, that was a puppy.

06:26.986 --> 06:30.251
Oh, whatever it is, it's beautifuI.
I'm gonna save it.

06:30.323 --> 06:33.815
And every time I Iook at it,
I'm gonna think of my baby.

06:37.697 --> 06:39.289
Excuse me.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.728
This is the dinner tabIe,
not the back seat of a Chevy.

06:42.869 --> 06:45.337
I want to taIk to you two
in the other room. Now.

06:47.440 --> 06:50.932
Now, it's time we discussed
this reIationship. Vivian, discuss it.

06:53.279 --> 06:57.238
-What PhiIip is trying to say is--
-Don't come around here with no babies.

07:00.653 --> 07:03.087
HoId it, hoId it.
Is that what this is aII about?

07:03.156 --> 07:05.556
Look, UncIe PhiI, Aunt Viv,
I think you guys can reIax.

07:05.625 --> 07:08.594
You don't have to worry about us
coming around here with no babies.

07:08.661 --> 07:10.686
I mean, we don't even know no babies.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.524
Look, kids, now,
we know you care about each other...

07:13.599 --> 07:15.794
but you have onIy been dating
a short time.

07:15.902 --> 07:18.097
The kind of thing you're taIking about
takes commitment.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.571
You know, Aunt Viv,
you're absoIuteIy right.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.608
Commitment is what this is aII about.

07:22.675 --> 07:24.768
And as a token of my commitment...

07:24.844 --> 07:27.074
I got KathIeen this ring.

07:27.413 --> 07:29.404
-Oh, WiII!
-Oh, no.

07:29.515 --> 07:30.777
Oh, God!

07:35.655 --> 07:38.283
Geoffrey, where have you been?
I've been Iooking aII over for you.

07:38.357 --> 07:41.849
Mrs. Banks sent me on some errands.
That is my job.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.857
I am but a IowIy servant.

07:44.464 --> 07:49.231
Geoffrey, it took some doing,
but I managed to get you a ticket.

07:49.902 --> 07:52.837
Thank you sir. I am most gratefuI.

07:53.105 --> 07:55.164
Now I won't have to sIash your tires.

07:58.244 --> 08:01.611
-I'm sitting next to ArnoId.
-No, I'm sitting next to ArnoId.

08:01.681 --> 08:04.809
I don't want my tires sIashed.
Geoffrey's sitting next to ArnoId.

08:05.318 --> 08:08.185
This dress makes me want to puke.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.290
You can't even teII I have a figure.

08:11.357 --> 08:14.019
You're 13 years oId.
You're not aIIowed to have a figure.

08:14.694 --> 08:17.128
-You Iook better.
-No, no, no, no, baby, you Iook better.

08:17.196 --> 08:20.688
-No, you Iook better.
-AII right, I Iook better.

08:21.534 --> 08:23.058
Except for that rock.

08:23.836 --> 08:24.825
Man!

08:25.037 --> 08:28.529
If you vaIue your vision,
you won't Iook directIy into the rock.

08:30.943 --> 08:32.740
I Iove it, WiII, thank you.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.169
Dad?

08:42.221 --> 08:44.849
-I'm ready.
-FinaIIy! What took you so Iong?

08:45.091 --> 08:49.084
Oh, I just spent an hour chasing
my outfit on the new rotating dress rack.

08:57.103 --> 08:59.765
Why didn't you set
the variabIe speed adjuster?

09:00.606 --> 09:03.734
PhiIip, these gadgets are
making my Iife miserabIe.

09:03.910 --> 09:06.003
Baby, you're the one
that's wanted to redecorate.

09:06.078 --> 09:09.570
WeII, yeah, I wanted to keep up
with the Joneses, honey, not the Jetsons!

09:11.717 --> 09:14.845
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look,
before y'aII spIit each other's wigs...

09:14.921 --> 09:17.048
-can we have our tickets, pIease?
-Oh, sure.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.158
You Iost them, didn't you?

09:20.226 --> 09:23.821
No I did not Iose them, thank you
very much. I know exactIy where they are.

09:23.963 --> 09:26.261
They're in my desk, in my office...

09:27.133 --> 09:28.532
downtown.

09:29.569 --> 09:33.061
No probIem. We'II just hop
on my dress rack and swing by.

09:36.042 --> 09:39.534
Geoffrey, Mrs. Banks and I
are going to swing by my office.

09:39.612 --> 09:41.170
WiII's going to ride with KathIeen...

09:41.247 --> 09:43.715
and you can drive the kids,
so we'II meet you at the awards.

09:43.783 --> 09:45.307
Very good, sir.

09:45.985 --> 09:50.422
Boy, this is a rare treat.
I get to cruise BeverIy HiIIs in a VoIvo.

09:55.695 --> 09:59.131
HoId up, baby. I want to go get my Iucky
mitt. I want DarryI Strawberry to sign it.

09:59.198 --> 10:00.426
What's your Iucky mitt?

10:00.499 --> 10:03.093
It's sort of Iike my Iucky drawers,
except I wear it on my hand.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.873
Man, this door is Iike
straight out of <i>Blacula.</i>

10:10.943 --> 10:13.844
It's Iike the '70s
crawIed up in here and died.

10:13.946 --> 10:16.813
Yeah, J. J. WaIker's Iips are probabIy
around here somewhere.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.954
This is aII my stuff I brought from PhiIIy,
you know. When I get homesick...

10:25.024 --> 10:27.390
I come down here.
It makes me feeI better.

10:27.827 --> 10:29.226
Where's my mitt at?

10:31.964 --> 10:33.454
Here it is.

10:36.435 --> 10:38.960
My mom gave me this.
She taught me how to pIay.

10:39.071 --> 10:40.629
That's why I took up basketbaII.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.032
Oh, hoId on.

10:43.909 --> 10:45.376
Yo, Teddy...

10:45.478 --> 10:46.467
jam.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.316
Man, I used to Iove this oId thing.

10:51.384 --> 10:54.876
-He's so cute!
-But I'm cuter.

10:57.089 --> 10:58.078
Beat it, Ted.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.260
See? I toId you
I knew where they were.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.163
-Fine, PhiIip, Iet's go.
-Okay.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.726
Vivian? Did you see--

11:11.604 --> 11:14.072
Oh, my God. PhiIip?

11:16.742 --> 11:18.869
Geoffrey! Take it easy on the curves!

11:18.944 --> 11:21.913
It's not me, Master CarIton, it's
the road. It thinks it's an....

11:21.981 --> 11:24.415
Earthquake!

11:31.157 --> 11:32.146
WiII?

11:32.458 --> 11:36.861
-It's over, WiII, we're aII right.
-The ground moved, aII right?

11:36.962 --> 11:40.420
The ground. The ground moved,
aII right? The ground moved!

11:41.233 --> 11:43.793
Baby, it was just a IittIe earthquake.

11:43.869 --> 11:48.169
Baby, no, Iisten, no. The ground moved,
okay? The ground. The ground moved.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.902
Nobody was bothering it,
it just moved, aII right?

11:51.477 --> 11:55.743
-But it's over now, and we're fine.
-I am not fine, aII right?

11:55.815 --> 11:58.249
I'm a grown man sitting under a tabIe
hugging a teddy bear.

11:58.317 --> 12:01.946
-I am not fine.
-Oh, poor baby.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.715
I'm reaIIy, reaIIy not fine.

12:10.763 --> 12:12.697
I'm reaIIy, reaIIy, reaIIy not fine.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.227
Come on, Iet's get up
and find out what's going on.

12:17.336 --> 12:19.668
HoId it, baby.
I'm reaIIy reaIIy not fine, though.

12:21.440 --> 12:23.465
WiII, I think the door's stuck.

12:23.676 --> 12:26.509
Oh, no, no. No, dear,
you must be crazy.

12:27.012 --> 12:28.809
I won't Iet this door be stuck.

12:29.815 --> 12:31.146
Okay, I can't breathe.

12:34.754 --> 12:39.054
CaIm down. Look, someone's got
to come home sometime.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.289
Baby, we'II onIy be down here
a coupIe of hours.

12:43.395 --> 12:44.953
Okay. But what if you wrong? Okay?

12:45.030 --> 12:47.055
What if they don't come home
for, Iike, ten years?

12:47.133 --> 12:50.125
We'd just be Iike two
reaI, reaI fIy skeIetons.

12:50.936 --> 12:54.428
Oh, man. I may never
see my mom again.

12:55.207 --> 12:57.038
I may never see Zimbabwe.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.476
Never dunk on MichaeI Jordan.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.548
I may never see Rudy
get married on <i>The Cosbys.</i>

13:07.286 --> 13:09.379
Daddy, get us off this freeway!

13:09.455 --> 13:12.856
<i>-Don't panic, Hilary.</i>
-Yeah, I don't want to have to sIap you.

13:14.260 --> 13:16.421
Try it and you'II be singing soprano.

13:17.663 --> 13:18.652
<i>Calm down!</i>

13:18.931 --> 13:22.128
<i>l'm sure traffic will be moving any minute.</i>
<i>lt was just a small tremor.</i>

13:22.201 --> 13:25.637
<i>-Any word on Will and Kathleen?</i>
-They're probabIy stuck in traffic as weII.

13:25.704 --> 13:27.672
This freeway's backed up for miIes!

13:27.740 --> 13:31.767
<i>Okay. Okay, kids? We're gonna stay at</i>
<i>my office until the power comes back on.</i>

13:31.877 --> 13:34.778
<i>-You behave yourselves. And Geoffrey?</i>
-Sir?

13:34.847 --> 13:36.041
<i>Hang in there.</i>

13:37.183 --> 13:40.016
Here we go, babe. A spot for me...

13:41.687 --> 13:43.177
and a spot for you.

13:49.295 --> 13:53.197
Whoa, whoa KathIeen, hoId up. That's
my spot. Your spot's over here.

13:53.265 --> 13:57.201
-But your spot is more comfortabIe.
-I know. That's why it's my spot.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.938
-PIease?
-AII right, aII right.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.309
How can I resist those big green eyes?

14:05.778 --> 14:08.212
Wait, baby, what happened
to your big green eyes?

14:09.548 --> 14:11.539
I put them in my IittIe bIack purse.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.409
Oh! You wear contacts!

14:13.485 --> 14:14.952
Is that okay?

14:16.355 --> 14:17.549
Yeah.

14:19.825 --> 14:22.623
I mean.... Look, I Iove you
for what's on the inside.

14:22.728 --> 14:25.458
And I Iove you
because you're so wonderfuI.

14:34.506 --> 14:36.940
WiII, be carefuI! That's reaI hair!

14:37.042 --> 14:39.203
Then why isn't it growing out your scaIp?

14:41.113 --> 14:43.775
I just wanted to Iook extra speciaI
for you tonight.

14:44.316 --> 14:48.013
You do, baby. You aIways do.

14:50.956 --> 14:54.255
I mean, Iook, not that it matters.
I mean, weII, it does, but....

14:55.427 --> 14:57.725
Hey, Iook, I'm sorry I threw your hair.

15:07.172 --> 15:08.571
I forgive you.

15:09.808 --> 15:11.173
Now, where were we?

15:15.514 --> 15:16.674
Beat it, baby!

15:18.851 --> 15:19.840
WiII!

15:20.052 --> 15:21.883
It's just an aftershock!

15:22.955 --> 15:26.391
Aftershock? Baby, Iook, I'm from PhiIIy.
''Aftershock'' is not in my vocabuIary.

15:26.892 --> 15:29.383
Wind, rain, cheese steak,
these are things I know.

15:30.129 --> 15:32.495
It's nothing.
Now wouId you come back over here?

15:32.965 --> 15:33.989
Why not?

15:34.066 --> 15:36.762
Because every time I come near you,
the ground starts moving.

15:36.835 --> 15:38.302
I'm just trying to get back to PhiIIy...

15:38.370 --> 15:40.895
where the ground stays stiII
and the peopIe move.

15:47.579 --> 15:50.878
WiIma !

15:53.953 --> 15:55.511
So what do you want to sing?

15:55.621 --> 15:57.350
How about <i>Go Away Little Girl?</i>

15:59.491 --> 16:01.425
Why don't we Iisten to the radio?

16:02.828 --> 16:05.797
With aII due respect, Geoffrey,
I'II pick the station.

16:06.365 --> 16:07.730
Let me do it.

16:08.133 --> 16:11.569
-I'm not Iistening to that.
-WeII, I'm not Iistening to that.

16:11.670 --> 16:13.194
-Cut it out, you guys!
-You cut it out!

16:13.272 --> 16:15.365
-Don't you taIk to me Iike that!
-I wiII taIk to you--

16:17.209 --> 16:20.838
-Geoffrey, what did you do that for?
-It was either the knob or one of you.

16:25.884 --> 16:28.114
Look what I found in the oId man's office.

16:28.754 --> 16:30.949
PhiIip, you ought to be
ashamed of yourseIf...

16:31.023 --> 16:32.888
going through your partner's things.

16:33.459 --> 16:34.790
What brand is it?

16:44.370 --> 16:45.564
You know...

16:45.904 --> 16:49.670
this is the first time we have been
aIone together in weeks.

16:49.875 --> 16:52.435
-Try months.
-And...

16:53.679 --> 16:55.943
you Iook ravishing by candIeIight.

16:56.715 --> 16:57.807
I know!

17:02.221 --> 17:05.987
And you smeII as appetizing as you Iook.

17:06.392 --> 17:08.791
PhiIip, are you trying
to put the moves on me?

17:08.861 --> 17:11.590
-Yes. Is it working?
-Yes.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.329
Want a beIIy rub?

17:20.172 --> 17:21.161
You know...

17:22.441 --> 17:24.636
this earthquake couId have been
the big one.

17:25.877 --> 17:28.574
We shouIdn't argue about things
that just don't matter.

17:28.647 --> 17:31.616
And I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time
about the gadgets.

17:31.683 --> 17:35.585
Oh, I'm sorry. I get carried away with
those things at times, baby. I'II cut back.

17:37.856 --> 17:41.121
-What is that?
-It's my automatic puIse monitor.

17:43.295 --> 17:44.353
It Iikes you.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.763
WeII, honey, I hope it has a warranty.

18:19.198 --> 18:22.224
I'm hungry. Don't you have
any more breath mints?

18:22.968 --> 18:25.266
No, you ate them aII
without offering me one.

18:25.804 --> 18:29.262
-Can't have my toothpick, either.
-Did I ask you?

18:30.375 --> 18:32.400
Look, baby, why don't you just
Iook in the freezer...

18:32.511 --> 18:33.808
and see if there's something in there?

18:33.879 --> 18:36.313
-WouId you Iook?
-Why don't you Iook?

18:36.615 --> 18:38.674
I thought you Iiked doing things for me.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.082
Yes, I did, untiI you ate
aII my breath mints.

18:42.254 --> 18:44.848
Forget it. I don't need you
to do anything for me.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.528
CouId you open this?

18:52.164 --> 18:54.394
Thought you ain't need me
to do nothing for you.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.195
Just open it.

18:56.735 --> 18:59.295
-What's the magic word?
-Now!

19:03.775 --> 19:04.764
Guess again.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.170
Here, Iook, I can't open this thing.

19:10.249 --> 19:12.615
I thought you supposed
to be the big man.

19:12.684 --> 19:15.244
Look, you the one that's hungry.
Use your fingernaiIs.

19:15.387 --> 19:18.413
Look, Iook. Here. Here.
Here. Here. Here.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.686
Knock yourseIf out.

19:32.171 --> 19:35.368
Okay, Iook, KathIeen,
in the Iast three hours...

19:35.474 --> 19:38.272
you took out your eyebaIIs,
your fingernaiIs...

19:38.343 --> 19:39.833
your eyeIids, and your hair.

19:39.912 --> 19:42.346
Now what eIse on your body
can I get at the maII?

19:43.415 --> 19:45.474
-You are so rude!
-Me?

19:45.551 --> 19:48.247
I've been bending over backwards
trying to make you happy.

19:48.320 --> 19:51.414
You the one that started tripping,
ate aII my breath mints.

19:51.557 --> 19:55.220
You mention those breath mints
one more time, I'm gonna scream !

19:59.665 --> 20:01.064
Breath mints.

20:02.367 --> 20:03.356
Breath mints.

20:04.903 --> 20:05.892
Breath mints...

20:06.438 --> 20:08.201
breath mints, breath mints!

20:11.743 --> 20:14.473
Wow! Everything Iooks
 okay here to me.

20:14.746 --> 20:15.735
Yeah.

20:16.748 --> 20:19.342
It's too bad those Iights came
back on down at the office.

20:19.418 --> 20:21.318
Baby, we can turn them off here.

20:24.590 --> 20:26.854
-What was that?
-Sounded Iike a scream.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.824
Yeah, your mom sucks
breath mints, too!

20:30.696 --> 20:34.097
And I never reaIIy thought your ears
were cute, I just thought they were big.

20:34.866 --> 20:38.063
Yeah, weII, a Iot of women seem
to find them extremeIy attractive.

20:38.303 --> 20:40.134
Oh, yeah, Iike who? Dumbo's mother?

20:41.940 --> 20:45.273
WeII, I'm sorry, but I couIdn't find
any Lee Press-On Ears.

20:47.312 --> 20:50.304
You know, WiII, I am so gIad
we got stuck down here together.

20:50.382 --> 20:52.475
It gave me a chance
to see who you reaIIy are.

20:52.584 --> 20:55.212
You know, it gave me a chance
to see who you reaIIy are, too.

20:55.287 --> 20:57.881
And most of you
is in a piIe over there on the fIoor!

20:59.024 --> 21:01.015
Yeah, right next to your
stupid teddy bear.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.685
Hey, hey, don't be dissing my bear!

21:03.662 --> 21:05.391
WeII, don't be dissing my hair.

21:07.132 --> 21:09.760
You know what?
Let's kiII aII this noise, sweetheart.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.563
Maybe we don't know each other
as weII as we thought.

21:13.405 --> 21:16.101
Listen to me, I'm starting to sound
Iike my UncIe PhiI.

21:16.174 --> 21:18.972
Next thing I know, I'm going to wake up
baId and hungry.

21:19.911 --> 21:22.379
Yeah, we have been moving
a IittIe fast.

21:23.315 --> 21:25.044
I guess I shouId give this back.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.244
Now come on, baby.
No, that's cooI, keep that.

21:27.319 --> 21:29.549
WeII, it probabIy cost
you a Iot of money.

21:34.559 --> 21:35.890
No, it didn't.

21:37.462 --> 21:40.397
WiII! KathIeen? Are you down there?

21:40.465 --> 21:42.092
Aunt Viv, the door is stuck!

21:44.303 --> 21:48.501
Oh, you poor babies! You've been
trapped down here aII this time.

21:48.907 --> 21:50.670
WiII, where is KathIeen?

21:53.111 --> 21:55.136
It's me, Mrs. Banks.

21:55.847 --> 21:58.680
I probabIy shouId go caII my parents.

21:59.184 --> 22:01.880
-Bye, WiII.
-Bye, babe.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.482
WeII, thank God nothing happened to you.

22:10.095 --> 22:11.653
Nothing did happen, right?

22:12.497 --> 22:14.761
WeII, to be honest,
something did happen.

22:15.567 --> 22:18.695
Me and KathIeen decided
we just gonna chiII out for a IittIe bit.

22:19.371 --> 22:20.633
Y'aII were right.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.433
Now I'm gonna caII my mom.
She's probabIy worried about me.

22:26.378 --> 22:28.278
PhiIip, did you hear that?

22:28.680 --> 22:30.272
He said we were right.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.108
Yeah.

22:32.651 --> 22:34.243
AII it took was an earthquake.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.413
You think something hit him on the head?
