isn't good for you either.

05:50.834 --> 05:53.185

Some kind of medical device.

05:53.336 --> 05:55.412

05:55.430 --> 05:58.482

Uh, that looks
like a pneumatic pump

06:07.759 --> 06:08.700
for an artificial heart.

06:08.927 --> 06:09.943
It sends air through the tubes

06:10.037 --> 06:11.761
to power an implant
in her chest.

06:11.855 --> 06:15.356
I don't think it's functioning.
She just lost consciousness.

06:16.952 --> 06:19.269
-Must be damaged.
-Should I start CPR?

No. The implant is made
of hard plastic.

<i> Compressions will only</i>
<i> jam it into her sternum.</i>

06:22.866 --> 06:24.124

Another one?

She wouldn't go without

10:44.293 --> 10:45.368
(gasps)

10:45.461 --> 10:48.146
She's breathing.

10:50.876 --> 10:53.693
(exhales)

10:55.638 --> 10:58.156
Well, they say any landing
you can walk away from

10:58.233 --> 10:59.883
is a good landing.

10:59.976 --> 11:01.809
Hey, you're alive.
(chuckles)

11:01.828 --> 11:03.386
You, too.

11:03.405 --> 11:04.996
(chuckles)

11:06.649 --> 11:10.484
Hey, so, how they gonna get
the rest of that thing down?

11:10.504 --> 11:13.088
Not our problem.

11:16.418 --> 11:17.583
Is she okay?

11:17.678 --> 11:19.402
She's doing fine.

11:19.495 --> 11:21.404
Mom?

11:21.497 --> 11:24.073
You're gonna be okay.
Okay, I'll see you there.

11:24.092 --> 11:26.559
It's okay.

11:27.913 --> 11:29.503
How was crowd control, Sergeant?

11:29.523 --> 11:33.191
Got called in to do an emergency
heart transplant instead.

11:33.342 --> 11:35.176
(scoffs)
Well, you win.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.511
Eh, who's keeping score?

11:37.531 --> 11:39.406
(both laugh)

11:47.933 --> 11:49.040
BOBBY:
What did the doctor say?

11:49.192 --> 11:50.858
<i> I'm definitely broken.</i>

11:50.877 --> 11:52.544
How'd you break your foot
off-duty?

11:52.695 --> 11:54.604
<i> HEN:</i>
<i> Yeah, we thought you were</i>
<i> going to that</i>

11:54.622 --> 11:55.621
<i> family reunion weekend.</i>

11:55.774 --> 11:57.106
Yeah. That's how I broke it.

11:57.125 --> 11:59.217
We were playing football,
I got shoved from behind,

11:59.444 --> 12:00.944
and I just rolled my ankle.

12:00.962 --> 12:03.388
HEN AND CHIMNEY:
Avulsion fracture
of the fifth metatarsal.

12:03.615 --> 12:04.556
<i> Yeah, what they said.</i>

12:04.707 --> 12:06.282
Happens a lot when
you roll your ankle.

12:06.301 --> 12:08.560
Wait, so-so, one of your
brothers pushed you from behind?

12:08.711 --> 12:09.969
My niece Delilah.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.637
<i>She's seven and kind of vicious.</i>

12:11.790 --> 12:13.139
<i> She's my favorite.</i>

12:13.233 --> 12:14.899
So we probably won't see you
for a few weeks, then?

12:15.051 --> 12:17.551
<i> Doctor says between four</i>
<i> and six weeks.</i>

12:17.645 --> 12:20.021
<i> I am really sorry, Cap.</i>

12:20.131 --> 12:21.647
<i> I hope I didn't ruin</i>
<i> your honeymoon.</i>

12:21.800 --> 12:23.241
Don't worry about it, I'll find
somebody else to cover.

12:23.392 --> 12:25.468
You just let us know
if you need anything.

12:25.561 --> 12:27.228
All right, gang,
let's get ready to

12:27.247 --> 12:29.664
turn it over to B-shift.

12:31.493 --> 12:32.809
Uh, hey, hey, Cap.

12:32.902 --> 12:36.162
Um, wh-what did Lucy mean
about ruining your trip?

12:36.314 --> 12:39.240
I was gonna have her
fill in for me when I was gone.

12:40.001 --> 12:42.819
Uh, you were gonna make Lucy
interim captain?

12:42.912 --> 12:46.247
-She, she hasn't even
been here that long.
-Not the 118,

12:46.266 --> 12:47.932
but she's been a firefighter
for almost ten years.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.342
She's more than qualified.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.177
Well, yeah,
but o-other people here

12:51.329 --> 12:52.437
are also qualified.

12:52.664 --> 12:54.939
Hey, I appreciate the vote
of confidence, kid,

12:55.166 --> 12:56.441
but I don't need to pressure
Cap into asking me.

12:56.592 --> 12:58.501
I'd like to pressure him
into not asking you.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.686
BOBBY:
Oh, you want to be
interim captain again?

13:00.855 --> 13:02.113
Because the last time
you did it,

13:02.265 --> 13:03.506
I recall the words
"never again."

13:03.599 --> 13:06.600
-That was from the rest of us.
-(laughs)

13:06.694 --> 13:07.844
Thanks, Cap.
But never again.

13:07.862 --> 13:10.246
It is nice to be asked, though.

13:12.275 --> 13:14.441
So it doesn't bother you?

13:15.111 --> 13:17.778
That Bobby didn't even
consider either one of us

13:17.798 --> 13:18.797
for interim captain?

13:19.024 --> 13:21.207
Not really.
Just got back to the 118.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.543
-Clearly it's bothering you.
-Listen,

13:23.695 --> 13:25.528
don't get me wrong,
I think Lucy is whatever.

13:25.663 --> 13:27.288
You know, she's great,
but she's out.

13:27.382 --> 13:28.622
You know,
I think it's weird that

13:28.716 --> 13:30.700
he's struggling to pick
a replacement when he has

13:30.793 --> 13:32.368
so many other excellent options

13:32.461 --> 13:34.461
-right under his nose.
-Like you?

13:34.481 --> 13:36.314
It's like he's choosing
not to see them

13:36.541 --> 13:38.391
and everything they have
to offer.

13:38.543 --> 13:41.152
Time. Aw, you'll win next time.

13:41.304 --> 13:43.396
What are you offering?

13:43.548 --> 13:46.324
Right now,
Bobby's famous lasagna.

13:46.475 --> 13:51.037
Six types of cheese,
cooked to perfection.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.723
Okay, very hot.

13:53.741 --> 13:55.834
Don't use your hands.

13:55.985 --> 13:57.226
It does look good.

13:57.320 --> 13:58.744
Smells really good, too.

13:58.897 --> 14:00.563
And it only took me
three tries to get it right.

14:00.582 --> 14:02.823
I'm not sure you get
three tries on a job.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.585
-At least not without
a significant body count.
-I just want to know

14:05.679 --> 14:07.995
what these other candidates have
that apparently I don't.

14:08.164 --> 14:11.516
CHRISTOPHER:
Buck, you don't even
have a couch.

14:14.003 --> 14:15.186
(Eddie laughs)

14:15.338 --> 14:16.596
-Uh...
-Boom!

14:16.764 --> 14:18.672
...so what does that have to do
with being fire captain?

14:18.692 --> 14:21.100
-It's weird.
-(Eddie snickers)

14:21.252 --> 14:23.769
My last two couches
came with girlfriends.

14:23.922 --> 14:26.439
I think you mean
your last two girlfriends

14:26.533 --> 14:28.408
came with couches.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.444
Taylor moved out, what,
four months ago, Buck?

14:31.596 --> 14:33.020
You could have replaced
the couch by now.

14:33.039 --> 14:36.616
Uh, well, maybe I don't want
to pick the wrong couch again.

14:36.692 --> 14:39.085
Maybe that's how Bobby feels
about interim captain.

14:41.864 --> 14:43.864
-(both laughing)
-CHIMNEY: Hey.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.699
Sorry to bust in
on your night off.

14:45.777 --> 14:47.627
No worries.
What happened?

14:47.779 --> 14:50.796
Well, we were getting ready
for bed, we heard rain.

14:50.891 --> 14:53.040
Found out it was raining
in my kitchen.

14:53.134 --> 14:54.559
-Oh. What did your landlord say?
-He's with the plumber
right now.

14:54.786 --> 14:57.120
-Hopefully it'll be an easy fix.
-(Chimney exhales sharply)

14:57.138 --> 15:01.215
-Calling a plumber at 9:00
on a Saturday night?
-Daddy.

15:01.309 --> 15:03.192
Can you say "double overtime"?

15:04.404 --> 15:05.904
Oh, my God, did you have plans?

15:06.131 --> 15:07.572
No, I just ordered in.
I was gonna finish

15:07.723 --> 15:10.909
that movie we started watching
last week. Here we go.

15:11.060 --> 15:12.577
Whoa. Without me?

15:12.728 --> 15:15.396
Maddie, you fell asleep
watching it. Twice.

15:15.490 --> 15:17.231
Okay, well, maybe third time's
the charm.

15:17.325 --> 15:19.584
-(Chimney laughs)
-(phone chiming)

15:19.735 --> 15:21.327
-Is that the landlord?
-Yeah.

15:21.479 --> 15:22.812
I should have water by tomorrow.

15:22.830 --> 15:25.572
-(phone chiming)
-Or Wednesday.

15:25.667 --> 15:26.649
Sounds like your landlord needs

15:26.651 --> 15:27.984
to find a better plumber.

15:28.153 --> 15:29.576
Yeah. And I'm gonna need
a hotel room because

15:29.596 --> 15:31.429
I can't go four days
without running water.

15:32.657 --> 15:36.083
You know who else has
running water? Me.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.252
Why don't you just stay here?
I'll crash on the couch.

15:38.346 --> 15:39.679
You girls can have the bedroom.

15:39.831 --> 15:42.273
-Yeah, I wouldn't want
to impose.
-Maddie...

15:42.425 --> 15:44.667
we're still family, hmm?
That's what we do.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.110
We look out for each other.

15:46.262 --> 15:47.987
Don't we, Baby Jee?

15:50.692 --> 15:51.866
All right.

15:53.011 --> 15:55.011
Now, remember
to keep your head down.

15:55.029 --> 15:56.679
-I know.
-Keep that left arm straight.

15:56.681 --> 15:58.848
-I know.
-Just pretend you're
swinging in a barrel.

15:58.866 --> 16:00.774
Okay, Dad, what does that
even mean?

16:00.794 --> 16:03.277
All right. It means
you want to keep

16:03.296 --> 16:05.371
all your weight
back on your right foot.

16:05.523 --> 16:07.373
-Minimize your hip turn
when you swing.
-(wood chipper rumbling)

16:07.525 --> 16:08.708
Keep your head down,
looking at the ball.

16:08.876 --> 16:10.969
-Wait, what?
-You want to keep
your weight back,

16:11.196 --> 16:12.211
limiting your-your...

16:12.305 --> 16:15.047
-Wait, I...
-(rumbling)

16:15.200 --> 16:16.532
Hey. Hey, guys!

16:16.625 --> 16:20.228
Do you mind?
We-We're trying to hit here.

16:22.631 --> 16:24.965
-(shuts off)
-ELTON: You know what?

16:24.985 --> 16:27.151
Forget it.
I'll shut up, just do

16:27.303 --> 16:28.878
whatever feels natural. But...

16:28.896 --> 16:31.638
I'm gonna give you
a little good luck charm.
(chuckles)

16:31.733 --> 16:33.899
Your lucky ball?
Come on, Dad.

16:34.052 --> 16:35.218
Don't put more pressure
on me.

16:35.236 --> 16:37.036
Ah, come on.
You can do it.

16:49.825 --> 16:50.657
(clangs)

16:50.752 --> 16:52.493
Oh, I hate this stupid game.

16:52.587 --> 16:55.996
I didn't see it come down,
but I'm sure we'll find it.

16:56.090 --> 16:57.423
You know, there's another thing
that could be

16:57.517 --> 16:58.924
affecting your swing.

16:59.019 --> 17:01.001
That new hardware
on your left hand.

17:01.095 --> 17:02.578
My wedding ring?

17:02.638 --> 17:03.670
Dad, don't even start.

17:03.765 --> 17:05.339
Vito and I are married now

17:05.358 --> 17:06.949
whether you like it or not.

17:07.009 --> 17:08.008
We're very happy, I might add.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.009
I'm not talking about

17:09.029 --> 17:10.436
your shotgun wedding.

17:10.588 --> 17:13.939
Only that you should try wearing
a rubber wedding band

17:14.092 --> 17:15.107
on the course like I do.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.108
You never used to play this bad

17:16.261 --> 17:17.351
when you and Joey were dating.

17:17.370 --> 17:18.277
Yes, I did.

17:18.429 --> 17:19.612
You just didn't care because

17:19.706 --> 17:20.780
you and Joey would always

17:20.856 --> 17:22.598
team up and "go low"
or whatever.

17:22.617 --> 17:24.876
Half the time
I'd quit at the turn,

17:25.103 --> 17:27.086
and you barely seemed
to notice.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.548
ELTON:
Man, that Joey was
one hell of a putter.

17:30.699 --> 17:32.366
Great on the fairway, too.

17:32.385 --> 17:35.595
-You sure he wasn't the one?
-Yes.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.878
(wood chipper starts)

17:44.898 --> 17:47.123
(Leon screaming)

17:47.216 --> 17:48.983
-God!
-Aah!

17:50.978 --> 17:51.977
Are you okay?

17:52.054 --> 17:55.131
Yeah. I think so.

17:55.149 --> 17:56.991
That ring saved my hand.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.505
-(sirens wailing)
-(horn honks)

18:13.927 --> 18:15.501
Dispatch,
118 is at the golf course.

18:15.653 --> 18:17.153
Victim in sight.

18:17.171 --> 18:18.579
How long has he been down?

18:18.673 --> 18:20.323
We heard there was a shooting.
I got this one, Cap.

18:20.341 --> 18:21.841
Uh, have you recovered
the weapon?

18:21.993 --> 18:23.826
Negative. It's still embedded
in the victim's chest.

18:23.845 --> 18:25.177
BUCK:
Okay, we better double-time it.

18:25.330 --> 18:26.920
You guys know what to do.
Let's go, let's go, come on.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.439
Hang in there, Dad.
Help is here.

18:28.591 --> 18:30.424
BOBBY:
Excuse me, sir,
can you step back?

18:30.518 --> 18:31.776
My team is gonna take a look
at your dad.

18:32.003 --> 18:33.352
I'll take a look at that hand.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.113
Let's move back here,
give them some space.

18:35.264 --> 18:37.006
EDDIE:
I got you, sir, I got you.

18:37.099 --> 18:38.765
(Elton groaning)

18:38.843 --> 18:41.177
HEN:
Looks like we got a keyhole
thoracic entry wound

18:41.270 --> 18:42.769
on the right sternum.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.363
Bleeding is steady,
but from the lack of spurting,

18:44.515 --> 18:46.607
looks like it missed the aorta.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.442
(Elton groans)

18:48.461 --> 18:50.686
EDDIE:
Heart rate is 165 BPM.

18:50.705 --> 18:53.113
Systolic BP is 98,

18:53.133 --> 18:55.040
indicating the patient
was likely struck by

18:55.193 --> 18:56.283
a large-caliber round.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.951
What was your dad shot with?

18:57.971 --> 18:58.970
My tungsten wedding ring.

18:59.197 --> 19:00.304
Never saw that in combat.

19:00.531 --> 19:02.289
Based on his bilateral
breathing,

19:02.308 --> 19:03.699
it looks like his ribs
stopped the ring

19:03.792 --> 19:05.050
from puncturing the lung.

19:05.127 --> 19:07.219
Preparing hemostatic bandaging
to pack the wound.

19:07.372 --> 19:09.730
Running morphine and fluids.

19:10.892 --> 19:12.224
How exactly did this happen?

19:12.377 --> 19:14.152
I was trying to fish a ball
out of the wood chipper,

19:14.320 --> 19:16.154
but my hand got sucked
into the blade.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.381
My ring jammed it long enough
for my hand to slide out.

19:18.399 --> 19:20.140
But then the ring just
went through.

19:20.234 --> 19:23.494
Don't worry, Cap, securing
the perimeter. I'm on it.

19:23.721 --> 19:25.404
CHIMNEY:
Well, your five fingers
are still intact.

19:25.556 --> 19:26.831
None of them appear
to be broken, so I guess

19:26.982 --> 19:28.482
you're very fortunate
you're not single.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.893
All right, let's get him
on a gurney and transport.

19:30.986 --> 19:32.170
Doctors should be able
to remove

19:32.321 --> 19:35.356
the offending ring
at the hospital.

19:35.358 --> 19:37.900
I'm gonna call Mom and tell her
to meet us at the hospital.

19:37.993 --> 19:40.678
Oh, and tell Joey
I'm not gonna make it

19:40.905 --> 19:42.180
to the driving range tonight.

19:42.407 --> 19:45.683
You're seriously still playing
golf with my ex-boyfriend?

19:45.910 --> 19:47.685
He's like the son I never had.

19:47.836 --> 19:50.188
The one who can play golf.

19:51.357 --> 19:54.934
Being a 911 dispatcher
will be challenging

19:55.028 --> 19:58.196
and exhausting, and can
take an emotional toll.

19:58.423 --> 20:01.590
The people who call are scared,
in need,

20:01.609 --> 20:04.351
and we are their lifeline.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.037
But it's also rewarding.

20:06.264 --> 20:09.707
Calling us is probably the
scariest moment of their lives.

20:09.934 --> 20:13.602
But if we do our jobs right
and help arrives in time

20:13.696 --> 20:15.046
and we get a little lucky,

20:15.273 --> 20:16.530
then maybe it doesn't have to be

20:16.549 --> 20:19.258
the worst moment
of their lives.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.202
She nails it every time.

20:22.296 --> 20:24.780
-Do you have goose bumps?
-Don't you?

20:24.799 --> 20:27.116
A new call center,
a new team of dispatchers,

20:27.209 --> 20:30.119
and Chimney asking you
to move back in with him.

20:30.137 --> 20:31.712
Everything's returning
to normal around here.

20:31.731 --> 20:32.955
I wouldn't go that far.

20:33.048 --> 20:34.290
He did not ask me
to move back in.

20:34.459 --> 20:35.716
I'm just staying with him
for a few days.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.811
-Or forever.
-It's not like that.

20:38.887 --> 20:40.463
Why not?

20:40.556 --> 20:41.814
You clearly still
love each other.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.390
Just get back together already.

20:43.409 --> 20:46.302
What if he's not ready
for that? You know?

20:46.395 --> 20:48.654
I know that he loves me,
I just don't know

20:48.806 --> 20:50.081
if he wants to be with me.

20:50.308 --> 20:52.825
You can't keep playing
these guessing games, Maddie.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.311
If you can't figure out
what he wants,

20:55.329 --> 20:58.256
maybe you should tell him
what you want.

21:03.078 --> 21:06.655
MAY:
Wow, they all look so... young.

21:06.674 --> 21:09.825
-These are your future
college roommates?
-Yeah.

21:09.918 --> 21:10.993
But when they see me walk in,

21:10.995 --> 21:12.177
they're gonna think
I'm their R.A.

21:12.330 --> 21:14.330
Are you having second thoughts?

21:14.348 --> 21:18.501
I mean, I said I wanted
the full college experience,

21:18.594 --> 21:20.019
-and here it is.
-Mm-hmm.

21:20.171 --> 21:21.094
Now, I'm sure I'll adjust.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.855
I mean, I have to, right?

21:23.007 --> 21:24.356
It's not like I can
go back to my job

21:24.450 --> 21:26.175
or my apartment
or all the other things

21:26.268 --> 21:28.769
I gave up to be roomed
with three high school girls

21:28.863 --> 21:32.456
that were randomly selected
for me by a computer.

21:33.942 --> 21:36.869
I'll be fine.
I'll be fine. Okay.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.537
-I'll be fine.
-It's going to be an adventure.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.356
-Enjoy it.
-Yes.

21:40.374 --> 21:43.801
All right, what do you think?

21:43.952 --> 21:45.303
MAY:
That you're a mustache away

21:45.454 --> 21:47.471
from giving serious
<i> Magnum P.I.</i> vibes.

21:47.698 --> 21:48.881
-(chuckles)
-Hey, I'm in full
cruise mode here.

21:49.033 --> 21:51.142
I got to make sure
my resort wear is on par

21:51.293 --> 21:52.459
with the competition.

21:52.478 --> 21:53.811
Why don't you bring
both of them?

21:53.962 --> 21:55.387
When else would you
get a chance

21:55.540 --> 21:57.315
-to wear those at home?
-Well, I would,

21:57.466 --> 21:59.708
but I already committed
to one small roller bag.

21:59.727 --> 22:01.319
Well, how many bags
are you bringing, Mom?

22:01.470 --> 22:03.712
-More than one.
-Uh-huh, and I have accounted
for that.

22:03.731 --> 22:07.216
-Our stateroom is exactly
330 square feet...
-Oh, my.

22:07.234 --> 22:08.642
...but the closet's only 25.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.219
I don't want us stepping over
our bags the whole time.

22:10.237 --> 22:12.237
ATHENA:
330 square feet?

22:12.390 --> 22:13.739
I mean, let me guess.

22:13.891 --> 22:16.225
That's already been logged in
to the cruise spreadsheet?

22:16.243 --> 22:17.317
Right next to the
dinner specials

22:17.337 --> 22:18.744
and the daily activities.

22:18.896 --> 22:20.729
And I still need you to sign off
on some of my selections

22:20.898 --> 22:22.064
so we can lock those down.

22:22.157 --> 22:23.916
I told you I'm good
with the branzino.

22:24.068 --> 22:25.401
-Right.
-I just don't see why

22:25.419 --> 22:28.346
I would have to jump off
of a perfectly good boat

22:28.497 --> 22:29.572
for no reason.

22:29.590 --> 22:31.998
It's called snorkeling,
and it's fun.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.909
It's a whole nother world
down there.

22:33.928 --> 22:36.687
I'm more than happy
with the one I'm in.

22:38.006 --> 22:39.023
Which one?

22:39.250 --> 22:41.508
The shirt on the right.

22:41.527 --> 22:42.434
Done.

22:42.587 --> 22:43.694
(chuckles)

22:43.846 --> 22:46.012
Looks like you're gonna have
an adventure, too.

22:46.107 --> 22:48.014
(May laughs)

22:48.183 --> 22:49.608
(upbeat fanfare playing)

22:49.702 --> 22:52.444
ROD BILLINGS (over bullhorn):
Welcome to Rod Billings Cars

22:52.538 --> 22:56.356
and the annual "touch a car,
win a car" contest.

22:56.376 --> 22:58.767
The rules are very simple.

22:58.786 --> 23:02.696
One hand must be touching
a car at all times.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.030
No exceptions.

23:04.125 --> 23:09.202
Last one standing drives home
in this beauty. Huh?

23:09.296 --> 23:13.891
Now, who's ready
to touch a car?

23:14.042 --> 23:15.559
ALL:
Win a car!

23:15.786 --> 23:17.878
Let the games begin.

(crowd cheering)

23:22.735 --> 23:24.985
Yeah!

23:27.298 --> 23:30.074
ALL:
Win a car. Win a car.

23:30.225 --> 23:32.134

25:10.901 --> 25:13.252
We got a call about an injured--

25:13.346 --> 25:17.330
Hey, how long have these people
been standing out here?

25:17.350 --> 25:19.666
-28 hours.
-Uh, is that even legal?

25:19.685 --> 25:20.926
Let's take a listen.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.645
(panting)

25:26.508 --> 25:28.433
Ma'am, when's the last time
you had any water?

25:28.528 --> 25:29.585
Two days.

25:29.754 --> 25:31.937
Been trying not to drink
that much because

25:32.031 --> 25:33.589
water equals pee,

25:33.607 --> 25:35.090
and pee equals losing.

25:35.109 --> 25:36.700
And I need this car.

25:36.852 --> 25:38.518
Well, based on your lower back
pain and what sounded like fluid

25:38.687 --> 25:40.429
in your lungs,
I'm guessing you're suffering

25:40.522 --> 25:42.614
from acute kidney failure.
Not to mention you probably

25:42.767 --> 25:45.267
-damaged your bladder.
-Look, I need to keep one hand

25:45.360 --> 25:47.211
on this car at all times.
Can't you run

25:47.362 --> 25:50.214
-an IV in the other arm
or something?
-(chuckles): Okay...

25:50.365 --> 25:52.532
How you feeling, sir?
I can't imagine

25:52.626 --> 25:53.942
it'd be easy
being out in the sun

25:53.961 --> 25:55.702
-going on two days.
-I'm doing fine.

25:55.796 --> 25:58.130
I could go a whole nother day.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.558
-(chuckles)
-REMI: Me, too.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.896
Cap, we got to do something.
She's refusing to leave.

26:06.123 --> 26:08.123
My guy won't budge either.
He's in it to win it.

26:08.142 --> 26:09.474
Okay, how about this competition

26:09.627 --> 26:11.068
gets paused
so they can get treatment?

26:11.219 --> 26:12.811
You can pick it up
in a day or two, maybe inside

26:12.963 --> 26:16.240
-so they're out of the elements?
-Sorry, but no can do.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.577
What do you think
people are gonna say

26:19.804 --> 26:21.561
when they find out a woman died
at your dealership?

26:21.655 --> 26:23.563
I am trying
to give you an out here.

26:23.657 --> 26:25.307
Rules are rules.

26:25.326 --> 26:27.067
Okay, and the rules are

26:27.086 --> 26:29.253
they have to keep one hand
on one part of the vehicle

26:29.480 --> 26:31.496
-at all times, right?
-That's right.

26:31.649 --> 26:33.982
-Okay, Buck?
-Oh, am I on it, Cap.

26:34.001 --> 26:35.575
Saws and jaws.

26:35.595 --> 26:37.352
"Saws"?

26:37.412 --> 26:39.671
You're not gonna cut
that lady's arm off, are you?

26:39.824 --> 26:42.324
I don't need to.
She just needs to keep her hand

26:42.343 --> 26:43.767
on some part of the vehicle
at all times.

26:43.994 --> 26:45.994
You didn't say
that part has to remain

26:46.088 --> 26:47.253
attached to the vehicle.

26:47.273 --> 26:48.439
You can't just
come in here and carve up

26:48.666 --> 26:50.423
-my inventory like that!
-Hey, "rules are rules."

26:50.443 --> 26:51.667
Oh, hey, more reporters.

26:51.685 --> 26:54.486
It's gonna play great
on the morning news.

26:57.432 --> 26:59.283
(saw buzzing)

27:08.202 --> 27:10.035
<i> They both win a car!</i>

27:10.187 --> 27:12.612

<i> at Billings Auto Emporium,</i>

27:12.632 --> 27:16.050

27:29.373 --> 27:31.231
(knocking)

27:33.544 --> 27:34.543
Athena?

27:34.561 --> 27:35.969
Wait, what time is it?

27:35.988 --> 27:38.046
3:15.

27:38.065 --> 27:39.398
(groans)

27:39.550 --> 27:41.975
Our lunch date was 2:00,
wasn't it?

27:41.994 --> 27:43.810
Yep. I figured

27:43.904 --> 27:46.889
you forgot, but after you
canceled the last few times,

27:46.982 --> 27:48.999
decided that I would force
the issue.

27:49.151 --> 27:52.394
Even brought you some tacos
from Don Rivera's.

27:52.563 --> 27:54.171
-Your favorite.
-Oh... (chuckles)

27:54.340 --> 27:55.655
Friend.

27:55.675 --> 27:58.158
I don't know whether
to lead with "I'm so sorry"

27:58.252 --> 28:00.402
or "Thank you, I'm starving."

28:00.495 --> 28:02.328
Ah, neither is necessary.

28:02.348 --> 28:03.847
I know how busy you've been

28:03.999 --> 28:06.666
with work, family
and medical school.

28:06.760 --> 28:08.260
-(scoffs)
-Oof.

28:08.412 --> 28:09.912
It's starting to feel like

28:09.930 --> 28:12.005
I'm the living example
of that whole

28:12.099 --> 28:14.692
"be careful what you wish for"
thing right now.

28:14.843 --> 28:17.769
I hear you have some big exams
coming up next week.

28:17.863 --> 28:19.029
End of year two.

28:19.181 --> 28:21.423
I used to think
they were exaggerating

28:21.442 --> 28:23.033
about how bad
the boards would be.

28:23.260 --> 28:25.093
Now I'm starting to think

28:25.112 --> 28:27.763
-that maybe they undersold it.
-(laughs)

28:27.781 --> 28:29.765
Oh, I know you must be feeling

28:29.858 --> 28:32.601
a lot of pressure.
Have you talked to David?

28:32.694 --> 28:34.436
I mean, he's been where you are.

28:34.455 --> 28:35.713
Is he coming back
from Haiti soon?

28:35.940 --> 28:38.382
Oh, it doesn't sound like it.
He, Michael and Harry

28:38.533 --> 28:40.275
have set up
a home base in Miami,

28:40.368 --> 28:41.719
and David commutes from there.

28:41.870 --> 28:44.279
-How do you feel about all that?
-(phone chimes)

28:44.298 --> 28:45.705
Now, you know I miss Harry.

28:45.725 --> 28:47.466
But he sounds happy.

28:47.560 --> 28:50.376
-That's what matters to me.
-All right, well, maybe

28:50.396 --> 28:52.378
-I will give David a call.
-(phone chiming)

28:52.473 --> 28:54.806
I just need to get
through these finals

28:54.900 --> 28:57.276
and then I can take a breath.

28:59.296 --> 29:00.386
Who is that texting you?

29:00.481 --> 29:02.889
Just some cruise update
from Bobby.

29:02.908 --> 29:05.609
I mean, he has been watching
this ship's activity calendar

29:05.761 --> 29:08.804
like it's the ball dropping
from Times Square on New Year's.

29:08.822 --> 29:11.397
What? I thought the whole point
of those things was

29:11.417 --> 29:14.251
-to unplug and relax.
-It is for me,

29:14.402 --> 29:16.587
but Bobby wants to keep busy.

29:16.738 --> 29:18.313
Six nights, seven days.

29:18.332 --> 29:20.499
11 bars.

29:20.651 --> 29:22.667
-Oh.
-I'm sure

29:22.820 --> 29:24.336
it's not
the easiest place in the world

29:24.430 --> 29:26.338
for someone
who's in the program.

29:26.432 --> 29:27.990
But he's trying
to show me a good time,

29:28.008 --> 29:30.750
so I don't mind
returning the favor.

29:30.770 --> 29:32.844
-(phone chimes)
-Oh.

29:32.938 --> 29:34.830
Oh, great.

29:34.848 --> 29:36.348
-An eco-tour?
-Listen.

29:36.442 --> 29:39.167
If that trip gets
to be too much,

29:39.261 --> 29:40.944
you could always hide
in the spa.

29:41.096 --> 29:42.595
If? Okay.

29:42.689 --> 29:45.690
(music playing)

29:45.785 --> 29:48.527
Huh, did not see that coming.

29:48.695 --> 29:49.953
-Ooh, what'd I miss?
-(scoffs)

29:50.030 --> 29:51.455
I missed everything.

29:51.682 --> 29:52.681
Again.

29:52.850 --> 29:55.700
Third time is
definitely not the charm.

29:55.795 --> 29:57.628
-I'm sorry.
-Don't worry about it.

29:57.779 --> 29:59.279
Why don't you just go to bed?

29:59.373 --> 30:00.705
Because I hate admitting defeat.

30:00.858 --> 30:02.782
And it's still really early.

30:02.802 --> 30:04.468
-Isn't it?
-(both laugh)

30:04.695 --> 30:06.028
You know, it's weird, the only
reason why I picked this movie

30:06.196 --> 30:07.712
is 'cause I thought
you would like it.

30:07.865 --> 30:09.381
I don't know. Maybe I just
don't have the patience

30:09.457 --> 30:10.882
for these movies anymore,
you know?

30:10.976 --> 30:13.368
Two people meet, you know that
they're gonna end up together.

30:13.370 --> 30:14.886
And then you have to watch 'em
bumble their way

30:15.039 --> 30:16.538
through stupid misunderstandings
for two hours.

30:16.631 --> 30:18.707
I don't know.
It's kind of annoying.

30:18.725 --> 30:20.484
So you'd rather your rom-coms

30:20.635 --> 30:22.486
have less "com."

30:22.713 --> 30:24.154
I don't know.

30:24.306 --> 30:26.381
I guess I would rather see

30:26.550 --> 30:29.475
two people overcome
real problems and...

30:29.495 --> 30:32.237
♪<i> I'm overzealous, when I'm</i>
<i> down, I get real down...</i> ♪

Chim?

31:41.291 --> 31:42.641
You fled your own apartment?

31:42.735 --> 31:45.644
-What? I had to get to work.
-Two hours early?

31:45.796 --> 31:48.238
You know how the morning after
can get kind of awkward?

31:48.390 --> 31:49.981
I just figured it might be
easier for me

31:50.134 --> 31:52.058
to not be there for it.
Is that so bad?

31:52.077 --> 31:53.559
Don't look at me.

31:53.654 --> 31:54.970
I once asked Shannon
to sneak out of my house

31:54.988 --> 31:56.638
so Christopher wouldn't see her
in my bed.

31:56.731 --> 31:58.248
(chuckles)
You see?

31:58.400 --> 32:00.809
Compared to that, I'm as
chivalrous as Sir Galahad.

32:00.827 --> 32:02.811
Or as delusional as Don Quixote.

32:02.829 --> 32:05.147
I don't understand. Isn't this
what you've been wanting?

32:05.165 --> 32:06.423
What the two of you
been working towards?

32:06.500 --> 32:08.667
It is, it just feels
like I'm waiting

32:08.761 --> 32:10.335
for...

32:10.429 --> 32:12.821
-something.
-Well, with Shannon, I tried

32:12.914 --> 32:15.157
to tell myself I was doing it
to protect Christopher.

32:15.175 --> 32:17.625
The truth is, I was just
doing it to protect myself.

32:17.678 --> 32:19.085
What's wrong with that?

32:19.104 --> 32:20.938
You didn't skip the morning
after conversation, Chim.

32:21.089 --> 32:22.497
You just delayed it.

32:22.516 --> 32:24.757
And you added a whole new
complicated layer.

32:24.851 --> 32:25.776
I had a one-night stand
with my ex.

32:25.927 --> 32:27.018
I don't know what the rules are.

32:27.171 --> 32:29.529
Maybe that's
what you need to find out.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.620
Whoa!

32:36.697 --> 32:39.105
-I am so sorry!
-That I bumped into you?
Don't be.

32:39.274 --> 32:40.457
-I-I'm...
-Maddie!

32:40.608 --> 32:42.033
Your class is sort of

32:42.235 --> 32:43.961
legend at the academy.

32:44.112 --> 32:46.521
A 7.1 earthquake your first day
on floor.

32:46.614 --> 32:47.689
I'm Noah.

32:47.691 --> 32:49.374
Uh, good to meet you, Noah.

32:49.451 --> 32:51.193
So, any tips for the newbie?

32:51.211 --> 32:53.286
(exhales)
Remember to breathe.

32:53.305 --> 32:54.863
(chuckles)
The person on the other end

32:54.881 --> 32:57.032
is already panicked
and they don't need you to be.

32:57.050 --> 32:58.200
Sounds easy.

32:58.218 --> 32:59.551
I'm pretty sure it isn't.

32:59.645 --> 33:02.479
It gets easier eventually.

33:10.230 --> 33:12.047
What's your name and where
are you calling from?

33:12.065 --> 33:14.216
My name is Kenyon and we live

33:14.234 --> 33:15.900
at 646 Ridgeline Court.

33:15.995 --> 33:17.719
<i> Hi, Kenyon. I'm Maddie.</i>

33:17.738 --> 33:19.663
-How old are you?
<i> -I'm 12.</i>

33:19.814 --> 33:20.813
<i> But my brother's only six.</i>

33:20.833 --> 33:22.557
My mom left me to look after him

33:22.576 --> 33:24.334
while she went to the grocery
store and now he's gone.

33:24.486 --> 33:26.486
Okay, start from the beginning.
What happened?

33:26.505 --> 33:29.414
We were playing hide-and-seek
and he just disappeared.

33:29.566 --> 33:30.582
Jeremy!

33:30.734 --> 33:32.417
What, do you think
maybe he's still hiding?

33:32.569 --> 33:34.327
<i> I don't know.</i>
<i> It's been a really long time.</i>

33:34.346 --> 33:35.512
<i> And I've looked everywhere.</i>

33:35.739 --> 33:37.163
I keep yelling his name,
and he always

33:37.257 --> 33:38.515
comes out
when he can tell I'm mad.

33:38.742 --> 33:40.242
-Jeremy!
<i> -Okay.</i>

33:40.335 --> 33:41.409
Usually we don't send the police

33:41.428 --> 33:43.002
until we know someone's missing.

33:43.096 --> 33:45.004
But I'm gonna send
an officer to you just in case.

33:45.098 --> 33:47.024
What if he ran away?

33:47.918 --> 33:49.175
Has he done that in the past?

33:49.194 --> 33:52.112
<i> No, but I used to</i>
<i> when I was his age.</i>

33:53.032 --> 33:55.073
"Used to"?

33:56.109 --> 33:57.868
-Why'd you stop?
<i> -My mom.</i>

33:58.095 --> 33:59.519
<i> She'd get so scared.</i>

33:59.538 --> 34:02.497
It took her a really long time
to stop worrying about me.

34:03.600 --> 34:04.933
Yeah, yeah.

34:04.951 --> 34:07.627
I bet it's hard to get
over being afraid like that.

34:09.623 --> 34:11.214
What are you afraid of?

34:11.366 --> 34:13.216
Uh, what?

34:13.368 --> 34:14.793
<i>Is there someplace in the house</i>

34:14.961 --> 34:16.720
<i> or the yard</i>
<i> that no one ever goes?</i>

34:16.871 --> 34:18.371
Someplace that's so creepy

34:18.390 --> 34:19.964
you hate having to go there?

34:20.117 --> 34:21.633
Uh, under the house.

34:21.802 --> 34:24.377
My mom used to store Christmas
decorations under there.

34:24.396 --> 34:26.563
Sounds exactly
like the last place

34:26.714 --> 34:29.232
your brother would expect you
to look for him.

34:32.629 --> 34:34.738
Are you serious, Jeremy?!

34:34.889 --> 34:36.131
Dang it!

34:36.149 --> 34:37.649
You found me.

34:37.801 --> 34:39.725
MOTHER:
I'm home!

34:39.745 --> 34:41.411
<i> I got to go. Thanks, Maddie.</i>

34:41.638 --> 34:43.080
Yeah, you're welcome.

34:55.502 --> 34:57.094
(chuckles)

34:57.321 --> 34:59.221
Hi.

35:00.006 --> 35:01.932
I'm not leaving.

35:02.083 --> 35:04.584
The apartment or...?

35:04.678 --> 35:06.678
This family.

35:06.772 --> 35:10.107
That's what you called us,
and that's what I want.

35:10.258 --> 35:12.484
The three of us together.

35:14.095 --> 35:15.670
That's...

35:15.763 --> 35:17.447
that's what I want, too.

35:17.599 --> 35:19.449
When I woke up the other
morning and you were gone,

35:19.601 --> 35:22.694
I felt... sad.

35:22.846 --> 35:24.770
-Yeah.
-Probably the way

35:24.865 --> 35:27.349
you felt every day those
six months that I was gone.

35:27.367 --> 35:30.368
Look, I don't expect you
to keep apologizing for that.

35:30.520 --> 35:31.277
I'm not.

35:31.296 --> 35:34.172
We're past apologies.

35:42.199 --> 35:44.599
This is a promise.

35:47.053 --> 35:49.187
I'm not going anywhere.

35:51.208 --> 35:53.692
I'm done running.

35:56.989 --> 35:59.381
Me, too.

35:59.474 --> 36:01.616
(chuckles)

36:12.896 --> 36:15.172
(indistinct radio transmission)

36:16.508 --> 36:19.092
(grunting)

36:20.828 --> 36:24.422
What you doing in my ambulance?

36:25.184 --> 36:28.076
Uh,<i> our</i> ambulance, and...

36:28.094 --> 36:31.021
I got to say, Wilson,
it's kind of a mess in there.

36:31.248 --> 36:32.838
No labels on the drawers.

36:32.858 --> 36:34.949
Tough for an outsider to find

36:34.951 --> 36:36.935
-their way around.
-Sort of the point.

36:37.029 --> 36:39.754
If I'm elected interim captain,
I would have

36:39.773 --> 36:42.032
you doing some serious
maintenance right now.

36:42.201 --> 36:44.359
A whole organizational overhaul.

36:45.612 --> 36:48.613
This is not a class president
election, Buckley.

36:48.765 --> 36:50.690
And you don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

36:50.784 --> 36:52.767
What I'm talking about is,

36:52.860 --> 36:55.270
your fluid levels are also low.

36:55.288 --> 36:57.047
Oh, really, which ones?

36:57.198 --> 36:58.456
'Cause I just

36:58.550 --> 37:01.051
topped off the oil,
transmission,

37:01.202 --> 37:03.419
brake and coolant.

37:03.646 --> 37:05.797
Per my report,

37:05.949 --> 37:07.966
your windshield wiper reservoir

37:08.060 --> 37:10.101
is down to three-quarters full.

37:11.230 --> 37:13.063
Uh, you can't just take that.

37:13.290 --> 37:15.047
It's department property.

37:15.067 --> 37:17.150
And a weapon in the wrong hands.

37:21.298 --> 37:23.406
Cap, you need to officially

37:23.558 --> 37:26.576
announce your replacement
because I can't take any more

37:26.728 --> 37:29.395
of Buck trying to prove himself.

37:29.414 --> 37:31.806
Oh, that's what he's been doing.

37:31.825 --> 37:34.084
I'll have a talk with him.

37:34.311 --> 37:36.311
So, who is it gonna be?

37:36.313 --> 37:38.146
Our new interim captain.

37:38.164 --> 37:39.314
It's a tough call.

37:39.332 --> 37:42.408
And, honestly,
I wanted it to be you.

37:42.502 --> 37:45.320
(stammers)
Me?

37:45.322 --> 37:47.079
What?

37:47.157 --> 37:48.932
You're smart, dedicated,

37:49.159 --> 37:50.934
compassionate,
and you're decisive.

37:51.085 --> 37:52.585
You're a great leader.

37:52.604 --> 37:55.421
(stammers, chuckles)

37:55.590 --> 37:57.590
I mean...

37:57.684 --> 37:59.925
you know when I first entered

37:59.945 --> 38:01.686
this department,
Captain Gerrard didn't even

38:01.838 --> 38:03.021
see me as a firefighter.

38:03.115 --> 38:06.190
And now, 12 years later,
my boss is telling me

38:06.343 --> 38:10.028
that I have everything it takes
to make a great captain.

38:10.180 --> 38:12.247
And you do.

38:13.274 --> 38:15.183
But you didn't pick me.

38:15.201 --> 38:17.109
I know how much you have
going on outside of work.

38:17.162 --> 38:19.521
-And I didn't want
to overburden you.
-It's not

38:19.689 --> 38:21.464
that much of a burden,
Cap, I'm already here.

38:21.616 --> 38:24.359
Right, there's
all this paperwork...

38:24.377 --> 38:26.044
Already do
a lot of paperwork, Cap.

38:26.120 --> 38:28.196
This can add another hour

38:28.214 --> 38:30.031
or two to every shift.

38:30.124 --> 38:31.808
You'll be gone a week.
That's what?

38:31.959 --> 38:33.143
Three shifts?

38:33.294 --> 38:35.562
Okay, so you'll do it?

38:36.815 --> 38:38.873
Yeah.

38:38.966 --> 38:41.225
I'll do it.

38:41.320 --> 38:44.112
(indistinct radio transmission)

38:46.049 --> 38:47.899
-Hey.
-Oh, uh, h-hey, Cap.

38:48.051 --> 38:50.493
I'm so sorry this is
still such a mess.

38:50.645 --> 38:52.236
I'll have it polished
and reorganized within the hour.

38:52.331 --> 38:53.479
I think it all looks great.

38:53.573 --> 38:54.664
I see you've been going
the extra mile

38:54.891 --> 38:55.999
lately and I appreciate it.

38:56.150 --> 38:57.483
Oh, just trying
to show you what I got.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.394
I already know
what you got, Buck.

38:59.487 --> 39:01.487
But I'm not naming you
interim captain.

39:01.581 --> 39:04.674
Hen has agreed
to take on that role.

39:04.901 --> 39:06.659
Okay?

39:06.828 --> 39:08.753
Um, yeah, no, I mean...

39:08.905 --> 39:11.072
come on, it's Hen, she'll-she'll
make a great captain.

39:11.091 --> 39:12.423
And so will you.

39:12.592 --> 39:13.683
Someday.

39:13.910 --> 39:15.410
You're a great firefighter.

39:15.428 --> 39:18.504
When you're all in,
nobody goes harder than you.

39:18.565 --> 39:20.748
But being a good leader is
about more

39:20.767 --> 39:23.509
than just the work.
It's also about life experience.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.695
And I think you need some more
of that before you're ready.

39:26.940 --> 39:29.991
Is this 'cause I don't have
a couch?

39:31.686 --> 39:34.037
Why don't you have a couch?

39:35.707 --> 39:38.449
I-I don't know, um...

39:38.602 --> 39:41.953
I guess I-I've been having
trouble picking one out.

39:43.048 --> 39:46.466
I think I'm afraid
of making a mistake again.

39:48.703 --> 39:50.369
In AA there's this idea

39:50.463 --> 39:52.780
that you take
inventory of your life

39:52.799 --> 39:54.206
admit your shortcomings

39:54.226 --> 39:55.783
in hopes that one day

39:55.802 --> 39:57.894
you can look at the world
straight in the eye

39:58.121 --> 40:00.730
and be alone
at perfect peace and ease.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.382
Come on, you, uh,

40:03.476 --> 40:06.528
you don't think I'm at ease?
(chuckles)

40:07.388 --> 40:08.813
I think the important thing

40:08.907 --> 40:11.074
is that you answer
that question for yourself.

40:11.301 --> 40:13.993
But when you are, you'll know.

40:19.251 --> 40:21.418
And then you'll be ready.
