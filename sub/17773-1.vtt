14:41.520 --> 14:43.398
No, they didn't.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.517
I'm very sure they did.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.559

15:17.440 --> 15:19.477
It was my job to take care of the crew.

15:19.560 --> 15:21.836
I had the connections
to get everybody paid,

15:21.920 --> 15:25.596

inside info to make dreams come true.

15:51.640 --> 15:53.996
- What is it?
- It's $5,000.

15:54.080 --> 15:56.515
You can pay me back later.
You don't even have to thank me.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.916

- The gig?

16:01.360 --> 16:04.273

16:04.400 --> 16:05.834
Former friend, actually.

16:05.920 --> 16:09.630
Used to be a deputy DA
prosecuting drug cases.

16:09.720 --> 16:12.360
So he got sick of watching himself go poor

16:12.440 --> 16:15.956

so he switched sides,

16:16.040 --> 16:18.874

16:23.320 --> 16:25.596
He needs some money
the wife don't know about.

16:25.680 --> 16:29.435
So, get this, he's setting up
his former clients for rip-offs.

16:29.520 --> 16:31.796
You'd like him,
he's your kind of guy, Troy.

16:31.880 --> 16:33.155
Who is the client?

till he got so much money

16:40.360 --> 16:41.919
that now they just call him Guard.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.317
He likes to play the fool.

16:44.840 --> 16:48.516
He says to my friend, the Armenian,
he says, "Hey, Mr. Cracker."

16:48.680 --> 16:53.111
He talks like that, says, "Mr. Cracker,
if you're so smart and I'm so dumb,

16:53.600 --> 16:56.274
why I got $5,000,000
and you workin' for me?"

He likes to drive a Beamer seven.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.550
But not in the hood.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.074
So he's got four, five little junker cars.

17:18.160 --> 17:20.038
You know, switch 'em one place,
one or the other,

17:20.160 --> 17:21.719

- TROY: Oh, yeah.

17:21.839 --> 17:23.160
But, this is where you come in,

17:23.319 --> 17:26.597
he don't keep anything worth shit
up at the Rocky River house,

17:26.720 --> 17:29.280
so you gotta find
where he keeps his stash.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.113

- Which dude?
- DIESEL: Over there.

27:51.240 --> 27:55.719
I really like my scotch neat and this fuckin'
bozo insists that I take it on the rocks.

27:56.920 --> 27:57.956
Why is that?

27:58.120 --> 28:01.797
Because the management has determined that
when people drink drinks without ice,

28:02.040 --> 28:03.440
they become drunk too quickly.

28:05.040 --> 28:06.440
So I kind of laugh at this.

28:07.080 --> 28:10.152
And he poisons my drink
with his two fat fucking ice cubes.

28:11.480 --> 28:12.800

- No, what's that?
- TROY: It's in France.

29:25.720 --> 29:26.995
It's a beach town.

29:27.640 --> 29:29.996
I guess you could call it like...

Actually, my mom and dad took me
to Niagara Falls once.

29:44.280 --> 29:47.193
It's the most incredible thing
because when you're flying in,

29:47.560 --> 29:51.474
it's like this blue sky,
and then the water's so blue.

29:52.840 --> 29:54.194
Bluer than your eyes blue.

29:54.800 --> 29:58.237
And the two reflect each other and
bounce off the white of the plane.

29:59.400 --> 30:00.595
I wanna go back there.

30:00.760 --> 30:03.832
I'll be, uh, makin' some money
in the next couple of months.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.434
Did you wanna go there with me?

30:06.000 --> 30:07.480
Mm, maybe.

You got that classic movie star look

30:21.600 --> 30:22.716

30:22.880 --> 30:25.270
I could be your Bogart,
you can be my Dietrich.

30:25.360 --> 30:29.112
You like those classic movie stars from
the '30s, like Cagney, Bogart, Edward G?

- I like those guys.
- WOMAN: Uh-huh, me, too.

30:31.720 --> 30:35.157
Okay, so if you want me to go downtown,

30:35.320 --> 30:37.630
it's an extra 300 bucks.

in going to Nice with me,

30:54.720 --> 30:57.280

for a little while?

30:57.680 --> 30:59.194

he's my roommate, and when he gets back,

You know what I fuckin' love?
Check it out.

37:23.680 --> 37:25.751
You cats not freakin' out about this?

37:26.360 --> 37:29.717
I been out longer than you guys
and I'm still freakin' out about it.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.349
- TROY: What? What is it?
- MAD DOG: Carpeting.

37:33.760 --> 37:39.157

if you had that privilege in your cell,

37:39.240 --> 37:43.156
and they didn't notice you wasn't wearing
your shower flip-flops in your downtime,

37:43.680 --> 37:48.675
all you felt was that cold concrete
with boogers and jizz on it.

37:49.600 --> 37:53.196
This is like... Dig it, man. Come on, man.

37:53.280 --> 37:56.000
This is sweet. This is like...

37:56.960 --> 38:00.112
Like... soft, shaved pussy.

38:01.200 --> 38:02.953
You have been locked up a long time.

38:03.160 --> 38:04.196
You know what I mean.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.117
Nah, I'll get us a real good gig.

38:07.280 --> 38:10.796
I'll get us such a good gig,
take your tits off!

38:26.240 --> 38:27.276
(CRUNCHING)

39:01.080 --> 39:02.400
So lemme ask you something.

39:02.960 --> 39:05.839
Do you think I look like Humphrey Bogart?

39:06.000 --> 39:07.036
CHEPE: No.

39:07.320 --> 39:09.835
Well, you see, that's interesting,
because I'm a big film buff.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.719
Bogart was the best, the king.

39:12.160 --> 39:14.231
When I was in the joint,
there was a movie producer

39:14.320 --> 39:15.959
who was in there with me,
and I... I says to him,

39:16.080 --> 39:19.039
I says, "Do you think
I look like Humphrey Bogart?"

39:19.120 --> 39:23.956
And he says, "Well, yeah, ya do,
but a stretched-out version of him."

39:24.120 --> 39:25.554
(LAUGHING)

39:26.640 --> 39:29.235
That's a fantastic story.
So where are your boys?

39:29.600 --> 39:31.239
I don't bring 'em to stuff like this.

39:31.320 --> 39:32.310
- No?
- Nah,

39:32.400 --> 39:33.993
they just know what they need to know.

39:34.360 --> 39:35.350
Okay.

39:35.840 --> 39:37.160
Shall we order a bottle of wine?

39:37.240 --> 39:38.913
GRECCO: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That sounds good.

39:39.200 --> 39:41.635
TROY: So, Grecco tells me
you're a heavy guy.

39:42.960 --> 39:44.679
(LAUGHING)
I'm not referring to your weight.

39:44.760 --> 39:49.113
I mean that, apparently, you are
a gentleman of some power and influence.

39:49.480 --> 39:52.393
Yeah, well, I try my best.
It is a shitty economy out there,

39:52.480 --> 39:54.949
so we all gotta work overtime
all the time.

39:55.800 --> 39:56.836
I heard that.

39:58.040 --> 40:00.271
Right. What's good?

40:00.560 --> 40:01.755
- Oh, they have...
- TROY: Get the rare steak

40:01.880 --> 40:03.837
with the cottage fries,
that's the only thing.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.039
- You do the honors?
- GRECCO: Yeah.

40:07.240 --> 40:09.835
So this guy, Mike Brennan, this creep,

40:09.920 --> 40:13.314
this deadbeat that owes me a lot of money,
the way I see it, he is so fucked up,

40:13.400 --> 40:15.676
he ain't never gonna be able
to get it back on his own.

40:15.920 --> 40:19.357
So he needs some incentivizing
to go out, to get up.

40:19.560 --> 40:20.550
GRECCO: A real scumbag.

40:20.680 --> 40:23.593
Yeah, he's one of those
fuck-you-come-and-get-it guys.

40:23.760 --> 40:26.036
Probably all hopped up on blow,
the way he's actin'.

40:26.280 --> 40:29.398
So the bottom line is,
Chepe has been patient.

40:29.920 --> 40:32.389
Yes, I have. Time's up.

40:32.600 --> 40:33.954
I need to get four mil from him.

40:34.160 --> 40:35.833
- Okay.
- CHEPE: Good.

40:36.280 --> 40:37.999
He's got a one-year-old
out in the Heights.

40:38.120 --> 40:39.440
I need you to snatch him.

40:42.160 --> 40:45.278
TROY: Kidnapping.
I don't dig the sound of this.

40:45.480 --> 40:47.915
Plus, there hasn't been an unsolved
kidnapping-for-ransom

40:48.040 --> 40:49.952
in the United States in a long time.

40:50.120 --> 40:53.992
I mean, granted, this was different,
'cause ain't nobody gonna report this one.

40:55.200 --> 40:57.032
Okay, so how would this work?

40:57.920 --> 41:00.719
It'll work because
I guarantee you a half a million,

41:01.280 --> 41:03.795
plus half of whatever Brennan pays,
if he pays at all.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.913
I don't know, man, nabbin' a kid
is a dangerous business.

41:11.040 --> 41:13.077
- People don't look too kindly on it.
- All right, take it easy.

41:13.240 --> 41:15.232
I ain't into abusin' children, you dig?

41:15.480 --> 41:17.312
Kid's still a baby,
he ain't ever gonna know.

41:17.560 --> 41:19.870
If he was four or somethin',
I'd never be doin' that.

41:20.600 --> 41:21.750
He wouldn't do that.

41:21.920 --> 41:23.195
CHEPE: Ain't nobody gonna be home.

41:23.920 --> 41:26.435
Just the girlfriend,
the nanny, and the baby.

41:26.520 --> 41:28.079
GRECCO: It'll go quick, Troy.

41:30.760 --> 41:36.233
Look, what if I give you 500,000
plus a $250,000 bump?

41:36.560 --> 41:39.439
Hey, man, you keep throwin' around
numbers like 500,000 here,

41:39.520 --> 41:42.718
250,000 there, pretty soon,
we'll be talkin' about real money.

41:42.800 --> 41:43.790
(LAUGHING)

41:43.880 --> 41:45.155
- Real money.
- Real money.

42:15.600 --> 42:17.592
Dog, Dog.

42:17.840 --> 42:20.071
Not to be rude, but can you
give the old man a break?

42:20.160 --> 42:21.150
It's important.

42:25.760 --> 42:26.830
MAD DOG: I'll be back.

42:27.720 --> 42:30.315
You can do a couple of those.
I'll be back.

42:32.480 --> 42:33.994
- DIESEL: Fall in love?
- MAD DOG: Sure enough.

42:34.160 --> 42:36.356
MAD DOG: She really gets me going,
I tell ya.

42:36.520 --> 42:39.957
She's somethin', but I can't really
figure out what she is.

42:40.160 --> 42:41.514
- I mean...
- DIESEL: She looks Puerto Rican.

42:41.680 --> 42:46.080
MAD DOG: Well, she doesn't taste Puerto Rican,
I'll tell ya, she's somethin' else, man.

42:46.240 --> 42:49.909
I don't know, she said somethin' like she's
an Indian, or somethin' like that, you know.

43:02.160 --> 43:04.231
All right, this is the game plan.

43:05.360 --> 43:09.798
The way I see it, we can keep doin'
this nickel and dime shit,

43:09.880 --> 43:13.951
maybe get away with a bit of it,
then eventually get caught or clipped.

43:14.520 --> 43:16.637
I don't see that your number
don't come up forever.

43:17.880 --> 43:24.195
Or Grecco has a big job for us,
as in $750,000.

43:24.320 --> 43:25.720
- Ooh.
- Shit!

43:26.200 --> 43:28.760
- It's a fucking baby-napping.
- That don't sound too good.

43:28.920 --> 43:30.639
It's not, and I'm not sayin' it is.

43:31.120 --> 43:33.157
But my feeling is,
where we stand right now,

43:33.240 --> 43:35.118
the small job thing isn't gonna cut it.

43:35.560 --> 43:38.678
I'm talking $500,000
with a $250,000 kicker,

43:38.800 --> 43:40.757
so that's $250,000 for each of us.

43:41.440 --> 43:42.715
Now we can do this,

43:42.880 --> 43:47.315
and my vote is that we should do this
because this is no kind of life.

43:47.640 --> 43:50.109
Fuck no, 100 percent not.

43:50.640 --> 43:55.431
I mean, if it came down to it,
I would literally eat a gun

43:55.520 --> 43:56.874
before the cops would pinch me again.

43:56.960 --> 43:59.555
I'm tellin' ya, I can't do it.

43:59.920 --> 44:01.991
- I got two strikes.
- TROY: Well, we all have two strikes

44:02.080 --> 44:04.470
so I think we are agreed
that that cannot happen.

44:04.560 --> 44:06.279
- DIESEL: Absolutely.
- I think we all understand

44:06.360 --> 44:08.317
that there's no way we're gonna get a foot

44:08.400 --> 44:10.312
in the straight world
without some serious dough

44:10.400 --> 44:11.880
with which to start businesses with,

44:12.000 --> 44:15.038
and we aren't gonna get that
by being some $10-an-hour monkey

44:15.120 --> 44:18.554
in a job we got from our probation
officer or an outreach program

44:18.640 --> 44:21.555
- or what have you.
- Aw, shit, you can't live off that shit.

44:22.840 --> 44:25.799
- So this seems to be the play.
- (KNOCKING)

44:26.200 --> 44:29.278
But I just wanna say this,
and I'm not tryin' to be melodramatic.

44:29.640 --> 44:30.835
I am looking out for you.

44:31.640 --> 44:34.235
I want us all to agree,
with this particular gig,

44:34.320 --> 44:35.674
there are only two options.

44:38.360 --> 44:41.837
Option one is total victory,
and that is what I am planning on.

44:42.600 --> 44:43.920
But, failing that...

44:45.160 --> 44:46.594
we are gonna go down.

44:47.640 --> 44:51.279
We are not going to get clipped,
and one guy gives up the other... No.

44:51.920 --> 44:53.274
It's gotta be samurai style.

44:53.720 --> 44:54.915

44:55.000 --> 44:57.839
No, what he's sayin' is, if we get in
a spot where we're gonna get pinched,

44:58.000 --> 44:59.229
we go down together.

Fuckin' thing that you always hear about.

45:10.240 --> 45:13.870
Where there's a gig, and there's a lot of
money at the end, you run away to Hawaii.

45:14.440 --> 45:17.512
That shit never, ever works out. Does it?

45:19.600 --> 45:21.000
I think it does sometimes.

45:21.600 --> 45:24.559
You just don't know about it
'cause they run off to Hawaii

45:24.680 --> 45:26.273

51:26.040 --> 51:27.030
Come on.

(GRUNTING)

51:41.000 --> 51:42.832

- Yeah, I got 'em.

51:43.520 --> 51:44.510
Yo, Troy.

51:49.160 --> 51:51.311
You guys take off, I'll wait for the mom.

51:51.720 --> 51:55.236
- There is no baby seat.
- Never mind about that, just get in.

51:57.280 --> 51:58.475
- You all right?
- NANNY: Yes.

51:59.200 --> 52:01.760
Baby seat. Just keep the baby
down real low.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.036
We should've thought about that.

52:03.200 --> 52:05.840
Yeah, I know. All right, guys, get goin'.
Call me when you get there.

52:39.960 --> 52:42.520
Carmen, I was gonna
get you the face cream...

52:43.440 --> 52:46.751
It's all right, your baby's fine.
He's perfectly safe.

52:47.120 --> 52:48.270
Carmen?

52:49.680 --> 52:52.320
We've got your kid, now calm down.
He's all right.

52:52.720 --> 52:54.200
- He's just a little baby.
- I know.

52:54.280 --> 52:55.509
- He didn't, doesn't...
- I know that.

52:55.600 --> 52:56.590
Now listen to me.

52:56.680 --> 52:57.909
- Hey, hey!
- WOMAN: Carmen!

52:58.240 --> 52:59.230
TROY: Hey!

53:01.040 --> 53:03.032
- You don't wanna go up there.
- WOMAN: Why?

53:03.320 --> 53:06.199
Because your husband had one of his
thugs watchin' you, and he got shot.

53:06.360 --> 53:07.760
There's a dead guy in our house?

53:07.840 --> 53:09.399
No, but there's some
very messy shit up there.

53:09.640 --> 53:11.154
- It's gonna be my ass...
- Shut up!

53:11.240 --> 53:14.472
Shut the fuck up, man!
What don't you understand?

53:14.680 --> 53:17.434
Now, do you know how to
get in touch with Mike, the father?

53:17.960 --> 53:19.838
I have a number for him in Canton.

53:19.920 --> 53:22.037
Okay, good.
Canton is good, that's a start.

53:22.120 --> 53:24.874
Now I need ya to call him,
tell him his kid's collateral

53:24.960 --> 53:26.679
on money he owes
an old friend from prison,

53:26.760 --> 53:28.956
and as soon as he pays it,
he gets the kid back, okay?

53:29.040 --> 53:30.030
Carmen!

53:32.320 --> 53:33.640
- TROY: Lady!
- (COCKING GUN)

53:34.080 --> 53:35.799

53:36.840 --> 53:38.035
(GUNSHOT)

54:19.760 --> 54:21.399
All right, did you get your phone charged?

54:21.560 --> 54:22.550
- CARMEN: Yes.
- TROY: Okay, good,

54:22.720 --> 54:24.473
'cause we're gonna call you
in a little bit, so keep it charged.

54:24.560 --> 54:26.517
If you need to, you can plug in
that charger over there.

54:26.640 --> 54:27.630
Now we're gonna call you.

54:27.800 --> 54:31.200
We're gonna give you the combination to
that lock, and then you can let yourself out.

54:31.520 --> 54:32.840
Do you understand what I'm saying?

54:32.920 --> 54:33.956
Yes.

54:34.400 --> 54:36.357
Here's a pen so you can
write down the combination.

54:37.360 --> 54:42.280
And if we don't call right away, don't panic,
don't do anything, don't call anybody,

54:42.440 --> 54:44.318
'cause we got people outside, ya see?

54:44.520 --> 54:48.789
And they're gonna get very upset if they see
anything weird or they hear anything weird.

54:48.920 --> 54:49.990
Do you understand what I'm saying?

54:50.080 --> 54:51.070
- Yep.
- Yes.

54:51.160 --> 54:52.480
Oh, you like that, huh? All right.

54:52.760 --> 54:54.353
This will all be over with very soon.

54:54.440 --> 54:55.794
Come here, gimme a big bear hug,
come here.

54:55.920 --> 54:58.037
- Come on, come on, there you go.
- (CRYING) No!

54:59.160 --> 55:01.675
All right, you'll be fine, baby.
All right, gentlemen, let's go.

55:16.240 --> 55:19.392
I gotta call Grecco, I gotta buy
a disposable phone and call him.

55:19.480 --> 55:22.034
- What?
- I know, that's how he wants me to do this.

55:22.160 --> 55:24.880
I'm tellin' ya, man,
all these people coverin' themselves.

55:24.960 --> 55:26.792
And they fuck up the most basic shit.

55:26.960 --> 55:29.236
Dog, you got a place
to put the body, right?

55:29.320 --> 55:32.119
Yeah, I got a good place
on the way towards Toledo.

55:32.560 --> 55:33.676
That's pretty fuckin' far, man.

55:33.840 --> 55:36.355
MAD DOG: No, no, it's like two hours,
two and a half tops.

55:36.440 --> 55:38.272
All right, I'll go call Grecco.

55:38.400 --> 55:41.120
Find out where and when
he wants us to pick up the dough.

55:47.440 --> 55:48.556
(ENGINE STARTS)

55:53.960 --> 55:55.235
(PHONE RINGS)

55:55.600 --> 55:57.080
- It's me.
- GRECCO: Yeah.

55:57.520 --> 56:00.870
All right, we've got the kid,
we've got the nanny, it's all good.

56:01.120 --> 56:04.997
Now the wife didn't show up,
so if you can get me a contact on Brennan,

56:05.120 --> 56:06.839
I'll arrange for the ransom myself.

56:07.480 --> 56:08.755
GRECCO: I don't think so.

56:09.640 --> 56:10.710
What do you mean?

56:10.840 --> 56:14.197
GRECCO: Did you guys happen to
encounter a problem at that house?

56:15.680 --> 56:17.797
- We did in fact, yes.
- GRECCO: Uh-huh.

56:17.880 --> 56:21.077
I thought maybe you did, 'cause that
Brennan guy hasn't shown up for anything.

56:21.360 --> 56:23.397
Nobody's heard from him, he's disappeared.

56:23.520 --> 56:24.715
No, we didn't deal with Brennan.

56:24.800 --> 56:27.440
There was a soldier in there,
some Mexican guy.

56:28.160 --> 56:31.073
- That was Brennan.
- I don't follow.

56:31.160 --> 56:35.598
He has, like, a Mexican mom, an Irish dad,
and he's a totally Latin-lookin' dude,

56:35.680 --> 56:37.558
so that was Brennan.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.514
You shot Brennan.

56:39.840 --> 56:42.594
No, because on his ID,
it said Joe Vasquez.

56:42.680 --> 56:44.672
Look, Grecco, I'm not...
I'm not sure about this, okay?

56:44.800 --> 56:45.995
Well, I'm sure about it.

56:46.080 --> 56:48.231
I'm 100 percent fucking sure about it.

56:48.360 --> 56:51.593
You shot the guy what was the guy that
was supposed to pay the ransom money.

56:54.800 --> 56:57.634
So... So what's what?
I mean, what are we gonna do here?

56:59.400 --> 57:00.629
GRECCO: I don't know.

57:00.880 --> 57:04.760
I mean, Chepe's not gonna be happy
about Brennan gettin' whacked.

57:05.120 --> 57:07.157
But, on the other hand,
you didn't try to cheat him

57:07.280 --> 57:09.795
so he'll get over it, I hope. I hope.

57:10.560 --> 57:13.155
I mean, he has to understand that
there's a certain likelihood that...

57:13.280 --> 57:17.479
He don't have to understand shit.
He doesn't understand shit.

57:17.760 --> 57:21.549
He's a stubborn fucking pig-headed beaner.

57:21.840 --> 57:26.119
But I will try to cool him off, Troy.

57:26.440 --> 57:28.033
All right, I mean, look,

57:28.280 --> 57:31.034
- we're almost outta gas here.
- What's that supposed to mean?

57:31.360 --> 57:32.589
It means we're out of money.

57:32.800 --> 57:35.360
We were counting on this to...
To work out.

last nickel right now, so...

- GRECCO: Yeah, exactly.

57:51.360 --> 57:54.910
I'll get ya some dough and we'll see
what we're gonna do about Chepe.

57:55.320 --> 57:58.074
I mean, he should cool off eventually...

57:58.280 --> 57:59.316
I hope.

57:59.480 --> 58:01.597
All right, I'll see ya tomorrow at ten.

how to take ya to that place

a logistical thing?

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:30.231
Is this really far out fuckin' place
that we're goin',

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.198
is this where you dumped
Sheila and the kid?

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.795
I wanted to put that Mexican dude here

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:38.510
so I could put a period
on that part of my life, man.

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:39.835
You know what I mean?

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:44.919
I wanna make a strong action
and fuckin' change some things

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.516
so I could be the person
that I know I could be.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.276
Okay.

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:55.395
- You'll help me do it, yeah?
- DIESEL: Yeah.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:59.351
You'll fuckin' help me untangle my life

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:02.319
and make myself a person
that doesn't make me

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:04.955
fuckin' wanna throw up
every time I pass a mirror?

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:09.154
Listen, Dog,
you are a fuckin' pain in the ass.

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:12.758
You don't know when to shut up.
You don't know when to listen.

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:16.877
And you have absolutely no idea
how to fuckin' control your emotions.

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:22.154
- That said, never lied.
- No.

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:24.676
- You never fucked me over.
- No.

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:28.317
In fact, I don't think you've ever
really fucked up on a job.

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:33.870
So if you reach out to me and you say
that you genuinely want my help,

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:37.592
that you're ready to glue
your fuckin' life back together,

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:41.953
there's absolutely no way
I can fuckin' say no to that.

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:51.680
Yeah, fuck yeah, deal.

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.000
Didn't work out.

Somethin' about me not keepin'
my foot locker locked.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.635
DIESEL: So you know this place?

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:36.794
MAD DOG: Yeah, it was shut down
since I was maybe 25.

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:40.237
Just go to the left.

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:41.880

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:18.272
So can I just ask you,

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:21.672
and I want you to be frank
'cause I really do respect you.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.357
I mean, do you think people can change?

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:29.716
I mean, like, if your behavior's one way,

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:33.637
that you can, like, alter it?

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.513
- DIESEL: You got a spot?
- MAD DOG: Yeah.

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:40.155
- DIESEL: Like a hole?
- MAD DOG: It's not a hole.

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:41.990
You'll see.

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:43.630
Set him down.

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:48.355
Where you put Sheila?

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:50.280
Yeah, and the kid.

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.150
Fuck me!

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:12.994
Let's just fuckin' dump him, man.

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:17.635
No, no, trust me, we gotta go
up there and place him in.

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:20.397
You said absolutely nobody
fucking comes here, man.

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:23.439
You're right, but in a billion
in a chance that one does,

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.200
we want that person to be invisible,

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:30.035

like, six or seven things.

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.477

they're gonna be rottin' anyway,

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.832

MAD DOG: Aw, shit, bro,
haven't you ever done sanitation?

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:48.431
It's a fuckin' fact in forensic science

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:52.714
that things begin to rot,
they're at their least toxic for you

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:57.431
because they are structurally bent
on their own self-destruction

01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:01.514
because, well, it's like an organism.

when you do a bunch of yakkin',

because he's a Hindu,

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:10.200
but he's got a lot of good ideas.

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.710

I wanna, you know, sit down,
and I want you to give me five things,

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:57.000

that I can do a reboot on.

Oh, you know, it doesn't
really make any difference

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:35.636
because I'm willin' to alter those things
because I believe in redemption, right?

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:37.240
