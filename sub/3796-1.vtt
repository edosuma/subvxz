E:
<i>Vince, you're gonna do</i>
<i>the stunt for what?</i>

00:03.512 --> 00:04.996
So these guys don't
think you're a pussy?

00:05.031 --> 00:07.082
No, I'm gonna do it
so I stop feeling like one.

00:07.133 --> 00:11.086
Vince:
It won't brake.
It won't brake!

00:11.120 --> 00:14.172
- I think I'm okay.
- Where's vince and what
the hell happened to his head?

00:14.206 --> 00:16.558
- I did it myself.
Do you like?
- Jesus.

00:16.592 --> 00:19.411
I've been hanging out
with a bunch of bores all day.
Nobody wants to have any fun.

00:19.445 --> 00:21.529
- What do you wanna do?
- I'm jumping out of a plane.

00:21.581 --> 00:24.266
- Both: What?!
- ( vince yells )

00:24.300 --> 00:26.701
Life is
passing you by, buddy.

00:26.736 --> 00:30.105
- I'm happy right where I am.
- I'd like you to sign a prenup.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.707
I want my own show, ari.

00:32.758 --> 00:34.442
I think we need to build
a show around you.

00:34.493 --> 00:36.928
- What the hell is that?
- "johnny's bananas."

00:36.946 --> 00:38.763
( laughs )

00:38.798 --> 00:40.682
Drama:
<i>How do I know that girl</i>
<i>vince is talking to?</i>

00:40.716 --> 00:44.236
- That's sasha grey.
- The porn star?!

00:44.270 --> 00:46.171
Who's come up with a name
for our football team?

00:46.205 --> 00:48.757
I think everyone's
a little sick of talking
about this, ari.

00:48.808 --> 00:50.708
<i>If you break</i>
<i>another promise</i>
<i>or lie to me,</i>

00:50.726 --> 00:53.295
I'll have to reevaluate
our relationship.

00:54.263 --> 00:55.664
I need a break, ari.

00:56.849 --> 00:58.950
- Carlos: To the future!
- ( people toast )

00:58.984 --> 01:00.752
I need a face
for my family's tequila.

01:00.786 --> 01:04.572
- So this is the business?
- Well, I wanted you
to taste it first,

01:04.607 --> 01:06.524
<i>So you can tell me</i>
<i>if you think there</i>
<i>is a business.</i>

01:07.743 --> 01:09.778
- ( turtle laughs )
- are you drunk again?

01:09.829 --> 01:12.964
No no no, it's not "drunk."
it's like a high.

01:12.999 --> 01:16.001
I close my eyes
for one minute
and he's dating porn stars

01:16.035 --> 01:17.302
<i>And starting</i>
<i>a tequila company?</i>

01:17.336 --> 01:18.853
Well, the studio wants you
to take a drug test.

01:18.904 --> 01:21.072
- You're on!
- We're gonna have
an intervention.

01:21.107 --> 01:23.141
- ( crowd gasps )
- e: How's vince?

01:23.159 --> 01:24.909
He's not gonna be
on camera anytime soon.

01:24.944 --> 01:26.611
I am officially

- I don't want to get

03:10.950 --> 03:13.985
I just want to know
when you're gonna get
your stuff out of here.

03:14.003 --> 03:16.104
Sloan, I'm sorry.
I've been a little crazy.

03:16.138 --> 03:17.705
E, I don't need
to discuss it.

Bye.

03:24.930 --> 03:27.399
- How did that go?
- Not well.

03:27.433 --> 03:30.468
Any word from vince?

03:30.502 --> 03:32.804
<i>( applause )</i>

03:32.838 --> 03:35.390
Hello, my name is vince
and I'm an addict.

03:35.441 --> 03:37.275
All:
Hi, vince.

03:37.309 --> 03:39.694
I've been sober
for 90 days.

03:42.314 --> 03:44.949
When I first agreed
to come here three months ago,

03:44.984 --> 03:47.318
I thought, "jesus,
how am I going to survive?

03:47.352 --> 03:50.538
No cell phones,
no emails, no friends."

03:50.573 --> 03:53.792
And then I realized this was
exactly what I needed--

03:53.826 --> 03:57.879
A chance to be with myself
and to reflect.

03:57.913 --> 04:01.199
Now I know I'm ready
to get on with my life.

04:01.217 --> 04:03.968
- Thank you.
- ( applause )

04:04.036 --> 04:06.171
- Good job.
- Nice job, man.

04:06.205 --> 04:07.538
That was hot.

04:07.556 --> 04:10.058
I totally bought you were
sober and going for it.

04:10.092 --> 04:12.877
- I am.
- Fuck, you're sexy.

04:12.895 --> 04:14.813
Sober is sexy.

04:14.847 --> 04:16.930
- Call me when you're out.
- For sure.

04:16.982 --> 04:19.017
Vince, don't forget
about me.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.435
I want in on that
movie idea you've got.

04:21.487 --> 04:23.655
Rehab relationships
are real, my man.

04:23.689 --> 04:25.723
I know it.
I'm gonna call my brother.

04:25.741 --> 04:27.659
Say hello to johnny for me.

04:27.726 --> 04:29.961
And congrats again
on your sobriety.

04:31.363 --> 04:33.564
You look amazing, man.

04:33.582 --> 04:36.284
That sounded kind of gay.

04:36.335 --> 04:38.336
Yeah, all is good, bro.

04:38.370 --> 04:41.172
Just getting the house
ready and looking forward
to having you home.

04:41.207 --> 04:42.590
Turtle!

04:42.625 --> 04:44.542
Sounds good.
I'll see you at 1:00.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.294
Yeah yeah,
we'll see you then.

04:46.328 --> 04:48.546
- Who's we?
- <i>Me, e and turtle.</i>

04:48.581 --> 04:50.181
Oh, e's coming?

04:50.249 --> 04:52.517
- Yeah, is that okay?
- <i>No, it's just--</i>

04:52.551 --> 04:55.253
It's fine.
I'll see you at 1:00.

04:55.271 --> 04:58.189
- Okay.
You sound good, bro.
- I am good, johnny.

04:58.224 --> 04:59.858
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Later.

04:59.892 --> 05:01.726
- Turtle!
- What?

05:01.760 --> 05:05.096
You want to explain
to me why I found this
in vince's bathroom?

05:05.114 --> 05:07.031
'cause it's advil.

05:07.066 --> 05:09.067
I told you to clear
this place of all drugs.

05:09.101 --> 05:11.035
- Advil?
- All means all--

05:11.070 --> 05:12.937
Aspirins,
cough suppressants.

05:12.955 --> 05:14.822
I don't even want
a throat lozenger
in this house.

05:14.874 --> 05:17.325
Me and ahnold have been
looking for weed and coke.

05:17.376 --> 05:20.044
- Did you find any?
- No.  Checked everywhere.

05:20.079 --> 05:21.996
The downstairs bathroom
behind the sink?

05:22.047 --> 05:23.748
- Almost everywhere.
- Jesus.

05:23.782 --> 05:26.918
- I'll take care of it.
- We can't take any chances,
turtle.

05:26.952 --> 05:29.554
I got rid of every
illicit substance I found.

05:29.588 --> 05:32.006
You emptied the bar?
That's gonna freak him out.

05:32.057 --> 05:35.260
I'm not that stupid.
I replaced everything with
non-alcoholic lookalikes.

05:35.294 --> 05:37.061
I got whissin
in the whiskey bottles,

05:37.096 --> 05:39.230
Non-alcoholic vodka
in the belvy bottles,

05:39.265 --> 05:42.767
And I personally hand-filled
30 various beers with o'doul's.

05:42.801 --> 05:45.136
- You're insane.
- I call it thoughtful.

05:45.154 --> 05:46.604
Jesus, we've got
to get going.

05:46.638 --> 05:49.691
- What are you doing?
- Getting rid of the weed.

05:50.743 --> 05:53.444
Oh!
( sputtering )

05:53.478 --> 05:55.430
Idiot.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.416
So why'd you guys
break up?

05:58.450 --> 06:00.868
What's the difference?
Why are we talking
about this?

06:00.903 --> 06:02.670
( laughs )
you brought it up.

06:02.705 --> 06:04.672
I just said my cousin
knows your fiancee.

06:04.757 --> 06:06.341
- He's very touchy.
- I'm not touchy.

06:06.375 --> 06:09.210
- She's just not my fiancee.
- But she was?

06:09.261 --> 06:11.095
Was, wasn't,
she will be again.

06:11.130 --> 06:13.848
They are like
sammi and ronnie on
"the jersey shore."

06:13.882 --> 06:16.017
Except sammi didn't ask
ronnie to sign a prenup.

06:16.051 --> 06:18.002
I asked my girl
to sign a prenup.

06:18.020 --> 06:20.138
That was it for us.

06:20.172 --> 06:22.273
Sloan's family
has a shitload of money.

06:22.308 --> 06:24.142
Can we move
past this, please?

06:24.176 --> 06:26.978
And her godfather used
to run this place until
eric tossed him out.

06:27.029 --> 06:28.930
<i>I don't give a shit.</i>

06:28.998 --> 06:31.349
The guy was a prick to me
after "rosanne" got canceled.

06:31.367 --> 06:33.368
That's because
he is a prick.
Fuck him.

06:33.402 --> 06:35.687
- But sloan is single?
- Scott: <i>Yes.</i>

06:35.721 --> 06:38.623
- That's interesting.
- Yeah, anyway...

06:38.657 --> 06:42.577
Anyway, you were
saying if I sign with you,
I'd get the two of you.

06:42.628 --> 06:45.830
- Exactly.
Yeah, we're a team.
- Perfect synergy, right?

06:45.864 --> 06:47.832
Okay, and if you get
sick of one of us,

06:47.866 --> 06:51.219
Most likely gonna be him,
then the other will bow out.

06:51.253 --> 06:53.755
I don't know.
I haven't had a manager
in a while.

06:53.806 --> 06:55.340
Okay,
and you're killing it.

06:55.374 --> 06:58.242
I mean,
you're on a hit tv show.
You're going to be a rich man.

06:58.277 --> 07:00.561
And that is why
your agents are complacent.

07:00.596 --> 07:03.731
But you cannot afford to be.
Okay, we will get you movies.

07:03.766 --> 07:05.767
I have been complacent.

07:05.818 --> 07:07.986
But I am totally
focused now.

07:08.020 --> 07:10.221
( phone ringing )

07:10.239 --> 07:13.908
That's caroline reysha,
a new victoria's secret girl.

07:13.942 --> 07:16.894
I have to fuck this.
Give me a sec.

07:16.912 --> 07:19.414
Hey, baby,
perfect timing.

07:19.448 --> 07:21.065
Why do we want
this guy?

07:21.083 --> 07:24.252
Because I will get
him movies and we will
make a lot of money.

07:24.336 --> 07:26.504
- Oh, you will?
- No, you will, okay?

07:26.538 --> 07:28.572
And listen to me,
you can't not want
to sign everybody

07:28.590 --> 07:30.858
That wants to fuck sloan
because everybody wants
to fuck sloan.

07:30.893 --> 07:33.177
Whatever, all right?
Look, you take care of this.
I'm leaving.

07:33.212 --> 07:35.630
- Vince is getting out today.
- I know.  Stop.

07:35.681 --> 07:37.715
- How do you know?
- 'cause he called me.

07:37.749 --> 07:40.518
- Bullshit.
- Are you mad because
he didn't call you?

07:40.552 --> 07:43.054
- He hasn't called anybody
except drama yesterday.
- That's not really true.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.972
He called me.
I'm actually going
to pick him up.

07:45.024 --> 07:47.975
- No, you're not.
- Well, he thinks
I'm going to.

07:48.027 --> 07:49.944
This is childish.
Stop, please.

07:49.978 --> 07:53.781
Scott, listen, I am going
to pick up vince with drama
and turtle and that's it.

07:53.866 --> 07:55.483
Okay well, vince thinks
I'm coming too, okay?

07:55.534 --> 07:57.318
So I can follow behind you
like a fucking jerkoff

07:57.369 --> 07:59.437
Or I can get in the car
with you like a human
being, okay?

07:59.455 --> 08:01.489
Can we be partners?
Can we act like partners
for two seconds?

08:01.540 --> 08:03.374
Wait.
Go ahead.

08:03.409 --> 08:06.461
Ari's on the phone,
wants to know if you want to
drive together to get vince.

08:06.495 --> 08:08.246
How does ari know
vince is getting out?

08:08.280 --> 08:10.948
- Said vince called him.
- Really?

08:10.966 --> 08:12.417
He's obviously
out of the loop.

08:12.451 --> 08:14.335
Tell ari's funky ass
to come pick me up.

08:14.386 --> 08:15.837
I'll go with him.

08:18.006 --> 08:19.807
It's not
every Monday, daddy.

08:19.842 --> 08:23.428
Yes, it is.
And I'd love nothing more
than hanging out with you,

08:23.462 --> 08:25.480
But you've got to stop
skipping school, buddy.

08:25.514 --> 08:28.099
When you come home
I'll stop skipping school.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.801
- I thought this
was temporary.
- It is.

08:30.819 --> 08:32.904
- So when are
you coming home?
- I don't know.

08:32.938 --> 08:35.239
Listen, I just need
five minutes to make sure
everything's okay.

08:35.274 --> 08:37.140
Then I've got to get you
home so you can rest.

08:37.159 --> 08:38.609
But I just got here.

08:38.643 --> 08:40.278
Daddy's got to go
to malibu.

08:40.312 --> 08:41.979
To get vince?
I want to go.

08:41.996 --> 08:43.581
It's a grownup's
trip only.

08:43.615 --> 08:45.533
- 'cause he does drugs?
- No.

08:45.584 --> 08:48.152
What-- did mommy
tell you that?

08:48.170 --> 08:49.921
No, I saw it on tv.

08:49.955 --> 08:51.956
- Ari, are you busy?
- Isn't that clear?

08:51.990 --> 08:54.709
- Oh hey, jonah.
- Hi, lloyd.

08:54.760 --> 08:56.461
How'd you get so lucky
to take the day off?

08:56.495 --> 08:58.780
- I faked being sick.
- I should try that.

08:58.814 --> 09:01.716
- What do you need, lloyd?
- Oh, I guess I should wait.

09:01.767 --> 09:05.236
Unless you want to talk
about some of your x-rated
weekend adventures,

09:05.270 --> 09:07.305
My son can handle
any business talk.

09:07.339 --> 09:09.507
Okay well, steve levitan,

09:09.608 --> 09:11.859
Creator of "modern family,"
is looking to make a move.

09:11.894 --> 09:14.812
- Great, go get him.
- He wants a meeting
with you and I.

09:14.846 --> 09:17.198
I can't do it now, lloyd.
I'm with my son.

09:17.232 --> 09:20.184
- I don't have any time.
- Ari, you haven't
had any time

09:20.219 --> 09:23.621
- For anything since...
- Since what?

09:23.655 --> 09:27.041
Since the
s-e-p-a-r-a-t-I-o-n.

09:27.075 --> 09:29.527
- I can spell
"separation," you know.
- Get out.

09:29.545 --> 09:32.130
- Ari.
- I will take care of it
when I have some time.

09:32.164 --> 09:34.365
And don't ever spell
in front of my son again,

09:34.383 --> 09:36.834
Because he's s-m-a-r-t-e-r
than you.

09:36.868 --> 09:39.337
- Bye, jonah.
- Bye.

09:39.371 --> 09:40.871
You're mean
to lloyd, daddy.

09:40.889 --> 09:42.723
- Get up, buddy.
- Why?

09:42.758 --> 09:46.894
Because I've got
to pay for the house
that I'm not living in.

09:46.929 --> 09:48.980
( cheering )

09:49.014 --> 09:51.849
We're here outside
promises treatment center
in malibu, california,

09:51.883 --> 09:54.602
Where actor vincent chase
is being released today.

09:54.653 --> 09:58.656
If you'll recall, mr. Chase
was arrested in August for
cocaine possession.

09:58.690 --> 10:01.692
And now the question everyone
in hollywood is asking again,

10:01.726 --> 10:05.196
Can a young star actor
get his life back on track?

10:09.384 --> 10:12.170
I just don't understand
why he would call
everybody but me.

10:12.204 --> 10:15.506
Well, e, he knows
you've been busy with
the new company and all.

10:15.541 --> 10:18.226
Yeah, e.
He probably just
wanted to avoid

10:18.260 --> 10:21.796
All depressing
things like your breakup.
I wouldn't take it personally.

10:21.847 --> 10:24.532
Heard he didn't call you, e.
Are you sure you should be here?

10:24.566 --> 10:27.602
We don't want him
to mistake your pale round
face for a crack rock.

10:27.636 --> 10:29.353
- ( laughing )
- hilarious.

10:29.421 --> 10:32.023
- What the hell is that, scott?
- A tic tac.  What the fuck?

10:32.057 --> 10:35.142
Put it away.  I don't want
him seeing anything that
even resembles a pill.

10:35.194 --> 10:37.195
Don't go crazier
on us, drama,

10:37.229 --> 10:40.198
- Or we'll leave you
here for treatment.
- There he is.

10:40.232 --> 10:41.949
( cheering )

10:42.034 --> 10:43.985
Drama:
<i>Vince!</i>

10:47.656 --> 10:50.107
Let's get out of here.

10:50.158 --> 10:52.109
Who you gonna ride with?

10:52.127 --> 10:54.579
Three cars, guys?
Real eco-friendly.

10:54.613 --> 10:56.514
There seems to be some
communication mix-ups.

10:56.548 --> 10:58.499
Let's just hope leo doesn't
see this on "e.T." tonight.

10:58.534 --> 11:01.435
You're coming with me, bro.
You guys follow us.

11:01.470 --> 11:04.171
( cheering continues )

11:12.297 --> 11:14.765
Would you guys like
to see a wine list?

11:14.799 --> 11:17.602
No!
No, thank you.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.854
So what's up
with you guys, huh?

11:19.905 --> 11:22.189
Ari:
Nothing's up with these guys.
What are you talking about?

11:22.241 --> 11:24.609
They've been frozen like
ted williams waiting for
the return of their life.

11:24.643 --> 11:26.527
And now that it has returned,
let's get back to it.

11:26.578 --> 11:29.413
- Okay, what's up?
- Let's start with
"air-walker."

11:29.448 --> 11:31.883
- Am I out?
- Vince, it's not '07,
all right?

11:31.917 --> 11:33.868
- <i>They've been</i>
<i>waiting for you.</i>
- That's great.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.620
But you are gonna have
to submit to drug tests.

11:35.654 --> 11:37.288
And it's not the studio.
It's just an insurance thing.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.590
- It's not a problem.
- Great.

11:39.625 --> 11:41.792
- So when do I shoot?
- You start March in europe.

11:41.827 --> 11:44.929
- And in the meantime?
- In the meantime we are gonna
find something for you.

11:44.963 --> 11:46.997
- Actually, I have something.
- You do?

11:47.015 --> 11:49.350
I watched a lot of news
when I was in there.

11:49.384 --> 11:51.168
- Oh, it's depressing.
- Not always.

11:51.186 --> 11:53.888
Did you guys get caught up
in that whole mining disaster?

11:53.939 --> 11:57.275
15 guys stuck underground
for a month.

11:57.309 --> 11:58.976
Yeah, in chile.
That was like a year ago.

11:59.010 --> 12:01.312
This wasn't chile.
It was romania.

12:01.346 --> 12:03.281
These things happen
bi-monthly.

12:03.315 --> 12:04.699
I mean it was riveting.

12:04.733 --> 12:06.850
I mean I felt like
these guys--

12:06.868 --> 12:09.353
Cut off from all my friends
and family for three months.

12:09.371 --> 12:11.822
I mean I didn't talk
to anyone till yesterday.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.574
And you pretty much
spoke to everyone, huh?

12:13.625 --> 12:15.960
The main character
is an american,

12:15.994 --> 12:18.862
Mortgages his house
and smuggles his labrador

12:18.880 --> 12:21.299
Into romania to dig
for survivors.

12:21.333 --> 12:24.335
Anyway, I really think
there's a movie in this.

12:24.369 --> 12:27.722
- Yeah, could be.
- Yeah... Totally.

12:27.756 --> 12:29.223
A movie for you?

12:29.257 --> 12:32.093
I mean it could be great,
don't you think?

12:32.144 --> 12:36.163
Well, I mean there's not
a whole lot of time between
now and March, vince.

12:36.198 --> 12:38.899
And I want to direct it too.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

12:38.934 --> 12:41.319
- Johnny, order me
something good, huh?
- You got it, bro.

12:41.353 --> 12:44.722
- Track him.
- Yeah.  Vin, wait up.

12:44.740 --> 12:47.158
Directing?
A labrador?

12:47.192 --> 12:48.826
- Take it easy.
- I am easy.

12:48.860 --> 12:50.861
I just want to make sure that
we all have our senses here

12:50.895 --> 12:52.830
Because he's pitching
a lifetime movie

12:52.864 --> 12:55.416
That should be starring
the "marley and me" dog,
not him,

12:55.450 --> 12:58.068
And a bunch of dummies
are drooling like he's
selling "avatar."

12:58.086 --> 13:00.904
- No one drooled.
- I didn't hear you say
anything negative either, ari.

13:00.922 --> 13:03.124
I said it with my eyes,
all right?

13:03.158 --> 13:05.126
Listen, somebody's
got to talk to him.

13:05.177 --> 13:08.479
Nobody's talking to him today.
He needs time to acclimate.

13:08.513 --> 13:12.049
We don't have any time.
We've got to get him back
on track and fast.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.268
- I will talk to him.
- Give it a rest, scott.

13:14.302 --> 13:16.587
Give what a rest?

13:19.090 --> 13:20.608
This is not
the chilean miner movie.

13:20.642 --> 13:23.277
This is about aboveground
as much as it is below.

13:23.311 --> 13:25.229
- It's crazy touching.
- Sounds like it.

13:25.263 --> 13:27.481
And guess what the guy's
lab's name is, johnny?

13:27.532 --> 13:29.150
- What's that, vince?
- Johnny.

13:29.201 --> 13:31.135
- Amazing.
- Where are you going?

13:31.169 --> 13:33.154
- Getting something to drink.
- What are you getting?

13:33.205 --> 13:34.922
Depends on
what's in there.  Why?

13:34.990 --> 13:37.274
It's just that I made
some iced tea.

13:37.292 --> 13:38.609
- I'll take that.
- It's really good.

13:38.627 --> 13:41.712
- Turtle: <i>Grab me one too.</i>
- Okay.

13:41.747 --> 13:43.581
Stop telling him
the movie's good, drama.

13:43.615 --> 13:46.283
E, vince is in a fragile
state right now.

13:46.301 --> 13:50.087
He's feeling very intoxicated,
if you will, about this idea.

13:50.121 --> 13:52.623
- Even though it sucks.
- We crush him, he may need

13:52.641 --> 13:55.426
To get really intoxicated
and then he will not be okay.

13:55.460 --> 13:56.894
Okay, so we wait one week

13:56.928 --> 13:58.646
- And then we
tell him it sucks.
- Agreed.

13:58.680 --> 14:00.147
- Yes.
- We're not gonna tell him.

14:00.182 --> 14:01.899
I am.  And what's
a week gonna do?

14:01.933 --> 14:04.485
We waited a week
to tell you sloan sent
your engagement ring back.

14:04.519 --> 14:05.936
What?

14:05.970 --> 14:07.905
I've been carrying
this around,

14:07.939 --> 14:10.524
Waiting for the right
moment to tell you.

14:10.575 --> 14:13.661
- She sent it in an envelope?
- Not even a padded one.

14:13.695 --> 14:15.362
Imagine if we told you
that last week.

14:15.397 --> 14:17.748
I understand she wants
my shit out of her space,

14:17.783 --> 14:19.450
But this ring cost me
30-fucking-grand.

14:19.484 --> 14:21.118
Still hurts.
Still hurts.

14:21.152 --> 14:23.754
We wait two weeks
and then we tell him
it's a piece of sh--

14:23.789 --> 14:26.824
Couldn't carry five.
What's that?

14:26.842 --> 14:29.660
Sloan's engagement ring.
She sent it over
in an envelope.

14:29.678 --> 14:31.429
- Not even a padded one.
- That's harsh.

14:31.463 --> 14:34.715
Really puts what you've
been going through into
perspective, right, vin?

14:36.268 --> 14:38.168
I mean, you got it
way worse than vince.

14:38.186 --> 14:39.637
Yeah, I know.
I get that, turtle.

14:39.671 --> 14:42.840
- Did you take a place?
- No, I've been staying here.

14:42.858 --> 14:45.810
- Oh, I didn't know that.
- How would you?

14:45.844 --> 14:47.645
- E.
- I want to hear more
about the movie.

14:47.679 --> 14:49.313
How about those
iced teas, huh?

14:49.347 --> 14:52.116
Tell me about this lab.
What kind of lab is johnny?

14:52.150 --> 14:55.052
- Yellow.
- Love it.  Yellow.

14:55.087 --> 14:56.737
What do you guys say we call
dana gordon about this?

14:56.788 --> 14:59.657
Maybe make up for some
of the troubles I've caused
her over the years.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.542
Let's do business tomorrow.
Tonight let's have fun.

15:01.576 --> 15:04.528
- It's a good idea, scotty.
- What are you guys thinking?

15:04.546 --> 15:06.747
- Spare room?  Voyeur?
- No.

15:06.782 --> 15:08.883
- Clubs?
- No, not a club.

15:08.917 --> 15:11.752
- All right, what then?
- Drama: I could cook.

15:11.803 --> 15:15.389
Cook?
Guys, I've been in lockdown
for three months.

15:15.423 --> 15:17.258
I need some excitement.
Give me some.

15:17.309 --> 15:19.310
We could order from vito's.
The delivery girl is hot.

15:19.344 --> 15:22.212
- Great pizza.
- Guys, really?

15:22.230 --> 15:24.932
All right, bro.
You ruined it.

15:24.983 --> 15:28.185
- Ruined what?
- We were gonna give you
a welcome home party.

15:28.219 --> 15:30.404
- It was gonna
be a surprise.
- Really?

15:30.438 --> 15:32.406
Yeah, it's gonna be
off the hook.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.692
- Who's coming?
- Who isn't coming?

15:34.726 --> 15:37.578
Sweet.  All right.
I'd better rest up.

15:37.612 --> 15:39.947
- All right, bro, take a nap.
- See you in a bit.

15:39.998 --> 15:42.065
- What are you doing?
- He's like a teenager.

15:42.083 --> 15:44.335
It's better to have him
home under our roof

15:44.369 --> 15:46.871
Than out running amok.
Turtle, clear out the bar.

15:46.905 --> 15:49.707
- It's all fake shit.
- This is gonna be
a sober party.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.542
Even the fake shit's
got to go.

15:51.576 --> 15:54.261
- Who's actually coming?
- You know any sober people?

15:54.296 --> 15:56.514
- Of age?
- E?

15:56.548 --> 15:58.149
Only billy walsh.

15:58.183 --> 16:00.718
Billy walsh.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.720
Now you're talking.

16:02.754 --> 16:06.607
- Hello?  Hello?
- Ari, what are you
doing here?

16:06.641 --> 16:09.193
Can I take the kids
to dinner tonight?

16:09.227 --> 16:12.112
- They have plans.
- Can I take you
to dinner tonight?

16:12.147 --> 16:15.065
- I am cooking dinner.
- I'd like to talk to you.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.484
- Daddy!
- There he is.

16:17.536 --> 16:20.070
- You staying here tonight?
- Nope.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.705
I just stopped by
to say hello.

16:21.740 --> 16:23.057
I want to show you
something I made.

16:23.091 --> 16:24.575
Oh, okay.
Go get it, buddy.

16:24.609 --> 16:27.077
- Okay.
- All right.

16:27.111 --> 16:29.330
( sighs )
are you mad at me
about something?

16:29.381 --> 16:32.416
- No, I'm just saying--
- no, I'm not talking
about right now.

16:32.450 --> 16:34.785
Lately you've been acting
increasingly hostile towards me.

16:34.803 --> 16:37.171
- I think that's
all in your head.
- Do you?

16:37.222 --> 16:40.457
Well, I'm not happy
that you've been picking jonah
up from school every Monday.

16:40.475 --> 16:43.594
- He wasn't feeling well.
What was I supposed to do?
- Monday is my day.

16:43.628 --> 16:46.480
- They called me because
they couldn't find you.
- I was at a charity event.

16:46.514 --> 16:48.899
I think that our kids need you
more than the orphans do.

16:48.934 --> 16:51.518
They're not fucking orphans!
They are fucking african
children

16:51.570 --> 16:53.153
With no fucking legs
and no fucking water!

16:53.188 --> 16:55.239
How many fucking times
do I have to tell you this?

16:55.273 --> 16:59.026
You know what?
You cannot just walk in
here whenever you want to.

16:59.077 --> 17:00.978
- What are we doing here?
- What do you mean?

17:01.012 --> 17:03.647
I mean how long do you want
to keep going on like this?

17:03.665 --> 17:04.999
It is devastating them.

17:05.032 --> 17:07.001
You do not use
the children like that.

17:07.035 --> 17:09.920
Okay, it's devastating me.
Honey, listen.

17:09.954 --> 17:12.756
- I'm devastated.
- I'm sorry.

17:12.790 --> 17:14.458
Honey, I want to come home.

17:14.492 --> 17:17.160
We agreed to try this
and it has only been
two months.

17:17.178 --> 17:20.714
No, it has been 10 weeks
and I am not liking this
one bit.

17:20.765 --> 17:23.333
I made a therapy appointment
for us tomorrow, all right?

17:23.351 --> 17:26.353
I miss you.
I want to come home.

17:26.387 --> 17:28.222
- I'm not ready.
- Tell me what that means.

17:28.306 --> 17:30.975
It means that I'm still
discovering things

17:31.009 --> 17:32.943
About myself
that I didn't know.

17:32.978 --> 17:34.678
Okay, like what?

17:34.696 --> 17:36.680
Let's talk tomorrow
in therapy.

17:36.698 --> 17:38.348
I want to talk
about it right now.

17:38.366 --> 17:41.702
Tell me why you don't
want me to come home.

17:43.455 --> 17:46.040
- I...
- Yes, speak.

17:46.074 --> 17:47.574
What?

17:47.626 --> 17:49.627
I've been seeing someone.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.467
Well, say something.

17:56.501 --> 17:59.336
What is there to say?

18:10.148 --> 18:12.716
Don't you think the balloons
are kind of stupid, drama?

18:12.734 --> 18:15.069
A roomful of addicts
can get a little heavy.

18:15.103 --> 18:16.937
I'm trying to keep
the mood light.

18:16.988 --> 18:18.555
- Should we hire a clown?
- Funny.

18:18.573 --> 18:21.224
Maybe we should auction
off this ring to the most
sober person here.

18:21.242 --> 18:23.160
Yeah.

18:23.194 --> 18:25.062
- What?
- Have you been drinking?

18:25.080 --> 18:26.664
- What?
- E?

18:26.698 --> 18:28.899
- I do smell real beer.
- Don't smell me, turtle.

18:28.917 --> 18:30.617
Well, if I can't smoke,
you can't drink.

18:30.669 --> 18:32.903
- Where did you get beer?
- I found it in the garage.

18:32.921 --> 18:35.222
- Turtle must have missed it.
- Jesus, turtle.

18:35.256 --> 18:36.840
You said clean out
the house.

18:36.875 --> 18:39.076
Well, now I'm telling you
to clean out the garage.

18:39.094 --> 18:40.844
Vince has never even
been in the garage.

18:40.879 --> 18:43.097
You want to take a chance
that tonight's his first time?

18:43.131 --> 18:45.632
- Now go.
- I'm going.

18:45.684 --> 18:47.584
And you, e, don't melt
down on me tonight.

18:47.602 --> 18:49.252
I'm not gonna
melt down, drama.

18:49.270 --> 18:51.855
Hey.  All right,
I've got five girls coming.

18:51.890 --> 18:53.857
They all claim
they don't drink.
Good?

18:53.892 --> 18:55.642
I'll frisk them at the door
for anything heavier.

18:55.694 --> 18:57.294
That's a really
good idea, drama.

18:57.329 --> 18:58.829
I see nothing
but dudes, johnny.

18:58.863 --> 19:02.116
Nothing but dudes,
but very nice balloons.

19:02.150 --> 19:05.436
The girls are coming
and the balloons are festive,
so don't molest them.

19:05.470 --> 19:08.155
- <i>( doorbell rings )</i>
- fatburger truck.

19:08.206 --> 19:11.508
- Nice.
- Ooh ooh,
can we get a bouncy?

19:11.576 --> 19:13.777
- Ha, billy!
- Vinnie!

19:13.795 --> 19:16.279
Hey, I'm sorry I couldn't
come get you today.

19:16.297 --> 19:18.132
You called him too, huh?

19:18.166 --> 19:21.301
Anyone else with you?
Not that I'm not happy
to see you.

19:21.336 --> 19:24.204
Just some girls.

19:27.092 --> 19:28.642
Well played.

19:28.676 --> 19:30.460
- What's up, billy?
- Joy.

19:30.478 --> 19:32.262
- Hi, vince.
- Sophia.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.565
- <i>Maria, debra.</i>
- Hello.

19:34.599 --> 19:38.819
Natasha,
elizabeth, ryan,

19:38.853 --> 19:42.005
Beth, maeve, paola,

19:42.040 --> 19:46.827
Ingrid, samantha,
madonna,

19:46.861 --> 19:50.814
Maryanne,
julianne, julie,

19:50.832 --> 19:54.351
Kristen, kersten,
kirsten.

19:54.386 --> 19:56.670
<i>( music playing )</i>

19:56.704 --> 19:58.839
Yes!

20:02.961 --> 20:05.712
How did you get all these
girls to come here so quickly?

20:05.764 --> 20:08.348
I went around to a bunch
of n.A., a.A.,

20:08.383 --> 20:09.933
Whatever "a" meetings
I used to attend.

20:09.968 --> 20:11.885
Told them vince chase
was dry and lonely.

20:11.936 --> 20:13.336
You are a genius.

20:13.354 --> 20:15.672
I think one of the meetings
was a sexaholic meeting,

20:15.690 --> 20:17.391
- But I'm not sure.
- Interesting.

20:17.442 --> 20:20.227
That girl doesn't like
romanian miners as much
as chilean miners.

20:20.278 --> 20:22.112
- Do you think
it matters?
- No.

20:22.147 --> 20:23.814
- Miners?
- This movie idea I have.

20:23.848 --> 20:25.899
- I'd love to tell you about it.
- I'd love to hear about it.

20:25.950 --> 20:27.985
Can I show you an article?
Scott?

20:28.019 --> 20:29.703
No no, I've heard
all about it.

20:29.737 --> 20:32.656
You go.
I'm gonna scan the place
for sex addicts, okay?

20:34.876 --> 20:37.461
Hey, did you guys
come together?

20:37.495 --> 20:39.213
If not, do you want to?

20:39.247 --> 20:41.048
Huh?
( laughs )

20:41.082 --> 20:43.533
Hey, sloan.
It's me.

20:43.551 --> 20:45.869
I know you're mad I didn't
come pick up my stuff,

20:45.887 --> 20:47.221
But I got
the package you sent.

20:47.255 --> 20:49.173
I've got to be honest,
now I'm a little bit mad.

20:49.207 --> 20:50.891
I mean I hope you
at least insured it.

20:50.925 --> 20:52.342
Woman's voice:
<i>To rerecord your message</i>
<i>press four.</i>

20:52.376 --> 20:54.728
Fuck.

20:54.762 --> 20:58.182
Hey, got the ring.
Thanks a lot.

20:58.233 --> 20:59.850
<i>To rerecord your message</i>
<i>press four.</i>

20:59.884 --> 21:02.820
Fuck!  Hey.

21:02.854 --> 21:04.855
<i>If you're happy with</i>
<i>your recording, press pound.</i>

21:04.889 --> 21:07.658
- Fuck you!
- What are you doing?

21:07.692 --> 21:10.727
Jesus, nothing.
Scott, unbutton another
button on your shirt.

21:10.745 --> 21:13.914
- Were you just calling sloan?
- Can we take the night off
being partners, please?

21:13.948 --> 21:15.415
Fuck her, okay?
Fuck her.

21:15.450 --> 21:17.501
Fuck her, fuck her, fuck her,
fuck her, fuck her.

21:17.535 --> 21:19.019
- I don't want you to do this.
- I'll fuck her.

21:19.053 --> 21:20.954
I'll fuck her and I'll tell her
to go fuck herself for you.

21:21.005 --> 21:23.006
- I don't want you to do that.
- I will, is what I'm saying.

21:23.041 --> 21:25.092
That's very generous of you
and I appreciate that.

21:25.126 --> 21:27.678
Can you just focus on the fact
that your best friend is back?

21:27.712 --> 21:29.680
- <i>Can you do that?</i>
- My best friend who
hasn't called me?

21:29.714 --> 21:32.415
Druggies always blame
their best friends.
It's what they do.

21:32.433 --> 21:34.468
It's addiction 101.
You should know this.

21:34.519 --> 21:35.969
Whatever.
I need another beer.

21:36.020 --> 21:38.272
- You have beer?
- I hid two in the bushes.

21:38.306 --> 21:39.606
- Can I have one?
- Sure.

21:39.641 --> 21:41.225
- Thank you.
- Everything all right, ari?

21:41.259 --> 21:44.728
- I need a drink.
- Ew, this is a dry party.

21:46.614 --> 21:48.949
I got two beers
in the bushes.

21:50.952 --> 21:54.388
Yeah yeah, it's an interesting
take on a familiar story.

21:54.422 --> 21:56.073
Isn't it?

21:56.107 --> 21:58.742
Ari.  Hold on, guys.
I'll be right back.

22:00.295 --> 22:02.246
- Was that sarcastic?
- What?

22:02.280 --> 22:04.464
An interesting take
on a familiar story?

22:04.499 --> 22:06.166
The guy's pitching
an m.O.W.

22:06.217 --> 22:08.752
The guy just
got out of rehab.
He needs positivity.

22:08.786 --> 22:10.620
You should know that
better than anyone.

22:10.638 --> 22:12.806
Yeah, you're right.
You're right.

22:12.840 --> 22:14.925
- You seem out of it, ari.
- No, I'm okay.  I'm fine.

22:14.959 --> 22:17.477
- I just, you know,
I need a--
- what?

22:17.512 --> 22:19.346
A drink?

22:19.397 --> 22:21.231
It's okay if you want
to have a drink, ari.

22:21.266 --> 22:23.100
I think there's a bottle
of vodka in the freezer.

22:23.134 --> 22:25.969
Thank you.
Good man.

22:25.987 --> 22:30.908
Hey, vince.
The coal miners/labrador
thing is genius, bro.

22:30.942 --> 22:33.076
If you don't direct it,
I would love to.

22:34.329 --> 22:36.446
Did you hear that?
Billy loves my movie idea.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.648
- Great.
- How's he doing on
your show, johnny?

22:38.666 --> 22:40.650
"johnny bananas"
is a beast, bro.

22:40.668 --> 22:42.986
It's funny, it's got heart.
Billy's killing it.

22:43.004 --> 22:46.290
Andrew dice clay
is really really killing it.

22:46.324 --> 22:48.842
- You like dice better than me?
- Did I say that?

22:48.876 --> 22:51.962
- E?
- No, you guys are both
amazing gorillas, drama.

22:51.996 --> 22:53.797
Yeah, but not
equal gorillas though.

22:53.831 --> 22:55.665
I'm johnny.
Dice is second banana,
right?

22:55.683 --> 22:57.768
- I'm dying to see it.
- I got clips in the car.

22:57.802 --> 22:59.269
- Would you mind getting them?
- Absolutely not.

22:59.304 --> 23:01.305
- I'll be right back.
- I could use a drink.

23:01.339 --> 23:03.690
The bar's full
of waters, bro.

23:03.725 --> 23:07.394
How great is this?
All the boys back together
living under one roof.

23:07.445 --> 23:09.646
- Just like old times.
- You're staying here too?

23:09.680 --> 23:11.481
Yeah, just till you
get settled.

23:11.515 --> 23:14.484
- I'm settled.
- It's gonna be fun
either way.

23:14.518 --> 23:16.353
Doesn't seem like
e's having fun.

23:16.371 --> 23:19.573
Well, the guy was supposed
to be married in three weeks.
He's a little sad.

23:19.624 --> 23:21.158
Is that what's
troubling you, e?

23:21.192 --> 23:22.743
Nothing's troubling him.

23:22.794 --> 23:24.494
Smile, e.
Come on, big smile.

23:24.529 --> 23:25.996
Why are you pissed
at me and nobody else?

23:26.030 --> 23:28.131
- E.
- Let's talk.

23:28.166 --> 23:30.334
- Let's.
- Tonight is not the night.

23:30.368 --> 23:32.502
It's fine, johnny.
Let's go.

23:32.536 --> 23:34.537
Vince doesn't need
any drama tonight, e.

23:34.555 --> 23:36.223
Vince:
<i>We'll be back.</i>

23:39.010 --> 23:41.144
Turtle!

23:41.179 --> 23:43.146
Drama.

23:43.181 --> 23:45.265
Hey, where's the vodka?
There's none left
in the freezer.

23:45.316 --> 23:47.684
I put it all away.
The place is crawling
with addicts.

23:47.718 --> 23:49.719
- Look, I need a drink.
- You don't want what I have.

23:49.737 --> 23:51.588
Just give it to me!

23:51.623 --> 23:53.573
There's eight bottles
in the barbecue.

23:53.608 --> 23:56.393
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.

23:58.079 --> 24:00.614
Turtle!

24:00.665 --> 24:02.532
So your girlfriend's the girl
in all those tequila ads?

24:02.566 --> 24:04.951
- Yes, I am
an overachiever.
- Wow.

24:05.003 --> 24:07.037
You know, the only thing
that helped me stop drinking

24:07.071 --> 24:10.573
Was to be able to focus
on her gorgeous face and not
the bottle in all those ads.

24:10.591 --> 24:12.709
Really?
Well, tell all your
non-alchy friends

24:12.743 --> 24:15.045
To keep drinking the stuff.
I own a piece of the company.

24:15.096 --> 24:16.847
- I will.
- All right.

24:16.881 --> 24:18.932
So is she here?
Where is that gorgeous
girl anyway?

24:18.966 --> 24:21.051
Oh, she's off on the avion
publicity tour.

24:21.085 --> 24:22.686
Oh, that's too bad

24:22.720 --> 24:24.888
'cause I would have
totally had a threesome
with you guys.

24:24.939 --> 24:26.923
- Turtle!  Turtle!
- What?  What?  What?

24:26.941 --> 24:28.608
E is stressing out vince.

24:28.643 --> 24:31.478
I need you to make sure
they don't get any
real alone time.

24:31.529 --> 24:33.647
- Why can't you do it?
- <i>I tried.</i>

24:33.698 --> 24:36.366
Plus scott's screening some
"johnny bananas" footage.

24:36.401 --> 24:38.902
- I can't miss that.
- Oh, you can't miss that.

24:38.936 --> 24:41.771
She's back in two weeks.

24:41.789 --> 24:43.707
Isn't honesty
one of your 12 steps?

24:43.741 --> 24:46.910
- Yeah, it is.
- So why's all your anger
directed at me?

24:46.944 --> 24:49.713
There's no anger.
That's one of my steps also.

24:49.747 --> 24:52.299
I'm not angry,
I'm disappointed.

24:52.333 --> 24:54.501
Vince, our business
and our friendship
are gonna mix.

24:54.552 --> 24:56.920
- There's no way around that.
- Friendship comes first.

24:56.954 --> 24:59.789
I hear you.
I'm gonna do my best
to separate them.

24:59.807 --> 25:02.059
Thank you.
E, I need a big year.

25:02.093 --> 25:05.729
I want to get back
and I think this movie idea
I got could be it.

25:05.763 --> 25:07.764
What?

25:07.798 --> 25:10.517
See, our business
and our friendship
are mixing right now.

25:10.568 --> 25:12.469
- How?
- Because I hate
the idea for business.

25:12.487 --> 25:15.105
But as your friend
I don't want to tell you
that because...

25:15.139 --> 25:16.973
Because why?

25:16.991 --> 25:19.659
I don't want you freaking out
and going off on some bender.

25:19.694 --> 25:22.612
- You're not seriously
worried about that?
- Shouldn't I be?

25:22.646 --> 25:25.499
E, I went to rehab
to avoid jail.

25:25.533 --> 25:28.218
It actually was good.
I learned some good things.

25:28.252 --> 25:30.653
And I enjoy having clarity.
But forget that.

25:30.671 --> 25:32.289
You don't like my movie idea.

25:32.323 --> 25:34.007
- No, I hate it.
- Well, you're wrong.

25:34.041 --> 25:36.659
- Everyone else loves it.
- Yo, fellas.

25:36.677 --> 25:39.129
- Let's go back inside.
- We're talking, turtle.

25:39.163 --> 25:41.098
- Drama doesn't want you to.
- I don't care.

25:41.132 --> 25:42.516
- Go back inside.
- <i>No, it's okay.</i>

25:42.550 --> 25:45.018
Turtle, what do you think
of my movie idea?

25:45.052 --> 25:47.554
- What?
- I mean you like it, right?

25:47.605 --> 25:51.391
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, of course.

25:51.476 --> 25:53.843
- Are you lying?
- No.

25:53.861 --> 25:57.447
If you get a good script
and a good director--

25:57.482 --> 26:00.150
Well, you're directing,
so if you direct it good

26:00.184 --> 26:03.403
And someone writes it good
and you get a really
charismatic dog,

26:03.454 --> 26:05.989
- The sky's the limit.
- Wow.

26:06.023 --> 26:08.024
Vince.

26:08.042 --> 26:10.026
I can't take
this pressure,
all right?

26:10.044 --> 26:12.462
I've got to smoke
and that's final.

26:13.498 --> 26:15.248
( sighs )

26:15.299 --> 26:17.584
Do me a favor, ronald.
Tell me if I'm clear.

26:17.635 --> 26:20.053
I can't see beyond
the truck.  Ruffy!

26:20.087 --> 26:22.422
Yeah yeah, no problem.
Yeah, you're all good.

26:22.473 --> 26:24.841
- <i>You're all good, go.</i>
- ( horn blares )

26:24.875 --> 26:27.594
Holy shit!
Why did you do
that, ronald?

26:27.645 --> 26:29.429
It was funny.
I mean, why do you think?

26:29.480 --> 26:31.515
It wasn't funny.

26:31.549 --> 26:34.017
Bro, you've got
to see this part.

26:34.051 --> 26:35.735
Whatever, johnny.

26:36.771 --> 26:39.606
What the fuck
did e do?

26:41.025 --> 26:42.993
I don't know.
He says he's enjoying
his clarity.

26:43.027 --> 26:45.445
- He's fine.
- No, once you're an addict,
you're always an addict.

26:45.496 --> 26:48.365
- Lame!
- Drama: <i>You might want</i>
<i>to slow down, ari.</i>

26:48.399 --> 26:51.501
Fuck you, drama.

26:51.536 --> 26:54.421
An addict, unlike most people,
once they start drinking,

26:54.455 --> 26:56.906
Smoking or doing whatever
it is they're addicted to--

26:56.924 --> 26:58.908
Jerking off for me.
For sure.

26:58.926 --> 27:01.761
--It's impossible
for them to stop.
The compulsion is too strong.

27:01.796 --> 27:04.214
I myself, I cannot
even have one sip of beer.

27:04.248 --> 27:05.465
Why?
What would happen?

27:05.516 --> 27:07.250
After about a week,

27:07.268 --> 27:09.419
I'd be holed up in
my grandmother's house

27:09.437 --> 27:11.521
With my penis tied off
looking for a vein.

27:11.556 --> 27:15.392
( ari laughing )

27:15.426 --> 27:18.311
Quick, come out!
Vince is having like
a heart attack or something.

27:24.652 --> 27:26.603
Drama:
<i>Turtle, come quick!</i>

27:27.872 --> 27:29.823
E:
<i>How could you</i>
<i>give him coke?</i>

27:29.874 --> 27:31.791
I don't know.  I snuck it in
and he saw it and begged.

27:31.826 --> 27:33.493
I'm so sorry.

27:33.544 --> 27:35.178
- What the fuck?
- Drama: <i>Vince!</i>

27:35.213 --> 27:37.163
We thought you were
having a heart attack.

27:37.215 --> 27:40.950
I'm not having a heart attack.
I'm not doing coke.

27:41.052 --> 27:43.503
I wanted everyone
to see this.

27:43.554 --> 27:44.971
( girls gasp )

27:45.006 --> 27:47.924
That's okay, everyone.
Remain calm.

27:47.958 --> 27:50.894
He's still a friend of bill's.
That beer is not real.

27:50.928 --> 27:53.563
I know it's not real, johnny.
I know all of this is not real,

27:53.598 --> 27:55.649
Including the vodka
ari thinks he's tripping on.

27:55.683 --> 27:59.069
None of this is real
and none of you are being real.

27:59.103 --> 28:00.520
Because I'm fine.

28:00.605 --> 28:03.273
I didn't do coke,
I'm not gonna do coke.

28:03.307 --> 28:05.609
Okay?  I want to get back
to where I was.

28:05.643 --> 28:07.327
I want all of this
behind me.

28:07.361 --> 28:10.947
But if you, my agent,
my representatives, my friends
or whatever the fuck you are,

28:10.981 --> 28:13.867
Keep treating me
fucking weird,
I can't do that.

28:13.918 --> 28:16.486
- We get it.
- Good.  So now,

28:16.504 --> 28:19.822
If everyone thinks
my movie idea sucks,
just tell me.

28:19.840 --> 28:21.541
- It's really bad.
- It's terrible.

28:21.576 --> 28:24.294
- Possibly the worst ever.
- It was actually disgusting.

28:24.328 --> 28:27.830
- You too, billy?
- I mean, you know,
if it was on a network

28:27.848 --> 28:30.050
And drama
was the american,
I'd love it.

28:30.101 --> 28:33.219
- I love that.
- So do I.

28:33.271 --> 28:35.805
Can we make
that happen, ari?

28:35.839 --> 28:38.642
I'm still trying to process
the fake vodka thing.

28:38.676 --> 28:40.277
Come on, let's make
that happen.

28:40.311 --> 28:42.445
See, guys?
I can adapt.

28:42.480 --> 28:46.066
- I'm all good.
We're all good.
- <i>( dog barking )</i>

28:46.117 --> 28:49.235
- Turtle,
what's up with ahnold?
- I don't know.

28:49.287 --> 28:51.905
Anybody smell smoke?

28:51.956 --> 28:54.874
<i>( siren wailing )</i>

28:54.909 --> 28:58.244
Turtle:
I could make the argument
that this is drama's fault.

28:58.296 --> 28:59.963
I wouldn't.

28:59.997 --> 29:03.583
I'm just saying it was
his idea for us to hide
all our vices.

29:03.634 --> 29:05.201
I'm sorry, vin.
I'm an idiot.

29:05.219 --> 29:07.837
It's okay.
I think it's a good omen.

29:07.871 --> 29:10.223
A clean start.

29:10.257 --> 29:12.309
I agree, but where
are we staying tonight?

29:12.343 --> 29:13.843
You're staying here too?

29:13.877 --> 29:17.180
- I didn't want to be left out.
- Yeah, me either.

29:19.233 --> 29:23.720
- Are you crying, ari?
- No, I've got smoke
in my eyes.
