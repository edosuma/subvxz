WEBVTT

00:02.900 --> 00:04.930
(sizzling)

00:07.440 --> 00:09.560
What's all this?
Well...

00:09.760 --> 00:12.330
I thought that we could have
a new family tradition:

00:12.530 --> 00:13.930
Pancake Sundays.

00:14.130 --> 00:15.090
I got all the fixings.

00:15.290 --> 00:16.330
You can pick what you want.

00:16.530 --> 00:17.800
We got chocolate
chips, blueberries.

00:18.000 --> 00:18.960
I wish I'd known, honey.

00:19.170 --> 00:20.870
I made an early tee time
with Wayne.

00:21.070 --> 00:24.900
What? Well, wouldn't you rather
spend the day with your family?

00:25.100 --> 00:26.970
Of course. (stammers)

00:27.170 --> 00:30.010
He's going through
a divorce, you know.

00:30.210 --> 00:31.710
He needs this.

00:31.910 --> 00:33.050
I guess, sure.

00:33.250 --> 00:35.350
How about this? I'll take
some bacon for the road.

00:35.550 --> 00:37.320
Why don't you bring some
for Wayne, too?

00:37.520 --> 00:38.980
Good idea.

00:39.190 --> 00:40.290
Can I take the plate?

00:40.490 --> 00:42.370
Go ahead.

00:43.170 --> 00:45.790
Hey, Missy, you awake?

00:45.990 --> 00:48.390
It's Pancake Sunday.

00:48.590 --> 00:49.860
What's that?

00:50.060 --> 00:51.930
Well, it's a fun new thing
I thought we could--

00:52.130 --> 00:53.330
Where are you going?

00:53.530 --> 00:55.730
I told you. Six Flags
with Jamie's family.

00:55.930 --> 00:59.340
Oh. Well, I could
make you pancakes first.

00:59.540 --> 01:01.410
Pancakes and roller coasters?

01:01.610 --> 01:02.940
Do you want me to barf?

01:03.140 --> 01:04.640
Well, no.

01:04.840 --> 01:06.610
What's all this
about pancakes?

01:06.810 --> 01:08.680
(car horn honks)
Oh, it's Pancake Sunday.

01:08.880 --> 01:09.870
I got to go.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.090
Since when is it
Pancake Sunday?

01:12.290 --> 01:13.690
Since today.

01:13.890 --> 01:15.820
No, it's not.
It's Kellogg's Bran Buds Sunday,

01:16.020 --> 01:17.620
like it's been
for the past three years.

01:17.820 --> 01:19.130
Well, I thought it would be fun.

01:19.330 --> 01:21.390
I'll-I'll make you
any kind of pancake you want.

01:21.590 --> 01:22.700
On Bran Buds Sunday?

01:22.900 --> 01:26.370
Fine. I'll put Bran Buds
in the pancakes.

01:26.570 --> 01:28.020
That could work.

01:30.250 --> 01:32.970
It doesn't work.

01:33.170 --> 01:36.110
* Nobody else
is stronger than I am *

01:36.310 --> 01:38.640
* Yesterday I moved a mountain *

01:38.840 --> 01:41.180
* I bet I could be your hero *

01:41.380 --> 01:44.280
* I am a mighty little man *

01:44.480 --> 01:48.500
* <i>I am a mighty little man.</i> *

01:58.810 --> 01:59.670
Excuse me.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.930
Do you have a recommendation?

02:02.130 --> 02:04.040
Well, you can never go wrong
with John Candy.

02:04.240 --> 02:06.270
But, and this is
just one man's opinion,

02:06.470 --> 02:08.140
Pauly Shore is a comedy god.

02:08.340 --> 02:09.210
Really?

02:09.410 --> 02:10.210
You may pee your pants.

02:10.410 --> 02:11.440
And if you do,

02:11.640 --> 02:12.410
there's a Laundromat
right next door.

02:12.610 --> 02:13.650
(laughs) Well,

02:13.850 --> 02:15.750
I will watch this
and let you know.

02:15.950 --> 02:16.880
Sounds good.

02:17.080 --> 02:18.730
(chuckles)

02:20.700 --> 02:21.820
Did you find everything okay?

02:22.020 --> 02:24.290
Oh, yeah. He's really helpful.

02:24.490 --> 02:25.810
Yes, he is.

02:27.910 --> 02:29.950
(chuckles)

02:30.910 --> 02:32.770
Okay, thank you. Come again.

02:32.970 --> 02:33.770
I will.

02:33.970 --> 02:34.970
Thank you.

02:35.170 --> 02:37.040
See ya.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.800
(door opens)
Wow.

02:39.000 --> 02:39.810
(door closes)

02:40.010 --> 02:40.840
Wow, what?

02:41.040 --> 02:42.740
She was totally hitting on you.

02:42.940 --> 02:44.180
All she did was rent a movie.

02:44.380 --> 02:46.650
And then she laughed
and she touched your arm.

02:46.850 --> 02:47.750
That's textbook flirting.

02:47.950 --> 02:50.050
I'm sorry, I-I wasn't trying to.

02:50.250 --> 02:52.620
Georgie, it's fine.
You can flirt with other girls.

02:52.820 --> 02:54.390
It doesn't feel like I should.

02:54.590 --> 02:56.390
Well, we're not a couple.

02:56.590 --> 02:59.760
I know, but we're having a baby
together. That ain't nothing.

02:59.960 --> 03:03.060
All I'm saying is,
you're not tied down.

03:03.260 --> 03:04.200
Don't I get a vote in that?

03:04.400 --> 03:05.630
Yeah, you get a vote.

03:05.830 --> 03:07.720
But we get two votes.
You're not tied down.

03:11.750 --> 03:14.710
Oh. I didn't realize
my mom had company.

03:14.910 --> 03:16.180
Yeah.

03:16.380 --> 03:18.910
Uh, do I have to pretend

03:19.110 --> 03:21.250
I didn't spend the night here,
or...?

03:21.450 --> 03:22.950
I don't know how this works.

03:23.150 --> 03:24.280
It's fine, uh...

03:24.480 --> 03:27.750
you could've said nothing,
but now I know.

03:27.950 --> 03:29.360
Yeah.

03:29.560 --> 03:30.720
What's with the pancakes?

03:30.920 --> 03:33.430
Oh, I made extra,
so I was just bringing 'em by.

03:33.630 --> 03:34.960
MEEMAW:
Who's at the door?

03:35.160 --> 03:36.530
It's Mary!

03:36.730 --> 03:38.430
She knows I slept with you.

03:38.630 --> 03:40.150
Come on in.

03:43.820 --> 03:45.770
I brought pancakes.
Why?

03:45.970 --> 03:48.440
Well, I made 'em for the
fam-- thank you--

03:48.640 --> 03:49.710
made 'em for the family,

03:49.910 --> 03:52.040
and everyone
was busy this morning,

03:52.240 --> 03:53.510
so here I am.

03:53.710 --> 03:55.250
So what are y'all up to today?

03:55.450 --> 03:58.420
I was trying to convince
your mom to go fishing with me.

03:58.620 --> 04:00.690
Oh, fishing, that could be fun.

04:00.890 --> 04:02.990
I ain't going fishing.

04:03.190 --> 04:04.320
I'd go to a flea market.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.590
Oh, I do love a flea market.

04:06.790 --> 04:09.060
I don't want to buy
some dead guy's pants.

04:09.260 --> 04:12.730
Oh, the outlet malls are still
having their holiday sales.

04:12.930 --> 04:15.670
I'd rather die and have you sell
my pants at the flea market.

04:15.870 --> 04:17.940
Well, I'm sure we can come up
with something else.

04:18.140 --> 04:18.970
Well, hang on.

04:19.170 --> 04:20.670
When did we become a threesome?

04:20.870 --> 04:22.980
You don't want to hang out
with me?

04:23.180 --> 04:26.180
Well, I do,
but he's not crazy about you.

04:26.380 --> 04:27.580
Well, that's not true.

04:27.780 --> 04:29.720
Well, then, it looks like
you got a fishing buddy.

04:29.920 --> 04:33.070
I don't really
want to go fishing.

04:34.970 --> 04:36.810
Boy, that was a close one.

04:43.180 --> 04:44.600
You okay?

04:44.800 --> 04:46.780
Mm-hmm.

04:47.850 --> 04:49.080
Are you mad at me?

04:50.620 --> 04:52.170
Why would I be mad at you?

04:52.370 --> 04:54.110
Is this about that girl?

04:54.310 --> 04:56.140
Why do you want me to date
someone else so bad?

04:56.340 --> 05:00.010
I didn't say I wanted you to.
I said it was okay.

05:00.210 --> 05:01.750
Well, it seems like
you want me to.

05:01.950 --> 05:04.180
I just want you
to live your life.

05:04.380 --> 05:06.120
Then why'd you sleep
with me again?

05:06.320 --> 05:07.490
It was one time.

05:07.690 --> 05:09.120
It was more than one time.

05:09.320 --> 05:13.190
It was one night,
and it was a mistake.

05:13.390 --> 05:14.590
Oh, really?

05:14.790 --> 05:15.990
Then maybe I should
go out with that girl.

05:16.190 --> 05:17.500
Maybe you should.

05:17.700 --> 05:19.260
Fine. And maybe you should
go out with someone, too.

05:19.470 --> 05:21.330
Right, because there's nothing
men want more

05:21.530 --> 05:23.870
than a girl with a baby
pushing against her bladder.

05:24.070 --> 05:25.900
You want me to pull
over at that Wendy's?

05:26.100 --> 05:28.990
Their restroom's
pretty nice.
Yes, I do.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.480
(door opens, closes)
GEORGE SR.: Hello.

05:32.680 --> 05:33.550
Hey, you're home.

05:33.750 --> 05:34.610
How was golf?

05:34.810 --> 05:37.000
Fun. Wayne hit a duck.

05:38.370 --> 05:40.150
Yeah, maybe you had to be there.

05:40.350 --> 05:41.420
Kids home?

05:41.620 --> 05:44.490
Nope. Just me. All by myself.

05:44.690 --> 05:45.960
Hey, sounds nice.

05:46.160 --> 05:47.140
I guess.

05:48.240 --> 05:49.400
Actually...

05:49.600 --> 05:51.630
(sighs) without church,

05:51.830 --> 05:53.900
Sundays are feeling
kind of empty.

05:54.100 --> 05:56.800
Aw. Hey, next Sunday
we'll do something.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.800
It's not just Sundays.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.380
I had Bible study, prayer group.

06:02.580 --> 06:03.910
I had a whole community.

06:04.110 --> 06:06.710
So, find a new one.
You just got to get involved.

06:06.910 --> 06:08.650
You know,
make some friends.

06:08.850 --> 06:10.250
You make it sound so easy.

06:10.450 --> 06:12.280
Oh, come on. Sheldon has
got school friends.

06:12.490 --> 06:13.800
How hard could it be?

06:18.540 --> 06:20.560
Hey.
Oh, hi.

06:20.760 --> 06:22.700
You were right. Hilarious.

06:22.900 --> 06:24.930
I wouldn't steer you wrong.

06:25.130 --> 06:27.320
You got any other
recommendations?

06:30.120 --> 06:32.810
Well, there-there is
a Mexican restaurant

06:33.010 --> 06:34.270
down the street
that's pretty good.

06:34.470 --> 06:36.480
I do like Mexican food.

06:36.680 --> 06:38.290
Hmm, we should go there
sometime.

06:39.290 --> 06:40.280
I'm free tomorrow.

06:40.480 --> 06:41.760
Cool. It's a date!

06:42.500 --> 06:44.750
Sorry. That was a little loud.
I'm just excited.

06:44.950 --> 06:46.870
For our date!

06:54.110 --> 06:55.290
Hi, honey.

06:55.490 --> 06:56.500
What are you doing here?

06:56.700 --> 06:58.560
Well, they needed volunteers

06:58.760 --> 07:00.330
for the book fair, so here I am.

07:00.530 --> 07:02.570
Hey, Missy.
Hi.

07:02.770 --> 07:05.240
Who is that? He's a cutie.

07:05.440 --> 07:06.690
All right, come with me.

07:08.190 --> 07:09.310
You need to leave.

07:09.510 --> 07:11.040
Why?
'Cause you're embarrassing me.

07:11.240 --> 07:14.750
(scoffs) Everyone knows
you have a mother.
Please.

07:14.950 --> 07:17.780
Fine, if you don't want
me here, I'll go.

07:17.980 --> 07:20.920
I promise I'll do anything
you want this weekend.

07:21.120 --> 07:22.250
Okay.

07:22.450 --> 07:25.060
Just not here
or near anyone I know.

07:25.260 --> 07:26.190
Can't wait.

07:26.390 --> 07:27.940
Love you, bye.

07:29.650 --> 07:30.730
GEORGE JR.:
<i>Hey.</i>

07:30.930 --> 07:32.470
You said if I ever
had a problem,

07:32.670 --> 07:34.070
I could come
to you, right?

07:34.270 --> 07:35.530
Yeah, of course.

07:35.730 --> 07:37.670
Not to mention,
you got all bent out of shape

07:37.870 --> 07:39.870
when I asked Dale for advice
instead of you.

07:40.070 --> 07:41.670
I didn't get all bent
out of shape.

07:41.870 --> 07:43.080
That ain't what Dale said.

07:43.280 --> 07:44.740
You want my advice or what?

07:44.940 --> 07:45.980
(sighs)

07:46.180 --> 07:47.580
So here's the deal.

07:47.780 --> 07:49.520
There was a cute girl flirting
with me at the video store,

07:49.720 --> 07:50.750
and Mandy saw us.

07:50.950 --> 07:51.720
Got it.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.240
And now Mandy's mad at you.

07:54.270 --> 07:55.690
Actually I'm kind of mad at her.

07:55.890 --> 07:56.860
Why?

07:57.060 --> 07:58.560
She told me I should
ask her out.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.490
The cute girl?

08:00.690 --> 08:02.130
I mean, I know
Mandy and I ain't together,

08:02.330 --> 08:04.030
but I thought
I was wearing her down.

08:04.230 --> 08:06.630
You do have
that effect on people.

08:06.830 --> 08:08.700
But now I'm supposed
to go to dinner with Amber,

08:08.900 --> 08:09.970
that's the new girl,

08:10.170 --> 08:12.170
and Mandy says
she's okay with it,

08:12.370 --> 08:14.140
but I'm worried it's a trap.

08:14.340 --> 08:15.510
Right.

08:15.710 --> 08:17.310
So what do I do?

08:17.510 --> 08:19.680
Well...

08:19.880 --> 08:22.250
(sighs) All right,
well, let's break it down.

08:22.450 --> 08:23.650
If you don't go
on the date,

08:23.850 --> 08:26.180
Mandy might be upset with you.

08:26.380 --> 08:28.790
Right.
But if you do go,

08:28.990 --> 08:30.660
you might feel guilty.

08:30.860 --> 08:32.320
Right, but if I don't go,

08:32.520 --> 08:34.530
the new girl's gonna
get stood up, and she'll be mad.

08:34.730 --> 08:36.390
Georgie,
you can't live your life

08:36.600 --> 08:38.060
afraid that women
are gonna get mad at you.

08:38.260 --> 08:40.270
It's just what
they're born to do.

08:40.470 --> 08:41.530
Makes sense.

08:41.730 --> 08:44.070
I'm not a woman.
I'm mad at you right now.

08:44.270 --> 08:46.660
(suspenseful music playing
on TV)

08:50.230 --> 08:52.140
You watching your
<i>Star Trek</i> show?

08:52.340 --> 08:53.310
I am.

08:53.510 --> 08:54.810
Mind if I join?

08:55.010 --> 08:57.550
Not at all. But I must warn you,
it's addictive.

08:57.750 --> 08:59.050
KIRA: ...taking you
into this wormhole.

08:59.250 --> 09:00.990
We have no idea what
we're dealing with in there.

09:01.190 --> 09:03.090
It could be hostile...
ODO: Major!

09:03.290 --> 09:04.690
I was found
in the Denorios Belt.

09:04.890 --> 09:06.420
Is that one Mr. Spock?

09:06.630 --> 09:08.030
No, there's no Mr. Spock.

09:08.230 --> 09:09.860
This is <i>Deep Space Nine,</i>
not <i>TOS.</i>

09:10.060 --> 09:12.260
Sorry, I thought
this was <i>Star Trek.</i>

09:12.460 --> 09:14.570
It is <i>Star Trek.</i> It's
<i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.</i>

09:14.770 --> 09:17.470
And this is the first episode,
so I'm trying to pay attention.

09:17.670 --> 09:19.070
Sorry.

09:19.270 --> 09:21.010
Well, the answers to a lot
of my questions may be somewhere

09:21.210 --> 09:22.310
on the other side
of that wormhole.

09:22.510 --> 09:25.480
(theme music plays on TV)

09:25.680 --> 09:27.150
Is that it? Is it over?

09:27.350 --> 09:30.780
Well, that's just part one.
There's a whole nother hour.

09:30.980 --> 09:32.270
Oh.

09:34.770 --> 09:36.150
So, is this your mom's car?

09:36.350 --> 09:37.810
Nah. It's mine.

09:38.970 --> 09:42.230
Well, it's very... practical.

09:42.430 --> 09:43.630
What car do you drive?

09:43.830 --> 09:45.400
Toyota.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.600
But my dream car is a Mustang.

09:47.800 --> 09:49.740
Oh, really? I used to have one.

09:49.940 --> 09:52.240
And you traded
it in for this?

09:52.440 --> 09:53.470
Why?

09:53.670 --> 09:55.060
Well-well...

09:56.220 --> 09:57.610
...I had my reasons.

09:57.810 --> 10:00.110
Oh, you wanted to look
like a soccer mom?

10:00.310 --> 10:01.650
No.

10:01.850 --> 10:04.150
It's-it's good
for hauling stuff.

10:04.350 --> 10:06.280
Ah, and they were all
sold out of trucks?

10:06.480 --> 10:07.420
No, I just needed...

10:07.620 --> 10:08.790
Something big
to carry your purse?

10:08.990 --> 10:10.360
Will you let me finish?

10:10.560 --> 10:12.880
(scoffs) Ooh, sorry.

10:14.940 --> 10:16.760
You know that girl
at the video store?

10:16.960 --> 10:19.400
The giant, pregnant one?

10:19.600 --> 10:20.950
Yeah.

10:22.020 --> 10:23.140
No.

10:23.340 --> 10:25.250
Yeah.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.140
So, you two are...

10:28.340 --> 10:30.210
No. We're having a baby,
but we're not together.

10:30.410 --> 10:32.780
In fact, she's the one who
told me I should ask you out.

10:32.980 --> 10:35.450
Well, that's not weird.
Really?

10:35.650 --> 10:36.900
No, it's weird.

10:38.830 --> 10:39.990
(door closes)

10:40.190 --> 10:41.350
Hey.
Hi.

10:41.550 --> 10:44.320
I thought Georgie said
you were going to dinner.

10:44.520 --> 10:46.190
No, uh, he's having dinner.

10:46.390 --> 10:47.530
Y'all fighting again?

10:47.730 --> 10:49.590
What'd he do?
Nothing.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.400
So why aren't you
at dinner with him?

10:51.600 --> 10:52.600
He's on a date.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.670
Why, that little...

10:54.870 --> 10:56.970
No, it's okay. I told him to.

10:57.170 --> 10:58.440
Why the hell would you do that?

10:58.640 --> 10:59.600
Why are you yelling at me?

10:59.810 --> 11:00.810
Because you got me all riled up,

11:01.010 --> 11:02.410
and I got to point it somewhere.

11:02.610 --> 11:04.010
Look... (sighs)

11:04.210 --> 11:06.080
I have enough going on here

11:06.280 --> 11:09.110
without worrying about being
in some relationship.

11:09.310 --> 11:12.650
Plus, Georgie deserves
to have a life.

11:12.850 --> 11:16.020
So y'all are good, and I don't
have to be mad at anybody?

11:16.220 --> 11:17.220
Right.

11:17.420 --> 11:18.760
Huh.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.940
I'm gonna go call Dale
and pick a fight.

11:27.550 --> 11:31.300
Oh, hey. I didn't know
you were working tonight.

11:31.500 --> 11:32.710
I'm not.

11:32.910 --> 11:34.310
Just meeting some friends.

11:34.510 --> 11:35.310
Oh, that's nice.

11:35.510 --> 11:36.810
Yep.
Oh, so,

11:37.010 --> 11:38.210
I was just getting
off work myself.

11:38.410 --> 11:39.710
Oh. Have a good one.

11:39.910 --> 11:42.930
Well, uh, so, friends
from high school, or...?

11:44.000 --> 11:46.050
More like a bunch of gals
that used to be married,

11:46.250 --> 11:47.520
used to be in Weight Watchers,

11:47.720 --> 11:48.850
and now just come here to drink

11:49.050 --> 11:50.660
and bitch about their lives.

11:50.860 --> 11:52.320
That sounds fun.

11:52.520 --> 11:54.160
Does it?

11:54.360 --> 11:57.200
Would you... (sighs)
want to join us?

11:57.400 --> 12:00.730
Oh, well... so long as
I'm not butting in.

12:00.930 --> 12:02.600
Well, I have to warn you,

12:02.800 --> 12:04.400
it's kind of a salty group.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.240
I don't want you to be shocked.

12:06.440 --> 12:07.610
You've met my mother.

12:07.810 --> 12:10.390
That's true. Come on.

12:11.390 --> 12:12.240
(sighs)

12:12.440 --> 12:13.310
Ladies?

12:13.510 --> 12:15.350
Mary here
is gonna be joining us.

12:15.550 --> 12:17.080
All right. Fresh meat.

12:17.280 --> 12:18.270
(women laughing)

12:22.810 --> 12:24.260
AMBER:
Since we're being so honest,

12:24.460 --> 12:25.560
I should tell you...

12:25.760 --> 12:27.660
I didn't really think
Pauly Shore was funny.

12:27.860 --> 12:28.490
What?

12:28.690 --> 12:30.330
Yeah. I just said it

12:30.530 --> 12:32.410
'cause I wanted
to talk to you again.

12:34.350 --> 12:36.270
So, I didn't scare you off?

12:36.470 --> 12:39.300
Look, it's strange,

12:39.500 --> 12:42.310
but I've got stuff, too.

12:42.510 --> 12:43.760
Like what?

12:44.960 --> 12:48.710
Well, I can't believe I'm saying
this on a first date,

12:48.910 --> 12:51.620
but I'm going through a divorce.

12:51.820 --> 12:52.850
Huh.

12:53.050 --> 12:55.150
I'm sorry.
How long were you married?

12:55.350 --> 12:56.290
A year.

12:56.490 --> 12:57.820
Ooh, a whole year.

12:58.020 --> 13:00.640
Sounds like you
really gave it a try.
(laughs)

13:04.450 --> 13:06.410
Do you still have
feelings for him?

13:07.320 --> 13:08.700
Do you still have
feelings for her?

13:08.900 --> 13:10.920
Mm, I asked you first.

13:12.720 --> 13:14.040
It's complicated.

13:14.240 --> 13:15.570
Boy, is it.

13:15.770 --> 13:17.780
I went to
two full-grown men for advice.

13:17.980 --> 13:19.460
Neither of 'em had a clue.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.750
So my friend said,

13:21.950 --> 13:23.350
"You have so much in common,

13:23.550 --> 13:24.480
you should meet him."

13:24.680 --> 13:26.850
I show up at the restaurant.

13:27.050 --> 13:28.950
(laughing):
He's my frigging cousin.

13:29.150 --> 13:29.960
JILL:
No.

13:30.160 --> 13:30.960
Did you?

13:31.160 --> 13:32.120
No!

13:32.320 --> 13:33.260
(laughing)

13:33.460 --> 13:34.860
All right, Mary, you're up.

13:35.060 --> 13:38.530
Oh, no.
I don't have any good stories.

13:38.730 --> 13:39.800
Oh, come on, you're married.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.070
You're the only one of us
getting any.

13:41.270 --> 13:42.200
Really?

13:42.400 --> 13:43.670
That's what we're talking about?

13:43.870 --> 13:44.870
Married people sex?

13:45.070 --> 13:47.570
Well, George and I have been...

13:47.770 --> 13:49.210
connecting more lately.

13:49.410 --> 13:51.210
JILL AND HELEN:
Ooh!

13:51.410 --> 13:52.210
Details. Now.

13:52.410 --> 13:53.410
No, no, no, I can't.

13:53.610 --> 13:54.980
Oh, come on.

13:55.180 --> 13:57.720
It's bad enough this one's
got her secret boyfriend

13:57.920 --> 13:58.950
she won't tell us about.

13:59.150 --> 14:00.350
Brenda Sparks.

14:00.550 --> 14:01.790
How do I not know this?

14:01.990 --> 14:05.060
First of all, I'm not
Brenda Sparks anymore.

14:05.260 --> 14:06.390
Oh, don't go changing
the subject.

14:06.590 --> 14:08.790
And... there's no one.

14:08.990 --> 14:11.230
She's lying. There's some guy

14:11.430 --> 14:12.330
that she was sweet on,

14:12.530 --> 14:13.600
but she won't
give us any info.

14:13.800 --> 14:14.670
(whispers):
I think he's married.

14:14.870 --> 14:16.100
Mm-hmm.
(gasps)

14:16.300 --> 14:17.370
He's not.

14:17.570 --> 14:18.840
Oh, interesting.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.270
I thought there was no one.

14:20.470 --> 14:22.980
JILL AND HELEN:
Ooh...!

14:23.180 --> 14:25.410
If you like friendly cats,
this next item...

14:25.610 --> 14:26.880
What are you watching?

14:27.080 --> 14:30.170
The crap-I-don't-
need channel.

14:34.370 --> 14:35.390
What are you looking at?

14:35.590 --> 14:37.560
Nothing.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.260
He come back yet?

14:39.460 --> 14:41.130
No.

14:41.330 --> 14:45.000
But you don't care
'cause you're good with this.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.970
I am.

14:47.170 --> 14:48.520
I think.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.000
Second thoughts?

14:51.200 --> 14:52.910
(sighs)

14:53.110 --> 14:54.540
I mean,
if it wasn't for the baby,

14:54.740 --> 14:56.140
I never would've seen him again.

14:56.340 --> 14:58.690
But there is a baby.

15:00.030 --> 15:01.280
Yeah.

15:01.480 --> 15:02.810
And he's been so great.

15:03.020 --> 15:05.150
And I keep pushing him away

15:05.350 --> 15:07.020
and pushing him away, and...

15:07.220 --> 15:10.710
he's still there
every time I need him.

15:11.770 --> 15:13.260
What the hell am I doing,
sending him off

15:13.460 --> 15:14.930
with another woman?

15:15.130 --> 15:15.760
Yeah.

15:15.960 --> 15:17.700
No, I'm asking you.

15:17.900 --> 15:21.280
Oh, um, all right.

15:24.320 --> 15:25.170
Well?!

15:25.370 --> 15:27.090
Give me a minute.

15:28.520 --> 15:29.440
GEORGE SR.:
Hey.

15:29.640 --> 15:30.880
You stayed out late.

15:31.080 --> 15:33.650
I did what you said and
I made some new friends.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.910
Well, good for you. Who?

15:36.110 --> 15:39.650
Brenda, Jill, and, ooh,
either Helen or Ellen,

15:39.850 --> 15:42.520
but I missed my window
to make sure. (laughs)

15:42.720 --> 15:44.120
Sounds fun.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.320
It was. Oh... (gasps)

15:46.520 --> 15:47.860
and get this, I got dirt.

15:48.060 --> 15:49.330
Ooh, what kind of dirt?

15:49.530 --> 15:51.900
Brenda has a secret man

15:52.100 --> 15:54.370
that she is hiding
from everybody.

15:54.570 --> 15:55.470
Really?

15:55.670 --> 15:57.240
And he might be married.

15:57.440 --> 15:58.850
(chuckling):
Really?

16:00.790 --> 16:01.640
Well, who do you think it is?

16:01.840 --> 16:03.040
Oh, I don't know,

16:03.240 --> 16:06.110
but me and the gals
are gonna find out.

16:06.310 --> 16:07.250
(chuckles)

16:07.450 --> 16:08.480
What the hell, Brenda?

16:08.680 --> 16:09.750
What the hell, what?

16:09.950 --> 16:10.920
Your friends all know

16:11.120 --> 16:12.480
about your "secret boyfriend"?

16:12.680 --> 16:13.950
You think that's you?

16:14.150 --> 16:15.550
Well...

16:15.750 --> 16:16.940
it's not?

16:17.710 --> 16:19.040
No, George.

16:20.380 --> 16:21.490
Well, who is it?

16:21.690 --> 16:22.930
I didn't tell them.

16:23.130 --> 16:24.130
I'm not gonna tell you.

16:24.330 --> 16:25.300
Okay.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.000
Oh, God.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.370
Are you upset that there might
be another guy in the picture?

16:29.570 --> 16:30.500
No.

16:30.700 --> 16:31.900
Good.

16:32.100 --> 16:33.410
Go home to your wife.

16:33.610 --> 16:34.970
I will.

16:35.170 --> 16:36.160
Okay.

16:37.790 --> 16:40.030
(chickens clucking)

16:41.530 --> 16:43.630
Shut up.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.800
SHELDON:
Mom.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.360
What is it, Sheldon?

16:50.560 --> 16:51.990
I know you had some questions
about <i>Star Trek,</i>

16:52.190 --> 16:53.790
so I've compiled
a detailed guide

16:53.990 --> 16:55.590
outlining all
the shows, characters,

16:55.790 --> 16:57.160
and how they fit in a timeline.

16:57.360 --> 16:58.730
Can we do this later?

16:58.930 --> 17:00.100
I've got a headache.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.070
Unfortunately not.
If we don't do it now,

17:02.270 --> 17:03.640
you'll be completely lost
when we watch

17:03.840 --> 17:05.470
<i>The Animated Series</i>
this afternoon.

17:05.670 --> 17:07.170
Just 20 more minutes.

17:07.370 --> 17:10.280
Mom, this is almost a hundred
pages. We have to get started.

17:10.480 --> 17:12.040
In the 23rd century,

17:12.240 --> 17:14.750
alien races from around
the galaxy have come together

17:14.950 --> 17:16.580
to form the
United Federation of Planets,

17:16.780 --> 17:17.880
which is-- open your eyes--

17:18.080 --> 17:20.170
headquartered
in San Francisco.

17:27.710 --> 17:28.960
Morning.

17:29.160 --> 17:30.200
Good morning.

17:30.400 --> 17:31.910
I think I owe you an apology.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.300
Yeah?

17:34.500 --> 17:36.130
You were totally right.

17:36.330 --> 17:38.390
I had a good time
with Amber last night.

17:39.190 --> 17:41.010
Oh. Good.

17:41.210 --> 17:42.310
I'm glad.
Yeah.

17:42.510 --> 17:43.610
We ended up talking for hours.

17:43.810 --> 17:45.240
