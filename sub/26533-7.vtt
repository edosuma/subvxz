00:01.784 --> 00:04.961
Previously onCharmed...You've got the Ibi in you.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.963
What is the Ibi?It means darkness.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.834
Oh, my God.
That's Mom.

00:08.878 --> 00:11.185
I think something's
wrong with the baby.

00:11.228 --> 00:12.577
It's natural
to be scared.

00:12.621 --> 00:15.493
MARISOL: I'm a witch
who sees the future.

00:15.537 --> 00:19.410
The pillar of your past
holds the key to your darkness.

00:19.454 --> 00:22.065
Maggie, I can't get you
out of my head.

00:22.109 --> 00:24.676
I told you,
that kiss was an accident.

00:24.720 --> 00:25.895
That black ooze,

00:25.938 --> 00:27.244
it's the primordial form
of the Harbinger.

00:27.288 --> 00:29.072
That whole apocalypse thing...

00:31.031 --> 00:33.555
Do you mind switching
paint cans with me?

00:35.992 --> 00:40.257
An exquisite choice. It pairs
well with a heavy red sauce,

00:40.301 --> 00:41.650
even a garlicky
bruschetta.

00:41.693 --> 00:42.868
Mmm.

00:42.912 --> 00:45.045
Enjoy the wine.
Thank you. Till next time.

00:58.319 --> 01:00.321
Hello?

01:07.371 --> 01:09.199
Somebody there?

01:24.432 --> 01:25.868
No... no.

01:25.911 --> 01:28.088
No. No.

01:43.712 --> 01:45.714
♪

01:51.023 --> 01:54.157
♪ Wake me up, ready for love

01:54.201 --> 01:55.854
♪ Can't hide how you're
craving me... ♪

01:55.898 --> 01:57.160
Parker, you
shouldn't be here.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.553
I couldn't stay away.

01:58.596 --> 02:01.033
Lucy has a new boyfriend,
so what's stopping us?

02:01.077 --> 02:02.470
Maggie Vera,

02:02.513 --> 02:04.341
can I take you out
on a proper date?

02:04.385 --> 02:06.822
That smile,

02:06.865 --> 02:08.476
gets me every time.

02:08.519 --> 02:10.391
Let me take you
to dinner.

02:10.434 --> 02:11.740
I have tickets to Beyoncé.

02:11.783 --> 02:14.525
VIP, backstage passes.

02:14.569 --> 02:17.049
And best of all,

02:17.093 --> 02:18.181
I have this kitten.

02:19.530 --> 02:21.880
Want to cuddle

02:21.924 --> 02:23.926
What?

02:23.969 --> 02:25.841
Macy wants to get to work
early today. Hurry up.

02:25.884 --> 02:27.059
Ugh.

02:27.103 --> 02:29.236
Are you using Harry's
training orb

02:29.279 --> 02:30.889
for Parker sex fantasies again?

02:30.933 --> 02:32.326
MAGGIE:
No.

02:32.369 --> 02:34.197
I was practicing a spell.

02:34.241 --> 02:36.373
Hmm, what spell?

02:36.417 --> 02:40.029
The... sexy...
kitten spell.

02:40.072 --> 02:42.771
Fine. I was fantasizing
about Parker again.

02:42.814 --> 02:45.077
At least it keeps me away
from him in real life.

02:45.121 --> 02:47.079
Good, because the last thing
you need

02:47.123 --> 02:49.081
is to get involved with
some philandering frat boy.

02:49.125 --> 02:51.562
I'm the one who kissed him.
And more importantly,

02:51.606 --> 02:53.695
are we ever gonna tell Macy
about seeing pregnant Mom

02:53.738 --> 02:55.697
when we went back in time
and what she said?

02:55.740 --> 02:57.046
No way.

02:57.089 --> 02:58.613
She's already really worried
about that psychic

02:58.656 --> 03:00.223
saying that she has
hidden darkness.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.312
I don't know, it just...
it feels weird

03:02.356 --> 03:04.401
to know something about
our sister and not tell her.

03:04.445 --> 03:06.229
Yeah, but what
do we really have to tell?

03:06.273 --> 03:08.275
All we know is that Mom dressed
like a hippie in the '80s

03:08.318 --> 03:09.754
and was worried
about Macy in the womb.

03:23.681 --> 03:27.294
HARRY:
Ladies, breakfast.

03:28.730 --> 03:31.515
A British bacon butty, anyone?

03:31.559 --> 03:33.300
That's a hard pass, Har.

03:33.343 --> 03:34.649
HARRY:
Oh, more for me then.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.433
Did any of you
happen to feel

03:36.477 --> 03:38.566
any seismic activity
last night?

03:38.609 --> 03:40.002
Seismic activity?

03:40.045 --> 03:42.613
Like an earthquake?
In Michigan?

03:42.657 --> 03:43.701
MAGGIE:
You know what?

03:43.745 --> 03:44.920
I did think I felt something

03:44.963 --> 03:46.182
when I got up to pee.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.270
I just figured it was

03:47.314 --> 03:48.750
the old house
settling or whatever.

03:48.793 --> 03:51.796
Common misconception,
"settling" always means ghosts.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.495
And if you felt something, too,
my fears are confirmed.

03:54.538 --> 03:55.931
It was a hellquake.

03:55.974 --> 03:57.498
A what

03:57.541 --> 04:00.283
A hellquake

04:00.327 --> 04:02.764
It's an earthquake,
only magical beings can detect.

04:02.807 --> 04:04.809
This one was very small,
which is a positive sign.

04:04.853 --> 04:06.811
Hey!

04:06.855 --> 04:08.726
I seem to have misplaced my orb.

04:08.770 --> 04:10.728
MEL: Harry, take that
thing away.

04:10.772 --> 04:12.513
She's gonna miss
class registration

04:12.556 --> 04:14.819
with all of her
orb sex fantasizing.: Orb sex fantasizing.

04:14.863 --> 04:16.473
Orb sex fantasizing?

04:16.517 --> 04:19.128
Not picking classes
has nothing to do with Parker.

04:19.171 --> 04:21.652
It's just, I'm a witch,

04:21.696 --> 04:23.219
I'm never gonna have
a normal life.

04:24.046 --> 04:26.091
Maybe I should just...

04:26.135 --> 04:28.180
I don't know, drop out?

04:28.224 --> 04:29.747
Maggie, college
is a really important time

04:29.791 --> 04:31.488
to figure out
what you love to do.

04:31.532 --> 04:34.796
What you l... Cute apron.

04:34.839 --> 04:37.277
Bartending is just temporary.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.930
Jobs in academia aren't exactly

04:38.974 --> 04:40.845
the easiest thing
to find right now.

04:40.889 --> 04:43.674
I hear you. I may be
joining you at The Haunt.

04:43.718 --> 04:45.763
Our new lab manager
starts today.

04:45.807 --> 04:48.810
I've heard she's difficult.
Gregorian's already been fired,

04:48.853 --> 04:51.682
which means the rest of us may
also be on the chopping block.

04:51.726 --> 04:54.076
I don't want to be late.
Are you ready?
Yeah.

04:55.556 --> 04:57.688
MAGGIE:
Later.

04:57.732 --> 05:00.125
Speaking of committing
to your academics,

05:00.169 --> 05:02.606
your thesis proposal
was due six weeks ago.

05:02.650 --> 05:06.218
In my defense,
I have saved the world

05:06.262 --> 05:09.613
four times since then.

05:09.657 --> 05:11.354
I will get it done.

05:11.398 --> 05:14.401
Julia Wagner.

05:14.444 --> 05:15.706
Hello, Dr. Wagner.

05:15.750 --> 05:18.361
Oh, please,
call me Julia. Sit.

05:18.405 --> 05:20.102
I see you studied
with Dr. Kobialka

05:20.145 --> 05:21.886
at Columbia. He and I
are old friends.

05:21.930 --> 05:23.888
Yes, he was my first mentor.

05:23.932 --> 05:25.281
I know how this looks--

05:25.325 --> 05:26.935
big company takes over the lab,

05:26.978 --> 05:28.763
in come the suits
and the yes-men,

05:28.806 --> 05:30.547
and there goes
any legitimate science.

05:30.591 --> 05:31.809
I want to assure you

05:31.853 --> 05:34.638
I intend to do
groundbreaking work here,

05:34.682 --> 05:37.424
but, as with any reorganization,
there are personnel changes.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.469
Oh... okay.

05:39.513 --> 05:43.473
I would like you to step up
as lab supervisor.

05:43.517 --> 05:44.735
Me?

05:44.779 --> 05:46.389
The work you're doing
with gene splicing

05:46.433 --> 05:48.739
dovetails beautifully with what
we're hoping to accomplish here.

05:48.783 --> 05:52.308
I truly believe gene splicing
is the future of bioengineering.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.920
Great. Well, that's
the good news.

05:55.964 --> 05:57.531
Here's the bad:

05:57.574 --> 06:01.709
I have a major budget shortfall
to deal with, which means...

06:03.667 --> 06:06.757
...we have to lay someone off.

06:13.982 --> 06:16.506
You're going to lay off
Galvin Burdette?

06:16.550 --> 06:18.029
No, you are.

06:18.987 --> 06:20.597
Is that a problem?

06:20.641 --> 06:23.426
It's just, we're friends.

06:25.515 --> 06:28.475
Dr. Vaughn, this is business,

06:28.518 --> 06:30.433
it's not personal.

06:30.477 --> 06:33.480
Look,

06:33.523 --> 06:35.569
men have conversations
like this all the time

06:35.612 --> 06:37.571
and then go golfing
together.

06:39.094 --> 06:40.487
Work it out.

06:44.055 --> 06:46.362
Yo, Vera, wait up.

06:47.711 --> 06:50.932
You're avoiding me.

06:50.975 --> 06:55.066
I haven't seen you in World Lit
since... everything.

06:55.110 --> 06:57.591
Yeah, I've just,
I've been really busy.

06:57.634 --> 07:00.724
Have you seen Lucy's group text?

07:09.733 --> 07:12.649
I know. Her flair for
the dramatic finally worked out

07:12.693 --> 07:15.347
in our favor.

07:15.391 --> 07:17.001
That smile,

07:17.045 --> 07:20.178
gets me every time.

07:20.222 --> 07:21.528
So now that we're in the clear,

07:21.571 --> 07:23.486
can I take you out
on a proper date?

07:23.530 --> 07:26.315
Okay.

07:26.358 --> 07:27.882
Um, no Beyoncé.

07:27.925 --> 07:29.361
What?

07:29.405 --> 07:33.148
What I meant was, nothing
too, um, public or fancy.

07:33.191 --> 07:34.976
Something low-key.

07:35.019 --> 07:36.978
How about I pick you up
after your shift

07:37.021 --> 07:38.196
at the restaurant tomorrow?

07:38.240 --> 07:41.025
You get off
around 2:00, right?

07:41.069 --> 07:42.374
How do you know that?

I'm not feeling inspired.

08:05.572 --> 08:08.313
Sounds like you need a muse.

08:11.926 --> 08:14.102
Can I get you anything?

08:14.145 --> 08:17.322
Nah, I was just
sitting over there,

08:17.366 --> 08:18.759
wanted to get a closer look.

08:20.456 --> 08:21.718
I...

08:21.762 --> 08:25.461

Who are you calling nerd?

08:56.274 --> 08:58.407
That'd be you, freshman.

08:58.450 --> 08:59.843
Please tell me
you picked your classes.

08:59.887 --> 09:00.888
Not yet.

09:00.931 --> 09:02.193
You're not seriously thinking

09:02.237 --> 09:03.368
about dropping out, are you?

09:03.412 --> 09:04.761
Mel, stop.

09:04.805 --> 09:06.284
I'm just thinking about it,
okay? Let me think.

09:06.328 --> 09:08.069
I just don't want to waste
the time and money,

09:08.112 --> 09:09.766
when I'm not even sure
what I want to do.

09:09.810 --> 09:11.376
Maggie.

09:12.639 --> 09:14.075
Ah, someone's at the door.
I got to go.

09:14.118 --> 09:15.816
Is someone really there or...Love you, bye.

09:22.170 --> 09:24.389
Hi. Can I...

09:24.433 --> 09:25.608
Charmed One.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.610
Please, help me.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.569
What

09:40.623 --> 09:44.192
Oh, he smells
like a wet dog.

09:44.235 --> 09:45.585
No-no shoes
on the couch.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.283
Oh, my God,
that's a goat!

09:48.326 --> 09:49.545
What the hell?

09:49.589 --> 09:50.720
Thank God you
summoned me.

09:50.764 --> 09:53.114
Ladies, this is
no mere mortal

09:53.157 --> 09:54.637
at your doorstep.

09:54.681 --> 09:56.073
He is a satyr.

09:56.117 --> 09:59.686
One of the class of lustful,
drunken woodland gods.

09:59.729 --> 10:01.035
Of course he is.

10:01.078 --> 10:03.951
Roll your eyes, Mel,
but if past experience

10:03.994 --> 10:06.170
is anything
to go by...

10:07.519 --> 10:10.784
...we're in for
a real treat.

10:14.831 --> 10:16.746
So it's true.

10:16.790 --> 10:18.879
The Charmed Ones
have been unbound.

10:20.532 --> 10:22.056
I'm sorry to come here
like this,

10:22.099 --> 10:24.406
but word is out in the magical
matrix-- if you need help,

10:24.449 --> 10:25.712
to come here.

10:25.755 --> 10:27.670
We'll invest in some
better home security.

10:27.714 --> 10:29.672
Oh, I'm just glad it's true.

10:29.716 --> 10:30.804
Part of me was
starting to worry

10:30.847 --> 10:31.805
you were just a myth.

10:31.848 --> 10:33.763
Mm. Back at ya,

10:33.807 --> 10:35.504
half

10:35.547 --> 10:36.636
Name's Leon.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.159
Oh.

10:38.202 --> 10:39.290
Please, sit. Sit.

10:39.334 --> 10:42.119
Harry Greenwood.
Acolyte for the Elders,

10:42.163 --> 10:44.339
Whitelighter to the...Yeah, yeah, yeah, no offense,

10:44.382 --> 10:46.602
but, uh, I came to see
the witches.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.082
What can we do for you?

10:48.125 --> 10:50.693
Earlier, there was a
power outage in my wine shop,

10:50.737 --> 10:53.130
and I couldn't see
what was happening.

10:53.174 --> 10:55.176
And then a shadowy figure
reached its hand

10:55.219 --> 10:58.179
into my stomach,
and it-it did this.

10:58.222 --> 10:59.310
MAGGIE:
Oh...

10:59.354 --> 11:02.009
Oh, my God.
Why?

11:02.052 --> 11:07.928
It knew my secret, something
I've never told another soul.

11:07.971 --> 11:11.932
I'm a sworn protector of a shard
of the Scythe of Tartarus.

11:11.975 --> 11:13.498
That's what caused
last night's hellquake.

11:15.239 --> 11:18.460
I thought the Scythe was lost.

11:18.503 --> 11:20.897
Sorry, what's the
Scythe of Tartarus?

11:20.941 --> 11:23.247
I thought you'd never ask.

11:32.430 --> 11:33.867
Uh...

11:37.087 --> 11:38.872
I told you.

11:38.915 --> 11:41.309
The, uh...

11:41.352 --> 11:46.749
Tartarus... a hellish prison
for magical creatures.

11:46.793 --> 11:49.926
Gods, demons, the Vanquished.

11:49.970 --> 11:53.103
It's where the bad guys
send theirbad guys.

11:53.147 --> 11:54.322
Famously, Apollo
was sent there by Zeus

11:54.365 --> 11:55.932
for killing a Cyclopes.

11:55.976 --> 11:57.412
Well, that Cyclopes did create
the lightning bolt

11:57.455 --> 11:59.283
that killed his son.

11:59.327 --> 12:01.938
Salut. Well done.World Lit.

12:01.982 --> 12:03.505
Nerd.

12:03.548 --> 12:06.421
Anyway, common understanding
is that Apollo's mom, Leto,

12:06.464 --> 12:08.379
was so distraught
that she took her scythe,

12:08.423 --> 12:11.078
and bang, and bang,
right on the ground

12:11.121 --> 12:14.211
where her son was taken, till
finally the ground gave way.

12:14.255 --> 12:16.170
And then, out he came.

12:16.213 --> 12:19.695
Zeus took the scythe and he
broke it into three shards,

12:19.739 --> 12:22.306
and he separated them,
entrusting one each

12:22.350 --> 12:24.091
to a sentinel.

12:24.134 --> 12:26.746
And, in case they ever needed
to be rejoined,

12:26.789 --> 12:28.008
he left behind a beacon

12:28.051 --> 12:29.661
that could call out
to the other three

12:29.705 --> 12:33.100
and bind them back together.

12:33.143 --> 12:37.060
I come from a long line of
sentinels on my mom's side.

12:37.104 --> 12:39.802
Once the Scythe is
fully reassembled,

12:39.846 --> 12:41.238
you can strike it on the ground

12:41.282 --> 12:43.501
and set any prisoner
in Tartarus free.

12:43.545 --> 12:47.810
Ladies, if we don't get ahead
of these other two shards,

12:47.854 --> 12:49.464
I'm afraid we're in for
a demonic jailbreak.

12:49.507 --> 12:53.076
And you've met the demons
that run loose.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.556
Imagine the ones they lock up.

12:57.124 --> 12:58.821
ALISTAIR:
Let me see.

13:02.651 --> 13:06.611
One down, two to go.

13:06.655 --> 13:11.486
I have tried every spell
and incantation.

13:14.881 --> 13:16.796
In

13:19.581 --> 13:21.713
Not even a chuckle, huh?

13:21.757 --> 13:24.978
Anyway, nothing seems to
open it.

13:25.021 --> 13:27.154
That damn witch wrote
a containment spell

13:27.197 --> 13:29.460
more powerful than anything
I have ever seen,

13:29.504 --> 13:33.073
and then the raw power of
the Charmed Ones fortified it.

13:35.031 --> 13:37.164
Get me those
other two shards.

13:37.207 --> 13:41.690
Someone in Tartarus must know
how to open this damned thing.

13:44.911 --> 13:47.000
Go.

13:57.749 --> 13:59.055
Hello.

13:59.099 --> 14:01.884
Did we really throw down
with a satyr last night?

14:01.928 --> 14:05.496
I don't know
what's real anymore.

14:05.540 --> 14:08.238
We've got work to do.

14:08.282 --> 14:10.588
Bottoms up.

14:10.632 --> 14:11.981
Harry's Hair of the Dog.

14:14.723 --> 14:16.072
Ah.

14:16.116 --> 14:18.074
This is really working.
What's in it?

14:18.118 --> 14:21.512
I told you, hair of dog.

14:21.556 --> 14:23.775
That is a violation.

14:23.819 --> 14:25.603
Okay, so what's the plan?

14:25.647 --> 14:28.606
Well, obviously,
people who are sworn

14:28.650 --> 14:30.695
to protect sacred objects
aren't in the business

14:30.739 --> 14:33.176
of letting people know
they have said objects,

14:33.220 --> 14:34.743
but we may have more luck

14:34.786 --> 14:36.310
tracking the demon.

14:36.353 --> 14:39.835
Macy, I need you
to test the residue

14:39.879 --> 14:41.532
from Leon's wound ASAP.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.795
Perhaps the demon left
some trace of itself

14:43.839 --> 14:44.927
that can narrow our search.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.363
And I will research
darkness demons,

14:46.407 --> 14:48.278
shadow demons and
see what we can find.

14:48.322 --> 14:50.585
I'll set a news alert to ding
if anyone in the area

14:50.628 --> 14:53.805
reports a blackout, seeing as
that is the demon's M.O.

14:53.849 --> 14:56.025
Clever.
We'll keep an eye on those,

14:56.069 --> 14:58.375
and also be aware of any
further seismic activity.

14:58.419 --> 15:00.290
That's how we'll know
another shard's been taken.

15:00.334 --> 15:02.336
In the meantime,

15:02.379 --> 15:05.774
back to your
normal lives.

15:05.817 --> 15:07.776
How are you not
hungover right now?

15:07.819 --> 15:11.780
I only had, like, four
or five glasses of wine.

15:11.823 --> 15:14.435
Ah, youth of today.

15:16.437 --> 15:18.047
I didn't think it
was possible to get

15:18.091 --> 15:19.919
this excited
about broccoli.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.616
You knew I was vegan.

15:21.659 --> 15:22.965
"Ish."

15:23.009 --> 15:25.098
Most guys don't notice
stuff like that.

15:25.141 --> 15:27.404
Or anything, really,

15:27.448 --> 15:29.929
but this is really perfect.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.974
Not too public,
not too fancy.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.758
Which wasn't easy, by the way.

15:33.802 --> 15:35.630
I had to fight every impulse
drilled into me by my dad.

15:35.673 --> 15:38.198
He's not a big fan of tofu?

15:38.241 --> 15:40.635
According to him,
it's not a meal unless

15:40.678 --> 15:41.984
it's on a white tablecloth
with at least

15:42.028 --> 15:43.290
three kinds of forks.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.901
Oh, my mom was, like,
the polar opposite.

15:45.945 --> 15:49.078
We did a lot of
grilled cheese...
Mmm.

15:49.122 --> 15:50.645
...empanadas, pizza.

15:50.688 --> 15:53.126
Basically, all your
non-fork food groups.

15:53.169 --> 15:54.388
What about your dad?

15:54.431 --> 15:57.782
My parents weren't
together very long.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.393
Neither were mine.

15:59.436 --> 16:01.438
My dad likes to say
his marriage to my mom

16:01.482 --> 16:03.310
was his biggest mistake.

16:03.353 --> 16:06.313
That's horrible.

16:06.356 --> 16:09.011
PARKER: Don't ruin this.

16:09.055 --> 16:10.491
We don't have to
talk about this.

16:10.534 --> 16:12.188
No, it's fine.

16:12.232 --> 16:14.843
I don't want to lie to
you about who I am, and...

16:14.886 --> 16:16.018
my dad's a part of that.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.324
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

16:17.367 --> 16:19.369
I know what it's like
to live in the shadow

16:19.413 --> 16:20.544
of a family legacy.

16:20.588 --> 16:23.156
Everyone in my family
has a PhD.

16:23.199 --> 16:25.201
And you don't want that?It's not that I don't want it.

16:25.245 --> 16:28.204
I'm just...
not like they are.

16:28.248 --> 16:29.510
How are they?

16:29.553 --> 16:32.078
You know, my sisters
both have these

16:32.121 --> 16:34.950
big intellectual passions
that they're so excited about,

16:34.994 --> 16:37.866
and, I mean, I've never
really had an idea

16:37.909 --> 16:39.781
of what kind of career
I want.

16:39.824 --> 16:43.176
But it's not like I can
really talk to them about it.

16:43.219 --> 16:46.744
Just like I'm sure
it's hard for you to

16:46.788 --> 16:48.920
open up to your dad about
who you really are

16:48.964 --> 16:50.357
without feeling like...

16:50.400 --> 16:52.054
PARKER: A real disappointment.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.450
You know what I mean?

16:56.493 --> 16:58.539
♪ When he calls me baby...

16:58.582 --> 17:00.062
My parents have made me see

17:00.106 --> 17:02.804
all kinds of shrinks
over the years.

17:02.847 --> 17:05.850
Many of them with PhDs,

17:05.894 --> 17:07.939
and none of them have
made me feel as understood

17:07.983 --> 17:10.420
as you did just now.

17:10.464 --> 17:13.684
That is a marketable skill.

17:13.728 --> 17:17.340
My sisters always tell me
I'm super empathic, so...

17:17.384 --> 17:19.473
♪ I'm just riding the waves

17:19.516 --> 17:23.694

17:32.355 --> 17:35.663
PARKER: I can't let her
find out the truth.

17:35.706 --> 17:38.448
Is something wrong?No.

17:43.410 --> 17:45.455
MACY: Maggie, it can't
have been that bad.

17:45.499 --> 17:48.023
It was. I mean,
I finally get to kiss Parker

17:48.067 --> 17:51.331
for real,
and just as I was about

17:51.374 --> 17:53.898
to go to town
on those pillow lips, I...

17:53.942 --> 17:55.552
:
That's an overshare.

17:55.596 --> 17:57.511
I read his thoughts and he has
some sort of deep, dark secret.

17:57.554 --> 17:58.947
Oh, yeah?

17:58.990 --> 18:01.123
His thoughts really said
"deep, dark secret"?

18:01.167 --> 18:03.734
Well, thoughts are complicated,
but that's the feeling I got.

18:03.778 --> 18:06.085
Listen, little sister,

18:06.128 --> 18:08.043
a dark thought doesn't
necessarily mean

18:08.087 --> 18:09.740
he's a dark person.

18:09.784 --> 18:11.655
Maybe it's just something
that's hard to say.

18:14.484 --> 18:16.225
But if there's anyone that can
get a person to open up,

18:16.269 --> 18:17.444
it's you.

18:17.487 --> 18:19.620
I'm sorry, but I got to go.

18:19.663 --> 18:22.188
Bye.

18:22.231 --> 18:24.755
GALVIN: I never got a chance
to officially congratulate you

18:24.799 --> 18:26.583
on your promotion. Cheers.

18:26.627 --> 18:28.411
Thanks.

18:28.455 --> 18:31.284
It's a little weird not just
being part of the team anymore.

18:31.327 --> 18:33.590
Listen. Gregorian
was a dick,

18:33.634 --> 18:35.984
Thaine was a straight-up
sexual predator.

18:36.027 --> 18:38.465
I'm all for having
some badass ladies taking over

18:38.508 --> 18:40.423
and righting the ship.
It's about damn time.

18:40.467 --> 18:41.990
Thanks. You know, I...And if you ever need

18:42.033 --> 18:43.774
help with the guys, please,
let me know. Okay?

18:43.818 --> 18:44.949
I've been around them
long enough,

18:44.993 --> 18:46.255
I've got a pretty good grasp

18:46.299 --> 18:47.952
on all their quirks.You definitely do.

18:47.996 --> 18:50.085
But I...You know what?
I've been doing

18:50.129 --> 18:51.826
some research on Julia,
and I can't figure out

18:51.869 --> 18:53.262
if she's more interested
in chromosomal

18:53.306 --> 18:55.221
or biochemical
genetics,

18:55.264 --> 18:56.787
so I brushed up on both.

18:56.831 --> 18:58.659
:
Of course you did.

19:00.008 --> 19:01.618
No.

19:01.662 --> 19:03.316
Look, Macy, I-I know
you wanted to talk,

19:03.359 --> 19:06.275
but Kretz needs my help
with his protein inhibitors.

19:07.537 --> 19:09.148
Catch you later?

19:11.846 --> 19:13.978
Hey, Jamie, have
you seen Parker?

19:14.022 --> 19:15.806
I just saw him
run into his room.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.852
Got it. Thanks.

19:28.863 --> 19:31.300
Hey, Parker, can I...?

19:33.389 --> 19:35.304
This is your big secret?

19:35.348 --> 19:37.176
Maggie.

19:38.307 --> 19:39.656
Maggie!

19:52.626 --> 19:55.629
Harry!

19:55.672 --> 19:58.327
Have you got something
to run by me, for your thesis?

19:58.371 --> 20:00.895
Nope. But if we're dealing
with a Shadow Demon,

20:00.938 --> 20:02.723
its weakness is something
called the Light of Theia.

20:02.766 --> 20:04.290
I found a spell.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.988
Mel, we haven't had any
hellquakes or power outages,

20:07.031 --> 20:08.990
which means right now
would be the perfect time

20:09.033 --> 20:10.383
to work on your thesis.

20:10.426 --> 20:12.472
I need another extension.

20:12.515 --> 20:14.604
Can I please have more time?

20:14.648 --> 20:16.258
No. The university won't let me.

20:18.956 --> 20:22.917
Look, you didn't hear it from
me, but if it's time you need,

20:22.960 --> 20:25.528
you do have your power.

20:25.572 --> 20:26.921
It would probably incur

20:26.964 --> 20:29.358
only minimal personal gain
consequences.

20:29.402 --> 20:31.360
Oh, so now the rules
don't matter.

20:32.666 --> 20:35.625
Another power outage.

20:35.669 --> 20:37.758
Sorry, Harry. Duty calls.

20:37.801 --> 20:39.238
Come on.

20:45.287 --> 20:48.769
Hello?

20:48.812 --> 20:52.381
Who's there?

20:52.425 --> 20:54.905
Show yourself.

21:12.314 --> 21:14.273
Anyone here?

21:14.316 --> 21:16.275
Whoa!

21:16.318 --> 21:17.972
Hellquake!

21:21.584 --> 21:23.238
What the hell?

21:27.111 --> 21:29.200
I knew this day was coming.

21:29.244 --> 21:31.855
This past week, I felt my
pendant-- that's where I keep

21:31.899 --> 21:36.295
my shard of the Scythe of
Tartarus-- I felt it vibrating.

21:36.338 --> 21:39.950
I mean, almost as if it was
calling out to the other pieces,

21:39.994 --> 21:42.692
like, like it wanted
to be reunited.

21:42.736 --> 21:47.131
So, wait. Are you a satyr, too?

21:47.175 --> 21:49.351
Do I look like a debaucherous
wine

21:49.395 --> 21:51.571
I am a Tawaret.

21:51.614 --> 21:52.789
HARRY: Sela's
a highly revered

21:52.833 --> 21:55.966
Egyptian fertility goddess.

21:56.010 --> 21:58.142
Practically royalty.

21:58.186 --> 21:59.318
Think Meghan Markle.

21:59.361 --> 22:01.102
Sorry.

22:01.145 --> 22:02.451
Wow, what an honor.

22:02.495 --> 22:05.019
Your, um, Goddess.

22:06.499 --> 22:08.022
They're new.

22:08.065 --> 22:10.024
Goddess?

22:10.067 --> 22:11.895
I keep thinking about
what Sela said

22:11.939 --> 22:13.810
about her shard reaching out
to the others.

22:13.854 --> 22:15.246
Well, they are magical.

22:15.290 --> 22:19.468
Ma-Magical, yes,
but maybe also magnetic?

22:19.512 --> 22:22.384
The vibrations,
the earthquakes.

22:22.428 --> 22:23.907
What if the Scythe
is made up

22:23.951 --> 22:25.996
of some form of Lodestone
and the pieces really are

22:26.040 --> 22:27.650
reaching out to each other
magnetically?

22:27.694 --> 22:29.652
Then could that be a way for
us to find the third shard

22:29.696 --> 22:30.827
before this demon does?

22:30.871 --> 22:32.655
Exactly. Now, if I can just...

22:35.528 --> 22:37.399
What the...?

22:39.619 --> 22:43.492
MAGGIE:
What is going on?

22:45.538 --> 22:48.584
Uh, ladies?
I-I should tell you I s-suffer

22:48.628 --> 22:52.762
from a mild case
of entomophobia.

22:52.806 --> 22:56.940
Fear of-of insects.

22:56.984 --> 22:58.289
What's happening?

22:58.333 --> 23:00.379
I really don't know.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.424
MACY:
I think I do.

23:02.468 --> 23:04.470
Bees are guided
by magnetoreception.

23:04.513 --> 23:08.299
It's a sort of magnetic North
Pole that helps them navigate.

23:08.343 --> 23:10.563
But why are they coming here?

23:10.606 --> 23:15.263
It must be because the last
shard of the Scythe...

23:15.306 --> 23:17.439
is in this house.

23:26.622 --> 23:29.408
MEL:
Wait.

23:29.451 --> 23:31.061
If there's a shard in our house,

23:31.105 --> 23:33.107
does that mean that Mom
was a sentinel?

23:33.150 --> 23:34.587
Impossible to know.

23:34.630 --> 23:36.632
Or that she once used
the Scythe?

23:36.676 --> 23:38.547
You think our mom staged
a prison break from Hell?

23:38.591 --> 23:40.636
Well, she did volunteer
with the Innocence Project.

23:41.942 --> 23:43.378
MAGGIE:
You guys, this is not

23:43.422 --> 23:45.249
the Beyhive I always imagined
showing up at our house.

23:45.293 --> 23:47.295
How do we get them to go away?

23:47.338 --> 23:49.471
We don't.

23:49.515 --> 23:51.125
We let them in.

23:51.168 --> 23:53.170
What

23:53.214 --> 23:56.173
When I said "mild fear,"

23:56.217 --> 23:58.611
I meant crippling.

23:58.654 --> 24:00.264
If we let them in,

24:00.308 --> 24:02.441
they should lead us
right to the third shard.

24:04.094 --> 24:06.967
All right. For the team.

24:26.813 --> 24:28.815
MACY:
They're going to the attic.

24:35.038 --> 24:37.650
Let's get in formation.

24:44.134 --> 24:46.136
Right behind you.

24:49.183 --> 24:52.012
I knew it.
They led us right to it.

25:02.239 --> 25:04.198
I know I keep saying this,

25:04.241 --> 25:06.330
but how did we not
know Mom was a witch?

25:18.125 --> 25:20.562
Um, guys?

25:23.260 --> 25:25.132
Macy, there's a bee
in your shirt!Oh, my...

25:25.175 --> 25:26.176
Oh, take it out!

25:34.707 --> 25:36.535
Whoa.

25:46.327 --> 25:47.981
Whoa.
Maggie.

25:48.024 --> 25:49.417
The key.What?

25:49.460 --> 25:51.027
Where did you get it?

25:51.071 --> 25:52.551
Uh...

25:54.161 --> 25:55.597
I've been wearing it.

25:55.641 --> 25:58.513
I... I found it
about a week ago.

25:58.557 --> 26:01.168
A week ago-- oh, dear God.

26:01.211 --> 26:04.998
Wait. That's the key
Mom was wearing in the '80s.

26:05.041 --> 26:07.043
You saw Mom in the '80s?

26:07.087 --> 26:09.524
You found a magical key
and you didn't tell us?

26:09.568 --> 26:12.309
Mel, I didn't know,
I... I was processing a lot.

26:12.353 --> 26:13.833
HARRY:
Yes, but this

26:13.876 --> 26:15.312
is Zeus's beacon, the one
thing that can awaken

26:15.356 --> 26:16.966
the Scythe of Tartarus.

26:17.010 --> 26:19.142
Somehow the demon must be
tuned in to the frequency

26:19.186 --> 26:22.406
of the shards, and it only
began hunting for them

26:22.450 --> 26:25.888
after you found this
and activated it.

26:25.932 --> 26:28.587
I didn't say anything
because I was ashamed

26:28.630 --> 26:30.371
of what the key
might have meant.

26:30.414 --> 26:34.201
Macy, you can always talk to us
about this stuff.

26:34.244 --> 26:36.420
Ladies, as much as I enjoy
our emotional heart-to-hearts,

26:36.464 --> 26:38.161
now may not be the best time.

26:38.205 --> 26:41.425
That Shadow Demon will be
cutting our power any minute.

26:41.469 --> 26:43.123
We need to come up with a plan.

26:45.778 --> 26:48.737
♪ With the wind

26:48.781 --> 26:51.740
♪ Oh, oh...

26:51.784 --> 26:53.089
MAGGIE:
We know the Shadow Demon

26:53.133 --> 26:54.743
wants the last shard
of the Scythe.

26:54.787 --> 26:57.093
Let's use that against him.

26:57.137 --> 27:01.010
♪ Oh...

27:01.054 --> 27:05.754
MACY: He wants to fight us
in the dark.

27:05.798 --> 27:09.279
Esto semper lux.

27:09.323 --> 27:12.543
MEL:
We won't let that happen.

27:19.725 --> 27:23.337
No demon is breaking out
of Tartarus on our watch.

27:39.353 --> 27:42.356
It's here.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.298
We call upon Theia,
goddess of light.

28:11.341 --> 28:13.735
She who persisted,
she who could fight.

28:13.779 --> 28:16.869
Give us the strength
to brighten this night.

28:16.912 --> 28:18.087
Now finish it.

28:24.920 --> 28:27.793
MAGGIE: He's trying to call
the other shard!

28:30.621 --> 28:32.101
The shard!
Mel!

28:35.583 --> 28:37.454
Maggie!

28:46.812 --> 28:48.509
Oh, come on!

29:01.827 --> 29:03.306
Frickin' Lodestone.

29:15.971 --> 29:17.886
MAGGIE: Wait.
I know what you're feeling.

29:17.930 --> 29:19.932
You're in pain.

29:22.804 --> 29:23.805
Macy!

29:23.849 --> 29:24.937
On it.

29:27.330 --> 29:28.462
I'll take that.

29:28.505 --> 29:32.205
Mel!

29:32.248 --> 29:35.077
Thanks.

29:35.121 --> 29:36.644
You...

29:44.565 --> 29:47.263
Are you okay?

29:47.307 --> 29:49.700
Just as planned, right?

30:01.234 --> 30:04.628
Thank you.

30:04.672 --> 30:06.979
I've seen that woman before.

30:07.022 --> 30:08.807
She flirted with
me at The Haunt.

30:08.850 --> 30:11.374
So she's a demon?

30:11.418 --> 30:13.681
Stealing the Scythe
would seem to indicate demon.

30:13.724 --> 30:16.205
The teleporting would
suggest something else.

30:16.249 --> 30:18.164
Well, not a Whitelighter?

30:18.207 --> 30:22.864
No. Then again, she didn't
try and kill us all, so...

30:22.908 --> 30:24.474
I don't know.

30:24.518 --> 30:26.346
Well, she now has
the Scythe and the power

30:26.389 --> 30:27.738
to break a demon
out of Tartarus.

30:27.782 --> 30:30.350
Not if we find her first.How do we do that?

30:30.393 --> 30:31.830
I'll follow up
with the Elder council.

30:31.873 --> 30:32.874
In the meantime...

30:32.918 --> 30:34.180
SISTERS:
Stay vigilant.

30:35.050 --> 30:36.704
Okay, so stay vigilant, yes.

30:36.747 --> 30:38.880
But can we take a minute
to appreciate

30:38.924 --> 30:40.534
the fact that my powers
are escalating?

30:40.577 --> 30:42.753
I read a demon's feelings.

30:42.797 --> 30:45.321
It was almost as if there was
some human part of it,

30:45.365 --> 30:46.322
if that's even possible.

30:46.366 --> 30:47.715
It may be.

30:47.758 --> 30:49.412
Consider how
you reached Angela Wu

30:49.456 --> 30:51.197
when she was possessed
by the Harbinger.

30:51.240 --> 30:54.591
Perhaps you reached some last
shred of humanity in this demon.

30:54.635 --> 30:58.247
Basically gave the demon therapy
and that's why it took off.

30:58.291 --> 31:00.380
Go, Mags.

31:00.423 --> 31:02.861
HARRY: Will you please
let me look at your shoulder

31:02.904 --> 31:04.688
or do you plan
on keeping up

31:04.732 --> 31:07.082
this martyr routine?

31:07.126 --> 31:09.215
It's just a scratch.

31:10.303 --> 31:11.782
Come on.

31:11.826 --> 31:13.001
Fine.

31:16.396 --> 31:18.789
Oh, my God.

31:18.833 --> 31:20.574
It's the same mark
that was found on Mom's body.

31:20.617 --> 31:22.793
Does that mean...?

31:22.837 --> 31:24.534
We just met her killer?

31:25.666 --> 31:27.407
She certainly could be.

31:27.450 --> 31:29.409
Leave it!
Are you sure?

31:29.452 --> 31:32.542
It reminds me of Mom
and why I'm doing this.

31:36.285 --> 31:38.722
If I had just been honest

31:38.766 --> 31:40.681
and told you about the key,

31:40.724 --> 31:42.465
this wouldn't have happened.

31:42.509 --> 31:43.902
Yeah, and if we'd told you
about the key

31:43.945 --> 31:45.947
Mom was wearing
in the '80s, same deal.

31:45.991 --> 31:48.036
So...

31:48.080 --> 31:51.910
So... from now on, we
tell each other everything.

31:53.607 --> 31:55.696
No matter how
scary it seems.

31:58.568 --> 32:00.962
What?

32:01.006 --> 32:03.878
There's something else.

32:03.922 --> 32:07.099
Not just the key.

32:07.142 --> 32:08.796
It was something that Mom said.

32:08.839 --> 32:11.451
Okay.

32:11.494 --> 32:13.670
What did she say?

32:16.151 --> 32:20.112
She was pregnant.

32:20.155 --> 32:22.810
And she thought there was
something wrong with her baby.

32:24.159 --> 32:26.901
You mean me.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.643
Yeah, but we don't... we
don't know what she meant.

32:29.686 --> 32:31.906
I know what it means.

32:31.950 --> 32:34.300
That must be why she gave me up.

32:34.343 --> 32:36.128
She sensed some evil in me.

32:36.171 --> 32:37.651
Don't jump
to that conclusion.

32:37.694 --> 32:39.435
We have no idea
what she meant,

32:39.479 --> 32:41.481
or how that key connects to you.

32:42.873 --> 32:46.051
But we do know
that Mom loved you

32:46.094 --> 32:48.183
and she wanted you back.

32:50.055 --> 32:52.013
She got you hired
at the lab, right?

32:52.057 --> 32:54.450
That's quite right.

32:57.453 --> 33:00.326
None of this explains
what this "darkness" even is.

33:02.328 --> 33:05.331
But Mom sensed it.

33:05.374 --> 33:07.507
And I feel it.

33:07.550 --> 33:12.033
I have been watching
human behavior for decades.

33:12.077 --> 33:14.383
Everyone has the capacity
for darkness.

33:16.429 --> 33:18.953
It's your actions,

33:18.997 --> 33:20.999
not your nature,
that defines you.

33:32.575 --> 33:34.186
I don't want to fire Galvin.

33:34.229 --> 33:36.231
You don't like
being the boss?

33:36.275 --> 33:38.712
No, I love being the boss.

33:38.755 --> 33:42.237
So much so, I was going to let
my ambition cloud my judgment.

33:42.281 --> 33:45.197
But I don't play golf.

33:45.240 --> 33:47.851
And we don't have to play
by those rules anymore.

33:49.462 --> 33:51.725
I'm listening.

33:51.768 --> 33:54.075
Yes, Galvin costs more

33:54.119 --> 33:56.730
than some of our other
scientists, but he's worth it.

33:56.773 --> 33:58.732
He's a team player and a leader.

33:58.775 --> 34:01.213
The whole lab suffers
if we lose him,

34:01.256 --> 34:03.084
and that's not very
cost-effective.

34:05.260 --> 34:07.480
That's quite an endorsement.

34:07.523 --> 34:10.265
But I still have a major
budget shortfall to deal with.I know.

34:10.309 --> 34:12.180
I've been studying up
on the new equipment.

34:12.224 --> 34:15.009
I think I can save
thousands of dollars

34:15.053 --> 34:16.837
from our biochemical budget

34:16.880 --> 34:18.099
if we can test
things in-house.

34:18.143 --> 34:19.970
That still leaves...About 40K.

34:20.014 --> 34:23.496
If I can save you that,
are we good?

34:25.150 --> 34:26.760
Yes.

34:26.803 --> 34:28.240
We're good.

34:28.283 --> 34:30.285
O-Okay, great.

34:42.993 --> 34:45.300
MACY:
Kretz...

34:45.344 --> 34:46.388
we need to talk.

34:50.740 --> 34:52.307
♪ Pain is like
a rose garden... ♪

34:52.351 --> 34:53.917
MAGGIE:
I did it.

34:53.961 --> 34:58.487
I signed up
for next semester.

34:58.531 --> 35:00.402
So that makes three
overachieving academics

35:00.446 --> 35:01.664
in the house.

35:01.708 --> 35:02.796
Two academics...

35:02.839 --> 35:06.016
and one overeducated
bartender.

35:06.060 --> 35:07.801
I'm dropping out.

35:07.844 --> 35:10.238
You're dropping out?

35:10.282 --> 35:11.587
Why?

35:11.631 --> 35:14.460
I lost everything.

35:14.503 --> 35:18.159
Mom, Niko, my job.

35:18.203 --> 35:21.249
And I guess it
gave me clarity

35:21.293 --> 35:23.121
on what wasn't
working in my life.

35:23.164 --> 35:27.603
Harry's right: people do
what they want to do.

35:27.647 --> 35:29.170
And my thesis,

35:29.214 --> 35:31.651
this academic career
I was so sure I wanted...

35:31.694 --> 35:35.611
Maybe it was more about
following in Mom's footsteps.

35:35.655 --> 35:38.048
And I'm just not sure
I want that anymore.

35:38.092 --> 35:41.530
So until I figure
out what I do want,

35:41.574 --> 35:44.185
I've got other ways
to honor Mom.

35:44.229 --> 35:46.187
I get it.

35:48.885 --> 35:51.149
So does that make me
the smart one now?

35:51.192 --> 35:53.020
Mm, that depends.

35:53.063 --> 35:55.153
What classes
are you taking?

35:55.196 --> 35:57.720
I'm thinking psych major.

35:59.548 --> 36:00.984
If I'm gonna
be reading minds,

36:01.028 --> 36:03.683
it'd be helpful
to understand them better.

36:03.726 --> 36:07.991
And maybe it'll help me
understand my own...

36:08.035 --> 36:10.124
so I don't get completely played
by a frat douche.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.518
Thanks.

36:12.561 --> 36:13.997
Good chat.

36:17.305 --> 36:19.568
Please! Let me explain.

36:21.353 --> 36:24.225
If you still want to slam
the door in my face

36:24.269 --> 36:26.271
after you hear me out, fine.

36:37.891 --> 36:40.154
What you saw wasn't
about drugs,

36:40.198 --> 36:43.810
it was about...
medicine.

36:45.290 --> 36:47.466
I need the injections
to stay healthy.

36:47.509 --> 36:49.511
Medicine? I...

36:51.165 --> 36:53.559
I have a rare
autoimmune disorder.

36:53.602 --> 36:55.256
I won't bore you
with the details,

36:55.300 --> 36:56.475
but it's serious

36:56.518 --> 36:58.781
and I'm always
gonna have it.

37:01.131 --> 37:03.699
If I'm lucky, I'll
make it to 40.

37:05.223 --> 37:08.138
Oh, my God.

37:08.182 --> 37:10.924
Parker... why didn't you
just tell me?

37:10.967 --> 37:13.056
I don't know.

37:13.100 --> 37:16.495
Shame, I guess.

37:16.538 --> 37:18.497
I mean, that's how I
feel about being sick.

37:18.540 --> 37:20.020
Like it's some
kind of weakness.

37:20.063 --> 37:23.284
My family doesn't
want anyone to know.

37:23.328 --> 37:26.418
So I haven't told anyone.

37:26.461 --> 37:31.074
Not Lucy, not the
Phi Delts... no one.

37:33.425 --> 37:35.470
I don't want to be a drag
on anyone's good time.

37:36.471 --> 37:39.431
I'm here.

37:39.474 --> 37:41.476
I'm not going anywhere.

37:51.356 --> 37:53.183
PARKER: I'm so glad
I told her the truth.

37:54.184 --> 37:55.490
She's everything.

38:09.287 --> 38:13.073
I don't see
the Scythe of Tartarus.

38:15.510 --> 38:19.035
Sorry, Dad, it... got away.

38:19.079 --> 38:21.081
Oh.

38:21.124 --> 38:23.649
Itgot away?

38:23.692 --> 38:26.347
Like, on its own?
No. There was...

38:26.391 --> 38:28.480
I don't know...
an electricity demon?

38:28.523 --> 38:31.047
Oh, really?

38:31.091 --> 38:32.658
Electricity?

38:32.701 --> 38:35.182
She beat me to it
at the last second.

38:35.225 --> 38:39.665
I should've sent
your brother, Hunter.

38:39.708 --> 38:42.494
Never send a half-demon
to do a full-demon's job.

38:42.537 --> 38:44.060
Hunter failed
his last mission, too.

38:44.104 --> 38:46.062
He was thwarted by a shift
in the time stream.

38:46.106 --> 38:47.194
You were, what?

38:47.237 --> 38:50.458
Bested by
a common bolt thrower?

38:53.896 --> 38:58.727
We will have to find
a new way to open it.

38:58.771 --> 39:02.688
But in the meantime,
you need to use that Vera girl.

39:02.731 --> 39:04.385
Dad, please.

39:04.429 --> 39:06.518
You promised me nothing more
after I got the Scythe.

39:06.561 --> 39:08.563
Are you whining?

39:10.652 --> 39:12.306
What is her power?

39:14.482 --> 39:16.615
Her power.

39:19.879 --> 39:21.794
She's an empath.

39:21.837 --> 39:24.449
Well...

39:24.492 --> 39:28.844
Now that is actually
something we can use.

39:34.067 --> 39:38.463
Don't fail me again...
son.
