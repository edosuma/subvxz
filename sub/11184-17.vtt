00:04.171 --> 00:06.048
String, chopper, dead ahead!

00:06.106 --> 00:07.949
Next, on Airwolf.

00:08.007 --> 00:10.181
You're gonna like the new operation, Chester.

00:10.244 --> 00:12.224
You tricked me into running that poison once.

00:12.279 --> 00:14.190
There's money in that powder.

00:14.248 --> 00:16.056
There's not a soul in sight, Dominic.

00:16.116 --> 00:17.959
Let's take her in.

00:18.151 --> 00:20.631
We got to stop him. He's the
one who killed my uncle.

00:20.687 --> 00:21.825
Kevin!

00:22.122 --> 00:23.294
Caitlin, help!

00:23.357 --> 00:24.734
I'm trying, Kevin.

00:24.791 --> 00:26.031
Hurry!

00:26.360 --> 00:27.805
Force him down.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074

01:37.331 --> 01:38.605
Come along, ladies.

01:38.665 --> 01:42.010
It's still not too late to enter your
pies and cakes in the baking contest.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.240
Step right up!

01:45.305 --> 01:47.478
There's always room for one more!

01:47.574 --> 01:50.851
There's nothing to worry about!
Bring the wife and kids!

01:50.911 --> 01:52.618
Safe as a buggy ride!

01:52.679 --> 01:55.922
Don't forget, it's all for charity.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.519
Yes, siree.

01:57.584 --> 02:00.861
That's a modern-day bicycle up there.

02:15.936 --> 02:16.937
Kevin!

02:41.828 --> 02:44.809
Kevin, I'm gonna die if you don't stop.

02:45.265 --> 02:47.108
What's the matter? Don't you like it?

02:47.167 --> 02:49.647
No, I love it! It's outrageous!

03:03.650 --> 03:05.721
Oh, my gosh!

03:05.786 --> 03:09.097
I've never done anything like this in my life!

03:11.825 --> 03:14.601
Hey, wait’ll you get a load of this one.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.904
Hey, watch this, no hands.

03:23.970 --> 03:25.449
Oh my God!

03:25.505 --> 03:26.779
Oh Kevin,

03:27.074 --> 03:28.985
do you have your seat belt on?

03:30.744 --> 03:32.485
Oh, my gosh!

03:41.321 --> 03:42.561
Kevin!

03:43.457 --> 03:44.663
Kevin!

03:47.694 --> 03:49.002
Kevin!

04:01.108 --> 04:03.145
String, chopper, dead ahead!

04:03.210 --> 04:04.450
Yeah, I got it.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.750
Whoa! What was that thing?

04:08.815 --> 04:09.850
What?

04:09.916 --> 04:12.556
Whoa! Some big, black huge thing.

04:12.619 --> 04:14.394
Kevin, don't try to scare me.

04:14.454 --> 04:15.797
Oh, man!

04:17.324 --> 04:20.202
Phew, that was close.

04:22.629 --> 04:25.132
Yeah, we gave him a stiff
one on that flyby, Dom.

04:25.198 --> 04:26.370
Let's go back and check it out.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.912
You're the teacher.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.030
Oh my God!, I mean gosh.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.763
Who are those guys?

05:24.891 --> 05:26.837
Oh man, oh man, oh man.

05:26.893 --> 05:28.429
You should have seen it, Uncle Chester.

05:28.495 --> 05:31.499
I was about to do a side roll when out
of nowhere this incredible chopper…

05:31.565 --> 05:34.273
I've seen plenty and so have
them people over there.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.144
I had to give back $60 worth of tickets.

05:38.572 --> 05:39.846
And you, young lady.

05:39.906 --> 05:42.580
That's the last time you're ever
going up in one of those things.

05:42.642 --> 05:45.282
Dad, that's not fair.
Kevin was always in control,

05:45.345 --> 05:47.222
even when he was flying with his feet.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.384
No more.

05:48.481 --> 05:51.360
Damn it, boy. We would've
taken in well over $200 today.

05:51.418 --> 05:53.125
And half of that would've been ours.

05:53.186 --> 05:56.690
That showboating of yours is gonna
get you in serious trouble some day.

05:56.756 --> 05:58.235
But if you only saw what I saw up there…

05:58.291 --> 06:00.237
I don't wanna hear it!

06:08.668 --> 06:10.579
I'll get you next time.

06:13.306 --> 06:16.185
Do you have any idea why I
paid down on this place?

06:16.243 --> 06:18.223
Yeah, sure. It's like you said.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.622
“You can't barnstorm all year long, son.”

06:20.680 --> 06:23.524
“You got to have a place to
hold up in, come wintertime.”

06:23.583 --> 06:26.689
Yeah, a person needs a permanent place.

06:26.753 --> 06:28.790
But that's not the real reason.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.100
The real reason is you.

06:31.157 --> 06:33.262
I ain't done right by you, son.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.704
Sure you have. What are you talking about?

06:35.762 --> 06:37.435
Nobody's had a better life than us.

06:37.497 --> 06:39.909
Barnstorm’n, air shows, county fairs.

06:39.966 --> 06:41.912
Anywhere the wind blows is all right

06:41.968 --> 06:43.743
for an old air gypsy like me.

06:43.803 --> 06:46.875
That's why I'm telling you,
flying ain't everyth’n.

06:47.173 --> 06:48.447
Wait a minute. That's not what you…

06:48.508 --> 06:50.579
Just hold on, don't disturb me.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.582
Flying ain't everyth’n.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.023
People are.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.185
And you're gonna have to start pay’n attention.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.160
Well, what kind of attention?

06:58.685 --> 07:03.031
Kev, you are the best damn natural-born
pilot I ever saw in my life.

07:03.456 --> 07:05.493
It's a God-given gift.

07:05.792 --> 07:08.432
You sure as hell didn't get it from me.

07:08.695 --> 07:12.040
Why, you're twice the pilot
I am now or ever was.

07:12.365 --> 07:13.844
You're the best.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.013
But along with that comes responsibility, too.

07:17.337 --> 07:21.080
First, the safety of the people's
lives that's in your hands.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.182
Yesterday you violated that trust,

07:23.243 --> 07:25.382
and that's why I'm ground’n you.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.083
For what? You can't tell me what to do.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.923
Your wings are clipped until I say otherwise.

07:29.983 --> 07:33.795
Now, take this in the back and
soak this unit one more time.

07:43.563 --> 07:45.565
Hansen Helicopter.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.543
Sure, I know the name.

07:47.667 --> 07:51.376
Yeah, you tell O'Donnell the answer's
the same now as it was then.

07:51.571 --> 07:54.074
It's a flat “No” and “No discussion.”

07:54.908 --> 07:57.548
Oh, he's coming up? That's fine.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.715
Then I'll tell him in person.

08:03.049 --> 08:05.893
Look Unc, I'm sorry about
all that stuff before.

08:06.619 --> 08:09.259
And I thought about what
you said and everything.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.769
Well, I'm not saying this because
you grounded me or anything.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.869
And well,

08:15.161 --> 08:17.163
I'll be more careful next time.

08:19.599 --> 08:20.771
So,

08:21.501 --> 08:25.472
well, you think I can still take the
chopper up to Pine Lake this weekend?

08:26.439 --> 08:28.680
Boy, you're good at a lot of things,

08:28.875 --> 08:31.446
but when it comes to being a con artist,

08:31.511 --> 08:34.491
you're Texas league all the way.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.423
Now you get your sorry butt into town,

08:39.486 --> 08:42.296
pick up the lug nuts at the express office.

08:42.722 --> 08:45.669
Yeah, but you said at least
2 weeks minimum on those.

08:45.725 --> 08:46.999
Humor me.

08:48.094 --> 08:49.573
I'm an old man.

09:27.333 --> 09:28.403
Damn.

09:29.502 --> 09:30.708
Winter.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.282
Kevin, we need to talk.

09:33.339 --> 09:36.479
Well, if it's about this weekend, I think
I can still pull it off. My uncle…

09:36.543 --> 09:38.887
Kevin, you're not letting me talk.

09:39.045 --> 09:41.924
My Father says that I can't
go out with you anymore.

09:41.981 --> 09:44.359
What, because of that little
stunt at the church fair?

09:44.417 --> 09:45.725
Not just that, Kevin.

09:45.785 --> 09:48.561
He thinks you're too wild and too reckless.

09:48.988 --> 09:50.228
And what do you think?

09:50.290 --> 09:52.896
That you're too wild and too reckless.

09:53.626 --> 09:55.628
But I still like you, anyway.

09:55.695 --> 09:56.867
A lot.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.637
Come on, you know I never do any stunt

09:58.698 --> 10:01.770
unless I've practiced it
at least 100 times before.

10:02.569 --> 10:04.913
Let me talk to your Father, all right?

10:07.207 --> 10:08.652
Winter.

10:08.908 --> 10:10.649
Hey, we got to get going.

10:11.411 --> 10:12.651
Call me.

10:13.746 --> 10:15.191
He's so cute.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.285
No, I'll call you.

10:18.084 --> 10:19.188
Bye.

10:29.662 --> 10:31.107
Doggone it.

10:31.431 --> 10:34.275
Our generators are just fine
for a few light bulbs,

10:34.334 --> 10:38.510
but I need a precise cycle
to fix that radar image.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.917
Can't fix it, huh?

10:40.974 --> 10:42.248
Not here.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.881
And we're really blind flying
at turbo speed without it.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.320
Well, how about back at the
hangar, could you fix it there?

10:49.382 --> 10:50.952
Sure, piece of cake.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.893
In and out, overnight.

10:55.121 --> 10:56.794
Let's hope so.

11:36.796 --> 11:39.208
You've come a long way, Chester.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.611
Yes, sir.

11:42.101 --> 11:44.707
A long way from some of those
days down in the Yucatan.

11:44.771 --> 11:46.751
No thanks to you, Jake.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.184
I never told you it was gonna be a party.

11:50.243 --> 11:53.884
No, you never told me about the
Mexican brown either, did you?

11:54.247 --> 11:56.659
There's money in that powder.

11:57.016 --> 11:59.997
There was then, and there is now.

12:00.086 --> 12:02.999
Look, you tricked me into
run’n that poison once.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.229
I ain't about to do it again.

12:05.291 --> 12:06.702
You know where the door is.

12:12.498 --> 12:14.671
Would you look at that?

12:17.704 --> 12:20.844
You weren't so choosy in the old days.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.746
Some good times after the war.

12:24.811 --> 12:27.985
Cross’n the border with a load
of cigarettes is one thing.

12:28.047 --> 12:30.118
But drugs, heroin,

12:31.050 --> 12:32.495
that's another.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.488
I draw the line.

12:34.554 --> 12:37.433
You're gonna like the new operation, Chester.

12:37.991 --> 12:41.996
We've moved on to bigger and better things.

12:42.262 --> 12:46.108
2 years, you can retire to a Swiss lake.

12:46.866 --> 12:49.540
And a man your age should
be thinking about that.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.411
You ain't hear’n me, Jake.

12:51.971 --> 12:53.575
The answer's no.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.283
It wasn't a question.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.987
You know too much about us, Chester.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.317
And I never leave loose ends,

13:02.649 --> 13:05.061
so give me your final answer.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.498
So long, Jake.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.233
So long, Chester.

14:02.041 --> 14:04.487
Yeah, yeah, I'm approaching the fire now.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.546
Looks like I've got an injured man down here.

14:06.612 --> 14:09.183
Let's get a medical unit out here right away.

14:15.488 --> 14:18.435
I'll take care of you. You'll
be all right. It's okay.

14:20.326 --> 14:22.533
Come on! Hurry!

14:23.563 --> 14:26.271
Help him. Come on, help him!

14:26.833 --> 14:29.177
This looks like a gunshot wound.

14:34.340 --> 14:36.946
There's nothing I can do. He's gone. I'm sorry.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.717
Is there anyone left inside?

14:43.116 --> 14:45.153
Is there anyone left in there?

14:52.425 --> 14:54.530
They killed him, they did.

15:02.168 --> 15:05.047
Hey! Hey, what the hell are you do’n? Hey!

16:00.493 --> 16:03.030
We've got company, 3 o’clock.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.770
We can outrun him.

16:07.834 --> 16:10.314
But we can't outrun his radio.

17:09.595 --> 17:11.700
I was so worried about you.

17:12.231 --> 17:15.007
The police were here. Everybody's
been looking for you.

17:16.269 --> 17:19.079
After what happened,
nobody can blame you, Kevin.

17:19.605 --> 17:21.448
You have to turn yourself in.

17:21.507 --> 17:22.747
I can't!

17:25.344 --> 17:27.790
I gotta find the ones who did this.

17:28.446 --> 17:31.155
But you don't even know anything about them.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.858
Maybe I do know something about ‘em.

17:37.790 --> 17:40.862
Kevin, talk to my Father.
He'll know what to do.

17:40.993 --> 17:42.995
Winter, come down here.
I want you to see something.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.473
I gotta go.

17:45.231 --> 17:48.235
And just remember, if you
hear bad things about me…

17:48.501 --> 17:50.037
Just come back.

17:59.145 --> 18:00.920
Please be careful.

18:37.683 --> 18:39.492
Thanks for the ride, sir.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.012
Before my time, kid.

19:00.072 --> 19:03.053
You better go see Dominic
Santini down at Santini Air.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.053
He's been around since the Wright brothers.

19:05.111 --> 19:06.613
Thank you, sir.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.139
- Damn!
- Excuse me, sir.

19:24.196 --> 19:25.903
Yeah, what do you want?

19:25.965 --> 19:27.000
I just…

19:27.066 --> 19:28.602
Well come on son, speak up.

19:28.668 --> 19:31.239
How can he, when you're bellow’n like that?

19:31.904 --> 19:33.247
You about to get this thing fixed?

19:33.305 --> 19:34.750
Well, I'm work’n on it.

19:34.807 --> 19:35.842
Dom!

19:35.908 --> 19:36.943
What now?

19:37.009 --> 19:39.956
Dom, I've got that ad executive on
the phone. He wants a 3rd chopper,

19:40.012 --> 19:43.050
you know, to give this aerial ballet
the size it requires for his product.

19:43.115 --> 19:46.460
What product? It's a bathtub detergent.

19:46.519 --> 19:50.865
Mamma mia, now he wants 3
choppers plus a Stearman.

19:51.090 --> 19:53.696
What does he think I am, an airline?

19:55.394 --> 19:58.170
Dom, I think this guy wants to talk to you.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.172
I'll just come back when you're not so busy.

20:02.268 --> 20:05.477
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on back
later when I'm not so busy.

20:05.938 --> 20:07.008
Thanks, man.

20:07.073 --> 20:08.416
Hey, hold on.

20:08.574 --> 20:11.953
Hey, Dom, what if he's a messenger
bringing you a dividend check

20:12.011 --> 20:15.356
for those olive oil futures
you bought last year, huh?

20:15.614 --> 20:18.026
Now, why did you have to say that, huh?

20:18.084 --> 20:19.825
You know, you have a real talent

20:19.885 --> 20:23.196
for reminding me of things that
I don't wanna be reminded of!

20:23.989 --> 20:26.731
Don't mind these two. They just get
started like that in the morning.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.169
Now, what can we do for you?

20:28.227 --> 20:31.003
Well, I was looking
for any of these men here.

20:35.434 --> 20:36.435
What?

20:39.371 --> 20:41.874
Oh, the old Skyways Inn.

20:42.808 --> 20:45.880
The great times there after the war.

20:46.512 --> 20:49.584
Yeah, was that the Spanish-American
or the Boer War?

20:52.518 --> 20:54.862
What are you look’n for these guys for?

20:55.621 --> 20:57.828
My uncle worked with ‘em once.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.563
He wanted me to look ‘em up.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.097
Sorry kid, I can't help ya.

21:05.164 --> 21:07.906
What did your uncle want
you to look ‘em up for?

21:07.967 --> 21:09.139
A job.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.009
I could use some work.

21:11.070 --> 21:13.107
Yeah well, good luck, kid.

21:13.506 --> 21:14.678
Thanks.

21:17.209 --> 21:19.655
That kid looks like he hasn't eaten for a week.

21:21.147 --> 21:22.558
Hey, son.

21:24.150 --> 21:26.528
We could probably use some help around here.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.893
Our maintenance man didn't show up, you know.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.559
Maintenance man…!? I'm the…

21:32.691 --> 21:35.570
We could use the office swept
out, a few things like that.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.164
You think you can handle it?

21:39.398 --> 21:42.607
Well come on, I'll show
you where everything is.

21:42.701 --> 21:45.204
Get him started, will you?

21:45.805 --> 21:49.446
Now look String, I got a soft
spot just like the next guy,

21:49.508 --> 21:51.510
but we are not running a handout service

21:51.577 --> 21:54.217
for every kid that comes down the pike.

21:54.346 --> 21:56.417
Well, if he earns it, it's not a handout.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.291
Besides,

21:58.818 --> 22:01.162
if I know you, he'll earn it.

22:13.899 --> 22:17.574
Don't forget to get those iron filings
down there by that workbench.

22:17.636 --> 22:19.274
I already got ‘em.

22:19.572 --> 22:23.019
All right, drop what you're
do’n and come on over here.

22:29.648 --> 22:32.652
Here you go. Now wrap yourself around that.

22:35.721 --> 22:37.723
Hey, this is pretty special.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.997
It's not every day the boss makes lunch.

22:40.059 --> 22:41.970
You can say that again.

22:45.564 --> 22:47.237
Mamma mia.

22:48.434 --> 22:50.038
Hello, Bert!

22:50.102 --> 22:52.605
Santini, you did get my message?

22:52.671 --> 22:55.345
Oh yes, and I've been
meaning to answer it and…

22:55.407 --> 22:57.318
well I'll tell ya, I came up with something.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.855
We can use 2 choppers.

22:58.911 --> 23:01.414
No, no, no, darling, you're off concept.

23:02.581 --> 23:04.561
When Wiley jumps from the 1st copter,

23:04.617 --> 23:08.064
I want to have 2 others up
there for maximum film coverage.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.326
He's gonna jump?

23:09.388 --> 23:11.595
Wiley's our product spokesman.

23:11.657 --> 23:13.432
It's in his contract.

23:14.994 --> 23:17.440
We have a contract too, don't we, Dom?

23:18.631 --> 23:20.941
3, 3 helicopters.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.444
And I'll get you some local talent.

23:27.573 --> 23:30.213
I know he can be a little difficult, but

23:30.276 --> 23:31.721
such an artist.

23:31.777 --> 23:34.724
He's too good for commercials, he really is.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.486
Is she serious?

23:39.752 --> 23:41.060
Of course.

23:41.120 --> 23:44.363
And I am the next Olivier.

23:52.498 --> 23:53.602
Ta-ta.

23:58.037 --> 23:59.880
Mr. Santini.

24:00.072 --> 24:02.678
Oh yeah, I owe you for that clean’n.

24:02.741 --> 24:05.745
Is $10 all right?

24:05.811 --> 24:07.848
That's fine, Mr. Santini.

24:07.913 --> 24:10.393
Hey, you ever see one of these before?

24:10.983 --> 24:14.931
Yeah, but I guess String’d
know more about ‘em than I do.

24:14.987 --> 24:16.762
Come on Cate, let's clean up, huh?

24:16.822 --> 24:18.233
The Huey-1J.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.031
We used to see plenty of these over in Nam,

24:20.125 --> 24:21.968
but they're pretty rare in commercial use.

24:22.561 --> 24:25.041
There is one company that
uses it from time to time.

24:25.097 --> 24:27.668
Well, you know the name of that company?

24:28.133 --> 24:30.977
No, I can't say I do.

24:33.639 --> 24:35.983
You got a place to stay tonight?

24:36.675 --> 24:37.983
Yeah sure.

24:39.478 --> 24:42.357
Why don't you take that thing home with ya?

24:43.248 --> 24:45.751
Bring it back with you in the
morning when you come to work.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.126
In the morning?

24:47.586 --> 24:49.998
Yeah, things are gett’n
kinda hectic around here.

24:50.055 --> 24:52.126
We could use an extra hand.

24:58.564 --> 24:59.599
Good night, Kevin.

24:59.665 --> 25:00.905
Good night. See you all tomorrow.

25:00.966 --> 25:02.707
Good night.

25:09.308 --> 25:11.914
You know, I used to know a kid like him once.

25:14.913 --> 25:16.893
Yeah? Who?

25:18.150 --> 25:20.596
Stringfellow Hawke, who else?

26:04.229 --> 26:05.674
I'm finished.

26:06.899 --> 26:10.210
This was a rush job, you know,
but it's primo work.

26:10.469 --> 26:11.573
Great.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.550
Now, let's see it.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.724
You got an 8-round magazine,

26:24.783 --> 26:27.229
and there's a trigger on the stick.

26:28.854 --> 26:29.958
Okay?

26:30.289 --> 26:32.701
Oh yeah, it's good.

26:33.125 --> 26:36.698
And after our little encounter with
that police chopper the other day, I…

26:36.795 --> 26:38.934
I like the extra protection.

26:40.999 --> 26:42.410
Pay the man.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.481
Yes, sir.

26:48.140 --> 26:51.553
These are dangerous times we live in.

26:51.610 --> 26:55.786
My little conversion piece is
get’n to be a real popular item.

27:30.949 --> 27:32.929
I got you some coffee and rolls.

27:35.420 --> 27:36.592
You know,

27:36.855 --> 27:39.859
if we can get those commercial shots by dusk,

27:40.659 --> 27:43.401
we can sneak our lady in here tonight.

27:43.495 --> 27:44.701
No moon.

27:44.763 --> 27:47.039
All right. All right.

27:47.099 --> 27:49.807
Good morning, Mr. Santini, Mr. Hawke.

27:52.070 --> 27:53.447
Hey, Kevin.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.985
I got some rolls and coffee
over here if you want some.

27:56.041 --> 27:57.384
No thanks.

27:57.643 --> 27:59.748
I already had a big breakfast.

27:59.945 --> 28:01.253
Hey Dom,

28:01.313 --> 28:04.192
you're not gonna believe it. Not one
name on this list is available.

28:04.249 --> 28:08.356
I mean, every pilot from Cupertino to
Oxnard is either working or out of town.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.491
If I don't have a pilot by 1:00,

28:10.556 --> 28:14.470
that Bert guy is gonna be
all over me like a $3 suit.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.164
Say, Mr. Santini,

28:17.496 --> 28:18.941
I can fly.

28:18.997 --> 28:20.499
Yeah, you can fly.

28:21.266 --> 28:22.506
You can what?

28:22.568 --> 28:25.481
Fly, helicopters. I'm a licensed pilot.

28:31.743 --> 28:33.381
Okay, we got air speed,

28:33.478 --> 28:34.957
altimeter,

28:35.013 --> 28:36.993
fuel tanks 1 and 2,

28:37.082 --> 28:38.720
turn and bank

28:39.017 --> 28:41.361
and artificial horizon indicator.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.730
I know, you can go up and down.

28:56.268 --> 28:58.680
What are you try’n to prove, Kevin?

28:58.737 --> 29:01.616
Guess I did get a little
carried away, didn't I?

29:04.543 --> 29:06.614
Look, I know you can fly.

29:07.346 --> 29:10.816
I'm just try’n to figure out if you
can handle responsibility or not.

29:10.882 --> 29:12.862
I'll be careful, I swear. I won’t do anything.

29:12.918 --> 29:14.329
I won't budge even one little inch

29:14.386 --> 29:17.458
unless you or Mr. Santini
tells me to, I promise.

29:20.859 --> 29:22.497
All right, try it again.

29:22.561 --> 29:23.869
But Kevin,

29:24.930 --> 29:26.375
don't let me down.

29:26.431 --> 29:27.569
I won't.

29:42.047 --> 29:44.459
All right Wiley, you're a clown.

29:44.516 --> 29:47.360
Now, sell it to me. I want it all.

30:00.899 --> 30:03.709
Sorry, we're taking a
little detour, Mr. Beecham.

30:07.072 --> 30:09.484
Kevin, what's going on up there?

30:09.541 --> 30:13.079
You're supposed to wait for us to
get in position for the finale.

30:13.178 --> 30:14.623
Where's he going?

30:14.780 --> 30:17.852
Who, Kevin? That good old boy.

30:17.916 --> 30:22.160
Well, he's going up there to double
check his safety system, that's all.

30:22.220 --> 30:24.029
Isn't that right, String?

30:24.589 --> 30:26.432
You get him back here this instant,

30:26.491 --> 30:29.028
or you and your guys are off the job!

30:43.041 --> 30:45.385
Hey, check our 6:00.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.321
He's overtaking us.

30:50.949 --> 30:54.089
Considering our cargo,
I think I'll open her up.

31:09.234 --> 31:13.410
Hey, where in the script does
it say anything about this?

31:19.077 --> 31:21.921
My Agent is responsible for this!

31:50.075 --> 31:53.887
Thanks, kid. That was the most
real thing I've done in years.

32:05.323 --> 32:07.325
All right Kevin, what the
hell happened up there?

32:07.392 --> 32:09.303
You just cost us our jobs.

32:09.361 --> 32:12.240
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to lose the job for you.

32:12.297 --> 32:14.800
I'll pay you back, every penny.

32:18.904 --> 32:21.510
I don't know how, but I will,

32:21.573 --> 32:23.177
as soon as I…

32:23.775 --> 32:25.550
As soon as what?

32:27.312 --> 32:29.485
I wish I could tell you,

32:30.449 --> 32:31.860
but I can't.

32:32.451 --> 32:33.862
I just can't.

32:39.724 --> 32:41.726
Son, I want you to go home,

32:42.461 --> 32:44.600
and you think about this.

32:45.497 --> 32:47.534
You've got 3 friends here,

32:47.999 --> 32:49.910
and we talk to you straight,

32:50.035 --> 32:52.606
and we expect you to talk to us straight.

32:52.671 --> 32:53.775
Okay?

32:59.511 --> 33:02.253
That kid's been hurt real bad Hawke,

33:02.781 --> 33:04.124
somewhere,

33:04.883 --> 33:06.055
somehow.

33:11.656 --> 33:14.967
Now, stay as close to my bird as possible

33:15.026 --> 33:17.870
so we will show only one image
on that tower radar, will you?

33:17.929 --> 33:19.533
Dom, I'll be 2 inches off your tail.

33:19.598 --> 33:21.168
And watch my wake turbulence

33:21.233 --> 33:24.180
or we'll have more than a radar
overhaul, you understand?

33:24.236 --> 33:25.510
All right.

33:40.385 --> 33:42.956
Van Nuys tower, this is 44 Charlie.

33:43.021 --> 33:46.002
I'm 5 miles out. Request a lock-heat approach

33:46.057 --> 33:48.128
to Santini Air, over.

33:48.527 --> 33:51.235
44 Charlie, you are clear to land.

33:51.296 --> 33:53.799
The wind is from the northeast, 10 knots.

33:53.865 --> 33:56.038
Use runway 4, over and out.

34:06.077 --> 34:07.954
Checking out heat sources.

34:11.181 --> 34:13.628
There's not a soul in sight, Dominic.

34:54.359 --> 34:58.330
Lady is secure, Dom. I'm beat.

34:59.197 --> 35:02.201
How about we get something
to eat before we start work?

35:02.267 --> 35:04.907
Sure thing. See you out front.

35:46.344 --> 35:47.880
Oh, man.

35:52.851 --> 35:54.728
I don't believe it.

36:11.503 --> 36:12.777
Man.

36:40.665 --> 36:43.145
You know, Kevin, if you'd
told us a little sooner,

36:43.201 --> 36:45.203
it would've been a whole lot easier on you.

36:45.270 --> 36:47.375
I was afraid you'd call the police,

36:47.439 --> 36:49.680
and they'd try and stop me
from finding who did it.

36:49.741 --> 36:53.621
You know, you're gonna have to learn
that you can't do everything alone.

36:53.845 --> 36:56.086
That's just what my uncle said.

36:58.383 --> 37:01.023
Let's check it out. You got that book?

37:04.456 --> 37:06.436
This can't be that tough.

37:13.431 --> 37:15.536
Even we got a big brother.

37:19.137 --> 37:20.912
Good morning, Hawke.

37:21.039 --> 37:23.246
We've processed your request.

37:23.341 --> 37:26.879
Only 3 companies import that
particular model of helicopter.

37:26.945 --> 37:29.949
The only one servicing your area is

37:30.014 --> 37:32.460
Blue Stone Flight Service.

37:32.751 --> 37:36.699
It's an up-scale shuttle for
executives and movie people,

37:36.755 --> 37:40.100
the kind of company Santini
wishes he were running.

37:41.693 --> 37:43.070
Big deal.

37:43.328 --> 37:45.808
The FBI has had Blue Stone under surveillance

37:45.864 --> 37:47.810
for drug trafficking for sometime.

37:47.866 --> 37:50.142
They've been using a UH-1J.

37:50.201 --> 37:52.340
That's a rare one, gentlemen.

37:54.405 --> 37:58.148
Mind if I ask why you're
interested in Blue Stone?

37:58.209 --> 38:00.120
We're really not sure yet.

38:00.345 --> 38:02.484
But if anything else comes
across your computer,

38:02.547 --> 38:04.788
you give us a call, okay?

38:05.583 --> 38:07.460
Blue Stone Aviation?

38:07.519 --> 38:09.123
Well, that's just a couple
of miles down the road.

38:09.187 --> 38:11.064
I could go down there
right now and check it out.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.567
Now, wait a minute.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.126
As long as you're working on my time,

38:14.192 --> 38:17.901
I'm not gonna have you walking
around into I don't know what.

38:19.631 --> 38:23.374
Look, we'll finish the repairs, then
we'll all go down there together.

38:23.501 --> 38:24.536
Fine.

38:24.602 --> 38:26.513
I have an idea. Why don't
you finish the repairs,

38:26.571 --> 38:28.847
and I'll take those film
canisters back to the ad agency?

38:29.440 --> 38:30.783
Good idea.

38:31.709 --> 38:33.416
Kevin, why don't you go with her?

38:33.478 --> 38:36.948
And don't worry, we'll get
to the bottom of all this.

38:37.849 --> 38:39.123
Come on.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.394
You mean you were a real cop?

38:47.458 --> 38:51.031
Yeah, and a damn good one too,
even if they seem to forget it.

38:59.737 --> 39:01.739
Okay, you're my backup on this.

39:01.806 --> 39:04.480
If I'm not back in 10 minutes, you use this.

39:04.542 --> 39:05.782
Okay.

39:11.549 --> 39:13.688
We're very booked up for the next few months.

39:13.751 --> 39:17.096
Perhaps, if you could be more specific
about the kind of service you require.

39:17.155 --> 39:20.102
I'd like to take a party of 6
to Big Bear for the weekend,

39:20.158 --> 39:21.831
for a business meeting.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.770
Let me get my group-rate carrier chart.

39:23.828 --> 39:25.865
I'll have this figured for you in a flash.

41:14.238 --> 41:15.876
You're not the law.

41:16.007 --> 41:17.577
That's what you think.

41:17.642 --> 41:21.351
In about 3 minutes this place is
gonna be crawling with blue shirts.

41:22.847 --> 41:24.758
Somehow, I doubt that.

41:26.017 --> 41:29.624
Anyway, in 3 minutes, we won't be here.

41:30.188 --> 41:32.930
We gotta stop him. He's the
one who killed my uncle.

41:33.458 --> 41:35.233
- You killed him! I know you did!
- Kevin!

41:35.293 --> 41:37.569
You did! He tried to tell me!

41:39.330 --> 41:41.571
Put them both in the transport.

41:43.034 --> 41:45.344
But Jake, the delivery.

41:47.438 --> 41:51.545
Well, we'll just have to drop
them off along the way.

42:00.018 --> 42:02.931
Caitlin and Kevin never
showed up at that ad agency.

42:03.855 --> 42:05.095
Oh, no.

42:05.790 --> 42:08.134
You don't think they went over to Blue Stone?

42:08.893 --> 42:10.167
Let's get over there.

43:29.841 --> 43:32.947
Plenty aircraft down there, but no Huey-1J.

43:36.147 --> 43:39.492
Wait a minute, radar has
one listed 10 miles out.

43:39.550 --> 43:41.496
Okay, I see it. I'm on my way.

43:48.893 --> 43:51.703
Schecter, what's going on over there?

43:56.300 --> 43:57.745
Schecter!

43:57.802 --> 43:59.679
There's no response.

44:04.075 --> 44:05.918
Caitlin, help! Help!

44:05.977 --> 44:07.479
It's got to be the kid.

44:07.545 --> 44:09.320
He's got the controls.

44:11.482 --> 44:12.825
You see that?

44:12.884 --> 44:15.023
How's he flying? We tied his hands.

44:15.086 --> 44:16.588
What are we gonna do?

44:16.654 --> 44:19.726
We're gonna force him down.
That's what we're gonna do.

44:20.091 --> 44:22.970
All right, listen kid. I know you
can hear me over the speaker.

44:23.027 --> 44:26.236
Now I want you to put that
chopper down where I tell ya.

44:26.297 --> 44:27.935
You can go to hell.

44:28.132 --> 44:30.237
Well, here's a little warning, kid.

44:37.875 --> 44:39.752
One more time, kid.

44:39.810 --> 44:43.257
Put her down or I'll finish you now.

45:20.718 --> 45:23.790
He's using Kevin's chopper for
cover. I can't get at him.

45:23.854 --> 45:25.561
Well, you better do someth’n quick.

45:25.623 --> 45:28.001
Kevin's bird is losing power fast.

45:41.505 --> 45:44.315
Something's wrong, Cate. I can't keep altitude.

45:45.376 --> 45:48.789
Come on, you gotta help me. I can't
control it without 2 hands.

45:48.846 --> 45:49.881
Hurry!

45:49.947 --> 45:50.982
I'm trying, Kevin.

45:51.048 --> 45:53.358
Hurry, help me! I need you now!

46:25.950 --> 46:28.760
Well Reverend, that's quite a
hot-shot kid you're getting there.

46:28.819 --> 46:30.127
You think you can handle him?

46:30.187 --> 46:32.030
Oh, I think we'll make out just fine.

46:32.089 --> 46:34.865
They oughta give him a medal
for breaking up that drug ring.

46:34.925 --> 46:37.030
And you did a nice piece of fly’n, too.

46:37.094 --> 46:40.507
Only next time I'd like to see
you do it with your hands

46:40.564 --> 46:41.838
untied.

46:42.633 --> 46:44.306
Thanks, you guys.

46:44.902 --> 46:46.711
Thanks for everything.

46:56.113 --> 46:57.421
Hey, Kevin,

46:58.215 --> 47:01.059
your uncle would've been real proud of you.

47:08.392 --> 47:09.700
Bye-bye.

47:14.131 --> 47:15.872
Think we'll ever see him again?

47:15.933 --> 47:18.539
Come on, come on, come on.
We got work to do. Let's go.

47:18.602 --> 47:20.240
Who knows?

47:20.304 --> 47:21.942
In the next 100 years,
we might get another one

47:22.006 --> 47:24.680
of those toilet bowl detergent commercials.

47:25.305 --> 47:31.651
