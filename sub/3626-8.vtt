09:56.378 --> 09:57.727
Let me help you with that.

10:00.730 --> 10:01.905

were admirable

10:04.691 --> 10:07.389

and you ruined my pants.

10:09.565 --> 10:10.522
Goodnight, Blair.

10:19.270 --> 10:21.533
Hi. Um, I'm looking
for Dan Humphrey.

Uh, yeah, he's here
with Vanessa somewhere.

10:29.933 --> 10:30.891
Uh, wait.

10:32.544 --> 10:33.937
What do you think?

10:34.024 --> 10:35.286
If no one comes to the show

10:35.373 --> 10:36.897
you might be the only one
who ever reads it.

10:36.984 --> 10:40.596
Um, well, I don't know
much about art.

10:40.683 --> 10:42.859
But I do know a lot
about spelling, so..

Um..

10:45.427 --> 10:47.559
Oh, no.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.040
I think maybe you, you should
have had someone proofread it

10:50.127 --> 10:51.520
before you stuck it
to the wall.

10:51.607 --> 10:53.348
Are you kidding me?
Where did I mess up?

10:53.435 --> 10:55.089

a hundred times!

said your name.

11:00.094 --> 11:01.182

humiliating me.

11:01.269 --> 11:02.618
Mm, sorry about that.

11:02.705 --> 11:04.228
Good, so you'll stop
abusing me then?

11:04.315 --> 11:06.622
No, but I will
introduce myself.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.189
I am Serena.

11:09.233 --> 11:11.366
Uh, Aaron.

11:11.453 --> 11:14.412
Oh! Aaron. Then, then,
then you're the artist.

11:14.499 --> 11:16.414
Yeah.

11:16.501 --> 11:18.112
I have to meet Rufus
at the storage space.

11:18.199 --> 11:19.417
He is stressing.

11:19.504 --> 11:20.767
When his right eye
starts to twitch

11:20.854 --> 11:22.203
that's when you have
to break out the valium.

11:22.290 --> 11:24.335
Too late. He's been winking
non-stop since lunch.

11:24.422 --> 11:26.294
The caterer thought
he was hitting on him.

11:26.381 --> 11:27.904

Hey, could you, uh,
get that for me?

11:27.991 --> 11:30.167
It's, uh, Blair.

11:30.254 --> 11:31.255
Since when does she call you?

11:31.342 --> 11:33.127
Oh, uh..

11:33.214 --> 11:35.607
I'm, I'm helping
her with this thing.

11:35.695 --> 11:36.783
Um, I gotta take this.

11:36.870 --> 11:38.175
- Sorry.
- Right.

11:39.307 --> 11:40.438
[sighs]
Hello?

11:40.525 --> 11:41.962
I just wanted to thank you

11:42.049 --> 11:44.181
for encouraging me to throw
myself at Chuck.

11:44.268 --> 11:47.837
I can skip dinner now that
I'm so full on humiliation.

11:47.924 --> 11:49.970
Chuck was completely unmoved.

11:50.057 --> 11:50.971
Well, are you, are you sure
he wasn't

11:51.058 --> 11:52.276

11:52.363 --> 11:53.625

of that...literally.

to show him my necklace'

is Chuck's Kryptonite.

Oh, that's good to know.

and he-he left?

where you want him. Trust me.

what happens.

Where-where's the mike?

Oh, they're hidden. There's
a bunch all around the gallery.

have nice things to say

12:31.315 --> 12:34.231
about you and your show,
because you're gonna hear 'em.

to come and find out.

it might be awkward a little bit

the single greatest
moment of my life.

20:42.589 --> 20:44.678
But you broke up.

20:44.765 --> 20:47.550
Doesn't mean I wouldn't
do it all over again.

20:47.637 --> 20:51.424
If I say it, he wins,
and if he wins

20:51.511 --> 20:54.078
then I'll just be
another girl to him.

20:54.165 --> 20:55.906
You don't know
if that's true.

20:55.993 --> 20:57.647
You have to decide what's most
important to you.

20:57.734 --> 21:01.042
keeping your pride and getting
nothing or taking a risk

21:01.129 --> 21:03.262
and-and maybe, maybe,
having everything.

21:08.354 --> 21:10.660
Well, I almost lost a finger
in the process

21:10.747 --> 21:13.620
And I might be permanently
cross-eyed, but I did it.

21:13.707 --> 21:15.404
Thank you.

21:15.491 --> 21:18.581
You look like hell.
You should go home.

21:18.668 --> 21:22.106
Uh, the buyers are gonna
be here any minute.

21:22.193 --> 21:25.066
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm
gonna need every moment alone

21:25.153 --> 21:28.417
to figure out what the hell am I
gonna do? This dress is a mess!

21:28.504 --> 21:31.551
It's not my finest work,
but I wouldn't call it a mess.

21:31.638 --> 21:34.858
The seams aren't finished,
the zipper gapes

21:34.945 --> 21:38.340
and-and you finished
the hem on the machine.

21:38.427 --> 21:40.211
I told you that once
the machine ate my fabric

21:40.299 --> 21:41.256
I had to start all over.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.389
Stop lying to me.

21:43.476 --> 21:45.826
I know where you were
last night.

21:45.913 --> 21:48.394
Laurel caught the interns
looking at pictures

21:48.481 --> 21:51.092
of you and Agnes out
at some trashy bar.

21:53.442 --> 21:55.531
Look, I'm sorry.

21:55.618 --> 21:57.490
I thought I could still
get it done in time.

21:57.577 --> 22:00.797
You want to be a grown-up
and have a real job?

22:00.884 --> 22:03.626
You have to accept
real responsibility

22:03.713 --> 22:05.541
and the consequences
for your actions

22:05.628 --> 22:07.413
when you don't
come through.

22:07.500 --> 22:10.764
I should've known better than
to give so much responsibility

22:10.851 --> 22:11.939
to a child.

22:13.767 --> 22:16.030
A-a child?

22:16.117 --> 22:19.990
I'm sorry, but thischild
seems to be the only one

22:20.077 --> 22:21.296
that can design anything
that the buyers

22:21.383 --> 22:23.820
are remotely interested in.

22:23.907 --> 22:25.561
This is not about that dress.

22:25.648 --> 22:28.172
You are using that dress as
an excuse because you are scared

22:28.259 --> 22:30.000
that if I am in that meeting
and meet someone important

22:30.087 --> 22:32.655
that they will want to be
in business with me and not you.

22:32.742 --> 22:35.049
You are lucky I don't fire
you this minute.

22:35.136 --> 22:37.312
Oh, you are lucky
that I don't just quit

22:37.399 --> 22:39.009
because then what
would you do?

22:40.489 --> 22:41.969
Go on home.
I'll see you Monday.

22:44.275 --> 22:45.755
Can I at least have
my dress back?

22:45.842 --> 22:48.758
Sure. It's of no use
to me anyway. Here.

22:51.631 --> 22:54.503
[chuckles]
I don't mean this one.

22:58.333 --> 23:01.684
You touch this dress, you will
never set foot in here again.

23:13.827 --> 23:16.133
Sometimes the most important
thing to know

23:16.220 --> 23:17.657
is when to get out.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.878
And when to give in.

23:26.405 --> 23:27.623
[sighing]

23:29.277 --> 23:31.453
[cell phone ringing]

23:54.345 --> 23:56.609
So, I-I'd say
this was a success.

23:58.393 --> 24:00.482
'Yeah, yeah.'

24:00.569 --> 24:04.051
Makes me realize what a bust
all my other openings were.

24:04.138 --> 24:05.705
'Well, I'm gonna let you bask
in your glory'

24:05.792 --> 24:07.533
because Serena's here and..

24:09.448 --> 24:11.232
and she brought Blair,
again.

24:11.319 --> 24:13.190
That's the second time
that girl was here today.

24:14.757 --> 24:16.455
You're not..

24:16.542 --> 24:18.718
I'm not what? Oh, no. Oh, no,
no, no, no. No, no. I'm not, no.

24:18.805 --> 24:21.590
I mean, Serena wants us
to get along but not like that.

24:21.677 --> 24:23.897
No, that would, uh,
that would be sick.

24:23.984 --> 24:25.376
Oh, why don't you
just tell Serena

24:25.464 --> 24:27.204
you're not interested
in being friends with Blair?

24:27.291 --> 24:28.728
No, we just started
hanging out again.

24:28.815 --> 24:29.903
I don't wanna
rock the boat.

24:32.035 --> 24:34.690
Hey.

24:34.777 --> 24:37.301
This is a huge turnout.
Aaron must be so thrilled.

24:38.955 --> 24:40.000
And your dad.

24:40.087 --> 24:42.176
Yeah, yeah,
it's pretty exciting.

24:42.263 --> 24:44.352
Uh, so I thought you were
gonna be with Chuck tonight.

24:44.439 --> 24:46.006
What happened?

24:46.093 --> 24:47.311
Oh, she is, um, but she
told him to meet her here.

24:47.398 --> 24:48.965
She needed some
moral support.

24:49.052 --> 24:51.228
Yes.Sheis freaking out.
She needs a drink.

24:54.623 --> 24:56.495
Let me see what I can do
about that for her.

25:03.110 --> 25:04.851
So, first Nate's
a part of the family

25:04.938 --> 25:06.679
and then I see you've invited
Blair to my opening?

25:06.766 --> 25:08.028
- Seriously?
- I'm sorry.

25:08.115 --> 25:09.638
I-I know. I know.
I didn't invite her.

25:09.725 --> 25:11.814
But Serena and Blair tend
to be a package deal.

25:11.901 --> 25:13.642
And I don't know.

25:13.729 --> 25:17.472
I've-I've recently sort of seen
another side to her, and..

25:17.559 --> 25:19.082
I mean, she's not that bad.

25:19.169 --> 25:21.432
Are you kidding? You're talking
about Blair Waldorf.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.652
She and Chuck just used me
as catnip for one of their

25:23.739 --> 25:26.916
twisted little games, and what
they did was really messed up.

25:27.003 --> 25:28.788
I-I had no idea.
Why didn't you tell me that?

25:28.875 --> 25:32.052
Truthfully,
I was embarrassed.

25:32.139 --> 25:33.923
And the weird part
is that Chuck wound up

25:34.010 --> 25:35.490
being the more
human of the two.

25:35.577 --> 25:39.102
At least he felt a little
bad about it. Not her.

25:39.189 --> 25:40.843
What?

25:40.930 --> 25:42.541
No, it's just I can't believe
that I allowed myself

25:42.628 --> 25:44.238
to be sucked in
by Blair Waldorf.

25:52.028 --> 25:53.639
What do you think?

25:53.726 --> 25:57.207
Um, I think that you are
officially a successful artist.

25:57.294 --> 25:58.905
Well, thank you.

25:58.992 --> 26:00.515
You know what they say,
success is nothing without

26:00.602 --> 26:02.169
someone to share it with.

26:02.256 --> 26:04.388
They do say that.

26:04.475 --> 26:06.739
So, who are you planning
to share it with?

26:06.826 --> 26:08.784
Uh, my dad

26:08.871 --> 26:12.396
my nana, my dog Mookie,
named by nana.

26:12.483 --> 26:14.485
She's a huge Mets fan.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.487
And, uh, and you.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.620
Uh, uh, you.
I was hoping you.

26:20.230 --> 26:21.797
Maybe dinner?

26:21.884 --> 26:22.972
Um..

26:27.281 --> 26:31.633
Uh, sorry. I, um, I'm not
really dating right now.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.592
Uh, yes.

26:33.679 --> 26:37.204
The vague and unsatisfying, I'm
not dating right now, response.

26:37.291 --> 26:38.814
I know it well.

26:38.901 --> 26:41.164
Usually I'm giving it,
not getting it.

26:41.251 --> 26:42.296
Sorry.

26:42.383 --> 26:43.993
Yeah, I can tell

26:44.080 --> 26:46.866
which is why I'm gonna
give you a second chance.

26:46.953 --> 26:50.260
If you can tell me the fate
of Cecil The Caterpillar

26:50.347 --> 26:51.958
I will go out with you.

26:52.045 --> 26:55.875
Okay, I don't really date crazy
people who speak in riddles.

26:55.962 --> 26:57.485
Just think about it

26:57.572 --> 26:59.443
and when you figure
it out, I'm yours.

27:04.057 --> 27:05.841
Chuck just texted me.
He wants to meet me on the roof.

27:05.928 --> 27:07.321
The roof?

27:07.408 --> 27:08.757
Well, this way,
if he doesn't say it back

27:08.844 --> 27:10.716
then I can just jump.

27:10.803 --> 27:12.065
Then he'll be really sorry.

27:12.152 --> 27:13.980
Oh, no. Don't do it, B.

27:14.067 --> 27:15.808
You don't want your obit
to say you died in Brooklyn.

27:15.895 --> 27:17.374
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

27:21.857 --> 27:24.468
Hey. Stay there.

27:24.555 --> 27:25.774
Blair, I need to talk
to you.

27:25.861 --> 27:27.646
I can't. Chuck's waiting
for me.

27:27.733 --> 27:31.562
I know. It's about that. Just,
um, you know, be-be careful.

27:31.650 --> 27:35.044
W-why? You said to be
the opposite of careful.

27:35.131 --> 27:36.567
You told me to take a risk.

27:36.655 --> 27:39.048
Right, I know, I know,
but I...it-it was bad advice

27:39.135 --> 27:40.920
'cause when I said that
I was thinking of how things

27:41.007 --> 27:43.792
were for Serena and me, I mean,
we're talking about Chuck here.

27:43.879 --> 27:46.055
- It's not the same thing.
- Yes, it is.

27:46.142 --> 27:47.753
And it's gonna be okay.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.276
Sure, well, maybe.

27:49.363 --> 27:50.538
Just before you say anything

27:50.625 --> 27:53.672
make sure he's done
playing games.

27:53.759 --> 27:56.283
He is. Now, if
you'll excuse me..

28:00.374 --> 28:03.246
[indistinct chattering]

28:08.904 --> 28:10.253
Oh, hi.

28:10.340 --> 28:12.038
Hey. I didn't know
you guys were coming.

28:12.125 --> 28:14.083
Hey. I'm gonna go say
hey to Aaron, okay?

28:14.170 --> 28:16.869
Okay. Yeah, Max knows
Aaron from RISD.

28:16.956 --> 28:18.479
So, he wanted to come
and say hi.

28:18.566 --> 28:20.481
And I wanted to see you
after hearing about

28:20.568 --> 28:22.744
your crazy stunt
with Eleanor.

28:22.831 --> 28:24.877
Yeah, I'm actually
just about

28:24.964 --> 28:26.052
to go tell my dad
about that one.

28:26.139 --> 28:27.923
Before you do,
guess what?

28:28.010 --> 28:31.013
The editor from Nylon
saw the photos from last night.

28:31.100 --> 28:34.451
He wants to do a feature
on you as a designer to watch.

28:34.538 --> 28:36.845
Agnes, since
I quit Eleanor's

28:36.932 --> 28:39.892
I am an unemployed,
home-schooled 15-year-old.

28:39.979 --> 28:41.458
I'm not even
an intern to watch.

28:41.545 --> 28:44.853
Dude, relax. Max and I
were just talking about it.

28:44.940 --> 28:46.725
You should do
your own clothing line.

28:46.812 --> 28:50.293
Yeah, sure. With no money, no
contacts, nobody knows who I am.

28:50.380 --> 28:51.817
That sounds like
a fast track to success.

28:51.904 --> 28:53.906
Stop coming up
with reasons not to do it

28:53.993 --> 28:55.864
and just make
some more dresses.

28:55.951 --> 28:58.040
I can model them.
Max will do some photos.

28:58.127 --> 29:00.739
I mean, you can totally
do this.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.349
You really think so?

29:02.436 --> 29:04.786
Yes, now, you're gonna
come with me to this party

29:04.873 --> 29:05.831
and you're gonna
meet this editor

29:05.918 --> 29:08.181
'cause he's dying
to meet you.

29:08.268 --> 29:11.097
So, are you my bitch
or what?

29:11.184 --> 29:13.882
I am. I am totally
your bitch.

29:13.969 --> 29:14.970
Good.

29:17.407 --> 29:18.974
[male #1]
'Jenny, hey. Hey, wait up.'

29:19.061 --> 29:20.454
Hey, are you
taking off already?

29:20.541 --> 29:21.847
Uh, yeah. Me and my friends
are going to a party.

29:21.934 --> 29:23.457
Oh, I didn't know.

29:23.544 --> 29:24.763
I-I was hoping we could
hang out tonight, but..

29:24.850 --> 29:26.286
Well, there's always
tomorrow at the loft.

29:26.373 --> 29:27.983
Really? I mean,
I kind of doubt that.

29:28.070 --> 29:29.680
You're always working now,
like last night

29:29.768 --> 29:31.508
and the night before--

29:31.595 --> 29:33.380
Yeah, well, I actually
quit Eleanor's.

29:33.467 --> 29:35.599
Wait, you quit Eleanor's?

29:35.686 --> 29:37.950
That job was-was everything
to you.

29:38.037 --> 29:39.952
I know, um,
it might sound crazy

29:40.039 --> 29:42.781
but I'm actually thinking
of starting my own line.

29:42.868 --> 29:46.175
Really? What does your dad
think about that?

29:46.262 --> 29:49.744
Okay, um, I was hoping
for a more of like

29:49.831 --> 29:53.400
a congratulations, Jenny or at
least a monosyllabic wow, but..

29:53.487 --> 29:55.228
No, look. I mean,
come on, Jenny.

29:55.315 --> 29:57.273
You really think you can start
your own business right now?

29:57.360 --> 29:59.406
[Agnes]
'You coming, Jen?'

29:59.493 --> 30:01.582
Uh, yeah. Be right there.

30:01.669 --> 30:02.801
Hey, how old is that guy?

30:02.888 --> 30:04.759
Okay, that guy's name
is Max

30:04.846 --> 30:06.239
and he went to RISD With Aaron

30:06.326 --> 30:07.588
and he's an amazing
photographer.

30:07.675 --> 30:09.720
He's gonna shoot my line.
Look, I gotta go.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.331
Um, my friends
are waiting for me

30:11.418 --> 30:14.595
so I guess if my dad asks,
just tell him I'm at Eleanor's.

30:14.682 --> 30:16.423
Wait..

30:20.340 --> 30:21.863
Brooklyn?

30:21.950 --> 30:25.432
At least, it will
be memorable.

30:25.519 --> 30:27.608
I'm sorry, but don't you have
something you want to say to me?

30:27.695 --> 30:29.218
Yes.

30:35.964 --> 30:40.360
This is so silly. What does
it matter who says it first?

30:40.447 --> 30:41.578
Why don't we just
say it together?

30:41.665 --> 30:44.581
Because that
wasn't the deal.

30:44.668 --> 30:46.801
Why does everything
have to be a deal?

30:46.888 --> 30:48.672
Because we made it one.

30:52.633 --> 30:55.462
What's going on, Blair?

30:55.549 --> 30:58.595
You told me you had
something to say to me.

30:58.682 --> 30:59.901
Say it.

30:59.988 --> 31:01.903
Why do I have to be
the one to go first?

31:03.600 --> 31:06.429
I was the one who waited
on that helipad for you.

31:06.516 --> 31:08.867
- I went to Tuscany alone.
- It's ancient history.

31:08.954 --> 31:11.304
I was the one who
asked you to say it first.

been too scared to admit it.
