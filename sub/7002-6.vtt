WEBVTT

00:03.703 --> 00:05.870
It's time to float our brick.

00:05.871 --> 00:07.371
There we go.

00:07.372 --> 00:10.075
One more course,
and our brick wall
will be finished.

00:10.076 --> 00:13.144
Oh, golly, al.
I'm out of brick.

00:13.145 --> 00:16.280
Are you telling me, tim,
that you're a few bricks
shy of a load?

00:16.280 --> 00:17.849
<i>(snorts)</i>

00:19.952 --> 00:23.454
No, I'm telling you
you're one wisecrack
short of unemployment.

00:23.455 --> 00:25.223
<i>(snorts)</i>

00:25.224 --> 00:26.758
Now please go back
and get the rest of
the brick, all right?

00:26.759 --> 00:28.927
While al's back there,
we'll finish up the...

00:28.928 --> 00:31.630
Shh, shh, shh.

00:31.631 --> 00:34.699
Tim, there doesn't
seem to be any... Tim?

00:37.003 --> 00:39.004
Tim?

00:39.005 --> 00:41.673
Tim's not here anymore.

00:44.010 --> 00:47.746
<i>(screams)</i>

00:52.818 --> 00:56.287
Gotcha pretty good,
didn't I?

00:56.288 --> 00:58.123
Yes, tim, I'm quaking.

01:02.028 --> 01:04.562
That's a good mask.
Who are you supposed to be?

01:04.563 --> 01:07.431
I'm al.

01:07.432 --> 01:09.433
<i>(screams)</i>

01:09.434 --> 01:13.004
It's an al!

01:17.076 --> 01:20.912
It's Halloween, and we all
can't be as spooky as al here,

01:20.913 --> 01:23.948
But we can cut ourselves some
frightening jack-o'-lanterns.

01:23.949 --> 01:25.650
That's right, tim,

01:25.651 --> 01:28.586
And as you can see,
I have already carved
my jack-o'-lantern.

01:38.030 --> 01:41.432
Although, tim, I've noticed
you have not carved
your jack-o'-lantern.

01:41.433 --> 01:43.401
How perceptive of you, al.

01:43.402 --> 01:47.072
Well, I could spend long,
boring hours whittling away

01:47.073 --> 01:49.607
With an eensy-weensy
carving knife like you,

01:49.608 --> 01:51.976
Or I could put some excitement

01:51.977 --> 01:54.579
Into the pumpkin-carving process

01:54.580 --> 01:57.248
And sculpt <i>my</i> pumpkin
using what?

01:57.249 --> 01:59.450
<i>(all)</i> more power!

01:59.451 --> 02:01.586
You're darn right,
more power.

02:01.587 --> 02:03.521
I've cored and scored
this bad boy.

02:03.522 --> 02:05.223
All I need now
is a small explosion

02:05.224 --> 02:06.925
To pop the pieces
out of the pumpkin.

02:09.161 --> 02:11.162
I've filled the pumpkin
with natural gas,

02:11.163 --> 02:12.997
Installed
a small sparking device

02:12.998 --> 02:15.100
That's activated by
this simple remote control.

02:15.101 --> 02:17.102
Don't try this at home,
children.

02:17.103 --> 02:20.171
Tim, I believe that charge
might be a little too...
Too powerful for you, al?

02:20.172 --> 02:22.306
Too manly?
A little too macho?
No, all I'm...

02:22.307 --> 02:24.475
If that's the case, al,
why don't you just cower

02:24.476 --> 02:26.510
And hide behind
the desk here, huh?

02:26.511 --> 02:30.348
Because this bad boy
is about ready to go.

02:35.087 --> 02:36.755
See there, al?

02:36.756 --> 02:38.689
Nothing to worry about, buddy.

03:56.902 --> 03:59.838
Well, what do you think?
Could we put the kids
in the middle?

04:07.146 --> 04:09.480
Tim! How are you
doing down there?

04:09.481 --> 04:12.951
<i>(tim)</i> almost done.
Igor, let go of my leg!

04:15.620 --> 04:18.723
What are you guys doing?
I'm making the food
for brad's Halloween party.

04:18.724 --> 04:21.759
Perhaps you would like to try
some dirt and worms.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.694
<i>(gagging)</i>

04:26.899 --> 04:29.367
Mom, please tell me
I'm adopted.

04:29.368 --> 04:31.435
Mmmm!

04:31.436 --> 04:34.105
Delicious. <i>(slurps)</i>

04:34.106 --> 04:35.840
Oh, gross.
Mmm.

04:35.841 --> 04:37.808
<i>(man screams)</i>

04:41.546 --> 04:44.082
Well, honey, I don't think
we'll have to worry about

04:44.083 --> 04:46.450
The insurance salesman
for a while.

04:46.451 --> 04:48.519
<i>(laughs)</i>

04:48.520 --> 04:50.588
How's the haunted house?
Haunted house?

04:50.589 --> 04:52.991
Come on, I've designed
the catacombs of terror.

04:52.992 --> 04:55.960
Can we take a look?
It's pretty scary
and dangerous down there.

04:55.961 --> 04:58.029
Are either one of you pregnant
or wearing a pacemaker?

04:58.030 --> 05:00.899
No.
<i>(mocks randy)</i> no.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.700
<i>(laughs)</i>

05:02.701 --> 05:05.103
What have you been doing
down there all day long?

05:05.104 --> 05:06.604
What takes so long?

05:06.605 --> 05:08.907
Come on, honey.
Horror takes time.

05:08.908 --> 05:11.409
Besides, when brad's guests
get here tonight,

05:11.410 --> 05:14.412
They're gonna be down there
with their hair bleached white,

05:14.413 --> 05:16.414
Eyes bugging out
with that look of horror.

05:16.415 --> 05:19.117
<i>(groans)</i>

05:19.118 --> 05:21.419
That's the way you looked
on our wedding day.

05:24.523 --> 05:26.557
I shouldn't have
lifted the veil.

05:29.395 --> 05:31.595
Who told you to wear it?

05:31.596 --> 05:33.431
<i>(grunts)</i>
<i>(laughs)</i>

05:33.432 --> 05:36.434
Sit down. I want you
to finish this for me
so I can pick up my costume.

05:36.435 --> 05:38.436
This party starts
in an hour.

05:38.437 --> 05:41.105
I've been
running around like crazy
getting all this stuff done.

05:41.106 --> 05:43.207
I didn't have time to get it.
All right,
what do I do?

05:43.208 --> 05:46.577
Ok, I want you
to put these grapes
into this tapioca.

05:46.578 --> 05:48.646
What's that supposed to be?

05:48.647 --> 05:52.817
Eyeballs and pus. Mmm!

05:52.818 --> 05:56.087
Home cooking, huh?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:56.088 --> 05:58.423
If I put
green food coloring in here,

05:58.424 --> 06:00.158
It would look infected.

06:00.159 --> 06:02.660
Oh, that's good.
That's real good.

06:02.661 --> 06:04.028
Do that.

06:05.264 --> 06:07.765
Mom, everything fits
except for the pants.

06:07.766 --> 06:10.201
<i>(laughs)</i>

06:10.202 --> 06:12.470
Who are you?
No, what are you?

06:12.471 --> 06:13.804
Raggedy andy.

06:13.805 --> 06:15.974
Oh, that's right.
It's Halloween, I'm sorry.

06:15.975 --> 06:18.276
Look out, frankenstein.
Look out, werewolf.

06:18.277 --> 06:20.211
It's raggedy.

06:22.181 --> 06:25.749
No, just when you thought
it was safe to go back
to the toy box...

06:25.750 --> 06:27.618
It's andy!
Come on.

06:27.619 --> 06:31.389
Hey. Boo. Hey. Boo-hoo.

06:31.390 --> 06:32.723
Boo, dude. Boo.

06:32.724 --> 06:34.725
He and jennifer
are dressing alike.

06:34.726 --> 06:36.560
She's gonna go
as raggedy ann.

06:36.561 --> 06:38.896
Hold still, 'cause
I'm gonna be pinning you here.

06:38.897 --> 06:41.232
I feel like a sissy.
You are not a sissy.

06:41.233 --> 06:43.634
The two of you are gonna look
so cute together.

06:43.635 --> 06:45.636
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

06:45.637 --> 06:47.138
Brad, a lot of times

06:47.139 --> 06:49.140
Men do things
they don't want to do

06:49.141 --> 06:51.142
So the women
they're going out with

06:51.143 --> 06:53.677
Will do things
<i>they</i> don't want to do.

06:57.416 --> 06:59.750
Like what?

06:59.751 --> 07:01.452
Yeah, like what, tim?

07:04.923 --> 07:06.924
Get married,

07:06.925 --> 07:09.494
De-grease an engine,
shave your back hair.

07:11.230 --> 07:14.499
<i>(scary laughter)</i>
shut the door, please!

07:14.500 --> 07:17.201
Dad, I opened
the tool locker and saw...

07:17.202 --> 07:18.736
Shh, shh, shh! Quiet.

07:18.737 --> 07:21.372
Hey, why are you wearing
a mop on your head?

07:21.373 --> 07:23.508
Shut up, geek.

07:23.509 --> 07:25.243
I think your costume
looks great.

07:25.244 --> 07:27.978
Oh, if you like it,
I'm dead.

07:27.979 --> 07:30.614
Ok, boys. Let's go.
You go get your costumes on now.

07:30.615 --> 07:32.816
Put that down! Put it down!
Go, now, now, now!

07:34.953 --> 07:36.987
Raggedy andy.

07:36.988 --> 07:39.357
Brad's got it bad
for that girl jennifer.

07:39.358 --> 07:43.261
Aw, if I asked you to wear
that costume, you'd do it
for me, wouldn't you?

07:43.262 --> 07:46.097
I don't think so, jill.
<i>(laughs)</i>

07:46.098 --> 07:49.267
Besides, brad likes jennifer
a lot more than I like you.

07:49.268 --> 07:51.069
You wouldn't catch me
in any fairy tale outfit

07:51.070 --> 07:53.871
Because I've got the scariest
costume in the motor city.

07:53.872 --> 07:55.005
<i>(laughs)</i>

07:55.006 --> 07:56.907
Wrong-o, cherry buns.

07:56.908 --> 07:58.909
The rental house manager

07:58.910 --> 08:00.411
Has guaranteed me

08:00.412 --> 08:02.846
That I have
<i>the</i> scariest-looking costume

08:02.847 --> 08:04.915
That they have ever had.

08:04.916 --> 08:08.086
They've got a costume
that looks like you at 7 am?

08:09.688 --> 08:11.755
<i>(hisses)</i>

08:13.325 --> 08:16.026
Wilson, the catacomb of terror
is just about complete,

08:16.027 --> 08:17.428
But I need your chains.
Mm-hmm.

08:17.429 --> 08:19.863
Right inside
the garage there, neighbor.

08:19.864 --> 08:21.432
This is gonna be great.

08:21.433 --> 08:23.968
It's gonna be so scary
down there, those kids
are gonna love this.

08:23.969 --> 08:26.304
Well, I'm sure they will, tim.

08:26.305 --> 08:28.306
I believe it was
winston churchill who said,

08:28.307 --> 08:30.308
"there is nothing
so exhilarating

08:30.309 --> 08:32.309
As being shot at
and missed."

08:32.311 --> 08:35.413
It's a safe bet
it wasn't lincoln who said that.

08:35.414 --> 08:39.082
Well, everybody loves
a good scare, tim.

08:39.083 --> 08:40.585
Yeah? Why is that?

08:40.586 --> 08:42.753
Well, tim, it's just
a physical reaction.

08:42.754 --> 08:45.289
When a person
becomes frightened,

08:45.290 --> 08:49.093
His body releases
large amounts of epinephrine.

08:49.094 --> 08:51.795
I love that song, too.
Hmm?

08:51.796 --> 08:53.864
<i>♪ tall and tan</i>
<i>and young and lovely</i>

08:53.865 --> 08:55.933
<i>♪ the girl from epinephrine</i>
<i>goes walking... ♪</i>

08:55.934 --> 08:57.935
No, no, no, no, no.

08:57.936 --> 09:01.506
No, tim.
You're talking ipanema.
I'm talking epinephrine.

09:01.507 --> 09:03.407
Oh, yeah, sure you are.
Yeah, sure.

09:03.408 --> 09:05.476
Well, let's just say
adrenaline.

09:05.477 --> 09:10.748
It speeds up the conversion
of glycogen into glucose.

09:19.291 --> 09:21.526
And glucose supplies energy
to the muscles,

09:21.527 --> 09:23.594
Thus making them
more efficient

09:23.595 --> 09:25.696
For fight or flight.

09:25.697 --> 09:27.698
I don't care what it does.

09:27.699 --> 09:30.234
When brad's friends see
this catacomb of terror,

09:30.235 --> 09:33.271
They'll be epinephrine
in their pants.

09:33.272 --> 09:35.606
After 8:00, why don't you
slide around back

09:35.607 --> 09:37.608
And let yourself
in the basement?

09:37.609 --> 09:39.277
Oh, I'll be there, tim.

09:39.278 --> 09:41.379
Oh, I also need
that special meat cleaver.

09:41.380 --> 09:43.214
You know what
I'm talking about?

09:43.215 --> 09:45.183
Mm-hmm. Coming right up,
neighbor.

09:46.785 --> 09:49.453
Mark, hurry up!
Come on!

09:49.454 --> 09:52.022
Johnny's mom's gonna be here.

09:52.023 --> 09:54.358
Hey, randy?
What?

09:54.359 --> 09:56.827
Have you seen that meat cleaver
around anywhere?

10:00.031 --> 10:01.865
No, dad.

10:01.866 --> 10:05.969
Come on. Really.
I've got a splitting headache.

10:05.970 --> 10:11.242
Dad, don't you ever get tired
of that fake meat cleaver gag?

10:11.243 --> 10:13.411
I got a little surprise
for you, fella.

10:13.412 --> 10:15.279
It's a real meat cleaver.

10:15.280 --> 10:18.282
It's a fake head.

10:18.283 --> 10:21.018
Where's mom?
Uh, she's upstairs
getting dressed.

10:21.019 --> 10:25.155
Is it a real scary costume?
I don't know.
I haven't seen it.

10:25.156 --> 10:27.358
I'm ready.

10:30.529 --> 10:34.565
Who are you supposed to be?
I'm daddy.
Tim "the tool man" taylor.

10:34.566 --> 10:38.236
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

10:38.237 --> 10:41.004
Right. Yeah.

10:41.005 --> 10:44.375
You should have gone as al.
We could have gotten more stuff.

10:47.846 --> 10:50.748
<i>(horn honks)</i>
oh, that's johnny's mom.
Come on, we gotta go. Here.

10:50.749 --> 10:53.517
Let's take a look in there
real quick, though.

10:53.518 --> 10:56.120
What do you got in here,
no beard?

10:56.121 --> 10:57.855
Ok.

10:57.856 --> 11:01.158
We've got eggs,
soap, shaving cream.

11:01.159 --> 11:03.361
What are you gonna do -
hatch one of these?

11:03.362 --> 11:05.596
Get a chicken, shave it
and give it a bath?

11:05.597 --> 11:08.466
Johnny's mom asked us
to pick up a few things.

11:08.467 --> 11:11.402
She said she didn't have time
to go the store.

11:13.805 --> 11:15.706
Nice try.

11:15.707 --> 11:17.441
<i>(horn honks)</i>
<i>you guys get going.</i>
<i>Have some fun.</i>

11:17.442 --> 11:19.543
Remember, only go
to houses we know.

11:19.544 --> 11:22.946
<i>(tim and randy)</i>
don't eat anything until we
have a chance to check it out.

11:22.947 --> 11:25.616
Good deal. Watch both ways
when you cross the street.
Have some fun.

11:25.617 --> 11:28.218
Honey, would you
hurry on down here?

11:28.219 --> 11:30.954
The kids are almost here,
and I can't wait to see
your scary costume.

11:30.955 --> 11:33.524
<i>(jill)</i> I hope you're watching
those monkey skulls.

11:33.525 --> 11:36.260
They shouldn't
get too soft.
Shoot!

11:36.261 --> 11:38.929
Oh, no. I hope you
didn't ruin them.

11:38.930 --> 11:41.299
<i>(laughs)</i>

11:41.300 --> 11:43.133
No, they're all right.

11:43.134 --> 11:46.671
Monkeys are fine,
but that organ grinder's
a little crispy in there.

11:55.213 --> 11:58.716
Aah!

11:58.717 --> 12:00.718
Don't even start!

12:00.719 --> 12:02.953
That's the scariest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

12:05.256 --> 12:07.925
I had a little problem
with the reservation.

12:07.926 --> 12:10.127
Hide the dip!

12:14.966 --> 12:18.502
They lost my reservation.
This is all they had left.

12:18.503 --> 12:19.737
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>
wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Now.

12:19.738 --> 12:22.373
Hey, brad! Hustle up!
Your friends are here!

12:22.374 --> 12:24.942
<i>(brad)</i> I'll be right down!

12:24.943 --> 12:27.077
Trick or treat!

12:27.078 --> 12:29.980
<i>(scream)</i>
get in! Come on!

12:29.981 --> 12:32.249
You look so great!
These are great costumes.

12:32.250 --> 12:37.221
You got a devil,
and a ballerina and a bunny.

12:37.222 --> 12:38.989
Hey, I don't like the way
you're looking at miss carrot.

12:38.990 --> 12:41.826
Get over there.
Get out.

12:41.827 --> 12:43.193
Hi, mrs. Taylor.

12:43.194 --> 12:47.531
Curtis! Ho-ho-ho, tim,
curtis is here.

12:47.532 --> 12:51.001
Mrs. Taylor,
that's a great costume.
Thank you.

12:51.002 --> 12:53.604
You can't even see
how fat you are.

12:56.541 --> 12:59.543
What are you
supposed to be, curtis?
I'm an atom.

12:59.544 --> 13:02.780
Then why don't you split?

13:02.781 --> 13:05.048
Very funny, mrs. Taylor.

13:05.049 --> 13:08.218
Curtis, why don't you
help me put the hair
on the monkey skulls?

13:08.219 --> 13:11.722
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>
<i>(brad)</i> I'll get it!

13:17.562 --> 13:19.530
Hello, bradley.

13:23.468 --> 13:25.403
I thought you were coming
as raggedy ann.

13:25.404 --> 13:29.339
I changed my mind.
Why?

13:29.340 --> 13:32.810
You made it very clear
that you didn't want to be
at this party with me tonight.

13:32.811 --> 13:35.413
When?
You know when.

13:36.548 --> 13:39.417
Hey, taylor.

13:39.418 --> 13:40.818
What's going on here?

13:40.819 --> 13:42.953
Nothing. Jennifer
and I are together.

13:42.954 --> 13:44.955
She's supposed
to be with me.

13:44.956 --> 13:47.057
So get over it.

13:47.058 --> 13:50.193
Besides, you're having
a bad hair day, dude.

13:50.194 --> 13:53.431
Shut up, danny.
Hey, hey, hey!
Cut it out! Come on!

13:53.432 --> 13:56.233
We don't do this around here,
all right?
He started it.

13:56.234 --> 13:59.837
Did you start this?
Leave me alone.

13:59.838 --> 14:03.474
Come on! Brad,
come back here!

14:03.475 --> 14:06.911
Mrs. Taylor,
why did brad leave?

14:06.912 --> 14:08.546
Well, I don't know.

14:08.547 --> 14:11.148
I suppose
he's just embarrassed
about his costume.

14:11.149 --> 14:14.485
Oh. When are you gonna leave?

14:21.526 --> 14:22.860
Ok, girls, here you go.

14:22.861 --> 14:27.431
Dirt filled with worms. Ha-hah!

14:27.432 --> 14:30.835
Come on, buddy.
You gotta eat something.

14:30.836 --> 14:31.936
Ew!

14:33.338 --> 14:35.940
Hi, my name is curtis.

14:35.941 --> 14:38.576
You don't have
a very good costume.
Take a hike.

14:38.577 --> 14:41.111
Guess what I am.
An idiot?

14:42.614 --> 14:44.949
How's brad doing?
Oh, he's ok.

14:44.950 --> 14:46.584
He just wants to have
a few minutes by himself.

14:46.585 --> 14:48.452
You know, this zipper is,
like, sticking.

14:48.453 --> 14:52.155
I think I had too much punch.
Can you fix this for me?

14:52.156 --> 14:53.924
All right, too much punch.
How does this feel?

14:53.925 --> 14:57.394
Aah! Don't do that!
Come on!

14:57.395 --> 15:00.564
What are you looking for?
Vegetable peeler.

15:00.565 --> 15:02.900
Oh, come on, tim!

15:02.901 --> 15:04.869
This is getting, you know,
like, kinda serious.

15:04.870 --> 15:06.069
It is serious, huh?
Yes.

15:06.070 --> 15:07.938
Let me get the bolt cutter.
No, no, no, no!

15:07.939 --> 15:09.907
I put a huge deposit
on this thing.

15:09.908 --> 15:12.643
Just kidding.
A little spray lubricant.
You have to do this now.

15:12.644 --> 15:13.944
Sit still for a minute.
Now.

15:13.945 --> 15:16.046
Mr. Taylor?
Yeah, what is it, curtis?

15:16.047 --> 15:17.481
Where's the bathroom?

15:17.482 --> 15:19.249
Well, for atoms like you,

15:19.250 --> 15:22.019
It's down the hall,
near the cyclotron.

15:22.020 --> 15:23.654
You got it?
You're free.

15:23.655 --> 15:26.223
Ahh!

15:26.224 --> 15:28.158
Out of my way, atom boy!

15:39.571 --> 15:42.105
How's it going, sport?
Ok.

15:42.106 --> 15:44.942
Don't you wanna come inside
and join the rest of us?

15:44.943 --> 15:48.679
Yeah, I think I'll go in
and beat up danny.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.848
Aren't you mad
at the wrong person?

15:50.849 --> 15:53.116
I can't beat up jennifer.

15:53.117 --> 15:55.252
Oh, I don't know.
I think you could take her.

15:57.422 --> 15:59.122
Dad...

15:59.123 --> 16:01.058
What happened with you two?
What did you do?

16:01.059 --> 16:03.360
Nothing.
Come on.

16:03.361 --> 16:06.030
What was the last thing
that happened before
she got mad at you?

16:06.031 --> 16:08.899
I don't know.
Help me. Think.

16:08.900 --> 16:11.802
Was it tonight?
Yesterday? After school?

16:11.803 --> 16:15.839
Yesterday after school,
we played kickball.

16:15.840 --> 16:19.577
All right.
Got a clue now.

16:19.578 --> 16:23.280
You didn't kick her in the face
with the ball, did you?
No.

16:23.281 --> 16:25.883
Good. 'cause women
really hate that.

16:25.884 --> 16:27.685
What did you do?

16:27.686 --> 16:30.353
I didn't do anything.

16:30.354 --> 16:33.223
Besides, why does
it have to be my fault?

16:33.224 --> 16:35.793
Son, it's always our fault.

16:37.228 --> 16:40.197
Why didn't she just tell me?

16:40.198 --> 16:42.199
She said I should know.

16:42.200 --> 16:45.168
She didn't tell you
because...

16:45.169 --> 16:47.705
Women aren't as smart
as they think they are.

16:47.706 --> 16:50.240
They don't realize how little
we actually know.

16:52.410 --> 16:55.079
You gotta go in there
and find out what's going on.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.081
Try to see her side of it.

16:57.082 --> 16:58.983
I don't care about her side.

16:58.984 --> 17:03.553
Really? Why are you wearing
a red wig and size-18 shoe?

17:03.554 --> 17:05.521
Ok, I care.
Go in and talk to her.

17:05.522 --> 17:09.059
And remember,
the two most important things
you can tell a woman are,

17:09.060 --> 17:10.694
"I understand."

17:10.694 --> 17:12.796
I understand?
Right.

17:12.797 --> 17:15.397
Say those two words,
they'll forgive you
for just about anything.

17:15.398 --> 17:16.834
Got it.
Oh, one more thing.

17:16.835 --> 17:19.336
Lose the wig and shoes.

17:25.409 --> 17:28.846
How's brad?
He's ok.

17:28.847 --> 17:30.213
We had a little
man-to-man talk.

17:30.214 --> 17:33.017
I shared some of
my expertise on women.

17:33.018 --> 17:36.253
Oh. After that, you talked
about neurosurgery?

17:38.222 --> 17:40.724
No. We talked about how much
happier you would have been

17:40.725 --> 17:44.028
If you'd married
a big cabbage.

17:55.974 --> 17:59.176
Hi.
Hello.

17:59.177 --> 18:02.012
I thought you were
coming as raggedy ann.

18:02.013 --> 18:04.247
I was going to.

18:04.248 --> 18:06.650
I understand.

18:11.289 --> 18:12.890
Understand what?

18:19.764 --> 18:23.567
Um... I, uh...

18:23.568 --> 18:25.569
I understand
you're mad at me.

18:25.570 --> 18:29.006
Who wouldn't be? At kickball
you picked elaine instead of me.

18:29.007 --> 18:31.474
She's good.
I wanted to win.

18:33.011 --> 18:35.079
But you embarrassed me.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.647
You should have seen elaine.
She was gloating.

18:37.648 --> 18:40.217
Why didn't you
just say something
on the playground?

18:40.218 --> 18:43.286
Bradley, how could you not know?
You can be so dense.

18:43.287 --> 18:46.056
Hey, I may be dense,
but my team won.

18:46.057 --> 18:48.125
<i>(grunting)</i> don't start
talking like that, brad!

18:48.126 --> 18:49.392
<i>(coughs)</i>

18:55.100 --> 18:58.736
But I understand
winning doesn't matter.

18:58.737 --> 19:00.670
I should have picked you.

19:02.107 --> 19:05.142
I'm sorry I didn't come
as raggedy ann.

19:05.143 --> 19:07.277
Yeah. Not as sorry as I am.

19:11.983 --> 19:15.252
<i>(clanking chains/screams)</i>

Ok, everybody.
Come on down.

19:32.403 --> 19:35.305
Uh-oh,
the lights don't work.

19:35.306 --> 19:37.141
This is not good.

19:37.142 --> 19:40.844
Be very careful.

19:40.845 --> 19:43.213
Stay together.

19:43.214 --> 19:46.250
Watch out
for hideous monsters.

19:46.251 --> 19:49.319
There are no hideous
monsters down here.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.255
There's at least one,
curtis.

<i>(evil laughter)</i>

dumb little brother.

20:07.272 --> 20:10.240

Wait, wait! Watch out!
Watch out! That's chains!

apart anyway. Mm-hmm.

21:03.828 --> 21:05.295

Well, there's spiders

Al, those spiders are,
