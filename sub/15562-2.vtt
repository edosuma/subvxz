WEBVTT

00:03.602 --> 00:05.503
- Good morning.
- Morning.

00:05.505 --> 00:07.372
- Hm.
- Can't believe we're back.

00:07.374 --> 00:11.292
Same stupid timecards.
Same boring beige halls.

00:11.294 --> 00:13.745
Actually, I think that
cockroach in the light is new.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.563
Nope, Ernie's been here longer than me.

00:15.565 --> 00:19.083
I'm excited that things
are getting back to normal.

00:19.085 --> 00:21.870
No more corporate getting
all up in our business.

00:21.872 --> 00:24.989
Oh, you know that the district
manager's still here, right?

00:24.991 --> 00:28.193
Jeff? What is Jeff still doing he...

00:28.195 --> 00:30.821
You don't think he's trying
to find a reasonon to fire me?

00:30.842 --> 00:31.875
- Do you?
- No.

00:31.877 --> 00:33.343
Glenn, why would they fire you?

00:33.345 --> 00:34.527
They just hired you back.

00:34.529 --> 00:36.696
Because they're still mad
that I gave Cheyenne

00:36.698 --> 00:38.481
maternity leave.

00:38.483 --> 00:41.134
Maybe they think that people,
like, just walk all over me.

00:41.136 --> 00:43.637
Like I'm some sort of pathetic Peter.

00:43.639 --> 00:45.505
Oh, come on. They
don't... they don't think

00:45.507 --> 00:48.241
- you're... that.
- You don't know.

00:48.243 --> 00:51.027
I mean, these corporate guys,
they're out for blood.

00:51.029 --> 00:54.381
Okay? They are vicious, savage monsters.

00:54.383 --> 00:56.366
- Hey, everybody.
- Hi.

00:56.368 --> 00:59.619
Um, these are welcome back flowers.

00:59.621 --> 01:01.905
- Oh.
- They gave me a packet of, uh,

01:01.907 --> 01:04.274
plant food for it,
but I left it in the car.

01:04.275 --> 01:05.992
So if they die, I guess, just...

01:05.994 --> 01:08.461
throw them away. But, anyway...

01:08.463 --> 01:11.081
here.

01:11.083 --> 01:12.449
Cool.

01:12.451 --> 01:16.145
You guys have been through
a lot in the last two days.

01:16.145 --> 01:18.562
Your manager getting fired.
Everybody walking out.

01:18.564 --> 01:20.347
Not everybody walked out. I didn't.

01:20.349 --> 01:21.948
She did, he did, those three.

01:21.950 --> 01:24.134
- I've got a PDF file.
- Great. Good.

01:24.136 --> 01:25.452
- Thank you, as always, Dina.
- Welcome.

01:25.454 --> 01:27.270
But the point is, um,

01:27.272 --> 01:29.706
that I don't want to just go
back to the way things were.

01:29.708 --> 01:31.625
I wanna know what we as a company

01:31.627 --> 01:33.493
- can do better.
- Really?

01:33.495 --> 01:35.178
Great. Well, uh...

01:35.180 --> 01:36.413
I think we should start
with maternity leave.

01:36.415 --> 01:38.765
Listen up, ladies and jerks,

01:38.767 --> 01:43.086
because I am so not in the mood.

01:43.088 --> 01:45.205
- What is happening?
- No idea.

01:45.207 --> 01:47.324
Okay, I know corporate
suits probably think

01:47.326 --> 01:51.378
I'm a big, ole softy,
but as everyone here knows

01:51.380 --> 01:53.697
I'm a hard-ass boss.

01:53.699 --> 01:58.001
And I act like this every
day, not just today.

01:58.003 --> 01:59.669
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:59.671 --> 02:02.005
What we were talking about
when you came in was I wanna...

02:02.007 --> 02:04.591
Everybody here better do their job

02:04.593 --> 02:08.294
or you're all going down.

02:08.297 --> 02:09.529
- Ju...
- Oh!

02:10.765 --> 02:12.466
- Just step out.
- Just lift your leg up.

02:12.468 --> 02:13.784
- I can't find...
- You got it.

02:13.786 --> 02:14.851
- Just hold 'em up.
- Get it off me.

02:14.853 --> 02:15.802
- Okay.
- Yeah, all right.

02:15.804 --> 02:16.820
- Get it off me.
- All right, here.

02:16.822 --> 02:17.988
- Yeah, yeah.
- Just...

02:17.990 --> 02:19.422
We'll just... yeah, this is easier.

02:19.424 --> 02:20.457
Oh, boy.

02:26.719 --> 02:28.010
It's just so nice to hear

02:28.010 --> 02:30.143
that you actually wanna
listen to our concerns.

02:30.146 --> 02:31.562
Yeah, one big thing
we've been talking about

02:31.564 --> 02:33.547
is the store limiting
our hours to avoid...

02:33.549 --> 02:34.999
Sorry, here's what I'd like to do.

02:35.001 --> 02:36.517
I'd just like to take a walk around.

02:36.519 --> 02:38.452
Observe how things work.
We'll meet later

02:38.454 --> 02:40.721
and discuss ways that
we can all improve.

02:40.723 --> 02:42.657
Oh, sorry, did you just say,

02:42.659 --> 02:44.675
"we can all improve"?

02:44.677 --> 02:46.294
'Cause none of this happened because

02:46.296 --> 02:48.229
we weren't doing our jobs well.

02:48.231 --> 02:51.182
Sure, but... everything
is a two-way street.

02:51.184 --> 02:52.883
Yeah, but...

02:52.885 --> 02:55.519
some things are just... one-way streets.

02:55.521 --> 02:56.871
You need both, you know?

02:56.873 --> 03:00.224
One-way streets are useful
in terms of traffic flow

03:00.226 --> 03:03.878
whereas I lost track of
the point I was trying to make.

03:03.880 --> 03:05.413
Yeah, so here's what I'd like to do.

03:05.415 --> 03:07.064
I'd like to observe how things work

03:07.066 --> 03:08.733
when you guys are not in the parking lot

03:08.735 --> 03:11.452
screaming like lunatics
and then we can go from there.

03:11.454 --> 03:13.237
Think we can handle that?

03:13.239 --> 03:15.573
- I guess we'll see.
- All right.

03:17.160 --> 03:19.894
I'm sorry, we're the ones
who need to change?

03:19.896 --> 03:21.862
How about they stop limiting our hours

03:21.864 --> 03:24.749
or docking our pay for bathroom breaks?

03:24.751 --> 03:26.784
We are not the ones
who need to improve here.

03:28.721 --> 03:30.571
Yeah, we're pretty perfect.

03:30.981 --> 03:32.881
But, look, he wants
to hear our complaints.

03:32.883 --> 03:35.617
Yeah, and then not do
anything about them.

03:35.619 --> 03:37.119
No matter what we say,
he's just gonna be like,

03:37.121 --> 03:39.388
"Well,
it's a two-way street, so..."

03:39.390 --> 03:40.922
Wow, that was spot on.

03:40.924 --> 03:42.557
It was like Amy just disappeared.

03:42.559 --> 03:44.626
Look, guys, we just need to be on top

03:44.628 --> 03:46.862
of our game today, you know?

03:46.864 --> 03:49.765
Remember that day six months ago
where nothing went wrong?

03:49.767 --> 03:51.500
Let's do that today.

03:51.502 --> 03:53.552
March 14th cannot be manufactured.

03:53.554 --> 03:55.404
That's what makes March 14th beautiful.

03:55.406 --> 03:57.522
Okay, well,
let's just be on our game, okay?

03:57.524 --> 03:59.691
Okay, you got it.

04:00.045 --> 04:01.628
Attention Cloud 9 shoppers,

04:01.630 --> 04:04.464
beef products from Cloud
9 Ranch are now 80% off,

04:04.466 --> 04:07.173
but maybe ask yourself
why we would do that.

04:08.469 --> 04:09.935
You mean like that?

04:09.937 --> 04:12.938
I'm the kind of hard-ass boss
that corporate loves.

04:12.940 --> 04:14.940
- Uh-huh.
- I-I don't allow any

04:14.942 --> 04:17.860
jiggerypokery or argle-bargle.

04:17.862 --> 04:19.445
- Mm-hmm.
- Glenn...

04:19.447 --> 04:21.514
can I go to the doctor?
I've had a sharp pain

04:21.516 --> 04:22.932
in my lower right for days.

04:22.934 --> 04:25.768
There you go. Typical argle-bargle.

04:25.770 --> 04:27.853
- Denied.
- Actually...

04:27.855 --> 04:29.054
that sounds like appendicitis.

04:29.056 --> 04:30.239
I think you should go to the hospital.

04:30.241 --> 04:32.241
Thank you.

04:34.555 --> 04:37.949
I want to see that appendix
on my desk tomorrow, young lady!

04:39.000 --> 04:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:57.556 --> 04:59.373
Hey, can you tell me
where the bathroom is?

04:59.394 --> 05:02.228
It's kind of an emergency.
I exceeded your expectations?

05:02.231 --> 05:04.414
Thank you.

05:04.416 --> 05:05.749
Have a heavenly day.

05:05.751 --> 05:07.150
Hi!

05:07.152 --> 05:09.837
That guy just said
I exceeded his expectations.

05:09.839 --> 05:11.872
- Don't know if you heard.
- Nice work.

05:13.843 --> 05:16.326
- I'm Jeff, by the way.
- No, I know.

05:16.328 --> 05:18.428
Mateo. We met yesterday?

05:18.430 --> 05:20.280
I was the "loyal, hard-working employee

05:20.282 --> 05:22.466
with great skin"?

05:22.468 --> 05:24.401
Uh, so now that everything's
back to normal,

05:24.403 --> 05:26.537
I would love to talk to you
about my career here at Cloud 9.

05:26.539 --> 05:27.571
Yes, I'm so sorry to do this to you.

05:27.573 --> 05:29.806
I just have a bunch to cover today,

05:29.808 --> 05:31.575
but nice to meet you, Ma-tato.

05:33.946 --> 05:35.412
Ma-tato?

05:35.414 --> 05:36.864
Laney, make sure Tate's not trying

05:36.866 --> 05:38.565
to sell our customers time shares.

05:38.567 --> 05:40.901
Todd, keep Sal at least
100 feet away from women's wear.

05:40.903 --> 05:42.352
And women in general, if possible.

05:42.354 --> 05:44.254
Why is nobody working the deli?

05:44.256 --> 05:46.373
Oh, right, Dom told me that he just

05:46.375 --> 05:47.993
really didn't feel like coming in today

05:48.014 --> 05:49.864
and that I should cover
for him by telling you

05:49.866 --> 05:51.882
that... wait, go back.

05:51.884 --> 05:53.200
Let me take that again.

05:53.202 --> 05:55.836
Dom told me to tell you
that his pug, Elmo,

05:55.838 --> 05:57.438
fell into a sinkhole in the park.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.756
Just follow me.

05:58.758 --> 06:00.408
Okay, we need to keep the line moving.

06:00.410 --> 06:02.893
We have a lot of hungry,
angry people out there.

06:02.895 --> 06:04.695
Uh, you can just say "hangry" now.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.881
It's a new word.
My friend's cousin made it up.

06:08.267 --> 06:10.634
I'll take rolls,
veggies, and condiments.

06:10.636 --> 06:13.621
- You start slicing the meat.
- Slicing the meat.

06:13.623 --> 06:17.108
Oh, sweet, always wanted
to work this bad boy.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.777
Not totally sure how it works...

06:19.779 --> 06:22.330
Just, um, load the meat
and then slice the meat.

06:22.898 --> 06:25.131
Definitely. I'm a quick study, so...

06:25.133 --> 06:27.350
- Oh! I cut myself.
- Already?

06:27.352 --> 06:30.136
Well, maybe I should do...

06:30.137 --> 06:32.087
Marcus, that looks really bad.

06:32.089 --> 06:34.656
Just a nick. It looks worse than it is.

06:34.658 --> 06:35.841
Kinda stings a little.

06:38.228 --> 06:41.813
Marcus, is that your thumb?

06:43.951 --> 06:46.501
Uh... I don't know.

06:46.503 --> 06:48.937
You don't know?

06:48.939 --> 06:50.789
Why don't you check?

06:50.791 --> 06:52.391
- I don't wanna.
- Marcus, check!

06:52.393 --> 06:53.725
- I don't want to.
- To see if your thumb

06:53.727 --> 06:55.077
is on your hand.

07:05.439 --> 07:06.519
Ah.

07:06.540 --> 07:07.906
I need this thumb

07:07.908 --> 07:09.925
for work and driving. Door knobs!

07:09.927 --> 07:12.711
We just need to put it
in a cold, air-tight container,

07:12.713 --> 07:14.530
we'll get it to the hospital,
they're reattach it.

07:14.532 --> 07:16.715
- It's easy.
- Promise?

07:16.717 --> 07:18.550
Mm-hmm.

07:18.552 --> 07:19.785
Here. This should do it.

07:19.787 --> 07:21.737
Oh, come on, not the guac.
It's all slimy.

07:21.739 --> 07:24.073
You're not gonna feel it.

07:24.075 --> 07:25.924
"Yeah, I've got a whole PDF."

07:25.926 --> 07:27.359
Hey!

07:27.361 --> 07:29.445
Let's break up this loser squad
and get back to work.

07:29.447 --> 07:31.296
You guys don't hear anything, do you?

07:31.298 --> 07:32.948
Nope, I can't hear traitors.

07:33.279 --> 07:34.979
Oh, is that so, Peter?
Because I was just

07:34.981 --> 07:36.697
coming to tell you that
your wife has died.

07:36.700 --> 07:39.017
I just got the call.
I don't have a wife.

07:39.019 --> 07:40.302
Everyone knows I'm gay.

07:40.304 --> 07:41.720
Ha! I knew you could hear me.

07:41.722 --> 07:44.439
- In your gay face!
- Come on, guys.

07:46.293 --> 07:48.994
Hey.

07:48.996 --> 07:50.846
I've, uh...

07:50.848 --> 07:52.114
I've been there.

07:52.116 --> 07:54.759
Junior year of high school
I lost all the proofs

07:54.780 --> 07:56.663
for lit mag and we had to
stay up all night

07:56.684 --> 07:59.151
relaying it out. Everybody hated me.

07:59.153 --> 08:01.336
Especially Becca Fish...
such a Goody Two-shoes,

08:01.338 --> 08:04.590
but I killed them with
a little thing called kindness,

08:04.592 --> 08:06.959
and guess who became
the next editor-in-chief.

08:06.961 --> 08:08.861
Well, co-editor.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.380
Worst story I've ever heard.

08:11.382 --> 08:14.082
Look, all I'm saying is
with a little effort

08:14.084 --> 08:16.151
it's not that hard
to get people to like you.

08:16.153 --> 08:18.403
I really don't care
if people like me.

08:18.405 --> 08:20.205
Okay, but...

08:20.207 --> 08:22.441
don't you find it hard
being a boss to people...

08:22.443 --> 08:24.042
That resent you?

08:24.044 --> 08:25.811
Who's the one wearing the blue polo now?

08:29.206 --> 08:31.240
- You do raise a good point.
- Yeah.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.227
I watch a lot of "Dog Whisperer" DVDs

08:33.227 --> 08:34.811
and it's always easier to train a bitch

08:34.813 --> 08:38.515
- who enjoys your scent.
- That's exactly what I meant.

08:38.517 --> 08:40.767
Um... look, if you need any help...

08:40.769 --> 08:44.738
Pass. I can make people
like me on my own just fine.

08:44.740 --> 08:46.523
- Oh, hey...
- Yeah?

08:46.525 --> 08:48.441
- I just wanted to say...
- Mm-hmm.

08:48.443 --> 08:49.910
That story really is awful.

08:49.912 --> 08:52.112
I'd tighten it up. Add a couple jokes.

08:53.466 --> 08:54.949
Thank you for the feedback.

08:54.970 --> 08:56.453
This website says we have an hour

08:56.455 --> 08:58.155
to get you and the
thumb to the hospital.

08:58.158 --> 08:59.338
What happens after an hour?

08:59.438 --> 09:01.655
Um... nothing, it's just
a good number to shoot for.

09:01.657 --> 09:03.690
- Why are you limping?
- I stubbed my toe

09:03.692 --> 09:05.775
picking up the thumb. It really stings.

09:05.777 --> 09:09.162
Oh, damn it! Okay, act natural.

09:09.164 --> 09:11.998
Hey, there.
Everything okay with you guys?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.884
Yeah. Yeah.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.236
We were just organizing these batteries.

09:16.605 --> 09:19.089
I just have a couple questions
about shift assignments.

09:19.123 --> 09:22.140
Oh, uh, Glenn, I forgot to mention

09:22.160 --> 09:23.443
those skateboarders are back.

09:23.445 --> 09:24.844
Oh, Jeff, come with me.

09:24.844 --> 09:27.295
Now... now, those girls are big
for 12, but there's two of us,

09:27.297 --> 09:29.397
so it'll be a fair fight this time.

09:29.399 --> 09:30.631
Oh...

09:30.633 --> 09:31.816
Okay.

09:31.818 --> 09:34.418
Who broke into my locker?

09:35.040 --> 09:37.124
What is happening to this country?

09:37.145 --> 09:39.378
Mine looks burnt off.
It wasn't even locked.

09:39.478 --> 09:41.495
Everybody shut up.
I got you all presents.

09:41.496 --> 09:45.761
Oh, okay, guys, how nice of Dina to...

09:46.278 --> 09:49.036
break into our lockers
and give us presents.

09:49.037 --> 09:51.337
Yeah, prescription strength deodorant.

09:51.581 --> 09:54.141
- "Stop stink in its tracks."
- Now that's a gift

09:54.162 --> 09:56.295
- for all of us, my friend.
- Thoughtful.

09:56.298 --> 09:57.531
In its own way.

09:57.533 --> 09:59.816
- Men's razors?
- For your mustache.

10:00.036 --> 10:02.737
- You're welcome.
- "Gay Guy."

10:02.838 --> 10:04.347
Now, I had to order 30 of those,

10:04.347 --> 10:06.531
so if you have any gay guy
friends, just say the word.

10:06.533 --> 10:09.283
Um... okay, no big deal,

10:09.285 --> 10:10.801
but usually people say "Thank you"

10:10.803 --> 10:13.120
when they get presents. Come on.

10:13.122 --> 10:16.691
"It's Not All Interesting:
How to Tell a Better Story"?

10:16.693 --> 10:18.843
Now, I don't know if you
already have this.

10:18.845 --> 10:20.678
I'm assuming you don't.

10:20.680 --> 10:23.798
I'll be home in five, ten minutes max.

10:23.800 --> 10:27.084
Everyone's gonna wanna see
photos of the baby, so...

10:27.086 --> 10:29.570
oh, Amy... Hi, not now.

10:29.572 --> 10:32.974
Okay, quick drive to the hospital.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.767
They'll reattach the...
where's the thumb?

10:36.373 --> 10:38.719
- My thumb?
- Yes, Marcus, your thumb!

10:38.722 --> 10:41.022
There is no other thumb!

10:47.590 --> 10:50.173
Okay, listen closely.
When Jeff comes over,

10:50.175 --> 10:52.593
I'm gonna pretend to be mean to you,

10:52.595 --> 10:54.628
but it's all an act, okay?

10:54.630 --> 10:56.480
You're going too fast. I can't follow.

10:56.482 --> 10:58.932
It's simple. I'm gonna say mean things

10:58.934 --> 11:01.285
to you, but I don't
mean the things I say.

11:01.287 --> 11:03.086
So even though I really like you,

11:03.088 --> 11:05.022
I might say, "I hate you."

11:05.024 --> 11:07.491
- Hold up. You hate me?
- No, I love you.

11:07.493 --> 11:11.111
I... why is this so complicated?

11:11.113 --> 11:13.247
- Hey.
- Oh, ah, hey, Jeff.

11:13.249 --> 11:17.167
I was just telling this employee
how lazy I think he is.

11:17.169 --> 11:19.670
- You think I'm lazy?
- Yes...

11:19.672 --> 11:23.206
I'm sorry. I mean,
I-I try really, really hard.

11:23.637 --> 11:25.371
I always thought you liked me.

11:26.345 --> 11:28.979
I don't.

11:31.994 --> 11:34.228
He right. Actually, I am kinda lazy.

11:34.230 --> 11:37.614
Detergents. Pod, liquid, powder.

11:37.616 --> 11:40.200
Uh, high-efficiency,
et cetera, et cetera.

11:40.202 --> 11:41.401
- Whatever.
- Wow, thank you so much.

11:41.403 --> 11:43.170
You're a lifesaver.

11:43.172 --> 11:44.922
Oh, could you just
repeat that over here?

11:44.924 --> 11:46.039
Actually, I'm kinda in a hurry.

11:46.041 --> 11:47.541
So I... It'll only take a sec.

11:47.543 --> 11:49.660
This is my son. You're hurting my arm!

11:49.662 --> 11:50.794
I showed you where the detergent was!

11:51.914 --> 11:53.664
Now tell him what you just said to me.

11:53.666 --> 11:56.083
You're hurting my arm.

11:56.085 --> 11:59.186
I mean before that.
About being a lifesaver.

12:01.273 --> 12:03.006
It's okay, Owen. Mama's here.

12:03.008 --> 12:04.741
The bad man didn't get me.

12:05.734 --> 12:07.625
In the future, I'd love you to not

12:07.725 --> 12:10.293
grab our customers. Okay, Ma-tah-to?

12:10.295 --> 12:11.594
It's Ma-tato.

12:11.596 --> 12:13.679
I mean... Mateo.

12:15.650 --> 12:17.300
"Dear everyone,

12:17.302 --> 12:19.330
from the bottom of my heart I'm sorry

12:19.351 --> 12:20.450
that you are mad at me.

12:20.452 --> 12:21.885
I only acted the way the way I did

12:21.887 --> 12:24.187
because I'm a very loyal
person and I can't empathize

12:24.189 --> 12:26.428
with people who are
self-centered traitors.

12:26.449 --> 12:29.542
If I could go back in time
I would do the exact same thing.

12:29.545 --> 12:31.678
I consider this matter closed now."

12:31.680 --> 12:33.313
- Huh?
- Great.

12:33.315 --> 12:35.749
Great, uh... lotta great stuff in there.

12:35.751 --> 12:38.535
I just have a few notes. Tiny stuff.

12:38.537 --> 12:40.971
Maybe it could be
a little more personal.

12:40.973 --> 12:43.557
Sounds great. Write it up.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.276
There's just nothing like looking

12:46.278 --> 12:48.328
into your baby's eyes.

12:48.330 --> 12:49.896
Amy, wanna see my baby?

12:49.898 --> 12:51.298
Not now. I need everybody's help.

12:51.300 --> 12:53.433
Follow me, please.

12:53.837 --> 12:56.804
The last time we saw the thumb
it was in a tub of guacamole,

12:56.804 --> 12:59.421
but then we found this open tub
of guacamole on the floor,

12:59.422 --> 13:00.921
so it could be a different guacamole,

13:00.923 --> 13:02.406
or else it could be the same guacamole,

13:02.408 --> 13:03.691
but the thumb fell out.

13:03.693 --> 13:05.576
So the thumb could either
be in a guacamole

13:05.578 --> 13:07.411
or it could be anywhere. Any questions?

13:07.413 --> 13:09.497
Yeah, uh, is it just regular guacamole?

13:09.499 --> 13:11.649
No, it's, uh... grapefruit,
ginger, and lime.

13:11.651 --> 13:13.768
- Oh.
- Where's Marcus?

13:13.770 --> 13:15.870
Marcus is at the hospital.
Elias took him.

13:15.872 --> 13:17.521
We have 45 minutes to get him his thumb.

13:17.523 --> 13:19.273
Does the guacamole have nuts in it?

13:19.275 --> 13:20.508
What? Why does this matter?

13:20.510 --> 13:22.326
Well, I'm allergic.

13:22.820 --> 13:24.787
In the event of a tornado

13:24.808 --> 13:26.858
you wanna go straight for the eye of it.

13:26.860 --> 13:29.294
That is where it is safest.

13:29.296 --> 13:31.629
Oh, hi. We are just conducting

13:31.631 --> 13:33.681
a... a... an impromptu safety meeting.

13:33.683 --> 13:34.979
Well, I don't want to interrupt.

13:35.079 --> 13:36.528
I'm gonna need to see
all non-essential employees

13:36.531 --> 13:38.081
- in the break room.
- Right now?

13:38.083 --> 13:41.467
The man said now, so that means now!

13:44.972 --> 13:46.288
Okay, I'll see you there.

13:49.090 --> 13:51.040
Everything around here looks great.

13:51.042 --> 13:53.526
I mean, were there a few
expired shampoo bottles

13:53.528 --> 13:56.262
left on the shelf? Yes... six actually,

13:56.768 --> 13:59.189
but mostly good jobs.

13:59.267 --> 14:01.392
So now I would like you guys to tell me

14:01.407 --> 14:04.222
what we at corporate
can be doing better for you.

14:04.225 --> 14:06.592
You know, Jeff, it feels weird

14:06.594 --> 14:08.527
talking about this on company time.

14:08.529 --> 14:10.079
Oh, that's okay, it's an unpaid break.

14:10.081 --> 14:11.614
Yeah, of course it is.

14:11.616 --> 14:14.383
So maybe we'll just start
with the beginning of the day.

14:14.385 --> 14:16.435
Um, when we all clock in...

14:16.437 --> 14:17.686
You know what?
This sounds like it's gonna be

14:17.688 --> 14:20.990
a long Jonah story.
How about we put a pin in it

14:20.992 --> 14:24.059
and we get back out there
and we serve our customers.

14:24.479 --> 14:27.163
Really? I mean, now's your chance to say

14:27.184 --> 14:28.767
- anything you want to say to me.
- That's right, Jeff.

14:28.769 --> 14:30.703
Now is our chance, and we actually have

14:30.705 --> 14:32.404
a list of things that we think

14:32.406 --> 14:33.722
the company could do better.

14:33.724 --> 14:35.074
It's just I don't like complaining

14:35.076 --> 14:36.592
while we still have that outstanding

14:36.594 --> 14:38.327
shampoo problem to fix.

14:38.329 --> 14:39.762
You know, there are things that we could

14:39.764 --> 14:41.280
all do to improve.

14:41.282 --> 14:44.216
It's a... two-way street.

14:44.218 --> 14:47.236
- Okay. If that's how you feel.
- Uh-huh.

14:47.238 --> 14:49.138
Everybody, grab a cupcake!

14:49.140 --> 14:53.092
Oh! Nope, I hate cupcakes

14:53.094 --> 14:54.643
'cause I'm a meanie.

14:54.645 --> 14:56.228
Nobody move.

14:56.230 --> 14:57.897
- I have something to say.
- Ooh, I wanna hear this.

14:57.899 --> 14:59.315
- What?
- This is a letter

14:59.317 --> 15:02.501
to my subordinates
that I wrote by myself.

15:02.503 --> 15:05.654
Mahatma Gandhi once said,
"Forgiveness is an attribute

15:05.656 --> 15:08.540
of the strong"?
Ugh, starting with a quote.

15:08.542 --> 15:10.526
It's like a middle-school book report.

15:15.883 --> 15:17.866
Oh, uh, excuse me.

15:25.289 --> 15:27.856
- Oh, I'm actually not...
- Thank you so much.

15:27.858 --> 15:31.276
I'm in a rush.
I gotta get home to my kid.

15:31.278 --> 15:32.678
Sure.

15:34.582 --> 15:36.398
Oh.

15:38.436 --> 15:41.837
"So as I seek atonement
for my foibles..."

15:41.839 --> 15:43.689
that's a little bit much.

15:43.691 --> 15:47.142
Um, blah, blah, "The movie 'Magnolia"?

15:47.144 --> 15:49.962
- I'm gonna skip that.
- No, no, that's the best part!

15:49.964 --> 15:52.114
I would imagine.
It's... it's an excellent film.

15:52.116 --> 15:53.599
Okay, Dina, we get it.

15:53.601 --> 15:56.218
You messed up, you're sorry,
you'll never do it again.

15:56.220 --> 15:58.546
Actually, no. I'm not sorry.

15:58.593 --> 16:01.393
And this isn't even like
a "sorry, not sorry" situation.

16:01.414 --> 16:03.431
This is "not sorry, not sorry."

16:03.433 --> 16:05.850
You're all garbage, so grab a cupcake,

16:05.852 --> 16:08.453
and continue your slow march to death.

16:10.273 --> 16:12.757
- "Foibles."
- Great.

16:16.546 --> 16:18.129
That was brave, huh, guys?

16:21.685 --> 16:23.718
Hey, so I'm not sure
calling people "garbage"

16:23.720 --> 16:25.320
reads as an apology.

16:25.322 --> 16:27.221
Great leaders don't
care about being liked.

16:27.223 --> 16:28.873
Do you think dogs like Cesar Millan?

16:28.875 --> 16:30.525
Heck no, they just want
him to stop going,

16:30.527 --> 16:31.693
"Chh! Chh! Chh!"

16:31.695 --> 16:33.227
Why don't you care if people like you?

16:33.229 --> 16:34.912
Why do you care if people like you?

16:34.914 --> 16:36.864
- Because it's important.
- To you.

16:36.866 --> 16:38.149
Don't try to flip this, okay?

16:38.151 --> 16:40.268
- It's a basic human need.
- Of yours.

16:40.270 --> 16:42.036
You know what? I don't care how you feel

16:42.038 --> 16:43.688
about my need to be liked, and I realize

16:43.690 --> 16:45.089
that's kind of a contradiction,

16:45.091 --> 16:46.644
- but one day...
- Chh!

16:46.664 --> 16:47.212
Calm down!

16:47.233 --> 16:49.049
- Chh! Chh!
- Stop doing that.

16:49.051 --> 16:52.469
Chh! There it is.

16:59.862 --> 17:02.196
Whoever finds the thumb,
pick up the intercom

17:02.198 --> 17:04.932
and say...
I don't know, "strawberry jam."

17:04.934 --> 17:06.884
Ooh, but what if something
actually happens

17:06.886 --> 17:07.885
with strawberry jam?

17:07.887 --> 17:10.037
I am willing to take that chance.

17:10.039 --> 17:11.872
Do you think I'm a memorable person?

17:11.874 --> 17:13.339
Can you please stop asking questions

17:13.342 --> 17:14.730
and just go find the thumb?

17:14.829 --> 17:15.846
Please? Go.

17:23.888 --> 17:25.672
Ohh, beige.

17:25.674 --> 17:27.891
That's a crazy color for a towel.

17:27.893 --> 17:29.293
Nice.

17:29.295 --> 17:32.229
And you got one of this.

17:32.231 --> 17:34.598
Hmm. Oh, lady, hey!

17:34.600 --> 17:36.016
Let me dig in your basket.

17:48.114 --> 17:50.619
You guys, we are so out of time.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.834
Hey, guys, what's going on over here?

17:52.934 --> 17:54.833
Looks intense.

17:54.835 --> 17:56.151
Answer him!

17:56.153 --> 17:57.887
We were just talking about sales.

17:57.889 --> 18:01.473
Yeah, sales orders and utility patents

18:01.475 --> 18:03.359
and other words from "Shark Tank."

18:03.361 --> 18:04.460
- Okay.
- Good.

18:04.462 --> 18:05.694
Excuse me, are you the store manager?

18:05.696 --> 18:07.787
Heck yeah, I am, guy.

18:07.913 --> 18:09.579
I found a thumb in my guacamole.

18:12.417 --> 18:14.651
Strawberry jam. Strawberry jam.

18:15.675 --> 18:18.393
♪ The horn on the bus
goes beep, beep, beep ♪

18:18.395 --> 18:21.196
♪ Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep ♪

18:21.198 --> 18:23.281
Get off the phone! You're at work!

18:25.119 --> 18:26.818
I'm sorry.

18:31.792 --> 18:34.227
Thank you for shopping at Cloud 9...

18:34.962 --> 18:37.462
Oh, I put my phone in his bag.

18:37.464 --> 18:39.715
I'm weird for wanting to be liked.

18:39.717 --> 18:42.722
I mean, this isn't even about my ego.

18:42.754 --> 18:44.804
People getting along is the bedrock

18:44.806 --> 18:47.423
of a functioning society. Am I right?

18:50.595 --> 18:51.594
I've seen this one.

18:51.596 --> 18:52.979
They get in a big fight over a sofa,

18:52.981 --> 18:54.330
but it's not really about the sofa.

18:54.332 --> 18:55.314
I wanna keep it.

19:00.438 --> 19:03.940
Marcus got his thumb back,
so, you know, no harm no foul.

19:03.942 --> 19:06.192
I just really thought
that we could have a day

19:06.194 --> 19:07.443
where nothing went wrong.

19:07.445 --> 19:10.163
You mean like March 14th?

19:10.165 --> 19:13.366
We're never gonna have
another March 14th.

19:13.368 --> 19:16.252
Just be grateful you
were alive to see one.

19:16.254 --> 19:18.238
Do you think they're gonna fire me?

19:18.676 --> 19:21.424
I mean, I am the idiot who put
Marcus on the meat slicer.

19:21.426 --> 19:24.877
If they do, this whole store
will walk out in support of you.

19:24.879 --> 19:26.129
Thanks, Glenn, but I don't think

19:26.131 --> 19:28.965
we can pull that move twice in 48 hours.

19:31.136 --> 19:33.686
Hey, Jeff, have you told
corporate about the thumb yet?

19:33.688 --> 19:36.522
I'm just about to submit
an incident report now.

19:36.524 --> 19:38.274
Don't worry about it, I know
you had nothing to do with it.

19:38.276 --> 19:40.643
Cool. Cool.
Yeah, I was just making sure.

19:40.645 --> 19:43.529
But out of curiosity,
what's gonna happen to Amy?

19:43.531 --> 19:46.649
Suspension, termination.
We'll have to see.

19:46.651 --> 19:48.317
Well, I'll walk with you to the office.

19:48.319 --> 19:50.503
I actually have something
I'd like to submit as well.

19:50.986 --> 19:52.284
I mean, obviously
corporate needs to know

19:52.284 --> 19:53.934
that a district manager was on site

19:53.935 --> 19:56.652
when an untrained
employee maimed himself.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.154
Uh, I'm sorry?

19:58.156 --> 19:59.589
God, I really hope this doesn't hurt

19:59.591 --> 20:01.407
your shot at that senior VP slot

20:01.409 --> 20:03.643
when Todd Spurman retires in June.

20:06.364 --> 20:08.531
And if I didn't turn the report in?

20:08.533 --> 20:09.916
Well, if you didn't turn the report in,

20:09.918 --> 20:11.367
then officially nothing happened,

20:11.369 --> 20:15.004
so I guess that means
I would have nothing to report.

20:17.342 --> 20:19.375
Fine.

20:22.964 --> 20:26.065
- I really don't like you.
- I really don't care.

20:37.812 --> 20:39.779
Oh, hey. Hey.

20:39.781 --> 20:42.065
What? What can I do for you...

20:42.067 --> 20:43.399
- um...
- Mateo?

20:43.401 --> 20:45.401
My name's Mateo.

20:45.403 --> 20:46.953
You know, I've been busting
my butt trying to show you

20:46.955 --> 20:48.621
I'm a good worker,
but you have your head

20:48.623 --> 20:50.873
so far up your own butt
you haven't noticed.

20:52.210 --> 20:53.509
I am so sorry.

20:53.511 --> 20:54.794
I have no idea what came over me.

20:54.796 --> 20:56.212
- It's okay.
- I shouldn't be talking to you.

20:56.214 --> 20:57.513
Stop, stop, stop. Mateo, it's okay.

20:57.515 --> 20:58.765
I'm sorry. It's been a long week.

20:58.767 --> 21:01.300
- I've noticed you.
- Okay.

21:01.302 --> 21:04.337
Thank you. That's all I was asking.

21:05.390 --> 21:06.889
I've definitely noticed you.

21:13.281 --> 21:15.364
Holy.
