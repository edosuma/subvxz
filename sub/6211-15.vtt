WEBVTT

00:01.334 --> 00:02.734
I can't figure out
an original gift to get Harvey

00:02.802 --> 00:04.235
for Valentine's Day--

00:04.303 --> 00:06.938
cologne he'll never use,
a red sweater he'll never wear,

00:07.006 --> 00:10.241
a teddy bear holding a sign
that says, "I 'heart' you."

00:10.309 --> 00:11.276
It's not easy coming up

00:11.343 --> 00:13.344
with something masculine,
romantic and red.

00:13.412 --> 00:14.712
Unless it's salmon.

00:14.780 --> 00:18.383
Nothing says love like things
that swim upstream.

00:18.451 --> 00:19.718
(gasps)

00:19.785 --> 00:20.985
Oh!

00:21.053 --> 00:22.053
I can't believe

00:22.121 --> 00:23.487
this finally came.

00:23.555 --> 00:26.324
Oh, Sabrina, here is
the perfect gift for Harvey--

00:26.392 --> 00:27.592
a certificate

00:27.660 --> 00:30.261
for a special gondola ride
through the Milky Way.

00:30.329 --> 00:31.563
I wonder which would be harder
to explain--

00:31.631 --> 00:33.565
the flying gondola
or the fact that I actually know

00:33.633 --> 00:35.767
a good burger joint
on that side of the galaxy.

00:35.835 --> 00:37.736
Oh, don't worry, a mortal
won't remember the ride

00:37.804 --> 00:41.540
but will be filled with
a special feeling of love.

00:41.607 --> 00:45.343
Like he's just sated himself
on 40 pounds of coho.

00:45.411 --> 00:47.145
I remember when you sent away
for this.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.180
You were completely gaga
over some mortal.

00:49.248 --> 00:51.850
Mmm. Ulysses S. Grant.

00:51.917 --> 00:53.751
Oh, that's right.
Good ol' Ulie.

00:53.819 --> 00:55.353
What ever happened to him?

00:55.421 --> 00:56.855
He got old and died.

00:56.922 --> 00:58.623
I can't believe
you waited

00:58.691 --> 00:59.624
a hundred years for this.

00:59.692 --> 01:00.892
Nothing's worth waiting...

01:00.960 --> 01:03.027
Hey! It's got a coupon
for free chocolates.

01:07.633 --> 01:09.367
Well, I know
what I'm having for dinner.

01:09.434 --> 01:12.804
But I don't think I'll redeem
that free anvil coupon.

01:12.872 --> 01:15.640

01:49.708 --> 01:52.210
Harvey is going to love
this magic gondola ride.

01:52.278 --> 01:54.379
I just hope he didn't get me
the same thing.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.214
(bird chirping)

01:56.282 --> 02:00.085
Ah, the first robin of spring.

02:00.152 --> 02:01.119
That's him.

02:01.186 --> 02:02.587
Devil bird.

02:02.654 --> 02:04.121
That miserable little magpie

02:04.189 --> 02:05.223
has been keeping me up

02:05.290 --> 02:07.525
all night
with his incessant chirping.

02:07.592 --> 02:08.759
He must be stopped.

02:08.828 --> 02:10.061
Oh, if only we
had a house cat

02:10.095 --> 02:11.762
to rid us of this
terrible blight.

02:11.830 --> 02:12.998
You're right.

02:13.065 --> 02:15.900
What kind of feline am I?

02:15.968 --> 02:18.102
(as Schwarzenegger):
Bird, prepare to be Salem-ated.

02:18.170 --> 02:20.071
Sabrina, what if he
actually catches

02:20.139 --> 02:21.840
that poor defenseless bird?

02:21.907 --> 02:22.840
SALEM:
Little help?

02:22.908 --> 02:23.942
Oh, boy.

02:24.009 --> 02:25.076
Never mind.

02:26.611 --> 02:28.646
(groaning)

02:28.713 --> 02:30.181
Whoo.

02:30.249 --> 02:33.251
I think we should downplay
Valentine's Day around Hilda.

02:33.318 --> 02:34.519
I just felt so sorry

02:34.586 --> 02:35.887
for her this morning.

02:35.955 --> 02:38.422
I mean, you have Harvey,
and I have Willard.

02:38.490 --> 02:41.359
Well, if it's any consolation,
I think she feels worse for you.

02:41.426 --> 02:42.527
She's been so depressed

02:42.528 --> 02:45.096
ever since she had to send
Daniel Boone back.

02:45.164 --> 02:48.199
Now she just spends her days
moping around the attic.

02:48.267 --> 02:51.469
So you really never had an
Indian friend named Mingo?

02:51.536 --> 02:53.471
No, ma'am, there isn't much
companionship in the wild.

02:53.539 --> 02:57.508
Believe me, when a tree falls
in the forest, I hear it.

02:57.576 --> 03:00.111
Well, you can stay here
as long as you like--

03:00.179 --> 03:01.980
I mean, until we get
bored of each other

03:02.047 --> 03:04.015
or my sister finds out.

03:04.083 --> 03:05.082
Look at this.

03:05.150 --> 03:07.819
It's just addressed
"To My Valentine."

03:07.886 --> 03:09.487
And it's not signed.

03:09.555 --> 03:11.690
"Dear Valentine, I wish
I could express in words

03:11.757 --> 03:13.692
how truly special
you are to me."

03:13.759 --> 03:16.160
Harvey can be so sweet.

03:16.228 --> 03:17.895
Sabrina,
clearly this was written

03:17.963 --> 03:21.432
by a worldly, sophisticated,
mature man.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.234
My monkey.

03:23.302 --> 03:25.870
Come on, this has lovesick
adolescent written all over it.

03:25.938 --> 03:27.171
(knocks on door)

03:27.239 --> 03:29.507
Hey, good morning. Thought
I could walk you to work.

03:29.574 --> 03:30.909
Thank you for
my valentine.

03:30.976 --> 03:32.009
Valentine?

03:32.077 --> 03:33.811
I didn't send you
a valentine.

03:33.846 --> 03:36.848
But I did get you, uh...
this stick of gum.

03:36.915 --> 03:39.484
It's sugarless,
and, uh, this watch.

03:39.551 --> 03:41.719
Okay, before I have to thank
you for your high-tops,

03:41.787 --> 03:43.220
Valentine's Day
isn't until Monday.

03:43.288 --> 03:44.656
I knew that.

03:44.723 --> 03:46.257
Uh, I can't walk you to work

03:46.324 --> 03:47.992
'cause I have
to go to the mall

03:48.060 --> 03:51.629
and... get them to gift wrap
the stuff I already got you.

03:51.697 --> 03:53.531
Oh, monkey, I'm so
sorry you're sick.

03:53.599 --> 03:55.500
Drink fluids.

03:55.567 --> 03:57.368
I love you.

03:57.436 --> 04:01.539
He's got a cold, and he's got
no idea it's Valentine's Day.

04:01.606 --> 04:02.741
Well, if Harvey
didn't send it

04:02.808 --> 04:04.108
and Mr. Kraft
didn't send it,

04:04.176 --> 04:06.911
then... it must have
been sent for Aunt Hilda.

04:06.979 --> 04:08.146
Sabrina, you're right.

04:08.213 --> 04:10.347
And it couldn't have come
at a better time.

04:10.415 --> 04:11.849
(whistling)
Do we still have

04:11.917 --> 04:13.518
any of that venison left?

04:13.586 --> 04:16.487
It's a wonder she can
get up in the morning.

04:16.555 --> 04:18.822
Aunt Hilda, look what came
for you in the mail--

04:18.891 --> 04:21.024
an anonymous valentine
from some secret admirer.

04:21.093 --> 04:22.494
Couldn't be for me.

04:22.561 --> 04:24.162
I'll be up in the attic

04:24.229 --> 04:26.965
making sure our wiring
is up to code.

04:26.965 --> 04:30.534
She's breaking my heart.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.503
Relax, I don't want
your powder pouch

04:32.571 --> 04:33.938
or your "chaw of tobacky."

04:34.006 --> 04:35.907
Valentine's Day
isn't until Monday.

04:35.974 --> 04:38.642
Good, 'cause I'm fixin'
to make you a nice fur cap.

04:38.710 --> 04:40.879
If I could just trap
that pesky black varmint

04:40.946 --> 04:42.447
I see scurrying around here.

04:42.514 --> 04:43.814
That's our family pet.

04:43.882 --> 04:45.783
So if you're thinking
of trapping him...

04:45.851 --> 04:48.219
he loves peanut butter.

04:48.287 --> 04:49.320
(chirping)

04:49.388 --> 04:51.155
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

04:51.223 --> 04:53.591
Why must you keep tormenting me?

04:53.659 --> 04:54.492
I've got bad news.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.294
That insane voice
in your head is you.

04:56.362 --> 04:57.495
No, it's that bird.

04:57.563 --> 04:59.164
I know he's taunting me.

04:59.231 --> 05:02.033
If I could just understand
what he's saying.

05:03.502 --> 05:05.670
Hey, everybody, look
at this pathetic tub-o-fur

05:05.738 --> 05:08.440
who couldn't catch a bird
if his life depended on it.

05:08.507 --> 05:11.409
Now it's personal.

05:11.476 --> 05:13.578
One double vanilla latte
with a dash of cinnamon

05:13.646 --> 05:14.779
to kick it up a notch.

05:14.847 --> 05:15.780
Thanks, but...

05:15.847 --> 05:18.082
who needs cinnamon
when I got your smile?

05:21.252 --> 05:23.020
The number one perk
about this job--

05:23.088 --> 05:25.055
besides the low pay
and bad hours--

05:25.123 --> 05:27.858
is getting to flirt with
every cute guy in Westbridge.

05:27.926 --> 05:30.394
Hey, an anonymous valentine
showed up at our house today.

05:30.462 --> 05:32.030
Maybe it's
from one of these guys.

05:32.097 --> 05:34.431
You got an
anonymous valentine.

05:34.499 --> 05:36.601
The girl with the
devoted boyfriend

05:36.668 --> 05:38.169
also gets the
secret admirer?

05:38.237 --> 05:39.637
And they say
life isn't fair.

05:39.705 --> 05:42.740
We're out of
fat-free muffins

05:42.808 --> 05:45.610
so push these calcium-rich
cheese Danish.

05:45.677 --> 05:48.145
So, any big plans
for Valentine's Day?

05:48.213 --> 05:51.515
A gondola-riffic night out
with Harvey-- nothing special.

05:52.450 --> 05:53.418
Though it appears

05:53.486 --> 05:56.187
our Sabrina may have
a secret admirer.

05:56.255 --> 05:57.222
Oh, really.

05:57.289 --> 05:58.556
Any ideas?

05:58.624 --> 06:01.493
Like any secret admirer,
he prefers to remain anonymous.

06:03.795 --> 06:04.796
(hiccups)

06:06.198 --> 06:07.565
Are you okay?

06:07.632 --> 06:11.368
Oh! Got to stop wolfing
down those pickled eggs.

06:13.438 --> 06:16.074
Cute and she eats
like a trucker.

06:16.141 --> 06:18.542
Apparently, if you're
in love with someone

06:18.610 --> 06:22.113
even their involuntary muscle
contractions are endearing.

06:22.181 --> 06:24.348
There are lots of ways
of trapping a bird.

06:24.416 --> 06:27.518
The simplest is the box-
and-the-piece-of-string method.

06:27.585 --> 06:28.753
(chuckling)

06:28.821 --> 06:31.623
What animal would be slow enough
to get caught...

06:31.690 --> 06:34.258
Whoa! What happened?

06:34.326 --> 06:35.793
I don't understand
why you aren't

06:35.861 --> 06:38.296
more interested
in who sent you
this valentine.

06:38.364 --> 06:40.064
Because for every handsome,
debonair man

06:40.132 --> 06:41.432
that might have sent it,

06:41.500 --> 06:43.667
there's a guy named Chester
with a plate in his head.

06:43.735 --> 06:45.770
I just want to see you happy.

06:45.837 --> 06:47.137
I couldn't be happier.

06:47.205 --> 06:49.006
Now, if you'll excuse me,

06:49.074 --> 06:50.308
I'll be up in the attic.

06:50.375 --> 06:51.876
While you're up there

06:51.944 --> 06:53.945
could you grab me
some buckshot, honey bee?

06:54.012 --> 06:55.780
I want to show Salem here
how to load a musket.

06:55.847 --> 06:59.684
I think honey bee's
got some 'splaining to do.

06:59.751 --> 07:01.920
What does "stay in
the attic" mean to you?

07:01.987 --> 07:03.054
Don't worry-- your cat said

07:03.122 --> 07:04.956
he'd warn me
at the first sign of trouble.

07:05.023 --> 07:06.924
Watch out. Here they come.

07:06.991 --> 07:08.826
Hilda, I can't believe...

07:08.893 --> 07:10.695
Hold on, you wouldn't want
to hurt a person who...

07:10.763 --> 07:14.298
someone apparently
loves very much.

07:14.366 --> 07:15.900
Hey.

07:15.968 --> 07:18.269
Hope you're not still mad
about Valentine's Day

07:18.337 --> 07:22.006
but I brought you
a chocolate kiss and a real one.

07:22.073 --> 07:23.541
(hiccups)

07:23.609 --> 07:26.877
Number one cure for hiccups--
spoonful of sugar.

07:26.945 --> 07:28.880
Yes, but only the special
sugar we have at home.

07:28.981 --> 07:30.248
See ya.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.051
She's still mad.

07:34.119 --> 07:37.755
This weekend,
I'm buying myself a calendar.

07:37.823 --> 07:40.091
Even though our paths only
crossed for an instant,

07:40.159 --> 07:42.893
you'll always have a
special place in my heart.

07:42.961 --> 07:44.729
Ditto.

07:48.801 --> 07:52.103
Boy, I'm really going
to miss him.

07:52.170 --> 07:53.437
And now I'm done.

07:53.505 --> 07:55.072
Do you want to get pedicures?

07:55.140 --> 07:56.807
You know, you should
never have broken

07:56.875 --> 07:57.875
the Other Realm rules

07:57.943 --> 08:00.077
and kept him up in the attic
all that time.

08:00.145 --> 08:01.846
The basement was moldy.

08:01.913 --> 08:04.214
And now you're all alone.

08:04.282 --> 08:06.116
Oh, you poor dear.

08:06.184 --> 08:07.084
Interesting.

08:07.152 --> 08:09.587
You were less irritating
when you were angry.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.923
You are so brave.

08:11.990 --> 08:14.525
I am not going to rest

08:14.593 --> 08:17.061
until I find out
who sent you this valentine.

08:17.129 --> 08:18.462
How are you going
to do that?

08:18.530 --> 08:20.331
Interview every guy
I've ever dated?

08:21.399 --> 08:23.101
Excuse me.

08:25.037 --> 08:26.470
All right, all right.

08:26.538 --> 08:29.774
All the A's over
by the cash register, please,

08:29.842 --> 08:31.843
and have your
handwriting samples out

08:31.910 --> 08:33.244
and ready for analysis.

08:33.312 --> 08:36.179
I know this isn't the
point of this exercise

08:36.246 --> 08:39.082
but some of these guys
owe me money, too.

08:39.150 --> 08:39.984
It's not fair.

08:40.051 --> 08:41.251
I haven't used my magic.

08:41.318 --> 08:42.419
I haven't done a spell.

08:42.453 --> 08:44.022
I haven't disobeyed my aunts

08:44.089 --> 08:46.624
and yet, I'm hiccuping
sparkly pink hearts.

08:46.691 --> 08:48.959
Yep, life's
just one big adventure.

08:49.027 --> 08:52.963
And speaking of adventure,
come with me deep into the bush

08:53.031 --> 08:55.633
as we stalk
the elusive dickey bird.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.802
Sometimes I think you actually
work at being annoying.

08:57.869 --> 08:59.670
No, not really.

09:00.405 --> 09:02.673
So that was a dead end,

09:02.741 --> 09:05.143
but I think, if
we systematically
retrace your steps

09:05.210 --> 09:06.610
over the last
three months...

09:06.678 --> 09:09.614
Sometimes I think you actually
work at being annoying.

09:09.681 --> 09:11.382
No, not really.

09:13.718 --> 09:15.519
Where have you been?

09:15.654 --> 09:17.087
Sweaty brow,
panicked expression,

09:17.155 --> 09:18.856
frantically looking
through the magic book--

09:18.924 --> 09:20.691
just what every parent
wants to come home to.

09:20.759 --> 09:21.392
Look.

09:21.460 --> 09:23.660
(hiccups)

09:23.728 --> 09:25.530
Sabrina, this looks serious.

09:25.530 --> 09:27.331
What's the matter with you?

09:27.399 --> 09:28.732
It's a very funny story.

09:28.800 --> 09:29.933
I don't know!

09:30.001 --> 09:32.070
You put Sabrina to bed;
I'll call Cupid.

09:32.137 --> 09:33.437
Cupid?
Cupid.

09:33.505 --> 09:34.939
He handles all
heart-related matters--

09:34.973 --> 09:36.474
literal or figurative.

09:36.542 --> 09:38.609
And who gives the second
opinion, the Easter bunny?

09:41.246 --> 09:42.847
What's with
the getup, bwana?

09:42.915 --> 09:45.049
I'm going big-game hunting.

09:45.116 --> 09:47.251
Looks like a big game
doodied on your hat.

09:47.319 --> 09:50.621
Yeah? Well, it happened
to Hemingway all the time.

09:50.689 --> 09:53.558
Wow. Your heart's
beating louder
(heart beating loudly)

09:53.625 --> 09:56.694
than the bass on a
Deadhead's boom box.

09:56.762 --> 09:57.661
Oh, I can't imagine why.

09:57.729 --> 09:58.996
My anxiety level is

09:59.064 --> 10:00.865
in "there aren't enough
lifeboats" territory.

10:00.932 --> 10:03.467
Finally.
Where's Cupid?

10:03.534 --> 10:05.335
Well, Cupid's a little backed up
with Valentine's Day,

10:05.403 --> 10:07.371
so he had to send his assistant.

10:07.438 --> 10:08.472
Where's the patient?

10:08.540 --> 10:09.974
Roland?

10:10.042 --> 10:11.408
Okay, you've scared me,

10:11.476 --> 10:13.111
but I've still
got the hiccups.

10:13.178 --> 10:14.545
You know,
some people collect stamps.

10:14.612 --> 10:16.480
Other people
seem to collect jobs.

10:16.548 --> 10:19.350
Helping people find love
is my true calling.

10:19.417 --> 10:21.418
Plus, I already had the outfit.

10:21.486 --> 10:23.454
So, what seems
to be the problem?

10:23.521 --> 10:24.955
Well, my heart
is racing,

10:25.023 --> 10:27.591
I'm hiccuping valentines,
and you're in my bedroom.

10:27.659 --> 10:29.594
How can you make
all three go away?

10:29.661 --> 10:31.328
Oh, Sabrina, calm down.

10:31.396 --> 10:32.362
I'm sure
Roland can help.

10:32.398 --> 10:34.097
Sorry. I meant that
to sound sincere.

10:35.367 --> 10:36.467
(chirping)

10:36.535 --> 10:39.136
Now you mock me
in front of my family?

10:39.204 --> 10:40.170
Why you...

10:40.973 --> 10:42.173
Salem, no!

10:42.241 --> 10:43.574
(grunting, thud)

10:43.641 --> 10:46.143
My spleen!

10:46.211 --> 10:49.280
Oh.
I'm okay!

10:49.348 --> 10:50.815
Uh, he's got nine lives,
people, and I'm working on

10:50.882 --> 10:52.516
the only one I
got over here.

10:52.584 --> 10:54.752
Well, I really
won't know anything

10:54.819 --> 10:56.053
until I open her up.

10:56.121 --> 10:56.954
Open me up?

10:57.022 --> 10:58.789
I may be
the only one concerned here,

10:58.857 --> 11:01.158
but he's not a real doctor
and I'm a bleeder.

11:01.226 --> 11:03.027
The key to your heart.

11:03.095 --> 11:04.996
No, that's to the Volvo.

11:06.097 --> 11:07.832
Here it is.

11:11.169 --> 11:12.269
Allow me.

11:12.337 --> 11:13.604
What are you going to do?

11:13.672 --> 11:15.339
I knew I should have
gotten the club.

11:15.406 --> 11:18.142
ZELDA:
There's the problem.

11:18.209 --> 11:20.344
Your heart is made
of valentine's candy.

11:20.412 --> 11:21.646
Oh, good.

11:21.713 --> 11:24.315
I was afraid it was going to be
something <i>serious.</i>

11:31.756 --> 11:33.590
Okthat says, "Be mine.rt
that's mNo, be mine."ine candy

11:33.659 --> 11:35.192
Why is this happening to me?

11:35.260 --> 11:36.594
I eat oat bran.
(hinges squeaking)

11:36.661 --> 11:38.095
Not a huge priority,
but you might think

11:38.162 --> 11:39.363
about getting your
hinges oiled.

11:39.431 --> 11:41.231
Well, Roland, don't
just stand there

11:41.299 --> 11:42.632
fingering your
tunic; help her.

11:42.667 --> 11:45.102
I'll see what I can
find in the magic book.

11:45.170 --> 11:47.037
I remember this
from the training manual.

11:47.105 --> 11:48.638
Your condition is very serious.

11:48.706 --> 11:50.842
You must follow
my instructions precisely.

11:50.909 --> 11:52.210
What do I have to do?

11:52.277 --> 11:53.144
First, take my hand.

11:53.211 --> 11:54.612
Then what?

11:54.679 --> 11:55.646
Be patient.

11:55.714 --> 11:58.182
(humming)

11:58.249 --> 11:59.583
Is this supposed
to make me feel better?

11:59.651 --> 12:01.451
I don't know about you,
but I'm in heaven.

12:01.519 --> 12:02.887
Get out.

12:02.955 --> 12:05.055
What do you want from me?
I'm just a temp.

12:05.123 --> 12:06.757
These wings
aren't even real.

12:08.159 --> 12:09.694
Here it is.

12:09.728 --> 12:11.862
Candy heart syndrome.

12:11.930 --> 12:13.931
Well, Roland was right
about one thing.

12:13.999 --> 12:15.733
Your condition
is quite serious.

12:15.801 --> 12:17.935
"A witch gets it
only around Valentine's Day

12:18.002 --> 12:20.304
when two mortals are vying
for her heart."

12:20.371 --> 12:21.672
Two? What two?

12:21.740 --> 12:23.674
Harvey's the only one vying
for my heart--

12:23.742 --> 12:25.676
well, at least
before it was chewable.

12:25.744 --> 12:26.743
There must be someone else.

12:26.811 --> 12:28.612
Hilda, I'm so sorry...

12:28.680 --> 12:31.983
but this means that, that
valentine wasn't for you.

12:32.050 --> 12:33.483
It was for Sabrina.

12:33.551 --> 12:36.153
(deadpan voice):
Oh, no. I'm crushed.
I can't go on.

12:36.221 --> 12:39.590
Smirk, though your heart
is breaking.

12:39.658 --> 12:41.225
Oh, yeah, you know,
Aunt Hilda's problem's

12:41.293 --> 12:43.794
a lot more monumental than
the girl with the candy heart.

12:43.862 --> 12:45.129
Yeah. It's true.
Sabrina's right.

12:45.196 --> 12:47.865
We have to focus all of our
attention and support on her.

12:47.932 --> 12:48.999
All of it.

12:49.067 --> 12:50.534
SALEM:
Help! Emergency!

12:50.602 --> 12:51.602
Come quick!

12:51.669 --> 12:52.803
Be right back.

12:52.871 --> 12:54.572
It did sound dire.

12:54.639 --> 12:57.374
Well, no one can say
they coddle me.

12:57.442 --> 12:59.543
(sobbing)

12:59.610 --> 13:01.545
Salem, what's
the matter?

13:01.613 --> 13:03.647
I killed him.

13:03.715 --> 13:06.450
I landed on him
when I fell out of the tree.

13:06.518 --> 13:08.519
All I wanted to do was
scare, humiliate

13:08.587 --> 13:10.454
and emotionally scar him
for life.

13:10.522 --> 13:12.189
I didn't want to hurt him.

13:13.091 --> 13:14.825
He's still breathing.

13:14.893 --> 13:16.994
Do birdie CPR-- stat.

13:17.062 --> 13:19.563
One, two, three, four, five.

13:19.630 --> 13:20.798
Breathe.

13:20.866 --> 13:21.465
(sighs)

13:21.533 --> 13:22.900
Sorry to keep harping

13:22.968 --> 13:24.268
about this, but...

13:24.335 --> 13:25.837
it says in this book
that my symptoms are going

13:25.904 --> 13:28.339
to get progressively worse
over the next couple of hours.

13:28.406 --> 13:29.706
How can they get any worse?

13:29.774 --> 13:31.208
(heart beating loudly)

13:31.275 --> 13:33.344
Well, that's one way.

13:33.411 --> 13:36.981
Do you think anyone will believe
I have a live ferret in my bra?

13:37.048 --> 13:38.548
He's alive!
(bird chirping)

13:38.616 --> 13:40.417
Thank you, big guy.

13:40.485 --> 13:42.686
Okay, next crisis.

13:42.754 --> 13:45.189
Sabrina, you've got to stop
one of those mortals

13:45.256 --> 13:46.624
from vying for your heart.

13:46.692 --> 13:49.059
If you don't, you'll become
cold and heartless

13:49.127 --> 13:50.327
and unable to love anyone.

13:50.395 --> 13:51.561
Not even Harvey.

13:51.629 --> 13:52.596
What? But how can I get

13:52.664 --> 13:54.498
a complete stranger
to stop liking me?

13:54.566 --> 13:57.401
I know, I got to figure out
who sent me that valentine.

13:57.469 --> 13:58.970
I have an idea.

13:59.037 --> 14:01.305
We'll check out every boy
you ever met.

14:01.373 --> 14:02.740
Oh, no.
We're not going

14:02.808 --> 14:04.942
through that again.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.177
I suppose you have
a better idea.

14:07.245 --> 14:09.279
Yes, I'm calling in
a valentine expert.

14:09.347 --> 14:11.782
No!

14:11.849 --> 14:13.483
Did you not hear me say, "No!"?

14:13.551 --> 14:16.653
Well, if it isn't the girls
from ungrateful junction.

14:16.721 --> 14:18.989
Can't handle this one
without me, huh?

14:19.056 --> 14:21.158
Is there some extra
fee we can pay

14:21.226 --> 14:22.860
for you to drop
the attitude?

14:22.928 --> 14:24.495
Just tell me who sent
this valentine.

14:24.563 --> 14:27.898
Give me one good reason why
I should help you do anything.

14:27.965 --> 14:30.635
Because if you don't, your wings
will no longer be on your back

14:30.702 --> 14:33.203
but someplace
much more uncomfortable.

14:33.271 --> 14:36.173
Oh, well,
I guess we have a deal then.

14:40.044 --> 14:41.979
Old cherub party trick.

14:45.617 --> 14:46.584
Josh?

14:46.651 --> 14:48.519
Josh is my secret admirer?

14:48.587 --> 14:50.688
And he still only
pays me $5.25 an hour?

14:50.755 --> 14:52.756
Well, there's a little matter
of my fee.

14:52.824 --> 14:55.859
Sabrina, you have to
find Josh and get him

14:55.927 --> 14:57.628
to stop liking you.

14:57.695 --> 14:59.463
Unless you want to be
the kind of person who wears

14:59.531 --> 15:00.864
their heart on their sleeve,
literally.

15:00.932 --> 15:02.566
Hey, look, it stopped.

15:02.633 --> 15:04.634
I must be getting better.

15:04.702 --> 15:05.770
(music playing)

15:05.837 --> 15:07.204
I know I'm going to regret
asking this

15:07.271 --> 15:08.706
but what's that music?

15:08.773 --> 15:10.373
I think it's
Jack Benny's

15:10.441 --> 15:11.909
old theme song,
"Love In Bloom."

15:11.976 --> 15:14.612
¶ You know it isn't a dream ¶

15:14.679 --> 15:16.747
¶ It's love in bloom. ¶

15:16.814 --> 15:18.482
(imitating Benny):
Now, cut that out.

15:18.550 --> 15:21.752
Okay, so the consensus is
I'm <i>not</i> getting better.

15:21.820 --> 15:23.620
Josh, I need
to talk to you.

15:23.688 --> 15:25.422
Hey, you're back.

15:25.490 --> 15:27.224
Got that esophagus
under control?

15:27.291 --> 15:28.225
(music playing)

15:28.293 --> 15:29.527
What's with the cheesy Muzak?

15:29.594 --> 15:31.195
I thought the stereo was busted.

15:31.262 --> 15:32.897
Can I use your jacket?

15:32.931 --> 15:34.398
I'm a little chilled.

15:34.466 --> 15:37.100
I'll bring it right back.

15:37.168 --> 15:38.736
(music muffled)

15:38.804 --> 15:40.004
Okay, now it stopped.

15:40.071 --> 15:41.005
Am I going crazy?

15:41.072 --> 15:42.472
No, <i>you</i> are.

15:42.540 --> 15:44.674
What's with the jackets?

15:44.742 --> 15:46.109
Uh, kleptomania--

15:46.177 --> 15:47.978
one of my many
obnoxious qualities.

15:48.045 --> 15:50.314
You don't have
any obnoxious qualities.

15:50.348 --> 15:52.382
Sure, I do. Dozens.

15:52.450 --> 15:53.684
I can...

15:53.751 --> 15:55.119
Well, there...

15:55.186 --> 15:56.854
I can be so...

15:56.921 --> 15:57.754
Cute?

15:57.822 --> 15:59.190
Really? You think so?

15:59.257 --> 16:01.058
No, no, no, no.
No, no. Never.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.793
I am so the
opposite of cute.

16:04.562 --> 16:06.363
Curses!
Done in by my own cuteness

16:06.431 --> 16:08.198
and lack of obnoxious qualities.

16:08.266 --> 16:10.567
Well, if I can't get him
to stop liking me

16:10.635 --> 16:12.903
I'll just get him
to like someone else.

16:12.971 --> 16:15.772
Hey, um, Josh,
have you ever noticed...

16:15.840 --> 16:17.908
¶ It's love in bloom! ¶

16:19.177 --> 16:20.978
Well, well, have you?

16:21.045 --> 16:22.846
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

16:22.914 --> 16:25.282
SALEM:
Is there anything else I can do?

16:25.350 --> 16:27.017
Fluff your pillow?

16:27.085 --> 16:28.818
Regurgitate a worm?

16:28.886 --> 16:30.020
(chirping)

16:30.088 --> 16:32.489
No! No more TV for you--

16:32.557 --> 16:34.924
not since you flatlined
during <i>Popular.</i>

16:34.992 --> 16:36.827
Do you believe
in love at first sight?

16:36.895 --> 16:38.362
Maybe.

16:38.430 --> 16:40.597
Yeah, sure. I guess I'm
something of a romantic.

16:40.665 --> 16:41.598
Great.

16:41.666 --> 16:42.933
Hey, come here.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.835
What do you think?
Do you see love?

16:44.902 --> 16:47.371
No, but I do see a very
terrified customer.

16:47.439 --> 16:52.276
¶ Oh, no, it isn't the spring,
it's love in bloom. ¶

16:52.343 --> 16:53.544
Sabrina, are you okay?

16:53.611 --> 16:54.979
Yeah, fine.
Oh, what about her?

16:55.046 --> 16:56.313
She's cute.

16:56.381 --> 16:58.214
¶ It's love in bloom. ¶

16:58.282 --> 16:59.416
What's the matter with you?

16:59.484 --> 17:00.584
Why do you keep
singing that song?

17:00.652 --> 17:02.552
I'm a crazy, insane person--
the kind of person

17:02.620 --> 17:05.288
no one would ever have a secret
crush on, wouldn't you agree?

17:05.356 --> 17:06.423
Not really.

17:06.491 --> 17:08.258
But maybe you should take
the rest of the day off.

17:08.326 --> 17:10.094
Relax, get some sleep...

17:10.161 --> 17:11.528
learn a new song.

17:14.633 --> 17:17.067
The color's coming back
to his beak.

17:17.135 --> 17:18.669
The insurance companies
are right.

17:18.737 --> 17:21.571
Untrained and unqualified people
<i>can</i> treat the sick.

17:21.640 --> 17:22.439
(phone rings)

17:22.507 --> 17:23.440
Hello?

17:23.508 --> 17:24.773
SABRINA:
Hey, it's me.

17:24.842 --> 17:26.743
I just wanted to let you know
the music stopped.

17:26.810 --> 17:28.178
Oh, that's great.

17:28.246 --> 17:29.580
(bird chirping)

17:29.647 --> 17:31.215
Oh, is that stupid feather-butt
dead yet?

17:31.283 --> 17:33.450
When he finally kicks it,
make sure you flush him.

17:33.518 --> 17:36.053
Sabrina, are
you all right?

17:36.120 --> 17:37.488
Hey, watch it, buddy.

17:37.556 --> 17:39.456
Not everybody likes dogs.

17:39.524 --> 17:43.427
I swear, the blind think
the world owes them something.

17:43.495 --> 17:44.528
Something's wrong.

17:44.595 --> 17:45.929
Oh, you think?

17:45.996 --> 17:48.099
Look, I don't have time to keep
yappin' with you broads.

17:48.166 --> 17:50.167
I got to go talk to Josh;
I've been way too nice to him.

17:50.235 --> 17:51.602
I got to tell the pathetic loser

17:51.670 --> 17:54.271
that he's got to get a grip
and move on.

17:54.339 --> 17:55.906
Sabrina, wait.
(dial tone)

17:55.973 --> 17:57.408
Oh, no.

17:57.476 --> 17:59.042
Sabrina's
becoming heartless.

17:59.077 --> 18:00.711
If we don't do
something soon

18:00.778 --> 18:02.579
she'll be unable
to love anyone.

18:02.647 --> 18:05.082
We've got to get Josh
to stop liking Sabrina.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.351
I think we both know
what we have to do.

18:07.419 --> 18:08.852
If you must, you must.

18:10.788 --> 18:13.723
This is really going to cost you
this time.

18:13.791 --> 18:16.193
Hey, Juan Valdez,
we need to talk.

18:16.261 --> 18:17.828
Sabrina, how's your stomach?

18:17.896 --> 18:19.429
I brought you another kiss.

18:19.497 --> 18:21.332
Well, they never
said which boy

18:21.399 --> 18:23.000
I had to make
stop liking me.

18:23.968 --> 18:25.202
Wait, Roland,

18:25.270 --> 18:26.903
you can't go in there
dressed like that.

18:26.971 --> 18:29.372
College place...

18:29.441 --> 18:31.207
I've got just the outfit!

18:32.443 --> 18:33.844
Oh, yeah--

18:33.911 --> 18:36.513
the wings would have been
must less noticeable.

18:36.580 --> 18:37.781
Look, there's Sabrina.

18:37.816 --> 18:39.216
Oh, no.
She's with Harvey.

18:39.284 --> 18:40.884
I hope we're not too late.

18:40.952 --> 18:42.653
Wow. Sure is
an awfully long list

18:42.721 --> 18:44.721
of things you don't like
about me.

18:44.789 --> 18:46.890
Did I mention
"stating the obvious"?

18:46.958 --> 18:48.058
ZELDA:
There's Josh.

18:48.126 --> 18:49.026
Shoot him.

18:49.093 --> 18:50.694
He has to stop liking Sabrina.

18:50.762 --> 18:52.596
What-- and clear the way
for farm boy?

18:52.664 --> 18:54.197
Are you kidding?

18:54.265 --> 18:57.268
I've been waiting for Sabrina
to tell him off for years.

18:57.335 --> 18:59.002
Sabrina, what's the matter
with you?

18:59.070 --> 19:01.472
Why are you saying all this?
Don't you love me?

19:01.539 --> 19:02.839
Love? Hah!

19:02.907 --> 19:04.174
What's love?

19:04.242 --> 19:06.243
No, everything is just fine.

19:06.277 --> 19:08.445
If I can't have Sabrina,
nobody can.

19:08.512 --> 19:09.813
I don't love...

19:09.881 --> 19:11.248
I don't love...

19:11.315 --> 19:13.316
if you won't do your job,
then I will.

19:13.384 --> 19:14.718
(blowing)

19:17.655 --> 19:20.290
I don't love anyone but you.

19:21.893 --> 19:23.527
Hi. I'm Josh, Capricorn.

19:23.594 --> 19:27.197
I enjoy long walks, foreign
films and your eyes.

19:28.332 --> 19:30.501
You did that on purpose.

19:30.568 --> 19:33.037
A frivolous rebound
is exactly what you need.

19:33.104 --> 19:35.271
What I need
is to be an only child.

19:35.339 --> 19:36.840
Tell me everything
about you.

19:36.908 --> 19:38.241
Don't leave anything out.

19:38.310 --> 19:39.643
I'm already fascinated.

19:39.711 --> 19:41.444
Okay, junior.

19:41.512 --> 19:42.646
I'm so sorry.

19:42.714 --> 19:44.748
It must have been a
weird reaction to that...

19:44.815 --> 19:46.983
special sugar at my house;
can you forgive me?

19:47.051 --> 19:48.552
Of course.

19:48.620 --> 19:50.954
I knew it couldn't
really be you.

19:51.022 --> 19:54.391
You have the biggest heart
of anyone I know.

19:54.458 --> 19:56.226
ROLAND:
Hey, farm boy.

19:56.294 --> 19:57.294
Roland?!

19:57.361 --> 19:59.196
What's your cousin doing here?

19:59.263 --> 20:00.964
This.
Roland!

20:01.032 --> 20:02.700
Are you okay?

20:04.802 --> 20:06.904
Ms. Spellman,
I never realized

20:06.971 --> 20:10.541
what a devastatingly
attractive woman you are.

20:10.608 --> 20:11.608
Or that I'd ever use

20:11.676 --> 20:14.611
the word "devastatingly"
in a sentence.

20:14.679 --> 20:16.113
Happy Valentine's Day!

20:16.180 --> 20:19.383
And now it's time for
the Valentine's Day <i>massacre.</i>

20:25.623 --> 20:27.757
Oh, aurora borealis.

20:27.825 --> 20:30.894
Look at the stars, Harvey.

20:30.961 --> 20:33.763
I'd rather see them reflected
in your eyes.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.601
Come on, what are you,

20:37.668 --> 20:40.304
three, four years older
than me, tops?

20:40.371 --> 20:42.238
Try 597.

20:42.307 --> 20:43.874
Love can overcome that.

20:43.941 --> 20:45.942
Can I peel you
another grape?

20:46.010 --> 20:47.311
Whatever.

20:49.213 --> 20:52.583
Well, thank you for the worst
Valentine's Day of my life.

20:52.651 --> 20:54.418
House calls are pricey.

20:54.485 --> 20:56.052
Besides, like I told you,

20:56.120 --> 20:58.522
everything will go back
to normal after tonight.

20:58.589 --> 21:00.056
Milk Dud?

21:00.124 --> 21:02.726
(bird chirping)

21:02.794 --> 21:04.795
Sing us a song of love.

21:04.863 --> 21:06.864
Sabrina, to paraphrase

21:06.898 --> 21:09.400
the great Rod McKuen,
love is like...

21:09.467 --> 21:11.402
(yelling)

21:12.305 --> 21:18.591
