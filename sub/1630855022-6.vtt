WEBVTT

00:39.957 --> 00:42.125
Hey, off the ice till the door's closed!

00:42.125 --> 00:45.212
Off the ice! Get off the ice!

00:45.212 --> 00:46.338
Get off the--

00:48.340 --> 00:49.591
Get off the goddamn ice!

00:49.591 --> 00:51.343
I am sick of this shit, man.

00:51.343 --> 00:54.638
You know how hard it is
to find a good Zamboni driver?

00:54.638 --> 00:56.849
You think some robot can do what I do?

00:56.849 --> 00:59.601
Clean the ice in seven minutes flat
and never miss a single patch?

00:59.601 --> 01:01.562
You miss patches all the time, Beau.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.313
And I don't mean to be rude,

01:03.313 --> 01:05.691
but I do think a robot could do
what you do.

01:05.691 --> 01:09.653
If you aren't trying to be rude,
then you have failed miserably, Trevor.

01:09.653 --> 01:12.698
There's a problem with authority
in this town

01:12.698 --> 01:15.325
when people start looking down
on the Zamboni driver.

01:15.826 --> 01:19.788
And the mailman. And the mailwoman.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.082
And the janitors.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.419
The people
who are the backbone of society,

01:25.419 --> 01:27.462
who should be treated like heroes!

01:27.462 --> 01:30.174
I'm not gonna be the backbone anymore.

01:30.174 --> 01:34.344
I'm gonna be the frontbone.
So you know what?

01:34.344 --> 01:36.680
I quit!

01:37.806 --> 01:39.266
And I know what you're gonna say.

01:39.266 --> 01:43.270
You're gonna say you need a letter
of resignation and two weeks' notice.

01:43.770 --> 01:47.691
Well, here is my goddamn letter.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.235
I'm gonna need you to finish your shift.

01:50.235 --> 01:51.320
No.

01:52.654 --> 01:56.283
I'm gonna need me to finish my shift.

02:19.598 --> 02:20.599
Dad?

02:21.767 --> 02:23.977
Think someone may have stolen
our dining room table.

02:25.187 --> 02:26.271
Howdy, partner!

02:26.271 --> 02:28.649
Yeah, you were probably wondering
what all the noise was

02:28.649 --> 02:30.192
when I was using the chain saw last night.

02:30.192 --> 02:31.818
I was pretty sure it was a chain saw.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.820
I just didn't want to find out
what you were doing.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.073
I was making the Kovac Saloon!

02:36.615 --> 02:40.619
Yeah, I repurposed the table to make
this bar top since we weren't using it.

02:40.619 --> 02:42.329
I use that table all the time.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.498
It's where I do my homework.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.461
Is this about the "Sheriff" card?

02:49.461 --> 02:53.298
Well, yes and no.
I've always loved Western shit.

02:53.882 --> 02:56.802
And I don't know
what this "Sheriff" card means yet,

02:56.802 --> 02:58.762
but every sheriff needs a saloon.

02:58.762 --> 03:00.055
So I thought I'd start there.

03:00.055 --> 03:04.351
Wouldn't a sheriff have more of a jail?

03:04.351 --> 03:06.061
Maybe so, partner.

03:06.061 --> 03:07.980
But I thought the neighbors
might give me weird looks

03:07.980 --> 03:10.524
if I built a jail in our garage!

03:13.527 --> 03:15.112
If it's making you happy, Dad...

03:16.238 --> 03:19.449
Anyway, I should go. Be careful.

03:20.450 --> 03:21.451
Hey, I was thinking.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.787
You know how Trina said
she cheated on Kolton?

03:27.749 --> 03:28.667
Yeah.

03:28.667 --> 03:32.171
I was wondering if you might have any idea
who she cheated with?

03:34.965 --> 03:36.508
I'm not sure.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.678
I mean it was probably someone
on the basketball team.

03:44.474 --> 03:45.601
Off you go, partner.

04:07.623 --> 04:08.749
Hey, Cass!

04:09.333 --> 04:12.294
Don't look over this way
unless you want to get instantly horny.

04:13.462 --> 04:16.089
- It's too late for that.
- Yeah. You all horned up.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.382
- Why are you wearing that?
- Coach Eagleson resigned

04:18.382 --> 04:20.761
from the basketball team,
so guess who's the new head coach?

04:20.761 --> 04:22.804
Do coaches normally wear jerseys?

04:22.804 --> 04:26.350
This is a breathable fabric,
in case I need to do any drills.

04:26.350 --> 04:28.727
Yeah, so I just wanted to be ready.

04:30.187 --> 04:31.939
Who's "Homeboy"?

04:31.939 --> 04:34.149
Oh, no. It's "Homebody."

04:34.858 --> 04:36.360
This is for Martha.

04:37.694 --> 04:40.739
I hope your mom doesn't find out
that you're making stuff for her ex.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.533
- No.
- Izzy will be in a tizzy.

04:42.533 --> 04:44.618
Well, I hope she is.
She's been lying to me

04:44.618 --> 04:46.620
- about Martha basically my whole life.
- Yeah.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.373
I'm just trying to focus my energy
onto something that is positive.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.875
That's good. 100%.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.211
That's what I'm vibing
with this coaching gig.

04:54.211 --> 04:55.128
Good.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.799
I just made the decision to try
and spread out my potential a bit more.

04:58.799 --> 04:59.925
- Okay.
- You know,

04:59.925 --> 05:03.220
start inspiring kids outside the classroom
as well as inside it.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.304
Well, that's cool.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.598
- It is cool.
- Yeah.

05:06.598 --> 05:09.893
Your potential is good too. Royalty.
I mean, that's great.

05:10.519 --> 05:14.398
But, you know, with a teacher
they can share the potential.

05:14.398 --> 05:16.149
It can spread amongst the youth.

05:17.609 --> 05:20.654
- Like HPV.
- No, not like HPV.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.574
Typical royalty,
looking down your nose at us.

05:23.574 --> 05:26.159
- Well, you got a hole in your shorts.
- I know.

05:34.168 --> 05:38.255
Just because your card says "Painter,"
doesn't mean you should actually paint.

05:39.256 --> 05:40.841
Did Kolton have two lazy eyes?

05:40.841 --> 05:43.385
I mean, it's fine if he did,
I just feel like I'd remember that.

05:43.385 --> 05:45.429
God, it's so bad.

05:49.224 --> 05:51.727
You're not responding to my texts.
Are you mad or something?

05:51.727 --> 05:52.853
I'm not mad.

05:52.853 --> 05:57.316
I just don't understand
why you told my dad you cheated on Kolton.

05:57.316 --> 05:58.734
I was trying to make him feel better.

05:58.734 --> 06:01.570
He was, like,
spiraling out about being a shitty dad.

06:01.570 --> 06:04.698
After you told him, he stayed up all night
chopping the garage up into a saloon.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.825
- What?
- Yep, full chain-saw-in-the-house,

06:06.825 --> 06:07.993
crazy man vibe.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.079
What would he do
if I told him it was with me?

06:11.079 --> 06:15.876
I don't know,
but it could be pretty wild to find out.

06:20.214 --> 06:21.924
Sorry.
I thought I was doing what you wanted.

06:21.924 --> 06:24.843
None of this is what I want.
It's the worst.

06:24.843 --> 06:28.096
My dad's probably gonna take a chain saw
to my face when I get home.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.557
I'm not even supposed
to be talking to you right now.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.142
- What?
- This isn't a real relationship.

06:32.142 --> 06:35.354
And I'm having a really hard time
pretending that we're something we're--

06:35.354 --> 06:37.356
Is this the mural of you and Kolton?

06:37.356 --> 06:39.107
Oh yeah, it's this one here.

06:39.107 --> 06:41.193
- Yeah.
- With the twins.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.490
Sorry, I know you were saying
you're having a tough time pretending,

06:46.490 --> 06:47.991
but I feel like we nailed that.

06:53.747 --> 06:57.501
Okay, boys. Huddle up.
Huddle like a puddle.

06:57.501 --> 07:00.504
So, as we all know,
Coach Eagleson isn't with us

07:00.504 --> 07:03.173
because he's dealing with a bit
of a cheating scandal.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.175
- How was Coach Eagleson cheating?
- He--

07:06.009 --> 07:08.762
He was caught deflating basketballs.

07:09.346 --> 07:10.681
So yeah. Pretty bad.

07:10.681 --> 07:12.432
- How would that help us?
- That's unclear.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.601
I heard he was cheating on his wife
with a woman named Vicky.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.812
That's not true! No, that's-- No.

07:16.812 --> 07:18.438
- That's not true.
- I did hear that.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.315
No. Vicky's just a good friend.
It doesn't mat--

07:20.315 --> 07:23.652
The point is that Principal Pat
has asked me to take over,

07:23.652 --> 07:25.529
and I don't think that she has asked me

07:25.529 --> 07:28.198
because I am a master of the old b-ball--

07:29.241 --> 07:32.995
I am first and foremost a teacher.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.372
Whether that's history

07:35.372 --> 07:38.500
or basic life skills or indeed athletics.

07:38.500 --> 07:42.171
Deerfield Hooves, are you ready?

07:42.171 --> 07:43.255
Sweet Jesus, no.

07:43.255 --> 07:47.467
He is the greatest athlete
that this town has ever known.

07:47.467 --> 07:51.430
He has the most beautiful face and hair.

07:51.430 --> 07:54.558
He is your new head coach.

07:55.726 --> 08:01.815
G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Giorgio!

08:04.109 --> 08:07.196
Let's go, boys! I see you out here!

08:07.196 --> 08:09.531
What's up, Big D? Let's go, fellas!

08:09.531 --> 08:12.534
All right, let's go, little baby boys!

08:12.534 --> 08:15.329
- Let's go, D! Give me this, dog!
- Don't--

08:15.329 --> 08:17.039
Let's go! I'm feelin' nice!

08:17.039 --> 08:18.081
Oh, shit!

08:18.081 --> 08:21.126
Feels so good out here.
Feels like I'm back at home!

08:21.126 --> 08:24.004
Look good, feel good!
Train hard, play hard!

08:24.004 --> 08:25.964
Let's go! Chest pass.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.717
All right, look alive, boys!

08:29.801 --> 08:32.513
Can we help you, Giorgio?
We were just about to begin practice.

08:32.513 --> 08:33.429
Come on, man!

08:33.429 --> 08:35.474
- What do you think I'm doing here?
- Don't know, buddy.

08:35.474 --> 08:38.268
I guess Principal Pat didn't want
to leave these children's dreams

08:38.268 --> 08:40.020
in the hands of a nonathlete.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.395
Why is Mr. Kovac here?

08:44.149 --> 08:47.819
- Oh, nice! Beau, get over here!
- Oh, dear-- No.

08:53.909 --> 08:55.536
Did Principal Pat call him as well?

08:55.536 --> 08:57.412
No, I put this call in.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.289
While Dusty here was riding the bench,

08:59.289 --> 09:02.960
Beau Kovac was the starting point guard
of the Deerfield Hooves

09:02.960 --> 09:05.337
when we went 3-7 our senior year.

09:05.337 --> 09:08.298
Without Beau,
it would've been 1-9 probably.

09:08.298 --> 09:11.760
Okay, I can't just have non-teachers
walking around the gym willy-nilly.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.012
That's all right.
No one needs to call me "Teach."

09:14.012 --> 09:16.265
- You boys can just call me "Coach."
- Great.

09:16.265 --> 09:17.516
Or Coach Sheriff.

09:17.516 --> 09:19.017
So we have three coaches now?

09:19.017 --> 09:23.856
Better to have three coaches
than one who's a cheater.

09:25.607 --> 09:26.733
This is insane.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.195
That's cold.

09:30.195 --> 09:33.198
That's very intense, Beau. I love it!

09:33.198 --> 09:35.826
This is how you go 3-7, fellas!

09:35.826 --> 09:38.495
All right, circle up, top of the key.
Let's get some stretching in.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.622
No, fine, don't listen to me.
I'm just your teacher.

09:40.622 --> 09:44.209
No, that's not true, D.
You're also a whistler, baby.

09:45.127 --> 09:46.378
Don't need it.

09:46.378 --> 09:51.300
Listen, if you don't mind, I'd like
to go friggin' nuts on these boys.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.218
Really test their mental strength.

09:53.218 --> 09:56.096
Yeah, I would definitely mind that.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.807
- Boys, look in my eyes.
- Just take off the hat and be normal.

09:58.807 --> 10:00.017
- We're a team.
- Good.

10:00.601 --> 10:01.435
I'm normal.

10:02.311 --> 10:05.230
This is not just custom sweatshirts,
Mr. Johnson.

10:05.230 --> 10:08.984
Okay, this is a whole new line
of MORPHO-inspired merchandise,

10:08.984 --> 10:11.695
and I'm giving you the chance
to get in on the ground floor.

10:11.695 --> 10:14.698
Wow, I know I would.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.950
I mean, these are all just samples,

10:16.950 --> 10:21.580
but I would buy all
of these little MORPHO key chains.

10:21.580 --> 10:23.624
- They're so cute! Or--
- So cute!

10:23.624 --> 10:24.750
Are you kidding me?

10:24.750 --> 10:29.087
You could get your potential printed
on a bumper sticker?

10:29.087 --> 10:30.172
How fun is that?

10:30.172 --> 10:31.673
- Very fun. So fun.
- So fun.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.550
Wouldn't your mom wanna sell this stuff?

10:34.635 --> 10:36.512
This makes more sense here.

10:36.512 --> 10:40.349
This allows you the chance to build
on all of that machine-based revenue.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.434
- Come on.
- I actually,

10:42.434 --> 10:44.269
don't make anything from the machine.

10:44.269 --> 10:47.981
An alarm goes off if you try to open it,
and I can't get the quarters out.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.817
Well, see! You need this, Mr. Johnson.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.236
I don't know.

10:53.695 --> 10:56.406
I mean,
I'm a MORPHO man as much as anyone,

10:56.406 --> 10:58.951
but what if people lose interest?

10:58.951 --> 11:01.328
What if the novelty wears off?

11:02.329 --> 11:03.664
It's not a novelty.

11:03.664 --> 11:07.084
This isn't the painted rocks
and deer shit you find at Dear Izzy's.

11:07.584 --> 11:11.088
This is something
that actually means something to people.

11:11.088 --> 11:14.550
Something that gives people hope.
And once you--

11:14.550 --> 11:16.593
Once you have hope, you can't let that go.

11:17.761 --> 11:20.055
- Here I go. I'm so sorry.
- Uh-oh, there she goes.

11:20.055 --> 11:23.058
- I have to write that down.
- I wonder how-- What would you do that on?

11:23.058 --> 11:26.311
I know I just wish
I had an adorable notebook.

11:26.937 --> 11:28.480
How cute is that?

11:28.480 --> 11:30.065
I don't know if you know,
I got "Storyteller,"

11:30.065 --> 11:34.278
so I've been following Cass around.
I'm sort of like her royal biographer.

11:34.278 --> 11:37.447
And honestly the things
that she comes up with.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.824
What did you say, Cass?

11:38.824 --> 11:41.952
- Well, it's more than just what I say.
- You're right.

11:43.871 --> 11:44.955
It's what I believe.

11:45.914 --> 11:48.458
Mr. Johnson, I don't want the young people
of this town to grow up

11:48.458 --> 11:52.045
with nothing more to look forward to
than Deerfest and some basketball game.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.548
It's time we invest in dreams.

11:55.340 --> 11:58.719
So, no, you tell me.

12:02.097 --> 12:04.308
Does it seem like a novelty to you?

12:08.729 --> 12:09.897
Set that pick right here.

12:09.897 --> 12:12.983
Roll! Let's go--

12:12.983 --> 12:17.029
- Mamma mia! What's going on, 25?
- I thought you were trying to dunk again.

12:17.029 --> 12:20.073
Well, now you're gonna think about it
while you're sitting on the bench.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.743
- Axel don't bench, man.
- Off you go! Let's roll.

12:22.743 --> 12:23.827
- You fucking--
- Let's go!

12:23.827 --> 12:25.370
- Meatballs ass motherf--
- You're good.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.455
Bring it in.

12:28.957 --> 12:29.958
Circle up!

12:29.958 --> 12:31.251
What's up, Axel?

12:32.377 --> 12:33.587
How's the team this year?

12:34.379 --> 12:35.547
It's not good, Mr. Kovac.

12:35.547 --> 12:38.258
And to be honest,
it's really hard to focus.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.844
This MORPHO machine
is making all the grown-ups weird,

12:41.386 --> 12:43.388
and things were already weird
without Kolton.

12:44.806 --> 12:47.935
I know you guys miss him. I miss him too.

12:50.812 --> 12:53.815
But all we can do now
is try to win some games for him.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.234
Take out the bad guys.

12:55.234 --> 12:57.402
Are there any bad guys on this team?

12:58.237 --> 12:59.571
Anyone you don't trust?

13:00.155 --> 13:01.823
- Like, in a game?
- Yeah.

13:01.823 --> 13:05.827
Anyone seem distracted by other things?

13:06.995 --> 13:11.917
'Cause in my day, the biggest distraction
was girls, i.e. females.

13:11.917 --> 13:13.961
Know if any of these guys are dating,

13:14.461 --> 13:18.674
or, like, which of these boys
might be considered the most attractive?

13:19.842 --> 13:22.094
Beau, that is wildly inappropriate.

13:22.594 --> 13:24.513
Hey, these kids can't win
if they aren't focused.

13:24.513 --> 13:29.560
I'm just asking Axel which one
of these boys is popular with the girls.

13:31.687 --> 13:33.772
Or maybe even other people's girls.

13:35.107 --> 13:36.692
- Maybe Tucker.
- Really?

13:36.692 --> 13:38.151
That guy?

13:38.652 --> 13:41.697
He's not even half as cute as Kolton.
You're telling me he gets laid?

13:41.697 --> 13:42.823
Okay.

13:43.866 --> 13:44.908
That's practice.

13:47.536 --> 13:50.163
Beau. Come on, man.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.083
Boundaries. We're their superiors.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.335
We're their teachers and their coaches.

13:56.253 --> 13:58.213
We're supposed to be leading by example.

13:58.213 --> 14:02.634
Man, you guys see that Fucker kid?
Dude's built like a brick shithouse.

14:02.634 --> 14:04.928
I bet he pulls some serious poontang
around here.

14:04.928 --> 14:08.223
Okay, his name is Tucker, and
it is not okay to talk like that, Giorgio.

14:08.223 --> 14:09.766
For real? I've been calling him Fucker.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.268
- I thought it was a nickname.
- Do you--

14:11.268 --> 14:12.853
How do you know he's good with the ladies?

14:12.853 --> 14:15.355
I see him at the restaurant
all the time chatting up the waitresses.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.024
My daughter works at the restaurant.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.151
Yeah, D. A lot of people's daughters work
at the restaurant,

14:19.151 --> 14:20.319
and they all say the same thing.

14:20.319 --> 14:23.155
Fucker's like a young Giorgio,
and he could get it.

14:23.155 --> 14:25.407
Okay, let's call it a day, folks.

14:26.408 --> 14:29.661
Come back tomorrow. Hopefully, we'll have
some clarity on the leadership situation.

14:30.454 --> 14:33.540
What's the rush?
Let's keep these good vibes going.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.168
What say we all head back
to my saloon for some team bonding?

14:36.168 --> 14:38.003
- That doesn't seem like a good idea.
- All of us?

14:38.003 --> 14:41.507
Yeah, man,
definitely Kolton's friends for sure.

14:41.507 --> 14:42.883
Tucker, you in?

14:42.883 --> 14:44.009
Sounds good.

14:44.009 --> 14:47.846
Oh nice, Fucker. I'm 100% in.

14:47.846 --> 14:50.807
D, if you gotta stay
and practice whistling--

14:50.807 --> 14:52.559
No.

14:52.559 --> 14:55.354
I'll come. Want to make sure
there's at least one grown-up there.

14:57.773 --> 15:00.275
Does anybody got room in their trunk
for my scooter?

15:10.953 --> 15:12.371
Do you know where the clay is?

15:12.996 --> 15:13.997
Over there.

15:14.665 --> 15:15.666
Cool.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.961
So, remember when I said
I didn't want to hang out with you

15:18.961 --> 15:21.421
because you're, like, in mourning?

15:22.673 --> 15:23.924
I'm sorry that I said that.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.719
I'm not the best at, like,
speaking sometimes.

15:28.428 --> 15:32.683
And just so you know,
Megan's party was pretty dumb. And boring.

15:33.559 --> 15:38.397
Well, just so you know, dumb and boring
is, like, very appealing to me right now.

15:41.149 --> 15:45.320
I heard Kyle broke up with Megan because
she got "Secretary" as her potential?

15:45.320 --> 15:48.782
I think that's pretty fucked.
She could be, like, Secretary of State.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.200
I know, but apparently, she, like,

15:50.200 --> 15:54.913
immediately hooked up with Matt Reinders
in the cemetery, and he got "Famous."

15:56.999 --> 16:00.460
Hey, so, I saw you talking to Jacob
by the mural earlier.

16:01.211 --> 16:03.839
Do you guys, like, hang out or...

16:05.883 --> 16:06.800
Not really.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.595
We, like, talk about Kolton sometimes,
but that's about it.

16:09.595 --> 16:12.222
Do you know if he wants a girlfriend?

16:15.017 --> 16:21.106
Yeah. I think he wants someone
he can go on dates with,

16:21.899 --> 16:24.151
- hold hands with, do, like--
- So like a girlfriend?

16:25.152 --> 16:26.695
Do you think I should ask him out?

16:30.616 --> 16:31.617
Why not?

16:42.544 --> 16:45.631
Don't be surprised if you feel like
you've suddenly traveled back in time

16:45.631 --> 16:47.090
to the Wild West, boys.

16:48.133 --> 16:50.594
I built this all myself
in just a couple days.

16:50.594 --> 16:56.350
It's mostly pine plywood,
but this bar top here is solid oak.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.560
Not that any of you kids are gonna care.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.104
You've probably never worked
with your hands a day in your life.

17:01.104 --> 17:04.066
I think
that this is actually a brown maple.

17:04.066 --> 17:06.652
Yeah, see, the grain pattern? Straight.

17:06.652 --> 17:09.946
And right here, if you look, you can see
there's some mineral streaking going on.

17:09.946 --> 17:12.199
No! It's oak.

17:15.786 --> 17:16.787
Anyway.

17:17.371 --> 17:18.872
Your generation didn't grow up
with cowboys,

17:18.872 --> 17:22.166
but our dads were all
about this cowboy shit, right?

17:22.166 --> 17:26.088
Yep. Ireland was nothing
but cowboys and sheepdogs.

17:26.088 --> 17:28.632
I'd have to ask my dad,
but he moved back to Puerto Rico,

17:28.632 --> 17:29.883
and we don't talk.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.635
Wait, your dad wasn't Italian?

17:31.635 --> 17:34.304
- No, my stepdad's Italian.
- So you're not even Italian?

17:34.304 --> 17:36.473
You know why they called it the Wild West?

17:36.473 --> 17:40.143
Because back then, men took matters
of law and order into their own hands.

17:42.104 --> 17:43.647
Hey, what's this?

17:44.940 --> 17:48.735
That is how we used
to separate the men from the boys.

17:49.486 --> 17:51.405
This was in Johnson's back in the day.

17:52.281 --> 17:56.451
I was the only one to ever hit Burly Boy,
so Mr. Johnson let me bring it home.

17:57.035 --> 17:58.620
How does it work? Do you just punch it?

18:02.833 --> 18:04.126
That's my boy, Fucker!

18:04.126 --> 18:05.460
That was easy.

18:06.211 --> 18:09.339
Well, that's
'cause you're not doing it right, Tucker.

18:09.840 --> 18:12.050
Your form is off.
You have to punch it properly.

18:12.050 --> 18:15.262
You can't just cheat your way
through everything.

18:15.262 --> 18:16.346
Watch.

18:24.980 --> 18:26.815
If you're so tough,
why don't you give it a go?

18:26.815 --> 18:28.233
No. I wasn't laughing at you.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.027
It's just the thing,
it's so old-fashioned.

18:30.027 --> 18:33.197
I mean, come on,
punching a bag to prove you're a man?

18:33.197 --> 18:34.448
What are we, cavemen?

18:35.032 --> 18:37.784
Cavemen are responsible
for a lot of the things we have today.

18:37.784 --> 18:41.330
Check your history, Teach. The wheel...

18:43.123 --> 18:44.291
Weird hill to die on.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.793
Could you say that again, D?
I think I was distracted

18:46.793 --> 18:48.378
- by your giant vagina.
- What's going on?

18:48.378 --> 18:50.130
I don't know, but...

18:50.130 --> 18:52.132
I'm pretty sure your dad hates me.

18:52.132 --> 18:54.718
- What does that mean?
- ...cavewomen.

18:54.718 --> 18:56.678
- What? No, I don't. Get away--
- Shit.

18:56.678 --> 18:58.639
...your hand away from my vagi--
I don't have a vagina!

18:58.639 --> 18:59.598
I'm sorry.

18:59.598 --> 19:01.808
I can do it. If I wanted to do--
All right, I'll do it.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.185
Are you a little dinky? Or a--

19:03.185 --> 19:04.978
- I'm not a dinky!
- No?

19:08.065 --> 19:10.901
- Kapow!
- Hey, that's not bad.

19:10.901 --> 19:11.944
Get up! No.

19:11.944 --> 19:13.070
- Not bad, Big D.
- Big Boy!

19:13.070 --> 19:15.030
All right, you're up, superstar.

19:15.030 --> 19:17.282
Yeah, I would.
But your mom told me not to.

19:17.282 --> 19:19.201
- Okay, come on.
- Nah, I actually mean it.

19:19.201 --> 19:22.162
Your mom's my doctor. She said I should
be careful re-aggravating my injury.

19:22.162 --> 19:23.455
Okay.

19:23.455 --> 19:24.581
While we were fucking!

19:26.959 --> 19:28.502
- Got him!
- He fucked your mom?

19:28.502 --> 19:30.671
No, she called him cute once
when we were teenagers,

19:30.671 --> 19:32.256
- and now it's my whole life.
- Can I go?

19:32.256 --> 19:33.674
No, hold on, Axel.

19:33.674 --> 19:36.927
I wanna see Tuck go again.

19:37.511 --> 19:39.680
And no cheating this time.

19:39.680 --> 19:40.764
Okay.

19:42.099 --> 19:43.225
You got anything to eat?

19:44.059 --> 19:45.435
Yeah.

19:46.854 --> 19:47.980
Big strong boy!

19:52.985 --> 19:54.319
Okay. "Royalty.

19:54.319 --> 19:59.116
The most successful, famous or highly
regarded members of a particular group."

19:59.116 --> 20:01.326
- See?
- But it doesn't say anything about kings

20:01.326 --> 20:02.411
or queens or something?

20:02.411 --> 20:04.079
No, not in this part.

20:04.079 --> 20:08.292
I think it just means, like,
a person that everyone admires

20:08.292 --> 20:10.544
who leads the way.

20:10.544 --> 20:12.171
And that is who you are.

20:12.171 --> 20:15.090
And that is who you can be
to the people in this town.

20:15.090 --> 20:17.634
I mean, look. I literally wrote this down
when you were talking.

20:18.302 --> 20:20.220
"Deerfield's Diana."

20:20.220 --> 20:22.389
- The Diana?
- The Diana. Deerfield's Diana.

20:22.389 --> 20:23.849
Hello?

20:23.849 --> 20:26.268
- Oh, my God. Girls.
- Hey, Mom.

20:26.268 --> 20:27.394
- Hey, Nat.
- Hi.

20:27.394 --> 20:30.147
Hey.
We didn't know you two were back hanging.

20:30.147 --> 20:33.025
That's so nice.

20:33.025 --> 20:36.486
Hey, do you want me to make some nachos
with Totino's Pizza Rolls

20:36.486 --> 20:37.738
and pico de gallo?

20:38.614 --> 20:40.908
Yeah, I actually can't stay.

20:40.908 --> 20:43.535
I have this really big test
to study for tomorrow.

20:43.535 --> 20:45.370
So, can you drive me?

20:45.370 --> 20:46.288
Okay. But wait!

20:46.288 --> 20:49.249
Your mom was just coming up
with so many dope ideas,

20:49.249 --> 20:51.168
and I want to hear what you girls think.

20:51.168 --> 20:53.045
Trina,
what do you wanna be when you're older?

20:53.045 --> 20:56.673
I'm definitely gonna be unemployed
if I don't study for this test.

20:58.300 --> 20:59.510
Yes!

20:59.510 --> 21:01.512
Okay, so, then what about you, Savannah?

21:01.512 --> 21:03.305
Well, my card said "French."

21:03.305 --> 21:05.474
- Okay, that could be perfect. Right?
- Yes.

21:05.474 --> 21:06.975
Perfect for what?

21:06.975 --> 21:10.646
Well, Cass was thinking
about hosting a gala fundraiser

21:10.646 --> 21:14.149
to help the young people
in Deerfield reach their potential.

21:14.149 --> 21:16.026
And I'm gonna write about it
for the Digest.

21:16.026 --> 21:17.361
A gala?

21:17.361 --> 21:19.238
Or just a fundraiser.

21:19.238 --> 21:23.033
The idea is that we raise money so
that people like Savannah can go to France

21:23.033 --> 21:25.994
or learn French or do whatever it is
the French means to you!

21:25.994 --> 21:27.246
Ooh la la!

21:27.246 --> 21:29.373
I mean, I personally--
I would take the trip.

21:29.373 --> 21:32.251
I would go to France
because I studied abroad in Italy.

21:32.251 --> 21:34.545
- Best three months of my life. Yeah.
- Of her life. Yes.

21:35.963 --> 21:39.132
Aside from every month I've ever spent
with Trina.

21:39.800 --> 21:40.843
Amazing save.

21:42.761 --> 21:44.054
Since I got "Meteorologist,"

21:44.054 --> 21:47.057
my parents have been expecting me to
unleash some untapped genius or something.

21:47.724 --> 21:49.726
And since my stepbrother
Xander's a fucking burnout

21:49.726 --> 21:52.145
still working at Giorgio's,
I feel like I can't mess up.

21:52.145 --> 21:55.148
It's like all our parents are projecting
their midlife crises onto us.

21:55.148 --> 21:57.025
My dad just completely ignores me.

21:57.025 --> 21:59.570
Seems like the only thing he wants
to do is take pictures of trees

21:59.570 --> 22:01.363
and hang out with his girlfriend, Hawaii.

22:01.363 --> 22:03.907
Jake, I get why you
didn't want people to know you got "Hero."

22:03.907 --> 22:05.993
As if it's not enough pressure trying
to live up to Kolton.

22:05.993 --> 22:08.495
Man, and you're his twin.
It's like living for two people.

22:08.495 --> 22:09.413
Yeah.

22:09.413 --> 22:11.373
And your dad, he's...

22:11.373 --> 22:12.332
he's clearly not well.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.960
Kolton was the only one
good enough to play college ball.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.504
And now that we know
we don't have the potential--

22:18.046 --> 22:19.047
I mean, what's the point?

22:19.047 --> 22:20.966
Yeah,
but that's pressure too though, right?

22:20.966 --> 22:22.676
Like, everything has to have a point.

22:22.676 --> 22:24.344
You're told you're going to be something,

22:24.344 --> 22:27.139
now you gotta do this and do this
and do this and then that's your life.

22:27.139 --> 22:31.143
Exactly. That's what our parents did,
and just look at how fucking sad they are.

22:31.143 --> 22:33.604
I don't want to know
what I'm supposed to be.

22:33.604 --> 22:37.316
I just want to keep doing what I like
and what makes me happy, and--

22:37.316 --> 22:38.901
Shit, I don't know, maybe that's naive.

22:38.901 --> 22:42.988
That's privilege. Look, I agree,
but for some people,

22:42.988 --> 22:45.032
knowing what you're going
to be is a dream.

22:45.032 --> 22:48.744
Here we are, talking about our problems,
and Jake's going through so much worse.

22:48.744 --> 22:50.162
No, I get it.

22:50.996 --> 22:53.957
I mean, you feel, like,
entitled for wanting to be happy.

22:53.957 --> 22:55.209
Yeah.

22:55.209 --> 22:56.877
But also, we're in high school.

22:56.877 --> 22:59.755
Like,
things aren't supposed to be this hard.

23:00.714 --> 23:01.715
Cheers.

23:05.677 --> 23:07.137
All right, I got next.

23:09.806 --> 23:11.433
No!

23:12.100 --> 23:13.936
Think we should probably just call it,
Mr. Kovac.

23:13.936 --> 23:17.648
No way, man. This game is not over
until one of us hits Burly Boy.

23:17.648 --> 23:19.691
- Who wants a shot?
- Giorgio, come on.

23:19.691 --> 23:21.610
I can't have us drinking
around the students.

23:21.610 --> 23:24.780
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Dusty can't handle the spice.

23:25.864 --> 23:29.243
This is Cass's hot wings all over again.
Huh, little dinky?

23:38.335 --> 23:39.962
- Let's go!
- That's what I'm talking about!

23:39.962 --> 23:41.171
Make mine a double.

23:41.755 --> 23:43.006
Speaking of spice, D,

23:43.006 --> 23:45.759
I heard that you and Cass spent a night
at the Cruisin' Cruise Inn.

23:45.759 --> 23:48.595
- Where'd you hear that?
- I got a text from Coach Eagleson,

23:48.595 --> 23:51.807
and I was just concerned because he said
that he saw Cass crying in the hallway--

23:51.807 --> 23:53.767
Yeah, well maybe Coach Eagleson
shouldn't be gossiping

23:53.767 --> 23:56.019
about other people's relationships!
How about that?

23:56.019 --> 23:58.689
Take it easy, big man. Smile for me.

23:58.689 --> 24:01.024
- We're all good friends here.
- I'm smiling. I'm fine.

24:01.024 --> 24:02.276
Hey, have another drink.

24:02.276 --> 24:03.944
- Take that rage out on the machine.
- Okay.

24:03.944 --> 24:05.863
If you must,
you can rub Beau's head for good luck.

24:05.863 --> 24:07.531
Come on, man. Don't touch my hat.

24:07.531 --> 24:09.783
Take it easy, man.
Little dinky's thinning up top too.

24:10.576 --> 24:12.369
We can't all have these luscious locks

24:12.369 --> 24:14.788
that women just love
running their fingers through.

24:16.373 --> 24:18.917
Stop talking about your hair! Stop it!

24:18.917 --> 24:22.129
Stop talking about it!
Nobody wants to talk about your hair.

24:22.129 --> 24:24.631
Stupid, not-even-Italian, little--

24:24.631 --> 24:26.592
- Let's go!
- Yeah, hit it!

24:31.763 --> 24:32.723
I--

24:32.723 --> 24:35.976
I kinda feel like you think
my whole fundraiser idea is lame.

24:35.976 --> 24:37.477
I don't think it's lame.

24:37.477 --> 24:39.479
I just don't get why it has to be, like,

24:39.479 --> 24:41.648
this big event
with you at the center of it.

24:42.482 --> 24:45.777
I won't be at the center of it. Wha--

24:47.196 --> 24:50.157
And, like,
what if someone has a bad potential?

24:50.157 --> 24:51.700
They don't deserve your support?

24:52.409 --> 24:56.663
I don't know anybody with a bad potential.
Do you know somebody with a bad potential?

25:01.043 --> 25:02.461
Okay, hold on.

25:02.461 --> 25:04.838
<i>From Giorgio. Cassie, come to Beau's.</i>

25:04.838 --> 25:07.007
<i>Dusty is drunk,
and I don't think he should scooter home.</i>

25:07.007 --> 25:08.342
Okay. All right.

25:08.342 --> 25:12.054
<i>Bicycle emoji. Woozy face emoji.
Coffin emoji.</i>

25:15.182 --> 25:16.183
Let's go!

25:16.183 --> 25:17.267
Come on!

25:18.435 --> 25:20.395
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

25:31.615 --> 25:34.284
- Hey.
- Hey, did my dad see you?

25:34.284 --> 25:38.121
No, but my parents are outside,
so I only have a minute.

25:38.121 --> 25:39.248
Okay.

25:41.083 --> 25:43.585
I hate that you
and I are both really sad right now,

25:43.585 --> 25:46.713
and I hate feeling like maybe
you could be happier

25:46.713 --> 25:48.507
if you were dating literally anybody else.

25:48.507 --> 25:51.593
- Trina.
- But I can't think of any possible way

25:51.593 --> 25:54.429
that you and I could ever
have anything normal. Can you?

25:56.515 --> 25:58.100
Maybe by being together,

25:58.100 --> 26:00.185
you and I are just going
to keep reminding each other

26:00.185 --> 26:02.104
of this terrible thing we did,

26:02.104 --> 26:06.692
and you're always gonna feel like a fraud,
and I'm always just gonna be a liar.

26:06.692 --> 26:08.360
- That's not true.
- Really?

26:10.237 --> 26:14.449
Tell that to the machine and everyone
in town who believes everything it says.

26:19.872 --> 26:20.873
Okay.

26:22.332 --> 26:24.168
So, take one of these blank cards.

26:24.168 --> 26:26.837
I know you're trying
to do something nice right now,

26:26.837 --> 26:29.756
but you are basically telling me
I have zero potential.

26:31.466 --> 26:32.467
No.

26:36.263 --> 26:38.557
I'm saying you can be anything you want.

26:49.193 --> 26:52.529
- No! It's not working, man.
- I'm sorry I called ya.

26:52.529 --> 26:55.115
I was just worried about D, to be honest.

26:55.115 --> 26:57.618
Drinking in front of his students.

26:57.618 --> 27:00.871
Hey, Cass. I ju--
No, I'm ready to hit the road.

27:00.871 --> 27:02.706
Unless you want a little drink
before we go?

27:02.706 --> 27:04.708
- No.
- No, you're in a different mood.

27:04.708 --> 27:06.960
All right, well,
I'm just gonna-- I'll be in the car.

27:06.960 --> 27:08.337
You do that.

27:08.337 --> 27:11.089
- Where's my scooter?
- I'm worried about him too.

27:12.841 --> 27:14.176
But I just can't right now.

27:14.176 --> 27:16.637
I have too much else going on.
Actually, I'm--

27:17.179 --> 27:20.641
I'm putting together this gala fundraiser,
or "potential" fundraiser,

27:21.141 --> 27:24.686
and I was thinking
that if I needed a venue...

27:24.686 --> 27:26.772
Yes. Absolutely. Yes. The answer's yes.

27:26.772 --> 27:28.607
- Of course, you can use Giorgio's.
- Yeah?

27:28.607 --> 27:30.776
And Cass, from this moment on,

27:30.776 --> 27:35.280
it is no longer a potential fundraiser.
It is a gala.

27:38.492 --> 27:41.119
That's what I thought!

27:44.915 --> 27:46.875
I know what you did, Fucker.

27:46.875 --> 27:48.710
I'm sorry! I'll fix it, I promise!

27:48.710 --> 27:50.629
- Fix what?
- The table!

27:51.505 --> 27:52.756
This.

28:08.146 --> 28:09.857
Never mind, Tucker. Go home.

28:11.567 --> 28:12.568
Okay.

28:44.266 --> 28:45.642
It was you, wasn't it?

28:49.188 --> 28:50.189
It's over now.

29:13.545 --> 29:15.964
So much for setting a positive example.
