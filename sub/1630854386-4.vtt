- Oh, he'd definitely
be the right guy.

16:39.698 --> 16:41.800
I bet he'd even be willing
to babysit the kids.

16:41.867 --> 16:44.103
- And he was in "Star Wars,"
so he

16:44.169 --> 16:45.637
can talk about space with you.

16:45.704 --> 16:47.039
- I don't think it should
be called babysitting

16:47.106 --> 16:48.741
if it's your own children.

16:48.807 --> 16:52.177
- Hey, hey, guys, please show
Officer Lane some respect.

16:52.244 --> 16:54.179
She's at the top of
her field,

16:54.246 --> 16:56.949
and that can be intimidating
to guys trying to smash.

16:57.015 --> 16:59.418
[together]
Ohh.

16:59.485 --> 17:01.320
- It all makes sense
when you think about it.

17:01.387 --> 17:02.287
It's just so sad.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.757
- What?
No. Feel sad?

17:04.823 --> 17:06.725
Why?
My life is great.

17:06.792 --> 17:09.495
All right?
I-- I teach at MIT.

17:09.561 --> 17:10.863
I fly F-16s.

17:10.929 --> 17:12.965
I just went
to fucking space, OK?

17:13.031 --> 17:14.466
The thing beyond the sky?

17:14.533 --> 17:16.101
I have a great life!
I want this!

17:16.168 --> 17:17.002
- Ma'am.

17:17.069 --> 17:17.936
- This is the life I want!

17:18.003 --> 17:18.971
Oh my god!

17:19.037 --> 17:20.339
- We're the space police.

17:20.406 --> 17:21.740
You're in violation
of space law.

17:21.807 --> 17:22.875
You need to go with us.
- Why?

17:22.941 --> 17:24.176
Because I don't want children?

17:24.243 --> 17:26.745
- No, for vehicular
manslaughter.

17:26.812 --> 17:29.214
- Oh, yeah.

17:29.281 --> 17:32.151
- This scene started
as two different ideas.

17:32.217 --> 17:34.052
Jeremy pitched
a female astronaut

17:34.119 --> 17:36.121
not being taken
seriously, and Georgie

17:36.188 --> 17:38.223
pitched a woman
that doesn't want kids

17:38.290 --> 17:39.558
who's treated like a criminal.

17:39.625 --> 17:42.294
- Amy suggested we
merge the two ideas.

17:42.361 --> 17:44.563
So I guess you can say
Jeremy and I are the parents

17:44.630 --> 17:47.132
of this scene, and no one
needs to ask me when I'm

17:47.199 --> 17:48.567
going to have kids anymore.

17:48.634 --> 17:50.669
- I don't care for children.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.639
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

17:53.705 --> 17:54.673
- Hi.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.742
I'm activist Amy Schumer.

17:56.809 --> 17:58.110
If you're anything like me,

17:58.177 --> 18:00.446
you're a dedicated liberal
and working mother.

18:00.512 --> 18:02.381
When I started
looking at preschools,

18:02.448 --> 18:04.783
<i>I heard a lot of like-minded</i>
<i>parents wanting to explore</i>

18:04.850 --> 18:06.385
<i>a progressive curriculum.</i>

18:06.452 --> 18:08.987
Many parents wanted to
address critical race theory,

18:09.054 --> 18:11.223
because they heard it was good.

18:11.290 --> 18:12.758
<i>School directors said</i>
<i>it refers</i>

18:12.825 --> 18:14.159
<i>to some advanced theories</i>

18:14.226 --> 18:16.695
about systematic racism
and that kind of stuff.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.331
<i>And most developmental experts</i>
<i>think we should teach children</i>

18:19.398 --> 18:21.200
<i>in ways that are consistent</i>

18:21.266 --> 18:23.035
<i>with their intellectual</i>
<i>capacities.</i>

18:23.101 --> 18:25.304
But I say that's a cop-out.

18:25.370 --> 18:28.240
No age is too young to face
the brutal unabridged truth

18:28.307 --> 18:30.542
about the white supremacy
we live in.

18:30.609 --> 18:33.312
That's why I founded my own
preschool, Amy's Garden,

18:33.378 --> 18:36.515
<i>a critical race theory garden.</i>

18:36.582 --> 18:39.284
<i>Our infant room begins</i>
<i>at six days old.</i>

18:39.351 --> 18:42.821
Newborns learn where their
hands are and the entirety

18:42.888 --> 18:44.990
<i>of Isabel Wilkerson's "Caste."</i>

18:45.057 --> 18:47.659
At Amy's Garden,
we employ infant sign language

18:47.726 --> 18:51.530
to communicate such important
concepts as "more," "milk,"

18:51.597 --> 18:54.833
and "Reconstruction and the
rise of the Jim Crow South."

18:54.900 --> 18:57.836
<i>In the toddler room, little</i>
<i>ones choose such activities</i>

18:57.903 --> 18:59.571
<i>as playing farmers' market,</i>

18:59.638 --> 19:02.541
<i>learning ABCs,</i>
<i>and a simulation</i>

19:02.608 --> 19:05.611
<i>of hiding under a table</i>
<i>in Nazi Germany.</i>

19:05.677 --> 19:08.280
Field trips are arranged
to visit such locations

19:08.347 --> 19:11.850
as the Holocaust Museum,
Yad Vashem in Jerusalem,

19:11.917 --> 19:16.355
and complex sociological
lectures at the 92nd Street Y.

19:16.421 --> 19:20.292
- Open your eyes
to the realities, Gus.

19:20.359 --> 19:23.295
- And Amy's Garden
is an amazing community.

19:23.362 --> 19:25.731
You're going to meet
all kinds of parents--

19:25.797 --> 19:29.635
<i>people in finance, people in</i>
<i>the arts married to people</i>

19:29.701 --> 19:32.671
<i>in finance, people in finance</i>
<i>married to other people</i>

19:32.738 --> 19:35.007
<i>also in finance,</i>
<i>and a Black couple</i>

19:35.073 --> 19:36.408
<i>married to each</i>
<i>other in finance,</i>

19:36.475 --> 19:40.512
<i>and obviously, Audra McDonald.</i>

19:40.579 --> 19:42.314
If this sounds like
something for you,

19:42.381 --> 19:44.416
get your application
in ASAP,

19:44.483 --> 19:46.785
because with six slots,
it's basically impossible

19:46.852 --> 19:49.421
to get in, unless you're part
of my general social circle,

19:49.488 --> 19:50.856
in which case, it's very easy,

19:50.923 --> 19:52.424
unless I'm mad
at you that week.

19:52.491 --> 19:55.327
Amy's Garden-- this country
was meant for everyone.

19:55.394 --> 19:57.229
Let's start living that way.

19:57.296 --> 19:59.698
<i>Tuition $50,000</i>

19:59.765 --> 20:02.601
<i>does not include</i>
<i>blocks or snacks.</i>

20:02.668 --> 20:04.770
This one was tricky,
and we talked about it a lot

20:04.836 --> 20:06.204
in the writers' room.

20:06.271 --> 20:07.906
We didn't want it
to be taken the wrong way.

20:07.973 --> 20:09.174
- Yeah.
Before you go to Twitter,

20:09.241 --> 20:10.976
just know the staff
is uniformly

20:11.043 --> 20:12.778
in favor of social justice.

20:12.844 --> 20:15.113
- But sometimes you need to
make fun of rich white people

20:15.180 --> 20:17.082
who are taking it too far.
