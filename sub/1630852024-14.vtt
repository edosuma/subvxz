WEBVTT

00:02.306 --> 00:04.178
[Jughead] How many times
have you wondered?

00:04.221 --> 00:08.095
If you could have
any superpower,
what would it be?

00:08.138 --> 00:13.491
Because, of course, no one
ever thinks about the downside
to having superpowers.

00:19.976 --> 00:22.631
The piercing headaches
and blind spots.

00:25.416 --> 00:26.852
The kisses of death.

00:31.205 --> 00:34.773
The strange, debilitating
vulnerabilities you develop.

00:34.817 --> 00:37.080
What the hell are you
doing now, Percival?

00:37.124 --> 00:39.213
And Reggie, are you serious?

00:39.256 --> 00:42.216
You do realize he's using
his Jedi mind tricks
to control you, right?

00:42.259 --> 00:45.958
I know you think I'm an idiot,
Archie, but the Mayor's
taking us places.

00:46.002 --> 00:48.787
Especially after I build
my new railroad,
which will take a route

00:48.831 --> 00:52.617
directly through this quaint
but woefully outdated diner.

00:52.661 --> 00:55.620
You are not tearing down
Pop's, okay.

00:55.664 --> 00:57.448
You'll have to go
through me first.

00:57.492 --> 01:00.277
Classic American bravado.

01:00.321 --> 01:02.192
Tell me, have you seen
my new ring?

01:03.237 --> 01:04.542
Pure palladium.

01:04.586 --> 01:06.588
Don't make me beat you up
again, Archie, I...

01:06.631 --> 01:10.809
I doubt your body or your
bruised ego can survive
another encounter with me.

01:10.853 --> 01:12.028
Future's coming.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.857
Best not to be a penny
on the tracks, eh?

01:14.900 --> 01:19.557
Oh, Nana, I'm debating
consulting the spirits
for guidance.

01:19.601 --> 01:24.649
Given recent events,
my mind has turned
to the past.

01:24.693 --> 01:28.392
-Namely, my junior high
sweetheart, Heather.
-Oh!

01:29.306 --> 01:31.134
The lost love.

01:31.178 --> 01:33.310
I stalked her on social.

01:33.354 --> 01:38.750
She's a librarian
and she lives in Greendale,
which is not that far.

01:40.404 --> 01:44.452
I can't help but thinking
maybe our story
isn't finished.

01:44.495 --> 01:48.151
Well, if you ask me,
what's done is done.

01:48.195 --> 01:50.153
Heather's gone. Let her be.

01:50.197 --> 01:53.678
Oh, Sphere of Knowledge,
should I call Heather?

02:00.120 --> 02:00.946
Fine.

02:03.253 --> 02:04.341
In that case...

02:06.387 --> 02:07.257
maybe an email.

02:09.520 --> 02:10.695
That's good, right?

02:11.348 --> 02:12.610
No presh.

02:13.698 --> 02:15.918
Any luck with Tabitha
in Albany?

02:15.961 --> 02:17.963
Nah, she's hitting
some dead ends.

02:18.007 --> 02:19.008
It's not looking so good.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.665
Jeez, can we not get
one win on this guy?

02:23.708 --> 02:25.188
I mean, he stole the mayorship.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.364
He's coming after our friends,
our family.

02:27.408 --> 02:28.322
It's like we're...

02:29.497 --> 02:31.238
playing constant defense.

02:31.281 --> 02:33.153
Oh, God, if you're going
to start using
sports metaphors,

02:33.196 --> 02:34.763
then I'm going to start
using comic ones.

02:34.806 --> 02:36.852
I didn't even know you were
that into comics.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.246
What can I say?

02:39.289 --> 02:40.725
I contain multitudes.

02:40.769 --> 02:43.424
Well, what can I say, Archie,
I contain multitudes.

02:43.467 --> 02:45.948
I asked my mom for
all these old comics
from Toledo.

02:45.991 --> 02:48.429
After that stuff
with my grandpa
only writing one book,

02:48.472 --> 02:52.259
I thought it would be good
for me to go back into
creative writing,

02:52.302 --> 02:53.738
like comics or graphic novels.

02:53.782 --> 02:56.001
How did Superman do it?
How did he beat Kryptonite?

02:56.045 --> 02:59.222
Well, if I'm remembering
my Kryptonian lore correctly,

02:59.266 --> 03:03.444
there's an old comic where
Supes just built up an immunity
to it by exposing himself.

03:03.487 --> 03:06.229
You know, come to think of it,
Mighty Mouse did
the same thing.

03:06.273 --> 03:08.318
What was Mighty Mouse's
weakness?

03:08.362 --> 03:09.363
Limburg cheese.

03:09.406 --> 03:11.234
[chuckles]

03:11.278 --> 03:13.323
I mean, it's not exactly
hard science that we're
talking about here.

03:13.367 --> 03:15.456
Well, nothing has been
scientific since
that explosion.

03:15.499 --> 03:17.632
And Cheryl might still
have some palladium.

03:19.721 --> 03:23.159
Talk to me, Doctor,
what's your diagnosis?

03:23.203 --> 03:27.859
Your body seems to be
generating enormous
amounts of toxins.

03:27.903 --> 03:31.036
And it's not just from
the saliva on your lips.

03:32.037 --> 03:33.778
It's in your tears,

03:33.822 --> 03:37.260
in your blood,
in your perspiration.

03:37.304 --> 03:40.524
I'm actually not sure how
you haven't died yet.

03:40.568 --> 03:43.353
So what do we do?

03:43.397 --> 03:48.184
I'm going to suggest
a strict regimen of dialysis
to detoxify your body.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.403
Wait, dialysis?

03:50.447 --> 03:52.493
But I don't even feel sick.

03:52.536 --> 03:56.584
We need to lower the amount
of poison in your body,
Miss Lodge.

03:56.627 --> 04:00.152
And until we do,
I think that you
should avoid

04:00.196 --> 04:05.375
any and all physical contact
with any person or persons.

04:06.507 --> 04:08.073
[Betty] I need your help, Jug.

04:08.117 --> 04:10.424
-What's up?
-[Betty] Can you...

04:10.467 --> 04:12.164
Will you read my mind?

04:13.340 --> 04:16.081
This sounds like a trap.

04:16.125 --> 04:20.216
Not my conscious mind,
my subconscious mind.

04:20.260 --> 04:24.307
I need you to go deep
into memories that
I may have repressed.

04:24.351 --> 04:29.356
First off, I don't even know
if this is something
I'm capable of.

04:29.399 --> 04:30.400
No, I know.

04:31.314 --> 04:33.490
I know. A lot of...

04:33.534 --> 04:37.059
TBK stuff resurfaced
for me during the fog.

04:37.102 --> 04:39.322
And then Percival's
damn library books

04:39.366 --> 04:42.325
brought up things from my past
about my dad and...

04:43.587 --> 04:45.110
I just feel like
an open wound.

04:45.154 --> 04:49.463
A reopened wound,
and I'm trying to
stitch myself...

04:49.506 --> 04:51.682
back together, but I need
the missing pieces.

04:51.726 --> 04:56.252
The things that my memory
is suppressing and I can't
get to them on my own.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.385
So, please, Jug.

04:58.428 --> 05:00.256
Okay.

05:00.300 --> 05:06.306
Yeah. Okay. I'll do
some research on
deep mind reading.

05:06.349 --> 05:09.526
'Tis only fitting, since you
were the one who dug it
up from my mines.

05:13.269 --> 05:14.792
Thank you, Cheryl.

05:14.836 --> 05:16.228
I'll get it back to you ASAP.

05:16.794 --> 05:18.796
No rush.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.756
But, Archie, you do realize
you are playing with forces

05:21.799 --> 05:25.107
far beyond your understanding
or the natural world?

05:25.150 --> 05:27.022
You don't know where
your powers come from

05:27.065 --> 05:30.373
or why palladium specifically
weakens you and not the others.

05:30.417 --> 05:33.376
Are you certain chasing
immunity is worth the risk
this aura poses you?

05:33.420 --> 05:36.379
Percival hasn't left me with
many options, Cheryl.

05:36.423 --> 05:41.341
True, but unlike you,
I do have experience
in the supernatural.

05:41.384 --> 05:44.692
Perhaps I can divine
a pathway through
this for you?

05:44.735 --> 05:46.433
Without it costing you
your life.

06:18.552 --> 06:19.422
[grunting]

06:41.444 --> 06:42.706
[intercom beeping]

06:44.142 --> 06:45.622
Yes, Jay?

06:45.666 --> 06:47.624
[Jay] I'm sorry to bother you,
Miss Lodge,

06:47.668 --> 06:49.191
but Mr. Shipley just left
another message
saying that--

06:49.234 --> 06:51.149
I don't care how many
prime investors call.

06:51.193 --> 06:53.587
We're pushing
the shareholders meeting.

06:53.630 --> 06:57.025
I told Mr. Shipley that
and he said they're
holding a sit down meeting,

06:57.068 --> 06:59.288
with or without you,
at the casino.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.378
Fine. It's their funeral.

07:08.384 --> 07:10.342
Nana, have you seen
my book on Rasputin?

07:10.386 --> 07:13.824
Oh, yes, I was reading
it the other night.

07:13.868 --> 07:16.218
Okay. Well, can
I have it back?

07:16.261 --> 07:17.480
I'm doing some research,

07:17.524 --> 07:18.873
and it may contain
some esoteric information

07:18.916 --> 07:19.917
to help poor Archie.

07:19.961 --> 07:21.658
Or is it merely to distract

07:21.702 --> 07:22.833
yourself from the fact

07:22.877 --> 07:25.270
that Heather hasn't responded

07:25.314 --> 07:27.403
to your email yet?

07:27.447 --> 07:29.623
Well, she hasn't, has she?

07:29.666 --> 07:31.102
No, sadly.

07:31.146 --> 07:32.408
In my experience,

07:32.452 --> 07:33.627
people usually respond

07:33.670 --> 07:35.716
promptly to emails...

07:36.543 --> 07:38.501
when they care.

07:38.545 --> 07:42.679
In your experience, people also
communicated by pigeon.

07:42.723 --> 07:45.465
Now get my Russian tome,
you Baba Yaga.

07:50.252 --> 07:53.124
Hey, I'm gonna go
meet up with Jughead.

07:54.691 --> 07:56.084
Are you okay?

07:56.127 --> 07:58.086
Yeah, totally.

07:58.129 --> 08:01.481
Before you leave,
could you open
this can for me?

08:01.524 --> 08:04.614
Sure. Why... why do you
need my help?

08:07.704 --> 08:12.056
Oh, my God, Archie,
were you punching
a brick wall?

08:12.100 --> 08:14.537
You are going to break
every bone in your body.

08:14.581 --> 08:15.930
That's just it, Betty,

08:16.800 --> 08:18.976
it was a regular workout.

08:19.020 --> 08:23.024
Even before I was invulnerable,
I would tear into that bag
and it was no problem.

08:23.067 --> 08:24.547
This time I felt like
I was punching nails.

08:24.591 --> 08:27.289
Because you're wearing
that stupid rock.

08:27.332 --> 08:29.552
Stop this crazy regimen
that you're on.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.598
I can't, Betty.

08:31.641 --> 08:33.861
I can't be weak
in the face of Percival.

08:41.651 --> 08:43.479
Sorry I'm late, boys.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.047
Had to make myself
presentable for such VIPs.

08:46.090 --> 08:48.615
[scoffs] Veronica,
is that you?

08:48.658 --> 08:50.747
Yes, it is, Reginald.

08:50.791 --> 08:54.534
Can't believe you're here,
though, considering
I banished your ass.

08:54.577 --> 08:57.580
As for my appearance,
I was feeling
rather germophobic,

08:57.624 --> 09:01.802
but since you all insisted
on meeting in person,
well, here I am.

09:01.845 --> 09:06.763
Good, because we,
as shareholders,
and don't forget,

09:06.807 --> 09:08.591
I'm also co-founder.

09:08.635 --> 09:12.029
We have a lot of concerns
about what's happening
at the Babylonium.

09:12.073 --> 09:14.771
Hmm. What are these concerns?

09:14.815 --> 09:19.297
For starters,
we're questioning your
decision to remove me

09:19.341 --> 09:21.778
from the casino's
day-to-day operations.

09:21.822 --> 09:25.565
-Oh, well, if that's
your biggest worry--
-It's not.

09:25.608 --> 09:27.697
There's also the fact
that no one in this room

09:27.741 --> 09:29.525
sees a return on
their investments

09:29.569 --> 09:31.832
until the casino starts
turning a profit

09:31.875 --> 09:35.313
and there hasn't been one week
under your leadership

09:35.357 --> 09:37.838
that the Babylonium's
been in the black.

09:37.881 --> 09:40.275
[sighs] Is that all?

09:40.318 --> 09:41.624
It was.

09:41.668 --> 09:46.673
But I also have to add
you look insane right now.

09:46.716 --> 09:49.414
Nice, Reggie.

09:49.458 --> 09:54.724
Gentleman, clearly
my former colleague
has been stirring the pot.

09:54.768 --> 09:58.685
But need I remind you,
when we opened
the Babylonium,

09:58.728 --> 10:01.992
we all knew that the first year
would be the most difficult.

10:02.036 --> 10:05.430
Yet every week we move
toward profitability.

10:05.474 --> 10:08.782
Nevertheless, we found
a buyer for the casino.

10:08.825 --> 10:11.785
If we sell now,
we get our money back.

10:11.828 --> 10:13.700
Plus a little extra.

10:13.743 --> 10:17.660
Selling now would be
a colossal mistake.

10:17.704 --> 10:20.663
Woefully shortsighted.

10:20.707 --> 10:25.146
Give me a few days
to put together a new
company valuation,

10:25.189 --> 10:28.453
so you can see exactly what
you'd be walking away from.

10:32.370 --> 10:36.548
So I did a deep dive
on memory reading,
meditation,

10:36.592 --> 10:38.899
hypnotherapy,
guided visualization.

10:38.942 --> 10:40.944
They all circle the same
ideas, right?

10:40.988 --> 10:43.338
I think we can apply
these principles to my gift,

10:43.381 --> 10:45.166
or power.

10:45.209 --> 10:46.733
Okay, great. What do I do?

10:46.776 --> 10:49.736
You're going to need to
think of your memories

10:49.779 --> 10:50.737
as something visual.

10:51.694 --> 10:53.696
I recommend a, um...

10:53.740 --> 10:55.219
a series of comic books.

10:55.263 --> 10:58.527
Then your mind will organize
these free-floating memories

10:58.570 --> 10:59.920
into a collection.

10:59.963 --> 11:01.748
And your subconscious mind
will do the same

11:01.791 --> 11:03.184
with your repressed memories,

11:03.227 --> 11:05.447
which I can then access
or read.

11:05.490 --> 11:06.840
Okay.

11:06.883 --> 11:07.754
[inhaling deeply]

11:07.797 --> 11:08.885
Deep breaths.

11:10.844 --> 11:11.845
Relax.

11:11.888 --> 11:13.498
[exhaling deeply]

11:15.065 --> 11:16.676
Establish physical contact.

11:20.549 --> 11:21.463
Let's go digging.

11:31.342 --> 11:33.083
[light crackling]

11:57.978 --> 11:58.848
[Jughead] Nurse off duty?

11:58.892 --> 12:00.937
Holy crap.

12:00.981 --> 12:03.810
You haven't gone full
Yellow Wallpaper
on me yet, have you?

12:04.854 --> 12:05.768
[sighs]

12:06.813 --> 12:07.727
They're crazy.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.381
My parents are crazy.

12:10.425 --> 12:13.167
And now all I can think is,
maybe I'm crazy like they are.

12:13.210 --> 12:14.995
-[Jughead] Hey.
-[sighing]

12:15.038 --> 12:16.692
We're not our parents, Betty.

12:17.998 --> 12:18.955
Also...

12:20.914 --> 12:21.828
What?

12:23.003 --> 12:24.134
[Betty] Finding anything?

12:27.181 --> 12:29.096
Uh... just surface stuff.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.141
Let me keep digging.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.759
[thunder rumbling]

12:52.423 --> 12:53.381
[Betty] Jug?

12:54.556 --> 12:57.385
Do you think evil
can be passed on?

12:57.428 --> 13:00.040
What if it's my destiny,
my birthright,

13:00.083 --> 13:02.825
something I'll never be able
to control or understand?

13:02.869 --> 13:04.522
Hey, look at me.

13:06.002 --> 13:07.308
I know you.

13:07.351 --> 13:08.265
[sighing]

13:10.920 --> 13:12.922
You're a good person, Betty.

13:12.966 --> 13:14.576
You might have some darkness.

13:16.230 --> 13:17.361
But you're not evil.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.104
[Betty] Still just
shared memories?

13:21.148 --> 13:22.714
Yeah, so far.

13:22.758 --> 13:25.326
I think you're gonna need
to go even deeper, Jug.

13:32.986 --> 13:34.901
[thunderclap]

13:34.944 --> 13:36.380
[cat yowling]

13:39.166 --> 13:42.125
Daddy, did I do a bad thing?

13:42.169 --> 13:48.828
No, sweetie. No, it was Caramel
who did a bad thing

13:48.871 --> 13:50.046
by trying to run away.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.918
That's why she was
hit by that car.

13:53.049 --> 13:56.096
She was a sinner, Betty,

13:56.139 --> 13:58.185
and sinners need
to be punished.

13:58.968 --> 14:00.709
Tell me...

14:00.752 --> 14:03.886
how did it feel when
you brought that
rock down on her?

14:04.844 --> 14:06.149
Bad.

14:06.193 --> 14:08.238
But was there also, maybe...

14:09.718 --> 14:10.893
some excitement?

14:11.894 --> 14:12.808
[Betty] Oh, my God.

14:14.201 --> 14:15.463
He was grooming me.

14:17.030 --> 14:18.988
My dad was grooming me
to be a killer.

14:19.032 --> 14:21.208
It's no wonder you repressed
that memory. I would have too.

14:21.251 --> 14:25.081
You have to keep sifting
through my mind, Jug.

14:25.125 --> 14:26.953
I've lived with darkness
my whole life,

14:26.996 --> 14:28.824
but where did it start?

14:28.868 --> 14:29.781
Okay.

14:31.087 --> 14:33.394
But first we take a break.
Both of us.

14:36.658 --> 14:40.314
Merciful Gaea, you look like
death warmed over, Archie.

14:40.357 --> 14:41.924
It's the palladium.

14:41.968 --> 14:43.404
I knew something like this
was going to happen.

14:43.447 --> 14:45.667
You're an amateur
trafficking the arcane arts.

14:45.710 --> 14:47.974
-I have to--
-Build up an immunity
to it, yes,

14:48.017 --> 14:50.063
and you will, the right way.

14:50.106 --> 14:53.066
With some of my yummy
palladium soup.

14:53.109 --> 14:58.158
The raw ore is too intense
for you. You have to titrate
your exposure, Archie.

14:58.201 --> 15:00.421
Like the Russian mystic
Rasputin did.

15:00.464 --> 15:03.467
He ingested small amounts
of diluted poison over time
to build up a resistance to it.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.469
[sighing] And it worked
for this Russian guy?

15:05.513 --> 15:08.255
Absolutely, he became
almost impossible to kill.

15:08.298 --> 15:09.604
They had to drown him
in the end.

15:13.651 --> 15:15.566
Reggie, what the hell
was that ambush?

15:15.610 --> 15:17.307
Oh, seems we could ask
you the same thing.

15:17.351 --> 15:19.005
There really should be rules.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.964
Feel free to move out
anytime you want, Percival.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.619
But back to you, Reggie.

15:24.662 --> 15:27.013
I had a feeling you might be
in cahoots with this charlatan.

15:27.056 --> 15:29.929
Did he put you up to this
whole misguided play?

15:29.972 --> 15:30.886
There you go again.

15:33.106 --> 15:35.108
You can't imagine me
doing something,

15:35.151 --> 15:37.849
anything for myself,
can you?

15:37.893 --> 15:38.807
But guess what?

15:39.634 --> 15:41.505
This is all me.

15:42.115 --> 15:43.943
I called the meeting.

15:43.986 --> 15:48.034
I rallied the shareholders
and I lined up the buyer.

15:48.077 --> 15:49.209
Why?

15:49.252 --> 15:50.993
Because we broke up?

15:51.037 --> 15:51.994
[scoffs]

15:52.038 --> 15:54.562
What is the matter with you?

15:54.605 --> 15:58.218
How low is your
self-esteem, seriously?

15:58.261 --> 16:01.047
You're a 6'2,
200-pound jellyfish.

16:01.090 --> 16:05.529
I sincerely, legitimately,
truly believe you should
have your head X-rayed

16:05.573 --> 16:10.317
because I guarantee you,
there is Swiss cheese where
your brain is supposed to be.

16:10.360 --> 16:13.146
You ignorant, insecure,
petty...

16:16.062 --> 16:16.932
Oh, my God.

16:21.197 --> 16:22.459
[door closing]

16:22.503 --> 16:23.721
What the hell was that?

16:39.824 --> 16:41.000
[crowd cheering]

16:46.092 --> 16:47.832
[high-pitched ringing]

16:54.578 --> 16:58.278
I don't think the dialysis
is working, Dr. Curdle.

16:58.321 --> 17:00.193
I'm giving people nosebleeds.

17:00.236 --> 17:02.282
Indeed.

17:02.325 --> 17:06.286
Your latest toxicology panel
reveals the toxins in your body
have increased,

17:06.329 --> 17:07.591
not decreased.

17:07.635 --> 17:10.246
Okay, so what are
my other options?

17:10.290 --> 17:14.903
The barbarians are at the gate,
and the last thing I need
is to start showing signs

17:14.946 --> 17:16.513
of weakness or sickness.

17:16.557 --> 17:18.863
To be honest, Miss Lodge...

17:18.907 --> 17:21.388
I don't see how this ends
other than with you

17:21.431 --> 17:25.087
succumbing to the very toxins
your body is producing.

17:25.131 --> 17:26.480
[scoffs]

17:26.523 --> 17:27.524
I see.

17:29.135 --> 17:32.790
Sounds an awful lot
like a death sentence,
Dr. Curdle.

17:32.834 --> 17:34.792
I'm deeply sorry.

17:40.189 --> 17:43.279
Oh, trusted oracle,
still no email from Heather.

17:43.323 --> 17:44.367
Should I call her?

17:52.158 --> 17:53.246
Screw it.

18:10.611 --> 18:14.310
Greendale Public Library,
this is Heather speaking.
How may I assist you?

18:21.143 --> 18:21.970
[sighing]

18:36.985 --> 18:37.899
One thirty-five.

18:42.469 --> 18:46.212
I haven't weighed 135
since junior high.

18:46.255 --> 18:50.999
Ready for round two of
"So my dad's a serial killer
and tried to make me one too?"

18:51.042 --> 18:56.004
I honestly have no idea
what the criteria is
for "ready" here, so...

19:17.460 --> 19:19.288
[Alice]
I don't understand.

19:19.332 --> 19:24.554
These tests you made us get,
it says I have an MAOA
gene mutation?

19:24.598 --> 19:26.208
What does that even mean?

19:26.252 --> 19:29.646
That means you're special,
Alice, you're strong.

19:29.690 --> 19:33.041
The MAOA is the warrior gene.

19:33.084 --> 19:34.869
The serial killer gene.

19:34.912 --> 19:36.087
What?

19:36.131 --> 19:38.612
No, no, honey,
that is a wonderful thing.

19:38.655 --> 19:41.441
That means that maybe
one of the kids has it.

19:41.484 --> 19:42.311
Betty.

19:43.225 --> 19:44.313
I'll bet Betty has it.

19:44.357 --> 19:46.881
[Alice] And you're
excited about this?

19:46.924 --> 19:51.538
Oh, my God, Jug,
my mom is worse
than my dad.

19:51.581 --> 19:55.324
'Cause she's been lying to me
for my entire life

19:55.368 --> 19:57.021
to cover up what?

19:57.065 --> 19:59.198
That she has the gene?

19:59.241 --> 20:01.852
God! What if that's not
even the worst of it?

20:01.896 --> 20:03.027
[phone ringing]

20:06.553 --> 20:08.598
Hey. Hi, Vee.

20:08.642 --> 20:11.035
[Veronica] Hey, Bee.

20:11.079 --> 20:17.390
I got some rough news today
and I was wondering if you were
around for a drink or several?

20:17.433 --> 20:20.958
[Betty sighing] Same.
Yeah, I can meet you
at the Whyte Wyrm

20:21.002 --> 20:22.482
in, like, 30?

20:22.525 --> 20:23.439
You're an angel.

He ain't no forgiver ♪

20:28.705 --> 20:31.404

It's about to go ♪

20:49.160 --> 20:51.424
[sighing]

20:51.467 --> 20:54.383
Remember in high school when
I sponsored that kissing booth?

20:54.427 --> 20:58.257
-Mmm.
-Well, now I'm cursed
with the kiss of death.

20:58.300 --> 21:02.304
-Mmm.
-Welcome to the sad
superhero club, Ronnie.

21:02.348 --> 21:06.787
Thank you for risking
cocktail hour with
the Spider Woman.

21:06.830 --> 21:09.964
Of course, Vee, and we're not
in any danger from you.

21:10.007 --> 21:10.921
You would have...

21:11.748 --> 21:12.706
an aura.

21:13.533 --> 21:14.534
[sighs]

21:16.013 --> 21:16.971
Still...

21:18.233 --> 21:20.757
Sounds like we're all
having a time of it.

21:20.801 --> 21:23.369
Yeah, I mean, that's why
I stopped micro-dosing

21:23.412 --> 21:24.935
Cheryl's palladium soup.

21:24.979 --> 21:27.329
I was losing strength, density.

21:27.373 --> 21:31.028
All this means is that
we have to find another way
to beat Percival.

21:31.072 --> 21:35.555
And I suppose we have
Pickens the Perverse
to thank for our...

21:35.598 --> 21:37.557
respective afflictions.

21:37.600 --> 21:40.342
We're not sure, Vee,
because our powers
started manifesting

21:40.386 --> 21:42.039
before he got to town.

21:42.083 --> 21:45.608
We think the explosion in
my bedroom triggered
our powers.

21:45.652 --> 21:47.567
Not that it matters much.

21:47.610 --> 21:50.526
The bottom line is I'm screwed.

21:50.570 --> 21:52.354
I mean, I'm literally toxic.

21:52.398 --> 21:56.445
If I touch someone
or spit on them
or cry on them,

21:56.489 --> 21:58.360
they die.

21:58.404 --> 22:02.016
And to add insult to injury,
I'm facing a hostile takeover
at work

22:02.059 --> 22:04.366
while dealing with this
acute health crisis.

22:04.410 --> 22:09.545
And the worst part of all
of this is that my last
non-lethal kiss

22:09.589 --> 22:13.027
before Heraldo's death
was with backstabbing
Reggie Mantle,

22:13.070 --> 22:19.120
and now, for as long as I live,
that's going to be my last
meaningful human contact.

22:20.861 --> 22:22.645
How sad and awful is that?

22:24.908 --> 22:28.608
Enough wallowing, though,
let's have another round.

22:28.651 --> 22:30.523
-On me.
-Ronnie, I'm...

22:30.566 --> 22:32.263
I'm good. I'm definitely
feeling it.

22:32.307 --> 22:35.354
Same. I... How are you
not tipsier, Vee?

22:35.397 --> 22:38.618
You've had more shots
than both of us
put together.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.883
Actually, now that
you mention it...

22:45.015 --> 22:48.105
I don't feel the alcohol
at all.

23:06.515 --> 23:10.040
Your palladium is killing me.
My hair is falling out.

23:10.084 --> 23:15.263
I'm losing a ton of weight,
Dr. Curdle said my symptoms
suggest acute anemia.

23:15.306 --> 23:16.482
Anemia?

23:16.525 --> 23:17.961
That's interesting.

23:18.005 --> 23:20.094
A diagnosis of anemia
means the level of metals

23:20.137 --> 23:21.835
in your blood
is practically nonexistent,

23:21.878 --> 23:24.838
which would account
for your plummeting weight.

23:24.881 --> 23:26.709
It's feasible the palladium
has neutralized

23:26.753 --> 23:29.146
the other metals
in your body,
compromising you.

23:29.190 --> 23:31.540
I'm not wearing the palladium
pendant anymore.

23:31.584 --> 23:34.500
I dumped the rest of your soup,
so why am I still weakening?

23:34.543 --> 23:37.807
[sighs] It could be
at this point that...

23:37.851 --> 23:41.681
you've poisoned your body
and it's simply breaking down.

23:41.724 --> 23:43.944
[scoffs] So what
can I do, Cheryl?

23:45.075 --> 23:47.121
Replenish your
iron-depleted system.

23:47.164 --> 23:51.299
Rebalance your humors,
whilst I consult
my medical texts.

23:51.342 --> 23:53.649
[Alice] Hey, did you
have a fun night?

23:53.693 --> 23:59.612
What the hell were you
thinking lying about
the serial killer gene, Mom?

23:59.655 --> 24:01.309
What? No, I did not,

24:01.352 --> 24:03.703
and watch your tone with me,
young lady.

24:03.746 --> 24:08.098
At the farm, you and Polly said
that I was the only member
of our family who had the gene,

24:08.142 --> 24:11.841
but back in the day,
Dad made you get tested

24:12.712 --> 24:13.930
and you have it too.

24:16.585 --> 24:18.500
That... that is absurd.

24:18.544 --> 24:23.505
How about the fact that
Dad was grooming me
to be a murderer

24:23.549 --> 24:25.681
just like him? Did you know?

24:25.725 --> 24:28.423
No, absolutely not.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.600
That didn't happen, Betty.
Where is this coming from?

24:31.644 --> 24:32.558
Is this your...

24:32.601 --> 24:34.647
your persecution
complex again?

24:34.690 --> 24:36.126
Oh, my God.

24:36.170 --> 24:42.219
Whatever. I promise you,
I will get to the truth, Mom.

24:44.091 --> 24:45.614
[Cheryl] Raven-haired goddess.

24:45.658 --> 24:48.138
Thank God you exist, Cheryl.
You're the only person I know

24:48.182 --> 24:50.793
who grows poisonous plants
in their greenhouse.

24:50.837 --> 24:53.448
As requested, I prepared
an assortment for you.

24:53.492 --> 24:57.931
Hemlock, night shade,
snake root, rosary peas
and white oleander.

24:58.671 --> 25:00.673
These are perfect.

25:00.716 --> 25:04.546
I want to test a hunch,
that the toxins my body
is producing

25:04.590 --> 25:09.159
are making me immune
to other poisons.

25:09.203 --> 25:12.598
Just remember, there's no shame
in having your stomach pumped.

25:12.641 --> 25:15.818
I will have a private ambulance
on standby.

25:16.732 --> 25:18.691
Also...

25:18.734 --> 25:22.825
you wouldn't happen to have
any books about spiders,
would you?

25:22.869 --> 25:26.655
But of course. How many
would you like?

25:26.699 --> 25:29.179
[Betty] Okay, now that
we've banged around
in my subconscious,

25:29.223 --> 25:32.574
it's time to excavate my mom's
to find out what she knows

25:32.618 --> 25:34.750
about my core wound,
that I don't.

25:36.491 --> 25:37.971
Uh...

25:38.014 --> 25:40.582
I don't know if I feel
super comfortable
with that.

25:40.626 --> 25:42.802
You have my permission.

25:42.845 --> 25:46.457
This is like the equivalent
of her reading my diary
in high school.

25:46.501 --> 25:50.679
She's hiding
something big, Jug.
I mean, what if she saw

25:50.723 --> 25:52.420
proof that my dad
was grooming me?

25:52.463 --> 25:54.857
What if she knew that
he was the Black Hood?

25:54.901 --> 25:56.729
I will do all the work
and prompt her.

25:56.772 --> 26:01.037
You just have to stand
close enough to hear
whatever shakes loose.

26:05.302 --> 26:08.654
[sighs] Excuse me!
You can't just barge
in here like this.

26:08.697 --> 26:09.916
We're about to go live.

26:09.959 --> 26:12.353
What are you hiding
about Dad?

26:12.396 --> 26:14.747
I know it's something big,
so why don't you just...

26:14.790 --> 26:16.618
Why don't you just tell me?

26:16.662 --> 26:18.620
What is the worst thing
that has happened
in our house

26:18.664 --> 26:19.752
that you've kept hidden
from me?

26:19.795 --> 26:21.623
I am not hiding anything.

26:21.667 --> 26:22.798
You know everything.

26:22.842 --> 26:23.712
[echoing] You know
everything about him.

before I call security.
-Come on.

26:38.422 --> 26:39.859
Come on. I got
what we need.

26:43.906 --> 26:45.342
[Jughead] It's underneath
the table.

26:47.214 --> 26:49.695
Under the floorboards
in the dining room.

26:49.738 --> 26:50.696
That's where the truth is.

26:50.739 --> 26:51.958

26:52.001 --> 26:53.829

Do you mind if I...

26:58.617 --> 26:59.922
Yeah, of course.

26:59.966 --> 27:01.620
Hey, Arch, are you okay?

27:03.752 --> 27:06.146
Okay, um,
I'll be right there.

27:08.017 --> 27:10.716
Looks like the past is
going to have to wait
a little bit longer.

27:10.759 --> 27:12.848
-Is he all right?
-Cheryl wants to talk
to both of us

27:12.892 --> 27:14.807
about her new-new plan.

27:14.850 --> 27:17.636
Well, hopefully, it's better
than palladium soup.

27:18.811 --> 27:19.681
[scoffs]

27:19.725 --> 27:21.378
[slurping]

27:21.422 --> 27:23.598
As promised, I continued
to do some research
on my archives

27:23.642 --> 27:25.992
and came across
an ancient spell
of transmutation

27:26.035 --> 27:28.255
in an alchemy book.

27:28.298 --> 27:30.649
And before you roll your eyes,
cousin, ancient alchemists
failed to create a formula

27:30.692 --> 27:33.739
that could turn basic metals
like lead or iron into gold,

27:33.782 --> 27:38.047
but they did devise
a spell that could
turn gold into iron.

27:38.091 --> 27:39.962
Not particularly useful...

27:40.615 --> 27:42.095
until now.

27:42.138 --> 27:45.620
Because after all,
what is palladium
but white gold?

27:45.664 --> 27:47.013
How is this going to help me?

27:47.056 --> 27:49.450
If the spell was used on you,
it could potentially

27:49.493 --> 27:53.323
neutralize the palladium that
has seeped into your body
by transmitting it into iron,

27:53.367 --> 27:55.848
the very iron your body
so desperately craves.

27:55.891 --> 27:59.242
Moreover, if I apply
a certain amount
of heat to your body,

27:59.286 --> 28:01.984
the way the ancient alchemists
did to metal,

28:02.028 --> 28:03.899
you could be forged.

28:03.943 --> 28:05.945
"Forged"? Meaning?

28:05.988 --> 28:09.252
Strengthened,
made impervious.

28:09.296 --> 28:10.863
Perhaps even to palladium.

28:10.906 --> 28:12.125
Well, then, let's...

28:12.778 --> 28:14.083
let's do it.

28:14.127 --> 28:16.912
-Forge me, now.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold on.

28:16.956 --> 28:18.914
Are there side effects
to this spell?

28:18.958 --> 28:23.266
Yes. Since you are currently
in a weakened state

28:23.310 --> 28:26.487
the heat needed for forging
might kill you.

28:26.530 --> 28:29.272
That's a pretty significant
side effect, Cheryl.

28:29.316 --> 28:31.579
The palladium is
already killing me.

28:31.622 --> 28:33.929
-True.
-I'll do it.

28:33.973 --> 28:36.540
But before we do,
can Betty and I have
one more night?

28:37.846 --> 28:38.934
Of course.

29:59.232 --> 30:01.582
[Cheryl] And how
are we feeling today?

30:01.625 --> 30:04.063

No hangover,

30:17.032 --> 30:19.513
however venomous
spiders may be,

30:19.556 --> 30:21.558
they don't ever
poison themselves.

30:21.602 --> 30:25.519
And most spiders can
control the amount
of venom they secrete

30:25.562 --> 30:28.087
-at their own volition.
-A-ha.

30:28.130 --> 30:30.176
Meaning, mayhap,
you can modulate

30:30.219 --> 30:31.699
the poison you secrete
as well.
