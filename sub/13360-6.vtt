(EXHALING)

00:07.489 --> 00:08.499
There's not enough
to go around.

00:08.532 --> 00:10.099
Give me that.

00:10.132 --> 00:12.999
-It's all muscle.
-Indeed!

00:13.032 --> 00:14.666
Right. You're next.

00:16.332 --> 00:17.666
Are you sure about this?

00:18.432 --> 00:19.799
Him? He's a mouse.

00:19.832 --> 00:21.232
They call him "The Destroyer".

00:21.266 --> 00:23.099
Of what? Butterflies?

00:23.132 --> 00:25.966
I'll have you know,
I have never been beaten.

00:26.966 --> 00:29.532
Almost never been beaten.

00:29.566 --> 00:31.299
Why do they call him
"The Destroyer"?

00:31.332 --> 00:33.899
The Destroyed.
You're not hearing it right.

00:33.932 --> 00:37.266
-You need a name.
A fighter's name.
-(CROWD CHEERING)

00:37.299 --> 00:40.166
-Hercules, the Hairy.
-Hmm. Too...

00:40.199 --> 00:42.099
True.

00:42.132 --> 00:44.532
-Hercules the Hero.
-That's my girl.

No, that's too wet.

00:46.199 --> 00:49.066
-Hercules the Horrid.
-Smelling.

00:49.099 --> 00:50.166
Hercules the Horrid-Smelling?

00:50.199 --> 00:52.432
-That's it!
-JASON: That's the one.

Are you all right?

02:09.779 --> 02:11.046
Never better.

02:13.112 --> 02:15.146
It was very noble of you
to let him win.

02:15.179 --> 02:16.612
(CHUCKLES)

02:16.645 --> 02:18.212
Come on...

02:18.245 --> 02:20.979
This is all your fault,
giving me that
ridiculous name.

02:21.446 --> 02:22.746
What? Oh...

02:22.779 --> 02:24.346
(CROWD CHEERS)

-MEDUSA: Whoo!

03:04.519 --> 03:05.719
Stop. Stop fussing!

03:05.752 --> 03:07.619
There may be easier ways
of getting her attention.

03:07.652 --> 03:09.886
Get whose attention?
What are you talking about?

03:09.919 --> 03:13.086
Uh, she's about so high...

03:13.119 --> 03:15.552
-Dark hair, big eyes.
-Lovely smile.

03:15.586 --> 03:20.152
You think I would put
my life on the line just
to impress Medusa?

03:20.786 --> 03:22.752
Shame on you.

03:22.786 --> 03:24.752
I do it for the honour.

03:24.786 --> 03:28.952
Wrestling...is...
in my blood. Huh...

03:28.986 --> 03:33.919
You know, even as a baby
I strangled a snake
with my bare hands.

03:33.952 --> 03:36.619
Is that true?

03:36.652 --> 03:40.852
Look, all I'm saying is,
if you and Medusa
are meant to be together,

03:40.886 --> 03:42.386
then she'll love you
for who you are.

03:42.419 --> 03:46.619
All I'm telling you
is this is who I am.
Hercules the...

03:46.652 --> 03:47.952
No, let's not go there.

03:53.052 --> 03:56.319
Nothing can divert him
from his target.

03:56.352 --> 03:58.552
I had hoped
she would be
a passing fancy.

03:58.586 --> 04:02.726
Like Drina the cook,
or Iola the tailor's wife,

04:02.759 --> 04:06.859
or Abellone,
the trainee guard.

04:07.726 --> 04:09.192
Don't ask.

04:10.926 --> 04:15.192
I can understand why
he might find her attractive.

04:15.859 --> 04:17.592
It is more...

04:17.626 --> 04:20.259
What she might find
attractive in him.

04:20.659 --> 04:21.959
Indeed.

04:23.659 --> 04:25.459
He has a big heart.

04:25.492 --> 04:28.226
-And is brave.
-So he says.

04:28.259 --> 04:30.259
-And loyal.
-To his stomach.

04:30.292 --> 04:32.659
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

04:32.692 --> 04:36.625
As much as I love him,
I fear she does
not feel the same.

04:36.659 --> 04:40.659
After all,
what can he offer her
in terms of security?

04:40.692 --> 04:43.359
He has no job. No money.

04:43.392 --> 04:45.226
Even this house
isn't really his.

04:46.326 --> 04:47.392
(SIGHS)

04:47.426 --> 04:48.426
It cannot end well.

04:50.159 --> 04:51.726

05:28.199 --> 05:29.832
(WATER TRICKLING)

05:34.332 --> 05:36.632
I did not summon you lightly.

05:36.666 --> 05:39.999
These past days I have felt
the presence of the God

05:40.032 --> 05:42.099
more strongly than
ever before.

05:42.132 --> 05:45.032
The same dream haunts me
day and night.

05:45.066 --> 05:47.332
Even now
it invades my thought.

05:48.699 --> 05:50.299
I see a figure.

05:51.232 --> 05:52.632
A woman of great power.

05:52.666 --> 05:53.866
Can you see her face?

05:54.932 --> 05:57.166
My dreams
are clouded in shadow!

06:01.472 --> 06:03.772
Could it be the Queen?

06:03.806 --> 06:05.772
Could it be Pasiphae?

06:09.006 --> 06:10.539
You are right
to fear the Queen.

06:10.572 --> 06:12.972
She is dangerous indeed.

06:13.006 --> 06:16.239
But Pasiphae stands
unabashed in the light.

06:16.272 --> 06:17.406
Her intentions are clear.

06:17.439 --> 06:22.739
This woman lurks
in the darkness,
concealing her face...

06:24.239 --> 06:26.206
One thing is certain.

06:28.272 --> 06:30.072
It's you she seeks.

06:32.839 --> 06:36.606
Ah, my good friend,
feasting like a king, I see.

06:36.639 --> 06:39.106
If mice have kings, then yes.

06:42.172 --> 06:44.739
-Oh. How are your injuries?
-I am in fine health.

06:44.772 --> 06:48.906
This was no more than a blip
on an otherwise untarnished
reign of terror.

06:48.939 --> 06:51.906
Hercules the Horrid
will return.

06:51.939 --> 06:53.972
Or Hercules the Foolish,
as you would have me known.

06:54.006 --> 06:56.372
Enjoy your time in my house.
Well...

06:56.406 --> 06:59.979
Not actually my house,
but you know what I mean.

07:00.012 --> 07:01.079
Hercules...

07:03.479 --> 07:04.946
I'm sorry.

07:04.979 --> 07:06.846
We are worried about you,
that is all.

07:07.712 --> 07:09.579
Enjoy your breakfast.

07:21.049 --> 07:22.649
Hercules.

07:22.682 --> 07:25.715
The gods are smiling
on me today. (LAUGHS)

07:50.349 --> 07:51.949
Till tomorrow.

07:52.449 --> 07:54.682
My friend...

07:54.715 --> 07:57.515
The Goddess of Love
is a tough mistress.

07:57.549 --> 07:59.849
You know she has
my utmost devotion.

07:59.882 --> 08:02.355
That will go some way
to appeasing her,

08:02.389 --> 08:05.455
but you have very
little else to offer.

08:05.489 --> 08:07.355
You are not a rich man.

08:07.389 --> 08:10.089
As everybody suddenly
seems to have noticed.

08:10.122 --> 08:12.622
I wish only to see you happy.

08:12.655 --> 08:18.222
I fear that
Aphrodite may never
answer your prayers.

08:18.255 --> 08:22.755
-If you are truly serious
about this girl...
-I am.

08:22.789 --> 08:26.089
There is another way
to capture her heart.

08:28.089 --> 08:29.222
An enchantment.

08:30.755 --> 08:32.889
-Thank you for your
concern, but no.
-Wait.

08:32.922 --> 08:35.289
I know nothing of sorcery.
Nor do I want to.

08:35.322 --> 08:37.455
You have heard of
the Witches of Colchis?

08:37.489 --> 08:38.989
I've heard nothing good.

08:39.022 --> 08:41.789
-You know of their powers?
-Of course.

08:41.822 --> 08:46.455
There is talk that
one of their number
can be found in a cave

08:46.489 --> 08:48.722
high in the
Mountains of the Sun.

08:50.989 --> 08:54.922
You are very kind, Elias,
but even if I wanted to,

08:54.955 --> 08:56.589
I cannot afford
these services.

08:56.622 --> 08:59.022
That is where you are wrong.

08:59.055 --> 09:00.822
I have heard
that rich or poor,

09:00.855 --> 09:03.195
the payment is the same.

09:03.229 --> 09:08.195
You must give her your
most precious possession.

(KNIFE SLICING)

09:24.195 --> 09:26.295

celebrating something?

09:26.329 --> 09:28.062
It's for Hercules.

09:28.595 --> 09:29.895
What? All of it?

09:29.929 --> 09:33.129
He heard us talking about
him last night, on the roof.

09:33.162 --> 09:34.162
Oh.

09:35.329 --> 09:36.629
Oh, indeed.

09:36.662 --> 09:38.862
-Where is he?
-I don't know.

09:39.495 --> 09:41.529
He should be back soon.

09:42.729 --> 09:45.062
Are you sure?
His sword and bag are gone.

Circe of Colchis?

10:49.935 --> 10:51.169
I do.

10:51.202 --> 10:54.002
You will have no need
for your weapon here,
Hercules.

10:56.602 --> 10:58.435
You wonder how
I know your name?

10:58.469 --> 11:00.975
I wonder what else
you know about me.

11:02.442 --> 11:05.475
Come, you have
no need to be afraid.

11:05.509 --> 11:08.342
You have travelled far,
your quest must be
an important one.

11:08.375 --> 11:09.775
It is most important to me.

11:11.642 --> 11:13.842
I wish to capture the heart
of the woman I love.

11:15.775 --> 11:20.175
I'm afraid I cannot offer you
guidance in such matters.

11:20.209 --> 11:22.075
The fates spin
man's moira, not I.

11:22.109 --> 11:26.375
I understand that,
but I think the fates
need some assistance.

11:27.409 --> 11:29.809
I've heard your powers
are unrivalled.

11:30.975 --> 11:32.075
Please.

11:33.675 --> 11:35.875
She means
everything to me.

11:37.375 --> 11:39.409
I've brought an offering.

11:42.942 --> 11:45.375
My most valued possession.

11:48.675 --> 11:51.442
It is the last remaining link
to my father.

11:52.975 --> 11:53.975
Go on.

11:58.509 --> 12:04.249
At night, he used to tell me
the most wonderful stories.

12:04.282 --> 12:08.315
I was never happier than
in those few moments
before sleep.

12:09.782 --> 12:11.915
One day he came
home with that tooth,

12:11.949 --> 12:14.715
plucked from
the foaming jaws of Cerberus,

12:14.749 --> 12:17.615
the beast that guards
the underworld.

12:17.649 --> 12:20.182
Or, so he said.

12:20.215 --> 12:25.015
He told me to keep it
beside my bed,
to ward off evil spirits.

12:25.049 --> 12:26.982
I've done so ever since.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.849
I do not give it up lightly.

12:32.115 --> 12:34.415
Your story is indeed moving.

12:36.582 --> 12:39.349
Tell me, why did you
journey here alone?

12:39.382 --> 12:42.482
Your friends do not
support your desire?

12:42.515 --> 12:45.115
My friends think me a fool.

12:45.149 --> 12:47.215
I don't believe that.

12:47.249 --> 12:50.015
They have risked
their lives for you
many times, have they not?

12:51.082 --> 12:52.282
And they would again.

12:53.515 --> 12:55.649
You know what I do believe?

12:55.682 --> 12:58.315
I believe the gods
brought us together.

13:09.555 --> 13:11.622
If you wish Medusa
to fall in love with you,

13:11.655 --> 13:13.389
then there is no more
powerful an enchantment

13:13.422 --> 13:15.589
than that contained
in this jar.

13:15.622 --> 13:17.722
For it holds the
Song of the Sirens.

13:18.889 --> 13:21.722
The sound is irresistible.

13:21.755 --> 13:24.322
Once opened, make sure
you're the first person
your love sees

13:24.355 --> 13:26.222
and it will not fail you.

13:27.289 --> 13:30.822
But think before
you use it, Hercules.

13:32.122 --> 13:34.455
Such magic is powerful indeed.

13:51.389 --> 13:54.789
-We are pleased
to see you, old friend.
-HERCULES: Eh.

13:54.822 --> 13:57.755
What's the matter?
Were you afraid
I wouldn't come back?

13:57.789 --> 14:00.895
Leave you all alone here
in this house I don't own.

14:03.195 --> 14:04.629
We are truly sorry.

14:04.662 --> 14:06.529
It wasn't our intention
to upset you.

14:06.562 --> 14:09.895
I know. And much as
it pains me to admit it,

14:09.929 --> 14:13.329
there may be some truth
in what you said.

14:13.362 --> 14:16.262
-Does this mean
we're forgiven?
-Mmm.

14:16.295 --> 14:17.629
Cheese would have
sealed the deal.

14:21.495 --> 14:23.695
HERCULES: Thank you, Korinna.

14:23.729 --> 14:25.862
I need
but a moment of her time.

14:25.895 --> 14:31.262
-If anyone catches you...
-Don't worry, they won't,
for I am nimble of foot.

14:49.262 --> 14:51.529
(SONG OF THE SIRENS PLAYING)

15:12.669 --> 15:14.369
Yes, well...

15:14.402 --> 15:17.269
What are you
doing here, Hercules?

15:19.069 --> 15:20.235
Hercules?

15:20.269 --> 15:23.269
Yes, um.
I came to warn you...

15:24.269 --> 15:27.202
-There's a storm coming.
-A storm?

15:27.802 --> 15:29.435
It appears so. Yes.

15:29.469 --> 15:34.502
I might be wrong, of course,
but I thought it was
best that you knew.

15:34.535 --> 15:37.102
-How kind.
-I didn't want you to get wet.

15:37.135 --> 15:40.302
I know how frustrating
that can be.

15:40.335 --> 15:42.235
I wondered if you wanted
to meet me this evening?

15:42.269 --> 15:45.335
That's, if you're not
engaged in other matters.

15:45.369 --> 15:47.269
(EXHALES) I am not.

15:48.369 --> 15:49.902
And I would be delighted.

15:49.935 --> 15:51.002
Thank you.

15:51.035 --> 15:53.435
I don't mean thank you,
I mean...

-You know what I mean.

it out sooner, really.

32:35.333 --> 32:36.633
What with the belly.

32:36.667 --> 32:40.700
-It's not very funny
though, is it?
-No. No, it is not.

-PYTHAGORAS: Not if he's
stuck like this forever.

32:45.067 --> 32:46.467
Do you think Circe
will turn him back?

32:47.600 --> 32:49.967
Don't worry, old friend.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.333
We'll save your bacon.

32:54.100 --> 32:56.500
-That's good. Yeah.
-Thank you! (LAUGHS)

-What was that?
-I don't know.

34:27.547 --> 34:28.947
You could have warned me
they live in the forest.

34:28.980 --> 34:31.313
They don't.
Someone must have
summoned it.

34:31.347 --> 34:34.013
Would you be worried if I said
I think it's after you?

34:34.047 --> 34:35.513
No, no.
I'd be fine with that.

34:35.547 --> 34:37.580
Good. Because I think
it's after you.

34:37.613 --> 34:38.847
Go!

Oh...

35:17.053 --> 35:19.253
Right. You'll be safe here.

35:20.720 --> 35:23.820
You cannot go alone.
Think of what the Oracle said.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.220
I will return.

35:28.253 --> 35:30.320
Right, you look
after him, okay?

35:30.753 --> 35:32.187
(GRUNTING)

36:16.578 --> 36:18.212
The gods were not wrong.

36:18.245 --> 36:20.645
You are indeed
brave and loyal.

36:21.578 --> 36:23.045
What do you know
of these things?

36:23.078 --> 36:24.845
More than you think.

36:26.145 --> 36:28.512
-I believe you found Hercules.
-What do you want?

36:28.545 --> 36:33.345
Exactly what I have...
You, here, alone.

36:33.378 --> 36:35.045
We are allies, you and I.

36:35.945 --> 36:37.178
I find that unlikely.

36:38.078 --> 36:39.645
We want the same thing.

36:39.678 --> 36:42.445
I want to right the wrongs
done to my friends.

36:42.478 --> 36:43.712
Hercules and Medusa
are good people

36:43.745 --> 36:46.445
and they deserve
no part in your games.

36:46.478 --> 36:49.912
I'll help your friends,
but I have a request.

36:51.945 --> 36:53.612
Won't you join me?

37:05.645 --> 37:07.751
I haven't always
lived like this.

37:08.751 --> 37:10.885
Once, I had
a husband that I loved.

37:11.251 --> 37:13.385
A home.

37:13.418 --> 37:17.785
Until someone sought to take
those things away from me
and turn me into this.

37:17.818 --> 37:21.951
I have spent
many years wondering why
and I still have no answer.

37:23.451 --> 37:27.018
There are those
that are consumed
by pure hatred.

37:27.052 --> 37:29.818
My sister is such a creature.

37:29.852 --> 37:31.652
She does not deserve
to live any longer.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.085
What does this have
to do with me?

37:37.452 --> 37:38.718
I want you to kill her.

37:41.718 --> 37:44.852
I don't know what you've
heard about me but...

37:45.452 --> 37:47.785
I am not a murderer.

37:47.818 --> 37:51.752
I'm sorry, I can play
no part in your revenge.

37:51.785 --> 37:55.818
That is your choice.
But I have named my price.

37:55.852 --> 37:58.518
Can you live with
the consequence
of saying no?

38:03.552 --> 38:05.685
Her story is sad indeed.

38:06.252 --> 38:07.458
Sad enough to kill for?

38:09.992 --> 38:12.158
I don't think I can do it.

38:12.192 --> 38:13.992
I am not a murderer.

38:15.092 --> 38:16.625
I know I couldn't.

38:18.692 --> 38:20.325
There is no shame
in saying no.

38:22.458 --> 38:27.992
If I refuse to help her,
then I am condemning
Hercules and Medusa to death.

38:29.458 --> 38:33.025
And how would
you feel if I failed to
save our friends?

38:34.225 --> 38:36.025
I will support you...

38:36.992 --> 38:37.992
Whatever you decide.

38:41.158 --> 38:43.492
I would feel
I had deserted them

38:44.492 --> 38:46.858
and let something
very wrong occur.

38:50.492 --> 38:53.658
I would feel that I'd cared
too much for myself.

38:55.892 --> 38:58.692
And that is why
you are the noblest of us all.

39:02.792 --> 39:04.658
All this for the love
of a woman.

39:06.725 --> 39:09.798
There is much to be said
for triangles.

39:09.832 --> 39:10.898
Yeah.

39:16.398 --> 39:17.965
I had hoped you would return.

39:21.665 --> 39:23.498
I do this for my friends.

39:24.165 --> 39:25.632
Of course.

39:27.865 --> 39:29.898
There is no alliance
between you and I.

39:31.498 --> 39:33.832
-No.
-And there never will be.

39:34.232 --> 39:35.432
As you wish.

39:36.398 --> 39:38.398
How do I know I can trust you?

39:38.432 --> 39:41.532
I may be many things
but I am good for my word.

39:41.565 --> 39:44.032
I trust that you are too.

39:44.065 --> 39:47.732
I am sure I need not warn
you of the consequences
if you fail me.

39:48.965 --> 39:50.332
Come.

39:50.365 --> 39:53.032
We must seal
our arrangement in the
eyes of the gods.

39:58.898 --> 40:00.565
As Hecate's our witness,

40:00.598 --> 40:02.798
-you will not cross me.
-(SIZZLING)

40:02.832 --> 40:04.965
You will know when the time
is right to strike.

40:04.998 --> 40:09.038
Until then,
may your injury serve as
a reminder of your oath.

40:09.072 --> 40:10.472
(GROANS)

40:13.572 --> 40:15.605
Where will I find your sister?

40:16.505 --> 40:18.672
In the Palace of Atlantis.

40:19.405 --> 40:20.772
Where she is Queen.

40:32.705 --> 40:34.505
MEDUSA: Pythagoras?

40:47.305 --> 40:49.572
All is well.
She just needs rest.

40:49.605 --> 40:53.472
And...
And she wants to see me?
She doesn't want to see me?

40:53.505 --> 40:55.472
I would leave it for a while.

40:55.505 --> 40:59.805
-You told her that no words
could express my regret?
-Yes.

40:59.838 --> 41:02.438
And that I had suffered.
I had spent time as a pig.

41:02.472 --> 41:04.638
-Yes.
-What did she say?

41:04.672 --> 41:07.245
I think it's...
It's probably best forgotten.

41:07.278 --> 41:08.445
Pythagoras!

41:10.278 --> 41:14.145
She said that a pig
was too good for you.

41:14.178 --> 41:17.578
Right. Well...
She could have said
worse, I suppose?

41:17.612 --> 41:20.345
And that, if she had known,
she would have caught you,

41:20.378 --> 41:23.278
roasted you
and fed you to the birds.

41:23.312 --> 41:25.578
Uh, she knows
I don't like birds.

41:27.112 --> 41:30.378
Perhaps I'll leave it a while.
She'll come round.

41:36.945 --> 41:38.712
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

41:41.012 --> 41:42.312
I need to speak with you.

41:44.578 --> 41:47.212
The figure you saw
in your dream.

41:47.245 --> 41:49.412
It was the witch. Circe.

41:51.245 --> 41:53.912
Because of her,
my friends nearly died.

41:57.912 --> 41:59.712
My vision was clear.

42:01.412 --> 42:03.745
It was you who was in danger.

42:04.912 --> 42:06.785
I trust you heeded my warning.

42:09.652 --> 42:14.118
A woman of that power
would not waste her time
on your friends.

42:15.818 --> 42:18.152
There is more, is there not?

42:20.118 --> 42:21.318
What happened?

42:23.718 --> 42:25.052
I had no choice.

42:33.785 --> 42:34.818
What did you promise?

42:35.685 --> 42:37.685
That I would kill her sister.

42:37.718 --> 42:40.452
-That I would kill Pasiphae.
-Jason!

42:42.952 --> 42:44.518
Oh, Jason.

what you have done.
