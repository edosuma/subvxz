00:01.235 --> 00:03.404
You're witnessing
the power of Empire.

00:03.437 --> 00:05.906
I'm Cookie Lyon, baby.
I'm unforgettable.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.675
Catch all-new episodes
Wednesdays.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.210
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:09.243 --> 00:12.012
Star, The Gifted,
and Lethal Weapon.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.548
That was the best idea
you've had all day.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:20.054
-Previously on Empire...
-I broke the law for your ass!

00:20.088 --> 00:22.356
The illegal handgun!
The parole violation!

00:22.390 --> 00:24.825
-Angelo. -...that you still have
feelings for that greasy...

00:24.858 --> 00:25.893
Hot mic, baby!

00:25.926 --> 00:27.195
You saved my life.

00:27.228 --> 00:30.431
That is why I'm fighting so hard
to get you back.

00:30.464 --> 00:32.366
While Lucious continues
his sabbatical,

00:32.400 --> 00:34.268
we will produce a new album
for every year

00:34.302 --> 00:35.936
we have been in operation.

00:35.969 --> 00:39.673
Detective Pamela Rose.
I'm the NYPD liaison.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.243
-You trying to set me up? -No.
I didn't even know who you were.

00:42.276 --> 00:44.345
-So it was a coincidence.
-THIRSTY: Mrs. Calhoun

00:44.378 --> 00:47.215
has been afraid to come forward
because she fears for her life.

00:47.248 --> 00:49.817
There's not a jury in the world
that will find her guilty.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.893
Well, there he is. Looking good.

00:59.927 --> 01:02.630
Exercising while Claudia
has a day off.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.232
(panting):
Claudia...

01:04.265 --> 01:07.101
prescribed that I do this
for 30 minutes a day.

01:07.135 --> 01:09.069
I've already knocked out 45.

01:09.103 --> 01:10.971
That is excellent.
Yeah, we're all here

01:11.004 --> 01:13.774
to support you and help you with
your rehab while she's gone.

01:13.807 --> 01:16.744
She left us an extensive list.
Believe that.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.879
Yeah, how's the, uh, leg, Pop?

01:18.912 --> 01:20.648
It's getting strong, son.

01:20.681 --> 01:21.982
Looking good, Dad.

01:22.015 --> 01:23.617
Thank you.

01:23.651 --> 01:26.154
Who's really looking good
is your mother.

01:26.187 --> 01:28.589
You're looking
especially lovely today.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.124
(laughing):
Oh.

01:30.158 --> 01:31.759
Well, I have a photo shoot.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.294
Ma just made Forbes magazine's

01:33.327 --> 01:34.995
100 Most Powerful Women
in Business.

01:35.028 --> 01:37.831
Just pictures
in magazines, y'all.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.600
Uh-uh, don't sell yourself
short. You should own it, Ma.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.402
Yeah, well, while I'm taking
pretty pictures,

01:41.435 --> 01:44.004
I need to be getting
20 For 20 on its feet.

01:44.037 --> 01:46.440
LUCIOUS:
Well, congratulations

01:46.474 --> 01:48.142
-with Forbes.
-Thank you.

01:48.176 --> 01:50.278
But what I think
y'all need to...

01:50.311 --> 01:54.582
y'all see that, I did a
conjugation of "you" and "all"?

01:54.615 --> 01:56.784
Like Lucious.

01:56.817 --> 01:59.086
What I need you guys to do

01:59.119 --> 02:02.356
is to stop tiptoeing around me.

02:02.390 --> 02:05.793
If I'm gonna get any better,
I need you guys...

02:05.826 --> 02:09.330
Leah said that I was a m...

02:09.363 --> 02:10.764
said I was a monster,

02:10.798 --> 02:12.666
so I need to know what I did

02:12.700 --> 02:15.703
to each of you individually that
made you guys call me a monster.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.671
COOKIE:
No.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.673
No. We're not gonna do this
right now, Lucious.

02:19.707 --> 02:21.041
You need to finish your rehab.

02:21.074 --> 02:22.776
You're doing so good.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.212
Well, you punched me
in the face.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.646
One shot, square.

02:25.679 --> 02:28.616
I'm so sorry, but I mean...

02:28.649 --> 02:30.984
why would I punch you
in the face?

02:31.018 --> 02:32.886
Mm-mm.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.255
Jamal.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.526
(laughs softly)

02:38.559 --> 02:41.395
I mean, Dad, it's not
gonna help anything.

02:41.429 --> 02:42.963
It's gonna help me.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.065
-Tell him the trash can story.
-Hakeem, shut up.

02:45.098 --> 02:47.601
No, boy, we are not doing that.

02:49.437 --> 02:53.207
Look, okay, Cookie,
you keep saying, uh,

02:53.241 --> 02:56.076
you were gone for 17 years.

02:56.109 --> 02:57.711
Why'd you leave?

03:06.920 --> 03:09.590
I-I got to go to work.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.563
*

03:24.738 --> 03:28.409
Just think of it
as an inverse Wizard of Oz,

03:28.442 --> 03:30.744
and the Lyon brothers

03:30.778 --> 03:32.946
are the Scarecrow, the Tin Man
and the Cowardly Lion.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.552
We will deprive each
of the thing he cherishes most.

03:38.586 --> 03:41.121
I'm assuming Andre
is the Scarecrow.

03:41.154 --> 03:43.624
And his brain
is his most prized possession,

03:43.657 --> 03:47.295
so your charge, Lana,
is to disabuse him of it.

03:47.328 --> 03:48.762
Hmm.

03:48.796 --> 03:51.131
Well, as for the Tin Man,

03:51.164 --> 03:54.568
I think I finally got him
to open up his heart.

03:54.602 --> 03:58.306
Yes. I am going to enjoy
watching Miss Cookie

03:58.339 --> 04:02.910
stand helplessly by
as you snatch it from his chest.

04:02.943 --> 04:05.979
Good job. I'll meet
with Hakeem later today.

04:06.013 --> 04:10.150
Oh, he so aptly fits the role
of the Cowardly Lion.

04:10.183 --> 04:12.486
Now, what's left for me to do?

04:12.520 --> 04:13.921
Take out Toto?

04:13.954 --> 04:16.123
(laughs)

04:16.156 --> 04:17.257
(mumbling):
Take out...

04:18.992 --> 04:20.494
Angelo, you are drunk.

04:21.529 --> 04:25.566
Well... least I ain't no whore.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.967
You little slut.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.168
(scoffs)

04:28.201 --> 04:30.304
You know, Scotch and jealousy

04:30.338 --> 04:32.840
are making you
show your ass, Angelo.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.408
It's pretty, ain't it?

04:34.442 --> 04:36.410
You know what?
Maybe I need to kick yours

04:36.444 --> 04:38.479
-back to San Diego wh...
-That's enough.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.681
-Mama.
-It is time for you to put

04:40.714 --> 04:43.684
this floundering
self-pity to rest.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.986
You are responsible
for this family's involvement

04:46.019 --> 04:47.521
with these loathsome creatures.

04:47.555 --> 04:49.289
So get a grip, Angelo.

04:49.323 --> 04:52.826
Find a place in the universe
and create a role for yourself.

04:58.366 --> 04:59.700
*

04:59.733 --> 05:00.934
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Oh.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.202
Good.

05:02.235 --> 05:04.605
Okay. Perfect.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.973
Now let's get you in the chair.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.808
Uh...

05:07.841 --> 05:09.610
N... That's Lucious' chair.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.312
Empire is the hottest company
in the entertainment space,

05:12.346 --> 05:14.047
and you are the shooting star.

05:14.081 --> 05:16.484
Revel in it, girl,
you belong here.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.464
Ah, perfect.

05:30.498 --> 05:32.466
Okay. Now let's get a profile.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.601
Turn to your left.

05:36.704 --> 05:39.072
WOMAN:
Turn to the left.

05:44.412 --> 05:46.346
(camera shutter clicks)

05:46.380 --> 05:48.649
Uh, I'm sorry, I have a meeting.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.518
Oh. You got an empire to run.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.853
-What? -We'll see you later
with the other Power Women.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.287
Okay.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.491
Ah, Cookie,
these are gonna be fabulous.

05:57.525 --> 06:00.661
-Great. -So, after your meeting,
you go to the bank, right?

06:00.694 --> 06:02.930
-Mm-hmm. -'Cause 20 For 20
might've got you into Forbes,

06:02.963 --> 06:05.265
but when you sign for that
$100 million line of credit,

06:05.298 --> 06:06.900
-we'll have the horsepower
to pay for it. -(sighs)

06:06.934 --> 06:08.368
I don't understand

06:08.402 --> 06:10.404
why we have to take out
a loan when we're loaded.

06:10.438 --> 06:11.772
Yeah, loaded, not liquid.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.206
The board will
never approve of us

06:13.240 --> 06:15.409
spending our own money, Ma.

06:15.443 --> 06:17.611
Now, don't worry,
I know my way around bankers.

06:17.645 --> 06:20.113
You just follow my lead.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.149
Yeah, yeah.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.053
(piano playing)

06:26.086 --> 06:27.254
JAMAL:
Come here, Dad.

06:28.288 --> 06:30.524
Man, check this out.

06:30.558 --> 06:34.428
This is a song
that you and me wrote together.

06:34.462 --> 06:36.063
When?

06:36.096 --> 06:37.465
When? Well, like a year ago.

06:37.498 --> 06:38.932
(piano playing)

06:49.510 --> 06:52.813
That's really nice.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.982
-(piano stops) -See, I find
this whole songwriting thing

06:55.015 --> 06:57.050
so fascinating.
I mean, how does it happen?

06:57.084 --> 06:59.419
Do you just, you know,
sit down at the piano,

06:59.453 --> 07:02.756
-and it just happen, or you...?
-I mean, sometimes.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.658
I mean, other times, it's...

07:04.692 --> 07:06.894
comes from when
you're running or walking

07:06.927 --> 07:09.296
or driving or sleeping.

07:09.329 --> 07:12.766
And I write, so it's-it's
a lyric or a melody,

07:12.800 --> 07:15.603
and you just stack it, and start
adding instruments and...

07:15.636 --> 07:16.804
What's all of this for?

07:16.837 --> 07:18.906
That's sheet music.

07:18.939 --> 07:22.109
Well, how do you get it
to be in the record?

07:22.142 --> 07:24.444
In order to make a, a record,

07:24.478 --> 07:27.915
you-you got to go
into a studio and record it.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.850
I want to see that.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.251
Take me to the studio, then.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.920
(laughs softly)

07:32.953 --> 07:35.188
No, man, it--
that's-that's at Empire.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.657
Then take me to Empire.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.771
Come on.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.472
We good, right?

07:52.506 --> 07:54.441
'Cause no one can see him,
no one can know that he's here.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.776
This is what I do, all right?

07:55.809 --> 07:58.011
-All right.
-Looking good, Lucious.

08:00.714 --> 08:03.016
Thurston. Thirsty?

08:03.050 --> 08:04.351
Thirsty.

08:04.384 --> 08:06.053
-That's a wonderful name.
-Yeah.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.055
(chuckles)

08:08.088 --> 08:09.857
Look, you really don't
remember me, boss?

08:09.890 --> 08:11.692
Or are you just, you know,
rocking us all to sleep,

08:11.725 --> 08:13.827
pulling the Lucious Lyon move?

08:13.861 --> 08:16.897
Well, I would think
if I remembered anyone,

08:16.930 --> 08:19.933
it would be someone dressed
as smooth as you dress.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.003
Yeah, okay.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.873
We good, come on.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.174
(whispering):
Does he always dress like that?

08:27.207 --> 08:28.709
Every damn day.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.914
BECKY: And so if you'll turn
your attention to the chart,

08:33.947 --> 08:35.849
you'll see the way
we intend to track progress

08:35.883 --> 08:38.552
on every album in 20 For 20.

08:38.586 --> 08:41.054
We are tracking artists,
producers, budgets

08:41.088 --> 08:42.723
and more importantly,

08:42.756 --> 08:44.558
whether or not
you are hitting your milestones.

08:44.592 --> 08:46.393
And you better
damn well hit 'em.

08:46.426 --> 08:47.995
Or you're gonna hit bricks.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.664
Look, people, we don't
have time to waste here

08:50.698 --> 08:52.499
or room for error.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.202
You got to think about this
like a, a military operation.

08:55.235 --> 08:58.772
-BECKY: Absolutely. -Continue.
-Like Operation Cookie, huh?

08:58.806 --> 09:01.575
(laughs softly) Shine,
you know they say you shouldn't

09:01.609 --> 09:03.911
show up to a meeting
that can start without you.

09:03.944 --> 09:07.180
-(laughs softly) -But since
you and your goons are here,

09:07.214 --> 09:10.217
there's your spot.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.355
One album?

09:15.388 --> 09:16.924
What's...? Nah.

09:16.957 --> 09:19.192
You may have a chart
and a schedule full of ones,

09:19.226 --> 09:21.394
but I ain't a one.

09:21.428 --> 09:22.562
Ask Lucious, he know.

09:22.596 --> 09:23.964
And Lucious ain't here.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.233
I'm running this.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.101
Look, I'm-a get back
to running my empire.

09:28.135 --> 09:29.569
That'll give you plenty of time

09:29.603 --> 09:31.805
to get that mangy mutt
out of my workplace.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.573
-Hey, he goes where I go.
-Yeah.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.709
I was talking to the dog, Shine.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.144
Hey, I own a stake
in this company.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.812
I got a seat
on the board, Cookie.

09:38.846 --> 09:40.413
One album is not enough!

09:40.447 --> 09:42.549
PRISON GUARD: I give this speech
to all the newbies.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.151
It's not complicated, but still,

09:44.184 --> 09:46.119
only some of you get it,
most of you don't.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.888
-(women clamoring) -If you're in
the former, you'll do all right.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.222
You're in the latter, you won't.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.659
Trust me,
you'll learn the hard way.

09:51.692 --> 09:54.327
Hey, quiet down now!

09:54.361 --> 09:55.863
Hey!

09:57.364 --> 09:59.232
You're cute.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.501
But you're a street chick,
you know the drill.

10:01.534 --> 10:05.605
Keep your head down,
nose clean and your mouth shut.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.808
Most important:

10:07.841 --> 10:10.844
tiny little thing like you
wants to survive in here,

10:10.878 --> 10:13.747
do not ever forget that every
last one of those ladies

10:13.781 --> 10:15.649
will just as soon smile at you

10:15.683 --> 10:18.551
as slice a buck 50
across your pretty little face.

10:20.353 --> 10:24.491
Oh. And if you need anything,
just dial nine for room service.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.363
Look, Shine, this ain't got
to be a pissing contest, okay?

10:30.397 --> 10:31.699
Well, you made it one.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.834
Coming at me
with that one album nonsense.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.169
You know, Lucious wouldn't
disrespect me like that.

10:36.203 --> 10:38.505
Lucious ain't here
right now, is he?

10:38.538 --> 10:40.173
Yeah, apparently not.

10:40.207 --> 10:43.043
How come he ain't shown his face
since that concert?

10:43.076 --> 10:44.678
Because nunya, that's why.

10:44.712 --> 10:47.347
Look, since you're acting
all concerned,

10:47.380 --> 10:51.819
he is focusing on his
rehabilitation right now.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.388
What you want, Shine?

10:56.489 --> 10:58.826
-Ten albums.
-(laughs)

10:58.859 --> 11:00.327
Boy, this meeting is over.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.162
Ain't nobody got time
for your nonsense.

11:02.195 --> 11:05.398
We both know 20 For 20
is just a roll of the dice.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.500
I'm the only one
you got left here

11:07.534 --> 11:09.269
that knows
how to produce a banger.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.207
Okay, three.

11:16.243 --> 11:17.745
Something wrong
with your calculator.

11:17.778 --> 11:18.912
How's that?

11:18.946 --> 11:20.948
That's nowhere next to my 25%
of the company.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.051
Seven.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.253
And Studio 3 on permanent
lockdown until I'm done.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.157
Five. And that's a quarter,

11:30.190 --> 11:32.826
since you want
to throw percentages around.

11:32.860 --> 11:35.262
First dibs on Studio 3,
no lock.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.430
I got 15 other albums
to produce. Are we good?

11:37.464 --> 11:41.501
That's that biblical wisdom
I'm talking about.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.004
-I'm impressed.
-(chuckles)

11:44.037 --> 11:45.505
I can live with five.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.340
Good.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.043
You're gonna do fine here,
Cookie.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.779
And tell Lucious
not to hurry back.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.513
-I like working with you.
-Mm-hmm.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.715
Yeah, I hope I like
these five you got.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.751
(knock on door)

11:57.785 --> 11:59.753
(Thirsty groans)

11:59.787 --> 12:02.622
You ready
for the weekend update?

12:02.655 --> 12:05.525
My-my people had
the incorrect intel on Giuliana.

12:05.558 --> 12:09.096
I mean... we-we looked under
every rock, nook and cranny.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.764
Even went through
a couple of crack houses.

12:10.798 --> 12:13.366
Now... I don't know, it's like
somebody beat us to the punch.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.534
I mean, this chick is ghost.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.603
Maybe you need new people.

12:16.636 --> 12:19.072
(chuckles)

12:19.106 --> 12:21.875
Yeah, you ain't lying on that.
Maybe.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.077
Drinking in the afternoon, huh?

12:24.111 --> 12:25.946
You all right? You're good?

12:25.979 --> 12:27.714
What else, Thirsty?

12:27.747 --> 12:31.484
Well, I mean, you know, Vegas
Metro can't find her, either.

12:31.518 --> 12:34.421
So the investigation continues,
which is good.

12:34.454 --> 12:37.124
But they-they want someone
to corroborate your statement.

12:37.157 --> 12:39.559
There is nobody else.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.594
Just me and Giuliana.

12:41.628 --> 12:43.530
And the guy she was
popping off to, right?

12:45.498 --> 12:48.135
Yeah, man, I copy. I get it.

12:48.168 --> 12:51.238
I mean, you know, but this is,
this is a high-profile case.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.006
All right? The police are
under a lot of pressure.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.142
They're not saying you're lying,

12:55.175 --> 12:56.143
but they just want
some confirmation

12:56.176 --> 12:57.344
that they're on the right track.

12:57.377 --> 13:02.115
How about the fact that Giuliana
is missing?

13:02.149 --> 13:03.516
How about that?

13:03.550 --> 13:06.987
How about that?
All right.

13:07.020 --> 13:11.424
I mean, you... you're preaching
to the converted, boss man.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.927
I will relay the message to 'em,

13:13.961 --> 13:16.429
without the attitude, of course.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.298
But we're on the same page,
right?

13:18.331 --> 13:19.933
Absolutely.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.669
Yeah. All right. I'm on it.

13:22.702 --> 13:24.604
(Thirsty sighs)

13:24.637 --> 13:27.640
(sighs)

13:38.251 --> 13:40.653
May I talk to you, Detective?

13:44.491 --> 13:47.027
Right outside the station.

13:47.060 --> 13:49.296
My, aren't we bold?

13:49.329 --> 13:52.532
So, you don't like it when
I show up at your office, huh?

13:52.565 --> 13:54.367
I wonder what would happen
if one of your colleagues

13:54.401 --> 13:55.702
saw you talking to a suspect.

13:55.735 --> 13:58.571
Who says you're a suspect?

14:03.243 --> 14:05.678
Fine.

14:05.712 --> 14:07.380
You want to know why
Giuliana Green is missing,

14:07.414 --> 14:08.681
I'll tell you why.

14:08.715 --> 14:11.218
Because anyone
who is stupid enough

14:11.251 --> 14:12.752
to try and kill my father

14:12.785 --> 14:15.522
is safer in hiding than facing
his kind of justice.

14:15.555 --> 14:18.992
Now, I told the Vegas Police
everything I know.

14:19.026 --> 14:21.361
You're the one pushing them
to keep questioning me

14:21.394 --> 14:22.829
when they should be trying

14:22.862 --> 14:24.531
to find my father's
would-be killer.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.336
You're perspiring.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.537
Out of breath.

14:30.570 --> 14:33.106
Deflecting.

14:33.140 --> 14:37.010
All behaviors associated
with someone telling a lie.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.611
Care to explain?

14:38.645 --> 14:40.948
(indistinct chatter nearby
and over radio)

14:56.296 --> 14:58.298
(sighs)

15:09.076 --> 15:12.312
Yo, where you from?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.919
Philly.

15:19.953 --> 15:23.756
Yo. We got a Philly girl
down here.

15:23.790 --> 15:25.825
Chyna.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.427
You got new peoples.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.763
Hold up.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.574
You from Philly?

15:41.608 --> 15:43.977
What part?

15:46.779 --> 15:48.248
What's your name?

15:48.281 --> 15:50.650
Why you asking
so many questions?

15:50.683 --> 15:52.319
(inmates exclaim)

15:52.952 --> 15:54.021
Uh-uh.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.989
-Bitch.
-(inmates yelling)

15:56.023 --> 15:58.391
Break it up!

15:59.959 --> 16:01.161
Come on.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.429
(indistinct shouting)

16:02.462 --> 16:05.132
Crazy bitch!

16:05.165 --> 16:08.301
I was trying to give you
some shower shoes!

16:19.079 --> 16:20.847
I was expecting Whit Houseworth.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.949
Whit's been called away
last minute.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.484
I'm Morris Loach,

16:24.517 --> 16:28.221
executive vice president
of corporate lending.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.590
This way.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.505
I have examined your request

16:45.538 --> 16:47.507
in conjunction
with the Empire portfolio

16:47.540 --> 16:50.077
and, while impressive,

16:50.110 --> 16:53.346
I'm afraid...

16:53.380 --> 16:56.183
we cannot extend you
a line of credit.

16:56.216 --> 16:59.819
Pardon? Empire has had our best
quarter in the last ten...

16:59.852 --> 17:02.055
We're exercising a position
of caution

17:02.089 --> 17:04.524
in the entertainment sector
right now.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.859
-I'm sorry.
-COOKIE: No, you're not sorry.

17:06.893 --> 17:10.230
In fact, you're over there
enjoying yourself, aren't you?

17:10.263 --> 17:12.232
Because you can't wait
to tell your little friends

17:12.265 --> 17:13.766
how you declined Empire

17:13.800 --> 17:16.669
and reminded us
of where we belong, right?

17:16.703 --> 17:18.205
Ms. Lyon, I assure you,

17:18.238 --> 17:21.674
our bank takes pride
in servicing every client.

17:21.708 --> 17:25.378
Empire has had steady growth
for damn near 20 years.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.747
And since going public,
we've increased market share

17:27.780 --> 17:28.948
and doubled revenue.

17:28.981 --> 17:30.617
You saw that in the file.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.619
(chuckles)
But you made up your mind

17:32.652 --> 17:35.722
before it hit your desk,
didn't you?

17:35.755 --> 17:37.590
I would call you
a bougie coward,

17:37.624 --> 17:42.562
but I am the chief executive
officer of Empire Enterprises,

17:42.595 --> 17:44.331
so I'll leave you with good day.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.901
Bitch.

17:59.512 --> 18:02.149
So, here's your plaques
and your awards.

18:02.182 --> 18:05.084
It's not all of 'em,
not even near, but...

18:05.118 --> 18:07.920
it's some of 'em.

18:07.954 --> 18:09.989
This is the green room.

18:10.022 --> 18:13.326
It's basically
where the artists come

18:13.360 --> 18:16.296
and chill or write
or drink or eat

18:16.329 --> 18:19.132
in between or before
they go into the studio.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.900
I built all of this?

18:20.933 --> 18:23.836
Dad, literally every single
thing in here, this is all you.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.306
-All this is mine?
-Yes, everything.

18:26.339 --> 18:29.942
Even these?

18:31.344 --> 18:33.180
(laughing):
Everything.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.447
(laughs)

18:36.483 --> 18:38.651
-It's mine.
-It's all you, man.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.620
-It's all you.
-(laughs)

18:42.655 --> 18:45.024
And this...
(sighs)

18:45.057 --> 18:47.727
...is one of your studios.

18:49.796 --> 18:53.132
Hmm. How many of these
do I have?

18:53.166 --> 18:55.468
A lot, Dad.

18:55.502 --> 18:56.469
Not just here--
L.A., everywhere.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.037
(phone rings)

18:58.070 --> 18:59.206
RECEPTIONIST (over intercom):
Jamal, Warren Hall

18:59.239 --> 19:01.274
is on his way up to see you.

19:01.308 --> 19:04.711
JAMAL: Why would you let...?
Never mind.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.145
Uh, Dad, chill, all right?

19:06.179 --> 19:08.448
Webb, watch, watch my dad.
Chill, Dad, all right?

19:08.481 --> 19:11.050
-Hey.
-Hey, baby.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.553
My meeting ended early,
so I came to take you to lunch.

19:13.586 --> 19:17.857
Oh, that's, um, that's so nice.
I, I got, um,

19:17.890 --> 19:20.493
I got to record and I'm trying
to lay down these, these vocals,

19:20.527 --> 19:22.161
so I just-- I only got
like an hour and a half.

19:22.195 --> 19:23.530
It's cool. I can wait with you.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.298
No, no, why don't we, why don't
we catch dinner tonight?

19:25.332 --> 19:26.699
'Cause then that way we can
just really chill, you know?

19:26.733 --> 19:29.135
Wait, is that your father
right there?

19:29.168 --> 19:31.371
No, man, that's-that's
the engineer.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.906
He's a legend. Are you crazy?

19:33.940 --> 19:36.008
I, um...

19:36.042 --> 19:39.178
I think it's so sweet that
you-you came to surprise me,

19:39.212 --> 19:40.580
-but I really need to...
-You know what, don't worry.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.415
Nah, I just need to lay down
these lyrics.

19:42.449 --> 19:43.483
-So it's a-- I'm having...
-Okay.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.984
I should have called.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.052
-Nah, it's-it's all good,
though. -That's okay.

19:46.085 --> 19:47.354
I'm happy to see you, you know?

19:47.387 --> 19:48.355
All right, I'll surprise you
another time.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.457
All right.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.396
So this right here,

19:56.429 --> 19:58.531
this is it.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.333
This is Studio 3,

20:00.367 --> 20:02.702
nicknamed The Hitmaker.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.337
I record here.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.505
Yeah.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.875
You recorded
your best-selling album here.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.877
It took three days.

20:10.910 --> 20:14.614
Nobody slept for 72 hours, not
even my ass, and I was a kid.

20:14.647 --> 20:15.948
-(laughs)
-But...

20:15.982 --> 20:18.418
but it went on to sell
over eight million copies,

20:18.451 --> 20:19.619
and now everybody wants
to record here

20:19.652 --> 20:21.254
'cause they feel like
the Lucious Lyon magic

20:21.288 --> 20:24.291
will, like, sprinkle on them
or something.

20:24.324 --> 20:28.528
You know, I'm the one with
the Lucious Lyon magic, so...

20:28.561 --> 20:31.731
Listen to this.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.733
("Chasing the Sky" playing)

20:33.766 --> 20:36.903
This is the song that I said
that we wrote together.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.405
Look.

20:38.438 --> 20:39.472
These the keys.

20:39.506 --> 20:41.941
(piano playing)

20:46.078 --> 20:47.714
And the strings.

20:47.747 --> 20:48.915
(strings playing with piano)

20:48.948 --> 20:50.817
Come here.

20:50.850 --> 20:53.653
-(whispering): Wow.
-Look.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.388
Then the bass drops.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.757
(both laugh)

20:58.691 --> 21:02.061
*

21:02.094 --> 21:03.229
It's dope, right?

21:03.262 --> 21:04.997
What is this?

21:05.031 --> 21:06.633
"Chasing the Sky."

21:06.666 --> 21:09.235
No, I mean this.
What is this?

21:09.268 --> 21:11.438
Oh, this is the,
um, the mixing board.

21:11.471 --> 21:15.908
It's basically how the engineer
takes the song to completion.

21:15.942 --> 21:19.145
And I worked on this?

21:19.178 --> 21:20.847
Man, you used to work
on all of this.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.449
You didn't even need
an engineer.

21:22.482 --> 21:26.085
You just rolled up in the studio
and was like, "I'm the king."

21:26.118 --> 21:27.654
(chuckles)

21:27.687 --> 21:29.656
Go ahead.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.495
(music blaring)

21:35.528 --> 21:37.764
Ha, that's a little too--
that's a little too loud.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.031
It's all right.
It's all right, Dad.

21:41.534 --> 21:45.137
I don't feel connected
to none of this stuff.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.207
(music stops)

21:48.240 --> 21:50.943
Can we, um, maybe just talk
for a minute?

21:50.977 --> 21:52.912
Of course.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.852
Hakeem said something earlier
about a trash can...

21:59.886 --> 22:01.721
-(overlapping chatter)
-Come on, man.

22:01.754 --> 22:03.690
-Relax, man, relax, I'm good.
-Sir.

22:03.723 --> 22:04.857
Yo, what's up, Webb?

22:04.891 --> 22:05.858
WEBB:
I tried to explain to him

22:05.892 --> 22:07.326
this area's off-limits
right now.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.829
Lucious.

22:11.531 --> 22:13.466
Moonshine.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.668
Moonshine?
We on it like that now?

22:15.702 --> 22:17.136
He's a friend of mine, right?

22:17.169 --> 22:19.038
Moonshine.

22:19.071 --> 22:21.641
Yeah, but you know what,
we better get up out of here.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.510
So, Dad, let's...
Come on, let's hit it.

22:23.543 --> 22:26.946
But Moonshine and I have
been friends a long time.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.216
Yeah. Day ones.

22:30.249 --> 22:32.051
Yeah, we made
rap music together.

22:32.084 --> 22:35.588
Okay, so you're gonna throw
that in my face now.

22:35.622 --> 22:39.025
Nah, Lucious, we didn't make
rap music together.

22:39.058 --> 22:40.893
Well, we'd do a few jams,

22:40.927 --> 22:42.529
made a lot of money
in the street.

22:42.562 --> 22:44.531
Meaning, like, uh,
street parties.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.933
'Cause before there was Empire
or anything,

22:46.966 --> 22:49.502
y'all used to throw...
it's just, uh...

22:49.536 --> 22:51.704
these...
these dope block parties.

22:51.738 --> 22:54.240
Mm. Yeah.

22:54.273 --> 22:56.709
Everybody who was anybody
from Philly was there.

22:56.743 --> 22:59.278
Will Smith. The Roots.

22:59.311 --> 23:02.949
Rocky Balboa.
Remember that?

23:06.986 --> 23:11.290
To be perfectly honest with you,
Moonshine, I don't.

23:11.323 --> 23:15.027
But I'm curious, um...

23:15.061 --> 23:19.265
w-we were friends
since we were kids,

23:19.298 --> 23:23.736
and you make music
and I make music.

23:23.770 --> 23:27.907
Why didn't he and I ever
make a song together?

23:29.776 --> 23:31.444
(sighs)

23:31.478 --> 23:32.779
I don't know, brother.

23:35.181 --> 23:37.083
But like I said, it's all good.

23:37.116 --> 23:41.053
We're here now, right?
Empire's 20 years strong...

23:41.087 --> 23:43.623
and we've been friends
longer than that.

23:43.656 --> 23:46.759
So that's why you're here.
To make music.

23:46.793 --> 23:49.261
Yeah. But nothing like
the soft-ass R&B

23:49.295 --> 23:51.263
your boy here's making.
(laughs)

23:51.297 --> 23:52.999
Man, get your ass up
out of here with that.

23:53.032 --> 23:54.767
Listen, in honor of your 20th,

23:54.801 --> 23:56.969
we got something for you.

23:57.003 --> 23:59.305
It's something
we worked on together.

23:59.338 --> 24:01.908
Before you took it
for one of your B-sides.

24:01.941 --> 24:05.277
But I remixed it.
Check this out.

24:05.311 --> 24:08.180
(music playing)

24:08.214 --> 24:11.518
*

24:11.551 --> 24:12.785
It's bangin', right?

24:15.522 --> 24:17.089
-(speaks indistinctly)
-(screams)

24:17.123 --> 24:18.925
-No.
-(screams)

24:18.958 --> 24:19.959
-No. -(gunshot)

24:19.992 --> 24:21.160
No! No!

24:22.562 --> 24:23.796
-No!
-Dad.

24:23.830 --> 24:26.098
-No. -Wait, Dad.
No, Webb, grab him, man.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.166
What's wrong with him?

24:27.199 --> 24:28.868
Man, get your damn hands off me.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.469
He slow now, huh?

24:34.040 --> 24:36.175
A few things. I need you
to get my mom's signature

24:36.208 --> 24:38.645
and, uh, make sure Morales
in Accounts Payable gets cc'd.

24:38.678 --> 24:40.680
Okay? Thank you.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.963
Who let you in here?

24:56.996 --> 25:00.166
Get it right, Mr. Lyon,
I'm NYPD,

25:00.199 --> 25:03.135
not Vegas po-po
you can keep off your ass

25:03.169 --> 25:05.071
with a couple of tickets
to The Lion King.

25:10.677 --> 25:13.312
You said Giuliana Green
is in hiding because

25:13.345 --> 25:14.914
she's afraid of your father.

25:14.947 --> 25:18.317
Now, I take it your father is
a pretty scary guy.

25:18.350 --> 25:22.088
But how about you?

25:22.121 --> 25:24.624
Are you scary... Andre?

25:29.962 --> 25:33.032
Next time we speak,

25:33.065 --> 25:35.067
I think it's best
my attorney be present.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.576
Know the difference between
fear and excitement?

25:45.444 --> 25:48.615
It's all in how your brain
interprets it.

25:48.648 --> 25:51.050
Earlier today, when you heard
the uniforms

25:51.083 --> 25:52.418
coming around the corner,

25:52.451 --> 25:54.020
were you afraid we were going
to get caught?

25:54.053 --> 25:55.554
Caught?

25:55.588 --> 25:58.424
Well, see, I wasn't.

25:58.457 --> 25:59.992
It made me hot.

26:07.333 --> 26:09.936
(door shuts)

26:14.440 --> 26:16.976
Just the way you like it.

26:17.009 --> 26:20.479
You promise?
(chuckles)

26:20.512 --> 26:23.082
Thanks, Juanita.

26:25.484 --> 26:28.821
It's like that fellow,
Moonshine...

26:28.855 --> 26:32.792
I looked in his eye
and I could see that he was

26:32.825 --> 26:35.127
a violent, violent man.

26:35.161 --> 26:39.431
And I knew that him and I had
some kind of history.

26:39.465 --> 26:41.634
He was looking for it
in my eyes.

26:41.668 --> 26:44.270
Is that what drove my music?

26:44.303 --> 26:46.505
Was it dark?

26:46.538 --> 26:50.810
Was I a violent man like him?

26:52.645 --> 26:56.482
I mean, I know you guys are
trying to protect me, but...

26:56.515 --> 26:59.285
it seems like y'all are trying
to protect me from me.

27:06.125 --> 27:09.595
When I was six years old,
you threw me in a trash can.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.698
I what?

27:13.165 --> 27:15.167
It was a party,

27:15.201 --> 27:18.304
and I came downstairs
in Mom's heels

27:18.337 --> 27:20.106
and scarf or whatever.

27:20.139 --> 27:23.442
And a lot of the, you know, like
friends and family were over,

27:23.475 --> 27:24.543
so it freaked you out.

27:24.576 --> 27:26.145
I was intolerant?

27:26.178 --> 27:30.016
(laughs) Yeah, that's a nice way
of saying it, yeah.

27:30.049 --> 27:34.687
That's... (sighs)

27:34.721 --> 27:38.024
a hateful, ugly thing
to do to somebody.

27:38.057 --> 27:40.860
I rejected you for who you are.

27:40.893 --> 27:43.896
That's wrong.
It's...

27:43.930 --> 27:46.733
it's hateful.

27:46.766 --> 27:48.634
I mean, it wasn't easy,

27:48.667 --> 27:52.839
and, you know, I spent some time
hating you, but...

27:54.006 --> 27:55.341
Dad, you were a product--

27:55.374 --> 27:57.643
a product of, you know,
where you grew up.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.545
No, no, no, there's
no excuse for that.

27:59.578 --> 28:00.980
I mean, here I was,

28:01.013 --> 28:04.884
unable to see
my own son because...

28:04.917 --> 28:07.586
of some prejudice I had.

28:09.856 --> 28:11.357
I'm so sorry.

28:14.927 --> 28:18.831
Dad, it's okay,
as long as you see me now.

28:18.865 --> 28:19.966
And you do.

28:22.769 --> 28:24.737
Thank you for trusting me
with the truth.

28:24.771 --> 28:27.239
Yeah.
(chuckles)

28:37.483 --> 28:39.485
(indistinct chatter)

28:41.420 --> 28:43.890
Nice of you
to have it all ready.

28:43.923 --> 28:44.891
That kind of day, huh?

28:44.924 --> 28:46.558
You have no idea.

28:46.592 --> 28:48.360
Don't worry,
we'll get you glammed up.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.396
Annie is just getting some
compositions up with the others.

28:50.429 --> 28:52.364
-Okay.
-WOMAN: Yeah.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.633
(indistinct chatter
and laughter)

28:54.666 --> 28:57.203
Cookie, darling.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.938
How nice to see you.

29:01.607 --> 29:04.877
* They call me Hakeem
Triple Beam Money Green Lyon *

29:04.911 --> 29:07.880
* If ya ain't for my team,
need to be quiet *

29:07.914 --> 29:09.648
* Gimme that money
and run it, hey *

29:09.681 --> 29:11.417
* I punch you right
in the stomach, hey *

29:11.450 --> 29:13.385
* I only keep it 100, I'm aiming
it right at your head like a *

29:13.419 --> 29:15.087
-(gunshot)
-* This the theme song

29:15.121 --> 29:16.655
-(Bella crying)
-* Beat on my chest, King Kong

29:16.688 --> 29:18.958
* Tell me, what the hell
is your empire *

29:18.991 --> 29:20.226
* Without me to lean on?

29:20.259 --> 29:21.593
-* Nowadays I'm way, way...
-Hey.

29:21.627 --> 29:23.062
Hey, hey, hey.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.496
Babe, what you think of this?

29:24.530 --> 29:25.731
Be careful, Keem.

29:25.764 --> 29:26.899
HAKEEM: Come on,
you know I'm not gonna curse

29:26.933 --> 29:28.000
in front of Bella.

29:28.034 --> 29:29.435
(knock on door)

29:29.468 --> 29:30.803
Zoe, you mind getting that
for me?

29:33.272 --> 29:35.407
Hello.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.409
Mama's here.

29:37.443 --> 29:41.113
(singsongy): Look at my pretty,
little princess.

29:41.147 --> 29:43.115
(laughs) Hi.

29:43.149 --> 29:45.484
HAKEEM:
Hey, Anika.

29:45.517 --> 29:48.087
Hey. You coming home with Mama
tonight, right?

29:48.120 --> 29:49.288
Yes.

29:49.321 --> 29:51.290
HAKEEM:
Going where?

29:51.323 --> 29:53.826
She's coming home
with me tonight.

29:53.860 --> 29:55.494
Right?

29:55.527 --> 29:56.595
She's not going with you
anywhere, Anika.

29:56.628 --> 29:57.596
-Excuse me?
-(Bella cries)

29:57.629 --> 29:58.764
She has a play date tomorrow

29:58.797 --> 30:00.632
and I have to take her shopping
for her birthday.

30:00.666 --> 30:02.869
That's okay, I will take her.

30:02.902 --> 30:04.136
I mean, Lucious want me
to bring her over there.

30:04.170 --> 30:05.838
You were just over there today,
right?

30:05.872 --> 30:09.141
Ah, you are a terrible liar,
Hakeem.

30:09.175 --> 30:11.043
Oh, come to Mama. Come.

30:11.077 --> 30:12.511
She's on a routine now.

30:12.544 --> 30:14.280
Babies is supposed
to be on that. Right, T?

30:14.313 --> 30:17.216
(Bella crying)

30:21.487 --> 30:22.554
Come, come...

30:22.588 --> 30:24.190
Oh, oh, come here.

30:24.223 --> 30:26.125
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

30:26.158 --> 30:27.994
HAKEEM:
See? She's not used to you yet.

30:28.027 --> 30:30.829
Got to give her some time.

30:30.863 --> 30:33.532
You were gone five months.

30:33.565 --> 30:36.402
And your mother was gone
for 17 years, Hakeem,

30:36.435 --> 30:37.636
but she is still your mother.

30:37.669 --> 30:40.072
And I am still Bella's.

30:40.106 --> 30:43.209
Now, she might not remember...

30:43.242 --> 30:45.211
but you better not forget.

30:47.113 --> 30:48.580
WOMAN:
Didn't her stylist get the memo?

30:48.614 --> 30:50.349
WOMAN 2: Turned down
for a line of credit.

30:50.382 --> 30:51.650
Poor thing.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.485
WOMAN 3:
But the company is solid.

30:53.519 --> 30:56.522
DIANA: That's rap.
Black pathology always sells.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.057
WOMAN 3:
Wasn't she with your son?

30:58.090 --> 30:59.926
WOMAN 2:
Doesn't have a degree, does she?

30:59.959 --> 31:01.860
Oh, not even an education,
except for federal prison.

31:01.894 --> 31:03.595
Diana.

31:03.629 --> 31:06.899
You have something
you need to say to me?

31:06.933 --> 31:10.836
Right here.
You can say it to my face.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.772
I was just talking to my friends
about the recidivism rates.

31:13.805 --> 31:17.376
I'm a firm believer that as long
as people resort to crime

31:17.409 --> 31:21.914
and violence to solve problems,
that, well,

31:21.948 --> 31:23.882
I'm sure I don't have
to tell you

31:23.916 --> 31:26.385
about the vicious cycle thing.

31:26.418 --> 31:28.420
CHYNA:
Yo, Cookie.

31:28.454 --> 31:30.556
Cookie, right?

31:35.094 --> 31:36.128
What do you want?

31:37.396 --> 31:40.632
Uh, ladies, you about ready?

31:44.136 --> 31:46.372
I should've known how a new jack
would respond to a gift

31:46.405 --> 31:48.074
just out the blue like that,

31:48.107 --> 31:49.675
especially one of y'all
north Philly chicks.

31:50.842 --> 31:53.612
Look, I'm from Southwest.

31:53.645 --> 31:55.647
See that?

31:55.681 --> 31:57.749
That's Philly
every day, all day.

31:57.783 --> 31:59.451
Well, except for Ilene.

31:59.485 --> 32:03.055
She's from Camden,
but she reps hard.

32:03.089 --> 32:06.458
Anyway, look, you don't want
to be stepping barefoot

32:06.492 --> 32:08.127
in them shower stalls
with the nasty asses

32:08.160 --> 32:09.461
we got up in here, okay?

32:09.495 --> 32:12.664
I'm supposed to believe
that's it, huh?

32:12.698 --> 32:16.735
Oh, we got lotion.
Baby powder. Stamps.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.005
Write your peeps,
let 'em know you're good.

32:19.038 --> 32:21.507
Just until you get money on your
books and can get your own.

32:21.540 --> 32:23.609
Just put a little bit back
in the stash for the next chick.

32:23.642 --> 32:24.643
Know what I mean?

32:26.778 --> 32:28.914
So, how many years you get?
Oh, no, don't tell me.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.116
Conspiracy,

32:30.149 --> 32:33.685
new law, you got more than ten,
that's for sure.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.689
-Thirty.
-Hmm.

32:37.723 --> 32:39.191
Thirty.

32:39.225 --> 32:41.693
So you'll be doing, what?

32:41.727 --> 32:44.463
25 and a half?

32:44.496 --> 32:46.598
You see Ashanti over there,
that skinny one?

32:46.632 --> 32:47.833
She got 30.

32:47.866 --> 32:51.537
LaDonna, she got life.

32:51.570 --> 32:54.273
Not one of 'em
got less than ten.

32:54.306 --> 32:57.043
I'm-a let you guess how many
of them are not in here

32:57.076 --> 32:59.811
because of their man.

33:01.013 --> 33:03.215
What about you?
Where your man at?

33:03.249 --> 33:06.518
Out there on the streets.

33:06.552 --> 33:08.720
My man was a don.

33:08.754 --> 33:10.522
You heard of him, trust me.

33:10.556 --> 33:13.192
Talking that
"get down or lay down."

33:13.225 --> 33:17.129
Feds ran up on him,
he laid his ass down.

33:17.163 --> 33:19.698
What man?

33:19.731 --> 33:22.334
I'm in here with you and them.

33:22.368 --> 33:25.704
We live together
or we die alone.

33:26.705 --> 33:29.808
-ANNIE: And right here.
-I'm sorry.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.243
I-I got to say something.

33:32.211 --> 33:33.312
I'm sorry.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.081
Um, look, it's no secret

33:35.114 --> 33:37.716
that there's bad blood
between us.

33:37.749 --> 33:40.252
But I'd like
to put that behind us,

33:40.286 --> 33:41.553
because I have
so many other things

33:41.587 --> 33:42.721
I need to be concerned with.

33:44.290 --> 33:46.024
(sighs)

33:46.058 --> 33:48.494
I got turned down
for a line of credit today.

33:48.527 --> 33:51.263
Every "T" was crossed,
every "I" was dotted.

33:51.297 --> 33:53.065
Should've been a shoo-in, but...

33:53.099 --> 33:55.701
before I could get
a "how do you do, ma'am?"

33:55.734 --> 33:58.537
that bougie-ass banker
told me to kick rocks.

33:58.570 --> 34:02.040
Look, I may not know business
like all of you do,

34:02.074 --> 34:06.011
but I know music,
and it's priceless.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.380
And I need to go find a bank
that understands that,

34:08.414 --> 34:10.882
-so I'm sorry. I'm so...
-The same thing happened to me.

34:12.251 --> 34:14.286
My husband had a heart attack.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.921
Left me to care
for two teenagers.

34:15.954 --> 34:18.124
My company was teetering,

34:18.157 --> 34:20.692
my job was on the line.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.594
I mean, all I needed
was a, a bridge loan

34:22.628 --> 34:24.230
to take me through the quarter.

34:24.263 --> 34:26.031
I got turned down,

34:26.064 --> 34:28.567
'cause I don't have
an appendage between my legs.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.602
(laughs)
Cookie.

34:32.638 --> 34:35.407
I'm gonna spot you $10 mil
for your 20 For 20.

34:35.441 --> 34:38.544
And not just because my kids
love your music.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.712
-$10 million?
-Mm-hmm.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.748
(laughing):
Thank you.

34:42.781 --> 34:44.883
-Count me in!
-I got you.

34:44.916 --> 34:47.219
The boys on Wall Street sure
as hell don't have our backs.

34:47.253 --> 34:49.455
We got to stick together.

34:49.488 --> 34:53.492
Now come take one of these
flicks with us, new jack.

34:56.762 --> 34:58.764
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

35:00.266 --> 35:01.733
I guess I'm staying.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.435
Fire that camera up.

35:03.469 --> 35:05.471
(laughs)
Thank you.

35:05.504 --> 35:07.839
That's girl power.

35:07.873 --> 35:10.842
I am impressed.

35:10.876 --> 35:13.044
You were clearly
the better woman today.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.115
And you're right.

35:17.149 --> 35:20.986
It's time that we put
these hostilities behind us.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.627
-Ma'am.
-Thank you, Charles.

35:32.063 --> 35:34.032
* When she drop it low,
when she drop it low *

35:34.065 --> 35:36.001
* When-When-When
she drop it low *

35:36.034 --> 35:39.004
* Drip, drop,
drip, drippity drop... *

35:39.037 --> 35:41.940
Delicious in its irony,
eh, cousin?

35:41.973 --> 35:44.176
Turn that trash off.

35:44.210 --> 35:45.811
(music stops)

35:45.844 --> 35:47.546
You'll be glad to know,

35:47.579 --> 35:50.816
I separated Cookie, the fool,
from her money.

35:50.849 --> 35:53.452
Drive.

35:53.485 --> 35:57.223
(sirens wailing, helicopter
whirring, tires screeching)

35:57.256 --> 35:59.958
(beat playing)

35:59.991 --> 36:01.327
(air horn blowing in song)

36:01.360 --> 36:02.728
Yo, Keem.

36:02.761 --> 36:05.163
It's your world.
You need to handle that.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.345
(dog barks, gun fires)

36:20.846 --> 36:23.181
* Copy that

36:23.215 --> 36:25.217
-* 100,000, let's go, baby

36:30.222 --> 36:33.659

need to be quiet *

36:33.692 --> 36:35.060
* Give me that money
and run it, hey *

36:35.093 --> 36:37.195
* I punch you right
in the stomach, hey *

36:37.229 --> 36:39.197

it right at your head like a *

36:45.537 --> 36:46.905

36:46.938 --> 36:48.774

37:52.170 --> 37:56.975
* You've got liquid gold

38:04.783 --> 38:06.752
You don't need your attorney.

38:06.785 --> 38:08.687
I'm off duty.

* There's a truth
I can't ignore... *

38:12.858 --> 38:15.961
* I spent so many years
wandering from myself *

Keep going.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.832
* Oh...

38:20.866 --> 38:22.368
Like this?

38:22.401 --> 38:26.004
* Yeah, you got it

38:26.037 --> 38:29.274
* I have never needed nobody

38:29.307 --> 38:31.309
* Nobody but you

38:33.712 --> 38:36.314
* Nobody but you

38:36.348 --> 38:39.017
* Ooh

38:39.050 --> 38:43.321
* Yeah, you got it

38:43.355 --> 38:46.324
* I have never needed nobody

38:46.358 --> 38:49.828
* Nobody but you

38:50.862 --> 38:52.898
* Nobody but you.

38:52.931 --> 38:54.866
This some hood-ass Chinese food.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.768
That's the way
it's supposed to be, you know?

38:58.737 --> 39:00.406
You all right?

39:01.440 --> 39:03.542
Yeah, I'm good.

39:06.011 --> 39:07.979
(chuckles)

39:08.013 --> 39:09.581
I'm good.

39:09.615 --> 39:12.150
Oh, Lord. Don't do that, babe.
What is it?

39:12.183 --> 39:14.820
Look.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.688
I don't know what's going on,

39:16.722 --> 39:18.690
or what the deal is
with you and your father.

39:18.724 --> 39:21.693
And it's none of my business.

39:21.727 --> 39:24.663
I just don't understand
why I haven't met him yet.

39:24.696 --> 39:26.665
'Cause I told you a million
different times, Warren,

39:26.698 --> 39:29.100
that it's-it's complicated.

39:29.134 --> 39:31.870
"It's complicated."
Come on, boy.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.872
You embarrassed of me?

39:33.905 --> 39:35.707
Are you joking? Why would
I be embarrassed of you?

39:35.741 --> 39:37.643
Well, then, are you embarrassed
of your father?

39:40.278 --> 39:42.047
I just don't understand
why we're keeping secrets,

39:42.080 --> 39:43.582
that's all.

39:43.615 --> 39:45.016
"We"?

39:45.050 --> 39:47.819
I mean, are you keeping secrets?

39:52.758 --> 39:54.125
(quietly):
All right.

39:54.159 --> 39:57.963
I got daddy issues, too.

39:57.996 --> 39:59.931
My father's an attorney.

39:59.965 --> 40:03.435
Was an attorney.

40:03.469 --> 40:07.873
(exhales) But now he's a
degenerate gambler and a drunk.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.976
I got accepted to Stanford.

40:11.009 --> 40:13.244
My father paid my tuition

40:13.278 --> 40:15.914
to a whole bunch of casinos
in Vegas.

40:18.283 --> 40:22.153
Jamal, one of the things
that made me fall hard for you

40:22.187 --> 40:26.825
is when your father
had his accident,

40:26.858 --> 40:28.460
how you loved him.

40:28.494 --> 40:32.063
I'll always wonder
what that felt like.

40:32.097 --> 40:36.267
Maybe, maybe I was just hanging
around, trying to...

40:36.301 --> 40:37.669
be a part of that.

40:37.703 --> 40:41.807
But if you don't trust me...

40:41.840 --> 40:44.209
baby, what are we doing?

40:46.978 --> 40:49.581
I do trust you, though.

40:49.615 --> 40:51.082
Warren, come on, man.

40:51.116 --> 40:54.452
Ju-- stop, stop all that.

40:56.221 --> 40:58.056
I trust you, all right?

41:00.058 --> 41:02.828
This is a lot.
And-and my....

41:02.861 --> 41:05.797
My family, we got to keep it
under wraps.

41:08.233 --> 41:10.201
My father has
a serious brain injury

41:10.235 --> 41:13.939
and he, he don't
really remember us too much

41:13.972 --> 41:16.708
and he doesn't
really remember himself.

41:22.180 --> 41:24.415
Come here.

41:28.987 --> 41:30.221
(kisses)

41:41.900 --> 41:43.501
(door closes)

41:45.537 --> 41:47.539
(spraying)

41:55.681 --> 41:58.283
Lucious, what are you doing?

41:59.918 --> 42:02.020
They're Bella's paints.

42:02.053 --> 42:04.122
(sighs)
It relaxes me.

42:07.425 --> 42:09.427
(blows)

42:09.460 --> 42:11.897
(spraying continues)

42:11.930 --> 42:14.966
All right, I'll leave you to it.

42:18.203 --> 42:20.205
(Lucious panting)

42:27.579 --> 42:30.481
Lucious, um...

42:32.217 --> 42:34.519
The reason why I was gone
for 17 years

42:34.552 --> 42:37.155
is because I was in prison.

42:45.797 --> 42:48.600
Was it because of me?

42:50.168 --> 42:53.271
Women back then,
who were in prison,

42:53.304 --> 42:55.440
they just complained
about how they were there

42:55.473 --> 42:58.176
because of their men.
(chuckles)

43:00.278 --> 43:03.782
Yeah, Lucious,
it's because of you.

43:08.419 --> 43:10.388
Good night.

43:10.421 --> 43:13.659
Um, Cookie.

43:13.692 --> 43:17.562
I'd like to hear about it.

43:17.595 --> 43:20.131
The whys and where.

43:20.165 --> 43:22.901
The reasons it was my fault.

43:22.934 --> 43:25.804
I want to know everything.

44:03.508 --> 44:04.642
Yeah.

44:04.676 --> 44:06.644
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:09.047 --> 44:11.116
Now that Empire
