09:16.223 --> 09:19.934
So, I've decided to let you
co-chair the Masquerade Party.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.686
Don't thank me now.
Just accept my offer.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.397
We have to get to work
immediately.

09:23.438 --> 09:26.066
What makes you think
I'd help you?

09:26.107 --> 09:28.193
Well, the two of us
pulling this off together

09:28.235 --> 09:31.530
would make you half of the most
powerful person on campus.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.198

at CU?

09:33.240 --> 09:35.200

an opportunity
