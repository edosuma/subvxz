better take over from here.

Come over and help us.

I've never had a Christmas

missing nothing.

and we were refused help.

The ambulance
has emergency medicine.

We didn't know what else to do.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.583
Oh, please.

blizzard come from?

08:47.708 --> 08:49.708
What about all my presents?

08:49.708 --> 08:53.125
Do not worry about them.
Now, let us go!

09:12.208 --> 09:14.000
Is this gonna take long?

09:37.875 --> 09:39.875

Or did you just come
to watch a Morlock suffer?

09:42.750 --> 09:45.708
I do not deserve that.
We have come to help.

09:45.708 --> 09:48.208
Why? You never have before.

Listen, lady,
we don't have to...

No, Wolverine.
Let Callisto speak.

09:53.416 --> 09:55.333
[groaning]

09:55.333 --> 09:57.583

will have to wait.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.333
Agreed.

10:07.875 --> 10:10.583
-[Storm] Wolverine!
-Yeah, what do you want?

10:10.583 --> 10:14.166
You have experience
in field medicine.
Prepare the child.

10:14.166 --> 10:17.500
I will fly him to the mansion
where Beast can
tend to him properly.

10:21.833 --> 10:22.958
Uh-oh.

10:23.750 --> 10:26.958
What is it? What's the matter?
Why are you just standing there?

10:33.875 --> 10:35.458
Hi, little one.

10:35.458 --> 10:37.416
[Callisto] Why don't you
make him do something?

10:38.708 --> 10:41.000
Take your hands off of me!

10:41.000 --> 10:43.458
Shut up! Both of you.

10:43.458 --> 10:45.583
We ain't taking
this kid nowhere.

10:45.583 --> 10:47.000
What do you mean?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.250
He needs immediate
medical attention!

10:49.250 --> 10:50.583
There is none here!

10:50.583 --> 10:52.708
It's too late to move him.

10:52.708 --> 10:56.583
His pulse is dropping.
He'd never survive the trip.

10:56.583 --> 10:59.333
Not survive?

10:59.333 --> 11:00.333
Leech?

11:00.333 --> 11:03.708
No! No! He can't!

11:03.708 --> 11:08.083
Not today! It's Christmas Eve!

11:11.458 --> 11:14.458
No, I will not accept it.

11:15.458 --> 11:17.625
We cannot lose him.

11:17.625 --> 11:19.875
There must be
something we can do.

11:19.875 --> 11:22.625
Wolverine, please.

11:23.875 --> 11:27.750
You're so good
at healing yourself.
Can't you help Leech?

11:27.750 --> 11:30.083
Don't be crazy. He ain't me.

11:30.708 --> 11:33.208
Logan, can you?

11:33.208 --> 11:36.000
Forget it! It's impossible!

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Can your blood
save Leech's life?

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
[Wolverine] Maybe!
There's a chance!

11:42.000 --> 11:43.833
Is that what you want me to say?

11:43.833 --> 11:46.291
You have to try, Wolverine.

11:46.291 --> 11:48.708
It's not like you not to help.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.458
Can you hate them so much?

11:51.458 --> 11:53.708
Don't you think
I want to help the kid?

11:53.708 --> 11:56.416
You have failed
trying to save others?

11:57.083 --> 12:00.208
Yeah. They looked at me, scared,

12:00.208 --> 12:02.625
hoping, like I had the answer.

12:02.625 --> 12:05.625
And I let them down.
Over 20 of them.

12:06.458 --> 12:09.958
The last one was a kid,
smaller than him.

12:09.958 --> 12:12.500
But you said, maybe.

12:12.500 --> 12:15.458
Yeah, it worked twice.

12:15.458 --> 12:17.458
Once a long time ago.

12:17.458 --> 12:18.958
I don't know why.

12:18.958 --> 12:20.833
The second time I...

12:20.833 --> 12:22.125
What's the difference?

12:22.708 --> 12:26.333
Ape! Did you get
a transfusion kit
out of that ambulance?

12:26.708 --> 12:28.250
Transfusion?

12:28.250 --> 12:29.458
Never mind.

12:33.291 --> 12:34.833
I will contact the mansion

12:34.833 --> 12:37.000
and have Rogue fly
Beast and his medical kit

12:37.000 --> 12:38.708
here immediately.

12:38.708 --> 12:42.000
Until then, Logan,
you know what you have to do.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.583
You don't know
what you're asking.

12:44.583 --> 12:49.125
I am asking you
to show the courage needed
to save a child's life!

12:49.125 --> 12:52.750
He wouldn't be dying
if you looked
after these people.

12:53.708 --> 12:55.458
Perhaps you are right.

12:56.125 --> 13:00.375
But if there is one chance
in a thousand you can help him,

13:00.375 --> 13:01.875
you must.

13:02.708 --> 13:04.458
Ask yourself, Logan.

13:04.458 --> 13:08.625
if he were your child,
would you refuse?

13:11.750 --> 13:13.583
Good. Ape!

13:14.000 --> 13:17.708
Wolverine will need
a flat surface to lie on,
right beside Leech.

13:17.708 --> 13:19.458
Ape will do it.

13:27.458 --> 13:29.375
Leech be okay?

13:29.375 --> 13:31.750
Do you believe
in miracles, Mariana?

13:31.750 --> 13:33.458
What's miracles?

13:34.083 --> 13:35.125
[sniffling]

13:37.458 --> 13:40.125
Maybe in a little while,
we'll see.

13:46.708 --> 13:48.250
[Jean] You did what?

13:48.250 --> 13:50.583
I just gave the ham
a little juicing up.

13:50.583 --> 13:56.291
I want this, this,
this swamp rat
out of my kitchen! Now!

13:57.083 --> 13:59.833
Stop it! You're both
acting like children.

13:59.833 --> 14:01.875
This is Christmas Eve, remember?

14:01.875 --> 14:04.166
Everyone, we have an emergency!

14:04.166 --> 14:09.083
Rogue, I need you to fly
Beast to the Morlock tunnels,
immediately.

14:09.083 --> 14:10.500
On my way, Professor.

14:10.500 --> 14:12.458
-Who's in trouble?
-How can we help?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.250
[Storm] Beast will
be here in 10 minutes.

14:16.833 --> 14:18.333
[Callisto] There. It's started!

14:18.333 --> 14:20.625
I pray we're in time.

14:20.625 --> 14:23.958
Please, kid. Help me out here.

14:27.416 --> 14:28.583
Leech okay now?

14:29.708 --> 14:30.708
Soon.

14:31.291 --> 14:33.458
Come! See Christmas tree!

14:36.208 --> 14:39.708
I helped make it nice.
Isn't it pretty?

14:39.708 --> 14:44.625
It's the most beautiful
Christmas tree I've ever seen.

14:44.625 --> 14:46.958
Leech found it.

14:46.958 --> 14:49.333
-Leech...
-Come on!

14:57.250 --> 14:59.750
Is this your Christmas dinner?

14:59.750 --> 15:01.208
Mm-hmm.

15:01.750 --> 15:05.458
Leech bringed it from up above,
before the cold make him sick.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.375
Will you be joining us, dearie?

15:09.375 --> 15:12.583
Please stay.
You can have some of mine.

15:12.583 --> 15:14.875
Please! I bet you're hungry.

15:14.875 --> 15:17.708
Mariana asked you
a question, Jubilee.

15:17.708 --> 15:18.708
[Jubilee] Storm!

15:20.583 --> 15:21.708
Is Leech...

15:21.708 --> 15:23.708
It is still too early to tell.

15:24.416 --> 15:26.833
Come, let us rejoin the others.

15:27.958 --> 15:31.250
How do these people keep going?
They've got nothing!

15:31.250 --> 15:34.625
You're wrong, child.
They have each other's love.

15:34.625 --> 15:37.458
As long as you are
part of a caring family,

15:37.458 --> 15:40.000
every day of the year
is Christmas.

15:40.875 --> 15:43.875
It would do all of us well
to remember that.

15:45.416 --> 15:48.750
He should be better by now.
Why hasn't it worked?

15:48.750 --> 15:50.583
I told you it wouldn't work!

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Logan, stop!

15:54.000 --> 15:55.958
Yes, I may need a hand.

15:55.958 --> 15:57.500
Hank, hurry!

15:57.500 --> 16:00.583
-Beast!
-Thank goodness.

16:01.458 --> 16:03.875
Tell us quickly. Will he live?

16:03.875 --> 16:07.500
Wolverine's recuperative powers
are nothing short of miraculous.

16:07.500 --> 16:11.000
Their mutative origins, however,
are a mystery
to medical science.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.583
And the efficacy
of their transference
is impossible to predict.

16:14.583 --> 16:18.000
Then try something else.
You're supposed to be a doctor!

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
One moment!

16:22.083 --> 16:23.333
His eyes!

16:25.750 --> 16:28.375
Welcome back
to the world of the living.

16:28.375 --> 16:31.750
Like dutiful Aeneas,
leading his people to Rome.

16:31.750 --> 16:33.958
-[exclaiming]
-[laughing]

16:33.958 --> 16:37.458
It would appear
that my face is not
the world's most reassuring.

16:39.500 --> 16:43.583
He's okay, Mariana! He's okay!

16:43.583 --> 16:45.833
Of course, he is.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.708
Give me the Scepter
of Power, Callisto.

16:54.708 --> 16:55.750
Why?

16:56.958 --> 17:01.416
As leader of the Morlocks,
I owe you no explanation.
I command it!

17:02.333 --> 17:06.250
It is your right,
but you have been
no leader to us.

17:06.250 --> 17:08.291
Kneel before me.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.333
This Scepter of Power is mine
by right of single combat.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.458
As leader of the Morlock people,

17:15.458 --> 17:18.250
I hereby relinquish

17:18.250 --> 17:22.083
all rights and title
associated with that position.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.250
What?

17:23.500 --> 17:26.583
Rise, Callisto,
and kneel no more.

17:26.875 --> 17:29.291
Before all those here assembled,

17:29.291 --> 17:32.583
I hereby grant you the Scepter,

17:32.583 --> 17:34.958
symbol of Morlock leadership,

17:34.958 --> 17:37.500
with all the rights
and responsibilities

17:37.500 --> 17:39.000
associated with it.

17:39.708 --> 17:41.500
Callisto is now

17:41.500 --> 17:45.333
the one and true leader
of all the Morlock people.

17:45.625 --> 17:47.166
What's a fella have to do to get

17:47.291 --> 17:49.333
a glass of orange juice
and a cookie around here?

17:49.333 --> 17:51.375
Make that two.

17:51.375 --> 17:52.708
[Leech] Leech hungry, too.

17:52.708 --> 17:54.458
[laughing]

17:55.000 --> 17:58.375
A good meal is exactly what
the doctor prescribes.

17:58.375 --> 18:00.833
Thanks, kid, for making it.

18:01.250 --> 18:04.375
Logan, I regret
that I was too blind

18:04.375 --> 18:07.708
to show you the compassion
you have given Leech this day.

18:08.416 --> 18:11.708
I should know better
than to question your heart.

18:12.333 --> 18:16.208
As leader of the Morlocks,
I hereby extend an invitation

18:16.208 --> 18:19.416
to all X-Men to join us
for Christmas dinner.

18:19.708 --> 18:20.708
We haven't much, but...

18:20.708 --> 18:21.708
[Jubilee] Wait!

18:22.583 --> 18:24.583
We've got plenty to eat.

18:24.583 --> 18:26.958
Half of these boxes are food!

18:26.958 --> 18:28.583
Are you sure, child?

18:29.083 --> 18:31.458
I know how much
these gifts mean to you.

18:31.458 --> 18:33.416
Well, what are you waiting for?

18:33.708 --> 18:37.000
You two don't expect me
to open all these gifts
by myself, do you?

18:40.458 --> 18:44.458
You have done something
very noble today, Jubilee.

18:44.458 --> 18:46.166
I learned from the best.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.000
[Wolverine]
She's a good kid, Storm.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Though it was not quite
the Christmas

18:50.000 --> 18:51.625
Jubilee had anticipated,

18:51.875 --> 18:55.375
I would wager
that she will find it
a memorable one.

18:55.500 --> 18:56.833
[Jubilee] [giggling]

18:56.833 --> 18:59.291
So will
a couple of cooks I know.

19:01.166 --> 19:03.250
[Gambit] What do you mean,
not eating?

19:03.250 --> 19:05.750
Gambit has spent days
on this meal!

19:05.750 --> 19:09.708
My oyster loaf! My daube glace!

19:10.125 --> 19:11.875
We could warm it up tomorrow.

19:11.875 --> 19:13.416
Warm it up?

19:13.416 --> 19:16.708
You do not warm up such a meal!

19:16.708 --> 19:19.416
Gambit does not make TV dinners!

19:20.875 --> 19:22.250
I understand.

19:22.583 --> 19:24.583
[Jubilee] I just didn't
want you to think

19:24.583 --> 19:27.416
that we wanted to be away
from you on Christmas Eve.

19:27.416 --> 19:32.125
Don't worry, Jubilee.
You all will be missed,
of course,

19:32.125 --> 19:34.875
but your generous sacrifice
indicates to me

19:34.875 --> 19:39.000
that you understand
how much more you are needed
where you are.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.708
No gift could have
made me happier, or more proud.

19:58.875 --> 20:00.208
[theme music playing]
