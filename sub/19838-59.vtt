00:04.690 --> 00:08.730
<b>Don't come any closer...</b>

00:11.110 --> 00:11.990
<b>Pouf!</b>

01:38.990 --> 01:43.990
<b>Defeat x And x Dignity</b>

01:46.590 --> 01:48.250
<b>Why?</b>

01:48.940 --> 01:53.730
<b>Had you remained silent, 
I could have killed him.</b>

01:55.040 --> 01:57.810
<b>Why are you so needlessly frightened?</b>

01:58.260 --> 02:00.060
<b>He noticed you.</b>

02:00.600 --> 02:02.800
<b>If you'd approached him with the intent to kill,</b>

02:03.260 --> 02:06.380
<b>he would have immediately attacked Komugi.</b>

02:07.990 --> 02:10.900
<b>That was a risk I didn't want to take.</b>

02:12.860 --> 02:14.340
<b>Your words baffle me.</b>

02:15.240 --> 02:18.900
<b>Isn't he sitting there because 
he wants to help that girl?</b>

02:19.350 --> 02:23.490
<b>You almost make it sound like 
he means to harm her.</b>

02:23.490 --> 02:24.530
<b>Why?</b>

02:25.090 --> 02:27.020
<b>It's none of your business.</b>

02:28.150 --> 02:29.420
<b>Shut up.</b>

02:36.460 --> 02:39.430
<b>Once I'm charged up, I'm going back to Gon.</b>

02:40.320 --> 02:42.430
<b>You go find Knuckle.</b>

02:43.140 --> 02:44.990
<b>Pouf is outside the barrier,</b>

02:45.440 --> 02:47.470
<b>so it's very likely the big guy was taken out.</b>

02:48.000 --> 02:49.180
<b>Review the situation,</b>

02:49.180 --> 02:51.450
<b>then you and Knuckle decide what 
to do, and whether to retreat.</b>

02:51.450 --> 02:53.470
<b>Wh-What about you guys?</b>

02:53.880 --> 02:56.850
<b>Once Gon is in that state, he won't budge.</b>

02:58.260 --> 03:00.200
<b>At worst, he'll trade his life for Pitou's.</b>

03:01.600 --> 03:02.700
<b>I'm kidding!</b>

03:03.300 --> 03:04.770
<b>It'll be fine.</b>

03:04.770 --> 03:07.830
<b>I've always got the magic word, "Kite"!</b>

03:08.270 --> 03:09.630
<b>I have it under control.</b>

03:10.000 --> 03:11.460
<b><i>Really?</i></b>

03:12.240 --> 03:15.620
<b><i>Then why did you</i></b>

03:17.500 --> 03:20.660
<b><i>look so sad back there?</i></b>

03:25.250 --> 03:26.910
<b><i>You're sure, then?</i></b>

03:27.960 --> 03:31.320
<b><i>You can't talk... And you don't want to, anyway.</i></b>

03:31.860 --> 03:34.400
<b><i>Then I can't ask, and I don't want to!</i></b>

03:38.310 --> 03:40.400
<b>It's none of your business.</b>

03:41.360 --> 03:42.350
<b>Shut up.</b>

03:46.910 --> 03:48.160
<b>Shut up?</b>

04:05.540 --> 04:07.930
<b><i>Downwind, huh?</i></b>

04:11.020 --> 04:12.360
<b>Am I interrupting something?</b>

04:13.100 --> 04:16.730
<b>Pitou, I'll let you handle this, then.</b>

04:17.260 --> 04:18.400
<b>Don't move.</b>

04:19.460 --> 04:20.620
<b>Stay right there.</b>

04:21.500 --> 04:24.160
<b>You can use your wing scales to control others, right?</b>

04:24.660 --> 04:26.700
<b>Don't take a single step.</b>

04:30.650 --> 04:32.430
<b>Pouf, please!</b>

04:33.240 --> 04:34.590
<b>Are you insane?</b>

04:35.430 --> 04:38.280
<b>You want me to stand here and do nothing?</b>

04:39.250 --> 04:41.000
<b>For that woman's sake?</b>

04:41.990 --> 04:43.280
<b>For the King's sake!</b>

04:45.600 --> 04:47.220
<b>Do as he says...</b>

04:51.390 --> 04:53.100
<b><i>What happened?</i></b>

04:55.190 --> 04:58.750
<b><i>Your expression has changed...</i></b>

05:00.710 --> 05:05.180
<b><i>What happened while I was trapped?</i></b>

05:12.630 --> 05:17.260
<b>I promise that I shall not move from this spot.</b>

05:17.680 --> 05:19.630
<b>In return, I want you to tell me</b>

05:20.510 --> 05:23.630
<b>everything that has happened thus far.</b>

05:27.320 --> 05:32.640
<b><i>If I ask where the King is, he'll 
get suspicious and silence us.</i></b>

05:33.470 --> 05:36.240
<b><i>Drop me hints while you explain what's happened.</i></b>

05:38.080 --> 05:41.330
<b><i>Be careful to make it sound quite natural.</i></b>

05:42.000 --> 05:45.400
<b><i>If you fail, we will see bloodshed.</i></b>

05:46.420 --> 05:48.090
<b><i>That's all there is to it.</i></b>

05:57.680 --> 05:58.780
<b>It's time.</b>

05:58.780 --> 06:00.120
<b>Adding interest.</b>

06:06.430 --> 06:07.580
<b><i>I've got it...</i></b>

06:09.070 --> 06:11.820
<b><i>I could feel myself controlling the explosion.</i></b>

06:15.140 --> 06:19.810
<b><i>If I try it once more, I'll have it mastered.</i></b>

06:20.750 --> 06:22.000
<b><i>I need rage...</i></b>

06:22.000 --> 06:25.070
<b><i>I must build up my rage before 
I forget how it felt!</i></b>

06:27.160 --> 06:30.710
<b>That's the second time you've 
made a fool out of me!</b>

06:30.710 --> 06:33.330
<b>Scum! Trash!</b>

06:33.560 --> 06:35.720
<b>Piece of crap!</b>

06:43.210 --> 06:46.010
<b><i>Stay calm, and let rage consume me...</i></b>

06:46.890 --> 06:49.340
<b><i>Create and destroy at the same time.</i></b>

06:50.460 --> 06:53.350
<b><i>Manifested through this body!</i></b>

06:53.990 --> 06:56.680
<b>Youpi had yet to notice</b>

06:57.200 --> 07:00.850
<b>why two conflicting emotions 
could exist simultaneously...</b>

07:01.710 --> 07:04.530
<b>Or what his current predicament was.</b>

07:07.510 --> 07:08.930
<b><i>Rage...</i></b>

07:09.540 --> 07:13.120
<b><i>Rage is not intended to be scattered.</i></b>

07:13.120 --> 07:15.370
<b><i>It's meant to be focused on a target!</i></b>

07:20.310 --> 07:25.250
<b>I Will Destroy You!!!</b>

07:21.450 --> 07:24.610
<b><i>I will destroy you!</i></b>

07:34.730 --> 07:36.270
<b><i>Okay! Okay!</i></b>

07:36.270 --> 07:38.310
<b><i>It's a fake, okay!</i></b>

07:38.310 --> 07:40.380
<b><i>Keep it up...</i></b>

07:40.380 --> 07:42.680
<b><i>Make me madder!</i></b>

07:42.680 --> 07:44.310
<b><i>Come on!</i></b>

07:54.930 --> 07:56.030
<b>It's time.</b>

07:56.030 --> 07:57.360
<b>Adding interest.</b>

08:00.070 --> 08:02.080
<b>APR's interest is calculated</b>

08:02.080 --> 08:05.710
<b>assuming that aura consumption will 
continue to rise at the current rate.</b>

08:05.710 --> 08:10.560
<b>Even if Youpi were to reduce his 
aura usage to a bare minimum,</b>

08:11.300 --> 08:14.140
<b>in another three minutes and fifty seconds,</b>

08:14.820 --> 08:19.180
<b>he would reach the point at which 
he would be unable to use <i>Nen</i>.</b>

08:23.290 --> 08:25.190
<b><i>Ten left.</i></b>

08:31.070 --> 08:33.360
<b><i>My back's against the wall...</i></b>

08:34.220 --> 08:38.050
<b><i>Looks like he's saving me for last.</i></b>

08:40.040 --> 08:44.580
<b><i>In that case, I'll keep fighting as long as I can!</i></b>

08:47.390 --> 08:52.130
<b>Morel had deployed all of his puppets 
close enough for Youpi to see</b>

08:52.130 --> 08:56.710
<b>so that he'd be able to monitor Youpi's movements,</b>

08:56.710 --> 09:04.770
<b>but also because he no longer had the 
strength to move his puppets around.</b>

09:06.050 --> 09:10.270
<b>If he lost his focus, the puppets would 
return to smoke and dissipate.</b>

09:11.220 --> 09:13.070
<b><i>It shouldn't be much longer...</i></b>

09:14.530 --> 09:16.660
<b><i>He has to run out of</i> Nen <i>at some point.</i></b>

09:17.370 --> 09:18.310
<b><i>But...</i></b>

09:19.670 --> 09:21.830
<b><i>But damn...</i></b>

09:22.200 --> 09:24.940
<b><i>My body and soul...</i></b>

09:24.940 --> 09:26.250
<b><i>refuse to move.</i></b>

09:27.570 --> 09:32.690
<b>At this point, Morel could not 
even will himself to stand.</b>

09:33.310 --> 09:38.250
<b>He had literally reached his limit 
even before Youpi went bankrupt.</b>

09:44.760 --> 09:47.060
<b><i>Zero left...</i></b>

09:53.050 --> 09:56.450
<b>I have something to say to you.</b>

09:57.500 --> 09:59.370
<b>Now that Youpi had learned</b>

09:59.370 --> 10:04.290
<b>how to store his rage elsewhere, 
his head was much clearer.</b>

10:09.090 --> 10:11.830
<b>You look like a little fly that's about to die.</b>

10:13.300 --> 10:14.800
<b>And yet...</b>

10:15.160 --> 10:17.050
<b>That's what makes you guys amazing.</b>

10:19.280 --> 10:23.400
<b>During the battle, Youpi had 
evolved at an alarming rate,</b>

10:23.400 --> 10:28.300
<b>increasing the gap between 
the Hunters and himself.</b>

10:28.300 --> 10:32.530
<b>Yet he had nothing but praise for the defeated.</b>

10:33.920 --> 10:37.580
<b>Given Morel's initial impression of Youpi,</b>

10:37.580 --> 10:41.500
<b>this must have been the last thing he 
expected Youpi to say in this situation.</b>

10:41.830 --> 10:49.140
<b>But Morel could honestly accept 
that this was Youpi's true nature.</b>

10:50.720 --> 10:52.500
<b>I'm not sure how to say this...</b>

10:53.090 --> 10:55.580
<b>But because you've impressed me,</b>

10:56.280 --> 10:58.030
<b>I have to be sure to kill you.</b>

10:58.430 --> 11:00.220
<b>It's only proper, I guess?</b>

11:02.850 --> 11:04.570
<b><i>This is game over.</i></b>

11:06.530 --> 11:09.660
<b>Well, I'll end this with one blow.</b>

11:09.660 --> 11:10.730
<b>Don't move.</b>

11:11.630 --> 11:15.230
<b><i>I don't think I even mind letting him</i></b>

11:15.800 --> 11:17.990
<b><i>kill me now.</i></b>

11:18.760 --> 11:19.990
<b>Bye.</b>

11:40.760 --> 11:41.870
<b><i>He disappeared?</i></b>

11:45.460 --> 11:46.260
<b><i>There's blood...</i></b>

11:47.040 --> 11:48.270
<b><i>What's going on?</i></b>

11:48.890 --> 11:51.020
<b><i>It wasn't teleportation?</i></b>

11:52.270 --> 11:55.150
<b><i>The moment I was about to cut through him,</i></b>

11:56.280 --> 11:57.650
<b><i>he disappeared.</i></b>

11:58.930 --> 12:03.760
<b><i>I thought that one of them had the 
ability to use teleportation...</i></b>

12:04.300 --> 12:06.890
<b><i>But when he disappeared, 
I didn't see anyone else.</i></b>

12:08.000 --> 12:13.920
<b><i>And I struck before he disappeared, so if 
he teleported, I shouldn't have drawn blood.</i></b>

12:14.780 --> 12:16.550
<b><i>But I was able to cut him.</i></b>

12:16.550 --> 12:18.220
<b><i>Yet I can no longer see him.</i></b>

12:18.680 --> 12:20.550
<b><i>Does that mean he only turned invisible?</i></b>

12:21.070 --> 12:22.420
<b><i>An ability to become transparent?</i></b>

12:23.620 --> 12:27.680
<b><i>If he had that ability, 
he would have used it sooner.</i></b>

12:28.470 --> 12:30.920
<b><i>Which means one of the others</i></b>

12:30.920 --> 12:34.940
<b><i>must be able to make himself 
and the rest invisible.</i></b>

12:35.460 --> 12:40.400
<b><i>And right before I connected, he tried 
to save the guy with the sunglasses.</i></b>

12:42.760 --> 12:45.450
<b><i>But I left a deep wound.</i></b>

12:58.790 --> 12:59.650
<b><i>Here he comes!</i></b>

13:00.780 --> 13:01.760
<b><i>The blood...</i></b>

13:02.440 --> 13:04.350
<b><i>Youpi can follow the blood!</i></b>

13:04.740 --> 13:08.220
<b><i>We may be invisible, but the 
blood is leaving a trail.</i></b>

13:08.790 --> 13:13.690
<b><i>If he swings that blade again, 
I'll have to get away by myself.</i></b>

13:16.060 --> 13:18.140
<b><i>I'm running out of breath...</i></b>

13:19.870 --> 13:21.480
<b><i>Damn it!</i></b>

13:30.840 --> 13:32.270
<b><i>Knuckle?!</i></b>

13:34.010 --> 13:36.120
<b><i>Why did you reveal yourself?</i></b>

13:36.670 --> 13:42.290
<b><i>Right now, your job is to stay 
hidden as long as possible!</i></b>

13:46.590 --> 13:49.340
<b>I'm done running and hiding.</b>

13:49.340 --> 13:50.640
<b>I'll face you.</b>

13:52.690 --> 13:53.640
<b>So...</b>

13:56.300 --> 13:58.150
<b>Let them escape.</b>

14:01.710 --> 14:05.650
<b>Knuckle chose to use words instead of his fists</b>

14:06.240 --> 14:10.290
<b>because Youpi's words had 
struck a chord with him.</b>

14:14.710 --> 14:16.160
<b>You're crazy.</b>

14:16.720 --> 14:19.140
<b>You can't even call that a trade-off.</b>

14:21.650 --> 14:22.980
<b>My answer</b>

14:25.620 --> 14:26.420
<b>is no.</b>

14:29.260 --> 14:30.180
<b>However...</b>

14:33.160 --> 14:36.680
<b>If you get rid of this thing, 
my answer might change.</b>

14:38.950 --> 14:42.440
<b>I'm sure this has to do with why you've 
been constantly on the run.</b>

14:43.760 --> 14:46.440
<b>Removing it will make the 
exchange more even.</b>

14:51.090 --> 14:53.450
<b>No... Don't do it!</b>

14:54.010 --> 14:57.450
<b>Knuckle, you'd better not be stupid!</b>

14:58.330 --> 15:03.460
<b>Morel's desperate cry did not reach 
Knuckle due to God's Accomplice.</b>

15:04.120 --> 15:07.970
<b>However, it did return Meleoron to his senses.</b>

15:18.680 --> 15:21.100
<b>Leave me here...</b>

15:23.050 --> 15:24.110
<b><i>You can't!</i></b>

15:24.300 --> 15:26.860
<b><i>You can't do that, Knuckle!</i></b>

15:27.330 --> 15:30.110
<b>Don't worry about me...</b>

15:31.200 --> 15:33.370
<b><i>Will you waste everything we've done?</i></b>

15:34.230 --> 15:38.450
<b><i>Everything that Morel, and Shoot...</i></b>

15:38.920 --> 15:39.870
<b><i>and you...</i></b>

15:40.120 --> 15:42.120
<b><i>have done by risking your lives!</i></b>

15:45.670 --> 15:49.780
<b>If Knuckle didn't act, the two of 
them could still fight together.</b>

15:50.130 --> 15:54.010
<b>To do that, Meleoron had to stay hidden.</b>

15:54.650 --> 15:58.460
<b>With that in mind, the decision that 
Meleoron made after leaving Morel...</b>

15:59.190 --> 16:00.270
<b>Knuckle!</b>

16:00.790 --> 16:02.020
<b><i>Knuckle!</i></b>

16:09.330 --> 16:11.030
<b>...ended up backfiring.</b>

16:12.520 --> 16:13.660
<b>Impossible...</b>

16:15.200 --> 16:18.190
<b><i>We no longer have a way...</i></b>

16:18.880 --> 16:21.290
<b><i>to defeat Youpi...</i></b>

16:21.840 --> 16:24.290
<b>Why...</b>

16:24.990 --> 16:32.330
<b>The sight of a bloody Morel had reminded 
Knuckle of Shoot, and broken him.</b>

16:35.470 --> 16:38.870
<b>Okay... I took away APR!</b>

16:39.260 --> 16:40.760
<b>Now the terms are even.</b>

16:41.420 --> 16:43.060
<b>Leave the boss alone!</b>

16:46.530 --> 16:49.090
<b>Fight me!</b>

16:49.090 --> 16:51.320
<b>Kill me!</b>

16:57.450 --> 16:58.700
<b>No way.</b>

17:01.420 --> 17:02.510
<b>Hold on!</b>

17:02.510 --> 17:03.710
<b>Where are you going?!</b>

17:05.340 --> 17:07.750
<b>To the King, obviously.</b>

17:08.880 --> 17:11.000
<b>Do you want to come with me?</b>

17:11.000 --> 17:12.460
<b>I doubt you could handle it.</b>

17:14.040 --> 17:17.470
<b>His ability isn't teleportation, is it?</b>

17:19.230 --> 17:23.120
<b>Then you'll have to carry the 
guy in sunglasses to a doctor,</b>

17:23.120 --> 17:25.730
<b>or you struck this deal for nothing.</b>

17:29.480 --> 17:32.520
<b>If protecting the King was his first priority,</b>

17:32.520 --> 17:35.200
<b>he should have killed all three on the spot.</b>

17:38.900 --> 17:40.280
<b>It's no big deal...</b>

17:40.790 --> 17:45.250
<b>You weaklings can attack me all you 
want, but I'll still shake you off.</b>

17:46.200 --> 17:50.170
<b>The fact that he was aware of this, 
but didn't carry it out,</b>

17:50.170 --> 17:54.330
<b>irritated Youpi on a level that didn't 
compare to his previous rage.</b>

17:56.060 --> 17:57.810
<b>Come for me whenever you want.</b>

17:57.810 --> 18:00.260
<b>I'll fight you as equals.</b>

18:01.730 --> 18:03.560
<b>I don't need to kill you right now...</b>

18:04.410 --> 18:06.210
<b>And that's all there is to it!</b>

18:08.280 --> 18:11.150
<b><i>Damn, I picked up Pouf's habit.</i></b>

18:12.450 --> 18:16.820
<b>During this battle, Youpi had learned 
how profound <i>Nen</i> really was.</b>

18:17.230 --> 18:21.190
<b>That also altered what little 
sense of self he'd had before.</b>

18:21.540 --> 18:26.990
<b>Having learned to quarantine 
his rage and stay calm,</b>

18:26.990 --> 18:30.670
<b>Youpi had lost his ability to 
see things in simple terms.</b>

18:36.460 --> 18:39.380
<b><i>They're responsible for the rage I've built up,</i></b>

18:39.380 --> 18:43.380
<b><i>so why don't I feel like using it on them?</i></b>

18:45.670 --> 18:51.510
<b><i>What, or who, am I supposed 
to unleash this rage upon?</i></b>

18:53.570 --> 18:55.420
<b>Was this a sign of maturation?</b>

18:56.340 --> 18:58.290
<b>Youpi wasn't sure.</b>

18:59.960 --> 19:02.450
<b>However, as for Knuckle...</b>

19:08.210 --> 19:12.150
<b><i>I completely lost...</i></b>

19:13.560 --> 19:14.590
<b>Knuckle!</b>

19:16.800 --> 19:18.340
<b>We gotta help the big guy!</b>

19:22.560 --> 19:23.910
<b>Come on, boss.</b>

19:26.360 --> 19:30.600
<b>I told you to leave me here...</b>

19:31.700 --> 19:32.860
<b>Go!</b>

19:34.230 --> 19:36.680
<b>The two of you...</b>

19:37.100 --> 19:38.450
<b>can still fight.</b>

19:40.080 --> 19:42.360
<b>Do what you can.</b>

19:43.590 --> 19:46.730
<b>He said to go whenever you want.</b>

19:47.290 --> 19:49.630
<b>So go now!</b>

19:52.010 --> 19:53.150
<b>I can't.</b>

19:55.010 --> 19:59.960
<b>I can no longer think of him...</b>

19:59.960 --> 20:03.390
<b>as a target to destroy.</b>

20:05.130 --> 20:06.390
<b>Wait...</b>

20:07.440 --> 20:10.420
<b>He acknowledged our efforts.</b>

20:11.510 --> 20:13.360
<b>He wasn't a bad guy.</b>

20:15.520 --> 20:18.900
<b>In that case, I no longer have...</b>

20:19.440 --> 20:21.430
<b>any reason to defeat him.</b>

20:22.180 --> 20:23.410
<b>The King...</b>

20:25.520 --> 20:26.660
<b>Knov-san!</b>

20:29.130 --> 20:31.410
<b>The soldiers are not important.</b>

20:31.980 --> 20:36.210
<b>If the King waves his baton, the soldiers 
will become demons if necessary.</b>

20:38.010 --> 20:39.740
<b>I'll take care of Morel...</b>

20:39.740 --> 20:41.430
<b>Shoot is also okay.</b>

20:44.550 --> 20:46.530
<b>Are you guys also coming?</b>

20:46.530 --> 20:49.900
<b>Wait, let me sock this baby hard.</b>

20:49.900 --> 20:52.690
<b>I received a message from 
the chairman's messenger.</b>

20:54.650 --> 20:57.940
<b>As planned, he was able to take the 
King to the appointed location.</b>

20:59.330 --> 21:03.690
<b>If they leave now, the Royal 
Guard won't make it in time.</b>

21:03.690 --> 21:07.130
<b>Their job is done, and so is ours.</b>

21:09.620 --> 21:10.720
<b>Where's Palm?</b>

21:10.720 --> 21:12.080
<b>We don't know yet.</b>

21:12.080 --> 21:13.260
<b>Okay...</b>

21:15.210 --> 21:16.460
<b>What will you do?</b>

21:16.780 --> 21:19.930
<b>I don't know if I'll be back again.</b>

21:19.930 --> 21:21.840
<b>You can see how bad I look...</b>

21:23.150 --> 21:26.340
<b>Are you going or staying?</b>

21:26.840 --> 21:28.220
<b>We're staying.</b>

21:28.220 --> 21:30.180
<b>We still have a job to do.</b>

21:30.650 --> 21:31.850
<b>I see.</b>

21:36.770 --> 21:38.020
<b>You're strong...</b>

21:44.100 --> 21:45.120
<b>Let's go.</b>

21:45.630 --> 21:47.340
<b>To look for Palm?</b>

21:47.710 --> 21:49.710
<b>No, we can do that later.</b>

21:50.550 --> 21:52.240
<b>There's something else we have to do.</b>

21:57.370 --> 22:00.310
<b>Youpi isn't the only Royal Guard!</b>

23:24.420 --> 23:26.630
<b>Next time: Pose x And x Name.</b>

23:26.630 --> 23:28.730
<b>Hey, Killua... Say my name.</b>

23:28.730 --> 23:30.350
<b>Huh? Why now?</b>

23:30.350 --> 23:31.770
<b>Just do it!</b>

23:32.140 --> 23:33.140
<b>Gon.</b>

23:33.140 --> 23:34.140
<b>Killua.</b>
