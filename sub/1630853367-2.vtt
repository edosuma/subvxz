00:53.800 --> 00:55.280
Pablo?

01:02.800 --> 01:04.640
Your Italian foster mother

01:04.800 --> 01:08.160
told me something happened
at school yesterday.

01:10.240 --> 01:11.680
She said the teacher
called her in

01:11.840 --> 01:14.560
because you attacked
another child.

01:19.240 --> 01:21.760
Was it for fun, Pablo?

01:25.120 --> 01:26.560
I thought not.

01:28.040 --> 01:31.240
Because it's not fun
hurting people, is it?

01:32.440 --> 01:33.920
It's scary.

01:43.640 --> 01:44.960
Hey!

01:45.120 --> 01:46.240
Did she do something to you,

01:46.400 --> 01:48.160
the girl you attacked?

01:49.040 --> 01:50.680
I tripped and fell.

01:50.840 --> 01:52.240
She laughed.

01:52.400 --> 01:53.960
So I hit her.

02:00.440 --> 02:03.000
Have you been hurt before?

03:51.040 --> 03:54.800
What the hell are you
doing now, Salvatore?

03:54.960 --> 03:57.600
You didn't tell me you were
gonna tear a bloody wall down.

04:06.960 --> 04:08.280
Hey, Luca.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.720
How's it going?

04:11.880 --> 04:14.160
Well, Papa said it's the worst
property he's ever worked on.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.840
Oh, really?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.880
Yeah, but he said
that about every job.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.720
But this one...

04:19.880 --> 04:21.680
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

04:21.840 --> 04:23.280
Oh, dear.

04:26.080 --> 04:28.080
It'll be worth it
when it's finished.

04:28.240 --> 04:30.080
I'll be too old
to enjoy it by then.

04:30.240 --> 04:32.360
Well, maybe it's time
to admit defeat.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.120
What does that mean?

04:34.280 --> 04:36.400
That I should just give up
and go back to London?

04:36.560 --> 04:37.840
It's a bit late to say that now!

04:38.000 --> 04:39.920
No, I mean,
come and stay with us.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.760
We've got bags of room,
now Alice has gone.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.200
Sorry.

04:44.280 --> 04:45.680
And thank you, but...

04:45.840 --> 04:47.240
I'm fine here, honestly.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.600
Come on.
You need a coffee.

04:51.320 --> 04:53.440
And a shower.

05:04.240 --> 05:06.120
-Mm.
-Better?

05:06.280 --> 05:08.320
-Much.
-It'll be alright.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.600
You just have to relax and let
the Zampas do it their way.

05:10.760 --> 05:12.760
-You make it sound so easy.
-Well...

05:12.920 --> 05:15.280
Cappuccino, por favore.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.120
-What are you doing?
-Shh!

05:20.840 --> 05:22.400
Sylvia Fox?

05:25.520 --> 05:28.000
What on earth are you
doing here?

05:28.160 --> 05:30.640
-Mallory?
-Mallory Bell.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.200
Sylvia and I were at Cambridge
together, many moons ago.

05:33.360 --> 05:36.680
-Isabel, Sylvia's sister.
-Really?

05:36.840 --> 05:38.080
She talked a lot
about her parents.

05:38.240 --> 05:40.560
She's never mentioned a sister.

05:40.720 --> 05:42.640
Well, what are you doing here?
Are you here on holiday?

05:42.800 --> 05:45.080
-Isabel lives here.
-Well, so does Sylvia now.

05:45.240 --> 05:47.200
She just bought a house
outside the village.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.640
Well, it's more
of a building site.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.120
Not fit for human habitation.

05:51.280 --> 05:53.120
Oh, don't worry,
I'm staying up at the castle.

05:53.280 --> 05:56.200
Really? I didn't think
anyone lived there now.

05:56.360 --> 05:58.240
Not since the old Marchese died.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.920
Just the housekeeper.

06:00.080 --> 06:01.840
I mean, it's all a bit dusty
and moth-eaten,

06:02.000 --> 06:03.760
but I like to be on the spot.

06:03.920 --> 06:04.960
On the spot?

06:05.120 --> 06:06.760
I'm an archaeologist.

06:06.920 --> 06:09.120
I've been trying to get
into the Monterosa for years.

06:09.280 --> 06:10.480
And their owner has
finally given me

06:10.640 --> 06:12.280
permission to dig
in the grounds.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.880
What are you looking for?

06:14.040 --> 06:16.360
The Monterosa belonged
to the Knights Templar

06:16.520 --> 06:18.400
of the early Middle Ages.

06:18.560 --> 06:21.040
Their chapel would be
a major find.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.320
-Fascinating.
-Mm.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.120
And how's life with you?

06:25.280 --> 06:27.880
I heard you were doing great
things at the Foreign Office.

06:28.040 --> 06:30.960
I'm taking a bit of
a career break, actually.

06:31.120 --> 06:32.640
Thought you'd be
an Ambassador by now.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.320
Well, I must push on.
I've lots to do.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.080
Oh, please, let me.

06:38.240 --> 06:39.920
Oh, how kind.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.320
Well, let's meet up.

06:41.480 --> 06:43.080
Give me a pen
and I'll give you my number.

06:43.240 --> 06:46.440
Oh, why not let Sylvia put her
number straight in your phone?

06:46.600 --> 06:48.320
That way you won't lose it.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.640
Yes.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.040
There you go.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.000
Excellent.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.680
Well, thank you for the coffee.

07:01.840 --> 07:04.320
It's lovely to meet you,
Annabel.

07:04.480 --> 07:05.680
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

07:05.840 --> 07:07.280
Bye, Mallory.

07:10.280 --> 07:12.960
Thanks very much, Annabel.

07:13.120 --> 07:14.840
Why did you have to tell her
I live here?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.160
Why didn't you tell your
smart Cambridge friend

07:17.320 --> 07:19.480
you had a sister?

07:19.640 --> 07:22.240
I wouldn't call Mallory
a friend, exactly.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.800
More an unavoidable
fact of life.

07:31.840 --> 07:35.400
Could I have
six pistachio cannoli and, um...

07:35.560 --> 07:36.720
Oh, and those look delicious.

07:36.880 --> 07:38.640
Could I have six of those,
please?

07:53.280 --> 07:54.640
Seriously?

07:54.800 --> 07:56.120
Signora.

09:27.440 --> 09:29.800
I couldn't think
who else to call.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.280
What did they take?

09:34.440 --> 09:37.560
Tools, equipment,
waterproof clothing.

09:37.720 --> 09:39.840
It'll all have to be replaced.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.440
It's not good, is it?

09:51.600 --> 09:54.200
"Fuck off foreign
grave diggers."

09:54.360 --> 09:56.000
Oh, Mallory, I'm sorry.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.800
-Signora.
-Oh, God.

09:57.960 --> 09:59.480
It's Elena, the housekeeper.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.520
She's like my mother,
only worse.

10:04.720 --> 10:07.960
-Who did this?
-We don't know, SignoraDecone.

10:09.160 --> 10:10.400
This is my friend Sylvia.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.040
She lives in Panicale.

10:12.200 --> 10:13.640
I've never seen her.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.600
My sister is married
to the medico.

10:15.760 --> 10:18.400
-Matteo Vitale?
-Ah.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.960
God rest Marchese's soul.

10:23.120 --> 10:26.360
This would never have
happened in his time.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.160
Maybe you should go
to the Carabinieri?

10:28.320 --> 10:30.080
No. It's vandalism, that's all.

10:30.240 --> 10:32.040
Kids with nothing better to do.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.080
Has there been something else?

10:34.240 --> 10:36.200
Couple of nasty letters.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.400
-Can I see them?
-Well, I've destroyed them.

10:38.560 --> 10:41.560
That's what you do
with poison pens, isn't it?

10:41.720 --> 10:43.200
-Signora Decone...
-Mm?

10:43.360 --> 10:45.480
Could you lend us
some scrubbing brushes?

10:57.640 --> 10:59.600
So you came here for a wedding,

10:59.760 --> 11:01.840
you went for a run,
and you've seen an old ruin

11:02.000 --> 11:04.120
and you decided to buy it,
just like that?

11:04.280 --> 11:06.000
-Pretty much.
-God!

11:06.160 --> 11:09.600
Sounds like the plot
of a chick-lit novel.

11:09.760 --> 11:11.160
It's obviously left you
strapped for cash.

11:11.320 --> 11:13.320
I mean, you don't even
have a car.

11:18.640 --> 11:19.720
Are you still at Exeter?

11:19.880 --> 11:21.080
No, I've been at Marlowe Hill

11:21.240 --> 11:22.880
for a couple of years.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.000
It's a private college
in North Carolina.

11:25.160 --> 11:27.440
Very wealthy and prestigious.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.600
I'm in line
for a full professorship.

11:29.760 --> 11:30.760
Oh, congratulations.

11:30.920 --> 11:32.920
Thank you.

11:33.080 --> 11:35.720
The Templars came here in 1120,

11:35.880 --> 11:39.440
which makes this the oldest
Templar foundation in Italy.

11:48.200 --> 11:51.480
There was a report of graffiti
on a historic landmark.

11:51.640 --> 11:54.280
Yes, we've been cleaning it off.

11:54.440 --> 11:56.280
Mm. You are the foreign
archaeologist?

11:56.440 --> 11:57.920
-No, I am.
-Ah.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.200
May I see your permit?

11:59.360 --> 12:01.120
Oh, yes.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.360
Here it is.

12:13.600 --> 12:17.680
This should have been
presented at the Town Hall

12:17.840 --> 12:19.560
before the works commenced.

12:19.720 --> 12:21.680
I'll sort it out
as soon as I can.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.080
Who's he?

12:28.240 --> 12:29.680
His name's Bevilacqua.

12:29.840 --> 12:31.360
He's a Vigile Urbano.

12:31.520 --> 12:34.400
A glorified traffic warden,
basically.

12:34.560 --> 12:37.880
But you probably shouldn't
get on the wrong side of him.

12:38.040 --> 12:38.800
What, he's got a right side?

12:51.520 --> 12:53.480
Mm, smells delicious.
What is it?

12:53.640 --> 12:55.680
Ossobuco alla Milanese.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.880
Where did you learn to cook it?

12:58.040 --> 12:59.560
I found the recipe online.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.840
Only a little for me.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.520
Mama.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.280
Only a lot for me.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.080
Mm.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.200
Mm. Sorry.

13:23.360 --> 13:24.600
I'm starving.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.080
Mallory doesn't do lunch beaks.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.080
Ah, I see.

13:28.240 --> 13:31.560
But it was good of you
to help your friend out,

13:31.720 --> 13:33.160
but do you have
to go back tomorrow?

13:33.320 --> 13:35.000
Especially as you
can't stand her.

13:35.160 --> 13:37.040
I've never been on a dig before.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.440
And it gets me out of the house.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.760
And?

13:41.360 --> 13:44.720
And someone seems
to want to stop Mallory.

13:44.880 --> 13:47.760
-I want to find out why.
-Mm.

13:47.920 --> 13:50.000
Did you meet old Elena
at the castle?

13:50.160 --> 13:51.320
Mm.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.240
She seemed a bit
stuck in the past.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.800
The past is all she knows.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.200
She's part of the
curse of that place.

13:58.360 --> 14:01.280
Mm.
Elena's family helped the Nazis

14:01.440 --> 14:03.920
loot the castle's
treasures in 1944.

14:04.080 --> 14:07.000
Everything was shipped to Berlin
and they went with it.

14:07.160 --> 14:11.040
So Elena dedicated her life
to try and atone for them.

14:13.480 --> 14:18.480
Mm. This is not bad,
for foreign food.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.400
Foreign means not from Umbria.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.320
Or not from Panicale,
if Mama's having a bad day.

15:31.160 --> 15:32.320
You're late.

15:32.480 --> 15:34.440
We started hours ago.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.480
Dock it from my wages.

15:56.680 --> 15:59.200
You really love this, don't you?

15:59.360 --> 16:01.320
It's all I've ever wanted to do.

16:27.080 --> 16:28.600
Mallory!

16:40.080 --> 16:42.040
Oh, my God.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.240
This could be
a Templar graveyard.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.280
I hope you're right.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.800
But if there's even a chance
that it might be a recent burial

16:48.960 --> 16:50.280
we have to tell the Carabinieri.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.120
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

16:52.280 --> 16:54.560
I'm gonna tell them
unless you are.

16:54.720 --> 16:56.920
No. It'll just mean
pointless delays.

16:57.080 --> 16:59.880
I'm sorry, Mallory,
but we have to report it.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.520
I am in charge here!

17:24.280 --> 17:25.680
I should have guessed
when they said

17:25.840 --> 17:27.800
an English woman
had found the body.

17:27.960 --> 17:29.560
This one was in the ground.

17:29.720 --> 17:31.120
You dug it up?

17:31.280 --> 17:33.160
Not all of it.
Just the hand.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.440
Hmm.

17:48.440 --> 17:52.720
So, the body appears to be
lying in a shallow grave.

17:52.880 --> 17:53.880
Do you know how old?

17:54.040 --> 17:55.800
No, too soon to say.

17:55.960 --> 17:58.520
The pathologist has
uncovered more bones.

17:58.680 --> 18:01.000
He thinks the remains
are female.

18:01.160 --> 18:03.560
So, not a Templar Knight then?

18:03.720 --> 18:06.160
Oh, the exhumation...

18:06.320 --> 18:08.400
will take a couple of days,
I think, at least.

18:08.560 --> 18:09.960
Days?

18:10.120 --> 18:12.440
What about my work?

18:12.600 --> 18:14.120
I'm sorry, Signora.

18:14.280 --> 18:17.040
Your dig is a potential
crime scene, Mallory.

18:23.680 --> 18:25.920
Well, you were right to call us.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.520
Thank you.

18:27.680 --> 18:29.680
Did Mallory tell you
about the graffiti

18:29.840 --> 18:32.240
and the vandalizing
of her equipment?

18:32.400 --> 18:34.040
And the anonymous letters?

18:34.200 --> 18:35.400
No.

18:40.840 --> 18:43.240
Do you think someone was trying
to stop her finding the body?

18:43.400 --> 18:44.880
Maybe.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.880
Or maybe it's
the ghost of a Templar Knight

18:48.040 --> 18:50.560
who wants to be left in peace.

19:11.440 --> 19:14.000
What's going on?

19:14.160 --> 19:17.040
They're saying the body
is someone called Ornella.

19:29.600 --> 19:34.200
It was 25, maybe 30 years ago.

19:34.360 --> 19:38.480
Ornella Pannacci
was 16 years old.

19:43.040 --> 19:47.520
One night in July,
her father and brothers

19:47.680 --> 19:51.760
went out hunting in the hills...

19:53.080 --> 19:54.920
and she vanished.

19:56.920 --> 20:00.320
The father ran
a demolition business.

20:00.480 --> 20:02.800
They all lived there.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.720
Signor Pannacci and his sons

20:04.880 --> 20:08.440
got back at dawn,
and she was gone.

20:08.600 --> 20:11.960
No bags, no clothes taken.

20:12.120 --> 20:16.040
All her possessions
were still there.

20:16.200 --> 20:19.920
The whole village turned out
to look for her.

20:20.080 --> 20:21.920
Of course, we did.

20:22.080 --> 20:25.720
People came from all around.

20:25.880 --> 20:30.400
They even brought police
from Perugia with dogs.

20:30.560 --> 20:34.720
They took them to the house
of the main suspect,

20:34.880 --> 20:39.200
a man named Sabatini,
and the dogs went wild.

20:39.360 --> 20:42.680
But they didn't find anything.

20:44.960 --> 20:48.960
Everyone was convinced that
Sabatini was her killer.

20:57.640 --> 20:58.800
Ah!

21:11.000 --> 21:12.920
-Hey.
-Ah. Ciao, Bernardo.

21:13.080 --> 21:14.480
Ciao.

21:17.120 --> 21:18.760
-Thanks.
-Oh, grazie.

21:18.920 --> 21:20.880
-Here. Here. Per te.
-Grazie.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.320
-What's the news?
-Mm.

21:23.480 --> 21:25.360
Somebody attacked
Carlo Sabatini's

21:25.520 --> 21:27.240
house last night.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.160
The guy who killed Ornella.

21:29.320 --> 21:31.320
-Was he hurt?
-Must have been.

21:31.480 --> 21:33.600
Dottore Matteo
was there first thing.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.680
Oh.

21:43.360 --> 21:44.840
It was a young woman
out for a run

21:45.000 --> 21:47.400
who heard the dog howling
and went to check.

21:47.560 --> 21:49.120
Sabatini was semi-conscious.

21:50.720 --> 21:52.400
How is he?

21:52.560 --> 21:54.240
I wanted him to go to the
hospital for some tests,

21:54.400 --> 21:55.720
but he refused.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.720
He's tough. Very tough.

21:57.880 --> 21:59.880
He'll survive.

22:00.040 --> 22:02.800
Were you living in Panicale
when Ornella disappeared?

22:04.080 --> 22:05.640
I had just come back.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.640
Do you think Sabatini
killed her?

22:09.800 --> 22:12.720
I don't know, my dear,
I really don't know.

22:12.880 --> 22:15.720
But I can see
why people think he did.

22:15.880 --> 22:17.920
He was Ornella's
brothers' friend.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.400
And a couple of people saw him

22:19.560 --> 22:21.080
near the Pannaccis'
demolition yard

22:21.240 --> 22:23.160
the night she disappeared.

22:24.240 --> 22:25.720
-What's he like?
-Sylv.

22:25.880 --> 22:27.200
Just curious.

22:28.400 --> 22:29.840
Thank you.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.040
Here, let me get that.

22:39.200 --> 22:40.920
Now do me a favour.

22:41.080 --> 22:43.520
I told Sabatini
to come to the surgery

22:43.680 --> 22:47.320
to pick up some antibiotics,
but I'm sure he won't.

22:47.480 --> 22:49.840
You could take them out to him.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.040
You might even
persuade him to take them.

23:03.920 --> 23:06.120
SignorSabatini?

23:06.280 --> 23:08.160
Ah.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.960
My name's Sylvia.

23:11.080 --> 23:12.320
Dottore Vitale asked me

23:12.480 --> 23:15.200
to stop by and give you this.

23:15.360 --> 23:17.200
Antibiotics...

23:17.360 --> 23:19.800
to stop your wound
from getting infected.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.000
Signor?

23:26.960 --> 23:28.800
Your garden's very lovely.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.360
I've just moved to Panicale.

23:31.520 --> 23:32.960
I'm looking for a gardener.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.360
I don't work for other people.

23:35.520 --> 23:38.080
But you worked up at the castle,
didn't you?

23:41.600 --> 23:43.720
You're not looking
for a gardener.

23:43.880 --> 23:47.560
You came here
to look at the monster.

23:47.720 --> 23:51.680
Now you've seen him,
you can go away.

23:54.680 --> 23:56.920
Everyone's saying that
it's Ornella Pannacci

23:57.080 --> 23:58.440
that's buried up at the castle.

23:59.720 --> 24:01.520
Do you think they're right?

24:06.800 --> 24:08.320
No.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.160
I've just bought
a house in Panicale.

25:26.320 --> 25:29.560
I, I'm looking to demolish
some of the outbuildings

25:29.720 --> 25:32.800
and I wondered if your company
would be able to help?

25:32.960 --> 25:34.520
We are closed.

25:38.040 --> 25:39.920
I am Giuseppe.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.760
I am sorry about my brother,

25:41.920 --> 25:44.360
but we recently
had some bad news.

25:44.520 --> 25:46.520
Oh, God.
The name.

25:48.320 --> 25:50.400
Are you related
to Ornella Pannacci?

25:52.640 --> 25:54.280
She was our sister.

25:54.440 --> 25:55.760
I'm so sorry.

25:55.920 --> 25:58.040
They better get
the bastard this time.

25:58.200 --> 25:59.400
Which bastard?

26:00.840 --> 26:03.040
Carlo Sabatini.

26:03.200 --> 26:04.480
You must be new here.

26:04.640 --> 26:07.400
Everyone knows about
Carlo Sabatini.

26:07.560 --> 26:10.040
You think this Sabatini
killed your sister?

26:10.200 --> 26:12.000
Of course he did.

26:12.160 --> 26:14.960
He used to hang around here
when we were younger.

26:25.320 --> 26:26.920
He was not right in the head...

26:27.080 --> 26:28.640
Sabatini.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.440
Hardly talked.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.920
Stood around like a big dummy.

26:35.040 --> 26:37.440
But we felt sorry for him,
me and Andrea.

26:37.600 --> 26:39.040
We'd all been in school
together, you know,

26:39.200 --> 26:43.240
so we let him come over,
drink beer, watch football.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.640
But my father never liked it.

26:45.800 --> 26:48.160
He wouldn't let Ornella
anywhere near Sabatini.

26:48.320 --> 26:49.200
Why not?

26:49.360 --> 26:51.040
The way he used to look at her.

26:51.200 --> 26:53.920
Like he wanted
something from her.

26:54.080 --> 26:57.040
After she disappeared, Papa
never got over losing Ornella.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.960
I think that's what
killed him in the end.

27:01.360 --> 27:04.120
We lost him five years ago.

27:04.280 --> 27:06.880
I hope you can
find some peace now,

27:07.040 --> 27:08.840
one way or another.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.280
Thank you, Signora.

27:10.440 --> 27:12.800
We appreciate that.

27:12.960 --> 27:14.880
I'm sorry we cannot help you.

28:01.960 --> 28:03.200
Signora!

28:05.240 --> 28:08.120
We are going to clear out
the big fireplace now.

28:08.280 --> 28:11.720
Are you telling me that I should
go out for the rest of the day?

28:11.880 --> 28:16.880
Er, it's going to get a little
dusty and a little loud.

28:27.760 --> 28:29.000
Mamma Mia!

28:33.520 --> 28:36.240
-Hello.
-Er, ciao.Valentino Infante.

28:36.400 --> 28:38.480
-And you are?
-Sylvia Fox.

28:40.680 --> 28:43.320
Yes, I was with Mallory Bell
when the body was found.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.240
Are you the Marchese?

28:47.400 --> 28:48.720
Oh, no, no.
No, thank God.

28:48.880 --> 28:50.440
That died with my grandfather.

28:50.600 --> 28:54.280
My mother was his only child,
so the castle came to me.

28:54.440 --> 28:56.360
You would have had the title.

28:56.520 --> 28:59.120
If only your mother
had been a boy.

28:59.280 --> 29:02.400
This is an intriguing
collection.

29:02.560 --> 29:05.760
Protest art,
I think you'd call it.

29:05.920 --> 29:07.720
Dates back to 1945.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.840
My grandfather
put up these signs,

29:11.000 --> 29:11.920
as part of a campaign

29:12.080 --> 29:13.200
to try and get the Germans

29:13.360 --> 29:15.200
to return everything
after the war.

29:15.360 --> 29:16.600
Did he have any luck?

29:16.760 --> 29:18.480
A few items found
their way back.

29:31.520 --> 29:32.880
Poor Elena.

29:33.040 --> 29:35.240
She still feels the shame.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.480
She makes it her duty
to remind me

29:38.640 --> 29:41.560
of how precious this castle
is to the village.

29:43.360 --> 29:45.400
But I can't afford
to keep it on.

29:54.960 --> 29:58.640
Not what you were expecting
when you came to Monterosa.

29:58.800 --> 29:59.920
What are you doing here?

30:00.080 --> 30:01.400
Checking you're okay.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.920
Thanks.I'm not.

30:05.240 --> 30:07.720
Why don't you go away
for a few days?

30:07.880 --> 30:09.280
To Rome, or Florence?

30:09.440 --> 30:11.920
I'll let you know
when you can start work again.

30:12.080 --> 30:14.080
Are you trying to get rid of me?

30:14.240 --> 30:17.480
Of course not.
I'm worried about you.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.720
Well, it's a bit late
for that now, isn't it?

30:20.760 --> 30:23.120
At least let me buy you a drink.

30:32.440 --> 30:34.160
-Oh.
-To your tenure.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.880
Professor until they
cart you out in a box?

30:38.040 --> 30:40.800
Oh, please don't mock me,
Sylvia Fox.

30:40.960 --> 30:42.600
I wasn't.

30:46.560 --> 30:47.840
I'm not getting my professorship

30:48.000 --> 30:49.720
at the end of the month.

30:52.080 --> 30:56.840
The University doesn't
even know... that I'm here.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.480
I didn't credit a colleague
in a paper that I published,

30:59.640 --> 31:01.440
and it's all blown up.

31:01.600 --> 31:06.440
And now I am on unpaid leave
until they decide my position.

31:06.600 --> 31:08.320
Oh, Mallory.
I'm sorry.

31:08.480 --> 31:10.640
Please don't Mallory me. I...

31:12.600 --> 31:15.200
I just wanted to find
another Templar site.

31:15.360 --> 31:17.080
The oldest one in Italy.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.840
Did you know that today
is the Queen of England's

32:04.000 --> 32:05.840
official birthday?

32:06.000 --> 32:09.200
Yes, our Queen is so important
that she has two birthdays.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.200
So, how about you all
join me in celebrating

32:11.360 --> 32:13.400
and I buy everyone a drink?

32:13.560 --> 32:16.000
Thanks, Signora,
but I'm leaving.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.640
Fuck your Queen.

32:23.520 --> 32:25.400
Drinks all round, then.

33:05.120 --> 33:08.800
Hamdani says thank you
for saving him from himself.

33:08.960 --> 33:10.440
Does he?

33:12.680 --> 33:15.120
Oh, he will,
when he's calmed down.

33:15.280 --> 33:16.800
He did well to keep his cool.

33:18.760 --> 33:21.760
You know, Bevilacqua comes
from a long line of little men.

33:21.920 --> 33:24.400
His grandfather, Antonio,
was a partisan in the war

33:24.560 --> 33:26.520
and called himself
a "Hero of Panicale"

33:26.680 --> 33:29.160
for shooting up...
a couple of Germans.

33:30.880 --> 33:33.360
And Bevilacqua thinks
he can act like the king.

33:33.520 --> 33:36.080
What a weasel.

33:40.480 --> 33:42.400
Can I walk with you?

33:44.080 --> 33:47.200
Giuseppe Pannacci was with
Bevilacqua at the bar,

33:47.360 --> 33:49.520
and outside
the Town Hall earlier.

33:49.680 --> 33:51.600
Well, it's a small village.

33:51.760 --> 33:53.840
Everybody knows everybody.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.440
-I've met the Pannacci brothers.
-Mm-hmm.

33:56.600 --> 33:59.080
There's something
not right there.

33:59.240 --> 34:01.240
Ah, their sister was murdered.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.960
Of course something's not right.

34:05.120 --> 34:07.040
It's more than that.

34:08.840 --> 34:11.520
They're hiding something.

34:11.680 --> 34:13.440
I think Andrea might
have something to say,

34:13.600 --> 34:15.760
if only his brother
will let him.

34:18.640 --> 34:21.800
Er, why are you so interested
in Ornella Pannacci?

34:21.960 --> 34:25.000
She disappeared 25 years
before you came to Panicale.

34:25.160 --> 34:27.480
I found her body.

34:27.640 --> 34:30.560
Yeah, but it's not your job
to find her killer.

34:33.680 --> 34:35.400
I need to know.

34:40.200 --> 34:41.880
Well, I'm this way.

34:42.040 --> 34:44.000
The house is still a wreck.

35:06.960 --> 35:09.560
God knows how much the building
works are gonna cost in the end.

35:09.720 --> 35:11.720
Yeah, so any news
on your flat yet?

35:11.880 --> 35:13.760
Ah, yes. I got
an offer yesterday.

35:13.920 --> 35:15.400
I forgot to tell you
in all the excitement.

35:15.560 --> 35:16.680
Brilliant.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.480
Mm.

35:21.640 --> 35:23.320
-Delicious lemonade.
-Mm.

35:23.480 --> 35:25.200
Just what I needed.

35:25.360 --> 35:27.440
Do you remember that
holiday in Wales?

35:27.600 --> 35:30.000
One with the enormous beach
and the sea mist?

35:30.160 --> 35:31.920
Yes.

35:32.080 --> 35:33.480
With the cafe that sold the best

35:33.640 --> 35:35.120
lemon ice lollies
that Mum loved.

35:35.280 --> 35:36.600
Yeah.

35:36.760 --> 35:38.560
That's where Dad
taught me to swim.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.040
No, no.

35:41.160 --> 35:43.520
No, that was years after.

35:43.680 --> 35:45.080
In fact, I don't,
I don't think he ever

35:45.240 --> 35:46.880
came on holiday with us,
even before.

35:47.040 --> 35:48.360
Yes, he did.

35:48.520 --> 35:50.400
I remember jumping through
the waves with him,

35:50.560 --> 35:52.800
and him holding on to me,
and telling me to kick.

35:54.600 --> 35:57.280
That must have been Uncle David.

35:57.440 --> 35:59.560
I mean, we sometimes
went on holiday

35:59.720 --> 36:02.040
with him and our cousins.

36:02.200 --> 36:03.880
Definitely wasn't Dad.

36:31.040 --> 36:32.640
Good afternoon, Sylvia.

36:32.800 --> 36:34.520
I'm glad I've caught you.

36:34.680 --> 36:37.400
We must start to do
cookery lessons.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.160
Soon, I promise.

36:39.320 --> 36:42.040
I know you've been busy
at the castle.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.840
Ah, yes. Actually, I wanted
to ask you something.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.840
When I was there,
I noticed Elena Decone

36:48.000 --> 36:50.960
looking at a photo
of one of the missing artworks.

36:51.120 --> 36:52.920
You mean La Marchesa.

36:53.080 --> 36:55.840
That painting was 500 years old.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.720
The pride of the village.

36:57.880 --> 37:03.520
Rumours has it, it was Elena's
older sister who took it.

37:03.680 --> 37:06.040
It was her ticket to Germany.

37:06.200 --> 37:08.400
It broke Elena's heart.

37:12.920 --> 37:15.280
Oh, don't worry,
these cakes aren't for me.

37:15.440 --> 37:16.640
They're for my builders.

37:16.800 --> 37:18.000
-Ah.
-To keep them sweet.

37:18.160 --> 37:19.920
Okay.

37:20.080 --> 37:23.320
-Grazie. Ciao.
-Ciao.See you later. Ciao.

41:15.960 --> 41:19.640
Has there been some new evidence
found against SignorSabatini?

41:19.800 --> 41:21.920
A pot of red paint in his shed.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.400
Same pigmentation

41:23.560 --> 41:26.080
as the graffiti
you found at the castle.

41:26.240 --> 41:27.880
You exposed him to all this

41:28.040 --> 41:30.480
because he owns
a tin of red paint?

41:30.640 --> 41:33.200
There were other factors,

41:33.360 --> 41:35.400
which I'm not at liberty
to disclose.

41:39.920 --> 41:41.720
Who's she?

41:41.880 --> 41:44.280
-Your nurse?
-No, no.

41:44.440 --> 41:47.120
She's just a good Samaritan.

41:47.280 --> 41:48.840
But I warn you...

41:49.800 --> 41:51.840
resistance is futile.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.280
Ah.

41:55.040 --> 41:56.480
Is there someone
who'll feed your dog,

41:56.640 --> 41:58.400
if you have to be away?

42:00.000 --> 42:02.640
The farmer next door.

42:02.800 --> 42:04.040
Good.

42:06.080 --> 42:08.320
When Ornella disappeared

42:08.480 --> 42:11.080
and everyone was
saying you killed her,

42:11.240 --> 42:13.200
why did you stay in Panicale?

42:13.360 --> 42:15.120
Why didn't you just leave?

42:15.280 --> 42:17.720
I was born here.

42:17.880 --> 42:19.520
Where would I go?

42:21.280 --> 42:22.840
You were very sure
that it wasn't

42:23.000 --> 42:24.960
Ornella at the castle.

42:25.120 --> 42:27.360
Is that because
you know where she is?

42:27.520 --> 42:29.240
Carlo Sabatini...

42:35.960 --> 42:37.760
You're arresting him?

42:37.920 --> 42:39.800
I thought you were just bringing
him in for questioning?

42:39.960 --> 42:41.360
What's changed?

42:41.520 --> 42:44.880
Oh, Sabatini has owned
a truck for nearly 30 years,

42:45.040 --> 42:48.040
and at some point, interior
was cleaned with bleach.

42:48.200 --> 42:51.440
But luminol testing
showed up blood stains

42:51.600 --> 42:54.480
on the back seat
and on the passenger door.

42:55.800 --> 42:58.560
The DNA is a match
for Ornella Pannacci.

43:20.840 --> 43:22.760
You knew her, didn't you?

43:34.640 --> 43:38.360
Listen, I was born here,
I went to school here.

43:38.520 --> 43:39.840
When I came back from
the medical school,

43:40.000 --> 43:41.360
I got my first job here.

43:41.520 --> 43:44.200
Twenty-five years ago
last month.

43:44.360 --> 43:46.000
Was Ornella
one of your patients?

43:46.160 --> 43:47.960
Si. Si.

43:49.600 --> 43:51.760
For a few weeks
before she went missing,

43:51.920 --> 43:55.280
she was complaining
of bad headaches.

43:55.440 --> 43:58.360
I thought something
was going on, at home.

43:58.520 --> 44:01.480
She had a couple of bruises,
falls, she said.

44:01.640 --> 44:02.920
They lived
in a demolition yard

44:03.080 --> 44:06.480
so it seemed plausible.

44:06.640 --> 44:10.000
She was very anxious,
withdrawn.

44:10.160 --> 44:12.920
Her father accompanied her
to every appointment.

44:15.520 --> 44:17.400
I was young, green.

44:18.640 --> 44:20.160
I didn't say anything to anyone.

44:21.440 --> 44:22.920
I didn't know what to do.

44:23.080 --> 44:25.520
And I didn't do anything.

44:25.680 --> 44:27.160
And then, it was too late.

44:36.560 --> 44:38.840
-Good morning.
-Buongiorno.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.400
I'm off to Rome.

44:40.560 --> 44:42.280
-You'll lock up when you leave?
-Of course.

44:42.440 --> 44:44.960
-A new car?
-Yes.

44:45.120 --> 44:47.600
I thought it was time
I had one of my own.

44:47.760 --> 44:49.560
-Very nice.
-Thanks.

44:49.720 --> 44:52.040
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

45:12.720 --> 45:14.280
I was surprised
when you called.

45:14.440 --> 45:16.440
And that you're still here.

45:16.600 --> 45:18.760
I'm a bit surprised,
too.

45:26.240 --> 45:29.200
I have the police report
you asked for.

45:29.360 --> 45:33.200
Giuseppe Pannacci has a couple
of convictions for affray

45:33.360 --> 45:36.160
and Andrea
has one for criminal damage.

45:37.120 --> 45:38.800
Their father, Alfredo,

45:38.960 --> 45:42.120
had some convictions
for minor offences,

45:42.280 --> 45:45.080
but what is interesting
is the number of accusations

45:45.240 --> 45:47.680
against him that
didn't get to court.

45:47.840 --> 45:49.040
Such as?

45:49.200 --> 45:51.880
Well, he was investigated twice

45:52.040 --> 45:53.960
for assaulting his wife,

45:54.120 --> 45:55.280
but the charges were dropped

45:55.440 --> 45:58.560
when she refused to testify.

45:58.720 --> 46:00.440
She died when
the children were quite young.

46:01.120 --> 46:02.320
Cancer.

46:02.480 --> 46:04.120
How did Alfredo die?

46:04.280 --> 46:06.360
Alcohol-related illness.

46:09.320 --> 46:10.760
One more thing.

46:10.920 --> 46:13.720
Someone called the local
children's charity

46:13.880 --> 46:15.520
in Umbria three times

46:15.680 --> 46:17.320
before Ornella disappeared.

46:17.480 --> 46:20.400
The calls only lasted, pfft,
three seconds.

46:20.560 --> 46:22.240
The caller just hung up.

46:23.320 --> 46:24.760
Ornella?

46:24.920 --> 46:27.000
Someone in the house.

46:29.760 --> 46:31.480
Any chance you could do
me another favour?

46:50.880 --> 46:52.360
Si.

47:06.560 --> 47:07.960
Ciao, Andrea.

47:10.600 --> 47:12.320
I'm not meant to talk to you.

47:12.480 --> 47:14.000
Why not?

47:14.160 --> 47:15.400
You're not from here.

47:15.560 --> 47:17.880
But that's why
you can talk to me.

47:21.320 --> 47:23.840
Carlo Sabatini was a friend
of yours, wasn't he?

47:25.720 --> 47:27.680
Do you really think
he hurt your sister?

47:29.200 --> 47:31.760
They say he did.

47:31.920 --> 47:35.000
But your father was
a violent man, wasn't he?

47:37.040 --> 47:39.280
Did he beat Ornella?

47:39.440 --> 47:41.560
I-I don't know anything
about that.

47:57.040 --> 47:59.480
No. No, no, no, please, no.

48:16.400 --> 48:18.280
Did your father used
to shut you in here?

48:19.360 --> 48:22.600
When he was angry, or-or drunk.

48:22.760 --> 48:25.000
He did it to Ornella, mostly.

48:25.160 --> 48:26.560
Why was that, do you think?

48:28.400 --> 48:31.120
Because she looked like
our mother.

48:37.240 --> 48:40.160
Do you remember the night
Ornella went missing?

48:40.320 --> 48:41.880
Your father said
he went hunting.

48:42.040 --> 48:44.120
You and him and Giuseppe.

48:44.280 --> 48:46.440
Was your father with you
the whole time?

48:48.640 --> 48:51.280
Andrea, do you think
your father killed your sister?

48:51.440 --> 48:52.680
I don't know.

48:52.840 --> 48:54.960
You called a children's
helpline, didn't you?

49:02.000 --> 49:03.720
You need to disappear.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.320
Like Ornella?

49:08.320 --> 49:10.680
Did your father go too far
and kill Ornella?

49:10.840 --> 49:12.360
Did you help him
bury her at the castle?

49:12.520 --> 49:14.360
Do you ever shut up?

49:19.720 --> 49:21.560
There are four cameras
in this yard.

49:22.960 --> 49:24.880
Two of them are pointing at us.

49:26.520 --> 49:29.040
Cameras malfunction sometimes.

49:29.200 --> 49:31.720
Recordings get erased.

49:31.880 --> 49:35.200
I have a friend who's
very good with technology.

49:35.360 --> 49:37.400
And her software
never malfunctions.

49:56.520 --> 49:59.600
-Sylvia, are you okay?
-Thanks, Raffaella.

49:59.760 --> 50:01.400
I'm out of there.

50:26.640 --> 50:27.960
Hiya.

50:35.640 --> 50:36.960
What's up?

50:39.600 --> 50:41.440
How old was I when dad left?

50:44.840 --> 50:46.320
Oh, well, um...

50:47.800 --> 50:49.400
He didn't exactly leave.

50:50.960 --> 50:53.040
He was away a lot,
and then one day,

50:53.200 --> 50:54.920
he just didn't come back.

50:56.360 --> 50:58.920
You must have been
about two, I think.

51:00.160 --> 51:01.480
Are you sure?

51:03.080 --> 51:05.520
I thought I was older.
Five or six, maybe.

51:08.120 --> 51:09.760
How can I possibly remember him

51:09.920 --> 51:11.840
if I was so young?

51:12.000 --> 51:14.200
Because I do, really clearly.

51:15.960 --> 51:18.000
Your favourite game

51:18.160 --> 51:20.480
was where you were Sylvia

51:20.640 --> 51:22.680
and I had to be dad,

51:22.840 --> 51:26.160
and you would tell me
what to say and do.

51:26.320 --> 51:29.200
And then, when I got bored,

51:29.360 --> 51:31.000
you'd go off
and play on your own.

51:32.400 --> 51:35.360
In your version,
he was the best dad ever.

51:37.280 --> 51:38.760
And in yours?

52:27.600 --> 52:28.600
Hello?

52:28.760 --> 52:30.240
So, I have more information

52:30.400 --> 52:32.480
about those paintings
you asked about.

52:32.640 --> 52:34.120
Okay.

52:34.280 --> 52:36.800
Well, all of them
were eventually traced

52:36.960 --> 52:38.720
to Germany, except one.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.280
La Marchesa?

52:41.440 --> 52:42.800
That's it.

52:44.280 --> 52:45.760
Thanks, Raffaella.

53:02.200 --> 53:05.240
Hey! Hey!

53:05.400 --> 53:07.520
I'm allowed to park there.

53:07.680 --> 53:09.200
If you look
at the penalty notice,

53:09.360 --> 53:10.880
you will see that it does not

53:11.040 --> 53:13.000
relate to a parking violation.

53:13.160 --> 53:14.200
What?

53:14.360 --> 53:16.600
You are a non-EU resident

53:16.760 --> 53:19.880
driving an
EU registered vehicle.

53:20.040 --> 53:23.000
You require separate insurance

53:23.160 --> 53:24.480
that you do not possess.

53:24.640 --> 53:26.760
But I live here.

53:26.920 --> 53:28.400
The penalty is 50 euros

53:28.560 --> 53:30.840
if you pay within 14 days.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.560
One hundred any time
after that.

53:36.680 --> 53:38.560
Good day, Signora.

54:50.080 --> 54:51.840
Hi, Matteo.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.920
You'll never
believe this.

54:58.680 --> 55:00.520
Capitano.

55:03.480 --> 55:05.080
I've just been told.

55:05.240 --> 55:07.200
The body's not Ornella's.

55:07.360 --> 55:08.800
Exacto.

55:08.960 --> 55:10.920
But how do you know?

55:11.080 --> 55:13.680
Because of nuclear tests
in the 1950s.

55:16.960 --> 55:19.280
Well, they released

55:19.440 --> 55:22.440
so much Carbon 14
into the atmosphere,

55:22.600 --> 55:24.120
that the first thing
you can tell

55:24.280 --> 55:26.600
when you analyse
a set of bones

55:26.760 --> 55:29.480
is whether
they are pre or post-1950.

55:30.680 --> 55:32.960
These are pre.

55:33.120 --> 55:34.720
So they can't be Ornella's.

55:36.400 --> 55:39.440
-And Sabatini is in the clear.
-Well, not quite.

55:39.600 --> 55:41.200
Though without a body,
we don't have

55:41.360 --> 55:43.440
enough evidence to charge him.

55:43.600 --> 55:45.760
But if it isn't Ornella
buried at the castle,

55:45.920 --> 55:48.080
then where is she?

55:48.240 --> 55:50.600
It means she's still
a missing person.

55:50.760 --> 55:52.920
Of course.

55:53.080 --> 55:55.400
So maybe she can
be found this time?

55:56.520 --> 55:57.840
Maybe.

56:05.760 --> 56:07.200
You have to bruise the leaves,

56:07.360 --> 56:09.640
or the flavour
doesn't come out.

56:10.960 --> 56:13.680
No, not like that!

56:13.840 --> 56:16.520
Don't slice, shave.

56:16.680 --> 56:19.800
Okay. But wouldn't it be easier
just to press the garlic?

56:19.960 --> 56:21.920
Easier, but wrong.

56:22.080 --> 56:25.080
Imagine it's the vigile's

56:25.240 --> 56:26.600
fat head.

56:26.760 --> 56:30.080
Nothing escapes you, Antonella.

56:30.240 --> 56:32.440
Don't worry about Bevilacqua.

56:32.600 --> 56:35.320
All the men
in that family are assholes.

56:35.480 --> 56:37.720
I thought the grandfather
was a war hero?

56:37.880 --> 56:39.280
Maybe.

56:40.360 --> 56:41.280
White wine?

56:41.440 --> 56:42.680
I thought red with lamb?

56:42.840 --> 56:43.960
To drink, yes.

56:44.120 --> 56:46.080
But when you cook
with tomatoes,

56:46.240 --> 56:48.920
always white.

56:49.080 --> 56:52.200
You heard that the body at the
castle isn't Ornella Pannacci?

56:52.360 --> 56:54.200
It's all everyone's
talking about.

56:54.360 --> 56:56.440
I was glad, but then I thought

56:56.600 --> 56:58.520
about what it means.

56:58.680 --> 56:59.920
That she's still out there.

57:01.200 --> 57:03.000
Buried somewhere else.

57:03.160 --> 57:05.760
Maybe a long way from home.

57:05.920 --> 57:07.280
Please.

57:09.400 --> 57:10.760
Did you know Ornella?

57:10.920 --> 57:11.880
No.

57:12.040 --> 57:13.360
But my neighbour's daughter

57:13.520 --> 57:15.520
Gabriella was friends

57:15.680 --> 57:17.520
with the povera ragazza.

57:17.680 --> 57:20.360
She must have been devastated
when Ornella disappeared.

57:20.520 --> 57:22.200
Of course.

57:24.120 --> 57:26.120
Does Gabriella
still live around here?

57:27.720 --> 57:29.040
In Perugia.

57:34.280 --> 57:35.960
-Salve.
-Hello.

57:37.200 --> 57:40.360
-Can I help you?
-Ah, yes, I hope so.

57:40.520 --> 57:41.600
I've just moved here,

57:41.760 --> 57:44.000
and my garden
is completely wild.

57:44.160 --> 57:45.800
How exciting.

57:45.960 --> 57:47.680
You can make it
into anything you want.

57:49.000 --> 57:50.320
Maybe you know the place.

57:50.480 --> 57:54.000
La Casa Vecchia,
it's just outside Panicale?

57:55.760 --> 57:58.160
You are Gabriella, though,
aren't you?

57:58.320 --> 58:00.320
Didn't you used
to live in Panicale?

58:00.480 --> 58:02.040
How do you know that?

58:02.200 --> 58:04.880
You were recommended to me
by Antonella Vitale.

58:05.040 --> 58:07.760
She said you know everything
there is to know about gardens.

58:08.800 --> 58:10.680
My sister is married to her son.

58:10.840 --> 58:12.200
Matteo?

58:12.360 --> 58:15.520
-Lucky woman.
-I know.

58:15.680 --> 58:17.840
You were friends with
Ornella Pannacci, weren't you?

58:19.960 --> 58:21.680
Do you believe that she's dead?

58:21.840 --> 58:24.000
Why are you asking these
questions?

58:25.560 --> 58:28.160
Matteo's been
so upset about it.

58:28.320 --> 58:30.000
It's brought back
a lot of memories.

58:35.040 --> 58:36.680
For years

58:36.840 --> 58:38.840
after Ornella disappeared,

58:39.000 --> 58:41.160
I kept seeing her.

58:41.320 --> 58:43.200
In the street,
at the supermarket.

58:44.600 --> 58:47.120
But it was always
somebody else.

58:48.440 --> 58:50.280
Was there a reason
you kept hoping?

59:14.800 --> 59:17.920
I gave it to Ornella
for her birthday,

59:18.080 --> 59:20.360
the last one before...

59:20.520 --> 59:22.920
I used to call her
piccolo girasole.

59:23.080 --> 59:24.920
Little sunflower.

59:26.600 --> 59:28.400
Because she'd
light up the room.

59:37.040 --> 59:39.040
She found it
in her bicycle basket.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.200
Did you put it there?

59:50.880 --> 59:53.520
The police haven't given up
on finding her, you know.

59:53.680 --> 59:56.320
It's gonna hit
the news any day now.

59:56.480 --> 59:58.720
Ornella's picture
will be everywhere.

1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:04.720
They will find her.

1:00:08.520 --> 1:00:10.000
I'd forgotten.

1:00:10.880 --> 1:00:12.720
What?

1:00:12.880 --> 1:00:14.560
I'll show you.

1:00:14.720 --> 1:00:16.080
No one else.

1:00:16.920 --> 1:00:18.400
Just you.

1:00:21.360 --> 1:00:22.800
You drive.

1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:28.520
Okay.

1:00:28.680 --> 1:00:29.800
Come on.

1:00:47.200 --> 1:00:48.680
Where am I going?

1:00:48.840 --> 1:00:50.360
Left at the end.

1:00:51.240 --> 1:00:52.920
Away from Panicale?

1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:17.760
Where are we going, Carlo?

1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:23.280
You found Ornella in the
demolition yard, didn't you?

1:01:25.960 --> 1:01:28.000
Her father had locked
her in the outbuilding.

1:01:32.200 --> 1:01:33.720
She was bleeding.

1:01:35.520 --> 1:01:38.040
Did you do something to her,
to make her get in your truck?

1:01:41.200 --> 1:01:43.360
Her blood was in your truck.

1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:01.240
Where now?

1:02:01.400 --> 1:02:03.480
Where did you take
Ornella that night?

1:02:03.640 --> 1:02:06.160
I can't tell you.
I can't tell you.

1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:08.920
-Why not?
-I made a promise!

1:02:11.560 --> 1:02:12.600
Carlo.

1:02:49.400 --> 1:02:52.040
Ah, meravigliosa!

1:02:54.800 --> 1:02:57.560
-Grazie.
-Prego.

1:02:57.720 --> 1:02:59.840
Have you delivered any
letters to SignorSabatini

1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:01.120
since he's been released?

1:03:01.280 --> 1:03:04.040
Oh, I never deliver
to Sabatini.

1:03:04.920 --> 1:03:06.000
Then who does?

1:03:06.160 --> 1:03:07.720
Nobody.

1:03:07.880 --> 1:03:09.760
After his first, uh, arrest,

1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:12.040
people sent him all stuff,

1:03:12.200 --> 1:03:15.480
uh, like knives,
uh, nails, dogshit.

1:03:15.640 --> 1:03:18.240
All the postmen
refused to deliver.

1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:20.560
Well, then what's
happened to his mail?

1:03:20.720 --> 1:03:23.680
Hmm. It's kept
at the post office.

1:03:23.840 --> 1:03:26.080
For him to come and pick up,
if he wants.

1:03:26.240 --> 1:03:28.680
But he never does.

1:03:46.600 --> 1:03:49.040
Be quick.
I'm not really supposed to...

1:05:12.520 --> 1:05:14.560
-Signora?
-Salve.

1:05:14.720 --> 1:05:17.000
I'd like to look at some old
marriage registers, please.

1:05:17.160 --> 1:05:19.560
-For when?
-About 50 years ago, roughly.

1:05:19.720 --> 1:05:21.240
-Certo.
-Grazie.

1:06:18.560 --> 1:06:21.760
Tell me one good thing
that happened this week.

1:06:24.680 --> 1:06:27.080
I got angry
with that girl again...

1:06:28.480 --> 1:06:29.960
but I didn't hit her.

1:06:30.120 --> 1:06:31.880
I didn't even shout.

1:06:32.040 --> 1:06:33.520
Well done.

1:06:41.040 --> 1:06:42.560
See you next week, Pablo.

1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:44.960
Bye.

1:06:45.120 --> 1:06:47.360
-Arrivederci.
-Grazie.

1:07:11.400 --> 1:07:12.800
SignorSabatini.

1:07:14.400 --> 1:07:16.800
I've brought
someone to see you.

1:07:16.960 --> 1:07:18.880
I hope you don't mind.

1:07:24.120 --> 1:07:26.120
Carlo.

1:07:36.520 --> 1:07:37.960
Ornella?

1:07:50.880 --> 1:07:52.920
I had no idea.

1:07:57.920 --> 1:07:59.800
And I can't believe
you kept my secret

1:07:59.960 --> 1:08:03.640
for so long,
after all you've suffered.

1:08:03.800 --> 1:08:07.040
It was worth it, to get you away
from your father.

1:08:08.120 --> 1:08:10.480
I just wanted you to be safe.

1:08:11.800 --> 1:08:13.440
I tried to let you know.

1:08:16.320 --> 1:08:17.880
It doesn't matter now.

1:08:19.640 --> 1:08:21.080
You're okay?

1:08:22.480 --> 1:08:24.600
You have a good life?

1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:30.080
Of course I struggled

1:08:30.240 --> 1:08:32.160
for a long time, but...

1:08:33.760 --> 1:08:35.960
I got help.

1:08:36.120 --> 1:08:37.880
And now I give it.

1:08:40.080 --> 1:08:41.880
I have a good life, Carlo.

1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:44.080
Thanks to you.

1:09:15.880 --> 1:09:17.880
I remember the sound
of the bolt

1:09:18.040 --> 1:09:19.560
being pulled back.

1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:23.440
At first I thought
it was my father,

1:09:23.600 --> 1:09:25.840
come back to hit me again.

1:09:27.920 --> 1:09:30.240
But then I realised
it was Carlo.

1:09:33.440 --> 1:09:35.280
I barely knew him.

1:09:35.440 --> 1:09:38.400
I'd said maybe
three words to him.

1:09:40.560 --> 1:09:43.280
And he picked me up
and took me out of there.

1:09:45.640 --> 1:09:48.760
I laid under a blanket
until we were out of town.

1:09:51.920 --> 1:09:54.360
Then we stopped
at Gabriella's farm...

1:09:55.880 --> 1:09:58.520
and I asked him to leave
my scarf for her,

1:09:58.680 --> 1:10:00.920
to show her I was okay.

1:10:04.840 --> 1:10:06.720
We drove for hours.

1:10:06.880 --> 1:10:10.120
I drifted in and out
of consciousness.

1:10:10.280 --> 1:10:14.000
But every time
I opened my eyes, he was there.

1:10:16.080 --> 1:10:17.480
Did you have a plan?

1:10:19.400 --> 1:10:22.240
I'd been to Bologna

1:10:22.400 --> 1:10:24.120
once with mama.

1:10:24.960 --> 1:10:26.600
Big city.

1:10:28.080 --> 1:10:30.120
Didn't want anyone to know.

1:10:31.440 --> 1:10:33.320
I made Carlo promise.

1:10:34.840 --> 1:10:38.320
And I changed my name,

1:10:38.480 --> 1:10:39.880
enrolled in school.

1:10:41.040 --> 1:10:42.600
And never look back.

1:10:44.120 --> 1:10:45.560
You were very brave.

1:10:52.400 --> 1:10:55.240
Um, Sylvia...

1:10:55.400 --> 1:10:57.880
what made you think
I was still alive?

1:11:00.480 --> 1:11:02.720
I couldn't quite
believe it of Carlo.

1:11:04.280 --> 1:11:07.720
And then the scarf
and the postcard.

1:11:07.880 --> 1:11:10.120
It was lucky you took
your mother's maiden name,

1:11:10.280 --> 1:11:12.160
or I would never
have found you.

1:11:13.480 --> 1:11:15.600
And lucky that my father
and brothers

1:11:15.760 --> 1:11:17.640
weren't as clever as you.

1:11:21.920 --> 1:11:23.840
Do they know I'm here?

1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:27.120
No. It's up to you
if you want to see them.

1:11:33.200 --> 1:11:35.520
That last day,

1:11:35.680 --> 1:11:37.200
when I told my father to stop

1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:38.920
or I'd go to the police...

1:11:40.960 --> 1:11:43.200
he beat me so badly

1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:45.080
that I thought
I was going to die.

1:11:49.360 --> 1:11:52.400
And Andrea tried to stop him...

1:11:54.320 --> 1:11:56.440
but there was
nothing he could do.

1:11:59.440 --> 1:12:01.560
Giuseppe didn't even try.

1:12:05.400 --> 1:12:08.640
I think your brothers were
terrified of your father too.

1:12:08.800 --> 1:12:10.680
So was Carlo.

1:12:10.840 --> 1:12:13.120
But that didn't stop him
helping me.

1:12:35.840 --> 1:12:37.440
Hello?

1:12:37.600 --> 1:12:39.960
Some forensics news,
SignoraVolpe.

1:12:47.520 --> 1:12:49.440
It seems that she was shot.

1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:52.600
At close range, judging
from the bone splinters.

1:12:53.920 --> 1:12:56.000
But they also found this,

1:12:56.160 --> 1:12:59.240
in the earth packed
into her chest cavity.

1:12:59.400 --> 1:13:01.120
What is it?

1:13:01.280 --> 1:13:03.600
The badge
of La Brigata Garibaldi.

1:13:03.760 --> 1:13:05.200
The partisans.

1:13:06.720 --> 1:13:09.520
Is there any record
of any female partisan

1:13:09.680 --> 1:13:12.160
from the area
who went missing in action?

1:13:12.320 --> 1:13:14.800
Uh, we are checking,
but it's difficult.

1:13:14.960 --> 1:13:16.360
A lot of people
disappeared during

1:13:16.520 --> 1:13:18.680
the last years
of the war, so...

1:13:18.840 --> 1:13:20.600
She may not even
have been from here.

1:13:20.760 --> 1:13:21.880
Poor girl.

1:13:23.320 --> 1:13:25.600
At least she died
with honour.

1:13:28.680 --> 1:13:31.680
The shame of my family.

1:13:35.960 --> 1:13:37.760
I was the only one

1:13:37.920 --> 1:13:40.360
they left behind.

1:13:42.200 --> 1:13:44.080
When I was young,

1:13:44.240 --> 1:13:46.480
my mother was always

1:13:46.640 --> 1:13:48.920
busy caring for the Marchesa.

1:13:50.200 --> 1:13:54.320
Adriana was,
uh, 15 years older.

1:13:54.480 --> 1:13:57.480
-Your sister?
-Yes. Yes.

1:13:57.640 --> 1:14:00.760
She took the place
of a mother for me.

1:14:00.920 --> 1:14:04.080
She was much older,

1:14:04.240 --> 1:14:07.400
but she always
had time to play.

1:14:09.800 --> 1:14:12.720
I was three, four...

1:14:12.880 --> 1:14:15.280
And I hid...

1:14:15.440 --> 1:14:17.320
in these gardens.

1:14:18.080 --> 1:14:20.640
I had all,

1:14:20.800 --> 1:14:23.040
all the best hiding places.

1:14:32.120 --> 1:14:35.960
But Adriana always found me.

1:14:36.120 --> 1:14:39.400
Did you ever have
a special hiding place?

1:14:39.560 --> 1:14:42.080
One that only you and Adriana
knew about?

1:14:46.200 --> 1:14:48.120
Yes.

1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:24.400
What's this?

1:15:29.120 --> 1:15:30.920
Mio Dio, La Marchesa!

1:15:34.240 --> 1:15:37.080
Your sister didn't steal
La Marchesa, Elena.

1:15:37.240 --> 1:15:38.800
She saved her.

1:15:38.960 --> 1:15:42.400
Hid the portrait somewhere
no one would find it.

1:15:42.560 --> 1:15:44.520
But then why did she run away?

1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:49.720
I don't think
she did run away.

1:15:51.040 --> 1:15:53.600
I think she's been
here all along,

1:15:53.760 --> 1:15:55.760
waiting for us to find her.

1:16:22.480 --> 1:16:24.800
Thank you all
for coming today.

1:16:24.960 --> 1:16:27.040
We're celebrating
the return of not just one,

1:16:27.200 --> 1:16:29.880
but two daughters
of Panicale.

1:16:30.040 --> 1:16:32.560
Doctor Ornella Masetti
has returned to us

1:16:32.720 --> 1:16:35.080
after 25 years.

1:16:35.240 --> 1:16:37.720
She's a distinguished
citizen of Bologna now,

1:16:37.880 --> 1:16:40.400
but she'll always
be one of our own.

1:16:40.560 --> 1:16:43.480
And after almost eighty years
in hiding,

1:16:43.640 --> 1:16:46.640
our renaissance treasure,
La Marchesa of Panicale,

1:16:46.800 --> 1:16:49.120
is finally back
where she belongs.

1:16:50.320 --> 1:16:52.520
This is also a homecoming

1:16:52.680 --> 1:16:55.440
for two people who've been
wronged for far too long.

1:16:56.880 --> 1:16:59.840
Carlo Sabatini
was Ornella's saviour.

1:17:03.400 --> 1:17:07.040
And Adriana Decone was accused
of being a traitor.

1:17:07.200 --> 1:17:09.320
Now we know that
she gave her life

1:17:09.480 --> 1:17:11.360
to defend her freedom.

1:17:14.960 --> 1:17:18.480
So it is with great pleasure
that I ask Elena Decone

1:17:18.640 --> 1:17:21.280
to honour her
sister's memory by unveiling

1:17:21.440 --> 1:17:24.080
the pride of Panicale,
La Marchesa.

1:17:51.400 --> 1:17:53.840
And Bevilacqua
has put in for a transfer.

1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:56.680
Thank God. I can't afford
any more parking tickets.

1:17:56.840 --> 1:17:59.680
So you really
think he was responsible

1:17:59.840 --> 1:18:00.960
for the graffiti?

1:18:01.120 --> 1:18:02.200
Why?

1:18:02.360 --> 1:18:04.680
To stop Mallory
finding Adriana.

1:18:04.840 --> 1:18:06.680
How would he know
that she was there?

1:18:06.840 --> 1:18:09.240
I think his
grandfather told him.

1:18:09.400 --> 1:18:11.520
Old man Bevilacqua
was a partisan.

1:18:11.680 --> 1:18:13.600
If he knew that
the Nazis shot Adriana,

1:18:13.760 --> 1:18:15.600
he would have spoken out
after the war.

1:18:15.760 --> 1:18:18.160
Unless he was a traitor,
and he shot Adriana

1:18:18.320 --> 1:18:20.360
because she wouldn't
give up the picture.

1:18:20.520 --> 1:18:22.920
Then changed
his story after the war,

1:18:23.080 --> 1:18:24.800
so that he became the hero.

1:18:27.360 --> 1:18:28.640
Brava.

1:18:32.720 --> 1:18:36.600
So, Valentino's
decided against selling up.

1:18:36.760 --> 1:18:39.760
It's good news
for Panicale, I think.

1:18:39.920 --> 1:18:42.040
All the excitement about
the return of the painting

1:18:42.200 --> 1:18:43.760
seems to have inspired him.

1:18:43.920 --> 1:18:46.280
I must say,
I found that so moving.

1:18:46.440 --> 1:18:48.160
Yeah. And what about
your dig, Mallory?

1:18:48.320 --> 1:18:49.760
Can you get back to work now?

1:18:49.920 --> 1:18:53.480
No point, with term
starting again next week.

1:18:53.640 --> 1:18:55.280
When they heard that
I was part of the recovery

1:18:55.440 --> 1:18:58.920
of the Marchesa,
Marlowe Hill have asked me back.

1:18:59.080 --> 1:19:01.440
The professorship
is still on the cards.

1:19:01.600 --> 1:19:03.400
But Valentino said that

1:19:03.560 --> 1:19:05.880
I can come back
at any time and dig.

1:19:06.040 --> 1:19:08.760
You're welcome to tag along
if you want, Sylvia.

1:19:08.920 --> 1:19:10.120
You too, Arabella.

1:19:10.280 --> 1:19:13.920
Ah, we'll bear that in mind,
won't we, Arabella?

1:19:14.080 --> 1:19:15.680
Excellent.

1:19:33.520 --> 1:19:35.880
Ciao, Tesoro,
ciao, ciao, ciao.

1:20:35.040 --> 1:20:36.360
-Grazie.
-Grazie.

1:20:45.760 --> 1:20:46.960
It's been a lovely evening.

1:20:47.120 --> 1:20:49.280
Thank you.

1:20:49.440 --> 1:20:51.080
My pleasure.

1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:01.480
I should find a taxi.

1:21:03.560 --> 1:21:06.560
Sorry, I cannot invite you back
to my place.

1:21:08.480 --> 1:21:09.960
It's okay.

1:21:13.360 --> 1:21:15.560
I live
in the Carabinieri barracks.

1:21:15.720 --> 1:21:17.840
And Hamdani is also
on the same floor.
