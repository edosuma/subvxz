00:01.697 --> 00:04.134
[DRUMMERS PLAYING,
WHISTLE BLOWING]

00:33.424 --> 00:37.080
WHOO! YOU KNOW
IT JUST NEED TO BE SAID.

00:37.124 --> 00:38.560
BRINGSTON HOMECOMINGS
ARE FIRE.

00:38.603 --> 00:39.952
PERIOD.

00:39.996 --> 00:41.867
IT IS ONLY
THE FIRST DAY,
AND I CAN TELL

00:41.911 --> 00:43.695
I'M ALREADY GONNA
LIKE IT MORE
THAN LAST YEAR.

00:43.739 --> 00:45.741
AH, HELLO. THAT'S
A LIE BECAUSE YOU
MET ME LAST YEAR,

00:45.784 --> 00:48.091
SO THAT'S WHEN THE GAME
WAS CHANGED, HONEY.

00:48.135 --> 00:51.181
BUT SHE AIN'T KNOW ME,
SO THAT MAKES
THIS YEAR THE BEST.

00:51.225 --> 00:53.053
AIN'T THAT RIGHT?

00:53.096 --> 00:55.185
OH, MY GOSH.
SIMONE...

00:55.229 --> 00:56.578
IT'S OUR
FRIENDIVERSARY!

00:56.621 --> 00:58.449
THAT MEANS WE
HAVE TO TOAST,

00:58.493 --> 00:59.972
SO THAT'S Y'ALL'S
CUE. DRINKS, PLEASE.

01:00.016 --> 01:01.365
-WATER FOR ME, THOUGH.
-I GOT YOU.

01:01.409 --> 01:02.758
DO I LOOK LIKE
A WAITER?

01:02.801 --> 01:04.151
YES!

01:04.194 --> 01:05.978
SAY, BROTHER,
TAKE THIS ORDER.

01:06.022 --> 01:10.374
OH, I WISH NATE
WAS HERE INSTEAD OF AT
HER PRE-LAW CONFERENCE.

01:10.418 --> 01:12.420
YOU TWO ARE A BIG REASON
WHY I CAME HERE.

01:12.463 --> 01:14.378
YO, A LOT HAS CHANGED.

01:14.422 --> 01:16.946
SERIOUSLY. I CAME
BEING A WALK-ON,

01:16.989 --> 01:18.556
AND I MADE THE TEAM.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.081
IF I CAN IMPRESS COACH LONI AT
THE PRO TOURNAMENT TOMORROW,

01:21.124 --> 01:22.952
I'LL HAVE A SHOT
AT MAKING TOP 6

01:22.995 --> 01:24.388
AND SINGLES NEXT SEMESTER.

01:24.432 --> 01:27.391
GIRL, YOU GONNA
MAKE TOP 6.

01:27.435 --> 01:31.091
I NEED YOU TO,
UHH, CLAIM THAT-AH.

01:31.134 --> 01:32.570
RIGHT, RIGHT.

01:32.614 --> 01:35.791
UHH, CLAIM THAT-AH.

01:41.710 --> 01:44.930
A SPA DAY,
A CANDLELIT DINNER.

01:44.974 --> 01:48.064
IF YOUR PLAN WAS TO HELP ME
RELAX BEFORE THE TOURNAMENT,

01:48.108 --> 01:50.197
YOU SUCCEEDED.

01:50.240 --> 01:53.200
WELL, I'M NOT DONE.
CHECK YOUR PHONE.

01:53.243 --> 01:55.637
WHAT?

01:55.680 --> 01:58.422
YOU SENT ME AN INVITE
TO CREATE

01:58.466 --> 02:01.121
A SPOTIFY BLEND PLAYLIST.

02:01.164 --> 02:02.644
YUP. SO IN BETWEEN
YOUR MATCHES,

02:02.687 --> 02:04.646
YOU KNOW YOU
CAN GET IN THE ZONE

02:04.689 --> 02:06.778
WITH A MIX OF
YOUR FAVORITE SONGS,
A COUPLE OF MINE.

02:06.822 --> 02:09.955
SO IT'LL BE LIKE HAVING
YOU RIGHT THERE WITH ME,

02:09.999 --> 02:11.609
EVEN WHEN YOU'RE NOT.

02:11.653 --> 02:13.176
YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.224
HI.

02:17.267 --> 02:19.269
MOM. HEH! WHAT'S UP?

02:19.313 --> 02:21.010
UH, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

02:21.053 --> 02:23.012
WELL, I TOLD YOU
I WAS FLYING IN
FOR HOMECOMING.

02:23.055 --> 02:26.668
UH, YEAH. THE WEEKEND FOR
THE GAME AGAINST HAWKINS.

02:26.711 --> 02:30.889
WELL, I WANTED
TO GET MY FULL HBCU
HOMECOMING EXPERIENCE.

02:34.763 --> 02:37.287
WHICH SHOULD INCLUDE
AN INTRODUCTION

02:37.331 --> 02:38.767
TO YOUR COMPANION.
OH, RIGHT, RIGHT!

02:38.810 --> 02:41.813
HEH. MY BAD. UH, MA,
THIS IS THEA MAYS,

02:41.857 --> 02:43.250
MY GIRLFRIEND.

02:43.293 --> 02:46.514
I'VE HEARD
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.

02:46.557 --> 02:48.646
WELL, I WISH
I COULD SAY THE SAME.

02:48.690 --> 02:50.822
BUT I'M SURE
I WILL GET TO KNOW YOU

02:50.866 --> 02:53.260
JUST LIKE I'VE DONE WITH
ALL OF DAMON'S FRIENDS.

02:53.303 --> 02:57.133
AND HOW ARE J.R.,
SANTIAGO, AND SIMONE?

02:57.177 --> 03:00.310
GOOD. YEAH,
EVERYBODY'S GOOD.

03:00.354 --> 03:01.659
OH. THAT'S
REAL GOOD, BABY.

03:01.703 --> 03:02.660
UM...

03:02.704 --> 03:04.009
I SHOULD HEAD IN

03:04.053 --> 03:05.489
AND GET SOME SLEEP
BEFORE THE TOURNAMENT,

03:05.533 --> 03:07.665
BUT IT WAS SO NICE
TO MEET YOU.

03:07.709 --> 03:09.493
-SEE YOU SOON.
-SEE YOU.

03:09.537 --> 03:12.148
SEE YOU.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.411
YO, REALLY, MA?

03:14.455 --> 03:16.631
WHAT? ALL I DID WAS
ASK A QUESTION.

03:16.674 --> 03:21.418
NOW COME. MY HBCU
EXPERIENCE AWAITS.

03:26.641 --> 03:29.339
NOT BAD.

03:31.298 --> 03:33.256
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR YOU.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.997
CAN THIS WAIT
TILL MORNING?

03:35.040 --> 03:36.955
I GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

03:36.999 --> 03:39.088
DOES THAT WORK INVOLVE
THE MERGER WITH
WILLIS COBB UNIVERSITY?

03:39.131 --> 03:42.265
ZEKE,
HOW DID WE GET HERE?

03:42.309 --> 03:44.789
THE SAME WAY
OTHER HBCUs HAVE:

03:44.833 --> 03:47.618
LOW REVENUES
AND POOR ENROLLMENT.

03:47.662 --> 03:49.794
NOW, I KNOW EVERYONE
WILL PAINT ME AS THE VILLAIN.

03:49.838 --> 03:52.884
I DON'T CARE. I'VE TRIED
EVERYTHING I COULD.

03:52.928 --> 03:55.365
THIS MERGER IS THE ONLY
WAY TO SAVE BRINGSTON.

03:55.409 --> 03:58.499
EVEN IF WE LOSE THE HEART
AND SOUL OF OUR
SCHOOL IN THE PROCESS?

03:58.542 --> 04:00.936
WHAT'S THE POINT IN
SAVING BRINGSTON

04:00.979 --> 04:06.289
IF IT'S NOT
BRINGSTON ANYMORE?

04:19.128 --> 04:20.390
IT'S SO COOL...

04:20.434 --> 04:22.000
AND SCARY

04:22.044 --> 04:24.307
BEING AROUND
SO MANY WOMEN
I ADMIRE.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.266
I AGREE.

04:26.309 --> 04:27.963
MM-MM. PUT
THE FANGIRL AWAY

04:28.006 --> 04:29.791
BECAUSE THE PROS ARE
NOT FANS OF OURS.

04:29.834 --> 04:31.488
THEY SEE COLLEGIATE
PLAYERS

04:31.532 --> 04:33.838
AS UNNECESSARY
OBSTACLES, SO...

04:33.882 --> 04:36.188
TRUE. AND IF
WE HAD A CHOICE,

04:36.232 --> 04:38.539
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN STEP
ON THE COURT WITH US.

04:38.582 --> 04:41.237
KATIA, I WAS HOPING
YOU'D BE HERE.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.544
WHY? YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
GOOD ENOUGH TO BEAT ME,

04:43.587 --> 04:45.285
AND YOU NEVER WILL BE.

04:45.328 --> 04:47.591
IT'S A MISTAKE TO
UNDERESTIMATE ME.

04:47.635 --> 04:49.593
SWEETIE, IT'S
A LITTLE HARD

04:49.637 --> 04:51.465
TO TAKE YOU OR YOUR
FRIENDS SERIOUSLY

04:51.508 --> 04:54.032
IN YOUR LITTLE
MATCHING OUTFITS.

04:57.427 --> 05:00.038
THEA, AS YOUR FRIEND,

05:00.082 --> 05:01.736
I HATE HER.

05:01.779 --> 05:04.129
THAT'S THE NICEST
THING YOU'VE
EVER SAID TO ME.

05:04.173 --> 05:05.696

FEW DAYS CHEWING US OUT.

CANCELED LAST YEAR

HEY, YOU EVER FIGURE OUT HOW
YOU'RE GONNA TALK TO YOUR MOM?

08:39.693 --> 08:43.131
UH, YEAH. FOR NOW,
I'M JUST GONNA
TELL HER ABOUT CELINE

08:43.174 --> 08:44.611
AND NOT MY DAD.

08:44.654 --> 08:46.003
SO YOU'RE GONNA LIE?

08:46.047 --> 08:48.223
NAH. I'M JUST SKIPPING
A FEW DETAILS.

08:48.266 --> 08:50.573
HEY. WHEN I
MENTIONED THE TOURNAMENT AT

08:50.617 --> 08:52.575
FAMILY DINNER, I DIDN'T EXPECT
YOU GUYS TO COME SEE ME.

08:52.619 --> 08:56.100
ARE YOU KIDDING?
IT'S ABOUT TIME I FINALLY
GET TO SEE YOU PLAY.

08:56.144 --> 08:58.581
OH, YEAH, HEY.
YOU LOOKED GREAT OUT THERE.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.322
THANKS.

09:00.365 --> 09:01.366
HEY.

09:01.410 --> 09:02.716
HEY.

09:03.804 --> 09:07.198
SO I AM PLAYING
KATIA TOMORROW.

09:07.242 --> 09:10.071
WHAT?
YOU GONNA DESTROY HER.

09:10.114 --> 09:11.028
OH, YEAH.

09:11.072 --> 09:12.769
I'M GLAD YOU GOT
YOUR REMATCH.

09:12.813 --> 09:15.032
ME, TOO.
DAMON, I NEED FOOD.

09:15.076 --> 09:16.773
I GUESS WE SHOULD
GET YOU SOMETHING TO EAT.

09:16.817 --> 09:19.254
I'MMA SEE YOU ALL, THEN.

09:19.297 --> 09:21.517

BEEN KIND OF
AWKWARD FOR YOU.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.389
WHY?

09:24.433 --> 09:25.695
I'M HAPPY FOR THEM.

09:25.739 --> 09:26.914
SO...

09:26.957 --> 09:29.003
WE'RE PLAYING EACH OTHER
TOMORROW.

09:29.046 --> 09:31.048
WHAT? ARE YOU
SERIOUS?

09:31.092 --> 09:32.833
THAT'S
SO MESSED UP.

09:32.876 --> 09:34.791
I GET THAT PLAYING
YOUR FRIEND MUST SUCK,

09:34.835 --> 09:36.271
BUT THIS SEEMS A BIT EXTRA.

09:36.314 --> 09:39.448
NO. COACH LONI IS USING
THIS TOURNAMENT

09:39.491 --> 09:41.145
TO DETERMINE THE TOP 6.

09:41.189 --> 09:44.105
AND IF I DON'T WIN,
IT COULD POTENTIALLY
BE A WRAP ON ME

09:44.148 --> 09:46.107
OFFICIALLY PLAYING
TENNIS AT BRINGSTON
FOR THE YEAR.

09:46.150 --> 09:48.631
AND IF I DON'T BEAT
SIMONE, I COULD
LOSE MY SPOT,

09:48.675 --> 09:51.721
WHICH MEANS
THEY COULD PULL
MY SCHOLARSHIP.

09:51.765 --> 09:55.072
OK, UM, FORGET MY LAST
COMMENT.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.467
IF THE MERGER
GOES THROUGH,

09:58.510 --> 09:59.903
WE'RE GONNA HAVE

09:59.947 --> 10:02.253
FOR WILLIS COBB ALUMNI
ON THE WALLS.

10:02.297 --> 10:04.125
WHO EXACTLY ARE YOU
THINKING ABOUT ADDING?

10:04.168 --> 10:08.433
I HAVE A FEW NAMES:
GRANT VOS, KERRY SLATER,

10:08.477 --> 10:11.698
MAYBE CLARA RAMSEY.

10:13.569 --> 10:15.484
I DON'T KNOW
WHO THOSE PEOPLE ARE.

10:15.527 --> 10:19.140
THEY'RE AMONG
THE TOP 3 APP DEVELOPERS
IN THE COUNTRY.

10:19.183 --> 10:21.664
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

10:21.708 --> 10:23.753
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY
TALKING ABOUT

10:23.797 --> 10:25.929
PUTTING UP PORTRAITS
OF APP DEVELOPERS

10:25.973 --> 10:28.366
NEXT TO ALICE WALKER,
TONI MORRISON,

10:28.410 --> 10:30.151
AND ZORA NEALE HURSTON?

10:30.194 --> 10:31.543
HELLO, AMARA.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.676
I HEARD YOU'VE BEEN SNOOPING
WHERE YOU DIDN'T BELONG

10:33.720 --> 10:35.591
AND FOUND OUT
ABOUT THE MERGER.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.506
WELL, SOMEBODY
HAS TO STOP YOU

10:37.549 --> 10:39.290
FROM DILUTING
THE HBCU LEGACY.

10:39.334 --> 10:41.075
LIKE IT OR NOT,

10:41.118 --> 10:43.773
BRINGSTON'S GONNA HAVE
TO BECOME MORE INCLUSIVE.

10:43.817 --> 10:46.297
YOU MEAN MORE WHITE.

10:46.341 --> 10:48.343
ZEKE, HELP ME OUT HERE.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.608
THIS PLACE HAS GIVEN
INSPIRATION

10:52.652 --> 10:54.349
TO GENERATIONS OF STUDENTS.

10:55.698 --> 10:58.483
I REFUSE TO TAKE
THAT AWAY.

10:58.527 --> 11:00.660
EVERYTHING STAYS AS IS.

11:00.703 --> 11:03.663
THANK YOU,
PRESIDENT ALLEN.

11:10.495 --> 11:11.932
YEAH, WE'VE
GOT A GREAT GROUP
OF YOUNG MEN.

11:11.975 --> 11:13.673
THEY LOVE
TO COMPETE.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.239
THEY COME OUT HERE
AND BUST IT
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

11:15.283 --> 11:16.806
THE GUYS ARE
REALLY TALENTED.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.678
WRECK-IT RALPH.

11:18.721 --> 11:20.114
YOU SNIFFING
AROUND HERE AGAIN?

11:20.157 --> 11:22.203
WELL, GIVEN THAT IT'S
THE ANNIVERSARY OF

11:22.246 --> 11:24.205
THE BASEBALL CHEATING SCANDAL,
I'M DOING A STORY ON THE TEAM.

11:24.248 --> 11:26.686
YEAH. HE'S DOING ONE
OF THOSE "LOOK HOW
FAR THEY'VE COME"

11:26.729 --> 11:27.817
KIND OF DEALS.

11:27.861 --> 11:29.732
IS THAT RIGHT? SOUNDS GOOD,

11:29.776 --> 11:31.516
AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT
REHASHING THE SCANDAL.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.823
WELL, I CAN'T REALLY
WRITE A STORY ABOUT
HOW FAR YOU'VE COME

11:33.867 --> 11:35.782
WITHOUT LOOKING AT
HOW YOU GOT HERE.

11:35.825 --> 11:38.349
I CAN TELL YOU. SHAW.
END OF STORY.

11:38.393 --> 11:40.961
NO, THERE'S, UH,
STILL A MISSING PIECE,

11:41.004 --> 11:42.832
THE IDENTITY OF
AMARA'S SOURCE.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.616
YOU'RE GONNA WANT
TO LEAVE THE SCANDAL

11:44.660 --> 11:46.531
AND ALL THIS WHISTLEBLOWER
STUFF IN THE PAST,
DO YOU HEAR ME?

11:46.575 --> 11:48.011
MARCUS, I'M TRYING
TO HELP YOU.

11:48.055 --> 11:50.753
STAY THE HELL AWAY
FROM MY STAFF AND TEAM.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.537
THAT'S HOW YOU CAN HELP.

11:52.581 --> 11:54.801
UH, YEAH.

11:59.066 --> 12:00.284
WHAT THE HELL WERE
Y'ALL THINKING?

12:00.328 --> 12:01.764
WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
WRONG HERE.

12:01.808 --> 12:05.072
I DISAGREE. YOU OWE ME
AN APOLOGY, OK,

12:05.115 --> 12:08.728
FOR GOING BEHIND
MY BACK, TALKING TO
A REPORTER ABOUT ME!

12:08.771 --> 12:13.776
ABOUT YOU? WERE
WE JUST PART OF
THE SAME CONVERSATION?

12:13.820 --> 12:15.691
I MEAN, COME ON, MARCUS.
YOU'RE LOSING IT.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.215
YOU KNOW WHAT?
CLEAN OUT YOUR OFFICES.
YOU BOTH ARE FIRED.

12:18.259 --> 12:19.913
-WHAT?!
-BOTH OF YOU.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.218
-NO, YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.
-MARCUS.

12:21.262 --> 12:26.397
I AM. GET OUT OF
MY GYM NOW.

12:33.056 --> 12:35.319
SO, YEAH, TENNIS
HAS GIVEN ME A LOT.

12:35.363 --> 12:37.887
I'VE BEEN ABLE
TO SEE THE WORLD,

12:37.931 --> 12:39.759
AND I ENJOY MAKING
PEOPLE SEE ME

12:39.802 --> 12:41.499
AND WOMEN WHO LOOK LIKE ME.

12:43.153 --> 12:45.329
I'M SORRY. YOU ASKED
ABOUT ME PERSONALLY,

12:45.373 --> 12:47.897
AND ALL I'VE TALKED
ABOUT IS TENNIS.

12:47.941 --> 12:50.073
YOU'VE ANSWERED
MY QUESTIONS.

12:51.118 --> 12:52.815
YOU'RE DISCIPLINED

12:52.859 --> 12:55.035
AND AMBITIOUS.

12:55.078 --> 12:58.473
AND SINCE YOU CARRY
THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD
ON YOUR SHOULDERS,

12:58.516 --> 13:02.042
SOMETIMES YOU CAN BE
A LITTLE INTENSE,

13:02.085 --> 13:05.349
BUT YOU'RE LEARNING
TO TONE IT DOWN.

13:05.393 --> 13:06.394
YEAH.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.093
I GET IT NOW.

13:10.137 --> 13:11.616
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT

13:11.660 --> 13:13.705
THE KEENA SIMS STAMP OF
APPROVAL IN RECORD TIME.

13:13.749 --> 13:15.185
SHUT UP.

13:15.229 --> 13:17.100
GREAT. WELL, THEN I'M
GONNA QUIT WHILE I'M AHEAD

13:17.144 --> 13:19.668
AND SAY GOOD NIGHT,
BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR DINNER.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.061
IT WAS MY PLEASURE.

13:21.104 --> 13:23.063
-ALL RIGHT.
-ALL RIGHT. SEE YOU.

13:26.370 --> 13:27.458
BYE.

13:28.895 --> 13:29.852
HEY.

13:29.896 --> 13:31.114
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

13:31.158 --> 13:32.986
AND DON'T YOU SAY
"NOTHING."

13:33.029 --> 13:35.597
OTHERWISE WE WILL SIT
HERE UNTIL YOU SPILL.

13:40.645 --> 13:42.386
I FOUND MY BIRTH MOTHER...

13:45.737 --> 13:47.609
CELINE RAYMOND,

13:47.652 --> 13:49.480
J.R.'s MOM.

13:54.921 --> 13:57.575
AND J.R.'s DAD...

13:59.882 --> 14:01.753
HE'S YOUR BIRTH FATHER?

14:01.797 --> 14:04.017
NO.

14:04.060 --> 14:06.976
OH. OK.

14:07.020 --> 14:09.631
WELL, WHO IS?

14:10.893 --> 14:12.721
DAMON...

14:12.764 --> 14:17.726
SWEETHEART, EITHER
YOU TRUST ME WITH
THIS, OR YOU DON'T.

14:17.769 --> 14:20.120
WHO IS YOUR FATHER?

14:40.967 --> 14:42.925
DAD'S MY BIOLOGICAL FATHER.

14:47.103 --> 14:49.540
DAMON, THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

14:49.584 --> 14:52.021
HE DIDN'T TELL YOU, MOM,
'CAUSE HE AIN'T
WANT TO ADMIT THAT--

14:52.065 --> 14:54.589
ADMIT WHAT, DAMON?

15:01.596 --> 15:04.251
HE DIDN'T WANT TO ADMIT
THAT HE HAD AN AFFAIR

15:04.294 --> 15:06.601
WHEN YOU GUYS
WERE NEWLYWEDS.

15:09.952 --> 15:12.302
I'M ASSUMING CELINE
TOLD YOU THIS.

15:14.522 --> 15:17.264
WELL, I'M NOT TAKING
THE WORD OF SOME WOMAN
I'VE NEVER MET.

15:17.307 --> 15:21.398
XAVIER WOULD NEVER BE
UNFAITHFUL TO ME.

15:21.442 --> 15:24.401
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF
GAME CELINE IS PLAYING,

15:24.445 --> 15:27.317
BUT, UH, I'M GOING TO NEED
HER NUMBER RIGHT NOW.

15:27.361 --> 15:30.059
DAMON, I'M NOT PLAYING.

15:30.103 --> 15:33.236
CELINE MAY BE YOUR
BIOLOGICAL MOTHER,

15:33.280 --> 15:35.673
BUT XAVIER IS NOT
YOUR BIRTH FATHER.

15:35.717 --> 15:39.068
HE AND I ADOPTED YOU,
PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

15:39.112 --> 15:41.201
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
THE PAPERWORK, MA?

15:43.725 --> 15:46.467
XAVIER HANDLED THE ADOPTION.

15:48.077 --> 15:50.471
WE WANTED A BABY SO BADLY,

15:50.514 --> 15:52.908
I DIDN'T CARE ABOUT
THE PAPERWORK.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.823
SO WHENEVER WE NEEDED IT,

15:54.866 --> 15:56.564
YOUR FATHER JUST
TOOK CARE OF IT.

15:56.607 --> 15:59.045
MOM, HE DID THAT TO HIDE
THE FACT THAT THERE
WAS NO ADOPTION.

15:59.088 --> 16:00.742
NO.

16:00.785 --> 16:02.918
ALL RIGHT, HE DIDN'T NEED
TO ADOPT HIS OWN SON, MOM.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.615
NO, NO, NO. WE CANNOT
TAKE THE WORD OF SOME
WOMAN I HAVE NEVER MET.

16:04.659 --> 16:06.617
LISTEN, LISTEN,
LISTEN, MOM.

16:06.661 --> 16:08.576
ALL RIGHT? I CHECKED
WITH THE STATE.

16:08.619 --> 16:11.579
THERE IS NO RECORD OF
MY ADOPTION AT ALL
BY ANYONE.

16:11.622 --> 16:15.539
I KNOW IT'S HARD,
BUT IT'S THE TRUTH.

16:18.064 --> 16:20.544
I GOT TO GO. UH,
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

16:20.588 --> 16:21.632

I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

18:50.477 --> 18:52.435
BRINGSTON IS
MERGING WITH A PWI.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.698
OK, WE NEED TO GET
THIS ARTICLE OUT
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

18:54.742 --> 18:56.613
I THINK WE SHOULD
HOLD A BEAT.

18:56.657 --> 18:58.441
AMARA, PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT
TO KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING.

18:58.485 --> 19:01.227
I AGREE. BUT I DON'T
WANT TO PUBLICLY AIR

19:01.270 --> 19:04.621
BRINGSTON CONTROVERSY
AGAIN JUST TO STAND BY
AND WATCH THE AFTERMATH.

19:04.665 --> 19:07.146
HEY, LOOK, I GET IT. AFTER
THE CHEATING SCANDAL,

19:07.189 --> 19:09.148
PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY
CAME AT YOU PRETTY HARD.

19:09.191 --> 19:11.019
MY HESITATION ISN'T
ABOUT THAT.

19:11.062 --> 19:12.803
IT'S ABOUT SAVING BRINGSTON.

19:12.847 --> 19:14.631
WE NEED TO BE STRATEGIC--

19:14.675 --> 19:16.807
RELEASE THE ARTICLE
WHEN WE KNOW WE CAN BRING

19:16.851 --> 19:19.636
AWARENESS AND ALLIES
TO OUR CAUSE.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.856
OK. WE DO THIS
YOUR WAY FOR NOW.

19:32.997 --> 19:34.564
HEY, CANDACE, IT'S ME.

19:34.608 --> 19:37.437
WE NEED TO HIT UP EVERY
ALUM AT HOMECOMING.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.787
THERE'S SOMETHING
THEY NEED TO KNOW.

19:39.830 --> 19:42.746
I TOLD YOU TO
STAY AWAY FROM MY TEAM.

19:42.790 --> 19:45.314
DIDN'T I MAKE
MYSELF CLEAR?

19:45.358 --> 19:47.316
WHAT WAS MADE CLEAR
WAS THAT YOU WERE

19:47.360 --> 19:49.057
AMARA'S SOURCE ON
THE CHEATING SCANDAL.

19:49.100 --> 19:50.450
YOU NEED TO LEAVE.

19:50.493 --> 19:51.886
WHEN I MENTIONED
THE WHISTLEBLOWER YESTERDAY,

19:51.929 --> 19:53.104
YOU NEARLY TOOK MY HEAD OFF.

19:53.148 --> 19:54.497
AND THAT GOT ME THINKING,

19:54.541 --> 19:56.064
SEE, YOU WERE SHAW'S
ASSISTANT COACH.

19:56.107 --> 19:57.935
THERE'S NO WAY YOU DIDN'T
KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING.

19:57.979 --> 20:00.242
YOU HAD ACCESS TO EVERYTHING
THAT YOU NEEDED TO EXPOSE HIM,

20:00.286 --> 20:03.985
AND YOU HAD ACCESS
TO THE PERFECT PERSON
TO HIDE BEHIND,

20:04.028 --> 20:05.378
AMARA.

20:05.421 --> 20:06.857
YOU LET HER
STAND OUT THERE

20:06.901 --> 20:09.295
AND TAKE THE HITS
ON THIS ONE ALONE.

20:09.338 --> 20:12.036
NOW, I KNOW. AMARA,
SHE PROBABLY TOLD YOU
SHE COULD HANDLE IT,

20:12.080 --> 20:13.734
BUT SHE SHOULDN'T
HAVE HAD TO.

20:13.777 --> 20:17.868
TEAMS ARE BUILT
ON TRUST, RIGHT?

20:17.912 --> 20:21.481
IT MEANS ALL THIS,
ALL THIS IS A LIE.

20:21.524 --> 20:23.874
AH, BUT NONE OF THAT
MATTERS TO YOU

20:23.918 --> 20:26.355
AS LONG AS YOU WIN

20:26.399 --> 20:28.488
THE GIRL AND THE TEAM.

20:36.539 --> 20:38.585
CAN I SEE THE MIC?

20:41.240 --> 20:42.763
HEY, HEY, EVERYBODY.

20:42.806 --> 20:45.331
LISTEN, I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL
FOR COMING OUT.

20:45.374 --> 20:47.376
WHOO!

20:48.899 --> 20:52.381
YEAH. I HOPE YOU ALL
ARE HAVING A GREAT TIME,

20:52.425 --> 20:55.166
BUT THERE'S AN ELEPHANT
IN THE ROOM,

20:55.210 --> 20:57.299
AND IT HAS CHEATING SCANDAL
WRITTEN ALL OVER IT.

20:57.343 --> 21:01.434
NOW, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK
ABOUT AN ANONYMOUS SOURCE,

21:01.477 --> 21:05.873
WHO THEY ARE AND WHY THEY
DID WHAT THEY DID.

21:05.916 --> 21:09.616
AND I WANT TO PUT ALL THAT
TO REST HERE AND NOW.

21:12.183 --> 21:14.577
IT WAS ME.

21:16.100 --> 21:18.755
NOW, I KNOW WHAT
YOU ALL THINKING, ALL RIGHT?

21:18.799 --> 21:21.976
I CAN HEAR IT.
BUT I'M NOT THE BAD GUY.

21:22.019 --> 21:26.415
I DID WHAT I DID SO YOU BOYS
CAN WALK ON THAT FIELD

21:26.459 --> 21:28.765
WITH YOUR HEADS HELD HIGH.

21:28.809 --> 21:31.768
NOW, I DID THE RIGHT THING,
DAMN IT.

21:31.812 --> 21:35.206
THIS TIME, I GOT IT RIGHT.

21:35.250 --> 21:38.122
BUT I'M NOT THE BAD GUY.

21:38.166 --> 21:42.997
BAD GUY...BAD GUY...BAD GUY...

21:45.826 --> 21:50.047
YOU GUYS, MAN, HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME--

21:50.091 --> 21:54.182
TO WAKE UP EVERY MORNING
AND TO LOOK IN THAT MIRROR

21:54.225 --> 21:58.229
AND FEEL BETRAYED BY WHAT I SEE.

21:58.273 --> 22:01.711
I CAN'T UNSEE IT.

22:05.193 --> 22:08.327
I CAN'T UNSEE ME, MAN.

22:10.154 --> 22:12.940
I'M NOT A BAD MAN, Y'ALL.

22:12.983 --> 22:14.463
I'M NOT.

22:14.507 --> 22:16.378
COACH, LET'S GET
SOME FOOD, ALL RIGHT?

22:16.422 --> 22:18.249
I STILL GOT STUFF
TO SAY, SIMS.

22:18.293 --> 22:20.339
I HAVE TO GET IT OUT.

22:20.382 --> 22:21.427
I HAVE TO QUIET
THE NOISE, J.

22:21.470 --> 22:22.993
I GOT TO QUIET THE NOISE.

22:23.037 --> 22:24.473
LET'S JUST TAKE A BREAK
FOR A SECOND, ALL RIGHT...

22:24.517 --> 22:26.345
AND THEN YOU CAN TAKE
THE MIC BACK.

22:26.388 --> 22:31.480
YOU HAPPY NOW, HUH, RALPH?
HUH? HUH?

22:31.524 --> 22:33.482
COACH, COACH, COACH...

22:33.526 --> 22:35.179
-LET ME GO.
-COACH, CALM DOWN.

22:35.223 --> 22:39.358
I'M FINE. I'M FINE,
DAMON. J., I'M FINE, OK?

22:39.401 --> 22:41.098
I'M FINE, OK?

22:46.669 --> 22:48.584
COACH.

22:57.767 --> 23:00.161
I HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT
WHERE CREDIT IS DUE.

23:00.204 --> 23:01.467
YOU'VE BEEN DOMINATING.

23:01.510 --> 23:03.251
THANK YOU.

23:03.294 --> 23:04.948
YOU'RE NEXT.

23:06.123 --> 23:08.778
YOU STILL HAVE A LOT
TO LEARN, LITTLE GIRL.

23:25.491 --> 23:27.231
THEA, YOU OK?

23:27.275 --> 23:30.539
LOOK. SHE...

23:39.113 --> 23:44.031
WOW. SO MUCH FOR BEING
A MAN OF INTEGRITY.

23:44.074 --> 23:45.902
DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

23:45.946 --> 23:49.602
COME ON, FELLAS.
COACH SHOWED MAD INTEGRITY.

23:49.645 --> 23:52.953
SHAW WAS CHEATING.
HE WAS ROBBING DUDES
OF THEIR EDUCATION.

23:52.996 --> 23:55.216
COACH MARCUS, HE DID
THE RIGHT THING.

23:55.259 --> 23:58.567
NO. KEEPING THIS THING QUIET,
FORCING SHAW OUT,

23:58.611 --> 24:00.003
OR GOING
TO THE ADMINISTRATION,

24:00.047 --> 24:01.701
THAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN THE RIGHT THING.

24:01.744 --> 24:03.354
WE WOULD'VE STILL HAD
A SEASON LAST YEAR,

24:03.398 --> 24:05.269
AND OUR FUNDING WOULDN'T BE
IN QUESTION THIS YEAR.

24:05.313 --> 24:07.097
HEY, LOOK, OUR OPINION
ABOUT WHAT COACH DID

24:07.141 --> 24:08.838
ISN'T MORE IMPORTANT
THAN FINDING HIM.

24:08.882 --> 24:10.753
CLEARLY, HE NEEDS
OUR HELP.

24:10.797 --> 24:13.277
I'M NOT HELPING A DUDE
I CAN'T TRUST,

24:13.321 --> 24:15.062
SO YOU DO WHAT YOU
GOT TO DO.

24:15.105 --> 24:16.063
COME ON, BOYS.

24:16.106 --> 24:17.586
-YO.
-NO.

24:17.630 --> 24:18.848
SO AFTER ALL
WE BEEN THROUGH,

24:18.892 --> 24:20.894
OUR TEAM IS BACK
BEING DIVIDED?

24:20.937 --> 24:22.591
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BEAT
HAWKINS THIS WAY?

24:22.635 --> 24:24.506
ALL RIGHT.
LOOK, LISTEN UP.

24:24.550 --> 24:25.942
WE'LL FIND COACH
FIRST,

24:25.986 --> 24:27.814
AND THEN WE'LL
FIX THE TEAM.

24:27.857 --> 24:30.338
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S SPLIT UP.
CHECK EVERYWHERE.

24:30.381 --> 24:32.775
IF YOU FIND HIM,
HIT ME UP.

24:32.819 --> 24:34.951
THIS WAS KATIA.

24:34.995 --> 24:38.825
SHE KNOWS I CAN BEAT HER,
SO SHE SABOTAGED ME.

24:38.868 --> 24:40.609
SO WHY GO THROUGH
ALL THIS TROUBLE

24:40.653 --> 24:42.568
IF YOU CAN JUST USE
A DIFFERENT RACKET?

24:42.611 --> 24:44.439
ARE YOU BEING SERIOUS
RIGHT NOW?

24:44.483 --> 24:45.788
FOR ELITE TENNIS PLAYERS,

24:45.832 --> 24:48.269
THE SPECIFICS OF THEIR
RACKET ARE VERY KEY.

24:48.312 --> 24:50.837
WEIGHT, HANDLE, GRIP,

24:50.880 --> 24:53.492
STRING GAUGE ARE
ALL PRECISELY SELECTED

24:53.535 --> 24:56.190
TO MEET OUR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS
AND TO MAXIMIZE PERFORMANCE.

24:56.233 --> 24:57.844
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M GOING
TO SAY THIS,

24:57.887 --> 24:59.236
BUT I HAVE TO FORFEIT.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.803
THE HELL YOU ARE.

25:00.847 --> 25:02.805
GIRL, YOU'RE GONNA
BORROW MY RACKET.

25:02.849 --> 25:06.374
WHAT, AND MAKE A FOOL
OF MYSELF ON THE COURT?

25:06.417 --> 25:08.376
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

25:08.419 --> 25:10.378
WHAT, THEN YOU'RE
JUST GONNA LET
KATIA WIN?

25:10.421 --> 25:12.293
AND IF ANYONE CAN
PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT RACKET,

25:12.336 --> 25:13.512
IT IS YOU.

25:13.555 --> 25:16.079
THEA,
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT.

25:16.123 --> 25:18.342
YOU ALWAYS TELL ME THAT
TENNIS IS A MENTAL GAME.

25:18.386 --> 25:19.866
SO, GIRL, HERE WE ARE.

25:19.909 --> 25:21.868
YOU NEED TO WOMAN UP.

25:23.043 --> 25:26.263
AS FAR AS PEP TALKS GO,
THAT WASN'T BAD.

25:26.307 --> 25:29.440
YOU'RE WELCOME.

25:29.484 --> 25:30.703
HERE.

25:34.097 --> 25:36.447
GO PRACTICE.

25:36.491 --> 25:37.579
OK.

25:37.623 --> 25:39.102
KILL IT.

25:41.148 --> 25:42.105
YEAH.

25:42.149 --> 25:43.890
DAMON, UM...

25:43.933 --> 25:45.674
YOU GOT TO GET DOWN
TO THE TOURNAMENT.

25:45.718 --> 25:47.546
THEA NEEDS YOU RIGHT NOW.

25:47.589 --> 25:49.896
OH, ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
THEN I'M ON MY WAY.

25:52.463 --> 25:55.466
NO CAP. HOW HARD WAS IT
TO MAKE THAT CALL?

25:57.207 --> 25:59.296
THE HARDEST.

26:06.042 --> 26:07.609
GOT A QUESTION.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.480
WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN
YOU AND KEISHA?

26:09.524 --> 26:12.875
GOT AN ANSWER:
DAMN, YOU NOSEY.

26:12.919 --> 26:14.616
CAN'T WE JUST
SKIP AHEAD TO THE PART

26:14.660 --> 26:16.009
WHERE YOU JUST
TELL ME ALREADY?

26:16.052 --> 26:17.619
NAH. WHY DON'T WE
CHILL AT THE SPOT

26:17.663 --> 26:19.403
WHERE YOU MIND
YOUR BUSINESS, YEAH?

26:19.447 --> 26:22.493
NOPE 'CAUSE THE WAY SHE
WAS LOOKING AT YOU YESTERDAY,

26:22.537 --> 26:23.973
HER ENCOURAGING ME
TO BID ON YOU AT

26:24.017 --> 26:25.932
THE BLACK AND WHITE GALA
SO THAT YOU

26:25.975 --> 26:28.412
COULD PERFORM WITH
THE ATLs, SOMETHING'S UP.

26:28.456 --> 26:31.851
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
KEISHA'S THE REASON
THAT YOU--

26:34.201 --> 26:36.769
I PUT MYSELF OUT THERE,
AND SHE REJECTED ME.

26:36.812 --> 26:38.509
AND NOW SHE'S SAYING
SHE'S READY,

26:38.553 --> 26:40.816
BUT I CAN'T PUT MYSELF
THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

26:40.860 --> 26:43.471
CAN WE
GET BACK TO WORK NOW?

26:43.514 --> 26:45.604
YOU HAPPY?

26:45.647 --> 26:48.084
ACTUALLY, I GOT TO ROLL.

26:48.128 --> 26:51.914
I WILL MAKE SURE THAT
I TEXT YOU ABOUT
REHEARSAL TONIGHT.

26:51.958 --> 26:54.787
AND, CAM, IT PROBABLY
TOOK A LOT FOR KEISHA

26:54.830 --> 26:57.877
TO FINALLY SAY THAT SHE'S
READY AND OWN HER CRAP.

26:57.920 --> 27:00.662
SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD
BELIEVE HER.

27:06.799 --> 27:08.670
WELL, SHE'LL BE HERE SOON.
OH, HERE SHE IS.

27:08.714 --> 27:09.932
LISTEN UP, GUYS.

27:09.976 --> 27:11.455
THANKS FOR COMING,
Y'ALL.

27:11.499 --> 27:14.937
I KNOW BRINGSTON MERGING
WITH A PWI IS A SHOCK.

27:14.981 --> 27:17.287
ZEKE'S ONE OF US. HOW
COULD HE LET THIS HAPPEN?

27:17.331 --> 27:19.899
WHEN WE'RE DONE, I'M
PAYING HIM A LITTLE VISIT.

27:19.942 --> 27:22.641
OK. BEFORE YOU ALL START
LIGHTING THE TORCHES,

27:22.684 --> 27:24.033
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

27:24.077 --> 27:26.296
WHEN ZEKE REACHES OUT
FOR DONATIONS,

27:26.340 --> 27:30.649
HOW MANY OF YOU SHOW UP TO
SUPPORT BRINGSTON FINANCIALLY?

27:30.692 --> 27:34.957
BUT WHEN IT'S HOMECOMING WEEK
FILLED WITH PARTIES AND FOOD,

27:35.001 --> 27:36.350
OH, Y'ALL SHOW UP
FOR THAT.

27:36.393 --> 27:38.178
DAMN. YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO PUT IT LIKE THAT.

27:38.221 --> 27:43.139
I SEE A ROOM FULL OF SUCCESSFUL,
WELL-CONNECTED PEOPLE.

27:43.183 --> 27:46.795
TAP YOUR CONTACTS. LET'S RAISE
ENOUGH MONEY TO STOP THIS.

27:46.839 --> 27:49.450
LET'S SAVE BRINGSTON.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.149
YEAH.

27:53.193 --> 27:55.021
YO, THANKS
FOR HITTING ME UP.

27:55.064 --> 27:57.806
YEAH. IT'S NO PROBLEM.

27:57.850 --> 28:00.374
THEA NEEDED ALL THE HELP
THAT SHE CAN GET,

28:00.417 --> 28:04.160
SO, PLUS, I'VE NEVER
SEEN HER LIKE THAT BEFORE.

28:07.076 --> 28:09.949
REMEMBER WHEN I SAID WE
COULDN'T SUPPORT EACH OTHER?

28:09.992 --> 28:13.822
UH, YES. KIND OF
HARD TO FORGET.

28:13.866 --> 28:16.695
WELL, I FEEL LIKE
THAT WASN'T RIGHT.

28:16.738 --> 28:19.828
AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I LEARNED THESE
LAST COUPLE DAYS,

28:19.872 --> 28:22.091
IT'S THAT WE ALL
NEED EACH OTHER.

28:22.135 --> 28:25.312
SO IF YOU EVER WANT TO TALK,
I'M HERE TO LISTEN.

28:29.533 --> 28:33.494
UH, YEAH, THESE PAST
FEW WEEKS HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE CRAZY.

28:33.537 --> 28:37.759
SO I'M GUESSING YOU
TALKED TO YOUR MOM ABOUT
CELINE AND YOUR DAD.

28:37.803 --> 28:39.761
J.R. CALLED ME UP.

28:39.805 --> 28:43.069
RIGHT. HEH.

28:43.112 --> 28:45.201
YOU KNOW, IF I WASN'T
SO DETERMINED

28:45.245 --> 28:47.029
ON FINDING
MY BIRTH PARENTS,

28:47.073 --> 28:48.552
NONE OF THIS WOULD'VE
CAME OUT

28:48.596 --> 28:52.078
AND MY MOM, SHE WOULDN'T
BE IN PAIN RIGHT NOW.

28:52.121 --> 28:57.866
DAMON, THIS IS NOT ON YOU.
THIS IS ON YOUR DAD.

28:57.910 --> 29:00.869
I WANT TO CONFRONT HIM
SO FREAKING BAD,

29:00.913 --> 29:03.872
BUT I CAN'T.

29:03.916 --> 29:06.222
'CAUSE
OF HIS ALZHEIMER'S,

29:06.266 --> 29:08.050
HE'LL NEVER
BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE

29:08.094 --> 29:10.400
FOR THE MESSED-UP STUFF
THAT HE DID.

29:10.444 --> 29:13.229
WELL, FOR WHATEVER REASON
HE DID WHAT HE DID,

29:13.273 --> 29:17.930
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
YOU KNOW HE LOVES YOU.

29:17.973 --> 29:20.759
SO HOLD ON TO THAT.

29:20.802 --> 29:23.239
YEAH. THANKS.

29:23.283 --> 29:24.197
MM-HMM.

29:24.240 --> 29:25.851
YOU KNOW,
IT WAS PRETTY DOPE

29:25.894 --> 29:28.897
YOU BEING HERE
FOR ME AND THEA

29:28.941 --> 29:31.247
DESPITE, YOU KNOW...

29:31.291 --> 29:33.989
DAMON, WE BOTH CAN BE
ADULTS ABOUT IT.

29:34.033 --> 29:36.165
FROM THE MOMENT WE MET,

29:36.209 --> 29:38.907
THERE WAS ALWAYS
SOMETHING BETWEEN US.

29:38.951 --> 29:41.867
YEAH. NO CAP.

29:43.303 --> 29:45.827
BUT YOU GOT JORDAN, AND
I GOT TO RESPECT THAT.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.176
AND NOW YOU'RE WITH THEA,

29:47.220 --> 29:49.178
SO WE'RE BACK
TO BEING FRIENDS...

29:50.919 --> 29:54.836
UNCOMPLICATED FRIENDS.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.403
YEAH.

29:56.446 --> 29:58.579
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

29:58.622 --> 30:00.450
HEY. UM...

30:02.017 --> 30:05.455
DO YOU EVER WONDER
WHAT THINGS WOULD'VE
BEEN LIKE BETWEEN US,

30:05.499 --> 30:08.154
LIKE, HAD THE TIMING
BEEN DIFFERENT?

30:11.635 --> 30:13.812
ALL THE TIME.

30:42.014 --> 30:43.319
FAULT.

30:53.112 --> 30:56.463
DOUBLE FAULT,
POINT, HOOK.

30:56.506 --> 30:57.638
0-15.

31:00.902 --> 31:02.904
THAT'S OK.
YOU GOT THIS.

OBNOXIOUSLY HEAVY,

31:51.213 --> 31:52.998
AND I DON'T

31:53.041 --> 31:55.000
UM...

32:05.880 --> 32:09.362

32:09.405 --> 32:15.585

32:17.109 --> 32:20.286
XAVIER'S AFFAIR IS
A WOUND

32:20.329 --> 32:22.288
THAT WILL TAKE
SOME TIME.

32:22.331 --> 32:25.117
YEAH. SIMONE TOLD ME
I SHOULD FOCUS

32:25.160 --> 32:26.727
ON THE FACT THAT HE LOVES ME.

32:26.770 --> 32:30.687
I AGREE. YOU SHOULD FOCUS
ON THE BEST IN HIM.

32:30.731 --> 32:31.993
MA, CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

32:32.037 --> 32:34.778
HMM?

32:34.822 --> 32:37.259
LIKE, WHEN YOU
LOOK AT ME NOW,

32:37.303 --> 32:39.522
DO YOU JUST SEE
THE WORST IN HIM?

32:39.566 --> 32:41.524
NEVER.

32:41.568 --> 32:48.227
DAMON, BABY, YOU ARE
MY BRIGHT LIGHT,

32:48.270 --> 32:51.534
THE BEST THING THAT'S
EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

32:51.578 --> 32:54.320
AND WE'LL ALWAYS
LOVE YOU.

32:55.712 --> 32:59.716
NOW, XAVIER
AND CELINE'S MESS

32:59.760 --> 33:02.154
WILL NEVER CHANGE THAT.

33:02.197 --> 33:03.807
YOU HEAR ME?

33:03.851 --> 33:05.244
YEAH.

33:06.680 --> 33:09.378
JUST LIKE IT'LL NEVER CHANGE
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE MY MA...

33:11.424 --> 33:13.992
AND YOU ALWAYS WILL BE.

33:18.605 --> 33:22.130
SO YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT HAPPENED

33:22.174 --> 33:24.002
WITH YOU AND CAM EARLIER?

33:24.045 --> 33:26.439
UHH...

33:26.482 --> 33:28.832
IT'S A SHORT BUT EPIC STORY.

33:28.876 --> 33:30.269
OK.

33:30.312 --> 33:33.315
I TOOK MY SHOT, BUT HE'S
MOVED ON EMOTIONALLY.

33:33.359 --> 33:36.101
IT WAS JUST BAD TIMING,
I GUESS.

33:36.144 --> 33:37.537
YEAH.

33:37.580 --> 33:39.930
SOMETIMES TIMING
IS AN ISSUE,

33:39.974 --> 33:44.065
AND OTHER TIMES, IT'S
JUST NEEDING TO FIGHT
FOR YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

33:44.109 --> 33:49.505
I'LL NEVER REGRET
GOING TO L.A.
TO FIGHT FOR JORDAN

33:49.549 --> 33:51.899
BECAUSE NOW I KNOW IT
WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE.

33:51.942 --> 33:54.293
BUT, HONESTLY, KEISH,
DO YOU REALLY THINK

33:54.336 --> 33:56.991
THAT YOU PUT ALL
YOUR CARDS ON THE TABLE
FOR YOU AND CAM?

33:58.688 --> 34:00.951
OH, MY GOD.

34:00.995 --> 34:02.344
WHAT?

34:02.388 --> 34:04.781
COACH LONI WANTS
TO SEE ME.

THE FINAL TOP 6.

34:17.098 --> 34:18.273

THING TO DO.

34:31.243 --> 34:34.855
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
THAT'S ENOUGH TO STOP
THE MERGER, RIGHT?

34:38.380 --> 34:41.209
UNFORTUNATELY, WE'RE GONNA
NEED A LOT MORE THAN THAT NOW.

34:46.954 --> 34:49.435

GAVE ME A HEADS-UP.

35:17.593 --> 35:20.944
SHE SAID I PUT IN THE WORK,
BUT IT JUST WASN'T ENOUGH,

35:20.988 --> 35:22.207
SO...

35:23.295 --> 35:25.819
I DIDN'T MAKE IT
INTO THE TOP 6.

ABOUT YOUR DAD?

36:40.241 --> 36:42.200
I DON'T KNOW.

36:42.243 --> 36:47.074
MAYBE BECAUSE YOU'RE
