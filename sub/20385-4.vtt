It's a safe deposit box.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.591
Number 1606.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.793
My guess,
they stashed the stamp there.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.695
What about the key?
Wouldn't I need the...

04:54.728 --> 04:56.530
Lost when you redecorated
the study, tell him.

04:56.830 --> 04:57.831
Oh.

down from Bemidji.

got a lot of time here.

Oh, should be back in a snap,
Milly. Uh...

06:38.499 --> 06:41.535

You're fine.

is the thing, to my box.

Hate to be a stickler, ES,
but, uh, without the key,

07:31.952 --> 07:33.420
well, we, uh...

07:33.453 --> 07:34.555
No, I, uh... I...

07:34.822 --> 07:36.924
We have to drill
the lock and, uh...

07:36.957 --> 07:39.793
I get it. (STAMMERS)
Makes sense.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.762
What we should do
is order a new key.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.864

and that way, you know,

Just go ahead and
pack up all my accounts.

08:05.753 --> 08:08.822

have that much cash on hand.

there's no need to...

08:11.491 --> 08:12.660
No, it's fine. I understand.

You don't want to help me.

of national tragedy,

or need to know what's...

Although, ES,
may I suggest, um,

09:18.058 --> 09:20.527
well, it's just that
whenever you take out

09:20.560 --> 09:21.595
anything more than $10,000,

09:21.629 --> 09:22.630
it automatically triggers a...

Uh, maybe $1 million.

what is that, 10 grand?

11:08.168 --> 11:11.171
Now, see, that's the criminal

He did what?

11:25.919 --> 11:28.822
Oh, believe me,
I'm pretty ticked myself.

11:28.856 --> 11:29.857
I loved that dog.

11:30.791 --> 11:31.925
Plus the money, of course.

11:31.959 --> 11:35.228

I mean, used
feminine hygiene products

11:37.197 --> 11:38.999
in a man's desk drawer
is one thing,

11:39.032 --> 11:40.868
but now,

11:41.935 --> 11:44.938
the ridicule of
beloved remains.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.208
"Cremains" is the, I think,
preferred nomenclature.

11:48.241 --> 11:49.877
This is
the last thing we need.

anything past him.

we're getting pulled

sticky here, so...

12:54.207 --> 12:56.343
What the shit are they up to?

13:16.163 --> 13:19.900
YURI: When Putin was a boy,

13:21.134 --> 13:23.303
he already knew
he wanted to be FSB.

13:24.905 --> 13:27.107
He lived in the well,

13:27.140 --> 13:29.809
kept a photo of Bergin
by his bed.

13:31.311 --> 13:35.282
Bergin,
who squats in 1920 dirt,

13:35.315 --> 13:38.318
gives birth of GRU, later KGB.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.253
Godfather.

13:46.059 --> 13:50.263
And this boy, Putin,
he learns sambo,

13:51.264 --> 13:53.901
rules the yard school
by his fist.

13:55.002 --> 13:59.372
You see, in Russia,
there are two words for truth.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.046
Pravda  is man's truth.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.916
Istina  is God's truth.

14:08.949 --> 14:13.987
But there is also nepravda,
untruth.

14:14.021 --> 14:17.190
And this is the weapon
the leader uses.

14:19.292 --> 14:22.129
Because he knows
what they don't.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.967
The truth is
whatever he says it is.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.966
I don't get what's
so complicated here.

14:58.999 --> 15:03.203
You take a born loser,
add a drug addiction,

15:03.236 --> 15:05.372
remove a job,
fill his pockets with holes,

15:05.405 --> 15:07.007
mix in cold turkey,

15:07.907 --> 15:09.876
you think this guy
isn't gonna drive around

15:09.909 --> 15:11.378
randomly looking
for someone to rob?

15:11.411 --> 15:12.445
Yeah.

15:12.479 --> 15:15.148
But then why tear a page
out of the phonebook?

15:15.182 --> 15:17.117
Choose a house?
Doesn't that imply that...

15:17.150 --> 15:18.952
There you go.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.320
Using
three-syllable words again

15:20.353 --> 15:21.421
for a one-syllable problem.

15:22.355 --> 15:25.058
First, that's
a two-syllable word...

15:25.092 --> 15:27.894
Let me tell you
what I saw in Fallujah.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.129
Men, okay?

15:29.162 --> 15:32.432
My men laying in the dirt with
their guts in their boots.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.467
How does that...

15:34.501 --> 15:36.136
With all respect...

15:36.169 --> 15:37.337
You know what an IED is?

15:38.105 --> 15:40.240
It's like car parts
and dynamite.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.442
You either run one over,
or you don't.

15:42.475 --> 15:45.112
That's it, see? It's random.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.913
Or bombs in
our American streets.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.281
Who gets killed?

15:48.315 --> 15:50.250
Will you decide to walk
your dog that morning

15:50.283 --> 15:52.319
or mow the lawn?

15:52.952 --> 15:56.189
Your problem is
you're overcomplicating this.

15:57.124 --> 15:58.491
Books under the floorboards,

15:58.525 --> 16:01.294
an unapproved trip
to goddamn Hollywood.

16:01.328 --> 16:02.429
Told you.
I'm paying for that myself.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.930
Not the point.

you're or how you...

42:03.088 --> 42:06.592
But private matters
between me and my...

42:06.625 --> 42:08.526
I hear things.

42:09.961 --> 42:11.863
I hear them because I listen.

42:12.898 --> 42:14.700
I see them because I watch.

42:16.802 --> 42:18.570
Emails.

EMMIT: Who?

42:22.808 --> 42:23.875
SY: Well, now,
the fella from the...

42:23.909 --> 42:25.010

42:25.043 --> 42:26.712
SY: No. Different fella.

42:26.878 --> 42:29.047
Don't wanna say too much
on the phone.

42:29.080 --> 42:30.982
Just...
You better come down here.

42:35.086 --> 42:38.657
You can never be too careful.
That's my motto.

42:39.625 --> 42:43.561
You see, I've got
great plans for us, Emmit.

42:45.731 --> 42:47.065
Can't you just
take the money back?

42:47.098 --> 42:48.967
No. No, my friend, I'm sorry.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.969
You're in the pan,
and you know

42:51.002 --> 42:52.904
where you go
when you leave the pan.

42:53.104 --> 42:54.706
-The...
-The frying pan.

42:54.740 --> 42:56.675
You know where you go
when you leave.

42:58.009 --> 42:59.577
-Into the fire.
-Yeah.

I went to the Minnesota

43:14.826 --> 43:16.828
and they have
agreed to increase

43:16.862 --> 43:20.131
your line of credit
by $25 million.

43:22.668 --> 43:23.735
How?

43:23.769 --> 43:26.137
By acting as your agent,
your partner.

43:27.605 --> 43:31.677
So, (SIGHS) here's some of
the papers you need to sign.

43:32.043 --> 43:33.912
I've studied your books,

43:33.945 --> 43:35.681
and, uh, you're not just

43:35.714 --> 43:37.615
in the parking lot
business anymore.

43:38.116 --> 43:39.617
What business am I in?

43:39.851 --> 43:41.653
The billionaire business.

43:50.128 --> 43:52.130
But first you need
to tell me, uh,

43:53.732 --> 43:55.734
is your brother
going to be a problem?

43:56.868 --> 43:59.971
Ray? No, he...

44:00.739 --> 44:02.974
It's just a dumb rivalry.
(NERVOUS CHUCKLE)

44:10.181 --> 44:12.183

MALE NARRATOR: Just then
Grandfather came out.

44:37.776 --> 44:40.245
He was angry because Peter
had gone into the meadow.

44:42.680 --> 44:43.815
It's a dangerous place.

44:43.849 --> 44:45.650
If a wolf should
come out of the forest,

44:45.683 --> 44:46.852
then what would you do?

44:50.722 --> 44:53.892
(CLASSICAL MUSIC FROM
PETER AND THE WOLF  PLAYING)

45:15.280 --> 45:18.716
But Peter paid no attention
to his grandfather's words.

45:19.717 --> 45:21.953
Boys like Peter
aren't afraid of wolves.

45:22.287 --> 45:24.089
-Mom.
-Huh?

45:25.723 --> 45:27.225
I said it's time for bed.

45:28.093 --> 45:30.728
Well, go on and get
your teeth brushed.

46:34.792 --> 46:36.194
Little off the beaten path,
aren't you?

46:36.227 --> 46:38.930
I went by the station,
they said...

46:38.964 --> 46:40.265
Fudge, you were turning in.

46:40.298 --> 46:42.267
That's okay.
You want some tea?

46:42.300 --> 46:44.235
Yeah, sounds good.

46:47.038 --> 46:48.239
(WINNIE SIGHS)

46:49.975 --> 46:54.112
So remember I was telling you
about my hit-and-run?

46:54.145 --> 46:55.813
A Humvee in
a restaurant parking lot,

46:55.847 --> 46:57.782
-two other vehicles involved.
-Hmm.

46:57.815 --> 47:00.018
So I run the plate
number on the Hummer,

47:00.051 --> 47:01.853
and it's registered
to a corporation

47:01.887 --> 47:03.388
in Saint Cloud, a company car.

47:03.989 --> 47:05.924
Seems like you're
crossing all the T's.

47:06.157 --> 47:07.358
Not sure how it's...

47:07.392 --> 47:09.160
Well, okay, then.

47:09.194 --> 47:11.997
So, after I see you
in the commode,

47:12.030 --> 47:14.365
I go see this fellow
that works there,

47:14.399 --> 47:15.934
and something strikes me odd.

47:16.167 --> 47:17.302
The name.

47:17.335 --> 47:20.138
See, it turns out
that one of the victims

47:20.171 --> 47:21.406
has the same last name

47:22.073 --> 47:23.308
as the fellow
that owns the company

47:23.341 --> 47:24.375
that leased the car.

47:25.176 --> 47:27.979
So I looked it up,
and, get this,

47:28.013 --> 47:30.848
they're brothers, which...

47:31.349 --> 47:32.984
Then I remembered that

47:33.018 --> 47:34.185
you were at the Parole Board
about a murder,

47:34.219 --> 47:35.320
and so I looked it up.

47:35.353 --> 47:36.922
I mean,
Eden Valley's had one death

47:36.955 --> 47:38.189
by foul play in 16 months.

47:38.223 --> 47:40.158
And the victim's name is...

47:40.191 --> 47:41.392
Ennis Stussy.

47:42.928 --> 47:44.195
(STAMMERS)

47:47.933 --> 47:50.368

that leased the Humvee,

47:50.401 --> 47:54.072
and who lives, get this,
