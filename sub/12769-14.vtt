IT'S A LONG DRIVE OUT THERE,

00:52.208 --> 00:55.667
AND I DON'T HAVE A LOT
OF SPARE TIME THESE DAYS.

00:55.709 --> 00:58.667
IT'S HARD TO EVEN TAKE
THE HOUR TO COME HERE.

00:58.709 --> 01:02.041
I-I WOULD THINK SEEING BRETT
THIS WEEK WOULD BE A PRIORITY.

01:02.083 --> 01:04.041
THEN YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
MY PRIORITIES.

01:04.083 --> 01:06.166
HILARY, I SEEM TO BE
IRRITATING YOU TODAY.

01:06.208 --> 01:08.166
AM I IRRITATING YOU?

01:08.208 --> 01:11.291
WHAT'S YOUR POSITION
ON THE DEATH PENALTY?
(clears throat)

01:11.333 --> 01:13.458
WELL, I-I'D LIKE TO KEEP
THE FOCUS ON YOU--

01:13.500 --> 01:16.583
I KNOW. ALL YOU SHRINKS PREFER
TO KEEP THE FOCUS ON ME.

01:16.625 --> 01:18.041
I KNOW
THAT'S YOUR PREFERENCE.

01:18.083 --> 01:19.875
BUT I'D STILL LIKE YOU
TO TELL ME

01:19.917 --> 01:21.875
YOUR POSITION
ON THE DEATH PENALTY,

01:21.917 --> 01:23.875
BECAUSE IN 48 HOURS,
THE STATE PLANS

01:23.917 --> 01:26.291
TO HANG AN INNOCENT MAN
IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE.

01:26.333 --> 01:29.291
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO.
EVEN IF THEY'VE PLANNED TO DO IT

01:29.333 --> 01:31.959
WITH A TABLE AND A NEEDLE IN HIS
VEIN, IT'S NO LESS BARBARIC.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.041
AND YOU SEEM TO WANT ME TO
GIVE OVER TO THAT, TO GIVE UP,

01:35.083 --> 01:37.041
TO SPEND HOURS
CRYING IN MY HUSBAND'S LAP--

01:37.083 --> 01:40.041
HOURS THAT COULD BE SPENT
ON THE PHONE

01:40.083 --> 01:42.500
TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE
TRYING TO SAVE HIS LIFE.

01:45.750 --> 01:47.750
I HONESTLY DON'T EVEN
UNDERSTAND THAT.

01:47.792 --> 01:50.542
I JUST WANT YOU
TO GET SOME CLOSURE.

01:50.583 --> 01:52.500
YOU WANT ME TO GIVE UP.

01:52.542 --> 01:54.542
THAT'S NOT A THING
I'M EVER GONNA DO.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.458
I HAVEN'T HEARD
FROM MY WIFE THIS WEEK.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.959
(Sheldon) I UNDERSTAND
SHE'S FIGHTING HARD

02:01.000 --> 02:03.291
TO GET ANOTHER STAY.
(sighs)

02:03.333 --> 02:05.375
MY SON STOPPED BY TO SEE ME.
HOW WAS THAT?

02:05.417 --> 02:08.500
UM, HE WAS 9 MONTHS OLD
WHEN I WENT AWAY,

02:08.542 --> 02:11.500
AND NOW HE'S GOT FACIAL HAIR
AND AN ATTITUDE.

02:11.542 --> 02:13.500
HARD TO BE
ANY KIND OF DECENT FATHER

02:13.542 --> 02:16.166
FROM DEATH ROW.

02:16.208 --> 02:18.792
ARE YOU AFRAID THAT'S
THE LAST TIME YOU'LL SEE HIM?

02:18.834 --> 02:20.375
I'M NOT AFRAID.

02:20.417 --> 02:22.291
I'M NOT AFRAID TO DIE.

02:22.333 --> 02:25.041
IS THAT
WHAT YOU TOLD YOUR SON?

02:25.083 --> 02:28.041
I TOLD HIM... THAT HE SHOULD
GO TAKE A DRIVE.

02:28.083 --> 02:29.542
YOU KNOW, JUST...

02:29.583 --> 02:32.041
HE SHOULD GO TAKE A ROAD TRIP
WITH HIS FRIENDS.

02:32.083 --> 02:35.500
HIS MOTHER AND I...
DON'T WANT HIM HERE THIS WEEK

02:35.542 --> 02:36.959
FOR...

02:37.000 --> 02:39.500
HE BELIEVES HIS FATHER IS...

02:39.542 --> 02:41.417
BEING WRONGFULLY EXECUTED.

02:41.458 --> 02:44.125
HOW DOES A KID
FORGIVE THE WORLD AFTER THAT?

02:44.166 --> 02:46.125
HOW DOES HE MAKE ANYTHING
OF HIMSELF

02:46.166 --> 02:49.083
WHEN HE BELIEVES
THAT'S THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS?

02:49.125 --> 02:51.542
THAT'S AN INTERESTING CHOICE
OF WORDS. "HE BELIEVES."

02:51.583 --> 02:53.583
YOU'VE MAINTAINED
YOUR INNOCENCE FOR 17 YEARS.

02:53.625 --> 02:55.583
WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER
FOR SEVERAL MONTHS.

02:55.625 --> 02:57.417
YOU'VE NEVER SAID ANYTHING
LIKE...

03:00.333 --> 03:02.000
I'M GUILTY.

03:04.125 --> 03:07.166
I DID IT, DR. WALLACE.
I'M GUILTY AS SIN.

03:13.625 --> 03:15.625
YOUR WIFE DOESN'T KNOW.

03:15.667 --> 03:18.667
NO. MY WIFE, MY SON--
THEY BELIEVE ME.

03:18.709 --> 03:21.417
HE DOESN'T KNOW ME
EXCEPT IN PRISON,

03:21.458 --> 03:23.625
SO HE BELIEVES HIS MOTHER,
AND HILARY...

03:23.667 --> 03:27.458
SHE KNEW ME FOR A LONG TIME
BEFORE I WAS IN HERE.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.458
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER
SINCE HIGH SCHOOL.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.458
I WAS 27
WHEN THEY PUT ME AWAY.

03:31.500 --> 03:34.542
SHE'S NEVER HEARD ME
RAISE MY VOICE LET ALONE A GUN.

03:34.583 --> 03:36.542
I NEVER RAISED A HAND
TO ANYBODY.

03:36.583 --> 03:39.542
SO, UH... (sighs)
WHAT HAPPENED?

03:39.583 --> 03:42.041
I SNAPPED.

03:42.083 --> 03:44.291
THAT'S ABOUT ALL I CAN SAY
TO THAT.

03:44.333 --> 03:47.041
I MET A GUY IN A BAR

03:47.083 --> 03:49.917
WHO WAS RUDE, DISRESPECTFUL.

03:49.959 --> 03:51.917
FOLLOWED HIM HOME,
SAW WHERE HE LIVED,

03:51.959 --> 03:54.917
AND I WENT BLIND. YOU KNOW
THE PHRASE "SEEING RED"?

03:54.959 --> 03:57.208
IT'S LIKE
SOMETHING INSIDE ME BROKE.

03:59.291 --> 04:03.166
WE KEPT A GUN IN THE HOUSE
FOR PROTECTION.

04:03.208 --> 04:06.250
I WENT HOME, I GOT THE GUN,
I WENT BACK TO MR. MILLER'S,

04:06.291 --> 04:08.041
AND I SHOT HIM.

04:08.083 --> 04:11.875
AND NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS...

04:11.917 --> 04:13.709
WOULD HILARY EVER BELIEVE

04:13.750 --> 04:15.709
THAT I WOULD DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.750
I DON'T EVEN
BELIEVE IT MYSELF.

04:19.667 --> 04:22.125
DO YOU WANT TO TELL HER?

04:22.166 --> 04:25.041
DO YOU WANT HER TO KNOW?
NO, I DON'T WANT TO TELL HER.

04:25.083 --> 04:27.875
(exhales deeply)
BUT I DON'T WANT HER

04:27.917 --> 04:30.542
TO SPEND ANY MORE OF HER LIFE
HATING THE WORLD.

04:30.583 --> 04:33.041
AND I DON'T WANT THAT
FOR MY SON.

04:33.083 --> 04:36.667
IT'S BETTER THAT THEY HATE ME
THAN HATE THE WORLD.

04:36.709 --> 04:38.542
DON'T YOU THINK?

04:38.583 --> 04:40.792
(sighs)

04:42.083 --> 04:43.750
IT WAS CREEPY.

04:43.792 --> 04:45.125
SHE'S GRIEVING.

04:45.166 --> 04:47.166
NO, I-I GET GRIEVING.
I-I GET THAT.

04:47.208 --> 04:49.291
THIS--THIS I DON'T GET.
IT WAS CREEPY.

04:49.333 --> 04:51.959
WAS SHE LIKE,
"YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME,"

04:52.000 --> 04:54.333
OR WAS SHE LIKE, YOU KNOW,
"DON'T COME"?
SHE DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING REALLY.

04:54.375 --> 04:57.041
SHE DIDN'T EVEN LOOK AT ME.
IT WAS LIKE ADDISON

04:57.083 --> 05:01.041
WAS TAKEN OVER BY THE GHOST
OF HER COLD AND WASPY MOTHER.

05:01.083 --> 05:04.500
(mutters) IT WAS CREEPY.
WHY AREN'T YOU IN CONNECTICUT
WITH ADDISON?

05:04.542 --> 05:07.667
SHE TOLD ME
I DIDN'T HAVE TO COME.
OH. IN ALL THOSE YEARS
OF MARRIAGE,

05:07.709 --> 05:10.667
DID I REALLY
TEACH YOU NOTHING?
SO YOU'RE SAYING NOW
I SHOULD HAVE GONE ANYWAY?

05:10.709 --> 05:12.875
YES, YOU MORON.
YOU SHOULDA GONE.

05:12.917 --> 05:15.083
BUT YOU DIDN'T,
SO YOU SHOULD GO NOW.

05:15.125 --> 05:17.291
WE SHOULD ALL GO.

05:17.333 --> 05:19.709
W-WAIT, ALL--WHO ALL?
YEAH, YOU KNOW, CHARLOTTE'S
NOT GONNA WANT TO GO.

05:19.750 --> 05:22.375
GO WHERE?
CONNECTICUT
TO SUPPORT ADDISON.

05:22.417 --> 05:24.625
OH, WE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY GO.

05:24.667 --> 05:27.625
WHEN BIG DADDY DIED, YOU CAME.
IT MEANT EVERYTHING TO ME.

05:27.667 --> 05:30.291
WE SHOULD ALL GET ON A PLANE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

05:30.333 --> 05:32.291
HEY. HOW DID THINGS GO
WITH HILARY?

05:32.333 --> 05:35.166
AS WELL AS CAN BE EXPECTED.
I'M GONNA CHECK TICKETS
AND HOTEL ROOMS.

05:35.208 --> 05:37.417
(Charlotte) I FLY FIRST CLASS.
(Naomi) YEAH, ME--ME, TOO.

05:37.458 --> 05:40.291
WH--TICKETS?
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GOING
TO BE WITH ADDISON.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.291
OH. OH, GOD. I CAN'T GO.

05:42.333 --> 05:44.417
MY, UM, MY PATIENT'S HUSBAND
IS, UH,

05:44.458 --> 05:46.625
WELL, IF HE DOESN'T GET
A STAY,

05:46.667 --> 05:48.625
HE WILL BE EXECUTED
IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS,

05:48.667 --> 05:52.083
SO I NEED TO BE HERE.
I'M SORRY, YOU GUYS. YOU'RE
JUST GONNA HAVE TO SURVIVE

05:52.125 --> 05:54.458
WITHOUT US.
OH, NO. PETE, YOU SHOULD GO.

05:59.083 --> 06:02.000
OKAY, WHAT--
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

06:24.291 --> 06:26.458
(whirs)

06:31.250 --> 06:33.208
THE MAILBOX IS
IN A DIFFERENT ZIP CODE.

06:33.250 --> 06:35.792
THAT'S NOT NORMAL.
NOTHING ABOUT THESE PEOPLE
IS NORMAL.

06:35.834 --> 06:39.208
IT'S AMAZING ADDISON TURNED OUT
SO RELATIVELY SANE.

06:39.250 --> 06:42.875
(scoffs) YOU SAY THAT NOW.
WAIT.

06:49.500 --> 06:52.250
HELLO. THANK YOU FOR COMING.

06:52.291 --> 06:55.041
LOOK, WE, UH, WE DIDN'T MEAN
TO AMBUSH YOU OR ANYTHING.

06:55.083 --> 06:57.458
WE JUST WANTED TO BE HERE
FOR YOU.

06:57.500 --> 07:01.625
OF COURSE. HOW LOVELY.
WON'T YOU COME IN FOR A DRINK?

07:01.667 --> 07:04.750
(lowered voice) OH, YEAH.
TOTALLY CREEPY.

07:12.083 --> 07:14.542
A FEW OF BIZZY'S FRIENDS
STOPPED BY

07:14.583 --> 07:16.625
TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.959
WHICH MEANS GOSSIP
AND DRINK OUR BOOZE.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.625
HI. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL.
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

07:22.667 --> 07:24.291
OF COURSE.

07:24.333 --> 07:27.041
UH, IS VIOLET...
(Pete) UH, NOT HERE.

07:27.083 --> 07:30.333
SHE HAD AN EMERGENCY AT WORK.
SHAME.

07:30.375 --> 07:32.875
SENDS HER BEST.
WELL, IF IT ISN'T

07:32.917 --> 07:34.917
THE ENTIRE CAST
OF "THE TAN AND THE BEAUTIFUL."

07:34.959 --> 07:36.583
GOD, I MISS CALIFORNIA.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.500
HELLO, BEAUTIFUL.

07:40.542 --> 07:42.250
HELLO, ARCHER.

07:42.291 --> 07:44.041
(Captain)
THANKS FOR COMING.

07:44.083 --> 07:45.917
MY MOTHER DIED. BE NICE.

07:45.959 --> 07:47.917
GIVEN THAT
THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU,

07:47.959 --> 07:50.166
YOU CLIMBED OUT OF MY BED
AND DISAPPEARED--
BYGONES. DEAD MOTHER.

07:50.208 --> 07:52.500
MM-HMM.
COME ON. GIVE ME SOMETHING.

07:52.542 --> 07:55.291
I'M HERE, AREN'T I?
WE SHOULD, UH, PROBABLY
GET BACK TO THE HOTEL.

07:55.333 --> 07:58.291
OH, NO. WE HAVE
PLENTY OF ROOMS HERE.
NO, NO, ARCHER.
THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.

07:58.333 --> 08:00.959
NO, I'M GRIEVING. IT'S DECIDED.
YOU'RE ALL STAYING.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.375
(Addison) I DON'T MEAN TO BE
RUDE, BUT WE HAVE TO SIT DOWN

08:03.417 --> 08:05.750
FOR A MEETING
WITH THE FUNERAL DIRECTOR.
AHH.

08:05.792 --> 08:09.125
GO AHEAD. WE--WE CAN--
WE CAN TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES.
YOU'LL HAVE TO POUR
YOUR OWN DRINKS.

08:09.166 --> 08:11.959
THE HOUSE HAS BEEN CLOSED
SINCE BIZZY LEFT.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.041
(tony accent)
POUR OUR OWN DRINKS? SHAME.

08:15.083 --> 08:16.959
(whispers) HEY.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.458
(normal voice) HEY.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.750
I KNOW
YOU DIDN'T WANT ME TO COME,

08:23.792 --> 08:25.542
BUT I'M HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

08:25.583 --> 08:27.375
THANK YOU.

08:31.583 --> 08:33.583
HE DID IT?
I WAS HIS THERAPIST
FOR FOUR MONTHS.

08:33.625 --> 08:35.083
I BELIEVED HE WAS INNOCENT.

08:35.125 --> 08:37.083
HOW DO YOU THINK
IT MAKES ME FEEL ABOUT ME?

08:37.125 --> 08:38.709
SO I-I HAVE A PATIENT

08:38.750 --> 08:41.041
WHO HAS SPENT
THE LAST 17 YEARS OF HER LIFE,

08:41.083 --> 08:43.125
FULL-TIME, FIGHTING
FOR HER HUSBAND'S FREEDOM.

08:43.166 --> 08:45.125
YOU SHOULD HEAR HER
GO ON ABOUT THIS CASE.

08:45.166 --> 08:47.667
SHE CAN TELL YOU THE EXACT
NUMBER OF WHITE PICKUP TRUCKS

08:47.709 --> 08:49.333
REGISTERED IN CALIFORNIA
IN '94.

08:49.375 --> 08:52.125
SHE CAN TELL YOU THE EXACT
NUMBER OF 38-CALIBER HANDGUNS.

08:52.166 --> 08:54.125
SHE CAN TELL YOU THE NAME
AND CELL PHONE NUMBER

08:54.166 --> 08:56.583
OF EVERY GUBERNATORIAL AIDE
WHO'S WORKED IN THIS STATE

08:56.625 --> 08:59.166
FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS.
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND,
BELIEVE ME.

08:59.208 --> 09:02.041
IT ISN'T RIGHT. I MEAN, IF HE
WANTS TO CLEAR HIS CONSCIENCE

09:02.083 --> 09:04.875
AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR, THEN LET
HIM TALK TO YOU, NOT TO HER.

09:04.917 --> 09:07.000
HE DOESN'T GET
TO UNBURDEN HIMSELF

09:07.041 --> 09:09.750
AT THE EXPENSE OF HER SANITY.
AND YOU DON'T THINK
SHE DESERVES TO KNOW THE TRUTH?

09:09.792 --> 09:12.750
I THINK SHE DESERVES
A LITTLE PEACE.
AND YOU THINK SHE'S GONNA
GET THAT, WHEN HER HUSBAND,

09:12.792 --> 09:15.250
AN INNOCENT MAN, DIES
AT THE HANDS OF THE STATE?

09:15.291 --> 09:18.041
MY CLIENT ASKED ME TO TALK
TO YOU AND THEN TO HIS WIFE

09:18.083 --> 09:20.041
ON HIS BEHALF.
HE'S A DYING MAN,

09:20.083 --> 09:22.917
AND I FIND MYSELF INCLINED
TO HONOR HIS REQUEST.

09:22.959 --> 09:24.917
HE IS A DYING MURDERER
WHO'S BEEN LYING

09:24.959 --> 09:27.166
TO THOSE WHO LOVE HIM
FOR NEARLY 20 YEARS.
WELL, BE THAT AS IT MAY--

09:27.208 --> 09:29.083
ALL RIGHT. LET ME SPEND
SOME TIME WITH HER.

09:29.125 --> 09:31.083
LET ME SPEND SOME TIME
ON HER TURF, AND, UH,

09:31.125 --> 09:34.083
AND I WILL GET BACK TO YOU WITH
MY PROFESSIONAL RECOMMENDATION.

09:34.125 --> 09:38.041
LET'S KEEP THE EMPHASIS
ON "PROFESSIONAL."
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S COMMENTS LIKE THAT--

09:38.083 --> 09:40.417
THAT'S WHY
YOU HAVE TROUBLE WITH WOMEN.

09:42.250 --> 09:45.000
IN LIEU OF FLOWERS,
MRS. MONTGOMERY STATED

09:45.041 --> 09:47.542
THAT DONATIONS
COULD BE MADE IN HER NAME

09:47.583 --> 09:49.959
TO THE CITY BALLET
OR THE GARDEN CLUB.
(Archer groans) I'M BORED.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.041
IS THERE A REASON
I HAVE TO BE HERE FOR THIS?
YES, THE REASON BEING

09:53.083 --> 09:57.041
THAT OUR MOTHER IS DEAD AND YOU
ARE A PART OF THIS FAMILY.

09:57.083 --> 09:58.959
I'VE SPOKEN
TO A LOT OF HER FRIENDS,

09:59.000 --> 10:00.667
BUT I MAY HAVE MISSED SOME.

10:00.709 --> 10:02.667
I'M NOT SURE
WHERE BIZZY'S ADDRESS BOOK IS.

10:02.709 --> 10:04.667
NOT TO WORRY. MRS. MONTGOMERY
MET WITH ME EVERY YEAR

10:04.709 --> 10:06.542
TO UPDATE
THE CONTACT INFORMATION

10:06.583 --> 10:09.083
OF THE PEOPLE
SHE WANTED TO INVITE.
GOD FORBID
THE WRONG SORT SHOW UP.

10:09.125 --> 10:12.041
WELL, TO BE CLEAR, SHE WANTED
A PUBLIC MEMORIAL SERVICE

10:12.083 --> 10:14.041
WITH A RECEPTION TO FOLLOW
AT THE HOUSE.

10:14.083 --> 10:17.041
THE INTERMENT IS JUST FOR
FAMILY AND CLOSE FRIENDS

10:17.083 --> 10:19.041
THE FOLLOWING MORNING.

10:19.083 --> 10:21.542
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE
BIZZY THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING.

10:21.583 --> 10:24.083
ONE LAST THING.
MRS. MONTGOMERY REQUESTED

10:24.125 --> 10:27.125
THAT THERE BE ONE EULOGY.

10:27.166 --> 10:29.458
I'D BE HAPPY TO DO IT.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.750
ACTUALLY, SIR. SHE ASKED
THAT ADDISON DO IT.

10:31.792 --> 10:34.000
HA.

10:37.792 --> 10:39.750
WHY AREN'T WE STAYING
AT A HOTEL AGAIN?

10:39.792 --> 10:41.750
THEY'VE ASKED US NOT TO.
WE'RE BEING POLITE.

10:41.792 --> 10:44.041
HOTELS HAVE ROOM SERVICE.
I VOTE FOR THE HOTEL.

10:44.083 --> 10:45.542
HOTELS ALSO HAVE HEAT
AND BLANKETS

10:45.583 --> 10:48.041
AND EMOTIONAL WARMTH.
HOTELS HAVE EMOTIONAL WARMTH?

10:48.083 --> 10:50.750
OR AT LEAST THE POSSIBILITY
OF IT.
THANK YOU.

10:50.792 --> 10:54.583
(Captain)
ARE YOU PEOPLE STILL HERE?
OH, THEY'RE STAYING, CAPTAIN.

10:54.625 --> 10:57.375
ACTUALLY, SIR--
OUR MOTHER DIED.
YOU'RE STAYING.

10:57.417 --> 11:00.792
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
SOMEONE CAN REFILL MY DRINK.

11:00.834 --> 11:03.750
IF YOU ALL WILL EXCUSE ME,
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.

11:03.792 --> 11:05.125
I'M GONNA GO LAY DOWN.

11:05.166 --> 11:07.041
I HAVE A QUESTION FIRST.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.583
YOU'RE ALL DOCTORS
IN THIS ROOM, RIGHT?

11:08.625 --> 11:11.125
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU.

11:11.166 --> 11:15.542
SO HOW DOES AN ARMY OF DOCTORS
LET MY WIFE DIE

11:15.583 --> 11:18.417
WITHOUT EVEN
A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED FIGHT?

11:18.458 --> 11:21.041
I MEAN, HOW MANY HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

11:21.083 --> 11:23.834
DID YOUR PARENTS WASTE
ON MEDICAL SCHOOL

11:23.875 --> 11:26.709
SO YOU COULD LET A RELATIVELY
YOUNG AND HEALTHY WOMAN

11:26.750 --> 11:29.083
JUST DIE ON YOUR WATCH?

11:29.125 --> 11:30.875
IT WAS A HEART ATTACK,
CAPTAIN.

11:30.917 --> 11:33.375
IT HAPPENED FAST, AND WE
WEREN'T THERE. I TOLD YOU THAT.

11:33.417 --> 11:35.041
I THOUGHT IT WAS
AN ANEURYSM.

11:35.083 --> 11:37.041
WHAT?

11:37.083 --> 11:39.959
UH, YOU SAID SHE DIED
OF AN ANEURYSM.
RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.333
WELL, JUST NOW
YOU SAID HEART ATTACK.

11:42.375 --> 11:45.542
IT'S AN ANEURYSM.
I'M JUST TIRED.
(Archer) SHE'S GRIEVING, SAM.

11:45.583 --> 11:47.250
YOU'RE GONNA SPLIT HAIRS?

11:47.291 --> 11:50.041
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'M GONNA GO LAY DOWN.
(Naomi) ADDIE.

11:50.083 --> 11:53.125
IF YOU NEED SOMEONE
TO TALK TO--
THANK YOU.
I JUST NEED TO REST.

11:53.166 --> 11:56.750
(footsteps retreating)

12:04.291 --> 12:08.000
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU WERE OKAY.

12:08.041 --> 12:11.458
I'M TOO BUSY TO BE SURE.
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:11.500 --> 12:14.417
TRYING TO GET AN ONLINE PETITION
FINALIZED, AND I--

12:14.458 --> 12:17.041
DO YOU HAVE ANY CONTACTS
IN THE PRESS?

12:17.083 --> 12:20.041
HILARY, I KNOW WE'VE ONLY BEEN
WORKING TOGETHER A FEW MONTHS,

12:20.083 --> 12:22.917
AND, UH, AND--AND WE DIDN'T
GET A LOT DONE EARLIER,

12:22.959 --> 12:25.291
BUT I--
DR. TURNER, WITH RESPECT,
IN THE LAST 17 YEARS,

12:25.333 --> 12:27.041
I'VE FILED
NINE SEPARATE APPEALS,

12:27.083 --> 12:28.709
I'VE PETITIONED SIX COURTS,

12:28.750 --> 12:31.875
I'VE WRITTEN 368 LETTERS TO
THE STATE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT,

12:31.917 --> 12:34.959
I'VE LOST TWO HOUSES,
HAD THREE NERVOUS BREAKDOWNS,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.959
AND I HAVEN'T SLEPT THROUGH
THE NIGHT IN ALMOST TWO DECADES.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.917
AND IT ALL COMES DOWN
TO THIS WEEK.

12:39.959 --> 12:43.875
SO PLEASE, I'M BUSY.

12:43.917 --> 12:46.458
WHAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK?

12:46.500 --> 12:49.291
WHAT IF YOU CAN'T GET
BRETT'S EXECUTION STAYED?

12:49.333 --> 12:51.458
I TOLD YOU,
I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT THAT.

12:51.500 --> 12:54.208
HILARY--
(voice breaks) I SAID NO.

12:54.250 --> 12:57.041
(normal voice) LOOK, SPARE ME
"THE WORLD ISN'T FAIR" SPEECH.

12:57.083 --> 12:58.750
CAR ACCIDENTS, SICK KIDS--

12:58.792 --> 13:00.834
I KNOW BAD THINGS HAPPEN
TO GOOD PEOPLE.

13:00.875 --> 13:03.208
BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH BRETT,
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.709
IT'S PREVENTABLE, AND IF I
DON'T DO EVERYTHING I CAN

13:05.750 --> 13:08.458
TO TRY TO STOP IT--
AND YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN?

13:08.500 --> 13:11.041
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
AND ALL THIS WORK, YOU...

13:11.083 --> 13:13.875
I'M--I'M WORRIED ABOUT
WHAT IS GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU

13:13.917 --> 13:15.875
IF THIS DOESN'T GO YOUR WAY.

13:15.917 --> 13:18.041
WHEN EVERYTHING YOU'VE
SURROUNDED YOURSELF WITH HERE

13:18.083 --> 13:20.000
IS--IS MOOT, WHAT THEN?

13:20.041 --> 13:22.000
IT'LL NEVER BE MOOT.

13:22.041 --> 13:25.041
I WON'T LET GO.
I WON'T STOP.

13:25.083 --> 13:27.875
WHETHER BRETT'S HERE OR NOT,
I WILL CLEAR HIS NAME.

13:27.917 --> 13:31.000
FOR OUR SON'S SAKE,
FOR MY SAKE...

13:33.583 --> 13:36.041
I WON'T STOP.

13:36.083 --> 13:39.333
(keyboard keys click)

13:46.083 --> 13:50.041
OH, I, UH, I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE SLEEPING.

13:50.083 --> 13:52.083
SUSAN'S IN THERE.

13:52.125 --> 13:54.500
WHAT?

13:54.542 --> 13:56.041
IN THE URN.

13:56.083 --> 13:58.583
I HAD HER CREMATED
AT HER REQUEST,

13:58.625 --> 14:00.667
AND THEY DELIVERED
THE URN TODAY.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.417
IT'S PRETTY,
DON'T YOU THINK?

14:02.458 --> 14:05.083
UH, OKAY.
(clears throat)

14:05.125 --> 14:07.417
CREMATION
IS SUCH A STRANGE THING.

14:07.458 --> 14:10.083
ADDISON--
I DON'T THINK I'D WANT
TO BE CREMATED,

14:10.125 --> 14:12.083
EXCEPT FOR THE POETRY OF IT,

14:12.125 --> 14:14.041
THE BIBLICAL ALLUSION.

14:14.083 --> 14:17.417
ASHES TO ASHES,
DUST TO DUST.

14:17.458 --> 14:19.041
THAT'S NICE.

14:21.458 --> 14:23.417
LOOK, BABY,
WHY DON'T YOU LIE DOWN?

14:23.458 --> 14:26.041
ALL RIGHT? LET ME HOLD YOU
WHILE YOU SLEEP.

14:26.083 --> 14:28.041
I DON'T WANT TO BE CREMATED.

14:28.083 --> 14:30.041
MAYBE I'LL DONATE MY BODY
TO SCIENCE.

14:30.083 --> 14:31.625
REMEMBER...

14:31.667 --> 14:34.417
OUR CADAVER
IN MEDICAL SCHOOL?

14:34.458 --> 14:36.625
UH, YEAH.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.041
YEAH.
WHAT DID WE CALL HIM?

14:39.083 --> 14:41.041
WE CALLED HIM MR. MULLIGAN.

14:41.083 --> 14:42.875
(whispers)
MULLIGAN. MULLIGAN.

14:42.917 --> 14:45.375
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY.
IT WAS DEREK'S IDEA.

14:45.417 --> 14:52.041
ACTUALLY, HE NAMED IT AFTER
HIS FAVORITE MATH TEACHER.

14:52.083 --> 14:54.500
MR. MULLIGAN.

14:54.542 --> 14:56.041
REMEMBER...

14:56.083 --> 14:58.625
WHAT WE DID WITH HIM
WHEN WE WERE DONE?

14:58.667 --> 15:01.041
WE GAVE HIM
A MEMORIAL SERVICE.

15:01.083 --> 15:03.875
WE THANKED HIM
FOR HIS SACRIFICE

15:03.917 --> 15:06.417
AND HIS CONTRIBUTION
TO OUR EDUCATION.

15:06.458 --> 15:09.458
GOD. WE WERE EARNEST.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.041
WE LIT CANDLES.

15:11.083 --> 15:14.291
THAT WAS NICE.

15:14.333 --> 15:16.417
THAT'S NICE.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.417
I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.

15:18.458 --> 15:20.625
DONATE MY BODY TO SCIENCE.

15:23.083 --> 15:25.667
WHERE YOU GOING?

15:25.709 --> 15:28.750
I DON'T THINK I CAN SLEEP
WITH SUSAN IN THE ROOM.

15:33.291 --> 15:35.542
(sighs)

15:35.583 --> 15:37.041
I DON'T CARE.

15:37.083 --> 15:39.083
ARCHER, I-I KNOW THAT
THE RELATIONSHIPS

15:39.125 --> 15:43.041
IN--IN YOUR FAMILY
ARE--ARE COMPLICATED, BUT--

15:43.083 --> 15:45.041
OH, WE'RE LIKE
A BAD RUSSIAN NOVEL.

15:45.083 --> 15:48.041
YEAH, BUT STILL,
BIZZY WAS YOUR MOTHER.

15:48.083 --> 15:50.417
YOU SHOULD CARE.

15:50.458 --> 15:52.041
SAM'S YOUR EX-HUSBAND,

15:52.083 --> 15:55.291
AND ADDISON IS PROBABLY UP THERE
RIGHT NOW, SCREWING HIM.
SHH.

15:55.333 --> 15:56.917
DO YOU CARE?

15:56.959 --> 15:59.000
SAM AND I WERE OVER
A LONG TIME AGO.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.041
SO WERE
THE CAPTAIN AND BIZZY.

16:01.083 --> 16:03.875
DOESN'T STOP HIM FROM SIMMERING
WITH JEALOUS RAGE.

16:03.917 --> 16:05.291
YES.

16:05.333 --> 16:07.166
YES, IT...

16:07.208 --> 16:09.792
YES, OF COURSE IT--
IT BOTHERS ME.

16:09.834 --> 16:11.166
I CARE.

16:11.208 --> 16:14.041
BUT THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS
IN LIFE THAT BOTHER ME.

16:14.083 --> 16:16.041
YOU KNOW,
ABORTION BOTHERS ME,

16:16.083 --> 16:18.041
AND--AND OVERPOPULATION
BOTHERS ME,

16:18.083 --> 16:20.041
AND THOSE THINGS ARE
AT SUCH HORRIFYING ODDS,

16:20.083 --> 16:21.667
THAT I CAN'T EVEN--

16:21.709 --> 16:24.333
I CAN'T EVEN WRAP MY HEAD
AROUND IT, YOU KNOW?

16:24.375 --> 16:26.333
I CAN'T WRAP MY HEAD AROUND
ANYTHING, YOU KNOW?

16:26.375 --> 16:28.834
I MEAN--
YOU KNOW I'M A GRANDMOTHER?

16:28.875 --> 16:30.834
I'M A GRANDMOTHER,
FOR GOD SAKE.

16:30.875 --> 16:32.834
AND THAT,
THAT SERIOUSLY BOTHERS ME.

16:32.875 --> 16:34.792
BUT I CAN'T CONTROL ANYTHING.

16:34.834 --> 16:37.417
I JUST, UH...
CAN'T CONTROL ANYTHING.

16:37.458 --> 16:40.041
CERTAINLY NOT
ANYONE ELSE'S FEELINGS.

16:40.083 --> 16:41.834
YOU KNOW...

16:41.875 --> 16:45.041
SAM AND ADDISON
ARE BEYOND MY CONTROL.

16:45.083 --> 16:48.041
AND, YES, IT DOES BOTHER ME.

16:48.083 --> 16:51.125
BUT, UH... I CHOOSE
NOT TO BE ANGRY

16:51.166 --> 16:54.333
AND, UH...
NOT TO BE BITTER.

16:54.375 --> 16:58.625
AND JUST, UH, YOU KNOW,
LIVE IN THE MOMENT.

16:58.667 --> 16:59.834
OKAY.

16:59.875 --> 17:01.458
LET'S.

17:01.500 --> 17:04.000
OH, NO. THIS--ARCHER,
THAT IS--

17:04.041 --> 17:06.041
THAT IS NOT WHAT I MEANT.

17:06.083 --> 17:07.500
I DON'T CARE.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.041
SORRY. I WAS JUST, UH...

17:23.083 --> 17:27.458
COOPER NEEDS A LITTLE SOMETHING
TO HELP HIM SLEEP.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.375
SO DO I.

17:29.417 --> 17:32.083
(bottles clank)

17:35.083 --> 17:38.375
YOU SHOULDN'T DRINK ALONE.

17:38.417 --> 17:40.875
(pops can tab)

17:40.917 --> 17:42.792
TO BIZZY.

17:42.834 --> 17:45.291
RIGHT. TO BIZZY.

17:45.333 --> 17:47.500
HOW ARE YOU WITH WORDS?
SORRY?

17:47.542 --> 17:49.625
I HAVE TO WRITE A EULOGY
BY TOMORROW,

17:49.667 --> 17:51.625
AND I COULD USE A LITTLE HELP.

17:51.667 --> 17:54.041
ARE YOU A GOOD WRITER?

17:54.083 --> 17:55.875
NO, NOT REALLY.

17:57.834 --> 18:00.500
PLUS, I DIDN'T REALLY
KNOW BIZZY.

18:00.542 --> 18:03.041
(chuckles) NO ONE DID.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.041
WELL, MAYBE DON'T WRITE IT.

18:05.083 --> 18:07.041
MAYBE JUST, UH,

18:07.083 --> 18:09.208
GET UP THERE
AND SPEAK FROM THE HEART.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.125
(laughs)

18:11.166 --> 18:14.291
SORRY. SHE DID THIS
TO ME, YOU KNOW?

18:14.333 --> 18:17.417
THIS IS HER FINAL INSULT,
HER FINAL CRUELTY,

18:17.458 --> 18:19.208
TO PICK ME...

18:19.250 --> 18:22.417
TO STAND UP
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE AND LIE.

18:22.458 --> 18:25.291
YOU REALLY THINK
YOU HAVE TO LIE?

18:25.333 --> 18:28.041
BELIEVE ME. NOBODY WANTS
TO HEAR THE TRUTH.

18:28.083 --> 18:30.291
YOU MEAN THAT YOUR MOTHER
KILLED HERSELF?

18:32.083 --> 18:34.041
I'M
THE HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR.

18:34.083 --> 18:36.250
I SAW THE DEATH CERTIFICATE.

18:37.917 --> 18:41.041
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
I'M REALLY SORRY.

18:41.083 --> 18:44.709
I CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW IT MUST FEEL.

18:46.166 --> 18:49.125
SO IF YOU WANT TO TALK,

18:49.166 --> 18:51.041
I'M YOUR GAL.

18:51.083 --> 18:54.250
AND EVEN IF YOU DON'T,
MY LIPS ARE SEALED.

18:54.291 --> 18:57.291
EITHER WAY,
TOMORROW IN THAT CHAPEL,

18:57.333 --> 18:59.250
YOU STAND UP,

18:59.291 --> 19:02.250
SAY WHATEVER THE HELL
YOU WANT.

19:02.291 --> 19:04.291
FUNERALS AREN'T FOR THE DEAD.

19:04.333 --> 19:06.291
THEY'RE FOR THE LIVING.

19:06.333 --> 19:08.291
THEY'RE TO HELP US SURVIVE

19:08.333 --> 19:11.041
WHEN IT FEELS LIKE THE GRIEF
MIGHT JUST KILL US.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.750
TOMORROW'S FOR YOU, ADDISON.

19:12.792 --> 19:15.041
YOU HEAR ME?

19:15.083 --> 19:19.000
SAY WHATEVER THE HELL
YOU WANT.

19:29.083 --> 19:31.041
(Brett) YOU'D THINK
AFTER ALL THIS TIME,

19:31.083 --> 19:33.500
I WOULD KNOW WHAT TO SAY,
RIGHT?

19:33.542 --> 19:36.000
TAKE YOUR TIME.
THE WORDS WILL COME.

19:41.208 --> 19:45.333
OKAY,
YOU'RE FREAKING ME OUT.

19:45.375 --> 19:47.041
SPIT IT OUT.

19:47.083 --> 19:50.458
WHATEVER IT IS, AS LONG
AS YOU'RE NOT ASKING ME TO QUIT,

19:50.500 --> 19:52.959
I CAN HANDLE IT.
I DID IT.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.417
YOU DID WHAT?

19:54.458 --> 19:56.041
I MURDERED PAUL MILLER.

19:56.083 --> 19:58.000
IT WAS ME. I DID IT.

20:06.500 --> 20:11.000
(laughing)

20:13.917 --> 20:16.250
LAUGHTER RELIEVES TENSION.

20:16.291 --> 20:19.208
(continues laughing)
PEOPLE LAUGH AT FUNERALS
ALL THE TIME, YOU KNOW?

20:19.250 --> 20:21.250
IT--IT'S--IT'S OKAY.

20:21.291 --> 20:23.875
I NEVER--I NEVER--
I NEVER WANTED YOU TO KNOW.

20:23.917 --> 20:26.041
I-I ALWAYS WANTED YOU...
(laughs)

20:26.083 --> 20:27.458
TO BELIEVE IN ME.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.458
I DON'T KNOW
HOW I DID THAT THING.

20:29.500 --> 20:32.834
I STILL TO THIS DAY DON'T KNOW
HOW I DID IT. I AM SO SORRY.

20:32.875 --> 20:35.041
I AM SO SORRY.

20:35.083 --> 20:37.417
HILARY, I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT THIS FEELS LIKE.

20:37.458 --> 20:39.834
BUT BRETT DID WANT YOU
TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

20:39.875 --> 20:42.417
THAT'S--
THAT'S WORTH SOMETHING.

20:45.875 --> 20:50.041
(voice breaking) NO. NO, NO.
PLEASE, DON'T, DON'T, DON'T.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.375
DON'T GO. DON'T GO.

20:52.417 --> 20:55.291
BABY, BABY, PLEASE--
STEP BACK AND PUT YOUR HANDS
ON THE TABLE.

20:55.333 --> 20:58.041
PLEASE DON'T GO.
STEP BACK NOW.

20:58.083 --> 20:59.917
BABY, BABY.

20:59.959 --> 21:02.041
SHE NEEDS TIME TO PROCESS.

21:02.083 --> 21:03.458
(normal voice)
I DON'T HAVE ANY TIME LEFT.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.458
ARCHER, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO OVERSLEEP

21:09.500 --> 21:11.542
AND MISS BIZZY'S FUNERAL.

21:11.583 --> 21:13.834
MM.

21:13.875 --> 21:16.083
MM.

21:16.125 --> 21:17.917
WHAT?
WE'RE BOTH ADULTS.

21:17.959 --> 21:20.959
SOME CLOTHES WOULD BE NICE,
PREFERABLY SOMETHING BLACK.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.291
(knock on door)

21:22.333 --> 21:24.458
HILARY, ARE YOU THERE?

21:24.500 --> 21:28.041
THE DOOR WAS UNLOCKED,
SO I--WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:28.083 --> 21:30.667
THE GOVERNOR USUALLY
HAS DINNER AROUND 5:30,

21:30.709 --> 21:32.250
BUT HIS ASSISTANT
THOUGHT MAYBE

21:32.291 --> 21:34.959
IF I TRIED HIS
OLD OFFICE NUMBER--
HILARY, YOU HAVE TO STOP.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.041
I HAVE TO FIND
MY ADDRESS BOOK.

21:37.083 --> 21:40.041
I JUST HAD IT HERE,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE--
LOOK AT ME. LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT ME.

21:40.083 --> 21:43.041
DO YOU REMEMBER
SEEING BRETT THIS MORNING?
DO YOU THINK
I COULD FORGET THAT?

21:43.083 --> 21:46.083
DO YOU THINK I COULD EVER
FORGET THAT?
WELL, HE'S--
HE'S READY TO GO, HILARY.

21:46.125 --> 21:48.250
(telephone beeps)
HE'S MADE HIS PEACE.

21:48.291 --> 21:50.041
D-DOESN'T THAT MEAN ANYTHING,

21:50.083 --> 21:52.125
TH-THAT HE'S ACCEPTED HIS FATE,
THAT AT--

21:52.166 --> 21:55.083
THAT AT THE VERY LEAST,
IT WASN'T A WRONGFUL EXECUTION?

21:55.125 --> 21:58.041
DO YOU THINK
THERE'S ANY SUCH THING

21:58.083 --> 22:00.458
AS A RIGHTFUL EXECUTION,
DR. TURNER?
THAT IS NOT--

22:00.500 --> 22:02.417
JUSTIN WAS A COLICKY BABY.
(exhales)

22:02.458 --> 22:04.417
IT STARTED WHEN HE WAS ABOUT
A MONTH OLD

22:04.458 --> 22:06.417
AND IT DIDN'T STOP
FOR A YEAR.

22:06.458 --> 22:09.291
WE NEVER SLEPT. IT FELT LIKE
WE WERE GOING CRAZY.

22:09.333 --> 22:13.041
AND THEN BRETT GOT FIRED
WHEN WE WERE ALREADY BROKE.

22:13.083 --> 22:16.041
AND THEN HIS MOTHER,
WHO WAS OUR ONLY HELP,

22:16.083 --> 22:19.500
DROPPED DEAD IN THE STREET.

22:19.542 --> 22:22.834
SO BRETT WENT TO A BAR,
AND HE HAD TOO MANY DRINKS.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.834
HE HAD TOO MANY DRINKS

22:24.875 --> 22:27.125
AND HE HAD
SO MUCH RAGE INSIDE HIM,

22:27.166 --> 22:29.959
THAT...

22:30.000 --> 22:32.959
BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL
THE GOOD THINGS THAT HE DID?

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
THERE WERE
SO MANY GOOD THINGS.

22:35.041 --> 22:36.542
DOESN'T THAT COUNT
FOR ANYTHING?

22:36.583 --> 22:38.542
A LIFETIME OF KINDNESS,
DOESN'T THAT COUNT?

22:38.583 --> 22:40.041
DOESN'T THAT...
HILARY--

22:40.083 --> 22:42.542
MAKE UP FOR ONE MISTAKE?
LET'S TALK ABOUT
YOUR FEELINGS.

22:42.583 --> 22:45.125
YOU HAD A LOT OF FEELINGS
COME UP THIS MORNING

22:45.166 --> 22:48.125
WHEN BRETT TOLD YOU THE TRUTH.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THEM.
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO TALK ABOUT MY FEELINGS

22:48.166 --> 22:50.500
BECAUSE MY HUSBAND
IS ABOUT TO BE MURDERED!

22:53.000 --> 22:57.041
(sighs) THERE IT IS.

22:57.083 --> 22:59.125
LISTEN, I...

22:59.166 --> 23:01.583
I NEED TO GO SOMEWHERE.

23:01.625 --> 23:03.375
WILL YOU COME WITH ME?

23:03.417 --> 23:06.750
YES. YES, OF COURSE.

23:06.792 --> 23:11.375
DEAR LORD, TAKE BACK THE SOUL
OF BEATRICE FORBES MONTGOMERY.

23:11.417 --> 23:13.375
AMEN.

23:13.417 --> 23:15.000
(congregation) AMEN.

23:15.041 --> 23:18.041
(organ music playing)

23:19.667 --> 23:23.166
AND NOW
BIZZY'S DAUGHTER, ADDISON,

23:23.208 --> 23:25.875
WILL SAY A FEW WORDS.

23:35.083 --> 23:37.250
(lowered voice) ADDISON.

23:38.875 --> 23:41.834
UH...

23:41.875 --> 23:44.083
(clears throat)

23:50.083 --> 23:52.000
(paper rustles)

23:53.917 --> 23:58.041
MY MOTHER TOLD US THAT
WE SHOULD NEVER CRY IN PUBLIC.

23:58.083 --> 24:00.500
THE FORBSES DIDN'T DO THAT.

24:00.542 --> 24:02.417
IF WE NEEDED TO SHED TEARS

24:02.458 --> 24:05.417
IT SHOULD BE IN THE PRIVACY
OF ONE'S OWN HOME.

24:05.458 --> 24:08.291
EVEN BETTER, IN THE PRIVACY
OF OUR OWN ROOM.

24:08.333 --> 24:11.667
I'M GOING TO DO MY BEST
TO HONOR THAT TODAY.

24:11.709 --> 24:13.667
IN HER 62 YEARS,

24:13.709 --> 24:17.041
BIZZY TAUGHT ME AND MY BROTHER
A LOT OF THINGS.

24:17.083 --> 24:19.041
FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER,

24:19.083 --> 24:22.125
SHE ALWAYS TOLD US
NEVER TO SETTLE FOR SECOND BEST.

24:22.166 --> 24:24.792
IT WASN'T ENOUGH
TO BE GOOD AT SOMETHING.

24:24.834 --> 24:28.542
WE HAD TO BE STANDOUTS
AT WHATEVER WE DID.

24:28.583 --> 24:30.375
BIZZY DIDN'T BELIEVE

24:30.417 --> 24:32.375
THAT EVERY CAMPER
SHOULD GET A FEATHER.

24:32.417 --> 24:35.000
MY MOTHER THREW HERSELF
INTO EVERYTHING.

24:35.041 --> 24:38.000
SHE DID MORE VOLUNTEER WORK
THAN ANYONE I KNOW.

24:38.041 --> 24:41.959
SHE WAS ALSO A LEADING MEMBER
OF GREENWICH SOCIETY.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.917
SHE WAS PRESIDENT
OF THE JUNIOR LEAGUE

24:43.959 --> 24:45.959
FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.333
SHE ALSO RAN

24:47.375 --> 24:50.208
THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
BOOK SALE EVERY YEAR.

24:50.250 --> 24:52.959
BUT EVEN THOUGH
HER VOLUNTEER DUTIES

24:53.000 --> 24:55.041
KEPT HER EXTREMELY BUSY,

24:55.083 --> 24:57.291
SHE ALWAYS HAD TIME
FOR HER FAMILY.

24:57.333 --> 25:00.625
SHE WAS ALSO
VERY GOOD AT SPORTS.

25:00.667 --> 25:03.041
SHE HELD
THE STATE HIGH SCHOOL RECORD

25:03.083 --> 25:05.041
FOR THE 50-YARD BACKSTROKE.

25:05.083 --> 25:10.000
THAT RECORD WAS
ONLY RECENTLY BROKEN THIS YEAR.

25:11.667 --> 25:14.625
MY MOTHER WAS A WOMAN
WHO BELIEVED IN ACCOMPLISHMENT

25:14.667 --> 25:16.333
ABOVE ALL ELSE.

25:16.375 --> 25:18.542
I THINK SHE REMAINED TRUE
TO THAT BELIEF

25:18.583 --> 25:22.041
UNTIL THE DAY SHE DIED.

25:22.083 --> 25:24.458
(paper rustles)
MAY SHE REST IN PEACE.

25:36.667 --> 25:40.208
(indistinct conversations)

25:41.834 --> 25:43.542
(chuckles)

25:43.583 --> 25:45.125
ADDISON MAKING IT HARD?

25:45.166 --> 25:47.125
MM. IMPOSSIBLE.

25:47.166 --> 25:49.792
I'VE BEEN THERE.

25:52.709 --> 25:55.083
YOU IN THE MOOD FOR ADVICE
OR JUST ANOTHER DRINK?

25:55.125 --> 25:56.709
BOTH.
ALL RIGHT.

25:56.750 --> 25:58.208
(clears throat)

25:58.250 --> 26:02.041
WHEN CHARLOTTE'S FATHER DIED,
SHE BEAT ME UP

26:02.083 --> 26:04.083
BECAUSE I WAS CLOSE
AND I WAS SAFE.

26:04.125 --> 26:06.458
BUT THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH
YOU CAN TAKE.

26:06.500 --> 26:09.041
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HELP
ADDISON START TO HEAL,

26:09.083 --> 26:10.458

26:10.500 --> 26:12.458
NOT HARD, NOT TO GET EVEN,

26:12.500 --> 26:14.375

SPEAK TO HILARY AGAIN?

31:18.166 --> 31:19.750
YES.

31:19.792 --> 31:22.125
SHE TRIED, BUT I...

31:22.166 --> 31:26.041
I'M SORRY.
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE YOU.

31:26.083 --> 31:29.834
EXCUSE ME, DR. WALLACE.
WE NEED TO PREPARE THE PRISONER.

31:29.875 --> 31:31.208
NO.
(handcuffs clicking)

31:31.250 --> 31:33.083
NO, I'M--I'M NOT READY.

31:33.125 --> 31:36.041
I'M SORRY, BUT IT'S TIME.
NO, I'M NOT READY.
I'M NOT READY. I'M NOT READY.

31:36.083 --> 31:39.041
I'M NOT READY. I'M NOT READY!
I'LL BE THERE
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS.

31:39.083 --> 31:43.041
YOU WON'T BE ALONE.
I'LL BE THERE TILL THE END.

31:43.083 --> 31:46.000
TELL HILARY I AM SORRY.

31:47.750 --> 31:49.583
WHAT KIND OF PILLS
ARE YOU TAKING?

31:49.625 --> 31:52.583
YOU ALREADY SUCCEEDED
IN MAKING ME LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT.

31:52.625 --> 31:55.000
DO I REALLY HAVE TO ENDURE
A LECTURE, TOO?

31:55.041 --> 31:56.792
WHAT KIND OF PILLS?

31:56.834 --> 31:59.291
(pills rattle)

31:59.333 --> 32:01.417
POUR THOSE DOWN THE DRAIN.

32:01.458 --> 32:04.041
THE DOCTOR GAVE ME THESE.

32:04.083 --> 32:05.500
THEY'RE FOR GRIEF.

32:05.542 --> 32:08.041
(laughs) THERE'S
NO MEDICATION FOR GRIEF.

32:08.083 --> 32:10.041
YOU JUST HAVE TO FEEL IT.

32:10.083 --> 32:12.125
AND IF WE DELAY IT
BY TAKING PILLS,

32:12.166 --> 32:15.750
WE JUST GET TO FEEL IT
FOR LONGER.
I THOUGHT VIOLET WAS
THE SHRINK IN THE OUTFIT.

32:15.792 --> 32:17.750
FINE. WHEN YOUR DOCTOR
PRESCRIBED THOSE,

32:17.792 --> 32:20.417
DID HE HAPPEN TO MENTION THAT
YOU SHOULDN'T DRINK WITH THEM?

32:20.458 --> 32:23.041
HE MIGHT HAVE.
YOU'RE LUCKY.
IT'S ONLY BEEN A FEW DAYS.

32:23.083 --> 32:26.041
IF IT HAD BEEN A FEW WEEKS,
YOU WOULD'VE WRECKED YOUR LIVER

32:26.083 --> 32:28.208
AND PROBABLY
MOST OF YOUR RELATIONSHIPS.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.458
SO DRINK IF YOU HAVE TO,
BUT NO MORE PILLS, OKAY?

32:30.500 --> 32:33.250
I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO YOU.
NO, YOU DON'T,
BUT YOU HAVE A SHOT HERE--

32:33.291 --> 32:36.041
A SHOT AT A RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOUR KIDS, A SHOT

32:36.083 --> 32:39.041
TO RIGHT SOME WRONGS BEFORE YOU
FOLLOW IN BIZZY'S FOOTSTEPS.

32:39.083 --> 32:41.750
OH, I SEE.
I TALKED ABOUT YOUR WIFE,

32:41.792 --> 32:44.458
SO NOW YOU GET TO TALK ABOUT
MY WIFE.
I'M TALKING ABOUT YOUR KIDS.

32:44.500 --> 32:46.709
THEY'RE ADULTS.
NOT TODAY.

32:46.750 --> 32:48.917
NOT WHEN THEIR MOTHER
JUST DIED.

32:48.959 --> 32:50.542
THEY'RE YOUR KIDS.

32:50.583 --> 32:53.542
AND THEY NEED YOU
NOT TO BE DRUNK AND STONED

32:53.583 --> 32:55.875
AND... (chuckles)
THROWING PUNCHES

32:55.917 --> 32:59.750
AND BEING
JUST ALL-AROUND USELESS.

32:59.792 --> 33:01.208
THEY NEED THEIR FATHER,

33:01.250 --> 33:03.041
AND THIS MIGHT BE
YOUR LAST SHOT.

33:03.083 --> 33:05.041
AND I'M
JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU

33:05.083 --> 33:06.917
NOT BLOW YOUR LAST SHOT.

33:14.083 --> 33:17.041
I WAS HAPPY
WHEN SUSAN GOT SICK.

33:17.083 --> 33:19.583
I KNOW HOW THAT SOUNDS,

33:19.625 --> 33:23.041
BUT... WHERE WAS BIZZY
GONNA GO WHEN SUSAN DIED?

33:23.083 --> 33:25.375
I WAS ALL SHE KNEW
FOR 40 YEARS.

33:25.417 --> 33:28.000
I ASSUMED SHE'D COME HOME.

33:28.041 --> 33:30.709
YOU KNOW, NOT TO BE ROMANTIC,

33:30.750 --> 33:34.959
JUST... TO LIVE OUT
OUR LIVES TOGETHER

33:35.000 --> 33:37.834
INSTEAD OF ALONE.

33:43.792 --> 33:46.000
I AM SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

33:57.083 --> 34:00.041
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH SUSAN.

34:00.083 --> 34:03.625
IT SEEMS WRONG THAT SHE WASN'T
AT THE MEMORIAL.

34:03.667 --> 34:06.250
I JUST KEEP MOVING HER
FROM ROOM TO ROOM.

34:06.291 --> 34:09.041
THAT WAS A NICE EULOGY.

34:09.083 --> 34:11.000
THANK YOU.

34:11.041 --> 34:13.792
NOW I WANT TO HEAR
THE REAL ONE.

34:13.834 --> 34:16.041
I NEED A DRINK.

34:16.083 --> 34:19.041
I WANT TO HEAR THE REAL ONE.
SAM, I REALLY DON'T HAVE
THE ENERGY FOR THIS.

34:19.083 --> 34:21.208
I WANT TO HEAR THE REAL ONE.
NO, SAM--

34:21.250 --> 34:23.625
BE REAL WITH ME.
SAM--

34:23.667 --> 34:25.834
GIVE ME THE REAL ONE.
I NEED TO HEAR YOUR REAL VOICE.

34:25.875 --> 34:28.000
BECAUSE THIS STEPFORD WASP
THING, IT'S NOT--
SAM, PLEASE BACK UP.

34:28.041 --> 34:30.000
NO, I'M NOT BACKING UP.
SAM, YOU'RE SCARING ME.

34:30.041 --> 34:33.041
NO. WELL, YOU'RE SCARING ME.

34:33.083 --> 34:36.041
I WANT TO HEAR THE REAL EULOGY.
I WANT TO HEAR THE TRUTH.

34:36.083 --> 34:38.583
I WANT TO HEAR FROM THE WOMAN
THAT I LOVE...
BACK OFF, SAM!

34:38.625 --> 34:41.208
FROM THE WOMAN THAT I LOVE--
MY MOTHER DIED.

34:41.250 --> 34:43.250
I KNOW. I KNOW. I KNOW.
(sobs)

34:43.291 --> 34:47.041
I KNOW. IT'S OKAY.

34:47.083 --> 34:50.041
(sobbing)

35:05.959 --> 35:08.041
WHAT TIME IS IT?

35:08.083 --> 35:09.834
LATE.

35:09.875 --> 35:13.667
IT'S GETTING LATE.

35:15.500 --> 35:18.333
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO.

35:18.375 --> 35:20.542
YOU DON'T EVER
HAVE TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

35:20.583 --> 35:22.291
(exhales deeply)

35:22.333 --> 35:26.625
BUT YOU DO HAVE TO ACCEPT
THAT HE IS DYING TONIGHT.

35:28.125 --> 35:31.083
AND AS AWFUL AS THAT...
IS TO ACCEPT,

35:31.125 --> 35:33.083
IT MIGHT GIVE YOU A CHANCE

35:33.125 --> 35:35.083
TO SAY GOOD-BYE
ON YOUR OWN TERMS.

35:35.125 --> 35:37.750
GIVE YOU A CHANCE AT LEAST

35:37.792 --> 35:41.375
TO TELL HIM YOU LOVE HIM.

35:41.417 --> 35:43.875
HE KNOWS I LOVE HIM.
(sniffles)

35:43.917 --> 35:46.166
IF THERE'S ONE THING
THAT MAN HAS TO KNOW,

35:46.208 --> 35:48.333
IT'S THAT I LOVE HIM.

35:48.375 --> 35:52.041
THE WAY YOU LEFT THIS MORNING,
HE MIGHT DOUBT IT.

35:52.083 --> 35:54.834
IF I WERE HIM,
I WOULD DOUBT IT.

36:01.458 --> 36:03.333
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP HERE?

36:03.375 --> 36:05.041
OH, I'M HONORING BIZZY.

36:05.083 --> 36:07.041
NOT THAT SHE EVER GOT
SLOPPY DRUNK.

36:07.083 --> 36:11.041
SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT HER,
THE WOMAN COULD HOLD HER LIQUOR.

36:11.083 --> 36:13.333
COME ON BACK TO THE HOUSE.
I'LL MAKE YOU SOME COFFEE.

36:13.375 --> 36:16.083
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO.

36:16.125 --> 36:18.041
AHH.

36:18.083 --> 36:21.083
YOU AND ME, HOW'D WE END UP
SUCH MESSES, HUH?

36:21.125 --> 36:24.834
(groans)

36:24.875 --> 36:26.917
LOOK AT US.

36:26.959 --> 36:30.083
YOU'RE SCREWING
YOUR BEST FRIEND'S EX,

36:30.125 --> 36:33.041
AND I'M--WELL, I'M SCREWING
ANYTHING WITH A PULSE.

36:33.083 --> 36:35.041
(sighs) I...
(rubs hands together)

36:35.083 --> 36:37.041
AM IN LOVE WITH SAM.
HUH.

36:37.083 --> 36:40.125
AND YOU ARE UP HERE
ALL ALONE, GRIEVING,

36:40.166 --> 36:43.542
BECAUSE WE'RE REAL PEOPLE
WITH REAL FEELINGS...

36:43.583 --> 36:46.834
DESPITE BIZZY'S BEST EXAMPLE.

36:46.875 --> 36:49.709
WELL, HERE'S TO THAT.

36:52.500 --> 36:55.041
(inhales and exhales deeply)

36:55.083 --> 36:57.083
SHE KILLED HERSELF, ARCHER.

37:01.375 --> 37:03.291
IT WASN'T AN ANEURYSM
OR A HEART ATTACK.

37:03.333 --> 37:05.417
SHE TOOK SOME...

37:05.458 --> 37:08.458
TOOK A BOTTLE OF PILLS.

37:11.750 --> 37:14.041
WELL, ISN'T THAT
JUST PAR FOR THE COURSE?

37:14.083 --> 37:16.583
I'VE SPENT SO MUCH OF MY LIFE
JUDGING PEOPLE.

37:16.625 --> 37:19.583
YOU KNOW THAT?
I'VE BEEN SO JUDGMENTAL.

37:19.625 --> 37:22.041
IT WAS ACTUALLY
ONE OF THE FEW TRAITS

37:22.083 --> 37:24.083
I DID GET FROM BIZZY.

37:24.125 --> 37:27.667
I MEAN, WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,
I WOULD'VE THOUGHT IT WAS WEAK.

37:27.709 --> 37:30.291
SUICIDE--IT'S SO WEAK.

37:30.333 --> 37:33.041
I MEAN,
WHAT WAS SHE THINKING?

37:33.083 --> 37:35.041
HOW COULD SHE DO THAT
TO US--

37:35.083 --> 37:37.041
TO THE CAPTAIN,
TO HER CHILDREN?

37:37.083 --> 37:39.792
BUT... WHEN I FOUND HER...

37:42.750 --> 37:45.583
ALL I THOUGHT WAS, WELL...

37:47.166 --> 37:49.041
THAT'S THAT.

37:49.083 --> 37:54.458
PEOPLE WHO DO THAT,
THEY'RE NOT... THINKING.

37:54.500 --> 37:58.291
SHE WASN'T THINKING,
LAYING THERE BROKEN.

37:58.333 --> 38:02.917
SHE WAS BROKEN FROM GRIEF.

38:02.959 --> 38:07.875
SHE WAS OUT TO SEA
AND SHE DROWNED.

38:07.917 --> 38:10.041
IT DOESN'T MAKE HER SELFISH.

38:10.083 --> 38:12.041
IT DOESN'T EVEN MEAN

38:12.083 --> 38:14.709
THAT SHE DIDN'T LOVE US
IN HER OWN WAY.

38:19.709 --> 38:21.667
MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT I WOULD'VE SAID.

38:21.709 --> 38:25.125
IF I COULD'VE TOLD THE TRUTH,
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD'VE SAID.

38:37.083 --> 38:40.917
I NEED TO SEE MY HUSBAND--
BRETT LOVEMAN.
I'M SORRY, MA'AM.

38:40.959 --> 38:43.000
SHE ONLY NEEDS A FEW MINUTES.
ONCE A PRISONER IS IN PREP,

38:43.041 --> 38:44.750
HE ISN'T ALLOWED
ANY MORE OUTSIDE CONTACT.

38:44.792 --> 38:48.208
I CAN LET YOU IN TO WITNESS
THE EXECUTION, BUT THAT'S IT.

38:48.250 --> 38:51.041
(crying) NO, PLEASE.
I DON'T--

38:51.083 --> 38:54.959
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DO THAT.
OKAY, LISTEN TO ME.
I DON'T SAY THIS LIGHTLY.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.959
YOU ARE
ONE OF THE STRONGEST PEOPLE

38:57.000 --> 38:58.959
I HAVE EVER HAD THE HONOR
OF KNOWING.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.625
SO THE QUESTION ISN'T
CAN YOU DO IT.

39:01.667 --> 39:04.375
IT'S DO YOU WANT TO.
