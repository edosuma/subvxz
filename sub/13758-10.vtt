- Oh, my God.
Are you--

18:11.924 --> 18:14.051
{\an1}- Prancer.
Yeah, that's right.

18:14.134 --> 18:15.344
<i>It's me, Prancer.</i>

18:15.427 --> 18:17.346
{\an1}Everybody's favorite
[bleep] reindeer, right?

18:17.429 --> 18:18.597
And this is Santa Claus.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.265
And unless you jam
that insulin needle

18:20.349 --> 18:21.016
{\an1}into his fat
[bleep] chest,

18:21.099 --> 18:24.186
{\an1}Christmas is canceled.
Forever.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.146
{\an1}<i>Oh, shit.</i>
<i>we're losing him.</i>

18:26.230 --> 18:27.856
{\an1}Kid, come on!
I'd do it myself,

18:27.940 --> 18:29.441
but I have hooves.
- But--but--

18:29.525 --> 18:32.444
- "But--but--but,"
but nothing! Do it!

18:32.528 --> 18:34.029
- Do it, Jimmy.
Save Christmas!

18:34.112 --> 18:36.115
- Do it, Jimmy.

18:36.198 --> 18:39.368
- Fine!
Okay!

18:39.451 --> 18:41.578
Here...we...go!

18:41.662 --> 18:42.830
- Whoa!

18:42.913 --> 18:45.874
- Yes! There we go.
- Jesus.

18:45.958 --> 18:46.792
Thank you, boys.

18:46.875 --> 18:51.213
Merry Christmas...I guess.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.257
You were very nice this year.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.634
Not naughty.
Ho, ho, ho, ho

18:55.717 --> 18:57.636
- No more cookies, dude.
Seriously.

18:57.719 --> 19:02.391
{\an1}- I know, I know.
- Oh, do you, you fat [bleep].

19:02.474 --> 19:05.185
- [sobbing]

19:05.269 --> 19:08.021
{\an3}- You know, I learned
something today, Steve.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.440
- What's that, Roy?
- French, you dipshit.

19:10.524 --> 19:11.692
{\an3}Didn't you see me
walking around

19:11.775 --> 19:14.236
{\an3}with these damn headphones
on all day?

19:14.319 --> 19:15.571
- Oh, right.
- But actually,

19:15.654 --> 19:17.030
I learned that
during the holidays,

19:17.114 --> 19:20.158
there's nothing more important
than family.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.410
Because no matter what,

19:21.493 --> 19:22.661
they've always got
your back.

19:22.744 --> 19:24.746
- You know, Roy, you're right.
I guess I am pretty lucky.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.790
I mean, my mom did make me
this sweet ass jacket.

19:26.874 --> 19:29.418
- Asshole!
- Gah!

19:29.501 --> 19:32.546
- That your sister?
- Yeah.

19:32.629 --> 19:35.215
{\an3}Hmm.
She got a fella?
