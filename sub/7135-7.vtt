Truth is, bro, you don't
got to do nothing.

52:20.633 --> 52:23.000
Rumor has it the Aryans
are going to whack Said.

52:23.066 --> 52:25.033
- Yeah, when?

52:25.100 --> 52:27.100
- I'd say right now.

52:33.834 --> 52:35.934
- I know you're gonna
think this is bullshit,

52:36.000 --> 52:41.000
but I feel badly about
my part in Andy's death.

52:42.233 --> 52:44.266
I'm so sorry.

52:45.767 --> 52:49.734
Losing a kid...
there's nothing worse.

52:49.800 --> 52:51.367
And I want to
make it up to you.

52:51.600 --> 52:53.934
- How?

52:54.000 --> 52:56.934
How the fuck will you
ever make that up to me?

52:57.000 --> 52:59.467
- You have another son.
You don't know where he is.

52:59.533 --> 53:00.734
Through the private
investigators

53:00.800 --> 53:03.467
at my old law office,
I could find him.

53:03.533 --> 53:05.300
- And that's supposed
to even the score?

53:05.367 --> 53:07.500
Make everything okay
between us?

53:07.567 --> 53:10.400
- It's a start.

53:10.467 --> 53:12.066
- Beecher, you're crazier
than I thought.

53:14.800 --> 53:16.867
There's only one thing that's
gonna make this all okay.

53:18.200 --> 53:19.767
You...dead.

53:21.066 --> 53:22.100
- No!

53:27.266 --> 53:28.700
- Cyril, Cyril, Cyril--no!

53:28.767 --> 53:33.166
[alarm blaring]
[men shouting]

53:36.300 --> 53:38.400
- Aah!
- Beecher!

53:38.467 --> 53:40.533
Beecher!

53:40.600 --> 53:42.233
[alarm blaring]
Beecher!

53:42.300 --> 53:43.700
- Ah...fuck.

53:51.200 --> 53:54.400
Lockdown!
[guard shouting]

53:54.467 --> 53:56.000
Come on, come on, come on.
Move it.

53:56.066 --> 53:58.533
Let's go.
Move it.

53:58.600 --> 54:01.367
- People are defined
by three things:

54:01.433 --> 54:04.166
[gate buzzes]
their heads...

54:06.633 --> 54:08.133
How they think...

54:12.367 --> 54:15.300
Their hearts...

54:15.367 --> 54:17.900
what they feel...

54:17.967 --> 54:19.400
their dicks...

54:19.467 --> 54:22.100
who they fuck.

54:23.033 --> 54:24.567
At the end of the day,

54:24.633 --> 54:28.133
each of us
has to answer one question...

54:28.200 --> 54:32.467
One not so simple question.

54:33.367 --> 54:36.734
Who am I?

54:36.800 --> 54:40.166
Who am  I?
