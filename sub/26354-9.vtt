00:22.666 --> 00:24.865
Tina, slow down.
What's the rush?

00:24.930 --> 00:27.677
Yeah. Savor your cereal,
you monster.

00:27.742 --> 00:28.779
I can't look away.

00:28.844 --> 00:30.794
It's like
watching a crazed otter.

00:30.859 --> 00:32.029
I just wanna
get to school.

00:32.094 --> 00:33.302
Ms. Jacobson is
pairing us up

00:33.367 --> 00:34.732
with our Science Fair partners
today.

00:34.797 --> 00:36.201
It's fun
not knowing who it'll be.

00:36.266 --> 00:37.826
Ooh, exciting.

00:37.891 --> 00:39.810
Will it be a new friend?
An old friend?

00:39.875 --> 00:41.029
What if it's Jimmy Junior?

00:41.094 --> 00:42.958
We won't get a lot of work
done, if you know what I mean.

00:43.023 --> 00:44.078
Eh? Right?

00:44.164 --> 00:46.341
Mm. I mean, it wouldn't
hurt if you got paired

00:46.406 --> 00:47.817
with someone
who could get an "A."

00:47.882 --> 00:49.379
It's not up to me
who I get paired with.

00:49.444 --> 00:51.102
I mean,
life is full of possibilities.

00:51.167 --> 00:52.535
Maybe I'll get a good
grade in science...

00:52.600 --> 00:53.951
Or maybe
you'll go to summer school.

00:54.016 --> 00:55.214
Exactly.
She gets it.

00:55.279 --> 00:56.847
Plus, grades ain't nothin'
but a number.

00:56.912 --> 00:59.523
All right, one more
bite and... I'm done.

00:59.645 --> 01:01.117
It's time
for a great day.

01:02.214 --> 01:03.321
I'm okay.

01:03.816 --> 01:04.907
Who's ready to find out

01:04.971 --> 01:06.441
who their
Science Fair partner is?

01:06.574 --> 01:08.702
Hell, yeah.
Uh, I mean, sure.

01:08.767 --> 01:10.633
Jocelyn,
you're with...

01:10.700 --> 01:12.087
Please say Tammy,
please say Tammy,

01:12.152 --> 01:13.767
- please say Tammy.
- Jimmy Junior.

01:13.832 --> 01:15.028
Oh, cool.

01:15.120 --> 01:17.641
And Tammy,
you're with Zeke.

01:17.708 --> 01:19.196
- Tamma-lamma-ding-dong.
- Ugh.

01:19.261 --> 01:20.727
Calm down, Zeke.

01:20.792 --> 01:22.173
Henry,
your partner is...

01:22.238 --> 01:24.659
- Actually, I can't have a partner.
- What?

01:24.724 --> 01:26.343
I'm not supposed to
work with other people.

01:26.408 --> 01:27.938
Here's a doctor's note.

01:28.003 --> 01:29.790
It says I'm not supposed
to work with other people.

01:29.855 --> 01:31.003
Seriously?

01:31.106 --> 01:33.120
Uh, I'm sorry,
are-are you a doctor?

01:33.185 --> 01:34.758
Fine.
You're-You're working alone.

01:34.825 --> 01:35.730
Yes.

01:35.808 --> 01:38.428
- Mmm. That's kinda sad, Henry.
- It's not sad, it's medical.

01:38.493 --> 01:40.264
Okay, let's move on. Tina,

01:40.363 --> 01:42.122
you're partners with Susmita.

01:42.230 --> 01:44.341
Nice.
What's up, new friend? High five?

01:44.488 --> 01:47.091
I, uh, can't reach.

01:47.158 --> 01:49.665
Wait, we can do this.

01:49.816 --> 01:52.082
We're touching fingers.

01:52.196 --> 01:53.935
That counts. Boom.

01:54.238 --> 01:55.618
I got an idea for a project.

01:55.685 --> 01:57.134
My grandma said
all the bees are dying.

01:57.199 --> 01:58.196
We're gonna run outta
honey,

01:58.261 --> 02:00.376
and I am not using
agave like some idiot.

02:00.441 --> 02:01.914
I've always wanted
to know, like,

02:01.979 --> 02:04.956
why birds can fly
and not people.

02:05.021 --> 02:07.466
Yeah, and why do birds
always look at me weird?

02:07.533 --> 02:09.223
What about
peanut butter?

02:09.291 --> 02:11.649
- What about peanut butter?
- There's no butter in it,

02:11.714 --> 02:14.504
and yet it's called peanut butter.
Pretty crazy, right?

02:14.571 --> 02:17.125
Maybe it's just 'cause
it spreads like butter?

02:17.192 --> 02:18.347
Hmm. Yeah.

02:18.425 --> 02:19.582
So should we just do that?

02:19.647 --> 02:21.310
Well, I've actually
always wanted

02:21.377 --> 02:22.817
to build a radio telescope.

02:22.884 --> 02:24.027
Oh. Totally.

02:24.092 --> 02:25.235
What is that?

02:25.300 --> 02:29.571
So a radio telescope is like
a telescope for your ears.

02:29.636 --> 02:32.001
- Got it. Headphones.
- Nope. Not headphones.

02:32.066 --> 02:33.110
Exactly. Keep going.

02:33.175 --> 02:35.353
See, with a bunch of
modifications, you can use

02:35.418 --> 02:38.110
a regular home TV satellite
dish to study the radio waves

02:38.175 --> 02:39.837
from astronomical objects.

02:39.911 --> 02:41.186
We could build one and

02:41.251 --> 02:42.454
point it at the Sun.

02:42.519 --> 02:43.698
I don't know
what you just said,

02:43.763 --> 02:45.325
but it sounds like
an "A."

02:45.432 --> 02:46.656
And I'm really
embarrassed

02:46.721 --> 02:48.728
I suggested that
super cool A-minus

02:48.793 --> 02:49.985
peanut butter idea.
So,

02:50.050 --> 02:51.798
how about since you
know how to do all that,

02:51.863 --> 02:53.173
why don't
I take care of making us

02:53.238 --> 02:54.970
the best damn Science Fair
board you've ever seen?

02:55.035 --> 02:56.415
My bubble letters are
amazing.

02:56.480 --> 02:57.978
I mean,
they're pretty good.

02:58.043 --> 02:59.079
They're-they're fine.

02:59.144 --> 03:00.720
I might not
do bubble letters.

03:01.366 --> 03:02.829
You want some more coffee,
Teddy?

03:02.894 --> 03:05.001
Yeah. Uh,
what if it was called sneezey

03:05.066 --> 03:06.337
instead of cough-ey?

03:06.402 --> 03:07.571
- Get it, Bob? Get it?
- Hmm.

03:07.636 --> 03:09.884
Now I don't wanna give you
any more. Ooh, they're here.

03:09.949 --> 03:11.863
You have four more just like
that in your truck, right?

03:11.928 --> 03:13.695
And I can't wait to
carry them all in here.

03:13.793 --> 03:16.575
- He loves carrying things.
- I'm livin' the dream.

03:16.948 --> 03:18.095
So you know
how I've wanted

03:18.160 --> 03:19.369
a coat-rack
for the restaurant?

03:19.434 --> 03:20.641
Well, I was shopping online

03:20.706 --> 03:22.123
and I couldn't decide
which one to get.

03:22.188 --> 03:23.724
How many
coat-racks can there be?

03:23.817 --> 03:24.985
Lin. So many.

03:25.050 --> 03:26.313
Some have
circular mounts,

03:26.378 --> 03:28.540
some have tripod stands,
some are aluminum.

03:28.605 --> 03:31.090
Some look like actual
trees, those are fun.

03:31.157 --> 03:32.946
Okay.
So you bought five of 'em?

03:33.011 --> 03:34.618
Yes. Because
I'm a brilliant shopper.

03:34.683 --> 03:36.350
They were on sale,
so I bought five.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.033
Now I can see them
in person,

03:38.100 --> 03:39.890
pick my favorite, and
return the other four.

03:39.957 --> 03:41.063
- Genius.
- Wait.

03:41.128 --> 03:42.785
- Did you say they were on sale?
- Yeah.

03:42.852 --> 03:44.400
And you're sure
you can return them?

03:44.467 --> 03:46.321
- Yes.
- But they were on sale.

03:46.386 --> 03:48.774
- Wh-what are you getting at?
- Show me the website.

03:48.839 --> 03:50.780
Trust me. I definitely
wouldn't have bought them

03:50.847 --> 03:52.450
if you couldn't return...
Oh, no.

03:52.517 --> 03:54.563
No, no, no.
I can't return them.

03:54.628 --> 03:56.227
Great. Now we own
five coat-racks.

03:56.292 --> 03:57.316
Damn it.

03:57.394 --> 03:59.083
Hm. Why-Why are the boxes so small?

03:59.185 --> 04:01.982
You probably have to
assemble them. I'm guessing.

04:02.199 --> 04:04.482
- Oh, my God.
- It's for kids.

04:04.586 --> 04:06.481
Did you buy five children's
coat-racks?

04:06.580 --> 04:08.243
We can't pay for
five coat-racks.

04:08.308 --> 04:10.278
I mean, we did.
So what do we do?

04:10.371 --> 04:11.716
I guess you're selling 'em.

04:11.863 --> 04:14.298
Do you want to
buy a tiny coat-rack, Teddy?

04:14.365 --> 04:16.642
Now I bet you wish you'd
laughed at my sneezey joke.

04:16.707 --> 04:18.435
I do. I really do.

04:18.863 --> 04:21.098
So, you guys are
gonna listen to the Sun?

04:21.165 --> 04:23.774
Just don't listen to anything
the Moon says;

04:23.839 --> 04:24.958
he's a liar.

04:25.027 --> 04:26.954
Quick S.F.Q...
Science Fair question.

04:27.019 --> 04:29.228
Is there anything else
we could listen to besides the sun?

04:29.293 --> 04:32.001
Well, I was gonna use
my parents' old TV dish,

04:32.066 --> 04:34.724
but if we had a bigger one,
we could listen to planets,

04:34.808 --> 04:37.723
or satellites, or even try to
listen for extraterrestrials.

04:37.790 --> 04:40.063
Aliens? Well, yeah,
Susmita. Let's do that.

04:40.128 --> 04:42.457
- I mean, we could try.
- Wait.

04:42.524 --> 04:44.670
Why are we just gonna sit
back and listen for aliens?

04:44.777 --> 04:47.053
Can we send a message
out? Can we talk to them?

04:47.120 --> 04:49.691
Well, we don't actually
know if anything's out there.

04:49.758 --> 04:51.321
But what if
the aliens are out there,

04:51.386 --> 04:53.391
but they're also just sitting
back and listening for us?

04:53.456 --> 04:55.876
I mean, if Tom Hanks never
sent Meg Ryan that first e-mail,

04:55.941 --> 04:57.579
that movie would have been
called You've Got Computer.

04:57.644 --> 04:59.454
'Cause they both would have just
been sitting at their computers.

04:59.519 --> 05:00.703
That was the prequel.

05:00.768 --> 05:02.464
I guess
if we had a bigger dish,

05:02.529 --> 05:04.017
we could send out a message.

05:04.082 --> 05:06.001
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop it.

05:06.066 --> 05:08.786
Whatever you do,
do not "send out a message."

05:08.927 --> 05:10.768
What? Why...
not, Henry?

05:10.835 --> 05:12.187
Because
we don't want

05:12.252 --> 05:13.542
the Earth to be
obliterated?

05:13.607 --> 05:14.707
What are you
talking about?

05:14.772 --> 05:16.291
If you contact aliens,

05:16.356 --> 05:17.835
they will come
and destroy us.

05:17.909 --> 05:19.886
What? How do you know they
won't be super friendly?

05:19.951 --> 05:22.471
Based on simple probability,
there should be at least

05:22.538 --> 05:25.538
a hundred thousand civilizations
in our galaxy, right?

05:25.647 --> 05:28.706
And at least a thousand
Type III civilizations.

05:28.773 --> 05:30.840
I think you mean diabetes?
But go on.

05:30.907 --> 05:32.628
Type III civilizations.

05:32.695 --> 05:34.519
That means
that they're billions

05:34.584 --> 05:36.230
of years
more advanced than us.

05:36.295 --> 05:39.245
They can harness the
energy of the entire galaxy

05:39.373 --> 05:41.218
and travel between stars.

05:41.285 --> 05:42.902
Stars are just like us.

05:42.967 --> 05:44.074
That's right, Jocelyn.

05:44.139 --> 05:46.832
But we haven't met them.
Why? Well,

05:46.897 --> 05:49.339
it's probably because
one of these civilizations

05:49.404 --> 05:52.432
is massively predatory and is
wiping out the rest of them.

05:52.529 --> 05:54.910
Damn those
Type III civilizations.

05:54.975 --> 05:58.136
So our only hope of
survival is going unnoticed,

05:58.201 --> 05:59.542
so they don't ever
find us.

05:59.607 --> 06:02.433
Therefore,
do not send out a signal.

06:02.498 --> 06:03.725
This teacher has a point.

06:03.792 --> 06:05.730
What? I'm-I'm not a teacher.

06:05.795 --> 06:06.828
I'm in your grade.

06:06.895 --> 06:08.863
Mm, no.
You're a teacher. Trust me.

06:08.928 --> 06:11.652
But you don't know that aliens are
flying around killing everybody.

06:11.717 --> 06:12.777
Oh, my God.

06:12.842 --> 06:14.893
I mean, what if they're flying
around helping everybody?

06:14.958 --> 06:16.230
Like in a big space ambulance,

06:16.295 --> 06:18.143
and when they get our message,
they'll be really excited

06:18.208 --> 06:19.449
to come and see
if we need anything.

06:19.514 --> 06:21.160
Yeah, they could be
super chill.

06:21.225 --> 06:22.377
I don't know, Tina.

06:22.442 --> 06:24.057
I'm kind of on Team Henry
with this one.

06:24.122 --> 06:25.737
What if you're the one
that ends the world?

06:25.802 --> 06:27.159
You don't wanna
be that guy.

06:27.224 --> 06:28.901
What if they want to
harvest our penises?

06:28.966 --> 06:30.346
And who would
blame them?

06:30.411 --> 06:32.229
Susmita, we're not gonna
let this guy scare us

06:32.294 --> 06:33.518
out of a good grade,
are we?

06:33.583 --> 06:36.503
Uh... I'm not scared
if you're not scared.

06:36.568 --> 06:37.729
The only thing I'm scared of

06:37.794 --> 06:39.475
is how much of an "A"
we're gonna get.

06:40.575 --> 06:43.556
Hmm. "Meet in
Branca's supply closet."

06:43.621 --> 06:45.426
"at 2:55."

06:46.371 --> 06:48.541
Thank you for coming.
Did anyone follow you?

06:48.606 --> 06:50.377
Gene's fart did.
Apparently.

06:50.442 --> 06:53.697
Sorry. I thought I lost it in
the hallway, but she found me.

06:53.762 --> 06:54.857
We need to talk.

06:54.934 --> 06:57.002
We have to stop
Tina and Susmita,

06:57.067 --> 06:58.189
and I have a plan.

06:58.254 --> 07:01.183
But it involves you
going against your own sister.

07:01.250 --> 07:03.752
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We would never do that.

07:03.817 --> 07:05.850
- You will be compensated.
- We'll do it.

07:05.915 --> 07:08.502
I hope you have connections
in the frozen yogurt world,

07:08.567 --> 07:11.482
'cause this boy works
strictly for gift cards.

07:14.918 --> 07:17.713
- So this is your dad?
- I wish.

07:17.778 --> 07:19.435
- He's my dad's friend.
- Best friend.

07:19.512 --> 07:20.806
Are you two, uh,
best friends?

07:20.871 --> 07:22.247
We're getting there.
I mean,

07:22.314 --> 07:23.923
we're pretty great
Science Fair partners.

07:23.988 --> 07:25.043
Where'd you get the dish?

07:25.108 --> 07:27.002
I demo'd
an old sports bar last week

07:27.067 --> 07:28.408
and they had this thing
out back.

07:28.473 --> 07:30.494
I was gonna use it to
watch hockey talk shows,

07:30.568 --> 07:32.326
but now it's gonna
talk to aliens.

07:32.391 --> 07:34.654
What a life
this dish is having.

07:35.223 --> 07:37.176
Eh.

07:37.254 --> 07:38.362
And done.

07:38.440 --> 07:39.612
So, ready to go?

07:39.677 --> 07:41.189
Should we e-mail some aliens?

07:41.254 --> 07:42.293
Oh, no.

07:42.371 --> 07:43.767
We still have
a coupleof things to do

07:43.832 --> 07:45.069
before we turn it on.

07:45.134 --> 07:47.158
Hey,
how's our Science Fair board?

07:47.223 --> 07:50.564
Uh, I'm kicking some serious
butt on it, that's how it is.

07:50.629 --> 07:52.185
I haven't started it yet.

07:52.285 --> 07:54.437
Um, but it's gonna be s-so good.

07:54.911 --> 07:56.670
All right,
let's get to work.

07:59.781 --> 08:01.084
So what do we do now?

08:01.149 --> 08:03.455
First, we have to
teach them our language.

08:03.524 --> 08:04.591
How do we do that?

08:04.656 --> 08:06.794
Make them watch TV all day
like the mermaid in Splash?

08:06.859 --> 08:08.904
I was thinking
we send a binary code

08:08.969 --> 08:11.388
as a kind of
Rosetta stone pictograph.

08:11.453 --> 08:13.826
Hopefully, it can teach them
enough to start a conversation.

08:13.891 --> 08:15.318
Sorry, now I'm just
thinking about Splash.

08:15.383 --> 08:18.169
And then, to send our
message, we use Morse code.

08:18.234 --> 08:20.224
There's also Turner &
Hooch. Anything there?

08:20.289 --> 08:23.201
Maybe we should focus on what
we're gonna say in our message?

08:23.266 --> 08:25.754
Good point. How do you say
"Tom Hanks" in Morse code?

08:25.821 --> 08:27.727
Doo. Doo-doo-doo.
Doo doo.

08:27.794 --> 08:30.099
Doo-doo-doo-doo. Doo-doo.
Doo-doo doo-doo-doo.

08:30.164 --> 08:31.326
- Doo-doo-doo.
- Nice.

08:31.391 --> 08:33.318
One burger-of-the-day
coming right up.

08:33.383 --> 08:36.404
Uh-Ahem.
Tell 'em about our special, Bob.

08:36.469 --> 08:39.068
Right, uh, we're
also having a special today.

08:39.133 --> 08:41.274
With the purchase of any burger,
we'll throw in, uh,

08:41.341 --> 08:43.616
a... coat-rack for just $59.

08:43.683 --> 08:44.943
I'm sorry? A-A what?

08:45.008 --> 08:46.247
A-A-A
coat-rack.

08:46.314 --> 08:48.434
- Uh, just show him.
- Oh. All right.

08:48.633 --> 08:50.587
- Uh, d-do you like this one?
- What is that?

08:50.654 --> 08:52.396
Is-Is that a little
model of a coat-rack?

08:52.461 --> 08:54.029
No, no, no.
This, this is the coat-rack.

08:54.094 --> 08:55.818
Oh. I-I thought it was like

08:55.883 --> 08:58.943
when you go buy a tent and
they have a little tiny model

08:59.008 --> 09:00.584
of a tent on display;
I-I love those.

09:00.651 --> 09:03.568
Aw. Tiny tents.
For little runaway mice.

09:03.633 --> 09:06.341
So how many coat-racks
can I put you down for?

09:06.406 --> 09:08.373
I'll tell ya what. If I have a baby

09:08.438 --> 09:09.888
and that baby buys a little coat,

09:09.953 --> 09:12.525
I'll come back in here and get
one of your little coat-racks.

09:12.633 --> 09:14.042
Thank you.

09:14.681 --> 09:16.584
Tina and Susmita
are still in here.

09:16.649 --> 09:17.896
He's it going out there?

09:17.961 --> 09:19.966
Good. I have
to cut the wire going

09:20.031 --> 09:23.367
from their telescope's
amplifier to their transmitter.

09:23.434 --> 09:26.490
It'll basically create a
private Morse code network

09:26.555 --> 09:28.474
between their telescope
and my laptop.

09:28.539 --> 09:30.099
Just gimme a heads up

09:30.164 --> 09:31.513
when you're outside.

09:31.578 --> 09:32.763
I've been outside.

09:32.828 --> 09:35.334
And I've been looking
at you this whole time.

09:35.399 --> 09:36.931
Really good job out there, buddy.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.248
They're on the move.

09:38.313 --> 09:39.552
I need more time.

09:39.617 --> 09:41.091
- Stall them.
- On it.

09:41.156 --> 09:42.584
Classic hall-stall.

09:42.649 --> 09:44.888
Hey, what's up, T?
Hi, Susmita.

09:44.953 --> 09:46.763
How's the Science Fair stuff going?

09:46.828 --> 09:49.174
Good. Um, we're kind of in
the middle of it right now.

09:49.274 --> 09:52.533
Oh, ho-ho. So cool.

09:52.680 --> 09:54.388
Tell me all about it.

09:54.453 --> 09:57.439
We programmed a message that'll
hopefully teach aliens English.

09:57.547 --> 09:58.912
We're about to go send it off.

09:58.977 --> 10:01.451
- Um, see you later.
- Wait. I'm so proud of you.

10:01.516 --> 10:02.552
Oh.

10:02.644 --> 10:04.104
What are you doing?

10:04.171 --> 10:06.341
Shh. Just ten more seconds.

10:06.406 --> 10:07.826
Get in here, Susmita.

10:07.891 --> 10:09.599
I'm proud of you, too.

10:09.664 --> 10:11.880
Uh, okay. Um, bye, Louise.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.088
Thanks for the long
hug that kind of hurt.

10:14.234 --> 10:16.263
The possums are
out of the trap.

10:16.328 --> 10:17.400
Get out of there, Haber.

10:17.484 --> 10:19.848
- Copy.
- Your walkie-talkie is sticky.

10:19.913 --> 10:21.817
It's my brother's.
He threw up on it.

10:21.882 --> 10:23.274
Yeah, that checks out.

10:23.507 --> 10:25.532
Okay, the Rosetta code
is sent.

10:25.617 --> 10:27.850
Now we can follow up
with our first message.

10:27.917 --> 10:28.976
Oh, boy.

10:29.054 --> 10:30.630
We just type
our message here,

10:30.695 --> 10:33.513
it translates it into Morse code,
and then we can send it off.

10:33.578 --> 10:35.005
It'll take about a day

10:35.070 --> 10:37.489
for the message to get out to
the edge of our solar system.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.091
And then if somebody is
flying by

10:39.156 --> 10:41.461
and gets our message
and wants to answer,

10:41.528 --> 10:43.473
it'll take another day
before we hear back.

10:43.538 --> 10:44.598
Do you want to write it?

10:44.663 --> 10:46.013
Uh, yeah. Wow.

10:46.078 --> 10:47.747
Man, I don't know
what to write.

10:47.812 --> 10:49.303
Lot of pressure.
Let's see, uh...

10:49.406 --> 10:50.997
"What's shakin', bacon?

10:51.062 --> 10:52.762
"Oh, you might not know
what bacon is.

10:52.827 --> 10:54.763
"It's from
adorable animals called pigs.

10:54.828 --> 10:56.309
"They're pink. We kill them,

10:56.374 --> 10:58.103
"take out their bacon,
and eat it.

10:58.170 --> 11:00.416
Um, we won't kill you
though, uh..."

11:00.483 --> 11:02.512
- Wh-Why don't I type?
- No, no, no, I got it.

11:02.577 --> 11:04.392
- Um, "Greetings from Earth"?
- Yeah.

11:04.492 --> 11:06.234
- And then "xoxo"?
- Sure.

11:06.301 --> 11:07.890
And send.

11:14.858 --> 11:17.394
I bet we get a message
back in three,

11:17.459 --> 11:18.516
two,

11:18.594 --> 11:19.679
one.

11:19.757 --> 11:22.895
- Damn.
- Tina, can I ask you something?

11:22.960 --> 11:24.649
- Of course, partner.
- So,

11:24.718 --> 11:27.231
you know how sometimes
you talk to boys and stuff?

11:27.296 --> 11:28.606
- Big-time.
- Well,

11:28.673 --> 11:31.106
there's this boy
I kind of like, but...

11:31.171 --> 11:32.606
Never mind,
never-never mind.

11:32.673 --> 11:34.601
Come on, do like this
thing and dish, girl.

11:34.710 --> 11:36.571
Well, the problem is,

11:36.703 --> 11:38.110
he's kind of aloof.

11:38.265 --> 11:39.911
Got it.
Dangerous bad boy.

11:39.976 --> 11:41.733
I can work with that.
Have you made a move?

11:41.800 --> 11:44.532
No, I don't think
he's into me. Or anyone.

11:44.632 --> 11:46.583
Look, I know it's scary
to put yourself out there.

11:46.648 --> 11:49.153
- It is.
- But it's like jumping into a pool.

11:49.218 --> 11:51.739
If you don't take the leap,
then you're just the girl

11:51.804 --> 11:53.973
in her bathing suit
looking at a pool.

11:54.038 --> 11:55.888
Whoa, it's the aliens!

11:55.953 --> 11:58.134
Hang on. It's probably
just interference.

11:58.507 --> 12:00.266
Wait, that's Morse code.

12:00.333 --> 12:01.386
What does that mean?

12:01.451 --> 12:03.247
We made contact, Tina.

12:03.312 --> 12:05.091
Holy crap!
What does the message say?

12:05.156 --> 12:07.753
I don't know. We have to wait
for the pattern to start over.

12:07.820 --> 12:08.880
This is incredible.

12:08.945 --> 12:10.356
We made contact.

12:10.507 --> 12:12.489
I'm your alien now, Tina.

12:12.554 --> 12:14.341
All right, we did it.
Now pay up.

12:14.406 --> 12:16.966
Yeah! Where's our
frozen yogurt gift card?!

12:17.031 --> 12:18.736
I've got your gift card
right here.

12:18.803 --> 12:20.676
- Gimme, gimme, gimme!
- Not so fast.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.470
You'll get it
when the job's done.

12:22.562 --> 12:24.161
But may
I recommend no toppings?

12:24.226 --> 12:25.309
That's how they get you.

12:25.374 --> 12:26.645
Yeah, it really
weighs down your cup.

12:26.710 --> 12:27.916
I use Rice Krispies.

12:27.983 --> 12:29.473
It adds crunch
and it weighs nothing.

12:29.538 --> 12:31.059
Amateur, amateur, amateur!

12:31.124 --> 12:33.228
Speaking of heaping
too much on top,

12:33.367 --> 12:35.122
I'm regretting that
I let you write the message

12:35.187 --> 12:36.434
from the aliens.

12:36.499 --> 12:38.747
"Dear, idiots of Earth!

12:38.812 --> 12:40.200
"You should not be transmitting!

12:40.265 --> 12:41.606
"We have a protocol to destroy

12:41.671 --> 12:43.286
"any and all life we discover!

12:43.351 --> 12:45.423
"You're lucky I got this
message and not my boss!

12:45.507 --> 12:46.958
"He's a real pain
in the glorg!

12:47.023 --> 12:48.751
"Anyway,
I have to tell him about this.

12:48.859 --> 12:50.755
"Maybe he won't want
to destroy your planet!

12:50.820 --> 12:52.606
"I'll let you know
tomorrow! In the meantime,

12:52.671 --> 12:54.114
do not transmit
any more signals!"

12:54.179 --> 12:56.552
- Holy crap, Susmita!
- Oh, my God!

12:56.617 --> 12:59.447
Our Science Fair project might
have just destroyed Earth!

13:01.988 --> 13:04.987
What are they freaking
out about? Oh, yeah.

13:10.483 --> 13:11.973
The aliens might destroy Earth!

13:12.038 --> 13:13.833
I know! This sucks.

13:13.898 --> 13:15.747
What do we do? What do we do?

13:15.812 --> 13:17.161
- Susmita.
- Yeah?

13:17.226 --> 13:18.966
This might be our last day on Earth.

13:19.033 --> 13:20.587
If there's anything
we want to do,

13:20.679 --> 13:21.923
I guess we should go do it.

13:22.968 --> 13:24.093
Move! Out of the way!

13:24.158 --> 13:25.579
Hey, Tina...

13:29.038 --> 13:30.265
Whoa.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.543
Ugh, why is your face
so wet?

13:33.546 --> 13:36.677
Dang, Tina! I must be
a giant whoopee cushion,

13:36.742 --> 13:38.200
'cause you just knocked
a fart out of me!

13:38.265 --> 13:39.263
Aw, screw it.

13:39.330 --> 13:41.001
Mm, mwah.

13:41.273 --> 13:43.868
Holy do-what-in-the-huh?

13:45.393 --> 13:47.256
Hi, kids. How was your day?

13:47.343 --> 13:49.557
I love you so much, Mom.

13:49.624 --> 13:51.880
I love you, too, sweetie.

13:51.945 --> 13:54.106
Dad, have you told Mom how
much you love her today?

13:54.171 --> 13:56.666
Um, I-I think... maybe?

13:56.733 --> 13:59.157
- Tell her, damn it!
- I-I love you, Lin.

13:59.226 --> 14:01.386
- Wait, what's happening?
- Everything's fine.

14:01.453 --> 14:02.899
Life is just so damn beautiful.

14:03.007 --> 14:04.886
- Thank you.
- I freakin' love you, Gene.

14:04.953 --> 14:06.873
- I, uh, love...
- I love you, too, Louise.

14:06.940 --> 14:08.163
Yep, yep, that's good.

14:08.230 --> 14:10.556
Aw, my Teeny
Tina's emotional.

14:10.623 --> 14:13.186
What about this
coat-rack? Is it beautiful?

14:13.253 --> 14:15.528
No, it's weird. You
shouldn't have bought it.

14:15.593 --> 14:16.856
- He bought five.
- I know.

14:16.921 --> 14:18.880
That was really dumb,
Dad. But I love you.

14:18.945 --> 14:21.595
You're dumb.
I mean, I-I love you, too.

14:22.437 --> 14:24.106
So, what did you do
after school yesterday?

14:24.171 --> 14:26.067
I did some, um, kissing.

14:26.132 --> 14:27.825
Well, because of your advice,

14:27.890 --> 14:31.028
I, uh, wrote a note to
the boy I have a crush on.

14:31.093 --> 14:33.243
Attagirl. Did he write
back? What did he say?

14:33.351 --> 14:34.934
I didn't give it to him.

14:34.999 --> 14:37.294
Damn, Susmita.
The world's maybe about to end,

14:37.359 --> 14:38.755
and you're sitting on
an unsent love note?

14:38.820 --> 14:40.903
Funny advice considering
how we got here,

14:40.968 --> 14:43.325
Miss Greetings From
Earth Please Come Kill Us.

14:43.390 --> 14:44.588
Oh, my God.

14:44.655 --> 14:47.454
This is it. It's going
through the translator.

14:47.578 --> 14:49.198
"Dear Earth idiots!

14:49.293 --> 14:51.059
"I was gonna tell my
boss about your message.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.571
"But he was in what I guess
you call 'the bathroom.'

14:53.671 --> 14:56.603
"Anyway, he took forever,
and then my shift was over.

14:56.749 --> 14:59.348
So, you guys got lucky.
I didn't tell him."

14:59.413 --> 15:00.661
- He didn't tell him!
- Oh!

15:00.726 --> 15:02.091
"But if you ever send
another message,

15:02.156 --> 15:03.333
"your planet will be
destroyed.

15:03.398 --> 15:05.712
So do not ever send
another message!"

15:05.788 --> 15:07.470
Oh, thank God.

15:07.562 --> 15:10.188
Okay. Phew. Um, so should
we write back and say thanks?

15:10.312 --> 15:12.145
- Tina, no!
- Right, right, right.

15:12.210 --> 15:13.528
All right, this could work.

15:13.593 --> 15:14.919
Why? Why is this gonna work?

15:14.984 --> 15:16.520
People like sidewalk sales?

15:16.585 --> 15:18.950
Hey, Bob! Hey, uh,
what-what are you doing?

15:19.015 --> 15:21.005
Something stupid,
I'll bet! Zoom!

15:21.070 --> 15:24.466
We're having a sidewalk
mini coat-rack super sale.

15:24.533 --> 15:26.806
Coat-racks? Why would
anyone need coat-racks?

15:26.873 --> 15:28.380
They're for putting coats on.

15:28.445 --> 15:30.226
People need coat-racks,
Jimmy!

15:30.293 --> 15:33.227
That's dumb! You just hang your
coat on the back of your chair.

15:33.292 --> 15:34.335
You're dumb!

15:34.413 --> 15:37.231
Oh, put a fettuccine in
your in-betweeny, Jimmy!

15:37.296 --> 15:40.035
Ah, criminy sliminy,
I'm going inside.

15:40.963 --> 15:43.110
It seems like
we scared them straight.

15:43.179 --> 15:45.216
Give us the damn gift card,
Habes.

15:45.281 --> 15:47.630
Thanks to your help, I think
we broke your sister's spirits

15:47.695 --> 15:50.983
and put a lid on her reckless
sense of optimism for a while.

15:51.078 --> 15:52.337
Here you go.

15:52.780 --> 15:55.802
I feel really
good about this.

15:55.867 --> 15:58.251
Yeah, what does it matter
what Tina thinks of us?

15:58.382 --> 16:01.032
We're gonna be eating
free frozen yogurt!

16:01.281 --> 16:02.434
I feel terrible.

16:02.499 --> 16:03.937
Yeah...

16:04.015 --> 16:06.630
That sneaky alien faker
son of a bitch!

16:06.695 --> 16:09.218
And you guys, too! I-I can't
believe you helped him! Ugh!

16:09.283 --> 16:10.708
I know! We're sorry!

16:10.773 --> 16:13.098
And that's why we bought
you this gift card.

16:13.163 --> 16:15.005
- With our own money.
- Thank you.

16:15.070 --> 16:16.509
- It's a good start.
- Yeah.

16:16.578 --> 16:18.247
Wait, Susmita,
you know what this means?

16:18.312 --> 16:19.638
Now we can do
our science project.

16:19.703 --> 16:21.747
- Like, really do it.
- What do you mean?

16:21.812 --> 16:24.075
We can fix our satellite
and resend our message

16:24.140 --> 16:26.353
- to actual aliens.
- I don't know, Tina.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.091
What?
What do you mean you don't know?

16:28.156 --> 16:29.856
I mean,
I'm mad at Henry,

16:29.921 --> 16:31.450
and he shouldn't have
messed with our project.

16:31.515 --> 16:33.184
But maybe he's right.
It's too risky

16:33.249 --> 16:35.497
- to send out a message.
- Of course you'd say that.

16:35.562 --> 16:37.075
You couldn't even give
a love note to a boy

16:37.140 --> 16:38.520
when you thought it was
your last day on Earth.

16:38.585 --> 16:40.556
Ugh! I never should have
told you that.

16:40.640 --> 16:43.395
Have you even started working
on our Science Fair board yet?

16:43.460 --> 16:45.973
- Don't change the subject.
- The Science Fair is today!

16:46.038 --> 16:47.981
That's literally the subject!

16:48.046 --> 16:50.325
Look, I need to go
type up our conclusion.

16:50.390 --> 16:51.551
We don't have a conclusion.

16:51.616 --> 16:54.083
Our conclusion is that
there is no logical reason

16:54.148 --> 16:56.880
to attempt to make contact
with extraterrestrials.

16:56.945 --> 16:58.888
Damn it, Susmita!
You sound just like Henry!

16:58.953 --> 17:01.239
Well, at least we can
still get an "A," Tina.

17:01.304 --> 17:02.368
Screw the "A"!

17:02.687 --> 17:03.794
Yeah, you know what?

17:03.859 --> 17:05.801
I don't think we should be
Science Fair partners anymore.

17:05.867 --> 17:08.934
Well, I'm still turning in
the radio telescope project.

17:08.999 --> 17:10.281
What are you turning in?

17:10.348 --> 17:11.973
Uh, how 'bout
a little project called

17:12.038 --> 17:13.380
"Peanut Butter:
What's Up with That?"

17:13.444 --> 17:14.747
I still have time. Kind of.

17:14.811 --> 17:15.848
We'll help you, T.

17:15.913 --> 17:17.906
Well, good luck
with your peanut butter!

17:17.973 --> 17:19.053
Good luck with your...

17:19.119 --> 17:21.200
never taking chances in life!

17:21.265 --> 17:22.522
See you at the Science Fair!

17:22.589 --> 17:24.933
Oh, I-it's in the,
uh, auditorium, right?

17:25.000 --> 17:26.954
- Yeah.
- That's what I thought.

17:30.639 --> 17:33.936
Up... with... that?

17:34.093 --> 17:37.128
Okay, Hildy in the cafeteria
didn't have any peanuts,

17:37.193 --> 17:39.171
but she let us take a
few handfuls of almonds.

17:39.263 --> 17:41.132
Not all of mine
made it back.

17:41.216 --> 17:42.768
Thanks. I guess
almonds will have to do.

17:42.833 --> 17:44.843
Okay, we have two hours
until the Science Fair.

17:44.935 --> 17:46.585
It's time to see if you
can make peanut butter

17:46.650 --> 17:48.889
- without using any butter.
- Or peanuts.

17:49.043 --> 17:50.713
It's starting to rain a little.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.245
I'm shutting down the super sidewalk

17:52.310 --> 17:53.878
mini coat-rack full-price sale.

17:53.943 --> 17:55.099
How many did you sell?

17:55.176 --> 17:56.513
Lin, you know
I didn't sell any.

17:56.580 --> 17:58.736
Hey, look at
these little coat-racks.

17:58.803 --> 18:01.361
- Aren't these fun?
- This one looks like a little tree.

18:01.426 --> 18:03.002
That's funny. Trees are funny.

18:03.067 --> 18:04.955
Um, do-do you want to buy it?

18:05.020 --> 18:06.314
Why would I buy it?

18:06.379 --> 18:08.306
I'm just gonna put my coat on it,
right?

18:08.371 --> 18:10.244
Aw, people are using 'em.

18:10.309 --> 18:11.736
Because people need coat-racks.

18:11.801 --> 18:13.150
This is what I've been saying!

18:13.215 --> 18:14.728
Hey, wait, those people with coats

18:14.793 --> 18:16.033
are going into Jimmy Pesto's.

18:16.100 --> 18:17.884
Hey! He doesn't have coat-racks!

18:17.949 --> 18:19.564
Pesto's doesn't have
coat-racks!

18:19.629 --> 18:22.756
He-he wants you to put your wet
coats on the back of your chair!

18:22.823 --> 18:25.642
What? What? No, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey! That's not true!

18:25.710 --> 18:28.677
- Yes, it is! Come over here to Bob's Burgers!
- It's no... No!

18:28.742 --> 18:30.098
- We have coat-racks!
- No! No!

18:30.163 --> 18:32.106
- No!
- Yes! Yes!

18:32.173 --> 18:34.129
We win! Sort of.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.436
Oh, Bobby! Mwah, mwah!

18:36.503 --> 18:38.298
Now lift me up like
in The Notebook!

18:39.763 --> 18:40.968
I can't.

18:41.398 --> 18:44.434
And that's why we
shouldn't attempt to make contact

18:44.499 --> 18:45.668
with extraterrestrials.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.212
That's exactly right.

18:47.549 --> 18:49.677
Oh. Hi, Tina.

18:49.742 --> 18:52.773
Uh, so I guess you and Susmita
aren't partners anymore?

18:52.840 --> 18:55.273
We, uh, had some
scientific disagreements.

18:55.340 --> 18:57.836
- Well, you're up.
- So,

18:57.903 --> 18:59.756
I started with some almonds.

18:59.823 --> 19:00.966
Your board says "peanuts."

19:01.033 --> 19:03.044
Which are harder to
find than you may think.

19:03.109 --> 19:06.067
Um, so,
after crushing these almonds,

19:06.132 --> 19:07.585
they were transformed into a powder.

19:07.650 --> 19:10.186
- She's nailing this.
- Really strong start.

19:10.253 --> 19:13.915
Um, and, honestly, I wish I was
still doing my other project,

19:14.023 --> 19:15.648
but we came to two
different conclusions.

19:15.718 --> 19:18.134
She thought it was logical
to never reach out to aliens,

19:18.218 --> 19:19.646
but I think it's only logical

19:19.713 --> 19:21.055
that we need
to reach out to them.

19:21.120 --> 19:22.309
- Wrong.
- Shh!

19:22.374 --> 19:23.736
And why is that, Tina?

19:23.803 --> 19:25.403
Well, if we never reach out...

19:25.468 --> 19:27.380
Uh, j-just look at all
these other projects!

19:27.445 --> 19:29.044
I mean, first off, amazing boards.

19:29.109 --> 19:31.434
Great job, everybody. Seems like
a lot of parents got involved,

19:31.499 --> 19:33.208
but no judgment. But
look at... look at Zeke

19:33.273 --> 19:34.735
and Tammy's board.
The bees are dying.

19:34.800 --> 19:35.864
Preach, girl!

19:35.929 --> 19:36.888
Sea levels are rising.

19:36.953 --> 19:38.388
She's talking about our board.

19:38.453 --> 19:39.506
No, Jocelyn.

19:39.573 --> 19:41.716
- We did the life of the sun.
- Oh.

19:41.783 --> 19:44.243
Right. But what happens
when the sun burns out?

19:44.310 --> 19:45.458
Spray tan, I guess?

19:45.523 --> 19:48.145
A-And, uh, look at this
one. Overpopulation.

19:48.210 --> 19:50.415
We're burning through
natural resources like crazy.

19:50.515 --> 19:53.266
Wow, the Science Fair is
a real downer this year.

19:53.333 --> 19:56.821
So, yeah, if-if we make contact
with aliens, they might kill us.

19:56.890 --> 19:59.192
But what if we reach out
and the aliens help us?

19:59.257 --> 20:01.942
They could act in alien
movies. That'd be cool.

20:02.007 --> 20:04.489
The thing you're afraid of could
be our only chance at survival.

20:04.554 --> 20:06.294
In conclusion,
if we open ourselves up,

20:06.359 --> 20:07.403
yes, we might get hurt.

20:07.468 --> 20:09.034
But if we don't open ourselves up,

20:09.099 --> 20:11.042
- we die alone.
- Oh, my God.

20:11.109 --> 20:13.431
Did she just
change my mind?

20:17.360 --> 20:18.668
Good job, partner.

20:18.733 --> 20:21.145
Now, I've got to go make contact

20:21.210 --> 20:22.794
with a boy
I have a crush on.

20:22.859 --> 20:24.540
- The one you wrote that note to?
- Yeah.

20:24.617 --> 20:25.782
Get it, girl.

20:26.117 --> 20:27.910
- Henry?
- Uh, yes, Susmita?

20:28.062 --> 20:29.770
I've got a message for you.

20:29.835 --> 20:33.536
Doo-doo. Doo. Doo-doo.
Doo. Doo-doo-doo. Doo. Doo.

20:33.601 --> 20:34.873
Oh, wow. Okay.

20:34.940 --> 20:36.786
I mean, 100%.

20:36.851 --> 20:39.544
Doo. Doo-doo-doo.
Doo. Doo. Doo-doo...

20:39.609 --> 20:42.798
I ho... I hope the aliens
destroy Earth right now.

20:42.890 --> 20:45.145
It was Henry?
You got to be beeping kidding me.

20:45.210 --> 20:48.145
Hey, Tina! I can't wait till
the next last day on Earth!

20:48.210 --> 20:49.802
I'm excited for
that apocalypse!

20:49.867 --> 20:52.075
You know what I'm sayin'.
The apoca-lips.

20:52.140 --> 20:53.880
Zeke, what-what are you
talking about?

20:53.945 --> 20:55.895
What? Uh, nothing.
Uh, come on.

20:55.960 --> 20:57.200
Come on, I'm gonna get ya.
Ow, Zeke. Ow

20:57.265 --> 20:58.938
- Come on, come on.
- Aah, Zeke!
