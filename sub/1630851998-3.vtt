00:07.641 --> 00:09.443
- Previously on
"Mayor of Kingstown".

00:09.443 --> 00:11.812
- There's not one reason
for you to take this on.

00:11.812 --> 00:13.814
- Just tyin' up some loose ends.

00:17.185 --> 00:18.686
- Move some chess pieces around,

00:18.686 --> 00:20.188
the Crips might leave the yard.

00:20.188 --> 00:22.156
- Mitch wouldn't do it that way
Mike, it's a big risk.

00:22.156 --> 00:24.092
- Every once in a while
it's nice to remind them

00:24.092 --> 00:26.860
they're the prisoners, not us.

00:29.097 --> 00:31.499
They want their boy,
give him back.

00:31.499 --> 00:32.666
You get the yard back.

00:32.666 --> 00:33.934
- Where you at?
You a friend of me?

00:33.934 --> 00:35.269
Or you a friend of them?

00:35.269 --> 00:37.605
- I can't change the way
things are done here.

00:37.605 --> 00:40.108
- Don't waste a moment of us.

00:40.108 --> 00:42.143
- Special Agent Aldrich,
this is Special Agent Perry.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.611
Do you mind if we have a chat?

00:43.611 --> 00:46.114
If you would be interested
in being a paid informant.

00:46.114 --> 00:48.048
- Yes! Give me the paper.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.650
- Now, what I would
like you to do--

00:49.650 --> 00:51.319
- Uh, look,
this is how it goes...

00:51.319 --> 00:54.188
You wanna know who's
running what, anytime, where?

00:54.188 --> 00:56.257
Come to me.

00:56.257 --> 00:59.593
I have broken many a law with
feds standing right next to me

00:59.593 --> 01:02.230
so if you're here for
some sort of civic clean-up,

01:02.230 --> 01:05.433
just know, you have a lot of
sweeping in your house too.

01:05.433 --> 01:06.334
Okay?

01:09.303 --> 01:12.606
- *

01:24.285 --> 01:25.653
- MALE SINGER:
* There's no time

01:25.653 --> 01:28.055
* For feeling inferior

01:29.890 --> 01:33.427
* Standin' in front
of my mirror *

01:33.427 --> 01:37.064
* Comb my hair
in a thousand ways *

01:38.799 --> 01:42.170
* But I came out
looking just the same *

01:42.170 --> 01:46.207
* Daddy said, Son,
you better see the world *

01:47.708 --> 01:51.111
* I wouldn't blame ya
if ya wanted to leave *

01:51.111 --> 01:55.048
* But remember one thing,
don't lose your head *

01:56.750 --> 02:00.188
* Do a woman
that'll spend your bread *

02:00.188 --> 02:02.156
* So I got out

02:02.156 --> 02:05.893
- *

02:15.703 --> 02:19.840
- * Paris was a place
you could hide away *

02:21.409 --> 02:24.011
* If you felt
you didn't fit in *

02:24.712 --> 02:26.214
* The French police

02:26.214 --> 02:28.949
* Wouldn't give me no peace

02:30.551 --> 02:33.987
* They claimed
I was a nasty person *

02:33.987 --> 02:38.826
* Devil on the left
been minding my own *

02:39.593 --> 02:42.730
* Was knocked down
by a human stampede *

02:42.730 --> 02:47.000
* Got a record for inciting
a peaceful riot *

02:48.536 --> 02:52.072
* When all I wanted
was a cup of tea *

02:52.072 --> 02:53.374
* I was accused

02:53.374 --> 02:57.044
- *

03:04.084 --> 03:08.256
* Down in Rome
I wasn't gettin' enough *

03:09.690 --> 03:12.460
* Of the things
that keep a young man alive *

03:13.060 --> 03:16.897
* My body stunk
but I kept my funk *

03:18.532 --> 03:21.269
* And I take my wine
in the rough *

03:22.503 --> 03:26.307
* Pass out on my back,
just laugh it up *

03:28.576 --> 03:32.045
* You didn't have to
come here anyway *

03:32.045 --> 03:36.116
* Remember, every picture
tells a story, don't it *

03:36.550 --> 03:39.520
* Every picture
tells a story, don't it *

03:39.520 --> 03:42.856

05:42.142 --> 05:44.845

- Hey, I'm here.
Where are you?

05:57.791 --> 05:59.393
- Hey.
- Hey, Mike.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.829
Kenny Miles listed on
the lease, you know him?

06:01.829 --> 06:03.163
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.265
- Did five,
possession with intent, meth?

06:05.265 --> 06:07.267
- Yeah, he was a cook.

06:07.267 --> 06:09.903
- Well, that ain't him.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.305
- Okay, well, who is it?

06:12.305 --> 06:15.175
- We're hopin' you'd know.

06:15.943 --> 06:18.278
- Hey, still lit over here.

06:18.812 --> 06:21.148
- MIKE: Jesus, it's a mess.

06:25.285 --> 06:28.489
- Oh fuck, fuck!

06:28.489 --> 06:30.223
- What?
- What is it?

06:30.223 --> 06:31.725
- KYLE: Motherfucker.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.961
- What is it?

06:39.667 --> 06:41.201
Jesus...

06:42.736 --> 06:45.005
- Jesus Christ...

07:01.321 --> 07:04.458
- Okay, just let me know
if something turns up.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.326
'Kay.
- Police chief's here.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.261
- Yeah, I saw him.

07:08.261 --> 07:11.031
- You gonna take off?

07:11.031 --> 07:13.333
- No.

07:15.402 --> 07:16.737
- You got the call on this?

07:16.737 --> 07:17.905
- Yes sir.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.239
- Partner's off?
- Mm-hmm.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.008
- You want it?
I need this seen through.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.776
So, if you're gonna run off
to the troopers in three weeks,

07:22.776 --> 07:24.411
I'd rather have someone else.

07:24.411 --> 07:27.114
- I'm not goin' anywhere Chief.
- Good.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.381
- All right,
Ian takes lead, you're second.

07:28.381 --> 07:31.885
Jimmy can assist when he
comes on tomorrow, yeah?

07:32.753 --> 07:34.688
- Hello, Mike.

07:34.688 --> 07:36.824
- Trent.

07:36.824 --> 07:39.192
- Got anything new?
- Yeah, Kenny was

07:39.192 --> 07:41.461
seen around town with his
ex-wife last couple weeks.

07:41.461 --> 07:45.533
They were divorced in 2011,
she got a 5 year-old kid,

07:45.533 --> 07:48.035
we don't know who the
father was, but it's not Kenny.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.771
She was in Ohio
up until a couple months ago.

07:50.771 --> 07:53.006
- How do you know this?

07:57.277 --> 08:00.313
- All right.
I'm gonna step away.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.584
Clean, gentlemen.
This is a capital case.

08:03.584 --> 08:06.253
I don't wanna give this
piece of shit any daylight.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.156
Put him on the payroll as a CI.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.290
'Cause I don't know
how to explain

08:10.290 --> 08:12.292
what the fuck
he does for a living.

08:12.292 --> 08:15.328
- You got it chief, it's okay.
- All right.

08:17.931 --> 08:20.768
- Or better yet, this maggot
doesn't make it to court.

08:20.768 --> 08:22.703
Hmm?
He's a fucking child murderer.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.137
- Well, you can just
put him in county.

08:24.137 --> 08:27.107
He'll never see his arraignment.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.713
- Can you be certain?

08:32.713 --> 08:34.481
- Uh, do you really
want me to be?

08:34.481 --> 08:36.984
- If he goes to county,
will he see his arraignment?

08:36.984 --> 08:38.752
- Hey, no, come on, look.
It's not that simple.

08:38.752 --> 08:40.788
- But what?
You got a better way to do this?

08:40.788 --> 08:44.157
This piece of shit lounges on
fucking death row watching cable

08:44.157 --> 08:46.760
while my tax dollars pay for a
decade of appeals? Fuck that.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.329
- If it was up to me, we'd get
a tall tree and a short rope.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.632
- At least it's none of my guys
takin' the rap.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.266
Gonna be a lotta
hotheads tonight.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.836
- [chuckles] You guys,
do you know what you're asking?

08:55.836 --> 08:58.238
- I'm not asking anything.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.273
You are.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.344
- Ian.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.979
- I mean, fuck him, Mike.
What better way?

09:05.979 --> 09:07.915
- Hey come on,
this is a deal with the devil.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.783
And you know it.
I mean, have fuckin' Robert

09:09.783 --> 09:11.919
shoot the fucker
when they serve his warrant.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.386
Right? Ian?

09:13.386 --> 09:15.122
- But what if, Mike?

09:15.122 --> 09:18.592
I mean, what if we can't
make it work out that way?

09:18.592 --> 09:20.594
Stevie, let's go.

09:20.594 --> 09:23.396
- Are you...

09:39.546 --> 09:41.749
- Hey um, can I see him?

09:41.749 --> 09:44.785
- What for?

09:44.785 --> 09:47.220
- Motivation.

09:50.057 --> 09:52.626
- [zipper unzipping]

09:57.497 --> 09:59.299
- Oh my God...

09:59.299 --> 10:00.834
- You see the things I seen,

10:00.834 --> 10:02.736
you realize people are fragile.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.304
Like eggs.

10:04.304 --> 10:07.174
- I don't know how you do it.
Jesus.

10:07.174 --> 10:10.277
- Well, when you pick someone up
who's ready, it's not so bad.

10:10.277 --> 10:14.848
More times than not,
there's a hint of a smile.

10:14.848 --> 10:17.284
- He look ready to you?

10:17.284 --> 10:21.221
- Young ones never look ready.

10:22.890 --> 10:25.558
- Alright, thanks.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.695
Okay, let's get this started.
- Already have.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.797
We set up DUI roadblocks.
- Where?

10:29.797 --> 10:32.232
- Fuckin' everywhere.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.101
- Good.

10:35.703 --> 10:39.206
- *

11:01.294 --> 11:04.397
- *

11:33.393 --> 11:37.664
- Okay, we're set at the house
on Woodmore and 134th St.

11:37.664 --> 11:40.267
- All right. Let us know
what you turn up, huh.

11:40.267 --> 11:41.501
- Hey Mike,
watch commander wants to know

11:41.501 --> 11:42.936
if you can back-date
your CI letter,

11:42.936 --> 11:44.137
he'll sign it for ya.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.638
- I'm an FBI informant
for fuck sake.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.640
- I don't make the rules Mike.
- It should be enough right?

11:47.640 --> 11:49.476
- Hey Stevie, you rollin'
with us on this one or what?

11:49.476 --> 11:50.844
- You turnin' the beast loose?
- Yeah.

11:50.844 --> 11:51.879
- Wouldn't miss it for the
world.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.747
- All right.

11:53.747 --> 11:56.116
- Speak of the devil.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.155
- There he is.

12:04.591 --> 12:05.993
- What's the deal?

12:05.993 --> 12:07.494
- All right,
we got your team ready to go,

12:07.494 --> 12:09.496
team two's serving warrants
at Spivey's.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.999
- So why didn't I just
fuckin' meet you there?

12:11.999 --> 12:14.101
- We just wanna
talk to you a second.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.702
- So talk.

12:15.702 --> 12:17.704
- Everything we do
is off the reservation.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.339
- Yeah.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.109
- So, what would you say
if I asked you to

12:22.109 --> 12:24.511
treat this like Afghanistan?

12:24.511 --> 12:26.079
- Well, you know me
better than that, Ian.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.081
The answer is yes.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.851
The fuck?
- That's right, fuck.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.986
- All right.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.487
- Let us know
what you find out, okay?

12:34.487 --> 12:36.723
- Yeah, get him. Be safe, okay?
- Yeah, yeah, got it, Mike.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.258
- Be safe.
- I got it.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.862
- [engines starting]

12:52.372 --> 12:54.041
- [line trills]
- Hey man.

12:54.041 --> 12:56.476
- Bunny, need to talk.
In an hour?

12:56.476 --> 12:57.811
I just gotta do something first.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.312
- Aight man.

13:03.616 --> 13:07.687
- *

13:29.877 --> 13:31.444
- *

13:35.482 --> 13:37.784
- [door breaking]

13:37.784 --> 13:40.220
- [audio slowed]
Police!

13:43.423 --> 13:45.458
- [indistinct shouting]

13:46.693 --> 13:48.395
- Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

13:48.395 --> 13:52.065
Okay, I'ma okay, get off,
you're gonna rip it man.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.666
You're fucking taking it, off.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.203
Get the fuck off.

13:56.203 --> 13:57.837
I know exactly what I'm doing
with the city's money

13:57.837 --> 14:00.740
from my fucking lawsuit.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.809
[coughing]
Can't do that...

14:02.809 --> 14:04.011
- [laughing]
- Goes like this,

14:04.011 --> 14:05.678
possession of
a controlled substance

14:05.678 --> 14:08.348
with intent to distribute,
that's ten.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.450
Resisting arrest, another two.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.020
Felon in possession of a fucking
firearm, Spivey, that's,

14:13.020 --> 14:14.521
that's ten more, buddy.

14:14.521 --> 14:15.755
- Tell us where Kenny would go,

14:15.755 --> 14:17.390
maybe two of those
don't make the report.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.592
- We're not huntin' you, Spive.

14:19.592 --> 14:22.162
But make no mistake,
we are huntin'.

14:22.162 --> 14:26.266
- Do I look like a fuckin' rat?

14:26.266 --> 14:28.868
Ugh, oh shit.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.637
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.072
- Just think this through.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.907
Spive, you can sleep it off,
right here, right now.

14:33.907 --> 14:36.109
Or, you're gonna
go down the street for 20 years

14:36.109 --> 14:39.646
protecting a guy who just cooked
a five year-old kid

14:39.646 --> 14:42.882
and his mother alive.
Be smart.

14:42.882 --> 14:46.219
- Oh, good cop, bad cop, huh?

14:47.754 --> 14:50.157
- There are no good cops today,
boy.

14:51.658 --> 14:52.960
- Alright, just me and you.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.694
- You tell him,
you tell everybody.

14:54.694 --> 14:57.264
- He's a McLusky, I tell him.

15:10.843 --> 15:12.612
- Hey.
- I gotta pat you down.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.814
- Yeah.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.887
- Over here.

15:36.269 --> 15:39.506
- Duke.
- Mike.

15:39.506 --> 15:42.175
Let's walk.
- Yeah.

15:45.412 --> 15:49.416
- That's terrible.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:49.416 --> 15:52.019
- He's not ours, not now.
You can have him.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.886
- I'm gonna need more.

15:53.886 --> 15:55.822
Can ya take him back?

15:55.822 --> 15:59.759
Let him feel safe, pin him down?

15:59.759 --> 16:01.728
Look, you ain't gonna be no rat,
right?

16:01.728 --> 16:04.664
Kenny's poison at this point.

16:04.664 --> 16:07.134
- Got kids of my own.

16:07.134 --> 16:10.837
One in college,
if you believe it.

16:10.837 --> 16:12.905
The enemy of my enemy
isn't my friend,

16:12.905 --> 16:15.975
he's just another fucker
I gotta worry about.

16:15.975 --> 16:19.112
- Yeah, they're gonna
look the other way, Pete.

16:19.112 --> 16:21.081
You run a tight ship.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.615
Everything you make
goes somewhere else,

16:22.615 --> 16:25.052
all the boys
keep their heads down.

16:25.052 --> 16:27.554
You can do really good on this.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.989
Do really good.

16:29.989 --> 16:33.660
- You called me Pete.
- Oh, yeah.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.463
I remember when you were Petey.

16:36.463 --> 16:39.732
- Yeah, now we're here.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.434
- Look, when they get him,

16:41.434 --> 16:44.504
I think they'll
probably put him in county

16:44.504 --> 16:45.972
to wait for his arraignment.

16:45.972 --> 16:47.974
- Public defender will
have him in protective custody

16:47.974 --> 16:49.509
before he leaves holding.

16:49.509 --> 16:53.480
- I see the wheels turnin'.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.849
- They want him finished
before the arraignment, huh?

16:56.849 --> 17:01.054
- I don't know.
I didn't...

17:01.054 --> 17:03.056
- What do you want?

17:05.092 --> 17:07.560
- Fuck me.
I'm...

17:09.296 --> 17:11.098
I saw that boy.

17:13.266 --> 17:17.304
His scream's burnt into
his fucking face, man.

17:18.671 --> 17:22.909
So...
they want him bad.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.911
They'll agree to anything.

17:24.911 --> 17:27.046
In a few months,
they'll regret it.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.215
Wanna take it back.

17:28.215 --> 17:29.616
- It's not the way things work.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.351
- Yeah, shit.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.653
They want it.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.888
- It's gotta be everybody.

17:35.888 --> 17:39.192
Blacks, Mexicans.
Everybody...

17:39.192 --> 17:42.829
It's a deal
with the devil, brother.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.597
My advice?
Shoot the prick, plant a knife.

17:44.597 --> 17:45.798
Be done with it.

17:45.798 --> 17:49.302
- 100%, agreed.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.304
But what if they go another way?

17:53.440 --> 17:55.508
- You get me the blacks?

17:55.508 --> 17:58.111
- I can get everybody.

17:58.111 --> 18:00.046
- These fuckers know
what it'll cost?

18:00.046 --> 18:03.516
- They have no idea.

18:04.851 --> 18:08.388
- If he comes my way,
I'll let you know.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.190
- Yeah, thanks.

18:11.057 --> 18:14.261
- Mike, they should kill him
where they find him.

18:14.261 --> 18:15.928
Much as I'd love free reign,

18:15.928 --> 18:18.231
we all know
this won't be free for anybody.

18:18.231 --> 18:20.567
- Yeah, but you'll do it.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.639
- How could I pass it up?

18:26.639 --> 18:29.041
- Yep...

18:30.677 --> 18:35.382
- *

18:43.223 --> 18:45.992
- *

19:24.063 --> 19:26.999
- The first African slave
was a king.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.602
He was abducted
off the coast of East Africa

19:29.602 --> 19:33.440
by a Portuguese explorer.

19:33.440 --> 19:37.844
This king pleaded. He bargained.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.513
He promised that
if he were returned

19:40.513 --> 19:43.483
the following year
he would provide ten people

19:43.483 --> 19:48.521
in exchange for his freedom.
He was released.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.324
The following year
the same explorer

19:51.324 --> 19:55.428
landed in the same area,
and ten people

19:55.428 --> 20:00.032
were led to the shore
and presented to him.

20:00.032 --> 20:03.270
The next year, over 100 slaves

20:03.270 --> 20:06.273
were returned to Europe.

20:06.273 --> 20:09.342
And the next year,
they wanted more.

20:09.342 --> 20:12.645
And the next year.
And the next year.

20:12.645 --> 20:15.315
And the next year.

20:15.315 --> 20:20.086
It is said that you could walk
from Africa to America

20:20.086 --> 20:23.423
on the backs
of her stolen children

20:23.423 --> 20:27.126
and never would a boot get wet.

20:27.126 --> 20:30.997
Would slavery have existed
without this bargain?

20:30.997 --> 20:33.800
Perhaps the question should be,

20:33.800 --> 20:36.469
would the bargain have existed

20:36.469 --> 20:40.106
without the desire for a slave?

20:49.982 --> 20:52.084
- [line trilling]

20:52.084 --> 20:54.487
- Hey, how'd it go?
- KYLE: Eh, Spivey says

20:54.487 --> 20:56.989
he's been sellin' to
some Indians over on Coolidge.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.325
- Ah, he's never
gonna go to them.

20:58.325 --> 20:59.959
- Yeah, I know.
- They're work a shake though,

20:59.959 --> 21:01.193
somebody owes him something.

21:01.193 --> 21:02.295
A friend, a relative,
just keep pressing.

21:02.295 --> 21:03.663
- You hear anything,
let us know.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.632
- Yeah, you too.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.837
- *

21:18.678 --> 21:21.514
- Yeah, yeah.

21:23.182 --> 21:25.585
See what we got here.
We got it.

21:25.585 --> 21:28.355
- [phone ringing]

21:30.357 --> 21:32.392
- Hey, you feel like uh, hookin'
a brother up

21:32.392 --> 21:34.761
with some White Castle
on your way over, man?

21:34.761 --> 21:37.129
I'm hungrier than a motherfucker
in this bitch, man.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.598
- Naw, I'm not comin' that way,
Bunny.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.533
- Ah, you huntin'
that meth head, right?

21:40.533 --> 21:41.801
- Yep.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.737
- Okay, well,
you need anything from me?

21:44.737 --> 21:46.238
- Not sure yet.

21:46.238 --> 21:47.974
- Aight, well, you lemme know
if I can help, man.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.842
I'm here all night.

22:07.026 --> 22:11.598
- [sobbing]

22:23.443 --> 22:26.913
I'm so fucking stupid,
so fucking...

22:33.420 --> 22:36.656
I'm so fucking stupid...

22:36.656 --> 22:38.257
So fucking stupid.

22:38.725 --> 22:40.693
So fucking stupid.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.962
Fucking stupid.

22:47.133 --> 22:49.235
Stupid...

23:03.916 --> 23:05.317
- [door opens]

23:06.719 --> 23:08.955
- Hey, Mike.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.960
Mike, hey.
- The fuck?

23:13.960 --> 23:17.063
What happened?
- Hey, coffee.

23:17.063 --> 23:19.331
- Yep.

23:19.331 --> 23:21.601
Fuck.

23:21.601 --> 23:24.771
- I'd offer to run to your place
and get you a fresh suit,

23:24.771 --> 23:27.974
but, you know.
You live in the woods somewhere.

23:27.974 --> 23:30.510
- Yeah, thank you.
It's okay.

23:30.510 --> 23:32.078
- People outside already.

23:32.078 --> 23:35.882
- Uh, can you um,
just give me like ten minutes.

23:35.882 --> 23:38.651
- I can give you two.
Waiting room's packed.

23:38.651 --> 23:40.887
You want some breakfast?

23:40.887 --> 23:44.023
- Cigarettes.

23:45.124 --> 23:46.593
- It was that bad, huh?

23:46.593 --> 23:48.761
- Yeah, yep.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.630
Just uh, will you
grab me a pack, would you?

23:50.630 --> 23:52.565
- Yeah.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.322
- [knock on door]

24:16.322 --> 24:19.225
- Fucking...
That was two minutes?

24:19.225 --> 24:22.228
- You ready?
- Yep, yeah...

24:22.228 --> 24:25.865
- Carlos Jimenez.
- Carlos.

24:30.770 --> 24:33.706
- You know my nephew.

24:33.706 --> 24:36.075
- Yeah, right.

24:36.075 --> 24:39.378
- SWAT killed him
for you last week.

24:39.846 --> 24:41.581
- Hmm.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.887
Yeah, he got off easy.

24:49.722 --> 24:53.225
- If you hadn't a done it,
I would've.

24:53.225 --> 24:57.163
We woulda done that for you.
He was a disappointment.

24:57.163 --> 25:01.067
No honor.
Not here about that though,

25:01.067 --> 25:03.570
just wanted to be
up front about it.

25:03.570 --> 25:08.007
- Yeah, well, we're not
coming after your people.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.341
I know it wasn't sanctioned.

25:09.341 --> 25:12.244
- We're good Mike,
I'm here about the tweaker

25:12.244 --> 25:15.548
who blew up
his old lady and kid.

25:15.548 --> 25:17.183
- Yeah, what about him?

25:17.183 --> 25:19.451
- Cooked for us some.
Got some money coming his way.

25:19.451 --> 25:20.653
He'll need it.

25:20.653 --> 25:23.189
5-0 is gonna come down hard
on everyone for this.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.191
Let 'em know
that if he comes for it,

25:25.191 --> 25:27.560
we'll put in the tip.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.095
- I'll let it be known.

25:29.095 --> 25:31.197
- We don't want to
be tied to this.

25:31.197 --> 25:34.133
Not how we conduct ourselves.
It's important people know that.

25:34.133 --> 25:37.770
- Yep, I get it. I understand.

25:38.504 --> 25:42.575
- I remember you from way back.
When you was inside.

25:42.575 --> 25:43.976
- Hmm...

25:43.976 --> 25:47.013
- B Yard. Shot callin'.

25:47.013 --> 25:50.917
- Yeah, it was a long time ago.

25:50.917 --> 25:55.888
- Yeah, it was different then.

25:55.888 --> 25:58.224
- Not really.

26:03.362 --> 26:05.598
- [door opens]
- See you around.

26:08.635 --> 26:12.605
- *

26:37.730 --> 26:40.232
- Um, Tracy.

26:40.232 --> 26:42.334
I'm so sorry to interrupt you,

26:42.334 --> 26:46.172
um, Kyle's bringing
Mike home for supper.

26:46.172 --> 26:48.775
- Kyle's bringing Mike?

26:48.775 --> 26:51.577
- Well, I told him to.

26:51.577 --> 26:52.912
- What are we making?

26:52.912 --> 26:55.514
- Oh, something festive.

26:55.514 --> 26:58.918
- Are you feeling festive?
- No, but...

26:58.918 --> 27:01.620
We'll make
something festive anyway.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.089
- Italian's festive.

27:03.089 --> 27:07.426
- Italian it is. Does he know?

27:07.426 --> 27:09.361
- Know what?

27:09.361 --> 27:12.832
- Nothing.
Nothing, I just...

27:12.832 --> 27:15.134
So, um,
I'll meet you at the car.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.169
Whenever you're ready.

27:23.342 --> 27:27.279
- *

27:40.326 --> 27:42.729
- Mike.
- Hello, Mike.

27:42.729 --> 27:44.430
- Hey.

27:45.631 --> 27:47.266
Uh, this feels official.

27:47.266 --> 27:50.169
- Heh, furthest thing from it.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.337
- Just wanna know
where we are, Mike.

27:51.337 --> 27:52.571
- You got everything set?

27:52.571 --> 27:54.073
- Why don't you guys
find the guy first

27:54.073 --> 27:55.341
and then we can
talk about it.

27:55.341 --> 27:56.642
- Mike, come on.
- For fuck sakes.

27:56.642 --> 27:58.044
The minute this piece of shit
gets booked,

27:58.044 --> 27:59.846
he's gonna be placed
in protective custody.

27:59.846 --> 28:02.314
- Yep, not a god damn thing
you can do about it.

28:02.314 --> 28:04.650
You know it.
Can't punch him to county.

28:04.650 --> 28:06.185
Sheriff's department,
the snitches.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.453
See, there's nothing but
blow back right there.

28:07.453 --> 28:09.188
- No, we got a better idea.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.222
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

28:10.222 --> 28:12.058
- He's on parole, Mike.

28:12.058 --> 28:14.393
Violation sends him
right back to the Mall.

28:16.395 --> 28:18.998
- You're outta your fucking
minds.

28:18.998 --> 28:20.332
You're fucking kidding me,

28:20.332 --> 28:22.334
you wanna put him
in the fucking penitentiary?

28:22.334 --> 28:24.937
There's no way, you gotta get
the guards, you gotta get--

28:24.937 --> 28:27.573
Just shoot the fucker in a raid.
Okay?

28:27.573 --> 28:29.776
'Cause you can't keep the deal,
you're gonna have to make.

28:29.776 --> 28:30.943
It's impossible.

28:30.943 --> 28:33.079
- Hey fellas, Mike.
- Aw, fucking Ed.

28:33.079 --> 28:34.814
You guys have been
planning this shit?

28:34.814 --> 28:36.015
What am I doing here?

28:36.015 --> 28:37.249
- Ed, how's everybody
feel about this?

28:37.249 --> 28:38.584
- We're great,
we're glad to be a part.

28:38.584 --> 28:40.486
Look, look, look,
he's not a snitch,

28:40.486 --> 28:43.389
hasn't backed out of his crew.
All right? You send him to us,

28:43.389 --> 28:45.257
and procedure dictates
that he goes to the main line.

28:45.257 --> 28:46.725
End of story.
- Mm-hmm.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.028
- There's nothing to manipulate.
- That's the way, Mike.

28:49.028 --> 28:51.197
- Look, why are you makin'
a big deal out of this, Mike?

28:51.197 --> 28:53.032
The whites will kill him
just to make a statement.

28:53.032 --> 28:55.034
All right?
No one has to do anything.

28:55.034 --> 28:58.404
- Look, the concern is that
his PD is gonna request AdSeg

28:58.404 --> 29:00.773
and the God damn DA's office
may do it themselves

29:00.773 --> 29:03.209
just to make sure that
they can fuckin' prosecute this.

29:03.209 --> 29:04.911
That's it.
- So, it needs to happen,

29:04.911 --> 29:06.212
the minute he steps inside.

29:06.212 --> 29:08.380
- Mike, Mike,
you gotta work some magic.

29:08.380 --> 29:09.949
He burned a fucking kid, Mike.

29:09.949 --> 29:11.350
- Tell me he don't
deserve it, Mike.

29:11.350 --> 29:12.384
We'll walk away.
- [group agreeing]

29:12.384 --> 29:13.719
- How can you not want this?

29:13.719 --> 29:16.255
- Come on, just fucking
put it together, Mike.

29:18.925 --> 29:20.659
- But at what cost?

29:23.029 --> 29:26.198
This shit ain't free, remember.

29:26.198 --> 29:28.200
You wanna be in business
with 2,000 criminals?

29:28.200 --> 29:29.301
Who will hold this
over your head

29:29.301 --> 29:31.838
like a motherfucking hammer?

29:31.838 --> 29:33.472
Every arrest you make,

29:33.472 --> 29:35.741
pedophile, murderer or gangster,

29:35.741 --> 29:38.210
this is what they'll sing.

29:38.210 --> 29:41.447
This is what they'll sing,
to anyone who'll listen.

29:41.447 --> 29:44.150
- No one's gonna listen.
- Nope.

29:44.150 --> 29:46.052
- Understand? Listen to me.

29:46.052 --> 29:51.423
Mike, I'm asking.
Okay?

29:56.095 --> 29:57.429
- Can you get him in the gym?

29:57.429 --> 30:00.900
- ED: I can put him
anywhere you want.

30:02.201 --> 30:03.903
- Then, all right.

30:05.437 --> 30:07.806
- Mike, don't feel bad
for this fucking scumbag.

30:07.806 --> 30:08.707
He's got it coming.

30:08.707 --> 30:10.009
- I don't fuckin'
feel bad for him.

30:10.009 --> 30:12.078
- Then what is it man?
'Cause how is this any different

30:12.078 --> 30:13.545
than poppin' that fuck
who killed Mitch?

30:13.545 --> 30:15.614
- 'Cause you don't understand.

30:15.614 --> 30:20.152
They're not doin' this
because it's noble, you guys.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.621
Their motivation
is so you owe them.

30:22.621 --> 30:25.557
You all owe them.

30:25.557 --> 30:27.159
And when you can't
pay them back,

30:27.159 --> 30:30.129
there's no more
thin blue line fellas.

30:30.129 --> 30:31.830
Understand?

30:31.830 --> 30:35.634
Yep, yep, yep. Okay.

30:37.803 --> 30:39.705
- Look, he's just fuckin'
lookin' out for us, that's all.

30:39.705 --> 30:41.307
- Yeah,
he's fuckin' wound tight.

30:41.307 --> 30:43.409
- Look fellas, trust me,
trust me, we all want this.

30:43.409 --> 30:45.344
And make no mistake,
it's our prison.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.413
- No shit.
- It's not theirs.

30:47.413 --> 30:49.615
It's not theirs.
- Mike's actually right...

30:49.615 --> 30:53.619
The thing is,
I just don't fucking care.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.625
- Hey Mike.
- Becca,

30:59.625 --> 31:02.929
I need the number to Carlos,
that guy I saw this morning.

31:02.929 --> 31:05.097
Can you text it to me?
- Yep.

31:05.097 --> 31:06.865
- Thanks.

31:09.401 --> 31:12.071
- [phone ringing]
- Yeah?

31:12.071 --> 31:13.405
- How do you like your burger?

31:13.405 --> 31:15.674
- Big as a motherfucker.

31:15.674 --> 31:17.409
But don't let them put
no pickles on my shit, man.

31:17.409 --> 31:18.810
I don't like that.

31:18.810 --> 31:21.780
- Okay, no pickles,
you want fries?

31:21.780 --> 31:24.183
- Why you bein' so good
to big daddy?

31:24.183 --> 31:28.654
Curly fries motherfucker.
Curly fries! Yeah.

31:39.831 --> 31:41.433
- Any chance he's in there?
- I doubt it,

31:41.433 --> 31:43.035
but he cooks for these guys.

31:43.035 --> 31:45.004
- More likely this is the step
to the step that locates him.

31:45.004 --> 31:46.805
- Oh, finally.
Kenny's fucking PO.

31:46.805 --> 31:49.275
- Who's lead on this?
- Me.

31:49.275 --> 31:53.179
- McLusky, figures.
Why am I here if Kenny isn't?

31:53.179 --> 31:55.781
- You kept a real tight leash
on your boy, huh.

31:55.781 --> 31:57.116
- What?

31:57.116 --> 31:58.550
- You ever bothered
goin' to his trailer?

31:58.550 --> 32:00.486
You know, the one with the
fucking meth lab in the kitchen?

32:00.486 --> 32:03.755
- You questioning the way
I do things, Irish? Huh?

32:03.755 --> 32:05.157
- You gotta be
fucking kidding me,

32:05.157 --> 32:06.892
you wanna make this racial,
brotha?

32:06.892 --> 32:09.261
Honestly?
- Call me brother, again!

32:09.261 --> 32:11.097
- How about you do
your fucking job,

32:11.097 --> 32:12.831
you sloppy motherfucker.

32:12.831 --> 32:15.434
Do your motherfucking job.

32:19.738 --> 32:21.040
- Fucking bitches...

32:21.040 --> 32:22.608
I will not have this shit
on a breach.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.876
You are both mine
until this is over

32:24.876 --> 32:28.714
and I will not fucking have it!
Back off.

32:28.714 --> 32:30.316
And you,
you been doin' this 20 years

32:30.316 --> 32:32.218
and this is how you act,
you fat fuck?

32:32.218 --> 32:34.320
You check that fucking swagger,
he found that kid

32:34.320 --> 32:36.188
and he peeled his mother
off a fucking couch.

32:36.188 --> 32:39.125
I don't give a shit how heavy
your case load is,

32:39.125 --> 32:43.195
this is your mess, and you will
suck on it in silence.

32:45.197 --> 32:48.634
- *

33:06.685 --> 33:07.853
- Fuck this, you're both out.

33:07.853 --> 33:09.255
Jimmy, you serve.
- Fuck!

33:09.255 --> 33:10.622
- Ian, Stevie follow the team.

33:10.622 --> 33:11.890
You stay here.
- Come on.

33:11.890 --> 33:14.660
- Get the fuck outta here
before I lose my temper.

33:14.660 --> 33:15.927
Come here.
- The fuck?

33:15.927 --> 33:18.464
- Come here, come here.
- What the fuck?

33:18.464 --> 33:20.932
- You're taking this shit
too personal.

33:20.932 --> 33:23.202
- How the fuck
am I supposed to take it?

33:23.202 --> 33:25.204
Come on.
- Hey, McLusky.

33:25.204 --> 33:27.039
- Let's get the fuck outta here
boys, come on, chop chop.

33:27.039 --> 33:29.308
- Shake it off,
it's never our fault.

33:29.308 --> 33:31.543
Remember that, never our fault.

33:33.045 --> 33:34.680
- Come on, big shooter.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.049
- Fuck off.
- Fuck you.

33:37.049 --> 33:39.618
You be cool.
- Yeah, yeah.

33:43.389 --> 33:45.824
- Fuck...
- You bunch of fucks.

33:45.824 --> 33:47.993
I was working now.
- Right here. Right here.

33:47.993 --> 33:50.629
- Great fucking job.
A+ hotshot.

33:50.629 --> 33:52.298
Son of a bitch.

34:22.794 --> 34:24.296
- Yeah, yeah.

34:24.296 --> 34:26.165
That's what I'm talkin' about,
right there.

34:26.165 --> 34:28.400
Hey, get up,

34:28.400 --> 34:32.003
Get yo ass up,
I ain't gonna say it again.

34:33.405 --> 34:34.906
What's good baby?

34:34.906 --> 34:36.908
- That's good.

34:36.908 --> 34:40.346
- [Bunny chuckles]

34:41.547 --> 34:43.982
- Ah.
- Yeah.

34:45.317 --> 34:47.052
- Five-O all worked up
over this burnin', huh?

34:47.052 --> 34:50.021
- Oh yeah, yep.

34:50.021 --> 34:51.290
- They ain't never
have this fever

34:51.290 --> 34:53.692
when it's a little brother
they find dead.

34:53.692 --> 34:56.695
Even though that little cracker
grew up around all that meth.

34:56.695 --> 34:59.931
Ho ass mama, fuck-up old man...

34:59.931 --> 35:01.066
Them cops still think that boy

35:01.066 --> 35:03.269
coulda made something
of his life.

35:03.269 --> 35:05.604
They find a little brother dead?

35:05.604 --> 35:07.139
They just shake their head
'cause they know

35:07.139 --> 35:10.242
he aint got no chance.

35:10.242 --> 35:11.410
- I think you're reading

35:11.410 --> 35:13.579
a little too much
into that, brother.

35:13.579 --> 35:15.281
A five-year-old
is a five-year-old.

35:15.281 --> 35:18.116
- I don't read at all.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.785
I see what I see.

35:19.785 --> 35:21.553
- Yeah.

35:21.553 --> 35:22.721
All right, look.

35:22.721 --> 35:24.990
So, when they catch him,
they're gonna violate him

35:24.990 --> 35:26.992
and put him right to pen.

35:26.992 --> 35:29.328
- Stick his ass in AdSeg, man.
Keep him safe.

35:29.328 --> 35:31.530
- They're gonna put him
in the gym.

35:31.530 --> 35:34.700
- Then they pin the murder
on some fool.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.235
Get two for one.

35:36.235 --> 35:38.770
- They're gonna look
the other way on this.

35:38.770 --> 35:41.106
As long as everybody's in.

35:41.106 --> 35:42.841
This'll make
a big mess in there.

35:42.841 --> 35:45.877
Who can pin what on who, right?

35:45.877 --> 35:47.579
- How far the other way
they gonna look?

35:47.579 --> 35:49.181
- Far...

35:51.450 --> 35:53.819
- For how long?

35:53.819 --> 35:55.987
- Who knows.

35:55.987 --> 35:58.690
- Ha! Man, this bullshit
too good to be true.

35:58.690 --> 36:01.126
[laughs]

36:01.126 --> 36:02.994
They get on this train,
we won't ever let 'em off.

36:02.994 --> 36:05.163
- Yeah, no shit.
That's what I tried to tell 'em.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.732
They just won't listen.

36:06.732 --> 36:08.800
- Who else is in?

36:09.868 --> 36:12.238
The whites are in?
- Yeah.

36:12.238 --> 36:14.573
- They'll let it happen?
- Yeah.

36:14.573 --> 36:16.842
- Well, well, well.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.877
You don't like it, do ya?

36:18.877 --> 36:20.512
- Fuck no.

36:20.512 --> 36:23.181
All my brother and I
have been trying to do is...

36:23.181 --> 36:26.285
keep the peace
in this shit hole town.

36:26.285 --> 36:28.287
Just, ease the pain.

36:30.055 --> 36:33.158
- You might be
the only honest cat I ever met.

36:35.160 --> 36:38.730
But this levee got to break
on its own.

36:38.730 --> 36:42.368
Can't plug every hole.

36:42.368 --> 36:45.571
Sometimes you just gotta let
that dam bust open.

36:45.571 --> 36:48.039
- Yeah, then what?

36:48.039 --> 36:52.177
- Then nothin'.
Starts all over again.

36:55.414 --> 36:57.316
We're in.

36:57.316 --> 36:59.451
You send that cracker our way,

36:59.451 --> 37:02.153
beat the motherfucker's soul
out of him.

37:03.422 --> 37:06.758

37:19.605 --> 37:21.407

get the fuck on the ground.

37:21.407 --> 37:25.577
- [indistinct shouting]

37:29.448 --> 37:30.916
- Time of your life there,
huh Andy?

37:30.916 --> 37:32.217
- Shut the fuck up, stay there.

37:32.217 --> 37:34.853
- Hey, you don't have to
tell me twice.

37:37.423 --> 37:39.224
- Man down!
Man down!

37:39.224 --> 37:41.192
- Motherfucker...

38:04.850 --> 38:06.752
- I'll fucking shoot her,
I'll fucking shoot her.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.493
- Oh, my God.

38:14.493 --> 38:17.028
Officer.

38:17.028 --> 38:18.764
I need an ambulance.

38:18.764 --> 38:20.566
Please.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.969
Officer no...

Somebody help me.

38:30.642 --> 38:34.946

39:09.080 --> 39:10.348
- [sobbing]

39:10.348 --> 39:12.751
- Aw, Jesus.
If you're that nervous,

39:12.751 --> 39:15.220
maybe robbery's not your thing.
What do you think?

39:15.220 --> 39:16.888
Come on fuckface.

39:16.888 --> 39:19.324
- The Duke...
- Oh fuck.

39:19.324 --> 39:21.259
- He, he said to come to you.

39:21.259 --> 39:23.228
He said you could help me.

39:23.228 --> 39:25.296
He, he said to trust you.

39:25.296 --> 39:28.400
I'm...
I'm fucked up man.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.669
I fucked up and I don't know
how to make it right.

39:30.669 --> 39:32.838
Can you, can you help me,
please?

39:32.838 --> 39:35.040
- Yeah.
- The Duke--

39:40.311 --> 39:42.213
- I'm choking you
with this tire iron

39:42.213 --> 39:43.415
because I don't wanna
fucking touch you,

39:43.415 --> 39:44.883
you piece of shit.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.151
- I deserve it.

39:46.151 --> 39:48.720
I'm stupid.
- You're stupid.

39:48.720 --> 39:52.357
- [gasping]
- So fucking stupid.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.964
You're a fucking dead man,
do you know that?

39:58.964 --> 40:03.168
Everybody, and I mean,
everybody wants to kill you.

40:03.168 --> 40:04.402
Including me.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.637
- It was an accident.

40:05.637 --> 40:08.273
It was a stupid fucking--
- No! No Kenny!

40:08.273 --> 40:10.308
You get in an accident
when you're skiing.

40:10.308 --> 40:12.177
Get it?
Not when you're cooking meth

40:12.177 --> 40:14.179
with your goddamn son
next to you.

40:14.179 --> 40:16.548
Fucking idiot.

40:21.753 --> 40:23.689
- Can I trust you?

40:25.023 --> 40:28.727
- No.
No, you can't.

40:28.727 --> 40:30.395
- Can...

40:30.395 --> 40:32.831
Can you tell me the truth,
at least?

40:35.300 --> 40:38.470
- Yeah, I'll tell you the truth.

40:38.470 --> 40:43.074
- Wh-what's gonna happen to me?

40:43.074 --> 40:45.110
- Jesus, Kenny.

40:45.110 --> 40:48.413
You know what?
The police find you,

40:48.413 --> 40:49.815
they're gonna say
you violated parole.

40:49.815 --> 40:51.449
They're gonna put you
in the pen,

40:51.449 --> 40:54.653
you'll be dead in five minutes.
If you continue to hide,

40:54.653 --> 40:56.788
there's so much heat out there
on everybody,

40:56.788 --> 40:59.491
even your own people
are gonna kill you.

40:59.491 --> 41:03.529
Just to get the cops
off their back.

41:03.529 --> 41:06.898
- That's not a lotta options...

41:13.371 --> 41:15.774
- You got one.

41:15.774 --> 41:17.609
And I'm gonna give it to you.

41:17.609 --> 41:19.444
Not because I give a flying shit
what happens to you,

41:19.444 --> 41:22.347
I'm only worried
what happens because of you.

41:22.347 --> 41:26.051
- Wh-what's my option?

41:32.357 --> 41:35.627
- Turn yourself in,
to the police station.

41:35.627 --> 41:38.029
They're gonna book you.

41:38.029 --> 41:39.965
And they'll put you
in protective custody

41:39.965 --> 41:42.868
until your trial.
You will plead guilty.

41:42.868 --> 41:44.870
And if you have
an ounce of humanity,

41:44.870 --> 41:47.105
you will not file any motions
or any of that bullshit.

41:47.105 --> 41:49.708
You're just gonna ride it out
on death row,

41:49.708 --> 41:53.211
until it's your fucking turn.

41:53.211 --> 41:55.747
And you can pray,
and you can beg.

41:55.747 --> 42:00.418
Do whatever you believe in,
for forgiveness.

42:06.291 --> 42:10.696
- Yeah, yeah.
I can do that.

42:11.362 --> 42:16.534
Okay, can you, can you take me?
Can you give me a ride?

42:16.534 --> 42:18.169
- No fucking way.

42:18.169 --> 42:19.771
- Ple-please?

42:19.771 --> 42:21.439
- If you're not outta here
in two minutes,

42:21.439 --> 42:22.841
I'm gonna kill you myself.

42:24.843 --> 42:26.778
- The fuck...

42:39.457 --> 42:42.728

43:41.186 --> 43:45.023

43:45.023 --> 43:47.558
I was um...

43:51.129 --> 43:53.765
It was a long day.

43:55.033 --> 43:56.735
- You wanna talk about it?

43:59.304 --> 44:00.939
- Naw...

44:00.939 --> 44:04.342
- Can I tell you something?

44:04.342 --> 44:08.714
It'll make you feel better,
I promise.

44:10.949 --> 44:14.552
- I don't wanna
hear anything good.

44:23.528 --> 44:24.830
- What do I do?

44:24.830 --> 44:26.898
- You're his wife.

44:26.898 --> 44:30.235
He doesn't get to tell you no.

44:30.235 --> 44:32.137
- But like this?

44:32.137 --> 44:36.507
- This, is all you get.

44:40.445 --> 44:45.550

46:00.091 --> 46:02.894

46:29.988 --> 46:33.992

46:33.992 --> 46:35.293
- OFFICER: Yeah,
you know you do that

46:35.293 --> 46:36.694
at the beginning
of the shift, right?

46:36.694 --> 46:39.264
You grab the gas card...
- It was me.

46:39.264 --> 46:41.499
- You fill up the squad car.

46:41.499 --> 46:45.303

46:52.677 --> 46:54.679
- Grab this motherfucker,

46:54.679 --> 46:58.449
- I'm not resisting,
I'm not resist--

47:00.418 --> 47:01.987
- Jesus Christ.
- Buzz us in.

47:01.987 --> 47:03.855
- No, put this piece of shit
in your squad car.

47:03.855 --> 47:05.256
I'm calling the captain.

47:05.256 --> 47:07.792
Hey, you're goin' home,
you fuck.

47:07.792 --> 47:09.861
- We'll pull around back.
- Yeah, wait for my call.

47:09.861 --> 47:11.963
Wait for my fucking call.

47:13.198 --> 47:17.735
- And you book him?

47:17.735 --> 47:19.504
What do you mean?

47:19.504 --> 47:21.206
Tell me you booked him...

47:21.206 --> 47:22.974
Tell me you booked--
Motherfuck...

Fuck, fuck, fuck!

47:27.946 --> 47:30.815
Fuck, fuck!

47:36.787 --> 47:39.324
- Give him the towel.

47:40.291 --> 47:42.994
It's not fucking prom night,
hurry up.

47:42.994 --> 47:44.862
All right, that's enough.

47:47.933 --> 47:50.201
Turn around, bend over.

47:50.201 --> 47:52.503
Spread 'em.

47:53.038 --> 47:54.539
- How's our VIP?

47:54.539 --> 47:56.874
- Scrubbed and clean, sir.

47:57.742 --> 47:59.444
- Make sure your boys
are in riot gear and shield

47:59.444 --> 48:01.179
when they walk him over tonight.

48:01.179 --> 48:04.049
This ain't your last fucking
shower tonight, sweetheart.

48:04.049 --> 48:06.084
You're done.
- Yes sir.

48:06.084 --> 48:07.352
Like I give a fuck
about the sock,

48:07.352 --> 48:09.454
[clapping]
let's go, let's go, let's go.

48:27.072 --> 48:28.206
You walk 10 feet ahead of me.

48:28.206 --> 48:29.907
You turn around,
you will get tazed.

48:29.907 --> 48:31.076
Got it?

48:31.076 --> 48:34.245
- Why, why ten feet?

48:34.245 --> 48:36.714
- 'Cause I fucking said so.

48:36.714 --> 48:37.815
Move.

49:40.311 --> 49:42.480
- Welcome back, brother.

49:42.480 --> 49:43.981
- It was an accident.

49:43.981 --> 49:45.783
- It's all good.

49:49.887 --> 49:53.824

50:38.436 --> 50:41.206
- [gurgling]

50:50.881 --> 50:54.819

set you free *

50:54.819 --> 50:58.889
* But you'll never follow me

51:03.628 --> 51:07.498
* The end of laughter

51:07.498 --> 51:11.001
* And soft lights

51:12.670 --> 51:17.342

[whistles loudly]

51:59.817 --> 52:01.619
Hey!

52:03.488 --> 52:06.624
Anybody uh,
do anything here for the boy?

52:06.624 --> 52:08.058
Like no service?

52:08.058 --> 52:09.994
- Used to, but now...

52:09.994 --> 52:13.198
Unless the city knows for sure
the deceased got religion,

52:13.198 --> 52:14.865
they don't do nothin'.

52:14.865 --> 52:19.003
Guess the atheist don't want no
prayers over them, by accident.

52:20.505 --> 52:21.672
- So nothing...

52:21.672 --> 52:23.474
- Mister, I don't know.

52:23.474 --> 52:25.109
- You want some time?

52:25.109 --> 52:26.344
Say somethin'?

52:26.344 --> 52:28.179
- Naw, I'm good, thanks.

52:28.179 --> 52:29.414
Thanks man.

52:29.414 --> 52:30.715
- Make you feel better.

52:30.715 --> 52:33.351
- Who cares how I feel?

52:34.552 --> 52:37.988
- Should we wait?
- Eh, I'll ask him.

52:37.988 --> 52:43.194
Mister, you want some time
with him before we finish up,

52:43.194 --> 52:45.129
it's no problem.

52:46.431 --> 52:50.034
- [sighs]
No.

52:52.337 --> 52:54.605
Sorry, go ahead.
Go ahead, finish.

52:54.605 --> 52:56.607
Thank you.

- The boys want
some candy sent over.

53:49.627 --> 53:51.496
- For what?
- For killin' that cracker.

53:51.496 --> 53:52.730
- You know I can't do that.

53:52.730 --> 53:53.898
- Made a deal.

53:53.898 --> 53:56.233
- They want their favors.
- What kind of favors?

53:56.233 --> 53:57.935
- The unreasonable kind.
- Who?

53:57.935 --> 53:58.836
- All of them.
- God--

54:00.137 --> 54:01.606
- Quite a mess you made here.

54:01.606 --> 54:03.474
- Yeah, well, everybody's
gonna see the mess I can make.

54:03.474 --> 54:04.775
- The guards are gonna
come down hard.

54:04.775 --> 54:07.044
The police,
they're gonna rain hell on you.

54:07.044 --> 54:08.245
You wanna wake that beast?

54:08.245 --> 54:09.814
Look, I get paid to give advice.

54:09.814 --> 54:10.981
So, I'm gonna give you some.

54:10.981 --> 54:13.217
