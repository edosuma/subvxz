WEBVTT

00:01.050 --> 00:02.740
Previously on rescue me...

00:02.760 --> 00:05.430
What if you never see him again?

00:06.080 --> 00:08.730
And I also started drinking
again. But let me explain.

00:08.760 --> 00:11.660
- And that is so stupid.
- It's--it's not stupid.

00:11.680 --> 00:14.640
I got--I figured it out. I
have a system.I can control it.

00:14.660 --> 00:16.500
Hook a brother up with
a long island iced tea.

00:16.520 --> 00:18.990
- Who's gonna know?
- I will.

00:19.020 --> 00:21.720
Besides, I told your mom
I'm watching out for you.

00:21.740 --> 00:24.430
I'm not gonna send you to school in
the morning all hungover and shit.

00:24.450 --> 00:26.360
You know, you're already
playing catch up as it is, dame.

00:26.380 --> 00:28.100
And, um, do you want to come?

00:28.120 --> 00:31.360
Are you--are you
asking me out on a date?

00:31.380 --> 00:33.860
- I should buy you a drink.
- We're opening our bar tonight.

00:33.880 --> 00:36.040
- Well, I'll see you later.
- Ok.

00:36.060 --> 00:37.660
- Bye.
- Bye bye.

00:37.670 --> 00:39.140
What you're telling me
as my best friend is that

00:39.170 --> 00:41.300
not in a million years would
this girl ever think about

00:41.320 --> 00:43.200
- taking me to bed, right?
- Never.Never!

00:43.230 --> 00:45.220
- The reptilian, repugnant creature that I am.
- Your words, your words.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.350
I have been a goddamn fool.

00:46.370 --> 00:49.030
Because all these years, tom, i thought
that we were friends, and we're not.

00:49.050 --> 00:50.610
You don't have to worry
about teddy anymore.

00:50.630 --> 00:52.420
You know how he was banged
up after your father died.

00:52.440 --> 00:52.930
Right.

00:52.950 --> 00:56.390
He's running around volunteering at
every single V.A.Hospital there is.

00:56.410 --> 01:00.310
It's not right when the man in the relationship
knows less in the sack than his lady does.

01:00.330 --> 01:01.620
I gotta get out of this.

01:01.640 --> 01:03.710
Yeah, well, what are you
gonna do about the father?

01:03.730 --> 01:05.330
How do I tell tommy
his daughter's a slut?

01:05.360 --> 01:07.680
By phone.From another state.

01:07.700 --> 01:11.090
How much is it to pop the kidney out?

01:11.100 --> 01:13.390
Well, you're insured through
the fire department, right?

01:13.410 --> 01:15.440
No, see, I can't use
my insurance company.

01:15.460 --> 01:17.950
I don't want the fire
department to know.

01:17.970 --> 01:22.400
It seems that our mademoiselle doesn't really
like our mr. Gavin so much to the degree

01:22.420 --> 01:26.080
that she was willing to engage me
in a good old-fashioned grudge hump.

01:28.980 --> 01:30.910
All right, bitches, all set outside.

01:30.920 --> 01:32.730
Let's wrap it up in here
and go hit the strip club.

01:32.750 --> 01:33.880
- Yeah, baby.
- Oh, my god.

01:33.910 --> 01:35.680
Franco, we just did a
full tour in the firehouse.

01:35.700 --> 01:39.160
We had 5 fires in 2 days, and now
you're talking about tits and ass?

01:39.170 --> 01:40.060
That's all you can talk about?Jesus.

01:40.090 --> 01:41.810
Um, actually, yes.

01:41.830 --> 01:44.450
Not to mention, scores serves
sandwiches till closing time.

01:44.480 --> 01:46.630
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

01:46.660 --> 01:47.650
All right, let's hurry
up and get over there.

01:47.680 --> 01:49.010
My man.

01:50.180 --> 01:52.460
Yo, yo, yo, bro. We're closed, man.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.820
I hear this is the
hottest joint downtown.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.840
Models and good tunes.

01:56.870 --> 02:00.540
Yeah, between the hours of 10:00 and
3:30, ok? Some come back tomorrow.

02:01.250 --> 02:03.360
Ok.Sorry.

02:04.950 --> 02:07.040
Goddamn.Guys, I'm gonna need
somebody else on the door

02:07.060 --> 02:08.810
if black shawn ain't coming back, ok.

02:08.830 --> 02:12.000
You know, got to get somebody to work
for him tomorrow down at the firehouse.

02:12.020 --> 02:14.830
So, wait, he's still not back at
work? Nobody knows where he is?

02:14.850 --> 02:17.140
I got a message from him
saying he's up in boston.

02:17.160 --> 02:19.430
I know he's got a cousin
in the department up there.

02:19.450 --> 02:21.430
He hasn't called colleen.
She's out of her mind.

02:21.450 --> 02:23.170
You know something, if we keep
covering for him like this,

02:23.190 --> 02:26.300
needles finds out, asshole mode
he's in, trouble in river city.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.790
I hope he's not pulling this
disappearing act because, you know,

02:28.810 --> 02:33.210
he knows I found out about what
went on with him and colleen.

02:35.320 --> 02:38.510
What? Guys, I know.

02:38.530 --> 02:41.220
We work in a firehouse. I
know everything you guys know.

02:41.250 --> 02:43.890
All right, and believe
me, I say this as a dad.

02:43.920 --> 02:49.870
You know, no dad could be prouder to find
out that his daughter is terrible in bed.

02:49.890 --> 02:52.270
- Right.
- That's right.

02:52.300 --> 02:54.390
- Yeah.
- You know what, to colleen.

02:54.420 --> 02:57.810
May she continue to make tommy's life miserable
for many, many, many more years to come.

02:57.840 --> 02:59.570
Here, here.

02:59.600 --> 03:02.670
Mike, do me a favor.Call shawn in the
morning, will you, find out what's going on.

03:02.700 --> 03:03.520
Ok.

03:03.540 --> 03:05.440
Holy shit, guys.

03:05.460 --> 03:07.500
Another 8 grandioso.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.080
- Oh, yeah.
- Really?Awesome.

03:09.110 --> 03:09.840
Nice.

03:11.230 --> 03:14.090
You know, we gotta give some of
this to charity, don't you think?

03:14.120 --> 03:15.890
Yeah, that's a good idea.
That's a good idea, right?

03:15.910 --> 03:17.040
Hey, charity.

03:17.070 --> 03:18.640
Yeah.

03:18.660 --> 03:20.250
Yeah, let's not do that. That sucks.

03:20.270 --> 03:21.170
What's wrong with you?

03:21.200 --> 03:22.900
You know, guys, my mother
made all this possible.

03:22.930 --> 03:25.800
You know, maybe we should give it to
like a cancer charity or something.

03:25.820 --> 03:28.180
Yeah.Yeah, that is a
really good idea, actually.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.500
Well, wait a second, shitbird. I
thought you said we we weren't doing it.

03:30.520 --> 03:33.110
Hey, come on. A
little, you know--jesus.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.580
I mean, people with cancer,
they have issues, franc.

03:35.610 --> 03:36.850
Jesus christ. You
know what I'm gonna do,

03:36.880 --> 03:37.890
I'm gonna take a little bit of this,

03:37.910 --> 03:39.530
and I'm going to make a
donation in mike's mom's name.

03:39.550 --> 03:41.760
Whoa, whoa, hold up.Before
you give all our money away,

03:41.760 --> 03:43.450
- what kind of cancer are we giving to?
- Yeah.

03:43.470 --> 03:47.050
I don't know, ass, face,
skin, brains, all of it.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.840
- Cock?
- Cock and balls.Everything.

03:49.870 --> 03:51.550
All right, I'm in.

03:51.570 --> 03:52.620
Sweet.

03:52.650 --> 03:54.880
What about dogs with cancer?

03:54.900 --> 03:56.340
Hey, dogs are welcome.

03:56.370 --> 03:59.210
- All right, I'm in.
- Sweet.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.860
Breasts? Breast cancer.How about that?

04:00.890 --> 04:02.340
Oh, yeah.

04:02.350 --> 04:05.410
Well, what?I mean, we're going to a titty
bar. It's like an investment, you know.

04:05.430 --> 04:07.510
I got it, cat cancer.

04:08.570 --> 04:11.540
Titty bar made me think
of pussy and, you know.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.580
All set downstairs, boys.

04:13.600 --> 04:17.390
Hey, derek, we're creating a special
slush fund for cancer research.You want in?

04:17.420 --> 04:20.140
Cock, tits, ass, animal, all taken.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.460
What about the liver?

04:22.480 --> 04:23.560
- I'll drink to that.
- Duh.

04:23.590 --> 04:25.070
Yeah. Of course, the liver.

04:25.950 --> 04:28.500
Come on, boys, belly up. Toast to us.

04:28.520 --> 04:31.640
Uh, derek and tommy, I'm gonna pour
you guys a little shot of ginger ale

04:31.670 --> 04:34.590
since you're girly boys
who can't handle your booze.

04:34.610 --> 04:36.510
To us, gents.

04:36.540 --> 04:39.660
To, uh, garbage bags full of cash.

04:39.690 --> 04:40.820
To liver cancer.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.800
- Here.
- Cheers.Bam.

04:45.070 --> 04:47.890
Let's go, boys.The strippers aren't going
to shove dollar bills between their own jugs.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.580
You know, you guys go
ahead.I'm gonna stay and,

04:49.610 --> 04:51.770
you know, close up shop,
take care of the money.

04:53.080 --> 04:54.760
No, it's ok, I got it.
Don't worry about it.

04:54.790 --> 04:56.490
No, no, it's fine. I got
like a place where I hide it.

04:56.510 --> 04:57.490
It's very secretive, you know.

04:57.520 --> 04:59.960
Yeah, well, I'm gonna keep it at
lou's place. So it's not a big thing.

04:59.970 --> 05:02.170
All right, but I know how to retain
it and everything.It's my job.

05:02.220 --> 05:04.260
- You know what I mean, it's my job.
- It's not your job tonight.

05:04.290 --> 05:05.740
I got it. Ok?

05:05.770 --> 05:07.270
- You got it?
- I just said I got it.

05:07.290 --> 05:09.000
Ok. All right, you got it.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.460
You guys go ahead.

05:10.480 --> 05:13.070
Have a good time at scores.

05:13.090 --> 05:14.460
All right?

05:14.490 --> 05:17.800
And, you know, I can give you guys a couple of
tips that will actually help you guys out there.

05:17.820 --> 05:18.350
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

05:18.370 --> 05:20.050
When you get to the strip
club, instead of going inside,

05:20.080 --> 05:22.920
just bang your head
against the wall outside,

05:22.950 --> 05:25.010
take the money out of your
pocket, and light it on fire.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.710
You'll still wake up in the
morning with a raging headache,

05:26.740 --> 05:28.210
your dick in your
hand, and no money, but

05:28.240 --> 05:29.970
at least you won't be late for work.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.660
See you.

05:32.540 --> 05:33.650
We're going to be
late for work tomorrow.

05:33.680 --> 05:34.710
Yeah, that's what I figured.

05:34.730 --> 05:36.700
- Bye, asshole.
- See you, douchebag.

05:36.720 --> 05:39.160
King of the douchebags, ok. My
title deserves a little respect.

05:39.190 --> 05:41.540
Yeah, whatever. You all set?

05:41.560 --> 05:43.430
I ain't gonna go to
scores. You want me to stay?

05:43.460 --> 05:44.660
No, no, I'm good.

05:44.690 --> 05:48.090
You sure?You're gonna be by
yourself in a room full of booze.

05:50.650 --> 05:52.210
Yeah, I'm good.

05:52.240 --> 05:53.580
- You sure?
- I'm your sponsor.

05:53.610 --> 05:54.680
Come on, i know what I'm talking about.

05:54.710 --> 05:57.080
Yeah, but bottom line, tommy,
we're both just a couple of drunks.

05:57.090 --> 06:00.200
Yeah, but I'm a higher
ranking drunk than you, so

06:00.220 --> 06:03.730
if A.A.Was like an army, I'd be a
5-star general, and you're just a grunt.

06:03.750 --> 06:05.580
Take it as an order. I'm fine.

06:05.610 --> 06:06.760
Get out of here.

06:06.770 --> 06:09.310
- Yes, sir.
- All right.Bye.

09:03.560 --> 09:05.240
I love you.

09:05.740 --> 09:08.670
I always loved you.

09:09.840 --> 09:13.140
I know I never told you often enough.

09:13.670 --> 09:18.350
You were the best goddamn
center fielder in high school.

09:18.370 --> 09:22.050
And on ice, heh heh, tough as nails.

09:22.070 --> 09:24.350
Not to mention the way you fight fire.

09:24.360 --> 09:29.430
You put every other fireman I ever
knew to absolute goddamn shame.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.770
I should have said this
shit when I was alive.

09:31.780 --> 09:34.790
But hell, I'm saying it now.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.820
You are the best goddamn son
a father could ever hope for.

09:43.220 --> 09:45.710
You happy now?

09:47.130 --> 09:49.610
- Yeah.
- Well, get over it.

09:49.630 --> 09:54.590
Because if you believe all that, I got some
land down in florida I might want to sell you.

09:55.330 --> 09:57.350
Now give me a goddamn drink.

09:57.370 --> 10:00.780
Middletons, not that bottom shelf shit.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.990
He was a pretty good center fielder.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.010
No bat, hell of a glove.

10:07.850 --> 10:09.930
I'll take the bottom shelf shit.

10:09.950 --> 10:13.140
- Jameson'S.
- What is that with you?

10:13.160 --> 10:17.620
Budweiser, jameson's,
always the low-rent shit.

10:17.650 --> 10:20.050
Hey, you know what, I
like the way it tastes.

10:20.070 --> 10:22.770
I could give a shit
about what people think.

10:24.330 --> 10:26.750
He's a great fireman.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.470
No bustin' balls.

10:28.490 --> 10:29.990
He's too risky.

10:30.010 --> 10:31.680
Gets the job done.

10:31.700 --> 10:36.650
You know how many people would be dead
but for him breaking rules, taking chances?

10:36.670 --> 10:40.090
Lot of kids would be
on this side of the bar.

10:40.110 --> 10:43.900
Most guys, they play it safe.

10:43.920 --> 10:47.560
Him, he pushes the envelope.

10:47.580 --> 10:50.730
Like, um, what's his name?

10:50.750 --> 10:52.310
Who's that quarterback?

10:52.330 --> 10:54.920
He used to scramble around
like a goddamn maniac.

10:54.940 --> 10:56.260
Doug flutie?

10:56.280 --> 10:58.860
He's the doug flutie of fire?

10:58.880 --> 11:00.630
That's funny, dad.

11:00.650 --> 11:03.740
Hey, flutie, where we you on 9/11?

11:04.990 --> 11:08.100
Yeah, doug, where were you?

11:08.830 --> 11:10.650
Don't give me that, you know,

11:10.660 --> 11:14.510
"if only I knew that you were running
into the second tower" bullshit.

11:14.530 --> 11:17.120
I only ran
in because--

11:17.140 --> 11:19.760
well, because it was
the next goddamn job.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.730
But you, i can't figure it
out. What were you waiting for?

11:22.750 --> 11:24.920
Too much of a goddamn pussy to go in?

11:24.940 --> 11:28.500
First tower comes down, they're
yelling, "pull out! Pull out!"

11:28.530 --> 11:30.740
All I know is if you're a fireman

11:30.760 --> 11:36.430
and you ain't carrying someone else and
you've still got 2 legs and 2 goddamn feet,

11:36.450 --> 11:39.910
you move on to the next goddamn job.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.570
Doug flutie, my ass. Doug
flutie would have run in.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.730
No balls, tom. No balls at all.

11:45.750 --> 11:48.790
- I was looking for you, asshole.
- Why, huh?

11:48.820 --> 11:51.600
- Jesus christ.
- Holy shit.

11:51.620 --> 11:53.430
Don't tell me you were afraid.

11:53.450 --> 11:55.080
- What?
- He was afraid.

11:55.110 --> 11:57.960
- I was worried.
- About what?

11:57.980 --> 12:00.210
- You.
- Me?

12:00.230 --> 12:02.790
600, 700 fire fighters in there.

12:02.800 --> 12:05.440
Thousands of other people
needing to be rescued.

12:05.460 --> 12:06.850
You worried about me?

12:06.870 --> 12:08.400
- You were scared.
- Shut up.

12:08.420 --> 12:11.540
No, you were scared to go into
the second tower on your own.

12:11.550 --> 12:13.400
I think you were afraid
to go up the first time,

12:13.410 --> 12:17.620
so you were hoping that you could find some
bullshit reason so you could stay downstairs.

12:17.650 --> 12:19.530
Makes all kinds of sense right now.

12:19.550 --> 12:22.050
This is it, right?This is
it, pops.This is it, ain't it?

12:22.070 --> 12:24.300
- That ain't it.
- This is it.

12:24.320 --> 12:27.200
This is the nail right
on the goddamn head.

12:27.200 --> 12:30.300
- I'm warning you, johnny.
- Warning me how?

12:30.310 --> 12:32.300
This makes perfect, complete sense here.

12:32.330 --> 12:33.470
Wait, wait, you didn't
want to go in, tom?

12:33.490 --> 12:35.210
Of course I wanted to go in.

12:35.230 --> 12:37.730
You didn't want to go in. Holy shit.

12:37.750 --> 12:39.970
Shut your fat cop face, johnny, ok.

12:39.990 --> 12:42.020
- You don't know shit about it.
- Why?

12:42.050 --> 12:44.290
'Cause you're a cop. You
don't know shit about it.

12:44.320 --> 12:46.430
I know a bullshit rap when i hear it.

12:46.450 --> 12:48.910
I swear on my kids' souls, johnny.

12:48.930 --> 12:51.860
You're a goddamn coward.

12:51.890 --> 12:54.510
All this show.

12:54.530 --> 12:56.060
All the balls.

12:56.090 --> 12:57.510
All the bravado.

12:57.540 --> 12:59.680
Running in like a madman.

12:59.700 --> 13:02.400
Tommy "goddamn" gavin,

13:02.420 --> 13:05.760
the firefighter with the biggest
cock on the goddamn block.

13:05.780 --> 13:09.710
You know what, it's all bullshit, bro.

13:09.730 --> 13:10.960
You know why?

13:10.980 --> 13:13.060
'Cause the
one day--

13:13.080 --> 13:16.980
the one goddamn day
that your department,

13:17.010 --> 13:21.040
that your crew, that your goddamn
country needed you the most,

13:21.060 --> 13:24.670
you froze up like a goddamn
needle-ass little dick.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.290
Anybody else want some?

13:45.310 --> 13:46.510
You're all right, you're all right.

13:46.530 --> 13:48.530
It's all right. It's all right.Get up.

13:49.470 --> 13:51.650
I wish you boys could
learn to get along.

13:54.490 --> 13:56.250
Jeez.

14:08.010 --> 14:11.460
When we were riding down in the rig

14:11.500 --> 14:14.760
that morning,

14:14.780 --> 14:17.530
I think we were figuring
out what we were gonna do.

14:17.560 --> 14:20.410
I was ok, so was he.

14:20.420 --> 14:24.780
Getting off the rig, fine.

14:24.800 --> 14:29.100
Going in, going up,

14:29.120 --> 14:32.560
coming out, the first couple of saves,

14:32.590 --> 14:35.270
all good.

14:36.210 --> 14:39.260
Even as the building...

14:39.290 --> 14:41.690
was coming down.

14:41.700 --> 14:45.900
The rumble, all instinct.

14:45.920 --> 14:52.070
Run, roll, cover, fine.

14:53.930 --> 14:56.630
But after...

14:58.000 --> 15:00.740
rubbed all that shit out of my eyes,

15:00.760 --> 15:02.110
out of my ears,

15:02.140 --> 15:06.010
couldn't see anything,
couldn't hear anything.

15:10.080 --> 15:16.070
You never told us what
to do after, did you?

15:16.090 --> 15:18.750
Running up the beach on d-day, huh?

15:18.780 --> 15:21.630
Guys on the left of you, the right
of you getting their heads blown off.

15:21.660 --> 15:23.570
You kept running up the beach.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.000
Hitler's holy hell.

15:25.020 --> 15:27.940
We heard all about that, right?

15:28.560 --> 15:30.680
D-day.

15:30.700 --> 15:34.190
The marching to berlin.
Goddamn concentration camps.

15:34.210 --> 15:37.890
Going in, freeing everybody
up. We heard all about that.

15:37.910 --> 15:42.220
Goddamn hero. Goddamn decorated hero.

15:42.240 --> 15:45.170
What were we supposed to do after?
You never told us what you did after.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.670
Far as I could tell, you just
keep your goddamn mouth shut

15:47.700 --> 15:50.120
unless you're opening
it to pour booze in.

15:50.140 --> 15:52.620
And you cheat on your wife.

15:52.640 --> 15:55.000
That's all i knew about
after, you asshole.

15:55.020 --> 15:58.340
You goddamn son of a bitch.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.590
Goddamn teddy, vietnam.

16:03.610 --> 16:07.340
Goddamn million gooks dead, 50,000
americans. Goddamn won the war.

16:07.360 --> 16:11.580
What did he do when he came home? After?

16:11.610 --> 16:16.100
Drink, fight, cheat on his wife.

16:20.360 --> 16:25.460
I ain't no goddamn coward. I got
goddamn medals out the ass, asshole.

16:25.480 --> 16:28.800
Proves I'm a hero.

16:28.820 --> 16:35.040
God, bombs going off, buildings
coming down. I know exactly what to do.

16:35.070 --> 16:39.980
If it happened right now, if this bar
blew up, I'd know exactly what to do.

16:42.700 --> 16:47.290
Kids, marriage. That's
where--that's where I suck.

16:47.320 --> 16:50.340
That's where I really suck.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.380
That shit...

16:53.410 --> 16:56.330
that scares the balls off of me.

17:02.900 --> 17:06.240
Here I am after,

17:06.260 --> 17:09.050
surrounded by booze

17:09.079 --> 17:11.670
and dead assholes.

17:12.520 --> 17:14.599
Thanks.

17:38.820 --> 17:41.110
Get up slow.

17:41.990 --> 17:43.500
Ok.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.610
This is how it's gonna go.

17:44.630 --> 17:46.410
You're gonna take that
bag of cash I saw earlier.

17:46.430 --> 17:47.080
Yeah.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.410
You're gonna hand it over to me.

17:48.430 --> 17:51.670
And if you so much as twitch
a muscle while you're doing it,

17:51.690 --> 17:53.300
I'm gonna blow your goddamn head off.

17:53.330 --> 17:56.070
- Capiche?
- Ok.

17:57.100 --> 17:59.330
Listen to me, there's no cash with me.

17:59.350 --> 18:01.250
They took the bag with them when they—

18:01.270 --> 18:03.980
Asshole, I saw them leave.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.780
No bag. Get it.Now.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.470
Ok.

18:13.230 --> 18:14.640
We have security cameras
in here, you know.

18:14.660 --> 18:16.030
You don't got shit.

18:16.050 --> 18:20.030
You're running an illegal joint under
the table and off the books, asshole.

18:25.010 --> 18:28.010
- Nice and easy.
- Ok.

18:39.330 --> 18:43.360
Ok, take the money out of the bag.

18:43.380 --> 18:45.980
Put it down so I can see it.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.670
And you're gonna put it back in.

18:48.690 --> 18:52.110
Very slowly.

18:54.490 --> 18:56.630
If you play your cards right,

18:56.650 --> 18:58.320
I'm going to leave quietly,

18:58.350 --> 19:00.310
and you're not going to
tell anybody about this,

19:00.340 --> 19:04.420
because reporting a robbery of
unreported income would be insane.

19:04.440 --> 19:08.260
As would doing anything other
than what I just told you.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.780
Right.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.930
- How much of this should--
- Just keep it coming.

19:13.480 --> 19:15.500
Putting it right here.

19:16.020 --> 19:17.390
Nice.

19:21.750 --> 19:23.750
Shit.

19:28.650 --> 19:31.460
Just take the money.

19:35.360 --> 19:38.260
Can you hear me?

19:41.270 --> 19:43.570
Hey.

19:45.240 --> 19:46.480
Hey.

19:49.070 --> 19:52.030
Jesus christ.

19:55.580 --> 19:58.950
You want to be a hero, asshole?

20:26.150 --> 20:28.090
You want to be a goddamn hero?

20:37.940 --> 20:39.990
Guess I do.

21:01.010 --> 21:03.390
Jesus, dad.

21:12.820 --> 21:15.610
You shot my insides out.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.160
Asshole.

21:18.190 --> 21:20.740
That's your own goddamn kid.

21:20.760 --> 21:22.990
Shit. Classic.

21:23.010 --> 21:24.950
Killed your own kid, tom.

21:24.970 --> 21:27.370
Shit, stay away from damian, will you?

21:27.390 --> 21:29.560
What the hell, dad?

21:33.160 --> 21:34.770
Connor?

21:34.800 --> 21:37.200
Yeah. Shit.

21:37.220 --> 21:38.900
Look at me.

21:38.920 --> 21:40.640
He doesn't get it, kid.

21:40.660 --> 21:42.500
This is what he would have been.

21:42.530 --> 21:45.370
Shit, it might be what he is.

21:45.400 --> 21:46.590
He's a junkie.

21:46.610 --> 21:48.940
I'm telling you, tommy,
stay away from my kid.

21:48.960 --> 21:49.810
Shut up.

21:49.840 --> 21:52.520
I'm back, dad. I'm here.

21:52.540 --> 21:54.910
I'm a junkie.

21:55.360 --> 21:56.840
I need that cash.

21:56.860 --> 21:59.470
He's a goddamn junkie.

21:59.490 --> 22:01.160
- This is beautiful.
- Oh, tommy.

22:01.720 --> 22:02.690
He's a junkie.

22:02.710 --> 22:04.300
- That's what you get.
- That's perfect.

22:04.320 --> 22:05.870
Shut up.

22:06.570 --> 22:08.170
Your kid's a freakin' junkie.

22:08.190 --> 22:10.150
Knock it off.

22:10.170 --> 22:12.560
He's a junkie. That's
what you get, tommy.

22:15.490 --> 22:19.000
Hey, tom, it's lou.

22:19.770 --> 22:22.800
You want to talk about anything? ?

22:29.670 --> 22:32.820
Garrity went nuts about the money.

22:32.850 --> 22:34.220
Worried.

22:34.250 --> 22:36.420
I realized I forgot my wallet.

22:36.450 --> 22:42.800
To be honest, I felt bad about leaving
you to clean up in a room full of booze.

22:43.330 --> 22:46.520
So much temptation.

22:47.250 --> 22:50.690
In the cab on the way
back there, I realized,

22:50.710 --> 22:53.570
wouldn't it be awesome

22:53.590 --> 22:55.830
if tommy was just sitting at the bar

22:55.850 --> 22:59.060
drinking himself silly when I got there?

22:59.070 --> 23:01.780
I like when you drink.

23:01.800 --> 23:07.610
And lo and behold, my wish came true.

23:07.630 --> 23:11.940
Although silly ain't exactly what I saw.

23:13.250 --> 23:15.640
Sober,

23:15.660 --> 23:17.830
you're a great fireman

23:17.850 --> 23:20.930
and a selfish, spiteful,

23:20.960 --> 23:23.520
hit the nail on the head,
no bullshit kind of a guy.

23:23.540 --> 23:25.420
Drunk,

23:25.440 --> 23:27.560
you're a great fireman

23:27.590 --> 23:30.280
and a selfish, spiteful,

23:30.300 --> 23:33.480
hit the nail on the head kind of guy,

23:33.510 --> 23:35.430
but funny.

23:35.450 --> 23:37.880
And I like funny.

23:38.370 --> 23:44.420
So I say we keep the
booze and we lose the guns.

23:44.430 --> 23:48.690
I know you've got demons jumping out of your
head, I just don't want you shooting at them.

23:48.700 --> 23:50.240
We'll tell the guys you saw

23:50.250 --> 23:53.920
rats the size of michael
moore running around the joint.

23:53.950 --> 23:56.590
You know, which means,
of course, that they were

23:56.600 --> 24:01.770
big and wearing little baseball caps, and
they were also in favor of gun control laws.

24:01.790 --> 24:03.680
All right.

24:17.420 --> 24:20.280
I just want
to say--ahem--

24:20.300 --> 24:22.220
thanks for tonight.

24:22.880 --> 24:28.550
And, uh, ahem, I take back

24:28.570 --> 24:33.080
all those nasty things I said
when we were having that, uh,

24:33.090 --> 24:36.480
tiff the other...

24:36.500 --> 24:38.230
I didn't mean all that stuff.

24:38.250 --> 24:38.840
Ok.

24:38.860 --> 24:43.140
You're really the best
friend a guy could ever have.

24:43.160 --> 24:45.900
Water under the bridge, pal.

24:58.390 --> 25:00.030
What?

25:00.050 --> 25:02.320
The things that you said?

25:02.340 --> 25:04.270
What about them?

25:04.990 --> 25:06.920
Do you take them back?

25:06.940 --> 25:10.630
No.No, I meant every goddamn word of it.

25:11.630 --> 25:13.720
You don't want to take back any of that?

25:13.730 --> 25:16.930
Nope. Nope.

25:16.950 --> 25:18.470
Ok.

25:18.920 --> 25:22.540
Oh, and, uh, I slept with frenchie.

25:28.050 --> 25:29.420
I'm sorry, what?

25:29.430 --> 25:32.060
I slept with frenchie.

25:32.070 --> 25:34.550
And I got the note to prove it.

25:58.670 --> 26:02.030
You're carrying that around with you?

26:02.050 --> 26:03.820
Wouldn't you?

26:07.600 --> 26:09.300
Jeez, it sounds like the
end of the world down here.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.720
Jesus, he's pounding the
leather off that thing.

26:12.530 --> 26:13.080
Hey.

26:13.100 --> 26:14.990
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:16.280 --> 26:17.290
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

26:17.300 --> 26:19.470
Yeah, no more spic jokes.

26:21.020 --> 26:22.970
No, F.D.N.Y. Boxing team.

26:22.990 --> 26:25.480
We get him in the ring, we
get some side action going,

26:25.510 --> 26:26.910
pick up a little extra cabbage.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.860
I mean, with me and you
coaching him, we'll clean up.

26:28.880 --> 26:31.330
Whatever happened to
no more mr. Nice guy,

26:31.360 --> 26:33.500
you guys don't give me
any respect, buh-buh-buh?

26:33.520 --> 26:35.750
That's the job. This is
a chance to make money.

26:35.760 --> 26:39.540
And for that, I will revert back
to my happy-go-lucky whore self.

26:39.580 --> 26:41.840
Just, uh, think he'll go for it?

26:41.860 --> 26:43.620
Can't hurt to ask.

26:47.570 --> 26:49.780
Christ, let's let him finish up first.

26:55.050 --> 26:57.810
- You gavin?
- Yep.

26:57.830 --> 27:00.750
- On your break?
- Sorta.

27:00.770 --> 27:03.220
It's hard work, ain't it?

27:03.240 --> 27:05.000
Hey, I'm just happy to help out.

27:05.010 --> 27:07.420
That's what I hear.

27:07.450 --> 27:11.820
So, uh, can you do me?

27:11.840 --> 27:12.960
Pardon?

27:12.980 --> 27:15.630
What you did for lester, i want it done.

27:15.650 --> 27:18.560
I didn't do anything to lester.
Look, he's right over there.

27:18.580 --> 27:24.470
I sit alone in a room all
day praying for death to come.

27:24.490 --> 27:27.070
You got to do this for me.

27:27.090 --> 27:28.720
Please.

27:28.740 --> 27:29.960
Listen to me.

27:29.990 --> 27:31.940
I killed 5 men in my life.

27:31.960 --> 27:35.510
4 of them had slanty eyes and
were shooting at me and my buddies.

27:35.530 --> 27:38.910
The other one was a drunk driver
who ran over my 10-year-old nephew.

27:38.930 --> 27:41.060
They all had it coming.

27:41.070 --> 27:44.510
But I'll be goddamned if
I'm gonna kill a war hero,

27:44.530 --> 27:47.600
a brother in arms. I just won't do it.

27:47.610 --> 27:49.890
Then you're a fag.

27:51.100 --> 27:55.450
Say that again, war hero
or not, I'll kill you.

27:55.470 --> 27:57.660
You are a fag.

27:58.820 --> 28:03.130
Ok, all right. We're on.

28:05.810 --> 28:07.730
5 goddamn miles.

28:07.740 --> 28:09.720
You know, i nearly had a heart attack.

28:09.740 --> 28:11.430
My legs feel like jell-O.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.390
Oh, that's all right,
dude. You'll get used to it.

28:13.410 --> 28:14.610
Yeah, when?

28:14.640 --> 28:17.840
Uh, depends on you.

28:18.490 --> 28:20.360
You're pretty good with that thing.

28:20.380 --> 28:21.660
I'm ok.

28:21.690 --> 28:23.350
No, seriously, dude. When did you learn?

28:23.380 --> 28:26.410
I started taking lessons a
while ago. This and voice.

28:26.430 --> 28:27.390
Voice?

28:27.410 --> 28:29.840
Yeah, you know, like singing lessons.

28:30.970 --> 28:35.320
Dude, if you tell any of the guys at the
house, I swear to god, I'll kick your ass.

28:35.340 --> 28:37.880
Nah, your secret's safe with me.

28:37.900 --> 28:40.140
- So sing something.
- I don't know, dude.

28:40.160 --> 28:45.070
I never, like, really sang in front of anybody
except my vocal coach and, like, my band.

28:45.090 --> 28:46.220
You got a band?

28:46.230 --> 28:50.320
Yeah, yeah, a couple of N.Y.U.Music
grad students i picked up.

28:50.340 --> 28:53.280
So if you got a band, you're
probably pretty good by now, right?

28:53.300 --> 28:55.120
Yeah, listen, you know, like

28:55.140 --> 28:57.790
sean's sleeping in the other room
and he's got the flu and stuff.

28:57.810 --> 29:00.300
Oh, come on.See, now
you're just making excuses.

29:00.320 --> 29:02.390
I mean, how are you going to
sing to a stadium full of people

29:02.390 --> 29:04.530
if you can't even sing
to me in this room?

29:05.370 --> 29:06.170
I guess you're right.

29:06.200 --> 29:09.450
I mean, there is this one tune I've kind of
been working pretty hard on, like, that I wrote.

29:09.470 --> 29:11.700
Ok, so sing it.

29:14.170 --> 29:17.310
- All right, but my chord
progression's-- - Blah blah blah.

29:17.340 --> 29:19.310
- Just get on with the freakin' thing.
- All right, all right.

29:19.330 --> 29:22.910
I'll--I'll do like
a verse or something.

29:30.610 --> 29:37.400
* Nothing left to look at
but what lies inside me, *

29:37.420 --> 29:43.410
* my first reality cannot
take what lies ahead, *

29:43.420 --> 29:48.760
* clear the path of destination
is what you once... *

29:48.770 --> 29:50.850
What?

29:50.870 --> 29:52.060
That was good.

29:52.090 --> 29:53.310
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

29:53.330 --> 29:54.670
Yeah, I mean, you know,

29:54.700 --> 29:56.860
I was ready to earn an
academy award nomination

29:56.880 --> 29:59.270
trying to mask my horror
over how badly it sucked,

29:59.280 --> 30:01.030
but it's actually pretty decent.

30:01.040 --> 30:02.020
Thanks, bro.

30:02.040 --> 30:04.300
You mind if I take a crack at it?

30:04.310 --> 30:06.500
Yeah, knock yourself out, bro.

30:06.510 --> 30:08.220
All right.

30:14.320 --> 30:16.380
Holy shit, you got skills.

30:17.590 --> 30:23.450
* Left to look at but
what lies inside me, *

30:23.470 --> 30:25.310
* my first reality *

30:25.330 --> 30:27.770
dude, you go to be in my band, bro.

30:27.790 --> 30:29.560
- That was sick.
- Count me in, bro.

30:29.580 --> 30:32.330
- Holy shit, bro.
- What are you guys called?

30:32.350 --> 30:35.010
- Hot lunch.
- Count me out, bro.

30:35.020 --> 30:37.340
- What?
- Hot lunch?

30:37.360 --> 30:38.690
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

30:38.710 --> 30:40.510
You know what a hot lunch is, right?

30:40.530 --> 30:42.770
Yeah, like salisbury
steak, like taco tuesday.

30:42.790 --> 30:47.400
No, no, it's not like salisbury steak.
It's like a euphemism for a sexual term.

30:47.420 --> 30:50.800
It's like when you're doing a
chick and she takes a dump on you.

30:50.830 --> 30:53.830
- No way.
- Yes way.Like a cleveland steamer.

30:53.850 --> 30:56.470
- What's that?
- Same thing.

30:57.280 --> 31:00.730
Dude, I guess I'm never
gonna go to cleveland.

31:05.840 --> 31:07.520
I gotta take a piss.

31:07.530 --> 31:09.010
Sean, are you all right, dude?

31:09.020 --> 31:10.640
Yeah.

31:10.660 --> 31:11.850
He don't look too good.

31:11.870 --> 31:14.540
You think I should, like,
make him some tea or something?

31:21.290 --> 31:23.490
Oh, my god.

31:23.520 --> 31:25.990
Sean.Sean, you all right?

31:26.010 --> 31:27.750
Holy shit, mike, he's pissing blood.

31:27.780 --> 31:29.540
All right, call an ambulance.

31:30.110 --> 31:32.020
Sean?

31:37.340 --> 31:40.000
- Hey, franc.
- Hey.

31:40.030 --> 31:41.860
Lot of iron on that bar.

31:41.880 --> 31:43.840
What is that, 200, 240?

31:43.850 --> 31:46.950
Oh, I don't know,
maybe 280 on a good day.

31:47.850 --> 31:49.720
Animale, this kid, huh?

31:49.740 --> 31:51.120
Yeah.

31:53.960 --> 31:55.610
Got a proposition for you, franco.

31:55.640 --> 31:59.030
Yeah?Well, I'm very flattered, lou,
but I don't believe in gay marriage.

31:59.050 --> 32:01.120
- Hilarious.
- This kid cracks me up.

32:01.140 --> 32:04.860
No.Now look, we saw you beating the
heavy bag into submission the other day.

32:04.890 --> 32:07.090
We were wondering, maybe you ever
thought about stepping into the ring.

32:07.880 --> 32:10.150
- Boxing?
- No, bullfighting.

32:10.170 --> 32:11.500
What are you doing?

32:11.520 --> 32:16.020
Look, I cornered a couple of fighters back
in the day, and i think you got potential.

32:16.040 --> 32:19.240
- You got a thunderous left.
- Thanks, lou.

32:19.260 --> 32:20.810
You, uh, you used to
be a boxing trainer?

32:20.840 --> 32:21.830
Yeah, indeed I was.

32:21.850 --> 32:25.540
I took joltin' joel johansson to
the department title back in '86.

32:25.570 --> 32:28.260
He had a brief but minorly
successful golden gloves run.

32:28.280 --> 32:28.990
No shit.

32:29.020 --> 32:31.120
You guys talking about
slow joel johansson?

32:31.140 --> 32:33.490
Want to mind your business,
tommy? We're talking here.

32:33.510 --> 32:35.290
Who's, uh, who's slow joel?

32:35.310 --> 32:38.100
You know joel.He comes by the house
a couple times a year.He's got the

32:38.130 --> 32:40.920
pushed-in nose, scars under the eyes.

32:40.940 --> 32:43.930
Wears the pull-down wool cap.

32:43.940 --> 32:45.310
Talks like marlee matlin.

32:45.330 --> 32:48.370
Oh.Oh, that guy is
joltin' joel johansson?

32:48.380 --> 32:50.940
Was joltin' joel, is slow joel.

32:50.960 --> 32:54.240
Hey, it's not my fault he kept dropping
his goddamn hands like sugar ray leonard.

32:54.260 --> 32:56.650
The guy was an ape
trying to be a hot dog.

32:56.670 --> 32:59.590
But you're smarter than
that, franco.You can move.

32:59.610 --> 33:02.000
And lou made a lot of
money with joltin' joel.

33:02.020 --> 33:04.860
I mean, the side action on
these fights are over the moon.

33:04.870 --> 33:06.130
Yeah.

33:06.150 --> 33:08.400
And now he shits his pants twice a day.

33:08.420 --> 33:11.730
Tommy, why don't you go be a pain in the
ass somewhere else? We're talking here.

33:11.750 --> 33:15.000
Ok.Don't forget to
mention the glass eye.

33:15.460 --> 33:16.940
Uh, the what?

33:16.960 --> 33:20.190
It's totally unrelated.He got excited,
hit himself in the face with a fork.

33:20.220 --> 33:22.250
Joel loved a good meal.

33:22.260 --> 33:23.410
What do you think?

33:23.430 --> 33:25.720
I don't know, guys. I've been in
the ring before, you know, lou.

33:25.740 --> 33:27.290
Think I'll just stick
to hitting the heavy bag.

33:27.310 --> 33:29.050
Bag don't hit back if
you know what i mean.

33:29.070 --> 33:32.840
Ah, come on.I'm serious here,
franco, you got real talent.

33:32.860 --> 33:35.180
This could be huge
with the right guidance.

33:35.200 --> 33:38.600
Yeah.Well, you know, I'm just not to
keen on messing with the catnip, you know.

33:38.620 --> 33:40.030
End up looking like mickey rourke.

33:40.050 --> 33:42.410
He looked good in sin
city. He was animated.

33:42.420 --> 33:46.590
Look, franc, man was not meant to hit
80 pounds of sand hanging from a ceiling.

33:46.610 --> 33:48.360
They were meant to hit other men.

33:48.370 --> 33:51.950
Want to deny yourself the opportunity of
venting all that rage and frustration you have

33:51.980 --> 33:54.810
over bush and 9/11 out on
another living human being?

33:54.840 --> 33:58.670
And you could imagine bush's face on the head
of your opponent just before you cave it in.

33:58.680 --> 34:01.160
Yeah, if it's such a good idea, how
come you don't step into the ring, huh?

34:01.180 --> 34:02.360
'Cause I'm a pussy.

34:02.380 --> 34:05.730
But you, my giant latin
friend, you are one thick spic.

34:05.750 --> 34:08.179
I mean, the very sight of you
strikes fear in the hearts of men.

34:08.190 --> 34:09.380
Me included.

34:09.400 --> 34:12.969
If I wasn't your superior officer, would
I be saying any of this to you right now?

34:12.980 --> 34:15.830
If you weren't my superior officer, I'd
be pounding the shit out of your right now.

34:15.860 --> 34:19.090
That's the killer instinct
a good fighter needs.

34:19.110 --> 34:21.690
So what do you think, franc?

34:22.590 --> 34:23.850
Can I wear head gear?

34:23.860 --> 34:28.739
You can wear a dress and a jogging
bra for all I care.Just say yes.

34:28.760 --> 34:30.050
Yes.

34:32.380 --> 34:35.760
Yeah, I swear to god, guys, if good old
nielsy didn't cut the wheel and nail the brakes

34:35.780 --> 34:38.469
just at the right time,
there'd be like 4 people dead.

34:38.489 --> 34:40.380
Nielsy's one of the finest
wheel men on the job.

34:40.400 --> 34:43.020
Yeah, he's like B.J. And
the bear minus the monkey.

34:43.040 --> 34:44.820
I'd like to get a monkey.

34:44.840 --> 34:46.659
Man, I'd love to be a driver.

34:46.679 --> 34:48.940
Well, usually just
senior guys drive, kid.

34:48.960 --> 34:53.040
Now that there's so few of us left, newbies
can take the course in maybe 2 or 3 years.

34:53.060 --> 34:56.030
Oh, would that mean he wouldn't
have to go into the fire?

34:56.060 --> 34:58.600
That part of his job is a
little hard to get around.

34:58.620 --> 35:00.390
Well, it doesn't hurt to ask.

35:00.420 --> 35:04.060
Maybe once he graduates probie
school, I can put in a good word.

35:04.080 --> 35:06.050
Have him assigned to this house.

35:06.060 --> 35:07.190
Keep him in good hands.

35:07.210 --> 35:09.640
You, sidney, are too sweet.

35:09.670 --> 35:12.670
He's a good kid. Certainly
comes from fine stock.

35:12.690 --> 35:14.350
And you can call me sidney.

35:14.370 --> 35:16.930
I already did. How about
i call you big cutie?

35:16.950 --> 35:19.490
Like, big cutie, have some more treats.

35:19.760 --> 35:21.540
- Thank you.
- Hey, tom.

35:21.560 --> 35:23.260
Sheila brought us rice crispy treats.

35:24.070 --> 35:26.450
The guys are giving me a
little fire fighter tutorial.

35:26.470 --> 35:29.050
Damian wants to drive the
rig when he gets on the job.

35:29.070 --> 35:32.650
Why don't you graduate first before you
start picking out a goddamn locker, ok, punk.

35:32.670 --> 35:34.300
Come on, tommy, he's gonna graduate.

35:34.320 --> 35:37.920
Yeah, his instructor says that he's
already top of the class so far.

35:37.940 --> 35:39.330
What are you, 3 weeks in?

35:39.360 --> 35:41.750
Stretching hose and
doing physical training.

35:41.760 --> 35:45.920
Got some guy that used to look up to your old
man helping you put on your bunker gear every day.

35:45.940 --> 35:48.080
Wait till they stick your
narrow ass in the smokehouse, ok,

35:48.100 --> 35:51.530
or you're roasting at 1,500 degrees
in the goddamn flashover stimulator.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.050
Then we'll see how big your balls are.

35:53.070 --> 35:55.640
Hey, asshole. I'm sorry, big cutie.

35:55.660 --> 35:57.840
Listen, why don't you back off my son.

35:57.860 --> 36:00.990
Because this ain't goddamn
summer camp, ok, sweetie.

36:01.010 --> 36:02.480
And if I'm not mistaken, chief,

36:02.510 --> 36:05.020
isn't there a rule against
social calls in the firehouse?

36:05.040 --> 36:07.370
Don't be a stickler,
tommy. Here, have a treat.

36:07.400 --> 36:09.080
No thanks.

36:10.070 --> 36:11.830
Ok, duty calls.

36:11.860 --> 36:13.810
- Hey, can I ride along?
- No.

36:13.830 --> 36:16.050
Oh, come on, chief, let the
kid ride. It'll be good for him.

36:16.070 --> 36:19.360
- Only if his mother says it's ok.
- Uh, it's ok.

36:19.380 --> 36:21.460
You stay clear of the
action, ok? Understood?

36:21.480 --> 36:22.500
- Yeah, understood.
- Ok.

36:22.540 --> 36:24.580
- This is ridiculous.
- You, thank you very much for coming.

36:24.600 --> 36:27.330
- Come anytime you want.
- I will, I promise.

36:27.350 --> 36:30.230
I promise.

36:33.920 --> 36:35.080
Can I ride on the rig with you guys?

36:35.100 --> 36:36.680
Hey, chief, can the kid ride in the rig?

36:36.700 --> 36:37.840
Sure, go ahead.

36:37.860 --> 36:38.920
Bobby, you ride with me.

36:38.940 --> 36:40.150
Why do I got to ride in the suburban?

36:40.170 --> 36:42.030
'Cause I said so. Come
on, you big mutant.

36:42.050 --> 36:43.510
I thought you were
going over in that thing.

36:43.520 --> 36:45.330
No, I'm riding in the rig.
The chief said it's ok.

36:45.350 --> 36:47.840
Ok.Well, keep your hands to
yourself, don't touch anything hot.

36:47.860 --> 36:49.230
If your kid's in trouble,
I'm not looking out for him.

36:49.260 --> 36:50.810
He gets in trouble, mike's
gonna watch after him.

36:50.830 --> 36:52.880
Oh, really?I guess
he's in trouble already.

36:52.900 --> 36:55.240
Oh, whoa. What the hell is this?

36:55.260 --> 36:56.610
Did you ok this, chief?

36:56.620 --> 36:58.590
It's ok. Don't worry about it.

36:59.230 --> 37:02.020
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.820
Hey, check out salt
and pepper over there.

37:04.840 --> 37:06.620
Wouldn't mind those two on a sandwich.

37:20.690 --> 37:22.680
Almost never happens.

37:23.800 --> 37:26.260
You know that almost never happens.

37:26.750 --> 37:29.600
- Hey, where's garrity?
- He's got the flu.'

37:30.150 --> 37:32.650
Missing black shawn, now we're missing
white shawn. We're 2 shawns down.

37:32.670 --> 37:35.130
We had to take him to
the hospital.White shawn.

37:35.160 --> 37:37.260
- For the flu?
- He was pissing blood, dude.

37:37.270 --> 37:39.220
Nah, nah, you don't piss
blood when you got the flu.

37:39.240 --> 37:41.670
You piss blood when you got
something like gonorrhea.

37:41.690 --> 37:43.160
You do?

37:43.180 --> 37:45.340
Me?No.No, no, no. I never have.

37:45.360 --> 37:51.080
That's what I heard happens to people who
have gonorrhea, which I've never had.Obviously.

37:51.910 --> 37:53.310
I think he had gonorrhea.

37:53.330 --> 37:56.530
Once, ok. Jesus, just once.

37:57.710 --> 37:59.280
One and a half times.

37:59.310 --> 38:02.810
The second time doesn't count
because I was just a carrier.

38:13.920 --> 38:17.470
- Dude, that was awesome.
- Ahh, we did all right.

38:17.500 --> 38:20.410
The engine had a dry hydrant
which delayed our primary searches,

38:20.430 --> 38:23.900
which is why the chief had
to call a second alarm.but,

38:23.920 --> 38:26.130
most of the apartments
above were vacant,

38:26.160 --> 38:27.710
which is why we didn't find any roasts.

38:27.740 --> 38:29.730
- Roasts?
- Dead guys.

38:29.750 --> 38:31.660
Oh, yeah, roasts.

38:31.680 --> 38:34.830
Hey, let me get in there, you
know, check out the damage.

38:36.520 --> 38:37.920
No, I don't think so.

38:37.940 --> 38:40.070
Oh, come on, mike. Let me in there.

38:40.090 --> 38:44.030
I mean, the stimulator at
school, it's for pussies.

38:44.050 --> 38:46.640
Let me see what this
bitch can really do.

38:48.010 --> 38:50.830
All right. Here, suit up.

38:52.470 --> 38:57.250
Listen, whatever you do, keep
this mask on, you hear me?

38:57.270 --> 38:59.260
Because if you get in trouble,
then I get in big time trouble.

38:59.270 --> 39:01.500
- I'm not gonna get you in trouble.
- No, that's right.

39:01.510 --> 39:03.820
You're not going to get me in
trouble because if you get in trouble,

39:03.840 --> 39:05.160
then I'm going to get
in big time trouble.

39:05.180 --> 39:08.200
And if I get in big
time trouble, then you--

39:08.220 --> 39:09.860
what are we talking about?Let's go.

39:10.850 --> 39:11.950
It stinks in here.

39:11.970 --> 39:15.260
You'll get used to it.In fact, there will be
times you find yourself craving that stink,

39:15.290 --> 39:17.560
like it's a drug or
something. Watch your head.

39:17.580 --> 39:19.540
Usually a fire like this, it's either a

39:19.570 --> 39:22.090
torch job or it was
initiated by something stupid,

39:22.110 --> 39:27.110
you know, something small
like a cigarette or a candle.

39:27.120 --> 39:29.690
This burn, classic
case of jewish lighting.

39:29.720 --> 39:32.070
- What's that?
- Arson.

39:32.090 --> 39:33.950
Torch must have gassed the
shit out of the stairwell,

39:33.970 --> 39:35.770
because by the time we got here,

39:35.790 --> 39:40.630
all the floors were fully involved and the flame
was coming out through the bulkhead on the roof.

39:41.720 --> 39:44.580
- Where you going?
- Upper floors.

39:44.600 --> 39:48.070
- I don't know.
- What, you scared?

39:48.100 --> 39:50.400
- Kinda.
- Good.Let's go.

39:54.040 --> 39:57.800
So the engine will come in and do the
final douche once we open up the cockloft

39:57.810 --> 40:02.890
and check for any hidden flame,
then we could take up, head home, and

40:02.910 --> 40:04.140
get some r and R.

40:04.160 --> 40:06.350
Can we get a long island
iced tea after the shift?

40:06.370 --> 40:07.950
Hey, don't push your luck, buddy.

40:07.960 --> 40:09.490
Hey, tommy, want to join me up here?

40:09.510 --> 40:11.070
Shit. Come on.

40:11.620 --> 40:13.840
Here, get in here, and I'll
come back for you, all right.

40:13.860 --> 40:15.470
- Let me go talk to
these guys. - Wait, do--

40:15.490 --> 40:17.570
If anyone comes in, just act
like you're working or something.

40:17.590 --> 40:18.990
Wait, mike.

40:19.010 --> 40:20.400
Mikey, where are you?

40:20.430 --> 40:22.100
- Hey, what's up?
- Get over here, will you?

40:22.130 --> 40:23.910
I got too many irons.

40:23.930 --> 40:26.720
Go right over there, give
the ceiling a pull, will you?

40:26.740 --> 40:28.280
Ok, you got it.

40:28.300 --> 40:29.560
Hey, tom, you know what time it is?

40:29.580 --> 40:30.490
Uh, why?

40:30.510 --> 40:34.670
Oh, I was just wondering how long it was
since I reminded you that I banged frenchie.

40:41.040 --> 40:42.440
Shit.

40:44.100 --> 40:45.750
Mike!

40:46.500 --> 40:48.940
Chief, we've got a flare-up on
the top floor. We're coming down.

40:48.960 --> 40:50.350
- Let's go, guys.
- We can't go, guys.

40:50.370 --> 40:52.920
The floor's not clear.
There's somebody in there!

40:52.940 --> 40:55.040
- Who's in there?
- It doesn't matter who.

40:55.890 --> 40:57.980
- Who is it?
- It's damian.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.550
He wanted to go in, tom.

41:00.570 --> 41:02.280
You Moron!

41:03.690 --> 41:06.080
Get down the stairs. You moron.

41:07.130 --> 41:09.630
Mike!

41:11.170 --> 41:13.390
Tommy!

41:18.990 --> 41:20.420
Dammit.
