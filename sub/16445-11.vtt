WEBVTT

00:00.574 --> 00:03.785
- <i>Previously on</i> Gotham...
- My name is Volk. My brother Jacob.

00:03.816 --> 00:05.216
We are called the whisper gang.

00:05.251 --> 00:06.628
<i>Those men were
willing to kill for this key,</i>

00:06.652 --> 00:08.119
- <i>but what does it open?</i>
- A safe.

00:08.154 --> 00:10.821
<i>Inside, there is a device that
we believe can destroy them.</i>

00:10.857 --> 00:12.356
<i>They call themselves</i>

00:12.391 --> 00:14.191
the court of owls.

00:14.227 --> 00:16.327
Isabella was murdered.
Her brake lines were cut!

00:16.361 --> 00:17.362
<i>And I know who did it.</i>

00:17.396 --> 00:19.597
You can stop the blade
from being released.

00:19.632 --> 00:21.499
<i>If you click this button, it will send</i>

00:21.534 --> 00:23.100
<i>a fatal jolt to butch.</i>

00:23.136 --> 00:24.902
Hey, butch, you're sweet.

00:26.906 --> 00:28.672
- You really didn't kill her?
- No!

00:28.708 --> 00:30.941
- Guilty!
<i>- The lab analyzing</i>

00:30.977 --> 00:33.010
Alice Tetch's blood
has developed a test.

00:33.045 --> 00:34.879
- You're kidding.
- Don Falcone, please.

00:34.914 --> 00:37.481
<i>We'll pull your car around.</i>

00:37.517 --> 00:38.760
<i>Carmine's not the target.</i>

00:38.784 --> 00:40.451
You are. Get down!

00:43.756 --> 00:47.057
Why are you coming
after me?! You know why.

00:47.093 --> 00:48.626
Why are you trying to kill my son?

00:48.661 --> 00:51.328
We will expect your
assistance when called on.

00:51.364 --> 00:54.899
Until then, your son is
safe... at least from us.

00:54.934 --> 00:57.501
<i>Why does it feel
like we keep saying good-bye?</i>

00:57.537 --> 00:58.657
Maybe it's all we have left.

00:58.681 --> 01:00.729
Or we just haven't done it properly yet.

01:01.240 --> 01:02.706
Bye, James Gordon.

01:02.742 --> 01:04.720
<i>She loves him, she loves him...</i>

01:04.744 --> 01:07.511
You lost?

01:07.547 --> 01:11.415
She loves me...!

01:26.299 --> 01:27.831
Hey.

01:47.453 --> 01:48.986
I'm getting married tomorrow.

01:49.021 --> 01:50.221
Congratulations.

01:50.256 --> 01:53.557
People always talk about
love at first sight.

01:53.593 --> 01:55.593
I never believed it.

01:55.628 --> 01:59.363
But the moment I saw her, I knew.

01:59.398 --> 02:00.831
Yeah.

02:00.866 --> 02:03.834
So, what do you do?

02:03.869 --> 02:05.536
I'm a hematologist.

02:05.571 --> 02:06.937
At Gotham bio-lab.

02:08.003 --> 02:10.139
You aren't working on that blood virus,

02:10.175 --> 02:11.742
are you, from, um...

02:11.777 --> 02:14.011
What's her name? Tetch?

02:14.046 --> 02:16.847
Alice Tetch?

02:16.882 --> 02:20.251
Uh, my fiancÃ©e is with
the police department.

02:20.286 --> 02:22.119
She's the medical examiner on the case.

02:22.154 --> 02:23.621
Oh. Yes.

02:23.656 --> 02:24.955
She said

02:24.991 --> 02:27.891
you had come up with
a test for the virus.

02:27.927 --> 02:30.728
I really can't talk about it.

02:33.811 --> 02:36.194
She almost married someone else.

02:37.372 --> 02:40.271
I think her ex still hopes she'll come

02:40.306 --> 02:42.606
running back.

02:42.642 --> 02:44.642
Not gonna happen.

02:49.582 --> 02:52.149
<i>She loves him.</i>

02:52.184 --> 02:55.119
<i>She loves him. She loves him.</i>

02:55.154 --> 02:56.220
Do you hear me, Jim?

02:57.223 --> 02:59.623
I won't let you have her!

03:15.808 --> 03:16.974
Volk is dead?

03:17.009 --> 03:18.375
We found his and Dmitri's bodies

03:18.411 --> 03:20.044
early this morning.

03:20.079 --> 03:22.112
They were killed talon,
the court's assassin.

03:22.148 --> 03:24.281
Well, that certainly changes
things a bit, doesn't it?

03:24.317 --> 03:27.451
How? You possess the key.
The key opens the safe.

03:27.486 --> 03:28.819
Inside the safe is an object

03:28.854 --> 03:30.454
that can bring down the court of owls.

03:30.489 --> 03:31.822
None of this has changed.

03:36.362 --> 03:38.329
If this assassin
saw us with Volk...

03:38.364 --> 03:39.574
That means the court already knows

03:39.598 --> 03:41.613
that you're breaking
your deal, master Bruce.

03:41.650 --> 03:43.300
I wish we knew for certain.

03:43.336 --> 03:45.369
Yeah, well, I wish we knew
for certain what was in

03:45.404 --> 03:47.382
that blinking safe or how
far we can trust this little

03:47.406 --> 03:49.306
whisper gang front.

03:49.342 --> 03:51.575
Ask yourself this:

03:51.610 --> 03:54.845
Is bringing down the court
really worth the risk?

03:59.919 --> 04:02.853
The court of owls has
taken over my company,

04:02.888 --> 04:04.855
threatened people I care about,

04:04.890 --> 04:06.957
and is likely responsible
for my parents' deaths.

04:08.361 --> 04:10.094
What's our next step?

04:17.036 --> 04:19.570
I'm giving this one to Alvarez.

04:19.605 --> 04:20.671
No.

04:20.706 --> 04:22.250
I told you to take the day off.

04:22.274 --> 04:23.674
I know.

04:23.709 --> 04:25.876
You do know I'm acting
captain now, right?

04:25.911 --> 04:27.444
Yeah.

04:27.480 --> 04:28.957
Jim, there will be another
dead body tomorrow.

04:28.981 --> 04:31.515
Seriously, take the day.
Go fishing, get drunk.

04:31.550 --> 04:33.016
Harvey, this is my job.

04:33.052 --> 04:35.219
Lee getting married doesn't change that.

04:35.254 --> 04:37.121
Take a look at this guy's head.

04:37.156 --> 04:40.023
Whoa. What's that coming out of his ear?

04:40.059 --> 04:42.192
His skull was crushed.

04:42.228 --> 04:44.928
Like someone squeezed
it from either side.

04:44.964 --> 04:47.064
Can you imagine the
strength needed to do that?

04:47.099 --> 04:49.733
I got to tell you, my first thought...

04:49.769 --> 04:50.769
- Oh, no.
- Barnes.

04:50.803 --> 04:51.869
Stop it!

04:51.904 --> 04:53.871
Barnes had the virus. He's at Arkham.

04:53.906 --> 04:56.140
That story's over. This
is what I was afraid of.

04:56.175 --> 04:58.409
Wallet's here, but the killer
took a badge or something

04:58.444 --> 04:59.810
from around his neck.

04:59.845 --> 05:01.045
Your emotions are all stirred.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.391
You're seeing things
that aren't really there.

05:02.415 --> 05:05.382
This is just a classic case
of wrong place, wrong time.

05:05.418 --> 05:06.950
One man takes another man's skull

05:06.986 --> 05:08.385
in his bare hands and crushes it.

05:08.421 --> 05:09.953
I see it all the time.

05:09.989 --> 05:12.423
Receipt... from the cafeteria

05:12.458 --> 05:14.391
at Gotham bio-lab, where
Alice Tetch's blood

05:14.427 --> 05:15.959
is being tested.

05:15.995 --> 05:18.061
- Crap.
- I'm gonna swing by.

05:18.097 --> 05:19.263
Finish up here, will you?

05:19.298 --> 05:22.266
Sure, Jim. happy to oblige.

05:23.936 --> 05:26.194
No rest for the wicked.

05:26.639 --> 05:28.572
Relax.

05:28.607 --> 05:31.074
I'm not here to get revenge

05:31.110 --> 05:33.110
for you lopping off tabby's paw.

05:33.145 --> 05:34.678
Though I am surprised to find you

05:34.713 --> 05:37.347
back at work and not
tracking down who really did

05:37.383 --> 05:38.849
kill your lady love.

05:38.884 --> 05:41.118
That's because you don't
see the full picture.

05:41.921 --> 05:43.854
The mayor has many enemies.

05:43.889 --> 05:45.033
These enemies understand that I am

05:45.057 --> 05:46.435
a fundamental part of this operation.

05:46.459 --> 05:48.425
They weaken me, they weaken him.

05:48.461 --> 05:51.128
That was clearly the
intent of killing Isabella.

05:51.163 --> 05:53.530
Also, I have spies

05:53.566 --> 05:55.299
all over this city.

05:55.334 --> 05:57.000
Soon enough, whoever killed Isabella

05:57.036 --> 05:58.802
will reveal themselves,

05:58.838 --> 06:01.205
and I will strike.

06:02.241 --> 06:04.224
Poor blind baby.

06:05.411 --> 06:09.872
It's always hardest to see
what's right under our noses.

06:11.684 --> 06:13.851
Penguin!

06:18.196 --> 06:20.280
Did you just fake cough "penguin"?

06:21.093 --> 06:23.193
Needless to say,

06:23.229 --> 06:26.196
that is... absurd on a number of levels.

06:26.232 --> 06:28.065
Really?

06:28.100 --> 06:31.535
All a crime requires is
means, motive and opportunity.

06:31.570 --> 06:33.003
And your beaky little buddy

06:33.038 --> 06:35.706
certainly has the means and opportunity.

06:35.741 --> 06:37.341
But no motive.

06:37.376 --> 06:40.977
Oh, I would say he had the
oldest motive in the book.

06:41.714 --> 06:43.046
"Rich men want it,

06:43.082 --> 06:45.816
wise men know it, the
poor all need it..."

06:45.851 --> 06:48.552
Love. What does that have to do...

06:52.124 --> 06:55.025
And the penny... drops.

07:00.766 --> 07:03.300
You are suggesting...

07:03.335 --> 07:06.470
That Oswald...

07:06.505 --> 07:08.372
Is in love with me?

07:09.942 --> 07:12.075
- That is ridiculous.
- I know. I mean,

07:12.111 --> 07:15.012
personally, I find you a
bit of a cold fish, but...

07:15.047 --> 07:19.016
Ozzie saw you being taken away
from him by that bookish ViXen,

07:19.051 --> 07:20.517
and...

07:24.156 --> 07:26.557
Aah... oh, no!

07:28.928 --> 07:29.960
Hmm.

07:29.995 --> 07:32.129
No.

07:32.164 --> 07:35.866
In fact, I'm beginning to wonder
what your motive is in all this.

07:35.901 --> 07:38.435
That's for later.

07:38.470 --> 07:40.003
Right now,

07:40.039 --> 07:44.942
I... just want to see
justice for that poor,

07:44.977 --> 07:46.910
sweet girl.

07:46.946 --> 07:48.545
Ms. Kean,

07:48.581 --> 07:51.615
I need you to understand two things.

07:51.650 --> 07:53.083
One,

07:53.118 --> 07:55.786
Oswald did not kill Isabella;

07:55.821 --> 07:59.222
and two, he's not in love with me.

08:03.395 --> 08:05.191
Are you so certain?

08:06.097 --> 08:08.765
Don't you owe it to her to find out?

08:10.903 --> 08:12.402
Let me know how it goes.

08:16.609 --> 08:18.787
The court of owls maintains
a number of buildings in Gotham.

08:18.811 --> 08:20.777
This one is rarely occupied

08:20.813 --> 08:24.055
and always well guarded,
and there are two alarms.

08:24.092 --> 08:25.749
The first covers points of entry.

08:25.784 --> 08:27.985
Last week, we managed to
disarm one of the windows.

08:28.020 --> 08:30.153
Once inside, the front door
can be opened using a code

08:30.189 --> 08:31.555
that we possess.

08:31.590 --> 08:34.091
The second alarm is in the basement.

08:34.126 --> 08:35.792
<i>In the room with the safe.</i>

08:35.828 --> 08:38.495
<i>The floor is fitted
with infrared sensors.</i>

08:38.530 --> 08:40.097
You must cross it on a rope.

08:41.567 --> 08:43.366
I have trained for this.

08:43.402 --> 08:44.512
You will give me the key you found,

08:44.536 --> 08:45.802
and I will retrieve the object.

08:45.838 --> 08:48.605
But you still don't know
what the object is, right?

08:48.641 --> 08:51.742
Only that the court
protects it, fears it.

08:51.777 --> 08:54.678
And that with talon hunting
us, we have no time.

09:00.719 --> 09:02.452
Right, so...

09:02.488 --> 09:03.754
Let's go through this again.

09:03.789 --> 09:04.855
What'd you decide?

09:04.890 --> 09:07.391
We're gonna break in today.

09:07.426 --> 09:09.026
We can't wait any longer.

09:11.196 --> 09:13.196
- You okay?
- Fine.

09:13.232 --> 09:14.965
Just hungry.

09:18.570 --> 09:20.470
<i>Gcpd.</i>

09:21.840 --> 09:24.141
Guy named Ryan Pfeffer work here?

09:24.176 --> 09:26.810
Uh, yeah.

09:26.845 --> 09:28.111
It's, uh, sub-level three.

09:28.147 --> 09:30.180
- What, he in trouble?
- He was killed last night.

09:30.215 --> 09:32.115
I need to talk to his colleagues.

09:32.151 --> 09:33.862
You guys keep track of
when key cards are used?

09:33.886 --> 09:35.085
Uh, yeah.

09:35.120 --> 09:36.319
All right.

09:36.355 --> 09:38.488
If anybody uses his, call me.

09:38.524 --> 09:41.391
Sure, but... his was
used 20 minutes ago.

09:42.327 --> 09:44.027
He hasn't logged out.

09:44.063 --> 09:45.829
Call the police. Now.

10:15.561 --> 10:16.727
Jim, Jim.

10:16.762 --> 10:18.228
You're ahead of schedule.

10:18.263 --> 10:21.698
Our paths weren't meant
to cross just yet.

10:25.437 --> 10:27.771
But I'm not gonna kill you yet.

10:27.806 --> 10:29.206
I do that,

10:29.241 --> 10:30.741
you become the martyr,

10:30.776 --> 10:33.243
and she'll carry you
in her heart forever.

10:33.278 --> 10:35.445
No. Before I kill you,

10:35.481 --> 10:38.582
she has to hate you.

10:38.617 --> 10:39.916
And she will.

10:44.323 --> 10:45.956
Come find me, Jim.

10:52.598 --> 10:55.552
So you didn't get a look
at the guy, and he's not

10:55.589 --> 10:57.650
on the cameras. We might get
something off the prints, but...

10:57.674 --> 11:00.809
Doubtful, if he was smart enough
to avoid the cameras. I'm good.

11:00.844 --> 11:02.589
He seems to have been
interested in the research

11:02.613 --> 11:04.079
into Alice Tetch's blood.

11:04.114 --> 11:06.748
Pfeffer's office was ransacked,
and the files were missing.

11:06.783 --> 11:09.417
So someone else is infected with
the virus? That's just great.

11:09.453 --> 11:10.518
It isn't you, is it?

11:10.554 --> 11:12.654
Because that sure
would make things easy.

11:12.689 --> 11:15.601
No, it's not me. What's
that on your hand?

11:15.893 --> 11:17.425
"Arkham."

11:17.461 --> 11:19.227
I didn't write it.

11:19.263 --> 11:20.440
Okay, let's all just calm down.

11:20.464 --> 11:22.697
So the virus-infected
killer wrote on your hand.

11:22.733 --> 11:24.933
He wants you to go to Arkham.

11:24.968 --> 11:26.067
Barnes is in Arkham.

11:26.103 --> 11:27.335
No.

11:27.371 --> 11:28.937
It's not about Barnes.

11:29.940 --> 11:32.274
- Jim, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

11:39.549 --> 11:41.283
Hello, Jervis.

11:41.318 --> 11:43.151
James.

11:43.186 --> 11:45.186
What an unexpected pleasure.

11:47.591 --> 11:50.225
Someone else is infected
with your sister's blood.

11:50.260 --> 11:51.626
You don't say.

11:51.662 --> 11:54.562
And I've been thinking it's possible

11:54.598 --> 11:56.464
she infected them accidentally.

11:56.500 --> 12:00.201
Yes, possible. Possible.

12:00.237 --> 12:03.138
But your reaction tells
me you knew. So...

12:03.173 --> 12:05.140
You infected them after you stole

12:05.175 --> 12:09.086
your sister's blood,
but you stayed quiet,

12:09.508 --> 12:11.332
waiting for them to show symptoms.

12:11.370 --> 12:15.050
Well, that would be darn
sneaky of me, wouldn't it?

12:15.085 --> 12:16.418
I need the name.

12:16.453 --> 12:17.652
Oh.

12:18.689 --> 12:21.523
You need the name.

12:21.558 --> 12:24.526
So... I've been quiet
about it all this time,

12:24.561 --> 12:28.730
and now I'm going to help you
because we're such good friends?

12:28.765 --> 12:31.833
Because I can make your life
here very uncomfortable.

12:31.868 --> 12:34.235
More uncomfortable than having
captain Barnes next door

12:34.271 --> 12:37.301
screaming "guilty!"
All hours of the night?

12:37.351 --> 12:38.673
Give me the name!

12:38.709 --> 12:40.508
Oh, James,

12:40.544 --> 12:44.346
I would love to see what
Alice's virus would do to you.

12:44.381 --> 12:47.782
The beast in you is right there.

12:47.818 --> 12:49.884
So desperate to get out.

12:53.061 --> 12:54.756
And I know of whom you speak.

12:54.791 --> 12:56.825
Oh, yes, indeed.

12:56.860 --> 12:59.828
I stabbed him and pricked
him and caused him to bleed.

12:59.863 --> 13:02.530
But nothing you can say,
no words you might possess,

13:02.566 --> 13:04.766
can pry from me the smallest guess,

13:04.801 --> 13:07.502
for this game is <i> my</i> game!

13:07.537 --> 13:09.437
I say when it's done.

13:09.473 --> 13:12.574
And right now I'm having too much fun.

13:14.644 --> 13:16.611
You want to play a game, Jervis?

13:16.646 --> 13:19.180
Fine. Let's play a game.

13:20.417 --> 13:23.284
Whoever you infected...

13:23.320 --> 13:26.287
Has some sort of plan.

13:26.323 --> 13:29.441
I want you to tell me
the name of this man.

13:30.527 --> 13:32.527
Wow, James, I...

13:32.562 --> 13:35.663
Have to give that effort an "f."

13:35.699 --> 13:37.565
And can you really imagine that...

13:37.601 --> 13:39.534
Two are dead.

13:39.569 --> 13:41.336
More may die soon.

13:41.371 --> 13:43.905
This isn't a game. Give me his name.

13:43.940 --> 13:45.807
You will only know his
name when it's too late!

13:45.842 --> 13:47.876
When the one you love has
been murdered by hate!

13:48.945 --> 13:51.079
Guard! Take me to my cell!

13:51.114 --> 13:52.892
- What do you mean the one that I love?
- Guard!

13:52.916 --> 13:54.149
Give me his name, Tetch.

13:54.184 --> 13:55.984
Give me his name or
you'll share the blame!

13:56.019 --> 13:57.563
Nothing! Nothing! I'll tell you naught!

13:57.587 --> 13:59.032
His name shall be neither
spoken nor taught.

13:59.056 --> 14:00.056
He'll cut and he'll crush

14:00.090 --> 14:01.356
and the blood will run thick.

14:01.391 --> 14:03.591
Though from healer to
killer is no easy trick.

14:05.195 --> 14:07.762
"Healer to killer."

14:07.798 --> 14:10.131
He's a doctor.

14:10.699 --> 14:11.699
My god.

14:11.735 --> 14:12.901
You'll never stop him, James.

14:12.936 --> 14:14.803
He'll kill and he'll kill

14:14.838 --> 14:16.182
- and he'll kill!
- This is Gordon.

14:16.206 --> 14:18.039
Give me Dr. Mario Calvi immediately.

14:18.075 --> 14:19.441
On my damn authority!

14:19.476 --> 14:22.110
Just do it!

14:33.557 --> 14:36.091
I take it you're off?

14:37.761 --> 14:40.428
When we were casing that place,

14:40.464 --> 14:42.464
I got a feeling we were being watched.

14:43.733 --> 14:45.867
And if this court of
owls is all you say,

14:45.902 --> 14:48.736
they're not gonna be too cool
with Bruce breaking their deal.

14:48.772 --> 14:51.306
That's very true.

14:51.341 --> 14:53.908
And master Bruce knows the court

14:53.944 --> 14:56.478
will catch up with him sooner or later.

14:56.513 --> 14:58.257
And if he has the
opportunity to take them out,

14:58.281 --> 14:59.247
then he'll take them out.

14:59.282 --> 15:00.548
That's a big if.

15:00.584 --> 15:02.217
Especially when your stupid job

15:02.252 --> 15:03.496
is supposed to be protecting him.

15:03.520 --> 15:06.254
My stupid job, miss, is to
make sure that he grows up

15:06.289 --> 15:08.990
to be the man he's meant to be.

15:09.025 --> 15:11.559
Still...

15:11.595 --> 15:13.328
Kind of a punk move for him

15:13.363 --> 15:15.930
to make a deal with the
people who killed his parents.

15:15.966 --> 15:17.486
Yeah, well, you understand this, then.

15:19.102 --> 15:20.468
He only did what he did

15:20.504 --> 15:22.537
to protect the people he cares about.

15:22.572 --> 15:24.572
For you.

15:26.143 --> 15:28.443
And it cost him dearly.

15:34.885 --> 15:37.252
Are you serious?
Arresting don Falcone's son

15:37.287 --> 15:39.420
- on his wedding day?
- I had no choice.

15:39.456 --> 15:40.456
He's got the virus.

15:40.490 --> 15:41.930
Do you really think Lee Thompkins...

15:41.958 --> 15:43.358
Dr. Lee Thompkins...

15:43.393 --> 15:45.293
Wouldn't know if her own
fiancÃ© had the virus?

15:45.328 --> 15:47.762
How long did Barnes have it and hide it?

15:47.797 --> 15:49.942
Tetch must have infected him
that night in the hospital

15:49.966 --> 15:51.511
when he dosed me; It
would explain things.

15:51.535 --> 15:52.535
Like what?

15:52.569 --> 15:54.536
Mario hitting me at
the engagement party.

15:54.571 --> 15:56.437
You know what also would explain that?

15:56.473 --> 15:58.806
You telling Tetch to shoot his fiancÃ©e.

15:58.842 --> 16:00.008
You should've seen his face

16:00.043 --> 16:01.654
when those assassins
attacked us... his rage.

16:01.678 --> 16:03.055
He was being attacked by assassins!

16:03.079 --> 16:04.646
What was I supposed to do, Harvey,

16:04.681 --> 16:06.648
wait until he kills
again, till he hurts Lee?

16:06.683 --> 16:09.050
You were supposed to wait
until you had enough proof.

16:09.085 --> 16:11.286
And why would Tetch infect
Mario in the first place?

16:11.321 --> 16:13.121
To hurt me.

16:13.156 --> 16:14.489
Okay, let's say you're right.

16:14.524 --> 16:16.357
Let's say that Mario is infected.

16:16.393 --> 16:19.327
So he crushes some guy's
skull, he breaks into the lab,

16:19.362 --> 16:22.697
he attacks you, and then he
writes "Arkham" on your hand?

16:22.732 --> 16:25.700
Why would he want you to find him?

16:25.735 --> 16:27.335
I don't know.

16:29.005 --> 16:31.039
He doesn't have the virus.

16:31.074 --> 16:32.907
What? No, no, no, no. Run it again.

16:32.943 --> 16:33.908
I ran it three times.

16:33.944 --> 16:35.243
He's clean.

16:35.278 --> 16:37.011
I could've told you that.

16:37.047 --> 16:38.413
But, hey, I'm glad it's official.

16:38.448 --> 16:40.848
Dr. Calvi,
on behalf of the gcpd,

16:40.884 --> 16:43.251
I just want to apologize for any...

16:43.286 --> 16:45.853
Inconvenience or embarrassment
this may have caused you.

16:45.889 --> 16:47.155
No need.

16:47.190 --> 16:48.990
Living with Lee, I
understand the pressures

16:49.025 --> 16:51.092
you're all under. But
if you'll excuse me,

16:51.127 --> 16:52.860
I have a wedding to attend.

16:52.896 --> 16:55.263
Jim, I understand

16:55.298 --> 16:59.033
this is a tough day for you,
but... no hard feelings.

16:59.069 --> 17:01.169
The test. That's why
you broke into the lab.

17:01.204 --> 17:02.737
To find out how to beat it.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.038
- But why?
- Jim...

17:04.074 --> 17:05.607
I know you have the virus.

17:05.642 --> 17:06.741
I'm gonna prove it.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.776
And I promise, you will never marry Lee.

17:14.903 --> 17:15.983
But she didn't say anything?

17:16.008 --> 17:19.041
She said she thought
we were being watched.

17:19.078 --> 17:22.079
Personally, I think sh-she's
just got the jitters.

17:23.069 --> 17:25.704
She can't still be mad I told
Ivy she was my girlfriend.

17:25.739 --> 17:27.239
Oh.

17:27.273 --> 17:28.607
It just slipped out.

17:28.642 --> 17:30.186
She can call herself whatever she wants.

17:30.210 --> 17:31.877
Fascinating as I find this tale of young

17:31.912 --> 17:33.278
unrequited love is, master Bruce,

17:33.314 --> 17:36.815
please can we just concentrate
on the task at hand?

17:36.850 --> 17:38.216
Do you have the key?

17:38.837 --> 17:40.585
Excellent.

17:40.621 --> 17:42.654
Alfred, you know when we get this thing,

17:42.690 --> 17:44.122
whatever it is...

17:44.158 --> 17:46.358
The whispers <i> are</i> gonna
try to take it from us.

17:46.393 --> 17:49.461
Well, to be honest, master Bruce,

17:49.496 --> 17:51.229
it's not the whispers I'm worried about.

18:08.615 --> 18:10.816
<i>And have we made any headway</i>

18:10.851 --> 18:12.117
on the waterfront negotiations?

18:12.152 --> 18:14.219
I have spoken with the union leader.

18:14.254 --> 18:15.620
He agreed to our offer.

18:15.656 --> 18:18.390
So those photos can
go back in the vault.

18:18.425 --> 18:20.492
They were quite saucy, weren't they?

18:20.527 --> 18:21.994
And how about the...

18:22.029 --> 18:24.730
Your approval for the new casino
should come through tomorrow.

18:24.765 --> 18:26.665
Demolition can begin right away.

18:26.700 --> 18:29.334
Ed, I cannot tell you
how good it is to see you

18:29.370 --> 18:30.736
back to your old self.

18:32.006 --> 18:34.239
Just one last signature.

18:38.112 --> 18:40.379
This is your resignation.

18:40.414 --> 18:43.548
Isabella's death has altered things,

18:43.584 --> 18:45.250
and I can't continue... no!

18:45.285 --> 18:47.444
Ed, I will not let you leave.

18:49.690 --> 18:52.557
It is not in your best interest.

18:52.593 --> 18:54.526
You have to stay busy.

18:58.032 --> 19:00.198
How can I say this? Um...

19:01.969 --> 19:03.702
We're friends.

19:05.472 --> 19:07.439
Aren't we, Oswald?

19:07.474 --> 19:09.608
Of course!

19:09.643 --> 19:12.210
Since the accident...

19:12.246 --> 19:15.380
And-and I never thought
that this could happen...

19:17.937 --> 19:20.018
I've had the desire to

19:20.054 --> 19:22.921
become more than employer-employee.

19:25.259 --> 19:26.725
More than friends.

19:31.098 --> 19:32.898
I have been feeling the same.

19:32.933 --> 19:35.233
I didn't want to mention it,

19:35.269 --> 19:37.602
because of all the
awfulness about Isabelle.

19:37.638 --> 19:39.371
Isabella!

19:39.406 --> 19:40.572
But...

19:43.844 --> 19:45.911
One cannot deny love.

19:48.282 --> 19:50.816
Wh-what is it? Wh-what's wrong?

19:52.252 --> 19:55.120
There...

19:55.155 --> 19:56.922
There's been a misunderstanding.

19:56.957 --> 19:59.157
I was going to...

19:59.193 --> 20:02.094
Propose that we become partners.

20:03.630 --> 20:05.297
Business partners.

20:05.332 --> 20:08.467
Partners?

20:08.502 --> 20:09.801
Then...

20:09.837 --> 20:11.603
Excuse me.

20:19.446 --> 20:20.779
Lee? You here? It's Jim!

20:20.814 --> 20:22.414
Hello, Jim.

20:22.449 --> 20:24.616
I saw you left Lee a message.

20:24.651 --> 20:27.452
I, uh, accidentally took
her phone this morning.

20:27.488 --> 20:29.921
She's not here, by the way.

20:29.957 --> 20:30.989
- Drink?
- No, thanks.

20:31.024 --> 20:33.492
How'd you pass the test?

20:35.996 --> 20:38.430
Because I don't have the virus.

20:38.465 --> 20:40.332
Or do I?

20:43.237 --> 20:45.537
You gonna arrest me, Jim?

20:45.572 --> 20:48.206
Do you want to look even more
like the paranoid ex-lover?

20:48.242 --> 20:50.609
I'll only pass the test again.

20:50.644 --> 20:52.210
We'll find out how you beat it.

20:52.246 --> 20:54.157
Only a matter of time.

20:54.777 --> 20:56.715
Let's say I do have tirus

20:56.750 --> 20:58.150
how would I have gotten it?

20:58.185 --> 20:59.618
From Tet.

21:01.755 --> 21:05.557
<i>Dr. Calvi, I'd
like you to meet my sister,</i>

21:05.592 --> 21:06.992
<i>Alice.</i>

21:07.027 --> 21:09.194
With Barnes...

21:09.229 --> 21:12.564
The virus stoked his
anger at the guilty.

21:12.599 --> 21:14.799
What dark part of me
has it brought to life?

21:14.835 --> 21:17.235
Jealousy.

21:17.271 --> 21:19.404
You're afraid of losing Lee.

21:19.439 --> 21:21.773
If that's true...

21:21.808 --> 21:25.410
That means the woman we
both know you still love

21:25.445 --> 21:29.748
is gonna marry a lunatic
who'll do anything to keep her.

21:29.783 --> 21:32.050
Are you sure you don't want that drink?

21:32.085 --> 21:34.152
What I want to know is why you put me

21:34.188 --> 21:35.554
on your trail.

21:35.589 --> 21:37.155
What are you after?

21:37.191 --> 21:38.823
Let me give you a hint.

21:38.859 --> 21:41.760
You see, what keeps me up at night

21:41.795 --> 21:45.096
is not the thought that you love her.

21:45.132 --> 21:46.898
It's the thought...

21:46.934 --> 21:49.301
That a part of her still loves you.

21:50.370 --> 21:53.471
Well, in that case, let's find her.

21:53.507 --> 21:56.007
Let her decide if she's gonna marry you.

21:57.711 --> 22:00.145
Yeah, I don't think so.

22:03.817 --> 22:06.151
Virus made you strong, not bulletproof.

22:06.186 --> 22:07.385
Let's go.

22:07.421 --> 22:08.831
You know what, Jim, with
all this virus talk,

22:08.855 --> 22:10.388
you keep forgetting one thing.

22:10.424 --> 22:13.391
I'm still carmine Falcone's son.

22:14.428 --> 22:16.453
You know Victor.

22:19.166 --> 22:20.532
Hi-ho.

22:27.004 --> 22:29.312
Victor, were
you listening to him?

22:29.362 --> 22:31.095
He has the same virus as Barnes had.

22:31.131 --> 22:32.463
What's that?

22:32.499 --> 22:34.932
Oh, no. I wasn't listening.

22:34.968 --> 22:36.634
- You have to let me go.
- Uh-huh.

22:37.937 --> 22:39.482
- Does Falcone know you're here?
- Wait.

22:39.506 --> 22:41.906
Wait.

22:45.011 --> 22:46.844
You're free to go, Jim.

22:49.415 --> 22:50.748
I'll keep this.

22:51.785 --> 22:53.518
I don't understand.

22:53.553 --> 22:54.852
I was only supposed to keep you

22:54.888 --> 22:57.655
until the big hand was on
nine and the little hand...

22:57.690 --> 22:59.257
My mag... now.

22:59.292 --> 23:02.660
Sorry, Jim. But, hey, give
the bride a kiss for me.

23:04.164 --> 23:06.164
I asked.

23:11.571 --> 23:12.804
And it is with great pleasure

23:12.839 --> 23:15.873
that I present this
award to Mr. Kyle Davis

23:15.909 --> 23:19.010
for his magnificent book,

23:19.045 --> 23:21.879
<i>An oral history.</i>

23:21.915 --> 23:24.482
Looks just fascinating.

23:26.152 --> 23:27.485
Thank you.

23:27.520 --> 23:29.153
Oh, you're too kind.

23:29.189 --> 23:31.222
I love sewers.

23:45.505 --> 23:47.939
Ed.

23:47.974 --> 23:50.441
I was worried when you ran off

23:50.476 --> 23:52.777
that I might have upset you.

23:54.614 --> 23:57.081
Can't we just pretend
that nothing happened?

23:57.116 --> 23:59.116
Go back to the way things were?

24:04.290 --> 24:07.992
You are the best friend I've ever had.

24:08.027 --> 24:10.127
I don't want to lose you.

24:12.265 --> 24:13.764
Please?

24:16.903 --> 24:18.669
You're my best friend as well, Oswald.

24:21.608 --> 24:23.608
Remember that.

24:40.827 --> 24:42.860
Jim, what are you doing here?

24:42.896 --> 24:44.373
Are you okay?

24:44.898 --> 24:46.264
Where's Mario?

24:46.299 --> 24:49.138
He's out at the church.
We're about to get married.

24:50.069 --> 24:51.402
You can't marry him.

24:51.437 --> 24:53.504
Oh, my god.

24:53.539 --> 24:56.440
- Just give us a minute.
- Yeah.

25:05.618 --> 25:06.717
Listen to me,

25:06.753 --> 25:08.486
and I know how this is gonna sound...

25:08.521 --> 25:11.255
You think that he has
Alice Tetch's virus.

25:11.291 --> 25:13.624
- He told you.
- Yes.

25:13.660 --> 25:15.826
And he told me that you
had him arrested today,

25:15.862 --> 25:17.528
on our wedding day.

25:17.563 --> 25:20.264
And you had Lucius give him the
test three times, and he passed.

25:20.300 --> 25:21.365
What's wrong with you?

25:21.401 --> 25:23.534
He cheated the test, Lee.

25:23.569 --> 25:25.136
I don't know how, but he did.

25:25.171 --> 25:27.405
Tetch infected him that
night in the hospital.

25:27.440 --> 25:28.940
You went to see Tetch, didn't you?

25:28.975 --> 25:30.474
- Yes.
- Jim,

25:30.510 --> 25:31.676
don't you see?

25:31.711 --> 25:33.644
Tetch is planting ideas in your head.

25:33.680 --> 25:34.779
- No.
- Don't you remember?

25:34.814 --> 25:35.680
He's done this before.

25:35.715 --> 25:37.181
No, this isn't like that.

25:37.216 --> 25:39.884
Okay, what is more likely,
that Tetch is planting ideas

25:39.919 --> 25:42.086
in your head to screw
with you or that Mario

25:42.121 --> 25:43.421
has Alice's virus?

25:43.456 --> 25:45.589
Lee, you cannot marry him!

25:46.993 --> 25:49.961
Mario said that you would
never let us be happy.

25:49.996 --> 25:52.863
I thought he was
overreacting, but he's right.

25:52.899 --> 25:57.068
Tetch or not, you are obsessed.

25:57.103 --> 25:58.602
Let it go.

26:00.773 --> 26:02.173
This is what he wanted.

26:02.208 --> 26:03.841
- What are you talking about?
- This.

26:03.876 --> 26:06.410
Me coming here.

26:06.446 --> 26:08.379
That's why he put me on his trail.

26:08.414 --> 26:12.683
He got the test so he could
find out how to beat it.

26:12.719 --> 26:16.787
He had me arrest him so
I'd look like a jealous ex.

26:16.823 --> 26:20.057
That's why Zsasz let me
go, so I'd race here...

26:21.561 --> 26:23.494
Finally push you away.

26:23.529 --> 26:25.229
Oh, Jim.

26:25.264 --> 26:27.298
I say this as someone

26:27.333 --> 26:29.700
who cares about you.

26:29.736 --> 26:31.969
Get help.

26:37.477 --> 26:39.677
I love you.

26:44.584 --> 26:46.917
I love you.

26:46.953 --> 26:48.185
I've never stopped.

26:49.722 --> 26:52.256
I should've come to see you as
soon as I got out of prison,

26:52.291 --> 26:54.325
but I couldn't.

26:54.360 --> 26:55.860
I was ashamed.

26:57.096 --> 26:59.663
I thought I had to set things right.

26:59.699 --> 27:01.766
But I did finally come,

27:01.801 --> 27:03.200
Lee.

27:05.204 --> 27:07.171
I saw you,

27:07.206 --> 27:10.241
through the window, with him.

27:10.276 --> 27:12.243
You were smiling.

27:12.278 --> 27:13.778
You looked happy.

27:16.949 --> 27:18.716
I couldn't bring myself to go in.

27:18.751 --> 27:22.186
I've regretted it every day since.

27:22.221 --> 27:24.221
Please.

27:27.994 --> 27:29.093
Don't marry him.

27:37.170 --> 27:39.136
After the wedding...

27:40.940 --> 27:43.274
Mario and I are leaving Gotham.

27:43.309 --> 27:46.410
I'll never see you again.

27:46.446 --> 27:48.946
- Lee...
- Damn you...

27:48.981 --> 27:52.750
For telling me this now.

27:52.785 --> 27:54.985
You come in here with
these crazy accusations,

27:55.021 --> 27:57.321
and when I don't believe
you, you pull this?

27:58.591 --> 28:00.591
How dare you?!

28:04.430 --> 28:06.430
Don't you see?

28:06.466 --> 28:09.733
- He wants you to hate me.
- Well, he succeeded.

28:09.769 --> 28:12.470
- Get the hell out of here!
- No!

28:12.505 --> 28:13.771
Fine.

28:13.806 --> 28:15.924
Carmine.

28:16.776 --> 28:19.610
Can you please help detective
Gordon find the exit?

28:19.645 --> 28:21.445
Certainly.

28:24.317 --> 28:25.516
And if you're ready, my dear.

28:27.787 --> 28:29.787
I am.

29:18.771 --> 29:20.671
<i>Do you, Leslie,</i>

29:20.706 --> 29:21.972
take Mario to be your husband?

29:22.008 --> 29:23.741
I do.

29:28.213 --> 29:29.213
<i>And do you,</i>

29:29.248 --> 29:31.515
Mario, take Leslie to be your wife?

29:31.551 --> 29:33.417
I do.

29:37.056 --> 29:38.155
I now pronounce you

29:38.191 --> 29:39.857
<i>husband and wife.</i>

29:39.892 --> 29:41.592
You may kiss the bride.

30:04.650 --> 30:06.584
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

30:06.619 --> 30:08.385
Mr. and Mrs. Calvi.

30:34.887 --> 30:36.092
Well, I think it's safe to admit

30:36.116 --> 30:39.023
that our foreign friends
are no-show, master Bruce.

30:39.058 --> 30:40.891
It was a right dodgy plan, anyway.

30:40.927 --> 30:42.293
Where are you going?

30:42.328 --> 30:43.594
That would be home.

30:43.629 --> 30:46.297
Alfred, this is our only
shot to take down the court.

30:46.332 --> 30:47.598
You don't know that, do you?

30:47.633 --> 30:49.200
I mean, it was a moot point, anyway.

30:49.235 --> 30:50.746
I mean, walking across the
entire length of a room

30:50.770 --> 30:51.735
on a bloody tightrope?

30:51.771 --> 30:53.537
I can do it. I... I did it.

30:53.573 --> 30:55.973
Yeah, three times out of 20. I counted.

30:56.008 --> 30:56.974
No, thank you very much.

30:57.009 --> 30:58.609
I can do it.

30:59.879 --> 31:02.012
Oh, that's bloody marvelous, isn't it?

31:02.048 --> 31:03.113
Hey?

31:06.118 --> 31:07.718
Right.

31:07.753 --> 31:09.987
You stay on comms

31:10.022 --> 31:11.422
at all times.

31:11.457 --> 31:14.625
If I order abort, you
abort. Is that clear?

31:14.660 --> 31:16.227
I need my head examined.

31:16.262 --> 31:17.528
Really do.

31:21.334 --> 31:22.666
What?

31:22.702 --> 31:24.802
Just wondering.

31:26.806 --> 31:28.572
Does this mean you <i> are</i> my girlfriend?

31:28.608 --> 31:31.108
Shut up.

31:39.485 --> 31:41.452
<i>So, I thought, if I were Mario,</i>

31:41.487 --> 31:42.753
how would I beat the test?

31:42.788 --> 31:44.366
Well, the test looks for
this one marker in the blood,

31:44.390 --> 31:46.757
but that marker can be
masked by an abundance

31:46.792 --> 31:47.792
of certain other drugs.

31:47.827 --> 31:49.293
The two most easily available,

31:49.328 --> 31:50.494
cloracinamine and...

31:50.529 --> 31:52.296
Lucius, just-just get to the point.

31:52.331 --> 31:55.199
Mario's blood came back off
the charts for cloracinamine.

31:56.235 --> 31:57.568
Alvarez!

31:57.603 --> 31:59.904
Get a unit on Lee Thompkins
and Dr. Mario Calvi,

31:59.939 --> 32:01.639
and don't let them out of your sight!

32:01.674 --> 32:02.940
This isn't proof that Mario

32:02.975 --> 32:04.041
killed those men.

32:04.076 --> 32:06.377
No, but it's enough
for a search warrant.

32:06.412 --> 32:08.145
Now I got to go find Jim Gordon.

32:08.180 --> 32:11.448
Don't mess with Falcone!

32:39.278 --> 32:40.945
Hey.

33:10.609 --> 33:12.020
All right, straight to the safe room.

33:12.044 --> 33:13.522
I'm gonna check the rest of the house.

33:13.546 --> 33:15.379
Go on. This way.

33:25.558 --> 33:27.591
Not exactly hiding it.

33:27.626 --> 33:28.892
There's no point.

33:28.928 --> 33:30.661
The floor is alarmed.

33:44.410 --> 33:47.478
Don't... let... go.

35:20.206 --> 35:21.238
Come on!

35:27.046 --> 35:28.078
Out the way you came!

35:33.419 --> 35:34.419
- Let's go!
- No!

35:40.593 --> 35:41.593
No!

36:15.561 --> 36:17.127
We have to leave.

36:17.163 --> 36:18.695
And who exactly are you?

36:18.731 --> 36:20.041
You're the one who's been

36:20.065 --> 36:21.331
following us.

36:27.673 --> 36:29.540
Hey.

36:31.243 --> 36:33.610
You know her?

36:34.647 --> 36:36.013
That's my mom.

36:38.450 --> 36:39.750
Now can we get out of here?

36:39.785 --> 36:41.285
You're bloody right.

36:50.428 --> 36:52.860
Found it! In his trash.

36:52.923 --> 36:53.888
Cloracinamine.

36:53.924 --> 36:56.524
Oh, yes.

36:56.560 --> 36:57.592
We got him.

36:57.627 --> 36:58.593
Tell Alvarez.

36:58.628 --> 37:00.061
That was Alvarez.

37:00.097 --> 37:02.063
Lee and Mario snuck
out of the reception.

37:02.099 --> 37:03.765
He lost them.

37:10.474 --> 37:12.741
I can't even hold a knife.

37:12.776 --> 37:14.609
I swear, when I see Nygma...

37:14.644 --> 37:16.911
We'll kill him together. Real slow.

37:16.947 --> 37:18.713
How sweet.

37:25.489 --> 37:26.489
Son of a bitch!

37:27.190 --> 37:28.623
Hear him out.

37:28.658 --> 37:30.058
Please.

37:41.404 --> 37:43.872
I don't want to kill him.

37:49.279 --> 37:51.679
I want to destroy him.

37:52.883 --> 37:54.749
I want to take...

37:54.785 --> 37:56.818
Away...

37:56.853 --> 37:58.787
Everything that he loves.

38:00.090 --> 38:03.024
I want to make him...

38:03.059 --> 38:04.526
Despised.

38:04.561 --> 38:06.027
What are you talking about?

38:06.062 --> 38:07.228
Penguin.

38:09.599 --> 38:13.334
- He killed the librarian.
- What?

38:14.304 --> 38:16.004
And you cut off my hand?!

38:16.039 --> 38:17.906
I assume you want something.

38:17.941 --> 38:19.707
With penguin gone,

38:19.743 --> 38:21.576
the underworld will need a new leader.

38:23.380 --> 38:26.581
I think it's time Gotham
had a woman's touch.

38:26.616 --> 38:28.416
The crime families
will never follow you.

38:28.451 --> 38:29.717
Well, that's where you come in.

38:29.753 --> 38:31.886
You know the families in and out.

38:31.922 --> 38:33.655
Not to mention, you're a whiz

38:33.690 --> 38:35.657
at strategy.

38:36.726 --> 38:39.027
Think about it, Ed.

38:39.062 --> 38:42.897
Your brains, their brawn,

38:42.933 --> 38:45.533
my...

38:45.569 --> 38:47.101
Me.

38:47.137 --> 38:49.170
We could make quite a team.

38:54.177 --> 38:55.910
We destroy penguin first.

38:55.946 --> 38:58.213
Of course.

38:58.248 --> 39:00.715
But there is one thing you need to do.

39:06.590 --> 39:07.922
Okay.

39:14.931 --> 39:16.397
I'm sorry about your hand.

39:16.433 --> 39:17.866
Apology not accepted!

39:17.901 --> 39:20.068
Well, we'll work on that.

39:20.103 --> 39:21.103
Drinks!

39:47.297 --> 39:49.063
Hey.

39:51.234 --> 39:54.035
Thank you.

39:54.070 --> 39:56.771
Thank you for letting us
leave that party early.

39:56.806 --> 39:57.939
Hmm, of course.

39:57.974 --> 39:59.274
I wanted to.

39:59.309 --> 40:00.742
I love this house.

40:00.777 --> 40:02.210
It's my father's refuge.

40:02.245 --> 40:04.512
Not many people know about it.

40:05.548 --> 40:08.950
I know Gordon came to the church.

40:08.985 --> 40:10.852
Talked to you.

40:10.887 --> 40:12.553
It was just like you said.

40:12.589 --> 40:14.022
He said you had the virus.

40:14.057 --> 40:15.390
He was obsessed.

40:17.827 --> 40:19.127
And what did you say?

40:19.162 --> 40:22.030
That after the wedding, we
would be leaving Gotham.

40:22.065 --> 40:23.698
That I would never see him again.

40:24.734 --> 40:26.301
Is that it?

40:26.336 --> 40:27.535
What are you asking me?

40:27.570 --> 40:30.705
I'm asking...

40:30.740 --> 40:34.542
If there's any part
of you, however small,

40:34.577 --> 40:37.245
that still has feelings for him.

40:37.280 --> 40:38.713
And I swear,

40:38.748 --> 40:41.416
I will never ask you again.

40:43.653 --> 40:45.787
A part of me will always care for him.

40:48.358 --> 40:50.024
But I married you.

40:50.060 --> 40:51.993
I love you.

40:59.035 --> 41:01.602
That's all I needed to know.

41:08.778 --> 41:10.244
Where are they?

41:10.280 --> 41:11.479
Don Falcone, he just...

41:11.514 --> 41:12.780
Where are they?!

41:14.851 --> 41:15.984
You don't give up, do you?

41:16.019 --> 41:18.152
Your son has Alice Tetch's virus.

41:18.188 --> 41:19.854
He's killed two people we know of.

41:19.889 --> 41:21.789
Every cop in this city is after him.

41:21.825 --> 41:22.991
Where is he?

41:30.433 --> 41:31.532
You knew?

41:31.568 --> 41:34.235
That Mario had the same virus as Barnes?

41:34.270 --> 41:35.436
No.

41:35.472 --> 41:37.672
I knew he was in danger,
but I didn't know why.

41:37.707 --> 41:40.842
I never suspected this.

41:40.877 --> 41:43.611
You're saying the attacks
on Mario... the car bomb...

41:43.646 --> 41:45.013
It's because of the virus?

41:45.048 --> 41:48.016
How is that possible?
Who knew he had it?

41:48.051 --> 41:49.250
I can't tell you that.

41:52.216 --> 41:54.251
I'll send my men to bring Mario in.

41:55.658 --> 41:57.959
You think I'd trust Lee's
life with these two goons?

41:57.994 --> 41:59.994
Tell me where they are.

42:00.030 --> 42:01.763
If I do that, you'll kill him.

42:01.798 --> 42:02.964
I know you, James.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.900
Mario is my son.

42:05.935 --> 42:09.570
There is nothing and no
one more valuable to me.

42:09.606 --> 42:12.740
And if he does have this
sickness, he needs help.

42:12.776 --> 42:14.220
And if he kills Lee, he'll cross a line

42:14.244 --> 42:15.576
he'll never come back from.

42:15.612 --> 42:19.881
Even if he's cured, knowing
that will destroy him.

42:19.916 --> 42:21.449
I'm your only hope.

42:23.353 --> 42:25.453
Still, I'll send my men.

42:25.488 --> 42:26.521
You mean these two?

42:31.027 --> 42:32.527
Anyone else you want to send?

42:33.696 --> 42:35.997
Swear that you'll bring him in alive.

42:36.032 --> 42:37.598
I swear.

42:37.634 --> 42:39.067
Now, where are they?

42:44.140 --> 42:46.274
<i>She loves him.</i>

42:46.309 --> 42:47.520
<i>Loves him!</i>

42:47.544 --> 42:49.410
<i>She loves him. Loves him.</i>

42:49.446 --> 42:52.113
<i>She loves him. She loves him.</i>

42:52.148 --> 42:53.581
<i>She loves him. Loves him.</i>

42:53.616 --> 42:55.516
<i>She loves him. She loves him.</i>

43:01.391 --> 43:03.424
<i>She loves him.</i>

43:03.460 --> 43:05.359
<i>She loves him. Loves him.</i>

43:05.395 --> 43:07.261
<i>She loves him. She loves him.</i>

43:07.297 --> 43:08.496
Lee!

43:09.132 --> 43:10.398
Jim?

43:11.305 --> 43:17.907
