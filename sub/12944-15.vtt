Ethan, i-it's Ethan Craft,
he's on the other line.

-Ethan? Ethan?
-Oh my gosh, I gotta go.

20:31.734 --> 20:33.033
I so wanna be you.

Can someone please explain
this guy's appeal to me?

20:37.333 --> 20:40.500
I'm back. So, what's up.

20:40.867 --> 20:42.600
Uh, hey, listen.
I was wondering

20:43.033 --> 20:44.633
what are you doing
for lunch on Saturday?

20:45.300 --> 20:48.233
Um, nothing, yet.

20:48.834 --> 20:53.567
So, then you'll have time
to pick up a pizza for me and Matt.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.066
I love that little guy.

20:55.133 --> 20:56.333
That'd be... That'd be great!

20:56.433 --> 20:58.433
But, I think that's
when Matt's nap time is.

20:58.633 --> 20:59.633
Later.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.300
But Matt's
a friend of Ethan's

21:18.367 --> 21:20.100
which makes Matt popular,

21:20.233 --> 21:21.500
which means, he...

21:21.567 --> 21:23.633
We'll be popular,
I mean, Matt could help us.
