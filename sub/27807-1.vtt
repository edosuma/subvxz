40:56.454 --> 41:00.190
And I want you to envision
that light in you.

41:00.192 --> 41:06.196
Inject this building with
that positive, wonderful moment.

41:06.198 --> 41:07.863
BERRY: Repeat after me.

41:07.865 --> 41:09.531
"You are not welcome."

41:09.533 --> 41:11.267
ALL: You are not welcome.

41:11.269 --> 41:13.402
"You are banished."

41:13.404 --> 41:16.673
You are banished.

41:16.675 --> 41:20.143
BRUNI:
The idea of positive energy
may not seem like much,

41:20.145 --> 41:24.046
but in the paranormal realm,
it's extraordinarily powerful.

41:24.048 --> 41:26.683
BRUNI: You keep telling it,
"This is our space."

41:26.685 --> 41:29.118
If something like that comes
back, like, immediately,

41:29.120 --> 41:32.087
you need to reclaim that space
because it is yours.

41:32.089 --> 41:33.356
It's not theirs.

41:33.358 --> 41:35.224
There's no doubt
this made a difference,

41:35.226 --> 41:36.960
but it's up to Jesse
and his family

41:36.962 --> 41:39.162
to stay vigilant
and keep control.

41:39.164 --> 41:41.364
Let us know if anything else
happens in here.

41:41.366 --> 41:43.032
-Sure.
-But I feel like what we did --

41:43.034 --> 41:45.034
I could feel it working
as we did it.

41:45.036 --> 41:46.436
Yeah, it's great.
Thanks for coming in.

41:46.438 --> 41:47.837
Yeah.

41:47.839 --> 41:50.539
Our number-one priority
is always the living,

41:50.541 --> 41:53.576
but in this case,
we got to do even more.

41:53.578 --> 41:56.045
Our battle with evil is going
to make it safe

41:56.047 --> 41:57.380
for the innocent spirits

41:57.382 --> 41:59.749
who remain here,
like the orphans.
