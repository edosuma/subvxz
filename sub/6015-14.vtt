00:03.934 --> 00:05.765
Women put on perfume
in an interesting way.

00:05.934 --> 00:07.128
Ever notice that, guys?

00:07.294 --> 00:11.446
They have their little key,
Stratego little areas.

00:15.774 --> 00:19.130
Places they think we're going.

00:21.534 --> 00:22.967
And they always hit this one.

00:23.134 --> 00:24.487
Women are convinced...

00:24.654 --> 00:29.808
...that this is the most action-packed
area that could ever happen...

00:29.974 --> 00:31.930
...in the dating world.

00:32.134 --> 00:34.045
What is that, ladies?
What is happening here?

00:34.214 --> 00:36.853
Is that in case you slap the guy
or something?

00:37.014 --> 00:38.970
He still finds you intriguing?

00:39.294 --> 00:42.013
"Oh, Chanel!"

00:46.974 --> 00:49.932
She's a pianist, a classical pianist!
She plays the piano!

00:50.094 --> 00:51.607
She's a brilliant woman!

00:51.774 --> 00:54.925
I sat in her living room,
she played the Waldstein Sonata.

00:55.094 --> 00:56.891
The Waldstein!

01:00.534 --> 01:03.412
We did a crossword puzzle
together in bed.

01:03.574 --> 01:05.610
It was the most fun I ever
had in my entire life!

01:05.774 --> 01:08.413
Do you hear me? In my life!

01:09.054 --> 01:10.612
You know?

01:10.774 --> 01:13.129
Were you talking?
I couldn't hear anything.

01:15.414 --> 01:16.688
I was telling you about Noel.

01:16.854 --> 01:19.414
Oh, Noel, yeah.
The one that plays the bongos.

01:20.254 --> 01:22.006
So sidesplittingly funny.

01:22.974 --> 01:25.283
All right, I'm sorry. What about her?

01:25.454 --> 01:27.251
You think I'm gonna repeat
the whole thing?

01:27.414 --> 01:29.689
You told me you like her.
Everything's going good.

01:29.854 --> 01:31.412
No, everything's not going good.

01:31.574 --> 01:34.168
I'm very uncomfortable.
I have no power.

01:34.334 --> 01:35.767
Why should she have
the upper hand?

01:35.934 --> 01:38.846
For once, I'd like the upper hand.
I have no hand, no hand at all.

01:39.014 --> 01:40.732
She has the hand. I have no hand.

01:41.054 --> 01:43.284
- Hand me that, would you?
- Yeah.

01:43.454 --> 01:44.682
How do I get the hand?

01:44.854 --> 01:47.368
We all want the hand.
Hand is tough to get.

01:47.534 --> 01:49.490
You gotta get the hand
right from the opening.

01:49.654 --> 01:52.691
She's playing a recital at
the McBierny School.

01:52.854 --> 01:55.209
I got two extra tickets.
You and Elaine could go.

01:55.374 --> 01:57.763
Yeah, that sounds like something.

02:00.334 --> 02:02.802
Then afterwards, maybe we could all
go out together.

02:02.974 --> 02:04.612
You know, she'll see me
with my friends.

02:04.774 --> 02:07.083
She'll observe me
as I really am, as myself.

02:07.254 --> 02:09.687
Maybe I can get some hand that way.

02:11.094 --> 02:12.527
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

02:12.694 --> 02:14.332
Hey, smell my arm.

02:16.054 --> 02:17.203
- What?
- Smell it. Smell it.

02:17.374 --> 02:19.604
With all due respect,
I don't think so.

02:19.774 --> 02:22.732
- Jerry, smell.
- That smells good. What is that?

02:22.894 --> 02:24.964
- The beach.
- The beach?

02:25.134 --> 02:26.647
Did you go swimming?
It's 29 degrees.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.374
No, I just joined the Polar Bear Club.

02:29.534 --> 02:32.002
- You joined the Polar Bears?
- What the hell's a Polar Bear?

02:32.174 --> 02:34.813
These people go swimming
in the winter. They're terrific.

02:34.974 --> 02:37.488
I just took my first swim today.

02:38.054 --> 02:39.692
- It's invigorating.
- Yeah...

02:39.854 --> 02:42.004
...so is shock therapy.

02:42.814 --> 02:45.169
- What is that, a PEZ dispenser?
- Yeah. You want one?

02:46.734 --> 02:48.884
I just bought it at the flea market.
You want one?

02:49.054 --> 02:51.522
Hey, what goes on there, exactly?

02:51.694 --> 02:52.922
You don't know?

02:53.094 --> 02:55.483
No, I know. I know.

02:56.014 --> 02:58.608
You think they have fleas there,
don't you?

02:59.254 --> 03:01.370
- No.
- Yes, you do, Biff.

03:04.374 --> 03:06.763
You've never been,
and you think they have fleas there.

03:06.934 --> 03:09.368
All right, I think they have
fleas there. So what?

03:09.534 --> 03:11.252
- Here, you want this?
- You don't want it?

03:11.414 --> 03:14.645
- No, I bought five of them.
- Wow, great. Thanks.

03:17.614 --> 03:21.607
I don't know how anyone does this.
This must be so nerve-racking.

03:21.774 --> 03:23.287
How do they warm up their fingers?

03:23.454 --> 03:25.604
They have a piano backstage
they warm up on.

03:25.774 --> 03:27.253
No. We would have heard it.

03:27.414 --> 03:29.848
You think they just crack
their knuckles and come out?

03:30.014 --> 03:32.403
- I told her we'd go out afterwards.
- Sure.

03:32.574 --> 03:36.089
Don't applaud when she stops playing
the first time. It's not over yet.

03:36.254 --> 03:39.087
I really resent that.
That's directed at me, isn't it?

03:42.974 --> 03:45.204
Is this okay? Can I do this?

03:47.000 --> 03:53.074

04:58.934 --> 05:00.253
Oh, God.

05:00.414 --> 05:02.166
Something I said?

05:04.014 --> 05:05.606
It's John Mollica.

05:06.174 --> 05:09.769
Oh. Oh, John. Oh, hi, John.

05:09.934 --> 05:12.243
- Hi.
- What are you doing out here?

05:12.414 --> 05:14.484
I was just at this recital...

05:14.654 --> 05:18.010
...and Jerry put this PEZ dispenser
on my leg...

05:18.174 --> 05:20.847
...and I just started laughing.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.053
- Jerry's in there?
- Yeah.

05:23.214 --> 05:26.445
- I heard you guys broke up.
- We did. We're just hanging out.

05:26.614 --> 05:28.491
Really? Boy...

05:28.654 --> 05:32.363
...you really look great.

05:32.534 --> 05:34.923
Oh, thank you.

05:43.774 --> 05:46.607
Hey, are you still friends
with Richie Appel?

05:46.774 --> 05:49.527
Oh, Richie? He's been doing comedy
in L.A. for a couple of years.

05:49.694 --> 05:51.446
He just got back a month ago.

05:51.614 --> 05:54.333
He's kind of messed up on drugs.

05:55.734 --> 05:56.962
I don't know what to do.

05:57.134 --> 05:58.931
Have you thought
about an intervention?

05:59.094 --> 06:02.086
- What's that?
- You get all his friends in a room...

06:02.254 --> 06:04.563
...and they confront him
to try to get him into rehab.

06:04.734 --> 06:06.611
It's a very popular thing now.

06:06.774 --> 06:09.208
Well, he'd never listen to anyone.

06:10.934 --> 06:13.243
Except, of course, Jerry.

06:13.414 --> 06:15.564
He'd listen to Jerry.

06:15.734 --> 06:19.283
Jerry would have to be involved.

06:19.454 --> 06:23.242
He really respects Jerry.

06:29.814 --> 06:32.487
I'm sorry, George. I'm sorry.

06:32.854 --> 06:35.288
What did you put the PEZ dispenser
on her leg for?

06:35.454 --> 06:38.924
- I don't know. It was an impulse.
- What kind of a sick impulse is that?

06:40.454 --> 06:42.285
How could I know she'd start to laugh?

06:42.454 --> 06:45.127
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I am.

06:46.014 --> 06:48.244
- Could we go in already?
- What are we gonna tell her?

06:48.414 --> 06:51.486
- I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
- No, don't say a word.

06:51.654 --> 06:55.090
If she thinks my friends are jerks,
then I'm a jerk.

06:55.694 --> 06:57.525
Remind me to talk to you
about something.

06:57.694 --> 07:00.049
- What about?
- Hey, we're discussing something.

07:00.214 --> 07:02.170
I know, but I'm distracted now.

07:02.334 --> 07:03.892
What are you, a baby?

07:04.254 --> 07:05.573
All right, tell him.

07:05.734 --> 07:08.373
When I was outside,
I ran into John Mollica.

07:08.534 --> 07:10.013
- Really? John Mollica?
- Yeah.

07:10.174 --> 07:12.404
The guy that used to bartend
at the comedy club.

07:12.574 --> 07:14.007
- How's he doing?
- He's good.

07:14.174 --> 07:15.607
Could we cut to the chase?

07:16.134 --> 07:17.647
"Cut to the chase"?

07:18.974 --> 07:21.329
- Yeah.
- What are you, Joe Hollywood?

07:22.694 --> 07:23.922
A lot of people say it.

07:24.294 --> 07:25.488
I would lose that.

07:25.654 --> 07:27.451
What's that?

07:27.614 --> 07:29.764
"Lose that"? That's not
a Hollywood expression.

07:30.254 --> 07:32.085
Yes, it is.

07:32.894 --> 07:34.964
Anyway...

07:35.134 --> 07:38.046
So John told me that Richie
is in town from Los Angeles...

07:38.214 --> 07:40.011
...and he's really
messed up on drugs.

07:40.174 --> 07:42.165
So I told him
he should do an intervention.

07:42.334 --> 07:45.292
- Really? An intervention?
- We got a situation over here!

07:45.614 --> 07:48.492
- But he wants you to be a part of it.
- Why me?

07:48.654 --> 07:51.930
He says Richie really respects you,
and he would listen to you.

07:52.094 --> 07:54.972
These things are really hard to load.

07:58.494 --> 08:01.725
All right, okay. All right, I'm going in.

08:01.894 --> 08:05.011
- We got to talk about this.
- All right.

08:08.694 --> 08:11.572
Hi. Hi. Hi.

08:11.734 --> 08:14.692
- You were wonderful. Wonderful.
- No, no.

08:14.854 --> 08:17.129
These are my friends,
Elaine and Jerry. Noel.

08:17.294 --> 08:18.773
You play a hell of a piano.

08:20.054 --> 08:22.932
Yeah, I was really moved.
Really moved.

08:23.094 --> 08:25.403
Didn't you hear that person laughing?

08:25.574 --> 08:28.372
I couldn't play. I was humiliated!

08:28.534 --> 08:30.331
I'm sure it wasn't at you.

08:30.494 --> 08:32.212
Well, then what was she laughing at?

08:32.374 --> 08:35.764
- PEZ?
- No, thank you.

08:36.333 --> 08:38.006
Did you see her?

08:38.174 --> 08:39.892
Me? No, I...

08:40.054 --> 08:41.692
Anyone who would laugh
at a recital...

08:41.854 --> 08:43.970
...is probably some sort
of lunatic, anyway.

08:44.134 --> 08:49.254
I mean, only a sick, twisted mind
could be that rude and ignorant.

08:49.414 --> 08:52.451
Well, you know, maybe some
mental defective...

08:52.614 --> 08:55.572
...put something stupid on her leg.

08:55.934 --> 09:00.883
Even if this so-called mental defective
did put something on her leg...

09:01.054 --> 09:02.646
...she's still the one who laughed.

09:03.454 --> 09:07.925
I'll never forget that laugh
for the rest of my life.

09:08.894 --> 09:12.773
I'm sure she would apologize
if she could.

09:13.374 --> 09:15.410
Probably someone
is holding her back...

09:15.574 --> 09:18.168
...maybe against
every fibre of her being.

09:18.334 --> 09:21.849
If she wants to continue to have a fibre
of her being, she'll be very careful.

09:22.014 --> 09:23.925
- Don't hit me.
- Stop it.

09:25.454 --> 09:27.012
All right. So you ready?

09:27.174 --> 09:29.813
We'll go out,
and we'll have a bite to eat.

09:30.294 --> 09:33.172
I don't feel like it tonight.

09:33.494 --> 09:35.212
- We'll be outside.
- Yeah.

09:35.374 --> 09:36.568
It was nice meeting you.

09:37.534 --> 09:41.004
By the way, how do you warm up
your fingers before you play?

09:41.174 --> 09:43.369
I just crack my knuckles.

09:43.934 --> 09:45.970
Come on, we'll have a good time.

09:46.134 --> 09:48.329
- Well, I'm really not in the mood.
- Come on...

09:48.494 --> 09:52.089
I said, I don't feel like it.

09:55.734 --> 09:58.487
All right...

09:58.654 --> 10:00.610
I'll... I'll call you.

10:00.774 --> 10:04.403
I'll call you,
and we'll talk on the phone.

10:04.574 --> 10:07.930
Have a telephone communiqué.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.924
So, fine. Everything's fine.
Everything good?

10:11.094 --> 10:14.325
Good. I feel good. Fine.
That's fine. That's good.

10:14.494 --> 10:16.644
Okay. Okey-doke.

10:21.814 --> 10:24.647
You know, I think Kramer might
have been indirectly responsible...

10:24.814 --> 10:26.486
...for getting Richie
involved in drugs.

10:27.094 --> 10:28.447
What? How?

10:28.614 --> 10:30.969
A few years ago, the comedy club
had a softball team.

10:31.134 --> 10:32.772
Kramer was our first baseman.

10:32.934 --> 10:35.448
You couldn't get anything by him.
He was unbelievable.

10:35.614 --> 10:40.369
Anyway, this one game, we came back
to win from, like, eight runs behind.

10:40.534 --> 10:42.126
So Kramer says to Richie:

10:42.294 --> 10:45.525
"Why don't you dump the bucket
of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head?"

10:45.774 --> 10:47.605
- The club owner.
- Yeah.

10:47.774 --> 10:50.447
So Richie goes ahead and does it.

10:51.134 --> 10:52.806
- So? What happened?
- What happened?

10:52.974 --> 10:55.204
The guy was, like, 67 years old.
It was freezing out.

10:55.374 --> 10:57.683
He caught a cold, developed
pneumonia, a month later...

10:57.854 --> 11:01.369
...he was dead.
- Shut up.

11:02.214 --> 11:03.932
All the comedians were happy...

11:04.094 --> 11:06.403
...because he's one of these
club owners nobody liked.

11:06.574 --> 11:08.326
But Richie was never the same.

11:08.494 --> 11:11.247
- What about Kramer?
- He's the same.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.647
Are you sure you want me, John?

11:14.814 --> 11:17.612
I mean, I haven't spoken
to Richie in two years.

11:17.774 --> 11:20.811
I don't have a good apartment
for an intervention.

11:20.974 --> 11:24.489
The furniture,
it's very nonconfrontational.

11:24.654 --> 11:27.771
All right, all right. Goodbye.

11:27.934 --> 11:29.367
Remember Richie Appel?

11:29.694 --> 11:33.846
Oh, sure. The guy I told to pour the
Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?

11:36.574 --> 11:39.486
Right. John Mollica is organizing
some kind of intervention for him.

11:39.654 --> 11:40.973
We're having it here.

11:41.734 --> 11:43.531
Can I get in on that?

11:44.014 --> 11:46.574
What do you think,
it's like a poker game?

11:47.054 --> 11:48.567
- Is Elaine going?
- Yeah.

11:48.734 --> 11:50.486
Well, I knew him as well as she did.

11:50.654 --> 11:52.007
Yeah, but John invited her.

11:52.174 --> 11:54.324
So wait, you don't want me
to intervene?

11:54.494 --> 11:57.133
No, intervene, go ahead.
Intervene all you want.

11:57.294 --> 12:00.491
I'm just afraid you might be interfering
while we're intervening.

12:04.174 --> 12:05.493
- Yeah?
- It's George.

12:05.654 --> 12:06.803
Come on up.

12:06.974 --> 12:09.966
Stop smelling your arm!

12:10.454 --> 12:12.251
You know, I got a great idea
for a cologne.

12:12.414 --> 12:13.847
It's called "The Beach."

12:14.014 --> 12:17.131
You spray it on, and it's just like
you came home from the beach.

12:17.294 --> 12:19.683
A cologne that smells
like the beach.

12:19.854 --> 12:24.370
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but that's not a bad idea.

12:25.454 --> 12:26.967
Tell me about it.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.767
Why don't you call Steve D'Giff?

12:28.934 --> 12:31.289
He works in the marketing department
at Calvin Klein.

12:31.454 --> 12:35.003
In fact, he's a good friend
of John Mollica and Richie, also.

12:35.174 --> 12:36.687
Okay.

12:37.734 --> 12:39.929
Well, it's over. It's definitely over.

12:40.414 --> 12:42.484
- She broke up with you?
- No, but she's going to.

12:42.654 --> 12:46.010
I can sense it. We had this
terrible phone conversation.

12:46.174 --> 12:49.325
I was so nervous before I called,
I made a list of things to talk about.

12:49.494 --> 12:51.246
What was on the list?

12:51.414 --> 12:53.166
Let's see.

12:53.854 --> 12:56.243
"I'm very good
at going in reverse in my car.

12:59.254 --> 13:01.449
Why isn't Postum
a more popular drink?"

13:04.734 --> 13:07.771
Yeah, Postum is underrated.

13:07.934 --> 13:09.731
Anyway, there was all this tension.

13:09.894 --> 13:11.930
I asked her if she wanted
to go out to dinner...

13:12.094 --> 13:14.210
...and she said,
"No, maybe we could have lunch."

13:14.374 --> 13:16.569
- You know what that means.
- What's wrong with lunch?

13:16.734 --> 13:19.248
Lunch is fine at the beginning,
then you move on to dinner.

13:19.414 --> 13:22.326
You don't go back to lunch.
It's like being demoted.

13:22.654 --> 13:25.168
I'll never do a crossword puzzle
with her again, I know it.

13:25.534 --> 13:28.367
I like the jumble.
You ever do the jumble?

13:28.734 --> 13:30.213
I have no power, you understand?

13:30.374 --> 13:32.569
I need hand! I have no hand!

13:32.734 --> 13:34.804
- Why don't you break up with her.
- What?

13:34.974 --> 13:37.283
Break up with her.
You reverse everything that way.

13:37.854 --> 13:40.209
A preemptive breakup.

13:41.934 --> 13:44.402
A preemptive breakup.

13:44.734 --> 13:47.567
- This is an incredible idea.
- Yeah.

13:49.654 --> 13:51.690
I got nothing to lose.

13:51.854 --> 13:53.890
We either break up,
which she would do anyway...

13:54.054 --> 13:55.772
...but I go out with some dignity...

13:55.934 --> 13:58.164
...or I completely turn the tables!

13:58.574 --> 14:01.168
This is absolutely brilliant!

14:01.334 --> 14:04.292
So I'm afraid I...

14:04.454 --> 14:06.604
...am gonna have to
break up with you.

14:09.094 --> 14:11.449
- You're breaking up with me?
- Yes.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.731
I...

14:14.734 --> 14:16.087
...am breaking up with you.

14:17.654 --> 14:19.133
- Wow.
- Shocked?

14:19.294 --> 14:22.331
- I really am.
- Never expected this, did you?

14:22.494 --> 14:26.328
- I thought everything was fine.
- Well, live and learn.

14:28.734 --> 14:31.168
Well, I don't understand.
You didn't enjoy being with me?

14:31.334 --> 14:33.370
Didn't we have fun
doing the crossword puzzle?

14:33.894 --> 14:35.122
Kind of.

14:35.894 --> 14:38.886
- I'm very confused.
- Well, I didn't mean to hurt you, kid.

14:40.414 --> 14:42.484
- I thought...
- Now, stop it, please.

14:42.654 --> 14:46.010
What do you want?
I know I can make you happy.

14:49.214 --> 14:51.774
When you're playing the piano...

14:52.414 --> 14:54.086
...do you think about me?

14:54.254 --> 14:56.563
- I don't know.
- This is what I'm talking about.

14:56.734 --> 14:59.453
Okay, I'll think about you.

14:59.614 --> 15:01.047
- All the time?
- All the time?

15:01.214 --> 15:04.172
- You know...
- Okay, all the time.

15:04.334 --> 15:07.531
- I can't hear you.
- All the time!

15:07.854 --> 15:10.448
See? It's not so hard.

15:11.454 --> 15:14.890
Go ahead. Smell. Smell it.

15:16.054 --> 15:17.692
- Yeah? So?
- Now, you recognize it?

15:18.054 --> 15:19.282
I don't know.

15:19.694 --> 15:21.525
The beach.

15:22.334 --> 15:25.531
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, I'm talking about the beach.

15:26.254 --> 15:28.165
What about it?

15:28.334 --> 15:30.131
You know the way you smell...

15:30.294 --> 15:34.287
...when you first come home
from the beach?

15:34.454 --> 15:38.129
Well, I want to make
a cologne that captures...

15:38.294 --> 15:41.013
...the essence of that smell.

15:41.454 --> 15:43.046
Oh, yeah.

15:43.214 --> 15:45.364
That is the dumbest idea
I've ever heard.

15:45.534 --> 15:48.844
Whoa, wait a minute. You...

15:49.014 --> 15:50.811
Did you hear what I just said?

15:51.374 --> 15:54.172
You think people
are gonna pay $80 a bottle...

15:54.334 --> 15:56.529
...to smell like dead fish
and seaweed?

15:57.654 --> 16:00.566
That's why people take showers
when they come home from the beach.

16:00.734 --> 16:04.568
It's an objectionable, offensive odour.

16:05.374 --> 16:08.332
So you don't think
that it's a good idea?

16:12.294 --> 16:15.206
The membranes get dry,
and it just starts bleeding.

16:16.414 --> 16:20.726
Since I was a kid, so I have to
stick a tissue up there.

16:22.814 --> 16:24.566
You have to work like that?

16:24.734 --> 16:27.089
Yeah. Nobody minds.

16:27.574 --> 16:30.247
Nobody's ever said anything to me.

16:30.654 --> 16:32.804
- There any ice cubes?
- Whatever's in the freezer.

16:32.974 --> 16:34.726
I looked. I don't see any ice cubes.

16:34.894 --> 16:36.691
Well, then I guess
there's no ice cubes.

16:36.854 --> 16:39.971
I can't drink this. It's warm.

16:43.894 --> 16:45.612
John, shouldn't we rehearse this...

16:45.774 --> 16:47.685
...before Richie comes?
What's the plan?

16:47.854 --> 16:49.367
Do I have to talk?
I don't want to.

16:49.534 --> 16:51.445
If he's not gonna talk,
then I don't want to.

16:51.614 --> 16:54.174
- No, we all have to talk!
- What's the order?

16:54.334 --> 16:56.165
Alphabetical order.
You're first, Roberta.

16:56.334 --> 16:58.325
- Why am I first?
- Albano's your last name.

16:58.494 --> 17:00.724
- Not anymore. I'm divorced.
- I'll go first.

17:00.894 --> 17:02.486
- Oh, hey!
- Hey.

17:02.654 --> 17:04.531
- Is this the interference?
- Intervention.

17:04.694 --> 17:07.685
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, is it all right if I stay?

17:07.854 --> 17:10.492
He can't stay.
This is for close friends only.

17:10.654 --> 17:11.848
Hey, I'm a friend.

17:12.013 --> 17:14.733
Who told him to pour the Gatorade
over Marty Benson's head?

17:14.894 --> 17:16.724
- Oh, let him stay.
- Yeah.

17:17.854 --> 17:20.414
Hey, I got somebody to make up
that cologne for me, bigmouth.

17:20.574 --> 17:22.484
Somebody's going to make that crap?

17:22.654 --> 17:25.373
- Kramer!
- Hey, you guys! All right!

17:25.534 --> 17:27.923
Come on in. These are some
of my Polar Bear buddies.

17:28.094 --> 17:30.562
- They can't stay.
- You're having a party here?

17:30.734 --> 17:32.247
No, we're having an intervention.

17:32.414 --> 17:35.451
An intervention? Who's intervening?

17:35.614 --> 17:38.174
He's a friend of ours on drugs,
and we're gonna confront him.

17:38.334 --> 17:40.086
Sure. We used to do that...

17:40.254 --> 17:43.451
...when one of our Polar Bears stopped
coming. We'd go to his house:

17:43.614 --> 17:45.844
"What, you don't want to be
a Polar Bear anymore?

17:46.014 --> 17:49.370
- It's too cold for you?"
- It's him!

17:49.534 --> 17:51.923
- What do we do?
- Hide!

17:52.174 --> 17:55.450
It's not a surprise party!

17:55.614 --> 17:56.808
- Yeah?
- It's George.

17:56.974 --> 17:58.805
Come on up.

17:58.974 --> 18:01.044
It's not him.

18:01.214 --> 18:04.331
You don't wanna go out with me
because I'm a bartender, right?

18:04.494 --> 18:09.363
Look, you know, I don't really think
that this is appropriate right now.

18:09.534 --> 18:12.002
Is it because I have a tissue
in my nose?

18:12.614 --> 18:15.412
- You're getting warm.
- Hey, we just...

18:15.574 --> 18:17.849
We just came from Chadway's.
What's going on?

18:18.014 --> 18:19.766
The intervention.
We're waiting for Richie.

18:19.934 --> 18:23.927
Right, the intervention.
Should we leave?

18:24.094 --> 18:26.403
- Well...
- Elaine, hi.

18:26.574 --> 18:28.087
Hi, Noel.

18:28.254 --> 18:30.006
Well, you're looking well.

18:30.174 --> 18:31.892
Jerry, let me tell you something.

18:32.054 --> 18:35.444
A man without hand is not a man.

18:35.614 --> 18:38.572
I've got so much hand,
I'm coming out of my gloves.

18:38.734 --> 18:39.928
I gotta thank Kramer.

18:40.094 --> 18:41.925
Even if I were dragged
through manure...

18:42.094 --> 18:43.766
...I still wouldn't put that stuff on.

18:43.934 --> 18:47.131
This man is a genius! A genius!

18:47.294 --> 18:49.410
- You think so?
- I don't think so, I know so.

18:49.574 --> 18:50.973
Come here. I gotta talk to you.

18:51.134 --> 18:53.773
The male kangaroo
doesn't have a pouch.

18:53.934 --> 18:55.970
Only the female has it...

18:56.134 --> 18:59.410
...so the male has pouch envy!

19:00.734 --> 19:05.046
"Why should she have
this huge pouch and I have nothing?

19:05.214 --> 19:07.887
I have things to carry too.

19:09.334 --> 19:11.894
At least give me a pocket."

19:25.214 --> 19:28.047
That laugh. That's the laugh.

19:28.214 --> 19:30.967
- That's it! You're the one!
- No, no.

19:31.134 --> 19:34.968
No, it was an accident.
It wasn't my fault! It was Jerry!

19:35.134 --> 19:37.728
Jerry put a PEZ dispenser
on my leg!

19:37.894 --> 19:41.682
You put a PEZ dispenser
on her leg during my recital?

19:41.854 --> 19:44.084
- I didn't know she would laugh.
- And, you...

19:44.254 --> 19:46.484
You lied to me, George.
You lied to me!

19:46.654 --> 19:50.249
No, l... I didn't. What did I do?

19:51.694 --> 19:53.047
Where are you going?

19:54.174 --> 19:58.486
I am breaking up with you.

19:59.094 --> 20:01.847
You can't break up with me.
I've got hand!

20:02.334 --> 20:04.973
And you're gonna need it.

20:08.014 --> 20:10.244
Noel!

20:11.334 --> 20:14.485
- Hey, Richie!
- Hey, Richie.

20:14.894 --> 20:16.247
So, what's going on?

20:17.134 --> 20:20.888
So we start the intervention,
and it's pretty ugly from the get-go.

20:21.054 --> 20:24.490
He's not listening, he's hostile,
he's talking back.

20:24.654 --> 20:26.963
I can't do these puzzles.

20:27.134 --> 20:28.886
So he starts to get up.

20:29.054 --> 20:32.888
Suddenly, he spots the PEZ dispenser
on the coffee table.

20:33.054 --> 20:35.124
The PEZ dispenser.

20:35.294 --> 20:37.762
He picks it up, he's staring at it.

20:37.934 --> 20:39.845
It's like he's hypnotized by it.

20:40.014 --> 20:42.653
Then he's telling us this story
about how when he was a kid...

20:42.814 --> 20:44.486
...he was in the car
with his father...

20:44.654 --> 20:46.804
...and his father was trying
to load one of them.

20:46.974 --> 20:50.569
- Well, they're hard to load.
- Tell me something I don't know.

20:51.774 --> 20:55.653
So as the father's trying to load it,
he loses control of the car...

20:55.814 --> 20:57.964
...crashes into a high school cafeteria.

20:58.134 --> 20:59.613
- Get out.
- Nobody's hurt...

20:59.774 --> 21:02.242
...but PEZ was all over the car.

21:02.414 --> 21:04.166
And the dispenser was destroyed...

21:04.334 --> 21:06.086
...virtually beyond recognition.

21:08.054 --> 21:09.965
- Poor kid.
- So as he's telling the story...

21:10.134 --> 21:11.123
...he starts crying.

21:11.414 --> 21:12.927
- What did you do?
- What do you think?

21:13.094 --> 21:15.813
- I gave him my PEZ dispenser.
- Wow.

21:15.974 --> 21:18.807
Two hours later,
he checks into Smither's clinic.

21:18.974 --> 21:21.852
Talked to the doctor yesterday.
He's doing great on the rehab...

21:22.014 --> 21:24.289
...he's hooked on PEZ.

21:26.894 --> 21:28.646
He's eating them
like there's no tomorrow.

21:29.214 --> 21:31.409
What's a three-letter word for candy?

21:33.494 --> 21:35.769
I can't do those things.

21:47.294 --> 21:50.764
Jawbreakers, to me, was like
the ultimate challenge candy.

21:50.934 --> 21:54.165
It was like candy manufacturers were
sitting in their laboratories, going:

21:54.334 --> 21:56.370
"I wonder if they'll eat this.

21:56.534 --> 21:58.968
This seems pretty tough to eat.

21:59.134 --> 22:01.523
Let's market it
as some sort of experiment."

22:01.694 --> 22:04.083
But the concept of Jawbreakers...
What was the concept?

22:04.254 --> 22:06.768
Multicoloured cement balls
for a quarter?

22:06.934 --> 22:08.572
Was that the idea behind it?

22:08.734 --> 22:11.089
"Let's see if we can hurt them.

22:11.254 --> 22:14.087
Let's see if they'll pay to be hurt."

22:14.254 --> 22:15.926
This is the idea behind Jawbreakers.

22:16.094 --> 22:17.607
I did it, I ate them, I loved them.

22:19.934 --> 22:22.368
"Oh, this is very painful.
I'm really hurting.

22:22.534 --> 22:25.367
And this is hurting me a lot.
I love them."
