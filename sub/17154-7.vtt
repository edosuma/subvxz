It's so good to be home.

00:17.083 --> 00:18.166
Hey, guys, could you keep it down?

00:18.250 --> 00:19.667
I've gotta finish these
songs for the next record.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.417
[scoffs] You're already working
on new songs?

00:21.500 --> 00:22.917
We've been home for, like,
what, ten minutes?

00:23.000 --> 00:26.041
Yeah, and I'm not even done
with the second song yet.

00:26.125 --> 00:28.000
I hope I don't have writer's block.

00:29.458 --> 00:31.375
Nothing like a power nap.

00:32.083 --> 00:34.041
Here's Frankie Bear,
but where's Frankie?

00:37.709 --> 00:39.000
How long have you been in there?

00:39.709 --> 00:42.417
Since your last drum solo.

00:43.041 --> 00:45.000
Hey, Frankster,
haven't seen you since--

00:45.083 --> 00:46.834
We were playing hide and seek?

00:46.917 --> 00:49.291
Oh, right.
Sorry about that.

00:49.375 --> 00:51.458
I guess you win.
[chuckles]

00:52.083 --> 00:54.125
I'll be in my man-cave.

00:55.083 --> 00:58.208
All right, look,
Mom told me to tell you guys

00:58.291 --> 01:00.375
to clean out the tour bus
and do your dirty laundry.

01:00.458 --> 01:02.542
And I should warn you, she had that,

01:02.625 --> 01:05.500
"Clean out the tour bus and do
your dirty laundry" look on her face.

01:05.583 --> 01:08.041
But, Dad, there's ten weeks
of dirty laundry on that bus.

01:08.125 --> 01:09.583
We go back to school on Monday.

01:09.667 --> 01:11.542
It's our last weekend of freedom.
We want to go wild.

01:11.625 --> 01:13.834
-You know, do something crazy.
-Like sleep.

01:13.917 --> 01:16.875
I'll fix it with Mom, all right?
But look, first thing in the morning

01:16.959 --> 01:18.959
you've got to do the laundry, all right,

01:19.041 --> 01:22.000
before those clothes go out on tour
by themselves. [chuckles]

01:22.083 --> 01:24.125
If our clothes go on tour by themselves,

01:24.208 --> 01:26.959
my leather pants
get their own dressing room.

01:27.041 --> 01:28.625
Just do it.

01:29.125 --> 01:32.250
So, gentlemen,
I've just loaded all your clothes back

01:32.333 --> 01:35.083
into what I like to call
"The Stellavator."

01:35.166 --> 01:38.834
Patent pending.
Check it out.

01:38.917 --> 01:40.041
You too, Nick.

01:41.250 --> 01:44.041
OK, I've cross-referenced everything

01:44.125 --> 01:46.625
according to brother, season,
occasion, and fashion curve,

01:46.709 --> 01:49.333
which, as usual thanks to me,
we're ahead of.

01:49.417 --> 01:51.041

-It's Saturday night...

Wow, that is sick.
OK, do one for me.

02:02.458 --> 02:03.709
OK.

02:03.792 --> 02:07.667
Weekend, photo shoot, spring.

02:09.583 --> 02:11.458
Wow, that is too cool.

02:11.542 --> 02:13.750
OK, but do you see those pants?
I need new pants.

02:14.750 --> 02:15.959
[alarm sounds]

02:16.041 --> 02:18.583
No clashing allowed.

02:18.667 --> 02:22.959
Any changes must be approved
through my department, which is me.

02:23.041 --> 02:24.667
Cool. Are these pants OK
to get something to eat?

02:24.750 --> 02:26.792
-'Cause I'm starving.
-Come with?

02:26.875 --> 02:28.375
Oh, I'd love to,

02:28.458 --> 02:31.375
but I have to replace the knees
in all of Kevin's pants.

02:31.458 --> 02:34.875
Why do you insist on power-sliding
across stage every night?

02:34.959 --> 02:37.041
Because I'm awesome.

02:37.166 --> 02:38.583
He is awesome.

02:39.875 --> 02:43.834
Anyway, it's probably gonna take me
all night by myself.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.375
-Have fun.
-Bye, see ya.

we were all worried about you.

-I guess.

04:27.458 --> 04:30.500
So, in a couple days we're flying to
England to meet the prime minister,

04:30.583 --> 04:33.333
so he can personally thank you guys
for those charity concerts you did.

04:33.417 --> 04:35.917
I know he's like the president
of England and all,

04:36.000 --> 04:37.500
but what did they say
to call him again?

04:37.583 --> 04:39.333
It was something like "Primey."

04:39.417 --> 04:40.333
I'm gonna call him "Primo."

04:40.417 --> 04:42.917
We call him "Mr. Prime Minister."

-Oh, right. I need to write that down.
-[Stella] Right.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.625
Anyway, I designed this
new look for you guys

04:46.709 --> 04:48.667
because the whole world
is going to be watching

04:48.750 --> 04:50.917
and you have to look amazing
at the ceremony.

Hey, Stella.

04:52.625 --> 04:53.959
Oh, hey there, Van Dyke.

04:54.041 --> 04:55.792
Thanks for the study help this morning.

04:55.875 --> 04:57.959

I can take down two linebackers at once,

04:58.041 --> 04:59.583

all I could come up with is,

"Juliet's a girl and Romeo's a dude."

about how we're meeting
the prime minister of England tomorrow.

of Shakespeare, right?

-Huh? Hi. Sorry.

05:41.750 --> 05:44.458
I know you're tutoring Van Dyke,
but I hope you didn't forget

05:44.542 --> 05:46.208
you were gonna help me
with my math tonight.

05:46.291 --> 05:48.959
Of course I'm not going to forget.
You're my special project.

05:49.041 --> 05:51.417
Special project?
I like that.

05:52.375 --> 05:56.041
Well, if you two are done being adorable,
can we get back to the meeting, please?

05:56.125 --> 05:57.750
-Right, I'm sorry.
-Yeah. Thank you.

05:57.834 --> 06:01.208
Oh, take a look at these pants.

06:01.291 --> 06:03.875
-Those are cool...
-I know, right? Van Dyke wears those.

06:03.959 --> 06:05.500
Except for the belt loop,
the color, the fabric.

06:05.583 --> 06:06.959
On second thought, I hate them.

06:07.959 --> 06:10.500
-Well, I gotta get to class.
-I'll see you later.

06:10.583 --> 06:11.625
[Nick] See ya.

06:20.834 --> 06:24.875
I mean, I can't believe Van Dyke Tosh
thinks that he and I make a great team.

06:24.959 --> 06:27.333
I can't believe you got to
smell Nick up close.

06:27.417 --> 06:30.792
I've always imagined he smelled
like chocolate-chip cookies,

06:30.875 --> 06:32.208
sugar-free, of course.

06:32.291 --> 06:36.041
And on the other hand,
I bet you Kevin smells like heaven.

06:36.125 --> 06:38.333
And it's true because it rhymes.

06:40.125 --> 06:43.542
And the best part is
Van Dyke asked me out.

06:43.625 --> 06:45.542
Tonight he's taking me to see

06:45.625 --> 06:47.834
<i>Pretty Princess II 3-D:</i>
<i>Crowns A-poppin.</i>

06:48.792 --> 06:50.750
That's, like, a total chick flick.

06:50.834 --> 06:53.125
No guy would take a girl
to that on purpose. [laughs]

06:53.208 --> 06:56.125
Van Dyke would.
He is so romantic.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.291
I can't believe I'm going out
with the cutest guy in school.

06:58.375 --> 07:01.500
Correction, fourth cutest.

07:01.709 --> 07:03.792
Cool. Can you make
a pop-up of me and Van Dyke?

07:03.875 --> 07:08.500
Yeah... Oh, after I'm done grouting
my life-size Jonas mosaic. [chuckles]

07:09.291 --> 07:11.000
-Just a sec.
-OK.

07:14.333 --> 07:15.834
A life-size mosaic, huh?

07:22.834 --> 07:25.333
Nick, were you saying that
you were looking for Joe?

07:25.417 --> 07:27.834
-Yeah.
-I think I found him.

07:29.041 --> 07:31.417
You don't think Stella would blow me off
for a date with Van Dyke, do you?

07:31.500 --> 07:34.375
Man, this is a tough one:
the captain of the football team,

07:34.458 --> 07:37.875
a guy with banana peel
on his head in a trash can.

07:37.959 --> 07:38.792
I'm stumped.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.166
It's just that tonight
she was gonna help me with my math.

07:41.250 --> 07:42.959
Dude, I think your biggest
math problem is

07:43.041 --> 07:47.625
Joe, plus trash can, equals bonkers.
And yes, I said it!

I just want you to know
if you can't make it tonight it's cool.

08:40.542 --> 08:43.583
I mean, you know, maybe your parents
are gonna take you out to dinner,

08:43.667 --> 08:45.583
or you've found a stray possum,

08:45.667 --> 08:49.625
and you wanted to bring it home
and give it a bath, or you went surfing.

it'd be a little weird

and we live 50 miles from the sea, but...

to call my friend Stella.

09:07.834 --> 09:11.375

for a date with Van Dyke Tosh.

I heard it was really great.

that chick flick with Van Dyke.

11:50.834 --> 11:52.917
Yeah, and she's supposed to be here
helping me with important math.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.041
Why can't you study with Stella
another night?

11:55.125 --> 11:56.375
Because she should be here anyway.

11:56.458 --> 11:59.125
-Why?
-Guarding these clothes.

11:59.208 --> 12:01.291
We have to meet the prime minister
of England tomorrow.

12:01.417 --> 12:02.583
What if something happened to them?

12:02.667 --> 12:04.375
It could cause an international incident.

12:04.458 --> 12:06.375
I get it.
You're jealous.

12:06.458 --> 12:08.875
-[scoffs] Jealous of who?
-Stella and Van Dyke.

12:08.959 --> 12:11.208
Van Dyke's a dwonk.
And Stella...

12:11.291 --> 12:15.083
she's got all that luscious blonde hair,
and her skin's soft and she smells pretty,

12:15.166 --> 12:18.083
and she laughs at my jokes... gross.

12:18.166 --> 12:20.583
Poor fellow. He's so jealous,
he's just oozing green.

12:21.875 --> 12:25.583
What if somebody broke in here...
and they had this pen

12:25.667 --> 12:27.542
and they started swirling it around?

12:27.625 --> 12:30.583
-They could ruin everything.
-Like you just did?

12:30.667 --> 12:31.667
[gasps]

12:31.750 --> 12:33.917
Oh, no.
Stella's gonna kill us.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.083
Us? No, no, no. You're taking the heat
for this one, Mr. Jealous.

12:36.166 --> 12:37.208
I'm not jealous.

12:37.291 --> 12:39.542
-Whatever, jealous boy.
-Leave him alone.

12:40.542 --> 12:42.083
See ya, jealous.

12:42.417 --> 12:46.000
[Kevin grunts]
Don't use the same pole!

12:54.041 --> 12:55.834
Oh, no, no, no, no.

12:55.917 --> 12:57.750
Come on.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.333
[screams]

13:05.291 --> 13:06.583
We got your 911.
What's the emergency?

13:06.667 --> 13:08.792
-Where's Mom and Dad? Is Frankie OK?
-I got here as soon as I could.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.417
What took you all so long,
especially you?

13:10.500 --> 13:12.875
-Joe, what is it?
-We have a fashion emergency.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.875
-Are you talking about the pen mark?
-A pen mark?

13:16.959 --> 13:19.458
Joe got a pen mark on his new shirt
for the prime minister meet-and-greet.

13:19.542 --> 13:21.125
What? Joe, that shirt's a one of a kind.

13:21.208 --> 13:23.875
-It was an accident.
-[sighs] It's all right.

13:24.291 --> 13:26.083
I can get it out.
Where's the shirt?

13:28.417 --> 13:29.583
[exclaims]

13:29.667 --> 13:31.709
-Where's everything?
-OK, I can explain.

13:31.792 --> 13:34.333
By the way, anybody want anything:
soft drinks, chips?

13:34.417 --> 13:35.750
What happened to the clothes?

13:35.834 --> 13:37.500
OK, here's what happened,
I got a pen mark on the shirt,

13:37.583 --> 13:39.291
but I figured I could get it out.
But I couldn't, so I put it in the wash.

13:39.375 --> 13:41.542
-You put the shirt in the wash?
-Then it turned blue.

13:41.625 --> 13:42.583
But it didn't match the pants anymore,

13:42.667 --> 13:43.667
so I figured
I'd put the pants in the wash.

13:43.750 --> 13:46.208
-You put the pants in the wash?
-Then nothing matched anything,

13:46.291 --> 13:47.917
so I put everything in the wash!

13:48.000 --> 13:49.834
[screams]

13:50.291 --> 13:52.375
OK, Stella, take deep, slow breaths.

13:52.458 --> 13:57.083
Uh... think of a forest and bunnies
and flowers and no washing machines.

13:57.166 --> 14:01.375
-Joe, where are all the clothes now?
-In the soggy pile in the corner.

14:02.959 --> 14:04.375
[sighs]

14:08.083 --> 14:11.583
So... how was the movie?

14:16.542 --> 14:19.834
OK, I'm not sure,
but I think I might be a genius.

14:19.917 --> 14:24.166
A whole new wardrobe, and we still have
two hours to catch the plane to England.

14:24.250 --> 14:28.583
-It's gonna look great, Stells.
-Joe, I don't get it.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.583
If you didn't like the outfit
that I picked out for you,

14:30.667 --> 14:33.583
all you had to do was just talk to me
instead of ruining everything.

14:33.667 --> 14:35.667
It was an accident.
I loved those outfits.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.959
I even told the guys
you should've been here guarding them

14:38.041 --> 14:39.542
instead of going on a date with some guy.

14:40.375 --> 14:42.041
Is that what this is about?

14:42.125 --> 14:44.083
You're jealous of Van Dyke taking me out?

14:44.166 --> 14:45.750
-[both] Yes.
-No.

14:45.834 --> 14:48.000
Did you ruin
everybody's clothes on purpose?

14:48.083 --> 14:50.792
-No.
-But you ruined your clothes on purpose.

14:50.875 --> 14:52.583
-No.
-But you marked up your shirt

14:52.667 --> 14:53.625
with a pen on purpose.

14:53.709 --> 14:57.041
No comment.
Accidentally on purpose.

14:57.542 --> 14:58.500
Because?

14:58.583 --> 15:00.542
Because I didn't want you
going on a date with Van Dyke.

15:01.458 --> 15:03.709
I hear really nasty things about him, OK?

15:03.792 --> 15:06.750
Like he combs his hair
against the natural part.

15:06.834 --> 15:10.333
He has days-of-the-week underwear
and he wears them on the wrong days.

15:10.417 --> 15:13.625
-[Kevin clears throat]
-We have gym together.

15:13.709 --> 15:14.917
No, you don't.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
So you ruined my date
with the guy I've been

15:19.083 --> 15:22.375
waiting a month to ask me out
for my own good?

15:23.542 --> 15:26.458
Oh, Joe, that is so sweet of you
to worry about me like that.

15:26.875 --> 15:28.041
So we're cool?

15:28.125 --> 15:29.834
Oh, yeah.
Of course we're cool.

15:30.917 --> 15:33.125
-Go try that on.
-OK.

15:34.875 --> 15:38.500
-So, pretty mad at Joe, huh?
-Why would you say that?

15:38.583 --> 15:40.000
Oh, I don't know.

15:40.083 --> 15:41.834
[sizzling]

15:41.917 --> 15:45.083
Wow, ruining all our clothes,
messing up Stella's date.

15:45.166 --> 15:47.333
I think somebody
needs to be taught a lesson.

15:47.417 --> 15:50.583
If that fancy talking means
having fun with Joe, then I am so in.

15:50.667 --> 15:54.625
Have I ever told you guys...
that I love you?

15:56.834 --> 15:58.667
[chuckling]

15:59.500 --> 16:02.542
[chuckling continues]

16:03.291 --> 16:04.750
What are you doing?

16:18.041 --> 16:19.500
-Hey. Joe's changing?
-[Kevin] Yes.

16:19.583 --> 16:21.500
OK, you guys have
a good one, all right?

16:21.583 --> 16:25.375
Nick, just keep it light.
Kevin, don't embarrass America.

16:25.458 --> 16:26.291
Well, you both look great.

16:26.375 --> 16:28.375
All right, now,
when the Big Man says go, you go.

16:28.458 --> 16:29.625
[Nick] Yes, sir.

16:29.709 --> 16:31.208
[door closes]

16:31.959 --> 16:34.458
Joe, are you having trouble
finding your outfit?

16:34.542 --> 16:35.875
I laid it out on the chair.

16:37.166 --> 16:39.125
But this isn't the outfit
that I had on at home.

16:39.208 --> 16:41.041
Oh, I know, but luckily

16:41.125 --> 16:44.583
when you accidentally-on-purpose
ruined your shirt... brainstorm.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.917
OK, but am I wearing this right?

16:53.208 --> 16:54.208
Mm-hmm.

16:55.166 --> 16:57.625
I don't know.
It just kinda seems out there.

16:57.709 --> 16:59.625
-Why, Joe, it's amazing.
-You look so good. I mean...

16:59.709 --> 17:02.917
-Why are they not wearing this?
-Joe, because it's totally you.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.750
You're the frontman, man.
You're, like, in the middle.

17:04.834 --> 17:06.458
-It's the light, that...
-I mean, I can't believe I didn't

17:06.542 --> 17:07.625
-think of lime-green pants before.
-The shoes, the sparkle.

17:07.709 --> 17:08.542
It really itches.

17:08.625 --> 17:11.333
I mean, it is cutting edge,
all the rage in England right now.

17:11.417 --> 17:13.417
Man, you know,
if there's any edge to cut, Joe,

17:13.500 --> 17:15.458
you're cutting it right now,
because it's just that good.

17:15.542 --> 17:17.083
Like, look how sharp...
Ow, I'm hurt.

17:17.166 --> 17:18.625
[Nick]
He's actually cut right now.

17:18.709 --> 17:20.709
You know what? I see it now.

17:20.792 --> 17:22.000
-[Nick] Yeah.
-Yeah, I see it.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.041
I see it.
How can you not see it?

17:23.125 --> 17:25.375
-It makes you so tall, too.
-Stella, are you sure about this?

17:25.458 --> 17:29.208
Of course, I'm sure.
Joe... in 30 seconds,

17:29.291 --> 17:32.834
you've got a date
with the prime minister of England.

17:32.917 --> 17:36.750
And nothing's going to break that date
except an emergency.

17:37.667 --> 17:41.125
Have you got an emergency
that's going to break a date, Joe?

17:41.208 --> 17:42.375
Do you think he gets it yet?

17:42.458 --> 17:44.667
Be patient.
Five, four, three...

17:44.750 --> 17:46.375
-Wait a minute.
-[Nick] Two, one.

17:46.458 --> 17:48.583
-You are mad at me!
-And he gets it.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.583
-Ow!
-Of course, I'm mad at you.

17:50.667 --> 17:52.542
How dare you butt into my personal life?

17:52.625 --> 17:55.000
My personal life
is none of your business.

17:55.083 --> 17:57.250
On the door to my personal life it says,
"Keep out, Joe."

17:57.333 --> 17:58.750
-[grunts]
-Ow!

17:58.834 --> 18:00.792
-They're ready for you, guys.
-Let's go.

18:00.875 --> 18:04.125
Whoa, whoa, no.
Joe, hi, what are you doing?

18:04.208 --> 18:07.667
[overlapping dialogue]

18:07.750 --> 18:09.375
-[whistles]
-[Joe grunts]

18:09.417 --> 18:12.208
OK, look, there is no time, all right.
So, here's what's gonna happen:

18:12.291 --> 18:14.917
We're going out there with you as is

18:15.000 --> 18:17.667
and you're gonna meet the prime minister,
a man we don't keep waiting.

18:17.750 --> 18:21.709
All right, if feathers get ruffled,
I... I... I will smooth out the feathers.

18:22.500 --> 18:23.583
Let's go.

18:25.542 --> 18:30.125
-At least take off the hat.
-No, it's gonna ruin the whole look.

18:30.208 --> 18:31.875
I hate to say it, but she has a point.

18:36.291 --> 18:39.000
Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.
Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.

18:39.083 --> 18:41.709
Prime minister. Prime minister.
Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.

18:41.792 --> 18:43.750
-Prime minister...
-Stay.

18:44.625 --> 18:47.291
Ladies and gentlemen,
her majesty the queen!

18:47.375 --> 18:49.709
-Her what, the who?
-What happened to the prime minister?

18:49.792 --> 18:51.291
The prime minister overdid it

18:51.375 --> 18:53.208
at the bangers-and-mash festival
this morning.

18:53.291 --> 18:55.625
Her majesty graciously
interrupted her tour

18:55.709 --> 18:57.750
of the Academy of Lovable
Cockney Street Urchins

18:57.834 --> 18:59.875
to present you with your commendations.

18:59.959 --> 19:02.125
Joe, Joe, get out of here!

19:02.208 --> 19:04.041
You can't be dressed like that
in front of the queen.

19:04.125 --> 19:06.291
Too late.
The Redcoats are coming.

19:06.959 --> 19:09.291
In recognition of your efforts

19:09.375 --> 19:12.333
on behalf of the
Royal Children's Hospital,

19:12.417 --> 19:17.542
we present to you
these commendations of merit.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.917
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

19:21.458 --> 19:23.500
Joe, she didn't even notice
your outfit, dude.

19:24.709 --> 19:28.542
-Oh, we noticed.
-It was kind of just a joke.

19:28.625 --> 19:31.667
We are not amused.

19:36.959 --> 19:40.291
Hey, if she throws you in a dungeon,
can I have your new guitar?

19:42.709 --> 19:43.709
What?

19:51.041 --> 19:53.083
I can never show my face in public again.

19:53.166 --> 19:56.083
Not even.
Everybody says the ceremony was a hit.

19:56.166 --> 19:58.625
People love it that Jonas
doesn't take itself too seriously.

19:58.709 --> 20:00.083
You're welcome.

20:00.166 --> 20:02.166
Yeah, check out this
fan letter I just got, OK.

20:02.250 --> 20:05.834
"The silkworm, native to many
regions of China, starts his day..."

20:06.500 --> 20:09.500
This is...
This is my biology report.

20:09.583 --> 20:12.709
That must mean
I gave the fan letter to Mrs. Kapp.

20:12.792 --> 20:15.291
Oh, no, this is not gonna
get me more than a B-plus.

20:17.625 --> 20:21.834
Stella, I am really sorry about
spoiling your date with Van Dyke.

20:21.917 --> 20:23.458
I have no idea what I was thinking.

20:23.542 --> 20:27.417
I've said it probably 400 times now,
but I'm really sorry.

20:28.083 --> 20:29.709
-Let's make a deal.
-OK.

20:29.792 --> 20:32.959
From now on, we stay
out of each other's personal lives.

20:33.041 --> 20:37.083
-If that's what you want.
-Well, isn't that what you want?

20:38.208 --> 20:39.667
Of course that's what I want.

20:39.750 --> 20:43.000
Me too.
What I want... that.

20:46.959 --> 20:49.625
[both] Oh, oh, oh, ah-choo!

20:50.792 --> 20:52.375
Dude, you will never believe
what I just heard.

20:52.458 --> 20:53.375
Remember that girl that we saw--

20:53.458 --> 20:54.709
The really hot one
we saw in the cafeteria

20:54.792 --> 20:55.917
with the red dress, the headband,

20:56.000 --> 20:58.291
with the little daisies on her nails,
ordering the cranberry muffin?

20:58.709 --> 21:01.792
-It was a bagel, but anyway...
-Oh, OK.

21:01.875 --> 21:03.875
I overheard her telling her friend
she's gonna ask you out on Saturday.

21:05.125 --> 21:07.750
Uh... not... not this Saturday.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.166
Why not? I'm free.

21:10.208 --> 21:13.291
Have you not seen this?
This is a fashion emergency.

21:13.375 --> 21:16.000
I mean, I can't have people thinking
that I designed this look for you.

21:16.083 --> 21:17.792
My reputation would be ruined.

21:17.875 --> 21:22.041
Hey, Stells,
free for a movie Saturday night?

21:22.125 --> 21:26.792
Then I thought we could hit up the mall
so everyone could check out my new look.

21:26.875 --> 21:30.375
-Uh...
-Great idea.

21:30.458 --> 21:31.834
We should double-date.

21:32.667 --> 21:34.000
See you Saturday.
