Yeah, all right.
I'll see you later.

00:37.800 --> 00:38.920
Cheers. Bye.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.240
Who was that?

00:42.400 --> 00:44.520
That was, uh, Trish, the
coma patient's daughter.

00:44.680 --> 00:46.680
She's popping in
later this afternoon.

00:46.840 --> 00:49.280
What? She's never
been in before.

00:49.440 --> 00:52.096
You're going to have to move all
that stuff out of the room, aren't you?

00:52.120 --> 00:53.840
[Sighs] I'm not
bloody pickfords!

00:54.000 --> 00:55.680
I really need an office.

00:55.840 --> 00:57.600
I'm going to crowbar
that door open.

01:27.880 --> 01:28.920
[Den sighs]

01:30.480 --> 01:33.040
Bollocks, I got
17% for my essay.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.400
Den: Aw.

01:34.560 --> 01:37.480
[Scoffs] Much help Damaris was.

01:37.640 --> 01:39.720
Den, can I put my dr
pepper in your fridge?

01:39.880 --> 01:42.800
Mmm, whatever. Although
there will come a time, you know...

01:42.960 --> 01:46.320
Yes, when your breasts are all
full up and squirting everywhere.

01:46.480 --> 01:48.000
Yes, happy days.

01:48.160 --> 01:49.920
Den: Don't be grumpy!

01:50.080 --> 01:51.960
You're looking a bit
pleased with yourself.

01:52.120 --> 01:53.840
I'm just looking at
pictures of the weekend.

01:53.960 --> 01:55.440
What?

01:55.600 --> 01:57.880
Aiden took me away.
We went to Norway.

01:58.040 --> 02:00.760
- Cor, you kept that quiet!
- Well, it was a surprise.

02:00.920 --> 02:04.280
I didn't know it was going to
happen. It was to celebrate the baby.

02:04.440 --> 02:05.720
Bloody hell!

02:05.880 --> 02:08.440
It was really nice of him.
He paid for everything.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.000
Upgrades, flights, hotels.

02:11.160 --> 02:13.720
We went to see the northern
lights. They didn't come out.

02:13.880 --> 02:15.720
But that was fine, it
didn't really matter.

02:15.880 --> 02:19.240
[Stammering] Den, I'm sorry, I don't
want to be mean, but, you know...

02:19.400 --> 02:22.280
Stuff's crap for me at the
moment. I've got no money,

02:22.440 --> 02:25.960
no fags, no mentor,
no time to myself.

02:26.120 --> 02:28.960
From where I'm standing,
life couldn't be any more shit.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.560
Yeah, sorry.

02:30.720 --> 02:32.640
-Oh, I take that back. Here comes Karl Marx.
-Mmm.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.760
Den: You need to get
your bum under there, Kim.

02:36.840 --> 02:38.720
Under. Further, further.
Get your bum under.

02:38.880 --> 02:41.800
Don't think I can't see
you there, you class traitor.

02:41.960 --> 02:45.960
Kim: Oh, hello, Megan.
Sorry, how did the strike go?

02:46.120 --> 02:48.400
Megan: A decent turnout,
actually, no thanks to you.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.440
I just dropped by to let
you have one of these...

02:50.560 --> 02:54.280
Hospital Christmas card competition
from the kids' oncology ward.

02:54.440 --> 02:57.680
What's the prize, then, a
go on their play-doh factory?

02:57.840 --> 02:59.000
Don't be cynical, Kim.

02:59.160 --> 03:02.040
Oh, Megan, look, um, it arrived.

03:02.200 --> 03:04.040
- Ooh. Amica?
- Den: Yeah.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.896
- Oh, that's a good make, that, isn't it?
- Den: Yeah.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.680
- Megan: Good, can I have a look?
- Yeah.

03:07.840 --> 03:08.840
Megan: Are these yours?

03:08.920 --> 03:10.240
Den: No, those
are Kim's actually.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.520
I'm afraid that's
not allowed, Kim.

03:12.680 --> 03:15.240
Items appertaining solely to
the staff member's childcare,

03:15.400 --> 03:17.200
if I'm not mistaken.

03:17.360 --> 03:20.080
Well, the staff member's child
isn't going to be here for six months.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.200
Give em here, I
need cheering up.

03:22.360 --> 03:23.920
Den: Oh, Doris.

03:24.080 --> 03:27.120
[Sighs] What are
you doing out of bed?

03:27.280 --> 03:30.520
Come on, let's get you back. Why
haven't you got your slippers on? Hmm?

03:30.680 --> 03:31.896
You need to put your slippers on

03:31.920 --> 03:33.240
if you're going
to get out of bed.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.600
Right, come on, in you get.

03:39.040 --> 03:41.120
You have a little rest.

03:41.280 --> 03:44.080
Right. Where's Damaris? I
need to give her one of these.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.400
- Gone.
- Gone where?

03:46.560 --> 03:48.480
She's got a job as a
nurse-bot on a space station

03:48.640 --> 03:50.880
- orbiting the planet zarg.
- Megan: Pardon?

03:51.040 --> 03:53.400
Den: No, she's gone to a
London teaching hospital.

03:53.560 --> 03:55.720
- She got a promotion.
- Megan: Very nice.

03:55.880 --> 03:57.560
Hang on a minute.
You told me that you...

03:57.720 --> 03:59.720
Den: No.

03:59.880 --> 04:03.720
She beat me to it, she had already
applied for some fancy post, so...

04:03.880 --> 04:07.400
Well, now that Damaris is
gone, couldn't you be my mentor?

04:07.560 --> 04:11.400
I'd love to, but unfortunately
I've got netball three nights a week

04:11.560 --> 04:14.880
and then there's my msc and
then there's my book club, so...

04:15.040 --> 04:16.280
You're supposed to support me.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.560
I do. Believe me, I do.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.240
You know what?

04:20.400 --> 04:22.600
I'm going to forget about
this whole bloody doctor thing.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.440
Mmm, good, it's
probably for the best.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.096
You don't seem too hot
on the commitment thing.

04:26.120 --> 04:28.320
Well, why should I
bother? I'm going to give up.

04:28.480 --> 04:31.320
I think you'd be much
happier, Kim. Honestly, I do.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.800
Right. I'm off. I'll
call back later, den.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.896
I've discovered a couple of
more things you can claim for.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.760
Oh, great, thanks.

04:39.160 --> 04:40.360
- Megan: Morning, Donald.
- Hi.

04:41.440 --> 04:43.000
- Den: Oh, hi, Donald.
- Hiya.

04:43.160 --> 04:44.600
- Had it mended?
- Yes.

04:44.760 --> 04:47.320
Mmm.

04:47.480 --> 04:50.160
- Where are we going to put it?
- I don't know.

04:50.320 --> 04:52.400
Shall I move the fridge?

[Keyboard clacking]

05:02.840 --> 05:04.600

05:04.760 --> 05:07.000
What do you think about this
Christmas card competition?

05:07.160 --> 05:09.120
Den: Yeah, could be good, yeah.

05:09.280 --> 05:11.160
I reckon we could design
something really nice.

05:11.320 --> 05:13.240
We could use one of
yours and Aiden's photos,

05:13.400 --> 05:15.560
you know, from your
weekend in trollfjord.

05:15.720 --> 05:17.680
- Den: Mmm.
- Oh, shouldn't that be "trroll-fjurd"?

05:17.720 --> 05:19.840
It's an archipelago in
the north of Norway.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.400
Uh, gents, quite interesting,
you don't need to write it down.

05:22.520 --> 05:24.320
Den's just has been
on a mini-break there.

05:24.480 --> 05:25.976
Ah, all right. Did you
enjoy yourself, den?

05:26.000 --> 05:28.240
-Oh, yeah. It was great, actually. Yeah.
-Pippa: Good.

05:28.400 --> 05:32.600
Look, we went on a sleigh ride
all the way to the ice hotel. See?

05:32.760 --> 05:35.360
But, unfortunately, it was fully
booked up when we got there, so...

05:35.480 --> 05:37.640
Good. Um, have you seen Josh?

05:38.840 --> 05:40.056
- Yeah, I saw him.
- Pippa: Oh, yes?

05:40.080 --> 05:42.000
He was down in reception,
on his way to bonjour.

05:42.160 --> 05:45.360
Bloody hell, this one's more like one
of dr Moore's research photos, look.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.880
Den: Kim! Can you
please give me that? Sorry.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.320
Please do not show pictures
of me in my bra and pants

05:50.480 --> 05:52.480
to members of the
junior medical staff.

05:52.640 --> 05:55.480
Well, I mean, at least they're not
all grey and washed out, like mine.

05:58.240 --> 06:01.600
Hansley. Hello, I just wanted to say
thank you so much for all your help,

06:01.760 --> 06:04.120
it's been absolutely invaluable.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.880
So you went for
minton versus minton?

06:06.040 --> 06:08.560
Yes, yes, we did. Well, it was
a bit of a nightmare in the end...

06:08.720 --> 06:10.720
Philip tried to get a second
valuation on the house

06:10.840 --> 06:13.400
and, uh, he even had his
lawyers sniffing round my vag-at

06:13.560 --> 06:15.440
to see if there was
any money there, so...

06:15.600 --> 06:18.160
But you know, in the end,
we went for the clean break.

06:18.320 --> 06:19.600
And your life, not overshadowed

06:19.760 --> 06:21.440
by the relationship
that's broken down?

06:21.600 --> 06:23.040
That's how lord
scarman described it.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.240
Well, I might just
take him up on that!

06:25.400 --> 06:27.520
Uh, anyway,
that's it, it's, uh...

06:28.160 --> 06:30.520
It's over. Uh...

06:30.680 --> 06:33.680
Oh, by the way, my solicitor said
she might have something for you.

06:33.840 --> 06:34.840
I don't know if, uh...

[Speaking French]

06:38.200 --> 06:39.440
[Speaking French]

06:43.480 --> 06:45.800
She's given me, um, her number.

06:45.960 --> 06:49.040
If you give her a ring, she might
be able to find you something.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.520
- [Chuckles]
- That's her number.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.000
- Merci. thank you.
- Worth a call.

06:54.160 --> 06:56.840
I just think it's important
someone behaves honourably in...

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
In all of this mess.

06:59.160 --> 07:00.296
You know. But,
anyway, that's it.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.760
It's over and, um...

07:04.280 --> 07:06.040
Thank you very much indeed.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.320
It's not a problem. Thank you.

07:17.720 --> 07:20.200
Um, den, isn't this the lady
that was discharged recently?

07:20.360 --> 07:23.880
Yes. Um... it's mrs dethick, yes. And
she's been readmitted from a&amp;E.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.680
I've a terrible
ache in my left side.

07:26.840 --> 07:29.960
Is it, uh, in the same place
as last time, when we found...

07:30.120 --> 07:32.336
- There wasn't anything wrong, was there?
- Yes... no, below that one.

07:32.360 --> 07:33.576
- Den: Not as such, no.
- It's lower down.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.440
Megan: It's lower
now, is it? All right.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.496
Well, uh, sister, do you want to
sort out the obs for this lady and...

07:37.520 --> 07:38.600
- Yes.
- And, um...

07:38.760 --> 07:40.056
Kim, can you sort
out the obs, please?

07:40.080 --> 07:43.040
And we'll pop back
later. Okay. Jolly good.

07:44.280 --> 07:45.840
Ah, didn't see you pop in there.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.600
Oh, you've decided
to join us, have you?

07:47.760 --> 07:49.520
Yes, sorry.

07:49.680 --> 07:51.360
Right, speak to
you about this later.

07:52.520 --> 07:54.680
We're going to see mrs rivers.

07:54.840 --> 07:58.760
- All-righty. Good. So hello, Mrs... Ms rivers.
- Hello.

07:58.920 --> 08:00.280
Rivers: Is mummy coming?

08:00.440 --> 08:02.920
Den: Yes, mummy is coming.
Mummy's going to come soon.

08:03.080 --> 08:04.720
She's not coming, is she, den?

08:06.200 --> 08:08.336
Um, you shouldn't, uh, well,
if the mother's not coming...

08:08.360 --> 08:09.840
- What?
- Not literally coming, no.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.800
It might be in a vision of some
kind, or a dream or something.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.760
Well, you don't know...

08:14.920 --> 08:19.160
I would like some sweeties.
I want some sweeties.

08:19.320 --> 08:22.480
You're in hospital for a nasty
abscess on your bottom. All right?

08:22.640 --> 08:23.856
I just need to
have a quick look.

08:23.880 --> 08:25.920
Rivers: No, I want
some sweeties.

08:26.080 --> 08:30.920
Oh, yes... no, we haven't,
got any... Any sweeties.

08:31.080 --> 08:33.040
I've got a boost.

08:33.200 --> 08:36.880
I've got hundredweight of
Murray mints and a fudge bar.

08:37.040 --> 08:38.360
Megan: No, neither
of these are...

08:39.720 --> 08:42.680
Den: Oh, thank you
so much, dr imbaca.

08:42.840 --> 08:46.056
- Here we are, the nice doctor has given you some sweets.
- Um, is she diabetic, then?

08:46.080 --> 08:47.720
No, she's not diabetic,

08:47.880 --> 08:49.696
I wouldn't have given her
sweets if she had been diabetic.

08:49.720 --> 08:52.096
Right. All right, well, you know,
this may make her more amenable.

08:52.120 --> 08:54.800
If the sweets don't work, we
might think about a mild sedative,

08:54.960 --> 08:56.640
then we can have a
jolly good look at her.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.176
I don't know if you wanted to
have a quick word with mrs patput,

08:59.200 --> 09:00.656
- she's leaving today.
- Ah, yes, of course she is.

09:00.680 --> 09:02.800
Yes, you're off,
aren't you, mrs patput.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.920
Um, well, you're
looking wonderfully well,

09:05.080 --> 09:06.960
uh, wish you the best of luck.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.656
Yes, your husband's phoned, he's
going to be in at 12:00 to pick you up.

09:09.680 --> 09:11.160
Right, so don't
keep him waiting.

09:11.320 --> 09:12.760
Thank you.

sorry I was late today.

excuse for being late today?

09:17.560 --> 09:19.840
Intern: My sister
swallowed a pen lid.

Megan: Your sister
swallowed a pen lid?

09:22.040 --> 09:25.800
You're going to have to think of
something a little bit better than that.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.360
Do you want me to treat you to
a cuppa in chatters later, Kim?

09:28.440 --> 09:31.360
We can go and have a look through
those pictures for the competition.

Well, I was thinking about
having another crack at my essay,

09:34.200 --> 09:37.080
but maybe it's
not even worth it.

09:37.240 --> 09:40.440

sad loss to nursing, really, wouldn't it?

09:40.600 --> 09:42.840

hospital corners and all that.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Sarky!

somewhere for you to stay, I mean...

No. No, no, honestly. It's fine.

- What about that one?

09:59.160 --> 10:00.440
[Both laugh]

10:00.600 --> 10:03.280
Oh, my... that's quite rude.

10:03.440 --> 10:06.240
Oh, well, you can only
see a bit of the crease.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.680
So, Josh, our vag-at
is on the march,

10:08.840 --> 10:11.760
so it's sub-folder
c, document pm27.

10:11.920 --> 10:15.160
Click, move, drop into the
wallet, control, exit, click,

10:15.320 --> 10:17.520
drag into memory stick and exit.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.576
All right, so I'll leave
that little project with you.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.600
Any problems, just ask
one of the nursing staff.

10:33.560 --> 10:35.000
Are you all right, doctor?

10:44.920 --> 10:47.640
Oh, yeah. Oh, what about this
one, Kim? That's a good one.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.760
Look, you've got all the
sleigh dogs, the husky dogs.

10:50.920 --> 10:52.736
Oh, it just looks really
lovely, doesn't it? The snow...

10:52.760 --> 10:54.360
The snow's a bit
yellow there, though.

10:54.960 --> 10:56.360
Oh.

10:56.520 --> 10:58.880
Is it? Oh, yeah.

10:59.040 --> 11:01.440
Well, maybe you could
Photoshop that, or something.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.720
All right. I'll have a go.

11:03.880 --> 11:07.320
The last break I had was two
days in aberystwyth in a caravan.

11:07.480 --> 11:09.080
It pissed down the whole time.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.080
Oh, I hate it when that happens.

11:13.840 --> 11:14.840
[Sighs]

11:16.840 --> 11:19.960
Den, I can't work out how
to put letters on this card.

11:20.120 --> 11:23.560
Oh, it's easy, Kim. Look,
you just... Firstly you do...

11:23.720 --> 11:25.000
No, don't tell me how to do it.

11:25.160 --> 11:26.800
Can you just do
it for me, please?

11:26.960 --> 11:28.920
Den: [Sighs] Swap over.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.920
- Here you go, this is for you.
- Den: Oh, it's my free water.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.360
Thank you so much.

11:37.520 --> 11:38.656
- It's my free water, Kim.
- Kim: Lovely.

11:38.680 --> 11:40.280
- See you.
- Den: Bye!

11:40.440 --> 11:43.280
You can help yourself.
You need rehydration.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.960
No, thanks. I'll
have my dr pepper.

11:46.120 --> 11:49.000
Kim, do you think I
should put that up to a 22?

11:49.160 --> 11:51.000
It's 18 and a bit at the moment.

11:51.160 --> 11:52.600
Does that mean bigger?

11:52.760 --> 11:53.840
- Yeah.
- Yeah, bigger.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Bigger.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.120
- Den: Ooh, that's it.
- Oh, that's perfect.

11:59.160 --> 12:00.960
Oh, I'll tell you what,

12:01.120 --> 12:03.296
there's a career for you at Clinton
cards if it all goes tits up here.

12:03.320 --> 12:05.456
Den: Can you sort that, then,
and I'll get on with the drugs round?

12:05.480 --> 12:07.080
Kim: All right.

12:07.240 --> 12:09.840
Give us a handful of
anti-depressants for Dave, will you?

12:10.000 --> 12:11.680
Den: Oh, why?

12:11.840 --> 12:14.216
Kim: Oh, he's so bloody miserable
because he ain't got a job yet.

12:14.240 --> 12:15.720
Driving me mad.

12:15.880 --> 12:18.320
- Den: Oh, it's rotten, isn't it?
- Yeah, it is rotten.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.800
- Den: Not fair, somehow.
- [Sighs]

12:20.960 --> 12:22.440
Donald, is that you?

12:22.600 --> 12:24.280
Yeah, hello, it's Kim here.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.680
Yeah, can you pop
down? Pick something up.

12:26.840 --> 12:28.880
About ten minutes,
yeah? Brilliant, bye.

12:35.240 --> 12:37.360
[Gentle snoring]

13:14.720 --> 13:16.120
Ah, hansley.

13:16.280 --> 13:18.040
Um, did you speak to Jenny?

13:18.200 --> 13:19.480
- Uh, yes.
- Right.

13:19.640 --> 13:21.760
And did she have a job
for you at the solicitor's?

13:21.920 --> 13:23.480
Yes, it's an internship.

13:23.640 --> 13:25.280
- Good salary?
- Expenses.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.760
Oh.

13:28.920 --> 13:31.000
Will you be able to
afford to... to do it?

13:31.160 --> 13:34.720
I'm not sure... Maybe I'll get a
job in the evening or something...

13:34.880 --> 13:36.320
Mmm.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.136
Oh, well, look, perhaps
this is, uh, will help.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.800
Um, something towards, uh...

13:39.960 --> 13:42.560
Oh, no, no, thank you.
I cannot accept that.

13:42.720 --> 13:45.400
Oh, please, hansley, for goodness'
sake, you know, please do.

13:45.560 --> 13:47.240
- You're terribly helpful.
- No...

13:47.400 --> 13:49.000
- Thank you.
- Do... with my...

13:49.160 --> 13:50.800
Thank you, I cannot
accept that, thank you.

13:55.360 --> 13:58.760
Shall I give it to something like
the African, uh... Childhood trust?

13:58.920 --> 14:02.800
Or education or...
Um... in your name?

14:02.960 --> 14:04.920
Okay, yeah. Yes.

14:20.920 --> 14:23.200
Den, mrs patput's gone.

14:23.360 --> 14:26.360
- Oh, was her husband early?
- No, no, no!

14:26.520 --> 14:28.400
Like gone, like "gone
to heaven" gone.

14:30.040 --> 14:31.680
Are you sure?

14:31.840 --> 14:34.280
Well, I think so.

14:34.440 --> 14:37.400
She'd just had one
of Josh's Percy pigs.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.520
What a lovely last
meal that is, isn't it?

14:53.840 --> 14:55.760
A bit sudden.

14:55.920 --> 14:58.216
Oh, it's going to be a terrible
shock for her husband, innit?

14:58.240 --> 15:00.960
Kim: Hmm. Oh, I hope
he hasn't left home yet.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.080
Right.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.200
Oh, I'll ring for a doctor.

15:07.920 --> 15:10.000
Hi, ward k2 here. Yeah,

15:10.160 --> 15:13.440
can we have a doctor, please?
Yep. As soon as you can, thank you.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.240
- Den...
- Oh, hi, hilary.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.840
- Have you got those keys I lent you last night?
- Oh, yeah...

15:18.000 --> 15:19.560
Hello, Kim.

15:19.720 --> 15:22.720
Hi, hilary. Yeah, um,
the keys for the, um...

15:24.400 --> 15:26.280
Keys for the,
um... For the office.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.760
- Uh, no. No, I haven't.
- Right.

15:28.920 --> 15:31.640
- Um...
- Have you tried down at the Porter's office?

15:31.800 --> 15:33.200
Hilary: No.

15:33.360 --> 15:36.200
Um, yes, I'll... I'll try
them, thanks. Thank you.

15:37.440 --> 15:40.240
- Ooh, someone's been busy.
- Kim...

15:40.400 --> 15:44.000
- No, honestly, it's not what you think.
- What do I think it is?

15:44.160 --> 15:46.320
- You think we're back together.
- Are you?

15:46.480 --> 15:47.680
No, of course not!

15:48.960 --> 15:51.080
Give us a hand here, Kim.

15:51.240 --> 15:54.880
Hilary: Listen, can I just say,
Kim, this is not what you think it is.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.520
Yeah, I've already said that.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.400
Hilary: Okay.

16:07.080 --> 16:09.320
Can you get that pillow
out from under, please?

16:11.640 --> 16:12.880
Thank you.

16:13.720 --> 16:14.720
[Typing]

16:18.360 --> 16:20.280
Den: Oh, have you got
mrs patput's notes there?

16:20.440 --> 16:22.480
- I have, yeah.
- What year was she born again?

16:22.640 --> 16:24.680
Uh, 1934.

16:24.840 --> 16:26.760
Oh, hang on! 1934...

16:31.200 --> 16:32.280
[Sighs]

16:34.000 --> 16:35.880
That would've freaked
me out if that had worked.

16:35.960 --> 16:36.960
Den: Mmm.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.800
- Denise, could I have a word, please?
- Yes, fire away, yeah.

16:45.960 --> 16:50.960
I'm wearing my oncology ward Christmas
card competition facilitator hat here.

16:51.120 --> 16:52.880
Oh, god, have I won?

16:53.040 --> 16:54.800
What do you mean, "have I won"?

16:54.960 --> 16:56.520
"Have we won?" Surely?

16:56.680 --> 16:59.520
So you were involved
in this farrago, were you?

16:59.680 --> 17:03.440
Has that speccy sister of Ben Nevis
won? She's so ambitious, isn't she?

17:03.600 --> 17:06.600
I don't know if this is your
idea of some kind of sick joke,

17:06.760 --> 17:10.000
but I've just been in oncology
and someone has sent them in

17:10.160 --> 17:12.880
an obscene picture for the
Christmas card competition.

17:13.040 --> 17:16.600
- [Laughs] - Kim, I told you
not to go through my phone.

17:16.760 --> 17:18.400
If you've submitted
one of those pictures,

17:18.480 --> 17:20.680
I swear I am not going to
speak to you again. Honestly...

17:20.720 --> 17:25.000
Den, I swear, no, I did not. I put
the doggy-snowy-boring one in.

17:25.160 --> 17:28.840
Luckily for you, they seem
to have taken it in good spirit.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.120
Surprisingly good
spirit, actually.

17:31.280 --> 17:35.200
But the fact is, this could
have been a very serious matter.

17:35.360 --> 17:38.360
Now, I'm prepared not to take it any
further so long as I have your assurance

17:38.440 --> 17:40.440
that I'll have your
fullest support in future

17:40.600 --> 17:42.560
- as union branch secretary?
- Yes, you do.

17:42.720 --> 17:44.840
Thank you.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.440
Ah, Josh, I need to check something
in file two, please, if you don't mind.

17:49.600 --> 17:52.640
That's it. No, that's it, that's it on
the top, yes, thank you so much.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.840
Sorry, I didn't
mean to be, um...

17:55.000 --> 17:57.176
Oh, and by the way, thank you
so much for your Christmas e-card.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.040
Uh, it was very nice...

17:59.200 --> 18:01.480
Rather early, but, uh...

18:01.640 --> 18:03.520
You did send me a
Christmas card, did you?

18:04.080 --> 18:05.600
Oh, dr Moore...

18:05.760 --> 18:09.480
Sorry. I think one of your
large-format vulval c-types

18:09.640 --> 18:11.040
has been sent down
to kids' oncology

18:11.080 --> 18:12.720
for the Christmas
card competition.

18:15.080 --> 18:16.240
No, I'm really not with you.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.400
I mean, Kim... Kim,
you could explain...

18:18.560 --> 18:23.000
I did not send it. All I did was, I got
the memory stick out of the computer,

18:23.160 --> 18:25.960
gave it to Donald and he
took it down. It's not my fault.

18:26.120 --> 18:29.120
Are you telling me
that we are dealing here

18:29.280 --> 18:31.640
with a picture of
a patient's vulva?

18:31.800 --> 18:33.480
Might have been a Toyota previa.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.240
[Kim laughs]

18:36.400 --> 18:37.856
Den: It's just a mix-up,
Megan, honestly.

18:37.880 --> 18:39.920
- Megan: It's not funny.
- Oh, come on!

18:40.080 --> 18:43.800
- It is not funny.
- It's a hospital, Megan, for god's sake!

18:43.960 --> 18:47.960
People see pictures of other
people's parts everywhere, on posters...

18:48.120 --> 18:50.696
Someone might have had a laugh, it
might have cheered them up, for god's sake.

18:50.720 --> 18:53.240
Well, it is not as funny as
that for the person involved

18:53.400 --> 18:55.440
because this is a
data protection issue.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.880
As far as I'm concerned, this
is a private information issue

18:59.040 --> 19:02.080
which nurse wilde has violated.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.880
I think you will agree, dr Moore,
that the vulva belongs to somebody

19:04.960 --> 19:06.760
and we need to find
out who that belongs to...

19:06.800 --> 19:08.960
Megan: The vulva is
anonymous at this stage.

19:09.120 --> 19:12.320
We've got to apologize to
whichever unfortunate individual

19:12.480 --> 19:13.800
has appeared in this picture.

19:13.960 --> 19:15.576
Den: Well, how are we ever
going to know who that is?

19:15.600 --> 19:16.856
I mean, they all
look very similar.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.520
No, no, no... It's
a blind study, so...

19:18.680 --> 19:21.880
Well, look, I have a
copy of the picture here.

19:22.040 --> 19:25.680
We can have a look at it and
maybe somebody will recognize it.

19:25.840 --> 19:27.280
Kim: I wouldn't know
mine from Adam.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.320
Would you recognise yours?

19:29.480 --> 19:32.360
I don't think that's appropriate,
necessary or certainly not amusing, Kim.

19:32.520 --> 19:33.960
I'm sorry. Actually,
could we do this

19:34.120 --> 19:36.056
somewhere more private,
please, if it concerns my research?

19:36.080 --> 19:37.080
Megan: Absolutely.

19:37.160 --> 19:38.600
Let's all go to my office.

19:39.240 --> 19:40.560
Thank you, Josh.

19:42.840 --> 19:45.480
So are we off to view the
privates in private, then, Megan?

19:45.640 --> 19:47.680
Oh, Kim, you just
are beyond the pale.

19:47.840 --> 19:50.480
Megan: Josh, just don't
say anything, all right,

19:50.640 --> 19:52.720
this is not your fault, just
absolutely, you know...

19:57.120 --> 20:01.680
Right, what is Paramount here
is that my research is not affected.

20:01.840 --> 20:06.200
Well, um, dr Moore, how many
specimens or samples or whatever...

20:06.360 --> 20:08.640
- How many did you have?
- Um, about 30.

20:08.800 --> 20:11.360
Oh, shavings, we'll
never identify it.

20:11.520 --> 20:14.240
No, that's quite severe
labial deterioration.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.240
Um, it looks familiar...

20:16.400 --> 20:17.920
Could it be, um...

20:24.200 --> 20:25.840
I suppose...

20:26.000 --> 20:28.800
Yes, I can confirm that is
indeed the lady in question.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.040
That's good, at least we
know whose whatsit it is.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.080
Ms Hughes,

20:33.240 --> 20:36.001
my research funding is absolutely
vital to the future of this hospital.

20:36.080 --> 20:38.960
I think you will agree it would
be foolhardy to put that at risk

20:39.120 --> 20:42.480
by some kneejerk admission
by a staff member when...

20:42.640 --> 20:44.400
Megan: Dr Moore,
may I remind you

20:44.560 --> 20:47.480
that I am the union rep on
the data protection committee,

20:47.640 --> 20:50.840
and we are duty bound to
disclose to patients or their relatives,

20:51.000 --> 20:53.600
whenever information pertaining
to a patient has been stored.

20:53.760 --> 20:55.096
Ah, well, it's hardly
been stored...

20:55.120 --> 20:56.480
Dr Moore, if
you'd let me finish?

20:56.640 --> 20:59.440
Now, were there ever to be
an appeal or a dpa hearing,

20:59.600 --> 21:03.040
I would be for the chop had I not acted
properly and in accordance with the law,

21:03.200 --> 21:05.440
and, frankly, that's not a
risk that I'm prepared to take.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.760
But what does that
actually mean, Megan?

21:07.920 --> 21:10.600
It means, nurse wilde, what
we have to tell the patient.

21:10.760 --> 21:12.560
We have no choice.

21:12.720 --> 21:13.856
Oh, well, then, we'll have to
tell the daughter, won't we?

21:13.880 --> 21:15.800
Pippa: Ah, no, no,
no, not necessarily, no.

21:15.960 --> 21:20.240
Um, mrs McIntosh, uh, is in a coma
and current orthodoxy suggests that, uh,

21:20.400 --> 21:22.120
she can hear
everything that we say.

21:22.280 --> 21:26.440
So I concur with ms Hughes
here that we simply tell the patient.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.560
- So...
- But if she can't acknowledge

21:28.720 --> 21:32.440
that she's heard the apology, then,
I'm sorry, we have to tell the relative.

21:32.600 --> 21:35.400
Yes, well, she's coming in this
afternoon, so that's lucky, isn't it?

21:35.560 --> 21:37.200
Megan: Good. Kim:
I'm not so sure, though.

21:37.320 --> 21:39.840
I mean, no-one knows
how she's going to react.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.120
No, exactly. As the consultant, I
will make the decision on this one.

21:43.280 --> 21:44.520
Uh, not in this case, dr Moore.

21:44.640 --> 21:47.120
Data protection outweighs
your authority, I'm afraid.

21:47.280 --> 21:49.000
It's like a game of
top trumps, innit?

21:49.160 --> 21:51.320
- Kim, I've warned you.
- Sorry.

21:51.480 --> 21:54.560
Nurse Hughes, are you saying
that you're prepared to put at risk

21:54.720 --> 21:57.840
the career of a very promising
young medical student

21:58.000 --> 21:59.720
simply to score a few points?

21:59.880 --> 22:02.200
They're not my rules, dr
Moore, I just abide by them.

22:02.360 --> 22:05.440
Oh, this is absolute nonsense!

22:05.600 --> 22:07.280
What time did you say
she's coming in, Kim?

22:07.360 --> 22:08.800
Oh, about 4:00.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.456
Den: Well, that means you're
going to do it then, are you?

22:10.480 --> 22:12.000
You're going to
make the apology?

22:12.160 --> 22:14.880
Oh, no, not me. I just
provide administrative support.

22:15.040 --> 22:17.360
No, no, as this is strictly
speaking still a medical matter,

22:17.520 --> 22:19.440
then one of you
needs to do that.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.560
But don't worry, I'll be
there, as an observer,

22:21.720 --> 22:23.760
to monitor the
compliance procedure.

22:25.960 --> 22:26.960
[Sighs]

22:30.320 --> 22:31.680
[Exhales]

22:36.480 --> 22:38.480
Do you think you'd manage
a cup of tea, mrs dethick?

22:38.600 --> 22:41.440
- I might.
- [Exhales]

22:41.600 --> 22:43.640
- Ms keys, there you are now.
- Thank you very much.

22:43.760 --> 22:45.976
Den: I've given you a second sugar today.
- Mrs keys: Oh, thank you.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.400
Right, uh, mrs McIntosh's
daughter is waiting in chatters.

22:49.560 --> 22:51.080
Den: Why, what did she say?

22:51.240 --> 22:53.320
Well, nothing. It's not my
place to tell her anything.

22:53.480 --> 22:55.800
Right, shall we
get this over with?

22:55.960 --> 22:57.040
I'll go and get her.

23:02.680 --> 23:03.680
Oh!

23:10.560 --> 23:11.680
Megan: Here we are.

23:11.840 --> 23:13.880
Ah, uh, good
afternoon, ms McIntosh.

23:14.040 --> 23:18.200
Hello. Is anything wrong? Only I've not
got long, I'm on a single bloody yellow.

23:18.360 --> 23:20.120
Ah, yeah, unfortunately,
I'm afraid there is.

23:20.280 --> 23:22.840
- You're not turning mother off, are you?
- Uh, well...

23:23.000 --> 23:26.680
I know this sounds harsh, but
I think I could just about cope.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.200
It's not really a
question about...

23:28.320 --> 23:30.216
Would I actually be
required to turn off a switch?

23:30.240 --> 23:32.840
- I don't think I could do that.
- Oh, no, no, ms McIntosh...

23:33.000 --> 23:35.760
No question of you turning switches off. No.
- Oh.

23:35.920 --> 23:37.920
Pippa: Shall I start
the ball rolling? Um...

23:38.080 --> 23:40.480
- I'm happy not to.
- Megan: Go ahead, dr Moore.

23:40.640 --> 23:45.240
Ms McIntosh, I'm afraid there
has been a small clerical error

23:45.400 --> 23:46.800
on the part of
the nursing staff...

23:46.960 --> 23:48.520
And the medical staff.

23:48.680 --> 23:50.320
Pippa: Thank you, nurse wilde.

23:50.480 --> 23:52.376
I think perhaps I'd better deal with this.
- Kim: And gladly.

23:52.400 --> 23:57.200
You'll remember I asked, uh, you for
your permission to include your mum

23:57.360 --> 23:59.760
in my vital medical research...

23:59.920 --> 24:01.640
Yes, yes, a photo.

24:01.800 --> 24:03.656
- I'd rather not think about it.
- Pippa: I understand.

24:03.680 --> 24:06.280
Um... now, I'm afraid there
has been a slight confusion

24:06.440 --> 24:09.360
which has resulted in a
picture of your mother's, um...

24:09.520 --> 24:11.480
Vulva.

24:11.640 --> 24:15.120
Uh, being, uh, distributed around
the hospital via the intranet...

24:15.280 --> 24:16.800
In the form of a Christmas card.

24:20.520 --> 24:22.760
[Laughs hysterically]

24:23.680 --> 24:24.680
[Chuckles]

24:27.400 --> 24:30.480
- [Laughter continues] - Pippa:
So we just wanted to... Apologise.

24:31.080 --> 24:32.400
Um...

24:34.640 --> 24:36.320
Would you like
to sit down, or...

24:36.480 --> 24:38.440
Thank you. [Snickering]

24:45.600 --> 24:47.560
Well, you got away with
it this time, Kim, my girl,

24:47.600 --> 24:49.160
but let this be a warning.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.920
Kim: I'm not a girl.

24:57.880 --> 25:01.400
Um, den, could I... Have you
had mrs dethick's test results back?

25:01.560 --> 25:02.776
- I just want to check those...
- Den: Bloods?

25:02.800 --> 25:03.856
- Yes, please, before I head off.
- Yes.

25:03.880 --> 25:04.880
Thank you.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.360
Den: Yep. Here we are.

25:06.520 --> 25:09.200
- Pippa: Mmm-hmm.
- [Den speaking indistinctly]

25:09.840 --> 25:11.360
Right. Oh, dear.

25:11.520 --> 25:13.320
- Den: Yes, that's rather clear.
- Mmm.

25:13.480 --> 25:16.440
- Do we have the ct scan, is that on here?
- Den: Um...

25:16.600 --> 25:18.200
- [Keyboard clacking]
- Hang on a minute.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.520
- Pippa: Ah.
- Oh, dear.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.800
Yes, that's pretty
clear, isn't it?

25:24.960 --> 25:26.760
Right, do you want to
come through with me?

25:29.600 --> 25:32.720
- Um, hello, mrs dethick.
- Hello.

25:32.880 --> 25:34.760
How are you feeling?

25:34.920 --> 25:36.200
Well, I've still got a pain.

25:36.360 --> 25:40.520
Mmm, mmm, you will
have. Um, thank you, sister.

25:41.880 --> 25:43.760
Um...

25:43.920 --> 25:47.840
Results are back and,
well, not really good news,

25:48.000 --> 25:51.760
but, uh, it turns out that
you were, um, right all along.

25:51.920 --> 25:54.800
Um, I'm afraid there is
something wrong with you.

25:54.960 --> 25:56.240
I knew it, I knew that.

25:56.400 --> 25:59.760
Mmm, I'm afraid the
most likely, um, scenario

25:59.920 --> 26:01.920
is that you have a
tumour on your liver.

26:02.080 --> 26:03.440
- Oh.
- I'm sorry about that.

26:04.520 --> 26:05.320
Mmm.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.520
[Exhales]

26:06.680 --> 26:08.120
I'm all right.

26:08.280 --> 26:10.200
Would you like a few minutes?

26:10.840 --> 26:13.840
No. No, no.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.360
Would you like, uh, sister to
perhaps, um, stay with you?

26:17.520 --> 26:19.920
- Um...
- No, no.

26:20.760 --> 26:22.000
No, it's okay.

26:22.160 --> 26:23.800
You seem very sanguine. Um...

26:25.760 --> 26:27.080
Well, I...

26:29.000 --> 26:31.320
I'm really pleased...

26:31.480 --> 26:33.680
[Crying] I'm really
pleased that I was right.

26:39.360 --> 26:43.200
Jolly good. All right, I'll leave
you with sister and I'll see you later.

26:43.360 --> 26:45.240
- All right?
- Mmm, thank you.

26:45.400 --> 26:47.520
Pippa: Thank you. All-righty.

26:49.760 --> 26:51.600
Den: Are you all
right, mrs dethick?

26:51.760 --> 26:53.640
Yes, I'm fine!

26:53.800 --> 26:57.480
I'm just pleased that I was right.
You see, nobody believed me.

26:57.640 --> 26:59.400
- I always believed you.
- Did you?

26:59.560 --> 27:01.280
I always believed
you, mrs dethick.

27:01.440 --> 27:05.200
I've been saying to the doctor
from the first time you came in...

27:05.360 --> 27:08.200
- Mrs dethick: Oh!
- That you knew what you were talking about.

27:08.360 --> 27:09.640
I'm so glad!

27:09.800 --> 27:11.920
- I felt like an idiot, you see.
- Den: No.

27:12.080 --> 27:14.040
You always had me on
your side, mrs dethick.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.640
Mrs dethick: Thank
you, thank you.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.120
Percy pig?

27:46.280 --> 27:48.160
Pippa: Mmm. No, thank you.

28:32.760 --> 28:34.440
Kim?

28:34.600 --> 28:35.760
