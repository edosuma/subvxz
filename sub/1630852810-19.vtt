WEBVTT

00:21.980 --> 00:22.897
What?

00:23.898 --> 00:24.816
What?

00:25.483 --> 00:27.652
- What?
- Stop saying, "What?"

00:27.736 --> 00:29.404
What?

00:29.904 --> 00:31.322
Leavo's a Trøg!

00:31.406 --> 00:32.323
Wait a minute.

00:32.407 --> 00:35.118
We're all Trøgs. Elves are Trøgs.

00:36.286 --> 00:38.038
And Trøgs are elves.

00:38.121 --> 00:40.248
- What about molemen?

00:40.331 --> 00:42.375
Nobody cares about molemen.

00:45.962 --> 00:49.382
And there's one person…
well, elf… well, Trøg…

00:49.466 --> 00:53.011
Well, whatever the hell he is,
we have to thank for dedicating decades

00:53.094 --> 00:54.929
to the search that would unite us all,

00:55.013 --> 00:56.931
Dread Pirate Leavo.

00:59.184 --> 01:00.810
I wasted my life.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.271
Oh! How can you say that, Leavo?

01:03.354 --> 01:05.815
- What about your children?
- They won't speak to me.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.693
What about that fantasy novel
you were writing?

01:08.777 --> 01:11.279
Eh, the elf erotica market
is oversaturated.

01:11.362 --> 01:14.324
What about that girlfriend
you always talked about?

01:14.407 --> 01:15.700
She married Speako.

01:15.784 --> 01:18.328
Boy, you did waste your life.

01:30.882 --> 01:33.092
You're not gonna get away this time, Mom.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.656
Gotcha! Ow!

01:57.033 --> 01:58.576
God damn it! Ugh!

02:00.620 --> 02:01.788
Bunty's on break.

02:01.871 --> 02:03.665
Shall I send her in for you to yell at?

02:03.748 --> 02:04.666
No, you'll do.

02:04.749 --> 02:07.252
I can't figure out what these dreams mean.

02:07.335 --> 02:08.628
What happened to my lucky boot?

02:08.711 --> 02:10.839
Where's Mora? Where's Oona's stash?

02:10.922 --> 02:12.132
What's the point of anything?

02:12.215 --> 02:14.092
Only you can answer those questions,

02:14.175 --> 02:15.927
except for the one about Oona's stash.

02:16.010 --> 02:18.555
It was mostly catnip,
and Scruffles smoked all of it.

02:20.932 --> 02:23.810
You have no idea
what's going on in my head, Mop Girl.

02:23.893 --> 02:24.936
I have no control.

02:25.019 --> 02:26.771
Not when I'm sleeping, not when I'm awake.

02:26.855 --> 02:29.357
Are you kidding me?
You're the queen of Dreamland.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.608
You control everything.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.318
Maybe you should look beyond yourself

02:32.402 --> 02:35.029
and stop acting like a spoiled,
entitled brat.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.823
My crown doesn't even fit.

02:37.365 --> 02:43.079
From this night forward, I hereby declare
the elves and Trøgs are reunited.

02:43.162 --> 02:44.289
Throw down your arms.

02:48.334 --> 02:52.130
You're all welcome to stay for
our prayer meeting and success seminar.

02:52.213 --> 02:53.798
Success seminar?

02:53.882 --> 02:57.260
We just remembered
we all have something else to do. Run!

02:58.136 --> 02:59.846
Where do you think you're going, bub?

02:59.929 --> 03:03.016
But there are so many secrets I have
to blab back to Bean.

03:03.099 --> 03:05.435
- I mean…
- We have bigger plans for you.

03:05.518 --> 03:06.853
No, no!

03:06.936 --> 03:09.522
No! No!

03:13.776 --> 03:16.070
But why do I have to go to school?

03:16.154 --> 03:18.698
I'm almost fourteen and a half,
middle-aged.

03:18.781 --> 03:20.366
I left the woods for this?

03:20.450 --> 03:23.286
Because I want you two to grow up
to be gentlemen.

03:23.369 --> 03:26.539
And that means no fighting or shovin'.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.666
- Now, get in there.

03:28.750 --> 03:32.962
Phew! Good thing I ordered all schools
to be built next to these things.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.051
To daytime drinking
and parental neglect!

03:40.178 --> 03:42.722
- Hello, boys and girls and Jerry.
- Hello.

03:42.805 --> 03:44.349
I'm your substitute teacher.

03:44.432 --> 03:46.017
Where's Mrs. Gladstone?

03:46.100 --> 03:47.602
She's out dead today.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.855
Executed her meself.

03:50.939 --> 03:53.983
Her last words were, "Turn to page 52."

03:54.067 --> 03:57.028
Just kiddin'. It was, "No! Oh!"

03:57.111 --> 04:00.114
On a related note,
never try to start a teachers' union.

04:00.198 --> 04:01.908
That's just going to be a bad idea.

04:08.831 --> 04:11.668
Hmm. Nerd bait. Schloop!

04:12.919 --> 04:15.129
Gee willikers, this place is spiffy.

04:15.213 --> 04:17.090
All we have in Hell is a little hot stuff.

04:17.173 --> 04:21.135
I pity the fool
who drinks the Goo!

04:21.219 --> 04:23.179
I pity the fool who drinks the Goo!

04:23.263 --> 04:25.890
No, I won't drink the Goo.
You can't make me.

04:25.974 --> 04:28.559
I'll scream for help
and won't stop screaming.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.938
Fill his mouth with golf balls.

04:32.021 --> 04:32.855
What?

04:36.234 --> 04:37.151
Schloop!

04:39.445 --> 04:41.489
Your Majesty,
you've gotta stay focused.

04:41.572 --> 04:44.993
Don't get distracted by the stupid crap
that happens when you least expect it.

04:45.076 --> 04:48.037
Bean, Bean! Elfo can fit seven golf balls
in his mouth.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.914
Oh, man. What an idiot.

04:49.998 --> 04:53.334
The Trøgs got him all tied up,
hand and foot, and even blindfolded.

04:53.418 --> 04:56.004
My hunch is they're gonna
skin him alive and roast him. Woo!

04:56.087 --> 04:57.588
That's horrible.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.674
Damn, Luci, you don't care about anyone.

04:59.757 --> 05:02.135
Aw, Bean, that hurts my feelings.

05:02.218 --> 05:03.803
Let me show you how much I care.

05:07.265 --> 05:09.100
Hello, baby.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.026
Wait, stop!

05:22.822 --> 05:25.033
Sorry, impacted anal gland.

05:25.116 --> 05:26.200
God, enough!

05:26.284 --> 05:27.952
We gotta save Elfo.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.038
To the little door.

05:31.789 --> 05:32.957
Oh, yeah.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.586
All right, let's get started
with mathematics.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.171
- Ugh!
- Math!

05:38.254 --> 05:42.175
If you throw a 137-pound witch
down a well that's 40 feet deep,

05:42.258 --> 05:44.927
and her falling velocity
is nine meters per second,

05:45.011 --> 05:47.180
how long will it take
for the witch to drown?

05:48.014 --> 05:48.848
I don't know.

05:48.931 --> 05:52.977
Trick question!
Witches don't drown, only the innocent do.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.562
Yay!

05:56.272 --> 05:57.440
Luci, I'll never fit.

05:57.523 --> 05:59.692
Don't worry.
The tunnel is covered in slime.

05:59.776 --> 06:00.985
You'll schloop right through.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.030
- Ew.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.866
- Ew.
- Buh-bye.

06:06.949 --> 06:08.534
- Ew, ew, ew!

06:08.618 --> 06:10.370
Ew, ew, ew…

06:25.676 --> 06:28.012
- Ew.
- Took you long enough.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.931
What? There were stairs?

06:30.014 --> 06:31.557
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Yeesh.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.059
Then I'd have to talk to you.

06:33.142 --> 06:34.310
Oh, crap. I'm doing it now.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.813
Yeah, everything's
a big laugh for you, isn't it?

06:36.896 --> 06:38.815
- You're toxic.
- Man, you're cranky.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.650
Look, I know you miss your mermaid, Bean,

06:40.733 --> 06:43.528
but I got a blowfish here
that might do the trick.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.113
Pucker up.

06:48.741 --> 06:49.575
Hey!

06:49.659 --> 06:52.995
You know what? Screw you
and your hacky prop humor, okay?

06:53.079 --> 06:54.747
I'll go save Elfo myself.

06:56.290 --> 06:59.836
Why does everyone get so mad when
I put 'em through the tunnel of mucus?

07:03.965 --> 07:08.636
Say, boys, how'd you like to play
a little game called Board Silly?

07:08.719 --> 07:11.055
- Well, that sounds friendly enough.
- How do you play?

07:11.139 --> 07:13.391
We hit you with a board, silly!

07:13.474 --> 07:14.767
- Ow!

07:15.893 --> 07:18.438
Ow! What's a board?

07:21.774 --> 07:23.484
You know what our problem was?

07:23.568 --> 07:25.319
We brought knuckles to a board fight.

07:25.403 --> 07:28.531
You keep whimpering like that,
I'll give you a good slapping myself.

07:28.614 --> 07:31.617
Oh! I wish we had another friend
to fight with us.

07:31.701 --> 07:35.621
Did someone say
they needed a friend?

07:35.705 --> 07:38.416
- Whoa!
- 'Cause I ain't available.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.587
I didn't know these dolls were alive.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.630
Have they been watching us
this whole time?

07:44.714 --> 07:45.715
I wish.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.341
No, they're just toys.

07:47.425 --> 07:50.303
I spent my whole lonely childhood
praying they would talk,

07:50.386 --> 07:53.764
and then they just sat there motionless,
even when I burned 'em.

07:54.348 --> 07:55.433
I'm Freckles.

07:55.516 --> 07:58.394
Don't you see?
Your pathetic wish brought me to life,

07:58.477 --> 08:01.814
so I could be your
enchanted little dancing wooden buddy.

08:01.898 --> 08:04.650
It's like one of
them disturbing fairy tales

08:04.734 --> 08:07.403
with dark psychological symbolism.

08:07.486 --> 08:09.655
I'm going to have nightmares tonight.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.407
Oh, yes, you are.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.910
With a big skillet, too. Ha!

08:13.993 --> 08:14.911
Yeow!

08:14.994 --> 08:19.207
Meh! But right now, it sounds like
you could use some advice

08:19.290 --> 08:22.251
on how to deal with those
mean old street bullies.

08:22.335 --> 08:26.797
Wait, is this going to be a lecture
on how violence is never the answer?

08:26.881 --> 08:31.093
Hell no. I'm going to teach you
to fight dirty.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.888
Those little alley squirts are going down.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.102
Ow! My elbow rods.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.313
I like him. He's a wild card.

08:48.069 --> 08:48.945
Oh!

09:10.591 --> 09:11.467
Hup, hup.

09:13.469 --> 09:16.347
Hup, hup.
Hup, hup. Hup, hup.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.579
Place Elfo on the slab.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.463
We're gathered here
on this beautiful, balmy evening

09:49.547 --> 09:53.175
in Mosquito Meadows
to give Elfo the ultimate test.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.176
What?

09:54.260 --> 09:55.886
Now, bring on the Goo.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.513
Goo!

09:57.597 --> 10:01.517
For only the one true savior
can use the ultimate power of the Goo

10:01.601 --> 10:03.102
to save us all.

10:03.185 --> 10:04.937
We already tried it on the demon Luci.

10:05.021 --> 10:08.566
It gave him wings,
but beyond that… eh, not so much.

10:08.649 --> 10:09.942
Now it's Elfo's turn.

10:10.026 --> 10:13.195
Who knows what could happen?
He could turn into a Trøg like Leavo.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.698
It is not the character arc
I had hoped for.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.075
Or he could be the one true savior.

10:18.159 --> 10:22.121
And who better to perform this test
than a fellow savior, Bean.

10:22.204 --> 10:24.040
- Me?
- Come on out, Bean.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.500
It's not like we didn't see
your big, honking head there.

10:26.584 --> 10:30.546
Look, whatever is going on here,
you are not Trøgifying Elfo.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.757
That's right, Tiabeanie. You are.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.134
- Now, get to it.
- And if I won't?

10:39.221 --> 10:41.057
You both die, sassy.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.017
That's what saviors do anyway, right?

10:45.645 --> 10:47.772
Okay, okay. Chill. I'll do it.

10:50.775 --> 10:53.861
You know what? Let me just make sure
his clamps are nice and tight.

10:53.944 --> 10:56.238
Elfo, what are you doing?
You look ridiculous.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.616
I'll stall 'em as long as I can.

10:58.699 --> 11:00.201
You squirm your way out of there, okay?

11:00.284 --> 11:02.453
- I can't.
- You're squirming right now.

11:02.536 --> 11:04.288
That's 'cause there's ants on the slab.

11:04.372 --> 11:05.915
Here we go with the ants again.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.876
If you didn't eat cookies in bed,
you wouldn't have the ants.

11:08.959 --> 11:10.544
Do you think they followed me here?

11:10.628 --> 11:12.296
I do have crumbs in my pockets.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.923
Ugh! You and your ants.

11:15.257 --> 11:18.719
Come on, Bean. Pour the Goo
and watch the magic.

11:18.803 --> 11:21.347
Magic… That's the whole problem
with this Kingdom.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.224
What has magic given us?

11:23.307 --> 11:26.102
Curses, lies, evil puppets.

11:26.185 --> 11:31.232
But Stience has given us buzzbrighters
and ass chariots and handguns.

11:31.315 --> 11:34.485
Stience makes you smarter,
and magic makes you crazy.

11:34.568 --> 11:36.195
So please, I beg you.

11:36.278 --> 11:37.488
Resist temptation.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.782
Give up the Goo. Who's with me?

11:42.410 --> 11:45.454
The crickets have spoken.
Now, give him the Goo.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.882
And snatch.

11:57.717 --> 11:58.843
Careful, Bean.

11:58.926 --> 12:01.679
Luci, you're the best… and the worst!

12:03.305 --> 12:04.348
Fling!

12:09.186 --> 12:10.771
Moon!

12:13.232 --> 12:14.900
God, you two are fat.

12:14.984 --> 12:15.943
We're gonna make it.

12:16.026 --> 12:18.070
What did I tell you
about positive thinking?

12:23.367 --> 12:24.577
Quick, grab that rope!

12:24.660 --> 12:26.746
- Well, ya missed it, stupid.

12:39.800 --> 12:40.634
Ow.

12:42.553 --> 12:43.679
This is too much.

12:44.513 --> 12:45.848
I'm going to bed.

12:45.931 --> 12:48.267
Thanks, Luci.
You really came through today.

12:48.350 --> 12:51.395
Just this once. Next time, Elfo dies.

12:51.479 --> 12:52.521
Deal. Hmph.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.482
You just sold me Elfo's soul.

12:54.565 --> 12:55.858
Deal. What?

13:04.784 --> 13:06.911
Hey, look, they're back for more.

13:06.994 --> 13:08.662
And they brought their dummy with them.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.665
I ain't no dummy. I'm an action figure.

13:11.749 --> 13:14.502
And we figure you're due for some action.

13:14.585 --> 13:17.087
- Uh-oh.
- They got wordplay.

13:18.881 --> 13:24.136
Sticks and stones may break our bones,
but pipes will cause real damage.

13:34.522 --> 13:38.150
Damn! No wonder they call you
Derek the Jerk Slayer.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.277
- But they don't.
- They will now.

13:40.361 --> 13:42.446
Let's scram. Somebody carry me.

13:45.574 --> 13:48.285
I don't think we're going
for ice cream later.

13:50.037 --> 13:52.164
Oh, man, oh, man. I killed an elf.

13:52.248 --> 13:53.499
What am I going to do?

13:53.582 --> 13:56.710
Well, first of all,
stop wavin' the lead pipe around.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.587
You're gettin' blood on everybody.

14:00.005 --> 14:00.839
Ow.

14:00.923 --> 14:05.553
Derek, you only got one option,
clear out of town.

14:05.636 --> 14:07.847
If I was you, I'd change my name.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.808
Change my personality, too. Yeesh.

14:10.891 --> 14:11.809
You're right.

14:11.892 --> 14:14.228
To protect society, I must go.

14:14.311 --> 14:18.816
Destined to wander alone,
town to town, solving people's problems,

14:18.899 --> 14:20.818
inadvertently making them worse.

14:23.404 --> 14:26.574
No, Bear Boy.
There's no reason for you to go, too.

14:26.657 --> 14:27.700
Sure, there is.

14:27.783 --> 14:29.535
You may be only my half-brother,

14:29.618 --> 14:31.871
but I kind of like hanging out
with that half.

14:34.623 --> 14:38.252
I'd better come, too,
'cause you two dimwits is hopeless.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.882
Hey, Freckles. Derek's my guy, yeah?

14:43.966 --> 14:47.636
So, whatever angle you're working here,
I expect a sizable cut.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.647
We sure showed them.

14:59.773 --> 15:02.443
You guys go steal a fancy getaway carriage

15:02.526 --> 15:05.821
while I make sure those palookas
don't give us no more trouble.

15:09.325 --> 15:13.329
Eh, thanks for playing along
with my sick little games, fellas.

15:13.412 --> 15:14.496
Mmm.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.126
It was worth the brain damage.

15:21.712 --> 15:24.673
You boys ever play a game
called Pipe Down?

15:24.757 --> 15:26.216
- I haven't.
- Me neither.

15:26.300 --> 15:27.468
How do you play?

15:40.356 --> 15:41.190
Whoa!

15:44.985 --> 15:48.948
They think telling me I might be
the one true savior is going to tempt me?

15:49.031 --> 15:50.949
Well, they don't know me very well.

16:00.626 --> 16:01.543
Hmm.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.474
Bleh.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.569
Goo!

16:36.120 --> 16:37.913
I've got you now, Mom.

16:39.415 --> 16:40.582
What the hell!

16:41.583 --> 16:42.876
Crazy, right?
