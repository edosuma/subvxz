WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.570
(birds chirping)

00:06.873 --> 00:09.243
(growling)

00:11.679 --> 00:13.913
(grunts)
Nnrrf!

00:13.946 --> 00:15.583
Nnrrf!

00:15.615 --> 00:18.352
Oh, God. Demon, demon.
What kills a demon?!

00:18.385 --> 00:21.655
(grunting)
Nnrrf!

00:21.689 --> 00:23.056
Nnrrf!

00:23.091 --> 00:24.658
Oh, nerf.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.493
Not nerf. Knife!

00:26.527 --> 00:28.027
(grunts)

00:28.062 --> 00:29.629
(growling)

00:36.436 --> 00:39.606
Okay. That was too close
for comfort.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.442
Not that slaying's
ever comfy, but...

00:42.475 --> 00:44.244
You know
what I mean?

00:44.277 --> 00:45.779
(sighs)
If you guys hadn't
been here to help...

00:45.813 --> 00:47.115
WILLOW:
But we were.

00:47.148 --> 00:49.450
And we did.
And-and we're all fine.

00:49.482 --> 00:51.884
(sighs)
Isn't he gonna go poof?

00:51.918 --> 00:54.121
Um, I guess
these guys don't.

00:54.155 --> 00:56.557
We'll have to bury him
or something.

00:56.590 --> 00:57.957
(groans)

00:57.990 --> 00:59.960
Makes you appreciate
vamps though.

00:59.993 --> 01:01.561
No fuss, no muss.

01:01.594 --> 01:03.231
So how come Faith
was a no-show?

01:03.264 --> 01:05.799
I thought mucus-y demons
were her
favorites.

01:05.832 --> 01:08.569
Couldn't reach her.
Again.

01:08.602 --> 01:11.239
She hasn't been
hanging out much.

01:11.272 --> 01:13.307
I detect
worry.

01:13.340 --> 01:14.742
A little bit.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.576
Slaying's a rough gig.

01:16.609 --> 01:18.412
Too much alone time
isn't healthy.

01:18.445 --> 01:20.647
Stuff gets pent up.
We should try

01:20.680 --> 01:22.216
to do more
socializing with her.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.317
XANDER
Well, burial
detail aside,

01:24.352 --> 01:27.120
does this cap us off
for the day?

01:27.155 --> 01:29.289
You got plans?

01:29.323 --> 01:32.659
I cannot stress enough
how much I don't have plans.

01:32.692 --> 01:34.128
No luck reaching Cordelia?

01:34.162 --> 01:36.796
I've left a few messages.

01:36.829 --> 01:39.799
60. 70.

01:39.832 --> 01:42.135
But you know
what really bugs me?

01:42.170 --> 01:44.572
Okay, we kissed.
It was a mistake.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.406
But I know that was
positively the last time

01:46.439 --> 01:48.408
we were ever gonna kiss.
Darn tootin'.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.144
And they burst in,
rescuing us,

01:50.177 --> 01:51.645
without even knocking?

01:51.679 --> 01:55.915
I mean, this is really
all their fault.

01:55.948 --> 01:58.686
Your logic does not resemble
our Earth logic.

01:58.718 --> 02:00.453
Mine is much more advanced.

02:00.487 --> 02:03.022
At least tomorrow's
Monday,
another school
day.

02:03.055 --> 02:05.459
Well, that's
good.
You know, focus on school.

02:05.492 --> 02:07.760
That's the Strong Willow way
to heal.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.763
Actually, I was more thinking
Oz will be there,

02:09.795 --> 02:11.965
and I can beg for
forgiveness.

02:11.998 --> 02:14.201
That works, too.
I...

02:14.235 --> 02:16.637
I want to be Strong Willow.
But then I think

02:16.670 --> 02:19.306
I may never get to be close
to Oz again,

02:19.340 --> 02:22.842
and it's like all the air
just goes out of the room.

02:22.876 --> 02:25.346
I know the feeling.
XANDER
Right.

02:25.378 --> 02:27.381
I mean, you went
through it with Angel,

02:27.414 --> 02:29.182
and you're
still
standing.

02:29.216 --> 02:32.385
So tell us, wise one,
how do you deal?

02:32.420 --> 02:36.356
I have you guys.

02:36.389 --> 02:38.192
(answer machine beeps)
Hey, it's Xander.

02:38.225 --> 02:39.992
If you get this, call me.

02:42.396 --> 02:45.966
(beep)
Hi. Xander.

02:45.998 --> 02:49.969
I, uh... Well, I'm in
if you feel like talking.

02:50.002 --> 02:52.605
Bye.
(sighs)

02:55.175 --> 02:57.076
(beep)

02:57.110 --> 02:59.513
Hi, Cordelia. Um...

02:59.546 --> 03:01.348
if you get the chance,

03:01.382 --> 03:03.783
if we can talk, I'm here.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.722
(beep)

03:08.756 --> 03:10.723
Hey, again. It's me.

03:10.758 --> 03:14.294
I'm here. Again.

03:20.533 --> 03:23.603
(wolf howling)

03:23.637 --> 03:25.739
*

04:14.253 --> 04:16.656
(indistinct chatter)
Hey, man. What's up?

04:23.029 --> 04:24.432
How's it
goin'?

04:24.464 --> 04:25.899
Oz hasn't been
to his locker.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.401
There may be books in there
that he needs.

04:28.435 --> 04:31.639
But, still, he doesn't come.

04:31.672 --> 04:34.173
Has Xander
seen Cordelia?
I don't think so.

04:34.206 --> 04:36.175
But she is coming in today.

04:36.209 --> 04:39.312
Amy saw her last night
at the mall.

04:39.346 --> 04:40.747
How was she?

04:40.781 --> 04:42.350
I don't know.

04:42.382 --> 04:45.485
Amy said she looked
pretty... scary.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.954
*

04:58.499 --> 05:00.867
(murmuring)

05:05.372 --> 05:07.107
That's what I heard, too.
I mean, it's
just,

05:07.139 --> 05:08.875
like, really
deep.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.946
Cordelia!

05:12.980 --> 05:15.048
You look
amazing.

05:15.081 --> 05:16.384
(kissing)

05:16.417 --> 05:18.519
Oh. You have
to meet Anya.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.521
She just moved here,

05:20.553 --> 05:22.956
and her dad just bought--
what was it--

05:22.990 --> 05:26.526
oh, a utility.
Or something.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.728
Nice bag. Prada?

05:28.762 --> 05:31.163
Good call.
Most people around here

05:31.197 --> 05:33.733
can't tell Prada from
Payless.
God,
Cordy,

05:33.766 --> 05:35.134
when I heard about...

05:35.168 --> 05:36.970
Well, I mean,
I
couldn't believe it.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.305
But it was smart, you
know, the injury
thing.

05:39.338 --> 05:42.042
(chuckles)
You take a week off,
let everybody forget

05:42.074 --> 05:45.245
about the temporary insanity
that was Xander Harris.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.146
Xander who?

05:47.180 --> 05:48.649
Oh!
(chuckles)
(chuckling)

05:48.682 --> 05:50.050
(chuckles)

05:50.082 --> 05:51.819
You know what
you have to
do.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.586
Start dating.

05:53.620 --> 05:56.223
Get back
on the horse.
Oh, absolutely!

05:56.255 --> 05:58.558
I am ready to ride!
Then I have

05:58.591 --> 06:01.928
just the stallion.
He's so you.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.800
(slurping)

06:12.072 --> 06:16.709
(chuckles)
I'm pretty sure he
won't cheat on
you.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.446
At least, not
for a while.

06:18.478 --> 06:21.449
Plus, he's got
a kill moped.

06:21.481 --> 06:23.417
(chuckles)

06:23.451 --> 06:25.886
(chuckling)

06:29.723 --> 06:31.925
(slurping)

06:31.959 --> 06:34.394
(indistinct chatter)

06:38.798 --> 06:41.534
Oz.
Wow.

06:41.569 --> 06:44.103
Look at us,
running into each other,

06:44.137 --> 06:46.372
as two people who go
to the same school

06:46.406 --> 06:48.808
are so likely to do
now and then.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.612
Hey.

06:52.612 --> 06:54.314
Oz, wait.

06:54.346 --> 06:56.884
Please
What I did...

06:56.917 --> 06:59.487
When I think that I hurt you...

06:59.519 --> 07:01.788
Yeah. You said all this stuff
already.

07:01.822 --> 07:06.059
Right. But... I want
to make it up to you.

07:06.093 --> 07:10.663
I mean, if you let
me, I want to try.

07:10.697 --> 07:13.500
Just...

07:13.533 --> 07:15.334
You can leave me alone.

07:18.004 --> 07:19.839
I need to figure things out.

07:19.872 --> 07:21.675
But maybe if we talk about
it,

07:21.709 --> 07:24.310
we
could...
Look,

07:24.343 --> 07:27.146
I'm sorry this is hard for you.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.917
But I told you what I need.

07:29.949 --> 07:33.353
So I can't help feeling
like the reason you want to talk

07:33.386 --> 07:36.824
is so you can feel
better about yourself.

07:36.856 --> 07:39.158
That's not my problem.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.973
(indistinct chatter)

08:02.348 --> 08:05.117
Hey. John Lee.

08:05.151 --> 08:08.588
Do I have something
caught in my teeth?

08:22.903 --> 08:25.137
So... what's new?

08:25.172 --> 08:27.574
God, it's been, like,
a gazillion years.

08:27.608 --> 08:30.677
Look, the guys are kind of down
on me lately.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.679
Coach just cut me back
to second string.

08:32.712 --> 08:35.716
If anyone saw me hanging
with Xander Harris' castoff

08:35.749 --> 08:38.384
on top of that...
Death, you know?

08:38.418 --> 08:40.988
But... maybe.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.490
If you want to go
someplace private...

08:44.524 --> 08:47.027
What?

08:47.059 --> 08:49.461
Think about
it.

08:52.799 --> 08:54.934
Oh.
Hey.

08:54.967 --> 08:58.437
Go ahead. Dazzle me with
your oh-so-brilliant insult.

08:58.471 --> 09:00.106
Just join the
club.

09:00.139 --> 09:02.909
Hardly. Uh, actually,
I've been looking for you.

09:02.942 --> 09:05.111
Ever since we met
this morning, I was like,

09:05.144 --> 09:06.947
"Thank God there's one
other person in this town

09:06.980 --> 09:08.380
who actually reads W."

09:08.414 --> 09:11.018
But Harmony...
Oh, she follows me
around.

09:11.051 --> 09:14.788
If that girl had an original
thought, her head would explode.

09:14.822 --> 09:17.924
Mmm.
(chuckles)
Uh, is that Gucci?

09:17.957 --> 09:20.393
Um... no.

09:20.427 --> 09:22.629
It's an actual old thing,
sort of, um,

09:22.663 --> 09:25.231
a good luck charm
my dad gave me.

09:25.264 --> 09:27.567
Too bad I didn't have one
of those pre-Xander.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.969
(both chuckle)

09:29.001 --> 09:31.804
Can I just say... men.

09:31.838 --> 09:33.240
Seconded.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.908
Apart from being
without class,

09:34.942 --> 09:36.576
the guy's
obviously blind.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.311
Deserves whatever
he gets.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.980
I'm not even
thinking about
him.

09:40.013 --> 09:43.582
I am past it.
I am living my life.

09:43.616 --> 09:46.919
Still, I mean,
don't you kind of wish...

09:46.953 --> 09:48.755
I don't wish. I act.

09:48.788 --> 09:51.158
Starting now, Xander
Harris is gonna
get

09:51.191 --> 09:53.393
a bellyful of just how over him
I am.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.229
* I'm tired of being alone
she says *

09:56.263 --> 09:58.999
(chuckles)
* As she walks away
from my number *

09:59.032 --> 10:02.635
(forced laughter)
* Tired of being alone
as I walk *

10:02.669 --> 10:05.105
(laughter)
* In her home

10:05.138 --> 10:09.643
(forced laughter)
* You said you'd never be
with someone you love *

10:09.677 --> 10:11.644
Excuse me.

10:11.678 --> 10:13.647
I need to be both giving
and receiving of mirth.

10:13.681 --> 10:16.015
Is it too much to ask
for a little backup?

10:16.048 --> 10:18.018
I'm here for you, Xand.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.653
I'm
Support-O-Gal.

10:19.687 --> 10:22.088
I just...
feel a little weird

10:22.121 --> 10:24.692
about this
us-against-Cordelia
thing.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.693
She's had a rough time.

10:26.726 --> 10:28.528
(chuckles

10:28.561 --> 10:32.532
It's true. Cordelia belongs
to the justified camp.

10:32.565 --> 10:34.533
She should
make us pay.

10:34.567 --> 10:36.803
And pay and pay
and pay.

10:36.836 --> 10:40.039
In fact, there's just not
enough pay for what...
Look,

10:40.072 --> 10:42.042
you want to do
Guilt-apalooza,
fine,

10:42.075 --> 10:45.044
but I'm done with that.
Starting this minute,

10:45.077 --> 10:48.280
I'm gonna grab ahold of that
crazy little thing called
life

10:48.315 --> 10:50.216
and let it do its magical
little heal-y thing.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.451
What's
done
is done.

10:52.485 --> 10:56.456
Let's be in the moment.
Behold the beauty that is
now.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.191
Who's with me?

10:58.225 --> 11:01.193
Actually making sense.

11:01.227 --> 11:03.897
We're young and free
in America.

11:03.931 --> 11:07.234
How dare we be spun by love
or the lack of same?

11:07.267 --> 11:10.236
Absolutely.
I-It's self-indulgent.

11:10.269 --> 11:14.573
I'm in. I'm on the joy train.

11:14.606 --> 11:17.009
* On some Sunday
in some subtle way *

11:17.043 --> 11:20.413
* You try and you try
and you go insane *

11:20.447 --> 11:23.049
That didn't work.
Who wants chocolate?

11:23.082 --> 11:24.551
I'm up.

11:24.583 --> 11:26.552
* As she walks away
from my number *

11:26.586 --> 11:28.855
Look at her.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.658
Tears
of a clown, baby.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.661
Or is it... grins
of a sad person?

11:34.693 --> 11:36.663
Or maybe it's...
Xander, your hand.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.065
Oh. S-Sorry.

11:38.097 --> 11:39.499
But why oops?

11:39.532 --> 11:41.500
I mean, we always touch digits.

11:41.533 --> 11:42.735
It's a friend thing.

11:42.769 --> 11:45.504
Comfort, like chocolate.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.908
Maybe it used to be,
but since we...

11:48.942 --> 11:50.610
It's different.

11:50.643 --> 11:53.947
I'm sorry.

11:53.980 --> 11:56.383
But if I want to make things
right with Oz,

11:56.415 --> 11:58.384
my hands, my...

11:58.418 --> 12:03.456
all my stuff has to be
for him only.

12:03.490 --> 12:07.059
* She's tired
of being alone... *

12:07.094 --> 12:09.129
* Walkin' her home

12:09.162 --> 12:11.630
* She's tired of being alone.

12:11.663 --> 12:14.067
*

12:17.504 --> 12:19.907
(speaking indistinctly)

12:34.254 --> 12:36.956
Hey, Cordelia,
wait a second.

12:38.191 --> 12:41.161
Did Xander send you
to beg for him?

12:41.193 --> 12:42.595
Because if he did...

12:42.629 --> 12:45.597
No. I'm a free agent, I promise.

12:45.631 --> 12:48.600
I just wanted
to see how you are.

12:48.634 --> 12:51.171
Never been
better.

12:51.203 --> 12:53.505
Cordelia, I know what it's like
to be hurt by someone.

12:53.539 --> 12:56.976
Hurt so much that you don't
think you're gonna make it.

12:57.009 --> 12:59.980
But I told my friends
how I felt. And you know
what?

13:00.013 --> 13:02.816
It got a little better.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.317
(growl)
(gasp)

13:05.717 --> 13:09.322
(grunting)

13:14.027 --> 13:14.827
Cordelia, look...

13:14.861 --> 13:15.995
(shouts)

13:16.028 --> 13:16.996
...out.

13:17.029 --> 13:18.597
(growls)

13:18.630 --> 13:20.732
(grunting)

13:40.753 --> 13:43.155
(laughter)

13:49.729 --> 13:54.466
You know what I've been
asking
myself a lot this last week?

13:54.500 --> 13:57.537
Why me? Why do I get impaled?

13:57.570 --> 14:00.072
Why do I get bitten by
snakes?

14:00.106 --> 14:02.509
Why do I fall for
incredible losers?

14:02.542 --> 14:06.046
And, you know, I think
I've finally figured it out,

14:06.078 --> 14:08.414
what my problem is. It's...

14:08.447 --> 14:10.850
Buffy Summers. That's when
all my troubles started.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.684
When she moved here.

14:12.719 --> 14:14.254
You okay?

14:14.287 --> 14:16.355
Oh, I just pulled
some stitches last night.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.557
Know why? Surprise.

14:18.591 --> 14:21.561
It was Buffy's fault.
HARMONY: Oh, hey,
it's Garbage Girl.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.529
Loved the look last night,
Cor.

14:23.562 --> 14:25.999
Dumpster chic
for the dumped.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.335
(chuckles)
Yeah.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.004
(chuckling)
Oh, God.

14:31.038 --> 14:33.273
Here.

14:33.306 --> 14:36.243
I think you need this
more than I do right now.

14:36.275 --> 14:40.179
Yeah, I could use some luck.

14:40.212 --> 14:43.082
And a stick with
pointy, sharp
bits.

14:43.115 --> 14:45.085
If that Buffy wasn't...
I swear...

14:45.118 --> 14:46.919
She's a pain.

14:46.953 --> 14:51.790
But Xander, he's
an... utter loser.

14:51.823 --> 14:53.625
Don't you wish...
I never would've

14:53.659 --> 14:55.861
looked twice at Xander
if Buffy hadn't made him

14:55.894 --> 14:58.130
marginally cooler
by hanging with him.

14:58.164 --> 15:00.466
Really?
Yeah, I swear.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.769
I wish Buffy Summers
had never come to Sunnydale.

15:05.504 --> 15:06.605
(gasps)

15:06.639 --> 15:08.307
Done.

15:17.850 --> 15:20.653
(crows cawing)

15:20.687 --> 15:22.188
Anya?

15:29.196 --> 15:33.865
I wish Buffy Summers
had never come to Sunnydale.

15:36.336 --> 15:39.639
She was like... a good fairy.

15:39.672 --> 15:42.841
A scary, veiny...

15:42.875 --> 15:45.111
good fairy.

15:45.144 --> 15:47.547
(snickers)

15:49.682 --> 15:52.052
(indistinct chatter)

15:59.892 --> 16:01.528
(speaking indistinctly)

16:01.561 --> 16:02.794
Where have

16:02.828 --> 16:05.865
you been? Ted Chervin
just totally went

16:05.898 --> 16:08.301
for third with Ginger
in front of everybody.

16:08.335 --> 16:12.938
(chuckles)
Love the dress.
It's so daring.

16:12.971 --> 16:14.474
(chuckles)
JOHN:
Cordelia.

16:14.506 --> 16:16.143
Yeah?

16:16.176 --> 16:20.547
Look, every guy on campus
has probably asked, but...

16:20.580 --> 16:22.381
if you're not going to
the Winter Brunch with
anyone,

16:22.414 --> 16:25.351
I'd be honored.
And we'd have
fun.

16:25.384 --> 16:28.520
I'll get back to you.

16:28.554 --> 16:30.456
Really?
Yeah.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.326
Great
(chuckles)

16:34.726 --> 16:37.629
Cordy, you reign.

16:37.663 --> 16:40.533
I do? I mean, I
do.

16:40.567 --> 16:44.504
So what's with the
Winter Brunch thing?

16:44.537 --> 16:47.206
(school bell rings)
(panting)
All right, now,

16:47.240 --> 16:49.841
don't forget.
Tomorrow we have our, uh,

16:49.875 --> 16:51.744
monthly memorial,
so, uh,

16:51.778 --> 16:53.011
there's no class.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.915
CORDELIA:
What's the rush?

16:56.948 --> 16:59.086
Oh, you know, my mom
hates it when I'm
late.

16:59.119 --> 17:02.855
Since when? Aren't
we going out tonight?

17:02.889 --> 17:05.092
GIRL:
Curfew starts
in an hour.

17:05.125 --> 17:07.925
Curfew? Come on,
I'm in a really good mood.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.229
Let's go to The Bronze.

17:10.262 --> 17:12.765
Is that a joke?

17:12.798 --> 17:15.768
Oh! The Bronze isn't cool
in this reality.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.903
I've got to make
these little adjustments.

17:19.105 --> 17:22.241
Cordy, what's with you?

17:22.275 --> 17:25.412
I mean, you wear
this come-bite-me outfit,

17:25.444 --> 17:27.747
you make jokes about the Bronze,

17:27.779 --> 17:29.182
and you're acting
a little schizo.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.183
You're right. I just...

17:31.218 --> 17:33.586
Well, I bumped my head
yesterday,

17:33.619 --> 17:36.088
and I keep forgetting stuff.

17:36.123 --> 17:37.923
Not that I care,

17:37.957 --> 17:39.858
but Xander
Harris,
he's miserable, right?

17:39.892 --> 17:42.128
And that Willow freak
he hangs with, not
even

17:42.162 --> 17:44.596
a blip on the radar screen,
right?

17:44.631 --> 17:46.432
Well, yeah.

17:46.465 --> 17:47.799
They're dead.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.570
(scoffs)

17:55.942 --> 17:58.310
(crows cawing)

18:03.950 --> 18:07.220
Okay. Not funny.

18:07.253 --> 18:10.623
Hey, you.
Where did you put my car?

18:10.656 --> 18:13.292
Pardon?
My auto.

18:13.326 --> 18:15.795
El convertablo?

18:15.827 --> 18:18.631
You students aren't
allowed
to drive, and you know it.

18:18.664 --> 18:20.333
What?!
Go on now, miss.

18:20.366 --> 18:22.669
You better get in
before the sun sets.

18:22.701 --> 18:25.104
(crows cawing)

18:32.878 --> 18:35.281
(insects
trilling)

18:39.286 --> 18:41.688
(gate creaks)

18:44.223 --> 18:46.659
(dog barking in distance)
(siren wailing)

18:50.297 --> 18:54.267
(glass shatters in distance)

18:54.300 --> 18:56.603
(woman screams)

18:56.635 --> 18:58.871
(gasps)
Well,

18:58.904 --> 19:00.307
what do you know?

19:00.339 --> 19:02.474
Cordelia Chase.

19:02.509 --> 19:05.144
What is this,
some kind of sick joke?

19:05.178 --> 19:07.113
Harmony told me you were
dead.

19:07.145 --> 19:09.449
Now, why would
she say something like that?

19:09.481 --> 19:13.019
Let's think.

19:13.051 --> 19:15.288
Listen to me.
We have to find Buffy.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.123
She'll figure out
a way to save us.

19:17.155 --> 19:18.857
She was supposed to be here.

19:18.891 --> 19:21.294
And as much
as it kills me to admit it,

19:21.327 --> 19:23.829
things were
better
when she was around.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.664
Buffy?

19:25.698 --> 19:27.634
The slayer?
No

19:27.666 --> 19:29.236
Buffy the dog-faced girl.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.837
Duh. Who do you think
I'm talking
about?

19:31.871 --> 19:33.440
WILLOW:
Bored now.

19:37.509 --> 19:40.480
This is the part
that's less fun.

19:40.512 --> 19:43.250
When there isn't any
screaming.

19:44.683 --> 19:47.153
What's up with you two
and the leather?

19:47.185 --> 19:49.556
Play now?

19:49.588 --> 19:52.991
It's not that I don't appreciate
your appetite, Will,

19:53.025 --> 19:55.060
but I thought we agreed
it was my turn.

19:55.094 --> 19:57.497
(whimpers)
No.
No.

19:57.529 --> 19:58.998
No way!

19:59.030 --> 20:01.000
I wish us into Bizarro Land,

20:01.032 --> 20:03.435
and you guys
are still together?!

20:05.037 --> 20:07.173
I cannot win!

20:07.205 --> 20:10.076
Probably not.

20:10.108 --> 20:12.679
But I'll give you
a head start.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.448
(gasps, shouts)

20:15.481 --> 20:18.150
I love this part.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.993
You love all the parts.

20:32.499 --> 20:33.599
(growls)

20:33.633 --> 20:35.233
(gasps)

20:35.268 --> 20:37.936
(grunts)

20:37.970 --> 20:40.940
No fun. She didn't
even hardly fight.

20:40.972 --> 20:42.875
(tires
screeching)

20:42.909 --> 20:45.877
Aw, swell.
It's the White Hats.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.780
(tires screech)

20:50.115 --> 20:51.718
(snarls)

20:51.750 --> 20:52.884
I've got them.
Get the girl.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.487
(snarls)

20:57.523 --> 21:00.125
(snarling)

21:04.431 --> 21:05.998
(tires
screeching)

21:08.267 --> 21:10.269
OZ:
How's she doing?

21:10.303 --> 21:11.604
Her pulse
is strong.

21:11.637 --> 21:13.605
What was she
doing
wearing that?

21:13.640 --> 21:15.442
Everyone knows
that vampires are attracted

21:15.474 --> 21:17.676
to bright colors.
That's Cordelia.

21:17.710 --> 21:20.179
It's better to look good
than to feel
alive.

21:20.211 --> 21:22.615
Uh, go and, um,
watch the perimeter

21:22.648 --> 21:24.651
just in case they follow.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.689
(techno music playing)

21:35.126 --> 21:37.497
(grunting)

21:44.302 --> 21:46.705
(indistinct chatter)

21:51.711 --> 21:53.680
Ooh.

21:53.712 --> 21:56.516
(indistinct shouting)

21:56.548 --> 21:59.786
MAN:
Please! Oh, my God!

21:59.818 --> 22:01.953
VAMPIRE:
You'll be mine pretty soon, boy.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.356
(snickering)
(woman screaming)

22:04.391 --> 22:06.358
(glass shatters)

22:06.393 --> 22:08.961
Slap my hand, dead soul man.

22:08.994 --> 22:12.064
(chuckles)

22:12.097 --> 22:15.166
(screaming in distance)

22:17.336 --> 22:19.137
Ah.

22:19.171 --> 22:22.474
Xander.
Willow.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.876
Hungry?
(pants)

22:24.911 --> 22:27.012
I've lost my appetite
for this one.

22:27.046 --> 22:29.648
She keeps looking
at me.

22:29.682 --> 22:33.385
I'm trying to eat,
and she looks at me.

22:33.420 --> 22:34.252
Go on.

22:38.089 --> 22:38.657
(gasps

22:38.691 --> 22:40.226
(grunts)

22:40.259 --> 22:43.229
(gasping)

22:43.261 --> 22:45.664
I remember
that lust

22:45.698 --> 22:48.334
for the kill.

22:48.366 --> 22:50.670
Now,

22:50.702 --> 22:53.105
what news on the rialto?

22:53.138 --> 22:54.840
Had a prime kill.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.375
Old crush,
actually.

22:57.410 --> 23:00.078
Till that wanna-slay
librarian
showed up.

23:00.112 --> 23:02.682
He'll be dealt with soon enough.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.016
Weird thing.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.419
Girl kept talking about
Buffy.

23:06.452 --> 23:09.020
"Got to get Buffy here."

23:09.055 --> 23:11.190
Isn't that what
they called the slayer?

23:11.222 --> 23:13.092
Mmm. Buffy.

23:13.125 --> 23:15.361
Ooh. Scary.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.864
Someone has to
talk
to her people.

23:17.896 --> 23:21.133
That name is striking
fear in nobody's hearts.

23:21.166 --> 23:23.435
She talked of summoning
a slayer here,

23:23.470 --> 23:25.971
now,
at this time,

23:26.005 --> 23:27.539
and you didn't kill her?

23:27.574 --> 23:29.141
Well, they had crosses.

23:29.174 --> 23:33.480
The plant begins operation
in less than 24 hours.

23:33.512 --> 23:35.682
You will find this girl.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.951
You
will kill her

23:38.984 --> 23:41.220
before she contacts
the slayer.

23:41.252 --> 23:46.092
Or I'll see you two
kissing daylight.

23:47.125 --> 23:49.496
(groans)

23:51.663 --> 23:53.298
Hey. Hey...

23:53.332 --> 23:55.134
Giles! It's all my fault!

23:55.166 --> 23:57.302
I wasn't... I made
this stupid wish, and...
Please...

23:57.336 --> 23:58.637
Come on. Please lie...
No!

23:58.671 --> 24:00.138
You have to get Buffy.

24:00.172 --> 24:02.575
Buffy changes it.
It wasn't like this.

24:02.608 --> 24:05.243
It was better. I mean,
the clothes alone.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.480
But people were happy.

24:07.513 --> 24:10.415
Mostly. And...

24:10.449 --> 24:12.585
Wait.

24:12.618 --> 24:15.922
Why are you here
and she's not?

24:15.954 --> 24:18.156
I mean,
you-you
were her watcher.

24:18.190 --> 24:20.593
How-How do you know
I was a watcher?

24:20.626 --> 24:23.762
I've never...
(footsteps)

24:23.796 --> 24:26.432
What?

24:26.464 --> 24:28.000
What?

24:28.034 --> 24:29.868
I thought I heard
something.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.840
Now, I want you to start
again

24:34.874 --> 24:37.509
and explain everything
very carefully.

24:37.544 --> 24:40.346
You're in a big cage.

24:40.378 --> 24:42.448
(Cordelia whimpering)
XANDER
Not too
bright,

24:42.480 --> 24:43.816
book guy.

24:47.219 --> 24:48.453
(snarls)

24:48.487 --> 24:50.890
So you're a watcher, huh?

24:53.992 --> 24:55.894
Watch this.

24:57.429 --> 24:59.832
(moaning)

25:06.337 --> 25:08.708
*

25:23.454 --> 25:25.857
(panting)

25:32.463 --> 25:34.800
(grunting)

25:39.939 --> 25:43.075
(panting)
They hit us right outside.

25:43.108 --> 25:44.611
Nancy?

25:44.644 --> 25:46.244
She's dead.

25:47.278 --> 25:49.248
Um...

25:49.280 --> 25:51.683
would you mind...

25:51.718 --> 25:52.919
Could you take
her
to the incinerator?

25:52.951 --> 25:55.386
I have
some business to...

26:02.961 --> 26:05.131
(grunting)

26:07.432 --> 26:09.801
Wait a moment.

26:15.473 --> 26:17.844
(whirring)

26:27.854 --> 26:30.122
The deed is done.

26:30.155 --> 26:32.423
You killed the girl
who sought the slayer?

26:32.458 --> 26:33.759
It was too easy.

26:33.792 --> 26:35.560
I felt cheap.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.395
Excellent.

26:37.429 --> 26:40.499
The opening will commence
as scheduled.

26:40.531 --> 26:43.568
So... you're pleased?

26:43.602 --> 26:44.903
Ecstatic.

26:44.936 --> 26:46.505
Then..

26:46.538 --> 26:48.907
can I play with the puppy?

26:48.941 --> 26:52.979
Be my guest.

26:58.349 --> 27:02.587
Yes, I understand, but
it's imperative that I see her.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.256
Here.

27:04.289 --> 27:07.826
(sighs)
Well, when will you?

27:07.859 --> 27:09.595
Yeah, well, you are her watcher.

27:09.627 --> 27:12.431
I'd expect her to at least
check in to...

27:12.463 --> 27:14.333
Yes, I'm aware
that there's a great deal

27:14.365 --> 27:17.269
of demonic activity
in Cleveland.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.605
It... W-Well, it happens,
you know,

27:19.637 --> 27:22.208
that-that Sunnydale
is on a
hellmouth.

27:22.240 --> 27:24.977
It-it is so.

27:25.010 --> 27:27.645
Well, just...

27:27.680 --> 27:29.048
just give her the message

27:29.080 --> 27:31.182
if you ever see her again.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.554
(birds chirping)

27:44.096 --> 27:46.531
WILLOW:
Bored now.

27:49.667 --> 27:52.637
Daytime's the worst.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.473
Cooped up for hours.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.876
Can't hunt.

28:05.284 --> 28:08.119
But the Master said
I could play.

28:10.923 --> 28:13.692
Isn't that fun, Puppy?

28:15.693 --> 28:17.163
(creaking)

28:17.195 --> 28:19.164
Aw.

28:19.198 --> 28:22.000
Puppy's being all quiet.

28:22.034 --> 28:25.570
Come on. Don't be a spoilsport.

28:25.604 --> 28:27.973
(groans)

28:29.875 --> 28:33.179
Guess what today is.

28:33.211 --> 28:36.949
Today the plant opens.

28:36.982 --> 28:38.917
It's a big party.

28:38.951 --> 28:41.519
(groans)

28:41.552 --> 28:45.624
You remember I
told
you about the plant?

28:45.656 --> 28:49.228
All those people
you tried to
save?

28:49.260 --> 28:51.798
It's gonna be quick for them.

28:51.830 --> 28:53.833
Not for you, though.

28:55.233 --> 28:58.304
It's gonna be slow for you.

28:59.838 --> 29:02.473
That's right, puppy.

29:02.508 --> 29:05.243
Willow's gonna make you bark.

29:05.277 --> 29:06.778
Aah!

29:06.813 --> 29:08.713
Oh...

29:08.747 --> 29:11.784
Maybe I went too hard
on you last time.

29:17.123 --> 29:19.826
(moaning)

29:19.858 --> 29:21.292
Too hard?

29:21.326 --> 29:23.328
No such thing.

29:23.362 --> 29:26.397
Watch it with those things.
You almost got my hair.

29:26.432 --> 29:27.499
Sorry.

29:27.532 --> 29:29.268
Got carried away.

29:30.501 --> 29:32.137
Don't you want
to?

29:32.171 --> 29:35.307
No, thanks, baby.

29:35.340 --> 29:36.875
I just want
to watch you go.

29:41.146 --> 29:42.780
(Angel screams)

29:42.815 --> 29:44.951
Here it is!

29:44.983 --> 29:47.318
I found it.

29:47.353 --> 29:49.488
Look.

29:49.520 --> 29:51.757
It's what, um,
Cordelia was wearing.

29:51.789 --> 29:53.325
It's the-the, uh,

29:53.358 --> 29:56.494
symbol of-of Anyanka.

29:56.528 --> 29:58.529
I don't think I know her.

29:58.564 --> 30:01.133
Well, no.
Um, um,
Anyanka

30:01.166 --> 30:02.534
is, uh, sort of a patron

30:02.567 --> 30:05.171
saint of scorned
women.

30:05.203 --> 30:06.704
What does she do?

30:07.906 --> 30:10.209
Uh, she grants wishes.

30:10.241 --> 30:11.643
So Cordelia
wished
for something?

30:11.676 --> 30:13.179
Well, if it was
a long, healthy life,

30:13.211 --> 30:14.881
she should get her money
back.

30:14.913 --> 30:17.648
She said something about
everything being different,

30:17.682 --> 30:21.519
that the... the world wasn't
supposed to be like this.

30:21.553 --> 30:24.355
It was, um, better.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.192
Before.

30:26.224 --> 30:28.193
Okay,
the entire world sucks,

30:28.227 --> 30:30.061
because some dead ditz
made a wish?

30:32.397 --> 30:34.066
I just, I just
want to be clear.

30:34.099 --> 30:36.167
She said the,
uh...

30:36.201 --> 30:38.971
the slayer was supposed
to be here,

30:39.005 --> 30:42.307
that was, um, meant
to have been here already.

30:42.340 --> 30:44.675
Certainly would've helped.

30:44.710 --> 30:46.744
Yes. I tried calling her,
but, um...

30:46.778 --> 30:49.580
Look, I'm, I'm,
I'm gonna have to...

30:49.615 --> 30:52.151
research this Anyanka
thing further.

30:52.183 --> 30:54.987
Um, I have some more...

30:55.020 --> 30:57.155
volumes at-at home.

30:57.189 --> 30:58.891
You
two-two
get some
sleep.

30:58.924 --> 31:00.558
Watch your back.

31:01.759 --> 31:04.695
(quiet laugh)

31:09.935 --> 31:12.871
(woman screaming)

31:21.380 --> 31:23.382
Get up there!
(clamoring)

31:28.153 --> 31:29.255
Hey!

31:31.757 --> 31:33.125
Run!

31:33.159 --> 31:35.161
(screaming, clamoring)

31:41.400 --> 31:42.701
WOMAN:
(screams)
Come on!

31:42.733 --> 31:44.470
(vampire shouts)

31:45.971 --> 31:48.941
(vampires grunting)

31:59.151 --> 32:00.987
Buffy Summers?

32:01.019 --> 32:02.288
That's right.

32:04.123 --> 32:06.924
Want to tell me
what I'm doing here?

32:18.003 --> 32:20.439
Ah! Ah!
Ah!

32:20.471 --> 32:22.307
Yes!

32:22.340 --> 32:24.609
Here-- "In order
to defeat Anyanka,

32:24.643 --> 32:27.445
"one must destroy
her power center.

32:27.479 --> 32:29.280
"this should reverse all
the wishes she's granted,

32:29.315 --> 32:30.582
rendering her mortal
and powerless again."

32:30.615 --> 32:31.616
You see?

32:31.650 --> 32:33.618
Without her power center,

32:33.652 --> 32:35.653
she'd just be, uh, an
ordinary woman again.

32:35.686 --> 32:37.655
And all this would be, um...

32:37.689 --> 32:40.592
Well, different.

32:40.625 --> 32:43.628
Well, I'd say that
my watcher muscles

32:43.662 --> 32:47.133
haven't completely
atrophied after all.

32:47.165 --> 32:49.000
Great.

32:49.035 --> 32:50.701
What's her power center?

32:50.736 --> 32:53.172
Um, well, uh,
um...

32:54.740 --> 32:56.942
It doesn't
say.

32:56.974 --> 32:59.345
Why don't I just put
a stake through her heart?

32:59.377 --> 33:01.646
She's not a vampire.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.848
Yeah, well, you'd be
surprised
how many things that'll kill.

33:03.882 --> 33:05.651
I don't want to kill
her, Miss Summers.

33:05.683 --> 33:08.653
I want to reverse
whatever effect

33:08.686 --> 33:10.821
she's had on this-this world.

33:10.855 --> 33:13.392
(sighs)

33:13.424 --> 33:15.493
You're taking an awful lot
on faith here, Jeeves.

33:15.527 --> 33:16.894
Giles.

33:17.895 --> 33:19.897
Kill the bad fairy.

33:19.931 --> 33:21.866
Destroy the bad fairy's
power center, whatever,

33:21.900 --> 33:24.202
and all the troubles
go away?

33:24.236 --> 33:25.804
Yeah, well, I'm sure
it's not that simple, but--

33:25.836 --> 33:27.338
World is what it is.

33:27.373 --> 33:29.674
We fight.
We die.

33:29.708 --> 33:31.876
Wishing doesn't change that.

33:31.910 --> 33:33.744
I have to believe
in a better
world.

33:33.778 --> 33:35.346
Go ahead.

33:35.381 --> 33:38.049
I have to live in this one.

33:38.084 --> 33:39.518
Uh, Cordelia said

33:39.550 --> 33:42.554
she knew that I was
meant to be your watcher.

33:42.587 --> 33:43.922
She said she knew you.

33:43.954 --> 33:46.825
She's probably just a big
fan.

33:46.857 --> 33:49.528
The Master sent
his most vicious disciples

33:49.560 --> 33:53.065
to kill her-- now, she must
have posed some threat to him.

33:53.098 --> 33:54.599
Master?

33:54.633 --> 33:56.934
Um, supreme vampire
around these parts.

33:56.968 --> 34:00.105
He-he lives on the outskirts
of town in an old club.

34:00.138 --> 34:01.873
You know where he lives,

34:01.906 --> 34:04.076
and no one's ever tried
to take him out?

34:04.109 --> 34:05.777
People have
tried.

34:06.778 --> 34:08.614
Well, point the way.

34:08.646 --> 34:10.882
I might as well do some good
while I'm in this town.

34:10.916 --> 34:11.949
You can't just walk
in there and--

34:11.983 --> 34:13.219
Look, you want to stay here

34:13.251 --> 34:14.753
and play make-believe, fine.

34:14.786 --> 34:16.222
I'm not gonna be any help
to you anyway.

34:16.255 --> 34:18.289
There's only one thing
I'm good at.

34:18.324 --> 34:20.592
At least let's muster
some kind of force.

34:20.626 --> 34:23.195
I don't play well with
others.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.795
Now, I'm gonna
ask you this
once,

34:24.829 --> 34:25.931
and then I'm gonna get testy.

34:25.963 --> 34:28.934
(drops book)

34:28.967 --> 34:31.936
Where is this club?

35:08.373 --> 35:10.509
Buffy.

35:10.541 --> 35:12.978
Buffy Summers.

35:19.016 --> 35:21.652
It's you.

35:21.686 --> 35:24.822
I mean... you don't remember.

35:24.856 --> 35:26.458
How could you?

35:26.492 --> 35:28.327
How did you know my name?

35:28.360 --> 35:31.996
I waited.

35:32.030 --> 35:34.532
I waited here for you.

35:34.565 --> 35:35.967
But you never--

35:36.001 --> 35:37.969
I was supposed to help you.

35:38.003 --> 35:40.038
(scoffs)

35:40.070 --> 35:41.806
You were gonna help me?

35:42.974 --> 35:44.710
The Master rose.

35:44.742 --> 35:46.211
He let me live.

35:46.244 --> 35:49.114
To punish me.

35:49.146 --> 35:52.884
I kept hoping
maybe you'd come.

35:55.085 --> 35:57.956
My destiny.

35:57.989 --> 35:59.123
(chuckles)

35:59.157 --> 36:01.025
Is this a get-in-my-pants thing?

36:01.059 --> 36:03.228
You guys in Sunnydale talk
like I'm the second coming.

36:03.262 --> 36:04.862
I'm sorry.

36:04.896 --> 36:06.297
I just meant--

36:06.331 --> 36:08.400
Look, I don't have
time for stories.

36:08.434 --> 36:10.536
Where's the Master?

36:10.568 --> 36:13.304
They're at his factory.

36:13.338 --> 36:15.340
It starts
tonight.

36:15.373 --> 36:17.074
"Factory"?

36:17.108 --> 36:19.777
Look, I-I...
I can take you there.

36:37.396 --> 36:39.197
(gasps)

36:39.231 --> 36:41.099
Oh, you got
to be kidding me!

36:41.132 --> 36:43.101
Wait, I won't hurt
you.

36:43.134 --> 36:45.202
No, you'll leave that
to your Master.

36:45.237 --> 36:47.639
You don't believe
I want to help
you?

36:53.945 --> 36:57.047
Believe I want him dead.

37:01.987 --> 37:05.556
MASTER:
And now behold
the technical wonder

37:05.590 --> 37:09.027
which is about to alter
the very fabric of our society.

37:09.059 --> 37:10.528
Some have argued

37:10.561 --> 37:13.097
that such an advancement
goes against our nature.

37:13.130 --> 37:15.199
They claim
that death is our art.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.768
I say to them--

37:17.802 --> 37:20.806
Well, I don't say anything
to them because I kill them.

37:20.838 --> 37:24.108
Undeniably, we are
the world's superior race.

37:24.141 --> 37:26.811
Yet we have always been
too parochial,

37:26.844 --> 37:29.047
too bound by the mindless

37:29.079 --> 37:31.048
routine of the predator.

37:31.081 --> 37:34.552
Hunt and kill, hunt and kill.
Titillating?

37:34.585 --> 37:35.887
Yes.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.590
Practical?
Hardly.

37:38.623 --> 37:42.293
Meanwhile, the humans,
with their plebeian minds,

37:42.327 --> 37:45.931
have brought us
a truly demonic concept--

37:45.963 --> 37:47.932
Mass production!

37:47.965 --> 37:50.436
(vampires cheering)

37:51.802 --> 37:55.873
We really are living
in a golden age.

38:02.981 --> 38:05.784
Oh... Anyanka,

38:05.817 --> 38:07.853
I-I beseech thee...

38:07.885 --> 38:10.288
Um...

38:12.458 --> 38:16.362
In the name
of all women scorned...

38:16.394 --> 38:18.463
come before me.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.135
Oh!
(chuckles)

38:24.168 --> 38:25.971
Do you have any idea

38:26.003 --> 38:27.806
what I do to a
man

38:27.838 --> 38:30.742
who uses that spell
to summon me?

38:34.079 --> 38:35.447
Bring on the first!

38:35.481 --> 38:36.614
Get back!

38:36.648 --> 38:38.516
Open it up!

38:38.550 --> 38:40.284
You!

38:40.318 --> 38:41.452
(all clamoring)

38:41.487 --> 38:42.621
(woman screams)

38:42.653 --> 38:44.289
No!

38:44.322 --> 38:46.056
Please! No!
Help me!

38:46.090 --> 38:47.992
No!
(screams)

38:48.025 --> 38:49.460
No

38:49.494 --> 38:51.862
No! Oh!
(electrical shocks)

39:01.672 --> 39:03.641
She's still alive, you see,

39:03.675 --> 39:06.210
for the
freshness.

39:41.311 --> 39:44.081
What's the plan?

39:44.114 --> 39:46.117
Don't fall on
this.

39:49.320 --> 39:51.222
(indistinct chatter)

40:04.570 --> 40:07.304
Welcome to the future.

40:07.338 --> 40:09.206
To the future!

40:09.239 --> 40:10.307
VAMPIRES (chanting):
The future!

40:10.340 --> 40:11.909
The future!

40:14.144 --> 40:16.782
(vampires clamoring)

40:21.586 --> 40:23.288
Uh-oh.
Puppy got out.

40:40.304 --> 40:42.807
Cordelia Chase--
What did she wish for?

40:42.840 --> 40:46.143
I had no idea her wish
would be so exciting.

40:46.177 --> 40:47.978
Brave new world.

40:48.012 --> 40:50.815
I hope she likes it.

40:58.056 --> 41:00.190
You're gonna change it back.

41:02.793 --> 41:04.795
I'm not afraid of you.

41:04.829 --> 41:07.197
Your only
power
lies in the wishing.

41:07.998 --> 41:10.467
Wrong!

41:16.474 --> 41:18.510
(grunting)

41:25.250 --> 41:27.251
ANGEL:
Buffy, look out!

41:31.690 --> 41:33.791
Buffy...

41:33.824 --> 41:35.726
ANYANKA:
 This is the real world now.

41:37.262 --> 41:39.063
This is the world we made.

41:39.097 --> 41:41.032
Isn't it
wonderful?

41:57.548 --> 41:59.951
*

42:53.137 --> 42:54.940
You trusting
fool!

42:54.972 --> 42:56.373
How do you know
the other world

42:56.407 --> 42:58.043
is any better than this?

42:58.076 --> 43:01.012
Because it has to be.

43:08.920 --> 43:09.788
No!

43:25.670 --> 43:29.139
I wish Buffy Summers
had never come to Sunnydale.

43:30.307 --> 43:31.342
Done.

43:31.376 --> 43:32.577
That would be cool.

43:32.610 --> 43:34.813
No, wait.

43:34.846 --> 43:37.983
I wish Buffy Summers
had never been born.

43:38.016 --> 43:39.117
Done!

43:39.150 --> 43:41.318
And I wish
that Xander Harris

43:41.351 --> 43:42.920
never again knows

43:42.954 --> 43:44.121
the touch of a woman.

43:44.155 --> 43:45.657
And that Willow
wakes up tomorrow

43:45.690 --> 43:47.291
covered in monkey hair.

43:47.324 --> 43:48.425
Done!

43:48.458 --> 43:50.494
In fact, I wish all men

43:50.527 --> 43:53.998
except maybe the dumb
and the really agreeable
kind,

43:54.032 --> 43:55.666
disappear off the face
of the Earth.

43:55.701 --> 43:57.936
That would be so cool!

43:57.969 --> 44:00.371
Or maybe...

44:41.045 --> 44:43.514
Grr. Argh.
