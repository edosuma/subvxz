00:29.640 --> 00:34.395
THE FOLLOWING STORY
IS BASED ON TRUE EVENTS

00:46.080 --> 00:48.799
The guy went blind.
- Correct.

00:50.480 --> 00:52.789
Next question.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.393
Which two countries share
the longest border in the whole world?

00:59.120 --> 01:02.715
The longest border shared by
the two of them, one on either side.

01:02.920 --> 01:05.434
The same length.
- One country on either side.

01:05.640 --> 01:07.073
China and Russia.

01:07.640 --> 01:09.119
Wrong.
- Canada and the USA.

01:09.320 --> 01:10.594
OK, next question.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.758
What's the most common Jewish toast?
- Toasted matzo!

01:14.320 --> 01:16.515
I don't know.
- La'chaim.

01:16.720 --> 01:19.678
La'chaim means 'to life'.

01:19.880 --> 01:23.873
Ask me a question. I know everything.
- What does DNA mean?

01:25.200 --> 01:27.509
To me?
- No, to everyone, including you.

01:27.720 --> 01:30.359
OK. Deoxyribonucleic acid.

01:30.560 --> 01:31.675
I don't believe it!

01:32.800 --> 01:35.360
We could just measure them
to see whose is longest.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.676
Measure them?
Yes, let's measure them.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.871
OK, Mario first.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.873
Could be better.

01:45.080 --> 01:46.354
That's a good one!

01:46.560 --> 01:48.755
They're there, they're there.
It's the Americans.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.354
Missiles, missiles.
Cruise missiles.

01:52.560 --> 01:53.879
The Americans are there.

01:54.120 --> 01:56.998
They're there. They're there.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.591
What's the matter?
- It's happening.

02:01.800 --> 02:05.076
What is?
- They can't get through. It's blocked.

02:05.640 --> 02:07.676
They're there.
- Attack!

02:25.640 --> 02:27.153
It's war, guys!

02:42.160 --> 02:44.549
TIME OF MY LIFE

02:50.400 --> 02:52.118
That's dangerous.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.629
Doesn't look like nuclear missiles.
- I reckon it's full of hamburgers.

03:33.240 --> 03:35.390
You up there, get the fuck down!

03:40.360 --> 03:42.999
Get your arse down from there.
- You get out of my country.

03:52.520 --> 03:54.476
Thomas, duck!

03:55.280 --> 03:58.113
Shit, Speck.
- Sorry.

04:09.880 --> 04:10.869
My hero.

04:11.080 --> 04:13.833
You're my hero too. My two heroes.

04:14.040 --> 04:17.827
A fine pacifist you are.
- Sorry, I thought you would duck.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.553
You were lucky, pal.
- Me? Absolutely.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.352
Me, I was born lucky.

04:23.240 --> 04:25.708
We have to squeeze into
that little tent again later.

04:25.920 --> 04:27.831
There's room in my tent.

04:29.880 --> 04:33.475
Where's Jean-Pierre-Christian-
FranÃ§ois-Yves-Bernard?

04:33.680 --> 04:36.399
He's gone off to learn to count.
- To 69?

04:36.600 --> 04:39.672
No, to two.
He usually only got as far as one.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.997
Exit Jean-Pierre-Yves.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.875
What do they say at the sperm bank?
- Thank you for coming.

04:46.080 --> 04:50.756
He said he wanted to stay friends
but I said I already had enough friends.

04:51.240 --> 04:54.596
You're some chick, you are.
- Life is for living!

04:56.080 --> 04:57.149
Nurse.

04:57.360 --> 04:59.954
I'm bleeding badly.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.912
Speck.
- A tourniquet.

05:02.120 --> 05:04.111
No, no, it's better now.

05:04.320 --> 05:06.788
Because I held my hand there?
The magic touch.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.116
Anyone else?
- You've done enough damage.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.156
Suppose you have to choose.
- Have to?

05:13.360 --> 05:18.559
Yes, you have to choose.
A gun is being held to your head.

05:18.760 --> 05:19.988
Choose.
- No.

05:21.760 --> 05:24.194
Choosing is losing. No.

05:24.400 --> 05:27.790
So we're just numbers 384 and 385
on the list?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.912
No, that's the point.
- What's the point?

05:32.040 --> 05:34.713
That's the point, neither of you.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.834
Or both of you,
that's an option too, of course.

05:41.760 --> 05:43.591
Both of us?
- Yes.

05:44.120 --> 05:48.432
Yeah, well, why do you think
a woman has two hands?

05:49.120 --> 05:50.348
And two legs?

05:51.600 --> 05:55.195
And two eyes. And two lips.
- One small anatomical detail,

05:55.400 --> 05:59.029
why has a woman only got one...
- Tent?

05:59.840 --> 06:01.796
Very good, doctor.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.353
Good point, doctor.

06:04.600 --> 06:07.592
Because boys have to learn to share.

06:12.960 --> 06:14.109
I'm up for it.

06:14.960 --> 06:17.235
OK, so am I.

06:22.280 --> 06:24.794
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.873
Goodnight.

06:31.120 --> 06:32.712
Goodnight.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.309
Have we finished?

06:37.280 --> 06:38.713
Go to sleep now.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.397
One. One kiss.

06:47.040 --> 06:50.112
Eh... Hello, I'm here too.

06:50.320 --> 06:51.594
Thomas?

06:51.880 --> 06:54.553
Thomas, how do you want me?

06:55.440 --> 06:56.839
Out of the tent?

06:57.560 --> 07:00.552
Silly idiots!
- Does my breath stink, or something?

07:00.760 --> 07:01.795
Someone's there.

07:06.480 --> 07:11.349
What are you lot up to?
- Trying to sleep, pal.

07:12.280 --> 07:15.556
No messing about or...
- No, boss.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.678
My air bed's deflated.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.634
What a shame!

07:26.160 --> 07:28.720
Push. Call that pushing?
- That's pushing.

07:32.240 --> 07:33.958
That's it, thanks.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.071
We're going home, guys!

07:46.680 --> 07:49.911
IN HEAVEN

07:52.880 --> 07:56.395
Baby!
- Speck!

08:03.160 --> 08:04.718
Hey, what's going on?

08:04.920 --> 08:07.388
That's mine.
- Yeah, yeah. Hi Sask.

08:07.600 --> 08:08.874
Couple of clowns.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.038
Right, shall we go?
- Yes.

08:16.720 --> 08:19.757
What an ugly git!
- The guy's a monster.

08:19.960 --> 08:22.713
Women are weapons of mass destruction.

08:23.160 --> 08:25.515
See you later.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.592
Fancy a drink?
- We could have a drink.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.119
We must have a drink.
- We will.

08:33.120 --> 08:35.554
Honestly!
- So cool. It's so cool.

08:35.760 --> 08:37.990
Miss? Angel of this heaven?

08:38.440 --> 08:43.355
I would like to order a beer
for my friend here.

08:43.559 --> 08:47.553
With gin and milk.
- You're a nice friend.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.276
Yeah, I think so too.
Shall we be friends?

08:50.560 --> 08:51.993
Haha, nice try.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.069
Here you are.

08:54.320 --> 08:57.278
Lachoom, lachim, lacham...
What was it again? La'chaim.

09:04.200 --> 09:05.235
Another one?

09:05.920 --> 09:07.478
A hand.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.833
And another hand.
Both for me?

09:11.320 --> 09:13.072
No whispering!

09:13.360 --> 09:17.433
Here's the boundary.
A conversation here. And us here.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.472
In the name of the Father

09:44.920 --> 09:48.390
and Saint Lecher.
Omen.

09:57.360 --> 09:59.828
When is it your turn?
- When you're available again.

10:00.040 --> 10:02.793
Hey, watch it, doctor.

10:03.440 --> 10:06.193
She's mine, hands off.
- Listen to him.

10:14.520 --> 10:18.115
Thomas is the godfather?
So he didn't get to choose then?

10:19.160 --> 10:21.230
Speck, stop it, pal. Come on.

10:21.840 --> 10:24.673
There you are,
a great thinker has been born.

10:24.880 --> 10:27.155
Honestly. That's not funny, Speck.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.793
All philosophers have a beard.

10:38.400 --> 10:39.355
Thank you.

10:40.160 --> 10:44.119
Well done, doctor!
Here's Doctor Love!

10:44.440 --> 10:46.670
Here he is, <i>Dr Zhivagina.</i>

10:48.520 --> 10:51.273
Can we all be your patients, doctor?
- You can.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.994
Me too, me too.
- You too, you too.

10:57.280 --> 10:58.918
A bit higher.
- Thomas.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.759
Honestly!
- Vote for Verstraete.

11:01.960 --> 11:04.155
Hey, Thomas.
- Vote for Verstraete.

11:05.280 --> 11:08.033
Stop, that's enough.
I want to be elected.

11:08.880 --> 11:10.313
Here, Milan.
- Like this.

11:10.960 --> 11:13.235
Milan, help! Help me!

11:15.680 --> 11:20.356
We need more hot chicks for the workers.
- Hot chicks for the barman.

11:20.560 --> 11:22.039
Vote for Verstraete.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.878
Vote for me.
- Vote for me.

11:24.080 --> 11:25.195
Certainly not for me.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.709
Can you sign this, please?

11:30.680 --> 11:33.478
You are now officially divorced.

11:39.200 --> 11:43.273
What does a divorced man do?
- Masturbate.

11:43.480 --> 11:47.359
Hang around in bars.
- Let's go to a bar first, then.

11:47.560 --> 11:48.834
Fine.

11:52.520 --> 11:55.717
Did you make all those shelves
yourself, doctor?

11:55.920 --> 11:57.876
Yeah, I made them all myself.

11:58.080 --> 12:02.119
And have you read all those books?
- Yes... well, I've read that one there.

12:02.320 --> 12:05.630
That book of photos?
- No, it's a colouring book.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.231
Is it a clean illness?
I only do clean illnesses.

12:09.440 --> 12:13.069
It's OK, it's my eyes.
Mainly my eyes.

12:13.360 --> 12:16.318
That's your age, pal.
Shall I prescribe you some glasses?

12:16.520 --> 12:18.750
You're a politician,
they all wear glasses.

12:20.120 --> 12:22.588
I wouldn't touch that,
because...

12:23.080 --> 12:24.672
Right, drop them...

12:25.840 --> 12:27.671
Just joking, come with me.

12:29.040 --> 12:32.555
And that one?
- R-D-O-X-L-D-E-C...

12:32.760 --> 12:36.799
Top, bottom, left, right.
I can see all that, Thomas.

12:37.040 --> 12:40.316
But I see black spots all the time.

12:41.560 --> 12:46.429
When I had a shower the other day
I saw double for quite a while.

12:48.520 --> 12:49.509
So...

12:50.080 --> 12:51.752
That's not good.

12:52.920 --> 12:56.310
'That's not good.'
Couldn't you sound a bit less ominous?

13:00.480 --> 13:04.598
I'm going to refer you to a specialist.
- At last, a real doctor.

13:05.760 --> 13:07.159
He's very good.

13:08.120 --> 13:11.999
A neurologist?
Shouldn't I see an eye specialist?

13:13.120 --> 13:14.838
If something's wrong, tell me.

13:15.120 --> 13:18.192
No, no. We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

13:18.400 --> 13:21.597
It doesn't hurt to
exclude various things.

13:21.800 --> 13:25.998
Or to entrust your brilliant,
perverse brain to science.

13:26.480 --> 13:29.438
What if they want to keep
my brilliant brain and put it a jar?

13:29.720 --> 13:31.233
It'd be a very small jar...

13:45.040 --> 13:49.477
It'd be great if you could
see him next week. Yes.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.319
Excellent.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.555
Yes.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.552
Yes, he's a friend of mine.

13:59.280 --> 14:02.238
Right. OK, thanks. Bye.

14:45.160 --> 14:46.229
Right.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.552
That bloody sucks!

14:51.120 --> 14:52.348
Yes.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.314
Condemned.

14:55.520 --> 15:00.196
I didn't do anything wrong. Nothing.
And bang, I get life.

15:01.320 --> 15:02.753
Have you made your choice?

15:02.960 --> 15:05.190
Two thirty-threes.

15:05.880 --> 15:08.314
Two <i>thirty-thlees.</i>
- That's right.

15:08.520 --> 15:10.511
And to <i>dlink? Minelal water?</i>
- Yes.

15:10.720 --> 15:14.156
Two <i>minelal waters</i> to <i>dlink.</i>
Thank you.

15:14.760 --> 15:15.954
Thank you.

15:17.200 --> 15:21.113
<i>Thirty-thlee.</i> It's incredible we're
still ordering it just to annoy the man.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.754
With <i>plawn clackers.</i>
- And <i>flied lice.</i>

15:26.640 --> 15:31.998
When I came outside I thought the world
must surely have stopped turning.

15:32.200 --> 15:37.228
I've got MS, I've got multiple
sclerosis! Everything's going to stop.

15:37.440 --> 15:43.276
But everything carries on. The buses are
still running, people are laughing.

15:43.480 --> 15:45.198
Everything is carrying on, so I must.

15:45.400 --> 15:48.312
<i>Plawn clackers</i> and <i>minelal water.</i>

15:48.520 --> 15:50.112
There you go.
- Thanks.

15:50.440 --> 15:56.037
You can learn to live with it.
- Your colleague said that too.

15:56.240 --> 15:58.754
'In some cases people
just learn to live with it.'

15:58.960 --> 16:03.431
But what about the other cases?
- OK...

16:06.000 --> 16:08.594
MS can take various forms.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.951
There are lots of examples of people
who have it under control.

16:12.160 --> 16:14.993
Yeah, right. Superman is
in a wheelchair too, isn't he?

16:15.200 --> 16:16.952
He just loves that.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.471
I'm so fuckin' angry.
So fuckin' angry!

16:30.800 --> 16:31.869
With my body.

16:32.280 --> 16:34.316
My bloody stupid body.

16:35.160 --> 16:38.038
I feel betrayed.
I feel so betrayed, Thomas.

16:43.680 --> 16:47.309
<i>Your applause please for AndrÃ© and</i>
<i>Jeanine who have been together...</i>

16:47.520 --> 16:50.830
<i>for 250 years</i>
<i>because they couldn't find anyone else.</i>

16:51.040 --> 16:52.792
<i>My condolences, Jeanine.</i>

16:55.160 --> 16:59.517
He's full of life.
- You know Mario. Doesn't give up.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.836
Can you hear it, Milan?
Can you hear it?

17:02.040 --> 17:04.838
It's a cruel illness.
He's fine again now

17:05.040 --> 17:08.156
but who knows what will happen
the next time he has an attack.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.994
I always worry
what the outcome will be.

17:11.200 --> 17:14.192
Yes, but it may stabilise.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.993
You have to learn to
live with being ill.

17:17.200 --> 17:21.397
But who wants to, eh?
- Thanks, sweetheart.

17:24.440 --> 17:27.590
Fancy a drink?
- There aren't many good-looking chicks.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.756
Aren't there?
- No.

17:31.200 --> 17:34.988
You're right. You and I'll have to
make do with each other then.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.511
D'you know what the advantage of MS is?

17:39.720 --> 17:43.190
There isn't one. Not a fuckin' thing.
Oh yes, there is.

17:43.560 --> 17:47.917
You're allowed to piss in letterboxes
if you can't wait any longer.

17:48.120 --> 17:49.189
Thank you.

17:49.400 --> 17:52.278
There are other shitty illnesses too,
you know.

17:52.480 --> 17:53.833
No, you're right.

17:54.040 --> 17:57.953
The advantage is you don't die of it.
The disadvantage is...

17:58.960 --> 18:00.712
you don't die of it.

18:03.520 --> 18:05.511
You'd have preferred otherwise,
or what?

18:05.720 --> 18:11.158
You know... you learn to stumble on.

18:12.120 --> 18:13.473
That that works too.

18:13.800 --> 18:17.679
So I'm stumbling cheerfully on,
but let me make one thing clear, Thomas,

18:17.880 --> 18:20.997
if one day I can't do it any more,
I won't carry on stumbling on.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.194
Meaning?

18:23.400 --> 18:26.278
I'm not going to die
a slow, painful death like my grandma.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.677
Let's not go on about
Dying With Dignity again.

18:29.880 --> 18:32.599
OK, it's a silly name
for a pressure group.

18:32.800 --> 18:37.749
But who can object to
dying with dignity? No one.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.991
Are you already thinking about that?

18:41.840 --> 18:43.159
No, I'm not.

18:44.480 --> 18:45.595
Not yet.

18:45.800 --> 18:47.518
One day, maybe.

18:47.720 --> 18:52.111
I need to know that
if the house is ever on fire,

18:52.320 --> 18:56.677
someone will take me to the exit.
- Typical. What do you mean by exit?

18:57.640 --> 18:59.358
You know very well what I mean.

19:00.840 --> 19:04.515
I need to know I am safe.

19:06.560 --> 19:10.473
That someone will help me,
should it ever be necessary.

19:11.520 --> 19:13.750
What does necessary mean?

19:16.040 --> 19:19.555
Will you help me?
- Don't talk like that, you're drunk.

19:20.040 --> 19:21.712
I'm not drunk.

19:21.920 --> 19:25.196
I haven't had that much too much,
but that's not the point.

19:25.400 --> 19:28.039
Will you help me,
should it ever be necessary?

19:29.960 --> 19:33.316
Yes, I'll help you.
- Perfect, that's all I need to know.

19:33.520 --> 19:36.432
I know you'll help me.
I know you will.

19:36.640 --> 19:40.838
Come on, let's go and have a drink.
I'm paying. One last drink.

19:41.040 --> 19:46.637
Or rather, the last but one.
Come on, Thomas. La'chaim!

19:47.680 --> 19:48.954
Or I'll be lachrymose.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.029
Come on, Thomas.

19:56.680 --> 19:59.672
PERSONAL COMMENT ON
THE EUTHANASIA DEBATE

19:59.880 --> 20:02.599
IF I CAN NO LONGER
LIVE WITH DIGNITY,

20:02.800 --> 20:04.711
I WANT TO DIE WITH DIGNITY

20:23.360 --> 20:27.672
So you knew about it?
- Yes. Well...

20:28.200 --> 20:31.192
Yes and no, Francine.
I mean, I knew...

20:31.400 --> 20:34.790
I knew he was a member of
the Dying With Dignity pressure group

20:35.000 --> 20:38.276
but you two knew that too, eh?
- Yes, but...

20:38.480 --> 20:42.029
But he always said it wasn't for him.

20:42.240 --> 20:47.439
MS isn't a fatal illness.
You've told us that often enough.

20:47.640 --> 20:50.552
So why is he talking about dying?
He's still OK?

20:52.440 --> 20:53.668
Yes.

20:54.400 --> 20:57.153
Yes, for someone who is ill.

21:00.920 --> 21:03.753
You will help us, won't you?
Promise me.

21:05.480 --> 21:06.469
Promise me.

21:07.480 --> 21:11.632
You have to promise us.
It's keeping Roger awake at night.

21:15.400 --> 21:18.437
Of course I'll help you, Francine.
Of course I will.

21:20.040 --> 21:21.075
Good.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.079
Good, Thomas.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.560
Hey, a visitor!
Hello, citizen.

21:48.360 --> 21:50.794
What's that?
- A piece I sent in.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.637
Why?
What was the idea?

21:54.880 --> 21:57.519
It's a fight.
Like when we were young, Thomas.

21:57.720 --> 22:00.917
That stirs things up.
- Yes, that stirs things up.

22:01.120 --> 22:04.590
A lot. Especially for your parents.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.553
I hope no one reads that
to your son. Honestly!

22:07.760 --> 22:11.230
'When the time comes, I want to leave
this life with a clear conscience.'

22:11.440 --> 22:14.750
For the umpteenth time, Mario,
you can grow as old as me.

22:15.040 --> 22:16.632
Or older.
- Read what it says.

22:16.840 --> 22:21.231
'When the time comes.'
- And we have to sit and wait with you?

22:21.440 --> 22:26.468
'The doctors who've promised to help me
aren't murderers who should be punished

22:26.680 --> 22:29.399
but people who will commit
a humanitarian act.'

22:29.600 --> 22:31.352
I hope you don't mean me.

22:31.560 --> 22:34.996
If you'll excuse me, I've got other
humanitarian acts to carry out.

22:37.880 --> 22:40.235
And call your mother.
- My mother? Thomas!

22:40.520 --> 22:41.555
What?

22:44.040 --> 22:44.995
Wait a minute.

22:46.800 --> 22:47.835
Calm down.

22:49.040 --> 22:50.792
Fancy a Chinese?

22:53.560 --> 22:55.915
There you are.
What would you like to <i>dlink?</i>

22:56.120 --> 22:59.396
<i>Minelal water.</i>
<i>- Minelal water.</i> OK.

23:00.040 --> 23:03.237
He's great. I reckon
he only does it to oblige us.

23:04.920 --> 23:06.990
Yeah.
But seriously...

23:07.200 --> 23:10.636
Why do you keep on about dying? Why?

23:10.840 --> 23:13.400
I don't understand
why no one talks about it.

23:13.600 --> 23:18.549
All those people at their parents'
bedside, as they die of rampant cancer,

23:18.760 --> 23:20.990
only talk about the weather, about food.

23:21.200 --> 23:25.034
'It's nice here, the staff are friendly
and blah blah blah.'

23:25.240 --> 23:29.836
And that's the solution? Frightening
your parents by talking about dying?

23:32.800 --> 23:34.756
I've got it.
- Shit.

23:34.960 --> 23:36.234
It's OK.
- Sorry.

23:37.080 --> 23:42.837
I can see half of everything
perfectly, Thomas.

23:43.360 --> 23:47.353
Half of the world about me, half of
this table, half of your ugly face.

23:47.800 --> 23:51.839
Honestly. But the other half is white.
A patch of white.

23:52.040 --> 23:54.952
Look, here I can see everything.

23:55.160 --> 23:58.630
Here I can still see my hand and here
it's gone. Here I can and here I can't.

23:58.840 --> 24:00.876
I don't know if it's there.
Understand?

24:01.080 --> 24:03.310
Is it still there? I don't know.

24:03.520 --> 24:06.592
What will happen
when everything has gone?

24:06.800 --> 24:09.394
How will I know
whether you are still there?

24:09.600 --> 24:12.433
That you haven't run off and
left me here with the bill?

24:12.640 --> 24:17.111
Thomas, you can't imagine
how beautiful everything is

24:17.320 --> 24:21.313
when you can only see half of it.
Honestly.

24:21.520 --> 24:25.354
My glass is half full, Thomas.

24:25.560 --> 24:27.630
And I cherish every single drop.

24:28.320 --> 24:33.394
But what will happen
when all my half-full glasses

24:35.240 --> 24:38.038
are emptied one by one,
right in front of me?

24:40.280 --> 24:41.872
What then?

24:44.200 --> 24:45.792
<i>In the event of balance problems,</i>

24:46.000 --> 24:49.117
<i>the difficulty of the exercises</i>
<i>is gradually increased.</i>

24:49.320 --> 24:54.189
<i>We start in a seated position,</i>
<i>one in which the patient feels safe.</i>

24:54.400 --> 24:58.996
<i>And then standing up,</i>
<i>which is a much less stable position.</i>

25:00.000 --> 25:04.073
You don't have to come and live here.
Just come along once a week.

25:04.280 --> 25:07.795
This place is top-notch.
- Top-notch?

25:08.000 --> 25:10.389
Is that what you call it?
Top-notch, hotchpotch.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.670
It's the best in the world, idiot.
- Great.

25:12.880 --> 25:15.394
<i>...urological and</i>
<i>genealogical problems,</i>

25:15.600 --> 25:18.353
<i>and use physiotherapy</i> to...

25:18.560 --> 25:21.552
Dr Lambert would like to see you.
- OK.

25:22.560 --> 25:25.791
OK if I leave you?
- Sure. Top-notch.

25:27.480 --> 25:31.029
<i>...weakened muscles and</i>
<i>balance problems...</i>

25:31.760 --> 25:33.318
Right. Fine.

25:34.160 --> 25:36.879
Hello.
- Ah, doctor.

25:37.080 --> 25:40.311
Thank you for seeing us so quickly.
- Yeah, yeah.

25:41.320 --> 25:44.835
Listen, I shall be honest with you.

25:45.040 --> 25:48.476
I think Mr Verstraete has got a nerve,
coming here

25:48.680 --> 25:51.433
after everything he's said in the press.

25:51.680 --> 25:56.071
<i>In order to prevent joint problems</i>
<i>and maintain mobility</i>

25:56.280 --> 26:02.469
<i>we carry out passive mobilisation</i>
<i>and stretching of spastic muscles.</i>

26:02.680 --> 26:05.956
<i>Some patients...</i>
<i>breathing exercises...</i>

26:06.160 --> 26:10.790
<i>language exercises... concentration...</i>
<i>treatment of the muscles...</i>

26:11.000 --> 26:15.869
<i>with targeted psychological tests</i>
<i>we check whether... sometimes...</i>

26:42.960 --> 26:48.239
If we were to give all these people
the impression, if only for a moment,

26:48.800 --> 26:53.316
that a gentle, painless injection
would put them out of their misery,

26:54.080 --> 26:56.230
we've opened the door.

26:56.520 --> 27:00.479
And then where will they find
the courage, every day, to...

27:04.680 --> 27:05.954
Hello, Mr Verstraete.

27:06.160 --> 27:09.391
I'm Dr Lambert.
- Hello, doctor.

27:09.600 --> 27:10.555
How are you?

27:12.120 --> 27:15.795
I've seen better films but I'm OK.
Top-notch.

27:16.880 --> 27:17.835
Right...

27:18.360 --> 27:22.911
Let's see what we can
maybe do for you here

27:23.120 --> 27:28.672
but I have to admit, you won't exactly be
the most popular patient here.

27:28.880 --> 27:29.835
Oh, right...

27:31.200 --> 27:34.875
Look, Mr Verstraete,
those are my heroes.

27:35.560 --> 27:39.269
Every day they have to concede
something, they lose something,

27:39.480 --> 27:43.268
but they don't give up, they carry on.
They carry on fighting.

27:43.480 --> 27:47.951
The idea that you would take away their
desire to live, their zest for life...

27:48.160 --> 27:52.995
I'm sorry, but to be honest,
I don't admire you for that.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.270
He means that...
- It's OK, Thomas.

27:55.480 --> 27:59.359
I don't want to take anything
away from anyone.

27:59.560 --> 28:03.269
I don't want anything.
I admire everyone here.

28:03.480 --> 28:07.439
And you too, doctor, but...

28:10.040 --> 28:11.314
Mario.

28:30.680 --> 28:32.318
Mario, wait a minute.

28:32.840 --> 28:33.989
Mario, wait.

28:46.840 --> 28:49.070
Are you OK?
- No, I'm not OK.

28:49.280 --> 28:52.670
No, I'm not OK.
I'm not alright. I'm not.

28:53.040 --> 28:54.996
Just wait a minute!

28:55.720 --> 28:56.994
For God's sake!

28:59.960 --> 29:02.679
I don't want to. I don't want to.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.359
Come on, mate.

29:04.560 --> 29:09.680
Bloody hell. Stupid... stupid body.

29:19.120 --> 29:20.997
It's OK, we're going back to the car.

29:27.600 --> 29:31.115
Hey, Jef.
We're strong in the Speck family.

29:31.760 --> 29:34.718
We cry a bit, in this valley of tears,

29:34.920 --> 29:38.595
act a bit silly
and resign ourselves to our fate.

29:38.960 --> 29:40.234
That's what life is like.

29:45.880 --> 29:48.997
It's a nasty illness,
when you see him like that.

29:51.000 --> 29:55.039
MS is an illness that can be bad or
not too bad at all. But in his case...

29:56.200 --> 29:58.350
In his case it's bad.

30:01.520 --> 30:06.196
You wonder why they were invented.
- Illnesses?

30:06.760 --> 30:08.990
To test us, I suppose.

30:10.360 --> 30:12.271
An experiment by God.

30:21.520 --> 30:24.717
I read you're intending to
try to convince the Senate.

30:25.640 --> 30:29.553
I've been invited as a member of
the Dying With Dignity pressure group.

30:30.320 --> 30:33.198
Well...
- It's good they want to listen, eh?

30:33.400 --> 30:36.358
Incredible they want to listen to you.

30:36.560 --> 30:41.588
Thomas doesn't want to take me,
I'm looking for a chauffeur.

30:41.800 --> 30:45.873
We always said we would infiltrate
the organs of state.

30:46.080 --> 30:48.640
Aren't you coming?
- No, I'm not.

30:48.840 --> 30:52.833
To stick bogies on the benches?
- No, I'm not coming.

30:53.040 --> 30:55.838
There are women there...
- No!

30:56.520 --> 30:58.556
That's the palace,
we want Rue de la Loi.

30:59.080 --> 31:01.753
We're not going to see the king,
we're going to the Senate.

31:01.960 --> 31:03.996
Shit. Here we go! Long live the King!

31:06.520 --> 31:08.272
Bloody hell!
- What?

31:08.680 --> 31:13.071
What's this, Speck?
Baby sick? Ricotta?

31:13.280 --> 31:16.829
I know, but they don't tell you that
when you have one.

31:17.160 --> 31:22.154
Everything you put in it comes out again
in strange forms and in huge quantities.

31:22.560 --> 31:24.835
But a good conversation,
you can forget that.

31:25.040 --> 31:26.951
Can you shut up, Speck?

31:28.920 --> 31:31.434
All those people.
- Wow! You're a star, pal.

31:32.040 --> 31:35.077
It's not about the right to die

31:35.280 --> 31:37.999
but about the right to live a full life.

31:38.200 --> 31:41.078
As you know,
I've got multiple sclerosis

31:41.280 --> 31:44.078
but I still really enjoy life.

31:44.280 --> 31:47.556
I'm going to carry on until
I can't do it any more and I hope

31:47.760 --> 31:52.834
that day is in the very distant future.
But when it comes, I won't be afraid.

31:53.640 --> 31:58.714
He made it into the Senate.
- I'd rather he'd done it differently.

31:58.920 --> 32:00.751
...and protracted suffering...

32:01.240 --> 32:02.832
Look, that other guy is here.

32:03.200 --> 32:04.553
Dr Death.

32:04.760 --> 32:08.116
And I hope to be able to include you
among these people.

32:08.480 --> 32:09.708
Thank you.

32:09.920 --> 32:15.995
Thank you, Mr Verstraete,
for this very human testimony.

32:16.200 --> 32:19.351
Who would like the floor?

32:19.560 --> 32:25.237
Mr Verstraete, don't get me wrong,
I understand your situation

32:25.440 --> 32:28.796
but do you have any idea of
the snowball effect

32:29.000 --> 32:33.312
that your possibly rather
selfish act will cause?

32:33.520 --> 32:37.798
Mr Verstraete, I understand your anxiety
regarding your declining health,

32:38.000 --> 32:42.994
but your desire to sideline science
is, in my opinion, questionable.

32:43.480 --> 32:49.191
Huge progress has been made in
controlling pain in recent years.

32:49.440 --> 32:53.991
I wonder if you've asked your doctors
and looked into it in sufficient detail.

32:54.200 --> 32:58.830
This amounts to suicide and,
by extension, to murder.

32:59.040 --> 33:04.512
Murder with the knowledge,
the complicity of the doctors.

33:05.040 --> 33:10.512
But I hope... I sincerely hope
you will find the strength to live.

33:11.240 --> 33:15.358
<i>And not to die.</i>
<i>Everyone can do that.</i>

33:15.800 --> 33:18.633
<i>Dr Frank Valaeys</i>
<i>from Dying With Dignity</i>

33:18.840 --> 33:21.912
<i>also thinks Mario Verstraete's testimony</i>
<i>is very important.</i>

33:22.120 --> 33:28.150
<i>What he wants to show and defend</i>
<i>is the fact that the patient</i>

33:28.360 --> 33:30.430
<i>has the right to control his life...</i>

33:30.640 --> 33:33.632
You can say what you like
but I'm not sure about Dr Ghoul.

33:33.840 --> 33:37.355
<i>It is important for the grieving</i>
<i>process of those left behind</i>

33:37.560 --> 33:40.199
<i>that the death is experienced</i>
<i>in a positive way.</i>

33:40.400 --> 33:44.154
OK, a positive experience. I can't wait.
The sooner the better, eh?

33:44.600 --> 33:46.079
Hand me my crutch.

33:49.200 --> 33:50.428
I knew you'd do that.

33:51.280 --> 33:53.794
And the other one.
- Not again.

33:55.080 --> 33:58.072
This is one of our better models.
Top of the range.

33:58.520 --> 34:02.069
It's easy to control.
On-off, forwards, backwards.

34:02.280 --> 34:06.671
And here there's a belt...
- Is that necessary? Hey, Milan.

34:06.880 --> 34:10.634
Be careful.
- Milan, Milan, Milan. Sorry, sir.

34:13.639 --> 34:15.232
Hold on.
- Brilliant.

34:16.639 --> 34:19.359
Hey, our...
- Oh, sorry. Sorry.

34:24.040 --> 34:25.678
We're being followed.

34:27.560 --> 34:30.279
Go, go.
- Sit down, sit down.

34:30.480 --> 34:33.152
No, it's OK, it's OK.
- Sorry. Is everything OK? Sorry.

34:33.400 --> 34:36.995
No problem.
- We'll take it.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.239
Right.
- Yes.

34:40.360 --> 34:43.237
Faster.
- That's some pan flute!

34:43.560 --> 34:45.915
Keep straight, keep straight,
keep straight...

34:47.199 --> 34:49.475
We'll end up in the bushes.

34:53.320 --> 34:54.230
Hello.

34:54.440 --> 34:56.431
Daddy.
- What lovely weather.

34:56.639 --> 35:02.078
In a minute we're going to go over the
handlebars, crash, explode and die.

35:04.680 --> 35:05.999
Dangerous lunatic!

35:06.880 --> 35:08.871
We survived, my son.
- Hold me.

35:10.240 --> 35:14.119
There, a dog. Get the dog. That's it.

36:08.880 --> 36:12.111
That was fantastic.
- Very nice.

36:12.320 --> 36:13.275
Fantastic.

36:14.400 --> 36:16.197
You've left your light on.
- Oh yeah...

36:21.320 --> 36:23.754
You think it's a shame
you can't push me, eh?

36:23.960 --> 36:28.954
Pushing engenders sympathy.
- Helping a handicapped guy.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.749
Those stairs aren't a good idea.
- It's alright.

36:34.120 --> 36:36.918
I do like mountaineers do,
rest now and then.

36:38.160 --> 36:39.752
I'm going to carry you.
- What?

36:39.960 --> 36:41.393
I'm going to carry you.
- No.

36:41.600 --> 36:42.919
Yes, Mario.
- Oh, Thomas.

36:43.120 --> 36:44.917
Come on. Don't.

36:45.120 --> 36:47.350
You wanted to help me.
- That's not helping.

36:48.200 --> 36:49.349
Sorry.

36:49.720 --> 36:52.359
I always dreamt of being in your arms.
- I can imagine.

36:52.560 --> 36:54.437
You, Tarzan, me...
- A faggot.

36:59.640 --> 37:03.553
Going to be able to manage?
- Yes, I'm a big boy.

37:04.480 --> 37:06.675
I can go to the loo by myself.

37:10.920 --> 37:12.239
Look. Look.

37:12.800 --> 37:14.199
My leg.

37:14.720 --> 37:17.712
That's my body saying,
'Fuck you, I'm not playing any more.'

37:19.240 --> 37:21.595
It bends upwards every night.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.949
I have to push it back down
but it comes back up.

37:28.920 --> 37:33.710
Does that hurt?
- Ever had cramp when swimming?

37:33.920 --> 37:36.309
It's like that, all night long.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.319
I'm bearing up, Thomas.

37:40.760 --> 37:43.957
But let's be honest,
I'm not getting any better, eh?

37:50.920 --> 37:51.909
Fuck...

38:01.240 --> 38:03.151
I'm going to push a bit further.
- OK.

38:05.920 --> 38:09.469
If it hurts, hold your finger up.
- Just 'ow' isn't enough?

38:09.720 --> 38:13.030
That's not so clear.
Your finger is better.

38:13.560 --> 38:14.959
Here we go.

38:16.680 --> 38:18.830
OK.

38:20.440 --> 38:23.512
You like that, don't you?
Hurting people.

38:24.480 --> 38:26.471
That's why I do this job.

38:27.360 --> 38:29.715
I used to go to S&M clubs.

38:30.920 --> 38:33.912
S&M clubs?
- You should try it, it's great.

38:34.200 --> 38:36.873
Fantastic. But they kicked me out.

38:37.080 --> 38:42.029
I hurt everyone too much.
And it's dear. Expensive.

38:42.840 --> 38:45.513
All that equipment.
All those balls in your mouth.

38:46.520 --> 38:49.910
Balls in your mouth?
- Bowls, bowls.

38:53.360 --> 38:54.918
Can I see your diploma?

38:55.160 --> 38:59.073
Think about it, Francine.
Come and live here.

38:59.920 --> 39:02.559
In the big city for a change.
- He doesn't want us to.

39:02.760 --> 39:08.551
It's not up to him. Then you don't
have to keep going back and forth.

39:10.160 --> 39:12.310
It'd be easier.

39:12.600 --> 39:17.674
We put our coats on and leave
in the evening and go upstairs.

39:17.880 --> 39:22.635
In the morning we come down, take our
coats off and ask if he slept well.

39:22.840 --> 39:27.231
We'll have to be quiet.
- We can do it quietly.

39:30.040 --> 39:31.155
Watch out.

39:32.200 --> 39:33.599
Throw it.

39:34.760 --> 39:36.716
That's perfect. There you are.

39:44.920 --> 39:50.074
'Every morning at 8 o'clock
I have a huge bowel movement.'

39:50.280 --> 39:54.956
'Great,' says the doctor. 'Regular
bowel movements are a good sign.'

39:55.160 --> 39:57.310
That's important.
- 'That's good.'

39:57.520 --> 40:00.080
'Yes, doctor, but I don't wake up
until 9 o'clock.'

40:03.800 --> 40:05.870
That's a good one.
- Yeah, eh?

40:08.640 --> 40:10.710
Right. So tell me...

40:12.920 --> 40:17.038
How is the plumbing?
- A few leaks.

40:17.440 --> 40:20.716
Leaking pipes.
My body's 'taking the piss'!

40:22.240 --> 40:23.389
What about the rest?

40:25.240 --> 40:26.389
Well...

40:28.200 --> 40:31.636
Things are a bit limp down there.

40:32.280 --> 40:34.077
It sleeps even more than me.

40:40.280 --> 40:43.158
I think your chauffeur's here, sir.
- Yeah.

40:44.880 --> 40:46.791
I'll just check your reflexes.

40:47.760 --> 40:50.069
Yes, they're still working OK.

40:51.320 --> 40:53.993
Got the right shoes on, Dad?
- Yeah, yeah.

40:54.640 --> 40:57.677
Incredible. You're walking to Lourdes?

40:58.360 --> 41:02.592
I can't give you a lift, eh? Otherwise
it won't count as a pilgrimage.

41:03.320 --> 41:04.594
Not even a little way?

41:04.800 --> 41:07.155
Having faith is healthy.
Gets you out of the house.

41:07.360 --> 41:09.954
Good thing Lourdes is near Oostakker.

41:10.160 --> 41:12.879
Otherwise it'd take you a while.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.788
Nice of the mayor to send his own driver
to collect his staff.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.309
Yes. But look.

41:22.960 --> 41:25.633
He was writing a speech yesterday.
And I read it.

41:25.840 --> 41:27.831
There aren't any vowels
in half the words.

41:28.520 --> 41:29.509
Keep praying, Dad.

41:29.720 --> 41:33.429
And if I'm not cured
then Our Lady of Lourdes is deaf.

41:33.880 --> 41:37.270
I said to him to give it to me,
I'd copy it out neatly

41:37.480 --> 41:40.358
but he said I didn't need to,
it was fine like that.

41:41.680 --> 41:43.750
If... If he can't work any more,

41:43.960 --> 41:48.158
can't read the paper,
can't follow politics...

41:52.360 --> 41:53.475
<i>The 1 O'clock News.</i>

41:53.680 --> 41:57.753
<i>The Senate's committee on euthanasia</i>
<i>has finished its work.</i>

41:57.960 --> 42:03.080
<i>The final text of the legislative bill</i>
<i>has been drafted and sent to the Senate.</i>

42:03.280 --> 42:07.034
<i>The question is will Belgium become</i>
<i>the second country after the Netherlands</i>

42:07.240 --> 42:10.994
<i>in which euthanasia is legal</i>
<i>in certain cases?</i>

42:11.200 --> 42:14.431
<i>The principle of the bill</i> is...

42:14.880 --> 42:18.190
See you later, Robert.
- Yeah.

42:18.400 --> 42:19.594
Be good.

42:29.720 --> 42:32.996
It's very dusty and...

42:33.400 --> 42:37.393
your film wasn't in there properly.
- Thank you.

42:38.840 --> 42:41.638
Hello. I'm looking for
a really big present.

42:41.960 --> 42:43.951
Size isn't always important, eh sir?

42:44.160 --> 42:46.958
It's the quality that matters.

42:47.160 --> 42:52.439
Thomas, come here.
Long time no see, Thomas!

42:53.120 --> 42:55.918
That's some service you get here.
- Always.

42:56.120 --> 42:59.271
Hey, Dr Love.

42:59.640 --> 43:01.631
How are you?
- Fine, fine.

43:01.840 --> 43:04.832
It could always be better,
but I'm fine.

43:06.680 --> 43:10.389
And Mario?
- Well... Good and not good.

43:10.600 --> 43:14.639
He hasn't changed. He sees another good
cause as a matter of life and death,

43:14.840 --> 43:16.796
but a bit too literally this time.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.834
I'm sure you've heard.
- Yes.

43:23.400 --> 43:26.392
I haven't got round to going to see him.
- That's OK.

43:26.600 --> 43:30.036
No, it's not OK. I feel really guilty.

43:30.240 --> 43:32.231
The guiltier I feel,
the less I dare go

43:32.440 --> 43:34.510
and the guiltier I feel...

43:35.120 --> 43:36.189
That's alright.

43:38.040 --> 43:41.271
But I need a present.
- A big one.

43:46.600 --> 43:49.592
Long shall he live. Or is that
going too far? Yes, let's sing it.

43:49.920 --> 43:54.516
<i>Long shall he live, long shall he live.</i>
- He says not very long, but still...

43:54.720 --> 43:57.188
<i>In glory.</i>

43:57.400 --> 43:59.914
<i>In glory.</i>

44:00.120 --> 44:01.758
Hip hip hip.
- Hurrah!

44:01.960 --> 44:03.791
Hip hip hip.
- Hurrah!

44:04.000 --> 44:06.389
There! I thought someone was missing.

44:06.640 --> 44:09.518
Look who's here.
Superman.

44:09.720 --> 44:11.676
A serious guest at last.

44:11.880 --> 44:14.269
You look like a dog with two tails.
Emphasis on dog!

44:14.480 --> 44:17.313
I've brought you two presents.
The first one...

44:19.200 --> 44:20.428
For your collection.

44:20.640 --> 44:22.915
Now I can wear my underpants
on top of my trousers.

44:23.120 --> 44:26.078
You can laugh but Christopher Reeves
is going to make a film.

44:26.280 --> 44:27.872
Yes, with his chin.

44:28.080 --> 44:31.959
The second present is
a phenomenal toy.

44:32.160 --> 44:35.038
Full option.
And you still know how to use it.

44:35.760 --> 44:37.034
Ready?

44:41.040 --> 44:42.029
Hi...

44:43.280 --> 44:45.635
Hi...
- Hello, Mario.

44:48.960 --> 44:51.633
Happy birthday, hero of mine.

44:55.520 --> 44:56.555
Hello, Lynn.

44:57.760 --> 45:00.832
I've brought you an extra present.
For your ego.

45:01.040 --> 45:04.794
It's the Genius edition.
- Trivial Pursuit.

45:05.680 --> 45:09.832
Lynn, if life were a question,
you'd be the answer.

45:10.440 --> 45:13.318
That's a good one.
I'm going to remember that.

45:15.040 --> 45:16.314
Lynn...

45:19.640 --> 45:23.189
One, one, one.
- Right. Brown.

45:23.400 --> 45:28.520
Beatles fans crossed which road 25 years
after the LP of the same name appeared?

45:28.720 --> 45:32.998
Oh, thingy... Abbey Road.
- Correct.

45:36.080 --> 45:39.993
How many front claws has a parrot got?
- Two?

45:40.680 --> 45:44.116
Correct.
- I've thrown a six.

45:46.760 --> 45:48.239
Two. You can throw again.

45:49.200 --> 45:50.553
One. Orange.

45:52.520 --> 45:54.476
Again.
- Is that a thingy? No.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.275
Come on, Mario.
- A good one. A good one.

46:00.480 --> 46:01.833
And he throws the dice.

46:03.960 --> 46:07.475
Green. Ladies and gentlemen,
the tension is mounting.

46:07.680 --> 46:12.151
Is he going to beat the previous winner,
Dr Thomas, who's in great shape?

46:12.360 --> 46:15.636
Mario is not in such good shape,
but still...

46:15.840 --> 46:17.478
I can say that, eh?

46:18.120 --> 46:23.478
Which archipelago inspired
Charles Darwin's theory of evolution?

46:29.320 --> 46:31.629
I know it. Come on.

46:32.160 --> 46:35.152
Hold on. Charles Darwin...

46:35.360 --> 46:38.477
An archipelago. That's easy.

46:39.240 --> 46:41.435
Come on, say it.
- The Galapagos Islands.

46:41.800 --> 46:42.835
Exactly.

46:43.760 --> 46:47.116
You told me to say it.
- It was my question.

46:47.320 --> 46:49.754
Give me another question.
That's not fair.

46:50.440 --> 46:52.670
Music. For a wedge.

46:52.880 --> 46:56.873
What was Bob Marley's
legendary group called?

46:58.640 --> 46:59.868
Of course.

47:00.080 --> 47:01.035
Come on.

47:03.120 --> 47:04.109
Fuck!

47:05.160 --> 47:08.357
Come on, I know it.
Of course, it's...

47:08.960 --> 47:13.590
Hold on. I know it. Shit. Fuck!

47:13.800 --> 47:16.075
I'll tell you.
- No, Mum.

47:17.760 --> 47:18.715
Bloody hell!

47:21.800 --> 47:25.952
You don't have to answer. It's not
your question. You just ask it.

47:26.200 --> 47:31.593
D'you think I can't remember,
that I'll never remember? Do you?

47:32.403 --> 47:34.519
Hey...
- What?

47:34.723 --> 47:37.157
You 'wail' remember.

47:38.883 --> 47:41.192
Wailers. The Wailers.

47:43.323 --> 47:44.881
I slept with them.

47:46.403 --> 47:49.554
With the Wailers. All of them.
At the same time.

47:50.123 --> 47:52.273
That's a lot at once,
there's eighteen of them.

47:54.003 --> 47:56.517
It's not true, Francine.

47:59.043 --> 48:00.840
Come on, let's carry on playing.

48:03.563 --> 48:05.554
There. Three.

48:06.603 --> 48:09.913
Come on, come out of my stomach, child.

48:10.123 --> 48:11.841
Being born...

48:13.843 --> 48:15.640
I'm alive.
- Yes, you're alive.

48:15.843 --> 48:17.117
At last.
- Mum's here.

48:17.523 --> 48:19.275
Two kids in one T-shirt.

48:19.883 --> 48:21.953
I don't believe it.
- Hello, Mummy.

48:22.163 --> 48:24.119
I'm off.
- Bye, Mummy.

48:24.323 --> 48:26.359
Here.
- Ah, some water.

48:26.563 --> 48:27.598
Thank you, Mummy.

48:33.563 --> 48:36.123
Give here. Right, bye.

48:38.003 --> 48:42.599
Bloody hell, Mario, you're like
a little kid. Do you have to?

48:44.443 --> 48:45.398
I'm off.

48:47.563 --> 48:49.315
That was good, eh?

48:53.563 --> 48:55.997
Enjoy yourselves. Bye.
- Bye.

48:56.403 --> 48:58.280
Let's have a sleep.

48:58.483 --> 49:00.758
Bye.
- Bye.

49:09.563 --> 49:10.552
And now we're awake.

49:14.723 --> 49:15.712
And now we're asleep.

49:17.163 --> 49:18.152
Listen.

49:19.923 --> 49:21.322
Can you hear it?

49:22.483 --> 49:23.598
Now.

49:25.483 --> 49:26.552
This...

49:32.203 --> 49:34.398
Those are the seconds.

49:34.603 --> 49:38.232
It's night-time,
we're in a palace in Venice.

49:40.363 --> 49:41.876
The seconds are ticking past.

49:42.083 --> 49:45.837
The story starts in the evening
and ends in the morning.

49:46.043 --> 49:50.002
The hours are passing.
The Dance Of The Hours.

49:50.203 --> 49:51.431
That's what it's called.

49:52.083 --> 49:55.393
I don't like it.
- That's not possible.

49:55.603 --> 49:59.232
You can't not like that.
- Maybe, but I don't.

49:59.443 --> 50:02.958
Really? Then get out of my T-shirt!

50:04.083 --> 50:08.599
Can I go and play football?
- That depends.

50:08.843 --> 50:10.754
How do you spell 'I will become'?

50:12.483 --> 50:14.872
I will become what? What will I become?

50:15.083 --> 50:17.392
Doesn't matter. How do you spell it?

50:17.603 --> 50:21.039
It's more important to know
what you want to become

50:21.243 --> 50:23.552
than how to spell it.

50:24.163 --> 50:28.202
Smart aleck.
So what do you want to become?

50:29.163 --> 50:31.631
Really want to become?
- Yes, really.

50:32.683 --> 50:33.672
A doctor.

50:36.483 --> 50:40.032
To do that you first have to know
how to spell 'I will become'.

50:40.683 --> 50:43.038
I do know.
- Do you? How?

50:43.243 --> 50:44.801
With a W.

50:45.803 --> 50:48.954
With a W! Go on,
go and play <i>wootball.</i>

50:51.443 --> 50:54.196
With a W.
From <i>wootball.</i>

51:09.843 --> 51:11.196
This is fantastic.

51:18.683 --> 51:21.675
It reminds me a bit of Fleetwood Mac.

51:23.123 --> 51:25.876
Fleetwood Mac?
- Heard of them?

51:26.963 --> 51:29.238
Yes.
- Good.

51:29.443 --> 51:35.200
This reminds you of Fleetwood Mac?
- Not all of it, but...

51:38.403 --> 51:39.722
Some parts.

51:41.843 --> 51:44.915
Have you seen it, mini Speckolino?
There, the sea.

51:45.123 --> 51:48.001
No there, the other side.
That big wet thing over there.

51:48.243 --> 51:51.360
You're as smart as your father.
- Come on, Milan, push.

51:51.763 --> 51:52.991
Push, Milan.

51:53.963 --> 51:55.794
When you sit in a wheelchair,
it's as if

51:56.003 --> 51:58.915
you've not only lost the use
of your legs but your brain too.

51:59.483 --> 52:00.916
If you ask someone a question,

52:01.243 --> 52:04.872
two out of three reply to
the person pushing you. Watch.

52:05.083 --> 52:09.315
Excuse me, miss. Do you know
where the closest toilets are?

52:09.523 --> 52:12.321
The best thing to do is turn round.

52:12.523 --> 52:15.799
See that hotel there? There's a toilet
there, but you have to pay.

52:16.003 --> 52:18.233
I think it should be accessible for you.

52:18.443 --> 52:19.398
Alright.
- OK.

52:19.603 --> 52:21.355
Good luck. Bye.
- Bye.

52:23.083 --> 52:24.880
Did you see it?
- I saw it.

52:25.083 --> 52:28.473
A nice pair though.
- A dynamic duo.

52:28.683 --> 52:30.878
And they say
there are no hills in Holland.

52:31.403 --> 52:33.633
Do we have to watch
Belgium-Holland in Holland?

52:33.843 --> 52:35.322
Yes, we have to.

53:11.123 --> 53:12.442
Look at little Jef.

53:12.643 --> 53:16.761
Man is the only animal who comes into
the world so helpless and defenceless.

53:16.963 --> 53:19.602
A foal pops out.
And jumps a few fences.

53:19.803 --> 53:23.352
But we... look, it doesn't
do anything. Just sits there.

53:23.563 --> 53:26.031
That's because of our big stupid head.

53:26.243 --> 53:30.077
We have to come out before it's fully
grown, otherwise we'll get stuck.

53:30.283 --> 53:34.037
That's why we're born before
we're ready. We're unfinished.

53:34.243 --> 53:38.031
It's also due to the size of that
brilliant brain that we live too long.

53:38.243 --> 53:40.996
With inventions like drips
and Zimmer frames and stuff.

53:41.203 --> 53:44.673
While you just lay there dribbling.
- Calm down.

53:44.923 --> 53:45.878
Is he at it again?

53:46.083 --> 53:48.802
Life is a short bridge
between helpless and helpless.

53:49.163 --> 53:53.918
Crap. Who's helpless?
Go on, tell me. Who's helpless?

53:54.123 --> 53:58.082
Your theory's wrong. Man is the only
animal who continues to care for others.

53:58.283 --> 54:01.639
You look after Jef, and you Milan.
- But that makes sense.

54:01.843 --> 54:05.882
And we look after you, idiot.
We're here, we're not going anywhere.

54:06.083 --> 54:08.517
And you're definitely
not going anywhere.

54:08.723 --> 54:11.362
Remember? Leave no man behind?
They're your words.

54:12.003 --> 54:15.916
We're not going to leave anyone behind.
No one.

54:16.123 --> 54:19.957
If there's anyone we're definitely
not going to leave behind, it's you.

54:33.123 --> 54:36.911
Come on, Holland, come on!
- Thomas, could you inject him now?

54:37.123 --> 54:38.192
Yeah, I could.

54:47.483 --> 54:48.757
Don't put him on.

54:49.283 --> 54:50.841
Oh, come on!

55:11.083 --> 55:12.402
You stink, pal.

55:12.603 --> 55:14.833
You stink of Belgium.

55:16.923 --> 55:18.276
Fuck this.

55:18.683 --> 55:19.638
Fuck this.

55:19.843 --> 55:22.403
It happens, Mario. Come on.

55:23.563 --> 55:26.123
I try...
- Of course you do.

55:26.643 --> 55:31.717
For Mum, for Dad.
For Milan and for you lot.

55:32.523 --> 55:33.558
But...

55:37.483 --> 55:38.802
Things are looking grim.

55:40.163 --> 55:42.313
Things are looking grim, guys.

55:53.483 --> 55:56.680
Working from home is
the modern thing to do.

55:56.883 --> 56:01.274
I wouldn't mind doing it but
I can hardly drive my car round at home.

56:01.843 --> 56:03.117
It's not finished.

56:03.643 --> 56:09.320
It... I haven't...
I haven't finished it.

56:09.523 --> 56:12.196
Don't worry about it,
I'll just tell him...

56:12.403 --> 56:14.553
I can't see very well any more.

56:14.803 --> 56:18.478
It's getting hard to write,
the speech isn't finished.

56:18.803 --> 56:22.352
Don't worry, you know the mayor,
he'll improvise.

56:22.563 --> 56:26.078
'It is a great honour to be here today,
blah blah blah.'

56:26.283 --> 56:27.796
And before you know it...

56:35.163 --> 56:37.961
Look after yourself,
that's the important thing.

56:38.683 --> 56:40.833
The rest will sort itself out.

57:07.043 --> 57:08.271
Fuck.

59:13.643 --> 59:15.235
I can't do it.

59:16.883 --> 59:17.838
OK.

59:44.963 --> 59:45.998
Thomas...

01:00:22.123 --> 01:00:23.112
Well...

01:00:28.443 --> 01:00:30.161
I can't do it like this.

01:00:32.163 --> 01:00:33.596
I mustn't.

01:00:35.163 --> 01:00:36.312
But I don't know if...

01:00:38.243 --> 01:00:40.359
if I can keep going for much longer.

01:00:42.563 --> 01:00:44.918
I'm losing, Thomas.

01:00:46.803 --> 01:00:49.795
I'm losing my mind.
- You don't know that.

01:00:50.003 --> 01:00:52.881
Yes, I do. I do know it, Thomas, I do.

01:00:54.203 --> 01:00:55.318
I can feel it.

01:00:58.883 --> 01:01:02.273
I'm drowning.
My body is already underwater.

01:01:04.363 --> 01:01:06.115
And the water is rising.

01:01:08.683 --> 01:01:11.993
And soon my head will be underwater too.

01:01:13.323 --> 01:01:16.076
What will be left then? Nothing.

01:01:16.483 --> 01:01:19.998
All I know is,
it won't be me that's left.

01:01:20.683 --> 01:01:24.119
But we will know it's you.
We will know.

01:01:24.323 --> 01:01:27.918
Your parents, and Milan.
We will know.

01:01:30.523 --> 01:01:33.833
You promised him
you'd be there to see him graduate.

01:01:37.483 --> 01:01:38.916
What for?

01:01:39.843 --> 01:01:43.802
To give him what as a present?
A father who's a vegetable.

01:01:44.603 --> 01:01:47.037
To be there. Just to be there.

01:01:48.243 --> 01:01:50.552
To be there.
- Yes, to be there.

01:02:17.963 --> 01:02:19.954
I've still got my slippers on.

01:02:22.563 --> 01:02:24.599
Me too.
- Oh yeah...

01:02:56.403 --> 01:02:57.836
Go to sleep.

01:03:03.163 --> 01:03:05.119
<i>After years of fierce debating,</i>

01:03:05.323 --> 01:03:09.919
<i>there is to be a marathon session</i>
<i>on euthanasia in the Senate this week.</i>

01:03:10.123 --> 01:03:12.683
<i>When he really cannot go on,</i>

01:03:12.883 --> 01:03:18.037
<i>who are we to tell the patient</i>
<i>he has to keep going?</i>

01:03:18.283 --> 01:03:21.241
<i>The principle of the bill</i>
<i>is that a doctor may end</i>

01:03:21.443 --> 01:03:24.116
<i>his patient's life</i>
<i>if the latter requests this himself</i>

01:03:24.523 --> 01:03:27.083
<i>and if his suffering</i>
<i>has become unbearable.</i>

01:03:27.363 --> 01:03:30.958
<i>This request for euthanasia must be</i>
<i>properly thought through and be repeated</i>

01:03:31.163 --> 01:03:34.758
<i>and be checked by three doctors...</i>

01:04:02.323 --> 01:04:03.597
Hello, Robert.

01:04:19.163 --> 01:04:24.760
You can just alleviate the pain,
reduce the suffering.

01:04:24.963 --> 01:04:27.921
But that is 95% of what we do anyway.

01:04:28.643 --> 01:04:32.556
And we mustn't forget that
less than 20 years ago

01:04:32.763 --> 01:04:37.200
palliative care was not allowed,
even though we think it normal today.

01:04:37.403 --> 01:04:43.114
But what was allowed was for someone
to lay there dying like an animal.

01:04:43.323 --> 01:04:47.839
Until a nurse on the night shift, or a
brave doctor, could stand it no longer

01:04:48.043 --> 01:04:51.922
and at night, behind a curtain, quickly

01:04:52.123 --> 01:04:55.274
gave them one injection too many or
a dose that was just a bit too high

01:04:55.483 --> 01:04:58.202
and the patient was
put out of their misery.

01:04:58.563 --> 01:05:01.475
Do we want to carry on like that?

01:05:01.683 --> 01:05:05.562
That is the question
the Senate has to answer this week.

01:05:05.763 --> 01:05:08.323
And I hope the answer is a positive one.

01:05:08.523 --> 01:05:09.876
Well, positive...

01:05:10.643 --> 01:05:12.315
You know what I mean.

01:05:14.203 --> 01:05:15.682
Thank you very much.

01:05:21.203 --> 01:05:23.319
I'm glad you came.

01:05:23.523 --> 01:05:27.516
There's something I'd like to say as
I don't think you really understand me.

01:05:27.723 --> 01:05:32.239
I would think it awful too if Mario
were to decide to die at some point.

01:05:32.443 --> 01:05:34.718
It would be terrible.
- More than terrible.

01:05:34.923 --> 01:05:36.834
Yes, more than terrible.

01:05:37.043 --> 01:05:41.878
This law doesn't make him do it, it just
gives him the opportunity to do it.

01:05:42.083 --> 01:05:45.075
Gives him a choice, which is important
for a patient, isn't it?

01:05:45.283 --> 01:05:46.511
I don't know.

01:05:46.723 --> 01:05:49.521
Call me naive,
but I became a doctor to help people.

01:05:49.723 --> 01:05:51.759
I wanted to save lives.
- Of course.

01:05:51.963 --> 01:05:54.318
I can't imagine me...

01:05:54.523 --> 01:05:58.914
I wouldn't know how...
- You don't have to.

01:06:01.603 --> 01:06:04.242
But this law is going to be passed?

01:06:05.363 --> 01:06:07.354
Yes, it looks like it.

01:06:08.603 --> 01:06:11.515
<i>69 members took part in the vote.</i>
<i>44 voted in favour...</i>

01:06:11.723 --> 01:06:15.796
<i>It's an important first step.</i>
<i>This law permits doctors...</i>

01:06:16.003 --> 01:06:19.473
<i>not just to help people get better</i>

01:06:19.683 --> 01:06:22.675
<i>but also to help them die.</i>
<i>That is very important.</i>

01:06:22.883 --> 01:06:25.522
<i>The Catholic Church has reacted sharply.</i>

01:06:25.723 --> 01:06:30.080
<i>Wishing someone dead</i>
<i>is absolutely monstrous.</i>

01:06:30.283 --> 01:06:32.843
Are you alright, Francine?
- Yes.

01:06:33.803 --> 01:06:35.714
It hasn't come as a surprise, eh?
- No.

01:06:36.403 --> 01:06:38.678
I'm more worried for Roger.

01:06:40.363 --> 01:06:42.923
<i>After the Senate the bill</i>
<i>will go to the Lower Chamber,</i>

01:06:43.123 --> 01:06:44.715
<i>but its opponents say...</i>

01:06:44.923 --> 01:06:51.237
<i>An historic step, but for us an historic</i>
<i>step too far that we will not follow.</i>

01:06:53.763 --> 01:06:56.402
I saw my grandmother die
a slow, painful death.

01:06:57.003 --> 01:07:02.316
For seven months, every hour of the day,
she tried to pull her oxygen mask off

01:07:02.523 --> 01:07:06.482
and for seven months it was replaced.
- We would like to interview you.

01:07:06.683 --> 01:07:09.561
Until she finally died.

01:07:09.763 --> 01:07:14.883
We've all experienced this...
- Because you are his doctor.

01:07:15.083 --> 01:07:17.517
People who have had enough,
who are worn out.

01:07:17.723 --> 01:07:23.639
If doctors see any way of possibly
extending that life, they will do so.

01:07:23.843 --> 01:07:27.916
Suicide is permitted.
Well, it's not, but what can they do?

01:07:28.123 --> 01:07:30.398
They can hardly
shoot you for it afterwards.

01:07:30.603 --> 01:07:33.675
He's the one you want.
He fits the picture better.

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:36.317
But dying painlessly in dignity,

01:07:36.523 --> 01:07:39.117
saying goodbye,
why isn't that allowed?

01:07:39.323 --> 01:07:42.599
Maybe we all need to
learn to cope with death better.

01:07:42.803 --> 01:07:46.921
Then maybe we could
learn to cope with life better too.

01:07:54.763 --> 01:07:56.481
We got some good stuff.
- Great.

01:08:00.643 --> 01:08:03.999
Hello, Frank.
- Did it go OK?

01:08:04.203 --> 01:08:08.640
The pain is killing me but as Che
Guevara said, 'Until victory always!'

01:08:09.803 --> 01:08:10.952
Would you like a drink?

01:08:12.163 --> 01:08:14.199
Going to join us in a drink?
- No, I'm off.

01:08:14.403 --> 01:08:15.882
What's the matter?
- Nothing.

01:08:16.122 --> 01:08:20.321
Smoke and drink a bit more,
then you can spout some more crap.

01:08:20.683 --> 01:08:24.961
Am I supposed to stop smoking now?
- Ask your doctor.

01:08:30.203 --> 01:08:32.080
It sucks, eh?

01:08:32.843 --> 01:08:37.678
And we're going to interview Valaeys.
That could be interesting.

01:08:37.883 --> 01:08:41.000
Ah, Thomas. Can you give me a lift?

01:08:41.523 --> 01:08:45.277
Thomas, we can't do this.
We really can't.

01:08:45.483 --> 01:08:46.471
God is watching us.

01:08:46.883 --> 01:08:51.752
And... And you have to tell Mario.
You have to tell him.

01:08:51.962 --> 01:08:54.557
It isn't up to us to take a life.

01:08:54.763 --> 01:08:58.801
Who is it up to then?
- Him. He gives and He takes.

01:08:59.002 --> 01:09:01.517
When He thinks the time has come?
- Yes.

01:09:03.122 --> 01:09:07.002
Let's be honest, Roger.
Us doctors also intervene.

01:09:07.203 --> 01:09:09.194
We extend lives.

01:09:09.403 --> 01:09:12.554
You can't compare that
to killing someone.

01:09:13.962 --> 01:09:17.399
Life is sacred and
it's the only one we've got.

01:09:17.923 --> 01:09:20.720
So Mario should...
- No, he should grit his teeth.

01:09:20.923 --> 01:09:24.518
What if they come up with a drug
tomorrow that can cure him?

01:09:24.723 --> 01:09:26.759
What will we say then?

01:09:27.923 --> 01:09:30.312
Is that why you come here?
- Yes.

01:09:30.523 --> 01:09:34.880
Our Lady can help me,
I've bought enough candles.

01:09:36.603 --> 01:09:38.321
How about I treat you to a candle?

01:09:47.122 --> 01:09:51.116
You know, Lynn,
over the years...

01:09:52.723 --> 01:09:56.159
with every hour of every week
and every month,

01:09:56.363 --> 01:09:58.752
you have become more
and more beautiful.

01:10:00.883 --> 01:10:02.032
Of course.

01:10:02.243 --> 01:10:04.473
What?
- Everyone knows that.

01:10:06.843 --> 01:10:09.801
Yeah, but I knew
right from the beginning.

01:10:10.763 --> 01:10:12.719
How beautiful you were.

01:10:15.363 --> 01:10:18.594
And how fantastic
you always thought I was.

01:10:19.843 --> 01:10:21.481
And rightly so.

01:10:26.483 --> 01:10:28.519
I can hardly see you any more.

01:10:36.403 --> 01:10:38.075
But I still love the sight of you.

01:10:59.203 --> 01:11:00.431
Sorry.

01:11:01.723 --> 01:11:02.758
Fuck.

01:11:03.763 --> 01:11:06.675
I'm the one who's sorry.
- No, sorry.

01:11:06.883 --> 01:11:09.238
I have to go. I have to...

01:11:10.043 --> 01:11:11.522
Yeah, you have to go.

01:11:13.403 --> 01:11:17.237
Could you just give me a cigarette?

01:11:19.763 --> 01:11:21.037
Fuck!

01:11:22.563 --> 01:11:25.475
Did you say fuck?
What are we waiting for?

01:11:41.003 --> 01:11:41.958
Sorry.

01:11:44.203 --> 01:11:47.036
We've exchanged bodily fluids
after all.

01:12:10.923 --> 01:12:12.242
I couldn't.

01:12:14.243 --> 01:12:18.953
I couldn't do it.
It's awful, but I couldn't do it.

01:12:19.523 --> 01:12:23.232
It would have to be him
I can't do it with.

01:12:27.163 --> 01:12:28.755
Because he's sick.

01:12:30.283 --> 01:12:33.241
How bloody sick is that?
- It isn't, Lynn.

01:12:33.443 --> 01:12:37.152
It is, because if I'm honest
I'd have done it hundreds of times.

01:12:40.883 --> 01:12:44.159
Thomas, I could keep him here.

01:12:44.483 --> 01:12:48.795
I could give him a reason to live,
by kissing him and loving him.

01:12:49.003 --> 01:12:50.721
And I don't do it.

01:12:54.603 --> 01:12:58.152
You give him all your love.
I see you do it every day.

01:12:58.363 --> 01:13:02.879
You give him... all your love.
- You don't get it, Thomas.

01:13:05.083 --> 01:13:06.801
You have to be able to...

01:13:09.083 --> 01:13:10.835
You have to be able to prove it.

01:13:16.083 --> 01:13:17.914
You have to be able to do it.

01:13:24.683 --> 01:13:26.435
You can only...

01:13:33.443 --> 01:13:35.832
You can only do it like this.

01:13:40.243 --> 01:13:44.839
You have to want all of someone,
including their saliva, their bacteria.

01:14:13.723 --> 01:14:14.758
Great.

01:14:15.363 --> 01:14:16.432
Fantastic.

01:14:16.643 --> 01:14:18.634
Right, I'm off.

01:14:21.163 --> 01:14:24.075
There are others waiting for
my hands of gold.

01:14:24.283 --> 01:14:26.956
Bye.
- Bye, Glen. Thanks.

01:14:28.723 --> 01:14:30.315
I've done something stupid.

01:14:31.043 --> 01:14:33.716
You, done something stupid?
What a surprise!

01:14:33.923 --> 01:14:35.879
Something really stupid.
- What?

01:14:36.883 --> 01:14:38.953
Lynn... I tried to...

01:14:40.083 --> 01:14:41.198
kiss her.

01:14:41.403 --> 01:14:44.201
Among other things. Stupid, eh?

01:14:44.883 --> 01:14:46.555
I didn't succeed.

01:14:46.763 --> 01:14:50.153
But I think she must feel guilty now.

01:14:50.363 --> 01:14:52.672
If I tell her not to feel guilty

01:14:52.883 --> 01:14:55.875
it's as if I'm saying
she should feel guilty.

01:14:56.363 --> 01:14:58.274
Dad.
- Milanovic.

01:15:00.283 --> 01:15:03.081
Dad.
- Watch out, son.

01:15:03.283 --> 01:15:04.955
How are things at school?
- Boring.

01:15:05.163 --> 01:15:06.232
Are they?

01:15:07.523 --> 01:15:12.119
It's supposed to be like that, eh?
Otherwise it wouldn't be school.

01:15:12.323 --> 01:15:17.477
How are you doing at school?
- I've failed everything.

01:15:20.323 --> 01:15:22.359
You will have to try harder, eh?

01:15:24.243 --> 01:15:25.642
Grandma.

01:15:28.203 --> 01:15:29.522
Come here, sweetheart.

01:15:29.723 --> 01:15:32.283
Look who's here.

01:15:33.483 --> 01:15:35.075
Hello, Milan.

01:15:36.363 --> 01:15:39.400
Did you manage to eat anything?
- A bit.

01:15:40.123 --> 01:15:44.036
How's he doing?
- How d'you think he's doing?

01:15:45.403 --> 01:15:47.997
He tells everyone
his dad is an explorer

01:15:48.203 --> 01:15:50.671
who may or may not come back.

01:15:52.643 --> 01:15:54.201
Did you tell him that twaddle?

01:15:55.763 --> 01:15:57.196
Be careful.

01:16:08.643 --> 01:16:12.522
Are you alright?
- Yeah. I have to be.

01:16:14.523 --> 01:16:15.478
Yeah...

01:16:16.203 --> 01:16:18.034
How is something like that done?

01:16:19.123 --> 01:16:21.273
Is it an injection?

01:16:22.603 --> 01:16:25.959
Do you really want to know?
- Yes.

01:16:27.003 --> 01:16:29.119
If one day the time has come...

01:16:31.523 --> 01:16:34.515
I have to plan ahead, Thomas.
For him too.

01:16:40.203 --> 01:16:42.273
It can be done with an injection

01:16:43.003 --> 01:16:47.474
or something they drink,
usually barbiturates.

01:16:49.163 --> 01:16:56.160
Then they sink slowly into a coma,
like they're falling asleep.

01:16:57.883 --> 01:17:02.115
And they're given something at the end
to stop their heart.

01:17:10.963 --> 01:17:13.921
Ah, Schubert. Hear that?

01:17:15.043 --> 01:17:17.921
That's drama in musical form.

01:17:18.123 --> 01:17:21.752
All the stories in this music

01:17:21.963 --> 01:17:25.512
can only be told with this music.
Can you hear that?

01:17:26.363 --> 01:17:27.398
No.

01:17:27.603 --> 01:17:30.356
I still can't hear it.
- You still can't?

01:17:30.843 --> 01:17:33.232
He never finished his eighth symphony.

01:17:33.443 --> 01:17:35.479
It's strange, no one knows why.

01:17:35.683 --> 01:17:39.676
It lay there for years and then he died.

01:17:39.883 --> 01:17:42.192
Quite young, in fact.

01:17:44.603 --> 01:17:49.358
Aren't you scared... of... of dying?

01:17:52.163 --> 01:17:54.358
No, I'm not scared of dying. No.

01:17:54.563 --> 01:17:59.193
Well... No, not really.
It's strange, but I'm not.

01:18:00.683 --> 01:18:03.641
In the whole of my life
I've only been scared of one thing.

01:18:04.203 --> 01:18:06.512
That something would happen to you.

01:18:08.283 --> 01:18:13.482
But it won't, eh? You're going
to be just fine, aren't you?

01:18:16.083 --> 01:18:18.677
You're only half a symphony too,

01:18:19.723 --> 01:18:22.635
but you're going to have to
write the second half yourself.

01:18:23.443 --> 01:18:25.035
I'm just sorry...

01:18:29.763 --> 01:18:30.718
Silly.

01:18:30.923 --> 01:18:32.675
...that I won't hear it.

01:18:36.443 --> 01:18:38.354
Can you hear it now?

01:18:40.323 --> 01:18:42.359
No.
- Just say yes.

01:18:42.563 --> 01:18:43.518
Yes.

01:18:59.203 --> 01:19:00.795
<i>Amid international interest,</i>

01:19:01.003 --> 01:19:06.680
<i>the bill legalising euthanasia was</i>
<i>passed in the Lower Chamber today.</i>

01:19:06.883 --> 01:19:11.274
<i>That means patients whose suffering</i>
<i>has become unbearable</i>

01:19:11.483 --> 01:19:16.796
<i>can now ask a doctor to end their life.</i>

01:19:17.003 --> 01:19:22.396
<i>51 voted against it</i>
<i>and 86 voted in favour.</i>

01:19:22.643 --> 01:19:24.315
<i>The Lower Chamber passes the law.</i>

01:19:24.523 --> 01:19:29.199
<i>Apart from the Netherlands, Belgium is</i>
<i>the only country to legalise euthanasia.</i>

01:19:29.403 --> 01:19:32.918
<i>But it is noticeable that</i>
<i>no one applauded the new law.</i>

01:19:33.123 --> 01:19:38.356
<i>For Mario Verstraete, the MS patient who</i>
<i>has become the public face of this law,</i>

01:19:38.563 --> 01:19:43.683
<i>this is a victory but possibly</i>
<i>also a defeat because, Mr Verstraete,</i>

01:19:43.883 --> 01:19:48.195
<i>it could also be the announcement</i>
<i>of your imminent... decision?</i>

01:19:48.403 --> 01:19:50.758
<i>Listen, I see it like this.</i>

01:19:51.403 --> 01:19:53.519
I'm going to die at 40.

01:19:54.483 --> 01:19:58.192
That's young today but in olden times
that was a ripe old age.

01:19:59.003 --> 01:20:02.075
Soon people may live to 150

01:20:02.283 --> 01:20:05.912
and 75 will seem very young.

01:20:06.123 --> 01:20:09.752
I'm not interested in
how long someone lives,

01:20:09.963 --> 01:20:13.876
just in how.
I've had a fantastic life.

01:20:15.243 --> 01:20:16.153
<i>Mr Verstraete?</i>

01:20:16.363 --> 01:20:19.082
Darling? Darling? You poor thing.

01:20:19.363 --> 01:20:22.196
Are you OK?
- Yes, yes, I'm alright.

01:20:22.403 --> 01:20:23.392
Dad?

01:20:23.883 --> 01:20:26.078
I dropped it.

01:20:33.203 --> 01:20:34.761
It's OK. It's OK.

01:20:34.963 --> 01:20:37.113
We can...
- Leave it, Lynn.

01:20:37.323 --> 01:20:42.636
Leave it, darling. It's OK. It's OK.

01:20:44.763 --> 01:20:46.037
It'll be fine.

01:20:50.483 --> 01:20:54.601
I think we should follow
the correct procedure.

01:20:55.163 --> 01:20:57.631
Let's go round the table.

01:20:58.283 --> 01:20:59.557
Olivier?

01:21:02.163 --> 01:21:04.199
We've discussed it for a long time.

01:21:05.403 --> 01:21:11.842
Usually I'm the first to tell
MS patients they mustn't give up.

01:21:12.443 --> 01:21:13.876
They mustn't panic.

01:21:14.083 --> 01:21:16.995
But in 5% of the cases we are dealing
with this kind of illness,

01:21:17.203 --> 01:21:20.513
which attacks you from inside,
as it were.

01:21:21.763 --> 01:21:23.674
You can carry on living with it.

01:21:24.723 --> 01:21:26.634
But if you don't want to...

01:21:29.643 --> 01:21:31.440
That's why I'm going to...

01:21:32.203 --> 01:21:35.832
Mario is mainly worried about
the damage to his brain

01:21:36.043 --> 01:21:40.719
and what may possibly happen:
total blindness, inability to speak,

01:21:40.923 --> 01:21:44.393
loss of memory and social skills...

01:21:44.603 --> 01:21:50.041
It's not certain it will all happen but
I understand what Mario is afraid of.

01:21:58.083 --> 01:22:00.802
We won't turn it into
a long, drawn-out funeral.

01:22:02.163 --> 01:22:06.998
Here, 30 September. An excellent day.

01:22:07.203 --> 01:22:12.516
Indian summer. <i>Hoka Hey,</i>
as the Lakota Indians used to say.

01:22:12.723 --> 01:22:17.001
An excellent day to die.
30 September.

01:22:25.923 --> 01:22:26.878
Hold on.

01:22:27.723 --> 01:22:28.872
Hold on.

01:22:32.363 --> 01:22:36.242
It's not because you can do it
that you have to do it, Mario.

01:22:36.443 --> 01:22:40.277
You've got plenty of time. Eh?

01:22:41.003 --> 01:22:44.916
Why rush it? You've got time.

01:22:45.123 --> 01:22:46.920
You've got time.

01:22:51.203 --> 01:22:52.795
I've lived a sloppy life.

01:22:53.683 --> 01:22:57.961
And I don't want a sloppy death.

01:22:58.163 --> 01:23:02.600
Don't begrudge me that.
Let me at least get one thing right.

01:23:02.803 --> 01:23:04.282
Do it with style.

01:23:05.483 --> 01:23:09.442
I understand. I understand your fears.
But why so soon?

01:23:09.643 --> 01:23:12.077
I shouldn't have asked you.

01:23:12.883 --> 01:23:14.157
Sorry.

01:23:15.563 --> 01:23:16.996
We'll do it without you.

01:23:21.603 --> 01:23:23.036
30 September.

01:23:55.523 --> 01:23:56.478
Mum.

01:24:04.083 --> 01:24:09.635
I'm sorry... sorry, Mum.
- One day you'll learn to be quiet...

01:24:09.843 --> 01:24:11.720
For all the trouble.

01:24:12.883 --> 01:24:17.320
Things like that
make you know you're alive.

01:24:20.163 --> 01:24:25.191
Yes, but... it's not right.
- Be quiet, son.

01:24:25.923 --> 01:24:31.839
When you bring a child into this world,
you know it will leave it one day too.

01:24:32.043 --> 01:24:33.317
That's the way it is.

01:24:41.683 --> 01:24:43.753
Just look at me sitting here.

01:24:48.283 --> 01:24:50.001
39...

01:24:50.843 --> 01:24:53.038
I'm 39 years old...

01:24:53.803 --> 01:24:55.600
and I'm a baby again.

01:24:56.923 --> 01:24:59.391
There aren't many who are that lucky.

01:25:09.403 --> 01:25:10.677
Sorry, Mum.

01:25:11.363 --> 01:25:12.478
It's OK.

01:25:18.563 --> 01:25:19.757
It's OK.

01:25:42.363 --> 01:25:43.955
Your Worship.

01:25:47.083 --> 01:25:49.074
Can I hold it for a moment?

01:25:59.603 --> 01:26:01.195
How are you going to feel?

01:26:05.403 --> 01:26:08.201
Dad says I mustn't be too sad.

01:26:10.123 --> 01:26:11.875
But I'm not going to listen to him.

01:26:16.123 --> 01:26:19.081
And then, after that,
I'll probably feel less and less sad.

01:26:22.123 --> 01:26:23.715
And then...

01:26:25.923 --> 01:26:27.720
I'm going to miss him, of course.

01:26:32.283 --> 01:26:33.636
But...

01:26:33.843 --> 01:26:36.073
I already spend most of my time with Mum

01:26:36.283 --> 01:26:40.515
and when I'm not with Dad,
he's still my dad.

01:26:40.723 --> 01:26:44.113
So when Dad isn't there at all any more,

01:26:44.963 --> 01:26:46.362
not even at the weekend,

01:26:46.563 --> 01:26:49.635
he'll still be my dad.

01:26:57.843 --> 01:27:03.634
Is it true that Dad, Speck and you
fought the American army?

01:27:04.083 --> 01:27:05.198
Yes.

01:27:05.403 --> 01:27:08.201
Your dad stopped the Cold War
all on his own.

01:27:08.403 --> 01:27:09.756
The Cold War?

01:27:09.963 --> 01:27:13.512
Or at least, warmed it up quite a bit.

01:27:29.403 --> 01:27:31.519
Here we go.

01:27:32.563 --> 01:27:35.236
Thomas? What have you got with you?

01:27:35.923 --> 01:27:40.553
What I've got with me, pal,
are the best things in the world.

01:27:41.283 --> 01:27:43.751
What a coincidence,
that is my final wish.

01:27:44.003 --> 01:27:45.800
Then today's your lucky day.
- Yeah.

01:27:53.483 --> 01:27:56.873
Like Socrates said
before drinking the poison...

01:27:57.083 --> 01:27:59.916
I don't like that.
Haven't you got anything else?

01:28:00.883 --> 01:28:02.521
Now we go our separate ways.

01:28:03.243 --> 01:28:06.315
I to die, you to live.

01:28:06.523 --> 01:28:10.232
Which is better God only knows.

01:28:13.523 --> 01:28:15.479
That's what Socrates said.

01:28:15.683 --> 01:28:18.914
It could be that
you come back as a sexy chick.

01:28:19.603 --> 01:28:21.195
Could be...

01:28:26.723 --> 01:28:28.042
Thank you.

01:28:42.883 --> 01:28:46.558
Come on! Hey!
- I didn't do anything.

01:28:46.763 --> 01:28:49.835
It's true. What did you say?

01:28:50.243 --> 01:28:52.234
Pardon?
- Pardon?

01:28:55.083 --> 01:28:57.961
It's not...
It's not because of that fire...

01:28:58.163 --> 01:29:00.757
But you want to be cremated,
don't you?

01:29:00.963 --> 01:29:04.273
Yes, definitely. Go up in flames.

01:29:04.483 --> 01:29:07.475
But there's going to be a service.
- That'll do, stop it.

01:29:07.683 --> 01:29:11.835
I've already prepared everything.
It's in the bag.

01:29:12.083 --> 01:29:13.482
Or in the urn.

01:29:14.483 --> 01:29:17.953
I've arranged the ceremony,
chosen some music.

01:29:18.163 --> 01:29:20.552
Music to cry to, but still fantastic.

01:29:20.763 --> 01:29:22.481
I've also written a text.

01:29:23.043 --> 01:29:25.841
I'm going to make a speech.
- Are you?

01:29:26.043 --> 01:29:29.080
A great speech.
I'm already thinking about it.

01:29:29.283 --> 01:29:31.956
Deeply philosophical.
- Deeply philosophical...

01:29:32.163 --> 01:29:35.951
But with a touch of humour.
From Speck's box of jokes.

01:29:36.163 --> 01:29:39.633
You'll be sorry you're not there.
- That'll do, Speck.

01:29:39.843 --> 01:29:43.631
I'm sorry now.
What will it be like when I'm dead?

01:29:43.963 --> 01:29:46.602
Maybe you can rehearse in advance.
- OK, we will.

01:29:46.803 --> 01:29:49.397
Then I can hear it.
- Stop it.

01:29:49.603 --> 01:29:51.559
I can correct things.
- You're all sick.

01:29:51.763 --> 01:29:56.473
He is sick, that's the problem.
- Go and cool down, Speck.

01:29:58.043 --> 01:30:00.034
D'you think I don't dare?
- Yes.

01:30:00.243 --> 01:30:03.360
You don't dare.
- Let's do it then.

01:30:03.763 --> 01:30:06.641
Come on then. At my old age!

01:30:07.523 --> 01:30:09.878
Watch out.
- Come on, pal. You're going in.

01:30:10.083 --> 01:30:12.233
No, you're going in.
- No, you are.

01:30:13.803 --> 01:30:15.077
OK?

01:30:16.843 --> 01:30:18.196
Yeah.

01:30:18.403 --> 01:30:21.759
Make sure you're warm enough,
Crazy Horse.

01:30:23.003 --> 01:30:25.801
Unless you want to go for a swim.
- No.

01:30:26.363 --> 01:30:31.312
I'd rather stay here with you.
- And me with you.

01:30:33.883 --> 01:30:38.673
I'm going to have to miss you for a
long time. You won't have that problem.

01:30:38.883 --> 01:30:42.876
I've missed you all my life.

01:30:44.363 --> 01:30:46.160
That's too cold!
- You're going in.

01:30:46.363 --> 01:30:48.354
No, no.
- You're going in.

01:30:50.203 --> 01:30:53.593
There's something horrible in there.
An eel or a crayfish.

01:30:54.003 --> 01:30:57.678
It's too cold.
Not doing something is cool too.

01:30:57.883 --> 01:30:59.953
I'm going to warm it up first. OK?

01:31:00.603 --> 01:31:02.161
I'm not going in there then.

01:31:02.923 --> 01:31:07.474
With regard to the best things in
the world, I've brought something too.

01:31:08.363 --> 01:31:10.115
But you have to shut your eyes.

01:31:11.563 --> 01:31:12.552
OK.

01:32:16.203 --> 01:32:18.239
Richard Strauss.

01:32:20.683 --> 01:32:22.958
The best music in the world.

01:32:26.883 --> 01:32:28.077
I'm tired.

01:33:28.963 --> 01:33:30.715
Hello, Dad.

01:33:32.803 --> 01:33:34.122
Good morning, Mario.

01:33:38.923 --> 01:33:40.322
Did you sleep well?

01:33:41.683 --> 01:33:42.911
No.

01:33:43.203 --> 01:33:45.671
Neither did I. I was too hot.

01:33:47.403 --> 01:33:49.155
Will you be OK? Will you manage?

01:33:50.803 --> 01:33:52.953
You know what my father always said.

01:33:53.643 --> 01:33:56.157
Don't complain, just get on with it.

01:33:56.883 --> 01:33:59.272
And pray for strength.

01:34:00.443 --> 01:34:02.081
You, pray?

01:34:04.883 --> 01:34:07.078
Do you know the story of Simeon?

01:34:08.643 --> 01:34:10.474
Get that book there.

01:34:11.403 --> 01:34:15.191
That beige one. There.
The one on Rembrandt.

01:34:16.443 --> 01:34:18.001
It's on the cover.

01:34:18.203 --> 01:34:25.757
Simeon, the old man who wouldn't die
until he'd seen the Messiah.

01:34:27.003 --> 01:34:28.561
It's a beautiful painting.

01:34:30.083 --> 01:34:33.678
Simeon finally saw Jesus in a temple.

01:34:33.883 --> 01:34:36.795
He held Baby Jesus in his arms,
looked up to heaven,

01:34:37.323 --> 01:34:40.554
blissfully happy,
to ensure God kept His promise.

01:34:40.763 --> 01:34:42.674
Absolutely blissfully happy.

01:34:42.883 --> 01:34:46.592
Because he is finally allowed to die.
It's allowed, even in the Bible.

01:34:46.803 --> 01:34:47.792
Even there...

01:34:50.523 --> 01:34:55.756
Yeah... But he's an old man, Mario,
and you are a young colt.

01:34:56.563 --> 01:34:59.555
Have you seen me
galloping around much lately?

01:35:01.123 --> 01:35:05.116
Dad, you believe...
you believe in paradise.

01:35:05.323 --> 01:35:07.632
And everything being fine in the end.

01:35:07.843 --> 01:35:11.438
That we're all going to eat
rice pudding off gold spoons.

01:35:11.643 --> 01:35:12.837
Be happy...

01:35:14.003 --> 01:35:15.197
Dad.

01:35:15.683 --> 01:35:16.911
For me.

01:35:18.963 --> 01:35:22.239
Have you already seen the Messiah?
You haven't, eh?

01:35:23.163 --> 01:35:24.676
Haven't I?

01:35:26.283 --> 01:35:28.433
Watch out. Be careful.
- Come here, son.

01:35:32.683 --> 01:35:33.798
Sleep well?

01:35:35.203 --> 01:35:36.477
No...

01:35:37.003 --> 01:35:38.482
We didn't either.

01:35:42.443 --> 01:35:49.633
The president of the United States,
George W. Bush, declared last night

01:35:49.843 --> 01:35:55.361
that if the UN's Security Council
doesn't do anything about Iraq,

01:35:55.563 --> 01:36:00.273
the United States and
a number of their friends will do so.

01:36:00.483 --> 01:36:05.796
He's asking Congress
for their support. Bush...

01:36:06.003 --> 01:36:08.881
Thomas Dhondt.
Yes, just a minute, I'll go outside.

01:36:10.323 --> 01:36:13.281
When? When had you thought to do it?

01:36:13.843 --> 01:36:15.071
Yes.

01:36:15.563 --> 01:36:16.757
OK, goodbye.

01:36:18.323 --> 01:36:22.032
Here, Chinese throwaway. A different pong
in the car for a change.

01:36:22.243 --> 01:36:25.679
Will you be OK, brother?
- It's one journalist after another.

01:36:26.323 --> 01:36:31.317
Someone from <i>La DerniÃ¨re Heure</i>
phoned just now. Symbolic, eh?

01:36:31.523 --> 01:36:34.435
To ask if we don't know anyone
who can stop him.

01:36:34.643 --> 01:36:38.033
And national TV asked if they can
broadcast their interview tonight.

01:36:41.363 --> 01:36:42.557
It's not a sports car.

01:36:42.763 --> 01:36:45.641
Honestly. Chinese...

01:36:45.843 --> 01:36:49.722
Come on, let's put it on a nice tray.

01:36:49.923 --> 01:36:51.515
The Last Supper.

01:36:52.363 --> 01:36:55.241
Ah, <i>Malio.</i>
- A <i>thirty-thlee</i> for me.

01:36:55.443 --> 01:36:57.274
With <i>plawn clackers?</i>
<i>- Andminelal water.</i>

01:36:57.483 --> 01:36:59.439
<i>Minelal water, natulally.</i>

01:36:59.643 --> 01:37:02.441
Give him my <i>legards.</i>
- I will.

01:37:12.963 --> 01:37:14.681
An angel flying past.

01:37:17.203 --> 01:37:19.671
That's what they say
when there's a silence, eh?

01:37:21.443 --> 01:37:23.240
Yes, that's true.

01:37:25.283 --> 01:37:29.515
I had quite a lot I wanted to say
but I've forgotten what it was.

01:37:33.483 --> 01:37:34.836
Ummm...

01:37:36.523 --> 01:37:39.083
I'd like to do my speech now.

01:37:40.323 --> 01:37:41.756
If I may.

01:37:43.323 --> 01:37:44.802
Everyone is here, so...

01:37:45.483 --> 01:37:48.873
I think this is a good time.

01:37:54.603 --> 01:37:55.752
Dear friends.

01:37:56.843 --> 01:38:02.679
I thought that was a nice beginning. And
it's true, so you can take it literally.

01:38:03.963 --> 01:38:07.000
As everyone knows,
I studied philosophy.

01:38:07.203 --> 01:38:13.358
So if anyone should be able to talk
about life and death, I should.

01:38:14.203 --> 01:38:15.192
But...

01:38:18.243 --> 01:38:21.553
Some English, to make it sound good.

01:38:26.483 --> 01:38:32.638
I don't know anything, except
what I learnt from you, Mario.

01:38:33.443 --> 01:38:40.201
You squeezed more stupidity, wisdom
and pleasure into forty years

01:38:40.403 --> 01:38:42.712
than others do into 140 years.

01:38:45.123 --> 01:38:46.841
It's simple.

01:38:47.043 --> 01:38:49.557
We die because we live

01:38:50.203 --> 01:38:53.001
and because we die we have to really live.

01:38:55.323 --> 01:38:57.757
You fought for your life and your death.

01:38:59.763 --> 01:39:01.276
That's typical of you.

01:39:02.923 --> 01:39:05.073
Resigning...

01:39:06.123 --> 01:39:08.034
before you are fired.

01:39:10.003 --> 01:39:12.563
You've even pulled a fast one on death.

01:39:14.483 --> 01:39:16.917
Actually, I don't feel
that sorry for you,

01:39:18.963 --> 01:39:20.521
but I do for myself.

01:39:22.323 --> 01:39:25.156
Or rather, it's for all of us here...

01:39:27.003 --> 01:39:28.482
that I feel sorry.

01:39:31.883 --> 01:39:37.992
Your dad taught me
lots of great things, Milan.

01:39:38.203 --> 01:39:41.479
I've had so much fun with you.

01:39:41.683 --> 01:39:47.280
That's why I am going to be so sad.
It's going to be a real problem.

01:39:47.483 --> 01:39:51.715
But here's an interesting
philosophical dilemma:

01:39:51.923 --> 01:39:57.316
if this is an amputation,
would we rather not have had an arm?

01:39:57.523 --> 01:40:01.562
If we're going to hurt so much, would we
rather not've had so much fun with you?

01:40:02.003 --> 01:40:03.834
Not me, anyway.

01:40:05.963 --> 01:40:07.999
In fact, I reckon none of us here.

01:40:10.803 --> 01:40:13.795
No one would have wanted to
have missed out on a single moment.

01:40:14.763 --> 01:40:16.674
Not even this moment.

01:40:16.883 --> 01:40:21.638
We're going to swear and grieve
because you are leaving.

01:40:21.843 --> 01:40:24.641
But we're going to celebrate
because you were here.

01:40:27.043 --> 01:40:29.796
So go to sleep, you're tired.

01:40:30.003 --> 01:40:35.361
The trees will still be there tomorrow,
but won't know how to stand up straight.

01:40:35.563 --> 01:40:38.202
The wind will still be there tomorrow,

01:40:38.403 --> 01:40:40.917
but won't know
in which direction to blow.

01:40:41.123 --> 01:40:43.683
And we will still be there too.

01:40:44.123 --> 01:40:47.479
And Milan will be there,
to become cleverer than you.

01:40:47.683 --> 01:40:49.753
Which isn't that difficult.

01:40:50.643 --> 01:40:55.319
And we're going to tell our Jef
all about you. All your exploits.

01:40:56.603 --> 01:40:59.595
And we're going to
stand up straight again.

01:40:59.803 --> 01:41:04.160
You could do it with your crutches,
so why wouldn't we be able to?

01:41:04.803 --> 01:41:07.522
We've enjoyed looking up
at the stars too much

01:41:07.723 --> 01:41:10.078
to be afraid of the night.

01:41:12.163 --> 01:41:16.634
We're going to learn to enjoy
the pain of missing you

01:41:18.923 --> 01:41:25.158
because this pain contains all our joy,
our gratitude for having known you.

01:41:25.363 --> 01:41:29.800
You won't be there any more,
but you will always be with us.

01:41:30.683 --> 01:41:33.117
And so I'm saying,
'Until always.'

01:41:33.323 --> 01:41:35.234
Thank you for everything, Mario.

01:41:41.523 --> 01:41:44.196
That was lovely. Lovely.

01:41:54.923 --> 01:41:57.676
There they are.
- Laurel and Hardy.

01:42:00.243 --> 01:42:02.359
That was a long time ago too.
- Yes.

01:42:03.363 --> 01:42:04.273
Milan.

01:42:25.043 --> 01:42:26.442
Hello.

01:42:39.043 --> 01:42:40.158
Hello everyone.

01:42:41.603 --> 01:42:42.638
Roger.

01:42:44.683 --> 01:42:46.355
Hello, doctor.

01:42:50.843 --> 01:42:53.755
Hello, Frank.
- Mario.

01:42:56.683 --> 01:42:57.798
Milan.

01:43:01.483 --> 01:43:02.518
OK?

01:43:03.483 --> 01:43:04.677
Yes.

01:43:06.483 --> 01:43:11.159
It's been a good day.
Not easy for anyone.

01:43:11.443 --> 01:43:13.195
No, I can imagine.

01:43:15.923 --> 01:43:22.362
Mario, I can just leave, if you like.
It's important you know that.

01:43:23.243 --> 01:43:28.237
And we can talk about it again later.
You can have many more good days.

01:43:30.723 --> 01:43:34.079
You should leave a good party
when it's in full swing.

01:43:35.243 --> 01:43:40.522
So, we'll... we'll do it.

01:43:50.483 --> 01:43:52.314
Four pharmacies.

01:43:54.243 --> 01:43:56.359
I had to go to four pharmacies.

01:43:57.523 --> 01:44:00.720
Everyone seems to know all about it.

01:44:02.163 --> 01:44:04.757
No one wanted to give it to you?

01:44:04.963 --> 01:44:09.593
The fourth pharmacist had seen her mum
suffer for three years. I got it there.

01:44:20.723 --> 01:44:24.079
Well...
Just a drink in a glass.

01:44:25.403 --> 01:44:26.631
Just a drink in a glass.

01:44:42.963 --> 01:44:46.319
Will you dream of me? And me of you?

01:44:47.563 --> 01:44:50.361
Of course. For a very long time.

01:44:54.283 --> 01:44:57.878
I'll have an early night tonight.
- Good idea.

01:44:58.083 --> 01:45:01.359
See you later.
- See you later.

01:45:05.603 --> 01:45:08.913
Bye, Dad.
- Bye, son.

01:45:12.363 --> 01:45:16.197
I'm so glad you were my dad.

01:45:16.403 --> 01:45:17.552
Me too.

01:45:18.603 --> 01:45:20.036
Me too.

01:45:21.243 --> 01:45:26.237
Be careful on your expedition.
- Yes, of course.

01:45:26.443 --> 01:45:31.153
And you be careful on your bike.

01:45:44.963 --> 01:45:47.113
Take good care of Mum, eh?

01:45:49.043 --> 01:45:53.082
And tell her that I always loved her.

01:47:04.683 --> 01:47:07.322
I'm so tired. So tired.

01:47:11.043 --> 01:47:12.681
Fancy a drink?

01:47:18.003 --> 01:47:19.231
Yes, could do.

01:47:24.083 --> 01:47:28.713
Don't forget.
Drink it all in one go. OK?

01:47:39.203 --> 01:47:40.272
Thank you.

01:47:42.523 --> 01:47:44.036
Thanks, mate.

01:47:46.283 --> 01:47:47.477
No, thank you.

01:47:52.323 --> 01:47:53.642
For an awful lot.

01:48:18.203 --> 01:48:20.319
I don't know what to say.

01:48:25.883 --> 01:48:29.353
You think of something.
Make something up.

01:48:31.243 --> 01:48:33.359
Something good, eh?

01:48:38.443 --> 01:48:39.637
Chin up, Dad.

01:52:20.603 --> 01:52:24.915
FOR MARIO AND
HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS

01:52:25.443 --> 01:52:28.321
THE EUTHANASIA LAW WAS PASSED
IN BELGIUM ON 28 MAY 2002.

01:52:28.723 --> 01:52:33.080
MARIO VERSTRAETE WAS
THE FIRST PERSON

01:52:33.283 --> 01:52:39.074
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LAW
HE HAD FOUGHT FOR FOR YEARS.
