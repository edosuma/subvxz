YUCK, A CHICKEN BONE.

21:43.902 --> 21:46.004
AYE, THANK YOU, KIND LAD.

21:46.071 --> 21:49.174
THAT THING'S BEEN STUCK
IN ME THROAT FOR AGES.

21:49.241 --> 21:52.544
YOU MEAN ALL THIS TIME YOU'VE
JUST BEEN CHOKING ON SOMETHING?

21:52.611 --> 21:57.749
{\an5}I'VE BEEN ASKING FOR HELP FOR
YEARS, LADDIE, BUT THAT STUPID
BIRD KEPT TRANSLATING WRONG.

21:57.816 --> 22:00.619
IT WAS HIM THAT WANTED
YOUR GOLD, NOT ME.

22:00.686 --> 22:02.521
[SQUAWK] AND I'M GONNA
GET IT, TOO.

22:02.587 --> 22:04.056
NOT ON MY WATCH.

22:04.122 --> 22:06.358
BOOTY POWERS ACTIVATE.

22:09.961 --> 22:12.564
I'LL SETTLE FOR SEATS
BEHIND HOME PLATE.

22:12.631 --> 22:17.035
{\an5}I'M AFRAID I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY
FOR THOSE BRUTES
RUNNING AMOK IN YOUR TOWN.

22:17.102 --> 22:19.071
I NEVER EVEN WANTED TO BE
A PIRATE.

22:19.137 --> 22:21.440
NO, I WANTED TO BE A CHEF.

22:21.506 --> 22:25.177
{\an5}BUT ONCE THAT BONE
GOT STUCK IN ME THROAT
AND I UTTERED ME FIRST "ARR"

22:25.243 --> 22:28.046
{\an3}ME DEAR OLD MUM SENT ME OFF
TO PIRATE SCHOOL.

22:28.113 --> 22:33.118
{\an3}I GUESS MY DREAM OF SERVING FOOD
WILL... WILL NEVER COME TRUE.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.220
ACTUALLY, MAYBE IT CAN.

22:35.287 --> 22:39.758
{\an5}COSMO, WANDA, NOW THAT
YOU'VE GOT YOUR WANDS BACK,
IT'S TIME TO MAKE SOME WISHES.

22:46.631 --> 22:51.069
{\an6}COOL, WE SAVED THE TOWN
FROM PIRATES, GOT OURSELVES
AWESOME SEATS...

22:51.136 --> 22:54.339
PIRATE DOGS,
GET YOUR PIRATE DOGS HERE.

22:54.406 --> 22:56.775
{\an1}AND GOT DIRTYBEARD
HIS DREAM JOB.

22:56.842 --> 23:00.846
THREE HOT DOGS, PLEASE.

23:00.912 --> 23:03.915
Godparents: EW.

23:03.982 --> 23:08.053
[SCREAMING]

23:08.120 --> 23:10.422
I THINK I JUST LAID ANOTHER EGG.

23:10.489 --> 23:12.324
YOU'RE NOT AN OSTRICH ANYMORE.

23:12.390 --> 23:15.861
YEAH, I KNOW.

23:15.927 --> 23:17.763
Man: EAT THIS!

23:20.999 --> 23:24.469
[♪...]
