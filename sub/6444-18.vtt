WEBVTT

00:01.080 --> 00:03.116
Yes, Martha, I finished the proposal.

00:03.280 --> 00:06.352
And I finished all the charts for
your committee meeting.

00:07.440 --> 00:10.955
Oh, clark's in the neighborhood?
Sure, he can come pick them up.

00:11.840 --> 00:13.637
Oh, don't even mention it.

00:13.800 --> 00:16.473
Okay. Bye, Martha.

00:16.640 --> 00:18.756
Maddie, what are you doing?

00:20.000 --> 00:23.595
It's time to eat dinner, sweetheart.
You can draw later.

00:25.560 --> 00:27.755
Maddie, you know the rules.

00:27.920 --> 00:29.638
Please get back to the table.

00:29.840 --> 00:32.354
I want us to eat as a family.

00:37.440 --> 00:41.638
Look, you might not wanna talk,
but you have to listen to me.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.432
Put your book away now.

00:44.040 --> 00:45.632
Maddie, give that to me.

00:46.600 --> 00:47.794
Maddie!

00:51.920 --> 00:53.114
What just happened?

00:57.400 --> 00:59.595
You did that, didn't you?

01:02.680 --> 01:05.638
All those times I've found
broken glass...

01:06.760 --> 01:08.910
<i>...they</i> weren't accidents.

01:11.160 --> 01:13.515
Nobody warned me about this.

01:13.680 --> 01:15.033
I think you need help.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.395
I'm calling the foster-care agency
right now.

01:20.600 --> 01:22.591
I can't take this anymore.

01:22.800 --> 01:23.835
No, don't touch me.

01:25.680 --> 01:28.513
Just, please, go to your room.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:59.640 --> 03:01.915
No!

03:58.360 --> 04:01.670
I found Naomi in the kitchen.
There was glass everywhere.

04:01.880 --> 04:04.952
What kind of person would commit
such a brutal crime?

04:05.120 --> 04:07.839
Whoever it was, the sound
of your truck scared them off.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.958
Well, thank you for letting her
stay with us tonight, deputy.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.076
After all she's been <i>through...</i>

04:13.280 --> 04:16.077
...there's no reason she should
spend the night in a shelter.

04:16.240 --> 04:19.437
No problem, senator. Child Services
will come by tomorrow to check in.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.158
Okay, good. Thank you.

04:24.720 --> 04:26.233
It makes no sense.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.834
All Naomi wanted to do was
help people.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.592
She was a foster parent.

04:30.760 --> 04:34.673
She ran a youth center before
she was my chief of staff.

04:36.280 --> 04:38.316
Maddie hasn't said a word
since she got here.

04:38.480 --> 04:42.678
Naomi told me she hasn't spoken
since she was 3 years old.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.748
That's when her birth mother
was killed.

04:46.880 --> 04:49.713
Can't blame her. She's been through
one tragedy after another.

04:49.880 --> 04:51.996
And countless foster homes.

04:52.520 --> 04:55.557
- I should call Lionel in London.
- Lionel?

04:55.760 --> 04:57.751
Naomi used to run
his children's foundation.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.353
I really should let him know.

04:59.560 --> 05:02.632
- Mom, maybe you should wait.
- No, no, it'll take a minute.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.315
Hey, Maddie, what you drawing?

05:18.240 --> 05:20.674
You're quite the artist, aren't you?

05:25.720 --> 05:28.075
You know, I'm an artist too.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.831
You don't believe me?

05:33.840 --> 05:36.957
All right, well, I'll just
have to prove it to you then.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.038
Now, prepare yourself...

05:44.200 --> 05:46.191
...because this is gonna be
a self-portrait.

05:46.360 --> 05:49.079
You might not be able to tell
the difference between this...

05:49.240 --> 05:51.276
...and an actual photograph.

06:03.240 --> 06:06.277
As long as we had to wade through
a sea of government paperwork...

06:06.440 --> 06:08.431
...at least we got to do it
over tuna rolls.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.795
Well, I'm not too fond of
working in the stacks.

06:10.960 --> 06:12.871
I have to admit,
I was pretty impressed...

06:13.040 --> 06:15.315
...you ordered the entire meal
in fluent Japanese.

06:15.480 --> 06:18.472
You could have warned me about
the squid brains though.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.675
Come on, you can't fool me.
You loved it.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.910
Lex, I was thinking, I don't really
feel comfortable hanging onto these.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.832
Some of these are marked "classified."

06:30.000 --> 06:32.878
You could get into a lot of trouble
even showing them to me.

06:33.040 --> 06:37.750
Lana, if Milton Fine is right about
an extraterrestrial threat...

06:37.920 --> 06:41.754
<i>...the</i> last thing the government's
gonna be worried about is Lana Lang.

06:42.360 --> 06:46.239
Besides, you're the only one who
knows of my transgression.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.391
I think I'm safe with
my fate in your hands.

06:50.880 --> 06:52.916
You must really trust me.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.591
Hundred percent.

06:57.120 --> 06:59.270
I hope you feel the same way
about me.

07:01.200 --> 07:02.997
I do.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.351
Sorry, I...

07:15.920 --> 07:18.957
I forgot my pencil in the library.

07:29.520 --> 07:33.035
And this is
the world-famous Kent barn.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.474
When I was about your age...

07:34.640 --> 07:37.632
...my dad used to let me
jump in the haystacks in here.

07:41.480 --> 07:43.436
Why don't you close your eyes,
turn around.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.318
I got a surprise for you.

07:46.880 --> 07:49.030
It'll be worth it, I promise.

08:03.320 --> 08:04.594
So, what do you think?

08:05.640 --> 08:07.471
You wanna give it a shot?

08:10.040 --> 08:12.713
Let me guess,
you're afraid of heights?

08:14.440 --> 08:16.590
I can relate.

08:17.960 --> 08:19.757
You know, Maddie...

08:21.040 --> 08:23.998
...you and I have a lot more
in common than you think.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.230
I was an orphan too.

08:46.200 --> 08:49.078
<i>Hey, boy. Good doggie.</i>

08:57.080 --> 08:59.389
Looks like Shelby likes you.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.709
Animals are great, aren't they?

09:09.280 --> 09:13.114
They listen to you,
don't say mean things back.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.150
Look, I might not be
as furry as Shelby...

09:17.960 --> 09:21.270
...or wag my tail or bark,
but I promise...

09:21.720 --> 09:23.472
<i>...I'll</i> never say mean things to you.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.436
What's up there?

09:40.720 --> 09:43.109
It's kind of like my clubhouse.

09:47.280 --> 09:49.714
Oh, you're so lucky.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.553
You can be lucky too, Maddie.
It's not too late.

09:52.720 --> 09:55.439
- We're gonna find you a good family.
- People don't like me.

09:55.600 --> 09:59.991
What? Well, those people are crazy.
I like you.

10:02.080 --> 10:04.275
Is this your girlfriend?

10:04.480 --> 10:11.079
Well, she used to be.
We kind of parted ways.

10:12.920 --> 10:15.992
Hey, you wanna go for a horseback ride?
Just you and me?

10:16.240 --> 10:17.229
Let's go.

10:17.840 --> 10:19.751
You can chat up Buttercup
all you want.

10:19.920 --> 10:23.151
- You have horses?
- So you can talk.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.598
I knew that whole Marcel Marceau thing
was just a rumor.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.512
I'm Lois.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.474
She's a little shy.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.997
I understand. A lot of artists are.

10:36.200 --> 10:39.078
I brought crayons and a coloring book.
Maddie, check it out.

10:40.520 --> 10:41.635
Go ahead.

10:44.080 --> 10:45.638
Your mom called from Topeka.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.598
With her chief of staff gone,
she's been in meetings all day.

10:48.760 --> 10:50.193
She asked if I could help out.

10:50.680 --> 10:52.398
I think we got it under control.

10:53.360 --> 10:56.670
I'm the one with the little sister,
remember?

10:56.840 --> 10:58.876
Okay, you ready for
a few games of hopscotch?

10:59.040 --> 11:02.430
I'm a bit rusty,
but you'll be the odds-on favorite.

11:02.600 --> 11:05.672
Actually, we were just about
to saddle up and hit the trails.

11:06.080 --> 11:08.833
Great. Bust out the spurs. I'm game.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.992
Oh, how adorable.
You wanna be alone with Clark.

11:15.160 --> 11:18.994
Hey, no worries. I will be galloping
way ahead of you guys.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.712
Maddie?

11:39.440 --> 11:41.237
Hey, what just happened out there?

11:49.520 --> 11:51.988
Did you break all those light bulbs?

11:56.320 --> 11:58.914
Listen, Maddie, I understand.

11:59.840 --> 12:04.595
You have powers, abilities that
normal people can't even dream of.

12:08.040 --> 12:09.917
And it's okay.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.836
You can trust me.
You can tell me the truth.

12:20.560 --> 12:23.916
Ever since I was little,
I could break glass.

12:24.080 --> 12:25.513
Yeah?

12:25.680 --> 12:29.036
And when I get upset,
I can't control it.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.598
Were you upset with Naomi?

12:36.400 --> 12:37.753
You think I killed her?

12:38.800 --> 12:40.995
Maddie, you have the power
to break glass.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.754
- And the way that she died...
- I didn't do it.

12:43.920 --> 12:47.799
Clark, I wasn't in the same room,
and I can't do anything through walls.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.629
I liked Naomi. I would never hurt her.

12:54.920 --> 12:57.753
Clark, can I talk to you
for a minute?

13:10.760 --> 13:13.991
I'm gonna call the sheriff now,
before we get sliced, diced and purÃ©ed.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.720
- Lois, I'm not sure she killed anybody.
- Oh, yeah?

13:16.880 --> 13:19.314
So someone else with
the power to shatter glass...

13:19.480 --> 13:20.708
...murdered her foster-mom?

13:20.880 --> 13:22.950
Having this ability
doesn't make her a killer.

13:23.240 --> 13:25.231
I always knew you were naive,
but come on.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.709
Don't let her rosy cheeks
and saucer eyes sway you.

13:27.880 --> 13:29.916
That girl's one step short of
the demon seed.

13:30.080 --> 13:32.310
Just give me an hour.
Then we'll call the police.

13:32.480 --> 13:35.040
Wait, you want me to babysit
that little glass-smasher?

13:35.200 --> 13:38.237
- Does my life mean nothing to you?
- I don't think she's dangerous.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.233
- Lf you're scared, I can call chloe.
- Who said I was scared?

13:41.400 --> 13:43.755
- I'm not scared.
- Great. Thanks.

13:58.640 --> 14:01.359
I took a peek into Maddie v an Horn's
Child Services files.

14:01.520 --> 14:05.274
I hate to break it to you, but there's
more than one reference to broken glass.

14:05.440 --> 14:08.830
I think Maddie's not just accident prone,
she's disaster prone.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.434
Yeah, well, that doesn't prove
she's a killer.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.670
If my parents hadn't
found me in that field...

14:13.840 --> 14:15.751
...it could have been me in
foster care...

14:15.920 --> 14:18.639
...scaring people,
being accused of crimes I didn't commit.

14:18.800 --> 14:22.190
Yeah, and one of your greatest powers
is your unrelenting faith in people.

14:22.360 --> 14:25.318
But I think when it comes to Maddie,
the jury's in.

14:25.920 --> 14:28.639
It wasn't just a car accident
that killed her mother...

14:28.800 --> 14:31.030
...it was a freak car accident.

14:31.200 --> 14:34.988
Witnesses saw the front windshield
mysteriously shatter before the crash.

14:35.160 --> 14:37.799
You think Maddie's responsible
for her own mother's death?

14:38.600 --> 14:42.115
Well, didn't she say she was having
a hard time controlling her powers?

14:48.360 --> 14:50.555
Whoever said you had to be
indoors to have fun?

14:50.720 --> 14:53.598
The best times I've ever had were
way out in the boonies...

14:53.760 --> 14:56.593
...as far away from breakables
as possible.

14:57.280 --> 15:00.158
- Where's Shelby?
- Oh, I have no idea.

15:00.320 --> 15:03.790
I'm allergic to him, and let's just say
he's not too fond of me.

15:04.360 --> 15:05.998
We're gonna have a good old time.

15:06.160 --> 15:11.029
We can pick flowers, or catch bugs.
Whatever floats your boat.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.158
I even packed that picnic for us.

15:13.320 --> 15:15.151
Granted, I'm the not
the greatest chef...

15:15.320 --> 15:17.197
...but how can you screw up PB&J?

15:17.400 --> 15:21.029
- Shelby?
- Hey, where you going?

15:22.600 --> 15:25.797
Shelby? Shelby?

15:25.960 --> 15:28.190
You can play with the pooch
when Clark gets back.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.078
Now, turn around and we can...

15:32.120 --> 15:33.872
Okay.

15:34.640 --> 15:38.235
Now, why don't we both just ease on
out of here before one of us gets hurt?

15:39.480 --> 15:41.311
Okay?

15:45.480 --> 15:47.675
What do you mean, "gets hurt"?

15:48.720 --> 15:50.995
- Who are you?
- Frank Colbert, Child Services.

15:51.160 --> 15:53.151
What's going on here?

15:54.240 --> 15:56.595
Okay, look,
I know this sounds crazy...

15:56.760 --> 15:59.752
<i>...but</i> I'm trying to keep her
as far away from glass as possible.

16:01.760 --> 16:04.593
Maddie, why don't you get in the car?

16:06.920 --> 16:09.878
No, no. Not the car.
You don't understand.

16:10.080 --> 16:13.629
I am telling you, this girl, she can
shatter glass just by looking at it.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.353
Thank you for your concern.

16:15.520 --> 16:17.750
Maddie, I'm gonna take you
back to the shelter...

16:17.920 --> 16:19.956
...where you can be properly
taken care of.

16:30.920 --> 16:35.914
<i>We spotted Milton Fine</i>
<i>at 0200 Greenwich Mean Time...</i>

16:36.080 --> 16:38.674
<i>... 40 kilometers north</i>
<i>of the Somalian border.</i>

16:43.960 --> 16:46.520
<i>Good news, Fine is in Myanmar.</i>

16:46.680 --> 16:49.956
<i>It's 0200 GMT,</i>
<i>and we're watching him as we speak.</i>

16:52.280 --> 16:53.872
Chloe.

16:56.120 --> 16:58.953
I know your moral compass has
a tendency to veer off course...

16:59.120 --> 17:01.759
...but taking advantage of Lana
at her most vulnerable...

17:01.920 --> 17:03.876
<i>...it's</i> despicable.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.993
I think your reporter's eye
is getting a little cloudy.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.275
You're starting to see things
that aren't there.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.790
I don't have to work for
the DWP to know...

17:12.960 --> 17:17.431
...there was enough electricity in that
room to light the entire state of Kansas.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.231
It's interesting how perceptive you are
about affairs of the heart...

17:21.400 --> 17:26.155
...considering you've never actually
been in a serious relationship.

17:27.760 --> 17:30.638
Do you really think Lana would be
remotely interested in you...

17:30.800 --> 17:33.314
<i>...if</i> she wasn't swept up
in her own emotional tornado?

17:33.480 --> 17:35.038
I mean, honestly.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.394
I appreciate you looking out
for your friend.

17:40.560 --> 17:44.473
I'd do the same.
But your concern is unwarranted.

17:44.760 --> 17:48.036
We're friends, nothing more.

17:49.680 --> 17:51.989
Lex, I know you're used
to getting what you want...

17:52.160 --> 17:55.835
...without even thinking about
the consequences, but I promise you...

17:56.280 --> 17:59.875
...if you hurt my friend,
there will be a consequence.

18:01.040 --> 18:02.519
And you're looking at her.

18:05.640 --> 18:07.312
Chloe.

18:09.280 --> 18:13.796
I think I'm getting an inkling
why you've never had a boyfriend.

18:31.800 --> 18:34.792
Trust me, for your own safety,
the girl can't be near glass.

18:34.960 --> 18:36.916
I heard you the first time.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.270
Will you get her belongings, please?

18:51.800 --> 18:53.631
Oh, God.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.078
Maddie, get out of the car!

19:24.320 --> 19:25.912
Hey!

19:27.520 --> 19:28.589
Stay there.

20:01.520 --> 20:03.670
Lois, are you okay?

20:03.840 --> 20:05.956
I've screwed up a lot,
but this ranks up there.

20:06.120 --> 20:07.792
That little girl was on my watch.

20:07.960 --> 20:09.598
There's nothing you could have done.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.990
I should've never left you two alone.

20:12.160 --> 20:13.752
Who's kidding who, Smallville?

20:13.920 --> 20:16.957
If you had been there,
you would have been shredded beef.

20:18.400 --> 20:21.073
Clark, she's gonna be fine.
They put out an AMBER Alert.

20:21.240 --> 20:23.276
Every cop in the state is
looking for Maddie.

20:24.760 --> 20:26.432
Did you get a good look at the guy?

20:27.440 --> 20:31.479
Like I told the sheriff,
mid-30s, sandy blond hair...

20:31.640 --> 20:33.915
...good-Iooking in that
psycho killer kind of way.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.151
I just don't understand who would
wanna kidnap Maddie.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.311
Considering her dangerous
disposition...

20:40.480 --> 20:43.631
<i>...I'm</i> guessing somebody who's
pretty desperate to be with her.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.315
Come on, Clark. Please, pick up.

20:52.480 --> 20:54.357
Pick up, Clark, please.

20:54.520 --> 20:57.830
Come on, Clark.
Clark, please, where are...?

20:59.080 --> 21:01.230
What are you doing, princess?

21:01.400 --> 21:02.958
Why are you running away from me?

21:06.560 --> 21:10.712
Look, look, I'm your dad.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.551
- I'm your dad.
- What?

21:16.200 --> 21:20.193
With all those years locked up,
you're the only thing that kept me going.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.271
I would do anything for you.

21:22.440 --> 21:23.714
You killed that man.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.155
- Look, I had no...
- You killed Naomi.

21:28.800 --> 21:30.438
You killed my real mom, didn't you?

21:30.600 --> 21:32.795
- Look...
- You did.

21:33.920 --> 21:37.469
Your mother didn't want me near you.

21:37.920 --> 21:40.070
She thought I was some monster.

21:40.280 --> 21:42.953
I swear all I wanted
was for us to be together.

21:44.280 --> 21:46.475
You like butterflies, don't you?

21:56.640 --> 21:58.392
I made this for you.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.071
It's okay.

22:08.080 --> 22:10.674
I know this is a big change.

22:12.640 --> 22:17.191
All I wanna do
is put our family back together.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.870
You belong to me. Now, come on.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.433
Come on.

22:29.600 --> 22:30.999
I've got a surprise for you.

22:44.600 --> 22:45.919
His name is Tyler McKnight...

22:46.080 --> 22:48.913
...and I think he might be
Maddie v an Horn's long-Iost father.

22:49.080 --> 22:50.229
What makes you say that?

22:50.400 --> 22:53.312
He was Maddie's mom's sweetheart
the year before she was born.

22:53.480 --> 22:54.754
But what does that prove?

22:54.920 --> 22:56.831
Twelve years ago
he landed in Belle Reve...

22:57.000 --> 22:59.673
...with the ability
to control all things glass.

22:59.840 --> 23:01.159
So he really is Maddie's dad.

23:01.320 --> 23:04.551
Which means that Maddie v an Horn's
meteor powers are second-generation.

23:06.280 --> 23:10.193
Her dad was in a stained-glass workshop
when the first meteor shower hit.

23:10.360 --> 23:13.432
So Maddie never met her father.
He's been locked up all her life.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.717
That's what happens when you
use your powers to rob a jewelry store.

23:16.880 --> 23:20.316
He got caught, the seven
five-carat diamonds he stole didn't.

23:20.680 --> 23:21.954
Did he just escape?

23:23.000 --> 23:25.309
He walked out.
He was a model patient.

23:25.480 --> 23:28.517
- Shrinks gave him a clean bill of health.
- We have to find Maddie.

23:28.680 --> 23:30.193
We don't know what this <i>guy's...</i>

23:30.360 --> 23:32.954
...capable of.
- We have no idea where he's headed.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.872
Where did he live
when he was arrested?

23:42.560 --> 23:44.278
With his mother.

23:44.920 --> 23:46.478
145 Hastings Road.

23:50.360 --> 23:53.432
I can't believe they let my son out.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.238
Why didn't he come and see me?

23:55.400 --> 23:57.311
Probably went straight
to see his daughter.

23:57.480 --> 23:59.630
Daughter?
Tyler doesn't have a daughter.

24:04.080 --> 24:06.150
Her name is Maddie,
and she's 11 years old.

24:07.760 --> 24:09.910
I have a granddaughter?

24:10.080 --> 24:14.198
Yes, ma'am, and it's very important
that we find her. She could be in danger.

24:18.240 --> 24:21.391
I've seen this before, at the Talon.

24:21.560 --> 24:23.232
Isn't it beautiful?

24:23.400 --> 24:25.834
He made it right before he was arrested.

24:26.040 --> 24:27.519
I don't have the finished piece.

24:27.680 --> 24:30.911
I had to sell it
after my husband passed away.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.479
Those seven diamonds he stole...

24:36.640 --> 24:37.959
...did they ever find them?

24:38.120 --> 24:39.519
No.

24:45.120 --> 24:49.238
I made this right before
they threw me into Belle Reve.

24:50.360 --> 24:53.158
But I always knew that I'd get out.

24:53.760 --> 24:55.318
We'd be together.

24:59.880 --> 25:01.552
Watch this.

25:24.640 --> 25:26.790
I hid these here for you, Maddie.

25:27.880 --> 25:29.199
For us.

25:31.880 --> 25:34.189
These are the start of our new life.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.234
Take them.

25:37.280 --> 25:38.599
Go on, take them.

25:40.880 --> 25:42.359
No.

25:43.840 --> 25:45.353
You stole them.

25:45.520 --> 25:47.431
- No, I didn't.
- You stole them.

25:47.800 --> 25:51.349
Please, take them.

25:54.040 --> 25:55.598
Let her go.

26:14.480 --> 26:15.959
Maddie?

26:17.480 --> 26:19.835
- It's okay.
- Clark.

26:21.720 --> 26:23.392
It's okay.

26:23.760 --> 26:25.432
It's okay.

26:25.640 --> 26:27.710
He'll never hurt anyone again.

26:35.040 --> 26:37.679
Thanks.
Hey, what are you doing here?

26:37.840 --> 26:40.559
I didn't think the <i>Daily Planet</i>
was on your weekend orbit.

26:40.720 --> 26:43.553
I just got a phone call from Lex.

26:45.920 --> 26:48.559
I don't understand, chloe.
Why didn't you just talk to me?

26:49.320 --> 26:51.436
Look, Lana, I'm sorry.

26:51.600 --> 26:54.592
After the last couple weeks
I didn't think you were <i>interested...</i>

26:54.760 --> 26:57.069
...in talking about your love life.
- My love life?

26:57.240 --> 27:00.710
- With Lex? You've gotta be kidding me.
- Lana, it's okay to be honest.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.518
I'm not gonna burn you at the stake.

27:02.680 --> 27:04.636
There is nothing
to be honest about, Chloe.

27:04.800 --> 27:07.678
So I'd appreciate it if you stopped
spinning your rumor mill...

27:07.840 --> 27:10.559
...before you humiliate me
any more than you already have.

27:12.160 --> 27:15.470
- I understand if you wanna hurt Clark.
- What?

27:15.680 --> 27:18.069
But just don't hurt yourself
in the process.

27:18.240 --> 27:21.038
Lex Luthor is nothing more
than a predator.

27:23.160 --> 27:26.550
Well, I don't plan on being
anybody's prey.

27:26.760 --> 27:28.432
So we have nothing to worry about.

27:39.080 --> 27:41.389
Now remember, the doctors
told you to take it easy.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.676
So you might have to lay off
the arm wrestling.

27:43.840 --> 27:45.592
My arm doesn't even hurt anymore.

27:45.760 --> 27:48.149
What hurts is knowing
how badly I treated that girl.

27:48.320 --> 27:50.356
I had no doubt
she was a cold-blooded killer.

27:50.720 --> 27:53.632
Goes to show you, people aren't
always who you think they are.

27:53.800 --> 27:55.552
I have to give you credit, Smallville.

27:55.720 --> 27:58.109
Who would've known
you'd be such a natural with kids?

27:58.280 --> 28:00.396
Well, Maddie's pretty special.

28:00.840 --> 28:02.432
So, what happens to her now?

28:02.600 --> 28:05.558
Can't be easy finding a family
willing to live without windows.

28:05.720 --> 28:08.518
She gonna live with her grandmother,
who couldn't be happier.

28:08.680 --> 28:10.716
She didn't even know
she had a granddaughter.

28:10.880 --> 28:12.677
Wow, she must be pretty brave.

28:13.240 --> 28:15.629
She's excited. Like my parents
when they adopted me.

28:15.800 --> 28:18.268
They didn't worry about
their house getting destroyed.

28:18.440 --> 28:20.431
Well, he had his moments.

28:20.600 --> 28:21.919
Hi, Clark.

28:22.080 --> 28:25.197
Since you're bedridden for a few days,
I brought you stuff to read.

28:25.360 --> 28:26.713
Thank you.

28:26.880 --> 28:30.714
The chief of staff for a state senator
needs to be fully informed on the issues.

28:31.600 --> 28:35.036
Wait a minute.
You want me to be your chief of staff?

28:35.240 --> 28:38.471
Mom, are you sure
you don't wanna think this through?

28:38.680 --> 28:41.592
If it weren't for Lois, your father
wouldn't have been elected.

28:41.760 --> 28:43.034
And I wouldn't be in office.

28:43.200 --> 28:44.792
Besides, Lois, it's pretty <i>clear...</i>

28:44.960 --> 28:47.599
...your destiny lies
far beyond a cappuccino maker.

28:47.760 --> 28:49.034
What do you think?

29:01.040 --> 29:03.918
Come on. Let's go.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.877
Nice glasses.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.479
Maddie?

29:38.960 --> 29:40.234
What you doing?

29:40.400 --> 29:42.834
Clark, you saved my life.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.798
- I just wanted to help out.
- Maddie?

29:46.600 --> 29:48.955
- Sweetie, you don't need to do that.
- Don't worry.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.111
I'm used to cleaning up after myself.

29:51.280 --> 29:52.918
Well, in this house, you're a guest.

29:53.080 --> 29:56.595
And guests always get a double helping
of Mom's banana pancakes.

29:58.800 --> 30:01.155
The way you are with her...

30:02.760 --> 30:05.069
Your dad would be so proud.

30:11.120 --> 30:13.714
Clark, did you ever meet
your real dad?

30:14.280 --> 30:16.032
Sort of.

30:16.200 --> 30:19.909
- Is he bad like mine?
- Maybe worse.

30:21.480 --> 30:25.268
But just because he gave me life
doesn't mean I'm anything like him.

30:27.120 --> 30:29.111
See, the thing is, Maddie...

30:29.960 --> 30:31.871
...anyone can be a father...

30:32.200 --> 30:34.430
...but it takes someone
very special to be a dad.

30:38.320 --> 30:40.390
I wish you could've met
the man who raised me.

30:40.920 --> 30:42.911
He was my real dad.

30:43.880 --> 30:45.154
He would've liked you a lot.

30:52.320 --> 30:55.517
Clark, could I stay here with you?

30:59.520 --> 31:01.397
Maddie, you have a grandmother.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.472
She's very excited
for you to come live with her.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.837
I don't know her.

31:07.680 --> 31:09.432
I know you.

31:10.760 --> 31:14.833
Well, Maddie, it's just you're gonna
have to give it time to get to know her.

31:15.400 --> 31:16.958
And...

31:19.040 --> 31:20.519
Maddie?

31:22.360 --> 31:24.157
Maddie, listen.

31:25.280 --> 31:27.919
Maddie, I would never
let you go with anyone...

31:28.080 --> 31:31.231
...who's not gonna accept you
for who you really are, okay?

31:32.280 --> 31:34.111
I promise.

31:42.720 --> 31:44.517
You're gonna be okay.

31:46.520 --> 31:49.114
I'll make sure. Okay?

32:00.360 --> 32:02.078
Hey, Mom?

32:02.240 --> 32:04.515
We need another deck of cards.

32:13.800 --> 32:15.791
Maddie, stay here.

32:20.840 --> 32:24.071
- Mom?
- Clark.

32:29.960 --> 32:31.757
You move a muscle...

32:34.200 --> 32:36.634
...your mom gets her throat slashed.

32:41.680 --> 32:43.557
Bring me my daughter.

32:44.200 --> 32:46.077
Bring me my daughter!

32:46.240 --> 32:47.593
Now!

33:11.920 --> 33:13.399
Don't worry, clark.

33:13.560 --> 33:15.471
I'm not gonna let him
hurt any more people.

33:15.960 --> 33:18.235
Maddie, no.

33:19.480 --> 33:22.278
Princess, what are you
doing to me? Don't.

33:22.480 --> 33:25.597
Maddie, if you kill him,
you'll be just like him.

33:25.760 --> 33:28.069
You don't have to turn into
your father.

33:29.160 --> 33:31.993
Maybe I don't have a choice.

33:33.920 --> 33:35.433
Just because you're his <i>child...</i>

33:35.600 --> 33:38.990
<i>...does</i> not mean that you're destined
to follow in his footsteps.

33:42.160 --> 33:45.675
But I don't want him
to hurt any more people.

33:47.080 --> 33:48.638
I won't.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.038
I promise.

33:54.560 --> 33:56.915
I made a mistake, Maddie.

33:57.480 --> 34:00.472
Your father has already
destroyed his life. Don't destroy yours.

34:00.640 --> 34:04.758
- Maddie, I promise, I won't...
- You have too much to offer this world.

34:15.639 --> 34:17.676
I'm sorry, clark.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.755
It's okay. It's over now.

34:40.760 --> 34:43.672
Go ahead, Maddie.
There's nothing to be scared about.

34:43.840 --> 34:45.273
Yes, there is.

34:45.480 --> 34:47.516
You won't be with me.

34:49.320 --> 34:53.154
- I'll have no one to talk to.
- That's not true.

34:54.600 --> 34:56.511
Your grandmother
can't wait to talk to you.

34:56.679 --> 34:59.433
She wants to hear
every word you have to say.

35:02.040 --> 35:04.156
What about my powers?

35:04.320 --> 35:05.719
What if I can't control them?

35:06.400 --> 35:08.391
But you can, Maddie.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.119
I've seen you.

35:10.320 --> 35:12.834
Just like you did
in the barn, remember?

35:15.360 --> 35:17.316
You ever feel
you're gonna lose <i>control...</i>

35:17.480 --> 35:19.755
...all you have to do
is pick up the phone.

35:19.920 --> 35:22.832
You call me, I'll be right there
to talk you through it, okay?

35:24.360 --> 35:26.510
I already miss you, Clark.

35:30.240 --> 35:31.673
I miss you too.

35:32.720 --> 35:36.190
Your grandmother's waiting for you.
She's gonna take good care of you.

35:37.920 --> 35:40.115
I almost forgot...

36:50.560 --> 36:51.834
So the good news is...

36:52.000 --> 36:56.391
<i>...with</i> Lois's love for gossip, I'll always
have inside scoop at the state capital.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.790
As long as she doesn't
get my mom impeached.

36:58.960 --> 37:02.475
Yeah, I think that Lois
is the least of your mom's worries.

37:02.640 --> 37:05.154
Have you told her about
your otherworldly suspicions...

37:05.320 --> 37:06.833
...that Lionel knows your secret?

37:07.000 --> 37:09.036
She's got a lot on her mind right now.

37:09.720 --> 37:11.631
Hey, how's Lana?

37:11.800 --> 37:14.360
Was wondering when you were
gonna bring up the L word.

37:14.520 --> 37:16.272
Why don't you call her?

37:16.440 --> 37:18.874
Actually, I was just trying
to give her some space.

37:20.560 --> 37:22.471
Has she met anyone yet?

37:24.240 --> 37:28.119
Clark, look, if you don't wanna
talk to her, that's fine. It's your choice.

37:28.280 --> 37:31.716
But please don't make me
your own personal little covert spy.

37:32.320 --> 37:33.958
Chloe?

37:35.760 --> 37:37.671
Is there something you're not telling me?

37:39.120 --> 37:40.553
No.

37:42.240 --> 37:43.878
Not at all.

38:14.080 --> 38:15.593
Lana.

38:16.480 --> 38:18.869
Thought you were busy
explicating Shakespeare today.

38:19.440 --> 38:20.793
I wanted to talk.

38:20.960 --> 38:23.110
Just to set the record straight.

38:25.040 --> 38:27.793
I don't think the record
could be any straighter.

38:27.960 --> 38:30.758
Chloe's working on a story
where there is none.

38:32.120 --> 38:33.872
Lex, our friendship means a lot to me.

38:34.040 --> 38:36.474
I don't want any misunderstandings
to get in the way.

38:36.640 --> 38:39.598
Lana, we're on the same page.

38:39.760 --> 38:43.309
If I somehow gave you the wrong
impression the other night, I apologize.

38:46.080 --> 38:50.471
You don't have to apologize
for something that didn't happen.

38:50.960 --> 38:53.269
Well, it wouldn't be the first time.

38:55.360 --> 38:59.797
This whole thing... I mean, I can't believe
we're even having this conversation.

38:59.960 --> 39:02.872
To think that there'd be anything
between us besides friendship?

39:03.040 --> 39:04.553
Don't worry.

39:04.720 --> 39:07.280
Talk is just a bunch of noise.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.271
As long as we both
feel the same way...

39:09.440 --> 39:11.476
That's all that matters.

39:28.240 --> 39:29.912
You okay?

39:33.680 --> 39:35.033
Look...

39:35.480 --> 39:38.040
<i>...it's</i> just something that happened.
