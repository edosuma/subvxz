KELSA: One of the reasons
I like animals so much

00:40.708 --> 00:43.836
is that they're all named
after what makes them unique.

00:43.919 --> 00:45.671
Here are some
of my favorites.

00:45.755 --> 00:49.133
And they should pop up
somewhere around here,

00:49.216 --> 00:50.134
I believe.

00:51.093 --> 00:52.970

or the BeyoncÃ© fly,

00:57.600 --> 00:59.268
and the blobfish.

00:59.351 --> 01:01.145
What makes them unique

01:01.228 --> 01:03.606
is also
what helps them survive.

use aposematic signals

If she likes something
from your closet,

02:41.996 --> 02:43.664

10:14.531 --> 10:16.616
(DOWNTEMPO MUSIC PLAYING)

10:24.875 --> 10:27.044
So, I, 25, female,

10:27.127 --> 10:31.298
met what seemed to be
the perfect guy, 26, male.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.800
But afterwards I tried texting

10:33.884 --> 10:36.470
and he totally ghosted.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.388
So,

10:38.472 --> 10:40.807
how do you get over
someone you never even dated?

KHAL: I don't think there's
any tried and true cure

10:49.608 --> 10:50.692

but one day,

10:59.576 --> 11:04.081

the pain will be gone.

this amazing girlfriend, 16F.

11:20.764 --> 11:23.266

to do it around her,

I don't know.
Sounds like some loser shit.

LARPing.

11:43.537 --> 11:44.538
Okay...

11:45.664 --> 11:47.916
I think the whole point
of having a partner

11:47.999 --> 11:50.460
is to be able
to be completely yourself

11:50.544 --> 11:51.795
around another person.

I need to lose weight.

once I'm on estrogen.

to take pills or shots.

really a personal thing,

15:48.281 --> 15:50.617
that just wouldn't
naturally come up.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.453
And I'm not even worried
about harassment

15:53.536 --> 15:55.246
or anything like that.

15:55.330 --> 15:57.957
I'm worried about people
only pretending to like me

15:58.041 --> 15:59.876
because they wanna be woke
or something.

16:00.835 --> 16:03.838
Like, once I'm off at college,
far away,

16:03.922 --> 16:07.175
and no one knows my tea,
I could go stealth.

nobody would know me.

for all that I am.

16:17.519 --> 16:21.398
the existential despair
of not being known

16:21.481 --> 16:24.192
or the existential despair

16:24.275 --> 16:29.155
of being known
and being rejected?

KHAL: My girlfriend got into
the college that she wanted

1:21:05.152 --> 1:21:08.114
because she's the greatest
mind of our generation.

1:21:08.197 --> 1:21:11.534
And the future's looking
pretty good for me too

1:21:11.617 --> 1:21:13.953

finally came around.

1:21:47.653 --> 1:21:49.071
We spent pretty much every day
of the summer together.

1:21:49.989 --> 1:21:50.906
Well, maybe not.

1:21:51.699 --> 1:21:52.783

1:22:37.453 --> 1:22:38.746
to give me back my computer.

1:22:39.246 --> 1:22:41.957

on the latest.

I've always been so focused
on how to just survive,

1:22:45.044 --> 1:22:48.297
but now I'm actually
thinking beyond that.

1:22:48.381 --> 1:22:50.549
I can be soft and flawed.

1:22:50.633 --> 1:22:52.259
I can make mistakes.

1:22:52.343 --> 1:22:54.011
I can let myself go and trust

1:22:54.095 --> 1:22:56.222
that people
will love me for me.

1:22:56.889 --> 1:22:58.766
I'm actually excited
about what's to come.

1:22:59.433 --> 1:23:00.935
For the first time in my life,

1:23:01.018 --> 1:23:03.938
I truly feel
anything's possible for me.

KHAL: Our summer together...

1:23:08.984 --> 1:23:10.194
was magical.

1:23:10.945 --> 1:23:13.656
But we both knew
what came next.

1:23:18.285 --> 1:23:22.123
Okay, so they're closing
in five minutes.

1:23:25.084 --> 1:23:26.794
We supposedly
came here to talk,

1:23:28.129 --> 1:23:29.672
so should we just do it?

1:23:31.090 --> 1:23:32.258

So, summer is ending soon.

1:23:47.064 --> 1:23:49.567

Yeah. Uh...

1:23:54.947 --> 1:23:56.866

happen with us?

Like, it would only be

1:24:15.593 --> 1:24:17.386

the other one's heart.

very, very complicated.

in my life,

1:24:39.867 --> 1:24:43.037
I can just exist
in this world.

1:24:44.538 --> 1:24:45.539
And...

1:24:47.666 --> 1:24:49.627
I know it's gonna be hard,

1:24:51.295 --> 1:24:54.298
but I don't want
to just exist.

1:24:56.467 --> 1:24:59.303
I need to find out
what else I'm capable of.

1:24:59.386 --> 1:25:00.930

Um, don't mind
the new background.

1:28:23.966 --> 1:28:26.593
I did move
into a college dorm,

1:28:26.677 --> 1:28:29.555

last year

1:28:42.359 --> 1:28:44.570
by someone I love.

1:28:44.653 --> 1:28:48.574

have the answer.

(BIRD CALLING)

1:28:52.453 --> 1:28:54.079
The marsh harrier
is a bird of prey

1:28:54.163 --> 1:28:57.833
that makes its home
over fields and reed beds.

1:28:57.916 --> 1:29:01.420
And it's known for its sharp
and precise hunting,

1:29:01.503 --> 1:29:04.048
as well as its daring
courtship displays.

1:29:04.673 --> 1:29:07.968
About two years
into their lifespan,

1:29:08.052 --> 1:29:11.221
some males will undergo
a metamorphosis

1:29:11.305 --> 1:29:13.474
which changes the color

1:29:13.557 --> 1:29:15.851
of some of their feathers
from a foggy gray

1:29:15.934 --> 1:29:18.979
to the creamy brown likeness
of the female.

1:29:19.063 --> 1:29:22.524
So, I like to say
my favorite animal

1:29:22.608 --> 1:29:24.443
is the marsh harrier

1:29:24.526 --> 1:29:30.032
because of its magnificent
and unique sky-dancing antics.

1:29:30.657 --> 1:29:33.535
But to myself, I can say,

1:29:33.619 --> 1:29:38.874
"Look at that beautiful,
