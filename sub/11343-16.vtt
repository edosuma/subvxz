'In the criminal justice system,

00:03.257 --> 00:06.727
'sexually based offences
are considered especially heinous.

00:06.777 --> 00:10.656
'In New York City, the detectives
who investigate these vicious felonies

Hello?

00:22.297 --> 00:24.686
Hey! You left the door open!

00:29.777 --> 00:32.052
Mrs Bernstein?

00:36.377 --> 00:38.652
Oh, my God!

00:40.697 --> 00:43.165
Mrs Bernstein?

00:56.897 --> 01:00.651
- Lot of chaos for one guy.
- Lady lived here for 50 years.

01:00.697 --> 01:03.086
- Alone?
- Alone.

01:11.497 --> 01:13.886
Guy ejaculated on her thigh.

01:13.937 --> 01:17.691
Look at this.
Tied up with her own support hose.

01:18.497 --> 01:21.887
The attacker came unprepared.
The rape was an afterthought.

01:21.937 --> 01:26.135
How do you get those thoughts about
somebody who's like your grandmother?

02:14.097 --> 02:15.894
Thanks a lot.

02:17.497 --> 02:21.456
- What are you doin' with a shrink?
- Doctor. Dr Skoda.

02:21.497 --> 02:24.250
- Skoda's a handful.
- He's the best.

02:24.297 --> 02:26.686
- In his mind.
- That's what he's best at.

02:26.737 --> 02:29.297
- That's double speak.
- What double speak?

02:29.337 --> 02:33.649
- Let's just wait to call him in.
- Too late for that. I invited him.

02:33.697 --> 02:37.372
Lenora Bernstein got up,
had tea and toast as she did every morning,

02:37.417 --> 02:40.215
then filled the bird feeder
outside her window.

02:40.257 --> 02:42.532
Then crawled back in bed to warm up.

02:42.577 --> 02:46.252
Some junkie came in through the window,
tied her up, gagged her.

02:46.297 --> 02:49.175
Robbed and raped her. An old lady.

02:49.217 --> 02:51.685
- How old is old?
- 72.

02:51.737 --> 02:54.968
- Who do we notify?
- She was a widow. Only son is dead.

02:55.017 --> 02:57.577
There's gotta be somebody.

02:57.617 --> 03:02.566
This is not an address book. It's the obits.
Funeral cards in every page.

03:02.617 --> 03:06.007
As if it weren't terrifying enough
facing old age alone.

03:06.057 --> 03:10.892
I do not get it. What kind of man
rapes a little old lady?

03:10.937 --> 03:16.057
Sexually inexperienced.
Late teens, early 20s. A social misfit.

03:16.097 --> 03:19.009
If he's been employed
it's intermittent, menial.

03:19.057 --> 03:21.491
- Projected mother rage?
- That would track.

03:21.537 --> 03:25.496
- His mother may have molested him.
- No disrespect to your training.

03:25.537 --> 03:28.415
But the perp can tell us
how he felt about his mother.

03:28.457 --> 03:32.928
You canvass her street.
Munch, Jeffries, see what the ME's got.

03:32.977 --> 03:35.616
An occlusion of the anterior descending

03:35.657 --> 03:39.093
- caused a myocardial infarction.
- Brought on by the rape?

03:39.137 --> 03:42.846
Or the sudden burst of adrenaline
from that kind of trauma.

03:42.897 --> 03:46.128
- That would do it.
- But it was natural causes.

03:46.177 --> 03:50.295
Induced during the commission of
a class-A felony. That's murder two.

03:50.337 --> 03:55.206
There's vulvar bruising, no internal
abrasions. Your guy was flustered.

03:55.257 --> 03:58.055
- Overly stimulated.
- Premature ejaculator.

03:58.097 --> 04:01.294
- Can we expedite the DNA?
- 50 bucks extra.

04:01.337 --> 04:06.286
Time of death was 10:53am. How long
before did the heart attack begin?

04:06.337 --> 04:11.365
I'll have to do a dissection
of the blood vessels. I'll let you know.

04:11.417 --> 04:14.853
Did she have anything especially valuable

04:14.897 --> 04:18.776
that somebody might've known about?
Jewellery, maybe.

04:18.817 --> 04:23.572
Oh, yeah. She had some gorgeous pieces.
Diamonds set in platinum.

04:23.617 --> 04:27.292
She'd wear
that kind of jewellery around here?

04:27.337 --> 04:31.376
- To temple, sure.
- Can you describe the pieces?

04:31.417 --> 04:33.977
Yeah, in one word. Sold.

04:34.017 --> 04:36.406
She had no choice.

04:36.457 --> 04:41.406
Her jewellery box was cleaned out.
Would there have been anything left?

04:41.457 --> 04:46.053
No, nothing. Well, maybe some
costume pieces that she'd pick up

04:46.097 --> 04:50.090
at the flea markets,
but they weren't worth anything.

04:51.377 --> 04:54.369
Anybody try to pawn this
in the past few days?

04:54.417 --> 04:58.376
You can get that on QVC for 9.99.
What would I want with that?

04:58.417 --> 05:01.932
He would've had
a faux-pearl necklace, faux-onyx.

05:01.977 --> 05:05.765
I don't deal in faux. Or stolen goods.

05:05.817 --> 05:09.332
That's why
it would've stuck out in your mind.

05:09.377 --> 05:12.016
- Two kids.
- Names?

05:12.057 --> 05:14.525
If I had bought the goods,

05:14.577 --> 05:19.526
I would've gotten names and address,
as required by law. But I didn't, so I didn't.

05:19.577 --> 05:24.014
- What did they look like?
- Colombian, Dominican,

05:24.057 --> 05:27.811
somethin' like that. I don't know.
Er, late teens.

05:27.857 --> 05:31.486
One was tall,
had dark hair, wearing a fade.

05:31.537 --> 05:36.531
The other guy was really short.
He had a hand tattoo.

05:36.577 --> 05:39.887
- Of?
- Barbed wire across the fingers.

05:39.937 --> 05:42.497
And a dagger. With blood drops.

05:42.537 --> 05:46.052
Would you mind
working with our composite artist?

05:50.177 --> 05:53.613
Mr Bosic! We'd like you
to take a look at this for us.

05:53.657 --> 05:57.730
Any help you need, you come see me 24/7.
These the guys that did it?

05:57.777 --> 06:00.337
Did anybody see them in the building?

06:00.377 --> 06:02.493
Or nearby.

06:02.537 --> 06:05.335
No, but if it'd help, I'd say what you want.

06:05.377 --> 06:08.687
- We don't want that.
- It's just so horrible,

06:08.737 --> 06:13.015
what happened to that poor lady.
I feel like I didn't do enough.

06:13.057 --> 06:15.252
How about your partner?

06:15.297 --> 06:18.209
- Jimmy? He was down in the truck.
- Where was it?

06:18.257 --> 06:20.646
- Right out in front.
- Jimmy!

06:21.777 --> 06:25.565
- Take a look at these for us.
- Oh, sure. I'd be glad to.

06:25.617 --> 06:30.168
Oh, yeah! A friend of mine
does these down at Amsterdam Avenue.

06:30.217 --> 06:32.606
But these are really good.

06:32.657 --> 06:36.775
- Meaning you recognise them?
- Sure do.

06:38.337 --> 06:42.171
Excuse me.
We're tryin' to put two names on these two.

06:42.217 --> 06:46.369
That looks like Carlos.
And the other one, that's Alfonso.

06:46.417 --> 06:50.012
- Do you have a last name?
- Carlos is Medina, same as mine.

06:50.057 --> 06:54.175
No relation, thank God.
Alfonso, I'm not sure. He's new.

06:54.217 --> 06:56.492
- But you know Carlos?
- Yeah.

06:56.537 --> 07:00.325
To get to the bodega,
down that block, you pass his building.

07:00.377 --> 07:04.336
It's the one before. He sits on that stoop,
cussing everyone who goes by.

07:04.377 --> 07:06.686
- Such a pene.
- Thanks.

07:06.737 --> 07:08.568
You're welcome.

07:08.617 --> 07:11.085
Victim's synagogue is past that bodega.

07:11.137 --> 07:14.891
Every week, she would've had to
walk right past that pendejo.

07:14.937 --> 07:18.009
- Yo, whassup, ladies?
- Whassup?

07:18.057 --> 07:20.287
Mi senorita!

07:20.337 --> 07:22.407
I know you smiling!

07:24.937 --> 07:28.816
Whassup, Diego?
What's goin' on, baby? How you feel?

07:28.857 --> 07:31.166
This looks a little more promising.

07:33.457 --> 07:37.450
What I tell you about that? Give me
the money, give me the money. Break.

07:37.497 --> 07:39.965
- Bonus.
- Meet up at the block.

07:40.017 --> 07:43.373
- Police!
- Break, break, break!

07:43.417 --> 07:45.977
Right there, pal. Right there!

07:46.017 --> 07:50.329
Hey! Where you goin'?
Against the fence. Against the fence.

07:52.697 --> 07:56.656
- Hey, out of my pocket, man!
- Soon as I hit bottom.

07:56.697 --> 08:02.294
I found Hoffa. What's this?
This poor dear retains water in her ankles.

08:02.337 --> 08:05.886
- You scored a diuretic, genius.
- What?

08:05.937 --> 08:08.974
You won't get high,
but will shed unsightly pounds.

08:09.017 --> 08:11.372
Me has embaucado, you douche!

08:11.417 --> 08:14.693
You want us to Mirandise you
in English and Spanish, we can.

08:14.737 --> 08:16.728
What have we got?

08:16.777 --> 08:18.733
Bernstein, Lenora.

08:18.777 --> 08:22.406
You know Lenora? Let's go talk about it.

08:22.457 --> 08:24.687
Don't say nothing. No dice nada.

08:28.337 --> 08:32.455
Can we get you somethin' to drink?
You probably want to get this over.

08:32.496 --> 08:36.376
Good. Let's make it quick and painless.
Have a seat.

08:39.537 --> 08:42.289
- Just tell us what happened.
- Ask Carlos.

08:42.337 --> 08:44.248
We're askin' you.

08:45.737 --> 08:49.093
What is it? You got a thing for
defenceless old ladies?

08:49.137 --> 08:53.335
- The kind with fancy jewellery?
- You climbed up her fire escape.

08:53.377 --> 08:56.926
You're thinkin',
'My lucky day. The window's not locked.'

08:56.977 --> 09:00.253
You go in, tie her up, and you find squat.

09:00.297 --> 09:03.892
- Why don't you talk to Carlos?
- She says she sold her jewellery.

09:03.937 --> 09:07.054
- Which is true.
- But you don't believe her.

09:07.097 --> 09:09.895
- You're pissed, take it out on her.
- What?

09:09.937 --> 09:12.326
You look nervous to me, Alfonso.

09:14.817 --> 09:17.092
Why is that?

09:20.657 --> 09:24.093
- You the one who raped her?
- That's sick!

09:24.137 --> 09:26.731
I didn't rape no old lady!

09:26.777 --> 09:30.690
I'll tell you what,
we'll talk to Carlos about that.

09:36.257 --> 09:38.725
We disturbin' your beauty sleep?

09:38.777 --> 09:41.245
Don't worry about it.

09:42.057 --> 09:44.207
- Nice ink.
- I know.

09:44.257 --> 09:47.135
The guy you tried to unload
the jewellery on loved it.

09:47.177 --> 09:51.489
- We found that stuff on the street.
- Your prints were in her apartment.

09:52.537 --> 09:56.212
- Helped her with the groceries.
- Through the window?

09:56.257 --> 10:01.251
I could be wrong, but Good Samaritans
don't usually rape elderly women.

10:01.297 --> 10:05.495
- What did you say?
- We got DNA from your donation.

10:05.537 --> 10:09.576
You don't tell us
which one of you did it, it will.

10:09.617 --> 10:13.371
We're gonna take samples from both of you.

10:19.017 --> 10:21.531
Well, let's do it.

10:21.577 --> 10:24.296
Cos I didn't rape nobody.

10:29.897 --> 10:33.572
You were right.
Carlos cleared up everything.

10:33.617 --> 10:37.166
- So, I can go now?
- Why'd you do it?

10:37.217 --> 10:40.607
- What was goin' through your head?
- What?

10:40.657 --> 10:43.774
Your buddy has no problem
givin' us a DNA sample.

10:43.817 --> 10:46.854
Which makes it obvious you did the rape.

10:46.897 --> 10:49.969
- That led to a heart attack.
- That killed her.

10:50.017 --> 10:52.247
- Same as puttin' a bullet in her.
- No!

10:52.297 --> 10:54.765
- Yes.
- I don't understand.

10:54.817 --> 10:57.490
I didn't do anything like that!

10:57.537 --> 11:03.487
- He says he didn't do it.
- If he didn't, he'll consent to a DNA test.

11:03.537 --> 11:06.415
I don't got a problem with that.

11:12.337 --> 11:14.692
What's wrong?

11:14.737 --> 11:17.410
- We swabbed them and sent it out.
- And?

11:17.457 --> 11:20.255
- I don't think either will match.
- Why?

11:20.297 --> 11:23.289
- Too anxious.
- Falling over themselves to give it up.

11:23.337 --> 11:27.296
- One of 'em's playin' you, right?
- Or there's a third perp.

11:32.137 --> 11:35.812
I'm arraigning two boys.
Who the hell is this John Doe?

11:35.857 --> 11:38.929
The DNA came back.
It's neither of the boys we have.

11:38.977 --> 11:42.094
We have them on ripping the place off.
Not rape.

11:42.137 --> 11:45.573
What's this?
A fishing expedition for John Doe three?

11:45.617 --> 11:49.053
Exactly. We're not robbery.
We want the one who raped her.

11:49.097 --> 11:51.895
I wish you'd let me know
one was still at large.

11:51.937 --> 11:54.246
We thought there were just two.

11:54.297 --> 11:57.767
- Only two went to the pawn shop.
- Two seen at the building.

11:58.457 --> 12:02.166
- What about the guy they sold to?
- Who, Hiphop? Nothin'.

12:02.217 --> 12:05.607
So the smart one got away clean.
What do you want me to do?

12:05.657 --> 12:10.492
The boys won't give up any names.
Can you give us a bargaining chip?

12:10.537 --> 12:15.327
I can charge them with robbery one,
robbery two, and lesser charges.

12:15.377 --> 12:19.655
- If they give us what we want?
- Robbery two and criminal trespass.

12:19.697 --> 12:23.451
They're looking at five
instead of fifteen. I won't go lower.

12:24.177 --> 12:27.806
- Screw you, I ain't doin' five.
- Let us do the negotiating.

12:27.857 --> 12:31.736
If your client doesn't take the deal,
he's looking at 15.

12:31.777 --> 12:34.928
- Give us some time alone.
- I don't need time.

12:34.977 --> 12:37.775
They want the rapist. I want a free skate.

12:37.817 --> 12:42.333
This is serious jail time.
I don't think you're the gambler Carlos is.

12:42.377 --> 12:44.845
- Maybe we should.
- Shut up.

12:44.897 --> 12:47.934
I got us covered.
We're not the ones they want.

12:47.977 --> 12:53.415
Why are you letting this boy gamble
with your life? How old are you? 17?

12:53.457 --> 12:57.496
Take a good look at me.
In 15 years, you're gonna be as old as I am.

12:57.537 --> 12:59.971
Oh, please! Can we be serious here?

13:00.017 --> 13:05.137
If we get this guy on our own,
the deal is off. You'll both do the max.

13:05.177 --> 13:08.965
- And we will find him.
- Oh, knock yourself out.

13:10.737 --> 13:13.331
Enjoy the cavity search.

13:17.577 --> 13:20.774
We need Carlos Medina
and Alfonso Cardenas's files.

13:20.817 --> 13:23.092
To confirm they ditched school on the 14th.

13:23.137 --> 13:26.413
- Do you have a warrant?
- Could by the end of the day.

13:26.457 --> 13:28.766
Good enough.

13:30.617 --> 13:33.450
Actually, they did not skip school
on the 14th.

13:33.497 --> 13:36.136
- No?
- No. They were already suspended.

13:36.177 --> 13:38.327
- What they do?
- Broke into lockers.

13:38.377 --> 13:42.006
- Were they caught with another guy?
- No, just those two.

13:42.057 --> 13:45.606
Can you tell us who they hang with?
Who they get in trouble with?

13:48.777 --> 13:52.452
- You have someone in mind?
- For him, I'll wait on the warrant.

13:52.497 --> 13:55.250
Is he the principal's son or something?

13:56.297 --> 14:00.495
He and Carlos have history,
but I don't think they associate any more.

14:00.537 --> 14:02.687
His name?

14:02.737 --> 14:05.774
He cleaned up his act.
He's not who you want.

14:05.817 --> 14:09.287
- That's for us to decide.
- Emmanuel Clementa.

14:09.337 --> 14:13.012
While you look up his address,
check if he was in school on the 14th.

14:23.697 --> 14:28.452
Sneak it in, sneak it back out.
That your modus operandi, Emmanuel?

14:28.497 --> 14:31.455
Got two of your team-mates in jail.

14:31.497 --> 14:35.172
Carlos and Alfonso
aren't on my baseball team.

14:35.217 --> 14:39.051
How did you leave Mrs Bernstein's
apartment without anyone seein' you?

14:39.097 --> 14:41.327
By not being there.

14:43.697 --> 14:47.007
It's interesting
the effect guilt has on our bodies.

14:47.057 --> 14:49.127
- Yes.
- I have no guilt.

14:49.177 --> 14:52.692
- Sociopaths never do.
- I have no reason to feel guilty.

14:52.737 --> 14:56.650
An old woman is dead. She was raped.
You and Carlos used to hassle her.

14:56.697 --> 15:01.532
I haven't hung out with Carlos in a year.
Anyway, she gave us quarters.

15:01.577 --> 15:04.933
- So, for a buck, she'd be alive?
- Why you say that?

15:04.977 --> 15:09.016
It must've been insultin',
a white lady tossin' coins at you.

15:09.057 --> 15:12.652
- I'd be insulted.
- Yeah. We were like, 'Keep it.'

15:12.697 --> 15:16.406
- So, it was payback?
- Not for me. I got discipline.

15:16.457 --> 15:19.927
The discipline you had
when you ditched school that day?

15:19.977 --> 15:22.411
- I had things to do.
- Like?

15:23.657 --> 15:26.217
Tell us, or you can tell the judge.

15:27.497 --> 15:31.285
My little sister got in over her head,
if you know what I'm sayin'.

15:31.337 --> 15:33.532
No.

15:33.577 --> 15:36.250
I took her to the methadone clinic that day.

15:36.297 --> 15:38.891
My! Another Good Samaritan!

15:40.777 --> 15:44.486
Well, thanks for your help.
I am tapped out. How about you?

15:44.537 --> 15:48.052
Nada. And look who's empty-handed.

15:48.097 --> 15:51.692
St Emmanuel was at the methadone clinic
from 8am to 11:45.

15:51.737 --> 15:56.015
The receptionist saw him come in
at 9:00 and stay at least two hours.

15:56.057 --> 15:58.287
- He left and came back?
- No.

15:58.337 --> 16:00.771
She discussed baseball stats with him.

16:00.817 --> 16:03.377
Which drove the administrating nurse nuts.

16:03.417 --> 16:05.612
Baseball widow.

16:05.657 --> 16:09.332
- So, how close are we?
- We got sent back to square one.

16:09.377 --> 16:12.096
We'll have to give the boys a better offer.

16:12.137 --> 16:15.288
- ADA won't go lower than five.
- For both.

16:15.337 --> 16:18.693
- What if one does the max?
- The other walks?

16:18.737 --> 16:23.686
- I want the rapist. Any thoughts?
- Carlos is your typical sociopath.

16:23.737 --> 16:27.889
- He'll screw Alfonso.
- Give it to the sociopath?

16:27.937 --> 16:31.725
Alfonso's a follower. His loyalty
to Carlos makes him hard to turn.

16:31.777 --> 16:34.496
But he has a conscience and he's scared.

16:34.537 --> 16:37.893
Fear is a great motivator. Let's use it.

16:40.737 --> 16:43.171
Enjoying your stay?

16:43.217 --> 16:46.971
- Makin' friends, I see.
- I'm here to check on his welfare.

16:47.017 --> 16:49.372
He isn't doing well in here.

16:49.417 --> 16:52.295
How are you gonna handle 15 years?

16:52.337 --> 16:55.056
- Carlos says that won't happen.
- Carlos.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.691
Keep listening to Carlos, you'll end up dead.

16:57.737 --> 17:00.695
- Your point?
- We talked to the DA.

17:00.737 --> 17:05.094
He gives us the rapist,
the DA will drop him to third-degree robbery.

17:05.137 --> 17:09.175
They can sentence you as a youth at 17.
You can pull a year and a half.

17:09.217 --> 17:11.810
- Maybe even probation.
- No jail time.

17:11.857 --> 17:14.655
- It's possible.
- Will Carlos get it, too?

17:14.696 --> 17:17.689
No. Only one of you.

17:24.777 --> 17:27.371
Can I think about it?

17:27.416 --> 17:29.931
What is there is to think about?

17:29.977 --> 17:32.445
This is a once-in-a-lifetime offer.

17:36.097 --> 17:38.975
You wanna think about it? You got 12 hours.

17:39.017 --> 17:43.533
Think very hard, because
this is the biggest decision of your life.

17:45.457 --> 17:49.336
- Then it goes to Carlos.
- He's gonna take it in a heartbeat.

17:52.617 --> 17:54.892
- Any messages?
- Not about Alfonso.

17:54.937 --> 17:56.575
- Idiot.
- He won't deal?

17:56.617 --> 17:59.085
- He wants it.
- But he won't screw Carlos.

17:59.137 --> 18:01.856
- Carlos'd sell his mom for smokes.
- Yep.

18:01.897 --> 18:05.685
DA's office called. You got a taker.
They're waiting for you.

18:09.217 --> 18:11.606
What are you doin' here?

18:11.657 --> 18:14.251
- I heard there's a deal.
- On Alfonso's table.

18:14.297 --> 18:16.765
Alfonso had a dilemma.

18:16.817 --> 18:20.332
He asked for my advice
and I had to counsel him against it.

18:20.377 --> 18:24.529
My client is quite amenable to the terms.

18:24.577 --> 18:27.137
- Shall we begin?
- It's up to you.

18:28.097 --> 18:30.133
Yeah.

18:30.177 --> 18:34.807
The deal's contingent upon
your information leading to an arrest.

18:34.857 --> 18:37.769
And he allocutes.

18:37.817 --> 18:40.695
What?

18:40.737 --> 18:42.887
Oh!

18:42.937 --> 18:46.566
I got no problem telling what happened.
Where should I start?

18:46.617 --> 18:49.290
- Where we came through the window?
- Who's we?

18:49.337 --> 18:52.727
Alfonso, I thought,
was gonna bail right there.

18:52.817 --> 18:56.492
- What about the other guy?
- She has nothin'. I trash the place.

18:56.537 --> 19:01.452
I teach that bitch.
But all of a sudden, there's this noise.

19:01.497 --> 19:04.933
- What kind of noise?
- A cuckoo clock.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.172
Only it's freaky loud.

19:07.217 --> 19:10.573
Alfonso almost fills his drawers.
He takes off.

19:10.617 --> 19:13.085
- How many times did it cuckoo?
- Once.

19:13.137 --> 19:16.732
- Once on the half hour. 9:30.
- So, I chase down Alfonso.

19:16.777 --> 19:20.975
- He's on the stairs.
- You leave the other guy with her?

19:21.017 --> 19:24.293
- I didn't leave nobody.
- Let me explain something.

19:24.337 --> 19:27.966
You jerk us around,
you jerk your deal off the table.

19:29.097 --> 19:31.736
So I drag Alfonso's sorry ass back.

19:31.777 --> 19:37.329
But there's a guy outside the door.
A white guy. Beige uniform.

19:37.377 --> 19:41.086
Just hold on right here.
You're saying none of you raped her.

19:41.137 --> 19:43.332
The guy was carrying a clipboard.

19:43.377 --> 19:47.256
Had a logo on his pocket
with letters that didn't spell anything.

19:47.297 --> 19:50.892
Anyways, this guy
walks through the door we left open.

19:50.937 --> 19:54.373
Alfonso was like,
'We trashed the place, we need to go.'

19:54.417 --> 19:58.092
- The delivery man raped her?
- Yeah.

19:58.137 --> 20:00.935
I mean, how sick is that? Huh?

20:04.777 --> 20:07.337
- The delivery guy?
- So Carlos said.

20:07.377 --> 20:11.131
Not a delinquent buddy,
but a good citizen? Yeah, right.

20:11.177 --> 20:15.887
- Carlos described his uniform.
- There are holes in Stan's story.

20:15.937 --> 20:19.816
He went in at 9:30,
but Stan didn't call 911 for 23 minutes.

20:19.857 --> 20:23.293
- What can you do in 23 minutes?
- What can't you do?

20:23.337 --> 20:27.216
He called it in and stayed there
while EMS tried to resuscitate.

20:27.257 --> 20:31.489
Guy starts a fire, reports it,
helps put it out. Hero syndrome.

20:31.537 --> 20:35.849
Or Carlos takes a hero and turns him
into the patsy. Schmuck syndrome.

20:35.897 --> 20:39.731
The elderly victim, the hurried sex act,

20:39.777 --> 20:43.292
- it points to a less mature guy.
- Like a Carlos.

20:43.337 --> 20:47.489
We have to tread lightly here, folks.
I mean, Stan made every paper.

20:47.537 --> 20:50.768
We don't want another
Richard Jewell on our hands.

20:50.817 --> 20:53.047
So check him out thoroughly.

20:53.697 --> 20:56.769
- What's wrong with you two?
- Alfonso's attorney called.

20:56.817 --> 20:59.047
- Now he wants to deal.
- Desperately.

20:59.097 --> 21:03.010
He's not the only one with troubles.
I got Stan's record.

21:03.057 --> 21:05.048
Stan has a record?

21:05.097 --> 21:08.009
Mm-hm. He spent some time in Sing Sing.

21:08.057 --> 21:10.048
- What for?
- Armed robbery.

21:10.097 --> 21:12.930
- Sexual assaults?
- None that he was busted for.

21:12.977 --> 21:18.210
If he did, he had to tell. And cell mates?
Great captive audiences.

21:18.257 --> 21:20.817
- Who did he bunk with?
- Jonathan Schmidt.

21:20.857 --> 21:22.927
- In or out?
- Out.

21:26.977 --> 21:30.094
Yeah, I remember Stan.
Talk about hard time.

21:30.137 --> 21:33.095
He rubbed you the wrong way, huh?

21:33.137 --> 21:37.688
Havin' skin peeled off would've been
more pleasurable. Cat never shut up.

21:37.737 --> 21:40.092
About what? Crimes he got away with?

21:40.137 --> 21:44.494
Nothin' to do with that.
Couldn't walk five feet to the trash can?

21:44.537 --> 21:48.769
- So, what he talk about?
- Female exploits, what else?

21:48.817 --> 21:52.856
He was the joke of the cell block.
Stan the Man, they called him.

21:52.897 --> 21:54.888
You stay in touch?

21:54.937 --> 21:57.246
He called me a couple months ago.

21:57.297 --> 21:59.253
And?

21:59.297 --> 22:01.413
And he goes on and on

22:01.457 --> 22:05.450
about this cush job he has
in pharmaceutical transportation.

22:05.497 --> 22:08.933
And how he's boffin'
half the women on his round.

22:08.977 --> 22:12.094
He told you he was having sex
with women he was delivering to?

22:12.137 --> 22:15.971
If you let him tell it,
no woman could resist him.

22:22.177 --> 22:25.135
- 'Jimmy, isn't it?'
- Yeah! Who are you?

22:25.177 --> 22:27.930
Detectives Jeffries and Munch.
You going to work?

22:27.977 --> 22:29.729
Yeah. I have to be there by 9:00.

22:29.777 --> 22:33.531
I understand it's enjoyable work.
For Stan, at least.

22:33.577 --> 22:37.126
- Stan the Man.
- We heard he was irresistible.

22:37.177 --> 22:40.249
We also heard he's boffin'
half the women on the route.

22:40.297 --> 22:41.525
Really?

22:41.577 --> 22:45.775
If you know anything, tell us,
or we'll charge you with obstruction.

22:45.817 --> 22:47.330
What do you wanna know?

22:47.377 --> 22:52.371
You two in that truck all day,
Stan the talker, I'm sure sex comes up.

22:52.417 --> 22:54.089
Oh! Yeah!

22:54.137 --> 22:57.368
He ever talk about having sex
with women you deliver to?

22:57.417 --> 23:00.773
All the time.
Special deliveries, he calls them.

23:00.817 --> 23:03.456
What about Mrs Bernstein?

23:03.497 --> 23:07.410
- What about her?
- He make a special delivery to her?

23:08.457 --> 23:11.255
Nope. I have to... pick up a newspaper.

23:12.697 --> 23:14.972
Think he knows more than he's telling us?

23:15.017 --> 23:19.135
Volumes. Think it's time
we talked to 't.e man' himself.

23:21.337 --> 23:25.728
- Hey! What brings you down here?
- We need to clear up a few things.

23:25.777 --> 23:27.654
Anything I can do to help.

23:27.697 --> 23:30.131
It'd be easier if we did this at the station.

23:30.177 --> 23:34.967
- I still got deliveries to make.
- They can wait.

23:37.657 --> 23:41.696
For the last time, I never did any customers.
Not once, never.

23:41.737 --> 23:44.888
- That's not what we heard.
- I brag, all right?

23:44.937 --> 23:47.246
- Huh!
- OK, lie.

23:47.297 --> 23:50.289
- Like on your job application?
- About being an ex-con.

23:50.337 --> 23:52.168
They wouldn't have hired me.

23:52.217 --> 23:54.492
And when they find out about
Mrs Bernstein?

23:54.537 --> 23:57.370
- I never touched her!
- How did you give her CPR?

23:57.417 --> 23:59.453
How...?

24:00.817 --> 24:04.207
OK. OK. I didn't. I didn't give her CPR.

24:04.257 --> 24:08.409
- I didn't even find her.
- There you go with the lies again.

24:08.457 --> 24:12.211
Witnesses saw you go in
20 minutes before you said.

24:12.257 --> 24:15.647
No, no. You got it wrong.
They didn't see me, they saw Jimmy.

24:15.697 --> 24:18.416
You want us to believe
you're covering for Jimmy?

24:18.457 --> 24:22.132
Not for him, for me. OK, look.

24:22.177 --> 24:27.126
I'm supposed to make the deliveries.
He's not certified to hook up tanks.

24:27.177 --> 24:30.806
When there's a building without elevators,
he walks it up for me.

24:33.377 --> 24:38.292
He was takin' so long, I went up.
I found the new tank by the door,

24:38.337 --> 24:40.646
her tied to the bed
and Jimmy in the bathroom.

24:40.697 --> 24:43.006
- What was he doing?
- Freaking out.

24:43.057 --> 24:46.413
I figured he walked in on
what I did, couldn't cope.

24:46.457 --> 24:47.572
But you could.

24:47.617 --> 24:52.771
It seemed like a win-win. He doesn't
have to deal with it, I keep my job,

24:52.817 --> 24:55.809
and it gets my name in the papers.

24:58.617 --> 25:01.848
- I'm not lyin' this time.
- No?

25:01.897 --> 25:03.649
No.

25:03.697 --> 25:06.211
We've got witnesses. We can clear it up.

25:06.257 --> 25:09.169
We'll put you both in the line-up
and see who saw what.

25:22.377 --> 25:24.368
Carlos, do you recognise anyone?

25:26.057 --> 25:28.696
- No.
- Take your time.

25:28.737 --> 25:32.093
I don't need it! He's not there!
What y'all playin'?

25:34.177 --> 25:37.010
- All right, send in the next group.
- What's with you?

25:37.057 --> 25:41.050
I told you exactly who it was.
And he ain't there...

25:41.097 --> 25:43.088
- That's him!
- Which one?

25:43.137 --> 25:47.255
Number one. Gilligan's Island dude.
That's the dopey face I saw.

25:47.297 --> 25:49.765
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Can I go?

25:49.817 --> 25:53.366
- My client's fulfilled the deal.
- Only if it leads to an arrest.

25:53.417 --> 25:55.772
I'll send over the paperwork when it does.

26:04.137 --> 26:08.608
Just got the final autopsy report.
She had two separate heart attacks.

26:08.657 --> 26:12.047
The first one caused a partial occlusion
in a diagonal branch.

26:12.097 --> 26:15.407
- When did she have the first one?
- Within an hour of the fatal one.

26:15.457 --> 26:17.334
When the kids broke in.

26:17.377 --> 26:20.096
Did the first contribute to the second?

26:20.137 --> 26:24.847
The ME says if it hadn't weakened
her heart, she might have survived.

26:24.897 --> 26:28.526
- We cut Carlos loose.
- Let's not lose anyone else.

26:31.937 --> 26:34.576
- You understand your rights?
- Yeah.

26:34.617 --> 26:37.415
Who brought the tank
up to Mrs Bernstein, you or Stan?

26:37.457 --> 26:40.733
Me. I always took the tanks.
Stan has a bad back.

26:40.777 --> 26:45.487
- Was the door open or closed?
- Open. But not all the way.

26:45.537 --> 26:48.973
- Just a little bit. But it was open.
- Mm-hm.

26:49.017 --> 26:51.212
- So what did you do then?
- I went in.

26:52.337 --> 26:55.886
- You notice anything unusual?
- Oh... yeah. Yeah.

26:55.937 --> 26:58.849
- It didn't look like it usually did.
- How did it look?

26:58.897 --> 27:01.855
Ooh... Messy.

27:01.897 --> 27:03.888
- Messy?
- Yeah.

27:03.937 --> 27:05.928
- That it?
- Yeah.

27:05.977 --> 27:10.255
- I was gonna help.
- Help what? Help her clean up?

27:10.297 --> 27:14.336
Yeah. I called, 'Hey, Mrs Bernstein!'

27:14.377 --> 27:17.528
- She answer?
- No. So I went lookin' for her.

27:19.257 --> 27:21.612
Where'd you find her?

27:22.737 --> 27:24.967
- B-Bedroom.
- Where in the bedroom?

27:25.017 --> 27:27.008
On the bed.

27:28.017 --> 27:30.292
Anyone else there?

27:30.337 --> 27:32.293
No.

27:33.297 --> 27:36.892
Can you describe the condition
in which you found her?

27:36.937 --> 27:38.689
I... What was that?

27:38.737 --> 27:41.535
How did she look on the bed?

27:42.537 --> 27:45.051
Er... she looked...

27:45.097 --> 27:50.296
She looked nice. She was...
She was wearing her nightie.

27:51.577 --> 27:54.489
She looked happy to see me.

27:54.537 --> 27:57.495
- That when you tied her up?
- N-No! I didn't tie her up.

27:57.537 --> 28:02.657
I gotta tell you, we think you did,
and we also think you raped her.

28:02.697 --> 28:05.416
- You raped an old woman!
- Then you killed her.

28:05.457 --> 28:07.049
No!

28:13.977 --> 28:16.047
You wanted to see me?

28:16.097 --> 28:18.657
Yeah, shut the door, please.

28:20.657 --> 28:23.729
You wrote a psych evaluation
on Jimmy Walp.

28:23.777 --> 28:25.847
No, actually, I didn't.

28:25.897 --> 28:28.092
According to his attorney, you did.

28:28.137 --> 28:33.257
If he proves Jimmy didn't understand
his Miranda, we lose his statement.

28:33.297 --> 28:34.889
And anything that came after.

28:34.937 --> 28:38.930
How could you give them
that ammunition in writing? I asked...

28:38.977 --> 28:44.290
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I put a sticky
on your desk by his DD5, that's all.

28:44.337 --> 28:49.127
- What was on this bombshell sticky?
- 'Retarded' and a question mark.

28:49.177 --> 28:51.930
- Never should've left this office.
- Well, it did.

28:51.977 --> 28:54.411
It made it into the discovery packet.

28:54.457 --> 28:57.051
The hearing is Monday.
Anything you can dig up

28:57.097 --> 29:00.726
refuting his alleged retardation
would be greatly appreciated.

29:02.897 --> 29:08.096
Well, let's start digging and not stop
until we get this guy in Mensa.

29:09.977 --> 29:13.765
- Pulled his Board of Ed records.
- According to the DSM criteria,

29:13.817 --> 29:16.968
an IQ of 70 or below classifies him
as retarded. What's his?

29:17.017 --> 29:19.008
- He hasn't got one.
- It's not there?

29:19.057 --> 29:21.696
- He was never tested.
- Everybody's tested.

29:21.737 --> 29:23.807
He missed a lot of school.

29:23.857 --> 29:26.735
- What about his grades?
- Ds and Fs.

29:26.777 --> 29:30.372
That doesn't prove anything.
Einstein consistently flunked math.

29:30.417 --> 29:35.047
We'll argue he's another Einstein.
What about his work history?

29:35.097 --> 29:38.772
He was even fired from McDonalds.
That alone'll win their case.

29:38.817 --> 29:42.856
But he got jobs. He lived on his own,
unsupervised, unassisted.

29:42.897 --> 29:44.888
Which, believe me, is no easy feat.

29:44.937 --> 29:49.089
Jimmy? He's no trouble.
You're not here about that guy in 201?

29:49.137 --> 29:51.128
We're sure.

29:55.937 --> 29:59.407
- We'll lock up when we leave.
- Whoa, a lot of books.

30:00.297 --> 30:03.972
Got everything from, er, Danielle Steel to...

30:04.017 --> 30:08.249
Look at this.
Introduction To Thermonuclear Physics.

30:08.297 --> 30:13.291
This is such a crock. Tell me, how
many retarded guys read James Joyce?

30:13.377 --> 30:15.845
- In the box.
- He's a big reader.

30:15.897 --> 30:18.616
- Sits outside readin' the paper.
- Is that right?

30:18.657 --> 30:22.286
I say, 'What's the good news?'
He says, 'Tell you when I find it.'

30:22.337 --> 30:26.933
Look. Guy's kept every receipt
he ever got, all paid with cash.

30:26.977 --> 30:29.775
Cash. Cash. No credit cards.

30:29.817 --> 30:35.016
- That makes him smarter than me.
- No chequebook. No diary.

30:35.057 --> 30:38.288
- But he's got a lot of porn.
- In the box.

30:40.097 --> 30:42.088
There's no kitchen here.

30:42.137 --> 30:44.856
We got a stove. What do you know?
Filled with books.

30:44.897 --> 30:49.368
- And newspapers. Where does he eat?
- Lilly's Diner. Religiously.

30:49.417 --> 30:54.207
Health Department closed it down
for a week, I think he lost 10lbs.

30:54.257 --> 30:58.933
He's a regular. Comes in twice a day,
three times on the weekend.

30:58.977 --> 31:01.889
- Alone?
- Always. Which is odd,

31:01.937 --> 31:06.055
because he's a friendly guy.
He talks to whoever's beside him.

31:06.097 --> 31:09.487
He come across to you as... slow?

31:09.537 --> 31:13.894
He ain't in any hurry.
He studies the menu. Drives me nuts.

31:13.937 --> 31:17.327
- Why?
- Because he always gets the special.

31:17.377 --> 31:22.167
Every time. Er, 'scuse me. Guy over
on table two's gonna have a coronary

31:22.217 --> 31:24.048
if he doesn't get a coffee.

31:25.097 --> 31:28.931
Isn't it interesting how
not one person he dealt with daily

31:28.977 --> 31:32.174
picked up on
any developmental disabilities?

31:32.217 --> 31:35.095
Of course, they had limited contact with him.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.967
No. He was never any trouble.

31:41.017 --> 31:43.008
What was he like as a child?

31:43.057 --> 31:47.892
Er... You know, I had seven.
Jimmy was the sixth.

31:47.937 --> 31:51.486
I remember I could sit him in front of the TV

31:51.537 --> 31:55.291
and not have to worry about him for hours.

31:55.337 --> 31:58.852
It's hard to give each kid
the attention they deserve.

31:58.897 --> 32:01.172
Maybe he didn't get enough,

32:01.217 --> 32:05.813
but, er, when I had him,
I was just so tired.

32:05.857 --> 32:08.815
Jimmy missed a lot of school.
Why was that?

32:08.857 --> 32:14.489
He was usually an angel, but he had
bad days and I had to keep him home.

32:14.537 --> 32:16.687
Did you think of getting him tested?

32:16.737 --> 32:18.693
For what?

32:18.737 --> 32:20.887
Learning disorders.

32:20.937 --> 32:25.772
He isn't retarded. I'm his mother.
I would know something like that.

32:26.817 --> 32:29.889
- When did you last speak with him?
- It's been a while.

32:29.937 --> 32:33.407
Er, I guess it was when he left home.

32:33.457 --> 32:38.611
- You mean, when he was 18?
- Maybe I'm not the best mother,

32:38.657 --> 32:43.048
but you don't know what it's like
raising seven children by myself.

32:43.097 --> 32:45.486
Did Jimmy ever have any girlfriends?

32:45.537 --> 32:48.415
No. He never had much luck in that area.

32:48.457 --> 32:50.687
How about friends?

32:50.737 --> 32:52.932
No.

32:53.937 --> 32:56.497
Defence gave him an IQ test.
I got the results.

32:56.537 --> 32:59.005
- Yea or nay?
- He just missed the cut. 68.

32:59.057 --> 33:02.732
It wouldn't be in his best interests
to try hard.

33:02.777 --> 33:07.214
It's odd. Nothing has his writing on.
Not even a grocery list.

33:07.257 --> 33:09.930
Interesting, but not as interesting as this.

33:09.977 --> 33:13.447
Insatiable Bondage Sluts. That's nice.

33:14.697 --> 33:18.485
Charming, but not illegal,
and certainly not admissible in court.

33:18.537 --> 33:20.528
Mm-hm. Turn it over.

33:22.617 --> 33:25.085
Wow. Eerily familiar, huh?

33:25.137 --> 33:28.174
Same staging as Mrs Bernstein,
down to the shade of pink.

33:28.217 --> 33:31.129
- Except the 50-year age gap.
- He didn't stage it.

33:31.177 --> 33:35.295
Carlos and Alfonso tied her up.
That's how Jimmy found her.

33:35.337 --> 33:36.929
- How's it goin'?
- Great.

33:36.977 --> 33:39.172
- Hey.
- What have we found?

33:39.217 --> 33:43.256
Jimmy Walp's belongings.
What do you make of that?

33:44.297 --> 33:48.973
He walked into that room,
saw a tableau from this tape, got excited.

33:49.017 --> 33:52.851
- And committed a felony.
- He misreads social cues

33:52.897 --> 33:55.127
and mimics to appear normal.

33:55.177 --> 33:58.487
He may have thought
he was expected to perform the sex act.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.971
Whose side are you on?

34:01.017 --> 34:05.215
I think we all wanna see justice done.
He needs to be incarcerated.

34:05.257 --> 34:07.248
The question is where.

34:07.297 --> 34:12.451
They do send the mentally retarded to
prison. There are 250 on Death Row.

34:12.496 --> 34:16.456
The system is slanted against them.
They tend to incriminate themselves,

34:16.496 --> 34:18.886
they're unable to assist in their own defence.

34:18.937 --> 34:22.612
They're so eager to please,
they confess to things they didn't do.

34:22.657 --> 34:24.612
Jimmy is mildly retarded.

34:24.657 --> 34:27.853
He did not understand
the consequences of his actions.

34:27.897 --> 34:30.286
OK. That it? Finished here?

34:30.337 --> 34:34.250
Jimmy Walp went his entire life
without being diagnosed, until now.

34:34.297 --> 34:36.333
I find that awfully convenient.

34:36.377 --> 34:39.847
- I find it tragic.
- We're going ahead with this.

34:39.897 --> 34:42.616
He understands enough to be accountable.

34:42.657 --> 34:46.730
He knows he did something wrong.
We are not losing his statement.

34:53.897 --> 34:56.456
He maintained a job and an apartment.

34:56.496 --> 35:01.332
Our investigation turned up no records
diagnosing him as mentally retarded.

35:01.377 --> 35:04.130
We found no conclusive evidence
indicating he is.

35:04.177 --> 35:06.372
Thank you, Detective.

35:06.417 --> 35:11.889
Detective, books from my client's
residence were entered into evidence.

35:11.937 --> 35:15.054
You tried to cite them
as proof of his reading ability.

35:15.097 --> 35:19.773
Do you know the lengths
the mentally retarded will go to disguise it?

35:19.817 --> 35:22.285
They'll pretend to read in public,

35:22.337 --> 35:28.333
parrot phrases to appear knowledgeable,
wear a watch when they can't tell time.

35:28.377 --> 35:33.132
My client spent his life fooling people
into believing he is of normal intelligence.

35:33.177 --> 35:37.090
- Is there a question here?
- Your question, Mr Trask.

35:37.137 --> 35:42.450
- Did you ask Jimmy to read out loud?
- I found no reason to do that.

35:42.497 --> 35:46.570
But you showed him his Miranda,
and asked him to read it before signing?

35:46.617 --> 35:49.177
- Yes, but I also read it to him.
- Jimmy.

35:50.217 --> 35:53.732
Do you remember talking to
Detective Stabler on March 21st?

35:53.777 --> 35:56.416
- Yep.
- Did he explain your rights to you?

35:56.457 --> 35:57.810
Yep.

35:57.857 --> 36:00.690
Can you explain what your rights are?

36:02.817 --> 36:06.412
Yeah. You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say...

36:06.457 --> 36:09.529
can and will be held against you
in a court of law.

36:09.577 --> 36:13.047
Very good.
Now, can you explain what it means?

36:15.337 --> 36:19.125
- Those are your rights.
- But can you explain them?

36:20.737 --> 36:23.126
- I just did.
- OK.

36:24.657 --> 36:27.808
What is a court of law?

36:28.817 --> 36:31.012
Due process?

36:32.857 --> 36:36.406
What is the role of the judge?

36:44.617 --> 36:46.926
No further questions.

36:49.097 --> 36:51.053
Jimmy.

36:51.097 --> 36:53.565
- Yep?
- Do you know why you're here?

36:53.617 --> 36:56.290
- Yeah. Because of Mrs Bernstein.
- Your Honour,

36:56.337 --> 36:59.056
this hearing is on the statement only.

36:59.097 --> 37:01.930
Yes. Counsellor,
please confine your questions.

37:01.977 --> 37:06.528
Jimmy... your attorney put
a lot of people on the stand today.

37:06.577 --> 37:08.010
I know.

37:08.057 --> 37:12.175
They presented... evaluations,
professional opinions

37:12.217 --> 37:15.414
and test results, all saying...

37:15.457 --> 37:18.415
that you are mentally retarded.

37:18.457 --> 37:22.416
Everyone I put on the stand...
says that you're not.

37:22.457 --> 37:25.051
But nobody asked you.

37:26.297 --> 37:29.289
Are you mentally retarded?

37:29.337 --> 37:32.488
- No.
- Your Honour, I'd like it noted

37:32.537 --> 37:35.813
that it is common for the retarded
to deny their retardation.

37:35.857 --> 37:38.655
- So noted.
- Hey! I am not retarded!

37:41.857 --> 37:44.007
Is there any way you can prove that?

37:44.057 --> 37:46.617
I can tell you what I did to Mrs Bernstein.

37:46.657 --> 37:49.296
- Objection!
- She was not dressed.

37:49.337 --> 37:53.728
- Her hands were tied up here.
- Jimmy, don't say anything else!

37:53.777 --> 37:56.496
And she was moaning. And it was...

37:56.537 --> 37:58.209
sssso...

37:58.257 --> 38:01.135
so... exciting.

38:02.817 --> 38:04.808
Your Honour...

38:04.857 --> 38:09.453
I'd like to hear what he has to say.
This will be off the record.

38:09.497 --> 38:11.488
Go ahead.

38:13.257 --> 38:15.817
I knew what she wanted.

38:15.857 --> 38:19.975
I'd seen it on the videos,
but I had never done it before.

38:22.537 --> 38:25.574
I got on top of her... and...

38:27.657 --> 38:30.967
It felt... really good!

38:31.977 --> 38:36.926
And then I tried to kiss her,
and I could see that, um... that, um,

38:36.977 --> 38:40.253
you know, something was wrong,
and I thought that...

38:40.297 --> 38:44.370
maybe I did something wrong,
so... I tried to do, er, the, um...

38:46.417 --> 38:48.726
the...

38:48.777 --> 38:52.213
the CPR that I... I seen on the TV.

38:52.257 --> 38:56.808
But, you know,
I guess I was doin' that wrong, too, and so...

38:56.857 --> 38:59.166
I got scared.

39:01.257 --> 39:03.248
And, um, I didn't...

39:03.297 --> 39:06.687
I didn't know how to explain
to anybody what happened, so...

39:06.737 --> 39:09.251
I went to the bathroom and, um...

39:10.457 --> 39:14.769
I was hiding in the bathroom
when Stan came in, and...

39:17.337 --> 39:20.056
told me that the old lady was dead.

39:35.057 --> 39:36.934
Captain. We should get together

39:36.977 --> 39:40.094
on a recommendation to the court
when you have time.

39:40.137 --> 39:45.291
Time? Write your report and put
my name on it. What's the difference?

39:45.337 --> 39:49.535
- What's eating you?
- The guy on the stand, OK?

39:49.577 --> 39:54.367
Maybe he's retarded, maybe not.
But we're talkin' about two IQ points!

39:54.417 --> 39:57.568
He was devastated by what he did.
You saw.

39:57.617 --> 40:01.530
No, I saw remorse.
He knew exactly what he was doing.

40:01.577 --> 40:05.252
When I get insomnia,
I think about the sociopathic killers

40:05.297 --> 40:08.414
I got sent to Attica. I sleep like a baby.

40:08.457 --> 40:12.689
But he's just a retarded guy
that made a bad mistake.

40:12.737 --> 40:17.015
Fine. It's the system.
Let's just put him in some quiet place

40:17.057 --> 40:19.935
where he can read Winnie The Pooh
and get hot chocolate,

40:19.977 --> 40:23.094
while Mrs Bernstein...
remember her? Gets a headstone.

40:24.177 --> 40:25.974
Whatever.

40:33.817 --> 40:37.173
OK, Jimmy, first they'll do
the paperwork, get you a room,

40:37.217 --> 40:39.731
then Dr Krasnow will see you
for the intake exam.

40:39.777 --> 40:42.496
- Dr who?
- Krasnow. He's very nice.

40:42.537 --> 40:46.815
- I've known him for years.
- Aren't you gonna stay with me?

40:46.857 --> 40:48.848
For a while, OK?

40:59.497 --> 41:01.692
No! No! Get back! Get back!
