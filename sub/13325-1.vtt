WEBVTT

00:01.434 --> 00:03.569
Great session,
everybody.

00:03.571 --> 00:06.205
And don't forget--
do your best, don't assume,

00:06.207 --> 00:08.640
Don't take it personal,
and be your word.

00:08.642 --> 00:10.676
I'll never remember all that.
I'm just gonna pick two.

00:10.678 --> 00:13.412
I'll take assume
and that word thing.

00:13.414 --> 00:16.348
Oh, man.
I was gonna do
the word thing.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.350
Everybody can do
the word thing.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.052
It wasn't meant to be
an assignment.

00:20.054 --> 00:22.021
- It's more of a motto.
- Ed: <i>It's too long.</i>

00:22.023 --> 00:24.056
A motto's gotta fit
on a bumper sticker

00:24.058 --> 00:28.093
Like "adam and eve,
not adam and steve."

00:28.095 --> 00:31.263
Ed, you should check
your bumper because the one
on your car now says

00:31.265 --> 00:33.465
"my other ride is a penis."

00:33.467 --> 00:37.169
How do these things happen?
It's a mystery.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.605
Guys, guys.
If bumper stickers
ever changed people's minds,

00:39.607 --> 00:41.573
We wouldn't even
be here right now

00:41.575 --> 00:44.743
Because we'd all rather
be fishing and braking
for boobs.

00:44.745 --> 00:47.780
- See ya Monday.
- Sorry to barge in.

00:47.782 --> 00:49.681
I'm just outside
waiting, dad.

00:51.484 --> 00:54.219
Everybody,
I'd like to introduce
my daughter edie.

00:54.221 --> 00:57.356
I hate that name.
Y'all just call me
little ed.

00:57.358 --> 01:01.260
This is fantastic.

01:02.662 --> 01:06.432
My car broke down.
I hope you don't mind
I had her pick me up here.

01:06.434 --> 01:09.401
I put in a new clutch,
but your throwout
bearing's fine.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.703
I need to pick up
a new pressure plate,

01:11.705 --> 01:14.473
But jenny's at the gyno
and won't be opening up
the shop till four.

01:16.176 --> 01:18.844
Who else feels like
they just learned a lot?

01:18.846 --> 01:20.779
About cars?
We all did.

01:20.781 --> 01:23.549
Like I said,
I'll see ya Monday.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.217
Great meeting, y'all.

01:25.219 --> 01:27.319
- You mind if I grab a muffin?
- Of course not.

01:27.321 --> 01:29.655
- There's also danish.
- Nah.

01:29.657 --> 01:31.790
I just got a thing
about muffins.

01:35.261 --> 01:38.597
So, ed, your daughter
knows a lot about cars.

01:38.599 --> 01:42.167
Did she learn that
from her... Boyfriend?

01:42.169 --> 01:44.736
Nah, she's just a natural
with machines.

01:44.738 --> 01:47.106
You know,
I can't remember a time

01:47.108 --> 01:49.108
When she didn't have
a hammer or a drill

01:49.110 --> 01:51.176
Or something
strapped on her.

01:55.415 --> 01:58.117
All right,
I am bleeding
from biting my lip.

01:58.119 --> 01:59.785
This is huge.

01:59.787 --> 02:02.721
Can't we just get ed
back in here and tell him
that his daughter is gay?

02:02.723 --> 02:05.724
I don't think he knows
and I am willing to pay

02:05.726 --> 02:08.760
For the extra half hour
to tell him right now.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.863
Patrick, that is not
how group works.

02:10.865 --> 02:14.233
Even if she is gay,
no one here can
force the issue.

02:14.235 --> 02:16.668
Yeah, or ed's daughter
will kick your ass.

02:18.872 --> 02:21.573
- Hey, got a minute?
- Sure, what's up?

02:21.575 --> 02:23.475
This came for you.

02:23.477 --> 02:27.713
Not when I know
you're trying to get me
out of the room, I don't.

02:27.715 --> 02:30.516
We don't hide things
from our daughter, jen.

02:30.518 --> 02:33.619
Aw, crap. It's from meredith.
Sam, get out. It's a secret.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.587
Who's meredith?

02:35.589 --> 02:37.856
I think you're
old enough now.

02:37.858 --> 02:40.459
My sister.
Your aunt meredith.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.728
I have an aunt
that I don't even know about?

02:42.730 --> 02:46.265
How about being grateful
for all the relatives
we did tell you about?

02:46.267 --> 02:49.401
You should be ashamed
of yourself. Now go to
your room right now.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.537
I can't believe this.

02:51.539 --> 02:53.639
Do I have a brother
that I don't know about, too?

02:53.641 --> 02:54.873
I hope not.

02:57.944 --> 03:01.213
How many times do I have
to move to get away from
this screaming harpy?

03:01.215 --> 03:02.948
Well, just give the harpy
your new address.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.217
I don't want any more letters
from the underworld.

03:06.686 --> 03:09.888
Oh, my god.
She's having
a baby shower.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.257
The evil one
is about to spawn.

03:13.927 --> 03:16.395
Well, she deserves
every stretch mark
she gets.

03:16.397 --> 03:20.265
She's an awful person,
charlie. I do not like her.

03:20.267 --> 03:22.901
I still get pissed when I think
about what she said to you
at our baby shower.

03:22.903 --> 03:25.637
"are you sure
you're emotionally stable
enough to be a mom?"

03:25.639 --> 03:27.906
"you could still put
the option in adoption."

03:27.908 --> 03:29.908
Stupid bitch.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.877
I know.

03:31.879 --> 03:35.214
Like we weren't ready
to have a baby.

03:35.216 --> 03:37.883
We planned that baby, right?

03:37.885 --> 03:40.719
Yeah, we planned it.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.788
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

03:45.291 --> 03:46.792
I don't talk to
my sister for 10 years.

03:46.794 --> 03:48.860
I get one letter from her,
it torpedoes my entire week.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.797
Have you ever opened up
a dialogue with meredith
about this?

03:51.799 --> 03:55.834
Depends. Is "screw you"
"no, screw you" a dialogue?

03:55.836 --> 03:59.371
It doesn't sound like
you've had any real
communication.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.540
I've tried.
10 years ago--

04:01.542 --> 04:03.342
The last time we talked--

04:03.344 --> 04:05.911
She brought up
the babysitting money
she claims I stole from her.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.980
I brought up christmas
where she showed up high.

04:07.982 --> 04:11.283
She brought up easter
where I showed up high.

04:11.285 --> 04:15.454
- How'd it end?
- That's how "screw you"
"no, screw you" got started.

04:15.456 --> 04:18.724
So you've just written
this person out of your life?

04:18.726 --> 04:20.959
There's no coming back?
There's no second chances?

04:20.961 --> 04:22.861
That's how the goodsons work.
Eliminate the problem.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.496
Make 'em disappear.

04:24.498 --> 04:28.467
Dog chews the remote control,
next day, dog's gone.

04:28.469 --> 04:31.003
She calls your wife a moron,
sister's gone.

04:31.005 --> 04:34.273
Charlie, at some point
in your life,

04:34.275 --> 04:36.708
She'll be one of
the last people who
remembers your childhood.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.844
She'll be the only one
to share these memories with.

04:38.846 --> 04:41.013
So I guess you think
I should go to the baby shower

04:41.015 --> 04:42.848
And try to
patch things up.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.417
It's up to you,
but the next chance you get

04:45.419 --> 04:47.019
Will be at one
of your parents' funerals.

04:47.021 --> 04:48.754
You're right.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.956
I'll be too sad at my mom's,
and at my dad's,

04:50.958 --> 04:54.426
I'll be too busy playing
dance dance revolution
on his grave.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.962
Charlie,
I'm really proud of you.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.597
I'm proud of you, too.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.065
- For what?
- Going with me.

05:01.834 --> 05:03.435
Oh, no.

05:03.437 --> 05:05.404
Hey, I'm taking a trip
to anger trigger city.

05:05.406 --> 05:09.041
- I'm gonna need backup.
- I hate baby showers.

05:09.043 --> 05:10.542
I hate babies.

05:10.544 --> 05:13.445
They have no concept
of my importance.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.747
Well, maybe this will be
an enlightening experience
for you, too.

05:15.749 --> 05:18.817
- Besides, the baby's still
inside my sister.
- Oh, god.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.886
Just the thought of
a human being walking around

05:20.888 --> 05:24.423
With a giant parasite
inside them, it gives me
the creeps.

05:24.425 --> 05:27.326
Oh, yeah?
Wait till you hear
where it comes out.

05:30.596 --> 05:32.097
So far, so good.

05:32.099 --> 05:34.533
A little bit of anxiety
on the way to the baby shower,

05:34.535 --> 05:36.802
- But nothing
worth mentioning.
- Charlie, what are you doing?

05:36.804 --> 05:38.837
Giving you
a status report.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.906
You know,
passing time.

05:42.575 --> 05:44.910
We're going to be
in this car six hours.

05:44.912 --> 05:48.780
I don't need emotional traffic
updates on the 10s.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.582
This just in...

05:50.584 --> 05:53.852
A little bit of annoyance
in the driver's seat.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.687
You know what
annoys me most?

05:55.689 --> 05:59.358
Everyone at the baby shower's
gonna treat us like
we're a couple.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.959
What's wrong
with that?

06:00.961 --> 06:04.730
Who says we can't
do stuff together
and have fun?

06:04.732 --> 06:07.132
Couples don't have fun.

06:07.134 --> 06:10.669
They sit in a car
and make idle chitchat
and pass the time.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.838
And then they die.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.674
Oh, come on.
There's no reason
this can't be a good time.

06:15.676 --> 06:18.610
We're gonna have our meals
together, I got us a room.

06:18.612 --> 06:21.880
Room?
We're sleeping together?

06:21.882 --> 06:24.116
Do you want this
to get weird?

06:24.118 --> 06:27.686
How can sleeping
in a bed be weirder than
what we usually do in a bed?

06:27.688 --> 06:30.789
What we do is sex.
That's not weird.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.591
People do things
in their sleep.

06:32.593 --> 06:33.992
I remember my mom telling me

06:33.994 --> 06:36.828
How my dad used to fart
and cry in his sleep.

06:38.598 --> 06:41.032
Well, I promise
not to cry.

06:41.034 --> 06:44.903
See, we're already
starting down that bad road
toward being a couple.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.505
We're talking about farting.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.474
You know,
as the farting
increases,

06:49.476 --> 06:50.809
The sex decreases.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.978
Till you're just
two lonely people

06:52.980 --> 06:54.846
Lying at opposite ends
of the bed

06:54.848 --> 06:57.883
Farting at each other.

06:57.885 --> 07:00.118
Now I know why
he was crying.

07:02.655 --> 07:04.723
I'm just--
I'm really glad
you showed up.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.558
Well, whatever
the problem is,

07:06.560 --> 07:08.693
I don't want to hear
any gay details.

07:08.695 --> 07:10.996
No hand-holding,
no boy kissing,

07:10.998 --> 07:13.131
"why won't the government
let me get married?"

07:13.133 --> 07:15.600
I'll tell you why,
because they don't want

07:15.602 --> 07:17.436
You to have
the tax deduction.

07:17.438 --> 07:22.541
You people are industrious.
You're worth more to us single.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.676
Thanks, I guess.

07:24.678 --> 07:27.846
Okay, this-- all right,
this is a tricky conversation.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.214
I'm gonna stop you
right there.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.583
Don't tiptoe
or sashay or prance

07:31.585 --> 07:33.718
Or whatever you people do
around the subject.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.021
Just rip the band-aid off
and get right to it.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.924
- Your daughter's gay.
- ( laughs )

07:40.560 --> 07:42.060
Oh, my god.
You knew?

07:42.062 --> 07:45.096
Son, she's not gay.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.766
I'm laughing because

07:47.768 --> 07:49.634
I wish I had a nickel
for all the people

07:49.636 --> 07:51.603
Who came up to me
and told me that.

07:51.605 --> 07:54.039
Her kindergarten teacher,

07:54.041 --> 07:57.943
Her golf instructor,
the navy recruiter.

07:59.679 --> 08:01.680
Just because a girl's
a little different

08:01.682 --> 08:03.515
And not some frail
little thing

08:03.517 --> 08:05.717
And she's got her own ideas
about how to dress,

08:05.719 --> 08:07.719
People automatically assume

08:07.721 --> 08:10.088
That she plays
for the other team.

08:10.090 --> 08:13.558
Ed, she's the coach
of the other team.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.627
Hi, guys.
Need anything?

08:15.629 --> 08:17.796
I'll have
a miller on tap

08:17.798 --> 08:20.499
And oprah over here
will have a,

08:20.501 --> 08:22.167
What, a diet coke?

08:22.169 --> 08:25.003
I will have
a miller, too.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.671
- Lite, please.
- Okay.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.741
I bet people
have told you
you're a lesbian.

08:29.743 --> 08:32.944
Maybe when I was
back in college,

08:32.946 --> 08:35.680
And they'd be right,
but not recently, no.

08:35.682 --> 08:39.217
Unless this is some kind of
bass-ackwards way to see

08:39.219 --> 08:42.687
If I'm into crazy older dudes,
and I'm not there yet.

08:42.689 --> 08:45.824
I'm just making
a point here

08:45.826 --> 08:47.926
<i>That people naturally assume</i>

08:47.928 --> 08:51.196
That if a woman's strong
and independent, she's gay.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.665
Wow. I didn't see
that coming.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.800
Okay, I'll bang you.

08:57.837 --> 09:01.306
Well, she's got a nice swing
on her back porch. Whoo.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.608
Your daughter
would say that, too.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.277
She's a lesbian, ed.

09:05.279 --> 09:07.245
You met her
for two minutes.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.848
I'm her dad. What makes
you think you know her
better than I do?

09:09.850 --> 09:12.150
Okay, that's fair.
Does she date?

09:12.152 --> 09:15.253
Well, she's a busy girl.
She doesn't have time
for boys right now.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.756
She's got her job
in the daytime grooming dogs

09:17.758 --> 09:20.659
And at night she takes care
of maintenance at the pitch
and putt.

09:20.661 --> 09:24.229
Short of being a fluffer
for the indigo girls,

09:24.231 --> 09:27.332
I-- I don't know how
she could be any more gay.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.234
Now, I'm not saying this
to hurt you,

09:29.236 --> 09:32.337
It's just a vibe
that gay people are
sensitive to.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.706
And you think
I should go home

09:34.708 --> 09:37.676
And confront my daughter
based on some vibe
that you have?

09:37.678 --> 09:40.679
Okay, there is a one
in a million chance

09:40.681 --> 09:42.614
That I'm wrong,
but if I'm right,

09:42.616 --> 09:43.949
Your daughter
could be terrified

09:43.951 --> 09:45.784
Of what you might think
about her if she told you.

09:45.786 --> 09:48.653
Is that what you wanted
for your little girl

09:48.655 --> 09:50.655
When she was five years old
out in the backyard

09:50.657 --> 09:53.825
- Playing with her trucks?
- Damn it.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.727
Now you got me thinking.

09:55.729 --> 09:58.330
Here's your beers, guys.

09:58.332 --> 10:00.298
Hey, just curious.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.067
You're not wealthy
or anything, are you?

10:02.069 --> 10:05.003
Uh, nope.
I'm on a fixed income,

10:05.005 --> 10:08.707
But I do have
full medical.

10:08.709 --> 10:12.310
Oh, yeah. I just remembered,
I am still a lesbian.

10:17.883 --> 10:20.952
- I don't think I can do this.
- Don't set yourself up
for failure.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.221
She is probably
looking forward
to seeing you

10:23.223 --> 10:25.857
Because she's happy
about her stupid
little baby.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.993
I'm just not
real thrilled

10:27.995 --> 10:30.228
About meredith thinking
we're a couple.

10:30.230 --> 10:33.765
Kate, don't worry.
She'll be too busy ragging
on me to even notice you.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.834
( doorbell rings )

10:38.938 --> 10:41.740
- Hello, meredith.
- Oh.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.742
So you showed up.

10:43.744 --> 10:46.778
Bill, he's here.
I owe you 50 bucks.

10:47.847 --> 10:50.949
And, jennifer,
what happened to you?

10:51.717 --> 10:54.252
You used to be so cute.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.854
What'd you do
to your hair?

10:57.957 --> 11:00.825
Yeah, jennifer.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.362
Thank you so much.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.865
- You really didn't
have to make us a plate.
- No, you need to eat.

11:06.867 --> 11:09.234
You're like a stick
with an emo wig.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.405
And I still feel bad
about thinking you were jen.

11:13.407 --> 11:15.674
Oh, the stick thing
makes up for that.

11:17.777 --> 11:19.978
So why'd you hide
from me for 10 years?

11:19.980 --> 11:21.346
10 years?

11:21.348 --> 11:23.948
Boy, time goes by so fast

11:23.950 --> 11:25.917
When I'm not talking to you.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.420
Same old charlie.

11:28.422 --> 11:30.188
I'm sorry, meredith.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.058
You've displayed a lot
of emotional growth
by having me here.

11:33.060 --> 11:36.061
And I know that our dynamic
hasn't always been the best,

11:36.063 --> 11:38.396
But perhaps this is a chance
for us to get a fresh start

11:38.398 --> 11:40.331
At a good, healthy
sibling relationship.

11:40.333 --> 11:43.034
Ooh, somebody went
to the learning annex.

11:45.104 --> 11:48.139
I'm just saying I think
mom and dad set us up to compete
against each other.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.308
- We're both victims here.
- You know what,

11:50.310 --> 11:52.911
I'm glad you said that
because I don't wanna
fight anymore.

11:52.913 --> 11:56.114
You know, I'm trying to
get rid of all my anger
before the baby's born.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.783
You know,
managing anger
is my specialty.

11:58.785 --> 12:00.885
- I'm a therapist now.
- Don't make me laugh.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.888
I wouldn't let you
analyze my urine.

12:05.024 --> 12:07.826
Okay, that b.S. Might work
in la, but to me,

12:07.828 --> 12:10.128
You're just the thief
who stole my babysitting money.

12:11.464 --> 12:14.132
Wow, you remember everything
from our childhood.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.835
Hey, who knows?
Maybe in the future,

12:16.837 --> 12:19.971
We'll be able to download
all those memories and we
won't even need your head.

12:21.140 --> 12:23.041
Charlie, charlie,
come quick.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.343
They're about to play
"the newlywed game" with
the other couples.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.412
I hope we win, yay!

12:30.249 --> 12:32.317
- ( knocks on door )
- coming.

12:36.822 --> 12:38.890
I-- I need your help.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.825
Oh, my god.
You had the talk.
Is she okay?

12:40.827 --> 12:45.997
I've been with her all day
and I've tried to ask her it
about five times.

12:45.999 --> 12:49.100
- Where is she now?
- She's parking the car.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.302
Look, I need you
to talk to her.

12:51.304 --> 12:54.038
If she is a lesbian,

12:54.040 --> 12:56.541
Then you speak
the same language.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.510
It's all english, ed.

13:00.045 --> 13:02.947
Except that a queen is not
a member of the royal family

13:02.949 --> 13:06.985
And tops and bottoms
have nothing to do
with pajamas.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.853
- <i>( knocks on door )</i>
<i>- edie:</i> <i>Dad?</i>

13:08.855 --> 13:10.321
Wait, why does
she think she's here?

13:10.323 --> 13:13.124
I told her you were gay
and your toilet's broken.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.326
What, because I'm gay,
I can't fix my own toilet?

13:15.328 --> 13:17.095
- Well, can you?
- No.

13:17.097 --> 13:20.231
It's not because I'm gay,
it's because I'm spoiled.
Open the door.

13:22.067 --> 13:26.004
Hi, honey.
I jiggled the handle.
It's-- everything's fine now.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.106
Great.
Good to see
you again.

13:28.108 --> 13:31.242
Come on, dad. If we hurry,
we can still get down to
the work boot warehouse

13:31.244 --> 13:34.245
- Before it closes.
- Would you mind just

13:34.247 --> 13:37.148
Sitting down for a second?

13:37.150 --> 13:38.983
Your dad wants me
to talk to you.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.252
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

13:41.254 --> 13:45.023
Everything's fine
and it gets better.

13:47.259 --> 13:49.961
Now, this is
kind of awkward

13:49.963 --> 13:52.063
'cause I hardly know ya

13:52.065 --> 13:54.132
And I don't like
your father.

13:55.301 --> 13:58.036
But don't you think
it's probably time

13:58.038 --> 14:00.271
That you tell your dad
that you're a lesbian?

14:00.273 --> 14:03.141
Why would I do that?
I'm not gay.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.976
There,
what'd I tell ya?

14:04.978 --> 14:08.112
Come on, little ed.
Let's go get you a pair
of work boots.

14:08.114 --> 14:11.149
Wait a minute.
Come on, you've got
the uniform

14:11.151 --> 14:14.052
And the haircut.
The chain wallet.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.386
It is okay.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.188
This is something
that your dad needs
to deal with.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.424
Now just say it
with me.

14:19.426 --> 14:22.460
Dad, you made
a gay kid.

14:23.996 --> 14:26.264
I don't like girls.
I like boys.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.565
You tell him, honey.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.367
And I like my clothes.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.236
And I like my haircut.

14:31.238 --> 14:34.072
I don't look like a lesbian,
lesbians look like me.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.608
( laughs )
that's my girl!

14:36.610 --> 14:38.910
I've probably been with
more men than you have.

14:38.912 --> 14:42.113
- ( scoffs )
- I've been with more men
than anybody.

14:42.115 --> 14:46.084
- ( laughs )
- no, seriously, dad, like 100.

14:46.086 --> 14:49.087
- Wha-- what?
- I'm a grown woman.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.923
I don't tell you everything
I do and I wanna keep it
that way,

14:51.925 --> 14:55.193
But I guess you needed
to hear it.

14:55.195 --> 14:58.263
I like men...

14:58.265 --> 15:00.331
A lot.

15:06.238 --> 15:09.340
- You.
- I am so sorry, ed.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.976
I was just so excited
to rub your nose

15:11.978 --> 15:13.378
In the fact that
your daughter was gay

15:13.380 --> 15:16.648
That I totally missed
that she was a freak.

15:16.650 --> 15:19.384
I hope this doesn't trigger
any of your anger issues.

15:19.386 --> 15:22.120
No, like I said before,

15:22.122 --> 15:24.088
She just hadn't found
the right guy.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.623
Well, it's not
for lack of trying.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.062
Okay, girls.
Come take your seats.

15:31.064 --> 15:33.097
I hate these women.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.333
- What happened?
- Let me get you caught up.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.068
We're all very excited
about the shoe sale

15:37.070 --> 15:41.406
And all the girls
wanna know how much money
you give me for shopping.

15:41.408 --> 15:44.976
Oh, and did you know
jenny's husband pays her
for oral sex?

15:46.111 --> 15:47.378
Oh, and her name is...

15:47.380 --> 15:48.446
( high-pitched )
jenny.

15:51.216 --> 15:54.385
Okay. I asked the men--
according to your wife,

15:54.387 --> 15:58.323
What's the most romantic day
of the year for you?

15:58.325 --> 16:00.258
Let's start
with kayla and bob.

16:00.260 --> 16:04.062
- Our anniversary.
- Oh, bob said his birthday.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.130
- Kim?
- Valentine's day.

16:06.132 --> 16:09.400
Joe said his birthday.
Jenny?

16:09.402 --> 16:12.370
- Christmas.
- Oh, jenny.

16:14.006 --> 16:17.542
- Lou said his birthday.
- ( giggles )

16:17.544 --> 16:21.279
Oh, my god.
These guys only get laid
on their birthday?

16:21.281 --> 16:24.382
Jenny must be
making a fortune.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.484
- Kate?
- Um...

16:26.486 --> 16:28.419
December 21st.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.355
I don't know,
it's the longest night
of the year.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.724
More time to bang.

16:32.726 --> 16:37.462
Wow, charlie said
December 21st, too.

16:37.464 --> 16:40.431
- Oh, you said that?
- Is that your birthday,
charlie?

16:43.302 --> 16:46.337
No, I'm pretty sure
my birthday comes four
or five times a week.

16:47.406 --> 16:49.741
T.M.I.

16:49.743 --> 16:52.510
Okay, the second question
I asked is

16:52.512 --> 16:56.781
What will your partner say is
the perfect number of children?

16:56.783 --> 16:58.683
- Kayla?
- Five.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.752
Mm. Bob said four.

17:00.754 --> 17:03.421
But we already
have five.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.590
Joe and I talk
a lot about this.

17:05.592 --> 17:09.260
- I'm sure he said two.
- Joe said more than two.

17:11.463 --> 17:14.298
As many as the lord
will bless us with.

17:14.300 --> 17:18.503
- Lou said one.
- Oh, you went with a number?

17:20.305 --> 17:24.475
- Kate?
- I'm sure all your kids
are great

17:24.477 --> 17:27.445
And at least four
of yours,

17:27.447 --> 17:30.114
But I have to be honest,

17:30.116 --> 17:34.318
I don't like kids,
so I'm gonna have
to say zero.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.454
Wow, charlie said you'd say,

17:36.456 --> 17:38.523
"I don't like kids,
so I'll say zero."

17:39.525 --> 17:42.193
Why are we winning
this thing?

17:42.195 --> 17:44.362
Because we're not
a couple.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.631
We talk and actually listen
to each other.

17:46.633 --> 17:49.734
Oh, and I don't charge
a $100 entry fee.

17:51.503 --> 17:53.504
What do you mean
you don't like kids?

17:53.506 --> 17:56.507
I mean,
I think they're great

17:56.509 --> 17:58.309
If you have the time
for them.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.545
Oh, so you're one of those.

18:00.547 --> 18:03.414
- One of those?
- Last time I looked,
we were up two-zip.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.483
Let's play the game.

18:05.485 --> 18:08.152
You know, one of those women
who won't have kids

18:08.154 --> 18:11.089
Because she's too selfish
and she wants to be the center
of the universe.

18:11.091 --> 18:14.625
Selfish? I've dedicated
my life to helping people
every day.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.527
I just don't think
it's mandatory

18:16.529 --> 18:18.129
That I have
a tiny version
of myself

18:18.131 --> 18:20.431
To push into living out
my failed dreams.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.633
Kate does help people.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.869
Not by saying
things like that...

18:24.871 --> 18:27.672
But she is
a great therapist.

18:27.674 --> 18:30.441
Well, a woman's body
was made to have babies.

18:30.443 --> 18:33.578
Now hold on.
A woman can do whatever
she wants with her body.

18:33.580 --> 18:36.447
Kate might not be
making babies,
but trust me,

18:36.449 --> 18:40.151
She does use
her vagina for good.

18:40.153 --> 18:43.454
You know what,
maybe it's best that
you don't wanna be a mom.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.356
Excuse me?

18:45.358 --> 18:47.492
I mean,
I'd hate to be your kid.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.827
There's an anorexic
little drug problem
waiting to happen.

18:49.829 --> 18:52.897
Meredith,
you're so judgmental.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.133
Every time I bring somebody
around, you have to
start something.

18:55.135 --> 18:58.369
- What the hell
is wrong with you?
- No anger around the baby.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.304
Well, then you better
get it out of your body fast

19:00.306 --> 19:03.407
Because right now
it's swimming around in a pool
of "angryotic" fluid.

19:03.409 --> 19:05.643
What the hell
does that mean?

19:05.645 --> 19:09.380
I don't know.
You've been making me say things
I don't understand for 35 years.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.716
Charlie,
take a breath.

19:11.718 --> 19:14.418
You can either choose
to continue or walk away.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.787
You see that?
She'd be a great mom.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.523
That's the kind
of thing she'd say.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.791
Oh, and she'd keep her kid
from saying this--

19:20.793 --> 19:23.661
I'll see you
in another 10 years, bitch.

19:25.731 --> 19:28.599
Well, thank you for
the delightful pastries.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.601
We had a lovely time.

19:30.603 --> 19:33.204
May I take one
of these home?
All right.

19:36.575 --> 19:39.310
So are you ready
to talk about what
happened back there?

19:39.312 --> 19:41.879
I know, I know.
I played right
into her hands.

19:41.881 --> 19:44.749
I feel lousy
that when I'm old,

19:44.751 --> 19:46.951
I'm just gonna be
alone sitting in a rest home

19:46.953 --> 19:48.753
Desperately trying to recall

19:48.755 --> 19:50.955
Some happy memory
from my childhood.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.891
Yeah. Well, that's not
what I wanna talk about.

19:53.893 --> 19:57.728
Why in the world would you
feel the need to defend me?

19:57.730 --> 20:00.898
You're mad that
I defended you?

20:00.900 --> 20:04.402
I said good things
about your vagina.

20:04.404 --> 20:07.271
You acted like
we were a couple.

20:07.273 --> 20:09.874
That's why I didn't wanna stay
in the same hotel room,

20:09.876 --> 20:11.676
That's why I didn't wanna play
"the newlywed game,"

20:11.678 --> 20:14.745
And that's why
I didn't wanna go
to this damn baby shower!

20:14.747 --> 20:17.315
Yes, dear.

20:17.317 --> 20:18.916
Don't do that.

20:18.918 --> 20:21.953
Yes, dear.

20:21.955 --> 20:23.654
I am not messing around.

20:23.656 --> 20:27.425
We are not now,
nor will we ever be...
A couple.

20:27.427 --> 20:31.462
( both sigh )

20:31.464 --> 20:35.533
So you're not gonna pass
that truck? You're just stay
behind it for the next 75 miles?

20:37.269 --> 20:40.705
You really didn't like me
defending you?

20:40.707 --> 20:43.007
No, I did.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.842
That's why I didn't like it.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.845
And how did you feel
when we were winning
"the newlywed game"?

20:47.847 --> 20:51.015
Good.
That's why I hated it.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.384
You know one thing
couples never do?

20:53.386 --> 20:55.886
Die happy.

20:55.888 --> 20:58.756
Have sex in a car
on the side of a road.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.525
Yeah, that would
certainly make

21:01.527 --> 21:04.762
Two people
not a couple.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.365
What would you say
if I pulled over right here?

21:07.367 --> 21:10.601
I'd say happy birthday,
charlie.

21:11.970 --> 21:14.005
Give me 100 bucks.
