WEBVTT

00:09.403 --> 00:10.824
Y'all know what time it is?

00:11.051 --> 00:13.035
Time for me to change my shorts?

00:14.221 --> 00:16.221
No. It's time for...

00:16.309 --> 00:18.276
Friend-aversary!

00:20.729 --> 00:21.729
You guys...

00:21.754 --> 00:26.278
Look at her, just dying to
know what Friend-aversary is.

00:26.348 --> 00:27.715
Oh, let me guess.

00:27.766 --> 00:30.433
It's the anniversary
of the day you guys met.

00:34.543 --> 00:37.739
I think this calls for a
reenactment of the fateful day.

00:38.004 --> 00:39.753
Hank, would you like to set the scene?

00:39.778 --> 00:41.489
I don't think I really
need a reenactment...

00:41.514 --> 00:43.047
The year was 2016.

00:43.840 --> 00:46.598
Beyonc√© had just turned
lemons into <i>Lemonade.</i>

00:47.028 --> 00:50.121
North Korea was... doing they thing.

00:51.090 --> 00:53.551
Celebrities were dropping like flies.

00:54.145 --> 00:57.829
And Sidney Delacroix walked
into the Shady Meadow dining hall

00:57.865 --> 00:59.449
for the very first time.

01:00.551 --> 01:03.909
And it looked a little
something like this.

01:05.855 --> 01:07.512
Wherever will I,

01:07.711 --> 01:11.910
a killer candidate for
lifelong friendships, park it?

01:18.094 --> 01:22.043
Oh, no. David Bowie
and Prince, both dead.

01:23.124 --> 01:25.106
And my phone is dying, too.

01:26.512 --> 01:29.207
I think I have a charger
that you may borrow.

01:30.205 --> 01:31.496
No, I do not.

01:33.320 --> 01:36.262
Hey, kid, do you have a charger?

01:36.393 --> 01:40.074
<i>Moi?</i> I do have a phone charger. I do.

01:40.930 --> 01:44.392
Oh, boy, does thing
have a fast-forward?

01:47.101 --> 01:49.580
Cool. Would you like to sit with us?

01:49.933 --> 01:53.697
Out of all the people at Shady
Meadows, you chose me?

01:53.722 --> 01:57.064
I'm so honored, and I accept.

01:58.783 --> 02:01.003
- And that is how history was made.
- Yeah.

02:04.271 --> 02:06.409
Well, that was actually very sweet.

02:06.434 --> 02:10.502
It took a long, long time,
but it was very, very sweet.

02:11.932 --> 02:14.221
And, uh, I know exactly
what I'm gonna get you guys

02:14.246 --> 02:16.581
for anniversary presents:
acting lessons.

02:19.422 --> 02:22.976
So, for the anniversary
dinner tomorrow night,

02:23.259 --> 02:26.816
I'll kick things off
with three-layer dip,

02:27.045 --> 02:30.066
followed by thrice-baked potatoes,

02:30.218 --> 02:34.155
and then triple-fried 3 Musketeers bars!

02:35.620 --> 02:37.225
I really would like to
make fun of you guys,

02:37.250 --> 02:39.319
but it just keeps
getting cuter and cuter.

02:39.474 --> 02:41.459
So, I'm in.

02:41.484 --> 02:43.186
What's the dress code for the dinner?

02:43.345 --> 02:45.703
Well, your dress code gonna be
pajamas, 'cause you ain't coming.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.074

03:10.242 --> 03:12.782
So you are seriously
gonna have a special dinner

03:12.807 --> 03:16.110
about the friendships of this
table and not invite ya girl?

03:17.869 --> 03:20.219
We'd love to, but our hands are tied.

03:20.470 --> 03:22.633
See, the Founding Fathers
don't make the rules.

03:22.759 --> 03:25.516
Yes, they do. Of course they do.

03:25.615 --> 03:27.258
That's all they do!

03:29.411 --> 03:31.617
Well, I guess she's not gonna leave,

03:31.642 --> 03:33.571
so let's dive right in.

03:34.956 --> 03:37.821
The theme of this year's Friend-aversary

03:37.881 --> 03:39.664
is "Now and Then."

03:40.151 --> 03:41.884
This is us "Now."

03:42.287 --> 03:44.250
And this is us "Then."

03:45.666 --> 03:47.986
Oh, man, I got ripped.

03:49.891 --> 03:51.767
Okay, aren't we missing
something critical?

03:51.792 --> 03:53.002
I should be in the "Now" picture.

03:53.273 --> 03:55.258
Well, you were till I cut you out.

03:55.955 --> 03:58.735
It's amazing what you
can do with Photoshop.

03:59.502 --> 04:02.094
Plus, I gave us bulges.

04:06.237 --> 04:09.352
How are you a Founding
Father if Hank and Charlie

04:09.377 --> 04:11.938
were already friends
before you even sat down?

04:12.146 --> 04:14.242
Well, these guys, plus Jerry...

04:14.533 --> 04:16.202
R.I.P.

04:16.293 --> 04:20.719
They had had a few lunches,
but I was the special sauce

04:20.922 --> 04:23.758
that brought this table burger together.

04:23.783 --> 04:24.883
All right.

04:24.986 --> 04:26.485
Well, if you're the special sauce,

04:26.510 --> 04:28.039
I should at least be the pickles.

04:29.040 --> 04:30.914
Well, I couldn't have
said that better myself.

04:31.620 --> 04:36.078
And we all agree, burgers
are nasty with pickles.

04:38.017 --> 04:41.051
Nastier than three old
men with fake bulges?

04:41.133 --> 04:44.406
And by the way, you gave
yourself three balls, Sid.

04:50.683 --> 04:52.554
Okay, where were we?

04:52.797 --> 04:55.961
Now, I've taken care of the
music, the food, the decor.

04:56.170 --> 05:00.919
Let me show you what I'm thinking
about for the patio concept.

05:01.361 --> 05:03.677
Charlie, you did book
the patio, didn't you?

05:03.763 --> 05:07.216
Sid, I am offended that
you would even ask.

05:07.751 --> 05:09.459
That said, the answer is no.

05:11.485 --> 05:13.966
Come on, Charlie. You had one job.

05:13.991 --> 05:16.162
Relax. I'll reserve it now.

05:16.383 --> 05:17.422
Allison.

05:19.403 --> 05:20.640
Allison.

05:22.371 --> 05:23.371
Allison!

05:25.493 --> 05:26.755
What?

05:33.941 --> 05:37.177
Allison, we are hereby booking
the patio for tomorrow.

05:37.531 --> 05:39.746
Well, it delights me to tell you

05:39.771 --> 05:41.922
that the patio is already booked.

05:44.268 --> 05:46.630
Oh. Oh, am I smiling right now?

05:48.617 --> 05:50.599
I forgot what that feels like.

05:55.452 --> 05:57.013
Who booked the patio?

05:57.816 --> 06:00.209
The only people I like
less than you monsters:

06:00.639 --> 06:02.138
Judy and the cat ladies.

06:07.097 --> 06:09.435
Good luck convincing her
to give it to you, fellas.

06:18.609 --> 06:20.459
Well, the dinner's not dead.

06:21.323 --> 06:23.302
We can just have it in
one of our apartments.

06:23.327 --> 06:26.475
We have to have
Friend-aversary on the patio!

06:26.500 --> 06:27.881
It's tradition!

06:28.185 --> 06:31.194
Plus, it's gonna take me
24 hours just to decorate!

06:31.219 --> 06:33.514
What are we gonna do?!

06:36.086 --> 06:37.662
Thank you. I needed that.

06:39.405 --> 06:41.327
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

06:41.561 --> 06:44.741
That's Jason Bourne you're
about to punch, mister.

06:45.101 --> 06:46.842
Pipe down, Dudley.

06:47.092 --> 06:49.835
You talk to that book one more
time, I'm gonna make you eat it.

06:50.009 --> 06:52.194
Whoa, Mama's steaming from the hood.

06:52.567 --> 06:54.874
Any chance this venom
has something to do

06:54.899 --> 06:57.202
with the upcoming Friend-aversary?

06:58.858 --> 07:00.694
You know about Friend-aversary?

07:01.286 --> 07:03.381
Know about it? I lived it.

07:04.100 --> 07:05.827
And it haunts me to this day.

07:06.264 --> 07:07.421
Good-bye, Margaret.

07:07.771 --> 07:10.460
Wai... uh, Dudley, wait.
Don't go, don't go.

07:10.621 --> 07:12.155
W-What are you talking about?

07:12.236 --> 07:15.475
Oh. Usually, people want me to
leave after a couple sentences.

07:16.872 --> 07:20.389
Hank and Charlie asked me to
join their table before Sid.

07:20.639 --> 07:22.233
I was their first choice.

07:22.539 --> 07:23.838
Oh, Dudley,

07:23.976 --> 07:25.983
I don't mean to insult you, sweetie,

07:26.008 --> 07:28.275
but I find that very hard to believe.

07:28.443 --> 07:30.913
That's because you
didn't know me in 2016.

07:31.207 --> 07:33.803
I could drive at night,
and my knee didn't click.

07:35.116 --> 07:39.421
I was high on my own supply,
and I turned them down.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.639
So their whole Founding
Father story isn't true?

07:45.090 --> 07:46.288
Unbelievable.

07:46.401 --> 07:48.905
Turning them down is my greatest regret.

07:49.232 --> 07:52.341
Now all I dream about is
spending time with you guys.

07:52.366 --> 07:54.304
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's
great to dream, isn't it?

07:58.948 --> 07:59.948
Perfect.

08:05.145 --> 08:08.858
Sorry. Might want to try hanging
it a little higher next time.

08:09.952 --> 08:11.655
Or you might want to knock

08:11.822 --> 08:15.202
before blasting in like
the friggin' Kool-Aid Man!

08:16.592 --> 08:18.372
Sid, could you and I both agree

08:18.397 --> 08:20.697
that this whole Founding
Father thing is silly?

08:20.722 --> 08:22.059
Come on, let me come to the dinner.

08:22.174 --> 08:25.108
I would love to have you at the dinner.

08:25.442 --> 08:26.733
I really would.

08:26.916 --> 08:28.546
But you're not a Founding Father.

08:29.203 --> 08:32.270
Well, technically, neither are you.

08:33.943 --> 08:35.264
The heck you talking about?

08:35.654 --> 08:38.803
I know that you were not Hank
and Charlie's first choice

08:39.008 --> 08:40.342
to sit at the table.

08:40.678 --> 08:44.116
Oh, Margaret, what a sad lie.

08:46.163 --> 08:48.460
So desperate to get
past the velvet ropes,

08:48.634 --> 08:50.671
you'll say anything.

08:53.046 --> 08:54.979
Wait, did you not know?

08:56.506 --> 08:58.086
You mean it's true?

08:58.570 --> 09:01.601
But what about... the phone charger?

09:02.421 --> 09:04.147
What about the Founding Fathers?

09:05.242 --> 09:08.788
What about the special
sauce? It was all a lie?

09:08.901 --> 09:13.525
Wait... ooh. Whoa. Ow! Ow! Sid!

09:14.822 --> 09:17.322
Oh, sweet Margaret. Oh.

09:18.619 --> 09:21.301
I had the most terrible dream

09:21.326 --> 09:25.205
that all my best friendships
were based on a lie.

09:26.809 --> 09:28.009
It was real?

09:42.672 --> 09:43.673
Ooh.

09:47.399 --> 09:48.595
Oh, dear God.

09:49.401 --> 09:51.901
- Shut the door.
- Shut the door.

09:52.784 --> 09:56.198
Afternoon, uh, Judy, other cat ladies...

09:57.587 --> 09:58.604
... cats.

10:00.011 --> 10:02.831
Hank, what are you doing
here? You hate cats.

10:02.959 --> 10:05.042
What, us? What?!

10:05.445 --> 10:07.628
- Judy, you crazy.
- Yeah.

10:07.689 --> 10:11.003
Yeah, we think it's weird when
there's not 22 cats in a room.

10:13.371 --> 10:16.128
Listen, uh, Judy, we
need a favor, but first,

10:16.153 --> 10:17.362
we want to give you this little

10:17.387 --> 10:18.847
- token of our respect.
- Yeah.

10:19.012 --> 10:21.659
Primo catnip, and we
brought it for the cats...

10:21.684 --> 10:24.151
but, uh, there you go, she's eating it.

10:25.504 --> 10:26.605
So, uh,

10:26.941 --> 10:29.689
you guys booked the patio
for tomorrow, but, see,

10:29.723 --> 10:30.871
we need it for our

10:30.891 --> 10:32.246
- Friend-aversary dinner.
- Yeah.

10:32.342 --> 10:34.638
- Friend-aversary?
- Mm-hmm.

10:34.663 --> 10:36.327
That sounds ridiculous.

10:37.383 --> 10:39.505
Well, what are you using it for?

10:39.612 --> 10:41.378
Caturday Night Fever,

10:41.514 --> 10:44.435
a disco-themed dance party for cats.

10:44.898 --> 10:48.099
Great. And I can assume
none of you gals are married?

10:51.793 --> 10:54.466
This is kind of "Kevin's thing,"

10:54.491 --> 10:56.716
so you're gonna have to ask Kevin.

10:57.237 --> 10:59.732
Well, who the hell is Kevin?

11:04.772 --> 11:06.177
So, uh...

11:07.399 --> 11:08.497
what's up, Kevin?

11:08.568 --> 11:11.535
No, no, no, no, no. Face-to-face.

11:15.083 --> 11:17.050
Oh, man.

11:18.868 --> 11:20.567
Uh...

11:21.549 --> 11:24.332
Hey, there, uh... Kevin.

11:24.860 --> 11:26.199
You're looking good.

11:27.228 --> 11:30.251
Your fur is on point. What,
you been hitting the salmon?

11:32.100 --> 11:36.210
Listen, uh, it'd really
be great if you could

11:36.235 --> 11:39.405
let us have the patio tomorrow,

11:39.698 --> 11:41.694
so I can party with my friends.

11:43.954 --> 11:45.842
Are we waiting for him to answer or...?

11:46.379 --> 11:51.194
Oh, Kevin says he wants
a kiss to seal the deal.

11:51.707 --> 11:53.733
I ain't kissing no damn cat, man.

11:54.393 --> 11:55.928
Kiss the cat, Hank.

12:02.908 --> 12:04.295
Oh. Oh.

12:05.001 --> 12:07.467
The patio is yours, gentlemen.

12:07.567 --> 12:09.522
- Hot damn!
- You're the man, Kevin.

12:09.547 --> 12:10.639
All right.

12:10.693 --> 12:14.389
And now Kevin wants a kiss from mommy.

12:15.151 --> 12:16.764
Let's get the hell out of here.

12:19.555 --> 12:21.421
- Oh...
- Close the door.

12:22.026 --> 12:23.944
- Hey, Sid.
- Hey, Sid, great news.

12:24.203 --> 12:26.108
- Friend-aversary is on.
- Yeah.

12:26.322 --> 12:28.406
Friend-aversary is off!

12:28.709 --> 12:31.922
What are you talking about? I
just kissed a tuna-breath cat.

12:31.947 --> 12:33.726
I got whiskers in my teeth.

12:34.893 --> 12:36.788
Well, Margaret told me everything.

12:36.888 --> 12:39.742
I was your second choice
to sit at the table?

12:39.825 --> 12:42.226
Oh, Sid, it is no big deal.

12:42.251 --> 12:44.390
Just because we asked
Dudley before you...

12:44.415 --> 12:45.422
What?!

12:46.109 --> 12:48.906
You went to Dudley before me?!

12:49.111 --> 12:51.289
- What is happening right now?
- Oh, Sid,

12:51.314 --> 12:53.147
take it easy, okay? You're gonna faint.

12:53.346 --> 12:55.172
Oh, you would love that, wouldn't you?

12:55.668 --> 12:58.812
Well, I'm not gonna give
you the... satisfaction.

13:13.379 --> 13:15.562
Well, Margaret, you got what you wanted.

13:15.587 --> 13:17.172
You ruined Friend-aversary.

13:17.785 --> 13:19.398
What holiday you gonna ruin next?

13:19.487 --> 13:21.187
What, you gonna boil the Easter Bunny?

13:22.586 --> 13:24.219
You gonna kick Santa in the sack?

13:25.784 --> 13:27.875
Are you actually gonna blame this on me

13:27.951 --> 13:30.375
for telling Sid about
the lie that you told him

13:30.400 --> 13:33.067
two years ago that you
didn't tell me not to tell him

13:33.092 --> 13:35.179
that I didn't know was a
lie that he didn't know?

13:37.250 --> 13:38.969
She's trying to confuse us, Hank.

13:39.005 --> 13:40.219
Stand your ground.

13:41.313 --> 13:43.086
You know, lost in all
of this is the fact

13:43.111 --> 13:47.947
that I had to kiss a cat...
for nothing, because of you.

13:48.448 --> 13:50.437
I want to know who you gonna
kiss to make this right?

13:51.133 --> 13:55.078
'Cause it ain't gonna be me.
Sorry, I am not interested.

13:56.786 --> 14:00.758
'Sup, y'all? I'm just here
to set up for the party.

14:01.644 --> 14:02.644
Wait.

14:03.187 --> 14:04.714
Friend-aversary is on?

14:04.933 --> 14:07.433
You want me to go bring
the, uh, 3 Musketeerses?

14:09.385 --> 14:12.496
Oh, I'm not setting
up for Friend-aversary.

14:12.521 --> 14:15.347
I'm setting up for Caturday Night Fever.

14:16.752 --> 14:19.553
So once you get those 3 Musketeerseses,

14:20.088 --> 14:22.011
why don't you feed 'em to your butt?

14:24.391 --> 14:26.917
And, Margaret, would you
like to be my plus one?

14:26.942 --> 14:28.988
Oh, Sid, that sounds great

14:29.013 --> 14:32.917
because you know how much I
love being invited to stuff.

14:34.238 --> 14:37.527
So you're just gonna ditch us to
hang out with a bunch of cat ladies?

14:42.647 --> 14:44.909
Meow, meow, bitches.

15:03.418 --> 15:05.198
How fun is this?

15:05.223 --> 15:07.628
Yeah, I'm actually starting
to have a pretty good...

15:08.284 --> 15:09.956
Oh, this sucks, Sid.

15:10.808 --> 15:12.355
I mean, I know we're
trying to prove a point

15:12.380 --> 15:15.152
to Hank and Charlie,
but this is a freak show.

15:15.526 --> 15:17.995
- You don't even like cats.
- I love cats.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.855
I've never been happier,

15:20.023 --> 15:23.167
with the love of these
beautiful little crea...

15:23.485 --> 15:24.760
Ow!

15:24.840 --> 15:26.850
Damn you, you dick!

15:29.437 --> 15:31.147
We have so much fun together.

15:37.347 --> 15:38.917
- We don't need Sid.
- Mm-mm.

15:38.955 --> 15:40.683
We can throw our party without him.

15:41.336 --> 15:44.651
Although he does handle the
decorations, music and the food,

15:44.676 --> 15:47.511
it's really our stimulating conversation
that makes our party great.

15:52.573 --> 15:53.573
Yup.

15:57.427 --> 15:58.926
Oh, come on, Margaret.

15:59.040 --> 16:00.793
If we're not dancing,
it's gonna look like

16:00.818 --> 16:03.176
we're not having fun
to Hank and Charlie.

16:03.849 --> 16:05.142
Oh, Sid,

16:05.303 --> 16:07.168
you don't have to do this.

16:07.342 --> 16:08.808
I mean, is it really that big of a deal

16:08.833 --> 16:10.366
that you were their second choice?

16:10.454 --> 16:12.058
Yes, it is.

16:12.176 --> 16:16.980
When I walked up to that table,
I felt butterflies in my tummy,

16:17.036 --> 16:20.168
but to them, I was just some
rando with a phone charger.

16:20.414 --> 16:23.363
I realize now those
guys never felt about me

16:23.388 --> 16:25.347
the way that I felt about them.

16:26.406 --> 16:28.722
My heart is broken, Margaret!

16:35.309 --> 16:40.590
Guys, you really need Sid back,
and he definitely needs you.

16:40.873 --> 16:43.129
He thinks your whole
friendship isn't real

16:43.154 --> 16:44.683
because it started with a lie,

16:44.708 --> 16:47.019
so you need to prove to him
how important he is to you.

16:47.273 --> 16:48.884
Now, before you say
no, I just want you...

16:48.909 --> 16:50.051
We're in.

16:50.852 --> 16:52.418
Well, that was easy.

17:00.926 --> 17:02.112
I got your text.

17:02.859 --> 17:04.652
I'm still not speaking to you guys,

17:04.767 --> 17:07.501
but on the off chance
Bradley Cooper is really here...

17:09.484 --> 17:11.082
... you have my full attention.

17:12.318 --> 17:13.318
Places!

17:21.127 --> 17:22.301
"In the beginning,

17:23.060 --> 17:25.223
"Charlie and Hank
thought they were happy,

17:25.398 --> 17:26.669
but something was missing."

17:27.415 --> 17:31.052
"Hank, I think I'm happy,
but something is missing."

17:32.671 --> 17:34.763
"Should we let Dudley sit at our table?"

17:35.463 --> 17:37.974
"That's a stupid idea,
Charlie. You stupid."

17:40.228 --> 17:43.037
"But wait a minute. Look over there."

17:44.584 --> 17:45.716
- "Who."
- "Is."

17:45.744 --> 17:46.755
"That?"

17:49.614 --> 17:50.724
Oh!

17:54.513 --> 17:57.865
"I am Sidney Lafayette Delacroix,

17:58.142 --> 18:00.794
and I have nowhere to sit."

18:04.120 --> 18:08.177
"Maybe we should ask this
awesome guy to sit with us."

18:08.982 --> 18:10.791
"Now, wait a minute. That depends.

18:10.827 --> 18:13.357
"It's true, we have a seat at our table,

18:13.763 --> 18:15.863
"but before we ask you to sit with us,

18:16.122 --> 18:19.419
we have some questions.
Are you funny as hell?"

18:20.767 --> 18:21.767
"Yes."

18:23.802 --> 18:26.138
"Are you a wizard with a casserole?"

18:26.951 --> 18:27.974
"Yes."

18:29.879 --> 18:32.112
"And is your style always on point?"

18:32.140 --> 18:34.512
"Oh, friggin' hell yes!"

18:36.919 --> 18:38.693
"Well, then, please, have a seat."

18:44.583 --> 18:45.927
"Oh, no, Hank,

18:46.075 --> 18:49.341
what's that feeling in
my stomach? Bad clams?"

18:50.685 --> 18:52.935
"No, Charlie, those are butterflies.

18:53.659 --> 18:55.247
Friendship butterflies."

18:57.357 --> 19:00.622
You guys, you really mean all that?

19:00.929 --> 19:01.929
Sure do.

19:02.764 --> 19:06.513
You know, uh, something I never
told you about that day, Sid.

19:07.224 --> 19:09.099
When we were charging my phone,

19:09.124 --> 19:13.593
I kept unplugging it 'cause
I didn't want you to go.

19:16.392 --> 19:19.763
Yup, Charlie and I are
like two dying phones.

19:21.097 --> 19:23.097
And whenever our power gets too low,

19:23.132 --> 19:24.708
- 10% or below...
- Yeah.

19:26.547 --> 19:27.841
... you charge us up.

19:28.912 --> 19:31.185
You not only had a charger that day,

19:31.466 --> 19:33.192
- you were the charger.
- Oh.

19:34.363 --> 19:38.801
This is the sweetest thing
anybody has ever done for me.

19:39.528 --> 19:43.012
And, Margaret, I didn't
think I'd ever say this,

19:43.037 --> 19:46.598
but in some very odd way,
you're turning me on.

19:52.083 --> 19:54.895
Oh, uh, I'm really proud of
the three of you.

19:54.923 --> 19:56.825
Now could I please
take off this stupid wig

19:56.858 --> 19:59.059
and get these three tennis
balls out of my pants?

20:02.466 --> 20:05.049
Uh, well, our play's not over yet.

20:05.074 --> 20:06.747
- Um, Charlie.
- Oh.

20:08.681 --> 20:10.731
"'Cause even with the addition of Sid,

20:10.756 --> 20:13.926
the third piece of the group
still was not complete."

20:14.183 --> 20:15.630
What are you guys talking about?

20:16.206 --> 20:18.503
"Hi, I'm Margaret.

20:23.410 --> 20:27.410
I'm going to sit here,
whether you like it or not."

20:29.122 --> 20:32.090
Aw! You guys included me.

20:32.827 --> 20:35.212
"On first impression, I do not like you,

20:35.237 --> 20:36.778
but you will grow on me."

20:37.998 --> 20:40.349
"You're going to grow
on all of us. That's right.

20:40.531 --> 20:42.341
"You're the new chapter of our story.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.983
We're sorry we didn't include you."

20:45.039 --> 20:46.866
"I'm lucky to be in this amazing group,

20:47.551 --> 20:50.561
considering I'm a huge pain in the ass."

20:54.062 --> 20:55.842
- Hank wrote the script.
- Yes.

20:56.485 --> 20:57.795
I figured.

20:58.020 --> 20:59.100
The end.

21:01.368 --> 21:03.842
Margaret, this is your official invite

21:03.963 --> 21:05.569
to the Friend-aversary dinner.

21:05.594 --> 21:08.545
Oh, well, I'll think about it. I'm in.

21:09.335 --> 21:10.623
Can I come, too?

21:10.945 --> 21:13.483
Go hang with the cat ladies, Dudley!

21:15.059 --> 21:17.631
I wish. Too much bad blood.

21:17.909 --> 21:21.127
I really ran through
those broads back in 2016.
