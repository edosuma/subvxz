WEBVTT

00:06.507 --> 00:08.676
OKAY, YOUR MISSION SUPPLIES
ARE PACKED,

00:08.709 --> 00:11.545
THE SCHEMATICS
HAVE BEEN UPLOADED
INTO CHASE'S CHIP,

00:11.579 --> 00:14.582
AND YOUR TRANSPORT
IS ON THE WAY.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.617
DID I FORGET ANYTHING?

00:16.650 --> 00:19.420
NO. WE'LL JUST GUESS
WHAT THE MISSION IS

00:19.453 --> 00:21.289
AND SEE HOW
IT ALL PLAYS OUT.

00:21.322 --> 00:24.558
ALL RIGHT. A PARTICLE COLLIDER
IS A THREE-MILE LONG

00:24.592 --> 00:27.027
UNDERGROUND FACILITY
WHERE SCIENTISTS--

00:27.061 --> 00:29.663
RACE SUBATOMIC PARTICLES
AT EACH OTHER AT LIGHT SPEED

00:29.697 --> 00:32.031
FOR ENERGY EXPERIMENTS.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.667
(giggI KNOW. COOL!

00:33.701 --> 00:35.403
Both:
DEEDLE-DEEDLE-DEE!

00:37.037 --> 00:39.039
THERE IS A PARTICLE COLLIDER
IN BERKELEY

00:39.073 --> 00:41.275
THAT IS ACCELERATING
OUT OF CONTROL,

00:41.309 --> 00:44.212
AND YOUR MISSION
IS TO SHUT IT DOWN.

00:44.245 --> 00:45.713
OH HO! AWESOME!

00:45.746 --> 00:48.416
I HOPE ONE OF US
KNOWS HOW TO DO THAT.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.384
OKAY. WE HAVE TO
ACT QUICKLY.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.052
THE SCIENTISTS THAT
OPERATE THE FACILITY--

00:52.086 --> 00:53.721
'SCUUUUSE ME--

00:53.754 --> 00:56.490
HAVE ALREADY EVACUATED
THE CONTROL CENTER,

00:56.524 --> 00:58.226
AND IF WE DON'T
SHUT IT DOWN IN TIME,

00:58.259 --> 01:00.361
IT WILL CREATE
A MASSIVE BLACK HOLE

01:00.394 --> 01:02.496
THAT WILL IMPLODE
THE ENTIRE PLANET.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.266
TODAY?!

01:05.299 --> 01:07.135
NO, THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.103
TODAY IS SHELLY EVANS' BIRTHDAY,

01:09.137 --> 01:11.472
AND HER MOM MAKES
THE BEST CUPCAKES!

01:13.574 --> 01:18.512
I'M JUST SAYIN'.
THAT WOMAN DOESN'T SKIMP
ON THE SPRINKLES.

01:18.546 --> 01:21.315
DON'T WORRY, LEO,
YOU WILL GET YOUR CUPCAKES.

01:21.349 --> 01:24.485
ADAM, BREE AND CHASE HAVE
ALL THE TRAINING THEY NEED

01:24.518 --> 01:26.387
TO SHUT THE COLLIDER DOWN.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.588
I DON'T KNOW, BIG D.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.523
I THINK THESE GUYS ARE
GONNA NEED SOME...

01:29.557 --> 01:30.758
* BACK-UP!

01:32.126 --> 01:33.661
YEAH, AND THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE GONNA BE

01:33.694 --> 01:36.630
* BACK UP! HERE
IN THE LAB WITH ME.

01:36.664 --> 01:40.434
OH, HE SAID "BACKUP"
AND YOU SAID "BACKUP."

01:40.468 --> 01:42.270
SAYING THINGS TWICE
MAKES IT FUNNY!

01:42.303 --> 01:43.571
OH! SAYING THINGS TWICE
MAKES IT FUN--

01:43.604 --> 01:44.705
STOP IT!

01:46.674 --> 01:49.710
Man: NO, NO, NO!!!!

01:49.743 --> 01:50.844
AAAAH!

01:50.878 --> 01:54.515
AAAAAH!

01:56.150 --> 01:57.418
NOBODY PANIC!

01:57.451 --> 01:59.587
PROBABLY JUST
THE CABLE GUY.

01:59.620 --> 02:04.358
COME ON, BIG D,
I JUST CAME FROM
SEVEN YEARS IN THE FUTURE.

02:04.392 --> 02:06.727
YOUR TIME MACHINE
ACTUALLY WORKED!

02:06.760 --> 02:09.363
IT'S ME! LEO!

02:09.396 --> 02:11.732
WHOA!

02:11.765 --> 02:14.235
THE CABLE GUY'S GOT
THE SAME NAME AS YOU!

02:16.470 --> 02:18.772
WAIT. IF YOU'RE REALLY ME,

02:18.806 --> 02:20.641
THEN YOU'D KNOW THE HANDSHAKE
I CAME UP WITH

02:20.674 --> 02:22.743
IN CASE I EVER
BECAME A SPY.

02:22.776 --> 02:25.479
REQUESTING AUTHENTICATION,
DOUBLE-O LEO.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.756
IT REALLY IS ME!

02:35.789 --> 02:38.792
Narrator:
 THE WORLD'S FIRST
 BIONIC SUPERHUMANS--

02:38.826 --> 02:42.896
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,
 FASTER, SMARTER.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.766
THE NEXT GENERATION
 OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

02:45.799 --> 02:47.768
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?!

02:47.801 --> 02:50.571
**

03:25.673 --> 03:27.775
SO YOU'RE...

03:27.808 --> 03:32.212
THE FUTURE VERSION
OF HIM.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.414
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS MEANS?

03:33.447 --> 03:36.350
I CRACKED TIME TRAVEL!

03:36.384 --> 03:39.787
HA HA HA!
* I CRACKED TIME TRAVEL,
I CRACKED TIME-- *

03:39.820 --> 03:41.789
CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR?
WHEN I SEE YOU IN SEVEN YEARS

03:41.822 --> 03:44.625
CAN YOU REMIND ME TO TELL ME
HOW AWESOME I AM?

03:44.658 --> 03:47.595
LEMME HIGH-FIVE.
LIKE THAT.

03:47.628 --> 03:50.698
Both:
OH, I'M SURE YOU WON'T FORGET.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.666
HEY, HE JUST SAID
WHAT I SAID!

03:52.700 --> 03:55.469
TECHNICALLY, I JUST
SAID WHAT I SAID.

03:55.503 --> 03:57.938
OKAY, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO STOP DOING THAT.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.573
STOP. STOP.

03:59.607 --> 04:00.774
STOP!

04:02.543 --> 04:05.245
IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU GUYS!

04:05.279 --> 04:07.415
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU TOO...

04:07.448 --> 04:10.884
OLDER, YET
STRANGELY SIMILAR LEO.

04:12.820 --> 04:15.456
SO, UH...(chuckles)...

04:15.489 --> 04:17.358
WHAT DID TIME TRAVEL FEEL LIKE?

04:17.391 --> 04:20.260
DID YOUR BODY MASS
INCREASE EXPONENTIALLY

04:20.293 --> 04:22.396
AS YOU ACCELERATED
TOWARDS LIGHT SPEED?

04:22.430 --> 04:23.964
UH, I PUSHED THE BUTTON,

04:23.997 --> 04:25.966
FELT A LOT OF WIND,
THERE WAS A BIG FLASH--

04:25.999 --> 04:28.536
BUT YEAH,
MASS AND SPEED STUFF.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.873
SO IF YOU'RE
FROM THE FUTURE...

04:32.906 --> 04:35.376
THEN WHAT COLOR
ARE MY EYES?

04:37.478 --> 04:39.480
IGNORE HIM.

04:39.513 --> 04:40.948
COME ON, FUTURE LEO,

04:40.981 --> 04:44.352
LET'S JUMP TO 2025
AND SEE WHAT PEOPLE ARE WEARING.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.387
I WANT TO START NOW
AND BE A TREND-SETTER.

04:46.420 --> 04:49.723
SORRY, BUT IT TOOK BIG D
YEARS TO JUST SCRAPE TOGETHER

04:49.757 --> 04:52.460
ENOUGH ZANOL FUEL
FOR ME TO COME HERE ONCE
AND GO BACK.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.328
OHH. FINE.

04:54.362 --> 04:56.797
BUT IF I END UP
WEARING MOM JEANS
AND HAIR SCRUNCHIES,

04:56.830 --> 04:59.900
YOU ARE GONNA GET BACK
IN THAT THING AND FIX IT.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.469
( cell phone buzzing )

05:01.502 --> 05:03.904
OH. THE COLLIDER MISSION.
YOU GUYS HAVE TO GET READY.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.873
HEAD TO THE EQUIPMENT ROOM
AND GEAR UP.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.475
NICE TO MEET YOU,
FUTURE LEO!

05:07.508 --> 05:10.678
CONGRATS ON GROWING
OUT OF YOUR AWKWARD STAGE!

05:12.546 --> 05:16.016
HEY, WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST BRING
FUTURE ADAM, BREE AND CHASE
WITH YOU?

05:16.049 --> 05:19.587
LET ME GUESS. YOU JUST
HOPPED IN THE TIME MACHINE
AND TOOK OFF WITHOUT THEM.

05:19.620 --> 05:22.556
THAT IS SO FUTURE ME.

05:22.590 --> 05:26.059
ACTUALLY...
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.562
ADAM, BREE AND CHASE...

05:28.596 --> 05:30.831
DON'T MAKE IT TO THE FUTURE.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.433
Adam: OH, NO!

05:32.466 --> 05:34.502
OH, NO! OH, NO!

05:35.736 --> 05:38.372
FORGOT TO PACK MY PUDDING.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.077
WHAT DO YOU MEAN

05:44.111 --> 05:47.581
ADAM, BREE AND CHASE
DON'T MAKE IT TO THE FUTURE?

05:47.615 --> 05:51.819
YOU SENT ME BACK HERE
WITH A VIDEO THAT WILL
EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.422
( beeping, whirring )

05:54.455 --> 05:55.923
WHOA, WHAT IS THAT?

05:55.956 --> 05:57.357
IT'S A HOLOPHONE.

05:57.391 --> 06:00.093
I INVENTED THE HOLOPHONE?

06:00.127 --> 06:03.464
NO. BUT YOU DID
WAIT IN LINE SIX DAYS
TO GET ONE.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.836
GREETINGS, PAST DONALD.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.038
THAT'S ME?

06:11.071 --> 06:13.741
PLEASE TELL ME THE HOLOPHONE
ADDS A HUNDRED POUNDS.

06:13.774 --> 06:17.545
EVEN IF IT DID,
 WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER
 TWO HUNDRED?

06:18.879 --> 06:21.615
THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS
ARE PRETTY HARD ON YOU,
BIG D.

06:21.649 --> 06:25.352
(snickers)
OR SHOULD I SAY
"BIGGER" D?

06:25.385 --> 06:28.155
( laughing )

06:29.590 --> 06:31.792
IF YOU ARE WATCHING THIS,

06:31.825 --> 06:33.894
WE CRACKED TIME TRAVEL!

06:33.927 --> 06:36.997
HA HA! INTER-DIMENSIONAL
 HIGH FIVE.

06:38.866 --> 06:41.368
I JUST HIGH-FIVED
MY FUTURE SELF!

06:41.401 --> 06:43.537
WHAT?! LOOK AT ME!

06:43.571 --> 06:45.706
LET ME HAVE SOME JOY.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.008
I SENT LEO BACK IN TIME

06:48.041 --> 06:50.711
TO STOP YOU FROM
 SENDING ADAM, BREE AND CHASE

06:50.744 --> 06:52.613
ON THE PARTICLE COLLIDER
 MISSION.

06:52.646 --> 06:53.847
WHAT? WHY?

06:53.881 --> 06:56.383
NOW, I'M SURE YOU'RE ASKING,
 "WHAT? WHY?"

06:56.416 --> 07:00.754
I KNOW MYSELF SO WELL.
YOU KNOW.

07:00.788 --> 07:04.057
AS A SCIENTIST,
 I AM LOATH TO CHANGE THE PAST.

07:04.091 --> 07:08.662
BUT IN THIS CASE, I HAVE
 TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION.

07:08.696 --> 07:12.666
ADAM, BREE AND CHASE...
 DON'T RETURN FROM THE MISSION.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.636
SEND AN AUTOMATED ROVER
 IN THEIR PLACE.

07:15.669 --> 07:18.939
IT'S THE ONLY CHANCE WE HAVE
 TO SAVE THEM.

07:18.972 --> 07:21.675
OH, AND BY THE WAY--
 (clears throat)--

07:21.709 --> 07:24.745
EVERY TIME YOU SAY,
 "HEY, I THINK THIS CALLS
 FOR A COOKIE,"

07:24.778 --> 07:26.079
THINK ABOUT THIS.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.616
AAAAH!

07:28.649 --> 07:31.585
( shouting, whimpering )

07:33.220 --> 07:36.156
HOW COULD I
SEND THEM ON A MISSION
THEY DON'T RETURN FROM?

07:36.189 --> 07:37.791
AND HOW COULD YOU
LET YOUR HAIR RECEDE

07:37.825 --> 07:40.594
WITH SO MANY TRUSTED
OVER-THE-COUNTER REMEDIES
AVAILABLE?

07:40.628 --> 07:43.797
IF ADAM, BREE OR CHASE
HEAR ANY OF THIS,

07:43.831 --> 07:47.167
IT'LL SHAKE THEIR CONFIDENCE
IN FUTURE MISSIONS OR
THEIR CONFIDENCE IN ME.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.737
PLEASE TELL ME YOU WON'T
SAY ANYTHING TO THEM.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.905
I PROMISE.

07:51.939 --> 07:55.809
FUTURE ME...
SPEAKS FOR BOTH OF US.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.645
THERE'S NOT MUCH TIME.

07:57.678 --> 08:00.480
THE COLLIDER SITUATION'S
GETTING WORSE BY THE HOUR.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.850
I GOTTA GO
BUILD THAT ROVER.

08:02.883 --> 08:04.952
WE'RE GOOD TO GO,
MR. DAVENPORT.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.621
WE'LL CHECK IN ONCE
WE REACH NO!TA POINT.

08:07.655 --> 08:10.558
UH, I-I MEAN,
THE MISSION'S OFF.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.760
BUT YOU SAID
IT WAS URGENT.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.227
DID I SAY "URGENT"?

08:14.261 --> 08:16.997
I TH-- I THINK
I SAID "URGE...ING."

08:17.030 --> 08:20.167
I WAS LIKE I WAS URGING YOU
 NOT TO GO ON THE MISSION.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.570
WHY?

08:22.603 --> 08:24.237
BECAUSE I'M SENDING
AN AUTOMATED ROVER

08:24.271 --> 08:26.707
THAT CAN SHUT DOWN THE COLLIDER
VIA REMOTE. (coughs)

08:26.740 --> 08:28.475
AS SOON AS I BUILD IT.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.711
AN AUTOMATED ROVER?

08:30.744 --> 08:33.179
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
SEND A HANDBAG
ON A SKATEBOARD.

08:33.212 --> 08:34.847
THE THREE ONO!!!CAN HANDLE--

08:34.881 --> 08:36.817
I SAID NO,
AND I MEAN IT!

08:36.850 --> 08:39.587
MY DECISION IS FINAL.
NOW JUST...

08:39.620 --> 08:41.254
EVERYBODY GO
GET READY FOR SCHOOL.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.898
THANK YOU.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.934
FUTURE YOU WOULD
THANK YOU TOO, BIG D.

08:53.967 --> 08:57.771
OR SHOULD WE SAY
"BALD"-D?

08:57.805 --> 08:59.840
( both laughing )

09:04.177 --> 09:07.280
SO, YOU KNOW EVERYTHING
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?

09:07.314 --> 09:10.684
NOT EVERYTHING.
LITTLE STUFF CAN CHANGE
WITHOUT AFFECTING THE BIG STUFF.

09:10.718 --> 09:11.885
FOR EXAMPLE...

09:14.321 --> 09:16.590
LAST TIME THAT WAS YOU.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.659
SMELLED LIKE KIWI
FOR A WEEK.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.163
JANELLE!

09:25.132 --> 09:27.167
OH, THAT'S JUST PAINFUL.

09:28.636 --> 09:31.004
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S
COMING YOUR WAY, DO YOU?

09:31.038 --> 09:32.706
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

09:32.740 --> 09:35.609
YOU'LL SEE...
AT 8:27.

09:35.643 --> 09:37.945
WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN
HEY, LEO!

09:37.978 --> 09:38.979
HEY, JANELLE!!!

09:39.012 --> 09:41.649
SO, WHO'S YOUR FRIEND?

09:41.682 --> 09:43.216
OH, THAT'S ME.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.653
OH....

09:45.686 --> 09:47.020
"MEO."

09:47.054 --> 09:49.890
MY COUSIN MEO!

09:49.923 --> 09:51.992
IT'S SHORT FOR MEOPOLD.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.662
"MEO AND LEO."

09:54.695 --> 09:56.830
THAT DOESN'T SOUND
MADE UP AT ALL.

09:56.864 --> 09:58.565
HA HA HA HA!

09:58.598 --> 10:00.033
HA HA--

10:01.935 --> 10:03.804
SO, ANYWAYS,

10:03.837 --> 10:06.874
UH, LEO,
DO YOU WANT TO SEE
A MOVIE TONIGHT?

10:11.311 --> 10:13.914
DID SHE JUST--?
AND YOU KNEW--?

10:13.947 --> 10:15.348
8:27!

10:17.685 --> 10:20.120
YES. YEP. DONE.
TOTALLY. TOAST MY GOATS.

10:20.153 --> 10:23.123
I'LL SEE YOU THERE
AT SEVEN.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.296
THINGS ARE GONNA GO
REALLY WELL TONIGHT.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.631
CHECK IT OUT.

10:31.665 --> 10:33.834
THAT'S YOU TWO
IN SEVEN YEARS.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.235
PRETTY COOL, HUH?

10:35.268 --> 10:36.970
ARE YOU WEARING
A PINK TIE?

10:37.004 --> 10:39.773
IT WAS A GIFT FROM JANELLE,
AND WE LOVE IT.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.614
HEY, BIG D.
I GOT AN "A"
ON MY HISTORY TEST.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.417
YEAH? DID YOU CHEAT
BY GETTING THE ANSWERS
FROM FUTURE YOU?

10:52.119 --> 10:54.822
Both: SO, HOW'S THAT ROVER
COMING ALONG?

10:54.855 --> 10:56.824
IT'S ALMOST READY.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.759
( crackling, small explosion )

10:58.792 --> 11:00.093
YOU KNOW WHAT,

11:00.127 --> 11:02.830
ARE YOU SURE ADAM, BREE
AND CHASE DON'T MAKE IT?

11:02.863 --> 11:04.732
YES, I'M SURE.
I'LL SHOW YOU.

11:04.765 --> 11:07.701
WE DOWNLOADED
THE SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE
FROM THE CONTROL ROOM.

11:09.903 --> 11:12.405
( alarm wailing )

11:12.439 --> 11:15.909
( whooshing;
 powering down )

11:15.943 --> 11:19.780
WELL--
THEY SHUT IT DOWN.
THEY COMPLETED THEIR MISSION.

11:19.813 --> 11:24.818
YOU CAME BACK FOR NOTHING.
I THINK THIS CALLS FOR A COOKIE.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.353
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
THE ENDING.

11:26.386 --> 11:27.988
( cheering, whooping )

11:28.021 --> 11:30.858
( alarm resumes wailing )

11:30.891 --> 11:33.160
( crashing, explosions )

11:35.195 --> 11:37.430
SCRATCH THAT COOKIE.
( sighs )

11:37.464 --> 11:39.066
I GOTTA GET THIS THING
MISSION-READY.

11:39.099 --> 11:42.369
AHA! SO IT'S STILL
NOT MISSION-READY.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.337
WHY WON'T YOU JUST
LET US GO?

11:44.371 --> 11:46.139
NO, NO, THAT WON'T
BE NECESSARY.

11:46.173 --> 11:49.309
I JUST NEED TO BUY
A FEW THINGS...FROM NASA.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.945
THEY'RE HAVING A SALE.
EVERYTHING'S A MILLION OFF.

11:51.979 --> 11:55.816
I'LL BE GONE
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.
LEO, YOU'RE IN CHARGE.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.818
Both:
YOU FUTURE LEO.G D.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.920
AW, COME ON!

12:01.354 --> 12:03.791
HE THINKS THIS MISSION'S
TOO BIG FOR US.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.927
IT'S NOT THAT
HE LEO. WE PROMISED.IG--

12:06.960 --> 12:10.063
I GUESS DAVENPORT JUST
LOST CONFIDENCE IN US.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.800
OR HE LOST CONFIDENCE
IN YOU TWO.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.835
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

12:14.868 --> 12:16.837
YEAH, I'M THE ONE
 ALWAYS CARRYING YOU TWO.
 YOU'RE THE WEAK LINKS.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.738
OH, I'MMM-HMM.AK LINK?

12:18.772 --> 12:21.308
YOU CAN'T EVEN SPELL
"WEAK LINK."

12:21.341 --> 12:22.910
CAN TO.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.846
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!

12:25.879 --> 12:28.281
GUY( arguing )YS!

12:29.316 --> 12:31.051
ENOUGH!

12:31.084 --> 12:33.954
FUTURE ME CAME HERE
TO WARN DAVENPORT NOT TO
LET YOU GO ON THE MISSION

12:33.987 --> 12:35.889
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
COME BACK FROM IT.

12:35.923 --> 12:39.126
GOD! I NEVER
LISTEN TO MYSELF!

12:39.159 --> 12:41.862
DON'T COME BACK?

12:41.895 --> 12:43.864
WOW.

12:43.897 --> 12:47.400
I GUESS THIS MEANS
WE'RE...NOT INVINCIBLE.

12:49.169 --> 12:51.839
IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW.

12:51.872 --> 12:54.808
THIS IS WHY MR. DAVENPORT
FORBADE US TO GO.

12:54.842 --> 12:57.177
NICE GOING.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.079
I HAD TO TELL THEM.

12:59.112 --> 13:02.015
DAVENPORT DIDN'T WANT TO
UNDERMINE THEIR CONFIDENCE,

13:02.049 --> 13:05.352
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT HE DID
BY NOT TELLING THEM.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.888
DON'T YOU SHAKE MY HEAD AT ME.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.862
HEY! HEY.

13:14.895 --> 13:17.797
CAREFUL.
HANDSOME IS DELICATE.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.437
SHOULD I REALLY BE GOING
TO A MOVIE WITH JANELLE

13:24.471 --> 13:28.041
CONSIDERING THERE STILL
MIGHT BE A SLIGHT CHANCE
THE EARTH MIGHT IMPLODE?

13:28.075 --> 13:30.443
WELL, IT IS
A PRETTY GOOD MOVIE.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.986
IT'S A NOTE FROM
ADAM, BREE AND CHASE.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.989
THEY WENT WHAT?! MISSION!

13:42.022 --> 13:44.925
"DEAR MR. DAVENPORT,
WE WENT TO STOP THE COLLIDER.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.794
"WE KNOW WE WON'T
MAKE IT BACK, BUT THAT'S
A SMALL PRICE TO PAY

13:47.827 --> 13:50.163
"TO SAVE YOU, LEO
AND THE REST OF THE WORLD.

13:50.197 --> 13:53.200
P.S. SORRY WE GET
BLOWNED UP."

13:53.233 --> 13:56.569
PRETTY SURE ADAM
WROTE THAT LAST PART.

14:03.443 --> 14:06.546
WE HAVE TO TELL DAVENPORT
ABOUT ADAM, BREE AND CHASE
ON THE MISSION.

14:06.579 --> 14:09.983
WHAT?O. IT'S HAPPENING.

14:10.017 --> 14:12.385
THE SERIES OF EVENTS I WAS
SENT BACK HERE TO PREVENT.

14:12.419 --> 14:15.122
Donald's voicemail:
 YOU MISSED ME,
 BUT LEAVE A MESSAGE

14:15.155 --> 14:18.358
FOR DAVENPORT, DAVENPORT,
 DAVENPORT INDUSTRIES!

14:18.391 --> 14:20.027
( beep )

14:20.060 --> 14:23.330
IT'S THE SAME AWFUL VOICEMAIL
FOR THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS!

14:24.998 --> 14:27.901
I CAN'T IMAGINE MY LIFE
WITHOUT ADAM, BREE AND CHASE.

14:27.935 --> 14:30.470
I DON'T HAVE TO IMAGINE IT--
I LIVED IT, AND IT'S AWFUL.

14:30.503 --> 14:34.207
DAVENPORT IS SO DISTRAUGHT
HE SPENDS THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS
TRYING TO BUILD A TIME MACHINE

14:34.241 --> 14:36.910
SO HE CAN STOP THIS ONE EVENT
AND GET THEM BACK.

14:41.581 --> 14:44.317
WHY DIDN'T HE JUST
COME HERE HIMSELF?

14:44.351 --> 14:46.886
I DON'T WANT TO BORE YOU
WITH THE TIME TRAVEL DETAILS,

14:46.920 --> 14:49.489
BUT MASS PLAYS INTO
THE CALCULATIONS,

14:49.522 --> 14:53.226
AND HE DID NOT WANT TO
WRITE DOWN HIS WEIGHT
IN FRONT OF ME.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.928
HE DIDN'T FIT INTO
THE TIME MACHINE?

14:54.962 --> 14:57.364
YOU SAW THAT MAN.
HE DOESN'T FIT INTO ANYTHING.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.602
( alarm wailing )

15:06.639 --> 15:10.443
OH, IT'S REDLINING!
ADAM, BUST OPEN
THAT CONTROL PANEL.

15:13.613 --> 15:16.583
OKAY. BREE, RUN TO THE COLLIDER
AND USE YOUR SUPER-SPEED

15:16.616 --> 15:18.986
TO CREATE A VACUUM
TO SLOW THAT THING DOWN.

15:19.019 --> 15:22.022
OH, SURE. GIVE THE GIRL
THE VACUUMING JOB.

15:22.055 --> 15:23.590
WOULD YOU JUST GO?!

15:26.026 --> 15:28.028
GREAT.

15:30.163 --> 15:33.133
WOW.
SO, I GUESS THIS IS IT.

15:34.534 --> 15:37.971
YEAH.
LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT IT.

15:38.005 --> 15:39.973
YOU KNOW WHAT
I JUST REALIZED?

15:40.007 --> 15:43.143
I'M NEVER GONNA
GET TO WEAR WHITE
AND WALK DOWN THE AISLE.

15:43.176 --> 15:46.413
AW. YOU WANTED TO WORK
AT THE MOVIE THEATER, TOO?

15:48.015 --> 15:50.450
YEAH. AND I GUESS
I'LL NEVER GET TO BE

15:50.483 --> 15:53.953
THE FIRST PRESIDENT
OF A SELF-SUFFICIENT
UNDERWATER COLONY.

15:53.987 --> 15:55.955
SO LONG, CHASELANTIS.

15:55.989 --> 15:59.959
WE WERE A GOOD TEAM
WHILE IT LASTED, GUYS.

15:59.993 --> 16:03.030
YEAH. THANKS FOR
ALWAYS BEING THERE.

16:03.063 --> 16:05.165
OYOU TOO..

16:05.198 --> 16:09.136
HEY, CAN YOU HAND ME
THAT VOLTOMETER?

16:09.169 --> 16:11.371
IM BUS OVER HERE.ORK.

16:15.142 --> 16:17.944
I'M NOT LETTING YOU DO THIS.
I'LL BE FINE.EROUS.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.113
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT YOU,
I'M WORRIED ABOUT ME!

16:20.147 --> 16:23.083
BESIDES, YOU'RE GONNA MISS
YOUI'M OKAY WITH IT.LE.

16:23.116 --> 16:26.053
AGAIN,
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT YOU,
I'M WORRIED ABOUT ME!

16:26.086 --> 16:29.622
LOOK, I'M THE ONLY CHANCE
ADAM, BREE AND CHASE HAVE.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.392
THEY DON'T KNOW
THAT THE ROOM COLLAPSES.

16:32.425 --> 16:35.062
IF I CAN GET THERE QUICKLY,
THEY CAN SHUT DOWN THE COLLIDER

16:35.095 --> 16:36.629
AND I CAN STILL
GET THEM OUT IN TIME!

16:36.663 --> 16:38.998
NO. DAVENPORT'S ROVER
WILL FIX EVERYTHING.

16:39.032 --> 16:42.735
BESIDES, YOU'RE STILL IN
THAT CLUMSY PHASE WHERE
YOU GOOF STUFF UP.

16:42.769 --> 16:47.006
LOOK, I'M THE ONE
WHO MESSED UP BY TELLING
ADAM, BREE AND CHASE THEIR FATE.

16:47.040 --> 16:51.644
IF THEY DON'T COME BACK,
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF.

16:51.678 --> 16:55.182
FINE.
THEN I'M GOING WITH YOU.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.617
IT'S TIME TO SEND IN SOME...

16:57.650 --> 17:00.187
* BACKUP!

17:00.220 --> 17:02.589
WE'LL TAKE DAVENPORT'S
TURBO-SPEEDSTER.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.424
CAN'T REACH THE PEDALS.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.159
YOU'LL DRIVE.

17:10.063 --> 17:11.698
OHH! THIS ISN'T WORKING!

17:11.731 --> 17:14.367
NOTHING IS WORKING.
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

17:14.401 --> 17:15.568
WELL,
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

17:15.602 --> 17:19.506
( high-pitched electrical
whining accelerates )

17:19.539 --> 17:22.175
I'M GONNA HAVE TO FRY
THE CONTROL PANEL WITH
MY FORCE FIELD.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.511
IT'S OUR LAST CHANCE
OF SHUTTING THIS THING DOWN.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.079
ADAM, RIP OUT THOSE WIRES
AND GET OUT OF THE WAY.

17:27.114 --> 17:28.415
HURRY!

17:28.448 --> 17:30.383
I LOVE RIPPIN' STUFF OUT!

17:32.352 --> 17:33.553
HUHH!

17:35.788 --> 17:40.293
( collider powering down )

17:40.327 --> 17:43.196
YES! GUYS, WE DID IT!
WE SHUT DOWN THE COLLIDER!

17:43.230 --> 17:45.165
(WHOO-HOO! )

17:47.134 --> 17:49.602
Donald:
 ADAM? BREE? CHASE?

17:49.636 --> 17:53.606
DUDE, MR. DAVENPORT
 TURNED INTO A WHEELIE ROBOT!

17:53.640 --> 17:56.443
I'M MONITORING YOU REMOTELY
VIA THE ROVER, ADAM.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.111
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING THERE?!

17:58.145 --> 18:00.046
LEO TOLD US WHAT HAPPENS,

18:00.079 --> 18:03.116
BUT YOU DESIGNED US
 TO SAVE THE WORLD,
 SO WE HAD TO COME.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.217
GUYS!

18:04.251 --> 18:06.186
WHAT'S LEO DOING THERE?!

18:06.219 --> 18:08.288
DID YOU SHUT DOWN
THE COLLIDER?

18:08.321 --> 18:09.389
YEAH,
WE JUST FINISHED.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.391
THEN GET OUT OF THERE, FAST.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.193
THE ROOM IS ABOUT
TO COLLAPSE.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.128
WHAT?

18:15.162 --> 18:17.530
( loud rumbling )

18:17.564 --> 18:19.199
AAHH!

18:22.569 --> 18:24.504
NO! NO!!!

18:24.537 --> 18:26.706
( rumbling, crashing )

18:26.739 --> 18:28.741
LEO!

18:31.311 --> 18:34.080
LEO JUST SAVED OUR LIVES.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.250
THAT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE US.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.519
HE DIDN'T NEED BIONICS
TO BE A HERO.

18:39.552 --> 18:42.222
HE OWED ME FIVE BUCKS!

18:47.227 --> 18:48.428
WAI--WAIT A SECOND.

18:48.461 --> 18:52.232
IF LEO'S GONE, THEN
SHOULDN'T YOU BE GONE TOO?

18:52.265 --> 18:54.701
I DON'T KNOW.
THIS IS ALL NEW TO ME.

18:56.236 --> 18:59.306
LEO'S STILL IN THERE!
ADAM, DIG HIM OUT!

19:07.146 --> 19:09.316
LEO!

19:09.349 --> 19:12.151
NEXT TIME
WHEN I SAY "GET OUT,"
GET OUT!!!

19:13.786 --> 19:15.788
HE'S OKAY.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.290
OH!

19:17.324 --> 19:20.827
I AM SO HAPPY
YOU ARE ALIVE!

19:23.663 --> 19:26.666
YOU OWE ME FIVE BUCKS.

19:26.699 --> 19:29.302
OH, NO! THE BLAST DOOR
( rumbling,IS SEALING!

19:29.336 --> 19:31.804
AAAAHHHH!!!

19:31.838 --> 19:34.140
EVERYONE OUT, NOW!

19:34.173 --> 19:36.276
( alarm wailing )

19:41.414 --> 19:43.650
THANK GOODNESS
YOU GUYS ARE ALL RIGHT.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.818
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!

19:45.852 --> 19:48.221
UHH! UHH! UHH!

19:48.255 --> 19:51.458
AND Y ARE GROUNDED
UNTIL...

19:51.491 --> 19:53.793
YOU BECOME YOU.

19:53.826 --> 19:58.398
LOOK, BIG D,
I KNOW YOU WERE WORRIED,
BUT IT ALL WORKED OUT.

19:58.431 --> 20:02.835
I-- I MEAN WE--
CHANGED THE COURSE
OF THE MISSION

20:02.869 --> 20:05.405
AND SAVED ADAM, BREE AND CHASE.

20:05.438 --> 20:07.340
I THINK WHAT
HE'S TRYING TO SAY IS,

20:07.374 --> 20:10.410
IF THEY SAVED THE WORLD
AND I SAVED THEM,

20:10.443 --> 20:12.545
THEN I SAVED THE WORLD!

20:15.648 --> 20:17.384
STILL GROUNDED.

20:17.417 --> 20:20.219
BY THE WAY,
JANELLE DROPPED BY.

20:20.253 --> 20:22.389
SHE SEEMED
A LITTLE UPSET.

20:22.422 --> 20:23.790
UH-OH.

20:26.459 --> 20:29.729
I END UP ALONE
WITH A DOG?!

20:29.762 --> 20:31.698
YOU BETTER FIX THIS!

20:31.731 --> 20:34.667
I'M NOT WALKING
DOWN THE AISLE WITH THAT.

20:34.701 --> 20:37.737
DON'T BE SILLY.
YOU CAN'T BRING A DOG
TO THE MOVIES.

20:41.274 --> 20:43.310
WELL, NOW THAT
YOU GUYS ARE SAFE,

20:43.343 --> 20:45.545
I GUESS I SHOULD
GET BACK TO THE FUTURE.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.380
COURTESY OF ME.
I DID THAT.

20:47.414 --> 20:49.816
I JUST LIKE TO REMIND EVERYBODY
THAT I CRACKED TIME TRAVEL.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.384
THAT WAS ME.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.653
THANKS FOR
COMING BACK FOR US.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.355
AND FOR HELPING
SAVE OUR LIVES.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.690
YEAH, AND FOR SHOWING US
THAT OUR TIME IS PRECIOUS,

20:57.724 --> 21:00.327
SO IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE FUN OF
LEO'S HEIGHT, GOTTA DO IT NOW.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.465
UNHH!

21:06.966 --> 21:08.768
STAY SMOOTH.

21:08.801 --> 21:10.002
ONLY IF YOU DO.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.340
ENJOY THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS,
MAN.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.808
THEY GO BY IN
THE BLINK OF AN EYE.

21:16.843 --> 21:17.977
( powering up )

21:21.581 --> 21:25.318
WOW. (choking up)
I MISS ME ALREADY.

21:30.990 --> 21:33.893
THEN A PARTICLE COLLIDER
WENT BERSERK

21:33.926 --> 21:36.529
AND COULD HAVE CREATED
A BLACK HOLE THAT WOULD
HAVE COLLAPSED THE PLANET,

21:36.563 --> 21:38.498
BUT ADAM, BREE AND CHASE
WENT TO TRY AND FIX IT,

21:38.531 --> 21:40.533
UNTIL A VERSION OF ME
FROM SEVEN YEARS IN THE FUTURE--

21:40.567 --> 21:42.402
(deep breath)--
CAME BACK IN TIME

21:42.435 --> 21:44.404
TO WARN US NOT TO, LIKE, GO.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.672
BUT THEY WENT ANYWAY,

21:45.705 --> 21:48.375
SO I HAD TO SAVE THEM INSTEAD OF
GOING TO THE MOVIES WITH YOU.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.610
OH, OKAY.
THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.512
WE'RE REALLY? COOL.

21:52.545 --> 21:53.546
NO.

22:00.387 --> 22:03.723
**
