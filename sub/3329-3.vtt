00:01.260 --> 00:03.319
Previously on Elementary...

00:03.370 --> 00:05.292
If you're looking for Sherlock,
he's downstairs.
Okay.

00:05.330 --> 00:07.036
SHERLOCK:
His name is Harlan Emple.

00:07.070 --> 00:08.332
He is the Rachel P. Hanson
Professor

00:08.370 --> 00:10.361
for Applied Mathematics
at Columbia University.

00:10.410 --> 00:13.334
What I don't get is
why he isn't wearing a shirt.

00:13.380 --> 00:16.304
He doesn't like anything to come
between him and the numbers.

00:16.350 --> 00:20.047
What is it? _
The answers to your questions
about Kitty.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.287
The truth is she was a
victim of a horrific crime.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.140
WATSON:
After you left last night,

00:24.190 --> 00:26.351
Sherlock gave me an envelope.

00:26.390 --> 00:27.812
Sherlock keeps saying

00:27.860 --> 00:29.748
that I need to get
a better sense of you,

00:29.790 --> 00:32.350
and maybe that will give you
a better sense of me.

00:34.860 --> 00:37.124
(thumping)

00:37.170 --> 00:39.832
(Sherlock and man arguing)

00:39.870 --> 00:41.565
(doorbell rings)

00:41.600 --> 00:42.567
It's open.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.601
(arguing continues)

00:47.180 --> 00:48.579
It's nothing.

00:48.610 --> 00:50.373
It's Sherlock and
one of his experts.

00:50.410 --> 00:51.502
Which one?

00:51.550 --> 00:52.744
Phillip something.

00:52.780 --> 00:54.077
Must be new.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.782
He's a knife-thrower.

00:56.820 --> 00:58.412
Why does Sherlock have
a knife-thrower?

00:58.450 --> 01:00.350
He got bored the other day,

01:00.390 --> 01:03.757
started looking into this, uh,
circus accident from the '305.

01:03.790 --> 01:07.556
The Great Galardo perforated one
of his assistants during an act,

01:07.600 --> 01:09.568
except Sherlock thinks
the blade was thrown

01:09.600 --> 01:10.862
by somebody in the stands,
not Galardo.

01:10.900 --> 01:14.495
Phillip, as far as I
can tell, disagrees.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.501
It can't be done, okay?

01:18.540 --> 01:19.507
(sighs)
It was done.

01:19.540 --> 01:21.132
You're wrong.

01:21.180 --> 01:22.875
Nobody can chuck
a knife that far.

01:22.910 --> 01:24.798
What's this?

01:24.850 --> 01:25.771
You're...

01:25.810 --> 01:26.777
Not here.

01:26.820 --> 01:27.878
I'm not here.

01:27.920 --> 01:29.342
Remember that, okay?

01:29.390 --> 01:31.119
Oh, yes. Heaven
forfend your work

01:31.150 --> 01:32.788
with me should endanger
your precious day job.

01:32.820 --> 01:34.685
You throw knives?

01:34.720 --> 01:37.848
You know, it was supposed
to be just you here.

01:41.160 --> 01:42.320
Has been for decades.

01:42.370 --> 01:43.496
Only, there's little money

01:43.530 --> 01:44.758
_ to be made
In the Impalement arts.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.165
So, as a youth, he turned

01:46.200 --> 01:47.895
to what you Americans
term "football."

01:47.940 --> 01:49.532
Is this a joke?

01:53.510 --> 01:54.602
Phillip, head
and heart.

01:54.640 --> 01:56.301
Come on.
Head and heart.

02:04.950 --> 02:06.451
Can I go?

02:06.490 --> 02:09.152
Yeah.

02:10.760 --> 02:13.923
15 years he spent throwing
that misshapen ball around.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.757
15 years.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.893
When I think of the acclaim
he could have brought

02:17.930 --> 02:20.296
to competitive blade slinging.

02:26.910 --> 02:28.639
You're following me,
Watson.

02:28.680 --> 02:30.238
I don't like it.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.373
I want you to help
me with something.

02:32.420 --> 02:33.614
This is Chad Keswick.

02:33.650 --> 02:34.617
He buys distressed
buildings,

02:34.650 --> 02:35.878
paints, spackles,

02:35.920 --> 02:37.319
and then flips them
for quick money.

02:37.350 --> 02:38.886
Who'd he kill?
No one.

02:38.920 --> 02:41.184
I was hired by one of
his rivals to find out

02:41.220 --> 02:42.653
why he's been circling
this old office building

02:42.690 --> 02:43.918
in Jamaica, Queens.

02:43.960 --> 02:45.279
She wants to know
why he thinks

02:45.330 --> 02:47.252
the building is
a good investment.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.291
Is there a crime in there,
something worth investigating?

02:49.330 --> 02:50.627
Well, I've been
shadowing Keswick,

02:50.670 --> 02:52.228
but yesterday I think
he noticed me.

02:52.270 --> 02:54.238
I want to switch
up the tall.

02:54.270 --> 02:56.932
You followed me for over
a week before I noticed you.

02:56.970 --> 02:58.733
Help me out, and I'll
cut you in on my fee.

02:58.770 --> 03:01.705
I don't work for you,
I work for Sherlock.

03:01.740 --> 03:02.968
I worked for him, too.

03:03.010 --> 03:05.501
And, in my experience,
he was always supportive

03:05.550 --> 03:07.643
of taking on work
outside the partnership.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.444
Sorry, it's not my cup of tea.

03:13.920 --> 03:15.911
*

03:29.740 --> 03:32.573
Hello, Portal Ten.

03:43.720 --> 03:45.938
I'm here, Belphegor.

03:45.990 --> 03:49.323
So where is the next clue?

04:01.870 --> 04:04.304
(panﬁng)

04:39.740 --> 04:42.379
Look, for the last time,
I was playing a game!

04:42.410 --> 04:44.970
Yeah, you called it
a puzzle hunt.

04:45.010 --> 04:46.841
Belphegor's Prime.

04:48.350 --> 04:50.614
Think Cicada 3301
or Octorine's Challenge.

04:51.920 --> 04:52.909
They're math games.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.382
Math-- maybe you've heard of it.

04:54.420 --> 04:55.887
GREGSON:
I've got some math for you.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.922
One dead guy
plus one live guy

04:57.960 --> 05:00.724
found in the same
deserted factory.

05:00.760 --> 05:04.719
I was not "found" there;
I am the one who called 911.

05:04.770 --> 05:06.897
I was waiting there
for the police.

05:08.370 --> 05:10.008
we're just trying
to do our jobs, all right?

05:10.040 --> 05:11.667
First officers
on the scene described you

05:11.710 --> 05:12.972
as "extremely agitated."

05:13.010 --> 05:14.568
Well, of course
I was agitated.

05:14.610 --> 05:17.408
I had just found
a dead guy in mothballs!

05:17.450 --> 05:20.374
And did I mention that I have
not slept in almost two days?

05:20.420 --> 05:21.910
Because of the math game.

05:21.950 --> 05:23.349
(sighs)

05:23.390 --> 05:24.618
Can I borrow those?

05:27.090 --> 05:29.684
This...

05:29.730 --> 05:31.880
is Belphegor's Prime, okay?

05:31.930 --> 05:33.158
It's a numeric palindrome.

05:33.200 --> 05:38.797
It's 666 bookended by 13 zeroes
and then bracketed with ones.

05:38.830 --> 05:41.867
Named for the demon Belphegor
who was a prince of hell.

05:41.900 --> 05:44.607
The first clue for the hunt
started making the rounds

05:44.640 --> 05:45.902
a few months ago.

05:45.940 --> 05:47.635
It was a JPEG with two numbers
hidden in it.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.602
You divide those numbers
by Belphegor's Prime,

05:49.650 --> 05:52.869
and you get the GPS coordinates
for a restroom at the Bronx Zoo.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.979
You go to the restroom,
you find a phone number.

05:55.020 --> 05:56.885
You send a text to the number,
you get the next clue.

05:56.920 --> 05:57.887
Which is another math problem.

05:57.920 --> 05:58.887
Exactly.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.512
Only, this one is harder.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.084
And that's how it works.

06:02.120 --> 06:04.020
You know, but for
each one that you solve,

06:04.060 --> 06:06.153
you get a new set
of GPS coordinates.

06:06.190 --> 06:09.728
And that means that you've
completed a stage, or a portal.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.726
And last night,
I was on Portal Ten.

06:11.770 --> 06:13.761
And...

06:15.070 --> 06:16.606
You know what?

06:16.640 --> 06:18.062
I want to talk
to Sherlock and Joan.

06:18.110 --> 06:19.975
Look, Mr. Emple...
No, I'm sorry.

06:20.010 --> 06:22.035
I told the police down
at the factory that I know them.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.547
Isn't that the whole reason

06:23.580 --> 06:25.002
that I was brought here
to this squad?

06:25.050 --> 06:28.440
1-1 am not saying another word
until they are here.

06:30.620 --> 06:33.555
SHERLOCK: Harlan Emple is
indeed an acquaintance.

06:33.590 --> 06:35.751
He is, in point of fact,
one of my "irregulars."

06:35.790 --> 06:36.825
One of your what?

06:36.860 --> 06:38.589
Irregulars.

06:38.630 --> 06:39.858
I'm your consultant, Captain;
they are mine.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.595
They're a handful
of experts I turn to

06:41.630 --> 06:44.190
when I encounter problems which
are beyond my pool of knowledge.

06:44.230 --> 06:45.891
Harlan is
a brilliant mathematician.

06:45.930 --> 06:47.830
And on the handful of occasions
I have tackled a case

06:47.870 --> 06:49.098
which pertained
to mathematics...

06:49.140 --> 06:51.461
He helped you out.
Well, the good news

06:51.510 --> 06:54.001
for him is the preliminary
autopsy report just came in

06:54.040 --> 06:55.530
before you got here.

06:55.580 --> 06:57.070
And the ME. puts
the time of death

06:57.110 --> 06:58.998
between 4:00 and
6:00 pm. last night.

06:59.050 --> 07:00.119
Mr. Emple was teaching

07:00.150 --> 07:01.617
a class at Columbia.

07:01.650 --> 07:03.686
So the victim is
yet to be identified?

07:03.720 --> 07:05.779
No I.D., no phone.

07:05.820 --> 07:08.015
First detective on the scene
liked it for a mob hit,

07:08.060 --> 07:09.652
so_while we're
running the prints,

07:09.690 --> 07:11.681
he's showing the vic's
face around OCID.

07:11.730 --> 07:14.927
Marcus here was about to walk
the scene With Mr. Emple.

07:14.960 --> 07:16.928
You're here now;
you might as well tag along.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.165
Actually, Captain,
I'm quite busy today.

07:19.200 --> 07:21.088
This is a John Doe,
and we got nothing.

07:21.140 --> 07:23.506
And, like you just said,
you're my consultant.

07:23.540 --> 07:24.666
So, go consult.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.108
Watson.

07:29.140 --> 07:30.676
Um, he's your friend.

07:30.710 --> 07:32.678
Actually, Kitty is
otherwise engaged,

07:32.720 --> 07:35.712
and he did actually help both
of us with a case last year.

07:35.750 --> 07:36.739
Did he not?

07:36.790 --> 07:38.985
(sighs)

07:39.020 --> 07:42.217
HARLAN: Have I told you
how good it is to see you?

07:42.260 --> 07:43.659
Yes, you have.
Three times.

07:43.690 --> 07:44.759
Well, it is.

07:44.790 --> 07:45.688
Hey, lousy circumstances.

07:45.730 --> 07:47.652
But, uh, hey...

07:47.700 --> 07:49.827
I heard from your boss that you
just, uh, got back from London.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.599
Were you working
a case or...?

07:51.630 --> 07:52.699
No, I moved back there.

07:52.740 --> 07:53.798
You mean moved, moved?

07:53.840 --> 07:54.989
Is there another
definition?

07:55.040 --> 07:56.667
I was there for
eight months,

07:56.710 --> 07:58.962
and had a change of heart
and returned to New York.

07:59.010 --> 08:00.671
So, you moved to London,
and you didn't, uh...

08:00.710 --> 08:02.177
You know what?
Doesn't even matter.

08:02.210 --> 08:03.746
The point is you're back!

08:03.780 --> 08:05.748
Mr. Emple.
Uh, duty calls.

08:05.780 --> 08:07.008
Yeah.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.785
It's interesting.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.229
Mothballs are interesting?

08:18.260 --> 08:20.228
They were taken from
that cabinet over there.

08:20.260 --> 08:24.162
Obviously, to cover the smell
of John Doe's decay.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.259
The killer didn't
bring them with him.

08:26.300 --> 08:29.167
Perhaps leaving the body here
was not part of his plan, hmm?

08:31.170 --> 08:34.230
Doe was shot in the foot
first and then the knee.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.771
Either those were
two really bad misses or...

08:36.810 --> 08:39.677
Or the killer was torturing him.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.109
This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.

08:42.150 --> 08:44.243
So you want to tell me why you
really asked me to come here?

08:44.290 --> 08:46.713
"This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own."

08:46.760 --> 08:47.988
That's funny.

08:48.020 --> 08:49.783
That's exactly what
I would have said

08:49.830 --> 08:51.752
had I been present when you
asked Kitty for her assistance

08:51.790 --> 08:53.189
with your tawdry side job.

08:53.230 --> 08:55.698
"Tawdry"?
I wanted you to know I approve.

08:55.730 --> 08:57.163
Of what?

08:57.200 --> 08:59.794
Youragenda
with regards to Kitty.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.262
Several days ago,
I gave you her file.

09:01.300 --> 09:03.200
And then you show up at
the brownstone yesterday,

09:03.240 --> 09:04.730
and you invite her
into an investigation.

09:04.770 --> 09:06.601
Coincidence? No, I think not.

09:06.640 --> 09:09.803
You feel for her.
And now you wish to engage.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.239
It's not an outcome
I would have predicted, no.

09:14.950 --> 09:16.645
She could learn
a great deal from you,

09:16.690 --> 09:18.646
especially with regards
to how to get the most

09:18.690 --> 09:21.079
from my tutelage.

09:21.120 --> 09:24.021
So, I've already dispatched her
to, uh, follow your Mr. Keswick.

09:24.060 --> 09:26.028
But that's not
what I actually...

09:26.060 --> 09:27.652
Hanan!

09:29.000 --> 09:31.298
You came here to retrieve
a phone number, dId you not?

09:31.330 --> 09:32.888
You would send a text,
and then receive

09:32.940 --> 09:35.067
the next clue in the game
that you were playing.

09:35.100 --> 09:36.931
Yeah, but I didn't find it.

09:36.970 --> 09:38.301
Not that I kept looking

09:38.340 --> 09:40.672
after the dead guy
fell out of the locker.

09:40.710 --> 09:42.302
Yeah, CSU didn't find
any number either.

09:42.340 --> 09:44.376
Probably because
it's under that paint.

09:44.410 --> 09:46.617
It's fresh.

09:46.650 --> 09:48.072
Applied in the last

09:48.120 --> 09:50.987
24 hours.

09:51.020 --> 09:52.988
Right after John Doe's murder,
I'd wager.

09:53.020 --> 09:55.386
You don't think
this was a mob hit?

09:55.420 --> 09:57.388
Doe and the killer were
playing the game, too.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.625
The killer shot Doe and
then covered up the number

09:59.660 --> 10:00.991
so no one else could use it.

10:01.030 --> 10:03.066
What's the prize
in your little contest?

10:03.100 --> 10:05.967
Well, I'm doing it
mostly for the math.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.936
But, uh, $1,707,071.

10:09.970 --> 10:12.165
_It's another
palindromic prime.

10:12.210 --> 10:15.634
Did I not mention_the
money at the station?

10:15.680 --> 10:16.806
BELL:
Who the hell can afford

10:16.850 --> 10:18.909
that kind of payout
for a puzzle hunt?

10:18.950 --> 10:20.417
Well, most people
think it's CAML.

10:20.450 --> 10:22.816
The Center for Applied
Mathematics and Logic.

10:24.450 --> 10:25.940
Wait, most people
"think" it's them?

10:25.990 --> 10:27.787
Well, hunts like these,

10:27.820 --> 10:29.685
the organizers are
almost always anonymous.

10:29.730 --> 10:30.856
It's S.O.P.

10:30.890 --> 10:32.721
What about the
contestants?

10:32.760 --> 10:35.194
Is anonymity
also S.O.P.?

10:35.230 --> 10:37.698
For the most part, yeah.

10:37.730 --> 10:41.359
But, guys, math peeps
are my peeps, okay?

10:41.400 --> 10:44.801
It's, uh, like
a community, sort of.

10:44.840 --> 10:47.206
I can think of ten
or 12 other people

10:47.240 --> 10:48.207
who were probably competing.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.229
Would that help?

10:51.480 --> 10:53.448
(small dog barking)
WOMAN: No.

10:53.480 --> 10:56.313
I'm sorry, I don't know him.

10:56.350 --> 10:59.046
But you admit you were
competing in Belphegor's Prime.

10:59.090 --> 11:00.250
I do.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.229
Pepe!

11:04.260 --> 11:06.455
(barking continues)

11:06.490 --> 11:08.754
Sorry. He doesn't
like strangers.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.891
Give him one of these.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.396
Get on his good side.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.704
(barking continues)

11:22.780 --> 11:24.668
What are you doing?

11:26.780 --> 11:29.044
I'm just verifying that
you've been lying to us.

11:29.080 --> 11:32.243
You did know the
dead man, did you not?

11:32.290 --> 11:35.316
I reviewed his personal
effects at the morgue earlier.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.328
The coroner reported finding
crumbs in one of his pockets.

11:37.360 --> 11:38.327
I tasted one.

11:38.360 --> 11:39.827
Why would you...?

11:39.860 --> 11:41.088
At first, I thought
they were from

11:41.130 --> 11:42.995
a particularly rancid
brand of cheese,

11:43.030 --> 11:45.897
but, no... they're from
one of Pepe's treats.

11:45.930 --> 11:47.830
Homemade?

11:47.870 --> 11:51.033
Harlan was able to give us
the names of nine other people

11:51.070 --> 11:52.503
he believed to be
other competitors.

11:52.540 --> 11:54.337
Our colleagues are
investigating them as we speak,

11:54.380 --> 11:56.234
but I'll quite happily
recommend that the NYPD

11:56.280 --> 11:58.339
focus its attention
entirely on you.

12:02.450 --> 12:05.044
His name was Ike Walaczek.

12:05.090 --> 12:07.854
In another lifetime,
he was my boyfriend.

12:07.890 --> 12:09.209
And what of
this lifetime?

12:09.260 --> 12:11.080
We were working together.

12:11.130 --> 12:13.155
On Belphegor's.
What?!

12:13.200 --> 12:15.020
He was a numerical analyst
at the Tory Foundation.

12:15.060 --> 12:16.254
I work mostly in combinatorics.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.892
I thought we would make
a good team.

12:17.930 --> 12:19.158
But there aren't
supposed to be teams.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.065
Not in a puzzle hunt.
It's bad form.

12:21.100 --> 12:22.067
Hanan”.

12:22.100 --> 12:24.068
I'm just saying...

12:24.110 --> 12:25.862
My husband
wouldn't understand,

12:25.910 --> 12:28.970
so I decided I wouldn't tell him
until after we won the money.

12:29.010 --> 12:31.444
A team-- so that's how
you got there before me.

12:31.480 --> 12:33.038
I wasn't there.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.877
Tom and I were out_ of town
until this morning.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.547
_ His cou_sin_ __
was getting married In Hawaii.

12:36.580 --> 12:39.014
That's why Ike went
to the coordinates by himself.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.278
Because I couldn't.

12:42.830 --> 12:45.128
These are pictures I took.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.890
Check the dates.

12:47.930 --> 12:50.069
You gave the police
nine other names?

12:50.100 --> 12:51.965
People you thought
were competing?

12:52.000 --> 12:53.092
I've got 16.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.493
And I know they were competing.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.804
KITTY: He talked to her
outside the Jamaica property

12:59.840 --> 13:04.209
for about 20 minutes,
and then this truck rolled up.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.206
Any idea what's
inside the crate?

13:06.250 --> 13:07.444
Nope.

13:07.480 --> 13:09.016
I can't identify
the woman either.

13:09.050 --> 13:10.881
Everything about her
said money though.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.980
She, Keswick
and the mystery box

13:14.020 --> 13:16.113
stayed inside the building
for about three hours,

13:16.160 --> 13:18.253
and then off they went.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.295
Okay.

13:22.330 --> 13:24.560
You know where
to send the check.

13:24.600 --> 13:28.536
You haven't asked me about
the file Sherlock gave me.

13:28.570 --> 13:30.561
Why would I?

13:30.610 --> 13:34.432
You said it would give me
a better sense of you-- it did.

13:36.110 --> 13:38.578
That's why you asked
for my help.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.419
Because you felt sorry for me.

13:40.450 --> 13:42.918
No.

13:42.950 --> 13:44.884
You just don't seem interested
in anything

13:44.920 --> 13:46.478
outside of becoming
a detective.

13:46.520 --> 13:49.409
There she is.

13:49.460 --> 13:51.928
The old counselor.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.099
Who used to hold
Sherlock's hand.

13:56.060 --> 13:58.199
Everything that you read,

13:58.230 --> 14:01.199
everything that happened to me,
that's all it is.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.128
It's just something
that happened.

14:03.170 --> 14:06.879
And it's all
in the past now.

14:06.910 --> 14:09.208
So let's just
leave it there, shall we?

14:14.980 --> 14:17.380
(phone vibrating)

14:20.290 --> 14:22.155
(groans quietly)

14:22.190 --> 14:22.929
Hello.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.257
You've had sex.

14:24.290 --> 14:25.518
Excuse me?

14:25.560 --> 14:26.959
_I can hear it
In your v0Ice.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.024
You've joined paunches.

14:28.060 --> 14:29.254
Good for you, Watson.

14:29.300 --> 14:31.120
As you know, I think
the act of love

14:31.170 --> 14:32.967
can be quite conducive to...
What do you want?

14:33.000 --> 14:35.195
Merely to apprise you
of a new development

14:35.240 --> 14:36.593
in the murder of
Ike Walaczek.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.437
As I informed
you yesterday,

14:38.470 --> 14:40.574
Harlan and I were given
a new list of competitors.

14:40.610 --> 14:43.647
One name leapt out:
Byron Lowenthal.

14:43.680 --> 14:46.478
He's a statistician at the
Public Utilities Commission

14:46.510 --> 14:48.944
and a diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic.

14:48.980 --> 14:50.481
He's been hospitalized
for becoming violent

14:50.520 --> 14:52.044
on no fewer_
than three occaSIons.

14:52.090 --> 14:54.217
Certainly sounds like
it could be our guy.

14:54.260 --> 14:57.627
Unfortunately, Mr. Lowenthal had
another break earlier this year.

14:57.660 --> 15:00.390
He's been staying in
a transient hotel ever since.

15:00.430 --> 15:02.455
De_tective Bell and I _
are g0Ing to speak WIth hIm.

15:02.500 --> 15:03.626
You want me to meet you?

15:03.670 --> 15:05.194
Oh, no, we're already here.

15:05.230 --> 15:06.936
Aanay, now that I know
that you've enjoyed coitus

15:06.970 --> 15:08.130
and could enjoy more
in the near future...

15:08.170 --> 15:10.161
When you're done,
we need to talk.

15:10.210 --> 15:11.336
(phone beeps off)

15:13.110 --> 15:15.203
Byron Lowenthal,
you in there?

15:15.240 --> 15:16.377
LOWENTHAL:
Who is it?

15:16.410 --> 15:18.139
It's Detective Bell, NYPD.

15:18.180 --> 15:20.648
My colleague and I would like
to ask you some questions.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.944
LOWENTHAL: Let me
get some pants on.

15:25.050 --> 15:26.517
(quiet thump)

15:26.550 --> 15:28.415
(unzipping)

15:35.700 --> 15:38.396
S-Sorry, Ijust... I, um...

15:38.430 --> 15:40.466
I-I thought I heard
Mr. Lowenthal retr...

15:42.740 --> 15:44.935
(car alarms blaring)

16:14.040 --> 16:16.258
You guys got luclq.

16:16.300 --> 16:18.029
Well, luck had little
to do with it, actually.

16:18.070 --> 16:19.537
I... I heard Mr. Lowenthal

16:19.570 --> 16:22.038
pulling a heaw object off
a shelf, placing it on his bed,

16:22.080 --> 16:24.105
and the sound of
the zipper indicated

16:24.150 --> 16:26.038
that it was
a large gun case.

16:26.080 --> 16:28.071
Looks like he was sane enough
to do math, but not much else.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.269
Plus, he was
pretty hopped up.

16:29.320 --> 16:30.787
Caffeine pills,
energy drinks,

16:30.820 --> 16:33.482
pretty much every legal
stimulant you can buy.

16:33.520 --> 16:35.317
Plus a few illegal ones.

16:35.360 --> 16:37.282
Hmm. Obviously, he was
keeping himself awake

16:37.330 --> 16:38.752
so he could work on
Belphegor's.

16:38.790 --> 16:41.725
This... is obvious to you?

16:41.760 --> 16:43.261
I confess the maths
are beyond me,

16:43.300 --> 16:45.461
but I took the liberty of
sending pictures of what

16:45.500 --> 16:47.365
appear to be Mr. Lowenthal's
most recent scribbles

16:47.400 --> 16:48.435
to Harlan Emple,
and he's confirmed

16:48.470 --> 16:50.165
they are part of the contest.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.234
With your permission,
I'd like copies of these

16:51.270 --> 16:53.306
sent to my home
so he can review them.

16:53.340 --> 16:54.238
What for?

16:54.280 --> 16:55.338
If Byron Lowenthal

16:55.380 --> 16:56.779
did kill Ike Walaczek,

16:58.450 --> 17:00.338
which would have yielded
the next problem.

17:00.380 --> 17:01.642
That problem's solution

17:01.680 --> 17:03.284
would be GPS coordinates.

17:03.320 --> 17:04.742
If he's recorded them
in his books...

17:04.790 --> 17:07.088
Your pal will be able to tell us
where he's headed next.

17:07.120 --> 17:09.350
I'll get our guys to give you

17:09.390 --> 17:10.550
whatever you need.

17:11.630 --> 17:13.393
Scans are still coming through,

17:13.430 --> 17:15.591
but I've put what we've got
so far up on the wall.

17:15.630 --> 17:17.666
Sherlock said that
you prefer it that way.

17:17.700 --> 17:19.429
Picked it up from him,
actually.

17:19.470 --> 17:22.769
Makes me feel like I'm really
inside of the problem.

17:25.340 --> 17:27.535
I'll, uh, let you know
ifI need anything.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.346
Oh, I work without a shirt.

17:30.380 --> 17:33.440
Sometimes makes me feel
closer to the numbers.

17:33.480 --> 17:36.449
You'll need to, uh,
check the printer in the study

17:36.480 --> 17:38.141
for more pages.

17:38.190 --> 17:39.748
Uh, this is nice,
you know?

17:39.790 --> 17:41.758
Meeting another member
of the team.

17:41.790 --> 17:43.155
You know, Team Sherlock.

17:43.190 --> 17:44.828
You help him, I help him...

17:46.490 --> 17:48.094
Obviously, you haven't
tackled a case

17:48.130 --> 17:49.392
with high-order math since
you started working with him,

17:49.430 --> 17:52.263
or we would've...

17:52.300 --> 17:53.369
What?

17:53.400 --> 17:54.537
What?

17:54.570 --> 17:56.435
Wait...

17:56.470 --> 17:58.358
have you worked a case
with high-order math?

17:59.370 --> 18:00.530
You have, haven't you?

18:00.580 --> 18:02.332
Does it matter?

18:02.380 --> 18:04.405
Of course it...

18:04.450 --> 18:05.803
Oh, my God.

18:05.850 --> 18:07.715
Did he fire me?

18:07.750 --> 18:09.445
All I know
is that back in London,

18:09.480 --> 18:11.345
we worked a case that involved
FibonaCCI spIrals...

18:11.390 --> 18:13.153
He fired me.

18:13.190 --> 18:15.784
...and he called _some woman
named IndIra Patel.

18:15.820 --> 18:17.151
(scoffs)

18:17.190 --> 18:18.418
She's at Berkeley.

18:18.460 --> 18:20.189
I'm three time zones closer!

18:20.230 --> 18:21.527
You're here now.

18:21.560 --> 18:23.892
Sure, because I found
a dead body.

18:23.930 --> 18:26.763
I have to go; I have to run
some errands for Sherlock.

18:30.370 --> 18:32.361
I-I don't know
what was in the crate,

18:32.410 --> 18:33.729
but the stenciling on
the side indicates

18:33.780 --> 18:35.407
it came from one of
the SUNY schools.

18:35.440 --> 18:37.340
I put another detective
on Keswick...

18:37.380 --> 18:39.575
Don't kill me, I had to
use your razor to shave.

18:39.610 --> 18:41.578
I...

18:41.620 --> 18:43.508
You must be Andrew.

18:43.550 --> 18:44.915
Sherlock Holmes.

18:44.950 --> 18:47.214
Sorry.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.911
Joan said you were coming;
I... I forgot.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.587
It's not how
I wanted to meet you.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.450
She said you can tell
a lot about people

18:53.500 --> 18:54.649
just by looking at them.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.656
I swear, I...
usually wear pants.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.395
Well, in my experience,
most people

18:58.430 --> 18:59.658
need only be concerned
I won't notice

18:59.700 --> 19:00.735
anything worth remarking upon.

19:02.440 --> 19:04.829
Watson seems adequately sexed.

19:06.440 --> 19:08.328
Hey.

19:08.380 --> 19:10.177
I was just introducing myself.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.846
I've got that thing.
I'll see you tonight.

19:14.880 --> 19:15.869
Okay.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.653
Your home, Watson...

19:24.690 --> 19:26.555
it's utterly pleasant.

19:26.590 --> 19:28.353
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.856
When you told me
you wanted a life of your own,

19:29.900 --> 19:31.219
I didn't realize
that you meant you wanted

19:31.270 --> 19:32.498
the same life everyone else has.

19:32.530 --> 19:34.191
But at any rate,
none of my business, is it?

19:34.240 --> 19:35.696
It's not.
And I didn't ask you here

19:35.740 --> 19:37.367
to talk about my apartment.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.435
No, you asked me here
to discuss Kitty.

19:39.470 --> 19:40.971
If she were not _
the topIc of conversatIon,

19:41.010 --> 19:43.444
then you wouldn't have
invited me to your home,

19:43.480 --> 19:45.277
where there's no chance
she'll be present.

19:46.910 --> 19:48.571
She disappointed you
in some way.

19:48.620 --> 19:49.712
Skills not up to snuff?

19:49.750 --> 19:51.786
Please remember
she Is a nOVICe.

19:51.820 --> 19:53.515
Actually, she did a great job.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.788
But I have some concerns.

19:54.820 --> 19:56.458
I thought we could
talk about them.

19:58.460 --> 19:59.586
You think that
Kitty needs help

19:59.630 --> 20:00.619
above and beyond
my mentorship.

20:00.660 --> 20:01.854
You read the same
file I did.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.561
She's a rape victim.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.591
She was kept and tortured.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.389
Mm.

20:10.610 --> 20:13.670
You know me, so surely you know

20:13.710 --> 20:17.601
I've broached the subject of
a support group meeting before.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.470
Even offered
to pay for therapy.

20:19.510 --> 20:21.444
She's not interested, I know.

20:21.480 --> 20:22.970
Just as you also know

20:23.020 --> 20:25.409
someone with a problem
can't be forced to get help.

20:25.450 --> 20:27.259
They have to want it.

20:27.290 --> 20:29.281
What Kitty wants
is to be a detective.

20:31.290 --> 20:33.019
I am taking pains
to try and channel

20:33.060 --> 20:34.891
her residual feelings
into her work.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.765
Well, that works out
great for you.

20:40.670 --> 20:42.888
You told me that
you took on a partner

20:42.940 --> 20:45.363
because you wanted to replicate
what you and I had.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.378
That you thought it helped
with your recovery.

20:47.410 --> 20:49.002
You think I would
try and take advantage

20:49.040 --> 20:50.746
of the victim of a trauma?

20:50.780 --> 20:53.613
Of course not, but there is
a conflict of interest here.

20:53.650 --> 20:56.744
She needs what she needs,
but you need what you need, too.

20:58.650 --> 21:00.550
(sighs)

21:00.590 --> 21:04.583
It's-it's good that you're
in her life now, Watson.

21:04.630 --> 21:07.326
I mean,
it's commonly believed that, um,

21:07.360 --> 21:10.761
a child benefits mostly from
the presence of two parents.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.689
He-- or she, in this case--
can absorb certain qualities

21:13.740 --> 21:15.992
from the father--
clear-eyed view of the world,

21:16.040 --> 21:17.769
capacity of
rational thought, etcetera.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.698
They can also absorb certain
qualities from the mother.

21:19.740 --> 21:21.708
Excuse me, but I am not
Kitty's mother,

21:21.740 --> 21:23.571
and she sure as hell
Is not our chIId.

21:25.580 --> 21:27.673
She says that she doesn't
need help-- fine--

21:27.720 --> 21:29.347
but you know better.

21:29.380 --> 21:31.610
And you're gonna have to be
the one that tells her.

21:31.650 --> 21:33.686
(phone chimes)

21:34.560 --> 21:36.312
It's Harlan.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.885
Making progress with the maths.

21:41.430 --> 21:43.398
HARLAN: We thought
that Byron and Ike

21:43.430 --> 21:44.988
arrived at Portal Ten
SImultaneously.

21:45.030 --> 21:47.396
That would've meant that they
were doing all the same math

21:47.440 --> 21:48.566
at essentially
the same time.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.704
Only, the math
you found at Byron's place

21:50.740 --> 21:51.707
says that's wrong.

21:51.740 --> 21:53.037
He was one step behind Ike.

21:53.070 --> 21:55.436
Are you proposing he did
not kill Mr. Walaczek?

21:55.480 --> 21:57.675
I don't know, but that's
not the weirdest part.

21:57.710 --> 21:59.541
Byron was obsessive.

21:59.580 --> 22:00.740
He time-stamped
almost everything he did.

22:00.780 --> 22:03.647
He only solved
the Portal Nine problem,

22:03.690 --> 22:05.885
the same problem that sent me
to that old factory last night.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.683
But get this--

22:07.720 --> 22:09.517
he wasn't given
the same problem as me.

22:09.560 --> 22:11.482
And so it would've yielded
GPS coordinates

22:11.530 --> 22:12.986
for an entirely
different location.

22:13.030 --> 22:16.591
The person in charge of
the game changed the clue

22:16.630 --> 22:17.892
after the police
found Ike's body.

22:17.930 --> 22:20.569
Well, he had to, right?

22:20.600 --> 22:22.659
If he hadn't, he would be
sending other competitors

22:22.700 --> 22:23.667
to an active crime scene.

22:23.710 --> 22:24.961
The important thing is

22:25.010 --> 22:26.102
I figured out the coordinates

22:26.140 --> 22:27.539
to the second location.

22:27.580 --> 22:30.105
I know where Byron went.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.641
What are you doing?

22:31.680 --> 22:33.079
You're saying he
time-stamped everything.

22:33.110 --> 22:34.975
I'm looking at the time
he received his clues.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.511
It's all there, to the second,
but what does that have to do...

22:37.550 --> 22:38.812
What if you hadn't
found a body?

22:38.850 --> 22:40.750
If the game had
proceeded as planned,

22:40.790 --> 22:42.087
what were you meant
to do there?

22:42.120 --> 22:43.951
I would have sent a text
to the phone number,

22:43.990 --> 22:46.129
the one that the killer painted
over, and then I would have

22:46.160 --> 22:47.718
gotten a message back
with the next problem.

22:47.760 --> 22:49.398
There's an extra
step In there.

22:49.430 --> 22:51.091
Why all this rigmarole with
phone numbers and texts?

22:51.130 --> 22:53.667
Why not just post the problem
itself at the factory?

22:53.700 --> 22:56.692
I don't know, it's just the way
the game is played.

22:56.740 --> 22:58.708
They're for an old
industrial area in Queens.

22:58.740 --> 23:01.629
You're welcome
for fIndIng your suspect.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.944
If I'm right, Harlan,
what you've found...

23:03.980 --> 23:05.777
is the site of
another murder.

23:05.810 --> 23:07.744
Byron Lowenthal's.

23:10.750 --> 23:12.889
BELL: You were right,
Lowenthal's dead.

23:12.920 --> 23:15.616
He was shot in the foot,
then the knee.

23:15.660 --> 23:17.753
Just like
Ike Wallaczek.

23:17.790 --> 23:21.055
I'm, uh, gonna look
over here now.

23:21.100 --> 23:24.092
Well, we think the perp
was pulling the body

23:24.130 --> 23:26.098
to a car that was parked
over there.

23:26.130 --> 23:28.735
Then he just
left him here.

23:28.770 --> 23:30.761
Probably afraid
he'd been spotted.

23:30.810 --> 23:33.506
There's a lot
of homeless in the area.

23:36.110 --> 23:37.748
Question is:

23:37.780 --> 23:39.645
how'd you know
Lowenthal was the next victim

23:39.680 --> 23:41.011
and not the killer?

23:44.090 --> 23:46.684
Well, that's
quite simple, really.

23:46.720 --> 23:49.086
The game is directing
its players to remote locales,

23:49.120 --> 23:51.657
and then instructing them
to send a text message

23:51.690 --> 23:52.987
indicating their presence.

23:53.030 --> 23:54.895
I suspect the killer wanted
to remove the body

23:54.930 --> 23:57.819
so he could keep this new
location "in play," so to speak.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.792
Still missing the "simple" part.

23:59.830 --> 24:01.536
The late Mr. Lowenthal

24:01.570 --> 24:03.128
received his final clue

24:03.170 --> 24:05.035
after Harlan discovered
Ike Wallaczek's body,

24:05.070 --> 24:07.732
but before news of the killing
had reached the media.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.236
That means the
game's deSIgner

24:09.280 --> 24:11.168
knew the location
had been compromised.

24:11.210 --> 24:13.519
And the only way
that he could have known that,

24:13.550 --> 24:14.869
at the time that he knew it,

24:14.920 --> 24:16.649
was if he, himself,
was the killer.

24:18.120 --> 24:20.850
Belphegor's Prime is not
a treasure hunt.

24:20.890 --> 24:22.187
It's a trap.

24:27.730 --> 24:29.891
(toilet flushes)

24:33.130 --> 24:34.791
Better?

24:34.840 --> 24:37.092
False alarm.

24:37.140 --> 24:40.109
But I still feel
a |Ittle queasy.

24:40.140 --> 24:41.209
(exhales)

24:43.210 --> 24:44.768
This new dead guy--

24:44.810 --> 24:47.574
your friend said that he was
tortured, too, right?

24:47.620 --> 24:49.872
Right before the killer tried
to abscond with his corpse.

24:49.920 --> 24:51.888
I assume
he intended to take

24:51.920 --> 24:54.889
Ike Wallaczek away with him
as well, only Ike was too large.

24:54.920 --> 24:57.115
A speedy mothballing
was the best he could do.

24:57.160 --> 24:59.720
So, just to recap,

24:59.760 --> 25:02.126
I've spent the last
few months of my life

25:02.160 --> 25:05.926
playing a game that was
designed to kill me.

25:05.970 --> 25:08.188
Got to be a metaphor
in there somewhere, right?

25:08.240 --> 25:11.732
I think the word you're
looking for is "moral."

25:11.770 --> 25:14.238
There is a moral in_there:
games are for IdIots.

25:16.010 --> 25:17.204
(cell phone chimes)

25:17.240 --> 25:19.049
Breaking news from Ramapo.

25:19.080 --> 25:22.015
Kitty reports the Center for
Applied Mathematics and Logic

25:22.050 --> 25:24.644
is not the sponsor
of Belphegor's Prime.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.908
Then it's got to be
a serial killer, right?

25:26.950 --> 25:28.178
Someone who's obsessed
with mathematicians?

25:28.220 --> 25:29.858
Mm.

25:29.890 --> 25:32.688
Perhaps he was bullied
by mathematicians as a child.

25:32.730 --> 25:34.755
Or mathematicians
killed his parents.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.222
I'm being serious.

25:36.260 --> 25:38.228
Serial killers who devise
elaborate death traps

25:38.270 --> 25:39.965
are the stuff of pulp fiction.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.797
And besides, with respect
to these murders,

25:41.840 --> 25:43.831
there are none
of the elaborations

25:43.870 --> 25:46.338
which mark that sort of culprit.

25:46.370 --> 25:48.679
If anything, I would describe
the work as businesslike.

25:48.710 --> 25:50.905
Then it's the government.

25:50.950 --> 25:53.942
I mean, the-the game was some
sort of test to weed out people

25:53.980 --> 25:55.811
who could weaponize math.

25:55.850 --> 25:57.909
The American intelligence
apparatus may be clod-like,

25:57.950 --> 25:59.781
but I think they would
do a better job

25:59.820 --> 26:01.253
of disposing of two bodies,
don't you?

26:01.290 --> 26:02.780
(cell phone ringing)

26:02.820 --> 26:04.583
Watson?

26:04.630 --> 26:06.257
WATSON: I just heard
from one of the suspects

26:06.290 --> 26:07.689
Marcus and I talked to
yesterday,

26:07.730 --> 26:08.890
another puzzle-hunter.

26:08.930 --> 26:11.160
Tell me he confessed
to the murders.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.065
We ruled him out right away,
but he heard about

26:13.100 --> 26:14.965
Byron Lowenthal's murder on
the news and wanted me to know

26:15.000 --> 26:17.935
he's at a friend's place,
some guy named Paul.

26:17.970 --> 26:19.699
That is fascinating.

26:19.740 --> 26:21.002
Actually, it might be.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.838
Paul is positive he knows
who the killer is.

26:23.880 --> 26:26.644
I know the guards
are a bit much,

26:26.680 --> 26:28.147
but I wanted everyone
to feel safe.

26:28.180 --> 26:30.944
And, besides,
math has been good to me.

26:30.990 --> 26:31.843
Commodities.

26:31.890 --> 26:33.687
So, you and your friends,

26:33.720 --> 26:35.984
you were competitors
in Belphegor's Prime?

26:36.020 --> 26:37.920
Most of us. Some of the others
are just here for the math.

26:37.960 --> 26:39.848
You said you could
identify the killer.

26:39.890 --> 26:41.926
I can, sort of.

26:44.930 --> 26:46.966
"Mo Shellshocker."

26:47.000 --> 26:49.730
PAUL: It's a pseudonym,
obviously, but I'm telling you,

26:49.770 --> 26:50.930
this is the guy
you're looking for.

26:50.970 --> 26:52.198
HARLAN:
I've heard of him.

26:52.240 --> 26:53.969
He uses his blog
to expose bad math.

26:54.010 --> 26:56.672
Corrupt economists, biased
pollsters, that sort of thing.

26:56.710 --> 26:58.109
He's actually
sort of a crusader.

26:58.150 --> 26:59.139
He's a murderer.

26:59.180 --> 27:01.910
How can you be
so sure?

27:01.950 --> 27:03.372
When he isn't crusading,
he's competing in puzzle hunts.

27:03.420 --> 27:04.717
A few months ago,

27:04.750 --> 27:05.978
he claimed to
have solved

27:06.020 --> 27:07.715
Cicada _3301 two
years In a row.

27:07.760 --> 27:10.115
Some people called BS,
including...

27:10.160 --> 27:12.856
Ike Wallaczek
and Byron Lowenthal.

27:12.890 --> 27:13.891
WATSON:
"WallaCheckYourMath,"

27:13.930 --> 27:15.192
"ByLow2020."

27:15.230 --> 27:16.424
Those are their
online handles.

27:16.460 --> 27:18.064
Their friends
will confirm it.

27:18.100 --> 27:20.193
A flame war does not
a murderer make.

27:20.230 --> 27:22.994
The stuff these guys were
slinging at each other was ugly.

27:23.040 --> 27:25.008
Mo knew they were into hunts,
and so he built one

27:25.040 --> 27:26.928
that would send them to places
where he could kill them.

27:26.970 --> 27:28.130
That's what we're
d0Ing here Is

27:28.180 --> 27:29.670
we're just sifting
through all the math

27:29.710 --> 27:31.041
he's posted on his blog
over the years,

27:31.080 --> 27:32.741
to see if we could
find his signature

27:32.780 --> 27:34.839
or something that
could identify him.

27:34.880 --> 27:37.940
If two people weren't dead,
we'd probably be having fun.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.446
But still, the
chances that he left

27:39.490 --> 27:41.253
something like that
in his math...

27:41.290 --> 27:43.679
If it's there, we'll find it.
In the meantime,

27:43.730 --> 27:44.879
we thought the
police should know

27:44.930 --> 27:46.386
who they're really
dealing with.

27:46.430 --> 27:47.988
WATSON:
I've got to go meet someone

27:48.030 --> 27:49.759
about my other case.

27:49.800 --> 27:52.769
You're good to pass all this
along to Marcus? Okay.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.860
I must say, I'm surprised you
didn't offer to stay and help.

27:55.900 --> 27:57.902
Mr. Ettinger makes
a compelling case with respect

27:57.940 --> 27:59.862
to M0 Shellshocker's
viability as a suspect.

27:59.910 --> 28:01.832
M0 is a genius.

28:01.880 --> 28:03.302
We're talking off the charts.

28:03.340 --> 28:04.898
Leibniz meets Euler meets Gauss.

28:04.950 --> 28:07.077
Huh.
He may have an ego,

28:07.110 --> 28:08.919
but he's not gonna kill
anyone over a few comments.

28:08.950 --> 28:11.089
So, while "The League of
Concerned Mathematicians"

28:11.120 --> 28:13.884
chases its tail up there, I
am gonna do the smart thing

28:13.920 --> 28:15.182
and get out of town.

28:15.220 --> 28:17.188
You can let me know
when It all blows over.

28:17.220 --> 28:19.085
You're not going
anywhere, Harlan.

28:19.130 --> 28:21.951
Or should I call you
Mo Shellshocker?

28:25.530 --> 28:27.361
Did you honestly think
I wouldn't recognize

28:27.400 --> 28:28.936
an anagram of my own name?

28:28.970 --> 28:33.339
I knew I should've gone
with "Choker Hell Moss."

28:33.370 --> 28:35.270
But I never thought
that you would see it, okay?

28:35.310 --> 28:37.039
Math is my thing, not yours.

28:37.080 --> 28:39.173
It's my name, Harlan;
that makes it my thing.

28:39.210 --> 28:41.349
It was an homage.

28:41.380 --> 28:42.938
Explain.

28:42.980 --> 28:44.948
Every day, all over the world,

28:44.990 --> 28:47.083
math is used to trick people.

28:47.120 --> 28:49.816
Data dredging to sell
pharmaceuticals.

28:49.860 --> 28:52.454
Pub_lica_tion bias
to justIfy wars.

28:52.490 --> 28:55.095
In the wrong hands, math can be
manipulated, abused.

28:55.130 --> 28:58.167
And I decided to do
something about it.

28:59.970 --> 29:02.268
You catch people
who murder other people.

29:02.300 --> 29:04.200
I catch people who murder math.

29:04.240 --> 29:07.164
According to this,
M0 is a wanted man.

29:10.380 --> 29:12.974
Hanan?

29:13.010 --> 29:16.138
The D.O.D. was working
on a new fighter.

29:16.180 --> 29:20.082
Only, I knew that the
performance stats were bogus.

29:20.120 --> 29:22.088
A friend of mine found
the internal numbers,

29:22.120 --> 29:24.054
and I sort of published them.

29:24.090 --> 29:26.058
So you put classified
Department of Defense documents

29:26.090 --> 29:27.899
on the Internet.

29:27.930 --> 29:29.227
Isn't that what
you would have done?

29:31.930 --> 29:34.398
Fine! I screwed up, okay?

29:34.440 --> 29:36.533
But, hey, that's what I do,
right? I screw up.

29:36.570 --> 29:39.004
IfI didn't, then probably you
wouldn't have secretly fired me.

29:39.040 --> 29:40.928
Excuse me?

29:40.980 --> 29:42.208
I know about Indira Patel!

29:43.980 --> 29:46.141
I know you replaced me.

29:48.220 --> 29:51.781
Kitty, I think
we could use some tea.

29:54.190 --> 29:57.079
Just tell me.

29:57.120 --> 29:59.088
Tell me what math I got wrong.

29:59.130 --> 30:02.099
Tell me why you didn't let me
make it up to you.

30:02.130 --> 30:05.520
It wasn't the maths, it was you.

30:07.570 --> 30:11.062
Your work was impeccable.

30:11.110 --> 30:13.169
And for the most part,
I enjoyed our collaborations.

30:13.210 --> 30:17.601
B-But over time, you just...
you became quite... needy.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.244
What are you talking about?

30:19.280 --> 30:22.113
Y-You asked my advice
on-on social matters,

30:22.150 --> 30:25.278
and you even invited me
to a party.

30:25.320 --> 30:27.413
You were my friend.

30:27.450 --> 30:29.179
I was your employer, Harlan.

30:29.220 --> 30:30.881
A-And you were my consultant.

30:30.930 --> 30:32.181
One of many.

30:32.230 --> 30:36.553
I know that I'm a little
obsessed with what I do.

30:36.600 --> 30:39.967
That has always made it hard
to make friends.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.390
And I used to feel pretty bad
about that, and then I met you.

30:43.440 --> 30:45.408
And I thought to myself,

30:45.440 --> 30:48.500
hey, if it doesn't bother him,
why should I let it bother me?

30:52.950 --> 30:56.579
I got a lot
out of the work that we did.

30:56.620 --> 30:59.180
A lot.

30:59.220 --> 31:04.089
But if someone like you thinks
that I'm a loser, then...

31:15.500 --> 31:18.003
WATSON (over laptop):
Hey, are we still doing this?

31:18.040 --> 31:19.166
Doing what?

31:19.210 --> 31:21.337
Talking about the case.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.109
You're just sitting there.

31:23.140 --> 31:25.199
I'm thinking.

31:25.250 --> 31:27.206
I suspect the silence
is exacerbated

31:29.280 --> 31:30.679
Yes. Well, I don't
live there anymore.

31:30.720 --> 31:32.540
So, if you want
to talk shop at night,

31:32.590 --> 31:34.410
this is the best I can do.

31:34.460 --> 31:38.282
Keep asking myself:
what did the killer want?

31:38.330 --> 31:41.254
He went to great lengths to lure
brilliant mathematicians

31:41.300 --> 31:42.358
to their deaths.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.425
Winnowed out
the less gifted

31:44.470 --> 31:47.121
by making his problems
more and more complicated.

31:47.170 --> 31:50.435
He had a type, but I still think
he's a serial killer

31:50.470 --> 31:52.301
only in the most
technical sense.

31:52.340 --> 31:54.308
He tortured both his victims.

31:54.340 --> 31:55.978
But there's no sign
that he enjoyed it.

31:56.010 --> 31:57.432
The_work was
utIIItarIan,

31:57.480 --> 31:59.539
suggesting it was
less for pleasure

31:59.580 --> 32:03.072
and more for persuasion.

32:03.120 --> 32:05.042
He wanted something.

32:05.090 --> 32:06.648
But what?

32:06.690 --> 32:09.352
Maybe there's a connection
between Wallaczek and Lowenthal

32:09.390 --> 32:11.358
we haven't spotted yet.

32:11.390 --> 32:13.324
Maybe they were working
on a project together,

32:13.360 --> 32:14.998
something that was worth
a lot of money.

32:15.030 --> 32:16.998
There's no way the killer
could have predicted

32:17.030 --> 32:19.225
which competitors would make it
to the terminal stage.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.966
That part of the game
was beyond his control.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.638
If it weren't,
he would've been prepared

32:23.670 --> 32:26.207
to dispose of a body
the size of Ike Wallaczek's.

32:26.240 --> 32:28.299
So, even if there were a
connection between the victims,

32:28.340 --> 32:30.171
the killer could not
have counted on them

32:30.210 --> 32:31.973
being lured into his trap.

32:32.010 --> 32:34.171
Certainly not
in sequence.

32:34.220 --> 32:38.042
His game was, in many respects,
one of chance.

32:40.050 --> 32:44.680
Suggesting he knows what
he wants, but not who has it.

32:44.730 --> 32:47.995
Like he was on a puzzle hunt
of his own.

32:48.030 --> 32:49.998
(door closes)

32:50.030 --> 32:51.588
KITTY:
I'm back.

32:56.100 --> 32:58.409
I'll set up
downstairs, yeah?

33:02.310 --> 33:04.278
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier.

33:04.310 --> 33:06.778
I've decided to engage her
one more time

33:06.810 --> 33:08.414
with regards
to her recuperation.

33:10.380 --> 33:14.612
I doubt she'll listen,
but I'll keep you apprised.

33:19.160 --> 33:20.479
I've been thinking.

33:20.530 --> 33:22.657
About?
You.
Your history.

33:22.700 --> 33:25.021
Your decision
not to seek help.

33:25.070 --> 33:27.561
I think it's
a mistake.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.568
Oh?

33:29.600 --> 33:31.363
I've looked into a number
of support groups.

33:31.410 --> 33:32.638
As you are well aware,

33:32.670 --> 33:34.638
I have benefited greatly
from similar settings.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.238
You have.

33:36.280 --> 33:37.633
The process, I find,

33:37.680 --> 33:39.102
_ _ is not unlike
v0IdIng one's bowels...

33:39.150 --> 33:40.777
I'll go.
What?

33:40.810 --> 33:42.471
I'll go.
Just get me the details.

33:45.220 --> 33:48.383
I've been thinking, too-- about
your number-cruncher, Harlan.

33:48.420 --> 33:50.217
You think I was
too hard on him.

33:50.260 --> 33:51.682
You will have consultants
of your own one day.

33:51.730 --> 33:54.494
You'll see that they require
management and focus.

33:54.530 --> 33:57.294
They are but keys on a keyboard,
and we're the typists.

33:57.330 --> 33:59.298
You could've given him
a shoeing for all I care.

33:59.330 --> 34:00.820
No, I'm just saying that

34:00.870 --> 34:03.168
some of the stuff he's got
up to, it's quite good.

34:03.200 --> 34:04.565
You should take a look.

34:06.440 --> 34:08.601
You may find a fellow typist.

34:11.810 --> 34:14.347
(phone ringing)

34:14.380 --> 34:16.371
Hello?

34:16.420 --> 34:18.388
MAN (American accent): Yeah, I
hear that you and some friends

34:18.420 --> 34:21.082
are trying to identify
Mo Shellshocker.

34:21.120 --> 34:22.678
That's right. Who is this?

34:22.720 --> 34:25.757
His name is Harlan Emple.

34:25.790 --> 34:27.223
You got a pen?

34:27.260 --> 34:29.319
I'll-I'll give you his address.

34:41.910 --> 34:43.434
Hanan.

34:43.480 --> 34:45.801
You can't take a hint, can you?

34:45.850 --> 34:47.340
I got your text messages.

34:47.380 --> 34:48.472
I don't want to see you
right now.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.476
So if you came here
to apologize...

34:50.520 --> 34:52.647
Actually, I came here
to spare you an agonizing death.

34:53.750 --> 34:55.479
Can I come in?

34:55.520 --> 34:57.818
I was puzzling earlier

34:57.860 --> 35:01.489
as to why the killer went
to such specific lengths.

35:01.530 --> 35:03.293
What did he want?

35:03.330 --> 35:05.389
And then Watson,
quite by accident,

35:05.430 --> 35:07.159
she made a most
compeIIIng analogy.

35:07.200 --> 35:09.634
She said it was as if he
was on a hunt of his own.

35:09.670 --> 35:12.332
Duh. He was hunting
mathematicians.

35:12.370 --> 35:13.166
No, he wasn't.

35:13.210 --> 35:14.677
He was hunting a mathematician.

35:14.710 --> 35:16.405
One.

35:16.440 --> 35:19.170
A man who had concealed
his identity not only

35:19.210 --> 35:20.700
from the mathematics
communIty at large,

35:20.750 --> 35:22.513
but also from the FBI.

35:22.550 --> 35:24.882
A "crusader,"
you might call him.

35:24.920 --> 35:26.342
Wait a minute.

35:26.390 --> 35:28.278
Are you saying that
this was all about me?

35:43.300 --> 35:46.201
HOLMES: Unfortunately, emulating
the work of people like me

35:46.240 --> 35:48.504
is not without risks.

35:48.540 --> 35:49.837
Creates enemies.

35:49.880 --> 35:52.371
I knew it was the government.

35:52.410 --> 35:53.775
It was a lottery winner.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.838
Little over a year ago,

35:56.880 --> 35:59.280
you started a series of blogs
where you exposed the flaws

35:59.320 --> 36:01.379
in certain scratch card
lottery games.

36:01.420 --> 36:03.559
Tickets like this one.

36:03.590 --> 36:05.421
I wrote about
baited hook games.

36:05.460 --> 36:07.587
Games where the numbers
are prInted on the front.

36:07.630 --> 36:10.554
Scratch off the hidden numbers,
hope for a match.

36:10.600 --> 36:12.921
Only, you proved that with
careful mathematical analysis

36:12.970 --> 36:15.336
of the visible numbers,
you could predict

36:15.370 --> 36:17.930
which tickets were winners
80% of the time.

36:17.970 --> 36:19.506
If you had exploited

36:19.540 --> 36:21.679
this flaw,
rather than exposing it,

36:21.710 --> 36:23.371
you could have made millions.

36:23.410 --> 36:25.605
Well... sure.
But that would been cheating.

36:25.650 --> 36:26.776
Right.

36:26.810 --> 36:28.471
So imagine
for a moment

36:28.520 --> 36:30.647
that you are a less
honest mathematician.

36:30.680 --> 36:32.318
Right?

36:32.350 --> 36:33.681
You've been taking
advantage of these games

36:33.720 --> 36:37.315
for a couple of years to
amass a small fortune.

36:37.360 --> 36:38.827
And then "Mo"
comes along.

36:38.860 --> 36:41.294
He starts exposing
the broken games.

36:41.330 --> 36:43.651
State lottery commissions
shut them down.

36:43.700 --> 36:46.294
The exploitable
games dry up.

36:46.330 --> 36:49.834
Now, if you were a
psychopathic lottery cheat,

36:51.840 --> 36:53.808
You kill Mo.

36:53.840 --> 36:56.536
HOLMES:
Unfortunately, M0 is elusive.

36:56.580 --> 36:57.933
Anonymous.

36:57.980 --> 37:00.540
The only thing
he knew about him for sure

37:00.580 --> 37:03.777
was that he could not resist
a puzzle hunt.

37:03.820 --> 37:06.482
Now, if you were smart enough
to identify

37:06.520 --> 37:08.750
and take advantage of
broken lottery games...

37:08.790 --> 37:11.258
Then I'm smart enough
to design a puzzle hunt.

37:11.290 --> 37:14.726
This plan was not
without its flaws.

37:14.760 --> 37:18.298
Once a competitor
reached the terminal stage,

37:18.330 --> 37:22.266
the killer could not be certain
that he'd trapped Mo, could he?

37:22.300 --> 37:23.836
So he tortured them.

37:23.870 --> 37:26.407
I submit he forced them to
log on to Mo's Web site,

37:26.440 --> 37:28.829
and when they failed...

37:32.310 --> 37:33.743
the game was compromised.

37:33.780 --> 37:35.509
So the killer devises
a Plan "B."

37:35.550 --> 37:36.744
He tricks

37:36.780 --> 37:38.589
a group of his peers

37:38.620 --> 37:40.417
into helping search
for an alternative means

37:40.450 --> 37:41.986
of identifying Mo.

37:45.860 --> 37:47.748
You're talking about that guy.

37:47.790 --> 37:49.052
The one with the penthouse.

37:49.100 --> 37:52.297
Paul?

37:52.330 --> 37:54.434
Lottery winners
are public record.

37:54.470 --> 37:56.961
So when I searched_for
the names of repeat WInners

37:57.000 --> 37:58.831
in the dates prior
to your posts...

37:58.870 --> 38:00.633
I can't believe
I drank his water.

38:00.670 --> 38:01.978
I called him.

38:02.010 --> 38:04.035
I identified you as Mo.

38:04.080 --> 38:05.502
And I gave him your address.

38:05.550 --> 38:06.801
You what?!

38:10.550 --> 38:12.518
Drop your weapon!

38:12.550 --> 38:14.017
HOLMES:
I did not, however, give him

38:14.050 --> 38:15.381
the correct apartment number.

38:15.420 --> 38:17.718
_ He was arrested
a |Ittle over an hour ago.

38:17.760 --> 38:20.320
(exhales)

38:20.360 --> 38:21.019
Tried to call you to
tell you, but, um...

38:21.060 --> 38:22.925
But I was ignoring you.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.359
Yes, you were ignoring me.

38:24.400 --> 38:25.594
Look, you know

38:25.630 --> 38:26.767
that I'm still screwed, right?

38:26.800 --> 38:28.734
You told him that I'm Mo.

38:28.770 --> 38:31.568
He's gonna tell the police,
they're gonna tell the FBI...

38:31.610 --> 38:32.963
The NYPD is under
the impression

38:33.010 --> 38:34.807
that I lied_about
your connectIon to M0

38:34.840 --> 38:37.377
in order to draw
Mr. EttInger out.

38:37.410 --> 38:38.946
As far as the
FBI goes, well,

38:38.980 --> 38:41.369
I've got some associates
who have created a trail

38:41.420 --> 38:43.115
which will
strongly suggest that Mo

38:43.150 --> 38:45.118
is a cyber-terrorist
I became aware of

38:45.150 --> 38:47.584
whilst working for, um...

38:47.620 --> 38:49.019
queen and country.

38:49.060 --> 38:51.483
You_r secret's
qUIte safe.

38:51.530 --> 38:53.327
Thanks.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.992
My reasons for preserving you
are entirely selfish, Harlan.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.661
YOU are a tremendous asset.

39:02.700 --> 39:05.134
I have little doubt

39:05.170 --> 39:08.207
I will need your help again
in the future.

39:12.080 --> 39:14.071
(doorbell rings)

39:15.950 --> 39:17.975
Me or him?

39:18.020 --> 39:19.009
You.

39:19.050 --> 39:20.540
I have an update on
that real estate flipper.

39:20.590 --> 39:21.955
I thought you might
want to know.

39:28.030 --> 39:30.590
I tracked down the truck rental
receIpts to get her name.

39:30.630 --> 39:31.824
Valerie Cork.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.565
She's an art authenticator.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.488
And that crate you saw?

39:35.540 --> 39:37.132
There was
something called

39:37.170 --> 39:39.638
a scanning fluorescence
spectrometry machine inside.

39:39.670 --> 39:40.932
They're used...
To find paintings

39:40.970 --> 39:42.471
underneath other paintings.

39:42.510 --> 39:43.932
So it turns out
that the building

39:43.980 --> 39:45.641
Chad Keswick was looking to buy

39:45.680 --> 39:47.739
was leased by the WPA
during the Depression.

39:47.780 --> 39:49.611
They commissioned a
mural for the lobby.

39:49.650 --> 39:52.084
The artist was a_
notorIous communIst,

39:52.120 --> 39:54.111
so when the property passed
into private hands in the '505,

39:54.150 --> 39:55.686
the new owners
had it painted over.

39:55.720 --> 39:57.608
But it was still there,
under the paint.

39:57.660 --> 39:59.787
A lost work by Diego Rivera.

39:59.830 --> 40:01.991
It's worth ten times
the price of the building.

40:03.660 --> 40:05.560
I was hoping to leak
the truth to the Times.

40:06.800 --> 40:08.768
I promised you a cut of my fee.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.859
But I'm pretty sure
the mural's gonna end up

40:10.900 --> 40:13.130
in the hands of
a historical trust.

40:13.170 --> 40:15.104
I'd feel obligated
to refund my client,

40:15.140 --> 40:16.903
which means you'd get
a cut of nothing.

40:18.010 --> 40:20.149
That works for me.

40:20.180 --> 40:22.011
Okay.

40:24.150 --> 40:26.118
I think you should know

40:26.150 --> 40:28.459
that I am going
to a meeting tonight.

40:30.590 --> 40:34.151
One of those
support groups for...

40:34.190 --> 40:36.021
people like me.

40:36.060 --> 40:38.563
It was, uh, Sherlock's idea.

40:38.600 --> 40:40.522
That's great.

40:40.570 --> 40:42.128
I know you put him up to it.

40:42.170 --> 40:43.899
We talked.

40:46.540 --> 40:48.872
When he first approached me
in London,

40:48.910 --> 40:52.243
I was...

40:52.280 --> 40:54.248
in a bad way.

40:54.280 --> 40:56.919
And I had been for a while.

40:56.950 --> 40:59.817
Butthen,
when he talked about

40:59.850 --> 41:01.078
the work that he did,

41:01.120 --> 41:04.624
about the things
that he saw in me...

41:07.190 --> 41:08.691
I want it.

41:08.730 --> 41:10.618
I want every bit
of what's he offered me,

41:10.660 --> 41:12.628
of what he offered you, but...

41:12.670 --> 41:14.934
if I've learned one thing
over the last few weeks,

41:14.970 --> 41:16.767
it's that he can't pull it off.

41:16.800 --> 41:18.461
Not by himself, anyway.

41:20.640 --> 41:22.938
And if I'm gonna get
what I want,

41:22.980 --> 41:26.472
then I'm going to need
your help, too.

41:29.220 --> 41:31.780
I still think
the meetings are bollocks,

41:31.820 --> 41:33.685
but you say they're important.

41:33.720 --> 41:36.689
They matter to you, so...

41:36.720 --> 41:38.688
What do you say, Watson?

41:38.730 --> 41:40.652
Will you help me?

41:45.070 --> 41:46.992
I don't know how it happened.

41:47.030 --> 41:50.295
Itjust... hit me.

41:50.340 --> 41:52.763
Like a truck, out of nowhere.

41:53.840 --> 41:56.707
Work is good.

41:56.740 --> 41:58.742
I have friends.

41:58.780 --> 42:01.840
I'm in a_
relatIonshIp.

42:01.880 --> 42:05.680
Somewhere along
the way, somehow,

42:05.720 --> 42:08.712
I stopped being a victim

42:08.760 --> 42:11.627
and became a survivor.

42:11.660 --> 42:15.699
So, I guess all I'm saying is,
there's hope.

42:15.730 --> 42:19.222
Do the work. Love yourself.
There's hope.

42:21.740 --> 42:22.729
