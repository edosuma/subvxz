10:09.480 --> 10:10.765
Do you speak French?

10:11.980 --> 10:12.969
Yes.

10:14.150 --> 10:15.356
For pain.

10:15.780 --> 10:17.486
You chew.

10:23.830 --> 10:25.286
She's beautiful.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.530
She has her papa's eyes.

10:32.880 --> 10:34.666
Thank you.

10:38.970 --> 10:40.756
Can you help me leave?

10:43.430 --> 10:45.216
You must heal.

10:45.730 --> 10:46.970
Johiehon.

10:48.390 --> 10:49.596
Be careful.

10:50.060 --> 10:53.359
He does not seem dangerous.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.606
This man cannot be good.

10:57.360 --> 10:59.191
He was sold by his own people.

11:00.820 --> 11:02.822
That way...

11:03.490 --> 11:04.730
Over there.

11:15.210 --> 11:17.462
May it bring you peace.

11:20.300 --> 11:22.086
Thank you, Kaheroton.

11:24.760 --> 11:27.843
We must remember...

11:27.930 --> 11:30.262
that peace begins here...

11:30.350 --> 11:32.398
as war does...

11:32.480 --> 11:35.222
in the minds of men.

14:08.510 --> 14:09.499
Kaheroton.

14:10.140 --> 14:13.212
He does not know our ways.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.097
He does not know that to point is bad...

14:16.230 --> 14:20.894
or speaking when another
is speaking is an offence.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.241
He is no good to us.

14:45.170 --> 14:46.831
You have learned nothing.

14:48.970 --> 14:51.291
Put him in the hut.

15:53.780 --> 15:54.860
Good day.

15:58.700 --> 15:59.701
Who are you?

16:00.580 --> 16:02.241
Father Alexandre.
