WHILE THIS STORY IS BASED
ON ACTUAL EVENTS,

00:07.675 --> 00:11.345
CERTAIN CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS,
AND DIALOGUE WERE FICTIONALIZED.

00:11.429 --> 00:14.932
ANY SIMILARITY TO ANY PERSON,
LIVING OR DEAD, IS FOR DRAMATIC PURPOSES.

00:27.445 --> 00:29.655
<i>Do me a favor, enjoy life.</i>

00:29.739 --> 00:32.324
<i>And if someone offers you drugs,</i>
<i>just say no.</i>

01:25.669 --> 01:27.671
MARADONA:
BLESSED DREAM

01:28.047 --> 01:29.423
BROKEN

01:34.303 --> 01:37.097
BARCELONA, SPAIN.

01:37.181 --> 01:39.433
<i>McEnroe is making ads for Rolex.</i>

01:39.517 --> 01:42.561
Didn't we come to conquer Europe, big guy?

01:42.645 --> 01:46.232
McEnroe wasn't sidelined
by hepatitis for three months.

01:46.899 --> 01:50.486
- You're blaming the hepatitis?
- And your shitty attitude.

01:50.820 --> 01:53.864
No sponsor wants a guy
who fights with everyone.

01:53.948 --> 01:56.826
Because McEnroe is Mother Teresa? Come on.

01:56.909 --> 02:00.663
Why are you going on about him?
Why don't you hire his manager?

02:00.746 --> 02:03.833
I might. At least,
he can walk like a normal person.

02:03.916 --> 02:07.586
- He's more stupid than usual.
- Why are you so cranky?

02:07.670 --> 02:09.171
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

02:09.255 --> 02:12.383
How is it I make so much money,
but it always vanishes?

02:12.466 --> 02:13.926
You make me do this bullshit.

02:14.009 --> 02:17.304
Wait, it's not my fault your money's gone.

02:17.388 --> 02:20.724
I've told you to reduce
your expenses, but you won't listen.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.977
Do you know how much
you've spent on calls?

02:23.060 --> 02:25.271
My family lives fucking miles away.

02:25.354 --> 02:28.148
Your siblings recount
<i>Chavo </i> episodes over the phone.

02:28.232 --> 02:30.651
What do you expect?
They don't carry it here.

02:30.776 --> 02:33.612
It's an international call.
It costs a fortune.

02:33.696 --> 02:36.615
I'm Diego Maradona.
If I can't call, something's wrong.

02:36.699 --> 02:39.743
It's the phone, your millionaire habits,

02:39.827 --> 02:42.079
the money you send to your parents,

02:42.204 --> 02:45.040
and providing for those
ten bums living with you.

02:45.124 --> 02:48.252
Don't mention my friends!
I'd be depressed without them.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.420
Call a taxi.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.839
- You get in.
- A taxi?

02:51.922 --> 02:54.008
I'll pay, what's the problem?

02:54.091 --> 02:56.218
- Go fuck yourself.
- You go fuck yourself.

02:56.302 --> 02:58.095
No, you go fuck yourself.

03:15.946 --> 03:20.367
Damn, he looks like a pederast
in that painting. Look at those lips.

03:20.451 --> 03:22.411
I prefer his usual ass face.

03:22.494 --> 03:24.330
Stop it, don't make me laugh.

03:24.413 --> 03:27.875
He does look a bit like a degenerate,
you're right.

03:29.168 --> 03:30.544
Let's get out of here.

03:30.628 --> 03:33.255
No, you have to make peace with this man.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.467
I've heard that his wife's nice.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.886
I hope so,
or I'll be bored to death.

03:40.304 --> 03:42.139
What a nice house.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.266
- Yes, too fancy.
- Is that bad?

03:44.683 --> 03:46.477
It smells like old people.

03:47.603 --> 03:50.439
- Shut up, you're so critical.
- Yes.

03:51.440 --> 03:56.445
Oh, no. They set the table for three.
I wasn't invited. This is embarrassing.

03:56.946 --> 03:58.364
Hello.

03:59.281 --> 04:01.116
Yes. Thank you.

04:03.285 --> 04:04.536
Thank you very much.

04:05.537 --> 04:07.915
- Diego, Claudia, darling.
- Hi.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.418
- Thanks for coming.
- How are you?

04:11.502 --> 04:12.753
I'm fine.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.755
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

04:14.838 --> 04:15.923
You were invited.

04:16.006 --> 04:19.635
She saw three plates
and thought she wasn't invited.

04:19.718 --> 04:24.098
Yes. It'll only be the three of us,
because my wife's feeling unwell.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.225
What a shame.

04:26.308 --> 04:30.020
Listen, I have an exquisite
Chambord Liqueur Royale.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.193
Thank you.

04:41.782 --> 04:45.744
Lord, bless this food
that we're about to eat

04:45.828 --> 04:48.414
and grant that there may be
no hunger in the world.

04:49.206 --> 04:50.040
Amen.

04:50.249 --> 04:51.333
- Amen.
- Amen.

04:53.335 --> 04:54.336
They're oysters.

04:56.005 --> 04:56.964
Enjoy your meal.

05:03.804 --> 05:08.976
You could say that a big part of my temper
is due to my mother.

05:09.059 --> 05:11.228
A cantankerous Biscayan.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.313
I was born in Bilbao,

05:13.439 --> 05:17.443
but I lived in the town of Baracaldo,
famous for its ladies' handball.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.445
How interesting.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.363
The shrimp is from Palamós.

05:21.864 --> 05:23.407
You can use your hands.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.993
- My hands?
- Yes, certainly.

05:28.037 --> 05:31.248
Well, eventually, I disobeyed my father

05:31.331 --> 05:33.208
who wanted me to be a lawyer.

05:33.292 --> 05:36.086
Instead, I worked
in the construction business,

05:36.170 --> 05:39.173
so I was able to dedicate myself

05:39.256 --> 05:41.759
to my other great passion,
which is soccer.

05:42.426 --> 05:43.427
You'll like that.

05:44.344 --> 05:48.390
Football Club Barcelona is
not only a great showcase for soccer,

05:48.474 --> 05:53.187
but it's also a model club
in terms of family values and behavior.

05:53.270 --> 05:57.191
As the president,
I've been in the public eye for years.

05:57.274 --> 05:59.193
And I've never had any scandals,

05:59.276 --> 06:03.280
nor rumors of affairs with women
other than my wife.

06:07.409 --> 06:10.162
I often see myself reflected
in your outbursts,

06:10.245 --> 06:13.165
but, in public,
my reactions are different,

06:13.248 --> 06:15.709
as I have to look after
the interests of the club.

06:15.793 --> 06:19.088
But I listened to you,
and I fired Udo Lattek.

06:19.171 --> 06:22.466
So, when you recover from hepatitis,
you'll feel comfortable.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.594
- The papers say otherwise.
- Really? What?

06:25.677 --> 06:30.682
They say Schuster called Lattek
a "fucking drunk,"

06:30.766 --> 06:34.561
and Lattek told you to choose
between Schuster or him,

06:34.645 --> 06:35.854
and you chose Schuster.

06:35.938 --> 06:38.732
Well, the press twists everything.

06:39.191 --> 06:41.110
You're telling me.

06:41.527 --> 06:44.947
Your journalist friends are saying
I had... What was it?

06:45.030 --> 06:47.241
- Gonorrhea.
- Gonorrhea instead of hepatitis.

06:48.492 --> 06:51.912
I admit that I've been wrong
about you sometimes, Diego.

06:51.995 --> 06:55.457
But it's just that when I feel undermined,

06:55.541 --> 06:57.876
I get carried away
by my Basque temperament.

06:58.293 --> 07:00.879
Anyway, we have to start getting along.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.133
That's why I decided to come tonight.

07:04.675 --> 07:08.762
I suppose you're happy to have
a coach to your liking, like Menotti.

07:09.138 --> 07:12.850
I'm sure he'll let you sleep in
on game days.

07:13.892 --> 07:15.310
He knows me well.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.771
- Well, then, let's toast.
- Sure.

07:17.896 --> 07:20.691
To a season full of success.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.151
- Okay, cheers.
- Cheers.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.659
<i>How are you? How do you feel?</i>

07:31.201 --> 07:33.245
- Dying to play.
- Of course.

07:33.328 --> 07:37.124
But I'm also worried,
because hepatitis took its toll on me.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.293
I'm afraid I won't get back to my level.

07:39.376 --> 07:41.587
Don't worry, I brought you the best.

07:41.670 --> 07:44.131
Professor, I need you for a minute.

07:45.215 --> 07:48.802
Professor Signorini is a rarity in soccer.

07:48.886 --> 07:52.431
He looks more like a university professor
than a physical trainer.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.602
I want to introduce you to a new kid.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.354
Nice to meet you.

07:59.438 --> 08:02.649
Explain to him
your research on biorhythms.

08:02.733 --> 08:05.027
Yes, there's a very interesting theory

08:05.110 --> 08:08.906
that says that we have
rhythmic biological cycles.

08:09.031 --> 08:12.826
And they affect us in different ways.
Emotionally, physically.

08:14.203 --> 08:17.539
<i>I want to see what your body has to say</i>
<i>and work on that.</i>

08:17.623 --> 08:19.082
<i>Your body has a lot to say.</i>

08:19.499 --> 08:22.044
I hope that my body speaks better
than I do.

08:22.127 --> 08:25.172
Every time I open my mouth,
I get into all kinds of trouble.

08:26.298 --> 08:28.175
- Thank you.
- Please, excuse me.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.636
While you're getting ready, Diego,

08:30.719 --> 08:32.638
I need your help with the team.

08:33.597 --> 08:36.725
It's like they're afraid to play.
They have no confidence.

08:36.808 --> 08:39.770
I want them to get the ball,
to keep it, to play.

08:39.853 --> 08:42.814
- Help me with that.
- Of course, César, I will.

08:42.898 --> 08:45.776
Just be patient. Lattek was training

08:45.859 --> 08:47.903
- soldiers instead of players.
- Yes.

08:57.371 --> 09:00.832
<i>Barcelona is taking the field</i>
<i>for this latest game.</i>

09:00.916 --> 09:02.501
<i>They're up against Real Betis.</i>

09:02.584 --> 09:07.381
<i>Diego's doing his warm-up exercises</i>
<i>before the start of the game.</i>

09:07.506 --> 09:09.049
<i>Diego!</i>

09:09.132 --> 09:10.717
<i>Lots support in the stands.</i>

09:10.801 --> 09:13.345
<i>Both club presidents are in the box,</i>

09:13.428 --> 09:16.265
<i>and César Luis Menotti</i>
<i>makes his debut with Barcelona.</i>

09:21.603 --> 09:23.605
<i>After being sidelined for so long,</i>

09:23.689 --> 09:26.608
<i>stepping onto the field is</i>
<i>like living again,</i>

09:26.692 --> 09:29.152
<i>but my legs weigh a hundred pounds.</i>

09:29.653 --> 09:32.781
<i>I barely touch two balls</i>
<i>and already regret being there.</i>

09:32.864 --> 09:34.491
<i>I can't handle the contact.</i>

09:38.745 --> 09:42.332
<i>I'm as predictable as the next player.</i>

09:42.416 --> 09:45.002
<i>Menotti kept me in out of respect.</i>

09:45.085 --> 09:46.837
<i>I should have gone after five.</i>

09:54.261 --> 09:56.263
<i>I've never experienced that before.</i>

09:57.556 --> 09:59.766
<i>The crowd started to whistle at me.</i>

09:59.850 --> 10:02.311
<i>Be patient. What does Menotti say?</i>

10:02.394 --> 10:05.564
He says that the magic will come back,

10:05.897 --> 10:08.817
that I shouldn't worry,
but it's only to encourage me.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.861
<i>Why would he? Trust him, son.</i>

10:11.278 --> 10:12.904
<i>I can go back to the mill.</i>

10:13.280 --> 10:16.116
Dad, just because I'm having
a hard time doesn't mean

10:16.199 --> 10:20.787
we'll go back to Fiorito,
and you'll go back to work at the mill.

10:21.246 --> 10:22.247
Diego!

10:22.664 --> 10:23.665
Diego!

10:25.334 --> 10:26.585
Will you stop training?

10:27.377 --> 10:31.256
Professor Signorini told you
not to overdo it.

10:32.257 --> 10:36.345
Look at you, all sweaty. Let go!

10:37.554 --> 10:40.640
Stop it. Come on.

10:40.724 --> 10:42.601
What's all this?

10:44.686 --> 10:45.979
You didn't ask Claudia?

10:46.355 --> 10:49.775
We're going hunting 200 miles from here.

10:49.858 --> 10:53.528
If we leave now, we'll get there tonight
and be back tomorrow.

10:53.612 --> 10:55.447
No, it's fine. Go.

10:55.947 --> 10:58.158
Go. It'll be good for you
to have some fun.

10:58.241 --> 10:59.117
- Really?
- Yes.

10:59.201 --> 11:00.744
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.621
- Don't forget to shower.
- Okay.

11:06.708 --> 11:08.877
Galindez, why are you all dressed up?

11:09.795 --> 11:11.922
It's the nightclub's anniversary.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.299
Are you going for a jog or something?

11:26.353 --> 11:28.939
You set this whole sham up
to go to a nightclub?

11:31.316 --> 11:34.403
The shotguns, the coolers,
the outfits, everything.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.571
All a show to fool me?

11:36.655 --> 11:38.949
How can you be such an asshole, Diego?

11:39.032 --> 11:41.410
Why are you dressed like that, Galindez?

11:42.452 --> 11:44.788
Don't you remember
we were going hunting today?

11:45.163 --> 11:46.915
Oh, that was today.

11:46.998 --> 11:49.626
No, there's no need. That's it.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.671
I may look like I'm stupid, but I'm not.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.464
Hold on a sec, honey.

11:54.798 --> 11:59.428
Did you arrange all this bullshit
to drag me into a nightclub? You know me.

12:17.446 --> 12:19.197
You're such an asshole, Galindez.

12:19.781 --> 12:23.034
I'm gonna kick your ass
back to Buenos Aires.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.957
Okay.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.503
Where's your little foot?

12:35.380 --> 12:37.382
- Are you waiting for a client?
- No.

12:38.008 --> 12:39.426
Don't answer.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.178
Carlos, stop being paranoid.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.888
They're looking for me.

12:42.971 --> 12:46.016
Who? It's better to lose you
than to find you.

12:47.184 --> 12:48.852
Cut me a line.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.688
Want me to paint your nails
or cut you a line?

12:51.771 --> 12:52.689
Both.

13:01.615 --> 13:02.824
Give me that.

13:03.575 --> 13:06.161
Be patient.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.832
Here, here, here.

13:21.635 --> 13:22.594
I'll go see.

13:28.099 --> 13:29.059
Who is it?

13:29.684 --> 13:33.063
Mauricio Mendez, journalist
from the<i> Primicias </i> newspaper.

13:33.271 --> 13:35.065
I'm looking for Carlos Ferro Viera.

13:35.148 --> 13:38.944
No, you have the wrong address.
I don't know anyone by that name.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.654
You're Marilú, aren't you?

13:40.737 --> 13:43.698
I'm a friend of Valverde's,
Tano Valverde, from Caix.

13:44.533 --> 13:46.576
How did Carlos screw up this time?

13:46.660 --> 13:48.745
Well, I'd like to know that, too.

13:49.037 --> 13:51.998
He has an arrest warrant out
for the Maradona case.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.877
- I have no idea where he is.
- Okay.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.880
Look, I'm going to give you my number,

14:00.006 --> 14:03.260
in case he gets in touch.
It's for an interview,

14:03.385 --> 14:06.888
so he can tell us what happened
to Diego before his hospitalization.

14:07.264 --> 14:09.933
To be clear, there's no risk involved.

14:10.308 --> 14:13.395
Will you pay for it?
People charge for stories now.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.689
It depends on what Carlos has to say.

14:16.106 --> 14:17.524
If he gets in touch,

14:17.607 --> 14:20.318
not that I think he will,
I'll tell him about this.

14:20.652 --> 14:22.112
Okay. All right.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.214
Hello.

15:13.705 --> 15:15.290
I'll come with you.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.862
<i>A new round in this Spanish league.</i>

15:45.945 --> 15:49.449
<i>Barcelona Football Club is</i>
<i>on the field and there is Diego.</i>

15:49.532 --> 15:52.327
<i>El Flaco Menotti is on the bench,</i>

15:52.410 --> 15:55.872
<i>waiting for everything</i>
<i>to unravel just as planned.</i>

15:59.584 --> 16:02.796
<i>A pass to Maradona,</i>
<i>and it's a goal for Barcelona.</i>

16:02.879 --> 16:03.963
<i>Diego Maradona.</i>

16:04.047 --> 16:08.385
<i>Maradona lines it up, he aims,</i>
<i>he kicks the ball into the goal.</i>

16:08.468 --> 16:10.637
<i>Goal for Barca at the start of the game.</i>

16:10.720 --> 16:12.806
<i>The ball is up, Maradona has it,</i>

16:12.889 --> 16:16.935
<i>and excellent kick by Maradona,</i>
<i>great skill from the Argentine.</i>

16:17.852 --> 16:20.271
<i>Maradona enters the area</i>

16:20.355 --> 16:23.400
<i>and kicks the ball to the goal.</i>
<i>Goal for Barcelona.</i>

16:27.070 --> 16:30.365
<i>He lines up for the kick.</i>
<i>Diego Maradona shoots,</i>

16:30.448 --> 16:32.325
<i>and the ball bounces off the post.</i>

16:32.784 --> 16:37.038
<i>A pass to the goal area and a header.</i>
<i>It's Maradona and goal.</i>

16:37.122 --> 16:40.166
<i>Goal for Barca, Diego Armando Maradona.</i>

16:41.251 --> 16:45.672
<i>Maradona shoots, evading two,</i>
<i>a double dribble, a pass to Carrasco,</i>

16:45.755 --> 16:50.677
<i>and Maradona shoots,</i>
<i>goal for Barcelona, Maradona.</i>

16:59.686 --> 17:04.899
If we have learned anything from Diego,
it's that together we are invincible.

17:05.233 --> 17:08.528
Therefore, in FC Barcelona, we are all,

17:08.611 --> 17:12.782
players and managers, after the same goal,
to win the Copa del Rey.

17:12.949 --> 17:17.454
Diego, isn't it risky, a few days
before a final against Real Madrid,

17:17.537 --> 17:20.957
for you and Schuster to go to Germany
to play a exhibition game?

17:21.040 --> 17:24.627
It is a commitment
that we made a while ago,

17:24.711 --> 17:27.505
and we are proud to participate

17:27.589 --> 17:30.258
in a tribute to a great player
like Paul Breitner.

17:30.341 --> 17:31.509
Fans are worried.

17:31.593 --> 17:35.138
They shouldn't worry
because in games like this,

17:35.430 --> 17:38.183
there are no injuries
or physical wear and tear.

17:38.266 --> 17:41.227
Fans can feel reassured, I mean,

17:41.352 --> 17:43.855
the board of directors has just ruled

17:43.938 --> 17:47.400
against giving the players permission
to attend this event.

17:48.026 --> 17:50.904
Why, boss?
A few days ago, you said we could go.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.615
I know, Diego,
but it's the board's decision.

17:53.698 --> 17:55.617
I can't go over their heads.

17:55.992 --> 17:57.869
Núñez, don't be ridiculous,

17:57.952 --> 18:02.248
everybody knows you choose
the brand of toilet paper at the stadium.

18:02.332 --> 18:06.669
Well, the board doesn't need
to be involved in that kind of decision.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.797
President, what's the decision?

18:08.880 --> 18:12.342
Maradona said he'd be
at Paul Breitner's farewell and he will.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.510
Thank you very much.

18:17.722 --> 18:20.225
<i>Should I pass it to you or Schuster?</i>

18:27.023 --> 18:28.691
<i>Come on, more rhythm, guys.</i>

18:28.775 --> 18:30.360
Can I ask you a question?

18:31.194 --> 18:33.571
Did you borrow money from Flaco Menotti?

18:34.864 --> 18:36.825
Where did you get that from?

18:36.908 --> 18:38.743
I read it in a gossip magazine.

18:39.327 --> 18:40.411
Is it true?

18:41.371 --> 18:42.539
It's not a loan.

18:43.581 --> 18:46.000
Flaco is a long-time friend. He offered.

18:46.751 --> 18:49.337
It's an investment to finish the film.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.344
How are the numbers going?
Diego is worried.

18:56.928 --> 18:59.138
- Did he send you to ask me?
- No, not at all.

18:59.222 --> 19:00.431
Doesn't Diego trust me?

19:00.515 --> 19:02.976
Claudia, you know me,
I'd never steal from Diego.

19:03.059 --> 19:06.396
Of course not, no one is saying that.
Diego didn't say anything.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.815
I'm worried. I'm just asking, that's all.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.736
Streaks are like that, you know?

19:14.821 --> 19:17.532
Sometimes they're good investments,
but not always.

19:17.991 --> 19:21.452
It's important not to put
all your eggs in the same basket.

19:22.453 --> 19:23.413
Yes.

19:24.372 --> 19:25.373
Maybe.

19:31.087 --> 19:32.380
Are you hungry?

19:34.924 --> 19:36.050
- Run! Run!
- Hey!

19:36.134 --> 19:38.553
- Son of a bitch.
- Fucking money-grabber!

19:38.636 --> 19:40.513
- What are you doing?
- Barca pays you!

19:40.597 --> 19:42.974
Go to Germany and you're dead!
Son of a bitch!

19:43.057 --> 19:45.393
- Diego, no!
- Come here, I'll kill you!

19:45.476 --> 19:46.644
No, Diego, come back!

19:47.729 --> 19:49.272
Watch out!

19:54.068 --> 19:56.362
Motherfuckers and where is security?

19:56.779 --> 19:59.073
- Son of a...
- This was set up by Núñez.

19:59.157 --> 20:02.201
Núñez did this,
so I don't go to Breitner's farewell.

20:02.285 --> 20:04.287
Maybe we should cancel everything.

20:04.370 --> 20:07.373
Let's not get into a war
with the club over this.

20:07.457 --> 20:09.417
Núñez started this, what do you mean?

20:09.500 --> 20:11.127
Buy the tickets and let's go.

20:11.502 --> 20:13.755
- Well, it's not that easy.
- What isn't?

20:13.838 --> 20:17.258
- We buy two tickets and go.
- The club has your passport.

20:18.676 --> 20:19.719
What?

20:19.928 --> 20:23.473
The club has your passport, Diego.

20:24.349 --> 20:27.018
Will be received in the museum, which...

20:27.143 --> 20:29.437
- You can't go in.
- Back off.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.439
Núñez, where's my passport?

20:31.522 --> 20:32.857
Excuse me.

20:32.941 --> 20:36.277
Diego, this is not
the proper way, time, or place.

20:36.361 --> 20:39.656
And you sending two assholes
to trash my car is proper?

20:39.739 --> 20:41.324
I don't understand.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.409
Don't play dumb. Where's my passport?

20:43.493 --> 20:46.621
If I give it back,
you'll only use it to disobey me.

20:50.333 --> 20:51.960
You cannot do that.

20:52.043 --> 20:53.878
Diego, this is gonna cost you.

20:53.962 --> 20:56.631
This is gonna cost you.
Where is my passport?

20:56.714 --> 20:59.258
Trash the whole club,
you're not going to Germany.

20:59.342 --> 21:02.595
I don't want to go to Germany,
but I want my passport.

21:03.346 --> 21:04.889
You wouldn't dare.

21:05.306 --> 21:06.140
Try me.

21:13.690 --> 21:15.274
MONEY-GRABBING SOUTH AMERICAN

21:21.114 --> 21:23.157
- Good morning, Raquel.
- Morning, Jorge.

21:23.533 --> 21:25.868
- Who's that?
- Achaval, the accountant.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.787
He's been waiting for you.

21:28.538 --> 21:31.416
- Achaval?
- He's Claudia's relative.

21:32.083 --> 21:35.253
- He's here on behalf of Diego.
- Thank you.

21:38.589 --> 21:40.008
Patricio Achaval.

21:40.091 --> 21:42.719
- Pleasure, Patricio, how are you?
- I'm good.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.012
Ready to start.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.514
Could you wait just a moment?

21:46.597 --> 21:49.350
- I'll make a call and be right with you.
- Yes.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.729
<i>Hi, Pelusa.</i>

21:52.812 --> 21:56.899
Sorry to bother you, man, but I have
a Patricio Achaval at the office.

21:58.026 --> 21:59.902
<i>-Who?</i>
- That's what I was wondering.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.447
Patricio Achaval, an accountant.

22:03.197 --> 22:06.617
<i>Yes, he's my father-in-law's cousin.</i>

22:06.701 --> 22:08.327
<i>I forgot to tell you.</i>

22:08.411 --> 22:10.204
<i>He's great with numbers.</i>

22:10.288 --> 22:12.999
<i>He does the accounting</i>
<i>for several companies here.</i>

22:14.125 --> 22:15.626
You could have warned me.

22:15.710 --> 22:19.964
<i>Yes, but I forgot, man. Don't worry,</i>
<i>he knows what he has to do.</i>

22:20.048 --> 22:23.426
<i>Give him a desk and whatever he wants</i>
<i>and forget about it.</i>

22:23.509 --> 22:24.677
<i>Take care, Rengo.</i>

22:25.511 --> 22:26.345
Take care.

22:34.729 --> 22:37.315
We're always saying goodbye.

22:39.817 --> 22:44.113
It'd be nice to have a normal boyfriend
who could take me to the airport.

22:54.082 --> 22:55.458
Good luck in the final.

22:56.542 --> 22:57.835
Score a goal for me.

22:58.920 --> 23:02.548
And don't worry, if you have
problems with Jorge, let me know.

23:03.758 --> 23:05.843
And you tell your stupid old man

23:05.927 --> 23:08.805
to let you stay longer next time,
'cause I miss you.

23:15.353 --> 23:16.979
- I love you.
- I love you.

23:18.981 --> 23:20.358
- Bye.
- Have a good trip.

23:22.151 --> 23:23.569
Let me get that for you.

23:25.279 --> 23:26.531
- Bye, Claudia.
- Bye.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.866
- Have a good trip.
- Thank you.

23:36.958 --> 23:39.460
Buy me some flowers.
I'm going out tonight.

23:41.754 --> 23:44.340
<i>How I wish I could never see you again</i>

23:45.049 --> 23:47.426
<i>And be brave</i>

23:49.053 --> 23:52.807
<i>To tell you that I'm better off with him</i>

23:52.890 --> 23:56.686
<i>He understands me</i>

23:56.769 --> 24:00.356
<i>He has time to spare as I do</i>

24:00.439 --> 24:03.818
<i>His blood burns like mine</i>

24:04.527 --> 24:07.989
<i>With him I feel like new</i>
<i>So willing, so whole</i>

24:08.322 --> 24:11.784
<i>A woman of flesh and blood</i>

24:12.243 --> 24:15.997
<i>How I wish I could never see you again</i>

24:16.080 --> 24:19.792
<i>How I wish I could never see you again</i>

24:19.876 --> 24:23.462
<i>How I look forward to closing</i>
<i>This chapter in my life</i>

24:23.546 --> 24:27.133
<i>Where you were a lie and nothing else</i>

24:51.073 --> 24:51.991
Hi.

24:56.996 --> 25:00.791
- Where shall I take you, miss?
- Fuck, Diego, I thought you left.

25:02.919 --> 25:05.796
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi.

25:09.967 --> 25:12.511
So familiar with the driver.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.431
Your little hat looks so cute.

25:35.368 --> 25:37.745
Don't move a fucking inch, man.

25:38.162 --> 25:39.872
No, please don't hurt me.

25:40.122 --> 25:42.041
What will Maradona pay for you?

25:42.124 --> 25:44.377
Diego can't pay, we're broke.

25:44.460 --> 25:48.422
With what Maradona earns,
I don't believe you, you piece of shit.

25:48.506 --> 25:50.633
I swear, business is bad.

25:50.716 --> 25:54.136
If Maradona won't pay
a fucking dime for you,

25:54.220 --> 25:56.764
we'll shoot you and keep the car.

25:56.847 --> 25:59.809
I'll give you the car,
but please don't kill me.

26:00.726 --> 26:02.103
I'm sorry.

26:12.113 --> 26:14.824
The look on his face
when he saw the water gun.

26:17.118 --> 26:19.787
Hey, did he really say that I'm broke?

26:20.162 --> 26:22.248
We were pointing a gun at him.

26:22.331 --> 26:24.000
He was trying to get out of it.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.252
Who are those people?

26:28.212 --> 26:29.255
I don't know.

26:29.338 --> 26:31.716
- Sorry to interrupt, Diego.
- Yes, professor.

26:31.799 --> 26:35.886
Look, I'm part of a group
of Argentine expats, those guys.

26:35.970 --> 26:37.680
Democracy is back in our country.

26:37.763 --> 26:39.807
There's a presidential campaign,

26:39.890 --> 26:43.602
so we are collecting signatures
to commit the candidates

26:44.103 --> 26:46.022
to bring the militants to trial.

26:46.105 --> 26:48.941
- They want to meet you. Are you willing?
<i>-Hi.</i>

26:49.317 --> 26:50.443
Hi.

26:50.526 --> 26:52.486
Hi, Diego. How are you?

26:52.570 --> 26:53.571
Hi.

26:53.821 --> 26:56.782
I want to apologize,
from the bottom of my heart,

26:57.033 --> 27:00.036
because soccer can sometimes be a bubble.

27:00.995 --> 27:04.081
I remember shaking hands with Videla
a while ago.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.000
Gives me the creeps.

27:06.083 --> 27:07.752
- Sign this, Diego.
- Thanks.

27:08.794 --> 27:12.465
My brother Alejandro was taken away
coming out of the university,

27:12.548 --> 27:14.884
- and we haven't heard from him.
- Thanks, Diego.

CHE'S BOLIVIAN DIARY

27:16.135 --> 27:17.553
You're reading a book?

27:19.055 --> 27:20.431
What's wrong with that?

27:21.349 --> 27:24.018
I borrowed it from Professor Signorini.

27:24.643 --> 27:28.773
This guy wasn't born poor,
but he died for the poor.

27:29.899 --> 27:33.319
Besides wasting time reading,
you're going out a lot, aren't you?

27:34.403 --> 27:37.615
- No.
- You're seeing a lot of shows.

27:38.824 --> 27:40.284
- What?
- A lot of shows.

27:41.202 --> 27:44.038
Concerts, that Argentine singer.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.332
Lorena Gaumont.

27:47.500 --> 27:50.127
Don't lie to me because I will kill you.

27:50.211 --> 27:52.546
No, Rengo and I went to see a show

27:52.630 --> 27:55.341
and they started talking nonsense.

27:55.466 --> 28:00.012
Look, there are too much details
in this magazine to be a lie,

28:00.096 --> 28:02.598
so tell me the truth, or I'll slap you.

28:02.932 --> 28:04.141
We're just friends.

28:05.601 --> 28:09.939
Okay, a little more than friends,
but you know what? I'm alone here.

28:10.022 --> 28:13.275
When Claudia is in Argentina,
I need love too.

28:13.359 --> 28:17.113
Shut up, stop trying
to justify what you can't.

28:17.905 --> 28:19.824
So, you've been seeing Lorena.

28:21.367 --> 28:24.954
And without introducing her
to your mother, who's a big fan.

28:25.538 --> 28:27.123
I have all her records.

28:28.541 --> 28:30.751
Invite her to Cali's first communion.

28:31.293 --> 28:32.878
Let her come and eat with us.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.256
I love you, Mommy.

<i>Maradona runs, cuts back</i>
<i>in the goal area, pass to Víctor</i>

29:26.515 --> 29:29.935
<i>and it's a goal for Barca.</i>
<i>Goal for Barcelona, Víctor.</i>

29:30.102 --> 29:35.024
<i>And Barcelona takes the lead</i>
<i>in this Copa del Rey final.</i>

29:35.941 --> 29:39.361
<i>Barcelona starts with Gerardo,</i>
<i>Gerardo makes a mistake,</i>

29:39.445 --> 29:42.114
<i>Santillana shoots, goal for Real Madrid.</i>

29:42.198 --> 29:46.827
<i>Terrible mistake by Gerardo</i>
<i>and Santillana.</i>

29:47.536 --> 29:50.289
<i>Diego Maradona groans,</i>
<i>but he immediately goes</i>

29:50.372 --> 29:55.753
<i>to console Gerardo about the mistake.</i>

29:56.045 --> 29:58.839
<i>The final allotted minute of the game,</i>

29:58.923 --> 30:01.634
<i>the final pass and it's a goal by Marcos.</i>

30:01.717 --> 30:05.846
<i>A header by Marcos, Barca scores again.</i>

30:05.930 --> 30:08.224
<i>Barca are the Copa del Rey champions.</i>

30:11.018 --> 30:15.231
<i>Núñez's tears, the Barcelona president</i>
<i>watching his team win this cup.</i>

30:15.731 --> 30:18.817
<i>Sánchez, the captain,</i>
<i>is receiving the trophy</i>

30:18.901 --> 30:21.904
<i>that gives FC Barcelona</i>
<i>the title of cup champion.</i>

30:23.697 --> 30:25.950
<i>And Maradona is celebrating.</i>

30:26.075 --> 30:29.078
<i>This is the first title he wins</i>
<i>with the Barcelona shirt.</i>

30:31.330 --> 30:34.500
<i>As I am not</i>
<i>Engaged or married or anything</i>

30:34.583 --> 30:38.754
<i>And you are not</i>
<i>Engaged or married or anything</i>

30:38.837 --> 30:41.340
<i>Why don't we have a little chat?</i>

30:41.423 --> 30:43.842
<i>So we don't feel so lonely</i>

30:43.926 --> 30:47.429
<i>I am</i>
<i>Free, single in a hurry and unlucky</i>

30:47.513 --> 30:51.225
<i>And you are</i>
<i>Free, single, graceful and alone</i>

30:51.350 --> 30:53.352
<i>Why don't we take a little walk?</i>

30:53.435 --> 30:56.105
<i>Under this beautiful sky</i>

30:56.188 --> 30:59.733
<i>I am looking for a partner and I offer</i>

30:59.817 --> 31:01.110
What do you offer?

31:01.193 --> 31:03.988
<i>I mean, I don't know if you'll want</i>

31:04.071 --> 31:05.406
Go, Diego!

31:05.489 --> 31:09.702
<i>Sharing the things in my life</i>

31:10.536 --> 31:13.247
<i>Together there will be no more loneliness</i>

31:13.330 --> 31:14.456
Diego.

31:15.291 --> 31:16.458
Diego!

31:16.542 --> 31:18.669
<i>Engaged or married or anything</i>

31:18.794 --> 31:22.506
<i>And you are not</i>
<i>Engaged or married or anything</i>

31:22.590 --> 31:24.925
<i>Why don't we have a little chat?</i>

31:25.009 --> 31:26.343
<i>So we don't feel...</i>

31:26.427 --> 31:29.597
It's Claudia. I said you weren't here,
but she heard you.

31:34.184 --> 31:35.019
Hi, baby.

31:35.102 --> 31:36.812
<i>-Hello, brujita.</i>
- How are you?

31:36.895 --> 31:39.648
<i>What's with all that noise?</i>

31:39.732 --> 31:41.442
I'm singing with the family.

31:41.525 --> 31:44.612
- Passing time before dinner.
<i>-That sounds fun.</i>

31:48.365 --> 31:51.619
<i>Well, Lorena, you were telling me</i>
<i>that you met Maradona</i>

31:51.702 --> 31:54.163
<i>when he was playing for Barcelona.</i>

31:54.246 --> 31:55.956
<i>He went to see you sing,</i>

31:56.081 --> 31:58.250
<i>and that's when you fell in love, right?</i>

31:58.792 --> 32:01.629
No, Dalmita, no news about Daddy.
He's still the same.

32:02.838 --> 32:04.715
I'm having lunch with Grandma.

32:07.593 --> 32:11.096
No, honey, why would I go to jail?
No, not at all.

32:11.639 --> 32:15.142
Turn off the TV, Dalmita.
I told you not to turn it on.

32:15.225 --> 32:17.311
Don't watch it. Turn it off.

32:17.394 --> 32:20.064
<i>It wasn't something formal. We just...</i>

32:20.147 --> 32:21.732
Go play with your sister.

32:22.900 --> 32:25.486
I love you, honey. Bye, baby girl, bye.

32:30.074 --> 32:33.494
I want to take them to the hospital
to see their father.

32:33.577 --> 32:36.205
They're imagining all sorts of things.

32:36.288 --> 32:38.040
I'd rather they just go.

32:38.916 --> 32:41.960
<i>I respect and admire her so much.</i>

32:42.044 --> 32:44.588
<i>We all admire Claudia.</i>
<i>We love her very much.</i>

32:44.672 --> 32:47.466
<i>But as a lover, how would you rate him?</i>

32:48.008 --> 32:50.886
- How long has that shit been on?
- No, just now.

32:51.929 --> 32:55.140
<i>Maradona, as a lover,</i>
<i>is he in charge of the play,</i>

32:55.224 --> 32:59.561
<i>or does he stay on the sidelines</i>
<i>and watch everyone else play</i>

32:59.645 --> 33:03.565
<i>and doesn't take part</i>
<i>and just joins in the celebration?</i>

33:03.649 --> 33:06.026
<i>What is Diego like as a lover?</i>

33:07.027 --> 33:10.322
I'm going to ask for the bill.
I've lost my appetite.

33:10.406 --> 33:12.741
They added sausage, no...

33:12.825 --> 33:16.036
Put it in a bun, Tota.
Make yourself a hot dog.

33:16.120 --> 33:18.080
No, I don't want anything.

33:18.163 --> 33:21.417
- My appetite is gone.
- Are you doing this because of me?

33:21.500 --> 33:23.794
Don't worry about me. I'm used to this.

33:23.877 --> 33:26.380
What is Mrs. Tota like?

33:26.463 --> 33:28.173
They say she's a great woman,

33:28.257 --> 33:30.592
but with girlfriends,
lovers in this case...

33:30.676 --> 33:35.806
No, I'm done with this.
How do you take this off?

33:36.724 --> 33:38.767
I'm out. You tricked me.

33:38.851 --> 33:40.853
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

33:40.936 --> 33:43.480
Do you know how many
of Maradona's lovers we have?

33:43.564 --> 33:47.234
Bring me the one wearing animal print.
Come, sit down, my dear.

33:47.317 --> 33:49.570
- I'm Wanda.
- Wanda, with the animal print.

33:49.653 --> 33:53.407
In just a few minutes,
we'll be talking to other lovers,

33:53.490 --> 33:56.952
many of Maradona's lovers
who will disclose everything.

33:57.369 --> 34:01.373
<i>We will be talking about Maradona</i>
<i>and his lovers...</i>

34:01.457 --> 34:02.916
Should I ask for the bill?

34:03.709 --> 34:07.129
Do you think I didn't know
Diego and Lorena were lovers?

34:07.212 --> 34:09.339
That you welcomed Lorena with open arms

34:09.423 --> 34:12.009
to your home in Spain
while I was in Buenos Aires?

34:12.092 --> 34:17.389
That was a long time ago, Claudia.
Diego was young.

34:19.933 --> 34:22.102
What about the mother of Diego's son?

34:22.561 --> 34:24.730
You welcomed her with open arms too,

34:24.813 --> 34:28.484
until her belly started showing,
and you all gave her the thumbs down.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.527
And how many more were there?

34:30.611 --> 34:32.696
Tell me. Thousands, right?

34:34.072 --> 34:36.575
I'm disgusted by what they say on TV too,

34:36.658 --> 34:39.203
but I'm more disgusted by what Diego does,

34:39.286 --> 34:43.081
because what Diego does, he does,
not anyone else, he does it!

35:03.685 --> 35:05.312
Can he hear us?

35:08.565 --> 35:09.691
I'm sure he can.

35:20.577 --> 35:22.454
<i>Sleep</i>

35:23.038 --> 35:27.417
<i>Sleep, little boy</i>

35:27.501 --> 35:31.797
<i>Your mom is in the fields</i>

35:31.922 --> 35:36.260
<i>She's going to bring quails for you</i>

35:36.343 --> 35:40.764
<i>She's going to bring many things for you</i>

35:40.848 --> 35:45.352
<i>She's going to bring pork for you</i>

35:45.477 --> 35:49.565
<i>She's going to bring many things for you</i>

35:58.198 --> 36:02.411
<i>Barcelona coming onto the field</i>
<i>to play against Athletic Bilbao.</i>

36:02.494 --> 36:03.912
<i>Menotti's facial expression.</i>

36:03.996 --> 36:05.747
<i>Barcelona is playing with Maradona.</i>

36:05.831 --> 36:10.544
<i>They can't take the ball from Maradona.</i>
<i>He tries to shoot to the middle. He fails.</i>

36:10.627 --> 36:12.379
<i>Schuster passes to Maradona.</i>

36:12.462 --> 36:15.632
<i>Another foul against Maradona.</i>
<i>He keeps the ball regardless.</i>

36:15.716 --> 36:19.553
<i>The ball is stuck to number 10's</i>
<i>left foot. Maradona and a cutback.</i>

36:19.636 --> 36:22.973
<i>Foul. Maradona. A pass from Maradona.</i>

36:23.056 --> 36:25.684
<i>It goes to Perico Alonso. Barca scores.</i>

36:25.767 --> 36:30.272
<i>Barca scores. Perico Alonso.</i>
<i>A magnificent pass from Diego Maradona.</i>

36:30.355 --> 36:32.900
<i>Barcelona beats Athletic Bilbao 1-0.</i>

36:32.983 --> 36:36.987
<i>Maradona in the goal area, attention,</i>
<i>Barca shows up and it's a goal.</i>

36:38.572 --> 36:41.617
<i>Ball for Maradona, Maradona and a clash.</i>

36:41.700 --> 36:44.202
<i>With Andoni Goikoetxea.</i>

36:44.286 --> 36:47.623
<i>This might be an injury</i>
<i>for Diego Armando Maradona.</i>

36:47.706 --> 36:51.376
<i>The impact from the Bilbao player.</i>

36:51.460 --> 36:55.088
<i>Menotti looks worried.</i>

36:56.465 --> 36:58.592
Hey, Diego.

36:58.675 --> 37:00.844
Get a stretcher over here!

37:00.928 --> 37:02.638
Diego, can I help you?

37:04.514 --> 37:06.016
Diego, it's okay.

37:08.936 --> 37:11.271
<i>Diego Maradona isn't getting up.</i>

37:12.189 --> 37:15.567
<i>Let's see what the referee decides.</i>

37:15.692 --> 37:18.403
<i>It's a yellow card for Andoni Goikoetxea,</i>

37:18.695 --> 37:21.239
<i>who isn't even expelled from the field.</i>

37:21.323 --> 37:25.577
<i>Meanwhile, Maradona</i>
<i>is writhing in pain on the ground</i>

37:25.661 --> 37:28.497
<i>and help is being requested</i>
<i>from the paramedics</i>

37:28.580 --> 37:31.249
<i>to carry the Argentine star off,</i>

37:31.333 --> 37:33.627
<i>whose face reveals excruciating pain.</i>

37:33.710 --> 37:38.215
<i>This may be a serious injury</i>
<i>for the Barcelona player,</i>

37:38.298 --> 37:43.053
<i>the star of the team, who is now</i>
<i>making his way to the changing room.</i>

37:51.186 --> 37:54.690
He broke my leg, man.
He did it on purpose.

37:54.773 --> 37:58.360
- Easy, Pelusa.
- It hurts so much.

37:58.443 --> 38:02.531
You've been on the ground for 20 minutes.
Where's the ambulance?

38:02.656 --> 38:05.867
- Why isn't the ambulance here?
- They did it on purpose.

39:11.391 --> 39:14.978
<i>The drama between President</i>
<i>Josep Lluís Núñez and Diego Maradona</i>

39:15.062 --> 39:18.440
<i>got a new chapter this week,</i>
<i>when the Barcelona star</i>

39:18.523 --> 39:21.443
<i>traveled to Argentina</i>
<i>to begin his rehabilitation there.</i>

39:22.903 --> 39:25.614
<i>Maradona ignored warnings</i>
<i>from the club's leaders,</i>

39:25.697 --> 39:28.867
<i>who wanted to have his injury</i>
<i>treated by the club's doctors.</i>

39:28.950 --> 39:30.535
They injured me.

39:30.660 --> 39:34.956
<i>The individual who has taken on</i>
<i>rehabilitating Diego in Argentina</i>

39:35.040 --> 39:39.503
<i>is one Dr. Rubén Oliva,</i>
<i>famous for his unorthodox methods.</i>

39:43.715 --> 39:47.385
The doctors at Barcelona say
that Diego should keep the cast on

39:47.469 --> 39:50.597
and not walk on it.
We're gonna do the exact opposite.

39:51.181 --> 39:54.392
A fracture like this can't be fixed
by immobilizing it,

39:54.476 --> 39:57.104
because the tissues will not regenerate.

39:57.187 --> 39:58.730
It's time to walk on it.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.149
The body has memory,

40:01.233 --> 40:03.652
and you'll be able to recover your talent.

40:03.735 --> 40:07.823
Okay, excuse me, Dieguito.
Come on, there you go.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.908
- Let's go, come on.
- Careful, Carlos.

40:09.991 --> 40:12.244
- Come on.
- Carlos, not like that!

40:12.327 --> 40:14.162
- Carlos.
- Be strong, Diego.

40:14.246 --> 40:15.872
The World Cup is coming up.

40:28.802 --> 40:31.054
Let's eat! It's ready!

40:37.978 --> 40:39.938
Let's eat, leave the ball alone.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.399
Hit me.

40:44.151 --> 40:45.402
I win.

41:21.229 --> 41:22.731
How are you, Mr. Francis?

41:23.315 --> 41:24.441
Do you remember me?

41:26.610 --> 41:27.777
Hey, Pelusa!

41:28.445 --> 41:30.197
What are you doing here?

41:31.114 --> 41:32.449
No!

41:32.991 --> 41:34.659
What are you doing here?

41:37.329 --> 41:40.874
Hey, kid, how's it going?

41:40.957 --> 41:43.460
Just hanging out. I got injured.

41:43.960 --> 41:46.129
I need you to teach me how to kick.

41:47.964 --> 41:52.135
Hit that asshole between the eyes,
so he remembers that this is a game.

41:59.684 --> 42:02.312
When you hit it, don't pull away so fast.

42:02.395 --> 42:04.105
The ball won't know what you want.

42:07.692 --> 42:09.986
I don't want to hear noise, Pelusa.

42:16.159 --> 42:17.869
Show me your shoe.

42:19.871 --> 42:22.749
Kid, your ankle's changed.
It's a different ankle.

42:22.832 --> 42:25.752
You have to bandage it differently.
Take it off.

42:32.550 --> 42:33.677
Try it like this.

42:35.804 --> 42:38.890
- Do you think this is going to work?
- God knows.

42:50.110 --> 42:51.945
That's it!

42:52.028 --> 42:54.239
You're going to be all right, kid!

42:55.323 --> 42:57.993
<i>The end of corruption!</i>

43:00.829 --> 43:03.623
<i>The end of Argentina's helplessness...</i>

43:03.707 --> 43:06.876
<i>Democracy is coming to the country!</i>

43:08.461 --> 43:10.964
Hey, come on! Turn off the TV.

43:11.047 --> 43:14.467
Stop being so miserable.
Come here, it's Diego's birthday.

43:14.634 --> 43:17.220
<i>It's basically about</i>

43:17.304 --> 43:20.765
<i>seeing if it's possible for us...</i>

43:23.101 --> 43:25.770
- Come on, Dad, come on.
- Honey!

43:32.569 --> 43:33.987
Your attention, please.

43:34.904 --> 43:36.948
Hey, I want to make a toast,

43:37.032 --> 43:39.117
to democracy and to Alfonsín.

43:39.701 --> 43:41.494
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

43:42.329 --> 43:45.707
And also to Argentina
qualifying for the World Cup

43:45.790 --> 43:47.792
and being world champions.

43:48.293 --> 43:51.129
<i>Argentina, Argentina!</i>

43:51.212 --> 43:53.673
<i>Argentina, Argentina!</i>

43:53.757 --> 43:56.176
<i>Argentina, Argentina!</i>

45:00.865 --> 45:01.991
Lorena, have you...

45:04.160 --> 45:06.037
been with other guys lately?

45:08.623 --> 45:10.458
Why are you asking me that, Diego?

45:11.167 --> 45:14.129
You're doing things in bed
that you didn't do before.

45:15.213 --> 45:16.631
Of course, I have.

45:17.048 --> 45:18.925
Are you saying I can't?

45:19.092 --> 45:20.760
We're not a couple.

45:20.844 --> 45:22.137
So, what are we?

45:22.220 --> 45:24.013
I don't know, you tell me.

45:24.222 --> 45:26.349
Every time the press asks you about me,

45:26.433 --> 45:28.351
you pretend to be offended.

45:28.435 --> 45:30.854
- I don't want to hurt Claudia.
- That's fine.

45:31.521 --> 45:34.315
Because Claudia is your girlfriend,
isn't she?

45:35.316 --> 45:36.734
Claudia is a good girl

45:36.985 --> 45:39.612
who is willing to follow you everywhere,

45:39.863 --> 45:41.531
to put up with your affairs.

45:42.490 --> 45:43.616
I'm not.

45:45.118 --> 45:47.745
You never asked me not to have affairs.

45:47.829 --> 45:49.414
And I never will.

45:50.331 --> 45:52.208
Because I want to have them too.

45:52.959 --> 45:54.919
I won't give up anything for you.

45:59.507 --> 46:01.634
I think it's best that we break this off.

46:04.637 --> 46:05.972
Are you leaving now?

46:28.077 --> 46:30.455
<i>We are at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.</i>

46:30.538 --> 46:33.666
<i>It's the '83-'84 Copa del Rey final,</i>

46:33.750 --> 46:36.085
<i>FC Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao.</i>

46:36.169 --> 46:39.255
<i>The Royal Family waves.</i>
<i>The game is about to begin.</i>

46:39.339 --> 46:42.592
<i>There's Barcelona's president,</i>
<i>the Bilbao supporters.</i>

46:45.803 --> 46:47.805
<i>The players are lined up.</i>

46:49.724 --> 46:51.684
I swear I didn't mean to hurt you.

46:51.768 --> 46:55.730
When I heard about your fracture,
I called you several times to apologize.

46:55.813 --> 46:57.565
Take your hand off me, idiot.

46:57.649 --> 47:01.277
You shouldn't be here.
You should be in a zoo, donkey.

47:01.361 --> 47:03.947
I'll make you eat grass.
You'll see, donkey.

47:04.614 --> 47:05.657
Let it go, man.

47:06.157 --> 47:08.493
<i>There's César Luis Menotti on the bench,</i>

47:08.576 --> 47:11.329
<i>the players posing for the press.</i>

47:12.747 --> 47:15.041
<i>The champions, Athletic Bilbao,</i>

47:15.124 --> 47:17.001
<i>and the game is about to start.</i>

47:18.253 --> 47:21.589
<i>First whistle. They're playing</i>
<i>for the Copa del Rey at Bernabeu.</i>

47:21.714 --> 47:23.341
<i>Maradona has the ball.</i>

47:24.509 --> 47:28.096
<i>There goes Maradona. Foul from Liceranzu.</i>

47:28.471 --> 47:31.891
<i>A pass to the goal area.</i>
<i>Endika and it's a goal for Bilbao.</i>

47:31.975 --> 47:35.436
<i>They take the lead,</i>
<i>Athletic Bilbao with Endika.</i>

47:35.520 --> 47:37.772
<i>Maradona, foul from Liceranzu.</i>

47:37.855 --> 47:40.108
<i>Liceranzu against Maradona.</i>

47:40.233 --> 47:43.361
<i>Another impact from Liceranzu</i>
<i>against Diego Maradona.</i>

47:43.444 --> 47:46.823
<i>The Argentine star tries to shoot,</i>
<i>he gets a foul.</i>

47:46.906 --> 47:49.742
<i>It's Maradona again.</i>
<i>Liceranzu is down, an impact.</i>

47:50.618 --> 47:53.746
<i>Barcelona can't get through,</i>
<i>another foul from Liceranzu.</i>

47:53.830 --> 47:56.708
<i>Schuster gets mad</i>
<i>and complains to the audience</i>

47:56.791 --> 47:58.960
<i>and expresses all of his anger.</i>

47:59.794 --> 48:02.714
<i>Barcelona is losing</i>
<i>in this Copa del Rey final.</i>

48:02.797 --> 48:05.216
<i>It's Maradona,</i>
<i>and he's down, another impact.</i>

48:05.341 --> 48:06.718
<i>It's Liceranzu again.</i>

48:06.801 --> 48:11.222
<i>Maradona, angry and upset,</i>
<i>confronts his rival.</i>

48:11.306 --> 48:14.684
<i>The referee splits them up,</i>
<i>and so ends the game.</i>

48:14.767 --> 48:18.271
<i>Athletic Bilbao is</i>
<i>the new Copa del Rey champion,</i>

48:18.354 --> 48:21.065
<i>and it ends with them coming to blows.</i>

48:21.149 --> 48:24.569
<i>Maradona, out of control,</i>
<i>maybe remembering</i>

48:24.652 --> 48:28.448
<i>that this was the team that forced him</i>
<i>off the field for several months.</i>

48:28.531 --> 48:30.992
<i>Andoni Goikoetxea is part of the team.</i>

48:31.451 --> 48:35.830
<i>This has become a boxing match</i>
<i>on the soccer field.</i>

48:35.913 --> 48:38.833
<i>They're trying to split up</i>
<i>Diego Armando Maradona</i>

48:38.916 --> 48:41.377
<i>and some of the injured ones.</i>

48:41.461 --> 48:45.256
<i>Athletic Bilbao crowned champions</i>
<i>in an embarrassing Copa del Rey final.</i>

48:49.844 --> 48:53.973
I want Maradona out of Barca,
out of Catalonia and out of Spain!

48:54.641 --> 48:57.435
Look, Jorge,
the club's board of directors,

48:58.227 --> 49:02.106
after quite a few hours of discussion,
has unanimously decided

49:02.190 --> 49:05.652
that Diego Armando Maradona's tenure
at Barcelona is over.

49:06.653 --> 49:08.863
We will make it official immediately,

49:08.946 --> 49:11.699
so that we can hear offers
from other clubs.

49:14.535 --> 49:18.498
- There's no way to rectify this situation?
- There's no turning back.

49:26.255 --> 49:31.135
Well, gentlemen, if that's all.

49:51.864 --> 49:53.074
Cheers, cheers.

49:56.703 --> 49:59.247
Oh, my God, they're crazy.

50:01.124 --> 50:03.584
What's up? Are you enjoying the sausages?

50:03.668 --> 50:06.212
Your girlfriend is beautiful,
congratulations.

50:06.295 --> 50:07.630
Hey, how are you?

50:08.047 --> 50:12.635
That looks so good.
The sausages are really good.

50:13.761 --> 50:16.472
Hello, how are you? All good?

50:16.556 --> 50:19.475
Waiter, over there.
Make sure no one's hungry.

50:19.559 --> 50:21.519
Hi, thanks for coming.

50:21.602 --> 50:23.396
Thanks for coming. Nice hair.

50:25.356 --> 50:27.734
What's up, Rengo? Is that how you dance?

50:27.817 --> 50:30.570
Be careful of Rengo,
because Rengo has a big one,

50:30.653 --> 50:33.364
and he's horny as hell. Excuse me.

50:33.448 --> 50:36.868
Come on, say a few words, Pelusa, come on.

50:36.951 --> 50:40.121
Everyone wants to hear you
say a few words.

50:40.246 --> 50:44.792
Speech, speech, speech, speech!

50:45.877 --> 50:49.380
Well, friends, I invited you here today...

50:51.299 --> 50:53.676
to blow the roof off this place!

50:55.595 --> 50:58.181
That's what we say
when we throw a great party,

50:58.264 --> 51:01.976
and today we have to celebrate because...

51:03.102 --> 51:05.229
I was kicked off the Barcelona team.

51:08.483 --> 51:11.277
It was a shitty time in my life, you know?

51:12.320 --> 51:14.947
I had a bad time.
They gave me a hard time.

51:15.031 --> 51:18.159
So everything from here on out
will be so much better.

51:19.327 --> 51:24.207
I want to thank my friends,
my lifelong friends, who came with me.

51:24.540 --> 51:26.793
I wouldn't be here without them.

51:27.418 --> 51:29.003
We love you, Pelusa!

51:29.253 --> 51:32.256
And especially
I want to thank Claudia, who...

51:32.340 --> 51:35.510
You are my love. I love you.
You are the love of my life.

51:35.593 --> 51:38.179
But I don't want to bore you,
so enjoy and dance.

51:43.351 --> 51:45.186
You're beautiful. I love you.

51:45.269 --> 51:46.145
- Really?
- Yes.

51:49.524 --> 51:50.775
Diego, stop.

51:51.150 --> 51:52.735
- I need to pee.
- Yeah?

51:52.819 --> 51:54.987
Yes, I'm about to burst.

51:58.991 --> 52:00.868
Let's celebrate.

52:00.952 --> 52:04.080
You two, what are you doing?
Take it easy, huh? Excuse me.

52:04.705 --> 52:06.582
Hello, my dear.

52:08.918 --> 52:10.336
Don't go too far.

52:11.170 --> 52:12.088
Okay.

52:13.381 --> 52:16.133
Excuse me. Who's next for the bathroom?

52:16.342 --> 52:17.802
I'll cut in, it's my house,

52:17.885 --> 52:20.096
I'm not going to wait, guys, thanks.

52:20.972 --> 52:22.098
Excuse me.

52:24.517 --> 52:29.105
- I didn't know you were here.
- It's all right, don't worry.

52:31.148 --> 52:34.277
Hey, tell me, is it true what they say?

52:35.403 --> 52:38.656
If you do it once,
you become a drug addict forever?

52:39.198 --> 52:41.909
If that were the case,
half the population of Spain

52:41.993 --> 52:44.579
would be in rehab by now.

52:47.206 --> 52:49.750
- Could I try some?
- Sure.

52:52.044 --> 52:54.589
Really? Is this your first time?

52:57.008 --> 52:58.092
Well.

52:59.594 --> 53:02.597
Press on one side
and inhale with the other.

53:02.680 --> 53:04.599
Don't blow out, or you'll waste it.

53:21.407 --> 53:22.867
It stings a little, huh?

53:31.375 --> 53:35.296
At Barcelona, Diego Maradona
played 58 games and scored 38 goals.

53:35.379 --> 53:38.341
With him the club won the Copa del Rey,

53:38.424 --> 53:41.844
the Copa de la Liga and Spain's Supercopa.

53:43.346 --> 53:46.849
The final against Athletic Bilbao
that ended in a battlefield

53:46.933 --> 53:48.893
hurried his departure from the club.

53:50.311 --> 53:53.356
Josep Núñez was in charge
of the club for 22 years.

53:53.439 --> 53:56.901
In 2011, he was accused
and sentenced to 6 years in prison

53:56.984 --> 53:58.569
for bribery and tax evasion.

53:59.987 --> 54:01.781
After injuring Maradona,

54:01.864 --> 54:05.159
Goikoetxea earned the nickname,
"The Butcher of Bilbao."

54:05.242 --> 54:08.412
He still keeps the shoes
he wore during that game.

54:09.455 --> 54:12.667
Maradona, what does
César Menotti's Barcelona have

54:12.750 --> 54:14.126
that Lattek's didn't?

54:14.210 --> 54:17.713
There are other ways to see the future.

54:17.797 --> 54:20.841
We all want to earn our place
because we know

54:20.925 --> 54:24.804
we are in a hurry because
of the great players we have

54:25.388 --> 54:28.349
off the field and that makes us

54:28.724 --> 54:31.644
want to show Menotti that we can deliver.

54:44.490 --> 54:47.368
<i>I'm sad because I'd never been injured</i>

54:48.619 --> 54:51.163
in the six years
before I came to Barcelona,

54:51.247 --> 54:53.374
playing in the first division.

54:53.457 --> 54:56.002
I'd never been injured, never been sick,

54:56.544 --> 55:00.006
and I came to Barcelona
with a great desire

55:00.089 --> 55:03.259
to win many championships,

55:03.342 --> 55:05.136
and I didn't even play a full one.

55:13.102 --> 55:15.730
I feel so proud to have been chosen,

55:16.480 --> 55:19.692
because, let's be clear,
I didn't teach Diego, he was a genius,

55:19.817 --> 55:22.319
I took care of him
so that he could succeed.

55:32.747 --> 55:34.915
What does this victory mean to you?

55:34.999 --> 55:38.002
Personally, it means a lot,

55:38.085 --> 55:41.630
because we weren't aiming for it.

55:41.714 --> 55:44.133
We just got lucky.

55:44.216 --> 55:47.261
Today, on the other hand,
we made an unlucky mistake

55:47.344 --> 55:49.889
and Madrid drew without deserving it,

55:49.972 --> 55:52.641
but in the end, I think that we did it,

55:52.725 --> 55:55.853
and, thank God, we won the Copa del Rey.

56:03.778 --> 56:05.821
I want to say to the people of Barcelona

56:05.905 --> 56:07.531
that not all Argentines are bad.

56:07.907 --> 56:09.992
We don't tear anybody down

56:10.076 --> 56:11.744
and we know how to live.

56:11.827 --> 56:14.747
We are not accountable

56:14.830 --> 56:17.416
for those who came here to harm Barcelona,

56:17.500 --> 56:21.921
but we're being made to pay for it.

56:22.254 --> 56:25.007
A lot happened, I made mistakes,

56:25.091 --> 56:30.012
but I was always upfront,
I never hid anything.
