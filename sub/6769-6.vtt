WEBVTT

00:04.170 --> 00:06.631
{\an1}David, it's
a modeling job.

00:06.715 --> 00:07.549
Yeah?

00:07.632 --> 00:09.759
What kind of modeling?

00:09.843 --> 00:13.388
Uh, it's a print ad
for some magazine,

00:13.471 --> 00:15.265
some photographer.

00:15.348 --> 00:17.934
Eric said it paid well.

00:19.853 --> 00:23.606
{\an3}Have you forgotten
the party he took us to?

00:23.690 --> 00:26.109
{\an3}Sophie, the guy is
a bottom-feeder.

00:26.192 --> 00:28.611
Well, I need the money.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.613
{\an1}And compared to
the heavy breathers

00:30.697 --> 00:33.450
{\an1}that have called in
response to my billboard,

00:33.533 --> 00:36.077
Eric is a prince.

00:36.161 --> 00:38.496
{\an3}You know what?
You're beautiful...

00:38.580 --> 00:40.498
and you're smart...
and you're talented.

00:40.582 --> 00:44.502
{\an3}Of all the people I've seen
come to this town to make it,

00:44.586 --> 00:47.630
{\an3}you're the one
with the best shot.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.632
You're sweet.

00:49.716 --> 00:52.302
No, I'm honest.

00:52.385 --> 00:56.139
{\an3}(sighs): Don't waste
yourself on this.

00:56.222 --> 00:58.475
Oh, David, David, David, listen,
you got to come see this.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.310
{\an5}See what?
Well, it's too
good to say,

01:00.393 --> 01:01.728
{\an3}so you're gonna have
to come with me.

01:01.811 --> 01:03.730
{\an6}Nice to see you, too.
Yeah, whatever.
Anyways, it's in Bel Air,

01:03.813 --> 01:04.980
it's about ten minutes
from here, I'll drive.

01:05.063 --> 01:06.691
{\an1}Val, we're right in the middle
of something here.

01:06.775 --> 01:07.984
Can't this wait?

01:08.067 --> 01:09.819
{\an3}By the way, there's
some guy in your car.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.404
What?

01:14.407 --> 01:17.660
Excuse me, hey, excuse me.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.496
{\an1}Hi. Um, what
are you doing?

01:19.579 --> 01:20.663
I'm repossessing your car.

01:20.747 --> 01:21.664
You can't do that.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.666
{\an1}Uh-huh.
No, no, you...

01:23.750 --> 01:24.626
you really can't. It...

01:24.709 --> 01:25.668
Wait, wait, um,

01:25.752 --> 01:26.628
{\an1}excuse me?

01:26.711 --> 01:28.338
Wait, wait. No.

01:28.421 --> 01:29.547
You can't do that.

01:29.631 --> 01:30.673
See, I'm an actress,

01:30.757 --> 01:32.008
{\an1}and I have auditions,
you know,

01:32.091 --> 01:33.635
all over town, and...

01:33.718 --> 01:36.513
if you take my car-- no!

01:40.642 --> 01:42.602
Where you going?

01:42.685 --> 01:44.687
To make some money.

01:47.774 --> 01:51.528
{\an1}Yes, we did it! And it's all
thanks to you, my friend.

01:51.611 --> 01:53.655
{\an3}Well, thank the judge--
it wasn't my ruling.

01:53.738 --> 01:55.365
{\an1}Hey.

01:59.452 --> 02:00.662
What happened?

02:00.745 --> 02:03.081
{\an1}Unsupervised visits
certain weekday afternoons

02:03.164 --> 02:04.499
and every other weekend.

02:04.582 --> 02:06.584
Plus, I'm not allowed
to leave the county.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.711
{\an3}So, Lenny got exactly
what he wanted.

02:08.794 --> 02:12.340
{\an1}Full rights to my daughter,
and full access to me.

02:12.423 --> 02:13.591
I told you, sweetie--

02:13.675 --> 02:15.718
we'll be seeing
each other all the time.

02:15.802 --> 02:19.222
She'll be ready at 3:00.

02:19.305 --> 02:22.559
{\an1}Well, you can come
with us if you want.

02:22.642 --> 02:25.854
{\an1}I got a big
afternoon planned.

02:25.937 --> 02:27.939
{\an3}Congratulations,
Counselor.

02:28.022 --> 02:30.775
{\an3}You are a credit
to your profession.

Well, Val, you've always wanted
to live large.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.054
Yeah, I did.

04:23.137 --> 04:25.682
{\an3}And it's for free,
before it's too late.

04:25.765 --> 04:26.891
Too late for what?

04:26.975 --> 04:27.684
This house is perfect

04:27.767 --> 04:29.852
{\an3}for the killer party
I'm gonna throw.

04:29.936 --> 04:32.522
Val, you're gonna throw a party
in someone else's house?

04:32.605 --> 04:33.815
Is that okay?

04:33.898 --> 04:35.441
Absolutely not-- but
see, there's this guy

04:35.525 --> 04:38.027
{\an3}who looks for house-sitters,
and for 50% of the door...

04:38.111 --> 04:39.362
The door?
(laughs)

04:39.445 --> 04:41.197
{\an1}You're gonna charge
people to get in here?

04:41.281 --> 04:43.032
{\an3}He does the invitations
and the food

04:43.116 --> 04:44.534
{\an3}and-- oh, Blue
Navel's in town.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.286
{\an3}I was thinking about
having them play.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.870
At your party?

04:47.954 --> 04:50.248
The one... you're not
supposed to be having.

04:50.331 --> 04:53.459
{\an3}Hmm. Doesn't it
sound great. Yes!

04:55.086 --> 04:57.005
You looking at me?

04:57.088 --> 05:00.174
{\an1}You looking at me?
(laughs)

05:00.258 --> 05:02.552
I think she likes me.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.053
(fusses)

05:04.137 --> 05:05.513
What's wrong?

05:05.596 --> 05:08.516
(crying):
I've never been away from her.

05:08.599 --> 05:12.228
{\an3}And I know it's only for
the afternoon, but...

05:12.311 --> 05:14.313
what if she needs me?

05:15.565 --> 05:17.567
(knocking)

05:17.650 --> 05:19.610
I'll get it.

05:23.322 --> 05:25.408
{\an3}Allison will be ready
in a few minutes.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.618
{\an1}Yeah, thanks
for the bulletin.

05:27.702 --> 05:30.079
Hey... sweet thing.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.081
{\an1}Hey, sweet thing,
Daddy's here.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.082
There's diapers

05:33.166 --> 05:37.003
and wipes, a change of clothes,
and baby food.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.048
And a bottle and formula.

05:40.131 --> 05:42.550
We're going to Hollywood Park.

05:42.633 --> 05:43.926
The racetrack?

05:44.010 --> 05:47.096
They have a playground.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.306
(scoffs)

05:48.389 --> 05:50.600
You want to come?

05:50.683 --> 05:52.935
Have her home by 6:00.

05:54.395 --> 05:56.606
{\an3}What? You used to
like the track.

05:56.689 --> 05:57.774
(door slams)

05:57.857 --> 05:59.275
(crying)

05:59.358 --> 06:01.944
Lenny, can you handle this?

06:02.028 --> 06:03.404
(crying continues)

06:03.488 --> 06:04.614
Yeah.

06:04.697 --> 06:05.615
Because if you can't...

06:05.698 --> 06:07.492
(shouting):
I said yes!

06:10.244 --> 06:11.871
(continues crying)

06:17.752 --> 06:18.920
STEVE:
Features?

06:19.003 --> 06:21.839
{\an6}(sighs):
Well, we've got an article
that Brandon wrote about

06:21.923 --> 06:23.257
{\an6}(groans)
shoreline
development.

06:23.341 --> 06:25.301
Okay, what about departments?

06:25.384 --> 06:27.178
{\an3}Brandon wrote two
killer music reviews

06:27.261 --> 06:29.639
{\an3}(groans)
and a top-ten list

06:29.722 --> 06:31.766
about where to find the
best hamburger in town.

06:31.849 --> 06:33.434
Editorials?

06:33.518 --> 06:35.269
Brandon wrote one,
it's about the drug scene

06:35.353 --> 06:36.813
and the proposed
Saturday night curfew.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.689
Do we have anything
that Brandon didn't write?

06:38.773 --> 06:40.483
I mean, feel free to humor me.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.610
We've got about
an issue's worth of articles,

06:42.693 --> 06:44.112
and then we're on our own.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.863
(grunts in mock pain)

06:45.947 --> 06:47.156
We can do this.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.325
Oh, yeah, sure we can.

06:49.408 --> 06:50.827
{\an1}All we have
to do is think

06:50.910 --> 06:53.162
of ten articles, a week,
report them, write them,

06:53.246 --> 06:54.997
{\an3}edit them... (groans)
Right. Well, uh,

06:55.081 --> 06:57.333
12 articles, usually.

06:57.416 --> 06:58.543
Freelancers.

06:58.626 --> 07:00.837
They're good for about
three articles, max,

07:00.920 --> 07:03.339
{\an3}and there-there's...
fact-checking,

07:03.422 --> 07:06.175
doing pictures,
writing captions, headlines,

07:06.259 --> 07:07.844
{\an3}layouts...
(groans)

07:07.927 --> 07:09.345
We're dead, we're dead,
we're dead!

07:09.428 --> 07:10.763
No, we're not.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.431
We are not dead.

07:12.515 --> 07:13.724
I believe in you.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.644
You do?

07:16.727 --> 07:18.187
Of course.

07:20.064 --> 07:20.857
I mean...

07:21.774 --> 07:23.317
...sure.

07:25.153 --> 07:25.695
Sort of.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.496
Beautiful, Soph, just beautiful.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.331
Now, untie the top.

07:37.415 --> 07:38.374
(laughs):
Very funny.

07:38.457 --> 07:39.584
Come on.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.379
Oh.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.926
Now all the way.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.681
For a lipstick ad,
I don't think so.

07:53.764 --> 07:55.266
Forget lipstick.

07:55.349 --> 07:58.019
You want to be an actress,
a professional model,

07:58.102 --> 07:59.729
{\an3}you'll have to take
off your clothes,

07:59.812 --> 08:01.731
{\an6}just like
everybody else.
Not this way, I don't.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.902
{\an1}Fine. Just hand over the check
we cut, pay our expenses

08:05.985 --> 08:08.404
for the last day,
and we'll call it a wrap.

08:08.487 --> 08:10.740
What expenses?
For our time.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.617
We had a contract, remember?

08:12.700 --> 08:14.368
Unless, of course,

08:14.452 --> 08:16.412
you want to reconsider.

08:18.706 --> 08:20.625
No, suit yourself.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.252
I guarantee you will not work
in this town again

08:23.336 --> 08:25.755
{\an1}with that
prima donna attitude.

08:50.863 --> 08:53.950
{\an3}Okay, now,
turn to me.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.494
{\an3}Beautiful.
Beautiful, Soph.

08:57.536 --> 08:59.497
Ah, it's perfect.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.671
Hey, you.

09:06.754 --> 09:07.838
How was court?

09:07.922 --> 09:09.257
I won.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.466
Oh.

09:10.549 --> 09:11.592
Thought you understood.

09:11.676 --> 09:14.637
No, I... I do.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.013
It's just hard.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.015
Lenny's a bad guy.
Yeah,

09:18.099 --> 09:19.642
{\an1}and he treated Leah
terribly, I know.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.811
{\an1}But Allison needs her father,
and that's what...

09:21.894 --> 09:23.688
So you've said.

09:23.771 --> 09:26.148
I have work... I got to do.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.651
I read <i> A Civil Action.</i>

09:28.734 --> 09:30.695
Thanks for giving it to me.

09:30.778 --> 09:32.613
Did you like it?

09:32.697 --> 09:34.615
{\an3}Are you kidding?
I loved it.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.284
I-I thought
we could talk about it

09:36.367 --> 09:37.660
some more, maybe
over dinner or something?

09:37.743 --> 09:42.164
You, uh, haven't said anything
about Noah lately.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.334
I haven't seen him.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.461
But you're still seeing
each other.

09:47.545 --> 09:50.798
(laughs):
I don't know; it's confusing.

09:50.881 --> 09:53.592
But I do know
I could use a friend.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.807
{\an1}NAT: Hey.
Hey.

09:59.890 --> 10:01.350
Hey, Nat.
Two coffees, please.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.019
Sure. Read that.

10:03.102 --> 10:04.020
Oh.
Ah.

10:04.103 --> 10:06.480
{\an1}"Martians Land In
Beverly Hills."

10:06.564 --> 10:07.898
Well, look at the bright side--

10:07.982 --> 10:09.692
we could be publishing
garbage like that.

10:09.775 --> 10:12.403
"Hollywood starlet seen running
naked down Wilshire Boulevard."

10:12.486 --> 10:14.447
They say they have
exclusive photos.

10:14.530 --> 10:16.866
{\an3}Gee, Steve, I wonder
if they really do.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.534
People read this stuff.

10:18.617 --> 10:21.162
{\an3}Yeah, they're the people that
think Elvis really lives.

10:21.245 --> 10:23.164
{\an3}Now, can we please
talk about <i> The Beat?</i>

10:23.247 --> 10:24.206
Yeah, sure.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.668
{\an3}Okay. So, what
are we gonna do?

10:27.752 --> 10:29.754
{\an1}Steve?
It's just that they

10:29.837 --> 10:31.547
churn this stuff out,
and we can't even think

10:31.630 --> 10:33.049
{\an3}of a single issue.
Well, our job is

10:33.132 --> 10:35.259
much harder-- it's not
like we can make it up.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.677
What did you say?

10:36.761 --> 10:37.720
Nothing.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.263
I didn't say anything.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.307
And whatever you're thinking,
don't think it.

10:41.390 --> 10:43.351
I'm pretty good
at making things up.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.728
Steve, we have something
really great here.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.730
We have something
that we can be proud of.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.815
In fact, it's one of
the things I do best.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.902
(chuckles):
Yes.

10:52.985 --> 10:55.404
{\an1}Okay, guys, listen,
we're at capacity inside.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.615
{\an1}Please be patient--
as soon as some people leave,

10:57.698 --> 10:59.700
{\an1}I'll take some more
of you in.

10:59.784 --> 11:00.743
How's everybody
doing tonight?

11:00.826 --> 11:02.036
(others shout, cheer)

11:02.119 --> 11:03.704
Is this the place
to be, or what?

11:03.788 --> 11:05.706
OTHERS:
Yeah!

11:05.790 --> 11:06.874
I saw your truck tonight, man.

11:06.957 --> 11:08.250
You got it worked.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.418
What's up with that?

11:09.502 --> 11:10.586
{\an1}(chuckles)
You like that, huh?

11:10.669 --> 11:11.962
Yeah.
We do a little racing

11:12.046 --> 11:13.381
up on Sepulveda, man.

11:13.464 --> 11:14.757
{\an1}Kind of helps
to psych out the other guy.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.133
You gotta check it out.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.344
All right, all right.

11:24.683 --> 11:26.310
The fact that it's Noah's club

11:26.394 --> 11:27.603
{\an1}has nothing to do
with why we're here?

11:27.686 --> 11:29.772
{\an3}No. Other than the fact
we can cut in line.

11:29.855 --> 11:31.107
And I like the band.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.441
{\an4}NOAH:
See Donna over there
with that guy?

11:32.525 --> 11:33.609
Yeah.

11:33.692 --> 11:35.611
{\an3}Whatever you do,
don't let them in.

11:42.326 --> 11:43.452
This is completely illegal.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.787
You should know that.

11:44.870 --> 11:45.788
We do.

11:45.871 --> 11:48.457
Child stealing?

11:48.541 --> 11:49.625
That's what they call it

11:49.708 --> 11:51.794
{\an3}when a parent breaks
a custody arrangement.

11:51.877 --> 11:54.839
And it is a felony.

11:57.508 --> 12:01.762
If I don't get away from Lenny,
he'll hurt me and my baby.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.806
Has he threatened you?
And beaten me.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.808
{\an3}Repeatedly.
Have you reported him?

12:05.891 --> 12:07.101
It never got filed.

12:07.184 --> 12:09.645
Now he has joint custody.

12:09.728 --> 12:10.771
Legally, I'm trapped.

12:10.855 --> 12:11.605
Hmm.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.190
{\an1}I got your name
from one of the nurses

12:13.274 --> 12:14.442
at the Wyatt Clinic.

12:14.525 --> 12:17.486
She said that you've helped
other battered women move away.

12:17.570 --> 12:18.696
{\an3}Disappear.

12:18.779 --> 12:19.822
{\an3}New home.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.657
New identity.

12:21.740 --> 12:24.076
You'd be completely cut off
from your current life.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.744
I have no life.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.538
Will you help us?

12:27.621 --> 12:30.458
I'm under investigation
by the D.A.'s office

12:30.541 --> 12:31.750
for the women that I've helped.

12:31.834 --> 12:32.668
So, no.

12:32.751 --> 12:34.170
{\an3}I can't.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.921
But I can guide you.

12:36.005 --> 12:36.839
How?

12:36.922 --> 12:38.716
I can tell you what you need--

12:38.799 --> 12:41.677
documents, identification--
but you've got to go out

12:41.760 --> 12:43.804
and get them.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.473
{\an3}Hey.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.266
You sure you're up for this?

12:47.349 --> 12:49.560
{\an3}'Cause your friend here is
going to need a lot of help.

12:49.643 --> 12:51.228
And aiding and abetting?

12:51.312 --> 12:53.898
It's a serious charge.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.949
Where do we begin?

13:13.667 --> 13:16.545
It's got to be perfect.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.005
How about this?

13:18.088 --> 13:19.632
No, nothing hideous.

13:21.759 --> 13:22.927
(sighs)

13:23.010 --> 13:24.887
Well, it would help if I knew
why you were throwing a party.

13:24.970 --> 13:29.016
Okay, think 1999.
Think end of the world.

13:29.099 --> 13:32.394
Okay.

13:32.478 --> 13:35.105
Ooh. This?

13:35.189 --> 13:37.233
Yeah! That's not dreadful.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.193
Great. Oh.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.324
Hmm.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.660
Hey.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.087
{\an1}(sighs)
You seen Matt?

13:58.170 --> 13:59.922
Try his office.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.299
{\an1}My first AA meeting's
the day after tomorrow.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.593
{\an1}The court sent Matt
all the details

14:04.677 --> 14:06.220
on, you know, the time,
place, stuff like that.

14:06.303 --> 14:09.431
That's good.
Um, it's upstairs on the left.

14:09.515 --> 14:10.933
He's not there.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.768
Thought maybe you'd know
where he is.

14:12.851 --> 14:14.895
I don't.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.360
Are you dating this guy?

14:23.320 --> 14:24.154
What?

14:24.238 --> 14:25.489
VALERIE:
You heard the man.

14:25.573 --> 14:26.740
You stay out of this.

14:26.824 --> 14:28.242
Are you?

14:28.325 --> 14:30.077
Since you didn't allow us
into the club last night,

14:30.160 --> 14:30.995
it's really none
of your business.

14:31.078 --> 14:34.123
Good line. Used it
a couple times myself.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.457
Oh, my God. That's it.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.459
Out! Out! Wait.

14:37.543 --> 14:38.127
(sighs)

14:38.210 --> 14:39.628
Here's directions to the party.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.006
Bring a date if you want.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.516
So, AA, huh?
That's tough.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.310
On alcoholics.

14:54.393 --> 14:55.769
{\an1}So you're just
a recreational drunk driver?

14:55.853 --> 14:59.106
{\an3}Look, I've got two days till
my court-appointed detox.

14:59.189 --> 15:00.691
{\an3}If you only had two days,
what would you do?

15:00.774 --> 15:04.153
Uh, I'd do something
incredibly reckless.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.613
I'd throw an illegal rave. You?

15:05.696 --> 15:07.197
{\an3}(chuckles)

15:07.281 --> 15:09.783
I don't know. The bouncer told
me about some race on Sepulveda.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.160
Sound reckless to you?

15:11.243 --> 15:12.328
Yeah. You need a partner?

15:12.411 --> 15:14.455
Yep. A fast car.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.707
Hmm.

15:21.462 --> 15:23.464
{\an1}Oh, man.
This is like...

15:23.547 --> 15:25.507
12 CDs.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.635
{\an3}Yeah, a little variety
for your show.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.511
{\an1}Thank you.
I love them.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.513
{\an1}Mwa!

15:31.597 --> 15:34.141
Well, it's, um, for the advice.

15:34.224 --> 15:35.059
About the modeling job.

15:35.142 --> 15:37.811
I wish I'd taken it.

15:37.895 --> 15:38.687
You didn't?

15:38.771 --> 15:42.149
No. That many CDs
don't come cheap.

15:42.232 --> 15:43.067
Unlike me.

15:43.150 --> 15:45.527
Stop, okay?

15:45.611 --> 15:46.904
You made a mistake.

15:46.987 --> 15:49.281
Yeah, one of many.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.784
You know, one call to Nat,
and you could, uh...

15:51.867 --> 15:53.243
start that waitressing job.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.538
Nothing like dating a man
with connections.

15:56.622 --> 15:57.915
Well,
it will cover your expenses

15:57.998 --> 15:59.375
until you get your big break.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.170
So, you want me to call?

16:10.094 --> 16:11.553
Tabloids are a joke, Steve.

16:11.637 --> 16:12.846
An embarrassment.

16:12.930 --> 16:15.182
Mm. A profitable embarrassment.

16:15.265 --> 16:18.477
{\an3}What about journalistic
integrity, huh?

16:18.560 --> 16:21.230
{\an3}What about writing
serious stories?

16:21.313 --> 16:24.024
{\an1}What about staying
in business?

16:24.108 --> 16:25.859
Okay. One question.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.403
What would Brandon think?

16:27.486 --> 16:29.196
I don't know.
Let's ask him.

16:29.279 --> 16:31.532
Brandon? Brandon?

16:31.615 --> 16:33.742
{\an1}Oh, that's right, Janet,
he doesn't work here anymore.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.411
Mm-hmm. That's really cute.

16:35.494 --> 16:38.163
{\an3}You know what? I want
no part of this.

16:38.247 --> 16:41.458
{\an1}The <i> Hollywood Eye.</i>
The <i> National Whisperer.</i>

16:41.542 --> 16:43.419
These papers make tons of money.

16:43.502 --> 16:44.878
And the beautiful part
about it is,

16:44.962 --> 16:46.755
they do it by running stories
that we can write.

16:46.839 --> 16:47.965
You and I.

16:48.048 --> 16:50.217
Can write? Yes.
Will write? Never.

16:50.300 --> 16:51.719
You'll be a reporter.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.095
A columnist.

16:53.178 --> 16:54.805
A bureau chief. What do you say?

16:54.888 --> 16:57.766
So long, Steve.
Best of luck to you.

16:57.850 --> 16:58.934
Wait, wait.

16:59.017 --> 17:00.102
Did I mention the benefits?

17:00.185 --> 17:01.979
{\an1}Health, pension,
vacation days.

17:02.062 --> 17:03.731
Pay raise.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.232
Huge pay raise.

17:05.315 --> 17:08.277
(laughing)

17:08.359 --> 17:10.154
I already got our first scoop.

17:10.237 --> 17:11.821
It's the Tower Town Hotel.

17:11.905 --> 17:13.323
It's haunted.

17:13.406 --> 17:15.075
(laughs creepily)

17:16.993 --> 17:18.369
(knocking)

17:20.705 --> 17:22.040
{\an3}Matt. Hi.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.166
Hi.

17:23.250 --> 17:26.252
Um, what's up?

17:26.336 --> 17:28.338
Uh...

17:29.214 --> 17:30.632
Nothing. I...

17:30.716 --> 17:32.176
{\an3}I was just out of
the office all day.

17:32.259 --> 17:34.136
{\an3}I thought I'd stop by,
see if you want to, um...

17:34.219 --> 17:35.220
{\an3}I don't know,
grab some dinner.

17:35.304 --> 17:39.266
{\an1}Oh. Really, that's really
nice of you, but I-I can't.

17:39.349 --> 17:41.268
{\an1}I already made plans.
Work plans.

17:41.351 --> 17:42.811
I have work to do.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.021
Am I coming at a bad time?

17:44.104 --> 17:45.647
No. No. Not at all.

17:45.731 --> 17:46.815
Is this about

17:46.899 --> 17:48.108
{\an3}what Noah did
last night, or...

17:48.192 --> 17:49.651
{\an3}did you just have
way too much coffee?

17:49.735 --> 17:51.320
Coffee, yeah, definitely.
Way too much.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.988
Tall cap,
double cap, mocha cap...

17:53.071 --> 17:55.282
(sighs)
You get the idea.

17:55.365 --> 17:57.201
Yeah, I'm beginning to.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.119
Maybe some other time?

17:59.203 --> 18:01.663
Yeah, sure. Sure.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.791
{\an3}Some other time.
Great.

18:06.126 --> 18:08.170
(sighs)

18:21.225 --> 18:22.810
{\an3}That hurt. You
should know that.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.978
{\an1}I know,
but he's Lenny's lawyer.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.022
He's a decent guy.

18:27.105 --> 18:29.233
{\an1}Who would do anything he can
to keep Leah from leaving.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.366
{\an1}I have to get them
out of town.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.076
(baby cries softly)

18:39.159 --> 18:41.203
{\an3}I hope you know
what you're doing.

18:48.085 --> 18:49.545
{\an3}Whoa.

18:49.628 --> 18:50.587
That was close.

18:50.671 --> 18:53.382
Hey.
Uh, mega burger with cheese.

18:53.465 --> 18:54.883
I haven't ordered yet.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.093
{\an3}Oh.

18:56.176 --> 18:58.053
I would like a cup of coffee.

18:58.136 --> 19:00.180
Right. Sorry.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.227
{\an1}Thank you.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.103
Okay.

19:06.186 --> 19:07.563
Who ordered this?

19:07.646 --> 19:09.731
They left.
They got tired of waiting.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.900
Oh. Oh, well.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.235
Feel like a mega burger?

19:13.318 --> 19:15.195
(chuckles)
Do I have to pay for it?

19:16.655 --> 19:17.865
{\an3}Beck, I'm sorry.
You know...

19:17.948 --> 19:20.701
Nah.

19:20.784 --> 19:22.244
But you'd better leave me
a big tip.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.413
So...

19:24.496 --> 19:26.415
Uh, Sophie,
what do you really do?

19:26.498 --> 19:28.417
{\an1}When you're not
doing this, I mean.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.085
I'm an astrophysicist.

19:30.168 --> 19:32.087
{\an3}You?

19:32.170 --> 19:33.130
Heir apparent.

19:33.213 --> 19:35.674
Mm. Right.
Who wants a free burger.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.468
Don't forget the tip.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.055
{\an1}Hey, Nat.

19:42.139 --> 19:43.432
Congratulations.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.893
{\an3}She's the worst waitress
I've ever seen.

19:47.352 --> 19:48.770
Hey.
Hi.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.939
{\an1}Nat says
you're doing a great job.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.941
Oh, well, then,
Nat's a moron.

19:53.025 --> 19:57.112
{\an3}I've made $16 in tips
in three hours.

19:57.195 --> 19:58.947
I think that's less
than minimum wage.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.407
I got you an audition.

20:00.490 --> 20:02.618
{\an3}To be what? The cocktail
waitress next door?

20:02.701 --> 20:03.911
Pass.
No.

20:03.994 --> 20:07.956
To meet with an independent film
director I did some jingles for.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.459
{\an3}Oh, okay.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.169
Um, I'm a jerk.

20:12.252 --> 20:13.295
{\an3}Thank you.

20:13.378 --> 20:15.631
Come find me after the show.
I'll tell you more about it.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.382
{\an3}Okay.
Okay?

20:23.388 --> 20:26.683
{\an3}Oh, sit. I'm really very sorry
about the lousy service.

20:26.767 --> 20:29.811
I-I hired her as a
favor to a friend,

20:29.895 --> 20:32.648
{\an3}and I didn't know she would
do the job that poorly.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.359
{\an3}And I hope this won't
keep you from coming back.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.623
Excuse me. Um, hi.

20:49.706 --> 20:51.458
I-I can't accept this.

20:51.541 --> 20:54.670
{\an1}Not many people would try
and return a $100 bill.

20:54.753 --> 20:57.214
Not many people would leave one.

20:57.297 --> 20:59.758
{\an1}We've got something
in common, then.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.135
What's this?

21:02.219 --> 21:03.303
It's my number.

21:03.387 --> 21:05.347
Use it.

21:14.898 --> 21:16.024
Rules are simple, guys.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.735
First one to turn off loses.

21:18.819 --> 21:19.987
(laughing)

21:22.781 --> 21:24.324
(engine revving)

21:24.408 --> 21:26.910
{\an1}You haven't had anything
to drink, right?

21:26.994 --> 21:28.203
{\an3}Not a drop.

21:28.286 --> 21:29.705
{\an3}You ready?

21:29.788 --> 21:30.998
{\an1}Yeah.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.165
(engine revs)

21:34.793 --> 21:37.379
(tires squealing,
onlookers cheer)

21:39.131 --> 21:41.258
{\an1}I'm not nervous
if you were wondering.

21:41.341 --> 21:43.093
{\an1}I just thought
somebody should know

21:43.176 --> 21:44.511
{\an1}that I'm going to do
something really brave.

21:46.596 --> 21:47.723
I'm going to turn myself in.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.851
Noah, I killed my father.

21:50.934 --> 21:53.520
(engine grows louder)

21:53.603 --> 21:55.022
Noah?!

21:56.314 --> 21:57.858
Noah, turn!

22:03.155 --> 22:05.073
(tires squeal in distance)

22:05.157 --> 22:07.075
What are you, insane?

22:07.159 --> 22:09.077
You trying to get us killed
or something?

22:09.161 --> 22:11.079
It wouldn't turn.
Get out of my car.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.914
{\an3}Come on, admit it,
it was a rush, right?

22:12.998 --> 22:14.916
Get out now!

22:15.000 --> 22:16.251
You can hitch a ride

22:16.334 --> 22:18.336
with one of your fellow
suicide junkies.

22:19.337 --> 22:22.174
(disgusted groan):
Oh, man.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.885
You know what?

22:24.968 --> 22:27.220
You need help
in a really big way.

22:31.683 --> 22:34.186
(tires squeal)

22:46.573 --> 22:49.284
I'm glad you called.

22:49.367 --> 22:52.287
{\an6}(laughs):
I, uh, I have
a boyfriend.

22:52.370 --> 22:54.331
I'm not surprised.

22:54.414 --> 22:57.667
And I'm not interested
in your money, or, um...

22:57.751 --> 23:00.420
or your family's money.

23:00.504 --> 23:03.465
It's just that I'm, um,
I'm new in town and...

23:03.548 --> 23:05.926
And you want to increase
your circle of friends.

23:06.009 --> 23:07.302
Exactly.

23:07.385 --> 23:08.303
Right.

23:08.386 --> 23:10.972
Have you ever been to Paris?

23:11.056 --> 23:13.391
Paris? Um, mm-mm.

23:14.392 --> 23:15.477
Not this season.

23:15.560 --> 23:18.063
I'm, I'm going tomorrow.

23:19.564 --> 23:21.108
On my dad's plane.

23:21.191 --> 23:22.818
It's not as, uh,
quick as a Concorde,

23:22.901 --> 23:25.529
but at least you won't have to
wait in line for the bathroom.

23:25.612 --> 23:26.988
(laughs)

23:27.072 --> 23:29.032
Do you want to go?

23:30.784 --> 23:32.994
Go to Paris?

23:34.204 --> 23:35.580
Just like that?

23:38.500 --> 23:40.961
I-I don't...
I don't even know you.

23:41.044 --> 23:44.131
Well, I, uh, saw your billboard.

23:44.214 --> 23:46.466
Oh. You did.

23:46.550 --> 23:48.301
"Where's Sophie?"

23:48.385 --> 23:51.012
And "Paris" would be
a very good answer.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.556
Unless, of course,

23:52.639 --> 23:54.891
you got something better to do.

24:04.609 --> 24:06.862
Matt?

24:06.945 --> 24:08.864
(quiet grunting nearby)

24:08.947 --> 24:10.282
Hello?

24:11.449 --> 24:12.534
Hello?

24:12.617 --> 24:14.411
What's up?

24:14.494 --> 24:15.412
{\an1}Listen,

24:15.495 --> 24:18.081
when you came by
the beach apartment yesterday,

24:18.165 --> 24:19.374
I couldn't talk.

24:19.457 --> 24:21.334
Really? Why not?

24:21.418 --> 24:23.378
I can't say.

24:23.461 --> 24:24.254
Uh...

24:24.337 --> 24:26.256
{\an1}this whole thing's
just really complicated,

24:26.339 --> 24:28.717
but I promise you
it has nothing to do with Noah.

24:30.760 --> 24:33.221
Were you working up to
some kind of apology?

24:33.305 --> 24:35.724
Oh. Right. Sorry.

24:35.807 --> 24:37.309
Then I forgive you.

24:37.392 --> 24:39.269
What? That's it?
Yeah.

24:39.352 --> 24:41.438
I argue for a living, Donna.

24:41.521 --> 24:43.440
It bores me outside of work.

24:43.523 --> 24:44.858
{\an1}(laughs):
Oh. Oh, that's great--

24:44.941 --> 24:46.943
{\an1}you make me laugh,
and I bore you.

24:47.027 --> 24:49.946
{\an3}I know. It just doesn't
seem fair, does it?

24:50.030 --> 24:52.157
{\an5}No, not at all.
No, not at all.
(laughs)

24:54.326 --> 24:57.078
{\an5}(sighs):
Do you want to go
to Valerie's party?

24:57.162 --> 24:59.372
Oh, I'm, I'm going.

24:59.456 --> 25:02.250
With me.

25:02.334 --> 25:05.212
{\an3}And you're asking
me because...?

25:05.295 --> 25:07.923
{\an1}Did I mention
that laughter thing?

25:08.006 --> 25:09.758
{\an3}And what about old
what's-his-mood?

25:09.841 --> 25:11.551
Did I mention it's a party.
Ah.

25:11.635 --> 25:13.637
So you want to have some fun.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.138
Hmm.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.223
Then I'm your guy.

25:16.306 --> 25:18.099
Cool.

25:24.689 --> 25:26.566
{\an3}DONNA: Hey.
Hey.

25:26.650 --> 25:28.276
Allison's sleeping.
How'd it go?

25:28.360 --> 25:30.445
Well, you know how in the movies
there's always a forger

25:30.528 --> 25:33.448
around every corner, and it's
really easy to get a fake I.D.?

25:33.531 --> 25:35.116
But it doesn't work that way?

25:35.200 --> 25:37.577
No, you need I.D.
to get I.D. here.

25:37.661 --> 25:39.579
I mean, without it,
Leah can move away,

25:39.663 --> 25:41.831
{\an3}but as far as starting a
new life, forget about it.

25:41.915 --> 25:42.707
It's impossible.

25:42.791 --> 25:43.917
{\an1}I won't be able
to open a bank account,

25:44.000 --> 25:47.379
sign a lease, fill out a W-4,
without using my new own name.

25:47.462 --> 25:49.297
I've been following
you all day.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.091
I know what you're doing.

25:51.174 --> 25:52.801
Get away from me.

25:52.884 --> 25:54.928
L-Lenny, I'm gonna
call the police.

25:58.682 --> 26:01.184
You heard the judge--
you can't go anywhere!

26:01.268 --> 26:02.185
{\an3}KELLY:
Yes, I'd like

26:02.269 --> 26:04.771
to report an intruder,
1610 Lighthouse Road.

26:04.854 --> 26:05.772
{\an3}LENNY:
I can't

26:05.855 --> 26:07.607
let you take away my baby.

26:07.691 --> 26:09.901
It's not your
time with her.

26:09.985 --> 26:11.403
Go away.

26:11.486 --> 26:13.321
The police are on their way.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.448
{\an1}Do you hear what
I'm saying to you?

26:15.532 --> 26:17.575
I won't let you go.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.710
(door closes)

26:31.798 --> 26:33.675
STEVE:
Well, I'm just

26:33.758 --> 26:34.676
a city inspector,

26:34.759 --> 26:36.803
but I think a complete retrofit
is unnecessary.

26:36.886 --> 26:38.847
{\an4}What do you think?
My dogs are
killing me.

26:38.930 --> 26:41.891
Well, we'll have a look at the
kitchen area, and we'll be done.

26:41.975 --> 26:43.852
I'm not authorized
to take anyone in there.

26:43.935 --> 26:46.479
{\an3}Are you not authorized,
or are you scared?

26:46.563 --> 26:47.355
Scared of what?

26:47.439 --> 26:49.399
{\an3}The ghost.
(chuckles)

26:49.482 --> 26:51.359
Carson Ponder--

26:51.443 --> 26:53.862
{\an3}one of Marilyn Monroe's
supposed lovers.

26:53.945 --> 26:56.823
Snuck down to the kitchen for
a little midnight snacky-poo.

26:56.906 --> 26:58.199
Got a chicken bone

26:58.283 --> 26:59.743
lodged in his gullet.

26:59.826 --> 27:02.787
{\an3}It was a very violent
and untimely death.

27:02.871 --> 27:05.540
{\an3}They say... you
can still hear him.

27:05.623 --> 27:06.708
{\an1}(choking)

27:06.791 --> 27:09.210
(quiet choking)

27:09.294 --> 27:12.380
FYI: I don't know CPR.

27:12.464 --> 27:15.592
(chuckles):
Come here.

27:15.675 --> 27:19.095
My partner, she's into
the paranormal, big-time.

27:19.179 --> 27:21.681
She begged me
to come on this inspection

27:21.765 --> 27:23.600
just to see the kitchen.

27:23.683 --> 27:25.810
What do you say?

27:28.605 --> 27:32.108
{\an3}Yeah, well, I guess I
could turn a blind eye.

27:32.192 --> 27:34.069
{\an3}But don't expect me
to come along--

27:34.152 --> 27:36.237
I never go in there.

27:36.321 --> 27:37.906
Take your time.

27:37.989 --> 27:39.449
Show yourself out.

27:41.826 --> 27:43.745
{\an5}(singsongy):
We're in--
we got our story.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.372
Scooby-Doo.
(laughs)

27:45.455 --> 27:49.042
(rock music playing)

27:52.462 --> 27:54.381
{\an1}David. Hey.
Hey.

27:54.464 --> 27:55.757
You're not gonna
believe this--

27:55.840 --> 27:57.050
you know that audition?

27:57.133 --> 27:59.094
{\an5}Oh, don't tell me
it went bad.
No.

27:59.177 --> 28:00.428
No. The opposite.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.555
They want to cast me.

28:02.639 --> 28:05.100
{\an1}That's great.
Congratulations.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.769
{\an3}There's only one downside--
it... shoots in Paris.

28:07.852 --> 28:09.104
I leave tomorrow.

28:09.187 --> 28:10.605
Tomorrow?
Yeah.

28:10.688 --> 28:11.773
For how long?

28:11.856 --> 28:14.526
I don't even know.

28:15.777 --> 28:17.654
I'm gonna miss you.

28:17.737 --> 28:20.782
{\an4}(laughs):
Hey, uh, this is exactly
what you wanted,

28:20.865 --> 28:22.951
and we... we can handle

28:23.034 --> 28:25.412
{\an1}a little transcontinental
separation.

28:25.495 --> 28:28.123
{\an3}(laughs):
Yeah, you're right.

28:28.206 --> 28:30.333
I'm really proud of you.

28:31.376 --> 28:32.836
{\an1}Let's go celebrate.
Okay.

28:32.919 --> 28:34.587
Okay?

28:34.671 --> 28:36.339
{\an3}Leah can get
restraining orders.

28:36.423 --> 28:37.298
Lenny would ignore them.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.467
{\an3}If he ignores them,
then he goes to jail.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.136
{\an1}You should have seen
this guy tonight--

28:41.219 --> 28:43.012
{\an1}he's totally unstable,
and he's been following Leah.

28:43.096 --> 28:45.306
Listen, I'll call him--
I will see him tomorrow.

28:45.390 --> 28:46.975
{\an3}That is the
best I can do.

28:47.058 --> 28:49.310
Well, isn't there someone
you can talk to, you know,

28:49.394 --> 28:51.271
{\an1}someone that can get her
false documents,

28:51.354 --> 28:53.314
{\an1}a license, social security
card or something?

28:53.398 --> 28:55.483
She's gonna steal that kid.

28:55.567 --> 28:58.820
{\an5}(sighs):
That's the reason
I couldn't talk on the deck.

28:58.903 --> 29:01.322
Kelly's been trying to help Leah
disappear for days.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.158
She can't do it by herself.

29:03.241 --> 29:04.617
{\an3}Well, good-- because
besides being illegal,

29:04.701 --> 29:07.454
{\an3}living on the run is
no way to raise a child.

29:07.537 --> 29:09.539
VALERIE:
Hey. What do you think

29:09.622 --> 29:11.082
of the dress?

29:11.166 --> 29:12.876
So pathetic.

29:14.627 --> 29:17.505
The noise is so loud, my
chandeliers are rattling!

29:17.589 --> 29:19.048
Oh, you live next-door.

29:19.132 --> 29:20.633
BOUNCER: That's a nice house.
SIMON: Yeah.

29:20.717 --> 29:23.011
{\an6}SIMON:
Either you do something
about this, or I'm gonna

29:23.094 --> 29:24.846
{\an3}call the police--
you got that?

29:24.929 --> 29:26.890
{\an1}Neighbor's threatening
to call the police.

29:26.973 --> 29:29.476
{\an3}Yeah, well, he
can join the club.

29:29.559 --> 29:33.396
{\an1}Is your mother still
threatening to turn you in?

29:33.480 --> 29:36.691
{\an3}No. But I'm thinking
about doing it myself.

29:36.774 --> 29:38.359
Are you kidding me?

29:38.443 --> 29:40.195
Why would you do that?

29:40.278 --> 29:43.281
'Cause it's
the right thing to do.

29:45.283 --> 29:48.411
I'm not afraid of ghosts.
I'm not afraid of ghosts.

29:48.495 --> 29:50.371
{\an3}I'm not afraid
of ghosts.

29:57.337 --> 29:59.255
(whispers):
What's this?

29:59.339 --> 30:03.218
Well, if it's not an exit,
I'm not really interested.

30:06.763 --> 30:09.599
It's one of those
old walk-in refrigerators!

30:09.682 --> 30:12.227
{\an3}Wow, this thing's huge.
(door closes)

30:12.310 --> 30:14.229
And airtight.

30:14.312 --> 30:15.230
Hey!
Hello?

30:15.313 --> 30:16.231
Hello!

30:16.314 --> 30:17.857
Open. Hello?

30:17.941 --> 30:19.400
Oh! Oh, boy.

30:19.484 --> 30:20.610
{\an3}Okay, that's all right,
that's okay,

30:20.693 --> 30:23.404
{\an3}because the, uh, the guard
will come back for us, right?

30:23.488 --> 30:25.698
{\an1}Remember cavernous hotel,
stoner guard--

30:25.782 --> 30:28.868
{\an1}who I paid off to let us
explore this place. (groans)

30:28.952 --> 30:31.746
{\an1}I don't think he's
coming back so soon.

30:31.829 --> 30:33.373
We're dead.

30:33.456 --> 30:35.250
We're dead, and
you killed us.

30:35.333 --> 30:37.418
{\an1}Come on, Janet, where's
your sense of fun?

30:37.502 --> 30:39.087
{\an3}Shh! I don't think
you should talk,

30:39.170 --> 30:40.880
because you're hogging
the oxygen, you moron.

30:40.964 --> 30:42.882
Don't... don't
you shush me.

30:42.966 --> 30:45.260
{\an5}And on top of that...
Why don't you
stop talking!

30:45.343 --> 30:46.761
{\an1}Stop talking? Why don't
you stop talking?!

30:46.844 --> 30:48.429
{\an3}Why don't you stop
repeating everything I say?

30:48.513 --> 30:50.306
{\an5}I'm not repeating
everything you say!
Yes, you are!

30:50.390 --> 30:51.599
{\an3}I'm the one who
was talking first!

30:51.683 --> 30:52.600
Oh, talk, talk, talk...

30:52.684 --> 30:54.435
I'm claustrophobic!

30:54.519 --> 30:56.229
Listen, it's gonna be okay.

30:56.312 --> 30:57.772
{\an3}I hate you.
You know what?

30:57.855 --> 31:00.608
{\an3}I hate you, and those
are gonna be my last...

31:02.527 --> 31:04.279
What on earth...?

31:04.362 --> 31:06.281
Still hate me?

31:06.364 --> 31:07.991
Oh, yeah.

31:12.203 --> 31:13.913
{\an4}(slurring):
Hey, ever seen
Barry Sanders run?

31:13.997 --> 31:15.456
Guy could lose
his own shadow.

31:15.540 --> 31:18.126
Watch this:
He, goes, he goes left.

31:18.209 --> 31:21.504
Back right and
right forward.

31:28.052 --> 31:29.345
Noah.

31:29.429 --> 31:31.097
Are you all right?

31:31.180 --> 31:33.433
Don't leave, okay?

31:33.516 --> 31:34.809
{\an3}Sure.

31:34.892 --> 31:37.729
No, I'm saying,
don't leave me.

31:39.272 --> 31:40.565
All right?

31:47.238 --> 31:49.699
Matt, wait.

31:49.782 --> 31:52.160
Wild guess--
he needs you.

31:52.243 --> 31:55.204
{\an1}I got to take him home.
I'm sorry.

31:56.539 --> 31:58.750
So am I.

32:03.421 --> 32:04.339
{\an3}The neighbors
have complained.

32:04.422 --> 32:06.841
I want to speak to the
person who lives here.

32:06.924 --> 32:08.968
{\an3}Disturbing the peace;
illegal rave...

32:09.052 --> 32:12.055
{\an1}And I killed my father--
boy, they hit the jackpot.

32:12.138 --> 32:15.350
{\an5}Will you let me
talk to them?
No, I'm gonna do it.

32:15.433 --> 32:17.560
{\an6}Would you excuse
us for a second?
No.

32:17.644 --> 32:19.228
It's okay. Um, David knows.

32:19.312 --> 32:20.229
{\an3}DAVID:
Val, I know what

32:20.313 --> 32:22.732
{\an1}you went through; you
didn't do anything wrong.

32:22.815 --> 32:25.026
{\an3}A jury may not
see it that way.

32:25.109 --> 32:26.194
I'm gonna tell them.

32:26.277 --> 32:27.445
{\an3}If you do,
you could spend

32:27.528 --> 32:29.364
{\an3}the rest of your
life in jail.

32:29.447 --> 32:30.531
I'm in jail now.

32:30.615 --> 32:31.699
No, you're not.

32:31.783 --> 32:34.202
Not even close.

32:34.285 --> 32:36.329
{\an6}OFFICER:
Shut that band
down, miss,

32:36.412 --> 32:37.664
or you're
under arrest.

32:37.747 --> 32:39.707
{\an6}Yeah, we'll
do it.
I got it.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.334
Uh...

32:41.417 --> 32:43.086
there's one other thing.

32:51.469 --> 32:52.929
(Valerie sighs)

32:53.012 --> 32:56.015
Sorry for the inconvenience.

33:09.654 --> 33:11.531
Hey.

33:11.614 --> 33:14.367
{\an3}God, I woke up, I didn't
even know where I was.

33:14.450 --> 33:18.413
{\an1}New home, big hangover,
bad combination.

33:18.496 --> 33:20.206
{\an3}I can't believe you
stayed here all night.

33:20.289 --> 33:21.290
Yeah, me neither.

33:22.333 --> 33:23.918
{\an3}Ow!
Come here.

33:24.001 --> 33:24.919
{\an3}Let me see.
(water running)

33:25.002 --> 33:26.254
Oh, it's fine.

33:26.337 --> 33:27.672
{\an1}Yeah, it's fine.
It's just, it's a burn.

33:27.755 --> 33:29.257
{\an1}God, you're gonna
make it worse.

33:29.340 --> 33:30.967
I guess I do that a lot, huh?

33:31.050 --> 33:33.261
{\an1}Yeah, well, why don't you
stop doing it?

33:33.344 --> 33:36.097
{\an1}(sighs)

33:36.180 --> 33:39.100
{\an3}My first AA
meeting's tonight.

33:39.183 --> 33:42.270
{\an1}You're gonna go with
a hangover-- how appropriate.

33:42.353 --> 33:43.604
I'm really out of here.

33:46.023 --> 33:47.567
I'm sorry I ruined your date.

33:50.361 --> 33:52.238
Will you please
take tonight seriously?

33:52.321 --> 33:54.490
Of course.

33:54.574 --> 33:56.284
And every day after that, okay?

33:57.869 --> 33:59.370
Sure.

34:07.378 --> 34:09.130
Look, Matt, I know Val, okay?

34:09.213 --> 34:10.757
She might have chickened out
last night,

34:10.840 --> 34:11.966
but she's gonna do it.

34:12.049 --> 34:14.469
Now, isn't there
some way we can--

34:14.552 --> 34:17.764
I don't know--
intervene legally, something?

34:17.847 --> 34:19.014
Turning herself in

34:19.098 --> 34:21.141
may be stupid,
and it may be self-destructive,

34:21.225 --> 34:22.143
but it's not illegal.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.312
Do you know anyone

34:24.395 --> 34:25.730
she'd listen to?

34:25.813 --> 34:27.774
No.

34:27.857 --> 34:30.485
I mean, no one who might not
make things worse.

34:30.568 --> 34:32.402
Well, at this point,
I don't think that's possible.

34:36.199 --> 34:37.199
Can I use your phone?

34:37.283 --> 34:38.743
Yeah, sure.

34:39.744 --> 34:41.204
(dial tone droning)

34:44.415 --> 34:46.375
(sighs)

34:46.458 --> 34:48.293
Actually, it happens
more than you think,

34:48.377 --> 34:49.670
people having
sex in there.

34:49.754 --> 34:51.130
Hey!

34:51.214 --> 34:52.672
It's a refrigerator.

34:52.757 --> 34:55.051
{\an3}We got locked in,
that's all.

34:55.134 --> 34:56.969
{\an1}Yeah, "Wham bam,
thank you, ma'am,"

34:57.053 --> 34:58.846
{\an1}that's not exactly
my style.

34:58.930 --> 34:59.847
You thought that was

34:59.931 --> 35:01.474
{\an3}"Wham bam, thank
you, ma'am?"

35:01.557 --> 35:03.142
What? You thought
it was meaningful?

35:03.226 --> 35:04.352
Please, in your dreams.

35:04.435 --> 35:07.313
Besides, I don't want people
blabbering all over town, okay?

35:07.396 --> 35:08.689
Well, if there is a ghost,

35:08.773 --> 35:10.608
he's had more than
a few X-rated nights.

35:10.691 --> 35:13.486
{\an1}Yo, bro, there was
no sex, okay?

35:13.569 --> 35:14.529
Nothing happened.

35:14.612 --> 35:17.532
Nothing meaningful, anyway.

35:17.615 --> 35:19.408
{\an3}We slept in our
clothes, all right?

35:21.619 --> 35:23.538
{\an3}Shirt's on
inside out.

35:23.621 --> 35:24.622
Well...

35:33.506 --> 35:34.924
We'll take it.

35:35.007 --> 35:37.260
Great. Which one?

35:37.343 --> 35:38.386
All of them.

35:38.469 --> 35:40.346
{\an3}Oh, Tom, that's
too much.

35:40.429 --> 35:42.557
There's no such thing
as too much.

35:42.640 --> 35:43.558
Especially in Paris.

35:43.641 --> 35:44.600
You're going to Paris?

35:44.684 --> 35:48.271
{\an4}TOM:
London, Madrid--
doesn't matter.

35:48.354 --> 35:50.231
We don't really have
an itinerary.

35:50.314 --> 35:51.315
Itinerary?

35:52.400 --> 35:54.235
I thought you were
doing a movie.

35:54.318 --> 35:55.444
{\an1}You must be
the boyfriend.

35:55.528 --> 35:56.863
DAVID:
Yeah.

35:58.823 --> 35:59.824
Who are you?

36:01.826 --> 36:03.286
I'll be in the car.

36:03.369 --> 36:04.370
Nice meeting you.

36:08.165 --> 36:10.042
I can explain.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.671
{\an6}DAVID:
What's there
to explain?

36:15.298 --> 36:16.757
{\an3}You lied.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.384
{\an3}Again.

36:18.467 --> 36:19.760
{\an1}It's not the way
it looks.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.262
Some rich mama's boy

36:21.345 --> 36:23.598
is taking you to Paris--
what am I missing?

36:23.681 --> 36:27.268
I came to this town
for two reasons, David:

36:27.351 --> 36:29.270
fame and fortune.

36:29.353 --> 36:30.771
I didn't get fame.

36:30.855 --> 36:31.772
No, not in a month.

36:31.856 --> 36:32.648
So I'm taking

36:32.732 --> 36:34.150
my shot at fortune,
unless you think

36:34.233 --> 36:36.319
I should keep taking off my top
in photo shoots.

36:36.402 --> 36:37.361
Seems to be

36:37.445 --> 36:39.113
my only other option.

36:39.196 --> 36:41.073
You mean, besides prostitution?

36:43.326 --> 36:45.411
I'm sorry you see it that way.

37:07.183 --> 37:09.185
Stay.

37:12.730 --> 37:14.732
I can't.

37:32.750 --> 37:33.709
{\an1}ABBY:
Valerie.

37:36.128 --> 37:37.171
Don't.

37:37.254 --> 37:38.839
Mom.

37:38.923 --> 37:41.008
David called me.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.969
He told me
what you're planning to do.

37:44.261 --> 37:45.346
You can't.

37:45.429 --> 37:46.681
No, I have to.

37:46.764 --> 37:48.099
I could've stopped it.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.185
I could've left him.

37:53.062 --> 37:54.730
It's my fault he's dead,
not yours.

37:54.814 --> 37:57.316
It was an accident, you know?

37:58.776 --> 38:01.529
But I wanted to kill him.

38:01.612 --> 38:03.239
He hurt me that much.

38:03.322 --> 38:04.365
I know that.

38:04.448 --> 38:05.866
{\an1}And I know

38:05.950 --> 38:09.203
you can never forgive me
for knowing.

38:11.497 --> 38:14.875
But I-I couldn't stand
thinking about what he...

38:16.335 --> 38:18.963
What I did to you.

38:22.550 --> 38:25.094
After I shot him, I...

38:25.177 --> 38:27.888
I didn't run, I-I didn't scream.

38:29.682 --> 38:31.517
Just stood there
and watched him die.

38:31.600 --> 38:34.103
He was your father.

38:34.186 --> 38:35.396
I know you loved him.

38:35.479 --> 38:36.230
I hated him.

38:36.313 --> 38:38.274
I know that, too.

38:39.692 --> 38:42.737
You've been confusing
the two ever since.

38:44.947 --> 38:47.742
It wasn't your fault.

38:47.825 --> 38:49.785
None of it.

38:49.869 --> 38:52.288
I'm so sorry.

38:54.331 --> 38:55.916
I forgive you.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.086
{\an1}Whatever you think
you've done,

38:59.170 --> 39:02.048
I forgive you.

39:05.468 --> 39:08.387
Now, please, I beg you...

39:09.472 --> 39:11.348
forgive yourself.

39:18.355 --> 39:20.191
KELLY:
Okay.

39:20.274 --> 39:22.276
(phone beeps)

39:22.359 --> 39:26.947
Well, all of the airlines
require picture identification.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.157
So that's it?

39:28.240 --> 39:30.576
I'm trapped?

39:30.659 --> 39:33.120
I'm really sorry.

39:33.204 --> 39:35.164
MATT:
Kelly, it's Matt Durning.

39:35.247 --> 39:37.291
Donna's not here.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.626
I know. She asked me to come by

39:38.709 --> 39:40.753
and see you
and Leah.

39:48.260 --> 39:50.471
All right, I've got a friend
who can help Leah disappear.

39:50.554 --> 39:51.680
{\an3}What? How?

39:51.764 --> 39:52.681
He's a forger,

39:52.765 --> 39:54.350
I got him off on
a technicality,

39:54.433 --> 39:55.434
he owes me a favor.

39:55.518 --> 39:56.936
{\an1}I'll get you
all the new forms

39:57.019 --> 39:57.937
of identification
you're gonna need.

39:58.020 --> 39:59.105
{\an3}KELLY:
How does your client

39:59.188 --> 40:00.106
feel about this?

40:00.189 --> 40:02.483
Well, ignorance is bliss.

40:02.566 --> 40:03.984
I'll never be able
to thank you enough.

40:04.068 --> 40:06.320
{\an3}And I will never be
able to understand you.

40:06.403 --> 40:08.114
{\an3}Couldn't you be
disbarred for this?

40:08.197 --> 40:11.492
{\an1}Well, you got your good risks
and you got your bad.

40:11.575 --> 40:14.328
{\an3}And why are you
gambling now?

40:14.411 --> 40:16.205
{\an1}Let's just say
I like to sleep at night.

40:16.288 --> 40:17.873
Besides, it's no gamble.

40:17.957 --> 40:18.874
I was never here.

40:18.958 --> 40:21.085
{\an3}Okay?

40:21.168 --> 40:22.044
{\an3}Okay?
All right.

40:22.128 --> 40:24.255
{\an1}I'll wait outside
while you pack your things.

40:27.758 --> 40:30.302
Let's pack.

40:30.386 --> 40:31.387
Mm.

40:35.099 --> 40:36.517
Hey.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.227
Hey.

40:38.310 --> 40:40.688
I'm sorry about last night.

40:40.771 --> 40:42.982
Well, you should be.

40:43.065 --> 40:46.318
I told you I was confused.

40:46.402 --> 40:48.612
And it hurts just the same.

40:54.451 --> 40:55.870
{\an1}So how's
the ghost story coming?

40:55.953 --> 40:57.371
Uh, it's coming.

40:57.454 --> 40:59.081
Janet, we're okay
with what happened

40:59.165 --> 41:02.001
in the refrigerator, right?

41:02.084 --> 41:03.669
Uh, yeah... yeah.

41:03.752 --> 41:06.714
I mean, it-it was one of those,
those freak things, you know?

41:06.797 --> 41:07.548
Yeah.

41:07.631 --> 41:10.009
{\an3}Like a result of
unique circumstances.

41:10.092 --> 41:12.219
Yeah. You know, we reacted
just like anyone else would've.

41:12.303 --> 41:13.387
Exactly.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.973
You know, I-I believe that,
that the need to reproduce

41:16.056 --> 41:18.225
{\an3}in the face of death is,
like, genetically encoded.

41:18.309 --> 41:19.268
Yeah, definitely instinctual.

41:19.351 --> 41:21.061
It's animal reflex.

41:21.145 --> 41:22.938
{\an1}Not even worth
mentioning, really.

41:23.022 --> 41:25.691
(rumbling)

41:29.653 --> 41:31.322
Earthquake.
Earthquake.

41:37.620 --> 41:40.247
(jackhammer drilling)

41:43.500 --> 41:44.752
(knocking)

41:44.835 --> 41:46.879
{\an1}It's open.

41:50.382 --> 41:51.383
Hi.

41:51.467 --> 41:53.052
Hey.

41:53.135 --> 41:53.886
Leah got her IDs.

41:53.969 --> 41:55.554
{\an1}She and her daughter
are on their way.

41:55.638 --> 41:56.972
{\an1}I just thought
you should know.

41:57.056 --> 41:58.307
Well, thank you.

42:00.351 --> 42:02.770
I was wrong about you.

42:02.853 --> 42:05.606
I didn't take it personally.

42:05.689 --> 42:07.775
I did.

42:09.818 --> 42:14.281
Well, that's because you're
passionate about your position.

42:14.365 --> 42:15.491
I admire that.

42:15.574 --> 42:18.118
And to you, it was just a job?

42:18.202 --> 42:20.287
Well, look,

42:20.371 --> 42:23.290
theory and practice sometimes
gets severely mixed up.

42:23.374 --> 42:28.003
Like, in theory, Lenny deserved
the best possible defense...

42:28.087 --> 42:29.922
But in reality, he...

42:30.005 --> 42:31.799
What he did was indefensible.

42:31.882 --> 42:33.300
Exactly.

42:33.384 --> 42:36.637
So you just got
a little mixed up.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.264
(chuckles)

42:38.347 --> 42:39.265
What?

42:39.348 --> 42:42.476
As I recall, you came here
to, uh, apologize.

42:42.559 --> 42:44.311
Oh.

42:44.395 --> 42:46.230
Yeah.

42:46.313 --> 42:47.273
I'm just...

42:47.356 --> 42:48.274
Passionate?

42:48.357 --> 42:50.276
Yeah, very.

42:50.359 --> 42:52.695
And I admire that a lot.

42:55.906 --> 42:57.908
(applause)

43:02.413 --> 43:03.330
Hi.

43:03.414 --> 43:06.166
I'm Stan, and I'm an alcoholic.

43:06.250 --> 43:08.544
{\an1}GROUP:
Hi, Stan.

43:08.627 --> 43:11.672
{\an4}STAN:
I haven't had a drink
in three-and-a-half weeks.

43:11.755 --> 43:13.966
{\an1}Feels like about
three-and-a-half years.

43:14.967 --> 43:19.054
{\an1}I still think about
drinking all the time.

43:19.138 --> 43:21.015
{\an1}But I'm learning
to cope with those urges,

43:21.098 --> 43:23.350
{\an1}thanks to the support
of my family

43:23.434 --> 43:26.020
{\an1}and of course
all of you here.

43:26.103 --> 43:28.272
{\an1}I'm taking each day
one at a time.

43:28.355 --> 43:29.565
I know I'm gonna make it.
