WEBVTT

00:20.087 --> 00:22.885
- Tainted Productions.

01:49.873 --> 01:54.240
- No.

06:51.497 --> 06:52.997
Mother fucker.

07:23.100 --> 07:23.931
- Gil.

07:23.933 --> 07:25.108
- Hey there.

07:25.110 --> 07:26.298
- Hey Walter.

07:26.300 --> 07:28.050
- How ya
hanging in there?

07:28.932 --> 07:30.498
- Well just walking
the grounds.

07:30.500 --> 07:31.331
Jesus Christ, Walter,

07:31.333 --> 07:33.918
how'd you keep this
place open for so long?

07:33.920 --> 07:38.068
I'm seeing like six or
seven code violations.

07:38.070 --> 07:39.538
The damn cabins
are falling apart.

07:39.540 --> 07:41.908
- Well friend,
that's why we have you there.

07:41.910 --> 07:43.988
I need that campsite up
and running within a week.

07:43.990 --> 07:45.888
And given your
current situation,

07:45.890 --> 07:48.798
I didn't figure some hard
work and fresh air would hurt.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.208
- That wasn't me
complaining, Walter.

07:50.210 --> 07:51.760
- I
know, Gil, I know.

07:53.440 --> 07:56.128
- Walter, this nurse and
these kids, they know about...

07:56.130 --> 07:58.042
- They know
that you're a handyman

07:58.044 --> 07:59.438
and that's all
they need to know.

07:59.440 --> 08:00.608
- Walter...

08:00.610 --> 08:02.048
- They don't
need to know anything else

08:02.050 --> 08:04.473
other than you and Miss
Hemsgrove are in charge.

08:08.420 --> 08:09.598
- So they're
showing up today?

08:09.600 --> 08:11.448
- They should be
there within the next few hours,

08:11.450 --> 08:13.348
Gil, just do me a favor.

08:13.350 --> 08:14.338
- What?

08:14.340 --> 08:16.158
- They're barely
old enough to drink,

08:16.160 --> 08:17.373
so be patient with 'em.

08:19.150 --> 08:20.868
- Great.
- You'll be fine.

08:20.870 --> 08:22.628
Listen, I'm gonna
jump off here,

08:22.630 --> 08:24.238
I just wanted to check
in and make sure

08:24.240 --> 08:25.768
everything was
going okay for ya.

08:25.770 --> 08:26.601
- Thanks Walter.

08:26.603 --> 08:27.434
- Don't mention it.

08:27.436 --> 08:28.838
I'll call you
tomorrow to check in.

08:28.840 --> 08:29.671
Have a good one.

08:29.673 --> 08:30.937
- You too.

08:39.020 --> 08:39.852
Shit.

09:12.980 --> 09:15.030
- Excuse
me, we're a little lost.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.128
- Uh...

09:18.130 --> 09:19.938
Yeah, where
you tryin' to find?

09:19.940 --> 09:21.593
- Uh, Brook Haven Metro Park?

09:22.960 --> 09:27.271
- Uh, it's
um, five miles that way.

09:29.040 --> 09:29.990
- Thank you.
- Oh.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.778
- My friends,
we have arrived.

10:17.090 --> 10:19.178
- Perfect setting
for several days of food,

10:19.180 --> 10:20.483
booze and debauchery.

10:21.560 --> 10:24.168
- We can talk about
the first two, but,

10:24.170 --> 10:26.248
let's take it easy
on the latter.

10:26.250 --> 10:29.208
- Well hello Mr. Tall
Drink of Water.

10:29.210 --> 10:30.043
Who is you?

10:31.210 --> 10:32.838
- I believe that
would be Mr. Gil.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.698
He's in charge of the
construction program.

10:35.700 --> 10:38.271
- Is that a
first or a last name?

10:38.273 --> 10:39.104
- Why don't you
guys get settled in?

10:39.106 --> 10:40.433
I'm gonna go talk with him.

10:46.310 --> 10:47.738
- Um, and just to be clear,

10:47.740 --> 10:49.115
there is plenty of
room in my bunk

10:49.117 --> 10:50.653
for you two fine-ass women.

10:53.420 --> 10:56.078
Her loss, I guess that just
leaves you, Hannah Montana.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.980
- Yeah, I'd rather sleep on
salty, glass-covered pavement.

11:06.600 --> 11:07.500
- Hello.

11:08.794 --> 11:09.768
- Hey.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.768
- Vanessa
Hemsgrove, I'll be your acting...

11:11.770 --> 11:14.091
- Nurse, yeah,
Walter told me.

11:14.093 --> 11:16.518
- And you must
be Gillum Ross?

11:16.520 --> 11:17.708
- Just Gil.

11:17.710 --> 11:19.078
- Well Walter's had
nothing but great things

11:19.080 --> 11:20.568
to say about you, Gil.

11:20.570 --> 11:21.420
- Likewise.

11:22.570 --> 11:25.048
- Um, just thought I'd
come introduce myself

11:25.050 --> 11:27.850
since we're gonna be working
together the next few days.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.463
Well, I don't
wanna disturb you.

11:33.320 --> 11:35.188
- Uh, just be careful
out there, all right?

11:35.190 --> 11:37.045
- What do you mean?

11:37.047 --> 11:39.138
- Oh, I haven't walked
the rest of the grounds yet,

11:39.140 --> 11:42.228
so I've already found some
hazards, so there'll be others.

11:42.230 --> 11:45.538
Just be careful, and if you
find a hazard, come to me.

11:45.540 --> 11:46.712
- Understood.

11:46.714 --> 11:47.545
- And, it would
be kind of bad

11:47.547 --> 11:49.398
if something happened
to our site nurse, right?

11:49.400 --> 11:51.371
- No, we wouldn't want
that now, would we?

11:51.373 --> 11:54.178
- Someone's liable to get
a bandaid on an ankle, so.

11:54.180 --> 11:55.053
- Duly noted.

12:02.140 --> 12:04.153
- Welcome to the
Pine Hilton, boys.

12:05.194 --> 12:06.494
- No.

12:09.155 --> 12:12.374
- Did you get a side of
tetanus shot with this cabin?

12:35.626 --> 12:36.457
- Daddy's home.

12:36.459 --> 12:38.863
- Ew, dude, get
the fuck outta here.

12:38.865 --> 12:40.308
- What, you know
you want me in.

12:40.310 --> 12:41.143
- Bye Charlie.

12:43.920 --> 12:46.638
So, what are you
ladies up to today?

12:46.640 --> 12:48.458
- Uh, we're probably
gonna lay out.

12:48.460 --> 12:49.628
- Yep.

12:49.630 --> 12:51.578
- I think I'm gonna go
see what Mason's up to.

12:51.580 --> 12:52.958
- Obvious much?

12:52.960 --> 12:53.793
- What?

12:54.690 --> 12:56.604
- Mason is a hunter.

12:56.606 --> 12:57.918
- Mason
doesn't hunt.

12:57.920 --> 12:59.598
- Jesus fucking Christ,

12:59.600 --> 13:02.398
guys like Mason
like the unobtainable.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.713
They like the
thrill of the chase.

13:05.570 --> 13:06.878
- Okay.

13:06.880 --> 13:11.880
- Okay, so he's a lion, and
you're a fucking elephant.

13:12.030 --> 13:13.068
- I'm not fat.

13:13.070 --> 13:16.648
- For fuck sake, Mason
takes one look at you

13:16.650 --> 13:18.238
and he knows he can have you

13:18.240 --> 13:21.128
because, like an
elephant, you're just there,

13:21.130 --> 13:23.148
and fucking obvious.

13:23.150 --> 13:28.150
Mason wants a gazelle that he
can chase down and tear apart.

13:31.625 --> 13:33.073
- Well,

13:34.326 --> 13:36.678
I'm gonna
go get some work done.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.230
You girls have a good day.

14:23.552 --> 14:25.478
- Well, this
could just have to do.

14:25.480 --> 14:27.300
- Well, right to life, right?

14:27.302 --> 14:28.635
- Yeah.

14:37.910 --> 14:39.988
- Well I'm sure we'll
find some great spots

14:39.990 --> 14:41.625
to take some photo shots.

14:41.627 --> 14:43.345
- Yes, I think so.

15:02.178 --> 15:04.178
That was really rude.

15:04.180 --> 15:06.668
- That's not what I meant,
she took it the wrong way.

15:35.099 --> 15:37.446
- What are you
looking at my girls for?

16:05.450 --> 16:06.403
- Harper.

16:07.290 --> 16:08.543
I'm gonna find you.

16:49.061 --> 16:53.147
- Oh, I see what game
we're playing now, huh.

17:09.877 --> 17:12.157
- You found me.

17:12.160 --> 17:13.410
- What do I win?

17:14.321 --> 17:16.321
- You might just win me.

17:17.172 --> 17:20.553
- I like that.

17:20.555 --> 17:22.055
- Oh, I like that.

17:26.906 --> 17:31.106
Oh.

17:53.563 --> 17:56.148
- It says here
that 65% of all people

17:56.150 --> 17:57.638
have sex while
they're camping.

17:57.640 --> 17:59.185
- You get service out here?

17:59.187 --> 18:00.018
- Yeah.

18:00.020 --> 18:02.338
- Bullshit, there's no way.

18:02.340 --> 18:03.171
- Why?

18:03.173 --> 18:04.508
- Because it's a proven fact

18:04.510 --> 18:06.808
that once people get away
from the fuss of civilization,

18:06.810 --> 18:09.548
they let their primal
side come out.

18:09.550 --> 18:10.958
This number's
gotta be higher.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.088
- How much higher?

18:12.090 --> 18:14.071
- 95%, at least.

18:14.073 --> 18:15.338
- Eh, I highly doubt it.

18:15.340 --> 18:16.678
- Why, I mean,
think about it,

18:16.680 --> 18:18.338
campfire, peace and quiet,

18:18.340 --> 18:22.660
nobody around for miles,
primal instincts kick in, baby.

18:22.662 --> 18:23.493
Well,

18:23.495 --> 18:26.151
you obviously don't
understand how pussy works.

18:43.350 --> 18:46.028
- Yeah, not to mention it'd
be, like, super uncomfortable.

18:46.030 --> 18:49.148
I mean, scraped
knees, elbows,

18:49.150 --> 18:50.838
branches and
rocks under you, eh.

18:50.840 --> 18:51.951
- You need to
shut that shit down.

18:51.953 --> 18:53.728
- It just means you're not
doing it right, Courtney.

18:53.730 --> 18:55.728
Always be on top.

18:55.730 --> 18:56.561
- That's right.
- Good point.

18:56.563 --> 18:58.122
- That's right,
always be on top.

18:58.124 --> 19:01.241
And by the way, they make
stereotypes about this thing

19:01.243 --> 19:02.610
in horror movies and stuff,

19:02.612 --> 19:04.250
and there's gotta be a
reason for that, right?

19:04.252 --> 19:05.083
- Yeah.

19:05.085 --> 19:06.678
- Yeah, and
girls just love it

19:06.680 --> 19:08.888
when you stick it up their
ass, just like in porn, too.

19:08.890 --> 19:10.390
- No.
- Really?

19:10.392 --> 19:11.238
- No.
- Really.

19:11.240 --> 19:13.528
- No, I was being fascist.

19:13.530 --> 19:14.980
- Facetious.

19:14.982 --> 19:16.231
- Whatever.

19:22.041 --> 19:24.541
- Hey Charlie,
grab me that bottle of SPF.

19:25.870 --> 19:27.413
Today, preferably.

19:27.415 --> 19:28.915
- Whoa, hey tiger.

19:32.090 --> 19:33.403
- Don't miss my shoulders.

19:35.530 --> 19:37.098
- I mean, don't get
me wrong, though,

19:37.100 --> 19:38.478
if I was walking
through the woods

19:38.480 --> 19:40.608
and that Gil guy showed up...

19:40.610 --> 19:41.808
- That guy?

19:41.810 --> 19:43.678
He's like 40!

19:43.680 --> 19:46.441
Not to mention, he's as bald
as Tasha's stabbing cabin.

19:46.443 --> 19:49.758
- Okay, I really
like bald guys and he's older,

19:49.760 --> 19:51.518
which means he doesn't
have to be trained as much.

19:51.520 --> 19:53.761
- Amen to that.

19:53.763 --> 19:56.048
- Just right in there, bro',
just right,

19:56.050 --> 19:57.563
- Yeah bro', get in there.

20:00.617 --> 20:02.124
- You like that, baby?

20:02.126 --> 20:04.215
Nicole, Nicole!

20:08.703 --> 20:11.020
- Charlie's
got mahogany.

20:11.022 --> 20:12.701
What?

20:12.703 --> 20:15.468
- Dude, it
was like 10 seconds.

20:15.470 --> 20:18.632
- It's human
nature, it's primal.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.381
- You underwhelm me.

20:22.383 --> 20:26.566
- Oh.

20:29.033 --> 20:31.861
- What the fuck am I
supposed to do with this?

20:31.863 --> 20:34.478
- Prove to us you're
not a two-pump chump.

20:34.480 --> 20:35.930
- Come the fuck on.

20:38.392 --> 20:40.450
- How about you and I
take a walk over there?

20:40.452 --> 20:41.832
- Mm, walk huh?

20:41.834 --> 20:44.008
- Mmhmm.
- Mmm, is that all?

20:44.010 --> 20:47.592
- Oh no, I'm pretty sure we
can figure other things to do.

20:47.594 --> 20:50.221
- Mm, oh yeah?
- Oh yeah.

21:03.350 --> 21:04.408
- What's
happening, hot stuff?

21:04.410 --> 21:06.538
- I thought you guys went
to lay out or something?

21:06.540 --> 21:08.228
- We were, but
Charlie got religion

21:08.230 --> 21:10.233
while putting
sunscreen on me.

21:10.235 --> 21:11.084
What?

21:11.086 --> 21:12.268
I can't reach my back.

21:12.270 --> 21:13.103
- Uh huh.

21:14.930 --> 21:16.548
It's not what you think.

21:16.550 --> 21:18.168
- Oh sure.

21:18.170 --> 21:19.718
You know what, I don't
think you're as immune

21:19.720 --> 21:22.533
to the rigors of careless
sex after all, Nurse Betty.

21:23.550 --> 21:25.558
- Contrary to popular belief,

21:25.560 --> 21:29.115
there are more important
things to talk about than just sex.

21:29.117 --> 21:30.117
- Really, like what?

21:31.430 --> 21:34.008
- Like fixing this cabin.

21:34.010 --> 21:37.368
And Mr. Gil is doing a great
job adhering to all the rules

21:37.370 --> 21:39.835
and I think we should
follow his example.

21:56.707 --> 21:57.540
- Well,

22:01.278 --> 22:02.778
looks pretty nice.

22:04.850 --> 22:05.893
I like it out here.

22:07.440 --> 22:08.373
This is nice,

22:09.700 --> 22:10.533
real nice.

22:12.474 --> 22:14.391
- Help you with something?

22:14.393 --> 22:18.459
- Got a nice
setup out here, huh?

22:18.461 --> 22:19.340
- It's all right.

22:19.342 --> 22:21.038
- All right?

22:21.040 --> 22:22.688
Yeah, I'll say
it's all right.

22:22.690 --> 22:27.643
Jesus, wide, open space,
freedom to go about your day,

22:28.620 --> 22:31.220
I bet you get a nice workout
out here too, don't ya?

22:32.220 --> 22:33.098
- Sure.

22:33.100 --> 22:33.933
- Sure.

22:34.980 --> 22:36.178
Yeah, it's really nice.

22:36.180 --> 22:39.148
Oh, and the poon
walking around here,

22:39.150 --> 22:40.863
holy Mary mother of fuck.

22:41.950 --> 22:44.153
Bet you're just in Heaven
out here, aren't you?

22:46.270 --> 22:48.788
Come on, Gil,
you can't tell me

22:48.790 --> 22:50.908
the thought hasn't
crossed your mind.

22:50.910 --> 22:53.738
After five years, I would've
thought you would have

22:53.740 --> 22:57.215
worn one of these fur burgers
as a flesh condom by now.

22:57.217 --> 22:58.228
- Are you kidding?

22:58.230 --> 23:01.028
Look at him, he would
wanna bitch any one of us

23:01.030 --> 23:02.398
if given the opportunity.

23:02.400 --> 23:03.231
You can see it in his eyes.

23:03.233 --> 23:05.611
- I seriously doubt that.

23:05.613 --> 23:07.640
- Well, we'll see about that.

23:07.642 --> 23:11.088
- Gil is
way too old for you.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.968
- So was my therapist.

23:12.970 --> 23:13.801
- God.

23:13.803 --> 23:15.848
- Uh, five oh is here.

23:15.850 --> 23:17.458
Did somebody order bacon?

23:17.460 --> 23:19.883
- I have no idea.

23:24.402 --> 23:26.313
- Ah, there he is.

23:27.990 --> 23:30.383
What's wrong,
push your button?

23:31.410 --> 23:32.308
- No sir.

23:32.310 --> 23:33.578
- No sir?

23:33.580 --> 23:34.530
That's really good.

23:35.950 --> 23:37.368
See, it'd a been a
shame if you timed out

23:37.370 --> 23:40.483
to go right back in,
assaulting an officer of the law.

23:41.442 --> 23:42.581
Know what I mean?

23:42.583 --> 23:44.035
- Is there something I
can help you with, officer?

23:44.037 --> 23:45.318
- And you are?

23:45.320 --> 23:47.928
- Vanessa Hemsgrove,
the nurse here at the camp.

23:47.930 --> 23:49.651
- Mrs. Hemsgrove.

23:49.653 --> 23:50.484
- Miss.

23:50.486 --> 23:52.878
- Ah Miss, well, no
need to be alarmed,

23:52.880 --> 23:54.938
just taking up my
friend, Gil here,

23:54.940 --> 23:57.928
standard procedure to
keep tabs on ex-cons.

23:57.930 --> 23:59.703
- Wait, so this
guy's an ex-con?

24:00.680 --> 24:03.718
- They can't be around
girls and such, right?

24:03.720 --> 24:06.288
- Depends on what
they were locked up for.

24:06.290 --> 24:08.011
- Mr. Gil's doing a find job.

24:08.013 --> 24:10.443
- Mr. Gil.

24:11.850 --> 24:13.298
That's cute.

24:13.300 --> 24:15.248
- You're interrupting
Mr. Gil's job,

24:15.250 --> 24:16.428
so if there was something,

24:16.430 --> 24:18.040
someone you'd
like to speak with...

24:18.042 --> 24:20.792
- No no no, that's
not necessary.

24:35.842 --> 24:37.868
You behave yourself, Gil,

24:37.870 --> 24:39.028
I don't wanna get
any phone calls

24:39.030 --> 24:40.058
from any of
these fine ladies,

24:40.060 --> 24:42.268
saying that you've
misbehaved.

24:42.270 --> 24:43.103
We clear?

24:44.090 --> 24:44.923
- Crystal.

24:46.010 --> 24:46.960
- Well that's good.

24:48.480 --> 24:51.233
All righty, you folks
have a great day.

24:52.520 --> 24:54.573
We'll see you soon, Mr. Gil.

24:58.218 --> 25:00.123
- Don't you
got something to do?

25:01.130 --> 25:03.921
- Tsk tsk tsk, naughty boy.

25:03.923 --> 25:05.980
- Go.

25:05.982 --> 25:08.617
- We
got stuff to, do.

25:38.740 --> 25:39.746
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:40.581 --> 25:42.228
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

25:42.230 --> 25:43.718
- There she is.

25:43.720 --> 25:47.018
- Yeah yeah,
so what's the skinny?

25:47.020 --> 25:49.968
- The skinny, people
still say shit like that?

25:49.970 --> 25:51.358
- Yes, just 'cause
I'm a little older

25:51.360 --> 25:54.179
doesn't mean I don't
still know the hip lingo.

25:54.181 --> 25:55.615
Yeah, the hip lingo, okay.

25:57.620 --> 25:58.528
- No uh,

25:58.530 --> 26:02.628
we were actually just
discussing our ex-con handyman.

26:02.630 --> 26:04.108
- Listen, I get you guys

26:04.110 --> 26:07.298
may be a little confused
or on edge, but trust me,

26:07.300 --> 26:10.168
you literally have
nothing to worry about.

26:10.170 --> 26:12.573
- Why, just 'cause the
boss-man said it's cool?

26:13.760 --> 26:16.118
Yeah, that makes me
feel so much better.

26:16.120 --> 26:18.008
- Things like this is normal.

26:18.010 --> 26:19.478
Sometimes when
people's been in the system,

26:19.480 --> 26:21.867
they need a little
assistance on a job and Mr.,

26:22.734 --> 26:24.318
I mean, he's been
staying to himself.

26:24.320 --> 26:26.008
Just leave him alone.

26:26.010 --> 26:26.998
- All I know is
people like that

26:27.000 --> 26:29.138
have a lot of pent up
aggression and shit.

26:29.140 --> 26:31.653
- Oh yeah, and how many
ex-con men do you know?

26:33.610 --> 26:35.078
That's what I thought.

26:35.080 --> 26:37.178
And you too, weren't
you just saying

26:37.180 --> 26:39.368
you were into his
sexy, working man vibe,

26:39.370 --> 26:41.318
literally a few hours ago?

26:41.320 --> 26:43.071
Yeah, you were.

26:43.073 --> 26:45.598
- That was before they knew
he got locked up, though.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.300
- I think it just
makes it sexier.

26:49.581 --> 26:53.691
- Always a sucker for
the bad boys, huh Tasha?

26:53.693 --> 26:57.308
- Lay off Gil already,
he's keeping to himself,

26:57.310 --> 26:59.498
we don't need you all
making it a little bit awkward.

26:59.500 --> 27:01.698
- I still wanna know
what he was locked up for.

27:01.700 --> 27:03.088
- My bet's drugs.

27:03.090 --> 27:04.418
I think he got
caught running.

27:04.420 --> 27:06.990
- Nah, he looks like a
breaking and entering guy.

27:07.920 --> 27:10.968
- Jesus Christ, creep much?

27:10.970 --> 27:11.801
- Miley.

27:11.803 --> 27:12.636
- What?

27:14.460 --> 27:16.373
- I just came to
check out the fire.

27:25.004 --> 27:26.698
- So come on, Gil, what'd
you get locked up for?

27:26.700 --> 27:29.388
- That's
none of your business.

27:29.390 --> 27:31.808
- Well, about five years ago,

27:31.810 --> 27:33.783
friend of mine,
came, asked for help,

27:34.760 --> 27:37.663
he got in with some bad
people, owed a lot of money.

27:39.890 --> 27:40.723
- What's a lot?

27:43.375 --> 27:44.208
- About 500.

27:45.044 --> 27:47.613
- $500,
that's not a lot.

27:48.897 --> 27:50.459
- $500,000.

27:50.461 --> 27:51.628
- Fuck.
- Damn.

27:54.120 --> 27:56.058
- So what happened?

27:56.060 --> 28:00.208
- Well, he came to me, had
a plan about scrapping cars

28:00.210 --> 28:02.508
to make money
to pay the debt off.

28:02.510 --> 28:04.758
- Doesn't sound like you'd
make that much money.

28:04.760 --> 28:07.588
I mean, not $500,000.

28:07.590 --> 28:11.048
- Well it wouldn't, but if you
can make cars disappear,

28:11.050 --> 28:12.318
it would.

28:12.320 --> 28:15.363
Cars that belong
to very bad people.

28:16.870 --> 28:19.370
And so that's what we did,
we made cars disappear.

28:20.410 --> 28:23.598
- Wait a second, you're
telling me you ran a chop shop?

28:23.600 --> 28:24.433
- We did.

28:25.590 --> 28:28.518
And the money
flowed in like a flood.

28:28.520 --> 28:30.120
He was able to
pay off his debt.

28:31.860 --> 28:33.038
Shoulda stopped though.

28:33.040 --> 28:33.873
We didn't.

28:34.904 --> 28:36.428
We got greedy.

28:36.430 --> 28:37.730
- So how'd you get caught?

28:38.980 --> 28:42.048
- Eh, it seems we weren't
as close as I thought we were.

28:42.050 --> 28:44.423
Cops got wind of the
operation, brought him in,

28:45.610 --> 28:46.838
basically offered him a deal

28:46.840 --> 28:48.488
which would pin the
whole thing on me.

28:48.490 --> 28:49.540
- So he sold you out.

28:50.860 --> 28:53.658
- Damn dude, that
is cold blooded.

28:53.660 --> 28:56.488
- Yeah, he uh,
basically got probation

28:56.490 --> 28:59.798
and I got 10 years,
sentenced to state prison,

28:59.800 --> 29:02.143
Lebanon State Prison,

29:03.800 --> 29:05.700
served five, got out
on good behavior.

29:06.944 --> 29:08.594
- Fuck.

29:13.350 --> 29:14.508
- To Gil.

29:14.510 --> 29:16.870
- The unluckiest
car-killer alive.

29:22.810 --> 29:23.958
Hey, where are you
two headed off to,

29:23.960 --> 29:25.571
the party's just
getting started.

29:25.573 --> 29:27.298
- Eh, we're gonna
take a little stroll

29:27.300 --> 29:29.708
and make a little
party of our own.

29:29.710 --> 29:32.419
- Now guys, stay
close, take a flashlight.

29:32.421 --> 29:36.898
- But if we're too close,
you'll hear us.

29:36.900 --> 29:39.558
- Try to keep some
reservations about yourselves.

29:39.560 --> 29:43.318
- Yeah, and uh, watch out
for snakes and Poison Ivy,

29:43.320 --> 29:45.262
and um, herpes.

29:45.264 --> 29:46.958
Fuck you, douche schnakal.

29:46.960 --> 29:49.328
- Hey, if that's an offer, I
am down for a love sandwich.

29:49.330 --> 29:51.016
Courtney, you can
be the roast beef.

29:51.018 --> 29:52.405
- Oh.

29:54.587 --> 29:55.504
- Fuck off.

29:56.999 --> 29:58.168
- Roast beef?

29:58.170 --> 29:59.920
- I know you love
roast beef, dude.

30:04.150 --> 30:07.558
- Listen, roast beef,
wait here,

30:07.560 --> 30:11.138
count to 10, and then follow
the trail and come find me.

30:11.140 --> 30:12.229
- Why?

30:12.231 --> 30:13.368
- 'Cause I have
a surprise for you.

30:13.370 --> 30:14.498
- What kind of surprise?

30:14.500 --> 30:17.683
- It's gonna be a big surprise,
it's gonna blow your mind.

30:18.970 --> 30:20.863
- Okay.

30:23.730 --> 30:25.173
- So you're in to bad boys?

30:29.330 --> 30:30.423
I could be a bad boy.

30:44.841 --> 30:46.578
Where you headed off to?

30:46.580 --> 30:49.499
- Anywhere you're
not.

31:03.768 --> 31:05.003
- Tah dah!

31:05.005 --> 31:05.836
- What?

31:05.838 --> 31:06.708
- Yeah?

31:06.710 --> 31:08.718
You wanna get in the tent
or you wanna mull it over?

31:08.720 --> 31:10.809
- Oh
my God.

31:10.811 --> 31:12.967
- Get in.

31:12.969 --> 31:14.993
Yeah see, look.

31:16.127 --> 31:17.448
I brought a bag of toys.
- Oh.

31:17.450 --> 31:19.143
- And bug-free.

31:19.989 --> 31:23.685
- All right, so I
admit, I like the tent,

31:23.687 --> 31:26.376
but explain this.
- What?

31:26.378 --> 31:27.209
Oh this.
- Yeah.

31:27.211 --> 31:29.818
- Oh, you know how
cosplay is my kink.

31:29.820 --> 31:30.651
- Uh huh.
- Yeah,

31:30.653 --> 31:31.847
you remember the
thing with the fairies?

31:31.849 --> 31:32.680
- Mmhmm.
- Shh,

31:32.682 --> 31:34.008
let's not talk about that,
it was a dark time for us.

31:34.010 --> 31:36.848
But this, like look,
we're out in the woods,

31:36.850 --> 31:38.648
it's like an 80's movie
with the hockey masks

31:38.650 --> 31:40.198
and the stabbings
and things like that,

31:40.200 --> 31:42.468
and I'm like the unruly
camper and you're like

31:42.470 --> 31:46.199
the hot, sexy, camp counselor
that I'm just tryin' to fuck.

31:46.201 --> 31:47.032
Yeah.

31:47.034 --> 31:48.588
- Don't they
usually die in those movies?

31:48.590 --> 31:50.298
- Yeah, but we're just
gonna do the sex part.

31:50.300 --> 31:51.398
- That's
when they die.

31:51.400 --> 31:52.808
- Yeah, but we're just
gonna do the sex part.

31:52.810 --> 31:53.648
- Oh my God.

31:53.650 --> 31:56.593
- Oh, or, I could
be a bounty hunter.

31:58.380 --> 32:00.178
- Okay,
now we're talkin'.

32:00.180 --> 32:01.280
- You're under arrest.

32:03.230 --> 32:05.358
You have the right
to remain naked,

32:05.360 --> 32:07.170
you take that off
and I'll take this off,

32:07.172 --> 32:08.418
'cause I have that right too.

32:08.420 --> 32:09.668
It's equal rights
around here.

32:09.670 --> 32:12.668
You have the right,
give me this, goddamn it.

32:12.670 --> 32:14.527
Just take that off, fuckin',

32:16.560 --> 32:19.293
Anything you say can and
will be held against my body.

32:20.340 --> 32:22.488
Your dick smuggling
days are over!

32:22.490 --> 32:25.780
You will take these off and
you are going downtown,

32:25.782 --> 32:27.430
gimme, gimme 'em.

32:51.590 --> 32:54.168
- You know, if you
ask me, that's just rude.

32:54.170 --> 32:55.948
I mean, we're all here,
having a good time, right,

32:55.950 --> 32:59.598
having fun, and they
just get up and walk off.

32:59.600 --> 33:00.603
Come on!

33:10.333 --> 33:12.648
- I didn't think
you got the hint.

33:12.650 --> 33:13.900
- Oh, I got it.

33:15.221 --> 33:16.709
- You got it, huh?

33:16.711 --> 33:18.168
- Yeah.

33:18.170 --> 33:23.170
- Wanna see it?

33:36.330 --> 33:37.961
- Oh fuck.

33:42.483 --> 33:46.121
- Well uh, I guess it's just
you and me, kitten whiskers.

33:48.340 --> 33:49.703
- No Charlie.

33:51.450 --> 33:52.400
It's just you, boo.

33:54.850 --> 33:55.733
I'm crashing.

34:02.000 --> 34:02.953
- I think I'm in love.

34:03.880 --> 34:05.099
- Playing hard
to get, that's fine.

34:05.101 --> 34:06.028
- Yeah.

34:06.030 --> 34:07.380
- Get over here, criminals.

34:08.469 --> 34:11.628
All right, so, woop, you
like these underwear,

34:11.630 --> 34:13.380
you criminal,
that's right, you do.

34:14.330 --> 34:15.663
Get out of here.

34:16.550 --> 34:19.088
Here.

34:19.090 --> 34:20.047
Here we are.
- Oh.

34:20.050 --> 34:21.193
- There we go.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.072
There you go.

34:28.911 --> 34:29.830
Gotta like that,

34:29.831 --> 34:32.458
you're the best camp
counselor I've ever had.

34:32.460 --> 34:34.840
Too bad I had to arrest you.

34:34.842 --> 34:37.938
Ye haw, come on!

34:37.940 --> 34:40.199
- Oh now, mm mm, we
did cowboys last time.

34:40.202 --> 34:41.967
- Okay, sorry sorry sorry.

35:56.690 --> 36:00.628
- So uh, I'm like super
tired, I mean it's like,

36:00.630 --> 36:01.910
what time, like 2:00?

36:03.447 --> 36:04.280
- 10:30.

36:05.353 --> 36:06.633
- Really?

36:07.730 --> 36:08.563
Shit.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.033
- Tell you what, man, in the
shed, underneath the mattress.

36:15.117 --> 36:15.950
- Okay.

36:21.800 --> 36:25.008
- So, what are
you doing here?

36:25.010 --> 36:26.610
You know my
story, what's yours?

36:27.970 --> 36:29.573
- Not much of
a story to tell.

36:30.540 --> 36:32.678
- Oh, I don't believe
that for a second.

36:32.680 --> 36:33.993
- What makes you say that?

36:35.277 --> 36:38.618
- Well because Walter
told me a little bit about you.

36:38.620 --> 36:43.620
Graduated St. Johns in a
DSNC with para-anesthesiology.

36:45.748 --> 36:46.831
- Impressive.

36:47.810 --> 36:48.948
- Just because
I'm a simple guy

36:48.950 --> 36:52.078
doesn't mean I'm a stupid
one, Miss Hemsgrove.

36:52.080 --> 36:55.327
- Ah, I knew you'd
like this mullet ride.

36:55.329 --> 36:58.198
Ah, I know,

36:58.200 --> 37:01.068
that's what mullets do,
they're magical.

37:03.706 --> 37:05.344
All right, okay.

37:05.346 --> 37:08.508
All right, you criminal,
'bout ready to take you in.

37:08.510 --> 37:09.918
- Yeah?
- Oh yeah.

37:09.920 --> 37:12.370
Okay.

37:12.372 --> 37:15.493
Okay, oh okay.

37:16.410 --> 37:19.333
Oh, that's
mullet magic, baby.

37:20.650 --> 37:23.253
Oh.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.059
- Shit.

37:27.061 --> 37:29.150
- Did you like that?

37:29.152 --> 37:31.608
- Yeah.

37:31.610 --> 37:33.430
- You gotta pee?

37:33.432 --> 37:34.598
Well don't do it here.

37:37.650 --> 37:40.178
- Do you think I could
grow a mullet on my pubes?

38:04.159 --> 38:06.576
- God fuckin' bless you, Gil.

38:08.218 --> 38:09.593
Girl.

38:51.360 --> 38:53.568
- So, why after all of that,

38:53.570 --> 38:57.023
would you be wasting
your skills as a nurse here?

38:57.950 --> 39:01.153
Seems like, to me, you're
running from something.

39:03.770 --> 39:04.603
Or someone.

39:17.499 --> 39:18.330
- Let's just say,

39:18.332 --> 39:20.973
when you're in a
relationship with your boss,

39:22.550 --> 39:26.568
it casts a dark shadow over
someone with a career like mine

39:26.570 --> 39:31.570
and when said boss fails to
let you know that he's married,

39:34.180 --> 39:35.013
yeah.

39:36.305 --> 39:38.488
- Then you just
move locations,

39:38.490 --> 39:40.138
you don't take the
cheapest paying job,

39:40.140 --> 39:42.016
watching a bunch of kids.

39:44.746 --> 39:48.888
- What the fuck
is that?

39:48.890 --> 39:51.728
- Yeah, they seem a little
rough around the edges at times,

39:51.730 --> 39:54.083
but they're really good kids.

39:56.070 --> 39:59.940
- Well, to us,
society's misfits.

41:28.875 --> 41:31.228
- Good
morning, sweet cheeks.

41:31.230 --> 41:32.580
Now you're just teasing me.

41:37.710 --> 41:39.148
- Rough night?

41:39.150 --> 41:41.053
- Oh, I was just
being a lion tamer.

41:48.105 --> 41:49.772
- What's up her ass?

41:53.434 --> 41:55.362
- Miss Hemsgrove.

41:55.364 --> 41:56.364
- Mr. Gil.

41:58.800 --> 41:59.750
- Missing somebody?

42:00.910 --> 42:03.748
- You know, I've not seen
Will or Court this morning.

42:03.750 --> 42:05.768
- That's funny, I didn't hear
'em come in last night either.

42:05.770 --> 42:07.786
- You apparently wouldn't
have heard shit after all this...

42:08.690 --> 42:11.878
- Anyways, he didn't sneak
into your guy's bunk last night,

42:11.880 --> 42:12.713
did he?

42:15.505 --> 42:18.058
- I told
them to stay close.

42:18.060 --> 42:19.248
- I'm sure they're fine.

42:19.250 --> 42:20.318
I'll go look for
them in a minute.

42:20.320 --> 42:23.653
I'm sure they just uh,
passed out after their walk.

42:24.949 --> 42:25.780
- Anyone of you know how much

42:25.782 --> 42:27.323
a fully grown
brown bear weighs?

42:29.070 --> 42:31.953
- About 500 pounds.

42:34.760 --> 42:36.978
- Please
tell me you're joking.

42:36.980 --> 42:38.488
- Nope.

42:38.490 --> 42:39.858
But do I think
something happened?

42:39.860 --> 42:40.968
Not really.

42:40.970 --> 42:42.528
But it's something that needs
to be on all of your minds

42:42.530 --> 42:44.880
if you decide to trek
out into the woods alone.

42:46.921 --> 42:49.288
- Well uh, I'll make
sure to keep that in mind,

42:49.290 --> 42:50.868
but do we, by
chance have, like,

42:50.870 --> 42:54.283
a rifle on site, or
something, just in case?

42:58.580 --> 43:00.898
Forgot, ex-con.

43:00.900 --> 43:02.628
- Tell you what, Chuck,

43:02.630 --> 43:04.488
why don't you use
your winning personality

43:04.490 --> 43:05.718
if you run into wildlife?

43:05.720 --> 43:07.270
It should be a
solid deterrent.

43:08.900 --> 43:11.159
- By the way, you
smell like Mason's dick.

43:11.161 --> 43:14.245
- Oh, better than smelling
like loneliness and depression.

43:29.304 --> 43:33.144
- Help me,
help me!

43:33.146 --> 43:34.071
Help me!

43:34.073 --> 43:36.028
- Hey, hey, whoa whoa whoa!
- Let go of me!

43:36.030 --> 43:38.922
Easy, easy.

43:44.604 --> 43:45.437
- Yes!

43:46.672 --> 43:49.778
- Let me go!
- Chill!

43:49.780 --> 43:52.923
- You don't understand,
it's out there!

43:53.965 --> 43:56.048
My friends, they're all...

43:58.113 --> 43:59.063
Jesus Gil,

43:59.065 --> 44:00.417
are you okay?

44:00.419 --> 44:02.053
- God.
- Come help me.

44:03.920 --> 44:05.246
Get him up.

44:09.710 --> 44:12.046
Somebody get her up and
let's get her to the med-bed.

44:12.048 --> 44:14.223
- Who
the fuck is this bitch?

44:14.225 --> 44:16.685
- You're taking
grandpa, I'll carry her.

44:26.666 --> 44:31.316
- Jesus.

44:44.607 --> 44:45.440
- Will!

44:48.810 --> 44:50.553
Will, where are you?

45:13.107 --> 45:15.358
- She's so bloody.

45:15.360 --> 45:17.113
Laceration on her forehead,

45:18.240 --> 45:19.733
laceration on left thigh.

45:23.340 --> 45:24.628
- You okay?

45:24.630 --> 45:27.327
- Yeah, just
a little unexpected is all.

45:31.425 --> 45:33.188
- Are you okay?

45:33.190 --> 45:34.340
- I'll be fine.

45:35.604 --> 45:38.272
What the hell
happened to her?

45:45.907 --> 45:46.824
- Courtney!

45:48.464 --> 45:49.297
Will!

45:52.930 --> 45:55.063
Was that roast beef
an all-night buffet?

46:00.610 --> 46:02.108
- She's stable for now.

46:02.110 --> 46:04.708
Let's check back
on her in a few hours.

46:04.710 --> 46:06.774
- A few hours?

46:06.776 --> 46:07.718
What the fuck did
you hit her with?

46:07.720 --> 46:08.903
- A sedative.

46:10.440 --> 46:12.063
- Okay, so what do we do now?

46:14.350 --> 46:16.518
- I think it's
time to make that call.

46:16.520 --> 46:17.818
- Agreed.

46:17.820 --> 46:19.920
- Tash, can you go
and get the sat. Phone?

46:21.580 --> 46:24.538
You two, I want everyone
back at this camp before sunset,

46:24.540 --> 46:26.818
no more wandering around.

46:26.820 --> 46:28.948
Go get Charlie, look
for Will and Courtney,

46:28.950 --> 46:31.100
bring 'em back here
to the nurse's station.

46:46.096 --> 46:47.562
- What the fuck?

46:55.070 --> 46:56.273
Jesus fucking Christ.

47:06.117 --> 47:06.948
Oh shit.

47:06.950 --> 47:08.550
I guess we're doing this.

47:11.916 --> 47:13.249
- You all right?

47:14.490 --> 47:18.073
- I don't know, just
something's not right.

47:18.991 --> 47:21.648
- Other than the obvious?

47:21.650 --> 47:25.048
- Maybe I'm being paranoid,
but

47:25.050 --> 47:27.008
she comes running
out of nowhere,

47:27.010 --> 47:28.728
damn near ferrel,

47:28.730 --> 47:32.223
talking about something
being out in the woods.

47:34.302 --> 47:36.668
- We're about 50 miles away
from the nearest civilization,

47:36.670 --> 47:38.028
it's not really painting a...

47:38.030 --> 47:40.553
- Gil, you might wanna
come look at this.

47:42.382 --> 47:43.299
- What now?

47:45.360 --> 47:46.873
Clean up, you look like shit.

47:48.140 --> 47:51.021
I'll figure out
what's going on.

47:58.680 --> 48:02.713
- Oh shit.

48:08.444 --> 48:12.004
What the fuck?

48:33.984 --> 48:34.901
- You okay?

48:35.740 --> 48:38.843
- Yeah, my ankle
still hurts a bit.

48:39.873 --> 48:41.062
- Let me see.

48:44.323 --> 48:47.369
Oh yeah, definitely a sprain.

48:50.070 --> 48:50.903
Sorry.

48:51.760 --> 48:52.660
- Um, you're fine.

48:53.720 --> 48:56.188
You think you could get
my shoulders instead?

48:56.190 --> 48:57.956
I just feel so tense.

48:57.958 --> 48:59.436
- Yeah, sure.

49:09.267 --> 49:11.434
You don't feel that tense.

49:13.190 --> 49:14.958
- Let me ask you something.

49:14.960 --> 49:15.793
- Go for it.

49:17.150 --> 49:17.983
- Why Tasha?

49:20.366 --> 49:21.197
- What?

49:21.199 --> 49:23.513
- You and Tasha,
I don't get it.

49:25.830 --> 49:27.808
- Miles, it's
not like we're...

49:27.810 --> 49:30.198
- There's nothing
special about her

49:30.200 --> 49:32.633
and there's nothing that
she can do that I can't.

49:33.760 --> 49:35.156
Or better.

49:41.010 --> 49:46.010
- Miles look, there's just
nothing here between you and I.

49:47.300 --> 49:48.718
I mean...

49:48.720 --> 49:49.570
- There could be.

49:54.735 --> 49:56.188
- No, Miley,

49:56.190 --> 49:58.618
we are in two
different leagues.

49:58.620 --> 50:02.028
You need a good guy
and I am not a good guy.

50:02.030 --> 50:03.973
- Maybe I don't
want a good guy.

50:03.975 --> 50:05.525
- And I
don't want you.

50:06.805 --> 50:07.853
I'm sorry.

50:07.855 --> 50:10.643
- Fine, have fun with your
cum guzzling gutter slut!

50:14.950 --> 50:16.050
- What did you do now?

50:47.923 --> 50:50.262
- Where
the fuck am I?

50:50.264 --> 50:51.858
- Stay down.
- Who the fuck are you?

50:51.860 --> 50:54.801
- I'm Nurse
Vanessa Hemsgrove.

50:54.803 --> 50:57.440
You're at Pine Hills Camp.

50:57.442 --> 50:58.798
Ow!

50:58.800 --> 50:59.928
- Gil, give her some space.

50:59.930 --> 51:02.300
- Bitch, would
you stop hitting me?

51:03.598 --> 51:04.429
- What
did you hit me with?

51:04.431 --> 51:05.738
- A sedative.

51:05.740 --> 51:07.668
The effects have
not worn off yet.

51:07.670 --> 51:10.068
I promise, no one's
gonna hurt you.

51:10.070 --> 51:11.948
- What happened?

51:11.950 --> 51:14.278
- Bitch just went
in with a hair trigger.

51:14.280 --> 51:15.908
- Sorry.
- Jesus.

51:15.910 --> 51:18.008
- Can you
tell me your name?

51:18.010 --> 51:18.918
- Jane.

51:18.920 --> 51:19.751
- Oh, I swear to God,

51:19.753 --> 51:21.798
if you say your
last name is Doe...

51:21.800 --> 51:23.408
- Fuck off.

51:23.410 --> 51:25.263
- What are
you doing out here, Jane?

51:26.650 --> 51:28.063
- We were on vacation.

51:29.810 --> 51:31.633
My friends and
I were camping.

51:32.810 --> 51:33.853
Something,

51:35.640 --> 51:37.008
something attacked us.

51:37.010 --> 51:38.275
There's something
in the woods.

51:38.277 --> 51:39.377
- Whoa whoa whoa, sit.

51:40.660 --> 51:42.473
- What kind of something?

51:43.550 --> 51:47.686
- I don't know, some
animal, a monster.

51:47.688 --> 51:50.048
- What the hell are you
talking about, what monster?

51:50.050 --> 51:52.998
- It hunted us down.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.833
It killed my friends.

51:56.140 --> 51:56.973
It killed,

52:00.077 --> 52:01.265
Alex.

52:01.267 --> 52:03.838
- I need to know
exactly what happened,

52:03.840 --> 52:05.568
are there others out there?

52:05.570 --> 52:08.268
- They're dead,
they're all dead.

52:08.270 --> 52:11.758
- Gil, we've
gotta call somebody.

52:11.760 --> 52:13.123
Where's the sat. Phone?

52:15.380 --> 52:16.213
- Smashed.

52:17.240 --> 52:18.071
I don't know how...
- What?

52:18.073 --> 52:18.906
- It's a no go.

52:19.865 --> 52:22.423
- Oh my God,
Will, Courtney, Charlie?

52:24.560 --> 52:25.810
- Nobody's come back yet.

52:27.317 --> 52:29.317
- God, what is going on?

52:31.005 --> 52:32.922
- Hell if I know.

52:34.730 --> 52:36.093
- There are people missing.

52:37.660 --> 52:39.888
She shows up, talking
about her friends

52:39.890 --> 52:41.563
are being killed
by some monster?

52:42.546 --> 52:44.115
- I really don't think
she's the most reliable source

52:44.117 --> 52:45.817
of information
right now, Vanessa.

52:47.100 --> 52:50.208
- Even so, I have
three counselors missing

52:50.210 --> 52:53.808
and after what I've
seen the past few hours...

52:53.810 --> 52:55.368
- What are you
talking about now?

52:55.370 --> 52:57.387
- Come look at this.

53:06.769 --> 53:07.958
- The fuck is that?

53:07.960 --> 53:10.260
- I don't know, but it
came out of Jane's leg.

53:11.840 --> 53:13.113
- She's sick, contagious?

53:14.450 --> 53:15.283
- I don't know.

53:19.130 --> 53:21.598
- No bullshit, what
is that all over you?

53:21.600 --> 53:22.723
- Pick a friend.

53:24.069 --> 53:26.023
- Let's hear about
this monster of yours.

53:30.650 --> 53:31.483
- Tasha?

53:33.430 --> 53:35.263
Just go away, okay?

53:37.676 --> 53:39.715
You were right,

53:39.717 --> 53:44.603
I'm not a gazelle, I'm just
a fucking elephant.

53:47.269 --> 53:51.436
Tasha?

54:03.010 --> 54:05.148
- That's the last
thing I remember.

54:05.150 --> 54:08.968
I woke up, heard some
not-too-friendly shit in the woods,

54:08.970 --> 54:12.234
stumbled up on you
people, and here we are.

54:12.236 --> 54:16.103
- No, I call
bullshit, it's gotta be bullshit.

54:17.316 --> 54:20.098
- But you said you killed
the thing, though, right?

54:20.100 --> 54:21.678
- As far as I know.

54:21.680 --> 54:22.830
There wasn't much left.

54:24.100 --> 54:24.933
- Gil?

54:26.920 --> 54:27.751
- I'll start the car.

54:27.753 --> 54:30.093
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa, what?

54:30.967 --> 54:32.998
You don't actually believe
this horseshit, do you?

54:33.000 --> 54:34.888
- Listen, Abercrombie, you
wanna hang around here,

54:34.890 --> 54:35.778
be my guest.

54:35.780 --> 54:36.611
- What about the others,

54:36.613 --> 54:38.408
we're just gonna fuckin'
take off and leave 'em?

54:38.410 --> 54:41.838
- Mason's right, Gil, I'm not
leaving those kids out there.

54:41.840 --> 54:43.028
We gotta go find them.

54:43.030 --> 54:45.438
- So we go out there
and risk something

54:45.440 --> 54:47.208
happening to all of us?

54:47.210 --> 54:50.083
I am with Gil, I say we
hightail it the fuck outta here.

54:51.105 --> 54:52.338
- And what if it was you?

54:52.340 --> 54:54.758
- If I was stupid enough
to go out there alone,

54:54.760 --> 54:56.618
I'd expect you to spill
one for your homey

54:56.620 --> 54:58.083
and get the fuck outta dodge.

54:59.070 --> 54:59.901
- Bitch.

54:59.903 --> 55:01.898
- Hey, don't sit
there and act like

55:01.900 --> 55:05.498
you'd be all heroic for me
if I was the one out there.

55:05.500 --> 55:07.683
- You can't go out there.

55:07.685 --> 55:10.608
If there are more of those
out there, believe me,

55:10.610 --> 55:13.098
your friends are
more than likely dead.

55:13.100 --> 55:15.325
- Well, I'm
not gonna sit here

55:15.327 --> 55:17.674
and listen to this
horseshit anymore.

55:17.676 --> 55:20.108
There are no goddamn
monsters out here

55:20.110 --> 55:22.128
and I'm not gonna bolt all
because some crack whore

55:22.130 --> 55:23.938
decided she was
gonna run into camp

55:23.940 --> 55:25.498
and tell us all
about her friends

55:25.500 --> 55:27.725
that got killed
by some Gil-man.

55:29.460 --> 55:31.813
- Actually, they
were ripped apart.

55:35.180 --> 55:36.013
- Vanessa.

55:36.900 --> 55:37.733
- Gil, please.

55:39.894 --> 55:41.394
- Goddamn it,
all right, fine,

55:42.436 --> 55:44.078
Vanessa and I will
go look for the others,

55:44.080 --> 55:46.278
you guys stay here in
case they come back.

55:46.280 --> 55:49.358
- Nice try, handsome,
but I'm not staying here.

55:49.360 --> 55:52.383
- Didn't you just say it was
smarter not to go out there?

55:52.385 --> 55:54.028
And I still stand by that.

55:54.030 --> 55:56.678
However, I'd be more
comfortable with you out there

55:56.680 --> 55:57.673
than stuck here.

55:58.520 --> 55:59.888
- Where's Miley?

55:59.890 --> 56:02.118
- Last I saw her, she was
headed towards the bathhouse.

56:02.120 --> 56:03.878
- Can you please go get her?

56:03.880 --> 56:06.480
The last thing we need is
to be separated right now.

56:10.095 --> 56:11.628
I'm gonna go get
some more supplies

56:11.630 --> 56:13.968
in case anybody
else gets hurt.

56:13.970 --> 56:15.528
- I don't think a
bandaid's gonna cure

56:15.530 --> 56:17.580
what's more than
likely happened to them.

56:18.735 --> 56:20.958
- Our thoughts stay
positive, please.

56:20.960 --> 56:21.793
Stay with her.

56:23.647 --> 56:26.647
- I guess I'm gonna
get flashlights.

56:39.210 --> 56:41.210
- Sorry about the
whole crack whore jab.

58:07.147 --> 58:11.773
- Jesus, Will, where
the hell have you guys been?

58:15.126 --> 58:15.959
Will?

58:18.806 --> 58:19.639
Oh my God.

58:35.783 --> 58:40.571
Oh no, please, no!

58:48.712 --> 58:51.276
Oh my God, oh my God.

59:20.241 --> 59:22.649
Oh my God.

59:22.651 --> 59:25.568
Holy shit.

59:26.642 --> 59:31.642
Oh my God, what is
happening?

59:32.194 --> 59:36.971
- Miley.

59:36.973 --> 59:37.804
Miley?

59:37.806 --> 59:39.324
What the fuck!?

59:39.326 --> 59:40.793
Vanessa!

59:45.207 --> 59:47.558
Jesus fucking
Christ.

59:47.560 --> 59:48.608
- Yeah, he's dead.

59:48.610 --> 59:50.768
- Oh no shit, I couldn't
tell from the scissors

59:50.770 --> 59:53.728
sticking out of his
fucking head.

59:53.730 --> 59:55.267
- Whatever
happened to Will

59:56.560 --> 59:58.188
has happened to
the others out there.

59:58.190 --> 01:00:00.328
- And what, exactly, is that?

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:02.888
- Eh, yeah we're
still working on it.

01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:07.890
- It attaches itself to the host
and causes severe mutation.

01:00:08.011 --> 01:00:09.508
- Fuck.

01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:13.023
- However, without
the host being active,

01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:16.468
the parasite can't thrive.

01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:18.028
- And there's no
way to save the host?

01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:20.748
- With this severe of a
mutation, I don't think so.

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:22.790
- So what happens
to the parasite?

01:00:33.822 --> 01:00:38.822
- Whoa, they
did not like that.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.150
- Oh my God!

01:00:47.719 --> 01:00:49.136
- Get the window!

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:51.790
Hey!

01:00:53.851 --> 01:00:55.230
- What the fuck's
wrong with them?

01:00:55.232 --> 01:00:56.088
What was that?

01:00:56.090 --> 01:00:59.408
- I don't know, and at
this point, I don't care.

01:00:59.410 --> 01:01:00.463
Just help me.

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:04.073
- Gil,

01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:08.389
this isn't normal.

01:01:08.391 --> 01:01:11.428
- I don't think that
constitutes as normal, tonight.

01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:12.263
- Look at this.

01:01:14.246 --> 01:01:15.738
- What am
I looking for?

01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:19.338
- His heart, he
was still changing.

01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:21.908
It's filled with puncture
wounds and holes.

01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:24.188
Whatever that thing was

01:01:24.190 --> 01:01:27.563
was filling him full of
hormones and adrenaline.

01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:30.054
- That's what the fuck
that as throwing me around

01:01:30.056 --> 01:01:31.848
like a rag doll.

01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:33.543
- Yeah, but there's
more to it than that.

01:01:34.736 --> 01:01:36.068
- What do you mean?

01:01:36.070 --> 01:01:38.297
- Well think about
it for a second,

01:01:39.388 --> 01:01:40.858
what's the heart do?

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:41.743
Pumps blood.

01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:46.938
It was feeding oxygen
and blood into his body.

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:48.123
- Okay.
- Well,

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:51.198
what was that
thing gunning toward

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.700
when it come
out of his mouth?

01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:54.893
- Tasha?

01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:57.403
- What about me?

01:01:59.670 --> 01:02:02.643
- It also feeds blood into
certain areas of the body.

01:02:03.977 --> 01:02:05.598
- Oh.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:06.431
Okay.

01:02:06.433 --> 01:02:08.653
- Yeah, which
is how it spreads,

01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:12.168
it takes over the entire
reproductive system,

01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:13.828
pumps an excessive
amount of adrenaline,

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:14.808
hormones into the body,

01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:16.710
overpowers it's prey
and infects them.

01:02:17.708 --> 01:02:18.541
- Ew.

01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:22.118
- So what you're saying
is this thing has a source,

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.140
like a patient zero?

01:02:24.436 --> 01:02:26.266
- I don't know.

01:02:26.268 --> 01:02:28.064
That's about all
I got at this point.

01:02:28.066 --> 01:02:29.514
- Shh.

01:02:29.516 --> 01:02:30.349
Listen.

01:03:15.835 --> 01:03:16.668
Bowman!

01:03:17.686 --> 01:03:19.703
Fuck, I gotta go
get him.

01:03:19.705 --> 01:03:21.564
- You can't go out there.

01:03:21.566 --> 01:03:23.463
- Not gonna let
him fuckin' die.

01:03:57.365 --> 01:04:01.243
- This outta put you
away for a couple years.

01:04:01.245 --> 01:04:03.704
- Eh, just be safe.

01:04:03.706 --> 01:04:05.704
- Yeah, there's

01:04:17.327 --> 01:04:18.158
Whoa, whoa whoa whoa whoa.

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.548
- Get your hands up, Gil.

01:04:19.550 --> 01:04:20.558
- Bowman, calm down.

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:23.108
- Get your hands up,
you fucking convict.

01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:25.248
- Bowman, you gotta
listen to me, man,

01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:28.318
calm down, there's some
fucked up shit happening tonight...

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:29.423
- I don't wanna hear it.

01:04:30.388 --> 01:04:31.765
- What the fuck
are you doing?

01:04:31.767 --> 01:04:32.858
You're fucking
planting evidence?

01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:33.948
- I don't wanna
fucking hear it.

01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:36.205
I figure some asshole
like you got it coming,

01:04:36.207 --> 01:04:37.195
you never fucking learn.

01:04:37.197 --> 01:04:39.108
Now get your
fuckin' ass over here,

01:04:39.110 --> 01:04:40.508
put your hands
on the table now.

01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:41.678
- Don't have time for this...

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:43.218
- Put your goddamn
hands on the table, Gil!

01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:44.998
- Shit has went down...
- Put your goddamn,

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.746
fucking hands on the fucking
table, you son of a bitch.

01:04:50.215 --> 01:04:51.671
Fuck huh?

01:04:51.673 --> 01:04:53.578
Your fucking
mouth, goddamn it.

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:55.358
I've had enough
of your shit, Gil.

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:56.844
- You're making a
fucking mistake, man...

01:04:56.846 --> 01:04:57.748
- Keep walking to
the door, asshole,

01:04:57.750 --> 01:05:01.203
walk to the fucking door.
- Goddamn it.

01:05:05.306 --> 01:05:07.558
- Fucking dip-shit,
Mayberry ass, mother fucker.

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:10.728
- Shut your fucking
pie hole, keep walking.

01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:13.938
- Oh no, why is
he taking him?

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:16.077
- Uh, we have to go explain.

01:05:19.077 --> 01:05:21.011
- How do you
feel now, tough guy, huh...

01:05:21.013 --> 01:05:22.438
- Fuck you, Bowman.

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:23.628
- Piece of shit.

01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:25.830
- Just fuckin'...
- Shut your fuckin' mouth!

01:05:31.498 --> 01:05:33.588
- Oh, you are so
making a fucking mistake.

01:05:33.590 --> 01:05:34.588
- Oh, am I really?

01:05:34.590 --> 01:05:36.388
Am I really making a mistake?

01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:37.221
Huh?

01:05:37.223 --> 01:05:38.157
You're going to jail, creep.

01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:42.057
Huh, you wanna fuck
around, you've gotta...

01:05:42.059 --> 01:05:42.890
- Stop, it's not...

01:05:42.892 --> 01:05:45.763
- Everybody calm the
fuck down, goddamn it.

01:05:49.291 --> 01:05:50.797
- Do you know
what's happening right now?

01:05:50.799 --> 01:05:52.831
- What's
happening right now?

01:05:52.833 --> 01:05:56.190
Shut the fuck up.

01:05:56.192 --> 01:05:57.814
- The fuck?
- Oh shit.

01:06:20.450 --> 01:06:21.283
- Oh fuck!

01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:26.318
- Let me in!

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.077
You spineless prick!

01:07:00.034 --> 01:07:00.865
- Are you okay?

01:07:00.867 --> 01:07:02.192
- Keys keys keys!

01:07:14.163 --> 01:07:15.933
Go go go go go go, go go go.

01:07:41.034 --> 01:07:42.083
- What are they doing?

01:07:42.085 --> 01:07:42.916
Why did they stop?

01:07:42.918 --> 01:07:44.264
- I don't know.

01:07:44.266 --> 01:07:45.099
- Shit.

01:07:45.986 --> 01:07:47.438
- Damn it.

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.083
- They were everywhere.

01:07:53.225 --> 01:07:54.866
- Five years in the pen,

01:07:54.868 --> 01:07:57.198
the closest thing to
getting laid I'm gonna get

01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.298
is tongue fucked to death
these goddamn things.

01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:01.168
- Hey, my offer still stands,

01:08:01.170 --> 01:08:02.628
but if you get us
out of here alive,

01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:04.130
I'm throwing
anal in the deal.

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.654
- Goddamn killer sex sauce!

01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:35.227
Shit!

01:08:44.109 --> 01:08:44.939
Oh come on.

01:08:44.942 --> 01:08:47.008
Oh shit!

01:08:47.010 --> 01:08:49.325
Oh.

01:09:32.693 --> 01:09:35.872
Hey hey, come
on, kid, wake up.

01:09:35.874 --> 01:09:36.890
Come on.

01:09:36.892 --> 01:09:38.059
- Fuck.

01:09:39.133 --> 01:09:42.823
- Oh fuck.

01:09:44.674 --> 01:09:46.127
You okay?

01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:46.962
- Yeah.

01:09:48.285 --> 01:09:51.234
I think I, I told you something
was way fuckin' bad, still.

01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:55.463
- Duly noted.

01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:06.208
It's after Tash, we've
gotta go after it.

01:10:06.210 --> 01:10:08.254
- How do you even
know she's still alive?

01:10:11.107 --> 01:10:15.345
- Call it a hunch.

01:10:15.347 --> 01:10:18.347
- Is there anything
useful in there?

01:10:19.307 --> 01:10:24.307
- We'll
see.

01:10:27.507 --> 01:10:28.675
That work?

01:10:28.677 --> 01:10:29.510
- Yeah.

01:10:30.587 --> 01:10:32.395
Vacation's over.

01:10:32.397 --> 01:10:34.486
Time to get to work.

01:10:49.355 --> 01:10:53.633
- Hey whoa whoa whoa.

01:10:53.635 --> 01:10:55.635
- What the fuck is that?

01:11:00.325 --> 01:11:01.158
Hold this.

01:11:16.253 --> 01:11:18.091
- They're coming.

01:11:24.012 --> 01:11:29.012
- Fuck, Jesus fucking
Christ.

01:11:32.518 --> 01:11:34.484
No, stop.

01:11:34.486 --> 01:11:37.132
Let me go.

01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:41.120
- Is anal still worth it?

01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:44.423
- Yeah.

01:11:46.435 --> 01:11:47.503
- Pussy.

01:12:13.994 --> 01:12:16.112
- Hey, what's that?

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:26.410
- That's dynamite.

01:12:30.546 --> 01:12:34.042
- It's better
than a wrench.

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:00.678
What the fuck?

01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:19.913
Jane.

01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:23.407
She's still breathing.

01:13:36.484 --> 01:13:37.458
What the fuck is going on?

01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:39.148
What's wrong with her?

01:13:39.150 --> 01:13:40.341
Who is that?

01:13:40.343 --> 01:13:42.472
What's with the
bitch on the wall?

01:13:42.474 --> 01:13:43.557
- That's Meg.

01:13:45.874 --> 01:13:50.761
And this is Alex.

01:13:50.763 --> 01:13:52.248
She is,

01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:56.500
was my girlfriend.

01:13:57.884 --> 01:14:01.985
Alex, come on,
wake up, please don't go.

01:14:01.987 --> 01:14:04.694
Please don't
leave me.

01:14:07.996 --> 01:14:10.844
Alex, come on.

01:14:10.846 --> 01:14:11.679
Come on!

01:14:14.406 --> 01:14:19.406
We just wanted to get
away for the weekend.

01:14:20.006 --> 01:14:25.006
Please don't, I'm sorry.

01:14:26.987 --> 01:14:27.904
I love you.

01:14:42.267 --> 01:14:47.267
- Whoa.

01:16:20.586 --> 01:16:22.419
- Gil, come on.

01:17:42.532 --> 01:17:46.250
- Tash.

01:18:08.287 --> 01:18:10.120
Come on, come on, kid.

01:19:54.164 --> 01:19:54.997
Fuck.

01:21:27.908 --> 01:21:31.175
- Uh, 53E, take one.

01:21:36.590 --> 01:21:38.008
- Let's
take one again,

01:21:38.010 --> 01:21:41.193
you have the right to
remain without clothes.

01:21:42.610 --> 01:21:43.768
Well fuck, there
goes the wig.

01:21:46.141 --> 01:21:46.974
- 500,000.

01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:49.710
- Actually,
reset from the top.

01:21:51.269 --> 01:21:54.278
- Goddamn, you're
ruining my boner, T.J.

01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:55.818
- Hold on,

01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:57.358
I wanna rest on this for
just a little bit longer, okay?

01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:59.048
- He's going
limp, dude, come on.

01:21:59.050 --> 01:21:59.883
- Action.

01:22:07.870 --> 01:22:09.688
- That's what
you get, that's Karma.

01:22:09.690 --> 01:22:10.838
- I went to
slam into the door

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:12.489
and I just wasn't...

01:22:15.171 --> 01:22:17.268
- Good thing you didn't
have, like, those scissors.

01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:19.668
- Yeah, don't
run with scissors.

01:22:19.670 --> 01:22:22.231
- Can he stay
there and we use that?

01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:29.138
- You like this
mullet, yeah you do.

01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:31.631
Oh.

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:37.588
- Shit, Jesus,
Gil are you okay?

01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:40.328
- Oh fucking bitch,
got my leg

01:22:40.330 --> 01:22:41.161
- Who is that?

01:22:41.163 --> 01:22:42.506
- Is your
dick out of place?

01:22:42.508 --> 01:22:46.005
- Oh my God.

01:22:47.432 --> 01:22:49.918
That was my line.

01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:52.823
- Someone as knowledgeable
and handy as you are,

01:22:53.969 --> 01:22:56.538
I'm sure you know exactly
what to do with those hands.

01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:57.958
Don't you?

01:23:01.170 --> 01:23:03.687
That was,

01:23:09.890 --> 01:23:11.358
- Blew your
load a little early, didn't ya?

01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:13.282
- Yeah.

01:23:20.583 --> 01:23:21.916
- Oh shit!

01:23:23.215 --> 01:23:26.208
- Gil,
are you okay?

01:23:26.210 --> 01:23:27.721
- Charlie's got mahogany.

01:23:27.723 --> 01:23:31.682
- Dude,
it was like 10 seconds.

01:23:31.684 --> 01:23:34.861
- Can't help
it, it's human nature.

01:23:41.292 --> 01:23:42.329
- I couldn't get it.

01:23:42.331 --> 01:23:46.420
I'm trying.

01:23:46.422 --> 01:23:50.790
Let me in!

01:23:55.611 --> 01:23:59.605
- It flew right in
my eye.

01:23:59.607 --> 01:24:02.418
- Now Charlie, don't
be a sore loser, Charlie.

01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:03.253
- Sorry Charlie.

01:24:04.763 --> 01:24:05.596
That hurt.

01:24:10.611 --> 01:24:15.361
- Was
that good for you?

01:24:16.671 --> 01:24:17.712
My butt hole hurts.

01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:02.513
- Where are they?

01:27:05.150 --> 01:27:05.983
- Jane?
