WEBVTT

00:04.837 --> 00:05.905
- Hey Tom.
We all miss you in band.

00:06.005 --> 00:07.674
- You miss me?
- Yeah.

00:07.740 --> 00:09.709
- That's literally the nicest
thing anyone's ever said to me.

00:09.809 --> 00:11.811
- That's the nicest?
- It's top three.

00:11.878 --> 00:13.913
- That's so sad--you know what?
- Well...

00:14.013 --> 00:15.915
- You should come to
my birthday party this weekend.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.684
- Great, yeah, count me in.
Thank you for the invite.

00:17.750 --> 00:19.252
- Technically, I'm not allowed
to invite you,

00:19.352 --> 00:20.987
but you should come.
- What does that mean?

00:21.054 --> 00:23.489
- 'Cause, you know,
you're more of a secret friend.

00:23.556 --> 00:25.925
- Whoa, that's confusing.
- Secret friend? Why secret?

00:26.025 --> 00:28.761
- My mom said I'm not allowed
to interact with "your kind."

00:28.861 --> 00:30.196
It's not a big deal.

00:30.263 --> 00:32.231
- Sounds like a big deal.
- Here's my solution.

00:32.331 --> 00:34.434
Tell my mom that
you're the caterer's son.

00:34.534 --> 00:35.868
- Caterer's son?
- Yeah.

00:35.935 --> 00:37.603
- I'm confused.
I am invited, or I'm not?

00:37.704 --> 00:40.606
- No, you're definitely not
invited, but I want you there.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.341
- What's the dress code?
Just casual?

00:42.408 --> 00:45.945
- I'd say whatever you think
a caterer's son would wear.

00:47.113 --> 00:50.516
- All right, here goes nothing.
Whoa, nice party.

00:50.583 --> 00:51.951
- Wait, wait.
- Woah, what's happening?

00:52.051 --> 00:54.053
- Tom? Did we invite you?

00:54.120 --> 00:56.622
- Oh, no, I'm not part
of the party.

00:56.723 --> 00:57.790
My dad is the caterer.

00:57.890 --> 00:59.692
- Kevork is your father?

00:59.759 --> 01:01.961
- Kevork is my primary father.

01:02.061 --> 01:03.296
- I thought I heard a rumor

01:03.396 --> 01:04.931
that your dad
was in Myrtle Beach.

01:05.031 --> 01:06.365
- He was.
He's back.

01:06.432 --> 01:09.368
And he started
a Lebanese catering company.

01:09.435 --> 01:11.370
- Are you all Lebanese?
- We're not.

01:11.437 --> 01:14.273
He just thought it was
a fun theme, a fun motif.

01:14.373 --> 01:15.541
Anyway, I'm gonna
let myself in.

01:15.608 --> 01:17.210
All right.
Hey, what up, Dad?

01:17.276 --> 01:18.377
- Oh, my God.

01:18.444 --> 01:21.647
- Wow.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.984
I had no idea that
this guy was so much fun!

01:25.084 --> 01:26.552
- Yeah, his name's Tom.

01:26.619 --> 01:28.588
We're in band together.
We were, I mean.

01:28.654 --> 01:29.789
- Hey, you guys wanna
see a backflip?

01:29.889 --> 01:31.124
- Yeah, Tom!
Do it!

01:31.224 --> 01:32.492
- You wanna see a backflip,
Dakota?

01:32.592 --> 01:33.993
- I mean, not as much
as she does.

01:34.093 --> 01:35.328
- Do it, do it right now.
Do it.

01:35.428 --> 01:38.131
- Do it, Tom!
Show us a backflip!

01:38.231 --> 01:40.633
- All right, here--
- Oh, my God.

01:40.733 --> 01:42.602
-
What's happening?

01:42.668 --> 01:44.504
- Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

01:44.604 --> 01:45.972
- Who is this guy?

01:46.072 --> 01:48.174
- What's up?
- We have a problem, Tom.

01:48.274 --> 01:49.909
- Problem?
- Some jewelry

01:49.976 --> 01:51.077
has gone missing,
and your father

01:51.144 --> 01:52.845
is the one who took it.

01:52.945 --> 01:55.615
- My father? Kevork?
- He stole.

01:55.681 --> 01:57.316
And now we'd like you
to confront him.

01:57.416 --> 01:59.018
So we don't have
to make a scene here.

01:59.118 --> 02:00.653
- Oh, no, he doesn't like
to be bothered in the kitchen.

02:00.753 --> 02:02.255
- Thomas, when adults
talk to you,

02:02.321 --> 02:05.358
you need to be respectful.
- Bradley, shut up.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.859
We're gonna listen
from the hall,

02:06.959 --> 02:09.529
and if he gets defensive,
we'll come in.

02:09.629 --> 02:11.964
- Oh, no.
- The safe word

02:12.031 --> 02:15.168
is bouillabaisse.
- Bouillabaisse?

02:15.268 --> 02:17.436
How about something easier
like cookie or ham?

02:17.503 --> 02:19.806
- No, we spent a lot on
this party, for Christ's sake.

02:19.872 --> 02:22.875
I wanna have
a very classy safe word.

02:24.343 --> 02:25.878
Now, don't screw it up.
- Oh.

02:25.978 --> 02:29.048
-
- Okay, Pops, we need to talk.

02:29.148 --> 02:31.384
- Who are you, and why
are you calling me Pops?

02:31.484 --> 02:32.785
- I'm the son.
- Whose son?

02:32.852 --> 02:34.620
- It's your son, Tom.
- No, no, no, no.

02:34.687 --> 02:35.888
I don't have Tom.

02:35.988 --> 02:37.890
- That's no way to talk
to your main boy.

02:37.990 --> 02:40.359
- Main boy?
I don't even know you.

02:40.459 --> 02:42.862
- He won't even acknowledge him
as his own son.

02:42.962 --> 02:44.363
- It is not right.

02:44.463 --> 02:46.365
- That's what I just said
if you had been listening.

02:46.465 --> 02:49.202
- Listen, if you stole
something, just put it back.

02:49.302 --> 02:51.237
- Wait, wait.
You accusing me of stealing?

02:51.337 --> 02:53.072
- Listen, as a family member,
I'm trying to help.

02:53.172 --> 02:55.041
- You know how you can help?
You can go over there

02:55.141 --> 02:58.077
to that corner over there
and pull your little pants down

02:58.177 --> 03:00.079
and smack your little tush
with a spatula.

03:00.179 --> 03:01.714
-
Bouillabaisse!

03:01.814 --> 03:03.583
Ham!
Bouillabaisse, ham!

03:03.683 --> 03:06.052
- This job is beneath me!
You kids are obnoxious.

03:06.152 --> 03:08.087
You know, why don't you
cook your own food, all right?

03:08.187 --> 03:09.755
Your BLT or whatever
you Americans do, your--

03:09.856 --> 03:10.923
- Pops...

03:11.023 --> 03:12.825
- Organic soybeans
and oat milk.

03:12.892 --> 03:14.594
- Dad, so you're not
returning the watch?

03:14.694 --> 03:17.096
- I have not taken a watch!
- Wow.

03:17.196 --> 03:18.664
This is not good at all.

03:18.731 --> 03:22.401
- Thanks for nothing, folks.
Keep your filthy money.

03:22.501 --> 03:24.770
- Tom, aren't you leaving
with your father?

03:24.871 --> 03:26.572
- Oh that's right.
Oh, wait, wait up, Pops!

03:26.672 --> 03:28.074
- Suck a donkey's
ding dong, kid.

03:28.174 --> 03:29.175
- Donkey's ding dong what?

03:29.242 --> 03:30.676
- What a monster!

03:30.743 --> 03:32.912
- All right,
I'll see you at home.

03:33.012 --> 03:35.448
- Did your father just leave
without you?

03:35.548 --> 03:37.283
- I think he did.
That's upsetting.

03:37.383 --> 03:39.285
- Tom, come here.
I just feel terrible

03:39.385 --> 03:40.586
for misjudging you
all of these years.

03:40.686 --> 03:41.854
- Thank you.

03:41.921 --> 03:43.623
- I thought you were
a little strange,

03:43.723 --> 03:46.259
but it's not your fault at all.
Because you know what?

03:46.359 --> 03:48.427
You have an abusive situation
at your home.

03:48.527 --> 03:49.896
- It explains a lot.

03:49.962 --> 03:51.898
- You just need a male
role model in your life

03:51.964 --> 03:53.966
because you don't
really have one.

03:54.066 --> 03:56.402
- No one supports me.
I'm a good guy.

03:56.469 --> 03:58.905
- Oh! Tom should go
on Dad's fishing trip with him!

03:58.971 --> 04:00.306
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

04:00.406 --> 04:02.308
- Oh, my God,
that's a great idea, Brad.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.977
- No, it's a terrible idea.
- It's a great idea.

04:05.077 --> 04:07.280
- He wouldn't even like that.
What kids like fishing?

04:07.380 --> 04:08.814
- Honestly, it sounds
like the trip of a lifetime.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.216
- You need to bring him along.

04:10.283 --> 04:12.118
- If he gets hurt,
then we're liable.

04:12.218 --> 04:14.820
If--if he kills someone,
we're liable--

04:14.921 --> 04:16.122
- Great, it's decided.

04:16.222 --> 04:17.957
I'm gonna clear it
with Tom's mom.

04:18.057 --> 04:20.426
Plus, Brad, your friends
all teach at his school.

04:20.493 --> 04:22.595
- Can I just say one thing?
- No.

04:22.662 --> 04:24.130
- One thing, I just want to--
- Brad,

04:24.230 --> 04:26.899
I don't wanna hear it.
-

04:26.966 --> 04:28.768
- Hey, Tom.
Tom's mom.

04:28.834 --> 04:30.169
- Hi, Dakota's dad.

04:30.269 --> 04:31.771
Thanks so much
for including Tom!

04:31.837 --> 04:33.773
He's excited.
- It was my wife's idea.

04:33.839 --> 04:36.742
You know,
he doesn't have to go even.

04:36.809 --> 04:38.110
- Oh no, I'm looking
forward to it.

04:38.177 --> 04:39.745
Can't wait.
- Do you have

04:39.812 --> 04:43.349
any questions or concerns?
I mean, there's gonna be

04:43.449 --> 04:46.118
a lot of drinking--
hard alcohol and whatnot.

04:46.185 --> 04:47.653
- No.
- He'll be exposed to

04:47.753 --> 04:50.523
rough language
and open sewage and...

04:50.623 --> 04:52.858
- Zero--is there a number
I can reach you at?

04:52.959 --> 04:56.529
- Ooh, unfortunately, there's
no cell service up there.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.331
We'll be completely
off the grid.

04:58.431 --> 04:59.598
- Mm, well...

04:59.665 --> 05:00.967
sometimes you gotta
let your kid

05:01.033 --> 05:02.268
off the grid, right, Tom?

05:02.335 --> 05:03.536
- What?
- I don't get the house

05:03.636 --> 05:05.671
to myself a ton,
so I'm excited.

05:05.771 --> 05:07.373
- All right,
it's your child's funeral.

05:07.473 --> 05:08.541
Tom, just get in the car, then,

05:08.641 --> 05:10.776
if you're so hellbent on going.

05:10.843 --> 05:12.511
We're running late, so...

05:12.611 --> 05:16.382
<i>- ♪ Give yourself
another chance, my darling ♪</i>

05:16.482 --> 05:19.719
<i>♪ Don't be satisfied
with second best ♪</i>

05:21.821 --> 05:24.123
- Tom's in the house.
- Ah, what the shit.

05:24.190 --> 05:26.692
- Sorry, guys, Tom's
joining us this year.

05:26.792 --> 05:28.861
- Doesn't this ruin
the whole trip?

05:28.961 --> 05:30.563
- Not the warmest welcome.
- It sucks.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.198
I tried to stop it.

05:32.298 --> 05:33.733
- Anyway,
let's get started here.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.634
I need to just borrow
some fishing equipment,

05:35.701 --> 05:37.636
and boots,
and a hat, and a pole.

05:37.703 --> 05:39.839
- Tom, no one's
doing any fishing.

05:39.905 --> 05:42.508
I mean, this is mostly
about booze and grab-ass.

05:42.575 --> 05:44.043
- Brad, please!

05:44.143 --> 05:45.578
- Your wife didn't mention
any of that.

05:45.678 --> 05:47.480
- Yeah, well, she's on
a need-to-know basis.

05:47.546 --> 05:50.583
And Tom, on this trip
you can call me "Double D."

05:50.683 --> 05:52.018
- Oh, for "Dakota's Dad"?
- Sure.

05:52.084 --> 05:54.320
It's not because
I like big boobs.

05:54.387 --> 05:56.389
- Big boobs, what does that
have to do with Double D?

05:56.489 --> 05:59.225
- Tom, what you are about
to witness this weekend

05:59.325 --> 06:02.228
stays in the group,
never to be discussed

06:02.328 --> 06:05.765
outside of this inner sanctum
of masculinity.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.566
- I feel like the trip's
taking a weird turn.

06:07.666 --> 06:11.370
- It's called Bro Code,
because guys don't rat on guys.

06:11.437 --> 06:14.507
Now let's make a pact
by urinating in a circle.

06:14.573 --> 06:15.775
- What?
- Oh, no.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.209
- Come on, man.
- No.

06:17.276 --> 06:19.178
- Whip 'em out, guys.

06:19.245 --> 06:21.347
Who's in the mood
for some tunes?

06:21.414 --> 06:23.282
- Yeah, I guess.
- I guess so.

06:23.382 --> 06:24.717
- This is a little song I wrote

06:24.784 --> 06:27.219
called "My Wife
Just Doesn't Get It."

06:27.286 --> 06:29.855
- Here we go.
- ♪ My wife ♪

06:29.922 --> 06:31.791
♪ Just doesn't get it ♪

06:31.891 --> 06:34.360
♪ A pain inside my butt, yeah ♪

06:34.427 --> 06:36.395
♪ Her mouth will never shut,
no, no ♪

06:36.462 --> 06:38.097
- Weird subject matter, but--

06:38.197 --> 06:40.633
- He's got nine other songs
about his wife; it's crazy.

06:40.733 --> 06:44.070
- Hey, Tom, I don't want you
to let how you see me here

06:44.136 --> 06:46.605
affect the way you view me
as a principal.

06:46.705 --> 06:48.774
- Oh, no, it's Bro Code.
This all stays here.

06:48.874 --> 06:52.078
- And, look, he's the one
doing all the nasty stuff.

06:52.144 --> 06:55.081
We just come here to relax
and have a few beers.

06:55.147 --> 06:56.949
- Yeah, he seems like he's
working through some issues.

06:57.049 --> 06:59.485
- Come on, T, sing along!
- All right, Brad, please stop.

06:59.585 --> 07:00.820
You're giving me
a headache.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.988
- Oh, whatever.
Eff this thing.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.157
No one appreciates
my music anyway.

07:05.257 --> 07:06.625
- Wow.

07:06.725 --> 07:08.661
- All right, come on,
calm down, it's not the--

07:08.761 --> 07:11.130
- We need to take this party
up a notch, huh?

07:11.230 --> 07:16.001
I refuse to let a certain
someone ruin my big weekend.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.436
- He's talking about me
or his wife?

07:17.503 --> 07:18.938
- Tom, do me a favor, bro.

07:19.004 --> 07:22.241
I need your little feet
to run up there.

07:22.308 --> 07:24.243
Grab me some booze,

07:24.310 --> 07:27.746
Cool Ranch Doritos,
and a couple rubbers.

07:27.813 --> 07:29.415
- Brad, come on.
- He's a big kid.

07:29.482 --> 07:31.150
He knows what's what,
right, T?-

07:31.250 --> 07:33.152
- What are they?
What am I looking for?

07:33.252 --> 07:35.855
- They're like, um, they're
like sweaters for your penis.

07:35.955 --> 07:38.023
It does--it really does
get chilly up here.

07:38.124 --> 07:41.193
- All right,
let me go grab 'em.

07:41.293 --> 07:44.029
- Hey, while we wait,
can one of you idiots

07:44.130 --> 07:45.831
jump in the lake
and get my guitar?

07:45.931 --> 07:48.000
I need to go drop a deuce.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.303
- Why are we still friends
with him?

07:51.370 --> 07:53.506
- I don't--you know what,
I think that all the time.

07:53.606 --> 07:55.341
I don't know why.

07:55.441 --> 07:57.643
- Booze, Doritos,
penis sweaters.

07:57.710 --> 07:58.878
All right, good to go.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.779
- Um, hello?
Am I in the right place?

08:00.846 --> 08:02.148
I'm looking for DD.
- Oh!

08:02.214 --> 08:04.483
Oh, Dakota's Dad.
He's down by the lake

08:04.550 --> 08:05.651
singing a song about his wife.

08:05.718 --> 08:07.453
- Ugh, figures.

08:07.520 --> 08:10.289
- What are you doing?
Can you stand?

08:10.356 --> 08:11.824
- You're adorable.

08:11.891 --> 08:13.993
- I gotta get back
with the booze, but--oh, no--

08:14.059 --> 08:15.561
Oh, no, don't lay down.
What are you doing?

08:15.661 --> 08:17.530
- I'm just exhausted.
It's just a factory.

08:17.630 --> 08:19.965
It's always, Rhonda, blow this,
Rhonda, yank that.

08:20.032 --> 08:21.534
- Okay, off the couch.
I have to go; I'm busy.

08:21.634 --> 08:24.303
- Twelve dongs a day,
that's too many dongs!

08:24.370 --> 08:25.738
- It sounds
like a very rough job,

08:25.838 --> 08:27.406
but I don't have time to chat.

08:27.506 --> 08:29.408
- Should be three dongs a day.
- Please stop saying dong.

08:29.508 --> 08:31.644
This trip is much filthier
than I was expecting.

08:31.710 --> 08:33.145
- Hey, hey, hey, hey,
look at me.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.080
- Yeah?
- Let's do something wholesome.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.316
- Sounds weird, but what
do you want to do?

08:37.383 --> 08:39.051
- Let's make s'mores.

08:39.151 --> 08:41.220
- That's the first good idea
I've heard.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.354
That sounds great.

08:42.421 --> 08:44.356
- I know!
Let's divvy up the work.

08:44.423 --> 08:47.226
You make the s'mores
and get the fire going.

08:47.326 --> 08:49.428
I'm just gonna crash
on the couch.

08:49.528 --> 08:52.398
- That's divvying up,
or that's me doing it all?

08:54.900 --> 08:56.669
- This one is called

08:56.735 --> 09:00.339
"Why Does My Wife Insist on
Belittling Me in Public?"

09:00.406 --> 09:03.008
- You need to work on a couple
of these song titles.

09:03.075 --> 09:05.110
- ♪ Why ♪

09:05.211 --> 09:07.880
♪ Does my wife ♪

09:07.947 --> 09:11.250
♪ Insist on belittling me ♪

09:11.350 --> 09:13.452
♪ In front of our friends ♪

09:13.552 --> 09:16.589
- How many times are you
gonna say "wife" in a song?

09:16.689 --> 09:19.124
- She's not singing songs
about him, I guarantee it.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.961
- ♪ In a public place,
I'm a big disgrace ♪

09:24.196 --> 09:25.965
- Rhonda, the fire's
not starting.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.399
Rhonda, can you wake up?

09:27.466 --> 09:28.968
The lighter fluid says
keep away from children.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.302
Can you just give it
a quick squirt?

09:31.971 --> 09:34.640
- I have to do everything
on this trip.

09:34.740 --> 09:35.975
Oh, no!
Oh, no.

09:36.075 --> 09:37.977
Rhonda, please.
Flames.

09:38.077 --> 09:40.980
Come on, for God's sake.
How tired can you possibly be?

09:42.147 --> 09:43.916
Don't panic, Tom.
How do you work this thing?

09:45.384 --> 09:46.952
- Brad?
- Oh, 911?

09:47.052 --> 09:49.455
- I thought cell phones
didn't work up there.

09:49.555 --> 09:50.990
- Dakota's mom?
- Tom?

09:51.090 --> 09:52.758
- The cabin's kind of on fire.

09:52.825 --> 09:54.126
- Thomas, what are
you talking about?

09:54.226 --> 09:55.761
- The lady friend's purse
is on fire.

09:55.828 --> 09:57.496
<i>- Oh, my God, Thomas,
slow down.</i>

09:57.596 --> 09:59.231
<i>Where are you?</i>
- I can't tell you where I am.

09:59.298 --> 10:00.666
- Where's my husband?

10:00.766 --> 10:02.167
<i>- Unfortunately,
I can't divulge that.</i>

10:02.268 --> 10:04.003
- What does that even mean?
- It's a code.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.738
We pissed in a circle.
<i>- What?</i>

10:05.804 --> 10:06.905
- Oh, my God,
we're going to burn down.

10:06.972 --> 10:08.507
I've already said too much.

10:08.607 --> 10:10.843
- I'm getting in the car.
I'll be there in 40 minutes.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.478
- Don't come.
<i>- Oh, my God,</i>

10:12.578 --> 10:14.780
<i>I can't find my car keys.</i>
- Goodbye.

10:14.847 --> 10:16.749
Rhonda, no job
is that exhausting.

10:16.815 --> 10:19.952
- Okay, folks, fire's out.

10:20.019 --> 10:21.520
Looks like it started
in the fireplace,

10:21.620 --> 10:23.656
then some pervert for
some reason had a shitload

10:23.756 --> 10:25.991
of rubbers in the pantry.
Those lit up like tinder.

10:26.091 --> 10:27.993
You know, those are good
for fucking, bad for fires.

10:28.093 --> 10:29.695
Just a little fire tip
there for you.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.463
Okay, you folks be safe now.

10:31.530 --> 10:32.998
- All right, I want the truth.

10:33.098 --> 10:35.134
What exactly happened here?

10:35.200 --> 10:37.636
- You know, just hanging out.
Fishing.

10:37.703 --> 10:39.505
- Yeah, I caught a bass.

10:39.605 --> 10:41.874
- Oh, my God,
you guys are useless.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.643
Tom.
- Me?

10:44.710 --> 10:46.879
- I need to know
what exactly happened.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.547
- Uh, well, from what I know...

10:48.647 --> 10:51.850
the guys were fishing
and singing some fun songs.

10:51.950 --> 10:53.786
- Yeah?
- And Rhonda took a nap--

10:53.852 --> 10:55.120
- Who the hell is Rhonda?

10:55.187 --> 10:57.489
- She's with my dad's
catering company.

10:57.556 --> 10:59.625
- What's up?
- She's in charge of the meat.

10:59.692 --> 11:01.226
Is that a job
at a catering company?

11:01.327 --> 11:02.961
- You know what?
I'm tired of this.

11:03.028 --> 11:04.730
Tom, you're back on my list.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.298
- Back on the list?
No.

11:06.365 --> 11:10.235
- And, Bradley,
you're driving yourself home.

11:15.874 --> 11:18.744
- Hey, I'm proud of you, Tom.
- Thank you, Double D.

11:18.844 --> 11:22.147
- Being a man isn't
about fishing or camaraderie.

11:22.214 --> 11:25.250
It's about lying.
And you seem like a natural.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.653
- Thank you, Double D.
- When you're old enough,

11:27.720 --> 11:29.321
you should join us on the trip.

11:29.388 --> 11:30.989
- I think I got my fill.
- I'm with Tom.

11:31.056 --> 11:32.591
I'll just go ahead
and pass too.

11:32.691 --> 11:34.426
You can count me out.
- Yeah, we've been meaning

11:34.526 --> 11:36.362
to say something for,
like, ten years now.

11:36.428 --> 11:39.098
We--we really don't
like you, Brad.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.900
- Wow.
That's a lot to take in.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.370
Reminds me of a song
I've been working on actually.

11:44.436 --> 11:46.004
