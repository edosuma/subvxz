00:01.468 --> 00:02.802
<i>Previously, on "Being Mary Jane..."</i>

00:02.869 --> 00:05.672
My brother's showing me
a listing tomorrow afternoon.

00:05.739 --> 00:08.208
We're not actually having
this conversation now.

00:08.475 --> 00:10.977
Way too early for us
to be even thinking about this.

00:11.044 --> 00:12.312
Well, you haven't met my kids.

00:12.846 --> 00:13.913
Exactly.

00:13.980 --> 00:16.816
Your mom wanted me to make sure
you got in OK. How's everything?

00:16.883 --> 00:18.618
I'm not Ava. I'm Christie.

00:18.985 --> 00:20.320
This is Ava.

00:21.788 --> 00:23.256
- Hey, Paul.
- Hi.

00:23.623 --> 00:26.426
Mom didn't tell me
my new babysitter would be so cute.

00:27.026 --> 00:29.295
- Tell me what you want.
- Tell me you love me.

00:29.863 --> 00:30.864
I love you.

00:31.131 --> 00:32.732
I love you too.

00:32.799 --> 00:33.867
Judge McAlister,

00:33.933 --> 00:36.936
I'm sure you've been approached
by every journalist here tonight.

00:37.003 --> 00:39.439
Then you're aware of my reservations
about interviews.

00:39.506 --> 00:40.573
I am aware.

00:40.640 --> 00:44.144
Now, "Great Day USA"
is friendly and relatable.

00:44.210 --> 00:47.313
It's the perfect chance for the public
to meet the man behind the robe.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.048
<i>So when it comes down to it,</i>

00:49.315 --> 00:50.417
<i>when I look at you,</i>

00:52.051 --> 00:53.620
<i>I see an ugly black woman too.</i>

00:54.421 --> 00:57.457
That's an ambush.
I mean, we're still race baiting.

00:57.757 --> 01:01.094
I think your demeanor is cold.
It's judgmental. It's haughty.

01:01.961 --> 01:05.064
I don't think that's what our viewers
want with their morning coffee.

01:05.331 --> 01:07.901
Look, Mary Jane, we all know
you have charisma and charm,

01:07.967 --> 01:09.702
and that works for the lighter pieces.

01:09.769 --> 01:12.906
It's the serious interviews,
I just don't think they're for you.

01:30.790 --> 01:33.059
<i>- Harvard or Yale?
- Harvard Law, 1976.</i>

01:33.126 --> 01:35.328
<i>- Birthplace?
- Glassboro, North Carolina.</i>

01:35.395 --> 01:38.097
<i>- And the name of his...?
- Mother. Diane, school teacher.</i>

01:38.164 --> 01:40.967
<i>His father, Raymond,
owned a chain of supermarkets.</i>

01:41.034 --> 01:42.769
<i>- And the oldest son?
- Make it bounce.</i>

01:42.836 --> 01:44.971
<i>- What?
- No, I'm sorry. Matthew.</i>

01:45.038 --> 01:46.806
His oldest son is Matthew.

01:47.240 --> 01:50.176
You're about to interview
the Supreme Court nominee.

01:51.077 --> 01:53.546
This could be the biggest get
of our careers.

01:53.613 --> 01:55.682
Yes, and I am more than ready, Justin.

01:55.748 --> 01:57.116
You don't sound ready.

01:57.183 --> 01:59.452
If I'm gonna be stuck
with you as producer,

01:59.519 --> 02:02.121
I need you to recognize
that I do my research.

02:02.188 --> 02:03.156
<i>Prove it.</i>

02:04.190 --> 02:06.359
Judge McAlister is an avid birdwatcher.

02:06.426 --> 02:09.796
He competes in the Ironman competition
every year in Louisville.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.164
<i>He could've been a pianist,</i>

02:11.231 --> 02:13.333
but his mother forced him
to go to law school.

02:13.399 --> 02:15.235
He's a consummate and refined foodie,

02:15.301 --> 02:17.337
<i>but he swears that Hops Diner,</i>

02:17.403 --> 02:19.472
off of Route 25 in Colorado

02:19.539 --> 02:21.875
still serves
the best biscuits he's ever had.

02:21.941 --> 02:23.977
Shall I continue, Justin?

02:24.043 --> 02:26.412
He did the Ironman in Tempe,
not Louisville.

02:29.849 --> 02:31.718
<i>- From the top.
- All right,</i>

02:32.285 --> 02:33.253
let's go.

02:35.655 --> 02:36.589
Too much?

02:37.357 --> 02:40.560
They're coming to enjoy the hotel pool
for a couple hours, not move in.

02:40.627 --> 02:42.428
I just want your kids to like me.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.464
I appreciate that you care. I really do,

02:44.531 --> 02:46.533
but this won't make them like you.

02:47.233 --> 02:50.970
Babe, they're in that middle school phase
where toys aren't cool anymore.

02:52.872 --> 02:55.141
They're gonna be on their phones
all the time, right?

02:56.109 --> 02:57.210
Yeah.

02:57.277 --> 02:58.811
Come on.

03:00.480 --> 03:01.548
It'll be fine.

03:01.948 --> 03:03.149
Just be yourself.

03:03.783 --> 03:06.286
Lee, I know you. If your kids
don't like me, we're done.

03:07.287 --> 03:08.321
Yeah.

03:08.388 --> 03:09.489
No, I'm kidding.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.725
Look, you don't have to worry
about anything.

03:13.259 --> 03:14.661
They'll love you just like I do.

03:15.461 --> 03:16.396
You're amazing

03:18.164 --> 03:19.265
and smart

03:19.732 --> 03:22.235
and beautiful
and intelligent and delightful

03:22.702 --> 03:23.736
and unforgettable,

03:27.674 --> 03:28.908
and I've got to go to work.

03:30.743 --> 03:31.911
See you in the morning?

03:50.530 --> 03:53.166
Good eye. That table's fine real estate.

03:55.602 --> 03:57.270
- You going in?
- You know it.

03:58.771 --> 04:01.608
- Don't wait up for me.
- All right. My man.

04:08.715 --> 04:10.683
I'm a grown woman, you know?

04:11.451 --> 04:13.586
- Excuse me, I'm sorry...
- Do I know you?

04:14.120 --> 04:16.255
PJ Patterson, Comm 101?

04:17.457 --> 04:19.125
Damn, the last time I saw you,

04:19.192 --> 04:21.594
you were rocking sweatpants
and a muscle shirt.

04:22.962 --> 04:25.498
Yeah, that was a long, long time ago.

04:25.798 --> 04:27.033
Sure was.

04:29.335 --> 04:30.737
All roads lead to Manhattan.

04:31.971 --> 04:33.673
- How long are you here?
- I live here.

04:34.307 --> 04:37.210
I'm a real estate agent
at a firm in the city.

04:37.944 --> 04:41.014
That explains
your Armani entourage up there.

04:42.148 --> 04:43.816
Would you like to join us for a drink?

04:44.484 --> 04:47.086
I'm actually headed out.
I have an audition in the morning.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.789
- An acting audition?
- An acting audition.

04:50.056 --> 04:52.325
Okay. You still got that hustle, I see.

04:53.326 --> 04:54.694
We should catch up.

04:55.361 --> 04:57.263
Well, I'll be here tomorrow night.

04:57.530 --> 04:58.765
Maybe I'll see you then.

04:59.065 --> 05:01.668
These guys are always down
for a night of drinking, so...

05:02.769 --> 05:04.070
I'll get you whatever you want.

05:04.904 --> 05:06.539
I do enjoy a bottle of Dom.

05:08.307 --> 05:09.375
I'll get you two.

05:26.893 --> 05:28.327
Why do you have my phone?

05:28.828 --> 05:30.129
I don't have your phone.

05:31.798 --> 05:32.932
What's going on?

05:34.200 --> 05:36.235
Is there any chance I can convince you

05:36.302 --> 05:39.005
to enjoy a morning coffee with me
before you look at your phone?

05:44.644 --> 05:45.945
I'm in "The Observer?"

05:46.012 --> 05:47.313
Don't shoot the messenger.

05:47.747 --> 05:50.750
"Freshman correspondent
at 'Great Day USA' Mary Jane Paul

05:50.817 --> 05:54.120
seeks to oust
veteran anchor Ronda Sales?"

05:54.187 --> 05:55.354
Are you kidding me?

05:56.155 --> 05:57.623
Any chance of that coffee?

05:57.690 --> 05:59.826
"Ronda Sales had her time in the sun.

05:59.892 --> 06:01.694
It's my turn now," says Paul.

06:01.761 --> 06:03.629
They make me sound like a five-year-old.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.298
I didn't even give them this quote.

06:05.364 --> 06:06.365
So who did?

06:08.267 --> 06:09.235
Ronda.

06:18.144 --> 06:21.614
What is with this Mary Jane Paul
and Ronda Sales drama?

06:21.681 --> 06:22.949
Mary Jane who?

06:23.015 --> 06:26.052
She's a morning news correspondent
for "Great Day USA,"

06:26.119 --> 06:29.455
only been there a few weeks,
and now she's trying to take Ronda's job.

06:29.522 --> 06:32.191
So wait, the only two black women
on the show

06:32.258 --> 06:33.760
are now duking it out in the mud?

06:33.826 --> 06:35.828
I wouldn't mind
watching them mud wrestle.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.330
- No.
- Come on!

06:37.396 --> 06:40.399
All right, Mary Jane, what's her deal?
Is she a raging bitch or what?

06:40.466 --> 06:43.269
She must be if she's trying
to go out for poor Ronda Sales.

06:43.569 --> 06:46.839
I mean, this is the woman who hosted
the past four Olympic Games

06:46.906 --> 06:49.842
and has been the face
of morning news since I was a kid.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.145
<i>She's like a national treasure by now.</i>

06:52.211 --> 06:54.247
<i>Maybe she's past her prime.</i>

06:54.313 --> 06:57.383
<i>I mean, Mary Jane's younger.
She's hotter and she's got a...</i>

06:58.217 --> 07:00.319
Should Ty put a white streak
through my hair,

07:00.386 --> 07:02.755
or should I just have him
paint my face green?

07:03.523 --> 07:04.857
Why would he do that?

07:04.924 --> 07:07.426
He gave Ronda
that Glinda the Good Witch hairdo

07:07.493 --> 07:09.996
after she leaked
the story to "The Observer."

07:10.263 --> 07:13.766
I'm just gonna try to embrace
being the Wicked Witch.

07:13.833 --> 07:16.002
Okay, first of all, she got that haircut

07:16.068 --> 07:18.971
because she feels threatened,
not because she leaked the story.

07:19.038 --> 07:20.106
Second of all,

07:20.173 --> 07:23.509
she wouldn't be caught dead within
a ten-mile radius of that gossip rag.

07:23.576 --> 07:25.244
- You don't think it was her.
- No.

07:25.311 --> 07:27.146
She almost sued
a reporter a few months ago.

07:29.215 --> 07:30.383
So it was Justin?

07:34.086 --> 07:37.123
Listen, I have a girl at the tabloids.

07:37.190 --> 07:40.226
I'll call her up and ask
if she knows anything about it, okay?

07:41.761 --> 07:43.095
- I appreciate that.
- Yeah.

07:43.496 --> 07:45.865
I got to figure out
how to repair the damage.

07:45.932 --> 07:47.266
Yeah...

07:49.335 --> 07:50.269
You have an idea?

07:53.072 --> 07:55.808
There are sentences
that start off with conjunctions.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.611
They used the phrase "on fleek."

07:58.678 --> 08:00.813
If you are so offended by it,

08:01.247 --> 08:02.315
help me disprove it.

08:02.882 --> 08:06.018
- Why would I want to do that?
- You're like wounded prey

08:06.519 --> 08:07.987
oblivious to the sharks circling.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.256
That's a stretch.

08:12.892 --> 08:17.363
Okay, suppose I do want to put
this ridiculous rivalry business to rest.

08:18.097 --> 08:19.265
What do you have in mind?

08:20.099 --> 08:22.668
The two of us have lunch
at the corner table at Putney.

08:23.069 --> 08:24.170
A play date?

08:24.637 --> 08:25.972
That's your suggestion?

08:26.038 --> 08:29.375
It's the go-to spot
for all bloggers and tabloid reporters.

08:29.442 --> 08:33.880
I am not gonna risk my reputation
on a bunch of children with iPads.

08:33.946 --> 08:36.749
Those bloggers have ten times
the readership of "The Observer."

08:37.216 --> 08:39.785
Anything they write
spreads like wildfire.

08:40.286 --> 08:42.488
It's high school cafeteria
all over again.

08:42.555 --> 08:44.957
In this business, high school never ends.

08:45.524 --> 08:46.592
No.

08:46.659 --> 08:48.294
I will not stoop to their level.

08:48.761 --> 08:49.695
Fine.

08:50.296 --> 08:51.631
After the Judge interview,

08:51.697 --> 08:54.400
my name will be the only one
people are talking about anywhere.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.036
If he actually does it.

08:57.803 --> 09:01.040
I heard that Gayle King
is making a big play for McAlister.

09:01.540 --> 09:03.476
Can't say that it surprises me.

09:03.843 --> 09:07.413
His handlers are probably advising him
to sit with somebody more experienced.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.016
I have experience,
ten-years-experience at SNC.

09:10.783 --> 09:13.152
Ten years of late-night cable news.

09:14.053 --> 09:15.888
Hard-hitting news.

09:18.324 --> 09:19.292
You're right.

09:20.092 --> 09:21.160
It's probably nothing.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.331
But she does have Oprah.

09:29.068 --> 09:32.405
Screw the haters. She's just jealous
'cause she didn't get the interview.

09:32.471 --> 09:33.839
I know. It's a big scoop.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.474
- Hell yes, it is.
- Right...

09:37.376 --> 09:38.911
- Justin?
- Kara.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.615
Looks like you two
have a lot to talk about.

09:43.049 --> 09:45.351
- I need to call McAlister.
- I already did.

09:45.618 --> 09:48.154
Gayle King was sniffing around,
but he's still on board.

09:48.220 --> 09:50.589
- Still, I should...
- I already have my doubts

09:50.656 --> 09:52.358
about you being able to pull this off.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.859
I got us this interview.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.962
I've completed
all of your ridiculous tests.

09:56.028 --> 09:57.229
I am nothing but prepared.

09:57.296 --> 10:00.333
You're prepared for a softball interview,
and that is changing.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.068
Not now!

10:05.204 --> 10:06.505
Look, I got a scoop.

10:06.572 --> 10:11.043
A trusted source claims McAlister pitted
evidence as a prosecutor in Charlotte,

10:11.110 --> 10:14.380
sending at least one innocent black man
to prison, maybe more.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.515
And this got past everyone in Congress?

10:16.582 --> 10:17.950
They don't have my source.

10:18.017 --> 10:19.118
Who's your source?

10:19.185 --> 10:20.486
You know I can't tell you that.

10:21.754 --> 10:22.788
Your source is weak.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.424
McAlister's beloved
in the black community.

10:25.491 --> 10:27.193
People said the same about Clinton.

10:27.259 --> 10:30.029
His crime bill in 1994
sent more men to prison

10:30.096 --> 10:33.366
- than Nixon and Reagan combined.
- Bill Clinton wasn't a racist.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.534
But maybe McAlister is.

10:36.002 --> 10:38.237
- I need something stronger than a maybe.
- Do you?

10:40.473 --> 10:44.043
Who exposed the Catholic Church
sex abuse scandal?

10:44.744 --> 10:46.045
Lead water in Flint?

10:47.646 --> 10:48.581
Journalists.

10:49.215 --> 10:52.084
We have a journalistic duty
to break this story.

10:52.151 --> 10:53.619
If we do not expose this,

10:54.387 --> 10:56.689
McAlister moves on
to a lifetime appointment

10:56.756 --> 10:58.591
at the highest court in this country.

10:58.657 --> 11:02.595
You expect me to sandbag
the next Supreme Court Justice

11:02.661 --> 11:03.996
on national television?

11:04.063 --> 11:06.565
No, I expect you to eviscerate him.

11:29.989 --> 11:31.090
My God.

11:31.157 --> 11:33.426
- Have you been here all night?
- Practically.

11:33.492 --> 11:35.461
Looks like you need that
a lot more than I do.

11:37.363 --> 11:38.330
Shut the door.

11:43.169 --> 11:44.136
What's up?

11:45.738 --> 11:49.275
Justin has a source
that claims McAlister ignored evidence

11:49.341 --> 11:51.544
to put an innocent black man in prison.

11:51.610 --> 11:52.812
Holy shit.

11:53.579 --> 11:54.814
And you believe him?

11:54.880 --> 11:56.849
I did some digging on my own,

11:57.149 --> 11:58.517
and it does seem plausible.

11:58.884 --> 12:02.221
- So get the source to talk.
- The source won't come forward.

12:02.288 --> 12:04.323
I'm guessing that Justin won't reveal

12:04.390 --> 12:05.858
the identity of the source.

12:05.925 --> 12:09.328
- He expects you to go on air and what?
- See if I can get the judge to crack.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.630
Are you kidding me?
Mary Jane, you cannot attack

12:11.697 --> 12:14.033
a man who's gonna be
the next Supreme Court Justice.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.135
You're gonna look like
loony toon black woman

12:16.202 --> 12:18.270
who has an unsubstantiated bug
up her ass.

12:18.337 --> 12:19.405
I know,

12:19.472 --> 12:22.475
but what I can do is create some doubt.

12:22.541 --> 12:24.810
I can ask McAlister where he stands

12:24.877 --> 12:27.113
on some of the policies at that time

12:27.680 --> 12:30.449
and change the conversation
of the congressional hearings.

12:30.516 --> 12:32.818
- And what if he doesn't bite?
- But what if he does?

12:33.119 --> 12:35.221
I mean, if that guy had a hand

12:35.287 --> 12:37.556
in locking even one brother up
without reason,

12:39.992 --> 12:42.094
I can't let him reach the Supreme Court.

12:42.361 --> 12:43.863
I'm gonna say this now.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.464
I have a bad feeling about this,

12:45.531 --> 12:47.800
especially because Justin
is pushing you to do it.

12:47.867 --> 12:48.968
No, I hear you,

12:49.602 --> 12:52.304
but I've dealt with him before,
and I've learned my lesson.

12:53.472 --> 12:54.640
This time I have a plan.

12:57.343 --> 12:59.745
I am so sorry I'm late.
Are your kids here?

13:00.012 --> 13:01.580
I just have to change really fast.

13:03.215 --> 13:04.250
Sorry.

13:04.316 --> 13:05.751
- You must be Aidan.
- Hello.

13:05.818 --> 13:08.120
- Hi.
- Aiden and...

13:08.187 --> 13:09.588
- Nice to meet you.
- Katherine.

13:09.655 --> 13:11.590
- This is Mary Jane.
- Nice to meet you.

13:11.657 --> 13:12.658
Gosh, she's so cute.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.860
May we go down to the pool now?

13:14.927 --> 13:17.062
Of course. I just have
to change really fast,

13:17.129 --> 13:18.697
and we could head down. Sound good?

13:19.198 --> 13:20.332
- Sounds great.
- Okay.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.902
Come on. Let's get going.

13:24.170 --> 13:25.304
You nearly got her there.

13:26.906 --> 13:27.840
Okay,

13:28.474 --> 13:29.608
I'm almost ready.

13:31.577 --> 13:33.312
- May I ask you a question?
- Yes.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.680
How rich are you?

13:37.483 --> 13:39.718
Well, that depends
on what you consider rich.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.420
Are you richer than our dad?

13:41.487 --> 13:43.689
It's not appropriate
to ask about money, baby,

13:44.523 --> 13:45.558
but yeah, she is.

13:46.292 --> 13:47.359
Why don't you have kids

13:47.426 --> 13:49.295
if you're rich enough to have these toys?

13:49.361 --> 13:51.463
Katherine, you're asking
too many questions.

13:51.530 --> 13:54.333
It's okay. These toys are all for you.

13:54.400 --> 13:57.136
Why don't we go down to the pool
and stop with the inquisition?

13:57.703 --> 14:00.873
You told us to ask her questions
because everything was getting awkward.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.411
You know what is awkward?

14:06.145 --> 14:08.814
Your dad's corny board shorts,
that is awkward.

14:09.415 --> 14:11.784
- Yeah, why are you so embarrassing?
- Come on.

14:11.850 --> 14:14.053
I wear these so I can fit in
with the American dads.

14:14.119 --> 14:16.121
- Would you rather I wore the Speedo?
- No!

14:16.488 --> 14:18.157
Exactly, so no complaining.

14:18.457 --> 14:19.625
Come on, let's go.

14:28.400 --> 14:29.535
Ava, what's going on?

14:30.069 --> 14:32.004
Sorry for making you come
all the way here.

14:32.071 --> 14:34.340
I'm freaking out
about this internship thing.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.109
Tip number one,

14:37.476 --> 14:39.044
don't steal from the liquor stash.

14:40.913 --> 14:42.348
You're right. That was dumb.

14:44.149 --> 14:46.752
It's just everyone is so mean,

14:47.086 --> 14:48.520
and no one seems to notice me.

14:48.587 --> 14:50.022
Not what you're used to, right?

14:50.689 --> 14:53.225
I want to work hard.
I want to do a good job.

14:54.026 --> 14:56.428
I just don't know
how to make a good impression.

15:01.166 --> 15:04.536
My first internship was
at an architectural firm in Atlanta.

15:05.104 --> 15:07.039
I heard my boss was up
for a big promotion,

15:07.106 --> 15:09.541
so the next day I brought her
a bamboo plant.

15:09.608 --> 15:11.110
I can do bribes.

15:11.176 --> 15:13.279
It wasn't a bribe. It cost eight bucks.

15:14.146 --> 15:17.249
It's the meaning that counts.
Bamboo symbolizes good luck.

15:17.950 --> 15:19.051
Did it work?

15:19.118 --> 15:20.719
Turned into my first paying job.

15:22.888 --> 15:24.623
This business is so cutthroat though.

15:25.958 --> 15:28.927
- You have a friend in TV, don't you?
- I do, Andrew Cobb.

15:28.994 --> 15:30.763
He works in reality TV,

15:31.330 --> 15:33.532
but just like you,
he started as an intern.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.768
It's all about connections,
about networking.

15:36.635 --> 15:40.005
You know, your mom made me think
you don't take anything seriously.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.275
I'm glad to see you proving her wrong.

15:44.610 --> 15:45.978
I take you seriously.

15:49.214 --> 15:50.449
Thank you for your advice.

15:51.083 --> 15:52.184
Anytime.

16:20.779 --> 16:21.880
Put it away!

16:21.947 --> 16:23.048
No, no...

16:24.450 --> 16:25.651
I thought you were at the gym!

16:29.755 --> 16:31.523
We had a lovely afternoon, didn't we?

16:31.590 --> 16:32.591
Yeah.

16:33.992 --> 16:35.227
Thank you guys for coming.

16:35.594 --> 16:36.995
Are we still on for this evening?

16:38.697 --> 16:39.865
Yeah, yeah.

16:40.466 --> 16:41.433
Can we go?

16:43.068 --> 16:44.269
Bye, doll.

16:46.071 --> 16:47.072
I'll see you later.

16:48.073 --> 16:50.008
Don't be rude, son.
Shake Mary Jane's hand.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.018
- Bye.
- See you.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.863
So after college I came up here
to do musical theater.

17:11.363 --> 17:12.731
I'm in between gigs right now,

17:12.798 --> 17:15.367
but I did "The Lion King" tour
for three seasons.

17:15.434 --> 17:16.402
Okay.

17:16.802 --> 17:19.438
Well, let me guess. You were a gazelle?

17:20.005 --> 17:22.074
- I was a zebra.
-¿Zebra?

17:24.243 --> 17:26.545
Tell me, did you get to keep the costume?

17:26.812 --> 17:28.280
Wouldn't you like to know?

17:28.347 --> 17:29.381
PJ!

17:29.915 --> 17:31.250
Excuse me.

17:31.316 --> 17:32.284
What...?

17:32.618 --> 17:33.719
What are you doing here?

17:33.786 --> 17:35.921
Ava showed up to the house
looking for you.

17:35.988 --> 17:38.323
She seemed cool, so I brought her with.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.625
Champagne?

17:40.125 --> 17:41.360
Hi, I'm Ava.

17:42.261 --> 17:43.228
Sunitha.

17:44.963 --> 17:46.732
He is PJ's good friend Andrew.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.167
Nice to meet you.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.902
Excuse us for one second. Come on.

17:50.803 --> 17:52.371
Let me talk to you real quick.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.141
You realize she's only 22, right?

17:56.642 --> 17:57.876
Why would you bring her here?

17:58.377 --> 18:00.212
Bro, when did that ever stop you?

18:00.512 --> 18:01.847
Are you and PJ dating?

18:02.748 --> 18:04.316
No, we're just friends from college.

18:04.716 --> 18:06.785
Why don't we grab
another drink from the bar?

18:06.852 --> 18:07.820
Please.

18:08.587 --> 18:09.922
Don't forget your purse.

18:09.988 --> 18:11.390
Excuse me. No, don't.

18:11.457 --> 18:12.424
Thank you.

18:15.461 --> 18:16.962
- Have a sit.
- Thank you.

18:40.519 --> 18:41.587
Hey.

18:41.653 --> 18:42.988
Hey. Where are the kids?

18:43.956 --> 18:46.758
They're having an extra dip
in the pool before dinner.

18:47.092 --> 18:50.162
- If you're hungry, I can go get them now.
- You know, actually, I'm...

18:50.229 --> 18:51.430
I'm gonna need a rain check.

18:51.997 --> 18:53.332
No dinner tonight?

18:53.398 --> 18:56.502
I have a lot of work to do
before my interview tomorrow.

18:57.069 --> 18:58.136
All right.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.407
What's happening with you and Aidan?

19:03.342 --> 19:04.910
I don't want to mess anything up.

19:04.977 --> 19:05.978
Mary Jane.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.249
When I came up here earlier,

19:12.217 --> 19:14.019
I walked in on Aidan

19:16.488 --> 19:17.856
with my underwear.

19:18.423 --> 19:19.758
Shit.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.727
See? I told you. This is awful.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.062
He won't be able
to look me in the eye again.

19:24.129 --> 19:26.298
That's the only place
I'll ever let him look now.

19:26.365 --> 19:27.432
Not funny, Lee.

19:27.499 --> 19:29.535
I'm sorry. I joke when I'm worried.

19:30.435 --> 19:33.305
- So you are worried then?
- My son wanking to my girlfriend?

19:33.939 --> 19:35.374
Yeah, that's pretty worrisome.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.342
Kind of Shakespearean too, but.

19:38.744 --> 19:40.145
I'll go and talk to him.

19:41.113 --> 19:42.147
And?

19:43.115 --> 19:44.283
And we'll see.

19:51.657 --> 19:53.425
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

19:53.492 --> 19:54.593
Sorry about that.

19:55.193 --> 19:56.962
Yeah. It was interesting.

19:57.796 --> 19:59.932
Interesting is not the word for it.

20:01.366 --> 20:02.734
I'll be right back, okay?

20:02.801 --> 20:03.869
You leaving me?

20:05.304 --> 20:06.872
- Don't miss me too much.
- Okay.

20:09.908 --> 20:12.144
- Excuse me just one second.
- Okay.

20:18.483 --> 20:20.619
I make a great wing-woman, you know.

20:20.686 --> 20:22.321
What the hell are you doing, Ava?

20:22.387 --> 20:23.589
Trying to be a friend.

20:24.423 --> 20:25.791
You asked about my roommate

20:25.857 --> 20:28.060
to find out where I'd be hanging out.

20:28.126 --> 20:30.596
You should be flattered.
You're interesting.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.733
You won't take Sunitha
to your place in Brooklyn, right?

20:34.800 --> 20:36.335
That is none of your business.

20:36.802 --> 20:38.704
If you want to seal the deal,

20:38.770 --> 20:40.739
you should take her back
to my mom's place.

20:41.506 --> 20:42.641
Are you crazy?

20:42.941 --> 20:46.278
I'm serious. Your place
looks like a frat house.

20:46.345 --> 20:48.547
She is a sophisticated woman,

20:48.614 --> 20:51.283
and you are promoting
a million-dollar image here.

20:51.350 --> 20:52.618
You got to keep it up.

20:53.619 --> 20:54.820
You're something else.

20:55.687 --> 20:57.923
If you're worried
about my mom finding out, don't.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.458
I won't tell a soul, I swear.

21:01.860 --> 21:03.795
She's almost there, but it's gonna take

21:03.862 --> 21:06.765
a little bit more than a Rolex
to push her over the edge.

21:14.473 --> 21:16.208
- That's the zebra's sound.
- Really?

21:16.274 --> 21:18.010
Yeah, you never knew that?

21:18.076 --> 21:19.945
That was horrible. I didn't get that.

21:21.346 --> 21:24.216
You know I had
the biggest crush on you in college?

21:24.850 --> 21:26.084
The biggest crush.

21:26.351 --> 21:27.319
I knew.

21:27.853 --> 21:29.855
Wait, hold up. Get off me.

21:29.921 --> 21:32.524
You knew I had a crush on you
and didn't do anything about it?

21:32.591 --> 21:35.961
You were cute, but it just seemed like
you wanted to get by on your good looks.

21:36.028 --> 21:37.362
I'm so done with you.

21:37.429 --> 21:39.097
You didn't have a plan, PJ.

21:40.232 --> 21:41.266
You know what?

21:41.566 --> 21:43.468
You can tell now
that I've changed, right?

21:43.535 --> 21:45.337
- I've grown up a bit.
- I see.

21:45.404 --> 21:48.206
You got your fancy watch
and your fancy suits.

21:48.874 --> 21:50.242
Yeah, I do. Come here.

21:52.411 --> 21:54.646
You certainly seem to have
your shit together now.

21:55.580 --> 21:56.648
I think so,

21:57.449 --> 21:59.051
but I don't have everything I want.

22:01.219 --> 22:02.220
Come here.

22:02.854 --> 22:03.955
Give me those lips.

22:04.856 --> 22:08.226
Let's go back to your early days
as a young prosecutor in Charlotte.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.029
It was the deadliest year on record.

22:11.096 --> 22:12.531
Did your boss, D.A. Elmore,

22:12.597 --> 22:14.733
come in with a plan
to turn things around?

22:14.800 --> 22:16.902
You're stalling the issue.
Get to the point.

22:16.968 --> 22:19.771
If I start with the hard questions,
he'll clam up and deflect.

22:19.838 --> 22:21.506
But this isn't "60 Minutes".

22:21.573 --> 22:22.941
You got about five minutes,

22:23.008 --> 22:25.343
If you waste air
with the Barbara Walters banter,

22:25.410 --> 22:26.478
you'll run out of time.

22:26.545 --> 22:29.347
But I need more time
to lure him in and set the trap.

22:29.414 --> 22:33.585
Okay, please just explain to me
how you plan on trapping a judge

22:33.652 --> 22:36.054
with over 40 years
of cross-examination experience.

22:36.121 --> 22:37.189
You'll give him candy?

22:37.255 --> 22:39.991
No, I'm just trying to do
what you taught me, right?

22:40.659 --> 22:43.562
My angry black woman approach
did not work on "Talkback".

22:43.862 --> 22:45.464
It's definitely not gonna work here.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.266
Okay, you're probably right.

22:48.333 --> 22:50.035
I need to go with a softer approach.

22:50.102 --> 22:51.937
Like I said, you're right.

22:52.704 --> 22:53.872
Let's do it your way.

22:55.240 --> 22:56.908
- Did you just agree with me?
- Yes.

22:57.743 --> 22:59.945
Look, you're thinking
strategically, so...

23:00.011 --> 23:01.847
So what?

23:04.149 --> 23:06.918
Maybe you are the journalist
to break this story.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.090
Now, can we work on your style, please?

23:27.005 --> 23:30.108
"PJ, I didn't want to wake you.
I have an early audition.

23:31.276 --> 23:32.511
Call me later."

23:35.580 --> 23:36.815
This damn girl.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.855
Your work with former District Att...

23:45.323 --> 23:48.059
If you're gonna kill him with kindness,
do it with a smile.

23:48.460 --> 23:49.594
Right, right.

23:51.163 --> 23:52.364
Your work with...

23:53.131 --> 23:54.199
Less.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.034
- Too much, okay.
- Yeah.

24:00.772 --> 24:01.873
You...

24:01.940 --> 24:03.675
What? I said one word. What?

24:03.742 --> 24:05.343
It sounded accusatory.

24:06.111 --> 24:07.512
"You" sounded accusatory?

24:07.579 --> 24:09.781
That's generally
how most accusations start.

24:10.448 --> 24:12.083
Look, talk to him,

24:12.918 --> 24:13.919
not at him.

24:14.719 --> 24:17.255
Hey, this is what you wanted, all right?

24:17.722 --> 24:18.723
Again,

24:19.324 --> 24:20.392
from the top.

24:22.227 --> 24:25.864
Studies have shown
that stringent crime policies

24:25.931 --> 24:28.266
negatively impact communities of color.

24:29.734 --> 24:30.836
You're leaning in.

24:31.837 --> 24:33.872
- So?
- This is exactly what Ronda does

24:33.939 --> 24:35.774
when she's about to go in for the kill.

24:36.074 --> 24:37.876
I studied her delivery for years.

24:37.943 --> 24:40.645
Of course her style
will seep in sometimes.

24:40.712 --> 24:43.048
Okay, but you need to develop
your own style,

24:43.448 --> 24:46.318
otherwise you're always gonna be
a cheaper knockoff of Ronda's,

24:46.384 --> 24:48.687
and never be considered
for the anchor chair.

24:48.753 --> 24:50.722
Now focus.

24:52.057 --> 24:53.225
Let's start from the top.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.629
Come on. Come on.

25:30.896 --> 25:32.063
Are you serious?

25:35.500 --> 25:36.935
You got to be kidding me.

25:38.570 --> 25:39.938
This damn girl.

25:53.285 --> 25:54.352
Hey.

25:54.419 --> 25:56.922
I just got off the phone
with my girl over at the tabloids,

25:56.988 --> 25:59.858
and she said that the leak
came from the top.

26:00.158 --> 26:02.560
The network's
chief marketing officer is the one

26:02.627 --> 26:04.429
that fed the story to the tabloids.

26:05.430 --> 26:08.166
So this whole rivalry thing
goes way above Garrett?

26:08.566 --> 26:09.935
It may have been his idea,

26:10.001 --> 26:11.670
but obviously the brass is buying it.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.539
Maybe Ronda doesn't mind
being played a pawn, but I do.

26:19.144 --> 26:20.545
The judge brought his wife.

26:20.845 --> 26:22.047
She's the Attorney General.

26:22.681 --> 26:25.984
Ronda's must be there trying to get her
to sit for an interview as we speak.

26:26.051 --> 26:29.654
Is this gonna be my life,
playing "Battleship" with Ronda?

26:30.255 --> 26:31.723
I just want to do my damn job.

26:32.057 --> 26:33.992
Then do it and forget Ronda

26:34.059 --> 26:37.028
because at the end of the day,
the only thing anybody will remember

26:37.095 --> 26:39.230
is how you kicked ass
in this interview, so...

26:39.965 --> 26:41.066
Right. Right.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.134
- Watch me work.
- That's right.

26:44.769 --> 26:48.340
I just think it's so wonderful
to come out and greet us.

26:48.406 --> 26:50.608
We're just so thrilled that we got you.

26:50.675 --> 26:52.477
Mrs. McAlister, Judge McAlister,

26:52.544 --> 26:55.046
it's so great
that you are here on our show.

26:55.113 --> 26:57.349
I was telling them
that we thought for a moment

26:57.415 --> 26:58.950
we'd lost them to Gayle King.

26:59.017 --> 27:01.286
I have to admit she did approach us.

27:01.353 --> 27:04.122
But we pride ourselves
on always keeping our word.

27:04.189 --> 27:06.558
And promoting integrity and positivity

27:06.624 --> 27:09.361
is our number-one goal here
on "Great Day USA."

27:09.627 --> 27:12.897
- Isn't that right, Mary Jane?
- Absolutely, Ronda. Absolutely.

27:13.565 --> 27:15.567
Why don't I take you
on a tour of our studios?

27:15.633 --> 27:17.469
- Yes!
- Thank you. I cannot wait.

27:17.535 --> 27:18.703
Fantastic.

27:21.106 --> 27:23.408
I'm standing
in the way of progress, yes, yes.

27:29.381 --> 27:32.884
It is an honor to have a man
with your impeccable record

27:33.218 --> 27:35.220
- here on our show today.
- Thank you.

27:35.286 --> 27:38.056
I really owe a lot of that
to my good friend and mentor,

27:38.123 --> 27:39.724
District Attorney Jonathan Elmore.

27:40.025 --> 27:43.561
He really hammered home
the importance of prosecutorial ethics.

27:43.862 --> 27:45.730
Absolutely, I mean, Elmore was

27:45.797 --> 27:48.366
one of the most highly-regarded
prosecutors of his time.

27:48.433 --> 27:50.468
He worked extremely hard
to clean up our city

27:51.803 --> 27:52.871
He's a natural.

27:53.905 --> 27:56.374
Having a wife in the public eye
has served him well.

27:56.441 --> 27:57.609
I'll be sure to tell him so.

27:59.844 --> 28:01.579
The year before Elmore took office,

28:01.913 --> 28:06.518
that was dubbed the deadliest year
in the history of Charlotte.

28:06.584 --> 28:09.587
You can thank the crack cocaine epidemic
and guns for that.

28:10.155 --> 28:11.389
You're doing great,

28:12.357 --> 28:13.691
got him real comfortable.

28:14.592 --> 28:17.529
Those were all
career-defining cases for you.

28:17.595 --> 28:19.964
Well, it was never about fame for us.

28:20.298 --> 28:22.133
<i>It was about justice for the victims.</i>

28:22.200 --> 28:24.702
<i>- Now it's time to go in.
- I went to sleep every night</i>

28:24.769 --> 28:27.806
with the look of Mitchell Griffith's
grieving parents in my mind.

28:28.840 --> 28:31.309
I cannot imagine
what that must have felt like,

28:31.643 --> 28:35.647
with the whole city primed
to see justice served in that case,

28:36.014 --> 28:38.950
especially under
Elmore's Swift Justice campaign.

28:40.151 --> 28:42.754
Well, those were very tumultuous times.

28:42.821 --> 28:45.490
Other big cities, notably New York City,

28:45.990 --> 28:49.327
the pressure to close cases,
that led to police misconduct,

28:49.994 --> 28:51.896
<i>a rush to judgment, false confessions.</i>

28:52.931 --> 28:54.365
Where is she going with this?

28:54.966 --> 28:56.401
I honestly don't know.

28:56.468 --> 28:59.571
The prosecutors in our office
were held to a much higher standard.

28:59.971 --> 29:02.941
There were no prosecutors of color
in your office during your term,

29:03.408 --> 29:04.776
were there, Judge McAlister?

29:04.843 --> 29:08.813
And a disproportionate number
of your defendants were minority.

29:09.280 --> 29:12.450
The lack of ethnic parity doesn't
necessarily mean racial injustice.

29:12.517 --> 29:13.852
Now, we must stop this now!

29:15.653 --> 29:17.088
Garrett, we have a problem.

29:17.155 --> 29:19.657
- You need to end this immediately.
- Excuse me?

29:19.724 --> 29:21.860
These aren't the issues
we agreed to discuss.

29:21.926 --> 29:25.296
Your so-called correspondent
out there is attacking my husband.

29:25.363 --> 29:27.532
Justin, where is Mary Jane
going with this?

29:28.066 --> 29:29.501
We had some issues we're...

29:29.567 --> 29:31.703
If you don't do something now,
I'll go out there

29:31.769 --> 29:34.606
and snatch him right off the set!
Where are you going with this?

29:34.672 --> 29:36.674
Mary Jane, wrap this up
and go to commercial.

29:36.741 --> 29:38.977
<i>Reports show
that plans like Swift Justice</i>

29:39.043 --> 29:41.846
led to overlooked evidence,
falsified evidence.

29:41.913 --> 29:44.048
Mary Jane, throw us to commercial.

29:44.315 --> 29:46.151
This is important. Just let it play out.

29:46.217 --> 29:47.919
I am not gonna let this continue.

29:47.986 --> 29:50.288
That's it. We're going
to commercial in five...

29:50.355 --> 29:53.558
- We've never had a problem...
- I'll stop you right there, Judge.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.193
We've got to take a commercial break.

29:55.493 --> 29:56.928
I'll be back with more

29:56.995 --> 29:58.229
<i>"Great Day USA".</i>

29:58.296 --> 29:59.464
<i>I'm Mary Jane Paul.</i>

30:03.868 --> 30:05.603
Perry, this interview is over.

30:05.670 --> 30:07.472
- You can't just leave.
- I can take her.

30:08.039 --> 30:11.309
Don't you dare talk to me
about what we can and cannot do.

30:11.376 --> 30:14.112
Patricia, Judge, let's step
over here for a moment.

30:14.179 --> 30:15.480
Please, Judge, please.

30:19.951 --> 30:21.052
You okay?

30:21.553 --> 30:24.055
- I had him on the ropes.
- I could see that.

30:26.191 --> 30:28.092
We got enough. You did amazing.

30:33.198 --> 30:35.667
Okay, the... The judge and his wife

30:35.733 --> 30:38.403
have agreed to return
to complete the segment,

30:38.937 --> 30:41.339
but Ronda will finish out
the interview with you.

30:41.406 --> 30:42.473
- What?
- Garrett...

30:42.540 --> 30:44.842
Mary Jane earned this interview.
Let her finish.

30:45.310 --> 30:47.378
Justin, I want Ronda
to take the lead on this.

30:48.046 --> 30:50.114
And I'm just supposed
to sit here like a prop?

30:50.181 --> 30:52.617
Look, it's no secret that
I love the ratings boost

30:52.684 --> 30:54.252
that this rivalry has gotten us,

30:54.319 --> 30:57.088
but if you want this to go away,
then this is your chance to do it.

30:57.155 --> 30:58.856
Get back on air and show the world

30:58.923 --> 31:00.725
that you and Ronda are best friends.

31:03.228 --> 31:06.898
All right, we need two additional chairs
in here pronto, people.

31:06.965 --> 31:08.533
We're back on in 40, okay?

31:10.501 --> 31:11.769
That's the spirit.

31:12.904 --> 31:14.072
Now play nice.

31:18.576 --> 31:21.112
And so a game of catch

31:21.179 --> 31:24.482
turned out to be
a real teachable moment for all of us.

31:24.549 --> 31:25.783
They're so adorable.

31:25.850 --> 31:28.253
Grandchildren,
they're just precious, right?

31:28.319 --> 31:30.021
They grow up so fast too, right?

31:30.088 --> 31:31.289
Yes, indeed.

31:31.356 --> 31:34.692
It sounds to me that your grandson
has a future in politics?

31:34.759 --> 31:37.428
He says he wants to grow up
and be just like his pop-pop.

31:37.495 --> 31:38.696
Pop-pop.

31:48.940 --> 31:50.008
Guess what?

31:52.110 --> 31:54.212
You are looking at the newest member

31:54.279 --> 31:56.114
of the cast of Chris Rock's new pilot.

31:57.248 --> 31:58.416
That's good,

31:58.683 --> 31:59.917
great, awesome.

32:00.885 --> 32:02.086
What's with the face?

32:02.553 --> 32:05.123
- If you'll tell me the condom broke...
- No.

32:08.426 --> 32:10.928
Look, I woke up this morning
with a smile on my face,

32:12.130 --> 32:16.134
but then I rolled over,
and I discovered that my Rolex was gone.

32:16.200 --> 32:18.536
I mean, I'm not mad or anything,

32:18.603 --> 32:21.472
but that was a gift
from my mentor, and...

32:21.539 --> 32:24.175
I see, because I'm an actress I took it.

32:24.242 --> 32:26.010
It was only you there with me last night.

32:26.077 --> 32:28.012
How ignorant would I be
to take your watch?

32:28.079 --> 32:30.481
What other explanation
could there be? I'm sitting...

32:34.552 --> 32:35.687
Damn. Look,

32:36.087 --> 32:38.256
- Sunitha, I'm so sorry...
- No, I'm sorry.

32:38.323 --> 32:40.058
- I didn't take your watch, PJ.
- I know.

32:40.124 --> 32:42.193
I hope that whoever did
is having a good time

32:42.260 --> 32:43.695
benefiting from your stupidity.

32:44.228 --> 32:45.196
Sunitha.

32:52.670 --> 32:53.838
Thank you.

32:55.073 --> 32:56.207
Can you believe it?

32:56.274 --> 32:58.676
We were this close
to nailing McAlister, and then...

32:58.743 --> 33:00.912
Stop. Don't act like you won't go
to Ronda's office

33:01.179 --> 33:02.547
celebrating right after this.

33:02.914 --> 33:04.315
Why would I want to celebrate?

33:05.249 --> 33:07.485
Save it, Justin.
You probably went to Garrett

33:07.552 --> 33:10.521
to say I went rogue up there
and did my whole angry black woman thing,

33:10.588 --> 33:12.357
and amazingly, I walked right into it.

33:12.423 --> 33:16.060
Ronda just ruined what could be
a career-making interview for both of us,

33:16.127 --> 33:18.463
and I don't take kindly
to being stepped on.

33:19.597 --> 33:20.832
What are you trying to say?

33:20.898 --> 33:22.600
I'm saying you're not alone in this.

33:23.368 --> 33:25.203
I underestimated Ronda this time.

33:25.870 --> 33:27.405
I won't make that mistake again.

33:50.461 --> 33:52.397
- I'm sorry.
- You saw the interview?

33:52.463 --> 33:53.431
Yeah.

33:57.535 --> 33:58.703
Where are the kids?

33:59.504 --> 34:01.372
They're watching a movie at my place.

34:01.439 --> 34:02.907
I figured you need the space.

34:05.042 --> 34:06.177
Well,

34:07.812 --> 34:11.082
you've had the pleasure of watching me
fail miserably twice this week,

34:11.549 --> 34:14.118
once with this stupid interview
and once with the kids.

34:14.185 --> 34:15.753
No, you didn't fail either time.

34:15.820 --> 34:17.755
You already admitted
that you had a problem

34:17.822 --> 34:19.257
with what happened with Aidan.

34:19.323 --> 34:22.026
I was, but I realized
Aidan was objectifying you.

34:22.927 --> 34:25.830
You know, to him, you're just
a sexy woman he sees on TV.

34:26.697 --> 34:29.000
- I'm not gonna stop being on TV.
- No, but...

34:29.734 --> 34:31.302
Once he gets to know you,

34:32.203 --> 34:35.072
he'll stop seeing you as a pinup
and start seeing you like a mum.

34:35.907 --> 34:38.843
I guarantee any sexual feelings
he has towards you,

34:39.243 --> 34:40.211
they'll evaporate.

34:41.045 --> 34:44.148
- Being a mom makes me less sexy?
- To him, yeah.

34:44.782 --> 34:46.284
To me? Opposite.

34:47.985 --> 34:51.489
Look, I know this whole thing
is so awkward,

34:52.156 --> 34:54.292
but you got to understand
boys his age, they...

34:55.526 --> 34:58.162
They wank to anything, anyone, anywhere.

34:59.297 --> 35:00.431
So I'm not special?

35:00.498 --> 35:02.266
- Not even a little bit.
- Not even...

35:05.536 --> 35:06.771
So does this mean

35:07.839 --> 35:09.740
you want me to be a part
of your kids' lives?

35:10.975 --> 35:13.411
Just don't leave
your sexy underwear lying around,

35:13.744 --> 35:14.712
and we'll be fine.

35:16.180 --> 35:18.483
So I'm not, like,
even a little bit special?

35:19.917 --> 35:21.252
- Not at all?
- No.

35:21.319 --> 35:23.621
- Yeah?
- No. No, he'd wank at a door post.

35:23.688 --> 35:24.755
Nice.

35:32.463 --> 35:33.798
- PJ.
- Where is it?

35:33.865 --> 35:35.933
- Where is wh...
- I know you took my watch, Ava.

35:36.000 --> 35:36.968
Where is my watch?

35:45.076 --> 35:47.745
I've been nothing but nice to you,
and this is how you repay me?

35:48.045 --> 35:50.214
Come on. I was just having fun.

35:51.315 --> 35:54.051
The city view certainly
did its job last night.

35:54.118 --> 35:57.288
Because of you I've ruined
any chance that I had with Sunitha.

35:57.355 --> 35:59.624
We both know
that girl wasn't gonna work out.

36:00.491 --> 36:02.293
- I know guys like you.
- Really?

36:02.360 --> 36:03.594
What kind of guy is that?

36:03.661 --> 36:05.530
You never have one girl for too long.

36:06.330 --> 36:09.066
There's always some younger,
hotter girl waiting in the wings.

36:10.434 --> 36:11.936
Why not just cut to the chase?

36:22.713 --> 36:25.449
Wait, wait, slow down.
You're gonna burn your mouth.

36:25.816 --> 36:28.085
Bet you don't have
anything like that in England.

36:28.152 --> 36:29.487
No way.

36:29.554 --> 36:31.289
So we've had the pool party.

36:31.722 --> 36:33.424
We're having the pizza party.

36:33.491 --> 36:35.793
What other Americanisms
can my kids enjoy?

36:37.929 --> 36:39.797
Have you guys ever tried a jukebox?

36:41.265 --> 36:43.401
It's this old machine
that you put coins in,

36:43.668 --> 36:44.735
and music comes out.

36:45.269 --> 36:46.704
Why can't we just use our phones?

36:47.572 --> 36:50.741
Because it was made in this magical time
before phones existed.

36:51.409 --> 36:53.311
Plus, you can play what you want,

36:53.377 --> 36:55.780
and the entire restaurant
has to listen to your music.

36:57.648 --> 36:58.649
Cool!

36:59.050 --> 37:00.751
Let me get you some money.

37:02.153 --> 37:03.254
There you go.

37:05.089 --> 37:06.724
Say, "Thank you, moneybags."

37:06.791 --> 37:08.693
- Thanks, moneybags
- Thanks, moneybags.

37:09.694 --> 37:12.163
I swear, if you get
that nickname started,

37:12.229 --> 37:13.497
I'll call you "dad shorts."

37:14.031 --> 37:15.299
That's fair enough.

37:16.767 --> 37:18.836
- Thanks for talking to Aidan.
- Come on.

37:19.770 --> 37:21.172
It's water under the bridge.

37:22.373 --> 37:23.541
That's an idea.

37:24.008 --> 37:25.009
Kids,

37:25.643 --> 37:26.944
play Simon and Garfunkel.

37:29.046 --> 37:30.781
I swear, you are so white.

37:33.884 --> 37:34.952
Come on.

37:38.923 --> 37:39.890
There you go.

37:40.491 --> 37:42.560
It's not exactly an oldie,
but it is a goodie.

37:51.769 --> 37:52.770
Come here.

37:58.209 --> 38:01.278
The worst on-air fiasco I have ever seen.

38:04.982 --> 38:06.684
Ronda had to literally step in

38:06.751 --> 38:10.087
to prevent
the Supreme Court nominee and his wife

38:10.154 --> 38:11.756
from leaving mid-segment.

38:11.822 --> 38:14.458
If she'd just let the segment roll
to a natural endpoint...

38:14.525 --> 38:16.060
Trust me, it was over, okay?

38:16.127 --> 38:18.663
Let's not forget that McAlister

38:18.729 --> 38:20.464
did in fact railroad a man

38:20.531 --> 38:22.366
when he worked under Elmore in Charlotte.

38:23.834 --> 38:25.936
- That solid?
- Our research is impeccable.

38:26.303 --> 38:28.372
And yet they sat here
in the story meeting

38:28.439 --> 38:31.275
- and uttered not one word about it.
- You should've looped me in.

38:31.342 --> 38:35.046
- This could have been huge.
- Excuse me, but why am I here?

38:35.112 --> 38:38.249
- I'm not even on this story.
- You're here to clean up the mess,

38:38.983 --> 38:41.218
which is way worse
than I thought, by the way.

38:43.220 --> 38:45.656
Mary Jane and Justin
have totally pissed in the pool.

38:45.723 --> 38:47.258
If we want to use this material

38:47.558 --> 38:49.894
and break the story,
then we have to do it quickly.

38:51.429 --> 38:52.563
- Kara?
- Yeah?

38:52.630 --> 38:55.399
You and Ronda
are gonna take over the McAlister story.

38:55.466 --> 38:56.834
- Wait, that...
- And you guys

38:56.901 --> 38:59.136
will give them your research
and step out of the way.

38:59.203 --> 39:02.873
- We did all the work. This isn't fair.
- I'm not concerned with fair, Mary Jane.

39:02.940 --> 39:05.676
You kept this bombshell a secret
because you were afraid

39:05.743 --> 39:07.611
that it was gonna go to our star, Ronda,

39:07.678 --> 39:09.547
and guess what? You were right.

39:09.613 --> 39:11.716
This is not why
I signed up for "Great Day."

39:11.782 --> 39:13.484
We all know why you came here, Justin,

39:15.653 --> 39:18.189
but things change,
and you got to roll with it.

39:18.823 --> 39:20.791
So, we done?

39:21.559 --> 39:23.094
No, no, not quite.

39:23.160 --> 39:24.829
I need the name of Justin's source.

39:24.895 --> 39:26.363
I'm keeping my source private.

39:26.430 --> 39:29.366
This isn't the FBI asking, Justin.
This is your boss.

39:29.433 --> 39:31.502
Come on.
You're just doing it to mess with us.

39:31.569 --> 39:34.305
I'm doing that because
I have a prior arrangement with them.

39:34.371 --> 39:37.541
The import of this story
trumps any arrangement like that.

39:37.608 --> 39:39.810
- I have to keep my word.
- Mary Jane?

39:42.179 --> 39:44.648
I never knew the identity.
That was Justin's source.

39:45.116 --> 39:46.617
Now you're backing him up?

39:46.684 --> 39:49.053
If that's what you call
telling the truth,

39:49.120 --> 39:50.921
- I don't know what to tell you.
- Kara...

39:51.322 --> 39:53.491
I need some input as a producer here.

39:53.557 --> 39:56.060
My input is that this story's
gonna take a lot longer

39:56.127 --> 39:57.995
if we don't have the source, so...

39:59.296 --> 40:00.498
We need the source.

40:01.165 --> 40:03.334
Yup, we need the source.

40:05.236 --> 40:06.237
You two,

40:07.037 --> 40:08.139
give up the name

40:08.739 --> 40:11.175
or you are both on internal suspension.

40:11.609 --> 40:13.711
You get to decide which you want to keep,

40:14.311 --> 40:16.180
your word or your job.
