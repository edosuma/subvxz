Hey, Chris.

01:25.300 --> 01:29.033
Hey, Alan. Oh, hi.
Welcome to Sesame Street.

01:29.033 --> 01:31.233
Today we are having
a food festival.

01:31.233 --> 01:33.367
It's a fun way to learn
about other people's cultures.

01:33.367 --> 01:36.066
Culture?
What's culture?

01:36.066 --> 01:38.567
Oh, someone's culture
is the way they live--

01:38.567 --> 01:41.633
what clothes they wear,
what languages they speak.

01:41.633 --> 01:43.767
Oh, and what food
they eat.

01:43.767 --> 01:45.467
Yeah.
That's right, buddy.

01:45.467 --> 01:48.834
In fact, today we're gonna
check out foods from lots
of different places--

01:48.834 --> 01:51.667
China, Japan,

01:51.667 --> 01:55.133
South Africa, India,
just to name a few.

01:55.133 --> 01:57.133
Wow. Cool.
Oh, ho ho!

01:57.133 --> 01:59.233
Oh, hey, check it out.
It's Rosita and Abuela.

01:59.233 --> 02:01.600
- Bienvenidos.
- Hola, amigos.

02:01.600 --> 02:03.600
Hola, Abuela.
Hey, smells good.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.300
What do we have here?

02:05.300 --> 02:07.667
Well, we have some
of our favorite foods

02:07.667 --> 02:10.133
that come from
the country Mexico...

02:10.133 --> 02:12.233
- Como nosotros.
- Like us.

02:12.233 --> 02:16.000
Sí.  In our culture,
we eat tamales.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.233
Did somebody say
"cookies"?

02:18.233 --> 02:20.000
- Uh, no.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.533
No one said anything remotely
like the word "cookies."

02:22.533 --> 02:24.567
- Okay.
- You twist me arm.
Me try it.

02:24.567 --> 02:26.000
What? Oh, ho ho!

02:26.000 --> 02:28.567
Oh! Um...

02:28.567 --> 02:32.900
Nom nom nom! Nom nom nom!
Ooh! Nom nom!

02:32.900 --> 02:36.433
Uh-oh. Me got something
all over me arm.

02:36.433 --> 02:38.100
Ha ha ha!

02:38.100 --> 02:41.000
Oh, Cookie,
those are Mexican flan.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.533
Yeah. It's a kind
of a sticky dessert.

02:43.533 --> 02:46.934
Oh! Sticky, huh?

02:48.166 --> 02:49.533
- Oh!

02:49.533 --> 02:52.300
Hey!
Uh, excuse me.

02:52.300 --> 02:56.433
Me gonna go check out some
of the other food booths.

02:56.433 --> 02:58.367
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.

02:58.367 --> 03:00.300
Hey, come on, Rudy.
This is gonna be fun.

03:00.300 --> 03:02.400
There's foods

03:02.400 --> 03:04.867
Oh, nom nom nom.
Ha ha!

03:08.200 --> 03:10.266
Oh, hi, Abby.
Hi, Rudy.

03:10.266 --> 03:12.066
- Hi.
- Abuela and Rosita: Hola.

03:12.066 --> 03:13.934
Who wants
to try tamales?

03:13.934 --> 03:15.066
Sí. Pruénbalos.

03:15.066 --> 03:16.467
Oh, Elmo loves tamales.

03:16.467 --> 03:20.200
Ah, yummy yum. Yeah.
Have some, Rudy.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.066
- Yeah.
- Go on.

03:22.066 --> 03:25.166
Um... no, thank you.

03:25.166 --> 03:28.433
Huh? Oh, okay,
but remember, Rudy,

03:28.433 --> 03:29.900
you promised
Daddy Freddy

03:29.900 --> 03:32.734
you'd try at least
something today.

03:32.734 --> 03:36.967
Yeah, but I've never
smelled anything
like that before.

03:36.967 --> 03:40.166
I don't want any.
No, thank you.

03:40.166 --> 03:42.333
Well, um,
there are still

03:42.333 --> 03:44.066
plenty of food places
we could try.

03:44.066 --> 03:45.600
I'm sure we'll find
something you like.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.200
Yeah.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.600
Hey, let's check out
Lily's stand.

03:48.600 --> 03:51.166
Oh, cool.
Oh, thank you, Rosita.

03:51.166 --> 03:55.000
- Thank you, Abuela.
- Oh, de nada. Adiós.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.367
- Mas para nosotros.
Ha ha ha!
- Sí.

03:57.367 --> 03:59.033
Hmm. Ahh...

03:59.033 --> 04:00.567
Wow. Hi, Lily.

04:00.567 --> 04:02.233
- Hi, everyone.
- Hi.

04:02.233 --> 04:05.066
I have some food
from my country, China.

04:05.066 --> 04:06.600
Ah, ha ha!

04:06.600 --> 04:08.867
Ooh, is that a wonton?

04:08.867 --> 04:11.633
Yes. It's one
of my favorite foods.

04:11.633 --> 04:14.233
- Me! Me, me! Me!

04:14.233 --> 04:18.467
I mean, I'd be happy
to try a wonton... or two.

04:20.300 --> 04:24.033
Ooh, it sounds magical.
"Wonton." Ha ha!

04:24.033 --> 04:26.133
Hey, you want to try
a wonton, Rudy?

04:26.133 --> 04:28.934
Uh, what is it?

04:28.934 --> 04:31.867
Oh, Wonton is
a soft dough,

04:31.867 --> 04:34.467
and inside, it is filled
with meat or vegetables.

04:34.467 --> 04:36.066
- Mmm!

04:36.066 --> 04:38.734
Rudy: Mmph.
It looks wrinkly.

04:38.734 --> 04:41.066
Like a little
wrinkly pillow.
Ha ha ha!

04:41.066 --> 04:42.633
Oh, but it's not
how it looks, Rudy.

04:42.633 --> 04:44.300
It's how it tastes.

04:44.300 --> 04:47.700
Yeah. You never know.
Rudy might love it.

04:47.700 --> 04:49.667
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
I want to try.

04:49.667 --> 04:51.567
Okay. Here you go, Abby.

04:51.567 --> 04:54.033
Let's get you a nice
hot one.

04:54.033 --> 04:55.400
Okay. Here you go, Abby.

04:55.400 --> 04:56.900
Okay. Um...

04:58.867 --> 05:03.567
Mmm! Ah! Oh, it's good.
It really is, Rudy.

05:03.567 --> 05:06.200
Uh, do you
have a corn dog?

05:06.200 --> 05:08.633
Uh...

05:08.633 --> 05:13.900
Ha ha ha! I have never
seen corn dogs in China.

05:13.900 --> 05:15.567
You haven't?

05:15.567 --> 05:17.500
Well, each culture
has its own kinds of foods.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.000
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.567
Oh, you know what
I had never tried

05:20.567 --> 05:21.967
before coming
to Sesame Street?

05:23.100 --> 05:26.633
Peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches.

05:26.633 --> 05:28.233
- Mmm-mmm!

05:28.233 --> 05:30.400
And now I love them.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.433
Cookie Monster:
Hey, look at this.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.433
Me found more food.

05:35.567 --> 05:38.233
Delicious, also
a little bit sticky.

05:39.533 --> 05:41.900
Oh, chickens,
oh, that-- oh, no.

05:41.900 --> 05:45.100
That me sushi. Bad chickens.
That me appetizer.

05:45.100 --> 05:47.133
Oh, wow.
Ha ha ha!

05:47.133 --> 05:48.800
It looks like
they're enjoying the foods

05:48.800 --> 05:50.166
from all
the different countries.

05:50.166 --> 05:53.133
Well, I'm glad someone's
enjoying themselves.

05:53.133 --> 05:54.767
Lucky ducks.

05:54.767 --> 05:56.700
Uh, no. Chickens.

05:56.700 --> 05:58.133
Boy, there has to be
something here

05:58.133 --> 05:59.700
that Rudy would like.

05:59.700 --> 06:01.033
Ah!

06:01.033 --> 06:03.200
Alan probably has something
that Rudy might like.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.300
Come on. Come on.

06:04.300 --> 06:06.667
Elmo:
Come on, everybody.
Thank you, Lily.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.367
- Bye-bye. Good luck.
- Bye, Lily.

06:08.367 --> 06:09.700
Here you go, Zoe.

06:09.700 --> 06:13.934
Arigato gozaimasu,  Alan.
That means "thank you."

06:13.934 --> 06:16.000
- Whoa.
- So good.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.166
- Thanks, Alan.
- You're welcome.

06:17.166 --> 06:19.000
- Yeah. Thanks, Alan.
- Sure. Bye, Herry.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.200
- Hey, Alan.
- Hey, guys.

06:20.200 --> 06:22.233
Hiya, Alan.
Hey, what you cooking?

06:22.233 --> 06:25.200
Well, I've got lots
of foods from Japan.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.900
That's the country that
my great-grandparents are from.

06:27.900 --> 06:29.300
- Wow. That's cool.
- Ooh.

06:29.300 --> 06:33.500
Hey, there's what I think
Rudy might like

06:33.500 --> 06:34.900
- Udon.
- Udon. Udon.

06:34.900 --> 06:36.200
- Oh.
- That's right.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.433
Udon?

06:37.433 --> 06:40.033
That's right.
Udon is a kind of noodle.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.767
It's a part
of Japanese culture,

06:41.767 --> 06:44.000
just like the robe
that I'm wearing,

06:44.000 --> 06:45.533
which is called
a happi coat.

06:45.533 --> 06:47.100
Elmo:
A happi coat.

06:47.100 --> 06:48.867
Did you hear that,
Rudy?

06:48.867 --> 06:51.467
Udon is a noodle
just like spaghetti.

06:51.467 --> 06:54.066
Yeah, but spaghetti
isn't called udon.

06:54.066 --> 06:56.033
I've never heard
of that before.

06:56.033 --> 06:58.166
Uh, well,
you know what?

06:58.166 --> 07:01.467
I'm gonna try udon,
even if Rudy won't.

07:01.467 --> 07:02.633
Great, and look.

07:02.633 --> 07:05.200
People in Japan
use chopsticks.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.166
Open up.
- Oh, okay. Go.

07:07.166 --> 07:09.300
Go!
- Go!

07:10.867 --> 07:14.533
Ahh. Ah! Oh, Rudy,
these are so good.

07:14.533 --> 07:15.867
You got to try some.

07:15.867 --> 07:18.300
Uh, no, thank you.

07:18.300 --> 07:20.100
You know what, Rudy?

07:20.100 --> 07:21.967
I liked everything
over at Zuzu's booth.

07:21.967 --> 07:23.333
Why don't you go
check it out?

07:23.333 --> 07:25.333
Yeah. Come on, guys.
Let's go. Thank you, Alan.

07:25.333 --> 07:27.233
- Thanks, Alan.
- All right. You're welcome.

07:27.233 --> 07:29.333
- That was good.
- Yeah. Come back later.

07:29.333 --> 07:32.000
Wow.
Pap and to-may-to gravy.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.934
Uh-uh. To-mah-to.

07:33.934 --> 07:35.266
That's what I said--
to-may-to.

07:35.266 --> 07:38.834
- Oh, Zuzu, hi.
- Hey, Zuzu.

07:38.834 --> 07:41.800
Wow. That smells good.
What are you cooking?

07:41.800 --> 07:43.800
This is chakalaka.

07:43.800 --> 07:47.633
It is from South Africa,
just like me.

07:47.633 --> 07:50.200
It is made out of beans
and other vegetables,

07:50.200 --> 07:53.100
and, oh,
it can be very spicy.

07:53.100 --> 07:55.500
Ooh, hey, you know,
I love spicy food.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.033
Uh, can I try some?

07:57.033 --> 07:59.900
- Sure, Chris. There you go.
- Oh, ho ho.

07:59.900 --> 08:01.867
- Here we go.
- Careful.

08:01.867 --> 08:03.600
- Okay. Here we go.
- Mm-hmm.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.200
Mmm. Mmm! Ooh!

08:06.200 --> 08:08.066
Zuzu:

08:08.066 --> 08:10.900
Mmm! Wow. That is hot.
Oh, my goodness, that's spicy.

08:10.900 --> 08:12.734
That's so good.

08:12.734 --> 08:14.967
Oh, I can't feel
my tongue. Oh!

08:14.967 --> 08:16.233
More, please.
More, please.

08:16.233 --> 08:19.800
I think chakalaka might be
a little spicy for us.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.133
Just a little.

08:21.133 --> 08:23.433
Hey, I might have
some food you like.

08:23.433 --> 08:25.600
- Oh, Chamki.
- Hiya, Chamki.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.200
- Hi, Elmo.
- Hey, Abby.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.500
- Hey, Chamki. Hey.
- Hey, Chris.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.333
- Oh, hi, Chamki.
- Hey.

08:30.333 --> 08:33.200
Oh, does Chamki have food
from the country India?

08:33.200 --> 08:35.000
Of course I do,
right here.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.900
Oh, cool.

08:36.900 --> 08:39.467
I thought Indian food
was really hot and spicy.

08:39.467 --> 08:43.467
Well, some of it is,
but not all of it.

08:43.467 --> 08:46.533
See, right here,
this is palak paneer,

08:46.533 --> 08:49.266
and it's only just
a little bit spicy.

08:49.266 --> 08:50.467
What's palak paneer?

08:50.467 --> 08:52.734
It's made
with spinach and cheese.

08:52.734 --> 08:55.100
- Ah.
- Mmm!

08:55.100 --> 08:57.800
Oh, and, uh,
what is this bread?

08:57.800 --> 09:01.166
Ooh, it's a very
special bread from India.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.500
It's called naan.
Ha ha ha!

09:03.500 --> 09:04.633
Ohh.

09:04.633 --> 09:07.000
Bread

09:07.000 --> 09:10.166
Oh, like a grilled
cheese sandwich?

09:10.166 --> 09:13.834
Uh-- ha ha ha!
Well, sort of.
Maybe. Yeah.

09:13.834 --> 09:15.734
Ah!

09:15.734 --> 09:18.700
It's your two favorite foods,
Rudy--

09:18.700 --> 09:22.033
bread and cheese, huh?

09:22.033 --> 09:24.033
I don't know.

09:24.033 --> 09:26.867
I've tried
palak paneer once,

09:26.867 --> 09:30.166
and now it's one
of my favorite foods.

09:30.166 --> 09:31.867
Hey, I never tried
Japanese food

09:31.867 --> 09:33.367
before Alan taught me
how to cook it.

09:33.367 --> 09:36.000
Now I eat it
all the time.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.934
But how did you know
that you'd like it?

09:38.934 --> 09:40.734
Um, I didn't
until I tried it.

09:40.734 --> 09:42.934
Well, in that case...

09:42.934 --> 09:45.600
You'd try some? Ah...

09:45.600 --> 09:47.100
I guess. Yes.

09:47.100 --> 09:48.900
- Yeah.
- Yay.

09:48.900 --> 09:51.333
Here we go.
- Get some naan first,

09:51.333 --> 09:54.166
- and let's get a little bit
of this here...
- Yes, please.

09:54.166 --> 09:56.500
- Boy, it looks great.
- And here you go, guys.
This is for you.

09:56.500 --> 09:59.000
- Oh, thank you, Chris.
- You're welcome.
Ha ha ha!

10:00.734 --> 10:02.633
Mm-mmm!

10:02.633 --> 10:04.633
Ha ha! Yummy.
Ha ha ha!

10:04.633 --> 10:07.367
Well?
You like it, Rudy?

10:08.767 --> 10:11.300
Can I have some more,
please?

10:11.300 --> 10:13.367
- Oh, ho ho!
- Yes!

10:14.967 --> 10:17.133
Well, this has been
an interesting day.

10:17.133 --> 10:18.600
It really is great
getting to learn

10:18.600 --> 10:19.767
about different cultures,

10:19.767 --> 10:22.533
like Mexico, China,

10:22.533 --> 10:26.000
Japan, South Africa,
and India.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.133
It really is a whole world
of delicious food out there.

10:28.133 --> 10:29.133
Yeah.

10:29.133 --> 10:30.567
Oh, hey, whoa.
Chicken, wait. No.

10:30.567 --> 10:32.700
That me burrito.
Chicken, put it down. Wait.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.633
No. Me saving that for later.
Wait. Chicken, back.

10:35.633 --> 10:37.233
Oh, Cookie,
come on.

10:37.233 --> 10:39.233
Wow.
Anybody want some naan?

10:39.233 --> 10:40.567
Hey, you want some more?

10:43.467 --> 10:47.934
Remember today's
kind moment with Elmo.

10:47.934 --> 10:50.533
Elmo will try it, too.

10:50.533 --> 10:53.066
Well, in that case...

10:53.066 --> 10:54.867
You'd try some?

10:54.867 --> 10:56.500
Here you go, guys.
This is for you.

10:56.500 --> 10:59.400
- Thank you, Chris.
- You're welcome.

10:59.400 --> 11:02.100
Yummy.

11:02.100 --> 11:04.200
Can I have
some more, please?

11:04.200 --> 11:05.700
Oh, ho ho!

11:07.233 --> 11:09.600
Boy #1:
Thanks, Mom.

11:09.600 --> 11:12.133
- Falafel.

11:12.133 --> 11:15.633
Elmo:
It's kind-- and kind of fun--
to try new foods.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.066
It's really good.

11:21.066 --> 11:23.433
Now go do something kind.

11:26.767 --> 11:28.433

Abby:
"F" is for "food."

12:12.800 --> 12:16.734
Hi. I'm Padma Lakshmi,
and welcome to "Sesame Chef."

12:16.734 --> 12:18.133
- Yeah, baby.
- Oh, boy.

12:18.133 --> 12:19.967
Hi, Mommy. Ha ha!

12:19.967 --> 12:23.700
A competition to find
the best cook on Sesame Street.

12:23.700 --> 12:27.867
"F" is for "food,"
and I've asked you all
to make a food

12:27.867 --> 12:30.800
using the same ingredient--
cheese.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.200
Yeah. Ha ha ha!

12:32.200 --> 12:33.967
- Hi, Elmo.
- Oh, hi, Miss Padma.

12:33.967 --> 12:36.667
- Very well, thank you.

12:36.667 --> 12:39.133
It's nice to see you.
What have you made
for us today?

12:39.133 --> 12:41.900
Oh. Well, Elmo made
cheese and banana mush.

12:41.900 --> 12:44.967
Oh, because Elmo likes cheese
and Elmo likes banana.

12:44.967 --> 12:47.033
And Elmo likes mush.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.266
- Hi, Cookie.
- Hi.

12:48.266 --> 12:49.467
How you doing?

12:49.467 --> 12:51.133
Me terrific.

12:51.133 --> 12:53.433
What did you make
for us today?

12:53.433 --> 12:56.500
Me made
a delicious cheesecake

12:56.500 --> 12:58.300
with cookie crust.

12:58.300 --> 12:59.934
Mmm,
that sounds delic--

12:59.934 --> 13:01.100
Yeah.

13:01.100 --> 13:03.066
Where is it?

13:03.066 --> 13:04.967
Me told you
it was delicious.

13:04.967 --> 13:06.667
Mrrp! Excuse me.

13:06.667 --> 13:08.500
- Cookie!
- Sorry.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.400
Hi, Prairie Dawn.
I'm counting on you.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.233
- Hello, Padma Lakshmi.

13:12.233 --> 13:13.967
- I'm great.

13:13.967 --> 13:16.567
Now, I know you worked hard.
What did you make?

13:16.567 --> 13:21.100
Well, I have constructed
my very own dream castle

13:21.100 --> 13:24.700
made entirely
out of cheese,

13:24.700 --> 13:28.600
and some of its features
include a Swiss staircase

13:28.600 --> 13:34.333
and a little Brie ballroom
and a Gouda great hall.

13:34.333 --> 13:37.700
That is very impressive,
but how does it taste?

13:37.700 --> 13:39.533
Taste?
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no.

13:39.533 --> 13:40.567
Wait. What are you doing?

13:40.567 --> 13:41.934
No, no, no.
You cannot taste it.

13:41.934 --> 13:45.533
No, that would ruin
the integrity of
the dream castle.

13:45.533 --> 13:48.700
No. This is food
for looking at,
not for eating.

13:50.667 --> 13:52.233
Okay, fine.

13:52.233 --> 13:55.200
Our final chef
is Oscar the Grouch,

13:55.200 --> 13:57.500
and what food have you
got for us, Oscar?

13:57.500 --> 14:01.900
Well, it's my very own
cheesy crunch surprise.

14:01.900 --> 14:04.033
I used the stinkiest cheese
I could find

14:04.033 --> 14:06.867
and added a smidge
of sardine juice for flavor.

14:06.867 --> 14:08.734
Heh heh heh!

14:08.734 --> 14:10.967
And what gives it
the crunch?

14:10.967 --> 14:14.767
Fish bones. Go ahead.
Give it a try.

14:14.767 --> 14:18.734
Ooh, I can see that.
I'm not sure I want
to eat that.

14:18.734 --> 14:22.800
- Me try!
- Say, that mushy junk of
Elmo's doesn't look bad, either.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.900
- Oh, try some, Oscar.
- Oh, don't mind if I do.

14:24.900 --> 14:26.400
- Uh-huh.
- Heh heh heh.

14:26.400 --> 14:27.767
Elmo:
What do you think?
What do you think?

14:27.767 --> 14:29.133
Cookie Monster:
Oh, you know what?

14:29.133 --> 14:31.367
The letter "F"
is for "food."

14:31.367 --> 14:34.500
I think I'll just
pack my fork and go now.

14:34.500 --> 14:35.767
Me draw the line
at fish bones.

14:35.767 --> 14:37.500
What's that?
More fish bones?

14:37.500 --> 14:39.133
No, no.
Me got plenty
of fish bones here.

14:39.133 --> 14:43.200
I got more fish bones
right here for you,
Cookie Monster.

Hello, Gonger

15:07.600 --> 15:10.800
My name is Aaron and my family's
favorite food is tacos.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.767
Can you help us, please?

15:12.767 --> 15:16.600
Of course we can help you
because we are...

15:16.600 --> 15:19.300
Both:

15:19.300 --> 15:20.433
Oh, yeah.

15:20.433 --> 15:22.467
Okay, what we do first,
Chef Gonger?

15:22.467 --> 15:24.400
Gonger:
Oh, first, we look
at the ingredients.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.166
Cookie Monster:
Yes. Ingredients.

15:26.166 --> 15:29.033
Gonger:
We need taco shell
and fillings.

15:29.033 --> 15:33.367
Okay, this great news
because we got the taco
fillings right here

15:33.367 --> 15:36.600
and we got taco shells.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.467
- Yeah. Heh heh.
- Oh, boy.

15:39.467 --> 15:43.600
Mmm!
These look nice and crunchy.

15:43.600 --> 15:44.867
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Cookie, Cookie!

15:44.867 --> 15:47.133
Cookie, Cookie,
don't eat the taco shells.

15:47.133 --> 15:48.500
Sorry. Don't what?

15:48.500 --> 15:50.700
Eat the taco shells.
Whew!

15:50.700 --> 15:53.100
If you say so.
Ah! Oh! Nom! Nom!

15:53.100 --> 15:54.533
Cookie, Cookie,
Cookie, no!

15:54.533 --> 15:58.467
Cookie,
why you do this to me?

16:00.000 --> 16:01.967
How could you do this?

16:01.967 --> 16:03.433
Me sorry.

16:03.433 --> 16:06.700
Oh, you know, me no
could resist their crunchiness.

16:06.700 --> 16:08.200
Here. Have a crumb.
These are really--

16:08.200 --> 16:10.300
No!

16:10.300 --> 16:12.834
Oh, Gonger,
you know what?

16:12.834 --> 16:16.333
Don't worry because we could
just make some more taco shells.

16:16.333 --> 16:18.633
Oh, but you don't
have any corn.

16:18.633 --> 16:20.333
Corn?

16:20.333 --> 16:21.734
What that got to do
with taco shell--

16:21.734 --> 16:23.266
wait a minute.

16:23.266 --> 16:28.867
Are you telling me
that taco shells
are made from corn?

16:28.867 --> 16:30.900
This blow me monster mind.

16:30.900 --> 16:33.200
Oh, look. Follow me.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.600
Wait.
How this possible?

16:34.600 --> 16:37.500
Taco shells are crunchy.
Corn, that not crunchy.

16:42.867 --> 16:45.266
Both:
To the factory.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.033
Cookie Monster:
We're going to the factory.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.433
Hello, Cookie Monster
and Gonger.

16:59.433 --> 17:01.166
Cookie Monster:
Hi, Mr. Factory worker guy.

17:01.166 --> 17:04.066
We need taco shells,
and Gonger tells me

17:04.066 --> 17:06.200
that they're made of corn.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.367
Well, you came
to the right place.

17:08.367 --> 17:11.967
Taco shells
are made from corn.

17:11.967 --> 17:14.000
First, the corn
grows on a farm.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.867
Then after it's picked,
it's brought to our factory,

17:16.867 --> 17:20.133
where we turn the corn
into taco shells.

17:20.133 --> 17:23.133
Let me show you
how it's done.

17:23.133 --> 17:25.567
The corn is cooked,

17:25.567 --> 17:27.934
soaked,

17:27.934 --> 17:29.633
cut into circles,

17:29.633 --> 17:31.500
and then shaped
into taco shells

17:31.500 --> 17:33.400
just like these.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.867
Here you go.

17:34.867 --> 17:37.734
Cookie Monster:
Wow. Thank you,
Mr. Factory worker guy.

17:39.233 --> 17:41.667
Cookie Monster:
We got taco shells.

17:41.667 --> 17:44.533
Okay. Bring it in.
Hey, Gonger, you need help?

17:44.533 --> 17:45.767
No, no, no.
I'm fine.

17:45.767 --> 17:47.066
You sure?

17:47.066 --> 17:49.166
Yeah, yeah. Hold on.
Ooh! Whew!

17:49.166 --> 17:51.066
Wow.
You a strong little guy.

17:51.066 --> 17:52.133
Thank you.

17:53.567 --> 17:55.800
Gonger:
Okay. Ground beef.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.200
Cookie Monster:
Ground beef.

17:57.200 --> 18:01.500
Nice. Yeah.

18:01.500 --> 18:04.166
Grated cheese.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.033
Grated cheese.

18:06.033 --> 18:07.767
Shredded lettuce.

18:07.767 --> 18:09.667
Shredded lettuce.

18:09.667 --> 18:12.133
Oh, Cookie,
you're great at this.

18:12.133 --> 18:13.333
Diced tomatoes.

18:13.333 --> 18:15.233
Diced tomatoes.

18:15.233 --> 18:18.633
There you go. Yeah.

18:18.633 --> 18:21.033
These tacos look
muy excelente.

18:21.033 --> 18:22.433
Yeah. Ho ho!

18:22.433 --> 18:26.300
- It's ready! Ooh!

18:26.300 --> 18:28.467
Order up.

18:28.467 --> 18:30.667
Ta-ta, taco.

18:30.667 --> 18:34.633
Adiós,  taco.
Oh, me so hungry.

18:34.633 --> 18:36.300
Oh, Cookie Monster...

18:37.400 --> 18:39.300
I got this nice for you.

18:39.300 --> 18:41.233
Oh, thank you, Gonger.

18:41.233 --> 18:42.300
Yeah. Heh heh.

18:42.300 --> 18:43.700
Oh, you want to share?

18:43.700 --> 18:44.734
Yes, please.

18:44.734 --> 18:46.300
- Okay.

18:46.300 --> 18:48.500
- Oh, thank you.
- Here you go.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.166
Oh, heh heh. Oh.

18:55.533 --> 18:58.233
- Ooh ooh!

18:58.233 --> 19:02.600
Thank you for delivering

20:27.200 --> 20:31.433
Oh, guess what Elmo is
wondering about today.

20:31.433 --> 20:33.567
Wait for it.

20:33.567 --> 20:36.367
Wai-ai-ait for it!

20:36.367 --> 20:39.133
Oh, ho ho ho!
Cooking!

20:39.133 --> 20:40.567
Oh!

20:40.567 --> 20:43.600
- Smells good, Cookie.
- Thank you very much.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.200
Ha ha ha!

20:45.200 --> 20:49.400
Boy, Elmo loves cooking
and wants to find out
more about it.

20:49.400 --> 20:53.233
Hey! Let's ask
Elmo's friend, Smartie.

20:53.233 --> 20:54.967
Let's call her together.

20:54.967 --> 20:57.066
Elmo and kids:
♪ Oh, Smartie ♪

20:57.066 --> 20:59.200
( chime playing
"Elmo's Song" )

20:59.200 --> 21:00.867
Cooking?

21:00.867 --> 21:05.033
I enjoy cooking as much
as I enjoy recharging,
and that's a lot.

21:05.033 --> 21:06.266
Oh, ho ho ho!

21:06.266 --> 21:08.066
Oh. What is
Smartie wearing?

21:08.066 --> 21:09.266
It's a chef's hat.

21:09.266 --> 21:10.333
What would you
like me to cook?

21:10.333 --> 21:11.567
Oh, well,
well, well, nothing.

21:11.567 --> 21:13.000
Elmo isn't hungry.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.100
Elmo just wants
to learn about cooking.

21:15.100 --> 21:17.266
What do we do
to learn something new?

21:17.266 --> 21:20.600
All:
We look it up!

21:20.600 --> 21:23.433
Searching for cooking.
Here we go!

21:23.433 --> 21:25.633
Smartie:
Cooking starts
with a recipe.

21:25.633 --> 21:28.233
A recipe tells you
the ingredients you need.

21:28.233 --> 21:29.500
Before you cook,

21:29.500 --> 21:31.800
it's important
to wash your hands.

21:31.800 --> 21:35.033
The recipe tells you how much
of each ingredient to use.

21:40.066 --> 21:43.367
Next, you put all
the ingredients together!

21:43.367 --> 21:44.734
Elmo:
Oh, ho ho! Look!

21:44.734 --> 21:46.433
They're mixing it all up.

21:46.433 --> 21:48.934
Smartie:
Right, and now they're
rolling out the dough.

21:48.934 --> 21:51.800
They're putting tomato sauce
on it and cheese.

21:51.800 --> 21:53.500
Elmo:
They're making pizza!

21:53.500 --> 21:55.800
Smartie:
Got to set the timer!

21:55.800 --> 21:58.700
The best part of cooking
is what comes next--

21:58.700 --> 22:02.333
eating-- and eating is
a great way to refuel,

22:02.333 --> 22:04.100
which gives you
more energy!

22:04.100 --> 22:05.333
Uh-huh!

22:05.333 --> 22:08.667
Oh, which reminds me--
I got to go recharge.

22:08.667 --> 22:09.800
See you later, Elmo!

22:09.800 --> 22:11.500
Bye-bye, Smartie!

22:11.500 --> 22:14.667
Boy, there's so many
different ways to cook.

22:14.667 --> 22:18.633
Hey! That gives
Elmo an idea.

22:18.633 --> 22:21.433
Oh, come on.
Let's play a game together.

22:21.433 --> 22:23.000
Yeah-eah-eah!
Come on, come on!

22:27.567 --> 22:31.600
Oh, Elmo wonders
if we can follow a recipe.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.700
Are you ready?
Let's play!

22:33.700 --> 22:35.900
This recipe shows
how to make

22:35.900 --> 22:39.367
a mushroom-avocado
quesadilla.

22:39.367 --> 22:42.100
What ingredient
do we need first?

22:42.100 --> 22:44.367
Kid:
One scoop of cheese!

22:44.367 --> 22:47.333
Elmo:
One scoop of cheese.
Check!

22:47.333 --> 22:49.533
What ingredient comes next?

22:49.533 --> 22:51.533
Kid:
Two mushroom slices!

22:51.533 --> 22:53.633
Elmo:
One mushroom slice,

22:53.633 --> 22:55.567
two mushroom slices.

22:55.567 --> 22:56.967
Check!

22:56.967 --> 22:59.500
Kid:
Next, three slices
of avocado.

22:59.500 --> 23:00.900
One avocado slice.

23:00.900 --> 23:02.400
Two avocado slices!

23:02.400 --> 23:03.967
Elmo:
All done!

23:03.967 --> 23:07.433
Kid:
That's only two!
We need three! One more!

23:07.433 --> 23:12.133
Elmo:
Three avocado slices!
Check!

23:13.300 --> 23:16.400
A delicious quesadilla!

23:16.400 --> 23:19.433
Mm-mm-mm!
Just like the recipe said!

23:19.433 --> 23:21.600
Wow! We did it!

23:21.600 --> 23:24.900
Boy,
cooking is so much fun!

23:24.900 --> 23:29.066
Hey. That makes Elmo
wonder even more.

23:29.066 --> 23:31.934
Does Mr. Noodle
like to cook?

23:31.934 --> 23:33.433
Oh. Let's ask him, okay?

23:33.433 --> 23:36.533
Hey, Mr. Noodle!

23:36.533 --> 23:37.700
Oh, ho ho!

23:37.700 --> 23:39.633
Elmo and kids:
Hi, Mr. Noodle!

23:39.633 --> 23:42.000
Mr. Noodle,
do you like to cook?

23:43.266 --> 23:44.600
You do?

23:44.600 --> 23:48.133
Oh. Show us what you cook,
Mr. Noodle.

23:48.133 --> 23:49.600
Ooh!

23:49.600 --> 23:51.700
That's a big, empty pot,
Mr. Noodle,

23:51.700 --> 23:54.433
but what goes in it?

23:54.433 --> 23:56.133
A shoe?

23:56.133 --> 23:57.900
Kid:
A pot isn't for shoes.

23:57.900 --> 23:59.400
It's to cook in.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.600
Elmo:
Get your shoe out
of the pot, Mr. Noodle!

24:01.600 --> 24:04.200
No, no, no.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.200
Ooh! Spaghetti!

24:06.200 --> 24:07.967
Yum, yum, yum!

24:10.066 --> 24:13.266
Whoa, that's a lot
of spaghetti, Mr. Noodle.

24:13.266 --> 24:15.166
Whoa!

24:17.633 --> 24:19.633
And we're waiting,
we're waiting.

24:21.934 --> 24:24.333
Oh! It's ready!
It's cooked!

24:26.166 --> 24:28.033
Oh, boy!

24:28.033 --> 24:31.133
That's a long noodle,
Mr. Noodle.

24:31.133 --> 24:33.200
Thanks, Mr. Noodle.

24:33.200 --> 24:35.567
Bye-bye, Mr. Noodle.

24:35.567 --> 24:40.200

makes Elmo so happy,
