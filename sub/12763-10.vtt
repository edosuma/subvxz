00:01.000 --> 00:03.162
<i>Previously on Kyle XY:</i>

00:03.269 --> 00:04.634
What is it?

00:04.738 --> 00:06.672
It's you.

00:06.740 --> 00:09.004
1985?

00:09.075 --> 00:11.441
I found out his name.
The guy in the photo.

00:11.544 --> 00:13.273
Adam Baylin.

00:13.346 --> 00:16.042
Adam Baylin has been missing
for 20 years.

00:16.116 --> 00:19.483
You gotta stop asking questions.
Forget about the past.

00:19.552 --> 00:22.248
Because if you don't
they'll kill you, Kyle.

00:22.922 --> 00:26.688
781227 was scheduled
for termination two months ago.

00:26.793 --> 00:30.661
This company cannot afford to have
that subject loose in the outside world.

00:31.798 --> 00:33.891
- Kyle!
- It's all gonna be OK.

00:35.935 --> 00:38.870
I've got a great thing going,
and I'm not gonna ruin it.

00:38.938 --> 00:40.064
Great for you.

00:40.140 --> 00:42.370
Go out with Amanda,
tap Hilary on the side.

00:42.442 --> 00:45.878
I can't help feeling
that I've let you down.

00:45.945 --> 00:47.173
Let me down?

00:47.247 --> 00:50.182
You made me feel like I was your son.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.808
Noah, is that really you?

00:53.987 --> 00:55.147
Who are you?

00:56.056 --> 00:59.958
It's Mom.
We finally found you.

01:02.929 --> 01:07.491
The kids called from the car.
Apparently, he had a seizure.

01:07.600 --> 01:10.364
It's gonna be OK.
We're gonna figure this out.

01:10.437 --> 01:12.371
That's about what happened.

01:13.473 --> 01:15.441
It's all we've been talking about.

01:15.508 --> 01:19.410
<i>At a glance, anyone would believe
the Petersons and I were related.</i>

01:19.479 --> 01:22.209
<i>They'd say I had
her mouth and his chin.</i>

01:22.282 --> 01:25.410
<i>But I wanted more
than a passing resemblance.</i>

01:25.485 --> 01:27.851
<i>Instead of thinking
they could be my parents,</i>

01:27.921 --> 01:29.889
<i>I needed to feel that they were.</i>

01:29.956 --> 01:32.117
They look like nice people.

01:32.225 --> 01:34.284
What the hell kind of name is Noah?

01:34.360 --> 01:36.828
I can't believe you.
Kyle's getting hauled off.

01:36.896 --> 01:39.057
Can't you think
of something decent to say?

01:39.165 --> 01:43.261
It's not like I want him to go.
He doesn't even look like a Noah.

01:43.703 --> 01:46.604
Do you think they'll want
to take me home with them soon?

01:47.307 --> 01:48.604
Maybe.

01:50.610 --> 01:51.702
I don't know.

01:51.778 --> 01:54.611
We'd lived in Hong Kong
for two years when it happened.

01:54.681 --> 01:57.514
Five years ago Noah left for school
and never came home.

01:57.584 --> 02:02.078
We thought it was a kidnapping,
some sort of extortion scheme.

02:02.155 --> 02:05.784
- David's an executive for a bank.
- There was never a ransom call.

02:05.859 --> 02:08.157
There were no clues,
from the beginning.

02:08.228 --> 02:11.197
Still, we never stopped looking for him.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.765
We never stopped hoping.

02:13.833 --> 02:16.996
And finally, out of nowhere,

02:17.103 --> 02:19.435
a hit on a missing person Web site.

02:19.506 --> 02:23.465
We couldn't tell from the picture,
but after talking to the detective

02:23.576 --> 02:25.305
and now seeing him...

02:27.180 --> 02:29.944
I used to call him
my wandering wonder.

02:30.583 --> 02:33.211
Sharp, inquisitive.

02:33.286 --> 02:36.653
Studying everything, taking it all in.

02:37.357 --> 02:40.019
Kyle is... I'm sorry.

02:40.093 --> 02:43.221
- We're so used to calling him that.
- We understand.

02:43.296 --> 02:45.594
Kyle is special.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.190
And different in many ways.

02:48.268 --> 02:51.203
He was born with some physical defects.

02:51.271 --> 02:53.739
His organs weren't
all in the right place.

02:53.806 --> 02:56.366
Corrective surgeries
have made him as good as new,

02:56.476 --> 02:58.535
but without a bellybutton.

02:59.979 --> 03:03.415
- We have so many questions.
- So do we.

03:03.483 --> 03:05.212
Well, they'll have to wait.

03:05.285 --> 03:09.221
The hospital arranged some DNA tests
to verify paternity. In the meantime...

03:09.289 --> 03:12.520
We were told that Noah has no memory

03:12.592 --> 03:14.719
from the day before he was found.

03:14.794 --> 03:16.694
I put this photo album together.

03:16.763 --> 03:19.493
Thought it might jog some memories.

03:21.000 --> 03:27.074

03:37.083 --> 03:39.551
You said you had answers.

03:48.828 --> 03:52.286
<i>Foss! Listen to me.
I know you're there.</i>

03:53.600 --> 03:55.932
<i>Who are these people?</i>

04:22.762 --> 04:24.320
I have questions.

04:25.131 --> 04:27.429
- Go ahead.
- Where am I from?

04:28.568 --> 04:31.731
Well, let's see.
You were born in Manhattan.

04:31.804 --> 04:34.932
And from there we moved
around a little bit.

04:35.008 --> 04:37.772
DC, Connecticut, Hong Kong.

04:37.844 --> 04:40.608
- Do I have brothers or sisters?
- We only wanted one.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.841
- Pets?
- We're both allergic.

04:42.949 --> 04:47.181
- Kyle, slow down.
- Maybe if we tell you some stories.

04:48.388 --> 04:51.084
You remember the old claw foot tub?

04:51.157 --> 04:52.852
From the house in Connecticut?

04:53.559 --> 04:57.325
When we were moving to Hong Kong,
Noah kept insisting he didn't want to go

04:57.397 --> 05:01.766
because he didn't know what the tub
would be like. David, as a surprise,

05:01.834 --> 05:03.165
had the tub shipped.

05:03.236 --> 05:05.864
He jumped in it
as soon as we took it out of the crate.

05:05.938 --> 05:10.034
- Slept in it that night.
- And every night until...

05:13.846 --> 05:15.814
Is there anything else you want to ask?

05:15.915 --> 05:17.883
Yes. Who's Adam Baylin?

05:19.085 --> 05:21.952
- Doesn't sound familiar.
- Professor William Kern?

05:22.021 --> 05:24.581
- Who?
- This logo? Do you recognize it?

05:24.657 --> 05:26.989
- Kyle.
- No, they act like they know me.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.818
They can't tell me anything
to help me remember.

05:29.896 --> 05:34.526
They don't know why people are missing
or how these people are connected to me.

05:34.600 --> 05:40.300
It's a lot to take in. It seems like
for all of you, five years is just gone.

05:47.580 --> 05:50.140
Let's go, people.
God is waiting.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.609
You want to go
to Amanda's confirmation with me?

05:53.686 --> 05:56.314
Sure. Church is neat.

05:56.389 --> 05:58.755
And I never get a chance
to wear this suit.

05:58.858 --> 06:01.418
When do you ever wear that suit?

06:01.527 --> 06:04.553
And when did you start reeking
of my aftershave?

06:04.630 --> 06:07.121
- What's her name?
- OK.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.328
Maybe there's this girl named Ashleigh
that I met at a party.

06:10.403 --> 06:13.839
Maybe she goes to Holy Family
and sings in the choir.

06:13.906 --> 06:18.002
And maybe she finds
the scent of a man irresistible.

06:19.312 --> 06:21.803
Tuck in your shirt.
The Lord hates a slob.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.509
Watch yourself.
Church isn't supposed to be fun.

06:24.584 --> 06:26.814
Oh, is that why you never go?

06:37.663 --> 06:39.392
God, she's hot.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.202
Oh, my God, can I even say "God"?

06:44.937 --> 06:46.461
Sorry.

06:53.413 --> 06:57.907
<i>Everywhere I looked,
church provided unsettling contrasts.</i>

06:59.252 --> 07:02.949
<i>People whose beliefs encouraged
honesty also practiced betrayal.</i>

07:05.024 --> 07:07.652
<i>There was a lot about church
I didn't understand,</i>

07:07.727 --> 07:10.560
<i>but I did know that faith meant
believing in something,</i>

07:10.630 --> 07:12.461
<i>often without tangible proof.</i>

07:12.532 --> 07:15.899
<i>I wondered if I'd be able
to do the same with the Petersons</i>

07:15.968 --> 07:18.994
<i>and come to accept them wholeheartedly.</i>

07:19.071 --> 07:21.369
What's he putting on her head?

07:22.074 --> 07:24.508
Everyone else is being quiet, Josh.

07:24.577 --> 07:26.670
I think we should be quiet too.

07:32.885 --> 07:35.445
Did the church walls crumble
at the sight of you?

07:36.756 --> 07:38.280
Very funny.

07:41.561 --> 07:44.325
Yeah, I'd gotten used to Kyle
having no memories.

07:46.299 --> 07:50.201
It feels kind of strange to have
his whole life laid out before us.

07:50.269 --> 07:52.829
Well, he looks happy in these photos.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.032
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.707
You can't be fine.
I'm not fine.

08:00.780 --> 08:03.305
Since day one,
he's been searching for clues

08:03.382 --> 08:05.475
to who he is and where he comes from.

08:06.185 --> 08:08.085
And now he knows.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.884
For me to be upset
would just be selfish.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.522
Or human.

08:17.363 --> 08:18.921
I'm fine.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.113
I'm just so proud of her.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.217
Oh.

08:40.453 --> 08:44.014
- Look, it's our neighbor.
- Hi.

08:44.090 --> 08:45.955
- Hi.
- Hey, Kyle.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.890
Good to see you feeling better.

08:49.295 --> 08:50.819
Thanks.

08:51.664 --> 08:54.531
Amanda, I think we should go
and thank the bishop now.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.034
- We already thanked him.
- Amanda.

09:00.006 --> 09:02.065
- OK. God.
- Shh.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.478
Her mother is a piece of work.

09:07.179 --> 09:09.841
I think Amanda has
bigger problems right now.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.646
I know about Hilary.

09:15.821 --> 09:17.516
You can't tell her.

09:18.491 --> 09:20.118
I'm not the one who should.

09:22.361 --> 09:25.888
- Men are such dogs.
- Gee, thanks.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.730
You've proven yourself
to be moderately un-doglike.

09:30.803 --> 09:33.033
Amanda's the nicest girl
in the universe.

09:33.105 --> 09:35.130
How could he cheat on her?

09:35.207 --> 09:39.541
She's a nice girl who doesn't believe
in sex before marriage, and he's a guy.

09:39.612 --> 09:42.638
- That's hideous logic.
- But accurate.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.945
- Church sucks.
- News flash.

09:46.018 --> 09:49.351
- Did you get the DNA results?
- Not yet.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.152
The police run their plates?
Have they done anything

09:52.224 --> 09:54.351
to prove the Petersons
are who they say?

09:54.427 --> 09:56.088
They're not criminals, Declan.

09:56.162 --> 10:00.030
They're a nice, married couple
from Connecticut who lost their son.

10:03.369 --> 10:06.532
- I just want to make sure.
- He has a point.

10:06.639 --> 10:09.767
I mean, aliens can't just land
their craft on the front yard

10:09.842 --> 10:13.710
and get Kyle without drawing attention.
They hatched the perfect plan.

10:13.779 --> 10:17.442
We invite them into our home,
and they make off with our alien.

10:21.487 --> 10:23.045
What?

10:27.927 --> 10:29.792
You wanted to see me, Ms. Thatcher?

10:29.862 --> 10:33.559
Every day that subject 781227
remains alive,

10:33.633 --> 10:36.659
we risk someone
discovering his abilities.

10:36.736 --> 10:38.499
He's always surrounded by people.

10:38.604 --> 10:41.232
It makes it very complicated
to try to take him out.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.865
But I do have a plan in motion.

10:42.975 --> 10:46.433
Just find a moment when he's alone
and get rid of him.

10:48.314 --> 10:51.283
I do not want any evidence
of our experiment to exist

10:51.350 --> 10:53.978
outside the walls of this company.

11:02.428 --> 11:04.396
Let's think this through.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.965
You remember being
in a car on a rainy night.

11:07.033 --> 11:09.661
And seeing Tom Foss
kill Kern in the woods.

11:09.735 --> 11:12.898
- Then you woke up alone.
- With no memory of what just happened.

11:13.773 --> 11:15.468
No memories at all.

11:17.176 --> 11:20.009
We know Professor Kern
was connected to Adam Baylin,

11:20.079 --> 11:23.378
who looked just like me 20 years ago
before he disappeared.

11:24.183 --> 11:27.152
I'm also ruling out time travel
and aliens in pink goo.

11:27.253 --> 11:29.153
It's too ridiculous.

11:30.222 --> 11:32.952
And Adam Baylin drew a picture
of the keycard logo.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.720
Which you subconsciously drew.

11:34.794 --> 11:37.661
Which led me to a location
I couldn't identify.

11:37.730 --> 11:39.891
Then your supposed
real parents show up.

11:39.965 --> 11:42.934
With no idea of where I've been
for the past five years

11:43.002 --> 11:45.266
or why I can do the things I can do.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.571
I got nothing.

11:51.143 --> 11:53.270
But you're not a superhero, either.

11:55.114 --> 11:58.811
I wish more things would come back
to me. They're trapped in my head.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.375
I bet Tom Foss
could put those pieces together.

12:01.454 --> 12:04.719
We can't go near Foss.
It's too dangerous.

12:08.227 --> 12:11.719
You should have seen Charlie
all clean-cut and churchy,

12:11.797 --> 12:14.664
holding her hand
like a freaking choir boy.

12:15.935 --> 12:18.699
Too bad she can't make him sing
like I can.

12:18.804 --> 12:23.104
Hil, I hate to be all doom and gloomy,
but you know this can't end well, right?

12:24.043 --> 12:27.479
I know he doesn't want to hurt her
right now because she lost her dad,

12:27.546 --> 12:28.706
but I can wait.

12:28.814 --> 12:31.078
And what happens
if he dumps her for you?

12:31.150 --> 12:34.210
You're with a guy
who's cheating on his girlfriend.

12:34.286 --> 12:36.117
What's to say
he won't do that to you?

12:36.188 --> 12:38.713
How are you suddenly
a relationship expert?

12:38.791 --> 12:41.259
It's not like Declan's
Mr. Ideal Boyfriend.

12:41.327 --> 12:43.795
No, but weirdly enough,

12:45.164 --> 12:46.426
I trust him.

12:47.867 --> 12:50.631
- Turnaround of the century.
- Crazy, huh?

12:52.371 --> 12:54.066
But sweet.

12:56.509 --> 12:57.942
I'm happy for you.

12:59.812 --> 13:02.576
I didn't get a chance
to thank you for my present.

13:03.215 --> 13:05.706
It was really thoughtful.
Saint Colette is...

13:05.785 --> 13:08.413
Patron saint of people
who've lost a parent.

13:10.356 --> 13:11.323
Yeah.

13:14.760 --> 13:19.493
We haven't had the chance to talk about
what's happened to you since yesterday.

13:23.002 --> 13:24.560
You want to?

13:36.749 --> 13:38.114
You should be happy.

13:39.418 --> 13:40.680
You don't look happy.

13:43.055 --> 13:44.147
I'm not.

13:45.891 --> 13:50.123
Funny thing about my religion, there's
a saint for pretty much everything.

13:50.196 --> 13:53.131
Cab drivers, stomachaches, geese.

13:53.199 --> 13:55.895
There's even a patron saint
for bald people.

13:55.968 --> 13:59.131
Sometimes I wonder,
if everything's covered,

13:59.205 --> 14:02.504
then why do so many bad things
happen to people?

14:04.310 --> 14:08.178
I realized that everyone needs something
to get us through the bad stuff.

14:09.648 --> 14:11.206
So I need a saint.

14:13.552 --> 14:17.420
The patron saint of lost pasts
and confusing futures.

14:19.491 --> 14:21.391
Any idea where I can find one?

14:25.965 --> 14:27.330
Why are they coming again?

14:27.399 --> 14:31.096
Nothing's triggered recognition.
The more they get to know each other,

14:31.170 --> 14:33.195
the more hope
of Kyle remembering them.

14:33.272 --> 14:35.638
Unless there's nothing to remember.

14:35.741 --> 14:39.177
Josh has spun an alien conspiracy theory
of epic proportions.

14:39.245 --> 14:42.373
This is difficult, but we have
to start dealing with the idea

14:42.448 --> 14:44.473
that Kyle might be leaving us.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.744
What's the matter?

14:49.822 --> 14:52.188
I just got off the phone
with the hospital.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.618
The DNA is a match.

15:00.132 --> 15:02.430
Well, now we know.

15:07.239 --> 15:08.536
I'm not going with them.

15:10.309 --> 15:12.277
Damn straight.

15:12.378 --> 15:15.541
Kyle, of course
we don't want to lose you,

15:15.648 --> 15:19.482
- but it's not that easy.
- They're your family.

15:22.688 --> 15:24.519
You're my family.

15:26.759 --> 15:30.024
I don't care what the test says,
they're strangers to me.

15:31.030 --> 15:35.330
How can I go live with them
when you're the only family I know?

15:47.613 --> 15:49.478
- Kyle, wait.
- Honey.

15:59.024 --> 16:02.118
<i>I'd read the story of the father
who sacrificed his son</i>

16:02.194 --> 16:04.526
<i>for the good of all mankind.</i>

16:04.596 --> 16:06.427
<i>I wondered if having faith</i>

16:06.498 --> 16:09.956
<i>meant making our own sacrifices
for the good of others.</i>

16:25.517 --> 16:28.884
You can kneel if you want to.
Helps sometimes.

16:29.788 --> 16:32.018
Gets you in the mood to pray.

16:35.027 --> 16:37.291
I've never prayed before.

16:37.363 --> 16:39.058
It's simple.

16:39.131 --> 16:42.066
It's like telling your troubles
to a friendly ear.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.735
I'm in search of a saint.

16:49.942 --> 16:52.035
Well, you picked a good place.

16:54.947 --> 16:57.313
What do you need a saint for?

17:01.387 --> 17:03.821
I don't know where I belong.

17:03.889 --> 17:06.221
I don't know where I come from.

17:08.260 --> 17:11.229
But I'm supposed to go there,
wherever it is,

17:11.329 --> 17:13.388
with people I don't know.

17:14.032 --> 17:15.694
That's a lot to handle.

17:17.903 --> 17:20.234
I don't know what to do.

17:24.042 --> 17:27.137
And I'm not sure how any of this here
is supposed to help.

17:32.017 --> 17:34.986
Well, whether or not
you consider yourself a believer,

17:35.087 --> 17:37.783
there's someone out there who made you,

17:37.856 --> 17:41.223
who cares about you very much.

17:41.326 --> 17:43.294
In the midst of a confusing situation,

17:43.362 --> 17:45.592
you may not be able to see
or appreciate him,

17:45.664 --> 17:47.632
but he's there

17:47.699 --> 17:51.066
and he wants you to have the answers
to all of your questions.

17:53.205 --> 17:54.968
When?

17:55.074 --> 17:56.598
When the time is right.

18:26.738 --> 18:30.299
<i>I didn't know where I was
or who had taken me.</i>

18:30.409 --> 18:34.175
<i>But it seemed the danger I had
been warned of had finally come to pass.</i>

18:36.949 --> 18:39.816
<i>The memories that haunted me
came flooding in again.</i>

18:41.386 --> 18:43.718
<i>Was I remembering my past?</i>

18:46.091 --> 18:49.254
<i>Or was history repeating itself?</i>

19:00.706 --> 19:03.072
Julia and I prayed for his safety.

19:03.175 --> 19:06.804
We were thankful he was taken in
by people like you and Nicole.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.172
Are you a religious family?

19:10.249 --> 19:12.217
I take it you're not.

19:12.284 --> 19:17.051
Well, I was raised to be,
but it got away from me over the years.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.421
Yeah, we never used to be either,
but when you lose a child,

19:20.492 --> 19:24.189
somehow you need
a kind of higher power for comfort.

19:24.263 --> 19:26.629
I can't blame him for being scared.

19:26.732 --> 19:30.361
We're strangers to him.
And he's like a stranger to us.

19:32.538 --> 19:35.006
Maybe he's not
the only one who's scared.

19:35.073 --> 19:38.372
What if those five years
have changed him somehow?

19:38.443 --> 19:43.312
- They've changed me.
- He's still the same boy you knew.

19:43.382 --> 19:45.612
No matter what happened.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.845
He's still got a sweet tooth.

19:47.953 --> 19:50.513
I caught him putting
Sour Patch Kids on his cereal.

19:50.622 --> 19:52.886
- Oh, my.
- Yeah.

19:52.958 --> 19:56.325
And he's funny.
You know, not just his humor,

19:56.428 --> 19:59.454
but the way he looks at the world.

19:59.531 --> 20:03.968
I mean, he can turn everything
and show it to you in a whole new way.

20:04.036 --> 20:07.005
And he's got such a strong sense
of what's right,

20:07.105 --> 20:12.065
and he's so quick to learn and
so eager to connect with other people.

20:15.013 --> 20:17.573
Like he's connected with you.

20:18.784 --> 20:20.342
With all of us.

20:22.654 --> 20:25.214
<i>Once again
I was in a familiar place,</i>

20:25.324 --> 20:26.985
<i>where my story began.</i>

20:27.759 --> 20:32.093
<i>But suddenly, like a flash,
the whole story fell into place.</i>

20:32.531 --> 20:35.364
- Don't do this.
- Zzyzx ordered you to exterminate him.

20:35.434 --> 20:38.699
- I can't let either of you walk away.
- You were Baylin's mentor.

20:38.770 --> 20:41.034
He trusted you.
Now you're working for them.

20:41.106 --> 20:44.405
Baylin gave up any claim on the boy
when he turned on the company.

20:44.476 --> 20:46.341
They want the boy dead.

20:56.221 --> 21:00.988
<i>I finally had a piece of the truth.
Now it was time to get the rest.</i>

21:01.093 --> 21:04.221
It's all right! It's all right!
Settle down. Listen to me.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.128
It's OK.

21:09.501 --> 21:11.969
I'm sorry about the chloroform.

21:12.938 --> 21:16.101
I tried to get the jump on you
before and it wasn't pretty, so...

21:17.442 --> 21:21.276
I remember what happened... with Kern.

21:22.314 --> 21:26.444
The two of you were talking about
Adam Baylin, something called Zzyzx.

21:26.518 --> 21:30.079
Is that connected with the location
I discovered in Baylin's papers?

21:30.155 --> 21:31.816
The logo?

21:33.358 --> 21:36.521
This is why I warned you
to stop asking questions.

21:36.595 --> 21:39.086
You didn't bring me out here
to lecture me.

21:40.232 --> 21:42.097
- No.
- Then why?

21:44.870 --> 21:47.600
Because I thought
it would help you remember.

21:49.374 --> 21:50.671
Did you hear something?

21:52.944 --> 21:54.309
What?

22:01.887 --> 22:05.254
Get down! Get down! Go! Go!

22:08.226 --> 22:10.592
Are you all right?
Come on! Give me your arm!

22:18.570 --> 22:21.733
Go! Get in! Get in!

22:24.376 --> 22:26.503
You don't know how to drive.

22:26.578 --> 22:27.840
Hold on.

22:30.615 --> 22:32.082
Go!

22:50.769 --> 22:51.929
Hey.

22:52.804 --> 22:56.137
- What are you doing here?
- Driving through the neighborhood

22:56.208 --> 23:00.076
and felt the strains of downer
lesbian music emanating from your house.

23:01.279 --> 23:03.042
Thought you might need a boost.

23:03.148 --> 23:06.174
Let me guess, you think
I should heal my pain through sex?

23:06.251 --> 23:09.743
I was going for a heavy-duty
mack session, but if you insist...

23:13.225 --> 23:17.059
It freaks me out, I spent so much time
not caring if Kyle was here or not...

23:18.330 --> 23:21.595
...and now that he might leave...
- He's not going anywhere.

23:23.101 --> 23:25.569
- You sound like Josh.
- He's got a life here.

23:26.938 --> 23:30.203
A trippy, no-memory, messed-up life,

23:30.275 --> 23:32.709
but it's still a life.

23:33.578 --> 23:35.205
He's not gonna throw that away

23:35.280 --> 23:38.306
for two people he has no memory
of ever knowing.

23:40.152 --> 23:41.881
How can you be so sure?

23:45.590 --> 23:48.150
Because the other ending
to that story's...

23:48.226 --> 23:50.922
It's not something
I'm willing to accept.

24:00.472 --> 24:02.804
You should've let me
take you to the hospital.

24:02.874 --> 24:05.434
I'll take care of it.
Get out of here. Go.

24:05.544 --> 24:08.809
I'm not getting out of this car
until you've told me everything.

24:08.880 --> 24:11.212
You know most of it already.

24:12.484 --> 24:14.247
We were in the woods.

24:15.687 --> 24:19.521
And we were surprised by Kern.

24:20.525 --> 24:23.494
And I killed him
because he was gonna kill you.

24:24.629 --> 24:28.929
By the time I was done
getting rid of the body, you'd woken up

24:29.000 --> 24:32.766
and you wandered into the city
and got put in juvenile detention.

24:34.573 --> 24:37.269
Once Nicole Trager took you in,

24:38.376 --> 24:41.243
I just figured it was smarter to...

24:42.848 --> 24:44.611
...keep an eye on.

24:44.716 --> 24:46.081
Tell me more.

24:46.184 --> 24:48.618
Tell me why people want me dead,

24:48.687 --> 24:51.713
why that test said
David and Julia Peterson were my parents

24:51.790 --> 24:54.554
when I don't remember
anything about them.

24:55.427 --> 24:59.261
Why don't I remember anything before
that night in the woods with Kern?

25:02.000 --> 25:04.833
OK, I'll tell you.

25:04.903 --> 25:06.962
Should we be worried
he's not back?

25:07.038 --> 25:09.268
I think he got overwhelmed.
We'll talk to him.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.706
We can try again tomorrow.

25:10.809 --> 25:12.174
- That would be great.
- OK.

25:12.244 --> 25:15.145
- OK, thanks a lot for your time.
- You're welcome.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.574
- Kyle.
- Noah.

25:19.751 --> 25:22.777
Where you been? Doing OK?

25:22.854 --> 25:27.018
<i>My mind was racing with the
information I'd just learned from Foss.</i>

25:27.092 --> 25:31.358
<i>Foss, my patron saint of lost pasts
and confusing futures.</i>

25:31.429 --> 25:33.397
<i>Everyone was there in front of me.</i>

25:34.633 --> 25:39.161
<i>The family who took me in and the family
who wanted to take me home.</i>

25:39.237 --> 25:43.173
<i>And right then,
I knew exactly what I had to do.</i>

25:44.142 --> 25:45.370
I remember.

25:47.579 --> 25:49.103
Mom.

25:50.715 --> 25:52.273
Dad.

25:54.486 --> 25:55.953
I remember you.

26:12.671 --> 26:15.902
I remember the vacation we had
when I was nine to Hawaii.

26:17.075 --> 26:19.305
I'd never seen a palm tree before.

26:20.245 --> 26:24.272
And you took me to the science museum
where they had the Whispering Corridors.

26:24.816 --> 26:27.546
And we went sailing near the waterfall,

26:27.619 --> 26:30.179
on the boat with the rainbow sail.

26:30.288 --> 26:34.054
And every night at the hotel,
I'd order the same thing for dessert.

26:34.125 --> 26:36.787
Banana split, hold the banana.

26:37.896 --> 26:41.559
Can you tell us what happened to you?
Where you've been all this time?

26:42.567 --> 26:43.727
Still a blank.

26:46.972 --> 26:51.739
Well, once you get home,
I'm sure you can find a new therapist

26:51.810 --> 26:54.711
who can help him recover
even more of his memory.

26:54.779 --> 26:59.079
- Why can't you still be his therapist?
- Yeah, you know him better than anyone.

26:59.150 --> 27:01.118
No offense.

27:01.219 --> 27:03.187
The Petersons live in Connecticut.

27:06.224 --> 27:08.988
So how soon before you leave?

27:09.060 --> 27:12.427
Well, um,
we don't want to rush anything.

27:14.132 --> 27:16.191
I'll be ready to go by tomorrow.

27:32.817 --> 27:35.911
Now that I know, I'm ready.

27:37.389 --> 27:40.552
I can't believe he's leaving
before I got to make out with him.

27:41.960 --> 27:43.450
Kidding.

27:44.629 --> 27:46.563
We should be happy for him.

27:46.631 --> 27:49.691
Keep telling yourself that,
Sister Sunshine.

27:49.768 --> 27:52.328
I thought this was supposed
to be a goodbye party.

27:52.404 --> 27:53.837
Woo-hoo.

27:57.809 --> 27:59.174
I just don't get it.

27:59.277 --> 28:03.441
You went from savant amnesia victim
to banana split guy in, like, two hours?

28:03.548 --> 28:08.178
- It all just came rushing back.
- Dude, I put myself out for you.

28:08.253 --> 28:11.347
I kept your secrets,
almost screwed things up with Lori.

28:12.223 --> 28:16.523
I did everything to help you get to the
bottom of the mystery and now it's done?

28:16.594 --> 28:18.494
Yes.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.692
There's something else going on here.

28:21.766 --> 28:25.862
- Something you're not telling me about.
- You've proven you can keep my secrets.

28:25.937 --> 28:30.169
If there was anything, don't you think
I'd find a way to bring you in on it?

28:32.110 --> 28:33.577
This sucks.

28:36.114 --> 28:37.411
Oh, whoa.

28:37.482 --> 28:39.712
Whoa, did you two
break up or something?

28:43.421 --> 28:46.515
All right. Look, man.
I know you think I'm a bad guy.

28:47.058 --> 28:51.154
It's just, I know where Amanda stands
on the sex thing.

28:51.229 --> 28:53.789
Look, I respect her for it, I do.

28:53.898 --> 28:57.857
You know, I would give anything
for the self-control to wait for her.

28:57.969 --> 29:01.234
I mean, this whole thing with Hilary,
it's just physical.

29:01.306 --> 29:04.139
It has nothing to do
with how much I love Amanda.

29:06.411 --> 29:07.935
Great.

29:08.346 --> 29:10.405
It's OK, I understand.

29:11.049 --> 29:12.141
You have needs.

29:12.851 --> 29:14.580
I have needs too.

29:15.420 --> 29:18.116
Right now, I need to do this.

29:26.164 --> 29:28.894
Don't judge me. I've seen
the way you look at Amanda.

29:28.967 --> 29:30.400
You're dying to tell her.

29:30.468 --> 29:32.368
I'm leaving in a few hours.

29:33.404 --> 29:36.373
The only thing I want
is to know that after I'm gone,

29:36.474 --> 29:39.739
she'll be surrounded
by trustworthy, honest and kind people.

29:39.811 --> 29:42.507
Because that's exactly
the kind of person she is.

29:49.854 --> 29:51.947
- Bye, guys.
- Where are you off to?

29:52.023 --> 29:54.321
- Out.
- I'm sure whatever it is, it can wait.

29:54.392 --> 29:57.850
- Kyle will be leaving soon.
- Shouldn't you call him Noah Peterson?

29:57.929 --> 30:00.489
- That's his real name.
- Hey! Now that's not cool.

30:00.598 --> 30:02.031
You get back here, Josh!

30:02.100 --> 30:06.662
Stephen, he's protecting himself
from some strong emotions now.

30:06.771 --> 30:08.432
He shouldn't be running off.

30:08.506 --> 30:11.270
Well, just let him deal with it
in his own way.

30:20.118 --> 30:21.949
Stephen?

30:22.020 --> 30:23.544
What, Nicole?

30:24.522 --> 30:26.854
Can't I be just a little bit upset?

30:26.925 --> 30:30.190
Yeah, Kyle's going off to his home.
That's where he belongs.

30:31.029 --> 30:33.259
Doesn't make it any easier.

30:39.604 --> 30:43.040
Through this whole thing,
you haven't faltered.

30:43.107 --> 30:44.870
Not once.

30:44.943 --> 30:48.106
Well, in my line of work,
this is what you hope for.

30:48.179 --> 30:51.342
Most foster care stories
don't have happy endings.

30:52.183 --> 30:54.515
For Kyle to be placed
with his real parents

30:54.586 --> 30:56.247
and his memories coming back...

30:57.188 --> 30:59.156
...I couldn't be happier.

31:01.326 --> 31:02.486
Well.

31:04.028 --> 31:06.292
That's why you're my higher power.

31:14.939 --> 31:16.600
You OK?

31:16.674 --> 31:18.972
I'm totally not crying.

31:20.345 --> 31:23.212
Water-proof mascara rules.

31:23.281 --> 31:24.748
What happened?

31:24.816 --> 31:26.283
You know the story.

31:26.351 --> 31:28.911
Homewrecker-in-training
tragically rejected

31:28.987 --> 31:31.547
by the heir to the cheater's throne.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.885
You can say you told me so.

31:35.693 --> 31:38.628
What kind of homewrecker's friend
would that make me?

31:42.834 --> 31:44.768
Put it behind you.

31:44.836 --> 31:47.930
One day, you are gonna meet
a smart, faithful guy...

31:48.006 --> 31:51.373
- Doctor.
... who will whisk you off your feet.

31:51.476 --> 31:54.741
- In his convertible.
- And you'll live happily ever after.

31:54.812 --> 31:57.576
Until the magnificent
divorce settlement.

31:57.682 --> 31:59.309
Exactly.

32:01.452 --> 32:04.012
Have you seen Charlie?
He just disappeared.

32:05.256 --> 32:08.123
He's inside. Cleaning up.

32:11.663 --> 32:13.961
I can't believe you're leaving.

32:15.033 --> 32:16.728
I'll see you again, though.

32:16.801 --> 32:19.463
It's not like forever, right?

32:19.537 --> 32:21.698
I don't want it to be.

32:23.574 --> 32:25.132
OK.

32:25.743 --> 32:27.301
Then no goodbyes.

32:29.580 --> 32:31.741
No goodbyes.

32:31.816 --> 32:35.183
Just, like... see you.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.446
See you.

32:58.276 --> 33:00.005
Come on.

33:15.526 --> 33:17.619
Need any help?

33:18.696 --> 33:20.459
I'm not taking much.

33:25.069 --> 33:27.765
I bet Stephen will be glad
to have his workshop back.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.568
I don't know.

33:29.640 --> 33:33.007
He may want to leave it this way
in case you want to come visit.

33:33.111 --> 33:35.079
That would be nice.

33:37.415 --> 33:39.144
You're not taking these?

33:40.985 --> 33:42.680
Something to remember us by?

33:45.156 --> 33:46.521
I'll draw new ones.

33:51.329 --> 33:56.164
Kyle, if Josh doesn't make it home
to say goodbye, it's not because...

33:56.234 --> 33:57.724
I understand.

34:13.384 --> 34:14.476
Thanks.

34:16.387 --> 34:18.411
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:18.489 --> 34:20.719
Come for a real goodbye?

34:20.792 --> 34:22.453
Yeah, you know,

34:22.527 --> 34:25.257
I don't want him to leave
with me all mad at him.

34:25.329 --> 34:28.821
- Totally un-doglike.
- Don't make a thing out of it.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.389
Out of what?

34:30.467 --> 34:33.335
The fact that you turned me
into a good guy.

34:33.404 --> 34:34.735
I have?

34:34.806 --> 34:38.639
What, Trager, you think all this
sensitive crap comes naturally?

34:38.708 --> 34:40.233
Get real.

34:41.579 --> 34:43.547
I feel like we're having a moment.

34:44.549 --> 34:47.518
I guess that's what happens
when you're in a relationship.

34:48.518 --> 34:50.214
Yeah.

34:50.288 --> 34:52.848
- Horrible, right?
- Awful.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.588
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:02.900 --> 35:04.561
We're all set here.

35:14.312 --> 35:17.475
- So you're finally out of here?
- Yep.

35:20.785 --> 35:24.653
After all that, you're just
a regular kid with normal parents.

35:24.722 --> 35:26.451
Apparently.

35:29.227 --> 35:31.286
I liked you better as an alien.

35:33.431 --> 35:36.195
Don't worry. I still got
a few alien tricks up my sleeve.

35:53.184 --> 35:54.481
Later.

35:57.054 --> 35:58.180
Later.

36:09.233 --> 36:12.396
- Thanks for everything.
- Take care, kid.

36:30.388 --> 36:32.879
We'll call you every day.

36:46.604 --> 36:47.969
Ready?

36:48.072 --> 36:49.733
Ready.

37:01.285 --> 37:02.377
Declan.

37:03.721 --> 37:05.211
I left a few things for you.

37:06.090 --> 37:07.853
They're in my room.

37:08.726 --> 37:10.421
Thanks, man.

38:29.273 --> 38:32.299
<i>I remember the vacation
we had in Hawaii when I was nine.</i>

38:33.611 --> 38:35.977
<i>I had never seen a palm tree before.</i>

38:39.483 --> 38:43.647
<i>And you took me to the science museum
where they had the Whispering Corridors.</i>

38:47.758 --> 38:49.419
And we went sailing,

38:49.493 --> 38:52.860
by the waterfall
on the boat with the rainbow sail.

38:56.233 --> 38:58.292
<i>You've proven you can keep my secrets.</i>

38:58.369 --> 39:02.135
<i>If there was anything, don't you think
I'd find a way to bring you in on it?</i>

39:02.239 --> 39:03.900
What you got there?

39:11.749 --> 39:14.115
You two are very good liars.

39:15.753 --> 39:17.311
It's our job.

39:18.122 --> 39:21.683
- Banana split, hold the banana.
- Had to seem authentic.

39:21.759 --> 39:23.624
And the DNA test.

39:23.694 --> 39:26.959
We were provided
the appropriate genetic material.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.362
From who?

39:28.733 --> 39:30.826
Oh, you'll meet him soon.

39:40.177 --> 39:41.542
It's done.

39:41.645 --> 39:43.738
<i>Zzyzx will come after you, you know.</i>

39:44.482 --> 39:46.848
Rebecca Thatcher
will make it her mission.

39:46.917 --> 39:48.851
Yeah.

39:48.919 --> 39:52.252
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll be ready.

39:52.323 --> 39:53.551
What did you tell him?

39:53.624 --> 39:56.593
Go with the Petersons to keep
the Tragers out of danger,

39:56.660 --> 39:59.720
and I'd send him to somebody
that could tell him everything.

39:59.797 --> 40:02.288
<i>Good. I'll be waiting.</i>

40:17.348 --> 40:19.976
Tell me more.
Tell me why people want me dead,

40:20.050 --> 40:23.019
why that test said
David and Julia Peterson were my parents

40:23.120 --> 40:25.281
when I don't remember
anything about them.

40:26.590 --> 40:30.219
Why don't I remember anything before
that night in the woods with Kern?

40:31.962 --> 40:35.591
OK, I'll tell you. You don't remember
anything before that night

40:35.666 --> 40:37.998
because there's nothing to remember.

40:40.070 --> 40:41.765
What do you mean?

40:43.040 --> 40:44.564
Before that night,

40:45.943 --> 40:49.777
for all intents and purposes, you...

40:52.416 --> 40:54.247
You didn't exist.

41:02.493 --> 41:04.461
I assume the news isn't good.

41:04.528 --> 41:07.759
According to records, the boy's
been returned to his birth parents.

41:07.832 --> 41:10.460
That's amusing,
considering he doesn't have any.

41:10.534 --> 41:12.764
I tried to find out who they are,

41:12.837 --> 41:15.806
but the paper trail led
to a series of dead ends.

41:15.906 --> 41:18.272
As though he disappeared
without a trace.

41:18.342 --> 41:20.276
Not entirely.

41:23.080 --> 41:25.640
I have an idea who's behind all of this.

41:35.326 --> 41:36.987
Where are we?

41:37.061 --> 41:40.360
All we were told was to bring you here.

41:59.583 --> 42:02.051
It's good to see you again, Kyle.

42:03.687 --> 42:05.587
I'm Adam Baylin.

42:08.726 --> 42:10.387
What do you want from me?

42:10.461 --> 42:12.725
What would you like to know?

42:13.731 --> 42:14.891
Everything.

42:21.071 --> 42:23.369
Then you should come with me.

42:32.249 --> 42:35.707
Do you think they'll actually tell him
where he came from?

42:35.786 --> 42:39.722
That he was nothing more than
a scientific experiment? A failed one?

42:39.790 --> 42:42.520
Well, Baylin might disagree
with your assessment.

42:43.527 --> 42:45.392
With being a failure?

42:45.462 --> 42:49.728
After all, the boy did what neither of
you intended him to do when you started.

42:50.901 --> 42:53.461
He survived in the outside world.

42:53.571 --> 42:58.031
I'll take care of 781227
and Adam Baylin.

43:01.378 --> 43:04.905
In the meantime,
I've run the diagnostics.

43:07.952 --> 43:12.719
781228 is in excellent condition.
