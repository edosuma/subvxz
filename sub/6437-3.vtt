WEBVTT

00:05.214 --> 00:08.081
You brokered the sale of a woman
from the house of Batiatus,

00:08.258 --> 00:11.591
the mark of the domina
on the back of her shoulder.

00:11.762 --> 00:12.751
Where is she?

00:12.930 --> 00:14.921
Spartacus:
We will find her, brother,

00:15.098 --> 00:16.963
and see everyone
that has kept her from your arms

00:17.142 --> 00:19.098
to the afterlife.

00:19.269 --> 00:23.103
We will see the Romans bleed
for taking us as dogs.

00:23.273 --> 00:25.229
Spartacus is enemy to us both.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.891
The man takes habit of slipping
through your fingers.

00:28.070 --> 00:30.777
What moves you
to certainty of victory?

00:30.948 --> 00:32.108
Because the gods themselves
will it.

00:32.282 --> 00:34.443
May the gods bless you.

00:36.995 --> 00:40.158
There is but one place
for an animal without honor.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.199
You.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.334
I come bearing a gift...

00:46.505 --> 00:49.963
that shall set you upon path
to the fall of Spartacus.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.501
(theme music playing )

00:58.642 --> 01:01.133
(wheels clanking )

01:11.113 --> 01:13.695
( chains rattling )

01:13.865 --> 01:16.356
(woman crying )

01:20.289 --> 01:23.281
Quiet your fucking bleating!

01:23.458 --> 01:26.495
Still yourself.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.410
This how you came for the mine,

01:28.589 --> 01:30.875
by not heeding fucking command?

01:31.049 --> 01:32.550
( clatter)

01:45.105 --> 01:47.016
(slaves yelling )

01:48.108 --> 01:49.439
See yourselves free.

01:55.407 --> 01:57.443
(yells)

02:27.731 --> 02:29.346
You favor clever strategy.

02:29.524 --> 02:30.934
Fuck the man from behind.

02:31.109 --> 02:32.360
(Agron chuckles)

02:38.158 --> 02:39.989
A good start to the day.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.526
Crixus:
I would see it built upon.

02:42.704 --> 02:45.662
I seek a woman named Naevia.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.949
She was cast out
from the House of Batiatus

02:49.127 --> 02:50.333
before its fall.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.711
Batiatus?

02:52.881 --> 02:54.496
You are Spartacus?

02:56.259 --> 02:57.248
I am Crixus.

02:57.427 --> 03:00.169
Spartacus stands the fool
beside me.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.473
The woman he seeks
is of rare beauty,

03:04.643 --> 03:06.099
the mark of her domina
upon her back.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.475
She was carried from...

03:07.646 --> 03:09.637
Spartacus tells a sword
becomes lighter in time.

03:09.815 --> 03:13.228
It is a heavy thing
to rob a man of life.

03:13.402 --> 03:14.983
Less so that of a Roman shit.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.484
Stay close by.

03:16.655 --> 03:18.862
I will help shoulder weight
until we can--

03:19.032 --> 03:20.568
( gasps )

03:20.742 --> 03:22.482
The girl, Naevia...

03:22.661 --> 03:24.526
her fate, known to me.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.785
Speak it then.

03:25.956 --> 03:28.823
Spare a horse and my life.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.160
Speak.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.075
They add to our number,
yet not my cause.

03:32.254 --> 03:33.243
We will find her.

03:33.422 --> 03:34.753
Words you have
spoken many times,

03:34.923 --> 03:36.083
still ignored by the gods.

03:36.258 --> 03:37.998
( slaver screams )

03:42.514 --> 03:44.379
The man, he spoke of your woman.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.048
What did he say?

03:46.226 --> 03:47.432
Find fucking voice.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.012
Ag ron: Dead.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.476
Naevia is dead.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.331
Mira: I cannot believe
she is gone.

04:11.501 --> 04:14.834
The gods again turn from those
most worthy of blessing.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.101
- I hold no love for the man.
- ( Crixus screaming )

04:39.279 --> 04:40.894
Yet it tears heart
to see him so.

04:43.867 --> 04:46.108
How did she meet her end?

04:46.286 --> 04:48.698
Naevia was put to cart
for Lucania,

04:48.872 --> 04:50.737
having served purpose
for Batiatus' ambition.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.827
She perished in the mines?

04:53.001 --> 04:55.162
She gave life in passage,

04:55.337 --> 04:57.293
from injuries
borne of mistreatment.

04:58.590 --> 04:59.921
Death a kindness then,

05:00.091 --> 05:02.298
to be spared such a fate.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.759
Kindness only to the one taken.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.921
(yelling continues)

05:09.476 --> 05:11.432
(yelling echoes)

05:11.603 --> 05:13.093
( flesh sizzles )

05:15.899 --> 05:17.981
The man yet stands mute.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.358
This is what you would offer me
to gain favor?

05:20.529 --> 05:23.487
A statue that bleeds?

05:23.657 --> 05:25.443
Oenomaus believes himself
a man of honor.

05:25.617 --> 05:28.450
Pain alone will not move him
to betray his brothers.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.702
And I know the man well.

05:30.872 --> 05:31.861
Given over to my hands--

05:32.040 --> 05:33.075
Oh, do not think
I've forgotten

05:33.250 --> 05:36.868
what your hands
are capable of, slave.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.661
Or how they aided Batiatus

05:39.840 --> 05:41.626
in tethering me to this house.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.542
I but did
as my dominus commanded,

05:44.719 --> 05:46.926
absent thought of refusal,

05:47.097 --> 05:49.008
as I would
faithfully serve you now

05:49.182 --> 05:50.888
in seeing Spartacus
brought to his end.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.845
You speak of loyalties,

05:53.019 --> 05:56.136
yet the mark of Batiatus
brings allegiance to question.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.890
A blight upon flesh

06:01.069 --> 06:04.232
forever mocking
more noble intentions.

06:04.406 --> 06:05.896
Prove them...

06:08.618 --> 06:11.781
and live to see
if you are of further use.

06:21.965 --> 06:23.125
Your will,

06:24.467 --> 06:26.003
my hands.

06:28.346 --> 06:30.257
(grunting)

06:39.024 --> 06:40.480
You must be patient.

06:40.650 --> 06:41.981
The gods would not
deliver Oenomaus,

06:42.152 --> 06:43.483
only to mock us
with his silence.

06:43.653 --> 06:46.269
The sum of my doubts does
not lie with the gods alone.

06:46.448 --> 06:48.530
It's equally shared
with their messenger.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.531
( laughter)

06:53.288 --> 06:56.155
Ah. Here is our man.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.665
Courteous to finally
acknowledge our presence.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.826
Apologies.
l was unaware of your arrival.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.744
The fault is mine,

07:02.923 --> 07:05.005
between happy reunion
with father

07:05.175 --> 07:08.292
and plying Varinius
for news of Rome.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.301
Is this the lanista's wife,

07:10.472 --> 07:12.804
the one they whisper of
in the streets?

07:12.974 --> 07:14.555
Lucretia.

07:16.144 --> 07:19.261
To find you alive
is a blessing from Olympus.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.021
lam but its humble instrument.

07:22.192 --> 07:23.773
You're overly modest.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.354
To have survived such horrors,

07:25.528 --> 07:28.520
Jupiter himself must have
taken note of your worth.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.785
Varinius comes to present games.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.786
- Games?
- Two weeks of blood and sport

07:35.956 --> 07:37.492
to move this city
from heavy thought

07:37.666 --> 07:40.658
of Spartacus yet untamed.

07:40.835 --> 07:44.669
It shall be glorious spectacle,
made more so

07:44.839 --> 07:46.830
by your men presented
in opening celebration.

07:47.008 --> 07:50.216
The sight of them coupled
with Lucretia in the pulvinus

07:50.387 --> 07:53.345
shall help calm the citizenry.

07:53.515 --> 07:57.099
An honor that I
would happily oblige,

07:57.268 --> 08:00.635
were they not otherwise
occupied in the south.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.725
Do they draw any closer
to their goal?

08:02.899 --> 08:05.231
Or does Spartacus
yet elude them,

08:05.402 --> 08:07.233
as I heard he did
in the market?

08:09.364 --> 08:12.401
Perhaps Seppius' men
could march in your games.

08:12.575 --> 08:15.738
It's well known you hold
considerable sway with them.

08:15.912 --> 08:19.825
Seppius' men do not carry
the seal of Rome as your men do.

08:22.293 --> 08:23.624
Show good Varinius to wine

08:23.795 --> 08:25.911
and enticing view
of the city below.

08:26.089 --> 08:28.000
Varinius:
I would voice no argument.

08:28.174 --> 08:31.462
Come then. I shall
see you properly attended.

08:38.309 --> 08:41.437
Varinius is admired
within the Senate,

08:41.604 --> 08:43.560
a thing to be
carefully considered

08:43.732 --> 08:45.597
before words fly
from errant fucking tongue.

08:45.775 --> 08:48.152
- Do | not stand his equal?
- ln title only.

08:48.319 --> 08:50.731
They think you
an incompetent child,

08:50.905 --> 08:53.567
unable to wipe clean
his own shit.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.408
So a show of respect
towards a fellow praetor

08:57.579 --> 09:01.071
would be wise step
towards quietening doubt, hmm?

09:02.125 --> 09:03.990
Not only among the Senate.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.589
Capua to the north.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.125
Our current position, here.

09:13.303 --> 09:16.716
To the east, Vesuvius.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.505
Strong position to make camp.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.969
Within striking distance
of Pompeii to the south.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.099
Or Neapolis to the northwest.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.018
Prison ships often
empty at its ports,

09:28.193 --> 09:30.354
vomiting men
to be sold into slavery,

09:30.528 --> 09:32.484
as my brother and l were
a lifetime ago.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.651
l was carried
across the Adriatic

09:35.825 --> 09:38.202
to the eastern seaboard.
I know little of Neapolis.

09:38.369 --> 09:40.030
There are fighting men
brought to its shores?

09:40.205 --> 09:41.695
Captured in foreign wars.

09:41.873 --> 09:44.239
Already enemies of Rome
easily recruited to our cause.

09:47.170 --> 09:49.707
A reasonable course.
Well thought.

09:49.881 --> 09:51.917
I shall break words
with Crixus.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.377
Towards what end?

09:54.803 --> 09:56.134
He stands for the Gauls.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.795
- Then he is waist-deep in shit.
- They are half our number

09:58.973 --> 10:01.635
and much needed
in any attempt on Neapolis.

10:01.810 --> 10:03.141
The man himself

10:03.311 --> 10:05.518
is in need of distraction
from wounded soul.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.295
How did you survive...

10:42.058 --> 10:46.472
after your woman
was taken from you forever?

10:46.646 --> 10:48.511
The man that l was did not.

10:52.110 --> 10:56.649
lam but bones and flesh,

10:56.823 --> 10:58.529
void of beating heart.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.157
We will see empty chest filled

11:01.327 --> 11:03.192
with the blood of Romans.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.032
An ocean of it

11:05.206 --> 11:07.492
would not wash away
what I have done.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.703
What you have done?

11:09.878 --> 11:11.834
l pursued Naevia's affections,

11:12.005 --> 11:15.042
regardless of concern
toward discovery,

11:15.216 --> 11:17.707
of what Lucretia would do if...

11:19.429 --> 11:21.385
betrayal were known.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.471
Naevia is gone
from this world...

11:28.938 --> 11:31.600
because of
my selfish desires.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.106
We do not choose love.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.234
It claims each man as it will.

11:39.616 --> 11:43.575
And it grips
until there is nothing left.

11:45.663 --> 11:49.281
An empty hand
can yet become a fist.

11:50.335 --> 11:53.168
How many more remain
shackled in servitude

11:53.338 --> 11:54.703
as Naevia was?

11:54.881 --> 11:57.167
Without hope of love
orgenﬂetouch?

11:57.342 --> 11:59.583
Together we can strike chain
from neck--

11:59.761 --> 12:03.253
On this subject,
l have heard your thoughts.

12:06.809 --> 12:09.095
Leave me to my own.

12:11.606 --> 12:13.312
She was a radiant spirit.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.892
Yet she died a slave.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.069
A fate shared by my wife.

12:22.033 --> 12:24.319
I would not see
more like them fall

12:24.494 --> 12:28.988
because men who could
make difference stood idle.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.965
A sword in his chest
would be a blow less felt.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.011
We have all made sacrifices.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.601
- Crixus now makes his.
- I would speak with him.

12:56.734 --> 13:00.272
Your words would only cause
greater suffering.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.698
If he knew the truth...

13:02.865 --> 13:04.730
I would not have you
and countless others

13:04.909 --> 13:06.410
fall in vain attempt.

13:07.662 --> 13:08.993
Come.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.540
There is much planning
yet needed towards Neapolis.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.050
Ah, that vacant gaze.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.678
l've witnessed it before,

13:31.853 --> 13:34.265
when you were upon your knees
in the Pits, awaiting death.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.731
Or were you longing for it?

13:38.901 --> 13:40.641
Is that why you sought out

13:40.820 --> 13:43.436
a place void of precious honor?

13:43.614 --> 13:46.401
A thought drags
the mighty Oenomaus

13:46.576 --> 13:48.567
into the depth
of the underworld?

13:48.745 --> 13:51.031
Your betrayal of the house
that saved you

13:51.205 --> 13:53.036
from such torment there?

13:53.207 --> 13:55.914
A brotherhood turning
your instruction as Doctore

13:56.085 --> 13:57.416
to treachery or murder?

13:57.587 --> 14:00.545
Or that Ashur
escaped your attempt

14:00.715 --> 14:02.922
to rob him of life?

14:08.389 --> 14:10.675
A thing of low importance.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.216
Let us set past behind us...

14:14.395 --> 14:19.059
...and turn eye towards
less quarrelsome future.

14:21.194 --> 14:24.027
Ah. No, no.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.937
You must ask for it.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.816
You must break silence
and speak.

14:31.913 --> 14:35.280
You thirst for water?

14:35.458 --> 14:36.948
For the release of death?

14:39.545 --> 14:41.831
Free your tongue,
and see desires quenched.

14:44.717 --> 14:45.957
( scoffs )

14:52.225 --> 14:56.093
Tell me where Spartacus
and his shits are to be found.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.556
They have spat on everything
you've held true.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.564
You owe them nothing.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.850
Speak, you fucking cunt.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.776
Very well.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.691
Remain silent.

15:11.869 --> 15:14.702
Remain living and in pain

15:14.872 --> 15:16.783
day after day

15:16.958 --> 15:19.745
with only Ashur
to comfort you...

15:21.421 --> 15:25.414
as you once comforted me
upon these very sands.

15:44.235 --> 15:46.647
You should have warned me
of their arrival.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.645
l was swept by the moment.

15:49.824 --> 15:52.110
They stood
but a short length waiting.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.401
Long enough for your father
to slip noose about my neck.

15:54.579 --> 15:57.286
All will be forgotten
when you present your men.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.573
Oh, to honor a jest of a man.

16:01.836 --> 16:02.996
Go.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.253
To honor your child...

16:08.092 --> 16:11.630
with a father that will rise
within the Senate.

16:20.021 --> 16:23.889
I did not care for Varinius' hand
upon you.

16:25.276 --> 16:27.141
Nor l.

16:34.327 --> 16:39.572
His touch will never know
wetter climes.

16:55.890 --> 16:58.427
Pressing concerns
pull mind from task.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.091
Task?

17:01.395 --> 17:03.010
You know my meaning.

17:04.065 --> 17:05.805
Must confer with Marcus

17:05.983 --> 17:09.225
towards the recall of my troops
from the south.

17:10.613 --> 17:12.103
(men grunting)

17:13.783 --> 17:15.273
We must not fall to quarrel!

17:18.412 --> 17:19.788
- You fucking--
- Get off him.

17:24.335 --> 17:26.166
Vesuvius will
serve purpose well.

17:26.337 --> 17:29.204
Agron speaks of fighting men
to be liberated from Neapolis

17:29.382 --> 17:30.588
not far from its banks.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.840
Agron can suck the piss
from my cock.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.591
Too small a drink for a man.

17:34.762 --> 17:35.922
Fuck you!

17:36.097 --> 17:38.634
- Vesuvius offers advantage.
- Fucking coward.

17:38.808 --> 17:41.174
From its shadow, we can strike
at the ports of Neapolis,

17:41.352 --> 17:43.513
ships heavy with warriors

17:43.688 --> 17:45.394
captured by the Romans,

17:45.565 --> 17:47.476
as many Of US once were.

17:47.650 --> 17:48.981
Let us hear from Crixus!

17:49.151 --> 17:50.937
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:51.112 --> 17:52.818
Crixus:
And what would he say?

17:55.116 --> 17:57.232
What words
would make difference?

17:58.661 --> 18:00.777
The ones I have told myself?

18:01.956 --> 18:04.447
Ones of hope...

18:04.625 --> 18:07.537
and promise of better days?

18:09.297 --> 18:12.505
Throat can no longer
make such empty noise.

18:12.675 --> 18:15.792
It is choked with loss.

18:17.972 --> 18:20.133
An agony familiar
to many of us.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.468
Spartacus lost his wife.

18:26.689 --> 18:28.680
Yet his fire still burns.

18:28.858 --> 18:32.976
Agron, a brother.

18:33.154 --> 18:35.861
Yet his fire still burns.

18:36.032 --> 18:38.739
We have all lost.

18:38.909 --> 18:42.493
We have all seen
those held as friend...

18:44.540 --> 18:46.656
as family...

18:48.336 --> 18:50.201
as lover...

18:51.505 --> 18:54.087
fall to the Romans.

18:55.259 --> 18:57.500
Yet our fire still burns.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.138
And together,

19:03.309 --> 19:06.847
we shall ignite an inferno.

19:10.775 --> 19:15.109
I move to Vesuvius
with Spartacus.

19:17.198 --> 19:19.063
( cheering )

19:30.961 --> 19:33.338
- ( grunting)
- ( yelling)

19:37.051 --> 19:39.884
( groans softly )

19:42.431 --> 19:43.932
( growls )

19:47.687 --> 19:49.678
( panting )

19:51.273 --> 19:54.106
You will speak.

19:54.276 --> 19:55.891
In your final moments,

19:56.070 --> 19:59.403
when you beg for life's end,

19:59.573 --> 20:02.485
you will tell me
where Spartacus and--

20:08.082 --> 20:10.494
You fucking cunt.

20:11.752 --> 20:14.915
I shall tear the words
from your fucking mouth.

20:19.427 --> 20:20.462
Lucretia: Ashur!

20:36.402 --> 20:39.894
Oenomaus must not die
before prophecy is fulfilled.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.733
Then entreat the fucking heavens
to pry his lips.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.067
Oh, you would do well

20:43.242 --> 20:45.028
to seal your own,
lest tongue escape you.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.579
I should never have returned
to this house.

20:49.206 --> 20:51.367
Fortunes darken
as consequence.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.999
Look to the gods
for illumination.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.130
The gods?

20:59.717 --> 21:02.424
Was it Jupiter
that found you near death?

21:07.057 --> 21:10.470
Or Venus who stitched
your mangled womb?

21:11.729 --> 21:13.344
(screaming )

21:17.485 --> 21:20.522
Did Mars see you
fed and clothed?

21:20.696 --> 21:22.732
Did Apollo deliver Oenomaus
into your hands?

21:22.907 --> 21:24.488
No!

21:24.658 --> 21:27.570
It was Ashur,
lowest of fucking mortals.

21:27.745 --> 21:30.361
You but service
the will of the gods.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.996
- l was serving you.
- And | them.

21:38.047 --> 21:40.914
( laughs)

21:42.301 --> 21:47.091
Then I fear
that we are both forsaken.

21:49.266 --> 21:52.008
The man will not speak.

21:52.186 --> 21:53.676
Absent his words,

21:53.854 --> 21:56.391
your prophecy
will fall to ruin,

21:56.565 --> 21:58.351
the pious
quickly to follow.

22:00.861 --> 22:03.443
Even the dead
may give voice to passion.

22:03.614 --> 22:06.902
The man stands empty
of such worldly vice.

22:08.202 --> 22:10.363
Then see him filled

22:10.538 --> 22:12.779
with memories of the past.

22:15.543 --> 22:18.376
There is a secret buried
within these walls.

22:20.256 --> 22:23.373
And you will see it exhumed

22:23.551 --> 22:25.792
and the corpse set to purpose.

22:34.728 --> 22:35.717
( dice rattle )

22:35.896 --> 22:38.478
Double or nothing.

22:45.990 --> 22:48.231
The hour grows late,

22:48.409 --> 22:49.990
and our bed cold.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.409
Fall to it.

22:52.580 --> 22:54.616
I'll be with you presently.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.082
A maddening thing,

22:59.253 --> 23:01.585
to forever be waiting for you,

23:01.755 --> 23:03.256
far from your side.

23:03.424 --> 23:06.257
It's not always
the safest place,

23:06.427 --> 23:08.338
as many have learned.

23:11.599 --> 23:13.135
I am not the past.

23:14.852 --> 23:17.434
I stand with you now

23:17.605 --> 23:19.971
and would hold more value
than gentle touch

23:20.149 --> 23:21.855
and satisfying your needs.

23:23.611 --> 23:25.317
I would stand beside you,

23:25.487 --> 23:28.479
blade gripped
in hand slick with Roman blood.

23:30.451 --> 23:32.658
I will not be helpless
as Naevia was...

23:33.954 --> 23:37.412
her life slow march
towards death.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.625
We all move toward such end.

23:41.795 --> 23:44.047
Only the length
of the journey differs.

23:44.214 --> 23:46.796
Then let us greet it together...

23:48.552 --> 23:51.464
and show not all go quietly.

24:25.923 --> 24:27.254
No, no. I've got it.

24:27.424 --> 24:28.504
- You got it?
- Yes.

24:28.676 --> 24:30.917
( laughs )
You intend to spirit away

24:31.095 --> 24:33.427
the entire villa in that trunk?

24:33.597 --> 24:36.339
We do not know
what Vesuvius holds, Chadara.

24:36.517 --> 24:37.927
Agron would have us
well supplied.

24:38.102 --> 24:39.433
Agron, yes.

24:39.603 --> 24:41.559
He is of a form, is he not?

24:41.730 --> 24:43.061
lsuppose.

24:43.232 --> 24:44.642
Oh, you suppose?

24:44.817 --> 24:47.058
Do not think l have not noticed
your eyes upon him,

24:47.236 --> 24:48.567
nor the way of late

24:48.737 --> 24:50.773
you have been huddled together
in intimate conversation.

24:50.948 --> 24:53.655
You mistake
subject of discussion.

24:53.826 --> 24:56.112
Yet not the blush
upon your cheek when he is near.

24:57.162 --> 24:58.151
( laughs)

24:59.873 --> 25:02.455
You would do yourself well
to pursue desire.

25:02.626 --> 25:04.662
I would myself,
ifl believed he favored me.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.702
I thought you were
taken with Rhaskos.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.871
Rhaskos is a base animal,

25:09.049 --> 25:10.505
yet one with sharp claws,

25:10.676 --> 25:12.416
offering protection
and position.

25:13.929 --> 25:16.045
Spartacus holds Agron
in much high esteem.

25:17.558 --> 25:19.765
I envy you his attentions.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.974
( overlapping chatter)

25:28.152 --> 25:29.232
We can reach Vesuvius
by nightfall

25:29.403 --> 25:30.859
if we put
the slaver wagon to use.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.270
It would commit us to the roads.

25:32.448 --> 25:33.563
The forest
would hide our numbers.

25:33.741 --> 25:34.730
And slow progress.

25:34.908 --> 25:37.160
A fair trade, to see us all
to the mountain alive.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.079
Crixus.

25:46.253 --> 25:48.369
l was not in favor
of your training.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.128
Do you know the reason?

25:50.299 --> 25:52.585
I made attempt on Spartacus.

25:52.760 --> 25:56.218
As have I,
on more than one occasion.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.764
I did not trust you,

25:57.931 --> 25:59.887
because you are Syrian.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.424
l have had
unfortunate acquaintance

26:01.602 --> 26:04.184
with one of your people,

26:04.354 --> 26:06.970
as did my woman--
Naevia.

26:08.108 --> 26:09.097
Apologies.

26:09.276 --> 26:11.517
He caused her much pain.

26:11.695 --> 26:13.026
Yet despite this,

26:13.197 --> 26:14.903
she would not have held you
for his actions.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.531
Such was her heart,

26:17.701 --> 26:19.157
one I shall try to honor

26:19.328 --> 26:21.740
in thought and deed.

26:31.465 --> 26:33.296
There is something
I must tell you.

26:33.467 --> 26:36.083
Rome considers us nagging fly.

26:36.261 --> 26:38.172
After Neapolis,
they shall know the sting--

26:38.347 --> 26:39.757
Agron!

26:46.688 --> 26:49.020
Take your man!

26:49.191 --> 26:50.727
- Fucking shit!
- |'|| fucking kill you!

26:50.901 --> 26:53.108
Have you lost mind?

26:53.278 --> 26:54.484
Regained heart.

26:54.655 --> 26:55.895
Naevia lives.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.031
How do you come by this?

27:00.202 --> 27:01.533
The boy Nasir.

27:01.703 --> 27:04.194
The slaver told
not of her death,

27:04.373 --> 27:05.704
but of her suffering
in the mines.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.614
An equal fate.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.329
Why would you bear false tongue

27:09.503 --> 27:10.834
when a life
holds in the balance?

27:11.004 --> 27:12.540
What of our lives?

27:14.675 --> 27:17.166
What of our lives?!

27:18.720 --> 27:22.554
Crixus has no thought
towards any but Naevia

27:22.724 --> 27:25.682
and would have us all
meet our end

27:25.853 --> 27:27.639
in foolish attempt on the mines.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.605
I did what needed to be done,
Spartacus.

27:31.775 --> 27:34.312
You must see this.

27:39.783 --> 27:43.367
A lie for the greater good.

27:47.708 --> 27:49.994
One that would never
have passed lips,

27:50.169 --> 27:52.626
had it been your brother Duro
in her place.

27:58.385 --> 28:02.003
If a single life
holds no value...

28:03.307 --> 28:04.797
then none are of worth!

28:15.485 --> 28:17.817
I stand with Crixus

28:17.988 --> 28:20.195
and will see Naevia
from bondage.

28:23.118 --> 28:24.904
I will not fucking die for this.

28:26.663 --> 28:28.699
I move for Vesuvius.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.994
Those that would live...

28:35.839 --> 28:37.340
join me.

28:47.851 --> 28:49.466
Fuck.

28:59.112 --> 29:01.603
( overlapping chattering )

29:08.997 --> 29:10.612
( chuckles )

29:10.791 --> 29:12.952
He returns to us.

29:14.002 --> 29:16.038
l have sat vigil

29:16.213 --> 29:17.419
throughout chill embrace
of night,

29:17.589 --> 29:20.001
concerned that in eruption,
I had...

29:21.301 --> 29:22.962
released you to the afterlife.

29:23.136 --> 29:24.467
Gates, hup.

29:24.638 --> 29:27.129
It swells heart to find you
yet bound to this world.

29:28.392 --> 29:30.599
Still not a word?

29:31.770 --> 29:34.352
Very well. Save voice.

29:35.732 --> 29:38.439
I would enjoy the sweet caress
of my own.

29:39.903 --> 29:41.985
So very much to speak of,

29:42.155 --> 29:44.441
long years of secrets
within this house,

29:44.616 --> 29:47.699
seeping in the very bones
that support it.

29:47.869 --> 29:50.281
Place ear to any beam,

29:50.455 --> 29:53.788
and marvel at the whispers
of the past.

29:56.503 --> 29:58.289
It was there
that | first discovered Crixus

29:58.463 --> 30:01.296
embrace an ill-fated love
with the young Naevia.

30:05.595 --> 30:09.087
There, dominus blessed me
with elevation

30:09.266 --> 30:11.222
upon heel of ending
Magistrate Calavius

30:11.393 --> 30:13.475
and cursing Solonius
with the deed.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.476
Further inside,

30:15.647 --> 30:17.638
where Gannicus
first took your wife

30:17.816 --> 30:20.558
as entertainment
for noble Varis.

30:27.034 --> 30:28.240
Lie.

30:28.410 --> 30:30.776
(sighs)

30:30.954 --> 30:33.696
Stone at last cracks

30:33.874 --> 30:35.705
in defense of a fucking whore.

30:38.628 --> 30:41.210
Were you really so blind?

30:41.381 --> 30:43.337
The lingering gazes
they shared?

30:43.508 --> 30:46.500
The subtle change
in your brother?

30:49.723 --> 30:53.215
You know nothing
of brotherhood.

30:53.393 --> 30:55.884
Nor did Gannicus.

30:56.063 --> 30:58.224
Have you never asked yourself
how your wife

30:58.398 --> 31:00.684
came to sip a tainted wine

31:00.859 --> 31:02.724
that was meant
for Batiatus? Hmm?

31:02.903 --> 31:04.939
And she was not in the habit
of thieving, was she,

31:05.113 --> 31:08.901
or partaking of drink alone.

31:12.704 --> 31:13.739
Do you recall that night?

31:14.998 --> 31:16.534
Gannicus to be sold
the next morning.

31:16.708 --> 31:20.326
You conveniently
removed to town.

31:21.546 --> 31:25.664
Your wife slipping away
into Gannicus' cell.

31:30.263 --> 31:33.471
One last fuck.

31:36.103 --> 31:37.593
(coughs)

31:38.772 --> 31:40.512
You're all the same.

31:40.690 --> 31:42.396
Spartacus, Crixus,

31:42.567 --> 31:46.059
the noble Oenomaus.

31:46.238 --> 31:49.776
Fallen to ruin for a woman
plowed by other men's cock.

31:52.285 --> 31:55.118
Search heart
and feel the sting of truth.

31:57.290 --> 32:00.202
It was a gift for Titus.

32:00.377 --> 32:02.117
How did it come
to pass her lips?

32:02.295 --> 32:03.580
She was no thief.

32:05.257 --> 32:07.919
Your wife betrayed you,

32:08.093 --> 32:10.254
your brother--

32:10.429 --> 32:12.715
everyone you believed
to love you.

32:14.099 --> 32:16.681
What does a serpent
know of love?

32:16.852 --> 32:18.183
Oh.

32:18.353 --> 32:20.139
That its bite is often fatal.

32:21.398 --> 32:23.684
Your wife fell to its venom,

32:23.859 --> 32:26.601
as did the traitor
Spartacus' bitch.

32:26.778 --> 32:29.611
Even the mighty Gaul
saw his heart withered

32:29.781 --> 32:33.615
when ripe Naevia was plucked
forever from his grasp.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.616
They will find her

32:35.787 --> 32:38.199
and, one day...

32:39.332 --> 32:41.323
your fucking throat.

32:41.501 --> 32:44.834
Find her?

32:49.342 --> 32:51.924
That is why they
have moved south.

32:52.095 --> 32:54.507
( laughs)

32:57.225 --> 33:00.308
Spartacus is not the one
that spurs their intent.

33:01.855 --> 33:02.844
Crixus?

33:03.023 --> 33:05.309
The Gaul who lost mind
before you and Batiatus

33:05.484 --> 33:08.226
and attacked me,
his purpose then as now,

33:08.403 --> 33:12.021
love for domina's
body slave Naevia.

33:12.199 --> 33:15.362
You pledged to discover
Spartacus' location.

33:15.535 --> 33:17.196
Instead you return

33:17.370 --> 33:20.203
with tales of fluttering hearts.

33:20.373 --> 33:22.989
She was taken from this house.
I know Crixus.

33:23.168 --> 33:24.704
He will not rest until--

33:24.878 --> 33:26.493
See him to proper reward!

33:26.671 --> 33:28.286
Wait! Wait! Wait!

33:30.008 --> 33:32.249
You would turn from the gods

33:32.427 --> 33:33.928
and their guidance?

33:36.723 --> 33:40.307
Even if this crude vessel
disgorged truth,

33:40.477 --> 33:42.342
such knowledge
provides little more

33:42.521 --> 33:44.637
than feather upon breeze.

33:44.814 --> 33:47.647
Yet I know of calming winds

33:47.817 --> 33:51.651
and where a dark little feather
came to rest at tempest's end.

34:01.248 --> 34:02.829
Do not die, you simple fuck.

34:02.999 --> 34:05.160
Will you mourn me if I do?

34:05.335 --> 34:07.496
Until I find better to fill me.

34:07.671 --> 34:10.629
- Bitch.
-( laughs)

34:14.010 --> 34:16.752
Are we to attack naked,

34:16.930 --> 34:19.842
with our cocks as weapons?

34:20.016 --> 34:22.052
You would fare just as well.

34:22.227 --> 34:25.060
Remove yourself
from fucking sight.

34:25.230 --> 34:26.219
Go.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.354
Seek us out at Vesuvius

34:28.525 --> 34:29.810
if you live.

34:29.985 --> 34:31.646
Pray I do not.

34:33.321 --> 34:35.482
l accompanied my dominus
to the mines once.

34:35.657 --> 34:37.272
I may be of some aid.

34:38.410 --> 34:39.650
Well received.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.030
Fucking Syrians.

34:47.544 --> 34:49.034
The wagon is readied.

34:53.466 --> 34:54.967
Spartacus.

34:58.722 --> 35:00.383
Save words for Naevia,

35:00.557 --> 35:02.263
when we have returned her
to your arms.

35:03.351 --> 35:04.761
I would have it so

35:04.936 --> 35:06.437
or perish in the attempt.

35:23.705 --> 35:26.071
Move along, you fucking dogs!

35:55.111 --> 35:57.523
Do not expose brand.

35:57.697 --> 36:00.154
We will lose advantage of
being thought as common slaves.

36:00.325 --> 36:03.362
A crack to Liscus' skull
will add to the deception.

36:03.536 --> 36:04.525
( laughs)

36:06.456 --> 36:08.913
That's the wagon for Ferox.

36:09.084 --> 36:11.370
Lower voice.

36:15.340 --> 36:17.672
Keep moving, cunt.

36:17.842 --> 36:19.673
Do I give coin to sit upon ass?

36:19.844 --> 36:21.630
See them from the fucking wagon!

36:22.972 --> 36:24.098
Out.

36:27.644 --> 36:28.633
Hurry up.

36:28.812 --> 36:31.144
Is this the stock from Ferox?

36:32.232 --> 36:33.563
Two days past expected delivery.

36:33.733 --> 36:35.189
- Two fucking days!
- Apologies. |--

36:35.360 --> 36:37.851
I do not know you.
Where is Ferox?

36:38.029 --> 36:40.315
Dead.

36:40.490 --> 36:42.572
We were set upon by Spartacus
and his shits,

36:42.742 --> 36:45.529
the reason for our delay
and Ferox's permanent absence.

36:52.585 --> 36:55.167
( laughs)

36:55.338 --> 36:58.626
l have wished the man
to grass for many years.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.882
Yet he fucks me
from the afterlife.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.168
Schedule now teeters upon brink,

37:03.346 --> 37:06.179
with little hope
of regaining balance.

37:06.349 --> 37:08.010
Yes, again, apologies. |--

37:08.184 --> 37:09.970
Am I to present myself now?

37:11.312 --> 37:14.804
Yes. Yes!

37:14.983 --> 37:17.190
A special offering,
to compensate your troubles.

37:17.360 --> 37:18.691
Wait here.

37:18.862 --> 37:21.569
Rotten cunt serves no trade.

37:38.882 --> 37:41.715
( laughs)

37:41.885 --> 37:45.298
What misdeed sees such beauty
condemned to the mines?

37:45.472 --> 37:48.259
Form words, or find my cock
reason you cannot.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.424
I fell in love.

37:50.602 --> 37:53.344
( chuckles )
Well, no danger of that here.

37:55.648 --> 37:56.979
( gasps )

37:57.150 --> 37:59.436
I would have you
form words now,

37:59.611 --> 38:01.192
or find your cock
upon the floor.

38:01.362 --> 38:04.354
There was a woman brought here
from the House of Batiatus,

38:04.532 --> 38:05.942
beautiful and young,

38:06.117 --> 38:09.154
one a fat shit like you
would have taken notice of.

38:09.329 --> 38:10.739
Speak.

38:10.914 --> 38:12.905
I know of no such woman.

38:13.082 --> 38:15.243
Search fucking memory.

38:15.418 --> 38:16.919
She is dark of skin

38:17.086 --> 38:19.543
with the mark of Batiatus' wife
upon the back of her shoulder.

38:19.714 --> 38:22.956
I do recall one
as you just described.

38:24.260 --> 38:25.249
Does she yet draw breath?

38:25.428 --> 38:26.463
I believe it so.

38:26.638 --> 38:28.924
- ( groans )
- Where is she?

38:29.098 --> 38:30.429
Assigned to dig
the eastern vein.

38:30.600 --> 38:33.262
( groans )
There is a map.

38:34.562 --> 38:36.348
Show me.

38:36.523 --> 38:37.683
Slowly.

38:37.857 --> 38:39.848
Mira has been gone too long.

38:42.111 --> 38:43.612
You there.

38:48.159 --> 38:50.024
From where do you hail?

38:50.203 --> 38:51.659
Sicilia.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.616
( panting )
In the tunnel

38:53.790 --> 38:57.248
where it branches off, here--

39:00.672 --> 39:02.162
l have seen you before...

39:02.340 --> 39:03.750
somewhere.

39:05.927 --> 39:07.167
The arena.

39:30.660 --> 39:32.616
Keys quickly. Come.

39:36.082 --> 39:37.117
Mira.

39:38.918 --> 39:40.249
It is Roman blood.

39:40.420 --> 39:42.331
Did he know of her?

39:42.505 --> 39:43.494
Does Naevia live?

39:43.673 --> 39:44.708
She does.

39:45.758 --> 39:48.090
Mannus, Plenus,
assume their mantle.

39:48.261 --> 39:50.126
Make it known if any
become aware of our presence.

39:50.305 --> 39:52.045
Into the mines. Quickly.

39:56.728 --> 39:58.093
Come, brother.

39:58.271 --> 39:59.681
Let us see heart restored.

39:59.856 --> 40:01.221
Go.

40:02.233 --> 40:03.564
Move. Go!

40:11.618 --> 40:13.825
Mmm, you really must try this.

40:13.995 --> 40:15.656
It is divine.

40:15.830 --> 40:18.412
I fear stomach turned
at the moment.

40:18.583 --> 40:19.914
I do not envy you.

40:20.084 --> 40:22.871
Sickness with every sunrise.
Swelling beyond reason.

40:23.963 --> 40:25.828
Though the breasts
are a benefit, I suppose.

40:26.007 --> 40:27.122
( chuckles )

40:27.300 --> 40:30.417
To feel a child
grow within you.

40:30.595 --> 40:32.131
There is no greater blessing.

40:32.305 --> 40:34.546
What of being thought of
other than matron?

40:34.724 --> 40:38.182
Enticing men until they
fawn over your every word,

40:38.353 --> 40:40.935
aching to receive
the slightest touch? ( laughs)

40:41.105 --> 40:44.393
The bonds of marriage
desired result.

40:45.818 --> 40:48.981
lsuppose
it would not be too horrid

40:49.155 --> 40:51.441
if he were handsome and rich

40:51.616 --> 40:53.277
and thought of nothing
but his hands upon me.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.783
( laughs)

40:59.666 --> 41:01.827
Lust, as all things,

41:02.001 --> 41:04.287
fades with the passing of years.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.578
( horns sound )

41:06.756 --> 41:08.997
( cheering )

41:09.175 --> 41:10.506
Sun draws high.

41:10.677 --> 41:12.713
Let us fall to our seats
and see day begin.

41:15.264 --> 41:18.097
Varinius tells that your men
are to be presented.

41:18.267 --> 41:21.009
Yes. The request
would have fallen to yours

41:21.187 --> 41:22.927
if they were proper soldiers.

41:23.106 --> 41:24.346
( chuckles )

41:24.524 --> 41:27.982
I look forward to witnessing
proper Roman formation.

41:28.152 --> 41:30.359
It should be a pleasant
distraction for the people

41:30.530 --> 41:33.567
while my men
bring Spartacus to justice.

41:34.659 --> 41:35.865
Yes.

41:43.167 --> 41:44.873
Are your soldiers to purpose?

41:45.044 --> 41:46.625
They are.

41:46.796 --> 41:48.661
The crowd is yours, Varinius.

41:53.094 --> 41:55.585
Good citizens of Capua!

41:57.348 --> 42:00.385
I present these games to honor
the beloved sister of Rome!

42:01.436 --> 42:04.394
And to send message
that her spirit

42:04.564 --> 42:07.601
shall never be quelled by those
who seek to cause her injury.

42:07.775 --> 42:09.311
( cheering )

42:09.485 --> 42:10.816
Your cheers in the coming days

42:10.987 --> 42:13.444
shall serve as balm
to wounded heart,

42:13.614 --> 42:16.822
a wound shared by many
in this great city

42:16.993 --> 42:19.200
so inflicted by the treachery

42:19.370 --> 42:21.452
of Spartacus
and his murderous horde.

42:21.622 --> 42:23.783
-( booing )
- Yeah!

42:24.917 --> 42:27.954
lcall now upon the sons
of Rome to march,

42:28.129 --> 42:30.290
the thunder of their every step
a declaration

42:30.465 --> 42:32.956
that loss and grief

42:33.134 --> 42:35.546
shall give way
to triumph and joy!

42:35.720 --> 42:37.802
( cheering )

42:41.350 --> 42:43.762
Spectator:
What's happening?

42:43.936 --> 42:45.517
Come on.
No one's coming!

42:45.688 --> 42:47.895
- ( booing )
- Where are they?

42:48.066 --> 42:49.431
What the fuck
is going on?

42:54.989 --> 42:56.820
Where are your fucking men?

42:56.991 --> 42:59.949
Set to purpose,
as promised.

43:05.333 --> 43:06.948
Hey, forward!

43:08.002 --> 43:10.118
Find the fucking passage.

43:13.633 --> 43:15.043
Seal the road.

43:16.803 --> 43:18.509
You!

43:19.847 --> 43:23.339
We come on order of
Praetor Gaius Claudius Glaber.

43:23.518 --> 43:25.179
Has attempt been made
to breach the mines?

43:25.353 --> 43:27.594
None. It stands secure.

43:29.816 --> 43:31.681
Dispatch word to Capua.

43:31.859 --> 43:33.315
I would turn from fool's errand

43:33.486 --> 43:35.192
and recommit
to sweep the countryside.

43:46.999 --> 43:48.830
Seize him!

43:51.129 --> 43:52.710
I know these men.

43:52.880 --> 43:54.211
Mannus and Plenus,

43:54.382 --> 43:56.043
gladiators bearing
the mark of Batiatus.

44:04.392 --> 44:06.223
Spartacus is here.

44:06.394 --> 44:09.261
(men grunting)

44:10.356 --> 44:11.345
Which way do we go?

44:11.524 --> 44:12.764
They both
should lead us to it.

44:12.942 --> 44:15.228
This one the shorter path.

44:15.403 --> 44:16.483
I would double odds
toward goal.

44:16.654 --> 44:18.235
Take the longer path.

44:18.406 --> 44:20.067
Move quietly.

44:24.162 --> 44:25.493
( booing )

44:25.663 --> 44:28.029
People of Capua!

44:28.207 --> 44:31.324
Noble Varinius!

44:31.502 --> 44:33.333
I offer apologies!

44:33.504 --> 44:36.712
I do not seek to lower spirits

44:36.883 --> 44:40.046
with absence of display,

44:40.219 --> 44:43.211
but instead to raise them up

44:43.389 --> 44:45.801
with knowledge that my soldiers

44:45.975 --> 44:49.058
have been set to higher purpose

44:49.228 --> 44:50.889
by the gods themselves!

44:51.063 --> 44:52.769
( cheering )

44:52.940 --> 44:55.397
At this very moment,

44:55.568 --> 44:58.401
they close on Spartacus!

45:03.242 --> 45:05.233
And by day's end,

45:05.411 --> 45:08.744
he shall once more kneel

45:08.915 --> 45:12.624
before the glory of Rome!

45:12.793 --> 45:15.455
- ( cheering )
- Rome!

45:15.630 --> 45:17.962
( chanting )
Rome! Rome! Rome!

45:18.132 --> 45:21.249
Rome! Rome! Rome!

45:21.427 --> 45:23.292
Rome! Rome!

45:23.471 --> 45:25.883
Rome! Rome! Rome!

45:30.519 --> 45:32.510
(water splashing )

45:39.904 --> 45:41.519
We must see them freed.

45:41.697 --> 45:43.904
There are too many of them.

45:44.075 --> 45:45.235
We would be discovered.

45:49.622 --> 45:51.158
Live,

45:51.332 --> 45:53.493
and know I will return.

45:54.502 --> 45:56.163
Crixus: Naevia!

45:58.923 --> 46:00.333
Naevia.

46:01.676 --> 46:03.166
Naevia?

46:07.556 --> 46:09.296
Naevia?

46:10.518 --> 46:11.849
Naevia!

46:16.190 --> 46:17.646
This is where
he said she would be?

46:17.817 --> 46:19.182
If he spoke truth.

46:26.325 --> 46:27.656
Crixus!

46:27.827 --> 46:30.534
There is one here with mark
of her domina upon back!

46:32.540 --> 46:34.872
Naevia. Naevia?

46:40.548 --> 46:42.254
(woman sobbing )

46:42.425 --> 46:43.915
No.

46:45.720 --> 46:48.052
You are safe.

46:48.222 --> 46:50.133
You are safe now.

46:50.308 --> 46:51.798
I'm here.

46:56.022 --> 46:57.512
I'm here.

47:02.028 --> 47:03.939
Crixus?

47:08.743 --> 47:09.983
Crixus:
Forgive me.

47:11.829 --> 47:13.615
Forgive me
for what I have done.

47:14.874 --> 47:17.661
Spartacus,
someone comes.

47:21.881 --> 47:23.246
Go! Go!

47:23.424 --> 47:25.085
Roman:
They're down here!

47:42.234 --> 47:43.485
Ashur.

47:44.653 --> 47:45.904
Ashur!

47:46.072 --> 47:48.609
Move! Move! Go!

47:54.288 --> 47:55.323
( cheering )

48:15.309 --> 48:16.970
Come on!

48:17.144 --> 48:19.180
( metal clanging )

48:19.355 --> 48:20.845
( gladiator yells )

48:25.194 --> 48:26.479
Here!

48:30.408 --> 48:32.319
(yelling)

48:41.669 --> 48:43.000
-(gaspS)
- ( cheering )

48:48.050 --> 48:49.335
Wait!

48:49.510 --> 48:50.841
There's a runoff.

48:51.011 --> 48:53.047
It empties out
on the other side of the mine.

48:53.222 --> 48:54.553
Which path do we take?

48:54.723 --> 48:56.714
- Quickly!
- This way.

49:01.272 --> 49:03.012
She leads us
to our fucking death.

49:05.192 --> 49:08.275
Take breath,
and gain your bearing.

49:10.364 --> 49:13.106
A turn missed.
It will take us to the water.

49:14.952 --> 49:16.692
Here.

49:24.462 --> 49:27.249
Move! Stay together.

49:29.592 --> 49:30.707
Wait!

49:35.264 --> 49:36.253
Come on! Go!

49:36.432 --> 49:38.639
- Weapon.
- Come on.

49:41.103 --> 49:43.810
Roman: Back there, by the gate.

49:44.815 --> 49:46.976
I will give them pause...

49:48.319 --> 49:50.435
so you may slip from grasp.

49:50.613 --> 49:52.103
- Roman: You two, down there.
- Right.

49:53.699 --> 49:55.610
See Naevia to safety.

49:56.660 --> 49:57.911
Crixus!

49:59.079 --> 50:00.410
See it done, brother.

50:00.581 --> 50:02.321
- ( shrieks)
- Go! Go!

50:02.500 --> 50:03.831
Spartacus!

50:06.253 --> 50:07.413
Go!

50:13.928 --> 50:14.963
( shrieks )

50:19.141 --> 50:20.426
- Yeah!
- Ooh!

50:31.028 --> 50:32.063
Fuck you!

50:32.238 --> 50:34.274
Fuck you, bastard!
You Roman dog!

51:02.726 --> 51:03.761
(chanting)
Kill! Kill!

51:03.936 --> 51:05.801
( stadium crowd chanting )

51:07.231 --> 51:08.971
No!

51:15.990 --> 51:18.072
Naevia: Crixus!

51:18.242 --> 51:19.231
Crixus!

51:24.498 --> 51:26.784
Crixus! Crixus.

51:26.959 --> 51:28.369
Naevia: Crixus!

51:28.544 --> 51:30.409
(sobbing )

51:37.011 --> 51:39.002
(theme music playing )
