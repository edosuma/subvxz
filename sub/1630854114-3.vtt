00:02.536 --> 00:03.837
Previously on
Bob Hearts Abishola...

00:03.937 --> 00:07.641
How would you feel about
sitting in that chair?

00:08.409 --> 00:09.877
That is your chair.
No.

00:09.977 --> 00:13.081
That chair belongs
to the president of the company.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.582
I'm gonna be CEO.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.517
What is the difference?

00:16.617 --> 00:18.252
Well, the president
does all the work

00:18.352 --> 00:20.088
and the CEO drops by
every now and then

00:20.188 --> 00:22.290
to criticize that work.

00:23.057 --> 00:25.393
So, you would be like my mother?

00:26.227 --> 00:27.595
Don't make it weird.

00:34.968 --> 00:37.338
(humming a tune)

00:37.438 --> 00:39.340
Good morning, my sweet.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.508
Why didn't you wake me up?

00:40.608 --> 00:41.775
That's on you.
You shouldn't

00:41.875 --> 00:43.311
look like an angel
when you sleep.

00:43.411 --> 00:46.414
Dele is not ready,
I'm going to miss my bus,

00:46.514 --> 00:48.316
I have not even packed my lunch.
Ah, ah, ah.

00:48.416 --> 00:50.684
Lunch is made,
Dele is getting dressed,

00:50.784 --> 00:52.453
and you can forget
about the bus,

00:52.553 --> 00:55.055
because today you have
a handsome chauffeur.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.557
Who?
Very funny.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.459
I thought so.
(chuckles)

00:58.559 --> 01:00.528
You better get used to me
treating you like a queen.

01:00.628 --> 01:01.895
Now that I'm the CEO,

01:01.995 --> 01:04.064
I can go in to work
whenever I feel like it.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.467
Today, I don't feel like it.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.569
Tomorrow's not
looking too good, either.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.504
I've never seen you so...
Carefree?

01:10.604 --> 01:13.207
Jovial? Downright giddy?
Yes.

01:13.307 --> 01:14.408
It's weird, right?

01:14.508 --> 01:16.210
It's wonderful.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.479
And by my calculations, you have

01:18.579 --> 01:20.581
30 extra minutes
to treat me like a queen.

01:20.681 --> 01:23.016
You want me to leave the apron
on or off?

01:24.017 --> 01:25.353
On.

01:26.053 --> 01:30.090
("Ifanla" by Sola Akingbola
playing)

01:52.813 --> 01:54.515
Oh, that is no problem.

01:54.615 --> 01:55.949
I'll tell the doctor.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.752
Okey dokey.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.288
Bye-bye.

02:01.422 --> 02:02.956
What?

02:03.056 --> 02:05.226
Okey dokey?

02:05.326 --> 02:06.527
Is that not the phrase?

02:06.627 --> 02:08.762
I just never heard
you say it before.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.831
I am in a good mood.

02:10.931 --> 02:13.367
Bob made me breakfast
this morning.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.635
Uh-huh.

02:14.735 --> 02:18.806
That is not a bacon,
egg and cheese smile.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.608
Hello, ladies.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.876
Hello.
Oh.

02:22.976 --> 02:26.380
Somebody had sex with Bob
this morning.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.015
Kemi.

02:29.283 --> 02:30.618
But I did have a good morning.

02:30.718 --> 02:31.652
How good?

02:31.752 --> 02:33.454
I had...

02:33.554 --> 02:34.722
two good mornings.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.890
All right, sock man.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.025
Yeah.

02:38.125 --> 02:39.293
Details, details.

02:39.393 --> 02:40.994
I've already told you
everything.

02:41.094 --> 02:42.896
(scoffs) Paint a picture.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.298
Were you sitting or standing?

02:44.398 --> 02:46.734
Were you in a hot tub?
A bubble bath?

02:46.834 --> 02:48.168
An Uber?

02:48.269 --> 02:50.571
I'm sorry, I'm not comfortable
talking about it.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.241
It's private.
Yeah, she's not you, Kemi.

02:53.341 --> 02:54.708
Mm-hmm.
Obviously not.

02:54.808 --> 02:57.678
Otherwise she would've had
three good mornings.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.551
(knocking)
Come in.

03:03.651 --> 03:06.854
Goodwin, the reporter
from Talk of Nigeria is here.

03:06.954 --> 03:07.888
Send him in.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.022
And, Kofo?

03:09.122 --> 03:10.824
Yes?
We're at work.

03:10.924 --> 03:14.695
I am your boss, you will
address me as Mr. Olayiwola.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.330
What about when we're at home?

03:16.430 --> 03:19.700
Let us keep it simple.
Just call me Mr. Olayiwola.

03:21.502 --> 03:25.606
Mr. Obaseki, this
is Mr. Olayiwola.

03:26.474 --> 03:28.276
Thank you, Kofo.
You are dismissed.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.946
(door closes)
Good afternoon.

03:33.046 --> 03:36.083
Mr. Olayiwola,
I'm honored to meet you.

03:36.183 --> 03:37.184
Thank you, young man.

03:37.285 --> 03:38.752
You may stand.

03:38.852 --> 03:42.756
It is a thrill to interview
a real-life business tycoon.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.725
It is a thrill to be one.

03:44.825 --> 03:47.395
Do you mind if I record
our conversation?

03:47.495 --> 03:48.262
No video?

03:48.362 --> 03:49.630
It is for the podcast.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.365
Oh.

03:51.465 --> 03:52.766
Okay.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.572
In my research,

03:58.672 --> 04:01.375
I learned that we are
from the same town in Nigeria.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.411
You are from Ilesa?
Yes, sir.

04:03.511 --> 04:05.746
Then you know
I have climbed a long way

04:05.846 --> 04:07.315
from my humble beginnings.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.216
I thought
your father was a judge.

04:09.317 --> 04:10.951
A humble judge.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.453
Only one wife.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.022
So, you did not want to follow
his footsteps into law?

04:15.122 --> 04:16.023
No.

04:16.123 --> 04:17.725
I made my own path,

04:17.825 --> 04:21.695
which led me to
the top of MaxDot Mountain.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.964
MaxDot Mountain.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.265
So eloquent.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.600
Sir,

04:26.700 --> 04:28.802
what advice do you have
for any Nigerian

04:28.902 --> 04:31.339
who hopes to reach
your level of success?

04:31.439 --> 04:34.408
They should be realistic.
Not everyone can be me.

04:34.508 --> 04:37.778
But for those chosen few:

04:37.878 --> 04:40.314
keep working, stay focused,

04:40.414 --> 04:42.550
and make a list
of those who doubted you.

04:42.650 --> 04:43.417
For vengeance?

04:43.517 --> 04:45.686
Exactly.
(knocking)

04:47.020 --> 04:49.222
Mr. Olayiwola,
Mrs. Wheeler is here to see you.

04:49.323 --> 04:50.991
He knows who I am.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.426
Who's this?

04:52.526 --> 04:54.995
He is a member of
the Nigerian press.

04:55.095 --> 04:57.297
Oh, la-di-da.

04:57.398 --> 04:58.532
This is Dorothy Wheeler.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.801
She is the "Dot" of MaxDot.

05:00.901 --> 05:03.437
It is a pleasure
to meet you, Madam.
Likewise.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.639
You know, my husband and I
started this company

05:05.739 --> 05:08.308
selling socks out of
the trunk of our Impala.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.911
Fascinating!
What year was that?

05:11.011 --> 05:14.081
It was...
1973.

05:14.181 --> 05:15.549
I was a child then,

05:15.649 --> 05:18.251
unaware of the future
that awaited me.

05:18.352 --> 05:21.221
So, if Mr. Olayiwola
is president,

05:21.321 --> 05:22.590
what is it you do?

05:22.690 --> 05:25.426
Actually, I...
If I'm doing my job well,

05:25.526 --> 05:28.128
which I am,
she does nothing.

05:28.228 --> 05:30.631
Not exactly nothing.

05:31.298 --> 05:33.233
We work ourselves to death
in this family.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.035
I've got my husband's ashes
in the office,

05:35.135 --> 05:36.169
if you want to see them.

05:36.269 --> 05:37.571
All right.
(chuckles)

05:37.671 --> 05:39.106
Thank you
for paying us

05:39.206 --> 05:40.408
a visit.

05:40.508 --> 05:41.742
So, I guess
we're done here.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.177
Come by any time.
Don't be a stranger.

05:44.277 --> 05:47.347
I did want to talk
to you about...
Okay, bye-bye.

05:49.316 --> 05:51.785
It was such an honor
to meet Mrs. Wheeler.

05:51.885 --> 05:54.287
You know the Yoruba saying,
"ori e dale"?

05:54.388 --> 05:56.557
Oh! Her head is not right?

05:56.657 --> 05:58.526
So you see what
I'm dealing with.

06:06.767 --> 06:07.835
What's his rush?

06:07.935 --> 06:11.204
Maybe he has a job
to go back to.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.507
Poor bastard.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.045
Ooh, lentil soup.

06:18.145 --> 06:20.247
I got a coupon for that.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.550
When did you become a housewife?

06:22.650 --> 06:23.817
That's a little offensive.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.286
I prefer the term
"stay-at-home Bob."

06:27.521 --> 06:29.089
Ooh, flavored croutons.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.925
Well, I am sure you have
other things planned.

06:32.025 --> 06:34.027
Maybe check in at work?

06:34.127 --> 06:35.362
No thanks.

06:35.463 --> 06:39.166
Oh. Bacon bits.

06:39.266 --> 06:41.435
Well, I must say,
you do seem happy.

06:41.535 --> 06:44.337
Are you kidding? Normally,
I'd be stuck behind my desk,

06:44.438 --> 06:45.639
screaming at a supplier,

06:45.739 --> 06:47.508
with a vein
popping out of my neck.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.677
Well, a bulging vein
is a sign of hard work.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.879
It's also a sign
of heart disease.

06:51.979 --> 06:54.247
Look at all the chips.

06:55.649 --> 06:59.119
Bob, I am worried about you.
Why?

06:59.219 --> 07:01.489
This is not who you are.

07:01.589 --> 07:03.591
Y-You are a man
who builds things,

07:03.691 --> 07:05.959
who has a vision and then
makes that vision come true.

07:06.059 --> 07:09.863
Yeah, and today I'm
envisioning lunch.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.298
And then what?

07:11.398 --> 07:12.633
Oh, I got big plans.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.535
A new business venture?
No.

07:14.635 --> 07:17.671
But I am gonna fulfill
a lifelong dream.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.841
Ugh.
Americans and their dreams.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.814
See? The stitching
on the toe seam is loose.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.916
Pull the batch and check
the rest of the shipment.

07:29.016 --> 07:31.519
Already taken care of, boss.
Well done, Douglas.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.153
You really think so?

07:33.253 --> 07:35.055
Why else would I have said it?

07:35.856 --> 07:39.092
To get me to go away.
It's what my mom does.

07:39.927 --> 07:42.796
Oh, Douglas, when did you
lose your self-respect?

07:43.831 --> 07:44.998
Fourth grade.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.167
Kofo.
Hmm?

07:47.267 --> 07:49.002
Call Mr. Andrews at
Target and tell him

07:49.102 --> 07:51.138
their order will be short.
I will make a note.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.239
No notes. Call him now.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.441
Yes, Mr. Olayiwola.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.645
It is ringing.
DOUGLAS: You know what?

07:57.745 --> 07:59.279
It was actually third grade.

07:59.379 --> 08:00.814
DOTTIE:
What's going on?

08:00.914 --> 08:02.415
Nobody told me we were
having a meeting.

08:02.516 --> 08:04.184
It was in the group chat.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.385
What the hell is a group chat?

08:05.485 --> 08:06.854
I would have knocked
on your door,

08:06.954 --> 08:09.022
but I know you like
to take a nap after lunch.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.057
Hello,

08:10.157 --> 08:11.291
this is Kofo Olanipekun,

08:11.391 --> 08:13.527
calling from MaxDot
for Mr. Andrews.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.564
I am on the hold.

08:17.464 --> 08:18.732
We got a defective shipment.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.368
I found it,
and Goodwin gave me an attaboy.

08:21.468 --> 08:22.636
Uh-huh.

08:22.736 --> 08:23.637
A real one.

08:23.737 --> 08:24.905
Right, boss?

08:25.906 --> 08:27.641
I really like this hold music.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.777
I think it might be my jam.

08:29.877 --> 08:32.079
We need to pull
the entire order.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.914
It is already taken care of.

08:34.014 --> 08:37.050
Please, feel free to go back
to your office and rest.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.052
I wasn't napping.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.120
We should get hold music

08:40.220 --> 08:41.288
like this. I am waiting,

08:41.388 --> 08:42.389
but I am having fun.

08:42.489 --> 08:44.758
Douglas,
come with me.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.227
Let's see if we have
enough stock to fill the order.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.229
I'm his right-hand man.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.431
Is there anything I can do?

08:51.531 --> 08:53.200
KOFO:
Hello, Bill.
How is it hanging,

08:53.300 --> 08:55.168
my friend?

08:55.268 --> 08:56.236
Target.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.806
(chuckles): Yes.

09:00.407 --> 09:03.376
But I'm the "Dot" in MaxDot.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.354
It's a terrible thing to say,

09:14.454 --> 09:16.489
but this is
my favorite kind of patient.

09:16.590 --> 09:17.825
Unconscious?

09:17.925 --> 09:18.926
You got it.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.360
(phone vibrates)

09:25.232 --> 09:27.067
(phone vibrates)

09:31.304 --> 09:33.006
(phone vibrates)

09:33.106 --> 09:35.275
Is that Bob again?
Yes.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.811
I know everything
he has eaten today.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.614
(phone vibrates)

09:46.654 --> 09:48.488
Maybe you should
change your number.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.457
I'm actually thinking about it.

09:51.491 --> 09:53.861
(phone vibrates)
(sighs)

09:54.762 --> 09:57.130
Ugh, now he's calling me.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.165
What?

09:58.265 --> 09:59.166
BOB:
I'm outside.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.467
Outside where?

10:00.567 --> 10:01.702
Outside the hospital, come down.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.036
I want to show you something.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.571
(sighs) Okay.

10:04.672 --> 10:07.040
And make it fast,
I'm in the ambulance lane.

10:14.147 --> 10:15.515
SECURITY GUARD:
Sir!

10:15.615 --> 10:16.784
You can't put your boat there.

10:16.884 --> 10:17.951
Hang on.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.887
Look what I got!

10:30.297 --> 10:31.665
So, what do you think?

10:31.765 --> 10:33.033
You bought a boat?

10:33.133 --> 10:35.002
I bought a boat.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.436
You need to move it!

10:36.536 --> 10:38.405
You're not a real cop.
You know that, right?

10:39.106 --> 10:41.842
Wh-Why did you buy a boat?
Because it's the only place

10:41.942 --> 10:44.244
I can wear this hat.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.979
I got you one, too.

10:46.079 --> 10:48.849
First Mate Abishola,
come aboard!

10:48.949 --> 10:50.951
No, I'm at work.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.652
You bought a boat?

10:52.753 --> 10:53.787
I bought a boat!

10:53.887 --> 10:54.855
He bought a boat.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.890
A big-ass boat.
Hey,

10:56.990 --> 10:59.092
check out the horn.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.028
(horn blares)
SECURITY GUARD: Sir!

11:01.128 --> 11:04.064
You have to move your boat!

11:12.605 --> 11:16.276
Douglas, why don't I see
a truck by the loading dock?

11:16.376 --> 11:18.746
'Cause we already packed her up
and sent her on her way.

11:18.846 --> 11:19.813
We're working on tomorrow's.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.214
Excellent.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.150
I'm proud of you
for getting ahead.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.752
(chuckles)
Dude.

11:27.687 --> 11:28.588
What are you doing?

11:28.688 --> 11:29.656
I don't know, man.

11:29.757 --> 11:31.391
This is new for me, too.

11:31.491 --> 11:34.294
Okay, let go of me now.
Sorry.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.769
Can I get everyone's attention?

11:43.070 --> 11:44.671
Because of all
of your hard work,

11:44.772 --> 11:47.841
our future
is brighter than ever.

11:47.941 --> 11:50.310
You are all living proof

11:50.410 --> 11:52.946
that the American dream
is alive and well

11:53.046 --> 11:55.715
at MaxDot Therapeutic Hosiery!

12:06.927 --> 12:08.796
I'm his right-hand man!

12:12.132 --> 12:13.934
How awesome is this, huh?

12:14.034 --> 12:15.769
Very awesome.

12:15.869 --> 12:18.839
It'll be better in the water,
but you get the idea.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.673
I do not.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.542
Hey, Tom.

12:22.642 --> 12:25.545
Check it out.
Got a boat.

12:25.645 --> 12:27.447
He's jealous.

12:27.547 --> 12:30.350
So, you are going to drive this
around the lake?

12:30.450 --> 12:32.752
Oh, you don't drive a boat,
honey, you steer it.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.755
So, you are going to steer it
around the lake?

12:35.856 --> 12:37.124
Well, eventually, yeah.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.559
I mean, I got to get
a license, take a test,

12:39.659 --> 12:41.028
learn about tides
and the moon.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.463
You know, sailor stuff.

12:43.563 --> 12:46.766
And this is all
so you can become a fisherman?

12:46.867 --> 12:48.135
What? Ugh! No.

12:48.235 --> 12:49.970
This is so we can
live on island time.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.806
But if you want to fish, that's
great, we'll get you a rod.

12:52.906 --> 12:54.274
I do not want to fish!

12:54.374 --> 12:56.109
Whoa, calm down.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.778
Let the rocking
of the boat relax you.

12:59.847 --> 13:01.548
There is no rocking.

13:01.648 --> 13:04.717
We are in the driveway.
What is happening to you?

13:04.818 --> 13:07.287
I'm sorry, I should've given you
a heads-up. But I'm still me.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.889
I'm still the guy you married.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.724
I'm just a captain now.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.461
(phone rings)

13:15.662 --> 13:16.496
Hi, Mom.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.631
Hey, Bobby. Are you busy?

13:18.731 --> 13:19.833
Little bit.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.734
Okay, I don't
want to bother you.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.370
All right.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.772
You know,
on a calm day,

13:25.873 --> 13:28.775
this baby could
get up to 50 knots.

13:28.876 --> 13:31.711
I just got to figure out
what a knot is.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.413
(phone rings)

13:34.314 --> 13:35.849
What, Mom?

13:35.949 --> 13:38.418
I just wanted to know when
you were coming back to work.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.020
Why would I want to do that?

13:40.120 --> 13:41.454
I don't know,

13:41.554 --> 13:43.823
make sure Goodwin doesn't
screw things up too much.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.292
Well, has he?

13:46.093 --> 13:47.027
No.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.395
All right,

13:48.495 --> 13:50.130
I'm gonna hang up and
enjoy my new boat.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.764
You bought a boat?

13:51.865 --> 13:54.101
I bought a boat.
Abishola, tell her.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.303
He bought a boat.

14:07.314 --> 14:09.249
(laughing)

14:11.051 --> 14:13.220
Are you laughing at my feet?

14:14.321 --> 14:16.023
You're laughing at my feet,
aren't you?

14:16.123 --> 14:17.724
I lived on a commune for a year,

14:17.824 --> 14:19.692
didn't wear shoes
the whole time.

14:20.493 --> 14:23.230
This condition
is called farm foot.

14:23.964 --> 14:26.866
(phone rings)

14:28.601 --> 14:29.402
Hi, Mom.

14:29.502 --> 14:30.770
I was wrong.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.973
I should have never
let Bob run the company.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.407
It should've been you.

14:34.507 --> 14:35.875
Are you drunk?

14:35.976 --> 14:37.077
Yes.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.146
But I mean what I say.

14:39.246 --> 14:40.413
Please come back.

14:40.513 --> 14:41.414
This is where I belong.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.383
They appreciate me here.

14:43.483 --> 14:46.086
I appreciate you, too,
sweetheart.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.588
You're smart, you're talented,

14:48.688 --> 14:51.391
and I don't want to
run this place without you.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.826
I'm sorry, I can't.

14:53.927 --> 14:55.828
But I want you to know
that it really means a lot...

14:55.929 --> 14:57.965
(blows raspberries)
I'll call Douglas.

15:00.133 --> 15:01.201
(sighs)

15:01.301 --> 15:03.103
That was my mom.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.705
The reason I have farm foot.

15:21.854 --> 15:23.623
(sighs)

15:31.598 --> 15:33.833
Oh! (laughing)

15:42.242 --> 15:46.980
(scoffs) All right,
so Nigerians do fake news, too.

15:49.016 --> 15:51.418
What, I don't deserve
lights anymore?
Oh!

15:51.518 --> 15:52.719
Mrs. Wheeler.

15:52.819 --> 15:54.921
I did not know you were here.
Yeah,

15:55.022 --> 15:56.356
nobody does.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.690
Is everything okay?

15:57.790 --> 16:00.527
For MaxDot, yeah,
everything's great.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.430
But for Dottie Wheeler...
not so much.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.198
I am sorry you feel that way.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.699
Is there anything I can do?

16:06.799 --> 16:09.836
Yeah, stop being
so damn fantastic at your job.

16:09.936 --> 16:12.705
Oh, I cannot do that,
Mrs. Wheeler.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.108
Fantastic is my sweet spot.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.577
I get it.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.579
Back when Max and I
started this company,

16:19.679 --> 16:22.815
we worked 16 hours a day,
seven days a week.

16:22.915 --> 16:24.951
I remember when
we got our first

16:25.052 --> 16:26.253
department store order,

16:26.353 --> 16:27.920
you would've thought
we won the lottery.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.322
We went out and had

16:29.422 --> 16:30.557
a big steak dinner,

16:30.657 --> 16:32.192
and then got drunk
off our asses

16:32.292 --> 16:33.626
and screwed like bunnies.

16:35.195 --> 16:38.698
Uh, many parts of that story
were nice.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.034
But that's all over.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.969
It's your turn now.
No.

16:43.070 --> 16:45.372
MaxDot will always
be a family business,

16:45.472 --> 16:47.374
and you are
the head of that family.

16:47.474 --> 16:49.076
Thank you.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.943
You're lying, but thank you.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.379
No, I'm not.

16:52.479 --> 16:55.182
I was raised
to respect my elders.

16:55.282 --> 16:56.449
In my culture,

16:56.549 --> 16:58.751
they are revered
as a source of wisdom.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.020
Yeah, well, in my culture,
they dump you in Florida

17:01.121 --> 17:03.190
the minute you forget
your middle name.

17:03.956 --> 17:05.925
I am sorry if I gave you
the wrong idea.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.194
I need you to guide me

17:07.294 --> 17:08.695
as I do my best to honor

17:08.795 --> 17:10.963
what you and your husband built.

17:11.064 --> 17:12.732
Hmm.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.934
That's something
Bob never said to me.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.136
(chuckles)

17:16.236 --> 17:17.504
Did you hear he bought a boat?

17:17.604 --> 17:19.606
Yeah, I heard. Schmuck.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.774
(laughs)
All right.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.144
I will leave you.
Have a good night.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.878
Good night, Goodwin.

17:25.978 --> 17:27.914
And... thanks.

17:28.014 --> 17:29.549
Thank you.

17:30.350 --> 17:31.551
Uh, it's Phyllis,
by the way.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.553
What?
My middle name.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.522
Still sharp as a tack.

17:35.622 --> 17:36.923
(laughing)

17:41.661 --> 17:45.565
Keep smiling, you son of
a bitch, I'm coming for you.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.808
Bob, your boat is awesome.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.277
It's our boat, buddy.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.212
When are we gonna
take it out on the lake?

17:59.312 --> 18:01.214
What, this isn't fun?

18:01.314 --> 18:02.949
Not really.

18:03.716 --> 18:06.153
I'm sorry, man,
you want to honk the horn?

18:07.987 --> 18:09.322
Not really.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.224
When I heard about this,

18:11.324 --> 18:12.225
I was worried
that you were having

18:12.325 --> 18:14.761
some kind of mental breakdown.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.095
But I was wrong.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.665
It is magical.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.067
We are sitting in his driveway.

18:21.168 --> 18:23.102
In a boat.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.871
In a boat!

18:24.971 --> 18:27.207
A toast to leaving
the workaday world behind

18:27.307 --> 18:28.808
and living the good life.

18:28.908 --> 18:30.943
(all toast)

18:31.811 --> 18:34.581
Mmm. Did you sign up
for your boating class?

18:34.681 --> 18:37.350
Nah, I got to learn
how to swim first.
