01:37.082 --> 01:40.562
Thank God.
Yes. Thank God.

01:42.242 --> 01:44.242
And you.

02:07.282 --> 02:09.321
How do we speak to him?
Normally.

02:09.322 --> 02:11.281
How do you think you speak to him?

02:11.282 --> 02:13.561
Do we pretend prison never happened?

02:13.562 --> 02:15.562
I don't think that'll be necessary.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.737
Welcome back, Mr Bates.

02:19.097 --> 02:22.416
I've waited a long time to say that.
Thank you, Mr Carson.

02:22.417 --> 02:24.417
Too long.
Give us your coat.

02:25.097 --> 02:28.336
Oh, Mrs Patmore, can you find
something for Mr Bates to eat?

02:28.337 --> 02:31.856
I certainly can. Daisy! Ivy!
Stir your stumps!

02:31.857 --> 02:33.577
Who's Ivy?
The new kitchen maid.

02:35.377 --> 02:38.337
Thomas. Still here, I see.

02:39.497 --> 02:42.336
Mr Barrow, now, Mr Bates.
And, yes, I'm still here.

02:42.337 --> 02:44.176
And busy as a bee.

02:44.177 --> 02:47.777
There have been some changes
since er... since you've been away.

02:47.897 --> 02:49.976
You will have heard
about Lady Sybil.

02:49.977 --> 02:51.976
Yes, I've heard.

02:51.977 --> 02:54.297
Anna took a letter from me
to her Ladyship.

02:54.937 --> 02:57.336
There we are.
Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

02:57.337 --> 02:59.176
Can we all have one of those?

02:59.177 --> 03:01.497
Welcome back, Mr Bates.
Thank you, Daisy.

03:03.297 --> 03:05.297
Something nice?

03:05.497 --> 03:08.856
The editor's written back,
repeating his offer.

03:08.857 --> 03:10.696
He asks if I'm ever in London.

03:10.697 --> 03:14.377
Why not? You could see Rosamund
and buy some new clothes.

03:14.737 --> 03:18.137
He only wants to persuade you
to write for his horrible paper.

03:19.097 --> 03:21.136
Still, I think I will go.

03:21.137 --> 03:25.176
It seems rude not to in a way and
I haven't been to London for ages.

03:25.177 --> 03:27.177
Excuse me.

03:29.617 --> 03:31.656
Please don't encourage her.

03:31.657 --> 03:33.657
I think it's a good idea.

03:34.817 --> 03:38.016
I gather you've trapped
poor old Jarvis into a meeting.

03:38.017 --> 03:40.376
It won't take long.
But he is the agent

03:40.377 --> 03:43.296
and there are things we must get
started on, if you agree.

03:43.297 --> 03:46.697
Well, I'm glad you still think
my agreement has a part to play.

03:50.857 --> 03:54.097
Are you sure you wouldn't rather
just cut and run, like me?

03:57.937 --> 04:00.657
Bates! My dear fellow!

04:01.057 --> 04:04.377
I didn't know you were here already!
They let you out at dawn.

04:04.577 --> 04:06.656
Thank you for sending
Anna in the car.

04:06.657 --> 04:08.816
Oh, nonsense.
Where have they put you?

04:08.817 --> 04:10.856
In my old room, m'lord.
That won't do.

04:10.857 --> 04:14.697
I'll ask Jarvis how far they've got
with finding a cottage. Thank you.

04:15.177 --> 04:18.815
About Thomas?
I'll sort it out, Bates. I promise.

04:18.817 --> 04:20.817
But in the meantime you just rest.

04:23.457 --> 04:25.457
Stay in bed. Read books.

04:46.097 --> 04:49.816
But you didn't walk out of my
luncheon when Robert asked you to.

04:49.817 --> 04:52.737
Well, that luncheon was
to support Cora in her grief.

04:53.937 --> 04:56.616
It did not seem appropriate
to let the whole thing

04:56.617 --> 04:59.376
end in chaos and a quarrel.

04:59.377 --> 05:02.296
So you don't think I should have
given Ethel a second chance?

05:02.297 --> 05:06.297
I do not criticise your motives,
but did you really consider?

05:06.777 --> 05:08.737
Ethel is notorious in the village.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.537
I don't think so.
I know so.

05:14.057 --> 05:17.016
You have surrounded this house
with a miasma of scandal

05:17.017 --> 05:19.057
and touched all of us
by association.

05:20.097 --> 05:22.736
I think one must fight
for one's beliefs.

05:22.737 --> 05:26.697
And is poor Ethel to be the cudgel
by which you fight your foes?

05:28.617 --> 05:30.617
Ah, Ethel.

05:34.137 --> 05:38.217
I was just telling Lady Grantham
how your cooking has come on.

05:39.137 --> 05:42.857
I'm studying, m'lady. These days,
a working woman must have a skill.

05:43.097 --> 05:45.097
But you seem to have so many.

05:50.537 --> 05:52.537
I don't see how you can
just sack him.

05:53.137 --> 05:55.176
He's done nothing wrong.

05:55.177 --> 05:58.736
He can't have expected to stay
my valet once Bates was released.

05:58.737 --> 06:00.737
Ask Carson. He'll have some ideas.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.897
Poor little girl.

06:07.257 --> 06:09.977
Has Branson said anything
more about moving out?

06:10.377 --> 06:13.816
How can he move before he's found
a job? How can you want him to?

06:13.817 --> 06:17.136
He's our responsibility now,
Robert - he and the baby.

06:17.137 --> 06:19.137
We owe that to Sybil.

06:20.897 --> 06:24.217
I must get on. I've got this
meeting with Jarvis and Matthew.

06:28.057 --> 06:30.057
Have you got any plans, Mr Bates?

06:30.857 --> 06:34.697
It's rather early to say. His
lordship suggested I have a rest.

06:35.497 --> 06:38.456
I expect you'll be looking
for something to do, Mr Barrow.

06:38.457 --> 06:40.457
Now that Mr Bates is back.

06:45.417 --> 06:48.736
They're showing a film tonight
in the village hall. Way Down East.

06:48.737 --> 06:51.256
It's about a woman
who survives in the wilderness

06:51.257 --> 06:54.816
through her own wits and courage.
Blimey. They've stolen my story!

06:54.817 --> 06:56.697
Lillian Gish is in it.
I like her.

06:56.698 --> 06:59.096
There's a late showing tonight
at half past ten,

06:59.097 --> 07:01.017
for the local servants.
What about it?

07:01.018 --> 07:03.536
Are you going Jimmy?
Sounds a bit soppy, to be honest.

07:03.537 --> 07:05.576
Well, I'm not going with
Alfred on my own.

07:05.577 --> 07:08.816
My mum wouldn't like it.
She would not and nor would I.

07:08.817 --> 07:12.016
You may go if Madge
or Alice will go with you.

07:12.017 --> 07:15.737
But not otherwise.
All right. If Mrs Patmore agrees.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.937
Straight there and back mind.

07:20.537 --> 07:24.136
This means the overhaul of every part
of the estate we hold in hand

07:24.137 --> 07:27.296
and some large new parcels
in addition.

07:27.297 --> 07:29.336
All in an instant.

07:29.337 --> 07:32.216
But don't you see?
If we invest in new machinery,

07:32.217 --> 07:34.776
new methods and new techniques,

07:34.777 --> 07:36.816
the whole estate must benefit by it.

07:36.817 --> 07:40.296
And as for taking new lands in hand,
we won't be running it separately.

07:40.297 --> 07:42.777
We'll find another use
for some of the farmhouses...

07:42.778 --> 07:47.136
This is ridiculous! Downton has
existed for hundreds of years
in perfect harmony.

07:47.137 --> 07:49.416
We have worked
with the farmers as partners.

07:49.417 --> 07:51.456
Now you want to blow it all
to smithereens!

07:51.457 --> 07:53.496
Of course I don't, but -
If I may, my Lord?

07:53.497 --> 07:57.296
Mr Crawley, you are very new
to our way of life here.

07:57.297 --> 07:59.336
I beg your pardon!

07:59.337 --> 08:02.416
There's no point biting Jarvis's
head off. You are new to it.

08:02.417 --> 08:05.856
Must I remind you of the state
the place was in a few months ago?

08:05.857 --> 08:08.457
That was nothing to do
with the way we run it!

08:09.137 --> 08:11.057
The money was lost
in a bad investment.

08:11.058 --> 08:15.216
And you've been bailing the place
out with Cora's fortune.
You have been for years.

08:15.217 --> 08:19.057
Downton must be self-supporting if
it's to have a chance of survival!

08:23.537 --> 08:27.177
Well, you've given us plenty to
think about. Hasn't he, Mr Jarvis?

08:28.017 --> 08:30.017
He has indeed, Lord Grantham.

09:02.297 --> 09:06.216
Why would I persuade your father
otherwise when I agree with him?

09:06.217 --> 09:10.336
How can you say that when you keep
telling me to find something to do?

09:10.337 --> 09:12.536
I meant run a local charity

09:12.537 --> 09:14.857
or paint watercolours or something.

09:15.297 --> 09:17.976
Well, I'm going to London
to see the editor tomorrow

09:17.977 --> 09:20.697
and if I like him
then I'm going to say yes.

09:21.137 --> 09:23.696
I don't want to fall out with Papa,

09:23.697 --> 09:25.897
but I don't want to be invisible
either.

09:26.617 --> 09:28.617
I've had enough of it.

09:29.297 --> 09:32.337
Very well. I'm coming up tonight.
I'll see what I can do.

09:33.697 --> 09:35.697
But I want a favour in return.

09:46.817 --> 09:49.657
Ethel? What's the matter?

09:50.657 --> 09:53.857
I had rather a nasty encounter
in the village, that's all.

09:54.377 --> 09:58.177
What sort of encounter?
Mrs Bakewell refused to serve me.

09:59.017 --> 10:01.817
In the end her husband did,
but it wasn't very nice.

10:02.217 --> 10:04.177
We shall take our business
elsewhere.

10:04.178 --> 10:06.536
There's no need for that, Ma'am.
I'm used to it.

10:06.537 --> 10:08.537
You shouldn't have to be.

10:15.097 --> 10:17.136
Are you all set for this evening?

10:17.137 --> 10:21.416
If you mean have I allowed Ivy to go
out when it's not her half day,

10:21.417 --> 10:23.656
I have, but why,
I could not tell you.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.696
Bring them all home safe.

10:25.697 --> 10:28.416
If that's Bechamel, why don't
you use parsley or mace?

10:28.417 --> 10:30.696
I do. But I boil it
in the milk beforehand.

10:30.697 --> 10:33.856
I made it last night.
Oh, leave her alone, you big ninnie.

10:33.857 --> 10:36.576
There's nothing wrong
with a man who can cook.

10:36.577 --> 10:39.016
Some say the best cooks
in the world are men.

10:39.017 --> 10:42.216
And do we think this sad beanpole
will be the best cook in the world?

10:42.217 --> 10:45.376
Why do you always feel the need
to be so unpleasant, James?

10:45.377 --> 10:47.377
What's Alfred ever done to you?

10:48.177 --> 10:50.696
Er... you can take in the fish
and meat tonight.

10:50.697 --> 10:52.697
James can follow with the sauce.

10:55.297 --> 10:58.056
But I should be the First Footman.
Of course you should.

10:58.057 --> 11:00.656
Listen to her!
You're taller than him!

11:00.657 --> 11:02.696
You've been here longer than him!

11:02.697 --> 11:06.137
Why are you taking her to the
pictures when she talks like that?

11:07.137 --> 11:09.177
Well, I've got the tickets now,
so...

11:16.857 --> 11:18.857
Don't get up.

11:29.457 --> 11:31.496
How's the Christening going?

11:31.497 --> 11:34.176
It's all arranged with
the Catholic Church in Ripon.

11:34.177 --> 11:36.216
Weren't you going to tell us?

11:36.217 --> 11:38.256
You and Matthew?

11:38.257 --> 11:40.697
I didn't think the others
would want to know.

11:42.897 --> 11:45.417
Please give them a chance
to behave properly.

11:59.657 --> 12:01.657
I wondered if you'd be a Godmother?

12:05.977 --> 12:07.816
Am I allowed to be?

12:07.817 --> 12:10.096
As long as at least one of them
is Catholic

12:10.097 --> 12:12.097
and my brother's coming over.

12:12.297 --> 12:14.297
He'll stay in the village.

12:14.697 --> 12:17.297
No, he won't. He'll stay here.

12:18.417 --> 12:20.456
He's a bit of a rough diamond.

12:20.457 --> 12:22.457
I'm very fond of diamonds.

12:45.297 --> 12:49.017
I still can't believe I'm here.
I keep pinching myself.

12:50.017 --> 12:52.017
Believe.

12:54.297 --> 12:56.336
Which one would be ours?

12:56.337 --> 13:00.576
Well, they won't move Mr Chirk
or the Tripps,

13:00.577 --> 13:03.897
but Mrs Bow wants to live in
the village, so we might get hers.

13:04.657 --> 13:07.736
None of which solves the problem
of what I'm going to do.

13:07.737 --> 13:11.176
Your job, of course. They'll have
to give Thomas his notice.

13:11.177 --> 13:13.857
Mr Barrow.
Mr 'Stick-It-Up-Your-Jumper'.

13:14.257 --> 13:16.257
He'll have to go.

13:17.897 --> 13:19.897
Revenge is sweet.

13:29.297 --> 13:31.376
Look at him.
He can't even balance it.

13:31.377 --> 13:33.697
Oh, leave him alone. Up you go.

13:35.137 --> 13:37.896
It's a flipping insult.
Just cos he's ten foot tall.

13:37.897 --> 13:39.976
You're right.
I've got a good mind to...

13:39.977 --> 13:41.977
Don't do anything you'll regret.

13:43.377 --> 13:47.017
These things can be managed,
but not by losing your temper.

13:53.097 --> 13:55.297
You make a cosy couple,
I must say.

13:57.977 --> 14:00.577
I don't think so.
It's not what I've heard.

14:01.137 --> 14:03.576
Alfred says he's always going on
about you.

14:03.577 --> 14:05.616
Silly sloppy stuff.

14:05.617 --> 14:07.976
Alfred's sick and tired of it
and no wonder.

14:07.977 --> 14:10.016
Well, he's making it up.

14:10.017 --> 14:12.017
Have it you own way.

14:24.257 --> 14:26.617
Right, don't put them like that.

14:28.297 --> 14:30.336
They've got to be able
to get hold of them.

14:30.337 --> 14:33.177
That's why I've asked
Mr Murray to come up.

14:33.857 --> 14:36.816
You've asked Murray to come here
without consulting me?

14:36.817 --> 14:39.897
I felt I wasn't explaining things
well and I know he can.

14:40.137 --> 14:42.137
Oh, lovely. What a treat.

14:44.097 --> 14:46.856
Oh my, your ladyship!
No, no fuss, no fuss.

14:46.857 --> 14:50.096
Just scrape me down
and get me a spare napkin.

14:50.097 --> 14:52.097
I'll take that.

14:52.977 --> 14:56.456
I saw your cook in the village
today, Isobel. She seemed upset.

14:56.457 --> 15:00.776
Yes. Mrs Bakewell was rather unkind.

15:00.777 --> 15:03.536
It seems a pity that even
in this pretty little village,

15:03.537 --> 15:05.576
people can be so unforgiving.

15:05.577 --> 15:08.617
Some people are unforgiving,
others are insensitive.

15:12.217 --> 15:14.177
What time do you leave in
the morning?

15:14.178 --> 15:17.656
I thought I'd get the ten o'clock.
I'm meeting him for tea.

15:17.657 --> 15:19.736
You're not encouraging this?

15:19.737 --> 15:21.776
She hasn't agreed to anything yet.

15:21.777 --> 15:25.616
Oh, Mama, talk to her. Talk to all
of them. Say something sensible.

15:25.617 --> 15:28.496
Yes. Let's hear how a woman's
place is in the home.

15:28.497 --> 15:31.816
I do think a woman's place
is eventually in the home,

15:31.817 --> 15:36.257
but I see no harm in her having
some fun before she gets there.

15:36.817 --> 15:38.817
Oh, Granny! Thank you!

15:39.097 --> 15:41.097
Have you changed your pills?

15:41.297 --> 15:44.656
And another thing. I mean,
Edith isn't getting any younger.

15:44.657 --> 15:47.697
Perhaps she isn't cut out
for domestic life.

15:52.097 --> 15:54.097
How are your plans proceeding, Tom?

15:54.617 --> 15:56.416
I was telling Lady Grantham.

15:56.417 --> 15:58.496
My brother has a garage
in Liverpool.

15:58.497 --> 16:02.056
He's asked me to go in with him.
The brother who's coming to stay?

16:02.057 --> 16:05.017
Yes. Kieran.
Why is he coming here?

16:05.177 --> 16:07.177
For the Christening.

16:11.297 --> 16:13.136
How did he rearrange the spoons?

16:13.137 --> 16:16.376
Right on the edge of my plate.
I'm not saying it was deliberate.

16:16.377 --> 16:18.736
I hope you're not,
cos I was trying to help.

16:18.737 --> 16:22.056
Well, I think Alfred can manage
without your help in future, James.

16:22.057 --> 16:25.497
And next time, will you wait to be
asked before you take charge?

16:25.937 --> 16:27.976
Are you still here?

16:27.977 --> 16:30.936
Perhaps Alfred no longer wants
to go to the pictures.

16:30.937 --> 16:33.616
He may want to ponder
his mistakes instead.

16:33.617 --> 16:35.697
Of course they're going.
Are we?

16:37.857 --> 16:41.536
Yes, you can go.
I will not withdraw my permission.

16:41.537 --> 16:44.376
But as you walk,
you might contemplate what it is

16:44.377 --> 16:46.377
to waste a chance when it is given.

16:50.657 --> 16:52.657
I suppose you never wasted a chance.

16:52.977 --> 16:56.696
Well, if I did, I learnt from it
and that's all I am asking from him.

16:56.697 --> 16:59.777
That and some ritual humiliation.

17:09.377 --> 17:12.377
You shouldn't have rung Murray
without telling Papa.

17:12.857 --> 17:16.175
You berate me for not wanting
to take responsibility

17:16.176 --> 17:18.497
and now you tell me off
for doing just that.

17:18.936 --> 17:21.217
You can't have it both ways.

17:21.497 --> 17:23.497
I can if I want to.

17:30.337 --> 17:33.257
What's the matter?
Do you think I should see someone?

17:34.337 --> 17:37.777
What? If there's anything wrong
then it's obviously my fault.

17:38.697 --> 17:41.137
You know what they told us
when I was wounded.

17:41.457 --> 17:43.457
But they were wrong. They said so.

17:45.057 --> 17:47.057
I wonder.

17:47.377 --> 17:51.216
Darling, please don't worry.
I'm sure there's nothing wrong.

17:51.217 --> 17:53.857
That's the point. We're not sure.

17:59.297 --> 18:02.417
It was OK, but I prefer
English films with English stars.

18:02.577 --> 18:04.416
They seem more real somehow.

18:04.417 --> 18:08.056
I like the American actors.
They've got more you-know-what.

18:08.057 --> 18:10.416
Oh, and how about Ivy Close
in The Worldlings?

18:10.417 --> 18:13.416
She makes Lilian Gish look like
a village school ma'am.

18:13.417 --> 18:15.376
Ivy Close.

18:15.377 --> 18:18.296
It's funny to think of a film star
having your own name.

18:18.297 --> 18:22.177
There aren't any with my name.
No, but there's a King.

18:22.737 --> 18:24.776
The one who burnt the cakes.

18:24.777 --> 18:27.857
Well, I hope I won't be burning
any of my cakes in future.

18:30.457 --> 18:32.817
Where is everyone?
They've gone to bed.

18:33.777 --> 18:36.497
Except for the picture-goers.
They're not back.

18:36.577 --> 18:39.017
If I'd thrown a bucket of slop
in the old lady's lap,

18:39.018 --> 18:41.257
I wouldn't be allowed
to go to the flicks.

18:41.337 --> 18:43.937
What are you saying?
Mr Carson doesn't like me.

18:44.137 --> 18:46.696
No matter what Alfred does,
he still prefers him.

18:46.697 --> 18:48.817
It's not bloody fair.
Well, I love you.

18:49.137 --> 18:52.617
Well, if you do, you're on your own.
I'm sure I'm not.

18:56.537 --> 18:58.776
What about your family?
Where are you from?

18:58.777 --> 19:02.136
I don't have any family,
not really. Cousins. You know.

19:02.137 --> 19:04.817
No-one else.
And your mum and dad?

19:05.457 --> 19:08.296
Dead. My dad was killed in the war

19:08.297 --> 19:10.297
and my mother died of the flu.

19:10.537 --> 19:13.377
I haven't any brothers
and sisters, so here we are.

19:13.937 --> 19:15.937
All on me ownsome.

19:16.017 --> 19:18.377
You must get lonely.
Meaning?

19:19.337 --> 19:22.097
I know what it's like, that's all.

19:22.857 --> 19:24.857
Funny. We're quite a pair.

19:25.857 --> 19:28.016
We both like to look very sure
of ourselves,

19:28.017 --> 19:30.336
but we're not so sure underneath,
are we?

19:30.337 --> 19:32.376
Still you've no need to worry.

19:32.377 --> 19:35.176
Mr Carson may prefer Alfred,
but nobody else does.

19:35.177 --> 19:37.216
Don't they? I wonder.

19:37.217 --> 19:39.896
Sometimes I think
it's just Jimmy Contra Mundi.

19:39.897 --> 19:43.816
Is that Latin? I should try and tell
Mr Carson - make up some points.

19:43.817 --> 19:45.937
Never mind Latin,
I need a magic spell.

19:47.857 --> 19:49.857
Good night.

19:54.977 --> 19:56.977
He's a funny one, isn't he?

19:58.817 --> 20:00.777
You can't pull the wool
over my eyes.

20:01.457 --> 20:04.416
I know what's going on.
You're quite wrong, Miss O'Brien.

20:04.417 --> 20:06.456
He's a proper little ladies' man.

20:06.457 --> 20:08.496
If that's how you want to play it.

20:08.497 --> 20:11.056
What are you going on about?!
There's no need to bark.

20:11.057 --> 20:13.057
I only know what Alfred tells me.

20:14.657 --> 20:17.697
Well, if he says Jimmy's
interested in me, he's lying.

20:18.417 --> 20:20.417
Would he?

20:21.257 --> 20:23.257
Is it supposed to be a secret?

21:16.257 --> 21:19.057
Oh, you are daft!

21:20.177 --> 21:23.976
Oh, Ivy, I love to be out
with you like this.

21:23.977 --> 21:26.177
I wish we could make it
a regular thing.

21:27.417 --> 21:31.177
I can't. I wouldn't want you
to get the wrong idea.

21:32.497 --> 21:35.297
Look, I'm sorry,
but Jimmy's just not interested.

21:35.537 --> 21:38.377
I hate to hurt your feelings
like that, but he's not.

21:38.777 --> 21:43.257
You don't know that.
He flirts with me. He does.

21:44.737 --> 21:48.257
If you knew he wasn't interested,
would that make a difference?

21:49.617 --> 21:51.617
I'd have to hear it from his lips.

23:17.257 --> 23:19.817
Sorry to wake you, Jimmy, but...

23:20.337 --> 23:23.457
Oh, my... Get off!
Just get the bloody hell off me!

23:24.697 --> 23:26.736
Alfred, it's not what you think.

23:26.737 --> 23:29.776
Don't do that. Please.
Alfred doesn't matter.

23:29.777 --> 23:32.217
No-one will believe a word
he says. He's nothing.

23:32.218 --> 23:34.776
What are you doing?
Why are you in here?

23:34.777 --> 23:37.816
Because of what you said.
Because of all there is between us.

23:37.817 --> 23:40.856
There's nothing between us!
Except my fist if you don't get out!

23:40.857 --> 23:42.896
And if you tell any...

23:42.897 --> 23:44.896
But what about the things you said?

23:44.897 --> 23:47.857
I said nothing except
get out. Go on! Get out, Thomas!

23:50.737 --> 23:54.256
What is going on?
Nothing, Mr Carson.

23:54.257 --> 23:58.377
Jimmy, er... James had a nightmare.
He's fine, now.

24:32.196 --> 24:34.196
What is it? What's going on?

24:34.636 --> 24:37.315
James? What's the matter with you?

24:37.316 --> 24:39.316
Nothing.
Alfred?

24:39.876 --> 24:43.076
Ask Mr Barrow.
It's nothing. Really.

24:43.676 --> 24:45.676
It doesn't seem like nothing.

24:49.516 --> 24:53.875
Ivy? Never mind the toast, you look
very tasty yourself, this morning.

24:53.876 --> 24:57.635
What did you say?
Can't a red-blooded man
compliment a pretty girl?

24:57.636 --> 24:59.636
Not at breakfast for Heaven's sake!

25:02.516 --> 25:05.515
Alfred, what's happened?
Not now.

25:05.516 --> 25:07.715
Well, if there is anything
I ought to know,

25:07.716 --> 25:10.236
I hope I hear about it
before the end of the day.

25:31.396 --> 25:33.596
This really has been so interesting.

25:35.836 --> 25:38.355
I hope this means
you're persuadable, Lady Edith?

25:38.356 --> 25:40.796
I'll think about it, I promise.

25:41.396 --> 25:44.875
I just felt I had to meet you
and see what it would be like.

25:44.876 --> 25:46.715
I assume your father disapproves.

25:46.716 --> 25:49.755
Well, it's the business of
parents to worry, isn't it?

25:49.756 --> 25:53.195
No, all sorts of toffs are writing
for magazines nowadays.

25:53.196 --> 25:56.836
Some of them even advertise face
creams, cigarettes and the rest.

25:57.076 --> 26:00.156
I'm afraid Papa would not
find that reassuring.

26:00.916 --> 26:03.835
In fact, if he were here
he'd probably just shout, 'Run!'

26:03.836 --> 26:06.955
Will you please make up your own
mind without his advice?

26:06.956 --> 26:09.396
I'll have to think about that too.

26:11.596 --> 26:13.755
Are you going back
to Yorkshire tonight?

26:13.756 --> 26:15.756
No. I'm staying with my aunt.

26:16.036 --> 26:19.195
I've got to look in to the offices
of The Lady while I'm here.

26:19.196 --> 26:21.035
Not to write for them, I trust?

26:21.036 --> 26:24.235
Oh, no. It's just something
I promised to do for my grandmother.

26:24.236 --> 26:26.715
The Lady? That's Covent Garden?
Here's an idea.

26:26.716 --> 26:29.275
Let's er, let's have lunch
tomorrow at Rules.

26:29.276 --> 26:31.196
If you accept the job
we'll celebrate.

26:31.197 --> 26:33.796
If it's a no, I'll drown my sorrows.
How's that?

26:36.716 --> 26:38.956
You seem nervous today, Barrow.

26:41.476 --> 26:44.876
We will get things sorted out.
We won't leave you in the lurch.

26:47.036 --> 26:50.756
I'd be grateful if you could let me
know when you've made a decision.

26:50.956 --> 26:52.836
I'll talk things through
with Carson

26:52.837 --> 26:54.876
and we'll see what we can
come up with.

26:58.036 --> 27:00.955
It makes no sense to retain
this bit as a separate section.

27:00.956 --> 27:02.795
No sense at all.

27:02.796 --> 27:06.035
But of course Jarvis won't see that
because he hates change.

27:06.036 --> 27:08.955
Just try to carry Papa
with you. That's all I ask.

27:08.956 --> 27:12.115
He'll be with me in the end because
this is the only way forward

27:12.116 --> 27:14.355
and at some point
he's going to see that.

27:14.356 --> 27:16.395
Some point in the near
future I hope.

27:16.396 --> 27:20.115
What's the matter with you both? You
were in a dream all through dinner.

27:20.116 --> 27:22.116
Nothing's the matter!

27:22.876 --> 27:25.115
Does Mr Murray
want luncheon tomorrow?

27:25.116 --> 27:27.995
No. He's in York all morning.
He'll come up here afterwards.

27:27.996 --> 27:30.116
Followed by Tom's brother
for dinner.

27:30.716 --> 27:33.395
So it promises to be
a day of contrast.

27:33.396 --> 27:35.435
God in heaven.

27:35.436 --> 27:37.795
What do you think, Tom?
I agree with Matthew.

27:37.796 --> 27:40.795
The estate can offer proper
compensation to the tenants now

27:40.796 --> 27:43.355
while the money's there.
But if we miss this chance

27:43.356 --> 27:45.676
it may not come again.
So says the Marxist.

27:46.436 --> 27:49.755
If you don't mind me saying so,
you have a narrow view of socialism.

27:49.756 --> 27:52.475
You seem to have a very broad
interpretation of it.

27:52.476 --> 27:54.515
Now, now, children.

27:54.516 --> 27:58.155
If Branson is watering down
his revolutionary fervour,

27:58.156 --> 28:00.156
let us give thanks.
Tom.

28:01.196 --> 28:04.075
Do you know anything about farming,
Tom?

28:04.076 --> 28:07.556
A little. My grandfather
was a sheep farmer in Ireland.

28:09.556 --> 28:12.275
Why do you keep giving me funny
looks? I'm not.

28:12.276 --> 28:14.155
What's going on?

28:14.156 --> 28:16.835
Have you both been up to
something I don't know about?

28:16.836 --> 28:18.836
Not both of us.

28:24.036 --> 28:26.036
Are you awake?

28:26.596 --> 28:30.996
I can't seem to get
to sleep. I don't know why.

28:33.636 --> 28:37.956
Could you credit Matthew summoning
Murray without my permission?

28:38.556 --> 28:42.036
You keep telling everyone
Downton's a Dual Monarchy now.

28:43.036 --> 28:45.716
I never realised you didn't mean it.

28:46.796 --> 28:50.795
So, you're against me over Matthew,
the Christening and Edith.

28:50.796 --> 28:52.796
Robert...

28:54.116 --> 28:56.956
even your mother spoke up
for Edith. Think of that.

28:58.156 --> 29:00.276
A facer, I admit.

29:00.796 --> 29:03.475
She'll have had some reason
of her own, of course.

29:03.476 --> 29:05.476
Is she really so Machiavellian?

29:07.116 --> 29:09.116
Yes.

29:23.796 --> 29:25.955
I was afraid you'd stood me up.

29:25.956 --> 29:28.916
I'm so sorry.
It took much longer than I thought.

29:29.476 --> 29:32.475
What was it about?
Oh, just family stuff.

29:32.476 --> 29:34.555
An errand for my grandmother.

29:34.556 --> 29:36.556
Are you very family minded?

29:37.116 --> 29:41.795
Well, when you live at home
with your parents, you're still
in the middle of all of it.

29:41.796 --> 29:45.915
I saw a picture in the paper
of your elder sister's wedding.
She looked glamorous.

29:45.916 --> 29:47.755
People say so.

29:47.756 --> 29:50.675
Am I allowed to say I'm rather
pleased you're not married?

29:50.676 --> 29:52.515
I'm a little less pleased.

29:52.516 --> 29:55.716
Oh, dear. It sounds like
you're hiding a romantic secret.

29:56.236 --> 29:58.275
Not too romantic.

29:58.276 --> 30:01.395
A little while ago,
I was jilted at the altar.

30:01.396 --> 30:04.195
Which wasn't much fun.
Oh dear, I am sorry.

30:04.196 --> 30:06.235
Oh, please don't be.

30:06.236 --> 30:09.315
It's a relief to be reminded
I'm not an object of pity

30:09.316 --> 30:11.355
to the entire world.

30:11.356 --> 30:14.835
I've clearly put my foot in it,
and now you'll turn the job down.

30:14.836 --> 30:17.676
Please don't.
I won't.

30:18.156 --> 30:20.156
Not if you don't want me to.

30:21.756 --> 30:23.756
Ah.

30:24.756 --> 30:27.875
Surely, Lord Grantham,
you don't question Mr Crawley's goal

30:27.876 --> 30:30.355
of making the estate
self-sufficient? No.

30:30.356 --> 30:33.395
But I question his plans
for the employees and tenants

30:33.396 --> 30:35.235
in order to achieve it.

30:35.236 --> 30:37.555
Can't we allow things
to evolve more gently,

30:37.556 --> 30:40.435
as we did in the past?
The past is not much of a model.

30:40.436 --> 30:42.755
The third Earl nearly went bankrupt,

30:42.756 --> 30:45.035
the fourth only saved the estate
by dying

30:45.036 --> 30:47.075
and what would you all have done
in the '90s

30:47.076 --> 30:49.115
without Lady Grantham's money?

30:49.116 --> 30:51.715
I say, Murray. When I asked you
to say what you think,

30:51.716 --> 30:54.755
I didn't mean to be taken literally.
Must we talk in this way?

30:54.756 --> 30:56.756
Yes, I'm afraid so.

30:57.036 --> 30:59.315
Thanks to Mr Swire
we have another chance,

30:59.316 --> 31:01.316
but we have to change our ways.

31:01.676 --> 31:05.875
All I'm talking about is investment,
increasing productivity

31:05.876 --> 31:08.395
and reducing waste.
Waste?!

31:08.396 --> 31:11.675
Yes. The estate has been run
very wastefully for many years.

31:11.676 --> 31:13.915
I won't listen to this!
Now, come on, Jarvis.

31:13.916 --> 31:16.915
If I can listen to it, so can you.
No, Lord Grantham, I can't!

31:16.916 --> 31:20.355
Am I to stand here,
after 40 years of loyal service,

31:20.356 --> 31:24.115
to be accused of malfeasance
and corruption!

31:24.116 --> 31:28.435
Nothing of the sort!
My dear chap. Think for a moment.

31:28.436 --> 31:31.035
We must both see things
have to move forward.

31:31.036 --> 31:33.595
My goal is to find the way
of least disruption.

31:33.596 --> 31:35.396
Won't you stay and help
me with that?

31:35.397 --> 31:37.756
My Lord, will you give me
a good reference?

31:40.556 --> 31:42.395
Yes, of course I will.

31:42.396 --> 31:46.876
Mr Jarvis, if I have offended you,
then I offer my sincerest apologies.

31:47.716 --> 31:50.716
I am the old broom, Mr Crawley.

31:51.556 --> 31:53.556
You are the new.

31:53.636 --> 31:56.996
I wish you luck with your sweeping.
M'lord.

32:10.356 --> 32:12.916
Mr Carson, you'd better come.

32:15.956 --> 32:18.515
May I help you?
This is Mr Branson's brother.

32:18.516 --> 32:20.795
Can we fetch Mr Branson, sir?

32:20.796 --> 32:23.796
I've already sent Alfred.
Here they are now.

32:28.356 --> 32:31.795
Kieran? What are you doing
down here? Come upstairs.

32:31.796 --> 32:35.276
I don't fancy it. Can I not stay
put and have my dinner down here?

32:36.236 --> 32:40.275
But we're all so looking forward
to meeting you, Mr Branson.

32:40.276 --> 32:44.036
If you come with us, you can see
your room and get changed.

32:44.716 --> 32:48.716
If you want to. And what would I
change into? A pumpkin?

32:53.596 --> 32:56.715
Come on, Tommy.
Come and eat down here.

32:56.716 --> 32:59.435
They seem like a nice lot.
What's the matter?

32:59.436 --> 33:01.795
Are you too grand for them now?

33:01.796 --> 33:03.795
They know that I'm not,

33:03.796 --> 33:07.875
but my mother-in-law has been
kind enough to invite you to stay
and dine.

33:07.876 --> 33:11.116
And I'll not let you
snub her. Now, get a move on.

33:31.916 --> 33:36.235
I know. You always said he would
bring shame on this house.

33:36.236 --> 33:39.515
No, Mrs Hughes.
For once, I will hold my tongue.

33:39.516 --> 33:44.316
I thought Mr Branson's respect for
her ladyship's invitation exemplary.

33:46.236 --> 33:50.196
Well. 'Mr' Branson's done
something right, for a change.

33:50.796 --> 33:52.796
Miracles can happen.

33:54.636 --> 33:56.636
How was it?

33:59.076 --> 34:02.275
Pretty bad. Jarvis has resigned.

34:02.276 --> 34:05.155
What?
He's gone

34:05.156 --> 34:08.076
and I'm going to have to make it
all work or I've had it.

34:10.596 --> 34:12.596
Come here.

34:13.716 --> 34:15.716
You'll make me untidy.

34:16.275 --> 34:18.275
Good.

34:21.156 --> 34:23.514
You see, I know it's right, Mary.

34:23.516 --> 34:26.675
I believe I can make Downton safe
for our children,

34:26.676 --> 34:28.676
if we ever have any.

34:29.436 --> 34:31.476
But I can only do it
if you're with me.

34:33.036 --> 34:35.876
But what about Papa? I do love him.

34:37.076 --> 34:39.155
Love him by all means,

34:39.156 --> 34:41.156
but believe in me.

34:50.235 --> 34:52.876
There. Will that convince you?

34:54.235 --> 34:56.235
Convince me again.

35:06.356 --> 35:09.476
And don't say,
'If we ever have any.'

35:10.076 --> 35:12.076
Because we will.

35:19.989 --> 35:21.989
But it's been a while now.

35:23.149 --> 35:27.188
What if Mr Carson finds out you knew
all along and you never told him?

35:27.189 --> 35:29.948
How will that look?
Surely it's for Jimmy to tell?

35:29.949 --> 35:31.988
Supposing he's in on it?

35:31.989 --> 35:34.868
No. He started yelling
at Thomas as soon as I walked in.

35:34.869 --> 35:37.669
Yes, I'm sure he did.
As soon as you walked in.

35:38.131 --> 35:40.131
What if you hadn't walked in?

35:41.011 --> 35:44.970
I'm sorry, Alfred. Mr Carson won't
tolerate these sort of shenanigans

35:44.971 --> 35:48.371
and he'll be furious if he finds out
you knew and said nothing.

35:49.691 --> 35:52.251
You need to speak up.
For your own good.

36:08.011 --> 36:10.650
And what exactly does this business
consist of?

36:10.651 --> 36:12.730
Automobile refurbishment.

36:12.731 --> 36:14.731
He means car repairs.

36:15.851 --> 36:18.690
I see. And you would live nearby?

36:18.691 --> 36:20.530
We've rooms over the garage.

36:20.531 --> 36:22.690
There's a bit of a park
not too far away.

36:22.691 --> 36:24.730
Well, that's something.

36:24.731 --> 36:26.931
I remember an evening
rather like this.

36:27.291 --> 36:30.050
We were travelling back
from Scotland to London

36:30.051 --> 36:33.330
when the train was suddenly engulfed
by a blizzard

36:33.331 --> 36:37.211
and we spent the night in a
tradesmen's hotel in Middlesbrough.

36:38.851 --> 36:42.770
So who's coming to the Christening?
All of us, I expect.

36:42.771 --> 36:46.330
Granny? Well, yes.
If Branson... Tom wants me to.

36:46.331 --> 36:48.770
I would be honoured.
Robert, are you coming?

36:48.771 --> 36:51.610
Tom doesn't want me there
and I wouldn't know what to do.

36:51.611 --> 36:53.730
All that crossing
and bobbing up and down.

36:53.731 --> 36:57.331
I went to a Mass once in Rome, it
was more like a gymnastic display.

36:59.731 --> 37:01.850
I would like you
to be there very much.

37:01.851 --> 37:03.691
Why? What difference would it make?

37:03.692 --> 37:06.331
All I know is Sybil
would want you there.

37:07.731 --> 37:09.650
She loved you with all her heart

37:09.651 --> 37:11.651
and she would want you there.

37:16.411 --> 37:18.411
Will you argue with that?

37:20.851 --> 37:22.851
Not if you think it's so important.

37:23.771 --> 37:25.850
How did you get on in London?

37:25.851 --> 37:28.090
Well, as a matter of fact,

37:28.091 --> 37:30.130
I've got an announcement to make.

37:30.131 --> 37:32.131
Now is as good a time as any.

37:33.131 --> 37:35.131
Listen, everyone.

37:35.891 --> 37:38.371
You have a journalist in the family.

37:39.491 --> 37:43.010
Since we have a country solicitor
and a car mechanic,

37:43.011 --> 37:45.011
it's only a matter of time.

37:47.211 --> 37:49.131
How was the editor in the end?

37:49.811 --> 37:52.891
Oh, nice, very nice.

37:55.171 --> 37:57.210
So you're ready to speak out?

37:57.211 --> 38:01.210
I think you're right and I must.

38:01.211 --> 38:05.370
Good. He has broken all
the fundamental laws of God and man.

38:05.371 --> 38:09.131
Report him as you should and then
stand back and enjoy his fall.

38:10.771 --> 38:12.771
I don't understand.

38:12.851 --> 38:15.810
You've placed an advertisement
in a magazine,

38:15.811 --> 38:19.330
to find a job for my housekeeper?
I knew you'd be against it.

38:19.331 --> 38:23.131
Well, how would you feel if I found
other work for your cook or butler?

38:23.371 --> 38:27.210
Granny feels that for Ethel's sake
she should move elsewhere.

38:27.211 --> 38:30.090
Oh, nonsense. She couldn't
give tuppence about Ethel

38:30.091 --> 38:32.090
or anyone like her!

38:32.091 --> 38:35.211
You've been reading those
Communist newspapers again.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.770
I don't suppose there's any beer?

38:38.771 --> 38:41.570
Haven't you had enough?
Of course we have beer.

38:41.571 --> 38:43.970
We must have some somewhere. Carson?

38:43.971 --> 38:47.010
I believe so, m'lady. I'll fetch it.

38:47.011 --> 38:50.210
What's the betting we'll have
a chorus of Molly Malone

38:50.211 --> 38:54.451
before we finish? You're the one
pushing Tom into his brother's arms.

38:54.931 --> 38:59.171
This is not what Sybil wanted
for him. She told me.

39:00.851 --> 39:04.250
Oh, Carson. Would you ask Mrs Hughes
to meet me in the hall, please?

39:04.251 --> 39:08.770
Very good, m'lady. I'll bring
the beer in a moment, sir.

39:08.771 --> 39:10.771
It isn't so bad here, after all.

39:13.491 --> 39:17.130
I don't know.
She just asked if you could go up.

39:17.131 --> 39:19.131
I suppose I'll have to.

39:19.371 --> 39:21.251
What's this?
They said we could go.

39:21.252 --> 39:23.290
They'll ring when they need the car.

39:23.291 --> 39:26.651
Mr Carson, might I have a word?
Well, I have to take this up.

39:28.331 --> 39:30.331
Oh, very well then. Come with me.

39:31.411 --> 39:34.290
Mrs Hughes, you have always
taken an interest in Ethel.

39:34.291 --> 39:36.291
Do you think I'm wrong?
No.

39:37.931 --> 39:41.250
While Ethel is in this village
she is doomed to be lonely.

39:41.251 --> 39:45.850
But if, as her ladyship suggests, she
can get a job far away from here...

39:45.851 --> 39:49.730
She's not a bad cook now
and with a respectable reference,

39:49.731 --> 39:51.770
which of course you can give her...

39:51.771 --> 39:56.490
I can't get over how you've planned
all this without a word to me.

39:56.491 --> 40:00.091
Well, I knew you wouldn't agree.
I know how you hate facing facts.

40:00.851 --> 40:04.091
I resent that. I'm sorry, but I do.

40:04.931 --> 40:09.651
Mrs Crawley, I hope you don't see
me as an intolerant person.

40:10.411 --> 40:13.331
No.
Because I agree with her ladyship.

40:14.171 --> 40:17.370
In a new place,
where she can start again,

40:17.371 --> 40:19.450
Ethel has far more chance
of happiness

40:19.451 --> 40:24.051
than in re-enacting her own version
of The Scarlet Letter in Downton.

40:24.811 --> 40:26.811
What is The Scarlet Letter?

40:27.171 --> 40:29.970
A novel. By Nathaniel Hawthorne.

40:29.971 --> 40:31.971
It sounds most unsuitable.

40:34.891 --> 40:36.891
I'll talk to Ethel.

40:42.411 --> 40:46.810
I don't understand what you're
saying. Thomas was doing what?

40:46.811 --> 40:50.330
That's what I saw, Mr Carson.
And what was James doing?

40:50.331 --> 40:52.370
I think he was asleep,

40:52.371 --> 40:55.290
because he just woke
and he got very angry...

40:55.291 --> 40:57.130
As he should have been, by God.

40:57.131 --> 41:00.170
My auntie says he might have been
faking because I walked in,

41:00.171 --> 41:02.010
but it didn't look fake to me.

41:02.011 --> 41:05.851
Well, we can always rely on your
aunt to take the ungenerous view.

41:09.571 --> 41:13.090
You will not speak of this
to anyone. Is that clear?

41:13.091 --> 41:15.770
I don't want to hear the subject
even mentioned

41:15.771 --> 41:18.851
in the Servants' Hall.
Very good, Mr Carson.

41:19.651 --> 41:22.370
The world can be a shocking place,
Alfred,

41:22.371 --> 41:25.611
but you are a man now and you must
learn to take it on the chin.

41:34.491 --> 41:37.090
Beg pardon, Ma'am. I was miles away.
That's all right.

41:37.091 --> 41:39.530
I just wanted to let you
know that I was back.

41:39.531 --> 41:41.930
Would you like some tea?
No, thank you.

41:41.931 --> 41:43.931
I'm going straight to bed.

41:48.091 --> 41:50.091
Ethel...

41:51.371 --> 41:53.371
are you happy?

41:54.611 --> 41:58.971
Well, I... I suppose I'm happy
compared to what I was before.

41:59.171 --> 42:01.171
You see I...

42:03.371 --> 42:05.371
Never mind.

42:05.771 --> 42:07.771
Good night.

42:13.211 --> 42:16.770
How can I still be here when
all the young have gone to bed?

42:16.771 --> 42:19.650
The motor's ready when you are.
When is Jarvis leaving?

42:19.651 --> 42:21.651
I'm not sure.

42:22.011 --> 42:24.531
It seems a poor return
for 40 years of service.

42:25.491 --> 42:29.370
Maybe. But he was your father's man.

42:29.371 --> 42:33.811
To him, you were always
the young master, never the Chief.

42:34.291 --> 42:37.850
Which does not alter the fact
that now we must find someone else.

42:37.851 --> 42:40.490
But you've already found him.
What do you mean?

42:40.491 --> 42:43.850
Well, obviously the answer
to a thousand different questions

42:43.851 --> 42:46.371
is to give the position to Branson.

42:47.171 --> 42:50.370
Tom.
Well if he's the agent,

42:50.371 --> 42:52.811
we can call him Branson again,
thank heaven.

42:52.931 --> 42:55.771
That's a mad plan.
It's not.

42:56.131 --> 42:58.690
Tom and Matthew can work
on the new ideas together.

42:58.691 --> 43:01.450
They're the same age.
But what does he know of farming?

43:01.451 --> 43:04.370
His grandfather was a farmer.
In a small way.

43:04.371 --> 43:08.091
Which means he has more practical
experience than Jarvis ever had.

43:08.491 --> 43:10.491
Think of the child.

43:10.771 --> 43:13.330
You cannot want
your only granddaughter

43:13.331 --> 43:17.331
to grow up in a garage
with that drunken gorilla?

43:18.451 --> 43:20.451
Don't we owe this to Sybil?

43:22.451 --> 43:25.210
I'll do it on one condition.
No, two.

43:25.211 --> 43:27.450
First, Matthew must agree.
He will.

43:27.451 --> 43:31.210
Second, you will both admit it
when you realise you were wrong.

43:31.211 --> 43:34.290
Oh, well, that is an easy
caveat to accept

43:34.291 --> 43:36.291
because I'm never wrong.

43:39.291 --> 43:42.331
I don't need to tell you
that this is a criminal offence.

43:42.691 --> 43:44.691
We hadn't done anything.

43:44.771 --> 43:47.810
But you were hoping to do something
if Alfred hadn't come in.

43:47.811 --> 43:51.170
It's not against the law to hope.
Don't you get clever with me

43:51.171 --> 43:53.171
when you should be horsewhipped!

43:59.371 --> 44:01.410
Do you have a defence?

44:01.411 --> 44:03.411
Am I mistaken in any part of this?

44:04.451 --> 44:09.171
Not really, Mr Carson.
As for a defence, what can I say?

44:10.011 --> 44:12.810
I was... very drawn to him

44:12.811 --> 44:15.811
and I'd got the impression
that he felt the same way.

44:16.491 --> 44:18.490
I was wrong.

44:18.491 --> 44:20.531
It seems an odd mistake to make.

44:21.371 --> 44:23.410
When you're like me, Mr Carson,

44:23.411 --> 44:27.850
you have to read the signs as best
you can because no one dares
speak out.

44:27.851 --> 44:31.331
I do not wish to take a tour
of your revolting world.

44:32.131 --> 44:34.131
No.

44:34.731 --> 44:37.570
So, are you saying

44:37.571 --> 44:41.170
that James is the innocent party
in all this?

44:41.171 --> 44:43.171
Yes, Mr Carson, he is.

44:44.331 --> 44:46.370
I will take time to consider.

44:46.371 --> 44:49.010
We must first find out
what James intends to do.

44:49.011 --> 44:52.131
He'd be within his rights
to report you to the police.

44:54.291 --> 44:56.931
Although I'm quite sure
it won't come to that.

44:58.931 --> 45:03.570
Will you give me your word
that nothing had happened?

45:03.571 --> 45:05.570
I will, yes.

45:05.571 --> 45:07.611
Right. Good night.

45:16.811 --> 45:18.850
Mr Barrow looks very grim faced.

45:18.851 --> 45:21.011
Never mind him.

45:22.211 --> 45:25.491
Human nature's a funny business,
isn't it?

45:26.771 --> 45:30.050
Now why didn't the poets
come to you, Mr Carson?

45:30.051 --> 45:33.091
They'd have saved themselves
a lot of time and trouble.

45:38.851 --> 45:40.891
What's this?
I hope you don't mind.

45:41.571 --> 45:45.090
If you could all
form a group around the father.

45:45.091 --> 45:48.011
Kieran. Right, Mama,
do you want to go next to Isobel?

45:57.851 --> 46:00.091
It seems so strange
without Sybil here.

46:02.131 --> 46:04.411
She's watching. I know.

46:05.371 --> 46:07.371
I envy you. I wish I did.

46:08.211 --> 46:11.011
Ever so slightly, thank you so much.

46:11.771 --> 46:14.850
You want me to take on the running
of the estate? It's a big job.

46:14.851 --> 46:17.570
Think of it as a Christening
present from Sybil.

46:17.571 --> 46:20.611
It's a wonderful idea, Tom.
I'm ashamed it wasn't mine.

46:22.571 --> 46:25.570
Perhaps one with
the grandfather holding the baby?

46:25.571 --> 46:27.931
And maybe the great
grandmother with him?

46:34.131 --> 46:37.211
And what about Father Dominic
who Christened her?

46:44.731 --> 46:46.770
What's the matter, Robert?

46:46.771 --> 46:50.171
Are you afraid you'll be converted
while you're not looking?

46:51.305 --> 46:57.195
