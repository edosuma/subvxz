WEBVTT

00:29.405 --> 00:30.655
Dear Dad,

00:31.281 --> 00:32.865
in your last letter,
you questioned whether

00:32.950 --> 00:35.201
it's my responsibility
to join this fight.

00:37.329 --> 00:38.705
The truth is

00:39.123 --> 00:41.999
we all became responsible
the day we created the Cylons.

00:45.129 --> 00:48.256
We're the ones who let these
robots become our servants,

00:48.465 --> 00:51.134
our trusted helpers
and even our friends.

00:51.260 --> 00:52.510
We let them into our lives,

00:52.594 --> 00:54.220
only to see them
repay our trust

00:54.304 --> 00:56.222
with a violent revolt
against us.

00:59.727 --> 01:02.311
I know there's a lot of
debate about why they hate us.

01:04.272 --> 01:07.525
But in the end,
does it really matter?

01:08.485 --> 01:10.820
Kill the enemy or be killed.

01:11.280 --> 01:12.989
That's a reality.

01:13.657 --> 01:17.118
In a war where mankind's very
survival hangs in the balance,

01:17.828 --> 01:20.538
it's up to each of us
to make a difference.

01:21.331 --> 01:24.333
Being a pilot is the best
way I know how to do that.

01:24.835 --> 01:27.670
Your loving son,
William Adama.

01:35.179 --> 01:37.513
Hold still,
you toaster bastards.

01:38.640 --> 01:42.393
Watch out, hotshot,
got a bandit on your 6.

01:42.478 --> 01:44.854
That's fine,
just adds to the challenge.

01:54.031 --> 01:55.615
Come on, kid,
break off! Break off!

01:55.699 --> 01:57.408
No way! I got this!

02:05.209 --> 02:07.460
Come on. Come on.

02:07.753 --> 02:08.877
Yeah!

02:15.385 --> 02:17.386
Frak. I can't see.

02:17.721 --> 02:20.556
You got no visibility, kid.
Get out of there.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.562
Watch your back, kid,
he's coming around again.

02:34.905 --> 02:37.156
There we go. Much better.

02:37.241 --> 02:39.492
What, are you crazy, Ensign?
Return to base.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.619
You can't take that kind
of radiation exposure.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.329
You'll die in
less than 30 seconds.

02:51.046 --> 02:52.421
Twenty seconds
and counting.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.091
You're approaching
radiation exposure max.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.013
Frak, my gun's jammed.

03:01.765 --> 03:03.599
You only have
12 seconds left.

03:03.684 --> 03:04.684
Frak that.

03:08.814 --> 03:11.274
Okay. Game over.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.900
Are you crazy?
You can't fire your...

03:22.786 --> 03:24.120
Yeah!

03:24.705 --> 03:26.455
Deal with it, sucker!

03:27.958 --> 03:29.333
Come on. Tell me
that ain't a record.

03:29.418 --> 03:32.920
Congratulations, Ensign.
You have completed Level 6.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.884
- Good sim score?
- No, no.

03:38.010 --> 03:40.720
Not a good sim score.
The top sim score.

03:41.263 --> 03:42.805
Mmm.
I'm impressed.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.807
Thanks. I'd be,
if I were you.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.810
Look out, Jenna,
we've got a live one.

03:47.978 --> 03:51.230
Let me guess, you're
fresh out of the Academy,

03:51.315 --> 03:53.316
you've been itching to fly Vipers
since you were in short pants,

03:53.400 --> 03:55.526
but your only worry now
is that the war will be over

03:55.611 --> 03:58.529
before you get a chance to prove
what a bona fide ace you are.

03:58.614 --> 04:02.491
Congratulations. You got me pegged,
except for the worrying part.

04:02.576 --> 04:03.659
I don't do that.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.037
Oh, look at
the pair on you.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.413
Was that a request?

04:07.997 --> 04:08.697
No.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.250
No. Don't get your hopes up, rook.
You're not my type.

04:11.335 --> 04:13.669
No? Good.
So it's a date.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.546
- Easy. Down, boy.
- Oh, man.

04:15.756 --> 04:16.923
You're a real charger,
aren't you, rook?

04:17.007 --> 04:18.007
Thank you.

04:18.884 --> 04:20.843
You looking
for some action?

04:21.720 --> 04:23.721
There's the girl that's gonna give it to you.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.567
Godsdamn!

05:49.307 --> 05:50.307
Yo, rook, you're
blocking traffic.

05:50.392 --> 05:51.392
Sorry.

05:56.273 --> 05:57.523
That's Deke Tornvald.

05:57.858 --> 05:58.899
"The Minute Man."

05:59.151 --> 06:00.276
Heard of him, huh?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.528
Heard of him?
He was, like, my hero at the Academy.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.071
What's he got now,
like 30 kills?

06:04.156 --> 06:06.615
Better hurry or there won't
be any left for you, ace.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.117
McGavin.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.495
Back just in time.
Suit up. Briefing in 30.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.122
- Another snowball patrol, sir?
- Yeah.

06:13.665 --> 06:14.832
What's this? Fresh meat?

06:14.958 --> 06:17.168
Ensign William Adama,
reporting for flight duty, sir.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.502
If there's a mission,
I'd like to be part of it.

06:18.587 --> 06:19.837
Good. Papers.

06:21.173 --> 06:22.256
At ease.

06:24.134 --> 06:25.468
You're FOB, Ensign.

06:25.594 --> 06:27.053
Sure you don't want to
find your rack first?

06:27.137 --> 06:29.722
Respectfully, sir, I signed on
to kill toasters, not take naps.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.391
Just point me at my plane
and I'll get started.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.393
All right, Ensign,

06:34.478 --> 06:36.479
I'm assigning you to the Weasel.
She's right over there.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.400
She's beautiful, sir.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.319
Not the Viper, rook.
The bird behind her.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.786
That old flying
pillbox, sir?

06:51.870 --> 06:53.788
It's a Raptor. That's the designation
and you're qualified.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.414
- No, sir, there has to be some kind...
- Respectfully.

06:55.499 --> 06:57.750
Respectfully, sir,
there is a mistake.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.586
I did not rate top of my
class so I could drive a bus.

07:00.879 --> 07:01.879
I'm a Viper pilot.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.130
Congratulations.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.465
I'll break it down
for you like this.

07:04.549 --> 07:07.384
The brass makes it seem like Operation
Clean Sweep lived up to its name,

07:07.469 --> 07:09.720
but somebody forgot to
give the toasters that memo.

07:09.805 --> 07:11.931
They're taking down our
planes right and left.

07:12.224 --> 07:15.684
And right now I need Raptor drivers
more than I need Viper jocks.

07:15.894 --> 07:18.687
So make sure your bus
is ready for action.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.898
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.108
Good.

07:22.359 --> 07:23.692
Dismissed.

07:31.368 --> 07:32.493
Oh.

07:38.708 --> 07:39.708
Oh!

07:42.254 --> 07:43.350
- I am so sorry.
- Frak!

07:43.351 --> 07:44.046
I'm sorry.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.507
I just finished mucking
this whole thing out!

07:46.591 --> 07:48.467
I'm sorry. I didn't
see what was going on. I'm sorry.

07:48.552 --> 07:50.469
Yeah, of course you didn't
because you weren't looking!

07:52.389 --> 07:53.681
What are you
doing in here?

07:53.974 --> 07:55.641
Are you with
the godsdamn press tour?

07:56.059 --> 07:57.393
No.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.478
I'm William Adama.
I was just assigned to fly this bird

07:59.563 --> 08:00.521
so I came
to get acquainted.

08:00.605 --> 08:01.939
You?

08:02.065 --> 08:03.899
- You're my new driver?
- Yeah.

08:04.067 --> 08:06.902
They sent me a rook
fresh off the boat? Great.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.489
Guess you must be
my new co-pilot.

08:10.574 --> 08:12.408
Not if I can do something
about it, I'm not.

08:12.576 --> 08:15.953
I want new gyros on there this
time or I will be pissed off.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.163
I'm working
on it, Lieutenant.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.373
Here, let me help
you with all this.

08:22.586 --> 08:24.086
Just leave it.
Just leave it.

08:24.796 --> 08:25.963
I said leave it alone.

08:26.256 --> 08:27.756
Fasjovik?

08:27.924 --> 08:30.259
Frak. You gotta call me
something, call me Coker.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.844
Just don't get too
familiar with it.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.011
Okay.

08:33.638 --> 08:36.974
So, Coker,
who was your last pilot?

08:39.269 --> 08:40.394
Just mopping up
what's left of him.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.609
Frakking knuckle-draggers.

08:48.278 --> 08:51.822
Poor bastard.
Who the frak signs up for a third tour?

08:55.452 --> 08:57.119
Hey, look, I'm sorry
about your friend.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.371
He wasn't my frakking friend!
He was an asshole.

08:59.456 --> 09:02.166
And he was worth
10 huskers like you!

09:02.250 --> 09:05.836
Lieutenant Fasjovik and Ensign
Adama, please report to the CO.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.005
Briefing call.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.216
Here we go again.

09:10.300 --> 09:13.427
Just listen real good and try
not to get us killed, okay, rook?

09:13.803 --> 09:16.805
And you better clean up.
This ain't one of your barnyard tractor pulls.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.058
Um,
I'm from Caprica City.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.435
Yeah, tell that to someone who cares, Husker.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.369
You gonna offer
the Commander a drink?

09:39.120 --> 09:40.788
- What?
- Flask.

09:41.331 --> 09:42.539
Frak.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.416
Let's go.

09:53.510 --> 09:54.510
Sir.

09:54.594 --> 09:55.719
Mr. Fasjovik.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.682
Forty-seven days left
in your mandatory second tour.

09:59.766 --> 10:00.766
Planning on re-upping?

10:00.850 --> 10:02.268
Not if I get
a say in it, sir.

10:02.352 --> 10:05.312
Hard to part with an experienced
officer, but that's your call.

10:05.397 --> 10:07.022
- Clean up that image.
- Yes, sir.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.524
Ensign William Adama.

10:08.608 --> 10:12.194
Caprican, but with some very
interesting Tauron family connections.

10:12.696 --> 10:13.988
The Ha'la'tha?

10:14.864 --> 10:17.491
Can't see that my family has
anything to do with this mission, sir.

10:17.826 --> 10:20.160
Relax, son. I'd never judge a man
on his father's sins.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.121
Or merits.

10:22.664 --> 10:25.749
Your grades at the Academy
weren't exactly stellar,

10:25.917 --> 10:29.586
but your flight instructor says
you were a "natural." I quote,

10:29.754 --> 10:33.048
"One of the best pilot
candidates I have ever seen.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.301
"And unfortunately,
he knows it."

10:36.219 --> 10:38.304
You're a cocky son of a
bitch, aren't you, Ensign?

10:39.681 --> 10:40.973
Yes, you are.

10:41.057 --> 10:44.059
So is this an accurate assessment, son?
Are you a natural?

10:45.228 --> 10:46.770
I can fly a plane, sir.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.063
A "natural,"
I can't say.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.940
- Is that mine, Mr. Sig?
- Yes, sir.

10:50.025 --> 10:51.025
Thank you.

10:51.109 --> 10:53.360
We are 10 years
into a bad war, son,

10:53.445 --> 10:56.572
so now this is how I handle
cocky sons of bitches on my ship.

10:59.284 --> 11:01.910
I assign them to milk runs
until they cool down.

11:02.412 --> 11:03.346
Your orders.

11:04.581 --> 11:05.622
Something funny,
Mr. Fasjovik?

11:05.707 --> 11:06.915
Not at all, sir.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.793
You boys are going to take some
cargo to the Scorpion shipyards.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.420
You are going to
return with spare parts.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.088
Four-day round trip.

11:13.757 --> 11:16.342
I'd assign a jump-capable
ship if I could afford one,

11:16.426 --> 11:18.802
but I cannot, so your sorry-ass
Raptor will have to do.

11:19.429 --> 11:22.389
Above all, you are to
avoid any enemy contact.

11:22.807 --> 11:25.642
That includes Cylon ships,
SAMs, slingshots,

11:25.727 --> 11:28.020
and anything else they might happen
to have floating around out there.

11:28.104 --> 11:30.105
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

11:30.607 --> 11:33.150
Gentlemen,
do not frak this up.

11:34.569 --> 11:36.320
Come on. "Milk run"?

11:36.613 --> 11:37.821
I said I didn't
want to drive a bus,

11:37.906 --> 11:39.448
now he's got me driving
a frakking delivery truck.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.409
Hell, yeah. Only thing better
is if he'd make it

11:42.869 --> 11:46.663
a regular trip, say for the
next, I don't know, month or so.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.125
- You're really getting out?
- Like a shot, kid.

11:50.919 --> 11:53.295
And go back to what? Where?

11:53.671 --> 11:56.673
Who cares? As long as it's
far away from here.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.685
Excuse me, Captain?

12:10.230 --> 12:12.189
Captain Tornvald? Sir?

12:13.316 --> 12:15.442
Sir, I just wanted to say

12:15.527 --> 12:16.527
I've been
following your record

12:16.611 --> 12:18.320
since you first
joined the Squadron.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.824
Someday I hope to be
haIf the pilot you are.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.076
I'll let you in on
a little secret, kid.

12:28.206 --> 12:30.916
It's bullshit. All of it.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.093
It was awesome.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.095
And then I think he's gonna
bust us down and he says,

12:43.179 --> 12:45.806
"You know what I do? I'm gonna
send you on a godsdamn milk run."

12:46.182 --> 12:47.391
That's it.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.852
We're going out. It's gonna be two
days out, two days back.

12:50.728 --> 12:51.812
So what,
you gonna lay over?

12:51.938 --> 12:52.938
Hell, yeah,
I'm gonna lay over.

12:53.022 --> 12:53.981
They got real
booze over there.

12:54.065 --> 12:56.108
Not like this
watered-down pruno.

12:56.192 --> 12:59.111
So it sounds like you two booked
a bona fide pleasure cruise.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.612
Yeah, but tell that
to the young, dumb

13:00.697 --> 13:02.823
and itching to get his
ass shot off over there.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.341
He's still
crying his eyes out.

13:06.077 --> 13:07.703
What do you expect,
Coker?

13:07.871 --> 13:10.789
Our young thane just wants
to make a name for himself.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.499
Isn't that
why we're here?

13:12.709 --> 13:14.376
Huh? Kill the enemy?

13:15.628 --> 13:18.672
Destroy the frakking machines
before they destroy us.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.340
Hoorah.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.136
Kid, we all know
why we're here.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.472
Just don't be in
such a rush, okay?

13:34.898 --> 13:36.064
I think that's my towel.

13:44.574 --> 13:46.575
See anything
you like, rook?

13:51.539 --> 13:52.998
Hydraulic reservoir?

13:53.249 --> 13:54.708
Full. Cap secure.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.293
Front dradis antenna?

13:57.504 --> 13:58.629
Almost.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.257
So, Ha'la'tha.

14:03.551 --> 14:04.801
My dad's a lawyer.

14:04.886 --> 14:05.969
Yeah?

14:06.429 --> 14:08.305
- Mob lawyer?
- Defense attorney.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.515
Uh-huh.

14:09.599 --> 14:11.099
What's it to you?

14:12.185 --> 14:14.019
Just saying, seems to me
you could've wrangled

14:14.103 --> 14:15.854
a pass on this whole
fracas pretty easy.

14:15.939 --> 14:18.899
Is that what you would've done?
Found a way out of the war?

14:18.983 --> 14:21.068
All I'm saying, Husker,
is nobody gave me a choice.

14:23.446 --> 14:24.738
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:24.906 --> 14:25.989
What the hell is this?

14:26.074 --> 14:27.908
Your ordnance package,
what's it look like?

14:27.992 --> 14:29.910
Well, it looks
a little light to me.

14:29.994 --> 14:32.871
I see a full set of com drones,
missile decoys, and what, two Archers?

14:32.956 --> 14:34.164
Yeah, we're short
on air-to-airs.

14:34.249 --> 14:36.041
Ordnance chief says two,
so two's what you get.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.125
You got a problem,
take it up with him.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.210
Yeah, I'll
take it up with him.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.836
I'm more concerned
with our cargo.

14:39.921 --> 14:41.463
Can we at least
get an exact weight?

14:42.131 --> 14:43.799
Why don't you
ask it yourself?

14:44.300 --> 14:47.052
Tiu,
she's our cargo?

14:49.472 --> 14:50.889
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.599
- We already met, right? In the...
- Oh, yeah.

14:52.684 --> 14:53.976
- In the shower.
- In the shower.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.060
You're a pilot?

14:55.144 --> 14:57.271
Uh, civilian.
I'm a software engineer.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.606
I'm Bill Adama,
your pilot.

14:59.691 --> 15:00.816
It's nice to meet you.

15:03.695 --> 15:06.071
Welcome aboard, anyway.
Like I said, I'm Bill Adama, your pilot.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.948
This is my co-pilot
and ECO,

15:08.032 --> 15:08.792
Lieutenant...

15:10.076 --> 15:11.201
Coker. Coker's fine.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.997
You look kind of young for a pilot.
Are you any good?

15:15.707 --> 15:16.790
So they tell me.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.458
You believe
everything they tell you?

15:20.003 --> 15:21.420
Why don't we get going?

15:21.546 --> 15:23.589
Assuming this piece of
shit can actually fly.

15:29.679 --> 15:32.806
Raptor Niner-zero-niner,
you are cleared for departure.

15:48.156 --> 15:51.575
Good afternoon, this is
your Captain, Bill Adama.

15:51.701 --> 15:54.119
Our flight time to Scorpion
is approximately two days,

15:54.203 --> 15:57.372
during which we hope to
encounter absolutely nothing.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.792
Fortunately, you'll find a wide
range of fine holoband entertainments

16:00.877 --> 16:02.169
to help you pass the time.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.963
For now, please remain seated with
your seatbelt securely fastened

16:05.048 --> 16:09.259
and thank you once again for
flying Wild Weasel Airlines.

16:09.886 --> 16:11.303
- Like that, huh?
- Lovely.

16:12.555 --> 16:15.057
You're wasting your charms,
such as they are.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.893
- I know her type.
- Yeah? What type is that?

16:18.603 --> 16:22.189
As far as she's concerned,
we're just the hired help. Oh, hello.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.941
Are we still in dradis
range of Galactica?

16:25.026 --> 16:26.276
- No.
- No.

16:26.361 --> 16:29.529
Good. If you'll open this,
you'll find a new set of orders.

16:30.573 --> 16:31.740
Give me that.

16:33.868 --> 16:36.161
- What the hell is this?
- Open it and you'll find out.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.503
These are from
the Admiralty.

16:44.587 --> 16:48.256
As you can see, it specifies
a new set of coordinates

16:48.716 --> 16:50.842
for a rendezvous with the
heavy cruiser Archeron.

16:51.094 --> 16:54.012
No, no, no, no, no. That is two days in
the wrong direction, lady.

16:54.097 --> 16:56.473
That is Sector 12. That is right on the edge
of Cylon-controlled space.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.350
No, there's no way we're going
to make it out of there alive.

16:58.434 --> 16:59.893
No, no, no. There's no frakking
way this is right.

16:59.977 --> 17:01.478
- I'm calling Galactica.
- No, you're not.

17:01.604 --> 17:04.231
- Excuse me?
- The orders specify wireless silence.

17:04.773 --> 17:06.566
That means no contact
with Galactica

17:06.651 --> 17:08.777
or any other
Colonial ship or outpost.

17:08.903 --> 17:11.530
It also states that you are
both to follow my orders.

17:12.115 --> 17:13.406
So let's get started.

17:14.117 --> 17:15.617
We have a lot of
space to cover.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.500
What are you grinning at?

17:23.584 --> 17:24.626
Milk run?

17:24.711 --> 17:26.420
Milk run, my ass.

17:53.489 --> 17:54.531
Damn it.

17:59.787 --> 18:01.830
Having trouble
with your band?

18:02.749 --> 18:03.749
Yeah.

18:03.833 --> 18:04.958
Let me have a look.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.005
You know how to...

18:11.007 --> 18:12.007
You know how
to fix them?

18:12.550 --> 18:14.509
I used to work for the
company that designed them.

18:17.221 --> 18:18.847
You worked for
Graystone Industries?

18:20.683 --> 18:22.142
I worked on Cylons.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.398
I designed the upgrade
on their MCP chip.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.443
- That's their brain.
- Their brain, I know.

18:34.405 --> 18:37.199
So in other words, you helped improve
the machines that are killing us.

18:43.414 --> 18:44.539
Hey.

18:45.583 --> 18:46.792
Better get up here.

18:47.502 --> 18:49.920
We're approaching
the rendezvous coordinates.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.047
Husker?

18:58.721 --> 19:00.347
- Dradis?
- Clear.

19:02.683 --> 19:03.892
Here we go.

19:05.061 --> 19:07.646
Colonial transponder.
Good.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.357
Hold on.

19:10.441 --> 19:11.942
I'm reading
multiple signatures.

19:12.235 --> 19:13.735
Maybe Archeron
has support ships.

19:14.362 --> 19:16.488
Then where the hell
are their transponders?

19:17.073 --> 19:18.031
Something's wrong
with this picture.

19:18.115 --> 19:20.075
Break radio silence
and hail them.

19:22.245 --> 19:26.498
Archeron, this is Raptor Niner-zero-niner.
Acknowledge and respond.

19:33.381 --> 19:34.339
Try again.

19:34.423 --> 19:37.175
Archeron, this is
Raptor Niner-zero-niner.

19:37.260 --> 19:38.718
Acknowledge and respond.

20:19.010 --> 20:20.385
Gods!

20:20.678 --> 20:22.137
Is that Archeron?

20:29.478 --> 20:30.896
Got your answer?

20:31.898 --> 20:35.025
Okay, get back there and sit down.
Strap yourseIf in. Now.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.292
This is unbelievable.

20:54.629 --> 20:56.212
Must've
been an ambush.

21:00.176 --> 21:01.676
Nobody could've
survived this.

21:05.848 --> 21:08.391
I've got three enemy contacts.
Incoming!

21:11.646 --> 21:12.646
Whoa!

21:18.069 --> 21:20.654
I got one Raider inbound
on our starboard side.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.781
Visual.
Where are the other two?

21:22.865 --> 21:24.449
I don't know. Targeting.

21:25.660 --> 21:27.953
Damn it! Auto-targeting
is not responding. I can't get a lock!

21:28.037 --> 21:29.579
Can you get the helmets,
please?

21:31.958 --> 21:32.646
Switch to manual.

21:32.647 --> 21:33.691
- Switch it to manual.
- You don't understand.

21:33.692 --> 21:35.335
We're not to engage the enemy!

21:35.419 --> 21:37.045
The godsdamn enemy
engaged us, lady,

21:37.129 --> 21:38.630
and we can't outrun
them in this bird.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.090
Thank you.

21:44.095 --> 21:45.387
Come on.

22:07.952 --> 22:10.620
Visual. We've got our second bandit
incoming. Straight ahead.

22:10.705 --> 22:12.706
We're locked on. Firing.

22:17.586 --> 22:18.837
Where's that third Raider?

22:19.213 --> 22:20.547
Visual, 3 o'clock.

22:21.590 --> 22:23.091
Fire.

22:26.262 --> 22:27.846
- What's going on?
- Of all the frakked up...

22:27.930 --> 22:29.764
- What happened?
- It's all good. We're all right.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.020
Two bandits,
no missiles.

22:35.104 --> 22:36.771
Now I really
don't like the math.

22:42.695 --> 22:43.987
Where the frak
are you going?

22:44.071 --> 22:45.739
We can't
stay out in open space.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.124
I thought
we couldn't outrun them.

22:56.292 --> 22:58.209
We can't. Maybe this will
slow them down.

23:21.275 --> 23:22.776
The frakking thing's jammed!

23:22.860 --> 23:23.943
Let's go to plan B.

23:24.028 --> 23:25.528
There's a plan B?

23:25.613 --> 23:27.405
The fuselage is
still largely intact,

23:27.490 --> 23:29.574
so there's a good chance
the jump drive will be, too.

23:29.658 --> 23:31.242
What the hell are
you talking about?

23:31.327 --> 23:33.828
We're gonna thread the needle.
Let's see if the toaster can follow.

23:42.129 --> 23:43.379
One, two, three.

23:43.464 --> 23:44.589
Husker.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.007
- One...
- Are you counting?

23:48.969 --> 23:50.220
No, Husker.

23:57.186 --> 23:58.436
One, two...

23:58.521 --> 23:59.646
No, no, no,
don't try it!

24:03.275 --> 24:06.569
No, Husker, no!
You're not gonna make it.

24:19.917 --> 24:21.835
This is what we do!

24:24.046 --> 24:25.255
Yeah!

24:36.350 --> 24:37.851
Not bad, Husker.

24:39.436 --> 24:40.478
Stupid,

24:41.272 --> 24:42.397
but not bad.

24:47.403 --> 24:48.903
Let's get our asses home.

24:49.405 --> 24:50.572
No arguments there.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.949
- You okay?
- I'm all right.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.450
Good.

24:54.535 --> 24:57.120
Don't worry. We'll get you back to
Galactica safe and sound. All right?

24:57.580 --> 24:58.830
We can't go back.

24:59.915 --> 25:01.457
Not yet, anyway.

25:03.711 --> 25:05.086
I'm sorry. What?

25:05.713 --> 25:08.882
I need you to send a simple
hail on that frequency.

25:13.095 --> 25:16.306
Lady, our orders were to get
you here and that job is done.

25:16.390 --> 25:20.059
Your orders are to do as I say
so long as I'm aboard this ship.

25:20.311 --> 25:21.436
They are.

25:21.937 --> 25:23.146
All right? They are.

25:24.273 --> 25:25.481
Send the message.

25:26.859 --> 25:27.901
Sure.

25:29.278 --> 25:30.486
Let's just let
every toaster ship

25:30.571 --> 25:32.197
in the sector know
exactly where we are.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.115
Clever. I like it.

25:44.418 --> 25:45.585
What the frak?

25:46.503 --> 25:48.171
We got a response already?

25:48.339 --> 25:50.924
It's like someone was camped
out on the frequency, waiting.

25:51.008 --> 25:52.300
Someone was.

25:53.344 --> 25:54.719
What's the message?

25:57.473 --> 26:01.351
They're coordinates.
And these are in Cylon space.

26:01.435 --> 26:02.393
Then that's where
we're going.

26:02.478 --> 26:03.728
No, it's not
where we're going.

26:03.812 --> 26:05.396
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not where we're going.

26:05.481 --> 26:06.481
Yes, it is.

26:06.565 --> 26:07.523
I'm going home.

26:07.650 --> 26:09.525
- No. Coker...
- If you guys want to come with me,

26:09.652 --> 26:11.236
- that's great. I'll take you.
- Listen to me, all right?

26:11.362 --> 26:13.780
- I'll give you a ride. There's even some food...
- Coker, listen to me!

26:13.906 --> 26:15.698
- What?
- You've got two months left on your tour.

26:15.783 --> 26:17.200
All right?
You're coming with us.

26:17.284 --> 26:19.244
You want to spend the rest
of your life in prison, huh?

26:19.328 --> 26:20.954
'Cause you're gonna get
a court martial like that.

26:21.038 --> 26:23.581
Do you really think you can
talk to me in my godsdamn ship?

26:23.666 --> 26:25.625
Coker, I am the pilot
of this ship!

26:25.709 --> 26:27.377
You are a co-pilot.

26:34.093 --> 26:35.718
Let me know
when we're close.

26:40.557 --> 26:42.976
I'm beginning to like her
about as much as I like you.

26:43.060 --> 26:44.352
Good.

26:52.361 --> 26:53.403
That it?

26:53.946 --> 26:56.197
Coordinates are on the
far side of that big rock.

26:56.490 --> 26:57.865
Still nothing on dradis?

26:58.325 --> 26:59.367
No.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.370
But with all this radiation,
dradis ain't worth a damn.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.497
You could hide a fleet of
Basestars in this system.

27:04.999 --> 27:06.708
Better go wake up
her holiness.

27:14.883 --> 27:20.263
Dr. Kelly?

27:24.351 --> 27:25.685
Becca? Wake up.

27:26.729 --> 27:30.023
Ezra?

27:34.403 --> 27:35.570
It's you.

27:44.955 --> 27:46.581
You were talking
in your sleep.

27:47.124 --> 27:49.000
- What did I say?
- Nothing.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.586
You called me Ezra.

28:01.221 --> 28:03.556
Look, you don't have to explain
who he is if you don't want.

28:03.640 --> 28:04.932
You've heard of Ezra Barzel?

28:05.017 --> 28:06.100
Of course I have.

28:07.144 --> 28:10.897
Old Marine, took out like an
entire Cylon platoon single-handed.

28:11.440 --> 28:14.108
A lot of the guys joined up
at the Academy because of him.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.777
- It's an inspiring story.
- Hmm.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.696
He was an inspiring man.

28:20.949 --> 28:22.033
And a good husband.

28:30.334 --> 28:32.293
I hope you had
a nice snooze.

28:33.212 --> 28:36.422
We're about to find out what kind of
fun and games you got us into this time.

28:41.953 --> 28:43.721
Approaching coordinates.

28:45.015 --> 28:47.225
Dradis contact.
Multiple readings.

28:48.560 --> 28:49.811
It is a fleet.

28:55.776 --> 28:57.985
Colonial transponder.
It's one of ours.

28:58.445 --> 28:59.654
There you go.

29:00.864 --> 29:02.198
All right.

29:02.825 --> 29:05.243
And it looks like they're
sending up a greeting party.

29:05.327 --> 29:06.702
Hello, people.

29:17.506 --> 29:19.006
They're coming in hot.

29:21.051 --> 29:22.343
Weapons locked on.

29:22.428 --> 29:26.514
Unidentified Raptor, answer
password challenge "Spigot."

29:27.182 --> 29:29.225
- What the frak?
- I don't know.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.853
This is Raptor
Niner-zero-niner,

29:31.937 --> 29:33.396
attached to
the Battlestar Galactica.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.356
We do not know
of any password.

29:38.360 --> 29:39.986
We're here on
a special mission.

29:40.070 --> 29:42.029
Repeat,
challenge is "Spigot."

29:42.114 --> 29:45.199
You have five seconds to
respond or we'll open fire.

29:45.742 --> 29:46.993
- Five seconds to respond?
- Five, four...

29:47.119 --> 29:49.078
- Did Nash tell you any passwords?
- No. Did you get any passwords?

29:49.204 --> 29:50.955
- No, I didn't get any passwords.
- You didn't read the order?

29:51.039 --> 29:52.540
- Did you read the orders?
- I skimmed it.

29:52.666 --> 29:54.584
I don't know.
But, Coker, we need that password.

29:54.668 --> 29:55.751
Well, try and think of
something, all right?

29:55.836 --> 29:56.836
They're engaging us.

29:56.920 --> 29:57.962
They're gonna
open fire any minute.

29:58.046 --> 29:59.130
We're from Galactica.

29:59.214 --> 30:01.340
- We don't have a...
- Arrow. Response is arrow.

30:05.679 --> 30:09.140
Affirmative. Niner-zero-niner,
follow me to the outer marker

30:09.224 --> 30:13.060
then contact LSO on frequency
134 for landing instructions.

30:13.562 --> 30:14.645
Roger that.

30:14.730 --> 30:16.230
You might've told us
that bit of business

30:16.315 --> 30:18.524
before we almost got
our asses shot off.

30:18.609 --> 30:21.486
Everything I tell you has to
be on a need-to-know basis.

30:21.570 --> 30:22.987
- That's the order.
- Frak.

30:31.997 --> 30:34.540
See that Battlestar?
Wait, is that Valkyrie?

30:35.667 --> 30:37.168
- No.
- It is.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.837
- It is, it's Valkyrie.
- That's not possible.

30:39.922 --> 30:41.631
Valkyrie was destroyed
on Canceron Prime.

30:41.715 --> 30:44.926
No, it was reported destroyed.
See that heavy cruiser over there?

30:45.594 --> 30:46.886
That's the Loki.

30:47.888 --> 30:51.182
She was reported lost.
Presumed destroyed, too.

30:53.936 --> 30:56.896
It's a fleet of ghost ships
hiding out in Cylon space.

31:12.454 --> 31:14.247
Get out!
Get out! Get out!

31:14.456 --> 31:15.873
- Get out!
- I'm fine.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.167
Move out!
People, move!

31:18.252 --> 31:19.293
Come on.

31:20.546 --> 31:22.046
- Your hands up!
- On your knees.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.422
Easy. Easy, easy.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.884
I just want to speak to
the commander of this ship.

31:26.969 --> 31:28.386
Shut up.

31:28.470 --> 31:30.137
You tell me who you are
and how you found this fleet.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.139
Take these to your
commanding officer.

31:32.224 --> 31:33.975
They'll confirm
my identity and mission.

31:36.770 --> 31:39.480
They're not exactly going all out
to make us feel welcome, are they?

31:39.898 --> 31:41.983
Reminds me of Colonial Day
at my mother-in-law's.

31:42.067 --> 31:43.192
Shut up.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.153
You're married?

31:47.990 --> 31:49.657
Do you see a ring
on my finger?

31:50.158 --> 31:52.201
Stand her up.
Hold still.

31:59.293 --> 32:01.002
Commander will see you
in her quarters.

32:01.461 --> 32:02.587
Pick it up.

32:02.838 --> 32:04.005
All right,
all right, all right.

32:12.306 --> 32:13.514
Get the Admiral
on the horn.

32:13.599 --> 32:16.267
Tell him I'm coming aboard to
brief him on a priority one mission.

32:16.351 --> 32:19.103
Fit Osiris out for a 12-league
jump, and tell him I'm gonna need 10

32:19.187 --> 32:20.396
of his new Mark Threes
loaded for bear

32:20.480 --> 32:22.690
and prepped for
atmospheric insertion.

32:22.774 --> 32:25.276
Oh, and detail a Raptor
for Dr. Kelly here.

32:25.986 --> 32:27.069
Commander.

32:27.487 --> 32:28.696
Commander on deck.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.615
- Ensign William Adama.
- As you were.

32:30.699 --> 32:33.451
Squadron Victor-Alpha-42,
Galactica.

32:34.036 --> 32:35.328
We brought Dr. Kelly here

32:35.412 --> 32:37.788
and I would like to volunteer
our bird for this mission.

32:37.873 --> 32:39.165
How long you
been flying, junior?

32:39.374 --> 32:41.125
This is my first op, sir.

32:41.460 --> 32:44.712
But my ECO and I have already taken
out two Cylon SAMs and three Raiders.

32:45.213 --> 32:48.090
Three bandits?
In a Raptor? That true?

32:49.843 --> 32:51.218
It's true enough.

32:53.221 --> 32:54.555
Well, thanks, son,
but I think we'll go ahead

32:54.640 --> 32:57.224
and use one of our
own birds on this one.

32:57.809 --> 32:58.893
Commander.

33:00.145 --> 33:01.228
Excuse me.

33:01.938 --> 33:03.064
Commander.

33:03.565 --> 33:05.900
These men have gotten
me this far in one piece.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.110
I'd like to stick with
them if it's all right.

33:14.034 --> 33:15.493
Have it your way.

33:15.869 --> 33:17.078
Thank you, Commander.

33:21.458 --> 33:23.876
Make sure the other pilots
are volunteers, too.

33:25.587 --> 33:26.671
Um...

33:29.466 --> 33:32.635
Did you just hear that?
Volunteers.

33:34.096 --> 33:35.262
So?

33:35.764 --> 33:40.142
So, congratulations, Husker.
You just signed us up for a one-way trip.

33:52.948 --> 33:56.409
We're on course to Djerba, a former
winter resort moon in Sector 12.

33:56.493 --> 33:59.829
Cylons took it over early in
the war as a strategic outpost.

33:59.913 --> 34:01.247
Now, it's so deep
in their space

34:01.331 --> 34:03.040
that intel says
it's mostly unguarded.

34:03.125 --> 34:05.501
Some ground forces with support
ships visiting periodically,

34:05.585 --> 34:06.919
but no Basestars.

34:07.003 --> 34:09.630
A spec ops Marine recon team
has already been inserted.

34:09.715 --> 34:12.757
Our job is to deliver Dr.
Kelly safely to the operators,

34:12.842 --> 34:15.803
then bug out, let them take her the
rest of the way to her objective.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.389
I want all Vipers
prepped by 1400,

34:19.474 --> 34:21.434
tactical jump
to follow at 1500.

34:21.976 --> 34:23.811
Let's get to work,
gentlemen.

34:24.271 --> 34:25.312
Yes, sir.

34:37.743 --> 34:38.868
Holy frak.

34:39.494 --> 34:40.995
Is that my old
friend Jim Kirby,

34:45.833 --> 34:48.293
Coker.
It's good to see you.

34:49.212 --> 34:50.963
- You, too, buddy.
- So good.

34:53.507 --> 34:55.092
That was a heck
of a surprise, man.

34:55.177 --> 34:58.137
I read your name on a casualty
list when the Valkyrie, you know,

34:58.221 --> 34:59.555
supposedly bought it.

34:59.639 --> 35:01.766
Yeah, well, we almost did.
Ship was shot to hell.

35:01.850 --> 35:03.017
But then Command saw
that she could be salvaged,

35:03.101 --> 35:04.393
and they saw an opportunity.

35:04.478 --> 35:06.979
Right, you assemble
a fleet of dead ships

35:07.063 --> 35:08.689
- and hit them when they least expect it.
- That's good.

35:08.774 --> 35:09.857
Talk about
creepy, though.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.942
They made us witness
our own death certificates.

35:12.569 --> 35:13.778
Are you frakking
kidding me?

35:14.029 --> 35:15.696
"Give your all
for the war," right?

35:16.490 --> 35:17.823
Yeah, "Us or them."

35:20.285 --> 35:22.036
So, I'm guessing that

35:23.330 --> 35:26.165
you being dead and all, you haven't
had a chance to talk to Janey?

35:28.043 --> 35:29.126
No.

35:31.254 --> 35:32.338
I saw her.

35:33.381 --> 35:35.341
I had a couple of
days' leave over on Picon.

35:35.425 --> 35:37.301
So what are you gonna tell me now?
She's remarried?

35:38.553 --> 35:40.012
Not that I blame her.

35:40.555 --> 35:42.014
Just this frakking war.

35:42.098 --> 35:43.682
No, she's on
her own, man.

35:43.934 --> 35:45.059
Well, she's...

35:47.062 --> 35:48.229
She's got a kid.

35:49.064 --> 35:50.898
A kid? What are you
talking about?

35:51.733 --> 35:52.817
She's got a boy.

35:53.443 --> 35:55.986
He's got her hair, man.
He's got her nose.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.072
He's got your eyes.

36:01.576 --> 36:03.035
Wait, what are you saying?

36:03.829 --> 36:05.329
I got a son, is that what
you're telling me right now?

36:05.413 --> 36:06.705
- I got a son?
- Yeah, you do.

36:07.707 --> 36:09.875
Anslem. That's his name.

36:10.335 --> 36:11.710
That's my father's name.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.128
I know.

36:15.090 --> 36:16.090
Really, I got a son?

36:17.509 --> 36:18.926
You motherfrakker...

36:19.594 --> 36:20.761
- I got a son?
- Yeah.

36:20.846 --> 36:22.596
I got a frakking son!

36:23.098 --> 36:24.139
I got a son!

36:31.815 --> 36:34.108
This is the Commander.
Thirty minutes to combat jump.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.901
All pilots to their planes.
Action stations,

36:35.986 --> 36:37.695
set condition one
throughout the ship.

36:40.156 --> 36:41.282
Hey, thank you.

37:03.972 --> 37:05.055
Jump.

37:14.149 --> 37:15.316
Jump complete.

37:15.859 --> 37:17.359
No dradis contacts.

37:17.861 --> 37:20.821
Approaching launch
window in ten, nine,

37:21.281 --> 37:23.115
eight, seven...

37:27.871 --> 37:28.996
Dradis contact!

37:29.664 --> 37:35.544
Basestar bearing 275 carom
412, range 2,000. Inbound.

37:36.338 --> 37:37.880
Have they made us yet?

37:38.340 --> 37:39.465
No.

37:40.634 --> 37:43.260
They still haven't
scrambled their Raiders.

37:43.345 --> 37:45.721
But even in stealth mode, they're
gonna pick us up on dradis soon,

37:45.805 --> 37:47.681
and they'll definitely
see us if we try to launch.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.017
We can still abort.

37:55.815 --> 37:57.149
This is
the Commander.

38:00.904 --> 38:02.488
We've encountered a Basestar.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.700
We're going to engage.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.956
We'll be launching the Raptor
along with the Vipers.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.166
The objective of
the Viper fleet is to drag

38:14.250 --> 38:16.377
the fight away from
the ice planet Djerba.

38:17.295 --> 38:20.422
Kirby, Elias, you accompany the Raptor down.

38:20.715 --> 38:23.676
It is critical that Dr.
Kelly reach her objective.

38:24.177 --> 38:27.513
The fate of this war hinges
on the success of this mission.

38:31.226 --> 38:33.894
Activate all batteries
and arm the nukes.

38:45.824 --> 38:46.907
They've seen us.

38:50.245 --> 38:51.662
They're launching Raiders.

38:57.419 --> 38:58.460
Launch.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.462
Launch all planes.

39:01.047 --> 39:03.966
534, it's positive and steady.
Go for launch.

39:08.304 --> 39:12.141
Check thrust. Positive and steady.
You are a go for launch.

39:18.106 --> 39:21.400
Thrusters engage.
Dradis is green. I see them.

39:27.782 --> 39:28.949
Raptor's away.

39:29.659 --> 39:30.784
Open fire.

39:49.637 --> 39:52.222
We're down two planes.
We can't keep them bottled up any longer.

39:54.309 --> 39:55.642
Duster bought it.

39:56.019 --> 39:57.728
Those poor bastards are
outnumbered 10-to-one.

39:57.812 --> 39:58.812
They're never gonna make it.

40:03.485 --> 40:04.818
Fire the nukes.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.239
At this range we may
not clear the blast.

40:09.949 --> 40:11.033
Do it.

40:17.791 --> 40:18.832
No, no, no!

40:18.917 --> 40:20.584
We got atmosphere.

40:20.668 --> 40:22.252
I'm flying blind, here.

40:22.337 --> 40:24.004
I can't frakking
see anything.

40:25.173 --> 40:27.549
We got a contact!
Look out, guys.

40:27.675 --> 40:29.760
I got two...
No, three bandits.

40:29.844 --> 40:31.553
Two klicks and closing.

40:31.638 --> 40:34.515
Wait, wait, wait!
I see them, 7 o'clock high!

40:35.100 --> 40:37.267
Copy that, Kirby.
I'll follow your lead.

40:37.519 --> 40:40.938
Better take us down. Betting those
things can't handle the atmosphere.

40:43.817 --> 40:44.858
Roger that.

41:01.167 --> 41:02.543
Bay doors are jammed!

41:04.337 --> 41:06.130
Take us in.
We'll trigger them manually.

41:06.214 --> 41:07.381
Affirmative.

41:19.310 --> 41:22.229
These clouds are hiding a lot of crap.
This is not going to be easy.

41:22.397 --> 41:24.022
Oh, now
he gets humble.

41:24.107 --> 41:26.567
Just try and get us down
in one piece, Husker.

41:46.254 --> 41:47.629
Distance to target,
two klicks.

41:49.048 --> 41:50.549
Then take us in.

41:52.093 --> 41:53.844
I'll trigger them manually.

42:08.902 --> 42:10.652
Give me manual override
on the nukes.

42:18.745 --> 42:20.454
Squadron leader just got hit.

42:22.790 --> 42:24.249
I'm hit! I'm hit!

42:28.379 --> 42:29.504
You have it.

42:30.965 --> 42:32.341
Distance is 1,500.

42:33.092 --> 42:34.843
Brace for contact,
my friend.

43:02.956 --> 43:03.997
A nuke just went off.

43:04.666 --> 43:08.585
I've lost dradis contact
with Osiris and the Basestar.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.007
Keep a grip, kid.

43:22.684 --> 43:23.725
Bandits right up our asses.

43:23.810 --> 43:25.811
Weasel, we're gonna have to
roll out to get behind them.

43:26.312 --> 43:27.437
I can do better than that.

43:27.522 --> 43:30.774
Coker, get on that tail gun, and
try to hit something this time.

43:30.858 --> 43:32.943
You worry about the flying,
I'll worry about the shooting.

43:49.919 --> 43:52.004
I got one!
I frakking got one!

44:05.059 --> 44:06.143
I'm all right!

44:06.728 --> 44:09.354
Gods damn it, guys.
A little help here, please?

44:09.439 --> 44:11.648
We're getting
our asses kicked!

44:17.530 --> 44:18.655
Got him! Got him!

44:29.250 --> 44:30.792
He's on my 6.
I can't shake him!

44:30.877 --> 44:32.294
Wait, I see him!

44:36.591 --> 44:38.091
Elias is down!

44:38.426 --> 44:40.344
I'm hit! We're hit.

44:47.143 --> 44:48.935
I'm sorry, Coker.

44:50.104 --> 44:51.229
I'm going home.

44:51.564 --> 44:53.190
Say again, Kirby.
I didn't copy that.

44:54.025 --> 44:55.484
I'm going home.

44:58.905 --> 45:01.615
Kirby! Kirby,
what the frak?

45:10.917 --> 45:11.958
I'm out of ammo!

45:12.043 --> 45:13.085
Coke, where is he?

45:13.169 --> 45:14.836
Frak! 200 meters
and closing!

45:15.171 --> 45:16.296
Good.

45:37.944 --> 45:38.944
Yeah!

45:39.028 --> 45:41.113
Last one, Raider! Whoo!

45:45.910 --> 45:48.412
Hydraulics are shot.
I'm losing attitude control!

45:48.704 --> 45:50.122
We've lost
the left engine!

45:50.206 --> 45:52.249
Just find
a soft place to land!

46:48.723 --> 46:51.391
Com's shot and
the nav system's a mess.

46:51.893 --> 46:54.060
I think if I can get that
left engine back online,

46:54.145 --> 46:55.228
I can get her
off the ground.

46:55.313 --> 46:56.813
No way,
there's too much damage.

46:56.898 --> 46:59.274
The only way out of here is to
get Dr. Kelly to her rendezvous.

46:59.358 --> 47:00.650
Rendezvous? Are you nuts?

47:02.028 --> 47:04.196
Do you know how many people
just died on that ship?

47:04.280 --> 47:05.489
- I'm talking to you!
- Hey!

47:05.573 --> 47:07.157
Do you know
how many people?

47:07.241 --> 47:10.410
Typical crew complement of an
Orion-class ship is about 150,

47:10.703 --> 47:12.037
not counting the pilots.

47:12.205 --> 47:14.664
Hey, well, for fun,
let's count the pilots,

47:14.749 --> 47:16.333
'cause I'm pretty sure
they're frakking dead, too.

47:16.417 --> 47:18.168
- Look!
- Get your things. We're moving out.

47:18.252 --> 47:20.045
No, no, no, Husker,
we are not going anywhere

47:20.129 --> 47:21.505
unless I frakking say so.

47:21.589 --> 47:23.924
Husker? I am getting tired
of that frakking name.

47:24.050 --> 47:25.759
- Come on, guys.
- Well, you know what? The shoe fits.

47:25.843 --> 47:27.886
And I am really getting tired
of this frakked up attitude.

47:27.970 --> 47:30.805
You need to soldier up and stop
whining like a chicken shit short-timer.

47:30.973 --> 47:34.226
That's it? One week out of flight
school and you're calling me yellow?

47:38.564 --> 47:39.940
You want to go home?

47:40.691 --> 47:43.109
The fastest way to do that
is to find those Marines.

47:43.778 --> 47:45.862
I can pinpoint the location
of their transponder

47:45.947 --> 47:47.572
using my encrypted
tracking device.

47:47.949 --> 47:48.990
All right?

47:50.076 --> 47:52.786
They'll have their own extraction plan.
We can piggyback with them.

47:53.246 --> 47:54.996
I don't see
any alternative.

47:59.794 --> 48:01.461
This bird's kept me safe
for a bunch of years,

48:01.546 --> 48:04.005
and I frakking hate
leaving her like this.

48:06.968 --> 48:08.009
I know.

48:27.780 --> 48:29.364
It's coming
from over there.

48:42.837 --> 48:43.837
Hello?

48:45.464 --> 48:46.965
They should be here.

48:50.595 --> 48:51.928
We're still
getting signal?

48:53.097 --> 48:54.806
- Are we?
- Yes. Yes.

48:56.601 --> 48:58.602
Then the transponder's here.

49:06.110 --> 49:07.360
Oh, Gods!

49:18.539 --> 49:19.873
Oh, frak.

49:20.249 --> 49:22.834
What the hell happened to these guys?
These aren't gunshot wounds.

49:32.720 --> 49:33.762
Frak.

49:37.600 --> 49:38.767
All right.
All right.

49:39.101 --> 49:40.810
Transponder's
still broadcasting.

49:40.895 --> 49:42.479
I think we found
our recon team.

49:42.563 --> 49:45.065
That's it. We found them.
They're dead.

49:45.149 --> 49:48.068
This mission's a bust.
I'm heading back to the Raptor.

49:53.407 --> 49:54.574
- No.
- Frak.

49:58.371 --> 49:59.954
Well, this has
been a real treat,

50:00.039 --> 50:01.915
but I think it's time
we get out of here.

50:01.999 --> 50:03.500
Any takers? Let's go.

50:11.258 --> 50:12.258
Becca?

50:12.927 --> 50:14.010
Coker?

50:14.345 --> 50:15.387
We're here.

50:16.097 --> 50:17.305
Becca, where are you?

50:31.987 --> 50:33.780
- Becca!
- Help!

50:34.240 --> 50:35.281
Coker!

50:42.498 --> 50:43.873
We're down here.

50:57.638 --> 50:58.722
Bill.

50:59.223 --> 51:00.306
You okay?

51:00.683 --> 51:02.267
Oh, is he okay?

51:03.394 --> 51:04.436
Welcome to the party.

51:04.520 --> 51:07.230
If that was your attempt at a
rescue, you get an E for "effort"

51:07.314 --> 51:08.857
and an F for
"frakking it up."

51:08.941 --> 51:09.941
You don't appreciate shit.

51:10.025 --> 51:11.609
How're we gonna
get out of here?

51:18.159 --> 51:19.534
What the hell is this?

51:21.203 --> 51:23.329
There's got to be
another way out of here.

51:32.465 --> 51:35.508
What was that?
Did you hear that?

51:39.513 --> 51:41.097
What the hell are
all these holes?

51:43.309 --> 51:45.018
- There's something in the walls.
- What?

51:45.102 --> 51:46.102
What the frak was that?

51:46.187 --> 51:48.313
In the walls? What the frak are
you talking about?

51:52.193 --> 51:53.359
What was that?

51:56.447 --> 51:58.114
What the frak was that?

51:58.199 --> 51:59.532
Coker, are you bitten?

51:59.742 --> 52:02.327
Yes, I'm frakking bitten. Ow!

52:02.411 --> 52:04.204
- What is it?
- I don't know.

52:27.728 --> 52:30.063
Coker, hold it still!
I can't get a good shot!

52:30.815 --> 52:31.815
Get it off me!

52:31.899 --> 52:34.192
I can't get a clear shot.
Hold still!

52:35.277 --> 52:36.569
Get it off of me!

52:40.574 --> 52:42.075
Shoot the motherfrakker!

52:46.080 --> 52:47.163
Shoot it!

53:01.929 --> 53:03.179
You're late.

53:16.402 --> 53:17.777
Oh, Gods!

53:25.286 --> 53:26.828
Oh, man!

53:28.247 --> 53:29.956
Are we cool with
this thing in here?

53:30.291 --> 53:33.126
Don't worry, tough guy, it's
as dead as the ones down below.

53:33.252 --> 53:34.752
You must be
Captain Ramirez.

53:35.537 --> 53:37.088
Do I look like
a Ramirez?

53:37.548 --> 53:39.549
Captain's on ice with
the rest of the Marines.

53:39.633 --> 53:42.552
I'm all that's left.
Toth, Tech Sergeant, demolitions.

53:42.636 --> 53:44.470
I was starting to think you
weren't gonna make it, man.

53:44.555 --> 53:45.972
Yeah, we almost didn't.

53:46.473 --> 53:47.682
What the frak
are these things?

53:49.018 --> 53:53.563
Toasters have been using this
planet to test-drive cyborg critters.

53:53.647 --> 53:56.983
Half-machine, half-organic,
very hard to kill.

53:57.484 --> 53:58.985
Unless you have
the right weapon.

54:01.071 --> 54:04.324
Makes for good
eating, though.

54:09.663 --> 54:10.788
There it is.

54:13.751 --> 54:15.126
How long you
been here, man?

54:15.669 --> 54:17.045
You don't want to know.

54:18.631 --> 54:20.965
No. Thank you.
Maybe later.

54:22.092 --> 54:23.551
I'm all right for now.

54:27.681 --> 54:28.848
Mmm.

54:30.559 --> 54:31.684
I'm sorry

54:32.353 --> 54:35.188
I couldn't get here any
quicker after I saw your signal.

54:35.272 --> 54:37.106
Speaking of which,
who's got that bitch?

54:41.695 --> 54:44.864
Right now, we don't
need any more company.

54:45.532 --> 54:47.158
Is that how they
found your unit?

54:47.660 --> 54:49.118
Toasters didn't find them.

54:49.703 --> 54:51.120
We were breaking
camp in this cave.

54:51.205 --> 54:53.122
Captain sent me out to
reconnoiter the neighborhood,

54:53.207 --> 54:55.541
and when I got back, well...

54:57.711 --> 54:59.212
Little demons ambushed them.

55:00.381 --> 55:01.923
Frakking abominations.

55:03.634 --> 55:05.510
Whole war's
a frakking abomination.

55:05.594 --> 55:07.011
Ain't that right,
flyboy, huh?

55:07.388 --> 55:08.471
Ain't that right?

55:08.555 --> 55:10.098
Ain't that right, frakker?

55:10.182 --> 55:11.766
- Sergeant! Sergeant, please.
- Ain't that right?

55:11.850 --> 55:13.601
I assume that you've been
briefed on my mission.

55:13.686 --> 55:15.436
How long to get us
to my objective?

55:15.562 --> 55:18.022
Yeah, well,
storm's getting worse

55:18.107 --> 55:19.524
and you don't want to be
out there when it does.

55:19.608 --> 55:21.693
Plus, there's a toaster patrol
that I've been eyeballing

55:21.777 --> 55:23.194
and they see better
in this crap than we do.

55:23.278 --> 55:24.988
No, I'm sorry,
but I've got a timetable.

55:25.072 --> 55:26.948
I can't just sit around and
wait for this storm to pass.

55:27.032 --> 55:28.658
I think it's gonna
blow over by morning.

55:28.742 --> 55:31.577
Plus, I got a secure location
where we can hole up for the night.

55:31.662 --> 55:32.954
You want to
pack that to go?

55:33.038 --> 55:34.455
Yeah, no, we just ate.

55:34.540 --> 55:36.249
You know what?
I'm not frakking going with you.

55:36.333 --> 55:37.601
Because our
mission was to get...

55:38.585 --> 55:39.752
Hey!

55:40.546 --> 55:43.423
Apply pressure to the occipital
nerve and the carotid artery.

55:43.507 --> 55:46.050
Unconscious in eight seconds,
dead in 10.

55:46.135 --> 55:50.722
Five, six, seven, eight.

55:56.937 --> 55:58.604
Like I said,
let's get going.

56:04.111 --> 56:05.903
Come on, get up.

56:24.506 --> 56:27.300
That's your secure location?
A frakking ski lodge?

56:28.218 --> 56:32.513
Toasters used it as a storage
facility after the initial attack.

56:32.598 --> 56:34.307
Then they just abandoned it.

56:34.683 --> 56:36.100
What were they storing?

56:38.812 --> 56:40.271
Spare parts.

56:40.773 --> 56:43.399
Anyway, four stars
and all the comforts.

56:43.484 --> 56:46.402
Some of the suites even
have gas fireplaces, honey.

56:47.821 --> 56:49.072
Watch your step!

56:50.991 --> 56:53.326
Got my babies
planted all around here.

56:57.039 --> 56:58.998
Tripwires and mines.

57:01.960 --> 57:03.127
Follow me.

57:06.340 --> 57:08.800
Is it me or is this guy
wound a little tight?

57:10.177 --> 57:11.260
Come on.

57:22.314 --> 57:23.356
Nice, huh?

57:37.037 --> 57:39.455
I got a generator
set up for minimal power.

57:40.332 --> 57:43.417
Just don't turn on too many
lights, for obvious reasons.

57:43.502 --> 57:46.546
And if someone or something
comes knocking...

57:54.221 --> 57:55.388
Controlled bursts.

57:56.014 --> 57:57.348
We're low on ammo.

58:00.018 --> 58:02.728
Anybody want some rack time?
Now's your chance.

58:05.566 --> 58:06.941
I'll take first watch.

58:41.268 --> 58:42.393
You all right?

58:45.355 --> 58:46.439
Yeah.

58:54.031 --> 58:55.239
What was he like?

58:56.450 --> 58:58.492
- My husband?
- Yeah.

59:00.078 --> 59:02.205
A lot like you, actually.

59:03.081 --> 59:04.415
Idealistic.

59:05.459 --> 59:06.751
Ambitious.

59:07.252 --> 59:08.920
Was he a computer nerd,
like you?

59:11.131 --> 59:13.424
He was a professor,
thank you very much.

59:14.384 --> 59:16.052
An historian
who woke up one day

59:16.136 --> 59:19.472
and decided he couldn't just sit
back and watch history pass him by.

59:20.807 --> 59:24.060
He never wanted to be a hero, but
they turned him into one anyway.

59:24.645 --> 59:26.771
Slapped his face on
recruiting posters.

59:26.855 --> 59:28.689
All but resurrected
him in V-world.

59:28.774 --> 59:30.024
Yeah. I remember that.

59:32.277 --> 59:33.986
I'm just going to
sleep by the fire.

59:34.071 --> 59:37.323
Yeah, I'll make
a bed over there.

59:39.618 --> 59:42.119
What you don't remember,
because they never let it out,

59:42.663 --> 59:45.998
is that afterwards a reporter
found out it was all a fabrication.

59:47.751 --> 59:48.793
A lie.

59:51.088 --> 59:53.172
He didn't take out
a Cylon platoon.

59:53.840 --> 59:57.009
His scouting party was shot
up by men from his own unit.

59:58.262 --> 59:59.679
Friendly fire.

01:00:01.181 --> 01:00:03.808
But like you said,
it's a war, right?

01:00:08.522 --> 01:00:09.814
Shit happens.

01:00:11.692 --> 01:00:13.025
"Us or them."

01:00:14.152 --> 01:00:15.486
"All for the war."

01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:20.741
Everything they tell you to make
you give up what really matters.

01:00:21.576 --> 01:00:23.452
That's why
this war has to end.

01:00:34.548 --> 01:00:35.881
I understand.

01:00:38.343 --> 01:00:40.052
Believe me, I understand.

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:53.649
You're going to regret this.

01:01:07.414 --> 01:01:08.456
I'm...

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:11.751
I'm from Aerilon.

01:01:12.419 --> 01:01:13.711
Where are you from?

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:25.181
You got a family?

01:01:28.602 --> 01:01:30.561
Kid's green,
he's never gonna make it.

01:01:35.984 --> 01:01:37.610
Pretty damn good pilot.

01:01:38.653 --> 01:01:40.279
I had a pretty good unit.

01:01:40.655 --> 01:01:42.490
Fifty guys,
ultimate bad-asses.

01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:49.455
I'm the guy that's left.

01:01:56.588 --> 01:01:57.797
Where's your pal?

01:02:00.509 --> 01:02:01.717
I don't know.

01:02:05.472 --> 01:02:06.764
Don't you?

01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:43.134
I had enough of people.

01:02:45.804 --> 01:02:46.971
Get out.

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:52.893
Get the frak out.

01:03:54.623 --> 01:03:57.208
Back home, I couldn't
afford any of this stuff.

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:02.087
Figured it'd be a crime
to let it go to waste.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:04.924
May l?

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.761
Help yourself.

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:24.401
Show some respect.

01:04:25.779 --> 01:04:27.613
Do not frakking sip that.

01:04:36.122 --> 01:04:38.624
Yeah. It's nice.

01:04:45.632 --> 01:04:47.508
You had to frak her,
didn't you?

01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:55.641
Dumb, Husker.

01:04:56.935 --> 01:04:59.311
Dumb, dumb, dumb.

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:01.021
It wasn't like that.
It just happened.

01:05:02.482 --> 01:05:06.443
Oh, I guarantee you, whatever it
was like, it did not just happen.

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:12.074
Case in point, I'm guessing she
did not tell you why we're here.

01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:13.325
She did.

01:05:14.703 --> 01:05:15.869
Kind of. She's...

01:05:17.163 --> 01:05:19.081
She lost her husband.
He was some kind of a...

01:05:19.265 --> 01:05:21.500
Her husband.
Her frakking husband?

01:05:26.631 --> 01:05:28.215
Something just
hit the tripwires.

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:34.346
Let's go get
your girlfriend.

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:36.682
We don't need her getting
in the way of any bullets.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:06:06.879
Becca?

01:06:08.632 --> 01:06:09.757
What?

01:06:10.717 --> 01:06:12.259
I thought
she'd wait here.

01:06:12.344 --> 01:06:15.054
She probably just got spooked.
We'll find her.

01:06:15.555 --> 01:06:17.222
I'll take the north wing,
you go south.

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:19.850
Stay cool, Husker, all right?
Keep your head down.

01:06:38.912 --> 01:06:41.246
All right, you bastards.
Come to daddy.

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:09.191
Becca?

01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:55.000
She's okay.

01:10:56.044 --> 01:10:58.378
This one almost nailed
her before I got here.

01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:04.009
What's that noise
it's making?

01:11:04.802 --> 01:11:06.053
Screaming.

01:11:07.639 --> 01:11:09.014
Sorry, what? Screaming?

01:11:09.599 --> 01:11:10.641
They feel pain.

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:14.686
Put this thing out
of its misery, then.

01:11:31.245 --> 01:11:32.371
It's okay.

01:11:34.207 --> 01:11:35.540
That's all of them.

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:38.085
Toth.

01:11:39.045 --> 01:11:40.754
It's not going to
be okay for Toth.

01:12:04.988 --> 01:12:06.029
Toth?

01:12:06.114 --> 01:12:07.823
Tough motherfrakker
just took out two more.

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:09.533
He's not gonna make it.

01:12:12.829 --> 01:12:14.454
I got his wireless.

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:16.623
Why?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.458
Why do you think?

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:21.044
Fun and games are over.
I'm sending the evac code.

01:12:21.129 --> 01:12:22.504
- We're getting the frak out of here.
- No. No.

01:12:22.588 --> 01:12:24.172
- Crazy. Are you nuts?
- Nope.

01:12:24.757 --> 01:12:26.508
Look,
we complete this mission,

01:12:26.592 --> 01:12:28.260
then you can send whatever
code you want, all right?

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:30.345
Look, kid,
unless you haven't noticed,

01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:32.139
we're fresh out of
Marines and ammo.

01:12:32.223 --> 01:12:33.640
- I'm not trained for this.
- I noticed.

01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:37.019
So we're going to have
to make do, all right?

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:40.564
Where are we going?

01:12:40.648 --> 01:12:42.774
It's an automated
transmission array.

01:12:44.444 --> 01:12:46.111
You need to put
your gun down, Husker.

01:12:47.572 --> 01:12:48.613
Put it down.

01:12:49.824 --> 01:12:51.408
Coker, what are you doing?

01:12:52.118 --> 01:12:53.618
Look, you guys want to die heroes right now?

01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:55.454
I can do that
for you, right now.

01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:00.542
Test me, Husker.

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:08.633
Coker,
what are you doing?

01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:10.719
Why are you doing this?

01:13:10.803 --> 01:13:11.803
I can't take it.

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:15.057
Please, put the gun down.

01:13:15.141 --> 01:13:16.391
Come on.

01:13:17.268 --> 01:13:19.394
All right, it's gone.

01:13:20.938 --> 01:13:22.773
You tell me why
we're here, right now.

01:13:22.857 --> 01:13:24.816
- Don't do this.
- Tell me why we're here!

01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:31.114
This war isn't going nearly as
well as the government claims.

01:13:31.199 --> 01:13:32.324
I know.

01:13:32.492 --> 01:13:35.494
This surprise attack
is a last roll of the die.

01:13:36.162 --> 01:13:38.330
If it fails, we fail,
and it will fail

01:13:39.665 --> 01:13:41.458
if you don't get me
where I need to go.

01:13:41.626 --> 01:13:42.834
She's talking sense.

01:13:43.294 --> 01:13:44.544
Coker, please.

01:13:44.837 --> 01:13:46.296
So now we need to know.

01:13:46.839 --> 01:13:48.632
You tell me
why we're here.

01:13:49.175 --> 01:13:52.219
It's an automated
Cylon transmission array.

01:13:52.595 --> 01:13:56.056
Once we gain access,
I will upload a virus.

01:13:59.352 --> 01:14:02.020
Can you please take
the gun off my chest?

01:14:04.065 --> 01:14:05.190
Please.

01:14:07.735 --> 01:14:08.777
Keep talking.

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:14.199
I will upload a virus that is
designed to blind their defenses.

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:16.701
A virus I have
been carrying in this.

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:25.293
What, you didn't trust me
enough to tell me this before?

01:14:27.046 --> 01:14:29.297
No. I'm sorry.

01:14:30.633 --> 01:14:32.050
I trust you now.

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:35.387
Good.

01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:39.015
Then we're communicating.

01:14:41.394 --> 01:14:42.769
Tell us the rest.

01:14:45.398 --> 01:14:47.232
Make sure there are
no more surprises.

01:14:50.194 --> 01:14:52.863
Like I said, it's an automated
Cylon transmission array

01:14:52.947 --> 01:14:56.741
about six klicks from here, so if we
leave now, we'll make it before nightfall.

01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:05.500
The facility is automated,

01:15:05.751 --> 01:15:08.545
so we shouldn't run into
too many Centurion guards.

01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:11.923
That is, if we're careful not to
trip the internal defense systems.

01:15:20.308 --> 01:15:23.226
The central corridor leads
directly to the control room.

01:15:23.477 --> 01:15:27.022
We'll need to access one of their
com channels to upload the virus.

01:15:27.106 --> 01:15:29.941
A virus that is designed to
spread through their entire network

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:32.152
and lie dormant
until we trigger it,

01:15:32.236 --> 01:15:35.614
disabling all of their communications
in advance of an attack.

01:15:38.451 --> 01:15:39.951
Clear.

01:16:02.016 --> 01:16:03.016
What is it?

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:04.100
Thought I saw something.

01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:06.895
Guess I'm just jumpy.

01:16:21.327 --> 01:16:22.410
We're in.

01:16:22.495 --> 01:16:24.955
Come on, Becca, hurry with
that thing, all right? Come on.

01:16:25.039 --> 01:16:26.289
It's a large program.
It'll take a...

01:16:29.835 --> 01:16:31.294
- No.
- Stop.

01:16:31.379 --> 01:16:32.754
Put it down.

01:16:33.589 --> 01:16:35.507
Put the gun down now, Husker,
I will shoot you.

01:16:39.512 --> 01:16:41.012
This frakking bitch
is working for them!

01:16:41.222 --> 01:16:42.722
- What?
- She's a Cylon spy!

01:16:43.307 --> 01:16:44.349
No.

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:46.434
How the frak do l
stop this thing?

01:16:46.519 --> 01:16:48.186
A spy? Coker,
how could she be a spy?

01:16:48.312 --> 01:16:49.771
Ask her about the hotel.

01:16:50.064 --> 01:16:52.190
About the Cylon that stopped and scanned her.

01:16:52.275 --> 01:16:53.984
- What?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

01:16:54.068 --> 01:16:56.278
- What hotel?
- That frakking toaster had you dead to rights

01:16:56.362 --> 01:16:57.779
and then it saw
this thing and it froze.

01:16:57.863 --> 01:16:59.364
Can you explain that to me?

01:16:59.490 --> 01:17:01.241
Can you?

01:17:01.534 --> 01:17:03.868
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- Coker.

01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:07.747
Put the gun down on the
floor and calm down, okay?

01:17:07.832 --> 01:17:09.666
- Drop the gun.
- Oh, frak.

01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:11.668
It's not a virus,
it's a recording device.

01:17:12.253 --> 01:17:14.337
- What?
- Oh, frak!

01:17:14.422 --> 01:17:15.797
You're giving them
all the info

01:17:15.881 --> 01:17:16.881
on the ghost ships,
aren't you?

01:17:16.966 --> 01:17:18.717
You frakking bitch!

01:17:18.801 --> 01:17:21.469
That's why they destroyed the Archeron.
So that Colonial intel...

01:17:25.433 --> 01:17:26.516
Coker!

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:29.185
Stop.

01:17:30.521 --> 01:17:32.105
I will shoot you
if I have to.

01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:33.356
What?

01:17:34.108 --> 01:17:36.151
Oh, no! No!

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:38.903
I thought you wanted
to end this war.

01:17:39.572 --> 01:17:41.906
It'll end when we realize
that we can't win.

01:17:42.867 --> 01:17:43.908
That we have to negotiate.

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:45.201
Negotiate?

01:17:46.245 --> 01:17:48.246
For the last 10 years they've
been trying to wipe us out.

01:17:48.331 --> 01:17:51.708
Stop. They were just
defending themselves.

01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:52.876
No.

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:55.462
They value life
more than we do!

01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:58.006
You saw what was in
that freezer, Becca.

01:17:58.090 --> 01:17:59.049
Stop.

01:17:59.133 --> 01:18:00.800
Was that them
defending themselves?

01:18:01.344 --> 01:18:03.136
Was that them
valuing life?

01:18:03.971 --> 01:18:06.848
They're robots,
Becca, okay?

01:18:08.184 --> 01:18:09.434
That's all they are.

01:18:09.643 --> 01:18:10.977
Soulless...

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.477
- You okay, buddy? You all right?
- Coker, you okay?

01:18:52.812 --> 01:18:54.187
Stop the upload.

01:18:58.818 --> 01:19:00.819
It's all in Cylon.
I can't make it out.

01:19:00.945 --> 01:19:04.364
Well, then go
to plan B, kid.

01:19:28.848 --> 01:19:30.223
Come on. Come on.

01:19:30.307 --> 01:19:32.100
No, no, no, it's...
It's no good.

01:19:32.184 --> 01:19:33.977
It stopped but I don't know
how much has already been sent.

01:19:34.061 --> 01:19:35.603
Then stop wasting time
and get yourseIf out of here!

01:19:35.688 --> 01:19:37.605
You think I'm gonna start
listening to you now, huh?

01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:38.507
Come on!

01:20:35.748 --> 01:20:36.873
Okay.

01:20:37.583 --> 01:20:38.958
This is far enough.

01:20:39.752 --> 01:20:41.044
Put me down.

01:20:42.922 --> 01:20:44.589
I said put me down!

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:17.455
Shouldn't
be long now.

01:21:34.848 --> 01:21:36.724
Hold onto that for me.

01:21:39.186 --> 01:21:40.645
Who is this?

01:21:42.398 --> 01:21:43.815
It's Katie.

01:21:46.026 --> 01:21:47.402
My wife.

01:21:58.998 --> 01:22:00.498
Why didn't you tell me?

01:22:10.092 --> 01:22:11.509
Sometimes you...

01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:15.597
You miss something
too much...

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:23.479
You wouldn't
understand, kid.

01:22:28.611 --> 01:22:31.070
You got lousy taste in women.

01:22:34.867 --> 01:22:36.367
But you're all right, Husker.

01:22:55.137 --> 01:22:56.346
Coker?

01:23:50.442 --> 01:23:51.818
Are you alive?

01:24:14.133 --> 01:24:15.842
Do you think because
you're more enlightened

01:24:15.926 --> 01:24:17.677
than the rest
of your species,

01:24:18.387 --> 01:24:20.346
we hate you any less?

01:24:32.484 --> 01:24:33.901
There's our young hero.

01:24:34.236 --> 01:24:35.778
At ease, son.

01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:37.697
How you feeling
today, Ensign?

01:24:37.781 --> 01:24:38.740
Ready to get
out of here, sir.

01:24:38.824 --> 01:24:39.824
That's the spirit.

01:24:40.492 --> 01:24:43.786
In the meantime, I wanted you to
review your after-action report.

01:24:44.663 --> 01:24:47.331
Command made a few changes
they need you to sign off on.

01:24:50.753 --> 01:24:52.462
Guess they felt you were
a little hard on yourself.

01:24:52.546 --> 01:24:55.214
Sir, this report says that our
mission was a complete success.

01:24:58.886 --> 01:25:00.887
- That's just a lie.
- Was it?

01:25:06.852 --> 01:25:08.186
You knew.

01:25:11.607 --> 01:25:13.357
You wanted her to
upload that data.

01:25:15.319 --> 01:25:16.694
So when the Cylons attacked,
the fleet...

01:25:16.779 --> 01:25:17.862
Was long gone.

01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:24.076
We hit every toaster base in five
sectors, inflicted some major damage.

01:25:25.454 --> 01:25:27.914
For a while anyway, they're
going to be on the defensive.

01:25:27.998 --> 01:25:29.373
And what about the Osiris?

01:25:31.168 --> 01:25:32.877
What about all those
people who died?

01:25:33.587 --> 01:25:36.547
You mean all those people
who gave their lives. Right?

01:25:40.844 --> 01:25:42.220
- You disapprove?
- Yes.

01:25:42.304 --> 01:25:43.721
- You feel used?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:25:43.889 --> 01:25:45.890
Well, I'm sorry, son, but
there's a bit more at stake here

01:25:45.974 --> 01:25:47.725
than your personal
sense of integrity.

01:25:49.561 --> 01:25:52.563
The truth is that the people
support this war with their money,

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:54.899
and they will stop if
we stop giving them hope.

01:25:56.652 --> 01:25:57.902
So let them have
their heroes,

01:25:57.986 --> 01:25:59.529
let them have their
unblemished victories,

01:25:59.613 --> 01:26:01.405
while you and l
fight the real war.

01:26:02.032 --> 01:26:03.241
Yes?

01:26:16.588 --> 01:26:17.755
Good.

01:26:21.552 --> 01:26:23.594
We're assembling
a joint task force.

01:26:23.846 --> 01:26:25.888
Our best pilots,
Marines and infantry units

01:26:25.973 --> 01:26:27.932
for special ops
throughout the war theater.

01:26:28.892 --> 01:26:30.643
In case you want
to volunteer,

01:26:30.727 --> 01:26:32.436
there's a shiny new Viper
with your name on it

01:26:32.521 --> 01:26:33.980
waiting for you
in the hangar bay.

01:26:34.314 --> 01:26:36.649
Well, maybe not with
your name on it just yet.

01:26:37.651 --> 01:26:39.527
I hear you still have
to pick out a call sign.

01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:43.239
- You think about it.
- Yeah.

01:27:04.678 --> 01:27:06.220
What? No cocky comebacks?

01:27:09.141 --> 01:27:11.225
You look like shit.

01:27:13.478 --> 01:27:14.729
You're one to talk.

01:27:20.903 --> 01:27:22.570
You going home?

01:27:24.489 --> 01:27:27.700
Well, I got six weeks
left in my tour,

01:27:27.784 --> 01:27:29.493
so I figure I'll
stick around that long.

01:27:31.163 --> 01:27:32.830
Long as I don't
have to fly with you.

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:58.272
Dear Dad,
I got your last letter.

01:27:58.357 --> 01:28:01.192
You're right about
preconceptions being dangerous,

01:28:01.276 --> 01:28:02.860
and not just in court.

01:28:03.195 --> 01:28:05.613
This war is turning out to be
different than I expected.

01:28:05.697 --> 01:28:08.699
But maybe my mistake
was to have expectations.

01:28:09.159 --> 01:28:11.953
It's something you have to live
inside of to really understand.

01:28:12.996 --> 01:28:15.122
While a part of me
already hates it,

01:28:15.207 --> 01:28:17.875
another part knows that
I'll make soldiering my life.

01:28:18.418 --> 01:28:20.419
But this is
the life I've chosen,

01:28:20.504 --> 01:28:23.464
and this crew,
it's my family now, too.

01:28:24.257 --> 01:28:26.050
Because I'll tell
you something else,

01:28:26.426 --> 01:28:30.304
when this war is over,
and some day it will be,

01:28:30.931 --> 01:28:33.015
what I'll remember most
are not the battles,

01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:35.393
but the men and women
who fought them with me.

01:28:35.686 --> 01:28:37.478
And I will miss them.
