It was the summer of 2019.

00:16.594 --> 00:18.677
We conservatives
had been forced

00:18.765 --> 00:20.478
to the margins of society.

00:20.565 --> 00:23.771
Why is Facebook censoring
conservative bloggers

00:23.859 --> 00:25.311
such as
Diamond and Silk?

00:25.399 --> 00:28.349
We barely controlled
three branches of government

00:28.437 --> 00:30.052
and could only show our faces

00:30.140 --> 00:32.682
at exclusive
luxury beach resorts.

00:32.769 --> 00:34.771
Many by now have heard
that I was asked

00:34.859 --> 00:36.133
to leave a restaurant
this weekend

00:36.220 --> 00:38.194
where I attempted
to have dinner with my family.

00:38.336 --> 00:42.068
But one day, a humble,
powerless president

00:42.156 --> 00:45.617
stood up and said, "No more."

00:46.015 --> 00:48.099
Aah!

00:54.494 --> 00:58.021
This new legislation
will assure election integrity

00:58.109 --> 01:01.305
by mandating that all of Atlanta
share one ballot

01:01.393 --> 01:03.578
and you can only vote if you
just left Clint Eastwood's

01:03.729 --> 01:05.852
latest "white resentment"
blockbuster.

01:05.939 --> 01:08.892
And before you accuse me
of limiting minority access

01:08.979 --> 01:11.029
to the polls,
listen to this cabinet member

01:11.117 --> 01:13.031
I selected
for no particular reason.

01:13.119 --> 01:14.119
I'm cool with it.

01:14.207 --> 01:17.351
Oh-kay, Ben, as long
as you're cool with it.

01:17.439 --> 01:21.192
And to my supporters, harass
anyone who opposes this bill!

01:21.328 --> 01:24.172
Not that anyone will,
because Ben said it's fine.

01:24.371 --> 01:26.624
I'm Rachel Maddow,
and it's not a manic episode

01:26.712 --> 01:28.367
if it's been going on
for three years.

01:28.455 --> 01:30.618
Tonight, we're talking
about the President's

01:30.769 --> 01:33.423
new voting-rights bill
with Senator Elizabeth Warren.

01:33.511 --> 01:35.564
This law will
disproportionately

01:35.652 --> 01:37.935
affect Democrats
and minorities like me...

01:38.023 --> 01:39.226
A-and when I said "me"

01:39.314 --> 01:41.691
I was referring to
the Democrat part...

01:41.779 --> 01:42.952
Oh, shit!

01:43.040 --> 01:44.283
Dad, why are
all these people

01:44.371 --> 01:46.931
treating you like a loser
inner-city kindergarten teacher?

01:47.019 --> 01:48.947
Boys, you're old enough
to know

01:49.035 --> 01:52.488
about the deep generational
wound America has yet to heal...

01:52.665 --> 01:54.868
Bigotry against conservatives.

01:54.956 --> 01:58.033
I first experienced it
in 2011.

01:58.882 --> 02:01.416
I was just
trying to keep my head down

02:01.504 --> 02:03.087
and not ruffle feathers.

02:03.175 --> 02:04.878
Barack Obama
was born in Kenya,

02:04.966 --> 02:06.931
Mohamed Atta
was his college roommate,

02:07.019 --> 02:10.021
and I once talked Michelle
out of strangling a bald eagle.

02:10.109 --> 02:12.931
But Obama just couldn't let me
live my life.

02:13.019 --> 02:15.592
Uh, as you can see in my
long-form birth certificate,

02:15.737 --> 02:17.030
I was born in America,

02:17.118 --> 02:18.720
contrary to
Mr. Trump's assertion.

02:18.808 --> 02:20.431
He was merciless.

02:20.569 --> 02:22.022
He made me feel like I was not

02:22.110 --> 02:24.023
a rightful citizen
of this country!

02:24.111 --> 02:27.017
But conservatives contribute
so much to society.

02:27.105 --> 02:30.768
Arts, sciences, education...
We gutted all that boring shit!

02:30.856 --> 02:33.439
I just wish I showed courage
and fought back.

02:33.527 --> 02:36.353
I've regretted it even more
than telling that waitress,

02:36.441 --> 02:38.009
"We're all set
on breadsticks."

02:38.167 --> 02:41.391
I'm worried. Should I finally
move to Wichita

02:41.479 --> 02:44.017
and just open that
Halloween costume store?

02:44.105 --> 02:45.767
Yes, yes, absolutely yes.

02:45.855 --> 02:47.938
Your bags are in
an idling car outside.

02:48.026 --> 02:49.229
As for the rest of us,

02:49.317 --> 02:52.212
let's pray that tomorrow's
a better day.

Good morning, everyone,
from New York.

03:03.207 --> 03:06.195
We're learning the news
along with you.

03:06.283 --> 03:08.674
Twitter, Facebook,
and Instagram

03:08.762 --> 03:11.561
have handed down
a week-long suspension

03:11.649 --> 03:13.166
to a dozen
conservatives.

03:13.254 --> 03:14.627
- Aah!
- And for what?

03:14.715 --> 03:17.538
Simply sending credible
death threats to Trump critics.

03:17.626 --> 03:20.548
This is a worse violation
of rights than Jim Crow,

03:20.636 --> 03:23.337
which I'm absolutely sure
I would have marched against.

03:23.425 --> 03:25.173
One of the
suspended accounts

03:25.269 --> 03:27.432
belonged to noted
conservative and pundit

03:27.519 --> 03:30.759
who says he's not racist
but sure says "Detroit" a lot,

03:30.847 --> 03:32.550
Ben Shapiro,
seen here.

03:32.689 --> 03:34.222
Reparations make no sense

03:34.309 --> 03:36.682
since Obama marked
the end of racism, full-stop.

03:36.769 --> 03:38.972
Poor people are not entitled
to rich people's money,

03:39.059 --> 03:40.222
which they inherited
fair and square.

03:40.309 --> 03:43.572
Now, that's a weird, sexless
leader I want on my team.

03:43.660 --> 03:46.073
Also suspended...
Donald Trump Jr.

03:46.161 --> 03:48.486
What cruel god
would allow this?

03:48.908 --> 03:50.806
I'm just a little kid!

03:50.894 --> 03:52.937
It's only a matter of time
before they find out

03:53.025 --> 03:54.494
that I also tweet.

03:56.269 --> 03:58.009
The left is ferocious!

03:58.097 --> 04:01.579
They won't stop until we show
an inkling of self-reflection.

04:01.667 --> 04:02.642
Tell 'em, Ben.

04:02.730 --> 04:04.448
We must lead conservatives
out of the shadows.

04:04.535 --> 04:06.181
We can't even go
on a bus anymore

04:06.269 --> 04:08.541
without staring at a Muslim guy
and missing our stop!

04:08.629 --> 04:11.271
We must protect our right
to chant "MAGA"

04:11.359 --> 04:13.619
on a cross-country flight
without harassment.

04:13.707 --> 04:17.060
Everywhere I go,
people spit in my face

04:17.149 --> 04:19.666
and handcuff my right wrist
to my left ankle,

04:19.754 --> 04:22.947
and I'm pretty sure it's
because I'm a conservative!

04:23.035 --> 04:25.509
I agree with Ben Shapiro,
Stephen Miller, and Ted Cruz.

04:25.620 --> 04:26.953
Hold your horses.

04:27.041 --> 04:29.931
Susan Collins is all
for taking a stand,

04:30.019 --> 04:33.423
but not if it means
facing any consequences.

04:33.511 --> 04:35.134
Gotta say,
I agree with Collins.

04:35.222 --> 04:37.562
You can't agree
with both sides, Pompeo.

04:37.650 --> 04:38.275
I agree.

04:38.363 --> 04:40.416
But where will
the persecution end?

04:40.504 --> 04:41.997
Today, it's our
Twitter accounts.

04:42.085 --> 04:44.458
Tomorrow, it's our
Yahoo! accounts we only use

04:44.546 --> 04:46.209
for politically incorrect
chain letters.

04:46.297 --> 04:48.040
Will we ever laugh again?!

04:48.128 --> 04:49.431
If you ever
need a chuckle,

04:49.519 --> 04:51.762
you can always kick Pompeo
in the gonads.

04:51.849 --> 04:53.102
That goes
for all of you.

04:53.189 --> 04:54.501
Sorry to interject,

04:54.589 --> 04:56.931
but aren't we the most
powerful people on the planet?

04:57.042 --> 04:58.556
My name's on the money.

04:58.689 --> 05:02.072
If we're so powerful,
how come we're so whiny?!

05:02.160 --> 05:05.119
Mr. President, I support
everything you do,

05:05.220 --> 05:07.109
including when you installed
a pinball machine

05:07.197 --> 05:08.361
on John McCain's grave,

05:08.449 --> 05:11.134
but how do we overthrow
an oppressive system

05:11.222 --> 05:14.251
when our house
is divided?!

05:18.124 --> 05:19.407
Shut up!

05:19.495 --> 05:21.118
If there's one thing
we can agree on,

05:21.206 --> 05:23.392
it's we must kick
Pompeo's gonads.

05:23.519 --> 05:24.267
- Yeah!
- Yes!

05:24.355 --> 05:26.158
Great! Now line up.

05:27.562 --> 05:30.507
Just ask
Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi

05:30.595 --> 05:32.064
to get my account
reinstated!

05:32.152 --> 05:35.775
They're basically tech lobbyists
who do politics as a fun hobby.

05:35.863 --> 05:38.244
They won't listen to
a conservative like me.

05:38.332 --> 05:39.971
They don't think of me
as a person,

05:40.059 --> 05:41.852
especially after
I wore ripped shorts

05:41.939 --> 05:43.472
and walked on all fours
to mess with them.

05:43.559 --> 05:47.182
Dad, I consider myself an alpha
male with rhinoceros skin,

05:47.269 --> 05:49.682
but right now this lil' dinosaur
needs some help.

05:49.769 --> 05:51.392
I've never helped anyone,

05:51.479 --> 05:54.399
and I'm not about to lose
my H-Card with you.

05:56.298 --> 05:57.682
Why are you so upset?

05:57.769 --> 06:00.783
Is it because you can't harass
Parkland kids while we bone?

06:00.871 --> 06:03.324
When you're in your forties
and still growing up,

06:03.412 --> 06:05.535
your dad is supposed
to be there for you.

06:05.623 --> 06:07.101
Ah, you're getting
so emotional!

06:07.189 --> 06:08.946
Are you about to ask me
to marry you in an opulent,

06:09.034 --> 06:10.431
Cleopatra-themed wedding
this weekend

06:10.519 --> 06:11.548
at the
Fontainebleau Miami?

06:11.636 --> 06:13.049
Because I booked it,
just in case.

06:13.137 --> 06:14.634
I am not emotional!

06:14.722 --> 06:16.675
I'm just gonna be
a big strong man

06:16.763 --> 06:19.676
and ask Chuck and Nancy
to fix this problem for me!

06:19.764 --> 06:21.547
My crack is sober...
You know what to do.

06:21.635 --> 06:24.173
One beer down the crack,
coming up.

06:24.830 --> 06:26.470
The oppression of conservatives

06:26.558 --> 06:28.244
is becoming
too much to bear.

06:28.332 --> 06:30.103
Uh, no doy!

06:30.198 --> 06:31.837
After my
confirmation hearing,

06:31.925 --> 06:34.541
I couldn't show my face
at O'Shittery's Beer Dump

06:34.629 --> 06:36.582
for three whole
Thirsty Thursdays!

06:36.670 --> 06:39.253
If only there was a way to throw
a big enough tantrum

06:39.341 --> 06:42.439
that this nation gives us
what we want just to shut us up.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.780
Oh, but there is...

06:44.914 --> 06:47.681
What's this a photo of...
A bag of congealed oatmeal?

06:47.769 --> 06:49.455
It's me havin' a good cry!

06:49.543 --> 06:52.595
Do the same until the tears
make such a huge puddle,

06:52.683 --> 06:55.186
it won't be clear
if it's tears or pee.

06:55.274 --> 06:56.727
Everyone will be
afraid to ask,

06:56.815 --> 06:59.275
so they'll just take whiffs
to see if they can smell pee.

06:59.399 --> 07:02.673
Once they're sure it's not pee,
they'll be so grateful,

07:02.761 --> 07:05.095
you'll get exactly
what you want from them.

07:05.183 --> 07:07.346
You're overselling it.
I'll do it!

07:07.434 --> 07:10.626
This country will finally
become a safe space

07:10.714 --> 07:14.189
for everyone who whines
about safe spaces.

07:22.276 --> 07:25.819
The doctors say his gonads
have a long road ahead for them,

07:25.907 --> 07:28.190
so let's hear some love
for Pompeo.

07:28.307 --> 07:29.845
Keep it up, slugger!

07:29.933 --> 07:31.908
Doctor said he's never
seen anything like it.

07:31.996 --> 07:34.525
And a heads up
that Ben Shapiro and I

07:34.613 --> 07:37.064
are leading a movement for
equal rights for conservatives.

07:37.152 --> 07:39.101
- Whoa!
- You're moving too fast!

07:39.189 --> 07:40.947
Society's not ready
for this!

07:41.035 --> 07:43.271
For too long, conservatives
have been in the shadows,

07:43.359 --> 07:46.533
and it's time to show America
that we won't stand for it.

07:46.621 --> 07:49.330
Uh, we have all the money
and all the power.

07:49.479 --> 07:52.611
The only movement I'm for
is to save Pompeo's baby maker.

07:52.699 --> 07:54.580
The doctor said
that's not in the cards.

07:55.470 --> 07:56.572
The stories
of oppression

07:56.660 --> 07:58.061
you're about to hear
are harrowing.

07:58.149 --> 07:59.159
I hope you didn't
eat breakfast.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.556
To be honest, once breakfast
is put in front of me,

08:01.644 --> 08:03.727
I kind of black out,
and next thing you know,

08:03.815 --> 08:05.648
I have to change my shirt.

08:05.899 --> 08:07.312
I was supposed to speak

08:07.399 --> 08:09.182
at University
of California, Berkeley,

08:09.269 --> 08:11.472
about why white people
deserve reparations

08:11.559 --> 08:14.852
for all the times we had to
feel guilty about being white,

08:14.939 --> 08:16.892
and I was run off campus!

08:17.998 --> 08:20.471
YouTube refused
to host my videos

08:20.559 --> 08:23.126
just because I said
all school shooting victims

08:23.214 --> 08:25.627
were portrayed by Oscar-winning
actress Brie Larson

08:25.715 --> 08:27.783
in the performance
of a lifetime!

08:27.892 --> 08:29.555
I just wanna hug him.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.976
So, I'm sprintin' down
a dark freeway

08:32.043 --> 08:33.845
wearing only what God gave me,

08:33.933 --> 08:37.322
and a legion of bikers
is bearin' down on me so close

08:37.470 --> 08:40.431
that their side mirrors
are knockin' my funny bones.

08:40.519 --> 08:43.304
One of the angrier fellas
who had a toddler

08:43.392 --> 08:46.142
smokin' a cigarette
balanced on his handlebars

08:46.230 --> 08:49.158
must've put out a call
because, next thing I know,

08:49.246 --> 08:52.869
green glass bottles are
rainin' down from the overpass

08:52.957 --> 08:54.870
on every side,
and I'm thinking,

08:54.958 --> 08:57.531
"Does this road
ever go downhill?!"

08:57.619 --> 09:00.603
Wow! All for being
a conservative.

09:00.691 --> 09:02.811
Maybe, but more likely I'd say

09:02.899 --> 09:05.939
any one of the nine things
I did that night.

09:06.124 --> 09:08.101
There's a line around
the White House

09:08.189 --> 09:10.062
of conservatives
ready to complain.

09:10.149 --> 09:12.316
How did it get this bad?

09:12.404 --> 09:13.676
Somewhere along the way,

09:13.764 --> 09:16.307
it became okay to discriminate
based on the color

09:16.439 --> 09:18.777
you paint your face
at fraternity parties.

09:20.548 --> 09:22.754
Well,
would you look at this!

09:22.842 --> 09:25.385
Donald Trump Jr.
In my office.

09:25.492 --> 09:28.525
This must be some kind of trick,
so I got the twins ready...

09:28.613 --> 09:30.066
Julian and Joaquin.

09:30.154 --> 09:31.777
I'm not here to wrestle
for dominance.

09:31.865 --> 09:33.812
I'm here to ask for help
getting my Twitter back

09:33.900 --> 09:36.143
before some kid thinks
he can protest climate change

09:36.231 --> 09:38.738
without his sexual orientation
being questioned.

09:39.340 --> 09:40.476
Sure. Why not?

09:40.564 --> 09:42.021
Wait. You're just
gonna help me?

09:42.109 --> 09:43.801
Whenever my dad
does me a favor,

09:43.889 --> 09:46.472
he increases the licensing fee
on my own last name.

09:46.560 --> 09:47.879
Sometimes you tweet
a picture

09:47.967 --> 09:50.051
of Ocasio-Cortez
with devil horns...

09:50.139 --> 09:52.605
And we just
laugh and laugh...

09:52.693 --> 09:54.426
Well, great seeing you.

09:54.559 --> 09:57.574
Tell your father we have
a budget resolution to cave on.

09:57.913 --> 10:00.348
Don, why aren't
you leaving?

10:00.436 --> 10:03.340
Sorry. It's just, you guys
not treating me like ass...

10:03.428 --> 10:05.746
I'm not used to that kind
of parental warmth.

10:05.834 --> 10:08.197
Hey, you guys wanna
get ice cream?! Yeah!

10:08.324 --> 10:10.363
Nancy, Chuck, come on!

10:11.730 --> 10:13.410
One of
the most effective tactics

10:13.498 --> 10:16.066
in any civil-rights movement
is the non-violent protest

10:16.154 --> 10:17.840
that shocks the nation
out of complacency.

10:17.928 --> 10:19.391
That's where
you come in, Stevie.

10:19.479 --> 10:21.369
We need you to step
onto a liberal campus

10:21.457 --> 10:22.432
and get your ass kicked.

10:22.519 --> 10:24.102
And for your efforts,
we offer you...

10:24.189 --> 10:25.949
Nothing necessary.
I live for this.

10:26.037 --> 10:27.356
Good, because that
was the offer.

10:27.444 --> 10:28.725
But what if my natural charm

10:28.813 --> 10:31.004
makes Antifa
refuse to attack me?

10:31.092 --> 10:32.473
Then just
make up a story.

10:32.561 --> 10:34.754
Keep it simple so no one
pokes holes in it.

10:34.842 --> 10:37.135
So then the seven-foot
art-history major

10:37.223 --> 10:39.216
raised his battle axe
and roared,

10:39.304 --> 10:42.348
"Name thyself, conservative
who hath dared pass hither!"

10:42.436 --> 10:46.387
I replied, "Lo, I am an
innocent carpenter's apprentice

10:46.475 --> 10:49.691
here to spread the good news
of common-sense baby caging."

10:49.949 --> 10:51.431
A carpenter's apprentice?

10:51.519 --> 10:54.004
As the vape-smoking beast
chained me to the rack,

10:54.092 --> 10:56.293
his fellow Antifa
begged for my guts

10:56.381 --> 10:57.912
while big-bosomed maidens

10:58.019 --> 11:00.562
cried out for mercy
on the handsome stranger.

11:00.649 --> 11:02.102
Damn it. I'm starting
to get invested.

11:02.189 --> 11:03.683
How did you get out?
Did you use

11:03.771 --> 11:05.339
the sorcerer's gem stone
you found in the brook?

11:05.427 --> 11:07.084
A tale for another day!

11:07.172 --> 11:08.147
- Aww.
- The point is...

11:08.195 --> 11:09.253
If people bought it,

11:09.341 --> 11:11.472
there should be rioting
in the streets.

11:12.248 --> 11:13.560
Nope.

11:13.648 --> 11:16.412
Oh hoh!
Whoa!

11:16.552 --> 11:17.904
This thing is great!

11:17.992 --> 11:19.357
My dad never
let me ride one

11:19.445 --> 11:22.068
because he could tell
I enjoyed it too much.

11:22.359 --> 11:24.951
Whoa!
What happened?!

11:25.039 --> 11:26.365
It's just out of time,
buddy.

11:26.453 --> 11:29.236
You can do one more ride,
but then Nancy and I

11:29.324 --> 11:31.623
have to go back and run
the United States Congress.

11:31.711 --> 11:33.174
One and then one more?

11:33.359 --> 11:35.295
- Fine.
- Yeeeaahhh!

11:35.383 --> 11:38.115
And watch me this time
and give me encouragement!

11:38.203 --> 11:39.602
- Are you watching?
- We're watching.

11:39.689 --> 11:41.006
- Look here!
- Oh, yeah!

11:41.094 --> 11:42.272
I think... I got air!

11:42.366 --> 11:43.776
- Sure. You got air.
- Oh, wow!

11:46.482 --> 11:48.142
Oh, my God.
He's sleeping.

11:48.229 --> 11:50.123
Wake up, Don.
We're here.

11:50.211 --> 11:52.522
Whoa! Thanks for taking me
to Toy Story 4,

11:52.609 --> 11:55.352
and the gummy worms, and picture
next to the movie poster.

11:55.439 --> 11:58.062
Don't thank us.
You wouldn't stop crying

11:58.149 --> 12:01.341
and rolling on the ground
unless we did what you asked.

12:01.429 --> 12:04.219
Well, see you
again soon, champ.

12:05.352 --> 12:08.638
- Don. Everything alright?
- Yeah.

12:08.726 --> 12:10.632
Why aren't you getting out
and going to your home?

12:10.719 --> 12:12.561
- I love you guys.
- Oh, God.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.435
He's imprinted on us
like a duck.

12:14.523 --> 12:16.396
We have to keep him,
don't we?

12:16.484 --> 12:19.216
I heard that! Quack-quack!

12:20.052 --> 12:22.562
Nothing's working.
We need to take a big swing.

12:22.649 --> 12:25.168
How about an executive order
declaring conservatives

12:25.256 --> 12:26.668
are a protected class?
Pffff.

12:26.756 --> 12:28.498
The president
will never go for it.

12:28.586 --> 12:30.271
- What?
- He's got too much on his plate...

12:30.359 --> 12:31.849
Immigrants flooding
over the border,

12:31.937 --> 12:35.348
economic bubble about to pop...
He doesn't care about us.

12:35.436 --> 12:38.232
- Sir, you must know...
- So let me get this straight...

12:38.320 --> 12:41.052
You're just gonna waltz
into the White House,

12:41.189 --> 12:42.912
ask to see the President,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.272
and then after you're ushered
into his office,

12:45.375 --> 12:48.143
he'll say, "Sure, Ben,
whatever you want!"

12:48.231 --> 12:49.664
You're a fucking idiot!
Are you...

12:49.752 --> 12:52.393
It's over!
It'll never work!

12:52.481 --> 12:55.401
So quit living
in your fantasy world!

12:56.352 --> 12:58.456
Sir, did you actually
forget you were president?

12:58.544 --> 12:59.970
I remembered
in the middle,

13:00.058 --> 13:01.848
but it was too late
to turn back.

13:05.910 --> 13:09.917
This executive order
designates conservatives

13:10.005 --> 13:12.245
as a federally protected class,

13:12.333 --> 13:14.813
affording them
such equality measures

13:14.901 --> 13:16.392
as special parking spots

13:16.480 --> 13:20.233
and equal time for a right-wing
sketch comedy show.

13:20.359 --> 13:23.512
Hello, there's nothing
we can't have!

13:23.600 --> 13:24.611
Shut up, nerd!

13:24.699 --> 13:27.432
Boys, let's head
to O'Shittery's!

13:27.519 --> 13:30.352
If anybody looks at us weird,
we burn the place down!

13:30.439 --> 13:32.142
This isn't even
your branch of government.

13:32.229 --> 13:34.812
You're in
the wrong branch!

13:34.899 --> 13:36.312
Okay, you win, psycho.

13:36.399 --> 13:39.852
Welcome, all, to
the San Francisco Pride Parade.

13:39.939 --> 13:41.182
This is so much more fun

13:41.269 --> 13:43.522
than the "Dads For Family
Court Reform" Parade.

13:43.610 --> 13:44.971
And guess what.

13:45.059 --> 13:48.147
I just heard back from our
friends at Twitter headquarters.

13:48.235 --> 13:51.601
We got them to lift
your week-long suspension!

13:51.689 --> 13:55.312
And it only took seven days.
Celebratory selfie!

13:55.399 --> 13:57.642
Say, "I love you and
will always be there for you

13:57.729 --> 14:00.395
in a way that
no one ever haaaassss!"

14:00.500 --> 14:02.141
Well, you're back
on Twitter,

14:02.229 --> 14:04.614
so I guess you don't
need us anymore.

14:04.729 --> 14:06.602
Wait, wait! Oh!
You haven't met Kimberly yet!

14:06.689 --> 14:09.762
You're gonna love her.
She has this hilarious story

14:09.849 --> 14:12.522
about making fun
of a cameraman's gross birthmark

14:12.609 --> 14:14.812
and then it turned out
to be cancer.

14:14.899 --> 14:16.562
She can tell it better.

14:16.649 --> 14:18.182
Tune in to NBC

14:18.269 --> 14:19.762
on Sunday night
for the premiere of

14:19.849 --> 14:22.522
"Koch Industries Presents:
Sunday Night Live"

14:22.609 --> 14:25.682
with host Charlie Kirk
and musical guest Rand Paul,

14:25.823 --> 14:28.529
featuring a digital short
on Planned Parenthood.

14:29.229 --> 14:31.439
I'm gonna be groggy
Monday morning.

14:37.269 --> 14:38.432
Hey. Good morning.

14:42.790 --> 14:45.435
First you go to the gay pride
parade with Chuck and Nancy

14:45.523 --> 14:46.964
and now we're having
dinner with them?

14:47.052 --> 14:50.293
They're a little kooky, but
great if you get to know them.

14:50.381 --> 14:52.004
You got a flyaway hair
right over your...

14:52.092 --> 14:54.261
- Is this her?
- Hello, Kimberly.

14:54.349 --> 14:56.382
You're even cuter
than Don said you were!

14:56.470 --> 14:59.181
Nancy, take the lamb
out of the oven! They're here!

14:59.269 --> 15:00.392
Ahh. What?!

15:00.479 --> 15:02.755
They're here!
Lamb! Now!

15:02.843 --> 15:04.982
So, then Steny Hoyer
says to Dick Durbin,

15:05.070 --> 15:07.037
"Why are you wearing
flip-flops?"

15:07.125 --> 15:09.709
Ahh...

15:09.880 --> 15:13.022
So, Don tells us you're
a conservative firebrand.

15:13.109 --> 15:14.432
Is that fun?

15:14.519 --> 15:16.892
It's the best.
I trigger so many liberals.

15:16.979 --> 15:20.472
Oh, but long-term, she wants
to be an archaeologist.

15:20.559 --> 15:22.005
What? I don't even know
what that is.

15:22.093 --> 15:23.404
I don't either.
Just go with it.

15:23.492 --> 15:26.724
It's fine. Let's just
talk about something else.

15:31.141 --> 15:32.184
Need some wine.

15:32.272 --> 15:33.310
Need some lamb in my...

15:33.398 --> 15:36.130
Ohh! Uh, did you see Don
at the gay pride parade?

15:36.218 --> 15:39.832
I did! Wow!
I haven't seen him that happy

15:39.920 --> 15:42.443
since he blew that silverback's
head off at two yards.

15:42.531 --> 15:44.138
And did he tell you
that, next weekend,

15:44.226 --> 15:45.943
we're gonna go see
glaciers melting?

15:46.031 --> 15:47.314
Oh, the same weekend

15:47.402 --> 15:50.195
as my best friend Katelyn's
gender-reveal party

15:50.283 --> 15:52.276
where they're gonna stuff
a grenade in the cake?

15:52.364 --> 15:54.709
We can just skip it
and go to the birth.

15:56.107 --> 15:58.530
I thought you were just getting
your Twitter account reinstated,

15:58.617 --> 16:00.310
not becoming Al Gore!

16:00.397 --> 16:02.190
My relationship
with Mom and D...

16:02.277 --> 16:04.150
Nancy and Chuck
isn't political!

16:04.237 --> 16:06.402
We're just developing
an emotional connection

16:06.490 --> 16:08.011
as we defend
the nurse's union

16:08.099 --> 16:11.128
and lock arms with the victims
of Standing Rock. Oh, shit!

16:11.216 --> 16:15.029
This is not the selfish brat
I courted to advance my career!

16:15.130 --> 16:16.400
I'm still
a selfish brat.

16:16.487 --> 16:19.019
Uh, I'll go steal a package
off someone's porch right now!

16:19.107 --> 16:21.332
As hot as that sounds,
I'm over it.

16:21.420 --> 16:22.707
Good luck getting
Chuck and Nancy

16:22.795 --> 16:24.763
to pour beer
down your crack.

16:32.317 --> 16:35.341
Why is everyone mad
at someone who isn't Pompeo?

16:35.429 --> 16:37.912
I'll start. Earlier today,
I was minding my own business,

16:38.029 --> 16:39.849
and someone said,
"Good morning."

16:40.747 --> 16:44.149
I'm fine, but I just keep
thinking about what he meant.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.871
"Good morning,
you sad, pathetic weakling

16:46.959 --> 16:49.176
who couldn't even get the
teachers to eat lunch with him.

16:49.263 --> 16:51.269
You speak really quickly
and confidently,

16:51.357 --> 16:55.324
but deep down you know
you're 100% full of shit!"

16:55.412 --> 16:56.879
Everyone thinks
that because we elected

16:56.966 --> 16:59.770
one conservative president,
we finally gained equality,

16:59.857 --> 17:01.277
and that damn
executive order

17:01.365 --> 17:03.433
just gave them even more cover
to hold us down!

17:03.521 --> 17:06.644
We should've listened to
Susan Collins and done nothing.

17:06.732 --> 17:09.020
Sure, we were
only rich and powerful,

17:09.107 --> 17:10.770
but at least
we were happy.

17:10.857 --> 17:14.359
Wrong! We need a public
demonstration so big and bold

17:14.446 --> 17:16.520
that it shifts
the entire cultural paradigm.

17:16.607 --> 17:18.824
- I'm talking a million...
- Wow!

17:18.912 --> 17:20.347
- Man...
- That's me!

17:20.435 --> 17:22.097
- March!
- I'm out!

17:22.185 --> 17:25.230
So this cause isn't important
enough for you to walk?!

17:25.318 --> 17:26.746
I'm all for equal rights,

17:26.834 --> 17:28.927
but not if it makes
my hammies sore.

17:29.067 --> 17:32.169
And to think
I believed in you...

17:32.590 --> 17:35.423
Would it make you feel better
if you kicked me in the gonads?

17:35.556 --> 17:36.888
Yeah.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.613
I'd now like to introduce

17:39.701 --> 17:42.488
- Senate bill 2-9-4-3...
- Hey!

17:42.576 --> 17:44.170
Thanks a lot, Chuck!

17:44.293 --> 17:46.152
There's my boy!
Nancy and I thought

17:46.240 --> 17:48.230
dinner with Kimberly
was a real home run.

17:48.318 --> 17:52.185
More like a loose bat into the
singing hot-dog guy's throat!

17:52.273 --> 17:54.232
Kimberly broke up with me!

17:54.677 --> 17:57.326
To be honest, Nancy and I
thought that girl was bad news.

17:57.414 --> 17:58.894
We found condoms
in her purse.

17:58.982 --> 18:02.253
Ugh! I'm sick of you
always trying to control me!

18:02.341 --> 18:05.185
I'm not gonna go to law school,
get married,

18:05.273 --> 18:07.167
and become
some uptight senator!

18:07.255 --> 18:09.066
Don, I've known you
for maybe eight days.

18:09.154 --> 18:11.270
Are we going to vote
on the bill?

18:11.357 --> 18:13.644
I can't wait
to vote "present."

18:13.732 --> 18:16.027
Don't ever ask
Chuck and Nancy for help

18:16.115 --> 18:19.552
because you'll let them into
your heart and they'll break it!

18:19.755 --> 18:21.060
I cede my time!

18:21.147 --> 18:23.110
That's not how
this works, Don.

18:23.197 --> 18:25.270
- <i>Fuck you!</i>
- Present!

18:25.459 --> 18:28.105
What's your glitch,
Shapiro?

18:28.193 --> 18:30.910
In 2016, I wasn't sure
a nihilistic game-show host

18:30.998 --> 18:32.137
accused of
numerous sex crimes

18:32.224 --> 18:34.061
should be the leader
of the conservative movement.

18:34.148 --> 18:36.224
But then you were elected
president, and I realized,

18:36.312 --> 18:38.170
"Supporting him boosts
my website's traffic."

18:38.258 --> 18:40.671
But I was wrong. You don't
care about conservatism.

18:40.759 --> 18:42.382
You just care about you!

18:42.470 --> 18:45.053
Obviously, I don't care
about conservatism!

18:45.141 --> 18:48.214
I just asked someone which party
has the best racist jokes

18:48.302 --> 18:49.715
and said, "I'm that!"

18:49.803 --> 18:52.912
And guess what! I'm not
telling you any of them!

18:53.052 --> 18:54.341
<i>Go to hell!</i>

18:54.429 --> 18:57.927
Ever since I told that waitress
to stop bringing breadsticks,

18:58.015 --> 18:59.624
I've been living in it!

18:59.712 --> 19:01.630
<i>What are you talking about?!</i>

19:03.796 --> 19:06.670
Live from the
Charles Krauthammer Theater,

19:06.758 --> 19:08.721
it's "Sunday Night Live"!

19:08.842 --> 19:11.755
And here's your host,
Mike Pompeo!

19:11.843 --> 19:14.775
They asked Pompeo and not me?

19:15.341 --> 19:17.256
I'm here
to throw you in jail

19:17.344 --> 19:20.177
for calling someone
the wrong pronoun.

19:20.401 --> 19:23.318
This is only gonna
normalize Pompeo.

19:24.125 --> 19:27.414
So if you were, like, my dad,
what kind of stuff would we do?

19:27.502 --> 19:28.915
Of course.
Uh, we'd go to the movies!

19:29.002 --> 19:30.107
Ooh, that sounds fun.

19:30.195 --> 19:32.480
Yeah, there's this
little underground theater

19:32.568 --> 19:34.855
in a cement basement
on 11th Avenue,

19:34.943 --> 19:36.623
and the movies
they show there,

19:36.711 --> 19:38.670
there's so much blood
and depravity,

19:38.758 --> 19:40.292
I don't know how they
snuck them out of Dresden.

19:40.379 --> 19:42.172
Any other
bonding activities?

19:42.260 --> 19:44.793
Ever been on a police ride-along
when they turn off the cameras?

19:44.881 --> 19:47.253
Ha! You will walk away
with so many secrets.

19:47.341 --> 19:49.124
Yeah, I don't know
if this is gonna work.

19:49.212 --> 19:50.965
Look, if it changes your mind,
I'll take you to a ball game.

19:51.052 --> 19:53.152
I got this luxury box
at Yankee Stadium

19:53.240 --> 19:55.964
that's entirely bricked off...
No one can see in or out.

19:56.052 --> 19:58.300
Got an over-caffeinated
12-year-old bartender...

19:58.388 --> 20:00.654
Yeah, I don't know
if this is gonna work.

20:02.171 --> 20:04.630
Thanks for watching
"Sunday Night Live."

20:04.718 --> 20:07.391
Thank you,
Tomi Lahren, Dinesh D'Souza,

20:07.479 --> 20:10.373
Jacob Wohl, Diamond, Silk...

20:10.461 --> 20:13.177
<i>uh, Michael Flynn,
uh, Michael Flynn Jr...</i>

20:13.265 --> 20:15.091
Yeah, that might be
Stephen Miller.

20:15.179 --> 20:17.607
Are all the nurses pretending
they're on lunch break?

20:17.695 --> 20:19.405
Yep, that's him.
Good night.

20:20.803 --> 20:24.086
Oh, my God. Stevie.
What happened?

20:24.212 --> 20:26.165
Were you attacked
just for what you believe?

20:26.252 --> 20:29.623
Sort of. I was sitting in
a conservatives-only seat

20:29.711 --> 20:31.662
at the movie theater,
and someone told me

20:31.750 --> 20:33.380
to move my big head
a little.

20:33.468 --> 20:36.584
It hurt my feelings so bad,
I called 911.

20:37.966 --> 20:39.708
I'm not sure
how much longer I have

20:39.796 --> 20:42.079
because the doctor
refuses to examine me.

20:42.167 --> 20:44.170
Stevie, Stevie.

20:44.258 --> 20:46.581
You're gonna make it,
God damn it!

20:46.669 --> 20:48.964
If you can survive every
roommate you've ever had

20:49.052 --> 20:50.904
"accidentally"
leaving the stove on,

20:51.005 --> 20:52.705
you can survive this.

20:52.792 --> 20:55.318
I've got to go now,
Mr. Trump,

20:55.406 --> 20:59.193
but next time conservatives are
getting made fun of real bad,

20:59.281 --> 21:01.944
tell them my story.

21:02.301 --> 21:05.152
- B-e-e-e-e-e-e-ee...
- What kind of god would

21:05.240 --> 21:07.404
- B-e-e-e-e-e-e-ee...
- let a man be made fun of?!

21:07.492 --> 21:09.504
- E-e-e-ee...
- It should be me lying there!

21:09.592 --> 21:11.545
- B-e-e-e-e-e-e-ee...
- It looks so comfortable!

21:11.632 --> 21:14.375
- B-e-e-e-e-e-e-ee...
- Why is this loser in my bed?!

21:14.463 --> 21:16.834
- B-e-e-e-e-e-e-ee...
- I want the bed!

21:20.568 --> 21:24.021
Shit! Why did I only
get $800 in quarters?

21:24.654 --> 21:26.636
Whoa! Uh, huh?

21:26.724 --> 21:28.107
Thanks, Kimberly.
You...

21:28.195 --> 21:30.108
I didn't see you
at Fontainebleau.

21:30.196 --> 21:31.560
Sorry about that.

21:31.648 --> 21:34.886
Hey, do you think maybe I was
working through some stuff

21:34.974 --> 21:37.035
when I had Chuck and Nancy
re-birth me

21:37.123 --> 21:39.125
using couch cushions
as the birth canal?

21:39.212 --> 21:42.144
Don, when you let people in
like Chuck and Nancy,

21:42.232 --> 21:43.837
you allow them
to change who you are.

21:43.925 --> 21:45.804
Next thing you know,
you're acting like a baby

21:45.892 --> 21:47.191
instead of
the tough strong man

21:47.279 --> 21:49.290
who made two koalas
play Russian Roulette.

21:49.378 --> 21:52.017
- Yeah, I miss that guy.
- Me too.

21:52.105 --> 21:54.280
And that guy
can let me in,

21:54.368 --> 21:56.142
and I'll never try
to change him,

21:56.230 --> 21:59.473
even if his every decision
is a transparent cry for help.

21:59.561 --> 22:02.644
Cool. Now let's pour
some beer in my crack.

22:02.732 --> 22:07.272
No, Don, let's pour some beer
in our cracks.

22:10.220 --> 22:11.298
How's he doing?

22:11.386 --> 22:14.064
It was a close call,
but he's gonna be okay.

22:14.180 --> 22:16.311
Well, I better go.
I got my Sunday Night Live

22:16.399 --> 22:18.352
audition in the morning,
and I still haven't nailed

22:18.439 --> 22:20.181
Michelle Obama's accent.

22:20.310 --> 22:22.803
Ben. We can't
let this happen again.

22:22.922 --> 22:24.415
Next time,
it could be someone

22:24.502 --> 22:27.125
who has more than
zero contacts in his phone.

22:27.212 --> 22:29.410
But you were right. It's over.
The liberals won.

22:29.498 --> 22:32.152
MSNBC is like
the Fox News of TV.

22:32.296 --> 22:34.459
I thought I heard something
about a march.

22:34.547 --> 22:36.790
You think that's something
the president would be into?

22:36.878 --> 22:38.881
- Did you forget again?
- I did.

22:58.168 --> 22:59.295
are coming here to march,

22:59.382 --> 23:01.166
and I can't think of
one thing to tell them

23:01.254 --> 23:03.375

to get Port-a-Potties.

23:03.462 --> 23:07.058
Just tell them that, some day,

23:07.146 --> 23:09.658

a Confederate flag unitard

have gathered in Washington

24:04.882 --> 24:06.708
to fight for the rights
of Republicans

24:06.796 --> 24:08.039
or, said another way,

24:08.109 --> 24:10.631
the President has hosted
a white-power rally.

My fellow conservatives,
we have a dream,

24:34.365 --> 24:37.254
a dream that began
on a bridge in Selma

24:37.342 --> 24:39.505
though not the side people
typically think of...

24:39.593 --> 24:41.981
a dream that, one day,

24:42.141 --> 24:44.567
conservatives will be able
to go online

24:44.655 --> 24:48.738
without the fear of someone
teasing them a little bit!

24:49.114 --> 24:52.106
Wow.
What a fuckin' snowflake.

24:53.792 --> 24:55.917
Hey, you guys don't have
a permit for any of this.

24:56.005 --> 24:56.833
You gotta scram.

24:56.921 --> 24:59.473
Oh, why? Because
we're conservatives?

25:00.547 --> 25:02.479
No. Just, everyone
needs a permit.

25:02.567 --> 25:04.208
You don't get
special treatment.

It's not fair!

25:20.684 --> 25:22.624
We're allowed to be here!

25:22.712 --> 25:24.223
Mommy said so!

25:24.311 --> 25:26.974
You're a bad cop!
Bad cop!

25:27.132 --> 25:28.786
He is a bad cop!

25:28.881 --> 25:33.083
Let us stay, or I'm gonna cry,
and I'm gonna cry and cry!

25:33.481 --> 25:35.434
I hate you!

25:38.532 --> 25:40.473
Is that tears or piss?

25:41.583 --> 25:43.495
Ah.
It's just tears, thank God.

25:43.583 --> 25:44.973
Alright, stay.
Just wrap it up

25:45.061 --> 25:46.834
before the ceramics fair
sets up.

25:46.922 --> 25:48.528
- Yay!
- We did it!

25:48.616 --> 25:51.333
- Hooray!
- The right always wins!

25:53.142 --> 25:55.440
How are your hammies,
Mr. President?

25:55.528 --> 25:58.419
Pretty sore, but I'll just
take a month off work,

25:58.507 --> 26:00.510
wherever that is.

26:00.631 --> 26:02.414
You think
this changed anything?

26:02.502 --> 26:04.646
I'm about to find out.

26:04.978 --> 26:08.146
I'm on my way,
SoulCycle!

26:09.154 --> 26:11.213
Where'd you learn
to cry like that?

26:11.301 --> 26:14.035
Let's just say a couple
kooky cats taught me

26:14.123 --> 26:15.451
how to be vulnerable.

26:15.571 --> 26:19.490
Great news! Before I burnt
down O'Shittery's Beer Dump,

26:19.578 --> 26:21.651
I stole a bunch of kegs
from the loading dock.

26:21.745 --> 26:23.451
- Wanna go drink them?
- Uh,

26:23.539 --> 26:25.451
- Yeah, I think... w-we're alright, though.
- yeah, we're okay.

26:25.539 --> 26:27.175
You guys are huge dicks!

26:27.263 --> 26:31.491
I'm gonna start my own movement
against huge dicks!
