00:09.384 --> 00:11.636
So, are you asking
if I was surprised?

00:12.554 --> 00:13.513
I don't know.

00:15.890 --> 00:17.183
I mean, maybe I was.

00:22.397 --> 00:26.192
Look, you can think you know someone
because you've been through shit together.

00:27.318 --> 00:29.237
Or because you came up together.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.659
But to actually know
what's going on in a person's head,

00:35.994 --> 00:37.662
or in their heart, I mean…

00:39.873 --> 00:41.082
You can't know that.

00:42.584 --> 00:43.710
You can't.

00:46.254 --> 00:49.340
Like with me, I mean, people…
people think that they know me

00:49.424 --> 00:52.385
because I made them laugh
or because they've been to a show.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.433
But they don't know
what I did to get here.

00:59.851 --> 01:01.644
Or what it takes to stay here.

01:04.856 --> 01:06.733
When a person's back is against the wall,

01:06.816 --> 01:09.986
and they gotta do whatever they can
to keep from losing what they got…

01:14.699 --> 01:16.910
that's when you get to see
who a person is.

01:19.537 --> 01:21.164
Or what they're capable of.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.752
You know <i>that </i>about someone…

01:27.212 --> 01:28.379
Well, then, maybe…

01:30.590 --> 01:32.801
maybe then you can say that you know 'em.

01:34.469 --> 01:35.595
But then again,

01:36.471 --> 01:37.680
you know <i>that…</i>

01:42.936 --> 01:44.604
maybe you wouldn't want to.

01:52.237 --> 01:55.406
<i>Let's get ready to rumble!</i>

02:03.623 --> 02:06.501


02:06.584 --> 02:08.711
-Right this way, Kid.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.630
<i>Our first guest</i>
<i>is one of my favorites.</i>

02:10.713 --> 02:12.799
<i>-He's been here many times before.</i>

02:12.882 --> 02:16.219
<i>His new film </i>The Anti-verse
<i>is playing in theaters now</i>

02:16.302 --> 02:20.598
<i>and about to cross</i>
<i>one billion dollars at the box office.</i>

02:20.682 --> 02:22.767


02:22.851 --> 02:26.896
<i>This weekend, he'll be headed back</i>
<i>to his hometown, Philadelphia,</i>

02:27.730 --> 02:29.899
<i>yeah, the City of Brotherly Love,</i>

02:30.859 --> 02:34.612
<i>for the start of his worldwide</i>
<i>comedy tour, "What Did I Tell You?"</i>

02:36.072 --> 02:37.615
<i>We're so lucky to have him here…</i>

02:38.950 --> 02:41.327
<i>…and I'm proud to call him a friend.</i>

02:41.411 --> 02:45.165
<i>Comedy star, TV star,</i>
<i>movie star, entrepreneur, mogul,</i>

02:45.248 --> 02:48.334
<i>philanthropist, dreamboat.</i>

02:49.627 --> 02:51.838
<i>Let's give a warm welcome for…</i>

02:56.176 --> 02:57.385
The Kid.

03:03.099 --> 03:05.018
Thank you. Thank you.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.691
And then we saw S<i>tolen Money.</i>
My wife and I couldn't stop laughing.

03:11.774 --> 03:13.735
We stayed in the theater
and watched it twice.

03:13.818 --> 03:15.069
Oh, I wrote that.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.197
And you know what, Kid?

03:17.280 --> 03:20.491
I cried the second time too.
The stuff with that little kid.

03:20.575 --> 03:23.578
Thank you. I appreciate you, man.

03:23.661 --> 03:27.248
We're gonna, uh, take off.
If you need anything, just ask.

03:27.373 --> 03:30.293
Oh! Uh, when we
get over Houston, let me know.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.295
Maybe open the plane?
I wanna throw some shit out.

03:32.378 --> 03:33.588
He's talking about me.

03:33.671 --> 03:34.797
-I can't.
-No?

03:34.881 --> 03:37.383
-It's illegal to open it.
-It's illegal.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.677
I know that, I was joking.
I'm fucking with you.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.934
-Morning, Herschel. Morning, Billie.
-Morning.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.101
I see I was right,

03:47.185 --> 03:50.772
that everyone here is in first except
for the person who makes Kid funnier.

03:50.855 --> 03:52.023
-Todd.
-Okay. So…

03:52.106 --> 03:55.068
Once you make him hilarious,
you get to come in first class.

03:55.151 --> 03:56.444
That's the team rule.

03:59.364 --> 04:00.782
How did <i>Ellen </i>go this morning?

04:00.865 --> 04:03.326
-Same as always. I've done it 20 times.
-She loves you.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.078
Nothing's different. It was great.

04:05.161 --> 04:07.163
I, uh,
I have something to tell you, guys.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.624
-Um, I got this offer, um--
-Excuse me?

04:10.583 --> 04:11.918
That's not your seat, is it?

04:14.045 --> 04:16.589
Oh, shit. How the fuck do you know?

04:16.673 --> 04:20.468
Okay. Okay, I'm gonna go,
but you guys have fun here.

04:20.551 --> 04:23.179
We're talking about jokes.
If a joke was a person…

04:23.263 --> 04:24.389
You look great.

04:24.472 --> 04:27.517
-See you, Billie, on the ground.
-You're so mean today.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.727
-So mean today.
-Don't cross her.

04:31.145 --> 04:32.272
Holy shit.

04:33.439 --> 04:34.315
Hey.

04:34.399 --> 04:35.775
Hey, man, it's you!

04:37.360 --> 04:38.444
Oh. Oh!

04:38.528 --> 04:41.072
Now I get it. Bodyguard, right? Right?

04:41.155 --> 04:42.949
-He's with me.

04:43.032 --> 04:44.367
You're from Philly.

04:45.952 --> 04:49.622
I remember seeing you
at the Laff House back in college.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.624
Know what the funniest bit
you ever did was?

04:51.708 --> 04:54.252
The 50 different meanings
when Black folks say "nigga."

04:54.335 --> 04:55.211
Oh!

04:55.712 --> 04:57.672
Funny. So funny.

04:57.755 --> 04:59.424
"Nigga!"

04:59.507 --> 05:01.217
"Nigga!"

05:01.301 --> 05:03.261
Look here, man, you might wanna sit down.

05:03.344 --> 05:04.721
Whoa. Hey. Hey.

05:04.804 --> 05:07.765
Chill out, Hersch. Chill out. He's a fan.

05:08.516 --> 05:11.936
He's an excited fan, but he's still a fan.
You know that girl that was just here?

05:12.520 --> 05:15.064
Who you was talking to? She's responsible
for that. She wrote that.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.357
So funny.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.942
I'll be sure to send your love.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.737
But I think the way
you just delivered it was aggressive.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.323
That was a lot. I get it,
you're trying to make an impression.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.325
So I just want you to know that you did.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.243
-You made one.
-Thank you.

05:28.619 --> 05:29.579
You can relax.

05:29.662 --> 05:32.457
Oh, my God, I said "ah" not "er."

05:32.540 --> 05:34.917
-There's a difference, right, Kid?
-No.

05:35.001 --> 05:38.671
No, there's actually not a difference.
Why don't you just relax?

05:41.215 --> 05:43.009
You're flying commercial, huh?

05:43.092 --> 05:45.303
-If I had your money, I'd fly private--
-Dude.

05:45.386 --> 05:48.222
It's time to take your seat,
we're about to take off. Have a seat.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.391
Oh, you're the manager? Oh…

05:50.475 --> 05:52.310
Right. Right, right, right, right.

05:52.393 --> 05:54.729
-Sir, can you take your seat?
-Absolutely.

05:55.646 --> 05:58.733
-You tell jokes, he keeps you rich, right?
-Have a good flight, sir.

06:01.861 --> 06:02.779
It's unreal.

06:03.529 --> 06:04.530
It's unreal.

06:06.115 --> 06:08.159
Fuck. My phone dead. You got a charger?

06:08.242 --> 06:10.620
Uh, I need my chargers on this.
I'm sorry, I'm working.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.789
I could text the hotel,
they'll have one waiting.

06:12.872 --> 06:13.706
-Hersch.
-Yeah.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.084
-Todd's useless, got a charger?
-Yeah, let me check, boss.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.293
Hey.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.753
You can use mine, bro.

06:18.836 --> 06:20.463
Just remember to give it back.

06:20.546 --> 06:23.466
Not that I don't trust you,
I mean… you're you.

06:24.467 --> 06:27.178
-I'm a nigga.
-Yeah. You're my nigga!

06:27.261 --> 06:29.347
I'm two seconds
from knocking you the fuck you out.

06:29.430 --> 06:31.849
-Hersch, goddamn, Hersch, please.
-You hear me?

06:31.933 --> 06:34.227
What we gonna gain? We'd be
in jail soon as we get off the plane.

06:34.310 --> 06:35.144
Let that man live.

06:35.728 --> 06:38.898
"
by MFSB playing]

06:58.418 --> 07:00.086
-Hey, Kid! Kid!

07:00.711 --> 07:02.380
Good to see you after all this time.

07:02.463 --> 07:04.841
-How you doing? What's up, Gene?
-It's Gene. Yeah!

07:04.924 --> 07:06.092
I remember you.

07:06.175 --> 07:08.177
-Hey! I'm good.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.805
-Now that you're on tour, I'm great.
-Nice.

07:10.888 --> 07:13.266
Congrats on <i>The Anti-verse</i>
almost hitting a billion.

07:13.349 --> 07:15.601
I've seen it like five times.
-Thank you. Thank you.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.358
In here, we will find
our presidential suite.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.237
There are two bedrooms.
This is the master.

07:27.488 --> 07:29.657
-Where they got you?
-I'm in earshot down the hall.

07:30.783 --> 07:33.161
-I'ma jump on this call. You good?
-Yeah, I'm straight.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.121
-All right. In a minute.
-In a minute.

07:35.204 --> 07:37.748
Would you like me to demonstrate
the bedroom lighting scheme?

07:37.832 --> 07:39.459
It's really quite complex.

07:40.543 --> 07:41.627
No.

07:41.711 --> 07:42.753
Um…

07:44.797 --> 07:47.383
Let me…
Let me see what the other room look like.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.343
Just in case I mess this one up.

07:51.429 --> 07:52.638
Uh…

07:52.763 --> 07:56.601
Apologies.
This is not standard to be so dark.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.526
There you go, that's much--

08:05.610 --> 08:06.819
What the fuck is this?

08:06.903 --> 08:08.613
What the fuck is this, man?

08:08.696 --> 08:10.948
-What is this, man? Come on!
-I don't know. I'm sorry.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.075
-You're sorry?
-Must be some sort of practical joke.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.368
On who? Who's the joke on?

08:14.452 --> 08:16.245
-Is it on me or you?
-I don't know.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.539
-I don't think it's funny. Do you--
-What the fuck?

08:19.123 --> 08:20.666
What the fuck y'all doing in here?

08:20.750 --> 08:22.293
-Who the fuck are you?
-Who the fuck are <i>you</i>?

08:22.376 --> 08:24.879
-Why the fuck are you in my room?
-Why the fuck are you in <i>my </i>room?

08:24.962 --> 08:26.881
-Is this real?
-We don't need to--

08:26.964 --> 08:29.383
-What the fuck you doing in here?
-Is he with you?

08:29.467 --> 08:32.303
-No.
-Then that means that you're with me.

08:32.386 --> 08:34.305
He comes close, we fuck him up.

08:34.388 --> 08:35.973
-Oh, fuck me up?
-"Fuck him up"?

08:36.057 --> 08:38.434
-We fuck him up. Bottom line.
-I don't know…

08:38.518 --> 08:40.770
-I don't think I can fuck him up.
-Man, this street shit!

08:40.853 --> 08:42.813
I did eight years for murder,
I ain't scared.

08:42.897 --> 08:45.274
This ain't got shit to do
with you and your jail time.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.401
You gonna show me up in front of my lady?

08:47.485 --> 08:49.612
You goddamn right.
Listen to me! Hey!

08:49.695 --> 08:51.239
Hey, man! Street shit!

08:51.322 --> 08:53.491
-Come on with it, I dare you.
-We jumpin' him.

08:53.574 --> 08:55.243
-On fucking three.
-I dare ya.

08:55.326 --> 08:56.702
-One. Two.
-Let's go!

08:56.786 --> 08:58.204
-Huh?
-Ditmar, let's go! Three!

08:58.287 --> 08:59.330
Let's go, Ditmar!

09:01.499 --> 09:03.000
Please. Please. Please.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.210
What's up, Carlton?

09:04.752 --> 09:06.170
-Yo, what's up?
-What's up, brother?

09:06.254 --> 09:08.297
-What's up? What's up?
-My brother, he's staying here.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.757
-We're fucking with you.
-I see.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.843
-He does this type of shit.
-Me and my girl are fucking with you.

09:12.927 --> 09:16.430
In that case, a warm welcome
to the Four Seasons Philadelphia.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.766
Yeah, yeah. A warm welcome to you too.

09:20.851 --> 09:23.312
Man, the blow-up doll?

09:23.896 --> 09:25.356
That's a new touch.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.275
-Yeah, brother.
-Oh, God.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.777
Almost lost a lung
trying to blow that motherfucker up.

09:30.945 --> 09:34.198
Hey, do you know that they put
the room rate on the walls here?

09:34.699 --> 09:36.033
$5,000 a night.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.911
I don't have to pay that.
I ain't paid for a room in years.

09:38.995 --> 09:42.540
Maybe they put it up there so they
can let people know this is the shit

09:42.623 --> 09:45.209
most regular motherfuckers cannot afford.

09:45.293 --> 09:48.629
You do know they're not giving me
the room, though, C. I'm working for it.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.047
I ain't say you wasn't, bro.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.841
Don't get sensitive, man.

09:53.175 --> 09:56.137
How about this, C?
I'm happy to see you, man.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.972
I'm happy to see you too, man.

09:58.472 --> 09:59.807
Coming up and everything.

09:59.890 --> 10:02.184
-Yes, sir.
-On your grind.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.270
-On tour.
-Yes, sir.

10:04.353 --> 10:06.772
Got the kiddie movie
coming out, going big.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.650
It's not a kiddie movie, C.
It's a superhero movie.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.777
A superhero movie
that's almost at a billion dollars.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.821
Wow, dude, I ain't see it, man.

10:13.904 --> 10:17.033
I was gonna see it, though,
but not really my thing. You know?

10:17.700 --> 10:19.785
It's not your thing
but you know it's a kiddie movie?

10:19.869 --> 10:22.663
Gotta be a kiddie movie,
your movies don't make a billion dollars.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.458
Yeah, kiddie movie.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.252
So, uh, Christian like it?

10:29.128 --> 10:31.505
Christian likes everything I do.

10:31.589 --> 10:34.800
Really? I mean, maybe
he's just saying that to be nice.

10:35.384 --> 10:37.011
Why would my son lie to me?

10:38.679 --> 10:42.016
All right, how about this. Whether
you saw it, didn't see it, like it,

10:42.516 --> 10:43.934
didn't like it, it doesn't matter.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.729
The studio wants to give me
$25 million to do another one.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.481
-Whoo. Damn.
-Somewhere somebody likes it.

10:48.564 --> 10:49.732
Oh, yeah.

10:49.815 --> 10:52.151
Yeah, well, that's good,
they definitely do that.

10:52.234 --> 10:53.861
'Cause kiddies love that shit.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.031
Is that the third or fourth "kiddies"?

10:57.615 --> 10:59.700
-Mm.
-Can't keep track at this point.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.162
I'm sorry about the restaurant.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.165
We ain't dead yet, man.

11:08.250 --> 11:11.253
Just gotta work some things out.
We ain't dead.

11:13.756 --> 11:17.176
-I still got the liquor license, though.
-But you got no restaurant.

11:17.259 --> 11:20.137
But as long as I got the liquor license,
I can come back.

11:20.221 --> 11:23.599
A liquor license means nothing
without the restaurant.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.393
What are you in, 1.3 mil now?

11:25.976 --> 11:26.936
It's over.

11:27.019 --> 11:30.606
No. Nah. it ain't over. I know we in deep,
but, you know, look, bro.

11:31.232 --> 11:33.859
The liquor license is non-transferable.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.362
That's, like, 400, 500K, man.

11:36.445 --> 11:37.905
Yo, we're good.

11:37.988 --> 11:39.740
Terry told me you asked for $600,000.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.867
-Terry got an attitude, man!
-Cut the shit, man.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.619
-Terry got an attitude!
-Man, stop.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.538
-I wanted to check that mother--
-Stop. Stop.

11:46.497 --> 11:48.082
Six hundred thousand dollars, C?

11:48.165 --> 11:51.419
Look, look, look.
It takes money to make money, right?

11:51.502 --> 11:52.336
You know that.

11:53.462 --> 11:54.797
When have you made money?

11:57.216 --> 11:59.093
Tell me when you've made money.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.054
You had the car wash.

12:02.763 --> 12:04.390
After, you had the check-cashing place,

12:04.473 --> 12:05.850
but that kept getting robbed.

12:05.933 --> 12:09.145
Now we're at a restaurant.
At this point, it's not about the money.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.397
Hey. Hey, I know, man.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.482
I know I done fucked up some shit.

12:14.024 --> 12:16.360
I ain't trying to be, like,
the burden all the time.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.279
Tell you what. Let's not do it.

12:18.362 --> 12:21.782
I just got here, just checked in, I see
my older brother. I don't wanna do this.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.242
-Yeah.
-Let's have a good time.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.953
-Yeah. That's right. Yeah.
-Right?

12:26.036 --> 12:28.414
All the boys, all your
whole crew gonna be there tonight.

12:28.497 --> 12:30.583
-Now… Now we're talking.
-Mm-hmm.

12:30.666 --> 12:32.960
The whole crew? Is Gus gonna be there?

12:33.544 --> 12:37.256
I ain't seen Gus in the longest time, man.
I miss Gus. Talking shit.

12:37.339 --> 12:39.508
-Gus not gonna be there, man.
-Why?

12:39.592 --> 12:40.760
Gus dead, man.

12:40.843 --> 12:43.179
What the fuck you mean, Gus died? What?

12:43.929 --> 12:46.140
Nobody tell me Gus died.
Why didn't you tell Gus died?

12:46.974 --> 12:48.184
'Cause Gus ain't dead!

12:52.563 --> 12:55.274
-Yes. Yes, good one.
-Every now and then, right?

12:55.357 --> 12:58.068
I told you to get dressed.
This what you're wearing tonight?

12:58.152 --> 13:00.446
-Yeah. What's wrong with this?
-That's what you're wearing.

13:00.529 --> 13:02.615
-Want me to double breast it?
-No, no, no. You do you.

13:02.698 --> 13:04.116
That's your vibe, not mine.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.702
I'ma go get dressed.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.871
Uh… I'll be out in a little bit.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.290
-We're gonna have a good time tonight.
-Yeah.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.585
Shit.

13:16.462 --> 13:19.423
<i>Seemed he was starting</i>
<i>to get comfortable with us being apart.</i>

13:19.507 --> 13:22.343
<i>Seems so,</i>
<i>but he wants to come see you on the road.</i>

13:22.426 --> 13:25.721
I would love that. I don't know
how I would make that work.

13:25.805 --> 13:29.099
I don't want him to think that I'm not
focused on him, you know what I mean,

13:29.183 --> 13:30.726
and… and his needs.

13:30.810 --> 13:34.355
With you being a baby momma now,
I gotta up the ante on my presence.

13:34.438 --> 13:37.983
Ha ha. And the award
<i>for best divorced couple goes to…</i>

13:38.526 --> 13:41.487
Look, if it can be done,
we're gonna do it at a very high level.

13:41.570 --> 13:44.907
Uh, I need your opinion on something.
What do you think about this joke?

13:44.990 --> 13:47.076
"My son's friends
really do think I'm a superhero,

13:47.159 --> 13:49.161
and now those little fuckers
wanna fight me."

13:49.662 --> 13:51.580
<i>Mmm… Nah.</i>

13:51.664 --> 13:52.998
Let me give it a little punch.

13:53.082 --> 13:56.377
"My son's friends
really think I'm a superhero and now…"

13:56.460 --> 13:58.087
Yeah, no, fuck it.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.797
It's stupid, I'll throw it away.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.424
All right, I gotta go.
Tell Christian I love him. I miss him.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.927
He's my everything.
All of the above. Okay?

14:05.010 --> 14:05.970
<i>I will.</i>

14:06.053 --> 14:07.513
<i>-Hey.</i>
Yo.

14:07.596 --> 14:08.722
<i>Are you nervous?</i>

14:08.806 --> 14:11.267
<i>It's the first time</i>
<i>you've been out in quite a while.</i>

14:11.350 --> 14:14.895
I ask for your opinion on a joke,
and you take that as me being nervous?

14:14.979 --> 14:16.772
Concerts don't make me nervous.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.692
Now, am I annoyed?
That would've been a better question.

14:19.775 --> 14:22.862
That, I am.
Doing damage control with Carlton.

14:22.945 --> 14:24.738
Yo, Kid, we gotta make soundcheck!

14:24.822 --> 14:27.241
All right, gimme two minutes, Hersch.
Here I come.

14:27.324 --> 14:31.287
-I'm serious, I gotta go, Mo. All right?
<i>-Good luck, and baby needs some new shoes!</i>

14:31.370 --> 14:35.624
Baby has a $17 million house,
so baby can kiss my ass. Bye.

14:36.917 --> 14:40.129
All right, believe it or not,
y'all, that's my time, Philly!

14:40.212 --> 14:42.381
You already know who's coming up next!

14:42.464 --> 14:45.301
One of the funniest
motherfuckers in the business.

14:45.384 --> 14:48.429
I'm talking about
billions of dollars in the movies.

14:48.512 --> 14:52.349
Showcases. Comedy showcases.
This nigga done been all around the world.

14:52.433 --> 14:55.769
-All right. Showtime.
-Showtime, baby, showtime.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.772
Y'all know how we do,
we go to bring it in.

14:58.856 --> 15:00.608
-Let's get this prayer in.
-Yes, sir.

15:00.691 --> 15:03.527
Here we go. All right, dear Lord,

15:03.611 --> 15:06.322
let these jokes be funny
and the reviews be good. Amen!

15:06.405 --> 15:09.325
-Amen to that, the reviews are good.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.493
The reviews are always good. Okay?

15:11.577 --> 15:13.203
-Go get it!
-Yes, sir.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.081
-I want seconds!
-They're ready?

15:16.165 --> 15:17.750
-They're ready.
-My guy!

15:17.833 --> 15:21.337
All right, you motherfuckers ready
to have a good time tonight?

15:22.504 --> 15:24.506
Wassup, Philly?

15:26.050 --> 15:27.968
Y'all ready to have a good time tonight?

15:28.052 --> 15:30.012
That's not good enough,
I can't hear y'all.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.264
I said, y'all ready
to have a good time tonight?

15:36.727 --> 15:38.938
-Fucking unbelievable!
-Dude, it felt so good.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.106
-It did? That was like… Ah!
-So good.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.193
-So good.
-So good.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.445
Your brother and his crew,
they're backstage.

15:46.528 --> 15:48.781
-I gave 'em a wave, they're in the corner.
-Okay.

15:48.864 --> 15:51.909
Okay. Let me just put this
in your head real quick, okay?

15:51.992 --> 15:54.036
This is when Carlton
starts to become Carlton.

15:54.119 --> 15:56.830
VIP room wasn't good enough,
so I made him a V-VIP room.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.666
I don't know what that is. I made that up.

15:58.749 --> 16:02.169
I watch you take baby steps with him,
you don't take them with other people.

16:02.252 --> 16:04.129
Todd, just leave it the fuck alone, man.

16:04.755 --> 16:07.633
-Please, just leave it alone.

16:07.716 --> 16:09.802
I know how to deal with <i>my</i> brother.

16:10.719 --> 16:12.846
-I do.
-Yes, you do. Okay.

16:12.930 --> 16:15.516
I know this Black family politics thing
is tough for you.

16:15.599 --> 16:18.018
You're talking to a Jew from Texas.
I know crazy families.

16:18.102 --> 16:20.145
Let me do the bits, Todd.

16:20.229 --> 16:22.356
-On a serious note, look, for me.
-You don't have to--

16:22.439 --> 16:23.440
-No.
-Okay.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.733
Eye to eye.

16:25.234 --> 16:29.405
I promise you Carlton will no longer
fuck up my life after tonight.

16:29.488 --> 16:30.906
-All right?
-Thank you.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.076
-I love you, man.
-I love you back.

16:34.159 --> 16:34.994
Hey…

16:35.077 --> 16:36.495
I'll be out there with them.

16:40.958 --> 16:43.460
Hey, Todd,
why did he cut all my jokes tonight?

16:44.461 --> 16:47.131
Why do you act like it's the first time?
Just go with the flow.

16:47.214 --> 16:48.716
Yeah, I might have a different flow.

16:52.761 --> 16:54.179
Okay, what? Clarify.

16:54.263 --> 16:56.390
It's what I was
trying to tell you on the plane.

16:56.473 --> 16:58.684
I'm not gonna keep writing
discarded material.

16:58.767 --> 17:01.437
Not when I have a new job offer
I could be focusing on.

17:01.520 --> 17:05.357
-Oh. Okay. What's the new job offer?
-Writing a script for Will Ferrell.

17:05.441 --> 17:06.275
A-ha.

17:06.358 --> 17:09.403
He read one of my scripts, he dug it,
and wants me to do one for him.

17:09.486 --> 17:10.446
Okay.

17:10.529 --> 17:13.073
I just… I feel like I need to tell Kid.

17:13.657 --> 17:14.908
That you're leaving the show?

17:14.992 --> 17:17.995
If he's not using my material,
then what am I doing here?

17:18.078 --> 17:19.913
Yeah, sorry, you can't leave. No.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.832
Because I'm so valuable to him?

17:21.915 --> 17:23.375
Like, he just needs my jokes so much?

17:23.459 --> 17:25.836
Billie, it's not just the jokes.
It's the banter.

17:25.919 --> 17:28.172
Your presence.
It's like we're a little family.

17:28.255 --> 17:30.591
It's the way you give him shit,
makes him feel normal.

17:30.674 --> 17:32.384
And it keeps you paid.

17:32.468 --> 17:33.594
Very, very well.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.097
-Can I give you a piece of advice?
-Sure.

17:37.181 --> 17:40.142
If you tell me to chill out or have
a drink, I'm gonna poke out your eyes.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.393
You can do both these things.

17:41.477 --> 17:44.521
Take the job, keep your mouth shut
about it, keep fighting for your jokes.

17:46.273 --> 17:47.191
Okay.

17:47.691 --> 17:50.360
Yeah. Okay.
But only if he knows I'm doing both.

17:50.861 --> 17:53.113
Okay. But you let me
figure out when to tell him.

17:53.197 --> 17:54.156
Of course.

17:54.698 --> 17:55.991
-Have a good night.
-Thanks.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.826
-Congratulations.
-Yeah.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.457
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

18:04.208 --> 18:05.834
-What up, champ?
-What's up, man?

18:06.335 --> 18:07.878
-Nice.
-Yo.

18:07.961 --> 18:09.671
My guy. Appreciate you.

18:09.755 --> 18:10.756
Hey. Wassup, man?

18:10.839 --> 18:11.965
-Chilling.
-All right?

18:12.049 --> 18:13.926
Enjoyed the show. I'm glad. I'm glad.

18:21.266 --> 18:22.101
Here we go.

18:22.851 --> 18:23.685
Come on.

18:25.145 --> 18:27.439
You! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.942
-Hey!

18:30.025 --> 18:31.944
What's up? What's up, man?

18:32.027 --> 18:34.571
-Wassup! It's good to see you.
-Long time, man!

18:34.655 --> 18:37.199
-Good to see you. Gus!
-My brother!

18:38.659 --> 18:40.536
-Now, right here been a minute!
-Goddamn!

18:40.619 --> 18:42.329
-Man!
-How y'all doing, man?

18:42.412 --> 18:45.124
-Not as good as you. Better than Carlton.
-Stop it.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.543
-Come on. Come on.
-Whatever, man, whatever.

18:47.626 --> 18:50.003
Okay, so what we into? What we into?

18:50.087 --> 18:51.964
What you mean?
You know we gonna hit the club.

18:52.047 --> 18:55.676
-I know you rolling, right, superstar?
-The club? With y'all suckers?

18:55.759 --> 18:59.179
No. My brother knows how to remove
himself from the scene of the crime.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.392
And, plus, he's got
his chaperone over there.

19:03.475 --> 19:04.309
Yeah.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.603
-This is weird for you?
-Look how serious he is.

19:06.687 --> 19:07.855
Say no more. Say no more.

19:07.938 --> 19:11.150
I'm not here to put
a weird vibe in here with my guys.

19:11.233 --> 19:14.111
Hey, just gimme a sec, man.
My guy. Thank you.

19:14.194 --> 19:16.989
Okay, is that better?
That better? Are we good?

19:17.072 --> 19:20.033
You need some drinks for that.
I'm on drinks. Let's do this.

19:20.117 --> 19:22.244
Yeah, man, come on. Let's do it.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.662
-Drinks? Drinks?
-Or shots?

19:24.413 --> 19:26.456
-Yeah, that top-shelf vodka.
-Yeah.

19:26.540 --> 19:27.791
Get the vodka on that.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.001
-Hey,
-Yeah.

19:29.084 --> 19:32.671
Real quick, between us, you know
I'm not really trying to drink like that.

19:32.754 --> 19:33.922
I'm six months sober.

19:34.006 --> 19:37.342
Oh, right. As many times
as you done fell off, I forgot.

19:37.426 --> 19:41.221
Yeah, but we can't celebrate without you.
Come on, just a little sip, man.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.973
Just a little sip.

19:43.056 --> 19:46.768
All right. Yeah, this is a toast
to my little brother.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.479
-Always got my back.
-There it is.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.023
-There it is.
-Yes, sir.

19:51.106 --> 19:52.024
My man.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.280
Oh yeah.

19:59.114 --> 20:00.657
Fill 'em up! Fill 'em up!

20:02.784 --> 20:04.661
You know how we do, back-to-back.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.371
-That's right.
-Back-to-back.

20:07.164 --> 20:09.541
-There it is, that's my man!
-Whoa!

20:09.625 --> 20:12.753
What's good, man? Go ahead,
finish that up, man. Quit playin'.

20:12.836 --> 20:15.547
You want us to put a nipple on it?
Come on, man. Drink it.

20:16.423 --> 20:18.717
We could add some salt,
baby bottle, finish that.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.177
Let's go! Get on the level!

20:20.260 --> 20:22.262
-Let's get it.
-Down the hatch with us.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.141
-Hmm? Whoo!

20:29.728 --> 20:32.940
-There he is! My man.
-That's what I'm talking about, boy!

20:33.023 --> 20:35.234
-Yeah! How we used to do!
-We gonna have some fun.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.569
Look, excuse me a second.

20:38.278 --> 20:40.197
Oh, okay. Okay.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.032
Yo, there you go.

20:42.658 --> 20:43.992
Wait, hold, hold up.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.161
We went to see
your latest movie the other day.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.913
We missed half the jokes

20:47.996 --> 20:51.166
'cause C was in there
laughing his ass off.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.543
-Carlton was doing that? Ah.
-Yeah, Carlton.

20:54.461 --> 20:56.880
Wait, he… he didn't tell you he saw it?

20:56.964 --> 20:58.799
Wait, why do you say that?

20:58.882 --> 21:02.344
No, man. He told me,
he said y'all went, had a good time.

21:02.427 --> 21:03.553
He said it was love.

21:03.637 --> 21:05.973
-Yeah, man. It was off the chain.
-Yes, sir.

21:06.598 --> 21:08.141
-Proud of you.
-Stop it, man.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.227
-Don't know what this means to me.
-Come a long way.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.815
I wanna introduce you
to some of my friends.

21:14.898 --> 21:18.110
Thank y'all for coming out tonight.
Much appreciated.

21:18.193 --> 21:20.988
We don't need a club,
I just made one for you right here, baby.

21:22.489 --> 21:24.825
That's right. Ladies, ladies,
you know who this is, right?

21:24.908 --> 21:27.452
-Yeah, we do.
-Go ahead. Introduce yourselves.

21:27.536 --> 21:28.912
Can I take a picture with you?

21:29.788 --> 21:31.999
-Yeah? Thank you.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:35.252 --> 21:37.504
Ah, I love it. Thank you.

21:38.755 --> 21:39.881
Sorry, that was…

21:43.051 --> 21:45.804
One shot this time. Just one?

21:54.104 --> 21:55.731
-Okay.
-Go.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.232
-Okay.
-Another one.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.318
-Another one, damn. Hold on.
-Yeah.

22:00.277 --> 22:02.404
-There it is.
-Mmm.

22:03.530 --> 22:04.364
So?

22:04.448 --> 22:07.951
It's insane. I can't believe
you got me drinking like this. Shit.

22:08.869 --> 22:11.288
-You're cool. Gimme a second please.
-Okay.

22:11.371 --> 22:12.664
All right. Hey.

22:13.415 --> 22:15.334
I gotta get the fuck outta here.

22:16.209 --> 22:19.004
-You already took a sip, man.
-No. Come on.

22:19.087 --> 22:20.964
Listen, I ain't been this bad in a minute.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.425
I've been… I've been dry for a while.

22:23.508 --> 22:26.219
We gonna keep this shit
between us, all right? All right?

22:26.303 --> 22:30.265
-Besides, I need a wingman.
-You need a wingman?

22:30.349 --> 22:33.602
Yeah, I need a wingman, man.
You can't leave. You gotta stay.

22:35.103 --> 22:36.688
You want me to stay, I'll stay.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.775
But I ain't staying all night.
I ain't doing that.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.693
Not all night. I'll stay for a little bit.

22:41.777 --> 22:42.652
Man.

22:43.236 --> 22:44.237
I love you, man.

22:46.031 --> 22:48.367
-Don't, I love you, man.
-I love you too.

22:48.450 --> 22:49.326
And, and…

22:50.077 --> 22:53.372
I didn't mean to let you down.
I'm sorry about that.

22:53.455 --> 22:55.665
All of it. All of it.

22:59.002 --> 23:02.422
Hey, maybe tomorrow
we can talk about the money?

23:03.757 --> 23:05.884
I mean, I can save this restaurant, man.

23:06.927 --> 23:08.887
Listen, I hear what you're saying.

23:10.097 --> 23:14.142
But you… you gotta listen to me too,
though, right?

23:14.226 --> 23:15.560
You ain't let me down.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.897
When you let me down?
I ain't never say you let me down.

23:18.980 --> 23:20.232
You keep saying that.

23:20.315 --> 23:21.274
Love.

23:21.358 --> 23:23.902
But you keep saying you <i>need</i> it.

23:23.985 --> 23:25.237
"I need it."

23:25.862 --> 23:27.656
You don't need it. You want it.

23:27.739 --> 23:30.951
It's a big difference between
what you need and what you want.

23:31.660 --> 23:35.080
Maybe this whole thing that happened
and this shit happened for a reason.

23:36.164 --> 23:39.334
It happened to show you.
You know what I mean?

23:39.418 --> 23:42.963
To… to give you
a different look at this shit.

23:43.046 --> 23:46.091
Mm. Yeah, yeah.

23:46.174 --> 23:49.136
Yeah. But we're here
to celebrate you, all right?

23:49.219 --> 23:51.346
-We're celebrating me?
-We celebrate you.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.347
I like that.

23:53.140 --> 23:54.474
Hey, real quick.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.810
I know I'm your wingman,
but answer this question.

23:57.310 --> 23:58.311
Is she cute?

23:59.146 --> 24:01.815
-I think she cute.
-Yeah, she cute, man.

24:11.241 --> 24:13.952
K? K, wake up. Wake up, man.

24:14.035 --> 24:14.911
Wake up.

24:14.995 --> 24:17.247
Wake up. Wake up. Come on. Come on.

24:17.330 --> 24:19.082
Come on, come on, wake up.

24:19.166 --> 24:21.751
What the fuck you doing?
What do you mean, come on?

24:21.835 --> 24:23.295
Get out of my fucking room.

24:23.378 --> 24:25.922
-What the fuck are you doing? What?
-Just come on.

24:26.006 --> 24:28.967
What are you doing, man?
What the fuck are you doing? What?

24:29.050 --> 24:31.595
-What'd you take, K? What'd you take?
-I didn't take shit.

24:31.678 --> 24:34.055
-What did you give her?
-I ain't give nobody nothing.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.183
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-Shit.

24:36.266 --> 24:38.101
What are you-- What's the problem?

24:38.643 --> 24:40.729
-What's the fucking problem?
-We got a situation.

24:40.812 --> 24:42.606
-What situation?
-She dead.

24:43.607 --> 24:45.066
She dead, man.

24:50.697 --> 24:51.823
Fuck you mean, she dead?

24:51.907 --> 24:53.950
How you know she's not breathing?
Did you check her?

24:54.034 --> 24:56.161
Carlton, did you fucking check her?

24:57.204 --> 24:59.331
Oxy. The big ones.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.000
I'm calling a fucking ambulance.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.628
-I'm calling an ambulance!
-No.

25:04.711 --> 25:07.214
Let me call a fucking ambulance.
You just said she--

25:07.297 --> 25:11.009
If you call the ambulance,
they'll call the fucking cops.

25:11.092 --> 25:13.512
They'll call the fucking cops.

25:21.853 --> 25:23.230
<i>She got kids, man?</i>

25:23.313 --> 25:25.273
How the fuck
I know if she got kids?

25:27.734 --> 25:29.986
Did she take a picture of us
while we were there?

25:30.070 --> 25:31.446
Did people see her leave with us?

25:31.530 --> 25:34.533
People saw you leave here,
come in the fucking hotel.

25:34.616 --> 25:35.659
Of course they seen.

25:35.742 --> 25:39.621
Listen, I'm telling you, man.
Your next move better be a smart one.

25:40.121 --> 25:42.457
-I gotta get my phone, man.
-What the fuck you doing?

25:42.541 --> 25:44.417
-I gotta get my--
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:44.501 --> 25:47.587
You think this is some fucking DUI
or something like that?

25:47.671 --> 25:49.798
Some of that bullshit
you put up on Twitter?

25:49.881 --> 25:51.174
Dude, you got a body.

25:52.008 --> 25:54.511
I'm fully aware
of the fucking situation, man.

25:54.594 --> 25:57.222
But at least,
if I get my phone, I'll call Todd.

25:57.305 --> 26:01.226
Todd can come. Todd can help us
figure this shit the fuck out, man.

26:01.309 --> 26:03.186
No, no, no. You can't call your counselor

26:03.270 --> 26:05.772
and have this conversation
over the next fucking weeks.

26:05.855 --> 26:08.400
Dude, you got a dead woman
in your fucking bed.

26:09.025 --> 26:10.026
Next to you!

26:13.238 --> 26:14.281
Fuck.

26:20.495 --> 26:21.705
I fucked up.

26:22.998 --> 26:25.250
I fucked up, man.

26:25.333 --> 26:26.251
Shit.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.878
I got this. I'ma take care of this, man.

26:28.962 --> 26:31.590
What do you mean, you got this?
What do you mean?

26:31.673 --> 26:33.925
Do you understand
what the fuck is happening?

26:34.843 --> 26:39.931
Everything I worked hard for, everything
I bust my fucking ass for is over.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.350
It's a wrap, man.

26:42.434 --> 26:45.562
Throw that shit in the trash.
What the fuck I'ma say to Mo?

26:45.645 --> 26:48.773
How am I gonna explain
this shit to Christian?

26:50.066 --> 26:51.693
I need to call someone

26:51.776 --> 26:54.029
that can… that can help us

26:54.112 --> 26:56.948
and… and really help
figure this shit out.

26:57.032 --> 26:59.451
You need to shut the fuck up.
I told you I got this.

27:02.996 --> 27:04.456
What you gonna do, Carlton?

27:07.792 --> 27:08.877
All right.

27:16.509 --> 27:18.595
We gonna tell the cops
that she was with me.

27:19.471 --> 27:23.224
I was the one that brought her here,
you went in your room, we went in my room,

27:23.308 --> 27:26.353
and then, you know, she OD'ed in my room.

27:26.978 --> 27:28.980
You ain't know nothing about it.

27:29.064 --> 27:33.026
See, that way, like, if the cops gotta
arrest somebody, then they arrest me,

27:33.109 --> 27:35.904
and nobody gonna be suspicious
because I already got a jacket,

27:35.987 --> 27:37.238
you know what I mean?

27:38.114 --> 27:40.575
So, yeah.

27:41.284 --> 27:44.245
This way, we keep you out of it.

27:50.377 --> 27:51.711
That's your plan, C?

27:53.463 --> 27:54.422
Yeah.

27:59.844 --> 28:01.680
They not gonna let you own that.

28:02.722 --> 28:07.060
They would never let you own that,
even if the cops fucking believed you.

28:07.143 --> 28:08.812
The press is gonna spin it.

28:08.895 --> 28:10.980
"It's a dead girl in Kid's room."

28:11.064 --> 28:14.192
That's the headline.
That's what it's gonna say on CNN.

28:15.151 --> 28:18.238
-That's what it's gonna say on CNN.
-Okay, all right.

28:18.321 --> 28:20.115
You come up with a better plan, then.

28:25.453 --> 28:27.872
I shoulda just fucking did
what I was supposed to do, man.

28:27.956 --> 28:29.165
And what was that?

28:30.333 --> 28:31.751
Stay fucking sober.

28:33.211 --> 28:36.089
Be truthful, tell you it was time
to be better and do better.

28:36.756 --> 28:40.218
Forget the fucking restaurant,
man, let that shit go.

28:40.844 --> 28:45.390
I dropped the ball on all that.
I saw her, my gut said, "Get out, go."

28:45.473 --> 28:46.766
It said, "Get out of there."

28:46.850 --> 28:49.769
Yo, don't go confuse
your gut with your dick.

28:50.895 --> 28:54.482
Like I said,
you need to come up with a better plan,

28:54.566 --> 28:56.192
if you got one,

28:56.276 --> 28:58.987
'cause if you gonna do this bullshit,
leave me the fuck out of it.

29:05.827 --> 29:07.912
They're not gonna believe your plan, C.

29:07.996 --> 29:11.624
But I agree, I…
I can't tell Todd about this.

29:23.845 --> 29:25.138
There might be another way.

29:26.598 --> 29:29.225
-What does that mean?
-I'ma call somebody I know.

29:29.309 --> 29:30.602
You just-- What?

29:30.685 --> 29:33.354
-Whoa, whoa. Hold up.
-You just told me we can't call nobody.

29:33.438 --> 29:35.315
Now you saying let's call somebody?

29:35.398 --> 29:37.400
I'm gonna call
this Greek gangster dude, man.

29:37.484 --> 29:39.819
-He know how to handle this kind of shit.
-I don't know.

29:39.903 --> 29:41.780
-You don't know? You--
-I don't know.

29:43.198 --> 29:45.700
Listen, if you don't trust me,
just say it.

29:45.784 --> 29:48.119
You don't have faith in me, just say it.

29:48.912 --> 29:51.915
I mean, you the fuck
talking about you don't fucking know.

29:51.998 --> 29:54.918
Seven hours ago,
you the biggest motherfucker since Eddie.

29:55.001 --> 29:57.504
Now you're about to be
the most scandalous motherfucker.

29:57.587 --> 29:59.589
Your fans, you think
they go hear about this shit?

29:59.672 --> 30:02.050
They gonna get with this?
You don't need this, man.

30:02.133 --> 30:05.929
K, I'm telling you, you don't need this.
I got this. All right?

30:10.308 --> 30:13.144
Listen to me, you can't fuck this up.

30:14.354 --> 30:15.772
You can't.

30:16.773 --> 30:21.486
Like, you…
you cannot fuck me on this one, man.

30:21.569 --> 30:23.488
Like Mom always told us,

30:23.571 --> 30:25.698
good Lord ain't put
more on us than we can handle.

30:27.742 --> 30:28.743
Come on, man.

30:35.166 --> 30:37.085
So, what's this guy supposed to do?

30:39.754 --> 30:41.548
Look, the less you know, the better.

30:42.257 --> 30:44.634
Just stay cool.
He's gonna call up when he gets here.

30:50.098 --> 30:52.225
I thought you said
he was gonna call.

30:54.269 --> 30:55.311
Uh…

30:55.395 --> 30:57.981
-You gotta… You gotta get it, man.

30:58.106 --> 30:59.315
You gotta get the door.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.778
Yo, what's, what's up, Hersch?

31:03.862 --> 31:06.197
I wanted to check in on Kid
before I crash for the night.

31:06.281 --> 31:08.032
Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, he good, man.

31:08.116 --> 31:10.660
Him and old girl,
they hittin' it off back there.

31:10.743 --> 31:12.078
Yeah, it's all nice.

31:12.161 --> 31:14.706
Look, we're trying
to distance him from that stuff.

31:14.789 --> 31:16.541
Soon-to-be billion-dollar man and all.

31:17.500 --> 31:18.751
Look, uh…

31:20.295 --> 31:23.214
I got a little late-night snack here
I'm trying to...

31:23.298 --> 31:25.508
Trying to finish up right now,
you know what I'm saying?

31:25.592 --> 31:27.719
Alright, man, but he needs to be
up and out by 8:00.

31:27.802 --> 31:29.929
-Yeah. Eight o'clock.
-He got a screening to go to.

31:30.013 --> 31:32.515
Okay. Screening to go to.
Yeah. Yeah. All right.

31:32.599 --> 31:34.601
Good. Yeah.
Tell Todd that everything's cool.

31:34.684 --> 31:36.769
He and old girl hit it off.
He down for the night.

31:36.853 --> 31:39.772
-All right. Cool. Bye.
-Okay, yeah, bye. See you now.

31:39.856 --> 31:41.608
-It's eight o'clock
-Uh-huh. Eight o'clock.

31:43.067 --> 31:46.237
Suck ass. Scared me to fucking death.

31:46.821 --> 31:50.575
-Yo, what's this thing about a screening?
-Goddamn. Boys and Girls Club, man.

31:50.658 --> 31:52.452
They're screening <i>Anti-verse </i>today.

31:53.453 --> 31:54.412
Yeah.

32:00.793 --> 32:01.628
Yo.

32:03.004 --> 32:03.963
You're here?

32:04.464 --> 32:06.132
Okay, yeah, 1437.

32:07.342 --> 32:08.301
Solid.

32:09.677 --> 32:10.887
Okay, he's here.

32:15.892 --> 32:17.936
All right, all right,
so now the party's started.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.145
What's up, Carlton?

32:20.229 --> 32:21.522
Yo, anybody see you?

32:22.106 --> 32:24.776
Yeah, but they don't know
what I'm doing here, so fuck 'em.

32:26.069 --> 32:29.906
You know, all the time, you were
telling me that he was your brother.

32:29.989 --> 32:31.991
I thought it was a lie,
I didn't believe you,

32:32.075 --> 32:34.661
but now I get to meet him
because he killed somebody.

32:34.744 --> 32:36.371
He's got a weird sense of humor.

32:36.454 --> 32:39.624
K, this is Ari.
Ari, this is K, my brother.

32:39.707 --> 32:42.043
-Hey, Carlton's brother.
-I didn't kill nobody.

32:42.126 --> 32:44.212
He didn't… He didn't kill anybody?

32:45.672 --> 32:47.215
So where's Sleeping Beauty?

32:48.591 --> 32:49.968
-Bedroom.
-Yeah, of course.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.762
-Accident or some tabloid shit?
-Accident.

32:52.845 --> 32:55.014
Yeah, well,
that's what they all say. Hmm?

32:55.515 --> 32:59.227
Until they clear charges
or write their memoirs or shit.

32:59.310 --> 33:02.063
Celebrities! They're funny, right?

33:02.146 --> 33:04.023
-You know, your jokes are fucked up.

33:04.107 --> 33:05.817
Hello? Honey, I'm home.

33:06.401 --> 33:10.113
He's got a fucked-up sense of humor,
but he's right and exact. He's a pro.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.866
Is he a pro or is he somebody
that wants to be a fucking comedian?

33:14.409 --> 33:17.161
What was that? Is this a joke to him?

33:17.245 --> 33:19.914
She is dead. About as dead as dead can be.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.541
So here's what we're gonna do.

33:21.624 --> 33:24.544
We are going to order
room service, okay. For two people.

33:24.627 --> 33:27.964
We're gonna order two steaks,
two eggs, some juice.

33:28.047 --> 33:30.508
Hash browns,
you like hash browns? A little bacon.

33:31.217 --> 33:32.343
Tea and coffee.

33:33.553 --> 33:35.096
And a cheeseburger. Okay?

33:35.179 --> 33:38.433
Then I want you to go
to 20th and Commerce.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.643
You will find a beige Chrysler 300.

33:40.727 --> 33:45.231
I want you to drive that thing in
to the Cuthbert Street service entrance.

33:45.314 --> 33:49.277
You're gonna park it facing west,
20 feet from two double yellow doors.

33:49.360 --> 33:54.115
Most importantly, listen to me,
you're gonna reverse in from 19th Street.

33:54.198 --> 33:56.951
Why? Because the Chase Bank has cameras.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.494
I cannot look at that face!

33:59.662 --> 34:02.832
-That is… Oh. Anyway, you got it?
-Got it.

34:02.915 --> 34:04.083
Yeah?

34:04.167 --> 34:05.043
C, you got it?

34:05.752 --> 34:08.671
Yeah, he's got it. Kid, are you religious?

34:08.755 --> 34:10.798
-What?
-God. Do you believe in God?

34:12.050 --> 34:13.217
-Well…
-Doesn't matter.

34:13.301 --> 34:15.553
You don't have to believe in God
to believe in angels.

34:15.636 --> 34:17.472
Think of me as an angel

34:18.014 --> 34:21.601
who has come to you
in your darkest hour of need

34:21.684 --> 34:23.102
to guide you through it.

34:23.853 --> 34:25.730
Before I fade from memory.

34:27.356 --> 34:28.357
It's nice, right?

34:30.359 --> 34:31.235
No.

34:31.736 --> 34:34.363
Not when you put it like that,
it's not nice at all.

34:34.447 --> 34:37.325
All right, well, it will be nice
when we pull it off.

34:37.825 --> 34:40.453
Okay, okay, I ordered.

34:41.037 --> 34:44.207
Kid, you gotta keep
your shit together, okay?

34:44.791 --> 34:46.876
Can't have that look on your face
when room service comes.

34:46.959 --> 34:48.169
What face?

34:48.252 --> 34:51.297
That look like,
"a girl just died in my room"

34:51.380 --> 34:53.382
after you had sex with her.

34:53.466 --> 34:55.885
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Ari. Ari. K is out of this.

34:55.968 --> 34:57.470
-Mm-hmm.
-I got this.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.933
Hmm? You get the cart and the car.

35:02.725 --> 35:04.102
I'm gonna get started in there.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.480
What are you about to do in there?

35:08.356 --> 35:11.734
Uh, well, she's gonna need
a little help getting in that cart.

35:11.818 --> 35:13.111
Right? It's not very pretty,

35:13.194 --> 35:16.322
but you're welcome to watch
if that's what gets your dick hard.

35:16.823 --> 35:18.991
-What the fuck--? Is he playing?
-Stop. Stop.

35:19.075 --> 35:20.743
-Is he playing?
-Go to my room.

35:20.827 --> 35:22.620
-Is this a game?
-No. Go to my room.

35:22.703 --> 35:23.996
This is my fucking life.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.374
-Okay. Let's go.
-What's he talking about my dick for?

35:26.457 --> 35:29.710
-Come on. Go in the room.
-C, this ain't playing games, man.

35:30.419 --> 35:33.923
Okay. Just chill. It'll be over soon.

35:40.888 --> 35:43.641
How the fuck
did I get myself into this, man?

36:43.409 --> 36:47.413
You go up, I go down.
You go, "near." I go, "near."

36:48.873 --> 36:50.625
Wrote that while you were sleeping.

36:50.708 --> 36:52.585
-Where is she?
She's gone.

36:53.586 --> 36:55.087
What did you expect?

36:58.466 --> 36:59.842
That came as well.

36:59.926 --> 37:02.762
So, when Carlton gets here… Check it out.

37:03.888 --> 37:07.767
You gotta eat it,
or flush half of it, doesn't matter.

37:07.850 --> 37:09.727
It's gotta look
like it's eaten, all right?

37:10.353 --> 37:11.354
And the…

37:11.437 --> 37:14.273
I couldn't get fresh sheets because
that would mean we call housekeeping.

37:14.357 --> 37:16.943
So the dirty sheets
that are on the floor in there,

37:17.026 --> 37:19.195
I want you to grab them
and put them in the tub

37:19.278 --> 37:22.490
and run hot water over
and use those little bottles of shampoo.

37:22.573 --> 37:25.701
Dump the whole thing on there,
get her scent and her hair out,

37:25.785 --> 37:28.120
make sure the drain is open, of course.

37:28.204 --> 37:30.414
And, uh… Are you getting this?

37:31.290 --> 37:32.875
You want me to write it down for you?

37:34.543 --> 37:35.628
I'm kidding, right?

37:35.711 --> 37:38.923
Write it down. It's a fucking felony.
Why would you write it… down?

37:39.006 --> 37:42.218
But what you should do
is, uh, answer this question.

37:42.301 --> 37:44.971
If someone says,
"Have you seen this girl?"

37:45.054 --> 37:47.723
You say, "I don't know
who the fuck you're talking about."

37:48.391 --> 37:52.270
And don't pretend like this is your first
groupie whose name you don't remember.

37:53.396 --> 37:55.606
It's probably why
you're getting divorced, right?

37:56.691 --> 37:59.860
Don't give me that face.
Come on, man, it was in the papers.

38:00.569 --> 38:04.073
There is… one rule you gotta remember.

38:05.032 --> 38:08.828
And that is: no body, no crime.

38:10.371 --> 38:13.249
Listen. Girls like this,
they disappear all the time,

38:13.332 --> 38:14.834
and no one comes looking.

38:16.460 --> 38:17.753
So, we good?

38:19.046 --> 38:21.465
All right, let's talk about my fee.

38:21.549 --> 38:23.801
Carlton said that you were gonna, um…

38:24.719 --> 38:28.431
-That you was gonna hook him up.
-Would you do a set at my house for free?

38:31.684 --> 38:33.519
All right, then, how much does…

38:34.687 --> 38:38.899
How much does something like this cost?
Are we talking $50,000?

38:38.983 --> 38:41.027
Fifty thousand dollars? Um…

38:41.569 --> 38:43.112
Come on, man, you're rich.

38:43.821 --> 38:48.784
You made, what? 68 million
doing concerts, appearances, movies.

38:48.868 --> 38:50.411
That was just this year.

38:50.494 --> 38:52.913
So, no, I don't think 50 is gonna cut it.

38:57.668 --> 38:58.627
So how much?

38:59.170 --> 39:00.713
I'm thinking 500,000.

39:02.214 --> 39:03.174
A month.

39:04.633 --> 39:05.718
For a year.

39:14.310 --> 39:15.227
Five…

39:16.062 --> 39:18.314
Five hundred thousand dollars a month.

39:19.690 --> 39:22.818
For a year.
So you're talking about a total of…

39:22.902 --> 39:25.154
Six million dollars. Yeah.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.366
What? That's too much?

39:29.283 --> 39:31.994
Come on, you made that
from that Meryl Streep movie.

39:34.288 --> 39:36.040
Were you cool being her, uh, butler?

39:37.500 --> 39:40.044
-I'd be her butler for six million.
-Hey, you and Carlton friends?

39:40.127 --> 39:41.879
Friends don't mean you get a freebie.

39:41.962 --> 39:43.547
-So, six million?
-That's right.

39:44.173 --> 39:46.967
Come on.
Considering all you've given Carlton.

39:47.051 --> 39:49.470
I'm worth way more, dollar for dollar.

39:50.554 --> 39:52.264
Which is why you will pay me.

39:55.059 --> 39:56.811
First installment is due Monday.

40:00.439 --> 40:01.857
Number's on the card.

40:02.900 --> 40:06.404
And if I don't hear from you by 7:00 a.m.,

40:07.363 --> 40:10.157
then that story that runs on TMZ…

40:12.034 --> 40:15.204
that is going to be one
they will never forget.

40:17.206 --> 40:20.084
If you think I'm gonna go to the cops,
don't worry about that.

40:20.167 --> 40:24.338
Because what I'm gonna do to you if you
don't pay will be a hell of a lot worse.

40:34.974 --> 40:36.183
Come on now, eat up.

40:58.122 --> 40:59.498
Everything's taken care of.

41:00.583 --> 41:02.251
We're good.

41:04.837 --> 41:06.297
Everything's gonna be okay.

41:08.382 --> 41:09.717
Everything will be okay?

41:10.801 --> 41:11.760
Yeah.

41:12.595 --> 41:14.346
He asked me for six million dollars, C.

41:14.430 --> 41:17.391
Six, what?
No, nah he wouldn't do that, man.

41:17.475 --> 41:22.229
He did it while you were fucking gone.
He asked me for six million dollars, C.

41:22.313 --> 41:23.814
This motherfucker!

41:25.858 --> 41:28.319
Hey, look, hey… Look K, man.

41:28.402 --> 41:31.322
I knew he was gonna cost you,
I ain't know it was gonna be all that.

41:31.405 --> 41:33.866
Let me just talk to him.
I know this motherfucker. I'll--

41:34.408 --> 41:35.576
I'll work it out.

41:36.827 --> 41:39.163
I got this. I got this. Okay?

41:39.246 --> 41:41.832
Why is it that
every time you tell me you got it,

41:41.916 --> 41:43.751
I feel like I get in more trouble?

41:43.834 --> 41:45.586
-You notice that?
-Trust me, bro.

41:46.170 --> 41:48.214
Whenever you say you got it,
you never have it.

41:48.297 --> 41:52.259
And I asked you, C. I asked you.
I said, "Don't fuck me on this one."

41:52.343 --> 41:55.054
That's what I said to you.
Now, I look up and I'm getting fucked.

41:55.971 --> 41:58.641
I'm getting fucked.
Why can't you do anything right?

41:59.892 --> 42:01.685
What's your record, 0 for a 100?

42:02.186 --> 42:05.648
As a matter of fact, I know because
I got people in LA keeping score,

42:05.731 --> 42:07.566
and they're keeping score with dollars.

42:07.650 --> 42:11.737
With fucking dollars.
Because that's what I spend on your ass.

42:12.238 --> 42:15.533
-Yo, careful, man.
-Careful? Careful for what?

42:17.284 --> 42:19.954
If Friday the 13th were a person,
it would be you.

42:20.538 --> 42:21.830
I'm your fucking younger brother.

42:21.914 --> 42:23.832
I've been
taking care of you my whole life.

42:23.916 --> 42:26.794
Un-fucking-real. All I've done for you,
and this is how you repay me?

42:26.877 --> 42:28.546
Man, fuck you with that bullshit.

42:29.421 --> 42:32.383
-Me going pro went south because of you.
-Stop with the going pro!

42:32.466 --> 42:35.302
Shut up, man! You didn't go pro
because you got caught on a corner.

42:35.386 --> 42:36.387
Oh, okay.

42:36.470 --> 42:39.974
You're not the only person who got caught
and had a chance to rebuild their life.

42:40.057 --> 42:40.933
Jay-Z did.

42:41.517 --> 42:43.310
Biggie did it. They somehow went up.

42:43.394 --> 42:45.980
But what did my brother do?
Well, he does what he always does.

42:46.063 --> 42:48.148
My brother somehow found a way to lose.

42:48.232 --> 42:51.151
Because that's what you do,
you fucking lose.

42:51.235 --> 42:54.989
This fucking loser act
that you've perfected over the years,

42:55.072 --> 42:56.991
guess what, it finally rubbed off.

42:57.074 --> 43:00.869
I'm right there with you, but now I got
a lot more to lose than just my career.

43:00.953 --> 43:02.538
A whole lot more.

43:02.621 --> 43:05.791
Your bitch-ass is all bold
now that the body gone?

43:05.874 --> 43:07.209
"Bitch-ass" now.

43:07.293 --> 43:10.421
Look, if you think I fucked up, then,

43:11.088 --> 43:13.924
you can go ahead and deal with Ari
any way you choose.

43:15.593 --> 43:16.885
But just remember this…

43:18.262 --> 43:20.389
This time,
you ain't paying for my fuck-up.

43:21.640 --> 43:24.184
This one is all yours.

43:25.394 --> 43:26.395
Bruh.

43:39.241 --> 43:40.743
<i>Hello.</i>
-Hey.

43:41.869 --> 43:44.955
-Hey. What up, Terry? Can you hear me?
<i>-Kid, is that you?</i>

43:45.039 --> 43:46.415
Yeah, it's me.

43:46.498 --> 43:48.417
<i>What time is it? Are you okay?</i>

43:48.500 --> 43:49.668
Um…

43:50.669 --> 43:53.339
Yeah, I'm good, it's, uh… You know.

43:54.048 --> 43:57.635
It's a little late, but I'm straight.
Dude, I'm thinking--

43:58.886 --> 44:00.721
I think it's time that I, um…

44:02.139 --> 44:05.351
I start doing more
for my family, man, right?

44:05.934 --> 44:08.145
Like, mainly… mainly Carlton.

44:09.229 --> 44:11.065
<i>You didn't talk to him, did you?</i>

44:11.774 --> 44:15.235
No, we talked.
We had a long talk, actually.

44:15.778 --> 44:16.612
Um…

44:16.695 --> 44:18.530
<i>You know,</i>
<i>maybe we should get Todd up. Huh?</i>

44:18.614 --> 44:20.658
-No. Don't do that, Terry.
<i>-What?</i>

44:20.741 --> 44:22.159
Don't fucking do that, man.

44:22.868 --> 44:24.995
-I didn't call Todd, I called you.
<i>-No, I know.</i>

44:25.079 --> 44:27.706
Now, what I want you to do is listen.

44:27.790 --> 44:28.749
<i>Okay.</i>

44:28.832 --> 44:30.751
For a change, just listen.

44:30.834 --> 44:31.794
<i>Okay.</i>

44:31.877 --> 44:32.878
I, um…

44:34.505 --> 44:36.507
I just want to set Carlton up
one last time.

44:36.590 --> 44:39.343
<i>Okay, all right. How much? When?</i>

44:45.015 --> 44:48.686
I feel like if I'm gonna do it,
I just wanna do it right, so…

44:50.229 --> 44:51.647
you know, I wanna give him like…

44:54.983 --> 44:56.652
I wanna give him, like, 500.

44:58.153 --> 45:01.407
500K at the top of every month.

45:05.035 --> 45:06.203
For the next year.

45:09.206 --> 45:12.710
<i>Kid, do you need me to send</i>
<i>the police to your room right now?</i>

45:12.793 --> 45:18.215
<i>-I mean, just gimme a sign. Is he there?</i>
No, Terry. What did I ask you to do?

45:18.298 --> 45:20.300
<i>-I know, but--</i>
-What did I ask you to do?

45:20.384 --> 45:23.053
<i>-Yeah, but--</i>
I said, for once, do your fucking job.

45:23.137 --> 45:27.266
<i>-I understand.</i>
-What I asked you to set my brother up.

45:27.349 --> 45:29.685
That means, in the morning,
call the fucking bank,

45:29.768 --> 45:31.562
tell the bank what I need.

45:31.645 --> 45:33.856
Transfer the money
so it goes to Carlton's account,

45:33.939 --> 45:36.233
and then… and then, moving forward,

45:37.067 --> 45:41.113
do the same thing at the top of the month
so it goes down for the--

45:41.613 --> 45:44.867
<i>Okay. Kid, you just can't give</i>
<i>somebody that kind of money.</i>

45:44.950 --> 45:45.909
<i>You can't.</i>

45:45.993 --> 45:48.370
<i>You have to report</i>
<i>something like this, declare it.</i>

45:48.454 --> 45:50.581
What are you talking about?
When--? Since when?

45:50.664 --> 45:53.083
I didn't-- Name another time
when I've had to do it.

45:53.167 --> 45:56.962
<i>It's the law. We get audited</i>
<i>every year for every dime you spend.</i>

46:02.009 --> 46:04.678
<i>-Kid, I've been doing this a long time.</i>

46:05.679 --> 46:09.391
<i>You give someone that kind of money,</i>
<i>it doesn't buy you what you think.</i>

46:09.475 --> 46:12.853
<i>It's a green light,</i>
<i>and they keep coming back for more.</i>

46:14.062 --> 46:17.649
<i>That kind of money,</i>
<i>it's not one last time.</i>

46:28.911 --> 46:30.370
-I hear you.
<i>-Okay.</i>

46:32.873 --> 46:35.000
-I just need to think, I need to, um...
<i>-Okay.</i>

46:37.961 --> 46:41.590
I need to think about,
you know, the whole thing.

46:41.673 --> 46:43.342
-So just hold off.
<i>-Yeah, take your time.</i>

46:43.425 --> 46:46.053
-Just hold off. Don't do shit.
<i>-Okay.</i>

46:46.136 --> 46:48.013
-Till I tell you to do it.
<i>-Okay. You got it.</i>

46:52.893 --> 46:55.562
My advice is to reopen the restaurant,

46:56.271 --> 46:58.857
you run the money through there,
and, boom, you declare it.

46:59.650 --> 47:03.362
Celebrities, they always go stupid with
their money in restaurants, it's simple.

47:04.822 --> 47:07.616
So, how are we gonna play it?

47:09.284 --> 47:10.410
I'll get you the money.

47:11.829 --> 47:14.706
I mean, but if you want me
to give you six mil,

47:14.790 --> 47:17.167
you gotta do better
than telling me it's all good.

47:17.251 --> 47:18.794
How may I ease your mind?

47:18.877 --> 47:21.421
Well, how do I know
it's not coming back on me?

47:21.505 --> 47:24.758
How do I know you haven't talked
to the world? Who else knows you're here?

47:24.842 --> 47:26.385
Who knows about this, knows about me?

47:26.468 --> 47:28.554
-I have none of these answers.
-Nobody.

47:28.637 --> 47:29.721
Except your brother.

47:30.722 --> 47:32.766
-You're just gonna have to trust me.
-No.

47:33.559 --> 47:35.894
No, that's not gonna fucking fly, man.

47:36.770 --> 47:40.065
You gotta do a much better job
of selling me than that, Ari.

47:40.816 --> 47:42.943
Okay, you gotta put my mind at ease.

47:43.026 --> 47:46.280
If you don't wanna put my mind
at ease, then maybe I keep the money.

47:46.363 --> 47:48.198
I'll take my chances with the cops.

47:48.282 --> 47:50.742
Me and you may end up
sharing a cell, for all I know.

47:50.826 --> 47:53.370
Okay, maybe we do.

47:53.453 --> 47:56.540
I'm sorry, man.
You're just not a very good actor.

47:56.623 --> 48:00.294
But I'll play with you, Hollywood.
All right? I'll play. How's this?

48:00.377 --> 48:04.923
In my line of work, someone finds out
I got my hooks into something fat,

48:05.007 --> 48:06.842
they want a piece of that action.

48:07.593 --> 48:08.760
And I don't want that.

48:09.553 --> 48:12.848
When you find gold, you don't tell
everyone where it's buried, right?

48:12.931 --> 48:14.474
You keep it all to yourself.

48:14.558 --> 48:18.186
And you, my friend,
I am going to keep all to myself.

48:18.270 --> 48:19.605
What about fucking Daphne?

48:19.688 --> 48:22.900
How are you so certain that the cops
won't find her body on their own?

48:22.983 --> 48:26.069
Because it's someplace safe
where nobody will find it.

48:26.153 --> 48:29.698
How do I know that in a month
you don't go and jack the price up on me?

48:29.781 --> 48:32.743
The minute I cash the first check,
I am your partner.

48:33.493 --> 48:35.412
-I share the same risk.
-You're my partner?

48:35.996 --> 48:39.458
Okay, so I guess that means
I gotta trust you, right?

48:46.882 --> 48:49.801
We're gonna do the, um…
we're gonna do the restaurant thing.

48:49.885 --> 48:51.053
Good.

48:51.136 --> 48:54.306
I'll put it in you and Carlton's name.
Y'all take it from there.

48:54.848 --> 48:58.226
After that, I don't wanna talk to you
no more. I don't wanna see your face.

48:58.310 --> 49:00.604
I don't wanna be associated
with you anymore.

49:00.687 --> 49:02.731
I don't know if I can do that, I mean,

49:04.274 --> 49:06.902
I kinda thought maybe
I'd be an… and actor,

49:06.985 --> 49:09.738
and maybe you could give me
a role in one of your movies.

49:09.821 --> 49:12.032
You just think
you can shit on me, don't you?

49:13.367 --> 49:15.786
You can shit all over me because
I need your fucking help,

49:15.869 --> 49:16.912
is that what you think?

49:16.995 --> 49:19.831
Kid, just take a fucking shower.

49:19.915 --> 49:23.418
Have a good shit. Stop waking up
with dead girls in your bed,

49:24.211 --> 49:25.754
and this will go away.

49:25.837 --> 49:28.590
You won't have to do this again.
Can we get on with it?

49:33.303 --> 49:35.180
How'd you get the body out of here?

49:36.056 --> 49:38.642
It's a hotel, there's cameras everywhere,
how'd you do it?

49:38.725 --> 49:40.102
I had to break some bones.

49:41.311 --> 49:44.106
Then I folded her up, into a little ball,

49:45.023 --> 49:46.942
and I stuffed her into the cart.

49:48.652 --> 49:50.946
We rolled that cart
to the service elevator.

49:52.155 --> 49:55.283
Fourth floor cameras are out,
so we went to the fourth floor and then…

49:56.493 --> 49:58.120
the trash chute's on the fourth floor,

49:58.203 --> 50:01.873
it leads down
to the Cuthbert Street Dumpster.

50:06.795 --> 50:10.924
You see, I used to have a contract
with this place, this hotel. So…

50:12.551 --> 50:15.512
And then I wrapped her in a tarp,

50:15.595 --> 50:18.515
and your brother and I,
we put her in the trunk of a car,

50:18.598 --> 50:20.934
and we went away.

50:22.227 --> 50:23.186
Okay.

50:25.188 --> 50:26.898
But I got a question for you now.

50:31.194 --> 50:32.821
How does it feel to be so rich?

50:32.904 --> 50:34.322
You're unreal, man.

50:36.033 --> 50:37.492
It's complicated.

50:37.576 --> 50:39.036
Well, I've got time.

50:40.871 --> 50:42.330
Bet you fucking do.

50:46.460 --> 50:48.712
Everything I got, I earned. That's all me.

50:50.047 --> 50:53.425
I never had my hand out,
I never took something that wasn't mine.

50:54.885 --> 50:56.136
I never hurt anybody.

50:57.262 --> 50:59.264
I took a lot of people with me.

50:59.347 --> 51:02.267
A whole lot of fucking people.
And all those people rely on me now.

51:02.350 --> 51:03.769
And now you rely on me.

51:04.686 --> 51:06.396
Being rich ain't that simple, Ari.

51:07.355 --> 51:09.357
Just like you
getting that dead body out of here,

51:09.441 --> 51:11.193
it's a lot of twists and turns.

51:12.486 --> 51:16.865
See, the funny thing about making money,
the more you make, the more you realize

51:16.948 --> 51:19.201
the money is secondary
to the decisions you make.

51:19.284 --> 51:21.578
Sorry. You really believe
that shit, right? Like…

51:21.661 --> 51:25.207
No, I'm asking because I saw you on TV,
you were doing all that motivational shit.

51:25.290 --> 51:28.001
And I thought it was
just a bunch of crap, a gimmick,

51:28.085 --> 51:30.754
but you're standing here telling me,
and you actually believe it.

51:30.837 --> 51:31.713
-I do.
-All right.

51:31.797 --> 51:35.258
When people run up on me and talk shit
and think they can get away with it,

51:35.342 --> 51:38.053
well, that's why that pisses me off.
It annoys me.

51:38.136 --> 51:40.972
It annoys the fuck out of me.
Because of what I believe, well…

51:41.056 --> 51:43.350
That's the reason
these same people can't take advantage.

51:43.433 --> 51:45.602
Will you just write the fucking check?

51:55.153 --> 51:56.154
I heard you.

51:59.491 --> 52:01.159
Write the fucking check.

52:03.578 --> 52:05.872
It's so easy to take too. Right?

52:07.374 --> 52:09.751
Everybody can just fucking take from me.

52:11.211 --> 52:14.464
-Why not? It's so fucking easy for me too.
-Uh-huh.

52:15.132 --> 52:16.883
'Cause everybody else assumes
that it's easy,

52:16.967 --> 52:20.470
but the difference between you
and everybody else is that you…

52:22.514 --> 52:23.765
you made a mistake.

52:25.517 --> 52:27.727
You told me how to get
the fucking body out!

52:29.938 --> 52:30.981
You fucker!

52:51.585 --> 52:52.419
Fuck you!

52:52.502 --> 52:53.837
-Fuck you!

52:54.462 --> 52:55.463
Fuck you!

53:01.887 --> 53:03.889
Fuck you! Huh?

53:03.972 --> 53:05.849
You wanna fucking take from me?

53:07.809 --> 53:08.810
Huh?

53:08.894 --> 53:10.729
You wanna fucking take from me?

53:11.521 --> 53:12.480
Huh?

53:14.107 --> 53:15.192
Fuck you.

53:17.402 --> 53:18.403
Fuck you.

53:23.074 --> 53:24.284
Get the fuck off me.

54:06.117 --> 54:08.286
What's up? What you doing up?
It's 2:00 a.m. there.

54:08.370 --> 54:11.581
<i>Patrick spent the night,</i>
<i>and we watched a scary movie.</i>

54:11.665 --> 54:13.458
You're not supposed to watch scary movies.

54:13.541 --> 54:15.210
<i>I know, but I did.</i>

54:15.293 --> 54:17.504
<i>Patrick's asleep, and now I'm afraid.</i>

54:17.587 --> 54:19.256
You ain't gotta be afraid, man.

54:20.257 --> 54:22.259
I told you that. Plus, the monsters, they…

54:23.635 --> 54:26.805
The monsters only come after
the people that they know are scared.

54:27.847 --> 54:29.266
<i>Are you having fun?</i>

54:37.524 --> 54:38.566
No.

54:40.652 --> 54:42.737
No, man, I'm not having fun.

54:44.656 --> 54:47.867
Why don't you go to bed, okay?
I'll call you in the morning.

54:47.951 --> 54:50.829
<i>Okay. Well, I love you.</i>

54:53.123 --> 54:54.499
I miss you.

54:54.582 --> 54:56.293
<i>-I miss you too.</i>
-Mm…

54:56.376 --> 54:57.752
<i>Go to bed, Dad.</i>

55:25.030 --> 55:26.656
What the fuck did you do?

55:31.870 --> 55:34.414
I decided that I didn't wanna pay
six million dollars.
