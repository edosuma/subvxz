00:16.225 --> 00:17.267
Status check.

00:17.267 --> 00:20.896
<i>Lunar cargo return.
Baker Zulu nine three.</i>

00:20.896 --> 00:22.981
<i>Touchdown in 22 minutes.</i>

00:22.981 --> 00:25.567
<i>Approaching atmospheric reentry.</i>

00:26.568 --> 00:28.028
Hold on to that stick, pal.

00:30.322 --> 00:31.949
Here comes the big boom.

00:35.786 --> 00:36.912
You're coming.

00:36.912 --> 00:41.124
I'm seeing you dead, you Gargon scum!

00:45.754 --> 00:47.714
There it is. That's where he's headed.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.550
- Start the car.
- No.

00:51.927 --> 00:55.222
I think we're gonna stay here
and talk a minute.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.022
Wow.

01:05.190 --> 01:08.861
When that goes in the other direction,
kids, we are on it.

01:14.199 --> 01:15.409
Not built for war.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.244
Oh, shit.

01:21.874 --> 01:23.208
Where's the bag?

01:24.835 --> 01:26.670
Where's the bag? Okay.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.214
Shit.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.759
Okay, where's the bag?

01:33.760 --> 01:35.220
Where's the bag?

01:35.220 --> 01:37.389
Hey, Mr. Porter. You see that?

01:37.389 --> 01:42.102
I know it is old hat to you,
but what a magical sight, huh?

01:46.356 --> 01:47.357
What is?

01:49.526 --> 01:50.903
That's good.

01:50.903 --> 01:53.155
He act like he don't know his own rocket.

01:53.155 --> 01:54.656
Herbie, you heard him.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.825
That's your rocket.

01:59.286 --> 02:00.787
Possibly it is.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.800
What makes you think
you can build this thing?

02:54.800 --> 02:56.718
'Cause I know you're not just stupid.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.555
Surprise me, Jack.

03:04.977 --> 03:07.813
Look, you're the only one in the world
who's ever gonna know this.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.440
Or ever needs to.

03:13.235 --> 03:15.529
It's amazing what we've been able
to do together.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.905
Whatever is thrown at us,

03:16.905 --> 03:19.283
you can hang your hat, your coat,

03:19.283 --> 03:21.827
your whole goddamn future
on us figuring out--

03:21.827 --> 03:24.454
And I'm so grateful
to have you as a partner.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.206
- I want to keep that go--
- No.

03:26.790 --> 03:27.791
No, goddamn it.

03:29.084 --> 03:31.128
- What?
- Say it.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.672
- You have to say it.
- Shir--

03:33.672 --> 03:35.507
- Shirl.
- Say it.

03:42.472 --> 03:43.473
It was all me.

03:48.478 --> 03:49.646
There's no Jenkins.

03:51.273 --> 03:55.485
Or if there is, it's me.

03:58.030 --> 04:03.243
Which is why the smart money is on us
taking this as far as we can dream.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.578
We've got people who believe i--

04:07.289 --> 04:08.457
You don't know this,

04:09.082 --> 04:12.211
but we've got land, we got transportation,
we got enough money to--

04:15.172 --> 04:17.757
You're too smart
not to see this opportunity, Shirley.

04:21.345 --> 04:22.846
I'm sorry!

04:26.183 --> 04:28.977
You've been nothing but loyal to me,
and I lied to you.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.356
I'm sorry.

04:34.358 --> 04:35.359
I'm sorry.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.281
I can't do this without you.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.078
Well, you should've
thought about that before.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.416
You made me lose my mind.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.919
I will do whatever it takes
to make it right.

04:53.919 --> 04:57.339
- Partners, right down the middle.
- You can't stop, can you?

04:57.840 --> 04:58.882
It's sick.

04:58.882 --> 05:02.010
You got no idea what's real anymore.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.179
Who does?

05:05.889 --> 05:09.393
We turned people's lives around.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.395
What's that?

05:14.022 --> 05:19.528
What is life without a dream
to make it go down easy?

05:22.030 --> 05:24.283
Whatever the hell that means, Jack.

05:28.579 --> 05:30.038
You're on your fucking own.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.457
No.

05:32.958 --> 05:37.004
No! Shirley. We're so close!

05:43.260 --> 05:45.470
See that up there? Right there.

05:45.470 --> 05:50.058
- That beautiful glow? Our rocket.
- How beautiful. A glow, really.

05:51.310 --> 05:52.895
Which is actually one of our rockets.

05:52.895 --> 05:54.813
So some of you should feel
a little sheepish

05:54.813 --> 05:57.733
after all of that doubt and sour grapes.

05:57.733 --> 06:01.778
- It's a return trip from the Brightside.
- Coming on home from the Brightside.

06:01.778 --> 06:05.115
- And we're gonna watch it land.
- Ready to wash our hands.

06:06.325 --> 06:07.784
Watch it land.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.496
Washing our hands is very important.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.040
But let's also watch it land.

06:14.166 --> 06:15.626
Y'all listen to this man, now.

06:16.460 --> 06:17.878
That is the God's honest.

06:18.670 --> 06:21.173
I seen every bit of it myself.

06:22.508 --> 06:23.634
Thank you, Mr. Mason.

06:24.551 --> 06:27.888
Now, follow us
for a great customer experience.

06:34.686 --> 06:38.273
We have to go and see.
It's gonna be a disaster, right?

06:38.273 --> 06:40.776
No establishable connection to the entity.

06:40.776 --> 06:43.487
No establishable passenger sanction
on the vessel.

06:43.487 --> 06:44.571
Exactly.

06:46.323 --> 06:49.701
But it does seem
to have "paficied" the crowd.

06:50.202 --> 06:52.079
Joey left these behind.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.039
And since it is a company car...

06:54.039 --> 06:55.749
You're great in a crisis, Bun Bun.

06:55.749 --> 06:56.834
Herb.

06:56.834 --> 06:58.585
Herb, have you seen a bag of money?

06:58.585 --> 07:00.629
Or any crooks looking fucking smug
at my expense?

07:00.629 --> 07:02.756
I'm in very deep trouble here.

07:03.382 --> 07:04.383
Come with us, Ed.

07:04.383 --> 07:05.968
It's an exciting time for the company,

07:05.968 --> 07:08.762
and there's actually a perfectly great
explanation about the money.

07:10.639 --> 07:12.516
Why would you have an explanation? Herb!

07:58.645 --> 08:00.731
<i>Ten minutes to touchdown.</i>

08:01.356 --> 08:03.859
<i>Initiate launchpad reorientation.</i>

08:05.152 --> 08:06.361
Goddamn.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.073
Doesn't get any easier, does it?

08:11.742 --> 08:14.244
I swear, I will bring you in safe.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.666
Next time, try American made!

08:20.542 --> 08:22.252
For the good of the fucking company?

08:22.252 --> 08:25.422
What fucking good has
the company ever done you, Herb? Huh?

08:25.422 --> 08:29.218
What kind of a bootlicking patsy
gives his hard-earned money back

08:29.218 --> 08:33.388
to the people that he hard-earned it from
and calls that "good"?

08:33.388 --> 08:34.472
Well, Eddie, I--

08:34.472 --> 08:38.477
"Well, Eddie, I do. Because if I live
a stunted and pathetic enough life,

08:38.477 --> 08:40.354
gargling down the boss's crotch-sweat,

08:40.354 --> 08:43.357
Mommy might pat my little head
and give me a sweetie."

08:43.357 --> 08:45.817
I took your money, you big jerk!

08:45.817 --> 08:47.277
So stop hitting him!

08:47.277 --> 08:49.613
You? Well, I should've known, huh?

08:49.613 --> 08:54.618
I mean, who's more base and conniving than
Little Miss Prim-and-Perjured Twin-Faker?

09:05.212 --> 09:06.421
They weren't fake.

09:07.548 --> 09:08.841
They were optimistic.

09:09.925 --> 09:12.719
Now, Betty's going to stop this car,

09:13.804 --> 09:15.764
and I would like for you to get out

09:16.265 --> 09:19.393
so I could fulfill
my professional responsibilities

09:20.143 --> 09:22.521
without any more distractions.

09:27.526 --> 09:29.862
Well, just added this
to the list of charges, Herb.

09:30.362 --> 09:32.239
I hope you find a comfortable ride home.

09:32.823 --> 09:35.576
Grand larceny,
plus assault and battery now, okay?

09:37.619 --> 09:38.745
Gun it, Bun Bun.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.248
"Gun it, Bun Bun."

09:42.040 --> 09:45.627
Plus, I lost a button on my coat, Herb!

09:47.004 --> 09:48.338
Goddamn it.

09:49.131 --> 09:52.259
Walt! You in there?

09:52.259 --> 09:53.719
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

09:53.719 --> 09:56.471
<i>I think you may have someone
on the loose in there.</i>

09:56.471 --> 09:59.391
Let me come in
and take 'em off your hands.

09:59.975 --> 10:01.435
You shouldn't be in here, Jack.

10:01.435 --> 10:03.896
If he stays where he is,
he's gonna get burned up.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.064
<i>Please, Walt!</i>

10:11.612 --> 10:13.530
<i>Touch that fence,
you'll get yourself hurt.</i>

10:14.489 --> 10:16.241
Do what you've gotta do!

10:19.286 --> 10:20.287
<i>Cleared for--</i>

10:24.333 --> 10:27.044
<i>Message, 7:05 p.m.</i>

10:27.044 --> 10:28.337
<i>Hey, kid.</i>

10:28.837 --> 10:30.839
<i>I know you're upset.
You got every right in the world.</i>

10:30.839 --> 10:33.008
<i>I just wanted to call to tell you that,</i>

10:33.008 --> 10:36.553
<i>I made the deal
that I was telling you about,</i>

10:36.553 --> 10:39.640
<i>and it is gonna change everything.</i>

10:39.640 --> 10:42.142
<i>We're right where we need to be,
right on time.</i>

10:42.142 --> 10:44.895
<i>And your job is here waiting for you</i>

10:44.895 --> 10:47.773
<i>whenever you're ready
to come along for the ride.</i>

10:48.482 --> 10:50.817
<i>And don't be a hero
about the hospital bills.</i>

10:50.817 --> 10:52.861
<i>I'm the reason you quit your damn job,</i>

10:52.861 --> 10:55.447
<i>so let me make sure
it doesn't sink you and your mom.</i>

10:55.447 --> 10:56.532
<i>It's...</i>

10:58.033 --> 10:59.743
<i>least I could do.</i>

11:01.703 --> 11:03.121
<i>Talk soon, I hope.</i>

11:03.121 --> 11:04.665
<i>All right, take care, kid.</i>

11:16.927 --> 11:19.429
Buck! Hey, it's Jacky boy!

11:19.429 --> 11:21.014
Come on down!

11:22.140 --> 11:24.059
What's wrong with him?

11:24.726 --> 11:25.894
He's nuts.

11:25.894 --> 11:28.021
Stays up there, he'll be dead too!

11:31.775 --> 11:35.445
This is not good, Jack!
That thing's about to land on you!

11:36.029 --> 11:37.030
Buck!

11:50.669 --> 11:52.045
Are we going in, or what?

11:52.045 --> 11:54.590
Yeah, right.
Don't we get to go in and see?

11:54.590 --> 11:57.509
Wait, sir.
For your own safety, stay right there.

11:57.509 --> 11:58.802
Papa, up there.

12:01.096 --> 12:03.557
Now, I'm sure you've all heard of
a safety radius.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.517
And I'm sure none of us
would want to violate that,

12:05.517 --> 12:07.686
which would mean violating our own safety.

12:07.686 --> 12:09.021
Excuse me, sir.

12:10.105 --> 12:13.150
Respect the radius.

12:16.778 --> 12:17.779
Buck!

12:19.823 --> 12:21.366
One shot, Sheriff,

12:21.366 --> 12:26.288
so our children
and grandchildren grow up free.

12:26.288 --> 12:27.623
Buck!

12:27.623 --> 12:30.417
Oh, Jesus, Jack. Goddamn you.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.378
<i>Gargon mind-fogger.</i>

12:34.296 --> 12:37.966
Now, everyone,
please enjoy the wonderful view,

12:37.966 --> 12:40.761
and take a moment
to consider your upgrade options.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.721
Whatever you are selling, sign me up.

12:42.721 --> 12:44.264
I'll take one of those.

12:45.015 --> 12:47.309
- For you, sir. Be safe.
- Thank you.

12:47.309 --> 12:48.727
Okay, and one for you.

12:49.394 --> 12:52.064
Damn it, Buck! That rocket right there,
it's gonna fry us.

12:54.024 --> 12:56.485
I'm here saving mankind.

12:56.485 --> 12:59.196
Don't let this be your funeral, Sheriff.

12:59.196 --> 13:02.741
You're damn right! "Sheriff" to you!

13:03.450 --> 13:04.576
Whoever you are.

13:06.245 --> 13:07.955
Now, get!

13:11.375 --> 13:13.585
Jack, what the hell are you doing now?

13:13.585 --> 13:15.379
<i>Deploying landing gear.</i>

13:17.130 --> 13:19.216
They can't land that here, can they?

13:20.133 --> 13:21.552
Looks like a real rocket.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.930
It does appear real.

13:29.852 --> 13:32.521
Sheriff, can you hear me?

13:32.521 --> 13:36.608
No! Stay back!
I'm about to unload a QuarkStorm!

13:37.276 --> 13:39.695
Sheriff. I am on your side.

13:41.488 --> 13:44.241
Sheriff. You blasted the Gargon fleet.

13:45.242 --> 13:46.285
You did it!

13:46.785 --> 13:49.496
The gas attack, it screwed your memory.

13:50.080 --> 13:52.875
I was protected by my Trinnium Suit
thanks to you.

13:52.875 --> 13:57.337
But we have got to get out
of the blast zone now, Sheriff.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.423
I don't trust rogue agents.

14:04.887 --> 14:07.890
I never thought I'd get so up close
to see one like this.

14:08.473 --> 14:12.603
On TV, but, yeah, this is much better.

14:14.021 --> 14:17.566
Sheriff, you saved us.

14:19.359 --> 14:23.280
Maybe. I don't know a damn thing anymore.

14:25.115 --> 14:28.493
All you need to know
is that you're a hero.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.747
Pride of the galaxy.

14:36.502 --> 14:39.880
I can't argue with justice.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.382
That's right.

14:42.966 --> 14:44.801
Now, let's get you back to the ranch.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.054
- Run!
- Go!

14:47.054 --> 14:51.099
<i>Initiating landing sequence.
All systems go.</i>

14:55.395 --> 14:56.438
There you are.

14:57.689 --> 14:59.483
I've been dreaming all about you.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.487
- It's so pretty, Papa.
- Oh, yeah.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.658
But it's not half as pretty
as where she's gonna take us.

15:21.964 --> 15:24.967
There it is, Les. Right there.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.387
I guess I didn't think...

15:30.222 --> 15:32.057
It's highly "unpexcepted."

15:36.395 --> 15:38.397
I really wanted it not to be there.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.526
I wanted it to be a lie.

15:43.944 --> 15:47.322
Finally had someone to blame
for the mess I made of my life.

15:49.074 --> 15:50.409
Mrs. Mayburn?

15:54.997 --> 15:57.291
Maybe we just went a little nuts.

15:59.501 --> 16:05.090
We were both lonely,
looking for something, and we found...

16:07.509 --> 16:08.760
We found...

16:16.727 --> 16:17.936
I don't know.

16:19.813 --> 16:22.065
Maybe I've been fooling myself
a lot lately.

16:35.412 --> 16:37.831
Hey, this will warm you up.

16:46.131 --> 16:48.133
I'm sorry
I brought all this trouble your way,

16:48.133 --> 16:51.428
but for what it's worth, it's great to see
that you're still flying.

16:51.428 --> 16:54.640
I don't need any of this.

16:55.599 --> 16:57.809
I get it.

17:05.526 --> 17:06.944
Who you working for, anyway?

17:07.653 --> 17:11.156
Cargo runs. Mostly booze and trash.

17:16.453 --> 17:17.871
So I guess it's up to you

17:18.497 --> 17:21.834
if you want to live half a life,
shut the world out, pretend it's peaceful,

17:21.834 --> 17:23.752
but you don't look happy.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.089
You're way too brilliant
to waste away out here.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.469
I got good work for you.

17:34.263 --> 17:36.598
When you're ready, it's something big.
Think about it.

17:38.392 --> 17:41.270
I heard that pitch before,
from your old man.

17:45.774 --> 17:48.569
This time you deserve it coming true.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.501
Hey, Shirl.

18:06.170 --> 18:08.338
Hey, Joe. Thought you were done here.

18:09.590 --> 18:10.591
Yeah.

18:10.591 --> 18:12.384
Hey, do you know where Jack is?

18:13.385 --> 18:14.553
Why?

18:15.220 --> 18:18.473
Because I thought I owe it to him to,
you know, hear him out.

18:18.473 --> 18:20.225
Roped you back in, huh?

18:20.225 --> 18:23.604
- No, it's not like that.
- I know what it's like.

18:24.313 --> 18:25.981
All you want is to believe in him.

18:25.981 --> 18:28.609
Well, turns out
that's a pretty shitty ride.

18:28.609 --> 18:31.695
Okay, well, I guess I'll have to see
for myself, right?

18:32.821 --> 18:33.947
I mean, who knows?

18:36.116 --> 18:38.035
Well, maybe he'll be different with you.

18:40.329 --> 18:41.580
Since you're family.

18:45.292 --> 18:49.505
You'll probably never hear this from him,
but it's better you know.

18:55.177 --> 18:56.553
He's your dad, Joe.

19:03.977 --> 19:07.523
Just don't waste your life
waiting on him to do the right thing.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.151
You're better than that.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.113
Come on, now.

19:18.116 --> 19:19.660
It's gonna be all right.

19:29.211 --> 19:30.212
Just hold on.

19:35.175 --> 19:37.970
Sorry about that mix-up a little earlier.

19:40.931 --> 19:42.975
Hoping my seat's still reserved?

19:44.101 --> 19:45.435
Great decision, sir.

19:45.936 --> 19:47.771
Your brighter tomorrow starts today.

19:49.314 --> 19:50.357
Again.

20:03.245 --> 20:04.329
Papa, who's that?

20:04.329 --> 20:07.666
That is Mr. Billings
and the Space Sheriff, honey.

20:08.458 --> 20:09.543
A pair of heroes.

20:10.252 --> 20:13.922
Welcome home, Sheriff.
The galaxy is in your hands.

20:16.341 --> 20:18.302
- Hey, Jack.
- What the hell's happening here?

20:18.302 --> 20:20.679
Well, there are a few upgrades pending, and...

20:22.431 --> 20:23.807
I guess I made my own turf.

20:26.059 --> 20:27.644
They'd love to hear from you, sir.

20:31.481 --> 20:32.608
Yeah, look at 'em!

20:34.860 --> 20:35.861
Oh, yeah!

20:35.861 --> 20:37.196
You did great, Herb.

20:37.196 --> 20:39.364
- Welcome back, Herb!
- You did great!

20:39.364 --> 20:42.618
Hey! It's a pleasure to see you all.

20:43.202 --> 20:45.078
The Sheriff is back down
on urgent business.

20:45.078 --> 20:48.081
Flew down from the Brightside
in luxury and style,

20:48.081 --> 20:49.791
so let's give him a warm welcome.

20:49.791 --> 20:51.835
- It's the Space Sheriff!
- Yeah!

20:53.504 --> 20:58.550
That's right, and we will see you all
back here for blastoff in no time.

20:58.550 --> 21:00.427
There's your ride, by the way.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.763
Look at that. She's a beauty, huh?

21:02.763 --> 21:05.474
Oh, God, wait till you see the inside.

21:06.058 --> 21:08.185
Ain't no law in the stars but me.

21:08.185 --> 21:12.147
I'm just gonna go see
what they're all talking about.

21:13.190 --> 21:14.191
You know...

21:14.191 --> 21:16.610
Thank you so much.

21:16.610 --> 21:20.405
...I have noted "mulpitle" violations.

21:41.176 --> 21:45.180
- I got 'em all. Right?
- You got 'em all.

21:47.641 --> 21:50.269
I could smell the grave.

21:53.272 --> 21:55.649
You don't know what it's like, son.

21:58.902 --> 21:59.903
Every day...

22:01.780 --> 22:04.157
if you slip an inch...

22:07.119 --> 22:08.996
the whole goddamn universe...

22:11.707 --> 22:12.708
goes to ruin.

22:17.379 --> 22:19.006
How do you do it, Sheriff?

22:23.468 --> 22:24.469
How do you--

22:26.513 --> 22:27.723
How do you pull it off?

22:30.434 --> 22:32.144
I just tell myself...

22:35.105 --> 22:39.151
"One day, I'll be dead."

22:40.777 --> 22:41.945
And what then?

23:00.589 --> 23:01.673
Good evening, sir.

23:04.593 --> 23:06.720
What good's the moon anyway, huh?

23:07.721 --> 23:09.473
The fuck happened to you?

23:12.267 --> 23:14.603
I know you didn't like me
too much with money,

23:14.603 --> 23:17.689
so, I took care of that.

23:19.107 --> 23:20.359
Okay.

23:21.652 --> 23:23.654
Well, I'm making some changes too.

23:24.404 --> 23:26.448
Yeah. Uh-huh.

23:32.788 --> 23:34.122
About done here.

23:38.168 --> 23:40.295
Well, I just came in here to warm up,

23:40.295 --> 23:42.297
maybe find a friendly face,

23:42.297 --> 23:48.095
but strikes me I could do that
just as good with you in your car.

23:50.722 --> 23:52.641
You might end up going for a ride.

23:55.185 --> 23:58.230
Shirley, the longer the better.

24:08.907 --> 24:09.908
Shut up.

24:10.576 --> 24:11.660
Come on.

24:19.126 --> 24:20.544
Good morning, guest.

24:20.544 --> 24:23.088
Would you like me to assist you
with transportation?

24:28.051 --> 24:30.137
Well, I got our sheriff home
safe and sound.

24:30.762 --> 24:32.931
Won't happen again.
You weren't worried, were you?

24:32.931 --> 24:35.809
I do make a habit
of underestimating people.

24:35.809 --> 24:37.811
Well, that can't be fun.

24:39.104 --> 24:40.981
I signed your little paper.

24:42.274 --> 24:44.401
It was as easy as lying.

24:47.571 --> 24:49.823
Well, I guess the galaxy's in our hands.

25:20.521 --> 25:21.522
Joe!

25:22.022 --> 25:24.900
We did it! We closed the deal.

25:25.692 --> 25:30.072
And we are gonna build it.
You and me. Partners.

25:30.781 --> 25:31.782
Why, Jack?

25:33.325 --> 25:34.326
Why me?

25:34.326 --> 25:38.580
Wha-- Because we're great together.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.832
- I care about you, kid.
- No, you don't.

25:40.832 --> 25:42.543
You don't give a fuck about me.

25:43.168 --> 25:47.256
Not when you left us.
Not when you came back.

25:48.006 --> 25:51.468
And not when you lied to my face
every single fucking day.

25:54.263 --> 25:56.390
I don't care who you think you are, Jack.

25:59.226 --> 26:00.727
You're not my dad.
