WEBVTT

00:04.713 --> 00:06.256
Should be a quiet shift, Norm.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.216
No appointments.

00:08.550 --> 00:09.926
No major operations pending.

00:10.218 --> 00:12.262
Don't give us a thought, Captain.
(clears throat)

00:12.345 --> 00:14.889
Oh, Inspector Scapizzi says, uh,

00:14.973 --> 00:16.683
private design consultant
may be visiting today.

00:16.766 --> 00:17.892
-(knocks on door)
-I will handle it.

00:17.976 --> 00:19.894
-(door opens)
-City comptroller for you, Captain,

00:19.978 --> 00:20.854
line two.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.732
-Frank...
-I got it.

00:24.941 --> 00:25.775
Go on.

00:26.651 --> 00:27.652
(clears throat)

00:27.736 --> 00:28.695
(door opens)

00:30.155 --> 00:31.114
(door closes)

00:31.656 --> 00:32.866
Lieutenant Buntz.

00:34.409 --> 00:35.952
No, Captain's off for the day.

00:37.328 --> 00:39.164
(clears throat) I'm in charge.

00:41.708 --> 00:42.876
Yeah, sure, I'll hold.

00:45.545 --> 00:46.463
(exhales)

01:03.772 --> 01:05.607
Item nine. Item nine.

01:05.690 --> 01:08.943
People, this being Portuguese
American citizenship week,

01:09.027 --> 01:13.531
be advised the city fathers
have renamed Blackstone Avenue

01:13.823 --> 01:17.368
in honor of the late, distinguished
councilman from the 7th District.

01:17.452 --> 01:22.123
Henceforth, traffic citations
on the said thoroughfare shall read,

01:22.999 --> 01:25.960
"Alberto Juarez Aguilera Avenue."

01:26.044 --> 01:27.754
-(murmuring)
-Alberto who?

01:27.837 --> 01:28.671
Can you spell that for me?

01:28.755 --> 01:30.507
No offense to our Portuguese
brothers, Sarge,

01:30.590 --> 01:34.844
but that is, uh, County Route 104,
so couldn't we just write the ticket, uh,

01:34.928 --> 01:36.638
"Happened on County Route 104"

01:36.721 --> 01:39.099
instead of having to learn a foreign
language that has glottal stops?

01:39.182 --> 01:41.768
HOWARD:
Community relations matter, Andrew.

01:41.851 --> 01:45.230
Uh, you can take it up
with Lieutenant Goldblume upon his return.

01:45.313 --> 01:47.774
In regards to which item ten relates

01:47.857 --> 01:51.111
in that both Lieutenant Goldblume
and Captain Furillo

01:51.194 --> 01:53.321
are <i>hors de combat</i> today.

01:53.404 --> 01:57.450
Sitting on the orals examination panel
for new lieutenants.

01:57.867 --> 01:59.911
Taking station command Lieutenant Buntz.

02:00.203 --> 02:01.579
-Buntz?
-HOWARD: Assignments.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.623
-First time for everything, babe.
-Assignments are successful

02:03.706 --> 02:07.710
buy and bust operation continues
in the Jefferson corridor.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.797
Uh, Mintz and Russo,
keep up the good collars.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.676
Bates, Flaherty, Aldrich,
Jackson on backup.

02:14.759 --> 02:19.848
Uh, Partnet called in sick this morning.
So Butler rides with Kerwyn.

02:19.931 --> 02:22.350
Oh, does Lieutenant want a word?

02:23.726 --> 02:25.061
Yeah. (clears throat)

02:26.020 --> 02:28.314
Yeah, if I could just have a minute here.

02:29.774 --> 02:30.859
(coughs)

02:32.360 --> 02:35.321
I, uh, I got some news, and it stinks.

02:36.322 --> 02:39.242
-We're losing our overtime pay.
-(all groaning)

02:39.325 --> 02:40.368
-NORMAN: I know.
-What?

02:40.451 --> 02:43.163
It looks like we're going back
to taking overtime and days off.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.289
You're joking.

02:44.372 --> 02:48.751
You know, I am the PBA representative,
and this is an unconstitutional--

02:48.835 --> 02:50.712
Hey, hey, hey.
What's going on, Lieutenant?

02:51.045 --> 02:53.631
Well, I just got off the horn
with the city comptroller,

02:53.715 --> 02:55.884
and it seems like there's a problem
with our portion

02:55.967 --> 02:58.219
in the state-wide asset forfeiture grant.

02:58.303 --> 02:59.637
You mind translating that?

02:59.721 --> 03:03.850
(sighs) All right, now, we all know
that ever since Proposition 9 was passed,

03:04.100 --> 03:09.230
that the-the city hasn't had the cash
to put our overtime pay in the budget.

03:09.314 --> 03:12.442
Which means that we've been
using the money from the state program.

03:12.525 --> 03:15.486
The city doles it out to each precinct,

03:15.570 --> 03:18.656
uh, based on how much dope we pull in.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.575
Now, it looked like we made our quota,

03:20.783 --> 03:24.829
but them bean counters downtown
say they made a mistake now.

03:24.913 --> 03:29.209
They have now decided
that the credit on that Mackler bust,

03:29.292 --> 03:33.213
one quarter of a million worth of soda,
goes to Division and not to us.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.131
-(shouting)
-NEAL: Hey, we made that case!

03:35.215 --> 03:38.009
-We tailed Mackler for a month!
-Division didn't come in till the end.

03:38.092 --> 03:39.344
I'm not here to argue.

03:39.427 --> 03:42.013
I mean, decision's final,
and there's no appeal process.

03:42.096 --> 03:45.892
Which means we are 130 grand
short of our quota.

03:45.975 --> 03:48.102
-When's the deadline?
-Tonight.

03:48.186 --> 03:50.980
-Goodbye greenbacks.
-J.D.: You know what happened.

03:51.064 --> 03:54.442
You know Division came up short
on its quota and stiffed us.

03:54.525 --> 03:56.194
-(murmuring)
-They always do, lover.

03:56.277 --> 03:59.322
All right, look, look.
Uh, there may be a shot here.

03:59.572 --> 04:02.909
I mean, 130 grand
is just a drop in the ocean

04:02.992 --> 04:05.328
of abusable substances out there.

04:05.787 --> 04:06.955
Think about it.

04:07.205 --> 04:11.084
Normal course of business,
we want collars. Busts that stick.

04:11.626 --> 04:12.460
Today...

04:12.961 --> 04:16.589
we are looking to confiscate dope, period.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.174
-MAN: Yeah, but, Lieutenant--
-Hypothetical--

04:18.258 --> 04:20.468
you know a guy's dirty, you pop him.

04:20.551 --> 04:23.721
Turns out probable cause to search
won't hold up in court.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.350
Unfortunate, but it happens,
suspect walks.

04:27.433 --> 04:28.268
But...

04:29.227 --> 04:32.689
the contraband stays
right here in custody.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.440
-(murmuring)
-You saying anything goes, Lieutenant?

04:34.524 --> 04:37.068
Hey, hey, hey, I say that?
Anybody hear me say that?

04:37.735 --> 04:41.781
All I'm saying is we are 130 grand
short of our quota,

04:41.864 --> 04:46.452
and we got seven and one-third hours
to do something about it.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.579
-(cheering, shouting)
-MAN: Let's get out of here.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.332
All right!

04:54.377 --> 04:55.962
Yeah! Come on!

04:57.755 --> 04:58.923
(murmuring)

05:00.258 --> 05:01.092
Dismissed.

05:01.175 --> 05:04.012
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:04.095 --> 05:06.055
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:06.139 --> 05:09.726
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Avenue and 124th Street.</i>

05:09.809 --> 05:11.352
(sirens wailing)

05:17.191 --> 05:20.111
(theme music playing)

07:03.506 --> 07:05.925
First, it's the moonlighting.
Now, it's the overtime.

07:06.008 --> 07:08.928
I just found this great apartment
over on Riverton.

07:09.011 --> 07:12.140
Built-in microwave,
carpets, curtains, everything.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.142
Daryl Ann is starting
her own cooking business

07:14.225 --> 07:15.601
-in order to make ends meet.
-(exhales)

07:15.685 --> 07:17.687
-I know.
-I am supposed to be the breadwinner.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.313
-This is deliberate...
-I know.

07:19.397 --> 07:22.150
...on the part of the city
to deprive us of our manhood.

07:23.109 --> 07:26.279
I'll tell you, man, the only thing
I'm gonna worry about today is dope!

07:26.362 --> 07:29.282
-Let's just take it easy.
-No problem.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.034
BOBBY: What do we got here, Renko?

07:32.118 --> 07:33.828
(tires screech)

07:33.911 --> 07:36.205
-(chatter)
-(car door opens, closes)

07:36.289 --> 07:37.707
Hold it right there!
Get up against the wall right now!

07:37.790 --> 07:39.709
-Get up against the wall!
-(overlapping shouting)

07:39.792 --> 07:41.961
-BOBBY: Spread your feet apart!
-What's happening, man?

07:42.044 --> 07:43.963
-You got some sort of warrant?
-Shut up!

07:44.213 --> 07:46.674
Now, we're looking for a man
named Otis Jenks,

07:46.757 --> 07:47.884
-have you seen him?
-No.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.844
-How about you, you seen him?
-No, never heard of the dude, man!

07:49.927 --> 07:51.971
-You are a liar!
-Who is he?

07:52.054 --> 07:53.306
I am looking for Otis Jenks!

07:53.389 --> 07:56.100
If you see Otis Jenks, you tell him
I'm looking for him, all right?

07:56.184 --> 07:58.269
-You got that?
-Yeah, okay, okay.

07:58.352 --> 08:00.396
-Is this your stuff right here?
-(overlapping shouting)

08:00.480 --> 08:02.273
-Get out!
-Get out! Get out!

08:02.356 --> 08:04.317
-Get out of here!
-Out, out!

08:06.402 --> 08:08.362
Who in the hell is Otis Jenks?

08:08.446 --> 08:11.115
Otis Jenks was one of my friends
in third grade.

08:11.199 --> 08:13.367
He had great big ears
and big glasses on his face.

08:13.451 --> 08:14.452
(revving)

08:15.119 --> 08:15.953
What...

08:16.954 --> 08:19.290
-That's my Norton.
-Your Norton was stolen two years ago.

08:19.373 --> 08:21.000
Don't tell me I don't know my own bike.
That's my Norton.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.294
-Renko--
-Come with me. Come with me!

08:23.377 --> 08:25.338
-Come with me! Come with me!
-Okay! Okay!

08:25.421 --> 08:27.590
RENKO: Get off the car! Get off my car!

08:27.673 --> 08:29.842
That's my Norton, I know it!

08:30.968 --> 08:33.179
WOMAN: So, let's see this stuff. Hey.

08:33.262 --> 08:34.639
(motorcycle engine revving)

08:34.722 --> 08:37.433
Hey! We doing business here or what?

08:37.517 --> 08:39.810
-Yes, patience, <i>muchacha.</i>
-Come on, I'm busy.

08:40.394 --> 08:43.981
Please, don't insult Carmello.
This stuff's 85 percent pure, huh?

08:44.440 --> 08:45.691
Final offer.

08:46.943 --> 08:49.737
I'm telling ya,
I'm too soft for this business.

08:56.786 --> 08:59.872
Carmello would really like
to party with you sometime!

09:01.290 --> 09:04.752
Okay, guy in the long maroon coat,
he's got my bills.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.261
(tires screech)

09:14.303 --> 09:15.805
You're under arrest. All right.

09:16.764 --> 09:18.808
-On the top of the car.
-It was that chick, right?

09:18.891 --> 09:21.269
-She's a narc, huh?
-Get them up there, sport.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.563
I'm telling you, man.

09:23.646 --> 09:24.730
PATRICK:
Come on, let's go. Hands on the hood.

09:24.814 --> 09:27.316
-Hey! Okay, okay, okay.
-Come on.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.318
-What have we got?
-Blinded by ta-tas.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.404
Yo, Lucy, you seen a motorcycle?

09:31.487 --> 09:33.573
-What motorcycle?
-RENKO: A Norton, a big Norton.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.950
Purple stripe on the tank?
(indistinct)

09:36.033 --> 09:38.619
-RENKO: You got it. Now, where'd it go?
-Turn on Naga, head north.

09:39.036 --> 09:41.289
This guy's a righteous citizen.
Take care of him.

09:41.372 --> 09:44.458
-(indistinct)
-You heard the man, huh?

09:44.625 --> 09:46.294
-Watch your noggin.
-Whoa.

09:46.377 --> 09:48.713
Okay, men. That's the spirit, Shuster.

09:48.796 --> 09:51.382
-Yeah, going good, Lieutenant.
-Sixty percent pure.

09:51.465 --> 09:54.302
Sixty percent? Come on,
that stuff's better than that.

09:54.385 --> 09:58.723
That's 6.4 grams at 60 percent...

10:00.891 --> 10:03.019
Five-hundred 72 dollars.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.646
Five-hundred and 72.

10:08.899 --> 10:09.900
Lieutenant?

10:10.943 --> 10:13.195
Yeah, you getting everything
you need there, Wally?

10:13.279 --> 10:15.823
I know a court room evidence bag
when I see one.

10:15.906 --> 10:18.326
This dope came
from your own property cage.

10:18.409 --> 10:21.412
You can even see the staple marks
where the evidence tag has been removed.

10:21.495 --> 10:22.330
No. (sniffs)

10:24.707 --> 10:26.125
Looks like you're right, Wally.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.252
Dede, you put this back
where it came from,

10:28.336 --> 10:30.129
and you report to my office immediately.

10:30.212 --> 10:31.922
-Yes, sir.
-(whispers) I thought it would work.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.215
-Uh-huh.
-(clears throat)

10:34.175 --> 10:39.221
Uh, you can understand
the men are a little excited is all.

10:39.513 --> 10:41.015
Friendly scales now, Wally.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.437
Black tar heroin.

10:47.188 --> 10:49.023
Glut on the market at present.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.983
Book value way down.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.322
Little lady's name is Walter Panavich.

10:56.405 --> 10:58.991
Caught her dealing outside
of cut-rate lingerie store.

10:59.075 --> 11:02.411
(low voice) Come on, give a guy
some credit. It's a marketing gimmick.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.704
I'm straighter than you.

11:03.996 --> 11:05.873
I'll take the merchandise
to weigh-in, lover.

11:05.956 --> 11:06.957
Mm.

11:11.003 --> 11:13.464
Neal, how many times do I have to tell you
lavender is not your color?

11:13.547 --> 11:14.799
Stop!

11:16.676 --> 11:19.303
I'm telling you the truth, people.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.472
LUCY: Yeah? If you're such
a big snitch with Division,

11:21.555 --> 11:23.641
what are you doing out there
dealing on the street?

11:23.724 --> 11:24.975
Well, you know about the economy.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.603
Man's gotta have two jobs
to make ends meet.

11:27.853 --> 11:30.356
-(chuckles)
-Phone call won't hurt, Luce.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.067
Come on, Captain Hartman
will vouch for me, I swear.

11:33.150 --> 11:35.444
You can let me off with a warning, huh?

11:38.406 --> 11:40.741
I got no time for this, Sid,
will you file a report?

11:40.825 --> 11:43.411
If only life were that simple,
but some of what was stolen

11:43.494 --> 11:46.038
wouldn't look particularly wholesome
in a police report, you know?

11:46.122 --> 11:48.374
Hey, hey, hey,
you wasting my time to tell me

11:48.457 --> 11:50.918
that somebody took some hot goods
from your place?

11:51.001 --> 11:53.504
-I was holding it for somebody.
-Drop off the earth, Sid.

11:53.587 --> 11:55.631
Wait a minute. Don't you want
to hear the explanation, Norm?

11:55.715 --> 11:56.549
I got to pull it--

11:56.632 --> 11:59.343
Um, Lieutenant,
weekly 147 report, Lieutenant.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.262
-(Norman clears throat)
-(paper rustles)

12:02.096 --> 12:03.556
Raymond, you've been
doing this job long enough.

12:03.639 --> 12:05.015
Show some initiative, huh?

12:06.016 --> 12:07.059
Norm--

12:07.143 --> 12:08.436
Look, I am gonna close
my eyes now, Sidney.

12:08.519 --> 12:11.021
And when I open them up,
you are gonna be a thing of the past.

12:11.105 --> 12:13.065
-Why? What--
-Right there.

12:14.024 --> 12:16.902
-Come on, what is this? Norm.
-Out, Sid.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.779
I understand you're in charge, Lieutenant.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.990
-Yeah.
-I'm working with PMR. My name is--

12:21.073 --> 12:22.533
You're in charge? Excuse me.

12:22.616 --> 12:24.118
You've made it to the top, Norm,
is that what I'm hearing?

12:24.201 --> 12:26.328
-Goodbye, Sid.
-I knew that you could do it.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.789
It's only fair.
It's only what you deserve.

12:28.873 --> 12:31.333
Sidney Thurston
always backs the right horse.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.835
-Congratulations.
-Out now.

12:32.918 --> 12:33.919
Yeah, sure, right.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.713
Is this the way you're gonna
treat the little people?

12:35.796 --> 12:37.089
The friends who helped you
get where you're going?

12:37.173 --> 12:38.007
Get out.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.134
-All right. Think about it.
-Out. Now.

12:40.217 --> 12:42.178
He's just, uh, he's just some creep.

12:42.261 --> 12:43.596
Now, so, uh, you were saying?

12:43.679 --> 12:46.474
Planning and research division.
I'm consulting for them.

12:46.557 --> 12:49.268
I'm Lori Tuttle, design efficiency expert.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.103
I'll need a couple of hours with you

12:51.187 --> 12:53.230
to go over color schemes,
swatches, floor plans.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.775
Whoa, uh, we're a little busy today.

12:55.858 --> 12:59.820
It's a prototype study, Lieutenant.
How color influences environment.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.238
Design determines decision.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.574
Uh, Sergeant Hunter, uh,
could you come here a minute?

13:03.866 --> 13:06.744
-This is, uh...
-Lori Tuttle.

13:06.827 --> 13:08.037
-We've met.
-Good.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.747
Take care of her, Sergeant, all right?

13:11.832 --> 13:13.918
Shall we start with the tour, Miss Tuttle?

13:15.836 --> 13:18.631
Uh, Lieutenant, have you reviewed
the Panavich bust this morning?

13:18.714 --> 13:20.466
I've been a little busy, Miss Davenport.

13:20.549 --> 13:24.094
You tell me, where Detectives LaRue
and Washington have probable cause

13:24.178 --> 13:26.639
to search the purse
Mr. Panavich was carrying?

13:27.014 --> 13:29.141
(sighs) Looks murky.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.976
Murky? Try outrageous.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.436
-I intend--
-Raymond.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.814
-Sir?
-Kick Mr. Panavich.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.357
Yes, sir.

13:37.066 --> 13:40.528
Hate to waste tax-payer's money
on bad police work. Anything else?

13:47.618 --> 13:50.204
Carmello, bad news.

13:51.413 --> 13:53.123
What did Captain Hartman say?

13:53.207 --> 13:54.625
His exact words...

13:55.292 --> 13:58.170
"Carmello's a hump. Let him rot."

13:58.963 --> 14:02.049
Cops, they break your heart every time.

14:02.132 --> 14:04.385
(chattering)

14:05.135 --> 14:07.680
(siren wailing in distance)

14:19.608 --> 14:21.068
Hold it! Police!

14:23.487 --> 14:24.780
(growls)

14:30.619 --> 14:32.538
-(growls)
-Fetch!

14:34.623 --> 14:36.375
MICK: Okay, kid, hold it right there.

14:39.044 --> 14:40.337
I said hold it!

14:41.088 --> 14:42.673
Okay, kid.

14:44.925 --> 14:46.093
(grunts) Come here!

14:46.760 --> 14:48.721
What are you doing? I'm a police officer.

14:48.804 --> 14:52.057
-Let me go, garbage face!
-Get down there.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.434
(screams)

14:53.934 --> 14:54.810
(grunts)

14:55.769 --> 14:57.187
You bit me!

14:57.438 --> 14:58.439
(grunts)

15:01.817 --> 15:03.152
Thirty-five seconds.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.697
-Forty.
-They're slipping.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.532
Used to be we'd have got the call by now.

15:08.616 --> 15:11.535
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Attention, units, vicinity 418 Hudson.</i>

15:11.619 --> 15:14.663
<i>Caller reporting sounds of a struggle.</i>
<i>Apartment 102.</i>

15:14.747 --> 15:16.957
They left out the woman screaming.

15:17.291 --> 15:20.169
Detectives Washington
and LaRue responding.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.298
-(knocking on door)
-J.D.: Police, open up!

15:24.381 --> 15:25.758
We got a report someone's hurt.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.092
MAN: Come on!

15:27.176 --> 15:28.928
The fight must be in the other room, Neal.

15:29.011 --> 15:31.347
All right, gentlemen, hands up!
Come on! Let me see the hands!

15:31.430 --> 15:33.307
-(metal clanking)
-God rest my soul, Neal,

15:33.390 --> 15:34.642
it's Stevie Doran.

15:34.725 --> 15:37.019
Uh-huh. Must have stuffed the victim
in the closet.

15:37.102 --> 15:39.730
Neal, I believe there are controlled
substances on the premises.

15:39.813 --> 15:41.982
-You ain't got no warrants!
-Warrants?

15:42.066 --> 15:45.861
We're answering a distress call.
Oh, oh, oh, my, look it.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.237
A cocaine burrito.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.239
This will never hold up, you scum wad!

15:49.323 --> 15:51.158
Your friend suffer
from high blood pressure?

15:51.241 --> 15:52.826
-Huh, Stevie?
-Come on.

15:52.910 --> 15:56.747
I've often felt that a camouflage motif
would fit nicely in here.

15:56.830 --> 15:58.540
By the way, Miss Tuttle,

15:58.624 --> 16:01.961
did I mention that I designed
the... (indistinct) uniform?

16:02.294 --> 16:04.380
-Several times, Sergeant.
-All right.

16:04.463 --> 16:07.299
-Last name.
-I already gave you this.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.051
Spell it.

16:09.593 --> 16:11.011
Brazoni.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.180
B-R-A-Z-O-N-I.

16:13.263 --> 16:14.848
(typewriter clacking)

16:16.183 --> 16:18.769
-First name.
-Fetch.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.816
-You got a dog's first name?
-That's what they call me.

16:23.899 --> 16:26.110
Something to do with biting people maybe?

16:26.944 --> 16:28.654
What's your real first name?

16:28.737 --> 16:31.156
Louis. Louis Brazoni Junior.

16:33.450 --> 16:36.328
How's Louis Senior gonna take
the news we got you down here?

16:36.412 --> 16:39.039
-Let me know when you find him.
-(telephone rings)

16:41.125 --> 16:42.751
Detective Belker.

16:46.588 --> 16:48.757
That's right, Mrs. Brazoni.

16:49.091 --> 16:51.677
You gotta come down here
to sign your son out of custody.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.806
Well, what time do you get off
work at the diner, Mrs. Brazoni?

16:55.889 --> 16:57.599
You don't get off work until six o'clock?

16:57.683 --> 16:59.059
Can I talk to her?

17:02.980 --> 17:03.897
Hi, Ma?

17:04.773 --> 17:05.733
It's nothing.

17:07.526 --> 17:08.902
Don't worry about me, okay?

17:08.986 --> 17:10.237
I'll be fine.

17:11.071 --> 17:12.489
Did you take your Empirin?

17:13.490 --> 17:14.575
You mind?

17:15.743 --> 17:17.077
You ran out of medicine?

17:17.578 --> 17:19.538
Sure you just didn't leave it
in the kitchen?

17:20.372 --> 17:21.540
You do that a lot.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.083
Yes, you do, Ma.

17:24.418 --> 17:25.878
Now, listen, tell that creep Robinson

17:25.961 --> 17:28.005
not to make you work
on the busiest tables.

17:28.505 --> 17:29.757
Gotta take time off your feet.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.968
Okay. Me too.

17:35.012 --> 17:37.931
So, what do I do till six,
make license plates?

17:38.015 --> 17:39.683
(chattering)

17:42.728 --> 17:43.645
J.D.: Well?

17:46.732 --> 17:49.860
-Forty-four thousand two hundred.
-Hey, hey, hey!

17:49.943 --> 17:51.779
-We got a new total, folks.
-(chattering)

17:51.862 --> 17:55.908
$44,200.

17:55.991 --> 17:58.077
-(cheering)
-Thank you, thank you.

17:58.160 --> 18:01.038
Ladies and gentlemen,
overtime pay, here we come.

18:01.121 --> 18:03.040
MAN: All right! Yeah! Good.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.503
I understand you got
a special detail this afternoon.

18:07.586 --> 18:11.840
Yeah, I got a 406 on Dekker at 1300 hours.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.300
Thirteen-hundred?

18:17.554 --> 18:20.265
-704 for you to sign, Lieutenant.
-Oh, good.

18:21.725 --> 18:22.810
Down here, sir.

18:24.353 --> 18:25.938
Yeah, I-I can read.

18:27.523 --> 18:30.651
-Uh, Lieutenant.
-Inspector Scapizzi.

18:31.568 --> 18:33.779
-You got a minute?
-Yeah, sure.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.870
(sighs) Look, if this is about all
the activity in the street--

18:41.954 --> 18:44.748
You met a Miss Tuttle
this morning, Lieutenant?

18:44.832 --> 18:47.543
(scoffs) Ditz with all the wallpaper
swatches, yeah.

18:47.626 --> 18:50.546
I, uh, got her the job.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.008
Of course. What do I know
about interior design, right?

18:55.092 --> 18:57.094
I mean, she's probably real good
at what she does.

18:57.177 --> 18:58.929
Ooh, she is. Yeah.

18:59.429 --> 19:02.516
I met her a few weeks ago,
and she's very...

19:03.308 --> 19:04.226
impressive.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.937
So, how can I help you, Inspector?

19:07.521 --> 19:11.108
Well, Lori-- Miss Tuttle,
called me this morning.

19:11.191 --> 19:12.526
And she was a little teed off

19:12.609 --> 19:15.195
because she wasn't dealing with
the man in charge.

19:15.279 --> 19:18.157
I sort of promised her
she'd be given priority.

19:23.412 --> 19:24.246
Listen...

19:25.164 --> 19:27.040
we hardly know each other at all, Norm,

19:27.124 --> 19:30.627
but if you just gave her
an hour or so of your time,

19:30.711 --> 19:31.670
it would mean a lot to me.

19:31.753 --> 19:35.382
And it could mean
a lot to you too someday.

19:35.883 --> 19:36.925
Capisce?

19:38.093 --> 19:39.761
Say no more, Inspector.

19:44.141 --> 19:48.187
Oh... forget interior design, Lieutenant.

19:50.355 --> 19:51.815
We're talking architecture.

19:52.232 --> 19:53.525
(door opens)

19:54.234 --> 19:56.695
BOBBY: Come on, cowboy,
let's just get back to the station

19:56.778 --> 19:59.698
and log all this junk in, okay?

19:59.781 --> 20:01.158
Oh, my Lord, that's my bike.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.036
(tires screeching)

20:05.871 --> 20:07.206
That's my bike!

20:08.123 --> 20:09.958
Man, don't change please, light.

20:10.042 --> 20:13.378
Ugh! Do not change. Please don't change.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.839
-(gun cocks)
-Hey, dude, that's my bike!

20:18.050 --> 20:19.718
-Thank you, Sergeant.
-MAN: Yes, sir.

20:22.346 --> 20:25.849
-(door opens, closes)
-Uh, Lee Taylor is next.

20:26.391 --> 20:29.770
-I'll call him.
-Oh, just a moment, Lieutenant.

20:30.729 --> 20:33.315
First, I want to pass on
this conversation I had

20:33.398 --> 20:35.275
-with Chief Daniels.
-Concerning?

20:35.859 --> 20:37.736
Well, you saw that Sunday magazine piece

20:37.819 --> 20:40.989
about how we're falling short
on minority promotions?

20:41.073 --> 20:44.660
Only three Blacks have made lieutenant
in the past two years.

20:45.118 --> 20:48.038
Well, chief's pretty upset
about that situation.

20:48.121 --> 20:51.083
Translation, Daniels wants
the press off his back.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.292
Where are you going with this, Mike?

20:53.543 --> 20:55.254
Lee Taylor is a good man.

20:55.671 --> 20:59.591
He also has the highest written score of
any minority candidate we're seeing today.

20:59.675 --> 21:02.261
Are you suggesting we give Taylor
special consideration?

21:03.262 --> 21:04.554
What is this, Frank?

21:04.805 --> 21:07.307
Your departments subversive
gonna cause trouble again?

21:07.391 --> 21:08.976
I think it's a legitimate question.

21:10.143 --> 21:14.273
All right. All I'm saying
is I think you'll be impressed.

21:14.898 --> 21:16.024
Okay? Huh?

21:20.654 --> 21:23.365
But it wouldn't hurt to keep
the big picture in mind, Frank.

21:25.409 --> 21:26.576
Sergeant Taylor.

21:29.871 --> 21:33.000
Ah, every lunch break should be like this.

21:33.500 --> 21:36.753
-It's a great way to diet.
-I'm still starving.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.839
Come here. Come here.

21:38.922 --> 21:40.173
Come here.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.592
(moaning)

21:45.178 --> 21:47.597
Patrick. Patrick!

21:48.890 --> 21:50.767
We gotta get back out on the street.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.187
-We'll never make our quota.
-Work!

21:55.022 --> 21:56.356
Work! Work!

21:56.940 --> 21:57.816
Ugh!

21:59.526 --> 22:01.528
Hey, listen, how about a movie tonight?

22:03.322 --> 22:04.156
I told you no.

22:04.239 --> 22:06.408
How come you don't wanna be seen with me?

22:08.535 --> 22:09.494
Patrick.

22:09.578 --> 22:13.874
You know, maybe-maybe I should play
a little harder to get, huh?

22:14.291 --> 22:16.084
Respect myself.

22:16.668 --> 22:18.462
I mean, I could go out with individuals

22:18.545 --> 22:20.797
who don't mind being seen
with me in public.

22:20.881 --> 22:21.882
Maybe you oughta.

22:22.591 --> 22:23.967
I'm just kidding around.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.970
I just don't think
it's such a great idea for us to...

22:28.013 --> 22:28.889
be seen together yet.

22:28.972 --> 22:31.058
Cops go to the movies together
all the time.

22:31.141 --> 22:33.018
It doesn't mean anything.

22:33.101 --> 22:35.103
Isn't it a nice day out, Patrick?

22:35.812 --> 22:37.522
-So sunny.
-Yeah.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.025
Okay.

22:43.653 --> 22:44.821
That's good, huh?

22:47.032 --> 22:48.033
What'd you say is in it?

22:49.326 --> 22:50.952
This is anchovies and cream cheese.

22:52.162 --> 22:54.581
So, what's the deal,
this nice guy routine?

22:55.707 --> 22:58.043
Somebody bites me, I take an interest.

22:58.126 --> 23:01.254
-Right.
-This guy you work for, Demetrius.

23:02.047 --> 23:04.466
You keep running with him,
you're gonna wind up dead, kid.

23:04.549 --> 23:07.260
Oh, I get it. You want to setup Demetrius.

23:07.636 --> 23:10.097
Well, let's get something straight.
I'm no rat.

23:10.514 --> 23:11.932
Demetrius may be cheap,

23:12.307 --> 23:14.393
in fact, I know
he's holding out on me, but--

23:14.476 --> 23:18.522
Look, Demetrius is the bad guy.
I'm the good guy.

23:18.605 --> 23:20.941
It's time you started
learning the difference.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.778
Help me nail him. I can help you.

23:24.861 --> 23:26.696
Yeah, how? You gonna give me money?

23:26.780 --> 23:28.365
No, I'm gonna help you in court.

23:28.448 --> 23:30.283
I'm a juvenile. They can't touch me.

23:30.367 --> 23:34.121
They can if I add assaulting
a police officer to the charges, kid.

23:34.204 --> 23:35.247
I'm no rat.

23:35.789 --> 23:38.250
No, you're not.
You're a dog. You bite people.

23:38.333 --> 23:40.919
Color of neon will dramatize
the urban spectrum

23:41.002 --> 23:44.714
of crime and violence of life.

23:45.715 --> 23:48.051
-Your input, Lieutenant?
-My input?

23:48.135 --> 23:50.512
-Keep it a police station.
-(chuckles)

23:50.595 --> 23:52.848
Michelangelo designed a bathroom.

23:53.473 --> 23:55.934
Uh, you lost me.

23:56.226 --> 23:59.187
We must shed our preconceptions
about space.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.189
I mean, when Michelangelo
looked at a bathroom,

24:01.273 --> 24:02.524
he didn't see a bathroom.

24:02.607 --> 24:05.652
-He saw opportunity.
-Do you want to see our bathrooms?

24:06.111 --> 24:10.198
Is it all women or just me
you refuse to take seriously, Lieutenant?

24:10.949 --> 24:13.577
I was, uh, being serious.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.663
You're wanted in
interrogation A, Lieutenant.

24:16.746 --> 24:17.956
Great. Excuse me.

24:20.709 --> 24:23.336
You're done! You're over! Both of you!

24:23.420 --> 24:25.172
Careful, Winston, you're gonna stroke out.

24:25.255 --> 24:26.465
-Yeah?
-You got a problem?

24:26.548 --> 24:28.008
You got a disaster, Buntz.

24:28.091 --> 24:30.552
We busted a dope dealer, Lieutenant.
This guy was with him.

24:30.635 --> 24:33.930
Winston. Detective, first grade.
You can check me out with Division.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.516
Your playmates here stiffed a call.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.602
-A rookie stunt
-All right, slow down.

24:38.685 --> 24:41.605
They made a phony distress call
and answered it themselves.

24:41.688 --> 24:43.064
-Is that right?
-Yes, sir.

24:43.565 --> 24:45.150
-I'm shocked.
-Cut the crap, Buntz.

24:45.233 --> 24:46.526
Yeah, I know all about you.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.445
And I know what's going down here today.

24:48.528 --> 24:50.197
And your butt is gonna be in a sling!

24:50.280 --> 24:52.073
All right, you lighten up, Winston, huh?

24:52.491 --> 24:54.951
Kick him with the dealer.
Make it look right.

24:55.035 --> 24:57.787
Yeah, I got a major action
going down this afternoon.

24:57.871 --> 25:01.374
And if you clowns have screwed it up,
I'm coming back here for your badges!

25:01.750 --> 25:03.001
Jeepers.

25:03.084 --> 25:04.336
-(door opens)
-Yeah?

25:05.128 --> 25:06.379
(telephone ringing)

25:07.172 --> 25:09.257
We haven't finished
our conversation, Lieutenant.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.468
For now we have. I'm very busy, all right?

25:12.719 --> 25:15.972
Assuming you've never seen
an injunction before, Lieutenant,

25:16.056 --> 25:18.266
I'm going to explain
exactly what this means.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.352
It's obvious from this morning's cases

25:20.435 --> 25:22.521
that you have condoned
a systematic pattern

25:22.604 --> 25:24.397
of illegal searches and seizures.

25:24.481 --> 25:26.525
-I merely informed the men--
-In signing this,

25:26.608 --> 25:29.402
Judge Walton calls the evidence
against you overwhelming.

25:29.486 --> 25:31.863
-Look--
-Further arrests without probable cause

25:31.947 --> 25:34.699
could lead to criminal charges
and punitive damages

25:34.783 --> 25:37.327
of no less than $1,500 per incident.

25:37.410 --> 25:40.705
-(scoffs)
-In short, Lieutenant, the circus is over.

25:40.789 --> 25:43.083
We have a situation, Miss Davenport.

25:43.166 --> 25:46.127
I know all about
your situation, Lieutenant.

25:46.211 --> 25:49.130
But the Bill of Rights wasn't invented
for your convenience.

25:52.467 --> 25:55.053
Looks like you have
plenty of time now, Lieutenant.

25:55.971 --> 25:57.264
(sighs)

26:00.392 --> 26:03.562
FRANK: Uh, let's take
another hypothetical, Sergeant.

26:03.645 --> 26:06.940
You have an officer close to retirement
who's become unproductive.

26:07.023 --> 26:09.150
One day he shows up
with liquor on his breath.

26:09.234 --> 26:11.570
-What do you do?
-You say he's nearing retirement?

26:11.653 --> 26:15.073
Well, a young guy like me in charge,
he's not gonna be so receptive.

26:15.657 --> 26:17.576
That might be a problem
for you at your age.

26:17.659 --> 26:19.119
It's a tough situation.

26:19.661 --> 26:20.495
I agree, Sarge.

26:20.579 --> 26:21.997
HENRY: But how would it
shake down at the station?

26:22.080 --> 26:24.207
Guy like that freeloading.
Probably drunk to boot.

26:25.166 --> 26:27.460
I had this partner once
who liked to slack off.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.588
And it made my job twice as hard.

26:29.671 --> 26:32.132
So what you're suggesting
is that most likely this officer

26:32.215 --> 26:35.093
would be dumping work off
onto others which would cause...

26:36.052 --> 26:38.930
-bitterness, lower morale.
-Yes, sir, that's right.

26:39.014 --> 26:41.182
What would you do to remedy the situation?

26:41.266 --> 26:42.559
Well, I could try talking to him.

26:42.642 --> 26:45.812
You mean put pressure on him
with disciplinary measures?

26:45.895 --> 26:48.898
Yes, sir, I guess I could threaten
to discontinue the guy's pension.

26:49.941 --> 26:50.775
It's a good thought.

26:50.859 --> 26:53.903
But why give the guy
a black mark unnecessarily?

26:53.987 --> 26:55.572
Why not suggest counseling first?

26:56.031 --> 26:57.115
Well, I-I guess I...

26:58.199 --> 26:59.367
I could do both.

27:00.201 --> 27:03.288
First counseling, then disciplinary action
if that didn't work.

27:03.371 --> 27:06.625
Well, we've already kept you
ten minutes over, Sergeant.

27:07.459 --> 27:10.920
I wanna thank you for your patience,
and the results will be up tonight.

27:11.546 --> 27:12.422
Thank you, sir.

27:14.758 --> 27:16.968
SERGEANT: Next candidate, Lieutenant?

27:18.011 --> 27:18.845
(door opens, closes)

27:18.928 --> 27:21.514
WALLY: Sorry, Lieutenant,
really thought you were gonna make it.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.058
It ain't over.

27:23.141 --> 27:25.018
We got you till the end
of the shift, Wally.

27:25.101 --> 27:27.479
You keep your butt screwed to that chair.

27:27.562 --> 27:30.607
(indistinct chatter)

27:30.690 --> 27:34.444
Wanton violation of rights.
We didn't violate any rights.

27:34.527 --> 27:36.237
Apparently, we're the only ones
who didn't.

27:36.321 --> 27:38.531
Well, let's go back to the street
and make some more good busts.

27:38.615 --> 27:42.452
Yeah, $30,000 worth in three hours?
I don't know about that.

27:43.036 --> 27:45.330
If you think you can just
dodge me all day, you're wrong.

27:45.413 --> 27:47.707
-No, you're wrong, lady.
-I was promised access.

27:47.791 --> 27:51.711
Hey, access this, Miss Tuttle.
You are out of my life! Raymond!

27:52.128 --> 27:56.341
Raymond, you see to it that Miss Tuttle
here gets shown around the station, okay?

27:56.424 --> 27:57.759
She needs coffee, you get her coffee.

27:57.842 --> 27:59.844
She needs to get in somewhere,
you get her in there.

27:59.928 --> 28:01.513
But if you let her get anywhere near me,

28:01.596 --> 28:04.391
I will not be responsible
for the consequences.

28:04.891 --> 28:05.850
(exhales)

28:07.852 --> 28:11.356
Another heroic effort
sabotaged by intellectual pygmies.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.609
-(trash can lid thuds)
-SID: Excuse me, Sarge.

28:18.113 --> 28:19.739
That's life, huh, Norm?

28:19.823 --> 28:22.742
You're flying high in April,
you're shot down in May.

28:25.870 --> 28:28.373
-You just solved my problem, Sid.
-I did?

28:28.456 --> 28:30.542
Yeah. I've been wanting
to kill somebody all day.

28:30.625 --> 28:32.919
Norm, wait. I happen to be here to help.

28:33.002 --> 28:35.130
-I got a plan.
-What is it with you?

28:35.630 --> 28:36.506
For you.

28:40.093 --> 28:43.221
$40? I'm touched, Sid.
This will really help.

28:43.638 --> 28:45.473
Look at the bills, Norman.

28:45.974 --> 28:47.183
(sighs)

28:50.228 --> 28:51.563
Same serial number.

28:52.313 --> 28:53.982
-These ain't bad.
-Don't I know it.

28:54.065 --> 28:56.109
I used to have a whole steamer trunk full.

28:56.192 --> 28:58.653
This is what was stolen
from your apartment, counterfeit 20s?

28:58.737 --> 29:00.739
What do I know? Somebody talked.

29:00.822 --> 29:03.074
The point is, I can get back
to the source, Norm.

29:03.158 --> 29:06.161
Three Gs gets you 30 Gs
worth of funny money.

29:06.619 --> 29:09.205
Which nets you 30 Gs
worth of dope through me.

29:09.289 --> 29:10.915
Which puts you over the top.

29:10.999 --> 29:13.126
Of course, you gotta consider
my finder's fee in this.

29:13.209 --> 29:14.043
Don't move.

29:14.794 --> 29:18.089
Which amount you will accept
pending appraisal this afternoon.

29:18.173 --> 29:19.048
Thank you very much.

29:19.132 --> 29:21.259
Andrew J. Renko
will be there with bells on.

29:21.342 --> 29:24.471
Bobby Hill, don't ever let me say anything
bad about an insurance company again.

29:24.554 --> 29:27.766
Because once I refund that 800 bucks
they gave me when the bike was stolen,

29:27.849 --> 29:29.601
I get back the title to my Norton.

29:29.684 --> 29:33.980
And where are you gonna come up with $800
without cash overtime, hmm?

29:34.063 --> 29:35.690
Maybe I'll borrow it from Daryl Ann.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.443
(laughing) Carmello.

29:38.526 --> 29:40.278
-Hey, Sid.
-Oh, look at this.

29:40.361 --> 29:42.322
Well, judging from the circumstances,

29:42.405 --> 29:44.824
this means you don't have
the deuce you owe me.

29:44.908 --> 29:46.743
I wanted to talk to you about that.

29:46.826 --> 29:49.245
-Hey, you complaining, Stevie?
-Hey, Winston.

29:49.954 --> 29:51.956
Winston, it's me, Carmello, man.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.833
Carmello, you know this guy?

29:53.917 --> 29:56.044
-Yeah, he's a cop.
-Sit down here.

29:58.671 --> 30:01.007
Forget it, Sid.
They won't authorize the buy money.

30:01.090 --> 30:03.760
This injunction's put bugs
in everybody's shorts.

30:03.843 --> 30:06.554
It's all right, Norm. Time for plan B.

30:11.142 --> 30:12.769
This belong to you, Lieutenant?

30:13.019 --> 30:16.606
Oh, yeah, I told him he could sit outside
if he didn't bother anyone.

30:16.689 --> 30:19.108
Caught him trying to lift this
from Wally downstairs.

30:19.734 --> 30:20.819
Big deal.

30:25.615 --> 30:28.451
It's all right, Lenny, I can handle this.
Thank you.

30:29.077 --> 30:30.537
Is this where you get out the rubber hose?

30:30.620 --> 30:31.621
Shut up!

30:35.041 --> 30:39.337
So how did you pal here happen to know
who Division's gonna pop this afternoon?

30:39.420 --> 30:42.549
Carmello happens to be
an important source.

30:42.632 --> 30:44.509
Meaning he was hanging out at Division

30:44.592 --> 30:46.719
-when he overheard something.
-Exactly.

30:46.803 --> 30:49.055
Now, what I am proposing is,

30:49.138 --> 30:52.141
in exchange for terms
to be discussed, Norm,

30:52.225 --> 30:56.604
you get to use my compadre's information
to steal a major bust

30:56.813 --> 30:58.523
out from under Division's nose.

30:58.898 --> 31:01.067
I hate to say it, the guy makes sense.

31:02.110 --> 31:04.571
Winston said he had a major action
going down this afternoon.

31:04.654 --> 31:06.656
Okay, Carmello,
let's hear the where and when.

31:06.739 --> 31:09.242
Eh, eh, eh, terms, Norm.

31:10.201 --> 31:12.370
If the information pays off,
Carmello's kicked.

31:12.787 --> 31:15.081
And I get my deuce back.

31:15.164 --> 31:17.542
Plus $50 for interceding in this matter.

31:18.001 --> 31:19.460
-Okay?
-Go.

31:19.544 --> 31:20.587
The where and when.

31:21.588 --> 31:24.966
Well, I got the who.
It's Bramsen, Jaime Bramsen.

31:25.049 --> 31:27.594
Forget it, man. Bramsen's small time.

31:27.677 --> 31:30.805
I don't know, J.D. I always said
that he was connected high up.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.807
Just could never make him on anything big.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.435
All right, listen,
find Bramsen and stay on his tail.

31:35.518 --> 31:38.855
We're gonna have to have probable cause
this time around, but it's worth a shot.

31:38.938 --> 31:40.440
We're running out of cards.

31:40.523 --> 31:42.442
-All right, Lieutenant.
-Yeah.

31:43.443 --> 31:46.029
All right, listen, if you're jerking
our chains here, Carmello,

31:46.112 --> 31:49.782
you both will be making
permanent imprints in the sidewalk.

31:49.866 --> 31:52.702
Jeez, Norm, have a little faith.

31:55.288 --> 31:59.542
Ah, news of the day, 45 minutes after
downing two crullers and a large coffee,

31:59.626 --> 32:01.920
Jaime Bramsen's on the move again.

32:02.503 --> 32:03.880
I'm telling you, Neal,

32:04.339 --> 32:06.132
-Bramsen's nothing.
-(horn honks)

32:06.215 --> 32:07.842
Hey, hey, hold on, J.D.

32:14.891 --> 32:18.519
Hey, maybe that's why we could never get
nothing dirty on Bramsen.

32:18.603 --> 32:20.355
He makes his deals on the move.

32:21.022 --> 32:23.274
(tires screech)

32:25.610 --> 32:27.820
J.D.: I don't believe that van
came to a complete stop.

32:27.904 --> 32:29.697
-(police siren wailing)
-Do you, Neal?

32:34.953 --> 32:36.162
(car door closes)

32:38.539 --> 32:41.042
Police officers. Can I see
your driver's license, please?

32:41.125 --> 32:42.710
-What for?
-Running a stop sign.

32:43.211 --> 32:44.712
What's that you got in the back?

32:48.716 --> 32:49.842
You freeze, Bramsen.

32:49.926 --> 32:53.137
Looks like we found ourselves
a pharmaceutical company on wheels.

32:53.221 --> 32:56.099
-(tires screech)
-(glass shatters)

32:56.432 --> 32:58.685
Damn it! Take Bramsen now.

32:58.768 --> 33:00.728
-You're a cop.
-Yeah, and you're busted.

33:00.812 --> 33:03.231
-(siren wailing)
-(tires screech)

33:03.314 --> 33:05.650
(police siren wailing)

33:12.240 --> 33:14.158
Come on! Get out of there!

33:16.119 --> 33:17.745
-(explosion)
-Let me go, Neal!

33:17.829 --> 33:19.664
There's a half a million
dollars in dope in there.

33:19.747 --> 33:21.332
-I can get it.
-Hey, no, man, it's gone!

33:21.416 --> 33:22.625
It's gone! It's too late, man.
It's too late.

33:23.376 --> 33:24.585
Move it!

33:25.211 --> 33:27.714
Satisfied, you stupid bastard?!

33:37.348 --> 33:39.517
-Is this one an OD, Hal?
-Cocaine.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.562
You got no right to bring me here.

33:42.645 --> 33:46.441
What's the matter?
You never saw a dead body before?

33:47.316 --> 33:49.569
Plenty. Rolled a few, too.

33:50.445 --> 33:51.529
Another one, Hal.

33:53.740 --> 33:54.907
(door opens)

33:58.953 --> 34:00.371
Hey, come on.

34:00.663 --> 34:01.998
Eighteen years old.

34:02.373 --> 34:05.084
Died from hypoxia from cocaine poisoning.

34:06.878 --> 34:08.796
(rustles, thuds)

34:12.550 --> 34:13.676
(blanket rustles)

34:15.553 --> 34:17.513
Maybe you know her, too.

34:18.222 --> 34:20.808
-Does she look familiar to you?
-Hey, let me go.

34:21.100 --> 34:23.936
-Come on, the smells making me sick.
-Seventeen years old.

34:24.020 --> 34:26.189
Developed an abscess from a dirty needle.

34:26.272 --> 34:29.108
Amputated her arm.
Died of subsequent infection.

34:29.192 --> 34:31.986
-Enough!
-No, that's not enough.

34:34.197 --> 34:35.490
(blanket rustles)

34:36.032 --> 34:37.033
HAL: Burn victim.

34:38.534 --> 34:39.827
But drug related.

34:41.037 --> 34:42.955
Nineteen years old.
Nodded out on his cigarette

34:43.039 --> 34:45.541
after ingesting a variety
of narcotics and alcohol.

34:45.625 --> 34:46.918
No more!

34:47.335 --> 34:50.588
That make you feel good
about what you're doing? Huh?

34:51.422 --> 34:53.758
Does that make you feel like a man?

34:53.841 --> 34:57.345
-Stop!
-Is that the way you want to go out?

34:57.553 --> 34:59.097
I'm gonna be sick!

35:01.808 --> 35:04.644
It was in my hands, Neal, in my hands.

35:05.061 --> 35:06.395
Did all we could, lover.

35:07.188 --> 35:08.439
(chuckles)

35:08.523 --> 35:10.817
Did you catch the expression
on Winston's face? (chuckles)

35:10.900 --> 35:12.568
That was something anyway.

35:13.152 --> 35:15.488
Hey, listen, sorry what happened, guys.

35:15.571 --> 35:16.989
Hey, it was a good tip, man.

35:17.073 --> 35:19.784
You guys are terrific, you know that?
I'll tell you something.

35:19.867 --> 35:23.621
From now on when I got something,
I'm coming to you. (laughs)

35:23.704 --> 35:26.082
-Hey, Carmello.
-Hey, how you doing, Sid?

35:26.165 --> 35:31.337
Let's you and me have a friendly chat
about territorial boundary, all right?

35:31.420 --> 35:33.840
Lieutenant, could we talk
for a moment, please?

35:33.923 --> 35:36.008
I thought I made it clear
we're not talking.

35:36.342 --> 35:39.262
I won't cause you any problems. Promise.

35:40.763 --> 35:41.973
All right, come on.

35:43.683 --> 35:45.685
(telephone ringing)

35:46.435 --> 35:48.271
Oh, the work goes on, people.

35:48.521 --> 35:50.731
Detective Belker
requested backup, Sergeant.

35:53.234 --> 35:55.903
Oh, Lord, Bobby,
it's that insurance adjustor

35:55.987 --> 35:57.864
tried to hook me into
that scam with my Chevy.

35:57.947 --> 35:59.824
-What are you talking about?
-The insurance adjustment.

35:59.907 --> 36:01.200
The mechanic with the fraud.

36:01.284 --> 36:04.453
(chuckles) We meet again, Officer Renko.

36:04.537 --> 36:06.581
Harold Sturkle, Perennial Casualty.

36:06.998 --> 36:10.209
Mr. Sturkle, given the dubious
nature of our last transaction,

36:10.293 --> 36:12.545
I am appalled you have the nerve
to show up here.

36:12.628 --> 36:15.965
Oh, on the contrary. I leaped
at the chance to handle this case.

36:16.632 --> 36:19.510
Okay, it's what, $800 minus
the depreciation, right?

36:19.594 --> 36:20.469
Wrong.

36:20.553 --> 36:23.306
I did some extensive research, Officer.

36:23.389 --> 36:27.643
That Norton is now classified
as a, uh, vintage motorcycle.

36:27.727 --> 36:29.770
-Virtual museum piece.
-Well, I know that.

36:29.854 --> 36:31.230
(stutters) It's a high performance--

36:31.314 --> 36:35.359
For which full compensation
present value comes to, uh...

36:36.194 --> 36:38.029
$3,500.

36:39.113 --> 36:40.281
$3,500?

36:40.364 --> 36:42.200
Oh, problem?

36:42.283 --> 36:44.493
-You can't do this.
-We hold title.

36:44.577 --> 36:48.206
-You're trying to stick me.
-What goes around comes around.

36:48.289 --> 36:51.042
I've circulated your file.
The price is set.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.628
Mr. Sturkle,
I am gonna call your superiors,

36:53.711 --> 36:55.838
and I'm gonna tell them
what you're tried to do with my Chevy.

36:55.922 --> 36:56.839
Go ahead.

36:57.173 --> 36:59.091
Your mechanic is prepared to testify

36:59.175 --> 37:02.303
that you thought
the whole thing up yourself.

37:02.386 --> 37:05.806
Look, now, don't you think
we can make some kind of a deal here?

37:05.890 --> 37:07.183
A bribe? Officer,
are you offering me a bribe?

37:07.266 --> 37:08.726
Shut up Shut up!

37:08.809 --> 37:11.646
-I'm gonna kill you!
-Renko! Renko!

37:12.313 --> 37:14.815
I think it's time for you to leave, sir.

37:16.817 --> 37:19.153
I'll send around a truck in the morning.

37:19.737 --> 37:22.740
Oh, and, uh, have a nice day now.

37:26.494 --> 37:27.870
(whistles)

37:30.998 --> 37:32.375
What are we doing down here?

37:32.667 --> 37:33.584
(sighs)

37:34.377 --> 37:35.878
When you yelled at me, Lieutenant,

37:35.962 --> 37:38.422
no one has ever talked
that way to me before, ever.

37:38.506 --> 37:39.966
Look, things were getting
a little out of hand.

37:40.049 --> 37:41.008
I liked it.

37:42.051 --> 37:42.885
What?

37:43.344 --> 37:45.346
I'd like for you
to yell at me again, Norm.

37:47.431 --> 37:49.350
What is this, uh, some kind of move?

37:49.433 --> 37:52.270
You stirred something deep inside of me.

37:53.896 --> 37:56.732
Lady... (clears throat)
forget about it.

37:56.816 --> 37:59.026
You don't know what you're missing, Norm.

38:00.569 --> 38:02.697
Early retirement for starters.

38:05.491 --> 38:06.993
Lee Taylor.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.330
I give him a 95.

38:13.207 --> 38:14.083
What?

38:14.667 --> 38:15.960
He'll make a fine lieutenant.

38:17.336 --> 38:20.298
His answers were vague. Tentative at best.

38:20.381 --> 38:22.591
He was nervous.
He's got an excellent record.

38:22.675 --> 38:26.012
Agreed, but I don't think
this man is ready for command.

38:27.263 --> 38:30.057
And 95 is way out of line
for his performance here.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.892
You're out line, Lieutenant.

38:31.976 --> 38:33.477
Now, come on. What is it with you?

38:33.561 --> 38:36.063
I thought you were the big liberal
in the department, huh?

38:36.147 --> 38:37.690
I'm here to give fair evaluations,

38:37.773 --> 38:39.900
-not be a rubber stamp for Chief Daniels.
-Gentlemen--

38:39.984 --> 38:41.902
Oh, yeah, well, look,
nobody could ever accuse you

38:41.986 --> 38:43.821
of going out of your way
to make the department look good,

38:43.904 --> 38:44.989
now could they, Goldblume?

38:45.072 --> 38:46.949
This shouldn't be a political process.

38:47.033 --> 38:48.492
Oh, I get it.

38:49.493 --> 38:51.454
Now that you got your people in, huh?

38:51.537 --> 38:53.539
You wanna pull the ladder in
after you, is that it?

38:53.622 --> 38:54.790
-My people?
-FRANK: Cut it out.

38:54.874 --> 38:57.335
Uh, I think Taylor was nervous.

38:57.960 --> 39:00.463
And he was open to suggestions
and eager to learn.

39:00.838 --> 39:01.672
Yeah, he's a nice guy.

39:01.756 --> 39:03.674
Since when is that a criteria
for promotion?

39:03.758 --> 39:05.134
Well, if we bypass Taylor,

39:05.217 --> 39:07.428
we may just widen the gap
between Black and White.

39:08.554 --> 39:10.348
It'd discourage others from applying

39:10.431 --> 39:12.016
who might think they're not
gonna get a fair shake.

39:12.099 --> 39:14.268
So you admit this is a political process.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.062
I believe Taylor would
make a good lieutenant.

39:16.145 --> 39:18.647
I also believe this department's
lost some credibility.

39:18.731 --> 39:22.735
And I think it's our obligation
to give minorities every break possible,

39:22.818 --> 39:25.321
short of violating our own standards.

39:25.404 --> 39:27.573
And what about our obligations
to the other guys?

39:27.656 --> 39:29.033
Your score, Lieutenant?

39:29.116 --> 39:30.659
I think this warrants further discussion.

39:30.743 --> 39:33.996
As presiding officer of these proceedings,
I'm calling the vote.

39:36.415 --> 39:37.750
-Eighty.
-Frank.

39:38.417 --> 39:39.460
FRANK: Ninety.

39:40.586 --> 39:42.088
Combined with his written,

39:42.171 --> 39:45.508
that should put Taylor
right in line for promotion this year.

39:46.384 --> 39:49.428
Okay. David Dunbar.

39:49.512 --> 39:51.722
Flaherty and Sergeant Bates.
That's an affirmative.

39:51.806 --> 39:55.768
Yeah, we did it! This is gonna
put us over the top for sure.

39:56.268 --> 39:58.562
Got the champagne cooling
back at the station.

40:00.856 --> 40:01.857
(car door opens)

40:01.941 --> 40:03.901
-PATRICK: Okay, that wraps it up.
-(car door closes)

40:04.485 --> 40:08.781
-Let's head home.
-(police siren wailing)

40:14.620 --> 40:17.206
You were right about
Demetrius holding out on you.

40:17.540 --> 40:19.750
Had ten grand in cash along with the dope.

40:19.834 --> 40:21.252
Cheap, like I said.

40:21.335 --> 40:23.087
You did the right thing.

40:23.587 --> 40:24.630
So, can I go now?

40:25.548 --> 40:26.924
Yeah, you can go, Louis.

40:27.007 --> 40:29.760
-Fetch.
-Okay, Fetch.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.683
-Seventy-two percent purity.
-(clicks)

40:36.267 --> 40:39.186
-28,240.
-We're short?

40:39.270 --> 40:43.607
-Eh, we're still short.
-1,760 lousy dollars.

40:43.691 --> 40:45.901
-No, no, that's gotta be wrong.
-Come on, Wally.

40:45.985 --> 40:47.862
We're less than two grand, all right?

40:47.945 --> 40:49.947
-Give us a break here, will you?
-As much as I would like to--

40:50.030 --> 40:53.033
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you save it for your
pointy-headed friends downtown.

40:53.117 --> 40:54.702
What is it, Raymond?

40:54.785 --> 40:57.663
-You told me to take Miss Tuttle anywhere.
-Yes, right.

40:57.746 --> 41:01.375
We were in the property cage, sir,
and, well, she was measuring dimensions,

41:01.459 --> 41:03.335
and I had to move
a few boxes out of the way.

41:03.419 --> 41:05.421
And as I did, I observed her

41:05.504 --> 41:07.548
remove a few packages of evidence
behind my back.

41:07.631 --> 41:09.216
Drugs? I'm not sure.

41:09.300 --> 41:10.801
-I could be mistaken.
-Out of my way.

41:12.803 --> 41:14.180
Grab her, Sergeant!

41:14.263 --> 41:15.806
-Hey!
-Whoa, wait a minute.

41:15.890 --> 41:18.601
Whoa, that sample case
a little heavy, Miss Tuttle?

41:22.354 --> 41:23.272
Book her.

41:25.733 --> 41:27.610
Frankly, Miss Tuttle, I'm disappointed.

41:28.527 --> 41:29.653
Oh, go to hell.

41:30.237 --> 41:32.281
You think I'd fall for the same trick
again, Lieutenant?

41:32.364 --> 41:35.201
I told you, the lady stole that
from our property cage.

41:35.284 --> 41:37.536
She's being booked right now.
Which makes that fresh evidence.

41:37.620 --> 41:40.831
This cocaine has already been
counted towards your quota.

41:40.915 --> 41:42.917
You're asking me to count
the same evidence twice.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.961
It is the same drugs,
it is not the same evidence.

41:46.045 --> 41:48.464
We are talking about
two totally different crimes

41:48.547 --> 41:51.550
for which that soda happens
to be the property in question.

42:14.657 --> 42:17.117
-Three-thousand one--
-(cheering)

42:17.993 --> 42:21.914
(chanting) Wally! Wally! Wally!

42:25.834 --> 42:27.753
-We did it, Lieutenant.
-Yeah.

42:27.836 --> 42:31.215
Hey, we got our overtime pay!

42:31.298 --> 42:35.302
Yet this world is not a fair
or a kind place to all, Bobby Hill.

42:35.386 --> 42:37.263
Captain Furillo's calling, Lieutenant.

42:37.346 --> 42:40.099
Probably to congratulate you, Lieutenant.

42:40.182 --> 42:44.186
Judas, you'd think our tanks
were rolling through the streets of Hanoi.

42:44.728 --> 42:46.730
Some of the men got a little
carried away, Captain,

42:46.814 --> 42:49.316
but I think this injunction
was really uncalled for.

42:50.734 --> 42:55.573
No, sir, I never said that.
1400 hours tomorrow?

42:55.781 --> 42:58.742
(scoffs) Captain,
I'm not world's fastest typist.

43:00.244 --> 43:02.413
All right, the report
will be on your desk.

43:03.581 --> 43:05.583
-Line four, Lieutenant.
-Oh.

43:06.875 --> 43:08.544
(exhales) Lieutenant Buntz.

43:09.712 --> 43:10.796
Hello, Inspector.

43:11.922 --> 43:13.382
She gave us no choice.

43:15.467 --> 43:16.510
I know, sir,

43:16.594 --> 43:20.514
but, uh, we caught her stealing dope
from our property cage.

43:21.473 --> 43:23.642
It's hard to overlook a felony, Inspector.

43:24.893 --> 43:27.187
No, we can't. She's already been booked,

43:27.271 --> 43:29.565
and the evidence has been
logged and counted.

43:30.774 --> 43:33.485
-Well, that's not the way I saw it.
-(knocks on door)

43:33.569 --> 43:35.654
Yeah, same to you, Scapizzi.

43:36.071 --> 43:37.072
(telephone slams)

43:38.449 --> 43:40.242
Belker's bust looks solid.

43:41.994 --> 43:42.995
I just wanted you to know

43:43.078 --> 43:45.581
I'm not looking to overturn
based on the injunction.

43:47.499 --> 43:48.500
You made your quota.

43:50.002 --> 43:51.754
And you know what, Miss Davenport?

43:52.421 --> 43:54.673
I didn't see any court houses
falling down.

43:54.757 --> 43:57.134
I didn't hear any
decent citizens complaining.

43:58.844 --> 44:01.430
That's why the city
hires people like me, Lieutenant.

44:01.513 --> 44:03.432
To keep a lid on people like you.

44:06.852 --> 44:07.728
(clears throat)

44:08.562 --> 44:09.438
Goodnight.

44:12.733 --> 44:13.609
Goodnight.

44:17.154 --> 44:19.031
BOBBY: Cowboy, you gotta listen to me.

44:19.823 --> 44:20.991
RENKO: It's the only way, pal.

44:21.075 --> 44:23.827
We're talking felonious
destruction of property, man.

44:23.911 --> 44:24.745
Uh-uh.

44:25.079 --> 44:27.873
That insurance company, they don't know
what condition this bike's in.

44:28.165 --> 44:31.335
-All they know is that they recovered it.
-You are not thinking straight.

44:32.127 --> 44:32.961
Bobby...

44:34.880 --> 44:37.591
inside this machine there breathes a soul.

44:38.092 --> 44:41.845
A soul that I have given life to
through nurturing and care.

44:42.137 --> 44:46.350
People like that insurance maggot,
all they see is dollar signs.

44:46.809 --> 44:50.396
In their hands, this will suffer
neglect and abuse, and rust.

44:51.939 --> 44:53.315
I ain't gonna let that happen.

44:57.152 --> 44:59.113
(engine revs)

45:04.576 --> 45:06.745
All right, fly free, my old friend!

45:06.829 --> 45:10.040
Let the wind always whistle
through the handlebars!

45:21.719 --> 45:22.636
(keys jangle)

45:24.471 --> 45:25.639
What's wrong with me, Frank?

45:26.598 --> 45:27.933
I take stand on principle,

45:28.016 --> 45:31.103
and here I am a couple hours later
and you know what I'm asking myself?

45:31.437 --> 45:33.439
-What?
-I'm asking myself, "Am I a racist?"

45:33.522 --> 45:34.940
To which I know the answer, I think.

45:35.023 --> 45:37.234
-Which is that I'm not.
-No argument there.

45:37.693 --> 45:38.527
Yeah.

45:40.154 --> 45:42.656
I felt the pressure from Daniels,
and I resented it.

45:43.282 --> 45:44.783
Resented being told what to do.

45:45.993 --> 45:47.828
-Yes.
-Henry.

45:49.455 --> 45:53.292
Just because you're told to do something,
doesn't mean it's the wrong thing to do.

45:57.880 --> 46:00.507
-Earth to Patrick.
-What?

46:01.091 --> 46:02.092
I'm sorry. What?

46:02.426 --> 46:03.385
You feel like a movie?

46:03.469 --> 46:05.554
I was just gonna go home,
make dinner for Fabian.

46:05.637 --> 46:07.598
-We could still make the 8:00.
-I don't know, Luce.

46:07.681 --> 46:09.016
I don't feel too good.

46:09.975 --> 46:11.518
Okay, I can take a hint.

46:11.602 --> 46:13.854
Nah, really, really. I don't feel too hot.

46:14.730 --> 46:17.232
-So maybe next week we'll go.
-Absolutely.

46:18.734 --> 46:20.360
-NEAL: Hey, fellas.
-Hey, Washington.

46:20.444 --> 46:22.780
A couple of seats right here.
Hey, what's with him?

46:22.863 --> 46:24.198
Lost a friend. (whistles)

46:24.281 --> 46:25.157
-Hey, Jack.
-JACK: Yeah?

46:25.240 --> 46:27.159
Put another order
of onion rings on my tab.

46:27.242 --> 46:29.286
-JACK: You got it.
-After all, we're rich, right?

46:29.369 --> 46:30.496
Hey, that's right.

46:31.246 --> 46:32.915
Drinks all around!

46:33.624 --> 46:34.625
For everybody.

46:36.001 --> 46:38.629
A toast to Lieutenant Buntz.

46:39.338 --> 46:41.089
-Wherever he is.
-Yeah.

46:49.014 --> 46:49.973
What's this, Norm?

46:51.725 --> 46:54.061
Drinking alone on your night of triumph?

46:54.144 --> 46:55.270
(blows raspberry)

46:55.354 --> 46:56.355
There's no triumph.

46:57.314 --> 46:59.566
Furillo's gonna have
my head for breakfast.

47:00.067 --> 47:02.027
I'm in a jackpot with Scapizzi.

47:03.445 --> 47:05.572
What the heck am I wasting
my breath on you for?

47:06.240 --> 47:08.075
-Innkeeper.
-MAN: Yes, sir.

47:08.242 --> 47:11.453
A double of your 12-year-old scotch
for this man here.

47:11.537 --> 47:12.538
Coming right up.

47:13.288 --> 47:16.208
Come on, Norm. You gotta look
on the positive side of things.

47:16.667 --> 47:18.877
Today you were a hero with your men.

47:18.961 --> 47:20.504
(footsteps approaching)

47:20.587 --> 47:21.421
MAN: Here it is.

47:25.133 --> 47:26.009
Thanks.

47:27.094 --> 47:28.053
Oh, wait a minute.

47:28.470 --> 47:29.638
Let me see that 20.

47:37.396 --> 47:39.523
SID: <i>Just wanna see you happy, Norm.</i>

47:44.403 --> 47:47.406
(closing theme playing)
