00:08.600 --> 00:12.134
Delicious, Sammy. Fortunately,
I've saved room for another.

00:13.562 --> 00:16.681
Gentlemen, the keg is dry.

00:16.856 --> 00:19.607
A new keg coming out, gents.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:32.409 --> 00:35.078
We'll miss you.

00:38.206 --> 00:40.743
Do we have to do this every time?

00:40.916 --> 00:43.916
We don't have to,
it's an honour and a privilege.

00:44.085 --> 00:46.872
The keg is dead. Long live the keg.

01:01.974 --> 01:05.673
Norm? Normie, are you OK?

01:05.852 --> 01:09.765
Oh, Cliffie, I swore
it wouldn't get to me this time.

02:23.243 --> 02:26.409
I got a letter from Coach. He's in Ohio.

02:26.579 --> 02:29.366
- Why Ohio?
- Family reunion.

02:29.540 --> 02:33.122
There's some pictures
of him with everybody.

02:33.293 --> 02:38.000
- Let me see.
- That's a very attractive family.

02:38.171 --> 02:41.041
But why is everybody
but the Coach black?

02:41.215 --> 02:45.082
That's not his family.
He was sent an invitation by mistake.

02:45.260 --> 02:48.960
He didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings
by not showing up.

02:50.389 --> 02:52.760
Looks like they've accepted him.

02:52.932 --> 02:57.261
Are you kidding? He's been going
for the last six or seven years.

02:57.436 --> 03:01.184
In fact, next year
they're going to have it at his place.

03:01.356 --> 03:06.016
It says here, ''Send
my love to everybody at Cheers.''

03:06.192 --> 03:09.062
Then he signs it ''Uncle Whitey''.

03:12.406 --> 03:15.240
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

03:15.408 --> 03:19.618
- What would you like, Norm?
- A reason to live. Keep them coming.

03:20.495 --> 03:26.164
- You look a little peaky there, my friend.
- I'll be OK once my dinner settles in.

03:26.333 --> 03:30.164
- You ate at the Hungry Heifer again?
- Yes. The place is all right.

03:30.336 --> 03:33.419
I just didn't order the right thing.

03:33.588 --> 03:36.339
- I couldn't resist the muscles.
- I love seafood.

03:36.507 --> 03:40.255
No, he's a big burly waiter,
makes you shut up and eat.

03:41.886 --> 03:46.594
- Va-va-va-voom, eh, Norm?
- I beg your pardon?

03:46.765 --> 03:51.342
Hot babe at twelve o'clock.
I think it's the next notch on my bedpost.

03:51.518 --> 03:57.520
The only notches on your bedpost come
from banging your head in frustration.

03:57.690 --> 04:02.232
- Coming this way.
- I pity you married guys.

04:02.402 --> 04:05.437
- Hi, I'm Paula Nelson.
- Norm Peterson.

04:05.612 --> 04:06.893
Hi....

04:10.658 --> 04:14.868
- This smooth talker is Cliff Clavin.
- Hello, Cliff.

04:19.039 --> 04:22.242
May I buy you
and your immigrant friend a beer?

04:22.417 --> 04:25.583
- Absolutely.
- Two beers, please.

04:25.753 --> 04:28.290
I'm a reporter
for ''Boston Scene'' magazine.

04:28.463 --> 04:33.088
I'm looking for information
on the singles scene in Boston.

04:36.261 --> 04:38.881
- Have you met many women at Cheers?
- No.

04:39.054 --> 04:41.461
I haven't had much success,

04:41.640 --> 04:45.802
but how can I compete
with Cary Grant over there?

04:47.311 --> 04:49.883
I notice you're not writing.

04:50.063 --> 04:54.309
Don't waste your time
with these two geldings. Beat it!

04:56.025 --> 04:58.516
Real smooth, Cliffie.

04:58.694 --> 05:02.228
It's a good thing
she identified herself as a reporter.

05:02.405 --> 05:07.031
Otherwise, she would be
Doctor Feelgood's next patient.

05:08.076 --> 05:13.033
Cliff, how long did it take you
to create this little world you live in?

05:14.956 --> 05:17.910
If you really want the low-down
on the singles scene,

05:18.084 --> 05:20.954
talk to the owner of the bar,
Sam Malone.

05:21.128 --> 05:23.535
He'll give you
all the information you need

05:23.713 --> 05:26.038
and make you breakfast
the next morning.

05:26.215 --> 05:29.832
I've heard every pick-up line imaginable.

05:30.009 --> 05:34.053
I doubt your Mr Malone has anything
but a quote that would help me.

05:34.221 --> 05:36.794
Well, la-di-dah.

05:38.474 --> 05:41.842
Hey, good-looking,
what have you got cooking?

05:42.019 --> 05:44.972
- You must be Sam Malone.
- The one and only.

05:45.146 --> 05:49.190
- Who are you? Do you like ltalian food?
- I'm Paula Nelson.

05:49.774 --> 05:51.185
Hi, Paula.

05:51.359 --> 05:55.984
Hi. I'm writing an article on singles bars
for ''Boston Scene'' magazine.

05:56.154 --> 05:59.404
What is the major allure
of this bar for the singles crowd?

05:59.573 --> 06:02.657
You're gazing hungrily at him, honey.

06:05.286 --> 06:07.325
You're unbelievable.

06:07.496 --> 06:11.659
- I think he's got a whiff on this one.
- Not in a million years.

06:11.833 --> 06:15.367
Would you say ''Cheers''
is known as a singles bar?

06:15.544 --> 06:20.003
I'll answer that question seriously
if you'll answer one of mine seriously.

06:20.172 --> 06:21.631
OK.

06:21.799 --> 06:26.459
Do you think it's possible for a man
to satisfy a woman too much?

06:26.636 --> 06:29.007
In my two weeks of research,

06:29.179 --> 06:33.258
you're the first man to hit on me
so relentlessly l've ended the interview.

06:33.432 --> 06:36.433
- You should have come to me first.
- Excuse me.

06:36.601 --> 06:39.139
- You're not leaving, are you?
- Sam, dig it out.

06:39.312 --> 06:41.719
Come on, you can do it, babe.

06:41.897 --> 06:46.605
You don't really think I meant
those juvenile come-ons, do you?

06:46.776 --> 06:50.903
- Why wouldn't l?
- Hey, you did! She did!

06:51.071 --> 06:53.110
No, I was just giving you examples

06:53.406 --> 06:56.406
of the stupid things
guys say here to pick up women.

06:56.575 --> 06:59.409
- lt's sad.
- Yeah. Well, be that as it may...

06:59.577 --> 07:01.949
Wait. lt'd be fun to help you.

07:02.121 --> 07:05.204
- You're looking for a quote?
- Don't waste my time.

07:05.373 --> 07:10.200
I always say, if it wasn't for people
who say they never go to singles bars,

07:10.377 --> 07:12.998
singles bars would be out of business.

07:13.171 --> 07:15.210
Didn't Diane say that?

07:15.381 --> 07:19.164
When you talk all the time, you're
bound to say everything eventually.

07:19.342 --> 07:22.212
- That's almost useable.
- There's more.

07:22.386 --> 07:24.793
Why don't we go up to Melville's?

07:24.971 --> 07:29.679
I'll share my thoughts on singles bars
and we'll have some bouillabaisse.

07:29.850 --> 07:33.099
Is this another come-on?
You're plying me with fish heads?

07:33.269 --> 07:37.515
No, no, I promise.
We'll just talk about the article. OK?

07:37.689 --> 07:41.140
- I do love bouillabaisse...
- I hear it's an aphrodisiac.

07:41.317 --> 07:45.266
But when I'm around,
even oxygen is an aphrodisiac.

07:45.445 --> 07:49.394
I can't believe you're not writing down
these crude come-ons.

07:49.573 --> 07:55.159
Probably the hardest part of my job
is the daily encounter with loneliness...

07:56.412 --> 07:57.870
Sammy!

07:59.122 --> 08:01.280
Put it there, Cliffie!

08:01.457 --> 08:04.244
- We're number one!
- Number one!

08:15.009 --> 08:19.136
Guys? Do you remember anything
Diane said about lmpressionism?

08:19.304 --> 08:22.755
No, but I know
she makes a bad first one.

08:22.932 --> 08:26.051
- After that, it gets worse.
- Why are you asking, Sam?

08:26.226 --> 08:29.310
I found out Paula likes
French lmpressionists,

08:29.478 --> 08:32.229
so l've got to find
some smart things to say.

08:32.397 --> 08:34.852
Yeah, she's an art buff

08:35.024 --> 08:38.143
and I'm a Paula-in-the-buff buff.

08:39.443 --> 08:42.195
Give up on this one, Sammy.

08:42.363 --> 08:45.032
I'm doing fine. We've had two dates,

08:45.199 --> 08:48.614
as long as I keep throwing out
Dianeisms, there's no problem.

08:49.368 --> 08:52.203
Haven't you had your fill
of dames like that?

08:52.371 --> 08:56.367
I thought that disaster with Diane would
have soured you on brainy women.

08:56.540 --> 08:58.580
Or women. Or life.

08:59.710 --> 09:05.165
- Listen, I want that woman, Carla. OK?
- What's so special about this woman?

09:05.339 --> 09:09.585
Well, if you must know,
it's kind of embarrassing to admit,

09:09.759 --> 09:11.834
but l've never had a reporter before.

09:13.970 --> 09:19.805
- Get out.
- Well, never a magazine reporter...

09:19.975 --> 09:25.015
...from the Boston area...
with a circulation of over a million...

09:25.187 --> 09:27.428
- Yeah, go on.
- ...lately.

09:29.274 --> 09:33.140
What's special about this one?
I don't get it.

09:33.318 --> 09:36.272
I understand it.
He wants the ones he can't have.

09:36.446 --> 09:38.936
Like this dame and me.

09:39.907 --> 09:43.738
Can't anybody think of something
Diane said about painters?

09:43.910 --> 09:46.198
She's out of your league, Sammy.

09:46.370 --> 09:51.031
Face it, you're just one of us,
one of the great unwashed.

09:54.251 --> 09:56.290
Excuse me, Sam?

09:56.461 --> 10:02.545
I was all too brief in my response
to your inquiry about CÃ©zanne.

10:04.300 --> 10:09.091
Backgrounds were very important to him,
even in his early period.

10:09.262 --> 10:13.638
Eventually however, he completely broke
with Renaissance perspective.

10:13.807 --> 10:17.507
That makes sense.
Thank you very much.

10:17.685 --> 10:20.472
But that's not the reason
his paintings looked,

10:20.646 --> 10:25.390
as you so eloquently put it,
''like he was goofed on skunk weed.''

10:27.609 --> 10:31.440
- You know what I was talking about.
- I'm not putting you down.

10:31.612 --> 10:35.775
I think your new-found interest in the arts
is completely laudable.

10:35.949 --> 10:39.483
And l'd like to think
that I had something to do with it.

10:39.660 --> 10:41.403
You did.

10:41.578 --> 10:43.985
- Keep it up, big lug.
- Thank you.

10:47.249 --> 10:50.949
Background... lmportant... Renaissance.

10:51.127 --> 10:53.700
A-l-S-S-A-N-C-E...

10:53.879 --> 10:57.212
- Perspective.
- Give up, cucumber brain.

10:58.007 --> 11:01.921
Hey, Sam, you have got a textbook.
What are you asking Diane for?

11:02.094 --> 11:04.880
It's more fun to steal than study.

11:05.638 --> 11:11.141
Anyway, it's a hot irony to use Diane's
brain to get another woman's body.

11:13.686 --> 11:16.769
I'll be in my office, studying.

11:16.938 --> 11:20.022
Diane, how about those pointillists?

11:20.191 --> 11:25.563
Oh... I think Seurat was the finest
naturalist of his time.

11:25.737 --> 11:27.812
You and me both, sister.

11:36.828 --> 11:40.327
Diane, I'm off to the fetish seminar.

11:43.458 --> 11:48.368
I was hoping for a rapprochement
before I go out of town.

11:49.254 --> 11:53.121
Frasier, I thought I had seen you
at your lowest last night

11:53.299 --> 11:56.418
when you waited until
the kiwi tarts and the demitasse

11:56.593 --> 11:59.926
to announce you were
going to yet another seminar.

12:00.096 --> 12:03.546
This is the most demanding
relationship l've ever been in.

12:03.724 --> 12:07.720
Diane, am I pronouncing this right?
Giv-er-ny?

12:07.893 --> 12:10.810
- Giverny.
- Thank you.

12:10.979 --> 12:16.316
Every time we have a discussion, it
turns into... What was that all about?

12:16.483 --> 12:20.231
Sam is developing an interest
in the lmpressionists.

12:24.322 --> 12:28.319
- Hmm, what?
- Hmm, this is suspicious.

12:28.492 --> 12:31.658
I think it's part of Sam's grand design
to win you back.

12:31.828 --> 12:34.532
Not this again.
You sound like a broken record.

12:34.705 --> 12:38.916
Now you're saying I repeat myself.
That I say things over and over.

12:43.003 --> 12:45.790
You do repeat yourself on this subject.

12:45.964 --> 12:49.083
And it's very cynical of you
not to believe

12:49.258 --> 12:53.718
that Sam is developing
a genuine appreciation for culture.

12:53.886 --> 12:57.468
I'm sorry, Diane, just one more
art question here.

12:57.639 --> 13:00.593
- What is it, Sam?
- All right. Excuse me.

13:00.767 --> 13:02.806
Now, this Rubens guy.

13:02.977 --> 13:06.345
Is this the same guy
that invented that sandwich?

13:09.398 --> 13:13.312
- No, I don't think so.
- OK. I was just wondering.

13:13.485 --> 13:18.192
The women in his paintings look
Iike they really tuck away the groceries.

13:23.492 --> 13:25.780
He'll be a curator in no time.

13:26.870 --> 13:29.787
I hate that attitude!

13:29.955 --> 13:33.999
It's obviously futile
to try to talk to you in this mood.

13:34.167 --> 13:36.206
This is the number to call me,

13:36.377 --> 13:40.160
should you be interested
in rational discourse.

13:43.591 --> 13:46.544
You'll rue the day you did that!

13:48.261 --> 13:50.882
Oh, Frasier!

13:57.184 --> 13:59.260
Diane... Oh, damn.

13:59.436 --> 14:03.018
Carla, do you remember
if Diane said anything about Renoir's

14:03.189 --> 14:05.311
''Bather Seated on a Rock''?

14:05.482 --> 14:11.270
Would you give up on that egghead?
It didn't work before, it won't now.

14:11.445 --> 14:14.445
I was different before,
this time I'll do it right.

14:14.614 --> 14:17.105
You really think it's worth all this trouble?

14:17.283 --> 14:20.900
Ever since that woman
walked in the door, l've wanted her.

14:21.077 --> 14:24.113
I won't give up just because
she thinks she's smarter.

14:24.288 --> 14:29.328
- I don't like her.
- That's quite clear, but it won't stop me.

14:35.422 --> 14:37.746
He wants me.

14:54.895 --> 14:57.017
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:58.147 --> 15:01.313
Sam, if there's anything else I can do

15:01.483 --> 15:07.436
to further stimulate and arouse
your interest in the arts, let me know.

15:08.572 --> 15:11.904
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

15:12.074 --> 15:16.450
I'm so moved by your hunger...
for knowledge.

15:20.539 --> 15:22.780
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

15:22.957 --> 15:24.996
Afternoon, everybody.

15:27.711 --> 15:30.380
So how was your meal
at the Hungry Heifer?

15:30.546 --> 15:33.666
Cliff was fussy at first,
but I think I converted him.

15:33.841 --> 15:37.209
- Really?
- Well, yeah, my steak was a little gristly,

15:37.385 --> 15:43.386
but what do you expect when they've
got a mural of the Heimlich manoeuvre?

15:43.556 --> 15:47.600
Carla, take the bar for a minute,
I have an important call to make.

15:47.768 --> 15:50.721
Cliffie had the Ton O'T-Bone.

15:50.895 --> 15:55.722
For less than four bucks you get
24 ounces of USDA choice beff.

15:55.899 --> 16:02.611
- No, you mean beef.
- Don't be ridiculous, that stuff is beff.

16:03.613 --> 16:05.771
It's a Hungry Heifer trademark

16:05.948 --> 16:10.443
for a processed, synthetic,
meat-like substance.

16:12.370 --> 16:15.702
- Oh, no.
- What do you expect for four bucks?

16:15.872 --> 16:18.078
See me complain about the loobster?

16:23.420 --> 16:29.457
Hi, this is Sam Malone. You remember
me, do you? Well, that's great.

16:29.633 --> 16:32.716
I'd like to make a reservation
for tomorrow night,

16:32.885 --> 16:34.924
but I want a particular room.

16:35.095 --> 16:40.515
Do you remember I was there with a
slender blonde who was mad about me?

16:40.683 --> 16:43.220
Yeah, I want the same room.

16:43.393 --> 16:47.721
It had a fireplace
and a deck and a hot tub.

16:47.897 --> 16:50.469
That's it.
I'd like to have that one, please.

16:50.649 --> 16:54.480
Yeah, I'm hoping it'll create
the same old magic.

16:54.652 --> 16:58.020
Yeah. Thank you,
I'll see you tomorrow night. Bye.

17:12.665 --> 17:16.709
Sammy, I hate to cast a shadow
over your good time,

17:16.877 --> 17:21.288
but who will make drinks tomorrow
while you're making whoopee?

17:21.464 --> 17:24.630
Damn. I didn't think about that.

17:24.799 --> 17:29.793
- You can handle the bar, can't you?
- Give up waiting on tables?

17:29.970 --> 17:33.718
I get my heaviest tips
in my third trimester.

17:35.641 --> 17:39.507
You think Diane's ready
to handle this by herself?

17:39.686 --> 17:45.224
What? She's a worse bartender
than she is a waitress.

17:45.398 --> 17:48.897
When you made her do it
for a couple of hours, she hated it.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.938
Well, I'll just have to ask her nice.

17:52.112 --> 17:55.314
- Well, good luck. And good night.
- Yeah, good night.

17:56.865 --> 18:00.234
Well, Sam, I guess I'll be going home,

18:00.410 --> 18:04.620
unless there's something
you'd like to talk to me about,

18:04.788 --> 18:08.488
now we're almost alone
and we have a private moment.

18:09.667 --> 18:13.366
Actually, there is something
I'd like to ask you.

18:16.297 --> 18:18.336
Ask away.

18:20.300 --> 18:24.593
You've been acting
kind of strange today. ls there...?

18:24.761 --> 18:27.964
Well, l've had something on my mind.

18:29.015 --> 18:32.098
Well, yeah, me, too.

18:32.267 --> 18:34.639
This will be pretty tough to ask you.

18:34.811 --> 18:39.021
Sam? lf it makes it any easier,
I know what you're going to ask.

18:39.189 --> 18:40.731
- You do?
- Yes.

18:40.899 --> 18:44.942
I overheard your conversation,
I couldn't help it.

18:45.110 --> 18:48.359
You're going to ask
about this weekend, aren't you?

18:48.529 --> 18:53.570
Yeah, I know the first time we tried this,
it didn't turn out too hot,

18:53.742 --> 18:56.908
but I'll take full responsibility for that.

18:58.871 --> 19:02.488
Well, I'm sure that I was at fault, too.

19:02.665 --> 19:07.658
Whatever. I think the important thing
is that it'll be better this time,

19:07.836 --> 19:10.622
now you know where everything is.

19:13.131 --> 19:15.918
Well, I suppose that's true.

19:17.009 --> 19:19.167
Yeah, I'll tell you what.

19:19.344 --> 19:23.009
If you like this weekend,
maybe we can make it permanent.

19:23.181 --> 19:25.220
What do you say?

19:26.725 --> 19:29.180
Permanent?

19:29.352 --> 19:32.138
Is that you want, Sam?

19:33.897 --> 19:39.056
I'm not making any promises. Let's just
see how the weekend goes, OK?

19:39.234 --> 19:43.017
- ls three o'clock OK? I already booked.
- I know.

19:45.572 --> 19:48.857
Sam, I'm just overwhelmed.

19:49.033 --> 19:52.199
Oh, come on.
You don't have to be nervous.

19:52.369 --> 19:57.611
After your first few drinks, you'll relax,
and I think you'll actually enjoy it.

20:01.668 --> 20:04.337
Well, it does seem to help.

20:06.463 --> 20:08.206
- Sam!
- What?

20:08.381 --> 20:12.544
Everything's going so fast.
My mind is a tumult.

20:12.718 --> 20:16.667
I feel like we're on a runaway train.
Where will it end?

20:18.097 --> 20:23.932
- l've got to think about this. I'm sorry.
- You really are taking this seriously.

20:24.102 --> 20:27.766
Don't worry, if you break anything,
I'm fully insured.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.524
- Excuse me.
- My fault.

20:49.162 --> 20:52.079
- You take it.
- No, you.

20:52.248 --> 20:54.287
Thank you.

21:08.177 --> 21:11.212
- Nice day for a trip.
- Yes, isn't it?

21:13.639 --> 21:15.927
- Where are you off to, uh...
- Paula.

21:16.099 --> 21:17.890
Diane.

21:18.059 --> 21:21.641
I'm going away with a gentleman
for the weekend.

21:21.812 --> 21:25.559
This is a coincidence, so am l.

21:25.731 --> 21:28.685
- And you're meeting him here?
- Yes.

21:29.234 --> 21:30.728
Me, too.

21:31.819 --> 21:34.773
- Small world, huh?
- Yeah.

21:35.781 --> 21:41.615
It's my first weekend with this guy and
I just hope I'm not making a big mistake.

21:41.785 --> 21:43.824
He's got me puzzled.

21:43.995 --> 21:48.621
I start to think he's a dumb jerk
and then he says something intelligent.

21:49.625 --> 21:53.538
Well, I'm lucky,
I know mine's a dumb jerk.

21:55.087 --> 21:58.787
But we have something
that just won't die.

21:58.965 --> 22:01.634
Kinda like crab grass.

22:04.928 --> 22:07.963
That's a lovely thought.

22:09.890 --> 22:14.100
I know I may be making
the biggest mistake of my life.

22:14.268 --> 22:19.723
- I'm seeing an eminent psychiatrist.
- So am l. ls it helping you?

22:19.897 --> 22:23.312
- No, I mean romantically.
- Oh.

22:23.483 --> 22:28.607
And I may be giving
all of that up just to rekindle...

22:28.779 --> 22:34.448
...a mostly physical relationship
whose only appeal may be its danger.

22:36.160 --> 22:42.611
- Where are you going with this guy?
- To an inn on the coast of Maine.

22:42.790 --> 22:44.829
This is amazing.

22:46.334 --> 22:50.200
- You don't mean...
- Yes.

22:53.756 --> 22:56.044
- Hey, Paula.
- Sam!

22:56.216 --> 22:58.837
- lt's good to see you.
- You, too.

22:59.010 --> 23:03.303
- Ready for a trip down ecstasy lane?
- Yes, I think so.

23:03.472 --> 23:07.599
- Diane, how are you doing?
- Fine, great, great.

23:08.601 --> 23:13.226
- Really well.
- Will you be all right here by yourself?

23:13.396 --> 23:15.223
You bet.

23:15.398 --> 23:19.311
You two just go off and have nice time.

23:19.484 --> 23:21.523
OK. Thank you.

23:21.694 --> 23:26.521
If you run into any problem,
Carla knows where to reach me.

23:26.698 --> 23:29.698
- I appreciate this.
- Bye, Diane.

23:30.701 --> 23:33.191
What's with the suitcase?

23:34.746 --> 23:37.117
That's not my suitcase.

23:37.289 --> 23:40.040
Who said it was my suitcase? No, no.

23:40.208 --> 23:43.623
- lt looks like yours.
- There are a million of these around.

23:43.794 --> 23:47.494
No, this one belongs
to this gentleman. Sir?

23:49.173 --> 23:50.335
Really.

23:52.092 --> 23:57.761
Now don't leave this lying around.
Anybody could just walk right off with it.

23:57.930 --> 24:00.385
It'll never happen again.

24:05.852 --> 24:10.264
- Well, have fun, Sam.
- Yes...

24:10.439 --> 24:12.681
Thank you, I will.

24:16.402 --> 24:18.026
You!

24:24.700 --> 24:29.527
That's the most fun l've had since 1958.
