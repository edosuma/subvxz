01:42.440 --> 01:43.940
Provenza:

01:43.974 --> 01:47.677
Uh, uh, you know, Sykes, I don't
like to criticize people.

01:47.712 --> 01:49.513
But this looks like
the worst undercover operation

01:49.547 --> 01:50.914
I've ever seen!

01:50.948 --> 01:53.917
Yeah, this? Yeah,
I-I can explain all this.

01:53.952 --> 01:56.086
Mm, would that include how you
let two members of this crew

01:56.120 --> 01:57.954
go in and out of the back
without giving chase?

01:57.989 --> 02:00.356
Yes. I can explain that also,
lieutenant.

02:00.391 --> 02:01.925
Go, then,
before F.I.D. Kicks us out.

02:01.959 --> 02:04.428
All right. These five guys...
the two dead on the ground,

02:04.462 --> 02:05.996
the one in the squad car
who gave up,

02:06.030 --> 02:07.397
and the two that got away...

02:07.432 --> 02:09.500
they've been robbing
grocery stores for,

02:09.533 --> 02:10.901
I don't know, eight months,

02:10.936 --> 02:12.536
and...
and detective Miller

02:12.570 --> 02:15.940
just now, today,
asked us to follow the driver.

02:15.974 --> 02:17.541
Calling himself Donny...
probably an alias.

02:17.576 --> 02:19.610
Yeah, as maybe...
maybe... a suspect.

02:19.644 --> 02:21.145
Flynn: Well, what'd you think
they were up to

02:21.179 --> 02:22.813
when they rolled into the parking lot?
Not this.

02:22.847 --> 02:24.915
I mean, when they got out
of their vehicles

02:24.949 --> 02:26.116
with guns and masks,

02:26.150 --> 02:27.550
we knew what was
gonna happen, but...

02:27.585 --> 02:29.085
They had M-4s.

02:29.119 --> 02:30.686
We didn't want to stress them
with civilians around.

02:30.721 --> 02:32.721
Then why call for backup?
We didn't.

02:32.756 --> 02:35.423
Someone inside the store
pulled the silent alarm.

02:35.458 --> 02:37.459
Nothing she could do
about <i>that.</i>

02:37.494 --> 02:40.829
Yeah, but when you found out two guys
had gone in and out through the back,

02:40.863 --> 02:42.463
why didn't you go after them?

02:42.498 --> 02:43.664
We killed suspects,

02:43.699 --> 02:44.965
and force investigation
division

02:45.000 --> 02:46.567
said we had to wait here
for our interviews.

02:46.601 --> 02:48.102
Captain Raydor
and her crazy ideas.

02:48.136 --> 02:50.470
Anyhow, here I am.

02:50.505 --> 02:52.105
Still waiting to get
my statement!

02:52.139 --> 02:53.139
Isn't it nuts?

02:53.174 --> 02:55.508
So, assistant chief Taylor,

02:55.543 --> 02:58.077
instead of chasing after
heavily armed suspects,

02:58.112 --> 03:00.079
she was frozen here
because of...

03:00.113 --> 03:01.447
Taylor:
This is F.I.D.'S scene.

03:01.481 --> 03:03.449
We have officer-involved
shootings.

03:03.483 --> 03:05.918
Well, I have shots fired, too.

03:05.952 --> 03:08.154
And from fully automatic
weapons, sir. Oh.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.989
Now it is
a public-safety issue.

03:10.023 --> 03:13.425
Now, do you want us to go find
these two missing suspects...

03:13.460 --> 03:14.860
Or not?

03:14.895 --> 03:16.762
And... and where <i>is</i> Raydor,
by the way?

03:16.796 --> 03:18.631
She'll be here in a little bit.
How can I help?

03:18.665 --> 03:21.500
The suspect who gave up

03:21.535 --> 03:23.936
is sitting in that
patrol car over there.

03:23.970 --> 03:25.805
If we can move him downtown
right now...

03:25.839 --> 03:28.641
the suspect stays there until
force investigation takes him.

03:28.676 --> 03:30.142
That's the policy.

03:30.177 --> 03:32.812
Look, we're not starting
the clock over on major crimes

03:32.846 --> 03:34.948
just to give people new reasons
to sue us.

03:34.982 --> 03:37.884
We have to keep making
real changes.

03:37.919 --> 03:41.488
"Changes"?
What... what changes?

03:41.523 --> 03:43.156
I've got things running great.

03:43.191 --> 03:45.458
Talk to the suspect here.

03:45.493 --> 03:48.595
I'll see if I can move
F.I.D. Along.

03:51.232 --> 03:52.532
Come on.

03:52.567 --> 03:55.802
Sykes. Miller.
Come with us.

03:55.837 --> 03:58.672
Hold on.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.943
Something wrong, julio?

04:07.982 --> 04:09.950
Maybe.

04:09.984 --> 04:11.051
Provenza:
All right, buzz.

04:11.085 --> 04:12.820
What <i>haven't</i> I seen?

04:12.854 --> 04:14.955
The feed from the two security
cameras inside the store

04:14.989 --> 04:16.656
and the video
off the patrol cars.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.524
Well, make sure
that you get copies

04:18.559 --> 04:19.959
of all that stuff
from F.I.D.

04:19.994 --> 04:22.095
And don't come back here
with a bunch of excuses.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.496
Yes, sir.

04:23.531 --> 04:25.532
Sykes, who's our suspect?

04:25.566 --> 04:26.733
Sykes: Not sure.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.101
All their prints are in AFIS,

04:28.135 --> 04:29.603
but the feds
have a flag on their names.

04:29.637 --> 04:30.804
Provenza:
All right, Mike.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.071
You ask our friendly
FBI liaison

04:32.106 --> 04:34.541
what these flags are about.

04:34.575 --> 04:36.076
We have got to know
who these people are.

04:36.111 --> 04:38.079
Lieutenant, I've spent most of
the year chasing these guys...

04:38.113 --> 04:39.781
I understand, Miller,
but it's our case now.

04:39.815 --> 04:41.883
All right, Flynn.

04:45.921 --> 04:49.023
Hey. I'm Andy.
What's your name?

04:50.192 --> 04:51.959
So...

04:52.928 --> 04:55.096
...I hear you have an opening
in major crimes.

04:55.131 --> 04:58.566
Usually, Sykes, people hold off
asking for a promotion

04:58.601 --> 05:00.835
until they've done
something <i>right.</i>

05:04.807 --> 05:06.608
You gonna talk to me,
or do you want me to leave?

05:06.643 --> 05:09.244
How are they...
my friends?

05:09.279 --> 05:11.980
Not good.

05:12.015 --> 05:15.017
In fact, they'll be going
to the morgue pretty soon.

05:18.755 --> 05:21.624
Look, I'm gonna give you
something to think about.

05:21.658 --> 05:22.992
So listen to me.
Come on.

05:23.026 --> 05:24.661
Sit up.
Look at me.

05:24.695 --> 05:25.996
Look at me.

05:26.030 --> 05:28.632
Because you surrendered
your weapon

05:28.666 --> 05:31.034
and gave up, I don't want
to charge you for murder

05:31.069 --> 05:32.136
if I don't have to.

05:32.170 --> 05:34.739
What? No.
The police killed...

05:34.773 --> 05:36.741
look, look, look... you guys
killed people... not us.

05:36.775 --> 05:38.042
Hold on. Listen to me. We were
never supposed to kill anyone!

05:38.076 --> 05:39.710
Listen to me!
Listen to me!

05:39.744 --> 05:42.180
Now, in the commission
of a felony,

05:42.214 --> 05:43.781
if anyone dies,

05:43.816 --> 05:45.983
even though the police
shot them,

05:46.018 --> 05:47.685
technically that's murder.

05:47.719 --> 05:49.920
And those murders are on you.

05:49.954 --> 05:51.288
Look, I can help you.

05:51.322 --> 05:53.623
'Cause if we talk to the D.A.
Right now,

05:53.658 --> 05:54.891
and you tell him your name

05:54.926 --> 05:56.760
and the names of all
your friends,

05:56.794 --> 05:58.862
especially the ones
that got away,

05:58.896 --> 06:02.657
he'll make a deal to arrest you
just for the robberies.

06:02.782 --> 06:04.178
But we have to hurry

06:04.179 --> 06:05.034
because you're going down
to booking any second,

06:05.068 --> 06:06.769
and this is gonna be
all out of my hands.

06:06.803 --> 06:10.339
Let me arrest you
for robbery...

06:10.373 --> 06:12.041
And not murder.

06:12.075 --> 06:13.909
Let me make you a deal.

06:13.943 --> 06:15.077
What do you say?

06:18.348 --> 06:20.182
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

06:20.217 --> 06:21.284
Yeah, good.

06:21.318 --> 06:22.785
I'm gonna go get
the D.A. Now.

06:22.819 --> 06:23.319
Okay.

06:32.197 --> 06:33.364
He's ready to make a deal.

06:33.398 --> 06:35.933
But he knows me,
and he knows Sykes.

06:35.967 --> 06:37.802
So somebody else has to pretend
that they're the D.A.

06:37.836 --> 06:39.770
Who feels like pretending?
You?

06:39.805 --> 06:41.306
Yeah. Okay? Listen,
you know the routine.

06:41.340 --> 06:42.808
You don't have to say
you're a D.A.

06:42.842 --> 06:45.343
Just go through the...

06:51.718 --> 06:53.386
I got this side!

06:53.420 --> 06:55.321
I got this side!

07:35.429 --> 07:38.964
This guy wasn't killed
with an automatic weapon?

07:38.999 --> 07:41.133
I recovered six of
the seven bullets fired,

07:41.168 --> 07:42.401
all but one of which landed

07:42.436 --> 07:44.470
somewhere inside the squad car.

07:44.505 --> 07:46.773
So, yeah,
a .40-caliber handgun,

07:46.807 --> 07:49.876
which is why we're keeping
the search perimeter

07:49.910 --> 07:52.178
for the casings
to about 150 yards

07:52.213 --> 07:53.913
along these lines of sight.

07:53.948 --> 07:55.415
And we're still looking
for the missing bullet.

07:55.449 --> 07:57.450
Provenza:
The point is, agent Howard,

07:57.485 --> 08:00.754
our suspects have
fully automatic weapons,

08:00.788 --> 08:02.822
which is a federal crime, too.

08:02.857 --> 08:05.158
And since we can't get AFIS
to release their names...

08:05.193 --> 08:07.894
Their prints became classified
when you ran the guns.

08:07.929 --> 08:09.396
How come?

08:09.431 --> 08:12.099
I'm guessing the guns were taken
from a military base.

08:12.134 --> 08:13.768
This gang, they're veterans.

08:13.802 --> 08:15.169
What makes you think
these guys are soldiers?

08:15.204 --> 08:16.771
Well, they took the store
down fast,

08:16.805 --> 08:18.306
targeted unoccupied vehicles.

08:18.341 --> 08:20.108
They didn't kill
or wound anyone,

08:20.143 --> 08:22.311
and 30 minutes later,
one of them circled back

08:22.345 --> 08:24.980
and shot our suspect in the head
with a handgun

08:25.015 --> 08:26.215
from over a block away.

08:26.249 --> 08:28.050
Who can do that?

08:28.085 --> 08:30.319
Every male member of my family
served this country in uniform.

08:30.354 --> 08:32.822
My father, my son, and myself.

08:32.856 --> 08:35.890
Chief Taylor comes
from a military family.

08:35.926 --> 08:38.027
Yeah, well,
you may be shocked to hear

08:38.062 --> 08:40.263
that sometimes husbands
kill their wives,

08:40.297 --> 08:42.899
and priests don't always make
great babysitters.

08:42.933 --> 08:45.802
Come on, Miller,
what business are you in?

08:45.836 --> 08:47.837
Flynn: All right, look, if our
dead guys are really veterans,

08:47.872 --> 08:51.775
opening their military files will help
us find their heavily armed friends.

08:51.809 --> 08:54.244
All right, give me a minute.

08:55.846 --> 08:56.947
Provenza:
Come on. Come on.

08:56.981 --> 08:58.849
Get it all out, Miller.

08:58.883 --> 09:00.317
What else is bothering you?

09:00.352 --> 09:03.053
A lot of what happened today
doesn't fit this crew's M.O.

09:03.088 --> 09:05.355
They split up
to enter the store...

09:05.390 --> 09:06.924
never did that before.

09:06.958 --> 09:08.559
They hit a place
with a silent alarm...

09:08.593 --> 09:10.127
never did that before.

09:10.161 --> 09:12.162
I just thought these guys
were smarter than this.

09:12.197 --> 09:13.430
If they were really smart,

09:13.464 --> 09:15.332
they would have quit
before we got here.

09:15.366 --> 09:18.201
Flynn! Oh, captain.
You need anything?

09:18.236 --> 09:20.504
Lieutenant,
sorry to be running so behind.

09:20.539 --> 09:22.372
Could you bring me up to speed?

09:22.407 --> 09:23.507
Hold on.

09:23.541 --> 09:25.910
Flynn. Flynn.

09:25.944 --> 09:28.546
Let's make sure
all the paperwork is in order

09:28.580 --> 09:31.448
so that when agent Howard
I.D.S our victims,

09:31.483 --> 09:34.251
we can serve those
search warrants right away.

09:34.285 --> 09:36.153
Uh, I'm sorry, captain.

09:36.187 --> 09:39.155
I don't...
I don't owe you a briefing.

09:39.190 --> 09:43.126
Technically, the kid was in
F.I.D.'S custody, not ours.

09:43.161 --> 09:46.463
And as you can see, we're in a bit
of a hurry around here. Provenza.

09:46.497 --> 09:49.399
Captain Raydor was transferred

09:49.434 --> 09:52.169
from force investigation
division to major crimes,

09:52.203 --> 09:54.638
making her
your ranking officer.

09:56.307 --> 09:59.577
Effective immediately.

10:00.946 --> 10:03.080
And I need a briefing.

10:08.386 --> 10:11.422
Uh, okay.

10:11.456 --> 10:13.124
Okay, I'll give you a briefing.

10:13.158 --> 10:15.426
You're late.

10:15.460 --> 10:18.228
And you may be
the ranking officer,

10:18.263 --> 10:20.898
but I am
the incident commander.

10:20.932 --> 10:23.000
And I am not halting a search

10:23.034 --> 10:25.602
for suspects
with automatic weapons

10:25.637 --> 10:29.173
so you or anybody else
can catch up.

10:29.207 --> 10:31.342
Flynn, Sanchez.
Lieutenant.

10:31.376 --> 10:33.077
Uh, there...
there's a couple of things

10:33.111 --> 10:34.912
You don't seem to understand.

10:34.946 --> 10:38.149
One is that I am
the incident commander,

10:38.183 --> 10:39.984
and the other is English,

10:40.018 --> 10:42.086
because I've said it twice.

10:42.120 --> 10:45.923
Agent Howard, um, if you would
like to represent the FBI,

10:45.957 --> 10:48.659
we'll be getting our warrants
en route.

10:48.693 --> 10:50.528
I will ca <i>you,</i> captain,

10:50.562 --> 10:52.129
after I've made my arrests.

10:52.164 --> 10:53.631
Miller?
I may have questions.

11:00.238 --> 11:03.140
I told you we should've waited.

11:03.175 --> 11:04.675
No.

11:04.709 --> 11:06.243
This is the moment.

11:23.553 --> 11:25.418
Wasn't until we started cleaning
the store,

11:25.765 --> 11:27.399
we even knew the other two
suspects had been there.Tore

11:27.434 --> 11:28.400
and by that time...

11:28.435 --> 11:30.135
They were gone.

11:30.169 --> 11:31.737
Lieutenant provenza was mad that
we didn't chase after them,

11:31.771 --> 11:34.306
but I felt it was more important
that we stick with procedure

11:34.340 --> 11:35.907
and remain at the scene
of our action.

11:35.942 --> 11:37.776
Which was the right thing
to do, of course.

11:37.810 --> 11:41.513
Major crimes has a history
of ignoring I.A.P.D. Policy

11:41.547 --> 11:44.816
and leaving others
to deal with the consequences.

11:49.289 --> 11:52.423
Rusty.
What are you doing here?

11:52.458 --> 11:54.459
His file says
"attention: Major crimes."

11:54.493 --> 11:55.860
And this is the third time

11:55.894 --> 11:57.895
he's run away from home
this week.

11:57.930 --> 11:59.764
It's <i>not</i> my home.

11:59.798 --> 12:02.467
The foster parents that D.C.F.S. put him with...
Won't take him back.

12:02.501 --> 12:03.835
That is fine with me.

12:03.869 --> 12:04.836
They were terrible.

12:04.870 --> 12:06.270
What's the problem?

12:06.305 --> 12:08.239
Living with
complete strangers...

12:08.273 --> 12:09.807
<i>that</i> is the problem.

12:09.842 --> 12:11.742
And they were, like, telling me
what to do all day long,

12:11.777 --> 12:13.377
even, like, what I could eat.

12:13.411 --> 12:15.846
And they would turn off
the television at 9:00

12:15.880 --> 12:16.880
every night.

12:16.915 --> 12:18.882
So, you were tortured.

12:21.485 --> 12:23.286
I will take care of him.

12:25.323 --> 12:27.391
Thank you.

12:27.425 --> 12:31.261
Look, I know Brenda
was fired or whatever,

12:31.295 --> 12:33.230
but I need to speak
with <i>her</i> right now.

12:33.264 --> 12:35.867
Uh, detective Sykes.

12:35.901 --> 12:39.770
Uh, could you, uh, could you
pardon me for one moment?

12:39.805 --> 12:42.606
Sure. And I should say
congratulations, captain,

12:42.641 --> 12:44.608
on taking over major crimes.

12:44.643 --> 12:46.410
Well deserved.

12:51.917 --> 12:54.652
Look...

12:54.686 --> 12:55.920
We had a deal.

12:55.954 --> 12:58.756
I helped you guys
catch a serial killer

12:58.790 --> 13:01.392
so that you would find
my mom...

13:01.426 --> 13:03.827
not just dump me
into the system.

13:03.861 --> 13:07.930
I mean, you want to know why
people don't like the police?

13:07.964 --> 13:09.432
It's because you're all
a bunch of liars.

13:09.466 --> 13:10.766
That's why.

13:10.800 --> 13:11.900
Okay.

13:11.934 --> 13:14.336
Um...

13:16.405 --> 13:18.339
Um...

13:19.808 --> 13:21.409
Right.

13:21.443 --> 13:22.644
Rusty...

13:22.678 --> 13:24.679
We haven't been able to find
your mom yet,

13:24.714 --> 13:27.983
and you are too young
to live unsupervised.

13:28.017 --> 13:31.320
I lived unsupervised for months,
and nobody cared.

13:32.622 --> 13:33.689
I can handle it.

13:33.723 --> 13:35.858
Okay.

13:45.703 --> 13:49.840
You are a material witness
in a murder trial,

13:49.874 --> 13:51.942
which means that you
have to go to court

13:51.976 --> 13:54.678
when Philip Stroh stands trial,

13:54.712 --> 13:57.747
and you have to testify under oath about what
happened to you. No, I don't have to do that.

13:57.782 --> 13:59.983
Oh, yes, you do. And we have
to protect you until then.

14:00.017 --> 14:02.518
No, I am <i>not</i> doing that,
a <i>you</i> can't make me.

14:02.553 --> 14:04.520
Oh, yes, we can make you,
and we will make you.

14:04.555 --> 14:06.589
And until then, we need to find

14:06.623 --> 14:08.391
a safe place for you to stay.

14:08.425 --> 14:09.859
Look,
I-I-I don't know you...

14:09.893 --> 14:11.060
Really.

14:11.094 --> 14:12.761
But I don't like you.

14:12.796 --> 14:15.698
So, I'd rather just deal
with Brenda, please.

14:15.732 --> 14:17.833
Well, I'm afraid
you're standing

14:17.867 --> 14:19.935
at the back
of a very long line.

14:19.970 --> 14:23.705
Unfortunately, chief Johnson
has retired from the I.A.P.D.

14:23.740 --> 14:25.073
She is out of town.

14:25.108 --> 14:26.675
So I am who you've got.

14:26.709 --> 14:27.809
What?

14:27.843 --> 14:29.344
Um... Hold on.

14:29.378 --> 14:30.711
No, no, no, no.

14:30.746 --> 14:32.079
<i>You</i> hold on.

14:32.114 --> 14:34.315
I need to know who here
is looking for my mother.

14:34.349 --> 14:35.349
I am.

14:35.383 --> 14:37.517
I am supervising

14:37.552 --> 14:38.585
the search for your mother.

14:38.619 --> 14:40.520
And I will find her.

14:40.555 --> 14:41.588
Yes, come in.

14:41.623 --> 14:42.923
Oh.

14:42.957 --> 14:45.492
Um... Sorry to interrupt.

14:45.526 --> 14:47.728
But the lieutenants are back,

14:47.762 --> 14:49.430
and commander Taylor...

14:49.464 --> 14:52.066
assistant chief Taylor
is walking down from his office.

14:52.101 --> 14:54.102
Okay. Um...

14:54.136 --> 14:56.504
Buzz, you remember rusty.

14:56.539 --> 14:57.972
Oh.

14:58.007 --> 14:59.941
Uh... Yes. Hi.

15:01.977 --> 15:03.077
I don't know him.

15:03.111 --> 15:04.512
He works here.

15:04.546 --> 15:05.846
Um, buzz...

15:05.881 --> 15:07.448
Could you keep our guest
with you in electronics

15:07.482 --> 15:08.649
till I get child services

15:08.683 --> 15:09.850
to appoint
a more suitable guardian?

15:09.885 --> 15:12.419
No! I know how
upsetting this is.

15:12.454 --> 15:14.622
No, you can't. You put me somewhere. Listen.
But I don't have time to deal with...

15:14.656 --> 15:17.458
I can't stop now to do this. Listen to me.
No, you listen to me. Listen to me!

15:17.493 --> 15:19.761
If you put me somewhere
that is not with my mom,

15:19.796 --> 15:21.396
then I am gone.

15:21.431 --> 15:23.632
And that... that's too bad
for your trial, huh?

15:26.502 --> 15:29.938
Buzz. Electronics.
Now.

15:31.707 --> 15:33.808
Hey.

15:33.842 --> 15:35.409
Hey, I want a lawyer!

15:35.444 --> 15:37.678
I have a right to a lawyer,
don't I?

15:42.750 --> 15:43.717
I want a lawyer.

15:43.751 --> 15:44.951
Lawyers are for criminals,

15:44.986 --> 15:46.419
not witnesses.

15:46.454 --> 15:47.954
That's probably another lie.

15:47.989 --> 15:51.391
I bet you don't know
the first thing about lawyers.

15:51.426 --> 15:53.026
What kind of name is "buzz,"
anyway?

15:53.060 --> 15:56.529
You mean compared to "rusty"?

15:56.564 --> 15:57.697
Sykes?

15:57.731 --> 16:00.667
Sykes.
What are you doing here?

16:00.701 --> 16:04.738
I asked for her help catching up
with your investigation,

16:04.773 --> 16:06.573
seeing as she was available

16:06.608 --> 16:07.842
and you were quite rightly
focused on finding our shooter.

16:07.876 --> 16:10.077
How'd you do?

16:10.112 --> 16:12.446
Unfortunately, we still don't
know who we're looking for.

16:12.481 --> 16:14.081
But we did identify
all of the...

16:14.116 --> 16:15.983
well, I guess now
they're victims,

16:16.018 --> 16:18.987
and we collected some useful
stuff from their apartment.

16:19.021 --> 16:20.989
So, let's see.

16:21.024 --> 16:22.591
The, uh...

16:22.625 --> 16:24.726
The guy who gave himself up

16:24.760 --> 16:26.994
and also got shot
in the back of the head

16:27.029 --> 16:31.566
is Lance corporal
Larry Martin from scottsdale.

16:31.600 --> 16:32.733
Ex-marine.

16:32.768 --> 16:35.502
We have former army private

16:35.537 --> 16:39.741
Barry Seaton from decatur,
Illinois, driver of the vehicle,

16:39.775 --> 16:42.010
who detective Sykes followed.

16:42.044 --> 16:44.012
And army private Scott Henry
from San angelo, Texas.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.213
Retired.

16:45.248 --> 16:47.081
Permanently.
Detective Miller...

16:47.116 --> 16:49.050
These men seem to have
become expert

16:49.085 --> 16:52.020
at both choosing their targets
and evading capture.

16:52.054 --> 16:54.890
That's right. They always pick
cash-heavy stores.

16:54.924 --> 16:56.525
We tried predicting
where they would go,

16:56.559 --> 16:57.892
but whenever we were
sitting on them,

16:57.927 --> 16:59.961
they were somewhere else.

16:59.995 --> 17:02.798
Well, can you explain why two of
these men made a clean getaway,

17:02.832 --> 17:06.167
then circled back to shoot one of
their own in the back of the head?

17:06.203 --> 17:07.803
Well, according to
lieutenant Flynn,

17:07.838 --> 17:09.472
corporal Martin
was about to talk.

17:09.506 --> 17:11.840
Maybe his surviving partners
thought he was a weak link.

17:11.876 --> 17:14.678
So all of our men were veterans
in their mid to late 20s.

17:14.712 --> 17:16.747
They have anything else
in common?

17:18.215 --> 17:20.251
Don't know yet, ma'am.

17:20.285 --> 17:24.021
And have we eliminated
some potential connections?

17:27.826 --> 17:29.793
Come on, guys.

17:29.828 --> 17:33.564
We're after some extremely
violent, well-armed offenders.

17:33.598 --> 17:36.199
The city needs us
to pull it together.

17:36.234 --> 17:40.003
And you waited for a moment
like this to put her here.

17:40.038 --> 17:41.905
So you could say those words.

17:41.939 --> 17:44.975
All that "let's pull together
for the good of the city" crap.

17:45.009 --> 17:49.646
Well, we <i>will</i> pull together
because it's our duty.

17:49.681 --> 17:53.584
But later, you and I,
<i>assistant chief,</i>

17:53.618 --> 17:55.286
are going to talk.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.687
Taylor: Okay.

17:56.721 --> 17:57.955
But later.

17:59.057 --> 18:02.126
Before... "Later,"

18:02.160 --> 18:03.761
I'd just like to say,

18:03.795 --> 18:07.832
the I.A.P.D. Needs to be
extra careful right now...

18:07.866 --> 18:09.533
Not only to obey the rules,

18:09.568 --> 18:11.635
but to be seen
obeying the rules.

18:11.670 --> 18:14.638
Therefore,
as the commanding officer

18:14.672 --> 18:18.942
responsible for the conduct
of this investigation,

18:18.977 --> 18:21.245
and before I call to ask

18:21.279 --> 18:23.982
for a prosecutor
to be assigned to this case,

18:24.016 --> 18:26.752
I would like to know
what we are up against...

18:26.786 --> 18:27.986
Now.

18:35.029 --> 18:36.830
You would think
that all these guys

18:36.864 --> 18:38.965
would be from the same branch
of the service,

18:39.000 --> 18:40.033
but they're not.

18:40.067 --> 18:41.701
Or that they served together

18:41.736 --> 18:44.137
at the same time in the same
place... they didn't.

18:44.171 --> 18:46.840
They're not related,
they're not from the same towns.

18:46.874 --> 18:47.974
What else?

18:48.009 --> 18:49.676
They're not listed as members

18:49.710 --> 18:52.012
of any veterans organizations,
no criminal records.

18:52.046 --> 18:54.280
Sanchez: No land lines in their
apartments, no cellphones.

18:54.314 --> 18:55.882
They have Internet connections

18:55.916 --> 18:57.884
and game consoles
but no computers,

18:57.919 --> 18:59.352
so we don't know how they
communicated with each other, ma'am.

18:59.387 --> 19:02.289
But the military angle
has got to have something

19:02.323 --> 19:03.289
to do with it.

19:03.324 --> 19:04.624
Hey, I'm a veteran.

19:04.658 --> 19:06.259
Sorry to interrupt,

19:06.293 --> 19:08.227
but I served
in Afghanistan in '03,

19:08.262 --> 19:10.697
and one place veterans meet up
with each other...

19:10.731 --> 19:12.131
firing ranges.

19:12.166 --> 19:14.033
Right? 'Cause shooting well
is not like riding a bike.

19:14.068 --> 19:15.902
Miller: She's right.

19:15.936 --> 19:18.303
Whoever took out Larry Martin
in the back of that patrol car

19:18.338 --> 19:20.072
was either really lucky
or really good.

19:20.106 --> 19:22.174
And "really good"
takes practice.

19:22.208 --> 19:24.876
Yeah. Hey, uh,
anybody here play fps games?

19:24.911 --> 19:28.714
F-p-what? Fps... first-person-shooter
...online games.

19:28.749 --> 19:30.650
You ever played
one of those, lieutenant?

19:30.684 --> 19:31.985
Uh, you haven't, sir.

19:32.019 --> 19:33.253
He hasn't.

19:33.287 --> 19:34.954
All right, well,
fpses have chat options,

19:34.988 --> 19:37.257
which means while you play,
you can talk to your friends.

19:37.291 --> 19:40.794
I bet you that's how these guys
communicated with each other.

19:40.828 --> 19:44.064
See, there's no computers,
but they all have keyboards.

19:44.098 --> 19:45.332
And they all had
"win or die."

19:46.834 --> 19:49.068
Provenza: Major crimes.

19:49.103 --> 19:51.237
Hey.
I found something.

19:51.272 --> 19:53.741
Captain.

19:53.775 --> 19:54.908
It's tao.

19:54.943 --> 19:58.079
Thank you.

19:58.113 --> 19:59.313
Lieutenant tao,
it's captain Raydor.

19:59.347 --> 20:00.815
Okay.

20:01.850 --> 20:05.219
I'm standing where the killer
shot our suspect.

20:07.221 --> 20:10.957
And I think I found the bullet
I was missing, too.

20:24.177 --> 20:25.778
It's later.

20:27.914 --> 20:29.648
Okay.

20:29.682 --> 20:31.217
Good.

20:31.251 --> 20:32.652
I'll keep this short.

20:32.686 --> 20:34.220
Let's put aside
the insulting way

20:34.254 --> 20:36.556
that you replaced me
in the middle of...

20:36.590 --> 20:37.957
no one replaced you.

20:37.991 --> 20:40.025
You're in the same position
you've always been.

20:40.060 --> 20:42.261
Am I in command
of major crimes?

20:42.296 --> 20:45.097
No. I was replaced... after one week.

20:45.132 --> 20:46.966
Oh, that's not what happened.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.534
That is exactly what happened!

20:48.569 --> 20:50.002
And I want a transfer.

20:50.037 --> 20:52.238
Try letting Raydor run
major crimes without me...

20:52.272 --> 20:53.840
see how well <i>that</i> turns out.
Okay.

20:53.874 --> 20:55.174
I know more about homicides...
Okay.

20:55.208 --> 20:57.543
...than she has time
to learn!

20:57.577 --> 20:58.877
I thought you were going
to keep this short.

21:00.980 --> 21:05.050
We're changing the focus
of major crimes.

21:05.084 --> 21:08.786
We can't just hand the D.A.
Good confessions any more.

21:08.821 --> 21:11.689
We have to try harder...
To avoid trial.

21:11.723 --> 21:14.526
You're talking
about plea bargains.

21:14.560 --> 21:17.929
We don't have the legal
authority to make deals.

21:20.166 --> 21:21.566
Prosecutors do.

21:21.601 --> 21:22.734
Prosecutors.

21:22.769 --> 21:24.836
So that's why
you've been pushing

21:24.870 --> 21:27.072
deputy D.A.S at us
all the time.

21:27.106 --> 21:29.274
You're trying to short-change
the justice system.

21:29.309 --> 21:31.710
Avoiding death-penalty cases

21:31.744 --> 21:34.812
saves the city
millions of dollars.

21:34.847 --> 21:36.714
The I.A.P.D.

21:36.749 --> 21:40.885
Does not negotiate
with murderers.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.153
We'll see.

21:42.187 --> 21:43.688
You'll see.

21:43.722 --> 21:45.790
I want my transfer.

21:47.926 --> 21:50.227
Chief pope handed me
this paperwork himself

21:50.261 --> 21:52.596
just so you know
whose game you're in.

21:53.865 --> 21:56.867
You stay in major crimes,
or you retire.

21:56.901 --> 21:59.870
Now, you want to give me
your badge...

21:59.905 --> 22:02.673
Or do you want to tell me
how one of the fugitives

22:02.707 --> 22:05.042
who escaped from the crime scene
this morning

22:05.076 --> 22:07.078
ended up with a bullet
in his head?

22:07.112 --> 22:11.649
Dr. morales: Well, normally,
I'd say suicide.

22:11.684 --> 22:13.651
Unless...
Unless?

22:13.685 --> 22:16.220
That handgun
was a .40-caliber semi?

22:16.255 --> 22:17.321
Right.

22:17.356 --> 22:18.990
You have it with you?

22:19.024 --> 22:22.027
Patrol wrapped it up
before I had a chance to...

22:22.061 --> 22:23.362
Inspect it properly.

22:23.396 --> 22:25.630
When a person
shoots this kind of gun,

22:25.665 --> 22:26.965
their grip keeps it steady,

22:27.000 --> 22:29.301
allowing the next round
to automatically reload.

22:29.335 --> 22:31.002
But in a suicide,

22:31.037 --> 22:32.805
we often encounter something
called "limp wrist syndrome."

22:32.839 --> 22:34.140
Limp wrist syndrome.

22:34.174 --> 22:36.075
I <i>know.</i>
<i>But it's not what you think.</i>

22:36.109 --> 22:38.244
Huh. After you shoot
yourself here,

22:38.279 --> 22:40.814
the hand holding the gun
can no longer provide

22:40.848 --> 22:42.349
the proper kind of support.

22:42.383 --> 22:46.253
If the weapon malfunctioned
and the automatic reload failed,

22:46.288 --> 22:47.755
this is a suicide.

22:47.789 --> 22:50.091
But if there's a bullet
in the chamber...

22:51.426 --> 22:52.727
There is.

22:52.761 --> 22:54.095
...that could be murder.

22:54.129 --> 22:55.296
Fritz: Excuse me.

22:55.330 --> 22:56.830
I can identify your victim.

22:56.865 --> 22:59.299
Great.

22:59.334 --> 23:00.767
Fritz:
Private Randall John.

23:00.802 --> 23:02.936
Ex-U.S. marine
from Clayton, Georgia,

23:02.970 --> 23:04.237
not connected or related

23:04.271 --> 23:06.405
to any of our other
victims/suspects.

23:06.440 --> 23:08.641
But Sykes was right.

23:08.675 --> 23:12.311
FBI found all four of our guys
signed in to gun heaven,

23:12.345 --> 23:14.913
a firing range
up in Northridge.

23:14.948 --> 23:18.317
So, our missing suspect is
probably in their customer base.

23:18.351 --> 23:19.918
Along with about
22,000 other people.

23:19.953 --> 23:22.054
This is the user list
for gun heaven.

23:22.088 --> 23:24.223
Now, it's broken down
alphabetically,

23:24.257 --> 23:26.359
so I can't tell
when people were there

23:26.393 --> 23:28.194
or who they were there with.

23:28.228 --> 23:30.697
These men have to have
other connections

23:30.731 --> 23:32.932
besides firing ranges
and online games.

23:32.967 --> 23:35.168
They became close enough
to form a mob.

23:35.202 --> 23:37.671
That did not happen
at gun heaven.

23:37.705 --> 23:39.940
The FBI's out talking
to their families right now.

23:39.975 --> 23:42.143
We're bound to come up with
other common denominators.

23:42.177 --> 23:43.377
Anything so far?

23:43.412 --> 23:45.079
Not much other
than surprised parents.

23:45.113 --> 23:46.448
Everyone seemed to think

23:46.482 --> 23:48.816
their sons were doing a lot
better than they were.

23:48.851 --> 23:51.987
That's probably because they stopped
asking for money.

23:52.021 --> 23:54.456
Oh. This is, um...

23:54.490 --> 23:55.757
Excuse me.

23:55.791 --> 23:57.959
I'll get back to you tomorrow.

23:57.993 --> 23:59.761
Hey, chief!

23:59.795 --> 24:00.929
Fritz: Hi, honey.

24:00.963 --> 24:03.064
Lieutenant tao,

24:03.099 --> 24:05.400
do you think we should try and find
out if our marine private here...

24:05.435 --> 24:06.435
Uh, what's his name?

24:06.469 --> 24:07.869
Randall John.

24:07.904 --> 24:09.471
Private John and the young man

24:09.505 --> 24:11.339
that lieutenant Flynn spoke to
in the car

24:11.373 --> 24:12.740
were shot with the same gun?

24:12.774 --> 24:14.041
I'll get on that.

24:14.076 --> 24:15.176
Thank you.

24:15.210 --> 24:18.479
Well, see you later, then.

24:22.383 --> 24:24.151
Yes?

24:24.185 --> 24:27.854
The kid you're describing
as the young man in the car...

24:27.888 --> 24:29.122
call him Larry Martin.

24:29.156 --> 24:30.457
When working homicide,

24:30.491 --> 24:32.892
it's good to know
your victims by name.

24:34.495 --> 24:36.296
And I have to tell you,
captain,

24:36.330 --> 24:39.366
in the custody of any other police
department in this country,

24:39.400 --> 24:42.101
Larry would have been taken
someplace safe

24:42.136 --> 24:44.103
and allowed to confess,

24:44.138 --> 24:45.438
which he was ready to do.

24:45.472 --> 24:47.806
But because of some
bullshit regulation

24:47.841 --> 24:49.842
that you put into place
at F.I.D.,

24:49.876 --> 24:52.311
some stupid policy
that when shots are fired,

24:52.345 --> 24:54.480
suspects must remain
at a crime scene,

24:54.514 --> 24:56.816
Larry Martin got his head
shot off!

24:56.850 --> 24:59.452
And every single problem
that we're having

24:59.486 --> 25:01.121
in this investigation...

25:01.155 --> 25:04.491
especially not knowing who
the hell we're looking for...

25:04.525 --> 25:06.360
every problem we're having
is because of you.

25:12.967 --> 25:14.534
Andy...

25:14.569 --> 25:17.204
You are right about that.

25:17.238 --> 25:20.073
The I.A.P.D. Is the only police
department in this country

25:20.107 --> 25:21.908
that would have held
Larry Martin

25:21.942 --> 25:23.109
on site for questioning.

25:23.144 --> 25:25.845
Yeah?

25:27.114 --> 25:28.381
Yeah.

25:28.416 --> 25:30.083
So, how did the killer know

25:30.118 --> 25:31.819
that he could circle back around
30 minutes later

25:31.853 --> 25:33.454
and Larry Martin
would still be there?

25:33.489 --> 25:35.356
That's a very good question.

25:39.595 --> 25:40.928
When you think about it,

25:40.963 --> 25:42.397
these young men seem to know

25:42.431 --> 25:44.566
quite a lot about
the I.A.P.D.'S investigation.

25:44.600 --> 25:46.000
Didn't detective Miller say

25:46.035 --> 25:48.003
that he tried to predict
their targets,

25:48.037 --> 25:50.838
but every store he was sitting
on, they were somewhere else?

25:50.873 --> 25:52.840
And he said
every male member of his family

25:52.875 --> 25:53.941
had been in the military.

25:53.976 --> 25:55.142
Including h <i>son.</i>

25:55.177 --> 25:56.511
Who, I bet, lives at home.

25:58.413 --> 26:00.515
Miller: Greg?

26:00.549 --> 26:02.483
I have a guest.

26:02.517 --> 26:03.584
You're home late.

26:03.618 --> 26:06.554
Yeah. Well, a long day.

26:06.588 --> 26:09.256
We have company.

26:09.291 --> 26:11.559
Julio, this is my son, Greg.

26:11.593 --> 26:12.860
Hey.

26:12.895 --> 26:14.128
Hey.

26:17.900 --> 26:19.234
What's going on?

26:23.172 --> 26:25.340
Big shootout today.

26:25.375 --> 26:28.377
You know those robberies
I've been working?

26:28.411 --> 26:30.279
The guys knocking over
grocery stores?

26:30.313 --> 26:33.114
Yeah. Four of them
were killed today.

26:33.149 --> 26:34.883
Huh.

26:34.917 --> 26:36.952
Still looking for the fifth.

26:36.986 --> 26:40.255
From home?

26:42.592 --> 26:44.559
When we do this stuff
at our desks,

26:44.593 --> 26:46.328
the city <i>has</i> to
pay us overtime.

26:46.362 --> 26:47.929
Right.

26:47.963 --> 26:49.998
Forgot.

26:50.032 --> 26:51.500
You guys work for free now.

26:51.534 --> 26:52.567
Can I help any?

26:52.602 --> 26:53.968
Yeah.

26:54.003 --> 26:55.604
More boxes in the trunk.

27:07.650 --> 27:09.550
Officer: Greg Miller?

27:09.585 --> 27:11.486
Hey, what's going on?
Get on your knees.

27:11.520 --> 27:13.054
Hands behind your back.
What are you doing?

27:13.088 --> 27:13.921
You agreed.

27:13.956 --> 27:15.189
We'll get Greg a lawyer,

27:15.223 --> 27:16.224
and you stand down.

27:16.258 --> 27:17.625
Stand down!

27:17.659 --> 27:19.527
Dad! Dad? You have the
right to remain...

27:19.561 --> 27:22.129
okay, guys. You can start
the house search over there.

27:22.164 --> 27:24.265
In the backyard...
throw up some work lights.

27:28.270 --> 27:30.404
You get that gun off my son?

27:30.439 --> 27:33.641
Yes. I did.

27:33.676 --> 27:35.509
Sir.

27:35.544 --> 27:37.211
Oh, yeah.

27:44.120 --> 27:45.620
Greg has...

27:45.655 --> 27:48.323
he was never like this before.

27:48.357 --> 27:52.127
It has to be
post-traumatic stress.

27:52.161 --> 27:53.995
Something.

27:54.030 --> 27:55.397
<i>Has</i> to be.

27:55.431 --> 27:58.500
Yeah, well...

27:58.534 --> 28:03.138
Just make sure you tell
his attorney that.

28:24.508 --> 28:27.466
Let me try and explain
from my view as a D.A.

28:27.591 --> 28:29.325
It's great that you're able

28:29.359 --> 28:31.627
to match the gun
to the crime scene.

28:31.662 --> 28:34.030
But you have not
put the suspect there.

28:34.064 --> 28:36.833
And outside of a list
of over 20,000 customers

28:36.867 --> 28:39.035
of a very successful
firing range,

28:39.069 --> 28:41.504
you haven't even linked
the suspect

28:41.539 --> 28:42.672
to any other member
of this gang.

28:42.707 --> 28:45.375
What about the $200,000

28:45.409 --> 28:47.010
we found
at Greg Miller's house?

28:47.044 --> 28:48.878
It's not traceable
to any of the robberies.

28:48.912 --> 28:50.746
Now, don't misunderstand me.

28:50.781 --> 28:53.549
This is an excellent
circumstantial case,

28:53.584 --> 28:55.318
which I will win in court.

28:55.352 --> 28:56.786
But it doesn't help me

28:56.820 --> 28:58.521
with this new
deal-making paradigm

28:58.555 --> 28:59.956
that you want to put in place.

28:59.990 --> 29:02.358
Taylor: Sorry.
D.D.A. Michaels,

29:02.392 --> 29:04.393
we cannot wait
for the stars to align.

29:04.428 --> 29:05.928
We know who did it.

29:05.962 --> 29:08.063
<i>Know</i> how it was done.

29:08.098 --> 29:10.465
If we can't reach a settlement
under these circumstances...

29:10.500 --> 29:12.468
Chief Taylor's right.

29:12.502 --> 29:13.569
There will be challenges
to every case.

29:13.603 --> 29:15.771
What I would like you to do

29:15.805 --> 29:18.107
is tell them what we would like
the suspect to admit

29:18.141 --> 29:19.474
in his statement of facts,

29:19.509 --> 29:20.942
and let me...

29:22.044 --> 29:24.112
...think.

29:24.147 --> 29:25.814
For a moment.

29:25.849 --> 29:28.084
Rusty:
Geez, what are you doing?!

29:28.118 --> 29:29.919
Listen. No.
I am getting a lawyer,

29:29.953 --> 29:32.655
and I am suing you for
holding me against my will.

29:32.689 --> 29:34.457
If you don't knock it off,
and I mean right now,

29:34.491 --> 29:36.459
the next place you go is
gonna have locks on the doors

29:36.494 --> 29:37.961
and bars on the windows.

29:37.996 --> 29:40.765
Do you want to spend
the next two years

29:40.799 --> 29:43.668
in a juvenile detention center?

29:43.702 --> 29:46.136
Keep talking!

29:46.171 --> 29:47.404
And see what happens.

29:49.674 --> 29:53.978
Officially, rusty is in
an emergency-care situation,

29:54.012 --> 29:57.881
which means he needs
24/7 adult supervision.

29:57.915 --> 30:00.750
Okay. But by whom?

30:00.784 --> 30:04.086
Well, I am working that out,
but in the meantime,

30:04.121 --> 30:06.856
have him walked across
the street to the doctor,

30:06.890 --> 30:09.125
have his personal things
sent to my office,

30:09.159 --> 30:11.994
and he'll be out of your hair
for the rest of the day.

30:17.201 --> 30:21.504
Before we can deal
with any of your concerns,

30:21.538 --> 30:25.575
we need to comply fully
with the law.

30:25.609 --> 30:28.177
And we will.

30:34.784 --> 30:37.653
God, does she love the rules.

30:37.687 --> 30:38.754
You have no idea.

30:39.889 --> 30:41.457
Come on.

30:48.531 --> 30:51.567
Greg isn't guilty of anything
except...

30:51.601 --> 30:53.836
Misjudging the character
of a friend...

30:53.871 --> 30:56.706
not that uncommon with people
suffering from PTSD.

30:56.741 --> 30:58.942
Mr. banks thinks we're in the
middle of a big misunderstanding.

30:58.976 --> 31:00.778
Tao:
Greg is mentally impaired,

31:00.812 --> 31:02.446
though not under
a doctor's care.

31:02.481 --> 31:03.914
Flynn: He also doesn't know
any of our victims.

31:03.949 --> 31:05.783
He was holding the gun

31:05.817 --> 31:07.751
and all the money we found
for a friend...

31:07.786 --> 31:09.687
He'd rather not identify.

31:09.721 --> 31:10.854
Sharon: I see.

31:10.889 --> 31:12.456
Is it possible that that friend

31:12.490 --> 31:14.525
was someone that you met
in rehab?

31:14.559 --> 31:18.162
Your father... who wishes
he was dead, by the way...

31:18.196 --> 31:21.498
told me that he thought
you were doing better,

31:21.532 --> 31:23.601
which made me wonder,
"better than what?"

31:23.635 --> 31:27.004
Does that mean better than when
you came back from Afghanistan

31:27.038 --> 31:28.605
addicted to meth?

31:28.640 --> 31:30.607
Fritz: At lieutenant Provenza's
suggestion,

31:30.642 --> 31:32.509
the FBI followed up
with the families

31:32.544 --> 31:34.545
of all these other young men
you claim not to know.

31:34.579 --> 31:35.779
And last November,

31:35.814 --> 31:38.015
every one of them
was parked with you

31:38.049 --> 31:40.551
in a 30-bed drug-treatment
center in studio city

31:40.585 --> 31:41.919
specializing in veterans.

31:41.953 --> 31:46.589
Placing my client
at a rehab is not the same

31:46.624 --> 31:47.891
as putting him
at a crime scene.

31:47.925 --> 31:51.194
Okay. But... Suppose

31:51.229 --> 31:53.697
while he was coming off
of drugs,

31:53.731 --> 31:57.234
your client became close
to a group of at-risk veterans,

31:57.268 --> 31:59.970
and suppose
that he talked them into

32:00.005 --> 32:02.272
pulling a series
of armed robberies,

32:02.307 --> 32:05.542
taking full advantage
of everything he could learn

32:05.577 --> 32:07.811
as the son of
an I.A.P.D. Detective.

32:07.846 --> 32:11.015
And suppose that,
after much success,

32:11.049 --> 32:14.151
Greg discovered that one
of his little gang

32:14.185 --> 32:16.086
was being followed
by undercover police officers

32:16.121 --> 32:18.022
and knew it was time
to call it quits.

32:18.056 --> 32:20.724
That would explain why he broke
from his M.O. Yesterday,

32:20.759 --> 32:23.127
why he split them up,

32:23.161 --> 32:25.997
why he sent them into a store
with a silent alarm.

32:26.031 --> 32:27.632
He was trying
to get them killed.

32:27.666 --> 32:29.801
And when that proved
only partially successful,

32:29.835 --> 32:32.036
he came back around
to the crime scene

32:32.070 --> 32:33.804
and shot Larry Martin in the back of the head.
No. No, no, no. That was not me!

32:33.839 --> 32:36.273
Banks: Shut up! Then he
shot Randall John, too.

32:36.308 --> 32:38.842
And <i>th</i> is premeditated homicide.

32:38.877 --> 32:41.812
This conference
is officially over.

32:41.847 --> 32:43.848
And no more questions to Greg.

32:43.882 --> 32:45.082
But we could settle this...

32:45.117 --> 32:46.918
Oh, no, no, no.
I am not settling.

32:46.952 --> 32:48.653
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Do you want me
to quote the supreme court case

32:48.687 --> 32:50.722
demanding you bring a deal
to your client?

32:50.756 --> 32:52.157
You want to walk out that door

32:52.191 --> 32:54.126
and right into an ethics
inquiry? Be my guest.

32:59.900 --> 33:02.568
Fine.
What's the offer?

33:05.005 --> 33:07.273
All right. I have here
a statement of facts

33:07.308 --> 33:09.209
in which you admit
to participating

33:09.243 --> 33:10.810
in these armed robberies,

33:10.845 --> 33:12.579
which would also mean
you're pleading guilty

33:12.613 --> 33:14.081
to two counts of felony murder,

33:14.115 --> 33:15.949
for your friends who were shot
to death by the police.

33:15.984 --> 33:20.021
Now, in return, the state will
not pursue charges against you

33:20.055 --> 33:24.224
for the premeditated homicide
of both Randall John

33:24.259 --> 33:25.292
and Larry Martin.

33:33.868 --> 33:35.836
If Greg can convince you
that he's not guilty

33:35.870 --> 33:37.271
of the first-degree murder,

33:37.305 --> 33:40.340
you really should reduce
these charges to manslaughter.

33:40.375 --> 33:45.079
My client served this country
in wartime.

33:48.816 --> 33:50.384
Let's hear what he has to say.

33:53.222 --> 33:54.823
If we can't agree
on sentencing,

33:54.857 --> 33:57.125
nothing you say can be used
against you in court,

33:57.160 --> 33:59.829
which means, legally,
my client is just presenting you

33:59.863 --> 34:02.231
with a hypothetical version
of events.

34:04.968 --> 34:06.335
It's all right.

34:11.809 --> 34:14.077
No one was trying
to kill Larry yesterday.

34:14.110 --> 34:15.777
That was an accident.

34:15.813 --> 34:18.114
We were trying to create a
diversion so he could get away.

34:18.148 --> 34:19.282
You were aiming at the vehicle.

34:19.315 --> 34:20.984
No.

34:21.018 --> 34:22.985
We were aimi <i>away</i>
<i>from the police.</i>

34:23.020 --> 34:24.786
We had no idea Larry
was in the back of that car.

34:24.822 --> 34:26.822
And when we saw what happened,

34:26.857 --> 34:29.324
when Randall realized
he'd shot Larry...

34:29.360 --> 34:31.360
He looked at me...

34:31.396 --> 34:33.965
And before I could stop him,

34:33.998 --> 34:35.900
he blew his brains out.

34:35.934 --> 34:39.937
Banks: Look,
we had a group of boys

34:39.971 --> 34:42.806
who were having a problem
readjusting to civilian life.

34:42.842 --> 34:43.975
Is that a tragedy?
Yes.

34:44.009 --> 34:46.745
Is it premeditated murder?
Hardly.

34:46.779 --> 34:49.748
Without intent,
it's manslaughter.

34:52.886 --> 34:54.253
The <i>was</i> intent, sir.

34:56.156 --> 34:58.724
And you can prove that how?

34:58.759 --> 35:02.227
When you fire a Smith & Wesson
.40 caliber...

35:02.262 --> 35:04.129
Handgun...

35:04.164 --> 35:07.266
The kickback lifts your hands
up in the air,

35:07.301 --> 35:09.368
like this... bang!

35:09.403 --> 35:10.703
Bang!

35:10.738 --> 35:12.338
Bang!

35:12.373 --> 35:14.874
Which means you have to readjust
the gun after every shot

35:14.908 --> 35:17.143
in order to keep striking
the same target.

35:17.177 --> 35:18.744
Isn't that right, soldier?

35:20.781 --> 35:24.150
You hit the patrol car
every time you fired at it.

35:24.184 --> 35:25.384
<i>You</i> were aiming.

35:25.419 --> 35:28.120
And aiming equals intent.

35:32.091 --> 35:34.827
That would not be...

35:34.861 --> 35:36.628
Conclusive.

35:36.663 --> 35:39.564
Maybe not, but I've taken
less than this to murder one,

35:39.599 --> 35:41.800
which is where this is headed.

35:41.834 --> 35:46.537
<i>Or</i> your client
agrees to do two counts

35:46.572 --> 35:47.705
of second-degree murder,
30 to life,

35:47.740 --> 35:49.241
concurrent...
that's a generous offer,

35:49.275 --> 35:51.176
and it's on the table
for the next five minutes

35:51.211 --> 35:53.579
and the next five minutes only.

36:02.890 --> 36:04.090
No!

36:06.293 --> 36:09.262
Let me give you
some perspective, Greg,

36:09.296 --> 36:12.599
because none of us is happy
with this situation,

36:12.633 --> 36:13.933
but you are the only one
with options here,

36:13.968 --> 36:15.268
and they're very easy...

36:15.302 --> 36:16.937
To understand.

36:16.971 --> 36:20.207
Sign this statement of facts,

36:20.241 --> 36:22.609
agree to say these words
out loud in front of a judge,

36:22.643 --> 36:25.278
and you have chosen life.

36:25.313 --> 36:29.215
Refuse, and you have accepted
a process

36:29.250 --> 36:33.086
that will only end
with your execution

36:33.120 --> 36:34.321
by lethal injection.

36:34.355 --> 36:36.123
I want to be perfectly clear
with you,

36:36.157 --> 36:39.626
Greg, if you choose death,

36:39.660 --> 36:42.696
we have an obligation
to see that you get it.

36:42.730 --> 36:44.231
Are you ready for that?

36:45.666 --> 36:48.168
What's it gonna be, Greg?

36:48.202 --> 36:50.370
Deal...

36:50.404 --> 36:51.905
Or no deal?

37:15.798 --> 37:17.332
Sykes.

37:19.401 --> 37:21.368
What are you doing here?

37:21.403 --> 37:25.171
Captain Raydor requested
my transfer to major crimes.

37:25.206 --> 37:26.773
Looks like I'll be sitting here
next to you.

37:29.743 --> 37:31.210
What was it you said?

37:31.245 --> 37:32.945
Oh, yeah.

37:32.980 --> 37:37.717
"Oh, that captain Raydor
and her crazy ideas."

37:37.751 --> 37:39.853
You are the biggest
two-faced ass-kisser

37:39.887 --> 37:42.021
I have ever met.

37:42.056 --> 37:43.523
It's gotten me this far.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.401
Thank you, detective Miller.

37:54.435 --> 37:56.003
And for your sake,

37:56.037 --> 37:58.172
I am glad Greg's deal
was no worse than it was.

37:58.206 --> 37:59.406
He didn't deserve that deal!

37:59.441 --> 38:02.443
Yes. Thank you.

38:02.477 --> 38:04.312
Bye.

38:04.346 --> 38:06.947
Greg Miller is going to jail
for the people <i>we</i> killed...

38:06.982 --> 38:08.449
And getting off scot-free

38:08.483 --> 38:10.985
for the murders
he committed himself.

38:12.254 --> 38:14.188
But I guess that's all right

38:14.223 --> 38:16.958
because you saved the city
a <i>lot</i> of money.

38:16.992 --> 38:19.927
I bet you're really happy
about that, huh?

38:19.962 --> 38:25.533
I put a murderer away for life
in less than 48 hours,

38:25.567 --> 38:28.537
which is not the usual routine
around here. So, yes...

38:28.571 --> 38:32.040
I feel excellent.
Thank you for asking.

38:32.075 --> 38:34.977
So, we've been doing it
all wrong, is that it?

38:35.011 --> 38:37.479
When suspects agree to a deal,

38:37.514 --> 38:39.782
like Greg Miller just did,

38:39.816 --> 38:42.886
they surrender all rights
to appeal.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.354
We've locked them up,
we've thrown away the key,

38:44.388 --> 38:45.455
we move on.

38:45.489 --> 38:47.391
With people like Amy Sykes?

38:47.425 --> 38:49.293
Ye gods!

38:49.327 --> 38:52.829
As difficult as this may be
for you to understand,

38:52.864 --> 38:56.967
I need at least one person
working here

38:57.001 --> 38:59.402
who actually likes me.

38:59.437 --> 39:02.005
Sykes doesn't like you.

39:02.039 --> 39:04.541
She's just pretending
to like you to get the job.

39:06.277 --> 39:07.544
Still...

39:07.579 --> 39:09.847
Oh. Am I, uh,
interrupting something?

39:09.882 --> 39:10.915
No, no, no, no.

39:10.949 --> 39:11.883
We are finished.

39:13.185 --> 39:16.021
Aren't we finished...

39:16.055 --> 39:16.988
Lieutenant?

39:17.023 --> 39:19.424
Yeah.

39:19.459 --> 39:21.160
I guess we'll see.

39:30.638 --> 39:31.504
Oh.

39:35.642 --> 39:38.311
I don't even know
why she wants this stuff.

39:44.318 --> 39:45.952
Good job today.

39:45.986 --> 39:47.220
You too.

39:47.254 --> 39:49.622
Oh.

39:49.657 --> 39:51.145
Brenda's been asking
if you put any more thought

39:51.146 --> 39:54.193
into what to do about rusty.

40:02.469 --> 40:05.305
Don't think I'm gonna be
all, like, thankful

40:05.339 --> 40:06.873
for... You taking me in.

40:06.907 --> 40:08.141
Sharon: Oh, trust me.

40:08.175 --> 40:10.076
You're not the first adolescent

40:10.110 --> 40:12.211
to grace my home
with your presence.

40:12.246 --> 40:14.447
Having raised two teenagers
of my own,

40:14.481 --> 40:17.516
I have tremendous capacity
for ingratitude.

40:17.551 --> 40:21.321
Rusty... It's so funny.

40:21.355 --> 40:24.256
Just when you get good
at being a mother,

40:24.291 --> 40:26.025
you're fired.

40:26.059 --> 40:27.226
Or you quit.

40:34.067 --> 40:38.204
So, what are we supposed to call
each other, anyway?

40:38.238 --> 40:39.372
Oh.

40:39.406 --> 40:43.176
I think...

40:44.678 --> 40:46.545
...you should call me...

40:46.580 --> 40:48.114
Captain Raydor.

40:48.148 --> 40:51.618
Okay.
And you can call me Mr. Beck.

40:51.652 --> 40:54.487
<i>You</i> are the child
in this relationship.

40:54.522 --> 40:56.222
No, I am the witness.

40:56.257 --> 40:59.559
If you are the police officer,
then I am the witness.

40:59.594 --> 41:02.462
There are not a lot of people around
here who call me by my first name.

41:02.497 --> 41:05.966
Oh, well, maybe that's why you
live alone with a spare bedroom.

41:06.001 --> 41:10.605
I live alone
because my children are grown.

41:10.639 --> 41:13.174
Spare bedroom is
for when they visit.

41:13.208 --> 41:16.277
But you may call me Sharon.

41:17.513 --> 41:18.613
How's that?

41:18.648 --> 41:20.615
"Sharon"?

41:20.650 --> 41:21.950
Mm-hmm.

41:21.985 --> 41:24.253
What, is that
like your bad idea

41:24.287 --> 41:25.554
of a joke or something?

41:25.589 --> 41:27.156
Why do you say that?

41:27.190 --> 41:30.359
Sharon is my mother's name.

41:33.530 --> 41:34.988
Oh.

41:34.997 --> 41:39.235
God, you haven't been looking
for her at all, have you?

41:39.269 --> 41:43.272
Rusty, I just got
this job yesterday.

41:43.306 --> 41:46.408
Give me a chance to catch up.

41:46.443 --> 41:47.476
I am making
a good-faith effort.

41:47.510 --> 41:49.979
I am.
Where's your bathroom?

41:50.013 --> 41:51.347
It's right down there.

41:57.287 --> 41:58.788
Rusty.

42:01.225 --> 42:03.259
If it is possible
to find your mother,

42:03.293 --> 42:04.560
I will do it.

42:04.595 --> 42:06.662
I promise you.

42:06.697 --> 42:08.798
Sure you will, captain.

42:10.467 --> 42:13.035
Sure you will.
