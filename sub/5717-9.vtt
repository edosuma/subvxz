00:06.488 --> 00:07.605
Gimme a kiss.

00:07.785 --> 00:09.621
I said no !
OH !

00:10.605 --> 00:12.175
No one says no to me !

00:12.297 --> 00:13.859
I think you should slow down.

00:14.297 --> 00:15.562
This isn't like you.

00:15.588 --> 00:17.422
There's obviously something
you're not telling me.

00:17.516 --> 00:20.273
Who will take your
word, against mine?

00:20.307 --> 00:22.986
They'll call you a tramp.

00:23.001 --> 00:24.982
It will ruin your
brother's career.

00:25.079 --> 00:27.141
I'm going to keep
Stardust here, so that I

00:27.167 --> 00:29.106
don't have to keep going
back to Ash Park.

00:29.161 --> 00:31.051
It's a horse for a mansion,
not a farmer's horse.

00:31.107 --> 00:32.363
Well, you didn't marry a farmer.

00:32.387 --> 00:34.583
You married me, and
I'm doing my best.

00:34.622 --> 00:35.779
They're all dead.

00:36.470 --> 00:37.626
Every single one.

00:37.650 --> 00:39.743
There must be something,
that we can do.

00:39.822 --> 00:40.970
We planted too late.

00:41.125 --> 00:44.140
If there is to be no wine,
I want my money back.

00:44.191 --> 00:47.214
I just wanted to thank you, for
coming to Reggie's funeral.

00:47.254 --> 00:50.042
It meant a lot to the men.
And to me.

00:50.066 --> 00:52.160
It was a stupid mistake.

00:52.184 --> 00:53.675
And it will never happen again.

00:53.699 --> 00:55.300
How can either of us continue?

00:55.582 --> 00:57.441
We both want more, than the other can give.

00:57.590 --> 00:59.242
I'm going to have the operation.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.900
The risks are too great.

01:01.236 --> 01:02.876
Rene, Mon amour.

01:05.923 --> 01:08.774
I lost him once before,
and I grieved for him.

01:08.810 --> 01:10.739
I don't know how to
do it, a second time.

01:10.743 --> 01:13.899
You have the chance to change the
lives of everyone in Inverness.

01:13.954 --> 01:15.376
You need someone to
arrange your schedule.

01:15.392 --> 01:16.462
I'll get an assistant.

01:16.493 --> 01:17.446
Or a wife.

01:17.462 --> 01:19.872
This may not be the
future you want,

01:19.880 --> 01:21.536
but I would like to propose,

01:21.544 --> 01:22.429
A marriage...

01:22.536 --> 01:23.700
.. of sorts.

01:23.982 --> 01:25.114
Congratulations.

01:25.646 --> 01:27.653
I now pronounce
you man and wife.

01:33.923 --> 01:35.351
May I kiss the bride?

01:36.708 --> 01:41.074
Or should I say: The wife of the
future Prime Minister of our country.

01:41.369 --> 01:43.203
Thank you for coming.
Indeed.

01:43.282 --> 01:45.781
Free drink and   , why wouldn't I be here?

01:45.805 --> 01:48.672
Family please, thank you,
and here, thank you.

01:48.704 --> 01:52.586
And here, thank you.
And if you please, Mrs. Bligh Sr.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.786
Next to the bride, thank you.

01:57.011 --> 01:58.167
Thank you.

02:04.563 --> 02:06.426
I appreciate your
being here, mother.

02:07.067 --> 02:09.621
Well, you're now married
to someone for whom

02:09.630 --> 02:12.559
the cut and thrust of politics
will be the equivalent of a..

02:12.575 --> 02:15.137
an afternoon frolic
on Bondi Beach.

02:15.317 --> 02:17.059
I believe, we'll
make a good team.

02:18.380 --> 02:21.524
In a marriage of convenience,
it's easy to say.

02:22.055 --> 02:23.938
Not always easy to live.

02:25.161 --> 02:28.192
I hope you're very certain, that she
doesn't expect you to love her.

02:29.247 --> 02:32.328
You do well to think of your wife,
as an obsessive 15-year old girl.

02:33.579 --> 02:34.867
Mr. Bligh, please.

02:36.005 --> 02:40.254
And when slighted, a 15-year
old girl can be very unstable.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.547
Hey, hey, hey, hey !
I'm fine.

02:55.556 --> 02:56.915
Give it here. Which way?

02:57.548 --> 03:00.180
Where do you want it?
Put it on the bed, thanks.

03:00.814 --> 03:04.422
Just looking for Rene's
prayer cloth and yamuka.

03:04.806 --> 03:06.166
He should wear them.

03:07.712 --> 03:10.430
He was always packing things
away, in case we had to run.

03:11.255 --> 03:13.645
I wasn't thinking,
bringing him back here.

03:13.669 --> 03:14.809
Now, why's that, Missy?

03:15.427 --> 03:18.309
The least I can do for his family
and for him, is a proper burial.

03:18.341 --> 03:20.266
Well, tell people what
to do, and I'll help.

03:20.337 --> 03:22.258
A Jewish man should be
sitting with him now

03:22.284 --> 03:25.243
and into the night,
until the rabbi comes.

03:25.907 --> 03:26.407
Right.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.309
I should have stayed
near the synagogue.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.286
I don't even know, if the
rabbi can be here tomorrow.

03:30.319 --> 03:32.674
Well, will I do,
to sit with Rene?

03:33.244 --> 03:36.611
I'm not much fun with
prayers, but he was a mate.

03:38.749 --> 03:39.646
Thank you.

03:41.971 --> 03:44.650
Ah, here we are.

03:51.553 --> 03:52.642
Just put them...

03:55.608 --> 03:56.686
.. near him.

03:59.643 --> 04:01.010
It'll be an honor.

04:55.930 --> 04:57.934
One of the most
exciting days for

04:57.960 --> 04:59.938
the Italian farmers
of Inverness,

04:59.946 --> 05:02.016
is the day, when the
tomatoes are bottled

05:02.042 --> 05:05.317
into a delicious
sauce, called passata.

05:05.434 --> 05:07.699
Long tables are set
out, under the trees

05:07.718 --> 05:09.965
filled with families,
cutting tomatoes,

05:09.971 --> 05:12.363
a dozen conversations
going on at once.

05:12.376 --> 05:14.558
These Italian traditions engaged

05:14.584 --> 05:16.591
her on a level, once unknown.

05:16.631 --> 05:18.601
She could not help
but compare the

05:18.627 --> 05:20.458
warm public display of affection

05:20.469 --> 05:22.397
with the more stayed
and inhibited

05:22.423 --> 05:24.743
relationships, she had
known as a child.

05:24.993 --> 05:27.897
But now, Paolo was threatening,
not to go this year

05:27.923 --> 05:30.235
and none of his excuses rang through.

05:30.298 --> 05:33.540
Sometimes, married to Paolo seemed
like living in the eye of a storm.

05:33.557 --> 05:34.342
Anna !

05:34.368 --> 05:36.722
..then another and never
knowing whether...

05:37.729 --> 05:41.900
Gino, I still have another ten minutes.

05:43.393 --> 05:44.865
Top one is a bill from the vet.

05:45.209 --> 05:46.817
But if he was only
here for a quarter of

05:46.843 --> 05:48.851
an hour, I didn't
think he'd charge.

05:48.920 --> 05:51.115
And you think a veterinary
surgeon works for eggs?

05:51.576 --> 05:53.279
Stardust had a chill.

05:59.263 --> 06:02.809
I can get father to pay.
No, no, no, you’re right. I'll pay it.

06:03.481 --> 06:05.926
Well, now that you're
fixing up the shed.. Yeah !

06:15.879 --> 06:17.276
The telegram has been sent.

06:18.550 --> 06:20.589
It should get to Paris, within 24 hours.

06:22.488 --> 06:23.784
His poor sister.

06:25.261 --> 06:26.355
You need to go home.

06:27.984 --> 06:30.468
I can give you something
to help you sleep.

06:31.929 --> 06:33.796
I'm still waiting for
the rabbi to confirm.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.935
There's a note in the
book, when he telephones.

06:35.940 --> 06:37.825
we'll tell him: Anytime tomorrow.

06:40.685 --> 06:41.349
Come on.

06:42.337 --> 06:43.673
Roy is ready to drive you home.

06:43.758 --> 06:45.008
I've got this thought...

06:45.786 --> 06:47.173
.. running through my mind,

06:50.391 --> 06:52.172
.. that he should
have fought harder.

06:52.887 --> 06:55.996
His body gave up, not him.

07:01.286 --> 07:02.215
Never mind.

07:03.723 --> 07:04.652
Tell me,

07:05.833 --> 07:07.601
It's too late now, anyway.

07:09.926 --> 07:11.887
Everything is just
too damn late.

07:40.411 --> 07:42.941
A trunk call to Sydney,
thank you, Mildred.

07:50.820 --> 07:53.195
Ridiculous.
No.

08:02.337 --> 08:03.117
NO !!

08:14.767 --> 08:17.080
We both know, that
that was Jack.

08:17.590 --> 08:20.254
Actually, it was probably
a potential buyer.

08:20.926 --> 08:22.785
Word got out, that I
might be selling.

08:23.317 --> 08:24.691
Oh, you are not.

08:25.294 --> 08:26.910
Honestly, between
you and George..

08:26.934 --> 08:28.771
Goodnight mother.
Carolyn?

08:29.567 --> 08:32.633
I'd be much obliged, if you'd drive
me to Ash Park in the morning.

08:33.052 --> 08:35.864
Norman's mother is unwell, so..
Do you need to go?

08:36.982 --> 08:38.703
Why else would I ask?

08:39.235 --> 08:41.282
I want to keep an eye
on George's campaign.

08:41.634 --> 08:42.539
Alright.

08:48.411 --> 08:50.254
To the new member for Inverness.

08:50.325 --> 08:51.754
No counting chickens.

08:51.763 --> 08:54.036
I'll call Clyde Preston,
first thing in the morning.

08:54.053 --> 08:57.069
And tell him to take his open cut
mine anywhere but Inverness.

08:57.310 --> 09:00.486
Or, that a coalmine would be a
welcome employment opportunity

09:00.510 --> 09:02.907
and improve our
bridges and roads.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.693
Most people don't want a mine.

09:04.873 --> 09:07.814
Most people didn't want
penicillin, until they had it.

09:08.701 --> 09:10.068
To be discussed.

09:11.178 --> 09:12.987
This is where you drop me off?

09:14.416 --> 09:15.776
Thank you for today.

09:18.970 --> 09:20.157
You sleep well.

09:40.252 --> 09:43.345
Such a pity the
Goldberg's aren't here.

09:43.459 --> 09:45.154
The Jewish bloke from
Brungston turned up

09:45.162 --> 09:47.794
took over from me and he's staying
until the rabbi gets here.

09:47.810 --> 09:49.986
Did the rabbi telephone?
Yes, he did.

09:50.107 --> 09:52.499
Depending on the road,
he should be here in

09:52.525 --> 09:54.862
time for a midday service
on the property.

09:54.888 --> 09:57.263
Yah, Missy, if you want people
to come back here afterward...

09:57.272 --> 09:59.669
I need to go to the hospital.
I have to call the rabbi.

09:59.708 --> 10:02.966
He said he was leaving right away,
and that was a good half hour ago.

10:02.974 --> 10:05.645
There's supposed to be a minyan,
prayers said in the home.

10:05.740 --> 10:07.554
Yes, I have been
reading about your

10:07.580 --> 10:09.936
funeral practices,
in the encyclopedia.

10:09.974 --> 10:12.005
I need him to find ten men.

10:12.177 --> 10:13.723
Well, ten men, no worry.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.763
Ten Jewish men Roy, to
say Jewish prayers.

10:15.779 --> 10:18.145
The rabbi puts a call out
to the congregation.

10:21.892 --> 10:24.391
Well, we'll try and catch the
rabbi, before he leaves.

10:29.009 --> 10:30.384
Just leave it.

10:31.587 --> 10:32.360
Really.

10:33.275 --> 10:34.688
It's too much trouble now.

10:35.970 --> 10:37.774
I really have made
a mess of this.

10:42.462 --> 10:45.634
Now we're all mum about
George Bligh getting hitched.

10:52.962 --> 10:56.423
Thank you.
Jack, how can I help you?

10:59.251 --> 11:00.516
Well, it's ehm...

11:01.017 --> 11:03.192
.. not a good time
to break bad news.

11:04.247 --> 11:07.536
I'm sorry to have to tell you,
that Rene Nordmann passed away.

11:09.743 --> 11:12.524
Initially, the operation
appeared to be a success, but...

11:13.361 --> 11:15.157
.. there were complications.

11:15.818 --> 11:17.622
There was nothing they could do.

11:18.951 --> 11:22.661
Was Sarah with him, at the time?
- Yes, she was.

11:24.443 --> 11:26.620
The funeral is at midday, today.

11:27.302 --> 11:27.923
I see.

11:27.949 --> 11:30.285
They're gathering at Roy's
later this afternoon.

11:32.543 --> 11:34.448
I appreciate you telling me.

11:35.422 --> 11:37.570
It really is a tragedy,
for all concerned.

11:38.062 --> 11:38.839
Indeed.

11:40.840 --> 11:42.164
I should get going.

11:49.910 --> 11:52.859
This is such a
pleasant surprise.

11:52.910 --> 11:54.761
Please make yourselves at home.

11:56.144 --> 11:57.066
Aah !

11:58.582 --> 12:00.449
I'm afraid, I have
some sad news.

12:01.039 --> 12:02.867
Jack just called by,
to let us know that

12:03.062 --> 12:05.456
Dr. Nordmann has passed away.

12:06.437 --> 12:07.492
Oh my God !

12:07.902 --> 12:10.714
And the burial is at
midday, here in Inverness.

12:11.094 --> 12:12.515
Well, that's very sudden.

12:12.859 --> 12:14.015
It's very Jewish.

12:14.207 --> 12:16.058
We'll all attend of course,
and Jack mentioned

12:16.074 --> 12:18.206
a gathering at Roy's,
later in the afternoon.

12:22.652 --> 12:24.628
I am sorry for you, George.

12:24.730 --> 12:26.831
You are fond of
Sarah, of course.

12:27.972 --> 12:30.745
But in my opinion, we
should not attend.

12:31.019 --> 12:32.940
The papers will
have a field day.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.931
In my experience, a
political campaign

12:35.957 --> 12:38.459
can easily be lost over
petty distractions.

12:39.620 --> 12:43.139
Regina, this is nobody
else's business.

12:43.812 --> 12:47.397
And I don't intend to live my
life in some sort of fishbowl.

12:48.577 --> 12:49.702
I will attend.

12:50.398 --> 12:52.280
They could bring up
the shooting again.

12:53.233 --> 12:55.475
Which would be unfair
on all concerned,

12:55.694 --> 12:57.340
including his widow.

12:59.374 --> 13:00.952
George, this is unfair, but..

13:01.456 --> 13:03.326
.. in the lead-up to the
elections, everything

13:03.352 --> 13:06.340
you do, will be scrutinised
to the n-th degree.

13:11.182 --> 13:12.822
Darling, where are you going?

13:13.034 --> 13:15.142
Riding, to see the new fencing.

13:15.518 --> 13:17.920
I assume, no one has
an objection to that?

13:25.709 --> 13:29.654
Carolyn, thank you for
the congratulations.

13:31.625 --> 13:32.985
Go to hell, Regina !

13:49.480 --> 13:51.050
I didn't expect.

13:51.371 --> 13:54.456
Rene was a decent bloke,
everyone could see that.

13:54.902 --> 13:56.968
And people feel for
you too, Missy.

16:29.666 --> 16:30.755
Are you alright?

16:40.705 --> 16:42.885
Rabbi Cohen.
Can I help you?

16:44.186 --> 16:47.756
Mrs. Nordmann is most upset,
that she didn't have time

16:47.764 --> 16:49.382
to ask you, to
organise a prayer,

16:49.408 --> 16:51.334
I'm sorry I forgot the
name of the word.

16:51.366 --> 16:53.857
A minyan?
That's the one, Sir.

16:53.959 --> 16:56.884
Would it be too late
to arrange, do you think?

17:14.642 --> 17:17.431
I know you wanted the
separate rooms but,

17:20.815 --> 17:22.776
I've missed talking to you.

17:23.940 --> 17:25.505
And this way, we can be...

17:27.315 --> 17:28.651
.. not completely.

17:33.542 --> 17:35.901
It does put things into
perspective, doesn't it?

17:39.480 --> 17:40.338
A funeral.

17:48.362 --> 17:50.947
I can't get that sound
out of my head.

17:54.039 --> 17:56.012
The soil, hitting the coffin.

18:12.461 --> 18:15.320
So sorry to keep you
waiting, Elizabeth.

18:15.477 --> 18:18.164
I've got the painters
working on Anna's old room.

18:19.469 --> 18:21.945
Now, I'm all yours.

18:22.969 --> 18:26.414
I've discussed with George,
the nature of this marriage.

18:27.637 --> 18:29.814
I can accept it, for what it is.

18:30.340 --> 18:32.054
I hope you can do the same.

18:32.578 --> 18:33.851
I embrace it.

18:34.617 --> 18:35.978
Because, if you ever

18:36.602 --> 18:38.857
cause harm, or embarrassment to

18:38.883 --> 18:40.782
George or any member
of my family,

18:40.790 --> 18:42.930
You'll have me drawn
and quartered.

18:44.071 --> 18:46.352
Or skinned alive, if you prefer.

18:49.016 --> 18:51.193
Thank you for the motherly chat.

18:54.440 --> 18:55.985
You do realise
that a marriage of

18:56.011 --> 18:58.277
this nature, can
be easily annulled?

19:08.574 --> 19:10.738
A gentleman here to see
Mrs Bligh Sr, sir.

19:10.909 --> 19:13.003
He called Mrs Bligh
by her first name.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.268
May I help you?

19:17.722 --> 19:20.103
- George Bligh.
- Douglas Goddard.

19:21.152 --> 19:24.089
I see from the paper,
congratulations are in order.

19:24.460 --> 19:27.663
The wedding yesterday and of
course, your pre-selection.

19:27.745 --> 19:28.426
Thank you.

19:29.152 --> 19:31.464
Not that I bat for
your team, I'm afraid.

19:32.011 --> 19:34.120
You're a friend of my mother's?

19:34.363 --> 19:35.612
Mr Goddard?

19:36.535 --> 19:38.323
This is a surprise.

19:41.171 --> 19:43.979
I realise you're on
your way out, ehm..

19:44.300 --> 19:46.581
Not at all, we have a
family friend in mourning.

19:46.757 --> 19:49.538
I would having to pay my respect
sometime this afternoon.

19:49.913 --> 19:50.682
Aha.

19:51.144 --> 19:51.892
Of course.

19:52.597 --> 19:53.682
Sorry, I'm...

19:55.999 --> 19:57.886
Ah, before I forget.

19:58.074 --> 20:01.135
It is another one of
your lady archeologists.

20:01.890 --> 20:05.358
Kathleen Kenyon,
excavating in Jericho

20:05.890 --> 20:09.022
- Last week's London Times.
- Thank you.

20:11.041 --> 20:12.334
It's a bit creased.

20:12.987 --> 20:15.943
I did bring it along to the
knees-up, but you were AWOL.

20:16.221 --> 20:18.713
Yes, I'm sorry I couldn't
attend the fundraiser.

20:19.139 --> 20:20.740
Family matters intervened.

20:20.944 --> 20:23.393
A marvelous result.
Most gratifying.

20:23.506 --> 20:26.023
Yeah, keep it going
for another year.

20:27.108 --> 20:29.162
You go, certainly
now you're staff.

20:31.869 --> 20:34.603
You came all this way, just
to give me a clipping?

20:35.326 --> 20:35.959
No, no.

20:37.295 --> 20:38.998
To ask you, to run away with me.

20:41.014 --> 20:43.006
To a concert tomorrow
night, actually.

20:44.588 --> 20:46.289
Beethoven's 5th Symphony.

20:47.194 --> 20:51.004
Eugene Goossens conducting the
Sydney Symphony Orchestra

20:52.608 --> 20:55.498
You came all this way, to
invite me to a concert?

20:56.869 --> 20:58.478
Well, it's a first
step of course.

20:59.998 --> 21:02.853
To see if we can't make
some sort of a go of it

21:04.041 --> 21:05.402
Oh Douglas, I ehm...

21:06.237 --> 21:08.141
I am not who you think I am.

21:08.459 --> 21:09.818
Well, you're not perfect.

21:10.381 --> 21:12.354
Not like the rest of us, hmm?

21:13.116 --> 21:15.443
I don't treat people well.

21:15.807 --> 21:16.895
Well, you could.

21:19.588 --> 21:22.533
Elizabeth, unlike a
lot of other people

21:22.760 --> 21:23.848
you're curious.

21:24.811 --> 21:26.818
You're well read, got
a sense of humour.

21:27.511 --> 21:29.222
You'd rather drop
dead in your tracks

21:29.248 --> 21:30.942
than let anyone get too close.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.964
It's perfectly understandable,
it's just that..

21:35.374 --> 21:38.960
we can live smaller, safer
lives until we cark it.

21:40.574 --> 21:43.761
Or we can share some
parts of ourselves.

21:45.093 --> 21:47.100
Share some of our dreams.

21:52.214 --> 21:53.575
Father wants a word.

21:54.417 --> 21:55.487
Glad you could stay.

21:56.523 --> 21:58.030
Tell him, you're happy for him.

21:59.054 --> 22:01.733
I'll never call her stepmother.
EVER.

22:04.941 --> 22:07.097
Ah, there she is.

22:07.785 --> 22:08.854
Hello father.

22:11.390 --> 22:12.887
I wanted a quiet word.

22:13.218 --> 22:15.507
To reassure you, that
my marriage to Regina,

22:15.663 --> 22:17.296
it changes nothing.
- Really.

22:17.562 --> 22:18.990
In terms of Ash Park,

22:19.320 --> 22:21.554
your trust, your inheritance.

22:22.242 --> 22:24.843
Now, the solicitor was here this
morning, and we've made and..

22:24.960 --> 22:27.018
signed new wills, as one must.

22:27.367 --> 22:30.468
But our wills and our finances
are completely independent.

22:31.898 --> 22:33.122
Do you understand?

22:35.585 --> 22:36.710
Any questions?

22:38.156 --> 22:40.015
I'm very disappointed in you.

22:40.679 --> 22:41.538
And you !

23:23.652 --> 23:26.128
She loved him, since
they were children.

23:26.242 --> 23:29.757
Her certainty, that one day
they'd marry, had never wavered.

23:29.851 --> 23:32.293
The conviction, that the feelings
they had, for one another,

23:32.319 --> 23:35.217
was stronger than anything,
she had ever known.

23:37.651 --> 23:40.518
Now, it all seemed
like such hard work.

23:40.850 --> 23:45.154
What was once his pride, now
seems like plain stubbornness.

23:46.674 --> 23:49.529
The voice in her head,
repeated over and over again,

23:49.555 --> 23:51.156
that she may have
made a mistake.

23:51.180 --> 23:53.164
Was there a way
out of this mess?

23:53.336 --> 23:55.578
His silence was more
than she could bear.

23:55.621 --> 23:58.152
Her anger at his attitude
rose within her...

23:58.168 --> 24:00.558
.. Beth was furious. Their
neighbour had left no doubt...

24:00.574 --> 24:01.902
..she felt, she no
longer needed him...

24:01.910 --> 24:04.464
..perhaps her family had
been right all along.

24:04.574 --> 24:06.902
She longed for home.

24:09.770 --> 24:12.199
I appreciate your
visit very much.

24:14.199 --> 24:15.316
And the dish.

24:19.770 --> 24:22.082
My dear, this is the
hardest of days.

24:26.621 --> 24:28.322
My heart goes out to you.

24:31.277 --> 24:32.019
I'm sorry.

24:37.951 --> 24:40.029
Sarah, you did everything
you could, for him.

24:42.271 --> 24:43.972
And if I may be so bold,

24:45.533 --> 24:47.224
At least, you have
a part of him,

24:47.250 --> 24:49.241
to carry with you through life.

24:49.748 --> 24:50.950
To give you joy.

24:58.553 --> 24:59.341
Yes.

25:00.912 --> 25:04.005
If there's anything at all that
you need, you let me know.

25:26.295 --> 25:28.415
Rose, could you call
the car, please.

25:29.146 --> 25:30.794
Where are you off to, George?

25:30.795 --> 25:32.428
I'll be back for dinner.

25:42.427 --> 25:44.286
He will not be forgotten.

25:44.732 --> 25:46.365
For that is not our way.

25:47.068 --> 25:49.721
His loved ones, we'll
draw close to us.

25:52.603 --> 25:54.372
We'll not forget this day.

25:55.865 --> 25:59.263
For Dr. Rene Nordmann.
May he rest in peace.

25:59.896 --> 26:01.911
For Dr. Rene Nordmann !

26:06.880 --> 26:10.075
Sarah, we all feel
so much for you.

26:10.755 --> 26:12.700
You were so brave.
I was?

26:13.365 --> 26:14.169
Excuse me.

26:16.884 --> 26:18.712
You think it's alright
to make a prayer?

26:20.588 --> 26:21.509
Hi everyone !

26:22.025 --> 26:24.962
Missy would like to
lead us in a prayer.

26:28.443 --> 26:31.396
Now, traditionally, this
prayer, the mourners' kadish,

26:31.420 --> 26:33.474
should be said, by a
group of Jewish men,

26:33.482 --> 26:34.843
for the woman alone.

26:35.279 --> 26:38.732
But given, that Rene and I, didn't
exactly live traditional lives,

26:41.384 --> 26:43.235
(In Hebrew)

26:52.728 --> 26:53.885
(Have they come?)

27:02.982 --> 27:04.618
Mrs. Nordmann?
Ah no,

27:05.197 --> 27:09.778
This is Mrs. Nordmann,
Dr. Nordmann's widow.

27:13.111 --> 27:14.517
Mrs. Nordmann,

27:15.580 --> 27:17.251
I wish you a long life.

27:35.341 --> 27:38.153
Thank you so much, for
coming all this way.

27:39.540 --> 27:41.008
(In Hebrew)

28:14.165 --> 28:16.821
May his memory be a blessing.

28:19.719 --> 28:20.601
Thank you.

28:25.266 --> 28:27.156
G'day mate, Roy Briggs.

28:27.610 --> 28:28.942
Thanks for coming down.

28:31.790 --> 28:34.399
James Bligh.
This is my father George Bligh.

28:34.446 --> 28:35.875
Welcome to Inverness.

28:39.462 --> 28:41.469
Carolyn, can we talk?

28:41.852 --> 28:44.477
Perhaps later, I'm not
feeling very well.

28:44.485 --> 28:46.571
Would you mind,
driving Anna home?

29:02.360 --> 29:03.297
Excuse me.

29:04.333 --> 29:05.254
So sad.

29:18.341 --> 29:19.905
Where shall I put this?

29:22.610 --> 29:24.469
In the kitchen please, Regina.

29:25.208 --> 29:27.317
Actually dear, it's Mrs. Bligh.

29:27.430 --> 29:28.899
George and I are married.

29:31.208 --> 29:33.379
Oh, I'm sorry.

29:33.841 --> 29:35.762
I thought, you would have known.

29:40.372 --> 29:41.778
Why are you here?

29:48.907 --> 29:50.297
Why are you here?

29:51.661 --> 29:53.702
- To pay my respects.
- Liar.

29:55.286 --> 29:56.340
LIAR !!

30:00.251 --> 30:02.496
Take this woman from this house !

30:02.618 --> 30:04.852
It's time to go.
NOW.

30:08.716 --> 30:11.485
I'm not sure, why I should apologise.
You heard what she called me.

30:11.511 --> 30:12.875
She's just buried her husband.

30:12.883 --> 30:14.164
I thought she knew,
I thought ...

30:14.188 --> 30:17.086
I tend to defend you out of
diplomacy, but in this situation...

30:19.508 --> 30:21.759
Have you been enjoying
the garden, Mr Goddard?

30:21.785 --> 30:22.746
Oh yes.

30:22.969 --> 30:25.867
I now know everything I'll ever
need to know, about roses.

30:26.481 --> 30:28.895
I'm not convinced you
listened to a word I said.

30:29.247 --> 30:32.496
Oh yes, the red ones
are called red.

30:33.657 --> 30:36.240
George, do you remember, when the
Goddard catalogue used to arrive?

30:36.266 --> 30:38.570
All of George's school
uniforms came from you.

30:39.103 --> 30:41.767
If only I had known, I could
have thrown in a pair of socks.

30:42.876 --> 30:45.329
If you'll excuse me.
Of course.

30:46.919 --> 30:48.849
You will stay the
night, won't you?

30:49.119 --> 30:51.337
I was planning on taking
a room at the pub.

30:51.642 --> 30:56.239
We insist. Rose, prepare the blue
room for Mr Goddard, please.

30:56.697 --> 30:58.057
If you'll excuse me.

31:00.427 --> 31:01.924
What a charming woman.

31:48.192 --> 31:53.481
To Sarah Nordmann, I give, devise and
bequeath, finances held in trust,

31:53.739 --> 31:56.695
on behalf of our unborn
child, for maintenance,

31:56.712 --> 32:00.563
education, advancement and
benefit, reaching the age of 21.

32:38.235 --> 32:40.125
I'm sorry you found
out like that.

32:42.204 --> 32:44.094
What were you thinking, George?

32:45.739 --> 32:48.621
The fact is, to have a
successful political career,

32:48.833 --> 32:50.601
I need someone by my side.

32:52.485 --> 32:53.278
Regina and I...

32:53.304 --> 32:55.435
You of all people,
know what she's like.

32:55.524 --> 32:56.961
It's a pragmatic union.

32:57.352 --> 32:59.548
This is a woman, who
has never called me

32:59.574 --> 33:02.212
anything other than
'The Jew' and worse.

33:02.238 --> 33:03.337
You have a right to be angry.

33:03.353 --> 33:05.282
Yes I have a right to be angry.

33:06.291 --> 33:09.353
At you !
And Rene !

33:12.591 --> 33:14.156
You need to know the...

33:14.716 --> 33:16.607
.. you and the baby
will be looked after.

33:17.459 --> 33:19.567
It is almost laughable, really.

33:22.201 --> 33:26.091
Rene and I were so close, to
having some sort of a family life.

33:27.580 --> 33:29.008
And now, I'm a widow.

33:29.978 --> 33:31.622
Having a child, on my own.

33:31.724 --> 33:32.962
You won't be on your own.

33:33.181 --> 33:35.392
Because no matter how
charitable you may feel

33:35.426 --> 33:37.517
towards me, or to the baby,

33:38.317 --> 33:39.988
we WILL be on our own.

33:40.004 --> 33:41.365
It won't be charity.

33:45.249 --> 33:46.115
Anyway,

33:51.409 --> 33:53.221
.. I've just buried my husband.

33:56.220 --> 33:56.838
But...

34:02.464 --> 34:03.971
.. go home, George.

34:06.069 --> 34:07.566
Go home, to your wife.

34:30.033 --> 34:31.572
Thank you so much for this.

34:32.135 --> 34:33.126
A pleasure.

34:34.842 --> 34:36.708
You seemed rather sad at dinner.

34:38.556 --> 34:39.110
Oh.

34:41.228 --> 34:42.087
Elizabeth?

34:45.193 --> 34:46.918
I'm sad for my son.

34:50.982 --> 34:52.896
From what you've told
me, your marriage

34:53.161 --> 34:55.022
was a very affectionate one.

34:59.740 --> 35:02.298
Unfortunately my late
husband and I, were not

35:02.744 --> 35:06.001
particularly demonstrative.

35:07.427 --> 35:09.033
One does worry about the example

35:09.059 --> 35:10.764
that one has set one's children.

35:20.957 --> 35:23.293
Were you not allowed,
to chose your husband?

35:26.407 --> 35:28.640
Was there someone else,
you'd rather had married?

35:31.914 --> 35:32.953
You know...

35:35.153 --> 35:37.676
Everyone deserves a
chance at happiness.

35:42.477 --> 35:46.265
So, are we going to the
concert, tomorrow night?

35:46.860 --> 35:49.687
Oh darling, I really feel
as though I'm needed here.

35:50.672 --> 35:53.053
But I do appreciate
the invitation.

35:54.020 --> 35:56.449
And I look forward to
hearing all about it.

35:58.082 --> 36:00.871
Goodnight, Douglas.

36:06.402 --> 36:07.554
Goodnight James.

36:08.867 --> 36:09.547
Goodnight.

37:29.371 --> 37:30.732
Where are you going?

37:31.598 --> 37:33.031
Sydney, I told you.

37:33.293 --> 37:35.538
The Agricultural
Society meeting.

37:36.977 --> 37:38.230
I'll be back tomorrow.

38:10.555 --> 38:13.199
No breakfast this morning?
No.

38:17.422 --> 38:19.586
Are you alright, George?
Yes.

38:23.223 --> 38:24.851
Here, let me.

38:48.524 --> 38:49.101
Good.

38:50.274 --> 38:52.367
Shall we go through your
schedule a little later?

38:52.406 --> 38:55.613
No, no, this is having
the desired effect.

39:00.532 --> 39:04.176
Now, Sir Richard thinks your wireless
interviews have been excellent.

39:04.590 --> 39:05.644
Does he now?

39:06.442 --> 39:08.480
I've set up three
more, for next week.

39:08.864 --> 39:11.426
And if you approve, I put
them into your diary,

39:11.496 --> 39:13.730
and my duplicate.

39:13.793 --> 39:16.258
Where would I be, without
a duplicate diary?

39:19.399 --> 39:21.372
I'm sure, you'd muddle along.

39:28.824 --> 39:30.129
Oh, goodness me !

39:30.371 --> 39:32.808
Oh sorry, I didn't
mean to frighten you.

39:35.946 --> 39:38.344
Carolyn, will you tell
me how I can help you.

39:42.207 --> 39:43.910
Whatever it is.

39:44.160 --> 39:45.066
I can't.

39:51.504 --> 39:53.886
Darling, something's happened.

39:56.211 --> 39:57.039
Tell me.

39:59.996 --> 40:02.136
I just need you to hold me.

40:37.520 --> 40:38.410
Stardust.

40:43.532 --> 40:44.586
Stardust !

40:45.516 --> 40:47.500
Hey, that's my horse !

40:48.203 --> 40:49.187
Stardust !

40:49.867 --> 40:50.765
Rider !

40:52.340 --> 40:55.230
Gino, guess what
I've just seen ?

40:55.992 --> 40:58.367
Well, I just met the
new owner of Stardust.

41:00.930 --> 41:02.398
It's just for the girl to try her out.

41:02.424 --> 41:03.782
Carlo wants his money
back now I have

41:03.808 --> 41:05.058
to show I can pay
my debt somehow.

41:05.065 --> 41:06.845
Stardust is MY horse !

41:06.924 --> 41:07.908
She's mine !

41:08.330 --> 41:11.689
Whatever made you think, that
you have a right to do that?

41:11.955 --> 41:14.154
Do you have any idea,
what that horse is worth?

41:14.357 --> 41:16.740
Gino, I can get us money !

41:16.779 --> 41:17.919
Gino's in debt father.

41:17.945 --> 41:19.474
I have to bail him
out father huh?!

41:19.490 --> 41:20.630
No, it's not like that !

41:20.656 --> 41:22.633
It's exactly like that. I know
what goes on in your head.

41:22.638 --> 41:24.232
Well, clearly you don't !

41:25.088 --> 41:25.939
Gino !

41:28.775 --> 41:29.673
It's all in here.

41:29.728 --> 41:32.032
That is a novel.
 It's a story.

41:32.103 --> 41:33.325
You're lucky I didn't burn it.

41:33.334 --> 41:34.482
How long have you
been reading it?

41:34.511 --> 41:35.638
No one reads this rubbish.

41:35.662 --> 41:36.786
RUBBISH ??!!

41:36.917 --> 41:37.682
Gino !!

41:37.706 --> 41:39.831
Hey. You don't show
it to any one.

41:39.840 --> 41:41.379
You don't read it, to any one.

41:41.387 --> 41:43.348
I will show it, to who ever I want !

41:43.368 --> 41:45.890
And I've already sent the first
two chapters to a publisher !

41:45.914 --> 41:47.207
It should be burnt.

41:47.250 --> 41:49.359
No !
This is a princess, slumming it.

41:49.383 --> 41:51.007
Looking down her nose at everything !

41:51.016 --> 41:52.542
Looking down her nose at ME ?

41:52.563 --> 41:55.190
Everything that he has worked
for, hand it over to her !

41:55.215 --> 41:57.214
Give it to me, that's my work !

41:57.226 --> 41:58.640
Anna, hey Anna !

42:04.560 --> 42:05.309
Bella.

42:07.575 --> 42:08.724
Bella, I'm sorry.

42:09.310 --> 42:11.036
I'm so sorry, Bella.

42:14.771 --> 42:17.083
Anna please.
Cara, forgive me.

42:54.605 --> 42:57.527
That's his favourite.
Off you go.

43:16.434 --> 43:18.144
Sweetheart, what..?
