blame the greenies for
stopping hazard burns.

there is a climate change influence.

the fires are deliberately lit.

I'll try him from the hill.

so he's not going to be able

04:43.400 --> 04:44.640

Well, at least you have
somewhere to stay.

would it have...

05:48.440 --> 05:50.480

When we bought this place
for Lachlan, it meant other costs

07:05.880 --> 07:08.000
Yep.
It's alright, though.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.440
It'll be good for them to just hang
out with us and eat some yummy food.

08:56.040 --> 08:58.000
Yeah, we just wanna get involved.
Not...

Unless you wanna...

09:01.040 --> 09:02.040
No.

What can we do to help, mate?

over there.

My big brother...

43:04.360 --> 43:05.840
..he was Superman.

43:07.160 --> 43:08.560
He wasn't supposed to die.

43:10.920 --> 43:13.400
Why did he take a risk
on that road?

43:14.400 --> 43:15.920
What was he fuckin' thinking?

43:15.920 --> 43:18.400
I know, darling, I know.

43:19.720 --> 43:21.520
Dad, come back.

43:21.520 --> 43:23.160
Yeah?

43:23.160 --> 43:24.800
Yeah, I'm here, mate.

43:25.840 --> 43:27.640
I'll stay as long
as you guys need me.

44:05.080 --> 44:07.720
I'm just picking up some stuff.

44:07.720 --> 44:09.200
DUNCAN: Right.

44:10.440 --> 44:13.040
We saw you on the news.

44:13.040 --> 44:15.360
Did they pay you for it?

44:15.360 --> 44:16.560
No.

44:17.880 --> 44:20.760
I can't believe that they'd...

44:20.760 --> 44:22.760
..think about...

44:22.760 --> 44:24.360
..taking you out to the car.

44:24.360 --> 44:25.840
That was my idea.

44:25.840 --> 44:27.840
You didn't want them here.

44:29.840 --> 44:33.680
Anyway, that's my business.
Has nothing to do with you guys.

44:37.160 --> 44:39.880
Why didn't you tell us you spoke
to Lachie that afternoon?

44:41.280 --> 44:42.360
What?

44:42.360 --> 44:44.640
Well, we all thought Duncan
was the last one to speak to him

44:44.640 --> 44:46.120
in the morning.

44:46.120 --> 44:48.640
But on the news, you said
that you spoke to him from here

44:48.640 --> 44:50.400
in the afternoon.

44:50.400 --> 44:51.840
What does it matter?

44:51.840 --> 44:53.800
I don't know why
you wouldn't tell us.

44:54.800 --> 44:57.480
I've been thinking,
why would he come back here?

44:57.480 --> 45:02.040
Why would he take that shitty road
when the fire is bloody everywhere?

45:02.040 --> 45:05.560
Connor thought the same thing.
Did you speak to him, Brooke?

45:05.560 --> 45:07.040
We just wanna know.

45:08.360 --> 45:09.680
Y-yes.

45:09.680 --> 45:10.920
Right.

45:12.200 --> 45:14.560
And...and where was he?

45:16.840 --> 45:19.360
In the car. Driving.

45:20.600 --> 45:23.680
So he-he would have hit
the road block and then...

45:23.680 --> 45:25.640
..gone in through the fire trails?

45:28.320 --> 45:29.960
I-I guess.

45:29.960 --> 45:31.440
What'd you say to him?

45:38.400 --> 45:41.200
The smoke, it was so th...

45:41.200 --> 45:42.680
..thick.

45:44.040 --> 45:45.760
I was alone here.

45:47.560 --> 45:50.400
Lachlan told me he was coming back
to get us. He...

45:51.600 --> 45:53.760
He said you guys needed him.

45:53.760 --> 45:57.520
You needed the pump
because YOU wanted to stay and fight.

45:57.520 --> 46:01.600
Did you ask him to come and get you?
I-I wanted him here. I...

46:01.600 --> 46:04.120
I-I told him to come, I did.

46:04.120 --> 46:06.080
Did you tell him that we
were being evacuated?

46:06.080 --> 46:07.520
That we couldn't stay?

46:07.520 --> 46:10.280
He would have done anything
to come back and get me.

46:10.280 --> 46:11.920
You have no idea.

46:11.920 --> 46:14.120
Oh, we know, Brooke.
We know Lachlan.

46:14.120 --> 46:15.840
But you don't know me!

46:15.840 --> 46:17.920
You don't know anything about me!

46:17.920 --> 46:21.320
I've lived here for two years!
This isn't getting us anywhere.

46:21.320 --> 46:23.560
We were gonna get married
and you still treat me

46:23.560 --> 46:27.240
like I'm some kind of one-night stand
or something!

46:27.240 --> 46:29.040
You had him wrapped around
your little finger!

46:29.040 --> 46:30.920
That's enough.
You have no idea!

46:30.920 --> 46:32.760
We had to manage you.

46:32.760 --> 46:35.440
Tiptoe around you and your moods,

46:35.440 --> 46:38.200
judging everything we said and did.

46:38.200 --> 46:41.360
It would drive him nuts.
Oh.

46:41.360 --> 46:43.760
We talked about leaving here
all the time,

46:43.760 --> 46:46.720
just to get away from YOU!
Oh, Jesus Christ!

46:48.320 --> 46:49.600
Between the two of you,

46:49.600 --> 46:51.680
you're gonna tear this place apart.
Both of us?!

46:51.680 --> 46:54.320
You're just looking for somebody to
blame. There's nobody to blame!

46:54.320 --> 46:55.480
No!
Alright.

46:55.480 --> 46:58.440
You going after Archie?
I mean, he's a kid.

46:58.440 --> 47:01.120
And you having a go,
just having a go.

47:01.120 --> 47:03.560
Where's your compassion?

47:05.960 --> 47:08.280
I don't have any room for it!

47:08.280 --> 47:11.280
I don't have space for it!

47:11.280 --> 47:14.440
I...can't stand it.

47:14.440 --> 47:17.440
My heart is fucking breaking!

47:19.360 --> 47:20.720
(CRIES)

47:54.960 --> 47:57.600
This Sunday,

47:57.600 --> 48:00.640
you guys were going to come here
for dinner.

48:00.640 --> 48:03.000
Lachie was gonna buy some champagne.

48:04.840 --> 48:06.720
We were gonna give you this.

48:30.440 --> 48:32.120
You're pregnant?

48:32.120 --> 48:33.600
Yes.

48:34.840 --> 48:36.960
10 weeks.

48:36.960 --> 48:39.800
Actually, 11 now.

48:43.320 --> 48:45.240
They were Lachie's idea.

48:45.240 --> 48:47.280
He thought it'd be funny,

48:47.280 --> 48:49.560
thinking about the two of you
wearing them.

48:50.760 --> 48:53.280
I said you never would,
not in a million years.

49:24.200 --> 49:25.960
Here, mate.

49:25.960 --> 49:28.960
Yum. Thanks, Dad.
Hold up.

49:31.120 --> 49:34.680
What?
Your shirt.

49:34.680 --> 49:37.880
Not that anybody'd notice
any difference.

49:37.880 --> 49:39.520
Well, come on then.

49:41.800 --> 49:43.160
(CHUCKLES)

49:45.480 --> 49:47.160
Breakfast's up!

49:53.120 --> 49:54.760
BROOKE: Nothing for me, thanks.

49:58.080 --> 50:00.360
Is she alright?

50:00.360 --> 50:02.080
She's OK.

50:04.760 --> 50:07.080
I'm so glad you're here, matey.

50:23.160 --> 50:25.120
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)

50:29.360 --> 50:31.040
KATH: I'm sorry, this is your room.

50:36.040 --> 50:37.840
You look nice.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.440
How're you feeling?

50:44.680 --> 50:46.760
Like I just want today to be over.

50:47.880 --> 50:49.320
Same.

50:53.840 --> 50:55.520
Brooke...

50:55.520 --> 50:57.440
..I owe you an apology.

50:59.040 --> 51:01.760
I never took you and Lachie
seriously.

51:01.760 --> 51:03.760
I don't know why.

51:03.760 --> 51:06.080
Even when you moved in,

51:06.080 --> 51:09.040
even when you started talking
about getting married.

51:11.200 --> 51:13.280
I suppose I thought that

51:13.280 --> 51:15.320
we'd have all these years

51:15.320 --> 51:16.800
ahead of us together and...

51:18.160 --> 51:19.640
..time would sort us out.

51:20.920 --> 51:22.320
Me too.

51:25.760 --> 51:27.520
Lachie adored you.

51:28.680 --> 51:32.320
He loved the farm.
He loved this place.

51:32.320 --> 51:34.080
He would never have left.

51:46.160 --> 51:47.800
Let's get through this.

51:54.960 --> 51:56.960
(REFLECTIVE MUSIC)

52:29.560 --> 52:31.440
G'day, mate.
How are ya?

52:35.240 --> 52:36.880
Thanks for coming.

53:12.440 --> 53:14.640
We'll head down.

53:14.640 --> 53:16.640
Yeah, yeah, good-oh.

54:31.160 --> 54:34.400
GARY: Prediction for tomorrow
is an uncomfortable 40 degrees.

54:34.400 --> 54:36.960
LALLY: If you leave now, you'll get
there and back by morning.

54:36.960 --> 54:38.920
Conditions are unpredictable,
to say the least.

54:38.920 --> 54:41.080
There's a leave-now order in place
for all Woolley's Bay.

54:41.080 --> 54:42.440
You need to evacuate immediately.

54:42.440 --> 54:44.840
I don't know what else to do.
You'd be really helping me out.

54:44.840 --> 54:47.920
We're staying to defend. My partner's
on his way back from Canberra.

54:47.920 --> 54:50.200
You say you know what to do
but you have no idea what it's like.

54:50.200 --> 54:52.240
If you get into trouble,
we won't be able to get to you.

54:52.240 --> 54:54.440
Probably taken the back road.
There's a back road?!

54:54.440 --> 54:55.680
Maybe I should leave.

54:55.680 --> 54:57.920
ADRIAN: Lally, I'm gonna come back
and we're gonna defend.

54:57.920 --> 54:59.520
BEC: Do you smell smoke?

54:59.520 --> 55:02.560
Woolley's Bay, it is no longer safe
to leave.

55:02.560 --> 55:05.440
You're not just car sick, are you?

55:05.440 --> 55:07.240
What's the way now?
Um...

55:07.240 --> 55:08.480
Do you know?
