00:15.713 --> 00:17.195
Previously on "Imposters"...

00:17.226 --> 00:19.233
The Doctor wants the ring.

00:19.235 --> 00:20.943
- That's it?
- That's it.

00:20.945 --> 00:22.149
Just get the saffron diamond ring,

00:22.151 --> 00:23.557
deliver it to the Doctor,

00:23.559 --> 00:25.400
and then you can go your
bumbling little way.

00:25.402 --> 00:27.343
Easy-peasy.

00:27.345 --> 00:28.952
See you soon, macaroon.

00:28.954 --> 00:30.595
I'm Shelly. Shelly Cohen.

00:30.597 --> 00:32.940
I'm fairly confident
you know my ex-wife.

00:32.942 --> 00:35.018
You're Lenny Cohen's husband?

00:35.020 --> 00:36.526
- Ex-husband.
- Ex-husband.

00:36.528 --> 00:37.665
Bingo.

00:37.667 --> 00:39.475
You know this man I work for,

00:39.477 --> 00:40.480
the Doctor?

00:40.482 --> 00:42.189
I'm gonna kill him.

00:42.191 --> 00:44.367
We're gonna find out who he
is and what makes him tick,

00:44.369 --> 00:47.618
and before we deliver him to the FBI,

00:47.620 --> 00:49.328
we'll take him for everything he's got.

00:49.330 --> 00:51.036
- Agent Simons?
- Mr. Bloom.

00:51.038 --> 00:52.478
You know the same truth that I do.

00:52.480 --> 00:54.086
None of us can move on
until this thing is done.

00:54.088 --> 00:55.494
Tell me what you're thinking.

00:55.496 --> 00:57.269
There's this Northeast
Biannual Conference

00:57.271 --> 00:59.816
of Orthopedic Surgeons in two weeks,
Niagara Falls.

00:59.818 --> 01:01.761
There's a very prestigious
award being given away

01:01.763 --> 01:04.105
- called the Egan Award.
- Jeffery?

01:04.108 --> 01:05.279
The Doctor thinks he's winning.

01:05.281 --> 01:06.687
This is Harry Price.

01:06.689 --> 01:08.798
The committee has decided to...

01:08.800 --> 01:12.317
reward your understanding
with this year's Egan Award.

01:12.319 --> 01:13.344
I'd be delighted.

01:13.459 --> 01:15.836
Meanwhile,
we'll infiltrate his headquarters.

01:15.838 --> 01:17.779
- Looks like the basement.
- Top left pocket.

01:17.781 --> 01:19.589
I think it's his father.

01:19.591 --> 01:21.633
Wipe our info, steal the money,

01:21.635 --> 01:24.481
and then we'll plant the ring on him,
deliver him to the Feds easy-peasy.

01:24.483 --> 01:25.923
Any questions?

01:25.925 --> 01:27.497
No questions, great.

01:27.499 --> 01:30.849
How is making all the money we need
in three days not smart?

01:30.851 --> 01:32.927
Yo, I think he's actually
getting off on this.

01:32.929 --> 01:34.367
Nobody who gets conned is innocent.

01:34.369 --> 01:36.009
They all wanted something for cheap.

01:36.011 --> 01:37.686
Okay, now you're starting
to sound like our ex-wife.

01:37.688 --> 01:39.830
- Do you have the ring?
- It's within reach.

01:39.832 --> 01:41.640
Good. And Max?

01:41.642 --> 01:43.483
He doesn't suspect a thing.

01:43.485 --> 01:45.862
None of them do.

01:45.864 --> 01:47.672
I know what you're doing.

01:47.674 --> 01:50.119
- Yeah, what's that?
- You're gonna kill the Doctor.

01:52.734 --> 01:54.575
We have a problem.

02:00.576 --> 02:04.428
There's a famous quote
from one of my favorite writers.

02:04.430 --> 02:07.511
"No man, for any considerable period,"

02:07.513 --> 02:09.655
"can wear one face to himself"

02:09.657 --> 02:11.633
"and another to the multitude"

02:11.635 --> 02:14.950
"without finally getting bewildered
as to which may be the true."

02:26.715 --> 02:28.859
And that's the problem, isn't it?

02:28.861 --> 02:30.903
If you play dress-up long enough,

02:30.905 --> 02:34.924
you're bound to get lost
in your disguise.

02:34.926 --> 02:37.705
Like passing out in your
Halloween costume

02:37.707 --> 02:40.889
and not recognizing
yourself in the morning.

02:40.891 --> 02:45.682
And sure, there's a certain comfort
in hiding behind a mask,

02:45.684 --> 02:48.831
a relief that we don't
have to be ourselves

02:48.833 --> 02:51.714
all the time, but...

02:51.716 --> 02:55.064
does it get to a point that
you forget who you really are?

02:56.708 --> 02:59.723
I mean, I fell for you in Mexico,

02:59.725 --> 03:04.079
and it felt true, but you and I,

03:04.081 --> 03:06.760
we lied to each other
from the moment we met.

03:06.762 --> 03:10.179
About our lives, our names.

03:10.181 --> 03:12.491
We even stole from each other.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.837
But what if my heart was lying too?

03:14.839 --> 03:18.255
How can we even know what
we actually feel anymore?

03:18.257 --> 03:20.366
Sorry, I didn't hear. What?

03:20.368 --> 03:22.008
You kidding me?
I was just pouring my heart...

03:22.010 --> 03:24.052
Just kidding, baby dog eyes.

03:26.367 --> 03:28.007
I heard you.

03:31.963 --> 03:33.972
When today's over,

03:33.974 --> 03:36.419
no matter what happens,

03:36.421 --> 03:38.999
meet me at the ferry boats at 5:00.

03:39.001 --> 03:41.110
I promise I'll be there.

03:47.547 --> 03:49.186
You're saying that like I speak Spanish.

03:49.188 --> 03:50.326
You know I don't.

03:50.328 --> 03:51.399
I said...

03:51.401 --> 03:52.672
that I'd think about it.

03:56.059 --> 04:00.078
Don't you know that a man being rich
is like a girl being beautiful?

04:00.080 --> 04:02.223
You wouldn't marry a girl
just because she's pretty,

04:02.225 --> 04:04.166
but my goodness, doesn't it help?

04:05.542 --> 04:07.753
- You're real good.
- Thank you.

04:07.755 --> 04:09.763
- Megan.
- Norma Jean.

04:09.765 --> 04:12.109
How do you do?

04:12.111 --> 04:14.220
I like doing the Marilyn thing,

04:14.222 --> 04:16.801
but sometimes the lines
get real fuzzy, you know?

04:16.803 --> 04:19.146
I'm with some nice guy.

04:19.148 --> 04:22.531
Who does he want to be with,
me or Marilyn?

04:23.874 --> 04:26.552
You know,
a very smart woman once told me

04:26.554 --> 04:29.871
that each of us has an authentic self.

04:29.873 --> 04:32.752
Sometimes we lose touch with it, right?

04:32.754 --> 04:36.974
But the trick is, you have to find it.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.454
Sure, but how do you find it
if you didn't know

04:39.456 --> 04:41.264
what it was to begin with?

04:42.775 --> 04:46.358
I like your look.
You could go far, Marilyn.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.637
Thank you, Marilyn.

04:49.494 --> 04:52.424
But I'm done playing dress-up.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.770
I'm getting out of the game.

04:54.772 --> 04:56.680
I'm getting out for good.

05:02.312 --> 05:05.058
Yes, after the reception,
we'll video conference.

05:05.060 --> 05:08.744
It's time I met these
bumblers face-to-face.

05:08.746 --> 05:11.760
And, Sally, in terms of the FBI,

05:11.762 --> 05:14.944
let's be ready to run
the Periwinkle option.

05:14.946 --> 05:16.552
Yes.

05:16.554 --> 05:17.692
I'll be in touch.

05:21.749 --> 05:22.784
Welcome, Dr. Hull.

05:22.788 --> 05:25.567
I'm Alessandra from the OSA,
Northeast Chapter.

05:25.569 --> 05:28.182
I've been assigned to take care
of you during the convention.

05:28.184 --> 05:30.226
So nice to meet you.

05:30.228 --> 05:32.203
Richard covers for Maddie

05:32.205 --> 05:34.046
with the real Egan winner,
and everything's covered.

05:34.048 --> 05:36.090
I think we should tell Sally and Max

05:36.092 --> 05:38.135
that she wants to kill the Doctor.

05:38.137 --> 05:41.620
We tell 'em, and Sally might just go
and blow Maddie's brains out.

05:41.622 --> 05:42.859
I'm not kidding.

05:42.861 --> 05:44.636
She wouldn't. She loves Maddie.

05:44.638 --> 05:47.049
Hey, close the curtains.
The view isn't right.

05:47.051 --> 05:48.992
Yeah, we all love Maddie.

05:50.134 --> 05:51.774
Guys...

05:53.050 --> 05:54.991
I have a confession to make.

05:54.993 --> 05:56.767
It's been driving me crazy.

05:56.769 --> 06:00.085
I broke the code in the worst way.

06:00.087 --> 06:02.766
I slept with her. I slept with Maddie.

06:04.041 --> 06:06.385
- Man.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

06:06.387 --> 06:07.960
- God damn it!
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!!

06:07.962 --> 06:09.435
You don't seem mad.

06:09.437 --> 06:11.781
- I'm $100 not mad.
- You made a bet?

06:11.783 --> 06:13.020
At Langmore Cabin, dude.

06:13.022 --> 06:15.199
I said you guys would be humping it out
within a week's time.

06:15.201 --> 06:17.277
Just under the wire, Ez.

06:17.279 --> 06:19.824
My God,
I've totally been freaking out.

06:19.826 --> 06:21.097
Nah, I'm totally over her.

06:21.099 --> 06:22.437
Yeah, totally. Me too.

06:22.439 --> 06:25.017
Yeah, you're both terrible liars.

06:25.019 --> 06:26.392
- Mostly kind of...
- 99% over her.

06:26.394 --> 06:28.436
- Sort of over Cece.
- Right.

06:28.438 --> 06:30.078
I mean, one of us
was bound to sleep with her

06:30.080 --> 06:31.519
at some point.

06:31.521 --> 06:33.496
Thanks, I appreciate your understanding.

06:37.989 --> 06:40.165
So?

06:40.167 --> 06:41.506
- What?
- Well, Jesus, dude.

06:41.508 --> 06:43.483
- How was the sex?
- What?

06:43.485 --> 06:46.432
It's the least you can do. How was it?

06:46.434 --> 06:48.141
You're shitting me.
I'm... no, I'm not...

06:48.143 --> 06:49.682
Must have been weird.

06:49.684 --> 06:51.459
That's a lot of people in bed together.

06:51.461 --> 06:52.665
- What do you mean?
- Yeah.

06:52.667 --> 06:54.643
Old cutie-pie, shoe salesman Ezra,

06:54.645 --> 06:57.491
hardened con artist Ezra,
Ava, Saffron, Maddie.

06:57.493 --> 06:59.670
That's a lot of people having sex.

06:59.672 --> 07:02.418
Yeah, it's kind of hot.

07:02.420 --> 07:04.060
- Or possibly...
- Not hot at all.

07:04.062 --> 07:06.036
Like, totally confusing.

07:06.038 --> 07:07.477
So many boobs.

07:07.479 --> 07:08.651
Yeah.

07:08.653 --> 07:11.231
That's what I thought. Not fun.

07:13.579 --> 07:15.688
- Does Sofia know?
- Yeah, man.

07:15.690 --> 07:18.201
That's who you should
be having sex with.

07:18.203 --> 07:20.179
It's, complicated.

07:20.181 --> 07:22.122
Come on. Get it together, Ez.
Always forward.

07:23.465 --> 07:26.512
Yeah, Maddie's clearly moving on
in her own demented way.

07:26.514 --> 07:27.652
- Maddie what now?
- Nothing.

07:27.654 --> 07:29.327
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

07:29.329 --> 07:31.338
That's very convincing.

07:31.340 --> 07:33.349
Let's get going. It's showtime.

07:37.741 --> 07:38.879
All right, everybody.

07:38.881 --> 07:40.386
So we have the food platters,

07:40.388 --> 07:41.895
we have the drink platters,

07:41.897 --> 07:44.508
we have the doors to go in
and the doors to go out,

07:44.510 --> 07:47.625
and that is the number one
thing to remember, ladies.

07:47.627 --> 07:51.948
Do not go in the out-door
and do not go out the in-door,

07:51.950 --> 07:54.025
but let's keep all the
full trays going out

07:54.027 --> 07:55.534
and the empty trays coming in,

07:55.536 --> 07:57.578
and remember, a stationary Marilyn

07:57.580 --> 08:01.499
is a not-doing-her-job Marilyn, right?

08:09.376 --> 08:11.552
All right, my beauties. Chop, chop.

08:29.218 --> 08:30.925
Okay, there he is.

08:32.736 --> 08:34.745
Excuse me.

08:34.746 --> 08:37.192
Is that bald guy
over there Jeffery Hull?

08:37.193 --> 08:39.772
- That's him.
- You were right.

08:39.774 --> 08:41.982
I heard he's winning the Egan.

08:41.985 --> 08:44.430
No, I happen to know
Sheila Berman has it locked up.

08:44.432 --> 08:46.240
That's not what Harry Price said.

08:46.242 --> 08:49.424
See, not only that, a woman
I know on the national board

08:49.426 --> 08:51.535
tells me they're eyeing
Hull to step in for Kenner.

08:51.537 --> 08:53.780
- You're kidding me. Dina?
- Yeah?

08:53.782 --> 08:57.164
These guys are saying that
Hull is getting the Egan Award,

08:57.166 --> 08:59.544
and he's replacing Kenner.

08:59.546 --> 09:03.197
He's replacing Kenner? Is that true?

09:03.199 --> 09:05.610
Carolyn, Hull's gonna win the Egan.

09:05.612 --> 09:07.185
He's replacing Kenner.

09:07.187 --> 09:08.425
I hear Hull is...

09:08.427 --> 09:09.865
I think we should go say hello.

09:09.867 --> 09:11.407
It seems they've done a very good job

09:11.409 --> 09:13.452
- of keeping this award a secret.
- Yes.

09:13.454 --> 09:16.300
Jeffery. Hello there.

09:16.302 --> 09:18.512
Harry, yes. Good to see you.

09:18.514 --> 09:19.919
My God.

09:19.921 --> 09:22.433
Is that your scalpel hand?
What happened?

09:23.641 --> 09:25.617
I was attacked.

09:25.619 --> 09:26.890
No. How awful.

09:26.892 --> 09:28.532
Yeah, well, stuff happens, Jeffery,

09:28.534 --> 09:31.314
sooner or later to all of us.

09:31.316 --> 09:33.056
Hey, um,

09:33.058 --> 09:35.402
have you picked out a spot
to display your Egan?

09:36.143 --> 09:38.050
Excuse us, Dr. Hull.

09:38.052 --> 09:40.965
I just wanted to introduce
myself and my colleague.

09:40.967 --> 09:43.746
I'm Sugith John. This is Dina Tham.

09:43.748 --> 09:47.432
Hi. We are such fans of your
theories on implant removal.

09:47.434 --> 09:48.841
It's interesting you
should be here right now,

09:48.843 --> 09:50.919
because Dr. Price, about six months ago,

09:50.921 --> 09:52.962
ran a very interesting seminar

09:52.964 --> 09:56.515
where most people see only
the surface of things,

09:56.517 --> 09:57.922
the bones that...

09:57.924 --> 10:00.770
- So far, so good.
- All right, player.

10:00.772 --> 10:02.111
Time to do your thing.

10:02.113 --> 10:04.021
In and out. No biggie.

10:04.023 --> 10:05.932
Excuse me. Excuse me.

10:05.934 --> 10:09.048
Hey! Hey, lady, could you please
watch where you're... whoa!

10:09.050 --> 10:11.763
Lady,
that is highly inappropriate beh...

10:11.765 --> 10:13.070
Jules, God damn it.

10:13.072 --> 10:14.880
Nice ass.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.219
I just wanted to make sure
I could get away with it.

10:16.221 --> 10:18.297
Don't want you-know-who to recognize me.

10:18.299 --> 10:23.291
Dr. Sheila Berman,
actual Egan winner, 6:00.

10:23.293 --> 10:26.273
6:00. Behind you.

10:26.275 --> 10:27.714
- Don't turn. Don't turn.
- Don't turn around.

10:27.716 --> 10:29.960
Sorry, sorry. I'm a little nervous.

10:29.962 --> 10:32.004
I'm not quite as strong as you
in the disguise department.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.814
You'll do great.

10:33.816 --> 10:34.987
Let's go.

10:40.417 --> 10:44.035
That topic led to a very serious,
lively discussion.

10:44.037 --> 10:45.978
Yes, and I can see both sides.

10:45.980 --> 10:48.257
A thing of value in this world.

10:48.259 --> 10:50.100
Absolutely.

10:50.102 --> 10:51.407
Well, look at it my way.

10:51.409 --> 10:53.854
Most people see only the surface.

10:53.856 --> 10:55.328
Do you like football?

10:55.330 --> 10:57.272
Do you mean football
or American football?

10:57.274 --> 11:00.455
I've always been interested
in what lies underneath.

11:00.457 --> 11:01.495
American football is very...

11:01.497 --> 11:03.137
To me, a body... a body...

11:03.139 --> 11:04.142
- My God. I am so sorry.
- I'm sorry.

11:04.144 --> 11:05.482
Excuse me!

11:05.484 --> 11:07.024
Like a bull in a china shop today.

11:07.026 --> 11:08.230
- I'm sorry. Are you okay?
- Two left feet.

11:08.232 --> 11:09.504
- My God.
- That's okay.

11:09.506 --> 11:11.950
- Klutz.
- What was that?

11:11.952 --> 11:13.291
- One moment.
- What was that?

11:13.293 --> 11:15.335
Here is some fresh champagne for you.

11:15.337 --> 11:17.982
- Thank you. No harm done.
- I'm so sorry.

11:17.984 --> 11:19.491
It is our job...

11:32.294 --> 11:34.068
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

11:34.070 --> 11:36.984
Hey, did I see Sofia
flirting with Harry Price?

11:36.986 --> 11:38.022
Seriously?

11:44.359 --> 11:46.032
No, how could you even know?
She's not...

11:46.034 --> 11:47.306
- Shh, shh.
- Yeah? What's that?

11:47.308 --> 11:48.512
Jeff Hull is winning the Egan.

11:48.514 --> 11:50.389
Are you shitting me?

11:50.391 --> 11:52.701
I was told... I mean,
I'm not supposed to say, but...

11:52.703 --> 11:53.739
Well, that's what I thought, but...

11:53.741 --> 11:55.416
I jammed in three hips

11:55.418 --> 11:57.527
and a spinal fusion
yesterday to be here.

11:57.529 --> 11:59.303
I need to talk to Price. Where is he?

11:59.305 --> 12:01.313
Over there. With Hull.

12:01.315 --> 12:02.822
Goddamn traitor.

12:06.577 --> 12:08.250
Dr. Berman. Sorry to bother you.

12:08.252 --> 12:09.893
There's an emergency call
for you in the lobby,

12:09.895 --> 12:12.708
something about post-op
and a spinal fusion infection.

12:12.710 --> 12:13.713
- Sepsis maybe.
- Jesus.

12:13.715 --> 12:14.719
I'm not sure, yeah.

12:15.525 --> 12:16.897
- But experience is...
- My goodness.

12:16.899 --> 12:18.773
Dr. Jeffery Hull?

12:18.775 --> 12:20.884
- Hello, Doctor...
- Doctor?

12:20.886 --> 12:23.599
Hah! I wish.
No, just a fan, you could say.

12:23.601 --> 12:26.648
Shannon Stepan of July-Yards
Clamps and Catheter.

12:26.650 --> 12:28.693
I've been pushing the
company for three years

12:28.695 --> 12:29.967
on intramedullary nails,

12:29.969 --> 12:31.675
all because of your amazing article.

12:31.677 --> 12:33.284
My. Well, that's very kind.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.596
I can't believe I'm meeting you.

12:35.598 --> 12:36.702
Sorry, everyone.

12:36.704 --> 12:37.707
Sorry, I'm fangirling.

12:37.709 --> 12:39.383
So embarrassing.

12:39.385 --> 12:42.064
I'm gonna get a drink,
but I'll be back. Bye.

12:42.066 --> 12:43.874
I don't have fans like that.

12:43.876 --> 12:46.555
- Do you have any fans?
- No.

13:02.542 --> 13:04.584
Yeah, my publishers...

13:06.496 --> 13:08.639
- Good work.
- You too.

13:08.641 --> 13:10.282
For a minute there, I thought...

13:11.825 --> 13:13.197
My God.

13:13.199 --> 13:14.906
What is she doing?

13:20.069 --> 13:23.050
- What are you doing?
- Let go.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.591
Alessandra, what are you doing?

13:24.593 --> 13:26.702
I'm so sorry. That Marilyn tripped me.

13:45.236 --> 13:47.011
Hey!

13:47.013 --> 13:50.093
God damn it. What are you doing?

13:50.095 --> 13:53.009
I have to take a dump.
Is that okay with you?

13:53.011 --> 13:55.255
Damn it.

14:00.183 --> 14:02.493
Maddie's not answering.
No word from the others.

14:02.495 --> 14:04.471
Where are they?

14:04.473 --> 14:06.582
They've got a minute. They'll be here.

14:09.332 --> 14:11.910
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

14:11.912 --> 14:15.194
I've just been dreading
this next part, you know?

14:16.871 --> 14:19.953
We've had quite the run, Max?

14:19.955 --> 14:22.467
Don't get sentimental on me, Sal.

14:22.469 --> 14:24.377
We're back in the game.

14:24.379 --> 14:25.885
Just getting started, right?

14:25.887 --> 14:28.231
Sure thing, Maxie.

14:28.233 --> 14:29.906
I stopped Berman from
getting to the Doctor.

14:29.908 --> 14:31.415
Maddie showed up, almost out of nowhere.

14:31.417 --> 14:32.420
We thought that we had her
cornered, then she did

14:32.422 --> 14:33.492
a disappearing act...

14:33.494 --> 14:36.508
Dressed as Marilyn Monroe.
She's making a play for the Doctor.

14:36.510 --> 14:38.117
What do you mean,
Maddie's making a play?

14:38.119 --> 14:39.960
- She's trying to kill him.
- Bullshit.

14:39.962 --> 14:44.014
She has a bunch of drugs
and syringes, so yeah.

14:44.016 --> 14:46.360
In other news, we got both
the Doctor's basement keys.

14:46.362 --> 14:47.500
Wow, that's something.

14:47.502 --> 14:49.008
And his fingerprints.

14:49.010 --> 14:51.354
Ooh, that's another something.

14:51.356 --> 14:53.230
So what do we do about Maddie?

14:53.232 --> 14:55.040
We be better than her.

14:55.042 --> 14:57.084
All right. Phase two.

15:10.223 --> 15:12.131
All right.

15:12.133 --> 15:15.180
Breathe like you're in Burlington
and talk as little as possible.

15:17.663 --> 15:19.839
Hail, hail. The gang's all here.

15:19.841 --> 15:21.179
Hello, Doctor.

15:21.181 --> 15:23.391
How goes all things Vermont?

15:30.465 --> 15:31.803
And there it is.

15:31.805 --> 15:33.780
That's that, then.

15:33.782 --> 15:36.260
So let's talk about what happens next.

15:36.262 --> 15:39.678
What happens next is,
we never see you or hear from you again.

15:39.680 --> 15:40.951
As promised.

15:40.953 --> 15:42.795
I don't recall promising anything.

15:42.797 --> 15:46.012
I remember saying if you did this job,

15:46.014 --> 15:48.023
your families would be safe.

15:48.025 --> 15:51.340
- No.
- And now they are.

15:51.342 --> 15:52.849
As long as you keep working for me.

15:52.851 --> 15:54.356
Absolutely not.

15:54.358 --> 15:55.931
- How dare you?
- Shut your mouth.

15:55.933 --> 15:57.774
You disrupted my operation,

15:57.776 --> 15:59.886
stole what is mine.

15:59.888 --> 16:03.438
Simply put, kids, I f... own you.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.448
Welcome to the real game, kids.

16:05.450 --> 16:06.822
I'm afraid that's how it goes.

16:06.824 --> 16:10.107
Just do your job and stay loyal.

16:10.109 --> 16:11.816
For instance,

16:11.818 --> 16:15.000
don't try to take money from me.

16:15.002 --> 16:17.983
That is a no-no. Right, Max?

16:17.985 --> 16:19.826
Well, that money was for you, Doctor.

16:19.828 --> 16:21.669
To make up for the
Heller losses and the...

16:21.671 --> 16:24.718
Shh. Max, we've been through this.

16:24.720 --> 16:27.064
- And Sally?
- Yes, Doctor?

16:27.066 --> 16:28.874
We've had troubles in the past,

16:28.876 --> 16:31.555
but lately things are going
well with us, yes?

16:31.557 --> 16:33.063
- Yes.
- Good.

16:33.065 --> 16:35.241
My biggest worry at the moment

16:35.243 --> 16:37.956
is really what the FBI knows,

16:37.958 --> 16:39.765
how close they've gotten,

16:39.767 --> 16:41.466
and if Maddie is working with them.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.714
It's unlikely.

16:42.716 --> 16:44.658
I really think you're
safe on that front.

16:44.660 --> 16:47.708
I'm not convinced.

16:47.710 --> 16:50.724
I think it would be best, safest,

16:50.726 --> 16:52.466
if I disappeared.

16:55.853 --> 16:57.862
All right. How can we help?

16:59.070 --> 17:00.710
At Maddie's wedding,

17:00.712 --> 17:03.257
you looked so much like me, Max.

17:03.259 --> 17:06.843
Quite remarkable. That could be useful.

17:06.845 --> 17:08.786
In fact,

17:08.788 --> 17:11.936
you could pretend to be me again.

17:11.939 --> 17:13.780
Sure. Sure, what's the play?

17:13.781 --> 17:15.858
The play is simple.

17:15.859 --> 17:17.299
The Doctor needs to die.

17:17.300 --> 17:19.142
- What?
- Sally.

17:23.434 --> 17:24.872
My God! My God!

17:24.874 --> 17:25.844
My God!

17:25.846 --> 17:27.218
Sit down!

17:38.425 --> 17:40.243
Sally, finish it.

17:43.194 --> 17:44.934
Well done.

17:54.360 --> 17:56.034
Jesus Christ, she just killed him.

17:56.036 --> 17:57.441
She just shot him.

17:57.443 --> 17:59.284
She just freaking killed
him in cold blood!

17:59.286 --> 18:01.396
Just... just breathe. Just breathe.

18:03.643 --> 18:05.517
He was like the uncle I never had.

18:05.519 --> 18:06.791
I know, honey, I know.

18:06.793 --> 18:08.266
Jesus.

18:08.268 --> 18:09.305
Sorry, Maxie.

18:09.307 --> 18:10.847
He was strong and kind...

18:12.725 --> 18:15.169
And smart and sexy.

18:15.171 --> 18:17.348
- Did you say sexy?
- What the...

18:17.350 --> 18:18.889
Whoa!

18:19.172 --> 18:20.662
Sorry, kids. It had to be done.

18:20.697 --> 18:22.508
- Why would you do that to us?
- We're either in on this or not!

18:22.510 --> 18:23.916
We're supposed to be a team!

18:23.918 --> 18:25.357
All right, easy now.

18:25.359 --> 18:26.932
The simpler the better,

18:26.934 --> 18:28.574
and reactions like those...

18:28.576 --> 18:30.485
- Jesus.
- They can't be bought.

18:30.487 --> 18:33.233
We have him where we want him,
feeling cocky

18:33.235 --> 18:34.908
and thinking he's in the clear.

18:34.910 --> 18:38.528
- And I love you too, kid.
- Screw you.

18:38.530 --> 18:40.471
Who's ready for phase three?

18:51.632 --> 18:55.015
- You good?
- Man, I invented this move.

18:55.017 --> 18:56.925
Okay, then tell me who you work for.

18:56.927 --> 19:01.115
Dude, I work for the Federal Burr...

19:01.773 --> 19:02.924
Screw off, man.

19:08.489 --> 19:10.800
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

19:10.802 --> 19:14.452
We have a search warrant
for the house of Dr. Jeffery Hull.

19:14.455 --> 19:16.027
- Screw you.
- Hey.

19:23.938 --> 19:28.033
Okay, so I watch a little online porn.

19:28.069 --> 19:29.599
It's the 21st century.

19:29.601 --> 19:32.180
Sir, we're not here about the, porn.

19:37.242 --> 19:40.760
Well, how can I help you boys?
My son's a good man.

19:40.762 --> 19:44.311
He took me in when I had
nowhere else to go,

19:44.313 --> 19:47.126
and he really didn't have to.

19:47.128 --> 19:49.171
I wasn't a great father.

19:49.173 --> 19:51.182
Just because you were a crap father

19:51.184 --> 19:54.667
doesn't mean your son
had to become a criminal.

19:54.669 --> 19:57.046
He could have figured it out.

19:57.048 --> 20:00.900
Yeah, don't bother. He keeps it locked.

20:05.124 --> 20:07.233
Guess he left it open today.

20:42.089 --> 20:45.437
Yeah, nice prints. Very clean.

20:45.439 --> 20:47.515
That is so cool.

20:47.517 --> 20:48.621
Yeah. Don't mess with the wig.

20:48.623 --> 20:50.130
You'll rip the lace there.

20:50.132 --> 20:51.302
It's so itchy.

21:12.785 --> 21:14.693
Presto.

21:53.871 --> 21:56.013
When he was a kid,
he never had any friends.

21:56.015 --> 21:58.494
Didn't have a feel for it.

21:58.496 --> 22:01.007
Spent all his time in his room
practicing magic tricks,

22:01.009 --> 22:04.023
but that only made
people dislike him more.

22:09.990 --> 22:13.071
- Any luck?
- Nothing.

22:13.073 --> 22:15.418
Sorry for the inconvenience, sir.

22:15.420 --> 22:17.897
Let your son know the FBI came to visit.

22:20.011 --> 22:22.052
Hey, let me tell you something.

22:22.054 --> 22:24.968
The man your son is? That's not on you.

22:24.970 --> 22:26.878
He made his own choices.

22:29.227 --> 22:31.034
- Have a nice day.
- Yeah, you too.

22:32.544 --> 22:34.151
- What was that about?
- Nothing.

22:34.153 --> 22:35.726
How'd it go down there?

22:40.894 --> 22:42.763
God.

23:08.033 --> 23:11.282
I feel like I know you. Do I know you?

23:11.284 --> 23:14.800
I feel like
I'd remember if we'd met.

23:14.802 --> 23:17.013
Why is that? Do tell.

23:17.015 --> 23:21.034
Well, you have a certain flair.

23:21.036 --> 23:23.447
Indeed.

23:23.449 --> 23:27.066
Did you ever frequent
the Ujiki Club in Tokyo?

23:27.068 --> 23:29.379
- No.
- Anton's in Milan?

23:29.381 --> 23:30.820
Sorry.

23:32.564 --> 23:34.506
The Sporleder Club. Berlin.

23:34.508 --> 23:37.455
3:00 in the morning.
Untz, untz, untz, untz?

23:37.457 --> 23:39.064
Must have been my doppelganger.

23:39.066 --> 23:40.111
Doppel...

23:40.406 --> 23:41.845
Do you remember why she was there?

23:41.847 --> 23:44.291
I'm looking to make some life changes.

23:45.600 --> 23:49.017
You're an odd little bird.

23:49.019 --> 23:53.272
What brings you to this strange hotel
in this strange little city?

23:53.274 --> 23:56.155
Orthopedic convention. Hot stuff.

23:56.157 --> 23:58.434
Hot stuff.

23:58.436 --> 24:00.525
I happen to have a friend
speaking at the convention.

24:01.686 --> 24:03.661
See you soon, macaroon.

24:19.112 --> 24:21.289
Good to see you, Mr. Cohen.
Please come in.

24:55.774 --> 24:58.018
Here and now.

25:02.879 --> 25:04.552
Fancy a little girl talk?

25:08.271 --> 25:10.294
What do you want, Maddie?

25:10.296 --> 25:13.143
Come on, do you really
have to use that tone?

25:13.486 --> 25:15.495
It's so cold.

25:15.497 --> 25:17.506
- We're on the same team.
- Really?

25:17.508 --> 25:19.584
Then why'd you take a
powder and disappear?

25:19.586 --> 25:21.828
Talk about cold.

25:21.830 --> 25:23.839
But you were always
prone to going it alone.

25:23.841 --> 25:25.616
I don't really see it that way.

25:25.618 --> 25:29.201
We both have the same interests,
the same goal.

25:29.203 --> 25:31.748
- To bring him down.
- Except you want to kill him.

25:31.750 --> 25:32.988
And you what, want to see him live?

25:32.990 --> 25:34.831
After everything he's done to you?

25:34.833 --> 25:37.579
Death would be too easy
and too forgiving,

25:37.581 --> 25:39.120
and dead or alive...

25:40.965 --> 25:42.338
I will never forgive him.

25:42.340 --> 25:45.019
And he won't ever forgive you.

25:46.362 --> 25:49.577
He conned all of us.

25:49.579 --> 25:51.889
Took everything, our family,

25:51.891 --> 25:54.872
any sense of self-respect.

25:54.874 --> 25:57.419
He took me in the prime of my youth

25:57.421 --> 25:59.127
and turned me into what?

26:00.972 --> 26:03.081
You were like a mother to me.

26:04.893 --> 26:06.734
Watching it all go down.

26:06.736 --> 26:09.281
There were plenty of times
I stuck my neck out for you, kid.

26:09.283 --> 26:11.124
Don't bother. I get it.

26:11.126 --> 26:13.303
I get it. I get it all.

26:13.305 --> 26:15.113
- Something to drink, ladies?
- No, thank you.

26:15.115 --> 26:16.587
I won't be staying long.

26:22.185 --> 26:25.233
I need your help, Sal.

26:25.235 --> 26:26.339
Let's finish this.

26:26.341 --> 26:28.585
I should shoot you right now.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.093
Go for it.

26:34.485 --> 26:36.057
All right.

26:36.059 --> 26:37.331
I still have that phone you gave me.

26:37.333 --> 26:39.342
I'm gonna keep it on just in case.

26:39.344 --> 26:41.587
If you change your mind, give me a call.

26:41.589 --> 26:44.637
Otherwise...

26:44.639 --> 26:46.446
I'll see you in the game.

27:01.629 --> 27:04.576
Hello there, it's time for me
to take you to the Green Room.

27:04.578 --> 27:07.258
Of course. Come in.
I'll be right with you.

27:07.260 --> 27:09.201
Make yourself comfortable.

27:16.509 --> 27:19.120
It's a very exciting night for you.

27:19.122 --> 27:20.662
Yes, it certainly is.

27:26.428 --> 27:28.404
Hello.

27:28.506 --> 27:30.179
Hello.

27:30.181 --> 27:31.386
And who might you be?

27:31.388 --> 27:33.699
- Alessandra.
- Shelly Cohen.

27:33.701 --> 27:37.351
- Nice to meet you.
- Is it?

27:37.353 --> 27:39.395
You seem a little tense.

27:39.397 --> 27:40.736
No, no.

27:40.738 --> 27:43.484
- I was just...
- You were just...

27:43.486 --> 27:44.993
Shall we?

27:44.995 --> 27:48.276
Alessandra from the conference,
Shelly Cohen.

27:48.278 --> 27:50.521
- A man of many talents.
- That's me.

27:58.064 --> 27:59.703
The Green Room is just this way.

27:59.705 --> 28:01.513
They will let us know
when they are ready

28:01.515 --> 28:04.529
to take you backstage
for the award presentation.

28:13.346 --> 28:16.929
A tad chiffon for my taste,
but it'll do.

28:16.931 --> 28:18.437
I'm gonna go to the ballroom
and make sure everything

28:18.439 --> 28:20.481
feels just right.

28:28.459 --> 28:29.898
How are you this evening?

28:53.057 --> 28:54.731
Hello, Dad.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.306
Um, I'm afraid now is not
a good time to talk...

28:56.308 --> 28:58.149
The FBI was here. I've been...

28:58.151 --> 28:59.656
When?

28:59.658 --> 29:00.864
All morning.

29:00.866 --> 29:02.774
What were they looking for?

29:02.776 --> 29:06.393
Did they leave a... Okay, okay.

29:06.395 --> 29:09.208
Don't do anything, you hear me?
I'll take care of it.

29:23.385 --> 29:24.489
Hello?

29:24.491 --> 29:26.299
- Sally?
- Yes, Doctor.

29:26.301 --> 29:29.215
I've decided to take that
vacation we discussed.

29:29.217 --> 29:31.426
I want you to call the bank right away.

29:31.428 --> 29:34.174
- Yes, that's right.
- Same password?

29:34.176 --> 29:36.051
Periwinkle. They'll know what to do.

29:36.053 --> 29:37.223
Of course. Right away.

29:44.163 --> 29:45.937
I'd like a cup of tea.

29:45.939 --> 29:49.087
I thought we arranged to have
some goddamn tea ready.

29:49.089 --> 29:51.433
I did. I don't know what happened.

29:51.435 --> 29:53.477
Sorry. Right away.

29:55.289 --> 29:57.700
The consequences
of our deeds are amplified,

29:57.702 --> 29:59.476
for better or for worse,

29:59.478 --> 30:02.324
when acknowledged
in front of our colleagues

30:02.326 --> 30:04.503
and our friends with such ceremony,

30:04.505 --> 30:08.223
which is why it gives me
such great pleasure

30:08.225 --> 30:13.383
to announce the winner
of this year's Egan Award,

30:13.385 --> 30:14.992
Dr. Sheila Berman.

30:16.804 --> 30:18.611
Congratulations, Sheila.

30:45.624 --> 30:47.029
Did you win an award too?

30:55.477 --> 30:56.949
Shit.

30:59.800 --> 31:02.311
Well, the gang's all here.

31:02.313 --> 31:05.025
The Doctor has the ring,
and he's in the Green Room.

31:05.027 --> 31:06.835
Let's end this thing.

31:08.775 --> 31:10.287
Come in.

31:10.289 --> 31:12.431
I have tea for you, sir.

31:12.433 --> 31:13.940
Where's the girl?

31:13.942 --> 31:16.922
She checking on the time
for your speaking.

31:22.722 --> 31:25.970
I make special plate for you.
Here you go.

31:30.630 --> 31:32.170
There you go.

31:47.253 --> 31:50.635
You once told me time has a way
of answering all questions.

31:53.821 --> 31:55.830
You're about out of time.

31:58.211 --> 32:00.119
Do you have any answers?

32:11.683 --> 32:13.390
I didn't think so.

32:30.078 --> 32:32.154
In a moment, I'm going to
take the tape off your mouth,

32:32.178 --> 32:33.751
and then I'm going to leave.

32:33.753 --> 32:35.930
I want you to count to 100,

32:35.932 --> 32:38.041
then you can scream
for help all you want.

32:40.791 --> 32:43.872
I told you it was this way.
You guys never listen to me.

32:49.940 --> 32:52.049
Start counting.

32:54.698 --> 32:56.238
Dr. Hull?

33:00.798 --> 33:02.504
Jesus Christ.

33:15.543 --> 33:17.584
I wonder why Maddie didn't take this.

33:17.586 --> 33:19.898
Yeah, I don't think she cared
about the ring anymore.

33:19.900 --> 33:21.908
Hello? Is anybody there?

33:21.910 --> 33:23.081
That's Sofia.

34:08.190 --> 34:10.098
That looked like it hurt.

34:10.100 --> 34:12.141
No, no, no. I'll help you.

34:14.524 --> 34:15.996
Come on.

34:22.565 --> 34:25.313
I don't know why the hell
I'm doing this, but go!

34:26.991 --> 34:28.664
- Jules...
- Maddie, go! Run!

34:28.666 --> 34:31.178
Run!

34:31.179 --> 34:32.451
And you're welcome!

34:34.161 --> 34:36.674
I know where I know you from.

34:36.676 --> 34:38.382
You remind me of my ex-wife.

34:38.385 --> 34:40.058
Likewise.

34:53.632 --> 34:55.340
How can I help you, sir?

34:55.342 --> 34:58.121
Yes, I'd like to open
my safety deposit box.

34:58.123 --> 35:01.539
Time to cash that treasury bond
and go on that Alaska cruise

35:01.541 --> 35:03.282
I keep talking about.

35:03.284 --> 35:05.461
Of course, Dr. Hull.

35:06.702 --> 35:09.482
And your password, if you don't mind?

35:09.484 --> 35:11.727
- Periwinkle.
- Excellent.

35:11.729 --> 35:13.235
We got the call a few minutes ago.

35:13.237 --> 35:15.346
It should be ready.

35:15.348 --> 35:17.424
Right this way.

35:17.426 --> 35:19.837
Here we are, sir.
Everything should be all set for you.

35:36.025 --> 35:38.805
You got to love the modern world.

35:38.807 --> 35:41.754
We don't background-check
each and every woman

35:41.756 --> 35:44.033
who wants to be Marilyn Monroe, okay?

35:44.035 --> 35:46.713
I just need to see a list
of the OSA Marilyns.

35:49.028 --> 35:51.036
Thank you.

35:55.395 --> 35:57.807
Megan Jones.

35:57.809 --> 36:00.755
Please make sure that all
overhead bins are closed,

36:00.757 --> 36:03.872
and remember that in consideration
of your fellow passengers,

36:03.874 --> 36:06.955
cell phone use is prohibited.

36:06.957 --> 36:09.133
Rochester will be our first stop.

36:41.810 --> 36:43.919
A little side trip to Niagara Falls?

36:43.921 --> 36:46.064
Yeah, yeah.

36:46.066 --> 36:47.873
For work, though.

36:47.875 --> 36:49.918
Not for fun.

36:49.920 --> 36:52.967
- How'd it go?
- Good, good.

36:52.969 --> 36:55.213
Although I thought I had
this one guy cornered,

36:55.215 --> 36:57.056
and then boom,

36:57.058 --> 37:00.273
he has a massive coronary and dies
before I can put cuffs on him.

37:00.275 --> 37:02.183
Shame.

37:02.185 --> 37:04.126
You know, I never saw you as a murderer.

37:04.128 --> 37:05.836
- No?
- No.

37:08.284 --> 37:11.298
Not even gonna deny it?

37:11.300 --> 37:13.979
You still think you
have me all figured out.

37:13.981 --> 37:17.431
Well, maybe I do.

37:17.433 --> 37:20.413
I mean, at one point you told me
I would never catch you,

37:20.415 --> 37:23.095
and yet here we are.

37:23.097 --> 37:27.116
Yes, here we are,
except I didn't kill the Doctor.

37:27.118 --> 37:28.390
I didn't steal the ring,

37:28.392 --> 37:31.238
and I'm sure as hell
not going to prison.

37:31.240 --> 37:32.511
You finished?

37:34.087 --> 37:35.092
For now.

37:35.094 --> 37:36.667
Good.

37:38.210 --> 37:40.487
Because there's something
that I've always wanted

37:40.489 --> 37:41.995
to say to you.

37:41.997 --> 37:43.370
What's that?

37:50.040 --> 37:51.647
You have the right to remain silent.

37:53.526 --> 37:56.640
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

37:56.642 --> 37:58.315
in a court of law.

37:58.317 --> 38:00.326
You have the right to an attorney.

38:00.328 --> 38:03.107
If you can't afford one,
the court will appoint one for you.

38:06.660 --> 38:09.607
That's not bad for a
dishonest day's work?

38:15.105 --> 38:17.449
This is a lot of money.

38:17.451 --> 38:19.929
- A lot a lot.
- A super-duper lot.

38:19.931 --> 38:23.582
The drives are wiped.
The Doctor is no longer.

38:23.584 --> 38:24.990
How many burner phones did you take

38:24.992 --> 38:26.397
- from the basement?
- About 20.

38:26.399 --> 38:28.240
Yeah, make sure
they all go away for good.

38:28.242 --> 38:29.648
I don't want any
of the crews to get burned.

38:29.650 --> 38:31.223
What about Sally's cut?

38:31.225 --> 38:34.239
When I find her, I'll give it to her.

38:34.241 --> 38:36.049
Should we trust you?

38:36.051 --> 38:38.160
You want to try to take it from me?

38:42.720 --> 38:44.158
Nah.

38:44.160 --> 38:46.740
I respect my elders.

38:46.742 --> 38:47.746
Be good.

38:48.564 --> 38:49.521
I'll try,

38:49.523 --> 38:51.632
but that sounds awfully boring.

38:55.219 --> 38:57.799
No crying.

38:57.801 --> 38:59.541
No crying that we're splitting up

38:59.543 --> 39:02.858
or that our ex-wife is
quite possibly a murderer?

39:02.860 --> 39:04.433
Either.

39:04.435 --> 39:06.847
I'd bet good money
that it was Sally, not Maddie.

39:06.849 --> 39:08.254
Yeah, well, you just got rich.

39:08.256 --> 39:09.863
Don't be stupid with your money.

39:09.865 --> 39:12.577
Do you think it was Maddie?

39:12.579 --> 39:13.917
No comment.

39:16.735 --> 39:18.643
Can I tell you something ridiculous?

39:19.918 --> 39:21.927
Even after Seattle,

39:21.929 --> 39:25.479
even when I thought I was over her,

39:25.481 --> 39:27.489
Maddie still defined me, you know?

39:27.491 --> 39:31.310
Like, I had no idea
who I could be without her,

39:31.312 --> 39:32.684
and that turned out to be...

39:32.686 --> 39:34.895
An enormous, life-shattering lie?

39:36.607 --> 39:38.280
Right,

39:38.282 --> 39:40.694
and now it's like,

39:40.696 --> 39:43.810
I don't know who I'm gonna be without...

39:43.812 --> 39:45.084
you guys.

39:47.565 --> 39:49.709
Yeah, ridiculous.

39:52.090 --> 39:55.942
Okay, no matter what,
six months from today,

39:55.944 --> 39:58.857
we meet in Brooklyn at the coffee shop
below my old apartment.

39:58.859 --> 40:01.773
- Yeah, I like that.
- I'm in.

40:13.738 --> 40:15.881
I love you stupid idiots.

40:15.883 --> 40:18.562
We love you too, dummy.

40:19.109 --> 40:20.941
I thought we weren't gonna cry.

40:58.778 --> 41:00.888
Excuse me.

41:00.890 --> 41:03.401
Are you Mr. Baby Dog Eyes?

41:03.403 --> 41:06.350
Yeah, I am. I think.

41:06.352 --> 41:07.992
This is for you.

41:32.995 --> 41:37.047
Did you know the first person
to go over the Niagara Falls in a barrel

41:37.049 --> 41:39.359
was a 63-year-old lady?

41:39.361 --> 41:41.571
I did, actually,

41:41.573 --> 41:44.353
and she made it too.

41:44.355 --> 41:46.732
I, I got your note.

41:50.789 --> 41:52.363
Is that what you wanted?

41:52.365 --> 41:55.580
Yeah, and something else too.

41:55.582 --> 41:57.724
And what would that be?

41:59.771 --> 42:03.154
Come here. I'll tell you all about it.

42:21.353 --> 42:22.758
- Hello?
- Hello, Doctor?

42:22.760 --> 42:24.299
It's Ernie.

42:24.301 --> 42:25.741
I have an update on Cincinnati.

42:27.954 --> 42:29.930
Hello?

42:29.932 --> 42:31.672
Hello, Doctor?

42:34.891 --> 42:37.336
Go ahead, Ernie.

42:37.338 --> 42:38.508
I'm listening.
