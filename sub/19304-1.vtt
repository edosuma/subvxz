WEBVTT

01:46.375 --> 01:50.750
Child upon these maps do heed
This black stain to be effaced

01:51.250 --> 01:56.792
Omitting it you would proceed
Yet better it in red to trace

01:56.667 --> 01:59.750
Later, whatever may come to pass

01:59.750 --> 02:01.833
Promise there to go you must

02:01.875 --> 02:06.375
To fetch the children of Alsace
Reaching out their arms to us

02:06.958 --> 02:11.917
May in our fondest France
Hope's green saplings branch

02:11.792 --> 02:14.833
And in you, dear child, flower
Grow, grow,

02:14.792 --> 02:18.792
France awaits its hour

02:18.750 --> 02:23.375
To rid the map of every trace
of Germany, and of the Hun

02:23.292 --> 02:25.500
We must exterminate that race

02:25.500 --> 02:27.667
We must not leave a single one

02:27.667 --> 02:29.792
Heed not their children's cries,

02:29.792 --> 02:32.125
Best slay all now, the women too

02:32.125 --> 02:34.375
Or else some day again they'll rise,

02:34.375 --> 02:36.958
Which if they're dead they cannot do

02:37.458 --> 02:39.833
We have a one and only enemy

02:39.833 --> 02:42.333
Who digs the grave of Germany

02:42.333 --> 02:46.000
Its heart replete with hatred,
gall and envy

02:45.958 --> 02:48.542
We have a one and only enemy

02:48.542 --> 02:51.042
The villain raises its murderous hand

02:51.042 --> 02:53.833
Its name you know, it is England

04:35.667 --> 04:36.792
This is it!

04:40.208 --> 04:42.833
War has been declared!

04:44.500 --> 04:46.125
Well, little brother?

04:46.167 --> 04:48.792
Going to spend the war
repainting statues?

04:49.250 --> 04:50.917
I've put you on the list too!

04:51.750 --> 04:56.375
In two days, we're all leaving
for basic training in Glasgow.

04:56.292 --> 04:59.833
At last, something's happening
in our lives!

05:00.458 --> 05:02.333
Well, you coming?

06:43.375 --> 06:44.958
Two more minutes, Mr. Sprink.

07:34.792 --> 07:41.292
I have been ordered to read this message
from our beloved Kaiser:

07:43.792 --> 07:47.333
This is a dark hour for Germany.

07:48.208 --> 07:51.708
Our land is besieged

07:51.667 --> 07:54.083
and we must brandish the sword.

07:55.042 --> 08:00.292
I hope that with God's help
we shall use it well,

08:01.125 --> 08:05.500
so we may re-sheathe it with dignity.

08:13.125 --> 08:14.792
Two more minutes, Lieutenant!

09:49.958 --> 09:51.167
We're going out!

09:52.625 --> 09:55.375
100 meters to the German trenches.

09:56.125 --> 10:01.500
We've been shelling
their machine-gunners,

10:03.417 --> 10:05.417
so we should be alright.

10:05.458 --> 10:08.083
We take their front line,
then the farm just behind!

10:08.083 --> 10:11.125
The 134th will relieve us tonight

10:11.792 --> 10:13.833
and we can rest up in the rear.

10:15.333 --> 10:17.958
We'll have back-up from the Scots
on our left.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.167
You'll recognize their black caps.
Don't worry about them,

10:24.042 --> 10:26.458
pay close heed to what I tell you to do.

10:27.917 --> 10:29.333
I'm like you.

10:29.958 --> 10:31.542
I too want to go home.

10:32.625 --> 10:36.875
So do what you must
and we'll all be home for Christmas.

10:45.542 --> 10:46.458
Right.

10:47.958 --> 10:49.333
Come what will.

10:52.208 --> 10:53.542
Fix bayonets!

11:04.458 --> 11:06.333
Load rifles!

11:13.500 --> 11:15.042
Forward!

11:42.792 --> 11:47.000
Up along the sap!

11:50.292 --> 11:51.500
Get down!

12:28.458 --> 12:31.083
Don't stay here little brother...

12:33.458 --> 12:35.583
So one of us survives.

12:39.500 --> 12:44.208
No, William.

12:44.125 --> 12:47.458
Come on, William...

13:55.875 --> 13:57.542
I abandoned him.

14:01.042 --> 14:03.958
Like a coward! I abandoned him.

14:05.792 --> 14:09.000
I let him die, all alone!

14:08.958 --> 14:11.125
You had no choice.

14:13.042 --> 14:17.917
And now, we must pray for him
and for all the other casualties.

14:23.833 --> 14:25.625
The reinforcements have arrived.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.375
We're leaving, Dale.

14:31.958 --> 14:34.500
You stay here with the wounded.
- Yes, Lieutenant.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.042
I'll see you back at base.

14:49.208 --> 14:51.458
I know you're in the trenches, Father.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.042
It's me.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.083
It's Andrew Duncan.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.542
I'm not far, Padre.

15:08.458 --> 15:11.417
Father, I'm eight,

15:11.417 --> 15:12.875
eight feet...

15:15.292 --> 15:16.208
Father.

15:19.542 --> 15:24.708
The others are too far away, but me...

15:25.667 --> 15:26.750
Father.

15:27.458 --> 15:29.458
You've got to come out and help.

15:33.958 --> 15:34.958
That's it.

15:36.083 --> 15:40.375
Just walk straight ahead
and you'll be on top of me.

15:44.125 --> 15:47.000
I knew I could count on you, Father.

15:48.833 --> 15:51.667
Father, what are you doing?
This is suicide!

15:56.500 --> 16:00.167
Don't run off like that! Damn you!

16:02.125 --> 16:04.292
Get back! Get back here!

16:04.292 --> 16:09.708
We're ordered to stay in the trench!
- Cease fire!

16:12.458 --> 16:14.708
That was a stretcher-bearer.
- What?

16:16.750 --> 16:18.542
You shot a stretcher-bearer.

16:18.583 --> 16:20.250
How do you know?

16:22.458 --> 16:24.208
You fired first?

16:26.125 --> 16:28.625
A Scots marauder, Sir!

16:28.625 --> 16:30.833
Think I got him.
- Good.

16:30.833 --> 16:34.292
Stay vigilant.
At the slightest move, sound the alert.

16:34.292 --> 16:35.500
Yes, Sir!

16:35.542 --> 16:36.625
Sprink!

16:37.125 --> 16:38.292
Come with me.

16:40.292 --> 16:41.917
Yes, Sir!

16:44.750 --> 16:46.208
Attention all!

16:46.250 --> 16:50.667
Deposit the enemy weapons
in the Friedrichsstrasse trench!

16:51.792 --> 16:54.208
Go help them.
- Right.

17:01.292 --> 17:03.167
Have to rebuild it.

17:40.125 --> 17:41.792
Relax, no one saw me.

17:50.750 --> 17:51.750
Get hurt?

17:54.792 --> 17:56.792
Christ! What happened?

17:56.792 --> 17:59.375
You were barely 15 mins in there.

17:59.375 --> 18:03.083
Reinforcements didn't...
- Machine gunners in the sap.

18:03.042 --> 18:05.625
Lost a third of my men in 5 mins.

18:05.625 --> 18:07.792
When you saw the Scots retreat
on your left

18:07.792 --> 18:09.458
you gave up on the farm.

18:09.500 --> 18:12.417
So, any word?

18:13.833 --> 18:16.167
I tried the Red Cross, but no go.

18:16.917 --> 18:19.625
No news from the enemy-occupied zone.

18:21.708 --> 18:24.875
The Germans appear to be
treating civilians correctly.

18:26.167 --> 18:30.167
Your wife is most likely
at her parents' with the baby.

18:35.250 --> 18:39.167
During the shelling,
a faulty canon exploded.

18:40.292 --> 18:43.292
Killed the officer
and his 5 men outright.

18:44.333 --> 18:48.167
I asked you be drafted in
to replace him.

18:49.125 --> 18:52.667
Artillery, a fine corps.
You'll move up fast.

18:52.625 --> 18:53.667
No.

18:54.583 --> 18:57.125
Keep your gunner's career,
I stay here with my men.

18:57.125 --> 19:01.792
Find another Lieutenant, no shortage.

19:03.292 --> 19:06.458
I'm Major General here,
I'll do as I see fit.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.333
You'll do as I say.

19:11.375 --> 19:14.542
I'll let you spend Christmas
in your unit.

19:14.500 --> 19:18.583
Then you go to Poitiers for training.
That's an order.

19:23.125 --> 19:26.250
If you want your visit to remain secret
you'd best leave,

19:26.208 --> 19:28.125
my orderly's coming.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.417
You rest up here for 3 days.

19:30.458 --> 19:33.292
Then, the front line
by the Delsaux farm.

19:33.292 --> 19:35.417
The sector should be quiet
for Christmas.

19:38.167 --> 19:39.292
Get some rest.

19:40.750 --> 19:42.958
See you before you leave for Poitiers.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Goodnight.

19:46.333 --> 19:47.875
Goodnight, Sir.

19:55.708 --> 19:59.292
Lieutenant,
found some blankets for tonight.

20:00.625 --> 20:02.292
What's wrong, Lieutenant?

20:06.792 --> 20:09.625
My wallet! I've lost my wallet.

20:09.625 --> 20:14.000
The wallet with the photo you showed me?

20:13.917 --> 20:14.917
Yes.

20:18.625 --> 20:20.208
What a shame...

20:21.208 --> 20:25.833
But you hardly need photos
of your wife's face.

20:27.958 --> 20:30.167
I'd a mishap too.

20:30.167 --> 20:31.583
Look at that, Sir.

20:33.208 --> 20:36.917
Two centimeters higher
and I was a goner!

20:41.750 --> 20:43.875
And it still rings!

20:45.292 --> 20:49.375
Unstoppable, just like me!
Eh, Lieutenant?

21:01.500 --> 21:05.500
It means placing one every five meters.

21:06.750 --> 21:08.333
Every five meters?

21:11.083 --> 21:13.125
How many is that in all?

21:14.792 --> 21:16.583
About 100,000.

21:18.042 --> 21:21.125
Or 20 trains for Lille via Brussels.

21:21.667 --> 21:23.208
Incredible!

21:23.958 --> 21:25.208
Christmas trees!

21:27.458 --> 21:32.833
It'll take me longer to send these trees
to the front than our canons.

21:55.583 --> 21:57.708
Show Miss Sörensen in!

22:13.000 --> 22:14.167
How is he?

22:16.958 --> 22:18.042
Well.

22:18.583 --> 22:23.833
His regiment came under surprise attack
four days ago.

22:23.750 --> 22:26.250
But they drove back the enemy.

22:28.208 --> 22:33.375
As regards your proposal...

22:35.292 --> 22:40.875
I'm afraid to say, I cannot accept it.

22:40.750 --> 22:45.458
As a Dane, I feel the gravity
of the situation escapes you.

22:45.958 --> 22:48.208
For five months now,

22:48.208 --> 22:51.083
two million of our men
have fought unrelenting.

22:51.083 --> 22:57.958
We have neither the time nor the urge
to organize recitals.

22:58.792 --> 23:02.417
It took me a while to realize
I'd approached the wrong person.

23:02.375 --> 23:06.708
So I contacted the Kronprinz,

23:06.625 --> 23:15.792
who'd be delighted to have a recital
at his HQ on Christmas Eve.

23:15.500 --> 23:19.833
I was told you were responsible
not just for canons and convoys,

23:19.792 --> 23:22.833
but also the soldiers.

23:22.792 --> 23:27.375
So if you would kindly sign here,

23:28.250 --> 23:33.125
next to the Kronprinz,
before informing your men.

23:39.708 --> 23:43.208
You'll only see him one night.
What's the point of that?

23:44.958 --> 23:47.083
It'll be much more than one night.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.750
Our minutes are longer than yours.

24:04.083 --> 24:05.417
Mother,

24:05.458 --> 24:08.875
William and I
got your package and letter.

24:09.667 --> 24:12.542
Thanks for the mittens and the mufflers.

24:13.500 --> 24:16.250
It's so cold here, they're most welcome.

24:17.083 --> 24:20.708
The thought of you at home nice and warm
keeps us going!

24:21.750 --> 24:23.833
Thanks for the cake, too.

24:24.417 --> 24:27.458
I hope we have some left
for Christmas Eve.

24:27.458 --> 24:30.500
Your two sons, who love you...

24:30.917 --> 24:32.083
Morning, Father.

24:33.792 --> 24:37.208
3 cases of whisky!
That's a lot of ammunition.

24:37.167 --> 24:38.667
I presume I'm invited?

24:38.708 --> 24:41.125
Sir, my men are completely exhausted.

24:42.125 --> 24:44.167
We're all tired, Gordon.

24:44.167 --> 24:45.750
Every single one of us.

24:46.625 --> 24:49.458
I can bring you no relief
before three days.

24:50.292 --> 24:54.500
And if the Germans do attack tonight
or tomorrow, as they may

24:55.125 --> 24:56.750
you'll just have to deal with it.

24:58.458 --> 24:59.458
Yes Sir.

25:07.375 --> 25:09.833
Our valiant stretcher-bearer.

25:09.833 --> 25:13.958
Who nearly got one of his own men killed
in no-man's -land.

25:13.917 --> 25:17.917
A stretcher-bearer is supposed
to save lives not endanger them.

25:18.917 --> 25:20.458
I gave orders,

25:20.500 --> 25:24.292
very clear orders that it was forbidden
to leave these trenches

25:24.250 --> 25:26.458
in case of a German counter attack.

25:26.458 --> 25:27.625
Yes Sir, but...

25:27.667 --> 25:29.750
But you don't give a damn!

25:31.792 --> 25:35.167
Now I suggest you
drop the St. Bernard act in future

25:35.583 --> 25:36.958
and never forget

25:37.583 --> 25:40.292
something called military discipline!

25:44.375 --> 25:45.917
Understood?

25:47.083 --> 25:48.583
Do you understand?

25:48.625 --> 25:49.833
Yes, Sir.

25:52.500 --> 25:54.583
Can you tell me what you're doing here

25:55.292 --> 25:58.208
in the front line
in the absence of combat?

25:59.167 --> 26:00.250
Visiting a friend...

26:00.292 --> 26:01.375
What?

26:03.792 --> 26:04.875
A friend?

26:05.792 --> 26:07.417
Where do you think you are?

26:08.250 --> 26:09.958
Your local parish?

26:10.958 --> 26:14.250
You will return with me immediately
to the back line.

26:17.833 --> 26:21.125
Come on, man! Make yourself useful.

26:21.667 --> 26:22.625
Sir.

26:23.792 --> 26:25.375
This way is shorter.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.167
Take a right through the cludgies,

26:40.125 --> 26:41.458
the latrines.
- This way?

26:41.500 --> 26:44.083
Yes, this way.
- Get me out of here, will you?

26:46.250 --> 26:47.042
Enough.

26:47.125 --> 26:50.833
Sorry we have to
go through the cludgies, Sir...

26:50.792 --> 26:53.875
Christ!
- Sniper, Sir!

26:55.375 --> 26:57.500
What a bloody disgusting mess!

26:57.500 --> 26:59.083
Bad place to take a fall, Sir.

26:59.125 --> 27:02.500
Get me out of here!
- Absolutely, Sir.

27:03.583 --> 27:05.917
Shut up, will you!

27:07.375 --> 27:10.208
As a priest, I'm used to silence...

27:11.375 --> 27:12.625
That's enough.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Well?
- Nothing.

27:16.042 --> 27:20.250
Just a rifle shot. It's dead calm.

27:20.167 --> 27:24.458
Be wary, they'll stop at nothing,
even on Christmas Eve.

27:28.542 --> 27:29.625
Follow me.

27:31.792 --> 27:33.708
Know who had this brilliant idea?

27:33.750 --> 27:34.667
No.

27:35.542 --> 27:37.583
For you, Lieutenant.

27:47.500 --> 27:48.500
Sprink!

27:50.625 --> 27:54.333
You'll be leaving us for one night.

27:55.500 --> 27:57.958
To go where?

27:57.958 --> 28:01.083
Home, in a way,
where you'd be better off.

28:01.792 --> 28:04.250
Why do you dislike me, Sir?

28:08.875 --> 28:14.417
After your regiment was disbanded
I had to take you.

28:14.292 --> 28:17.583
But I prefer masons, bakers, farmers.

28:18.833 --> 28:21.958
Artists like you are a dead loss,

28:21.958 --> 28:24.375
nothing but a millstone.

28:24.375 --> 28:27.250
Now go. This officer's taking you.

28:44.458 --> 28:45.875
Get a move on!

28:45.917 --> 28:48.167
It's 10 o'clock and nothing's done!

29:01.208 --> 29:02.833
Easy on there.

29:03.875 --> 29:05.250
It's not too short?

29:05.292 --> 29:11.958
I told you, Lieutenant,
I'm the best barber in Lens.

29:11.792 --> 29:14.167
Even the mayor used to come to my shop!

29:16.375 --> 29:19.750
And Henri Hennebicque,
was he a customer?

29:19.708 --> 29:23.583
Hennebicque... Doesn't ring a bell.

29:23.542 --> 29:24.833
My father-in-law,

29:25.458 --> 29:29.208
deputy mayor, lives at 21 Cypress Alley.

29:30.042 --> 29:31.625
You never told me.

29:32.417 --> 29:35.042
Cypress Alley, I know it well!

29:35.792 --> 29:38.375
Been a few times to have my bike fixed

29:38.375 --> 29:41.708
at Narcisse Denoyelle's, number 43.

29:42.292 --> 29:46.125
Right, I can see it now,
a little blue gate.

29:52.042 --> 29:55.167
I feel I can tell you, now...

29:55.125 --> 29:59.083
Sometimes, of an evening,
I head up along the embankment

29:59.042 --> 30:03.333
towards the farm, softly softly,
so not to get killed.

30:06.750 --> 30:10.833
I sit down and I look...

30:11.542 --> 30:13.792
I know the Delsaux farm well.

30:14.333 --> 30:17.750
I'd cycle there for eggs and milk.

30:19.125 --> 30:24.875
Just beyond the farm
is the road to Lens.

30:25.500 --> 30:27.042
Straight to Lens.

30:31.042 --> 30:35.125
On foot, I'd be home in an hour.

30:35.917 --> 30:37.125
No bother,

30:38.583 --> 30:39.667
one hour!

30:41.583 --> 30:45.083
My mother would be waiting at the door,

30:45.042 --> 30:48.083
a full pot of coffee on the stove,

30:48.958 --> 30:51.417
just like before...

31:00.167 --> 31:02.792
What a nuisance, these damn lice!

31:06.292 --> 31:07.458
There you go.

31:08.833 --> 31:12.000
I think I'm done, Lieutenant.

31:15.458 --> 31:16.792
Well?

31:17.875 --> 31:19.042
Ponchel,

31:20.542 --> 31:22.292
there's no mirror in front!

31:23.667 --> 31:25.958
Christ, what an idiot!

31:27.292 --> 31:32.167
But you're grand, Sir,
tip-top for the party tonight.

31:32.083 --> 31:34.167
If you say so!
- I do...

31:38.167 --> 31:40.083
Welcome, Miss.

31:40.125 --> 31:41.583
My pleasure.

31:41.625 --> 31:42.792
This way, please.

31:52.583 --> 31:54.875
Miss Sörenson, most honored.

32:00.917 --> 32:05.375
I will not tolerate mistakes!
Clean that up at once!

32:11.083 --> 32:15.042
Know where Nikolaus Sprink is?

32:17.500 --> 32:20.292
Know where Nikolaus Sprink is?

32:20.292 --> 32:22.125
He arrived about an hour ago.

32:22.167 --> 32:24.292
Sprink? The tenor?

32:24.292 --> 32:25.125
Yes.

32:25.208 --> 32:29.000
Miss, though we've owned this house
for 300 years,

32:28.958 --> 32:32.542
it is no longer our home
since September 23 last.

32:32.500 --> 32:34.833
Ask elsewhere, if you would.

32:35.417 --> 32:40.625
With any taste they'll have put him
in my room on the top floor.

32:40.542 --> 32:41.625
Thank you.

32:42.292 --> 32:45.875
You poor thing! Good taste indeed!

32:47.167 --> 32:52.750
Prussians with taste!
You shouldn't even answer those people.

33:19.583 --> 33:23.167
No! I have lice.

35:15.583 --> 35:18.583
We'll sing again together,
just like before.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.042
I am not like before, Anna.

35:29.792 --> 35:32.667
Sing for me! Sing for us!

36:09.250 --> 36:10.375
Your Highness.

36:14.125 --> 36:18.000
I'm glad to see the war has spared you.

36:19.125 --> 36:24.083
That you volunteered as a private,

36:23.958 --> 36:26.375
was most impressive.

36:27.417 --> 36:30.250
I did not volunteer.

36:30.250 --> 36:33.083
I was called up like all the others.

36:36.167 --> 36:41.333
I congratulate you
on your initiative, Miss.

36:41.250 --> 36:46.333
It takes a woman to remind us
that despite the war, it is Christmas.

36:46.792 --> 36:50.417
Thanks to you and your voices,

36:50.375 --> 36:52.917
tonight shall feel just like Berlin,

36:53.625 --> 36:56.292
where I hope to return
as soon as possible.

36:57.625 --> 36:59.542
Perhaps next spring,

37:00.458 --> 37:02.917
if all goes to plan.

37:04.167 --> 37:05.708
Next spring!

39:53.417 --> 39:54.750
You smoke?

40:01.125 --> 40:03.375
Everyone smokes in the trenches.

40:03.958 --> 40:06.625
You kill time as you can.

40:10.042 --> 40:13.917
It's five years today since we met.

40:16.375 --> 40:17.583
Oslo...

40:20.125 --> 40:22.167
Five years already?

40:24.792 --> 40:29.292
To have to brush with death
to realize how time flies.

40:29.208 --> 40:30.750
That's the terrible thing.

40:34.667 --> 40:39.542
All these fat, sated men parading,
swilling Champagne.

40:44.458 --> 40:46.625
Anna, I must return to the front...

40:48.292 --> 40:50.625
to sing for my comrades.

40:51.542 --> 40:52.875
Tonight, above all.

40:52.958 --> 40:56.667
For months I've dreamt of this
and you want to go?

40:56.625 --> 40:58.458
I don't want to leave you,

40:59.208 --> 41:02.000
but I must go sing for them.

41:02.625 --> 41:04.458
I'll return afterwards.

41:05.583 --> 41:06.542
I'll come too.

41:06.625 --> 41:08.250
Out of the question!

41:08.875 --> 41:12.542
It's too dangerous. You don't realize.

41:13.625 --> 41:14.917
When you left,

41:14.958 --> 41:20.000
not a second passed without my wondering
if you were still alive.

41:19.917 --> 41:24.125
You are and I am with you.
Nothing else matters.

41:26.417 --> 41:29.458
I've too long awaited this night.

41:30.125 --> 41:32.917
I'll not lose a single instant.

41:35.292 --> 41:40.083
And without my pass from the Kaiser
you'll not get far.

41:41.792 --> 41:44.333
You have a pass from the Kaiser?

41:48.375 --> 41:51.500
The Major General places
his trust in you.

41:57.458 --> 41:58.917
Hell, Lieutenant!

41:58.958 --> 42:01.833
Couldn't they leave us be
on Christmas Eve?

42:01.792 --> 42:04.458
The dirty work always falls to the same!

42:04.458 --> 42:06.125
I volunteer to go.

42:07.417 --> 42:09.167
I want no trouble, Gueusselin.

42:10.292 --> 42:14.833
Approach their lines,
recce the machine guns and back.

42:14.750 --> 42:15.833
Understood?

42:15.917 --> 42:19.917
With this moonlight
can I return fire if spotted?

42:20.833 --> 42:23.625
Stealth and speed
if you want a hot meal.

42:41.208 --> 42:44.583
Hey lads, where'd you get the pipes?

42:46.083 --> 42:48.375
Where'd you get the pipes?
- I found it.

42:48.417 --> 42:51.958
The guys in 92nd heard
we'd be in the trenches for Christmas.

42:51.917 --> 42:55.583
That was decent!
Don't suppose there's a spare set?

42:56.083 --> 42:58.167
Sit here, you can use mine.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.667
Padre, give us a song.

43:02.333 --> 43:03.958
I'm dreaming of home?

44:15.458 --> 44:17.208
Come boys, louder!

45:13.375 --> 45:15.625
They seem to be having fun.

45:17.125 --> 45:18.875
Wouldn't you like to as well?

45:19.625 --> 45:21.667
This is Anna Sörensen.

45:21.667 --> 45:23.625
Good evening.

45:25.208 --> 45:26.250
Good evening.

45:26.292 --> 45:27.417
What's all this?

45:28.625 --> 45:31.250
Are you mad bringing this lady here?

45:31.292 --> 45:32.917
Lieutenant,

45:32.917 --> 45:37.958
I convinced the Kronprinz
that a little music would do no harm.

45:40.958 --> 45:42.000
Very well.

45:43.083 --> 45:44.583
Fire away.

46:20.292 --> 46:21.375
Lieutenant!

46:22.250 --> 46:25.917
Come quickly, something odd is afoot.

46:32.792 --> 46:34.583
I don't like this, Lieutenant.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.750
Could be a diversion
for some dirty trick.

48:27.750 --> 48:28.792
Sprink.

48:33.208 --> 48:34.333
Get down!

51:00.083 --> 51:02.000
Good evening, Englishmen!

51:02.042 --> 51:03.333
Good evening Germans,

51:03.375 --> 51:05.708
but we're not English! We're Scottish!

51:13.250 --> 51:16.167
Very nice, but that's enough.

51:17.833 --> 51:19.708
This is not the Berlin opera.

51:20.792 --> 51:21.917
You're right.

51:23.542 --> 51:25.667
It's better than Berlin.

51:28.625 --> 51:32.708
Well I never! That beats the lot...

51:32.625 --> 51:35.583
A summit meeting
and we're not even invited!

51:35.583 --> 51:37.042
Shut it, Ponchel!

51:37.792 --> 51:39.417
What the hell's going on?

51:55.292 --> 51:56.875
Good evening.

51:56.917 --> 51:58.417
Do you speak English?

51:59.083 --> 52:00.792
Yes... a little.

52:01.375 --> 52:03.083
Wonderful.

52:03.083 --> 52:06.000
We've been talking about a ceasefire

52:07.208 --> 52:10.208
for Christmas Eve. What do you think?

52:16.625 --> 52:19.125
The outcome of this war
won't be decided tonight.

52:20.083 --> 52:24.000
No one would criticize us for
laying down our rifles on Christmas Eve.

52:24.917 --> 52:27.583
Don't worry, it is just for tonight.

52:28.292 --> 52:30.625
What the devil are they up to?

52:30.625 --> 52:32.583
Maybe the Germans are fed up.

52:33.583 --> 52:35.542
They want to surrender.

52:37.625 --> 52:38.792
I doubt it.

52:41.958 --> 52:44.542
Give me a bottle of champagne
and my beaker.

52:49.750 --> 52:50.708
Thank you.

52:54.125 --> 52:55.167
Thank you.

53:03.125 --> 53:04.375
Merry Christmas!

53:05.500 --> 53:06.708
Merry Christmas!

53:07.250 --> 53:08.417
Merry Christmas!

53:24.667 --> 53:26.458
What idiot did...

54:06.458 --> 54:07.625
Merry Christmas!

54:56.458 --> 54:58.375
Good evening, I'm Anna.

55:20.708 --> 55:22.667
You first... Go ahead.

55:37.625 --> 55:42.458
Felix! Where have you been?

55:42.375 --> 55:47.000
No, his name is not Felix, it's Nestor.

55:46.917 --> 55:49.458
It's Felix...
- No, Nestor.

55:49.417 --> 55:55.000
It's the cat from the Delsaux farm.
No, I know better than you.

55:54.875 --> 55:56.750
It's Felix...
- No, Nestor.

55:56.792 --> 55:58.792
Here, I've had enough.

55:58.792 --> 56:01.083
It's Felix...
- No, Nestor.

56:01.083 --> 56:08.708
See? It's Nestor.
- It's Felix.

56:08.500 --> 56:12.083
Nestor's heading for the French side.

56:13.833 --> 56:15.000
My wife.

56:21.292 --> 56:24.458
A pretty girl.
- Very.

56:27.375 --> 56:29.250
This is my wife.

56:47.833 --> 56:49.042
Montparnasse...

56:50.125 --> 56:52.667
That's my wife's favorite part
in Paris.

56:53.708 --> 56:55.375
The Luxemburg Gardens.

56:56.417 --> 56:58.917
Got a picture of your wife?

56:59.250 --> 57:02.958
Like you, I had a photo of her, but...

57:02.917 --> 57:04.083
I lost it.

57:06.500 --> 57:08.292
I've drawn her face, but...

57:09.500 --> 57:11.333
it's not really the same.

57:23.583 --> 57:26.250
Do you live on Rue Vavin?

57:29.000 --> 57:30.000
Yes.

57:35.250 --> 57:36.417
I think...

57:38.417 --> 57:42.458
I find your wallet in my trench,
the night of the assault.

57:43.208 --> 57:45.083
I kept it because of the address.

57:51.792 --> 57:54.042
A little hotel on Rue Vavin.

57:57.417 --> 58:01.125
Spent a week there with my wife,
two years ago.

58:01.958 --> 58:03.792
For our honeymoon.

58:07.458 --> 58:08.958
Thank you.

58:09.583 --> 58:10.667
You're welcome.

58:15.500 --> 58:18.542
Hold on, that's Gueusselin's bottle!

58:18.500 --> 58:20.333
Who cares, he's turned in.

58:20.375 --> 58:21.542
I doubt it.

58:22.000 --> 58:26.500
Thank you, very much... Sirs.

58:38.917 --> 58:40.083
It's good!

58:42.375 --> 58:45.333
How many months pregnant was she there?

58:45.292 --> 58:46.458
Five months.

58:47.833 --> 58:49.708
That was in Lens, at her parents'

58:51.375 --> 58:52.667
last July...

58:53.958 --> 58:58.875
Then there were complications,
she was confined to bed...

58:59.583 --> 59:03.667
I asked to stay by her side, but no go.

59:08.125 --> 59:11.083
Called to war, I'd to leave her there.

59:11.958 --> 59:16.917
But... Don't you write?

59:16.833 --> 59:18.125
How is she?

59:19.708 --> 59:22.417
I've had no letters since September.

59:22.417 --> 59:24.667
The front is impassable.

59:25.625 --> 59:27.833
I don't even know
if it's a boy or a girl.

01:01:02.917 --> 01:01:04.417
I abandoned you.

01:01:05.917 --> 01:01:07.625
I abandoned you here.

01:01:10.792 --> 01:01:11.958
Hey, Scotsman!

01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:15.042
Don't go for the piety either?

01:01:15.875 --> 01:01:18.500
The French gave me some champagne.

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:19.625
Like some?

01:01:23.708 --> 01:01:24.708
Come.

01:02:17.417 --> 01:02:18.875
Sing for us.

01:02:22.583 --> 01:02:23.833
Sing for them.

01:06:21.417 --> 01:06:22.958
Good evening, gentlemen.

01:07:20.792 --> 01:07:22.625
Please... Make way.

01:07:22.667 --> 01:07:24.500
Thank you, thank you.

01:07:27.375 --> 01:07:28.583
You were wonderful.

01:07:30.958 --> 01:07:34.083
I'm Jewish.
Christmas means nothing to me.

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:37.208
But I'll never forget tonight.

01:07:38.208 --> 01:07:39.250
Thank you.

01:07:43.292 --> 01:07:45.417
So what about the young lady?

01:07:45.458 --> 01:07:47.708
Yes, I wanted to ask you.

01:07:47.708 --> 01:07:51.750
Could she spend the night
in your shelter?

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:54.667
I meant: when is she leaving?

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.042
Tomorrow morning.

01:07:57.042 --> 01:07:58.042
Fine.

01:07:59.958 --> 01:08:02.583
Alas, you cannot sleep in my shelter.

01:08:02.583 --> 01:08:04.125
I have company.

01:08:05.833 --> 01:08:10.167
A big rat, for 3 days now,
but I'll get him in the end.

01:08:10.125 --> 01:08:12.417
We'll find a solution.

01:08:12.458 --> 01:08:14.500
Good night, Lieutenant.

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.375
Good night.

01:08:20.207 --> 01:08:22.707
Don't worry, Miss.

01:08:22.707 --> 01:08:25.375
I'll find you a safe place.

01:08:25.375 --> 01:08:26.582
Thanks, Jörg.

01:08:29.625 --> 01:08:31.375
So, Lieutenant,

01:08:31.875 --> 01:08:34.332
what did you put in your report for HQ?

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.457
I wrote: 24th of December, 1914:

01:08:39.167 --> 01:08:41.542
no hostilities
on the German side tonight.

01:08:43.292 --> 01:08:44.917
Well, that's the truth.

01:08:48.417 --> 01:08:49.707
Tonight,

01:08:51.207 --> 01:08:55.667
these men were drawn to that altar
like a fire in the middle of winter.

01:08:57.582 --> 01:09:01.125
Even those who aren't devout
came to warm themselves.

01:09:03.542 --> 01:09:05.292
Maybe just to be together.

01:09:08.875 --> 01:09:11.375
Maybe to forget about the war.

01:09:13.457 --> 01:09:14.542
Maybe...

01:09:17.957 --> 01:09:19.875
But the war won't forget us!

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.542
Merry Christmas.

01:10:16.667 --> 01:10:18.708
Oskar!

01:10:19.667 --> 01:10:22.250
Oskar!

01:10:34.125 --> 01:10:37.750
Listen. Someone's digging out there.

01:10:37.708 --> 01:10:40.708
Mines! Those damn Scots
are digging a mine sap!

01:10:42.542 --> 01:10:45.125
They'll fill it with explosives
and blow us sky high.

01:10:48.875 --> 01:10:51.125
No, they're not digging any sap.

01:10:51.125 --> 01:10:55.042
They are, I tell you!

01:10:54.958 --> 01:10:56.792
You just got too pally with them
last night.

01:10:56.833 --> 01:10:57.917
Yeah?

01:10:59.125 --> 01:11:01.792
Look who's talking!
- Look!

01:11:10.583 --> 01:11:12.958
Jonathan, come with me.

01:11:15.167 --> 01:11:16.292
Jonathan.

01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:19.208
Dale!

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:21.500
Dale!

01:11:22.292 --> 01:11:26.292
What the hell are you doing?
The truce is over.

01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:28.042
Any minute the Germans
will start shooting,

01:11:28.083 --> 01:11:30.167
get back in the trench!

01:11:30.208 --> 01:11:31.208
Now!

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.167
Get back down!

01:11:39.833 --> 01:11:40.833
Down!

01:11:47.625 --> 01:11:49.500
Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Good morning.

01:11:50.958 --> 01:11:54.667
Is it possible that we officers
talk about the dead?

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
The dead?

01:11:59.125 --> 01:12:00.208
Ponchel!

01:12:02.542 --> 01:12:04.000
Bring your coffee!

01:12:21.542 --> 01:12:22.583
Thank you.

01:12:28.208 --> 01:12:29.208
Thank you.

01:12:43.583 --> 01:12:46.708
Thanks, Ponchel. You can leave us now.

01:12:52.625 --> 01:12:56.417
My men will remove the bodies
of the men killed last week,

01:12:56.375 --> 01:12:58.083
so you can bury them.

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:01.917
And we will return the remains
of your men

01:13:01.958 --> 01:13:04.417
who fell in front of our lines
last November.

01:13:05.375 --> 01:13:06.625
That makes sense.

01:13:07.625 --> 01:13:10.042
Burying the dead
on the day Christ was born.

01:13:11.458 --> 01:13:12.667
That makes sense.

01:13:14.292 --> 01:13:15.292
Yes.

01:13:24.042 --> 01:13:25.375
I'm fast.

01:13:26.375 --> 01:13:30.917
Sorry, but why does an alarm
go off every morning at ten o'clock?

01:13:30.833 --> 01:13:32.250
Changing of the guard?

01:13:32.292 --> 01:13:33.333
No,

01:13:33.375 --> 01:13:38.125
my aide-de-camp used to have coffee
every morning at ten, with his mother.

01:13:38.542 --> 01:13:41.583
He's worried he'll
forget about all that with the war.

01:13:42.208 --> 01:13:43.833
We've just got used to it.

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:45.667
So have we.

01:14:48.125 --> 01:14:49.542
Need a hand?

01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:38.542
GOD IS WITH US

01:15:38.625 --> 01:15:40.333
Can you come, Father?

01:17:08.458 --> 01:17:11.375
In a few days, their families,

01:17:11.958 --> 01:17:16.042
their wives,
will receive the terrible news...

01:17:19.458 --> 01:17:21.708
What we'd rather not think about.

01:17:24.667 --> 01:17:28.125
For them,
nothing will ever be the same again.

01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:33.875
You too,

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.583
one day they'll cover you
and dump you in a hole.

01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:47.042
Let us go, while there's still time.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.292
I have my pass, Holland is not far.

01:17:49.292 --> 01:17:52.500
It is at peace, we'd have a future.

01:17:52.458 --> 01:17:55.458
Impossible! That'd be to desert.

01:17:55.458 --> 01:17:59.125
It's not desertion,
it's staying together.

01:17:59.083 --> 01:18:02.167
I'm a soldier. Like all the others.

01:18:02.125 --> 01:18:04.625
I have duties, like everyone here.

01:18:06.292 --> 01:18:08.167
Holland is quite a way.

01:18:08.208 --> 01:18:12.125
We'd get caught. Even with your pass.

01:18:13.375 --> 01:18:15.750
There's another solution.

01:18:16.833 --> 01:18:21.167
The French border is 100 m away.
We only have to cross it.

01:18:22.083 --> 01:18:25.750
I've made tea. Perhaps you'd like some.

01:18:26.625 --> 01:18:27.625
Come.

01:18:29.958 --> 01:18:31.000
Come.

01:18:49.333 --> 01:18:50.542
By the way...

01:18:52.042 --> 01:18:54.833
The others asked me
to give you these letters.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.917
We don't trust the military post

01:18:59.875 --> 01:19:03.875
and as you're going back to Berlin,
we thought...

01:19:05.292 --> 01:19:06.500
Sure.

01:19:25.583 --> 01:19:26.875
Come on, Morallec!

01:19:27.792 --> 01:19:28.750
Go for it!

01:19:44.583 --> 01:19:46.792
Looks like trouble for the Jerries.

01:19:57.083 --> 01:19:59.667
I heard last night, about your wife...

01:20:02.208 --> 01:20:03.833
If you like...

01:20:04.833 --> 01:20:07.208
I can get a letter through to her.

01:20:08.458 --> 01:20:12.167
Why would you do that?
If you got caught...

01:20:13.833 --> 01:20:18.125
One letter won't stop us
winning the war!

01:20:18.958 --> 01:20:24.375
And anyhow when we'll have taken Paris,
and it's over,

01:20:24.250 --> 01:20:27.667
you can invite us for a drink
in Rue Vavin.

01:20:28.708 --> 01:20:31.875
You don't have to invade Paris
to drop round for a drink.

01:20:35.375 --> 01:20:39.500
How many cartridges
have you to fire per day?

01:20:40.417 --> 01:20:41.333
How many?

01:20:42.458 --> 01:20:43.958
Ah, eight!

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.583
What?
- Eight.

01:20:47.917 --> 01:20:50.333
Oh, eight.

01:20:50.333 --> 01:20:51.792
And you?

01:20:51.833 --> 01:20:53.625
Seven
- Seven?

01:20:53.625 --> 01:20:55.667
Seven and eight.

01:20:55.667 --> 01:20:58.750
Us, five! Doesn't surprise me!

01:21:00.625 --> 01:21:03.625
Yesterday, William managed
to bag two Jerries

01:21:03.625 --> 01:21:06.250
who'd been sniping at us for hours.

01:21:06.250 --> 01:21:07.333
If he keeps this up,

01:21:07.417 --> 01:21:10.792
he'll qualify as the best shot
in the whole platoon.

01:21:11.958 --> 01:21:14.583
All our mates
have their eyes on your cake,

01:21:14.583 --> 01:21:17.542
but William and I
are guarding it closely.

01:21:18.542 --> 01:21:21.708
Lots of love from both of us.

01:21:33.167 --> 01:21:36.833
Still here? Weren't they sending a car?

01:21:36.792 --> 01:21:41.042
We waited, but no one came for her.

01:21:40.958 --> 01:21:44.500
I guess the party dragged on at HQ,
they're not awake yet.

01:21:53.583 --> 01:21:56.083
HQ called me 5 minutes ago.

01:21:56.708 --> 01:21:58.833
They told me you'd vanished.

01:21:59.792 --> 01:22:02.750
They thought you'd deserted, Sprink.

01:22:03.458 --> 01:22:06.750
I told them you were here
with Miss Sörensen,

01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:10.083
that you came to sing for your comrades.

01:22:10.042 --> 01:22:13.250
That really impressed them!

01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:17.667
I was asked to keep an eye on you
till they arrive.

01:22:18.833 --> 01:22:21.583
Miss Sörensen will return to Berlin

01:22:22.750 --> 01:22:25.333
and you will be put under arrest.

01:22:26.583 --> 01:22:28.333
Two weeks.

01:22:28.375 --> 01:22:31.167
For disobedience on the front.

01:22:33.125 --> 01:22:35.208
Disobedience?

01:22:36.125 --> 01:22:38.375
I'm not sure I understand?

01:22:39.125 --> 01:22:41.792
So what's the plan for tomorrow?

01:22:41.792 --> 01:22:44.000
A little football match

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.458
and an aperitif
with those across the way?

01:22:48.583 --> 01:22:53.625
Or will you shoot them like rabbits
having shared champagne?

01:22:54.708 --> 01:22:56.958
Well, Lieutenant?

01:22:57.833 --> 01:23:00.083
All that is now meaningless.

01:23:00.125 --> 01:23:02.583
To die tomorrow
is even more absurd than yesterday.

01:23:02.583 --> 01:23:04.375
That'll do, Sprink!

01:23:09.583 --> 01:23:10.875
Any coffee left?

01:23:12.417 --> 01:23:13.667
Felix!

01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:17.875
Damn that cat!

01:23:17.833 --> 01:23:21.750
Here, Nestor!

01:23:35.292 --> 01:23:37.042
Is the French Lieutenant here?

01:23:37.083 --> 01:23:39.833
Yes, he just arrived.

01:23:40.292 --> 01:23:42.167
What're you doing here?

01:23:42.208 --> 01:23:44.208
We said each to their own camp.

01:23:44.875 --> 01:23:46.542
I know, but...

01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:52.500
Our artillery will shell you
in 10 minutes.

01:23:53.250 --> 01:23:57.208
So I suggest you come shelter
in my trench.

01:24:11.708 --> 01:24:14.833
Had you been relieved,
I'd not have warned your successors.

01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:19.083
They would have shot you first anyway.

01:24:19.625 --> 01:24:21.042
Par for the course!

01:24:38.708 --> 01:24:40.208
Not a word, Sprink!

01:25:20.792 --> 01:25:22.167
Bull's-eye!

01:25:24.542 --> 01:25:25.625
Sorry.

01:25:27.208 --> 01:25:29.250
Damn! Have to rebuild it all over!

01:25:42.625 --> 01:25:43.917
By the way...

01:25:45.208 --> 01:25:48.625
That letter for my wife...

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.167
We've ceased fire.

01:26:04.875 --> 01:26:06.667
It's time for you to go back.

01:26:06.708 --> 01:26:08.708
Hope you both make it through the war.

01:26:09.458 --> 01:26:11.208
I don't think it's over yet.

01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:15.583
I wouldn't be surprised if our own
artillery opened fire after your attack.

01:26:17.208 --> 01:26:18.625
Par for the course!

01:27:00.542 --> 01:27:03.708
This time, we leave it at that.

01:27:07.833 --> 01:27:09.875
It was nice knowing you.

01:27:11.667 --> 01:27:16.667
Perhaps, in other circumstances,
we could have...

01:27:17.167 --> 01:27:18.750
Perhaps...

01:27:20.625 --> 01:27:24.250
Yet maybe a drink in Rue Vavin,
as a tourist!

01:27:25.458 --> 01:27:26.500
Yeh.

01:27:27.583 --> 01:27:31.250
That would be smashing!
Is that how you say?

01:27:31.208 --> 01:27:32.250
Right.

01:27:32.833 --> 01:27:35.375
Your French beats my German.

01:27:35.958 --> 01:27:39.542
No merit in that.
Your wife is not German.

01:27:43.958 --> 01:27:45.125
Well...

01:27:46.625 --> 01:27:47.625
Good luck.

01:27:47.667 --> 01:27:48.875
You too.

01:27:51.375 --> 01:27:56.458
Goodbye.
- Good luck.

01:28:08.417 --> 01:28:10.958
Goodbye.
- Good luck.

01:28:11.875 --> 01:28:13.208
Right boys!

01:28:49.458 --> 01:28:50.500
Lieutenant,

01:28:53.625 --> 01:28:57.167
I managed earlier
to recce their machine guns.

01:28:57.958 --> 01:28:59.375
All there.

01:29:10.125 --> 01:29:11.167
Jörg...

01:29:47.792 --> 01:29:49.875
What are you doing here?

01:29:50.708 --> 01:29:52.875
We want you to take us prisoner.

01:29:52.917 --> 01:29:56.333
Prisoner? That's not possible!

01:29:57.792 --> 01:30:00.875
How do I explain your presence
to my superiors?

01:30:01.625 --> 01:30:03.458
I can't do that!

01:30:03.458 --> 01:30:06.208
Go back to your trenches,
playtime's over.

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:09.542
Sir,

01:30:10.958 --> 01:30:13.625
if we return to the German side
they'll separate us.

01:30:16.833 --> 01:30:20.500
Put us in whatever jail you like,
but let us be together,

01:30:21.958 --> 01:30:23.292
I beg of you.

01:30:28.708 --> 01:30:31.042
Couturier.
- Yes, Sir?

01:30:31.042 --> 01:30:33.458
Take these two to the rear,
to the village.

01:30:35.208 --> 01:30:38.167
They're prisoners.
Put them in the schoolroom,

01:30:38.125 --> 01:30:39.708
I'll bunk elsewhere.

01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:42.333
And stay with them, we're back tomorrow.

01:30:42.333 --> 01:30:43.417
Lieutenant!

01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:47.542
Can you give these to the Red Cross?

01:30:47.542 --> 01:30:48.708
It's important.

01:31:02.042 --> 01:31:02.958
Ponchel!

01:31:04.667 --> 01:31:05.667
Ponchel!

01:31:06.417 --> 01:31:09.708
Where's Ponchel?
Been calling him for the past hour.

01:31:09.667 --> 01:31:12.250
Said he was going for nosh, Sir.

01:31:12.875 --> 01:31:14.000
Nosh?

01:31:34.292 --> 01:31:36.708
Dearest, I cling to your memory,

01:31:36.708 --> 01:31:40.167
like a climber to his rope,
so not to fall...

01:31:40.125 --> 01:31:42.500
The poor guy died between our lines...

01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:45.708
Let President Poincaré come take
Lorraine himself for all I care!

01:31:45.667 --> 01:31:47.167
Try as we did,

01:31:47.208 --> 01:31:50.875
before we knew it, they'd scored six!

01:31:50.833 --> 01:31:54.500
They admitted later
that most of them play together

01:31:54.458 --> 01:31:56.333
in a Munich club called Bayern...

01:31:56.375 --> 01:31:58.958
Never will I forget her voice
in the night...

01:31:58.958 --> 01:32:01.292
I stayed in my trench, in peace.

01:32:01.292 --> 01:32:03.875
Drink with those bastards?
I'd rather die!

01:32:04.708 --> 01:32:06.417
Better trenches, must admit...

01:32:06.458 --> 01:32:10.583
The Scots photographer
promised us pictures at New Year's.

01:32:10.542 --> 01:32:12.000
Be a chance to get back together...

01:32:12.042 --> 01:32:15.625
A Bavarian gave me his address,
to visit when it's over...

01:32:15.625 --> 01:32:20.542
We and the British decided
to accept the Krauts' invitation.

01:32:20.458 --> 01:32:23.167
We'll go spend New Year's Eve with them.

01:32:23.167 --> 01:32:26.458
We'll sing that song
the Scots taught us.

01:32:27.292 --> 01:32:31.250
And above all, drink to the health
of all those bastards,

01:32:31.208 --> 01:32:34.750
who sitting pretty,
sent us here to slug it out!

01:32:52.958 --> 01:32:55.083
Come on...

01:33:06.125 --> 01:33:07.542
He's all yours now.

01:33:27.333 --> 01:33:28.708
Give me some water.

01:33:41.417 --> 01:33:44.250
You're being sent back
to your parish in Scotland.

01:33:45.542 --> 01:33:48.125
I've brought you your marching orders.

01:33:53.833 --> 01:33:57.458
I belong with those who are in pain,
and...

01:33:57.417 --> 01:33:58.750
who have lost their faith.

01:33:58.792 --> 01:34:00.417
I belong here.

01:34:02.208 --> 01:34:04.417
I am very disappointed, you know.

01:34:05.292 --> 01:34:11.042
When you requested permission to
accompany the recruits from your parish,

01:34:10.917 --> 01:34:13.208
I personally vouched for you.

01:34:15.167 --> 01:34:18.667
But then, when I heard what happened...

01:34:19.625 --> 01:34:21.208
I prayed for you.

01:34:25.542 --> 01:34:30.542
I sincerely believe
that Our Lord Jesus Christ guided me

01:34:31.375 --> 01:34:35.208
in what was the most important mass
of my life.

01:34:37.792 --> 01:34:41.208
I tried to be true to His trust

01:34:42.125 --> 01:34:46.917
and carry His message to all,
whoever they may be.

01:34:46.833 --> 01:34:50.542
Those men who listened to you
on Christmas Eve

01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:54.000
will very soon bitterly regret it.

01:34:53.958 --> 01:34:55.583
Because in a few days' time

01:34:55.625 --> 01:35:00.417
their regiment is to be disbanded
by order of His Majesty the King.

01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:05.958
Where will those poor boys end up
on the front line now?

01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:09.500
And what will their families think?

01:35:09.458 --> 01:35:12.500
Excuse me, Your Grace.
The boys are ready.

01:35:12.458 --> 01:35:13.500
Yes.

01:35:15.833 --> 01:35:18.583
They're waiting for me,
to preach a sermon

01:35:18.583 --> 01:35:22.958
to the soldiers replacing those
who went astray with you.

01:35:25.458 --> 01:35:29.708
May our Lord Jesus Christ
guide your steps back

01:35:29.625 --> 01:35:31.833
to the straight and narrow path.

01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:36.958
Is that truly the path of our Lord?

01:35:41.042 --> 01:35:43.333
You're not asking the right question.

01:35:44.417 --> 01:35:45.792
Think about this:

01:35:46.917 --> 01:35:52.792
are you really suitable to remain
among us, in the house of our Lord?

01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:29.333
Christ our Lord said:

01:36:29.375 --> 01:36:32.125
Think not that I come
to bring peace on Earth.

01:36:32.125 --> 01:36:36.375
I come not to bring peace, but a sword.

01:36:37.083 --> 01:36:39.625
The Gospel according to Saint Matthew.

01:36:44.708 --> 01:36:46.542
Well, my brethren,

01:36:46.583 --> 01:36:49.542
the sword of the Lord is in your hands.

01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:54.125
You are the very defenders
of civilization itself.

01:36:54.042 --> 01:36:58.042
The forces of good
against the forces of evil.

01:36:59.083 --> 01:37:05.542
For this war is indeed a crusade,

01:37:06.125 --> 01:37:08.542
a holy war

01:37:08.542 --> 01:37:12.333
to save the freedom of the world.

01:37:12.792 --> 01:37:14.625
In truth, I tell you,

01:37:16.167 --> 01:37:18.458
the Germans do not act like us,

01:37:18.458 --> 01:37:20.625
neither do they think like us,

01:37:20.625 --> 01:37:23.208
for they are not, like us,

01:37:23.792 --> 01:37:25.875
children of God.

01:37:27.333 --> 01:37:33.917
Are those who shell cities populated
only by civilians,

01:37:33.750 --> 01:37:36.208
the children of God?

01:37:36.208 --> 01:37:39.917
Are those who advance armed,

01:37:39.875 --> 01:37:44.042
hiding behind women and children,

01:37:43.958 --> 01:37:46.125
the children of God?

01:37:48.583 --> 01:37:50.500
With God's help,

01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:54.875
you must kill the Germans,

01:37:54.833 --> 01:37:58.750
good or bad, young or old.

01:37:58.708 --> 01:38:01.208
Kill every one of them,

01:38:02.458 --> 01:38:06.000
so it won't have to be done again.

01:38:09.833 --> 01:38:12.125
The Lord be with you!

01:38:12.125 --> 01:38:13.708
And also with you!

01:38:13.792 --> 01:38:16.375
May God Almighty bless you,

01:38:16.375 --> 01:38:21.125
the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost.

01:38:21.042 --> 01:38:23.625
Amen.

01:38:40.167 --> 01:38:41.958
Everyone to their posts!

01:38:42.458 --> 01:38:43.833
Every man to his post!

01:38:43.875 --> 01:38:44.917
Quickly!

01:38:47.125 --> 01:38:48.958
No, stay here!

01:38:48.958 --> 01:38:52.667
What're you doing? Come back!

01:38:53.625 --> 01:38:57.167
What the hell are you doing?
Shoot the bloody Kraut!

01:38:57.125 --> 01:38:58.500
What are you waiting for?

01:38:58.542 --> 01:39:01.292
Shoot him, goddammit! Holidays are over!

01:39:06.333 --> 01:39:09.292
What the hell do you think
you're playing at?

01:39:09.667 --> 01:39:10.958
Shoot him!

01:39:12.583 --> 01:39:14.083
Shoot him!

01:39:20.792 --> 01:39:22.833
Stand down from your posts.

01:39:29.625 --> 01:39:31.458
Shame on you, Gordon.

01:39:32.833 --> 01:39:34.208
Shame on you.

01:40:00.250 --> 01:40:03.250
Be silly to die
disguised as a German, eh Sir?

01:40:05.958 --> 01:40:07.542
What the devil were you doing?

01:40:10.708 --> 01:40:12.792
I had a German help me...

01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:17.958
Saw my mother.

01:40:20.458 --> 01:40:22.708
We drank a coffee, just like before.

01:40:25.917 --> 01:40:27.833
You have a son.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.750
Henri, his name is...

01:41:40.333 --> 01:41:41.875
How did you let yourself...

01:41:41.917 --> 01:41:43.667
If you came to preach, leave now!

01:41:43.708 --> 01:41:46.500
Don't you realize the gravity of this?

01:41:46.958 --> 01:41:50.000
It's high treason! Punishable by death.

01:41:51.417 --> 01:41:53.958
Only, we can't execute 200 men.

01:41:54.625 --> 01:41:55.958
That's all that saves you.

01:41:57.500 --> 01:42:01.333
Not counting all the other cases
of fraternization reported since.

01:42:01.958 --> 01:42:03.833
If public opinion hears of this...

01:42:04.417 --> 01:42:08.167
Have no fear, none here will tell.

01:42:08.125 --> 01:42:09.208
I hope not!

01:42:09.833 --> 01:42:11.708
Who'd want to! Want to?

01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:14.833
The men involved feel no shame.

01:42:14.792 --> 01:42:19.125
If they won't tell, it's because
none would believe or understand.

01:42:19.083 --> 01:42:23.292
Carousing with the enemy
while the country's partly occupied!

01:42:23.250 --> 01:42:27.625
The country? What does it know
of what we suffer here?

01:42:28.708 --> 01:42:30.458
Of what we do, without complaint?

01:42:31.375 --> 01:42:34.042
Let me tell you,
I felt closer to the Germans

01:42:34.042 --> 01:42:37.625
than those who cry Kill the Krauts!
Before their stuffed turkey!

01:42:38.542 --> 01:42:40.500
You're talking nonsense.

01:42:40.542 --> 01:42:43.750
No, you're just not
living the same war as me.

01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:45.250
As those across the way.

01:42:47.083 --> 01:42:49.500
You and your men
will rejoin the Verdun sector.

01:42:51.625 --> 01:42:53.125
You're right about one thing.

01:42:54.042 --> 01:42:55.667
I don't understand this war.

01:42:57.333 --> 01:42:59.375
My corps was the cavalry.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.542
You should've made a career of it,
like I said.

01:43:04.792 --> 01:43:08.958
Today, I'm asked to fight a war
where the shovel outweighs the rifle.

01:43:10.333 --> 01:43:13.083
In which people swap addresses
with the enemy,

01:43:13.083 --> 01:43:14.958
to meet when it's all over...

01:43:17.625 --> 01:43:23.250
Plus the cat we found with a note
from the Germans: Good luck, comrades!

01:43:23.125 --> 01:43:27.750
I was ordered to arrest the cat
for high treason...

01:43:30.208 --> 01:43:31.458
Until further notice.

01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:35.000
You're a grandfather, Dad.

01:43:50.125 --> 01:43:51.583
His name is Henri.

01:43:53.875 --> 01:43:55.125
What are you on about?

01:43:58.375 --> 01:43:59.917
How do you know that?

01:44:00.958 --> 01:44:03.708
You wouldn't understand.

01:44:06.167 --> 01:44:07.292
Henri?

01:44:10.792 --> 01:44:12.000
Not bad.

01:44:14.167 --> 01:44:15.667
Henri Audebert!

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.417
Let's try and survive this war for him.

01:44:30.250 --> 01:44:31.417
Chin up.

01:44:57.958 --> 01:44:59.292
Be seated!

01:45:04.292 --> 01:45:08.750
In two days' time
you will be in East-Prussia

01:45:08.667 --> 01:45:12.875
to take part in an offensive
against the Russian army.

01:45:12.792 --> 01:45:17.583
I hope you'll show pugnacity
in the face of the enemy.

01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:21.125
This train will cross the fatherland,

01:45:21.125 --> 01:45:24.458
but it won't be possible
for you to see your families.

01:45:24.458 --> 01:45:26.292
Why?

01:45:26.333 --> 01:45:27.875
I think you can guess.

01:45:30.958 --> 01:45:32.583
Long live Kaiser Wilhelm!

01:45:32.625 --> 01:45:34.083
Long live the Kaiser!

01:45:53.250 --> 01:45:56.125
They hand it out to just anybody!

01:47:58.875 --> 01:48:01.250
This film is dedicated to the soldiers

01:48:01.292 --> 01:48:05.333
who fraternized on Christmas 1914
in several places on the front.
