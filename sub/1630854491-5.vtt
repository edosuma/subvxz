on our team, remember?

00:19.185 --> 00:20.311
DAWN: Oh yeah!

00:20.353 --> 00:22.397
Then I hope you're ready
for the heat, Guy,

00:22.439 --> 00:25.734
'cause Eep's got the heat,
and she's gonna <i>give it to you!</i>

00:25.775 --> 00:27.193
<i>And it's gonna be so hot,</i>

00:27.235 --> 00:29.195
<i>it's gonna start a fire,</i>
<i>and then everything on the farm</i>

00:29.237 --> 00:31.573

00:31.614 --> 00:32.991
[gasps]

00:33.033 --> 00:35.160
Maybe we should
get some buckets of water.

00:35.201 --> 00:37.412
-It's fine, Dawn!
I can handle the heat!

00:37.454 --> 00:39.539
-Hey, are we playing
stick fruit here or what?!

00:39.581 --> 00:41.374
'Cause this heat's
starting to cool off.

00:41.416 --> 00:44.169
-I was ready to play before
any of us were even born!

00:44.210 --> 00:45.712
-What?
-Yeah, scratch that.

00:45.754 --> 00:46.796
It sounded better in my head.

00:46.838 --> 00:48.006
Can you throw
the fruit now, please?

00:48.048 --> 00:49.883
-Ho, ho! Gladly.

00:49.924 --> 00:52.969
-Please don't hit it to me.
Please don't hit it to me...

00:53.011 --> 00:56.598
Wait. I'm the only one out here,
and I can't handle the heat.

00:56.639 --> 00:57.891
Why did I agree to this?

00:57.932 --> 00:59.434

-EEP: Sure!

01:05.899 --> 01:07.317
That's what
the crashing sound was!

01:07.359 --> 01:09.652
-Nice try, Dawn,
but for next time,

01:09.694 --> 01:11.905
I find keeping
your eyes open helps.

01:11.946 --> 01:13.365
-Well, where'd it go, then?

01:13.406 --> 01:14.741
-Into your mom and dad's hut!

01:14.783 --> 01:16.368
I'll go clean up the mess
before they see it.

01:16.409 --> 01:18.078
In and out
like it never happened.

01:18.119 --> 01:19.245
-No, I'll do it.

01:19.287 --> 01:20.914
I'm the one
who missed the catch.

[panting]

It was close, though, right?

like a grown-up.

It's the bracelet. Who knew
the coolest thing on the farm

03:17.405 --> 03:19.824
has been on the farm
this whole time! Check it out.

in a basket in your room.

-Mm-hmm...

afternoon--
-Yes, Dawn. All the time.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.568
But I only wear it
on special occasions

03:55.610 --> 03:57.404
because it's <i>very</i>special.

03:57.445 --> 03:59.531
Your father gave it to me
when you were born.

03:59.572 --> 04:02.200
It was the second best gift
I got that day.

Can I borrow it?

will happen to it!

- <i>Sure</i>. Just like nothing
happened to my vase.

04:17.882 --> 04:20.844
Dawn! Can you bring me
a vase for these flowers?

04:20.885 --> 04:22.220
-You got it, Mom!

04:35.984 --> 04:37.944
-Whoa!
-[crash]

04:37.986 --> 04:41.114
-Or another lamp that you're
moving now for some reason.

04:41.156 --> 04:43.283
-Just trying to
<i>keep things light.</i>

04:43.324 --> 04:45.285
Heh? Whoa! [grunts]

04:45.326 --> 04:47.579
-Why yes, Dawn! I <i>would</i>like

04:47.620 --> 04:49.831
-a closer look at this lamp.
-Thanks.

04:49.873 --> 04:52.459
-This bracelet is
very important to me, Dawn.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.461
Maybe you can borrow it
when you're a little older.

04:54.502 --> 04:57.547
And a little more <i>responsible</i>.
And a little less <i>droppy</i>.

04:57.589 --> 04:59.716
-Please, Mom!
I'm responsible now!

04:59.758 --> 05:02.802
I swear! I can prove it!
[hopeful whine]

05:02.844 --> 05:04.262
-Hm... Hm!

05:04.304 --> 05:06.848
You know what? You're right.
How can you be responsible

05:06.890 --> 05:09.225
if you never get a chance
to learn responsibility?

05:09.267 --> 05:11.978
So, yes.
You can borrow the bracelet.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.563
-Really? Woo!

05:13.605 --> 05:16.107
Uh, that's a <i>responsible</i>woo.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.235
-But, you have to promise me
you'll take care of it.

05:19.277 --> 05:20.987
-I will!
-And that you won't lose it,

05:21.029 --> 05:22.947
-break it, or drop it in lava.
-I won't!

05:22.989 --> 05:26.117
-And that you'll bring it back
before dinner! [sighs]

05:26.159 --> 05:28.995
Seeing it after all this time
makes me want to wear it again.

05:29.037 --> 05:32.123
-[intense voice]:
<i>It's on like Dawn, Mom!</i>

05:32.165 --> 05:34.376
-Hm...

05:34.417 --> 05:37.962
-Hm... Too much?
-Just a touch.

05:38.004 --> 05:41.174
-[Eep grunts]
-[laughing] Higher! Higher!

Maybe we take a swing break.

05:47.972 --> 05:49.015
And a moving break.

05:49.057 --> 05:52.018
Oh! Broken ribs.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.311
-Hey, guys! What's up.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.563
-Dawn? What are you doing
in the progress pod?

05:55.605 --> 05:57.482
-Being responsible!

05:57.524 --> 05:58.942
This is the only way
to make sure

05:58.983 --> 06:00.819
nothing happens
to my mom's bracelet.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.862
-Could I borrow that
before Eep breaks me?

06:02.904 --> 06:05.365
-You're fine, Guy.
You just need harder bones.

06:05.407 --> 06:07.701
Don't you think that's
going too far, Dawn?

06:07.742 --> 06:09.494
You can't do anything
in that thing.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.162
-You can't be too careful.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.873
And I can do lots of things
in the progress pod.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.458
Check this out!

06:15.500 --> 06:16.751
[Dawn grunting]

06:18.336 --> 06:20.046
Pretty sweet, huh?

06:20.088 --> 06:22.382
-You barely moved, and now,
you're stuck in a hole.

06:22.424 --> 06:25.260
-Sounds perfect. Sign me up.

06:25.301 --> 06:26.845
-You know what? You're right.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.431
I've got a better idea.
Be right back.

06:29.472 --> 06:32.517
[Dawn struggling, straining]

06:32.559 --> 06:34.185
Am I moving yet?!

06:35.437 --> 06:37.230
See? Much better, right?

06:37.272 --> 06:39.149
-Boarnet nest?
This should be fine.

06:39.190 --> 06:43.153
-Guy, it's an empty nest.
And now, I can actually move!

06:43.194 --> 06:45.405
-Yeah, but why a boarnet's nest?

06:45.447 --> 06:46.531
-Think about it.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.907
When's the last time
<i>you</i>messed

06:47.949 --> 06:49.367
with a boarnet nest?

06:49.409 --> 06:52.287
-Never. Oh! Got it!

06:52.328 --> 06:53.997
-Huh, clever.
-Yes, it is.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.416
There's just one drawback
to boarnets' nests.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.835
-Yeah? What's that?
-The boarnets!

06:58.877 --> 07:00.587
-[buzzing]
-Oh no. They're coming home.

07:00.628 --> 07:03.757
-Run!
-[all screaming]

07:07.093 --> 07:08.845
What if I freeze myself
in a block of ice?

07:08.887 --> 07:11.139
And that way, you could
actually <i>see</i>the bracelet?

07:11.181 --> 07:12.682
-Ooh. We could use you
as a human sled,

07:12.724 --> 07:14.017
and the bracelet would be safe!

07:14.059 --> 07:15.727
-Sounds like a win-win to me.
-Although,

07:15.769 --> 07:17.312
if the bracelet is already safe,

07:17.354 --> 07:19.272
-then how can I keep it safe?
-Wait, what?

07:19.314 --> 07:22.484
-Which means... I need to put
the bracelet in danger!

07:22.525 --> 07:24.694
-I don't think that's what
Hope meant by "keep it safe."

07:24.736 --> 07:26.571
-Or it's <i>exactly</i>
what she meant.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.573
Either way, Dawn,
I support your decision,

07:28.615 --> 07:30.742
no matter how great
or terrible it is!

07:30.784 --> 07:34.037
-Eep, you having my back
means everything to me.

07:34.079 --> 07:36.331
[intense voice]:
<i>Now, let's go lava jumping!</i>

07:36.373 --> 07:38.124
I mean, what's
the worst that could happen?

07:38.166 --> 07:40.043
-Not a lot of good things
come after the question,

07:40.085 --> 07:41.461
"What's the worst
that could happen?"

-That's the spirit! [laughing]

07:42.837 --> 07:44.547

08:14.703 --> 08:17.205
-Maybe it wants to go back to
the farm where it'll be safe?

08:17.247 --> 08:20.166
-Hm, I don't think so.
I think it wants to go...

08:20.208 --> 08:21.918
[intense voice]:
<i>rollerlogging!</i>

08:21.960 --> 08:24.796
-On the rollercoaster!

08:24.838 --> 08:28.133
-[laughter, cheering]
-[rumbling]

08:28.174 --> 08:29.843
-[gasps]
Dawn! The bracelet!

08:29.884 --> 08:31.761
-I got this!

08:31.803 --> 08:34.347
[grunts, giggles]
Yeah!

08:34.389 --> 08:36.016
-Relax, Guy!

08:36.057 --> 08:37.726
What's the worst
that can happen?

08:37.767 --> 08:39.310
-Why does everyone
keep saying that?!

08:40.478 --> 08:42.689
-That was amazing!

08:42.731 --> 08:44.274
-Which part?
-All of the parts!

08:44.315 --> 08:46.651
And of course nothing
happened to the bracelet

08:46.693 --> 08:48.695
because I <i>knew</i>it wouldn't!

08:48.737 --> 08:49.821
-I was wrong, Dawn.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.781
You took that bracelet
to the limit

08:51.823 --> 08:53.825
-and brought it home safe.
-Yeah!

08:53.867 --> 08:56.119
Because she's responsible,
even when she's not!

08:56.161 --> 08:57.328
-What?
-That's right!

08:57.370 --> 09:00.040
This bracelet has never
been in safer hands.

09:00.081 --> 09:01.124
-Okay, but maybe those hands

09:01.166 --> 09:02.542
should stop
throwing it in the air.

09:02.584 --> 09:03.960
-Guy, relax!

09:04.002 --> 09:05.545
-What's the worst that could--
-[screech]

09:05.587 --> 09:07.630
happen? No!

09:07.672 --> 09:10.300
[all panting]

09:10.342 --> 09:13.470
Okay. This is obviously not
the best-case scenario,

09:13.511 --> 09:14.804
but it's also not the worst.

09:14.846 --> 09:17.098
I mean, my mom said
she hasn't worn it in moons,

09:17.140 --> 09:19.392
so she's probably already
forgotten about it.

09:19.434 --> 09:22.479
-Unless she's planning on
wearing it tonight,
like she said.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.981
-[gasps] Thank you
for that reminder, Guy.

09:25.023 --> 09:27.650
Well, looks like I have
until dinner to fix this.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.527
-Or you could do
the responsible thing

09:29.569 --> 09:31.237
and tell your mom what happened.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.073
-Pretty sure
the responsible thing to do

09:33.114 --> 09:35.533
is to <i>not</i>tell my mom
I was irresponsible.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.868
-That actually makes sense.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.079
-Guy! Stop being so negative!

09:39.120 --> 09:41.498
Oh. I just realized you agreed.
Never mind!

09:41.539 --> 09:43.667
-Great! We're all on
the same leaf page.

09:43.708 --> 09:46.044
Now, let's go. I have an idea.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.171
Uh, do we get to hear what it is
before doing it?

09:48.213 --> 09:49.756
DAWN: Nope!

09:49.798 --> 09:51.508
My mom will never know
the difference!

09:51.549 --> 09:53.009
I totally nailed it!

09:53.051 --> 09:55.345
-Uh, you mean you hit it
with a hammer?

09:55.387 --> 09:57.305
EEP: O-oh... Uh...

09:57.347 --> 09:58.890
I thought
the bracelet was shinier

09:58.932 --> 10:00.392
and had less... lumps

10:00.433 --> 10:03.353
and didn't make me shiver
when I looked at it. [shivers]

10:03.395 --> 10:06.106
-Dawn, do you think this looks
like <i>a</i>bracelet,

10:06.147 --> 10:07.399
let alone your mom's bracelet?

10:07.440 --> 10:09.401
-Not even a little,
but you heard my mom.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.528
She's planning to wear
that bracelet tonight.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.029
Maybe she won't notice?

10:13.071 --> 10:15.073
-Sure! If your mom
forgets how to see.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.908
- <i>Or</i>if she forgets how to see!

10:16.950 --> 10:18.410
-I already said that one.

10:19.536 --> 10:20.912
And... problem solved.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.455
-Ah! You're right!

10:22.497 --> 10:24.708
Even before it turned to dust,
it didn't look like a shell.

10:24.749 --> 10:27.043
[hyperventilating] Oh!

10:27.085 --> 10:29.671
But I know where
we can <i>find</i>a shell!

10:29.713 --> 10:31.172
-Ah!

10:31.214 --> 10:33.258
-There are so many shells,

10:33.299 --> 10:35.552
but none of them look like
the one from my mom's bracelet!

10:35.593 --> 10:38.221
-No, but...
Ah, this one looks like Thunk!

10:38.263 --> 10:40.098
-Hang on! I think I got it!

10:40.140 --> 10:41.683
-Guy, you did it!

10:41.725 --> 10:43.435
It looks exactly the same!

10:43.476 --> 10:47.897
-Beep, beep, beep,
beep, beep, beep...

10:47.939 --> 10:49.816
-Dad? What are you doing?

10:49.858 --> 10:53.028
-I'm looking for lobstingrays
using my latest invention,

10:53.069 --> 10:55.822
The Betterman Sand Scan. Beep.

10:55.864 --> 10:58.074
Beep. Beep. Beep.
-Why are you making
that beeping noise?

10:58.116 --> 11:00.702
-I can't explain it.
It just <i>feels</i>right.

11:00.744 --> 11:03.913
That shell. It reminds me
of a shell I gave your mother.

11:03.955 --> 11:06.249
May I? Same luster.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.043
* *

11:08.084 --> 11:09.919
Same spiral pattern!

11:09.961 --> 11:12.464
-[blows]
-[echoing goat scream]

11:12.505 --> 11:13.840
But it's not the same.

11:13.882 --> 11:15.633
I tuned the shell
I gave your mother

11:15.675 --> 11:17.010
so that when you blow into it,

11:17.052 --> 11:19.929
it makes
a very <i>particular</i>sound.

11:19.971 --> 11:22.766
And <i>that's</i>definitely
not the sound.

11:22.807 --> 11:23.975
-[Hope groans]
-Yes,

11:24.017 --> 11:26.394
your mother's shell
is truly one of a kind.

11:26.436 --> 11:29.731
Completely unique
and utterly irreplaceable.

11:29.773 --> 11:31.024
-What sound did it make?

11:31.066 --> 11:32.609
-Well, it was-- Ah!

11:32.650 --> 11:35.612
[screaming]

11:35.653 --> 11:38.198
-Why would anyone
want a bracelet
that sounds like that?

11:38.239 --> 11:40.742
-Well, I guess there's only
one thing left to do.

11:40.784 --> 11:42.410
-Tell your mom the truth?
-No!

11:42.452 --> 11:45.455
We have to go get the bracelet
back from that eelgle.

11:45.497 --> 11:47.624
-Yes! Road trip!

11:47.665 --> 11:49.167
-[pinching]
-[screaming]

11:49.209 --> 11:51.127
-They have formed an alliance!

11:51.169 --> 11:54.297
It's a briny uprising!
[screams]

11:54.339 --> 11:57.509
-Okay, we should probably
help my dad first. But then...

11:57.550 --> 11:59.094
BOTH: Road trip!

11:59.135 --> 12:01.638
[pinching]
-Ah! They attack in threes!

12:01.680 --> 12:03.556
Threes! Ah!

12:03.598 --> 12:05.975
-[bird screeching]
-GUY: So there I was,

12:06.017 --> 12:08.103
surrounded by eelgles!

12:08.144 --> 12:11.106
To my left! Eelgle!
To my right! Eelgle!

12:11.147 --> 12:12.565
-Behind me!
-Eelgle.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.609
We get it, Guy-baby.
You were surrounded.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.820
-Sorry. Anyway,
they took me to their nest

12:16.861 --> 12:19.698
at the top of the spire.
So, that's where we're going.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.907
* *

12:20.949 --> 12:22.242
-Ooh, if only my mom could see

12:22.283 --> 12:23.827
how responsible I'm being.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.161
I mean, sure, it's to fix

12:25.203 --> 12:27.288
the irresponsible
thing I did, but still!

12:27.330 --> 12:29.874
Thanks for coming with me
to get the bracelet back, guys.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.334
-No problem, Dawn.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.128
Although the chance of this
working is about the same

12:33.169 --> 12:34.963
as the chance
of Thunk running voluntarily.

12:35.005 --> 12:36.506
-Which means there's a chance!

12:36.548 --> 12:38.883
-You know, Dawn, you're right.
I'm on board!

12:38.925 --> 12:40.885
Because I'm in too deep
not to be!

12:40.927 --> 12:42.929
-Get on board
or get left behind, Guy!

12:42.971 --> 12:44.723
Oh. You're on board!
Never mind.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.142
[snoring]

12:47.183 --> 12:49.936
-Uh, I think someone else
is on board, too.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.354
EEP: Thunk?

12:51.396 --> 12:53.523
THUNK: [gasps]
Ah, what? Seriously?

12:53.565 --> 12:56.234
Where must I go to find
a moment's nap peace?

12:56.276 --> 12:58.528
Why won't anyone respect
my nap boundaries?

12:58.570 --> 13:01.406
Now, turn this beast around
and take me home!

13:01.448 --> 13:03.950
-Sorry, Thunk. There's no time
to turn back now.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.577
And definitely no time for naps.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.371
I have <i>one</i>chance to prove
I'm responsible!

13:08.413 --> 13:09.789
So we're getting
that bracelet back

13:09.831 --> 13:13.168
if it destroys me and everyone
I have ever loved!

13:13.209 --> 13:14.794
Which I really hope
doesn't happen.

13:14.836 --> 13:16.921
-Okay, I'm with you all the way,

13:16.963 --> 13:19.132
right after I catch a few Z's.

-[snarling, growling]
-You can do it, Chunky!

13:28.350 --> 13:30.060
You can jump this ravine!

13:30.101 --> 13:32.062
-Or we could take the bridge?

13:32.103 --> 13:33.229
* *

13:33.271 --> 13:35.940
-There should really be a sign.

-[grunting, yelling]
-[Chunky growling]

13:37.859 --> 13:40.403
Almost made it that time,
Chunky! Let's try it again!

13:40.445 --> 13:42.989
-And maybe we can use
the stairs this time?

13:43.031 --> 13:45.283
* *

13:45.325 --> 13:47.744
-Yeah, and a sign
would have helped.

13:47.786 --> 13:49.537
[growling]

13:49.579 --> 13:51.498
* *

13:51.539 --> 13:53.750
GUY: Well, I think there's
an obvious path to take here.

13:53.792 --> 13:56.044
-Right. The one that
looks like a dream.

13:56.086 --> 13:58.672
-[birds chirping]
-[snarling]

13:58.713 --> 14:01.549
Seriously, this area
needs a bunch of signs!

14:01.591 --> 14:05.261
-[screaming]
-[creatures roaring]

14:09.432 --> 14:11.726
Good news.
The bracelet is in the nest.

14:13.103 --> 14:14.187
[growls]

14:14.229 --> 14:16.147
GUY: Bad news.
There's also an eelgle.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.692
And if you thought eelgles
were a problem in the wild,

14:18.733 --> 14:20.527
wait till you invade their home.

14:20.568 --> 14:21.861
-Well, we don't have a choice.

14:21.903 --> 14:23.530
We <i>have</i>to get
that bracelet back,

14:23.571 --> 14:24.781
and I've got a plan.

14:24.823 --> 14:26.449
But we're gonna
need feathers, bamboo,

14:26.491 --> 14:28.034
and the part of Guy's brain
that builds stuff.

14:28.076 --> 14:32.122
-My brain is in your hands.
-EEP/DAWN: Ew.

14:32.163 --> 14:36.209
-Here it is! I've taken feather
gliding to the next level.

14:36.251 --> 14:38.628
I'm calling it the Guy Glider.

14:38.670 --> 14:41.297
-What about the Guyder? [laughs]

14:41.339 --> 14:42.549
-You're a genius!

14:42.590 --> 14:44.175
Guyder's so much better!

14:44.217 --> 14:45.760
[both laugh]

14:45.802 --> 14:47.137
-Is it, though?

14:47.178 --> 14:49.347
-Love the energy, guys,
but let's go over the plan.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.266
By harnessing
the power of the wind,

14:51.307 --> 14:53.727
Guy will silently glide
over to the nest,

14:53.768 --> 14:55.562
grab the bracelet noiselessly,

14:55.603 --> 14:56.855
and then,
without waking the eelgle

14:56.896 --> 14:58.898
with even the <i>hint</i>of a peep,

14:58.940 --> 15:01.401
glide back here,
pick us up, and head home.

15:01.443 --> 15:03.278
All without making a sound.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.947
-So, I'm sensing
you want me to be quiet.

15:05.989 --> 15:08.366
-Exactly.
Oh, and one more thing, Guy.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.659
Be quiet.

15:09.701 --> 15:11.578
Are you <i>sure</i>you
don't want a Wing-Eep?

15:11.619 --> 15:14.456
-No. Not a chance.
This is <i>my</i>time.

15:14.497 --> 15:15.707
My moment.

15:15.749 --> 15:19.127
-And this is my nap time.
My nap moment.

15:19.878 --> 15:20.837
[grunting]

15:20.879 --> 15:22.130
-You really think
this will work?

15:22.172 --> 15:25.467
-Of course, it'll work!
Because it has to work.

15:25.508 --> 15:28.219
-Exactly. This works or Hope
never trusts Dawn again.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.472
-Guy...
-Sorry.

15:30.513 --> 15:31.973
Here we go. [grunts]

15:35.268 --> 15:36.978
Woo! Yeah!

15:37.020 --> 15:38.355
-Look at him soar.

15:38.396 --> 15:40.482
He's like a majestic eelgle.

15:40.523 --> 15:43.568
[cheering, laughing]

15:43.610 --> 15:45.570
-He seems so
comfortable up there.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.615
-Yeah.
It's like he owns the sky.

15:48.656 --> 15:51.951
And the birds and the clouds
are his sky furniture.

15:51.993 --> 15:55.246
-Yup. He's in complete
and absolute control.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.915
-He's the coolest.
-He's...

I'm a nest cleaner?
H-here to clean your nest?

16:19.354 --> 16:21.731
[Guy screaming]

16:21.773 --> 16:23.650
-At least he got the eelgle
out of the nest.

16:23.692 --> 16:27.237
-Which means the <i>nest</i>
is up to us. [giggles]

16:27.278 --> 16:28.488
-Nice one.
-Thanks.

16:28.530 --> 16:30.573
I've been sitting
on that one for a while.

16:30.615 --> 16:34.077
Like how an eelgle sits
on an egg? In its nest?

16:34.119 --> 16:34.911
-Yeah, no, I get it.

16:34.953 --> 16:36.663
-Chunky, you're up! [growls]

16:36.705 --> 16:39.374
All we need to do
is zipvine to the nest,

16:39.416 --> 16:41.209
grab the bracelet,
and get out of there.

16:42.043 --> 16:43.294
[grunts]

16:44.379 --> 16:45.630
[both cheer]

16:45.672 --> 16:48.174
Seems solid.
Time to put it to the nest,

16:48.216 --> 16:50.468
and put <i>us</i>to the nest.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.679
Because we're
<i>going</i>to the nest.

16:52.721 --> 16:54.055
-Every joke has its limit, Dawn.

16:54.097 --> 16:56.599
-Wait, what's Thunk gonna do?
-What he does best.

16:56.641 --> 16:58.601
-And he's already doing it.
-[snoring]

16:58.643 --> 16:59.602
-Let's do this.

16:59.644 --> 17:00.895
[both grunt]

17:02.355 --> 17:04.232
BOTH: Woo!

17:05.525 --> 17:07.152
All clear. Where's the bracelet?

17:07.193 --> 17:10.196
-This is just a-- Ah!
Misunderstanding!
I was just-- Whoa!

17:10.238 --> 17:12.240
Stealing something you love
from your home!

17:12.282 --> 17:15.201
Wait, no! That sounded
better in my head! Ah!

17:15.243 --> 17:18.038
-Uh, not sure how much
longer Guy can hang on,

17:18.079 --> 17:19.956
-so we've got to move fast.
-[giggles] Yeah.

17:19.998 --> 17:23.043
-We don't wanna <i>nest</i>this up.
-[screech]

17:23.084 --> 17:26.296
-Sorry. I have a problem.
Gotcha!

17:26.338 --> 17:28.923
Not a scratch on it!
Mom will never suspect a thing.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.217
[intense voice]:
<i>Who's responsible now, Mom?!</i>

17:31.259 --> 17:33.595
-You are, if she
never finds out about this.

17:33.636 --> 17:36.723
Now, let's get outta here
so Guy can land that
whatever it's called.

17:36.765 --> 17:39.351
-It's called a Guyder! Aah!

17:39.392 --> 17:40.393
[grunts]

17:40.435 --> 17:42.020
-Thunk!
I thought you were napping!

17:42.062 --> 17:45.482
-I was until your "woos"
rudely woke me.

17:45.523 --> 17:48.193
Also, vertical napping
is not ideal.

17:48.234 --> 17:52.030
But then, I saw something
soft and cozy and realized

17:52.072 --> 17:55.367
this nest is
the <i>perfect</i>nap nook.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.911
-You mean a nest rest?
-[screech]

17:57.952 --> 17:59.788
-[Eep groans]
-I need help.

17:59.829 --> 18:01.623
-You can't take
a nap right now, Thunk.

18:01.664 --> 18:03.249
We gotta get
this bracelet out of here

18:03.291 --> 18:04.876
before Guy crashes and burns.

18:04.918 --> 18:07.921
-Pretty bird! Pretty bird!
-[screams]

18:07.962 --> 18:10.674
-[vine straining]
-Oh, no, no, no! Ah!

18:10.715 --> 18:12.425
-That's not good.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.427
-Neither is that!

18:14.469 --> 18:15.970
Thunk! [grunts] Get up!

18:16.012 --> 18:18.098
You're not an eelgle!
You can't nap here!

18:18.139 --> 18:19.432
-Lemme try.

18:19.474 --> 18:21.976
-[grunts]
You brought a berry cake?

18:22.018 --> 18:23.353
-I always travel with snacks.

18:23.395 --> 18:25.772
Never know when there's gonna
be a Thunkmergency.

18:25.814 --> 18:28.983
[grunting, sniffing]

18:29.025 --> 18:31.611
-[chomp]
-Sleep eating? That's new.

18:31.653 --> 18:34.280
[yelling]

18:34.322 --> 18:36.616
[grunting, panting]

18:36.658 --> 18:38.159
Hang in there, Guy-boy!

18:38.201 --> 18:39.619
-I'm trying!

18:39.661 --> 18:42.539
-Dawn! What do we-- Ah!

18:42.580 --> 18:43.957
Dawn, you mind putting
that bracelet away?

18:43.998 --> 18:46.376
-It's kind of bright.
-Oops. Sorry.

18:46.418 --> 18:48.628
Wait. That's it! The bracelet!

18:48.670 --> 18:50.130
* *

18:50.171 --> 18:51.464
[screaming]

18:51.506 --> 18:53.133
[screeching]

18:53.174 --> 18:55.802
-[gasps] You did it!
-Yeah. If by "it,"

18:55.844 --> 18:58.972
you mean got the eelgle's
attention, then I sure did.

18:59.014 --> 19:01.891
-[screech]
-Yeah. That's about it.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.393
GUY: Coming in hot!

19:03.435 --> 19:04.561
Guyder grab!

19:04.602 --> 19:06.104
[Dawn and Eep grunt, cheer]

19:06.146 --> 19:08.732
* *

19:08.773 --> 19:10.275
-Thanks for the lift, Guy-boy!

19:10.316 --> 19:12.318
-No problem!
Except for all the problems.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.695
Did you get the bracelet?

19:13.737 --> 19:16.364
-I sure did!
-Nice! [laughs]

19:17.240 --> 19:18.366
What's with Thunk?

19:18.408 --> 19:20.952
-He finally found
his perfect nap spot.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.662
I almost feel bad
about moving him,

19:22.704 --> 19:24.289
but we had to.
Because Eelgle.

19:24.330 --> 19:27.167
-Guy, are you sure this Guyder
can hold all of us?

19:27.208 --> 19:30.295
-Nope. Not at all.
But someone wise once said,

19:30.337 --> 19:31.755
"What's the worst
that could happen?"

19:31.796 --> 19:33.715
-[screech]
-Oh!

19:33.757 --> 19:35.008
[all yelling]

19:35.050 --> 19:36.843
[roar]

19:36.885 --> 19:38.845

[screaming continues]

19:41.556 --> 19:42.557
[screech]

19:42.599 --> 19:44.476
-We're never
gonna lose that eelgle!

19:44.517 --> 19:46.186
-Yes, we are.

19:46.227 --> 19:49.564
Because it doesn't want us.
It wants this!

19:49.606 --> 19:50.899
-Dawn! No, you can't!

19:50.940 --> 19:53.568
-I can because I have to.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.236
[screech]

19:55.278 --> 19:58.114
We're not going down
because of a bracelet!

19:58.156 --> 19:59.199
-[cracking]
-Dawn's right!

19:59.240 --> 20:00.950
We're going down
because the Guyder

20:00.992 --> 20:02.452
is about to die-der!

20:02.494 --> 20:04.579

[cheering]

20:17.759 --> 20:18.885
DAWN: Great catch, Chunky!

20:18.927 --> 20:20.762
-Can someone close that window?

20:20.804 --> 20:22.681
It's a little drafty in here.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.307
-[sighs]
-[Chunky growls]

20:24.349 --> 20:26.309
-I can't believe you did that.
-Yeah.

20:26.351 --> 20:28.937
I think you would
have been better off
if that eelgle got us.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.189
Because that's nothing compared
to what your mom is going to do

20:31.231 --> 20:33.274
when you tell her
you lost her bracelet.

20:33.316 --> 20:34.609
-You mean...

20:34.651 --> 20:36.736
<i>-this</i>bracelet?
-[Eep and Guy gasp]

20:36.778 --> 20:39.989
-How? When? Why?
-What? Where? How?

20:40.031 --> 20:41.574
-I already said that one.
-Oh, right.

20:41.616 --> 20:43.159
-I gave the eelgle the bracelet

20:43.201 --> 20:44.911
with the shell
we found at the beach.

20:44.953 --> 20:47.580
<i>This</i>is the real one.
Now, let's get it back home

20:47.622 --> 20:49.749
before anything else
happens to it.

20:49.791 --> 20:52.043
Maybe you should hang onto it,
just in case.

20:52.085 --> 20:54.379
-Nah.
You're the responsible one.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.923
* *

20:56.965 --> 20:58.883
[insects chirping]

20:59.634 --> 21:01.594
* *

21:01.636 --> 21:03.096
-And... done.

21:03.138 --> 21:05.390
Like nothing ever happened.

21:05.432 --> 21:08.768
-Dawn? Wait for me, honey!
We'll go to dinner together!

21:08.810 --> 21:10.103
Just wanna grab my bracelet.

21:10.145 --> 21:11.813
You put it
back in my hut, right?

21:11.855 --> 21:13.148
-Uh, yup!

21:13.189 --> 21:15.567
-I still can't believe
I'd forgotten about this.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.110
Thanks for reminding me about it

21:17.152 --> 21:19.237
and for taking
such good care of it.

21:19.279 --> 21:22.157
-Okay, fine! I can't take it!
I lost your bracelet!

21:22.198 --> 21:23.366
And then I tried
to make a new one,

21:23.408 --> 21:24.784
but it looked like something
Chunky threw up.

21:24.826 --> 21:26.536
Then I found another one
that looked like it,

21:26.578 --> 21:28.830
but it wasn't, so then
I went to a mountain
and found the real one.

21:28.872 --> 21:30.874
And now I'm returning it
because you were right

21:30.915 --> 21:32.625
and I was wrong, and I'm sorry!
Please don't be mad!

21:32.667 --> 21:33.960
Whoa! I'm getting dizzy.

21:34.002 --> 21:36.755
-Head between your knees, Dawn.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.757
-Do you think I'm irresponsible?

21:38.798 --> 21:40.884
-Well, you did lose my bracelet,

21:40.925 --> 21:43.053
which was very irresponsible.

21:43.094 --> 21:44.137
[sighs]

21:44.179 --> 21:46.181
[groans]

21:46.222 --> 21:48.308
But, you did tell me the truth,

21:48.350 --> 21:51.853
and that's pretty responsible.
Which is bittersweet.

21:51.895 --> 21:54.314
It's hard for me to accept
that you're growing up.

21:54.356 --> 21:57.650
Seems like just yesterday,
you could barely walk.

21:57.692 --> 21:59.110
And now, look at you.

21:59.152 --> 22:02.489
A smart, beautiful young woman.

22:02.530 --> 22:05.241
Maybe I need to stop treating
you like you're a little girl

22:05.283 --> 22:07.494
because you're
not little anymore.

22:07.535 --> 22:09.662
But you will always be my girl.

22:09.704 --> 22:11.748
Besides, I'll always have this.

22:11.790 --> 22:14.209

-[echoing baby laugh]

22:14.918 --> 22:17.504
-Whoa. What is that?

22:17.545 --> 22:19.631
-That's you! I told your dad

22:19.673 --> 22:22.842
I never wanted to forget
the sound of my baby laughing.

22:22.884 --> 22:25.470
He figured out a way to make it
so I never would.

22:25.512 --> 22:26.763
* *

22:26.805 --> 22:30.183
-So, I'm not in trouble?
-Oh, sweetheart.

22:30.225 --> 22:32.644
You're in more trouble
than you know.

22:32.686 --> 22:34.604
-That's fair. Love you, Mom.

22:34.646 --> 22:36.064
-Love you, too, Dawn.

22:36.106 --> 22:38.024
-THUNK: I love <i>you</i>, Hope's bed.

22:38.066 --> 22:41.611
