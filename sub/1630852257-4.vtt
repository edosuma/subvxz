some matcha into the recipe,

05:32.791 --> 05:34.334
one of the first critiques,

05:34.376 --> 05:36.795
<i>Grandma Harriet said something
was earthy and spicy,</i>

05:36.836 --> 05:38.838

- You're the best.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.440
- Lines are way smoother,
lot faster.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.860

it brittle, doesn't it?

06:00.902 --> 06:02.278
- What?

06:02.320 --> 06:06.074
I would imagine you want to be
careful with that stuff.

06:06.116 --> 06:09.703
We have never made
a successful gingerbread house.

06:09.744 --> 06:12.580

this thing thinking, "Ay."

06:21.589 --> 06:23.049

06:23.091 --> 06:25.510

06:56.708 --> 06:58.543

07:00.003 --> 07:02.797

a bakery at some point

07:02.839 --> 07:04.132

the bakery business with him.

07:13.892 --> 07:16.061
So we're gonna do
oatmeal cream pies.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.604
Look at the gingerbread men.
- Excuse me.

07:17.645 --> 07:18.980

<i>- We're very excited about
the tree house of our dreams.</i>

18:45.333 --> 18:47.419
We just hope
that we can pull it off.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.839
- We need to figure out how
to suspend it above the board

18:50.880 --> 18:54.092
and have a tree come up
through the middle of it.

18:54.134 --> 18:57.012
- It's a lot to do,
and we're pretty nervous.

18:57.053 --> 18:59.014
We're gonna
make sponge toffee...

18:59.055 --> 19:00.348
- Ooh.

19:00.390 --> 19:02.600
- That looks like rocks
and boulders and things

19:02.642 --> 19:04.519
and then speculoos--
cookie goats

19:04.561 --> 19:05.854
and a little bride and groom.

19:05.895 --> 19:08.106
So we had goats
as our ring bearers.

19:08.148 --> 19:10.525
- Wait, goats were your
are actual ring bearers?

19:10.567 --> 19:11.860
- They were so naughty.

19:11.901 --> 19:14.195
They did not follow directions

19:14.237 --> 19:16.865
<i>and just ate the rose petals
all over the altar way.</i>

19:16.906 --> 19:18.992
- So you're telling me goats
were part of the ceremony

19:19.034 --> 19:20.577
and they didn't behave?
- They didn't behave.

19:20.618 --> 19:22.037
Shocker, right?
- They never behave.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.830
Our neighbors always call us,
and they're like,

19:23.872 --> 19:26.750
"Um, your goats
are on your roof."

19:26.791 --> 19:29.127
- Goats at the wedding?

19:29.169 --> 19:31.087
- You know what they say--
goats have more fun.

19:31.129 --> 19:32.339
- They do say that.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.716
- Until you eat them.

19:34.758 --> 19:37.886
And then they have
significantly less fun.

19:37.927 --> 19:41.723
- And then their zombie goats
come back and say,

19:41.765 --> 19:44.059
"You ate us.
Now you must die."

19:44.100 --> 19:45.268
- Yeah, and like,

19:45.310 --> 19:47.520
"The zombie goats
will take over the Earth."

19:47.562 --> 19:49.814
And that is why you can't
have a goat at your wedding.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.816
- Jinx!
-

- Are you gonna put eyes
and pants on them, too?

20:22.055 --> 20:24.391
- I think so.
- Okay.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.017
These are almost done.

20:26.059 --> 20:27.644
- Do you like 'em?
- I've seen better.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.689
<i>- We're halfway
through this bake,</i>

20:30.730 --> 20:32.107
and we are feeling
a little nervous

20:32.148 --> 20:33.775
because we look around
at these teams left,

20:33.817 --> 20:35.276
<i>and there are
some artistic people</i>

20:35.318 --> 20:37.195
<i>who we know have
some serious skill.</i>

20:37.237 --> 20:39.489
We're not artists, and so
I think decorating the house

20:39.531 --> 20:41.032
is probably my main concern--

20:41.074 --> 20:42.867
<i>trying to get what we have
in our head down on a plate.</i>

20:42.909 --> 20:45.829
- This guy can look outward,
like...

20:45.870 --> 20:48.248
Everybody waits in line.

20:48.289 --> 20:49.916
- Okay.

20:49.958 --> 20:52.794
Ready to assemble?
- Yeah, let's do this.

20:52.836 --> 20:55.171
Scoot that one back,
just, like, a half an inch.

20:56.715 --> 20:59.718
You think that works...
- Yeah.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.886
- Support-wise?
- Mm-hmm.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.639
I think that's at least enough
that it's gonna hold it.

21:04.681 --> 21:06.474
- Okay. Yeah.

21:06.516 --> 21:07.892
- Oh, my gosh.
- Amazing.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.645
- He's built.
- Okay. Cool.

21:10.687 --> 21:12.480
- What else do we need to do?

21:12.522 --> 21:14.399
<i>I'm really stressed right now,</i>

21:14.441 --> 21:17.277
and I have to focus
on all the intricate details

21:17.318 --> 21:19.946
<i>that I have to do
on the Taj Mahal.</i>

21:19.988 --> 21:22.991
Abhi, how does this look?
- Looks good.

21:23.033 --> 21:26.244
- The carvings and the
intricate details on Taj Mahal

21:26.286 --> 21:28.580
are really, really fine.

21:28.621 --> 21:34.085
So we will have to pipe it out
so neatly and very delicately.

21:34.127 --> 21:36.212
And I don't think
we have too much time

21:36.254 --> 21:39.549
to do all the detailing,
so I'm a little nervous.

21:39.591 --> 21:42.260
I just hope it stays.

21:42.302 --> 21:44.596
- Don't worry.

21:46.139 --> 21:48.975
- Both of these just broke off,
just picking it up.

21:49.017 --> 21:50.226
- What?

21:50.268 --> 21:52.187
- We are not doing well
at all.

21:52.228 --> 21:53.480
<i>- No.</i>

21:55.732 --> 21:57.942
I love it.
- And it's broken.

21:57.984 --> 22:00.153
<i>I don't particularly enjoy
putting together</i>

22:00.195 --> 22:03.782
gingerbread houses because
my sister kicks my tail

22:03.823 --> 22:07.285
every year
in a gingerbread competition.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.120
You know, like, I would live
in her gingerbread house.

22:09.162 --> 22:11.414
<i>So it brings back memories</i>

22:11.456 --> 22:14.376
and whatever else of always
not quite being perfect.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.714
- I don't even want to know.
I don't even want to know.

22:19.756 --> 22:21.299
- I'm--I'm nervous.

22:21.341 --> 22:23.134
- You guys are
a little quiet today.

22:23.176 --> 22:24.260
What's going on?

22:24.302 --> 22:25.804
- Yeah. 'Cause you hear
that banging?

22:25.845 --> 22:28.223
That's the sound you want to
hear with a gingerbread house.

22:28.264 --> 22:30.809
<i>So gingerbread is a little bit
of my nemesis, you know?</i>

22:30.850 --> 22:32.102
but we're gonna duke it out

22:32.143 --> 22:33.478
right here.
- Let's go.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.813
- How's that not lining up?
That's crazy.

22:34.854 --> 22:35.980
- I don't know.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.315
- Gerard and Shawn.

22:37.357 --> 22:38.775
- Gerard and Shawn.
- What's up, guys?

22:38.817 --> 22:40.151
- How you guys doing?

22:40.193 --> 22:42.320
- Why do you always show up
when we're failing?

22:42.362 --> 22:44.489
- I think it looks good.

22:44.531 --> 22:46.074
But I'm not wearing my glasses.

22:46.116 --> 22:47.951
- What's happening over here?
What are you making?

22:47.992 --> 22:50.662
- So we are building
a gingerbread house...

22:50.704 --> 22:52.831
- Yes. That's good.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.457
- Of our vacation dreams.

22:54.499 --> 22:56.126
- Yes.
- Tell me more.

22:56.167 --> 22:57.961
- Right? We're building
an over-the-water bungalow.

22:58.003 --> 22:59.129
- Mm-hmm.
- Ooh.

22:59.170 --> 23:00.255
- Okay?

23:00.296 --> 23:02.507
- We're gonna have
a cake on the bottom

23:02.549 --> 23:05.051
with frosting that looks like
the ocean...

23:05.093 --> 23:07.220
<i>complete with fishies
swimming.</i>

23:07.262 --> 23:10.348
<i>- Candy cane stilts to bring
it up over the water.</i>

23:10.390 --> 23:14.519
And then we're gonna use
the delicious blondie

23:14.561 --> 23:17.564
with pecans and caramel inside

23:17.605 --> 23:19.357
to build
a lot of the furniture.

23:19.399 --> 23:22.235
- Have you been on vacation
to a place like this?

23:22.277 --> 23:24.612
Like, is this
the ultimate dream?

23:24.654 --> 23:26.322
- Yeah, this is
the ultimate dream, absolutely.

23:26.364 --> 23:27.949
Have not been.

23:27.991 --> 23:30.535
Definitely think that's, like,
the most romantic.

23:30.577 --> 23:32.203
- Yeah. Same, by the way.

23:32.245 --> 23:34.414
I mean, I'm just saying
if you needed a third,

23:34.456 --> 23:35.665
you just let me know.

23:35.707 --> 23:37.208
- You can always be the third.

23:37.250 --> 23:39.419
- Did you just invite yourself
into his belated honeymoon?

23:39.461 --> 23:41.338
- Yes, I did.
I most certainly did.

23:41.379 --> 23:44.049
- It's our build today,
and there's been a struggle.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.092
- What has been challenging
about it?

23:46.134 --> 23:48.261
- Just--
I can't even begin to tell you.

23:48.303 --> 23:49.804
We love doing this. This is,
like, the best thing ever.

23:49.846 --> 23:51.306
- We love the build part.

23:51.348 --> 23:54.184
- Do you truly like the build?
- You know what?

23:55.769 --> 23:57.437
I thought you could smell
the sarcasm.

23:57.479 --> 24:00.440
- The candy canes have been
a huge challenge.

24:00.482 --> 24:01.733
- Yes.
- Right?

24:01.775 --> 24:03.818
From the initial cut,
and then getting 'em on

24:03.860 --> 24:06.863
is a whole other conversation
because they're so brittle.

24:06.905 --> 24:08.365
- Yeah.

24:08.406 --> 24:12.035
- You know, using isomalt
to attach them doesn't help.

24:12.077 --> 24:13.953
- Well,
if it's any consolation,

24:13.995 --> 24:15.622
I believe in you.
- Thank you.

24:15.663 --> 24:17.332
- As do I.
- That is a consolation.

24:17.374 --> 24:20.210
- And I think
it looks fantastic.

24:20.251 --> 24:21.336
- Thank you.

24:21.378 --> 24:22.754
- And I think
it looks really hard.

24:22.796 --> 24:24.464
<i>- Our concept is super risky.</i>

24:24.506 --> 24:27.217
We don't do anything
simply, right?

24:27.258 --> 24:28.551
- Even if it's not to code,

24:28.593 --> 24:30.720
just bribe the Grannies.
- Yeah.

24:30.762 --> 24:33.598
- When I was growing up, one
of the things that we wanted

24:33.640 --> 24:35.141
was an Easy-Bake Oven.

24:35.183 --> 24:36.893
Y'all remember those, right?
- Oh, I remember that.

24:36.935 --> 24:39.020
- Baking those, you know,
those little cakes,

24:39.062 --> 24:40.271
and you used the light.
- Yes. The mini things.

24:40.313 --> 24:41.606
- Yeah.

24:41.648 --> 24:43.441
- I asked Santa Claus
for a Ping-Pong table.

24:43.483 --> 24:45.985
There was a Ping-Pong table.
- Oh, my goodness--

24:46.027 --> 24:47.112
- I mean, I remember
that started crying.

24:47.153 --> 24:49.406
I'm getting
all choked up now.

24:49.447 --> 24:51.324
- You never get
over your dreams.

24:51.366 --> 24:53.451
- This Kleenex has been
overworked, you know?

24:53.493 --> 24:55.954
- Yeah, well, I dreamed about
sitting with all of you girls

24:55.995 --> 24:57.997
and doing
what we're doing today.

24:58.039 --> 25:01.001
Aw.
- You must be clairvoyant.

25:01.042 --> 25:03.962
- Andy and I love giving gifts,
right, Andy?

25:04.004 --> 25:05.880
- Yes. Every holiday season,

25:05.922 --> 25:09.426
me and Maya
buy gifts for everyone...

25:09.467 --> 25:11.386
- Around the world.
- On Earth, yeah.

25:11.428 --> 25:13.805
It's expensive.

25:13.847 --> 25:15.098
Hi, you guys.
-

25:15.140 --> 25:17.142
- We have a holiday gift
for you.

25:17.183 --> 25:20.311
- Oh, my God.
- That looks amazing.

25:20.353 --> 25:21.938
- Today everyone is being asked

25:21.980 --> 25:24.983
to create gingerbread houses
of their dreams.

25:25.025 --> 25:27.527
And I'm gonna be honest
with you--it's hard.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.946
- It is very difficult
to make a good one.

25:29.988 --> 25:32.741
- So we're gonna give everyone
holiday gifts

25:32.782 --> 25:35.076
to give 'em a little boost.

25:35.118 --> 25:36.745
- It's a little something me
and Maya threw together.

25:36.786 --> 25:38.163
- I mean...
- Oh, well,

25:38.204 --> 25:40.999
this is definitely going
on my Christmas tree for sure.

25:41.041 --> 25:44.294
I see chai.
- Well, we know you like it.

25:44.336 --> 25:46.004
- Oh, my God.
- Absolutely love it.

25:46.046 --> 25:48.173
- Spicy masala.
Thank you so much.

25:48.214 --> 25:50.550
- We'll definitely make this
by the fire side.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.886
- Then maybe you invite us over
'cause it sounds delicious.

25:52.927 --> 25:55.347
- Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
You don't need an invitation.

25:55.388 --> 25:56.681
- So the door's open?
- Always open.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.016
- Always.
- Always.

25:58.058 --> 25:59.434
- There's always gonna be
delicious bakes

25:59.476 --> 26:01.186
and maybe something
to drink as well.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.645
- Yeah.
- Now you're talking.

26:02.687 --> 26:06.566
- Now we are talking
the language of the gods.

26:06.608 --> 26:07.942
- Ooh.
- Bourbon?

26:07.984 --> 26:09.736
- Listen, if it has
grain alcohol in it,

26:09.778 --> 26:10.904
Andy's there.
- Yeah.

26:10.945 --> 26:13.239
I'm a perfectionist.
- It shows.

26:13.281 --> 26:15.867
- When it comes to giving gifts

26:15.909 --> 26:18.078
to bakers
inside a snow globe...

26:18.119 --> 26:20.246
- Uh-huh?
- I want to nail it.

26:20.288 --> 26:23.833
- What?
Get out of here.

26:23.875 --> 26:26.544
- They're for BFFs.
- BFFs only.

26:26.586 --> 26:29.047
- Did you whittle this
with your very own hands?

26:29.089 --> 26:30.674
- I'm a wittle-known whittler.

26:30.715 --> 26:31.925
- A wittle-known whittler.

26:31.966 --> 26:33.843
- He stole my joke.

26:33.885 --> 26:36.721
That's a great cup.
I'm so grateful.

26:36.763 --> 26:39.265
- Aw.
-

26:39.307 --> 26:41.893
- I love them.

26:41.935 --> 26:43.937
- That's perfect.
- I know.

26:43.978 --> 26:46.856
- "Keep taking whisks."
- Get it?

26:46.898 --> 26:48.942
- You guys.
- Thank you.

26:48.983 --> 26:51.986
- There's no gift receipt,
so smile.

26:52.028 --> 26:54.280
- They are not returnable.
- Just smile.

26:54.322 --> 26:56.408
- I feel like they actually
did love the gifts.

26:56.449 --> 26:58.243
- No, don't beat yourself up.

26:58.284 --> 27:02.038
- I think the reason
is because...

27:02.080 --> 27:04.165
they're not that great.

27:04.207 --> 27:06.960
- That's so nice.
- Oranges!

27:07.002 --> 27:08.586
- It's the thought that counts.

27:08.628 --> 27:12.590
I mean, we like giving gifts.
We're givers.

27:12.632 --> 27:14.843
- I noticed none of them
got gifts for us.

27:14.884 --> 27:17.595
- Yeah, I noticed that, too.

27:17.637 --> 27:19.472
I mean, I feel like
if we're giving gifts,

27:19.514 --> 27:22.809
like, someone should have
given us something,

27:22.851 --> 27:26.021
but we got nothing.
- Yeah.

27:26.062 --> 27:27.105

27:53.298 --> 27:55.091
It's kind nerve-racking,

27:55.133 --> 27:56.593

nerve-racking.

27:56.634 --> 27:59.929

It's just gonna fall down flat.

28:50.689 --> 28:52.190

- That's the problem.

the mango.

31:31.182 --> 31:32.642
It's just wonderful.

31:32.684 --> 31:34.728
- The cardamom could have
easily overpowered the mango.

31:34.769 --> 31:36.938
The sweetness is just perfect.

31:36.980 --> 31:39.899

32:00.337 --> 32:02.964
- Hello.
- Hi.

32:03.006 --> 32:04.924
- So my dream had always been
to go to Japan,

32:04.966 --> 32:07.469
<i>and so we built
a Japanese temple.</i>

32:07.510 --> 32:09.721
<i>And then there's a wheelchair
ramp because we think</i>

32:09.763 --> 32:11.931
that my brother would've
really enjoyed going to it.

32:11.973 --> 32:14.184
- The first thing
that I'm drawn to

32:14.225 --> 32:16.269
when I walk up here,
of course, is the smell.

32:16.311 --> 32:18.063
You can really
smell that ginger.

32:18.104 --> 32:19.397
- Yeah.

32:19.439 --> 32:21.441
- But your piping, you know,
that's got to be

32:21.483 --> 32:23.234
a little bit neater.
- Yeah.

32:23.276 --> 32:25.570
- Did you run into
some problems or something?

32:25.612 --> 32:28.031
- The construction
and holding the awnings

32:28.073 --> 32:31.409
in place took much longer.
- Okay.

32:31.451 --> 32:32.660
- I mean,
the idea is wonderful.

32:32.702 --> 32:35.663
The execution is fine,

32:35.705 --> 32:38.208
except that it isn't
touching the gingerbread.

32:38.249 --> 32:39.417
You've got gaps.

32:39.459 --> 32:41.002
I would've liked to see

32:41.044 --> 32:43.421
the construction
just a bit better.

32:43.463 --> 32:45.965
It definitely falls
a little short.

32:46.007 --> 32:47.384
- Yeah.

32:50.720 --> 32:51.971
- This is excellent.

32:52.013 --> 32:54.849
From the cookie
to the popcorn ball,

32:54.891 --> 32:56.976
I love it--
sticky, sticky, sticky.

32:57.018 --> 32:58.228
- Thank you so much.

32:58.269 --> 32:59.896
- Really different.
Really, really different.

32:59.938 --> 33:02.607
I forgot to mention this, too.

33:02.649 --> 33:04.734
I think putting the ramp in
for the wheelchair

33:04.776 --> 33:07.320
was really an incredible touch.
Thank you.

33:07.362 --> 33:09.489
- You guys, thank you.

33:09.531 --> 33:12.033

34:53.677 --> 34:55.387

34:55.428 --> 34:57.222
this is a beach bungalow.
- Mm-hmm.

34:57.263 --> 34:59.265

34:59.307 --> 35:01.101

35:02.686 --> 35:04.479
you may have had a problem
with that.

35:04.521 --> 35:06.147
- You know, I don't know if
it's gonna meet building code,

35:06.189 --> 35:08.692
'cause it's a little off
to the side.

35:08.733 --> 35:10.735
You know, rather that it be
a little sideways

35:10.777 --> 35:12.570
than, you know,
completely falling apart.

35:12.612 --> 35:14.906
So that was--we had to make
a decision then.

35:14.948 --> 35:17.867
- I love the whole theme.
I think it's fun.

35:17.909 --> 35:20.578
- Although
I have to be honest,

35:20.620 --> 35:23.081
your finishing is lacking.
- Mm-hmm.

35:23.123 --> 35:25.875
- You can see the cake
through the frosting.

35:25.917 --> 35:29.796
Your edges are not even.
- Okay.

35:31.214 --> 35:33.925
We went with a traditional
gingerbread cookie.

35:35.093 --> 35:37.053
- I think that the blondie
is delicious

35:37.095 --> 35:39.014
- Gingerbread's got
a little bite to it.

35:39.055 --> 35:40.890
I'm still tasting the bite.
That was good.

35:40.932 --> 35:42.767
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

35:42.809 --> 35:46.396
- The gingerbread
was a little bit too spicy.

35:46.438 --> 35:50.734
It wasn't my favorite,
but that blondie, right on.

35:50.775 --> 35:51.901
- It's a hit.

35:51.943 --> 35:53.820
I mean, It's just great.
- Thank you.

35:53.862 --> 35:55.739

35:55.780 --> 35:57.866
I like mine crispier.
- Crispier.

35:57.907 --> 35:59.492
- Yeah,
'cause it's a little soft.

35:59.534 --> 36:01.786

36:01.828 --> 36:03.830
- Andy, why are you shaking
your head?

36:03.872 --> 36:05.749
- Yeah, I don't really get down

36:05.790 --> 36:07.459

gingerbread cookies.

36:07.500 --> 36:09.711

36:16.092 --> 36:17.385

36:25.185 --> 36:26.728
I mean, we're pretty

36:26.770 --> 36:29.314
- On a scale of one to 100?
- One to two.

keep the goats in--good luck.

37:02.305 --> 37:04.015
- Adorable.
- Very cute.

37:04.057 --> 37:05.934

this is just stunning.

37:05.975 --> 37:08.436
I mean, really,
the intricate detail--

37:08.478 --> 37:10.855
The only thing
is, like, the window,

37:10.897 --> 37:12.190
just a little crooked.

37:12.232 --> 37:13.650
Just a little.

really outstanding.

37:17.821 --> 37:19.322
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

37:19.364 --> 37:22.242
- So we made the goats
out of speculoos cookie,

37:22.283 --> 37:24.077
which is like
a gingerbread-style cookie

37:24.119 --> 37:26.037

37:26.079 --> 37:27.914
I like the cookie.
- Thank you.

37:27.956 --> 37:30.417
- It's crispy,
but it's not real crispy--

37:30.458 --> 37:31.626
so hard that, you know...
- Can't bite through it.

37:31.668 --> 37:33.420
- You could break your teeth
on it, tight.

37:33.461 --> 37:36.006
- It was an explosion
in my mouth.

37:36.047 --> 37:38.758
This is the kind
of gingerbread cookie I want.

I know. I know.
I know it doesn't make sense.

37:46.057 --> 37:48.101
I know it.
I like the texture of it.

37:48.143 --> 37:49.394
It's just a little
too sweet for me.

37:49.436 --> 37:51.312
Maybe it's the icing.
- 'Cause you're so sweet.

37:51.354 --> 37:53.648

Well, I get enough sugar.

37:53.690 --> 37:55.275

wasn't my favorite.
