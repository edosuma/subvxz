- [Sadie Voiceover] Hey Dad,

00:16.233 --> 00:19.019
not much to report.
[somber guitar music]

00:19.106 --> 00:20.542
Francis found some
old bullet shells

00:20.629 --> 00:22.413
in the junkyard last week.

00:22.500 --> 00:26.026
But, I couldn't tell how old
or what kinda gun or anything.

00:27.810 --> 00:29.464
I wish you were here,

00:29.551 --> 00:30.987
you'd know for sure.

00:31.074 --> 00:34.208
[somber guitar music]

00:35.383 --> 00:37.559
The news said we were
scaling back troops.

00:39.082 --> 00:41.911
Do you think you'll be able
to come home for good soon?

00:41.998 --> 00:44.131
Last time it felt like
you were barely here.

00:45.610 --> 00:48.352
Or next time you're back
at base I could visit you?

00:48.439 --> 00:49.223
Maybe?

00:50.441 --> 00:51.964
I'd probably fit
in better there.

00:53.575 --> 00:55.577
Anyway, I guess that's it.

00:57.318 --> 00:59.059
I'll try to do something
exciting this week

00:59.146 --> 01:01.278
so I can tell you about
it in my next letter.

01:02.758 --> 01:04.019
I miss you a lot, Dad.

01:05.021 --> 01:06.327
But, you already know that.

01:08.677 --> 01:09.504
Sadie.

01:13.377 --> 01:17.120
[distant train horn blowing]

01:21.559 --> 01:23.083

01:23.170 --> 01:25.346
- Ha!
[screaming]

01:25.433 --> 01:26.738
- [Francis] Get off!

01:26.825 --> 01:27.652
Come on!

01:33.919 --> 01:34.746
- Francis?

01:36.096 --> 01:37.053
- [Francis] What?

01:37.140 --> 01:38.272
- Did you just get a boner?

01:42.276 --> 01:44.016
It's okay if you did.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.017
I mean, it's nature.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.671
- Sadie!

01:46.758 --> 01:49.065
I'm just saying it's fine,
don't be embarrassed.

01:49.152 --> 01:51.415
- Easy for you to say.

01:51.502 --> 01:53.025
- Fine.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.549
Be embarrassed about your boner.

02:25.057 --> 02:25.841
- [Sadie] Hey.

02:25.928 --> 02:26.755
- Hey.

02:29.801 --> 02:30.628
- Who's that?

02:32.543 --> 02:33.370
- That's, uh,

02:34.458 --> 02:35.764
what'd you say your name was?

02:37.722 --> 02:39.159
- Cyrus.

02:39.246 --> 02:40.160
- That's Cyrus.

02:41.117 --> 02:42.640
- What's his deal?

02:42.727 --> 02:44.033
- [Deak] His deal?

02:44.120 --> 02:45.817
What the hell is that?

02:45.904 --> 02:46.992
- His deal.

02:47.079 --> 02:47.819
What's his story?

02:47.906 --> 02:48.733
Why's he here?

02:50.344 --> 02:51.171
- Oh.

02:52.302 --> 02:53.173
What's your deal?

02:59.266 --> 03:02.182
She tells me that's some kind
of way to ask why you're here.

03:04.314 --> 03:05.533
- [Cyrus] Fuck if I know.

03:09.667 --> 03:10.494
Sorry.

03:12.322 --> 03:13.149
- What?

03:14.498 --> 03:15.717
You can say "fuck"
if you want to.

03:17.458 --> 03:18.676
- Oh yeah?

03:18.763 --> 03:19.590
- I don't care.

03:20.722 --> 03:22.202
- Well, okay then, good to know.

03:23.725 --> 03:25.030
- What's your dog's name?

03:26.249 --> 03:27.294
- Oh.

03:27.381 --> 03:28.817
That lump of fur is Benny.

03:30.079 --> 03:31.820
- Like Benjamin?

03:31.907 --> 03:34.214
- Well, we never really had
that formal of a relationship,

03:34.301 --> 03:36.390
so we just kinda
went with Benny.

03:36.477 --> 03:37.913
She hasn't corrected me yet.

03:38.914 --> 03:39.654
[trailer door creaking]

03:39.741 --> 03:40.959
- I'm Deak.

03:41.046 --> 03:41.873
This is Sadie.

03:42.918 --> 03:44.136
So, are you from here?

03:44.224 --> 03:45.050
- [Cyrus] Nope.

03:45.921 --> 03:47.314
- What brought you?

03:47.401 --> 03:48.663
- Job.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.055
Used to be a pilot.

03:50.142 --> 03:51.318
- Cool.

03:51.405 --> 03:52.362
- [Deak] Used to be?

03:55.017 --> 03:56.888
- [Francis] What do you do now?

03:56.975 --> 03:58.499
- Mechanic.

03:58.586 --> 04:00.283
Anyway, I'm sure we'll
be seeing each other.

04:00.370 --> 04:02.503
Good to know you Deak, Sadie.

04:02.590 --> 04:03.330
And you too.

04:03.417 --> 04:04.461
- Francis.

04:04.548 --> 04:05.462
- You too, Francis.

04:08.422 --> 04:10.162
- [Francis] He's awesome.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.513
- Just because he was a pilot
doesn't make him awesome.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.341
- [Francis] Yes it does.

04:14.428 --> 04:16.603
- Think you're entitled
to become an old coot

04:16.690 --> 04:17.779
at the ripe age of 13?

04:21.043 --> 04:21.870
- What's a coot?

04:23.263 --> 04:24.089
- I'm a coot.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.547
- [Bradley] Hey Sadie!

04:46.634 --> 04:47.896
How's it going?

04:47.983 --> 04:49.332
- [Cyrus] She's not home yet.

04:49.419 --> 04:51.203
- Oh yeah, I know.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.857
She's held up at the hospital,
I told her I'd wait for her.

04:59.821 --> 05:01.779
- So you wanna come
in or something?

05:01.866 --> 05:02.911
- Oh, that'd be great.

05:02.998 --> 05:04.739
If that's all right.

05:04.826 --> 05:05.653
Thanks.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.138
Thank you.

05:22.365 --> 05:24.541
Hey, so did you
like any of those,

05:24.628 --> 05:27.805
any of those clothes from
that box that I brought?

05:27.892 --> 05:30.112
- Um, some of them.

05:30.199 --> 05:32.506
- Yeah, I guess it's
not really your style.

05:32.593 --> 05:34.246
- I'm not really into pink.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.074
- [Bradley] Oh.

05:36.161 --> 05:37.859
My daughter loved
pink at your age.

05:38.990 --> 05:40.296
Oh, is that from your dad?

05:48.522 --> 05:50.262
How's he, how's
he doing, anyways?

05:57.139 --> 05:59.402
[sighing]

05:59.489 --> 06:01.230
- Well, I guess he's doing okay

06:01.317 --> 06:03.493
considering you're over here
trying to sleep with his wife

06:03.580 --> 06:05.234
while he's defending
our country.

06:06.148 --> 06:07.149
- Oh.

06:07.236 --> 06:08.368
Sadie, I'm not,

06:09.281 --> 06:10.631
I mean, me and your mom are--

06:10.718 --> 06:12.502
- [Sadie] Only because
she won't let you.

06:14.286 --> 06:15.113
- Wow.

06:16.898 --> 06:17.638
Hey.

06:17.725 --> 06:18.508
- [Rae] Oh.

06:18.595 --> 06:19.466
- How's it going?

06:19.553 --> 06:21.206
- Hi, good.

06:21.293 --> 06:23.948
Actually, would you help me
with the rest of the bags?

06:24.035 --> 06:25.123
- [Bradley] Yeah.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.736
- How long has he been here?

06:30.433 --> 06:31.260
- Few minutes.

06:33.262 --> 06:36.178
- Sorry babe, we're
just going to a movie.

06:41.836 --> 06:43.881
- Oh, looks like
you got the staples.

06:43.968 --> 06:44.969
- Yes.

06:45.056 --> 06:46.493
- Bread, milk and ba-na-nas.

06:50.801 --> 06:53.413
[somber music]

06:58.461 --> 06:59.854
- [Sadie] Come on, Francis.

07:08.558 --> 07:09.864
- Can you turn up the heat?

07:11.300 --> 07:13.955
- Francis, I'm
sorry, it's broken.

07:20.135 --> 07:21.789
I saw the letter from your dad.

07:25.314 --> 07:28.273
You know, I thought he'd be
coming home this time too.

07:33.061 --> 07:35.063
- You don't have to
act like you're sad.

07:35.150 --> 07:36.238
I know you don't care.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.632
- I care, Sadie.

07:39.633 --> 07:40.460
- Whatever.

07:42.897 --> 07:45.334
- You know what, I'm not
asking him to stay over there.

07:45.421 --> 07:47.205
He's deciding to do that.

07:50.078 --> 07:51.993
Maybe we both need
to think about that.

07:58.173 --> 07:59.870
I shouldn't have said that.

07:59.957 --> 08:00.741
I'm sorry.

08:02.046 --> 08:03.134
Okay, I'm sorry!

08:04.440 --> 08:05.267
Sadie?

08:07.008 --> 08:10.098
[bell ringing]

08:10.185 --> 08:11.360
- Bye, Mrs. Steves!

08:15.538 --> 08:18.019
- [Mr. Lee] These reports
show a dismal lack

08:18.106 --> 08:19.890
of information retention.

08:21.544 --> 08:23.546
We'll be working on this
over the next few weeks

08:23.633 --> 08:26.201
as I highlight methods for your

08:27.637 --> 08:28.812
future reports.

08:28.899 --> 08:31.511
[bell ringing]

08:34.251 --> 08:37.125
- It's like no one's
even paying attention.

08:37.212 --> 08:39.039
They just decide who you are

08:39.126 --> 08:41.607
and then just give you
that one grade forever

08:41.695 --> 08:44.741
so they don't even have
to act like they care.

08:46.221 --> 08:48.397
I don't even get why they're
teachers in the first place.

08:48.484 --> 08:50.660
- Well, Sadie, when
you figure out people,

08:51.574 --> 08:52.923
you be sure to let me know.

08:57.406 --> 08:59.495
- How do you get the
eyes to look so good?

09:01.149 --> 09:02.933
- What else do I
have to do all day?

09:07.590 --> 09:09.374
Is that supposed
to be our neighbor?

09:10.941 --> 09:11.768
- No.

09:13.291 --> 09:14.989
It's just a person.

09:15.076 --> 09:16.730
- No such thing
as just a person.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.080
Everybody's got details.

09:19.167 --> 09:21.561
You gotta know 'em to carve 'em.

09:21.648 --> 09:22.997
- Honestly, Sadie.

09:23.084 --> 09:24.128
I don't know what you
find to talk about

09:24.215 --> 09:25.521
with an old guy like him.

09:25.608 --> 09:27.001
- Don't you think you're a bit

09:27.088 --> 09:28.611
long in the tooth for
that kind of get up?

09:28.698 --> 09:30.352
- Do I have to remind you

09:30.439 --> 09:32.833
that my tips pay for
your room and board?

09:32.920 --> 09:33.964
- They're pity tips!

09:34.051 --> 09:34.878
- Oh, whatever.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.099
Does he harass you too?

09:39.622 --> 09:41.363
- [Cyrus] No, not too bad.

09:41.450 --> 09:42.843
- [Carla] I'm Carla.

09:42.930 --> 09:44.192
- I'm Cyrus.

09:44.279 --> 09:45.672
- [Carla] Cyrus,
nice to meet you.

09:45.759 --> 09:47.369
- You too.

09:47.456 --> 09:49.066
- [Carla] I work at this
bar, Chen's, up the road.

09:49.153 --> 09:50.372
You should stop by sometime

09:50.459 --> 09:52.766
and I'll buy you a shot.

09:52.853 --> 09:53.984
- I have to take you up on that.

09:54.071 --> 09:55.377
- [Carla] All right.

09:55.464 --> 09:57.335
- You can stop sucking it in.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.164
- I love you too, dad.

10:00.251 --> 10:02.514
[laughing]

10:13.656 --> 10:14.788
- I'd keep it simpler.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.661
Frogs, squirrels and whatnot.

10:20.924 --> 10:22.012
Men are tough.

10:24.580 --> 10:27.365
I'd give it a little more
time before starting on them.

10:34.242 --> 10:36.810
[somber music]

10:48.473 --> 10:51.085
- Hey, I'm going
out tonight, babe.

10:51.172 --> 10:51.955
- With Bradley?

10:53.870 --> 10:54.828
- Uh, no.

10:56.177 --> 10:57.308
Not with Bradley.

10:59.963 --> 11:01.748
Just keeping Carla company.

11:05.403 --> 11:06.535
Are you gonna be okay?

11:07.449 --> 11:08.276
- [Sadie] Hmm.

11:09.930 --> 11:12.628
[sighing]

11:12.715 --> 11:14.456
- Hey, about what I
said this morning.

11:14.543 --> 11:17.894
I don't want you thinking that
your dad doesn't miss you.

11:17.981 --> 11:21.593
I know that he thinks
about you all the time.

11:29.776 --> 11:30.559
Okay.

11:32.604 --> 11:34.171
[somber beat music]

11:34.258 --> 11:37.609
I can't hear again that
he's gonna stay over there.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.961
I'm just, it's driving me crazy.

11:41.048 --> 11:42.789
It's making me
crazy at this point.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.312
- Okay, let me stop
you right there.

11:44.399 --> 11:47.141
I don't think you owe
that man another day.

11:47.228 --> 11:48.795
Much less another year, okay?

11:48.882 --> 11:51.145
You put your whole life on hold.

11:51.232 --> 11:53.887
And I know for damn sure
he ain't saving his self

11:53.974 --> 11:56.150
this whole time!

11:56.237 --> 11:57.804
Look, I know you don't
like to hear that, Rae.

11:57.891 --> 11:59.109
But come on, face facts.

12:01.938 --> 12:04.680
Maybe it's time

12:04.767 --> 12:06.638
for you to give
it up to Bradley.

12:08.989 --> 12:10.251
[laughing]

12:10.338 --> 12:12.819
See, this is the
problem, right here

12:12.906 --> 12:14.951
I don't understand why
you're leading him on

12:15.038 --> 12:16.779
if this is how you
feel about him.

12:16.866 --> 12:19.173
- I'm still married, Carla.
[phone ringing]

12:19.260 --> 12:21.828
- I've been hearing you
say that for four years.

12:21.915 --> 12:23.090
I mean, come on.

12:24.308 --> 12:26.354
[phone ringing]

12:26.441 --> 12:27.268
Chen's.

12:28.922 --> 12:30.445
Oh hey, Jake.

12:33.535 --> 12:35.406
Oh, come on, seriously?

12:36.407 --> 12:37.626
No, no, it's fine.

12:37.713 --> 12:39.323
But you should know
you're probably

12:39.410 --> 12:42.109
about the most unreliable
asshole I've ever dated.

12:42.196 --> 12:44.415
And that's a pretty
serious lineup of dudes

12:44.502 --> 12:45.939
we're talking about here.

12:47.810 --> 12:49.943
Come on, like, this is
like the second time

12:50.030 --> 12:51.118
already that you've.

12:52.510 --> 12:53.468
You know what, it's fine.

12:53.555 --> 12:54.730
You just stay at work.

12:54.817 --> 12:55.644
I'll talk to you later.

12:55.731 --> 12:56.514
All right, bye.

12:57.951 --> 12:59.213
- [Carla] Hey!
- [Cyrus] Hey.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.215
- So, you decided
to show up, huh?

13:01.302 --> 13:03.217
Are you here for that
shot I promised you?

13:03.304 --> 13:04.044
- Yes, I am.

13:04.131 --> 13:05.436
- Alright.

13:05.523 --> 13:07.569
You know, this is
your neighbor, right?

13:07.656 --> 13:09.876
Rae, Cyrus, Cyrus, Rae.

13:09.963 --> 13:11.878
- Hi, hello, hi.

13:11.965 --> 13:12.792
- Hello.

13:17.013 --> 13:20.582
- [Carla] You seem like
a whiskey man, Cyrus

13:20.669 --> 13:22.366
- [Cyrus] You have me pegged.

13:22.453 --> 13:24.064
- [Carla] Don't I wish.

13:24.151 --> 13:26.240
- [Cyrus] To neighbors
getting neighborly.

13:28.068 --> 13:30.331
[laughing]

13:31.723 --> 13:34.074
Yeah, let's do that again.

13:34.161 --> 13:35.815
- [Carla] All right.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.168
[somber music]

13:56.226 --> 13:57.271
- [Sadie Voiceover] Hey, Dad.

13:57.358 --> 13:58.663
Got your letter.

14:00.361 --> 14:02.624
I'm disappointed,
but I understand.

14:04.017 --> 14:07.063
I guess you still have more
stuff you need to do over there.

14:07.150 --> 14:09.892
I kinda wish I
could just be there.

14:09.979 --> 14:12.721
That probably sounds
weird, but I don't know.

14:12.808 --> 14:14.592
I guess it just
seems more exciting.

14:16.420 --> 14:18.292
I just don't think anyone
here thinks about things

14:18.379 --> 14:19.380
the way we do.

14:21.251 --> 14:23.645
Everyone gets distracted
by the dumbest stuff.

14:26.604 --> 14:27.431
Whatever.

14:28.650 --> 14:29.912
I think adults just get nervous

14:29.999 --> 14:31.783
when kids are smarter
than they are.

14:35.222 --> 14:36.876
Okay, I should go to bed.

14:38.965 --> 14:39.748
I miss you.

14:41.402 --> 14:42.229
Sadie.

14:43.230 --> 14:46.494
[Cyrus laughing]

14:46.581 --> 14:49.192
[somber beat music]

14:49.279 --> 14:50.541
- [Cyrus] They joined
the mile-high club

14:50.628 --> 14:51.891
in the back of my plane.

14:51.978 --> 14:54.328
- And you didn't,
like, get in on it?

14:54.415 --> 14:55.155
- [Cyrus] What?

14:55.242 --> 14:56.286
Get in on it?

14:56.373 --> 14:57.635
- [Rae] He's flying the plane.

14:57.722 --> 14:58.332
- [Cyrus] I had
to fly the plane.

14:58.419 --> 15:00.073
[laughing]

15:00.160 --> 15:01.726
- You guys good over there?

15:01.813 --> 15:03.424
- Oh, it's nice
to be remembered.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.208
- Oh, hush Jimmy,
what do you need?

15:05.295 --> 15:07.167
- What I need is a
waitress who thinks about

15:07.254 --> 15:09.517
filling up my drink every
once in a while, huh?

15:09.604 --> 15:11.998
- You know what? I
will come to you,

15:12.085 --> 15:13.564
how 'bout that?

15:13.651 --> 15:15.044
- [Jimmy] When in
trouble, go for a double.

15:15.131 --> 15:16.480
- [Carla] Look, you
can rhyme all you want.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.569
But, I will pour you a double

15:18.656 --> 15:21.703
when you pay for
your tab on time.

15:21.790 --> 15:24.140
- [Jimmy] Don't get
technical with me, Carla.

15:24.227 --> 15:25.925
Money shouldn't
stand between us.

15:27.230 --> 15:28.362
- [Carla] You get me every time.

15:28.449 --> 15:31.321
[Jimmy laughing]

15:31.408 --> 15:32.235
- What?

15:35.021 --> 15:35.847
- Nothing.

15:37.675 --> 15:39.547
- [Carla] So, where were we?

15:43.290 --> 15:44.334
- Um.

15:44.421 --> 15:47.468
I think I'm just gonna head out.

15:47.555 --> 15:48.295
- [Carla] Really?

15:48.382 --> 15:49.905
- [Rae] Yeah.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.124
I'm just beat and I gotta
work in the morning.

15:54.649 --> 15:55.693
- That's probably a good idea.

15:55.780 --> 15:56.825
- You too?

15:56.912 --> 15:58.305
- [Cyrus] Thanks for the invite.

15:58.392 --> 15:59.697
- Thanks for coming.

16:00.568 --> 16:01.830
And I'll see y'all later.

16:01.917 --> 16:02.657
- [Rae] Love you.

16:02.744 --> 16:03.484
- Be safe.

16:03.571 --> 16:04.311
- [Rae] Thanks.

16:04.398 --> 16:06.052
- And behave.

16:06.139 --> 16:07.140
It's a school night.

16:17.933 --> 16:18.978
- Did you drive here?

16:20.153 --> 16:21.850
- I walked here.

16:21.937 --> 16:23.156
- Let me give you a ride.

16:24.592 --> 16:25.985
- It's just a few blocks.

16:27.334 --> 16:28.944
- We're both going the same way.

16:31.164 --> 16:32.165
- That's true.

16:32.252 --> 16:34.123
[giggling]

16:34.210 --> 16:37.257
I mean, you just had
a bunch of shots.

16:37.344 --> 16:38.998
I don't know if I should
be getting in the car

16:39.085 --> 16:41.391
with someone who's
been drinking.

16:42.523 --> 16:43.524
- Yeah.

16:44.873 --> 16:46.092
Well, that is a
very responsible way

16:46.179 --> 16:48.050
of looking at the situation.

16:48.137 --> 16:49.443
- That's me.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.625
You wanna walk me home?

16:57.712 --> 16:58.843
- Yeah, okay.

17:03.935 --> 17:06.025
Yeah, it's got character.

17:06.112 --> 17:07.026
I'll give you that.

17:09.332 --> 17:10.420
- This is me.

17:21.431 --> 17:22.345
- Well.

17:22.432 --> 17:25.479
- Yeah.
[giggling]

17:25.566 --> 17:26.393
So.

17:42.713 --> 17:44.889
[moaning]

17:47.109 --> 17:47.936
- I...

17:50.765 --> 17:51.766
I didn't shave.

17:55.683 --> 17:57.946
[laughing]

17:58.903 --> 18:00.296
- Shut the fuck up.

18:05.606 --> 18:08.783
[distant dog barking]

18:14.876 --> 18:16.051
Oh shit, I'm sorry.

18:18.140 --> 18:20.360
- [Rae] Oh yeah, right,
I have a daughter.

18:20.447 --> 18:21.883
- Found that out.

18:24.277 --> 18:25.060
[thudding]

18:25.147 --> 18:26.192
Jesus Christ,

18:26.279 --> 18:27.715
I just flashed my junk at a kid.

18:30.196 --> 18:31.022
Sadie, right?

18:32.372 --> 18:33.329
- You've met?

18:33.416 --> 18:34.765
- Briefly, yeah.

18:34.852 --> 18:37.942
[intense rock music]

18:41.685 --> 18:43.557
- [Teacher] For this
admiration paper,

18:43.644 --> 18:45.733
you should consider
this person's impact

18:45.820 --> 18:47.387
on your personal growth.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.954
Times New Roman, 12-point font.

18:50.041 --> 18:53.001
One-inch margins.
[bell rings]

18:57.788 --> 19:00.922
- Did you hear that Jesse
Durantz got suspended?

19:01.009 --> 19:04.186
I guess he was the one who did
that bomb threat yesterday.

19:04.273 --> 19:07.189
- I hate Mr. Lee's
stupid assignments.

19:07.276 --> 19:08.973
Think about how much more
interesting it would be

19:09.060 --> 19:12.020
if we wrote about somebody
we hate, like Jesse Durantz.

19:13.195 --> 19:15.241
He's beaten you up,
what, how many times?

19:15.328 --> 19:16.764
- Nine.

19:16.851 --> 19:18.940
- Yeah, so what would
you write about him?

19:20.289 --> 19:22.291
- I don't really know
anything about him.

19:23.510 --> 19:25.120
- But how do you feel about him?

19:27.253 --> 19:29.298
Oh, come on, Francis.

19:29.385 --> 19:30.386
You hate him.

19:35.522 --> 19:38.264
- I think he might come from
a broken home or something.

19:38.351 --> 19:39.874
- Don't make excuses for him.

19:41.223 --> 19:43.225
You don't even seem happy
that he's suspended.

19:43.312 --> 19:46.141
I mean, do you know
how risky that was?

19:46.228 --> 19:47.055
- What?

19:50.667 --> 19:52.278
- I took his cell phone
from his bag at lunch

19:52.365 --> 19:55.368
and put it back before he
ever even knew it was gone.

19:58.022 --> 20:00.111
They traced that bomb
threat right to him.

20:01.374 --> 20:03.898
- That's on his
permanent record!

20:03.985 --> 20:05.421
- Permanent record?

20:05.508 --> 20:07.336
We're kids, Francis.

20:07.423 --> 20:08.642
Nobody cares what we do.

20:11.384 --> 20:12.907
- Geez, you're welcome.

20:25.398 --> 20:27.051
- Hey, Sadie, what's up?

20:28.096 --> 20:29.097
How's your day going?

20:32.274 --> 20:33.101
Uh.

20:39.063 --> 20:41.240
[knocking]

20:42.893 --> 20:45.505
Hey, do you mind
if I wait inside?

20:48.856 --> 20:49.596
Yeah, thank you.

20:49.683 --> 20:50.466
Whew.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.556
Your mom said that
she'd go to this

20:53.643 --> 20:55.515
school board thing
with me tonight.

20:57.604 --> 20:59.214
I'll just sit right here.

20:59.301 --> 21:01.260
[Bradley groaning]

21:01.347 --> 21:04.001
[phone ringing]

21:06.134 --> 21:07.178
- Hello.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.919
- [Rae] Hey, Sadie, uh, listen.

21:09.006 --> 21:10.965
I wanted to let you know
that I'm bringing home pizza

21:11.052 --> 21:13.707
and Cyrus is coming
over to eat with us.

21:13.794 --> 21:17.363
So, we can both get to
know him a little better.

21:17.450 --> 21:18.973
- Okay.

21:19.060 --> 21:20.235
- [Rae] Oh, great.

21:20.322 --> 21:21.454
See you soon.

21:28.243 --> 21:29.766
- [Sadie] You want some coffee?

21:33.988 --> 21:35.555
- Wow, what service.

21:35.642 --> 21:36.469
Thank you.

21:37.861 --> 21:38.688
Hello.

21:40.081 --> 21:40.821
Hey.

21:40.908 --> 21:41.865
- Bradley,

21:41.952 --> 21:43.258
I saw your car.

21:43.345 --> 21:46.609
But I didn't know
you would be here.

21:47.480 --> 21:48.307
- Oh, really?

21:49.482 --> 21:51.614
We had our date tonight.

21:51.701 --> 21:52.659
Did you forget?

21:52.746 --> 21:54.835
Oh.
[laughing]

21:54.922 --> 21:56.532
You forgot?

21:56.619 --> 21:57.751
No worries.

21:57.838 --> 21:58.795
- I'm so sorry.

21:58.882 --> 22:00.667
- It's fine, we all forget.

22:00.754 --> 22:01.581
- I just,

22:01.668 --> 22:03.583
you know, tonight is

22:04.845 --> 22:06.673
not good as it turns out.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.239
- Yeah, it's fine,
it's no biggie.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.197
- [Rae] I'm sorry.

22:09.284 --> 22:10.677
- No, please, it's fine.

22:11.895 --> 22:15.595
- Can we maybe meet
for lunch tomorrow?

22:15.682 --> 22:16.987
- Yeah, lunch is great.

22:17.074 --> 22:18.249
Lunch would be great.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.207
- Okay,

22:19.294 --> 22:22.602
I think we should talk,

22:22.689 --> 22:23.429
have a talk.

22:23.516 --> 22:24.299
- Yeah.

22:24.386 --> 22:25.213
Great.

22:26.388 --> 22:27.215
All right.

22:29.435 --> 22:30.174
All right, I'll see you late.

22:30.261 --> 22:31.088
- Okay.

22:33.526 --> 22:34.353
- Hey.

22:35.571 --> 22:36.355
- Oh.

22:36.442 --> 22:37.965
[chuckling]

22:38.052 --> 22:38.879
Hello.

22:38.966 --> 22:39.793
- [Cyrus] Hey.

22:42.143 --> 22:44.058
- All right, well.

22:44.145 --> 22:45.015
- [Rae] I'll call you soon.
- [Bradley] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:45.102 --> 22:46.887
- Yeah, yeah.

22:46.974 --> 22:47.975
- Have a good night.

22:53.241 --> 22:55.243
Who was that guy?

22:55.330 --> 22:57.114
- [Rae] Just a friend.

22:58.333 --> 22:59.682
- [Cyrus] Does he know that?

23:00.901 --> 23:02.424
- He does now, I guess.

23:02.511 --> 23:04.165
[chuckling]

23:04.252 --> 23:07.168
- Yeah, it looked like he
might be in love with you.

23:07.255 --> 23:09.344
- Yeah, he's not
in love with me.

23:10.737 --> 23:14.480
We were just not
being alone together.

23:19.180 --> 23:22.009
[plates clinking]

23:24.272 --> 23:26.274
Sadie, come have some pizza!

23:30.234 --> 23:31.018
[knocking]

23:31.105 --> 23:31.932
Sadie?

23:40.593 --> 23:41.724
Guess she's mad at me.

23:43.770 --> 23:44.640
- Maybe I should go.

23:44.727 --> 23:46.033
- [Rae] No, no, don't.

23:46.120 --> 23:46.947
Stay.

23:47.034 --> 23:48.339
She's fine.

23:48.427 --> 23:49.166
- Yeah?

23:49.253 --> 23:50.124
- Yeah.

23:50.211 --> 23:51.430
Do you want a beer?

23:51.517 --> 23:53.823
- [Cyrus] Yeah, sure.
- [Rae] Yeah.

23:53.910 --> 23:55.042
- [Rae] Yeah.

23:55.129 --> 23:57.261
- Thanks.
[laughing]

24:01.396 --> 24:03.224
So you lived here long?

24:03.311 --> 24:04.791
- Yeah, you could say that.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.446
11 years.

24:07.533 --> 24:08.838
- Oh, Jesus.

24:08.925 --> 24:10.057
Okay, that's pretty long.

24:10.144 --> 24:12.189
[chuckling]

24:12.276 --> 24:13.016
Thanks.

24:13.103 --> 24:13.930
- Yeah.

24:15.802 --> 24:16.977
I don't know, you think,

24:19.501 --> 24:24.245
you'll grow up and you'll have
a house and have a yard and--

24:24.332 --> 24:25.594
- Hmmm.

24:25.681 --> 24:26.987
- You know, but it's good too.

24:27.074 --> 24:30.294
I mean, we know everyone
around at least.

24:31.252 --> 24:32.906
Couple I wish I didn't.

24:32.993 --> 24:35.343
[chuckling]

24:36.518 --> 24:38.477
Carla and I have known
each other forever.

24:39.913 --> 24:42.393
And, you know, Francis
and Sadie are inseparable.

24:43.830 --> 24:46.485
So, it's not tragic.

24:49.575 --> 24:50.401
- That's nice.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.015
- Where did you move here from?

24:55.885 --> 24:57.191
- [Cyrus] Just across town.

25:00.237 --> 25:03.589
- Just looking for
a change of scenery?

25:03.676 --> 25:04.938
- Yeah.

25:05.025 --> 25:06.330
Yeah, something like that.

25:06.417 --> 25:08.724
[chuckling]

25:10.813 --> 25:12.641
- It's a pretty sad view.

25:18.038 --> 25:19.648
- I think it's all right.

25:26.829 --> 25:29.092
[knocking]

25:42.715 --> 25:43.542
- Hey.

25:47.458 --> 25:48.285
Can we talk?

25:50.244 --> 25:52.072
- I don't wanna
talk with him here.

25:52.159 --> 25:53.464
- Cyrus went home.

25:57.730 --> 25:58.557
Sadie,

26:00.384 --> 26:01.690
did you know I haven't gotten

26:01.777 --> 26:03.562
a letter from your
dad in three years?

26:05.041 --> 26:06.608
- He writes every other week.

26:10.133 --> 26:12.092
- He writes to you
every other week.

26:17.271 --> 26:18.707
He loves you a lot, babe.

26:19.839 --> 26:21.057
He just got over me.

26:24.234 --> 26:29.239
- Well, maybe the letters are
supposed to be to both of us.

26:41.948 --> 26:42.818
- Scoot over.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.309
[somber guitar music]

26:55.396 --> 26:57.180
- [Sadie Voiceover] Hey Dad.

26:57.267 --> 26:59.052
I wrote a paper for class
where I tried to imagine

26:59.139 --> 27:00.706
my life as a soldier with you.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.099
Mr. Lee will probably hate it.

27:04.492 --> 27:05.798
Teachers can't
handle violent stuff,

27:05.885 --> 27:08.278
even though it's
literally everywhere.

27:08.365 --> 27:10.193
I mean, Francis gets
messed with all the time

27:10.280 --> 27:12.065
and he deserves it
less than anyone.

27:13.501 --> 27:15.285
Luckily Francis has me,
and I learned from the best

27:15.372 --> 27:18.245
so we don't need some dumb
teacher to solve our problems.

27:18.332 --> 27:20.290
Seriously, adults
can be so pointless.

27:21.727 --> 27:23.642
Oh, by the way, Mom and I
talked about you last night

27:23.729 --> 27:26.775
and she said she
misses you so much.

27:26.862 --> 27:28.255
I know she wishes
you'd write to her

27:28.342 --> 27:30.387
as much as you write to me.
[bell ringing]

27:30.474 --> 27:33.347
Maybe send something for her
the next time you write, okay?

27:34.217 --> 27:35.479
Miss you.

27:35.566 --> 27:37.177
Sadie.

27:37.264 --> 27:39.005
- [Mr. Lee] Leave your
admiration papers on my desk.

27:40.746 --> 27:43.357
[somber music]

27:57.763 --> 27:58.677
- [Francis] Ready?

27:59.634 --> 28:00.679
[sighing]

28:00.766 --> 28:01.549
- Yeah.

28:04.291 --> 28:05.596
- Let's go out the back way.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.903
- Oh, don't worry
about it, Francis.

28:07.990 --> 28:09.339
He won't even notice you.

28:10.776 --> 28:13.343
[somber music]

28:18.435 --> 28:19.523
[phone ringing]

28:19.610 --> 28:20.829
- Pops, could you get that?

28:20.916 --> 28:22.701
- You can ogle
Cyrus from inside.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.180
Whatcha think windows are for?

28:24.267 --> 28:26.922
[phone ringing]

28:30.230 --> 28:31.448
- Sorry!

28:31.535 --> 28:32.536
I would have got it,

28:33.755 --> 28:34.800
but ours are in there.

28:36.453 --> 28:39.108
[phone ringing]

28:40.109 --> 28:40.936
Sir.

28:41.894 --> 28:42.895
- Thank you.

28:46.420 --> 28:47.203
- Coffee?

28:47.290 --> 28:48.596
- [Cyrus] Thanks.

28:48.683 --> 28:49.640
Do you mind holding
on to it for a sec?

28:49.728 --> 28:50.990
- No, keeps my hands warm.

28:52.905 --> 28:54.689
Did you figure out what
was making that noise?

28:54.776 --> 28:56.909
- [Cyrus] You should have had
this looked at a while ago.

28:56.996 --> 28:58.737
The hose was practically
burned through.

28:58.824 --> 28:59.563
- [Rae] Oh, really?

28:59.650 --> 29:01.522
- [Cyrus] Yeah.

29:01.609 --> 29:03.437
- [Deak] Who was it?

29:03.524 --> 29:05.004
- [Carla] Jake.

29:05.091 --> 29:07.136
- You tell him to bring
that moonshine tonight?

29:07.223 --> 29:08.355
- He can't make it.

29:08.442 --> 29:10.313
He gotta work.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.751
- That boy should be a billionaire
amount of time he works.

29:14.230 --> 29:15.841
- You wanna go out tonight?

29:15.928 --> 29:17.843
- Sadie's making us dinner.

29:17.930 --> 29:20.149
- Right, that's right.

29:20.236 --> 29:22.021
Must have asked real nice
to get her to cook for me.

29:22.108 --> 29:24.545
- It was her idea, if
you can believe it.

29:24.632 --> 29:25.546
- [Carla] Hey, Rae!

29:26.547 --> 29:27.548
Let's go inside.

29:27.635 --> 29:28.636
It's cold as shit.

29:30.159 --> 29:30.986
- Okay.

29:32.118 --> 29:32.858
Okay.

29:32.945 --> 29:33.728
- See ya.

29:33.815 --> 29:34.598
- Thank you.

29:34.685 --> 29:36.035
- You're welcome.

29:37.297 --> 29:38.124
Ow.

29:39.473 --> 29:40.561
- [Francis] Why
don't you like Cyrus?

29:40.648 --> 29:41.823
I think he's nice.

29:43.129 --> 29:44.565
- He's not.

29:44.652 --> 29:45.522
- How do you know?

29:47.481 --> 29:50.136
- Nice people don't
break up families.

29:50.223 --> 29:52.791
- Well he fixed Grandpa's radio.

29:53.966 --> 29:56.142
- You're right, Francis,
that changes everything.

29:57.926 --> 29:59.580
- [Francis] I don't get
why you're cooking for him

29:59.667 --> 30:01.669
if you don't even like him.

30:01.756 --> 30:05.064
- [Sadie] Don't worry
about it, Francis.

30:35.311 --> 30:36.573
- Do you know that bastard

30:36.660 --> 30:39.576
stood me up three
times this week?

30:40.795 --> 30:43.102
- He's, you know how
I feel about him.

30:43.189 --> 30:44.059
- [Carla] I know.

30:44.146 --> 30:44.930
- He's not.

30:45.017 --> 30:47.280
[chuckling]

30:50.892 --> 30:55.114
Cyrus must be doing some
good things to that body

30:55.201 --> 30:57.681
because it's buzzing.
[phone ringing]

30:57.768 --> 30:58.769
[laughing]

30:58.857 --> 31:00.423
I can practically hear it.

31:01.947 --> 31:03.035
Hello?

31:03.122 --> 31:04.297
Yeah, Sadie, I'll tell her.

31:04.384 --> 31:05.864
All right.

31:05.951 --> 31:06.777
Dinner's ready.

31:09.041 --> 31:09.868
- [Cyrus] Yeah.

31:13.219 --> 31:14.046
- [Randall] You didn't
short me now, did ya?

31:14.133 --> 31:15.569
Wanna count this?

31:16.570 --> 31:17.876
- Hey.

31:17.963 --> 31:19.616
Come on over here
and meet my brother.

31:21.967 --> 31:22.793
- Oh.

31:25.579 --> 31:27.015
Hi.

31:27.102 --> 31:28.930
- [Randall] So this is Rae.

31:29.017 --> 31:29.931
- This is Randall.

31:30.932 --> 31:33.108
And this here's Kritch.

31:33.195 --> 31:34.066
- Hey, guys.

31:36.459 --> 31:38.418
So Sadie has dinner ready.

31:38.505 --> 31:40.637
- You really got girls
cooking you dinner?

31:40.724 --> 31:41.464
So what're you bitching about?

31:41.551 --> 31:42.988
- Hey, fuck off.

31:43.075 --> 31:44.467
- Oh, fuck off?

31:44.554 --> 31:45.077
- [Cyrus] Yeah, dude.
- [Randall] Fuck off?

31:45.164 --> 31:46.295
- Yeah.

31:46.382 --> 31:48.123
[groaning]
- Don't worry, Rae.

31:48.210 --> 31:49.646
He steps out of line, you just
gotta show him who's boss.

31:49.733 --> 31:50.821
[groaning]

31:50.909 --> 31:54.738
- Dammit, Randall! Stop it!

31:54.825 --> 31:56.218
Such a fucking asshole.

31:57.263 --> 31:58.351
- Barely touched you.

31:59.482 --> 32:00.875
Come on, let's get out of here.

32:00.962 --> 32:01.745
Good to meet you, Rae.

32:01.832 --> 32:02.790
- Good to meet you.

32:02.877 --> 32:03.704
Oh.

32:05.314 --> 32:06.576
Bye, guys.

32:06.663 --> 32:07.795
- [Randall] I'll
never forget this.

32:08.839 --> 32:09.579
- Asshole.

32:09.666 --> 32:10.450
- Are you okay?

32:10.537 --> 32:11.233
- Yeah, I'm fine.

32:11.320 --> 32:12.278
I'm good.

32:14.367 --> 32:15.107
- Okay.

32:15.194 --> 32:16.021
- Dinner, yeah?

32:16.108 --> 32:16.891
- Yeah, you wanna?

32:16.978 --> 32:17.805
- Yeah.

32:18.632 --> 32:19.894
I'm starving.

32:19.981 --> 32:22.636
- What kind of name
is Kritch anyway?

32:26.335 --> 32:27.162
Oh.

32:28.511 --> 32:29.904
Smells amazing in here.

32:39.783 --> 32:41.960
- My back is giving me
some trouble tonight.

32:43.265 --> 32:44.092
- How come?

32:45.485 --> 32:46.965
- [Cyrus] I tweaked it a bit.

32:48.488 --> 32:49.445
- I already poured milk.

32:49.532 --> 32:50.881
- We're gonna have a beer.

32:56.887 --> 32:57.758
Oh, actually.

32:57.845 --> 33:00.195
Do you want some water?

33:00.282 --> 33:01.588
- Water?

33:01.675 --> 33:02.676
- [Rae] Yeah, it's
probably not good

33:02.763 --> 33:04.634
to mix beer with your pills.

33:04.721 --> 33:06.158
- Oh, no, nah, it's fine.

33:09.030 --> 33:10.771
- You could take
them with your milk.

33:12.642 --> 33:16.037
- I don't remember the last
time I drank straight milk.

33:16.124 --> 33:17.212
That's pretty hardcore.

33:21.869 --> 33:22.696
- Mmmm.

33:24.393 --> 33:26.004
This is so good, Sadie.

33:27.309 --> 33:28.789
- [Cyrus] Where's
the ground beef?

33:30.051 --> 33:31.618
- [Rae] Sadie doesn't eat meat.

33:32.836 --> 33:33.794
- Oh yeah?

33:33.881 --> 33:34.708
How come?

33:37.189 --> 33:38.016
- It's weird.

33:39.756 --> 33:40.757
- [Cyrus] Weird how?

33:43.325 --> 33:44.631
- Like, you wouldn't
go up to your dog

33:44.718 --> 33:46.154
and start gnawing
on her leg, right?

33:46.241 --> 33:48.113
- Well, you'd get all
that hair in your mouth.

33:48.200 --> 33:51.072
- I mean, even if you skinned
it and cooked it, like a cow,

33:51.159 --> 33:52.813
it'd still be weird.

33:52.900 --> 33:54.206
- [Rae] Sadie.

33:54.293 --> 33:55.381
- It's just some
random decision made

33:55.468 --> 33:57.078
by some guy a long time ago

33:57.165 --> 33:59.646
that dogs would be pets
and cows would be dinner.

33:59.733 --> 34:02.475
- [Rae] Do we have to
talk about it though?

34:02.562 --> 34:04.303
- There's no dog or cow in here.

34:04.390 --> 34:06.131
This is tofu.

34:06.218 --> 34:07.610
- Tofu, where?

34:07.697 --> 34:09.786
- [Sadie] It's in the cheese.

34:09.873 --> 34:11.745
- How am I supposed
to pick it out then?

34:14.094 --> 34:16.141
[laughing]

34:16.228 --> 34:19.143
Oh, I'm just teasing, Sadie.

34:20.406 --> 34:22.886
And I can't argue with
your logic either.

34:22.973 --> 34:25.018
I would never eat
Benny, that's for sure.

34:31.156 --> 34:34.027
- Hey, do you think, maybe
you'd wanna come by the hospital

34:34.114 --> 34:36.509
and get your back
checked out sometime?

34:36.596 --> 34:38.946
I think I can get one of
the doctors to look at you.

34:39.033 --> 34:40.513
Like, as a favor.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.254
- Nah.

34:42.341 --> 34:44.864
I don't need a doctor to
tell me what I already know.

34:44.952 --> 34:45.909
- [Rae] Which is?

34:47.650 --> 34:49.652
- I landed on it wrong and
it is now forever fucked.

34:52.132 --> 34:54.527
Oh, it's cool, Sadie
said I could swear.

34:54.614 --> 34:55.876
- Oh, did she?

34:59.749 --> 35:03.753
So, you've never
had it looked at?

35:03.840 --> 35:06.016
- I did once, back
when it happened.

35:11.283 --> 35:12.980
- How do you get
your pills then?

35:15.504 --> 35:17.027
- My brother gets them for me.

35:19.421 --> 35:20.901
I know, I know.

35:23.469 --> 35:25.210
But it would cost
five times that much

35:25.297 --> 35:27.951
to go through the doctor for
'em and I can't afford that.

35:31.955 --> 35:34.436
- How's your brother get them
cheaper than the hospital?

35:41.661 --> 35:44.881
- You know what, I think
I need to go lay down.

35:44.968 --> 35:46.274
Sorry to eat and run.

35:47.493 --> 35:48.929
Thank you for dinner, Sadie.

35:53.934 --> 35:56.066
That was damn good for
some veggie lasagna.

36:02.029 --> 36:04.597
[somber music]

36:11.865 --> 36:13.127
[faucet running]

36:13.214 --> 36:15.085
- [Rae] You know, Sadie.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.827
It wouldn't kill you to
give people a chance.

36:21.048 --> 36:23.616
[somber music]

36:51.687 --> 36:53.907
[groaning]

37:07.399 --> 37:08.313
[knocking]

37:08.400 --> 37:09.923
- Yeah.

37:10.010 --> 37:10.837
Come on in.

37:12.142 --> 37:12.969
- Hi.

37:15.581 --> 37:17.235
I brought, in case.

37:18.671 --> 37:19.498
Oh, gosh.

37:20.934 --> 37:21.978
How's it feeling?

37:23.110 --> 37:25.243
- [Cyrus] Easing
up a little bit.

37:25.330 --> 37:26.722
- Is this okay?

37:26.809 --> 37:28.115
- Yeah, feels good.

37:29.116 --> 37:30.944
- I'm sorry she was.

37:32.206 --> 37:35.035
Takes her a minute
to warm up to people.

37:36.689 --> 37:39.257
- She's a teenager, she's allowed to be
a little bit ornery.

37:41.171 --> 37:42.695
- I guess she is a teenager.

37:46.351 --> 37:47.134
- Don't worry.

37:48.178 --> 37:49.441
Girl always needs her mama.

37:54.315 --> 37:55.273
- [Rae] How'd this happen?

37:55.360 --> 37:56.230
Your back.

37:59.146 --> 37:59.973
- Bar fight.

38:01.017 --> 38:02.062
- [Rae] Really?

38:02.149 --> 38:03.368
- Yeah.

38:03.455 --> 38:04.456
[chuckling]

38:04.543 --> 38:05.892
So stupid.

38:07.110 --> 38:10.070
- That's when you lost
your pilot's license?

38:10.157 --> 38:11.114
- [Cyrus] Yeah.

38:11.201 --> 38:12.638
Grounded me for six months.

38:16.990 --> 38:18.470
- How come you didn't go back?

38:20.210 --> 38:21.037
You must miss it.

38:24.824 --> 38:27.000
- If everybody got to
do what they loved,

38:27.087 --> 38:30.090
then there wouldn't be
any janitors or fry cooks

38:30.177 --> 38:33.789
and the world would just
be a big messy place

38:33.876 --> 38:35.313
without any fried food.

38:41.536 --> 38:44.060
- There's something
I should tell you

38:44.147 --> 38:46.585
that I haven't yet, because, um,

38:48.064 --> 38:48.978
I don't know why.

38:50.719 --> 38:51.503
I'm married.

38:53.461 --> 38:54.593
- Yeah,

38:54.680 --> 38:55.507
yeah, Carla said.

38:59.119 --> 39:00.076
- Carla told you?

39:01.426 --> 39:02.905
- She said he was
out of the picture.

39:05.691 --> 39:07.388
- Well, he's in the service.

39:07.475 --> 39:08.433
He's overseas.

39:10.260 --> 39:11.261
But yes, yeah,

39:11.349 --> 39:14.352
he's out of the picture.

39:18.704 --> 39:19.966
Is this even helping?

39:20.967 --> 39:21.794
- Yeah.

39:21.881 --> 39:22.708
That's nice.

39:27.277 --> 39:30.280
[train horn blowing]

39:30.368 --> 39:32.457
- [Francis] It's kind
of cold to be outside.

39:33.545 --> 39:35.808
- Be a man, Francis.

39:35.895 --> 39:37.549
- Plus, I have to pee.

39:38.419 --> 39:41.683
[train rails clanking]

39:51.737 --> 39:53.652
- Do you wanna try
kissing each other

39:53.739 --> 39:56.350
just to see what it's like?

39:56.437 --> 39:58.570
I think we'd both
learn something.

40:04.010 --> 40:04.837
- Okay.

40:13.106 --> 40:16.239
- Are you gonna kiss me
or should I kiss you?

40:16.326 --> 40:17.327
- What do you think?

40:19.982 --> 40:21.941
- Um, we could do it on three?

40:25.205 --> 40:26.032
- Okay.

40:28.600 --> 40:29.427
- One.

40:30.819 --> 40:31.646
Two.

40:36.608 --> 40:37.435
Three.

40:40.307 --> 40:42.440
[gasping]

40:43.528 --> 40:47.140
Huh.

40:47.227 --> 40:47.967
- Hmm.

40:57.629 --> 40:59.413
- Take this paper
to the counselor.

41:03.373 --> 41:04.636
- Why?

41:04.723 --> 41:06.420
- [Mr. Lee] Use the
pass by the door.

41:16.212 --> 41:17.779
- Hey, how's it going, Sadie?

41:18.650 --> 41:19.825
- [Sadie] Super.

41:21.870 --> 41:23.219
- Oh, yeah.

41:23.306 --> 41:26.571
Mr. Lee, he showed
me this this morning

41:26.658 --> 41:28.529
and I had a chance to read it.

41:29.748 --> 41:32.751
Oh it's, it's intense stuff

41:32.838 --> 41:36.406
and actually really
darn specific.

41:38.191 --> 41:38.974
Uh.

41:40.759 --> 41:43.239
I'm curious, does your dad,

41:43.326 --> 41:45.677
does he talk to you about
these kinds of things?

41:47.026 --> 41:49.594
- Most of that stuff
is just on the news.

41:49.681 --> 41:51.378
- Really?

41:51.465 --> 41:54.860
I personally have not seen
this kind of stuff on the news.

41:57.253 --> 41:59.734
You know why you're here, right?

41:59.821 --> 42:01.214
I mean.

42:01.301 --> 42:02.998
- Well, you probably
think that the paper

42:03.085 --> 42:06.959
is too violent and that a
girl shouldn't be writing

42:07.046 --> 42:08.656
about war and stuff.

42:08.743 --> 42:10.136
- Okay, come on, this is
not because you're a girl.

42:10.223 --> 42:11.659
This has nothing to do
with you being a girl.

42:11.746 --> 42:14.227
- Well, I'm sorry if it
was too much for you.

42:14.314 --> 42:15.054
[Bradley laughing]

42:15.141 --> 42:16.359
- Okay.

42:16.446 --> 42:19.798
Mr. Lee, he's
kinda hard to shock

42:19.885 --> 42:23.192
and he was, this was shocking.

42:23.279 --> 42:25.630
This was pretty alarming.

42:25.717 --> 42:27.457
And I feel like I
need to tell you,

42:27.545 --> 42:29.808
these horrors that
you're writing about,

42:29.895 --> 42:32.027
they've got extreme
consequences.

42:33.463 --> 42:36.815
And what your dad does,

42:36.902 --> 42:37.816
is,

42:37.903 --> 42:39.252
that's not a game.

42:39.339 --> 42:40.383
That's not a game.

42:42.908 --> 42:44.039
Do you understand that?

42:45.737 --> 42:49.044
- Have you ever served
your country, Bradley?

42:49.131 --> 42:50.829
- Okay, when we're at
school it's Mr. Capperchack,

42:50.916 --> 42:52.526
but, no, I have not.

42:52.613 --> 42:53.832
- Well,

42:53.919 --> 42:55.485
Bradley, then I
really don't think

42:55.573 --> 42:57.270
you know anything about it.

42:57.357 --> 42:59.664
- Maybe there's some different
things you can focus on,

42:59.751 --> 43:00.969
like um--

43:01.056 --> 43:02.014
- [Sadie] Like
boys and lipstick?

43:02.101 --> 43:03.798
And when I get my period?

43:03.885 --> 43:04.669
- That's not what I'm saying,
that's not what I'm saying.

43:04.756 --> 43:06.105
I mean, like--

43:06.192 --> 43:07.454
- Like how my mom is
cheating on my dad?

43:20.772 --> 43:21.599
- Okay.

43:28.083 --> 43:29.868
Mr. Lee needs you to
rewrite this paper

43:29.955 --> 43:31.783
and I need to back him up.

43:31.870 --> 43:33.393
So, I'm sorry,
you're gonna have to,

43:33.480 --> 43:35.613
you're going to have
to rewrite this.

43:43.969 --> 43:47.625
Do you wanna tell me what's
going on with you, Sadie?

43:50.453 --> 43:52.978
[bell ringing]

43:53.935 --> 43:54.893
- I'm fine.

43:54.980 --> 43:56.634
I'll just re-do it.

44:10.691 --> 44:13.868
[Francis groaning]

44:13.955 --> 44:14.956
- [Jesse] You think
you can steal my phone

44:15.043 --> 44:15.783
and get away with it?

44:15.870 --> 44:16.828
- Hey!

44:16.915 --> 44:17.611
- [Francis] It wasn't me!

44:17.698 --> 44:19.569
- Let him go!

44:19.657 --> 44:21.484
- [Jesse] You're dead.

44:25.184 --> 44:27.099
- You're just gonna let him go?

44:27.186 --> 44:28.100
- What did he do?

44:29.536 --> 44:30.972
- Just forget it.

44:31.059 --> 44:31.973
Let's go, Francis.

44:33.322 --> 44:34.280
Come on, Francis.

44:34.367 --> 44:35.368
What did he say?

44:37.065 --> 44:39.372
- [Francis] He knows about
the phone thing, Sadie.

44:39.459 --> 44:40.634
He said I'm dead.

44:45.465 --> 44:47.641
[sighing]

44:49.034 --> 44:50.296
- [Deak] You wanna
explain who the hell's

44:50.383 --> 44:51.645
gunning for my grandson?

44:52.994 --> 44:55.083
- Don't worry, I'll
figure something out.

45:01.220 --> 45:03.309
What're you doing here?

45:03.396 --> 45:05.790
- Just trying to see what's new

45:05.877 --> 45:07.617
since I've been
out of the cockpit.

45:10.446 --> 45:11.273
- Great.

45:27.246 --> 45:30.162
[video game commotion]

45:30.249 --> 45:32.251
I can turn off the
sound if it bugs you.

45:33.078 --> 45:36.385
[video game commotion]

45:41.347 --> 45:43.349
- How 'bout I take a
break and join you?

45:46.656 --> 45:47.483
- Okay,

45:47.570 --> 45:48.920
but I'm pretty good.

45:49.007 --> 45:51.096
- Why does that not surprise me?

45:52.097 --> 45:55.404
[video game commotion]

45:58.233 --> 45:59.757
Damn girl, you weren't kidding.

46:03.369 --> 46:04.762
Oh, yeah, well, how 'bout...

46:06.111 --> 46:07.634
No, he didn't do it.

46:10.419 --> 46:12.334
How did you do that?

46:12.421 --> 46:13.466
- Use the controller.

46:14.772 --> 46:17.209
- I'm trying.
[laughing]

46:17.296 --> 46:18.471
Ouch.

46:18.558 --> 46:21.126
What? Okay. Kick. X, kick.

46:21.213 --> 46:22.518
He's not kicking.

46:22.605 --> 46:24.042
[video game commotion]

46:24.129 --> 46:24.956
Oooh.

46:26.479 --> 46:28.611
Oh, I hit you once.

46:28.698 --> 46:29.874
- [Sadie] You hit me once?
- [Cyrus] Did you see that?

46:29.961 --> 46:31.092
- Congratulations.

46:31.179 --> 46:32.920
- Well, it was a
pretty good hit.

46:33.007 --> 46:34.574
[video game commotion]

46:34.661 --> 46:35.923
Ow, ow, ow.

46:36.837 --> 46:37.969
[laughing]

46:38.056 --> 46:40.058
Man, my guy's all messed up.

46:41.537 --> 46:43.931
Man, I can't believe
you've never smoked weed.

46:44.018 --> 46:45.063
- [Rae] Okay, what do I?

46:45.150 --> 46:46.891
- Oh, you just gotta take this.

46:48.196 --> 46:49.197
And you light that.

46:49.284 --> 46:50.546
And just inhale through that.

46:52.157 --> 46:52.984
Simple.

46:53.071 --> 46:54.115
- Don't laugh at me.

46:54.202 --> 46:55.116
- I promise, I won't laughing.

46:57.684 --> 46:58.511
- Oh.

47:06.606 --> 47:08.826
[coughing]

47:12.003 --> 47:12.830
- That's it.

47:14.527 --> 47:15.789
- [Rae] All right.
- [Cyrus] You did it.

47:15.876 --> 47:17.269
- [Rae] I did it.
- [Cyrus] Yeah.

47:17.356 --> 47:19.097
- Now am I supposed
to feel something now?

47:19.184 --> 47:21.186
- It might take a
minute but you will.

47:22.013 --> 47:22.840
- Okay.

47:28.497 --> 47:30.456
- Hey, you know what
I was thinking about?

47:30.543 --> 47:31.370
- What?

47:33.372 --> 47:34.503
- I was thinking about

47:37.115 --> 47:40.596
maybe going to see the doctor,
you were telling me about.

47:40.683 --> 47:41.423
- Oh yeah?

47:41.510 --> 47:42.337
- Yeah.

47:43.295 --> 47:44.687
Randall's on my ass.

47:44.774 --> 47:45.950
I just,

47:47.560 --> 47:48.996
I need out of that shop.

47:51.129 --> 47:51.912
- Okay.

47:53.348 --> 47:55.568
Yeah, I can schedule
something for you.

47:56.743 --> 47:58.092
- You will?

47:58.179 --> 47:59.180
- Of course.

48:00.573 --> 48:01.661
That's great.

48:15.762 --> 48:16.589
- What?

48:22.203 --> 48:23.596
- Nothing, I'm just happy.

48:25.946 --> 48:27.208
I'm just glad you're here.

48:38.263 --> 48:39.307
- Hey, Francis.

48:40.352 --> 48:41.440
- Oh, hey.

48:42.963 --> 48:44.617
- I just have to
go to the bathroom.

48:44.704 --> 48:45.531
Then we can go.

48:52.451 --> 48:53.408
Don't worry.

48:54.932 --> 48:56.542
Jesse's at practice and
I'll just be a second.

49:03.114 --> 49:06.421
[basketball commotion]

49:07.988 --> 49:10.034
- [Coach] Oh yes, Tucker.

49:15.300 --> 49:16.127
Good shot.

49:26.050 --> 49:26.876
- Jesse!

49:50.030 --> 49:51.989
Well, I've been
meaning to talk to you.

49:52.076 --> 49:52.990
- Oh, yeah?

49:56.863 --> 49:58.778
- You know my friend, Francis?

50:02.042 --> 50:03.609
Yeah, well,

50:03.696 --> 50:05.785
lately he's been, different.

50:07.004 --> 50:08.875
He's been talking a
lot about Columbine.

50:10.007 --> 50:11.660
- What's that?

50:11.747 --> 50:13.706
- You know, that place where
those students went crazy

50:13.793 --> 50:15.403
and killed all those other kids.

50:16.578 --> 50:19.799
Francis has been
obsessed with it.

50:19.886 --> 50:20.713
And then

50:23.368 --> 50:24.717
I found this in his bag.

50:26.675 --> 50:30.157
Anyway, I've just been
meaning to warn you because,

50:30.244 --> 50:31.985
since you've been
threatening him.

50:33.813 --> 50:36.207
Okay, I'll let you
get back to practice.

50:48.306 --> 50:49.698
- What did you just do?

50:51.309 --> 50:52.092
- Well,

50:53.963 --> 50:56.401
I don't think you'll have to
worry about Jesse for a while.

50:56.488 --> 50:57.750
- What did you show him?

51:00.231 --> 51:02.363
- Okay, don't freak out.

51:11.285 --> 51:13.853
- [Francis] What is that?!

51:13.940 --> 51:15.942
- My dad gave it to
my mom when he left.

51:18.771 --> 51:20.033
Well, Jesse thinks
you're psychotic now,

51:20.120 --> 51:21.426
so I don't he'll mess with you.

51:21.513 --> 51:23.602
- What if he reports
me or something?

51:23.689 --> 51:25.256
- Settle down, it's not loaded.

51:29.782 --> 51:31.044
What's to report.

51:31.131 --> 51:33.177
I mean, you didn't do anything.

51:33.264 --> 51:35.004
I'll put it back
when we get home.

51:36.658 --> 51:38.051
Come on, let's go.

51:39.139 --> 51:42.229
[hospital commotion]

51:46.277 --> 51:47.887
- Wow, sexy.

51:47.974 --> 51:49.410
[laughing]

51:49.497 --> 51:50.803
- I think I'm pulling it off.

51:50.890 --> 51:52.848
- Yeah, I think you are too.

52:00.813 --> 52:02.728
Don't tell me you're
scared of needles.

52:04.295 --> 52:06.166
- I thought he was just
going to x-ray my back.

52:06.253 --> 52:07.602
- No, I've gotta
draw your blood,

52:07.689 --> 52:09.648
it's just part of the work up.

52:11.084 --> 52:12.651
Don't worry,

52:12.738 --> 52:14.087
I'm really good at it

52:14.174 --> 52:15.219
and you're not even
gonna feel anything.

52:15.306 --> 52:17.438
You just have to loosen up.

52:17.525 --> 52:19.788
[laughing]

52:23.966 --> 52:25.229
Cyrus, what?

52:25.316 --> 52:27.666
- Babe, we just smoked pot.

52:27.753 --> 52:30.190
That shit stays in
your system for weeks.

52:30.277 --> 52:31.931
- Come on, the doctor
is not gonna care

52:32.018 --> 52:33.846
about some marijuana.

52:34.803 --> 52:36.370
It's not even illegal.

52:36.457 --> 52:38.851
- You guys had me waiting
here for like an hour.

52:40.157 --> 52:41.462
I need to get back to work.

52:44.683 --> 52:46.119
- I really think you're
overreacting, okay?

52:46.206 --> 52:47.033
- Look, I'll see
you later, okay?

52:47.120 --> 52:48.165
I'll see you tonight.

52:52.299 --> 52:53.126
- Hey.

52:54.258 --> 52:58.044
[distant police siren alarming]

52:59.611 --> 53:00.829
Hey!

53:00.916 --> 53:02.483
Hey, can you stop for a second?

53:07.227 --> 53:08.750
I know what's going on.

53:08.837 --> 53:10.404
- What?

53:10.491 --> 53:11.710
There's nothing going
on, I need to be at work.

53:13.320 --> 53:15.192
- Cyrus, I'm a nurse.

53:15.279 --> 53:16.541
You think I haven't seen someone

53:16.628 --> 53:18.195
with a pain killer
problem before?

53:18.282 --> 53:19.326
[chuckling]
- What?

53:19.413 --> 53:20.936
- Hey, I'm not judging.

53:22.503 --> 53:23.765
- I have pain, I
take painkillers.

53:23.852 --> 53:24.940
It's what they're for.

53:30.816 --> 53:32.209
- Listen.

53:32.296 --> 53:33.819
It's a small town.

53:33.906 --> 53:35.473
Every third person who comes in

53:35.560 --> 53:37.649
has something in their system.

53:37.736 --> 53:38.563
Whatever.

53:40.086 --> 53:43.568
But if you want to fix
this thing long-term,

53:43.655 --> 53:46.223
you're going to have to
stop with the pills, okay?

53:46.310 --> 53:48.964
There's stuff you can
do, physical therapy

53:49.051 --> 53:50.488
and maybe you need surgery.

53:50.575 --> 53:51.837
- How am I supposed to
get by in the meantime?

53:51.924 --> 53:53.230
How am I supposed to work?

53:54.666 --> 53:55.841
- We can figure it out.

53:57.669 --> 53:59.279
- Jesus Christ.

53:59.366 --> 54:01.107
I can't even afford any
of this in the first place

54:01.194 --> 54:03.240
and now you tell me that I
have to stop taking the pills,

54:03.327 --> 54:05.633
which means I have to stop
going to work and gettin' paid.

54:05.720 --> 54:07.592
Now, does that make
any sense to you?!

54:09.985 --> 54:11.422
- Can you just come back inside?

54:11.509 --> 54:13.728
- I can't be this guy
that you want me to be.

54:16.253 --> 54:17.079
- What do you think?

54:17.166 --> 54:18.124
What guy?

54:19.038 --> 54:20.257
- This is fucking stupid.

54:22.737 --> 54:24.957
[sighing]

54:25.044 --> 54:26.524
[phone buzzing]

54:26.611 --> 54:27.438
- Oh, God.

54:31.093 --> 54:32.747
Sorry, Bradley.

54:32.834 --> 54:35.402
[somber music]

54:53.899 --> 54:56.162
[groaning]

54:57.772 --> 55:00.645
[airplane zooming]

55:14.441 --> 55:15.355
Oh, thanks hon.

55:18.184 --> 55:19.403
- I'll be out until late.

55:20.578 --> 55:23.102
Deak's taking us
to a gory movie.

55:23.189 --> 55:24.799
- Ugh, better him than me.

55:27.672 --> 55:29.064
- Is Cyrus coming over?

55:30.414 --> 55:31.632
- [Rae] I don't think so.

55:32.677 --> 55:33.504
- How come?

55:34.548 --> 55:35.419
- We had a fight.

55:40.859 --> 55:42.469
Hey,

55:42.556 --> 55:44.341
how come I'm getting calls
from Bradley about you?

55:45.820 --> 55:46.908
- Maybe he misses you.

55:48.040 --> 55:49.476
- What did you do?

55:49.563 --> 55:50.956
- I didn't do anything.

55:51.043 --> 55:52.392
I did my English assignment.

55:56.788 --> 55:58.006
- Have fun at the movie.

56:02.707 --> 56:05.710
[somber beat music]

56:15.241 --> 56:16.068
- Here you go.

56:18.287 --> 56:20.681
Well, isn't this
a nice surprise.

56:21.813 --> 56:24.119
- What do you got
that cheap and potent?

56:33.607 --> 56:34.434
- Bad day?

56:35.566 --> 56:36.828
- [Cyrus] Pretty shitty, yeah.

56:39.526 --> 56:41.006
- You wanna talk about it?

56:51.364 --> 56:56.369
Well, my asshole boyfriend
just got back with his wife.

56:58.545 --> 57:01.243
[pills rattling]

57:02.941 --> 57:06.031
You can take that with whiskey?

57:06.118 --> 57:07.424
- Numbs the fuck outta ya.

57:12.951 --> 57:14.822
- Why not, I get off in an hour.

57:24.179 --> 57:25.006
Oooh.

57:26.965 --> 57:27.792
[laughing]

57:27.879 --> 57:29.054
Bad boy, Cyrus, huh?

57:30.316 --> 57:33.798
[action movie explosions]

57:38.498 --> 57:40.587
- [Deak] Can't believe
we paid for that garbage.

57:40.674 --> 57:41.806
- What, you didn't like it?

57:41.893 --> 57:43.285
- [Deak] It was disgusting.

57:44.548 --> 57:45.766
- [Sadie] Yeah.

57:45.853 --> 57:46.898
- [Deak] What'd
you think, Francis?

57:46.985 --> 57:47.855
- It was okay.

57:48.769 --> 57:50.292
- It wasn't "okay."

57:50.379 --> 57:52.294
You liked it or you didn't.

57:52.381 --> 57:54.427
- I guess I didn't like it then.

57:54.514 --> 57:55.994
- How could you not like it?

57:57.169 --> 57:58.475
- Why don't you just
tell me what I think,

57:58.562 --> 58:00.477
instead of making me guess?

58:00.564 --> 58:01.521
[laughing]

58:01.608 --> 58:03.349
- Fine, don't like it then.

58:03.436 --> 58:04.568
I thought it was great.

58:07.832 --> 58:10.095
I'm just gonna get some
ice cream for my mom.

58:11.313 --> 58:12.576
- Hold on a minute.

58:12.663 --> 58:14.708
Pick me up some
hemorrhoid cream.

58:14.795 --> 58:16.231
[giggling]

58:16.318 --> 58:17.972
What? I need it!

58:18.059 --> 58:20.671
You're gonna need some too
when you get my age, here.

58:20.758 --> 58:21.759
And hurry back.

58:21.846 --> 58:24.805
[thunder rumbling]

58:32.378 --> 58:35.512
[woman laughing]

58:35.599 --> 58:38.079
[man moaning]

58:54.879 --> 58:56.663
- [Cyrus] Where you going?

58:56.750 --> 58:57.708
- [Carla] I have to pee.

58:57.795 --> 58:59.013
- [Cyrus] Oh, fuck.

58:59.100 --> 59:00.667
Shit, Carla.

59:00.754 --> 59:03.365
- [Carla] Just come
inside and have a drink.

59:03.452 --> 59:04.453
- [Cyrus] No, I gotta go.

59:04.541 --> 59:05.585
Fuck.

59:05.672 --> 59:08.022
- [Carla] Just wait for me then.

59:11.983 --> 59:14.638
[door slamming]

59:15.552 --> 59:17.075
- [Cyrus] Oh, shit.

59:25.039 --> 59:27.781
[dramatic music]

59:42.274 --> 59:43.884
- Sadie, you're sopping wet.

59:43.971 --> 59:45.190
- I have to talk to you.

59:46.452 --> 59:47.279
- Okay.

59:49.107 --> 59:50.935
Just put dry clothes
on first, okay,

59:51.022 --> 59:52.284
and then we'll talk.

59:56.418 --> 59:58.986
[somber music]

01:00:03.208 --> 01:00:06.124
[thunder rumbling]

01:00:20.486 --> 01:00:23.837
Hey, babe, can
you sit for a sec?

01:00:28.146 --> 01:00:29.408
I have to tell you something.

01:00:29.495 --> 01:00:31.236
- I need to tell
you something too.

01:00:31.323 --> 01:00:32.150
- Okay.

01:00:34.456 --> 01:00:36.110
Let me go first, okay?

01:00:36.197 --> 01:00:37.634
It's kinda big.

01:00:40.811 --> 01:00:42.856
I got a call tonight
about your dad.

01:00:48.035 --> 01:00:50.472
He's at a military
hospital in Jordan.

01:00:51.343 --> 01:00:52.387
It's okay, babe.

01:00:52.474 --> 01:00:54.085
He's, he's, he's gonna be okay.

01:00:58.045 --> 01:00:59.525
Yeah, I talked to him.

01:01:00.569 --> 01:01:01.701
- Dad, what'd he say?

01:01:03.398 --> 01:01:04.748
- Well,

01:01:04.835 --> 01:01:06.837
he said that he just has to stay

01:01:06.924 --> 01:01:08.839
under observation
for a few weeks.

01:01:08.926 --> 01:01:09.709
And then,

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:16.803
he's, he might be coming back.

01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:17.935
- He's coming home?

01:01:20.198 --> 01:01:21.939
- That's what he said.

01:01:22.026 --> 01:01:24.855
That's what he said but, you
know, he's said that before.

01:01:30.861 --> 01:01:33.298
[thunder rumbling]

01:01:33.385 --> 01:01:37.824
And babe, he also said that
you told him that I missed him.

01:01:41.741 --> 01:01:43.177
- Well,

01:01:43.264 --> 01:01:44.048
don't you?

01:01:50.097 --> 01:01:51.664
- You know what I think?

01:01:51.751 --> 01:01:55.059
I think that all I need is you.

01:01:56.103 --> 01:01:58.018
Well, you and Carla.

01:01:58.105 --> 01:01:58.889
My girls.

01:02:13.251 --> 01:02:15.470
You thought I didn't
see there was ice cream?

01:02:19.431 --> 01:02:21.433
Hey, what did you wanna tell me?

01:02:25.654 --> 01:02:27.178
- Oh,

01:02:27.265 --> 01:02:29.528
I was gonna tell you
about a scene in the movie

01:02:29.615 --> 01:02:32.749
but I think it's
too gross for you.

01:02:35.229 --> 01:02:36.274
- If you think it's too gross,

01:02:36.361 --> 01:02:38.624
I think it's gonna be too gross.

01:02:38.711 --> 01:02:40.104
You know I can't stand it.

01:02:41.279 --> 01:02:42.106
- I know.

01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:45.283
- You like the movie?

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:47.372
- Mhmm.

01:02:47.459 --> 01:02:49.026
It was good.

01:02:49.113 --> 01:02:51.768
[somber music]

01:03:06.478 --> 01:03:09.133
[clock ticking]

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:18.620
[engine rumbling]

01:03:25.714 --> 01:03:27.499
- You bring me my
hemorrhoid cream?

01:03:28.717 --> 01:03:29.544
- Guess what?

01:03:31.242 --> 01:03:33.070
- You got something you
wanna say to me, spit it out!

01:03:33.157 --> 01:03:34.506
Making me guess.

01:03:34.593 --> 01:03:35.768
- My dad's coming home.

01:03:37.378 --> 01:03:38.815
He got injured but he's okay.

01:03:42.514 --> 01:03:43.689
Isn't that good news?!

01:03:43.776 --> 01:03:44.821
- Sure it is, sure it is.

01:03:46.170 --> 01:03:46.910
- What?

01:03:46.997 --> 01:03:47.824
- What? What?

01:03:49.303 --> 01:03:51.610
You want me to start
whoopin' and hollerin'?!

01:03:51.697 --> 01:03:52.916
- I guess it'd just be
nice if someone else

01:03:53.003 --> 01:03:54.482
besides me was happy.

01:03:54.569 --> 01:03:57.181
[door opening]

01:04:01.011 --> 01:04:03.230
- [Deak] You look like roadkill.

01:04:03.317 --> 01:04:04.753
- Good morning to you too.

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:07.104
I guess you don't want
this coffee I made you.

01:04:08.279 --> 01:04:11.108
- You'll be amazed at
my ability to insult you

01:04:11.195 --> 01:04:13.762
and drink your
coffee all at once.

01:04:14.676 --> 01:04:15.721
- Morning, Sadie.

01:04:29.561 --> 01:04:30.475
- [Cyrus] Morning.

01:04:47.318 --> 01:04:48.928
- Have Mom and
Carla ever fought?

01:04:50.234 --> 01:04:51.713
- Oh, my daughter's
thoughtless enough to piss off

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:54.064
just about anyone if you
give her enough time.

01:04:55.543 --> 01:04:58.807
But they've been the steadiest
thing in each other's lives

01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:00.244
for coming on twenty years.

01:05:01.288 --> 01:05:02.420
Like you and Francis.

01:05:04.248 --> 01:05:06.511
Can you imagine that little
fella getting along without you?

01:05:06.598 --> 01:05:10.080
[distant train whistling]

01:05:31.318 --> 01:05:32.711
- [Cyrus] I'm not really used to

01:05:32.798 --> 01:05:35.540
getting called out on my shit.

01:05:35.627 --> 01:05:36.889
I know that I've been making

01:05:36.976 --> 01:05:38.325
some boneheaded
decisions lately,

01:05:38.412 --> 01:05:40.632
but I don't wanna
fuck it up with you.

01:05:43.287 --> 01:05:46.986
- [Rae] Well, what
about the pills?

01:05:47.073 --> 01:05:47.856
- [Cyrus] It's over.

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:48.640
- [Rae] It's over?

01:05:48.727 --> 01:05:49.771
- [Cyrus] Yeah.

01:05:49.858 --> 01:05:51.643
Yeah, I'm stopping, It's done.

01:05:53.514 --> 01:05:55.473
- Do you think it's
gonna be that easy?

01:05:57.301 --> 01:05:59.042
- [Cyrus] I don't know
what it's gonna be like,

01:05:59.129 --> 01:06:03.263
I just know that I can't, I
can't do it anymore, you know.

01:06:03.350 --> 01:06:04.961
I'm not kidding
around here, Rae.

01:06:10.488 --> 01:06:11.880
I think, uh,

01:06:14.405 --> 01:06:15.797
I think I love you.

01:06:20.063 --> 01:06:21.107
I just, I do.

01:06:25.329 --> 01:06:26.765
- Well, I do too.

01:06:28.419 --> 01:06:30.595
Yeah.

01:06:30.682 --> 01:06:34.077
[Cyrus and Rae laughing]

01:06:35.295 --> 01:06:38.298
[ominous music]

01:06:38.385 --> 01:06:41.562
[somber guitar music]

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:06.674
[mixer buzzing]

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:12.028
- [Rae] Do you need
some coffee, babe?

01:07:13.203 --> 01:07:15.901

01:21:52.168 --> 01:21:52.951

01:21:54.083 --> 01:21:54.910
Oh, hey.

01:21:57.086 --> 01:21:57.913
Wait, what?

01:21:59.392 --> 01:22:01.133
No, I'll come right
there, I'm leaving now.

[door clicking]

01:22:21.197 --> 01:22:22.198

01:22:24.504 --> 01:22:26.115
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

01:22:27.638 --> 01:22:29.857
- They said the doctor will
be out soon, so we can just.

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:31.598
- Okay, just?

01:22:31.685 --> 01:22:33.122
- Yeah, sit.

01:22:33.209 --> 01:22:34.036
- Okay.

01:22:42.653 --> 01:22:44.176
Wait, why are you here?

01:22:45.351 --> 01:22:46.309
Did they call you?

01:22:47.658 --> 01:22:49.138
- No, I found him.

01:22:50.530 --> 01:22:51.488
- You found him?

01:22:53.969 --> 01:22:55.492
- In his RV.

01:22:55.579 --> 01:22:56.841
He was, he was out cold.

01:23:00.932 --> 01:23:02.151
- Why were you in his RV?

01:23:07.156 --> 01:23:07.983
- [Dr. Ross] Hey, Rae.

01:23:08.896 --> 01:23:10.202
- Hi, Dr. Ross.

01:23:11.116 --> 01:23:11.856
How is he?

01:23:11.943 --> 01:23:12.857
- Not great.

01:23:13.814 --> 01:23:14.990
He overdosed.

01:23:19.907 --> 01:23:21.257
All right.

01:23:21.344 --> 01:23:22.693
Go ahead and come with me.

[video game commotion]

01:23:43.453 --> 01:23:46.021
- Sadie, was I a good kisser?

01:23:47.935 --> 01:23:48.762
- Um,

01:23:50.286 --> 01:23:52.027
I don't really
know much about it.

01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:55.117
- But did you like it?

01:23:59.730 --> 01:24:01.079
- It was okay.

01:24:01.166 --> 01:24:02.950
- Would could I do
to make you like it?

01:24:03.038 --> 01:24:06.563
[video game commotion]

01:24:06.650 --> 01:24:07.477

like kissing you, Francis.

01:24:11.481 --> 01:24:13.352
I mean, you're still a kid.

01:24:23.971 --> 01:24:26.670
- I saw Cyrus when they
put him in the ambulance.

01:24:27.932 --> 01:24:30.021
He looked all grey.

01:24:32.589 --> 01:24:34.243
What do you think
happened to him?

01:24:37.028 --> 01:24:38.247
- He took too many pills.

01:24:39.770 --> 01:24:41.554
- [Francis] Why would
he take too many pills?

01:24:43.252 --> 01:24:45.515
- His back probably hurt.

01:24:45.602 --> 01:24:48.909
[video game commotion]

01:24:50.128 --> 01:24:52.130

It's not like they
write on the bottle

someone in the hospital.

Did you eat?

01:25:33.302 --> 01:25:34.085
- [Sadie] Yeah.

01:25:34.172 --> 01:25:34.999
- Yeah?

01:25:39.482 --> 01:25:40.309
Sadie,

01:25:44.661 --> 01:25:45.575
I have to tell you

01:25:47.011 --> 01:25:48.665
that Cyrus

01:25:50.841 --> 01:25:53.322
is, he's dead.

01:25:54.975 --> 01:25:55.976
[crying]

01:25:56.063 --> 01:25:56.977
He died.

01:25:58.979 --> 01:26:00.677
At the hospital.

01:26:00.764 --> 01:26:02.722
He went into a coma and they
couldn't get him out of it.

01:26:22.873 --> 01:26:23.830
Did you hear me?

01:26:27.094 --> 01:26:27.921
- Yeah.

01:26:33.884 --> 01:26:36.321
- Just thought I should
tell you, and, you know.

01:26:38.541 --> 01:26:41.413
If you have questions or if
you wanna talk to me about it.

01:26:43.894 --> 01:26:44.895
- [Sadie] Not really.

01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:54.731
- But you understand
what I'm saying, right?

01:26:58.387 --> 01:26:59.214
- Yeah.

01:27:05.568 --> 01:27:07.309
When dad comes
back I was thinking

01:27:07.396 --> 01:27:10.225
that I could take some walks
with him to help him recover.

01:27:11.313 --> 01:27:13.271
Like physical
therapy or whatever.

01:27:18.929 --> 01:27:20.931
- When your dad comes back?

01:27:23.412 --> 01:27:25.892
Sadie, he's not going
to be living with us.

01:27:28.808 --> 01:27:30.549
- What?

01:27:30.636 --> 01:27:33.639
- He's going to live with your
grandpa when he comes back.

01:27:33.726 --> 01:27:35.075
- But that's an hour away.

01:27:35.162 --> 01:27:37.295
- I know it's not
what you wanted, okay?

01:27:37.382 --> 01:27:38.775
But it's what is
going to happen!

01:27:38.862 --> 01:27:40.429
- But Cyrus is gone now.

01:27:49.264 --> 01:27:50.090
- Yeah.

01:27:53.355 --> 01:27:54.878
Yes.

01:27:54.965 --> 01:27:57.620
That doesn't make
it any different.

01:28:06.019 --> 01:28:06.846
What?

01:28:10.328 --> 01:28:12.548
I don't understand
what's going on with you?

Okay.

01:32:29.456 --> 01:32:31.023
I thought when you came home

01:32:31.110 --> 01:32:33.199
we'd be able to get things
back to how they were.

01:32:35.245 --> 01:32:36.202
But, I don't know.

01:32:37.595 --> 01:32:39.249
Maybe they were broken then too.

01:32:41.425 --> 01:32:44.080
You probably gave up on
fixing them a long time ago.

01:32:46.125 --> 01:32:48.519
Because I'm thinking the
stuff you do to fix things

01:32:48.606 --> 01:32:50.086
over there doesn't work here.

01:32:51.957 --> 01:32:54.090
Maybe it doesn't really
work there either.

01:32:58.050 --> 01:33:01.924
Anyway, I guess I just
wanted to say I love you.

01:33:03.752 --> 01:33:04.579
Still.
