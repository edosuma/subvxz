12:25.078 --> 12:27.162
something l'm really
interested in.

12:27.247 --> 12:30.040
Who has more power?
Miss America or Miss USA?

12:30.125 --> 12:32.793

one's elected and the
other one's appointed.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.253
l think your water
just broke.

12:34.337 --> 12:35.712

Now you can't
mix milk and meat.
You got that?

12:43.972 --> 12:46.348
And on Christmas Day,
you must eat Chinese food,

12:46.433 --> 12:48.559
and pork is
strictly forbidden !

12:48.643 --> 12:49.643
Oh-oh !

12:49.894 --> 12:52.855
All these rules! l feel
like l'm in a strip club!

Well, Dad,
what do you want to
talk about tonight?

12:56.693 --> 12:57.734
Hmm. . .

Why so formal, Lenny?
You're my go-to guy.

Oh, about that.

Please welcome
our newest panelist,
Disco Stu.

13:23.344 --> 13:26.096
Disco Stu knows his place.

13:26.389 --> 13:29.433
My husband's
a power-mad star.

13:29.851 --> 13:33.562

Krusty, you know Diane, Stu,
and Jeremy from the network.

Hey, hey.
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

some bad news.

You're canceling me!

Krusty, Krusty,
TV is a fickle business.
You've had a good run.

but you're always eating.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.195
Will you sign
an autograph for my boy?

My pleasure.

14:27.158 --> 14:29.785
So did l, son.
And look where l am today.

Boy, everybody loves my show.

14:33.623 --> 14:34.873
lt's great, Dad.

14:34.958 --> 14:38.752
You have tremendous power.
And now it's time
to put it to use.

14:39.128 --> 14:41.797
Yes, you're right.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.759
Duck, Mister Lincoln !

14:48.263 --> 14:49.888
Thank you, Homer.

14:52.850 --> 14:55.561
No, Dad. l mean,
you should use
your time on the air

14:55.645 --> 14:58.021
to say things that
really mean something.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.982

and leave a big fat corpse!

Well, l took
Bart's advice last week,
so l guess it's Lisa's turn.

own network dumped me,

15:29.596 --> 15:33.473
l thought
maybe l could do a show
on (GROWLS) Fox.

15:33.641 --> 15:34.933
l'm sorry, Krusty.

15:35.018 --> 15:38.395
People aren't
interested in stars anymore.
They want reality.

15:38.479 --> 15:39.438
Way ahead of ya.

15:39.522 --> 15:43.442
How about a show
where girls think
l'm a millionaire?

But what they don't know
is l'm rife with disease!

15:47.822 --> 15:51.742

where l move in
with a poor family

15:51.826 --> 15:54.870
and laugh at them?

you televise my

Please, you people are known
for taking chances on crap.

we've had a great time
on this show

16:08.801 --> 16:11.428
riffing on small,
unimportant subjects.

16:11.512 --> 16:12.596

Dirty words you can

16:24.192 --> 16:27.986

solely on important issues.

16:29.113 --> 16:32.366
Every year, the gulf
between rich and poor

on unrealistic debt
repayment schedules.
