The Simpsons

D'oh!

00:25.446 --> 00:28.490
If you ask me,
Muhammad Ali
in his prime

00:28.574 --> 00:31.076
was much better
than anti-lock brakes.

00:31.160 --> 00:33.912
Yeah.
But what about Johnny Mathis
versus Diet Pepsi?

00:33.996 --> 00:35.872
I cannot listen
to this again!

00:35.957 --> 00:40.210
Guys, I just ordered
my wife the greatest
anniversary present.

00:40.294 --> 00:41.586
A koi pond!

00:41.671 --> 00:43.130
A koi pond?

00:43.214 --> 00:45.716
Yeah. A meditative
lily pond with big,

00:45.800 --> 00:47.884
beautiful fish that
fry up really good.

00:47.969 --> 00:49.261
That's the perfect gift.

00:49.345 --> 00:52.431
Yeah. You don't even
have to feed the fish,
'cause squirrels drown in it.

00:52.515 --> 00:54.474
You got this
husband thing down, Homer.

00:54.559 --> 00:57.269
Yeah. You must be
some kind of marriage
super genius.

00:57.353 --> 00:58.687
How about a few tips?

00:58.771 --> 01:00.313
Certainly, Lenford.

01:00.398 --> 01:03.233
Make every day
a celebration
of your love.

01:03.317 --> 01:05.360
Surprise her
with a pasta salad.

01:05.444 --> 01:07.404
Put a mini-beret
on your wang.

01:07.488 --> 01:09.364
This stuff is gold.

01:09.490 --> 01:11.408
Happy marriage,
here I come.

01:12.952 --> 01:15.746
This'll really help
with my speed dating.

01:17.957 --> 01:19.958
I got 400 no's.

01:21.210 --> 01:23.795
I can't wait to
see my surprise!

01:24.756 --> 01:27.174
Hey, hey, hey!
No peeking!

01:28.342 --> 01:30.385
Happy anniversary, Marge!

01:35.224 --> 01:38.852
A koi pond!
It's beautiful!

01:39.020 --> 01:42.898
Oh, you sweet,
wonderful man-child.

01:43.900 --> 01:48.069
I finally have
a peaceful place to sit
and hear my own thoughts.

01:48.488 --> 01:51.364
How much money
did he piss away on this?

01:56.829 --> 01:58.288
What was that?

02:00.625 --> 02:02.125
What the hell
is that noise?

02:02.210 --> 02:04.377
That caterpillar
is screaming.

02:08.925 --> 02:11.176
The poor thing's
in pain.

02:13.304 --> 02:17.516
What he needs is a visit
from kindly old Doctor Foot.

02:18.351 --> 02:20.936
Hold it right there,
Doctor Foot.

02:21.229 --> 02:25.398
You're about to kill
an endangered species,
the screamapillar,

02:27.026 --> 02:29.903
which has chosen
your yard as its home.

02:30.071 --> 02:31.863
Fine, I won't kill it.

02:31.948 --> 02:33.365
Finish the job.

02:34.158 --> 02:37.994
Mr. Simpson, allowing
an endangered species to die
is a federal offense

02:38.079 --> 02:40.872
under the Reversal of
Freedoms Act of 1994.

02:40.957 --> 02:42.541
You are now
legally responsible

02:42.625 --> 02:46.044
for the safety and well-being
of this screamapillar.

02:46.170 --> 02:48.922
Everything you need to know
is in this pamphlet.

02:50.925 --> 02:53.051
Wow. Look at
all this stuff.

02:53.135 --> 02:55.846
"Without constant reassurance,
it will die.

02:55.930 --> 02:58.014
"It's sexually
attracted to fire. "

02:58.099 --> 03:00.559
Are you sure God doesn't
want it to be dead?

03:00.643 --> 03:03.687
Hey, what's God gonna do?
Make my wife leave me again?

03:07.775 --> 03:09.609
What does he want now?

03:09.944 --> 03:12.445
If he wants to sleep
with us, forget it!

03:27.128 --> 03:29.462
Put him down, boy!
Put him down!

03:34.927 --> 03:37.929
"Once upon a time
there were three bears.

03:38.055 --> 03:39.389
"The end. "

03:41.976 --> 03:44.686
Oh, fine! I'll go
back to the beginning!

03:46.731 --> 03:51.568
Oh, no!
I crushed that horrible bug!
What should I do?

03:52.945 --> 03:55.864
Bury it, quickly,
before anyone finds out.

03:56.908 --> 03:58.283
I'm gonna tell!

03:58.367 --> 03:59.701
The hell you will!

04:03.831 --> 04:07.500
Now we're in it together.
There's no going back.

04:09.170 --> 04:10.462
Yeah!

04:18.637 --> 04:20.512
Stop what you're doing!

04:23.684 --> 04:25.602
Why don't I hear
any screaming?

04:25.686 --> 04:27.103
He's sleeping!

04:27.188 --> 04:29.439
Then why don't I hear
any sleep screams?

04:29.523 --> 04:32.108
Well, the thing
about that is...

04:34.320 --> 04:36.613
Woo-hoo! He's alive!

04:38.157 --> 04:40.158
Now you can't punish me.

04:40.660 --> 04:44.788
Homer Simpson,
for attempted insecticide
and aggravated buggery,

04:44.872 --> 04:48.208
I sentence you to 200 hours
of community service.

04:49.669 --> 04:52.754
Next case. Duffman v.
Duff Brewing Corporation.

04:53.255 --> 04:55.924
Duffman's pension
has been mismanaged!

04:56.008 --> 04:57.300
Oh, yeah!

04:58.135 --> 04:59.135
Objection.

04:59.220 --> 05:01.137
That party-hearty
attitude is a registered

05:01.222 --> 05:03.098
trademark of
the Duff Corporation.

05:03.182 --> 05:05.934
Whatever happened
to fair use?

05:08.354 --> 05:10.397
Lousy community service!

05:10.898 --> 05:14.025
Meals on Wheels!
Eat it up or I go to jail.

05:15.987 --> 05:18.279
Didn't these meals
used to have a cobbler?

05:18.364 --> 05:20.782
They discontinued
the cobbler.

05:21.242 --> 05:23.076
You smell like cobbler.

05:23.160 --> 05:26.246
Now let's not get into
who smells like what.

05:32.753 --> 05:34.504
Come in.

05:48.436 --> 05:52.063
Oh, I can't let you
leave now.

05:55.818 --> 05:57.402
Safe and sound.

06:00.656 --> 06:02.157
That's better.

06:04.744 --> 06:08.788
Thank God I'm out of matches!
Oh, no. Here's another one.

06:11.876 --> 06:15.253
Please don't kill me!
I won't tell anyone
about the skeleton!

06:15.337 --> 06:17.547
And I could bring
you more victims!

06:17.631 --> 06:20.592
Like Lenny!
He'd go great
with wild rice!

06:20.676 --> 06:23.511
Oh, don't be such
a nervous Pervis.

06:23.596 --> 06:27.807
That's not a real skeleton,
it's a Halloween costume.

06:27.892 --> 06:29.184
But what about the ax?

06:29.268 --> 06:31.102
Oh, don't be silly.

06:31.187 --> 06:33.146
I just use that
to chop through

06:33.230 --> 06:36.024
those tough Meals
on Wheels steaks.

06:38.694 --> 06:42.572
Oh, I couldn't
possibly eat all this.

06:42.656 --> 06:44.365
Please join me.

06:44.450 --> 06:45.992
You're the shut-in.

06:47.870 --> 06:50.288
So I threw
the SuperBall so hard

06:50.372 --> 06:53.541
it hit the ceiling twice,
then broke a lamp!

06:55.252 --> 07:00.048
Oh, Homer, I feel like
I'm talking to Bennett Cerf.

07:00.508 --> 07:04.052
Yeah, I've gotten a lot of
compliments about my talking.

07:04.136 --> 07:09.015
Before you go,
would you mind opening
this jar of butter pickles?

07:09.100 --> 07:10.683
My pleasure.

07:16.107 --> 07:20.777
Oh, my.
You're as strong
as you are handsome.

07:20.861 --> 07:22.779
And I can ride
my bike real fast.

07:22.905 --> 07:24.823
Aren't you a wonder?

07:25.199 --> 07:29.953
Can I call you
the next time I need
a muscular he-man?

07:30.037 --> 07:32.956
Hey!
I'm not running an employment
service, you old...

07:33.040 --> 07:37.210
Oh, you mean me?
I'd be delighted.

07:39.421 --> 07:41.965
Yello? Hi, Mrs. Bellamy.

07:42.508 --> 07:45.593
No, I'm not doing anything.
I can mow your lawn.

07:46.387 --> 07:47.887
Cover for me.

08:08.242 --> 08:10.326
Hello? Uh-huh.

08:10.411 --> 08:13.163
Yes, Mrs. Bellamy.
I'll be right there.

08:14.206 --> 08:16.082
That woman is
taking advantage of you.

08:16.167 --> 08:18.459
And we need you to do
things around here.

08:18.544 --> 08:19.586
The oven light is out.

08:19.670 --> 08:21.754
And you never finished
filling up the aquarium.

08:25.301 --> 08:28.428
Marge, I can't say no
to a helpless old lady.

08:28.512 --> 08:30.513
They put spells on you!

08:30.598 --> 08:32.599
Fine. I'll go talk to her.

08:32.933 --> 08:36.352
Homer's family
needs him, too.
And that's that!

08:36.770 --> 08:39.647
Oh, Marge,
you're such a good woman

08:39.732 --> 08:42.192
to care so much
about your husband.

08:42.275 --> 08:48.323
All I have left
of my Chester is his
tattered old Army jacket.

08:49.783 --> 08:52.035
Let me sew that
up for you.

08:52.119 --> 08:54.204
Make sure
you double stitch.

08:54.288 --> 08:56.122
Then do these socks.

08:57.208 --> 09:00.835
Darn her socks?
I say darn her!

09:01.295 --> 09:03.963
I'll do them and
then I'm out of here.

09:07.927 --> 09:14.015
Did you hear that
Gertie had a terrible fall
outside the thrift store?

09:14.099 --> 09:16.559
Oh! She would fall there!

09:19.104 --> 09:22.565
Hey, who do I have to
gum to get a refill?

09:25.611 --> 09:28.112
Freshen your drinks,
ladies?

09:28.989 --> 09:30.365
Laxative?

09:30.491 --> 09:31.866
Yeah.

09:32.993 --> 09:35.828
Mother,
may I read a magazine
while I wait in the car?

09:35.913 --> 09:39.123
Don't you read enough
at school, bookworm?

09:44.880 --> 09:47.340
I am so sick of
doing her dirty work.

09:47.424 --> 09:50.009
She's taking
advantage of us, Homer!

09:50.177 --> 09:52.929
The Missus prefers
you call me Simpson.

09:54.098 --> 09:56.432
She's got a set
of lungs on her.

09:59.228 --> 10:00.937
Are you all right?

10:02.022 --> 10:05.858
That man took my
diamond necklace.

10:09.029 --> 10:11.864
Don't worry.
You're gonna
be just fine.

10:13.450 --> 10:15.702
Okay.

10:18.622 --> 10:20.581
Oh, my gosh.
She's dead!

10:28.924 --> 10:30.258
So let me get this straight.

10:30.342 --> 10:33.303
This mysterious man
with braces

10:33.387 --> 10:36.389
just stabbed the old lady
and disappeared?

10:36.598 --> 10:38.224
Without a trace.

10:38.726 --> 10:40.268
Found her will, Chief.

10:40.352 --> 10:44.397
It was just changed
to leave the Simpsons
$50,000.

10:45.065 --> 10:47.066
So it's a good
thing she died,

10:47.151 --> 10:49.652
from our point of view,
financially.

10:49.737 --> 10:52.405
Well,
I'd like to thank you both
for cooperating with...

10:52.489 --> 10:53.489
Did you do it?

10:53.574 --> 10:56.784
Chief Wiggum!
Homer and I are innocent!

10:56.869 --> 10:58.328
I'm sorry, Marge.

10:58.412 --> 11:01.205
I can't believe
I tried to trick you
with such an...

11:01.290 --> 11:03.082
Did you do it?
No!

11:03.167 --> 11:05.043
Now if you'll excuse us,
we'll just be...

11:05.127 --> 11:06.210
Does that ever work?

11:06.295 --> 11:08.212
No. No, never does.

11:08.297 --> 11:09.505
Book him, Lou.

11:09.590 --> 11:12.842
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.
I'll be back on the streets
by dinnertime.

11:12.926 --> 11:14.302
You'll see.

11:15.220 --> 11:18.348
And the elephant that
couldn't stop laughing
was put to death.

11:18.432 --> 11:19.432
Speaking of death,

11:19.516 --> 11:22.727
octogenarian Myrna Bellamy
was brutally murdered
last night.

11:22.811 --> 11:26.731
The top suspects,
her disgruntled servants,
Homer and Marge Simpson.

11:26.815 --> 11:27.815
Hmm?

11:27.941 --> 11:29.400
Top suspects?

11:29.526 --> 11:33.112
Oh, dear.
Now everyone will think
Homer and I did it.

11:33.447 --> 11:36.574
The real killer is
the man with the braces.

11:36.658 --> 11:39.285
Yeah.
If Dad killed everyone
he talked about killing,

11:39.370 --> 11:40.828
would any of us be here?

11:40.913 --> 11:43.164
You'd be dead
a million times.

11:45.584 --> 11:47.710
Do you really think
Homer could be a killer?

11:47.795 --> 11:51.130
I just can't believe
a man we sat and drank
with all these years

11:51.215 --> 11:52.840
could do such
a horrible thing.

11:52.925 --> 11:55.551
Well, we've all got
that voice in our heads
telling us to kill.

11:55.636 --> 11:57.595
You just have
to drown it out.

11:57.679 --> 12:01.057
I've been
working on the railroad
all the livelong day

12:01.141 --> 12:02.392
Yeah, that's better.

12:02.476 --> 12:05.645
Oh, man. What a day!
I'd kill for a beer.

12:07.815 --> 12:10.650
Right away, sir.
I don't want no trouble.

12:12.319 --> 12:13.403
Mmm.

12:13.487 --> 12:16.155
I'd stab somebody
for a pickle.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.118
Give me some peanuts.

12:20.494 --> 12:22.662
You didn't say
you'd kill me.

12:22.830 --> 12:25.498
I'll kill you if you don't
give me some peanuts.

12:25.582 --> 12:27.083
Here you go, mister.

12:31.171 --> 12:35.299
Today's readings
come from Matthew,
Mark, Luke, and John.

12:36.844 --> 12:39.137
Well, maybe just
Matthew and Mark.

12:41.181 --> 12:42.348
Amen!

12:47.855 --> 12:50.064
Next on the
Springfield Death Tour

12:50.149 --> 12:53.067
is the home of Marge
and Homer Simpson,

12:53.152 --> 12:56.654
also known as "H-Diddy
and his Murder Ho. "

12:57.906 --> 12:59.198
Go away!

13:00.659 --> 13:04.036
Wait, wait!
That's a suggestion,
not a threat.

13:07.207 --> 13:08.541
Homer!

13:08.625 --> 13:10.918
What? It goes
right by our house.

13:16.592 --> 13:17.800
This is ridiculous.

13:17.885 --> 13:19.927
You've been through
my delicates, my silkies,

13:20.012 --> 13:22.805
my dainties,
and my unmentionables!

13:22.890 --> 13:26.309
I insist on
searching every inch
of this home personally.

13:26.393 --> 13:28.478
Here's my underwear drawer.

13:28.562 --> 13:29.770
Where's that robot?

13:29.855 --> 13:31.522
Hey, Chief.
You better get in here.

13:35.402 --> 13:37.028
Mrs. Bellamy's necklace!

13:37.112 --> 13:38.571
Homer and Marge Simpson,

13:38.655 --> 13:41.824
you're under arrest for
the murder of Myrna Bellamy.

13:42.743 --> 13:45.077
Homer,
what are we going to do?

13:45.496 --> 13:47.538
You know, Chief,
if you let us go,

13:47.623 --> 13:50.082
there's a diamond
necklace in it for you.

13:50.167 --> 13:51.751
I hope you're
not suggesting

13:51.835 --> 13:54.462
that I would take that
necklace as a bribe.

13:54.546 --> 13:56.214
Think again, dirtbag.

13:56.298 --> 13:59.425
Because I can
just swipe it later
from the evidence locker!

14:04.056 --> 14:05.681
Yeah, your wife's gonna look
pretty good in that, Chief.

14:05.766 --> 14:07.767
Yeah. She's a super lady.

14:15.400 --> 14:18.986
I can't believe
we've been arrested
for murder.

14:19.238 --> 14:20.279
Don't worry, Marge.

14:20.364 --> 14:23.533
I'll cut us
a deal by becoming
a jailhouse snitch.

14:23.617 --> 14:26.035
I know who
stopped up the toilet.

14:28.956 --> 14:33.209
Now don't worry, kids.
You'll be placed with
a caring foster family.

14:33.919 --> 14:36.837
Young'uns, meet your new
brother and sister.

14:37.422 --> 14:40.383
They's worth five dollars
a day county money.

14:40.467 --> 14:42.593
I'm Bart.
And this is Lisa.

14:42.678 --> 14:44.387
Them's city names.

14:44.471 --> 14:50.059
From now on,
you're Dingus Squatford Jr.
and Pamela E. Lee.

14:50.143 --> 14:51.852
But I like my old name.

14:51.937 --> 14:53.271
You hush up, Dingus!

14:55.524 --> 14:57.358
They hated the victim.

14:57.442 --> 15:00.403
Her death earned
them $50,000.

15:00.487 --> 15:03.364
And the necklace was
found in their home.

15:03.448 --> 15:05.241
Does the defense have
any closing remarks?

15:05.325 --> 15:07.368
Well, not at this time,
Your Honor.

15:07.452 --> 15:08.452
This is the only time.

15:08.537 --> 15:10.329
Well, then no.

15:15.794 --> 15:18.254
Mr. Foreman,
have you reached
a verdict?

15:18.338 --> 15:21.340
Verdict? Is that what
we were supposed to do?

15:22.509 --> 15:24.093
Well, in all my
years on the bench...

15:24.177 --> 15:26.220
'Cause that's what we did!

15:27.055 --> 15:30.224
You juries.
Gonna be the...

15:30.309 --> 15:31.892
How do you find?

15:34.354 --> 15:36.606
We find
the defendants guilty.

15:38.275 --> 15:40.109
Homer and Marge Simpson,

15:40.193 --> 15:44.030
I sentence you to death
in the electric chair!

15:45.866 --> 15:49.827
But we're innocent!
It was the man
with the braces!

15:49.953 --> 15:53.873
Can't you do anything?
Surprise witnesses?
Evidence tampering?

15:53.957 --> 15:56.876
Play the race card!
Play it!

16:01.590 --> 16:06.093
We appreciate your
coming to comfort us.
But we're not Catholic.

16:06.261 --> 16:07.637
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

16:07.721 --> 16:10.723
Well, then I hope you enjoy
your stay in hell.

16:13.644 --> 16:15.061
Nice dress.

16:15.145 --> 16:17.688
Oh, go home and have
sex with your wife!

16:17.773 --> 16:19.732
That's it. Bring it on!

16:19.900 --> 16:21.525
Why you little...

16:25.238 --> 16:26.447
Come on, you sainted...

16:34.915 --> 16:38.084
How can you have
such an appetite
at a time like this?

16:38.168 --> 16:42.505
Let's just say
I'm planning a little
surprise for the execution.

16:43.090 --> 16:46.175
This cannon is gonna
be full when I go off.

16:46.259 --> 16:47.593
Ka-boom!

16:47.678 --> 16:50.680
You know,
this is our last night

16:50.764 --> 16:53.724
and our cells
are side by side.

16:54.518 --> 16:56.519
It's hard to get
in the mood

16:56.603 --> 16:59.605
with all those
murderous eyes
staring at us.

16:59.690 --> 17:02.525
Just think of them
as twinkling stars.

17:03.652 --> 17:05.694
Homie, I'm sorry.
I can't.

17:06.195 --> 17:09.699
I just keep thinking about
everything we're gonna miss.

17:10.325 --> 17:14.203
The kids growing up.
Grandchildren.

17:17.290 --> 17:21.711
I want to confess.
I killed and robbed
the old lady all by myself.

17:21.795 --> 17:23.713
Marge is completely innocent.

17:23.797 --> 17:26.715
The only thing
she's guilty of
is loving too much.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.467
The murder I did.

17:32.305 --> 17:34.515
Congratulations,
Mrs. Simpson.

17:34.599 --> 17:38.102
Your husband
confessed to everything.
You're free to go.

17:39.104 --> 17:42.940
Oh, my love.
You saved my life.

17:43.150 --> 17:45.317
Now you do it for me.

17:53.243 --> 17:55.786
Dead man walking
on the green mile!

18:01.668 --> 18:03.669
Give me your hands, boss.

18:05.380 --> 18:06.422
I'll kill you!

18:06.506 --> 18:09.759
I killed them other people,
and I'll kill you, too!

18:10.469 --> 18:13.429
You want some cornbread,
Mr. Jingles?

18:14.639 --> 18:16.098
Well, you can forget it.

18:16.183 --> 18:17.725
Because I'm gonna kill you!

18:35.744 --> 18:37.119
Hello?

18:37.370 --> 18:39.079
Yes, Governor!

18:39.748 --> 18:42.082
No, Governor.
It's not too late.

18:42.292 --> 18:45.211
Yes, Governor.
I'll tell him right away.

18:46.213 --> 18:49.298
The governor says he hopes
you're a twitcher!

18:49.382 --> 18:50.925
Oh, yes!

18:51.009 --> 18:53.135
Oh.
Chin up, Homer.

18:53.220 --> 18:56.222
We've gotta put
an electrode there
to ground the brain stem.

18:56.306 --> 18:57.681
Thank you.

19:02.896 --> 19:04.438
Goodbye, Marge.

19:04.523 --> 19:07.149
I'll always love you.

19:11.404 --> 19:13.155
You're on Frame Up!

19:14.866 --> 19:15.991
That's right.

19:16.076 --> 19:17.993
Homer Simpson,
you're the latest victim

19:18.078 --> 19:20.830
of the new reality show,
Frame Up!

19:21.498 --> 19:24.041
It's the man
with the braces!

19:24.125 --> 19:27.920
I'm also your host.
Now let's meet a ghost.

19:29.422 --> 19:31.340
Mrs. Bellamy?

19:31.424 --> 19:34.093
There never was
a Mrs. Bellamy.

19:34.845 --> 19:37.555
Only me,
Carmen Electra!

19:37.764 --> 19:39.014
I knew it!

19:39.099 --> 19:40.891
And I'm some
actor they hired!

19:40.976 --> 19:43.686
Frame Up is
Fox's latest hit,

19:43.770 --> 19:47.481
right after
No Pants Island
and Fart Date!

19:47.566 --> 19:49.900
This whole thing
was a joke?

19:50.777 --> 19:53.070
I've never been
so relieved!

19:53.154 --> 19:55.447
Relieved and angry.

19:55.532 --> 19:56.532
So wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

19:56.616 --> 19:58.367
You tied up
the judicial system,

19:58.451 --> 20:00.536
costing the city
millions of dollars,

20:00.620 --> 20:02.204
just for a TV show?

20:02.289 --> 20:03.330
Yes.

20:03.415 --> 20:04.748
And I'm gonna be
in the show?

20:04.833 --> 20:05.833
Yes!

20:05.959 --> 20:08.544
Can Eddy and Lou
have producer credits?
Yup!

20:08.628 --> 20:10.296
Now what are
your last names?

20:10.380 --> 20:12.798
We don't have them.
We're like Cher.

20:13.258 --> 20:16.886
Oh, Homie.
I'm so lucky
to be married

20:16.970 --> 20:19.889
to such a selfless
and loving man.

20:22.142 --> 20:24.727
Mom, Dad!
Thank God you're okay!

20:24.811 --> 20:27.855
We were in the greenroom.
I had so much shrimp.

20:28.231 --> 20:30.941
Well, I'm glad
everyone's all right.

20:31.026 --> 20:33.193
But I think you
should be ashamed.

20:33.278 --> 20:36.030
Toying with a human life
for TV ratings.

20:36.114 --> 20:38.657
Uh, Homer.
My face is up here.

20:38.992 --> 20:40.743
I've made my choice.
