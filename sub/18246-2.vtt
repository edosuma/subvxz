Episode 2: Bunk Off

00:21.721 --> 00:22.919
<i>The local park,</i>

00:23.080 --> 00:24.714
<i>where people come to play football,</i>

00:24.834 --> 00:26.232
<i>hang out with their friends,</i>

00:26.352 --> 00:28.799
<i>and most importantly,
let their dogs shit.</i>

00:30.523 --> 00:32.149
<i>It's not a cool place, admittedly,</i>

00:32.269 --> 00:34.213
<i>but it is a good place
to stare at girls.</i>

00:34.333 --> 00:37.213
<i>If anything's worth braving
this dogshit minefield for,</i>

00:37.333 --> 00:38.883
<i>it's staring at girls.</i>

00:39.080 --> 00:41.359
You lot are gay.
Why aren't we playing football?

00:41.778 --> 00:44.089
Chasing men around a field
with your top off,

00:44.209 --> 00:46.240
- what's more gay than that?
- You.

00:46.400 --> 00:49.445
Brilliant. Anyway, we're playing
Frisbee because girls can join in.

00:49.565 --> 00:50.535
Trust me,

00:50.655 --> 00:54.400
- girls love this.
- Border collies love this.

00:54.561 --> 00:58.311
You're too scared in case Donovan
joins in and breaks your legs.

00:58.893 --> 01:01.334
- That's not true.
- Oh, my God...

01:01.645 --> 01:03.399
Check out the Jugasaurus Rex!

01:07.240 --> 01:11.207
- Shit! And it's Carli.
- Perfect. Watch this.

01:11.794 --> 01:12.600
Carli!

01:14.020 --> 01:15.728
Carli! Catch!

01:25.347 --> 01:26.345
Oh, fuck.

01:29.410 --> 01:30.839
Oh, my God. I'm sorry!

01:31.335 --> 01:32.519
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:33.525 --> 01:36.243
I'm really sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.

01:45.232 --> 01:47.400
So as I say, I'm sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.

01:47.738 --> 01:50.591
It's fine.
You've apologised 30 times. Come on.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.905
I'm going to get my Frisbee.

01:57.414 --> 02:00.215
Those wankers are nicking
that girl's Frisbee.

02:00.335 --> 02:01.585
It's my Frisbee!

02:02.123 --> 02:03.658
I've got a receipt!

02:04.706 --> 02:06.326
I've got a receipt!

02:07.281 --> 02:10.720
<i>So, in what I can only describe
as an attack of Frisbee rage,</i>

02:10.880 --> 02:13.610
<i>once again we were running from Donovan.</i>

02:13.730 --> 02:14.702
All right?

02:15.418 --> 02:17.250
- Not really.
- What's up?

02:17.370 --> 02:20.274
Think, Neil. Last time you saw us,
before you legged it,

02:20.394 --> 02:22.639
a Frisbee was heading
to a disabled girl's face.

02:23.133 --> 02:25.319
- Did it hit her in the face then?
- Bingo!

02:25.480 --> 02:27.341
Was the girl in the wheelchair
all right?

02:27.461 --> 02:29.680
I've *** about it.
I've lost my Frisbee Aero B Pro.

02:29.840 --> 02:32.485
- Is the gayest sentence ever.
- That's it.

02:32.605 --> 02:34.399
- We can't bunk off tomorrow now.
- Why?

02:34.729 --> 02:37.199
It's bad karma, innit?
For hitting a spastic.

02:37.361 --> 02:40.119
- It could be a sign.
- That you've shit your pants?

02:40.462 --> 02:42.879
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- To wank over your mum's bras?

02:44.152 --> 02:47.199
- As she's my mum? Probably not!
- Oh, good, can I have them then?

02:47.361 --> 02:49.011
No. But you can have...

02:49.804 --> 02:50.560
that.

02:51.056 --> 02:53.745
And that. See you tomorrow.

02:53.865 --> 02:54.635
See you.

02:54.755 --> 02:57.356
<i>I'd only been in state education
a month and yet,</i>

02:57.476 --> 02:59.646
<i>I found myself ready to break the law.</i>

02:59.766 --> 03:01.246
<i>Okay, it was the truancy law,</i>

03:01.366 --> 03:03.639
<i>but it was still the worst
thing I'd ever done.</i>

03:04.022 --> 03:05.272
Hello, William.

03:05.392 --> 03:07.206
Hello, Mrs Cooper. Is Simon in?

03:07.326 --> 03:09.440
Yes. Unless he ran away
in the middle of the night...

03:09.600 --> 03:12.560
- Simon!
- Yes, all right. Will, come in.

03:15.526 --> 03:16.879
Why aren't you in uniform?

03:19.680 --> 03:21.839
We're sorry,
Mrs Cooper, it was Jay's idea...

03:21.959 --> 03:24.150
We forgot to tell you
it was a non-uniform day.

03:24.270 --> 03:26.800
- No, it's not. Bye.
- Yes, it is.

03:27.428 --> 03:29.919
For Years 12 and 13.
It is, you little shit!

03:30.375 --> 03:33.828
Right, so it's a Year 12
non-uniform day?

03:35.897 --> 03:37.962
For Christ's sake, Simon, you're 17 now

03:38.082 --> 03:39.889
and I don't want to play
these stupid games.

03:40.009 --> 03:41.759
It's a bloody non-uniform day, allright?

03:41.920 --> 03:44.400
I don't believe you. Will?

03:46.127 --> 03:47.599
Yes, it's a non-uniform day.

03:48.675 --> 03:50.753
- See?
- Fine. Fine.

03:51.761 --> 03:54.319
But if you've lied to me
I won't be angry,

03:54.481 --> 03:56.960
I will be really, really disappointed.

04:05.457 --> 04:07.931
How stupid is she
that she totally believed us?

04:08.051 --> 04:09.396
- That's my mum.
- Sorry,

04:09.516 --> 04:12.346
did you see the way I just lied to her?
I totally did it.

04:12.466 --> 04:13.922
We're bunking off.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.185
- Who are you calling?
- School.

04:16.305 --> 04:19.307
I'll just say we're ill
and won't be in today.

04:19.427 --> 04:20.991
No, really. Who are you calling?

04:21.111 --> 04:23.947
Don't shit your pants. I'm only phoning
the school secretary, not fucking MI5.

04:24.067 --> 04:26.660
Hello,
this is Mrs Cooper, Simon's mother.

04:26.780 --> 04:29.134
Simon and Will MacKenzie
have food poisoning.

04:29.254 --> 04:31.879
- Must have been after the chicken.
- You're putting on your mum's voice?

04:31.999 --> 04:35.152
I'm sorry.
Mrs Cooper, you say your son is ill?

04:35.272 --> 04:37.967
Well, Mr Gilbert,
the Head of Sixth is just here.

04:38.087 --> 04:41.137
- I'll pass him over.
- No, there's really no need.

04:41.320 --> 04:43.039
We can still make it for English!

04:44.020 --> 04:44.971
Hello?

04:45.502 --> 04:49.215
This is Mrs Cooper, Simon
and his friend Will are ill, goodbye.

04:49.335 --> 04:50.925
<i>- Mrs Cooper?
- Yes?</i>

04:51.320 --> 04:54.021
- What exactly is wrong with Simon?
- Food poisoning.

04:54.141 --> 04:56.526
OK, Simon, that's enough,
I know you're bullshitting me.

04:56.646 --> 04:59.132
<i>- I think you'd better get to school.
- Cheers. All the best.</i>

04:59.252 --> 05:01.122
<i>Get in before you make me...</i>

05:02.226 --> 05:04.920
Well, that was fucking dreadful.

05:06.107 --> 05:09.359
- I think he bought it though.
- In what way did he buy it?

05:09.825 --> 05:12.140
I think he thought that was my mum.

05:13.620 --> 05:15.775
<i>So with our terrible alibi in place,</i>

05:15.895 --> 05:18.496
<i>phase two of the plan was
how to get some booze.</i>

05:18.616 --> 05:21.679
You look like you're on day release.
They'll never serve you.

05:22.273 --> 05:24.402
- What about this one?
- No, not one of this suits.

05:24.522 --> 05:26.840
- He'll go mental if he finds out.
- Shirts.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.640
- Not the suit.
- Yes!

05:28.801 --> 05:29.951
Not the suit.

05:30.071 --> 05:33.651
<i>And so in Simon's dad's suit,
and looking a bit like a Hasidic Jew,</i>

05:33.771 --> 05:35.519
<i>we headed for the off-licence.</i>

05:37.109 --> 05:40.660
- What are you wearing?
- The suit's my dad's. He insisted.

05:41.113 --> 05:43.360
- The hat's his though.
- What a bell end!

05:43.520 --> 05:45.775
I'm just an adult man
stocking up on booze.

05:45.895 --> 05:47.919
This'll work. £10 each, please.

05:50.157 --> 05:52.447
And as none of you offered to do it,
you can fuck off.

05:52.567 --> 05:53.680
- What?
- Nothing.

05:53.800 --> 05:55.089
<i>Unlike those morons,</i>

05:55.209 --> 05:57.479
<i>I knew the key to getting served
was confidence.</i>

05:59.958 --> 06:01.652
- Good day.
- Sorry?

06:03.675 --> 06:04.560
Good day.

06:06.740 --> 06:07.440
Hello.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.287
- Oh, shit.
- What?

06:14.021 --> 06:15.031
Nothing.

06:15.647 --> 06:19.423
- It's Carli's mum, innit?
- Jay, don't. She'll recognise me.

06:19.543 --> 06:21.279
He wants to suck your Carli's tits!

06:23.656 --> 06:24.877
Unbelievable.

06:26.239 --> 06:29.091
<i>The key is to let the shop owner
know who's in control.</i>

06:29.211 --> 06:30.639
<i>It like a Jedi mind trick.</i>

06:31.018 --> 06:32.234
<i>I am an adult.</i>

06:32.662 --> 06:34.060
<i>You will serve me.</i>

06:34.440 --> 06:35.936
Can I help at all?

06:36.139 --> 06:40.089
Yes, I am a man who has recently
bought a house

06:40.209 --> 06:43.337
in the local area and I'm having
a house-warming party

06:43.457 --> 06:46.607
to which I'll be inviting
a lot of the local adults.

06:48.985 --> 06:50.653
- Hence the crisps.
- Yeah.

06:53.294 --> 06:55.560
I'll also probably need some...

06:57.576 --> 06:58.968
alcohol as well.

06:59.696 --> 07:02.399
- As well as the crisps, et cetera...
- What are you looking for?

07:04.322 --> 07:07.541
Some Beefeater gin.

07:09.708 --> 07:11.959
- How about two bottles?
- Excellent.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.439
- Some wine?
- Christ! We're not made of money!

07:14.600 --> 07:17.484
And I'll have some extra-strong mints.

07:18.561 --> 07:20.839
- For those who are drink-driving.
- Right...

07:21.159 --> 07:24.800
- That comes to £29.50. Anything else?
- What's on special?

07:25.081 --> 07:27.217
A bottle of Drambuie for a tenner

07:27.337 --> 07:29.601
if you are out of the shop
in five seconds.

07:29.721 --> 07:31.938
Done. My good man.

07:32.971 --> 07:34.759
I shall invite you to the party.

07:40.429 --> 07:42.716
- Mission accomplished.
- What's in all the bags then?

07:42.836 --> 07:44.986
Something to soak up the alcohol.

07:45.282 --> 07:47.216
- Crisps?
- Where's the beer?

07:47.336 --> 07:50.153
Have you spent all our money
on fucking crisps?

07:50.273 --> 07:52.523
- You twat.
- What the fuck's this?

07:52.750 --> 07:54.783
- Drambuie.
- What's Drambuie?

07:54.903 --> 07:57.159
- Whisky-based liqueur.
- What's a liqueur?

07:57.320 --> 07:59.716
- A bender's drink.
- Why have we got that?

07:59.836 --> 08:02.839
- It's your dad's favourite drink.
- My dad's not bent.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.215
- He is a bit though.
- He's fucking not.

08:05.335 --> 08:08.759
The evidence: one,
your mum left him because he loves cock.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.944
No, she was in a difficult place!

08:11.064 --> 08:13.528
- In bed with a bender.
- Your dad, who is a bender.

08:13.648 --> 08:16.199
Two, he wears tight denim shorts
to do the gardening.

08:16.360 --> 08:18.653
The only night he goes out
all week is Wednesday

08:18.773 --> 08:20.753
and that's to play badminton!

08:21.611 --> 08:24.253
My dad's not bent because
he's got porn mags at home

08:24.373 --> 08:26.259
- and it's all straight.
- All straight?

08:26.379 --> 08:27.382
Some lesbian.

08:27.502 --> 08:30.303
- We should go and have a look.
- Fine, come on then.

08:30.423 --> 08:33.119
- This should be good.
- I bet it's 90% cock.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.399
They must be around here somewhere.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.264
I don't know where they could have gone.

08:40.384 --> 08:42.150
Maybe he swapped them
for an Abba boxset.

08:42.270 --> 08:45.120
He probably
shoved them up his arse. Drink!

08:49.888 --> 08:53.712
- What we gonna do today then?
- Anything we fucking well please.

08:54.068 --> 08:56.545
- Specifically, what?
- We could get some birds.

08:56.665 --> 08:58.390
Let's get some girls. Great.

08:58.510 --> 09:00.214
- Where are all the girls?
- At school.

09:00.334 --> 09:01.759
We'll wait for them to get out.

09:01.920 --> 09:04.709
We're not doing anything until half
three? We could have gone to school.

09:04.829 --> 09:07.000
We can't fucking do this. Drink!

09:10.014 --> 09:11.199
Hello, Mrs Cooper?

09:11.587 --> 09:13.216
Sorry to bother you at work.

09:13.336 --> 09:15.599
This is Mr Gilbert,
Simon's Head of Sixth.

09:18.320 --> 09:20.046
Your mum is so fit, Will,

09:20.166 --> 09:22.319
- I reckon she could be a prostitute.
- Thanks...

09:22.480 --> 09:24.073
Have you wanked over Will's mum.

09:24.193 --> 09:26.240
No. Not yet.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.359
Please don't have a wank over my mum.

09:28.773 --> 09:30.399
I can't promise that, I'm afraid.

09:30.560 --> 09:33.218
Yes, hello.
Is that Mrs MacKenzie, William's mother?

09:33.338 --> 09:35.399
Right.
Can I just check something with you?

09:35.560 --> 09:36.999
When we're with the Caravan Club

09:37.160 --> 09:40.559
there's this bird and her sister
who I've shagged for two years.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.719
Sometimes I get them
to strum themselves while I watch.

09:44.805 --> 09:47.239
Sorry, did you say
you go on holiday in a caravan?

09:47.400 --> 09:50.079
- With the Caravan Club.
- In a caravan like a gypo?

09:50.274 --> 09:52.599
If my mum told me
we were going caravanning

09:52.761 --> 09:54.119
I'd call Childline.

09:54.730 --> 09:58.194
It's a sense of freedom
you don't get with other holidays.

09:58.314 --> 10:00.461
It's a sense of shitting
in a bucket in a cupboard

10:00.581 --> 10:03.680
you don't get with other holidays,
in England, with your parents.

10:03.840 --> 10:06.030
Actually, it's a well-known fact

10:06.150 --> 10:08.799
that the Caravan Club is like a sex club
all over Europe,

10:08.961 --> 10:12.092
which is why I've lost my cherry
and none of you sad acts have.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.439
- I could have got laid loads!
- No, you couldn't.

10:14.601 --> 10:16.994
Yeah, I could. But I want to lose it
with someone I love.

10:17.114 --> 10:18.840
What? Like Carli?

10:19.525 --> 10:21.151
Maybe I do love Carli.

10:21.271 --> 10:24.280
She's gorgeous,
she's smart, she's amazing.

10:24.440 --> 10:26.139
Worth mentioning to her then, mate,

10:26.259 --> 10:28.879
- if that's the way you feel.
- Yeah, why not mention it?

10:29.173 --> 10:30.919
Worse that can happen you get nothing.

10:31.085 --> 10:33.679
Best that can happen,
you get stinky fingers.

10:33.840 --> 10:34.919
You really are

10:35.080 --> 10:38.079
one of the most disgusting humans
I've ever met.

10:38.591 --> 10:39.639
Look out.

10:39.759 --> 10:42.168
Prince Harry's had a few drinks
and now he thinks he's hard!

10:42.288 --> 10:44.279
- I am hard.
- Scared of teachers

10:44.399 --> 10:47.079
and brown-nosing everyone's parents
is just an act?

10:47.240 --> 10:49.639
- I don't brown-nose anyone!
- You do a bit.

10:49.902 --> 10:52.959
- Good manners cost nothing.
- A good shag costs nothing!

10:53.120 --> 10:54.639
A good shag with Carli.

10:55.521 --> 10:58.015
<i># Carli's fanny on your face,
on your face #</i>

10:58.135 --> 10:59.679
<i># Carli's fanny on your face! #</i>

11:00.338 --> 11:03.388
I keep catching myself on it.
It's a bloody menace.

11:03.901 --> 11:05.319
Hang on, I think someone's in.

11:05.480 --> 11:07.262
<i># And your bell end #</i>

11:07.382 --> 11:09.826
<i># Carli's fanny on your face,
on your face... #</i>

11:09.946 --> 11:13.040
Neil! What the hell is going on?

11:13.572 --> 11:16.798
This place smells like a brewery
and not a nice one.

11:16.918 --> 11:19.039
Jay, there is always trouble
when you're around,

11:19.465 --> 11:22.313
but Will, I'm especially
surprised at you... So sorry, Steve.

11:22.433 --> 11:24.600
Oh, piss off!

11:24.760 --> 11:25.695
What?

11:26.058 --> 11:28.399
Don't talk to me like that
in my own house!

11:28.852 --> 11:32.840
Oh, I'm so sorry, my manners.
Piss off, please.

11:33.198 --> 11:35.959
- I've had enough of your lip.
- You'd like my lip, wouldn't you?

11:36.147 --> 11:39.559
Right round your bell end,
if Mr Chippy doesn't get there first.

11:39.968 --> 11:41.119
What's he knocking up?

11:41.280 --> 11:44.560
A closet for you to hide in, you bumder?

11:53.237 --> 11:56.387
<i>In hindsight,
I might have taken it a bit too far.</i>

11:56.929 --> 11:57.961
Amazing!

11:58.937 --> 12:00.674
Jesus Christ. "Bumder"?!

12:01.779 --> 12:03.903
Fair play to you,
that was pretty special.

12:04.023 --> 12:04.877
"Bumder"!

12:04.997 --> 12:06.905
It's a mixture of "bummer" and "bender".

12:07.025 --> 12:08.775
He'll be all right about it, though.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.476
He can take a joke.

12:11.339 --> 12:14.885
- That was taken as a joke.
- "My lips around your bell end"?

12:15.005 --> 12:17.490
- Yeah, it should be fine!
- I love Carli.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.004
I love Carli.

12:20.715 --> 12:23.199
Shit, I've got to tell her.
What if she feels the same?

12:23.360 --> 12:26.239
- Seems fairly unlikely.
- Life is about these moments.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.296
It's the things you don't do you regret.

12:28.416 --> 12:31.290
It's the {kind of }cavalier philosophy that caused
my father to leave my mother.

12:31.410 --> 12:32.814
- You go for it.
- Bumder.

12:32.934 --> 12:34.960
<i>And so we headed for Carli's house.</i>

12:36.114 --> 12:38.559
I feel a bit stupid doing this.
This is fine, isn't it?

12:38.721 --> 12:40.640
Yeah. Definitely.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.606
You would tell me if I was being a dick?

12:42.726 --> 12:44.519
- Of course I would.
- Yeah, yeah.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.887
Writing her surname
is particularly important.

12:47.007 --> 12:50.700
It's her drive, but you wouldn't want
Carli-based confusion.

12:50.820 --> 12:53.379
If you put a kiss, she'll suck you off.

12:53.499 --> 12:55.599
- What the fuck is that?
- What?

12:55.760 --> 12:57.719
Simon, why are you vandalising my drive?

12:59.502 --> 13:01.399
What does it say? You love me?

13:02.038 --> 13:02.800
Look.

13:03.274 --> 13:04.655
I can easily wash it off

13:04.775 --> 13:06.539
and we can just pretend
it never happened

13:06.659 --> 13:09.239
and I could not tell anyone
and you could not tell anyone

13:09.401 --> 13:12.359
and my mates could not tell anyone
and your mates could not tell anyone.

13:12.858 --> 13:15.359
Simon, we've known each other
for ages. Why now?

13:16.256 --> 13:17.480
We were playing dares.

13:17.834 --> 13:21.032
Did someone dare you to be
the world's biggest saddo?

13:21.321 --> 13:23.482
So what? You are in love with me?

13:23.602 --> 13:26.040
This couldn't have gone any better.

13:27.106 --> 13:29.469
Actually I think this is pretty cool,
Simon.

13:29.589 --> 13:31.679
Sort of artistic.
It's like Banksy or someone.

13:32.525 --> 13:35.160
Why don't you come over to mine tonight,
I'm baby-sitting my brother,

13:35.320 --> 13:37.465
- and we can sort this out?
- Really?

13:37.585 --> 13:40.714
Yeah, come round about eight.
My folks will be out by then.

13:40.834 --> 13:42.919
Best to avoid them
until this has washed away.

13:44.236 --> 13:47.399
- I'm not sure this washes away...
- Whatever. See you later.

13:49.438 --> 13:50.317
Yes!

13:50.760 --> 13:53.593
Incredibly,
I think you might be in there.

13:53.713 --> 13:55.683
Of course he is.
She's wet for you, mate.

13:55.803 --> 13:57.609
I can't believe it worked.

13:57.729 --> 14:00.279
Maybe, she was impressed
by your artistic side.

14:00.399 --> 14:03.033
- No, it's because you're drunk.
- Do you think so?

14:03.153 --> 14:06.900
Yes, it's because you're wasted.
Like Pete Doherty? Girls love it.

14:07.020 --> 14:10.839
- I think Pete Doherty is on heroin.
- I'm not sure I should do heroin!

14:11.249 --> 14:14.153
Right, vodka, whisky,
and a load of creme de menthe.

14:14.273 --> 14:16.844
When she sees you,
she'll be frothing at the gash.

14:16.964 --> 14:19.652
- Are you sure my dad won't notice?
- No, he'll never tell.

14:19.772 --> 14:22.468
He might as his whisky
now tastes of apple juice.

14:22.588 --> 14:23.938
It'll be worth it.

14:24.338 --> 14:25.907
- What's that?
- Fuck off!

14:26.027 --> 14:28.000
- What have you got there?
- And again, fuck off!

14:28.160 --> 14:31.160
- You are in such shit.
- That's a hat-trick. Fuck off!

14:31.321 --> 14:32.678
Mum knows you bunked off.

14:32.798 --> 14:35.319
And also everyone knows
that you love Carli D'Amato.

14:35.588 --> 14:38.279
- I don't love her, actually.
- Everyone knows, you spaz.

14:38.574 --> 14:41.119
You wrote it on the pavement
outside her house.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.559
Even the Year 11s were laughing
about how sad you are.

14:43.903 --> 14:46.653
Yeah? How sad is a date
at her house tonight?

14:47.121 --> 14:48.513
You're such a sad...

14:48.633 --> 14:50.833
No, you're the sad because... Twat!

14:50.953 --> 14:54.839
- You're such a little fuckshit.
- He's made you look a right nob.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.228
- When are you going to make the move?
- I don't know.

14:58.348 --> 15:01.920
- I've got to get the kid out the way.
- I could come and look after him.

15:02.080 --> 15:05.353
I'll take care of the kid
while you take care of the...

15:05.774 --> 15:06.774
business.

15:09.007 --> 15:10.088
Business.

15:14.087 --> 15:16.843
- I think I'd better take Will.
- Fine. Your funeral.

15:16.963 --> 15:19.439
<i>Jay was wrong.
It wouldn't be a funeral,</i>

15:19.601 --> 15:21.280
<i>but it would be as much fun as one.</i>

15:29.233 --> 15:30.518
<i>So that evening,</i>

15:30.638 --> 15:33.079
<i>we arrived at the house
of the girl Simon had always loved</i>

15:33.199 --> 15:35.953
<i>and we were drunk, so very drunk.</i>

15:36.073 --> 15:37.123
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:37.243 --> 15:39.700
- Hello, there.
- Hello, William.

15:40.326 --> 15:42.076
You coming in then, Simon?

15:43.187 --> 15:44.489
Are you his chaperone?

15:44.650 --> 15:47.145
No, babes.
He's gonna watch the kid while we chat

15:47.265 --> 15:49.129
about, you know, our feelings.

15:50.596 --> 15:53.250
- Best not to call me babes though.
- Really?

15:53.512 --> 15:54.330
Really.

15:55.601 --> 15:58.331
Come on in then.
Chris is watching TV, Will.

15:59.226 --> 16:01.498
Come on, you, let's get a drink.

16:02.889 --> 16:06.026
So Dad went totally ballistic
about the driveway.

16:06.324 --> 16:08.394
I think you're still invited over
for Christmas

16:08.514 --> 16:11.644
but he's gonna make your parents pay
for an industrial stone cleaner.

16:12.473 --> 16:15.210
- It was worth it.
- Can you smell bleach?

16:18.010 --> 16:19.723
- What are you watching?
- Don't know.

16:19.843 --> 16:22.011
- I think there's been a big bomb.
- Really?

16:22.131 --> 16:25.009
Oh, it's one of those recreations
of a dirty bomb.

16:25.171 --> 16:26.609
What's a dirty bomb?

16:26.877 --> 16:29.145
It's just a big nuclear bomb

16:29.265 --> 16:31.609
that terrorists would use to kill
everyone in London.

16:34.138 --> 16:36.169
Have you been drinking spirits?

16:37.137 --> 16:39.609
Sorry, don't know what I was thinking.
Would you like some?

16:39.866 --> 16:42.769
- I'll stick to wine, thanks.
- Wine is for girls.

16:42.889 --> 16:45.339
- I am a girl.
- This is a man's drink.

16:45.459 --> 16:47.021
If you don't want it, I'll have it.

16:47.141 --> 16:50.129
And if you can't take me like this,
well I'm sorry, babes,

16:50.291 --> 16:52.393
but this is the package.

16:57.227 --> 16:59.080
There goes the tallest building
in London.

16:59.200 --> 17:00.704
That'll be a few thousand dead.

17:00.824 --> 17:03.929
My mum and dad are in London tonight.
Would they be killed?

17:04.329 --> 17:06.930
Not only killed but obliterated.

17:07.390 --> 17:09.449
Merely a scorched shadow
on the pavement.

17:09.782 --> 17:10.519
Dust.

17:10.638 --> 17:13.770
- So they are dead forever?
- Yes, dead forever.

17:14.642 --> 17:16.296
My mummy!

17:16.415 --> 17:18.386
My daddy!

17:20.530 --> 17:21.768
Come on, Carli.

17:21.887 --> 17:23.564
You know why I'm here.

17:23.950 --> 17:25.661
And I know why I'm here.

17:27.637 --> 17:29.049
And you know why I'm here.

17:30.491 --> 17:32.729
- Kiss me.
- You know I've got a boyfriend.

17:32.891 --> 17:36.089
- Just finger yourself in front of me.
- Jesus, Simon!

17:36.251 --> 17:39.601
They do it in Caravan Club.
Come on, I know you want to.

17:39.721 --> 17:42.521
- Well I don't want to, so...
- Yeah, you do.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.031
Simon, are you all right?

17:52.549 --> 17:53.653
Oh, Christ.

18:02.006 --> 18:03.409
I don't think I'm very well.

18:03.961 --> 18:06.009
- Daddy! Mummy!
- Chris?

18:09.235 --> 18:12.080
I'm really sorry. I was just telling him
about terrorists and stuff.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.409
You were telling a seven-year-old
about terrorists?

18:14.577 --> 18:17.127
He won't sleep for a week now,
you idiot.

18:17.247 --> 18:19.409
Have you unblocked the sink yet?
All the lumps?

18:19.529 --> 18:20.809
I am really sorry.

18:20.970 --> 18:22.569
I think maybe I ate something.

18:23.530 --> 18:26.266
Could we maybe sit down
and talk about us?

18:26.386 --> 18:29.240
Have you got any Nurofen? It's just...

18:33.930 --> 18:34.975
Oh dear.

18:37.890 --> 18:39.609
I think we'll be off now.

18:40.564 --> 18:43.393
Right, I think we'd better get you
back to mine and cleaned up.

18:43.513 --> 18:45.308
Oh, God, my head.

18:46.517 --> 18:47.827
I've ruined it.

18:49.229 --> 18:52.278
I love her and I've ruined it with her.
Oh, God.

18:52.571 --> 18:54.250
She's so amazing.

18:54.410 --> 18:56.204
I'm going to say this
to you as a friend.

18:56.324 --> 18:57.844
Shut up.

18:58.087 --> 18:59.969
Today's been a fuck-up
from start to finish.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.646
We need to write it off, OK?
Today's gone.

19:02.766 --> 19:04.816
It isn't going to get any worse.

19:06.462 --> 19:08.811
Oh, shit. Isn't that your mum's car?

19:10.515 --> 19:12.365
And that's Neil's dad's car.

19:13.231 --> 19:14.325
Oh, shit.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.200
Oh, shit.

19:19.010 --> 19:21.766
Well, it's every Wednesday
and we play sort of, I suppose,

19:21.886 --> 19:25.255
best-of-three games.
The changing facilities are not too bad.

19:25.375 --> 19:28.151
- Yeah, yeah.
- All in all, it's a good thing.

19:31.704 --> 19:33.577
Right. Sit down, you two.

19:34.205 --> 19:36.329
<i>Sometimes in life you have to sit down,</i>

19:36.491 --> 19:38.541
<i>take your punishment like a man.</i>

19:39.211 --> 19:42.117
<i>Unfortunately,
this was not one of those times.</i>

19:43.890 --> 19:45.690
You've had quite a day off.

19:46.326 --> 19:48.956
You've lied to your mothers,
bought alcohol illegally,

19:49.076 --> 19:51.169
abused Neil's dad, stole my suit,

19:51.568 --> 19:54.249
defaced the pavement outside Carli's.
Am I missing anything?

19:54.879 --> 19:56.769
We also hit a spastic with a Frisbee.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.569
- I feel totally let down, William.
- It wasn't our fault, Mum.

20:00.730 --> 20:03.464
I said to Kevin here, I thought
I brought you up better than that.

20:03.584 --> 20:05.889
- It isn't our fault.
- Why's it not your fault then?

20:07.146 --> 20:09.077
It all happened because he touched us.

20:09.197 --> 20:10.592
- What?
- Me?

20:12.893 --> 20:14.609
He touched us here,

20:15.650 --> 20:16.490
and here.

20:18.263 --> 20:19.169
And here.

20:20.794 --> 20:24.050
- The bumhole.
- You evil little shits!

20:24.504 --> 20:26.030
I'll deal with this, Kevin.

20:26.150 --> 20:28.729
Now listen to me, you two.
That is an extraordinary allegation.

20:28.891 --> 20:30.929
You should think {very }carefully
before you repeat it.

20:31.091 --> 20:33.929
- Just cos Kevin's gay doesn't mean...
- No, I'm not gay.

20:34.091 --> 20:37.249
- We're all friends, it doesn't matter.
- I'm not gay. I was married for{ nearly}...

20:37.410 --> 20:40.075
- Oscar Wilde was married.
- That is enough!

20:40.195 --> 20:43.410
- Although, he is right, Kevin...
- I'm not gay!

20:43.530 --> 20:45.021
All right, don't have a hissy fit.

20:45.141 --> 20:48.145
Just because Kevin is gay doesn't
make him automatically a paedophile.

20:48.265 --> 20:49.769
I'm not a paedophile.

20:49.931 --> 20:51.649
If you want to repeat those allegations,

20:52.202 --> 20:53.729
we'll take them seriously.

20:53.893 --> 20:56.217
But if you want to tell us the truth,
that it never happened

20:56.337 --> 20:57.836
we'll move on to the other things

20:57.956 --> 20:59.466
- you're in trouble for.
- OK.

21:00.223 --> 21:03.250
The truth is... we're alcoholics.

21:03.719 --> 21:05.521
You have to help us.
All we can think about

21:05.641 --> 21:07.509
is where the next drink
is gonna come from.

21:07.629 --> 21:10.969
We're literally out of control.
Today we even talked about heroin.

21:11.532 --> 21:12.969
There's a long road ahead of us

21:13.130 --> 21:14.771
but with your support

21:14.891 --> 21:16.041
and your love

21:16.691 --> 21:17.929
we think we can make it.

21:18.258 --> 21:20.911
So please, as our parents,

21:22.689 --> 21:23.490
help us.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.018
<i>And so we were so pathetic,</i>

21:39.138 --> 21:42.911
<i>even my mum, who has no sense of humour,
was laughing at us.</i>

21:47.410 --> 21:50.529
- Hello. You look well.
- Thanks. How's your mum?

21:50.690 --> 21:51.610
Not happy.

21:51.770 --> 21:54.169
But fit like a prostitute.
How's your dad?

21:54.564 --> 21:57.649
Really not happy.
But at least he's not bent like Neil's.

21:57.810 --> 21:58.570
What?

21:59.273 --> 22:01.504
Shit, Si, you don't look well, mate.

22:01.624 --> 22:02.770
What happened?

22:02.890 --> 22:05.145
He was up all night
fucking Carli's brains out.

22:05.265 --> 22:06.076
Not quite.

22:06.196 --> 22:08.786
Obvioulsy, by "Not quite",
he means he puked on her brother's head

22:08.906 --> 22:10.851
then accused Neil's dad
of being a paedophile.

22:10.971 --> 22:12.180
You dickhead.

22:12.691 --> 22:13.741
What a knob!

22:14.687 --> 22:16.409
- My dad's not a paedo.
- Now, boys.

22:18.085 --> 22:19.729
Good of you to join us today.

22:19.890 --> 22:22.319
- Oh, shit.
- Shit indeed.

22:22.934 --> 22:25.089
Now, boys, you are in the sixth form.

22:25.601 --> 22:28.969
So actually you're under
no legal obligation to attend school.

22:29.265 --> 22:30.669
Sutherland, Cartwright,

22:30.789 --> 22:33.489
if you want to piss away your chance
of gaining some qualifications

22:33.651 --> 22:36.010
and improving your lives,
then be my guest.

22:36.130 --> 22:37.809
I still get paid at the end of the week.

22:38.066 --> 22:40.929
- Really? Oh, great.
- Brilliant. Thanks, sir.

22:41.144 --> 22:43.609
I knew no day
could go as badly as yesterday did.

22:43.771 --> 22:45.449
However, Cooper, MacKenzie,

22:46.232 --> 22:48.489
phoning the school and
pretending to be your parents?

22:49.611 --> 22:51.649
That, my little friends, is fraud.

22:52.828 --> 22:55.465
I think we'd better go and see the head.

23:07.259 --> 23:10.209
<i>They say it's the things you don't do
in life that you regret.</i>

23:10.329 --> 23:12.022
<i>Well that's clearly not true.</i>

23:12.142 --> 23:14.569
<i>I regret hitting that girl
with a Frisbee.</i>

23:15.080 --> 23:17.329
<i>And I regret hurling insults
at Neil's dad.</i>

23:17.490 --> 23:18.290
Bumder!

23:18.518 --> 23:22.010
<i>And I'm pretty certain Simon regrets
almost everything he did that day.</i>

23:24.010 --> 23:24.810
Oh, dear.

23:25.133 --> 23:27.529
<i>But they also say
all's well that ends well.</i>

23:28.761 --> 23:30.649
<i>Hang on, this didn't even end well.</i>

23:31.530 --> 23:33.861
