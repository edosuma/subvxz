01:10.470 --> 01:12.872
Why'd adam pick this dump
to meet this new mutant, huh?

01:12.907 --> 01:14.439
He didn't.

01:14.474 --> 01:18.078
We received an anonymous email
from that website that adam

01:18.113 --> 01:21.281
set up for new mutants
looking for protection.

01:21.316 --> 01:23.283
Bit paranoid, huh?

01:23.318 --> 01:24.849
Late too.

01:24.884 --> 01:26.886
We were supposed to
meet this guy like
fifteen minutes ago.

01:26.921 --> 01:28.488
Maybe he's
blowing us off.

01:29.289 --> 01:31.256
What?

01:31.291 --> 01:33.293
Just thought
i heard something.

01:35.295 --> 01:36.496
<cat meows>

01:38.898 --> 01:40.900
well,
unless that's the new mutant
we're supposed to meet,

01:40.935 --> 01:42.467
i'm out of here.

01:42.502 --> 01:44.104
I'm going to stay around
another five minutes.

01:44.139 --> 01:45.705
Well if you
want to stay...

02:46.566 --> 02:48.168
where'd they come from?

02:48.568 --> 02:50.570
I don't know, it must
have been a set-up.

04:04.043 --> 04:06.411
This is
really strange.

04:06.446 --> 04:09.249
The new mutant who sent us the
email suddenly doesn't exist.

04:09.284 --> 04:10.415
Hah.

04:10.450 --> 04:11.651
Told you it was a set-up.

04:12.051 --> 04:13.252
Yeah,
there's no doubt about it.

04:13.287 --> 04:14.454
But we weren't the only ones.

04:14.854 --> 04:16.055
Eckhart was duped as well.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.622
How do you know?

04:17.656 --> 04:19.259
Because proxy blue's been
reporting all morning about

04:19.293 --> 04:20.825
your fight last night.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.461
But there was no one else there.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.028
Apparently that's not the case.

04:24.063 --> 04:27.266
From what my insiders tell me,
the confrontation at hillside

04:27.301 --> 04:30.287
properties involves a certain
covert government agency and

04:30.322 --> 04:33.273
band of renegades, both of
whom have so far managed to

04:33.673 --> 04:36.075
maintain their
anonymity - until now.

04:36.476 --> 04:40.079
It seems the
clash was secretly recorded
in crystal digital quality.

04:40.480 --> 04:44.083
My informant promises to deliver
the dvd to the studio shortly.

04:44.118 --> 04:46.886
So soon, loyal viewers, you'll
finally be able to separate

04:46.921 --> 04:49.689
fact from fiction
with your very own eyes.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.656
Off.

04:51.691 --> 04:54.894
So last night was staged
just so we could lock horns.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.297
They must have had cameras
hidden all over the warehouse.

04:57.697 --> 04:58.863
Yeah.

04:58.898 --> 05:01.701
Well, if that's true, proxy
blue's about to expose mutant x.

05:01.736 --> 05:03.268
Not if we can stop her, right?

05:03.303 --> 05:06.506
Now,
any chance that you can trace
the identity of this emailer?

05:06.906 --> 05:08.908
Even if
i could trace the server,
there's no way of knowing

05:09.309 --> 05:10.910
whether or not he boomeranged
the message or even sent

05:10.945 --> 05:12.877
it from his own computer.

05:12.912 --> 05:15.315
Alright, so all we know for
sure right now is that it looks

05:15.350 --> 05:17.317
like we finally got something
in common with genomex:

05:17.717 --> 05:19.719
Both fighting the same enemy.

05:25.725 --> 05:28.928
Mr. Lanchester,
i don't like it when other
people know my business.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.532
Particularly when it comes
via the broadband spectrum

05:32.567 --> 05:34.934
of the likes of proxy blue.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.137
My men found six of these
cameras hidden in the warehouse.

05:38.538 --> 05:40.905
I see.

05:40.940 --> 05:44.944
Then we can assume
the disk indeed exists.

05:44.979 --> 05:47.347
The question is:
Who is behind this?

05:47.747 --> 05:49.714
Genomex is a large facility.

05:49.749 --> 05:52.952
Have you considered you may have
a leak in your organization?

05:52.987 --> 05:55.772
With the stringent internal
security i have in place,

05:55.807 --> 05:58.558
none of my people can so
much as think an unpure thought

05:58.593 --> 06:00.525
without me knowing about it.

06:00.560 --> 06:04.964
No, the tip-off had to
come from an outside party.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.966
We're trying to locate a
suspect by tracing the serial

06:07.367 --> 06:08.968
numbers off the cameras.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.336
You must move quickly.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.738
We can't let anyone
see what's on that disk.

06:13.773 --> 06:16.576
If the world caught a glimpse
of the reality of new mutants,

06:16.611 --> 06:20.179
we'd soon have a full-fledged
panic on our hands.

06:20.580 --> 06:23.583
After which,
i can all but guarantee
that every new mutant -

06:23.618 --> 06:26.586
including yourself - will
quickly become a public pariah.

06:26.986 --> 06:29.754
Not to mention
shut down genomex,

06:29.789 --> 06:32.592
and relegate
you to the status
of a traitor, i'm sure.

06:32.627 --> 06:38.563
I want this cancer
cut out before it spreads.

06:38.598 --> 06:41.000
You do understand i'll need
the latitude to use extreme

06:41.035 --> 06:43.803
measure to
restore anonymity.

06:43.838 --> 06:46.170
Certainly.

06:46.205 --> 06:49.208
As long as you understand
that anything shy of complete

06:49.243 --> 06:52.211
success will meet with
consequences just as deadly.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.819
You're probably as anxious as
i am to get a first-hand look

06:59.854 --> 07:01.786
at the face-off
at hillside properties.

07:01.821 --> 07:04.223
I promise, the moment
i see it - so will you.

07:04.258 --> 07:05.825
Off.

07:06.225 --> 07:07.427
Tell me you know who set us up.

07:07.462 --> 07:08.628
Not exactly.

07:09.028 --> 07:10.194
But we may be
closer to finding out.

07:10.229 --> 07:11.831
We've been tapping proxy blue's
hotline and the only unusual

07:12.231 --> 07:14.634
contact in the last couple
of days has come from inside a

07:15.034 --> 07:17.001
company called
macklin exporters.

07:17.036 --> 07:19.238
They're an international
retail shipping facility.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.441
Yeah, well let's hope we're
in time to stop them from

07:21.476 --> 07:23.443
shipping this
particular package.

07:38.257 --> 07:40.259
I want to know who ordered
the surveillance equipment,

07:40.294 --> 07:42.662
and i want to know now.

07:55.074 --> 07:57.477
Where did he
think he was going?

08:19.899 --> 08:22.301
Hold on.

08:29.909 --> 08:32.311
You work here?

08:32.346 --> 08:34.731
What's your name?

08:34.765 --> 08:37.081
I'm jay minhouse.

08:37.116 --> 08:39.519
Well, jay,
how's about you telling
me everything you know

08:39.919 --> 08:41.921
about what happened at the
hillside properties last night.

08:42.321 --> 08:45.525
I don't know what
you're talking about.

08:45.925 --> 08:47.892
You sure?

08:47.927 --> 08:51.531
Because your
co-workers didn't seem to
have any clue either and...

08:51.566 --> 08:53.750
i'm about out of patience.

08:53.785 --> 08:55.935
I swear, i don't know.

08:56.335 --> 08:57.902
Wrong answer.

08:57.937 --> 08:59.504
We checked
the office phone log.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.941
Somebody's been making personal
phone calls to proxy blue

09:01.976 --> 09:03.943
on the company dime.

09:03.978 --> 09:05.545
Last chance.

09:05.945 --> 09:07.547
Please, i'm telling
you the truth.

09:07.947 --> 09:14.353
Well,
looks like it's about time
you join your pals here.

09:14.388 --> 09:17.156
No. No, please.

09:30.770 --> 09:33.573
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own...

09:36.375 --> 09:38.377
my size?

10:30.029 --> 10:30.795
Come on.

10:30.830 --> 10:31.996
Who the hell
are you people?

10:32.031 --> 10:34.233
We'll get to that, but we
got to get you out of here.

10:34.268 --> 10:36.435
Well, unless you want to
stay and get better acquainted.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.850
I want him caught
- and contained.

10:55.254 --> 10:58.457
I'll finish cleaning up here.

11:26.719 --> 11:28.721
Well, at this point we don't
know a whole lot more than you.

11:29.121 --> 11:30.287
Yeah, right.

11:30.322 --> 11:33.090
Who are you people?

11:33.125 --> 11:34.727
Or, if you don't mind
my asking what are you?

11:35.127 --> 11:37.129
I saw you throw electricity
from your hands.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.897
We're new mutants.

11:39.932 --> 11:45.137
We have genetic
abilities, they...

11:45.172 --> 11:47.505
they make us...

11:47.540 --> 11:49.907
make us a little special.

11:49.942 --> 11:51.544
Well, that's putting it lightly.

11:51.944 --> 11:53.946
We have reason to
believe that somebody at
your company has video

11:53.981 --> 11:55.948
footage of us,
and they plan on turning
it over to the media.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.950
You got any
idea who that is?

11:58.350 --> 12:00.317
No, not at all.

12:00.352 --> 12:02.755
Jay, you're involved in this
somehow, you better tell us.

12:03.155 --> 12:04.757
You have to believe me.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.358
I'm not a spy.

12:06.759 --> 12:09.126
I swear.
I'm telling the truth.

12:09.161 --> 12:12.364
All i know is that the only
reason i'm alive is because

12:12.399 --> 12:14.767
i was late for work.

12:14.802 --> 12:16.769
Excuse me.

12:22.374 --> 12:24.777
Have a seat.

12:34.787 --> 12:36.388
Looks a
little freaked out.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.955
You know what,
i don't care.

12:37.990 --> 12:39.992
We don't have time
for grief counselling.

12:40.392 --> 12:42.359
Somebody in his company
is tipping off proxy blue.

12:42.394 --> 12:44.396
Now if he has the
information that can
lead us to the disc,

12:44.431 --> 12:45.998
he needs to tell us now.

12:50.803 --> 12:52.805
So far,
no word on what caused
that sudden explosion at

12:53.205 --> 12:55.207
macklin exporters,
which left five dead.

12:55.242 --> 12:57.209
Is this how you
contain the problem?

12:57.610 --> 13:01.213
It seems to
me you've only succeeded in
exacerbating our predicament.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.416
The situation called
for desperate measures.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.983
Oh, and by
"desperate measures"

13:06.018 --> 13:08.020
you mean blowing
macklin exporters sky-high?

13:08.055 --> 13:09.987
What's next,
public executions?

13:10.022 --> 13:11.824
I am telling you,
sir, at the moment,

13:11.859 --> 13:13.626
it was the only
prudent move to make.

13:14.026 --> 13:15.993
I stake my
reputation on it.

13:16.028 --> 13:18.831
There appears to be no
connection between last night's

13:18.866 --> 13:21.634
altercation at hillside
and the explosion at macklin.

13:21.669 --> 13:23.636
However, it is a
rather strange coincidence

13:23.671 --> 13:25.603
- don't you think?

13:25.638 --> 13:27.605
Let's hope you're
right, mr. Lanchester.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.241
At this point, what's
at stake is far more precious

13:29.276 --> 13:31.243
than your reputation.

13:32.444 --> 13:34.847
Damn, i wouldn't want to bump
into this guy in a dark alley.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.849
Lanchester is a new mutant
with the psionic ability

13:36.884 --> 13:38.851
to generate combustion.

13:39.251 --> 13:42.019
He can literally cook
you from the inside out.

13:42.054 --> 13:44.857
From the look of his rap
sheet, it doesn't take much

13:44.892 --> 13:47.224
to get him
to use it either.

13:47.259 --> 13:49.226
Well, because the guy's
a cold-blooded killing machine.

13:49.261 --> 13:52.464
And eckhart's
using him because he
can't afford to let the word

13:52.865 --> 13:55.267
get out about the
existence of new mutants
any more than we can.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.435
Yeah, i mean,
we want the same thing,
but we're not the ones

13:58.470 --> 14:02.074
hiring this microwave
warrior to keep the
rest of the world in line.

14:02.474 --> 14:03.676
True.

14:04.076 --> 14:06.078
Alright, so have you
been monitoring proxy blue?

14:06.113 --> 14:07.645
So far,
nothing new.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.082
But it's what she's
not reporting that's
got me a little nervous.

14:10.117 --> 14:11.649
What do you mean?

14:11.684 --> 14:13.686
Well,
proxy doesn't have
any new information,

14:14.086 --> 14:17.289
but it's as if she's
taunting her informants
to come forward.

14:17.324 --> 14:18.856
Alright, well,
if that's the case,

14:18.891 --> 14:21.293
then i'm betting that
she doesn't have the disc yet.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.295
How does macklin
exporters fit in?

14:23.330 --> 14:25.262
Huh.
We have no idea.

14:25.297 --> 14:26.899
Why don't you
dig into the database,

14:26.934 --> 14:28.465
see what you can find out?

14:28.500 --> 14:30.502
Jay,
i need you to concentrate.

14:30.903 --> 14:33.706
Can you think of anything
that might be helpful?

14:34.106 --> 14:36.874
Did you overhear
any conversations?

14:36.909 --> 14:41.714
How about when you left
for work this morning?

14:42.114 --> 14:44.882
There has to be something.

14:44.917 --> 14:46.919
Those people were my
friends, now they're dead.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.120
That's all i know.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.522
Jay,
would you just focus!

14:55.327 --> 14:56.929
Alright, brennan,
what have you got for me?

14:56.964 --> 14:58.130
Nothing, so far.

14:58.530 --> 14:59.931
Well, you think
he's holding back?

14:59.966 --> 15:01.333
I don't know, it's hard to say.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.335
Alright, well, i've got
jesse and emma digging under

15:03.370 --> 15:04.536
the skin of macklin exporters,

15:04.937 --> 15:06.939
but it's not easy considering
lanchester torched the place.

15:06.974 --> 15:08.906
Alright.

15:08.941 --> 15:10.943
I'll see if i
can find out anything.

15:20.152 --> 15:21.719
Alright, jay.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.756
This is what i need from you.

15:24.156 --> 15:26.358
A list of names of
all your former co-workers.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.560
I only started to work
there a couple weeks ago.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.162
You just told me
they were your friends.

15:30.562 --> 15:32.129
Yeah, they were my friends.

15:32.164 --> 15:35.367
So just cause i don't
remember their last names...

15:35.402 --> 15:37.787
i'm not lying.

15:37.822 --> 15:40.137
No, of course not.

15:40.172 --> 15:42.574
In order to lie,
you actually have to
tell us something.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.977
So far, you've
given us nothing.

15:45.377 --> 15:48.145
It's all my id.

15:48.180 --> 15:52.184
If you want it,
check out my apartment,

15:52.584 --> 15:54.551
you'll see I"m
telling the truth.

15:54.586 --> 15:57.389
And there's a list
of al the other employees
on my refrigerator.

16:00.192 --> 16:01.794
Alright.

16:02.194 --> 16:04.997
I'll be back.

16:16.208 --> 16:19.011
Am i going to die?

16:24.616 --> 16:26.984
No.

16:27.019 --> 16:30.222
You're going to be okay here.

16:34.226 --> 16:36.193
Place is clean.

16:36.228 --> 16:37.795
No sign of the disc anywhere.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.632
Maybe this minhouse character
was telling the truth after all.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.599
Either way,
he doesn't get a free ride.

16:42.634 --> 16:45.037
He's a witness, which means
he's a loose thread which

16:45.072 --> 16:47.004
desperately needs to be pulled.

16:47.039 --> 16:49.041
Ah, he's bound to screw up,
try to get in touch with a

16:49.441 --> 16:51.843
girlfriend, his mother, somebody
who means something to him.

16:51.878 --> 16:54.246
We found his address book, we're
searching for his next of kin.

16:54.281 --> 16:55.447
Good.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.014
It's time to send him a message.

16:57.049 --> 16:59.817
Yes, it will be the last
message he'll ever receive.

16:59.852 --> 17:03.055
Otherwise,
mr. Lanchester, it will
be your neck on the line.

17:18.270 --> 17:20.271
Managed to scrounge
up a few things.

17:20.672 --> 17:23.040
I don't know
if you're hungry.

17:23.075 --> 17:25.077
You really didn't have
to go to the trouble.

17:25.112 --> 17:28.244
Yeah, i did.

17:28.280 --> 17:34.286
I'm...
sorry i came down on
you like that before.

17:34.686 --> 17:38.290
That's okay.

17:38.690 --> 17:42.659
I kind of liked it.

17:42.694 --> 17:48.300
So this disc can really make
your lives miserable, huh?

17:48.335 --> 17:51.869
You have no idea.

17:51.904 --> 17:55.908
I mean,
it could completely
force us underground,

17:56.308 --> 17:58.310
and we're pretty much
cut off from the rest
of the world as it is.

17:58.710 --> 18:00.677
That's got to be rough,

18:00.712 --> 18:04.316
having to live a life
of seclusion like this.

18:04.351 --> 18:06.283
I don't know.

18:06.318 --> 18:08.320
I've been doing
it for so long,

18:08.720 --> 18:11.088
i guess i kind of
never thought about it.

18:11.123 --> 18:13.525
Well, why can't you just
come out on your own?

18:13.926 --> 18:15.928
Show the world
who you are, and just,

18:15.963 --> 18:17.930
you know,
kind of take it from there.

18:17.965 --> 18:19.897
You can't hide forever.

18:19.932 --> 18:23.135
Well,
i don't know if the rest
of the world is ready

18:23.535 --> 18:24.736
to accept us yet.

18:25.137 --> 18:26.703
Hm.

18:26.738 --> 18:29.141
Well,
i don't know about the
rest of the world, but...

18:29.176 --> 18:31.543
i bet i could.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.162
Where you
hiding minhouse?

18:50.197 --> 18:51.929
What difference
does it make?

18:51.964 --> 18:53.565
You checked
his place, he's clean.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.968
Hand him over now,
i might not hurt you.

18:56.003 --> 18:58.370
Okay,
let me think about that.

18:58.405 --> 18:59.972
Uh... no.

19:07.579 --> 19:10.782
You sure you
want to do that?

19:16.788 --> 19:20.392
Don't you think
we've had enough spectacle
in the public eye?

19:25.197 --> 19:28.000
Another time.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.802
I'll be waiting.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.402
Ready to come back to
the land of the living.

20:03.437 --> 20:05.369
Oh, god, sorry.

20:05.404 --> 20:07.406
You know, i've just been
replaying this whole day in

20:07.441 --> 20:09.373
my head over and over again.

20:09.408 --> 20:11.410
Wondering when you're
going to wake up and realize

20:11.445 --> 20:13.377
it was just a dream.

20:13.412 --> 20:15.379
Yeah,
something like that.

20:15.414 --> 20:18.016
Well, you're going
to get through it.

20:18.051 --> 20:20.619
We'll make sure
nothing happens to you.

20:21.019 --> 20:25.424
I just realized,
i never thanked you.

20:25.459 --> 20:28.227
It's just a sandwich.

20:28.627 --> 20:33.031
I meant for
saving my life.

20:33.066 --> 20:35.399
Oh.

20:35.434 --> 20:39.037
You really are
amazing, you know that?

20:39.438 --> 20:44.208
Now i'm talking
about the sandwich.

20:44.243 --> 20:51.049
Really, how am i ever
going to make it up to you.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.817
Well,
i'll tell you what.

20:53.852 --> 20:56.655
When this is all over,
you can buy me a drink,

20:56.690 --> 20:58.257
we'll call it even.

20:58.657 --> 21:01.059
A drink for a life, yeah,
that sounds pretty fair.

21:01.094 --> 21:03.462
Fine,
make it dinner.

21:03.862 --> 21:07.065
Well,
why don't we cut right
to the place where

21:07.100 --> 21:10.269
i get to walk you home.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.482
Okay, look,
i understand.

21:23.517 --> 21:25.449
I'm...

21:25.484 --> 21:29.087
no,
i... it's just...

21:29.488 --> 21:33.091
you know,
you've been through a lot
today, and i don't know,

21:33.126 --> 21:35.459
maybe it feels
like you haven't, but...

21:35.494 --> 21:39.097
i think maybe
what you're feeling for
me comes a little less

21:39.132 --> 21:41.900
out of the
moment than it does out
of the circumstance.

21:41.935 --> 21:43.066
Yeah.

21:43.101 --> 21:45.869
I took high
school psychology too.

21:45.904 --> 21:47.906
I guess i got a little bit
of a glorified hero complex

21:48.307 --> 21:49.908
working for me, is that it?

21:50.309 --> 21:52.711
Weli...
maybe a little.

21:52.746 --> 21:55.113
Maybe a lot.

21:57.115 --> 21:58.317
What have you got?

21:58.717 --> 21:59.883
Adam.

21:59.918 --> 22:03.121
Finally figured out what macklin
exporters is involved in.

22:03.522 --> 22:05.524
Exporting.

22:05.924 --> 22:09.092
They're completely legit.

22:09.127 --> 22:11.129
If they're a front
for a covert organization,

22:11.530 --> 22:13.131
then they spent the last ten
years covering their trail.

22:13.532 --> 22:14.698
Ah.

22:14.733 --> 22:16.335
Alright, well,
if that's the case
then we're dealing

22:16.370 --> 22:17.901
with a single operative.

22:17.936 --> 22:19.938
Someone within the
company working alone.

22:19.973 --> 22:21.940
What did you find
out about jay minhouse?

22:22.341 --> 22:24.308
Ah... nothing yet.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.144
Alright, pull up
their personnel records.

22:26.179 --> 22:27.946
I want background
checks on every employee.

22:27.981 --> 22:29.513
What about proxy blue?

22:29.548 --> 22:31.950
She's actually
been conspicuously
silent the last few hours.

22:31.985 --> 22:34.753
Maybe this is a story
that will just go away.

22:35.153 --> 22:36.720
Don't bet on it.

22:36.755 --> 22:38.722
No, i want you
to keep monitoring her.

22:38.757 --> 22:40.759
Eckhart isn't about to pull of
his human pitbull until he's

22:40.794 --> 22:43.161
got evidence that the
disc has been destroyed.

22:43.196 --> 22:44.380
Jesse?

22:44.415 --> 22:45.529
Mm?

22:45.564 --> 22:47.531
Call shalimar and brennan
and tell them to stay put.

22:47.566 --> 22:49.968
I don't want them
becoming target practice
for this lanchester.

22:50.003 --> 22:51.970
Wouldn't want that.

22:55.974 --> 22:58.342
Shalimar?

22:58.377 --> 22:59.978
Just a second.

23:00.013 --> 23:01.144
Sure.

23:01.179 --> 23:02.781
It'll give me a chance
to stack the deck.

23:03.181 --> 23:04.383
Yeah,
jesse, what you got?

23:04.783 --> 23:06.385
You guys getting
restless over there?

23:06.420 --> 23:07.986
Nah, we're doing alright.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.789
Ah, good, because adam wants
you and brennan to stay put

23:11.189 --> 23:13.191
until he's got the
situation under control.

23:13.226 --> 23:15.994
No problem.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.762
I'll let him know.

23:18.797 --> 23:20.799
So, adam doesn't want
us taking anymore day trips.

23:20.834 --> 23:26.422
Did you find anything
in my apartment?

23:26.457 --> 23:32.010
Weli... somebody got
there before i did.

23:32.411 --> 23:35.213
Lanchester?

23:35.248 --> 23:36.780
Bingo.

23:36.815 --> 23:38.417
My guess is he's not going
anywhere until he gets

23:38.817 --> 23:40.819
his hands on that disc.

23:40.854 --> 23:42.386
This is insane.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.022
I'm calling the police.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.390
No,
we can't do that.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.827
Well maybe
we can't, but i can.

23:48.862 --> 23:51.595
It's not that simple.

23:51.630 --> 23:54.833
You said it yourself, these
people will stop at nothing.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.437
Oh my god, rebecca.

23:58.837 --> 24:00.804
My sister.

24:00.839 --> 24:02.841
We'll protect her.

24:02.876 --> 24:04.260
Don't worry.

24:04.295 --> 24:05.609
Don't worry?

24:05.644 --> 24:07.646
Well, like an hour ago,
neither of you trusted me

24:07.681 --> 24:09.865
- now all of a sudden
i'm supposed to trust you?

24:09.900 --> 24:12.015
I don't think so,
i'm going to find her myself.

24:12.050 --> 24:15.654
So what are you going to do,
you're going to hold me hostage?

24:19.658 --> 24:21.660
Shalimar, i have to go.

24:25.263 --> 24:28.031
Jay.

24:28.066 --> 24:32.070
I'm going with you.

24:32.105 --> 24:34.037
What? No.

24:34.072 --> 24:35.874
Can't just let him walk
out, he'll be slaughtered.

24:35.909 --> 24:37.676
I mean,
you know what's going
to happen if lanchester

24:38.076 --> 24:39.242
gets his hands on him.

24:39.277 --> 24:40.879
And what if lanchester
gets a hold of you?

24:41.279 --> 24:42.881
I can take care of myself.

24:42.916 --> 24:44.483
Lanchester is a psycho.

24:44.883 --> 24:46.885
He kills people just for fun.

24:51.289 --> 24:53.692
You know, brennan, i would
appreciate it if you would just

24:53.727 --> 24:56.495
back me up on this one, please.

25:00.098 --> 25:02.901
Please.

25:15.313 --> 25:17.315
Be careful.

25:28.126 --> 25:30.494
Sadly, still no word
from my insider on the

25:30.529 --> 25:32.531
altercation at hillside, causing
me to wonder whether or not

25:32.931 --> 25:35.934
the whole thing was a hoax,
or if foul play is involved.

25:35.969 --> 25:38.937
You can safely assume our
situation is under control.

25:38.972 --> 25:40.539
The worst is over.

25:40.574 --> 25:41.705
Really?

25:41.740 --> 25:43.341
What if the disc
is still out there?

25:43.742 --> 25:46.109
What if proxy blue
gets a hold of it?

25:46.144 --> 25:48.947
I don't like to live in
a world full of what-ifs.

25:48.982 --> 25:50.949
I took out the entire
building, mr. Eckhart.

25:51.349 --> 25:53.351
Dead men tell no tales.

25:53.386 --> 25:55.318
But live ones do.

25:55.353 --> 25:57.756
We searched minhouse's apartment
up and down, he's clean.

25:57.791 --> 25:59.322
Yes.

25:59.357 --> 26:00.959
From what i gather,
breathing as well.

26:01.359 --> 26:03.361
I've got my men scouring
the city for any sign of him

26:03.762 --> 26:05.764
- or his relatives.

26:06.164 --> 26:08.532
I want every available
agent out there.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.369
Use our informants to sniff
out possible safehouses

26:11.404 --> 26:13.371
- anywhere mutant
x might frequent.

26:13.406 --> 26:15.338
We're already on it.

26:15.373 --> 26:18.577
I'm confident
both minhouse and mutant
x are within our reach.

26:18.612 --> 26:22.581
And my job isn't over until
each one of them is silenced.

26:31.790 --> 26:33.792
Give me the name again, i'll
see what i can come up with.

26:33.827 --> 26:35.759
Rebecca minhouse.

26:35.794 --> 26:38.196
We think that lanchester's
targeting jay's sister as a way

26:38.231 --> 26:39.763
to get him to
come out of hiding.

26:39.798 --> 26:42.200
Well, i can't find rebecca
minhouse anywhere in the area.

26:42.235 --> 26:44.202
Yeah, well, you probably
didn't look hard enough,

26:44.237 --> 26:45.403
so check again.

26:45.804 --> 26:47.405
I know how to work
the database, brennan.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.372
Trust me, she's not there.

26:49.407 --> 26:53.411
Maybe she's married, ask jay
if she goes by any other name.

26:57.015 --> 26:59.783
Brennan?

26:59.818 --> 27:01.419
Can't do that.

27:01.820 --> 27:03.021
Why not?

27:03.421 --> 27:05.824
Well,
because jay decided he wanted
to go look for her himself.

27:05.859 --> 27:07.826
Is he crazy,
he can't be out there alone.

27:08.226 --> 27:10.994
He's not.

27:11.029 --> 27:13.431
I just hope
we're not too late.

27:13.832 --> 27:15.834
I'm sure she's okay.

27:17.836 --> 27:20.238
If anything happened
to her, shalimar...

27:22.641 --> 27:24.643
hey, let me.

27:32.651 --> 27:35.053
Jay?

27:40.258 --> 27:42.661
Jay, let me out!

28:14.826 --> 28:16.428
What were you thinking, shal'?

28:16.828 --> 28:18.795
If lanchester
finds you, you're dead?

28:18.830 --> 28:20.832
What, did brennan just call
adam and tell him that i left?

28:20.867 --> 28:22.399
It's not even like that.

28:22.434 --> 28:24.401
He was just trying
to watch your back.

28:24.436 --> 28:26.438
Yeah, well i can watch my
own back, thank you very much.

28:26.473 --> 28:28.405
Yeah, obviously.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.442
Look, i don't know why jay
left, but i'm going to find out.

28:30.477 --> 28:32.461
No, shalimar,
it's not safe out there.

28:32.496 --> 28:34.446
Look, adam,
i had to do something,

28:34.481 --> 28:36.012
i couldn't just let him leave.

28:36.047 --> 28:38.049
Well, i understand,
but we're past that now.

28:38.084 --> 28:40.051
I mean, i can find him.
He can't have gone far.

28:40.452 --> 28:42.053
No, shalimar,
it's too dangerous,

28:42.088 --> 28:44.456
i want you to wait for emma.

28:44.491 --> 28:46.858
Alright?

28:47.258 --> 28:50.061
Shalimar, i want
you to stay where you are.

29:06.077 --> 29:08.880
<screams>

29:09.681 --> 29:12.484
that's your temporal vein
you feel heating up...

29:12.519 --> 29:14.451
argh. Stop it.

29:14.486 --> 29:17.288
It won't take me much more
of an effort to make it boil.

29:17.323 --> 29:20.492
Now, we're looking
for jay minhouse.

29:25.697 --> 29:27.664
Get in line.

29:27.699 --> 29:29.300
He's been seen with you.

29:29.701 --> 29:31.703
And your band of renegades.

29:32.103 --> 29:34.070
Do you see him with me now?

29:34.105 --> 29:36.508
I bet you know
where we can find him.

29:36.908 --> 29:39.711
What makes you
think i'd tell you.

29:39.746 --> 29:43.279
Argh.

29:43.314 --> 29:45.717
Just give me a reason
to turn up the heat.

29:45.752 --> 29:48.520
Now tell us where minhouse is.

29:54.926 --> 29:57.694
That's enough.

29:57.729 --> 30:00.532
[As eckhart]
Why trifle with the likes
of her when our real

30:00.567 --> 30:03.334
quarry is still out there,
running around free?

30:03.369 --> 30:05.702
Sir,
what are you doing here?

30:05.737 --> 30:08.540
[As eckhart]
Well, i was in the area
and just had to drop by.

30:08.575 --> 30:10.907
I decided to check up on you.

30:10.942 --> 30:13.745
I believe she can lead us
to minhouse, mr. Eckhart.

30:13.780 --> 30:15.712
[As eckhart] i see.

30:15.747 --> 30:18.950
In other words, you've
failed to locate him.

30:18.985 --> 30:23.319
I tire of your excuses.

30:23.354 --> 30:25.957
I told you, this minhouse
character is our top priority.

30:25.992 --> 30:28.560
Or do i have to have that
printed across my forehead

30:28.960 --> 30:32.964
for you to understand?

30:33.364 --> 30:35.166
I'll handle
miss fox from now on.

30:35.201 --> 30:36.933
I'm not sure that's
prudent, sir.

30:36.968 --> 30:38.970
[As eckhart]
That's why you work for me.

30:39.005 --> 30:40.537
Now complete your mission,

30:40.572 --> 30:42.574
and don't come back
until you've finished.

30:42.609 --> 30:45.376
Yes, sir.

30:55.787 --> 30:58.990
What are you two
idiots waiting for?

31:04.996 --> 31:06.597
Nice.

31:06.632 --> 31:08.416
Thanks.

31:08.451 --> 31:10.201
Thank you.

31:11.402 --> 31:12.969
Alright, give me
the good news, jesse.

31:13.004 --> 31:15.406
Well, i tapped into
macklin's personnel records,

31:15.441 --> 31:17.809
sifted through all their
employees' backgrounds.

31:17.844 --> 31:19.410
Yeah,
anything suspicious?

31:19.445 --> 31:20.977
Not much.

31:21.012 --> 31:22.979
Except for one thing.

31:23.014 --> 31:26.217
Why would
a guy with a degree in
journalism take a job

31:26.252 --> 31:28.219
packing computer chips?

31:28.254 --> 31:29.385
I don't know.

31:29.420 --> 31:31.422
Maybe he's looking
to change careers.

31:31.823 --> 31:33.790
Right, or maybe trying
to turn one around.

31:33.825 --> 31:35.827
See,
jay was fired from his
first media job after

31:35.862 --> 31:37.794
accusations
of plagiarism.

31:37.829 --> 31:39.831
He's never really managed
to get another job in his

31:39.866 --> 31:41.032
own field since then.

31:41.432 --> 31:43.034
He's just kind of
bounced from job to job.

31:43.069 --> 31:44.636
Hm.

31:45.036 --> 31:47.438
So you think he's the one
who tipped off proxy blue?

31:47.473 --> 31:50.659
Well, a story like this
could make a career.

31:50.694 --> 31:53.845
Any way to find out
if he's got a sister?

31:53.880 --> 31:55.446
I already checked.

31:55.847 --> 31:58.650
Shalimar
put her life on the
line for the very guy who

31:59.050 --> 32:01.452
set us up in the first place.

32:09.060 --> 32:11.062
The official word on that
mysterious blast that left five

32:11.462 --> 32:14.265
dead at macklin exporters:
It seems it was an accident.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.232
How disappointing.

32:16.267 --> 32:21.072
Mr. Lanchester, nice work
deflecting the blame away from

32:21.107 --> 32:24.676
the gsa in that
unfortunate accident.

32:24.711 --> 32:26.678
Uh... thank you, sir.

32:27.078 --> 32:28.279
What's wrong?

32:28.680 --> 32:30.682
Didn't we just
speak a minute ago?

32:30.717 --> 32:32.649
Sorry,
am i bothering you?

32:32.684 --> 32:35.486
I didn't realize there was
a limit to our interaction.

32:35.521 --> 32:37.854
I apologize, sir,
please continue.

32:37.889 --> 32:40.291
Intelligence has just informed
me minhouse has activated

32:40.326 --> 32:41.858
his cell phone.

32:41.893 --> 32:43.494
They're tracing
the signal as we speak.

32:43.895 --> 32:45.061
Excellent.

32:45.096 --> 32:47.498
It's about time
i finished the job.

32:55.907 --> 32:57.909
We're coming in, adam.

32:57.944 --> 32:59.876
Couldn't find jay.

32:59.911 --> 33:02.714
I just hope he got to his
sister before lanchester did.

33:03.114 --> 33:05.116
Shalimar,
he doesn't have a sister.

33:05.151 --> 33:08.284
What?

33:08.319 --> 33:10.687
He's the guy who set
us up in the first place,

33:10.722 --> 33:13.124
and i'm guessing he's got the
video disc hidden someplace,

33:13.159 --> 33:15.126
waiting to deliver
it to proxy blue...

33:15.526 --> 33:17.528
adam, i've got a signal
off of jay's cell phone.

33:17.563 --> 33:19.095
Where is he?

33:19.130 --> 33:21.132
I don't know, i'm trying
to narrow it down now.

33:21.167 --> 33:23.134
Give us the coordinates,
we'll head over.

33:23.169 --> 33:24.701
No, no. Stay where you are.

33:24.736 --> 33:26.738
We don't know anything about
this guy, he could be dangerous.

33:26.773 --> 33:28.957
Well, you know what, we don't
have a lot of choice here.

33:28.992 --> 33:31.142
All he needs is a laptop and a
modem to send the contents of

33:31.177 --> 33:33.161
the disc to the world.

33:33.196 --> 33:35.146
She's right, adam.

34:13.184 --> 34:15.551
Tell proxy to get ready
to go live with the feed.

34:15.585 --> 34:18.790
I'm about to give her proof
of the new mutants' existence.

34:19.190 --> 34:22.393
And make sure that i get the
credit for blowing this story

34:22.428 --> 34:25.196
wide open, alright.

34:35.606 --> 34:37.608
Here's a news
flash for you, jerk:

34:38.009 --> 34:40.411
This is one
story i'm about to kill.

34:40.446 --> 34:42.813
Shalimar,
please, i can explain.

34:50.822 --> 34:55.226
Sorry, babe, i'm not about
to let you ruin my career.

35:00.431 --> 35:03.434
I mean it, shalimar, i'm not
the pushover you thought i was.

35:03.469 --> 35:06.437
Turns out you're not a lot
of things i thought you were.

35:06.838 --> 35:08.840
Yeah, well, you got to admit
i did a pretty good job playing

35:08.875 --> 35:11.207
the damsel in distress,
wouldn't you say?

35:11.242 --> 35:13.644
Well, i'm going to show you
a few things about distress.

35:13.679 --> 35:15.646
I wouldn't test
me if i were you.

35:15.681 --> 35:18.815
Hand it over.

35:18.850 --> 35:20.852
Well, i guess he doesn't
leave us any choice.

35:20.887 --> 35:22.854
Does he, emma?

35:25.656 --> 35:27.658
Argh.

35:30.061 --> 35:32.063
You freaks ought
to be destroyed.

35:32.098 --> 35:33.664
After you.

35:42.073 --> 35:44.075
Let's go.

36:42.133 --> 36:45.336
You should have just let me
have him when i had the chance.

37:16.167 --> 37:18.134
You okay?

37:18.169 --> 37:20.171
Yeah, thanks to you.

37:30.181 --> 37:32.183
Want to get
the hell out of here?

37:34.585 --> 37:36.587
Hey, you okay?

37:36.988 --> 37:38.990
Adam?

37:39.390 --> 37:42.158
Not so fast, mr. Kilmartin.

37:42.193 --> 37:45.761
You haven't even
heard what i have to say.

37:45.796 --> 37:52.168
Well it appears
mr. Minhouse has missed
his deadline - for good.

37:52.203 --> 37:56.207
You have any idea
how close he came to exposing
us all to proxy blue?

37:56.242 --> 37:58.174
Yes.

37:58.209 --> 38:02.613
How ironic that you
and i should find ourselves
battling a mutual foe.

38:02.648 --> 38:05.816
Although, i have to admit,
things could have gone a lot

38:05.851 --> 38:08.619
smoother if only we had
agreed to work together.

38:08.654 --> 38:11.787
Yes, weli...

38:11.822 --> 38:16.627
seems we can all breathe
a little easier now.

38:16.662 --> 38:19.430
The only question
left, of course, is...

38:19.830 --> 38:23.034
where does that leave us?

38:23.069 --> 38:25.453
That's up to you.

38:25.488 --> 38:27.838
I want that disc.

38:40.651 --> 38:43.454
Come and get it.

39:10.281 --> 39:13.084
We're done here.

39:36.307 --> 39:39.075
Torch the place?

39:39.110 --> 39:45.116
And proxy blue gets an anonymous
tip about a serial arsonist?

40:00.731 --> 40:02.733
Let's get the hell out of here.

40:03.134 --> 40:05.136
Yeah, wait a
minute, not so fast.

40:05.171 --> 40:06.955
Who wants to do the honours?

40:06.990 --> 40:08.739
I'll take a crack at it.

40:08.774 --> 40:10.741
Knock yourself out.

40:16.347 --> 40:19.150
He shoots, he scores.

40:42.306 --> 40:44.708
So, tell me something,
wiseguy, as a former conman,

40:45.109 --> 40:47.111
how is it that jay managed to...

40:47.146 --> 40:48.712
con you?

40:49.113 --> 40:50.714
What,
it takes one to no one?

40:50.749 --> 40:51.881
Uh, yeah.

40:51.916 --> 40:53.517
You know it doesn't
work like that.

40:53.918 --> 40:55.519
I don't know,
i didn't get a feeling
for him either way.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.887
Well, actually, no,

40:57.922 --> 40:59.523
until i saw the way that
shalimar acted around him.

40:59.924 --> 41:01.525
How is that?

41:01.560 --> 41:03.893
Weli...

41:03.928 --> 41:05.529
i don't know,

41:05.930 --> 41:07.932
i just didn't
like the way she stuck
her neck out for him.

41:07.967 --> 41:12.736
Why, because you
were feeling protective?

41:12.771 --> 41:17.506
Oh, or jealous?

41:17.541 --> 41:20.344
Protective, smartass.

41:20.379 --> 41:21.946
Sure.

41:22.346 --> 41:23.913
I'm okay.

41:23.948 --> 41:27.151
But you still seem
pretty pissed about jay.

41:27.186 --> 41:29.971
Well,
you know what it is,
i just feel stupid.

41:30.006 --> 41:32.756
I mean, when we found
him he was just like...

41:32.791 --> 41:35.124
like a dog who'd
been kicked too hard.

41:35.159 --> 41:37.961
My nurturing insctincts
took over and i just...

41:37.996 --> 41:40.729
i just can't believe
i misjudged someone like that.

41:40.764 --> 41:43.567
Yeah, well,
it's not like i'm hitting
the bonus board when

41:43.602 --> 41:45.534
it comes
to judging guys.

41:45.569 --> 41:47.571
When was the last
time i had a date.

41:47.972 --> 41:49.939
I know, sweetie,
but honestly, i mean,

41:49.974 --> 41:53.577
if i wore this i wouldn't
be getting any action either.

42:03.587 --> 42:05.990
Well, it's a start.
