WEBVTT

00:00.674 --> 00:01.504
Give us a shout
when you're in.

00:01.575 --> 00:02.803
Okay... okay!

00:07.748 --> 00:08.908
Not worth getting
out of bed for.

00:08.982 --> 00:11.712
Go away! A tenner for two hours
work's not bad, is it?

00:11.785 --> 00:13.753
We'll be back home before
the kids go to school.

00:13.821 --> 00:15.288
Why can't we get involved
in laying it?

00:15.355 --> 00:16.822
We'd make a few more bob
out of that.

00:17.591 --> 00:19.684
He's got another gang there
doing it, that's why.

00:19.760 --> 00:21.250
He's got a couple of gangs working
for him then, has he?

00:21.328 --> 00:22.022
Got loads fellas working
for him.

00:22.096 --> 00:24.121
He has one gang cutting it,
one gang laying it.

00:24.198 --> 00:25.825
But he's got gangs all over
the bloody country.

00:25.899 --> 00:27.696
Does loads of work, you know,
Dixie.

00:27.768 --> 00:30.236
You'd think he'd have a decent
van... Jesus Christ!

00:30.304 --> 00:34.638
What does he want a decent
van for, for bloody old soil and
wheelbarrows and spades!

00:34.708 --> 00:40.044
That's pushed my piles back
about a fortnight.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

01:13.013 --> 01:14.844
All right, let's get these shovels
moving here.

01:14.915 --> 01:15.711
Eh, where are we?

01:15.782 --> 01:16.578
The Con Club.

01:16.650 --> 01:18.140
Conservative Club?
/Yeah.

01:18.218 --> 01:20.049
We're not nicking their fucking
turf, are we?

01:20.120 --> 01:21.417
You're not a Tory, are you?
/No.

01:21.488 --> 01:23.285
Well what are you worried
about then?

01:23.357 --> 01:25.518
Yeah, the caretaker lives miles
away, there's no problem...

01:25.592 --> 01:27.856
all you've got to do...
is heads down... arses up...

01:27.928 --> 01:30.192
let's get into gear and make
a couple of bob, come on...

01:34.735 --> 01:35.861
Here you are,
Kevin Keegan.

01:35.936 --> 01:37.301
You get over here and take
this corner...

01:38.372 --> 01:39.100
Hurry up...

01:39.173 --> 01:40.231
What am I going to do?

01:40.307 --> 01:43.936
Roll them over and take them
back to the wagon...

01:44.011 --> 01:44.978
Come here...

01:45.045 --> 01:48.503
Keep in a straight line, make them
about a foot long...

01:48.582 --> 01:49.981
so you can roll them
up like a carpet...

01:50.050 --> 01:51.984
Here you are, dopey arse,
you get over here.

01:52.052 --> 01:54.179
Now go in sections
as fast as you can...

01:54.254 --> 01:56.188
a couple of barows and
we're up the road, all right!

02:04.331 --> 02:06.265
Now come, Dean, hurry up,
lad, will you!

02:13.440 --> 02:18.377
Too early for this sort of stuff
for me. I've got a bad back.

02:19.146 --> 02:22.707
Hey you, can't you keep up with
me here or what?

02:27.287 --> 02:28.777
Oh, keep them neat,
will you, lad...

02:28.855 --> 02:31.255
come on, Tommy
just make it safe there...

02:57.317 --> 02:57.942
Oi!

03:04.491 --> 03:06.391
Oh no!

03:06.460 --> 03:08.223
Communist bastards!

03:09.463 --> 03:11.488
We can pick up a roller from
a scrap-yard dirt cheap.

03:11.565 --> 03:14.056
All you want then is a roll
of twine, a couple of pegs...

03:14.134 --> 03:16.659
couple of banjoes, a plank,
a wheelbarrow and a rake.

03:16.737 --> 03:18.136
We're on our way.

03:18.205 --> 03:19.672
Yeah, to do the businesses
properly.

03:19.740 --> 03:21.605
Now, it all depends if I get
my hands on a van.

03:21.675 --> 03:23.336
Just put an advert
in the local paper.

03:23.410 --> 03:24.536
And I'll need me phone
putting in.

03:24.611 --> 03:26.408
Correct. As soon as a local
punter rings up...

03:26.480 --> 03:27.845
I go down,
measure the job...

03:27.914 --> 03:30.576
go nick the turf, lay it down,
get paid all in the same day.

03:30.651 --> 03:31.709
You ever done it before?

03:31.785 --> 03:34.481
Dead easy, lad, like laying carpet
tiles, isn't it?

03:34.554 --> 03:35.953
Just make sure the underneath's
dead flat.

03:36.023 --> 03:36.853
Where do we get
the turf from?

03:36.923 --> 03:38.220
Parks, gardens, cemeteries...

03:38.292 --> 03:39.850
And Conservative Clubs!

03:39.960 --> 03:41.484
Well that's the best
quality stuff.

03:41.561 --> 03:43.324
We get a few extra bob
for that, don't we?

03:43.397 --> 03:44.659
But I've got to get
a van.

03:44.731 --> 03:46.562
Where we going to
get a van from?

03:55.375 --> 03:59.402
To ensure tenancy arrangement
under the private landlords...

03:59.479 --> 04:01.470
So, where does the difference
come in?

04:01.548 --> 04:03.573
The difference is you've got
no you've got no protection...

04:17.397 --> 04:19.058
If you get any problems at all,
give us a shout.

04:19.132 --> 04:20.463
Yeah, okay.

04:20.534 --> 04:21.728
Hello, Bob.
/Hello, Jimmy.

04:21.802 --> 04:22.734
This is my son-in-law,
Bob.

04:22.803 --> 04:23.792
Pleased to meet you...

04:23.870 --> 04:25.895
This is Ken Rider, councillor.

04:25.972 --> 04:27.371
Second prize again, eh?

04:27.441 --> 04:29.136
I hope you got it
fighting for the working class.

04:29.209 --> 04:30.267
I've got to go now.

04:30.344 --> 04:31.368
Give us a ring.
/Nice one.

04:31.445 --> 04:32.309
No problem.

04:34.114 --> 04:34.773
All right, son.

04:34.848 --> 04:36.145
Listen...

04:36.216 --> 04:37.979
I'm after a van. You don't
know anyone, do you?

04:38.051 --> 04:39.211
A van?

04:39.286 --> 04:40.753
Yeah, nothing fancy.

04:40.821 --> 04:41.719
Have you got the money?

04:41.788 --> 04:42.720
Depends on the price.

04:42.789 --> 04:44.279
But without a van
I can't work.

04:44.358 --> 04:47.384
Er... hang on, I'm sure there's
a card come in yesterday.

04:47.461 --> 04:48.291
Cheers, Jimmy.

04:50.897 --> 04:52.091
Yeah... this is it.

04:52.165 --> 04:53.427
This is it.

04:55.969 --> 04:57.766
Only come in yesterday
this, Bob.

04:58.872 --> 05:01.363
Let's look at that.
Two-sixty!

05:01.441 --> 05:03.068
Well he won't rip you off,
you know...

05:03.143 --> 05:04.508
you know Cliff, don't you?

05:04.578 --> 05:07.604
Cliff... oh, is that the little guy
always wears a boiler suit full of grease?

05:07.681 --> 05:08.773
Lives on Hollins.

05:08.849 --> 05:10.476
I'll give that a look at,
cheers.

05:11.485 --> 05:13.146
You're looking a mess,
you know, son.

05:13.220 --> 05:14.778
I feel a mess.

05:14.855 --> 05:16.982
Listen, what did this Communion
dress cost you?

05:17.057 --> 05:18.285
Oh, has our Anne been talking?

05:18.358 --> 05:19.848
Anne hasn't mentioned
it, son.

05:19.926 --> 05:22.019
Young Coleen's been coming around
telling me all about it...

05:22.095 --> 05:23.153
and I put two and
two together...

05:23.230 --> 05:25.255
you know, it must have cost
you a bomb.

05:26.266 --> 05:27.893
Yeah, a good few
quid, yeah.

05:27.968 --> 05:29.162
But I'll manage.

05:29.236 --> 05:31.796
Aye, so I see. Look.
/No, you look!

05:31.872 --> 05:33.635
I've got a lot of respect
for you, Jimmy...

05:33.707 --> 05:35.140
but this is none
of your business.

05:35.208 --> 05:36.505
Bobby... we're family.

05:36.576 --> 05:38.942
Look, I got meself in this mess,
I'll get meself out.

05:39.012 --> 05:40.570
Not through the Church
you won't, son.

05:40.647 --> 05:42.012
What's the Church
got to do with it?

05:42.082 --> 05:43.743
Because you're looking for
answers and there isn't any...

05:43.817 --> 05:45.648
because they're part
of the problem.

05:45.719 --> 05:48.483
Look, you've got
your beliefs...

05:48.555 --> 05:50.648
I've got mine.
Okay?

05:50.724 --> 05:52.919
No, what you've got
is fear.

05:52.993 --> 05:55.791
And five Hail Marys ain't
going to help what ails you.

05:55.862 --> 05:57.591
Because all this religious
mumbo-jumbo...

05:57.664 --> 06:00.758
all it does is tire your mind
and stop you thinking for yourself.

06:00.834 --> 06:03.803
Look, Jimmy, the last thing I need
right now is a lecture.

06:03.870 --> 06:05.201
Or a sermon.

06:05.272 --> 06:07.137
No what you need is a job
and there aren't any.

06:07.207 --> 06:09.175
Oh, now tell us something
I don't know.

06:09.242 --> 06:13.303
When you're a worker, it
'rains stones' seven days a week.

06:13.380 --> 06:15.280
And then it pisses
down on me.

06:15.348 --> 06:16.679
Ah, not only on
you, Bob...

06:16.750 --> 06:19.116
you see, you're walking around
with this individual guilt...

06:19.186 --> 06:21.586
and this is what they want.
It's destroying you.

06:21.655 --> 06:24.055
God knows, you know, given
half the chance I know
you're a grafter.

06:24.124 --> 06:25.751
It's not done us much good,
though, has it?

06:25.826 --> 06:27.555
We never invented
the system, son...

06:27.627 --> 06:29.219
but it's up to us to change it.

06:29.296 --> 06:31.161
What's that?
/Slanging match.

06:38.405 --> 06:39.497
Smack-heads!

06:39.573 --> 06:41.507
But she can't be any more
than fifteen.

06:42.909 --> 06:43.603
You've got my ring!

06:43.677 --> 06:45.042
I haven't, Ellen! I haven't
got your ring!

06:45.111 --> 06:46.373
Well you've got me money then,
haven't you?

06:46.446 --> 06:47.378
No! Cos I want to score
tonight as well.

06:47.447 --> 06:49.210
You're a liar!
You're a liar!

06:49.282 --> 06:52.217
I need to score tonight.
You know for a fact...

06:52.285 --> 06:53.752
What chance have they got?

06:53.820 --> 06:55.845
You know, one or two might
slip through the net...

06:55.922 --> 06:57.947
but for the rest of them,
it's, you know, it's mapped out...

06:58.024 --> 06:59.491
it's all cut and dried.

06:59.559 --> 07:00.457
They've got no work...

07:00.527 --> 07:01.585
no hope...

07:01.661 --> 07:02.491
it's all despair.

07:02.562 --> 07:06.191
All the they've got is crime,
booze, drugs...

07:06.266 --> 07:08.166
families just breaking up.

07:08.235 --> 07:10.760
And do you know, it could be
a lovely estate to live on.

07:10.837 --> 07:13.670
Do you know, we're like punch
drunk fighters hammering
at each other...

07:13.740 --> 07:18.507
instead of us getting together and
sharing around the power for us
to make all the changes...

07:18.578 --> 07:21.604
and that's all it is in a nutshell,
the rest is propaganda.

07:25.719 --> 07:26.845
It'll do about thirty to the gallon
on the road.

07:26.920 --> 07:27.648
Let's have a look round here...

07:27.721 --> 07:29.086
Hang on, hang on a minute,
Tommy...

07:29.155 --> 07:30.952
Well, you have a look.
I'll have a look here.

07:31.024 --> 07:31.718
Yeah, but Tommy...

07:31.791 --> 07:34.692
Oh, come on Cliff, play the game,
look at the bloody bodywork, son.

07:34.761 --> 07:35.420
What's wrong with
that?

07:35.495 --> 07:38.362
Jesus Christ, there's more
filler here than on Barbara
Cartland's face!

07:38.431 --> 07:40.331
There's some spots of fillers...

07:40.400 --> 07:42.061
Look at that, the tyres are
bleedin' baldy.

07:42.135 --> 07:43.193
They're remoulds.

07:43.270 --> 07:43.827
Yeah?

07:43.904 --> 07:46.270
Yeah, well, you don't see
the tread with remoulds, do you.

07:46.339 --> 07:47.271
You're joking,
aren't you!

07:47.340 --> 07:49.171
I've seen more rubber on a
bleedin' French letter!

07:49.242 --> 07:50.732
You must have a big
French letter.

07:50.810 --> 07:52.243
You've got new tyres
on the front!

07:52.312 --> 07:54.371
Hey, Cliff... I'm having it.

07:54.447 --> 07:56.210
Right, how are you
having it, then?

07:56.283 --> 07:58.114
Is there any chance of us, er...
knocking the price down?

07:58.184 --> 07:59.344
Oh, here we go now,
knock it down!

07:59.419 --> 08:00.545
How many owners has
it had?

08:00.620 --> 08:01.882
Owners! Only one owner!

08:01.955 --> 08:03.479
Who was it, fucking Ben Hur?
/Who's Ben hur?

08:03.557 --> 08:04.285
Come on, Cliff!

08:04.357 --> 08:05.289
Does he live on the Estate?

08:05.358 --> 08:08.953
Cliff, Cliff...
I'm buying the thing, right?

08:09.029 --> 08:10.792
Can we knock it down to
two hundred?

08:12.699 --> 08:14.997
How can you do that,
I've got to make some money...

08:15.068 --> 08:18.936
He's lost his mother! I'm going to
lose my wife if I sell it for any
less than that.

08:19.005 --> 08:19.835
Two hundred?

08:19.906 --> 08:22.568
No, two sixty, and
that's it.

08:22.642 --> 08:24.234
Cliff, I haven't got that
amount of money on me.

08:24.311 --> 08:26.506
What about if we can come
to some sort of deal?

08:27.647 --> 08:30.207
Can I pay you weekly...

08:30.283 --> 08:33.878
So you're paying half the price of
the two sixty, right?

08:33.953 --> 08:36.923
And a tenner a week.

08:36.990 --> 08:39.549
Can you manage that? I don't
want any pissing about.

08:39.626 --> 08:41.594
If you say a tenner
a week, I want it.

09:07.487 --> 09:09.887
Mum! Dad's got
a new van!

09:11.157 --> 09:12.715
I'm going downstairs
and see him.

09:28.041 --> 09:29.804
Hey, dad!
/Coleen...

09:31.211 --> 09:32.508
Yeah, look at this!

09:32.579 --> 09:34.376
What! Is is this ours!
/Like it?

09:34.447 --> 09:36.074
Yeah, it's great,
isn't it?

09:36.149 --> 09:37.514
Come on, let me show you
the inside.

09:39.152 --> 09:41.347
What do you think?

09:42.355 --> 09:45.324
That's ours?
/Yeah, it's not bad, is it?

09:45.392 --> 09:47.292
Why didn't you tell me
you were getting a van?

09:47.360 --> 09:49.988
It came out of the blue. A bargain,
two sixty. Snatched his hand off.

09:50.063 --> 09:51.758
Two sixty?

09:51.831 --> 09:53.799
Look, the bloke I'm getting
it off is a mate of mine.

09:53.867 --> 09:57.462
And he says I can pay him back
bit-by-bit once I start earning
the money.

09:57.537 --> 10:00.165
Ah, come on, this is us, kid,
we're on our way up now.

10:00.740 --> 10:01.832
I can start earning
wages with this.

10:01.908 --> 10:04.274
In fact, I've already pulled one
little job on the way down.

10:04.344 --> 10:06.244
Yeah?
/Moving a little bit of furniture...

10:06.312 --> 10:07.609
so it's a start.

10:07.681 --> 10:09.273
Oh, it's got to be
right, this.

10:09.349 --> 10:11.044
It's going to make it for us.
So what do you reckon?

10:12.352 --> 10:14.320
Well, it could do with a bit
of a clean, couldn't it?

10:14.387 --> 10:15.979
Bit of elbow grease and
it'll be fine, this.

10:16.056 --> 10:18.684
Dad, when can we have
a ride in it?

10:18.758 --> 10:20.191
Later love, later.
But for now...

10:20.260 --> 10:22.854
you can sit in the driver's seat and
play with the steering wheel.

10:22.962 --> 10:25.487
There you go. Get in there.
Have a go on the steering wheel.

10:26.132 --> 10:28.464
Hey, can earn some money
with this, love.

10:28.535 --> 10:30.025
Brilliant!

10:38.878 --> 10:39.537
Ta-ta, love...

10:42.982 --> 10:43.744
Hello, Gilbert.

10:43.817 --> 10:44.977
Hello, Bob.
Are you all right?

10:45.051 --> 10:46.541
Yeah, fine.
Better now.

10:46.619 --> 10:48.644
I know what you mean,
mate, yeah.

10:48.722 --> 10:50.713
Yeah, see you later
then, Bob.

10:58.364 --> 11:00.093
You little shithead!
/I was going to pay you!

11:00.166 --> 11:01.326
Oh, yeah! Were you?

11:01.401 --> 11:03.266
I've got the money! I was going
to pay you!

11:05.705 --> 11:06.899
I've got the money!

11:06.973 --> 11:07.735
I want it now!

11:07.807 --> 11:08.933
I've got it!

11:13.780 --> 11:15.042
You never give me
a chance.

11:15.115 --> 11:16.946
When you borrow money,
you pay it back.

11:17.016 --> 11:18.415
Right.
/Right!

11:18.485 --> 11:20.817
And never mind spending it
at bookies.

11:20.887 --> 11:22.013
Look, we want this
every week...

11:22.088 --> 11:23.385
Right...
/Every week.

11:23.456 --> 11:24.548
You owe a lot of money!
/Right! Right!

11:24.624 --> 11:25.989
Don't spend it
in the bookies...

11:26.059 --> 11:27.026
I'm warning you!
/I won't!

11:27.093 --> 11:28.253
A warning!
/Okay...

11:30.396 --> 11:32.626
Oh, yes...
part time cleaners...

11:32.699 --> 11:34.223
evening shifts
for city centre.

11:34.300 --> 11:37.167
Mmm... that looks all right,
doesn't it, where is it?

11:37.237 --> 11:38.397
Oh, Stretford.

11:38.471 --> 11:40.268
Waste of time,
isn't it, that?

11:40.340 --> 11:42.672
Travel'd be a week's wages,
wouldn't it?

11:42.742 --> 11:44.369
See if there's anything else.

11:45.311 --> 11:46.539
"Returning to work..."

11:46.613 --> 11:47.409
Mum?

11:47.480 --> 11:47.946
Yeah?

11:48.014 --> 11:49.538
Can I have some money to go
to the chippy, please?

11:49.616 --> 11:51.413
Oh, he's always after money,
our Sean. Come here.

11:51.484 --> 11:52.815
Ta.

11:53.953 --> 11:56.183
Um...

11:56.256 --> 11:57.655
Right, I want some change.

11:57.724 --> 11:58.452
Okay...

11:58.525 --> 12:00.857
I shouldn't be too long, right.
I'll be home in a bit.

12:00.927 --> 12:02.792
Mum... can I play out...
/Come straight home, bye.

12:02.862 --> 12:04.523
Yeah, of course you can.
Put your coat on.

12:06.666 --> 12:10.033
"...earn pounds at home.
Experienced machinists required...

12:10.103 --> 12:12.037
for making baby buggy hoods
and aprons."

12:12.105 --> 12:13.868
Aye, I wonder how much
that is?

12:13.940 --> 12:15.305
It's usually cash
in hand.

12:15.375 --> 12:17.673
I used to get 12p
an apron...

12:17.744 --> 12:21.680
and if I really was good,
you know, disciplined myself
and put the hours in...

12:21.748 --> 12:23.773
I'd get between ten and twelve
quid a day.

12:23.850 --> 12:25.374
Sounds like it'd do us,
that.

12:25.451 --> 12:27.112
You've got to be fast.

12:27.187 --> 12:28.654
I've not sewed
in ages.

12:28.721 --> 12:31.246
Soon get back into the swing
of things, don't you.

12:31.324 --> 12:32.450
Eh, mum...
/Yeah... yeah?

12:34.794 --> 12:36.955
An ambulance has just pulled up
outside Mrs Whittaker's house

12:37.564 --> 12:38.792
and the people in the chippy said
that she's took an overdose...

12:38.898 --> 12:39.796
Let's have a look.

12:50.677 --> 12:52.406
You know, it doesn't
surprise me, this.

12:52.478 --> 12:54.309
She got caught for doing
the meter.

12:54.380 --> 12:56.371
Did she?
/Yeah, about three weeks ago.

12:57.383 --> 12:58.975
You know, it gets you like that,
dunnit?

12:59.052 --> 13:00.883
Yeah, but throwing the towel
in's not the answer, is it?

13:00.954 --> 13:02.979
She's got three kids,
for Christ's sake.

13:03.590 --> 13:07.424
Mmm... it's funny how we start off,
innit, with all these big ideas...

13:07.493 --> 13:10.690
and you realise that things aren't
going to change...

13:10.763 --> 13:12.424
Well... no...

13:12.498 --> 13:14.295
Like Bob's prospects.

13:14.367 --> 13:15.664
When's he going to
get a job?

13:15.735 --> 13:18.727
Well, Tommy's like that, he's been
trying for ages, he's give up now.

13:20.173 --> 13:21.333
Do you know...

13:21.407 --> 13:24.069
I'll live and die in that flat and
nobody'll even know.

13:24.711 --> 13:26.736
But at least you're not on your
own, are you?

13:28.514 --> 13:30.880
I reckon we should
go out one night...

13:30.950 --> 13:33.248
and get ourselves a couple
of sugar daddies.

13:33.319 --> 13:33.910
Do you reckon?
/Yeah...

13:40.193 --> 13:42.388
Isn't it gorgeous?
/It's lovely.

13:43.129 --> 13:46.189
She looks like a princess.
/It's lovely, isn't it?

13:47.867 --> 13:49.129
Go on, Coleen,
give us a twirl.

13:51.504 --> 13:53.301
Oh, yeah... now walk up
and down.

13:55.408 --> 13:57.239
Put your hands together as if
you're going to the altar.

13:59.512 --> 14:00.740
Oh, she looks great.

14:01.314 --> 14:05.148
Twenty, thirty, forty, fifty,
sixty, seventy...

14:05.718 --> 14:08.744
seventy-five, eighty, ninety,
a hundred...

14:08.821 --> 14:10.948
and four pounds. I'll just
get your change.

14:15.828 --> 14:17.386
Keep close to the edge,
love.

14:26.606 --> 14:29.541
No, you're going too far
away from the edge.

14:29.609 --> 14:31.634
You're wasting too much
material, love.

14:31.711 --> 14:34.578
You've got to keep that edge,
keep it closer to the edge.

14:37.583 --> 14:40.416
Whoa! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, love! Come on!

14:40.486 --> 14:41.350
You're running riot!

14:41.421 --> 14:42.547
Try and keep as close to...

14:42.622 --> 14:44.590
I don't want any
wastage at all, love.

14:44.657 --> 14:46.056
What did you work
on before?

14:46.125 --> 14:47.490
Um... kid's coats.

14:47.560 --> 14:50.256
Kid's coats! My God, I bet you
had a lot of waste on them.

14:50.330 --> 14:51.763
Go on, then...

14:51.831 --> 14:52.593
whoa!

14:52.665 --> 14:53.131
What?

14:53.199 --> 14:54.632
Listen, love...

14:54.701 --> 14:56.794
...keep your edges together.
I want to keep it close.

14:56.869 --> 14:58.666
Lift your foot.
Lift the foot.

15:00.239 --> 15:01.297
It's you, you make
me nervous.

15:01.374 --> 15:03.774
You're making me ner...
you're making me nervous, love...

15:03.843 --> 15:05.606
...look at that wastage on that
material.

15:05.678 --> 15:07.202
Can make a belt out
of that.

15:07.280 --> 15:08.338
Just try...

15:08.414 --> 15:09.108
I'll be all right
once I get...

15:09.182 --> 15:11.616
Have you got a machine
at home?
/No, not yet.

15:11.684 --> 15:13.379
You haven't got one at home!
/No...

15:13.453 --> 15:14.920
Well how do you expect
to sew?

15:14.988 --> 15:16.580
Er... I'm going to
hire one.

15:16.656 --> 15:19.250
Well, I can't be working on that,
love. We need a job...

15:20.126 --> 15:21.423
...whoa, whoa, whoa
whoa!

15:21.494 --> 15:25.362
Girl! Bloody hell!
Gift the thing up!

15:26.699 --> 15:28.291
No, I'm sorry, love.
/What?

15:28.368 --> 15:31.496
I'm sorry, love. You haven't
got a clue, have you really, love?

15:31.571 --> 15:32.503
Er, yeah.
I'll try again...

15:32.572 --> 15:33.561
Come on, love.
/Why?

15:33.639 --> 15:35.106
I haven't got time to train
you, love.

15:35.174 --> 15:35.970
Well, give me a chance.

15:36.042 --> 15:39.102
No, go and practice on somebody
else's material, lovey.

15:39.178 --> 15:40.304
What?
/Off you go...

15:40.380 --> 15:41.608
here's your coat.
/When I'm at home
I'll be all right.

15:41.681 --> 15:43.478
Never mind.
Off you go.

15:43.549 --> 15:44.948
When you've got some
experience, come back.

15:45.018 --> 15:47.179
Off you go. Go on,
love, go on.

15:51.024 --> 15:52.616
Wasting my bloody time,
they do.

15:52.692 --> 15:54.956
They haven't got a clue
about bloody sewing machines!

15:58.998 --> 15:59.692
Right...

15:59.766 --> 16:03.031
I've got everything for the mince
pies, so I'm all right for that.
All right?

16:03.102 --> 16:03.568
Yeah.

16:03.636 --> 16:05.934
Um... want some bread.
/How many loaves?

16:06.005 --> 16:07.097
Two. Two loaves.

16:07.173 --> 16:08.265
Will that be enough?

16:08.341 --> 16:10.275
Yeah. Yeah, I've got
a bit in.

16:10.343 --> 16:11.571
Um...

16:11.644 --> 16:12.975
Boiled ham.

16:13.046 --> 16:15.844
Get some salmon paste...
yeah?

16:15.915 --> 16:17.246
Salmon paste...

16:17.316 --> 16:19.011
Yeah, Coleen likes that,
doesn't she?

16:19.819 --> 16:21.081
A big bag of crisps.

16:22.655 --> 16:23.713
Oh, coke...

16:23.790 --> 16:24.654
What about the booze?

16:24.724 --> 16:25.554
What about it?

16:25.625 --> 16:26.990
Have to get a bottle
of whisky.

16:27.060 --> 16:28.618
Don't have to get
a bottle nothing.

16:28.694 --> 16:30.662
I do. That bloody brother-in-law
of yours is coming.

16:30.730 --> 16:33.722
I'm not having that Tory-faced
pillock saying he never got a drink
in my house.

16:33.800 --> 16:34.425
Don't be daft.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.161
Give over. You know what
he's like.

16:50.083 --> 16:50.913
What's up?

16:51.684 --> 16:54.050
Nothing, love.
Nothing.

16:54.120 --> 16:55.087
Well, can you get
a move on?

16:55.154 --> 16:57.054
Yeah, I'll see you later
/AII right. See ya.

16:57.123 --> 16:58.090
Yeah. Ta-ta, love.

17:10.403 --> 17:11.700
Here we are.
Get it from here.

17:11.771 --> 17:13.932
Excuse me. Have you got a cake
with icing on, please?

17:16.209 --> 17:17.107
Is that big enough?

17:17.210 --> 17:19.075
Yeah, that'll be fine,
that. Yeah.

17:24.016 --> 17:26.211
Is that the lot or have you
got to get anything else?

17:26.285 --> 17:28.219
Sausage meat...

17:28.287 --> 17:29.754
Fancy a little bet?

17:29.822 --> 17:30.880
You what?

17:30.957 --> 17:33.118
I got a couple of tips last night
of Keith in the Carters' Arms.

17:33.192 --> 17:34.352
Go halves with me for
a Yankee bet?

17:34.427 --> 17:35.155
Keith?

17:35.228 --> 17:36.058
At the Carters'!

17:36.129 --> 17:38.256
Oh, sod Keith and the bets,
mate, listen...

17:39.599 --> 17:40.930
I'm up to me neck
in the shit.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.160
What with?

17:42.902 --> 17:44.130
Have a look at that.

17:47.707 --> 17:49.732
Oh, bloody hell,
lad...

17:50.443 --> 17:51.705
how much?

18:06.926 --> 18:08.450
You all right?
/Yep.

18:13.566 --> 18:14.726
Can you get that
for me?

18:18.738 --> 18:20.797
Your daddy in, sweetheart?
/No, me mum is.

18:21.507 --> 18:23.407
Mrs Williams?
/What are you doing?

18:23.476 --> 18:24.602
Nice to meet you, love.

18:24.677 --> 18:26.338
Look, you don't just come
barging in somebody's house...

18:26.412 --> 18:27.845
Fucking shut it!

18:27.914 --> 18:30.974
You got a dickhead for a husband
and he owes me money...

18:31.050 --> 18:32.449
You can't just come
in me house.

18:32.518 --> 18:34.110
...lots of it!

18:34.187 --> 18:35.415
Do you mean Bob?

18:35.488 --> 18:37.513
Ted, go up fucking stairs.
Have a look upstairs.

18:37.590 --> 18:39.182
You're not going up me stairs.
I've not got anything.

18:39.258 --> 18:40.520
No, you're not going up!

18:40.593 --> 18:41.685
Get out!

18:41.761 --> 18:42.955
Get out!

18:43.029 --> 18:43.927
Where is he?

18:43.996 --> 18:44.587
Look, get your...

18:44.664 --> 18:45.494
Where is he?

18:45.565 --> 18:47.294
I don't know where he is.
Get him down my stairs now!

18:47.366 --> 18:49.163
I told you, he owes
me money.

18:49.235 --> 18:51.396
Let me tell you the shit
you're in!

18:51.470 --> 18:52.198
Tell your mate to get
downstairs...

18:52.271 --> 18:56.002
He borrowed a hundred and fifty
pounds. It's there in black
and white.

18:56.075 --> 18:57.872
Look, he's not in.
All right.

18:57.944 --> 18:59.969
He borrowed a hundred
and fifty!

19:00.046 --> 19:00.944
Look...
/Shut up!

19:01.514 --> 19:03.345
The people he borrowed it
from...

19:03.416 --> 19:06.544
maintained it was for a Communion
dress or something for a young girl.

19:06.619 --> 19:08.314
Probably that little girl there,
was it?

19:08.888 --> 19:10.879
Paid four weeks,
then pissed off.

19:10.957 --> 19:11.616
Get out, will you!

19:11.691 --> 19:12.385
Done the vanishing act.

19:12.458 --> 19:13.049
He's not here!

19:13.125 --> 19:14.683
But not from me,
he doesn't!

19:14.760 --> 19:16.455
I bought the debt!

19:16.529 --> 19:17.791
Look, he's not here,
so you...

19:17.863 --> 19:21.765
And now he owes me!
And I get fucking paid.

19:22.435 --> 19:25.131
Don't come mithering me about
it, I don't know anything
about it.

19:25.204 --> 19:28.298
Altogether it's two hundred and
eighty-five pound.

19:28.374 --> 19:29.705
Will you tell him to...

19:29.775 --> 19:32.437
Two hundred and eighty five
pound, love, please.

19:32.511 --> 19:35.105
Two hundred... I've not got two
hundred and eighty-five pound!

19:35.181 --> 19:36.015
How much have
you got?

19:36.015 --> 19:36.743
Nothing.

19:36.816 --> 19:37.714
You must have something.

19:37.783 --> 19:38.977
I've not got anything!

19:39.051 --> 19:40.348
You must have something
in the house.

19:40.419 --> 19:42.182
Oh, can you stop him!

19:42.255 --> 19:43.620
You just stop it
in there!

19:43.689 --> 19:44.951
Anything upstairs, Ted?

19:45.024 --> 19:46.753
Look, he's gone and messed me
kitchen up.

19:46.826 --> 19:47.986
Ted, anything upstairs!

19:48.060 --> 19:49.152
No, fuck all!

19:49.795 --> 19:50.989
Let's have a look
at your fingers.

19:51.063 --> 19:52.257
No. You're not looking
at my fingers...

19:52.331 --> 19:55.129
Let me have a look
at your fingers!
/What for?

19:55.201 --> 19:56.566
Hold your fucking
hands out!
/No!

19:56.636 --> 19:58.194
Hold your hands out!!

19:59.972 --> 20:01.735
Take the rings off.
/No!!

20:01.807 --> 20:03.741
Take the rings off.

20:03.809 --> 20:05.606
This is me
wedding ring.

20:05.678 --> 20:06.906
Pretty daughter,
isn't it, that?

20:06.979 --> 20:08.810
You just leave her alone,
and just get out!

20:08.881 --> 20:10.178
Do you want her
to stay pretty?

20:10.249 --> 20:10.977
Just get out.

20:11.050 --> 20:14.315
Do you want her to stay
pretty? Take the fucking rings off!
Put them on the table.

20:14.387 --> 20:16.048
God... this isn't fair, this.
No.

20:16.122 --> 20:17.384
Take them off!

20:17.456 --> 20:19.890
If you don't,
he fucking will!

20:19.959 --> 20:22.621
Now take them off and
put them down there!

20:25.031 --> 20:26.396
I don't believe this!

20:26.465 --> 20:28.228
Money.
Where's your money?

20:28.301 --> 20:29.063
We haven't got any money.

20:29.135 --> 20:30.227
You must have some
fucking money.

20:30.303 --> 20:32.601
There's no money!
We're skint!

20:32.672 --> 20:33.696
Video?

20:35.441 --> 20:36.373
Where's your bag?

20:37.176 --> 20:38.006
I don't know.

20:38.077 --> 20:40.011
Where's your bag?

20:40.079 --> 20:41.307
Here Tansey,
in the kitchen.

20:41.380 --> 20:43.075
Oh just stop it, please,
get out!

20:43.149 --> 20:44.173
Get out!

20:44.250 --> 20:46.684
Get out of me house now!
Get out of it!

20:46.752 --> 20:47.810
Open this!

20:47.887 --> 20:49.878
Open it and give me
the money!

20:50.423 --> 20:51.321
Get the money out!

20:51.390 --> 20:52.049
There's nothing!

20:52.124 --> 20:53.250
Get the money out!

20:53.326 --> 20:55.123
There's nothing in me bag.
I haven't any money...

20:55.194 --> 20:57.594
You have no fucking money but
you're living off me!

20:57.663 --> 21:00.154
Whose, fucking money bought
this? Mine!

21:00.232 --> 21:01.699
Give me some money!

21:01.767 --> 21:03.166
I haven't got any.

21:03.235 --> 21:05.430
Open the fucking bag.
Let me see.

21:06.072 --> 21:06.731
There is no money.
I know...

21:06.806 --> 21:08.899
What's that!
What is that?
/Why...

21:08.974 --> 21:10.373
Take that out!

21:10.443 --> 21:11.842
Take that out!

21:11.911 --> 21:12.570
What for?

21:12.645 --> 21:13.543
Give it to me.

21:14.580 --> 21:15.604
Give it to me!
/That's me book...
I need...

21:15.681 --> 21:17.012
That'll fucking do
for starters.

21:17.083 --> 21:20.018
I'll be back for this when it's
fucking due every Monday...

21:20.086 --> 21:23.214
and you can tell that fucking
shit-house of a husband of yours...

21:23.289 --> 21:27.316
either he pays... we find him,
we'll cut his fucking bollocks off!

21:27.393 --> 21:28.223
What am I going
to do now?

21:28.294 --> 21:30.421
Then I'll come back and I'll
rip it out your fucking arse!

21:30.496 --> 21:31.724
Do you fucking understand
now, do you?

21:31.797 --> 21:32.764
Just please don't...

21:32.832 --> 21:35.699
Don't fuck about...
with US!!

21:36.769 --> 21:37.736
Now...

21:38.537 --> 21:41.836
...let him fucking know that
we'll be fucking back!

22:42.201 --> 22:43.133
Anne?

22:46.739 --> 22:47.535
Hi, love.

22:49.375 --> 22:52.401
Why didn't you tell me?
/Tell you what?

22:53.279 --> 22:55.372
You borrowed that money,
didn't you?

22:55.448 --> 22:58.144
You never come up on the horses.
You borrowed it!

22:59.018 --> 23:00.076
Oh, I'm sorry,
love.

23:03.022 --> 23:03.818
I'm sorry.

23:04.790 --> 23:06.690
Just get off!
/Tell me what happened?

23:08.994 --> 23:12.361
They said things! They were
really threatening. You should
have seen them.

23:12.431 --> 23:13.796
What did they say?

23:16.869 --> 23:17.801
They said...

23:19.572 --> 23:20.630
They said Coleen were...

23:21.474 --> 23:22.338
...was pretty.

23:23.409 --> 23:25.343
And did we want to keep
her like that?

23:26.312 --> 23:27.142
I'm sorry, love.

23:28.948 --> 23:30.415
Look, I'm sorry...
/It's all your fault!

23:31.517 --> 23:35.044
And they said they'd come
back and take it out on my
arse, that's what they said!

23:37.156 --> 23:38.054
Look, I'm sorry,
love...

23:38.123 --> 23:41.024
You've got no bleedin' right,
Bob! You really haven't.

23:42.928 --> 23:45.522
Look Anne, I'm just ducking and
weaving just trying to keep my
head above water...

23:45.598 --> 23:47.691
...trying to get what I can.
I'm sorry.

23:47.766 --> 23:49.461
You've got us all
in the shit now.

23:50.069 --> 23:51.434
It's all down to me.

23:52.671 --> 23:53.763
Oh God...

23:57.276 --> 23:58.834
We'll have to go the police. We're
going to have to do something!

23:58.911 --> 24:02.438
Oh, the police. They think we're
a load of tosspots to start with.

24:03.048 --> 24:05.915
Oh shit! Don't go.
Don't get it. Bob...

24:05.985 --> 24:07.145
Stay there.

24:07.219 --> 24:09.983
Just stay there.
/Bob...

24:14.927 --> 24:15.552
Mum...

24:15.628 --> 24:16.754
It's Coleen, love.
/Mum!

24:18.597 --> 24:19.427
Oh, Coleen...

24:19.498 --> 24:20.931
What the bloody hell's
going on, lad?

24:21.000 --> 24:23.560
Oh, Jesus! Look at the mess
in here.

24:23.636 --> 24:24.864
What's happening?

24:31.410 --> 24:32.570
They didn't hurt you,
did they love?

24:32.645 --> 24:34.112
Them men didn't hurt you,
did they?

24:34.179 --> 24:37.637
They took mummy's ring.

24:37.716 --> 24:40.150
Didn't they, mum?
They got the ring.

24:40.219 --> 24:41.151
Yeah...

24:41.220 --> 24:42.050
Are you all right now?

24:42.121 --> 24:43.486
What else did they do?

24:43.556 --> 24:45.820
They push me over
there and...

24:45.891 --> 24:48.655
...and they got mummy's family
allowance book.

24:48.727 --> 24:52.219
Hey, Coleen... when we've cleaned
your mum's kitchen up, shall
we make some more cakes...

24:52.298 --> 24:53.356
...for your party?

24:53.432 --> 24:54.592
Eh, shall we do that?

24:54.667 --> 24:55.691
You sit there.

24:55.768 --> 24:57.599
Where are you going now?
/I'm going out.

24:57.670 --> 24:59.035
Oh, don't be a dickhead!
/Bob!

24:59.572 --> 25:01.836
Bob... don't be a dickhead.

25:01.907 --> 25:03.067
Get out the fucking way,
right!

25:03.175 --> 25:04.073
Stop it!
/No!

25:04.143 --> 25:05.201
You're out of your
depth, lad!

25:05.277 --> 25:06.972
I need to do this. I'll fucking
sort it out my way.

25:07.046 --> 25:07.535
You stay here, Tommy...

25:07.613 --> 25:09.808
Bob, don't be a dickhead!
Think of these, lad.

25:09.882 --> 25:11.179
I'll fucking sort it
out my way!

25:11.250 --> 25:12.012
Bob...

25:13.085 --> 25:15.280
Bob!
/Leave it out,
will you, son.

25:50.222 --> 25:52.417
City lost again!
They want stuffing!

27:31.690 --> 27:33.021
Every week I get blamed...

27:33.092 --> 27:34.150
On your bike...

28:24.109 --> 28:25.804
You know me...
you know me...

28:29.448 --> 28:30.938
Tansey, are we going
for a flutter...

28:31.016 --> 28:33.314
Please. Let me come
with you.
/No, no...

28:33.385 --> 28:34.352
Let me come!

28:34.419 --> 28:35.443
Where you going...
where are you going...

28:35.521 --> 28:37.148
Are we cabbing
it tonight?

28:44.797 --> 28:47.163
Tansey, come on.
Come with us, man.

28:47.232 --> 28:49.257
I'm away. I'm away.
/No, come with us.

28:49.334 --> 28:51.700
I'm away,
get yourselves away.

28:51.770 --> 28:54.238
Do me a fucking favour,
get yourselves...

28:54.306 --> 28:55.500
...have a good night,
I'm away.

28:56.175 --> 28:56.698
See you...

28:56.775 --> 28:58.140
See you. Look after her.
Look after her.

28:58.210 --> 29:00.201
I'm away. See you.
Take care.

30:01.740 --> 30:02.604
Tansey!

30:03.642 --> 30:04.336
Who's that?

30:05.177 --> 30:06.474
What the fucking hell are
you doing here?

30:06.545 --> 30:08.706
You called.
/What?

30:08.780 --> 30:11.214
You came to my house and
frightened the fucking life out
of my wife and kid.

30:11.283 --> 30:12.181
What you fucking
talking about?

30:12.251 --> 30:13.650
You know what I'm
talking about.

30:13.719 --> 30:16.017
You owed me money.
/Yeah, that's why I'm here.

30:16.088 --> 30:17.020
Come on.

30:18.223 --> 30:18.985
Into that, are we?

30:19.057 --> 30:20.388
With fucking folks like you,
I am. Yeah.

30:20.459 --> 30:21.551
Come on. Keep coming.

30:21.627 --> 30:22.059
Listen...

30:22.127 --> 30:23.025
Just keep coming...

30:23.095 --> 30:24.995
Listen, you're gonna want
somebody, aren't you?

30:25.063 --> 30:26.496
You're going to want somebody
to look after you...
/Just keep coming.

30:26.565 --> 30:27.657
...help you get out the shit
that you're in.

30:27.733 --> 30:28.461
Just keep coming...

30:28.533 --> 30:30.330
Somebody who can
help you financially.
/Just keep coming.

30:30.402 --> 30:31.960
I'll look after you...
I'll look after you...

30:32.571 --> 30:34.505
Ah, fuck you! See you when
I'm sober...

30:43.448 --> 30:45.643
I want that fucking book you've
got with my name in it.

30:45.717 --> 30:47.912
You're fucking dead!
/I'm already dead!

30:47.986 --> 30:49.578
And what I haven't got,
you can't take from me!

30:49.655 --> 30:51.145
I want that book
with my name in it.

30:51.223 --> 30:52.884
Crazy fucking bastard!

30:52.958 --> 30:54.550
I want that book
with my name in!

30:55.260 --> 30:56.227
I want that book!

31:00.265 --> 31:04.599
Tomorrow, you fucking arsehole,
I'm coming for your arse...

31:04.670 --> 31:08.003
...and I'm going to shag your
wife's arse off!

31:10.309 --> 31:11.071
You bastard!

31:19.718 --> 31:20.878
You bastard!

31:47.913 --> 31:48.777
Book...

33:05.524 --> 33:07.788
Bob?
/I'm in trouble, Father.

33:07.859 --> 33:08.826
What do you mean?

33:09.728 --> 33:10.387
Come in.

33:23.975 --> 33:27.604
What is it, Bob?
What's happening...

33:29.548 --> 33:31.072
Sit yourself down.

33:38.457 --> 33:39.253
What's up?

33:39.891 --> 33:41.324
I'm in terrible trouble,
Father.

33:42.360 --> 33:43.520
What kind of trouble?

33:43.595 --> 33:45.722
I've been responsible
for a man's death.

33:47.032 --> 33:49.330
You... you killed someone?

33:49.401 --> 33:51.631
No, it was an accident.
An accident.

33:51.703 --> 33:53.000
I didn't mean to.

33:53.872 --> 33:55.499
To a man named Tansey.

33:56.241 --> 33:58.937
The loan shark?
/Yeah...

34:00.812 --> 34:02.973
You fought with him?
/Yeah...

34:04.883 --> 34:08.444
About what?
/Money.

34:09.987 --> 34:11.216
You borrowed from him?

34:12.056 --> 34:14.525
No. I borrowed
from a loan company...

34:15.127 --> 34:16.594
...but I couldn't keep
the payments up...

34:17.161 --> 34:18.789
...and Tansey got hold of
the debts.

34:19.431 --> 34:22.092
That's what he does.
Debts and drugs.

34:22.167 --> 34:23.862
So I heard.

34:23.935 --> 34:27.199
How much?
/A hundred and fifty pound.

34:27.772 --> 34:32.572
To pay for Coleen's dress?
/Yes, it was the only way.

34:32.643 --> 34:35.737
Bob... I thought
you had more sense.

34:37.815 --> 34:39.511
Hold your horses
there for a second.

35:15.086 --> 35:16.553
I took these out of
his pocket.

35:18.256 --> 35:18.950
What is it?

35:19.925 --> 35:21.688
It's the book
with all the names in.

35:21.760 --> 35:23.125
That's the money
they all owe.

35:24.229 --> 35:27.255
And if... if they don't pay he
goes round and breaks their legs.

35:27.332 --> 35:28.890
That's why the call him
the Collector.

35:30.302 --> 35:32.497
I boil up inside,
sometimes I get angry.

35:33.104 --> 35:34.401
But I'm a grafter.

35:34.472 --> 35:35.666
I know that.

35:35.740 --> 35:39.642
I get up every morning and go
looking for work, wherever it is...

35:40.845 --> 35:42.312
I'm a good Catholic,
Father.

35:43.014 --> 35:45.278
I go to church, I believe in
God, I pray...

35:45.350 --> 35:48.046
but it doesn't put food
on the table.

35:50.322 --> 35:51.448
When did this happen?

35:51.523 --> 35:53.115
About an hour ago.

35:53.191 --> 35:54.783
So he's still lying
in the car?

35:54.859 --> 35:56.190
As far as I know, yeah.

35:56.261 --> 35:57.592
Does anyone else
know about it?

35:57.662 --> 35:58.356
No.

35:58.430 --> 36:00.295
Just us?
/Yeah...

36:02.300 --> 36:03.927
What are you going to do
about it, Bob?

36:04.469 --> 36:07.165
I'm going to have to go
the police, what else can I do?

36:07.239 --> 36:11.198
But I don't... I don't want them
going round telling Anne
and Coleen...

36:11.276 --> 36:13.267
...I want you to do that, Father,
please.

36:13.345 --> 36:15.836
I want you to do it
because I can't.

36:17.015 --> 36:19.779
I can't...
/Why should you?

36:19.851 --> 36:20.909
What?

36:20.986 --> 36:22.681
Tell Anne.

36:23.355 --> 36:24.379
Tansey's dead.

36:24.456 --> 36:25.684
Fuck Tansey!

36:26.625 --> 36:29.458
May God have mercy on his soul.
You didn't kill him.

36:29.527 --> 36:31.119
No. It was an accident.

36:31.196 --> 36:32.857
Yes, it was an accident.

36:32.931 --> 36:36.332
So why sacrifice your freedom
and the happiness of your family?

36:37.669 --> 36:40.137
There's lots of good people
on this Estate...

36:40.205 --> 36:43.368
...will sleep easier in their beds
because of his passing.

36:43.441 --> 36:46.035
They were afraid of him, Father.
They were afraid of him.

36:48.313 --> 36:50.907
You came to me
for advice and help.

36:51.883 --> 36:53.748
Then stay away from
the police.

36:53.818 --> 36:56.582
Go home and pray for Tansey's
worthless soul.

36:57.188 --> 36:59.554
Say nothing to Anne
or to anyone.

37:01.359 --> 37:03.190
First thing we do is get rid
of this lot.

37:21.246 --> 37:23.009
You're not an evil
man, Bob.

37:23.748 --> 37:26.444
People like yourself are
hungering for justice...

37:26.518 --> 37:30.113
in the name of Christ who was
himself the bread of life...

37:30.188 --> 37:31.485
you deserve it.

37:32.624 --> 37:34.148
Now I'll hear
your confession.

37:46.738 --> 37:49.673
In the name of the Father and
the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
amen.

37:52.344 --> 37:53.276
Forgive me Father...

37:54.279 --> 37:55.211
for I have sinned.

37:56.381 --> 37:57.609
Over in that corner
there...
/Coleen?

37:57.682 --> 37:59.809
Hey, lads...
/Coleen!

37:59.884 --> 38:02.011
Do you mind standing over
in that corner there, please.

38:02.087 --> 38:04.521
Just over here.
Come on, lads.

38:09.694 --> 38:11.491
Everyone line up just there.
That's the idea.

38:11.563 --> 38:12.894
Just over there a little
bit, son.

38:14.132 --> 38:16.760
Now, just come a bit closer in.
That's it, and lift baby up.

38:16.835 --> 38:18.063
Just behave yourself.

38:18.603 --> 38:22.198
I know you don't want to be
here but just behave yourself.

38:22.273 --> 38:23.103
Right.

38:28.346 --> 38:29.472
What, you got
problems, mate?

38:29.547 --> 38:30.411
Just a minute...

38:31.449 --> 38:32.575
Did you hear about
Tansey?

38:32.650 --> 38:35.346
I believe he became unstuck
in a car crash.

38:35.420 --> 38:37.183
Unstuck! He's as dead
as a bloody dodo!

38:37.255 --> 38:38.051
How did it happen?

38:38.123 --> 38:40.057
Just run into a concrete wall
or something.

38:40.125 --> 38:40.955
Pissed?

38:41.025 --> 38:42.492
Stoned out of his head,
I believe.

38:42.560 --> 38:44.357
Couldn't have happened
to a nicer fella.

38:44.429 --> 38:45.896
Mr Williams can I have your
attention, please.

38:45.964 --> 38:47.022
...just face the camera.

38:47.098 --> 38:48.065
Now everybody a big
smile...

38:48.133 --> 38:49.327
I've seen more life
in a sick note!

38:49.401 --> 38:50.333
Come on, everybody!

38:51.069 --> 38:56.029
One, two... Mr. Williams...
Mr. Williams!

38:56.608 --> 38:57.632
Bob, stop it!

38:57.709 --> 38:58.676
Mr. Williams...

38:58.743 --> 39:00.370
...now face the camera,
that's the idea...

39:00.445 --> 39:01.434
...after three, a big smile...

39:01.513 --> 39:04.710
one... two...
three... cheese!

39:04.783 --> 39:05.909
Mr. Williams?

39:25.270 --> 39:27.101
The day before
He suffered...

39:27.172 --> 39:29.606
He took bread
in his sacred hands...

39:29.674 --> 39:32.802
and looking up to Heaven, to you,
His Almighty Father...

39:32.877 --> 39:34.902
He gave you
thanks and praise.

39:34.979 --> 39:38.779
He broke the bread, gave it
to his disciples and said...

39:39.417 --> 39:42.284
"Take this all of
you and eat it...

39:42.353 --> 39:45.811
this is my body which will be
given up for you."

39:55.133 --> 39:57.465
When supper was ended
He took the cup...

39:57.535 --> 39:59.730
again He gave you thanks
and praise...

39:59.804 --> 40:02.466
gave the cup to His disciples
and said...

40:02.540 --> 40:05.771
"take this all of you and
drink from it...

40:05.844 --> 40:07.869
this is the cup
of my blood...

40:07.946 --> 40:10.574
the blood of the new and
everlasting covenant...

40:10.648 --> 40:13.242
it will be shed for you
and for all men...

40:13.318 --> 40:15.252
so that sins maybe forgiven."

40:25.163 --> 40:25.891
Yes?

40:25.964 --> 40:26.623
Hello, love.

40:26.698 --> 40:28.689
Does, er, Mr. Robert Williams
live here?

40:28.766 --> 40:30.461
Yeah. But he's not
here.

40:30.535 --> 40:32.127
Can you tell me when
he may be back?

40:32.203 --> 40:34.501
Well, I don't know. He's gone
to church. Why?

40:34.572 --> 40:36.540
Does he own a green
Transit van...

40:36.608 --> 40:38.303
...BRJ 563Y?

40:38.376 --> 40:39.934
Yeah, but it's been stolen.

40:40.011 --> 40:42.741
Well, we've found it.
It's in the police pound
at Collyhurst.

40:42.814 --> 40:45.510
I wonder if you'd give him
a message, ask him to collect it.

41:16.648 --> 41:17.808
The body of Christ...

41:18.516 --> 41:19.505
Amen...

41:20.305 --> 41:26.825
