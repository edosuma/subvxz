WEBVTT

00:01.034 --> 00:02.334
Adult adam: <i> Back in the '80s,</i>
<i> they combined</i>

00:02.336 --> 00:05.671
<i> The two greatest things</i>
<i> in the world...</i>
<i> Music and television.</i>

00:05.673 --> 00:07.706
<i> We all remember our</i>
<i> favorite veejays</i>

00:07.708 --> 00:10.075
<i> Introducing the coolest videos</i>
<i> on a constant loop.</i>

00:10.077 --> 00:12.244
<i> The budgets were</i>
<i> as high as the hair,</i>

00:12.246 --> 00:14.947
<i> And the animation ranged</i>
<i> from dancing cats</i>

00:14.949 --> 00:16.482
<i> To hunky cartoon boyfriends.</i>

00:16.484 --> 00:20.719
<i> And no one was more addicted</i>
<i> to it than me and my sister.</i>

00:20.721 --> 00:22.388
I can't decide whether
that guy's hotter

00:22.390 --> 00:23.389
As a human
or a cartoon.

00:23.391 --> 00:26.725
If jessica rabbit
taught us anything...
Cartoon.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.627
I mean, what did we even do
before mtv existed?

00:28.629 --> 00:32.564
I think we just listened
to music like animals.

00:33.333 --> 00:33.866
Hey!
Get out!

00:33.868 --> 00:37.236
You've been watching
this music mtv television
for six hours.

00:37.238 --> 00:39.304
Enough is enough.
Go do your homework.

00:39.306 --> 00:42.107
Well, if you think about it,
I'm gonna be a musician,

00:42.109 --> 00:43.275
So this is my homework.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.977
And if you really think
about it,

00:44.979 --> 00:46.779
My life's passion
is making films,

00:46.781 --> 00:48.013
So this is
my homework, too.

00:48.015 --> 00:49.581
Well, my passion
is snuggies,

00:49.583 --> 00:50.716
Which I'm gonna
shower you with

00:50.718 --> 00:51.917
If you don't leave
right now.

00:51.919 --> 00:54.319
Go before I kiss
your belly.

00:54.321 --> 00:55.687
(makes kissing sound)

00:55.689 --> 00:57.489
And you...
Have you even looked

00:57.491 --> 00:59.324
At the college catalogs
I brought you?

00:59.326 --> 01:00.359
Actually, I have,

01:00.361 --> 01:02.094
And I've narrowed it down
to my top choices.

01:02.096 --> 01:06.098
(laughing) oh, yes!
It's happening!

01:06.100 --> 01:07.032
You're growing up.

01:07.034 --> 01:10.102
Oh, no. It's happening.
I'm not ready for this.

01:10.104 --> 01:12.371
Make time stop.
Make it stop!

01:12.373 --> 01:12.738
Focus!

01:12.740 --> 01:16.108
Okay, one option is
the london conservatory
of music.

01:16.110 --> 01:16.909
Ocean between us.
Pass.

01:16.911 --> 01:19.678
There's also an awesome
music program at ucla.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.046
Country between us.
Pass.

01:21.048 --> 01:22.014
Boston school of music.

01:22.016 --> 01:23.348
A connecticut between us.
Pass.

01:23.350 --> 01:25.384
Mom.
What about something
here in town,

01:25.386 --> 01:28.287
Like the prestigious
jenkintown funk academy?

01:28.289 --> 01:30.756
That's
the dance studio/karate dojo

01:30.758 --> 01:31.690
Next to
the mattress store.

01:31.692 --> 01:34.660
(sighs) there's got to be
something within
driving distance.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.228
Well, I guess juilliard
is in new york.

01:36.230 --> 01:38.764
That's my dream school,
but no one gets in.

01:38.766 --> 01:39.832
(gasps)

01:39.834 --> 01:40.933
We're going
to juilliard.

01:40.935 --> 01:44.002
Okay, stop.
That's the best school
in the country.

01:44.004 --> 01:45.604
Best for you,
closest for me.

01:45.606 --> 01:46.939
I am gonna
make this happen.

01:46.941 --> 01:50.042
I'm not getting in.
We're going
to juilliard.

01:50.044 --> 01:51.210
It's impossible.

01:51.212 --> 01:54.012
We're going
to juilliard!

01:55.148 --> 01:56.248
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

01:56.250 --> 02:00.652
<i> ¶ but nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:02.322 --> 02:03.455
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

02:03.457 --> 02:07.493
<i> ¶ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

02:07.495 --> 02:09.895
Adult adam:
<i> It was may 6, 1980-something.</i>

02:09.897 --> 02:11.864
<i> The school day was going off</i>
<i> without a hitch,</i>

02:11.866 --> 02:15.601
<i> All thanks to the watchful eye</i>
<i> of principal earl ball.</i>

02:15.603 --> 02:17.703
Let's go, youngsters.

02:17.705 --> 02:18.604
Activate those legs

02:18.606 --> 02:21.874
So we can activate
those minds.

02:21.876 --> 02:23.709
Ooh, yes.

02:23.711 --> 02:27.412
That's definitely going
into earl's pearls.

02:27.414 --> 02:30.282
(clattering)
(banging)

02:31.017 --> 02:32.451
(gasps) oh.

02:32.453 --> 02:33.285
Hello there, sir.

02:33.287 --> 02:35.320
Um, there was a spill
in science lab.

02:35.322 --> 02:36.321
And we needed a mop.

02:36.323 --> 02:39.358
We were kissing.
She's pretty.

02:39.859 --> 02:41.927
Why did you call me
when it's usually my wife

02:41.929 --> 02:43.729
Who handles this
annoying school crap?

02:43.731 --> 02:45.931
Well, truthfully,
I couldn't reach her.

02:45.933 --> 02:46.999
And more truthfully,

02:47.001 --> 02:49.034
I didn't try
because she scares me.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.202
Bill: Sorry, I'm late.

02:50.204 --> 02:52.271
We're having a sale
down at the...

02:52.273 --> 02:54.106
Son of a bitch.

02:54.108 --> 02:54.773
Oh, this guy.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.375
Adult adam: <i> And that guy</i>
<i> was lainey's dad,</i>

02:56.377 --> 02:58.844
<i> My father's archenemy,</i>
<i> bill lewis.</i>

02:58.846 --> 03:00.779
Look, I called
you both in here today

03:00.781 --> 03:04.149
Because we need to talk
about what's going on
with your kids.

03:04.151 --> 03:04.983
There's nothing going on,

03:04.985 --> 03:07.920
Because I very clearly
and emphatically forbade it.

03:07.922 --> 03:09.588
Well, for the third time
this week,

03:09.590 --> 03:11.690
I caught them canoodling
in secret.

03:11.692 --> 03:12.558
It's unacceptable.

03:12.560 --> 03:16.228
We have a saying in texas.
"don't blame the armadillo.

03:16.230 --> 03:17.563
"blame the armadillo's
dumb father."

03:17.565 --> 03:22.000
(scoffs) we have
a saying here...
You're bald.

03:22.002 --> 03:24.403
I'll have you know,
the ladies love it.

03:24.405 --> 03:25.537
Eh?
Ball: Okay.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.639
What is happening here
right now?

03:27.641 --> 03:28.941
I'll tell you
what's happening.

03:28.943 --> 03:31.677
This schmuck lives
in philadelphia,

03:31.679 --> 03:34.713
Yet he roots
for the dallas cowboys.

03:34.715 --> 03:35.447
Who does that?

03:35.449 --> 03:38.951
Red-blooded americans,
that's who does that.

03:38.953 --> 03:40.252
Got to say,
it surprises me,

03:40.254 --> 03:43.055
This friction that exists
between the two of you,

03:43.057 --> 03:45.324
Considering
how similar you are.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.058
Please.
Come on.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.827
No, no, no.
For example,
you're both fathers.

03:48.829 --> 03:51.063
You're both
small-business owners.

03:51.065 --> 03:52.564
You both seem very angry.

03:52.566 --> 03:53.665
That is true.
I'll give you that.

03:53.667 --> 03:54.700
And you're both
football fans.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.935
Now, this is a bond
which I can respect

03:56.937 --> 04:00.606
As a lifelong fan of
the new york football giants.

04:00.608 --> 04:01.773
Whoa,
you're a giants fan?

04:01.775 --> 04:04.076
Why the hell do you
live in philadelphia?

04:04.078 --> 04:05.010
He's got a point.

04:05.012 --> 04:07.412
Unlike the giants
last season.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.414
(both laugh)

04:09.416 --> 04:10.349
For your information,

04:10.351 --> 04:14.653
We won the conference
last year, so suck it!

04:15.421 --> 04:20.626
So what I actually
mean to say is
that it's always easier

04:20.628 --> 04:21.860
To get along...

04:21.862 --> 04:23.996
Than be short
with each other.

04:23.998 --> 04:26.231
And that is
one of earl's pearls

04:26.233 --> 04:27.766
You can take to the bank.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.435
Well, thank you
for your wise advice

04:30.437 --> 04:33.038
And, uh,
the giants suck.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.006
Yeah.

04:34.008 --> 04:35.974
They suck so hard.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.410
But good luck
next season.

04:38.745 --> 04:40.245
Oops.

04:44.484 --> 04:47.286
Adult adam: <i> That day,</i>
<i> my dad and bill lewis</i>
<i> discovered</i>

04:47.288 --> 04:48.887
<i> Their mutual hatred</i>
<i> of the giants</i>

04:48.889 --> 04:51.256
<i> Wasn't the only thing</i>
<i> they had in common.</i>

04:51.258 --> 04:52.124
What are
you doing here?

04:52.126 --> 04:53.692
Everyone knows
it's the best bar

04:53.694 --> 04:55.360
Across the street
from the school.

04:55.362 --> 04:57.429
Do you know how
I discovered this place?

04:57.431 --> 04:59.264
Last year's
christmas concert...

04:59.266 --> 05:00.365
I bailed at intermission.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.834
You lasted a lot longer
than I did.

05:02.836 --> 05:03.268
Woof!

05:03.270 --> 05:06.571
Forty kids playing
<i> jingle bells</i> on the clarinet?

05:06.573 --> 05:09.207
I mean, how does that
ever end well?

05:09.209 --> 05:11.076
I'll tell you
how it ends...

05:11.078 --> 05:12.110
With five of these,
bill.

05:12.112 --> 05:14.646
(both laugh)
you got that right,
murray.

05:14.648 --> 05:18.283
Hey. Bill murray,
like the ghostbuster.
(both laugh)

05:18.285 --> 05:20.752
That's funny.
I love bill murray.

05:20.754 --> 05:21.486
Oh, he's the best.

05:21.488 --> 05:24.122
Remember,
uh, <i> caddyshack?</i>
Yeah.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.624
(mimicking carl spackler)
"cinderella story.

05:25.626 --> 05:29.394
"used to be a greenskeeper,
about to be masters champion.

05:29.396 --> 05:30.829
"got about an eight iron,
I think.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.698
"it's in the hole."
(both laugh)

05:32.700 --> 05:35.100
"it's in the hole.
I'm in 'stripes'."

05:35.102 --> 05:37.202
(in normal voice)
wow. That is terrible.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.704
Yeah.
Impressions aren't my thing.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.640
(mimicking carl spackler)
"well, at least you got
that going for you."

05:41.642 --> 05:44.543
<i> As my dad started to break</i>
<i> the ice with his arch nemesis,</i>

05:44.545 --> 05:46.144
<i> My mom was heating up</i>
<i> her quest</i>

05:46.146 --> 05:49.247
<i> To make erica's dream</i>
<i> of juilliard come true.</i>

05:49.249 --> 05:50.615
Mrs. Goldberg,
I understand

05:50.617 --> 05:52.117
That the college
admissions process

05:52.119 --> 05:54.519
Can be
a very scary journey.

05:54.521 --> 05:57.255
The best thing I can say is
I'm scared, too.

05:57.257 --> 05:59.791
Honestly,
it is hard out there.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.193
Wow.
That's your opening?

06:01.195 --> 06:03.729
I'm sorry. I've been up
for the past 26 hours.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.464
I have a sick parrot
at home.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.733
Well, the good news is,
we've narrowed down

06:07.735 --> 06:09.768
Our top choice
to juilliard.

06:09.770 --> 06:10.502
I know it's a long shot,

06:10.504 --> 06:12.904
But do you think
I have a chance
of getting in?

06:12.906 --> 06:13.505
Absolutely.

06:13.507 --> 06:16.608
Erica, you can do
anything that you set
your mind to.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.777
It's like
my posters say...

06:18.779 --> 06:20.645
"keep reaching
for the stars."

06:20.647 --> 06:22.080
"hang in there."

06:22.082 --> 06:23.582
And that's the band rush.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.584
That's because
I'm the cool
guidance counselor

06:25.586 --> 06:27.886
Who shows up at
the school basketball games

06:27.888 --> 06:29.154
In a casual polo.

06:29.156 --> 06:31.123
See, erica?
This can happen.

06:31.125 --> 06:32.124
This is so cool.
(laughs)

06:32.126 --> 06:34.960
Well, I'm gonna go
work on my audition.
Thanks, mom.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.361
(chuckles)
oh, that's the spirit.

06:36.363 --> 06:39.498
You can do
anything you want.
Anything at...

06:39.500 --> 06:41.933
Ah, yeah,
she ain't gonna get in.

06:41.935 --> 06:42.801
Excuse me?

06:42.803 --> 06:44.669
Look, erica is
very talented,

06:44.671 --> 06:47.806
But juilliard is
another level, okay?

06:47.808 --> 06:50.542
They only take
the best of the best.

06:50.544 --> 06:51.910
And that's my daughter.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.478
Okay, let me break it down
for you.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.348
Imagine all
of the best people...

06:56.350 --> 06:57.048
In a room.

06:57.050 --> 07:00.352
They only pick the best
of those best people.

07:00.354 --> 07:01.386
My daughter.
Okay.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.488
Maybe I'm not
making myself clear.

07:03.490 --> 07:05.357
We start with the best.
My daughter.

07:05.359 --> 07:06.391
Not just
at this school...

07:06.393 --> 07:09.194
But of all the people...
The whole world.

07:09.196 --> 07:13.165
They only pick the best
of those best people.

07:13.167 --> 07:14.299
So, when can we take
a tour?

07:14.301 --> 07:16.067
You know, maybe a visual aid
might help you

07:16.069 --> 07:18.570
Understand this
a little bit better.

07:21.674 --> 07:25.777
This is patty snitzenberg.
She wrote this piece.

07:26.846 --> 07:28.914
She carved the cello.

07:29.715 --> 07:31.416
She's also blind.

07:31.651 --> 07:32.484
And they rejected her

07:32.486 --> 07:34.686
Like the cold
sons of bitches
that they are.

07:34.688 --> 07:38.590
Well, erica is getting
into juilliard.
You want to know why?

07:38.592 --> 07:41.326
'cause I will
make it happen.
(chuckles)

07:41.328 --> 07:44.062
You don't know the things
I've done for my children.

07:44.064 --> 07:44.930
You don't want to know.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.865
I kind of want to know.
You cannot know.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.067
Look,
this has to happen.

07:49.069 --> 07:51.336
I convinced her to apply.
I gave her hope.

07:51.338 --> 07:54.306
Yeah, I used to have
a hope poster
up there, too.

07:54.308 --> 07:56.241
Then I realized
it was giving the kids

07:56.243 --> 07:57.008
Too much unrealistic hope.

07:57.010 --> 08:00.445
Adult adam:
<i> But with my mom in charge,</i>
<i> we didn't need hope.</i>

08:00.447 --> 08:04.049
<i> Meanwhile, my dad</i>
<i> was charged up</i>
<i> on his new friendship.</i>

08:04.051 --> 08:05.884
Look at
you handsome fellas.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.986
The hell's the matter
with you?

08:07.988 --> 08:08.553
Yeah.

08:08.555 --> 08:10.989
You seem happy
when you should be
super angry with me.

08:10.991 --> 08:11.957
Nah.
You're a cute kid.

08:11.959 --> 08:14.793
What?
Okay,
what's going on here?

08:14.795 --> 08:16.428
Nothing. I just had lunch
with bill lewis.

08:16.430 --> 08:19.531
You know, once you get past
the shiny head...
Not so awful.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.099
Oh, my god.
You're friends now?

08:21.101 --> 08:23.335
Let's not get crazy.
This is amazing!

08:23.337 --> 08:25.904
If mr. Lewis likes you,
then he'll like me.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.706
I'm proud of you,
mur.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.307
Never thought
I'd see the day

08:29.309 --> 08:30.342
Where you made
a friend.

08:30.344 --> 08:32.043
What are you talking about?
I got friends.

08:32.045 --> 08:33.645
Name one.
Vic.

08:33.647 --> 08:34.279
He's your employee.

08:34.281 --> 08:35.847
You pay him
to be around you.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.649
What about deli guy?
Love deli guy.

08:37.651 --> 08:41.019
You only love him
'cause he gives you
corned beef.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.320
Do you even know
what he looks like?

08:42.322 --> 08:46.157
Yeah, deli guy.
You know, uh,
wears an apron.

08:46.159 --> 08:46.992
Goes like this.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.560
Barry: (sighs)
face it, dad.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.161
This is your
first real friend.

08:50.163 --> 08:51.429
So, when are you
hanging out next?

08:51.431 --> 08:54.099
Okay, he's just a guy
I had lunch with.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.433
It's no big deal.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.235
(telephone rings)

08:57.237 --> 08:58.737
Hello?

08:58.739 --> 08:59.604
Hold on.

08:59.606 --> 09:00.705
(whispers) it's him.

09:00.707 --> 09:01.339
Play it cool.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.909
Tell him you're
on the other line
with another friend.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.977
Get out of here.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.245
Hey, bill.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.514
Yeah. Nothing.
Just, uh...

09:09.516 --> 09:12.484
Watching the tube.
(sighs)

09:12.852 --> 09:14.119
Are you kidding?

09:14.121 --> 09:16.621
I love cheesesteaks.

09:17.356 --> 09:17.789
Barry!

09:17.791 --> 09:20.392
Get off the phone.
I can hear you breathing.

09:20.394 --> 09:21.660
(whispers) ask him
how he's feeling,

09:21.662 --> 09:23.528
Then compliment
his telephone voice.
Barry!

09:23.530 --> 09:27.165
Adult adam:
<i> As my dad made plans</i>
<i> with his new best friend,</i>

09:27.167 --> 09:28.199
<i> My mom had her own plan</i>

09:28.201 --> 09:31.069
<i> To make erica look</i>
<i> like the best of the best.</i>

09:31.071 --> 09:31.970
<i> Hi, juilliard admissions</i>
<i> board.</i>

09:31.972 --> 09:34.539
<i> I'm erica goldberg from</i>
<i> jenkintown, pennsylvania.</i>

09:34.541 --> 09:36.741
<i> And I'm going</i>
<i> to play...</i>
<i> Cut.</i>

09:36.743 --> 09:39.144
Cut.
That's a cut.

09:39.146 --> 09:39.744
No, not "cut."

09:39.746 --> 09:41.780
I'm in the middle
of my juilliard audition.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.281
Hon, I love the spirit
and the passion

09:43.283 --> 09:44.683
And everything
you're doing here,

09:44.685 --> 09:47.552
But it's, like,
"gag me with a spoon."

09:47.554 --> 09:49.721
Sorry, do you kids
still say that?

09:49.723 --> 09:50.388
We never really did.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.257
You need a video
that stands out,

09:52.259 --> 09:55.594
Like the ones on your
mtv music television.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.929
Ooh, I like
where you're
heading here.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.398
We're talking
crazy camera angles,

10:00.400 --> 10:02.601
Pyrotechnics,
jiggly girls.

10:02.603 --> 10:05.570
Everyone loves
jiggly girls.

10:06.505 --> 10:07.606
We'll put a pin
in that one.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.641
Guys, juilliard is
a serious place.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.843
I just need
to showcase my voice.

10:11.845 --> 10:12.510
You said it yourself...

10:12.512 --> 10:16.414
Mtv is the way
people want to experience
music these days.

10:16.416 --> 10:17.182
Sure, you can sing.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.850
But we also want
show them

10:18.852 --> 10:20.518
That you're a star
like madonna.

10:20.520 --> 10:21.720
But you
really are a virgin.

10:21.722 --> 10:24.089
Say you're a virgin.
Actually, no,
don't tell me.

10:24.091 --> 10:27.425
I guess a cool audition tape
would kind of make me
stand out.

10:27.427 --> 10:30.562
You focus on your music
and leave the rest to us.

10:30.564 --> 10:31.529
Yeah.

10:31.531 --> 10:32.797
By the time we're done,

10:32.799 --> 10:34.899
Juilliard will be
begging you to go.

10:34.901 --> 10:37.135
Just trust mama.
Erica:
Nothing crazy.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.304
(chuckles)
you got it, schmoopie.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.705
We got to figure out
how to get

10:40.707 --> 10:43.141
A white stallion
down here.

10:43.143 --> 10:46.344
Adult adam:
<i> It was Saturday afternoon,</i>
<i> and my dad was about to take</i>

10:46.346 --> 10:49.514
<i> His friendship with bill lewis</i>
<i> to the next level.</i>

10:49.516 --> 10:50.248
I'm going out.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.850
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.918
Going where? Dmv?

10:53.920 --> 10:54.552
Car wash?

10:54.554 --> 10:56.488
Picking up trash
on the highway?

10:56.490 --> 10:57.822
I'm meeting bill lewis.

10:57.824 --> 10:58.423
Exactly.

10:58.425 --> 11:00.258
This is the first time
you're hanging out

11:00.260 --> 11:01.593
With your new,
special friend.

11:01.595 --> 11:03.061
You're looking
like a Monday morning

11:03.063 --> 11:04.496
When I need you
to look like
a Friday night.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.031
I usually sit
in front of the tv

11:06.033 --> 11:07.766
With no pants
on Friday night.

11:07.768 --> 11:08.733
Seems like that's
most nights.

11:08.735 --> 11:10.902
Look, lainey and I need
this friendship to work.

11:10.904 --> 11:13.204
That means putting in
some actual effort.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.039
But not too much effort.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.241
You don't want to seem like
you're trying too hard.

11:16.243 --> 11:18.276
Here, let me fix this.
Stop it, you moron.

11:18.278 --> 11:21.579
I'm having cheesesteaks
with another middle-aged man.

11:21.581 --> 11:23.882
He doesn't care
what I look like.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.216
Of course not.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.051
Although my dad does have

11:26.053 --> 11:28.987
Some surprisingly strong
opinions about loafers.

11:28.989 --> 11:29.554
He's not a fan.

11:29.556 --> 11:31.723
Would you consider
changing to a lace-up?

11:31.725 --> 11:32.757
No!
Where'd you get my shoes?

11:32.759 --> 11:33.992
Do you even have
an icebreaker?

11:33.994 --> 11:37.829
Anecdote,
topic of conversation,
funny joke?

11:37.831 --> 11:40.131
You guys are nuts.

11:40.866 --> 11:43.301
(groans)
get out of my head!

11:43.303 --> 11:44.736
Adult adam:
<i> And so began the first</i>

11:44.738 --> 11:46.905
<i> And only bromance</i>
<i> of murray goldberg's life.</i>

11:46.907 --> 11:50.375
<i> For the next two weeks,</i>
<i> their adventures would</i>
<i> become the stuff of legend.</i>

11:50.377 --> 11:53.144
<i> ¶ everybody have fun tonight</i>
<i> bill and murray were</i>
<i> a dynamic duo</i>

11:53.146 --> 11:55.447
<i> That shared</i>
<i> so much in common...</i>

11:55.449 --> 11:58.583
<i> ¶ everybody have fun tonight</i>
<i> like tv... And sitting.</i>

11:58.585 --> 12:02.020
<i> ¶ everybody wang chung tonight</i>
<i> and food and more food</i>

12:02.022 --> 12:03.154
<i> And bathroom breaks...</i>

12:03.156 --> 12:05.190
<i> ¶ everybody have fun tonight</i>
<i> and napping...</i>

12:05.192 --> 12:06.091
<i> And sitting and sweating...</i>

12:06.093 --> 12:09.194
<i> ¶ everybody wang chung tonight</i>
could you turn
the air-conditioning on?

12:09.196 --> 12:11.563
Right over there.
(grunts)

12:11.565 --> 12:13.231
<i> And tv...</i>
(both laugh)

12:13.233 --> 12:16.735
<i> And more tv.</i>
You think I could pull off
a magnum mustache?

12:16.737 --> 12:19.838
You throw away your razor
and buy a hawaiian shirt,

12:19.840 --> 12:22.674
Because you are magnum.
(chuckles)

12:22.676 --> 12:24.642
<i> ¶ everyone ¶</i>
a sony watchman.

12:24.644 --> 12:26.411
Bill,
you shouldn't have.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.214
Well, I saw it,
and a tv
reminded me of you.

12:29.216 --> 12:31.416
One and a half inch screen,
glorious black-and-white,

12:31.418 --> 12:33.885
And you can take this
thing anywhere and no
one will even notice.

12:33.887 --> 12:36.921
This is perfect for
my on-the-go lifestyle.
(chuckles)

12:36.923 --> 12:40.291
Adult adam:
<i> Yup, my dad was discovering</i>
<i> the highs of true friendship.</i>

12:40.293 --> 12:43.561
<i> Unfortunately, he was</i>
<i> about to discover the lows.</i>

12:43.563 --> 12:45.330
Well, it's late.
I guess I should go.

12:45.332 --> 12:47.332
You sure you don't want
to watch me watch?

12:47.334 --> 12:47.966
Nah, I can't.

12:47.968 --> 12:51.402
To be honest,
I should probably
be by myself.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.171
Tough night
for me and all.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.105
Okay.

12:54.107 --> 12:57.242
'cause seven years ago today
my wife left me

12:57.244 --> 12:59.244
To raise lainey
on my own.

12:59.246 --> 12:59.644
O-okay.

12:59.646 --> 13:01.846
Kind of
rocked my world.
O-okay.

13:01.848 --> 13:03.815
I guess talking it out
would be helpful.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.784
Or taking
a nice walk alone.

13:05.786 --> 13:06.785
(exhales deeply)

13:06.787 --> 13:09.788
<i> And with that,</i>
<i> bill lewis opened up his heart</i>

13:09.790 --> 13:10.588
<i> To my closed-off dad.</i>

13:10.590 --> 13:11.923
(sobbing)
I wish I had
some batteries.

13:11.925 --> 13:14.993
<i> Meanwhile, I was downstairs</i>
<i> kicking off my career</i>

13:14.995 --> 13:17.195
<i> As a visionary</i>
<i> music video director.</i>

13:17.197 --> 13:19.564
Whoa.
What's with the stool, honey?

13:19.566 --> 13:21.099
Don't call me "honey."
it's weird.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.433
And what's
all this crap?

13:22.435 --> 13:25.170
Okay, I watched
seven straight hours of mtv,

13:25.172 --> 13:26.805
And I cracked
their formula.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.840
A music video is
one part thumping bass,

13:28.842 --> 13:32.944
One part big hair,
and one part
animated dancing cat.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.779
Go away.
Trust your director.

13:34.781 --> 13:37.549
Ditch the stool
and sit on this taxidermy ram.

13:37.551 --> 13:40.552
And my mom said
I was creepy for owning this.

13:40.554 --> 13:42.821
Um,
why is dave kim here?

13:42.823 --> 13:44.989
We needed a crew,
and he said
he would work for free

13:44.991 --> 13:46.457
If he could stand
close to you.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.893
Classic love story.
Pop star falls for roadie.

13:48.895 --> 13:51.196
That's never happened
in the history of music.

13:51.198 --> 13:54.933
Oh, it will.
In fact, it's already begun.

13:54.935 --> 13:55.333
Action.

13:55.335 --> 13:59.070
(wind whooshing)
<i> ¶ you with the sad eyes</i>

13:59.072 --> 14:00.538
<i> ¶ don't be discouraged</i>

14:00.540 --> 14:02.307
Adult adam:
<i> As director, it was my job</i>

14:02.309 --> 14:04.876
<i> To amp up my sister's</i>
<i> tender love ballad.</i>

14:04.878 --> 14:07.011
<i> First, the wind machine...</i>

14:07.013 --> 14:07.545
(exclaims) why?

14:07.547 --> 14:09.581
<i> Next,</i>
<i> a rock 'n' roll reptile...</i>

14:09.583 --> 14:10.248
<i> ¶ so small... ¶</i>

14:10.250 --> 14:12.450
<i> Followed by a thick,</i>
<i> haunting fog.</i>

14:12.452 --> 14:14.385
(coughs)
can anyone hear me?

14:14.387 --> 14:15.520
<i> And since</i>
<i> all my mom cared about</i>

14:15.522 --> 14:17.589
<i> Was getting erica</i>
<i> into juilliard,</i>

14:17.591 --> 14:19.157
<i> She paid for a blue screen.</i>

14:19.159 --> 14:21.226
Stop it.
Mom, what are you doing?

14:21.228 --> 14:24.495
It's a dancing cat
like in the paula abdul video.

14:24.497 --> 14:27.031
<i> My mom even hired</i>
<i> a band of sexy,</i>

14:27.033 --> 14:29.234
<i> Stone-faced,</i>
<i> robert palmer dancers</i>

14:29.236 --> 14:30.935
<i> From the jenkintown</i>
<i> funk academy.</i>

14:30.937 --> 14:34.239
<i> Yep, I drew from every</i>
<i> badass music video before me,</i>

14:34.241 --> 14:36.407
<i> From a-ha to zz top,</i>

14:36.409 --> 14:37.508
<i> And it was genius.</i>

14:37.510 --> 14:40.612
(sobbing)
<i> meanwhile, my dad was looking</i>
<i> for a clever way</i>

14:40.614 --> 14:41.980
<i> To bail on his friend.</i>

14:41.982 --> 14:43.348
Hey, guys.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.717
(sobbing)
(whispers)
help me.

14:45.719 --> 14:46.417
I should go.

14:46.419 --> 14:47.785
(groans)
(clears throat)

14:47.787 --> 14:49.654
No, I should.
Uh...

14:49.656 --> 14:50.822
(bill breathing heavily)

14:50.824 --> 14:52.957
Murray: Okay,
let's go out
the back door.

14:52.959 --> 14:54.726
Come on.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.161
(groans)
thanks for this, mur.

14:57.163 --> 14:59.697
It's nice to have
a friendly ear to count on.

14:59.699 --> 15:01.499
(sniffles)
see you soon?

15:01.501 --> 15:02.500
Yeah,
we'll be in touch.

15:02.502 --> 15:03.735
Drive safe, pal.
(door closes)

15:03.737 --> 15:07.605
And that concludes
my brief foray
into friendship.

15:07.607 --> 15:08.773
Wait, what?
No!

15:08.775 --> 15:11.009
He cried on my shirt...
On my shirt!

15:11.011 --> 15:12.944
Deli guy never cries
on my shirt.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.112
Deli guy isn't
your friend!

15:14.114 --> 15:16.180
I'm sorry,
but bill's got to go.

15:16.182 --> 15:17.382
Don't you
dare hurt him.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.284
He's a wonderful person
and the gatekeeper

15:19.286 --> 15:22.520
To the only hot girl
I ever tricked
into liking me.

15:22.522 --> 15:23.888
It's over, barry.
Move on.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.290
Okay, I don't want
to get real right now,

15:25.292 --> 15:26.624
But if you blow
this friendship,

15:26.626 --> 15:28.459
I'm gonna be
extremely angry.

15:28.461 --> 15:29.127
You're always angry.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.763
Damn it! It's so true
and even more angering!
(sighs)

15:31.765 --> 15:34.499
Adult adam: <i> For the next week,</i>
<i> my dad avoided bill lewis</i>

15:34.501 --> 15:36.067
<i> As my mom</i>
<i> desperately waited</i>

15:36.069 --> 15:37.368
<i> For me to finish</i>
<i> my masterpiece.</i>

15:37.370 --> 15:40.004
(groans)
I'm trying to work here.

15:40.006 --> 15:41.906
The deadline for juilliard
is this week.

15:41.908 --> 15:44.776
Just show us
what you've got.
(sighs)

15:44.778 --> 15:50.548
<i> ¶ so don't be afraid</i>
<i> to let them show</i>

15:50.649 --> 15:53.084
<i> ¶ your true colors ¶</i>

15:53.086 --> 15:54.419
<i> Stop it!</i>
<i> Stop it. Stop.</i>

15:54.421 --> 15:55.954
This part's
definitely not right.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.289
Adult adam: <i> I said,</i>
<i> knowing what was to come.</i>

15:58.291 --> 16:00.224
<i> My intention was for erica</i>
<i> to be beckoned</i>

16:00.226 --> 16:04.128
<i> Into a magical cartoon world</i>
<i> like in the a-ha video,</i>

16:04.130 --> 16:05.096
<i> But it ended up looking</i>
<i> like this.</i>

16:05.098 --> 16:08.700
Erica:
<i> ¶ ...Inside you</i>
<i> can make you feel so small</i>

16:08.702 --> 16:11.469
<i> ¶ and I see your</i>
<i> true colors ¶</i>

16:11.471 --> 16:13.671
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no.
(player stops)

16:13.673 --> 16:14.205
My god!

16:14.207 --> 16:18.242
Here's the thing.
I may have bitten off
more than I could chew.

16:18.244 --> 16:21.913
It turns out animation
is really hard

16:21.915 --> 16:24.349
And it requires
hundreds of people.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.584
This is terrible!
I can't send this in.

16:26.586 --> 16:29.487
Look, we all agree
this video isn't it.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.623
Not it? Are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

16:32.625 --> 16:34.659
There's robots punching
dragons,

16:34.661 --> 16:38.162
And I'm a droopy-eyed
stick figure riding a unicorn!

16:38.164 --> 16:39.397
Gag me with a spoon!

16:39.399 --> 16:40.498
See, I knew you still used
that phrase.

16:40.500 --> 16:44.535
You know, I could
probably cover
a lot of this with smoke.

16:44.537 --> 16:45.269
A lot of (bleep) smoke.

16:45.271 --> 16:47.739
Just forget it.
I'm not an idiot.

16:47.741 --> 16:48.606
I know I'm not the best,

16:48.608 --> 16:51.409
And I probably have
no chance
of getting into juilliard.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.011
Adult adam:
<i> And at that moment,</i>

16:53.013 --> 16:54.779
<i> My mom knew</i>
<i> erica was right.</i>

16:54.781 --> 16:56.714
I'm sorry, mom,
but it's over.

16:56.716 --> 17:00.151
<i> Turns out, my mom's dream</i>
<i> of keeping erica close to home</i>

17:00.153 --> 17:03.121
<i> Was only pushing them apart.</i>

17:03.422 --> 17:05.757
<i> Ever since</i>
<i> bill's emotional outburst,</i>

17:05.759 --> 17:07.025
<i> My dad had been</i>
<i> avoiding him.</i>

17:07.027 --> 17:10.194
<i> Only problem,</i>
<i> he couldn't hide forever.</i>

17:10.196 --> 17:11.996
(bell dings)

17:11.998 --> 17:13.331
Ooh. Hide me.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.866
Huh?

17:15.467 --> 17:16.167
Hey, mur.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.703
There you are,
standing behind
that other guy.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.238
It's me, bill lewis.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.506
Oh, hey, bill.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.841
What are you doing here,
where I work?

17:23.843 --> 17:24.842
Hadn't heard from you
in a week.

17:24.844 --> 17:26.711
Thought I'd drop on by,
see if you're okay.

17:26.713 --> 17:30.081
Yeah, well, uh,
we've just been
crazy-busy here at work.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.250
(chuckles) yeah.

17:33.318 --> 17:36.854
Anyway, hey,
you want to hit tgi fridays?

17:36.856 --> 17:39.023
It's like every day is Friday
at that place.

17:39.025 --> 17:40.758
Actually, I got
lunch plans with vic.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.560
Who's vic?
I'm vic.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.227
You and vic buddies?

17:43.229 --> 17:44.829
I never heard you
mention him before.

17:44.831 --> 17:47.965
Yeah, we don't hang out much.
He's just an employee.

17:47.967 --> 17:48.666
Was I just an employee

17:48.668 --> 17:50.334
When we went
clamming together
that one time?

17:50.336 --> 17:53.638
You went clamming
with this man,
and you didn't invite me?

17:53.640 --> 17:54.439
I didn't
even know you then.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.840
It was nothing.
Oh, is that right?

17:55.842 --> 17:57.108
What's the problem here,
mur-man?

17:57.110 --> 17:59.143
You know what
the real problem is?

17:59.145 --> 18:00.678
You and your
man tears.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.814
Murray's got walls.
How about you, vic?

18:02.816 --> 18:05.149
You want to hit up
tgi fridays with me?

18:05.151 --> 18:07.852
No, man.
I don't know you.

18:07.854 --> 18:10.888
Well, this is
a fine how-do-you-do.

18:11.023 --> 18:13.024
I'll see you never.

18:13.026 --> 18:14.926
Walls, murray.
You got walls.

18:14.928 --> 18:17.929
Adult adam:
<i> As my dad watched his only</i>
<i> friend walk out of his life,</i>

18:17.931 --> 18:23.034
<i> My mom was finally</i>
<i> ready to set erica off</i>
<i> on her own path.</i>

18:23.036 --> 18:24.402
Hey, schmoopie-boops.

18:24.404 --> 18:28.372
Stop it. I told you
no more music mtv videos.

18:28.374 --> 18:28.773
Agreed.

18:28.775 --> 18:32.210
This is the way you
should have done it
all along, your way.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.578
W-what's the point?

18:33.580 --> 18:35.213
The point is to try.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.280
Look, don't give up

18:36.282 --> 18:38.349
Just because I pushed you
in the wrong direction.

18:38.351 --> 18:41.352
<i> My mom finally accepted</i>
<i> that she couldn't control</i>

18:41.354 --> 18:43.754
<i> Where her little girl</i>
<i> would get into college.</i>

18:43.756 --> 18:45.990
Take this guitar...

18:45.992 --> 18:47.158
And do what you do best.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.060
<i> But as long as erica</i>
<i> stayed true to herself,</i>

18:49.062 --> 18:51.996
<i> She'd always find</i>
<i> her way back home.</i>

18:51.998 --> 18:55.733
<i> ¶ you with the sad eyes</i>

18:55.735 --> 18:58.069
<i> ¶ don't be discouraged</i>

18:58.071 --> 19:00.471
<i> ¶ oh, I realize</i>

19:00.473 --> 19:03.641
<i> ¶ it's hard to take courage</i>

19:03.643 --> 19:07.245
<i> ¶ in a world full of people</i>

19:07.247 --> 19:09.147
Miss him, don't you?
No.

19:09.149 --> 19:12.150
Then why are you watching
the teeny tv he gave you

19:12.152 --> 19:13.184
When there's a big one
right there?

19:13.186 --> 19:17.054
Maybe it was kind of nice
to have somebody
to hang out with...

19:17.056 --> 19:18.422
Even though he cried.

19:18.424 --> 19:20.158
Murray, that's
what friendship is.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.426
You got to be there
in the good times
and in the bad.

19:22.428 --> 19:26.097
I guess I'm just not
cut out for
that kind of thing.

19:26.099 --> 19:27.465
No, you are.

19:27.467 --> 19:31.402
'cause of all the friends
I ever made in my life...

19:31.404 --> 19:32.970
<i> ¶ your true colors</i>

19:32.972 --> 19:34.906
<i> ¶ true colors</i>
you're my favorite.

19:34.908 --> 19:38.843
<i> Turns out, bill wasn't</i>
<i> my father's first friend.</i>

19:38.845 --> 19:39.477
<i> It was pops.</i>

19:39.479 --> 19:42.113
<i> And it made my dad realize</i>
<i> that opening yourself up</i>

19:42.115 --> 19:44.415
<i> Isn't as hard</i>
<i> as he thought.</i>

19:44.417 --> 19:45.950
Hey.

19:46.251 --> 19:47.752
Oh, it's you.

19:47.754 --> 19:48.286
Should I leave?

19:48.288 --> 19:50.888
'cause you never know
when I might express
my feelings.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.657
You know,
like a human being.

19:52.659 --> 19:53.558
If you're sad,

19:53.560 --> 19:57.361
You can talk to me
about your ex-wife and all.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.197
I'm actually
feeling better today.

19:59.199 --> 20:00.932
Thank god.

20:00.934 --> 20:01.432
(chuckles)

20:01.434 --> 20:03.734
<i> ¶ don't be unhappy</i>
hey, bill murray.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.236
<i> ¶ can't remember</i>
<i> it's funny how life works out.</i>

20:05.238 --> 20:08.339
<i> You find that your worst enemy</i>
<i> can become your greatest ally.</i>

20:08.341 --> 20:09.640
<i> And the greatest</i>
<i> guidance counselors</i>

20:09.642 --> 20:11.842
<i> Aren't the ones you're given</i>
<i> in school.</i>

20:11.844 --> 20:14.879
<i> They're the people</i>
<i> who love you most.</i>

20:14.881 --> 20:16.881
<i> ¶ just call me up</i>
well, here goes nothing.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.683
<i> ¶ because you know</i>
<i> I'll be there</i>
no matter what happens...

20:18.685 --> 20:22.620
<i> ¶ I see your true colors</i>
you'll always be the best
of the best to me.

20:22.622 --> 20:23.754
<i> ¶ shining through</i>

20:23.756 --> 20:27.425
<i> 'cause in the end,</i>
<i> when you've got family</i>
<i> to help guide you</i>

20:27.427 --> 20:28.326
<i> And good friends</i>
<i> to lean on...</i>

20:28.328 --> 20:30.561
<i> ¶ and that's why I love you ¶</i>
<i> nothing in life is</i>
<i> impossible.</i>

20:30.563 --> 20:34.065
(mimicking dr. Peter venkman)
"and the flowers
are still standing."

20:34.067 --> 20:37.568
(laughs) "I'm bill murray.
'meatballs' and 'scrooged'."

20:37.570 --> 20:39.837
(in normal voice)
you know, that's not really
an impression.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.305
Funny movies, though.
(both laugh)

20:41.307 --> 20:44.242
Bill: They're very funny.
Murray: Funny movies.

20:46.411 --> 20:47.912
(inaudible)

20:47.914 --> 20:50.014
(bell dings)

20:53.552 --> 20:55.086
I know you still got
a couple of years here,

20:55.088 --> 20:56.187
But we like
to check in early

20:56.189 --> 20:58.155
To see where
you're thinking
of going to college.

20:58.157 --> 21:00.057
Where did you
go to school?
Princeton.

21:00.059 --> 21:01.559
Okay. Let's cross that
off the list.

21:01.561 --> 21:05.029
Princeton happens to be
a very prestigious university.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.298
But you're here.

21:07.499 --> 21:08.332
So...
Hey...

21:08.334 --> 21:10.434
I have a lot
of side projects.

21:10.436 --> 21:11.769
Like what?
I sculpt.

21:11.771 --> 21:14.138
I'm working on
a heart-smart cookbook.

21:14.140 --> 21:14.739
And I have my bird.

21:14.741 --> 21:17.742
Yeah, maybe there's
someone else I can talk to.

21:17.744 --> 21:20.511
That'd probably be best.

21:21.613 --> 21:25.416
Hang in there, andre.
Hang in there.
