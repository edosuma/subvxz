00:14.348 --> 00:17.976
<i>Pictures of New Orleans show
the city battered and buffered today.</i>

00:18.060 --> 00:22.022
No question, Hurricane Katrina has
given New Orleans a terrible thrashing,

00:22.105 --> 00:23.106
but that said--

00:23.190 --> 00:26.568
<i>Katrina did jog slightly east
just before hitting land,</i>

00:26.652 --> 00:28.153
<i>and that spared New Orleans.</i>

00:28.237 --> 00:32.616
<i>This was not the apocalyptic
hurricane that so many had feared.</i>

00:35.410 --> 00:38.455
What was the mood after that first day?

00:38.539 --> 00:42.501
The mood? Well, the mood was great.

00:42.584 --> 00:45.295
<i>Most of the hurricane,
worst of the hurricane missed the city,</i>

00:45.379 --> 00:48.465
<i>and we were alive.</i>

00:48.549 --> 00:51.718
<i>You can't imagine what it was like
to have been in the hospital.</i>

00:51.802 --> 00:55.222
Middle of the night,
windows shattering, power goes out.

00:57.140 --> 01:00.143
<i>Then the next day,
generators had kicked in,</i>

01:00.227 --> 01:01.895
<i>and the sky had cleared up.</i>

01:01.979 --> 01:03.105
<i>Sun was out.</i>

01:03.188 --> 01:04.313
Everybody was--

01:05.941 --> 01:10.696
<i>They were happy and relieved and thankful.</i>

01:12.364 --> 01:14.324
Maybe a little embarrassed.

01:14.408 --> 01:18.537
- Embarrassed because?
- Well, a lot of people had overreacted.

01:19.454 --> 01:21.081
Some of us had bought into the story

01:21.164 --> 01:25.043
that Katrina was gonna be
a once-in-a-century disaster,

01:25.127 --> 01:26.837
and it wasn't.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.256
The hurricane wasn't.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.552
How was Dr. Pou the second day?

01:34.636 --> 01:36.388
Dr. Pou was fine.

01:37.055 --> 01:39.892
Did the two of you have any conversations

01:39.975 --> 01:43.395
about how people were,
as you said, overreacting--

01:43.478 --> 01:46.106
- I know what you're getting at.
- No. I'm just trying to understand.

01:46.190 --> 01:48.233
If people were overreacting,

01:48.317 --> 01:50.569
what conversations
you might have had with Dr. Pou

01:50.652 --> 01:53.488
concerning what was happening
in the hospital?

01:53.572 --> 01:56.575
Did you have conversations with Dr. Pou?

02:02.122 --> 02:04.249
I will tell you this.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.543
On that second day
when things had settled,

02:06.627 --> 02:09.045
Dr. Pou could've left the hospital.

02:09.128 --> 02:12.966
She stayed because she wanted to stay.
She wanted to be there for her patients.

02:15.719 --> 02:19.723
As far as her mindset,
as far as our mindset,

02:21.308 --> 02:25.521
after we survived the hurricane,
we thought that we could survive anything.

02:27.356 --> 02:28.524
And we were wrong.

02:29.942 --> 02:31.151
<i>Lord, were we wrong.</i>

02:58.428 --> 03:02.516
<i>Wade in the water</i>

03:05.310 --> 03:10.065
<i>Wade in the water, children</i>

03:11.149 --> 03:15.946
<i>Wade in the water</i>

03:16.029 --> 03:21.243
<i>Wade in the water, children</i>

03:21.326 --> 03:25.914
<i>Wade in the water</i>

03:25.998 --> 03:31.295
<i>God is gonna trouble these waters</i>

03:31.378 --> 03:35.382
<i>Man went down to the river</i>

03:36.341 --> 03:41.263
<i>Man went down to the river, Lord</i>

03:41.346 --> 03:45.517
<i>Man went down to the river</i>

03:46.351 --> 03:50.022
<i>Went down there for to pray</i>

03:51.648 --> 03:55.485
<i>Wade in the water</i>

03:56.737 --> 04:01.575
<i>Wade in the water, children</i>

04:01.658 --> 04:05.537
<i>Wade in the water</i>

04:06.246 --> 04:11.251
<i>God is gonna trouble these waters</i>

04:16.380 --> 04:22.387
<i>God's gonna trouble these waters</i>

04:37.361 --> 04:38.820
<i>There was flooding in the basement,</i>

04:38.904 --> 04:40.697
<i>but the water's getting pumped out.</i>

04:42.866 --> 04:48.247
<i>And, we had some windows blown in,
but just be mindful of broken glass.</i>

04:48.330 --> 04:51.083
But other than that, the building held up.

04:51.166 --> 04:54.586
And y'all did amazing, every one of you.

04:54.670 --> 04:56.463
- Thank you.
- Well done.

04:58.131 --> 05:01.468
Susan? The water outside?

05:01.552 --> 05:03.887
It's gone down to around the 18-inch mark.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.348
So, should start receding pretty quick.

05:06.431 --> 05:09.393
Also, we're still having problems
with some of our landlines,

05:09.476 --> 05:11.019
but that's an issue with utilities.

05:11.103 --> 05:14.398
So, until the phone company can start
making repairs--

05:14.481 --> 05:16.024
What about the air-conditioning?

05:16.108 --> 05:17.192
That's not us.

05:17.276 --> 05:20.279
The AC runs off the city power
and the city power is out.

05:20.362 --> 05:22.447
We're running off
our backup generators right now,

05:22.531 --> 05:25.367
but should hold us
till the city power's back up.

05:25.450 --> 05:28.954
I know it is hot,
and it's only gonna get hotter.

05:29.037 --> 05:32.124
So make sure
you're drinking plenty of water.

05:32.207 --> 05:35.085
Same with patients,
family, folks sheltering.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.963
Keep everybody hydrated. Okay?

05:38.046 --> 05:39.047
Yes.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.884
All right. That's it.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.343
Thank you again.

05:43.427 --> 05:44.636
Thank you.

05:49.725 --> 05:52.144
I know some of y'all live
right around here,

05:52.227 --> 05:54.313
so if you leave to go check in at home,

05:54.396 --> 05:58.025
just make sure that you let admitting know
where you're going.

05:58.108 --> 06:00.235
Get your rounds done first, okay?

06:03.780 --> 06:05.157
Jesus. Don't close the door.

06:05.782 --> 06:06.783
Just for a minute.

06:07.618 --> 06:08.744
Very nice pep talk.

06:09.536 --> 06:12.456
Well, I meant it.
They made it through the hurricane.

06:12.539 --> 06:15.042
They didn't lose a single patient.
They should be proud.

06:15.959 --> 06:17.794
Now that it's over,

06:17.878 --> 06:21.215
has anyone talked about
lowering the head count in the building?

06:21.298 --> 06:24.510
People who are sheltering,
patients who don't need medical care?

06:25.761 --> 06:30.224
Well, if city power is still out,
not everybody's gonna wanna leave.

06:30.307 --> 06:31.767
They may not have anywhere to go.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.394
Just because we didn't take
a lot of damage, doesn't mean there's--

06:34.478 --> 06:36.688
Until we get a better sense
of what's going on outside,

06:36.772 --> 06:42.027
let's perhaps just keep the concept of
mandatory discharge out of public use.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.196
People are anxious as it is.

06:44.821 --> 06:45.948
Okay.

06:50.536 --> 06:51.745
Now can we open the door?

06:53.789 --> 06:55.749
<i>Much of the population of New Orleans</i>

06:55.832 --> 06:58.961
<i>had been evacuated to higher ground
long before the storm hit.</i>

06:59.044 --> 07:03.257
<i>That's because so much of the city,
the Big Easy, is so easily flooded.</i>

07:03.340 --> 07:04.758
<i>It's so exposed.</i>

07:04.842 --> 07:06.510
<i>Add to that monster winds,</i>

07:06.593 --> 07:09.304
<i>and you've got the makings
for widespread damage.</i>

07:11.974 --> 07:13.225
What are you doing?

07:15.227 --> 07:18.605
I heard a little rumor.

07:21.066 --> 07:24.027
An ex of mine, an anesthetist,
started working here.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.530
Just my luck he sees me looking a mess.

07:26.613 --> 07:29.575
Well, there was a hurricane.
I'm sure he's not looking real good.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.910
I'm not concerned about how he looks.

07:31.994 --> 07:34.663
I'm concerned about how I look.
And I will not look a mess.

07:39.209 --> 07:42.713
Believe that? Putting on makeup
'cause you got an ex working here.

07:43.547 --> 07:45.340
I don't know why she's bothering.

07:45.924 --> 07:49.344
If it's the guy that I'm thinking of,
she does not pick men by their looks.

07:49.428 --> 07:51.805
Yeah? I'd love to see
what her husband looks like.

07:52.264 --> 07:54.600
After last night, I could use a laugh.

08:13.452 --> 08:16.622
<i>This is Carrie's cell.
I'll call you back as soon as I can.</i>

08:18.248 --> 08:21.251
Emmett. How you doing this morning?

08:23.128 --> 08:24.630
I'm feeling all right.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.674
Are you sure?

08:27.758 --> 08:32.095
Yeah. Just been trying to call my wife.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.472
Can't get hold of her.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.975
Yeah, well, things are
still settling down out there.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.393
So until we know what's wha--

08:38.477 --> 08:42.648
You are gonna be taking us back
to the hospital over at Chalmette, right?

08:43.690 --> 08:46.902
Yeah. Just as soon as we can.

08:46.985 --> 08:49.905
I don't want my wife losing me
in all the confusion.

08:51.949 --> 08:55.494
Emmett, I am not trying
to have your wife furious at me.

08:57.287 --> 09:00.666
I'ma call Carrie personally
and let her know the minute we leave here.

09:01.708 --> 09:02.709
Thank you.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.046
You be good.

09:14.638 --> 09:15.889
<i>How you doing, man?</i>

09:15.973 --> 09:17.432
<i>I had to leave out of my house, man.</i>

09:17.516 --> 09:20.727
<i>I don't know whether that water's
coming over that levee or what?</i>

09:20.811 --> 09:22.563
<i>I don't-- The last I heard, it's not.</i>

09:23.063 --> 09:25.065
<i>Last-- The storm missed us.</i>

09:25.148 --> 09:27.651
-<i>I can't hear you.</i>
-<i>The storm went east.</i>

09:28.652 --> 09:30.112
<i>So you haven't heard about</i>

09:30.195 --> 09:31.738
<i>that water coming over that levee
from the lake?</i>

09:31.822 --> 09:33.407
<i>No. I'll check it out.</i>

09:33.490 --> 09:36.201
<i>'Cause the water started
rising so high at my two-story apartment,</i>

09:36.285 --> 09:37.286
<i>I had to get out, man.</i>

09:37.369 --> 09:39.663
-<i>Where's that at?</i>
-<i>Right over…</i>

09:42.499 --> 09:46.211
Watch the floor. Water's still coming in.

09:47.462 --> 09:49.214
They sending anybody up here?

09:49.298 --> 09:50.674
Is who sending anybody?

09:51.675 --> 09:54.386
Memorial. Take care of the water
and all of that?

09:54.469 --> 09:56.346
I don't know how y'all got it worked
back at Chalmette,

09:56.430 --> 09:59.516
but over here,
one building, two hospitals.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.560
LifeCare, we're just on our own.

10:01.643 --> 10:05.189
Hell, nobody even came up
from Memorial to check on us last night.

10:08.025 --> 10:09.484
That's dirty.

10:09.568 --> 10:11.653
If you ever wanna transfer
up to Chalmette, let me know.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.281
Keep me posted
on when you're transferring back.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.074
Y'all been sweet to us,
and I appreciate it.

10:17.034 --> 10:19.119
Next hurricane, I'm taking the day off.

10:19.203 --> 10:20.120
Right?

10:20.621 --> 10:22.247
<i>What are we looking at?</i>

10:23.457 --> 10:24.458
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

10:24.541 --> 10:28.128
<i>…reports of looting.
One person in the Westbank called</i>

10:28.212 --> 10:32.716
<i>and said, people were just running in
and taking what they wanted, and ran out.</i>

10:32.799 --> 10:35.427
<i>Anybody who's had a chance
to walk around and look at anything,</i>

10:35.511 --> 10:38.555
<i>if y'all came downtown to the CBD
and had a look--</i>

10:38.639 --> 10:40.140
<i>I mean, this place looks like Beirut.</i>

10:40.224 --> 10:42.684
<i>It looks like Beirut
that was soaked with water.</i>

10:42.768 --> 10:45.103
<i>So, a military presence,</i>

10:45.187 --> 10:47.814
<i>people walking around in full combat gear,</i>

10:47.898 --> 10:49.816
<i>with loaded rifles,</i>

10:49.900 --> 10:52.361
<i>is about the only thing
that's out of-- that's not in the picture.</i>

10:52.444 --> 10:53.779
<i>And it's about to be in the picture.</i>

10:59.493 --> 11:00.661
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

11:04.915 --> 11:08.252
How does that feel? Good?
I'm gonna give you some more, okay?

11:08.877 --> 11:10.003
Here we go.

11:10.838 --> 11:13.173
Yeah.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.927
Angela, y'all doing okay?

11:17.886 --> 11:21.056
We're all right. They gonna do something
about the air-conditioning?

11:22.182 --> 11:23.392
City power's out.

11:24.852 --> 11:29.273
I know your mom's uncomfortable,
but she's a fighter.

11:30.065 --> 11:31.149
Yeah.

11:32.025 --> 11:35.737
Keep giving her water.
And you can use a compress if you have to.

11:35.821 --> 11:36.864
I have been.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.908
They should have the air on pretty soon.

11:39.992 --> 11:40.993
Okay.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.539
- Thanks, Diane.
- Yeah.

11:52.129 --> 11:55.215
I just wanna make sure
everything's all right.

11:55.299 --> 11:56.300
Everything's fine.

11:56.383 --> 12:00.262
Somebody mentioned to me
that they saw you carrying a gun.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.514
- I am carrying a gun.
- And it made them uncomfortable.

12:02.598 --> 12:05.559
I have a license to carry a gun.
I have a right to carry a gun.

12:05.642 --> 12:09.104
You have every right in the world
to protect yourself.

12:09.188 --> 12:12.024
But this is still a working hospital.

12:12.107 --> 12:16.695
And I would just ask you to be mindful
of the example you're setting.

12:18.614 --> 12:19.740
Sure. Yeah.

12:20.866 --> 12:22.075
Thank you, Ewing.

12:28.373 --> 12:29.291
Doctor?

12:29.374 --> 12:31.001
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

12:31.084 --> 12:33.212
Are you all making us leave?

12:33.295 --> 12:34.463
Making you what?

12:34.546 --> 12:36.757
Somebody said
you're gonna start moving out patients.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.175
Are you a patient?

12:38.258 --> 12:42.429
My dad. He had to get his leg fixed up,
but our house took some damage.

12:42.513 --> 12:44.181
I can't take him back there.

12:44.264 --> 12:47.518
No one is gonna be discharged
if they don't have somewhere to go.

12:47.601 --> 12:48.602
He's still in pain--

12:48.685 --> 12:51.980
No one is going to be forcibly discharged.

12:52.064 --> 12:53.982
Now, my name is Doctor Horace Baltz.

12:54.066 --> 12:57.945
If you have any problems,
you ask to see me. All right?

12:58.737 --> 12:59.947
- Thank you.
- All right.

13:01.990 --> 13:04.076
<i>Because the eye of Katrina veered east,</i>

13:04.159 --> 13:07.746
<i>New Orleans avoided a direct hit,
but it was still hit hard.</i>

13:08.956 --> 13:11.750
<i>Louisiana Governor
Kathleen Blanco went on television,</i>

13:11.834 --> 13:14.920
<i>warning those who fled the city
to stay away.</i>

13:15.003 --> 13:18.632
It's about economies of scale,
just like anything else.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.968
And Tenet Healthcare,
we're not just hospitals.

13:21.051 --> 13:24.888
We're surgical centers, ambulatory
surgical centers, urgent care centers--

13:24.972 --> 13:27.599
- So you can provide a suite of options?
- Exactly.

13:27.683 --> 13:29.434
We support local hospitals

13:29.518 --> 13:32.855
with corporate development resources
that assist in revenue growth,

13:32.938 --> 13:35.649
therefore market share increase
and physician relations

13:35.732 --> 13:37.359
through the entire Gulf Coast Region.

13:37.442 --> 13:40.487
Excuse me, sir. There. There you go.

13:40.571 --> 13:43.365
So I got a question.
I'm kinda serious about it.

13:44.700 --> 13:48.620
The Katrina stuff in Louisiana,
something like that good for business?

13:48.704 --> 13:53.792
Y'all got hospitals around New Orleans,
but that kinda thing good for you?

13:53.876 --> 13:55.836
- Oh, Jesus.
- No, but--

13:56.295 --> 13:57.754
But from a straight financial view?

13:57.838 --> 13:59.131
And he's still on his first beer.

13:59.840 --> 14:03.218
Look, after something like this,
you get more patient traffic, right?

14:04.720 --> 14:06.346
There's more insurance claims,
more paperwork.

14:10.726 --> 14:12.644
That's gotta cut into your margins, right?

14:18.775 --> 14:19.943
I'm not exactly sure

14:20.027 --> 14:24.114
which department is in charge of
post-disaster P&L accounting.

14:25.574 --> 14:28.285
I'm just in charge of Gulf Coast
Business Development. So…

14:29.912 --> 14:31.121
I'm just asking.

14:33.790 --> 14:34.875
Can't really say.

14:36.168 --> 14:37.711
So we were talking about scale?

14:37.794 --> 14:39.046
We were talking about scale.

14:39.129 --> 14:42.508
And Tenet Healthcare,
it is the Gulf Region.

15:08.784 --> 15:10.702
Hey. Be careful out there.

15:10.786 --> 15:13.539
Saw some kids eyeing one of the nurses
when she was out with her dog.

15:13.622 --> 15:16.959
- Seriously?
- Probably nothing, but watch yourself.

15:17.042 --> 15:18.627
Y'all be careful if you go outside.

15:18.710 --> 15:21.088
One of the nurses was
getting harassed by some kids.

15:21.171 --> 15:23.006
- Harassed?
- It's what security told me.

15:23.882 --> 15:25.217
Apparently, there was a nurse

15:25.300 --> 15:27.803
who got attacked by a bunch of kids
while she was outside.

15:28.345 --> 15:29.930
- Outside the hospital?
- Yeah.

15:30.514 --> 15:33.141
- How many kids?
- I just know she got attacked.

15:33.225 --> 15:35.644
<i>What I was told is, she was out walking,</i>

15:35.727 --> 15:37.187
<i>she got attacked, raped…</i>

15:37.271 --> 15:39.106
- What? Where did this happen?
-…by a bunch of kids.

15:39.189 --> 15:40.566
Just outside the hospital.

15:40.649 --> 15:42.484
- Who was assaulted?
- A nurse.

15:42.568 --> 15:44.027
- But who?
- I don't have a name.

15:45.487 --> 15:48.073
If a nurse was gang raped
outside the hospital,

15:48.156 --> 15:49.783
we probably would have treated her.

15:49.867 --> 15:52.786
- And I haven't heard anything about--
- Everybody's talking about it.

15:52.870 --> 15:53.871
Who is every--

15:53.954 --> 15:55.998
And if our people aren't safe
at our hospital,

15:56.081 --> 15:58.166
then we've got some serious problems.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.918
What are we gonna do about it?

16:00.919 --> 16:04.506
- She was sexually assaulted?
- By apparently a few individuals.

16:05.174 --> 16:06.884
We haven't heard anything about it.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.760
That's not coming from you then?

16:08.844 --> 16:10.679
Heard of some trouble spots
out in the parish,

16:10.762 --> 16:13.724
but a nurse being assaulted
outside of the hospital? No.

16:13.807 --> 16:16.685
- Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.
- Okay.

16:24.735 --> 16:27.529
<i>As the water continues to rise
in New Orleans,</i>

16:27.613 --> 16:30.866
<i>people are forced out of their homes,
out of their neighborhoods,</i>

16:30.949 --> 16:32.910
<i>out of the solace of their families.</i>

16:36.830 --> 16:38.415
Hey. Come on.

16:40.751 --> 16:42.419
I got this.

16:50.427 --> 16:54.264
- Look at that.
- Jesus. Starting already.

16:54.348 --> 16:55.349
No shit.

16:58.143 --> 17:00.521
You know, I heard
a couple of nurses got gang raped.

17:20.123 --> 17:21.834
I got great stuff.

17:24.962 --> 17:27.297
- What you got?
- Don't worry. You got your own shit.

17:27.381 --> 17:29.758
Hey. Where'd you get the stuff?

17:31.677 --> 17:34.054
We got it. Don't worry about it.

17:34.763 --> 17:35.889
Where did you get it?

17:37.057 --> 17:39.309
- Got it at the store.
- Store's not open.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.186
We opened it.

17:42.771 --> 17:44.648
Did your mother teach you to be a thief?

17:44.731 --> 17:46.066
We ain't no thieves.

17:46.149 --> 17:47.317
You stole it.

17:50.404 --> 17:52.197
All we did,

17:52.281 --> 17:55.367
got diapers for my little sister,
got some food for my moms.

17:56.243 --> 17:57.452
City's wrecked, man.

17:58.704 --> 18:00.247
Y'all fixing to put us out of here.

18:00.330 --> 18:01.582
Who's putting you out?

18:02.708 --> 18:05.711
I mean, that's the talk.
They putting people out.

18:07.129 --> 18:09.798
You know. They're gonna put us out first.

18:09.882 --> 18:13.260
Now where my mom supposed to get
this stuff when y'all kick us to the curb?

18:14.094 --> 18:16.722
All this is, is soul surviving.

18:17.723 --> 18:18.974
Surviving for the soul.

18:23.395 --> 18:27.858
Any damage to the structure, inside,
outside, just get photos, document it.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.193
- Susan.
- Anything that--

18:29.276 --> 18:30.652
Just one second.

18:30.736 --> 18:32.529
Anything to note
needs to go up to corporate.

18:32.613 --> 18:33.906
Yeah, I'll get on it.

18:33.989 --> 18:35.073
What can I do for you?

18:35.157 --> 18:37.701
Something about these damn rumors
floating around.

18:37.784 --> 18:41.371
I've heard. Just tell people,
as far as we know, nobody was raped.

18:41.455 --> 18:42.998
Nobody was assaulted.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.499
Wait. What?

18:45.083 --> 18:46.668
As far as we know, we can't confirm

18:46.752 --> 18:49.671
that a nurse was assaulted
outside the building.

18:49.755 --> 18:52.090
That's not what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about rumors

18:52.174 --> 18:54.009
that we're gonna start dumping people
on the streets.

18:54.092 --> 18:57.137
We are not going to dump people.

18:57.221 --> 19:00.849
But as soon as we can,
we will consider discharging patients.

19:00.933 --> 19:04.144
Discharging them to where, Susan?
Where are people supposed to go?

19:04.228 --> 19:06.980
We don't have city power.
We are running low on medicine.

19:07.064 --> 19:09.983
So it is in everyone's best interest
to consider ways

19:10.067 --> 19:12.778
- to ease the load of the hospital.
- Not everyone has somewhere to go.

19:16.073 --> 19:18.367
And when you start talking about
putting people out,

19:18.450 --> 19:21.787
a lot of folks in this community,
they'd take that how it sounds.

19:21.870 --> 19:23.121
Like you're abandoning them.

19:23.205 --> 19:26.041
Dr. King, I'm getting it from all sides.

19:26.124 --> 19:28.544
You've only been at this hospital
for a few months,

19:28.627 --> 19:31.296
so I understand that you are
still learning your way around,

19:31.380 --> 19:34.466
but I am the one who has to make
the critical decisions.

19:34.550 --> 19:37.427
If people don't have anywhere to go,
we will figure it out.

19:37.511 --> 19:40.138
Otherwise,
when the water starts going down,

19:40.222 --> 19:42.599
we have to begin discharging--

19:42.683 --> 19:44.518
discharging patients.

19:44.601 --> 19:47.646
And will you pass around, if people
don't know what they're talking about,

19:47.729 --> 19:49.857
would they please keep their mouth shut?

19:54.987 --> 19:56.196
<i>Hey, it's Vince.</i>

19:56.280 --> 19:58.824
<i>Anna and I can't come to the phone.
Leave us a message.</i>

20:01.118 --> 20:02.786
It's me. Just trying again.

20:06.874 --> 20:11.670
The air-conditioning is still not working,
but otherwise we're good.

20:14.590 --> 20:15.883
We're good.

20:18.260 --> 20:22.639
So, when you get this message,
just call, okay?

20:24.391 --> 20:25.976
My cell service has been spotty,

20:26.059 --> 20:28.103
so if I don't pick up,
just leave a message.

20:28.187 --> 20:30.689
I'll call you back. Okay.

20:33.358 --> 20:35.736
I'll talk to you when you call.
All right, bye.

20:58.759 --> 20:59.927
<i>Hey, it's Vince.</i>

21:00.010 --> 21:02.638
<i>Anna and I can't come to the phone.
Leave us a message.</i>

21:04.515 --> 21:06.350
I love you, okay?

21:07.684 --> 21:09.520
I miss you and I love you.

21:19.696 --> 21:20.697
Freddy!

21:21.615 --> 21:22.908
How's it going?

21:22.991 --> 21:24.368
Still at 18 inches.

21:25.369 --> 21:26.578
It hasn't moved at all?

21:27.371 --> 21:28.413
No.

21:29.623 --> 21:31.124
The city pump should be working.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.920
- All right. You keep an eye on it, yeah?
- Yeah.

21:35.003 --> 21:36.004
All right.

21:44.263 --> 21:47.850
<i>Everything's okay here.
Your mom's doing okay.</i>

21:48.642 --> 21:50.477
<i>It's just the heat, that's all.</i>

21:50.561 --> 21:51.812
They tell you what's going on?

21:53.564 --> 21:57.150
Well, all they're saying is that
the city's power is out,

21:57.234 --> 21:58.569
so there's no air.

21:59.111 --> 22:02.406
-<i>There's no way to keep cool?</i>
- Well, I can see if I can get a fan.

22:02.489 --> 22:06.326
But there's water
and your mom ate some. And I'm here.

22:06.410 --> 22:09.830
Did they say anything about when they'll
have the rest of the power back on?

22:09.913 --> 22:12.332
- Not yet.
<i>- Well, if they don't tell you anything,</i>

22:12.416 --> 22:14.209
you try to find somebody
and ask them, okay?

22:14.293 --> 22:15.502
-<i>Okay.</i>
- And let us know.

22:15.586 --> 22:17.921
-<i>I will. She'll be fine.</i>
- Yeah. Okay.

22:18.005 --> 22:19.798
<i>I'll call you as soon as we get an update.</i>

22:19.882 --> 22:21.508
All right. You take care then.

22:21.592 --> 22:22.885
-<i>All right.</i>
- All right. Bye.

22:33.562 --> 22:34.605
Hey.

22:35.564 --> 22:36.732
How bad is it?

22:38.108 --> 22:39.401
The dock's wrecked.

22:39.484 --> 22:42.362
There's a lot of downed trees,
but it could have been worse.

22:43.322 --> 22:44.323
How's your mom?

22:45.073 --> 22:47.034
Jill says the hospital's on generators.

22:47.618 --> 22:48.994
There's no air conditioner.

22:49.828 --> 22:51.747
And they're not telling her anything.

22:51.830 --> 22:53.415
But your mom's okay?

22:56.168 --> 22:57.544
I guess. I just…

22:59.755 --> 23:01.173
What?

23:04.384 --> 23:07.054
Your mom is all right.
She's got Jill with her.

23:08.013 --> 23:10.849
And she's safer there
than she would be here.

23:25.030 --> 23:29.618
<i>This whole area is flooded
back here and it happened after the storm.</i>

23:29.701 --> 23:30.702
<i>We sitting on the porch</i>

23:30.786 --> 23:33.163
-<i>looking at the water rising up.</i>
-<i>How deep is it?</i>

23:33.247 --> 23:36.124
<i>It's coming up on to 4 feet.
Never had no flood that deep.</i>

23:36.208 --> 23:39.795
<i>The cars is underwater completely.
Is the pumps on?</i>

23:39.878 --> 23:42.673
<i>Pumps are on, but that area is the--</i>

23:42.756 --> 23:45.342
-<i>the Marconi pump.</i>
- Mom, need something to drink?

23:45.926 --> 23:48.637
- Did you hear there's flooding?
- Flooding?

23:48.720 --> 23:50.681
There's water collecting.

23:52.015 --> 23:54.268
Well, that's what they're saying
on the radio.

23:54.351 --> 23:56.103
Oh, please, Mom.

23:56.186 --> 23:59.439
- I want to hear what's going on.
- Nobody knows what's going on.

23:59.523 --> 24:00.607
That's the problem.

24:01.525 --> 24:03.610
Nobody knows what they're talking about.

24:04.695 --> 24:06.864
The people who know the least
talk the most.

24:18.792 --> 24:19.918
Mom, don't.

24:24.339 --> 24:25.883
- Mom.
- No, it's all right.

24:25.966 --> 24:27.509
It is not all right.

24:37.603 --> 24:39.438
Everybody's spreading rumors.

24:41.773 --> 24:43.317
Afraid of things that aren't there.

24:47.571 --> 24:51.825
2,000 people in this hospital
and I have to take care of all of 'em.

24:54.411 --> 24:55.787
Every one of 'em.

24:59.458 --> 25:01.376
You did take care of them.

25:02.794 --> 25:06.924
You got 2,000 people through the storm.

25:07.716 --> 25:10.260
If you want the truth, that's the truth.

25:10.969 --> 25:12.429
You did that.

25:14.848 --> 25:16.058
You did that.

25:57.724 --> 25:59.643
- Yeah, I've got it.
- Careful.

26:20.330 --> 26:21.748
I was so worried.

26:22.708 --> 26:25.002
- You were?
- Yes. Of course.

26:26.003 --> 26:27.171
How was it here?

26:34.261 --> 26:38.473
<i>That was Aaron Neville
here on WWVV, the sound of New Orleans.</i>

26:38.557 --> 26:42.186
<i>Playing the best music
through the decades. And now Foreigner.</i>

26:44.062 --> 26:45.898
Right? This is, like, our song.

26:47.107 --> 26:49.943
- Our song?
- Yeah.

26:50.027 --> 26:52.654
- This is the cheesiest song.
- Yeah.

26:52.738 --> 26:55.157
But we heard it
on our first date, remember?

26:55.991 --> 26:57.367
It was at that pig roast.

26:57.451 --> 26:59.119
I was never at a pig roast.

26:59.203 --> 27:00.746
- You-- What?
- No.

27:00.829 --> 27:03.123
You could not take your eyes off me
at the pig roast.

27:03.207 --> 27:05.334
- I was never at a pig roast.
- Wait.

27:05.417 --> 27:06.793
You really don't remember it?

27:07.586 --> 27:10.088
I mean, that may have been a first date.

27:10.172 --> 27:11.798
I don't think it was our first date.

27:13.467 --> 27:15.385
Yeah. Well, I'm pretty sure.

27:17.596 --> 27:19.264
- No. I wasn't.
- No. Hang on. Wait.

27:19.348 --> 27:24.478
Maybe it was that other beautiful,
cinnamon-haired future otolaryngologist

27:24.561 --> 27:26.396
I had my eye on. It could be.

27:26.480 --> 27:28.065
- Maybe it was--
- Had your eye on?

27:33.111 --> 27:35.280
I should take a shower. I smell.

27:35.364 --> 27:36.657
You smell fine.

27:42.746 --> 27:44.206
You smell wonderful.

28:10.065 --> 28:12.067
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

28:13.944 --> 28:19.449
If I could run to you right now,
I would run to you.

28:23.120 --> 28:27.207
But I can't. I can't be there right now.

28:28.458 --> 28:30.544
But my love is there.

28:31.712 --> 28:35.465
My love is always right there with you.

28:37.676 --> 28:38.969
I love you too.

28:55.152 --> 28:56.361
<i>Karen?</i>

28:58.030 --> 28:59.239
<i>Karen?</i>

29:00.407 --> 29:01.700
I'm here.

29:01.783 --> 29:03.076
<i>Code blue. ER.</i>

29:31.271 --> 29:32.356
Doctor's coming.

29:32.439 --> 29:34.566
I'll go see if it's fixed.
Doctors are on their way, ma'am.

29:34.650 --> 29:36.401
Ma'am, can you hear me?

29:36.485 --> 29:37.945
They're gonna help you with that now.

29:38.028 --> 29:39.821
- Just try to stay calm.
- At least two liters.

29:39.905 --> 29:41.156
Breathe.

29:42.407 --> 29:43.450
Okay.

29:44.243 --> 29:46.453
What's your name?
Can you tell me your name?

29:46.537 --> 29:47.579
It's Joleen.

29:47.663 --> 29:49.706
- What's going on?
- She got stabbed.

29:49.790 --> 29:51.959
- Were you there? How many times?
- Yeah. Just one.

29:52.042 --> 29:55.254
Okay. Miss Joleen, your son tells me
you were stabbed--

29:55.337 --> 29:57.047
- Grandson.
- Is that right?

29:57.130 --> 29:58.507
Is it just the one wound?

29:58.590 --> 30:00.467
- Do you feel pain anywhere else?
- What do we have?

30:00.551 --> 30:02.886
Female. Late 50s. Penetrating chest wound.

30:02.970 --> 30:05.013
- Labored respirations.
- No radials. BP's crashing.

30:05.097 --> 30:06.849
- Let's get a cross and match in here.
- Is she all right?

30:06.932 --> 30:08.559
- Do we know if the blood bank's open?
- I don't know.

30:08.642 --> 30:09.935
- On it.
- All right. Hang fluids for now.

30:10.018 --> 30:12.896
- Hey! What's going on here?
- Dr. Baltz, would you mind…

30:12.980 --> 30:14.565
Yeah. Come with me, son.

30:14.648 --> 30:16.650
- I'm staying with her.
- Go with the doctor.

30:16.733 --> 30:20.779
Come. It's all right.
They know what they're doing.

30:20.863 --> 30:25.075
They're gonna take very good care of her.
Now, you come with me, all right? Come on.

30:25.158 --> 30:27.286
Initiate oxygen.
We're gonna take care of you.

30:27.369 --> 30:28.954
Okay. Right over there.

30:32.916 --> 30:35.419
Now, are you all right?

30:36.086 --> 30:37.713
Did anything happen to you?

30:39.131 --> 30:40.883
Okay. What's your name?

30:42.593 --> 30:43.635
Taylor.

30:44.553 --> 30:45.596
Taylor?

30:49.016 --> 30:51.310
I have to explain something to you.

30:54.229 --> 30:57.441
That was a violent assault.

30:58.901 --> 31:02.112
And the police are gonna
have to write up a report on that.

31:03.238 --> 31:04.448
They have to.

31:05.407 --> 31:10.412
Now, if you'd like,
I can help you. All right?

31:12.706 --> 31:13.707
Okay.

31:14.917 --> 31:16.126
What happened?

31:19.254 --> 31:22.549
Are you trying to protect the person
who did this? Hmm?

31:26.094 --> 31:27.262
Okay.

31:27.346 --> 31:29.389
Well, what happened? You can tell me.

31:30.516 --> 31:31.517
Come on.

31:36.939 --> 31:39.733
There was the whole storm
and everything, right?

31:40.817 --> 31:42.402
The shit passed and--

31:43.529 --> 31:46.198
Gram, she was all happy,
'cause she thought--

31:47.574 --> 31:50.619
We all thought it was gonna be hella bad.

31:51.370 --> 31:53.080
And-- But power's out.

31:54.206 --> 31:56.124
Nothing to do,
but make something of it, right?

31:56.208 --> 31:59.586
And so, Gran's having people over, right?

31:59.670 --> 32:02.297
And partying and shit.
And drinking and shit.

32:03.215 --> 32:04.633
Drinking too much.

32:06.134 --> 32:07.261
A fight breaks out.

32:09.721 --> 32:11.723
Next thing, they grab a kitchen knife.

32:11.807 --> 32:15.978
- Who grabbed a kitchen knife?
- Things got hectic. They stabbed her.

32:16.061 --> 32:17.855
Who stabbed her?

32:20.566 --> 32:22.025
- My mom.
- Your mom?

32:24.570 --> 32:25.654
Your mother?

32:31.243 --> 32:34.288
Your mother stabbed her mother?

32:40.711 --> 32:41.920
Are you gonna snitch?

32:43.922 --> 32:45.716
Are you gonna send my mom to jail?

32:50.387 --> 32:51.555
It's all right, son.

32:53.140 --> 32:54.349
We'll work this out.

33:00.397 --> 33:03.358
Doesn't make sense.
It just doesn't make any sense.

33:03.442 --> 33:04.443
I heard you.

33:06.320 --> 33:08.614
- Well, you didn't answer, so…
- What do you want me to say?

33:08.697 --> 33:09.907
I can't leave.

33:11.617 --> 33:14.953
The hospital is full of doctors, you know.

33:15.662 --> 33:17.956
Your boss said before the hurricane,

33:18.040 --> 33:20.042
that you could've signed out
your patients and left town.

33:20.125 --> 33:22.503
Okay, we are in the middle of
an emergency situation.

33:22.586 --> 33:25.130
- Yeah, the storm's over.
- Every individual is needed.

33:25.214 --> 33:28.967
We still have patients coming in.
We don't know what's going on in the city.

33:29.051 --> 33:30.719
- Nothing is going on.
- I heard on the news

33:30.802 --> 33:32.012
- people are rioting.
- The news is-- Come on.

33:32.095 --> 33:33.263
The news is just--

33:33.972 --> 33:37.226
People are trying to clean up.
And that's it.

33:37.309 --> 33:38.310
So you can stay.

33:39.269 --> 33:40.395
What am I gonna do here?

33:40.479 --> 33:42.731
- What are you gonna do out there?
- Check on our house.

33:42.814 --> 33:44.191
Okay, the house will be fine.

33:44.274 --> 33:47.778
It will be fine, but somebody
still needs to be there.

33:52.658 --> 33:53.700
All right, look.

33:55.494 --> 33:57.246
I'm gonna check on the house.

33:57.329 --> 33:59.915
I'm gonna pick up some food.
I'm gonna come back. All right?

34:00.791 --> 34:02.459
- Okay.
- We can have another campout.

34:03.502 --> 34:06.004
We can listen to some more
bad '80s power ballads.

34:07.756 --> 34:08.882
Sound good?

34:09.842 --> 34:11.885
- Yeah.
- All right.

34:18.934 --> 34:22.228
And speaking of hearing things,

34:23.397 --> 34:27.275
I heard that one of your ex-boyfriends
started working here.

34:29.069 --> 34:30.279
News to me.

34:34.032 --> 34:36.368
- I love you, Anna.
- I love you too.

34:37.077 --> 34:38.328
I love you.

34:51.925 --> 34:56.221
<i>…metropolitan area in
general, in the huge majority of areas…</i>

34:56.304 --> 35:01.018
<i>…it's not rising at all. It's the same.</i>

35:01.602 --> 35:05.522
<i>In some parts of New Orleans,
because of the 17th Street breach,</i>

35:05.606 --> 35:06.899
<i>it may be rising.</i>

35:06.982 --> 35:09.943
<i>And that seemed to be the case
in parts of downtown.</i>

35:10.027 --> 35:12.321
<i>But I don't want to alarm
everybody that, you know,</i>

35:12.404 --> 35:15.073
<i>New Orleans is filling up like a bowl.
That's just not happening.</i>

35:15.157 --> 35:17.284
<i>That was Louisiana senator, David Vitter.</i>

35:17.367 --> 35:18.911
Good day to not be in Louisiana.

35:19.578 --> 35:22.039
Every day is a good day
not to be in Louisiana.

35:24.750 --> 35:26.502
Something like this good for business?

35:27.252 --> 35:28.253
What?

35:28.795 --> 35:32.132
I had a client ask if something
like this was good for business.

35:33.634 --> 35:34.718
Seriously?

35:35.385 --> 35:36.386
Yeah.

35:38.764 --> 35:40.307
Course it's good for business.

35:42.559 --> 35:44.019
It's a fucked-up thing to ask.

35:44.728 --> 35:45.812
I know, right?

35:50.901 --> 35:52.110
<i>What are you seeing?</i>

35:53.070 --> 35:55.072
Tinting's been ripped off
most of the building.

35:55.155 --> 35:56.657
Got a blown-out window there

35:56.740 --> 35:57.991
- on the third floor.
- I got it.

35:58.075 --> 36:01.495
A bunch on the fifth. HVAC damaged here.

36:01.578 --> 36:04.039
Hey! Which one of you is in charge?

36:05.958 --> 36:07.668
We've got some levees breached.

36:07.751 --> 36:10.671
Get ready because we've got about
15 feet of water coming this way.

36:11.547 --> 36:13.006
Yeah, right.

36:13.090 --> 36:14.591
Hey. You hearing me?

36:15.217 --> 36:18.428
Y'all got about 15 feet of water coming.
You don't have a lot of time.

36:19.930 --> 36:21.974
Water is coming. A shitload of water.

36:22.057 --> 36:23.267
How much is a shitload?

36:23.350 --> 36:26.103
The storm surge from the hurricane
caused the 17th Street Canal levee

36:26.186 --> 36:27.688
to collapse on the Orleans side.

36:27.771 --> 36:30.107
Water's pouring into the city
from Lake Pontchartrain.

36:30.190 --> 36:31.817
- Has been since yesterday.
- Yesterday?

36:31.900 --> 36:33.735
Water's been pouring
into the city since yesterday?

36:33.819 --> 36:35.529
Where are you getting
this information from?

36:35.612 --> 36:36.613
Susan, I think we need--

36:36.697 --> 36:39.783
No. I have spent a day and a night
listening to rumors and half-truths.

36:39.867 --> 36:41.618
And now this one shows up here. It's--

36:41.702 --> 36:45.622
- How does no one know levees collapsed?
- It is a goddamn mess out there.

36:45.706 --> 36:48.208
No one is in charge.
Nobody knows what they're doing.

36:48.292 --> 36:50.502
If you're waiting for an official order,
it's not coming.

36:50.586 --> 36:52.379
- What do we do?
- Get your people outta here.

36:52.462 --> 36:54.298
Activate your evac plan. Put it to work.

36:56.091 --> 36:58.927
We don't have a plan
for evacuating during a flood.

37:01.096 --> 37:02.306
Jesus Christ.

37:03.682 --> 37:05.642
Well, we have people stationed here.

37:05.726 --> 37:09.354
We'll do what we can, but you need
to get something going.

37:10.731 --> 37:11.899
Jesus.

37:11.982 --> 37:14.151
How much water
until we're in real trouble?

37:15.110 --> 37:16.987
Four feet
puts the electrical switches under.

37:17.070 --> 37:18.780
Then we lose what's left of our power.

37:18.864 --> 37:20.908
- Food, supplies, the emergency room--
- We need to call someone.

37:20.991 --> 37:22.242
- We need to call--
- Call someone?

37:22.326 --> 37:25.120
- We need to get in touch with the city.
- Yeah, but did you hear him?

37:25.204 --> 37:26.872
Nobody in the city
knows what they're doing.

37:26.955 --> 37:28.707
If we start trying to move patients--

37:29.208 --> 37:30.792
What if he's wrong?
What if there is no water?

37:30.876 --> 37:34.630
Eric, go get some spotters outside.
I need to know when the water's coming.

37:34.713 --> 37:36.590
- How fast, how high.
- All right.

37:36.673 --> 37:39.468
I need a head count.
How many patients are left.

37:39.551 --> 37:42.304
How many staff.
Who's been discharged. Who's left.

37:42.387 --> 37:44.556
I need to know every soul
that's in this hospital.

37:49.645 --> 37:51.104
Jesus. God help me.

37:54.858 --> 37:57.277
Dr. Pou, where's your husband?

37:57.361 --> 37:59.571
Vince left. He went to check on our house.

37:59.655 --> 38:01.782
You need to go get him. Look outside.

38:04.451 --> 38:07.246
No, I mean, do you see that?
Look how fast it's coming in though.

38:19.383 --> 38:23.720
They're saying that the levees
have breached in at some location, and…

38:27.850 --> 38:28.934
<i>Hey, it's Vince.</i>

38:29.017 --> 38:31.520
<i>Anna and I can't come to the phone.
Leave us a message.</i>

38:33.397 --> 38:35.607
Vince, it's Anna.
If you're there, pick up.

38:39.236 --> 38:40.654
Vince, are you there?

38:43.365 --> 38:46.285
Vince? Vince, pick up the phone.

38:48.912 --> 38:49.913
Vince.
