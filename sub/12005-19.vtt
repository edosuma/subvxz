00:01.685 --> 00:02.318
<i>Previously on "Switched at Birth"...</i>

00:02.352 --> 00:03.452
This is Angelo Sorrento.

00:03.487 --> 00:04.470
Barbara's partner in the restaurant.

00:04.504 --> 00:06.221
Nice to meet you.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.224
Do you think you could find
out if he's seeing anyone?

00:08.258 --> 00:09.959
Sure. I'll ask.

00:09.977 --> 00:11.227
Turns out Angelo is married.

00:11.261 --> 00:13.029
He just doesn't wear a wedding ring.

00:13.141 --> 00:17.138
___

00:18.101 --> 00:19.869
I gotta be honest.

00:19.903 --> 00:21.988
I've had a couple dreams about you.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.790
He told me that his wife
is beginning to suspect.

00:24.825 --> 00:25.841
<i>Jace: He's responding.</i>

00:25.875 --> 00:27.576
- No way.
- (Phone dings)

00:29.713 --> 00:31.714
We both decided to send that text to Coto.

00:31.748 --> 00:33.466
The only difference between you and me

00:33.500 --> 00:36.385
is I don't lie to myself about who I am

00:36.403 --> 00:38.454
or what I'm willing to do
to fight for what is right.

00:38.488 --> 00:40.222
We all heard. It's the whole unit.

00:40.257 --> 00:42.024
What's the whole unit?

00:42.059 --> 00:43.225
The redeployment.

00:43.260 --> 00:44.360
Back to Afghanistan.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.295
End of the month. They're
sending a few of us back

00:46.330 --> 00:47.262
to train the new police.

00:49.833 --> 00:51.767
<i>(Rock music playing)</i>

00:55.205 --> 00:57.974
<i>* me and my big friends... *</i>

00:58.063 --> 00:59.063
Howdy, soldier.

01:00.916 --> 01:01.965
Hey there.

01:01.983 --> 01:04.702
Thought we were meeting up tonight.

01:04.736 --> 01:07.638
Yeah, but I have this really great idea

01:07.672 --> 01:08.606
and it felt kind of pressing.

01:08.640 --> 01:10.408
All right.

01:10.442 --> 01:12.259
What's up?

01:12.294 --> 01:13.310
So this whole redeployment thing.

01:13.344 --> 01:14.528
I've been looking up ways

01:14.563 --> 01:16.464
that you could maybe get out of it.

01:18.133 --> 01:19.183
I'm not gonna do that.

01:19.217 --> 01:21.035
Okay, just hear me out.

01:21.069 --> 01:22.370
There's injury, of course,

01:22.404 --> 01:24.422
but you're a picture of health,
so that's not gonna work;

01:24.456 --> 01:26.123
P.T.S.D., which you don't have;

01:26.158 --> 01:27.158
or you could object conscientiously.

01:27.192 --> 01:29.043
- Bay...
- You already went over there,

01:29.094 --> 01:30.160
and it was bad for you.

01:30.178 --> 01:31.128
Why do you have to go back?

01:31.163 --> 01:33.130
Because I made a commitment.

01:33.165 --> 01:34.732
All right? I'm gonna be fine.

01:34.766 --> 01:36.767
You don't know that.

01:37.869 --> 01:40.721
Well, that's just kind of the deal

01:40.756 --> 01:42.573
when you're with somebody in the military.

01:42.607 --> 01:44.675
But I was reading about some guys

01:44.709 --> 01:46.761
who got a few politicians to sign a letter

01:46.845 --> 01:49.513
so that they could get
discharged honorably,

01:49.548 --> 01:51.682
and I was thinking maybe
we could talk to my dad.

01:51.716 --> 01:53.551
No! Absolutely not.

01:53.585 --> 01:56.220
Okay.

01:56.254 --> 01:58.155
Look, hey.

01:58.190 --> 02:01.275
Can we just try and enjoy
the time that we have left?

02:01.326 --> 02:03.077
Can we do that?

02:05.130 --> 02:06.897
Yeah.

02:06.915 --> 02:07.865
You're right. I'm sorry.

02:07.899 --> 02:09.166
I want that, too.

02:09.201 --> 02:11.135
All right.

02:11.153 --> 02:12.837
Are you off tomorrow?

02:12.871 --> 02:13.871
Yep.

02:13.905 --> 02:16.674
Okay. Well, I was thinking

02:16.708 --> 02:17.942
maybe we'd go up to Clinton Lake?

02:17.976 --> 02:19.944
Do some camping and hiking?

02:19.978 --> 02:20.911
That kind of thing?

02:22.614 --> 02:24.582
I mean, you go camping right?

02:24.616 --> 02:25.749
<i>- You're into that?
- Totally.</i>

02:25.784 --> 02:26.851
<i>- Uh-huh.
- We have a lake house.</i>

02:26.885 --> 02:28.385
We used to go all the time.

02:28.420 --> 02:30.688
Well, I'm not really talking about a cabin

02:30.722 --> 02:31.639
with central air.

02:31.673 --> 02:33.590
I'm talking about sleeping bags, tents.

02:33.608 --> 02:35.392
Whatevs. I'm in.

02:35.410 --> 02:37.294
What about your parents?

02:37.328 --> 02:38.429
They gonna be cool with it?

02:38.463 --> 02:42.066
It's just a matter of
asking the right parent.

02:44.469 --> 02:45.969
Hey.

02:45.987 --> 02:47.188
Where have you been?

02:47.239 --> 02:49.039
It was the weekend.

02:49.073 --> 02:52.059
No, I mean why haven't you
been returning my texts?

02:52.110 --> 02:54.211
I know we had a fight,

02:54.246 --> 02:56.630
but that's just a milestone.

02:56.681 --> 02:58.782
The first fight. It just means it's real.

02:58.817 --> 03:00.584
I don't know.

03:00.619 --> 03:01.802
I just have to process.

03:01.837 --> 03:04.472
Perhaps after we get off,

03:04.523 --> 03:06.740
we can go somewhere and process together?

03:06.791 --> 03:09.477
Maybe some grand larceny?

03:10.695 --> 03:11.695
It's a joke.

03:11.729 --> 03:13.547
I'm already late.

03:16.334 --> 03:18.185
Hey.

03:18.236 --> 03:19.453
Hey. I haven't
seen you since...

03:19.504 --> 03:21.222
Did you tell anyone about me and Coto?

03:21.256 --> 03:23.274
No. Why?

03:23.308 --> 03:26.377
He thinks someone knows.
He's kind of freaking out.

03:27.512 --> 03:30.080
People gossip. If someone saw something

03:30.098 --> 03:32.016
or there's a rumor going around,

03:32.050 --> 03:35.102
it's not your fault. Just let it pass.

03:35.136 --> 03:36.270
He'll cool down.

03:36.304 --> 03:38.355
Yeah. You're right.

03:40.358 --> 03:42.193
And thank you for being there for me

03:42.227 --> 03:43.310
through all the drama.

03:43.361 --> 03:45.112
Sure thing.

04:03.248 --> 04:04.298
John?

04:04.332 --> 04:06.050
Yeah? (Grunts)

04:06.084 --> 04:07.334
Did you get demoted?

04:07.385 --> 04:09.420
(Laughs) Let me tell you something:

04:09.454 --> 04:11.255
any boss afraid of getting his hands dirty

04:11.289 --> 04:13.224
has no business being the boss.

04:13.258 --> 04:17.261
Well, I finished measuring
your waiting room and your...

04:17.295 --> 04:19.313
Are those new hubcaps?

04:19.346 --> 04:22.149
Yep, tires too.

04:22.183 --> 04:24.268
You really didn't have to do that.

04:24.302 --> 04:25.436
I mean, a free car wash is one thing...

04:25.470 --> 04:27.187
Regina, the old tires were shot.

04:27.239 --> 04:29.073
They weren't safe to drive on.

04:29.107 --> 04:30.357
No big deal.

04:30.408 --> 04:32.159
Thank you.

04:32.193 --> 04:33.994
It's very sweet.

04:34.029 --> 04:35.246
I should get started on these.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.481
Oh, well, after you.

04:40.335 --> 04:41.285
- Thanks.
- Yep.

04:43.371 --> 04:45.339
There you go.

04:46.374 --> 04:48.208
It's all yours.

04:48.260 --> 04:49.326
- Thanks.
- Bye.

06:03.284 --> 06:06.337
Bay, is this yours or mine?

06:06.371 --> 06:08.288
Um...

06:08.340 --> 06:10.073
Oh, yours. I don't pad.

06:10.091 --> 06:12.409
(Chuckles) Oh yes.

06:12.427 --> 06:15.179
You get those blessings from Angelo's mom.

06:15.213 --> 06:17.247
Remind me to thank him.

06:17.265 --> 06:19.299
Actually that's weird. Don't.

06:19.351 --> 06:20.351
(Chuckles)

06:20.385 --> 06:22.085
That however is mine.

06:22.103 --> 06:24.087
Oh. Do you mind?

06:24.105 --> 06:26.273
- Not at all.
- Thank you.

06:31.363 --> 06:32.980
So...

06:33.031 --> 06:36.984
I was thinking about going
camping with Ty tomorrow.

06:38.370 --> 06:41.205
Like... alone?

06:41.239 --> 06:43.207
We're being safe,

06:43.241 --> 06:46.160
and Ty and I really care about each other.

06:46.211 --> 06:48.328
And I'm gonna be away at college in a year.

06:48.380 --> 06:50.414
And I really think you should trust me.

06:50.448 --> 06:53.167
Are you planning on
telling John and Kathryn?

06:53.218 --> 06:54.301
What do you think?

06:54.335 --> 06:56.420
Then you need to ask me

06:56.454 --> 06:58.138
if you can go camping with some friends.

06:58.173 --> 06:59.956
What?

06:59.974 --> 07:02.393
Ask me if you can go camping with friends.

07:02.427 --> 07:04.094
That way when John and Kathryn ask me

07:04.128 --> 07:05.095
where you said where you were going,

07:05.129 --> 07:06.146
I won't be lying.

07:07.315 --> 07:09.299
Can I go camping with some friends?

07:09.317 --> 07:11.134
Which ones?

07:11.152 --> 07:13.187
Mary Beth, Mac and Ty.

07:13.238 --> 07:15.138
That's a nice group.

07:17.025 --> 07:19.142
Okay. You can go.

07:19.160 --> 07:20.327
Just watch out for the Poison Ivy, huh?

07:22.163 --> 07:24.081
Poison Ivy. Sure. (Chuckles)

07:25.366 --> 07:27.951
Oh, Daphne.

07:27.985 --> 07:29.987
Daphne. Great news.

07:30.021 --> 07:32.840
Tell me you got the copier to staple sort?

07:32.874 --> 07:35.926
No. Senator Coto is starting
an intern of the year program.

07:35.944 --> 07:37.861
It's sort of his way of honoring the top

07:37.896 --> 07:39.696
intern in the building
for a summer of hard work.

07:39.731 --> 07:40.798
Uh-huh.

07:40.832 --> 07:42.032
There's some pretty substantial

07:42.066 --> 07:44.734
scholarship money attached for the winner.

07:44.753 --> 07:46.603
He wants to interview you tomorrow.

07:46.638 --> 07:47.805
Oh.

07:47.839 --> 07:49.656
9:00 am. His office.

07:49.691 --> 07:51.608
And whether or not you win the scholarship,

07:51.643 --> 07:54.378
it is great that you made such a
strong impression on the Senator.

07:54.412 --> 07:55.446
Nice work.

07:59.384 --> 08:02.352
And I'll put aunt minty with
all the girls from the office.

08:02.386 --> 08:04.371
She'll probably talk their
ear off about Mary Kay,

08:04.422 --> 08:07.274
but what the hell? A couple of them
could use some freshening up, right?

08:07.308 --> 08:09.910
Aunt Minty is Nikki's dad's little sister.

08:09.961 --> 08:11.195
Sounds great.

08:11.229 --> 08:13.981
And then Lenny is the
oldest of the Papagus boys.

08:14.032 --> 08:15.265
He'll be a little quiet at first,

08:15.283 --> 08:17.134
until he has his first highball.

08:17.168 --> 08:19.770
- Right, Nikki?
- Was dad selling drugs?

08:23.091 --> 08:24.107
What?

08:24.142 --> 08:27.578
Was dad shot because he was selling drugs?

08:28.880 --> 08:30.430
Why would you ask that?

08:30.482 --> 08:31.482
It's all my fault.

08:31.516 --> 08:33.616
We went to see the guy who...

08:33.650 --> 08:34.802
The guy who killed dad.

08:36.554 --> 08:38.539
He said he was buying drugs from dad.

08:39.591 --> 08:41.291
You took her to a prison?

08:41.326 --> 08:43.494
Nikki was really upset, so I
thought it would be a good idea...

08:43.528 --> 08:44.528
So was he?

08:44.546 --> 08:47.181
I'm not gonna answer that.

08:47.232 --> 08:48.182
Oh my God.

08:48.233 --> 08:50.033
Why would you take her there?

08:50.068 --> 08:51.201
I'm so sorry.

08:51.235 --> 08:53.887
You knew about this?

08:57.091 --> 08:59.059
Nikki, he was a good father.

08:59.110 --> 09:00.828
He just...

09:01.946 --> 09:03.080
I can't believe this.

09:03.114 --> 09:05.048
<i>- Hey.
- All the drivers were doing it</i>

09:05.082 --> 09:06.900
just to get through their shifts.

09:06.951 --> 09:08.902
And then he ended up with a couple extra,

09:08.953 --> 09:09.887
and one thing led to...

09:09.921 --> 09:11.522
I can't believe you.

09:11.556 --> 09:13.557
I didn't approve of it, okay?

09:13.575 --> 09:14.825
And by the time I found out,

09:14.859 --> 09:16.593
he was so far into it he couldn't get out.

09:16.628 --> 09:18.729
<i>He thought we needed the money.</i>

09:18.763 --> 09:20.564
We did need the money.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.434
Nikki, hey.

09:27.138 --> 09:30.090
You know, I've thought about
telling her a million times.

09:31.359 --> 09:33.293
I don't know that it would
have gone any different.

09:49.523 --> 09:50.740
Honey?

09:52.576 --> 09:54.477
What are you still doing at home?

09:54.511 --> 09:55.511
Shouldn't you be at work?

09:55.545 --> 09:58.314
I'm not feeling very well.

09:58.348 --> 09:59.499
Is it your head?

09:59.550 --> 10:01.350
It's kind of everything.

10:01.385 --> 10:02.351
Oh.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.204
Huh.

10:05.255 --> 10:07.273
No fever.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.242
(Coughs)

10:12.179 --> 10:14.130
I think I know what it is.

10:14.164 --> 10:15.164
You do?

10:15.199 --> 10:18.033
Bay used to get it all the time,

10:18.051 --> 10:20.703
especially when she didn't do her homework.

10:20.737 --> 10:21.971
It's called "faking it syndrome."

10:22.005 --> 10:24.674
(Sighs)

10:24.708 --> 10:27.627
- Was it the cough?
- Yeah.

10:27.661 --> 10:31.447
I think maybe next time you
should go with a stomach ailment.

10:31.481 --> 10:33.482
It's okay.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.717
You deserve a day off.

10:34.751 --> 10:36.519
It's just because...

10:36.553 --> 10:39.388
No, you don't have to explain.

10:39.423 --> 10:41.324
Tell you what.

10:41.358 --> 10:42.391
I'll call the office

10:42.426 --> 10:44.227
and tell them that you're not coming in,

10:44.261 --> 10:47.179
and you and I will have a spa day.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.181
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:49.233 --> 10:50.199
I could use a treat.

10:50.233 --> 10:53.836
I think a facial and a massage

10:53.870 --> 10:55.721
are just what the doctor ordered.

10:55.772 --> 10:56.706
Don't you?

10:56.740 --> 10:57.707
I would love that.

10:57.741 --> 10:59.842
You get dressed. I'll call the spa.

11:01.144 --> 11:02.695
(Sighs)

11:07.550 --> 11:08.868
Hey. I thought you were at work.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.420
Didn't go.

11:11.455 --> 11:13.356
(Breathing heavily)

11:14.775 --> 11:17.510
Hey, what's going on?

11:17.544 --> 11:19.729
I don't want to wait anymore.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.530
What?

11:28.138 --> 11:30.122
I... I can't believe I'm saying this,

11:30.173 --> 11:31.974
but are you sure?

11:32.009 --> 11:34.193
Because I know how much this means to you.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.295
It doesn't mean anything anymore.

11:36.330 --> 11:38.948
Nikki, what are you...

11:40.817 --> 11:42.151
I went and I talked to
Reverend Steve today.

11:42.185 --> 11:44.170
Do you know what he said?

11:44.221 --> 11:45.988
That I'm closer to God

11:46.023 --> 11:47.690
right now than I've ever been.

11:47.724 --> 11:50.493
Well, maybe he meant if you were...

11:50.527 --> 11:52.761
God is nowhere.

11:52.779 --> 11:56.332
He wasn't there when my
dad was selling drugs.

11:56.366 --> 11:59.251
He wasn't there when my
mother lied to me about it,

11:59.286 --> 12:01.220
and he definitely wasn't
there when that guy...

12:01.271 --> 12:02.204
Hey hey hey.

12:02.239 --> 12:03.456
You're obviously upset.

12:03.490 --> 12:04.606
Toby, I don't...

12:06.460 --> 12:08.394
I don't want to get married in that church.

12:08.445 --> 12:11.330
We don't have to decide anything right now.

12:11.365 --> 12:12.431
I mean, there's so much going on,

12:12.466 --> 12:14.216
let's just take a second.

12:14.250 --> 12:15.384
(Sighs)

12:15.402 --> 12:19.005
So I'm thinking of getting a hydro-facial.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.256
Is that the one with the machine

12:20.290 --> 12:22.108
that sucks the stuff out of your face?

12:22.142 --> 12:23.909
<i>- Yes.
- (Indistinct arguing)</i>

12:32.669 --> 12:33.969
What's wrong?

12:34.003 --> 12:36.739
<i>(Arguing continues)</i>

12:36.773 --> 12:37.740
Nothing.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.475
<i>I thought I heard something,</i>

12:39.509 --> 12:41.444
but it's just the A.C.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.184
(Sighs)

12:51.965 --> 12:53.099
Whoa. 

12:53.133 --> 12:54.333
- You okay?
- Oh yeah.

12:54.368 --> 12:56.285
Nothing but nailing it back here.

12:56.336 --> 12:58.170
You're doing great.

12:58.188 --> 13:00.973
As long as I don't have
to pee in a hole, I'm good.

13:01.007 --> 13:02.107
(Chuckles)

13:02.125 --> 13:03.743
Which I'm guessing I do.

13:03.777 --> 13:05.878
(Sighs)

13:05.896 --> 13:07.713
Oh, almost there.

13:09.049 --> 13:10.816
Almost where?

13:16.573 --> 13:17.890
What do you think?

13:19.526 --> 13:20.610
I think it's fun to look at.

13:20.661 --> 13:21.577
(Chuckles)

13:21.612 --> 13:22.728
Yeah, it's pretty sweet, huh?

13:22.779 --> 13:26.332
Sure, if you're into that sort of thing.

13:32.589 --> 13:35.341
We used to do some
stuff like this in basic.

13:35.375 --> 13:38.144
All right. Helmet, gloves...

13:38.178 --> 13:40.279
Carabineers...

13:40.314 --> 13:41.497
And rope.

13:41.548 --> 13:42.548
(Chuckles nervously)

13:42.582 --> 13:45.051
I thought that thing was full of snacks.

13:45.085 --> 13:46.118
You brought all this stuff?

13:46.153 --> 13:48.170
Yeah. I wanted to surprise you.

13:48.205 --> 13:50.106
Well, I'm surprised.

13:50.140 --> 13:52.758
It's totally safe.

13:52.793 --> 13:54.076
You're gonna be in a
harness the whole time.

13:54.127 --> 13:55.795
And I'll be down here with the rope.

13:55.829 --> 13:58.864
How about I watch you do it?

13:58.898 --> 14:00.917
Bay, you really need to...

14:00.968 --> 14:02.602
learn to leave your comfort zone.

14:02.636 --> 14:03.819
Why? Why do I have to do that?

14:03.870 --> 14:06.756
You kind of sound like
a princess right now.

14:06.790 --> 14:08.641
Okay. Low blow.

14:08.675 --> 14:10.576
Do not play the "just 'cause
I live in Mission Hills

14:10.611 --> 14:11.661
I'm a princess" card.

14:11.695 --> 14:13.763
Well then, prove me wrong.

14:13.797 --> 14:16.515
What is this? Some sort
of military mind game?

14:16.533 --> 14:19.168
I don't have the Kennish
gene for athletics, okay?

14:19.219 --> 14:20.186
I just don't.

14:22.155 --> 14:24.090
Look. You can tell yourself that

14:24.124 --> 14:26.392
and you can keep making it
true the rest of your life,

14:26.426 --> 14:28.995
or you can redefine yourself.

14:29.029 --> 14:31.297
(Breathes heavily )

14:31.331 --> 14:34.300
You're gonna feel so awesome

14:34.334 --> 14:35.901
when it's done.

14:35.936 --> 14:37.003
Okay?

14:39.740 --> 14:40.773
Fine.

14:41.908 --> 14:43.759
All right. Let's get you harnessed.

14:51.735 --> 14:53.486
<i>(Door opens)</i>

14:59.293 --> 15:00.443
How was it?

15:00.494 --> 15:03.312
Amazing.

15:03.347 --> 15:04.480
Thank you so much.

15:04.514 --> 15:07.433
And how's your fake headache?

15:07.467 --> 15:09.251
It was that fake cough,

15:09.303 --> 15:11.354
but it's all gone now.

15:11.388 --> 15:12.355
(Chuckles)

15:12.406 --> 15:13.990
I've missed you so much.

15:14.041 --> 15:15.975
You've been so busy at the office

15:16.009 --> 15:17.042
and with your new guy...

15:17.060 --> 15:19.078
who I haven't met, by the way.

15:19.112 --> 15:21.113
His name is Jace?

15:21.131 --> 15:22.715
Is that right?

15:22.749 --> 15:23.749
Yeah.

15:23.784 --> 15:24.917
What's he like?

15:26.003 --> 15:27.887
Um, confident.

15:27.921 --> 15:29.555
Smart.

15:29.589 --> 15:31.991
Almost too smart for his own good.

15:32.025 --> 15:33.792
Is it serious?

15:33.810 --> 15:36.562
Well, we...

15:36.596 --> 15:38.648
connect on politics.

15:38.682 --> 15:40.483
And we have a lot of the same values.

15:41.585 --> 15:43.285
But?

15:43.337 --> 15:44.370
<i>Diana: Kathryn?</i>

15:45.522 --> 15:47.206
Diana.

15:49.075 --> 15:50.309
Diana, this is my daughter, Daphne.

15:50.344 --> 15:52.945
Daphne, this is Diana Coto,

15:52.979 --> 15:54.196
Senator Coto's wife.

15:55.882 --> 15:57.183
It's nice to meet you.

15:57.250 --> 15:58.818
You too.

15:58.852 --> 15:59.785
I've heard about you.

15:59.820 --> 16:00.753
Oh.

16:01.855 --> 16:03.689
You know what? We're playing hooky.

16:03.724 --> 16:04.824
John doesn't even know,

16:04.858 --> 16:06.792
so don't rat us out.

16:06.827 --> 16:07.927
Of course not.

16:07.961 --> 16:09.929
Chip's been pretty crazed at work himself.

16:09.963 --> 16:11.864
I think there's something brewing.

16:11.898 --> 16:14.433
I'm gonna use the ladies' room.

16:14.468 --> 16:16.452
I'll be right back.

16:25.256 --> 16:27.190
<i>I bet it's nice having a girl.</i>

16:27.224 --> 16:28.241
I have two boys

16:28.276 --> 16:30.027
and they drive me nuts.

16:30.061 --> 16:31.261
It is nice.

16:31.296 --> 16:32.262
Does she tell you a lot?

16:32.296 --> 16:34.031
Uh, I don't know.

16:34.065 --> 16:35.115
Sometimes. It's a tricky age.

16:35.166 --> 16:37.934
Does she ever talk about work?

16:37.969 --> 16:39.936
Sometimes.

16:39.971 --> 16:41.738
Do you ever...

16:41.773 --> 16:42.906
hear anything?

16:42.940 --> 16:44.675
Has she ever mentioned Chip?

16:44.709 --> 16:46.609
I don't think she knows him very well...

16:46.628 --> 16:48.779
I mean, I don't even know him.

16:48.813 --> 16:50.480
I've seen him act like this before...

16:50.514 --> 16:53.600
taking the dogs on
extra walks after dinner,

16:53.635 --> 16:54.718
irritable all the time,

16:54.752 --> 16:57.387
and I catch him in little lies

16:57.422 --> 16:58.522
about nothing.

16:58.556 --> 17:00.257
His Chief of Staff avoids my eye

17:00.291 --> 17:02.092
any time I stop by.

17:02.126 --> 17:05.095
There's something going on. I can feel it.

17:05.128 --> 17:07.030
It's an intern.

17:07.065 --> 17:10.267
You think Chip is having
an affair with an intern?

17:10.300 --> 17:12.969
It happened before, years ago.

17:13.003 --> 17:16.073
She was 24. She worshipped him.

17:16.107 --> 17:18.974
You know he can't resist that.

17:19.010 --> 17:20.643
We saw a therapist.

17:20.662 --> 17:21.862
I thought we worked through it.

17:21.913 --> 17:25.816
Well, all marriages
have their ups and downs.

17:25.849 --> 17:26.916
Can you just ask Daphne?

17:26.951 --> 17:30.337
You know, see if she knows anything?

17:30.388 --> 17:32.522
You know, girls talk to
each other at that age.

17:32.557 --> 17:33.573
(Sighs)

17:33.608 --> 17:35.375
Oh God.

17:35.410 --> 17:37.144
That was awful.

17:37.178 --> 17:38.345
I'm sorry. Forget it.

17:38.396 --> 17:39.363
Of course you can't.

17:39.397 --> 17:41.064
I'm gonna get going.

17:41.099 --> 17:42.299
It was nice seeing you.

17:42.333 --> 17:43.934
Nice seeing you, too.

17:46.070 --> 17:48.838
(Sighs)

17:53.778 --> 17:55.045
Hi.

17:55.079 --> 17:56.079
May I help you?

17:56.114 --> 17:57.047
I certainly hope so.

17:57.081 --> 17:58.115
John Kennish.

17:58.149 --> 17:59.616
Kennish Car Wash.

17:59.634 --> 18:00.750
Yes, the very same.

18:00.768 --> 18:03.553
I need to speak to you
about Regina Vasquez.

18:03.588 --> 18:04.955
Is there a problem?

18:04.989 --> 18:06.556
Yes.

18:06.624 --> 18:09.793
You see, Regina has
done such an amazing job

18:09.827 --> 18:12.729
that my Senate office looks
like a dump by comparison.

18:14.432 --> 18:16.266
I am so sorry to hear that.

18:16.300 --> 18:17.417
She's left me no choice

18:17.468 --> 18:19.302
but to hire her to fix it.

18:19.336 --> 18:21.121
So how do I get that started?

18:21.155 --> 18:24.074
You can write the address down here

18:24.108 --> 18:26.143
and then we will schedule
a walk-through of the space.

18:26.177 --> 18:27.978
Fantastic.

18:28.012 --> 18:29.279
Dean?

18:31.933 --> 18:34.017
Could you get these
samples to Mr. Sorrento?

18:34.035 --> 18:36.153
Thank you.

18:36.187 --> 18:37.888
Angelo Sorrento?

18:37.922 --> 18:38.839
Yes.

18:38.890 --> 18:39.923
We're doing his restaurant

18:39.941 --> 18:41.057
over in the power and light district.

18:41.075 --> 18:42.592
Do you know him?

18:42.627 --> 18:44.678
Well, he's a member of the family,

18:44.729 --> 18:45.679
sort of,

18:45.730 --> 18:46.797
being married to Regina and all.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.651
Okey-doke. That takes care of that.

18:51.686 --> 18:53.653
Thank you.

18:53.704 --> 18:55.539
Well, thanks again.

18:55.573 --> 18:56.673
Of course.

18:58.676 --> 19:01.411
<i>- (Door opens)
- (Sighs)</i>

19:03.147 --> 19:04.147
Is that tight enough?

19:04.182 --> 19:05.482
I have no idea.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.200
You comfortable?

19:07.251 --> 19:09.136
Oh, never better.

19:11.989 --> 19:13.073
Okay.

19:13.124 --> 19:15.058
All set.

19:15.092 --> 19:16.176
Up you go.

19:20.998 --> 19:22.132
Everything's gonna be fine.

19:22.166 --> 19:23.867
I got you.

19:23.901 --> 19:26.787
There's a special place in
hell for boyfriends like you.

19:26.821 --> 19:27.888
(Chuckles)

19:29.740 --> 19:30.657
Attagirl.

19:36.747 --> 19:38.665

19:40.885 --> 19:44.287
<i>Ty: Take it nice and slow.</i>

19:44.322 --> 19:45.238
There you go.

19:45.289 --> 19:46.289
All right.

19:46.324 --> 19:47.424
Good job.

19:47.458 --> 19:48.458
You're doing good.

19:48.493 --> 19:51.278
<i>That's the way to do it, Bay.</i>

19:51.312 --> 19:53.113
I took the day off,

19:53.164 --> 19:55.382
but then Chip Coto's wife showed up.

19:55.433 --> 19:57.033
She must know something.

19:57.068 --> 19:58.318
You're being paranoid.

19:58.369 --> 20:01.104
She doesn't know anything.
It's a coincidence.

20:01.138 --> 20:03.172
Listen, you have to get back here.

20:03.191 --> 20:05.108
<i>Mark was just here asking for you.</i>

20:05.142 --> 20:07.076
You missed your interview with Coto.

20:07.094 --> 20:08.762
That was the point.

20:08.813 --> 20:10.197
You cannot panic or alter your routine.

20:10.248 --> 20:11.865
Now that is how people get caught.

20:11.916 --> 20:13.750
I know it's scary.

20:13.784 --> 20:15.068
But you have to get good at this.

20:15.102 --> 20:16.887
You mean good at lying?

20:16.954 --> 20:18.505
Yes.

20:18.556 --> 20:20.524
We know why we did what we did,

20:20.558 --> 20:22.559
but we do not want to be in a position

20:22.593 --> 20:23.827
<i>of having to explain ourselves.</i>

20:23.861 --> 20:25.729
I have to go.

20:31.302 --> 20:33.520
Did Diana leave?

20:33.571 --> 20:35.438
Yes. Why?

20:35.456 --> 20:37.373
Nothing.

20:37.391 --> 20:39.075
Wait, are you okay?

20:39.110 --> 20:40.243
Yeah.

20:40.278 --> 20:41.328
What's going on at work?

20:41.379 --> 20:45.065
Is something making you feel uncomfortable?

20:46.117 --> 20:48.251
Is Cchip Coto hitting on you?

20:48.285 --> 20:50.070
What?! No!

20:50.104 --> 20:53.757
- Are you involved with him?
- God no! Who told you that?

20:53.791 --> 20:55.925
Nobody. It's just...

20:55.943 --> 20:57.744
Kathryn, that's gross.

20:57.778 --> 20:59.763
Why would you think that?

20:59.797 --> 21:01.514
Well, because of what
happened with the chef.

21:01.566 --> 21:02.765
Oh my God. No.

21:02.783 --> 21:05.452
I have to take a shower
and then go to work.

21:05.503 --> 21:06.620
There's something I have to do.

21:06.671 --> 21:07.837
I'll just see you at home.

21:15.316 --> 21:16.966
___

21:17.997 --> 21:18.829

21:19.130 --> 21:19.830

21:32.855 --> 21:34.954

21:46.751 --> 21:48.878
- ___
- (Softly) Hi.

21:51.265 --> 21:52.728
___

21:56.420 --> 21:57.487
Melody.

21:57.521 --> 21:59.322
<i>Wow.</i>

21:59.340 --> 22:03.226
Your parents should have
just named you "Irony."

22:03.260 --> 22:08.098
<i>You know, because Melody
is music and you're...</i>

22:08.132 --> 22:09.366
Sorry.

22:09.367 --> 22:13.404
___

22:15.006 --> 22:16.906
<i>Well, talk about irony.</i>

22:16.941 --> 22:19.242
Who's idea was it to name that woman Joy?

22:19.276 --> 22:20.777
(Laughs)

22:24.882 --> 22:27.717
I'm sure this is all really weird for you.

22:30.418 --> 22:31.605
___

22:32.823 --> 22:34.541
Okay.

22:34.575 --> 22:36.393
Who's ready to get turned on?

22:37.590 --> 22:41.361
___

22:41.379 --> 22:44.234
Emmett. It's nice to meet you.

22:44.268 --> 22:45.468
You want one of these bad boys too?

22:45.502 --> 22:47.437
Get you all wired up.

22:48.260 --> 22:50.378
___

22:50.384 --> 22:52.392
Yeah. My own dad doesn't want one.

22:52.443 --> 22:54.110
Doesn't trust them.

22:54.145 --> 22:57.313
<i>His own son programs the things,</i>

22:57.348 --> 23:00.250
<i>and he refuses. What are you gonna do?</i>

23:01.930 --> 23:05.440
___

23:05.455 --> 23:07.991
Wow. Your ex?

23:08.025 --> 23:09.042
Cameron, are you nuts?

23:09.093 --> 23:10.660
What are you thinking?

23:10.695 --> 23:12.779
No offense, Debbie.

23:12.830 --> 23:14.030
None taken.

23:14.048 --> 23:15.665
No, but seriously.

23:15.700 --> 23:17.600
I'm very impressed that you're here today.

23:17.618 --> 23:18.568
Today can be a hard day,

23:18.586 --> 23:19.536
and it's very cool of you.

23:21.362 --> 23:22.996
___

23:23.397 --> 23:24.705
___

23:24.706 --> 23:26.309
(Chuckles)

23:29.430 --> 23:31.181
Ready to get started?

23:31.215 --> 23:32.281
(Exhales)

23:33.267 --> 23:34.300
Okay.

23:35.436 --> 23:37.203
That's good.

23:37.238 --> 23:39.055
There you go, Bay.

23:39.090 --> 23:41.057
Rung by rung.

23:41.092 --> 23:42.258
<i>Take it nice and slow.</i>

23:42.276 --> 23:44.160
<i>You're almost there. A few more.</i>

23:44.195 --> 23:45.295
<i>Good job.</i>

23:45.329 --> 23:46.329
<i>You're doing good.</i>

23:49.767 --> 23:51.701
(Panting)

23:55.973 --> 23:58.074
<i>All right. There you go.</i>

23:58.109 --> 23:59.576
<i>Breathe.</i>

23:59.610 --> 24:00.877
(Creaking)

24:03.881 --> 24:05.749
(Chuckles)

24:05.783 --> 24:07.550
I did it!

24:09.455 --> 24:11.356
Okay. Well that kind of sucked,

24:11.390 --> 24:13.324
but you know what? It
is kind of nice up here.

24:15.344 --> 24:16.428
Oh... Ahh.

24:16.462 --> 24:18.146
Ha. Okay.

24:18.180 --> 24:20.131
I saw it. How do I get down?

24:20.166 --> 24:21.199
You jump.

24:21.233 --> 24:23.351
- What?
- You jump,

24:23.386 --> 24:25.136
and I belay you down.

24:25.154 --> 24:27.155
I'm not gonna jump.

24:27.189 --> 24:28.973
I'm gonna catch your weight, okay?

24:29.008 --> 24:30.075
I'll lower you down.

24:30.109 --> 24:31.710
Uh, no.

24:31.744 --> 24:32.944
I'm gonna use the ladder.

24:32.962 --> 24:34.746
No no no no! Don't.

24:34.780 --> 24:36.014
<i>That's actually more dangerous, okay?</i>

24:36.048 --> 24:37.982
<i>The rope, it can get caught in the rungs.</i>

24:40.753 --> 24:42.520
You gotta jump.

24:42.555 --> 24:45.790
Uh, that is not gonna happen.

24:48.360 --> 24:49.427
You can't stay up there forever.

24:49.462 --> 24:51.296
Yeah, I can see that. Thanks.

24:51.330 --> 24:52.430
Okay, I'm...

24:52.465 --> 24:53.681
I'm gonna pull you down, all right?

24:55.234 --> 24:57.135
Wait. What do you mean by that?

24:57.169 --> 24:59.404
Take the rope and position
it behind your head.

25:03.459 --> 25:05.243
<i>Okay, good. All right.</i>

25:05.261 --> 25:06.945
<i>Now you just stay relaxed.</i>

25:06.979 --> 25:09.280
I need you to step off.
I'm gonna take your weight.

25:09.315 --> 25:10.999
Okay.

25:12.935 --> 25:14.853
I've got you, okay? You just stay relaxed.

25:14.887 --> 25:15.904
(Breathes heavily)

25:18.057 --> 25:19.924
(Screams)

25:19.942 --> 25:21.743
<i>- (Screaming)
- Hey hey!</i>

25:21.794 --> 25:22.761
Bay! Stop!

25:22.795 --> 25:23.862
Stop moving around!

25:23.896 --> 25:25.563
Come on. Relax!

25:25.598 --> 25:27.465
- Bay!
- (Grunts)

25:28.467 --> 25:29.484
Bay, are you okay?

25:29.518 --> 25:31.302
Get this thing off of me.

25:31.320 --> 25:32.370
Come here. Come here.

25:32.404 --> 25:34.372
(Grunts)

25:34.406 --> 25:35.590
All right. All right.

25:35.624 --> 25:37.475
What the hell was that?!

25:37.510 --> 25:40.311
Was this some kind of test?

25:40.362 --> 25:43.064
I don't know. This is just like...

25:43.099 --> 25:45.350
something you do when you want
to see what somebody's made of.

25:45.384 --> 25:47.018
I didn't think you were gonna get hurt.

25:47.052 --> 25:48.286
So it was a test.

25:48.304 --> 25:51.923
Of what? To see how tough I am?

25:51.957 --> 25:54.959
You know, it's going to be
really hard when I'm gone.

25:54.977 --> 25:56.761
Don't you think I know that?

25:56.796 --> 25:59.731
What, was this to see how
well I would handle it?

25:59.765 --> 26:01.800
Do you think I'm gonna
cheat on you or something?

26:03.002 --> 26:08.773
- Is this about Emmett?
- Maybe.

26:08.807 --> 26:10.608
(Angrily) Seriously?

26:12.561 --> 26:14.696
Don't talk to me. Don't follow me.

26:14.730 --> 26:16.647
- Just leave me alone!
- (Clatters)

26:25.103 --> 26:27.938
<i>- (Door opens)
- (Regina sighs)</i>

26:27.956 --> 26:30.708
<i>- Sorry. I had to go two places...
- (Door closes)</i>

26:30.742 --> 26:32.476
To get soy.

26:32.511 --> 26:34.445
There you go.

26:39.551 --> 26:40.751
You're not wearing your wedding ring.

26:40.769 --> 26:42.353
What?

26:42.387 --> 26:44.422
I remember you said

26:44.456 --> 26:46.557
that Angelo didn't wear one.

26:46.591 --> 26:48.459
Is that something you
guys decided together?

26:48.493 --> 26:50.127
Um...

26:50.162 --> 26:52.296
John Kennish came by today

26:52.331 --> 26:54.365
to rave about all the work
you're doing on his car wash.

26:54.399 --> 26:58.336
He didn't seem to know that
your marriage was a secret.

26:58.370 --> 27:00.271
I'm so sorry.

27:02.074 --> 27:04.091
You let me make a fool of myself.

27:04.142 --> 27:05.059
No, you didn't.

27:05.093 --> 27:06.944
I didn't know what to do.

27:06.978 --> 27:08.813
I mean, I wanted this job so badly,

27:08.847 --> 27:10.114
I knew I needed to bring in clients,

27:10.148 --> 27:11.849
and Angelo had that restaurant.

27:13.735 --> 27:15.720
But I should have said something,

27:15.754 --> 27:16.954
and I'm sorry I didn't.

27:16.988 --> 27:18.856
Look, well,

27:18.874 --> 27:20.758
I probably stepped on the third rail,

27:20.792 --> 27:22.760
asking you to hook me up with your client.

27:25.464 --> 27:28.399
Look, let's just put all this
aside, okay? We'll start over.

27:28.433 --> 27:31.168
Full time?

27:31.203 --> 27:32.536
Yes.

27:32.587 --> 27:34.171
Really?

27:34.206 --> 27:35.306
Yeah.

27:35.340 --> 27:36.991
Oh!

27:37.025 --> 27:38.359
I'm trying to be cool here,

27:38.410 --> 27:40.344
but I'm really excited.

27:40.379 --> 27:41.896
Okay, just one question.

27:41.930 --> 27:42.980
John Kennish.

27:43.014 --> 27:44.031
Mm-hmm?

27:44.082 --> 27:45.166
Is he married?

27:45.200 --> 27:46.984
Um...

27:47.018 --> 27:49.070
Regina. I'm kidding.

27:49.104 --> 27:51.188
(Chuckles)

27:51.206 --> 27:52.873
But I got you.

27:52.924 --> 27:55.059
Yes, you did.

27:56.828 --> 27:58.662
(Sighs)

27:58.697 --> 28:01.532
<i>Hi, it's Bay. Leave a message.</i>

28:02.768 --> 28:03.868
You've got to be kidding me.

28:03.902 --> 28:06.537
(Shouting) Bay?

28:06.571 --> 28:08.572
Just come back. It's gonna be dark soon.

28:10.392 --> 28:11.642
I'm sorry.

28:13.662 --> 28:15.279
(Normal voice) Just come back.

28:16.748 --> 28:18.515
(Sighs)

28:20.552 --> 28:21.618
Can you hear anything now?

28:25.023 --> 28:26.991
(Keyboard clicking)

28:28.427 --> 28:29.894
What about now?

28:31.229 --> 28:33.898
<i>- Okay.
- (Keyboard clicking)</i>

28:42.774 --> 28:44.608
Just try to relax, okay?

28:45.811 --> 28:47.478
I'm gonna ask Debbie to come over

28:47.512 --> 28:49.680
and start talking to you in
a regular tone of voice, okay?

28:56.788 --> 29:00.424
Just let me know when you hear anything.

29:00.459 --> 29:01.392
Okay?

29:03.395 --> 29:05.463
Whenever you're ready.

29:05.497 --> 29:08.232
Hi, sweetheart.

29:08.266 --> 29:10.985
This is me talking.

29:11.019 --> 29:12.403
This is my voice.

29:12.437 --> 29:14.939
Can you hear me?

29:18.009 --> 29:19.109
<i>Debbie: Can you hear anything at all?</i>

29:19.144 --> 29:20.244
<i>Can you?</i>

29:22.130 --> 29:23.881
This is me talking.

29:23.915 --> 29:26.116
Can you hear me?

29:26.151 --> 29:27.785
Can you?

29:28.837 --> 29:31.655
You do? You hear what I'm saying?

29:31.690 --> 29:32.857
(Both chuckle)

29:32.891 --> 29:34.825
This is sound, darling.

29:34.859 --> 29:36.560
This is it.

29:40.765 --> 29:42.733
Say something. Try talking.

29:46.438 --> 29:47.555
Hello?

29:49.257 --> 29:50.541
(Chuckles)

29:50.575 --> 29:52.510
I can hear that.

29:52.544 --> 29:53.544
I hear my tongue.

29:53.578 --> 29:55.112
You sound great.

29:55.146 --> 29:56.497
This is fantastic.

29:56.548 --> 29:58.465
It is going perfectly.

30:02.003 --> 30:03.370
<i>Hello? Hello hello.</i>

30:03.421 --> 30:06.924
Hello. La la la.

30:08.093 --> 30:09.860
I can't believe it.

30:09.928 --> 30:12.129
- I'm so proud of you.
- Oh God.

30:13.091 --> 30:15.000
___

30:18.970 --> 30:21.872
<i>- (Cameron speaks, laughs)
- (Debbie laughs)</i>

30:31.516 --> 30:33.517
I was a little worried
when I heard you were sick.

30:33.551 --> 30:36.370
I guess you can't keep
the Kennishes down, huh?

30:36.421 --> 30:37.338
Speaking of, how's your dad?

30:37.372 --> 30:38.505
Much better, thanks.

30:38.557 --> 30:40.391
This morning he actually ate tofurkey.

30:40.425 --> 30:42.276
(Chuckles) Good.

30:42.327 --> 30:43.577
Well, as you know,

30:43.612 --> 30:45.379
I'm considering you for intern of the year,

30:45.430 --> 30:47.214
and I'm asking everyone the same question.

30:49.100 --> 30:51.969
Do you feel like you've made
a difference this summer?

30:53.939 --> 30:55.039
Well...

30:55.073 --> 30:57.157
to be honest, I mostly just took this job

30:57.208 --> 30:58.926
so I could spend more time with John.

30:58.977 --> 31:00.844
I'm not really interested in politics.

31:00.879 --> 31:01.879
Really?

31:01.913 --> 31:03.814
I have to say I'm surprised to hear that.

31:03.848 --> 31:05.633
I mean, I read about
what happened at Carlton.

31:05.684 --> 31:06.767
Well, that was different.

31:06.801 --> 31:07.918
I mean, it's my school.

31:07.936 --> 31:10.504
You know, I've interviewed
a dozen interns today,

31:10.555 --> 31:12.823
and you're the only one who
isn't shamelessly self-promoting.

31:12.857 --> 31:13.857
Why is that?

31:13.891 --> 31:16.794
I just mean...

31:16.828 --> 31:18.762
that I've been distracted a lot lately

31:18.813 --> 31:21.565
with my dad's heart attack and everything.

31:21.583 --> 31:24.184
I mean, let's face it... this job's
really just getting people lunch

31:24.219 --> 31:27.137
and doing whatever needs to
be done around the office.

31:27.172 --> 31:29.139
I'm a whiz with the copy machine.

31:29.174 --> 31:31.108
Oh.

31:31.142 --> 31:33.010
It's funny you should say that actually.

31:33.028 --> 31:35.145
I found this article...

31:35.180 --> 31:38.248
on abstinence-only education in my inbox

31:38.266 --> 31:40.918
the day before the education vote.

31:44.172 --> 31:47.942
Somebody said they saw you
distributing it around the office?

31:47.976 --> 31:50.694
I distribute a lot of material,

31:50.712 --> 31:52.813
not just stuff for my dad.

31:52.847 --> 31:54.765
Hmm.

31:54.783 --> 31:56.600
Well, that's too bad.

31:56.618 --> 31:58.636
This article was the
reason I changed my vote.

31:58.670 --> 32:00.671
It was?

32:00.705 --> 32:03.440
Well sure. I mean, it's
hard to argue with the facts.

32:03.475 --> 32:04.591
Right?

32:04.626 --> 32:06.710
Took a lot of flack from my own party,

32:06.745 --> 32:08.779
but I always say it's important
to vote with your conscience.

32:10.615 --> 32:13.384
You understand that's what I did, right?

32:15.387 --> 32:16.487
Yes.

32:16.521 --> 32:18.288
Of course you do.

32:18.323 --> 32:20.424
I can tell you really get how
things work around here, Daphne.

32:20.458 --> 32:23.127
You know, I'm not really
sure I'm following.

32:23.161 --> 32:24.378
I think you are.

32:24.412 --> 32:26.864
You know, politics can be a dirty business.

32:26.898 --> 32:29.166
I mean, people get entrenched
along ideological lines,

32:29.200 --> 32:31.802
they end up doing things
that can ruin lives.

32:31.836 --> 32:34.855
And when that happens, it's natural
for people to want to retaliate.

32:36.691 --> 32:37.858
And that can get really ugly,

32:37.909 --> 32:39.977
politically speaking of course.

32:40.011 --> 32:41.945
Of course.

32:41.980 --> 32:43.847
And there are always consequences.

32:52.615 --> 32:54.416
<i>(Keys jingle)</i>

32:54.467 --> 32:55.517
(Gasps)

32:57.536 --> 32:59.370
What happened?

32:59.405 --> 33:02.440
Coto knows everything.

33:02.475 --> 33:04.409
He said that?

33:04.443 --> 33:07.212
Not directly, but he made it pretty clear

33:07.246 --> 33:09.046
he's gonna retaliate somehow.

33:09.064 --> 33:10.214
He's bluffing.

33:10.232 --> 33:12.117
I don't think so.

33:12.151 --> 33:15.053
Even if he's not, we
still have the upper hand.

33:15.087 --> 33:17.188
He's a senator who changed his vote

33:17.222 --> 33:18.823
'cause he got his intern pregnant.

33:18.858 --> 33:21.860
We're just two kids
who sent a text message.

33:21.894 --> 33:22.977
We'll get a slap on the wrist,

33:23.012 --> 33:24.696
but his career will be over.

33:26.999 --> 33:28.032
What are you doing?

33:28.050 --> 33:29.834
I'm telling him that.

33:29.868 --> 33:31.803
Are you insane?

33:31.837 --> 33:33.738
I don't know who's
scaring me more right now,

33:33.772 --> 33:34.906
you or him.

33:34.940 --> 33:36.791
I'm not gonna let him win.

33:36.842 --> 33:38.393
Win?

33:38.427 --> 33:40.528
My God, I don't care about winning.

33:40.579 --> 33:42.464
I just want to stay out of jail.

33:42.498 --> 33:46.401
We have an opportunity here to
make some real change with this guy,

33:46.435 --> 33:48.403
to keep directing him towards votes

33:48.454 --> 33:50.321
that will actually help people.

33:50.356 --> 33:52.223
If we let him scare us off,

33:52.258 --> 33:53.558
things will go right
back to the way they were.

33:53.592 --> 33:55.360
Come on.

33:55.394 --> 33:58.196
David never gets to slay Goliath,

33:58.230 --> 33:59.481
not in real life.

33:59.515 --> 34:03.168
I'm sick of lying to everyone.

34:03.202 --> 34:04.969
This is not who I am

34:05.004 --> 34:07.272
and you and I are done.

34:09.824 --> 34:11.141
(Sighs)

34:14.897 --> 34:16.114
Can I have my phone back?

34:16.148 --> 34:18.716
I'm sorry.

34:21.719 --> 34:23.655
Yeah. Me too.

34:26.475 --> 34:27.592
What are you doing?

34:27.626 --> 34:29.427
I'm sending that text to Coto.

34:29.460 --> 34:30.828
Jace, please don't do that.

34:30.862 --> 34:33.630
You're not my girlfriend.

34:33.666 --> 34:35.516
I don't have to listen to you anymore.

34:37.536 --> 34:39.454
(Clicking)

34:49.380 --> 34:51.199
Oh. Hi, honey.

34:51.233 --> 34:53.016
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

34:53.052 --> 34:54.284
It's kind of important.

34:54.303 --> 34:56.337
Yeah. Of course.

34:56.388 --> 34:58.223
Um...

34:58.257 --> 35:01.109
things between Nikki and me

35:01.143 --> 35:02.860
have been...

35:04.196 --> 35:05.797
changing.

35:05.831 --> 35:07.065
Oh.

35:07.099 --> 35:09.000
Nothing bad, just...

35:09.034 --> 35:10.868
we're rethinking some things.

35:10.903 --> 35:13.705
And I was wondering...

35:15.608 --> 35:19.727
you think it's too late to have
the wedding here at the house

35:19.778 --> 35:20.862
instead of at a church?

35:24.667 --> 35:26.284
Oh. Uh...

35:26.318 --> 35:29.287
I mean, I know it's a
lot more work for us...

35:29.321 --> 35:31.222
well, and for you, obviously...

35:31.257 --> 35:32.340
but we'll keep it small,

35:32.391 --> 35:35.360
just family and just a few friends.

35:38.130 --> 35:42.400
Yeah. I think that would be lovely.

35:42.434 --> 35:45.069
You think dad would be okay with it?

35:45.087 --> 35:48.056
He'd be as happy about it as I am.

35:48.107 --> 35:49.857
Well, cool.

35:49.908 --> 35:51.108
Great, thanks.

35:51.126 --> 35:52.961
I'm gonna go call Nikki and tell her.

36:03.055 --> 36:04.822
(Grunting)

36:10.696 --> 36:11.779
What the hell?!

36:11.814 --> 36:13.581
I'm not talking to you.

36:13.616 --> 36:15.700
Well, so you just disappear
on me for two hours?

36:15.718 --> 36:17.518
I wanted to be by myself.

36:17.553 --> 36:19.437
I thought you were dead.

36:19.455 --> 36:20.604
Okay? Dead.

36:20.623 --> 36:22.573
Well, now you know how I felt

36:22.608 --> 36:24.342
when your freaking helicopter went down

36:24.376 --> 36:25.610
and I didn't know if you were on it.

36:25.644 --> 36:28.363
And how I'm gonna feel
every day when you're gone!

36:37.006 --> 36:39.157
Okay.

36:39.191 --> 36:41.259
But I...

36:41.293 --> 36:43.211
shouldn't have done that to you.

36:45.214 --> 36:47.799
I'm sorry.

36:47.833 --> 36:50.084
And I think I hurt my ankle, like bad.

36:50.119 --> 36:51.085
Ow.

36:51.120 --> 36:52.136
How bad?

36:52.171 --> 36:55.005
Like I think I have to go to an E.R.

36:55.024 --> 36:56.641
Let me see.

36:56.675 --> 36:57.742
Does that hurt?

36:57.776 --> 36:58.960
Mm-hmm.

36:58.994 --> 36:59.961
- Right there?
- Aah!

36:59.995 --> 37:01.612
All right. All right.

37:01.647 --> 37:03.881
Hang on.

37:03.899 --> 37:06.484
I'll get this stuff later.

37:06.502 --> 37:07.635
Come on.

37:17.702 --> 37:19.336
I am so sorry.

37:19.370 --> 37:21.588
(Chuckles) It's not that bad.

37:21.639 --> 37:23.373
People are gonna ask me how it happened,

37:23.391 --> 37:24.474
and every time I tell the story

37:24.492 --> 37:26.577
that platform's gonna get higher.

37:26.611 --> 37:28.295
Well, you looked pretty badass.

37:28.346 --> 37:30.180
Right.

37:30.215 --> 37:32.349
Still never doing that again. Ever.

37:32.383 --> 37:33.484
It's cool.

37:33.518 --> 37:35.185
I like you the way you are.

37:35.203 --> 37:36.320
Then you should treat me like it.

37:37.422 --> 37:39.339
I know.

37:39.390 --> 37:41.358
And I was thinking...

37:43.328 --> 37:44.962
let's talk to your dad.

37:44.996 --> 37:46.997
Really?

37:47.031 --> 37:48.232
Yeah.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.100
You know, maybe he can

37:50.118 --> 37:52.152
help me get stationed closer

37:52.203 --> 37:54.238
or stay put or something.

38:05.850 --> 38:07.551
(Door closes)

38:08.586 --> 38:11.405
(Knocks)

38:11.439 --> 38:12.589
Am I interrupting?

38:12.657 --> 38:15.526
I'm reading about medicaid adjustments.

38:15.560 --> 38:17.661
I am dying for someone to interrupt me.

38:17.695 --> 38:19.446
(Chuckles)

38:19.480 --> 38:21.615
I just wanted to let you know

38:21.649 --> 38:24.401
that you are looking at K&D's newest

38:24.435 --> 38:25.602
full-time design associate.

38:25.620 --> 38:29.639
Well, that is great news. You earned it.

38:29.657 --> 38:33.377
I'm sure your rave about the
car wash put it over the top.

38:33.411 --> 38:35.178
I just told the truth.

38:35.212 --> 38:36.480
If there's anything else I can do...

38:36.514 --> 38:39.149
- There is.
- Name it.

38:39.183 --> 38:40.384
You can stop.

38:42.253 --> 38:43.387
I appreciate everything,

38:43.421 --> 38:47.024
but you and I are now karmically even.

38:49.077 --> 38:51.278
I hope I'm not the reason
you haven't moved back here.

38:51.329 --> 38:54.164
No.

38:54.198 --> 38:55.899
It was a lot of things.

38:55.934 --> 38:58.886
Okay. I just...

39:00.805 --> 39:03.657
if you wanted to move
back, that would be fine.

39:04.993 --> 39:05.976
Thank you.

39:06.010 --> 39:07.844
