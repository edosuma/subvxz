found him.

00:10.401 --> 00:12.142
My ex-wife married
some rich tech dude

00:12.186 --> 00:13.578
who owns a ranch
just south of town.

00:13.622 --> 00:16.320
I followed her up here.
Her and my daughter.

00:16.364 --> 00:18.018
And let me guess,
you're still in love with her?

00:18.061 --> 00:19.323
I ran into Tonya.

00:19.367 --> 00:22.761
She's working for Ren Bhullar,
as in Bhullar cartel.

00:22.805 --> 00:24.024

00:26.156 --> 00:27.636

04:55.599 --> 04:58.123

came from Helena

and said that he mentioned
the Basin Trail.

05:02.214 --> 05:03.477

05:03.520 --> 05:05.305

and dressed like a prison guard.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.028
There goes the afternoon.

10:38.072 --> 10:40.248
Lovely.

10:45.296 --> 10:47.472
This her--
Faith Cole?

10:49.257 --> 10:50.519
Yes.

10:50.562 --> 10:51.651
Doing time
for armed robbery.

10:51.694 --> 10:52.913
That's right.

10:52.956 --> 10:54.349
I was transferring her
to another prison

10:54.392 --> 10:56.351
when she overpowered me.

10:56.394 --> 10:58.832
Look, I gotta call this in,
get State to set up a perimeter.

10:58.875 --> 10:59.920
We can handle it.

10:59.963 --> 11:01.704
I'm sure you can,
but like I said,

11:01.748 --> 11:03.750
the sooner we apprehend her,
the better.

11:03.793 --> 11:05.403
I know how this looks.

11:05.447 --> 11:07.449
Did she do a lot of working out
after these photos were taken?

11:07.492 --> 11:09.843
What?
Well, she's 125 pounds.

11:09.886 --> 11:11.235
You said
she overpowered you.

11:11.279 --> 11:13.324
And wasn't she in handcuffs?

11:13.368 --> 11:15.675
No.
W-What does it matter?

11:15.718 --> 11:16.850
You just need to find her.

11:16.893 --> 11:18.895
Look, we got an APB out
on Faith and your car.

11:18.939 --> 11:20.244
We'll find her.

11:20.288 --> 11:22.333
Why don't you tell us
what really happened?

11:28.035 --> 11:31.778
We just got to talking,
and one thing led to another.

11:31.821 --> 11:33.301
One thing?

11:34.781 --> 11:36.260
Okay,
she kinda seduced me.

11:36.304 --> 11:37.609
Ah.

11:37.653 --> 11:38.959
Yeah. Yeah,
I can see that.

11:40.874 --> 11:42.658
Go on.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.792
She told me I was handsome
and that I had a nice smile,

11:45.835 --> 11:49.796
and then things sorta
progressed, you might say,

11:49.839 --> 11:53.930
in a sexual direction,
if you get what I'm saying.

11:53.974 --> 11:55.671
Mm.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.369
And then she punched me
in the throat, grabbed my gun,

11:58.413 --> 12:00.067
and took everything
but my undies.

12:00.110 --> 12:02.373
Well, and your badge.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.288
Not right now, Popcorn.

12:04.332 --> 12:05.942
Sorry, it can't wait.

12:05.986 --> 12:08.162
The Jamboree Country Market
on Lyndale just got held up.

12:08.205 --> 12:09.903
Suspect
is a woman prison guard.

12:12.035 --> 12:13.167
Your girlfriend.

12:13.210 --> 12:14.864
Let's go.

12:30.314 --> 12:32.664
Good job.

12:32.708 --> 12:35.102
Mary's waiting for you
right down there.

12:35.145 --> 12:36.756
Go on.

12:38.366 --> 12:39.367
Cassie Dewell. Hey.

12:39.410 --> 12:41.282
What brings you
out here?

12:41.325 --> 12:43.327
I was just on my way
to check out a trailhead.
I'm glad I caught you.

12:43.371 --> 12:44.938
Are you and Kai gonna join us
out at the camp?

12:44.981 --> 12:46.548
We've got law enforcement discount.

12:46.591 --> 12:48.376
-Oh, private investigator?
-Yeah, that, too.

12:48.419 --> 12:50.030
Whatever.

12:50.073 --> 12:51.814
What can I do you for?
Um...

12:51.858 --> 12:54.164
Actually, the family of a
backpacker contacted the office.

12:54.208 --> 12:56.340
They haven't heard from him
in a while. They're worried.

12:56.384 --> 12:57.864
Well, is he missing?
Lost?

12:57.907 --> 12:59.866
You know, it's that time
of the year-- tourist season.

12:59.909 --> 13:02.782
Yeah, we're not sure.
I just said I'd look around.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.566
Well, hundreds of miles
of trail.

13:04.609 --> 13:07.917
People come out here
to get off the grid, get lost.

13:07.961 --> 13:10.833
I know.
This is him.

13:10.877 --> 13:13.009
He's doing the
Continental Divide trail.

13:13.053 --> 13:15.577
His parents said he usually
calls once every other day,

13:15.620 --> 13:17.318
and he hasn't called
in a few days.

13:17.361 --> 13:18.885
That's a long way
from here.

13:18.928 --> 13:20.408
Yeah, it sounds like
he did a detour,

13:20.451 --> 13:21.975
so I figured I'd just
put the word out

13:22.018 --> 13:23.890
to all the outfitters,
you know...

13:23.933 --> 13:26.022
I remember
when my son Cormac

13:26.066 --> 13:29.547
took that crazy bike trip
down to Baja.

13:29.591 --> 13:32.115
I was worried sick
for nights.

13:32.159 --> 13:33.900
Eh, Cormac.

13:33.943 --> 13:35.858
You remember my son, Cormac,
don't you?

13:37.381 --> 13:39.209
Yeah.
Cormac. Cassie.

13:39.253 --> 13:40.297
Hey, Cassie.

13:40.341 --> 13:42.865
Hi.
Everything okay?

13:42.909 --> 13:44.084
Uh, missing backpacker.

13:44.127 --> 13:45.346
Yeah, yeah. Ah.

13:45.389 --> 13:48.044
Here you go.
That's him.

13:48.088 --> 13:50.351
He'll probably turn up,

13:50.394 --> 13:52.875
and if he don't,
bears gotta eat, too.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.398
-Cormac!
-I'm joking.

13:54.442 --> 13:56.879
I don't find that funny.

13:56.923 --> 13:58.881
Sorry.
Our guests don't have to worry.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.317
We, uh, run a tight ship.

14:00.361 --> 14:01.797
Yes, we do.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.931
Well, I appreciate you
keeping an eye out.

14:04.974 --> 14:05.975
I'll see you around.

14:06.019 --> 14:08.195
Hope so. Mm.

14:10.284 --> 14:11.589
"Hope so"?

14:13.765 --> 14:15.202
She's cute.

14:15.245 --> 14:17.117
All right, lover boy,

14:17.160 --> 14:18.422
get the horse
and I'll meet you back at camp.

14:20.468 --> 14:22.252
"Hope so." God.

14:22.296 --> 14:24.298
We heard noise, but we
didn't really see anything.

14:24.341 --> 14:26.039
I didn't see anything.

14:27.997 --> 14:29.303
Shop owner:
The security company called

14:29.346 --> 14:30.913
as soon as
the silent alarm triggered.

14:34.003 --> 14:36.963
Some cash is missing and some
personals, clothes and such.

14:38.225 --> 14:41.402
Classic smash and grab.
Some money for the road.

14:43.317 --> 14:44.927
We need to talk
to whoever was here.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.929
Our manager, Bill Camp,
was on shift,

14:46.973 --> 14:48.409
but he wasn't here
when I arrived.

14:48.452 --> 14:49.801
Now I can't reach him.

14:49.845 --> 14:51.412
Well, maybe he got
spooked and ran.

14:51.455 --> 14:53.370
Well,
one way we can find out.

14:53.414 --> 14:54.937
Are those working?

15:02.118 --> 15:03.554
Hey.
Hey.

15:03.598 --> 15:06.122
Uh, Cormac said Cassie Dewell
was at the put-in.

15:06.166 --> 15:08.516
She was.
What does she want?

15:08.559 --> 15:10.605
She was asking about
a missing backpacker.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.477
Huh.

15:13.521 --> 15:16.002
Probably nothing, but best
we don't tell the guests.

15:16.045 --> 15:18.134
You know, it's bad enough
that that shed hunter

15:18.178 --> 15:20.136
got mauled
by the grizzly last month.

15:20.180 --> 15:21.964
Well, even so,
we need to double down

15:22.008 --> 15:23.879
on that bear aware speech, honey.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.576
Good idea.

20:52.033 --> 20:53.687
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a lot of work to do.

20:53.730 --> 20:55.123
The ranch.
I want to buy it.

21:00.824 --> 21:03.392
No offense, but it's a little
out of your price range.

21:03.436 --> 21:05.873
My father left me some money.
That ranch was his dream.

21:05.916 --> 21:07.483
I want to buy it.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.572
I already have numerous offers.
All cash.

21:09.616 --> 21:11.444
All over asking.
Really?

21:11.487 --> 21:14.708
And do these people know about
the drug lab in the basement?

21:14.751 --> 21:18.581
Or the murders?
Because I could tell them.

21:18.625 --> 21:21.236
As a licensed broker, you're
bound to make disclosures.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.585
It would be interesting,
wouldn't it,

21:22.629 --> 21:24.195
given your involvement.

21:24.239 --> 21:27.024
And there it is.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.289
That's a shame.

21:30.332 --> 21:33.553
Here I was, gonna treat you
to a piece of Donno's pie.

21:33.596 --> 21:35.468
Strawberry rhubarb.

21:35.511 --> 21:38.427
My grandmother's recipe.
She died in the bath.

21:38.471 --> 21:40.647
Yeah, I'm gonna
send you an offer.

21:40.690 --> 21:42.692
It'll be a fair one.

21:42.736 --> 21:44.564
If I was you,
I would take it.

21:53.399 --> 21:55.096
Hey.
Hey.

21:55.139 --> 21:57.968
The hostage Faith grabbed
wasn't just some random guy.

21:58.012 --> 21:59.405
Lay it on me, 'cause
I've been wondering why

21:59.448 --> 22:00.406
somebody who
broke out of prison

22:00.449 --> 22:02.582
had a pocket full
of stolen cash

22:02.625 --> 22:05.498
would have taken
a store manager hostage.

22:05.541 --> 22:06.542
The manager,
William Camp,

22:06.586 --> 22:08.501
is the brother
of her ex-boyfriend,

22:08.544 --> 22:10.590
who she blames
for her conviction.

22:10.633 --> 22:11.895
Revenge?

22:11.939 --> 22:13.984
Solid motive.
I like it.
Yep, me, too.

22:14.028 --> 22:15.421
Yeah,
I don't know about that.

22:15.464 --> 22:17.553
Faith Cole's ex-boyfriend
is in prison.

22:17.597 --> 22:19.425
Got picked up for stealing
a thresher six months ago.

22:19.468 --> 22:21.209
Hmm. Well, there goes
our revenge theory.

22:21.252 --> 22:22.515
Not necessarily.

22:22.558 --> 22:24.430
Who steals a thresher, honestly?

22:24.473 --> 22:26.910
I stole a riding mower once,
back in my, uh, wild days.

22:26.954 --> 22:29.043
Of course you did,
you rebel.

22:29.086 --> 22:31.393
Anything else in her past
seem hinky?

22:31.437 --> 22:33.613
Not really.
She's single, no kids,

22:33.656 --> 22:35.179
both parents deceased,
and no siblings.

22:35.223 --> 22:37.399
Hmm. What about the hostage?
Do we have an address on him?

22:37.443 --> 22:38.879
Maybe there's something
there we're not seeing.

22:38.922 --> 22:40.533
Did you put a BOLO
out on the car?

22:40.576 --> 22:42.622
-Yes, sir.
-What'd I say
about calling me sir?

22:42.665 --> 22:44.406
Sorry, sir.
Uh, damn.

22:44.450 --> 22:45.842
Um, I mean Beau.

22:45.886 --> 22:48.192
I gotta--
got to lock that in.

22:48.236 --> 22:51.195
Uh, and yes, I have an address
for the store manager.

22:52.893 --> 22:53.981
Help him.

22:55.330 --> 22:56.897
Stop with
the sucking up.

22:56.940 --> 22:58.768
Got it.

23:01.118 --> 23:02.903
Hey.
Hey.

23:02.946 --> 23:04.687
So far, we've got Sunny Barnes
checking out the trailheads.

23:04.731 --> 23:06.341
No sign of his car,

23:06.385 --> 23:08.212
so I hope you had better luck
than I did today.

23:08.256 --> 23:11.128
Well, actually...
it's probably nothing, or...

23:11.172 --> 23:12.826
Wait, no.
Let me see it.

23:12.869 --> 23:14.610
Well, the name
of that trailhead--

23:14.654 --> 23:16.569
Basin Trail-- I just couldn't
shake the feeling

23:16.612 --> 23:19.267
that I heard it before, and Lord
knows I'm not a hiker,

23:19.310 --> 23:21.574
and then
it finally hit me.

23:21.617 --> 23:24.185
Years ago, my neighbor's son's
girlfriend disappeared,

23:24.228 --> 23:25.708
and that's where
it happened.

23:25.752 --> 23:27.623
Apparently, it was
at this trailhead

23:27.667 --> 23:31.714
that they went to some kind
of prom night afterparty.

23:31.758 --> 23:33.150
I'll never forget it.

23:33.194 --> 23:35.805
The entire police department
just swarming my block

23:35.849 --> 23:38.242
while this kid
just sat there on the curb

23:38.286 --> 23:40.593
crying in
his ill-fitted tux.

23:40.636 --> 23:42.551
Was she found?
Mm-hmm.

23:43.596 --> 23:45.424
She was mutilated.

23:45.467 --> 23:47.948
And it wasn't a bear.

23:47.991 --> 23:50.516
Her heart
had been cut out.

23:50.559 --> 23:51.821
Jesus.

23:51.865 --> 23:53.475
Yeah.

23:53.519 --> 23:54.694
Do you think
there's a connection?

23:54.737 --> 23:56.130
I-I don't know.

23:56.173 --> 23:58.175
These two events
are 20 years apart.

23:58.219 --> 24:00.003
The location's
the only unifying detail.

24:00.047 --> 24:02.005
Right now, all we know
is this backpacker,

24:02.049 --> 24:03.790
he hasn't checked in,
there's no cell service.

24:03.833 --> 24:05.269
I don't want to jump
to any conclusions.

24:05.313 --> 24:07.010
Yep, yep.
I thought it was a stretch.

24:07.054 --> 24:08.403
Well, I mean,
throw it up on the board.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.840
You never know.

24:10.884 --> 24:13.234
Hey, we still on
for movie night?

24:13.277 --> 24:16.672
Well, uh, my day's gone
a bit sideways,

24:16.716 --> 24:18.065
but I'm hoping Hoyt and I
can wrap it up,

24:18.108 --> 24:19.501
and we'll be
back on schedule.

24:19.545 --> 24:20.850
Ooh.
Dare I ask?

24:20.894 --> 24:22.678
<i>
Chasing a fugitive,</i>

24:22.722 --> 24:24.593
hostage situation--
a whole bunch of other things

24:24.637 --> 24:26.247
I did not have
on my bingo card.

24:26.290 --> 24:28.205
<i>Wow, uh,
you weren't kidding.</i>

24:28.249 --> 24:29.511
Yeah.

24:29.555 --> 24:30.773
I'll keep you posted,
all right?

24:30.817 --> 24:32.209
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

24:35.169 --> 24:36.518
What?

24:36.562 --> 24:38.825
Nothing.

24:38.868 --> 24:41.567
Is it weird for you
that I'm friends with Cassie?

24:41.610 --> 24:45.484
Are you <i>really</i> friends, or...

24:45.527 --> 24:47.529
Yes.

24:47.573 --> 24:49.444
Yes. Yes.
We're just friends.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.533
Look, you know, we bonded over
the past couple of months.

24:52.708 --> 24:54.667
But if you're feeling
a little left out,

24:54.710 --> 24:56.059
consider yourself invited.

24:56.103 --> 24:58.540
No, no, no, no. I'm good.
I don't want to intrude.

24:58.584 --> 25:01.456
It's a movie night--
some snacks, we get some beers,

25:01.500 --> 25:03.110
then we mix it up.

25:03.153 --> 25:06.374
We watch some classics,
Korean horror.
Oh, God.

25:06.417 --> 25:08.507
'80s rom-coms.
Huge Cusack fan.

25:08.550 --> 25:09.856
Eh...
Yeah.

25:14.164 --> 25:18.342
<i>♪ All the thoughts that drift
within my dreams♪</i>

25:18.386 --> 25:20.693
I think it's down
at the end.

25:20.736 --> 25:23.783
<i>♪ Our endless lost highway♪</i>

25:23.826 --> 25:25.393
Oh!

25:30.616 --> 25:32.139
Is that the hostage?

25:33.140 --> 25:34.533
It sure is.

25:34.576 --> 25:35.708
He's still alive.
Call an ambulance.

25:35.751 --> 25:38.058
Bill? Hey, Bill?
Can you hear me?

25:38.101 --> 25:40.190
Bill!

25:45.282 --> 25:47.328
Come on, Bill.
Stay with me, pal.

25:47.371 --> 25:48.895
Paramedics
are on the way.

25:48.938 --> 25:50.374
Stay with me.

25:51.332 --> 25:52.768
-I'm going up.
-Hoyt, where you going?

25:52.812 --> 25:53.769
You need backup!

27:22.031 --> 27:25.426
The apartment's empty.
No sign of Faith anywhere.

27:25.469 --> 27:26.862
Is he okay?
W-- Okay.
Well, that's good,

27:26.906 --> 27:28.516
'cause you went in there
without any backup.

27:28.559 --> 27:29.952
Do you have any
police training whatsoever?

27:29.996 --> 27:31.824
If she pushed him out
the window, she can't be far.

27:33.956 --> 27:35.218
All right, I'll get
every available unit

27:35.262 --> 27:36.742
to search the area, okay?

27:36.785 --> 27:38.091
Thank you.

27:38.134 --> 27:39.396
What the hell's that?

27:39.440 --> 27:41.616
She stole this
from the market.

27:41.660 --> 27:42.704
Why?

27:42.748 --> 27:44.967
I dunno.

27:45.011 --> 27:46.229
I used to have something
like this when I was a kid,

27:46.273 --> 27:47.535
till my brother
ripped its head off,

27:47.578 --> 27:49.189
and then I put him
in a headlock,

27:49.232 --> 27:50.712
and Mom beat the crap
out of both of us. Okay.

27:50.756 --> 27:52.975
What if this whole thing
is about a kid?

27:53.019 --> 27:54.673
I'm listening.

27:54.716 --> 27:57.893
I found clothes and stuff
belonging to a child, a girl.

27:57.937 --> 27:59.460
Okay,
so Bill's got a daughter.

27:59.503 --> 28:01.288
Why would Faith
have interest in that?

28:01.331 --> 28:03.986
I don't know, but what
if she grabbed her?

28:09.122 --> 28:11.690
Will you please
slow down?

28:11.733 --> 28:14.257
I thought you wanted
to get a workout in.

28:14.301 --> 28:17.913
Listen, you can keep doing your
passive aggressive fitness thing

28:17.957 --> 28:19.741
while we don't talk
about why we're here,

28:19.785 --> 28:23.832
or we can just... maybe
have some fun.

28:25.442 --> 28:26.966
And if you don't want to do
that, you can go.

28:27.009 --> 28:30.186
Really.
I'll have fun without you.

28:30.230 --> 28:31.971
I'm sure you will.

28:32.014 --> 28:33.973
I saw you looking at
that other guy.

28:34.016 --> 28:35.017
Yeah.

28:35.061 --> 28:36.932
The cowboy.

28:36.976 --> 28:39.152
Cormac?
Sunny's son?

28:39.195 --> 28:41.197
Come on, you were
checking him out.

28:46.072 --> 28:47.073
Maybe.

28:47.116 --> 28:48.378
A little.

28:50.337 --> 28:52.165
I knew it.

28:59.912 --> 29:03.785
Luke, please stop.

29:03.829 --> 29:04.830
I need to take a break.

29:09.704 --> 29:11.445
Weird.

29:11.488 --> 29:13.447
Is that blood?

29:13.490 --> 29:15.623
Paint.

29:15.666 --> 29:16.972
I hope.

29:18.844 --> 29:20.584
That's gross.

29:20.628 --> 29:21.977
Let's go.

29:25.067 --> 29:27.069
Mighty big knife there, girl.

29:29.028 --> 29:30.943
My father gave it to me.

29:30.986 --> 29:32.640
He sounds like
a good father.

29:34.729 --> 29:36.165
Best not to spy.

29:37.297 --> 29:39.995
It's for this podcast
that I'm doing.

29:40.039 --> 29:41.780
Podcast?

29:41.823 --> 29:43.520
Still searching
for a theme.

29:43.564 --> 29:46.828
I'm thinking maybe
secrets and lies--

29:46.872 --> 29:47.829
Relationships.

29:47.873 --> 29:49.222
Sounds interesting.

29:49.265 --> 29:50.919
Well,
I could interview you.

29:50.963 --> 29:53.792
Well, you could, but what
you see is what you get.

29:53.835 --> 29:56.142
I don't believe that.

29:56.185 --> 29:57.883
Come on, let's give them
some privacy.

29:57.926 --> 29:59.188
You can help me
start the fire.

29:59.232 --> 30:00.233
Come on.

30:10.721 --> 30:12.506
Here we go.

30:12.549 --> 30:13.986
Talk to me, Papa Smurf.

30:14.029 --> 30:16.510
So, the hostage, Bill Camp,
did not have any kids.

30:16.553 --> 30:17.554
Okay.

30:17.598 --> 30:18.947
<i>But his brother did.</i>

30:18.991 --> 30:20.557
Faith's ex.
Girl's name's Madelyn.

30:20.601 --> 30:22.733
Her mother died
of a drug overdose.

30:22.777 --> 30:24.605
Did Faith help raise the kid? <i>Looks like that.</i>

30:24.648 --> 30:26.781
Even stayed in her life
after she and the ex broke up.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.522
The ex went to prison
six months ago,

30:28.565 --> 30:31.003
which means Uncle Bill
could've got custody of the kid.

30:31.046 --> 30:32.656
<i>Yeppers.
You got it, boss.</i>

30:32.700 --> 30:34.658
We found a letter from the girl
in Faith's prison cell.

30:34.702 --> 30:36.312
She said she's moving
with Uncle Bill

30:36.356 --> 30:38.749
and the aunt to Ireland
in two weeks for his new job.

30:38.793 --> 30:40.316
In the letter,
she called Faith "Mommy".

30:40.360 --> 30:41.840
That's why she
had to break out.

30:41.883 --> 30:43.102
She couldn't wait
to be released on parole.

30:43.145 --> 30:44.581
You just read my mind.

30:44.625 --> 30:46.714
How do we know the kid's
not with her aunt right now?

30:46.757 --> 30:48.411
Been trying her cellphone,
but no luck.

30:48.455 --> 30:50.326
No answer at work, either.

30:50.370 --> 30:53.199
Where does she work? <i>At a salon.
Helena Hair Designs.</i>

30:53.242 --> 30:55.070
Shoot us an address, Potpie.
Nice work.

30:57.159 --> 30:58.769
I got it.

31:00.336 --> 31:04.079
If she thinks she can
take that kid and run... mnh-mnh.

31:04.123 --> 31:05.515
She's desperate.

31:05.559 --> 31:06.995
She thinks she's a mother.

31:23.185 --> 31:25.405
Where is she?!

31:25.448 --> 31:26.972
I told you,

31:27.015 --> 31:29.626
she's away
on a school trip.

31:33.195 --> 31:35.589
Maddy?! It's Mommy.

31:35.632 --> 31:38.374
Hi, sweetheart.

31:38.418 --> 31:40.028
Oh.

31:40.072 --> 31:42.944
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

31:42.988 --> 31:45.207
I missed you.

31:45.251 --> 31:46.992
Put the gun down!

31:47.035 --> 31:49.081
Drop the gun!
Put it on the ground, now!

31:49.124 --> 31:51.648
Faith! Faith,
you don't want to do this.

31:51.692 --> 31:55.000
I already lost her once.
I won't lose her again.

31:55.043 --> 31:57.263
Don't do this to Maddy.
Don't make her witness this.

32:00.309 --> 32:01.963
Come on. We don't
want to shoot you.

32:03.312 --> 32:07.012
Maddy. Maddy, honey,
I need you to step away.

32:07.055 --> 32:09.014
No.

32:09.057 --> 32:11.494
Faith, listen to me,
put the gun down.

32:11.538 --> 32:13.061
Do it for Maddy.

32:13.105 --> 32:14.976
You can do this.

32:27.249 --> 32:28.685
Okay. Let's go.

32:28.729 --> 32:30.644
-Let's go.
-No. No. No.

32:30.687 --> 32:31.775
No!

32:32.951 --> 32:34.213
Hoyt.

32:34.256 --> 32:35.649
Wait.

32:35.692 --> 32:37.085
Give her a minute.

32:37.129 --> 32:38.565
Let her say goodbye
to her kid.

32:46.921 --> 32:48.662
What could it hurt?

32:48.705 --> 32:50.490
She's going away for life.

32:59.281 --> 33:02.328
Your [sighs] offer

33:02.371 --> 33:05.853
is lower than the others
I've received.

33:05.896 --> 33:07.159
It's the right offer, Tonya.

33:11.119 --> 33:12.599
I'm accepting.

33:12.642 --> 33:15.210
For old times' sake.

33:17.212 --> 33:19.432
Wait, what--
what's the catch?

33:19.475 --> 33:21.260
No catch.

33:21.303 --> 33:23.349
I'm surprised you waived
the contingencies,

33:23.392 --> 33:25.046
but I think you'll be
happy with the changes.

33:25.090 --> 33:27.048
The new kitchen
is fabulous.

33:27.092 --> 33:29.224
What about the basement?

33:29.268 --> 33:31.183
Laundry room and storage.

33:31.226 --> 33:33.707
But hey, maybe you could
make it into a home theater

33:33.750 --> 33:34.925
if you wanted to splurge.

33:34.969 --> 33:36.449
I think I'm good.

33:40.757 --> 33:42.759
I hope to get an invitation
to the housewarming.

33:42.803 --> 33:43.891
Oh.

33:44.892 --> 33:46.198
Don't hold your breath.

33:59.254 --> 34:01.387
We prepare dinner
as a group.

34:01.430 --> 34:04.172
Where's that good-looking
boyfriend of yours?

34:04.216 --> 34:06.392
Um, I am not sure.

34:06.435 --> 34:07.915
Probably still
sulking somewhere

34:07.958 --> 34:09.917
because we're not poolside
at a resort.

34:09.960 --> 34:13.007
Hm.
Oh, he'll come around.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.574
But if he doesn't,
we could always leave him

34:14.617 --> 34:16.271
for a couple days
in the woods.

34:16.315 --> 34:18.056
Don't tempt me.

34:18.099 --> 34:19.709
Been there.

34:21.189 --> 34:23.409
But I got me
a good one now.

34:23.452 --> 34:25.367
Comes when he's called.

34:25.411 --> 34:27.152
Still gives me that look,

34:27.195 --> 34:28.892
and gentle.

34:28.936 --> 34:30.372
He's a gentle man.

34:30.416 --> 34:32.461
♪ We've both abandoned
the reason ♪

34:32.505 --> 34:35.203
Luke's not so bad.

34:35.247 --> 34:38.076
He just needs a little training,
that's all.

34:38.119 --> 34:39.990
Yeah.

34:40.034 --> 34:41.644
Why don't you go find him
while I warm up

34:41.688 --> 34:43.037
my "Happy Birthday"
voice?

34:43.081 --> 34:44.256
He's gonna hate that.

34:44.299 --> 34:46.258
Then I'll make sure
I sing every verse.

34:47.389 --> 34:49.696
Feel free to join in.

35:09.846 --> 35:12.719

35:29.344 --> 35:31.303
Come on.

35:31.346 --> 35:33.609

35:34.828 --> 35:36.438
Plus,
if you don't cheer up,

35:36.482 --> 35:39.398
I won't give you
my present.

35:40.616 --> 35:41.661
Oh, yeah?

35:41.704 --> 35:42.792
Mm-hmm.

35:44.316 --> 35:45.404
What's that?

35:47.449 --> 35:49.408
I'm gonna
take all your clothes off,

35:49.451 --> 35:51.192
and you and I

36:02.116 --> 36:03.813
Yeah,
it's probably nothing.

36:03.857 --> 36:05.859
Yeah, hey,
don't worry about it.

36:05.902 --> 36:07.034
Come here.

36:08.340 --> 36:10.255
Uh!

36:10.298 --> 36:12.213
Ugh!

36:24.965 --> 36:28.011
Well, looks like it got mauled
and ran till it collapsed,

36:28.055 --> 36:30.840
or sometimes predators
run their...

36:30.884 --> 36:32.407
prey right off a cliff.

36:32.451 --> 36:35.454
Just nature.

36:35.497 --> 36:36.846
Cycle of life.

36:36.890 --> 36:38.370
You were right.

36:38.413 --> 36:39.632
We should have gone
anywhere but here.

36:39.675 --> 36:41.286
I wanna leave now.

36:41.329 --> 36:43.723
Oh, come on, honey.
Give it another chance.

36:43.766 --> 36:45.290
You're not scared by this,
are ya?

36:45.333 --> 36:48.162
Look, maybe she's right.

36:48.206 --> 36:50.773
I mean, I gotta say,
this is way more exciting

36:50.817 --> 36:52.210
than sitting by the pool
getting drunk.

36:53.472 --> 36:54.560
Are you serious?

36:54.603 --> 36:56.344
Well, yeah.
I mean, think about it.

36:56.388 --> 36:58.303
There's blood on your hands.
There's a dead coyote.

36:58.346 --> 36:59.956
It's the woods.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.394
It's gonna be such a good story
when we go home.

37:03.438 --> 37:06.441
Please?

37:06.485 --> 37:07.790
Fine.

37:16.364 --> 37:18.845
Um, even though you've never
given me a real glass,

37:18.888 --> 37:20.455
this place is really,
um--

37:20.499 --> 37:21.804
really starting... Making fun of my glassware.

37:21.848 --> 37:23.545
Making fun of it....to grow on me.

37:23.589 --> 37:27.201
Well, listen, once, uh, you
know, you move into your ranch,

37:27.245 --> 37:28.811
we're gonna have to do
movie nights there, okay?

37:28.855 --> 37:30.117
We'll see.
Oh, yeah.

37:30.160 --> 37:32.075
-Oh, you think so? Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

37:38.604 --> 37:40.432
Oh, I'm flexible. Yep.

37:40.475 --> 37:41.781

Ryan Gosling's in it.

37:41.824 --> 37:43.565

Cheers.
Now, hang on.
Don't I get a vote?

37:45.567 --> 37:46.612
You get a vote.

37:46.655 --> 37:48.614
We get two votes
because we're two people.

37:48.657 --> 37:50.485
Oh. Okay.
I see where this is going.

37:50.529 --> 37:52.052

my missing backpacker case.

39:23.273 --> 39:24.710
No, Sunny's great,

what to do with that.

she means to you.
