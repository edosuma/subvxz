01:20.194 --> 01:22.276
Aloha, foolish mortals!

01:22.277 --> 01:25.193
You have come upon
the gates of hell.

01:25.194 --> 01:28.609
Prepare to meet your fiery fate
in an orderly fashion.

01:28.610 --> 01:30.318
Three lines, please.

01:30.319 --> 01:32.568
Boo.

01:32.569 --> 01:37.234
Come inside the gates where we
have no used condoms to step on.

01:37.235 --> 01:38.943
What about you, guy texting?

01:38.944 --> 01:41.484
Why don't you text
the rest of your boy band

01:41.485 --> 01:43.360
to come down to hell?

01:44.777 --> 01:46.526
Anyone? Any takers?

01:46.527 --> 01:48.234
That was pathetic!

01:48.235 --> 01:51.318
You don't know the first thing
about carnival barking.

01:51.319 --> 01:53.151
Time for school, son.

01:53.152 --> 01:55.568
Hear ye, hear ye!

01:55.569 --> 02:00.859
Repent now, foolish mortal, for
ye enter now the gates of hell!

02:00.860 --> 02:03.651
That is how that's done.
Enthusiasm, bro.

02:03.652 --> 02:06.568
And always throw the horns.
Always!

02:06.569 --> 02:09.234
Yeah, man, 'cause there's
nothing depressing

02:09.235 --> 02:11.151
about old metalheads
still throwing up horns.

02:11.152 --> 02:13.693
Listen here, skinny jeans
fucknose.

02:13.694 --> 02:17.026
This place can't survive forever
without customers.

02:17.027 --> 02:19.109
No customers, no money.

02:19.110 --> 02:21.151
No money, no park.

02:21.152 --> 02:23.193
No park, no park.

02:23.194 --> 02:25.901
"No park, no park." What are
you, a valet at P.F. Chang?

02:25.902 --> 02:27.943
You do know that you just
repeated yourself, right?

02:27.944 --> 02:30.443
Or did you get pummeled
with so many leather dildos

02:30.444 --> 02:32.776
at a Judas priest concert that you have
no idea what you're saying right now?

02:32.777 --> 02:35.234
Listen, it would be an honor
to be fucked by Judas priest.

02:35.235 --> 02:40.651
You don't know shit about dick
or rock or roll.

02:40.652 --> 02:43.901
- Get that lubtard to fix this shit.
- I'll tell him.

02:43.902 --> 02:46.943
You can also tell him that he
looks like a prime candidate

02:46.944 --> 02:49.651
for type 2 diabetes.

02:49.652 --> 02:53.151
So funny, Cleb. You know, I hear
you talking about my friend,

02:53.152 --> 02:56.651
but it looks like the words
are coming out of a dog-shit snowman.

02:56.652 --> 02:57.527
Hey, man...

02:57.528 --> 02:59.526
Do you have a time machine
so I can go back in time

02:59.527 --> 03:02.068
and punch your mom in the stomach
so you don't grow up to be you?

03:02.069 --> 03:04.401
Uh... uh... bitch-head.

03:04.402 --> 03:07.443
Augie! The ride's broken again.

03:07.444 --> 03:11.151
I'll punch your dick off
with my mouth, bro.

03:11.152 --> 03:14.444
Okay, red is the relay
and white is the ground.

03:20.402 --> 03:24.818
I'm sorry! I just shorted out
part of my body.

03:24.819 --> 03:27.069
It's very dark in here.

03:30.402 --> 03:33.859
Just let me get a flashlight,
and then I'll...

03:33.860 --> 03:36.193
Okay, so I'll just need
to check the...

03:36.194 --> 03:40.652
Hello? Madame Zonar?

03:42.610 --> 03:45.818
Tell me, do you believe
in destiny?

03:45.819 --> 03:48.069
Why? Should I?

03:50.235 --> 03:52.151
Do you believe
that your heart will stop

03:52.152 --> 03:54.359
because of all the fat
that has collected around it

03:54.360 --> 03:58.193
from the junk food and garbage
that you eat?

03:58.194 --> 03:59.901
I can only imagine
that your veins

03:59.902 --> 04:03.401
are filled with grease and tacos
and Cheetos.

04:03.402 --> 04:05.276
Do you believe in this destiny?

04:05.277 --> 04:06.819
Well, I mean, I...

04:07.902 --> 04:09.776
Mr. fat, fat, Fattykins.

04:09.777 --> 04:12.944
Okay, I just need to find
your breakers.

04:14.319 --> 04:17.233
It's true that I smother
my sadness with Carbs.

04:17.235 --> 04:20.402
It's my private shame.

04:23.277 --> 04:26.943
Shit! Ow...

04:26.944 --> 04:29.984
I sense that you are good
with your hands.

04:29.985 --> 04:33.109
- Thanks, thanks.
- Please, sit down.

04:33.110 --> 04:35.193
You are talented, young one.

04:35.194 --> 04:38.443
But you spend too much time
fucking your hand.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.234
- What? How did you...?
- Yes.

04:40.235 --> 04:43.609
And your hand doesn't enjoy it.
It's not consensual.

04:43.610 --> 04:45.234
No. Now, that's not true at all.
That's...

04:45.235 --> 04:46.984
So, basically,
you're raping your own hand.

04:46.985 --> 04:49.526
No. -And that is why
nobody loves you.

04:49.527 --> 04:52.944
- You're way off.
- Nobody will ever love you.

04:54.735 --> 04:56.484
Augie, what are you doing?

04:56.485 --> 04:58.568
Please, sit down.

04:58.569 --> 05:02.276
Madame Zonar, dreamer of desires,
senses a need within you.

05:02.277 --> 05:04.193
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I work here.

05:04.194 --> 05:06.234
Can you not talk like that?
You're an adult on planet earth.

05:06.235 --> 05:08.859
Well, maybe if you put a circuit
breaker on my crystal ball,

05:08.860 --> 05:10.484
I could do my job here.

05:10.485 --> 05:12.234
Yeah, we got to get
this whole place in shape

05:12.235 --> 05:13.901
or we're all gonna be out
of jobs, okay?

05:13.902 --> 05:15.859
You could use
some shaping up yourself.

05:15.860 --> 05:19.401
I know I may be old and wrinkly,
but my power can provide.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.984
- Oh, really?
- So can my vagina.

05:21.985 --> 05:24.484
Not my breasts so much.
They've been used and abused.

05:24.485 --> 05:27.151
You know what? I take one look at you
and my dick hops out of my pants,

05:27.152 --> 05:31.526
goes and gets a gun, and blows
the head of its own dick off.

05:31.527 --> 05:35.235
That is not the first time
I have been told that by a man.

05:39.235 --> 05:41.943
Bro, I saw the way
you were looking at her.

05:41.944 --> 05:43.693
Wait, what?

05:43.694 --> 05:45.984
Thinkin' about throwin' madame
boner a part of your baby dick?

05:45.985 --> 05:47.901
Remy, that's fucked up, dude.
No way.

05:47.902 --> 05:49.818
Come on, Augie,
you need the experience.

05:49.819 --> 05:51.609
And she rubs balls for a living.

05:51.610 --> 05:53.318
And they're crystal,
so at least she'll be careful,

05:53.319 --> 05:55.151
but she's like
a thousand years old.

05:55.152 --> 05:57.943
I mean, she must be like
a sandpaper factory down there.

05:57.944 --> 05:59.693
Dude, don't knock sandpaper.

05:59.694 --> 06:01.526
My cat licked my penis
when I was in sixth grade,

06:01.527 --> 06:02.819
and I still think about it.

06:04.902 --> 06:06.776
Not again.

06:06.777 --> 06:09.151
- We got to put this horse down.
- Dude, this place is in trouble.

06:09.152 --> 06:12.193
The gates of hell's our main
attraction, and it's falling to shit.

06:12.194 --> 06:13.776
Yeah, I know.

06:13.777 --> 06:16.109
Well, you're the handyman,
Augie. So, fix it.

06:16.110 --> 06:18.776
No, no, no, no, I would, but Cleb
told me there's no money to fix it.

06:18.777 --> 06:21.318
- Ouch! Hey!
- Sorry.

06:21.319 --> 06:22.443
Ouch!

06:22.444 --> 06:23.609
Did you ask curt for the money?

06:23.610 --> 06:25.151
No, no, no, 'cause he's...

06:25.152 --> 06:26.359
The assistant manager!

06:26.360 --> 06:28.026
Cleb's the manager.

06:28.027 --> 06:30.318
His name is Cleb.
I mean, imagine his parents.

06:30.319 --> 06:32.068
Yeah, it does feel like
they gave up

06:32.069 --> 06:34.526
just as soon as they started
choosing baby names.

06:34.527 --> 06:37.943
Hot fuck action to the Max

06:37.944 --> 06:40.318
that's what I like, fuck action

06:40.319 --> 06:43.318
clockin' out.

06:43.319 --> 06:45.734
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You're seriously leaving early?

06:45.735 --> 06:49.443
That's right, got a hot date
tonight with madame Zonar.

06:49.444 --> 06:51.401
Oh, you mean the fortune teller?

06:51.402 --> 06:53.568
I'm pretty sure
I saw her on deck today

06:53.569 --> 06:55.734
slipping around in what appeared
to be her own vomit

06:55.735 --> 06:58.984
as she was trying to poo
off the side of her boat.

06:58.985 --> 07:01.401
That's my lady.

07:01.402 --> 07:04.109
Well, not to be a dick, my friend,
just pointing out the obvious here.

07:04.110 --> 07:05.984
You don't really have any skill sets.
Yeah.

07:05.985 --> 07:07.984
And then, you know, you smoke
a tremendous amount of weed.

07:07.985 --> 07:09.776
- Right.
- And you spend all your time...

07:09.777 --> 07:11.984
talking to alcoholic,
mentally ill fortune tellers.

07:11.985 --> 07:13.651
That's me.

07:13.652 --> 07:15.484
All while the rides are
in dangerously bad condition.

07:15.485 --> 07:18.359
Whoa! I told Remy
to tell Augie to fix them.

07:18.360 --> 07:20.609
That buck has been passed.

07:20.610 --> 07:22.443
Well, yeah, right,

07:22.444 --> 07:24.734
but still, I mean, one of us
has to maintain a safe park.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.901
You know, so our customers
don't die on the rides.

07:26.902 --> 07:31.776
Well, I guess we got to figure out
who's gonna do that. You or me?

07:31.777 --> 07:35.984
Well, since
you're the manager...

07:35.985 --> 07:37.818
Four-20.

07:37.819 --> 07:40.026
- See you tomorrow.
- Awesome.

07:40.027 --> 07:43.026
All right, thank you so much
for all the stuff you do, Cleb.

07:43.027 --> 07:45.402
Whatever that is, bud.

07:48.027 --> 07:50.151
Jab, jab, jab, jab.

07:50.152 --> 07:51.526
You're going down!

07:51.527 --> 07:54.984
- Watch out now!
- Oh, shit.

07:54.985 --> 07:58.734
So, dude, after break we need you
to order some parts for the gates.

07:58.735 --> 08:00.568
Not this time. The park is done.

08:00.569 --> 08:02.485
- What?
- What?

08:03.569 --> 08:06.026
The park is done? Bullshit!

08:06.027 --> 08:09.318
We just got a letter from
the bank. The place is bankrupt.

08:09.319 --> 08:11.318
- Bankrupt?
- How could you let this happen?

08:11.319 --> 08:14.068
Me?
This place is a dinosaur, man!

08:14.069 --> 08:17.151
Other parks have roller coasters
that rearrange your organs.

08:17.152 --> 08:21.151
We got a squirt gun balloon race
and a needle exchange program.

08:21.152 --> 08:24.443
Curt, remember the three of us
were gonna bro-out here forever?

08:24.444 --> 08:27.151
I don't know what to tell ya.
Maybe I'll go to college.

08:27.152 --> 08:29.318
Oh, really, bro? Awesome, man!

08:29.319 --> 08:31.359
- Yeah, just go to college, dude.
- Come on.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.443
What, are you gonna major
in roofies

08:33.443 --> 08:36.609
with a minor of
"let's get the fuck outta here"?

08:36.610 --> 08:38.693
I'm sorry you don't have
a fallback plan, Remy.

08:38.693 --> 08:41.193
Maybe you should go ask that
fortune teller, madame Zonar,

08:41.193 --> 08:43.318
for some career advice.

08:43.318 --> 08:45.859
Let's go see if the bearded lady
will give you a Beej.

08:45.860 --> 08:47.860
I'll go get the chloroform.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.401
- Curt, steal that clown's knife.
- -Yeah!

08:58.402 --> 09:00.568
We should carve our names
in the pier,

09:00.569 --> 09:02.568
and after high school, if we're
still hanging out at this park,

09:02.569 --> 09:05.360
we'll all slit our wrist
with that knife!

09:14.360 --> 09:17.943
The fool again?
Did I shuffle these?

09:17.944 --> 09:20.651
Ahh.

09:20.652 --> 09:22.859
You were expected.

09:22.860 --> 09:24.443
You knew I was gonna come?

09:24.444 --> 09:26.193
I am Zonar. I know all.

09:26.194 --> 09:29.859
Wow.
What am I thinking right now?

09:29.860 --> 09:33.943
I sense you are haunted by
the dark underlords of the sea.

09:33.944 --> 09:35.443
Ha! Not even close.

09:35.444 --> 09:37.234
I was thinking
about sucking my own dick

09:37.235 --> 09:39.109
in front of my family on Easter.

09:39.110 --> 09:43.069
That is not the first time
I have been told that by a man.

09:44.694 --> 09:46.693
Ah, where was I?

09:46.694 --> 09:50.234
'Tis the sad fate of the cynic to
miss the offerings of the spirits.

09:50.235 --> 09:54.901
The power is within you, child,
should you choose to look for a sign.

09:54.902 --> 09:58.652
Look for a sign.
Really? It's that simple?

10:01.735 --> 10:03.359
What?

10:03.360 --> 10:07.777
"The book of Beelzebub."

10:09.527 --> 10:11.526
Is the devil crying?

10:11.527 --> 10:14.026
- Wow!
- What is it?

10:14.027 --> 10:16.151
Oh, I was just wondering
where you got this book.

10:16.152 --> 10:19.901
A spirit bequeathed it as
an offering from the dark lord.

10:19.902 --> 10:22.526
A dark lord queefed it on you?
What does that mean?

10:22.527 --> 10:25.734
- Can I borrow it?
- No, this isn't a library.

10:25.735 --> 10:32.359
I know, it's a lez-brary
filled with creepy old ladies.

10:32.360 --> 10:36.651
Don't worry, look into the future.
You'll see me returning this book.

10:36.652 --> 10:37.734
Remy!

10:37.735 --> 10:39.609
Remy!

10:39.610 --> 10:42.109
- Remy!
- Remy!

10:42.110 --> 10:45.776
- Whoa!
- Hey, buddy. What's up?

10:45.777 --> 10:47.109
You don't look so good, man.

10:47.110 --> 10:49.568
- Guys, check it out!
- What's that?

10:49.569 --> 10:53.943
That is the "book of Beelzebub,"
the key to saving the park.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.609
- Wait, what?
- Dude, I don't get it.

10:55.610 --> 10:57.818
Look, people travel
across the world

10:57.819 --> 11:00.401
to see the face of Jesus
on a tortilla, right?

11:00.402 --> 11:02.984
Well, the same people
will come to the park in droves

11:02.985 --> 11:06.734
to see Jesus's enemy
cry like a pussy.

11:06.735 --> 11:08.484
Still ain't gonna save the park.

11:08.485 --> 11:11.984
Come on, curt. Doesn't this park
mean anything to you anymore?

11:11.985 --> 11:13.818
Honestly, not really.

11:13.819 --> 11:16.193
Curt, you lost your virginity
right there on this ride.

11:16.194 --> 11:19.234
Augie tried to lose his virginity
there with the strongman.

11:19.235 --> 11:21.734
That's why you should care
about this place, man.

11:21.735 --> 11:22.943
Whatever.

11:22.944 --> 11:25.901
Hey, bro, can I get a mint?

11:25.902 --> 11:27.818
- No.
- Come on!

11:27.819 --> 11:30.026
I'm always lending you stuff
and you never pay me back.

11:30.027 --> 11:32.568
Don't bust my balls!
Just give me a mint.

11:32.569 --> 11:35.776
All right, look,
if you promise to hit me back,

11:35.777 --> 11:39.193
I'll give you
one of my la petite mints.

11:39.194 --> 11:41.276
Okay.
I promise to give you one back.

11:41.277 --> 11:43.443
So, you currently have mints
in your possession?

11:43.444 --> 11:45.401
Well, I have a pack of mints
in my pocket right now.

11:45.402 --> 11:47.276
I just happen to like
Remy's flavor better.

11:47.277 --> 11:49.984
All right, well, just swear
on the "book of beelzebub".

11:49.985 --> 11:52.359
- Fine, I swear.
- Give me your hand.

11:52.360 --> 11:53.734
- Why?
- Blood oath!

11:53.735 --> 11:58.151
Ow! Geez, who does that anymore?

11:58.152 --> 12:03.401
"Uh, by the smitten brow of
Beelzebub, this oath doth bind me.

12:03.402 --> 12:07.568
May I keep its sacred words
or Beelzebub will find me."

12:07.569 --> 12:10.276
Yes! It's official!

12:10.277 --> 12:13.109
Wow, fuck, finally.

12:13.110 --> 12:15.068
Mmm.

12:15.069 --> 12:16.776
Now that's a refreshing mint.
That's what I'm talking about.

12:16.777 --> 12:19.276
Yes, I'm aware of that.
Now give me one of yours.

12:19.277 --> 12:21.526
Ah, yes, of course.

12:21.527 --> 12:25.568
Hm, wait a minute. That's weird.

12:25.569 --> 12:28.776
Oh, man, I thought I had my
mints, but I guess I don't.

12:28.777 --> 12:30.526
Sorry, I guess
I can't honor my oath.

12:30.527 --> 12:34.234
Oh! Typical curt.
Promise and don't deliver.

12:34.235 --> 12:36.693
Typical Remy,
always keeping score.

12:36.694 --> 12:38.693
- Uh, guys...
- You made an oath!

12:38.694 --> 12:41.234
- Who cares?
- You swore on devil shit!

12:41.235 --> 12:43.443
- Fuck devil shit!
- Whoa! Look out!

12:43.444 --> 12:45.901
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
What's going on?

12:45.902 --> 12:47.068
Everything's going in!

12:47.069 --> 12:47.985
- Hey!
- Curt!

12:47.986 --> 12:49.484
Hey! Help me!

12:49.485 --> 12:51.651
- Hold on!
- What the hell's going on?!

12:51.652 --> 12:54.359
What the fuck? -Is this one
of your bullshit tricks, Remy?

12:54.360 --> 12:57.109
If this is a prank,
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

12:57.110 --> 13:00.943
- No!
- Piece of shit!

13:00.944 --> 13:02.568
- What just happened?
- I don't know!

13:02.569 --> 13:04.901
- Jesus Christ!
- I have no idea what I just saw.

13:04.902 --> 13:05.819
What did you do?

13:05.820 --> 13:07.443
What are you talking about?
What did I do?

13:07.444 --> 13:09.401
I didn't conjure up a vortex!

13:09.402 --> 13:11.401
Curt just got sucked
into another dimension, Remy!

13:11.402 --> 13:13.234
Oh, really, Augie? I thought that
portal went to Barnes and noble.

13:13.235 --> 13:15.234
- We got to go in after him.
- Curt wouldn't go in after me.

13:15.235 --> 13:17.526
Yeah, he would.
He's your friend.

13:17.527 --> 13:18.859
I hate friends!

13:18.860 --> 13:20.484
You were the one
that made a blood oath.

13:20.485 --> 13:21.943
All right, let's go.

13:21.944 --> 13:25.694
This mysterious portal
better be quick!

13:44.569 --> 13:46.319
What is that?

14:02.610 --> 14:06.027
Dippin' dots! -I wish we
were at Barnes & Noble.

14:15.944 --> 14:18.193
I'm not being a pussy.
That was really scary, right?

14:18.194 --> 14:21.609
I'm so scared,
my shit just shit its pants.

14:21.610 --> 14:23.151
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

14:23.152 --> 14:24.984
Why do you act
like I've done this before?

14:24.985 --> 14:27.026
- What are those things?
- Look, it's curt!

14:27.027 --> 14:29.068
I'm an American, Jack!
Get your hands off me!

14:29.069 --> 14:32.902
- Don't waterboard me, dude!
- Where are we?

14:37.527 --> 14:39.902
We're screwed.
Who are those people?

14:54.902 --> 14:56.318
- Lake of fire!
- Sin!

14:56.319 --> 14:57.734
- Lake of fire!
- Sin!

14:57.735 --> 14:59.359
- Lake of fire!
- Sin!

14:59.360 --> 15:00.319
Lake of fire!

15:00.320 --> 15:01.693
Holy shit!

15:01.694 --> 15:04.569
Dude, we got to hide.

15:09.235 --> 15:10.943
May I take your order?

15:10.944 --> 15:14.776
I will have a pepperoni pizza,
please.

15:14.777 --> 15:16.401
There ain't no pepperoni pizza.

15:16.402 --> 15:19.276
Oh, I'm sorry, but it does say
pizza hut and taco bell,

15:19.277 --> 15:22.026
so I thought maybe I could get
some pizza as well.

15:22.027 --> 15:27.069
It says pizza, and it says taco,
but we only got taco.

15:29.277 --> 15:31.568
- You're being tortured.
- Oh, all right.

15:31.569 --> 15:33.568
Order another pizza. -I think
I see where this is headed.

15:33.569 --> 15:35.443
Just order the damn pizza!

15:35.444 --> 15:38.318
All right, we'll have a pizza
with extra cheese, please.

15:38.319 --> 15:39.859
There ain't no pizza.

15:39.860 --> 15:44.151
You can have
a Chalupa, burrito, Churro.

15:44.152 --> 15:46.693
Now, it does say pizza hut/taco bell.
Yeah.

15:46.694 --> 15:50.109
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Welcome to hell!

15:50.110 --> 15:51.984
Oh, my god! We're in hell!

15:51.985 --> 15:53.443
Lake of fire!

15:53.444 --> 15:54.943
"If you lend him a pen,
he chews on it."

15:54.944 --> 15:56.318
Lake of fire!

15:56.319 --> 15:58.068
"Fat guy
with the nickname "tiny"."

15:58.069 --> 16:00.234
Lake of fire!

16:00.235 --> 16:01.734
Lunch?

16:01.735 --> 16:03.151
Damn, man, we got 20 minutes
before break.

16:03.152 --> 16:04.776
Ah, who's gonna know?

16:04.777 --> 16:06.609
Sometimes I think your heart
is not in this anymore.

16:06.610 --> 16:08.359
Sorry, man, I'm just going
through

16:08.360 --> 16:10.776
some fucking life changes
right now, you know?

16:10.777 --> 16:12.568
I'm gonna throw you
in the fucking flame.

16:12.569 --> 16:14.818
- Is that a mortal?
- What the fuck are you doing?

16:14.819 --> 16:17.276
Who, us? Uh...

16:17.277 --> 16:20.026
Just floating around,
trying to get hammed, dude.

16:20.027 --> 16:22.943
Spring breakin' it.

16:22.944 --> 16:25.568
- Bullshit going on.
- Take 'em back to processing.

16:25.569 --> 16:27.318
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Take them to the office.

16:27.319 --> 16:30.151
- Where?
- Wait, let's talk about this!

16:30.152 --> 16:31.776
Ouch! Hey!

16:31.777 --> 16:32.610
Come on!

16:32.611 --> 16:35.151
Ouch! Ouch!

16:35.152 --> 16:39.359
Okay! Okay!

16:39.360 --> 16:41.443
Please remove
all religious paraphernalia.

16:41.444 --> 16:44.193
If you're a priest or a nun,
that's just really funny

16:44.194 --> 16:45.901
because you wasted your life.

16:45.902 --> 16:47.901
Enjoy your stay in hell,

16:47.902 --> 16:50.276
and remember, you're here
for a reason or you're Jewish.

16:50.277 --> 16:53.318
Pick up after yourself.
Your mother doesn't live here.

16:53.319 --> 16:55.902
If she does, she was a whore.

17:01.360 --> 17:04.526
What is this place?

17:04.527 --> 17:07.652
Wait, what the fuck
is that thing?

17:11.859 --> 17:13.108
Remy? Remy!

17:13.109 --> 17:14.902
What? There's nobody here.

17:18.609 --> 17:22.068
I don't know, Augie.
This place is incredible!

17:22.069 --> 17:24.068
No, Remy. Don't touch anything.

17:24.069 --> 17:25.984
This is stranger danger
all around us.

17:27.609 --> 17:30.984
Now, everyone,
eat your own genitals!

17:30.985 --> 17:33.068
Uh, we already ate 'em.

17:33.069 --> 17:36.568
Well, throw up your genitals
and eat them again!

17:36.569 --> 17:39.276
Our budget is out of control!

17:39.277 --> 17:41.151
And I've got a report here

17:41.152 --> 17:46.193
that says we're making lost
souls walk over warm coals!

17:46.194 --> 17:48.359
Ah, they're pretty hot.

17:48.360 --> 17:51.651
I walked over them myself! It felt
like a freaking foot massage!

17:51.652 --> 17:53.318
We've all had to cut corners.

17:53.319 --> 17:56.068
Even the gluttons are beginning
to look anorexic.

17:56.069 --> 17:58.443
Our dental plan
has a steep deductible.

17:58.444 --> 18:01.234
Our union hasn't had a sacrifice
in three years.

18:01.235 --> 18:03.151
The reason that shit's all
fucked up

18:03.152 --> 18:05.068
is 'cause we're not paying
our people right.

18:05.069 --> 18:06.734
- Yeah!
- Yeah, our team!

18:06.735 --> 18:09.027
Hell, yeah, nigger!

18:10.985 --> 18:13.068
Dude, I can't believe
you used the n-word.

18:13.069 --> 18:16.276
What? No, I could say it down here.
All right, down here's okay.

18:16.277 --> 18:20.194
All of you,
get the fuck out of here!

18:31.485 --> 18:34.818
He is being a real bitch today.

18:34.819 --> 18:37.109
Gloria, hold my calls!

18:37.110 --> 18:40.401
Hump day.

18:40.402 --> 18:42.901
The lunchroom fridge
will be cleaned out on Friday.

18:42.902 --> 18:44.984
They should at least give us
till Monday.

18:44.985 --> 18:47.151
If you leave any food or drinks
or containers in there...

18:47.152 --> 18:49.234
- My spring rolls?
- They will be thrown out.

18:49.235 --> 18:51.901
- That's my food! It's still good!
- What?

18:51.902 --> 18:55.443
P.S. You also have a time-sensitive
e-mail from the demon's union.

18:55.444 --> 18:57.984
Oh, demon's union!
What do they want?

18:57.985 --> 18:59.693
They put in a request

18:59.694 --> 19:02.526
to have the new mortal
tortured and sacrificed.

19:02.527 --> 19:04.651
Curt's gonna be sacrificed?

19:04.652 --> 19:06.901
- We've got to find him.
- Oh, boy.

19:06.902 --> 19:09.568
P.P.S. Barb's on her way down
here from heaven.

19:09.569 --> 19:12.151
What? She's flying down here
right now?

19:12.152 --> 19:14.818
- I'll tell her you're unavailable.
- No, no, no!

19:14.819 --> 19:17.776
Tell her I've cleared
my schedule just for her.

19:17.777 --> 19:19.359
Okay.

19:19.360 --> 19:21.734
I'm gonna be off the grid
for a few minutes.

19:21.735 --> 19:24.818
Now, I'll just rub one out so I
don't finish too quickly tonight.

19:24.819 --> 19:28.194
Ah! "Shirtz 'n' skinz" with a z.

19:30.860 --> 19:34.568
I love the way
you shoot up my heart

19:34.569 --> 19:38.234
now we'll get naked
as the day we were born

19:38.235 --> 19:40.443
she's straight from heaven

19:40.444 --> 19:42.109
I won't let go

19:42.110 --> 19:45.234
I won't let go, go, go

19:45.235 --> 19:46.818
hey, Remy, what are you doing?

19:46.819 --> 19:49.068
I'm looking for clues
to help us find curt.

19:49.069 --> 19:53.110
Ooh, the devil's cell phone.
That might come in handy.

19:58.610 --> 20:01.776
The devil's actual devil's brew.

20:01.777 --> 20:03.110
Oh oh.

20:08.319 --> 20:11.527
Augie! Are you okay?

20:13.902 --> 20:16.943
Yeah, motherfucker!
That's the real shit!

20:16.944 --> 20:19.776
Shh. -More, more, I need more.
Please, please, give me more.

20:19.777 --> 20:23.609
I'd drink a pint of ass blood
for another sip of that brew!

20:23.610 --> 20:25.193
I need it inside of me!

20:25.194 --> 20:27.818
If heaven's right,
then I want to be wrong in hell

20:27.819 --> 20:29.902
with that sweet, sweet ambrosia!

20:37.277 --> 20:39.151
Love seat.

20:39.152 --> 20:42.694
She's my angel

20:43.569 --> 20:45.777
huh?

20:48.944 --> 20:51.193
What the hell
are you two doing here?

20:51.194 --> 20:53.984
Uh... uh... uh... -We're just
trying to save our friend curt.

20:53.985 --> 20:56.151
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You know, just in and out.

20:56.152 --> 21:00.693
Really? Who do you think you
are, Orpheus?

21:00.694 --> 21:02.151
Who's Orpheus?

21:02.152 --> 21:06.068
You don't know
your Greek mythology, do you?

21:06.069 --> 21:09.859
Orpheus, the mortal who came
down to hell to rescue his wife?

21:09.860 --> 21:12.318
Anyone? Man, public education!

21:12.319 --> 21:14.401
No wonder the Chinese
are kickin' our ass.

21:14.402 --> 21:17.651
Wait, so he finds mortals
and rescues them from hell?

21:17.652 --> 21:20.734
Because you know what we do
to mortals in hell.

21:20.735 --> 21:22.901
Barb is on her way
down to your office.

21:22.902 --> 21:25.234
I told her she can't go in
unannounced.

21:25.235 --> 21:27.901
Damn! Look, I'm gonna kill both
of you,

21:27.902 --> 21:30.318
but I need some time alone
with an angel first,

21:30.319 --> 21:33.401
so sit over here and enjoy
your last few moments alive.

21:33.402 --> 21:34.818
It's gonna be great.
You're gonna love it.

21:34.819 --> 21:36.443
- Take your time!
- Yeah, no hurry.

21:36.444 --> 21:38.694
See you in a few.

21:48.652 --> 21:54.776
I've been loving you for so long

21:54.777 --> 22:00.444
I don't know if it's
right or wrong -ooh!

22:02.069 --> 22:05.859
Whoa, doll,
look at this new style of yours.

22:05.860 --> 22:08.234
You're quite the dandy.

22:08.235 --> 22:11.734
That's a real statement.

22:11.735 --> 22:13.359
Wow! You really look good.

22:13.360 --> 22:14.943
Oh, you.

22:14.944 --> 22:17.651
- How do you do it?
- Low Carbs and porn.

22:17.652 --> 22:19.276
Barb, you got nice ones.

22:19.277 --> 22:22.151
Aww. See,
I'm not wearing a bra either.

22:22.152 --> 22:23.651
No, your wings.

22:23.652 --> 22:25.443
Have you had work done
on your wings?

22:25.444 --> 22:27.318
- No.
- They're gorgeous.

22:27.319 --> 22:30.568
- Oh, devil, stop it.
- Ooh.

22:30.569 --> 22:33.276
I have a little problem.

22:33.277 --> 22:34.943
I want to help so bad.

22:34.944 --> 22:38.401
Somehow, I have to find
and extract two mortals

22:38.402 --> 22:42.026
from unauthorized damnation
within your jurisdiction.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.651
Two mortals, huh?

22:43.652 --> 22:46.401
If I find them for you,
what's my reward?

22:46.402 --> 22:49.193
If you find them,
I'll do things with you

22:49.194 --> 22:52.193
that would make
the Internet blush.

22:52.194 --> 22:56.484
Oooh. Yeah.

22:56.485 --> 22:58.943
This is my lucky day.

22:58.944 --> 23:01.818
Look over there, Barb!

23:01.819 --> 23:03.068
Mini golf?

23:03.069 --> 23:06.734
Wait, hold on. Keep looking.

23:06.735 --> 23:08.819
- What?
- Work, machine!

23:10.194 --> 23:12.568
You know what? Stop. Just stop.

23:12.569 --> 23:14.901
Wait! Barb, where are you going?

23:14.902 --> 23:16.901
I'm flying back to heaven.

23:16.902 --> 23:19.276
Don't text me until you've found
the two mortals.

23:19.277 --> 23:21.234
Wait! Barb, I... I love you.

23:21.235 --> 23:24.859
Good luck!

23:24.860 --> 23:28.651
Gloria, I need you to put out
an APB on those two mortals.

23:28.652 --> 23:31.026
And make it clear
that if they're not found,

23:31.027 --> 23:34.234
I will rip
every demon's head off!

23:34.235 --> 23:36.693
Do you have any idea
where they're heading?

23:36.694 --> 23:41.318
Mmm, I might have told them
about Orpheus a little.

23:41.319 --> 23:43.651
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

23:43.652 --> 23:47.026
Attention, demons, there are two
mortals on the loose in hell.

23:47.027 --> 23:49.109
So, if everyone could
put down your Spears

23:49.110 --> 23:50.651
and look around your work area.

23:50.652 --> 23:52.526
Repeat, two mortals.

23:52.527 --> 23:55.359
Did we just get name-checked
by hell's public address system?

23:55.360 --> 23:57.276
One is a normal-looking guy,

23:57.277 --> 23:59.984
and the other one looks
like he only eats dough.

23:59.985 --> 24:02.193
That seemed a little mean.
Anybody?

24:02.194 --> 24:03.984
Whoa!
Augie, Augie, check it out.

24:03.985 --> 24:06.693
A gondola. Let's go!

24:06.694 --> 24:11.234
We are deploying all demons to
locate and capture the two mortals.

24:11.235 --> 24:13.651
They are on their way
to find Orpheus.

24:13.652 --> 24:15.902
Orpheus!

24:29.819 --> 24:31.818
Dude, we're gone-dola
in 60 seconds.

24:31.819 --> 24:33.193
Boo.

24:33.194 --> 24:35.151
What? Gone in 60 seconds
is a movie

24:35.152 --> 24:36.401
about you eating a wedding cake.

24:36.402 --> 24:37.651
Do you know where we're going?

24:37.652 --> 24:39.651
Let's find Orpheus.

24:39.652 --> 24:41.526
I got an idea
for another great punishment.

24:41.527 --> 24:44.318
Imagine this. Hot girl.
She asks you out.

24:44.319 --> 24:46.526
She's like,
"hey, let's go do Bikram yoga."

24:46.527 --> 24:48.026
You go. You do yoga.

24:48.027 --> 24:49.859
It's hot. It's sweaty.
She looks fucking great.

24:49.860 --> 24:53.484
She shows you every major
flexibility that she has.

24:53.485 --> 24:54.943
Sweaty in all the right places.

24:54.944 --> 24:57.068
What do they call that one move?
Dog down.

24:57.069 --> 24:59.068
She can get her feet
behind her ears.

24:59.069 --> 25:01.943
She can put her legs
behind her fucking neck...

25:01.944 --> 25:04.193
and walk home on her ass.

25:04.194 --> 25:06.318
She's making her body
into that alphabet

25:06.319 --> 25:07.484
right there on that yoga mat.

25:07.485 --> 25:09.276
A, b, c, d.

25:09.277 --> 25:11.109
- And she's spelling out "fuck me".
- Of course she is!

25:11.110 --> 25:12.818
While you're doing yoga,
which sucks for you,

25:12.819 --> 25:15.443
but you're gonna do it 'cause you're
gonna get to fuck this hot girl after.

25:15.444 --> 25:17.068
Oh, I love that!

25:17.069 --> 25:18.818
End of the night,
"good night, I got to go home."

25:18.819 --> 25:20.276
What?

25:20.277 --> 25:23.109
So you do yoga day after day
and no sex.

25:23.110 --> 25:26.068
That would be the ultimate
punishment for any man.

25:26.069 --> 25:27.776
That's a great punishment.

25:27.777 --> 25:30.026
I've always feared that I was
meant to die a virgin.

25:30.027 --> 25:31.526
Like, that's my main purpose.

25:31.527 --> 25:32.943
Shut up, Augie!

25:32.944 --> 25:34.818
Hey, does that look
like those mortals?

25:34.819 --> 25:36.943
- They found us!
- Oh, I guess it is.

25:36.944 --> 25:38.776
Throw them in the lake of fire!

25:38.777 --> 25:41.193
The mortals have been
spotted on the devil's gondola.

25:41.194 --> 25:42.609
- Come on.
- Over here!

25:42.610 --> 25:44.984
Bring back the mortals alive!

25:44.985 --> 25:47.151
- Let's go!
- No.

25:47.152 --> 25:50.360
- Three, two, one.
- It's a living.

25:56.110 --> 25:58.569
Run! Run!

26:00.819 --> 26:02.359
Get back here!

26:02.360 --> 26:04.859
You're not going anywhere!

26:04.860 --> 26:09.276
- Augie!
- I'm gonna fuck you two up!

26:09.277 --> 26:12.484
- Where you gonna go now?
- Hold on!

26:12.485 --> 26:13.943
- There he is!
- Get 'em!

26:13.944 --> 26:15.401
Kill 'em!

26:15.402 --> 26:16.693
No! My mints!

26:16.694 --> 26:18.526
Hey, everybody, we got mints!

26:18.527 --> 26:20.277
It's raining mints!

26:22.944 --> 26:24.984
Now I got you!

26:24.985 --> 26:26.734
Hold on!

26:26.735 --> 26:28.859
You like getting stabbed?

26:28.860 --> 26:31.901
I'll cut that little face
of yours.

26:31.902 --> 26:34.152
- Maybe I'll make a bigger mouth.
- No, no, no, no.

26:54.485 --> 26:55.818
Here, you want a soda pop?

26:55.819 --> 26:57.526
Oh, I wouldn't say no.

26:57.527 --> 27:00.984
It's flat! You got flat soda!

27:00.985 --> 27:03.026
You got me.

27:03.027 --> 27:04.901
Here, you want
some Neapolitan ice cream?

27:04.902 --> 27:06.526
- Oh, thank you!
- All right, here it is.

27:06.527 --> 27:08.151
Oh, now, someone seems
to have eaten

27:08.152 --> 27:09.776
all of the chocolate
and vanilla.

27:09.777 --> 27:11.484
That's right.
You just have strawberry.

27:11.485 --> 27:13.859
Oh, well.

27:13.860 --> 27:17.734
- You should drink some of this milk.
- I'm not usually a milk drinker.

27:17.735 --> 27:19.401
- It's quik!
- Yeah.

27:19.402 --> 27:21.568
- It's strawberry quik!
- Not even chocolate quik.

27:21.569 --> 27:24.359
- No, it's that strawberry crap.
- Not fun.

27:24.360 --> 27:26.069
Welcome to hell!

27:29.902 --> 27:32.818
Let's see.
Alumni association, no thanks.

27:32.819 --> 27:34.943
Starving children, fuck you.

27:34.944 --> 27:37.568
Devil, Sal
and Dave called to say

27:37.569 --> 27:40.609
they lost the two mortals
you were looking for.

27:40.610 --> 27:42.568
I think Barb's gonna be
disappointed.

27:42.569 --> 27:46.818
Damn it! I'm surrounded by
idiots. Put them through.

27:46.819 --> 27:49.734
Hey, boss.

27:49.735 --> 27:51.526
What are you doing?

27:51.527 --> 27:55.901
I just did yoga. Turns out
dudes only. Huge bummer.

27:55.902 --> 27:58.568
Oh, good! Oh, good!
You're finding your core.

27:58.569 --> 28:00.109
This is good to hear.

28:00.110 --> 28:05.193
Hey, once you find your core,
go find the mortals!

28:05.194 --> 28:06.651
Okay, plan of attack.

28:06.652 --> 28:08.984
Let's see. If I... A-ha!

28:08.985 --> 28:10.818
Gloria, I need you to announce

28:10.819 --> 28:13.443
the biggest sacrifice
at the crossroads

28:13.444 --> 28:16.443
- that hell has ever seen.
- Okay, devil.

28:16.444 --> 28:22.152
Then I'll simply wait for the
other mortals to come to me.

28:24.027 --> 28:27.152
I really got to grow a mustache.

28:36.485 --> 28:39.735
Now, let's see here. Push this.

28:40.985 --> 28:43.984
Faster than I remembered.

28:43.985 --> 28:47.359
This elevator can't be
up to code!

28:47.360 --> 28:49.569
Let's see, the last time
it was inspected was...

28:53.777 --> 28:56.068
Okay, voided my bowels.

28:56.069 --> 28:59.027
You can do this, buddy.
This is for the demons.

29:03.152 --> 29:05.609
They love this shit.
Let's do this!

29:05.610 --> 29:09.152
All right, everybody.
Prepare to meet our dark lord!

29:10.652 --> 29:12.651
All hail the god of lies!

29:12.652 --> 29:14.193
You're goddamn right!

29:14.194 --> 29:16.943
- The worst of the worst!
- Fucking a!

29:16.944 --> 29:19.443
The hell pig of butt mountain!

29:19.444 --> 29:20.818
Don't love that one.

29:20.819 --> 29:22.943
The douchiest of all bags.

29:22.944 --> 29:24.276
That was kind of mean, actually.

29:24.277 --> 29:26.276
The dick of all assholes!

29:26.277 --> 29:28.193
Okay, that's enough.

29:28.194 --> 29:30.734
The guy who fucks your mother
and tells you about it.

29:30.735 --> 29:35.069
Always just one step too far!

29:36.527 --> 29:38.568
Where's the fucking mortal?

29:38.569 --> 29:41.359
Hot fuck action to the Max

29:41.360 --> 29:45.651
that's what I like
hot fuck action to the Max

29:45.652 --> 29:47.359
got a big dick

29:47.360 --> 29:49.568
what do you have to say
for yourself?

29:49.569 --> 29:51.193
Oh. Where am I?

29:51.194 --> 29:53.526
You poor dumb bastard.

29:53.527 --> 29:55.776
You don't even know
what's going on.

29:55.777 --> 29:57.568
Fella, you're in hell!

29:57.569 --> 29:59.859
Oh, boy. And who are you?

29:59.860 --> 30:01.651
Can you believe this guy?

30:01.652 --> 30:04.901
I'm the fucking devil!

30:04.902 --> 30:09.068
No one had the decency to torture
this guy before I got down here?

30:09.069 --> 30:11.984
The boys were just hoping
to see the master at work.

30:11.985 --> 30:14.401
You are the man, the devil!

30:14.402 --> 30:16.193
Enough ass kissing!

30:16.194 --> 30:21.901
Now, which one of these dastardly
contraptions shall I use?

30:21.902 --> 30:25.276
Ah, perhaps this one.

30:25.277 --> 30:28.652
Oh, no, no. That's our Foosball
table, chief.

30:29.985 --> 30:31.818
Moving on.

30:31.819 --> 30:33.818
A-ha.

30:33.819 --> 30:36.693
Get in here.

30:36.694 --> 30:40.234
Okay.

30:40.235 --> 30:45.859
There! Tell me of the pain
you feel so we may laugh at you.

30:45.860 --> 30:48.443
Uh... okay.

30:48.444 --> 30:50.234
Actually, the bouncing
up and down

30:50.235 --> 30:52.109
is kind of giving me a tickle
in a funny spot.

30:52.110 --> 30:53.526
It is not tickling!

30:53.527 --> 30:54.818
Is this a Sybian?

30:54.819 --> 30:57.193
- No!
- I assure you this is a Sybian.

30:57.194 --> 30:58.194
- You get off it.
- Try this.

30:58.195 --> 30:59.443
Let me on.

30:59.444 --> 31:02.609
- Let me get off.
- Let me on!

31:02.610 --> 31:05.444
It's a Sybian.

31:15.819 --> 31:17.734
Oh, wait a minute, guys,
seriously.

31:17.735 --> 31:20.818
Come on, what do you want?
I'll give you anything.

31:20.819 --> 31:23.068
Please don't do this,
for god's sake!

31:23.069 --> 31:26.318
Please! I'll stroke your shaft
and play with your nuts!

31:26.319 --> 31:28.234
I'll stick my fingers
in your ass.

31:28.235 --> 31:30.109
I will tickle your balls.

31:30.110 --> 31:33.985
I'll suck everybody's cock here!
Whose cock is first?

31:35.777 --> 31:38.234
Don't do this! I'll suck...
Oh, god!

31:38.235 --> 31:42.526
Kill them all
and let god sort 'em out.

31:42.527 --> 31:44.651
Who's next?

31:44.652 --> 31:48.734
Shut up, or I'll drill your brains
and turn you into sex zombies.

31:48.735 --> 31:50.193
Why are you mortals here?

31:50.194 --> 31:51.359
I...

31:51.360 --> 31:53.193
He found a crying devil book

31:53.194 --> 31:55.193
and made our friend
take a blood oath,

31:55.194 --> 31:57.651
which I was up for, but now
I look back on as a mistake.

31:57.652 --> 31:59.651
And he broke the oath.
That's why we're here.

31:59.652 --> 32:02.318
Not because I... -why are
you looking for Orpheus?

32:02.319 --> 32:07.069
Because he... -because Orpheus is the
only one who can save our friend!

32:09.694 --> 32:11.401
- Girl.
- Girl.

32:11.402 --> 32:14.734
- Hey, you tricked us!
- Yeah, that's false advertising.

32:14.735 --> 32:17.359
I know, I'm bad.

32:17.360 --> 32:20.276
But I could still kill you
'cause I'm half-demon.

32:20.277 --> 32:22.484
- Oh, okay.
- Take me to Orpheus!

32:22.485 --> 32:25.318
Only if you take us
to curt first.

32:25.319 --> 32:27.359
Fuck, no.

32:27.360 --> 32:31.401
Yeah, the way I see it, you
can't find Orpheus without us,

32:31.402 --> 32:35.818
so we've got the upper hand,
purple lady!

32:35.819 --> 32:39.068
Take me to Orpheus!

32:39.069 --> 32:40.776
Hey, that's my heart.

32:40.777 --> 32:42.651
Ten, nine...

32:42.652 --> 32:44.151
Heart belongs in body.

32:44.152 --> 32:46.734
Oh, do you need
your little heart? Seven...

32:46.735 --> 32:48.234
Pretty sure you're gonna die!

32:48.235 --> 32:50.068
Take my liver.
It's already dead.

32:50.069 --> 32:52.526
- It needs its owner.
- Put it back in.

32:52.527 --> 32:55.151
Five... Oh, it's slowing down.

32:55.152 --> 32:57.859
Three, two...

32:57.860 --> 33:00.193
That shouldn't be outside
of my body.

33:00.194 --> 33:03.318
Take your last breath.

33:03.319 --> 33:05.902
Okay, okay, okay,
don't kill my friend!

33:08.360 --> 33:12.151
I saw a white light, and then
my grandma-mommy was there,

33:12.152 --> 33:15.318
and she was like, "hey, Remington,
would you like a cookie?"

33:15.319 --> 33:16.693
Where's Orpheus?

33:16.694 --> 33:18.276
Okay! Okay!
I got his address in here.

33:18.277 --> 33:19.859
Cracked screen.

33:19.860 --> 33:22.109
He's in the ancient...

33:22.110 --> 33:24.484
The ancient realm.

33:24.485 --> 33:28.943
It looks like the corner of inferno
and Martin Luther king Jr. drive.

33:28.944 --> 33:30.734
That sounds
like a good neighborhood.

33:30.735 --> 33:32.359
Do you know where that is?

33:32.360 --> 33:35.068
Durmessa. That lying bitch.

33:35.069 --> 33:37.276
He's been down there
this whole time.

33:37.277 --> 33:39.859
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

33:39.860 --> 33:43.568
You guys help me find Orpheus, and
I'll get you to your friend curt.

33:43.569 --> 33:46.610
- Yes.
- Deal!

33:50.569 --> 33:54.068
Okay, everyone, keep it down.

33:54.069 --> 33:55.818
Let's get this thing started.

33:55.819 --> 33:58.359
Oh, is that the mortal
you're feeding to Beelzebub?

33:58.360 --> 34:01.151
Don't worry about it, okay?
I got it handled.

34:01.152 --> 34:03.526
Gang, curt. Curt, gang.

34:03.527 --> 34:06.110
Hey, nobody told me it was
bring your mortal to work day.

34:07.777 --> 34:09.775
Oh, is that what you think
we're here for,

34:09.777 --> 34:11.693
so you can all make jokes?

34:11.694 --> 34:14.275
I just got word
we're gonna start judging pets

34:14.277 --> 34:16.650
so dogs can go to heaven.

34:16.652 --> 34:18.234
You know what that means?

34:18.235 --> 34:21.318
Yes! We're getting
all the asshole dogs!

34:21.319 --> 34:23.568
Yeah, we get
like inbred motherfuckers.

34:23.569 --> 34:27.525
That's a lot of dogs. Now, I'm
not running a kennel here.

34:27.527 --> 34:28.900
Hey, you!
Does everyone have dogs?

34:28.902 --> 34:31.443
Well, not everyone.
I have a cat.

34:31.444 --> 34:33.818
You know what the hardest part
about having cats is?

34:33.819 --> 34:36.194
Telling your parents
you're gay. No.

34:37.860 --> 34:39.775
Hey! Cut the homophobic shit,
you got it?

34:39.777 --> 34:42.569
Did you know that Azazel
over here is gay?

34:44.610 --> 34:46.443
Sorry to out you, AZ.

34:46.444 --> 34:48.734
Anyway, now I got to figure out

34:48.735 --> 34:51.693
who's gonna clean up
all that dog shit! -No!

34:51.694 --> 34:54.193
Hey, bro, just let
the fucking mortal do it.

34:54.194 --> 34:55.693
Or feed it to the gluttons.

34:55.694 --> 34:58.444
- Yeah, dawg!
- Yeah! That's the way to do it.

35:02.402 --> 35:05.693
Will all of you
get the fuck out of here?!

35:05.694 --> 35:08.943
What, what?
Somebody's crazy evil today.

35:08.944 --> 35:12.235
Curt, come sit over here, buddy.

35:16.485 --> 35:18.901
- Whoa!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

35:18.902 --> 35:21.318
Hold on, it's gonna get bumpy!

35:21.319 --> 35:23.484
Deema, I think we're lost!

35:23.485 --> 35:26.610
The GPS says we're supposed to
pass a bail bonds and a wig store.

35:29.194 --> 35:33.818
These idiots that work for me
make a pile of shit,

35:33.819 --> 35:35.379
and then they say,
"turn it into roses."

35:37.360 --> 35:39.734
- Whoa! Whoa, what happened?
- Oh, that's better.

35:39.735 --> 35:41.359
Bro, you just fucking shrunk.

35:41.360 --> 35:44.276
Well, that version of me
is sort of my business suit.

35:44.277 --> 35:46.693
- Keeps the demons in line.
- Really?

35:46.694 --> 35:49.526
Devil, the computer
network is down again.

35:49.527 --> 35:51.068
I don't need this right now.

35:51.069 --> 35:53.609
And it can't get here
till tomorrow.

35:53.610 --> 35:56.359
Do you know that everything
we use here is Dell?

35:56.360 --> 35:58.734
- Can you believe that?
- Uh...

35:58.735 --> 36:01.943
I would much prefer a Mac. It's
friendlier for creative types.

36:01.944 --> 36:03.984
You know,
I consider myself an artist.

36:03.985 --> 36:07.401
Oh, an artist like Picasso
or Banksy? Can I see some work?

36:07.402 --> 36:10.443
Well, I do have this one thing
that I've been working on.

36:10.444 --> 36:12.776
- Oh, you got to let me see it.
- It's a black-light painting.

36:12.777 --> 36:15.401
And you see here, this is a little
devil on a dune buggy, right?

36:15.402 --> 36:18.568
And he's flipping off...

36:18.569 --> 36:21.068
What? What is that?
I can't read your reaction.

36:21.069 --> 36:22.568
No, it's really good.

36:22.569 --> 36:24.068
Interesting thing about this...

36:24.069 --> 36:25.526
Looks like a fucking cartoon.

36:25.527 --> 36:27.651
Nope. That's a realist painting.

36:27.652 --> 36:30.651
That's fucking hilarious. God! Do
you have any more funny pictures?

36:30.652 --> 36:32.484
No. You don't get to see
any more of my art.

36:32.485 --> 36:34.359
There's your first punishment
in hell.

36:34.360 --> 36:37.652
- That's...
- You did it to yourself.

36:40.985 --> 36:42.901
We're almost there.

36:42.902 --> 36:46.027
- I got to go to the bathroom.
- -Use a cup.

36:51.360 --> 36:54.152
This is the way to Orpheus.

36:57.944 --> 37:00.359
What is this place?
A microbrewery?

37:00.360 --> 37:04.026
Stay behind me and keep quiet.

37:04.027 --> 37:06.152
What the fuck is that thing?

37:07.777 --> 37:09.526
Durmessa.

37:09.527 --> 37:11.151
You want to party?

37:11.152 --> 37:13.026
She's been
in a two-thousand-year bender.

37:13.027 --> 37:15.901
I want you to come on over here
and look under my flap.

37:15.902 --> 37:18.943
Please, stop.
Is that right, mom?

37:18.944 --> 37:20.943
- Mom?
- How could you do it?

37:20.944 --> 37:23.068
All these years,
I've been searching,

37:23.069 --> 37:24.818
and he's been down here
this whole time!

37:24.819 --> 37:27.318
He's a fuckface and a deadbeat.

37:27.319 --> 37:30.859
What? Orpheus is a poet,
a noble warrior.

37:30.860 --> 37:33.443
You're in love with a drink!

37:33.444 --> 37:36.734
You wouldn't dare!

37:36.735 --> 37:39.068
Open the portal.

37:39.069 --> 37:42.359
You stupid little bitch!

37:42.360 --> 37:44.068
Devil's brew!

37:44.069 --> 37:47.109
I'll lick your can
for 30 more drops of it!

37:47.110 --> 37:49.860
Stop it! I'll fucking kill you!

37:51.485 --> 37:53.776
You should have told me!

37:53.777 --> 37:57.484
I'm a swan!

37:57.485 --> 38:00.776
My bottom says meow.

38:00.777 --> 38:03.943
- You fat Pillbilly!
- Ow!

38:03.944 --> 38:06.068
You're letting us through!

38:06.069 --> 38:07.318
Stop it!

38:07.319 --> 38:08.526
I made smelly.

38:08.527 --> 38:10.484
God, Deema!

38:10.485 --> 38:12.193
Parkour!

38:12.194 --> 38:13.776
My hands and feet are cops!

38:13.777 --> 38:17.194
- My hands and feet are cops!
- No, no, no!

38:18.360 --> 38:20.610
- Oh, mama!
- Oh, god!

38:29.027 --> 38:30.734
Why are we going
down here again?

38:30.735 --> 38:33.234
- Curt.
- Right. Your friend curt.

38:33.235 --> 38:38.401
- Our friend curt.
- Yeah.

38:38.402 --> 38:41.276
He's not what you think.

38:41.277 --> 38:45.194
He's only gonna
disappoint you, Deema.

38:46.485 --> 38:49.194
I'm used to disappointment.

38:57.235 --> 38:59.609
It feels like my brain is
vibrating in a good way.

38:59.610 --> 39:02.734
Best thing about whip-its, you'll
feel totally fine in 15 seconds.

39:02.735 --> 39:05.152
We used to do these
at the carnival all the time.

39:09.069 --> 39:12.693
So, devil, what's your story,
man? How'd you get down here?

39:12.694 --> 39:14.234
I used to live upstairs,
you know.

39:14.235 --> 39:16.068
Was actually besties
with the big man.

39:16.069 --> 39:17.609
- You mean god?
- Yes, sir.

39:17.610 --> 39:19.401
I was in charge
of his armies, too.

39:19.402 --> 39:20.984
But they went off to battle,

39:20.985 --> 39:23.193
and I was off
with this sweet set of wings.

39:23.194 --> 39:26.026
Man, there was this angel
that was epic in bed.

39:26.027 --> 39:30.151
- She had a pussy inside her pussy.
- What? Is that real?

39:30.152 --> 39:35.234
Turns out god was dating her,
too, so, I guess I'm the asshole.

39:35.235 --> 39:37.193
So, wait, wait, wait,
you're the devil

39:37.194 --> 39:39.276
and have been condemned
to hell for eternity

39:39.277 --> 39:41.818
- for fucking god's girlfriend?
- Yup.

39:41.819 --> 39:44.734
Whoa, it sounds like you got
some kind of angel fetish, man.

39:44.735 --> 39:46.109
They're gonna be
the death of me.

39:46.110 --> 39:48.276
- Check this shit out.
- Oh, yeah!

39:48.277 --> 39:50.443
- Wow, what's her name?
- Barb.

39:50.444 --> 39:52.026
I fucking love her, man.

39:52.027 --> 39:55.151
- But she barely knows I exist.
- Oh, I doubt that.

39:55.152 --> 39:59.444
Oh, man, those wings
are so white and soft.

40:02.110 --> 40:05.401
Barb, why aren't we married?

40:05.402 --> 40:07.694
Whoa!

40:10.652 --> 40:13.276
Migraines in hell
are really bad.

40:13.277 --> 40:14.526
I blacked out.

40:14.527 --> 40:16.526
Yeah.

40:16.527 --> 40:19.776
Don't let me drink devil's brew
again. Oh, my god.

40:19.777 --> 40:22.318
Hey, I didn't have sex
with that blue lady, did I?

40:22.319 --> 40:24.651
Not in the biblical sense.

40:24.652 --> 40:27.443
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

40:27.444 --> 40:29.359
This must be the way to Orpheus.

40:29.360 --> 40:30.859
What, we're gonna swim there?

40:30.860 --> 40:32.484
Nope, we're gonna take
that submersible.

40:32.485 --> 40:35.901
Cool.

40:35.902 --> 40:39.318
Augie, take this rope
and attach it to that hook.

40:39.319 --> 40:42.401
Remy, you go inside
and man the controls.

40:42.402 --> 40:43.526
Come on, hop to it.

40:43.527 --> 40:45.443
Jeez, who's side are you on?

40:45.444 --> 40:47.859
- What, you don't like teamwork?
- I'm just trying to be positive

40:47.860 --> 40:52.318
and build a foundation of trust
within the framework. Wow!

40:52.319 --> 40:54.526
Oh, yeah.

40:54.527 --> 40:58.484
Me Strokey. Me have a Strokey.

40:58.485 --> 41:02.651
Losing motor skills.
Tasting pennies.

41:02.652 --> 41:06.402
I'm releasing the first cable
now, Augie!

41:09.985 --> 41:12.277
Damn it, Augie, get inside!

41:13.777 --> 41:17.526
I'll have to adjust
the ballast manually.

41:17.527 --> 41:20.901
Hey, what happened?
I'm so fake interested.

41:20.902 --> 41:23.069
Whoa.

41:40.569 --> 41:42.901
- Whoa.
- Purple paradise.

41:42.902 --> 41:45.109
Come on. You guys,
if we're gonna get through this,

41:45.110 --> 41:46.943
you're gonna have
to listen to me.

41:46.944 --> 41:49.652
- I do what I want when I want.
- Really?

41:50.944 --> 41:52.776
Get this off me!

41:52.777 --> 41:55.527
You're gonna wear this
until you learn to listen.

41:57.777 --> 42:00.859
Well, dip me in salt
and lick my asshole.

42:00.860 --> 42:02.318
What?

42:02.319 --> 42:05.901
It's a saying
I'm trying to get started.

42:05.902 --> 42:09.068
- Hey, what's this?
- Yeah, that's my idea book.

42:09.069 --> 42:12.484
I jot down new punishments I
think of as I go about my day.

42:12.485 --> 42:15.151
Well, the devil has
a little genius pad.

42:15.152 --> 42:16.609
Let's hear what you got.

42:16.610 --> 42:18.484
It's a catapult, right,
with poop inside.

42:18.485 --> 42:20.401
See, now these here,
they're stink lines.

42:20.402 --> 42:22.109
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, devil.

42:22.110 --> 42:24.109
That dude getting sacrificed
looks a lot like me.

42:24.110 --> 42:25.984
Yeah, my cartoonist
is good, huh?

42:25.985 --> 42:28.234
What, you mean
that's supposed to be me?

42:28.235 --> 42:30.359
Yeah. You're the one being sacrificed.
I thought I told you that.

42:30.360 --> 42:32.569
What?

42:36.444 --> 42:39.734
Augie, get your head in the game, man!
What's the matter with you?

42:39.735 --> 42:42.776
I don't know, Remy.
I think I'm in love.

42:42.777 --> 42:45.734
Oh, no, no, no.
We're coming in too fast.

42:45.735 --> 42:48.151
You wouldn't even know
what to do with her!

42:48.152 --> 42:50.901
Okay, little tubby kid
from "goonies"?

42:50.902 --> 42:52.151
30 degrees to starboard!

42:52.152 --> 42:53.693
I got it, Deema. I'll do it!

42:53.694 --> 42:57.359
See? We have a connection, Remy.

42:57.360 --> 42:59.526
Why is the sub listing? Oh, no.

42:59.527 --> 43:02.859
- This is really bad, Augie.
- She said, "augie"!

43:02.860 --> 43:05.443
You're in the friend zone,
and you don't even know it.

43:05.444 --> 43:07.401
How would you know
the friend zone?

43:07.402 --> 43:09.984
I've only read about the friend
zone in bummer magazine.

43:09.985 --> 43:15.694
See, I love nobody, and that's
what makes me a leader.

43:18.527 --> 43:20.277
What the fuck is that?

43:30.152 --> 43:33.151
This is an rpg nightmare.

43:33.152 --> 43:36.109
Where there's no leveling up.
Oh, my god.

43:36.110 --> 43:37.568
Deema, are you okay?

43:37.569 --> 43:40.527
We've crossed over
to the ancient realm.

43:43.360 --> 43:45.610
Get behind me!

43:46.860 --> 43:50.484
You travel the path of Orpheus!

43:50.485 --> 43:51.734
Yes, we do!

43:51.735 --> 43:55.735
Then, know the fate of Orpheus!

44:00.027 --> 44:03.276
Get it? This is the fate
of Orpheus. I'm still alive.

44:03.277 --> 44:06.777
- This mech is pretty tits, right?
- Huh?

44:15.527 --> 44:17.776
Wait, you're Orpheus?

44:17.777 --> 44:21.484
I've spent my whole life dreaming of
the day I could finally meet you.

44:21.485 --> 44:23.193
Well, that's very flattering,

44:23.194 --> 44:25.609
but I try to be upfront
with all my groupies.

44:25.610 --> 44:27.568
I'm not the marrying type.

44:27.569 --> 44:30.151
No, we've come to rescue you.

44:30.152 --> 44:32.652
You can rescue my sperm
from my testes.

44:34.777 --> 44:36.276
You guys want to see my digs?

44:36.277 --> 44:39.818
Fuck and yes together equals
"fuck, yes"!

44:39.819 --> 44:41.693
Then, fucking yes it is.
Let's do this.

44:41.694 --> 44:44.401
Orpheus! Nice to meet you.
I'm Augie.

44:44.402 --> 44:47.234
I put skittles in my cereal.

44:47.235 --> 44:49.193
Who is this mushy man?

44:49.194 --> 44:51.859
We were told you're an expert
at getting mortals out of hell.

44:51.860 --> 44:54.276
Who told you that?

44:54.277 --> 44:56.193
Is that true?

44:56.194 --> 44:58.401
- You're really gonna kill me?
- Yeah.

44:58.402 --> 45:00.318
I thought we had a good thing
going on here.

45:00.319 --> 45:02.818
- We were just bro-ing out.
- We were.

45:02.819 --> 45:06.776
But it says here that you made
a blood oath, and you broke it.

45:06.777 --> 45:09.859
- Seriously, a blood oath?
- Yeah, it was dumb.

45:09.860 --> 45:14.568
Nobody does blood oaths anymore. Not
since that guy fucked a monkey.

45:14.569 --> 45:19.609
Well, I... -You promised somebody a
breath mint and you reneged. Really?

45:19.610 --> 45:23.859
That is lame.

45:23.860 --> 45:26.984
But also punishable by death
and an eternity in hell.

45:26.985 --> 45:30.359
Damn! Seriously,
there's nothing you can do?

45:30.360 --> 45:34.318
If you'd given him a mint back,
you wouldn't even be here.

45:34.319 --> 45:38.193
With my ideas for hell, I'm worth a
lot more to you alive than dead.

45:38.194 --> 45:42.401
Well, you got a point.
Hm, options, possibilities.

45:42.402 --> 45:46.151
You know, I could give another mortal
to the demons union, spare your life.

45:46.152 --> 45:48.318
That's great!
What can I do to repay you?

45:48.319 --> 45:53.109
Why don't you help me to make
this sacrifice a huge event?

45:53.110 --> 46:01.110
A spectacle so big that it might
even impress a certain angel.

46:01.319 --> 46:02.651
- Deal.
- Deal.

46:02.652 --> 46:05.109
That's it? Thank you, devil.

46:05.110 --> 46:10.109
Actually, I'm going to need you to
sign and initial this and this.

46:10.110 --> 46:12.068
It's a non-disclosure agreement.

46:12.069 --> 46:14.568
Oh, and anyone working here
under my employ needs

46:14.569 --> 46:16.151
to pass a urine test.

46:16.152 --> 46:18.109
We just did drugs together
like an hour ago.

46:18.110 --> 46:22.027
I know. I just kind of
wanted your piss. -Oh.

46:27.902 --> 46:29.859
Down here!

46:29.860 --> 46:33.194
No way, that's so rad!

46:39.152 --> 46:41.026
Hey, is that a pogo stick?

46:41.027 --> 46:43.984
It sure is, Bromeo.
150 jumps yesterday.

46:43.985 --> 46:45.151
Give it up, no breaks.

46:45.152 --> 46:47.568
- What, what?
- Yeah, yeah!

46:47.569 --> 46:50.401
Wait, I thought you said
pogo sticks are for pussies.

46:50.402 --> 46:53.401
- You said what about a pogo stick?
- Um...

46:53.402 --> 46:55.568
You said the pogo stick
was a dick,

46:55.569 --> 46:58.609
and only a pussy would need to jump
up and down on it over and over.

46:58.610 --> 47:03.484
No, I didn't say pogo sticks,
I said hobo dicks.

47:03.485 --> 47:04.984
Why is this woman lying?

47:04.985 --> 47:08.276
He's a fat little lesbian
that lies.

47:08.277 --> 47:09.609
I like pogo sticks.

47:09.610 --> 47:11.443
I would never disrespect
a pogo stick.

47:11.444 --> 47:14.776
This is what you've been doing
for the last 2,000 years?

47:14.777 --> 47:16.901
You've been down here
playing with toys.

47:16.902 --> 47:20.276
Check that as a yes.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

47:20.277 --> 47:23.401
No, thank you, Charon.
We're fine.

47:23.402 --> 47:25.568
That guy thinks his boats
are the shit.

47:25.569 --> 47:27.568
The wood is rotting.

47:27.569 --> 47:30.651
It's a boat only fit
for illegal immigrants.

47:30.652 --> 47:34.984
I wish he'd just row back
to Cuba!

47:34.985 --> 47:37.651
Remy rems,
check out my skills, yo.

47:37.652 --> 47:39.734
Hell, yeah, man!

47:39.735 --> 47:42.484
- Wow!
- Pretty cool, huh? That's me.

47:42.485 --> 47:45.735
- She looks pretty hot.
- Look how hot I am.

47:47.444 --> 47:49.276
That's incredible, man.
You painted that?

47:49.277 --> 47:51.859
I painted it and posed for it
at the same time.

47:51.860 --> 47:54.401
How do you even physically
do that? You're amazing.

47:54.402 --> 47:56.109
Remy, I am just like you.

47:56.110 --> 47:59.359
I put my underwear
on one ball at a time.

47:59.360 --> 48:00.818
When did you learn to paint?

48:00.819 --> 48:02.901
The moment I was born,
I came out of the womb,

48:02.902 --> 48:07.277
and I quickly turned around, and
I painted my mother's vagina.

48:09.569 --> 48:12.984
You guys like the lyre?

48:12.985 --> 48:15.026
- Is that like a guitar?
- I don't know.

48:15.027 --> 48:18.651
Does a guitar increase the gravity
of a pair of women's panties?

48:18.652 --> 48:20.526
Mm-hm.

48:20.527 --> 48:22.526
I could make a tree
bone me with this thing.

48:22.527 --> 48:28.026
And the trees will bone you
here, so be careful.

48:28.027 --> 48:31.193
Yeah, that sounds good.
A tree will fuck me?

48:31.194 --> 48:33.193
When I was a small boy,

48:33.194 --> 48:36.151
I was walking through a forest,
and a tree tried to overpower me.

48:36.152 --> 48:38.193
Ah, really? What did you do?

48:38.194 --> 48:39.693
He pushed me on the ground

48:39.694 --> 48:41.901
and wrapped his leaves
around my face and arms,

48:41.902 --> 48:45.859
and then, the next thing I knew,
a branch was penetrating my ass.

48:45.860 --> 48:48.276
Oh, god!

48:48.277 --> 48:50.651
It was a pointy, pointy branch.

48:50.652 --> 48:53.401
I mean, did he wear,
like, a leaf condom or anything?

48:53.402 --> 48:56.193
No, just bark.

48:56.194 --> 49:00.902
When he was done, he shed his
acorns upon my back.

49:02.652 --> 49:06.151
Oh, that's the worst thing
I've ever heard.

49:06.152 --> 49:12.068
Um, Orpheus, what were you wearing
when the tree violated you?

49:12.069 --> 49:13.526
You think I asked for it?

49:13.527 --> 49:15.651
Were you maybe dressed
like a bush?

49:15.652 --> 49:18.026
I was dressed
like a human being!

49:18.027 --> 49:19.734
All right, I'm sorry.

49:19.735 --> 49:22.318
I'm gonna go and start a shelter
for tree rape victims.

49:22.319 --> 49:24.818
It's not a joke!

49:24.819 --> 49:27.359
Mr. Orpheus,
why have you stayed here

49:27.360 --> 49:28.901
if you could leave at any time?

49:28.902 --> 49:31.984
Especially with trees
like my uncle Carl.

49:31.985 --> 49:33.776
Well, me and my road Dawgs

49:33.777 --> 49:36.318
used to come down here
all the time rescuing virgins,

49:36.319 --> 49:38.859
and they'd say,
"oh, wassup now, gangsta?

49:38.860 --> 49:41.068
Let me thank you
with my lady parts."

49:41.069 --> 49:42.609
"Well, if I must."

49:42.610 --> 49:44.526
"Oh, by the way,
this baby's yours."

49:44.527 --> 49:46.818
And then I'm just like,
"I'm outta here, Missy!"

49:46.819 --> 49:50.943
Responsibilities,
that shit is zombiewalk, man.

49:50.944 --> 49:53.401
I'm like black people.
I'll take freedom.

49:53.402 --> 49:55.984
Preacher, meet the choir.

49:55.985 --> 49:59.234
Wow, Orpheus. Don't you ever
get lonely down here?

49:59.235 --> 50:02.151
You must have once wished
you had a family, right?

50:02.152 --> 50:03.776
Guess what? No.

50:03.777 --> 50:06.068
Fun times
we're all having together.

50:06.069 --> 50:08.318
You know what else would be fun?
Finding curt.

50:08.319 --> 50:10.401
It's the reason
we came down here.

50:10.402 --> 50:13.026
Fine. Whatevs.

50:13.027 --> 50:14.984
I can get you
wherever you wanna go.

50:14.985 --> 50:16.526
But first, you must pass

50:16.527 --> 50:23.651
the trials of the mortals!

50:23.652 --> 50:29.693
Well, I hope you all are ready
for a physical challenge.

50:29.694 --> 50:31.484
Who wants to see how good I am?

50:31.485 --> 50:33.401
- Um...
- Yes, okay.

50:33.402 --> 50:36.234
Moving, moving,
breathing very hard.

50:36.235 --> 50:39.151
Super strong. Super speed.

50:39.152 --> 50:41.526
Watch me fucking leap so high!

50:41.527 --> 50:46.234
Stuck it! I can leap
and fart at the same... oh!

50:46.235 --> 50:47.484
Fuck me!

50:47.485 --> 50:50.859
Oh, it hurts so bad. I'm weak.

50:50.860 --> 50:52.609
You know what,
you guys are good.

50:52.610 --> 50:58.818
Everyone passed, a-pluses,
thank you.

50:58.819 --> 51:02.359
Warriors, I've tested
your mind and body.

51:02.360 --> 51:04.443
Now, the hardest test of all.

51:04.444 --> 51:09.026
You must resist that which
tears all mortal men apart.

51:09.027 --> 51:11.359
Women.

51:11.360 --> 51:14.151
In a minute, a super hot, sexy bitch
is going to come through that door

51:14.152 --> 51:17.443
and try to seduce you into
telling her the secret word.

51:17.444 --> 51:21.109
She will stop at absolutely
nothing to get it out of you.

51:21.110 --> 51:23.943
You will want to fuck her silly.
Trust me.

51:23.944 --> 51:26.984
No matter what she does, no
matter how long she fucks you,

51:26.985 --> 51:29.109
do not give her the secret word.

51:29.110 --> 51:32.151
I repeat, do not give it to her.

51:32.152 --> 51:34.902
The secret word is "Jasmine".

51:43.694 --> 51:47.984
Whoo hoo! Boys, who wants
to take their ball sacks

51:47.985 --> 51:49.818
and put them in my mouth?

51:49.819 --> 51:57.485
Jasmine! Jasmine!
Jasmine! Jasmine!

51:59.694 --> 52:01.859
You all failed
to resist her charms.

52:01.860 --> 52:07.109
I was watching from a remote
monitor in the other room.

52:07.110 --> 52:08.901
But you can all move on.

52:08.902 --> 52:10.401
Back to my Tiki bar!

52:10.402 --> 52:12.234
- Yes!
- All right!

52:12.235 --> 52:16.651
The one that I built out of that
tree that sodomized me.

52:16.652 --> 52:18.693
Didn't we pass?
I don't understand.

52:18.694 --> 52:23.068
I can't believe I've spent my
entire life looking for this loser.

52:23.069 --> 52:25.234
I just need to find out
one thing for sure,

52:25.235 --> 52:27.151
and then I can
put this behind me.

52:27.152 --> 52:30.609
Wait. What?

52:30.610 --> 52:33.651
Garçon, these men need
some victory juice

52:33.652 --> 52:36.109
to pour down our head holes.

52:36.110 --> 52:37.401
Let's make a toast.

52:37.402 --> 52:38.818
To rescuing curt!

52:38.819 --> 52:40.651
No. To all the road dogs

52:40.652 --> 52:43.776
who had the courage
to leave their pregnant wives.

52:43.777 --> 52:45.984
Yeah, fuck them ho's.

52:45.985 --> 52:48.526
Orpheus, I bet you like
all flavor bitches.

52:48.527 --> 52:53.193
The fuck I do. Chinese, Asian,
Korean, pan-Asian, pan-Korean.

52:53.194 --> 52:54.443
Goo goo Gai pan.

52:54.444 --> 52:56.901
- That's a Cantonese dinner dish.
- Yeah.

52:56.902 --> 52:59.276
You'd fuck
a Cantonese dinner dish?

52:59.277 --> 53:02.818
- Um... yes.
- Well, then. Cool.

53:02.819 --> 53:06.568
- But no fat bitches.
- No!

53:06.569 --> 53:08.193
Deema.

53:08.194 --> 53:10.193
You're the coolest chick ever.
You're just like me.

53:10.194 --> 53:12.151
If you didn't have a pussy,
I'd think you were my son.

53:12.152 --> 53:14.568
And if you didn't have a pussy,
I'd think you were my dad.

53:14.569 --> 53:16.943
Oh, busted!

53:16.944 --> 53:21.443
Come on, Orpheus. Get on the real, real.
You never fucked a demon?

53:21.444 --> 53:25.943
Well, okay, there was just this one.
What was it like?

53:25.944 --> 53:28.776
So, we're in the bone zone,
I'm really finding my rhythm,

53:28.777 --> 53:30.734
and suddenly, she drops the,

53:30.735 --> 53:32.818
"oh, let's move into my cottage
made of tentacles."

53:32.819 --> 53:35.401
And I was like,
"peace out, man."

53:35.402 --> 53:39.443
I heard she really plumped up.
Twinkies just jumped into her mouth.

53:39.444 --> 53:41.609
- What was her name?
- Mm, I barely remember.

53:41.610 --> 53:46.443
I believe it was, hm...
Durmessa.

53:46.444 --> 53:48.859
Oh, shit, my face!

53:48.860 --> 53:51.109
You deadbeat dad.

53:51.110 --> 53:54.693
All this time I thought you were being
held captive against your will.

53:54.694 --> 53:58.693
I convinced myself
that is why you never came home.

53:58.694 --> 54:00.401
Wait, wait, Deema, let's talk.

54:00.402 --> 54:02.609
You're still gonna take us
to curt, right?

54:02.610 --> 54:03.776
I don't know where he is!

54:03.777 --> 54:05.984
Orpheus was supposed
to have all the answers.

54:05.985 --> 54:09.151
- You lied?
- Of course I lied.

54:09.152 --> 54:10.609
That's what demons do!

54:10.610 --> 54:12.401
What a purple bitch!

54:12.402 --> 54:13.943
How dare you say that to her!

54:13.944 --> 54:15.859
Someday she will
be my purple wife!

54:15.860 --> 54:18.318
- I told you she was a liar.
- Oh, yeah, that's right.

54:18.319 --> 54:20.026
Because you're smarter
than everybody.

54:20.027 --> 54:22.109
I'm Remy.
Look at my weird haircut.

54:22.110 --> 54:25.443
I wear a corduroy peacoat
and listen to dubstep music.

54:25.444 --> 54:27.234
Well, I'm tired of it.

54:27.235 --> 54:29.776
Women usually do that to me
after I make love to them.

54:29.777 --> 54:31.193
Augie!

54:31.194 --> 54:32.401
Fuck him, Remy.

54:32.402 --> 54:34.234
Let's watch my sweet-ass
flat screen.

54:34.235 --> 54:38.734
I have the entire
big momma's house trilogy.

54:38.735 --> 54:46.735
Deema!

54:48.152 --> 54:50.443
[]You're pathetic, you know that?

54:50.444 --> 54:52.651
- Yeah.
- Where are you even going?

54:52.652 --> 54:55.151
Nowhere.
I was just looking for you.

54:55.152 --> 54:58.151
I still think we can make
a great "teama".

54:58.152 --> 55:00.734
I don't know why
you still believe in me.

55:00.735 --> 55:03.776
I come from a lying demon
and a selfish mortal.

55:03.777 --> 55:05.068
Doesn't change who you are.

55:05.069 --> 55:06.901
My dad's like a big jerk,

55:06.902 --> 55:09.276
and my mom lied to him
about being a woman.

55:09.277 --> 55:13.443
Okay, I don't know
what to do with that, Augie,

55:13.444 --> 55:16.651
but thanks for giving me
another chance.

55:16.652 --> 55:22.568
Get in.

55:22.569 --> 55:24.444
Whoa. Ahh.

55:27.527 --> 55:30.693
- Twitter alert from the demon union.
- What does it say?

55:30.694 --> 55:34.734
It's a reminder to tune in and
watch the mortal sacrifice tonight

55:34.735 --> 55:36.359
at the crossroads.

55:36.360 --> 55:38.609
That's where
they're gonna sacrifice curt!

55:38.610 --> 55:43.569
Do you know how to get there? -Yeah.
It's really close to here.

55:44.902 --> 55:46.526
Big momma,
you fooled them again.

55:46.527 --> 55:48.109
Would you fuck big momma?

55:48.110 --> 55:49.568
Yes. Would you?

55:49.569 --> 55:52.943
Bro-dawg, I've fucked every
woman I've ever met.

55:52.944 --> 55:55.276
Except for that smoking
angel, Barb.

55:55.277 --> 55:58.276
- She's the one that got away.
- What happened?

55:58.277 --> 56:01.234
She just wanted
to be stupid friends.

56:01.235 --> 56:04.609
I don't need friends anymore. You
know what I mean? I need bros.

56:04.610 --> 56:06.984
- Yeah.
- You know what I'm saying, man.

56:06.985 --> 56:09.276
Wake up, see my bros
in the bunk bed above me.

56:09.277 --> 56:11.693
Play video games,
then we order some ZA.

56:11.694 --> 56:13.901
We eat it
with all of our bros together,

56:13.902 --> 56:15.651
high-fiving after each bite.

56:15.652 --> 56:17.068
Then we all take
a shit together.

56:17.069 --> 56:18.943
You have a bathroom
with five toilets.

56:18.944 --> 56:21.359
Everyone making eye contact
while reading Maxim.

56:21.360 --> 56:23.193
And the next day,
we do the same thing.

56:23.194 --> 56:25.401
It's the way of the bro,
like you said.

56:25.402 --> 56:29.276
Well, your way of the bro is a little
different than mine. But I hear you.

56:29.277 --> 56:33.484
Coming up tonight from quick-jet
printer replacement cartridge stadium,

56:33.485 --> 56:35.943
Shirtz 'n' Skinz
perform their latest single.

56:35.944 --> 56:41.109
Later, mortal curt Meyers
will be sacrificed live.

56:41.110 --> 56:42.318
Shit! Curt!

56:42.319 --> 56:43.359
Wassup?

56:43.360 --> 56:45.818
- We got to go.
- Go where, brah?

56:45.819 --> 56:48.234
- Orpheus, we got to save curt.
- Huh?

56:48.235 --> 56:50.901
Come on. That's what you do,
you rescue mortals from hell!

56:50.902 --> 56:55.193
I ain't that guy anymore.
That's a young man's game.

56:55.194 --> 56:57.984
What do you say?
One last mission?

56:57.985 --> 57:01.401
Sorry. -Well, then, I
got to go on my own.

57:01.402 --> 57:05.193
Why? He's not your friend, man. I'm
your friend. You just said it.

57:05.194 --> 57:07.943
You wanted to bro out and stare
at each other on toilets.

57:07.944 --> 57:10.109
I'm sorry, brother.

57:10.110 --> 57:13.068
I guess I'm gonna go set
five mirrors up in my bathroom

57:13.069 --> 57:20.318
and stare at myself
as I make the forbidden mud.

57:20.319 --> 57:22.484
To the crossroads!

57:22.485 --> 57:26.193
Pretend you're rowing
to Florida!

57:26.194 --> 57:33.776
Of course his boat has a hole
in it. What a loser.

57:33.777 --> 57:34.984
Augie!

57:34.985 --> 57:37.068
Hey, Augie!

57:37.069 --> 57:38.818
Hey, Deema, what's going on?

57:38.819 --> 57:41.609
Augie, curt's gonna be
sacrificed! We have to save him!

57:41.610 --> 57:44.359
We're handling it.
Thank you for your interest.

57:44.360 --> 57:50.443
Um... why don't you guys
get in my boat?

57:50.444 --> 57:55.651
Look, man, I know I was a dick.
Just get in.

57:55.652 --> 58:00.234
Fine. You want me to say it?
I suppose you earned it.

58:00.235 --> 58:01.859
I...

58:01.860 --> 58:03.109
I love you, man.

58:03.110 --> 58:04.776
I never realized
how great my friends are

58:04.777 --> 58:08.234
until I had that stupid thought
that I didn't.

58:08.235 --> 58:09.776
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
middle part,

58:09.777 --> 58:11.234
you know,
I haven't made it easy on you,

58:11.235 --> 58:13.109
took you for granted, big close.

58:13.110 --> 58:15.401
I'll never make
this mistake again.

58:15.402 --> 58:17.318
Mm-mm.

58:17.319 --> 58:21.359
I really need you, dude.
I can't do this on my own.

58:21.360 --> 58:24.568
You need me?

58:24.569 --> 58:25.569
Yup.

58:35.027 --> 58:43.027
To the crossroads!

58:43.985 --> 58:45.651
You're on in one minute!

58:45.652 --> 58:48.276
Damn! I hate public speaking.
Anyone got a Xanax?

58:48.277 --> 58:51.526
Hey, hell is ours.
We own this place. Am I right?

58:51.527 --> 58:54.276
Right. Right. I'm the devil.

58:54.277 --> 58:57.068
Get out there on that stage
and start struttin' that shit.

58:57.069 --> 58:59.651
- Yeah!
- Hail, Satan!

58:59.652 --> 59:02.193
I give you the devil!

59:02.194 --> 59:04.943
Oh, and, curt, we couldn't
find any other mortal,

59:04.944 --> 59:07.026
so we have
to sacrifice you. Sorry.

59:07.027 --> 59:10.151
Whoa, that's bullshit!
Hold on! Wait, wait, wait!

59:10.152 --> 59:11.526
Hurts me more than it...

59:11.527 --> 59:13.234
Okay, thanks, bye.

59:13.235 --> 59:16.735
I'm fucked!

59:18.944 --> 59:21.443
Usa! Usa!

59:21.444 --> 59:24.901
Usa! Usa! Usa!

59:24.902 --> 59:26.943
Devil! Devil!

59:26.944 --> 59:29.818
Switch it up! Oh, come on.

59:29.819 --> 59:31.818
Devil! Us...

59:31.819 --> 59:35.651
We are about
to meet our sacrifice!

59:35.652 --> 59:38.484
He's not just
your average oathbreaker!

59:38.485 --> 59:40.443
He's a friendship forsaker!

59:40.444 --> 59:44.193
Ow! Ow! You can't do this to me.

59:44.194 --> 59:45.443
Why not?

59:45.444 --> 59:48.818
Because we made a deal,
remember?

59:48.819 --> 59:50.609
Let me read it.

59:50.610 --> 59:54.318
Uh-huh. Boilerplate.
Latin. Legalese.

59:54.319 --> 59:55.693
Read it out loud!

59:55.694 --> 59:57.943
"I will not sacrifice curt

59:57.944 --> 01:00:01.443
if he helps me put on a real special
show to impress Barb the angel."

01:00:01.444 --> 01:00:02.651
A-ha!

01:00:02.652 --> 01:00:04.318
- Bullshit!
- What the hell?

01:00:04.319 --> 01:00:06.484
You're right.
It's all right here.

01:00:06.485 --> 01:00:08.818
Oh! That is beautiful!

01:00:08.819 --> 01:00:10.234
- Curt?
- Yeah?

01:00:10.235 --> 01:00:13.776
When is a contract
not a contract?

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:17.734
When it's eaten!

01:00:17.735 --> 01:00:25.401
Devil, you are a piece of shit.

01:00:25.402 --> 01:00:29.609
I guess your contract
is now null and void.

01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:32.484
Oh! Oh!

01:00:32.485 --> 01:00:35.359
You all right there, devil?
Sound a little gassy.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:38.359
Almost feels like I ate
a bad burrito or something.

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.734
Not good.

01:00:40.735 --> 01:00:44.568
Look at him. -Demons,
continue with the sacrifice.

01:00:44.569 --> 01:00:47.234
Stomach, let me
introduce you to toilet.

01:00:47.235 --> 01:00:49.235
You two should get along great.

01:00:52.735 --> 01:00:56.651
Hey! Ow!

01:00:56.652 --> 01:01:00.652
Get off me, man!
Ow! Guys! Come on! Aw, shit!

01:01:11.277 --> 01:01:12.901
Those demons want blood.

01:01:12.902 --> 01:01:14.943
I know how this song ends.

01:01:14.944 --> 01:01:18.568
No! They're gonna kill him.
How do we get past those guards?

01:01:18.569 --> 01:01:20.109
- Hey!
- I got this one.

01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:27.569
There's nothing hornier
than a demon in hell.

01:02:13.194 --> 01:02:14.401
Curt!

01:02:14.402 --> 01:02:17.568
- Hey! Help me!
- Curt!

01:02:17.569 --> 01:02:20.943
Wait, what? Guys! How the fuck
did you get down here?

01:02:20.944 --> 01:02:22.318
We came down to save you!

01:02:22.319 --> 01:02:24.109
Yo, what up?

01:02:24.110 --> 01:02:26.151
- There's my sweet baby boy!
- Hey!

01:02:26.152 --> 01:02:27.443
Oh, mama missed you!

01:02:27.444 --> 01:02:29.401
- Easy, Augie.
- Who's she?

01:02:29.402 --> 01:02:31.568
The devil's coming back!

01:02:31.569 --> 01:02:33.609
The devil's gonna sacrifice me!
You got to get me out of here!

01:02:33.610 --> 01:02:35.151
All right. Let's go.

01:02:35.152 --> 01:02:41.693
Nobody mention anything
about his diarrhea!

01:02:41.694 --> 01:02:44.651
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Uh...

01:02:44.652 --> 01:02:46.277
- Lake of fire!
- Lake of fire!

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:54.609
Help! -Remy, no, no, no!
Hold on, Remy!

01:02:54.610 --> 01:02:56.318
Yeah! I'm back!

01:02:56.319 --> 01:02:58.193
Keep the fan on in there.

01:02:58.194 --> 01:03:01.026
Well, well,
what do we have here?

01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:04.651
Um, can we get that bridge back?

01:03:04.652 --> 01:03:07.484
If you answer yes
to any of these questions,

01:03:07.485 --> 01:03:09.693
you may have
an enlarged prostate.

01:03:09.694 --> 01:03:11.943
- Do you have difficulty urinating?
- Yes.

01:03:11.944 --> 01:03:13.443
- Weak stream?
- Yes.

01:03:13.444 --> 01:03:14.818
- Dribbling?
- Yes.

01:03:14.819 --> 01:03:16.984
- Painful urination?
- Yes.

01:03:16.985 --> 01:03:19.443
- Pussy, yellow discharge?
- Yes.

01:03:19.444 --> 01:03:21.318
If you answered yes
to all of these questions,

01:03:21.319 --> 01:03:24.151
- go immediately to the hospital.
- No.

01:03:24.152 --> 01:03:27.151
Okay. In addition to one mortal,

01:03:27.152 --> 01:03:31.693
we are also going to sacrifice
the daughter of Orpheus. Zing!

01:03:31.694 --> 01:03:36.318
My daughter! -Chew on that, Orphy!
Mm-hm. Tough beans.

01:03:36.319 --> 01:03:39.818
Oh, shit. I've got to save her!

01:03:39.819 --> 01:03:46.026
Oh, fuck me. And I'm off.

01:03:46.027 --> 01:03:48.651
- Where the hell is my phone?
- Extra order of dipping sauce.

01:03:48.652 --> 01:03:50.234
- Give me that!
- And I would like a...

01:03:50.235 --> 01:03:54.193
Oh, god! Oh,
but I gave them my credit card!

01:03:54.194 --> 01:03:58.984
I told you to stop calling me.

01:03:58.985 --> 01:04:01.193
I know, I know,
but I thought you'd like to know

01:04:01.194 --> 01:04:04.651
that I found the two mortals
you were looking for.

01:04:04.652 --> 01:04:07.609
No way. You're just saying this
to get me to come down there.

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:09.568
Oh, no, I promise it's true.

01:04:09.569 --> 01:04:12.068
How do I know? Prove it!

01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:14.859
You know what? I'll take a picture
with my phone and send it to you.

01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:17.860
And there, and sending.

01:04:19.235 --> 01:04:20.776
What?

01:04:20.777 --> 01:04:23.359
- It's a dick pic.
- Sorry, wrong picture.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.318
Sending.

01:04:25.319 --> 01:04:28.193
Oh, my, devil.
It is the mortals.

01:04:28.194 --> 01:04:30.609
I said I would find them
for you, and I did.

01:04:30.610 --> 01:04:34.193
I'll be right there. -Get ready
for some sweet devil loving!

01:04:34.194 --> 01:04:36.943
Hello?

01:04:36.944 --> 01:04:38.859
Shirtz 'n' Skinz, you're next.

01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:40.694
Last rehearsal!

01:04:46.985 --> 01:04:49.109
She's my angel

01:04:49.110 --> 01:04:51.443
angel - angel

01:04:51.444 --> 01:04:54.776
she is my angel

01:04:54.777 --> 01:04:56.443
she's my angel

01:04:56.444 --> 01:04:59.109
angel - angel

01:04:59.110 --> 01:05:00.359
yeah!

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:01.651
I'm a big fan.

01:05:01.652 --> 01:05:04.359
- That's great, man. Super cool.
- Yes.

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.109
Want me to sign something
for you?

01:05:06.110 --> 01:05:08.943
Will you autograph
my fist with your face?

01:05:08.944 --> 01:05:11.068
- Aw, sure, man.
- Hy-ah!

01:05:11.069 --> 01:05:15.401
God. Oh, shit, god, fuck me.

01:05:15.402 --> 01:05:18.401
I came by to inform you that the
concert has been rescheduled.

01:05:18.402 --> 01:05:21.568
The good news is you're all
still getting paid and laid.

01:05:21.569 --> 01:05:23.109
- Cool.
- Yes.

01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:25.443
Oh, fellas,
please leave your costumes.

01:05:25.444 --> 01:05:28.151
And there is an assortment
of groupies waiting outside

01:05:28.152 --> 01:05:29.651
to suck your dicks.

01:05:29.652 --> 01:05:33.693
- Fuck, yeah, dog!
- Word.

01:05:33.694 --> 01:05:39.443
Okay, demons and damned,
before we sacrifice any mortals,

01:05:39.444 --> 01:05:43.693
I'd like to introduce to you
my favorite boy band,

01:05:43.694 --> 01:05:46.109
Shirtz 'n' Skinz!

01:05:46.110 --> 01:05:47.735
With a "z"!

01:05:50.110 --> 01:05:55.526
That's the way to do it!

01:05:55.527 --> 01:05:59.151
What? That's just Shirtz.
Where the fuck is Skinz?

01:05:59.152 --> 01:06:03.526
Look, I'm sorry. The rest
of the band is stuck in traffic.

01:06:03.527 --> 01:06:06.194
So I'm gonna rock
three times as hard!

01:06:09.735 --> 01:06:12.526
As a young boy I found solace

01:06:12.527 --> 01:06:15.651
in the forest wild and free

01:06:15.652 --> 01:06:19.026
'til that fateful day
youth was ripped away

01:06:19.027 --> 01:06:22.276
'neath the boughs
of an old oak tree

01:06:22.277 --> 01:06:25.609
he wrapped his leaves
around my fragile frame

01:06:25.610 --> 01:06:28.609
and thrust me to the grass

01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:30.109
how my face did Blanche

01:06:30.110 --> 01:06:35.527
as his mighty branch
did penetrate my ass

01:06:36.985 --> 01:06:39.026
now when a tree
comes in the forest

01:06:39.027 --> 01:06:42.318
tell me
do you think it makes a sound?

01:06:42.319 --> 01:06:45.901
No, you'll only hear the wail
of a broken tot

01:06:45.902 --> 01:06:51.276
lying butt up on the ground

01:06:51.277 --> 01:06:53.443
my life and ass both splintered

01:06:53.444 --> 01:06:57.026
and my sphincter torn and loose

01:06:57.027 --> 01:07:00.401
so I mourn for my lost innocence

01:07:00.402 --> 01:07:03.484
and for all that's pure and good

01:07:03.485 --> 01:07:06.651
and I mourn the day
I learned the painful meaning

01:07:06.652 --> 01:07:10.276
of mourning wood

01:07:10.277 --> 01:07:14.026
morning wood

01:07:14.027 --> 01:07:18.944
morning wood

01:07:28.902 --> 01:07:29.984
ha ha!

01:07:29.985 --> 01:07:32.068
What is this shit?

01:07:32.069 --> 01:07:37.484
Surprise, surprise! It is I!

01:07:37.485 --> 01:07:41.484
Orpheus? -You thought I was someone
else, but I'm not someone else.

01:07:41.485 --> 01:07:45.193
I'm Orpheus, the guy
that you didn't think I was

01:07:45.194 --> 01:07:46.693
but I am now.

01:07:46.694 --> 01:07:48.818
Yeah, I get it,
that's called a disguise.

01:07:48.819 --> 01:07:50.484
You put it on,
I thought you were someone else.

01:07:50.485 --> 01:07:51.859
No more explaining.

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:53.568
I can't believe you made it!

01:07:53.569 --> 01:07:56.026
Yeah, you said you were retiring
from saving mortals.

01:07:56.027 --> 01:07:59.318
I did. But I never said
anything about retiring

01:07:59.319 --> 01:08:01.484
from saving half-mortals.

01:08:01.485 --> 01:08:04.109
Really?
You came back here for me?

01:08:04.110 --> 01:08:07.234
Yes. Look, I know I wasn't
the best father,

01:08:07.235 --> 01:08:09.359
and I wasn't around for you,

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.568
and I really regret that.

01:08:11.569 --> 01:08:14.943
Aw, dad, that's so sweet
of you to say.

01:08:14.944 --> 01:08:18.193
Yes. Mmm. Sweet lips.

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:19.943
Oh, oh, this isn't that.

01:08:19.944 --> 01:08:23.568
Oh, I may have slightly
misread that situation.

01:08:23.569 --> 01:08:24.984
Yeah.

01:08:24.984 --> 01:08:27.234
We haven't actually
done a DNA test,

01:08:27.234 --> 01:08:30.401
so there's still a possibility that
this isn't totally disgusting.

01:08:30.402 --> 01:08:31.818
No.

01:08:31.819 --> 01:08:33.943
No matter. I love you, daughter.

01:08:33.944 --> 01:08:40.193
Okay, let's get out of hell.

01:08:40.194 --> 01:08:46.401
- Everybody on!
- What? Oh!

01:08:46.402 --> 01:08:54.402
Give me that!

01:08:57.569 --> 01:08:59.651
Ha ha! I win!

01:08:59.652 --> 01:09:02.527
It's time for,
Bam, the sacrifice!

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:05.734
Crucify 'em!

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:17.026
Ahh.

01:09:17.027 --> 01:09:20.984
Barb, the one that got away.

01:09:23.777 --> 01:09:28.484
Oh, yeah! Slutty angel.

01:09:28.484 --> 01:09:32.943
She's on the wrong side of 40.

01:09:32.944 --> 01:09:37.943
Mama.

01:09:37.944 --> 01:09:45.069
Wish I was that pole.

01:09:47.069 --> 01:09:49.568
Look, here's your mortals.

01:09:49.569 --> 01:09:52.984
Orpheus, that song
about getting raped by trees,

01:09:52.984 --> 01:09:57.651
it was so beautiful
and personal.

01:09:57.652 --> 01:09:59.651
You're such a sensitive artist.

01:09:59.652 --> 01:10:02.610
Barb, I'm a sensitive
artist, too.

01:10:03.819 --> 01:10:05.984
What the hell?

01:10:05.985 --> 01:10:08.568
Look at the painting
I did of you.

01:10:08.569 --> 01:10:10.859
It's a black-light painting.

01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:12.027
Of me on a dune buggy.

01:10:15.194 --> 01:10:18.776
Aw, geez, Louise!

01:10:18.777 --> 01:10:21.401
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

01:10:21.402 --> 01:10:24.152
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

01:10:26.985 --> 01:10:29.109
Orpheus isn't going down easy!

01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:31.234
Here she is.

01:10:31.235 --> 01:10:34.068
We need more ammunition.

01:10:34.069 --> 01:10:35.943
You're not gonna to kill him,
are you?

01:10:35.944 --> 01:10:39.026
- Start folding t-shirts.
- You're scaring...

01:10:39.027 --> 01:10:42.234
Uh-huh.

01:10:42.235 --> 01:10:46.359
Darling, I've traveled
many, many miles to find you.

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:48.068
- You have?
- Yes.

01:10:48.069 --> 01:10:50.109
I've tried to fight off
my feelings,

01:10:50.110 --> 01:10:52.484
but the head can't tell
the heart where to go.

01:10:52.485 --> 01:10:56.818
What do you say? You, me, and my penis
get hitched and fly off into the sunset!

01:10:56.819 --> 01:10:59.318
- Aww.
- The only thing that matters is,

01:10:59.319 --> 01:11:03.693
Barb, do you want to spend
the rest of our life together?

01:11:03.694 --> 01:11:09.776
They all said that
our love stood not a chance

01:11:09.777 --> 01:11:15.318
that our hearts could never
keep it in their pants

01:11:15.319 --> 01:11:19.484
but when my penis
saw your sweet vagina

01:11:19.485 --> 01:11:21.484
standing across the room

01:11:21.485 --> 01:11:23.401
what is this, Jersey boys?

01:11:23.402 --> 01:11:26.151
My scrotum did a backflip

01:11:26.152 --> 01:11:28.943
and my lonely balls did swoon

01:11:28.944 --> 01:11:32.443
- I hate musicals.
- Mama Mia! Wasn't bad.

01:11:32.444 --> 01:11:38.693
Now it's clear
that this love was meant to be

01:11:38.694 --> 01:11:39.776
my vagina

01:11:39.777 --> 01:11:41.234
my penis

01:11:41.235 --> 01:11:45.193
you and me - stop singing!

01:11:45.194 --> 01:11:47.401
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, no!

01:11:47.402 --> 01:11:50.026
- The demons want blood!
- We got to get out of here now!

01:11:50.027 --> 01:11:52.443
- Hurry up!
- Grab a fistful of white!

01:11:52.444 --> 01:11:53.818
Hold on!

01:11:53.819 --> 01:11:56.734
Load me up!

01:11:56.735 --> 01:11:58.901
- Wait for me!
- Augie!

01:11:58.902 --> 01:12:01.609
- Barb, you got to go back.
- Grab on, tubby!

01:12:01.610 --> 01:12:04.693
- You don't have to call me that!
- Reach with your sausage fingers!

01:12:04.694 --> 01:12:07.526
Come on, honey! -Pretend we're
made out of cookie dough!

01:12:07.527 --> 01:12:10.401
- I got it!
- Go!

01:12:10.402 --> 01:12:14.359
Die, Orpheus.

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:18.901
Look out!

01:12:18.902 --> 01:12:20.859
Oh, shit! Barb!

01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:23.359
Fucking t-shirts!

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:25.984
No!

01:12:25.985 --> 01:12:28.443
- We're gaining speed!
- We got to wake her up!

01:12:28.444 --> 01:12:32.109
- Oh, she's out cold!
- Barb, wake up!

01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:33.776
Do something, Remy!

01:12:33.777 --> 01:12:36.776
Slap her harder.
Try the back of your hand.

01:12:36.777 --> 01:12:38.944
Oh, no!

01:12:47.194 --> 01:12:48.444
Oh, fuck me.

01:13:00.527 --> 01:13:02.276
What's that sound?

01:13:02.277 --> 01:13:05.443
It's a sex offender alert.

01:13:05.444 --> 01:13:09.152
- Cool app.
- Shh, quiet!

01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:21.068
Run!

01:13:21.069 --> 01:13:23.609
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:13:23.610 --> 01:13:26.359
Holy shit!
These trees are alive, man!

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:27.943
Careful down here.

01:13:27.944 --> 01:13:30.318
There are trees who think "no"
means "yes".

01:13:30.319 --> 01:13:37.068
- Just don't stop running!
- Wait, where's Barb?

01:13:37.069 --> 01:13:39.401
Help!

01:13:39.402 --> 01:13:40.901
Help!

01:13:40.902 --> 01:13:43.693
- I have to go back for Barb!
- Dad, no!

01:13:43.694 --> 01:13:46.359
We'll catch up to you!

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:49.193
There! Head for the cave!

01:13:49.194 --> 01:13:51.568
I'm coming, Barb! Hold on!

01:13:51.569 --> 01:13:53.859
Were you trying
to hit her, boss?

01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:57.359
I mean, you shot her
right between the eyes.

01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:01.068
She's probably fine.
She's an angel.

01:14:01.069 --> 01:14:04.193
It was a good shot
if you meant to hit her.

01:14:04.194 --> 01:14:06.943
Knock it off! Focus!

01:14:06.944 --> 01:14:11.693
What's that smell?

01:14:11.694 --> 01:14:15.776
True heroes. To have laid
such a costly sacrifice

01:14:15.777 --> 01:14:18.151
upon the altar of freedom.

01:14:18.152 --> 01:14:19.526
Yeah.

01:14:19.527 --> 01:14:23.151
But that's what you get
for chasing pussy.

01:14:23.152 --> 01:14:24.943
Ow! Stitching up your wing

01:14:24.944 --> 01:14:27.068
this is the stitching up
your wing song

01:14:27.069 --> 01:14:29.484
Barb! Look out!
Don't you touch her!

01:14:29.485 --> 01:14:32.068
What? No! I'm helping her!

01:14:32.069 --> 01:14:34.776
Oh, really?

01:14:34.777 --> 01:14:38.109
- Orpheus?
- Tree?

01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:46.110
You look familiar.

01:14:47.902 --> 01:14:51.068
Orpheus? Orpheus?

01:14:51.069 --> 01:14:53.276
Yeah, it's me, you diddler.

01:14:53.277 --> 01:14:55.526
I always hoped
I'd run into you someday.

01:14:55.527 --> 01:14:57.026
I bet you did.

01:14:57.027 --> 01:14:59.359
No, no, it's not like that.

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:02.068
I wanted to apologize
for what I did to you.

01:15:02.069 --> 01:15:04.526
"I'm sorry" is just not
going to cut it.

01:15:04.527 --> 01:15:07.151
- Did you ever get my gift basket?
- No.

01:15:07.152 --> 01:15:09.401
You're kidding?
I tracked the package.

01:15:09.402 --> 01:15:11.526
- Mm-hm.
- I understand your anger,

01:15:11.527 --> 01:15:14.026
but I've done a lot of work
in therapy to get better.

01:15:14.027 --> 01:15:17.776
Is there anything
I can do to make it right?

01:15:17.777 --> 01:15:21.901
When I find Orpheus, I'm gonna
mount his balls on a stick.

01:15:21.902 --> 01:15:25.985
There is one thing.

01:15:28.402 --> 01:15:32.193
Hey, tree!
Have you seen an angel?

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:36.609
- I did, yes.
- Well, where is she?

01:15:36.610 --> 01:15:38.234
Um...

01:15:38.235 --> 01:15:42.318
She went that way.

01:15:42.319 --> 01:15:46.068
Oh, okay. Well, good to see you.

01:15:46.069 --> 01:15:47.151
Keep growing.

01:15:47.152 --> 01:15:49.776
Yeah, keep growing, tree!

01:15:49.777 --> 01:15:51.526
What do you want me
to do to him?

01:15:51.527 --> 01:15:54.693
Shed your acorns
across his back.

01:15:54.694 --> 01:15:59.984
My psychologist is going
to kill me, but I'll do it.

01:15:59.985 --> 01:16:03.943
Let us escape to a secret place
where I can motorboat those wings.

01:16:03.944 --> 01:16:07.527
You're so dirty.

01:16:09.485 --> 01:16:11.443
Hey, does anybody want to stop

01:16:11.444 --> 01:16:13.444
for some red bull
and crystal meth smoothies?

01:16:16.735 --> 01:16:18.943
Oh, shit! Hold on!

01:16:18.944 --> 01:16:21.401
Like you didn't do last time!

01:16:21.402 --> 01:16:22.943
Quit squirming!

01:16:22.944 --> 01:16:30.735
Grab on! Pull! No!

01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:39.484
- Look, boss! Over there!
- Huh?

01:16:39.485 --> 01:16:42.359
- There's movement!
- Let's go!

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:44.068
What are you going to do to me?

01:16:44.069 --> 01:16:47.401
What do they want from me?

01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:49.901
No! No! No, no, no!

01:16:49.902 --> 01:16:52.984
I've got a pig in a blanket.

01:16:52.985 --> 01:16:55.818
Uh, that tree
is putting on lipstick.

01:16:55.819 --> 01:17:00.526
Curt! Deema! Remy!

01:17:00.527 --> 01:17:02.026
Are you fucking serious?

01:17:02.027 --> 01:17:04.068
I hope that's for marshmallows.

01:17:04.069 --> 01:17:05.984
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:17:05.985 --> 01:17:12.943
Hold on!

01:17:12.944 --> 01:17:15.318
Yes!

01:17:15.319 --> 01:17:19.318
Bull's-eye!

01:17:19.319 --> 01:17:21.109
What the fuck?

01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:28.444
This is my house.
You gonna screw with me?

01:17:38.402 --> 01:17:41.901
- You had a mint the whole time?
- What?

01:17:41.902 --> 01:17:44.068
- A mint!
- I didn't know it was there!

01:17:44.069 --> 01:17:46.693
It must have been stuck in
the lining of my shirt, I swear!

01:17:46.694 --> 01:17:49.901
Who gives a shit
about a stupid mint?

01:17:49.902 --> 01:17:51.901
- A mint?
- Huh?

01:17:51.902 --> 01:17:53.609
Don't let him eat that mint!

01:17:53.610 --> 01:17:57.609
Oh, shit! That's it, Remy!
Eat that mint!

01:17:57.610 --> 01:17:59.859
It's too late.
I don't want your mint now.

01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:02.484
No, no! It's not about that!
It'll reverse the curse.

01:18:02.485 --> 01:18:06.943
It'll get us out!
Quick, man, hurry up!

01:18:06.944 --> 01:18:10.276
- Get me that mint!
- Come on!

01:18:10.277 --> 01:18:15.026
- Put the whole thing in your mouth.
- Can't reach!

01:18:15.027 --> 01:18:17.401
- Eat it!
- Get your lips around that mint!

01:18:17.402 --> 01:18:19.318
I've tried my whole life!

01:18:19.319 --> 01:18:21.609
Gulp it down! -Take all
of it down your throat!

01:18:21.610 --> 01:18:24.651
- Make this sound when you do it...
- It helps!

01:18:24.652 --> 01:18:28.818
Tickle your balls!

01:18:28.819 --> 01:18:30.234
Demon, quick!

01:18:30.235 --> 01:18:32.152
- Remy, eat it! Eat it!
- Hurry up!

01:18:40.069 --> 01:18:42.901
Remy! Yeah, you did it, man!

01:18:42.902 --> 01:18:46.609
Yeah! I can touch my dick
with my tongue!

01:18:46.610 --> 01:18:49.484
- Hey, Remy, look!
- Huh?

01:18:49.485 --> 01:18:51.401
- Holy shit.
- What?

01:18:51.402 --> 01:18:54.984
Uh, that portal's
kind of scaring me, boss!

01:18:54.985 --> 01:18:58.651
Yeah, I'm thinking I just go back
up top and then call it a day.

01:18:58.652 --> 01:19:00.151
No! No!

01:19:00.152 --> 01:19:03.193
Whoa! Whoa!

01:19:03.194 --> 01:19:04.568
Augie! Hold on!

01:19:04.569 --> 01:19:08.651
- Grab him!
- Don't let go!

01:19:08.652 --> 01:19:10.068
No, no!

01:19:10.069 --> 01:19:12.151
Remy!

01:19:12.152 --> 01:19:15.443
- Wait, tell me where Barb is!
- Whoa!

01:19:15.444 --> 01:19:21.818
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Later, devil!

01:19:21.819 --> 01:19:23.985
Wait, wait! No, no!

01:19:30.027 --> 01:19:32.651
- Hello, devil.
- Huh?

01:19:32.652 --> 01:19:36.234
Care for some wine?

01:19:36.235 --> 01:19:37.943
No, thanks. I'm okay.

01:19:37.944 --> 01:19:39.651
It's an earthy Bordeaux,

01:19:39.652 --> 01:19:46.402
and it pairs wonderfully
with I'm going to rape you.

01:19:48.652 --> 01:19:50.776
Look, over there!

01:19:50.777 --> 01:19:53.818
It appears the better man
has won!

01:19:53.819 --> 01:19:57.193
Don't worry, you'll still
get a chance to be with her.

01:19:57.218 --> 01:19:58.318
I will?

01:19:58.319 --> 01:20:01.068
I'm going to go to walgreens
and buy a shitty devil mask

01:20:01.069 --> 01:20:02.776
and fuck her silly
while I wear it.

01:20:02.777 --> 01:20:05.484
Oh, don't! Oh, come on!

01:20:05.485 --> 01:20:07.955
Sorry, devil! I'm
a pretty package

01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:09.884
with an ugly gift inside.

01:20:18.277 --> 01:20:21.693
Hail Satan.

01:20:21.694 --> 01:20:24.318
Hail Satan.

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:26.319
Hail Satan.

01:20:32.735 --> 01:20:37.526
Holy shit! We're back!
I love this place!

01:20:37.527 --> 01:20:41.359
Oh, my god! We did it!

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:43.443
God, I miss the smell
of cotton candy!

01:20:43.444 --> 01:20:46.526
Augie, you have a syringe
stuck to your face.

01:20:46.527 --> 01:20:49.901
This place hasn't changed a bit.

01:20:49.902 --> 01:20:52.652
- Definitely an opiate.
- Wha...?!

01:20:54.319 --> 01:20:57.943
Where have you guys been? Cleb!

01:20:57.944 --> 01:20:59.651
Man, I'm happy to see you!

01:20:59.652 --> 01:21:02.401
What's going on here?
Whose treasure is this?

01:21:02.402 --> 01:21:07.026
This book is amazing.
The devil is the new Jesus.

01:21:07.027 --> 01:21:11.109
Who knew? Devil tears
sell better than dippin' dots.

01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:13.359
Remy, your idea worked!

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:15.818
Yes! Oh, my god, yes!

01:21:15.819 --> 01:21:22.027
We did it! What are we gonna
do with all this money?

01:22:40.319 --> 01:22:43.651
Let me just push this button to get
this escalator started up again.

01:22:43.652 --> 01:22:46.234
Thank you.

01:22:46.235 --> 01:22:49.859
Oh, yeah, that's right,
there's no button!

01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:52.193
- Hey, start walking.
- So just walk up to the top?

01:22:52.194 --> 01:22:54.734
Yeah! There's no motor
gonna help you out here.

01:22:54.735 --> 01:22:56.984
You're just going to walk up
that escalator.

01:22:56.985 --> 01:22:59.609
Is it something like it's a million
miles long, the escalator, or?

01:22:59.610 --> 01:23:01.818
A million miles long?
That's pretty good.

01:23:01.819 --> 01:23:04.276
That would be unpleasant. -Yeah,
that'd be real unpleasant.

01:23:04.277 --> 01:23:06.734
I only made it one story tall.

01:23:06.735 --> 01:23:08.901
Um.... But you're gonna walk it.

01:23:08.902 --> 01:23:11.943
Yeah!
You're walking that whole story.

01:23:11.944 --> 01:23:14.193
- Understood.
- All 27 steps.

01:23:14.194 --> 01:23:16.484
- All right, here I go.
- How do you like that, huh?

01:23:16.485 --> 01:23:18.318
Not the best, not the best.

01:23:18.319 --> 01:23:20.359
I would have preferred if the
escalator had been functioning.

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:28.360
Welcome to hell!

01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:30.693
- Hello again.
- Sit down.

01:23:30.694 --> 01:23:32.984
All right. Well, just here
in the booster seat?

01:23:32.985 --> 01:23:34.734
Yeah, like a baby.

01:23:34.735 --> 01:23:36.734
You're being punished
in your booster seat.

01:23:36.735 --> 01:23:38.359
It's uncomfortable,
I guess, a little bit.

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.609
Just sit there
like you're a crying baby.

01:23:40.610 --> 01:23:42.151
Did you need me to cry?

01:23:42.152 --> 01:23:44.484
Oh, there's the end-of-the-year
evaluations and...

01:23:44.485 --> 01:23:45.776
Gotcha, okay.

01:23:45.777 --> 01:23:48.443
Oh, booster seat!

01:23:48.444 --> 01:23:50.401
Why? I'm a man!

01:23:50.402 --> 01:23:51.818
That's good.
Throw in a juice box.

01:23:51.819 --> 01:23:54.234
- Say something about a juice...
- Oh, I wish I had a juice box!

01:23:54.235 --> 01:23:57.526
You're not getting a juice box! No.
Oh, please, just the one.

01:23:57.527 --> 01:23:58.527
Welcome to hell.
