<i>Oculus Deum.</i>

04:20.846 --> 04:23.110
She must be killed!

04:29.089 --> 04:31.319

<i>If she lives to bring about the End</i>
<i>of Days, there will be no redemption.</i>

04:35.061 --> 04:37.029

<i>I have the baby's head.</i>

05:38.329 --> 05:40.524
Don't push yet.

05:40.598 --> 05:44.227
One little push oughta finish this off.
One little push.

05:46.371 --> 05:49.033
You have a beautiful baby girl.

05:49.107 --> 05:50.905
Oh!

05:50.976 --> 05:54.707
She's so beautiful!

05:54.780 --> 05:57.715
She's so beautiful!

05:58.851 --> 06:00.944
Just gonna take her
and clean her up.

06:01.020 --> 06:02.920
- Not yet.
- Hospital rules.

06:02.988 --> 06:05.014
Please. You'll have her back
before you know it.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.241
Here she is.

07:59.347 --> 08:04.046
All fresh and clean.

08:04.118 --> 08:07.747
You thought of a name for her yet?
Christine.

08:07.822 --> 08:10.382
Her name is Christine.

08:10.458 --> 08:13.758
Happy birthday, Christine.

08:47.188 --> 08:50.248
<i>Hey, Bobby, come over here.</i>
<i>Something weird's goin' on.</i>

08:58.800 --> 09:00.961
What do you got there, Charlie?
I don't know.

09:01.036 --> 09:03.903
Pressure's climbin' off the gauge.

09:24.995 --> 09:27.122
Go the other way!

10:43.699 --> 10:45.792
Excuse me.

11:57.678 --> 12:00.203
What the hell are you--

12:12.460 --> 12:14.360
Mmm.

12:46.998 --> 12:49.262
<i>You're on</i> Gotham Talk.

<i>Is the world going to come to an end</i>

12:55.206 --> 12:57.800
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>
<i>You should play it safe,</i>

12:57.876 --> 12:59.811
<i>not quit your job just yet.</i>

12:59.879 --> 13:01.972
<i>Tell you something else:</i>

13:02.047 --> 13:04.311
<i>this place is gonna see</i>
<i>the wildest party ever.</i>

13:04.383 --> 13:07.648
<i>We're gonna be there with the first hundred
callers, we're gonna make the most noise,</i>

13:07.720 --> 13:10.712

<i>and if the world comes to an end,</i>

13:10.789 --> 13:12.757
<i>what the hell,</i>
<i>we're all gonna be together!</i>

13:12.825 --> 13:15.021
<i>And if it doesn't,</i>
<i>and I don't think it will,</i>

13:15.095 --> 13:17.586
<i>then we'll all have the best time</i>
<i>anybody has ever had.</i>

<i>Let's go. We're gonna be late.</i>

13:49.298 --> 13:51.789
<i>Honey, I'm home.</i>

13:55.170 --> 13:58.698
I was just pulling myself together.

13:58.775 --> 14:01.505
It's gonna take a lot more pulling.

14:03.780 --> 14:05.748
<i>You are looking</i>
<i>very sharp this morning.</i>

14:05.815 --> 14:08.340
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

14:08.418 --> 14:11.547
You got about five minutes
to get ready. Here.

14:11.622 --> 14:13.681
There's enough caffeine in this
to kill an elephant.

14:13.757 --> 14:17.158
Oughta get you started.

14:18.829 --> 14:21.354
- So what's today?
- Transport.

14:23.467 --> 14:25.698
Anyone special?

14:31.009 --> 14:33.341
No, just some Wall Street scumbag.

14:33.411 --> 14:36.778
Why the hell does he need
all this protection?

14:36.848 --> 14:38.874
Well, I guess he fucked
with some people...

14:38.951 --> 14:41.784
<i>that didn't like</i>
<i>being fucked with.</i>

14:41.854 --> 14:46.621
Personally, I like scumbags.
They pay better.

15:08.483 --> 15:11.782
They say breakfast
is the most important meal of the day.

15:16.290 --> 15:17.882
No, I'm good.
Thanks.

15:17.959 --> 15:20.086

<i>- Striker Four--</i>
<i>- Okay, you zeroes.</i>

15:28.170 --> 15:30.400
These people are paying us good money.

15:30.472 --> 15:33.771
Get your heads out of your asses

16:46.220 --> 16:48.917
<i>Sky Two,</i>
<i>fire escape, southwest corner.</i>

16:50.391 --> 16:52.757
Fire escape's negative.

17:08.396 --> 17:11.160
You're wrong! Shooter!
Evac! Evac!

17:11.232 --> 17:13.426
Get in the car!

17:38.628 --> 17:41.096

Get me an ambulance!

17:41.164 --> 17:44.362

<i>- I see him! I see him!</i>

Shit!

Oh, shit! Tell me
you remembered! Come on!

17:57.948 --> 17:59.974
Get up, you pussy.

18:02.454 --> 18:04.547
Where's the shooter?

18:04.623 --> 18:06.648
- Headed for the roof.
- So are we.

18:10.529 --> 18:13.624
Sky Two, get the fuck
down here, now!

18:14.800 --> 18:17.598
Come on! Hurry!

18:36.757 --> 18:39.055
Take us up there!

18:53.908 --> 18:56.070
Move in! Move in!

19:29.046 --> 19:32.538
- Set us down! Hurry!
- There's too much crap on that roof!

19:32.617 --> 19:35.586
<i>- We'll tear off the main rotor.</i>
<i>- Then get us down as low as you can!</i>

19:35.653 --> 19:38.554
<i>Hurry now! Go!</i>

19:38.623 --> 19:40.387
Strap me in!

19:43.729 --> 19:46.755
You're good!

20:20.034 --> 20:22.631
He's gonna jump off the roof! Shit!

20:30.679 --> 20:33.239
He's got him!

20:47.296 --> 20:49.161
Gun! Gun!

22:14.089 --> 22:18.686
Oculus Dei!
<i>The thousand years has ended!</i>

22:18.761 --> 22:21.229
The Dark Angel is loosed
from his prison!

22:21.297 --> 22:24.357
Get down on the ground and
put your hands behind your head.

22:25.968 --> 22:27.936
You don't know
what you've done!

22:28.004 --> 22:31.338
- Get down, or I'll put you down!
- The thousand years has ended!

22:31.408 --> 22:33.740
You don't know what you've done!

23:16.356 --> 23:18.881
Priest that drinks.
Can't be all bad.

23:18.959 --> 23:21.621
I think the police
may want that at some point.

23:21.695 --> 23:24.163
- They call it evidence.
- I like to get a head start.

23:24.231 --> 23:26.745
- No reason to make it easy for them.
- Yeah.

23:26.879 --> 23:28.973
All right.

23:31.685 --> 23:34.984
Watch the lines.
<i>Go through here.</i>

23:38.925 --> 23:41.291
She doesn't look happy
with the statements.

23:41.361 --> 23:44.957
Should've just killed that son
of a bitch. Less paperwork. Yeah.

23:45.032 --> 23:47.796
Hey, Detective. Bobby.
Hey, Jer, it's been a while.

23:47.868 --> 23:51.736
Hey. How are you, Marge?
Can't complain. You?

23:51.806 --> 23:54.172
It's a nice day to jump out
of a helicopter.

23:54.241 --> 23:56.472
Well, just doing my job.

23:56.545 --> 23:58.536
Now, listen.
Something I gotta ask you.

23:58.613 --> 24:01.605
<i>Yeah, what is it?</i>
You still drinking?

24:01.683 --> 24:03.878
<i>Oh, yeah, we got all</i>
<i>liquored up this morning.</i>

24:03.952 --> 24:06.819
- We start every day that way.
- I'm just reading his statement.

24:06.888 --> 24:10.450
You said here the guy spoke to you.
Yeah. So what?

24:10.526 --> 24:13.290
The guy doesn't have a tongue.

24:13.363 --> 24:16.491
- What?
- He has no tongue?

24:16.566 --> 24:20.263
Why don't I just leave
that little detail out for now.

24:20.336 --> 24:23.430
No big deal, right?
<i>Are you saying that I imagined all this?</i>

24:23.506 --> 24:26.067
No, I'm just saying.
I saved a life today.

24:26.143 --> 24:28.111
What the hell did you do?
All right, let it go.

24:28.178 --> 24:30.476
- No, no. I know what I heard.
- All right.

24:30.547 --> 24:33.345
<i>Those people who don't</i>
<i>belong here, get them out of here.</i>

24:33.417 --> 24:35.408
Make sure this place is secure.

24:52.337 --> 24:56.297
A drunk hangs out in a neighborhood bar,
passes out enough times,

24:56.375 --> 24:59.310
people would know where he lived
from carrying him home.

24:59.378 --> 25:01.312
I mean, it's one thing I know.

25:01.380 --> 25:03.746
Yeah, well, it's important to be
an expert at something.

25:03.816 --> 25:07.115
Oh, it took years of research.
This must be it.

25:17.364 --> 25:20.561
What do you want to bet
it's rent-controlled?

25:49.231 --> 25:51.393
Well, I don't think this is paint.

25:54.237 --> 25:56.603
A real art buff.

25:56.673 --> 26:00.006
I don't go for this look.
It's just too damn busy.

26:11.789 --> 26:14.451
Listen to this.

26:14.525 --> 26:16.925
"I have seen the Earth
laid to waste.

26:16.994 --> 26:22.262
<i>"I have seen the horror to come. Is it</i>
<i>a sin to wish you were never born?</i>

26:22.334 --> 26:25.132
<i>"The thousand years have ended.</i>

26:25.203 --> 26:28.570
Twenty... seven."

26:28.640 --> 26:31.768
<i>It ends in a football score.</i>
<i>That's nice.</i>

26:36.482 --> 26:38.382
<i>Hey, I found something.</i>

26:38.451 --> 26:42.080
Can you see what it is?

26:47.159 --> 26:49.822
His tongue.

26:51.131 --> 26:54.328
<i>He must have</i>
<i>cut it out himself.</i>

26:54.401 --> 26:59.634
Okay. And why is it someone would
cut out their own tongue?

26:59.706 --> 27:02.938
To keep from talking.
Right.

27:07.115 --> 27:09.583
Well, I could eat.

27:09.651 --> 27:11.983
Ah!

27:12.053 --> 27:14.749
- Shit!
- What?

27:16.191 --> 27:18.625
All right, I knew
that was gonna happen.

27:18.694 --> 27:21.185
No, it's all right.

27:21.263 --> 27:23.254
There's something in here.

27:30.105 --> 27:32.301
Have you ever seen her before?
Nah.

28:03.942 --> 28:06.672
<i>This guy</i>
<i>is no ordinary hit man.</i>

28:06.745 --> 28:08.804
No, this one's extraordinary.

28:08.880 --> 28:11.747
Let's get the hell outta here.
This place is making me itch.

28:11.817 --> 28:15.982
- Drop it! Don't move! Freeze!
- Don't move! Freeze!

28:17.457 --> 28:19.584
Oh. It's us.

28:20.960 --> 28:24.020
<i>Jesus! How the hell</i>
<i>did you two find this place?</i>

28:24.097 --> 28:27.191
Lucky guess.
So what did you find out?

28:27.267 --> 28:29.861
His name's Thomas Aquinas.
He's a priest.

28:29.937 --> 28:31.996
Why don't you tell us
something we don't know?

28:32.072 --> 28:35.564
- A homicidal priest. That's good.
- Yeah? Well, it gets better.

28:35.643 --> 28:38.840
He studied at the Vatican.
He was one of their alleged visionaries.

28:38.912 --> 28:41.746
Came here in '81
to St. John's Church downtown.

28:41.816 --> 28:44.580
<i>Six months ago, he disappeared.</i>

28:44.653 --> 28:47.121
Priests there say he was
having a spiritual crisis.

28:47.188 --> 28:49.588
Oh, yeah.
That's what this is about.

28:49.658 --> 28:52.855
Spiritual crisis.
Doesn't make any sense.

28:52.927 --> 28:55.691
<i>What's a priest doing shooting</i>
<i>at a Wall Street banker?</i>

28:55.764 --> 28:59.724
<i>A Wall Street banker,</i>
<i>by the way, who suddenly disappeared.</i>

28:59.802 --> 29:01.702
Maybe we should ask the girl.

29:01.771 --> 29:04.069
What girl?

29:04.140 --> 29:07.598
Uh, the guy. The guy. Priest guy.

29:11.014 --> 29:13.209
There's five million women
living in New York City.

29:13.283 --> 29:15.195
How we gonna find her
without a name?

30:00.777 --> 30:02.711
Here.

30:08.286 --> 30:11.255
Look, I already gave you some money.
Can you just move on, please?

30:11.322 --> 30:14.951
He's comin' for you.
He's comin' for you, Christine.

30:15.026 --> 30:17.119
How do you know my name?

30:17.195 --> 30:20.995
He's gonna fuck you. He's gonna
fuck you, Christine. Can you see him?

30:21.065 --> 30:23.298
- Can you see him?
- Who are you?

30:23.368 --> 30:25.598
<i>How do you know my name?</i>

30:31.176 --> 30:34.009
He's gonna fuck you, Christine.

30:47.994 --> 30:51.761
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

31:35.679 --> 31:37.613
Ohh.

31:53.498 --> 31:56.194
The thousand years have ended.

31:56.267 --> 31:59.430
Thousand years have ended.

32:59.969 --> 33:02.699
"When the thousand years are ended,

33:02.772 --> 33:06.037
Satan shall be loosed
out of his prison."

33:07.543 --> 33:10.579
<i>"Twenty... seven. "</i>

33:22.626 --> 33:24.560
<i>Christine?</i>

33:26.863 --> 33:29.389
<i>Christine?</i>
I'll be there in a sec!

33:44.950 --> 33:46.884
Doctor's office.

33:46.952 --> 33:48.920
Hello.
Is Dr. Abel in, please?

33:48.987 --> 33:50.921
Who's calling, please?
It's Christine York.

33:50.989 --> 33:54.425
<i>Christine, listen to me.</i>
<i>We've been over this before.</i>

33:54.493 --> 33:59.158
It's a terrible thing to lose your
parents. I know it was a long time ago.

33:59.232 --> 34:02.793
The holidays always make something
like that feel much worse.

34:02.869 --> 34:08.239
Understand, these dreams are your
creation. There's nothing real about them.

34:09.742 --> 34:13.304
You control them.
They don't control you.

34:15.081 --> 34:17.550
Take another Xanax
to relieve your anxiety.

34:18.719 --> 34:21.654
You are fine. Trust me.

34:24.091 --> 34:27.619
Another vision?
Why didn't you tell me?

34:27.696 --> 34:31.860
I didn't want you to worry. <i>I'm your</i>
<i>stepmother. It's my job to worry.</i>

34:31.933 --> 34:33.867
No big deal, really.

34:33.935 --> 34:37.735
<i>Just someone on the subway car</i>
<i>turned into porcelain and shattered.</i>

34:37.806 --> 34:41.333
<i>What's wrong with me? Why do I see</i>
<i>things? Why am I so different?</i>

34:41.409 --> 34:45.676
Oh, you don't know how special you are.

34:45.748 --> 34:49.047
You're better than everybody else.
Just remember that.

34:49.118 --> 34:52.053
I don't want to be better or worse.
I want to be normal.

34:52.121 --> 34:55.853
I want a normal life.
You have to have patience.

34:55.926 --> 34:58.360
All good things will come
to you. You'll see.

35:06.515 --> 35:09.974
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry, we're closed.

35:10.053 --> 35:13.318
I would like to talk to you
about Thomas Aquinas.

35:13.389 --> 35:15.550
Father, please, I need you downstairs.
Just take these.

35:15.625 --> 35:17.559
Father, please.
Go.

35:20.697 --> 35:24.293
I've already told the police. Thomas
was a friend of mine and a colleague.

35:24.368 --> 35:27.303
He had nothing to do
with what happened today.

35:27.371 --> 35:29.339
There was no one else
on that fire escape.

35:29.406 --> 35:33.365
You don't understand. I understand
getting shot at, and I don't like it.

35:33.444 --> 35:36.312
He shot at you?
No, he shot at my client.

35:36.381 --> 35:39.578
- I happened to get in the way.
- Who's your client?

35:39.651 --> 35:40.905
That's irrelevant right now.

35:40.931 --> 35:43.840
What I want to know is why would
a priest try to kill someone?

35:43.888 --> 35:48.222
You've been drinking. I've got 14
years sober, and I can spot that.

35:48.293 --> 35:52.253
Well, good for you. Your friend and
colleague, was he working for someone?

35:52.331 --> 35:54.356
Yes, he was working for God.

35:54.433 --> 35:57.163
So God ordered a hit
on an investment banker?

35:57.236 --> 36:00.103
There's a lot that you don't know.
You think you've seen everything?

36:00.172 --> 36:02.367
You haven't. There are
things you never dreamed of.

36:02.441 --> 36:06.401
There's another world out there.
Thomas saw it, and it destroyed him.

36:06.480 --> 36:10.610
I've seen a lot too, but there's nothing
that would make me cut my tongue out.

36:10.684 --> 36:14.415
Yeah, well, wait a few days.
What happens in a few days?

36:14.488 --> 36:16.922
<i>Did Thomas tell you</i>
<i>about a girl?</i>

36:19.294 --> 36:22.320
- No.
- I see. Do you believe in God?

36:25.166 --> 36:28.397
Maybe once, but not anymore.

36:28.469 --> 36:30.596
What happened?

36:30.672 --> 36:33.164
We had a difference of opinion.

36:33.242 --> 36:37.702
I thought that my wife and daughter
should live, and He felt otherwise.

36:37.780 --> 36:42.183
I'm sorry to hear about the loss. Maybe
it's time for you to renew your faith.

36:43.886 --> 36:46.081
This girl.

36:46.155 --> 36:48.454
Is she in trouble?
Does she need help?

36:48.525 --> 36:51.494
I have a lot of things to do here.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

36:51.561 --> 36:54.462
I have more questions, if you don't mind.
I've got a question for you.

36:54.531 --> 36:57.398
If you don't believe in God,
how can you understand his adversary?

36:57.467 --> 37:01.871
Now I have to believe in God
in order to solve a crime?

37:01.939 --> 37:05.102
I'm sure that you can
find your way out.

37:42.949 --> 37:45.680
- How many have received the stigmata?
- She's the third this week.

37:50.758 --> 37:55.058
<i>What is she saying?</i> For your own good,
get out and forget what you've seen!

37:55.129 --> 37:59.396
Was Thomas part of this? There are forces
at work you couldn't possibly comprehend!

37:59.467 --> 38:02.163
<i>Now, please, leave!</i>

39:05.704 --> 39:10.038
No, it's just I hate the fact that
they put finals <i>after</i> the holiday.

39:10.108 --> 39:12.134
It ruins the whole meaning
of vacation.

39:12.212 --> 39:14.908
I wouldn't worry.
You always do fine.

39:14.981 --> 39:17.078
Besides, a bad grade
isn't the end of the world.

39:31.065 --> 39:34.125
It's you.

39:34.201 --> 39:36.431
I didn't--
Where is she?

39:36.504 --> 39:39.599
The girl is safe.
And what of the world?

39:39.674 --> 39:42.404
Everything is as planned.

39:42.477 --> 39:44.968
Our acts go unnoticed, unquestioned.

39:45.046 --> 39:47.514
- We're everywhere.
- <i>Daddy, who is it?</i>

39:55.925 --> 39:59.520
- Is this your daughter?
- <i>Yes.</i>

40:02.698 --> 40:06.498
- <i>And this is your wife?</i>

What's wrong, baby? What's wrong?
It was a dream.

41:20.983 --> 41:24.009
He came for me again.
It's only a dream, angel.

41:24.086 --> 41:27.180
It felt closer.

41:32.060 --> 41:34.154
<i>Throughout the</i>
<i>country, the National Guard...</i>

41:34.230 --> 41:36.255
<i>has been put on alert</i>
<i>as a precaution--</i>

41:36.332 --> 41:38.892
<i>Mayor Giuliani urged</i>
<i>all citizens and police...</i>

41:38.968 --> 41:40.959
<i>to stay calm</i>
<i>during this holiday season.</i>

41:41.037 --> 41:44.029
<i>No explanations for how
blood on the hands of the Christ child,</i>

41:44.107 --> 41:46.598
<i>depicted in Michelangelo's</i>
<i>famous sculpture of the</i> Pieta--

41:46.676 --> 41:49.111
<i>...atmosphere of fear</i>
<i>and panic, random acts of violence...</i>

41:49.179 --> 41:51.943
<i>are being attributed to satanic cults</i>
<i>who seem determined...</i>

41:52.016 --> 41:53.950
<i>to disrupt New Year's celebrations</i>
<i>throughout the world.</i>

41:54.018 --> 41:55.391
<i>Here in New York--</i>

42:11.675 --> 42:14.872
Sorry, pal, you can't come in here.

42:14.945 --> 42:19.781
Ahh. The young boys that you seduced
have left their scent upon you.

42:22.387 --> 42:25.584
Remember who it is that you serve.
Hmm?

42:44.544 --> 42:46.876
<i>Open your eyes, Thomas.</i>

42:57.090 --> 43:01.926
Look. Look at the face that has haunted
your dreams for a thousand years.

43:19.515 --> 43:21.847
They say you can see the future, Thomas.

43:23.986 --> 43:28.447
Then you must know exactly
what I'm going to do to you.

43:30.360 --> 43:32.954
<i>I don't know what we hope</i>
<i>to get from this guy.</i>

43:33.029 --> 43:34.997
He's got no fuckin' tongue.
He can write.

44:04.629 --> 44:06.392
Fuck me.

44:08.100 --> 44:10.399
<i>There is still no explanation...</i>

44:10.470 --> 44:14.406
<i>for the devastating explosions</i>
<i>that rocked midtown two nights ago.</i>

44:14.474 --> 44:16.601
In the wake
of Tuesday night's explosion,

44:16.676 --> 44:21.477
investigators from the New York City Fire
Department are still at a loss to explain...

44:21.547 --> 44:26.076
<i>why the restaurant suddenly burst</i>
<i>into flames, killing at least 35 people.</i>

44:26.153 --> 44:29.884
- Hey, asshole, watch where you're going.
- Hey, I like the shirt.

44:29.957 --> 44:31.424
Screw you, man!

44:36.430 --> 44:38.489
Hey, kid.

44:41.436 --> 44:44.928
Nice shirt.

45:36.328 --> 45:39.263
<i>I'm tellin' you, no one entered the room.</i>
<i>Maybe he did it himself.</i>

45:39.331 --> 45:41.299
Then how did he get the last scalpel in!

45:41.366 --> 45:43.231
Oh, my God.

45:43.302 --> 45:47.398
- It just keeps getting better.
- I've never seen anything like this.

45:50.877 --> 45:54.677
<i>I think this</i>
<i>is written in Latin.</i>

45:54.747 --> 45:58.649
"When the thousand years has ended,

45:58.718 --> 46:04.350
Satan shall be loosed out of his prison."

46:04.424 --> 46:08.486
Uh, this next part is not clear. I-I-I
think it's in English.

46:08.562 --> 46:10.792
<i>It says, "Christ--</i>

46:10.864 --> 46:14.265
Christ in New York."

46:20.108 --> 46:22.542
Christ!

46:26.715 --> 46:31.448
Well, it's official. I'm never
sleeping again, ever. You okay?

46:33.189 --> 46:37.819
A guy cuts words into his chest.
Someone else nails him to the ceiling.

46:37.893 --> 46:40.361
What's not okay?

46:40.429 --> 46:42.590
So where we going?

46:42.665 --> 46:46.123
The girl. I gotta talk to her,
find out what she knows.

46:46.202 --> 46:48.171
W-W-Wait. We don't have a name.
That would help.

46:48.238 --> 46:52.766
Maybe we do.
Maybe it's not "Christ in New York."

46:52.843 --> 46:56.574
Maybe it's, "Chris in New York,"
"Christine in New York."

46:56.647 --> 47:02.143
"Christine York." Let's run a D.M.V. check
and find out if any of those names come up.

47:07.458 --> 47:09.426
<i>Hello, Christine York.</i>

47:09.494 --> 47:11.428
Sometimes you border on competent.

47:11.496 --> 47:15.160
- I know. It's scary, isn't it?

47:22.235 --> 47:24.795
<i>Christine?</i>

47:24.871 --> 47:27.635
Mabel called. She'd like you
to get dressed and join her for lunch.

47:27.707 --> 47:29.641
<i>Grazie,</i> Carson.

48:04.747 --> 48:07.511
No!

48:22.366 --> 48:24.425
Shit!

49:03.844 --> 49:05.641
No! No!

49:07.914 --> 49:10.007
Ahhh! Goddamn it, get off me!

49:10.083 --> 49:12.143
Go downstairs and watch the front door!
<i>Please!</i>

49:12.220 --> 49:15.087
Help!
There is no sanctuary but heaven.

49:15.156 --> 49:17.454
You must go there now.

49:17.525 --> 49:20.517
What are you doing? I commend you
to Almighty God and entrust you--

49:20.595 --> 49:22.859
<i>At what point is this considered...</i>

49:22.930 --> 49:25.695
interfering with
a police investigation?

49:25.767 --> 49:29.794
Hey, we are private citizens having
a conversation with another citizen.

49:29.872 --> 49:33.831
I mean, I don't think they've found
a way to outlaw that. At least not yet.

49:35.043 --> 49:37.671
<i>Please! No!</i>

49:40.250 --> 49:43.481
May you return to Him who formed--

49:51.761 --> 49:55.391
Go down there. Do whatever you can.
I need more time to finish the last rites.

49:55.466 --> 49:57.366
May Christ, the true shepherd--

49:57.434 --> 49:59.402
<i>Help!</i>
Stairs.

49:59.470 --> 50:01.404
Covered.

50:04.308 --> 50:05.707
<i>Help!</i>

50:11.116 --> 50:12.811
May you see your redeemer--

50:18.924 --> 50:21.415
...forever, amen.

51:01.803 --> 51:03.794
Son of a bitch!

51:26.730 --> 51:28.925
You all right?

51:28.999 --> 51:31.661
Yeah.
Check the body down the stairs.

51:31.735 --> 51:33.431
What body?

51:35.706 --> 51:38.766
Call the police, and get an ambulance.

51:42.046 --> 51:44.640
Take it easy. We're the good guys.

51:44.715 --> 51:47.206
<i>All right?</i>
<i>What happened?</i>

51:48.787 --> 51:52.951
Carson.
Those men-- Th-Those men--

51:53.025 --> 51:55.323
They tried to kill me.

51:55.394 --> 51:57.828
Why?

51:57.896 --> 52:01.731
<i>Eight jets, variable speed.</i>
<i>That's what I call dying in style.</i>

52:01.801 --> 52:03.928
What kind of girl lives in a house
like this, anyway?

52:04.003 --> 52:06.028
Oh, she's an orphan.
Both parents deceased.

52:06.105 --> 52:09.097
After the mother died, the home nurse
married the father.

52:09.175 --> 52:11.234
Now the nurse is the sole guardian.

52:11.310 --> 52:14.006
I think it's adorable the way you talk
like a real cop.

52:14.080 --> 52:16.777
Yeah? So you think after they clean up
this mess, we could...

52:16.850 --> 52:19.114
Don't tempt me.
<i>soak a little?</i>

52:48.317 --> 52:51.980
They relax me. You want one?
Oh, no, thanks. I drink.

52:53.222 --> 52:56.521
My little girl had one just like it.
Really?

52:56.592 --> 53:00.723
Mm-hmm. Yeah? You snoop through
her stuff without asking too?

53:00.797 --> 53:03.027
When I was looking for something.

53:03.100 --> 53:05.625
What are you looking for?

53:05.702 --> 53:07.636
A connection.

53:07.704 --> 53:10.832
Most days, I don't feel
connected to anyone.

53:10.907 --> 53:14.207
I noticed
a lot of religious books outside.

53:14.278 --> 53:16.405
Mm.
They're my stepmother's.

53:16.481 --> 53:19.279
- Is she a big believer?
- No, not really.

53:19.350 --> 53:21.875
It's mostly just kind of
like a hobby with her.

53:21.953 --> 53:25.218
Do you know a priest by the name
of Thomas Aquinas?

53:25.289 --> 53:28.123
No.
Is that your connection, religion?

53:28.193 --> 53:30.184
I've seen a lot of attempted murders,

53:30.262 --> 53:32.890
but I've never seen anyone
perform the last rites before.

53:32.965 --> 53:34.899
<i>Christine?</i>
In here!

53:36.401 --> 53:39.928
Are you all right? Oh, my God,
I just heard what happened!

53:40.005 --> 53:41.940
Did they hurt you?

53:42.008 --> 53:44.101
I'm okay, but Carson--

53:44.177 --> 53:46.839
I know. Oh.

53:48.281 --> 53:51.114
I'm just so glad you came along
when you did.

53:51.184 --> 53:53.225
Thanks.

54:18.553 --> 54:22.489
I didn't realize you knew where
the library was, let alone had a card.

54:23.925 --> 54:26.224
Well, there's a lot
about me you don't know.

54:30.232 --> 54:32.097
<i>They're right outside.</i>

54:32.167 --> 54:34.761
<i>You must</i>
<i>bring her. He is waiting for her.</i>

54:34.837 --> 54:37.931
No, that's impossible!
They'll follow me and find the temple!

54:40.910 --> 54:42.844
I couldn't convince her
to come here.

54:48.318 --> 54:52.414
Yuck!
Then I shall have to go to her.

54:52.488 --> 54:54.582
<i>Did I mention</i>
<i>I had a date tonight?</i>

54:54.658 --> 54:56.853
Not just the inflatable kind.
A real live girl.

54:56.927 --> 54:59.122
Did you break up
with the inflatable one?

54:59.196 --> 55:03.189
Yeah. She was just too needy.

55:03.267 --> 55:05.861
Everything was about her.

55:05.936 --> 55:08.633
It's just that this is starting
to feel a lot like work.

55:08.707 --> 55:12.473
<i>Normally, I wouldn't mind work</i>
<i>because, well, you know,</i>

55:12.544 --> 55:14.603
<i>we'd be getting paid.</i>

55:14.679 --> 55:17.705
Watching rich people for free.
It just seems odd, doesn't it?

55:21.152 --> 55:23.485
Okay, I'll wait here.

55:31.764 --> 55:34.562
- Change your mind about the pill?
- I found something.

55:37.237 --> 55:40.468
Christine, what are you doing?
Why is that man here?

55:40.540 --> 55:42.474
I'll be five minutes.

55:42.542 --> 55:46.000
<i>She loves me to death, but she's</i>
<i>a little overprotective.</i>

56:10.172 --> 56:12.663
I took this from one
of your attackers.

56:12.741 --> 56:15.266
Did you show that to the police?
No.

56:15.344 --> 56:19.338
If I did, it would end up in a plastic
envelope on one of their large shelves.

56:19.416 --> 56:23.352
That's pretty cynical. Well,
I've put a few of those envelopes...

56:23.420 --> 56:25.888
up on that large shelf myself.

56:25.956 --> 56:28.720
I used to be a cop.

56:28.792 --> 56:31.124
Now, this amulet
is from a Masonic order...

56:31.194 --> 56:34.426
in a former sub-herald
of the Vatican knights.

56:34.498 --> 56:36.625
<i>The Knights</i>
<i>of the Holy See.</i>

56:36.701 --> 56:39.864
<i>They await the return</i>
<i>of the Dark Angel to Earth.</i>

56:39.937 --> 56:43.464
So, the men that attacked me
are devil worshippers?

56:43.541 --> 56:46.772
No. This says
they're the good guys.

56:46.844 --> 56:49.939
They're the ones that are supposed
to stop the devil worshippers.

56:50.015 --> 56:53.281
Those were the good guys?
What does that have to do with me?

57:03.429 --> 57:07.388
I'm sorry.
I have a medical condition.

57:07.467 --> 57:11.961
Sometimes I see things that aren't
there. No. I saw it too.

57:40.101 --> 57:42.092
I've been having visions
ever since I can remember,

57:42.170 --> 57:44.662
but I've never shared one before.

57:44.740 --> 57:46.674
There must be an explanation.

57:46.742 --> 57:49.142
I hope so. I've been waiting
all my life to hear it.

58:49.742 --> 58:52.210
Let's get out of here!
Come on!

58:52.278 --> 58:53.905
You're not going anywhere.

58:53.980 --> 58:56.279
- What are you doing?
- There's no time to discuss this.

58:59.220 --> 59:01.950
<i>After all these years of waiting, it's</i>
<i>finally happening.</i> What's happening?

59:02.022 --> 59:03.887
<i>You can't run away now!</i>

59:06.393 --> 59:09.123
<i>Stop it!</i>
Let her go! No!

59:19.441 --> 59:21.966
Don't you love me?

59:22.043 --> 59:24.034
Didn't I give you everything?

59:24.112 --> 59:27.776
Haven't I been a mother to you?

59:47.604 --> 59:49.595
No-o-o!

01:00:04.002 --> 01:00:07.632
- Christine. You know who I am.
- Oh, no.

01:00:07.707 --> 01:00:10.471
- I've come for you.
- Let's go. Come on.

01:00:27.494 --> 01:00:31.624
You only had one simple job,
and you couldn't even do that.

01:00:46.881 --> 01:00:50.818
Hey, Marge? Marge, over here!
We need your help!

01:00:50.886 --> 01:00:52.854
Easy with the hardware.

01:00:55.624 --> 01:00:58.787
Jesus, Marge!
What the fuck?

01:00:58.861 --> 01:01:01.352
<i>It's okay, Jer.</i>
<i>We just want the girl.</i>

01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:04.889
Okay, tell me. What the hell
is going on here? I don't know.

01:01:04.968 --> 01:01:07.300
I don't believe you.

01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:10.237
- All right. I'm coming out.
- Throw out the gun.

01:01:10.307 --> 01:01:14.038
Please don't don't
leave me here. Please!

01:01:19.984 --> 01:01:21.383
<i>Hands on your head.</i>

01:01:21.452 --> 01:01:24.751
What?
<i>Hands on your head. Now!</i>

01:01:33.465 --> 01:01:35.558
What do you want with her, Marge?
Huh?

01:01:35.634 --> 01:01:40.162
<i>- Why is she so important?</i>
- Just the girl. You can kill him.

01:01:54.454 --> 01:01:56.649
Come on!
Quickly!

01:02:14.575 --> 01:02:17.511
<i>You, I don't need.</i>

01:02:17.579 --> 01:02:20.548
But you--

01:02:20.615 --> 01:02:23.448
Call your people.
Find them.

01:02:38.935 --> 01:02:41.665
Over here.

01:02:45.976 --> 01:02:48.877
Goddamn it!

01:02:48.946 --> 01:02:52.507
Get up!
Come on. Get up!

01:02:52.583 --> 01:02:56.576
My best friend is dead. Everyone is
trying to kill us. I just shot two cops.

01:02:56.653 --> 01:02:59.384
Why is everyone after you?
I don't know.

01:02:59.457 --> 01:03:01.550
I swear. I don't know.
Why is this happening?

01:03:01.626 --> 01:03:04.993
<i>I know it's my fault.</i>
<i>I just don't know why.</i>

01:03:06.965 --> 01:03:10.264
<i>That man on the stairs,</i>
<i>what do you know about him?</i>

01:03:10.335 --> 01:03:12.826
Nothing.
Come on. I saw your face.

01:03:12.904 --> 01:03:15.430
You recognized him.
I don't talk about it.

01:03:15.507 --> 01:03:18.271
Tell me.
I need to know.

01:03:22.648 --> 01:03:27.108
I've seen him before...
in my dreams.

01:03:27.186 --> 01:03:31.783
- In your dreams?
- They're-- They're nightmares really.

01:03:31.858 --> 01:03:35.794
He takes me, and--
and he makes love to me.

01:03:35.862 --> 01:03:38.456
I've been making love
to him my whole life.

01:03:38.531 --> 01:03:42.400
I thought I was crazy, but he was
never real before tonight.

01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:45.030
Oh, he's real.
I've seen him before.

01:03:45.106 --> 01:03:49.736
I'm afraid. Don't be afraid.
I won't let him do any harm to you.

01:03:49.810 --> 01:03:54.747
I'm afraid of me. I'm afraid that
if I see him, if he tries to take me,

01:03:54.815 --> 01:03:57.580
I'm gonna want him to.

01:03:57.653 --> 01:04:01.145
Let's go!

01:04:01.223 --> 01:04:03.847
Where we going?
To get some answers.

01:04:14.392 --> 01:04:17.225
You don't need that.
You have no enemies here.

01:04:17.295 --> 01:04:20.924
I'm not so sure about that. This
girl was just attacked by your people.

01:04:20.999 --> 01:04:24.902
Your Vatican knights almost killed her!
Vatican knights?

01:04:24.970 --> 01:04:26.904
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:04:26.972 --> 01:04:30.032
Well, they're not my people.
They think they're doing God's work.

01:04:30.109 --> 01:04:32.270
- But they're not.
- I want to know what's going on,

01:04:32.344 --> 01:04:34.744
and I want to know right now!
Put the gun away.

01:04:34.814 --> 01:04:37.578
Did anybody see you come?

01:04:37.650 --> 01:04:41.348
No.
Good. We should be safe here.

01:04:41.421 --> 01:04:46.916
According to the Scriptures, he can't
see inside of the house of God.

01:04:46.993 --> 01:04:49.723
Who can't?
Maybe now you're ready to believe.

01:05:08.183 --> 01:05:11.084
Her hands are healed.
That's the power of faith.

01:05:11.153 --> 01:05:13.451
- Who is she?
- She's a Polish peasant.

01:05:13.522 --> 01:05:15.615
<i>She fell into a trance</i>
<i>about two weeks ago,</i>

01:05:15.691 --> 01:05:18.751
and then she began to speak in a language
she couldn't possibly have known.

01:05:18.827 --> 01:05:23.492
<i>She made a prophecy about End of Days.</i>
"End of Days"?

01:05:23.566 --> 01:05:26.592
Of man's destruction and
the unholy's reign upon the earth.

01:05:26.669 --> 01:05:30.002
Why don't you stop all this church talk
and tell us what the hell is going on.

01:05:30.073 --> 01:05:35.010
Who's after her? Well, if you'll
excuse me, I'll try to explain.

01:05:35.078 --> 01:05:37.775
<i>You know anything about</i>
<i>the number of the beast?</i>

01:05:37.848 --> 01:05:40.646
Revelation of St. John?
From his dream?

01:05:40.718 --> 01:05:44.711
Six-six-six? The number of the beast
is not six-six-six.

01:05:44.788 --> 01:05:49.088
Often in dreams, numbers appear
upside down and backwards.

01:05:49.159 --> 01:05:53.426
So, six-six-six becomes nine-nine-nine.

01:05:53.498 --> 01:05:56.399
Like in 1999, the year of his return.

01:05:56.468 --> 01:05:58.698
What does that have to do with me?

01:06:00.005 --> 01:06:03.372
Regressus diaboli:
<i>The return of Satan.</i>

01:06:03.441 --> 01:06:06.570
Does any of this
look familiar to you?

01:06:17.223 --> 01:06:22.025
She's been chosen.
He's in her blood.

01:06:22.095 --> 01:06:26.225
<i>The Holy Church has been searching</i>
<i>for you since the day you were born.</i>

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:29.326
Chosen for what? <i>Every thousand years,</i>
<i>on the eve of the millennium,</i>

01:06:29.403 --> 01:06:31.530
the Dark Angel comes and takes a body,

01:06:31.605 --> 01:06:36.009
and then he walks the Earth, looking for
a woman who will bear his child.

01:06:36.077 --> 01:06:39.945
<i>It all has to happen in that unholy hour</i>
<i>before midnight on New Year's Eve.</i>

01:06:40.014 --> 01:06:43.711
<i>If he consummates</i>
<i>your flesh with this human body,</i>

01:06:43.785 --> 01:06:46.583
then he unlocks the gate of hell...

01:06:46.654 --> 01:06:50.591
<i>and everything as we know it</i>
<i>ceases to exist.</i>

01:06:50.659 --> 01:06:53.685
<i>So, the Prince of Darkness</i>
<i>wants to conquer the Earth,</i>

01:06:53.762 --> 01:06:56.890
<i>but has to wait until an hour</i>
<i>before midnight of New Year's Eve?</i>

01:06:56.966 --> 01:07:00.402
Is this Eastern time? It's got
nothing to do with New Year's Eve.

01:07:00.469 --> 01:07:03.462
It has to do with a temporary
celestial alignment.

01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:06.407
<i>The Gregorian monks</i>
<i>studied the heavens.</i>

01:07:06.476 --> 01:07:09.240
They were able to calculate
the precise moment of this event.

01:07:09.312 --> 01:07:12.076
<i>They created our calendar</i>
<i>by mapping this event...</i>

01:07:12.148 --> 01:07:14.776
<i>and counting backwards</i>
<i>from that moment.</i>

01:07:14.851 --> 01:07:18.652
It was a mistake to come here. It doesn't
matter whether you believe or not.

01:07:18.723 --> 01:07:21.851
He's real, and he won't rest
till he finds this girl.

01:07:21.926 --> 01:07:25.692
Why did he pick me? Because the stars
were right when you were born.

01:07:25.763 --> 01:07:29.164
<i>A man's body was also chosen,</i>
<i>just like yours.</i>

01:07:29.233 --> 01:07:32.670
<i>If the devil does exist,</i>
<i>why doesn't your god do anything?</i>

01:07:32.738 --> 01:07:38.040
It's not <i>my</i> God. It's <i>our</i> God, and
He doesn't say that He will save us.

01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:41.273
He says that we will save ourselves.

01:07:41.346 --> 01:07:44.612
<i>Save myself? What am I supposed</i>
<i>to do? Get a restraining order?</i>

01:07:44.684 --> 01:07:47.983
- We have to have faith.
- Faith.

01:07:48.054 --> 01:07:50.545
<i>Yes, faith.</i>
<i>It's an interesting concept.</i>

01:07:50.623 --> 01:07:53.820
If you read the Bible,
you can't miss it. Faith!

01:07:53.893 --> 01:07:58.478
Between your faith and my Glock
nine millimeter, I take my Glock.

01:07:58.504 --> 01:07:59.824
Come on. Let's go.

01:07:59.867 --> 01:08:03.564
I'm afraid it takes a person of
pure heart to defeat pure evil.

01:08:03.637 --> 01:08:06.470
You did your job. You brought her here
to people of faith. We'll protect her.

01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:10.772
- We'll hide her.
- You know, you live in a different world.

01:08:10.844 --> 01:08:14.474
We have some real serious problems here,
and this is not solving them.

01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:17.746
Satan's greatest trick was convincing man
he didn't exist.

01:08:21.555 --> 01:08:26.584
I don't, uh--
This all feels true to me.

01:08:26.661 --> 01:08:32.100
You'll be safer with me. At least I can
fight this guy with something real.

01:08:32.167 --> 01:08:34.658
<i>You know what to do.</i>
<i>You feel it.</i>

01:08:44.747 --> 01:08:47.080
I'm sorry.

01:08:49.219 --> 01:08:51.153
Let him go.

01:09:19.558 --> 01:09:22.152
It gets easier when you
accept what you are.

01:09:22.227 --> 01:09:26.323
A fallen soul.
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

01:09:29.703 --> 01:09:32.001
<i>Door's locked,</i>
<i>no windows broken.</i>

01:09:32.072 --> 01:09:35.529
- How did I get in here?
- Who the fuck are you?

01:09:35.608 --> 01:09:38.042
Oh, I think you know who I am.

01:09:38.111 --> 01:09:40.636
You just don't want to believe it.

01:09:42.249 --> 01:09:44.716
I took a bullet for you.

01:09:44.785 --> 01:09:47.117
I protected you.
Oh, no-no-no. You didn't protect me.

01:09:47.188 --> 01:09:51.488
You protected this body. Am I--
Am I getting a pattern here?

01:09:51.559 --> 01:09:57.021
So much pain.
"Not to be taken with alcohol."

01:09:57.099 --> 01:09:59.761
Remember that.

01:09:59.835 --> 01:10:01.803
Oh.

01:10:01.870 --> 01:10:04.532
<i>To lose a wife and child.</i>

01:10:06.007 --> 01:10:09.307
I can't even imagine
what that must be like.

01:10:09.378 --> 01:10:14.111
- What do you want?
- To make you happy again.

01:10:14.183 --> 01:10:19.246

Amy?

01:10:47.244 --> 01:10:49.909
<i>Don't stay in there too long.
You'll turn into a prune.</i>

01:10:49.954 --> 01:10:52.583
- Emily!
- Come on, darling. It's time to get out.

01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:56.587
<i>Gotta get you dressed.</i>
<i>Your daddy's gonna be home soon.</i>

01:10:56.662 --> 01:10:58.892
I have the best daddy
in the whole world.

01:10:58.964 --> 01:11:00.898
Yes, you certainly do.

01:11:00.966 --> 01:11:03.594
But I don't think he'll be home.

01:11:03.669 --> 01:11:06.537
<i>Now, what makes you say</i>
<i>a silly thing like that?</i>

01:11:06.606 --> 01:11:09.404
He never comes home. <i>Well, honey,
you know your daddy works hard.</i>

01:11:09.476 --> 01:11:12.741
It's not about how much time you're
there. It's about "quality time."

01:11:12.813 --> 01:11:16.510
Now, he'll be home just like he promised.
You'll see.

01:11:16.583 --> 01:11:18.517
<i>He keeps his promises.</i>

01:11:18.585 --> 01:11:22.522
I can give it all back to you.
<i>Everything</i> that He took away.

01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:24.285
Everything.

01:11:24.358 --> 01:11:27.293
<i>You can hold your wife again.</i>

01:11:27.361 --> 01:11:31.092
You can watch your daughter walk through
the door in her prom dress.

01:11:31.165 --> 01:11:34.135
All you have to do is tell me
where the girl is.

01:11:34.203 --> 01:11:37.934
Come on. She's a nobody to you.
You don't even know her.

01:11:38.006 --> 01:11:40.497
You're in the middle of something
you don't really understand.

01:11:40.576 --> 01:11:43.807
You think you're saving her from me?
She wants to be with me.

01:11:43.879 --> 01:11:46.780
- <i>You know that.</i>
- What did you do in school today?

01:11:46.849 --> 01:11:50.547
<i>- You think I'd harm her?</i>
<i>-  I'd treat her like a queen.</i>

01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:54.215
Turn around, sweetheart. <i>You told me
you'd do anything to get your family back.</i>

01:11:54.290 --> 01:11:57.748
You want them?
This is your chance.

01:11:57.827 --> 01:12:01.092
They're not real.
<i>Does that matter?</i>

01:12:01.164 --> 01:12:03.861
- Oh, yes.
- <i>I think you need to be reminded...</i>

01:12:03.934 --> 01:12:06.494
of how painful reality is.

01:12:08.138 --> 01:12:10.504
<i>No!</i>

01:12:19.885 --> 01:12:21.648
Oh, shit!

01:12:30.262 --> 01:12:32.231
Don't hurt my baby!

01:12:32.298 --> 01:12:34.698
- <i>Daddy!</i>
- Let my daughter go!

01:12:37.169 --> 01:12:39.399
Daddy!

01:12:39.472 --> 01:12:43.932
Let go of my baby!

01:12:46.513 --> 01:12:48.378
No!

01:12:51.118 --> 01:12:54.451
Oh, it's true.

01:13:11.205 --> 01:13:14.107
It wasn't your fault.

01:13:14.176 --> 01:13:16.667
- I wasn't there.
- No, you were just--

01:13:16.745 --> 01:13:18.713
You were out doing your job.

01:13:18.781 --> 01:13:23.548
- I wasn't fucking there!
- Oh, look at you. Torn apart by guilt.

01:13:23.619 --> 01:13:27.681
You didn't do anything wrong. You were
an honest cop. You didn't take money.

01:13:27.757 --> 01:13:31.124
You had to testify against them even
after they threatened your family.

01:13:31.194 --> 01:13:33.219
Most people would never
testify against those guys.

01:13:33.296 --> 01:13:35.491
They're not like you.
You had to do the right thing.

01:13:35.565 --> 01:13:37.931
And where was God, hmm?

01:13:38.001 --> 01:13:40.993
He could've stopped it, but he didn't. He
fucked you. Then He made you feel guilty.

01:13:41.071 --> 01:13:44.098
Me, I don't do guilt.
I didn't do what happened here.

01:13:44.175 --> 01:13:47.440
He did.
Now you just think about that.

01:13:47.511 --> 01:13:49.445
Then you tell me
who's really your friend.

01:13:49.513 --> 01:13:52.038
I can make it like it never happened.

01:13:52.116 --> 01:13:54.949
<i>All for the price</i>
<i>of a stranger's address.</i>

01:13:56.355 --> 01:13:58.482
No!

01:14:00.092 --> 01:14:02.083
You will never see the girl!

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:05.561
Now, you see--
Now you're upsetting me.

01:14:05.630 --> 01:14:08.360
You don't want
to see me upset, believe me.

01:14:08.433 --> 01:14:11.699
Oh, you want to fuck with me?
You think you know bad, huh?

01:14:11.771 --> 01:14:15.468
You're a fucking choirboy
compared to me! A choirboy!

01:14:15.541 --> 01:14:18.476
You're in touch with your anger.
I really like that.

01:14:18.544 --> 01:14:21.513
I don't know about you,
but I'm going to have a drink.

01:14:21.581 --> 01:14:24.573
You and I are so much alike.

01:14:24.651 --> 01:14:27.449
We're nothing alike!
Nothing!

01:14:27.521 --> 01:14:31.116
Look at yourself. Look at this.
Look at what you are now.

01:14:31.191 --> 01:14:34.490
You walked away from the light,
just like me. You want one?

01:14:34.561 --> 01:14:38.965
- You need to get out, now.
- Come on. You know what's in your heart.

01:14:39.034 --> 01:14:42.492
<i>We're on the same side.</i>
I'm not on your side, and I never will be.

01:14:42.570 --> 01:14:46.631
You're on His side?
He's the one who took away your family.

01:14:46.708 --> 01:14:48.767
Let me tell you something about Him.

01:14:48.843 --> 01:14:52.108
He is the biggest underachiever
of all time.

01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:56.914
He just had a good publicist, that's all.
Something good happens: "It's His will."

01:14:56.986 --> 01:15:00.217
Something bad happens:
"He moves in mysterious ways."

01:15:00.289 --> 01:15:03.258
You take that-- that overblown
press kit they call the Bible.

01:15:03.325 --> 01:15:05.316
<i>You look for the answer in there,</i>
<i>what do they tell you?</i>

01:15:05.394 --> 01:15:09.024
"Shit happens."
 Please.

01:15:09.099 --> 01:15:13.035
He treated you like garbage.
You walked away.

01:15:13.103 --> 01:15:16.402
I'm not the bad guy.

01:15:16.473 --> 01:15:18.668
What about the End of Days?

01:15:18.742 --> 01:15:21.074
Think of it as a new beginning.

01:15:21.144 --> 01:15:24.706
A change of management. And you'll be
right there with me on the ground floor.

01:15:24.782 --> 01:15:28.047
It will be so cool.

01:15:28.119 --> 01:15:30.053
Tell me what you want.

01:15:30.121 --> 01:15:33.113
Tell me what you really want,
and I'll give it to you.

01:15:37.129 --> 01:15:39.723
I'll tell you what I want.

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:45.001
I want you to go to hell.

01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:49.439
You see, sometimes the problem is...

01:15:51.544 --> 01:15:54.035
hell...

01:15:54.114 --> 01:15:56.605
comes to you!

01:16:09.979 --> 01:16:12.777
Don't fuck up the coat.

01:16:15.251 --> 01:16:17.344
I've wasted
too much time on this.

01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:20.948
You see those insignificant little dots
down there? Huh? Do you see them?

01:16:21.025 --> 01:16:24.517
That's what you mean to me.
Now, give me the girl!

01:16:24.595 --> 01:16:26.688
Not today.

01:16:51.958 --> 01:16:54.426
Look down.

01:16:54.494 --> 01:16:59.295
Now, look in your heart and tell me
you don't want to die.

01:16:59.365 --> 01:17:01.265
All you got to do is take my hand.

01:17:01.334 --> 01:17:04.429
And I'll give you back
everything that He took away.

01:17:08.342 --> 01:17:10.970
- Come on.
- Okay.

01:17:11.044 --> 01:17:15.947
<i>Okay. Okay. Okay.</i>

01:17:23.525 --> 01:17:25.584
Fuck... you!

01:18:13.412 --> 01:18:15.403
Hey.
Hey!

01:18:17.082 --> 01:18:19.482
- I thought you were dead.
- Couple of seconds, I would've been.

01:18:19.551 --> 01:18:22.952
All I remember is steppin' out of the van,
then I woke up in the fucking gutter.

01:18:23.021 --> 01:18:25.854
What the hell are you doing here?
What are you talking about?

01:18:25.924 --> 01:18:29.258
<i>I've been lookin' for you all night.</i>
<i>What the hell happened to you?</i>

01:18:32.599 --> 01:18:35.159
- Hey. Hey. Hey.
- I can't trust you.

01:18:35.235 --> 01:18:39.035
I don't know how much you had to drink,
okay, but let's not point the gun at me?

01:18:39.105 --> 01:18:41.130
I just need to know.
You need to know what?

01:18:41.207 --> 01:18:44.974
That you are you. Of course I'm me!
What the hell are you talking about?

01:18:47.748 --> 01:18:50.546
You took his body.
All right. You're ill.

01:18:50.618 --> 01:18:53.451
Okay?
You need some help. All right?

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.045
Oh, fuck!
Jesus!

01:18:56.124 --> 01:18:58.388
- Fuck.
- You're bleeding.

01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:00.860
Of course I'm bleeding!
You fuckin' shot me!

01:19:00.929 --> 01:19:04.228
I just needed to find out!
You found out, okay?

01:19:04.299 --> 01:19:07.826
Stop being such a pussy!
It's just a scratch. Pussy? Come on!

01:19:07.902 --> 01:19:10.428
Oh, Christ.
Does it hurt?

01:19:10.506 --> 01:19:12.872
What do you think?
Jesus.

01:19:12.942 --> 01:19:15.604
What the hell's the matter with you?
What's going on here?

01:19:15.678 --> 01:19:17.646
I can't explain it.

01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:24.078
I shouldn't have left
her alone like that.

01:19:24.153 --> 01:19:27.851
- I should be with her.
<i>- Tell me what to do.</i>

01:19:27.924 --> 01:19:30.085
I gotta get back there.

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:32.560
Got to get her as far away
from him as I can.

01:19:32.629 --> 01:19:35.496
Okay, we'll leave town.
You get her. I'll get a Striker car.

01:19:35.565 --> 01:19:37.556
Just tell me where to meet you.

01:19:44.208 --> 01:19:47.336
St. John's Church... in one hour.

01:19:52.984 --> 01:19:55.681
<i>How much longer, Father?</i>

01:19:55.754 --> 01:20:00.020
Well, he has to sire his child between
11:00 and midnight tomorrow night.

01:20:00.092 --> 01:20:03.721
So, we must keep you hidden until
that hour passes.

01:20:08.902 --> 01:20:12.360
We've come to help.
Your Eminence.

01:20:12.439 --> 01:20:15.875
In this hour of darkness,
we need all the help we can get.

01:20:18.545 --> 01:20:21.811
How's the girl?
The girl's fine. Thanks.

01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:28.313
No.

01:20:28.389 --> 01:20:31.552
No. Father! Father, they're the ones
who tried to kill me!

01:20:34.061 --> 01:20:36.189
- No!
- <i>Your Eminence, what are you doing?</i>

01:20:36.264 --> 01:20:38.357
<i>We cannot allow this union to take place.</i>
<i>No! No.</i>

01:20:38.433 --> 01:20:39.798
Please!
<i>You can't! You mustn't!</i>

01:20:39.868 --> 01:20:42.803
<i>- Let go!</i>
- She is only one life.

01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:45.237
<i>How many lives are you prepared</i>
<i>to end if we do nothing?</i>

01:20:45.307 --> 01:20:47.298
- That's not who we are.
- Of course it is.

01:20:47.376 --> 01:20:50.676
We are doing God's work.
We are preventing the End of Days.

01:20:50.747 --> 01:20:54.308
But you can't prevent evil
by doing evil.

01:20:54.384 --> 01:20:56.375
- There is no time!
- No!

01:20:56.452 --> 01:20:58.477
- It's the only way.
- <i>No-o-o!</i>

01:20:58.554 --> 01:21:00.317
<i>May God forgive us!</i>

01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:02.324
Amen.

01:21:07.464 --> 01:21:10.456
I can do this all day long.

01:21:10.534 --> 01:21:13.094
Now, let her go.

01:21:13.170 --> 01:21:15.229
You must let us finish.

01:21:15.305 --> 01:21:18.969
<i>If she is slain, his hope of creating</i>
<i>a kingdom on Earth dies with her.</i>

01:21:19.043 --> 01:21:21.910
<i>- Her death is God's will.</i>
- It's not God's will.

01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:24.107
<i>It's your will, and it will</i>
<i>lead to our destruction.</i> Jericho.

01:21:24.182 --> 01:21:26.742
<i>She must be removed.</i>
<i>It's the only way to defeat him.</i>

01:21:26.818 --> 01:21:30.117
For a thousand years,
we prepared ourselves for this.

01:21:30.188 --> 01:21:33.021
We're not afraid to die.
Good.

01:21:33.091 --> 01:21:35.185
Because I'm not afraid to kill you.

01:21:35.261 --> 01:21:37.559
Let her go.

01:21:55.907 --> 01:21:58.034
Go. Go.
Get out of here.

01:21:59.778 --> 01:22:01.872
<i>Go!</i>

01:22:08.321 --> 01:22:11.415
God help us.
We're too late.

01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:17.392
- I've come for my wife.
- Let's go.

01:22:17.464 --> 01:22:20.297
<i>This is the house of the Lord, our God,</i>
<i>and you are not welcome here.</i>

01:22:21.969 --> 01:22:26.872
I can stand the pain of being in church.
How much pain can you bear?

01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:29.738
Christine!
Come to me.

01:22:29.810 --> 01:22:32.405
<i>I am the one</i>
<i>you've been waiting for.</i>

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:34.573
I am the answer to your prayers.

01:22:34.649 --> 01:22:37.618
In the name of God,
I order you to leave here now!

01:22:42.357 --> 01:22:45.452
<i>May the wrath of God destroy--</i>

01:23:09.052 --> 01:23:13.854
A thousand years you have waited for
my return. And behold, you have failed.

01:23:13.925 --> 01:23:18.988
And with your last breath you shall
bear witness to the End of Days.

01:23:41.754 --> 01:23:44.519
No! Jericho!

01:23:52.232 --> 01:23:54.200
Get in the car!
Run!

01:23:56.971 --> 01:23:59.064
Jesus! Come on!

01:24:10.452 --> 01:24:13.046
Bobby, what the hell are you doing?

01:24:13.121 --> 01:24:15.248
What are you doing?
Open the door! <i>Open up!</i>

01:24:15.323 --> 01:24:17.348
- Come on! Open up!
- Open the door!

01:24:19.461 --> 01:24:23.454
Jer--
Please, stop the car! Please!

01:24:33.075 --> 01:24:35.543
Jer!

01:25:15.354 --> 01:25:17.879
Jer!

01:25:57.866 --> 01:25:59.800
<i>You should have taken my offer.</i>

01:25:59.868 --> 01:26:02.666
<i>At least you would have</i>
<i>been happy once in your life.</i>

01:26:09.212 --> 01:26:12.978
Let her go, or I'll kill you.

01:26:13.049 --> 01:26:15.916
Ooh, so much anger, so much hatred.

01:26:15.985 --> 01:26:18.317
You're almost there.

01:26:23.627 --> 01:26:27.791
I'm gonna hurt you so bad,
you're gonna beg to die.

01:26:27.865 --> 01:26:31.801
But I'm not gonna let you.
It's not gonna be that easy.

01:26:31.869 --> 01:26:36.830
You're mine, and I want you
to see what's gonna happen.

01:27:32.862 --> 01:27:35.490
<i>World religious
leaders have asked their followers...</i>

01:27:35.565 --> 01:27:39.194
<i>to prepare for the new millennium not</i>
<i>with celebrating and partying...</i>

01:27:39.268 --> 01:27:41.736
<i>but rather with acts</i>
<i>of kindness, compassion--</i>

01:27:41.804 --> 01:27:46.299
<i>This is it, New York.</i>
<i>The last day of the first 2,000 years.</i>

01:28:57.286 --> 01:29:02.121
- How long have I been out?
- You almost slept the whole day.

01:29:02.191 --> 01:29:05.285
You're lucky to be alive.

01:29:14.370 --> 01:29:16.304
The time?

01:29:16.372 --> 01:29:19.603
It's almost 7:00.
It's not too late.

01:29:19.676 --> 01:29:22.839
He has the girl.
But it's not too late.

01:29:25.382 --> 01:29:29.216
<i>In nomine Patris,</i>
<i>et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

01:29:52.077 --> 01:29:55.809
<i>Jesus, what did you do?</i>
<i>Get hit by a truck?</i>

01:29:55.882 --> 01:29:57.941
No, the truck missed me.

01:30:25.847 --> 01:30:28.873
Where the hell are you goin'?
Doing my job.

01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:31.077
<i>You know, the cops are after you.</i>

01:30:31.152 --> 01:30:33.086
<i>They have to wait.</i>
<i>I've got to do something.</i>

01:30:41.897 --> 01:30:44.127
That son of a bitch.

01:32:18.901 --> 01:32:23.133
Yes.
You wish entrance?

01:32:25.174 --> 01:32:31.011
You have much hatred
and vengeance in your heart.

01:32:31.081 --> 01:32:33.447
You may pass.

01:34:09.715 --> 01:34:12.048
<i>Angelus obscurus.</i>

01:34:12.118 --> 01:34:15.212
<i>Angelus obscurus.</i>

01:34:16.289 --> 01:34:20.248
Princeps finis dierum.

01:34:20.326 --> 01:34:23.227
<i>Princeps finis dierum.</i>

01:35:05.408 --> 01:35:07.775
You know this is what you want.

01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:20.350
Angelus obscurus.

01:35:20.424 --> 01:35:22.757
Angelus obscurus.

01:35:22.827 --> 01:35:26.285
Angelus obscurus.

01:35:26.364 --> 01:35:30.767
You can't resist, can you?
'Cause you don't want to.

01:35:33.838 --> 01:35:38.538
I didn't come here to hurt you.
I came here to love you.

01:35:41.814 --> 01:35:45.875
Relax.
Give yourself to me.

01:36:14.315 --> 01:36:16.783
- No one move, or I kill the girl.
- What are you doing?

01:36:16.851 --> 01:36:19.787
- Trust me.
- You're not gonna kill her.

01:36:19.855 --> 01:36:22.085
<i>You said it yourself.</i>
<i>I have a dark heart.</i>

01:36:22.157 --> 01:36:24.557
- Then stand with me.
- I'll tell you what.

01:36:24.626 --> 01:36:29.529
<i>You let us both out of here,</i>
<i>and I'll stand wherever you want.</i>

01:36:29.598 --> 01:36:32.999
- Step back, or I'll pull the trigger.
- I didn't want to kill you.

01:36:33.068 --> 01:36:35.003
<i>But now you leave me no choice.</i>

01:36:42.312 --> 01:36:45.611
Let her go, Jer.

01:36:45.682 --> 01:36:47.617
<i>Oh, don't look at me like that.</i>

01:36:47.685 --> 01:36:49.710
You'd be amazed what you agree to
when you're on fire.

01:36:49.787 --> 01:36:53.120
Don't do it, Bobby.
You're better than this.

01:36:53.190 --> 01:36:56.421
You're better than him. You know,
considering how you've lived your life,

01:36:56.493 --> 01:37:00.623
when this is all over, what makes you
think you're going upstairs anyways, huh?

01:37:00.698 --> 01:37:04.635
Come on, Jer. This is the main event.
It's gonna happen.

01:37:04.703 --> 01:37:06.869
Why shouldn't you have the
best seats in the house?

01:37:06.895 --> 01:37:10.673
You will never get a shot
off, and you know it.

01:37:14.079 --> 01:37:15.979
Don't do it.

01:37:18.884 --> 01:37:22.479
<i>Bobby.</i>

01:37:22.555 --> 01:37:24.785
I thought we had a deal?

01:37:24.857 --> 01:37:27.155
<i>Bobby.</i>

01:37:45.646 --> 01:37:48.740
Well, I guess the deal's off.

01:37:55.390 --> 01:37:57.688
No!

01:38:00.162 --> 01:38:02.392
You son of a bitch!

01:38:33.998 --> 01:38:36.558
Here!
This way!

01:38:49.781 --> 01:38:51.715
Up here.

01:39:02.528 --> 01:39:04.928
Shit!

01:39:31.492 --> 01:39:34.620
- Oh, thank God. I thought I hit you.
- Just get us out of here!

01:39:39.434 --> 01:39:41.163
Let's go.
Give me a minute.

01:39:42.904 --> 01:39:46.237
I'd feel better if you'd show me how
to use one of those things.

01:39:46.308 --> 01:39:50.711
- <i>I want to do something. Let me help.</i>
- All right. Here.

01:39:50.779 --> 01:39:54.011
You take the gun.
Line up the sight with your target.

01:39:54.083 --> 01:39:56.643
Uh-huh. Beware of the recoil.
Here's the magazine.

01:39:56.719 --> 01:39:58.846
Put it in. Load.

01:39:58.921 --> 01:40:01.685
Only pull the trigger when you're ready--

01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:06.528
Like that?
Yeah, like that.

01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:30.945
He's on the tracks!

01:40:32.090 --> 01:40:33.853
Shit!

01:40:33.925 --> 01:40:36.588
- Don't stop! Don't stop!
- What are you doing?

01:40:56.850 --> 01:40:58.477
He's gone.

01:41:51.175 --> 01:41:53.006
Oh, God.

01:41:55.579 --> 01:41:57.308
Go on.

01:42:03.188 --> 01:42:05.986
We must separate the cars.
Separate the cars. What?

01:42:27.146 --> 01:42:29.341
Jericho!

01:42:31.385 --> 01:42:33.250
Jericho!

01:42:44.498 --> 01:42:48.060
Jericho!

01:42:56.110 --> 01:42:58.840
That's it. Come on.

01:43:06.355 --> 01:43:08.550
Jericho!

01:43:48.733 --> 01:43:50.997
Here. Hold on!

01:44:45.794 --> 01:44:48.820
Jericho!

01:44:48.898 --> 01:44:53.302
<i>How can you expect to defeat me</i>
<i>when you are but a man...</i>

01:44:53.370 --> 01:44:57.306
and I am forever!

01:45:35.013 --> 01:45:37.676
We must lock the doors!

01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:51.094
<i>- Deliver us, O Lord.</i>
<i>- Everyone, out!</i>

01:45:51.165 --> 01:45:53.757
<i>Get them to a safe place!</i>
<i>Get them out of here!</i>

01:46:10.477 --> 01:46:12.911
<i>Lady, come on!</i>

01:46:22.457 --> 01:46:24.891
What are we gonna do?

01:46:30.031 --> 01:46:33.194
Hide. Just hide!
No.

01:47:49.216 --> 01:47:53.016
Please, God, help me.

01:47:54.288 --> 01:47:56.882
Give me strength.

01:51:00.087 --> 01:51:02.487
Christine.

01:51:02.556 --> 01:51:04.581
Christine?

01:51:04.658 --> 01:51:07.924
Jericho?

01:51:12.467 --> 01:51:14.628
Are you all right?

01:51:14.702 --> 01:51:18.536
What happened?
It's over.

01:51:18.606 --> 01:51:21.075
We won.

01:51:21.143 --> 01:51:22.770
We won.

01:51:27.383 --> 01:51:29.510
Let's go.

01:51:32.321 --> 01:51:34.222
Huh?

01:51:37.694 --> 01:51:41.858
- What's wrong?
- Nothing is wrong.

01:51:43.833 --> 01:51:47.030
Everything is the way it should be.

01:51:47.103 --> 01:51:50.835
No! Jericho! No! No!

01:51:50.908 --> 01:51:53.433
No, please!
What are you doing?

01:51:53.511 --> 01:51:56.071
Jericho!
No!

01:51:56.147 --> 01:51:58.206
No!

01:52:00.818 --> 01:52:03.549
No! Stop it!

01:52:06.692 --> 01:52:10.128
You died for nothing.
You just bought them time.

01:52:10.195 --> 01:52:13.756
<i>Please. You have to fight him, Jericho.</i>
<i>I know you.</i>

01:52:13.832 --> 01:52:16.961
You're stronger than he is.

01:52:18.404 --> 01:52:21.430
That's why you came back for me.
Don't let him win.

01:52:56.585 --> 01:52:58.485
Run.

01:52:59.822 --> 01:53:02.848
Run.

01:53:08.998 --> 01:53:11.330
- Yah!
- No!

01:53:13.670 --> 01:53:15.968
<i>Six, five, four,</i>

01:53:16.039 --> 01:53:19.668

<i>Daddy?</i>

01:55:08.393 --> 01:55:10.384
