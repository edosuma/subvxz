00:04.738 --> 00:06.171
[Candace] Who's my lovely bride?

00:06.206 --> 00:07.439
Who else?

00:07.474 --> 00:10.275
The dress must be found today

00:10.310 --> 00:12.678
or I'm SOL.

00:12.712 --> 00:14.480
<i>Hello, beautiful.</i>

00:14.514 --> 00:16.715
- Randy?
<i>- Yes.</i>

00:16.750 --> 00:18.550
I usually only hear you on TV.

00:18.585 --> 00:20.352
You're completely blind, right?

00:20.387 --> 00:21.420
Completely blind.

00:21.454 --> 00:23.389
[Kellie] Shaela. Oh, my God.

00:23.423 --> 00:25.491
This one is very, very romantic.

00:25.525 --> 00:26.859
But where's the sexy?

00:26.893 --> 00:28.927
I don't know if I'm gonna be
able to get a dress

00:28.962 --> 00:31.463
<i>where my mom is not gonna
approve of it.</i>

00:31.498 --> 00:32.831
So I'm a little bit worried
about that.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.167
[Candace] There has to be
something here.

00:35.201 --> 00:36.568
This is a no.

00:36.603 --> 00:38.237
These last-minute brides

00:38.271 --> 00:39.571
send me on a whirlwind.

00:39.606 --> 00:40.939
- Mom's making a face.
- Mom?

00:40.973 --> 00:43.742
I have a little bit
of a reservation right here.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.778
- [Shaela] Of what?
- [Lisa] About this?

00:45.812 --> 00:48.180
- We'll deal with your mother.
- Okay.

00:48.214 --> 00:49.181
[Shameika] Oh.

00:50.583 --> 00:52.551
Hey, I like that one
way better than the first one.

00:52.585 --> 00:55.220
Now the first one
is a definite no?

00:55.255 --> 00:56.455
Yeah. I'm telling you now.

00:56.489 --> 00:58.490
I didn't like it,
but I like this one.

00:58.525 --> 01:01.193
You should have been honest
when I first came out.

01:01.227 --> 01:02.361
<i>It's down to the wire.</i>

01:02.395 --> 01:05.164
I am feeling like what the hell.

01:09.602 --> 01:12.304
[upbeat music playing]

01:15.575 --> 01:18.944
Okay. Let me call Randy.

01:22.782 --> 01:25.684
Is that Chewie? Oh, yeah.
Chill, boo-boo.

01:25.718 --> 01:28.320
Come here, you wanna play
with daddy?

01:28.354 --> 01:30.122
- [Dorothy] Randy?
- Oh.

01:32.225 --> 01:34.893
<i>Oh, Dorothy, I'm here.</i>

01:34.928 --> 01:35.828
- How you doing?
- [Dorothy] Listen,

01:35.862 --> 01:37.629
we got the new dresses
and I wanna show you

01:37.664 --> 01:40.432
- and go over some of them.
- Yay.

01:40.467 --> 01:42.501
<i>I know I'm still working
with brides every day</i>

01:42.535 --> 01:44.536
as fashion director
but I really wish

01:44.571 --> 01:46.271
I was there in person
to show the dresses

01:46.306 --> 01:48.340
to all the consultants.

01:48.374 --> 01:49.541
I wish you were, too.

01:49.576 --> 01:52.377
But, as soon as we've finished
the renovations

01:52.412 --> 01:53.745
that are going on in my house...

01:53.780 --> 01:56.281
- [Dorothy]<i> Okay.</i>
- [Randy]<i> ...I'm coming back.</i>

01:56.316 --> 01:57.449
[Dorothy]<i> Great.</i>

01:57.484 --> 02:00.652
So, the first one we got
and I absolutely adore.

02:00.687 --> 02:02.988
- That's Bentley. Very simple.
- [Dorothy]<i> It's beautiful.</i>

02:03.022 --> 02:05.324
[Randy]<i> That dress is doing</i>
<i>really, really well</i>

02:05.358 --> 02:06.492
<i>in Europe, by the way.</i>

02:06.526 --> 02:08.293
[Dorothy] It's elegant
and timeless.

02:08.328 --> 02:10.229
This one I'm obsessed with.

02:10.263 --> 02:11.730
I love the slit.

02:11.764 --> 02:13.465
I love everything
about this dress.

02:13.500 --> 02:18.303
Isn't the back, like,
absolutely sexy, sexy, sexy?

02:18.338 --> 02:20.038
And then we have Betsy.

02:20.073 --> 02:21.373
[Randy]<i> Betsy is a</i> great dress
because I think

02:21.407 --> 02:23.775
<i>it looks really great
on a curvy girl.</i>

02:23.810 --> 02:25.577
<i>Oh, there goes Chewie.
He hears the guys downstairs.</i>

02:25.612 --> 02:27.446
- [Dorothy] Chewie?
- [Randy]<i> Yeah.</i>

02:27.480 --> 02:28.580
<i>He hears my workers
working on the house.</i>

02:28.615 --> 02:30.516
<i>He's watching out for me.</i>

02:30.550 --> 02:32.417
<i>Good boy.</i>

02:32.452 --> 02:34.686
I love you and send all
the girls and the consultants

02:34.721 --> 02:37.189
and Mara and Ronnie my love,
okay?

02:37.223 --> 02:38.323
I certainly will. Mwah.

02:38.358 --> 02:41.527
- Okay. Mwah, bye-bye.
- Bye. Bye.

02:41.561 --> 02:43.195
[upbeat music playing]

02:44.831 --> 02:47.399
We are heading
to the airport in Atlanta.

02:47.433 --> 02:50.402
My fiance is about
to drop me off.

02:50.436 --> 02:52.838
- Yes.
- Okay, now, be careful.

02:52.872 --> 02:55.741
<i>Dalen, my fiance,
is a TV personality.</i>

02:55.775 --> 02:59.378
He hunts ghosts for a living
on the hit show,

02:59.412 --> 03:01.747
The Ghost Brothers.

03:01.781 --> 03:04.783
<i>Dalen proposed right before
New Year's,</i>

03:04.817 --> 03:07.653
and I knew I didn't wanna wait
long to get married.

03:07.687 --> 03:10.689
So, I immediately started
planning the wedding

03:10.723 --> 03:13.692
and found my ceremony dress.

03:13.726 --> 03:16.328
<i>And then my fiance, he's, like,</i>

03:16.362 --> 03:17.529
"Hey, I'm wearing two tuxedos."

03:17.564 --> 03:18.830
So it's like a competition.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.333
<i>So, of course, I have
to keep up with him</i>

03:21.367 --> 03:22.401
<i>and have two dresses.</i>

03:22.435 --> 03:24.169
Typical man.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.972
[upbeat music playing]

03:31.477 --> 03:33.378
Ooh, that's really pretty.

03:38.518 --> 03:43.455
I am here to find the dress
for my reception.

03:43.489 --> 03:46.592
Oh, hmm, oh, oh, cupcake.

03:46.626 --> 03:49.528
<i>I don't have much time
before my wedding,</i>

03:49.562 --> 03:53.298
but I feel like Kleinfeld
has a lot of dresses

03:53.333 --> 03:54.766
and one has my name on it.

03:54.801 --> 03:56.735
But once you say yes
to this dress, honey,

03:56.769 --> 03:58.503
then we got to say yes
to a hairpiece

03:58.538 --> 03:59.738
- and say yes to...
- Yes. Yeah.

03:59.772 --> 04:02.307
- It's yes, yes, and yes.
- ...yes to a veil.

04:02.342 --> 04:04.109
[Candace] Hello, ladies.

04:04.143 --> 04:05.244
Hi.

04:05.278 --> 04:07.246
Hi, beautiful ladies.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.748
How are you? So excited.

04:09.782 --> 04:13.285
- Who's my lovely bride?
- I mean, who else?

04:13.319 --> 04:14.453
[Candace] Hello.

04:14.487 --> 04:16.288
I got to remind the people.

04:16.322 --> 04:17.489
I gotta let them know.

04:17.523 --> 04:18.624
Notice.

04:18.658 --> 04:19.891
[Candace] Yeah, these two?

04:19.926 --> 04:22.661
Yeah, because sometimes
they think they're the bride

04:22.695 --> 04:23.495
- and I have to remind them.
- We are.

04:23.529 --> 04:25.764
Because we are all saying yes.

04:25.798 --> 04:28.367
These are my best friends,
Aikisha and Shameika.

04:28.401 --> 04:29.401
- Hi.
- [Candace] Nice to meet you.

04:29.435 --> 04:31.203
Nice to meet you.

04:31.237 --> 04:32.437
Tell me about the wedding.

04:32.472 --> 04:35.240
So, the wedding
is in Atlanta, Georgia.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.375
At Ashton Gardens.

04:36.409 --> 04:37.542
Everyone will be wearing
black...

04:37.577 --> 04:39.077
- [Candace] Mmm-hmm.
- ...except me.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.545
- [Candace] I love black.
- Uninterrupted black,

04:40.580 --> 04:42.347
- all black everything.
- All black everything.

04:42.382 --> 04:44.683
Socks, everything, all black.
Yeah.

04:44.717 --> 04:46.618
So, what kind of dress
are we thinking?

04:46.653 --> 04:49.288
So, I'm really open because

04:49.322 --> 04:50.656
this will be my reception dress.

04:50.690 --> 04:53.892
Okay. Is the ceremony
already like a ball gown?

04:53.926 --> 04:57.629
[Stacey]<i> The ceremony</i>
<i>is actually fitted and lace,</i>

04:57.664 --> 05:00.565
<i>and it has lots of drama to it.</i>

05:00.600 --> 05:02.634
- So I want something romantic.
- [Candace] Mmm-hmm.

05:02.669 --> 05:05.637
I want it to fit, you know,
I want some flow to it.

05:05.672 --> 05:07.906
I'm willing to try on, I mean,

05:07.940 --> 05:08.807
a little bit of everything,
honestly.

05:08.841 --> 05:10.442
[Candace] Okay.
You ready to get started?

05:10.476 --> 05:11.643
- I'm ready. I'm ready.
- All right.

05:11.678 --> 05:12.477
Let's go walk around,

05:12.512 --> 05:13.578
I want you to show me, like,

05:13.613 --> 05:16.315
one or two dresses that you see.

05:16.349 --> 05:17.382
I am a perfectionist.

05:17.417 --> 05:18.684
I'm an event planner.

05:18.718 --> 05:21.420
<i>This dress is a part of my plan.</i>

05:21.454 --> 05:23.422
So that makes it
a little tougher.

05:23.456 --> 05:25.590
[Candace] So, do you have
a budget in mind?

05:25.625 --> 05:27.526
[Stacey] So I wanna stay
at $4,000.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.827
- [Candace] Okay.
- But I feel like

05:28.861 --> 05:31.596
my best friends are gonna
tell me the truth.

05:31.631 --> 05:33.432
<i>They're gonna be honest with me.</i>

05:33.466 --> 05:34.766
<i>And, I mean,
they know me the best,</i>

05:34.801 --> 05:38.370
we've known each other
our entire lives.

05:38.404 --> 05:39.471
[Candace] When is the wedding?

05:39.505 --> 05:42.274
Oh, it's six weeks away.

05:42.308 --> 05:43.608
Oh, my gosh. Okay.

05:43.643 --> 05:46.678
Well, now, I'm gonna run
and have a violent panic

05:46.713 --> 05:48.613
- by myself.
- And I'll be waiting.

05:48.648 --> 05:50.582
- [Candace] Okay.
- Okay.

05:50.616 --> 05:54.219
These last-minute brides
send me on a whirlwind.

05:54.253 --> 05:55.520
This is my secret stockroom.

05:55.555 --> 05:56.955
All of these gowns,

05:56.989 --> 05:59.391
she can take home
with her today.

05:59.425 --> 06:02.527
The only challenge
is finding a stock piece

06:02.562 --> 06:04.629
that's actually gonna be
the right style

06:04.664 --> 06:08.767
and the right size.
So I'm really under pressure.

06:08.801 --> 06:10.302
- All right.
- Two to start with

06:10.336 --> 06:11.503
that I really want you to see.

06:11.537 --> 06:13.438
[Stacey] So, I don't care
for this one.

06:13.473 --> 06:14.673
Okay. Keep in mind,

06:14.707 --> 06:15.807
they don't always have
hanger appeal,

06:15.842 --> 06:17.642
but when you have it
on your body...

06:17.677 --> 06:18.777
- [Stacey] Exactly.
- ...it changes your life.

06:18.811 --> 06:21.780
I do love this one.
I think this looks--

06:21.814 --> 06:24.383
Because I like--
I think I like the texture...

06:24.417 --> 06:25.617
- [Candace] Mmm-hmm.
- ...and it's different.

06:25.651 --> 06:28.120
[Candace] Okay, let's do it.

06:30.523 --> 06:34.059
This dress is one of my
favorite silhouettes.

06:34.093 --> 06:36.661
<i>It has that beautiful
plunging neckline,</i>

06:36.696 --> 06:38.797
<i>it has the flowy bottom
that she really likes.</i>

06:38.831 --> 06:42.501
And it's all about
the details of this dress.

06:42.535 --> 06:45.370
- Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.
- Mmm-hmm Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.140
[upbeat music playing]

06:51.411 --> 06:53.545
- Oh, my God.
- It looks like a yes.

06:53.579 --> 06:54.713
- Yeah.
- [Shameika] Yeah.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.381
See, I like all this
stuff in here.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.449
- I love it.
- [Stacey] Let me show you

06:57.483 --> 06:59.618
- the back first.
- Yes.

06:59.652 --> 07:01.620
- Honey, I love all of that.
- That's beautiful.

07:01.654 --> 07:03.121
Look at that booty.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.424
[laughter]

07:06.826 --> 07:09.561
Mmm-hmm. I'm squeezed,
I'm squeezed in.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.463
- [Aikisha] That's okay.
- [Shameika] But it looks good.

07:11.497 --> 07:12.531
[Aikisha] It looks good, though.

07:12.565 --> 07:14.332
[Stacey] I love the color.

07:14.367 --> 07:15.400
I love the flowers.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.701
[Aikisha] Yes, the details.

07:16.736 --> 07:18.770
- [Stacey] I like the details.
- [Aikisha] Mmm-hmm.

07:18.805 --> 07:19.738
[Aikisha] I wish it was
a little lower right here.

07:19.772 --> 07:21.473
We can't get it cut down
to, like, right there?

07:21.507 --> 07:23.275
- Of course you want it lower.
- Oh, my goodness.

07:23.309 --> 07:24.743
[Stacey] Aikisha, I don't want
my whole back out.

07:24.777 --> 07:27.312
[Aikisha]
You have a beautiful back.

07:27.346 --> 07:29.748
Listen, I just asked.

07:29.782 --> 07:31.483
- [Stacey] Yes.
- I wanna see another one.

07:31.517 --> 07:32.617
- [Stacey] Of course you do.
- Okay.

07:32.652 --> 07:34.686
[Aikisha] That's her. Okay.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.354
- I like it, though.
- It's pretty.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.656
[Stacey] I know, it is,
it's real pretty.

07:37.690 --> 07:40.292
- I didn't like it.
- No. No.

07:40.326 --> 07:42.160
It is-- It was
a beautiful dress.

07:42.195 --> 07:43.595
[Aikisha] Yes.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.297
[Shameika] But that was not
the dress.

07:45.331 --> 07:47.632
I'm just always the cheerleader.

07:47.667 --> 07:50.168
No matter what,
I'm a cheerleader.

07:52.405 --> 07:54.206
Yes, body.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.674
It feels good.

07:55.708 --> 07:57.709
I feel like my body
looks good in it.

07:57.743 --> 08:00.612
So, I knew they would love it.

08:00.646 --> 08:03.748
[Aikisha speaking]

08:03.783 --> 08:06.251
[upbeat music playing]

08:06.285 --> 08:08.353
[woman] Oh, I'm so happy.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.590
- [Alex] Hi, Randy.
- [Randy]<i> Hello, beautiful.</i>

08:11.624 --> 08:13.358
- How are you?
- [Alex]<i> I'm good.</i>

08:13.392 --> 08:16.328
<i>- How are you?</i>
- Living the dream, honey.

08:16.362 --> 08:17.529
I know, I hear that.

08:17.563 --> 08:19.331
So, I have a special bride here

08:19.365 --> 08:20.632
that's gonna be working
with Lisa,

08:20.666 --> 08:22.567
so I want you to come with me.
Let's go find her.

08:22.602 --> 08:24.636
<i>- Okay?</i>
- Okay, okay.

08:24.670 --> 08:27.506
<i>Like we do every day,</i>

08:27.540 --> 08:31.309
it's just I'm in an iPad
instead of in person.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.644
[Alex] Lisa.

08:32.678 --> 08:35.247
- [Lisa] Yes, coming.
- [Alex] Hi.

08:35.281 --> 08:36.648
Hi, beautiful. How are you?

08:36.682 --> 08:38.383
How are you and how is Chewie?

08:38.417 --> 08:39.718
He's great.

08:39.752 --> 08:41.920
He's actually sitting
right here beside me.

08:41.954 --> 08:44.289
- [Lisa]<i> Chew-Chew.</i>
- [Randy] Not gonna pick him up

08:44.323 --> 08:45.524
because he's gonna growl.

08:45.558 --> 08:47.492
So, I kind of wanna
fill you both in.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.327
We have a beautiful bride,
Shaela.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.429
She is coming in today
to find a dress.

08:51.464 --> 08:53.565
- She is blind.
- She's blind?

08:53.599 --> 08:54.833
- [Alex] Yes.
- [Randy]<i> Like,</i>

08:54.867 --> 08:57.702
<i>visually impaired
or completely blind?</i>

08:57.737 --> 09:01.106
I believe it's completely blind.

09:01.140 --> 09:02.607
Wow. So how is--

09:02.642 --> 09:05.343
How is she gonna shop
for a wedding dress?

09:05.378 --> 09:06.678
[woman] Feel this, feel it.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.413
[Shaela] Hmm, that one
feels like a

09:08.447 --> 09:10.549
circus, like a--

09:10.583 --> 09:12.384
Usually when I shop for clothes,

09:12.418 --> 09:14.719
whoever I'm with,
I really have to trust.

09:14.754 --> 09:17.923
So I kind of rely on them
to know what my style is

09:17.957 --> 09:20.525
based upon what I wear,
but, at the same time,

09:20.560 --> 09:22.627
texture is very important to me.

09:22.662 --> 09:24.396
[Kellie] This one's beautiful,
oh, my God.

09:24.430 --> 09:25.697
I really like this material.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.499
When I'm feeling a dress,

09:27.533 --> 09:29.434
<i>it's, just, if it's plain,</i>

09:29.468 --> 09:30.535
it's, kind of, boring to me.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.736
[Kellie] Reach down.
Do you feel that bottom?

09:31.771 --> 09:33.872
- [Shaela] Oh, gosh.
- [Kellie] It's feathers.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.774
- [Shaela] Wait, what?
- [Kellie] Yeah.

09:35.808 --> 09:37.642
Do you like something
similar to that?

09:37.677 --> 09:39.511
- You're not mad at it, huh?
- I'm not mad.

09:39.545 --> 09:41.413
Why is this happening?

09:41.447 --> 09:43.381
In almost 30 years
of doing bridal,

09:43.416 --> 09:45.383
I don't think I've ever worked

09:45.418 --> 09:47.452
with a bride
that's completely blind.

09:47.486 --> 09:50.789
<i>So I'm just, like,</i>

09:50.823 --> 09:52.824
how is she gonna choose
a dress without seeing it?

09:52.858 --> 09:54.659
So this one's gonna be
above your budget,

09:54.694 --> 09:55.694
but we can find something
similar to this.

09:55.728 --> 09:57.495
- And it's a sweetheart?
- [Kellie] Yes.

09:57.530 --> 09:58.630
[Lisa] So you're gonna leave
them here?

09:58.664 --> 10:00.332
Yes, I'm gonna leave them here.

10:00.366 --> 10:01.633
And then you're gonna go
get the Bride.

10:01.667 --> 10:04.302
- See you soon, Randy, okay?
- [Randy]<i> Okay, my love.</i>

10:04.337 --> 10:05.670
It's very heavy. So I don't know

10:05.705 --> 10:07.472
- how you're gonna like heavy.
- What do you think?

10:07.506 --> 10:09.474
Let's pull it out for her
and see if she wants--

10:09.508 --> 10:11.076
Pull it out so you can feel it

10:11.110 --> 10:12.477
in the front of it
and the bottom. Oh, wow.

10:12.511 --> 10:14.279
[Lisa] Where's my bride Shaela?

10:14.313 --> 10:16.648
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

10:16.682 --> 10:18.350
- Can I give you a hug?
- Yes, please.

10:18.384 --> 10:20.251
[Lisa] Shaela,
it's nice to meet you.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.386
- Yes. Lisa, right?
- [Lisa] Yes.

10:21.420 --> 10:22.721
- Yes, awesome.
- [Lisa] Welcome.

10:22.755 --> 10:23.655
- I'm so excited.
- Thank you.

10:23.689 --> 10:25.523
- Me too.
- And you ladies are?

10:25.558 --> 10:26.669
- This is also Lisa.
- I'm mom.

10:26.693 --> 10:28.259
[Lisa] Mom Lisa,
pleasure to meet you.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.394
- Yeah.
- Hi, I'm Kellie.

10:29.428 --> 10:30.662
Hi, Kellie,
pleasure to meet you.

10:30.696 --> 10:32.330
- She's my matron. Yes.
- Matron of honor.

10:32.365 --> 10:33.465
- Yes, that's me.
- Matron of honor, yes.

10:33.499 --> 10:34.532
- Fabulous.
- Yeah.

10:34.567 --> 10:36.434
- So, congratulations.
- [Shaela] Thank you.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.436
- When's the wedding?
- Wedding is in October,

10:38.471 --> 10:40.005
- late October.
- Very exciting.

10:40.039 --> 10:43.475
I'm so happy to be here
and to try on all the dresses

10:43.509 --> 10:46.378
and just take it all in.

10:46.412 --> 10:48.446
Well, I heard that you're blind.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.648
Yes. I'm totally blind.

10:49.682 --> 10:51.850
Just past my 10-year
anniversary in life.

10:51.884 --> 10:53.785
So you had sight prior to that?

10:53.819 --> 10:56.187
I did. Yes.
I had sight up till about

10:56.222 --> 10:58.590
15 and a half years.
It was less than a month

10:58.624 --> 11:02.394
before my 16th birthday, so--

11:02.428 --> 11:04.763
Ten years ago,
actually March 8th, 2011,

11:04.797 --> 11:08.667
I was coming home from church
with my older sister.

11:08.701 --> 11:11.503
<i>And we were at a stoplight.</i>

11:11.537 --> 11:14.606
And we were rear-ended

11:14.640 --> 11:17.308
<i>by someone who was under
the influence.</i>

11:17.343 --> 11:19.644
The impact sent Shaela

11:19.679 --> 11:21.946
through the back window.

11:21.981 --> 11:24.916
[Shaela]<i> All I can remember</i>
<i>is being in the hospital</i>

11:24.950 --> 11:28.820
<i>and feeling as if I had
a blindfold over me.</i>

11:28.854 --> 11:31.222
<i>And I tried so much
to take it off.</i>

11:31.257 --> 11:33.725
But I realized I can't,

11:33.759 --> 11:36.928
I can't take the blindfold off.

11:36.962 --> 11:38.730
<i>It's so surreal after 10 years</i>

11:38.764 --> 11:40.532
that I just have
to remind myself

11:40.566 --> 11:42.834
and accept myself
this is what happened.

11:42.868 --> 11:46.504
[Lisa] There you are smiling,
not wallowing in anything,

11:46.539 --> 11:48.617
grateful that you're here,

11:48.641 --> 11:50.742
- beautiful, getting married.
- [Shaela] It's not worth it.

11:50.776 --> 11:52.544
[Lisa] And-- right,
it's not worth it.

11:52.578 --> 11:54.679
Not worth it.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.649
Being here at Kleinfeld is--

11:57.683 --> 12:00.518
I can't fathom it.
It seems so surreal,

12:00.553 --> 12:01.753
just like my blindness
is surreal

12:01.787 --> 12:03.455
being that I, you know,
I grew up

12:03.489 --> 12:07.258
not ever thinking about
what a wedding is like,

12:07.293 --> 12:10.462
you know, being the bride.

12:10.496 --> 12:12.597
[Lisa] So, come on in.

12:12.631 --> 12:14.466
Somebody wants to say
hello to you.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.201
Okay.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.902
<i>Hello, beautiful.</i>

12:17.937 --> 12:20.338
- Randy?
<i>- Yes. Hello, Shaela.</i>

12:20.372 --> 12:21.973
I was gonna say, where's the TV?

12:22.007 --> 12:26.344
I heard your voice and I
usually only hear you on TV.

12:26.378 --> 12:28.747
Oh, my gosh, this is so weird.

12:28.781 --> 12:32.784
I've been watching you since
I was a baby and I'm 26.

12:32.818 --> 12:35.687
Okay. Well, thanks for
making me feel old, Shaela.

12:35.721 --> 12:37.288
[Lisa] Have a seat
right behind you.

12:37.323 --> 12:38.490
Okay.

12:38.524 --> 12:40.291
You're completely blind, right?

12:40.326 --> 12:41.526
Completely blind.

12:41.560 --> 12:45.263
<i>So, how do you intend
on shopping</i>

12:45.297 --> 12:46.865
<i>for your wedding dress?</i>

12:46.899 --> 12:49.534
I mean, I'm going a lot about,
like, by the feel.

12:49.568 --> 12:52.270
Not only, like, tactilely
feeling with my fingers

12:52.304 --> 12:53.571
and how the body feels

12:53.606 --> 12:55.673
and every detail
about the dress,

12:55.708 --> 12:58.710
but also, most importantly,
how it feels on me.

12:58.744 --> 13:00.378
What are you looking for,
exactly, in a dress?

13:00.412 --> 13:02.781
I definitely want a sweetheart.

13:02.815 --> 13:04.482
I was telling Lisa, I don't
know if it's bad to say

13:04.517 --> 13:07.385
I want a little showy, showy,
a little cleavage.

13:07.419 --> 13:09.287
<i>But other than that,
what I'm trying to imagine</i>

13:09.321 --> 13:11.322
me in my-- At my wedding,

13:11.357 --> 13:15.527
um, I want there to be lights
that can reflect--

13:15.561 --> 13:17.495
My dress can reflect off of,
if that makes sense.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.130
<i>So you want some sparkle
in the dress?</i>

13:19.165 --> 13:21.232
[Shaela] A little bit, yeah,
like, maybe in the tulle.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.535
Maybe Betsy might be--

13:23.569 --> 13:26.437
It's brand new, um,
you guys have it.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.373
And it's just, kind of, tip
of the shoulder,

13:28.407 --> 13:30.575
V-neck, A-line,

13:30.609 --> 13:32.644
and I think it's in the...
in the back.

13:32.678 --> 13:34.479
Okay. I'll get it. Betsy,

13:34.513 --> 13:35.980
that's one of Randy's
other dresses.

13:36.015 --> 13:38.583
Nice. I would love to wear
one of your dresses.

13:38.617 --> 13:40.552
[Lisa] Randy, also we're
gonna keep to the budget

13:40.586 --> 13:42.720
of maximum $3,000.

13:42.755 --> 13:45.790
I-- I'm so excited because,
between the two of us,

13:45.825 --> 13:49.460
we are gonna find her
the best, best dress.

13:49.495 --> 13:50.662
Okay, guys, let me sign off.

13:50.696 --> 13:53.331
- [Shaela] Okay. Bye.
- Okay. Bye, Randy.

13:53.365 --> 13:54.566
- Bye.
- Okay.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.735
I'm gonna give Lisa
and Shaela some privacy.

13:57.770 --> 14:00.171
Come on, Chewie.
Wanna go for a walk?

14:00.206 --> 14:01.506
Oh, I know.

14:01.540 --> 14:03.308
<i>Grumpy-grump. Come on, let's go.</i>

14:05.744 --> 14:07.745
- [Lisa]<i> The first dress...</i>
- [Shaela]<i> Oh.</i>

14:07.780 --> 14:10.448
[Lisa]<i> ...is a beautiful</i>
<i>Martina Liana.</i>

14:10.482 --> 14:11.749
- [Shaela] Ooh, I like this.
- It has a...

14:11.784 --> 14:13.651
- I like the thin straps.
- [Lisa] Right.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.420
- It has spaghetti strap.
- [Shaela] Yes. Okay.

14:15.454 --> 14:17.322
Well, you feel it first
and tell me.

14:17.356 --> 14:18.489
[Shaela] I like it.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.925
It goes from this texture
to that texture,

14:20.960 --> 14:22.527
- and then back.
- [Lisa] That's right.

14:22.561 --> 14:24.629
[Shaela] Yes.
And then, the lace.

14:24.663 --> 14:25.697
Oh, my gosh. I can't wait.

14:25.731 --> 14:28.344
- Yeah.
- I can't wait to try it on.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.667
- Mom's making a face.
- Mom?

14:29.702 --> 14:32.637
I have a little bit
of a reservation right here.

14:32.671 --> 14:33.771
- [Shaela] Of what?
- [Lisa] About this?

14:33.806 --> 14:35.473
- We'll deal with your mother.
- Okay.

14:35.507 --> 14:38.042
I was, like, I have something
to say to that.

14:39.378 --> 14:40.478
[Stacey] This don't say
funky good time?

14:40.512 --> 14:41.613
Uh-uh.

14:41.647 --> 14:42.680
[Candace] What-what does it say?

14:42.715 --> 14:44.382
That she's the bridesmaid.

14:44.416 --> 14:46.351
[Candace] Okay.

14:49.421 --> 14:51.256
[upbeat music playing]

14:51.290 --> 14:55.460
[indistinct chatter]

14:55.494 --> 14:56.694
[Lisa]
Before you take your robe off,

14:56.729 --> 14:58.396
I want you to just move here
for a minute.

14:58.430 --> 14:59.530
- Oh, feel the pedestal?
- Yeah, keep going,

14:59.565 --> 15:00.632
- it's a circle.
- Can I hold your hands?

15:00.666 --> 15:02.500
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

15:02.534 --> 15:04.335
[Lisa]<i> I have never worked</i>
<i>with a blind bride,</i>

15:04.370 --> 15:06.537
this is really gonna be
interesting to me

15:06.572 --> 15:08.740
but, you know what,
she seems to, like,

15:08.774 --> 15:11.476
<i>know what she wants
and she seems to also know</i>

15:11.510 --> 15:14.245
how things feel,
like, she-she called it

15:14.280 --> 15:16.514
when she touched it, she knew
exactly what the dress was.

15:16.548 --> 15:18.416
Oh, my goodness,
do you look great.

15:18.450 --> 15:19.817
Oh.

15:19.852 --> 15:21.452
[Lisa] So it must have been
hard for you

15:21.487 --> 15:22.520
in the beginning, huh?

15:22.554 --> 15:23.721
I thought everything
was gonna go back

15:23.756 --> 15:25.523
to the way it was
before my accident.

15:25.557 --> 15:26.691
I thought everything
was gonna be the same.

15:26.725 --> 15:28.493
I was gonna have all my friends.

15:28.527 --> 15:30.595
I can't even tell you
the number of friends I lost

15:30.629 --> 15:32.630
due to that communication
barrier.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.832
When I became blind,

15:34.867 --> 15:36.901
I had this pessimistic feeling
inside of me

15:36.936 --> 15:40.471
that I wasn't ever
gonna be able to find someone

15:40.506 --> 15:42.484
<i>because, I mean,
who wants to be with someone</i>

15:42.508 --> 15:43.608
<i>who can't see?</i>

15:43.642 --> 15:46.744
But then I met Tyler.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.781
<i>We were in our class
and we just started talking</i>

15:49.815 --> 15:52.684
and at the very end,
you know, he did the cliche,

15:52.718 --> 15:54.786
you know, can I have
your number for a reason

15:54.820 --> 15:57.255
other than why he actually
wanted my number.

15:59.758 --> 16:02.994
- Will you marry me?
- Hold on.

16:06.665 --> 16:08.866
<i>He cares so much
about my happiness.</i>

16:08.901 --> 16:12.136
<i>When I don't feel beautiful,
he makes me feel beautiful.</i>

16:14.807 --> 16:16.474
So are you ready to show
that? Feel...

16:16.508 --> 16:17.842
...I want you to feel
everything.

16:17.876 --> 16:20.445
- Okay. So, feel the neckline.
- I already feel it, though.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.714
It's simple but not simple,
you know what I mean?

16:22.748 --> 16:24.549
But it's simple in the best
way possible.

16:24.583 --> 16:25.516
- Right.
- Does that make sense?

16:25.551 --> 16:26.517
- Yes.
- And-and then,

16:26.552 --> 16:28.519
the different textures.

16:28.554 --> 16:31.990
Okay. Let's get logged back on.

16:32.024 --> 16:34.225
- Let's go, shall we?
- Okay. Let's go.

16:34.259 --> 16:36.227
Hey, guys.

16:36.261 --> 16:37.428
[Randy]<i> Don't forget me.</i>

16:37.463 --> 16:39.364
[Lisa] Oh, gosh, Randy,
I'm sorry.

16:39.398 --> 16:42.033
- [Randy]<i> Yes.</i>
- I almost forgot you.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.438
Oh, okay. Oh, my God.

16:47.473 --> 16:48.706
[Lisa] Okay. So, just follow me,

16:48.741 --> 16:50.375
- a little to the left.
- Oh, wow.

16:52.978 --> 16:55.546
- [Kellie] Shaela, oh, my God.
- We're gonna go straight.

16:55.581 --> 16:57.382
We're gonna be getting on
this pedestal thing

16:57.416 --> 16:58.483
but it's not in front of you.

16:58.517 --> 16:59.517
I have you far away from it.

16:59.551 --> 17:02.420
I love that [indistinct]

17:02.454 --> 17:03.621
[Kellie speaking]

17:03.655 --> 17:05.656
[Lisa] And I'm gonna
turn you around.

17:05.691 --> 17:08.092
Randy, where are you?
Here you are, right?

17:08.127 --> 17:08.726
I'm here.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.395
Introduce yourself to Randy.

17:10.429 --> 17:11.496
Hi. I'm Kellie.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.564
[Lisa] And this is mom.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.266
- I'm so excited.
- [Randy]<i> Hi, mom.</i>

17:15.300 --> 17:16.501
[Lisa W.] Hi, Randy.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.603
I'm going to give
Kellie the iPad.

17:18.637 --> 17:21.439
- [Kellie] Yes.
- To hold and--

17:21.473 --> 17:22.640
Oh.

17:22.674 --> 17:25.309
- So, can you see?
- Did that work?

17:25.344 --> 17:26.711
Wow.

17:26.745 --> 17:28.946
[Kellie] Oh, my goodness,
it's literally-- It,

17:28.981 --> 17:31.482
it's perfect.
I love this dress so much.

17:31.517 --> 17:33.418
[Randy]<i> It's stunning.</i>

17:33.452 --> 17:35.453
<i>How-how do you feel, Shaela?</i>

17:35.487 --> 17:36.554
- [Kellie] You--
- I feel good.

17:36.588 --> 17:37.655
[Kellie] Girl, you look so good.

17:37.689 --> 17:39.657
- I feel good.
- You look so good.

17:39.691 --> 17:41.893
- Mom's making a face.
- Mom?

17:41.927 --> 17:43.795
I have a little bit
of a reservation right here.

17:43.829 --> 17:45.797
- [Shaela] Of what?
- [Lisa] About this?

17:45.831 --> 17:46.864
- We'll deal with your mother.
- Okay.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.733
I was, like, I have something
to say to that.

17:48.767 --> 17:50.368
I have something to say
about that but--

17:50.402 --> 17:51.469
- I know, but--
- Right now,

17:51.503 --> 17:54.272
it's not a perfect fit,
right, Randy?

17:54.306 --> 17:56.307
- Yeah.
- And, if necessary,

17:56.341 --> 17:58.443
we could get
some extra lace applique

17:58.477 --> 17:59.677
and fill in a little bit.

17:59.711 --> 18:01.446
- Just a little bit.
- Just a little

18:01.480 --> 18:03.214
but we want her to be sexy.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.449
Bodice is sheer over here.

18:04.483 --> 18:07.485
And part of that
is really very important,

18:07.519 --> 18:09.821
because you see how it creates
an optical illusion,

18:09.855 --> 18:11.522
- makes the waist look smaller.
- [Kellie] Oh, yeah.

18:11.557 --> 18:13.491
I think we started out
with a good first.

18:13.525 --> 18:14.625
[Kellie] Yeah, I know.

18:14.660 --> 18:16.761
I think it's a little much.

18:16.795 --> 18:18.696
I don't know if I'm gonna be
able to get a dress

18:18.730 --> 18:20.598
<i>where my mom is not gonna--</i>

18:20.632 --> 18:22.366
<i>She's not gonna,
you know, like it</i>

18:22.401 --> 18:23.701
or approve of it.

18:23.735 --> 18:25.503
We'll see you
in a few minutes, okay, guys?

18:25.537 --> 18:27.438
- Bye.
- [Lisa] Make a right turn.

18:27.473 --> 18:29.307
So, I'm a little bit worried
about that.

18:32.911 --> 18:37.448
- [upbeat music playing]
- [indistinct chatter]

18:37.483 --> 18:38.616
Hi, babe.

18:38.650 --> 18:40.418
[Dalen speaking]

18:40.452 --> 18:43.154
[Stacey]<i> Dalen hunts ghosts</i>
<i>for a living</i>

18:43.188 --> 18:44.589
<i>all over the world.</i>

18:44.623 --> 18:46.991
What is it? [bleep]

18:47.025 --> 18:50.461
<i>And when I found out
what he did, I just said,</i>

18:50.496 --> 18:54.732
"Leave the ghosts out
where you hunt them. Yeah."

18:55.901 --> 18:58.936
Hope I'll find something good
that's gonna make you cry.

18:58.971 --> 19:03.574
Dalen and I meet initially
when we were in college.

19:03.609 --> 19:05.643
<i>And then years passed by</i>

19:05.677 --> 19:09.547
<i>and we ran into each other
and I saw him again</i>

19:09.581 --> 19:12.183
<i>and he was older,
and more mature,</i>

19:12.217 --> 19:15.820
<i>and I was gonna hook him up
with someone that I knew.</i>

19:15.854 --> 19:17.555
And he responded back and said,

19:17.589 --> 19:19.724
"Stacey, if you're not
hooking me up with you,

19:19.758 --> 19:20.791
then, no, thank you."

19:21.760 --> 19:24.395
If you don't cry, Dalen,
it's gonna be a problem.

19:24.429 --> 19:25.496
If a tear don't drop, that means

19:25.531 --> 19:27.165
we didn't do a good job.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.101
Aha!

19:31.136 --> 19:35.506
This... is... it.

19:35.541 --> 19:38.176
I already have
my ceremony dress.

19:38.210 --> 19:39.210
It's lace,

19:39.244 --> 19:40.578
<i>it's fitted,</i>

19:40.612 --> 19:42.513
<i>it has tulle,</i>

19:42.548 --> 19:43.748
<i>it is gorgeous.</i>

19:43.782 --> 19:46.551
And now I'm here
to get my reception dress

19:46.585 --> 19:48.753
<i>which has to be just as stunning</i>

19:48.787 --> 19:52.290
<i>and just as sexy and gorgeous.</i>

19:52.324 --> 19:54.592
Whoo, I feel good.

19:54.626 --> 19:58.362
<i>The Eve of Milady dress
I'm in is a showstopper,</i>

19:58.397 --> 20:00.364
<i>but my ceremony dress</i>

20:00.399 --> 20:02.567
is also an Eve of Milady.

20:02.601 --> 20:05.303
Okay. Yeah.

20:05.337 --> 20:07.171
Yeah. All right.

20:09.508 --> 20:11.309
Dress number two.

20:11.343 --> 20:12.810
[Aikisha] I love it.

20:12.844 --> 20:15.012
[Stacey] I do, I like this one.

20:15.781 --> 20:18.416
- Oh, all the details.
- Mmm-hmm.

20:19.585 --> 20:21.118
[Candace]
Well, what do we think?

20:21.153 --> 20:22.386
I like this.

20:22.421 --> 20:24.322
I like the sleeves,
I love cleave.

20:24.356 --> 20:25.690
I like... I like this one.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.625
- [Stacey] I love the detail.
- I like this one.

20:27.659 --> 20:29.360
[Stacey]
I love the back, actually.

20:29.394 --> 20:30.595
It's giving me life.

20:30.629 --> 20:32.563
[Shameika] That is beautiful.

20:32.598 --> 20:34.365
I like that one
way better than the first one.

20:34.399 --> 20:36.567
Yeah. The first one? No.

20:36.602 --> 20:39.604
Now the first one is a,
a definite no?

20:39.638 --> 20:41.639
[Candace] No, I said it was no.

20:41.673 --> 20:43.341
She didn't like
the first one anyway.

20:44.810 --> 20:47.245
But she didn't tell me that
when I came out here

20:47.279 --> 20:48.613
- the first time.
- I did, too.

20:48.647 --> 20:50.581
No, you didn't.
You did not say you--

20:50.616 --> 20:52.550
"I don't like it."
You said, "I like it."

20:52.584 --> 20:54.619
I said--
You said you don't love it.

20:54.653 --> 20:57.321
- I said I like it.
- [Stacey] You never said

20:57.356 --> 20:58.723
I don't like it, Stacey.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.491
[Aikisha] Oh, well,
I'm gonna say it now.

21:00.525 --> 21:01.926
That didn't come out your mouth.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.594
Yeah, I'm telling you now,
I didn't like it.

21:03.629 --> 21:05.496
- [Stacey] No, okay.
- But I like this one.

21:05.530 --> 21:07.331
I mean, I'm just saying,
you should have been honest

21:07.366 --> 21:09.433
when I first came out.

21:09.468 --> 21:11.569
But, anyhoo, this one is nice.

21:11.603 --> 21:13.604
[Stacey]
Yeah, I like this one a lot.

21:13.639 --> 21:15.640
[Aikisha] For sure, mmm-hmm.

21:15.674 --> 21:17.642
But how I'mma dance in this?

21:17.676 --> 21:19.343
[Candace] We could do that
in alterations.

21:19.378 --> 21:20.645
They can just shorten it.

21:20.679 --> 21:23.281
[Shameika] Yeah, mmm-hmm.

21:23.315 --> 21:24.482
- Okay.
- [Aikisha] So,

21:24.516 --> 21:25.650
what do you think
about that one?

21:25.684 --> 21:27.785
Hmm? I think it's okay.

21:27.819 --> 21:29.654
- [Shameika] Oh.
- I think it's pretty.

21:29.688 --> 21:31.689
- But I am not...
- [Shameika] Oh, okay.

21:31.723 --> 21:33.624
[Stacey] ...you know,
excited about it.

21:33.659 --> 21:36.527
- Oh, well, I love it.
- [Aikisha] Mmm-hmm, I do too.

21:36.561 --> 21:39.130
So, my girls love this dress

21:39.164 --> 21:42.433
because it reminds them
of the ceremony dress.

21:42.467 --> 21:44.402
<i>Like, I can't,
you know, look like</i>

21:44.436 --> 21:47.471
I'm coming to the reception
in the same dress.

21:47.506 --> 21:49.640
I just feel like
it's a lot of dress...

21:49.675 --> 21:51.776
- [Candace] Okay.
- ...kind of, for the reception.

21:51.810 --> 21:54.345
[Stacey] We need to find me
the reception dress.

21:54.379 --> 21:55.513
- Okay.
- Yes.

21:55.547 --> 21:56.647
We're gonna keep going.

21:56.682 --> 21:58.349
It's beautiful, though.

21:58.383 --> 21:59.383
All right, ladies,
we'll be back.

21:59.418 --> 22:00.584
Okay.

22:00.619 --> 22:02.453
So, does she like,
uh, the dress?

22:02.487 --> 22:05.389
I don't know but it doesn't
matter. Like--

22:08.694 --> 22:11.395
But that one was a lot prettier.

22:13.498 --> 22:16.300
[Candace] Dorothy, knock, knock.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.501
What's going on?

22:17.536 --> 22:19.670
So, we are running out
of options

22:19.705 --> 22:21.305
with the stock piece.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.773
I'm getting desperate, Dorothy.

22:22.808 --> 22:24.775
Is there any designers that
you think will do a rush...

22:24.810 --> 22:26.711
- No, no. No.
- [Candace] ...in six weeks?

22:26.745 --> 22:28.646
- It's gotta be only in stock.
- Okay.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.381
[Dorothy] In-stock dresses only.

22:30.415 --> 22:31.349
All right.

22:31.383 --> 22:32.416
We're running thin.

22:32.451 --> 22:33.718
The stock is low

22:33.752 --> 22:35.386
<i>and I really wanna make
Stacey happy,</i>

22:35.420 --> 22:38.155
so I'm really getting nervous.

22:42.527 --> 22:45.996
[upbeat music playing]

22:47.399 --> 22:49.300
- [Shaela]<i> Where are you from?</i>
- New York.

22:49.334 --> 22:50.668
- You're from New York?
- Yeah.

22:50.702 --> 22:52.370
- I love the accent.
- The New York accent?

22:52.404 --> 22:54.505
- You have the New York accent.
- [laughs]

22:54.539 --> 22:55.906
- You know that?
- New York.

22:55.941 --> 22:58.542
With me being blind,
I pay so much attention to it.

22:58.577 --> 23:00.411
- Yes.
- But, like, I was thinking,

23:00.445 --> 23:01.545
is it New Jersey?
Is it New York?

23:01.580 --> 23:03.547
- What is it?
- Not New Jersey.

23:03.582 --> 23:04.882
Do you think she'll do
an A-line?

23:04.916 --> 23:07.151
I think they might have one
back there for her.

23:07.185 --> 23:08.319
Yeah.

23:08.353 --> 23:09.653
[Lisa] All right.

23:09.688 --> 23:11.922
So, we're gonna put
Randy's dress on now.

23:11.957 --> 23:13.457
Let me get you zipped.
This is quite big on you.

23:13.492 --> 23:14.725
[Shaela] Yeah.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.761
- [Lisa] Move a little forward.
- Okay.

23:16.795 --> 23:18.596
[Lisa] Okay. So I wanna just
let it lay out, so...

23:18.630 --> 23:20.331
[Shaela] I have different
emotions about this.

23:20.365 --> 23:21.599
So, tell me about the emotions

23:21.633 --> 23:23.234
because that's key.
I need to know.

23:23.268 --> 23:24.402
You don't seem as excited.

23:24.436 --> 23:25.636
[Shaela] I like it.

23:25.670 --> 23:27.505
I love that I could feel
rhinestones.

23:27.539 --> 23:29.206
- Yeah, the sequins...
- [Shaela] The sequins,

23:29.241 --> 23:30.641
...the sequins under this.

23:30.675 --> 23:33.344
And it has a different,
like, fabric and textures.

23:33.378 --> 23:35.312
Yup.

23:35.347 --> 23:37.648
I'm not really feeling
this dress,

23:37.682 --> 23:39.550
<i>something just feels off</i>

23:39.584 --> 23:41.719
<i>and I'm not sure quite
what it is.</i>

23:41.753 --> 23:44.422
- [Lisa] We're coming.
- Yay.

23:44.456 --> 23:46.557
Ooh, okay.

23:46.591 --> 23:48.559
And we are approaching the gang.

23:48.593 --> 23:50.394
- [Kellie] Hey.
- Oh, my gosh.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.763
[Lisa] And we're gonna get you
on the pedestal.

23:52.798 --> 23:55.232
Drop down the dress
and let's turn.

23:58.737 --> 24:02.606
This is an A-line dress
and this is by Randy.

24:02.641 --> 24:04.241
- I love this.
- [Shaela] Randy.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.709
- I think the skirt is...
- Sparkle.

24:05.744 --> 24:07.511
[Kellie]
...easily my favorite part.

24:07.546 --> 24:09.313
[Randy] Lisa, can I show you
what the front's

24:09.347 --> 24:10.414
supposed to look like?

24:10.449 --> 24:11.682
Okay, let me see.

24:11.716 --> 24:14.852
- [Kellie] No, Shaela.
- No. Oh, my gosh.

24:14.886 --> 24:17.321
- [Lisa] Oh, my gosh. Okay.
- [Kellie] Oh, Shaela.

24:17.355 --> 24:18.522
That changed everything for--

24:18.557 --> 24:19.690
It just changed everything.

24:19.724 --> 24:21.525
[Randy] Yeah, supposed to hit...

24:21.560 --> 24:23.227
- In a good way?
- ...at the widest point

24:23.261 --> 24:25.262
of the shoulder, so it makes

24:25.297 --> 24:26.497
your waist look smaller.

24:26.531 --> 24:28.399
- [Lisa] Yes.
- I think this is beautiful.

24:28.433 --> 24:29.567
You're absolutely right,
Randy, thank you

24:29.601 --> 24:31.402
for telling me that.

24:31.436 --> 24:33.637
[Kellie] I think it's more
flattering on her.

24:33.672 --> 24:35.406
This one is very, very romantic.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.775
But where's the sexy?

24:37.809 --> 24:39.176
Because I don't really feel it.

24:39.211 --> 24:40.511
Although I may not feel,

24:40.545 --> 24:42.446
you know, that great in it,

24:42.481 --> 24:43.747
<i>I could definitely sense</i>

24:43.782 --> 24:46.183
<i>in the inflections
of their voice</i>

24:46.218 --> 24:50.287
<i>and how excited they are
about this dress,</i>

24:50.322 --> 24:51.589
which means a lot to me

24:51.623 --> 24:54.291
because, of course, their
opinion matters.

24:54.326 --> 24:57.361
[Lisa] This is at the tip
of the shoulder, tip.

25:01.766 --> 25:04.802
Even though Shaela can't see
herself in this dress,

25:04.836 --> 25:08.172
<i>the number one thing that I tell</i>

25:08.206 --> 25:09.640
<i>every single bride</i>

25:09.674 --> 25:12.376
is that you have
to feel beautiful

25:12.410 --> 25:13.677
in your dress.

25:13.712 --> 25:15.579
I think I wanna
still try on the other one

25:15.614 --> 25:16.780
- just 'cause.
- Just because?

25:16.815 --> 25:19.750
Just to get
that final confirmation.

25:19.784 --> 25:23.020
I wanna try on
the third dress that we have

25:23.054 --> 25:26.390
<i>because there's just
something inside of me</i>

25:26.424 --> 25:28.692
<i>that feels like I need to.</i>

25:28.727 --> 25:31.295
I don't know if you ever get
that feeling inside of you

25:31.329 --> 25:32.730
that's, like, just do it,
just do it, just do it.

25:32.764 --> 25:35.332
Why don't we slip
the other one on quickly.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.767
- See how you feel.
- Yup. See how I feel.

25:36.801 --> 25:39.537
[Lisa] If you feel like it's
a competitor, we'll show it.

25:39.571 --> 25:41.272
- Okay.
- This is beautiful on you,

25:41.306 --> 25:42.540
- Shaela, I have to say.
- Really?

25:42.574 --> 25:44.542
- It truly is.
- Thank you, Randy.

25:44.576 --> 25:46.443
- Okay. We'll see you soon.
- [Kellie] All righty.

25:46.478 --> 25:47.545
- Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

25:47.579 --> 25:49.413
[Shaela] Bye.

25:49.447 --> 25:52.583
[upbeat music playing]

25:52.617 --> 25:55.619
You look beautiful.

25:55.654 --> 25:57.555
<i>We have been trying on dresses,</i>

25:57.589 --> 26:00.558
haven't found anything yet.
Everything--

26:00.592 --> 26:03.694
I mean, I'm six weeks
away from my wedding,

26:03.728 --> 26:04.895
<i>so we don't have much time,</i>

26:04.930 --> 26:07.598
<i>so they have to pull
the items that they have</i>

26:07.632 --> 26:09.300
available on the floor.

26:09.334 --> 26:10.467
[Candace] Stacey.

26:10.502 --> 26:11.969
[Stacey] It's down to the wire.

26:12.003 --> 26:13.571
I have a lot faith
in this dress.

26:13.605 --> 26:16.407
Uh, it has the sparkle,
it'll have the fit.

26:16.441 --> 26:18.576
Let's just see if the two
can come together

26:18.610 --> 26:20.244
and make the magic that we need.

26:20.278 --> 26:21.478
- [Stacey] All right.
- Ready?

26:21.513 --> 26:22.713
[Stacey] Let's do it. I'm ready.

26:22.747 --> 26:25.583
I feel bad. I really want her to

26:25.617 --> 26:28.619
<i>have the two dream dresses
that she wants</i>

26:28.653 --> 26:31.555
<i>but, just, I don't have
the options to do it.</i>

26:31.590 --> 26:33.457
<i>I have to work with what I have</i>

26:33.491 --> 26:36.360
and I'm caught between
a rock and a hard place.

26:36.394 --> 26:39.496
Mmm-hmm. That's pretty.

26:39.531 --> 26:42.466
- Yeah. Has potential.
- It does.

26:42.500 --> 26:46.303
[tense music playing]

26:46.338 --> 26:47.371
[Candace] Okay, ladies.

26:55.213 --> 26:56.513
- Um--
- That is--

26:56.548 --> 26:58.649
- [Stacey] I like the fit.
- I love the fit.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.418
[Stacey] And it has that
corset that's just gonna

27:01.453 --> 27:04.221
- snatch that waist in.
- [Shameika] Mmm-hmm.

27:07.425 --> 27:10.227
What do we think, ladies?

27:11.529 --> 27:12.830
[Stacey] It's pretty.

27:12.864 --> 27:15.532
I do like it.
They're not feeling it.

27:15.567 --> 27:17.768
[Stacey] I could tell
from the faces.

27:17.802 --> 27:19.603
[Shameika] It's not
popping out like you've got

27:19.638 --> 27:22.339
to have a funky
good time, like you said.

27:22.374 --> 27:24.041
[Stacey] This don't say
funky good time?

27:24.075 --> 27:24.608
Uh-uh.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.210
[Lisa] What does it say?

27:26.244 --> 27:28.245
That she's the bridesmaid.

27:29.547 --> 27:31.281
How do you feel?

27:35.320 --> 27:38.188
I love it. I do.

27:38.223 --> 27:39.590
You love it? You know,
you got to be careful...

27:39.624 --> 27:40.824
- I like it.
- ...how you use that word.

27:40.859 --> 27:42.626
- I like it.
- [Candace] Okay. All right.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.294
Don't get me too excited,
like, "We love it."

27:44.329 --> 27:45.429
I don't have that--

27:45.463 --> 27:47.364
- Wow?
- You don't have wow?

27:47.399 --> 27:48.799
But I don't know,
maybe I won't have that

27:48.833 --> 27:51.502
because it's
the reception dress and--

27:51.536 --> 27:52.703
[Aikisha] No, you will.

27:52.737 --> 27:54.471
[Candace] And at the end
of that day,

27:54.506 --> 27:55.673
- we want you to love...
- Yeah, I wanna--

27:55.707 --> 27:57.307
- Yes.
- [Candace] ...your dress.

27:57.342 --> 27:58.442
[Candace] Both dresses.

27:58.476 --> 28:00.110
I feel defeated.

28:00.145 --> 28:01.311
I feel like

28:01.346 --> 28:03.614
<i>I just can't believe</i>

28:03.648 --> 28:06.517
<i>that I might be
leaving Kleinfeld</i>

28:06.551 --> 28:08.552
<i>without my reception dress.</i>

28:08.586 --> 28:10.721
<i>I just can't believe it.</i>

28:10.755 --> 28:13.490
I guess six weeks
really is close.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.292
So, is this the last one?

28:15.326 --> 28:16.593
[Candace] This is the last one.

28:16.628 --> 28:18.796
- [Stacey] This is the final.
- I just--. Okay.

28:18.830 --> 28:22.032
Yup. I just have one more.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.536
[Candace]
You just have one more?

28:25.570 --> 28:27.371
- Was it out here?
- Yeah.

28:27.405 --> 28:29.373
Everything else
that we have out here,

28:29.407 --> 28:31.241
we just can't get in time.

28:31.276 --> 28:32.376
Unless she fits what--

28:32.410 --> 28:34.812
Unless she can fit it today.

28:34.846 --> 28:36.480
[Aikisha]
Can we try that one on?

28:36.514 --> 28:38.415
- This one on a mannequin?
- [Aikisha] Yup.

28:40.351 --> 28:41.585
- This right here.
- Oh.

28:41.619 --> 28:44.621
She likes a sweetheart,
it's open.

28:44.656 --> 28:46.290
What do you think of this one?

28:46.324 --> 28:47.391
That is beautiful.

28:47.425 --> 28:48.759
That is really pretty.

28:48.793 --> 28:51.695
And it's all-- It's what
we liked at the bottom,

28:51.730 --> 28:52.496
what she liked on the last dress

28:52.530 --> 28:54.264
and what we like up here.

28:54.299 --> 28:55.733
[Candace] Oh, boy.

28:55.767 --> 28:57.501
- Let me see.
- [Aikisha] Okay.

28:57.535 --> 28:59.803
I would never want you
to try you on something

28:59.838 --> 29:01.505
and then tell you,
you can't get it.

29:01.539 --> 29:03.774
- Okay.
- So, before I even

29:03.808 --> 29:06.276
take it off the mannequin,
and we take that step of you

29:06.311 --> 29:07.978
getting in the dress.

29:08.012 --> 29:09.580
I need Dorothy
to tell me yes or no.

29:09.614 --> 29:11.281
Well, let's get Ms. Dorothy
up in here.

29:11.316 --> 29:12.483
[Candace] Okay. Yes.

29:12.517 --> 29:14.351
We've been saying that

29:14.385 --> 29:16.520
- we will find a dress today.
- Yes.

29:16.554 --> 29:18.355
Lord, this is the dress.

29:18.389 --> 29:19.590
We know it's the dress.

29:19.624 --> 29:21.592
Let us walk out here
with it today.

29:21.626 --> 29:24.461
- Yes.
- Yes. Amen.

29:24.496 --> 29:26.730
The dress
is absolutely beautiful.

29:26.765 --> 29:30.200
The dress is gorgeous
even on the mannequin,

29:30.235 --> 29:31.368
and I'm, like, wow.

29:31.402 --> 29:33.604
[Candace] Oh, Dorothy.

29:33.638 --> 29:35.672
This could be, this could be it.

29:35.707 --> 29:39.176
[Candace] My bride, they saw
a dress on the mannequin.

29:39.210 --> 29:40.344
Pantora.

29:44.716 --> 29:46.383
What do you think?

29:46.417 --> 29:48.752
I like it.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.187
That was hesitant.

29:54.826 --> 29:57.427
- [upbeat music playing]
- [indistinct chatter]

30:04.502 --> 30:06.837
- Okay. Come on in.
- Come on in.

30:06.871 --> 30:08.672
Well, we threw you a curveball.

30:08.706 --> 30:10.841
- We did. Oh, my gosh.
- Okay.

30:10.875 --> 30:13.644
- One step. Then up.
- Okay.

30:13.678 --> 30:15.312
[Shaela] They-- It's--

30:15.346 --> 30:17.481
They seem so sure
about this dress.

30:17.515 --> 30:19.349
I'm gonna put the last one
on now.

30:19.384 --> 30:21.351
[Shaela] Can I feel that dress
before I put it on?

30:21.386 --> 30:22.653
[Lisa] Oh, sure.
Let me bring it to you.

30:22.687 --> 30:24.454
[Shaela] Okay.

30:24.489 --> 30:27.691
But, yet, when I touched
the third dress,

30:27.725 --> 30:31.662
it's just-- It's so detailed
and I love that about it.

30:31.696 --> 30:33.764
I think Shaela is about
to come out right now

30:33.798 --> 30:35.699
<i>- with her next dress.</i>
- Okay.

30:35.733 --> 30:39.002
Let me see if I can
hold you up like this.

30:41.372 --> 30:43.340
- I'm nervous.
- Oh.

30:43.374 --> 30:44.942
Ooh.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.144
Okay.

30:47.946 --> 30:49.313
They're looking.
They're taking it in.

30:49.347 --> 30:51.148
- They're smiling.
- Wow.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.421
[Shaela] What do you think?

31:00.191 --> 31:02.192
I like it.

31:02.227 --> 31:03.393
That was hesitant.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.300
Do you love it?

31:13.137 --> 31:14.238
It's everything.

31:17.809 --> 31:20.477
[Kellie]<i> What are your</i>
<i>favorite parts about it?</i>

31:20.511 --> 31:21.678
It has the different fabrics.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.547
- Mmm-hmm.
- [Shaela] Like, the textures.

31:23.581 --> 31:25.649
And it has the sparkle
a little bit, right?

31:25.683 --> 31:27.751
[Lisa] It has a little bit
of sparkle, more up here,

31:27.785 --> 31:29.720
and then tapered off,
but in here too.

31:29.754 --> 31:32.122
I just love how it feels
in this area.

31:32.156 --> 31:33.290
[Lisa] Okay.

31:34.392 --> 31:35.592
It's everything.

31:35.627 --> 31:37.227
[Lisa W.] I think
you like the fitted.

31:37.262 --> 31:39.329
It's everything.

31:39.364 --> 31:41.465
It's interesting, because

31:41.499 --> 31:43.667
I've had such a hard time
describing

31:43.701 --> 31:45.535
what type of dress I want.

31:45.570 --> 31:49.506
<i>But, yet, when I have
this dress on me,</i>

31:49.540 --> 31:53.277
I feel that exact feeling
that I can't describe.

31:53.311 --> 31:54.544
<i>I think--</i>

31:54.579 --> 31:57.514
I mean, she feels
beautiful in this dress.

31:57.548 --> 31:58.849
I can tell.

31:58.883 --> 32:01.618
Yeah. I really think Tyler
would like it, too.

32:01.653 --> 32:03.720
- Oh, definitely.
- [Shaela]<i> Yeah.</i>

32:03.755 --> 32:06.757
Because in this one,
she looks glamorous and sexy.

32:06.791 --> 32:08.759
[Shaela] Yeah.
That's just what I want.

32:08.793 --> 32:10.527
- [Lisa] But elegant.
- [Shaela] Luxurious.

32:10.561 --> 32:12.396
[Lisa W.] Yes, I love it.

32:12.430 --> 32:13.797
[Lisa]
It's total fairytale, too.

32:13.831 --> 32:16.300
[Shaela] Yeah. I really like it.

32:16.334 --> 32:18.001
Well, can I put
a veil on your head?

32:18.036 --> 32:20.604
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Are you gonna wear a veil?

32:20.638 --> 32:22.306
I am gonna wear a veil.

32:22.340 --> 32:24.241
- So I'm gonna go grab one.
- Okay.

32:24.275 --> 32:25.709
This dress is amazing.

32:25.743 --> 32:27.411
<i>It gives a little bit of sexy,</i>

32:27.445 --> 32:29.780
but same comfort
and I just think

32:29.814 --> 32:31.481
it's the most perfect dress
for her.

32:31.516 --> 32:32.783
[Lisa] You can feel it,
right, Shaela?

32:32.817 --> 32:34.584
- Yeah, I can.
- Like it's nothing up here.

32:34.619 --> 32:36.320
It just feels...

32:36.354 --> 32:38.288
It's just crazy.

32:38.323 --> 32:39.423
It's just crazy.

32:41.592 --> 32:44.761
Well, I know all little girls
dream about

32:44.796 --> 32:47.297
having their wedding
and getting married.

32:47.332 --> 32:49.199
Mmm-hmm.

32:49.233 --> 32:52.536
We almost didn't

32:52.570 --> 32:54.805
get to complete this dream.

32:54.839 --> 32:57.574
I'm just beyond
blessed and happy

32:57.608 --> 32:59.409
that we can be here with her

32:59.444 --> 33:00.911
to get this dress.

33:00.945 --> 33:03.613
You're very beautiful, honey,
and don't ever let anybody

33:03.648 --> 33:06.116
tell you anything different,
okay?

33:08.219 --> 33:09.953
I feel like a bride.

33:11.489 --> 33:13.724
[Lisa] Well, Randy,
do you think that you and I

33:13.758 --> 33:15.625
need to do something right now?

33:15.660 --> 33:17.427
[Shaela] Oh, my gosh.

33:17.462 --> 33:21.498
[Lisa] So his thumbs are up.
So, okay.

33:21.532 --> 33:26.970
[girls] Shaela, are you saying
yes to the dress?

33:30.408 --> 33:31.608
Yes.

33:31.642 --> 33:36.146
[cheers and applause]

33:39.717 --> 33:41.785
- You look lovely.
- [Randy]<i> It's beautiful.</i>

33:41.819 --> 33:44.454
<i>I'm just really happy
that she chose the dress</i>

33:44.489 --> 33:46.790
that made her feel
the most beautiful.

33:46.824 --> 33:50.394
We did it. We did it.
I found it.

33:50.428 --> 33:52.362
- I found it.
- Beautiful.

33:52.397 --> 33:54.097
- Great job, Lisa.
- Bye, Randy.

33:54.132 --> 33:55.232
[both] Mwah.

33:55.266 --> 33:57.167

34:04.409 --> 34:07.477
[tense music playing]

34:07.512 --> 34:10.447
[indistinct chatter]

34:13.251 --> 34:15.485
Oh, my gosh. Dorothy!

34:15.520 --> 34:17.254
[Dorothy] Yes, dear.

34:18.256 --> 34:19.456
[Candace] So, my bride,

34:19.490 --> 34:20.857
they saw a dress
on the mannequin.

34:20.892 --> 34:23.393
- Which dress?
- [Candace] Pantora.

34:27.598 --> 34:29.499
Can I show it to you?

34:29.534 --> 34:32.302
I really hope that we could
sell it out of stock.

34:32.336 --> 34:34.704
<i>Aikisha is, like,</i>

34:34.739 --> 34:38.141
there's this dress
that I need you to try on.

34:39.510 --> 34:41.278
Girl, hush.

34:41.312 --> 34:42.646
That girl is relentless, okay?

34:42.680 --> 34:44.881
If someone said no,
we couldn't try that dress on,

34:44.916 --> 34:48.285
she was gonna ask again,
again, and again.

34:49.387 --> 34:50.587
Here's Dorothy, ladies.

34:50.621 --> 34:52.456
- Hi.
- Hi, Ms. Dorothy.

34:52.490 --> 34:54.458
You're a big troublemaker.
I just wanna tell you.

34:54.492 --> 34:56.493
No. That would be
this one right here.

34:56.527 --> 34:58.361
- You're a big troublemaker.
- The small one is always

34:58.396 --> 34:59.596
the troublemaker.

34:59.630 --> 35:01.798
We want some good news.
I'm just--

35:01.833 --> 35:02.566
- You love this one?
- [Stacey] Yes.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.267
[Dorothy] Is this the dress?

35:10.441 --> 35:11.575
- Try it on.
- [Stacey] We can try it?

35:11.609 --> 35:12.809
- Yes.
- Yes.

35:12.844 --> 35:14.478
[Dorothy] I can't say no
to this beauty.

35:14.512 --> 35:16.580
[laughter]

35:16.614 --> 35:18.348
- [applause]
- [Dorothy] Try it on.

35:18.382 --> 35:19.483
- [Stacey] Okay.
- [Dorothy] No problem.

35:19.517 --> 35:21.485
Hercules.

35:21.519 --> 35:22.752
[Candace] I'm gonna steal you

35:22.787 --> 35:24.488
and grab the dress off
the mannequin...

35:24.522 --> 35:25.856
- Okay.
- ...so we can try it on.

35:25.890 --> 35:28.625
- Let's do it.
- Woo, look at that.

35:28.659 --> 35:30.427
- I'm feeling good about this.
- You know this--

35:30.461 --> 35:31.862
You know this designer, Pantora?

35:31.896 --> 35:33.697
[Stacey] No. She just told us
she's a new designer.

35:33.731 --> 35:35.765
Yeah, she's a black designer.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.501
<i>- She's amazing.</i>
- [Stacey]<i> We love it already.</i>

35:37.535 --> 35:38.869
[Dorothy]<i> Yes. She's amazing.</i>

35:38.903 --> 35:40.637
<i>- Her name is Andrea.</i>
- [Candace]<i> A young woman.</i>

35:40.671 --> 35:42.672
[Dorothy]<i> She is fabulous.</i>

35:42.707 --> 35:43.573
All right, ladies,
we'll be back.

35:43.608 --> 35:45.408
- [Aikisha] Okay.
- [Stacey] That's amazing.

35:45.443 --> 35:47.577
- [Candace] Yes.
- [Stacey] The designer is new.

35:47.612 --> 35:49.279
African American woman.

35:49.313 --> 35:52.315
A Black woman in Kleinfeld.

35:52.350 --> 35:53.683
- [Candace] Yes.
- That's dope.

35:53.718 --> 35:56.486
[Candace] The only in Kleinfeld.

35:56.521 --> 35:58.622
- The only and the first?
- [Candace] The only

35:58.656 --> 36:01.424
- and the first in Kleinfeld.
- And I--

36:02.793 --> 36:04.261
[Candace] Let's do it.

36:04.295 --> 36:07.397
Come on. Come on. Let's do it.

36:07.431 --> 36:08.765
Representation matters.

36:08.799 --> 36:13.203
So I'm proud that
she's being represented here.

36:13.237 --> 36:15.472
This is the wow.

36:15.506 --> 36:17.140
I hope it fits.

36:22.480 --> 36:23.480
[tense music playing]

36:23.514 --> 36:24.648
Lord, please, let this dress
fit and let it be--

36:24.682 --> 36:27.083
Let it be it,
because this is it.

36:27.118 --> 36:28.585
- Let it be the one, Lord.
- I just feel it in my soul.

36:28.619 --> 36:30.320
[Shameika] All right.

36:30.354 --> 36:31.955
- Amen.
- Amen.

36:32.523 --> 36:36.026
[upbeat music playing]

36:40.464 --> 36:42.332
Yes and yes.

36:42.366 --> 36:45.235
- [Aikisha] I love it.
- Yes, ma'am.

36:46.437 --> 36:48.505
- [Aikisha] Oh, my gosh.
- Yes.

36:48.539 --> 36:51.341
That's how you come in after
your fabulous ceremony dress.

36:51.375 --> 36:52.576
Yes, ma'am, honey.

36:52.610 --> 36:54.344
[Shameika]
This is saying something.

36:54.378 --> 36:56.246
- [Aikisha] Yes.
- [Stacey] Yes. This--

36:57.348 --> 36:58.882
Now, this--
Yes, baby, this is it.

36:58.916 --> 37:01.318
[Shameika] Because we're
gonna mess up our makeup.

37:01.352 --> 37:02.586
[Aikisha] I know.

37:02.620 --> 37:04.654
[Stacey] I love
this part being plain,

37:04.689 --> 37:06.456
kind of like what I was
trying on. And then--

37:06.490 --> 37:08.391
[Aikisha] It's a mixture of...

37:08.426 --> 37:11.328
- Yes.
- ...this was what was missing.

37:11.362 --> 37:12.796
It has that wow factor.

37:12.830 --> 37:15.665
- [Candace] Mmm-hmm.
- [Dorothy] That's Andrea.

37:15.700 --> 37:17.267
- [Shameika] Hey, Andrea.
- [Aikisha] Hi, Andrea.

37:17.301 --> 37:20.170
[Dorothy]
That's Stacey, the bride.

37:20.204 --> 37:21.471
Is she a honey?

37:21.505 --> 37:22.872
<i>Oh, my God.
You look so beautiful.</i>

37:22.907 --> 37:26.376
[Stacey] You are beautiful.
We are so excited.

37:26.410 --> 37:27.811
- All of us.
- Oh, sorry.

37:27.845 --> 37:29.646
- Look at my friends.
- We are so excited

37:29.680 --> 37:31.548
and so happy for you.

37:31.616 --> 37:34.317
- [Andrea]<i> Thank you.</i>
- Like, congratulations to you.

37:34.352 --> 37:35.730
<i>Yes.</i>

37:35.754 --> 37:37.654
[Stacey]<i> I just felt</i>
<i>connected to that dress.</i>

37:37.688 --> 37:41.725
<i>My ceremony dress
is romantic, you know.</i>

37:41.759 --> 37:44.661
This dress is, like, va-va-voom.

37:44.695 --> 37:48.565
[all] Andrea,
ask Stacey the question.

37:48.599 --> 37:50.200
<i>- I get to ask?</i>
- [all] Yes.

37:50.234 --> 37:51.534
[laughter]

37:51.569 --> 37:54.537
<i>Are you saying yes to the dress?</i>

37:54.572 --> 37:57.574
[all] Yes!

37:57.608 --> 37:59.442
[cheers and applause]

37:59.477 --> 38:01.411
We're gonna
have a funky good time.

38:01.445 --> 38:02.579
Yeah.

38:02.613 --> 38:05.215
[Dorothy] We're having fun, too.

38:05.249 --> 38:06.549
It's everything.

38:06.584 --> 38:08.218
<i>- Thank you so much.</i>
- [Stacey] Thank you.

38:08.252 --> 38:09.486
[Candace] Thanks, love.

38:09.520 --> 38:10.887
Now, I'm selling
my best dress out of stock,

38:10.921 --> 38:13.423
so you're gonna have
to make me a new one fast.

38:13.457 --> 38:14.491
[laughter]

38:14.525 --> 38:15.825
The day was rough

38:15.860 --> 38:18.461
because I thought I was
going home with nothing.

38:18.496 --> 38:20.664
<i>But, in the end,</i>

38:20.698 --> 38:23.133
<i>I found my dress and I said</i>

38:23.167 --> 38:25.135
yes to the dress.

38:25.169 --> 38:26.269
Meant to be?

38:26.304 --> 38:28.305
[all] Meant to be.

38:28.339 --> 38:29.572
- Okay.
- [woman] Oh, my gosh.

38:29.607 --> 38:30.473
- Meant to be.
- [Dorothy] Good.

38:30.508 --> 38:32.208
I'm so happy.

38:43.354 --> 38:47.257

38:48.793 --> 38:50.794
[Stacey]<i> I'm so excited.</i>
<i>I'm excited.</i>

38:50.828 --> 38:54.431
<i>This dress is not only
a reception party dress,</i>

38:54.465 --> 38:55.899
we have a big surprise.

38:55.933 --> 38:58.568
<i>A baby bump is gonna be
showing through this dress.</i>

38:58.602 --> 39:01.471
<i>During our reception,
we will be doing</i>

39:01.505 --> 39:03.707
<i>a gender reveal
and our entire family</i>

39:03.741 --> 39:06.276
<i>will find out at the same time.</i>

39:06.310 --> 39:07.377
Many of them don't know.

39:07.411 --> 39:10.046
So, hopefully, it zips up.

39:11.315 --> 39:12.782
<i>I'm feeling really good.</i>

39:12.817 --> 39:15.752
<i>I woke up feeling like I know
I made the right decision.</i>

39:15.786 --> 39:17.654
It's like I'm literally
marrying my best friend.

39:17.688 --> 39:20.390
<i>Like, I've seen my baby
looking beautiful</i>

39:20.424 --> 39:21.758
<i>a million times.</i>

39:21.792 --> 39:23.360
<i>I just know today
is gonna be the day</i>

39:23.394 --> 39:25.562
<i>that it stands out the most.</i>

39:25.596 --> 39:28.398
She's fly as always, so I know
it's gonna be something dope.

39:29.433 --> 39:34.304
[romantic music playing]

39:48.619 --> 39:52.555
[woman]<i> Do you take Stacey</i>
<i>as your wife, as your own,</i>

39:52.590 --> 39:56.426

40:34.799 --> 40:36.866
[Stacey]<i> Now, listen,</i>
<i>that was the first one.</i>

40:36.901 --> 40:39.536
<i>Now, I gotta jump
into my Kleinfeld dress.</i>

40:39.570 --> 40:41.538
- I'm excited. Let's do it.

40:43.641 --> 40:45.375
- We ready.
- We ready.

40:45.409 --> 40:46.643
[Aikisha] Give them a spin.
Turn around

40:46.677 --> 40:48.411
so they can see
the front and back.

40:48.446 --> 40:49.479
Mmm-hmm.

40:49.513 --> 40:52.282
The dress turned out perfect

40:52.349 --> 40:53.483
for the reception.

40:53.517 --> 40:54.751
It feels good.

40:54.785 --> 40:57.120
I can't wait
for everyone to see it.

40:57.154 --> 40:58.588
I can't wait to do
the gender reveal

40:58.622 --> 41:00.824
and I can't wait for my husband

41:00.858 --> 41:03.226
to see it and take it off.

41:03.260 --> 41:04.360
[man]<i> For the first time,</i>

Stacey's reception dress,

41:14.738 --> 41:17.273
I feel like she had them out.

41:17.308 --> 41:19.242
So, uh, I like it.

41:19.276 --> 41:20.543
I loved it.

41:20.578 --> 41:23.346
<i>I loved it.
My baby looked perfect.</i>

41:24.415 --> 41:27.250

<i>It's a girl!</i>

41:43.501 --> 41:46.636
[cheers and applause]

41:46.670 --> 41:49.706
I just found out we're having...

41:49.740 --> 41:52.342
- [Dalen]<i> A girl. A girl.</i>
- [Stacey]<i> ...a baby girl.</i>

41:53.544 --> 41:56.112
You're about to be a girl dad.

41:57.548 --> 42:00.583
Babe, you did an excellent job
planning this wedding.

42:00.618 --> 42:03.586
Not only did you plan it,
you planned it while pregnant.

42:03.621 --> 42:05.688
<i>Walking into this today,
I was speechless.</i>

42:05.723 --> 42:08.324
[Stacey]<i> And I did it in three</i>
<i>and a half months.</i>

42:08.359 --> 42:09.692
[Dalen]<i> You did.</i>

42:09.727 --> 42:11.528
[Stacey]<i> I think</i>
<i>that's pretty spectacular.</i>

42:11.562 --> 42:12.929
<i>- You did.
- Three and a half months.</i>

42:12.963 --> 42:15.298
So if anybody needs a wedding
organizer or planner.

42:15.332 --> 42:16.566
I don't plan weddings.

42:16.600 --> 42:18.234
We setting the fees high.
But we got you.

42:18.269 --> 42:20.103
- No, we don't.
- No.

42:22.373 --> 42:24.941
[cheers and applause]
