turned out to be an ingrown.

We'd gotten through
it all expertly

00:16.349 --> 00:19.894

Ryan looks at you.

it's Todd from Pre-Cal.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.972
Promise me
you'll come tomorrow night.

09:16.013 --> 09:17.265
Who am I kidding? I..

09:17.306 --> 09:19.141
I won't be able to stop myself.

09:19.183 --> 09:21.519
It will be a night to remember.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.647
Okay. I'm gonna
hold you to that.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.774
Yeah, I'll rush over as soon
as Wolfe leaves for boxing.

09:28.776 --> 09:30.653
Oh, gosh.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.780
Oh, my God!

09:32.822 --> 09:34.365
Chef Alan's cheating!

09:34.407 --> 09:36.784
Oh, my God. Mr. Wolfe boxes?

09:36.826 --> 09:38.786
Unless that's gay slang.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.458
Okay, after watching
today's practice

09:44.500 --> 09:46.627
it's clear to me you know little
if anything about the game.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.170
I don't mean to be harsh

09:48.212 --> 09:50.131
but there is no way
you are going to win.

09:50.172 --> 09:53.092
George, take that back.
Failure is not an option.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.303
It's one of my top three
most hated things

09:55.344 --> 09:57.888
right behind
decorated denim and pinheads.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.932
Well, I'm sorry, but you
can't have a T-ball team

09:59.974 --> 10:02.643
that doesn't know
how to play T-ball.

10:02.685 --> 10:05.354
Will you help us?

10:05.396 --> 10:07.356
I really don't want
to get involved

10:07.398 --> 10:09.025
in this feud
between you and Noah.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.943
But how are we supposed
to settle it fair and square

10:10.985 --> 10:12.903
when our team is at
a distinct disadvantage

10:12.945 --> 10:15.573
on account of me not knowing
jack squat about T-ball?

10:15.615 --> 10:17.575
You got a point.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.410
Plus, I'm your girl.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.705
You can't just let another
man take a dookie on my dignity.

10:22.747 --> 10:25.333
[laughing]
Dallas, alright.

10:25.374 --> 10:27.084
If I agree to help you out

10:27.126 --> 10:30.046
we've gotta focus on the
fundamentals, not the fun.

10:30.087 --> 10:32.048
Sure! That sounds like fun.

10:32.089 --> 10:34.675
- What? No, it's not.
- Right.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.844
What I meant was, it sounds
like a real good time.

10:36.886 --> 10:39.013
It's not gonna be a good time.
It's gonna be lots of work.

10:39.055 --> 10:42.141
But in the end

10:42.183 --> 10:45.144
the hard work will pay off
when we defeat Noah Werner

10:45.186 --> 10:47.938
and that'll be fun.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.774
[whistle blowing]

10:49.815 --> 10:52.151
Look, I know some of you
are disappointed.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.737
You.. You miss Dallas'
way of doing things

10:54.779 --> 10:56.781
and you miss
your sparkly uniforms.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.783
But those uniforms
were hurting us.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.534
- Mine didn't hurt.
- It did, Kevin.

11:00.576 --> 11:01.827
You just didn't know it did.

11:01.869 --> 11:04.372
My name's not Kevin.
It's Kevuel.

11:04.413 --> 11:06.374
I'm Kimantha's brother.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.335
Okay. Gang, to win

11:09.377 --> 11:12.546
we're gonna have to look
and act normal

11:12.588 --> 11:14.590
like professional
T-ball players.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.258
'So from this point on'

11:16.300 --> 11:17.927
Kevuel's gonna be "Kevin"

11:17.968 --> 11:21.097
and all of us are gonna
focus on fundamentals.

11:21.138 --> 11:22.973
We're gonna work
on our fielding

11:23.015 --> 11:24.934
we're gonna work
on our hitting

11:24.975 --> 11:27.311
and we're gonna work on
building a winning team

11:27.353 --> 11:28.396
if that's okay.

11:28.437 --> 11:30.523
'Is that okay?'

11:31.774 --> 11:33.734
I said, is that okay?!

11:33.776 --> 11:35.778
Yeah, it's okay, George.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.238
But can we still
do our fancy runs?

11:37.279 --> 11:39.365
No. No! No fancy runs.

11:39.407 --> 11:42.993
But our fancy runs show the
other team our individuality!

11:43.035 --> 11:44.370
- Yeah!
- No. No, Nicole.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.705
No, our fancy runs show the
other team

11:45.746 --> 11:47.623
we have no idea
what we're doing.

11:47.665 --> 11:50.126
Alright, guys. Let's get
to work! Grab your mitts!

Stay in front of those!
Jenni could've gotten that one.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.182
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

12:46.223 --> 12:48.350
- Nothing.
- You mean because I'm a girl?

12:48.392 --> 12:51.562
No. No, I mean
because you're...not good.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.606
I'm tired.
Do you have any frozen treats?

12:53.647 --> 12:55.483
Frozen treats? What?

12:55.524 --> 12:58.027
I'm your coach.
I'm not the ice-cream man.

12:58.068 --> 13:01.280
I don't even think this
jackass has a juice box on him.

13:01.322 --> 13:04.116
- Yeah, and he's sexist.
- Okay, you know what?

13:04.158 --> 13:05.743
It'd be sexist
if I didn't tell you the truth.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.244
Ugh!

13:07.286 --> 13:08.704
- Okay, she's angry. Good!
- I quit!

13:08.746 --> 13:10.414
That's good!
We can use that anger!

13:10.456 --> 13:12.541
George, I think
you're losing 'em.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.919
I'm not losing them.
I'm-I'm breaking them.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.253
And then
I'm gonna rebuild them!

13:16.295 --> 13:18.380
Oh! You mean
like Jill Werner did

13:18.422 --> 13:20.633
with her pre-marital hook nose?

13:20.674 --> 13:21.926
Kind of.

13:21.967 --> 13:24.553
Stand up, guys.
Come on! Stand up!

13:24.595 --> 13:26.472
'St.. I'm..
I'm gonna hit it either way.'

13:32.937 --> 13:35.439
He really is boxing.
That is not gay slang.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.441
Punch with your legs,
not your ovaries.

13:39.443 --> 13:40.736
Mr. Wolfe,
what are you doing?

13:40.778 --> 13:42.530
I'm training the next
middleweight champion

13:42.571 --> 13:44.490
of the world.
What are you doing?

13:44.532 --> 13:47.076
There is so much we don't
know about his private life.

13:47.117 --> 13:49.203
Mr. Wolfe,
I really need to talk to you.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.205
You might wanna
sit down for this.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.841
It's worse than I thought.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.926
Chefs Alan and Norman..

14:03.968 --> 14:04.969
...are having an affair.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.720
[gasps and gags]

14:08.305 --> 14:10.933
Worst time to put
water in someone's mouth.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.394
And you practically drowned me.

14:13.435 --> 14:14.436
There ya go.

14:14.478 --> 14:15.771
Lisa and I overheard them

14:15.813 --> 14:17.356
planning a hookup
in the cafeteria.

14:17.398 --> 14:18.941
I wouldn't say anything
unless I was 100% sure.

14:18.983 --> 14:21.735
Some of us
are a little shy of 100%.

14:21.777 --> 14:24.071
Some of us
are hovering around 12%.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.406
He told me
he was just going over

14:25.447 --> 14:27.241
to Chef Norman's
to watch the Oscars.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.660
Yeah? Did he? Then why didn't
he invite you to go with him?

14:29.702 --> 14:32.538
He knows that I've boycotted
the Oscars every year

14:32.580 --> 14:34.790
since the soul-crushing
tragedy of '93.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.041
What that the year..

14:36.083 --> 14:37.668
And the nominees are..

14:37.710 --> 14:39.211
...Judy Davis..

14:39.253 --> 14:40.588
...Joan Plowright..

14:40.629 --> 14:42.381
...Vanessa freakin' Redgrave..

14:42.423 --> 14:43.674
And the Oscar goes to..

14:43.716 --> 14:46.510
Marisa Tomei
for "My Cousin Vinny".

14:46.552 --> 14:49.722
That was the homosexual
O.J. verdict.

14:49.763 --> 14:51.223
So that's why
they didn't invite him.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.600
Maybe they really are
having an Oscar party.

14:52.641 --> 14:54.768
Yeah. No, maybe they are..

14:56.520 --> 14:58.480
...in their pants.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.280
Hope you don't mind.
I let myself in.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.656
Noah! Jeez! What the heck?

15:07.698 --> 15:09.325
You trying to give me
a heart attack?

15:09.366 --> 15:11.577
I might ask you
the same thing.

15:11.619 --> 15:12.870
Wow!

15:12.912 --> 15:16.081
What is with
the new 'do...Mufasa?

15:16.123 --> 15:17.917
Oh, ho ho ho ho!

15:17.958 --> 15:20.753
Oh, you're hilarious George.
You should open for Louis C.K.

15:20.794 --> 15:22.796
- Really? You think I'm ready?
- Oh, absolutely.

15:22.838 --> 15:24.715
I-I think he'd be lucky
to have you.

15:24.757 --> 15:25.883
Once he hears that great joke

15:25.925 --> 15:27.718
about you helping Dallas
defeat me.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.471
Is this about T-ball?
Is that what this is?

15:30.512 --> 15:31.722
Yes.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.265
That's what this is.

15:33.307 --> 15:36.852
Look at you...with a
whistle around your neck.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.896
You disgust me.

15:38.938 --> 15:42.024
I thought that you were
Crockett and I was Tubbs!

15:42.066 --> 15:46.153
I thought that you were
Tango and I was Cash!

15:46.195 --> 15:49.573
I thought that
you were Dunston..

15:49.615 --> 15:52.159
...and I had checked in!

15:52.201 --> 15:54.912
- Sorry?
- You haven't seen that movie?

15:54.954 --> 15:57.331
It's about this monkey
and this hotel..

15:57.373 --> 15:59.500
They're best friends!

15:59.541 --> 16:01.377
Yeah, but the only thing
you wanna check into anymore

16:01.418 --> 16:02.461
is your girlfriend.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.880
Okay, Noah,
listen to yourself.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.215
Okay, look at your hair!

16:06.256 --> 16:09.051
This war between you
and Dallas has to stop.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.762
I'm begging you.
Settle it on the T-ball field

16:11.804 --> 16:13.889
and then move on
with your lives.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.016
She's taken
everything from me, George.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.726
Everything.

16:17.768 --> 16:20.562
And now I'm gonna take
everything from you

16:20.604 --> 16:22.022
starting right there.

16:22.064 --> 16:23.691
Ah, ha ha ha!

16:23.732 --> 16:25.693
Ha!

16:28.070 --> 16:30.030
Whoops! Mine now.

16:33.534 --> 16:37.246
Oh, hope you
don't make any spills.

16:37.287 --> 16:38.706
Huh?

16:38.747 --> 16:40.457
Really? You're gonna
take my smoke detector?

16:40.499 --> 16:42.876
Oh, yeah! I'm taking everything.

16:45.295 --> 16:47.256
Everything!

16:50.676 --> 16:52.970
I feel weird.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.264
We didn't even
fill out an Oscar ballot.

16:55.305 --> 16:57.599
Since it's not a real Oscar
party, it doesn't matter.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.478
How can you be so sure?

17:01.520 --> 17:04.189
Look, I know sometimes
it's hard to

17:04.231 --> 17:06.066
confront things in a
relationship we don't want to

17:06.108 --> 17:08.944
but if Chef Alan is not
being honest with you

17:08.986 --> 17:10.946
don't you wanna know?

17:16.368 --> 17:18.037
Oh, thank God!

17:18.078 --> 17:20.039
Look, "Ask Tessa"

17:20.080 --> 17:22.624
'it's just boring old
Alan sitting on the couch.'

17:22.666 --> 17:24.626
For a moment,
we thought you were..

17:27.296 --> 17:28.964
What's that?

17:29.006 --> 17:30.966
Uh, what's what?

17:31.008 --> 17:32.509
That thing.

17:32.551 --> 17:37.806
And the award for best
original tongue kiss goes to...

17:37.848 --> 17:39.808
Oh.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.896
Uh.. On the bright side

17:43.937 --> 17:46.982
this takes the whole sting out
of the Marisa Tomei incident.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.488
Alright, buddy! Good hit!
Good swing, man!

17:52.529 --> 17:53.822
Whoo! Way to go!

17:53.864 --> 17:55.532
Way to make it
to the filthy pillow!

17:55.574 --> 17:57.076
Look, George, they're doing it!

17:57.117 --> 17:58.327
We're gonna beat him
to a bloody pulp!

17:58.368 --> 17:59.411
Oh, yeah.

17:59.453 --> 18:00.704
What the hell was that, Seth?

18:00.746 --> 18:02.664
Oh, I actually
hate you right now.

18:02.706 --> 18:04.750
I hate you
outside of the game.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.211
Not as a first baseman,
as a person!

18:07.252 --> 18:10.047
- You guys suck!
- What's your problem?

18:10.089 --> 18:12.591
You stink!

18:12.633 --> 18:14.843
You're a bunch of hacks!

18:14.885 --> 18:17.262
'Losers! Losers!'

18:17.304 --> 18:18.764
Dallas, I think I was wrong.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.432
Sweep the leg!

18:20.474 --> 18:22.893
Whoa. No, don't sweep anything.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.646
- Look at these kids.
- You guys stink!

18:25.687 --> 18:27.356
- I ruined them.
- You guys suck!

18:27.397 --> 18:29.566
You were right. They..
They should be playing for fun.

18:29.608 --> 18:30.901
They should be..

18:30.943 --> 18:33.612
...playing for wristlets
and-and fancy runs

18:33.654 --> 18:35.322
and frozen treats.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.533
Those things
would've cost us our victory.

18:37.574 --> 18:39.535
We can win this, George.

18:39.576 --> 18:40.911
Sweep the leg!

18:40.953 --> 18:42.287
Fine. Sweep the leg.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.331
Sweep the leg if you
care more about winning

18:44.373 --> 18:46.166
than you do about humanity.

18:46.208 --> 18:49.837
Sweep the leg if you want this
petty rivalry to own your soul.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.630
- Sweep the leg if--
- You heard him!

18:51.672 --> 18:56.051
Sweep the leg!

18:56.093 --> 18:58.053
No. No.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.018
(boy #1)
'Ow!'

19:05.060 --> 19:08.856
Visitors disqualified!
The dental decay sluggers win!

19:08.897 --> 19:10.816
- Yeah!
- Boom!

19:10.858 --> 19:12.609
Yeah! Oh, man.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.236
Well done!

19:14.278 --> 19:15.904
- You had to know.
- What?

19:15.946 --> 19:18.824
You had to know that your
kid would be disqualified

19:18.866 --> 19:19.992
for cobra kai'ing
my third baseman.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.243
And I know why you did it.

19:21.285 --> 19:22.411
(boy #1)
'Ow!'

19:22.452 --> 19:23.787
- You did it for me.
- N-no.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.372
Noah, I didn't do it for you.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.416
I tried very hard
to stop it, actually.

19:27.457 --> 19:28.876
No.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.210
I know you did.

19:30.252 --> 19:32.546
You did everything you could.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.214
I would do the same thing
for you, buddy.

19:34.256 --> 19:37.426
Any one of these kids.
You just say the word.

19:37.467 --> 19:38.468
Thanks?

19:38.510 --> 19:40.345
Which kid, though?

19:40.387 --> 19:42.806
I need to know which kid.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.808
Unless you want me to pick.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.021
Just remember..

19:49.062 --> 19:50.564
...you're the reason
we won this game.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.149
I don't know what came over me.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.568
And it's not like playing
dirty helped. We lost!

19:55.819 --> 19:56.987
- Did we?
- Yes.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.363
I checked the scoreboard
to make sure.

19:58.405 --> 20:00.199
No, I meant in a bigger sense.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.409
Yeah, I know. We lost
in a bigger sense, too.

20:02.451 --> 20:03.619
Poor sportsmanship..

20:03.660 --> 20:05.579
Ugly, ugly costumes..

20:05.621 --> 20:07.122
'...and we injured a boy.'

20:07.164 --> 20:10.125
Yes, but we learned
an important lesson..

20:11.043 --> 20:12.586
...which means we won.

20:12.628 --> 20:14.338
George, you're looking
on the bright side.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.381
- You got that from me.
- Ow!

20:16.423 --> 20:17.591
[kid screaming]

20:17.633 --> 20:20.052
Well, I can't un-break his leg

20:20.093 --> 20:22.638
but I can un-break
this feud with Noah Werner.

20:25.015 --> 20:27.643
Wait. You can un-break it?

20:27.684 --> 20:28.977
That means the feud's back on.

20:29.019 --> 20:31.563
You wanna break it,
not un-break it.

20:31.605 --> 20:33.982
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

20:34.024 --> 20:36.193
(Noah)
Great job out there.

20:41.365 --> 20:44.618
Sometimes doing the right
thing still feels wrong.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.079
There's nothing a 2-day
old gingersnap can't fix.

20:49.665 --> 20:52.251
How about adultery?

20:52.292 --> 20:54.086
"Ask Tessa" knew it all along.

20:54.127 --> 20:56.088
I wish she was wrong, but..

20:56.129 --> 20:57.506
...she just never is.

20:57.547 --> 21:00.842
No, not when it comes to
other people's problems.

21:00.884 --> 21:02.427
Are we off me already?

21:02.469 --> 21:04.179
What are you
trying to say, Lisa?

21:05.264 --> 21:07.766
I'm trying to say that

21:07.808 --> 21:11.019
sometimes it's easier to
diagnose other people's problems

21:11.061 --> 21:13.021
than your own.

21:15.565 --> 21:17.943
There's no such thing
as a 3-day away game?

21:20.195 --> 21:22.572
There is no such thing
as a 3-day away game.
