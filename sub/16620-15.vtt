Guys, don't look now,
but Henry Haber and Todd

00:25.636 --> 00:28.587
are walking this way and they're wearing
suit jackets.

00:28.639 --> 00:30.804
- Narcs!
- Oh, hi, Todd, hi, Henry.

00:30.891 --> 00:32.691
So, small talk.

00:32.726 --> 00:34.226
Uh, what about it?

00:34.278 --> 00:35.778
Just getting it out of the way.

00:35.813 --> 00:37.980
Tina, how'd you like
to join the debate team?

00:38.032 --> 00:39.315
Debate? Why me?

00:39.367 --> 00:40.983
We have to have at least one girl

00:41.035 --> 00:43.279
and our last one quit
to focus on spelling bee.

00:43.304 --> 00:44.320
O-U-C-H.

00:44.372 --> 00:46.372
Anyway, uh, we need another girl

00:46.407 --> 00:48.907
and thought of you almost immediately.

00:48.959 --> 00:51.910
Well, I'm flattered. But I'm pretty
slammed with social commitments.

00:51.962 --> 00:53.796
I'm on-again off-again with Jimmy Jr.,

00:53.831 --> 00:57.116
and I think I'm about to hit
a sweet patch of on-again.

00:57.141 --> 00:59.406
Where is he, anyway?
He was maybe gonna sit here.

00:59.431 --> 01:01.431
Tamica, look, I can kiss my elbow.

01:01.463 --> 01:04.203
- (groaning)
- Cool.

01:04.227 --> 01:05.914
And... you're off again.

01:05.939 --> 01:08.055
Ugh, so now we're
elbow kissing everyone?

01:08.150 --> 01:11.185
Okay, looks like my schedule
might be wide open, actually.

01:11.431 --> 01:13.047
I don't have to talk in debate, right?

01:13.072 --> 01:15.412

- Oh, boy.

- _
- MR. DeSANTO: Welcome to

01:16.946 --> 01:18.843
- our newest debater, Tina.
- Thanks, Mr. DeSanto.

01:18.868 --> 01:20.020
You know most of these jokers.

01:20.045 --> 01:23.262
Larry's our policy ace,
Zach's a research machine,

01:23.287 --> 01:25.184
and Todd's a ninja with sarcasm.

01:25.209 --> 01:26.770
Sarcasm, huh. Any good?

01:26.795 --> 01:28.211
(sarcastic): No, I'm terrible.

01:28.236 --> 01:30.684
- Oh, that's too bad.
- Ugh, I was doing it!

01:30.709 --> 01:32.661
All right, tomorrow's debate topic is:

01:32.686 --> 01:34.986
"Should the U.S. switch
to the metric system?"

01:35.011 --> 01:36.778
Oh, fun, I love the metric system.

01:36.803 --> 01:38.419
I give it a ten out of ten.

01:38.566 --> 01:40.801
(chuckling) Get it? Everything's ten?

01:40.826 --> 01:42.409
Uh, tough luck, kiddo.

01:42.434 --> 01:44.364
We've been assigned the
negative, against it.

01:44.389 --> 01:46.389
But shouldn't we argue
for what we really believe?

01:46.414 --> 01:48.581
- (boys laugh)
- Guys, guys.

01:48.606 --> 01:51.161
Tina, pretending to
strongly believe in something

01:51.186 --> 01:53.637
that you don't is great
preparation for being, like,

01:53.662 --> 01:55.598
a lawyer, or a stepdad.

01:55.623 --> 01:57.481
I guess I might be
one of those some day.

01:57.506 --> 01:59.517
You just have to stuff
down your feelings

01:59.542 --> 02:00.958
and stop believing in anything.

02:00.983 --> 02:02.182
I think I can do that.

02:02.207 --> 02:03.406
I mean, I don't think I can,

02:03.431 --> 02:04.473
but I'm pretending I can.

02:04.498 --> 02:06.286
Now you're getting it!

02:06.588 --> 02:09.155
Aw, my talky Tina
joined the debate team?

02:09.180 --> 02:10.833
- You gonna miss her?
- Yes.

02:10.858 --> 02:13.025
It throws off our whole
after-school play routine.

02:13.058 --> 02:16.255
Usually we just do the opposite of
what Tina wants to do and it's fun.

02:16.280 --> 02:18.512
This is gonna sound
crazy, but you guys could

02:18.537 --> 02:19.864
get started on your homework.

02:19.889 --> 02:23.002
(laughing): Yeah that
does sound crazy, Dad.

02:23.034 --> 02:25.614
- BOB: Mm.
- It's not due till tomorrow, buddy.

02:25.639 --> 02:27.472
Plus I don't even know
where my backpack is.

02:27.497 --> 02:29.113
- Whoa. Gene!
- Oh, whoopsie.

02:29.138 --> 02:30.786
GENE: Yes I see it, Dad, thanks.

02:30.811 --> 02:34.005
Oh, my God, now we have to throw out
ten pounds of hamburger meat.

02:34.030 --> 02:35.913
Um, can we have it?

02:35.938 --> 02:37.605
Why would you want that?

02:37.630 --> 02:39.413
I don't know, I just... I want it.

02:39.438 --> 02:41.555
- I don't think that's a...
- Please?

02:41.580 --> 02:43.580
We won't ask for any meat
for Christmas this year.

02:43.605 --> 02:45.238
Let 'em have the meat, Bob.

02:45.263 --> 02:47.560
- Let 'em play with it.
- Fine.

02:47.585 --> 02:49.218
Y-You know you have to wash your hands

02:49.253 --> 02:50.414
after you play with it, right?

02:50.439 --> 02:52.039
I mean, technically meat's not a toy.

02:52.064 --> 02:53.480
I'm gonna bring it in the tub.

02:53.505 --> 02:55.171
Everything's a toy in there.

02:56.086 --> 02:58.203
MR. DeSANTO: Tina, how you doing
on that list of tongue twisters?

02:58.228 --> 03:00.133
Getting your speed
up? Your articulation?

03:00.158 --> 03:01.708
I'm still stuck on the first one.

03:01.749 --> 03:04.351
"Ten... tongue... twisters."

03:04.376 --> 03:06.461
That one's not actually
a... you know what?

03:06.486 --> 03:09.000
I'm gonna hand you over
to our top debater, Henry.

03:09.046 --> 03:10.512
(sighs) Fine.

03:10.539 --> 03:12.372
So we're both excited, that's great.

03:12.417 --> 03:15.201
Now we need to find some
passion in your delivery.

03:15.253 --> 03:16.786
What really gets you going?

03:16.838 --> 03:18.038
You mean what makes me tick?

03:18.090 --> 03:20.590
What makes you tick-tick-tick explode?

03:20.626 --> 03:22.342
Think of things that get you mad.

03:22.377 --> 03:25.629
I think of when they
canceled Firefly. You try.

03:25.681 --> 03:27.517
(sighs) I guess it makes me mad

03:27.542 --> 03:29.774
that they call it your bottom
when it's in the middle.

03:29.799 --> 03:32.313
- Okay.
- Or why do horseshoes

03:32.338 --> 03:33.520
only come in one style?

03:33.555 --> 03:35.221
Why can't they have horse sandals?

03:35.273 --> 03:36.856
Find your Firefly, come on.

03:36.892 --> 03:39.025
I got a Canadian quarter in change.

03:39.061 --> 03:40.860
It's worthless unless
I take a special trip

03:40.896 --> 03:42.812
to Canada to buy gum. (groans)

03:42.864 --> 03:43.780
You'll get there.

03:43.994 --> 03:45.922
Look, a meat-eor.

03:45.947 --> 03:48.451
- Eh, I guess it's just a meatball.
- That's great.

03:48.487 --> 03:50.320
But what do you think about this?

03:50.372 --> 03:52.322
- Hubba hubba.
- We need a picture.

03:52.374 --> 03:54.290
- Gene, go get Mom's phone.
- On it!

03:54.326 --> 03:55.945
Got it! All you have to do

03:55.970 --> 03:57.794
is ask Mom a math question and she says,

03:57.829 --> 03:59.329
"Here, there's a
calculator on the phone.

03:59.381 --> 04:01.414
- Don't make me do math!"
- Great.

04:01.466 --> 04:02.966
- (camera shutter sound)
- Give me sassy.

04:03.001 --> 04:04.384
Now give me classy.

04:04.419 --> 04:05.885
Now gassy.

04:05.921 --> 04:07.137
Wait a minute. (chuckles)

04:07.172 --> 04:09.617
- Gene, stop-motion!
- Okay, now what?

04:09.642 --> 04:11.007
No, if we move him a little

04:11.059 --> 04:13.643
and take another picture,
and keep doing it,

04:13.679 --> 04:16.096
we can make a movie. Meat-mation!

04:16.148 --> 04:18.481
Oh, my God, this is the most
exciting thing we've ever done!

04:18.517 --> 04:20.483
Okay. Reposition very slightly,

04:20.603 --> 04:22.736
another click, reposition...

04:22.771 --> 04:24.158
And now I'm bored.

04:24.908 --> 04:26.906
And if we adopt the metric system,

04:26.942 --> 04:28.692
when someone says "Thanks a ton,"

04:28.744 --> 04:30.777
you won't actually know how
much they're thanking you.

04:30.829 --> 04:32.495
Oh, my God, she's a dud.

04:32.531 --> 04:34.864
She's a dud, she is a dud.

04:34.916 --> 04:37.083
(whispers): Find your Firefly.

04:37.119 --> 04:38.418
I mean...

04:38.453 --> 04:39.869
(slow motion): Tamica, look,

04:39.921 --> 04:42.839
I can kiss my elbow.

04:42.874 --> 04:45.425
(groans) T-The metric system is dumb!

04:45.460 --> 04:47.594
We already have grams,
they're called "grandmas"

04:47.629 --> 04:49.512
and mine lives in Florida, thank you.

04:49.548 --> 04:51.047
And if she has to learn
kilometers she's gonna get lost

04:51.099 --> 04:52.465
and never make it back to the condo.

04:52.517 --> 04:54.217
This is America, damn
it, and we're the leader

04:54.269 --> 04:55.885
of the free world, not the liter.

04:55.937 --> 04:57.971

04:58.023 --> 04:59.272
Whoa.

04:59.307 --> 05:01.224
Counterpoint... wow.

05:01.276 --> 05:03.143
She's amazing.

05:03.195 --> 05:06.029
And then you brought up foot-long
hot dogs, which was great.

05:06.064 --> 05:07.897
And then you pointed out
that inchworms were cute,

05:07.949 --> 05:09.399
but centipedes were gross.

05:09.451 --> 05:11.785
- And then you're so beautiful.
- Um, what?

05:11.820 --> 05:13.620
Uh, it's-- debate exercise.

05:13.655 --> 05:15.872
Proposition, uh, we should go on a date.

05:15.907 --> 05:17.907
You take pro, I'll take con. Go.

05:17.959 --> 05:20.960
But dating isn't debatable.
Everything's debatable.

05:20.996 --> 05:25.165
Okay, um, we should
go on a date because...

05:25.217 --> 05:28.134
Pro: we both live on land.

05:28.170 --> 05:30.053
Con: people find me annoying.

05:30.088 --> 05:32.088
Pro: oh, we're not
related to each other.

05:32.140 --> 05:33.840
Con: I get really, uh, bad haircuts.

05:33.892 --> 05:36.226
Pro: You don't have a rat
tail; that's my deal-breaker.

05:36.261 --> 05:38.762
Con: I have a rare
kind of contagious acne.

05:38.814 --> 05:40.396
Um, um, um, um, pro:

05:40.432 --> 05:42.432
bears are less likely to
attack two people than one.

05:42.484 --> 05:44.601
Okay, I give up, I concede, you win.

05:44.653 --> 05:45.852
We should go on a date.

05:45.904 --> 05:47.558
Damn, I even convinced myself.

05:47.621 --> 05:48.729
I'm that good.

No, Tina, I'll be there.

In fact, let me give you
an emergency contact number

06:08.927 --> 06:11.544
because if I don't show
up,, you can assume I'm dead.

06:11.596 --> 06:13.680

this for sure of a date.

07:52.538 --> 07:54.261
Someone did his research.

07:54.286 --> 07:56.152
Yep, he has my blessing.

07:56.177 --> 07:58.711
So Henry seems... to be here.

07:58.736 --> 08:00.300
Uh, what's going on with that?

08:00.347 --> 08:01.813
Henry's thoughtful and attentive.

08:01.848 --> 08:03.696
Other than my total lack
of attraction to him,

08:03.721 --> 08:05.964
- he's perfect boyfriend material.
- He is?

08:05.989 --> 08:08.903
Well, I mean he's made out of the
same material as a boyfriend.

08:08.938 --> 08:12.240
Well, I guess you... solved... romance.

08:12.275 --> 08:14.128
Yeah. Phew.

08:14.471 --> 08:16.411
So that was fun, Henry.

08:16.446 --> 08:17.662
I mean, sort of.

08:17.697 --> 08:19.113
Sorry if I was a telescope hog.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.832
No, you gave me a peek
there near the end.

08:20.867 --> 08:22.116
I got the idea.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.835
- Stars, right?
- Yeah, planets.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.169
And here we are back at my door.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.504
20 minutes after we left.

08:26.539 --> 08:27.872
So at the end of dates

08:27.924 --> 08:30.258
is when I hear kisses occur.

08:30.293 --> 08:32.210
And we're at the end of the date,

08:32.261 --> 08:34.294
therefore, we should probably...

08:34.347 --> 08:35.847
Uh, rebuttal,

08:35.881 --> 08:37.765
we have to debate with these mouths.

08:37.801 --> 08:39.183
Don't want to risk injury, right?

08:39.219 --> 08:41.246
God, I love it when you're debatey.

08:41.639 --> 08:43.438
LOUISE: Okay, genre-wise,

08:43.472 --> 08:45.356
this is straight up
action-adventure, Rom-com,

08:45.392 --> 08:46.997
costume, drama, buddy movie.

08:47.022 --> 08:48.178
Oh, I love those.

08:48.203 --> 08:50.733
LOUISE: So in this shot,
Meat Man and Lorna scream

08:50.758 --> 08:53.777
through the Moscow streets
avoiding rogue CIA agents

08:53.829 --> 08:56.381
till they get to the one
person he trusts, Poopov.

08:56.406 --> 08:58.569
Uh, can anyone do a Russian accent?

08:58.601 --> 08:59.592
- I can.
- Vodka.

08:59.617 --> 09:01.225
- Da, da.
- All good, all good.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.049
- Uh, I guess Dad.
- Damn it!

09:03.074 --> 09:05.574
(with accent): "At
last we meet, Meat Man."

09:05.599 --> 09:07.397
Is anyone else hearing Dracula?

09:07.422 --> 09:09.233
- (normal voice): Um, Louise?
- Yeah, hon? How can I help?

09:09.258 --> 09:10.933
Do you really want that
double meat in there?

09:10.958 --> 09:12.053
You have "meet Meat?"

09:12.078 --> 09:13.828
Oh, wow, that's a good point.

09:13.853 --> 09:15.498
Thanks. Maybe we change it to:

09:15.523 --> 09:17.944
(with accent): "At last
we are face-to-face... "

09:17.969 --> 09:19.428
Let's cut it since you
don't want to say it.

09:19.453 --> 09:21.187
They'll communicate
with a look, let's go.

09:21.223 --> 09:22.472
- A-A look?
- Mm-hmm.

09:22.524 --> 09:24.045
Nice going, hot shot,
you lost your line.

09:24.070 --> 09:26.256
Roll camera and action.

09:26.281 --> 09:28.787
(wheels squeaking, clattering)

09:28.812 --> 09:30.920
They exchange a look, and cut.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.506
We're moving on to Cairo.

09:32.531 --> 09:34.114
♪
♪ Are zoos humane?

09:34.139 --> 09:36.139
Well, my anaconda don't want none.

09:36.164 --> 09:37.664
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

09:42.327 --> 09:44.294
Put boys and girls in separate classes?

09:44.329 --> 09:46.412
Is this middle school
or the Middle Ages?

09:46.464 --> 09:48.400
(whispers): I'm dating her.

09:53.805 --> 09:56.806
And that, my fellow Americans,
is why we should eat dog.

09:56.831 --> 09:58.698
- (dramatic news theme plays)
- _

09:58.723 --> 10:00.306
Hey, it's Jocelyn.

10:00.331 --> 10:03.127
I'm here with Mr. DeSanto,
who coaches the debate team,

10:03.152 --> 10:04.908
which I think is gymnastics?

10:04.933 --> 10:06.197
That's right, Jocelyn.

10:06.222 --> 10:08.568
This weekend we go
against King's Head Island.

10:08.603 --> 10:11.187
And if we win we'll be
bringing home the first trophy

10:11.239 --> 10:14.407
- for the Wagstaff trophy case.
- You mean the turtle tank?

10:14.442 --> 10:16.230
MR. DeSANTO: Well, it's
supposed to be a trophy case.

10:16.255 --> 10:17.622
But there are turtles in it.

10:17.647 --> 10:19.347
Which is going to change!

10:19.372 --> 10:21.781
We are gonna be bringing home the iron.

10:21.833 --> 10:23.449
But where will the turtles live?

10:23.509 --> 10:25.126
I don't f-- I don't know. I don't know.

10:25.170 --> 10:27.453
Just don't make it about
the turtles, Jocelyn.

10:27.505 --> 10:31.100
Okay, guys, this is a debate
team away match overnight.

10:31.125 --> 10:32.889
- So bring your medication
- Mm-hmm.

10:32.914 --> 10:35.296
- your mouth guards, nasal strips...
- Yep. Nasal strips.

10:35.321 --> 10:36.535
... whatever you need to
have a good night's sleep

10:36.560 --> 10:38.077
- Mm-hmm.
- for a strong debate.

10:38.102 --> 10:40.014
Also, we have received our topic.

10:40.039 --> 10:41.811
"Should a robot be president?"

10:41.836 --> 10:43.886
Classic. Logic or emotion.

10:43.911 --> 10:45.494
The old head versus heart.

10:45.519 --> 10:47.249
Hope you guys can prep for the debate

10:47.274 --> 10:48.804
with all those smoochatunities
on the overnight.

10:48.829 --> 10:51.029
- (laughs)
- Please. Kissing's overrated.

10:51.146 --> 10:53.123
Why lock lips when you
can lock grips, right?

10:53.148 --> 10:54.483
Mm.

10:54.508 --> 10:56.827
Here's a tape of King's
Head against Bog Harbor.

10:56.852 --> 10:59.485
They've got only one
non-crappy debater,

10:59.537 --> 11:01.694
- Sasha Whiteman.
- TINA: Oh, I know Sasha.

11:01.719 --> 11:03.266
He's tricky and preppy.

11:03.291 --> 11:04.577
Treppy? Pricky?

11:04.602 --> 11:07.155
He'll have to be tricky
'cause the rest are stiffs.

11:07.180 --> 11:08.929
This guy gets stress hiccups.

11:08.954 --> 11:10.880
This girl's braces lock up.

11:10.916 --> 11:13.437
This Duncan guy is from New Zealand,
and no one can understand him.

11:13.462 --> 11:16.226
Rebuttal, yeah. Where I'm
from we call it buttle rubbies.

11:16.251 --> 11:19.250
Whoa. Uh, could-could we,
uh, roll back to Duncan?

11:19.275 --> 11:21.031
- DUNCAN: Buttle rubbies.
- And roll back again.

11:21.056 --> 11:22.383
- I don't get it.
- Buttle rubbies.

11:22.407 --> 11:23.148
And again.

11:23.173 --> 11:24.206
- Buttle rubbies.
- Uh, why are we doing this?

11:24.231 --> 11:25.288
- Uh, and one more time.
- Last time.

11:25.313 --> 11:26.211
- Buttle rubbies.
- And again.

11:26.236 --> 11:27.086
- What?
- Buttle rubbies.

11:27.111 --> 11:28.672
- Can you zoom?
- I can't zoom.

11:28.697 --> 11:30.828
- Zoom and enhance.
- Enhance doesn't exist.

11:30.853 --> 11:32.570
- Uh, and freeze frame.
- All right, Tina.

11:32.595 --> 11:35.345
Come on, let's start
debate prepping, girlfriend.

11:35.370 --> 11:36.703
What?! Oh, right.

11:36.728 --> 11:38.001
(chuckles) We're dating.

11:39.703 --> 11:41.152
It all came rushing back.

11:41.177 --> 11:42.928
I'm just prewired for long-necked boys

11:42.953 --> 11:44.468
with thick accents
and/or speech impediments.

11:44.493 --> 11:47.728
She likes them not quite a
man and hard to understand.

11:47.763 --> 11:50.430
- It stinks.
- I know, sweetie.

11:50.466 --> 11:52.065
No, something actually smells bad.

11:52.101 --> 11:54.251
(sniffs) Ugh. It's Meat Man.

11:54.303 --> 11:56.169
He's not getting any
younger under these lights.

11:56.221 --> 11:57.838
Oh, boy. The meat is turning gray.

11:57.890 --> 11:59.256
Makeup.

11:59.320 --> 12:01.308
- Best I can do.
- (sighs)

12:01.343 --> 12:03.477
I can't break up with Henry
right before the big debate.

12:03.512 --> 12:04.845
It'll kill him and we'll lose,

12:04.897 --> 12:06.263
which will kill him again.

12:06.315 --> 12:08.648
Listen, you're in, you're out. 24 hours.

12:08.684 --> 12:11.184
And then Monday let Henry
down as gently as you can,

12:11.236 --> 12:12.736
like I did with Hugo.

12:12.771 --> 12:15.155
You sang a break-up song
on his answering machine.

12:15.190 --> 12:16.940
It was a rap, Bob.

12:16.992 --> 12:19.276
Tina, honey, just keep
your head in the game,

12:19.328 --> 12:20.744
and don't even look at this Duncan boy.

12:20.779 --> 12:22.195
Avoid. Avoid.

12:22.247 --> 12:25.282
Got it. Avoid mixing with Duncan.

12:26.071 --> 12:27.784
Okay, guys, mix it up.

12:27.836 --> 12:30.203
What do you say we go over
there and get in their faces?

12:30.255 --> 12:32.672
You know, intimidate
them in a polite way.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.090
Great idea, Habes.

12:34.126 --> 12:36.676
Really get in their
faces, like an inch away.

12:36.712 --> 12:38.962
I'm drinking wine. I'm
off school property.

12:39.014 --> 12:41.014
(laughs) Or-Or, rejoinder,

12:41.049 --> 12:42.966
we keep our distance and ignore them.

12:43.018 --> 12:44.417
That always chaps my hide.

12:44.442 --> 12:46.219
Tina Belcher.

12:46.271 --> 12:48.104
I heard that voice, and I knew it either

12:48.140 --> 12:51.212
had to be Tina Belcher or
the saddest bird in the world.

12:51.237 --> 12:53.894
- Hi, Sasha. Hello.
- Hi.

12:53.946 --> 12:55.812
(whispering): Closer. Intimidate.

12:55.864 --> 12:58.482
Uh... Tina, you seem
to have noticed Duncan,

12:58.534 --> 13:00.534
our exchange student from somewhere.

13:00.569 --> 13:01.735
- New Zealand.
- Right.

13:01.787 --> 13:03.203
It's so far away that Duncan

13:03.238 --> 13:04.788
went through puberty on the plane.

13:04.823 --> 13:07.407
It's true. I got pit
scrubbies and other scrubbies,

13:07.459 --> 13:08.575
a couple of chesties.

13:08.627 --> 13:09.826
Oh, a new one. Want one?

13:09.878 --> 13:11.411
Um, one of your chesties?

13:11.463 --> 13:12.629
Yeah. They just twist off.

13:12.664 --> 13:13.880
Want me to twist you off a chestie?

13:13.916 --> 13:16.249
Yes? I-I mean no. No. No.

13:16.301 --> 13:17.751
- Sasha, you want one?
- Yeah, I'll take one.

13:17.803 --> 13:20.003
No worries, here you
go. That's my best one.

13:20.028 --> 13:22.282
No worries. That's what you say
when there aren't worries, right?

13:22.307 --> 13:24.424
But-But when there are worries,
what do you say, "Worries"?

13:24.476 --> 13:25.642
(laughs nervously) Duncan.

13:25.677 --> 13:27.928
Uh, King's Head huddle.

13:27.980 --> 13:31.765
Tina is super freaky for
Duncan. I'm calling an audible.

13:31.817 --> 13:34.518
Duncan, you'll be my number two
tomorrow against Henry and Tina.

13:34.570 --> 13:35.769
Brenda, you're benched.

13:35.821 --> 13:37.437
- But...
- Brenda, shush.

13:37.489 --> 13:40.357
- We're going with the debate candy.
- I'm not a good debater.

13:40.409 --> 13:42.409
Just be you. And if
you can figure out a way

13:42.444 --> 13:44.289
to take off your shirt
during the debate, do it.

13:44.314 --> 13:45.445
Just use my arms, right?

13:45.497 --> 13:47.330
Fun mixer. I-I'm gonna
go prep for the debate.

13:47.366 --> 13:49.783
You know, I think
Duncan's gonna body surf

13:49.835 --> 13:52.285
right outside the hotel
windows to clear his brain.

13:52.337 --> 13:54.254
Oh, I'll go get my togs on then.

13:54.289 --> 13:55.422
You probably call them swimmies.

13:55.457 --> 13:57.123
I don't care. Bye.

13:58.844 --> 14:00.210
DUNCAN: That wave was a dumper.

14:00.262 --> 14:01.545
I almost lost my togs.

14:01.597 --> 14:05.382
- You could nearly see my bum.
- (nervous grunting)

14:05.434 --> 14:07.539
- (phone rings)
- Hello?

14:07.564 --> 14:09.269
Tina, the sunset is gorgeous down here.

14:09.304 --> 14:10.804
You need help toweling off, Dunc?

14:10.856 --> 14:13.640
Is no one gonna help
Duncan towel off? Really?

14:13.692 --> 14:16.059
It's so simple. He's wet, make him dry.

14:16.111 --> 14:17.394
I know what you're doing, Sasha.

14:17.446 --> 14:18.478
You're not gonna get
me down to the beach.

14:18.530 --> 14:20.564
(phone rings)

14:20.616 --> 14:21.715
SASHA: Just calling you back real quick

14:21.750 --> 14:23.350
to let you know that Duncan

14:23.385 --> 14:25.252
is being so self-deprecatingly
charming right now.

14:25.287 --> 14:27.520
He's the center of attention,
but also a little bit alone.

14:27.556 --> 14:29.222
No one gets him.

14:29.258 --> 14:31.364
- There.
- (alarm ringing)

14:31.389 --> 14:33.493
Oh, no, someone pulled the fire alarm.

14:33.545 --> 14:36.061
Everybody down to the beautiful beach.

14:37.608 --> 14:38.944
Whoops. All better.

14:38.969 --> 14:40.085
Whoops. All better.

14:40.110 --> 14:41.943
Whoops. All better. Whoops.

14:41.968 --> 14:43.685
Oh, my God. Meat man's a mess.

14:43.710 --> 14:46.448
Yeah, I don't think the love
scene's believable anymore.

14:46.484 --> 14:48.067
Lorna wouldn't kiss that old meat.

14:48.119 --> 14:49.735
Oh, it's a little late in the day

14:49.787 --> 14:51.928
to start talking about
things Lorna wouldn't do.

14:51.953 --> 14:54.573
Look, I'll kick in another
ten pounds of hamburger

14:54.625 --> 14:55.791
for a new meat man.

14:55.826 --> 14:56.944
You mean recast?

14:56.969 --> 14:58.794
But he's been with us
since the beginning.

14:58.829 --> 15:00.155
He knows the part.

15:00.180 --> 15:01.429
He's just a piece of meat.

15:01.454 --> 15:03.421
"Just a piece of meat"? Wow.

15:03.446 --> 15:04.696
That's kind of rough, Linda.

15:04.721 --> 15:06.087
Yeah, you should hear yourself.

15:06.112 --> 15:08.362
Okay. Sorry. Sorry, Meat Man.

15:08.387 --> 15:10.187
(in deep voice): That's okay.

15:10.508 --> 15:13.225
False alarm, everybody can go back in.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.701
Probably a prank, a super-cool prank.

15:15.726 --> 15:18.564
I'm going in. I-I got to
go find an extension cord

15:18.599 --> 15:20.099
for my sleep apnea machine.

15:20.151 --> 15:21.400
- Yeah, I'm gonna go in, too... oh!
- Oh!

15:21.435 --> 15:23.485
SASHA: Oh, look at that.
You guys bumped into each other.

15:23.521 --> 15:24.653
I'm gonna go inside, bye.

15:24.688 --> 15:27.022
Oh, hi. Didn't see you there.

15:27.074 --> 15:28.384
A crab bit me on my clacker.

15:28.415 --> 15:30.352
Um. That's nice.

15:30.377 --> 15:31.977
Just taking in the view.

15:32.032 --> 15:34.199
The lights look pretty
on the water, huh?

15:34.224 --> 15:36.058
Yeah. You know, in New Zealand,

15:36.083 --> 15:37.449
we don't say, "Turn off the light,"

15:37.501 --> 15:39.034
we say, "Turn on the dark."

15:39.086 --> 15:40.502
Son of a bitch.

15:40.538 --> 15:41.753
Mwah.

15:41.789 --> 15:42.955
Oh! I got to go.

15:43.007 --> 15:44.506
Wait, wait, I got to check something.

15:44.542 --> 15:45.507
Mwah.

15:45.543 --> 15:46.758
Uh, yeah, I was right.

15:46.794 --> 15:47.843
(nervous grunting)

15:47.878 --> 15:50.153
Uh, no worries. No. Worries.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.496
HENRY: Did you do those
tongue exercises last night?

15:56.521 --> 15:57.996
What, no. It was just a little peck.

15:58.021 --> 15:59.554
Oh, uh, yeah, yeah.

15:59.579 --> 16:00.979
(chuckles) All limber.

16:01.004 --> 16:02.887
LINDA: Oh, my God, now we got flies.

16:02.912 --> 16:04.161
It's disgusting.

16:04.186 --> 16:05.219
Shoo. Shoo.

16:05.239 --> 16:06.762
Oh, I-I think I swallowed one.

16:06.802 --> 16:09.052
(coughs) It's flying back up. (coughs)

16:09.088 --> 16:10.554
Louise, we've got to wrap this up.

16:10.589 --> 16:12.473
I know, I know. I've
got a new ending, okay?

16:12.508 --> 16:14.675
Instead of the last 15 sequences,

16:14.727 --> 16:16.393
we just blow Meat Man up

16:16.428 --> 16:18.145
with a bunch of firecrackers
I got from Teddy.

16:18.180 --> 16:20.314
Bang! Fade out, roll credits.

16:20.349 --> 16:22.015
The whole time he's been
looking for the bomb,

16:22.067 --> 16:23.517
and it's in his butt!

16:23.569 --> 16:25.569
That's crazy. The meat
would go everywhere.

16:25.604 --> 16:27.521
And Teddy, you shouldn't
give my kids fireworks.

16:27.573 --> 16:30.190
Bob, on the set I like
to be the solution guy,

16:30.242 --> 16:32.442
not the here's-why-we-can't guy.

16:32.495 --> 16:34.995
But there is something
kind of perfect about it.

16:35.030 --> 16:38.017
- I say we do it.
- And I say you don't.

16:38.951 --> 16:39.950
Hugo?

16:40.002 --> 16:41.835
- And Ron.
- And Ron. Sorry, Ron.

16:41.871 --> 16:44.371
When I arrived for a
surprise health inspection,

16:44.423 --> 16:47.007
I expected to find beaucoup violations,

16:47.042 --> 16:49.042
but not you people about to explode

16:49.094 --> 16:50.928
rotted meat all over the restaurant.

16:50.963 --> 16:52.903
But we need an end for our movie.

16:52.928 --> 16:55.098
Well, I could care... movie?

16:55.134 --> 16:57.351
Should a robot be president?

16:57.386 --> 17:00.771
Tina Belcher of Wagstaff
will give the First Negative.

17:00.806 --> 17:03.974
(microphone whines)

17:04.037 --> 17:09.290
(clears throat) No, we should not
have a robot president be-kiss...

17:09.315 --> 17:14.044
I-I-I mean because it wouldn't
be smooch, I mean smart.

17:14.069 --> 17:17.037
In the words of President
Abraham Duncan...

17:17.071 --> 17:18.872
I-I-I mean Duncan Lincoln.

17:18.907 --> 17:20.748
I mean, damn it, I-I-I
kissed Duncan last night.

17:20.772 --> 17:23.042
- (audience gasps)
- Oh, no, it can't be.

17:23.078 --> 17:24.294
Oh, yeah. Right.

17:24.329 --> 17:25.453
I'm sorry, Henry.

17:25.478 --> 17:29.299
You're using our First Negative
to tell me you kissed Duncan?

17:29.335 --> 17:31.168
And to break up with you.

17:31.220 --> 17:32.419
(in high-pitched voice):
And to break up with me?

17:32.471 --> 17:33.887
Oh. We're dead.

17:33.923 --> 17:35.339
We are dead.

17:35.391 --> 17:37.724
I guess you can debate
what you don't believe,

17:37.760 --> 17:39.927
but you can't date
what you don't believe.

17:39.979 --> 17:42.429
- Anyway, robot president, um...
- (bell dings)

17:42.481 --> 17:43.647
Oh, out of time.

17:43.682 --> 17:45.398
I like kissing, you know?

17:45.423 --> 17:46.789
I'm always keen for a kiss.

17:46.814 --> 17:48.329
Should I talk about the robot?

17:48.354 --> 17:51.438
A robot prezzy could turn into a plane.

17:51.490 --> 17:52.773
No need for Air Force One, then.

17:52.825 --> 17:54.608
- He is Air Force One.
- (bell dings)

17:54.660 --> 17:57.828
You know how long it'll take
me to find another girlfriend?

17:57.863 --> 18:01.520
(crying)

18:02.451 --> 18:03.867
HUGO: Okay, how about this?

18:03.919 --> 18:07.087
Instead of blowing up,
Meat Man just drives away,

18:07.122 --> 18:09.790
and everyone knows that's the
last they'll ever see of him.

18:09.842 --> 18:11.258
That's a terrible ending.

18:11.293 --> 18:12.843
It's how the movie Drive ended.

18:12.878 --> 18:14.461
- Ron cried.
- I did.

18:14.513 --> 18:17.130
No, no, the only ending
that makes any sense

18:17.182 --> 18:18.298
is the explosion.

18:18.350 --> 18:19.883
You-You die how you live.

18:19.935 --> 18:21.551
Scarface, Easy Rider,

18:21.604 --> 18:22.686
Butch and Sundance.

18:22.721 --> 18:23.720
Curious George.

18:23.772 --> 18:25.939
He was a little too curious.

18:25.975 --> 18:28.191
Okay, fine, but you
deep clean afterwards,

18:28.227 --> 18:30.143
and I get grateful
acknowledgment in the credits,

18:30.195 --> 18:31.311
plus a swag bag.

18:31.363 --> 18:32.646
We're doing it, we're doing it.

18:32.698 --> 18:34.064
Explode that sweet meat.

18:34.116 --> 18:35.782
Anybody else with a phone, get it out.

18:35.818 --> 18:37.451
We want multiple angles.

18:37.486 --> 18:38.652
Okay, Teddy, cue firecrackers.

18:38.704 --> 18:39.653
Roger.

18:39.705 --> 18:41.788
We do this shot once, people.

18:41.824 --> 18:43.123
Roll camera!

18:52.156 --> 18:54.251
Maybe a mistake.

18:54.303 --> 18:56.470
I've got old meat
inside my headphone jack.

18:56.505 --> 18:57.504
Worth it!

18:57.556 --> 19:00.173
Should a robot be president?

19:00.225 --> 19:02.509
Head or heart? Logic or emotion?

19:02.561 --> 19:04.144
Take a look at the Wagstaff team

19:04.179 --> 19:05.595
to see what emotions
get you. (shuddering)

19:05.648 --> 19:07.648
Let's keep emotions where they belong,

19:07.683 --> 19:09.933
in off-Broadway shows
that my uncle finances.

19:09.985 --> 19:12.943
Robots have no emotions;
they'll keep us safe.

19:12.968 --> 19:14.604
Should a robot be president?

19:14.657 --> 19:15.822
Hell yes.

19:15.858 --> 19:17.491
- Hell yes!
- (bell dings)

19:17.526 --> 19:18.775
I nailed it, we're gonna win.

19:18.827 --> 19:21.578
Rejoinder, Tina Belcher, Wagstaff.

19:21.613 --> 19:22.708
(whines)

19:22.733 --> 19:24.915
Henry, I know I wasted
valuable debate minutes

19:24.950 --> 19:26.199
breaking up with you,

19:26.251 --> 19:27.784
but you're still my debate partner,

19:27.836 --> 19:29.740
and I think maybe we can win this thing.

19:31.083 --> 19:33.707
Let's talk about so-called logic.

19:33.759 --> 19:36.343
I started dating Henry
because it seemed logical

19:36.378 --> 19:38.762
to try a reliable, but
not-remotely-my-type guy.

19:38.797 --> 19:40.187
- (groans)
- Sorry, Henry.

19:40.212 --> 19:42.461
But it was the wrong decision.

19:42.486 --> 19:44.184
I was using my head to do something

19:44.219 --> 19:45.936
that it couldn't handle by itself.

19:45.971 --> 19:49.022
The brain needs the heart
and the heart needs the brain.

19:49.058 --> 19:51.108
I want a president
with both those things,

19:51.143 --> 19:52.726
with feelings, and lips

19:52.778 --> 19:54.811
and a butt and boobs if it's a woman.

19:54.863 --> 19:56.279
- Humans for president.
- (bell dings)

19:56.770 --> 19:58.315
Oh, crap.

19:58.367 --> 20:00.484
She's still amazing.

20:00.536 --> 20:01.568
(mutters incoherently)

20:01.620 --> 20:03.403
Winner, Wagstaff.

20:03.455 --> 20:04.738
Oh, my God, we won!

20:04.790 --> 20:05.789
That's us, right?

20:05.824 --> 20:06.957
Aren't we the Waggies?

20:06.992 --> 20:08.208
When do you go back to New Zealand?

20:08.243 --> 20:09.743
I live here now. I've moved here.

20:09.795 --> 20:12.045
- Well, you're not welcome.
- Aw, that's not right.

20:12.081 --> 20:14.047
- Sorry about everything, Henry.
- It's okay.

20:14.083 --> 20:16.083
You made some good points up there.

20:16.135 --> 20:18.885
And I didn't even think I'd
go on a date until grad school,

20:18.921 --> 20:21.421
so I'm way ahead,
according to Haber-metrics.

20:21.473 --> 20:22.723
There's someone out there for you.

20:22.758 --> 20:24.174
And that's not up for debate.

20:24.226 --> 20:26.676
(sighs) Great summation.

20:26.729 --> 20:28.345
LINDA: Watch out, Meat Man.

20:28.397 --> 20:29.513
It might be a trap!

20:29.565 --> 20:31.815
LOUISE: Don't worry, we'll meat again...

20:31.850 --> 20:34.684
- So you broke up with poor Henry, huh?
- Yeah.

20:34.737 --> 20:37.187
I guess you just can't
talk yourself into love.

20:37.239 --> 20:38.772
I can talk myself into anything.

20:38.824 --> 20:40.190
I like salad now!

20:40.242 --> 20:41.858
Here comes the boffo ending, Dad.

20:41.910 --> 20:44.494
- (sniffles): It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

20:44.530 --> 20:47.531
Aw, Bob. You identify with Meat Man.

20:47.583 --> 20:49.557
(sniffs) I just think
it's a good movie, Lin.

20:49.605 --> 20:51.572
Everybody does. It's the best movie.

20:51.607 --> 20:53.440
Uh, Mom, you have old meat in your ear.

20:53.476 --> 20:55.342
That's collectible. Save it.
