10:06.004 --> 10:07.136
there isn't much
to unlock in there.

10:07.179 --> 10:08.659
I can hear your thoughts!

10:08.703 --> 10:10.400
Uh, I mean, hey,
I was just joking around,

10:10.443 --> 10:11.880
privately, in-in my head.

10:11.923 --> 10:14.143
I have to figure out
the right harmonic frequency

10:14.186 --> 10:15.710
that will disrupt
his power cycle.

10:15.753 --> 10:18.582
-[grunting]
-[whooshing]

10:21.411 --> 10:23.108
-[coughing]
-[groaning]

10:27.896 --> 10:29.332
What is he doing now?

10:29.375 --> 10:30.942
[groaning]
It's easy to become a god.

10:30.986 --> 10:33.031
The trick is staying a god.

10:33.075 --> 10:35.686
He seems to be focusing
on his bi's and tri's.

10:35.730 --> 10:37.688
Captain, we have
an incoming communication

10:37.732 --> 10:38.994
from Admiral Freeman.

10:39.037 --> 10:40.778
I'll take it in my ready room.

10:41.605 --> 10:43.825
Hey, sweetheart.
Just checking in on the mission.

10:43.868 --> 10:46.175
Oh, sorry. Did I catch you
in the middle of something?

10:46.218 --> 10:49.352
Nah. Just having lunch--
some hot chili. [laughs]

10:49.395 --> 10:50.788
No, the mission is great.

10:50.832 --> 10:52.485
Second contact
is almost complete.

10:52.529 --> 10:54.444
You know, Carol Bear, you
impressed some important people

10:54.487 --> 10:56.446
with your showdown
with the Pakleds.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.535
This could be your year to get
promoted to a capital ship--

10:58.578 --> 11:00.232
as long as you keep
a clean record, of course.

11:00.276 --> 11:01.712
[chuckling]:
Oh, the Cerritos?

11:01.756 --> 11:05.107
Oh, it's the very image
of Starfleet responsibility.

11:05.150 --> 11:07.587
Mariner,
get Ransom under control

11:07.631 --> 11:09.851
and get that number picked now!

11:09.894 --> 11:11.548
Yelling at me
isn't going to help!

11:11.591 --> 11:13.898
Oh, yeah. Feel the burn!

11:15.334 --> 11:17.728
So, wait. My brain's gonna melt
out of my nose

11:17.772 --> 11:19.077
because I like pears?

11:19.121 --> 11:20.644
No, no, no, no, no.

11:20.688 --> 11:22.124
There's a problem in the way
that your hippocampus

11:22.167 --> 11:23.865
and your implant
are communicating.

11:23.908 --> 11:25.562
Okay, so what's
with all the disks?

11:25.605 --> 11:26.868
They provide a low-level shock.

11:26.911 --> 11:28.652
A shock? There's, like,
a hundred of 'em!

11:28.696 --> 11:31.089
Reacting to pain can often kick
neurons right back into place.

11:31.133 --> 11:33.091
Wait. How much pain? Aah!

11:33.135 --> 11:34.876
That kind of hurt!
Can you warn me next time?

11:34.919 --> 11:36.312
Uh, sorry, I can't.

11:36.355 --> 11:37.748
The shocks have to come
at unexpected times.

11:37.792 --> 11:39.445
-I can't tell you when I'm...
-[yells]

11:39.489 --> 11:40.708
That one was worse!

11:40.751 --> 11:41.752
I have to randomize
the voltage,

11:41.796 --> 11:42.753
or your brain will tune it out.

11:42.797 --> 11:43.885
[groaning]

11:43.928 --> 11:45.625
Do you still like pears?

11:45.669 --> 11:47.062
Yes! [yells]

11:47.105 --> 11:49.020
[sighs, groans]

11:49.064 --> 11:50.543
[groans]
Huh?

11:50.587 --> 11:51.849
How about now?

11:51.893 --> 11:53.242
Uh, pears? No, I hate pears.

11:53.285 --> 11:54.765
I'll never eat a pear again.

11:54.809 --> 11:56.114
Then you should
pass this test.

11:56.158 --> 11:58.203
Three sets of twins are lost
at sea.

11:58.247 --> 12:00.249
Each set shares a parent
with the other,

12:00.292 --> 12:02.033
but no two sets are the same.

12:02.077 --> 12:04.819
What is the name of the boat?

12:04.862 --> 12:08.605
Uh, um... The Salty Dog?

12:08.648 --> 12:09.911
-Yes!
-Really?

12:09.954 --> 12:11.913
-No.
-[yelling]

12:11.956 --> 12:13.784
No, what are you doing?
No, don't do that!

12:13.828 --> 12:15.351
-I'm late for my date.
-But your brain!

12:15.394 --> 12:17.396
Was feeling great
until you started shocking me.

12:17.440 --> 12:19.137
This isn't like you!

12:19.181 --> 12:23.185
Looks like I'm going to have to
resort to more extreme methods.

12:25.709 --> 12:28.059
[people whimpering]

12:28.103 --> 12:29.757
[buzzing, crackling]

12:29.800 --> 12:32.020
That displeases Ransom.

12:33.195 --> 12:35.110
He made the moon disappear.

12:35.153 --> 12:36.502
Hey, buddy, look at...
look at this.

12:36.546 --> 12:38.113
-[all gasp]
-This... this might be

12:38.156 --> 12:39.854
the best subspace number
I've even seen.

12:39.897 --> 12:41.159
[grunts]

12:42.465 --> 12:45.381
He just ruined our museum
of popular music!

12:45.424 --> 12:47.470
Hey, that sounds
like something you don't need.

12:47.513 --> 12:49.820
Mom, I don't think
this is going to happen.

12:49.864 --> 12:51.474
[groans]
Well, it has to!

12:51.517 --> 12:54.433
I never should have authorized
you to break mission parameters.

12:54.477 --> 12:55.957
Well, how was I supposed to know
this was all gonna go

12:56.000 --> 12:57.262
all Ransom on the mount?

12:57.306 --> 13:00.613
I will create a race
of Ransomites!

13:00.657 --> 13:02.180
[gasping]

13:04.182 --> 13:06.619
Hey, don't transform
my constituents!

13:06.663 --> 13:08.143
Ooh, ooh, do me, sir!

13:08.186 --> 13:10.058
[bleep] it. I'm gonna blast him.

13:10.101 --> 13:12.103
FREEMAN: No! Shooting
from the hip is what

13:12.147 --> 13:13.844
landed us here
in the first place.

13:13.888 --> 13:15.324
Just calm him down.

13:15.367 --> 13:17.674
Mom, I feel that you are not
listening to me.

13:17.717 --> 13:19.502
I amgoing to calm him down...
by blasting him.

13:19.545 --> 13:22.157
When you say that,
what I hear is

13:22.200 --> 13:25.029
that you don't like
being disagreed with.

13:27.510 --> 13:28.859
[gasps]

13:28.903 --> 13:31.166
Ah!

13:32.558 --> 13:34.256
Ah, damn it!

13:36.258 --> 13:37.607
FREEMAN:
We have to be a team on this.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.522
Yeah, no. Of course,
yeah, love to be a team.

13:39.565 --> 13:41.611
Stop pretending
to like each other.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.353
It's making me furious!

13:44.396 --> 13:47.008
I am superior to all of you!

13:47.051 --> 13:49.401
Oh, it's true.
All hail Ransom.

13:49.445 --> 13:51.751
I bow.
I bow before thee, sir.

13:51.795 --> 13:54.798
Emergency transport to sickbay
for Commander Ransom now.

-[gasping]

13:57.714 --> 13:59.368
Dude, not cool!

13:59.411 --> 14:01.152
FREEMAN: Doc, how did they deal
with Gary Mitchell?

14:01.196 --> 14:02.893
Kirk smooshed him
with a boulder.

14:02.937 --> 14:06.027
Gary Mitchell was an ant,
and I am a lion!

14:06.070 --> 14:08.029

14:08.072 --> 14:11.423

14:13.295 --> 14:14.774
RUTHERFORD:
You know what?

14:14.818 --> 14:16.689
Maybe we shouldn't be
seeing each other tonight.

14:16.733 --> 14:19.083
My memory's all messed up
because of my new implant.

14:19.127 --> 14:20.693
Sorry if I say anything weird.

14:20.737 --> 14:22.173
Don't worry. I'm used to it.

14:22.217 --> 14:23.914
My older sister got a symbiont,

14:23.958 --> 14:25.568
and it totally
changed her personality.

14:25.611 --> 14:27.352
Oh, is it because she has all
the memories and experiences

14:27.396 --> 14:29.050
-of her past lives in her head?
-Meh.

14:29.093 --> 14:31.922
It's more that she always has
to bring up having a symbiont.

14:31.966 --> 14:33.402
It's like, we get it.

14:33.445 --> 14:35.752
-[both laugh]
-When are you back on duty?

14:35.795 --> 14:37.928
Me and a couple girls from
cetacean ops are going swimming.

14:37.972 --> 14:39.234
Want to join?

14:39.277 --> 14:40.975
Sure. This thing is waterproof.

14:41.018 --> 14:42.846
-I can swim all night.
-Great.

14:42.890 --> 14:45.022
Uh, I think your friend
is gonna shoot you.

14:45.066 --> 14:47.459
What now? [gasps]

14:47.503 --> 14:49.418
-Tendi, what are you doing?!
-Sorry to interrupt,

14:49.461 --> 14:51.420
but I really don't want you
to die again!

14:51.463 --> 14:54.118
-Hi. I'm Tendi. We're friends.
-Nice to meet you.

14:54.162 --> 14:55.772
Tendi, come on!
You don't have to do this!

14:55.815 --> 14:58.862
I'm in medical, he has SMD,
I'm just saving his life.

14:58.906 --> 15:00.255
What's an SMD?

15:00.298 --> 15:03.780
It's just a cyborg thing.
I'm fine. Aah! Uh.

15:03.823 --> 15:05.086
Well, when you're cured,

15:05.129 --> 15:06.522
just meet us
outside cetacean ops.

15:06.565 --> 15:08.132
I'm going
to go change into my swimsuit.

15:08.176 --> 15:10.091
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I can come with you!

15:10.134 --> 15:12.093
Oh, no, you can't!

15:12.136 --> 15:13.224
[gasps]
What's in those hyposprays?

15:13.268 --> 15:14.617
Medical venom!

15:14.660 --> 15:15.879
Ugh. Stop!

15:15.923 --> 15:17.272
You can't just
keep attacking me and trying

15:17.315 --> 15:18.621
to surprise me
into getting better.

15:18.664 --> 15:20.928
-If I do have this LSD thing...
-SMD.

15:20.971 --> 15:23.582
Whatever. You can't cure it
like getting rid of hiccups.

15:23.626 --> 15:26.455
-[sighs] You're right.
-Thank you.

15:26.498 --> 15:28.326
I'll have to get your brain
out of your skull

15:28.370 --> 15:30.807
and freeze it so I can nano
suture your dendrites by hand.

15:30.850 --> 15:33.331
Tendi, please! I just want
to go swimming with girls!

15:33.375 --> 15:35.812
-Then give me your brain!
-No!

15:35.855 --> 15:38.380
My will be done!

15:38.423 --> 15:41.774
Behold the first coming
of Ransom!

15:41.818 --> 15:44.125
Captain, there's a giant head
approaching the ship.

15:44.168 --> 15:45.996
Red alert. Evasive action.

15:46.823 --> 15:47.824

15:54.352 --> 15:56.485
Is this gym equipment?

15:56.528 --> 15:59.140
T'ANA: He's creating his own
Jack utopia.

15:59.183 --> 16:02.099
[groaning]

16:02.143 --> 16:05.015
Wait.
If we can't nullify his powers,

16:05.059 --> 16:06.538
we should boost them.

16:06.582 --> 16:08.192
Why the hell would we do that?

16:08.236 --> 16:10.542
There's a chance it could
short out his godliness.

16:10.586 --> 16:12.892
Yeah,
or make him extra vengeful.

16:12.936 --> 16:14.416
Aah!

16:14.459 --> 16:16.026
Oh, what,
you have a better idea?

16:16.070 --> 16:19.334
[groans] Mom, hit that head
with everything you've got.

16:19.377 --> 16:21.292
Doc says it'll overload him.

16:24.252 --> 16:27.690
Oh, yes, feed me your phasers.
I can feel

16:27.733 --> 16:31.259
myself becoming more powerful
than ever before!

16:31.302 --> 16:34.131
More power
just gave him more power!

16:34.175 --> 16:35.915
[sighs]
I have to reason with him.

16:35.959 --> 16:37.439
Open a channel.

16:37.482 --> 16:40.137
Why are you doing this, Jack?
Stand down.

16:40.181 --> 16:43.358
I used to be your number one,
but then Mariner took it all

16:43.401 --> 16:45.708
just because
she's your daughter.

16:45.751 --> 16:48.493
Then from now on,
you can work with us, too.

16:48.537 --> 16:50.452
I don't want to work with her!

Stay away from me. I want
my brain right where it is.

17:00.375 --> 17:01.941
I'm just borrowing it.
I-I'll give it right back.

17:07.295 --> 17:08.731

17:08.774 --> 17:09.906
But we're best friends!

17:09.949 --> 17:11.386
We have to trust each other.

17:11.429 --> 17:13.083
Well, then,
maybe we shouldn't be friends.

I, uh...

He's right.

17:40.241 --> 17:42.417
What? Well, I do...

17:42.460 --> 17:44.027
actually feel
the exact same way.

17:44.071 --> 17:45.594
I hate being your sidekick.

you question me all the time.

something wrong with you.

18:19.236 --> 18:22.152
If you knew I wasn't in danger,
then why were you hunting me?

18:22.196 --> 18:23.849
Well, you changed your opinion
on so many things,

18:23.893 --> 18:25.721
I was worried
that if I didn't do something,

18:25.764 --> 18:28.854
you might decide
you didn't like me anymore, too.

18:28.898 --> 18:31.422
I'm a monster.
I shouldn't be your doctor.

highly invasive
neuro-medical procedures

18:35.861 --> 18:39.082
in order to make sure
I liked you?

18:39.126 --> 18:41.519
Yes. You can hate me.

18:41.563 --> 18:44.131
Computer,
deactivate force field.

18:44.174 --> 18:45.915
Ha! How could I hate you?

18:45.958 --> 18:48.700
Tackling an emotional problem
with scientific experimentation

18:48.744 --> 18:50.354
is exactly
what I would have done.

18:50.398 --> 18:51.834
-Really?
-Yeah.

18:51.877 --> 18:53.444
But you don't have to,
'cause guess what?

18:53.488 --> 18:56.273
No new implant is gonna stop me
from being your friend.

18:56.317 --> 18:58.057
Aw. Thanks, Rutherford.

18:58.101 --> 18:59.624
It's nice to know
no matter what,

18:59.668 --> 19:01.278
we still love science.

19:01.322 --> 19:03.019
And how.

19:03.062 --> 19:04.847
Also, don't date Barnes.

19:06.501 --> 19:09.112
[groans, grunts]

19:10.505 --> 19:12.202
CASEY:
He's growing hands.

19:12.246 --> 19:13.899
Brace for grabbing!

19:13.943 --> 19:15.074
[laughs]

19:15.118 --> 19:16.511
-[all grunt]
-MARINER: Shoot him

19:16.554 --> 19:18.208
with the dang torpedoes already!

19:18.252 --> 19:19.557
And I'm gonna go find a boulder.

19:19.601 --> 19:22.081
-No! Power down weapons.
-But Captain!

19:22.125 --> 19:24.736
I'm not shooting
my friend anymore.

19:24.780 --> 19:26.129
Why not?

19:26.173 --> 19:27.391
Because you're right.

19:27.435 --> 19:29.437
Mariner and I
haven't been honest,

19:29.480 --> 19:30.960
and you got caught
in the middle.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.744
You're a great officer, Jack.

19:32.788 --> 19:34.877
I shouldn't have taken you
for granted.

19:34.920 --> 19:37.401
CASEY: Captain, his power is...
diminishing.

19:37.445 --> 19:40.274
Your validation feels so good.

19:40.317 --> 19:41.579
Tell me more.

19:41.623 --> 19:43.494
I can end this with praise.

19:43.538 --> 19:46.236
Uh, J-Jack,
you're a-a fine commander.

19:46.280 --> 19:47.890
You're in phenomenal shape.

19:47.933 --> 19:50.893
Yes, fine commander.
Yes, so yoked.

19:50.936 --> 19:52.764
Mom, you've got to hit him.
He's a god.

19:52.808 --> 19:54.549
You can't appeal
to his ego forever.

19:54.592 --> 19:56.899
Stand down, Ensign.
I've got this.

19:56.942 --> 20:00.946
Jack, you're an amazing pilot,
a-a brilliant tactician and...

20:00.990 --> 20:03.514
Oh, you're right.
I should be captain!

20:03.558 --> 20:04.863
Yeah, well,
I don't know about that.

20:04.907 --> 20:06.778
-Why not?
-That position is filled.

20:06.822 --> 20:08.780
[chuckles]:
We can't have two captains.

20:08.824 --> 20:11.000
Not two. Just me.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.481
Full stop, mister.
This is myship.

20:13.524 --> 20:15.265
I want to be the captain!

20:15.309 --> 20:17.224
[all grunt]

20:17.267 --> 20:19.226
[shouts]

20:19.269 --> 20:20.488
Wait, Jack, no!

20:20.531 --> 20:21.706
You've got great hair,

20:21.750 --> 20:23.273
and you're so good
at guitar and...

20:23.317 --> 20:24.970
[groans]

20:25.014 --> 20:28.147
What? It worked?
Was it the guitar thing?

20:28.191 --> 20:29.236
Uh...
[grunts]

20:29.279 --> 20:32.369
I'm going to destroy you...
[groans]

20:32.413 --> 20:34.806
[bellows deeply]

20:34.850 --> 20:37.461
What the hell is happening
down there?

20:37.505 --> 20:39.289
-[grunts]
-RANSOM: Ow!

20:39.333 --> 20:42.031
Sorry, Mom. I had to take
matters into my own feet.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.293
-[grunting]
-[Ransom groaning]

20:43.337 --> 20:44.686
[kick lands]

20:48.167 --> 20:49.473
[wheezes]

20:49.517 --> 20:51.301
[retches]

20:51.345 --> 20:52.911
Mariner? What was I doing?

20:52.955 --> 20:54.522
You were trying
to eat the ship, sir.

20:54.565 --> 20:56.785
I had to apply concentrated
force to your neutral zone.

20:56.828 --> 20:58.526
I'm sorry.
Those strange energies

20:58.569 --> 20:59.701
may have given me powers,

20:59.744 --> 21:01.485
but it was my ego
that turned me...

21:01.529 --> 21:03.618
into a monster!
[grunts]

21:03.661 --> 21:05.184
Sorry. Your eyes were glowing.

21:05.228 --> 21:06.969
[high-pitched]:
Thank you. I could feel myself

21:07.012 --> 21:10.015
succumbing to the power.
[groans, grunts]

21:10.059 --> 21:11.278
FREEMAN:
Would you stop it, Beckett?

21:11.321 --> 21:12.279
No can do.

21:12.322 --> 21:14.498
[grunting]

21:14.542 --> 21:16.021
[whimpering]

21:16.065 --> 21:17.588
[grunts]

21:17.632 --> 21:19.590
[groans]

21:26.684 --> 21:28.033
Oh!

21:28.077 --> 21:31.123
Here, I picked a number.
Just go.

21:31.167 --> 21:34.213
No!

21:35.302 --> 21:37.521
FREEMAN:
TheCerritos is on its way

21:37.565 --> 21:39.218
to the Bitrus Expanse,

21:39.262 --> 21:41.743
and Commander Ransom
should make a full recovery.

21:41.786 --> 21:43.353
I'm really sorry

21:43.397 --> 21:44.876
about the whole omniscient
murder-god thing, Captain.

21:44.920 --> 21:46.878
Well, you just focus
on getting better.

21:46.922 --> 21:49.707
I need you by my side.

21:50.447 --> 21:51.883
All right, big guy.

21:51.927 --> 21:53.624
Today, I'll be reading you
"Nightingale Woman."

21:53.668 --> 21:55.539
Thanks, little buddy.

21:55.583 --> 21:57.715
Hey, Mom. How's Ransom?

21:57.759 --> 22:00.239
He's fine.
Stevens hasn't left his side.

22:00.283 --> 22:02.024
You know, it was cool

22:02.067 --> 22:04.374
being an unstoppable
mommy-daughter team for a while,

22:04.418 --> 22:06.594
but I think
maybe we work better apart.

22:06.637 --> 22:08.900
Agreed.
I'm proud you're my daughter,

22:08.944 --> 22:12.034
but I can't stand
sharing command with you.

22:12.077 --> 22:13.470
Hey, maybe from now on,

22:13.514 --> 22:15.254
we only do
someside missions together.

22:15.298 --> 22:16.604
I would like that.

22:16.647 --> 22:18.083
[sighs]
There's a team

22:18.127 --> 22:19.737
waiting to take me to the brig,
isn't there?

22:19.781 --> 22:22.392
-Ah, you know me so well.
-[door whooshes open]

22:22.436 --> 22:24.089
Love you, Mom.

22:24.133 --> 22:27.266
Love you, too.
Never disobey me again.

22:27.310 --> 22:29.051
I do what I want!

22:29.878 --> 22:32.097
So, your brains
aren't going to melt?

22:32.141 --> 22:33.577
Nope.
I mean, not from the implant.

22:33.621 --> 22:34.970
But we're in Starfleet,

22:35.013 --> 22:36.363
so who knows
what's gonna happen next week.

22:36.406 --> 22:37.842
We worked together
and managed to revert

22:37.886 --> 22:39.366
one of his synaptic pathways.

22:39.409 --> 22:41.280
-Oh, that's nice. Which one?
-I hate pears again.

22:41.324 --> 22:44.283
They're so mealy and bland.
[bleep] pears.

22:44.327 --> 22:46.285
Well, it seems like
everything's back to normal.

22:46.329 --> 22:48.723
Yeah.
Only thing missing is Boimler.

22:48.766 --> 22:50.377
I do miss the guy,
but I can't blame him.

22:50.420 --> 22:51.943
I mean,
think of all the fun adventures

22:51.987 --> 22:53.423
he's going on working with Riker

22:53.467 --> 22:55.512
on a ship that's way cooler
than the Cerritos.

22:55.556 --> 22:57.166
It's everything he ever wanted.

22:57.209 --> 23:00.430
He's got to be having
the time of his life.

23:00.474 --> 23:01.953
[screams]

23:08.046 --> 23:10.266
-[screams] Shields at 30%!
-Red alert!

23:10.309 --> 23:11.876
I'm starting to think
this jam session's

23:11.920 --> 23:14.009
got too many licks
and not enough comp.

23:14.052 --> 23:16.141
What does that even mean?!

23:16.185 --> 23:18.535
More Pakled battle harpies
just dropped out of warp!

23:18.579 --> 23:19.623
They've got us surrounded!

23:19.667 --> 23:20.668
Someone punch me a way out.

23:20.711 --> 23:21.756
Punching.

23:21.799 --> 23:24.149
I'm taking us into the anomaly.

23:24.193 --> 23:26.978
-Brace for gluonic disruption.
-Gluonic what?!

23:28.763 --> 23:30.199
[screaming]

23:30.242 --> 23:32.854
I love my job!

24:28.736 --> 24:30.389
[man imitates weapons firing]

24:32.348 --> 24:33.349
Chirp.
