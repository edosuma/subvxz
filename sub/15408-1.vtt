02:29.899 --> 02:32.109
You know that orange juice
you have every morning?

02:32.277 --> 02:33.402
You know what's in that?

02:33.820 --> 02:34.862
Corn.

02:35.029 --> 02:37.698
And you know what's in the maple syrup
on your pancakes?

02:37.866 --> 02:39.700
You know what makes it taste so good?

02:39.868 --> 02:42.244
Corn. When you're good
and help with the trash...

02:42.412 --> 02:45.497
...you know what makes the big,
green bags biodegradable?

02:45.665 --> 02:46.790
Do you?

02:46.958 --> 02:48.584
Corn.

02:48.751 --> 02:50.460
Corn starch.

02:50.628 --> 02:53.422
But Daddy's company didn't come up
with that one. DuPont did.

02:58.887 --> 03:01.972
Porsche or Porsche?
I've heard it both ways.

03:02.140 --> 03:05.142
Three years in Germany, I should know.
What's German for "corn"?

03:05.310 --> 03:08.312
The German word I really like is
kugelschreiber. That's "pen."

03:08.479 --> 03:10.606
All those syllables just for "pen."

03:14.652 --> 03:17.988
Archer Daniels Midland.
Most people have never heard of us.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.741
Chances are, they've never
had a meal we're not part of.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.534
Just read the side of the package.

03:22.702 --> 03:25.954
That's us. Now ADM
is taking the dextrose from the corn...

03:26.122 --> 03:29.875
...and turning it into an amino acid
called lysine. It's all very scientific.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.251
If you're a stockholder...

03:31.419 --> 03:34.880
...all that matters is corn goes in one end
and profit comes out the other.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.300
We have the largest lysine plant
in the world. That's where I come in.

03:38.468 --> 03:39.927
- Hey, Kirk.
- Mark.

03:40.094 --> 03:42.596
- When are we gonna hit some balls?
- Anytime.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.891
What do they pay Kirk?
What does a guy like that get?

03:46.059 --> 03:47.768
I bet he gets a hundred grand.

03:47.936 --> 03:51.146
He's just gonna sit behind that desk
and ride it into the future.

03:51.314 --> 03:52.898
Good morgen.

04:01.032 --> 04:02.950
- Morning, Mark.
- Morning.

04:03.117 --> 04:04.826
They have lysine results.

04:20.885 --> 04:22.803
Great.

04:24.681 --> 04:28.433
We adjusted the dextrose levels
again, but the virus keeps showing up.

04:28.601 --> 04:32.854
I thought we had it surrounded this time.
We started a new set of cultures.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.900
We'll get it.
We just have to stay after it.

04:37.068 --> 04:39.611
The things eat sugar
and that's what we're giving them.

04:39.779 --> 04:42.656
A warm place filled with sugar.

04:44.242 --> 04:48.870
The fucking thing is supposed to
produce 113,000 tons annually.

04:49.038 --> 04:50.998
We're not gonna get anywhere
close to that.

04:51.165 --> 04:54.710
We've got over $150 million in
costs over there, guys.

04:54.877 --> 04:56.878
Do the Japanese have these problems?

04:57.046 --> 04:59.423
I don't give a shit about the Japanese.

04:59.590 --> 05:01.550
You've gotta get
the goddamn lysine bugs...

05:01.718 --> 05:04.386
...to eat some dextrose
and shit us out some money.

05:04.554 --> 05:06.221
We're having problems with this virus.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.223
I don't want to hear about the virus.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.225
How much are we losing a month?

05:11.436 --> 05:15.605
We are down like seven million per.

05:15.898 --> 05:18.066
That's not gonna fly much longer.

05:18.234 --> 05:22.404
You want to go in next month, tell my
father we're sucking the hind tit on this?

05:22.572 --> 05:23.905
I sure don't.

05:24.073 --> 05:27.993
We're number 44 on the Fortune 500 list,
Mark.

05:28.161 --> 05:31.747
I don't want this turning us
into number 45.

05:31.914 --> 05:33.248
Fix it.

05:35.084 --> 05:38.754
Feed a chicken corn and it gets sick,
like what happened to the first settlers.

05:38.921 --> 05:41.173
Pellagra disease. Niacin deficiency.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.634
Gave them all sorts of problems:
dermatitis, ataxia, even dementia.

05:44.802 --> 05:48.263
Feed a chicken corn and lysine and
it goes from egg to supermarket fryer...

05:48.431 --> 05:50.349
...in six months instead of eight.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.225
Mark?

05:53.436 --> 05:55.187
Where are you?

05:57.273 --> 05:58.440
Hey, you look great.

05:58.649 --> 06:00.067
Oh.

06:01.819 --> 06:04.571
They got the first wall of the stables
up today. See that?

06:04.739 --> 06:07.115
You know they're doing a new thing
in hydroponics?

06:07.283 --> 06:10.786
They're now feeding lysine
to the jumbo shrimp.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.412
Can you imagine that?

06:12.580 --> 06:15.540
You're a jumbo shrimp
and one day some corn goes floating by.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.918
What do you think about that?

06:18.086 --> 06:19.211
Weird, right?

06:19.379 --> 06:21.296
There's an opening
in the plant in Mexico.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.965
They might need me to go down
and set some stuff up.

06:24.133 --> 06:25.801
What do you think about Mexico?

06:27.011 --> 06:28.595
I thought we were getting horses.

06:30.848 --> 06:32.140
Toro.

06:32.308 --> 06:34.226
That's what Spanish bullfighters say.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.270
But it's also what the Japanese call
the high-end tuna sushi.

06:37.438 --> 06:39.648
Toro. Raw fish.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.651
Who went first on that one?
The guy without the grill.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.278
I've been to Tokio.
They sell little-girl underwear...

06:45.446 --> 06:49.241
...in the vending machines right
on the main drag, the Ginza, or whatever.

06:49.409 --> 06:54.413
Guys in suits buying used girl panties.
How is that okay? That's not okay.

06:55.998 --> 06:56.998
Yeah.

06:57.166 --> 07:00.419
There's a Mr. Nakawara calling
from the Ajinomoto Corporation.

07:00.586 --> 07:03.839
He says you know him
and he needs to speak with you.

07:04.006 --> 07:05.048
Yeah, put him through.

07:05.216 --> 07:09.386
It's the Japanese. There's this guy,
Nakawara. He works at Ajinomoto.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.555
He was here a couple weeks ago.
You met him.

07:11.722 --> 07:14.516
I've been talking to him at work,
but sometimes from home...

07:14.684 --> 07:16.643
...because of the time difference.

07:16.811 --> 07:21.356
Mick, this guy knew everything.
Everything.

07:21.524 --> 07:25.444
He says to me, "Hey, you know that total
nightmare you guys had May, June, July?"

07:25.611 --> 07:27.988
Before I ask him what he's talking about,
he goes:

07:28.156 --> 07:33.660
"Those months when ADM was losing
$7 million a month in the lysine business."

07:33.828 --> 07:35.203
Mick, I couldn't believe it.

07:35.371 --> 07:38.623
He goes on to tell me
that one of our highest-paid employees...

07:38.791 --> 07:43.879
...is actually an employee of Ajinomoto,
who is sabotaging the plant.

07:44.046 --> 07:48.675
They're injecting a virus into the dextrose
and contaminating the whole deal.

07:49.218 --> 07:50.385
That's the problem.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.888
I'm telling you, Mick, it's like Rising Sun.

07:53.055 --> 07:55.557
It's like the Crichton novel.
It's just like that.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.185
I go, "Why are you talking to me?"
Know what he says?

07:58.352 --> 08:00.061
Yeah, I know what he says.

08:01.063 --> 08:02.898
How much does he want?

08:03.774 --> 08:05.150
Ten million dollars.

08:06.402 --> 08:10.739
Ten million, but that gives you
the identity of the saboteur...

08:10.907 --> 08:14.409
...the secret identity, and a new lysine bug
that is immune to the virus.

08:14.577 --> 08:17.329
We have the plant up and running
in three days.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.289
How well do you know this guy?

08:21.542 --> 08:25.212
I met him when he was here. We've
spoken on the phone half a dozen times.

08:25.379 --> 08:26.755
So not very well.

08:27.798 --> 08:31.176
Very well? No, I wouldn't say that.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.971
If you hear from him again,
talk him down on the price.

08:35.139 --> 08:37.599
Find out the least amount of money
he'd settle for.

08:37.767 --> 08:43.395
I mean, if we can get a bug that's resistant
to the virus, this might be worth it.

08:43.563 --> 08:44.773
But keep this secret.

08:44.941 --> 08:48.193
If there is a mole, I don't want him to know
that we're on to him.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.528
Absolutely.

08:53.241 --> 08:55.617
This would be a great Place
for some outlet stores.

08:55.785 --> 08:58.954
People would come from all over
southern Illinois, probably Missouri.

08:59.121 --> 09:01.039
Famous name-brand labels
and appliances...

09:01.207 --> 09:03.833
...at savings
of up to 50 percent every day.

09:04.085 --> 09:06.795
Maybe a food court
with a Mexican place.

09:07.755 --> 09:11.550
The birds eat the bugs, the cars eat
the birds, the rust eats the cars...

09:11.717 --> 09:14.469
- ...and new construction eats the rust.
Corky!

09:14.637 --> 09:17.639
Alexander says there's a bat
in his room.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.396
The FBI?

09:26.482 --> 09:28.608
God, no.

09:28.776 --> 09:32.904
I thought you wanted me to talk him down
on the price. And I was doing it.

09:33.072 --> 09:35.949
We're not gonna sit back
and let the Japanese fuck us sideways.

09:36.117 --> 09:39.828
I don't understand. We weren't gonna
mention it and now he's in on it?

09:39.996 --> 09:43.081
Of course he's in on it.
If there's a mole, it's a security issue.

09:43.249 --> 09:44.749
I'll be sitting in with the FBI.

09:45.209 --> 09:48.003
I already told you everything there is
to tell.

09:48.170 --> 09:49.754
I mean, what is the point?

09:49.922 --> 09:51.756
Mark. Calm down. All right?

09:51.924 --> 09:55.010
We don't like the idea of talking to the FBI
any more than you do.

09:55.177 --> 09:59.681
They're just gonna tape the guy's calls,
ask you a few questions. No big deal.

10:00.391 --> 10:02.058
Questions?

10:04.478 --> 10:05.520
Jesus.

10:06.522 --> 10:07.856
Mark?

10:08.024 --> 10:09.858
The FBI?

10:10.026 --> 10:12.444
Why do you have to talk to the FBI?
It's their plant.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.155
Just... Just let them talk to the FBI.

10:15.698 --> 10:18.241
Babe, I am really uncomfortable
with this.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.493
There are some things
that are going on here.

10:22.079 --> 10:23.913
What does that mean, "things"?

10:24.081 --> 10:28.710
It just...
It means that we have to be careful.

10:28.878 --> 10:33.214
Well, whatever you do, Corky,
no matter what's going on...

10:33.382 --> 10:36.551
...just be honest with them
and tell them the truth, okay?

10:37.094 --> 10:40.680
He said he wanted the money wired...

10:43.267 --> 10:46.728
...into a numbered account
in Switzerland...

10:46.896 --> 10:49.147
...and then also in the Caribbean.

10:52.610 --> 10:58.114
Uh... And when did you last have contact
with him?

10:58.282 --> 11:00.033
Two days ago.

11:01.744 --> 11:04.746
But I think he's getting suspicious.

11:05.414 --> 11:10.669
I've been dragging this thing along.
I think if we don't make a move...

11:10.836 --> 11:13.046
I mean, he could already
have backed down here.

11:14.048 --> 11:17.592
And these calls, they've been coming in
on your home line?

11:20.388 --> 11:24.766
Well, I have an ADM line at my house.
It's a business line.

11:25.976 --> 11:28.937
They've been coming in
on the business line.

11:29.105 --> 11:32.774
Well, I think we should start with...

11:32.942 --> 11:36.069
...putting a recording device
on your phone.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.737
There's a sale at Bachrach's.

11:37.905 --> 11:40.657
They have those Oscar de la Renta ties
that nobody buys.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.826
What are they,
two for one for another week?

11:42.993 --> 11:46.121
Diagonal bands of color hanging
around your neck.

11:46.288 --> 11:48.456
They never put the nice Brioni ties
on sale.

11:48.624 --> 11:50.500
I should just get all my ties in Paris...

11:50.668 --> 11:53.461
...wear them once or twice
and shove them in a duty-free bag.

11:53.629 --> 11:55.755
Nobody gets stopped at customs
for ties.

11:55.923 --> 11:57.716
I can help with that.

11:59.593 --> 12:01.344
So...

12:01.512 --> 12:03.179
...that's it, then.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.515
I can go?

12:06.809 --> 12:09.519
Listen. Why don't...? Ahem.

12:11.147 --> 12:14.149
I'd like to come out tomorrow,
get on that phone.

12:14.316 --> 12:17.152
Great. No problem.

12:18.696 --> 12:21.030
- Thank you for your time.
- Thank you.

12:44.388 --> 12:48.600
You told the truth, Mark.
That's all you can do.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.518
I never even had the chance.

12:53.689 --> 12:55.982
They were watching me the whole time.

12:58.652 --> 13:00.820
Cheviron was in the room.

13:10.831 --> 13:14.709
Mick Andreas gets the vice president
of the United States as his godfather.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.170
He goes to Richard Nixon's house
for Thanksgiving.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.881
It's not like his parents died
in a car accident...

13:20.049 --> 13:22.050
...and he ended up in an orphanage.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.427
Mick's dad wrote a check
to the Nixon campaign.

13:24.595 --> 13:27.055
It wound up in the account
of the Watergate burglars.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.224
Did he admit it? I don't think so.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.684
Besides, ADM probably owns the FBI.

13:31.852 --> 13:34.562
They probably wanted me
to move into Dwayne's old house...

13:34.730 --> 13:37.816
...because they got it wired
like in a Crichton novel.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.901
Marty Allison called.

13:40.069 --> 13:44.739
And Sid Hulse wants to know if you can
have dinner at 7:00 instead of 7:30.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.750
Great earrings, Ginger.

13:55.918 --> 13:58.419
Bet you can see those shining
from space.

13:58.587 --> 14:01.756
Mark got them abroad.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.383
I can't remember where.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.093
Nigeria?

14:05.719 --> 14:07.053
Not funny, Sid.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.429
You're telling me.

14:10.599 --> 14:12.517
So, Sid, you're off tomorrow?

14:13.727 --> 14:14.936
Where to?

14:15.104 --> 14:16.896
West Coast swing.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.024
Gotta get up there.
Kick some Japanese butt.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.653
I'm not gonna see you for weeks?

14:23.821 --> 14:26.364
Maybe longer if I get lost in the Ginza.

14:27.783 --> 14:29.742
Have a great trip, Sid.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.039
Just tell them everything.

14:35.749 --> 14:37.375
We'll leave.

14:38.460 --> 14:41.087
I don't like what this company
is doing to you.

14:41.255 --> 14:44.591
This is a chance
to start somewhere new.

14:44.758 --> 14:47.051
Remember, you said Mexico?

14:47.928 --> 14:53.224
I may tell them at some point. But now,
I gotta toe the company line here.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.226
Mark...

14:55.644 --> 14:58.229
...if you don't tell them, I will.

14:59.773 --> 15:01.566
I can't.

15:02.192 --> 15:04.027
Not now.

15:12.995 --> 15:15.163
Hello. Please.

15:16.665 --> 15:18.958
Agent Shepard, my wife, Ginger.

15:19.126 --> 15:22.170
Ma'am. I know it's late.

15:22.338 --> 15:24.213
I'll be out of your hair in a minute.

15:24.673 --> 15:27.592
Great. Maybe a cup of coffee
for Agent Shepard?

15:28.093 --> 15:29.510
Okay.

15:30.804 --> 15:33.556
Just show me where the line
in question...

15:33.724 --> 15:34.933
It's that one over there.

15:35.100 --> 15:38.186
There should be a TV show about
a guy who calls home and he's there.

15:38.354 --> 15:41.356
He answers, he's talking to himself,
only it's someone else.

15:41.523 --> 15:44.859
He's somehow divided into two
and the second one of him drives away.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.487
The show is about him trying
to find the guy.

15:47.655 --> 15:50.573
I'll give you a call tomorrow.
We can test it out.

15:50.741 --> 15:53.242
Great. Great. Okay.
Thank you for coming by.

15:53.410 --> 15:54.452
- Good night.
- Night.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.204
Good night, Mrs. Whitacre.

15:56.372 --> 15:57.664
Good night.

16:02.294 --> 16:05.380
- Are you gonna say something, or am I?
- Don't.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.093
Brian?

16:11.387 --> 16:13.179
Hey, got a minute?

16:17.601 --> 16:18.935
Um...

16:22.231 --> 16:24.399
Can I talk to you in the car?

16:25.484 --> 16:27.193
Sure.

16:39.498 --> 16:43.710
We could go back inside if you want.

16:43.877 --> 16:46.671
They might have it bugged.
We're safer out here.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.172
Bugged?

16:49.091 --> 16:50.341
What?

16:51.010 --> 16:52.593
Who?

16:53.846 --> 16:55.346
Us?

16:56.265 --> 16:59.142
All right, there's things I know.
If I decide to tell you...

16:59.309 --> 17:00.601
...could I be prosecuted?

17:00.769 --> 17:03.646
I cannot provide you with immunity,
but any information...

17:03.814 --> 17:06.357
...about your involvement
in criminal activity...

17:06.525 --> 17:10.569
...would be discussed in a favorable light
with the U.S. Attorney's office.

17:13.824 --> 17:17.827
Okay. Everything I told you yesterday
about Nakawara was true. Absolutely.

17:18.119 --> 17:22.415
Except one thing. He never called me
on my business line.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.460
Well, why did you tell me that he did?

17:25.627 --> 17:29.547
Before I spoke with you yesterday,
I was coached by the guys at ADM...

17:29.715 --> 17:32.842
...to tell you that he called
on my business line, not my home line.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.052
Why?

17:36.638 --> 17:40.141
What I'm about to tell you,
it involves something very large.

17:40.350 --> 17:44.645
This Nakawara extortion thing is nothing
compared to it, nothing at all.

17:47.733 --> 17:50.985
This involves price fixing
in the lysine business.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.738
- Now...
- Wait, hang on.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.120
Take some notes.

18:03.499 --> 18:06.667
- Okay, go on.
- Price fixing in the lysine business.

18:07.711 --> 18:11.172
I have been in several meetings with
our Japanese and Korean competitors...

18:11.340 --> 18:15.176
...over the last few months, where
the sole purpose was to fix the prices.

18:15.344 --> 18:17.720
ADM made me go to those meetings.

18:17.888 --> 18:19.680
See, that's why they wanted me to lie.

18:19.848 --> 18:22.391
Because the Nakawara calls came in
on my home line...

18:22.559 --> 18:25.520
...but so do the calls from the people
we're fixing prices with.

18:25.687 --> 18:27.355
They don't want you to hear those.

18:27.523 --> 18:30.900
They instructed me to tell you the
Nakawara calls came in on my ADM line.

18:31.068 --> 18:34.570
But I realized that once you guys started
digging around in the records...

18:34.738 --> 18:37.115
...you'd see I have all these calls
to Japan.

18:37.282 --> 18:40.284
Right? That's what scared me.
Nobody's got more calls than me.

18:40.452 --> 18:44.038
So if you figure out the price-fixing thing,
I'd be the fall guy.

18:44.206 --> 18:47.250
Who told you to participate
in these price-fixing talks?

18:52.506 --> 18:55.758
I'm operating under the direction of
Mick and Dwayne Andreas.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.642
He seems like a real good guy.

19:04.810 --> 19:08.187
I hope he doesn't mind me calling
him Brian instead of Agent Shepard.

19:08.355 --> 19:09.772
I might even try Bri out.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.066
This must be very different for him...

19:12.234 --> 19:15.486
...talking to a guy like me instead
of a bank robber or a drug dealer.

19:16.613 --> 19:19.073
I could see us fishing or whatever.

19:19.241 --> 19:23.369
What a good listener.
You don't meet one of those every day.

19:27.291 --> 19:48.728
Morning.

19:48.896 --> 19:50.479
What happened last night?

19:50.647 --> 19:52.940
What do you mean? Nothing.
Well, they put a...

19:53.775 --> 19:56.110
...recorder on the phone.

19:57.446 --> 19:58.821
That's it?

19:58.989 --> 20:00.531
Well, yeah.

20:01.325 --> 20:03.284
He said when Nakawara calls...

20:03.452 --> 20:07.747
...I just flip a switch
and record the conversation.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.084
Yeah?

20:12.502 --> 20:14.420
- Oh. Put her through.
- Make sure you do it.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.297
They have ways of checking up.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.090
Sure thing.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.718
Hi, hon.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.136
What?

20:23.138 --> 20:25.139
Slow down, honey, slow...

20:25.849 --> 20:35.107
What?

20:36.318 --> 20:40.154
A pound of bacon, a peanut
butter sandwich, some vitamins.

20:42.950 --> 20:47.495
Anything that ADM has a hand in,
it's all fixed. That's what he's telling me.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.664
I mean, basically...

20:49.831 --> 20:53.000
I mean, everyone in this country is a victim
of corporate crime...

20:53.210 --> 20:55.336
...by the time they finish breakfast.

20:56.046 --> 20:58.631
You think the automobile
companies can't make a car...

20:58.799 --> 21:00.508
...that gets 100 miles to the gallon?

21:00.676 --> 21:03.386
You think the networks
don't know who'll win the World Series...

21:03.553 --> 21:04.679
...before the season starts?

21:04.846 --> 21:07.515
Paranoid is what people who are trying
to take advantage...

21:07.683 --> 21:10.101
...call you to get you to drop your guard.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.186
I read that in an in-flight magazine.

21:12.604 --> 21:17.692
One potential problem I see moving ahead
with ADM is this guy Cheviron.

21:17.859 --> 21:22.029
He wants to be kept in on the loop
on everything that we're doing.

21:27.744 --> 21:29.537
I want to meet Mark Whitacre.

21:30.372 --> 21:35.167
You said they were only
gonna tap one line. One line.

21:35.335 --> 21:38.379
- They are only monitoring one line.
- That is not true.

21:38.547 --> 21:42.049
That is absolutely not true.
I just got off the phone with my wife.

21:42.217 --> 21:44.885
Some woman named Regina
at the phone company called her...

21:45.053 --> 21:48.264
...and said that both my lines are tapped.
My home phone.

21:48.432 --> 21:51.350
Come on, Mark. The phone company
doesn't call people and say:

21:51.518 --> 21:55.896
"Hello, we just wanted to let you know
that the FBI is tapping your phone lines."

21:56.064 --> 21:58.232
Then why would Regina say that?

21:58.400 --> 22:01.736
She didn't say it. You're saying it.

22:02.529 --> 22:03.571
Call my wife.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.907
- Call Regina.
- Fine. Mark.

22:07.451 --> 22:10.369
I will. All right? I will.

22:10.537 --> 22:12.204
Good.

22:18.086 --> 22:19.420
I don't like wool on skin.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.882
Not even that merino wool they have
at Marshall Field in Chicago.

22:23.050 --> 22:26.093
Ginger likes it because it's formfitting,
but she likes avocados.

22:26.261 --> 22:28.429
And who wants that texture
in their mouth?

22:28.597 --> 22:32.600
Who'd make up someone named Regina?
It's the capital of Saskatchewan.

22:40.150 --> 22:41.525
FBI, Shepard.

22:41.693 --> 22:44.028
Hello, Brian. It's Mark Cheviron at ADM.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.529
Yeah, Mark.

22:45.697 --> 22:49.283
I was talking to you guys a couple
days ago about which of the lines...

22:49.451 --> 22:51.911
...at Mark Whitacre's house
you would be monitoring...

22:52.079 --> 22:55.164
...and we had agreed
it would only be the business line...

22:55.332 --> 22:57.917
...so that's all you did, right?

22:58.627 --> 23:01.045
I really can't answer that.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.131
Uh... Okay.

23:04.299 --> 23:05.841
Thank you.

23:17.479 --> 23:22.024
We have decided we will no longer be
cooperating with any further FBI requests.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.110
I knew it. I knew it.

23:24.277 --> 23:28.280
I told you and you wouldn't listen.
You said, "Just the office line, Mark."

23:29.491 --> 23:31.283
Evidently, they were lying to us too.

23:31.451 --> 23:35.079
Well, evidently, you can't keep track
of what the FBI's doing.

23:37.874 --> 23:38.916
Yeah?

23:39.084 --> 23:41.168
The call you were expecting, Mark?

23:41.545 --> 23:42.962
Well, put him through.

23:43.130 --> 23:45.381
It's a Swedish deal I'm working on.

23:46.341 --> 23:49.510
- Mark Whitacre.
- Hey, Mark, it's Brian Shepard.

23:49.678 --> 23:51.846
I told Shepard we're done working
with him now.

23:52.013 --> 23:54.432
Hi. So good to hear from you.

23:54.599 --> 23:58.227
I want to bring my supervisor by
to meet you.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.146
This weekend be okay?

24:00.313 --> 24:02.189
Well, great.

24:02.357 --> 24:05.526
Well... So Mr. Andreas is in my office
right now.

24:06.570 --> 24:08.279
Okay.
- So I'll talk to you later.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.738
- Okay.
- Good.

24:09.906 --> 24:11.866
What do I do if this Shepard guy calls?

24:12.033 --> 24:14.660
You let me know about it,
and I'll tell my dad.

24:14.828 --> 24:17.371
But you're done talking to them.

24:18.248 --> 24:20.166
Absolutely.

24:23.420 --> 24:26.380
Okay, guys, I'm gonna go over the rules.

24:26.548 --> 24:30.301
There's no running, no pushing,
no horseplay by the pool.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.887
And when you have fished
all the leaves out...

24:33.054 --> 24:36.765
...you go into the garage and get the cover
for the pool.

24:37.559 --> 24:40.352
And I'm gonna go get your dad
when he's done...

24:40.520 --> 24:42.730
...and he's gonna come
and do an inspection.

24:42.898 --> 24:45.191
- What was that, honey?
You already told us this.

24:45.358 --> 24:49.153
Honey, well, I'm going over it again.

24:51.406 --> 24:54.366
Now, what is the scoop with all my phones
being tapped?

24:54.534 --> 24:57.578
The only listening device
was the recorder, Mark.

24:57.746 --> 25:03.083
We had a trap-and-trace device on your
home line, but we can't listen in on that.

25:04.085 --> 25:06.212
However,
the phone company calling your wife...

25:06.379 --> 25:08.589
...and telling her
about our intel gathering...

25:08.757 --> 25:10.925
Well, my face is red on that one.

25:11.092 --> 25:12.635
Shouldn't happen.

25:13.094 --> 25:16.847
- Did you bring the expense reports?
- Yeah. Yeah.

25:17.807 --> 25:22.061
Okay, this is Mexico City, Paris,
Hong Kong, Tokio.

25:22.229 --> 25:25.773
There was a meeting of the Corn Refiners
Association in Florida last week.

25:25.941 --> 25:27.441
Mick and Terry went to that one.

25:27.609 --> 25:30.819
They were doing the regular meeting
during the day, and at night...

25:30.987 --> 25:34.698
...they'd get together with our competitors
and work out how to fix the prices.

25:34.866 --> 25:37.910
Watch. In about six months,
the price of a liter of soda pop...

25:38.078 --> 25:39.954
...is gonna be about 5 cents more.

25:40.121 --> 25:41.747
Well, when's the next meeting?

25:41.915 --> 25:45.125
January. Somewhere in Asia.

25:45.293 --> 25:49.129
Mark, I gotta ask you.
Why are you doing this?

25:49.589 --> 25:52.758
We know you lied about the phone line,
and you're afraid of that.

25:52.926 --> 25:58.138
But now you're telling us all this other stuff
out of the blue. Got to ask you why.

25:59.516 --> 26:02.351
Well, because things are going on
I don't approve of.

26:02.852 --> 26:05.854
Now, I'm a biochemist.
I'm a technical guy.

26:06.022 --> 26:07.982
And they pull me
into the business side...

26:08.149 --> 26:11.819
...and suddenly I find out all these things
are going on that are illegal.

26:11.987 --> 26:15.155
If I want to grow with ADM,
I gotta learn the business side.

26:15.323 --> 26:18.117
And so suddenly, I'm lying.
They're making me lie to people.

26:18.285 --> 26:19.577
I lie to you.

26:19.744 --> 26:21.453
I mean, I feel real bad about that.

26:22.122 --> 26:25.583
You look at yourself as wearing a white
hat and they're wearing black hats?

26:25.750 --> 26:27.501
Absolutely. Something like that.

26:27.919 --> 26:30.713
When I was a kid,
my folks died in an automobile accident.

26:30.880 --> 26:34.842
I was maybe 6 years old and a
wealthy man from Ohio adopted me.

26:35.051 --> 26:38.053
Guy owned amusement parks.
He did very well for himself.

26:38.555 --> 26:42.683
I caught a big break there, real big break.
I went to a good school and all.

26:42.892 --> 26:47.271
Now I adopted two kids of my own.
I'm trying to do the right thing here.

26:48.398 --> 26:49.940
Well, Mark...

26:50.108 --> 26:53.652
...do you think you'd be wiling
to go a few steps further in helping us?

26:55.238 --> 26:56.572
What does that mean?

26:56.740 --> 26:58.407
Would you...

26:59.242 --> 27:00.868
...be willing to wear a wire?

27:01.578 --> 27:04.747
We don't have any other sources
at this time. We...

27:05.415 --> 27:06.582
We need your help.

27:06.875 --> 27:10.711
We'll be there with you
all the way. It won't be easy.

27:10.879 --> 27:14.173
I'll use my beeper to signal you
when it's time to set up a meeting.

27:14.341 --> 27:15.674
When you hear this...

27:16.217 --> 27:17.217
You know. Right?

27:18.595 --> 27:20.095
...you call me.

27:21.890 --> 27:24.350
He's watched closely at work...

27:24.517 --> 27:28.228
...and there's reason to believe
that ADM has bugged his home.

27:28.521 --> 27:33.192
He's under a great deal of pressure.
I mean, you gotta feel for the guy.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.736
He tells us the truth one day...

27:35.904 --> 27:39.406
...and wakes up the next with two lives
instead of one.

27:39.574 --> 27:43.410
Well, the good news is he decided
to wake up and tell the truth.

27:45.955 --> 27:48.165
There are these butterflies
in Central America.

27:48.333 --> 27:51.418
They're blue and orange and yellow
and have poison in their wings.

27:51.586 --> 27:53.712
Just enough poison to stop a bird heart.

27:53.880 --> 27:56.840
But the birds know this somehow,
so they don't eat them.

27:57.008 --> 27:59.635
But there are other ones, butterflies...

27:59.803 --> 28:03.764
...they're orange, blue and yellow too,
but no poison wings.

28:03.932 --> 28:07.434
They're just flying around, looking
dangerous, getting by on their looks.

28:07.936 --> 28:09.144
Hey, Mark.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.939
- Hi, Brian.
- Ready to make the call?

28:19.197 --> 28:22.282
Hey, wait up, dipshit.
- We're gonna do it here?

28:25.787 --> 28:29.623
We can't get a room.
There's problems with that.

28:31.584 --> 28:33.085
Um...

28:34.129 --> 28:37.881
I don't know, it just kind of seems,
you know, awkward.

28:38.049 --> 28:40.300
It's the best I can do right now.

28:42.429 --> 28:43.971
Okay.

28:44.514 --> 28:46.098
Just...

28:47.851 --> 28:51.103
Hold the microphone against
the receiver and I'll hold the recorder.

28:51.271 --> 28:52.312
009...

28:53.690 --> 28:55.816
...454...

28:56.317 --> 28:58.986
...58822.

28:59.154 --> 29:00.404
Thank you.

29:02.365 --> 29:06.160
- No, no, put it on the receiver.
- Mr. Yamamoto, please.

29:06.327 --> 29:08.036
The receiver.

29:08.329 --> 29:11.665
- I have it on the receiver.
- On the receiver, where you hear.

29:14.711 --> 29:16.420
I'm on hold.

29:19.215 --> 29:23.010
Hello, Mr. Yamamoto.
It is Mark Whitacre.

29:23.553 --> 29:25.554
Hi, sir. How are you?

29:27.182 --> 29:30.309
No, I'm doing a lot of traveling this week,
a lot of traveling.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.603
How are sales?

29:33.521 --> 29:36.815
Certainly we need to, in terms of our...

29:36.983 --> 29:38.442
In terms of our big customers...

29:38.610 --> 29:41.862
...we definitely need to be thinking
about a good price, yes?

29:42.030 --> 29:45.365
It's better to maintain a price
of $2.50 in other countries...

29:45.533 --> 29:50.037
...and $1.05 for the United States,
and just like that, there it is: price fixing.

29:50.580 --> 29:53.874
Well, this is great, Mark.
This verifies everything you've been saying.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.417
Yeah.

29:55.585 --> 29:58.212
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Yeah. Absolutely.

29:59.547 --> 30:02.883
I like an indoor pool. Year-round usage.

30:03.092 --> 30:06.720
I like the steam off it in the winter.
Very mysterious, that steam.

30:06.888 --> 30:08.388
Well, Marty...

30:10.016 --> 30:12.935
...when you started work at ADM,
how much money did you want?

30:13.228 --> 30:14.520
I wanted 50 grand.

30:15.563 --> 30:19.817
But I went and told Terry,
"We can't get this guy for less than 75."

30:19.984 --> 30:22.444
- Yeah.
- I got it for you. You were the first I hired.

30:22.612 --> 30:25.739
You've always been really generous
with me. And I appreciate it.

30:25.907 --> 30:27.950
Here's what I want you to do.

30:28.618 --> 30:30.869
I want you to write down a name.

30:32.288 --> 30:35.916
Okay. What's the name?

30:37.293 --> 30:39.753
Nordkron Chemie.

30:40.463 --> 30:44.967
What is that, like,
a Nigerian name or something?

30:45.134 --> 30:48.470
I like my hands. I think they're probably
my favorite part of my body.

30:48.638 --> 30:51.515
I think that can be used to my advantage
in social situations.

30:51.683 --> 30:55.269
If I can get people focused on my hands,
I can get a good result in a meeting.

30:55.436 --> 30:57.104
Eye contact is real important too.

30:57.272 --> 30:59.439
Hey, I'm gonna check messages.

31:08.283 --> 31:10.742
You have one message.

31:14.747 --> 31:16.748
My phone died. I was on with the plant.

31:16.916 --> 31:19.084
Is there a payphone,
a public but kind of...?

31:19.252 --> 31:20.419
- Across the lobby.
- Right.

31:20.587 --> 31:23.338
- Mark, this is important bioproduct stuff.
- I know.

31:23.506 --> 31:24.965
Hi, Dave. How's Holly doing?

31:25.133 --> 31:26.300
She's good.
- Great.

31:26.467 --> 31:27.676
It's the plant.

31:27.844 --> 31:30.345
FBI.
- Brian, it's Mark.

31:30.513 --> 31:33.181
I told you, I'm out of town
on business this week.

31:33.349 --> 31:35.726
The case is getting some attention
from the Bureau.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.644
There's another agent working
with me.

31:37.812 --> 31:39.688
I can't talk right now.
I have a meeting.

31:39.856 --> 31:42.149
I have people waiting for me. Bye.

31:43.359 --> 31:44.985
I'm here, Dave.

31:45.695 --> 31:49.031
Being able to do two things at once
is a big part of success.

31:49.198 --> 31:51.575
I try and do abdominal exercises...
Isometrics.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.243
...even when I'm at a meeting.

31:53.411 --> 31:55.287
Tensing. Holding.

31:55.455 --> 31:56.538
Then releasing.

31:56.831 --> 31:59.708
I'll floss in the shower
while the conditioner is in my hair...

31:59.876 --> 32:01.877
...when you're just supposed
to leave it in.

32:02.045 --> 32:05.130
Those things can really add up
to a significant time savings.

32:05.298 --> 32:06.715
Hey, Kirk.

32:07.342 --> 32:08.634
I'll be heading to Europe...

32:08.801 --> 32:12.638
...and I thought I could just hand deliver
that check for the ABP deal in person.

32:12.805 --> 32:14.348
Remind me. ABP deal?

32:14.557 --> 32:17.684
It's a threonine microbe.
They're making substantial improvements.

32:17.852 --> 32:20.187
We want to get into the market.
That's the invoice.

32:20.355 --> 32:21.480
We'll just overnight it.

32:21.648 --> 32:24.816
I'm gonna see this Thorstensson guy,
so I'll just hand it to him.

32:29.113 --> 32:31.573
The metric system never panned out.
We had rulers...

32:31.741 --> 32:34.201
...with inches on one edge,
centimeters on the other.

32:34.369 --> 32:38.038
I pronounced it "centimeters" instead of
"centimeters" and nobody corrected me.

32:38.206 --> 32:41.416
They let me walk around stupid.
I'm not upset we never crossed over...

32:41.584 --> 32:43.794
...though it's helpful
to know the conversions.

32:43.962 --> 32:46.171
The liter bottle is the thing
that caught on...

32:46.339 --> 32:49.383
...because it's a nicer word,
"liter" than "quart."

32:49.550 --> 32:52.260
Quart.

32:52.929 --> 32:54.680
Mark, it's Marty calling again.

32:56.849 --> 32:58.225
Message deleted.

33:10.071 --> 33:11.697
FBI, Agent Shepard.

33:11.864 --> 33:13.615
Brian, it's Mark.

33:13.908 --> 33:16.243
Look, it's been hard for me
to return a page...

33:16.411 --> 33:18.829
...as I am out of the country
at the moment.

33:19.330 --> 33:22.749
Listen, we need to know if you've had
any further contact with Nakawara.

33:22.917 --> 33:26.086
I told you already
that the guy stopped calling.

33:26.254 --> 33:30.590
Well, what about the price fixing? Have
you been able to make any more tapes?

33:30.758 --> 33:33.719
I think you guys hanging around
has everybody scared straight.

33:33.886 --> 33:36.221
The word is we're doing everything
by the book now.

33:36.389 --> 33:38.932
Mick said it's over. No more price fixing.

33:39.100 --> 33:42.978
What? When did this happen,
this conversation?

33:43.146 --> 33:48.066
Everything has changed. I got lysine
up and running. The virus is gone.

33:48.234 --> 33:51.361
Mick brought me into his office,
he sat me down.

33:51.529 --> 33:54.781
He said, "Whitacre, from now on
we're doing things your way."

33:54.949 --> 33:56.616
Mark.

33:56.784 --> 34:00.287
Look, Mark,
the FBI knows about the crimes.

34:00.455 --> 34:02.956
We're gonna investigate either way.

34:03.124 --> 34:04.958
Either way?
What does "either way" mean?

34:05.126 --> 34:07.044
We really need to get together.

34:07.211 --> 34:10.630
It is a different approach there now.
Iâ€™m telling you, it's all...

34:10.797 --> 34:13.091
Everything's changed.

34:13.259 --> 34:16.762
My plane is boarding. I gotta go.
I gotta go.

34:17.554 --> 34:18.972
Ah!

34:28.565 --> 34:31.318
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, fine.

34:31.485 --> 34:32.819
Kids.

34:36.908 --> 34:39.409
- Where were we?
- We were discussing bonuses.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.496
And we should be discussing Ferraris.

34:45.750 --> 34:49.168
You have Full federhaltertinte
all over your shirt.

34:49.837 --> 34:51.630
Ow.

34:51.839 --> 34:53.799
One of the Japanese guys
told me a story.

34:53.966 --> 34:55.801
This lysine salesman is in a meeting...

34:55.967 --> 34:58.595
...with someone from ConAgra
or some other company.

34:58.763 --> 35:01.139
And the client leans forward and says:

35:01.307 --> 35:05.310
"I have the same tie as you,
only the pattern is reversed."

35:05.728 --> 35:08.939
And then he drops dead,
face down on the table.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.900
Alive and then dead.

35:12.068 --> 35:13.360
Brain aneurysm.

35:14.195 --> 35:17.656
Maybe everyone has a sentence like that,
a little time bomb.

35:17.824 --> 35:21.576
"I have the same tie as you,
only the pattern's reversed."

35:21.744 --> 35:25.789
Dead. The last thing they'll ever say.
Something like...

35:25.957 --> 35:29.209
High-fructose corn syrup.
There it is again.

35:29.377 --> 35:32.462
He said that Andreas called
him into a marketing meeting.

35:32.630 --> 35:34.381
He might be late.

35:34.841 --> 35:37.968
If he doesn't show, the government
ought to charge him for the room.

35:40.888 --> 35:43.014
And here it comes.

35:47.478 --> 35:48.728
Shepard.

35:48.896 --> 35:52.399
I can't come to the hotel tonight.
I'm still at work.

35:52.567 --> 35:54.151
Mark, this is the third time.

35:54.318 --> 35:56.820
I gotta go. I have work to do.

35:57.321 --> 36:01.658
- Mark, you can't keep canceling.
- Look, I can't live two lives.

36:01.826 --> 36:05.412
They just offered me
a $100,000 raise, okay?

36:05.580 --> 36:07.998
I'm not gonna lose my job
because of you guys.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.917
I have a family.
I'm building stables across the road.

36:11.085 --> 36:15.255
- But you told us...
- The price fixing is over. It's over.

36:15.423 --> 36:18.633
Hey, Mick.
I'm getting off the phone now.

36:18.801 --> 36:20.760
Mark, listen to me.

36:20.928 --> 36:24.806
The only logical thing for you to do
is cooperate.

36:25.433 --> 36:26.558
What happens if I don't?

36:26.726 --> 36:30.854
Then somebody else will,
and you'll end up being a defendant.

36:31.022 --> 36:34.691
The tapes don't say anything,
because it's over. Mick said.

36:34.859 --> 36:36.443
We have a whole new policy.

36:36.611 --> 36:41.990
Fine, if that's what he said. Then I want
to hear the tape. We need tapes, Mark.

36:43.367 --> 36:45.619
Okay, I never made any tapes.

36:45.786 --> 36:49.122
I never made any because there's not
gonna be anything on the tapes.

36:49.290 --> 36:51.291
It's over, and they'd just be stupid tapes.

36:51.459 --> 36:52.918
- Mark, come on.
- Look, how...?

36:53.085 --> 36:55.795
You tell me how I can prove it to you,
and I Will.

37:39.298 --> 37:42.259
Mick Andreas and his dad
would never lie for me.

37:42.426 --> 37:44.761
They say we're in it together.
What a joke.

37:44.929 --> 37:47.847
Team-building offsite meetings
at some lake in Wisconsin.

37:48.015 --> 37:50.558
I can't protect these guys
if they're breaking the law.

37:50.726 --> 37:53.436
Hey, I tried.
Anybody could see the choices I had.

37:53.604 --> 37:56.231
I did my best for ADM.
You don't see them here in the chair.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.694
Hey, how'd I do?

38:00.861 --> 38:02.696
Mark, we have some problems.

38:02.863 --> 38:07.409
Wait a minute. I was looking at the thing.
The needle didn't even move.

38:07.576 --> 38:10.870
Mark, you don't know
how to read a polygraph.

38:11.038 --> 38:13.707
Well, first of all,
they're not 100 percent accurate.

38:13.874 --> 38:16.042
Mark, you splattered the walls with ink.

38:16.544 --> 38:20.338
Come on. Extortionists just don't leave
their name and number, then go away.

38:20.506 --> 38:21.881
I know it's tough...

38:22.341 --> 38:25.802
...keeping it all bottled up inside,
keeping it a secret.

38:26.345 --> 38:30.056
But there's only one good choice for you.
That's all there's ever been.

38:30.725 --> 38:33.059
There's something
you're not telling us...

38:33.227 --> 38:39.065
...but the only way to protect yourself
is to be completely honest.

38:46.907 --> 38:48.533
Okay.

38:49.744 --> 38:51.244
Okay.

38:54.832 --> 38:56.750
You realize...

38:58.461 --> 39:01.338
...that this can all be used against you
in a court of law.

39:01.505 --> 39:04.591
I'll have to write it all up,
and you'll have to sign it.

39:04.759 --> 39:06.926
We're going to find out what's going on,
Mark.

39:07.803 --> 39:10.722
You're not leaving this room
until you tell us what's going on.

39:10.890 --> 39:13.266
So before you answer
any more questions...

39:13.434 --> 39:15.518
...I want you to think about Ginger...

39:15.686 --> 39:18.104
...and your family, and your career.

39:20.941 --> 39:23.443
What happened with Nakawara?

39:24.028 --> 39:25.612
Is there a mole?

39:28.949 --> 39:34.287
Well, yeah, I think there has definitely
been a mole, before, at ADM.

39:41.796 --> 39:43.463
- I made it up.
- Jesus, Mark.

39:43.631 --> 39:44.881
I had to.

39:45.049 --> 39:48.259
Look, we've had problems with viruses
at the plant...

39:48.427 --> 39:50.804
...and we're way behind our projections.

39:50.971 --> 39:54.599
Dwayne is thinking about shutting us down
and everybody's looking to me.

39:54.767 --> 39:57.811
It's all "Blame it on Whitacre."
That's how it is over there.

39:57.978 --> 40:00.230
We're talking about my job here.

40:00.398 --> 40:04.984
I came all the way over from Europe,
relocated my family. They made me a VP.

40:05.528 --> 40:09.155
Uh... Uh... What about the price fixing?
It isn't over, is it?

40:09.323 --> 40:11.157
I mean, there's no new attitude, right?

40:11.325 --> 40:15.161
It's been going on as recently
as three weeks ago. Nothing's changed.

40:15.329 --> 40:18.581
It's not just lysine.
It's citric, it's gluconate...

40:18.749 --> 40:21.876
A guy left the company because
he wouldn't do it. He was forced out.

40:22.044 --> 40:24.129
The gluconate guy, he's out of a job.

40:24.296 --> 40:27.882
I met with the guys from Ajinomoto
just last month in Chicago.

40:28.050 --> 40:32.345
The whole point
was to actually set volume levels.

40:32.513 --> 40:35.390
You set the volume levels,
determine what the market is...

40:35.558 --> 40:39.561
...and then you figure out workable prices.
We got another meeting next month.

40:41.021 --> 40:43.773
If there's anything else you want to add,
now is the time.

40:43.941 --> 40:45.900
What else is there?

40:56.036 --> 40:59.539
Seven-thirty a.m., March 17th...

40:59.707 --> 41:01.374
...1993.

41:01.584 --> 41:06.880
I have parked the car. I am approaching
the entrance to the office.

41:08.382 --> 41:10.383
Entrance breached.

41:10.885 --> 41:15.054
Terrance Wilson.
President of our corn businesses.

41:15.347 --> 41:18.475
Did our friend from Japan
call last night?

41:18.642 --> 41:20.226
No, he wasn't in.

41:20.394 --> 41:23.897
Well, I spoke with Mimoto
and he is pissed.

41:24.064 --> 41:26.566
He says there will be no peace
in lysine...

41:26.734 --> 41:29.819
...until we bring production down
to the levels we promised.

41:29.987 --> 41:34.532
Well, in '92, we did exactly what we
told him we would do in terms of volume.

41:34.700 --> 41:37.452
Exactly. Now, no promise.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.078
He says he wants to talk to you.

41:39.246 --> 41:44.542
Yeah? Well, I'll be right there saying,
"Listen here, you mousy motherfucker."

41:47.421 --> 41:51.883
That was Terry Wilson talking
about setting volume...

41:52.051 --> 41:55.762
...and price levels
with our Japanese competitor...

41:55.930 --> 41:58.348
...Ajinomoto Corporation.

41:59.016 --> 42:01.726
By the way, there was no discussion
with Mimoto last night.

42:01.894 --> 42:04.354
I did that for illustration purposes only.

42:04.522 --> 42:06.814
I repeat, no discussion with Mimoto.

42:06.982 --> 42:10.902
Morning, Mark.
- Good morning, Liz Taylor, secretary.

42:21.789 --> 42:23.790
- Please, come in.
- Hello. Good morning.

42:23.958 --> 42:27.460
Good morning. Hello. Good morning.
Good morning.

42:28.128 --> 42:30.421
Before we even deal
with Latin America...

42:30.589 --> 42:34.467
...we have to agree
that we are gonna swap numbers.

42:34.635 --> 42:36.427
It's the only way this is gonna work.

42:36.595 --> 42:41.474
Keep everybody on target.
It's possible to do. Got to be very careful.

42:41.934 --> 42:44.310
Need to check your phones.

42:45.479 --> 42:49.816
Excuse me, I need a comfort break.
Pardon me.

42:58.576 --> 43:03.663
Side two, tape one.

43:04.498 --> 43:07.417
I've got well over two
million frequent flyer miles.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.502
I'm pretty much platinum
across the board.

43:09.670 --> 43:12.130
I get a letter from the CEO every year,
thanking me.

43:12.298 --> 43:14.549
It's a form letter.
It looks like he's signing it.

43:14.717 --> 43:18.261
They probably walk in and he signs
like a hundred while he's on the phone.

43:20.848 --> 43:24.934
Oh, it went great. I think we're gonna
be able to keep it at a buck and a quarter.

43:27.855 --> 43:32.150
Now what happens? Something you
breathe in on an airplane, some bacteria...

43:32.318 --> 43:34.569
...and now it's in his hands, the cup,
the phone.

43:34.737 --> 43:37.947
Probably got it from his kids
and now I'll spend the weekend with it.

43:38.115 --> 43:41.492
I'll miss a few days or Alexander will
run a fever and who pays for that?

43:41.660 --> 43:44.704
Where does the FBI weigh in on that
as a cooperating witness?

43:44.872 --> 43:47.498
What does it say about exposure
to airborne contaminants?

43:47.666 --> 43:51.628
Tape seven, side two. Chicago O'Hare.

43:51.795 --> 43:55.381
Once again,
Terry Wilson representing ADM.

43:55.549 --> 44:00.720
Representing Euro lysine,
Alain Crouy and Philippe Rollier.

44:00.888 --> 44:02.889
That's a French company.

44:09.730 --> 44:12.899
That's a big break right there.
Absolutely.

44:13.067 --> 44:15.401
There's no choices to be made,
no debate.

44:15.569 --> 44:17.737
You're an ant, you just eat it.

44:17.905 --> 44:19.614
...part of the world where it works...

44:19.782 --> 44:22.075
...and the rest of the world
where it doesn't.

44:22.242 --> 44:23.326
It will not last.

44:23.494 --> 44:26.746
- Terry, Alain, Philippe.
- Hi.

44:26.914 --> 44:29.749
We obviously would play the game.

44:29.917 --> 44:32.919
- But the Koreans and the Japanese...
- They cheat.

44:33.921 --> 44:35.088
Then it won't work.

44:36.173 --> 44:38.841
Well, you make it work
in the other divisions. Tell them.

44:40.219 --> 44:43.262
Terry doesn't like me very much.
He's got blotchy skin.

44:43.430 --> 44:45.348
What causes that blotchiness?

44:45.516 --> 44:47.016
It must mean something medical.

44:47.184 --> 44:51.270
He'll have a stroke and someone will say,
"He was blotchy. It happens."

44:51.730 --> 44:55.900
If prices went up in Europe,
it's because we talked in Mexico first.

44:56.318 --> 44:59.362
That's right. You made it happen.

44:59.780 --> 45:01.739
It was our pleasure.

45:03.409 --> 45:06.119
Mark, these are just the kind of tapes
we need.

45:06.286 --> 45:11.374
And we're getting our marching orders
from Andreas. See? Goes right to the top.

45:11.542 --> 45:13.876
We need to improve the quality
of these recordings.

45:23.721 --> 45:25.430
Hey, Rusty.

45:26.849 --> 45:28.141
Take a look at something.

45:32.771 --> 45:34.105
What do you think?

45:34.273 --> 45:36.482
That's a nice briefcase.

45:36.650 --> 45:38.151
But wait.

45:39.653 --> 45:40.987
There's more.

45:44.491 --> 45:46.033
That...

45:46.660 --> 45:48.327
...is a Nagra SN.

45:48.871 --> 45:51.664
Had the Bureau custom-make it for me.

45:51.832 --> 45:56.002
Mark Whitacre, secret agent 0014.

45:56.670 --> 45:58.838
Why 0014?

45:59.006 --> 46:01.507
Because I'm twice as smart as 007.

46:05.012 --> 46:06.471
Ah. Thank you again.

46:10.893 --> 46:12.977
What happened to that girl
who worked for us?

46:13.145 --> 46:15.730
Didn't she move to California?
What was her name? Tina?

46:15.898 --> 46:18.441
Oh, Tina. Yeah, she's getting married.

46:18.734 --> 46:20.860
Ugh. My Tina's getting married?

46:21.028 --> 46:23.613
She's getting married
two or three weeks from now.

46:23.781 --> 46:25.531
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

46:26.033 --> 46:28.326
Well, that won't last long.
She's a bit of a dodo-head.

46:30.204 --> 46:31.204
She'll be back.

46:31.371 --> 46:35.208
I just hope she doesn't get pregnant
and fuck up that body.

46:35.375 --> 46:38.377
She had a nice body. It'll ruin her tits.

46:38.545 --> 46:43.007
When polar bears hunt, they crouch down
by a hole in the ice and wait for a seal.

46:43.175 --> 46:46.219
They keep one paw over their nose
so that they blend in...

46:46.386 --> 46:48.137
...because they've got black noses.

46:48.305 --> 46:50.765
They'd blend in perfectly
if not for the nose.

46:50.974 --> 46:54.811
So the question is, how do they know
their noses are black?

46:55.020 --> 46:56.854
From looking at other polar bears?

46:57.022 --> 47:01.859
Do they see their reflections in the water,
and think, "I'd be invisible if not for that."

47:02.110 --> 47:04.195
That seems like a lot of thinking
for a bear.

47:07.699 --> 47:10.159
Remember to pat them down
for wires before the meeting.

47:10.327 --> 47:11.577
What?
New policy.

47:11.745 --> 47:13.538
Whenever we meet with the Japanese.

47:13.705 --> 47:16.541
You're kidding, right?
I didn't get a memo.

47:16.708 --> 47:19.836
- I didn't get any kind of memo on that.
- He's kidding. Relax, Mark.

47:20.003 --> 47:22.380
They don't have the balls
to mess with ADM.

47:22.548 --> 47:25.591
When it's over, the board of directors
at ADM is gonna understand.

47:25.759 --> 47:29.345
They're gonna see the position I was in.
I acted in everyone's best interest.

47:29.513 --> 47:31.514
That's the only conclusion
they can reach.

47:31.682 --> 47:33.933
I'm the youngest division president
they've had.

47:34.101 --> 47:36.853
I speak a number of languages fluently.

47:49.283 --> 47:52.201
Would you like some coffee or fruits?

47:55.038 --> 47:56.539
No.

47:57.249 --> 47:58.583
No.

47:58.750 --> 48:00.418
Mark, no.

48:00.586 --> 48:03.796
- No.
- I told him the camera was in the lamp.

48:07.134 --> 48:11.971
We already spend more than one year
to get better market situation in lysine.

48:12.139 --> 48:14.140
We talked a little bit about it
in Paris...

48:14.308 --> 48:18.227
...but we need to come
to an understanding on volume.

48:18.729 --> 48:20.813
- We have public shareholders.
- Can you...?

48:20.981 --> 48:22.648
You need to widen out a little.

48:22.816 --> 48:25.109
We need to show them working
together.

48:26.153 --> 48:27.445
Now the question is:

48:27.613 --> 48:30.698
If the market grows, who gets it?

48:32.075 --> 48:37.747
If Kyowa Hakko, Miwon and
Cheil Corporation each get 2000 tons...

48:37.915 --> 48:39.498
...we can divide up the rest.

48:40.876 --> 48:42.793
If we're gonna have any stability at all.

48:43.754 --> 48:46.839
We need...
We need some specific number.

48:47.007 --> 48:50.635
Well, what would you be willing to accept?
Isn't that really the question?

48:50.802 --> 48:53.679
ADM has already eaten all the growth.

48:53.847 --> 48:56.182
We have a lot more
capacity that we're not using.

48:56.350 --> 49:00.144
We could be growing 20,000 tons.
Isn't that right, Mark?

49:01.021 --> 49:02.897
I'm going in. We gotta shut this down.

49:03.065 --> 49:04.231
No, wait. Hold on.

49:04.399 --> 49:06.317
- I need your input.
I think he's got it.

49:06.485 --> 49:10.029
ADM will be allocated its recent
production, plus...

49:10.197 --> 49:11.447
They talk about Paris.

49:11.615 --> 49:13.157
I can't understand.
The meeting.

49:13.325 --> 49:14.867
We have a big board of directors.

49:15.035 --> 49:18.245
They have a big board
of directors. And shareholders.

49:18.413 --> 49:21.332
And they're all suffering together.

49:21.500 --> 49:25.628
Well, where's the agreement?
I mean, this is just a discussion.

49:25.796 --> 49:28.339
If there isn't an agreement,
what are they doing there?

49:28.507 --> 49:32.718
You're getting bogged down
with the words. Just look at the actions.

49:32.886 --> 49:36.806
Look what happens right here. Okay?

49:36.974 --> 49:38.057
See what he's doing?

49:38.225 --> 49:42.019
Yeah, I've looked and I just see
a chart with a bunch of words.

49:42.187 --> 49:46.232
I don't even see any numbers on that.
I mean, I can't pinpoint an agreement.

49:46.400 --> 49:48.776
What more do you want?
The guy is standing there...

49:48.944 --> 49:51.028
...dividing up the market, plain as day.

49:51.196 --> 49:52.905
It could just be a proposal.

49:53.073 --> 49:56.826
All the other companies weren't there.
No one used the word "agreement."

49:56.994 --> 50:01.497
I'm telling you. From the perspective of
the Justice Department, it is not enough.

50:01.748 --> 50:05.251
We're having another meeting
to work out some of the issues in lysine.

50:05.419 --> 50:08.921
We have to divide up the volumes
and set prices for some of the markets.

50:09.089 --> 50:10.715
Europe again?

50:11.133 --> 50:12.174
Europe is out.

50:12.342 --> 50:16.762
There is a price-fixing investigation in
the cement manufacturing business there.

50:16.930 --> 50:19.390
It's got everybody spooked,
so we're not going there.

50:19.558 --> 50:22.018
We can't videotape in Japan.
That's not gonna help us.

50:22.185 --> 50:23.686
Hawaii.

50:24.896 --> 50:27.523
- Hawaii?
- Hawaii.

50:36.158 --> 50:37.742
Oh!

51:08.482 --> 51:11.484
Okay. So everybody just...

51:11.651 --> 51:14.487
Goddamn it, Mark.
Look at the size of this. That's bullshit.

51:14.654 --> 51:15.654
Yeah.

51:15.822 --> 51:17.406
Can you call and get us a bigger room?

51:17.574 --> 51:21.160
This is the only room they have.
- Will you call them, please?

51:21.328 --> 51:24.955
I will. I will. Make yourselves at home,
please. I'll call. I'll call.

51:25.123 --> 51:30.920
Do you have a suite perhaps that's a bit
more roomy for us?

51:31.505 --> 51:35.591
The Makuaha Room. Yes.
Is that your biggest room? It sounds big.

51:36.718 --> 51:40.012
But it is, I see. I see.
And for the whole day?

51:40.680 --> 51:44.767
Okay, so this is it.
We're here, we're stuck.

51:45.310 --> 51:48.979
Okay, then we'll make do. Thank you.

51:49.606 --> 51:52.191
Looks like we are here to stay,
definitely...

51:52.359 --> 51:55.820
...so let's settle in, and...

51:55.987 --> 51:57.279
...start.

51:57.447 --> 52:01.700
Oh, no.

52:04.037 --> 52:07.706
Well, I'd like to welcome
everybody here.

52:07.874 --> 52:09.375
Let me just...

52:09.543 --> 52:14.964
Indulge me for a second. I think you might
be more comfortable if I move the chair...

52:18.093 --> 52:19.135
Thattaboy, Mark.

52:23.265 --> 52:28.185
We have an old saying at ADM.
I think it applies here.

52:28.353 --> 52:32.022
"It's better to have the elephants
inside the tent pissing out...

52:32.190 --> 52:35.109
...than outside the tent pissing in."

52:35.277 --> 52:37.278
Outside piss?

52:38.071 --> 52:40.156
It's better to be part of the group.

52:40.323 --> 52:42.908
What he's saying is,
the customers are our enemy.

52:43.076 --> 52:44.994
The competitors are our friend.

52:45.245 --> 52:49.665
It's important we have all the producers
involved, including the Cheil Corporation.

52:49.916 --> 52:53.586
I want to know why we have been
excluded from association in the past.

52:53.753 --> 52:55.921
We need to be part of this.

52:56.089 --> 52:59.675
- Yeah.
- How can we know that ADM Will stay...

52:59.843 --> 53:01.594
...at agreed-upon levels?

53:02.762 --> 53:06.849
Well, it would be our preference
that we simply trust each other.

53:07.100 --> 53:09.143
And if we find out someone's
been lying...

53:09.311 --> 53:12.771
...we'll just hire some Mafia figure
to rub you out.

53:13.607 --> 53:15.316
That's just a little bit of levity...

53:15.483 --> 53:19.111
...but the point is
that if we can't trust each other...

53:19.279 --> 53:21.071
...ain't gonna work.

53:22.282 --> 53:24.742
You are okay with that?

53:24.910 --> 53:28.120
Yes. I am all right.

53:29.331 --> 53:33.792
So, what are we saying?

53:35.045 --> 53:38.297
Well, what,
do you have a language problem, Mark?

53:39.799 --> 53:43.469
Then we are ail...

53:43.637 --> 53:45.804
- Agreed.
- Yes.

53:49.643 --> 53:51.977
Agreement. You heard it.

53:52.145 --> 53:54.355
- Congratulations.
- Jury's gonna love that.

53:54.522 --> 53:55.898
Well done. You did it.

53:56.066 --> 54:00.986
Christ. How about this guy Whitacre?
What's his story?

54:01.154 --> 54:03.822
- What do you mean?
- What's his agenda?

54:03.990 --> 54:08.160
The guy's making 350 grand a year,
moving up and he turns informer.

54:08.328 --> 54:12.039
When does that happen?
Is the money going up his nose?

54:12.207 --> 54:17.002
Some woman somewhere with a kid he's
seeing on one of these business trips?

54:17.671 --> 54:18.754
What's his story?

54:27.180 --> 54:29.139
We wanted to show you this.

54:29.557 --> 54:32.685
That's a picture of Mark Whitacre
and his family.

54:32.852 --> 54:35.437
We carry that with us all the time...

54:35.689 --> 54:39.024
...as a constant reminder
that he is a real person...

54:39.276 --> 54:41.694
...with a real family depending on him.

54:41.861 --> 54:45.114
The only reason we have any
of these tapes is because of this man.

54:47.033 --> 54:49.285
We want to know
when the time comes...

54:49.452 --> 54:51.203
...if he loses his job...

54:51.705 --> 54:54.290
...will the government
stand behind him?

54:54.457 --> 54:58.585
Mark, are you an idiot?
- Ginger, I'll be the only one left.

54:58.753 --> 55:02.548
Mick will be gone. Terry will be gone.
Dwayne will be gone.

55:02.716 --> 55:05.551
I am a scientist
and I understand the business side.

55:05.719 --> 55:07.594
I'm the only one qualified to run ADM.

55:07.762 --> 55:10.389
Mark, that's completely illogical.

55:10.557 --> 55:13.225
How can you stay there
when you've taken down the company?

55:13.393 --> 55:15.227
Because they need me
to run the company.

55:15.395 --> 55:18.981
First of all, I'm extremely valuable
to the company.

55:19.149 --> 55:21.608
And secondly, I did the right thing.

55:21.776 --> 55:25.404
Okay? The board is gonna see that.
The board's gonna respect that.

55:25.572 --> 55:28.991
It's the FBI, right?
They're brainwashing you.

55:29.159 --> 55:32.745
It's Brian Shepard putting ideas
in your head to keep you working for him.

55:32.912 --> 55:36.165
I'm telling you, they will make me
the next president of ADM.

55:37.250 --> 55:39.418
So this is it, huh?
Yup.

55:39.961 --> 55:41.754
How's your family doing?

55:42.005 --> 55:45.674
Good. They're gonna be at an amusement
park when you guys make your move.

55:45.925 --> 55:49.011
Whatever happens tomorrow,
I think it's in your best interest...

55:49.179 --> 55:52.348
...to get an attorney who's gonna
represent your interests alone.

55:52.515 --> 55:55.726
- You want me to get an attorney now?
- No, not now.

55:55.894 --> 55:59.521
First, the company lawyers
are gonna come to all the executives...

55:59.689 --> 56:01.774
...with a list of attorneys to pick from.

56:01.941 --> 56:05.402
You've gotta understand,
these attorneys are paid for by ADM.

56:05.570 --> 56:06.779
They don't represent you.

56:06.946 --> 56:11.116
Do not pick one of these attorneys.
Tell them you have your own attorney.

56:11.785 --> 56:14.870
You need to tell them that you're
cooperating with the government.

56:15.038 --> 56:17.414
It's perfectly reasonable
for you to cooperate.

56:17.582 --> 56:21.085
I think I know a lawyer in Decatur.
I'll talk to him.

56:21.252 --> 56:22.711
The town is too small.

56:22.879 --> 56:27.216
I'm sure you've met lawyers in your
business dealings that could handle this.

56:27.384 --> 56:28.634
Definitely.

56:29.302 --> 56:31.595
Now, Mark? Mark?

56:32.055 --> 56:34.723
Once this starts,
it is going to be intense.

56:34.974 --> 56:39.061
They are going to know that somebody
was on the inside working with us.

56:39.229 --> 56:42.731
And they're gonna do almost anything
to find out who it is.

56:42.982 --> 56:46.151
But you guys still think I'm gonna be okay
at the company, right?

56:46.319 --> 56:51.323
I mean, you guys are gonna take
down the bad guys, but I'll be okay, right?

56:52.325 --> 56:56.036
Well, I think it's important
to remember...

56:56.204 --> 57:00.499
...what we talked about before,
and what we're talking about right now...

57:01.501 --> 57:04.086
...is tell them...

57:05.255 --> 57:07.673
- ...you're cooperating with the government.
- I know.

57:07.841 --> 57:11.718
But I'm just asking if you guys think
I'm gonna be okay at the company.

57:11.886 --> 57:15.013
The corporate culture's
gonna change a little bit for you.

57:15.181 --> 57:17.057
I should say so.

57:17.225 --> 57:19.893
- Yeah.
- We should just focus on the raid.

57:20.061 --> 57:21.103
- Right?
- Yes.

58:04.022 --> 58:08.400
- Mark, you're making that up.
- No, Archer, the A in ADM...

58:08.568 --> 58:12.237
...choked to death, 1947,
on a chicken bone.

58:12.405 --> 58:14.364
Fact. Fact.

58:14.532 --> 58:17.534
Well, there you have it,
from Mark Whitacre, Ph.D.

58:17.785 --> 58:21.163
You know what the Ph.D. stands for,
don't you? Piled Higher and Deeper.

58:21.331 --> 58:26.043
Heh. Let me guess. Daniels was killed
by a pig and the cows got Midland.

58:30.882 --> 58:33.342
A chicken got Archer.
I'll tell you, 50 years later...

58:33.510 --> 58:36.428
...our deals with Tyson Farms,
Foster Farms...

58:36.596 --> 58:38.055
...what's the body count?

58:38.223 --> 58:42.768
Mr. Wilson, Mr. Whitacre,
I'm Bob Herndon and I'm an FBI agent.

58:42.936 --> 58:45.395
- This is Special Agent Shepard.
- What is going on?

58:45.563 --> 58:48.273
- Mr. Whitacre, would you come with me?
I don't...

58:48.441 --> 58:51.693
- I have no idea what this is about.
- Mr. Whitacre, please.

58:51.861 --> 58:53.946
- Could you come with us?
- Do I need a lawyer?

58:54.113 --> 58:56.240
A lawyer? Terry.
- Excuse me.

58:56.741 --> 58:59.243
I saved a guy once at a restaurant
in Hong Kong.

58:59.494 --> 59:02.913
He was choking and I got him
to throw himself over the back of his chair.

59:03.081 --> 59:06.416
He sends me cards on holidays
just to say thanks.

59:06.668 --> 59:09.169
Tells me what his kids are studying.
He remembers me.

59:09.420 --> 59:12.381
You can take first-aid courses
from your local fire department.

59:12.549 --> 59:16.260
You got a reason for embarrassing my
colleague and I in front of a prospect?

59:16.427 --> 59:18.136
This is a serious matter.

59:18.304 --> 59:21.932
It involves an international investigation
into price fixing.

59:22.267 --> 59:25.018
We have seen you and your boss,
Mick Andreas...

59:25.270 --> 59:27.813
...conspire with your competitors
to fix prices.

59:27.981 --> 59:30.524
We have seen you tell others to do it.

59:30.692 --> 59:32.150
There will be indictments.

59:32.318 --> 59:34.486
Search warrants have been issued.

59:34.654 --> 59:39.825
And some people, people who you know
and work with, will be going to jail.

59:40.952 --> 59:42.494
Look at that.

59:42.662 --> 59:46.039
Look at that. Look at Terry and Bob.

59:46.207 --> 59:49.376
Oh, I wish I could be a fly on that wall.

59:49.627 --> 59:52.546
Oh, hey, I was good, right?
Didn't I seem really scared?

59:52.714 --> 59:54.214
I actually felt scared.

59:54.382 --> 59:56.466
Remember what we told you, all right?

59:56.634 --> 59:58.885
Tell them you're that cooperating
first thing...

59:59.053 --> 01:00:02.514
- ...and do not take one of their lawyers.
- Right. No.

01:00:02.682 --> 01:00:03.849
What'd you say to your guy?

01:00:04.017 --> 01:00:05.851
Nothing, I told him nothing. Slow down.

01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:07.352
Me neither. I said nothing.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.397
He said that he had price-fixing
tapes. What the fuck is that?

01:00:10.565 --> 01:00:14.443
Well, I bet they have the phones
tapped. I always said that. It's the phones.

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:17.362
I can't believe they would
pull this shit on Dwayne Andreas.

01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:19.489
Look, I get phone calls
from time to time.

01:00:19.657 --> 01:00:21.241
I know, I know.

01:00:21.909 --> 01:00:23.118
Oh, God.

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:25.662
We're going to the lawyers.
I don't want phones.

01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:26.997
See? The phones.

01:00:27.165 --> 01:00:29.499
They hit everybody.
My dad, Schmidt, Randall.

01:00:29.667 --> 01:00:30.709
Oh, fuck me.

01:00:30.877 --> 01:00:33.045
No, they played me a tape of me.

01:00:33.212 --> 01:00:36.298
Some meeting with the fucking Japanese.
I called the lawyers.

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:38.717
- We're gonna go there.
- Yeah? They played a tape.

01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:42.554
- How the fuck did they get a tape?
- I really don't think they have that much.

01:00:42.722 --> 01:00:45.098
When you factor in everything
we've done for them...

01:00:45.266 --> 01:00:48.393
...this will be a 10-year thing
for the lawyers. Maybe a fine.

01:00:48.561 --> 01:00:52.314
That's all this is ever gonna be.
Trust me.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.484
- How's it going?
- Good.

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:57.402
FBI.

01:00:58.363 --> 01:01:02.324
Yeah, he's here.
I got Agent Temples for Attorney Mutchnik.

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:06.578
This is James Mutchnik.

01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:09.081
Just interviewed
an ADM employee, Kirk Schmidt.

01:01:09.957 --> 01:01:14.211
Schmidt knew we were coming.
Says he knew about the raid days ago.

01:01:15.296 --> 01:01:17.381
He says Whitacre told him.

01:01:18.633 --> 01:01:19.758
Thanks.

01:01:19.926 --> 01:01:23.345
- He sees you sitting in the window and...
- Bob. Brian.

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:25.263
Can I talk to you guys for a second?

01:01:30.561 --> 01:01:32.938
That was amazing.
You guys should have seen it.

01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:36.274
Oh, Terry was so scared,
and Mick and the lawyers, they were just...

01:01:36.442 --> 01:01:38.151
- They were pissed.
That's super.

01:01:38.319 --> 01:01:40.696
They thought you guys
gave me the once-over.

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:43.198
They're like, "You all right?"
I'm going, "Yeah."

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:46.451
- Did you make a tape?
- Yeah, I made a tape. A great one.

01:01:46.619 --> 01:01:47.911
Really good.

01:01:48.079 --> 01:01:49.871
So it's over, then.

01:01:50.039 --> 01:01:51.081
Mark...

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:53.542
...who did you tell?

01:01:54.919 --> 01:01:58.755
- What?
- Who else did you tell about the raid?

01:02:03.344 --> 01:02:04.970
Well...

01:02:06.097 --> 01:02:07.764
I had to tell my secretary.

01:02:08.933 --> 01:02:12.602
Guys, I'm the head
of the bioproducts division.

01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:16.106
She has to know where to get in touch
with me. I told her months ago.

01:02:16.274 --> 01:02:19.818
So all I said was,
"Liz, I'm doing some work with the FBI.

01:02:19.986 --> 01:02:22.028
I might be out of touch for a while."

01:02:22.196 --> 01:02:26.491
That's it.
She had no idea about our case.

01:02:32.707 --> 01:02:36.168
I'm pretty sure I've mentioned the name
Kathy Dougherty a time or two...

01:02:36.335 --> 01:02:37.669
...in my division.

01:02:37.837 --> 01:02:43.341
Kathy is a friend. She is a trusted ally.

01:02:43.509 --> 01:02:44.968
I didn't want her to be scared.

01:02:45.136 --> 01:02:48.013
Why would you do that, Mark?
Why would you tell Dougherty?

01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:53.018
Because I didn't want her to be scared.
I trust her.

01:02:53.186 --> 01:02:55.604
- Guys, we can trust Kathy.
- Who else?

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:57.939
Don't jack us around, Mark.

01:03:01.694 --> 01:03:03.361
Mm.

01:03:03.654 --> 01:03:06.782
Kirk Schmidt. I mean, Schmidty...

01:03:06.949 --> 01:03:10.160
Look, I was afraid that he wouldn't
say anything to you guys.

01:03:10.328 --> 01:03:12.746
That he'd clam up on account
of he's loyal to me.

01:03:12.914 --> 01:03:15.373
You could have ruined
this entire operation.

01:03:15.541 --> 01:03:17.834
Has anything gone wrong?
Has anything gone wrong?

01:03:18.002 --> 01:03:19.461
Time out. Time out. Time out.

01:03:21.088 --> 01:03:25.467
Mark, you know what you did,
in our eyes, was wrong.

01:03:26.677 --> 01:03:31.056
- It was supposed to be a secret.
Look, we can get past this.

01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:35.101
But is there anything else
that we need to know?

01:03:35.269 --> 01:03:36.895
No.

01:03:37.772 --> 01:03:39.397
No, not that I can think of.

01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:47.739
Remember...

01:03:47.907 --> 01:03:49.908
...tell them you're getting
your own lawyer.

01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:52.577
I know about the lawyers, Brian!

01:04:38.916 --> 01:04:41.793
Mark Whitacre, Aubrey Daniel.

01:04:41.961 --> 01:04:44.588
Pleasure to meet you.
I'm representing ADM in this matter.

01:04:44.755 --> 01:04:45.797
Okay.

01:04:45.965 --> 01:04:49.092
- This is John Dowd, a colleague of mine.
- Good morning, John.

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:52.846
Dwayne has filled us in
on your responsibilities here, so...

01:04:53.097 --> 01:04:56.933
Aubrey prosecuted Lieutenant Calley
after the My Lai massacre in Vietnam...

01:04:57.101 --> 01:05:00.562
...so this ought to be a cakewalk
for him.

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:02.981
We were hoping you'd have time
to talk to John.

01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:05.650
- Sure.
- ADM's behind you on this, Mark.

01:05:05.818 --> 01:05:08.486
Dad and I want all the key people
to know...

01:05:08.654 --> 01:05:10.989
...that we're gonna be paying
all your legal fees.

01:05:11.157 --> 01:05:13.658
Oh, great. Great.
Thank you, that's great.

01:05:13.826 --> 01:05:17.329
Then... Then we'll let you fellas
get acquainted, okay?

01:05:17.496 --> 01:05:18.580
Okay.

01:05:20.833 --> 01:05:24.252
- How you holding up, Mark? Thanks.
- Good. Please, sit down.

01:05:29.216 --> 01:05:32.135
- John, can I ask you something?
- Sure, anything.

01:05:32.303 --> 01:05:36.681
If I say something to you, are you allowed
to say anything to Mick and Dwayne?

01:06:04.669 --> 01:06:06.544
Oh. Here we go.

01:06:17.014 --> 01:06:21.226
I need to tell you I'm gonna
be cooperating with the FBI.

01:06:21.769 --> 01:06:23.353
They have hundreds of tapes.

01:06:24.522 --> 01:06:26.523
They know all about lysine.

01:06:27.608 --> 01:06:30.568
And John here agrees with me
I should be getting another lawyer.

01:06:30.736 --> 01:06:33.363
Oh. No question about it.

01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:39.077
I want to say sorry
for everything that's happened.

01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:40.537
Sorry?

01:06:41.747 --> 01:06:43.331
What's that?

01:06:44.208 --> 01:06:46.543
It feels good to talk, to clear the air.

01:06:46.711 --> 01:06:48.753
You get to be like a balloon
after a while...

01:06:48.921 --> 01:06:52.757
...a balloon looking for a pin
to bump into and relieve the pressure.

01:06:52.925 --> 01:06:56.386
You could get sick from keeping it inside
and get a tumor or something.

01:06:56.554 --> 01:06:57.929
I didn't ask for that.

01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:00.849
I have a friend from school
who has a law practice.

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:04.185
And he's always telling me
how they can't talk about their cases.

01:07:04.353 --> 01:07:06.730
Like in The Firm.
You can tell them anything.

01:07:06.897 --> 01:07:11.067
They have to keep it to themselves or they
get in a lot of trouble. They're boxed.

01:07:11.235 --> 01:07:13.236
That's what they say: boxed.

01:07:13.612 --> 01:07:16.489
So there wasn't a saboteur
at all. You made that up?

01:07:16.657 --> 01:07:19.492
Well, maybe there was.
I mean, there could have been.

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:20.952
Okay.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.038
ADM steals technology
from the Japanese...

01:07:23.205 --> 01:07:26.458
...so I wouldn't put it past the Japanese
to do the same thing to us.

01:07:26.625 --> 01:07:29.127
But once I told the FBI
that I'd made that part up...

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:33.631
...they said I had very little choice
but to be a cooperating witness.

01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:37.802
And you began making tapes.
How many tapes did you make?

01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:41.056
There are over 200 tapes.

01:07:41.474 --> 01:07:43.141
Ooh.

01:07:43.476 --> 01:07:47.562
There are so many really nice people
in the world, people who want to help out.

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:49.814
Good neighbors, good listeners.

01:07:50.107 --> 01:07:52.067
Like when they had floods
in Mississippi...

01:07:52.234 --> 01:07:54.903
...and people lose everything
and are sleeping in a gym...

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:59.365
...someone always shows up with a warm
coat and a homemade pot roast.

01:07:59.533 --> 01:08:04.037
That's why Ginger and I bought that girl
a computer after she had the spine injury.

01:08:04.205 --> 01:08:06.623
That kind of thing
really makes a difference.

01:08:06.791 --> 01:08:08.666
Jim here strikes me as that kind of guy.

01:08:08.834 --> 01:08:12.295
He's the one-in-a-hundred guy who, when
you come into the emergency room...

01:08:12.463 --> 01:08:14.547
...you thank your lucky stars
it's his watch.

01:08:14.715 --> 01:08:18.093
...illegal campaign contributions,
whatever. Whatever we're talking about.

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:20.678
So then I'd come back.
Two nights a week or so...

01:08:20.845 --> 01:08:23.807
...Brian and Bob and l
would get together, and we'd...

01:08:23.974 --> 01:08:27.352
You know, we'd work it.
We'd build the investigation.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.938
Get everything we needed,
gather all the information.

01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:32.189
Then we went to DOJ,
briefed those lawyers...

01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:36.152
...and before you knew it, we were hitting
ADM, raiding the place, taking it down.

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:38.738
And for how long did you do this?
Work as an informant?

01:08:38.906 --> 01:08:42.367
Ahh, ooh. Two and a half years.

01:08:43.202 --> 01:08:46.662
Two and a half years.

01:08:46.831 --> 01:08:48.540
You know, and I always thought...

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:52.042
...there'd still be a place for me at ADM
when this whole thing was over.

01:08:52.211 --> 01:08:54.420
I still have a lot of friends there.

01:08:54.587 --> 01:08:55.630
A lot of friends.

01:08:58.716 --> 01:09:00.385
Hey, Mark...

01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:04.805
...it's very important to your case you
not discuss this with anyone else. Okay?

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:09.978
These people you work with, your friends,
they could end up being witnesses.

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:14.023
Bob and I are the only people
you talk to about this from now on.

01:09:14.358 --> 01:09:17.484
All right? And I want you to know
that you can tell us anything.

01:09:18.696 --> 01:09:20.196
- Okay. Yeah.
Okay?

01:09:20.363 --> 01:09:24.533
Well, they kept coming to the house
and they only had ADM's side of the story.

01:09:24.743 --> 01:09:27.287
Did you
talk to The Wall Street Journal, Mark?

01:09:27.453 --> 01:09:30.747
What did you say? It's real important
that you not talk to the press.

01:09:31.041 --> 01:09:34.210
Me? I told them I had no comment,
but it didn't matter.

01:09:34.377 --> 01:09:37.421
They had the story anyway.
They already had it.

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:42.551
Did you see my stipple portrait?
It's pretty good.

01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:50.435
Oh, shit.

01:09:57.234 --> 01:10:00.778
I'd appreciate any comment you
can make on the allegations on the TV.

01:10:00.946 --> 01:10:03.281
Just a quick comment.
What do you have to say?

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:08.536
I came out to tell you that I'm not allowed
to talk to the press at this time.

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:11.122
At least any comment
on the effects of your actions...

01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:13.124
...on ADM's declining stock prices?

01:10:13.292 --> 01:10:16.461
What's been the reaction
of your friends being taped?

01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:19.756
Well, I'm a person of interest in an
ongoing investigation.

01:10:19.924 --> 01:10:22.592
Do you believe you and your
family can stay in Decatur?

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.594
Has the government made arrangements
to move you?

01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:31.476
We're still getting
the threatening phone calls.

01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:34.771
And I know for a fact
that Dwayne and Terry...

01:10:34.939 --> 01:10:39.817
...have been telling people that he wasn't
a good worker and he can't be trusted.

01:10:39.985 --> 01:10:41.819
We told Mark.

01:10:42.112 --> 01:10:44.614
We told him
that he had to expect the unexpected...

01:10:44.782 --> 01:10:46.241
...that he might be attacked...

01:10:46.408 --> 01:10:50.119
...that he wasn't gonna win
any popularity contests for this.

01:10:50.287 --> 01:10:53.331
Well, he just mopes around here
all day...

01:10:53.499 --> 01:10:56.918
...watching the news,
looking for a glimpse of himself.

01:10:57.086 --> 01:11:02.173
Or he's calling someone from ADM,
trying to get the latest gossip.

01:11:03.008 --> 01:11:07.470
Maybe you guys should get out of town
until the hearings start.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.681
He's got to stop talking to people.

01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:15.812
Well, the FBI never forced me
to cooperate.

01:11:16.021 --> 01:11:17.772
I don't owe Brian Shepard the truth.

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:22.485
I gave Brian Shepard two and a half years
and now I have legal bills to show for it.

01:11:22.653 --> 01:11:25.154
And I'm the good guy in this,
the guy who took on ADM.

01:11:25.364 --> 01:11:29.033
Is Brian Shepard gonna lose his job
for that? His standard of living?

01:11:29.201 --> 01:11:32.704
I've gone to the school on career day
and talked about biochemistry...

01:11:32.871 --> 01:11:34.831
...and the career opportunities available.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:38.209
Can Brian Shepard and Bob Herndon
say that? I'm the white hat.

01:11:38.377 --> 01:11:42.547
I did enough for Brian Shepard.
Who's gonna take care of me?

01:11:42.715 --> 01:11:45.466
Who has a plaque for
the Mark Whitacre Environmental Award?

01:11:45.634 --> 01:11:47.885
Where are your friends when it's dump
on Whitacre?

01:11:48.053 --> 01:11:50.388
Where's the pot roast
and the warm coat?

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:25.131
You can see where he pasted it.

01:12:25.299 --> 01:12:27.508
He's a fucking forger.

01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:40.605
- Mark Whitacre.
- Hello, Mark. It's Aubrey Daniel.

01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:44.525
Listen, I'm here in Mick Andreas's office
and we were wondering:

01:12:44.693 --> 01:12:48.946
Does the name Lennart Thorstensson
mean anything to you?

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:55.286
What about Nordkron Chemie?
Does that ring a bell?

01:12:57.998 --> 01:13:00.375
I'll have someone get back to you
on that.

01:13:00.542 --> 01:13:03.127
Oh, sure. You do that.

01:13:06.465 --> 01:13:07.965
- He's going to call us back.
- Sure.

01:13:23.315 --> 01:13:27.777
My lawyer's telling me not to talk
to you guys, but...

01:13:27.945 --> 01:13:30.696
...there's something I've been wanting
to talk to you about.

01:13:30.864 --> 01:13:32.532
Don't tell us anything.

01:13:32.699 --> 01:13:36.953
You have a lawyer now
and it's not like it was before.

01:13:37.121 --> 01:13:39.497
We are not asking you.

01:13:40.499 --> 01:13:43.334
Okay, what if I just put out
some hypotheticals?

01:13:43.877 --> 01:13:48.506
And, you know, I'll talk about
certain financial situations...

01:13:48.674 --> 01:13:52.343
...and you guys can tell me if they're wrong
or how serious they might be.

01:13:52.511 --> 01:13:53.636
Okay, for instance...

01:13:55.514 --> 01:13:57.014
...what if...

01:13:58.142 --> 01:14:02.061
...a company gave an executive a car?
You know, a corporate car.

01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:04.689
And instead of driving that to work...

01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:08.359
...he drove his personal car and he gave
the company car to his daughter.

01:14:09.987 --> 01:14:11.529
Would that be a problem?

01:14:13.407 --> 01:14:14.824
That's it?

01:14:14.992 --> 01:14:17.201
That's the hypothetical?

01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:20.496
That shouldn't be a problem.

01:14:21.707 --> 01:14:23.166
Okay.

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:27.211
What if it was a corporate plane...

01:14:27.713 --> 01:14:31.090
...and the executive was using that
for personal use?

01:14:31.258 --> 01:14:33.384
Oh. Basically the same thing.

01:14:33.552 --> 01:14:36.053
Maybe some IRS issues, but...

01:14:37.347 --> 01:14:38.848
Okay.

01:14:40.642 --> 01:14:42.518
What if...

01:14:42.686 --> 01:14:44.687
...it was standard practice at ADM...

01:14:44.855 --> 01:14:49.734
...for executives to regularly accept
kickbacks in cash?

01:14:56.241 --> 01:14:58.701
How much money
are we talking about...

01:14:59.244 --> 01:15:00.786
...Mark?

01:15:01.538 --> 01:15:06.042
Well, Brian, hypothetically, $500,000.

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:08.836
- How much?
- It's the way things are done there.

01:15:09.004 --> 01:15:12.507
Okay? I'm not the only one
who was doing it.

01:15:13.592 --> 01:15:15.218
Everybody's doing it.

01:15:16.011 --> 01:15:18.930
When did this start, Mark?

01:15:19.765 --> 01:15:22.099
December 1991.

01:15:26.605 --> 01:15:29.106
You, uh, ahem...

01:15:29.274 --> 01:15:31.275
How were you paid?

01:15:32.569 --> 01:15:33.778
Paid by check.

01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:36.155
A check is deposited
in various accounts...

01:15:36.323 --> 01:15:41.786
...and always under the amount
of $10,000.

01:15:41.954 --> 01:15:45.540
And did any of these checks come in...

01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:48.626
...after we met?

01:15:53.006 --> 01:15:54.298
Maybe.

01:15:59.471 --> 01:16:03.015
Two-point-five million dollars,
deposited into an account in Switzerland...

01:16:03.183 --> 01:16:06.227
...while Mark Whitacre was there
on ADM business.

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:07.895
Now, we have sworn testimony...

01:16:08.063 --> 01:16:11.107
...from Mr. Lennart Thorstensson
of the ABP Corporation...

01:16:11.275 --> 01:16:16.445
...that he has never seen this contract,
and that his signature is forged.

01:16:17.155 --> 01:16:20.992
Neither he nor his company
have ever received this check.

01:16:22.286 --> 01:16:24.370
Now, it is clear to us
that Mark Whitacre...

01:16:24.538 --> 01:16:27.582
...driven by his own boundless ambition
to take over ADM...

01:16:27.749 --> 01:16:29.834
...has attempted
to frame his superiors...

01:16:30.002 --> 01:16:33.129
...in a price-fixing conspiracy
of his own invention.

01:16:33.297 --> 01:16:35.339
His cooperation with the government...

01:16:35.507 --> 01:16:39.302
...merely a smokescreen
to hide his lying, cheating and stealing.

01:16:40.095 --> 01:16:41.679
We have additional information...

01:16:41.847 --> 01:16:45.141
...that we are willing to share
with Attorney General Reno...

01:16:45.309 --> 01:16:48.352
...that the money has since been moved
to Grand Cayman...

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:52.356
...with the full knowledge and complicity
of Whitacre's FBI partners.

01:16:53.358 --> 01:16:56.777
What are they accusing
me of? I want the specifics.

01:16:56.945 --> 01:16:58.946
Are they saying I'm in cahoots
with the guy?

01:16:59.114 --> 01:17:01.324
Paragraph 8
in our agreement with Whitacre...

01:17:01.491 --> 01:17:04.035
...states that his actions
are directly attributable...

01:17:04.202 --> 01:17:06.704
...to the FBI
and the United States government.

01:17:06.872 --> 01:17:10.625
They're saying he stole two and a half
million dollars while we were running him.

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:14.170
But how could we know what he
was doing? He came to us.

01:17:14.338 --> 01:17:17.214
The question they're asking isn't
"How could we know?"

01:17:17.382 --> 01:17:18.758
It's "Why didn't we know?"

01:17:18.925 --> 01:17:22.303
No. The question is,
"Were they price fixing?"

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:25.723
The investigation has shifted
from ADM to Whitacre.

01:17:25.891 --> 01:17:29.393
Ha. Of course.
ADM decides Whitacre's a thief...

01:17:29.561 --> 01:17:31.729
...as soon as they find out
he's working for us.

01:17:31.897 --> 01:17:34.899
Who's counting money
if they can lose two and a half million...

01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:37.026
...for years, then find it in a few hours?

01:17:37.194 --> 01:17:38.235
We gotta call Mark.

01:17:38.403 --> 01:17:41.405
I don't want you to do that.
- We're taking you off.

01:17:44.409 --> 01:17:45.993
That's it?

01:17:47.579 --> 01:17:49.330
We're done?

01:17:50.749 --> 01:17:53.417
I thought the FBI never hung a witness
out to dry.

01:17:53.585 --> 01:17:55.753
He's not a witness anymore.
He's a target.

01:17:56.046 --> 01:17:59.715
I only kept a million and
a half dollars. And Mick knew about it.

01:17:59.883 --> 01:18:02.551
He knows these things went on.
Who do you think taught me?

01:18:02.719 --> 01:18:05.596
You can't bullshit these people.
Who knows what they know?

01:18:05.764 --> 01:18:07.515
We gotta go in with the whole story.

01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:11.602
It gets bad for you if you tell them you'll
confess and don't. Then you're screwed.

01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:14.271
This is it.
What you have in front of you, that is it.

01:18:14.439 --> 01:18:17.441
I've found every bank statement,
every record.

01:18:18.568 --> 01:18:20.778
Why would I hide anything
from you guys?

01:18:21.488 --> 01:18:23.072
This is it.

01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:42.925
I haven't been telling you guys the whole
truth, but I'm gonna clear that up in there.

01:18:43.093 --> 01:18:46.262
- What?
- No, we gotta get you out of here.

01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:48.264
No, no, I want to tell.

01:18:49.808 --> 01:18:52.685
Mr. Whitacre's conduct constitutes
a breach of agreement...

01:18:52.853 --> 01:18:54.145
...with the U.S. government.

01:18:54.312 --> 01:18:56.564
He is no longer a cooperating witness.

01:18:58.442 --> 01:19:01.318
This is outrageous.
My client has given you years of his life.

01:19:01.486 --> 01:19:03.946
Clearly, he made mistakes,
but he made your case.

01:19:04.114 --> 01:19:06.741
We are not here to discuss the case
against ADM.

01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:09.160
Mr. Whitacre, my name is Ed Herbst...

01:19:09.327 --> 01:19:12.496
...and I am with the FBI's
Economic Crimes Unit.

01:19:12.664 --> 01:19:14.665
This is Mary Spearing
and Don McKay...

01:19:14.833 --> 01:19:17.209
...from the Department
of Justice Fraud Division.

01:19:17.377 --> 01:19:19.837
And we were wondering
if you could tell us...

01:19:20.005 --> 01:19:23.632
...when your criminal conduct
at ADM began.

01:19:24.426 --> 01:19:27.553
In early 1992...

01:19:28.555 --> 01:19:33.184
...I was taught how things are done
there by Mick Andreas...

01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:36.854
...who showed me
how to use embezzlements...

01:19:37.022 --> 01:19:40.357
...and kickbacks
in order to make money tax-free.

01:19:40.525 --> 01:19:41.859
My client is voluntarily...

01:19:42.027 --> 01:19:45.946
No, I'm aware that the fraud
that I perpetrated...

01:19:46.114 --> 01:19:48.365
...was wrong and...

01:19:48.533 --> 01:19:50.201
...I accept responsibility.

01:19:50.702 --> 01:19:52.495
How did you receive the money?

01:19:52.662 --> 01:19:56.332
By check. They would deposit the check
to my account in Decatur.

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:59.210
They paid kickbacks in checks?

01:19:59.669 --> 01:20:01.629
What company would pay kickbacks
in checks?

01:20:01.797 --> 01:20:03.923
Well, I don't remember the name
of the company.

01:20:04.090 --> 01:20:08.636
It was, like, Agra Consulting and Trading
or something like that.

01:20:08.804 --> 01:20:11.388
You don't remember the company
that paid you checks?

01:20:11.556 --> 01:20:13.766
It's hard to remember for me right now.

01:20:13.934 --> 01:20:17.394
I have things going on in my life,
in case you haven't been reading papers.

01:20:17.562 --> 01:20:21.565
We're coming to you. We're cooperating.
We're gonna get the money back.

01:20:21.733 --> 01:20:25.736
I think this might help your memory.

01:20:29.741 --> 01:20:31.909
Now, where did we get those?

01:20:32.077 --> 01:20:36.413
These are ADM documents
showing forging of signatures.

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:40.960
Didn't these people see The Firm?
Or read the book?

01:20:41.127 --> 01:20:44.922
It's all there. Everything they did to me,
they did to Tom Cruise.

01:20:45.090 --> 01:20:47.424
I'm not the one they should be mad at.

01:20:47.592 --> 01:20:49.468
We can't see you anymore.

01:20:49.636 --> 01:20:55.432
And if you call us and start to talk
about the case, we'll have to hang up.

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:58.936
You can talk to us about your feelings...

01:20:59.396 --> 01:21:00.980
...but that's it.

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:05.568
Mark, please understand.

01:21:06.444 --> 01:21:10.322
It's not what we want.
We got no choice here.

01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:15.119
You know, the thing of it is,
all of my anger, all of my frustration...

01:21:15.287 --> 01:21:18.247
...stems from my work with you guys.

01:21:18.415 --> 01:21:20.457
And all this crap in the paper...

01:21:22.294 --> 01:21:24.211
My kids are seeing this.

01:21:25.589 --> 01:21:27.798
And it's all just dump on Mark Whitacre.

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:32.970
Remember, Mark, we told you
it would be impossible to predict...

01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:35.472
...what would happen
when the case went public.

01:21:36.266 --> 01:21:38.475
You never told us
about the $5 million you took.

01:21:38.643 --> 01:21:41.145
I don't see what that has to do
with the price fixing.

01:21:41.313 --> 01:21:43.939
He worked for you
for two and a half years.

01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:46.942
He risked his career, his home...

01:21:47.819 --> 01:21:53.032
...and now you just turn your back on him
and leave us out here.

01:21:53.658 --> 01:21:54.825
Yes, Ginger.

01:21:54.993 --> 01:21:57.578
The reason we came here today...

01:21:58.955 --> 01:22:03.167
...is because we're concerned
about your and Mark's well-being.

01:22:04.127 --> 01:22:09.673
It's important you tell the people
in Washington everything tomorrow.

01:22:09.841 --> 01:22:11.467
One hundred percent.

01:22:11.635 --> 01:22:15.846
You would have nothing without him,
and you know it.

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:19.224
He's being used by the government,
then thrown away...

01:22:19.392 --> 01:22:23.687
...because it's easier to go after Mark
Whitacre than anyone named Andreas.

01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:29.944
We took the kids one year
to the Renaissance festival.

01:22:30.111 --> 01:22:31.570
You get to be the white knight.

01:22:31.738 --> 01:22:35.324
The kids get to ride a horse and joust
against the forces of darkness.

01:22:35.492 --> 01:22:39.161
The white knight always wins. The forces
of darkness fall onto an old mattress.

01:22:39.329 --> 01:22:42.873
Someone plays a lute
and plays a song from medieval times.

01:22:43.041 --> 01:22:45.960
It was 90 degrees,
and the heat and humidity index...

01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:48.295
...I can't even remember
what the radio said.

01:22:48.463 --> 01:22:51.882
We were next in line and the mare
collapsed, went down in a heap.

01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:55.970
Ginger was eating Ye Olde Drumstick
and she dropped it. The kids were crying.

01:22:56.137 --> 01:23:00.015
And I remember this farmer saying
he had a gun in his truck. Just like that.

01:23:00.183 --> 01:23:02.601
From the white knight
to a gun in the truck.

01:23:02.769 --> 01:23:05.229
They had everyone turn
before they put the animal down.

01:23:05.397 --> 01:23:08.232
But even if you couldn't see,
you could still hear.

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:10.359
How do you get that back?

01:23:10.527 --> 01:23:12.569
How does that get to be fair?

01:23:13.488 --> 01:23:16.073
Well, he just kept buying things.

01:23:16.908 --> 01:23:18.909
We had eight cars.

01:23:19.911 --> 01:23:22.413
Three of them we never even used.

01:23:24.416 --> 01:23:26.166
And how else has he changed?

01:23:28.461 --> 01:23:31.588
Well, I was always the one
with the temper.

01:23:31.756 --> 01:23:36.010
- Mm-hm.
- And Corky was the happy one.

01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:37.761
But that's changed too.

01:23:37.929 --> 01:23:41.223
- There's one in Hong Kong.
Mm-hm.

01:23:41.391 --> 01:23:44.184
Then there are the accounts
in Switzerland and Grand Cayman.

01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:45.811
Right, right.

01:23:45.979 --> 01:23:50.065
Other things. There's a lawyer in New
York who's got a million dollars of mine.

01:23:50.233 --> 01:23:52.443
Have you told your attorney
about these?

01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:55.195
No, I don't need to tell...

01:23:57.282 --> 01:24:00.451
Mark, you need to tell your attorney
about these accounts.

01:24:00.618 --> 01:24:04.371
The assets were obtained legally.
I don't even know if I can trust him.

01:24:04.539 --> 01:24:08.125
Has anyone in your family ever
been diagnosed with bipolar disorder?

01:24:08.293 --> 01:24:10.419
You know, manic depressive?

01:24:14.549 --> 01:24:16.925
I have an aunt
that they used to say that about.

01:24:17.093 --> 01:24:18.594
Yeah?

01:24:19.304 --> 01:24:21.638
In terms of my parents, I can't be sure.

01:24:21.806 --> 01:24:25.309
My parents died in an automobile accident
when I was 6.

01:24:25.477 --> 01:24:29.688
I was adopted by a wealthy man in Ohio.
He owned amusement parks.

01:24:30.190 --> 01:24:32.649
I caught a big break there, big break.

01:24:33.234 --> 01:24:35.444
So my client's here to cooperate fully.

01:24:35.612 --> 01:24:38.072
Agent D'Angelo,
if you have any questions.

01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:42.076
This is your chance to put everything
on the table.

01:24:42.327 --> 01:24:44.328
This is your chance to redeem yourself.

01:24:44.496 --> 01:24:48.749
But if you're not going to be completely
honest, just stop talking now.

01:24:49.584 --> 01:24:51.668
I understand that.

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:55.631
I just want to tell you I feel...

01:24:56.674 --> 01:24:59.009
...bad. I'm so sorry.

01:25:01.387 --> 01:25:04.598
The last time we spoke,
I was under a great deal of stress.

01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:07.226
And I said some things
that weren't true.

01:25:09.187 --> 01:25:10.854
I want to clear that up.

01:25:12.357 --> 01:25:16.068
The first kickback was in 1992.

01:25:16.236 --> 01:25:18.529
Mick knew all about it.

01:25:18.696 --> 01:25:21.698
He told me there were gonna
be opportunities to take kickbacks...

01:25:21.866 --> 01:25:24.701
...on some of the contracts coming out
of Asia and Europe...

01:25:24.869 --> 01:25:27.287
...that were ADM contracts.

01:25:29.457 --> 01:25:31.458
Was there anyone else involved?

01:25:33.461 --> 01:25:36.630
So, Mr. Richter, we have...

01:25:36.798 --> 01:25:41.885
...money leaving your account
here and here...

01:25:42.053 --> 01:25:43.720
...and here.

01:25:43.888 --> 01:25:48.475
And it's going into Whitacre's account...

01:25:48.643 --> 01:25:51.228
...his wife Ginger's account...

01:25:51.396 --> 01:25:54.231
...and this is going
to Whitacre's parents' account.

01:25:55.316 --> 01:25:57.860
Like I said, those are loans.

01:25:58.486 --> 01:25:59.653
Uh-huh.

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:04.324
He had me set up a company,
Nordkron Chemie...

01:26:04.492 --> 01:26:08.912
...and just, like, issue
these fake invoices to ADM.

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.582
And there was a bank account
in Hamburg...

01:26:12.667 --> 01:26:16.086
...and so I would get a check
for like two hundred grand...

01:26:16.254 --> 01:26:18.839
...and most of it would go back to Mark.

01:26:19.924 --> 01:26:22.426
Ahem. Okay, look.

01:26:23.803 --> 01:26:26.763
We know you're looking out
for your friend Mark...

01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:29.600
...but your story doesn't seem true.

01:26:32.687 --> 01:26:35.147
You're right, it's not true.

01:26:35.315 --> 01:26:37.107
All the money went to Mark.

01:26:37.275 --> 01:26:39.151
When did it start?

01:26:39.319 --> 01:26:42.946
Mark told me about this Nigerian thing
he got in the mail.

01:26:43.448 --> 01:26:46.909
You know about these schemes
with the Nigerian letters?

01:26:47.076 --> 01:26:49.953
The 419 fraud?
Yeah, we see it every day.

01:26:50.121 --> 01:26:54.625
You get a letter from some official
in Nigeria asking for a few grand to help.

01:26:54.792 --> 01:26:57.794
- They promise a percentage of the money.
- Exactly.

01:26:58.338 --> 01:27:02.257
You ever wonder who was dumb enough
to fall for something like that?

01:27:05.094 --> 01:27:07.262
This is really embarrassing.

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:12.726
So how much money would you say
you made from your illegal activities?

01:27:20.985 --> 01:27:23.779
Seven-point-seven million dollars.

01:27:25.573 --> 01:27:28.533
But like I said, Mick knew all about that,
you know?

01:27:28.701 --> 01:27:30.661
He endorsed that kind of behavior.

01:27:31.996 --> 01:27:34.957
So not five, but seven-point-seven?

01:27:35.124 --> 01:27:36.333
Seven-point-seven.

01:27:36.501 --> 01:27:40.754
Jim, we all understand special
consideration, but we've got your guy.

01:27:40.922 --> 01:27:43.924
And these are cases we know
we can convict.

01:27:44.092 --> 01:27:47.177
Forty-five counts of wire fraud...

01:27:47.345 --> 01:27:50.013
...and money laundering
and tax evasion.

01:27:50.181 --> 01:27:52.975
So explain to us,
where is the wiggle room?

01:27:53.142 --> 01:27:58.355
I'm not stupid. Mark committed a crime.
He stole nine million dollars.

01:27:58.815 --> 01:28:00.357
That's pretty indefensible.

01:28:00.525 --> 01:28:03.944
But these guys at ADM, they stole
hundreds of millions of dollars...

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:06.321
...from innocent people
all around the world.

01:28:06.489 --> 01:28:09.408
Mark showed that white guys in suits
getting together...

01:28:09.575 --> 01:28:11.702
...that's not a meeting,
it's a crime scene.

01:28:11.869 --> 01:28:15.872
And not only did he tell you about it,
he got the evidence to prove it. Ha.

01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:20.544
When agents go undercover for the FBI,
they get trained for the stresses.

01:28:20.753 --> 01:28:24.464
We hear this all the time.
How easy it is for a trained agent to crack.

01:28:24.632 --> 01:28:29.052
I mean, here's Mark, a civilian,
with no training.

01:28:29.762 --> 01:28:31.638
But you guys just shove him in there.

01:28:31.806 --> 01:28:36.310
You tell him to go for it without any
training to make sure he doesn't crack.

01:28:49.198 --> 01:28:50.407
Ah! Baby.

01:28:52.827 --> 01:28:59.750
Ginger.

01:29:02.795 --> 01:29:04.004
They kidnapped me.

01:29:04.172 --> 01:29:06.882
They put me in a car.
They drove me around for 20 minutes.

01:29:07.050 --> 01:29:08.884
- They wouldn't let me out.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:29:09.052 --> 01:29:11.136
- My leg.
- Oh, Mark.

01:29:11.304 --> 01:29:13.263
It's all cramped.

01:29:13.723 --> 01:29:15.265
Who did this? Who took you?

01:29:15.433 --> 01:29:20.103
It's obvious. Look at my jacket.
These people mean business.

01:29:20.646 --> 01:29:21.855
I was abducted.

01:29:22.023 --> 01:29:26.693
I was thrown into the back
of a light-brown Dodge Dynasty...

01:29:26.861 --> 01:29:29.613
...by two thugs...

01:29:29.781 --> 01:29:33.408
...and driven around
in a 20-minute joyride.

01:29:34.077 --> 01:29:36.370
And basically, I was told...

01:29:36.537 --> 01:29:39.664
...you know, forget everything
that isn't on tape...

01:29:39.832 --> 01:29:45.212
...and you can forget about bringing it up
in a courtroom or for the media.

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:47.589
Did the men identify themselves?

01:29:47.757 --> 01:29:50.217
I think we know who sent them.

01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:54.638
And they sawed the locks
off the door, like Mafia thugs.

01:29:54.806 --> 01:29:57.808
Yeah, on each side, so I was trapped.

01:29:57.975 --> 01:30:01.311
You were trapped.
You couldn't roll down the window.

01:30:01.604 --> 01:30:02.979
No.

01:30:03.439 --> 01:30:05.941
Where was the FBI in all of this?

01:30:06.609 --> 01:30:10.153
Well, I think...
We think people have to realize...

01:30:10.321 --> 01:30:13.949
...that the FBI did the same thing.

01:30:14.117 --> 01:30:17.119
I mean, they locked my husband
in an investigation...

01:30:17.286 --> 01:30:20.622
...and they drove our family around
for three years.

01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:23.625
- Three to five years?
- Yes.

01:30:23.793 --> 01:30:27.629
In jail? But ADM's the bad guys.

01:30:27.797 --> 01:30:32.509
Everywhere we go, it's the same story.
It's just dump on Mark Whitacre.

01:30:32.677 --> 01:30:34.136
You gotta focus here.

01:30:34.303 --> 01:30:38.265
You stole $9 million,
and then you lied about it.

01:30:38.850 --> 01:30:40.350
Maybe in your head, you're good.

01:30:40.518 --> 01:30:44.020
To them, you're a guy who stole a lot
of money, and then lied about it.

01:30:44.730 --> 01:30:47.732
Ginger and I have been talking
and we'd like to file a lawsuit...

01:30:47.984 --> 01:30:50.777
...against Brian Shepard
and the United States government.

01:30:50.945 --> 01:30:53.447
Oh, my God. For what, Mark?

01:30:53.614 --> 01:30:55.365
He hit me with a briefcase.

01:30:58.119 --> 01:30:59.161
Mark, come on.

01:31:01.414 --> 01:31:05.292
And he told me to destroy tapes
that didn't help the case.

01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:06.918
Why would Brian Shepard do that?

01:31:07.086 --> 01:31:11.506
Maybe the question you should be asking
yourself is, what is Brian Shepard hiding?

01:31:12.508 --> 01:31:15.177
All right. I'm telling you, okay?

01:31:15.344 --> 01:31:17.220
Take the plea.

01:31:22.185 --> 01:31:24.519
Thanks, Jim, but...

01:31:24.687 --> 01:31:26.813
...we're gonna go a different way.

01:31:29.942 --> 01:31:31.485
Evelyn?
What?

01:31:31.652 --> 01:31:34.779
There's a reporter
from the Washington Post.

01:31:34.947 --> 01:31:37.073
Has some questions about Corky.

01:31:37.867 --> 01:31:39.576
A reporter.

01:31:42.205 --> 01:31:44.206
This is Evelyn Whitacre.

01:31:46.167 --> 01:31:48.418
What do you mean, adopted?

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:53.089
Well, as his mother, I can assure you...

01:31:53.257 --> 01:31:57.761
...that my husband and l
were not killed in a car accident...

01:31:57.929 --> 01:32:01.306
...and Mark was not adopted
by wealthy people.

01:32:06.562 --> 01:32:11.441
Mark's been telling people that you
and I were killed in a car accident...

01:32:11.609 --> 01:32:14.736
...and he was adopted by rich people.

01:32:15.488 --> 01:32:17.072
What do you make of that?

01:32:20.576 --> 01:32:22.661
That's kind of weird.

01:32:23.746 --> 01:32:27.415
I read this study in TIME magazine
when I was at Cornell.

01:32:27.583 --> 01:32:30.210
There were people who never believed
I would make it...

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:32.462
...into an Ivy League school.
Maybe Ginger...

01:32:32.630 --> 01:32:34.422
...who I met in the 8th grade.

01:32:34.590 --> 01:32:37.634
And the study said that people
had nice, sympathetic feelings...

01:32:37.802 --> 01:32:40.637
...about people who were adopted,
and treated them better.

01:32:40.805 --> 01:32:43.765
So I made up this adoption story
and people did treat me better.

01:32:43.933 --> 01:32:47.185
When I got a job, one of my professors
told people at Ralston Purina...

01:32:47.353 --> 01:32:51.064
...I was this guy that had accomplished
all of this in spite of being adopted.

01:32:51.232 --> 01:32:53.984
So it was really other people
who spread the story, not me.

01:32:54.151 --> 01:32:57.821
I admit it was wrong to start it,
it was other people who kept it going.

01:32:57.989 --> 01:32:59.531
Even the people at ADM.

01:32:59.699 --> 01:33:01.324
My new lawyer sees that.

01:33:02.535 --> 01:33:06.454
Tsk. This all goes back many years...

01:33:07.290 --> 01:33:09.958
...before most of us were born.

01:33:10.126 --> 01:33:13.336
It's bigger than any of us...

01:33:13.504 --> 01:33:15.088
...and it's ongoing.

01:33:16.299 --> 01:33:19.050
I know you're skeptical,
but I've seen it.

01:33:19.218 --> 01:33:23.346
My client, Mark Whitacre,
has shown it to me.

01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:29.144
Maybe I am just a personal-injury lawyer
from Taylorville, "Nowhere" Illinois...

01:33:30.021 --> 01:33:31.896
...but I tell you...

01:33:32.064 --> 01:33:36.276
...I know the identity
of the master puppeteer.

01:33:38.988 --> 01:33:42.532
- The who?
- The master puppeteer.

01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:44.326
And it's not who you're thinking.

01:33:44.493 --> 01:33:49.205
Mark has tapes, tapes that the
government doesn't want us to hear.

01:33:49.373 --> 01:33:52.667
Tapes that outline the actions
of Brian Shepard...

01:33:52.835 --> 01:33:55.253
...who hit Mark Whitacre
with a briefcase...

01:33:55.421 --> 01:33:58.173
...while Mark was cooperating
with the government.

01:33:58.341 --> 01:34:01.676
My client has a letter
from his psychiatrist...

01:34:01.927 --> 01:34:08.391
...outlining and confirming the cruelty
perpetrated on him by Brian Shepard.

01:34:09.185 --> 01:34:14.939
A letter from his psychiatrist clearly
exonerating my client from all wrongdoing.

01:34:17.735 --> 01:34:21.696
"It is obvious that the FBI
made some grand mistakes...

01:34:21.864 --> 01:34:24.616
...in how they handled and treated you."
There's a phrase...

01:34:24.784 --> 01:34:27.744
"Grand mistakes."
...coming from a doctor.

01:34:27.912 --> 01:34:30.413
"When one discusses suicide,
this is a red flag.

01:34:30.581 --> 01:34:33.875
When one discusses how they will do it,
then it is very, very serious.

01:34:34.043 --> 01:34:37.545
I also feel that the FBI requiring you
to do unethical conduct...

01:34:37.713 --> 01:34:39.964
...against ADM was another blunder...

01:34:40.216 --> 01:34:43.176
...that forced you into a bipolar situation.

01:34:43.344 --> 01:34:46.763
They should have known better
and noted that a medical problem exists.

01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:51.893
From a medical point of view, this is
attempted murder that the FBI did to you.

01:34:52.061 --> 01:34:55.105
From a legal view,
your lawyer needs to decide what to do...

01:34:55.272 --> 01:34:58.525
...and what the terminology is.
I'll support you in whatever you need.

01:34:58.693 --> 01:35:02.195
You and your family have been through
too much turmoil with the government.

01:35:02.363 --> 01:35:03.947
They should know better."

01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:07.951
That's Dr. Miller.

01:35:08.786 --> 01:35:10.954
I read the letter, Mark.

01:35:11.914 --> 01:35:14.290
The problem with the letter is...

01:35:15.251 --> 01:35:16.918
...it's a lie.

01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:19.629
What are you talking about, Brian?

01:35:20.131 --> 01:35:23.633
It's on his letterhead.
That's his signature.

01:35:23.801 --> 01:35:27.554
- What are you talking about?
- The area code, Mark.

01:35:28.347 --> 01:35:32.642
In the letterhead? The area code 847?

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:36.646
This letter was written
in November 1995.

01:35:36.814 --> 01:35:39.941
That area code didn't exist then.

01:35:42.611 --> 01:35:47.449
Okay, but they announced that the change
was coming. I even remember that.

01:35:47.616 --> 01:35:51.828
- People order their stationery early.
I thought about that.

01:35:51.996 --> 01:35:53.913
So I asked the phone company.

01:35:57.460 --> 01:36:02.672
This is the press release
announcing the new 847 area code.

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:06.843
It's dated six days after your letter
was written.

01:36:07.011 --> 01:36:10.346
Miller could not have known about it.

01:36:15.144 --> 01:36:18.688
Ron Henkoff from Fortune called
Dr. Miller and Miller confirmed the letter.

01:36:18.856 --> 01:36:20.982
If you talk to Henkoff...

01:36:24.528 --> 01:36:28.364
Ron Henkoff from Fortune magazine...

01:36:29.658 --> 01:36:32.494
...verified the letter with Dr. Miller.

01:36:32.661 --> 01:36:35.622
- I talked to Dr. Miller, Mark.
You can't...

01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:38.458
That's a violation
of my doctor-patient confidentiality.

01:36:38.626 --> 01:36:43.546
That's a total violation of my doctor-patient
confidentiality. You can't call Miller.

01:36:43.714 --> 01:36:48.134
Doctor-patient confidentiality
doesn't apply to forgeries.

01:36:48.302 --> 01:36:52.055
Then why did Fortune magazine
run the story?

01:36:52.223 --> 01:36:55.350
Well, why would Ron Henkoff,
for Fortune magazine...

01:36:55.518 --> 01:36:57.685
...put it in a cover story?

01:36:57.853 --> 01:36:59.229
Stop it, Mark.

01:37:00.189 --> 01:37:02.524
Henk... If you talk to Henkoff...

01:37:02.691 --> 01:37:04.984
You need to stop doing this to yourself.

01:37:07.238 --> 01:37:10.198
Why do you...? Why do you keep lying?

01:37:12.785 --> 01:37:14.702
I don't know.

01:37:21.502 --> 01:37:24.671
Well, I think maybe I should go back
to the hospital.

01:37:29.969 --> 01:37:36.724
Case 97-2001, United States
of America v. Mark Whitacre.

01:37:37.893 --> 01:37:40.436
You have a right to make a statement,
if you wish.

01:37:45.818 --> 01:37:47.277
Thank you.

01:37:49.321 --> 01:37:54.117
Uh... I really appreciate the opportunity...

01:37:54.285 --> 01:37:58.496
...to get up here and say a few words.
Um...

01:38:01.625 --> 01:38:03.167
Wow.

01:38:03.961 --> 01:38:05.461
What a ride.

01:38:06.046 --> 01:38:07.463
Um...

01:38:08.007 --> 01:38:09.799
Been a long five years.

01:38:11.594 --> 01:38:13.469
A lot of memories.

01:38:15.598 --> 01:38:19.809
I just really want to apologize
to a lot of people in this room...

01:38:19.977 --> 01:38:23.813
...and a lot of people who aren't
in this room, um...

01:38:24.607 --> 01:38:26.774
...for my actions.

01:38:27.860 --> 01:38:30.111
I'm on medication now...

01:38:30.279 --> 01:38:33.990
...so I'm seeing things
a lot more clearly.

01:38:34.158 --> 01:38:37.952
And I just really want to...

01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:40.914
I realize I hurt a lot of people,
and so I want to say:

01:38:41.081 --> 01:38:43.666
I'm so, so, so sorry. I greatly apologize...

01:38:44.293 --> 01:38:49.005
...and accept responsibility for my actions.
That's it.

01:38:49.173 --> 01:38:50.924
Thank you.

01:38:52.968 --> 01:38:58.598
To observe that Mr. Whitacre is not the
usual felon is a gross understatement.

01:38:59.308 --> 01:39:00.850
He's well-educated...

01:39:01.018 --> 01:39:05.647
...has a loving wife and family,
is well-respected in the community.

01:39:05.814 --> 01:39:08.358
It's not inconceivable that,
in due course...

01:39:08.525 --> 01:39:13.529
...he could have been CEO
of Archer Daniels Midland.

01:39:13.697 --> 01:39:17.116
However, this court...

01:39:18.077 --> 01:39:22.205
...can find no clear connection between
Mr. Whitacre's bipolar disorder...

01:39:22.373 --> 01:39:26.250
...and the 45 counts of criminal
misconduct he's been charged with...

01:39:26.418 --> 01:39:28.127
...just garden-variety greed.

01:39:28.295 --> 01:39:31.756
It's very difficult to tell
when Mr. Whitacre is telling the truth.

01:39:33.342 --> 01:39:35.093
I don't think what happened is fair...

01:39:35.260 --> 01:39:38.304
...when you look at me compared
to Mick and Terry.

01:39:39.682 --> 01:39:42.392
If you go
and hold up your local grocery store...

01:39:42.559 --> 01:39:44.519
...you get maybe five years in prison.

01:39:44.687 --> 01:39:49.774
Mick and Terry held up every grocery
store in the world and they got three.

01:39:50.025 --> 01:39:53.236
So you tell me how it makes sense
that I get nine.

01:39:54.154 --> 01:39:56.072
You should consider that,
Mr. President...

01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:59.033
...when reviewing this request
for pardon.

01:39:59.451 --> 01:40:01.452
I'd also like to take this
opportunity...

01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:05.039
...to apologize on behalf of myself
and my wife, Ginger...

01:40:05.207 --> 01:40:07.083
...to Special Agent Brian Shepard.

01:40:07.251 --> 01:40:11.587
He never hit me with a briefcase
or told me to destroy tapes.

01:40:11.755 --> 01:40:16.467
The idea to sue him
came from someone inside ADM.

01:40:16.635 --> 01:40:19.429
I shouldn't have listened.
I don't even remember who it was.

01:40:20.389 --> 01:40:25.435
While I was there at ADM, I lived so many
lives, I didn't really know who I was.

01:40:26.145 --> 01:40:31.107
And I know today more who I am
and what I really want out of life.

01:40:31.275 --> 01:40:36.362
I've completed three postgraduate
degrees while in detention...

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:39.407
...a J.D., which is, of course,
a law degree...

01:40:39.575 --> 01:40:42.785
...another advanced degree
in the psychology of jury selection.

01:40:43.328 --> 01:40:46.622
I sleep better here in prison
than I have in years.

01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:49.876
My wife, Ginger, has forgiven me.

01:40:50.669 --> 01:40:53.171
She actually believes
that this incident with ADM...

01:40:53.422 --> 01:40:57.467
...brought us closer together
in a marriage of over 20 years.

01:40:57.885 --> 01:40:59.844
And I hope you'll allow me
to leave here...

01:41:00.012 --> 01:41:03.723
...so that I can rejoin that life
with my family, my three kids...

01:41:03.891 --> 01:41:05.266
...two of whom are adopted.

01:41:05.768 --> 01:41:09.729
Especially in light of the fact that
in large part because of my testimony...

01:41:09.897 --> 01:41:13.024
...the United States government
has to date been able to collect...

01:41:13.192 --> 01:41:17.153
...over one billion dollars in price-fixing
fines from big businesses.

01:41:17.946 --> 01:41:20.782
So that's it. Thanks.

01:41:31.668 --> 01:41:33.461
Good luck with the pardon, Mark.

01:41:33.629 --> 01:41:37.131
Thanks, Bob. Thanks for helping me
remember everything.

01:41:37.299 --> 01:41:39.217
I wish Brian could have come.

01:41:39.468 --> 01:41:43.221
- Well, he's still pretty angry.
- Yeah.

01:41:43.388 --> 01:41:46.724
Well, tell him I'm real sorry.
Will you do that?

01:41:46.892 --> 01:41:48.184
Sure, Mark.

01:41:48.352 --> 01:41:50.686
The irony is
if I hadn't gone undercover...

01:41:50.854 --> 01:41:54.482
...I never would have stole the 11
and a half million. It was my way out.

01:41:54.650 --> 01:41:57.985
It was my severance. What else
was I gonna do? I had to write my own.

01:41:58.153 --> 01:41:59.654
Work detail.

01:42:00.322 --> 01:42:01.656
See you, Bob.

01:42:01.907 --> 01:42:04.700
- Eleven and a half million?
- What?

01:42:04.868 --> 01:42:06.786
I thought it was nine and a half.

01:42:06.954 --> 01:42:09.705
- What did I say?
- You said 11 and a half.

01:42:09.873 --> 01:42:13.709
You do know that the people at ADM
think you were the mole.

01:42:13.877 --> 01:42:17.255
That you planted the virus,
then made it go away.

01:42:17.506 --> 01:42:20.383
The 11 and a half
is with the interest.

01:42:21.343 --> 01:42:24.345
Mark, is it nine and a half
or 11 and a half?

01:42:25.722 --> 01:42:27.431
I don't know, Bob.

01:42:28.517 --> 01:42:29.725
You tell me.
