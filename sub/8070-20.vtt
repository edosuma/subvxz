[music playing]

00:03.704 --> 00:06.006
[harmonica music]

00:07.541 --> 00:10.078
That-- I know, Dan,
that's the throttle.

00:10.178 --> 00:11.379
Which is?

00:11.479 --> 00:13.214
Uh, like the gas.

00:13.314 --> 00:14.348
And this is?

00:14.448 --> 00:15.249
The brake.

00:15.349 --> 00:16.317
Which is?

00:16.417 --> 00:17.351
Like the brake.

00:17.451 --> 00:18.486
[laughter]

00:18.586 --> 00:19.887
And?

00:19.987 --> 00:22.323
You don't never want me to
use the two of them together.

00:22.423 --> 00:23.657
Because?

00:23.757 --> 00:28.296
Because it could rip a
hole in time and space and--

00:28.396 --> 00:29.530
[laughter]

00:29.630 --> 00:31.099
--we end up in a
parallel universe.

00:31.199 --> 00:31.999
[laughter]

00:32.100 --> 00:34.468
Correct.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.337
I can't wait till tomorrow
to really lay some rubber.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.139
[sigh]
[laughter]

00:38.239 --> 00:40.874
Look, why don't we just tool
around in the parking lot

00:40.974 --> 00:41.775
at Kmart, first.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.411
[laughter]
- What?

00:43.511 --> 00:44.845
You don't think I can
handle this thing?

00:44.945 --> 00:47.248
No, no, it's not that, honey.

00:47.348 --> 00:49.450
This is a very special bike.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.952
Yes, Dan, I know that
you love your bike.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.855
Gee, you spend more time with
this thing than you do with me.

00:54.955 --> 00:56.724
Oh, honey, don't get upset.

00:56.824 --> 00:57.925
Well, it's true, Dan.

00:58.025 --> 00:58.859
I was talking to the bike.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.761
[laughter]

01:03.697 --> 01:06.667
Well, I'm tired of
being the biker chick.

01:06.767 --> 01:09.069
I want the wind to hit
my body first, you know.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.204
[laughter]

01:10.304 --> 01:13.207
I want the insects to
splat across my face.

01:13.307 --> 01:14.975
[laughter]

01:15.075 --> 01:16.310
Come on, you get on the back.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.278
Mm.

01:17.378 --> 01:18.179
Come on.

01:18.279 --> 01:19.079
Mm.

01:23.551 --> 01:26.220
Wow!

01:26.320 --> 01:27.588
Suddenly I feel
like Ann-Margaret

01:27.688 --> 01:28.489
in "Kitten with a Whip."

01:28.589 --> 01:30.023
[laughter]

01:31.024 --> 01:32.226
[horn honking]

01:32.326 --> 01:34.027
Oh, look, it's our
favorite fun couple.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.663
Becky and anybody but that guy.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.365
[laughter]

01:37.465 --> 01:39.333
Oh man, he makes my skin crawl.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.069
Ah, honey, put on
your best fake smile.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.904
[laughter]

01:46.340 --> 01:47.241
Hi, kids!

01:47.341 --> 01:48.142
Hey, guys.

01:48.242 --> 01:50.344
Check out this car.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.746
Well, well, well, hey, Mark.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.282
What happened to your truck?

01:54.382 --> 01:56.083
It's my Buddy's car.
He's selling it.

01:56.184 --> 01:57.618
We brought it over
because Beck said you guys

01:57.718 --> 01:58.952
were looking to get her a car.

01:59.052 --> 02:01.054
Oh, we are?

02:01.155 --> 02:02.656
Mom, this car is cherried out.

02:02.756 --> 02:07.728
I mean, the frame is righteous,
no Bondo, V-8, tilt tranny.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.730
No Bondo?

02:09.830 --> 02:11.532
Not even a little?

02:11.632 --> 02:13.267
Wow.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.868
Dad, the motor's
in really good shape.

02:14.968 --> 02:15.869
Look at it.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.271
Mark did a lot of
the work himself.

02:17.371 --> 02:20.308
Yeah, I put in new brakes,
shocks, rebuilt the carburetor.

02:20.408 --> 02:21.909
Probably made
the license plates.

02:22.009 --> 02:23.177
[laughter]

02:23.277 --> 02:25.746
Hey, check out the tuna boat.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.248
I wanna sit in it.

02:27.348 --> 02:28.516
You know, this
thing has potential.

02:28.616 --> 02:30.083
I mean, just look at
the size back seat.

02:30.184 --> 02:31.919
All you gotta do is put a
little mirror on the ceiling.

02:32.019 --> 02:32.820
Shut up, Darlene.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.054
[laughter]

02:34.154 --> 02:36.557
Looks like you
retooled the heads.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.292
Yeah, new valves,
seals, everything.

02:38.392 --> 02:39.193
Nice work.

02:39.293 --> 02:40.794
And it's only $1,500.

02:40.894 --> 02:43.764
Thanks for bringing it by.

02:43.864 --> 02:44.898
Come on, dad, think about it.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.534
I won't need to bug
you for your car.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.602
Mom, you won't have to
be driving me around.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.804
You won't have to worry
about me banging up your car.

02:50.904 --> 02:52.406
Well, Becky, we
like all that stuff.

02:52.506 --> 02:53.841
[laughter]

02:54.875 --> 02:56.043
You got a nice
bike, Mr. Conner.

02:56.143 --> 02:57.611
You ever think of selling it?

02:57.711 --> 02:59.347
Actually, I'm planning
on being buried with it.

02:59.447 --> 03:00.581
[laughter]

03:00.681 --> 03:02.149
So, dad, what about the car?

03:02.250 --> 03:03.984
We'll talk, inside.

03:04.084 --> 03:06.053
[engine starting]

03:06.153 --> 03:06.954
DJ.

03:07.054 --> 03:08.922
[laughter]

03:12.326 --> 03:13.126
Starts good.

03:13.227 --> 03:15.095
[laughter]

03:18.198 --> 03:20.100
[dog barking]

03:23.203 --> 03:25.105
Listen, thanks for
bringing the car over.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.006
No problem.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.878
[cat calls]

03:34.382 --> 03:36.216
[laughter]

03:39.720 --> 03:41.855
[sigh] What's he gonna
mail you your tongue back?

03:41.955 --> 03:43.123
[laughter]

03:43.223 --> 03:45.593
[theme music]

04:24.131 --> 04:25.132
[laughing]

04:26.133 --> 04:28.536
[music playing]

04:31.104 --> 04:33.441
Dad, it breaks down
to like $100 a month.

04:33.541 --> 04:35.743
Darlene, this is
not your territory.

04:35.843 --> 04:37.478
Yes, but Becky's my sister.

04:37.578 --> 04:38.912
And what touches her touches me.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.881
[laughter]

04:40.981 --> 04:44.452
So she gets a car now, and you
maybe get one when you're 16?

04:44.552 --> 04:46.454
Well, you don't want me to
think that she's your favorite,

04:46.554 --> 04:47.955
do you?

04:48.055 --> 04:49.323
Well, I can live with that.

04:49.423 --> 04:50.223
What about you, Dan?

04:50.324 --> 04:51.124
[laughter]

04:51.224 --> 04:53.694
Hey, can we talk about me now?

04:53.794 --> 04:55.629
This is really important to me.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.431
I mean, how about if I
get a job after school?

04:57.531 --> 04:59.166
Well, now there's a start.

04:59.266 --> 05:00.133
Well, you know what?

05:00.233 --> 05:01.535
If we all start
socking it away now,

05:01.635 --> 05:02.970
maybe we can swing it by summer.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.405
Summer?

05:04.505 --> 05:06.407
Well, couldn't you guys lend
me the money now, and I'll pay

05:06.507 --> 05:07.875
you back after I get the job?

05:07.975 --> 05:09.777
Jeez, it's like $1,500, Becky.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.779
And that doesn't
even count insurance.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.614
Look, Becky, I
know how you feel.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.583
When I was 16, I was
dying for my dad to buy

05:15.683 --> 05:17.818
me this gorgeous '64 Barracuda.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.119
Man, that car was it.

05:19.219 --> 05:22.255
It had these yellow racing
stripes on this purple body.

05:22.356 --> 05:24.191
Dad, get out of
the wayback machine.

05:24.291 --> 05:25.959
[laughter]

05:26.960 --> 05:28.462
Look, I have $200 saved up.

05:28.562 --> 05:29.563
Where?

05:29.663 --> 05:31.365
You only got like $40
in your sock drawer.

05:31.465 --> 05:33.266
[laughter]

05:33.367 --> 05:35.202
Mother.

05:35.302 --> 05:38.338
Well, I got like $50
you can borrow, Beck.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.941
That'll just leave
you guys with $1,250.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.276
So what's in it for you?

05:43.377 --> 05:47.347
Well, I lend you the money,
interest free, and then

05:47.448 --> 05:48.782
when I'm 16 we share the car.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.784
You think I'd
share a car with you?

05:50.884 --> 05:52.019
No way.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.120
Then forget it.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.188
Junior Miss can take
the bus till she's 40.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.057
[laughter]

06:00.461 --> 06:01.929
I don't see why
I'm always the one

06:02.029 --> 06:04.064
this family who has to
make the sacrifices.

06:04.164 --> 06:05.232
Oh, yeah, right.

06:05.332 --> 06:07.435
Let's sell the villa
in France, Dan.

06:07.535 --> 06:08.669
We hardly ever use it.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.303
[laughter]

06:10.404 --> 06:12.305
You know, if you guys really
wanted to help me, you could.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.109
I hate it when
she gets like this,

06:16.209 --> 06:17.144
and there's nothing to eat!

06:17.244 --> 06:18.979
[laughter]

06:20.481 --> 06:22.683
I feel bad I can't
afford to buy her a car.

06:22.783 --> 06:24.718
Oh, she'll live.

06:24.818 --> 06:25.819
We've got two cars.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.488
She can use one at night
and on the weekends.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.322
Yeah, that one was
a real beauty, though.

06:29.423 --> 06:30.491
And she really wanted it.

06:30.591 --> 06:31.859
Oh, she didn't
even know she wanted

06:31.959 --> 06:34.161
a car till he put her up to it.
- Rosie.

06:34.261 --> 06:35.829
Well, it's true, Dan.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.965
Before she met him, the only
thing she wanted out of like

06:38.065 --> 06:39.567
was to see us dead.

06:39.667 --> 06:42.302
And now, you know, that's
not good enough for her now.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.571
She's gotta have a car, too.

06:43.671 --> 06:45.205
[laughter]

06:45.305 --> 06:47.508
Well, I miss the old days.

06:47.608 --> 06:48.509
[laughter]

06:48.609 --> 06:50.978
[music playing]

06:59.953 --> 07:01.855
[applause]

07:04.892 --> 07:09.563
All right, I been waiting
15 years for this moment.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.632
Today you are mine.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.033
[laughter]

07:13.133 --> 07:14.768
Come to mama.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.770
[laughter]

07:17.871 --> 07:18.839
[sigh]

07:18.939 --> 07:19.773
[engine starting]

07:19.873 --> 07:22.743
[singing] Get your
motor running,

07:22.843 --> 07:25.746
head out on the highway!

07:25.846 --> 07:30.217
Born to be wild!

07:30.317 --> 07:33.687
Born to be wild!

07:33.787 --> 07:36.557
Honey, honey, honey,
honey, honey, honey, honey.

07:36.657 --> 07:37.658
Honey, honey, look, look, look.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.993
Uh, before I take
you out on the bike--

07:40.093 --> 07:41.061
and I promised I would.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.663
And I will, and everything.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.765
There's just one thing you
gotta know about this bike.

07:44.865 --> 07:45.666
It's mine.

07:45.766 --> 07:46.567
Get off it!

07:46.667 --> 07:48.201
[laughter]

07:49.236 --> 07:51.872
Oh take a major
chill pill, daddio.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.173
[laughter]

07:53.273 --> 07:55.943
Me and this hog are going
out to tear up the highway.

07:56.043 --> 07:59.079
Now you can either come with
us, or you can eat my dust.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.413
[laughter]

08:00.514 --> 08:02.683
Look, maybe I should
ride it out of town first,

08:02.783 --> 08:05.886
and then you can take
over on the open road.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.121
You're just afraid that
some of your low life buddies

08:08.221 --> 08:10.457
will see you riding on the back
and think you're a big wuss.

08:10.558 --> 08:11.625
[laughter]

08:12.159 --> 08:12.960
Right.

08:13.060 --> 08:13.861
Move.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.128
[laughter]

08:15.228 --> 08:16.196
OK.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.966
- Hey, let's pop a wheelie!
- OK, ready?

08:19.066 --> 08:19.867
Ready.

08:19.967 --> 08:20.834
Hang on.

08:20.934 --> 08:21.802
OK.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.336
[engine starting]

08:24.638 --> 08:27.641
Oh, this'll be even more
fun once we start moving.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.109
[engine stopping]

08:29.209 --> 08:30.277
Now what's the matter?

08:30.377 --> 08:31.645
Something's wrong
with the bike.

08:31.745 --> 08:32.613
What are you talking about?

08:32.713 --> 08:33.714
It sounds great.

08:33.814 --> 08:35.182
It's not nearly as noisy
as it was yesterday.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.349
Well, I like it noisy.

08:36.449 --> 08:37.350
I keep it noisy.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.119
Somebody's been
messing around with it.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.888
Like somebody who knows
about carburetors.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.827
Becky, get down here now!

08:46.927 --> 08:48.061
What's going on?

08:48.161 --> 08:50.564
Weren't you gonna take
your brother to the movies?

08:50.664 --> 08:51.599
It doesn't start for an hour.

08:51.699 --> 08:52.766
Well, walk really slow.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.768
[laughter]

08:57.337 --> 08:58.371
I thought you were going.

08:58.471 --> 08:59.840
Did you and Mark
take out my Harley?

09:02.475 --> 09:04.111
Answer me.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.879
Yeah.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.781
You are never to
touch that bike, ever.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.016
You know that.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.918
You guys said I could
have a car on the weekend,

09:11.018 --> 09:13.754
and then you took both
of them last night.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.923
What's, so that's supposed
to make it all right?

09:16.023 --> 09:16.990
Dad, the bike's fine.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.426
Mark even adjusted the
carburetor for you.

09:19.526 --> 09:21.128
I never asked your punk
boyfriend for a tune up.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.495
And I certainly never
gave you permission

09:22.596 --> 09:23.764
to take that bike out, ever!

09:28.201 --> 09:29.102
[door slamming]

09:34.507 --> 09:35.408
OK, I'm sorry.

09:35.508 --> 09:36.476
It was a stupid thing to do.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.746
No, it was way beyond stupid.

09:38.846 --> 09:40.047
You know what this
bike means to me.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.649
But you figure you don't
have a car one night,

09:41.749 --> 09:44.284
so you just go behind
my back and take it.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.053
Well, if I woulda asked,
you woulda said no anyway.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.888
That's right!
What does that tell you?

09:51.091 --> 09:51.892
OK, fine.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.827
So how long am I grounded for?

09:53.927 --> 09:55.929
You don't get
it, do you, Becky?

09:56.029 --> 09:57.765
This isn't some little
stupid curfew you broke.

09:57.865 --> 09:58.666
Dad--

09:58.766 --> 09:59.733
No!

09:59.833 --> 10:01.001
You've been given us
crap for months now,

10:01.101 --> 10:02.736
and I've been on your side.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.872
I duked it out with your mom
over letting you see Mark.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.606
I was working with
you on this car deal.

10:06.707 --> 10:07.941
But you could care less.

10:08.041 --> 10:11.578
Well, I'm tired of bending
over backwards for you, Becky.

10:11.679 --> 10:13.781
So if I'm not
grounded, then what?

10:13.881 --> 10:15.382
Then, uh, nothing.

10:15.482 --> 10:16.717
I mean, what's the point?

10:16.817 --> 10:18.752
You're just gonna do whatever
the hell you want, anyway.

10:18.852 --> 10:19.753
Dad, I said I'm sorry!

10:19.853 --> 10:20.721
I don't care what you said.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.222
Just get the hell
out of my sight.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.692
[music playing]

10:26.760 --> 10:29.129
[music playing]

10:31.699 --> 10:34.367
So now you're going
to be a masseuse?

10:34.467 --> 10:35.703
How'd you come up
with that idea?

10:35.803 --> 10:38.005
What, did you open the phone
book to the middle and point?

10:38.105 --> 10:39.206
[laughter]

10:39.306 --> 10:41.508
I'm just sending off
for more information.

10:41.608 --> 10:44.678
And it's not masseuse,
it's massage therapist.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.113
[laughter]

10:46.213 --> 10:47.147
Well, so what?

10:47.247 --> 10:48.849
When people ask me
what my sister does,

10:48.949 --> 10:51.118
I have to tell them that she,
like, rubs people for money.

10:51.218 --> 10:52.853
[laughter]

10:52.953 --> 10:55.555
Shut up and give me a stamp.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.924
Good morning.

10:57.024 --> 10:59.359
Hey, Dan, Jackie's
gonna learn to be

10:59.459 --> 11:01.094
a masseuse through the mail.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.896
[laughter]

11:02.996 --> 11:03.997
Jeez, Jack, what happened?

11:04.097 --> 11:04.898
Your sea monkeys die?

11:04.998 --> 11:06.433
[laughter]

11:07.600 --> 11:10.370
Can I get a little
support around here?

11:10.470 --> 11:12.906
Oh, we're sorry.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.341
Hey, guess what.
Jackie's gonna be a--

11:14.441 --> 11:15.242
Shut up!

11:15.342 --> 11:17.077
[laughter]

11:18.111 --> 11:19.279
Oh, that's OK.
Go ahead, Dad.

11:19.379 --> 11:20.180
No, that's OK.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.481
I gotta get to the job site.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.854
So what are you
gonna do today, Becky?

11:26.954 --> 11:28.021
I gotta go to the library.

11:28.121 --> 11:29.823
I have a report due on Monday.

11:29.923 --> 11:32.192
Oh, Dan, maybe you
could drop her off.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.727
The library?

11:33.827 --> 11:36.096
I don't know.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.364
Yeah, sure you do, honey.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.732
You remember it
from high school.

11:38.832 --> 11:39.632
That--

11:39.733 --> 11:40.834
[laughter]

11:40.934 --> 11:43.003
--that big brick building
we used to smoke behind.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.437
[laughter]

11:44.537 --> 11:45.338
I'm late.

11:45.438 --> 11:46.606
Bye bye.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.507
Bye, dad.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.782
I'll give you a ride, Becky.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.549
That's OK.

11:56.649 --> 11:59.086
I'll see you later.

11:59.186 --> 11:59.987
Damn.

12:00.087 --> 12:00.888
Yeah.

12:00.988 --> 12:01.789
It's that Mark.

12:01.889 --> 12:04.758
Oh, here we go.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.093
What are you doing?

12:06.193 --> 12:08.661
You finished breakfast.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.530
Why don't you go rub somebody?

12:10.630 --> 12:11.631
[laughter]

12:11.731 --> 12:14.134
Look, if it was gonna
make you that crazy,

12:14.234 --> 12:15.135
why'd you let Becky see Mark?

12:15.235 --> 12:16.036
I didn't.

12:16.136 --> 12:16.937
Dan did.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.271
Well, you agreed.

12:18.371 --> 12:21.108
Well, she's just
gonna go see him anyway.

12:21.208 --> 12:22.742
So you caved.

12:22.843 --> 12:23.777
No, we didn't cave.

12:23.877 --> 12:24.711
OK.

12:24.812 --> 12:27.114
OK, we did cave,
but on our terms.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.015
[laughter]

12:28.115 --> 12:29.749
Roseanne.

12:29.850 --> 12:30.650
I hate that kid.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.019
He drives me nuts.

12:32.119 --> 12:34.254
You know them to pieces of hair
he's got going on his face,

12:34.354 --> 12:35.222
like that?
JACKIE: Yes.

12:35.322 --> 12:36.957
Well, I hate those
pieces of hair.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.025
I hate both of them.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.927
Sometimes I just sit
up there in that chair,

12:40.027 --> 12:41.795
and I try to figure out
which one I hate worst!

12:41.895 --> 12:43.130
[laughter]

12:43.230 --> 12:45.799
You're losing it!

12:45.899 --> 12:47.134
Oh, catch up, Jackie.

12:47.234 --> 12:48.869
I have already lost it.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.737
[laughter]

12:50.838 --> 12:55.575
And now-- now there
are no doughnuts!

12:55.675 --> 12:57.544
[laughter]

12:57.644 --> 12:59.980
[music playing]

13:07.454 --> 13:08.822
[knocking]

13:16.796 --> 13:19.632
Oh, man.

13:19.732 --> 13:22.269
What do you want?

13:22.369 --> 13:27.074
Well, I wanna know what's
the deal between you and Becky.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.942
What are you asking me for?
Why don't you ask her?

13:29.042 --> 13:30.710
Because I don't
know her anymore.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.980
Ever since she got with you, she
lies, she ran away from home.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.781
You've got her
stealing motorcycles.

13:34.882 --> 13:37.317
So I just want you to tell
me, Mark, what's next.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.819
You know, just so that
I'm not surprised.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.754
Well, I'd figure I'd get her
to knock over a convenience

13:41.855 --> 13:42.890
store or two.

13:42.990 --> 13:46.259
But don't worry, I'll
have her back by 10:00.

13:46.359 --> 13:49.829
You think that's so funny,
don't you, you little punk?

13:49.930 --> 13:51.398
Look, this is my
place that you're in.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.267
If you're gonna talk to me
like that, you can just leave.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.568
I want you to stop seeing her.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.905
No.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.672
Why?

13:59.772 --> 14:00.840
Why, Mark?

14:00.941 --> 14:02.642
Are you sleeping with her?

14:02.742 --> 14:04.044
Because if you
are, I'm gonna have

14:04.144 --> 14:06.079
your butt in jail so fast you
won't even know what hit you.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.814
She's 16 and you're 18.

14:07.915 --> 14:10.083
And in case you don't know
it, that's illegal, buddy.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.821
I don't even know what
I'm asking you for.

14:14.922 --> 14:17.257
I don't believe nothing
you say, anyhow.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.027
I don't care.

14:20.127 --> 14:22.195
You have nothing
in common with her.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.897
I like her.

14:23.997 --> 14:24.898
Why?

14:24.998 --> 14:25.798
What do you mean, why?

14:25.899 --> 14:27.067
Don't you?

14:27.167 --> 14:28.368
Oh, don't give me that crap.

14:28.468 --> 14:29.336
[laughter]

14:29.436 --> 14:30.470
It's not crap.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.372
I like her and she likes me.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.807
And you can threaten me, and
your husband can threaten me,

14:34.908 --> 14:36.743
but it's not gonna change
a thing, and you know that.

14:39.846 --> 14:40.747
[sigh]

14:42.349 --> 14:45.218
Yeah, I do know it.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.553
I can't compete with you, Mark.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.888
I'm only her mother.

14:48.989 --> 14:49.822
[sigh]

14:50.924 --> 14:52.192
I hope you really
do care about her.

14:57.998 --> 14:58.798
Mrs. Conner.

15:09.509 --> 15:10.944
Tell your husband he
shouldn't open his carb

15:11.044 --> 15:12.079
all the way up
unless he's tooling

15:12.179 --> 15:15.848
around at some high altitude.

15:15.949 --> 15:19.419
Yeah, well, the next
time we're discussing

15:19.519 --> 15:21.521
carbs I'll be sure
to bring that up.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.456
[laughter]

15:27.427 --> 15:29.262
[laughter]

15:32.265 --> 15:33.200
That's much better.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.634
[laughter]

15:34.734 --> 15:36.603
[applause]

15:36.703 --> 15:39.039
[music playing]

15:45.445 --> 15:47.314
DARLENE: Your bike sounds
pretty bad now, dad.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.482
Yeah, the secret is to
open up the carb all the way.

15:49.582 --> 15:50.817
[laughter]

15:50.917 --> 15:52.185
Excuse me.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.754
Sorry.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.156
Hey there, Beckface.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.390
Hey.

15:57.490 --> 16:00.760
Hey, Darlene, how about
one of the old man's

16:00.860 --> 16:03.096
patented chocolate
chip milkshakes?

16:03.196 --> 16:04.164
Sure, I could use a rush.

16:04.264 --> 16:05.432
[laughter]

16:06.833 --> 16:11.638
OK, let's see, ice cream,
chocolate syrup, skim milk.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.140
I think we're all set.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.041
Blender.

16:14.141 --> 16:16.209
Blender.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.110
OK.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.179
Excuse me.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.448
Darlene, what's your pleasure?

16:21.548 --> 16:23.683
Thick thick, medium
thick, or thin thick?

16:23.783 --> 16:24.984
Medium thick.

16:25.085 --> 16:28.321
All right, chicken.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.723
OK, stand back, let
the doctor do his work.

16:52.645 --> 16:55.014
Becky?

16:55.115 --> 16:58.017
What's up?

16:58.118 --> 16:59.986
You want a milkshake?

17:00.087 --> 17:00.887
Thick thick?

17:03.856 --> 17:06.126
OK.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.228
Listen, I've got an idea.

17:08.328 --> 17:09.896
Why don't I cut out
the silent treatment,

17:09.996 --> 17:11.764
and you can forget
that I'm your father

17:11.864 --> 17:13.066
and treat me like a human being.

17:13.166 --> 17:13.966
Deal?

17:16.436 --> 17:17.337
Look, dad, I'm really sorry.

17:17.437 --> 17:18.238
I know.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.277
[laughter]

17:27.347 --> 17:30.817
So, what have you been up
to the last couple days?

17:30.917 --> 17:33.420
You still like this Mark guy?

17:33.520 --> 17:34.821
Yeah.

17:34.921 --> 17:36.923
And I know you think it was has
his idea to take out the bike.

17:37.023 --> 17:37.957
But it wasn't.

17:38.057 --> 17:38.858
It was mine.

17:38.958 --> 17:39.792
I know.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.594
It's that rebel Conner thing.

17:41.694 --> 17:42.995
It runs in the family.

17:43.096 --> 17:44.197
[laughter]

17:44.297 --> 17:45.598
And I want you to know I'm
not gonna stand for it.

17:45.698 --> 17:46.733
[laughter]

17:46.833 --> 17:49.536
I just don't want you
to hate Mark, you know.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.871
- I don't hate Mark.
- Mom does.

17:51.971 --> 17:53.240
Oh, mom definitely hates him.

17:53.340 --> 17:54.641
[laughter]

17:56.143 --> 17:58.945
Definitely.

17:59.045 --> 18:01.314
Hate.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.315
Mom does, yes.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.983
[laughter]

18:04.517 --> 18:05.252
Why?

18:05.352 --> 18:07.420
She doesn't even know him.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.590
She's afraid of him, Becky.

18:10.690 --> 18:13.826
You see, when she was 16, this
guy pulled in her driveway

18:13.926 --> 18:15.662
with a motorcycle.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.964
And god, your grandma
hated that guy.

18:18.064 --> 18:19.199
[laughter]

18:20.233 --> 18:21.368
And I think that's
half the reason

18:21.468 --> 18:24.337
why your mom married him.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.805
Dad, I'm not gonna marry him.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.607
I mean, jeez, I'm 16 years old.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.276
That's exactly what
she told her folks.

18:29.376 --> 18:31.878
And here we are.

18:31.978 --> 18:35.748
I mean it, dad, I'm way too
young to think about marriage.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.350
Anyway, I'd have to
live with him first.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.085
Excuse me a moment.

18:39.186 --> 18:41.020
[laughter]

18:47.960 --> 18:48.995
Dad, cut it out.

18:49.095 --> 18:51.498
I mean, you know I want
to, like, go to Europe,

18:51.598 --> 18:55.268
and go to college, and
have a career, and stuff.

18:55.368 --> 18:57.937
Well, how would we know that?

18:58.037 --> 19:01.908
I mean, the last time you
and I talked like this, you

19:02.008 --> 19:03.310
wanted to be a fairy princess.

19:03.410 --> 19:04.611
[laughter]

19:06.446 --> 19:08.014
I guess it's been a while.

19:08.114 --> 19:09.649
Yeah, and from what
we've been hearing,

19:09.749 --> 19:11.818
your whole life is Mark.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.286
Well, it's not.

19:13.386 --> 19:14.621
Well, tell your mom that.

19:19.459 --> 19:20.860
Thick thick?

19:20.960 --> 19:21.761
Yeah.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.701
Dad.

19:28.801 --> 19:31.170
[sentimental music]

19:42.549 --> 19:44.217
Been a long time for that, too.

19:47.820 --> 19:50.189
[music playing]

19:52.225 --> 19:54.060
[laughter]

19:59.031 --> 20:00.066
Too thick, Beck?

20:00.166 --> 20:01.033
[laughter]

20:02.034 --> 20:03.536
I think I just broke a rib.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.238
[laughter]

20:05.338 --> 20:06.973
Here, try a spoon.

20:07.073 --> 20:08.408
- Thanks.
- You got it.

20:08.508 --> 20:09.576
[door closing]
- Oh, gross.

20:09.676 --> 20:10.910
[laughter]

20:12.512 --> 20:13.313
Hey.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.214
Hey.

20:15.315 --> 20:16.215
What's going on?

20:16.316 --> 20:17.116
Nothing.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.117
Not much.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.319
Oh, please.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.920
Dad and Becky made up,
and they're being so nice

20:21.020 --> 20:21.954
to each other it's pathetic.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.890
[laughter]

20:23.990 --> 20:28.395
Is that your, uh, world famous
chocolate chip shake, Dan?

20:28.495 --> 20:30.597
Thick thick.
Want one?

20:30.697 --> 20:32.299
Nope, I'm back on my diet.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.669
You know she's coming back.

20:36.769 --> 20:37.670
Oh, what the hell.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.138
[laughter]

20:39.238 --> 20:41.541
[music playing]

20:41.641 --> 20:43.943
[applause]

20:50.317 --> 20:54.454
OK, there oughta be
a spot right about--

20:54.554 --> 20:55.722
Ah.

20:55.822 --> 20:56.623
--there.

20:56.723 --> 20:58.391
See?

20:58.491 --> 20:59.426
Mark that page.

20:59.526 --> 21:01.027
All right.

21:01.127 --> 21:04.263
Now just relax.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.466
Let all the worries go.

21:06.566 --> 21:08.735
Ah.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.236
That's it.

21:10.337 --> 21:12.038
Oh, all right.

21:12.138 --> 21:15.375
Why don't you tell
me about the trip

21:15.475 --> 21:19.145
that you and Dan
took on the bike?

21:19.245 --> 21:21.581
Oh, it was just
awesome, you know.

21:21.681 --> 21:26.218
There we were, going down the
highway, Dan sitting behind me,

21:26.319 --> 21:29.088
totally helpless,
hoarse from screaming.

21:29.188 --> 21:32.359
There, now all those
muscles are lose.

21:32.459 --> 21:33.259
Oh.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.061
All the tension's gone.

21:35.161 --> 21:35.962
Oh.

21:36.062 --> 21:37.430
[horn honking]

21:37.530 --> 21:38.331
Hi, Beck.

21:38.431 --> 21:39.432
Hi, bye!

21:39.532 --> 21:40.667
Where you going?

21:40.767 --> 21:42.034
Out with Mark.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.235
I'm tense.
[door closing]

21:43.336 --> 21:44.737
I'm tense!
[laughter]

21:44.837 --> 21:45.638
OK.

21:45.738 --> 21:46.539
Oh!

21:46.639 --> 21:48.040
