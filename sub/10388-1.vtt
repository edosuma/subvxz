01:28.963 --> 01:33.926
Hello, my name
is Dr. Mercurio Arboria,

01:34.010 --> 01:39.014
and I am the founder
of the Arboria Institute.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.976
It has long been my dream
to find the perfect way

01:43.061 --> 01:45.395
for people to achieve simply...

01:45.480 --> 01:46.814
happiness,

01:46.898 --> 01:48.774
contentment,

01:52.278 --> 01:57.199
These seem to be things
that strangely elude us all,

01:57.283 --> 01:59.785
but it doesn't have
to be that way.

01:59.869 --> 02:04.915
We at Arboria have found a path
to achieve them.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.386
Here at the Institute,

02:17.470 --> 02:20.681
we are in the forefront worldwide

02:20.765 --> 02:22.683
in neuro-psychology

02:22.767 --> 02:26.270
and new therapeutic technologies.

02:26.354 --> 02:28.897
Dr. Barry Nyle,
our head of research,

02:28.982 --> 02:30.232
myself,

02:30.316 --> 02:31.608
and our dedicated team

02:31.693 --> 02:35.195
of herbalists, naturopaths, and healers

02:35.280 --> 02:40.117
have found a way
to make that dream a reality.

02:50.128 --> 02:54.965
Through our unique blend
of benign pharmacology,

02:55.049 --> 02:59.261
sensory therapy,
and energy sculpting,

02:59.345 --> 03:03.056
we can guide you
gently along the path

03:03.141 --> 03:08.645
to a new, better, happier you,

03:08.730 --> 03:10.564
all in the comfortable surroundings

03:10.648 --> 03:13.275
of our state-of-the-art facility

03:13.359 --> 03:16.820
and our award-winning gardens.

03:30.335 --> 03:34.504
We invite you to join us...

03:34.589 --> 03:39.551
and find out for your... self.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.404
Warm her up.

07:11.431 --> 07:15.392
Special 1-1-8-3.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.704
Hello, Elena.

08:19.957 --> 08:22.876
How are you today, hmm?

08:26.464 --> 08:28.340
How are you feeling?

08:49.237 --> 08:51.154
Have you had...

08:52.740 --> 08:54.616
any headaches?

08:58.788 --> 09:00.038
You can tell me.

09:07.588 --> 09:11.633
Your readings are relatively stable.

09:58.222 --> 09:59.556
Very good.

10:02.226 --> 10:04.686
That's very, very good.

10:07.273 --> 10:12.235
You know, this is always
the highlight of my day.

12:21.365 --> 12:22.866
Rosemary.

12:25.035 --> 12:27.078
Rosemary.

12:35.504 --> 12:36.546
Oh.

12:38.716 --> 12:40.800
Barry.

12:40.885 --> 12:44.929
I didn't hear you come in.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.682
Been sleeping long?

12:49.477 --> 12:50.518
No...

12:50.603 --> 12:51.436
Um...

12:52.646 --> 12:54.564
- I wasn't sleeping.
- Hmm.

12:54.648 --> 12:57.776
I was... meditating.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.028
Oh, you were meditating, yeah.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.364
Mm-hmm.

13:06.118 --> 13:07.786
Is everything okay?

13:11.207 --> 13:12.499
Everything's fine.

13:17.755 --> 13:18.671
If you're hungry,

13:18.756 --> 13:22.091
there's some brown rice
and steamed asparagus

13:22.176 --> 13:23.343
in the refrigerator.

13:23.427 --> 13:25.345
Wow, that sounds really good.

13:27.473 --> 13:31.100
No, I'm not hungry...

13:31.185 --> 13:32.268
thank you.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.313
Okay.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.154
It's been a long day.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.617
So, um,

13:47.701 --> 13:52.163
I'm just going to hit the hay early.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.499
Okay.

13:57.586 --> 13:58.795
Good night, Barry.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.632
Good night, Rosemary.

15:06.697 --> 15:08.615
Night Mode.

15:08.699 --> 15:12.327
Rest peacefully and reflect.

16:59.268 --> 17:02.270
Aah-ah-ah!

18:02.414 --> 18:03.748
I am so sorry

18:03.832 --> 18:06.793
that you were never able
to meet your mother.

18:26.230 --> 18:30.066
She was a very beautiful woman.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.460
She was a very desirable woman.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.673
Oh...

19:01.974 --> 19:04.183
Hey, would you, uh...

19:04.268 --> 19:06.769
would you like to have a photo of her?

19:07.813 --> 19:09.063
Would you like that?

19:17.781 --> 19:21.742
Because you may just find one
in your room, hmm.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.134
You know, you are looking more

19:38.218 --> 19:41.095
and more like your mother every day.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.384
You look tired today.

23:51.054 --> 23:54.807
It's easy to become disillusioned

23:55.976 --> 23:59.895
when you don't know who you are...

24:01.314 --> 24:03.274
or what you are.

24:08.405 --> 24:10.656
I know who I am.

24:14.661 --> 24:17.621
That's what gives me my confidence...

24:19.416 --> 24:21.584
and my power.

24:30.343 --> 24:33.179
And I know who you are, too, Elena.

24:43.106 --> 24:47.526
I can guide you towards that achievement...

24:50.947 --> 24:52.615
to find your inner strength

24:54.493 --> 24:56.577
and your inner power.

25:05.420 --> 25:08.130
We all have other forms...

25:13.345 --> 25:15.679
and your inner self...

25:20.185 --> 25:22.937
needs another to complete it.

25:27.150 --> 25:28.526
I...

25:30.695 --> 25:34.281
can help you do that.

25:42.707 --> 25:44.166
Oh...

25:47.671 --> 25:50.047
You just...

25:52.425 --> 25:54.718
have to let me...

26:13.780 --> 26:15.197
I...

26:17.450 --> 26:18.993
want...

26:21.371 --> 26:23.539
to see...

26:24.708 --> 26:26.083
my...

26:28.795 --> 26:31.338
father.

26:38.638 --> 26:41.932
Oh.

26:46.062 --> 26:47.938
Please.

26:53.737 --> 26:59.199
Oh, Elena. Elena, Elena, Elena.

27:00.410 --> 27:03.495
Elena, you know you can't.

27:04.998 --> 27:08.542
You're a very sick girl, Elena.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.628
You're not well.

27:12.047 --> 27:14.131
This...

27:14.215 --> 27:16.175
world...

27:16.259 --> 27:18.802
is in chaos, Elena.

27:21.056 --> 27:22.723
These are...

27:24.976 --> 27:27.978
times of, uh, great uncertainty

27:28.063 --> 27:30.189
and terrible danger.

27:34.402 --> 27:37.404
And you are not ready.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.991
You're just not well.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.374
Don't worry, Elena,

27:50.710 --> 27:53.671
you'll see him again one day.

27:54.839 --> 27:56.548
I promise.

29:23.928 --> 29:26.388
Piece of shit.

30:30.995 --> 30:32.621
What?

31:20.420 --> 31:22.462
Rosemary.

31:41.482 --> 31:42.482
Yeah.

31:57.206 --> 31:58.957
We do have a system in place.

32:03.463 --> 32:08.759
Yes, a comprehensive list
has been compiled.

32:13.932 --> 32:16.224
Mm-hmm. I see.

32:26.819 --> 32:28.528
That's fine.

32:56.599 --> 32:58.266
Rosemary,

32:58.351 --> 33:00.185
why don't you answer
the fucking phone?

36:00.825 --> 36:01.950
Margo.

36:02.034 --> 36:03.994
Yes, Dr. Nyle?

36:06.164 --> 36:07.164
It's come to my...

36:09.083 --> 36:13.128
attention, Margo...

36:13.504 --> 36:15.672
Yes, Dr. Nyle?

36:16.716 --> 36:19.801
It's come to my attention that...

36:20.928 --> 36:27.851
Elena may be hiding an illicit object

36:27.935 --> 36:29.394
from us.

36:29.854 --> 36:30.937
Oh, really?

36:31.022 --> 36:33.231
Mm-hmm.

36:33.316 --> 36:34.608
So...

36:36.402 --> 36:38.570
Keep your eyes peeled.

36:39.447 --> 36:41.114
Yes, Dr. Nyle, I certainly will.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.282
Good.

36:43.534 --> 36:44.701
Very good.

36:44.785 --> 36:46.286
Oh, Dr. Nyle?

36:51.626 --> 36:53.126
Yeah.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.212
Uh, how do you think

36:55.296 --> 36:59.090
she would have come
into possession of the object?

36:59.175 --> 37:01.384
I don't know, Margo.

37:01.469 --> 37:04.221
I don't know.

37:05.890 --> 37:07.599
But I'm looking into it.

37:21.197 --> 37:22.614
Day Mode.

37:22.698 --> 37:25.992
Every sunrise brings a new tomorrow.

37:29.789 --> 37:31.373
Good morning.

37:36.629 --> 37:39.214
Hope you're hungry.
Looks better than usual today.

37:43.469 --> 37:46.179
What have you got there,
a special picture?

37:49.934 --> 37:52.018
Let me see.

37:53.938 --> 37:56.356
Oh, come on, I'm just curious.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.283
That wasn't so hard, now, was it?

38:08.494 --> 38:10.203
Who is this?

38:20.423 --> 38:21.715
Is it your mother?

38:25.177 --> 38:26.344
Where is she?

38:32.143 --> 38:33.727
Did she die?

38:41.027 --> 38:42.777
Good.

38:54.540 --> 38:56.666
Enjoy your dinner.

39:39.293 --> 39:41.127
Stop.

39:41.212 --> 39:43.630
Please stop.

48:34.870 --> 48:36.203
Mercurio.

48:38.582 --> 48:39.916
Are you awake?

48:55.182 --> 48:56.390
Dr. Arboria.

49:02.272 --> 49:03.397
Barry?

49:05.943 --> 49:11.405
B-Barry, is that you, my friend?

49:15.577 --> 49:18.412
Yes, Dr. Arboria, it's me.

49:19.331 --> 49:22.708
Ah, oh...

49:22.793 --> 49:24.669
Wonderful.

49:27.130 --> 49:33.636
Come closer so I can see you.

49:47.484 --> 49:53.197
It's wonderful to see you again.

49:55.242 --> 50:00.913
You're looking well, my friend.

50:03.750 --> 50:05.710
Thank you, Dr. Arboria.

50:08.171 --> 50:09.338
So are you.

50:09.423 --> 50:14.552
Oh, Barry,

50:14.636 --> 50:16.178
there's...

50:17.389 --> 50:24.520
no need to flatter an old man.

50:27.691 --> 50:30.860
I know I-I've...

50:32.237 --> 50:35.281
seen better days.

50:38.326 --> 50:40.077
Besides...

50:42.873 --> 50:50.254
the trappings of the mortal world are...

50:53.216 --> 50:56.135
but a distraction,

50:56.219 --> 50:57.720
wouldn't you say?

50:59.056 --> 51:01.849
Of course, Dr. Arboria.

51:01.933 --> 51:03.059
Yes.

51:05.771 --> 51:09.690
What really matters...

51:12.110 --> 51:16.822
the part of ourselves

51:16.907 --> 51:21.368
we must nurture the most...

51:26.166 --> 51:28.375
is here.

51:29.753 --> 51:31.587
I couldn't agree more.

51:33.632 --> 51:38.052
Would you mind...

51:45.477 --> 51:48.521
assisting me?

51:52.234 --> 51:54.985
Of course, Dr. Arboria.

52:03.745 --> 52:11.745
Aren't these videos of the nature,
ha, beautiful, Barry?

52:16.258 --> 52:20.719
They make me remember a simpler time.

52:22.222 --> 52:24.557
Yes, Dr. Arboria.

52:28.937 --> 52:30.771
Me too.

53:01.970 --> 53:03.637
You are about to embark

53:03.722 --> 53:05.222
on a great journey.

53:09.019 --> 53:11.979
Are you ready, my friend?

53:17.444 --> 53:19.111
I am ready.

53:47.057 --> 53:49.225
Good luck.

53:54.940 --> 53:56.273
Thank you.

55:05.802 --> 55:12.099
Bring home the mother lode, Barry,

55:12.183 --> 55:15.019
Barry, Barry, Barry.

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:38.610
Your mother's reabsorption
into the cycle of life

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:41.279
won't be for nothing,
my darling Elena.

01:01:43.783 --> 01:01:48.370
You will be the dawning of a new era

01:01:48.454 --> 01:01:51.331
for the human race

01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:53.166
and the human soul.

01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:59.548
Let the new age
of enlightenment begin.

01:03:40.107 --> 01:03:41.566
No, Barry,

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:45.070
I don't like to see the...

01:03:45.154 --> 01:03:46.655
on my arm.

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:52.077
Of course.

01:04:05.716 --> 01:04:11.555
How is my darling Elena?

01:04:15.393 --> 01:04:17.269
Well, Dr. Arboria.

01:04:19.438 --> 01:04:21.106
She's very well.

01:04:24.235 --> 01:04:26.027
That's wonderful.

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:30.073
Thank you.

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:37.330
Are you ready?

01:04:39.792 --> 01:04:41.710
Yes, yes.

01:05:10.823 --> 01:05:16.119
Oh, that's wonderful, Barry.

01:05:16.203 --> 01:05:18.580
Yes.

01:05:18.664 --> 01:05:19.915
That's so...

01:05:22.543 --> 01:05:25.003
wonderful.

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:34.220
Isn't it...

01:05:34.305 --> 01:05:36.222
beautiful?

01:05:37.975 --> 01:05:39.392
Yes.

01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:43.146
It is.

01:06:16.514 --> 01:06:18.682
The dormant volcano,

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:22.727
Haleakala Crater.

01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:25.605
Mark Tain described sunrise here

01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:29.609
as "the sublimest spectacle
I have ever witnessed."

01:06:33.781 --> 01:06:36.783
To the west of Maui lies Molokai.

01:06:38.911 --> 01:06:41.997
Except for a few beautiful resort hotels,

01:06:42.081 --> 01:06:44.708
the modern world
has touched Molokai less

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:48.336
than any of the other
vacation islands.

01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:11.651
Aloha means welcome.

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:16.448
It also means love...

01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:21.661
and all too soon...

01:07:27.334 --> 01:07:30.336
farewell.

01:08:01.994 --> 01:08:03.161
Rocket launchers,

01:08:03.245 --> 01:08:06.289
while the Soviets have produced
more than 13,000,

01:08:06.373 --> 01:08:09.417
a staggering 14-to-1 ratio.

01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:11.628
They didn't stop
when their forces exceeded

01:08:11.712 --> 01:08:14.672
all requirements of a legitimate
defensive capability,

01:08:14.757 --> 01:08:16.381
and they haven't stopped now.

01:08:16.466 --> 01:08:19.344
But today they're building weapons

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:22.889
as sophisticated
and modern as our own.

01:08:22.973 --> 01:08:27.143
As the Soviets have increased
their military power,

01:08:27.228 --> 01:08:29.979
they've been emboldened
to extend that power.

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:32.189
They're spreading
their military influence

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:35.193
in ways that can directly
challenge our vital interests

01:08:35.277 --> 01:08:37.153
and those of our allies.

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:38.863
The following aerial photographs,

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:41.366
most of them secret until now,

01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:43.576
illustrate this point in a crucial area

01:08:43.661 --> 01:08:45.495
very close to home...

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:35.123
The Devil's Teardrop.

01:11:38.794 --> 01:11:40.670
Barry?

01:11:41.797 --> 01:11:43.298
Barry!

01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:10.283
Oh.

01:12:10.367 --> 01:12:13.369
Barry, you startled me.

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:17.582
I thought you were an intruder.

01:12:23.589 --> 01:12:25.381
What are you doing?

01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:33.973
Barry,

01:12:34.058 --> 01:12:37.352
you're not wearing your appliances.

01:12:42.232 --> 01:12:44.150
I don't want to wear them any more.

01:12:49.823 --> 01:12:50.698
But...

01:12:52.409 --> 01:12:56.954
It's just you haven't let me see you...

01:12:58.707 --> 01:13:01.376
without them in a long time.

01:13:13.013 --> 01:13:15.390
Where did you get that outfit?

01:13:20.729 --> 01:13:24.399
Has something happened?

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:43.292
Sometimes...

01:13:45.587 --> 01:13:49.257
Sometimes I... l forget...

01:13:50.843 --> 01:13:53.219
how hard it is for you.

01:13:58.934 --> 01:14:00.726
I'm sorry.

01:14:02.604 --> 01:14:05.189
I...

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:08.067
I...I should have

01:14:09.027 --> 01:14:13.614
been there for you more.

01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:25.126
Barry?

01:14:28.672 --> 01:14:31.048
Are... Are you okay?

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:59.494
I...I'm not...

01:15:02.664 --> 01:15:06.417
I'm... I'm not... I'm not okay.

01:15:14.009 --> 01:15:16.719
I went to another world, Rosemary.

01:15:19.932 --> 01:15:25.269
I see what others cannot see.

01:15:32.277 --> 01:15:33.361
Please.

01:15:34.238 --> 01:15:38.783
I looked into the eye of the god.

01:15:40.661 --> 01:15:42.954
It looked right back through me.

01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:45.164
It looked through everything.

01:15:47.501 --> 01:15:48.960
Rosemary,

01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:54.757
it was so, so, so beautiful.

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:00.846
Like a black rainbow...

01:16:05.477 --> 01:16:07.436
and it chose me.

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:10.856
It chose

01:16:10.941 --> 01:16:16.070
to reveal itself to me.

01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:30.126
You're nothing.

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:35.089
You're less than nothing.

01:16:35.173 --> 01:16:39.594
Just... spit in the wind.

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:43.556
Let go of me.

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:46.017
I'm not going to let you go.

01:16:58.947 --> 01:17:01.407
I'm going to set you free.

01:33:57.381 --> 01:34:01.926
Elena...

01:34:02.011 --> 01:34:03.611
Elena?

01:34:08.976 --> 01:34:13.480
Elena?!

01:36:16.145 --> 01:36:19.314
You are doing so good.

01:39:13.364 --> 01:39:15.490
Julie comes walking up, and, um...

01:39:15.574 --> 01:39:16.991
like, I can tell just by looking at her

01:39:17.076 --> 01:39:18.201
she totally, fuckin',

01:39:18.285 --> 01:39:19.619
she totally wants to pork me.

01:39:19.703 --> 01:39:21.829
Oh, you're so full of shit.

01:39:21.914 --> 01:39:26.292
What would she want
with that two-inch little blood bat?

01:39:30.047 --> 01:39:31.547
Fuck, my left ball hurts a little.

01:39:35.135 --> 01:39:36.511
I gotta take a leak.

01:39:36.595 --> 01:39:38.763
Thanks for telling me.

01:39:38.847 --> 01:39:40.598
Get bent, you fat fuck!

01:40:08.127 --> 01:40:09.252
Ohh...

01:40:24.059 --> 01:40:25.768
What the fuck?

01:40:45.497 --> 01:40:47.097
Yo!

01:40:59.678 --> 01:41:01.278
Yo?

01:41:38.592 --> 01:41:40.259
Where is she?

01:41:40.344 --> 01:41:45.973
I don't know.

01:41:46.975 --> 01:41:47.975
I don't...

01:41:49.394 --> 01:41:51.646
I don't know.

01:41:53.482 --> 01:41:55.149
I don't know.

01:41:59.154 --> 01:42:00.863
You fucked her.

01:42:00.948 --> 01:42:03.241
No, I...

01:42:06.954 --> 01:42:08.538
No...

01:42:09.665 --> 01:42:11.499
No, I didn't.

01:42:11.583 --> 01:42:13.668
No, I didn't fuck...

01:42:15.754 --> 01:42:17.171
You fucked her.

01:42:17.256 --> 01:42:19.465
No, I didn't! I didn't.

01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:20.424
You fucked her.

01:42:20.509 --> 01:42:21.676
No...

01:42:23.053 --> 01:42:25.805
No...

01:42:25.889 --> 01:42:26.931
You fucked her.

01:42:27.015 --> 01:42:27.974
No, no!

01:42:28.058 --> 01:42:29.475
Shut up!

01:43:27.701 --> 01:43:30.411
You look so beautiful when you sleep.

01:43:34.166 --> 01:43:37.001
Sweet, sweet Elena.

01:43:41.423 --> 01:43:44.008
Well, I found you.

01:43:47.512 --> 01:43:49.347
It's okay.

01:43:53.602 --> 01:43:54.977
Come to me, okay?

01:43:56.897 --> 01:43:58.856
Elena, come on.

01:43:58.941 --> 01:43:59.774
Come here.

01:43:59.858 --> 01:44:01.943
Come on.

01:44:02.027 --> 01:44:05.196
Elena, come to me.

01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:07.740
Elena?

01:44:09.076 --> 01:44:10.660
Elena.

01:44:13.705 --> 01:44:15.539
Come to me.

01:44:15.624 --> 01:44:17.291
Come.

01:44:17.376 --> 01:44:19.418
Come to me.

01:44:25.634 --> 01:44:27.134
