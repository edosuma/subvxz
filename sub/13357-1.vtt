I don't have anything

Let me see. Nope, all clear.

00:21.221 --> 00:24.356
Honey, you look so handsome.

00:24.357 --> 00:26.317
She's going to have a great
time with you tonight.

00:26.341 --> 00:26.892
You'll see.

00:26.893 --> 00:28.333
Oh, and I want a
picture of you two.

00:28.357 --> 00:30.162
- Mom, no.
- Oh, come on, please.

00:30.163 --> 00:31.163
Just one.

00:31.164 --> 00:33.699
Okay, uh, but you promised

00:33.700 --> 00:35.401
you'd let me walk to
the door by myself.

00:35.402 --> 00:37.436
I know, I know. I'll be
right here in the car.

Hi, Annie.

01:14.808 --> 01:17.776
Harold, you're so dressed up.

01:17.777 --> 01:20.813
Are you trying to
make me look bad?

01:20.814 --> 01:22.815
That was a joke.

01:22.816 --> 01:25.551
This is for you.

01:25.552 --> 01:29.855
Thanks. It's beautiful.

01:29.856 --> 01:31.790
So are you ready to go?

01:31.791 --> 01:34.927
Yeah, I told everybody to meet
us out in front of the gym.

01:34.928 --> 01:38.096
Uh, everybody?

01:38.097 --> 01:40.866
I invited a bunch of
friends to come with us.

01:40.867 --> 01:43.335
I thought it'd be fun if
we went as a big group.

01:43.336 --> 01:45.437
Don't you think?

01:45.438 --> 01:47.206
Yeah.

01:47.207 --> 01:48.447
Okay, you two. Move in together.

01:48.471 --> 01:50.506
Move in.

01:52.912 --> 01:56.849
Smile, Harold.

02:01.221 --> 02:03.155
So the software we
set you up with

02:03.156 --> 02:04.790
will issue all of your invoices.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.191
It keeps everything organized,

02:06.192 --> 02:08.193
so when tax time
comes, it's a snap.

02:08.193 --> 02:11.163
Saves time for me
and money for you.

02:11.164 --> 02:14.199
Um, where do I enter
that information?

02:14.200 --> 02:15.634
Right, Claire has volunteered

02:15.635 --> 02:17.135
to be my billing department.

02:17.136 --> 02:19.204
Well, I can walk you
through it if you want.

02:19.205 --> 02:20.672
You just have to
remember to enter

02:20.673 --> 02:21.940
all your setup expenses

02:21.941 --> 02:23.509
because they're all deductible.

02:23.510 --> 02:25.544
Will do. Thank you.

02:25.545 --> 02:27.279
Sure.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.914
These are beautiful.

02:28.915 --> 02:30.516
Are they all the
same photographer?

02:30.517 --> 02:32.751
Uh, yes. They are.

02:32.752 --> 02:34.419
Actually, it's me.

02:34.420 --> 02:37.022
Really?

02:37.023 --> 02:38.783
Well, listen. We really
appreciate your help.

02:38.807 --> 02:40.158
- Thank you, Harold.
- Yeah.

02:40.159 --> 02:41.293
Yes.

02:41.294 --> 02:42.895
Uh, Steve and I were thinking,

02:42.896 --> 02:45.096
we're having a party next
Saturday for Megan's birthday.

02:45.120 --> 02:48.066
I'm a big girl. I'm turning six.

02:48.067 --> 02:49.268
Oh, wow.

02:49.269 --> 02:50.969
And we're just having
some friends over,

02:50.970 --> 02:53.539
but we'd love you to join
us if you're not busy.

02:53.540 --> 02:55.173
Yeah, thanks. I'll drop by.

02:55.174 --> 02:57.442
Great. Great.

02:57.443 --> 02:59.177
Um, my sister Annie is in town,

02:59.178 --> 03:01.713
you two were in the same
high-school class together,

03:01.714 --> 03:02.748
weren't you?

03:02.749 --> 03:06.552
Yeah. Yeah, I remember Annie.

03:06.553 --> 03:08.754
Um, how is she doing?

03:08.755 --> 03:11.156
You can find out for yourself.

03:11.157 --> 03:12.724
Uh, Saturday. 2:00.

03:12.725 --> 03:16.596
- Thank you.
- Yeah, thanks again.

03:18.831 --> 03:21.400
Yes, yes.

03:21.401 --> 03:23.368
I'll talk to him
about it right now.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.370
And then I'll put
her name and number

03:25.371 --> 03:28.173
right in front our boy,
and I'll watch him score.

03:28.174 --> 03:29.374
Bye, hon.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.243
- Who's going to score?
- You are.

03:31.244 --> 03:32.811
So when's our next
round of golf?

03:32.812 --> 03:34.713
Do you really think we
should keep playing?

03:34.714 --> 03:36.448
We have to be the
worst golfers ever.

03:36.449 --> 03:39.117
We quit by the sixth
hole or lunchtime,

03:39.118 --> 03:40.285
whichever comes first.

03:40.286 --> 03:43.488
We should come up with
a new sport like...

03:43.489 --> 03:45.357
Miniature golf or bowling.

03:45.358 --> 03:46.491
Ooh, bowling. I like bowling.

03:49.028 --> 03:53.066
Guess who just walked in?

03:57.170 --> 03:58.503
And she saw me.

03:58.504 --> 04:00.405
You should go talk to her.

04:00.406 --> 04:02.608
This isn't the first time
that she smiled at you.

04:02.609 --> 04:04.610
- She likes you.
- I don't think so.

04:04.611 --> 04:06.612
See, there you go, hiding
under a rock again.

04:06.613 --> 04:08.113
Look, you know as well as I do,

04:08.114 --> 04:10.749
every time I ask a woman
out, it ends in disaster.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.351
Thank you.

04:12.352 --> 04:14.453
Why do you think that is?

04:14.454 --> 04:16.355
I don't know.

04:16.356 --> 04:19.257
But it's always the same
whether I'm set up by friends,

04:19.257 --> 04:22.361
or internet dating, or
matchmaking services.

04:22.362 --> 04:23.395
Nothing works.

04:23.396 --> 04:24.963
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:24.964 --> 04:26.698
Maybe it's not the
meeting-people part

04:26.699 --> 04:27.933
that you have a problem with.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.735
Let's be honest.

04:29.736 --> 04:32.004
Socializing is not
your strong point.

04:32.005 --> 04:35.807
Yeah, the whole thing
is just so frustrating.

04:35.808 --> 04:38.944
Have you ever heard
of a dating coach?

04:38.945 --> 04:40.479
A what?

04:40.480 --> 04:41.580
A dating coach.

04:41.581 --> 04:43.615
Denise and I saw it on
TV the other night.

04:43.616 --> 04:46.618
They're kind of like a
private teacher you hire

04:46.619 --> 04:47.719
to teach you how to date.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.521
Dating coach.

04:49.522 --> 04:51.490
Is there really such a thing?

04:51.491 --> 04:52.624
Yeah.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.993
And I found someone
in the city for you.

04:54.994 --> 04:56.862
She's got a bunch of clients,

04:56.863 --> 04:59.064
and a lot of people
are trying it.

04:59.065 --> 05:00.932
Willy, come on.

05:00.933 --> 05:04.936
I mean, this is
just embarrassing.

05:04.937 --> 05:08.141
I couldn't do it. It's...
it's too weird.

05:17.717 --> 05:22.387
So I've never been to a
dating coach before.

05:22.388 --> 05:24.956
My friend Willy, the
guy who called,

05:24.957 --> 05:27.225
thought you might be
able to help me out.

05:27.226 --> 05:28.560
Well, that's why I'm here.

05:28.561 --> 05:30.595
To help people stop
making mistakes

05:30.596 --> 05:34.566
in the modern dating world and
attract their perfect mate.

05:34.567 --> 05:35.701
Oh, great.

05:35.702 --> 05:38.737
Um, how do we get started?

05:38.738 --> 05:42.841
Well, what we need to
do is schedule you

05:42.842 --> 05:46.478
for a series of intensive
one-on-one sessions.

05:46.479 --> 05:49.548
During this time, I
am going to mold you.

05:49.549 --> 05:53.118
I'm going to teach you
the skills you will use

05:53.119 --> 05:57.389
to attract and hold onto
that special someone.

05:57.390 --> 06:00.525
Wow. How many
sessions do we have?

06:00.526 --> 06:03.295
Well, we have a number of
packages to choose from.

06:03.296 --> 06:06.665
I recommend you go with
our Diamond package.

06:06.666 --> 06:10.635
It's the longest and
most intensive.

06:10.636 --> 06:12.804
Wow, it's expensive.

06:12.805 --> 06:14.639
Cost should be no
obstacle when it comes

06:14.640 --> 06:16.641
to your future
happiness, Harold.

06:16.642 --> 06:18.143
And don't worry,

06:18.144 --> 06:21.680
we have payment plans and
accept all major credit cards.

06:21.681 --> 06:26.718
And just a little paperwork
for you to sign.

06:26.719 --> 06:30.088
I think, um, I just...

06:30.089 --> 06:35.294
I should take some time
to think this over.

06:54.914 --> 06:57.449
You made it.

06:57.450 --> 06:59.184
Hey, here you go.
Thanks for having me.

06:59.185 --> 07:01.620
Oh, this is so sweet.

07:01.621 --> 07:05.191
Come on in. Everyone's
through here.

07:07.293 --> 07:08.960
Smile, Harold.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.301
Annie, look who's here.

07:16.302 --> 07:18.537
Harold, you remember Annie?

07:18.538 --> 07:21.473
Sure. Hi.

07:21.474 --> 07:25.143
Hi. Hi.

07:25.144 --> 07:27.179
It's so great to see you again

07:27.180 --> 07:28.613
after all these years.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.215
Yeah.

07:30.216 --> 07:31.383
Harold...

07:31.384 --> 07:32.384
- White.
- White.

07:32.385 --> 07:33.785
Of course.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.821
How have you been?

07:35.822 --> 07:38.990
Fine, thanks. How have you been?

07:38.991 --> 07:40.325
Ah. Ah, you know.

07:40.326 --> 07:42.928
Living the high life,
hanging in there.

07:42.929 --> 07:44.362
All that good stuff.

07:44.363 --> 07:47.633
Yeah.

07:49.468 --> 07:51.503
So can I get you a
drink or something?

07:51.504 --> 07:55.006
- Yeah, that would be great.
- Okay.

07:57.176 --> 07:59.611
And then after college,

07:59.612 --> 08:02.581
I move the whopping-hours
drive away to the city.

08:02.582 --> 08:04.182
I've always loved the city.

08:04.183 --> 08:06.518
And then I started
my own business.

08:06.519 --> 08:07.853
I'm an event planner,

08:07.854 --> 08:09.187
like, I put parties together.

08:09.188 --> 08:11.890
You know, decorating
everything and organizing.

08:11.891 --> 08:14.593
- Did you do all of this?
- Yeah, I did.

08:14.594 --> 08:17.295
It's amazing what you can do
with some scraps of fabric

08:17.296 --> 08:19.831
and, you know, a hot glue
gun and some colored paper.

08:19.832 --> 08:22.467
Wow. You're really talented.

08:22.468 --> 08:23.802
Thank you.

08:23.803 --> 08:28.039
Although it's been a
really tough line of work

08:28.040 --> 08:29.107
to break into.

08:29.108 --> 08:31.243
Anyway, enough about me.
What about you?

08:31.244 --> 08:34.279
Claire said you're helping
Steve set up his body shop?

08:34.280 --> 08:35.981
Uh, yeah.

08:35.982 --> 08:37.515
I'm sorry. And what
is it you do again?

08:37.515 --> 08:41.519
I run my own accounting firm
and do some consulting.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.855
- Small business, mostly.
- Yeah.

08:43.856 --> 08:45.223
I'm also a photographer,

08:45.224 --> 08:46.984
but that's really just
on the side, you know.

08:47.008 --> 08:49.676
No, that's great. Good for you.

08:51.330 --> 08:53.064
You know, on the
way over here...

08:54.200 --> 08:56.334
I was thinking about
that dance we went to.

08:56.335 --> 08:58.770
What... what dance is this?

08:58.771 --> 09:03.241
In freshmen year of high
school, homecoming.

09:03.242 --> 09:06.311
I couldn't drive, so
my mother took us.

09:06.312 --> 09:08.380
Do you remember?

09:08.381 --> 09:10.749
She took that picture
of us together.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.351
Of course.

09:13.352 --> 09:15.954
Yeah. Oh, right.

09:15.955 --> 09:19.357
We had such a good time.
Didn't we?

09:19.358 --> 09:20.926
Yeah.

09:20.927 --> 09:23.129
Yeah.

09:27.566 --> 09:29.801
Good night, birthday girl.

09:29.802 --> 09:33.706
Sweet dreams.

09:46.652 --> 09:48.086
She went out like a light.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.855
Thank you for everything.

09:50.856 --> 09:53.325
The party looked fantastic.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.927
Everybody said so.

09:55.928 --> 09:59.164
So I talked to your friend
Harold like you asked me to.

09:59.165 --> 10:00.965
I was just worried he'd
be left alone all day.

10:00.989 --> 10:02.367
He's a nice guy, right?

10:02.368 --> 10:05.403
Eh, kind of blah, but
yeah, he's nice.

10:05.404 --> 10:07.439
You promise you aren't
trying to set me up, right?

10:07.440 --> 10:08.840
No.

10:08.841 --> 10:13.244
Besides, you're going out
with that Brad or Brian...

10:13.245 --> 10:14.312
Brady.

10:14.313 --> 10:16.982
And no, that was
like, five guys ago.

10:16.983 --> 10:18.616
So who are you dating this week?

10:18.617 --> 10:20.185
Uh, well, no one yet,

10:20.186 --> 10:23.254
but hey, at least I've worked my
ways through the "B" s, right?

10:23.255 --> 10:25.857
- Mm.
- No, I'm actually...

10:25.858 --> 10:31.062
I just got a lot on
my plate right now.

10:31.063 --> 10:33.098
Speaking of which,

10:33.099 --> 10:37.002
I kind of need to
ask you a favor.

10:37.003 --> 10:39.871
Remember how I said I'd be ready
to move out of here next week?

10:39.872 --> 10:41.239
Yeah.

10:41.240 --> 10:45.343
Well, turns out, um,
trying to find a job

10:45.344 --> 10:48.179
and a place to live in the
city, it's been really tough.

10:48.180 --> 10:51.082
Everything is so expensive.

10:51.083 --> 10:53.318
And I'm wondering how you'd feel

10:53.319 --> 10:56.721
if I could just stay for
a little bit longer.

10:56.722 --> 10:57.722
Please.

10:57.723 --> 11:00.392
Oh, Annie,

11:00.393 --> 11:01.826
you've been here
for four months.

11:01.827 --> 11:02.894
Yeah.

11:02.895 --> 11:04.696
Time flies when
you're having fun?

11:04.697 --> 11:06.831
What happened to getting a job?

11:06.832 --> 11:08.366
I've been looking all over.

11:08.367 --> 11:11.069
There's no openings for
event planners anywhere.

11:11.070 --> 11:12.350
Why don't you do something else?

11:12.351 --> 11:14.271
You know, just for a little
while, pay the bills.

11:14.295 --> 11:18.176
Oh, uh, yeah. Sure, um,

11:18.177 --> 11:20.845
I'll just... I'll get a day job.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.747
Okay.

11:22.748 --> 11:24.682
And in the meantime, I
can baby-sit Megan,

11:24.683 --> 11:27.652
and I-I can do your decorating,

11:27.653 --> 11:29.621
and I'll even do your windows.

11:29.622 --> 11:32.190
You know, you need a backup plan

11:32.191 --> 11:34.726
for this career of yours.

11:34.727 --> 11:39.965
Annie, you're not a kid anymore.

11:53.512 --> 11:55.180
Well, hello, stranger.

11:55.181 --> 11:56.714
It's been a while, huh?

11:56.715 --> 11:58.416
Let me guess, table
for one, right?

11:58.417 --> 11:59.417
Please.

11:59.418 --> 12:01.152
Follow me.

12:01.153 --> 12:02.587
Here, sire.

12:02.588 --> 12:05.090
And okay, so the specials today

12:05.091 --> 12:07.292
are meatloaf and roast chicken.

12:07.293 --> 12:08.927
If I were you,

12:08.928 --> 12:11.596
I'd go with the roast chicken.

12:11.597 --> 12:12.730
Thank you.

12:12.731 --> 12:14.732
Someone will be right with you.

12:14.733 --> 12:18.570
Here's your menu right here.

12:18.571 --> 12:22.307
You gotta be kidding me.

12:22.308 --> 12:23.708
Hi.

12:23.709 --> 12:25.143
You work here?

12:25.144 --> 12:27.645
Yeah. Sure do.

12:27.646 --> 12:30.081
Just started here today.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.717
And I gotta say, so
far, not so good.

12:32.718 --> 12:37.021
My car broke down this morning
on my first day of work,

12:37.022 --> 12:38.056

12:38.057 --> 12:39.357
Thank you.

Sorry to hear that.

ends in an hour,

Megan somewhere,

12:58.978 --> 13:00.011

- Coming right up.

Harold, that's very...
That's very sweet of you.

13:22.735 --> 13:25.503
But I just... I couldn't
ask you to do that.

13:25.504 --> 13:27.405
Right.

13:27.406 --> 13:30.776
Could I?

13:42.988 --> 13:44.222
Thank you.

13:44.223 --> 13:47.392

trained them well.

13:47.393 --> 13:49.727
I don't have a girlfriend.

13:49.728 --> 13:51.896
Not really good at that.

13:51.897 --> 13:53.598
Come on, you can't be that bad.

13:53.599 --> 13:56.734
I'm so bad, my best
friend had to get me

13:56.735 --> 14:00.438
to see a... Specialist.

14:00.439 --> 14:03.841
Specialist for...

14:03.842 --> 14:05.944
A dating coach.

14:05.945 --> 14:08.546
Really?

14:08.547 --> 14:11.583
A dating coach? How did that go?

14:11.584 --> 14:13.751
Uh, it was a disaster.

14:13.752 --> 14:16.421
She was more interested
in making a sale.

14:16.422 --> 14:19.624
Kind of made me feel
like a lost cause.

14:19.625 --> 14:22.861
Nobody's a lost cause, Harold.

14:26.232 --> 14:27.899
I should get going.

14:27.900 --> 14:30.468
Okay.

14:30.469 --> 14:33.137
Well, thanks again for the ride.

14:33.138 --> 14:35.206
Sure.

14:35.207 --> 14:36.908
I'll see you later, okay?

14:36.909 --> 14:39.211
Okay.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.583
How'd you get home?

14:45.584 --> 14:47.885
Harold dropped me off.

14:47.886 --> 14:50.021
Poor guy.

14:50.022 --> 14:52.257
And I thought I had problems.

14:52.258 --> 14:53.291
Ugh.

14:53.292 --> 14:56.761
What a day.

14:56.762 --> 14:58.796
If I were into bubble baths,

14:58.797 --> 15:00.765
this would be the
time to take one.

15:00.766 --> 15:03.134
Do you have a minute?

15:03.135 --> 15:04.869
Okay, look, I know I
need to pay Steven back

15:04.870 --> 15:06.137
for fixing and towing my car,

15:06.138 --> 15:07.438
and I will have the money to him

15:07.439 --> 15:09.440
right after I get
my next paycheck.

15:09.441 --> 15:11.009
And the one after that...

15:11.010 --> 15:12.644
And the one after that.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.345
Why don't you sit down?

15:14.346 --> 15:16.481
Aw.

15:16.482 --> 15:20.151
- Is this about my dirty room?
- No.

15:20.152 --> 15:21.819
- My dishes in the sink?
- No.

Borrowing your dress
without asking?

15:23.284 --> 15:24.656
No.

That's all I know about.
What have you got on me?

15:27.493 --> 15:31.929
Annie, your staying here...

15:31.930 --> 15:34.299
I don't think it's a
good idea anymore.

15:34.300 --> 15:35.600
What?

15:35.601 --> 15:37.835
I've been giving this
a lot of thought,

15:37.836 --> 15:41.239
and frankly, I feel like I'm
helping you escape reality.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.174
Of course not.

15:43.175 --> 15:44.609
I escape reality all on my own.

15:44.610 --> 15:45.610
Pew.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.279

I know I'm a pain,
but I promise you,

15:51.917 --> 15:53.251
this is not going to be forever.

15:53.252 --> 15:55.687
I just need to buy myself
a little bit of time.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.390
the way we want them to.

15:59.391 --> 16:01.926
It's not always about
getting a free ride.

16:01.927 --> 16:03.928
What's that supposed to mean?

16:03.929 --> 16:06.898
At some point, we all
have to grow up.

16:06.899 --> 16:10.135
You need to move out and
get your own place.

16:12.905 --> 16:15.406
Even your own family
won't bail you out?

16:15.407 --> 16:17.742
So much for "blood is
thicker than water," right?

16:17.743 --> 16:19.944
Sorry. I mean, you
could stay with me,

16:19.945 --> 16:22.880
but my place is, like,
as big as your shoe.

16:22.881 --> 16:24.682
Oh, thank you,

16:24.683 --> 16:27.018
but now I have to
find another job.

16:27.019 --> 16:28.419
And it has to be
something flexible

16:28.420 --> 16:30.054
so that I can keep this one.

16:30.055 --> 16:32.957
- How am I supposed to do that?
- I don't know.

16:32.958 --> 16:34.992
Maybe you can try to
win big at Vegas.

16:34.993 --> 16:36.327
You could.

16:36.328 --> 16:39.063

22:00.218 --> 22:03.854
It's time to become one
of the few, the proud,

22:03.855 --> 22:05.322
a heartbreaker.

22:05.323 --> 22:07.091
This is great.

22:07.092 --> 22:08.926
Okay, stand right there.

22:08.927 --> 22:11.896
- Okay.
- Now, first things first.

22:11.897 --> 22:16.067
You start dating long before
you say word one to a woman.

22:16.068 --> 22:17.035
- Really?
- Really.

22:17.036 --> 22:19.603
Hmm.

22:19.604 --> 22:22.239
They key ingredient
to successful dating

22:22.240 --> 22:23.974
is self-confidence.

22:23.975 --> 22:27.912
I should be seeing lots
of confidence in you.

22:27.913 --> 22:31.115
And right now, I'm not.

22:31.116 --> 22:33.918
Yeah.

22:33.919 --> 22:35.959
Okay, Harold, if you're going
to be my lump of clay,

22:35.983 --> 22:39.757
I need you to be a
little less of a lump.

22:39.758 --> 22:41.392
Okay?

22:41.393 --> 22:43.227
Okay.

22:43.228 --> 22:46.464
I want you to look
at your reflection

22:46.465 --> 22:50.568
and tell me some of
your finer qualities.

22:50.569 --> 22:52.536
Uh...

22:52.537 --> 22:56.607
Okay, tell me one of
your finer qualities.

22:56.608 --> 22:58.242
Um...

22:58.243 --> 23:01.278
Just hang on for a second.
I'm thinking.

23:01.279 --> 23:03.614
♪ The first night we met ♪

23:03.615 --> 23:05.616
Harold, you're scaring me here.

23:05.617 --> 23:11.355
Come on, what do you see
when you look at yourself?

23:11.356 --> 23:14.959
I see the guy who stayed home

23:14.960 --> 23:17.495
every Friday night
doing his homework.

23:17.496 --> 23:20.998
What? What are you
talking about?

23:20.999 --> 23:24.935
Harold, that was
a long time ago.

23:24.936 --> 23:27.772
Your awkward years are over.

23:27.773 --> 23:30.908
Yeah, but I don't think
I've changed all that much.

23:30.909 --> 23:32.843
- Are you serious?
- Uh-huh.

23:32.844 --> 23:37.148
Wow. That's crazy.

23:37.149 --> 23:38.415
Yeah.

23:38.416 --> 23:41.886
You know, I think this
whole dating-coach thing

23:41.887 --> 23:44.455
- was a bad idea, so I'm gonna...
- Nonsense.

23:44.456 --> 23:46.457
Being attractive

23:46.458 --> 23:51.262
starts with having a positive
attitude about yourself.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.497
Look at your reflection,
and let me hear you say,

23:53.498 --> 23:54.565
"I look good."

23:54.566 --> 23:56.634
Come on, say it. "I look good."

23:56.635 --> 23:59.403
Let me hear you.

24:02.374 --> 24:03.707
I look good.

24:03.708 --> 24:06.644
Louder, and like you
mean it, please.

24:06.645 --> 24:09.013
You know, this is embarrassing.

24:09.014 --> 24:10.447
Nobody is even around.

24:10.448 --> 24:13.351
- I look good.
- With confidence!

24:15.253 --> 24:16.520
I look good.

24:16.521 --> 24:20.424
Okay. That's better.

24:20.425 --> 24:21.625
Harold...

24:21.626 --> 24:25.029
Nobody is going to
notice you in this world

24:25.030 --> 24:27.531
unless you feel like you're
worth being noticed.

24:27.532 --> 24:29.767
You've got to get
rid of this idea

24:29.768 --> 24:31.802
that you look like
you did back then.

24:31.803 --> 24:34.438
It's not what anyone else sees.

24:34.439 --> 24:36.340
Trust me.

24:36.341 --> 24:38.976
How do we do that?

24:38.977 --> 24:42.246
By bringing out the best in you.

24:42.247 --> 24:44.748
Of course, that means
our first lesson

24:44.749 --> 24:46.789
is going to take a few more
sessions than I thought.

24:46.813 --> 24:48.285
Mm-hmm.

24:48.286 --> 24:49.887
And uh,

24:49.888 --> 24:51.957
how much more is that
going to cost me?

You know what,
it's on the house.

24:59.364 --> 25:03.534
Yeah, let's just call it
some free, extra credit.

Maybe not easy, but
not this hard.

Oh!

Considerate, hard worker,

28:08.920 --> 28:10.954

into better shape

28:10.955 --> 28:13.223
now that the soreness
is wearing off.

28:13.224 --> 28:14.992
That's four.

28:43.621 --> 28:46.557
Oh, I ran into traffic
on the way over.

28:46.558 --> 28:47.991
No, no. Not that.

28:47.992 --> 28:50.594
I mean, your look and...
And your clothes.

28:50.595 --> 28:51.929
And everything.

28:51.930 --> 28:55.365
I started working
with a dating coach.

28:55.366 --> 28:57.801
Why, is that...
Does it look okay?

28:57.802 --> 28:58.869
Dude,

28:58.870 --> 29:00.237
women are going to
be all over you.

29:00.238 --> 29:01.638
Really?

29:01.639 --> 29:04.241
I told you a dating coach
was the way to go.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.510
That place I suggested...
It worked.

29:06.511 --> 29:09.413
No, uh, I found someone
else actually.

29:09.414 --> 29:10.647
I don't know who they are,

29:10.648 --> 29:12.516
but they definitely know
what they're doing.

29:15.453 --> 29:18.422
And they teach golf too.

29:18.423 --> 29:20.824
You know, her
name's Annie Hayes.

29:20.825 --> 29:22.493
I actually went to
high school with her.

29:22.494 --> 29:23.894
And she's a dating coach.

29:23.895 --> 29:26.663
No, she's a party planner
working as a waitress.

29:26.664 --> 29:28.966
It's, um, kind of
hard to explain.

29:28.967 --> 29:30.901
Basically, she needed a job.

29:30.902 --> 29:32.769
Okay, how well do
you know this lady?

29:32.770 --> 29:34.138
Um, not all that well.

29:34.139 --> 29:36.807
We went a high-school
dance together.

29:36.808 --> 29:39.076
It was a long time ago.

29:39.077 --> 29:40.978
Okay, let me see if
I've got this straight.

29:40.979 --> 29:43.280
You hired someone
from high school,

29:43.281 --> 29:45.015
a woman you barely even know

29:45.016 --> 29:46.316
to teach you how to date,

29:46.317 --> 29:48.037
and she's someone who
normally plans parties

29:48.061 --> 29:48.886
for a living?

29:48.887 --> 29:51.555
Yeah.

I thought it'd be
good to, you know,

just throw you right
into the shark tank.

30:48.813 --> 30:49.947
my friend and I go to,

30:49.948 --> 30:53.016
but I've never actually met her.

30:53.017 --> 30:54.885
Hmm.

30:54.886 --> 30:57.654
All right, you need to learn
how to break the ice.

30:57.655 --> 31:02.759
Start a conversation with
someone you don't know.

31:02.760 --> 31:04.661
I'm just going to
warn you right now,

31:04.662 --> 31:06.964
I'm, uh, awful at this.

31:06.965 --> 31:08.045
Okay, don't worry about it.

31:08.069 --> 31:09.533
It... it just takes practice.

31:09.534 --> 31:11.635
I'm going to give
you a few pointers.

31:11.636 --> 31:15.505
Okay, don't use
cheesy pickup lines.

31:15.506 --> 31:17.908
Just don't do it. It
always goes over badly.

31:17.909 --> 31:18.909
Right.

31:18.910 --> 31:21.912
And mostly just be yourself.

31:21.913 --> 31:24.214
What do you mean?

31:24.215 --> 31:26.516
Oh, wow. Uh, okay.

31:26.517 --> 31:29.019
Well, when you see someone
you want to meet,

31:29.020 --> 31:31.955
you just go up to them, and
you say something like,

31:31.956 --> 31:33.924
"hi, I'm Harold.

31:33.925 --> 31:35.805
I wanted to introduce myself.
What's your name?"

31:35.829 --> 31:36.893
It's that easy.

31:36.894 --> 31:39.029
Easy? It's not easy for me.

31:39.030 --> 31:41.431
Hmm...

31:41.432 --> 31:44.668
Okay, see that blonde
at the end of the bar?

31:44.669 --> 31:46.970
That's potential
date number one.

31:46.971 --> 31:50.941
Batter up.

31:50.942 --> 31:52.576
Come on.

31:52.577 --> 31:54.645
Yeah. You can do it.

31:54.646 --> 31:56.714
Take a sip. All right.

32:05.156 --> 32:07.924
Hi. I'm Harold.

32:07.925 --> 32:09.245
Uh, I wanted to
introduce myself.

32:09.269 --> 32:10.460
What's your name?

32:10.461 --> 32:13.563
I'm Amy.

32:13.564 --> 32:14.598
Well, it's um...

32:14.599 --> 32:15.966
Nice to meet you, Amy.

32:15.967 --> 32:20.570
You too.

32:32.150 --> 32:35.453
Oh, my god.

32:40.858 --> 32:42.659
What was that?

32:42.660 --> 32:45.329
Harold, I didn't think I
needed to tell you this,

32:45.330 --> 32:47.397
but after the introduction,

32:47.398 --> 32:49.366
you got to follow it
up with something.

32:49.367 --> 32:51.768
You know, "you look
great tonight."

32:51.769 --> 32:53.236
Do you come here often?"

32:53.237 --> 32:54.371
You make some conversation.

32:54.372 --> 32:56.273
And then of course,
you ask her out.

32:56.274 --> 32:58.709
So remember, it's
one, two, three.

32:58.710 --> 33:00.377
You introduce yourself.

33:00.378 --> 33:01.712
You make some conversation.

33:01.713 --> 33:02.746
You ask her out.

33:02.747 --> 33:04.147
Got it?

33:04.148 --> 33:06.616
I told you, I'm not
very good at this.

33:06.617 --> 33:07.918
Confidence.

33:07.919 --> 33:10.120
You'll get there.

33:10.121 --> 33:14.224
Um, I do think that maybe
we need to throw in

33:14.225 --> 33:16.793
a little more extra credit.

33:16.794 --> 33:21.499
Yeah.

33:22.900 --> 33:28.405
Now, say something to her,
but be sincere about it.

33:28.406 --> 33:33.510
Show her you've really paid
attention to her, yeah?

33:33.511 --> 33:37.047
How about...

33:37.048 --> 33:42.386
You have beautiful eyes.

33:42.387 --> 33:45.021
Good.

33:45.022 --> 33:49.260
That... that felt real.

33:51.929 --> 33:54.464
How are you guys this morning?

33:54.465 --> 33:55.799
Well. You?

33:55.800 --> 33:57.701
Are you going to be here
for dinner tonight?

33:57.702 --> 33:59.002
Nope. Working late.

33:59.003 --> 34:00.537
I thought you worked
the day shift.

34:00.538 --> 34:01.905
For job number one.

34:01.906 --> 34:04.708
- There's a job number two?
- Long story.

34:04.709 --> 34:06.443
Do you need help
finding a place?

34:06.444 --> 34:08.612
Uh, no, thank you. I
can do it myself.

34:08.612 --> 34:10.947
I got to go.

34:10.947 --> 34:13.350
I bet she hasn't even
started looking.

34:13.351 --> 34:17.154
So why is it so important that
Annie move out right now?

34:17.155 --> 34:19.114
Don't you think you're being
a little hard on her?

34:19.139 --> 34:21.858
Steve, she can't just have
a free ride all the time.

34:21.859 --> 34:23.260
I don't get it.

34:23.261 --> 34:25.261
You're more than willing
to help me set my shop up.

34:25.262 --> 34:26.702
Why are you so tough
on your sister?

34:26.726 --> 34:29.699
I'm not. You don't understand.

34:29.699 --> 34:31.668
You sure it's not payback time?

34:31.668 --> 34:33.003
For what?

34:33.004 --> 34:35.739
For resenting her for being
the baby of the family

34:35.739 --> 34:39.509
while you had to be the more
responsible older sister?

34:39.510 --> 34:41.511
It's not that at all.

34:41.512 --> 34:44.414
Really?

34:44.415 --> 34:46.016
All right.

34:46.016 --> 34:48.286
Think about it.

34:51.355 --> 34:55.792
Annie, I'd like to introduce
you to Willy Taylor.

34:55.793 --> 34:57.894
Willy, this is Annie
Hayes, my dating coach.

34:57.895 --> 34:58.962
Hi.

34:58.963 --> 35:00.163
Nice to meet you.

35:00.164 --> 35:01.724
I got to say, you're
doing a bang-up job

35:01.748 --> 35:02.632
with my friend here.

35:02.633 --> 35:04.601
Ah, he's doing a great
job all on his own.

35:04.602 --> 35:07.571
I'm just here for moral support.

35:07.572 --> 35:10.975
So when do we expect
our target to show up?

35:19.217 --> 35:22.352
- Is that her?
- Right on time.

35:22.353 --> 35:26.089
I can do this, I can do this.

35:26.090 --> 35:28.758
- I can do this, right?
- Of course you can.

35:28.759 --> 35:31.461
Just remember what
we worked on, okay?

35:31.462 --> 35:32.822
You know what you're
going to say,

35:32.846 --> 35:37.200
so just relax.

35:37.201 --> 35:38.902
Now make your move.

35:38.903 --> 35:40.370
It's time to shine.

35:40.371 --> 35:41.605
All right.

35:41.606 --> 35:47.544
All right, here I go.

35:52.817 --> 35:54.417
Hi.

35:54.418 --> 35:57.521
Hi.

35:57.522 --> 35:58.622
Are you okay?

35:58.623 --> 36:00.390
I just wanted to
introduce myself.

36:00.391 --> 36:02.425
I'm Harold. Harold White.

36:02.426 --> 36:04.895
Julie. Julie Owens.

36:04.896 --> 36:07.564
Nice to meet you.

36:07.565 --> 36:09.799
I've seen you here before.

36:09.800 --> 36:12.736
I've seen you too. I
love the new haircut.

36:12.737 --> 36:15.939
And that color... It
looks great on you.

36:15.940 --> 36:17.541
Oh, thanks.

36:17.542 --> 36:20.810
Yeah, you always look
so, um, stylish.

36:20.811 --> 36:25.115
Thank you.

36:25.116 --> 36:28.218
So, um, what did you order?

36:28.219 --> 36:32.622
I usually kind of play it safe and...
plain old coffee.

36:32.623 --> 36:35.225
I've tried almost everything.

36:35.226 --> 36:36.560
I like to switch it up.

36:36.561 --> 36:38.728
Keeps things interesting.

36:38.729 --> 36:40.230
Well, I like that.

36:40.231 --> 36:44.968
Sounds, um, adventurous.

36:44.969 --> 36:46.603
Listen.

36:46.604 --> 36:47.804
Hmm?

36:47.805 --> 36:49.306
Do you want to get
together sometime?

36:49.307 --> 36:52.409
Yeah. I'd love that.

36:52.410 --> 36:54.477
My number's on the back.
Call me.

36:54.478 --> 36:57.948
Nice meeting you, Harold.

36:57.949 --> 37:00.183
Yeah, it's nice meeting you...

37:00.184 --> 37:02.553
Julie.

37:07.491 --> 37:09.459
That looked promising.

37:09.460 --> 37:12.696
So what happened?

37:12.697 --> 37:14.664
Oh, nice!

37:14.665 --> 37:15.932
Whoo!

37:15.933 --> 37:18.168
You scored. I knew
you could do it.

37:18.169 --> 37:21.638
I got to call Denise.
She's going to go crazy.

37:21.639 --> 37:24.474
You just went from
being on the bench

37:24.475 --> 37:26.576
to being the star quarterback.

37:26.577 --> 37:27.844
Never thought I'd see the day.

37:27.845 --> 37:29.947
Yeah. You and me both.

37:41.792 --> 37:45.695
My advice is to make plans
to meet Julie for drinks.

37:45.696 --> 37:47.731
It's great because
it's a public place,

37:47.732 --> 37:49.366
and she'll feel more comfortable

37:49.367 --> 37:50.734
since she doesn't
really know you.

37:50.735 --> 37:53.236
Also, it's a short
time commitment,

37:53.237 --> 37:56.406
so if things go south, you
don't have to stay long.

37:56.407 --> 37:58.308
That's a good idea.

37:58.309 --> 37:59.676
This also means

37:59.677 --> 38:04.247
you get to advance
to the next level.

38:04.248 --> 38:07.484
Time to tackle the
art of conversation.

38:07.485 --> 38:10.754
Another one of my weak points.

38:10.755 --> 38:12.489
Okay, let's start
with the basics.

38:12.490 --> 38:14.457
Listening and asking questions.

38:14.458 --> 38:15.892
They go hand in hand.

38:15.893 --> 38:17.394
When you ask a question,

38:17.395 --> 38:19.829
it automatically gives
you more to talk about.

38:19.830 --> 38:22.198
And when a man
listens to a woman

38:22.199 --> 38:25.201
and remembers what she says,

38:25.202 --> 38:29.639
in the world of
relationships, it's golden.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.574
Trust me on this.

38:31.575 --> 38:33.543
Got it.

38:33.544 --> 38:35.478
Okay, so Kim here is
going to play your date.

38:35.479 --> 38:37.280
Oh. I'm good at dating.

38:37.281 --> 38:38.348
Good.

38:38.349 --> 38:40.450
Now, let's say you
guys just met,

38:40.451 --> 38:42.085
- you sat down at the bar.
- Okay.

38:42.086 --> 38:44.287
You got your drinks,

38:44.288 --> 38:46.423
and now it's time
to start talking.

38:46.424 --> 38:47.524
Okay.

38:47.525 --> 38:49.392
So Harold, you start things off.

38:49.393 --> 38:53.763
Um...

38:53.764 --> 38:56.166
Hi. Uh...

38:56.167 --> 38:59.569
What are your... What
are your career goals?

38:59.570 --> 39:01.037
Career goals?

39:01.038 --> 39:03.139
Suddenly, I'm, like,
at a job interview

39:03.140 --> 39:04.700
with the inquisition.
I don't want to...

39:04.724 --> 39:05.909
Yeah, I'm sorry.

39:05.910 --> 39:07.711
Harold, not so
formal, all right?

39:07.712 --> 39:10.246
Try for something a
little more relaxed.

39:10.247 --> 39:12.248
Okay. Right, right. Um...

39:12.249 --> 39:14.918
Right.

39:14.919 --> 39:19.689
You, um, you look nice tonight.

39:19.690 --> 39:22.225
Oh, thank you, Harold.

39:22.226 --> 39:24.394
I don't even have any makeup on.
Just the lip gloss.

39:24.395 --> 39:27.130
I just came from the gym.
Thank you.

39:27.131 --> 39:29.032
Uh, what do you do for a living?

39:29.033 --> 39:30.567
Oh, I am an actress. Yeah.

39:30.568 --> 39:34.904
Well, um, I'm a waitress by
day and actress by night.

39:34.905 --> 39:38.007
All right, well, right now, I'm
a waitress by day and night,

39:38.008 --> 39:40.276
but I'm auditioning and
getting lots of call-backs,

39:40.277 --> 39:42.946
thank you for asking.

39:42.947 --> 39:45.115
Uh, what do you
like to do for fun?

39:45.116 --> 39:48.151
Oh, for fun? Good question.

39:48.152 --> 39:50.720
I, um, I collect teeth.
Different animals' teeth.

39:50.721 --> 39:53.022
You know, they've already
passed on, and I love teeth.

39:53.023 --> 39:56.259
And I raise iguanas,
which I love.

39:56.260 --> 39:57.360
Mm-hmm.

39:57.361 --> 39:59.395
I make, uh, art out
of pie filling,

39:59.396 --> 40:00.797
which is fun.

40:00.798 --> 40:03.433
And um, I'm a wench.
I love jousting.

40:03.434 --> 40:08.371
I have... I'm the champion
jouster at the medieval fair.

40:08.372 --> 40:10.140
No judgment.

40:10.141 --> 40:12.909
Um, it's not going to be
this hard with Julie.

40:12.910 --> 40:13.910
Cheers.

40:13.911 --> 40:16.747
Oh, cheers.

40:18.783 --> 40:20.884
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

40:20.885 --> 40:24.087
So, um, what do you
do for a living?

40:24.088 --> 40:26.022
I'm a sales rep in real estate.

40:26.023 --> 40:27.624
I've been doing it
almost ten years now,

40:27.625 --> 40:28.658
and I love it.

40:28.659 --> 40:30.560
That's interesting.

40:30.561 --> 40:33.196
And how did you get
into that line of work?

40:33.197 --> 40:34.964
A friend of my dad's
is in the business.

40:34.965 --> 40:36.800
It's what I always
wanted to get into,

40:36.801 --> 40:39.102
so after college, I went
and worked with him.

40:39.103 --> 40:40.770
That's great.

40:40.771 --> 40:44.207
And, um, what do you
like to do for fun?

40:44.208 --> 40:46.109
Oh, where to start?

40:46.110 --> 40:48.077
I love traveling,
which I do a lot of.

40:48.078 --> 40:50.680
I just got back from
Brazil, which was amazing.

40:50.681 --> 40:54.918
Love fashion, love movies.
Do you like movies?

40:54.919 --> 40:56.519
Yeah, sure.

40:56.520 --> 40:59.589
What about horror flicks?
I love monster movies.

40:59.590 --> 41:02.525
Yeah, I don't get to
see too many of them,

41:02.526 --> 41:03.593
but you know.

41:03.594 --> 41:04.727
Well, hey, you know.

41:04.728 --> 41:06.796
Something just opened
downtown at that theater.

41:06.797 --> 41:09.532
It looks really scary.
We should go see it.

41:09.533 --> 41:12.035
Ooh, doesn't look
too scary, does it?

41:12.036 --> 41:13.570
Well, I hope it's scary.

41:13.571 --> 41:14.704
Rah!

41:26.183 --> 41:28.151
So we're going to a
movie Friday night.

41:28.152 --> 41:31.254
Hey. Good stuff.

41:31.255 --> 41:33.590
Look at you, racking
up those dates.

41:33.591 --> 41:35.091
How did the conversation go?

41:35.092 --> 41:36.359
Pretty good, I think.

41:36.360 --> 41:38.695
It doesn't take much
to get her talking.

41:38.696 --> 41:43.566
She's really, uh, open about
the things she likes to do.

41:43.567 --> 41:44.901
Good.

41:44.902 --> 41:48.438
Okay, so now it's time
for you to do the same.

41:48.439 --> 41:51.174
Which brings us to our
next order of business.

41:51.175 --> 41:53.509
If you really want to
get close to somebody,

41:53.510 --> 41:55.245
you need to start sharing.

41:55.246 --> 41:57.113
You mean, like, talking
about my background,

41:57.114 --> 41:58.948
that kind of thing?

41:58.949 --> 42:01.317
Well, yeah, but more than that.

42:01.318 --> 42:02.986
You know, getting
close to somebody

42:02.987 --> 42:06.823
means talking about the
things that matter to you.

42:06.824 --> 42:08.858
Like, what are you
passionate about?

42:08.859 --> 42:11.628
What do you love?
What moves you?

42:11.629 --> 42:14.330
Those are the things you
want to share with her.

42:14.331 --> 42:16.900
Okay, but, uh...

42:16.901 --> 42:18.268
Yeah? But what?

42:18.269 --> 42:20.937
No, I'm just...

42:20.938 --> 42:23.773
I'm afraid I might
disappoint, you know?

42:23.774 --> 42:27.277
I think I might be
kind of boring.

42:27.278 --> 42:31.614
Harold, that is so not true.

42:31.615 --> 42:35.051
The right person is going to
love you for who you are.

42:35.052 --> 42:36.152
Trust me.

42:37.288 --> 42:39.088
There's just one problem though.

42:39.089 --> 42:40.057
What?

42:40.058 --> 42:42.058
Who are you?

42:42.059 --> 42:44.827
I mean, I know you have
great taste in music,

42:44.828 --> 42:49.233
but what are you
passionate about?

42:51.135 --> 42:52.902
You took all these photographs?

42:52.903 --> 42:54.437
Yup.

42:54.438 --> 42:56.806
Printed them, too.

42:56.807 --> 42:59.575
I had no idea.

42:59.576 --> 43:01.010
There's something so exciting

43:01.011 --> 43:04.614
to me about preserving
a perfect moment,

43:04.615 --> 43:06.849
you know, to hang onto
something beautiful

43:06.850 --> 43:12.221
that never fades nor goes away.

43:12.222 --> 43:13.723
Does that sound corny?

43:13.724 --> 43:16.159
No. Not at all.

43:16.160 --> 43:17.560
I just...

43:17.561 --> 43:20.830
I wouldn't have guessed you
for the creative type.

43:23.133 --> 43:26.503
You just keep on getting
more and more interesting.

43:28.872 --> 43:32.208
Mmm. It's delicious.

43:32.209 --> 43:33.177
Really?

43:33.178 --> 43:34.498
Well, I tried to
make it healthy.

43:34.499 --> 43:35.467
You sure it's good?

43:35.468 --> 43:36.713
It's incredible.

43:36.714 --> 43:40.683
Harold, I had no idea you
were such a good cook.

43:40.684 --> 43:42.185
- Well.
- Okay.

43:42.186 --> 43:45.221
All of this plays
into your favor.

43:45.222 --> 43:47.824
Let's recap, shall we?

43:47.825 --> 43:50.426
All right, you like
candlelit dinners.

43:50.427 --> 43:51.527
Uh-huh.

43:51.528 --> 43:53.262
- Gorgeous photographs.
- Yeah.

43:53.263 --> 43:55.031
Your favorite movie
is Casablanca,

43:55.032 --> 43:56.872
and we're not even counting
the love songs yet.

43:56.896 --> 43:57.800
Need I go on?

43:57.801 --> 44:02.605
Oh, um, does that
seem a little bland?

44:02.606 --> 44:05.041
No way.

44:05.042 --> 44:09.145
Harold, you're like this
old-fashioned romantic.

44:09.146 --> 44:12.482
Most women think guys
like you are extinct.

44:12.483 --> 44:13.883
Or never existed.

44:13.884 --> 44:16.319
You know, at least
outside a romance novel.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.287
You think so?

44:17.288 --> 44:19.522
Oh, I know so.

44:19.523 --> 44:22.125
Harold, for your next date,

44:22.126 --> 44:25.194
I want you to share
this side of yourself.

44:25.195 --> 44:28.131
Tell her about something
you love doing,

44:28.132 --> 44:30.800
and do something with
her that's romantic.

44:30.801 --> 44:33.803
I promise you, you're
not going to regret it.

44:33.804 --> 44:34.837
All right.

44:34.838 --> 44:37.507
- Okay?
- Okay.

44:37.508 --> 44:39.242
- Plenty more of that.
- Mmm.

44:39.243 --> 44:40.543
Good.

44:40.544 --> 44:44.614
I loved that part when
he popped up behind her

44:44.615 --> 44:46.282
with that big knife.

44:46.283 --> 44:47.917
How freaky was that?

44:47.918 --> 44:50.453
I, um, closed my eyes
through that part.

44:50.454 --> 44:52.214
And then the chase scene
through the woods...

44:52.238 --> 44:53.356
Wasn't that scary?

44:53.357 --> 44:56.159
Actually, I closed my eyes
through that part too.

44:56.160 --> 44:58.528
I think I'm going to have
nightmares all week.

44:58.529 --> 44:59.829
Yeah, me too.

44:59.830 --> 45:01.564
It was great, wasn't it?

45:01.565 --> 45:02.832
Yeah.

45:02.833 --> 45:04.753
They have really good
double chocolate cake here.

45:04.777 --> 45:05.902
Do you like chocolate?

45:05.903 --> 45:07.537
Love it, I'm addicted.

45:07.538 --> 45:11.407
Well, we could share
a piece if you want.

45:11.408 --> 45:14.344
How could I refuse?

45:17.748 --> 45:19.582
Thanks for the movie.

45:19.583 --> 45:22.085
Thank you for dessert.

45:22.086 --> 45:24.954
Look, I really had fun tonight.

45:24.955 --> 45:26.989
Me too.

45:26.990 --> 45:29.560
You're a great guy, Harold.

45:35.132 --> 45:36.632
Good night.

45:36.633 --> 45:38.969
Good night.

45:47.411 --> 45:50.947
Okay, so two fries, two burgers.

45:50.948 --> 45:53.483
Cheese on yours, no cheese.

45:53.484 --> 45:55.124
You want fries, you
want mashed potatoes.

45:55.148 --> 45:56.586
Do you want coleslaw too or...

45:56.587 --> 45:58.588
- Yeah, we'll do some coleslaw.
- Great, you're here.

45:58.589 --> 45:59.856
I need to talk to
you for a second.

45:59.857 --> 46:01.190
I... uh, Harold, what
are you doing here?

46:01.191 --> 46:02.751
- I thought you had a date.
- No, I did.

46:02.775 --> 46:04.260
- Can I just see you?
- Sure.

46:04.261 --> 46:06.195
Sorry, excuse us.

46:06.196 --> 46:07.830
- Is everything okay?
- Better than okay.

46:07.831 --> 46:09.231
I had to come by
and say thank you.

46:09.255 --> 46:11.467
You were so right about
everything you taught me.

46:11.468 --> 46:13.136
Being myself and
asking questions

46:13.137 --> 46:14.704
and just sharing who I am.

46:14.705 --> 46:16.545
I did exactly what you
told me, and it was like

46:16.569 --> 46:17.707
we were really connecting.

46:17.708 --> 46:20.576
Do you know she even
kissed me good night?

46:20.577 --> 46:21.777
- That's so great.
- I know.

46:21.778 --> 46:22.979
I just... I feel different.

46:22.980 --> 46:25.281
Everything is gonna be
different from now on

46:25.282 --> 46:27.016
all because of you.

46:27.017 --> 46:29.285
Ah, thank you.

46:29.286 --> 46:30.553
Yeah.

46:30.554 --> 46:31.721
So we're still on for
Wednesday, right?

46:31.722 --> 46:33.055
- Yeah, for sure.
- Okay.

46:33.056 --> 46:34.957
Good, so... I'll see you then.

46:34.958 --> 46:36.192
- Okay, I'll see you.
- Bye.

46:36.193 --> 46:37.894
And... and great work.

46:37.895 --> 46:40.796
Really great.

46:40.797 --> 46:44.333
Wow.

46:44.334 --> 46:45.969
Wow.

46:48.972 --> 46:51.307
Denise, if you don't
hear from me by noon,

46:51.308 --> 46:53.109
I want you to call a paramedic.

46:53.110 --> 46:54.510
Bye, sweetheart.

46:54.511 --> 46:55.912
This is all your
fault, you know?

46:55.913 --> 46:57.613
- What is?
- This.

46:57.614 --> 46:59.081
Making me do all this.

46:59.082 --> 47:00.883
Ever since you
started working out,

47:00.884 --> 47:02.351
all I've been
hearing at home is,

47:02.352 --> 47:04.787
"why don't you get in
shape like Harold is?"

47:04.788 --> 47:06.155
And "why don't you ask Harold
to bring you with him"

47:06.156 --> 47:07.423
the next time he works out?"

47:07.424 --> 47:08.904
Yeah, but it feels
great, doesn't it?

47:08.928 --> 47:11.627
Great? This isn't great.

47:11.628 --> 47:13.896
Great is sitting at
home on my couch,

47:13.897 --> 47:15.364
watching the game,
drinking beers,

47:15.365 --> 47:16.566
and eating chips.

47:16.567 --> 47:18.007
Come on, we got to
keep up the pace,

47:18.008 --> 47:19.341
we only got another mile to go.

47:19.342 --> 47:22.004
What? Shoot me now.

47:22.005 --> 47:23.973
You know, I was
thinking about maybe

47:23.974 --> 47:26.042
trying to cook for Julie.

47:26.043 --> 47:28.277
Maybe a candlelight
dinner or something.

47:28.278 --> 47:29.779
Who are you?

47:29.780 --> 47:32.315
Preparing candlelight dinners?

47:32.316 --> 47:34.450
I definitely don't
recognize you anymore.

47:34.451 --> 47:35.751
I don't recognize me either.

47:35.752 --> 47:39.522
I got to tell you, feels great.

47:39.523 --> 47:41.390
This isn't great.

47:41.391 --> 47:44.060
I've never seen Harold
like that before.

47:44.061 --> 47:46.429
He's, like, this whole new man.

47:46.430 --> 47:48.030
I almost didn't
recognize the guy.

47:48.031 --> 47:49.699
I know, from what
I've seen, like,

47:49.700 --> 47:51.100
you've done a great
transformation.

47:51.124 --> 47:53.102
It's like you have a
gift for this, really.

47:53.103 --> 47:54.570
I mean, if word gets out, like,

47:54.571 --> 47:56.472
you could be famous,
really, you really could.

47:56.473 --> 47:58.153
You could have, like,
your face on the side

47:58.177 --> 48:01.944
of, like, bus benches
or a reality show...

48:01.945 --> 48:05.014
If they offer you a series, can
I please, please play you?

48:05.015 --> 48:07.116
It almost sounded like

48:07.117 --> 48:09.585
he didn't need me
anymore though.

48:09.586 --> 48:11.220
But that... That can't be right.

48:11.221 --> 48:12.321
Right?

48:12.322 --> 48:14.390
He needs me, he needs me.

48:14.391 --> 48:16.826
For sure.

48:16.827 --> 48:19.462
Are you more worried about
losing your dating coach gig

48:19.463 --> 48:22.398
or the fact that this guy
is now off the market?

48:22.399 --> 48:24.800
What do you mean?

48:24.801 --> 48:26.769
You like him, don't you?

48:26.770 --> 48:28.371
- I... of course not.
- Yes.

48:28.372 --> 48:30.439
That is crazy, no.

48:30.440 --> 48:31.774
- You do.
- I do not.

48:31.775 --> 48:33.215
Your mouth just had
a little quiver.

48:33.239 --> 48:34.877
It never... Has never done that.

48:34.878 --> 48:38.114
No, it's professional, we're
working together, that's it.

48:38.115 --> 48:39.315
- Really?
- Really.

48:39.316 --> 48:40.416
- Really?
- Yes.

48:40.417 --> 48:43.620
All right, just checking.

48:45.222 --> 48:47.523
Although I have to say,
since you've worked on him,

48:47.524 --> 48:50.092
he has gotten kind of hot.

48:50.093 --> 48:52.261
I'm just saying.

48:52.262 --> 48:55.698
♪ Annie and Harold,
sitting in a tree ♪

48:55.699 --> 48:58.568
♪ K-I-S-S-I-N-G ♪

49:07.110 --> 49:08.344
Try this.

49:08.345 --> 49:11.148
What is it?

49:15.585 --> 49:18.187
It's delicious.

49:18.188 --> 49:20.323
- Pineapple.
- Pomegranate.

49:20.324 --> 49:23.326
- And raspberry.
- And coconut.

49:24.728 --> 49:27.496
So tell me, what am
I learning today?

49:27.497 --> 49:31.334
Well, I was thinking,
you're at that stage

49:31.335 --> 49:33.736
where it's not super serious,

49:33.737 --> 49:35.738
but you want it to go that way.

49:35.739 --> 49:38.207
So now might be a
good time for you

49:38.208 --> 49:40.710
to do something nice for her

49:40.711 --> 49:43.012
or make her feel special.

49:43.013 --> 49:45.581
I love that. What do
you have in mind?

49:45.582 --> 49:48.351
All right, well, forget
expensive, all right?

49:48.352 --> 49:50.186
It shouldn't be
anything too big.

49:50.187 --> 49:52.188
You don't want to scare her off.

49:52.189 --> 49:54.357
So I don't know,
just something small

49:54.358 --> 49:57.059
to show her you really care.

49:57.060 --> 49:59.829
Oh, you know what?
I have an idea.

49:59.830 --> 50:01.430
- You do?
- Yeah.

50:01.431 --> 50:03.031
See, Julie's always
talking about wanting

50:03.055 --> 50:04.200
to spend time in the city.

50:04.201 --> 50:06.235
I could take her somewhere
nice for dinner.

50:06.236 --> 50:07.837
Unless you think
that's too much.

50:07.838 --> 50:10.272
No, no, that could work.

50:10.273 --> 50:12.108
Gotta think about where
I could take her.

50:12.109 --> 50:15.411
It's gotta be really romantic.

50:15.412 --> 50:17.847
I could... I could probably
recommend a place.

50:17.848 --> 50:19.348
Oh, great, let me
know what it is.

50:19.349 --> 50:21.417
I'll make reservations.

50:21.418 --> 50:24.053
You know, I actually...

50:24.054 --> 50:26.856
I haven't been there in so long.

50:26.857 --> 50:29.992
I'm thinking, maybe we should
go there first and check it out

50:29.993 --> 50:32.862
just to make sure
it's the right spot.

50:32.863 --> 50:35.732
Yeah, that sounds great.

50:41.805 --> 50:44.640
♪ ♪

50:44.641 --> 50:46.409
I'm thinking, before dinner,

50:46.410 --> 50:48.577
you guys could go for
a nice, long walk,

50:48.578 --> 50:51.046
watch the sun set.

50:51.047 --> 50:53.983
I like that idea, it's,
um, it's romantic.

50:53.984 --> 50:55.985
And good for the appetite.

50:55.986 --> 50:57.453
You know, this place is perfect.

50:57.454 --> 50:59.288
Julie's gonna love it.

50:59.289 --> 51:00.689
I'm suddenly wondering
why I don't

51:00.690 --> 51:02.291
come into the city more often.

51:02.292 --> 51:04.026
Harold... I can't believe

51:04.027 --> 51:06.195
I just heard you say that.

51:06.196 --> 51:08.197
That doesn't sound like
the Harold I know.

51:08.198 --> 51:11.100
Well, that's thanks to you.

51:11.101 --> 51:13.102
- Oh, before I forget.
- Yeah.

51:13.103 --> 51:16.006
Here is your last payment.

51:22.212 --> 51:27.183
So... that homecoming
dance we went to...

51:27.184 --> 51:28.684
Yeah.

51:28.685 --> 51:32.254
We danced together.

51:32.255 --> 51:33.289
No.

51:33.290 --> 51:35.658
No?

51:35.659 --> 51:38.228
Are you sure?

51:41.898 --> 51:44.266
You invited a bunch
of your friends

51:44.267 --> 51:45.668
to meet us at the dance.

51:45.669 --> 51:50.339
I didn't really fit
in with that group.

51:50.340 --> 51:51.941
When I finally got the nerve up

51:51.942 --> 51:56.111
to ask you to dance,
I was too late.

51:56.112 --> 51:58.714
Matt Schneider had
gotten to you first.

52:07.157 --> 52:10.059
Couldn't get up the
courage to ask you again.

52:10.060 --> 52:12.127
Matt Schneider?

52:12.128 --> 52:14.631
You remember that?

52:17.567 --> 52:20.770
Kind of thing tends
to stay with you.

52:24.541 --> 52:27.610
Sometimes longer than
people think it should.

52:27.611 --> 52:31.113
That's not why you
remember the dance, is it?

52:31.114 --> 52:33.283
I didn't make you
feel that way, did I?

52:39.089 --> 52:42.091
I'm really sorry, I...

52:42.092 --> 52:46.028
I promise you, I... I
never meant to do that.

52:46.029 --> 52:50.766
I was 15, it was just me
trying to have a good time.

52:50.767 --> 52:52.701
Yeah.

52:52.702 --> 52:55.872
It wasn't supposed to
make you feel bad.

52:58.041 --> 53:00.910
Well, hey, if it makes
you feel any better,

53:00.911 --> 53:05.147
you're doing a lot better
in life than I am.

53:05.148 --> 53:10.619
I have no career and
no relationship.

53:10.620 --> 53:12.988
Come on, Annie.

53:12.989 --> 53:15.149
I mean, you're the prettiest
girl from our high school.

53:15.173 --> 53:19.528
I know you're gonna
meet somebody.

53:19.529 --> 53:21.196
I've seen your work.

53:21.197 --> 53:25.134
It's only a matter of time
before somebody hires you.

53:25.135 --> 53:28.637
You just have to
believe in yourself.

53:28.638 --> 53:31.707
I know I do.

53:31.708 --> 53:34.176
Wait a second.

53:34.177 --> 53:37.780
Did you just give
me my own advice?

53:37.781 --> 53:38.781
I think you did.

53:40.317 --> 53:41.717
Yeah.

53:41.718 --> 53:43.987
Very good.

53:45.956 --> 53:48.557
What about Billie Holiday?

53:48.558 --> 53:49.758
Oh, I love it.

53:49.759 --> 53:51.427
Have you heard her
version of Misty?

53:51.428 --> 53:52.595
Amazing.

53:52.596 --> 53:53.956
Although first place
for that song

53:53.980 --> 53:55.264
still belongs to Johnny Mathis.

53:55.265 --> 53:57.399
What about Tony Bennett?

53:57.400 --> 54:00.169
Classic. Definitely
in my top ten.

54:00.170 --> 54:01.570
Uh-huh.

54:01.571 --> 54:03.706
Do you like Dean Martin?

54:03.707 --> 54:05.774
You're Nobody Till
Somebody Loves You.

54:05.775 --> 54:07.910
Mm, it's one of my favorites.

54:07.911 --> 54:10.913
You know, some people
would say we're sappy

54:10.914 --> 54:13.949
or born in the wrong era for
listening to that kind of music.

54:13.950 --> 54:15.751
Who cares?

54:15.752 --> 54:17.019
It's the best stuff on earth.

54:17.020 --> 54:19.288
I know.

54:19.289 --> 54:21.557
This... This could very well be

54:21.558 --> 54:23.525
my first choice for the song.

54:23.526 --> 54:25.260
The song?

54:25.261 --> 54:28.430
Yeah, you know, the one
that becomes our song

54:28.431 --> 54:31.434
when you find the
right somebody.

54:34.604 --> 54:36.171
When you share a
song with somebody.

54:36.172 --> 54:37.640
Mm-hmm.

54:37.641 --> 54:41.244
Oh, I've always liked
that idea too.

54:56.126 --> 54:58.594
Did you just get in?

54:58.595 --> 54:59.728
Yeah.

54:59.729 --> 55:02.297
Just a little while ago.

55:02.298 --> 55:05.634
Been putting in some
late nights, you...

55:05.635 --> 55:08.905
You look tired.

55:10.106 --> 55:11.607
Annie?

55:11.608 --> 55:12.975
Hmm?

55:12.976 --> 55:14.410
Are you okay?

55:14.411 --> 55:16.211
Yeah.

55:16.212 --> 55:18.281
Okay, don't stay up too late.

55:20.650 --> 55:23.953
Listen, I wanted to tell you...

55:29.759 --> 55:33.262
I know I haven't been the
best sister in the world.

55:33.263 --> 55:38.667
Moving in here and not
really pulling my weight.

55:38.668 --> 55:41.270
I just... Things haven't really

55:41.271 --> 55:45.507
worked out the way that I
wanted them to, you know?

55:45.508 --> 55:49.511
I never thought life
would be this hard.

55:49.512 --> 55:53.382
Anyway, I'm sorry.

55:53.383 --> 55:56.618
I just wanted you to know that.

55:56.619 --> 55:58.887
Thanks.

55:58.888 --> 56:01.824
And I also wanted to tell you

56:01.825 --> 56:04.860
what a great job I
think you're doing,

56:04.861 --> 56:09.498
being a great mom and
having a great family.

56:09.499 --> 56:14.470
You've got a lot to be proud of.

56:14.471 --> 56:17.407
I appreciate that.

56:20.176 --> 56:22.411
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

56:22.412 --> 56:24.113
Good night.

56:24.114 --> 56:27.183
Good night.

56:49.873 --> 56:52.175
Annie, yeah, it's open, come in.

56:55.512 --> 56:59.148
- Hi.
- Hey.

56:59.149 --> 57:01.517
Oh, wow.

57:01.518 --> 57:02.785
These are new, aren't they?

57:02.786 --> 57:05.788
Yeah. What do you think?

57:05.789 --> 57:07.856
I think they're amazing.

57:07.857 --> 57:09.458
They belong in a museum.

57:09.459 --> 57:10.592
Really?

57:10.593 --> 57:14.196
Oh, yeah.

57:14.197 --> 57:17.199
Wow.

57:17.200 --> 57:19.201
Man, this is beautiful.

57:19.202 --> 57:21.471
Thanks.

57:25.008 --> 57:28.043
Uh, are you ready
to get started?

57:28.044 --> 57:30.580
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

57:33.249 --> 57:35.250
So today we're gonna work on

57:35.251 --> 57:37.886
one of the most important
parts of dating.

57:37.887 --> 57:41.156
Getting close,
becoming intimate,

57:41.157 --> 57:43.625
you know, getting to first base.

57:43.626 --> 57:45.127
Yeah.

57:45.128 --> 57:49.398
This could be the most important
lesson in dating ever.

57:49.399 --> 57:51.767
Agreed.

57:51.768 --> 57:55.804
So how do you recommend
I make a move?

57:55.805 --> 57:57.940
Well, first of all,

57:57.941 --> 58:00.576
wait until you guys
are close together.

58:00.577 --> 58:01.777
Uh-huh.

58:01.778 --> 58:03.078
After you've been talking awhile

58:03.079 --> 58:08.050
or when you're saying good
night at the end of the date.

58:08.051 --> 58:12.654
So, um, like this?

58:12.655 --> 58:15.390
Yeah, good.

58:15.391 --> 58:19.428
Now, the most important thing
is to be natural about it.

58:19.429 --> 58:22.097
You know, don't do the old "guy
gotta stretch my arm" routine.

58:22.098 --> 58:23.899
Stay away from tacky.

58:23.900 --> 58:25.434
Yep.

58:25.435 --> 58:28.837
And...

58:28.838 --> 58:31.373
And use your eyes.

58:31.374 --> 58:33.442
- My eyes.
- Mm-hmm.

58:33.443 --> 58:37.079
Look at a girl when
she's talking to you.

58:37.080 --> 58:40.315
And if she's looking
at you the same way,

58:40.316 --> 58:43.253
she's giving you
the green light.

58:46.456 --> 58:48.423
Like this?

58:48.424 --> 58:50.793
Mm-hmm.

58:52.896 --> 58:54.963
Then what?

58:54.964 --> 58:59.135
And then you just
lean in slowly.

59:02.772 --> 59:04.640
Yeah.

59:04.641 --> 59:07.977
And then you just...

59:25.028 --> 59:26.194
How was that?

59:26.195 --> 59:28.830
It was great.

59:28.831 --> 59:33.435
I mean, I mean, you
did all right.

59:33.436 --> 59:36.204
How do... How do
you feel about it?

59:36.205 --> 59:37.372
Okay.

59:37.373 --> 59:38.674
Just okay?

59:38.675 --> 59:40.375
Well, shouldn't I feel okay?

59:40.376 --> 59:42.778
No, no, you should be okay.

59:42.779 --> 59:44.446
Definitely be okay.

59:44.447 --> 59:46.748
Um, I'm just thinking
though that we should

59:46.749 --> 59:49.217
probably run through
this a few more times.

59:49.218 --> 59:52.054
Just to make sure you're
comfortable with everything.

59:52.055 --> 59:54.556
Yeah, I mean,
that's a good idea.

59:54.557 --> 59:57.192
- Sure.
- Good.

59:57.193 --> 01:00:00.429
So...

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:03.366
I'm ready whenever you are.

01:00:05.301 --> 01:00:09.571
Um, so you were
pretty quiet tonight.

01:00:09.572 --> 01:00:11.974
What do you think
of the restaurant?

01:00:11.975 --> 01:00:14.042
It's nice.

01:00:14.043 --> 01:00:17.713
I just wish we could have
done more, you know?

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:22.384
Seen a show or maybe
check out some clubs.

01:00:22.385 --> 01:00:26.588
There's just so much
to do in the city.

01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:30.226
Well, um, maybe next time.

01:00:33.162 --> 01:00:35.998
Can I get your chair?

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:38.500
It was nice though.
Thanks, Harold.

01:00:38.501 --> 01:00:39.768
Sure.

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:43.372
You know, um...

01:00:43.373 --> 01:00:45.173
People say I'm not
such a bad cook.

01:00:45.174 --> 01:00:49.478
Maybe next time we can
have dinner at my house.

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:51.814
That sounds good.

01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:03.125
Whoo, closing time.

01:01:03.126 --> 01:01:05.594
Here we go.

01:01:05.595 --> 01:01:06.762
Hello?

01:01:06.763 --> 01:01:08.397
- Hmm?
- Anybody there?

01:01:08.398 --> 01:01:10.832
You've been in a daze all night

01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:13.435
with that, like, gooey
look on your face.

01:01:13.436 --> 01:01:15.871
You okay?

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:20.175
Who is he, and does
he have a friend

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:21.977
that looks like Ben Affleck?

01:01:23.546 --> 01:01:27.949
No, I'm just thinking
about Harold.

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:31.653
You know, he's just not who
I thought he was at all.

01:01:31.654 --> 01:01:34.322
I mean, he's this
amazing photographer.

01:01:34.323 --> 01:01:39.594
And he's smart and
romantic and...

01:01:39.595 --> 01:01:41.463
And it's funny, like,
all this time,

01:01:41.464 --> 01:01:43.765
I just thought he was a nobody.

01:01:43.766 --> 01:01:47.035
That makes me a horrible
person, doesn't it?

01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:49.371
Nope, Annie, it
makes you someone

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:52.474
who obviously has the
hots for this guy.

01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:55.744
Kim, he's dating someone.

01:01:55.745 --> 01:02:00.916
And she's beautiful and
successful, and I'm...

01:02:00.917 --> 01:02:04.286
You're beautiful,
and you love him.

01:02:04.287 --> 01:02:05.554
Just admit it.

01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:08.156
I cannot like him. He's taken.

01:02:08.157 --> 01:02:09.925
And that was not my point.

01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:11.259
What was your point?

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.762
I don't know, I just...

01:02:13.763 --> 01:02:16.565
I didn't realize what
a great guy he is.

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:21.636
All right, whatever you say.

01:02:21.637 --> 01:02:23.472
I'm out of here.

01:02:29.645 --> 01:02:31.880
Whatever you're cooking
smells incredible.

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:34.149
We're gonna be ready to
eat in about ten minutes.

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:37.152
My special Risotto.

01:02:37.153 --> 01:02:38.487
Harold, you don't happen to know

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:39.855
any event planners, do you?

01:02:39.856 --> 01:02:41.496
A good friend of mine
is putting together

01:02:41.497 --> 01:02:42.657
a big fundraiser in the city.

01:02:42.681 --> 01:02:43.792
Are you serious?

01:02:43.793 --> 01:02:46.394
- She said they're desperate.
- I know someone great.

01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:48.163
She and I went to
high school together.

01:02:48.164 --> 01:02:49.364
Can you get me her number?

01:02:49.365 --> 01:02:51.633
Yeah, of course, no problem.

01:02:51.634 --> 01:02:52.801
Thank you.

01:02:52.802 --> 01:02:54.903
So where are we going tonight?

01:02:54.904 --> 01:02:57.305
Uh, what do you mean?

01:02:57.306 --> 01:03:00.308
You mentioned dancing.

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:02.029
Oh, right, yeah, no, I
thought we'd pick out

01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:04.031
some records from my
collection and dance here.

01:03:04.032 --> 01:03:05.180
I got lots of Sinatra.

01:03:05.181 --> 01:03:07.282
You like Sinatra?

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:09.050
I guess I misunderstood.

01:03:09.051 --> 01:03:11.486
I thought you meant we'd be
going out for the dancing part.

01:03:11.487 --> 01:03:14.756
No, I just kind of planned
a quiet evening in.

01:03:14.757 --> 01:03:17.760
What do you think?

01:03:19.128 --> 01:03:21.263
Anything I can do to
change your mind?

01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:24.199
I'm not really into
the old stuff.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:28.670
It reminds me of what
my parents listened to.

01:03:28.671 --> 01:03:31.540
Sure, yeah, okay.

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:33.608
Great.

01:03:33.609 --> 01:03:35.329
There's a new bar that
just opened downtown

01:03:35.353 --> 01:03:37.279
I've been dying to check it out.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.114
I heard they have a great band.

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:41.984
I'll see what time
the show starts.

01:03:49.325 --> 01:03:52.027
Megan, here is a hot chocolate
with whipped cream.

01:03:52.028 --> 01:03:54.095
Thank you.

01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:56.231
And a coffee for
you, young lady.

01:03:56.232 --> 01:03:57.399
Harold.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.600
You're not gonna believe this.

01:03:58.601 --> 01:04:00.468
- I... I got the job.
- Whoa.

01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:03.738
I am officially employed
as a party planner.

01:04:03.739 --> 01:04:05.974
And it's in the city.

01:04:05.975 --> 01:04:08.410
You're welcome.

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:10.579
Thank you for this too.

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:14.749
So, um, how did your date go?

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:17.319
Did slow dancing sweep
her off her feet?

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.554
Not exactly.

01:04:19.555 --> 01:04:22.791
She, uh, really wasn't up
for a quiet evening in.

01:04:22.792 --> 01:04:24.926
She always wants to go out

01:04:24.927 --> 01:04:27.162
and do something...

01:04:27.163 --> 01:04:29.231
Something fast and furious.

01:04:29.232 --> 01:04:32.100
Ah, well, believe it or not,

01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:34.135
this is actually a good thing.

01:04:34.136 --> 01:04:36.905
You're starting to see
each other's differences.

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:39.341
Which brings us to
our next topic.

01:04:39.342 --> 01:04:41.610
The subject of give and take.

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:44.946
Compromise is essential to
making any relationship work.

01:04:44.947 --> 01:04:48.350
So what do you suggest I do?

01:04:48.351 --> 01:04:49.951
Well, since you gave
on the dancing bit,

01:04:49.975 --> 01:04:51.553
I say switch it around.

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:53.888
Invite her to do something
you really want to do.

01:04:53.889 --> 01:04:55.824
- You think?
- Yeah.

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:59.461
If you want to be someone,
you find ways to compromise.

01:04:59.462 --> 01:05:03.798
And who wouldn't want to
spend time with you, Harold?

01:05:03.799 --> 01:05:05.200
I think that's the nicest thing

01:05:05.201 --> 01:05:08.803
anybody's ever said to me.

01:05:08.804 --> 01:05:10.005
Hold still for a second.

01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:12.073
No.

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:13.808
No, stop.

01:05:13.809 --> 01:05:17.379
No way, I never pass
up a beautiful photo.

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:18.513
Okay, that's enough.

01:05:18.514 --> 01:05:19.681
That's good, that's good.

01:05:19.682 --> 01:05:21.082
You know what, I'm taking photos

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:23.151
out by the lake tomorrow,
you want to come along?

01:05:23.152 --> 01:05:24.519
Why?

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:29.791
No reason, I just...
I like your company.

01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:31.293
Okay.

01:05:31.294 --> 01:05:33.662
I'll pick you up at 5:00 then.

01:05:33.663 --> 01:05:35.431
Wait, in the morning?

01:05:39.101 --> 01:05:40.835
Whew.

01:05:40.836 --> 01:05:43.038
Do you always get up this
early to take pictures?

01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:44.506
Well, I have to.

01:05:44.507 --> 01:05:46.808
The light is perfect
this time of day.

01:05:46.809 --> 01:05:48.510
It's magic hour, you know?

01:05:48.511 --> 01:05:50.312
Magic hour?

01:05:50.313 --> 01:05:55.550
Yeah, um, well, it's
soft, you know?

01:05:55.551 --> 01:05:58.920
Everything has this
nice, beautiful...

01:05:58.921 --> 01:06:01.456
Like, a golden look about it.

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:03.758
It only happens at
sunrise and sunset.

01:06:03.759 --> 01:06:04.993
Mm.

01:06:04.994 --> 01:06:06.161
You want to take a look?

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:08.530
- Go ahead.
- Yeah.

01:06:08.531 --> 01:06:10.332
Oh, wow.

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:12.501
That's pretty.

01:06:14.537 --> 01:06:18.807
I feel free out here, you know?

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:20.975
- Does that sound weird?
- No, not at all.

01:06:20.976 --> 01:06:23.378
I love being out here this
time of day, it's like...

01:06:23.379 --> 01:06:27.182
Well, it's like the whole
world is just waking up.

01:06:27.183 --> 01:06:29.884
Yeah.

01:06:29.885 --> 01:06:33.421
So this event I'm planning...

01:06:33.422 --> 01:06:36.691
It's a fundraiser to
preserve our parks.

01:06:36.692 --> 01:06:37.792
Well, that's a great cause.

01:06:37.793 --> 01:06:39.227
It is, yeah.

01:06:39.228 --> 01:06:41.563
And what I'm thinking
is we could feature

01:06:41.564 --> 01:06:43.465
your gorgeous landscapes.

01:06:44.867 --> 01:06:46.368
No, come on, think about it.

01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:49.104
You know, photos everywhere
of what we're trying to save?

01:06:49.105 --> 01:06:53.641
And you'd get some free
advertising out of it.

01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:55.610
You interested?

01:06:55.611 --> 01:06:56.778
- Are you kidding?
- No.

01:06:56.779 --> 01:06:59.013
Yeah, of course I'm in.
How great.

01:06:59.014 --> 01:07:01.684
All right.

01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:07.655
I love this.

01:07:07.656 --> 01:07:10.558
We definitely have
to use this one.

01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:12.193
Oh, are you sure
it's good enough?

01:07:12.194 --> 01:07:13.561
Absolutely.

01:07:13.562 --> 01:07:15.163
It's beautiful.

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:17.232
Don't question my good taste.

01:07:17.233 --> 01:07:19.868
Sorry, my mistake.

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:22.337
You can really see that
look of magic hour

01:07:22.338 --> 01:07:26.374
you were talking about.

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:28.744
Somebody was paying attention.

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:32.747
It's like, um...

01:07:32.748 --> 01:07:35.984
A picture out of a fairy
tale or something,

01:07:35.985 --> 01:07:39.455
where it's all soft and glowing.

01:07:41.457 --> 01:07:42.857
- Come here.
- What?

01:07:42.858 --> 01:07:44.659
- Come here.
- Why?

01:07:47.663 --> 01:07:49.664
You mean...?

01:07:49.665 --> 01:07:50.799
- No.
- Please?

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.000
No, no.

01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:53.521
Julie doesn't like
this kind of music.

01:07:53.545 --> 01:07:56.471
I don't have anybody
to dance with.

01:07:56.472 --> 01:07:59.774
And Matt Schneider isn't around
to steal you away from me.

01:07:59.775 --> 01:08:01.415
I can't believe you're
guilt-tripping me.

01:08:01.439 --> 01:08:02.877
Mm-hmm.

01:08:02.878 --> 01:08:04.718
You're never gonna let
me forget that, are you?

01:08:04.742 --> 01:08:06.014
Probably not.

01:08:06.015 --> 01:08:08.917
Come on, dance with me.

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:11.820
♪ What went wrong ♪

01:08:11.821 --> 01:08:14.556
Well, I guess I do owe you one.

01:08:14.557 --> 01:08:15.890
♪ ♪

01:08:15.891 --> 01:08:20.629

♪ Sometimes we're blinded,
don't you know? ♪

01:08:28.571 --> 01:08:32.474
So after that dance
we went to...

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:34.108
Mm-hmm.

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:37.444
You dropped me off and
walked me to the door

01:08:37.446 --> 01:08:40.682
and kissed me good night.

01:08:40.683 --> 01:08:42.517
No.

01:08:42.518 --> 01:08:44.618
- No?
- No.

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:49.090
Um, you sat in the front
seat with my mother.

01:08:49.091 --> 01:08:52.393
When we dropped you off,
you waved good-bye.

01:08:52.394 --> 01:08:55.596
And that was it.

01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:59.100
I think that was the last
time we spoke in high school.

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:03.904
♪ Suspecting all along ♪

01:09:03.906 --> 01:09:07.008

01:09:07.009 --> 01:09:11.746
Are you sure you didn't

Yes.

01:09:15.184 --> 01:09:17.484

So you and Denise should have
a good refund this year.

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:36.671
Just increase the deductions
on your paychecks.

01:09:36.671 --> 01:09:38.139
You got it.

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:41.242
Hey, how are things
going with Julie?

01:09:41.243 --> 01:09:42.877
Oh, they're going great.

01:09:42.877 --> 01:09:44.345
Good.

01:09:44.345 --> 01:09:46.247
Hey, what are you working on?

01:09:46.247 --> 01:09:47.814
A new landscape?

01:09:47.816 --> 01:09:50.419
No, it's just a
work in progress...

01:09:53.589 --> 01:09:55.189
Ah, pictures of people.

01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:58.059
The man is breaking new ground.

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:01.930
This isn't Julie.

01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:05.600
Does somebody have a
crush on his coach?

01:10:05.601 --> 01:10:07.769
- I don't.
- Mm-hmm.

01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:09.771
You should go work on
your taxes, don't you...

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:19.213
And to celebrate...

01:10:19.214 --> 01:10:21.115
- Whoa.
- Ta-da!

01:10:21.116 --> 01:10:23.217
Uh, what is that?

01:10:23.218 --> 01:10:25.119
Uh, I don't know, it
was all we had left

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:28.222
when I closed up last night.

01:10:28.223 --> 01:10:29.557
Banana cream, I think.

01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:31.159
Not bad.

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.794
And what's the candle for?

01:10:32.795 --> 01:10:34.162
Well, I wanted to
add some flair.

01:10:34.163 --> 01:10:36.598
I know it's a birthday
candle, but who cares?

01:10:36.599 --> 01:10:39.167
We're celebrating
your graduation.

01:10:39.168 --> 01:10:41.103
Go, blow it out.

01:10:45.007 --> 01:10:46.727
There's still one more
lesson though, right?

01:10:46.751 --> 01:10:49.287
True, but first a toast.

01:10:52.815 --> 01:10:55.383
It's official,
you're a heartthrob.

01:10:57.686 --> 01:11:01.623
And one of the
nicest guys I know.

01:11:01.624 --> 01:11:04.525
I hope Julie knows how
lucky she is to have you.

01:11:04.526 --> 01:11:09.063
But most of all, here's
to your happiness

01:11:09.064 --> 01:11:12.133
because you deserve it.

01:11:12.134 --> 01:11:13.701
Do I get to say a few words?

01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:16.037
By all means.

01:11:16.038 --> 01:11:18.172
A toast, back to you.

01:11:18.173 --> 01:11:20.842
I learned from the best.

01:11:20.843 --> 01:11:22.310
And I also got to
spend a lot time

01:11:22.311 --> 01:11:25.747
with the prettiest
girl in high school,

01:11:25.748 --> 01:11:28.650
who I always had a crush on.

01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:30.551
You did?

01:11:30.552 --> 01:11:34.422
I did.

01:11:34.423 --> 01:11:37.558
Huh.

01:11:37.559 --> 01:11:41.896
Okay, final lesson.

01:11:41.897 --> 01:11:45.667
And this is probably the
most important thing

01:11:45.668 --> 01:11:47.201
I will ever teach you.

01:11:47.202 --> 01:11:49.370
I call it my golden rule.

01:11:49.371 --> 01:11:51.205
Okay.

01:11:51.206 --> 01:11:52.540
There's not a lot to it.

01:11:52.541 --> 01:11:55.276
It's just something you
should always remember.

01:11:55.277 --> 01:12:00.615
When in doubt, trust your gut.

01:12:00.616 --> 01:12:02.517
Follow your heart.

01:12:02.518 --> 01:12:07.589
And always, always be honest...

01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:13.495
With yourself and with
the person you're with.

01:12:28.277 --> 01:12:30.946
Oh, uh... Aah!

01:12:33.348 --> 01:12:35.583
It's so wet and muddy.

01:12:35.584 --> 01:12:38.986
Are we there yet?

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:47.562
Here it is.

01:12:47.563 --> 01:12:49.497
This is it?

01:12:49.498 --> 01:12:51.566
There's not, like, a
beach or something?

01:12:51.567 --> 01:12:54.470
No, I told you it was a
little more rustic than that.

01:12:56.438 --> 01:12:58.873
Oh, great, my shoes are ruined.

01:12:58.874 --> 01:13:01.242
I just bought them.

01:13:03.011 --> 01:13:05.113
Are you almost finished?

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:07.248
Have you taken everything
you need to take?

01:13:07.249 --> 01:13:09.450
The light isn't
really what I want.

01:13:09.451 --> 01:13:12.086
This was supposed to be
an early morning trip.

01:13:12.087 --> 01:13:14.388
Well, the party ran
late last night.

01:13:14.389 --> 01:13:16.069
I didn't get to bed
till 2:00 this morning.

01:13:16.093 --> 01:13:18.528
I overslept.

01:13:19.895 --> 01:13:21.129
What's wrong?

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:23.531
Nothing, just not gonna
get anything I can use.

01:13:23.532 --> 01:13:27.769
Great, does that mean
we can leave now?

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:29.337
Yeah.

01:13:29.338 --> 01:13:31.373
Okay.

01:13:51.593 --> 01:13:54.028
You just have the best
laugh in the world.

01:13:54.029 --> 01:13:56.364
Aww.

01:13:56.365 --> 01:13:57.532
- I gotta get going.
- Yeah.

01:13:57.533 --> 01:13:59.467
Thank you so much
for stopping in.

01:13:59.468 --> 01:14:00.668
It was great to see you, Matt.

01:14:00.692 --> 01:14:01.769
Yeah, I'll see you soon.

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:03.738
- Bye.
- You're the best, Annie.

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:06.107
She is the best.

01:14:06.108 --> 01:14:07.775
Nice to meet you, handsome Matt.

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:11.013
Take care.

01:14:17.986 --> 01:14:21.689
- Kim.
- Oh, yeah.

01:14:21.690 --> 01:14:23.124
Is that guy's name Matt?

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:25.126
Yeah, yeah, that's Matt.

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:27.461
Did you get his last name?

01:14:27.462 --> 01:14:29.330
I forget his last name.

01:14:29.331 --> 01:14:31.766
He's a high-school
friend of Annie's.

01:14:31.767 --> 01:14:33.000
Is it Matt Schneider?

01:14:33.001 --> 01:14:36.637
Yes, Matt Schneider.

01:14:36.638 --> 01:14:39.273
You okay?

01:14:39.274 --> 01:14:40.441
Hey, Harold.

01:14:40.442 --> 01:14:43.311
Hi, I didn't know you were here.

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:44.846
Why didn't you say hi?

01:14:44.847 --> 01:14:48.816
Uh, you were busy. I
didn't want to interrupt.

01:14:48.817 --> 01:14:51.519
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, you okay?

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:54.489
Yeah.

01:14:56.525 --> 01:14:59.994
Um, I found an
apartment in the city.

01:14:59.995 --> 01:15:02.163
I'm gonna be moving there.

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:03.264
When?

01:15:03.265 --> 01:15:05.299
Pretty much right away.

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:09.370
Mm. Well...

01:15:09.371 --> 01:15:14.041
Great it's all coming
together for you.

01:15:14.042 --> 01:15:17.778
Seems like all your dreams
are coming true, huh?

01:15:17.779 --> 01:15:20.348
Yeah.

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:25.019
I owe you big-time, Harold.

01:15:27.289 --> 01:15:30.458
It's Julie.

01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:34.061
Oh, take it, yeah.

01:15:34.062 --> 01:15:37.431
Hello.

01:15:37.432 --> 01:15:39.634
Okay.

01:15:39.635 --> 01:15:41.335
I'll see you then.

01:15:41.336 --> 01:15:44.273
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

01:15:47.643 --> 01:15:52.179
Um, I just wanted to...

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:54.415
What?

01:15:54.416 --> 01:15:59.353
I just was gonna
say, um, thank you

01:15:59.354 --> 01:16:02.224
for helping me get that job.

01:16:04.426 --> 01:16:07.329
You deserve it.

01:16:25.013 --> 01:16:26.814
How was your last shift?

01:16:26.815 --> 01:16:28.482
Great.

01:16:28.483 --> 01:16:31.052
Sounds like it.

01:16:31.053 --> 01:16:33.921
I'm moving out tomorrow.

01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:36.157
I thought you were
leaving on Saturday.

01:16:36.158 --> 01:16:39.160
No, my apartment's
ready in the city,

01:16:39.161 --> 01:16:43.030
and there's no reason
for me to stay.

01:16:43.031 --> 01:16:45.766
The sooner, the better, right?

01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:48.536
You could stay if you want.

01:16:48.537 --> 01:16:50.705
What?

01:16:50.706 --> 01:16:52.146
I thought you wanted
me to move out.

01:16:52.170 --> 01:16:54.075
Wasn't that the whole point?

01:16:54.076 --> 01:16:57.545
No, I...

01:16:57.546 --> 01:17:00.614
It's... it's really hard to
stand out in this family

01:17:00.615 --> 01:17:02.783
when the kid sister is you.

01:17:02.784 --> 01:17:04.418
What?

01:17:04.419 --> 01:17:06.887
I guess I've always
resented that.

01:17:06.888 --> 01:17:10.791
Uh, have you been drinking?

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:15.196
Because if not, maybe now's
not a bad time to start.

01:17:15.197 --> 01:17:18.532
I'm serious. You
were the baby...

01:17:18.533 --> 01:17:20.693
The pretty one that got to
go out and have a good time.

01:17:20.694 --> 01:17:22.228
But I had to make
a good example,

01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:24.271
so I just did what I was told.

01:17:24.272 --> 01:17:27.174
Okay, first of all, you're nuts.

01:17:27.175 --> 01:17:29.410
Second of all, I was
the one who couldn't

01:17:29.411 --> 01:17:31.412
measure up to you.

01:17:31.413 --> 01:17:32.646
Do you know how
many times I heard,

01:17:32.647 --> 01:17:34.115
"why can't you be
more like Claire?"

01:17:34.116 --> 01:17:35.349
When we were growing up?

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:37.918
- No, you did not.
- I did so.

01:17:37.919 --> 01:17:40.688
Mom and dad worshipped
you, and you know it.

01:17:40.689 --> 01:17:43.524
- I don't think so.
- Well, I know so.

01:17:43.525 --> 01:17:44.792
And I'm right.

01:17:44.793 --> 01:17:47.596
You're wrong, forever
and infinity, so there.

01:17:49.765 --> 01:17:54.068
I am so proud of you.
You are so brave.

01:17:54.069 --> 01:17:57.405
Going out there and
living your dreams.

01:17:57.406 --> 01:18:00.609
Doing all the things I never
had the courage to do.

01:18:02.811 --> 01:18:07.248
And I think you are a
huge success in life.

01:18:07.249 --> 01:18:10.718
Having a home, a family,

01:18:10.719 --> 01:18:14.055
all the things that
really matter.

01:18:14.056 --> 01:18:17.091
So we both want
what the other has.

01:18:17.092 --> 01:18:20.027
We're quite the pair.

01:18:20.028 --> 01:18:23.664
I guess so.

01:18:23.665 --> 01:18:27.568
I'm really sorry for making
things hard for you.

01:18:27.569 --> 01:18:30.271
I'm sorry too.

01:18:30.272 --> 01:18:33.574
I really look up to you.
I always have.

01:18:33.575 --> 01:18:36.044
I want you to know that.

01:18:38.447 --> 01:18:41.916
Will you teach me how not
to be a loser in life?

01:18:41.917 --> 01:18:44.085
Baby, you are not a loser.

01:18:44.086 --> 01:18:47.521
You're brilliant at
everything you do.

01:18:47.522 --> 01:18:51.892
And I want you know, I have
always thought that about you.

01:18:51.893 --> 01:18:53.060
Really?

01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:55.831
Yes, really.

01:19:01.369 --> 01:19:03.404
What's wrong?

01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:07.842
Nothing, nothing.

01:19:07.843 --> 01:19:10.812
Just the man of my
dreams is already taken.

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:27.661
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:19:27.662 --> 01:19:29.864
Thanks for coming.

01:19:29.865 --> 01:19:31.799
Do you want to get something?

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:35.069
No, no, I'm fine.

01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:37.371
Julie, there's something
I wanted to t...

01:19:37.372 --> 01:19:40.107
Before you do, there's
something I need to say first.

01:19:40.108 --> 01:19:41.375
- This can't wait, I...
- No.

01:19:41.376 --> 01:19:44.078
Really, please.

01:19:44.079 --> 01:19:48.048
I've been thinking about
a lot of things...

01:19:48.049 --> 01:19:49.950
About us.

01:19:49.951 --> 01:19:54.755
And I just think that we're
two very different people,

01:19:54.756 --> 01:19:58.792
which is why I think we should
stop seeing each other.

01:19:58.793 --> 01:20:01.595
Are you saying you don't
want to see my anymore?

01:20:01.596 --> 01:20:04.031
I hope you understand.

01:20:04.032 --> 01:20:06.300
I think it's for the best.

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:08.135
No, that's great.

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:10.070
I mean, it's not
great, I'm just...

01:20:10.071 --> 01:20:14.675
I'm glad that we're
on the same page.

01:20:14.676 --> 01:20:18.245
I guess so.

01:20:18.246 --> 01:20:22.650
Look, Julie, I want to thank
you for being honest.

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:25.587
Because I really think
that's the best way.

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:28.757
Yeah.

01:20:31.226 --> 01:20:33.561
You take care.

01:20:33.562 --> 01:20:35.997
Good-bye, Harold.

01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:48.042
Take that picture, and put
it in the corner over there.

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:51.212
Thank you.

01:20:51.213 --> 01:20:52.313
Are you the Annie Hayes

01:20:52.314 --> 01:20:54.548
responsible for putting
all this together?

01:20:54.549 --> 01:20:56.717
Um, that depends,
do you like it?

01:20:56.718 --> 01:20:58.118
I love it.

01:20:58.119 --> 01:21:01.322
- Then I'm Annie Hayes.
- And I'm Malcolm Winters.

01:21:01.323 --> 01:21:02.423
Hi.

01:21:02.424 --> 01:21:04.992
This is amazing.

01:21:04.993 --> 01:21:07.194
My hobby is photography.

01:21:07.195 --> 01:21:09.597
But whoever did these
is a true artist.

01:21:09.598 --> 01:21:11.332
His name's Harold White.

01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:15.169
Listen, my company's having
its Diamond Jubilee.

01:21:15.170 --> 01:21:18.072
I'd like to talk to you
about it, here's my card.

01:21:18.073 --> 01:21:20.674
Give my office a call next
week and set something up.

01:21:20.675 --> 01:21:23.711
I will, thank you.

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:25.379
That's great.

01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:26.747
You're staying for the party?

01:21:26.748 --> 01:21:28.048
Oh, I wouldn't miss it.

01:21:28.049 --> 01:21:30.484
And I can introduce you to
my photographer friend.

01:21:30.485 --> 01:21:32.853
I love his work. See you later.

01:21:32.854 --> 01:21:35.390
Okay.

01:21:36.858 --> 01:21:38.025
Great job.

01:21:38.026 --> 01:21:40.428
Thank you.

01:21:50.071 --> 01:21:52.072
Harold, why aren't
you in the city?

01:21:52.073 --> 01:21:54.375
Doesn't the party start at 7:00?

01:21:54.376 --> 01:21:55.976
I just wanted to leave
this for Annie.

01:21:55.977 --> 01:21:57.777
For you to give her the
next time you see her.

01:21:57.801 --> 01:22:00.537
Can I see?

01:22:03.785 --> 01:22:05.953
Mommy, look, it's me and Annie.

01:22:05.954 --> 01:22:08.055
I also, um, wrote a letter

01:22:08.056 --> 01:22:10.958
explaining to Annie why I
wouldn't be there tonight.

01:22:10.959 --> 01:22:14.028
I don't understand why you're
not going to the party.

01:22:14.029 --> 01:22:16.764
You got Annie the job, your
photos are on display.

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:18.165
Well, there's only so many times

01:22:18.166 --> 01:22:21.935
I can let myself be
rejected by Annie.

01:22:21.936 --> 01:22:23.972
What are you talking about?

01:22:25.974 --> 01:22:29.943
I had a bad experience a
bunch of a years ago.

01:22:29.944 --> 01:22:31.879
Annie and Matt Schneider
were a big part of it,

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:34.014
and I don't want to go
through that again.

01:22:34.015 --> 01:22:37.184
I'm sorry, I'm...
I'm confused here.

01:22:37.185 --> 01:22:40.155
Me too.

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:45.025
Matt Schneider
really likes Annie.

01:22:45.026 --> 01:22:48.562
She seems to like him too.

01:22:48.563 --> 01:22:51.365
You really don't get it.

01:22:51.366 --> 01:22:54.568
Annie likes you.

01:22:54.569 --> 01:22:57.805
Annie told mommy that you
were the man of her dreams.

01:22:57.806 --> 01:23:00.441
She did? She said that?

01:23:00.442 --> 01:23:01.542
Those were her exact words,

01:23:01.543 --> 01:23:05.045
except she thought
you were taken.

01:23:05.046 --> 01:23:07.515
You can still make it.

01:23:13.888 --> 01:23:16.457
Before I turn the evening
over to dancing,

01:23:16.458 --> 01:23:18.826
I'd like to thank our donors.

01:23:23.231 --> 01:23:25.432
For all of you who have been
admiring the impressive

01:23:25.433 --> 01:23:27.534
images around the room,
I'd like to introduce

01:23:27.535 --> 01:23:29.470
the photographer.

01:23:29.471 --> 01:23:31.673
Is Harold White in the room?

01:23:36.111 --> 01:23:39.481
Mr. White?

01:23:44.486 --> 01:23:47.721
Hi, I'm Harold.

01:23:47.722 --> 01:23:50.524
Mr. White has offered to
donate all the proceeds

01:23:50.525 --> 01:23:52.526
from the sale of his photographs

01:23:52.527 --> 01:23:55.195
to help us save our parklands.

01:23:57.365 --> 01:24:01.001
Thank you, sir.

01:24:01.002 --> 01:24:02.669
Thank you, everyone.

01:24:02.670 --> 01:24:06.273
Uh, I need to thank
someone special.

01:24:06.274 --> 01:24:10.644
She's the person who put
this whole party together.

01:24:10.645 --> 01:24:13.247
She's a woman of many talents.

01:24:13.248 --> 01:24:17.317
And, uh, I'm living
proof of that.

01:24:17.318 --> 01:24:19.019
Her name is Annie Hayes.

01:24:24.826 --> 01:24:27.227
Annie and I knew each other
a little in high school,

01:24:27.228 --> 01:24:29.930
but recently, I've
had the chance

01:24:29.931 --> 01:24:33.801
to get to know her much better.

01:24:33.802 --> 01:24:36.403
She's taught me a
lot about who I am,

01:24:36.404 --> 01:24:38.873
who I want to be.

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:44.344
I don't know how I'm ever

01:24:44.345 --> 01:24:47.048
gonna thank her for everything.

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:54.488
Annie, I like my life so
much more with you in it.

01:24:54.489 --> 01:24:57.392
I'd like to keep it that way.

01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:04.498
Oh, and, uh, I agree with you.

01:25:04.499 --> 01:25:06.300
I think this would make
an excellent choice

01:25:06.301 --> 01:25:09.938

Can this be our song?

01:25:39.033 --> 01:25:42.970

great taste in music.
