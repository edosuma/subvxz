00:10.445 --> 00:12.621
<i>Hawk, I came to say thank you</i>

00:12.664 --> 00:15.145
<i>for saving me </i>
<i>from that cult of demonic teens.</i>

00:15.189 --> 00:18.018
Who knew Satan's greatest
weakness was kung fu?

00:18.061 --> 00:19.410
You don't have to thank me,
Diana.

00:19.454 --> 00:20.759
It's my job.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.500
Whether it's a cult
of demonic teens,

00:22.544 --> 00:24.415
a cyborg serial killer

00:24.459 --> 00:27.505
or just a pack of rabid bears
that escape the zoo.

00:27.549 --> 00:29.116
Whenever crime comes a-knockin',

00:29.159 --> 00:32.206
I'll be there to answer
the caw-caw!

00:33.816 --> 00:36.079
<i>Next time on</i> Hawk's Shadow.

00:40.127 --> 00:42.085
- What was that?
- Oh. Come on.

00:42.129 --> 00:45.393
Look, it was the '90s. It takes
more episodes to get into it.

00:45.436 --> 00:47.047
Okay, let's watch one more.No, no, no, no, no.

00:47.090 --> 00:48.831
Okay, let's not watch
any more...

00:48.874 --> 00:52.226
There's enough real-life drama
going on right now. Um...

00:52.269 --> 00:54.097
I-I've been meaning
to check in with you,

00:54.141 --> 00:55.446
ask how you're doing

00:55.490 --> 00:57.448
since Miles,
um, see if you're okay.

00:58.797 --> 01:00.756
I don't know.

01:00.799 --> 01:02.932
I, uh...

01:02.975 --> 01:05.239
Yeah, I was
pretty torn up,

01:05.282 --> 01:07.415
being so wrong
about Captain Cole.

01:08.677 --> 01:11.984
But, two weeks out,

01:12.028 --> 01:13.899
it was cathartic.

01:13.943 --> 01:15.249
Get some closure.

01:15.292 --> 01:17.512
Good.

01:17.555 --> 01:18.600
How 'bout you?

01:18.643 --> 01:19.862
You talk to Geri?

01:19.905 --> 01:22.125
No. Not really.

01:22.169 --> 01:24.693
You know, she's out
of town right now.

01:24.736 --> 01:28.262
She's on a girls' trip
with Gale and Denise.

01:28.305 --> 01:32.440
And I-I totally get that-that
she-she feels like she needs

01:32.483 --> 01:33.832
to get to know them. You know?

01:33.876 --> 01:35.791
I guess I
thought that if

01:35.834 --> 01:38.141
we were gonna give "us" a go,

01:38.185 --> 01:40.752
it was gonna be, um, you
know, all gas, no brakes.

01:40.796 --> 01:43.538
And now I-I feel, uh...

01:43.581 --> 01:45.105
I guess I feel betrayed.

01:45.148 --> 01:47.629
I mean, Geri is
my best friend,

01:47.672 --> 01:53.287
and it feels like she chose
them and that family over...

01:53.330 --> 01:55.289
me and-and my family.

01:55.332 --> 01:56.899
And if you can't...

01:56.942 --> 02:00.555
trust your best friend
to stick by ya, then...

02:00.598 --> 02:03.123
You can always trust
your partner.

02:04.080 --> 02:05.995
Oh.

02:06.038 --> 02:07.562
Server's been accessed.

02:07.605 --> 02:09.172
Perp should be coming out
any minute.

02:09.216 --> 02:10.739
Okay. All right.

02:10.782 --> 02:12.175
Catch me back up,
- uh, crypto queen.
- Mm.

02:12.219 --> 02:13.655
Give me the quick 30 seconds.

02:13.698 --> 02:15.700
The server that holds
the firm's crypto wallets

02:15.744 --> 02:17.441
Right.
approved
unauthorized transactions

02:17.485 --> 02:19.704
- twice in the past month.
- Right.

02:19.748 --> 02:22.185
So the firm thinks that
it's an inside job because...

02:22.229 --> 02:23.273
Okay. Yep. I got it,
I got it.

02:23.317 --> 02:24.796
All right, good.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.146
- Oh.
- Could be him.

02:26.189 --> 02:27.669
Yeah.

02:27.712 --> 02:29.671
Yeah.

02:32.674 --> 02:33.849
Excuse me.

02:33.892 --> 02:35.155
Texas Rangers.

02:35.198 --> 02:37.766
We'd like to ask you
a couple questions.

02:49.908 --> 02:51.345
Hey! Stop him!

02:51.388 --> 02:53.260
Stop him! Stop!

02:54.739 --> 02:56.219
Walker, wait! Wait,
wait, wait, wait!

02:56.263 --> 02:57.786
- What? What are you doing?
- The double "H" logo

02:57.829 --> 02:59.962
stands for
"Harwick Hospitality."He's in there!

03:00.005 --> 03:01.790
It's two brothers who own a
ton of nightclubs in Texas.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.270
- Cassie!
- I used to go to Sandy's

03:03.313 --> 03:04.880
back in Dallas.

03:04.923 --> 03:06.316
Pretty good vibe, but
drinks are super steep.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.144
Okay...But they loved
their exits.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.537
You would move
to the back,

03:09.580 --> 03:11.495
down a hallway and
out a second door.

03:11.539 --> 03:13.149
So you would never
see people leaving,

03:13.193 --> 03:14.672
only more people
- coming in to party.
- Cassie,

03:14.716 --> 03:16.065
what-what is your point?
Because he's gonna get away.

03:16.108 --> 03:18.328
My point is...

03:18.372 --> 03:20.200
What?

03:20.243 --> 03:21.549
Do you trust me?

03:21.592 --> 03:22.593
Wh-What?

03:25.683 --> 03:27.076
- Whoa.

03:28.730 --> 03:29.557
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't move! Don't move!

03:29.600 --> 03:30.775
Don't move!

03:30.819 --> 03:31.863
Caw-caw!

03:31.907 --> 03:33.604
Caw-caw!

03:34.170 --> 03:37.304
No, no. That's not even
a-a sound the hawk makes.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.012
And I talked to DJ
on the way over here.

03:50.055 --> 03:53.058
- Yeah?
- Finally got him to tell
me about chem class.

03:53.102 --> 03:54.799
Oh... shoot.
Oh.

03:54.843 --> 03:55.887
I was supposed to prep you
for that.
It's okay.

03:55.931 --> 03:57.106
I forgot.

03:57.149 --> 03:58.934
Hey, you forgot...

04:00.892 --> 04:02.111
...this.

04:03.155 --> 04:06.289
Didn't exactly have it together
when I left the other night.

04:07.638 --> 04:10.293
Um, you know, DJ floated
the idea of going to the beach

04:10.337 --> 04:12.164
when he's back from Boise
for the summer.

04:12.208 --> 04:14.515
I was thinking
we could all go.

04:14.558 --> 04:16.734
Together.

04:16.778 --> 04:18.562
How would you feel about that?

04:18.606 --> 04:20.434
Wow.

04:21.391 --> 04:23.437
That sounds like fun.

04:24.960 --> 04:25.917
Fun?

04:25.961 --> 04:27.441
Hell yes. Of course.

04:27.484 --> 04:29.094
I mean, obviously, depends
on work, but, definitely,

04:29.138 --> 04:31.880
yeah, that-that
could be a lot of fun.

04:31.923 --> 04:33.316
If we are doing this--

04:33.360 --> 04:36.145
and I am not saying
that we're doing this...

04:36.188 --> 04:38.190
I know, I know, I know.
I need to be more present.

04:38.234 --> 04:41.498
Open line of, uh,
communication, right?

04:41.542 --> 04:42.586
Right.

04:42.630 --> 04:44.284
- Right.
- Right.

04:44.327 --> 04:47.025
Listen, I-I have to run. Um...

04:47.069 --> 04:49.898
Thank you for
the jacket and...

04:49.941 --> 04:51.116
the coffee.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.292
Okay.

04:52.335 --> 04:54.294
- Okay. Yeah.
- I'll see you.

04:58.646 --> 05:01.170
You suck at girls.

05:04.869 --> 05:06.828
How come everything's
painted white?

05:15.880 --> 05:16.968
Look at this!

05:17.012 --> 05:19.928
Precious family time together.

05:19.971 --> 05:21.408
We're looking at ranches.

05:21.451 --> 05:23.061
- Anything promising?
- Mm.

05:23.105 --> 05:24.498
Pickings are slim.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.456
Well, cost an arm
and a leg to...

05:26.500 --> 05:28.284
get a ranch up
and running anyway.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.852
Yeah, maybe it's time to put
this cowboy out to pasture.

05:30.895 --> 05:32.027
All right, Daddy.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.594
Uh, Stella Blue.

05:33.637 --> 05:35.335
Good morningto you.

05:35.378 --> 05:38.599
Um, heard anything back
from Sauber yet?

05:38.642 --> 05:40.296
Oh, that's that school
from Oregon, right?

05:40.340 --> 05:41.210
- That's right. That's
her first choice.

05:41.253 --> 05:42.690
See? I-I know things.

05:42.733 --> 05:44.213
I listen.

05:44.256 --> 05:46.346
Um, not yet.

05:46.389 --> 05:49.131
But last day for letters
is next week, so...

05:49.174 --> 05:50.611
there's still time.

05:50.654 --> 05:52.134
Okay. All right, well,
I-I wouldn't worry.

05:52.177 --> 05:53.788
You got this, Blue.

05:57.531 --> 05:58.575
Hey.

05:58.619 --> 05:59.968
Stella,

06:00.011 --> 06:01.491
you want to go see some ranches
with us?

06:01.535 --> 06:04.581
Um, I was actually thinking
of hanging with Todd

06:04.625 --> 06:06.888
and his brother today,
if that's okay.

06:06.931 --> 06:08.803
Of course.

06:24.035 --> 06:24.993
Walker.

06:25.036 --> 06:26.516
It is...Yeah.

06:26.560 --> 06:27.952
- ...9:47.
- Uh, yes, sir.

06:27.996 --> 06:29.867
9:48. Uh...

06:29.911 --> 06:32.261
let's go with 9:47.
Sure. Sorry.

06:32.304 --> 06:33.741
I-I went to
go see a...

06:33.784 --> 06:35.046
a new ranch with the family.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.787
- Uh, where we at?
- I was catching Perez up

06:36.831 --> 06:38.223
on the, uh, perp
you nabbed last night.

06:38.267 --> 06:39.442
Wh-Whoa. Excuse me.

06:39.486 --> 06:40.617
I nabbed. I am the nabber.

06:40.661 --> 06:41.575
Okay.

06:41.618 --> 06:43.446
His name's
Matthew Ryan.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.840
He worked I.T.
for Drexen Wealth Management.

06:45.883 --> 06:48.364
He confessed to stealing
100 grand in cryptocurrency.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.887
He was gonna use it
to buy a million

06:49.931 --> 06:51.454
in counterfeit cash
through a middleman

06:51.498 --> 06:52.629
he found on the dark web.

06:52.673 --> 06:53.804
Did he give up
the middleman?

06:53.848 --> 06:55.371
Maybe if we track him down,

06:55.415 --> 06:56.720
we can use him to get
to the counterfeiter.

06:56.764 --> 06:58.505
Yeah, about that.
Walker, there's something

06:58.548 --> 06:59.593
that you specifically
should know.

06:59.636 --> 07:02.073
The middleman
is Eric Davies.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.207
Er-Eric Davies?
Eric-Eric Davies?

07:05.250 --> 07:06.338
Like-like
that-that

07:06.382 --> 07:08.428
- Eric Davies?
- Eric Davies.

07:08.471 --> 07:11.082
Okay, the loop is over there
and I'm-I'm right here.

07:11.126 --> 07:12.997
So, who is
Eric Davies?

07:13.041 --> 07:14.477
I worked undercover
on a-- on a case

07:14.521 --> 07:15.391
with a gang
of bank robbers

07:15.435 --> 07:16.479
named the Rodeo Kings

07:16.523 --> 07:17.611
and...Yes, I'm-I'm aware.

07:17.654 --> 07:19.308
- Is Eric a Rodeo King?
- No.

07:19.351 --> 07:21.484
But he was married to one.

07:21.528 --> 07:22.529
Uh, Twyla.

07:22.572 --> 07:23.486
Walker ran
a sting op,

07:23.530 --> 07:24.618
put her in jail.

07:24.661 --> 07:26.054
Few weeks later,
she fed us intel

07:26.097 --> 07:27.142
on Clint West
when he escaped prison.

07:27.185 --> 07:29.187
- Oh.
Hold on a sec.

07:29.231 --> 07:30.537
W-We don't need
to question her, Cap.

07:30.580 --> 07:32.147
We-we can handle this
and figure it out

07:32.190 --> 07:33.496
- on our own.
- Damn, Walker,

07:33.540 --> 07:34.410
you owe her money

07:34.454 --> 07:35.542
- or something?
- No.

07:35.585 --> 07:36.586
It's complicated.

07:36.630 --> 07:37.718
Okay?
I-I told her

07:37.761 --> 07:39.197
I would visit her in prison

07:39.241 --> 07:40.547
and I-I haven't really had

07:40.590 --> 07:41.809
the chance yet.
There's been a lot going on,

07:41.852 --> 07:43.506
and I'm going to.
But it-it's...

07:43.550 --> 07:45.508
Well, I guess
the lesson here is,

07:45.552 --> 07:46.988
don't be late.

08:04.832 --> 08:06.573
Twyla Jean.

08:18.149 --> 08:19.977
Should've known my little field
trip this morning would end

08:20.021 --> 08:21.892
with the two of us
in a room. Duke.

08:24.634 --> 08:26.549
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I forgot

08:26.593 --> 08:29.421
your undercover name
was Duke Culpepper.

08:29.465 --> 08:31.162
Like, what, was
Archibald Fakename

08:31.206 --> 08:32.642
already taken
by another Ranger?

08:33.730 --> 08:35.602
I like your new partner already.

08:36.864 --> 08:38.779
The Rodeo Kings
are all dead

08:38.822 --> 08:41.521
or in prison. I'm not sure
what else you think I know.

08:41.564 --> 08:43.087
This isn't about
the Rodeo Kings.

08:44.175 --> 08:45.699
This is about Eric Davies.

08:45.742 --> 08:47.875
We think Eric's

08:47.918 --> 08:49.833
involved with some
counterfeiters out of Houston.

08:50.878 --> 08:52.575
Anything you can
tell us about him?

08:52.619 --> 08:54.925
Uh, Eric just...

08:54.969 --> 08:57.101
up and left me one day
with a mountain of debt

08:57.145 --> 08:58.363
and divorce papers.

08:58.407 --> 09:01.018
Taste in men was
never my strong suit.

09:01.062 --> 09:02.846
Last time
I helped y'all,

09:02.890 --> 09:05.327
Ranger Walker promised
he'd come visit and never did.

09:05.370 --> 09:08.722
I'm gonna need something a
little more concrete this time.

09:08.765 --> 09:10.158
Well,

09:10.201 --> 09:12.290
I see that you're up
for parole next year.

09:12.334 --> 09:13.640
Can have that
pulled up.

09:13.683 --> 09:14.989
The Rangers can
vouch for you.

09:16.338 --> 09:17.600
Works for me.

09:19.428 --> 09:22.083
If Eric's in town, he'll be
at Maple Ridge Country Club.

09:22.866 --> 09:24.607
Okay.

09:24.651 --> 09:26.609
Let's check the club,
see if Eric's been seen there.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.176
Send you in,
set an exchange,

09:28.219 --> 09:29.917
try to land a face-to-face
with the counterfeiters.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.092
If that's a no-go,

09:31.135 --> 09:32.702
I guess we can,
uh, put a tracker

09:32.746 --> 09:34.574
in the crypto drive,
follow it back to the group.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.880
Uh, I hate to break it
to you, sugar,

09:36.924 --> 09:38.882
but Eric can read people.

09:38.926 --> 09:40.884
He'll see right through
Walker's charade.

09:40.928 --> 09:42.582
Charade? My charade? Hmm.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.279
Don't you
worry. Uh...

09:44.322 --> 09:46.411
we're gonna make sure to
keep Eric on his back foot.

09:47.804 --> 09:49.240
We had this play

09:49.284 --> 09:51.503
back in Dallas called
the Magician's Assistant.

09:51.547 --> 09:54.463
You send in some eye candy
as a distraction.

09:54.506 --> 09:55.812
And between

09:55.856 --> 09:58.467
Twyla's connection to Eric
and her...

09:58.510 --> 09:59.511
well,

09:59.555 --> 10:00.600
everything...

10:01.513 --> 10:02.558
...she could be

10:02.602 --> 10:04.038
- our best shot.
- Like that...

10:04.081 --> 10:06.083
episode of <i>Hawk's Shadow</i>
with the art thieves?

10:06.127 --> 10:07.432
Oh, my God, yes.

10:07.476 --> 10:09.521
I was totally lying
about Dallas.

10:09.565 --> 10:10.827
That's-that's what I was
talking about.

10:10.871 --> 10:12.089
Okay, Cap, Cap, are we sure

10:12.133 --> 10:14.004
about this?
Uh, the last time

10:14.048 --> 10:16.920
I saw Twyla on the outside,
she double-crossed me

10:16.964 --> 10:19.749
and tried to run off
with 300 grand.

10:19.793 --> 10:22.143
Well, a shot at freedom is
the best motivator.

10:23.057 --> 10:25.015
What do you say there, Twyla?

10:25.059 --> 10:26.321
You up for it?

10:26.364 --> 10:27.757
I think I can abide it,

10:27.801 --> 10:30.325
assuming Walker can let

10:30.368 --> 10:33.067
bygones be bygones.

10:33.110 --> 10:37.898
Well, uh, if Eric can
read people like you say,

10:37.941 --> 10:40.640
then I think my partner
is right.

10:40.683 --> 10:42.511
We need you.

10:43.686 --> 10:47.690
Just, uh, don't forget,
when we're together,

10:47.734 --> 10:50.345
I am going to be watching you
like a ha...

10:51.563 --> 10:52.695
Like-like what?

10:52.739 --> 10:54.044
Sorry, you trailed off
there, Walker.

10:54.088 --> 10:55.698
What were you saying?
Like a...

10:55.742 --> 10:57.091
I believe you were going
to say an animal?

10:57.134 --> 10:59.833
Maybe of the avian variety?

10:59.876 --> 11:02.313
Like a ha...
Like a, like a ha.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.707
Ho!
All right, okay.

11:04.751 --> 11:07.362
So she brings up the three of us
going on vacation,

11:07.405 --> 11:10.234
and all I can think to say
is, "Sounds like fun."

11:10.278 --> 11:11.714
Well, did you say it with
that level of enthusiasm?

11:11.758 --> 11:13.324
'Cause that wasn't good.

11:13.368 --> 11:14.891
Like, I've been tripping up
around her lately.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.806
It's like I wasn't like this
when we were married.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.721
Well, till we were
getting divorced.

11:18.765 --> 11:21.550
- I probably wasn't great then.
- It's understandable.

11:21.593 --> 11:23.204
I just, I don't know, I guess
I've never had to

11:23.247 --> 11:24.901
win her back before.

11:25.859 --> 11:26.947
You know?
Yeah.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.383
But you were pretty open
with her

11:28.426 --> 11:29.732
when you were
in the hospital, right?

11:29.776 --> 11:31.473
Yeah, of course.
But, like, over coffee

11:31.516 --> 11:34.694
I can't just talk to her about
everyday little things.

11:34.737 --> 11:36.565
It's like she means
everything to me,

11:36.608 --> 11:38.132
so I feel like
everything I say

11:38.175 --> 11:40.961
has to be, like...
I don't know.

11:41.004 --> 11:42.963
So you want to talk
girl problems, Uncle Larry?

11:44.181 --> 11:45.574
Look, Faye broke up with me

11:45.617 --> 11:47.141
when she thought Gramps
was a murderer.

11:47.184 --> 11:49.883
And he's innocent now,
and she still won't talk to me.

11:49.926 --> 11:51.145
I've literally tried
everything.

11:51.188 --> 11:54.104
I guess women are just...
unknowable.

11:54.626 --> 11:56.411
- Unknowable.
- No, no, no, no.

11:56.454 --> 11:58.587
Both of you need
to chill out, all right?

11:58.630 --> 12:01.851
Relax. Expressing feelings is
tough for a lot of people.

12:01.895 --> 12:04.462
Especially men.
And even more so when

12:04.506 --> 12:06.247
that person means a lot.

12:06.290 --> 12:08.945
I mean, we tend
to bottle things up.

12:08.989 --> 12:11.774
- Whoa, you okay?
- Ooh, oops.

12:14.646 --> 12:16.387
Are you two free
this afternoon?

12:16.431 --> 12:17.998
I think I might have an idea

12:18.041 --> 12:19.739
that's gonna help
both of you out.

12:19.782 --> 12:21.218
My dad's my boss,
so I can pretty much leave

12:21.262 --> 12:22.611
- whenever I want.
- I got a few hours till my next

12:22.654 --> 12:23.438
thing, so I can probably
squeeze it in, yeah.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.267
<i>I know you said</i>

12:26.310 --> 12:28.356
you didn't want me
to vent to you anymore,

12:28.399 --> 12:31.794
but I just felt like my head
was gonna explode.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.753
No, it's cool.

12:33.796 --> 12:36.843
I was just mad
about our other stuff.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.498
I got into Sauber.

12:40.542 --> 12:43.588
- Oh!
- But out-of-state tuition

12:43.632 --> 12:45.765
is way more than
my college fund.

12:45.808 --> 12:47.941
Financial aid, it just seems
like a lot

12:47.984 --> 12:49.681
on top of everything.

12:49.725 --> 12:52.641
No, I get it. Dad's been
pushing me towards real estate,

12:52.684 --> 12:55.165
but it just seems like
an absolute snooze fest.

12:55.209 --> 12:59.039
I genuinely forgot
your dad had a job.

12:59.082 --> 13:02.129
Oh, yeah. He's a better
Realtor than rancher.

13:02.172 --> 13:04.000
He's trying to take care
of stuff by himself.

13:04.044 --> 13:05.697
Yeah, it took him two whole days

13:05.741 --> 13:07.830
to tear down the fence
between the pastures.

13:11.486 --> 13:14.706
Hey, um, can I
ask you something?

13:14.750 --> 13:15.838
Mm-hmm.

13:17.361 --> 13:19.842
So, why are you really here?

13:19.886 --> 13:22.062
'Cause the last time
I saw you,

13:22.105 --> 13:23.759
I kind of spilled my guts
to you,

13:23.803 --> 13:26.849
and you didn't seem
like you totally hated it.

13:28.677 --> 13:29.765
I didn't.

13:30.766 --> 13:32.202
But...

13:32.246 --> 13:35.858
everything just,
it feels so unknown right now,

13:35.902 --> 13:37.381
you know, with my family.

13:37.425 --> 13:40.167
But also with me.

13:40.210 --> 13:42.822
And Todd's stable.

13:46.913 --> 13:49.959
Wait, that's hemlock.

13:50.003 --> 13:51.265
Okay.

13:51.308 --> 13:52.875
Okay, so hemlock's
really poisonous.

13:52.919 --> 13:56.009
Even a little might
kill a horse.

13:56.052 --> 13:57.619
I thought horses avoid
poisonous stuff.

13:57.662 --> 13:59.012
Not the hungry ones.

13:59.055 --> 14:01.928
Me and Gramps cut this down
every spring,

14:01.971 --> 14:04.669
and we should probably
rip these up before it spreads.

14:04.713 --> 14:07.890
I think I saw all this on
our side of the pasture,

14:07.934 --> 14:08.891
and my dad just...

14:08.935 --> 14:10.371
Took down the fence.

14:23.079 --> 14:24.776
Gotta get a move on.

14:24.820 --> 14:26.604
You ever tried to put on
a cocktail dress

14:26.648 --> 14:27.779
in the back of a van?

14:39.966 --> 14:41.228
What?

14:43.012 --> 14:44.579
There are people...Oh, shush.

14:44.622 --> 14:47.234
Shush? Okay, what are you,
what are you doing?

14:47.277 --> 14:49.279
Let me just do this real quick.

14:49.323 --> 14:51.978
Um, can you hurry?

14:52.021 --> 14:53.066
Okay...

14:53.109 --> 14:55.024
Um...

14:55.068 --> 14:57.113
Okay, was the belt
really necessary?

14:57.157 --> 14:59.550
Well, now you look less
like a narc.

14:59.594 --> 15:01.813
Thank you.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.076
Your purse, okay?

15:03.119 --> 15:04.773
All right, look.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.688
Burner phone

15:06.731 --> 15:08.472
- with your old number.
- All right.

15:08.516 --> 15:10.126
Microphone for audio.

15:10.170 --> 15:12.824
You ready?As I'll ever be.

15:12.868 --> 15:16.306
I know we're kind of throwing
you into the deep end right now.

15:16.350 --> 15:18.656
When I was under with y'all,

15:18.700 --> 15:21.572
I had a mantra I kind of
stuck to; it helped.

15:22.834 --> 15:25.881
Keep the circle small
and the lies honest.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.231
As per usual, Duke,

15:28.275 --> 15:30.538
the only one lying about
who they are today is you.

15:30.581 --> 15:33.019
Oh, damn, she got you.

15:33.062 --> 15:35.195
Now, if you two are
done yammering,

15:35.238 --> 15:37.023
can you please get the show
on the road?

15:37.066 --> 15:39.155
On our way.
All right.

15:39.199 --> 15:42.854
I am putting my
belt back on.

15:56.042 --> 15:57.913
Ooh.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.915
Seriously?
What?

15:59.959 --> 16:01.917
I've been eating prison food
for a year.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.223
Got a mark?

16:04.267 --> 16:06.356
In the dining room
by the window.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.318
That's him, right?

16:13.276 --> 16:15.017
Yeah.

16:15.061 --> 16:16.497
Okay.

16:17.498 --> 16:19.848
Yeah.

16:19.891 --> 16:21.545
Excuse me, sir.

16:22.720 --> 16:26.202
Sorry.
Uh, you're Eric, right?

16:26.246 --> 16:27.334
Name's Chris Walker.

16:27.377 --> 16:31.120
I'm Matt Ryan's boss at Drexen.

16:31.164 --> 16:32.861
You mind if we have a-a chat?
Just us?

16:32.904 --> 16:35.429
I think you're barking
up the wrong tree, dude.

16:35.472 --> 16:36.952
Don't know any Matt.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.127
Okay.

16:38.171 --> 16:39.520
Hi, Eric.

16:40.564 --> 16:42.305
Long time.

16:42.349 --> 16:44.873
Twyla.

17:12.205 --> 17:14.163
Bonham, what's going on?

17:14.207 --> 17:16.035
Stella called me.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.906
You took the fences down
between the pastures

17:17.949 --> 17:19.864
without walking the land
for hazards?

17:19.908 --> 17:22.345
My family has kept
this ranch running

17:22.389 --> 17:24.086
for over a century.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.740
You haven't been here a month,
and it's already gone to hell.

17:25.783 --> 17:27.089
Okay, how about
you get off my ranch

17:27.133 --> 17:28.308
before I have to
call the cops?

17:28.351 --> 17:30.092
Whoa, Dad, wait. Just...

17:30.136 --> 17:31.746
Tell him, Stella.

17:31.789 --> 17:34.009
Look, I know everything is
screwed up right now,

17:34.053 --> 17:36.055
but I really didn't know
who else to call.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.404
There's hemlock all over

17:37.447 --> 17:39.058
the Davidson side
of the pasture.

17:39.101 --> 17:41.669
And Colton told me that
you took down the fence,

17:41.712 --> 17:43.105
and now there's nothing
keeping the horses

17:43.149 --> 17:44.280
from grazing over there.

17:44.324 --> 17:46.239
I'm s-sorry.
I didn't even...

17:46.282 --> 17:48.197
I didn't even think
about that. Just...

17:48.241 --> 17:49.938
Well, I guess we found out
that big "D" out front

17:49.981 --> 17:51.070
stands for dumbass.

17:51.113 --> 17:52.332
Gramps, please.

17:52.375 --> 17:53.637
There are four of us.

17:53.681 --> 17:55.161
If we start now, we can

17:55.204 --> 17:57.032
pull it all up in a few hours.

17:57.076 --> 18:00.340
Can we please just stop
the family stuff until then,

18:00.383 --> 18:01.689
for the horses?

18:05.997 --> 18:07.912
Twyla Jean.

18:07.956 --> 18:12.134
Wow, what's it been,
like, three, four years?

18:12.178 --> 18:14.005
Five, actually.

18:14.049 --> 18:16.312
Well, hmm...

18:16.356 --> 18:18.619
John Boy said you got arrested
for some bank thing.

18:18.662 --> 18:21.143
Mm. Couldn't get
the charges to stick.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.885
Got a job working
for Mr. Walker.

18:23.928 --> 18:26.061
I was surprised when he
brought up your name.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.628
Yeah, so Twyla here,

18:27.671 --> 18:29.934
she handles my, uh...
my discreet accounts.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.677
Well, it's been so long,
I hope we can leave

18:33.721 --> 18:35.766
our mess in the past.

18:35.810 --> 18:38.073
You sure look like
you're doing fine now.

18:38.943 --> 18:41.337
She was right. Massive douche.

18:41.381 --> 18:43.600
- Bygones.
- Okay, you know what, Eric?

18:45.646 --> 18:47.082
I'm gonna shoot you straight.

18:47.126 --> 18:50.607
Uh, so, uh, caught Matt
skimming crypto

18:50.651 --> 18:52.261
off of some of our clients,

18:52.305 --> 18:54.307
and he let me know about
your counterfeit deal,

18:54.350 --> 18:57.571
and, uh, I want in.

18:57.614 --> 18:59.312
Hmm.

18:59.355 --> 19:01.096
Heard the group you work with

19:01.140 --> 19:02.750
is top-notch.

19:04.795 --> 19:06.536
See for yourself.

19:09.278 --> 19:12.760
Watermarks,
security ribbons.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.153
You name it,
they do it.

19:14.196 --> 19:15.676
Talented guys.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.638
Okay, how about this.

19:21.682 --> 19:23.727
I can get you 200 grand
in crypto

19:23.771 --> 19:25.686
for two million in fake cash.

19:25.729 --> 19:27.383
There's a catch.

19:27.427 --> 19:29.603
It'd be my honor
to give my compliments

19:29.646 --> 19:32.606
to the chef face-to-face.

19:34.999 --> 19:38.481
I wouldn't be much of a
middleman if I did that,

19:38.525 --> 19:39.830
but I'll see what the boys say.

19:39.874 --> 19:41.049
Okay.

19:41.092 --> 19:42.616
What coin we talking?

19:42.659 --> 19:44.095
What coin?

19:44.835 --> 19:47.795
- You tell me.
- So, he means cryptocurrency.

19:47.838 --> 19:51.146
So, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether,
- whatever he wants.
- The Bitcoin?

19:51.190 --> 19:54.541
Ethereum? Tether?
Whatever you want.

19:56.673 --> 19:59.459
Uh, you know,
after my legal troubles,

19:59.502 --> 20:00.808
no one would hire me.

20:01.809 --> 20:03.376
Walker, he took me in,

20:03.419 --> 20:04.768
gave me a job.

20:06.161 --> 20:08.076
He's good people.

20:08.119 --> 20:09.947
Hmm.

20:09.991 --> 20:12.907
Oh, so you two are a thing, huh?

20:12.950 --> 20:15.257
What? No. No.

20:15.301 --> 20:17.172
No. Never.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.261
No...He's-he's my boss. I-I wouldn't.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.523
- I wouldn't. Yeah.
- She works for me.

20:20.567 --> 20:22.221
- She... she works for me.
- Yeah.

20:22.264 --> 20:24.005
Well, if you can't be honest
with yourselves,

20:24.048 --> 20:26.529
you sure as hell ain't
gonna be honest with me.

20:26.573 --> 20:27.835
Good to see you, Twyla.

20:32.056 --> 20:33.754
What's the play, Walker?

20:33.797 --> 20:35.973
We gotta take him down.
Blow our cover.

20:36.017 --> 20:37.975
No, we'll lose
the counterfeiters.

20:38.019 --> 20:39.629
I know Eric. He won't talk.

20:39.673 --> 20:41.283
Whoa, Twyla, what are you doing?

20:41.327 --> 20:43.111
You brought me here to do a job.

20:43.154 --> 20:44.417
Let me do it.

21:02.217 --> 21:04.175
I am not...
I'm not hearing anything.

21:04.219 --> 21:06.221
I'm-I'm hearing, I'm hearing...

21:06.265 --> 21:08.702
What-what am I hearing?
I'm hearing...

21:08.745 --> 21:10.443
I'm hearing me.

21:11.487 --> 21:14.229
Damn it, Twyla.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.883
She left the mic.

21:15.926 --> 21:17.885
I'll see if I can
get eyes on them.

21:26.372 --> 21:29.984
Okay, they're talking
pretty close.

21:34.902 --> 21:36.207
Send.

21:36.251 --> 21:38.166
You get it?

21:38.209 --> 21:39.341
Yeah.

21:41.343 --> 21:42.866
This is it.

21:42.910 --> 21:44.955
This is it.
This is the double cross.

21:44.999 --> 21:46.870
They could've planned it
while she was in prison.

21:46.914 --> 21:48.568
Easy with the conspiracy
theories.

21:48.611 --> 21:49.960
Who are you, me?

21:50.004 --> 21:51.484
We don't know anything yet.

21:51.527 --> 21:52.833
See you soon.

21:55.139 --> 21:57.185
Wait, here she comes.

22:05.715 --> 22:07.413
Uh...

22:09.153 --> 22:11.634
Hey, Twyla, how'd it go?

22:11.678 --> 22:13.549
He's in.

22:13.593 --> 22:15.029
Oh...

22:15.072 --> 22:16.422
He'll text me details
of the meet later.

22:28.042 --> 22:30.610
All right.
Now, rage rooms are fairly new,

22:30.653 --> 22:32.568
but doctors have been
studying physical release

22:32.612 --> 22:34.309
pretty much since
the dawn of therapy.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.006
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

22:36.050 --> 22:38.095
This is gonna help you unlock
those deeper emotions

22:38.139 --> 22:41.403
that you've been bottling up
on a regular basis.

22:41.447 --> 22:43.797
Coach Trey, say less.

23:11.215 --> 23:13.217
Okay.

23:19.876 --> 23:21.225
Okay.

23:21.269 --> 23:24.359
Hey, hey, hey, do you even
know what that is?

23:24.403 --> 23:25.665
Yeah, it's an answering machine.

23:26.666 --> 23:28.363
His generation.

23:29.103 --> 23:31.061
Hey, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:31.105 --> 23:32.628
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

23:32.672 --> 23:33.760
Cap, try something for me.

23:33.803 --> 23:35.414
While you're swinging, just...

23:35.457 --> 23:36.893
yell about your day.

23:36.937 --> 23:38.982
I'm not much of a yeller, bro.
Yell...

23:39.026 --> 23:40.767
- Yell what about my day?
- Just trust me, all right?

23:40.810 --> 23:43.726
Anything that comes to mind.
I mean, the tiniest detail.

23:43.770 --> 23:45.685
What'd you have
- for breakfast?
- Yogurt.

23:45.728 --> 23:47.077
- Yell!
- I had yogurt for breakfast!

23:47.121 --> 23:48.775
What kind of yogurt?!

23:48.818 --> 23:50.429
I had strawberry yogurt
for breakfast at the office!

23:50.472 --> 23:52.518
Smash!
I had strawberry yogurt
for breakfast!

23:52.561 --> 23:53.823
And then what?

23:53.867 --> 23:56.130
Then I checked my emails.

23:56.173 --> 23:58.132
And then Cassie came in.

23:58.175 --> 24:00.047
I briefed her about a case.

24:00.090 --> 24:02.528
And then Walker came in.
He was late!

24:03.398 --> 24:06.183
Questioning decisions
I was making.

24:06.227 --> 24:08.229
- Yeah, how'd that make you feel?
- It was annoying.

24:08.272 --> 24:09.796
It was very, very annoying.

24:09.839 --> 24:11.450
Sometimes I feel like
our time as partners...

24:11.493 --> 24:14.844
'cause we were partners,
he doesn't respect me as a boss.

24:14.888 --> 24:17.543
He doesn't see me...Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey. Whoa.

24:18.631 --> 24:20.197
- Okay, you see?
- Okay.

24:20.241 --> 24:22.330
You see, that's what
I'm talking about.

24:22.373 --> 24:23.766
I mean, it took a little
extra testosterone

24:23.810 --> 24:25.202
to grease the wheels, but...

24:25.246 --> 24:26.247
Yeah.

24:26.290 --> 24:28.249
Sharing those tiny details

24:28.292 --> 24:30.991
leads to the deeper stuff
that you're looking for.

24:31.034 --> 24:32.601
Kelly wants to hear
all of that from you.

24:32.645 --> 24:34.516
- All right?
- Okay.

24:34.560 --> 24:38.346
Augie, I'm sorry about all the
"your dad is annoying" stuff.

24:38.389 --> 24:39.826
No, no, it's fine.

24:39.869 --> 24:41.480
I'm the captain of that ship.

24:42.655 --> 24:44.961
All right, my turn.

24:53.666 --> 24:55.450
Probably blow the rest
of the family's minds

24:55.494 --> 24:57.278
to see us out here
working together.

24:57.321 --> 24:59.498
Yeah, I'm just here
for the horses.

24:59.541 --> 25:02.022
Well, I'm sorry about
taking down that fence.

25:02.065 --> 25:04.372
I was just trying
to impress Denise.

25:06.809 --> 25:09.508
Look, uh, Colt mentioned,
uh, uh...

25:09.551 --> 25:11.118
I hope you don't mind me asking,

25:11.161 --> 25:12.946
but how-how are
your treatments going?

25:12.989 --> 25:14.774
I'm not sure I need to
get into all that with you.

25:14.817 --> 25:17.428
Yeah, that's fair.

25:17.472 --> 25:18.691
Uh...

25:19.735 --> 25:22.738
Both my folks
fought cancer.

25:22.782 --> 25:25.828
Uh, my mom made it through,
but it-it did take my dad

25:25.872 --> 25:27.830
before we had a chance
to work out our differences,

25:27.874 --> 25:31.442
so I'm glad to hear that
yours sounds like the former.

25:33.401 --> 25:36.273
It's never easy
to lose a parent.

25:36.317 --> 25:38.798
Especially to something
as wicked as that.

25:40.582 --> 25:42.149
So that's all of it.

25:42.192 --> 25:43.716
Next time,
start culling in March.

25:43.759 --> 25:45.369
- It really slows the spread.
- Right.

25:45.413 --> 25:48.155
Oh. Thank you.

25:48.198 --> 25:49.983
Uh...

25:50.026 --> 25:52.551
look, I'm clearly
in over my head.

25:52.594 --> 25:54.988
And you know this land
more than anyone,

25:55.031 --> 25:58.208
so maybe...

25:58.252 --> 26:01.864
You want me to help work
my family's ranch for you?

26:01.908 --> 26:03.779
A Davidson?

26:03.823 --> 26:05.999
- Not in a million freaking years.
- I'm sorry.

26:06.042 --> 26:08.392
I-I didn't mean
any offense by that.

26:08.436 --> 26:09.872
I'm sorry.

26:11.613 --> 26:13.267
Well, since you are an idiot,

26:13.310 --> 26:14.834
I probably should
come back out this week

26:14.877 --> 26:16.575
and spray the fields,
and I noticed there are

26:16.618 --> 26:18.794
a few fence posts
that need to be fixed, and...

26:18.838 --> 26:21.797
Chopper needs to be reshoed,
so I can call the farrier.

26:23.059 --> 26:25.845
All right.
Sounds like a plan.

26:29.022 --> 26:30.545
Do you really expect us
to believe

26:30.589 --> 26:32.373
he just changed his mind?

26:32.416 --> 26:33.940
What did you say to him?

26:33.983 --> 26:36.725
I said we should catch up
after the exchange.

26:36.769 --> 26:39.989
- Maybe get reacquainted.
- Ah.

26:40.033 --> 26:43.253
Look, I-I forgot my purse,
but I did what you asked.

26:43.297 --> 26:44.733
Did he say when
he might reach out?

26:44.777 --> 26:46.561
No, all he said was
he'd talk to his crew

26:46.605 --> 26:48.302
- and get back to me.
- Come on, Twyla.

26:48.345 --> 26:49.869
You told him something.
I know you did.

26:49.912 --> 26:51.827
You probably outed us
as Rangers, because...

26:51.871 --> 26:54.525
- Walker! Hallway. Now.
- What?

26:54.569 --> 26:56.005
- Go.
- Why?

26:57.311 --> 26:58.965
- What?
- Walk.

27:00.140 --> 27:01.837
- What?
- Get in there.

27:01.881 --> 27:03.839
Get... What? Why?
What-what are you doing?

27:03.883 --> 27:05.536
Cass, what?

27:05.580 --> 27:08.322
- Rule 33-- 43. Whatever.
- Okay, she's hiding something.

27:08.365 --> 27:09.671
You don't know her
the same way I do.

27:09.715 --> 27:11.020
She's flipped on me before.

27:11.064 --> 27:13.327
Okay, are you sure
that this isn't just

27:13.370 --> 27:15.155
entirely about Geri?

27:15.198 --> 27:18.158
Ger... What does Geri have to do
with any of this?

27:18.201 --> 27:20.813
Look, last night, you told me
you felt betrayed by Geri.

27:20.856 --> 27:22.945
And now you're saying
pretty much the exact same thing

27:22.989 --> 27:24.773
about a woman who,
may I remind you,

27:24.817 --> 27:27.123
is doing this to earn
a shot at her own freedom.

27:27.167 --> 27:30.387
Okay, okay, wait.
- I get it, but she is not Geri.
- No.

27:30.431 --> 27:33.347
I'm not saying you don't have
a right to be cautious here,

27:33.390 --> 27:34.870
but your feelings are
clouding your judgement.

27:34.914 --> 27:36.829
What is that?

27:36.872 --> 27:39.875
It's Twyla's burner phone.

27:39.919 --> 27:42.661
"5:00 p.m., dock at Shay Cove.

27:42.704 --> 27:43.966
"And one more thing,

27:44.010 --> 27:45.228
"counterfeiters
don't want crypto.

27:45.272 --> 27:46.665
"They want cash.

27:46.708 --> 27:49.929
300,000 real for
three million fake."

27:49.972 --> 27:52.932
So a last-minute change
after a mystery meeting

27:52.975 --> 27:54.673
with a known backstabber.

27:54.716 --> 27:56.544
That-that's not fishy at all.

27:57.850 --> 27:59.503
Look, do you trust me or not?

28:00.983 --> 28:02.681
And I mean that
for real this time,

28:02.724 --> 28:04.726
not in a showboaty way.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.250
Do you trust me?

28:07.294 --> 28:09.513
Of course.

28:17.826 --> 28:19.480
Whoo!

28:19.523 --> 28:20.699
Man...

28:20.742 --> 28:22.613
Hey.
Oh, watch out there.

28:23.789 --> 28:27.009
You know, if Faye
broke up with me

28:27.053 --> 28:28.750
over something I had
no control over,

28:28.794 --> 28:31.361
maybe she just
didn't like me for me

28:31.405 --> 28:33.059
in the first place.

28:33.102 --> 28:34.974
That's crazy.

28:35.017 --> 28:36.584
I gotta pee.

28:36.627 --> 28:38.586
Good luck.

28:38.629 --> 28:40.762
Oh!
Hey, thanks for that, man.

28:40.806 --> 28:42.242
That was...
that was much needed.

28:42.285 --> 28:43.896
Oh, no, man,
you don't need to thank me.

28:43.939 --> 28:46.028
I mean, dropping knowledge
is my thing.

28:46.072 --> 28:47.987
- Apparently.
- Yeah.

28:48.030 --> 28:49.597
Plus it's a good excuse
to kick it.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.381
Yeah, man.
Yeah.

28:51.425 --> 28:54.689
Hey, look, I know you got
the Sacred Heart thing going.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.778
I think there are some Rangers
that could really use

28:56.822 --> 28:59.520
your magic therapy sauce.

28:59.563 --> 29:00.956
Are you serious?

29:01.000 --> 29:02.741
Would you consider
helping out?

29:02.784 --> 29:04.264
Totally around
your schedule.

29:04.307 --> 29:06.309
You know, you can
kind of feel it out.

29:06.353 --> 29:08.268
Of course! Yeah!

29:08.311 --> 29:10.400
Yeah, man, I'd love to.

29:10.444 --> 29:12.402
All right.

29:12.446 --> 29:14.665
Well, hold on, would I...
would I get the hat?

29:14.709 --> 29:16.102
No.

29:16.145 --> 29:18.365
This face in a Stetson?
Come on.

29:20.584 --> 29:22.804
Hey, Cap?

29:22.848 --> 29:24.458
You hearing us out there?

29:25.502 --> 29:28.070
- Yeah. Loud and clear.
- Great.

29:28.114 --> 29:30.943
Cass, uh, double-check the
tracker in the bag, please.

29:30.986 --> 29:32.858
Good to go. Signal's strong.

29:37.297 --> 29:40.691
So, uh, 300 grand.

29:40.735 --> 29:42.476
Same amount as the
Rodeo Kings job.

29:42.519 --> 29:43.956
Interesting.

29:43.999 --> 29:46.175
What, exactly, is the problem?

29:46.219 --> 29:48.830
You've been riding me all day,
and it's really starting

29:48.874 --> 29:50.092
to lose its charm.

29:50.136 --> 29:51.833
Okay, well,
help me understand.

29:51.877 --> 29:54.357
Eric's out, and then you go
talk to him in private,

29:54.401 --> 29:56.446
and all of a sudden,
he's back in.

29:56.490 --> 29:58.753
Except he wants to change
the terms of the agreement

29:58.797 --> 30:01.495
to 300 grand, last minute.

30:02.583 --> 30:04.367
You know, you double-crossed
me before, Twyla.

30:04.411 --> 30:05.847
Why wouldn't you do it again?

30:05.891 --> 30:08.415
Why do you always
think the worst of me?

30:10.417 --> 30:12.375
I don't.

30:13.420 --> 30:15.161
Then how come you didn't
visit me in prison

30:15.204 --> 30:17.119
like you said you would?

30:19.600 --> 30:21.863
I was going to.
I wanted to.

30:21.907 --> 30:25.780
This last year has been
difficult on me, on my family.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.738
I needed to be
there with them.

30:27.782 --> 30:29.523
And frankly,

30:29.566 --> 30:31.351
seeing you in there
the first time

30:31.394 --> 30:35.094
was hard enough, knowing
that I put you there.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.795
Do you ever wonder
what it could've been like

30:40.839 --> 30:43.102
if we met under different
circumstances?

30:45.408 --> 30:47.367
Walker, they're here.

30:47.410 --> 30:49.108
Oh.

31:04.558 --> 31:07.343
- Howdy, y'all.
- Howdy.

31:08.344 --> 31:10.129
Who's the new girl?

31:10.172 --> 31:12.609
She is my money manager.

31:12.653 --> 31:14.916
Not really easy to, uh,
come up with an extra

31:14.960 --> 31:16.135
hundred K on short notice,

31:16.178 --> 31:19.268
but this one here is the best.

31:19.312 --> 31:20.400
Name's Archibald.

31:23.707 --> 31:25.318
- Did you bring the money?
- Sure did.

31:27.059 --> 31:28.887
Not you.

31:28.930 --> 31:30.584
Twyla.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.341
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:48.384 --> 31:49.733
Walker, what's going on?

31:49.777 --> 31:51.213
Everybody calm down, all right?

31:51.257 --> 31:53.041
Eric, what is this?

31:53.085 --> 31:54.477
Do I need to explain
what bending you

31:54.521 --> 31:55.914
over a barrel looks like?

31:55.957 --> 31:57.698
Guns, please.

31:57.741 --> 31:58.829
Yep, yep.

31:58.873 --> 32:00.353
Okay.

32:02.572 --> 32:04.792
Let's all just...

32:04.835 --> 32:07.273
Let's all take a breath here.

32:07.316 --> 32:09.928
Keep the money.
Keep the money.

32:09.971 --> 32:12.931
No harm, no foul.
Just let Twyla go.

32:12.974 --> 32:14.019
Twyla?

32:15.455 --> 32:18.414
- Yeah.
- She can speak for herself.

32:18.458 --> 32:20.677
Told you he'd fall for it.

32:22.679 --> 32:23.985
Aw, come on.

32:24.029 --> 32:25.378
I couldn't pass up
the opportunity

32:25.421 --> 32:27.380
to steal 300 grand
from you, Walker.

32:27.423 --> 32:30.731
Me and Eric are gonna stop by
his counterfeiting buddies,

32:30.774 --> 32:33.255
pick up some more cash
and ride off into the sunset.

32:33.299 --> 32:35.170
Oh, honey,

32:35.214 --> 32:36.867
I don't have any buddies.

32:36.911 --> 32:38.782
I'm the counterfeiter.

32:38.826 --> 32:40.480
Hey, Eric, check this out.

32:42.482 --> 32:43.831
Ooh, boy.

32:45.572 --> 32:47.922
I might have underestimated you
a bit, Mr. Walker.

32:49.054 --> 32:50.925
We're heading in,
90 seconds out.

32:50.969 --> 32:53.275
Uh, so you found, uh,
the tracking device.

32:53.319 --> 32:58.019
Just a... a little
insurance policy, that's all.

32:58.063 --> 33:00.152
- I think we're done here.
- Okay.

33:00.195 --> 33:01.892
Pleasure doing business.

33:01.936 --> 33:04.373
Now, if you just hit the deck
and count to 50...

33:04.417 --> 33:05.679
50. Uh...

33:07.028 --> 33:08.899
That sounds familiar.
You got it.

33:08.943 --> 33:10.379
No, wait.

33:11.293 --> 33:13.121
Give me the gun.

33:13.165 --> 33:14.601
Twyla. Twyla.

33:14.644 --> 33:16.037
60 seconds.

33:16.081 --> 33:18.518
Put the gun down.
Twyla, don't do this.

33:18.561 --> 33:21.260
You should've visited me
in prison.

33:22.957 --> 33:26.047
And you shouldn't have left me
in debt five years ago!

33:59.124 --> 34:01.648
Eric, drop the gun.

34:01.691 --> 34:03.128
Texas Rangers.

34:05.304 --> 34:07.262
You, don't move.

34:07.306 --> 34:09.177
You good?

34:09.221 --> 34:11.092
Yeah.

34:11.136 --> 34:13.138
I was wrong about the belt.

34:13.181 --> 34:15.009
I was... I was wrong, too.

34:18.186 --> 34:19.622
Shall we?

34:19.666 --> 34:21.102
Sh... What?

34:21.146 --> 34:22.321
No, don't, don't...

34:22.364 --> 34:24.018
- Ca-caw!
- No, no, no, no, no.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.193
- I-I'm not doing that.
- Walker, come on.
Do it just once.

34:37.292 --> 34:39.338
Hey.
Hey.

34:39.381 --> 34:41.079
Is everything all right?
Your text sounded urgent.

34:41.122 --> 34:42.428
Oh, oh, uh...

34:42.471 --> 34:44.430
It is, and it isn't.
It's just...

34:44.473 --> 34:46.084
Bear with me here.
Have a seat.

34:46.127 --> 34:47.650
I'm trying to be a gentleman.

34:47.694 --> 34:49.652
Okay.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.224
Hi.
Hi.

34:57.443 --> 34:59.619
I was at the grocery store
this morning.

34:59.662 --> 35:01.229
Okay.

35:02.926 --> 35:05.233
I was walking down
the cereal aisle, and there was

35:05.277 --> 35:08.018
a tub of sour cream,
just sitting there, right?

35:08.062 --> 35:09.759
Like somebody had called
an audible.

35:09.803 --> 35:11.283
- Mm-hmm.
- Instead of taking it back

35:11.326 --> 35:13.154
to the dairy section,
where it belonged,

35:13.198 --> 35:14.590
they just left it there.

35:14.634 --> 35:17.027
To most people,
this would not be a big deal.

35:17.071 --> 35:21.162
I was enraged.

35:21.206 --> 35:22.903
This is why I never sent you
to the grocery store.

35:22.946 --> 35:25.123
You joke, but...

35:27.125 --> 35:29.127
This is what I'm trying to say.

35:29.170 --> 35:31.651
Law enforcement...

35:31.694 --> 35:33.653
isn't just a job for me.

35:33.696 --> 35:35.220
It's who I am, Kelly.

35:35.263 --> 35:37.918
Larry, I know... you know...
you know I know this.

35:37.961 --> 35:39.572
It is part...

35:39.615 --> 35:41.269
It's part of the problem.
I know. Just hear me out.

35:41.313 --> 35:42.705
Hear me out, okay?

35:42.749 --> 35:45.708
Before we split up,
I was trying to keep work

35:45.752 --> 35:48.537
separate from home. Right?

35:48.581 --> 35:52.280
But by doing that, I was
keeping me separate from you.

35:52.324 --> 35:53.629
And like you said,

35:53.673 --> 35:56.154
I don't want to
repeat mistakes. I don't.

35:56.197 --> 35:59.722
So yesterday, when you
brought up vacation,

35:59.766 --> 36:02.029
I shouldn't have said,
"Sounds like fun."

36:03.770 --> 36:08.557
I mean, you, me,
DJ on a beach, that's like...

36:08.601 --> 36:12.431
What I should have told you is
that just the thought of that

36:12.474 --> 36:17.653
made me feel whole again.

36:17.697 --> 36:20.308
You know?

36:20.352 --> 36:23.093
So...

36:23.137 --> 36:25.444
what do you say?

36:25.487 --> 36:27.533
You still in?

36:32.277 --> 36:33.930
Sounds like fun.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.196
Yes.

36:41.547 --> 36:43.288
Mawline says
lunch is ready.

36:43.331 --> 36:45.203
Okay.

36:48.118 --> 36:51.034
Looks like you got an email
from Sauber.

36:52.297 --> 36:55.213
Oh, it's probably
just spam or something.

36:56.257 --> 36:58.216
You got in, didn't you?

36:59.260 --> 37:00.696
Yeah.

37:00.740 --> 37:02.742
But I haven't told anyone

37:02.785 --> 37:05.005
'cause I don't even know
if I want to go yet.

37:05.048 --> 37:07.616
And there's so much stuff
going on,

37:07.660 --> 37:10.271
it doesn't seem like
great timing.
Hey.

37:10.315 --> 37:12.969
You don't need to hide
your wins.

37:13.013 --> 37:14.232
Your daddy would want to know

37:14.275 --> 37:16.103
regardless of what
you decide to do.

37:16.146 --> 37:19.280
You know, I've felt
a little adrift recently,

37:19.324 --> 37:22.283
but sometimes you gotta
just latch onto something

37:22.327 --> 37:24.024
and get excited about it.

37:24.067 --> 37:26.548
Like working the ranch again.

37:29.116 --> 37:32.293
Well, that situation has been
a little hard to swallow,

37:32.337 --> 37:34.295
but the truth is,

37:34.339 --> 37:35.862
out there working
my family's land

37:35.905 --> 37:38.038
just might be the best way to...

37:38.081 --> 37:39.779
to honor their legacy,

37:39.822 --> 37:42.042
whether we live there or not.

37:42.085 --> 37:44.174
So you tell your daddy.

37:44.218 --> 37:45.567
Okay?

37:45.611 --> 37:47.613
You spread the joy and whatnot.

37:47.656 --> 37:49.745
We need a little bit
right now.

37:49.789 --> 37:51.269
Okay.

37:51.312 --> 37:52.835
Okay. Hey, by the way,

37:52.879 --> 37:54.620
how'd you end up
out at the ranch yesterday?

37:54.663 --> 37:57.492
I thought you were gonna
go hang out with Todd.

37:57.536 --> 38:00.887
I don't know, just
changed my mind, I guess.

38:06.719 --> 38:09.374
Well,

38:09.417 --> 38:11.811
you might want to be
careful of that one.

38:20.210 --> 38:21.995
Thank you for speaking
for me in there.

38:22.038 --> 38:23.562
Felt good to have
someone in my corner.

38:23.605 --> 38:25.477
I meant every word.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.087
You earned your parole.

38:27.130 --> 38:30.090
I'm just glad I could
be a part of it.

38:30.133 --> 38:32.962
Oh. I brought you these.

38:33.006 --> 38:35.095
Some éclairs from the club.

38:37.489 --> 38:40.361
Look, I don't mean
to sound ungrateful,

38:40.405 --> 38:44.234
but why are you being
so sweet to me?

38:44.278 --> 38:47.629
When I came to Austin,
I had been

38:47.673 --> 38:49.805
out of the Ranger game
for a minute.

38:50.893 --> 38:53.853
Walker gave me a shot
at a fresh start.

38:54.810 --> 38:56.595
Felt like you deserved one, too.

38:59.772 --> 39:02.775
You know, he can be
a big old dummy sometimes...

39:04.820 --> 39:06.213
...but he means well.

39:08.128 --> 39:09.608
Thank you.

39:15.570 --> 39:16.876
Well, well, well.

39:16.919 --> 39:19.574
If it isn't, uh,
liar liar pants on fire.

39:23.709 --> 39:26.494
You know you're the reason
I had to lie, right?

39:28.409 --> 39:30.977
When Eric made his play,
I knew the only way

39:31.020 --> 39:33.066
to catch the counterfeiters
was to go with him.

39:33.109 --> 39:35.068
Have you follow us
back to their shop.

39:36.330 --> 39:38.201
But if I tell you that,
you bench me,

39:38.245 --> 39:41.117
thinking I'm gonna
run off for real.

39:41.161 --> 39:43.511
And if he doesn't see me
on that dock,

39:43.555 --> 39:46.558
he just drives right on by.

39:46.601 --> 39:50.518
No counterfeiters, no parole.

39:50.562 --> 39:52.259
No parole.

39:52.302 --> 39:54.043
What I didn't realize was...

39:54.087 --> 39:57.569
Was that Eric was
the counterfeiter.

39:57.612 --> 39:59.440
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:59.484 --> 40:03.270
When they found the tracker,
I knew I had to do something.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.273
I can't tell you
how good it felt

40:06.316 --> 40:07.883
smashing him in the face.

40:11.670 --> 40:13.976
Twyla, I'm sorry.

40:14.020 --> 40:15.587
I should have trusted you more.

40:15.630 --> 40:17.806
I've been going
through something

40:17.850 --> 40:20.069
that's left me
a little raw,

40:20.113 --> 40:21.984
and insecurities
got the best of me,

40:22.028 --> 40:23.682
and, uh, I'm-I'm sorry.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.729
It really feels like I've been
saying "bygones" an awful lot,

40:27.773 --> 40:31.864
so I'm just gonna say
I forgive you.

40:36.390 --> 40:39.785
I never answered your
question on the dock,

40:39.828 --> 40:42.265
when you asked what I
thought it might be like

40:42.309 --> 40:44.485
if we had met under
different circumstances.

40:44.529 --> 40:47.575
And it got me thinking--
I guess I...

40:47.619 --> 40:51.057
finally realized that
ever since the day we met,

40:51.100 --> 40:55.975
there's been either lies
or a badge between us.

40:56.018 --> 40:57.977
And I'm not trying to say that
it should have been diff...

40:58.020 --> 41:00.370
I'm not gonna tell you
that it's like...Relax, sugar.

41:00.414 --> 41:03.112
You've got "hot mess"
written all over you.

41:03.156 --> 41:05.767
Okay. Okay.

41:05.811 --> 41:07.639
My point is, um...

41:09.075 --> 41:10.468
Come here.

41:12.644 --> 41:14.515
Hi.

41:16.952 --> 41:18.127
Cordell.

41:19.955 --> 41:21.479
Twyla.

41:21.522 --> 41:23.524
Twyla Jean.
