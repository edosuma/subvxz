"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.167 --> 00:36.233
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.267 --> 00:38.800
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:38.833 --> 00:40.833
in a court of law.

00:42.033 --> 00:43.667
-Deputy:
Growing up, my grandfather had

00:43.700 --> 00:45.733
a shop in the heart of where
I patrol every day.

00:45.767 --> 00:48.133
And when I pass it,
I smile and I look at it,

00:48.167 --> 00:50.300
and think of the things
he taught me.

00:50.333 --> 00:52.100
The best thing, hands down,

00:52.133 --> 00:54.133
is how to catch scallops
with my bare feet.

00:54.167 --> 00:56.400
Those are the memories
that I like to keep with me.

00:56.433 --> 00:58.333
So every time I pass it,
I think of him

00:58.367 --> 01:01.267
and... you know,
the good things in life.

01:02.767 --> 01:05.200
All right, we're gonna
pull this car over
for a seatbelt violation.

01:05.233 --> 01:08.700
And it looks like
the driver's trying to throw
something in the backseat.

01:08.733 --> 01:10.700
Appears he's fixin'
to be pullin' into
this tire store here.

01:10.733 --> 01:12.800
I make the stop here.

01:12.833 --> 01:13.867
-(radio beep)

01:13.900 --> 01:15.133
-Black Mustang

01:15.167 --> 01:16.733
Stay in the car!
Stay in the car!

01:16.767 --> 01:17.900
-What you want, man?

01:17.933 --> 01:19.733
God damn, man, what you want?

01:19.767 --> 01:21.500
-(shouting)

01:22.767 --> 01:24.233
-Get the car!

01:24.267 --> 01:26.233
Scan me! 10-13 traffic,

01:26.267 --> 01:27.967
send me some units.

01:28.067 --> 01:29.933
-Man, what do you want, man?

01:29.967 --> 01:31.333
-(radio chatter)

01:31.367 --> 01:32.533
-Man: Hey, man.
-Hey, help!

01:32.567 --> 01:34.100
Stay on the ground!

01:34.133 --> 01:35.667
Stay on the ground!

01:38.467 --> 01:39.800
-Man:
Stop moving, man!

01:39.833 --> 01:42.300
He's smack-jammed between!
He's jammed between the cars!

01:47.733 --> 01:50.067
-I'm getting my money, man.

01:50.067 --> 01:51.833
-Put your hands
behind your back!

01:55.933 --> 01:59.233
-Dispatch:

02:00.300 --> 02:02.067

02:03.067 --> 02:04.767
-He bailed out,
it pinned them in.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.067
-We're pinned in.

02:06.067 --> 02:07.933
-The cars-- Back--
Put the car in reverse.

02:11.933 --> 02:13.200
-Step out of the car.

02:13.233 --> 02:14.400
-Get him out!
He bailed...

02:14.433 --> 02:15.633
-Get him out!
-and pinned them in.

02:15.667 --> 02:16.867
-Get him out.

02:17.933 --> 02:19.233
Get him out.

02:19.267 --> 02:22.667

02:22.700 --> 02:24.133
-(chattering)

02:24.167 --> 02:25.767
-Telling y'all,
(bleep) with me, man.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.267
Goddamn!

02:27.300 --> 02:29.533
Can't even get
a mother- (bleep) Tylenol!

02:29.567 --> 02:31.700
-Hey, ready?
One, two, get up.

02:33.233 --> 02:36.133
-308, EMS, FHP.

02:36.167 --> 02:37.533
-Goddamn, man!

02:37.567 --> 02:39.533
-Went hands-on and took him
to the ground.

02:39.567 --> 02:41.333
Car was still in drive

02:41.367 --> 02:43.900
and it pinned two individuals
in the car.

02:43.933 --> 02:45.567
He has not been searched.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.200
-(indistinct)

02:47.233 --> 02:49.133
Goddamn, man!
-Hey, are y'all okay?

02:49.167 --> 02:50.367
-Yes, sir, we're good.

02:50.400 --> 02:51.933
-(chatter)

02:51.967 --> 02:54.400
-Pull your leg up.
Pull your pants up.

02:54.433 --> 02:56.133
-We good.
We good, brother.

02:56.167 --> 02:57.800
-Oh, that's a skinny leg.

02:57.833 --> 03:00.400
-(laughter)

03:00.433 --> 03:01.967
-It a little tight, man.

03:02.067 --> 03:03.233
-What's all this about, John?

03:03.267 --> 03:04.833
-Nothing, man.

03:04.867 --> 03:06.200

03:06.233 --> 03:08.133
-But-- Listen to me.
-A tire?

03:08.167 --> 03:11.600
-You got out, I told you
to stay in the car.

03:11.633 --> 03:14.167
You had the-- "Okay, I'm not
gonna hang around."
-No, no, no, no, no.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.267
-I ain't gon-- No.
(indistinct arguing)
-Do you have a license?

03:16.300 --> 03:17.733
-No, that's why I got out.

03:17.767 --> 03:19.333
-Come on.
-But I ain't finna
run from you, bro.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.433
-I don't know what your
intentions are.
-I got to tell you, man,

03:21.467 --> 03:22.733
(indistinct)

03:22.767 --> 03:24.667
-Okay, but I don't know
what your intentions are.

03:24.700 --> 03:25.900
-Yeah, man. Yeah.
-Fair enough?

03:25.933 --> 03:27.433
-Do you know what mine are?

03:27.467 --> 03:28.500
-No.

03:28.533 --> 03:30.267
-Do I know what yours are?
-No, sir.

03:30.300 --> 03:33.167
-So when you jump out, okay...

03:34.167 --> 03:35.967
hear me out, when you jump out,
-Yeah.

03:36.067 --> 03:37.633
-and you kinda want to start
getting gone--

03:37.667 --> 03:39.867
-(mumbling)

03:39.900 --> 03:41.367
I know I'm going
to the tire shop.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.800
-Okay listen--
Okay, listen to me.

03:42.833 --> 03:44.967
I don't know
what your plans are.

03:45.067 --> 03:46.767
I don't know
if you got a gun.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.267
-(bleep) no.

03:48.300 --> 03:49.700
-But do I know that?

03:49.733 --> 03:52.900
When you want to take off,
I'm gonna take you
into custody.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.367
Okay?

03:54.400 --> 03:56.100
Fair enough?
-Yes, sir.

03:56.133 --> 03:57.767
-So, the only thing is
no license, brother?

03:57.800 --> 03:59.100
-That's it.

03:59.133 --> 04:00.633
No license, man.

04:00.667 --> 04:01.967
-Come on, man.
-That's my problem, man.

04:02.067 --> 04:03.700
No license. No nothing.
That's all it is.
No license.

04:03.733 --> 04:04.833
-Whose money is that?

04:04.867 --> 04:06.400
-Mine. My wife's money.

04:06.433 --> 04:09.700
She gave it to me
to come up here
and pay a bill.

04:09.733 --> 04:11.733
Then I come up here
for the tire, you know
what I'm saying?

04:11.767 --> 04:14.200
Then, at the same time
me and wife got into it
this morning.

04:14.233 --> 04:16.067
So I took it.
So I ran off.

04:16.067 --> 04:17.667
-And you was
already frustrated?

04:17.700 --> 04:19.067
Hey.
-Radio: Car 48.

04:19.100 --> 04:20.433
-Now she's gonna be mad.

04:20.467 --> 04:22.067
-Look, are you being
straight up with me?

04:22.067 --> 04:23.600
-(mumbles)
-Anything in the car?

04:23.633 --> 04:25.100
Anything illegal?
-Hey, no, no, no.

04:25.133 --> 04:27.267
-Okay. All right.
-No, no, no. No, no, no.

04:27.300 --> 04:28.300
-(radio chatter)

04:28.333 --> 04:30.300
-Anything in the car?

04:30.333 --> 04:33.067
-Looks like they ripped the weed
and just threw it in the back.

04:33.100 --> 04:34.167
-Really?

04:34.200 --> 04:35.667
-Yeah, not even a nickel bag.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.533
I mean, it's all over.
You can see it.

04:38.567 --> 04:40.967
It's all over back here.
It's all over the front seat.

04:41.067 --> 04:44.300
-Oh, yeah. Looks like he
just tore the bag open
with the marijuana inside

04:44.333 --> 04:46.100
and I guess,
for whatever reason,
left it.

04:46.133 --> 04:49.133
I'm gonna go over here
and talk to the other guy,
figure out what we got goin' on.

04:50.367 --> 04:51.633
Ulysses, what's up?

04:51.667 --> 04:53.367
-How you doin'?
-How you been?

04:53.400 --> 04:54.933
I ain't seen you
in a minute.

04:54.967 --> 04:56.700
What the heck's goin' on?

04:56.733 --> 04:58.400
What's goin' on
with all this?

04:58.433 --> 04:59.467
-(mumbles)

04:59.500 --> 05:01.667
-I know, fair enough.
And I appreciate--

05:01.700 --> 05:02.933
-I sat right in the seat.

05:02.967 --> 05:04.767
-Huh?
-I didn't move, I sat
right in the seat.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.300
-Hey, and I appreciate that.

05:06.333 --> 05:08.967
-Obviously, you ain't
done nothing wrong,
so you just hung out.

05:09.067 --> 05:10.967
-You saw me.
-Okay. How you been?

05:11.067 --> 05:12.633
-Been aight since I been out.

05:12.667 --> 05:14.867
-How long ago did you get in
the car with him, bro?

05:14.900 --> 05:16.500
-20 minutes ago.
We just came from the school.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.933
You can go down to the school.
We just left the school
down the street.

05:18.967 --> 05:21.200
-Okay. Obviously,
the marijuana's all on his seat.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.567
The bag's on his seat.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.933
Wasn't your dope? No?

05:24.967 --> 05:26.167
Okay.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.100
Did you see him
tear the bag open
or anything?

05:28.133 --> 05:29.467
-No.
-No?

05:29.500 --> 05:31.333
All right. Sit tight
and we'll get right with you.

05:31.367 --> 05:32.633
All right?

05:33.633 --> 05:35.633
-(indistinct chatter)

05:36.667 --> 05:37.833
-Make sure...

05:37.867 --> 05:39.333
-Yeah, he said--
-What hit you here?

05:39.367 --> 05:40.633
-That's an existing injury.

05:40.667 --> 05:42.200
-He said that's
a previous injury.
-Okay. All right.

05:42.233 --> 05:43.933
-Yeah.
-Just wanted to make sure.

05:43.967 --> 05:45.667
-Yeah, it looks like the scab
of it right there.

05:45.700 --> 05:47.100
Or is that weed?
That's a scab.

05:47.133 --> 05:49.067
Okay.
-Yeah, he said it was
a previous injury.

05:49.100 --> 05:50.500
-Okay.
-Okay.

05:50.533 --> 05:51.900
-Turn around
and look at me.

05:51.933 --> 05:54.767
-Um... They're gonna go ahead
and take him to the hospital.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.200
Get his injuries checked out,

05:56.233 --> 05:59.467
make sure there's nothing more
that we can't see here on scene.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.500
He got
the misdemeanor marijuana,

06:01.533 --> 06:02.933
he admitted he didn't
have a license

06:02.967 --> 06:04.633
and it's gonna be
third assessment, so...

06:04.667 --> 06:06.433
gonna be Felony DWS.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.900
Hi, I'm Deputy Rogers,
Sheriff's Office.

06:08.933 --> 06:10.167
Um, you all right?

06:10.200 --> 06:11.233
-Yes, sir.
Yeah, we good.

06:11.267 --> 06:12.333
-Okay.
-They're giving us a ride.

06:12.367 --> 06:13.767
-That your son
that was with you?
-Yeah.

06:13.800 --> 06:14.867
-He's good too?
-Yeah, he's good.

06:14.900 --> 06:17.233
-I appreciate y'all...
not freaking out--

06:17.267 --> 06:19.067
-I'm like, trying to help you,
but I wasn't gonna

06:19.100 --> 06:20.467
get in the car
while you doing your job.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.300
-Yeah, and I understand that.

06:22.333 --> 06:25.067
-And I didn't know what
he had on the other side of him,
if he had a gun or anything.

06:25.067 --> 06:27.133
-Yeah, and I clearly-- You know,
I was worried about y'all.

06:27.167 --> 06:29.067
I didn't know how bad
it was pinned.

06:29.067 --> 06:30.667
I could see the car
wasn't moving very fast, but--

06:30.700 --> 06:33.133
-Yeah, it was in neutral.
I just yelling to let you know
it was in neutral.

06:33.167 --> 06:35.233
-Yeah, and I was just worried
it had y'all pinned in. So...

06:35.267 --> 06:37.667
-If the motor revved on me,
I'd have been, yeah, I'd have
been in panic.

06:37.700 --> 06:39.400
-Yeah, and clearly,
I wasn't letting him up.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.667
-Well, you had to. Hell no!
I wouldn't have
let him up either.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.100
-'Cause I didn't know
his intentions.

06:43.133 --> 06:44.967
You know, he didn't want
to give his hands up.
None of that.

06:45.067 --> 06:46.133
So, off to jail
he goes.

06:48.633 --> 06:50.333
-Deputy:
Hillsborough County
is pretty unique.

06:50.367 --> 06:52.700
Our sheriff, our agency,
we've done a good job

06:52.733 --> 06:55.867
of keeping a solid rapport
with the community.

06:55.900 --> 06:59.067
Recently we lost an officer
and I would be parked at
a gas station

06:59.067 --> 07:02.567
and somebody would just come up
and say, "Hey, we just want to
tell you we are sorry.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.167
And we thank you
for what you do."

07:04.200 --> 07:06.333
I mean, we take care
of the people who live here

07:06.367 --> 07:08.767
and they're very receptive
of that.

07:10.433 --> 07:12.667
We're heading to
a domestic violence

07:12.700 --> 07:15.567
in a apartment complex

07:15.600 --> 07:17.767
between a male and a female.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.067
That's all we have.

07:19.067 --> 07:20.467
-Dispatch:
Callback. 3 up, go 17.

07:20.500 --> 07:21.867
-Officer over radio:
Copy.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.367
-What's going on?

07:23.400 --> 07:26.733
-It's me you want, sir,
you can put me in jail
if you want to.

07:26.767 --> 07:28.200
-Why do I need
to put you in jail?

07:28.233 --> 07:29.900
-Because it's always me.

07:29.933 --> 07:32.200
-Look, just tell me
what happened today.

07:32.233 --> 07:34.100
-I just want my (bleep).

07:34.133 --> 07:35.600
I just want my money.

07:35.633 --> 07:38.700
I want my teeth,
I want my bonus check,
and I'll leave.

07:38.733 --> 07:40.267
-Did somebody
take something from you?

07:40.300 --> 07:41.700
-Yeah, everybody did!

07:41.733 --> 07:44.233
They did, they got my money.

07:44.267 --> 07:48.267
And this guy over here
gots my phone, gots my teeth,
and everything.

07:48.300 --> 07:50.233
-Yeah.
-I work my ass off

07:50.267 --> 07:52.233
every mother- (bleep) day!

07:52.267 --> 07:56.233
Making them little two little
pussy-ass mother- (bleep)

07:56.267 --> 07:59.567
thousands and thousands
and thousands of dollars
a day,

07:59.600 --> 08:01.600
and I don't see (bleep)

08:01.633 --> 08:03.067
and I get in trouble.

08:03.067 --> 08:05.433
And I busted my dad
right dead in the face.

08:05.467 --> 08:08.167
I took my teeth out
and I busted him right dead
in the face with them.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.500
-Who'd you hit?

08:09.533 --> 08:11.433
-I hit my dad
right dead in the face.

08:11.467 --> 08:13.567
Put me in jail
for domestic violence.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.433
-Okay.
-I'm done with it, man.

08:15.467 --> 08:16.767
-So, why'd you hit your dad?

08:16.800 --> 08:18.833
-Because he's
a pussy-ass bitch, man.

08:18.867 --> 08:21.767
I ain't working my ass off
every mother- (bleep) day

08:21.800 --> 08:24.933
cutting my hands with
a (bleep) chainsaw for free.

08:24.967 --> 08:27.267
-Okay. So y'all were in
a verbal argument...

08:27.300 --> 08:28.900
-And I did it.
-you took your teeth out,
and you--

08:28.933 --> 08:30.433
-Yeah, I hit him right--
-Did he hit you?

08:30.467 --> 08:31.967
-No, sir.
-All right.

08:32.067 --> 08:34.500
I tell you what, we're just
gonna walk over to this car,

08:34.533 --> 08:36.067
I'm gonna detain you
for a little while.

08:36.067 --> 08:37.633
-I don't want to sit
in nobody's car.

08:37.667 --> 08:39.567
Can I please smoke
a cigarette outside the car?

08:39.600 --> 08:41.633
-Well, you asked me
to arrest you.

08:41.667 --> 08:44.067
-What--
-I really don't
want to be arrested.

08:44.067 --> 08:45.133
-Okay, all right.

08:45.167 --> 08:46.533
-I really don't.
-Well, let me do this.

08:46.567 --> 08:48.600
-Let me--
-Just bring me my stuff
and I'll leave.

08:48.633 --> 08:50.367
-Just listen to me.
I'm gonna go ahead
and detain you.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.067
We're gonna figure all this out.
All right?

08:52.100 --> 08:55.467
-I'll go to jail.
It ain't my first time
and it won't be my last time.

08:55.500 --> 08:56.967
-Well, I hope it's the last.

08:57.067 --> 08:58.567
Why would you want
to keep doing that?

08:58.600 --> 09:00.400
-I don't give a (bleep)
about nothing, man.
-Hey.

09:00.433 --> 09:01.600
Why would you--
-I don't.

09:01.633 --> 09:03.267
-I know you don't,
but you need to.

09:03.300 --> 09:04.367
Let's go.
-Yes.

09:04.400 --> 09:06.700
How's it feel,
you pussy-ass bitch?

09:06.733 --> 09:07.867
-Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

09:07.900 --> 09:09.700
-I'll go to jail
and not be nice.

09:09.733 --> 09:11.400
-Be nice just for me, all right?

09:11.433 --> 09:12.700
-Okay, I will.

09:12.733 --> 09:14.467
-All right, thank you.
-Please don't take me to jail.

09:14.500 --> 09:15.733
-Um, I'm gonna do what I can do.

09:15.767 --> 09:17.900
We're-- You and I--
Listen, turn around, face me.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.667
Sit down like that.
There you go.

09:19.700 --> 09:21.067
And slide across.
There you go.

09:21.100 --> 09:22.100
-(radio chatter)

09:23.533 --> 09:26.733
-Woman #1:
She's telling them
she wants to go to jail.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.667
-Hey, you mind taking
your hat off for me
there real quick?

09:28.700 --> 09:30.333
Let me take a look
at what you got going on here.

09:30.367 --> 09:31.600
-Yes, sir.

09:31.633 --> 09:34.167
-Right there.
-I see it, ma'am.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.267
-I don't want to press charges
against her hitting--
doing that.

09:36.300 --> 09:38.267
-Right, right. Right.
-That's my daughter.

09:38.300 --> 09:39.933
-Can you kind of spread
the skin a little bit?

09:39.967 --> 09:41.233
Let me see
what's going on.

09:41.267 --> 09:42.700
-I don't know what you're--
I can't see.

09:42.733 --> 09:44.067
-Okay, that ain't too bad.

09:44.100 --> 09:46.733
-Woman #1:
Her ex-boyfriend
is going to prison for 15 years

09:46.767 --> 09:48.733
and that's what
she's upset about.

09:48.767 --> 09:51.333
-I don't think she actually
meant to hit me
in the (bleep) face.

09:51.367 --> 09:53.133
-Well, she said
she punched you in the face.

09:53.167 --> 09:56.167
-No, she threw her dentures.

09:56.200 --> 09:58.167
-Woman #1:
It was a home invasion...

09:58.200 --> 09:59.367
-They were dentures.
-and all that.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.900
She took those out
and she threw them at you?

10:00.933 --> 10:03.267
-And slung 'em.
I don't think she slung 'em,

10:03.300 --> 10:05.267
man, she just slung 'em and it
happened to hit me here.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.700
-Oh, okay.

10:06.733 --> 10:09.300
-So, that's a misunderstanding.
She did not do that
to me.

10:09.333 --> 10:11.233
-All righty.
All righty.

10:11.267 --> 10:14.667
-So, don't put her in jail
for that because she didn't
do it.

10:14.700 --> 10:16.167
-Woman #1:
No, she's going to jail.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.400
-Okay.
-If she's going to jail,
she's going to jail. I mean--

10:18.433 --> 10:21.233
-Woman #1: She's going to jail.
-All right. Okay. All right.
Well, give me one second.

10:21.267 --> 10:24.600
Excuse me, uh...
does somebody have her teeth?

10:25.667 --> 10:27.767
-(chatter)
-(laughter)

10:29.033 --> 10:30.900
Does somebody have
this woman's teeth?

10:30.933 --> 10:32.667
-(clapping)
-Oh, boy, that was a good one.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.000
-No? All right, just checking.

10:35.033 --> 10:37.133
-Woman #2: I do right here.
-Oh, you got her teeth.
All right.

10:37.167 --> 10:40.300
Um, I'm not gonna take them
with this bare hand here.

10:40.333 --> 10:42.833
How'd you end up
with Mary's teeth?

10:42.867 --> 10:45.100
-Paul gave them to me.
-Paul gave them to you?

10:45.133 --> 10:48.067
-He kept them and he said
he wasn't giving them to her
until the police came.

10:48.100 --> 10:50.067
-Why would he have her teeth?

10:50.100 --> 10:52.500
-I have no idea.
She took them out.

10:52.533 --> 10:54.200
-You don't know why her teeth
are out of her head?

10:54.233 --> 10:55.433
-I have no idea.

10:55.467 --> 10:58.033
-Kay. Thank you.

10:58.067 --> 11:00.267
I found the weapon.

11:01.267 --> 11:03.300
Do you want to impound these?

11:04.667 --> 11:07.400
She-- Her story is that she took
her teeth out and punched him.

11:07.433 --> 11:10.567
But he's verifying
that she didn't punch him.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.500
So, I mean, I don't know
that we necessarily
have anybody.

11:12.533 --> 11:14.400
So, she's not a victim.
-Right.

11:14.433 --> 11:16.433
-And he doesn't want
to be a victim.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.467
-Right.
-Woman #1:
Please don't take her to jail.

11:18.500 --> 11:19.800
Don't take her to jail.

11:19.833 --> 11:22.867
Okay, well a second ago,
you asked me to take her
to jail.

11:22.900 --> 11:24.267
-I don't want her to go to jail.

11:24.300 --> 11:26.067
-But you wanted her to go
to jail a second ago.

11:26.067 --> 11:28.333
The only thing
that we're investigating today

11:28.367 --> 11:30.433
is why her teeth are on
the hood of this car

11:30.467 --> 11:31.900
and not in her mouth.

11:31.933 --> 11:33.333
-And why Rodney's bleeding
from the head.

11:33.367 --> 11:34.367
-She took them out before.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.467
-(mumbling)
-She just threw them.

11:35.500 --> 11:36.900
-That's what
she keeps telling them.

11:36.933 --> 11:38.067
-She ain't no baseball player.

11:38.067 --> 11:39.233
-How close was she?

11:40.233 --> 11:43.167
From here to that...
(mumbling), man.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.833
-That's why she-- No.

11:44.867 --> 11:46.500
-She was 30, 40, 50 feet
from you?

11:46.533 --> 11:48.533
-Yeah. Yeah, there's no way
she hit me in the face.

11:48.567 --> 11:50.967
-She keeps telling him
that she did.
-There's no way she hit me.

11:51.067 --> 11:52.900
-She's acting like
she was this close.

11:52.933 --> 11:53.967
-No, sir.

11:54.067 --> 11:55.333
-Okay, all right.

11:55.367 --> 11:57.700
So, if we don't really
have an aggressor,

11:57.733 --> 12:00.067
we don't really have
a domestic violence
that occurred.

12:00.067 --> 12:01.800
Just some teeth
that got flung somehow, and--

12:01.833 --> 12:03.300
-Right out of anger.

12:03.333 --> 12:06.167
-Somebody got hit indirectly,
so where do you want
to go with it?

12:06.200 --> 12:09.633
-Her friend, Kristen, is saying
that she'd be more than happy
to take her.

12:09.667 --> 12:11.133
She lives in Gibsonton.

12:11.167 --> 12:13.933
So, there's no way that--
in Mary's condition,

12:13.967 --> 12:15.600
that she'd be able
to walk back...
-Yeah. Yeah.

12:15.633 --> 12:17.667
We won't have to worry
about this again.

12:17.700 --> 12:20.900
So, yeah.
She'll take Mary and her teeth
and go out of town.

12:20.933 --> 12:22.167
-Squash it. Yeah.
-Cool.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.533
I think it'll work.
-Okay.

12:23.567 --> 12:26.333
-All right, Mary. So this
is what's going on. Okay?

12:26.367 --> 12:28.600
When I got out of the car,
you told me you had
hit your dad.

12:28.633 --> 12:29.967
-Yes, sir, I sure did.
-All right.

12:30.067 --> 12:32.267
We went and talked to your dad.
He said something different.

12:32.300 --> 12:33.333
-Okay?
-Okay.

12:33.367 --> 12:35.167
-So, because of
two different stories,

12:35.200 --> 12:37.667
and not having anybody else
to really bring it together

12:37.700 --> 12:40.067
and let us know
what the truth is
in this investigation...

12:40.067 --> 12:41.467
-Listen--
-we're doing this.

12:41.500 --> 12:44.067
We're gonna resolve it
by allowing you to go
with your friend

12:44.067 --> 12:45.733
and you're gonna leave town.
-Yes, sir.

12:45.767 --> 12:48.067
-You're gonna go down
to Gibsonton. You are gonna
hang out there tonight.

12:48.067 --> 12:49.467
You're not coming back up here.
-Yes.

12:49.500 --> 12:50.833
No, sir.

12:50.867 --> 12:52.767
-So, I don't have to worry
about you being violent up here.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.067
-Oh, no sir.
-All right?

12:54.067 --> 12:55.567
-You don't have to be worried
about me at all.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.300
I just need my stuff
for my teeth.

12:57.333 --> 12:59.633
-Okay. I'm just
letting you know
what's going on.

12:59.667 --> 13:01.900
-Kristen's gonna get
all your stuff and she's gonna
get you going.

13:01.933 --> 13:03.400
-Okay?
-You don't have no money

13:03.433 --> 13:06.333
and the guy just gave you
(bleep) $155?

13:06.367 --> 13:07.667
-No, we didn't.
-Mary, Mary, Mary.

13:07.700 --> 13:09.300
-Y'all need to stop arguing.

13:09.333 --> 13:11.600
Get your legs in the car,
let's go.
-Yeah, okay. Go, man!

13:11.633 --> 13:13.067
Get out of my face then.

13:13.100 --> 13:15.333
-Okay.
-Move, get the (bleep) of here.

13:15.367 --> 13:16.533
-Kristen: Stop!

13:16.567 --> 13:17.567
-Get the (bleep) out!

13:17.600 --> 13:18.667
-Have a good night, Mary.

13:18.700 --> 13:20.333
-Well, now we only got
one pair of dentures

13:20.367 --> 13:22.667
to worry about
in this house, so hopefully
we'll be all right tonight.

13:22.700 --> 13:23.733
-Absolutely.

13:25.633 --> 13:27.667
-Deputy:
I've always enjoyed
a night shift schedule.

13:27.700 --> 13:30.700
You know, even growing up
I always kind of lived on
a night shift schedule.

13:30.733 --> 13:32.800
And then,
from a policing aspect,

13:32.833 --> 13:36.367
I really enjoy
being able to focus
on the proactive patrol,

13:36.400 --> 13:38.567
focusing on
narcotic-related crimes.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.133
You know, your burglaries
and stuff like that.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.833
Less traffic on the road,
you can really, um,

13:42.867 --> 13:44.733
get into some proactive stuff.

13:44.767 --> 13:47.467
-Officer over radio:
Hey guys, I just had a car
up in front of me turn.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.067
Took off on
a high rate of speed.

13:49.067 --> 13:50.700
Gonna be coming out
on First Street.

13:50.733 --> 13:52.500
-(radio beeps)
-Deputy Lewis:
Yeah, I got it here.

13:52.533 --> 13:54.100
We're gonna stop it
at the Speedway.

13:54.133 --> 13:56.933
-We're gonna stop this car,
it just blew the stop sign
back there.

13:56.967 --> 14:00.600
Sixth and... 301 and it was
flying through the back streets.

14:00.633 --> 14:02.067
-Stay in the car,
stay in the car.

14:02.067 --> 14:03.367
-Oh.
-Stay in the car.

14:03.400 --> 14:04.800
Tag, 22-10-50.

14:06.567 --> 14:09.133
How's it going, man?
You know what happened.

14:09.167 --> 14:10.767
Don't play like that with me.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.567
You trying to dip us
and then you just blow
that stop sign right there.

14:13.600 --> 14:14.967
-Did I? I'm sorry.

14:15.067 --> 14:16.700
-You know you did.
Did you even see the stop sign?

14:16.733 --> 14:18.167
-I'm sorry.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.867
-What's up?
-You got a license?

14:19.900 --> 14:21.200
-Yeah, I do.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.300
-Is your license good?

14:28.333 --> 14:29.767
-Yes, sir.

14:29.800 --> 14:32.133
-You sure? 'Cause you sure were
in a hurry to get away from us.

14:32.167 --> 14:33.767
-No, we just need
to put gas, so...

14:33.800 --> 14:35.300
-You can just hand me
that Corona, man.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.867
-We just needed to put gas.

14:36.900 --> 14:38.333
-Do me a favor, boss.
Step back here for me.

14:40.133 --> 14:41.400
-Got these at the house?

14:41.433 --> 14:42.633
-Sit your butt up right here.

14:42.667 --> 14:44.300
-Huh?
-I was gonna go home.

14:44.333 --> 14:45.700
-Okay, where's home at?

14:45.733 --> 14:48.633
-Um, 32 First Street.

14:48.667 --> 14:50.600
-Okay. Let me
ask you this, boss man.

14:50.633 --> 14:52.667
What's in the car
that's got you so nervous?

14:52.700 --> 14:54.133
What could get you
in trouble in the car?

14:54.167 --> 14:55.933
-There's nothing
in the car, sir.

14:55.967 --> 14:57.100
-You sure?

14:57.133 --> 14:58.600
-Yes, sir.

14:58.633 --> 15:00.633
-Okay, 'cause here's
the worst thing that can
happen for you.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.467
The worst thing
that can happen for you

15:02.500 --> 15:05.700
is if there's something in there
and you're not honest with me
and then I find it.

15:07.067 --> 15:09.100
-What is-- What's the reason
on the stop?

15:09.133 --> 15:12.067
-What did I do?
-That stop sign right there.

15:12.100 --> 15:14.733
-And all these things
for that stop sign?

15:14.767 --> 15:17.067
-Yeah, here's the deal.
I'm asking you.

15:17.067 --> 15:19.367
-I already got pulled over,
I think it's--

15:19.400 --> 15:20.900
-Hey, talk to me.
Look at me and talk to me.

15:20.933 --> 15:24.633
-It's no reason for me
to be here. I gotta go.

15:24.667 --> 15:26.967
-There is a reason
for you to be here.
-Am I being arrested?

15:27.067 --> 15:29.100
Or am I getting a ticket?
I need to go.

15:29.133 --> 15:31.100
That's all I need to say.

15:31.133 --> 15:32.467
-Okay.
-I need to go.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.300
-If you're honest with me,
that can help out a lot.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.500
-There's nothing in the car.
I need to go.

15:41.300 --> 15:43.067
-Do me a favor,
don't move.

15:44.867 --> 15:46.600
Stay there for me.
-Come back here with this guy.

15:46.633 --> 15:48.333
-Rear passenger.

15:48.367 --> 15:49.867
-What do you got?

15:49.900 --> 15:51.800
-I didn't give you
permission to search my car.
It's not right.

15:51.833 --> 15:54.533
-Hey, listen, I don't need
permission at this point,
partner.

15:54.567 --> 15:55.733
Keep your hands
right up there.

15:55.767 --> 15:57.867
Keep your hands
up there.

15:57.900 --> 15:59.800
I don't need permission
when it's in plain view.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.933
-Well, it's not right
for this.

16:01.967 --> 16:03.633
-It's not right when
the marijuana's in plain view.

16:03.667 --> 16:05.667
I don't need a right
to search your car.

16:05.700 --> 16:07.500
-Big bag of marijuana

16:07.533 --> 16:09.300
in the backseat.

16:09.333 --> 16:12.233
Looks like we're gonna have
some marijuana and either
some cocaine or some heroin.

16:12.267 --> 16:14.433
Probably about 10 or 15 grams
of marijuana, it looks like.

16:14.467 --> 16:16.600
-He's searching my car
without a warrant right now.
-Okay, yes.

16:16.633 --> 16:17.933
-This is illegal right now.

16:17.967 --> 16:20.467
-Again, let me--
-You know it's illegal
right now.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.433
-It's not, it's not illegal.
-What you're doing
is illegal.

16:22.467 --> 16:23.633
-We can see this
in plain view.

16:23.667 --> 16:24.867
-You know you didn't see that.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.667
It's illegal
what you're doing right now.

16:26.700 --> 16:28.267
I will sue this.
-Be quiet. Be quiet.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.200
You know I'm gonna beat it
'cause this is illegal.

16:30.233 --> 16:33.700
-Hey, we'll all give you
our badge numbers and we work
for the Sheriff's Department.

16:33.733 --> 16:36.433
That looks like a big bag
of cocaine there.

16:36.467 --> 16:38.633
-Boss, here's what
I'm gonna tell you.

16:38.667 --> 16:40.833
I know
you're a little agitated,
you're nervous.

16:40.867 --> 16:43.700
I know that you were confused
why we started searching
your car. Here's why.

16:43.733 --> 16:45.400
When he was standing up there,

16:45.433 --> 16:48.500
clear as day in the back pocket
of that front passenger seat,

16:48.533 --> 16:50.233
you can see the big bag of weed.
-No, you couldn't.

16:50.267 --> 16:51.867
-There's no way that you can.
-Hey, listen to me.

16:51.900 --> 16:53.800
-There's no way that you can.
You can't see.
-Listen to me.

16:53.833 --> 16:55.100
You can't see that.

16:55.133 --> 16:56.767
I'mma fight this
no matter what.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.767
-Okay. Okay.
-'Cause there's no way
that you can see that.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.567
-Listen to me,
if you don't want
to be cooperative,

17:00.600 --> 17:02.300
just tell me now
and I'll put you in the back

17:02.333 --> 17:04.800
and we can take you down
and hit you with a few felonies
and it can be a wrap.

17:04.833 --> 17:07.533
I'm trying to give you a chance
man-to-man to talk to me.
-Do what you're gonna do.

17:07.567 --> 17:08.733
-I want you
to be straight with me.

17:08.767 --> 17:10.733
-What? What you want me to say?

17:10.767 --> 17:14.167
-How much soft is that, man?
Is that like a quarter
of an ounce or what?

17:14.200 --> 17:15.667
-I don't even know.

17:15.700 --> 17:18.133
-What would you guess?
How much-- I mean,
it's not an ounce, is it?

17:18.167 --> 17:20.300
'Cause an ounce is trafficking,
and that's what you don't want.

17:20.333 --> 17:22.767
-But I feel like somebody
put that in my car.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.867
-Be still. Here's the deal,

17:24.900 --> 17:27.067
if we play
this whole dumb game--

17:27.100 --> 17:31.633
-My best friend for some reason
went to jail two days-- today.

17:31.667 --> 17:33.567
He got out last night.

17:33.600 --> 17:36.667
Ain't no way. I don't even,
I don't even sell weed.

17:36.700 --> 17:38.167
I don't even-- What?

17:38.200 --> 17:39.833
I don't even-- Coke,
what the (bleep)?

17:39.867 --> 17:41.200
In my car?

17:42.800 --> 17:43.933
-Be still. Quit walking around.

17:43.967 --> 17:45.367
-I don't know how
that got there.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.333
-Look, if you stick with
the story, "Dude, I had no idea

17:47.367 --> 17:51.233
that a quarter of soft
is right in my car,"

17:51.267 --> 17:53.933
right where
your emergency break is,
right where your arm sits--

17:53.967 --> 17:56.233
Then you and I both know
that's gonna be crazy.

17:56.267 --> 17:59.600
And I'm gonna fingerprint
and DNA touch test the bag.

17:59.633 --> 18:01.333
Okay?

18:01.367 --> 18:03.533
I think you sell a little bit
of soft to make a little bit
of extra money,

18:03.567 --> 18:05.233
which I can totally understand.
-I don't sell coke.

18:05.267 --> 18:06.700
-So you do it?

18:06.733 --> 18:08.267
-Maybe.

18:08.300 --> 18:10.467
-Okay.
-I do some coke.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.300
-Okay. Just every now and then,
just to party?
-Yeah.

18:12.333 --> 18:13.967
-Okay, so how much is that?

18:14.067 --> 18:15.867
Is that gonna be 28 grams?

18:15.900 --> 18:17.567
-No.
-Okay, about how much
is it?

18:17.600 --> 18:19.367
-I don't know.
-What would you guess?

18:19.400 --> 18:20.967
-It's cold out here.

18:21.067 --> 18:22.300
-Huh?
-It's cold.

18:22.333 --> 18:24.067
-Okay, do you want to talk
in the backseat of a car?

18:24.067 --> 18:25.533
-Let's go.
-Okay.

18:25.567 --> 18:27.733
-The silver truck over here.

18:27.767 --> 18:30.467
Jay, will you,
will you unlock it?

18:30.500 --> 18:33.500
(clears throat) How much
did you buy that soft for?

18:33.533 --> 18:35.533
-$50.
-$50?

18:35.567 --> 18:37.267
How much were you gonna
try to get from it?

18:37.300 --> 18:38.667
-I was just gonna do it.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.300
-Just gonna do it? Okay.

18:40.333 --> 18:42.600
-Yeah, I was.
-How much weed is it? Is it
just like 10 grams or something?

18:43.633 --> 18:44.633
-It's an ounce.

18:44.667 --> 18:45.833
-It's an ounce? Okay.

18:45.867 --> 18:47.133
Let me ask you this,

18:47.167 --> 18:49.067
your boy
that you're riding with,
is any of that his?

18:49.100 --> 18:50.733
-No. He don't have
nothing to do with it.

18:50.767 --> 18:52.933
-Does he have any reason
to go to jail tonight?
-No.

18:52.967 --> 18:56.433
-So you're saying
you're not selling either
the soft or the weed?

18:56.467 --> 18:58.633
-No, that's mine.
That's what I do.

18:58.667 --> 19:00.933
-Okay, is that why you were
so excited to jump out the car?

19:00.967 --> 19:03.167
-What you mean
"jump out the car"?

19:03.200 --> 19:04.900
I was gonna put gas.

19:04.933 --> 19:07.333
I didn't even know
you guys was following me.

19:07.367 --> 19:09.767
-You were just
driving like that just 'cause?

19:09.800 --> 19:11.067
-That's how I drive.

19:11.067 --> 19:12.700
-Okay.
-I didn't even know you guys
were following--

19:12.733 --> 19:14.433
I didn't even know
where y'all was at.

19:14.467 --> 19:16.067
-Okay.

19:16.067 --> 19:19.300
-That's why I find it curious
when I pull up just to
the gas station,

19:19.333 --> 19:20.967
you guys pull up behind me.

19:21.067 --> 19:22.933
-Look, lean out here, boss.
See that stop sign out there?

19:22.967 --> 19:24.467
Did you even know
there was a stop sign there?

19:24.500 --> 19:26.067
-I did, but--
-'Cause there were
no cars coming,

19:26.067 --> 19:27.733
you just thought
you had a chance?

19:27.767 --> 19:29.900
-I did stop for a little bit
and then kept going.
-No. Not at this stop sign.

19:29.933 --> 19:31.367
-I didn't stop fully,
but I did stop.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.233
-All right,
sit tight for me, man.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.600
-He 'fessed up?

19:36.633 --> 19:38.633
-Yeah, he said he's not
selling it but it's his coke.

19:38.667 --> 19:39.933
Said that's an ounce of weed.

19:39.967 --> 19:41.733
He said that the passenger
has nothing to do with it.

19:41.767 --> 19:44.067
He said, "Everything's mine,
the coke's mine,
the weed's mine."

19:44.067 --> 19:46.767
So, we're just gonna
charge him with possession
of marijuana over 20

19:46.800 --> 19:48.433
and possession of cocaine.

19:49.967 --> 19:52.133
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.167 --> 19:54.233
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.267 --> 19:55.267
Cover is code three.

19:55.300 --> 19:58.267
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:05.000 --> 20:06.967
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.167
-(theme music playing)
