WEBVTT

00:04.338 --> 00:05.506
Hey, guys.

00:05.539 --> 00:07.075
Hey, Uncle Nathan.

00:07.108 --> 00:09.043
Hey, you want breakfast?
Adam just made smoothies.

00:09.077 --> 00:11.079
ADAM: Yeah, this is
a new thing we've been
cooking up down at the cafe.

00:11.112 --> 00:14.148
It's got seaweed, fish
oil, kelp and plankton.

00:14.182 --> 00:15.749
And a little
splash of blueberry.

00:15.783 --> 00:16.750
Oh.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.752
(chuckles)
Mmm.

00:18.786 --> 00:20.721
Mmm. Mm-hmm. Mmm.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.290
Is it too sweet?

00:22.323 --> 00:24.758
Tastes like somebody dropped
a Popsicle in a tide pool.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.529
How come he gets to spit out
his food but I can't?

00:28.562 --> 00:30.564
Your uncle's given a lot
of money to help our business.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.066
Not given. Loaned.

00:32.100 --> 00:32.733
And as a partner...

00:32.766 --> 00:33.734
Not a partner.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.103
Guilt tripped at a barbeque.

00:35.136 --> 00:37.438
He can spit out
whatever he chooses.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.640
Now finish that, please,
and go get ready for school.

00:39.673 --> 00:42.076
Speaking of loans...

00:42.110 --> 00:43.577
Oh, thanks. Mom's been asking
about the rent money.

00:43.611 --> 00:44.678
Yeah, we'll pay you back.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.580
It's just been a little bit
slow down at the cafe.

00:46.614 --> 00:47.581
But you know
what they say:

00:47.615 --> 00:50.184
every new business loses
money for the first...

00:50.218 --> 00:51.285
ten years.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.122
Oh, turn this up.
It's gonna be me.

00:54.155 --> 00:57.125
WOMAN: What do you do
when conventional parenting

00:57.158 --> 00:58.592
just isn't doing the trick?

00:58.626 --> 01:00.828
Our own Nathan Miller reports.

01:00.861 --> 01:02.496
NATHAN:
While this type of discipline

01:02.530 --> 01:03.464
may seem unorthodox to some,

01:03.497 --> 01:05.699
not everyone
in the neighborhood sees this

01:05.733 --> 01:07.735
as cruel and unusual punishment.

01:07.768 --> 01:09.503
It's about time his
parents did something.

01:09.537 --> 01:11.572
I'd like to see his jackass
brother wearing a sign

01:11.605 --> 01:14.742
that says, "I say mean things
about mature women's breasts."

01:14.775 --> 01:17.745
Well, apparently gravity is not
the only one who can be cruel.

01:17.778 --> 01:20.414
(phone ringing)

01:20.448 --> 01:22.716
Ooh, Myrtle Beach
area code.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.518
(phone beeps)

01:24.552 --> 01:25.353
Hello?

01:25.386 --> 01:27.221
Your father flooded
the basement.

01:27.255 --> 01:29.357
Again?
Yep. Same way.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.159
Left the hose on all night.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.894
Claims he got distracted
by a skinny squirrel.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.430
Dad flooded the basement again.

01:36.464 --> 01:37.565
(gasps) Nathan's here.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.467
I'm gonna put you
on speaker.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.701
No, no, no.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.203
Hey, hey! Mom?

01:42.236 --> 01:43.604
Hey.

01:43.637 --> 01:44.872
Debbie, we're driving up
to stay with you

01:44.905 --> 01:46.574
until the landlord
dries things out,

01:46.607 --> 01:48.576
but your father said he needed
to ask you something.

01:48.609 --> 01:49.810
Tom, pick up.

01:49.843 --> 01:51.579
Whoa. You're coming here today?

01:51.612 --> 01:54.582
(phone auto-dialing)

01:54.615 --> 01:56.550
Good Lord. Could you pick up
the phone one time

01:56.584 --> 01:59.353
without hitting the redial
button with your chin?

01:59.387 --> 02:01.289
It's like your idiot
trumpet fanfare

02:01.322 --> 02:04.525
announcing the king
of stupidity has arrived.

02:04.558 --> 02:05.526
Hello?

02:05.559 --> 02:06.694
Hey, Dad.

02:06.727 --> 02:09.397
What kind of toothpaste
do you have?

02:09.430 --> 02:10.664
The tube kind.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.533
Are you not
packing toothpaste?

02:12.566 --> 02:16.770
Your mother said not to waste
ours 'cause I can use yours.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.639
I can't believe we're paying
long distance for this.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.308
It's toothpaste, Tom.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.243
You can use
whatever they have.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.245
Cinnamon hurts my tongue.

02:24.278 --> 02:26.314
This is ridiculous.
We'll see you tonight.

02:26.347 --> 02:27.615
Tom, hang up the phone.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.418
She never answered
about the toothpaste!

02:30.451 --> 02:31.885
It's not cinnamon, Dad.

02:31.919 --> 02:35.256
Okay, good.
'Cause cinnamon hurts my tongue.

02:35.289 --> 02:36.924
Tom, hang up!

02:36.957 --> 02:38.692
Debbie, we'll see
you tonight.

02:38.726 --> 02:41.362
Nathan, did Janice read
the article I sent her

02:41.395 --> 02:43.231
about fertility tips?

02:43.264 --> 02:44.865
Um...

02:44.898 --> 02:46.734
Uh, yes, I think she did.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.736
Were the positions helpful?

02:48.769 --> 02:51.339
They looked dangerous.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.841
Have a safe trip, Mom.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.075
(phone beeps)
(chuckles)

02:55.108 --> 02:58.712
I got to say, when you first
told me not to tell Mom and Dad

02:58.746 --> 03:01.215
about the divorce,
I had my doubts.

03:01.249 --> 03:03.351
But lying to them
has been really fun.

03:03.384 --> 03:06.520
I feel like I'm back
in my shoplifting days.

03:06.554 --> 03:07.588
Well, thanks. I got to say,

03:07.621 --> 03:09.757
I'm a little surprised
you haven't told them yet.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.692
Are you kidding me?
The golden child gets a divorce

03:11.725 --> 03:13.327
and now he's hiding it
from them?

03:14.695 --> 03:16.464
Suddenly, getting knocked up
at a yoga retreat

03:16.497 --> 03:20.301
by the Mid-Atlantic Hacky Sack
champion doesn't look so bad.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.435
Let's just get
through this visit.

03:21.469 --> 03:24.438
I know that I have to tell them
sooner or later, but...

03:24.472 --> 03:27.508
later just feels so right.

03:27.541 --> 03:30.278
NATHAN: So the next time your
kid blurts out a naughty word,

03:30.311 --> 03:31.945
instead of reaching
for the soap,

03:31.979 --> 03:34.815
maybe send him outside
for a little public humiliation.

03:34.848 --> 03:37.685
Did you learn your
lesson, Zachary?

03:37.718 --> 03:39.420
Shut up, (bleep),

03:39.453 --> 03:41.822
before I wrap your (bleep)
around your (bleep)

03:41.855 --> 03:45.459
and shove my (bleep)
in your (bleep) (bleep).

03:47.461 --> 03:49.630
I'm Nathan Miller,
walking your streets.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.007
Come on, just one
little party.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.809
I'll invite
some girls over.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.911
You didn't get a divorce
from Janice so you could

04:03.944 --> 04:05.879
sit around the house
alone every night.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.014
I just don't know if
I'm ready to get back

04:07.047 --> 04:09.283
into the whole dating game.
You're on TV

04:09.317 --> 04:10.618
and you are wasting it!

04:10.651 --> 04:12.553
You think when I was
on assignment with Geraldo

04:12.586 --> 04:14.888
in Afghanistan, he wasn't using
his celebrity status

04:14.922 --> 04:16.590
to get some Mideast tail?

04:16.624 --> 04:18.592
You're telling me
that Geraldo Rivera

04:18.626 --> 04:20.594
slept with a lot
of Afghani women?

04:20.628 --> 04:22.296
Well, I'm not really sure
'cause they put him

04:22.330 --> 04:23.297
in a different hotel than me.

04:23.331 --> 04:25.733
But if he didn't,
he's a fool just like you.

04:26.767 --> 04:27.668
All right, you're right.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.670
Maybe I can have
one little party.
Good.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.038
Invite some girls.
Yes.

04:31.071 --> 04:32.573
Yeah, maybe
it's... Yeah.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.308
Maybe it's time for me
to get back on that horse.

04:34.342 --> 04:37.478
Get on that horse!
Giddyup! (whoops)

04:39.480 --> 04:41.849
(doorbell ringing)

04:43.584 --> 04:45.052
What are you doing here?

04:45.085 --> 04:46.920
You're supposed
to be staying at Debbie's.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.522
We had a fight.

04:48.556 --> 04:50.391
She painted
my purple room green.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.660
It's called "the purple room."
How can it be green?

04:52.693 --> 04:54.995
She thinks just because she
pays us rent-- and don't think

04:55.028 --> 04:56.864
I don't know where that money
is coming from--

04:56.897 --> 04:59.467
she's allowed to redecorate
my house all willy-nilly.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.968
Can I have some water?

05:01.001 --> 05:02.870
After all this rigmarole,

05:02.903 --> 05:04.938
I'll never get to sleep
without my pill.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.073
Yeah, I'll get it. Just...

05:06.106 --> 05:08.008
have a seat, both of you.

05:08.041 --> 05:09.910
Check your pedometer.

05:09.943 --> 05:12.380
The doctor said
10,000 steps a day.

05:12.413 --> 05:15.048
Eighty-nine.

05:15.082 --> 05:18.652
No, no. Wait a minute.
I-It's upside-down.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.688
Sixty-eight.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.425
Get some exercise
and take the bags upstairs.

05:24.458 --> 05:27.227
I don't want you to die before
your life insurance matures.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.133
What are you doing?

05:33.166 --> 05:34.935
Getting you water.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.438
I don't want to use up
all your fancy bottled water.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.373
It's the same thing
that comes out of the faucet

05:39.407 --> 05:41.141
for ten times the price.
Pour it back.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.076
Look, Mom, what
does it matter?

05:43.110 --> 05:44.077
It's already...
I've-I've already poured...

05:44.111 --> 05:46.947
God, it's not worth it.
It's so not worth it.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.115
(yelps)
Don't spill it!

05:48.148 --> 05:49.450
It's expensive!

05:49.483 --> 05:50.418
I'm doing the best I can!

05:50.451 --> 05:52.753
It's not engineered
to go in this direction!

05:57.525 --> 06:00.894
Where are all those Colonial
Williamsburg throw pillows

06:00.928 --> 06:02.696
I gave Janice for Christmas?

06:02.730 --> 06:04.465
You didn't get rid
of those, did you?

06:04.498 --> 06:05.533
No. No, no, no.

06:05.566 --> 06:08.836
I-I think half of them
are still here somewhere.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.505
Where's Janice?
She's not upstairs.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.641
Y-Yeah.
A-About Janice.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.976
Wh-Why don't you both sit down
for a sec.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.711
Why would we need to sit down?

06:17.745 --> 06:18.979
Where's Janice?

06:20.213 --> 06:22.716
Is Janice dead?

06:22.750 --> 06:25.519
It wasn't one of those dangerous
sex positions, was it?

06:25.553 --> 06:26.854
No.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.456
No, Janice is not dead.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.190
Please, just sit down.
No.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.159
People always tell you bad
news when you sit down.

06:32.192 --> 06:34.061
I'm gonna stand.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.463
Okay, but whether
you're standing or sitting,

06:35.496 --> 06:36.930
I'm still gonna say
the same thing.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.900
We'll see about that.
I'm gonna stand.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.935
Great. Fine. Stand.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.138
Janice and I split up.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.574
What?!

06:46.607 --> 06:48.175
Janice and I got divorced.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.678
(high-pitched):
What?!

06:50.711 --> 06:53.747
No, no, no, no, no, no!
You're not getting divorced!

06:53.781 --> 06:56.517
Well, we already did
and it's okay. I'm very happy.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.886
I'm very, very... Come on,
Dad. Don't be like that.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.688
Dad, don't you want
your son to be happy?

07:00.721 --> 07:02.222
I'm very happy.
(gags)

07:02.255 --> 07:04.592
What are you doing?
I'm trying to get
the sleeping pill up.

07:04.625 --> 07:05.926
I can't fall asleep now.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.195
We're in the middle
of an emergency! (gags)

07:08.228 --> 07:09.162
Mom, we're not in an emergency.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.498
This happened three months ago.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.165
Three months?
I have to call her.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.001
(gags)
What's her number?

07:14.034 --> 07:16.003
What's her number?!
(gags)
No, please.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.538
Just don't throw up.

07:17.571 --> 07:18.806
I can't believe
this is happening.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.974
You got married in my church.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.476
(gags loudly)

07:22.510 --> 07:24.211
You were both so happy!

07:24.244 --> 07:27.214
For your first dance, you danced
the dance from Dirty Dancing.

07:27.247 --> 07:30.951
That's not the kind of marriage
that ends in divorce.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.219
We only danced to that song

07:32.252 --> 07:33.487
because
it's your favorite movie.

07:33.521 --> 07:36.557
And don't forget, you refused to
come unless we agreed to do it.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.492
And it was so romantic,
people cried.

07:38.526 --> 07:40.628
You're welcome.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.830
Look, Mom, it's-it's a lot...

07:42.863 --> 07:45.232
Dad, what are you doing?
Leaving.

07:45.265 --> 07:46.166
Oh, Tom, stop it.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.869
I'm not crawling back
to Debbie's house.

07:48.902 --> 07:52.072
Oh, you're not coming with me.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.509
Excuse me?

07:55.543 --> 07:58.011
43 years of marriage.

07:58.045 --> 08:03.283
43 years of mah mah mah
blabbity blah blah blah.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.718
And every time

08:04.752 --> 08:06.153
I brought up divorce,

08:06.186 --> 08:08.822
you convinced me we had to
stay together for the children.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.624
First they were too young,

08:10.658 --> 08:11.959
and they needed
both their parents.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.227
Then they were in college,
and that kind of turmoil

08:14.261 --> 08:15.963
could disrupt their education.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.231
Then, after they got
married themselves,

08:18.265 --> 08:20.100
God forbid we set a bad example

08:20.133 --> 08:22.235
and show them that divorce
is an option.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.837
Well, apparently
it is an option.

08:23.871 --> 08:25.673
This one gets divorced
after three years

08:25.706 --> 08:28.976
just because
he wants to be happy?!

08:30.978 --> 08:32.546
Happy?!

08:32.580 --> 08:34.014
Well, guess what!

08:34.047 --> 08:35.783
I want to be happy!

08:38.952 --> 08:40.621
Come on, Dad, you can't do this.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.322
You've been married
for 43 years.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.925
Let's call it 33,
since we haven't had sex in ten.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.293
That's not true.

08:46.326 --> 08:49.697
Last year, on your birthday,
in the shower.

08:49.730 --> 08:52.032
Oh, my God.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.101
You walked in
on me masturbating!

08:54.134 --> 08:57.004
Oh, please stop. Please...

08:57.037 --> 08:59.072
And I stayed until you finished
your business!

08:59.106 --> 09:00.774
That counts!

09:00.808 --> 09:03.343
I think I'm gonna black out!

09:03.376 --> 09:04.912
No, it doesn't count.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.313
It doesn't count
because you were

09:06.346 --> 09:08.749
criticizing me the whole time!

09:08.782 --> 09:10.618
You were doing it wrong!

09:12.085 --> 09:14.221
Who holds it like that?!

09:14.254 --> 09:16.356
Your child is in the room!

09:16.389 --> 09:17.858
I'm done, Carol.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.727
If he gets to be single,
so do I.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.262
And find someone else
to put cream on your feet,

09:22.295 --> 09:24.698
since I never could
do it right anyway.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.366
You run your fingers
between my toes

09:26.399 --> 09:28.769
like you're sawing
a piece of wood!

09:28.802 --> 09:30.971
I wish I was sawing
a piece of wood.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.607
I'd get less splinters!

09:39.412 --> 09:41.615
Look what you did.

09:50.090 --> 09:53.861
So far, being single
has been amazing.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.697
I didn't have to make his coffee
for him this morning.

09:56.730 --> 10:00.167
I didn't have to remind him not
to put metal in the microwave.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.703
I swear to God, I should've
gotten a tax deduction

10:02.736 --> 10:04.872
for living with that man.
(laughs)

10:04.905 --> 10:09.409
Mom, did you clip my toenails
while I was sleeping?

10:09.442 --> 10:11.411
Just a smidge.
Not enough to wake you.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.914
But now that you're up,
I'd like to have another shot

10:13.947 --> 10:15.415
at that left pinky.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.549
Oh, will we be here

10:16.583 --> 10:19.286
between 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.
a week from Saturday?

10:19.319 --> 10:20.888
I don't know. Why?
Who are you talking to?

10:20.921 --> 10:24.391
Oh, some woman named Achudalic
or Achugala or Achu...

10:24.424 --> 10:25.525
Sweetheart, I hear you,

10:25.558 --> 10:28.862
but every time you say it,
it sounds different to me.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.731
She works
for the moving company.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.900
I'm having all my stuff shipped
from Myrtle Beach.

10:32.933 --> 10:33.901
What?!

10:33.934 --> 10:36.336
She doesn't need her stuff!

10:36.369 --> 10:38.005
Mom, you and I
can't live together.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.940
No, I-I didn't get divorced
from one controlling woman

10:39.973 --> 10:42.009
just to turn around and become
roomies again with the...

10:42.042 --> 10:44.177
original puppet master.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.979
You're getting a call.

10:46.013 --> 10:48.315
Hold on, Appaloosa.

10:48.348 --> 10:49.950
(phone beeps)
Hello.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.985
You're gonna have
to get over here.

10:53.153 --> 10:56.156
Ow! Oh!

10:56.189 --> 10:59.960
You're gonna have
to get over here now.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.697
I didn't know it was a rule
for all microwaves.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.833
I thought it was just
the one at our house

11:05.866 --> 11:08.268
that you couldn't
put metal in.

11:08.301 --> 11:10.871
Why do my parents
call you Forrest Gump?

11:12.505 --> 11:13.340
I don't know.

11:13.373 --> 11:16.443
Maybe they think I
look like Tom Hanks.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.347
What happened to lying?
I like lying.

11:20.380 --> 11:21.715
Why did you tell them
about Janice?

11:21.749 --> 11:22.850
Look at what you started.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.017
Me? You're the one

11:24.051 --> 11:25.352
who painted
the purple room green.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.920
You lit the fuse.

11:26.954 --> 11:28.789
You... lit the fuse.

11:28.822 --> 11:31.491
Okay, well, we have to fix this.
I can't take care of Dad.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.060
Great. You want to switch?
I'll take Dad.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.061
Oh, no.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.829
You and Mom should be together.

11:35.863 --> 11:38.198
You're very similar.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.034
Well, that was uncalled for.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.503
Check it out.
Band-Aids!

11:43.536 --> 11:46.273
If your cheap mother was here,
she'd fold up a little square

11:46.306 --> 11:49.409
of toilet paper and stick it on
with Scotch Tape.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.979
Or maybe she would have
stopped you from putting metal

11:52.012 --> 11:54.014
in the microwave
and flushing your bathrobe belt

11:54.047 --> 11:55.382
down the toilet this morning.

11:55.415 --> 11:56.516
That was crazy.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.919
Spun me around like a top.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.491
So when someone asks you
what it looks like

12:04.524 --> 12:06.326
when they fill
a sinkhole back up...

12:08.862 --> 12:10.831
...well, now you know.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.332
I'm Nathan Miller,

12:12.365 --> 12:15.903
walking your once-again...

12:15.936 --> 12:17.470
sturdy streets.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.975
Oh, you were just on TV!

12:22.009 --> 12:25.178
When are they gonna give you
any of the real stories?

12:25.212 --> 12:27.480
Well, you know what? You got to
work your way up, Mom.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.416
Even old Brian Williams
started...

12:29.449 --> 12:30.450
(sniffs)

12:31.852 --> 12:34.187
Did you fart?

12:35.322 --> 12:37.190
(sniffs)

12:39.192 --> 12:41.128
Yes.

12:41.161 --> 12:44.097
Gross! Go outside or something.

12:44.131 --> 12:46.499
Well, I didn't know
about it. You'll see.

12:46.533 --> 12:49.069
This happens when you get older;
they just slip out.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.370
Oh, my God.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.172
Oh, relax, it's a fart.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.306
(laughs)

12:53.340 --> 12:55.542
Some people think they're funny.

12:55.575 --> 12:56.409
Yeah, but when
you can hear them.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.078
When you can hear them,
they're funny.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.514
Without sound,
they're just gross.

13:01.548 --> 13:04.117
(laughing):
You're acting silly.

13:04.151 --> 13:07.187
You're a silly Billy.

13:07.220 --> 13:10.423
Silly Billy beary, that's you.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.459
(doorbell rings)
Have you been
drinking?

13:12.492 --> 13:14.561
No. I took a sleeping pill.

13:14.594 --> 13:17.197
All this change has
my head full of snakes.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.431
Can't relax.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.968
Party time! Whoo!

13:21.001 --> 13:23.036
Aw, man.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.872
If that's the girl I
met on the Internet,

13:24.905 --> 13:27.374
she was lying
to me big-time.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.877
That woman is
not Tahitian.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.979
Ray, this is my mother.
Mom, this is Ray.

13:32.012 --> 13:34.114
(gasps)
Nice to meet you!

13:34.147 --> 13:36.283
Well, nice to meet you.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.186
Apparently,
I passed gas recently,

13:39.219 --> 13:43.891
so if that's made its way over
into your area, I apologize.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.926
I definitely walked into
something over here,

13:45.959 --> 13:47.627
but I wasn't gonna
say anything.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.230
Your mother raised you right.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.299
Listen, I don't think I can
have a party here tonight.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.401
I kind of got
some family stuff going on.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.136
Oh, that's ridiculous.
Have your party.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.138
I'm going to bed.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.506
No, you won't
bother me.

13:59.539 --> 14:00.507
(chuckles)

14:00.540 --> 14:02.109
Uh-oh!

14:02.142 --> 14:03.510
(laughs)

14:03.543 --> 14:04.577
Ooh!

14:04.611 --> 14:06.880
(whoops)
(laughing)

14:06.914 --> 14:08.648
I like her.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.150
Whee!

14:11.684 --> 14:14.321
I'll open the wine,
you open a window.

14:25.065 --> 14:27.034
Hey, what are you doing?

14:27.067 --> 14:29.069
I'm watching my dad
try and figure out

14:29.102 --> 14:30.570
how to work the TV.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.005
(laughs)
There is no way

14:32.039 --> 14:34.074
he's gonna figure that out
on his own.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.575
You should've seen me earlier
when I was trying

14:35.608 --> 14:37.510
to teach him
how to use the ice dispenser.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.212
You know,
I started yelling at him

14:39.246 --> 14:40.513
and he was panicking,
and I just...

14:40.547 --> 14:42.682
I felt really bad,
so I started crying a lot,

14:42.715 --> 14:44.351
you know,
and there was ice

14:44.384 --> 14:45.652
all over the pla...
It was like

14:45.685 --> 14:47.587
the last ten minutes
of Titanic in here.

14:47.620 --> 14:48.455
Well, you're done
helping him,

14:48.488 --> 14:50.290
because if he gets
frustrated enough,

14:50.323 --> 14:52.459
maybe he'll realize
he can't live on his own,

14:52.492 --> 14:54.361
and he'll go
running back to my mom.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.428
Yeah.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.198
(mechanical rumbling)

14:58.231 --> 15:00.233
I think he just opened
the garage door.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.936
Uh, that closed it again.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.204
Uh, it's opening.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.405
And closing.

15:05.438 --> 15:09.109
You know, he really must hate
what he's watching right now.

15:15.983 --> 15:18.651
I found one that still
watches the news.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.720
NATHAN:
She's really cute.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.023
Yeah. She's a
student-slash-barista-

15:23.056 --> 15:24.291
slash-personal trainer-

15:24.324 --> 15:27.227
slash-amateur
trapeze artist.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.996
She's got a lot going on.

15:29.029 --> 15:29.829
Indeed.

15:29.862 --> 15:32.299
She also owns a
saltwater fish tank.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.301
Those are not easy
to maintain.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.302
(laughs)

15:35.335 --> 15:37.337
(rock music playing downstairs)

15:49.682 --> 15:53.653
So, Ray tells me you haven't
had sex since your divorce.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.288
Did he say that?

15:55.322 --> 15:58.225
God, it's nice of him
to share that information.

15:58.258 --> 16:00.160
WOMAN: Don't worry,
I think it's cool.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.395
I've always wanted
to be someone's first.

16:02.429 --> 16:05.732
Do you think "first
after a divorce" could count?

16:05.765 --> 16:09.736
Well, I'd-I'd be willing
to bend the rules if you are.

16:09.769 --> 16:10.903
Hey-hey!
Look who's up!

16:10.937 --> 16:13.640
Let me ask you a question.
If you were tarragon leaves,

16:13.673 --> 16:15.142
where would you be at?

16:22.182 --> 16:23.283
God bless 'em.

16:23.316 --> 16:26.586
Old white women love
their ice cream.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.523
Hello.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.427
I'm recently single.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.996
(whispers): And I
can't get pregnant.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.632
Oh, my God.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.770
What the hell are you doing?
Mingling.

16:43.803 --> 16:45.505
I'm single now.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.640
(whispers): And I
can't get pregnant.
Right.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.644
Oh, this music's awful!

16:51.678 --> 16:54.247
If I'm gonna meet someone, we
need something more romantic.

16:54.281 --> 16:56.183
Look, Mom, you took
a sleeping pill

16:56.216 --> 16:58.818
and you're acting kind of nutty,
so you need to go back to bed.

16:58.851 --> 16:59.819
Oh! Dirty Dancing!

16:59.852 --> 17:01.388
My favorite!

17:01.421 --> 17:03.223
Who wants to
dirty dance?

17:03.256 --> 17:05.292
Nobody!
(nervous chuckle)

17:05.325 --> 17:08.195
Look, Mom, you're
making a sure thing

17:08.228 --> 17:11.364
a very questionable
thing right now.

17:11.398 --> 17:12.499
I need a spoon.

17:12.532 --> 17:15.835
Spatula was a bad choice.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.605
I'll get you a spoon, and then
you're gonna go to bed, okay?

17:18.638 --> 17:20.173
One second. Sorry.

17:20.207 --> 17:23.376
Live-in housekeeper--
she's a bit of a handful.

17:31.684 --> 17:32.852
(remote clicks)

17:32.885 --> 17:35.422
(mechanical whirring)

17:38.791 --> 17:39.859
(chuckles):
Hey!

17:39.892 --> 17:43.730
I think your dad found
the lost remote for the bed.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.738
(crying)
What are you doing?

17:51.771 --> 17:54.674
No one wanted to
dance with me.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.743
I think I have
to get in shape.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.411
(sobbing)

17:58.445 --> 18:00.780
You're gonna
hurt yourself, Mom.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.149
You live with your mother?

18:02.182 --> 18:04.317
What? No, it's
a term of endearment.

18:05.652 --> 18:08.655
All I ever wanted was
someone I love to dance with

18:08.688 --> 18:10.890
like you and Janice did
at your wedding.

18:10.923 --> 18:15.228
I wasted 43 years of my life
with the wrong man.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.464
It's okay, Mom.
Starting over is hard.

18:17.497 --> 18:20.700
Trust me, I'm scared, too,
but we're gonna get through it.

18:20.733 --> 18:21.901
That's easy for you to say.

18:21.934 --> 18:25.905
You're young; you can still
find someone to dance with.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.307
My life is over.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.908
(groans)
No, it's not.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.577
Look, we're both
starting over

18:30.610 --> 18:32.912
in a world that we know
very little about.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.282
Don't give up.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.350
You're gonna get
to do that dance.

18:37.384 --> 18:39.719
With someone who
loves you, I promise.

18:39.752 --> 18:42.289
You're a good son.

18:42.322 --> 18:45.758
You're a liar,
but you're a good son.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.627
Enjoy your party.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.696
I'll stay out of your way.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.236
Mom?

18:58.738 --> 19:00.707
(rock music stops,
"The Time of My Life" playing)

19:00.740 --> 19:01.908
I'm not a liar.

19:01.941 --> 19:05.278
* Now, I've had

19:05.312 --> 19:07.614
* The time of my life

19:07.647 --> 19:11.551
* No, I never felt
like this before *

19:11.584 --> 19:13.820
* Yes, I swear

19:13.853 --> 19:15.855
* It's the truth

19:15.888 --> 19:19.626
This is either gonna be
very sweet or very creepy.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.828
* 'Cause I've

19:21.861 --> 19:26.333
* Had the time of my life...

19:26.366 --> 19:28.235
Creepy!

19:28.268 --> 19:30.537
*

19:35.442 --> 19:37.810
* I've been waiting
for so long *

19:37.844 --> 19:39.812
* Now I've finally
found someone *

19:39.846 --> 19:41.448
* To stand by me

19:44.251 --> 19:46.886
* We saw the writing
on the wall *

19:46.919 --> 19:51.591
* As we felt
this magical fantasy *

19:51.624 --> 19:53.326
Did you fart?

19:53.360 --> 19:55.595
Probably.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.802
(phone ringing)

20:06.906 --> 20:10.343
Nathan and his mother's house.

20:10.377 --> 20:13.946
Well, well, two times
in one morning-- what now?

20:13.980 --> 20:15.715
It's not the
remote this time.

20:15.748 --> 20:18.351
I can't figure out
their coffeemaker.

20:18.385 --> 20:20.387
What kind is it?

20:21.421 --> 20:22.789
It's a white one.

20:25.625 --> 20:28.795
Okay, you're gonna have to start
reading all the buttons to me.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.330
Let me find my glasses.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.332
The only reason
I'm helping you with this

20:32.365 --> 20:34.367
is so you'll learn
to live on your own.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.035
I know.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.637
Did you find them yet?

20:37.670 --> 20:39.306
No.

20:39.339 --> 20:41.341
Are they on your head?

20:46.713 --> 20:48.615
Nope.

20:48.648 --> 20:51.784
I, uh, think I left them
in the bathroom. Hold on.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.788
(stomping)

20:56.956 --> 20:59.292
Found them!

20:59.326 --> 21:00.960
(stomping)

21:02.429 --> 21:07.033
(phone auto-dialing)

21:07.066 --> 21:08.868
Long live the king.
