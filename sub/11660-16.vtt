(calm music playing)

00:58.433 --> 01:00.300
Why are you wearing black?

01:00.367 --> 01:01.834
Did you come from a funeral?

01:01.900 --> 01:05.200
No, Rose. We were singing backup
for Johnny Cash.

01:08.633 --> 01:10.266
Yes, we were at a funeral.

01:10.333 --> 01:11.533
Who died?

01:11.600 --> 01:13.633
My best friend, Edith Flannery.

01:13.700 --> 01:16.166
Isn't Mildred Feinberg
your best friend?

01:16.233 --> 01:18.033
We've grown apart.

01:18.100 --> 01:20.667
Her death had something to do
with it.

01:21.166 --> 01:23.567
I really thought Edith
would be around longer.

01:23.633 --> 01:26.100
She was only 88 years old
and in perfect health.

01:26.166 --> 01:27.333
Then one night, bingo!

01:27.400 --> 01:29.266
She closes her eyes and she's gone.

01:29.333 --> 01:30.633
She died in her sleep?

01:30.700 --> 01:33.033
Are you deaf?
I said she died playing bingo.

01:36.700 --> 01:40.200
Well, I guess Phyllis Gluckman
will be my new best friend.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.400
I thought you hated her.

01:42.467 --> 01:44.433
At the rate my friends are going,

01:44.500 --> 01:47.133
I won't have to spend
much time with her.

01:50.400 --> 01:53.800
I think Sophia's really been
shaken up by this.

01:53.867 --> 01:55.266
She's not the only one.

02:02.767 --> 02:04.467
Dorothy, what do you mean?

02:04.533 --> 02:06.033
Ma's 82 years old.

02:06.100 --> 02:08.200
Edith was only six years older.

02:08.266 --> 02:09.834
Guess what I'm thinking.

02:09.900 --> 02:13.934
You're thinking your time
with Sophia may be running short.

02:14.033 --> 02:18.233
Wow, Blanche, that's amazing!
Now guess what I'm thinking.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.934
I was talking to Edith's daughter.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.200
She flew in from San Francisco.

02:29.266 --> 02:33.834
She felt bad because she hadn't
seen her mother in over a year.

02:33.900 --> 02:37.133
It's hard to stay close
living that far away.

02:37.200 --> 02:43.066
I live with my mother, yet we spend
very little quality time together.

02:43.133 --> 02:44.900
Sometimes we'll be watching TV

02:44.967 --> 02:50.333
and I start wondering how many more
times I have left like that.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.967
I find myself staring at her

02:53.033 --> 02:57.133
like I'm trying to freeze her face
in my memory.

02:57.200 --> 03:01.400
Like I never want to forget
one single line or wrinkle...

03:01.900 --> 03:04.700
and suddenly she'll say,
"Why are you staring at me?

03:04.767 --> 03:07.633
I've been wanting to pick my nose
for the past half hour."

03:14.834 --> 03:17.800
I live by one simple rule,

03:17.867 --> 03:21.800
"Share your love with people today
'cause they may be gone tomorrow."

03:22.700 --> 03:24.266
That's a beautiful sentiment,
Blanche.

03:24.333 --> 03:26.934
Comes from dating
a lot of traveling salesmen.

03:30.767 --> 03:34.800
I heard a fable once
that might help.

03:34.867 --> 03:35.734
Can I tell you?

03:35.800 --> 03:38.100
That's right,
wait till my defenses are down

03:38.166 --> 03:40.533
and take advantage of me.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.166
Okey-dokey.

03:44.667 --> 03:49.500
Once upon a time, in the
magical land of Frafruvenhaven...

03:55.934 --> 04:00.100
lived Toonder the mediocre tiger.

04:00.166 --> 04:03.233
He was called mediocre because
there was nothing special about him.

04:03.300 --> 04:05.667
He wasn't talented,
he wasn't smart,

04:05.734 --> 04:07.934
he wasn't rich, he wasn't handsome.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.533
He wasn't good at anything.

04:09.600 --> 04:13.867
If he also wore a bad toupee,
she could be describing my Stanley.

04:16.367 --> 04:19.200
Toonder's wife was miserable

04:19.266 --> 04:21.900
that her husband was best known
for being mediocre--

04:21.967 --> 04:24.734
I understand Marilyn Quayle
feels the same way.

04:30.867 --> 04:33.500
So she asked her fairy godmother

04:33.567 --> 04:38.800
to grant Toonder the ability to
perform incredible feats of magic,

04:38.867 --> 04:40.600
and her wish was granted.

04:40.667 --> 04:45.133
Toonder the mediocre
became Toonder the magnificent!

04:45.200 --> 04:47.967
Guess he didn't want to change
the monograms on his towels, huh?

04:50.000 --> 04:53.600
Toonder the tiger spent
so much time performing

04:53.667 --> 04:56.633
that he didn't have
enough time for his wife.

04:56.700 --> 04:59.934
She told him she missed the time
they had together

05:00.000 --> 05:02.433
when he was just mediocre,

05:02.500 --> 05:06.734
so Toonder used his magic
only once more,

05:06.800 --> 05:10.700
and that was to make
his powers disappear.

05:10.767 --> 05:12.433
They lived happily ever after?

05:12.500 --> 05:14.700
No, actually,
she got bored and ran off

05:14.767 --> 05:19.433
with Weisblatt the Weasel,
Toonder's old business manager.

05:19.500 --> 05:22.133
-They lived happily ever after.
-What happened to Toonder?

05:22.200 --> 05:24.233
Oh, who cares, Blanche?

05:26.233 --> 05:29.700
Once you hear happily ever after,
it's over.

05:29.767 --> 05:32.567
Dorothy,
did you get anything out of this?

05:32.633 --> 05:34.867
Actually, I did get an idea.

05:34.934 --> 05:41.200
I'm going to take ma away
to a cabin in the Florida Keys

05:41.266 --> 05:43.500
where we can spend
some quality time together.

05:43.567 --> 05:46.033
You got that from her fable?

05:46.100 --> 05:49.967
No, I got it from this brochure
somebody left here.

05:50.033 --> 05:54.800
I wouldn't have read it if her
fable hadn't bored me to tears.

05:54.867 --> 05:55.767
Thank you.

05:55.834 --> 05:57.233
You're welcome.

05:59.300 --> 06:02.166
Ma, I have a surprise for you.

06:02.233 --> 06:05.266
-You got a date Saturday?
-Better.

06:05.333 --> 06:09.266
We're going away for the weekend,
just the two of us.

06:09.333 --> 06:13.100
We're off to a cabin in the Keys.

06:13.166 --> 06:14.133
Wait a minute, Dorothy.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.633
You pulled this one
on me once before.

06:16.700 --> 06:19.066
Remember Shady Pines
Retirement Village?

06:21.533 --> 06:23.667
She said we were going to a resort.

06:23.734 --> 06:27.066
We pull up to this place
that looks like the bates motel.

06:27.133 --> 06:29.600
Two goons drag me inside.

06:29.667 --> 06:32.734
For the next 18 months, I'm forced
to make lanyards against my will.

06:32.800 --> 06:35.600
That's not how it was.

06:35.667 --> 06:39.433
Right. Sometimes they forced me
to make moccasins.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.100
No, thanks. Not again.

06:41.166 --> 06:45.400
I just want us to go away together,
just the two of us.

06:45.467 --> 06:48.400
We'll go anywhere you want.

06:48.467 --> 06:51.567
-I want to go to Disney world.
-Ok.

06:51.633 --> 06:55.066
All of a sudden?
After I've been asking for years?

06:55.133 --> 06:57.433
That's right.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.533
Leave your shoe sizes.

06:58.600 --> 07:01.834
Let me know whether you want your
moccasins in brown or black.

07:03.300 --> 07:07.033
(mellow music playing)

07:07.533 --> 07:11.133
Oh, hello. This is Dorothy.

07:11.200 --> 07:16.734
I'd like to confirm my reservation
on flight 505 to Orlando. Uh-huh.

07:17.867 --> 07:20.734
Now, let's got over
the arrangements I made

07:20.800 --> 07:24.066
to have my mother taken away
at the departure gate.

07:26.934 --> 07:28.533
You don't know what
I'm talking about?

07:28.600 --> 07:30.200
Neither do I. Goodbye.

07:32.133 --> 07:35.133
-Hi, ma. You ready to go?
-You bet, pussycat.

07:35.200 --> 07:37.700
I'm glad you stopped
being so suspicious.

07:37.767 --> 07:38.934
Oh, please.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.166
If you can't trust family
who can you trust?

07:43.233 --> 07:44.633
(horn honks)

07:44.700 --> 07:46.133
There's our cab.

07:46.200 --> 07:50.467
Oh, girls, don't forget
to pick up a hat with ears.

07:50.533 --> 07:51.734
We won't forget, Rose.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.600
Oh, it's not for me,
it's for one of the girls

07:53.667 --> 07:54.967
in my Sunshine Cadet Troop.

07:55.033 --> 07:55.967
Yeah, we know, Rose.

07:56.033 --> 07:58.100
I'm too old for that silly stuff.

07:58.166 --> 07:59.800
But the girls love it.

07:59.867 --> 08:00.667
Right, Rose.

08:00.734 --> 08:03.033
You want "R-O-S-E"
sewn in the back?

08:03.100 --> 08:05.000
If it's not too much trouble.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.400
Space mountain, here I come.

08:09.467 --> 08:11.667
Ma, I told you, no scary rides.

08:11.734 --> 08:13.367
Then we better find another
way to the airport,

08:13.433 --> 08:15.266
the cabbie's wearing a turban.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.867
They are going to have
such a great time.

08:24.934 --> 08:26.600
What are you doing?

08:26.667 --> 08:28.800
Just doodling.
What do you think?

08:28.867 --> 08:32.533
Let's see.
Oh, it's a tiger!

08:32.600 --> 08:36.533
With multicolored stripes,
wearing a tuxedo,

08:36.600 --> 08:40.333
a top hat, and holding a magic wand.

08:40.400 --> 08:45.200
Oh, my gosh!
It's Toondor the magnificent tiger!

08:45.266 --> 08:46.100
Oh.

08:46.166 --> 08:49.400
I keep thinking about him.

08:49.467 --> 08:52.433
You know how it is when you can't
get something out of your head?

08:52.500 --> 08:55.133
Oh, yeah, water's the worst.

08:58.900 --> 09:02.133
That's why I always wear earplugs
when I shampoo.

09:03.266 --> 09:05.734
I was talking about your fable.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.934
Listen, I have an idea.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.033
With your stories
and my illustrations,

09:10.100 --> 09:11.967
we might have a best seller.

09:12.033 --> 09:16.266
What do you say to us teaming up
and writing a kid's storybook?

09:16.333 --> 09:19.367
Blanche, that's a terrific idea!

09:19.433 --> 09:23.700
When my children were small,
I always bought those storybooks.

09:23.767 --> 09:25.467
I'll bet they loved them.

09:25.533 --> 09:28.033
Naw, they had their own books.

09:31.266 --> 09:33.767
(serene music playing)

09:35.734 --> 09:39.900
Ma, you've been in there for
20 minutes. What are you doing?

09:41.266 --> 09:42.934
Painting a fresco on the ceiling.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.734
It's a bathroom,
what do you think I'm doing?

09:48.567 --> 09:51.100
-What are you writing?
-Nothing.

09:51.166 --> 09:52.834
What do you mean?
What is that?

09:52.900 --> 09:55.367
Well, Ma, you have such
a great sense of humor,

09:55.433 --> 09:57.867
and I can never remember
all the funny things you say,

09:57.934 --> 10:00.133
so I've decided to keep a journal.

10:00.200 --> 10:03.867
A journal? Who the hell
are you, Bill Moyers?

10:03.934 --> 10:08.467
That is classic. "Bill Moyers."

10:08.533 --> 10:10.433
Fine, come on, Dorothy,
I'll give you great stuff

10:10.500 --> 10:11.667
while on space mountain.

10:11.734 --> 10:13.700
Not so fast, Ma,
I have a surprise for you.

10:13.767 --> 10:14.600
What is it?

10:14.667 --> 10:19.266
Remember all those photos
we kept in pop's old cigar boxes?

10:19.333 --> 10:22.100
I've organized them
into these albums.

10:22.166 --> 10:24.233
Ma, they're for you.
They're for us.

10:24.300 --> 10:27.000
They're for later, let's go.

10:27.066 --> 10:30.367
Come on, Ma, the park can wait.
Let's do this now.

10:30.433 --> 10:33.066
Okay. Let's make it quick.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.033
Oh, Ma. Look.

10:35.100 --> 10:38.934
Here's you holding me
when I was a baby.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.500
Do you remember
what you were thinking then?

10:41.567 --> 10:42.700
Oh, yeah.

10:42.767 --> 10:46.600
Summer 1932. I was thinking,

10:46.667 --> 10:49.600
"Boy, am I blessed to have such
a precious baby in my life."

10:49.667 --> 10:51.333
Oh, Ma. That's beautiful.

10:51.400 --> 10:54.033
Things are going just great.

10:54.100 --> 10:57.600
Look, you're holding
my hand while I'm skating.

10:57.667 --> 10:59.033
What were you thinking then?

10:59.100 --> 11:02.600
Winter 1934. I was thinking,

11:02.667 --> 11:05.967
"Boy, am I blessed to have such
a precious 2-year-old in my life."

11:06.033 --> 11:07.900
Oh, look!

11:08.000 --> 11:11.100
Here's one of us on
a bicycle built for two.

11:11.166 --> 11:14.066
Spring 1940. I was thinking,
"Boy, am I--"

11:14.133 --> 11:16.200
Ma, you're making this up!

11:19.133 --> 11:20.200
Of course, I am.

11:20.266 --> 11:23.133
How the hell should I remember
what I was thinking back then?

11:25.600 --> 11:27.867
I still look for Ed Sullivan
on Sunday nights.

11:29.934 --> 11:34.133
The scary part is
sometimes I find him.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.166
Why can't you make me happy?

11:36.233 --> 11:37.934
I want to do this.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.500
If a trip down memory lane
will make you happy,

11:42.567 --> 11:44.400
I'm willing to take a stroll.

11:44.467 --> 11:46.233
I'll tell you what we'll do.

11:46.300 --> 11:49.400
We'll order dinner in,
finish looking at the photos,

11:49.467 --> 11:54.000
then we can reread
these old letters.

11:54.500 --> 11:57.266
Too bad you didn't
bring along the slides.

11:57.333 --> 12:00.967
Ma, now you've got the spirit.

12:04.166 --> 12:06.233
(calm music playing)

12:06.300 --> 12:07.533
I just finished a sketch

12:07.600 --> 12:10.200
of Toonder's pals,
the Dinkelheimer twins.

12:10.266 --> 12:13.734
This book is really coming along.

12:13.800 --> 12:17.100
You can chalk it all
up to synergism.

12:17.166 --> 12:18.900
Yeah, synergism.

12:18.967 --> 12:21.533
What would we ever do without it?

12:21.600 --> 12:23.700
Good old synergism.

12:23.767 --> 12:27.000
You have no idea
what it means, do you?

12:27.066 --> 12:29.567
Not a clue.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.734
Synergism is the powerful energy

12:32.800 --> 12:36.333
that is generated by two people
engaged in the same activity.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.133
Up till now,
I had no idea it could occur

12:39.200 --> 12:42.000
outside a Howard Johnson's
motor lodge.

12:42.066 --> 12:43.800
(both laughing)

12:50.100 --> 12:53.800
You still have no idea
what I'm talking about, do you?

12:55.533 --> 12:56.667
Nope.

12:58.333 --> 13:01.734
Oh, but I enjoy working with you.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.000
Me, too. You know why?

13:03.066 --> 13:06.633
Because we're not just partners,
we're good friends.

13:06.700 --> 13:08.533
I feel like I could say anything
to you.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.266
Of course, you can.

13:10.333 --> 13:13.033
-Even criticize your artwork.
-Well, of course.

13:13.100 --> 13:18.066
The point of collaborating
is to get beyond our egos.

13:18.133 --> 13:18.834
What do you think?

13:18.900 --> 13:20.900
This needs a few changes.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.533
Drop dead.

13:23.934 --> 13:26.567
Whatever happened
to getting beyond your ego?

13:26.633 --> 13:28.700
My ego isn't involved here.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.533
These drawings are brilliant.

13:30.600 --> 13:33.200
I've lived
with these characters all my life.

13:33.266 --> 13:35.633
I'll determine if they're brilliant.

13:35.700 --> 13:37.233
That one needs work.

13:37.300 --> 13:38.567
What's wrong with it?

13:38.633 --> 13:42.000
You forgot Melvin the Loneliest
sea otter's little beanie

13:42.066 --> 13:44.100
with the propeller on top.

13:44.166 --> 13:46.333
No, I didn't. It blew away.

13:47.767 --> 13:49.333
It did not.

13:49.400 --> 13:52.100
Big wind came along,
blew it right off his head.

13:52.166 --> 13:53.633
That couldn't have happened.

13:53.700 --> 13:56.467
That's what you're going to write.

13:56.533 --> 13:58.133
What if I refuse?

13:59.533 --> 14:00.900
You see this eraser?

14:02.934 --> 14:06.033
I'm going to rub out Melvin's little
friend, Mookie the Sailor.

14:07.900 --> 14:09.133
You wouldn't.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.233
Try me.

14:11.300 --> 14:14.867
No, please, Blanche.
I'll do anything you say.

14:14.934 --> 14:17.100
Thought you'd see it my way.

14:20.533 --> 14:23.700
Pop was a lousy photographer.
Who is that?

14:23.767 --> 14:24.967
Uncle Vittorio.

14:25.033 --> 14:26.867
His head's cut off.
How can you tell?

14:26.934 --> 14:29.166
That's exactly how
he looked in the morgue

14:29.233 --> 14:32.033
after he turned state's evidence
against Benny the blade.

14:34.700 --> 14:39.467
Oh, Ma, this is so special,
spending this time together.

14:39.533 --> 14:41.667
Yeah, right.

14:41.734 --> 14:44.867
I think we're missing
a box of slides.

14:44.934 --> 14:47.633
They must be in the suitcase.

14:47.700 --> 14:49.200
I'll take a look.

14:55.967 --> 14:57.200
Where are you going?

14:57.266 --> 15:01.500
Your life's supposed to flash
before your eyes when you die,

15:01.567 --> 15:03.633
not when you're on vacation.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.934
I've waited my whole life
to ride space mountain.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.100
Nothing's going to stop me.

15:09.166 --> 15:11.567
(thunder)

15:13.600 --> 15:15.734
Why are you always taking her side?

15:18.400 --> 15:20.433
(mellow music playing)

15:23.533 --> 15:25.700
(soft music playing)

15:26.800 --> 15:31.333
Who would have thought it would rain
for 24 hours straight?

15:31.400 --> 15:33.734
Red 6s.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.834
Does this look like solitaire?
It's your turn.

15:49.900 --> 15:55.000
Sorry. I was trying to remember
the last time I said I love you.

15:55.066 --> 15:58.767
After lunch, when I said
you had cheese on your chin.

15:59.266 --> 16:01.266
Make your move, for God's sake.

16:01.333 --> 16:03.967
You're making this difficult for me.

16:04.033 --> 16:07.467
I'm not great at dealing
with emotions.

16:07.533 --> 16:10.900
Whenever someone starts
talking about their deepest feelings

16:10.967 --> 16:15.166
I usually get uncomfortable
and tune out, I don't know why.

16:15.233 --> 16:17.233
Where do you think
it comes from, Ma?

16:17.300 --> 16:21.133
Huh? Sorry, Dorothy.
My corn pad slipped.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.867
You were saying?

16:23.800 --> 16:25.200
Never mind.

16:25.266 --> 16:27.300
You think the rain will ever let up?

16:27.367 --> 16:29.734
I honestly don't care.

16:29.800 --> 16:32.066
Who needs outside distractions?

16:32.133 --> 16:35.300
What we have here is more important.

16:35.367 --> 16:38.433
What we have here
is getting on my nerves.

16:38.500 --> 16:39.600
Where are you going?

16:39.667 --> 16:43.500
Someplace where there are
no walks down memory lane.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.000
-I'll come with you.
-What are we, nuns?

16:45.066 --> 16:48.066
We don't have to travel in pairs.
I'm out of here.

16:48.133 --> 16:49.800
(serene music playing)

16:49.867 --> 16:51.467
(door shuts)

16:53.867 --> 16:55.767
(piano playing)

16:58.200 --> 17:00.734
Hey, Sam,
what's that you're playing?

17:00.800 --> 17:02.600
Oh, just a little something.

17:02.667 --> 17:04.967
Stop it. You know
what I want to hear.

17:05.033 --> 17:06.934
No, I don't.

17:07.967 --> 17:10.734
You played it for her.
Play it for me.

17:10.800 --> 17:14.400
If she can stand it, so can I.
Now play.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.367
Ok. You're the boss.

17:17.433 --> 17:22.000
<i>♪ It's a world of laughter ♪</i>

17:22.066 --> 17:25.867
<i>♪ It's a world of tears ♪</i>

17:25.934 --> 17:29.600
<i>♪ It's a world of hopes ♪</i>

17:29.667 --> 17:33.734
<i>♪ And a world of fears ♪</i>

17:33.800 --> 17:37.500
<i>♪ There's so much that we share ♪</i>

17:37.567 --> 17:41.800
<i>♪ That it's time we're aware ♪</i>

17:41.867 --> 17:48.100
<i>♪ It's a small world after all ♪</i>

17:49.800 --> 17:51.200
Ma.

17:52.467 --> 17:54.767
Of all the saloons and gin joints
in the world,

17:54.834 --> 17:56.500
she had to walk into mine.

17:57.900 --> 18:01.300
I've been looking everywhere
for you. We need to talk.

18:04.166 --> 18:07.700
Why you trying so hard
to ruin my weekend?

18:07.767 --> 18:09.266
You don't get it.

18:09.333 --> 18:11.133
This weekend could have been fun

18:11.200 --> 18:13.767
until you decided
to have quality time.

18:13.834 --> 18:18.767
All I wanted to do was have us
finish unfinished business

18:18.834 --> 18:22.266
and say things to each other
that we never said before.

18:22.333 --> 18:24.633
Dorothy, this isn't
<i>On Golden Pond.</i>

18:24.700 --> 18:27.166
-I know.
-You're not Jane Fonda.

18:27.233 --> 18:30.166
All right!
You've made your point.

18:30.233 --> 18:31.867
Quality time has
to come naturally.

18:31.934 --> 18:33.867
It happens when you're not
thinking about it,

18:33.934 --> 18:36.767
like when we're cutting vegetables.

18:36.834 --> 18:40.300
I was hoping for something
a little more magical.

18:40.367 --> 18:42.200
Let me tell you a story.

18:42.266 --> 18:46.633
When I was a kid in Sicily,
I loved lightning bugs.

18:46.700 --> 18:50.066
I'd watch them light up
the night sky.

18:50.133 --> 18:54.066
That was magical.
That was spectacular.

18:54.133 --> 18:59.600
I tell you,
I saw a thousand points of light.

18:59.667 --> 19:02.800
It was a kinder, gentler America.

19:02.867 --> 19:04.333
I turned to my wife Barbara--

19:04.400 --> 19:07.867
Ma, what the hell
are you talking about?

19:07.934 --> 19:12.000
Sorry, I must have lapsed into
George Bush's inauguration speech.

19:12.066 --> 19:13.400
Where was I?

19:13.467 --> 19:15.667
-Lightning bugs.
-Right.

19:15.734 --> 19:18.300
I'd catch them in glass jars

19:18.367 --> 19:22.433
so I could always watch them
light up, but they always died.

19:22.500 --> 19:25.767
I see what you mean.
They needed their freedom.

19:25.834 --> 19:28.934
No, they needed air. I always
forgot to punch holes in the lid.

19:30.333 --> 19:33.367
It's the same
with all magical moments.

19:33.433 --> 19:37.667
You can't capture them forever,
no matter what kodak tells you.

19:39.133 --> 19:43.433
So, what you're saying is that,
like a lightning bug,

19:43.500 --> 19:47.834
I put you in a glass jar and,
waiting for you to light up,

19:47.900 --> 19:50.300
I nearly suffocated you.

19:50.367 --> 19:54.033
Jeez, Dorothy, you sure know
how to beat a metaphor to death.

19:56.767 --> 19:59.500
-Ma, I love you.
-I love you too.

19:59.567 --> 20:02.533
Promise you'll never
make me do this again.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.800
Ok, only if you promise
you'll live forever.

20:05.867 --> 20:08.166
Ok, I promise.

20:08.233 --> 20:10.166
How can you make
a promise like that?

20:10.233 --> 20:12.800
If I don't come through,
what can you do to me?

20:16.934 --> 20:20.667
(calm music playing)

20:21.166 --> 20:24.900
-Blanche.
-Rose, I owe you an apology.

20:24.967 --> 20:28.600
I may have said
things I didn't mean.

20:28.667 --> 20:30.266
Like calling me a dummy?

20:30.333 --> 20:31.600
No.

20:33.767 --> 20:37.600
Anyway, the important thing
is to finish our book.

20:37.667 --> 20:40.667
-There isn't any book.
-What are you saying?

20:40.734 --> 20:43.700
Did I just lapse into Swedish?

20:44.200 --> 20:46.700
Read it and weep.

20:46.767 --> 20:49.033
<i>"Tales of Toonder</i>
<i>the tiger and his friends,</i>

20:49.100 --> 20:53.533
by Hans Christian Lockerheuven."

20:53.600 --> 20:56.734
Well,
who's Hans Christian Lockerheuven?

20:56.800 --> 20:59.533
Only St. Olaf's greatest author.

20:59.600 --> 21:03.100
He wrote the classic fairy tale,
<i>Hansel and Hansel.</i>

21:08.066 --> 21:11.133
You told me your parents made
up these stories.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.767
I thought they did.

21:12.834 --> 21:14.867
When I called my sister
for more stories,

21:14.934 --> 21:18.033
she suggested I pick up the book.

21:18.100 --> 21:21.934
Great. We're writing stories
that have already been written.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.200
If it's any consolation, they do it
all the time on <i>Mr. Belvedere.</i>

21:28.533 --> 21:30.700
My dream is crushed.

21:30.767 --> 21:32.667
I always wanted to
be rich and famous.

21:32.734 --> 21:34.734
Now it won't happen.

21:34.800 --> 21:37.367
This poem might help.

21:37.433 --> 21:40.400
It goes, "Never, ever
give up your dreams,

21:40.467 --> 21:42.400
even when they're doused in sorrow.

21:42.467 --> 21:44.700
Because even though
they seem far away,

21:44.767 --> 21:47.967
they could come true tomorrow."

21:48.033 --> 21:50.233
I wrote that, Blanche.

21:50.300 --> 21:52.734
You know, it isn't half bad.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.500
It's better than a lot
on greeting cards.

21:55.567 --> 21:57.133
Oh, I have hundreds.

21:57.633 --> 21:59.300
You know what I'm thinking?

21:59.367 --> 22:02.500
That with your drawings
and my poems,

22:02.567 --> 22:05.600
we might go into
the greeting card business?

22:05.667 --> 22:09.700
No, I'm thinking about
a place at the beach

22:09.767 --> 22:12.500
where the waves break so hard,

22:12.567 --> 22:14.734
they knock the bathing
suits right off the men

22:14.800 --> 22:16.800
coming out of the water.

22:18.633 --> 22:21.400
Maybe we can salvage
the rest of this day.

22:21.467 --> 22:23.667
Come on, let's go.

22:23.734 --> 22:26.367
(mellow music playing)

22:56.900 --> 22:58.700
How's the packing going?

22:58.767 --> 23:01.033
Better if I had a screwdriver.

23:02.166 --> 23:05.266
I just bought postcards
to remember the trip.

23:05.333 --> 23:07.300
I don't need postcards, pussycat.

23:07.367 --> 23:10.567
I'll remember this trip
for a long time.

23:10.633 --> 23:14.500
Oh, just our luck.
The rain stops when we're leaving.

23:14.567 --> 23:16.400
We have a little time.

23:16.467 --> 23:18.800
There's one more thing
I want to show you

23:18.867 --> 23:21.633
to make this terrific
weekend complete.

23:21.700 --> 23:23.200
Oh, no, Dorothy.

23:23.266 --> 23:27.100
We looked at pictures
and slides and letters

23:27.166 --> 23:29.266
and diaries and locks of hair.

23:29.333 --> 23:33.467
What's left, our family history
in shadow puppets?

23:33.533 --> 23:35.300
Ma, better!

23:35.367 --> 23:38.800
(Sophia) Now this is what
I call quality time!

23:38.867 --> 23:42.834
(both screaming)

23:44.633 --> 23:47.767
(theme music playing)
