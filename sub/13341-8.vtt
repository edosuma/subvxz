WEBVTT

01:07.000 --> 01:08.792
Are you sure I can't
get you anything else?

01:08.792 --> 01:11.750
Oh, yeah, no.
I'm actually waiting
for someone.

01:11.750 --> 01:13.792
I'm actually waiting
for Patti LuPone.

01:13.792 --> 01:16.250
I have-- I'm going to conduct
an interview with her.

01:16.250 --> 01:18.250
If you could
just let her know
that I'm sitting right here,

01:18.250 --> 01:19.917
that would be amazing.

01:19.917 --> 01:22.041
I don't know
what she looks like.

01:22.041 --> 01:23.542
Patti LuPone?

01:23.542 --> 01:27.125
Like, ♪ Don't cry
for me, Argen-- ♪
that's not--

01:29.500 --> 01:32.959
- Okay.
- ( ringtone playing )

01:32.959 --> 01:35.583
Hi, mister.
I'm waiting for Patti.

01:35.583 --> 01:37.542
I'm at my callback.

01:37.542 --> 01:39.750
Oh, my God.
"Major Barbara."
Are you excited?

01:39.750 --> 01:41.166
I don't know.
It's a small part.

01:41.166 --> 01:43.959
No, there's no small parts,
there's only small actors,

01:43.959 --> 01:45.250
and you're
a very tall actor.

01:45.250 --> 01:47.583
Everyone here looks
like how I'd look
with a nose job.

01:47.583 --> 01:49.542
But they don't want
someone with a nose job.

01:49.542 --> 01:51.166
They want someone
with a spirit.

01:51.166 --> 01:52.792
Whatever.
I'm not here
to make friends.

01:52.792 --> 01:57.125
Look, they don't love it
when you're on the phone.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.667
Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, okay.

02:00.667 --> 02:03.000
- I've gotta go.
- Okay, I love you.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.583
- I love you too.
- Bye.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.333
I'll call you
after the interview.
Bye.

02:06.333 --> 02:09.250
I'm sorry. I'm just--
I know this casting director.

02:09.250 --> 02:11.458
She's kinda,
like, proper.

02:11.458 --> 02:13.708
No, no, no, no,
it's cool.
Thank you.

02:13.708 --> 02:16.041
Yeah, sure.

02:16.041 --> 02:19.208
- Ahem, Desi.
- Adam.

02:19.208 --> 02:21.542
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

02:27.417 --> 02:29.166
What part
are you reading?

02:30.417 --> 02:31.917
Bill.

02:31.917 --> 02:33.458
Oh, okay.

02:33.458 --> 02:35.542
- You?
- Uh, Bronterre.

02:35.542 --> 02:36.917
Oh.

02:36.917 --> 02:39.291
- Nice. Very nice.
- Yeah.

03:13.041 --> 03:15.917
Hi, Rocco.
Do you need me to sign?

03:15.917 --> 03:17.291
Nope,
have a great day.

03:17.291 --> 03:20.083
- Please don't go, Rocco.
- I have to go.

03:20.083 --> 03:22.542
I want to hear about
your weekend, Rocco.

03:22.542 --> 03:24.083
What did you have
for dinner?

03:24.083 --> 03:27.417
Who's your ex-wife?
Rocco, I'm so bored!

03:27.417 --> 03:29.917
You bastard.

03:34.834 --> 03:36.583
( chimes )

03:43.834 --> 03:45.583
So...

03:45.583 --> 03:47.667
Um, something's
actually come up

03:47.667 --> 03:49.834
for Patti
in her schedule,

03:49.834 --> 03:52.959
so she's not gonna--

03:52.959 --> 03:55.125
we're gonna reschedule.

04:03.333 --> 04:04.708
Adam?

04:04.708 --> 04:07.708
Can we see you
for one more second?

04:07.708 --> 04:09.375
Yeah.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.708
I said get two chickens.

04:12.708 --> 04:15.291
Whoops, they're back.
Okay, bye.

04:16.291 --> 04:18.083
Come on in.

04:23.750 --> 04:26.166
Do you guys want me
to give a different read?

04:26.166 --> 04:29.500
Congratulations.
You got it.

04:30.875 --> 04:34.125
- ( both laugh )
- Okay.

04:34.125 --> 04:36.500
Uh...

04:36.500 --> 04:38.500
- does he know?
- ( both laugh )

04:38.500 --> 04:42.333
- He does.
- ( laughs ) Okay.

04:42.333 --> 04:44.083
Okay, cool.

04:44.083 --> 04:47.125
Thank you very much.
( laughs )

04:57.208 --> 05:00.041
( muffled screaming )

05:02.875 --> 05:06.667
( muffled screaming )

05:14.375 --> 05:16.542
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:19.041 --> 05:21.417
- I got it.
- Yeah, me, too.

05:21.417 --> 05:23.125
Yeah, I know.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.375
Where are you headed?

05:27.375 --> 05:30.375
Uh, Greenpoint.

05:30.375 --> 05:32.000
You want a ride?

05:33.375 --> 05:35.750
No, I was thinking
of walking, actually.

05:36.542 --> 05:37.959
That's a long way.

05:37.959 --> 05:40.083
Yeah, that's far.
I'll take a ride.

05:52.417 --> 05:56.750
( music playing )

05:56.750 --> 05:59.417
No, Sam, you gotta hit
the keyboard harder

05:59.417 --> 06:00.792
throughout
this entire song.

06:00.792 --> 06:03.583
You just can't diddle
around the keyboard.

06:03.583 --> 06:06.000
That's why
you're having trouble
with your girlfriend.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.417
- I don't know what girl
likes to be--
- Ms. LuPone?

06:08.417 --> 06:11.500
- Yes?
- Hi, I'm Hannah Horvath.

06:11.500 --> 06:14.792
I'm here from Condé Nast
to do your Strenova interview.

06:14.792 --> 06:16.250
Yeah, I cancelled that.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.291
Nope, I know
you cancelled it...

06:18.291 --> 06:20.917
just five minutes before
we were supposed to do it,

06:20.917 --> 06:23.125
but my boss said that
we need to have it in today,

06:23.125 --> 06:26.834
so I called your publicist
and she mentioned
you were here.

06:26.834 --> 06:28.708
How long
is it gonna take?

06:28.708 --> 06:30.291
- Five minutes.
- Really?

06:30.291 --> 06:32.291
I would say
15 minutes maximum.

06:32.291 --> 06:35.417
Five to 15 minutes,
and then probably 10 minutes
just to wrap up.

06:35.417 --> 06:37.625
- Five minutes.
- Great.

06:37.625 --> 06:39.041
I don't know
if they explained to you,

06:39.041 --> 06:41.750
but this is gonna run
in the magazine just like
a normal article.

06:41.750 --> 06:43.959
Normal interview
with you, picture,

06:43.959 --> 06:47.125
byline, my name, everything,
and then at the bottom,

06:47.125 --> 06:48.667
it's just gonna say
"Sponsored by Strenova."

06:48.667 --> 06:50.792
Right, and I have
to mention Strenova, right?

06:50.792 --> 06:52.291
I have to mention
the bone density drug.

06:52.291 --> 06:54.458
- Yeah, I know it's
a little unnatural...
- Okay, all right.

06:54.458 --> 06:55.834
...but we'll just find
a way to work it in.

06:55.834 --> 06:57.792
- Okay.
- So, I'm gonna start with
some background questions.

06:57.792 --> 07:01.166
- Perfect.
- How long have you
had osteoporosis?

07:01.166 --> 07:04.417
I don't have
osteoporosis.

07:04.417 --> 07:07.000
Okay, well, Strenova's
a bone density drug.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.792
Oh, right.
Oh, I can't say that.

07:09.792 --> 07:12.417
Yeah, I think we should
just find an amount of time

07:12.417 --> 07:13.792
you're comfortable
with to say--

07:13.792 --> 07:15.917
- Five years.
- Okay, five years.

07:15.917 --> 07:17.750
- Does that make me
sound ancient?
- Not at all.

07:17.750 --> 07:21.083
I think it honestly sounds
like you were an early
victim of osteoporosis

07:21.083 --> 07:22.834
and you started
treating it soon enough

07:22.834 --> 07:24.291
that you're never
gonna have a hunchback.

07:24.291 --> 07:25.625
But can you be
an early victim of--

07:25.625 --> 07:26.917
I don't know
anything about it.

07:26.917 --> 07:28.959
- You can be an early victim
of Alzheimer's...
- Right.

07:28.959 --> 07:30.750
...so I don't understand
why osteoporosis would
be a problem.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.166
No, you're right.

07:32.166 --> 07:34.291
We're just gonna say
that you found it in
a routine bone scan

07:34.291 --> 07:37.041
after a hairline fracture
in your ankle.

07:37.041 --> 07:38.834
Okay, how did
I fracture my ankle?

07:38.834 --> 07:42.500
What's your favorite form
of physical exercise?

07:42.500 --> 07:44.208
Sleeping.

07:44.208 --> 07:46.959
Literally no one could relate
to that better than me.

07:46.959 --> 07:49.583
I'm the laziest person
I've ever met.

07:49.583 --> 07:51.708
Sometimes I just use
my chest as a tray,

07:51.708 --> 07:53.542
but the thing is
is that I really think

07:53.542 --> 07:54.875
they just wanna
get a sense of, like,

07:54.875 --> 07:56.542
all the different ways
you take care of yourself,

07:56.542 --> 07:58.083
and Strenova's
just one of them.

07:58.083 --> 08:01.959
- Say I walk my dog.
- Okay, dog.

08:01.959 --> 08:04.125
And his name?

08:04.125 --> 08:07.000
- Pippin.
- Pippin the dog.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.291
- Pippin the dog.
- Uh, what is his breed?

08:13.375 --> 08:15.583
Bulldog--
French Bulldog.

08:15.583 --> 08:17.500
- They're cute.
They're really cute.
- I'll remember that.

08:17.500 --> 08:20.708
- I don't need
to write that down.
- ( ringtone playing )

08:20.708 --> 08:22.125
I'm sorry, I have
to take this call,

08:22.125 --> 08:23.750
- which is very rude.
- Okay.

08:23.750 --> 08:25.917
Hello?

08:25.917 --> 08:27.792
Baby.

08:27.792 --> 08:29.583
How was it?

08:30.583 --> 08:32.457
No.

08:32.457 --> 08:33.958
No.

08:33.958 --> 08:35.417
Are you serious?

08:35.417 --> 08:36.625
Oh, my God.

08:36.625 --> 08:38.291
Okay, I'm with
Patti LuPone right now.

08:38.291 --> 08:42.207
She's only given me
seven minutes so--
okay, bye.

08:44.082 --> 08:45.333
I'm so sorry.

08:45.333 --> 08:47.166
That was my boyfriend,
and he just got cast

08:47.166 --> 08:49.375
in the revival of
"Major Barbara" on Broadway.

08:49.375 --> 08:53.083
Wow, wow.
His first Broadway role.

08:53.083 --> 08:54.417
Whoo.
( clicks tongue )

08:54.417 --> 08:55.542
What?

08:55.542 --> 08:58.083
Well, good luck,
'cause I'll tell you what.

08:58.083 --> 09:01.417
He's going to need you
to support him

09:01.417 --> 09:03.583
and forgive him

09:03.583 --> 09:06.208
'cause he's gonna
be an asshole.

09:06.208 --> 09:09.458
( music playing )

09:11.250 --> 09:13.542
Hey, bitch, you're taking
all the mochi.

09:13.542 --> 09:15.458
Oh, my God.
Soo Jin.

09:15.458 --> 09:16.875
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:16.875 --> 09:18.250
Hey.

09:18.250 --> 09:20.792
It's been
a really long time.

09:20.792 --> 09:22.333
I know, we're grannies.

09:22.333 --> 09:24.208
It's gross.

09:24.208 --> 09:26.083
Marnie: Well,
you look gorgeous.

09:26.083 --> 09:27.708
You, too,
as always, lades.

09:27.708 --> 09:29.250
Are you still
with Booth, or--

09:29.250 --> 09:30.625
Oh, no, no.
I mean, he wasn't, like--

09:30.625 --> 09:31.959
Yeah, he's a wiener
in a half shell.

09:31.959 --> 09:35.083
I'm so glad I quit.
The money was shit anyways.

09:35.083 --> 09:37.125
How about you?
What are you up to now?

09:37.125 --> 09:38.917
Well, I finally said,
"Fuck it,"

09:38.917 --> 09:40.458
and, as of next week,

09:40.458 --> 09:45.208
I, like, seriously DGAF,
don't give a fuck!

09:45.208 --> 09:47.583
I'm opening
my own gallery.

09:47.583 --> 09:49.000
Are you serious?

09:49.000 --> 09:50.625
It's been such
a fucking whirlwind.

09:50.625 --> 09:52.875
Literally don't have
time to breathe,

09:52.875 --> 09:54.291
and I'm dirt-poor now.

09:54.291 --> 09:56.583
- It's so sad.
- Well, you went shopping.

09:56.583 --> 09:58.166
Oh, no, this is
just a tax write-off.

09:58.166 --> 10:01.291
All my money has been
going to the space
and the publicity,

10:01.291 --> 10:02.959
and my parents
are ready to murder me,

10:02.959 --> 10:07.083
but it's just so freeing
to be your own boss,
you know?

10:07.083 --> 10:08.583
I have my own architect.

10:08.583 --> 10:10.667
I'm like,
"Where did my youth go?"

10:10.667 --> 10:12.208
I'm sure.

10:12.208 --> 10:13.792
Hey, do you have
someone helping you?

10:13.792 --> 10:16.000
Because opening
an art gallery's,
like, really hard.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.291
It's a lot harder
than anyone thinks,

10:17.291 --> 10:19.250
and I feel like
I see galleries
opening and closing

10:19.250 --> 10:20.333
every single day
in Bushwick.

10:20.333 --> 10:23.625
Oh, no, mine's in NoHo.
Hey, you know what?

10:23.625 --> 10:26.000
You should totally
stop by sometime.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.708
I'm really excited
for our first show.

10:27.708 --> 10:29.834
It's gonna be
super fresh, funky-funny.

10:29.834 --> 10:34.083
Sounds-- yeah,
maybe I will.

10:34.083 --> 10:35.041
Bye.

10:35.041 --> 10:37.583
- I'm really proud of you.
- Thank you.

10:37.583 --> 10:39.708
Really proud.
I just wanted
you to know that.

10:39.708 --> 10:41.333
Thanks.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.542
He's not gonna
even know you exist.

10:46.542 --> 10:48.000
Not until the show's open,
not until he's--

10:48.000 --> 10:50.834
if it runs, you know,
it runs for, like, maybe
three or four months,

10:50.834 --> 10:52.917
then he's gonna come back
down to earth, maybe.

10:52.917 --> 10:54.250
But is he mature?

10:54.250 --> 10:55.417
I'd say in some ways,

10:55.417 --> 10:56.875
he's the most mature
person I've ever met,

10:56.875 --> 11:00.041
and in other ways,
he has not yet been born.

11:00.041 --> 11:01.875
What are you involved
with him for?

11:01.875 --> 11:04.834
Does he even
understand Shaw?

11:04.834 --> 11:05.959
I-- I understand Shaw.

11:05.959 --> 11:07.750
- You do?
- Yeah.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.583
I did a Shaw once.
I don't know what the fuck
I was talking about.

11:09.583 --> 11:10.625
Because I'll tell you what.

11:10.625 --> 11:12.959
You get inside
of a production--

11:12.959 --> 11:15.125
you get inside of a play
with a group of actors,

11:15.125 --> 11:17.083
and they have to be intimate,
they have to know each other,

11:17.083 --> 11:20.792
because they've had
relationships, you know,
in the play for maybe years,

11:20.792 --> 11:23.792
so there has
to be an intimacy
that's created overnight,

11:23.792 --> 11:25.125
and then things happen.

11:25.125 --> 11:28.625
Your boyfriend,
if he is sexual in any way,

11:28.625 --> 11:30.750
is gonna start fucking
everybody in the building.

11:30.750 --> 11:32.834
And, don't forget,
he's gonna have fans.

11:32.834 --> 11:34.333
I don't think
he's gonna have fans.

11:34.333 --> 11:36.375
Honestly, he--
can I call you Patti?

11:36.375 --> 11:38.542
He is so funny-looking.

11:38.542 --> 11:41.375
There's a lot of weirdos
out there, honey.

11:41.375 --> 11:45.708
You know,
the Elephant Man
got laid a lot.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.875
- "Blue Crush" was such
an important movie for women.
- Oh, so important.

11:52.875 --> 11:54.750
And for surfers
in general, you know?

11:54.750 --> 11:56.500
"I'm gonna
surf a pipe, dude."

11:56.500 --> 11:58.667
Hannah, do you have
that Patti LuPone copy
I asked for?

11:58.667 --> 12:01.625
Oh, yes,
I'm just transcribing it
right now, actually.

12:01.625 --> 12:03.125
Well, not right this minute.

12:03.125 --> 12:06.875
I will have it for you
in 50 to 20 minutes.

12:06.875 --> 12:08.542
Great, listen.
Also, we have something

12:08.542 --> 12:09.875
going on with
the Gramercy Park Hotel.

12:09.875 --> 12:11.917
"16 reasons we'd love
to stay at the Gramercy."

12:11.917 --> 12:13.625
I think you'd
be great for it.

12:13.625 --> 12:15.375
Oh, amazing.
Definitely.

12:15.375 --> 12:16.625
Thank you so much.

12:16.625 --> 12:18.166
The only thing is
they need it by tomorrow,

12:18.166 --> 12:19.250
so can you check in
tonight?

12:19.250 --> 12:20.291
Yes.
One question--

12:20.291 --> 12:22.125
is it against protocol
to bring my boyfriend?

12:22.125 --> 12:23.750
'Cause we were planning
a little celebration tonight

12:23.750 --> 12:25.667
'cause he actually got cast
in a Broadway show.

12:25.667 --> 12:28.583
Broadway, huh?
Well, have fun.

12:31.041 --> 12:33.375
What the fuck is "have fun"
supposed to mean?

12:33.375 --> 12:35.417
I think it just means
you should have fun.

12:35.417 --> 12:36.333
That's it.

12:36.333 --> 12:37.625
Or did she mean, like,
"Have fun now

12:37.625 --> 12:40.166
because Broadway
is the most seductive
of mistresses"?

12:40.166 --> 12:41.834
What? No.
Why would it mean that?

12:41.834 --> 12:45.667
I'm sorry.
Patti LuPone just really
fucked with my head.

12:45.667 --> 12:46.792
I feel crazy.

12:46.792 --> 12:48.959
- Woman: Checks, ladies.
- Thank you.

12:48.959 --> 12:50.792
Thank you.

12:55.083 --> 12:56.208
Oh, my God.

12:56.208 --> 12:58.291
Okay, I think they forgot
to take taxes out.

12:58.291 --> 13:00.667
- This does not make sense.
- This your first paycheck?

13:00.667 --> 13:02.792
No, this is
the right amount.

13:02.792 --> 13:05.583
This is how much money
I make a week?

13:05.583 --> 13:08.417
- Yeah.
- This is a lot more
than my rent!

13:08.417 --> 13:09.500
This is insane.
I'm just gonna, like,

13:09.500 --> 13:11.166
walk into a store
in the meatpacking district

13:11.166 --> 13:12.625
and just be like,

What the fuck
are you doing here?

14:33.375 --> 14:34.458
Darling,
don't be vulgar.

14:34.458 --> 14:36.000
You know I hate it
when you're vulgar.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.708
Don't need to be vulgar
to make your point.

14:37.708 --> 14:39.458
What a charming
situation you have.

14:39.458 --> 14:41.417
( gasps )
Oh, my God.

14:41.417 --> 14:44.625
Beautiful little
Dust Bowl orphan.
I love it.

14:44.625 --> 14:47.542
- How on earth
did you find me?
- I came looking for you.

14:47.542 --> 14:49.834
I walked all the way
to the address that
you gave me.

14:49.834 --> 14:52.208
I even threw
little stones
at your window

14:52.208 --> 14:54.625
until some teensy-tiny
little moppet opened up,

14:54.625 --> 14:57.625
looked out, and said,
"Are you there to rape me?"

14:57.625 --> 15:00.708
Oh, Shoshanna.
Fucking Shoshanna.

15:00.708 --> 15:03.959
Are you angry with me
because it's taken me
so long to find you?

15:03.959 --> 15:05.208
Are you insane?

15:05.208 --> 15:07.708
Can you not see
how well I'm doing?

15:07.708 --> 15:10.333
I have a job,
I eat lunch every day,

15:10.333 --> 15:12.959
and I make transactions
and I get paid.

15:12.959 --> 15:15.417
Look at you, Jessamyn.
You're trying so hard.

15:15.417 --> 15:16.792
Don't you see
this is just pretend?

15:16.792 --> 15:19.834
- No, no.
I'm healthy.
- No, no, no.

15:19.834 --> 15:21.625
I'm healthy,
and the last thing I need

15:21.625 --> 15:23.000
is to be hanging out
with you.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.625
You can lie to your friends,
you can lie to your parents,

15:24.625 --> 15:26.208
you can lie to the mirror,
but you can't lie to me

15:26.208 --> 15:29.083
because I see
who you truly are.

15:29.083 --> 15:31.166
Oh, really?
And who's that?

15:31.166 --> 15:33.166
You're a wild thing.
You can't be tamed.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.583
I mean, we are not
the kind of people

15:34.583 --> 15:36.166
that sit around
in a store like this

15:36.166 --> 15:39.458
selling $200 bathing suits
to toddlers.

15:39.458 --> 15:40.750
That's not who we are.

15:40.750 --> 15:42.333
- You're high.
- No, no, no.

15:42.333 --> 15:45.166
I'm just excited
to be in New York
and to see you.

15:45.166 --> 15:47.417
I know what you need.
Come away with me.

15:47.417 --> 15:48.792
I know what you need.

15:48.792 --> 15:50.625
I'm not even
attracted to you.

15:50.625 --> 15:51.834
- Ooh, even better.
- I would--

15:51.834 --> 15:52.959
- No!
- Yes!

15:52.959 --> 15:56.500
I was wearing
rehab goggles.

16:04.083 --> 16:06.875
Holy crap.
This is so nice.

16:06.875 --> 16:08.959
It's not that nice.
How much do you get
in incidentals?

16:08.959 --> 16:11.375
- What are those?
- You need somebody
to explain to you

16:11.375 --> 16:14.625
your new moneyed lifestyle,
and I'm happy to be that person.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.834
Okay, let's order
a bunch of stuff
that Adam loves,

16:16.834 --> 16:18.792
then make
a big-ass sign.

16:18.792 --> 16:20.417
Just calm down.
The room's enough.

16:20.417 --> 16:22.500
But he's gonna
be on Broadway.

16:22.500 --> 16:23.667
I know.

16:23.667 --> 16:26.041
I have to admit, I never
thought he'd be the first.

16:26.041 --> 16:28.959
- The first what?
- To fulfill his dream.

16:28.959 --> 16:30.375
Well, that's not true.

16:30.375 --> 16:33.166
We've all fulfilled
various dreams in various ways.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.708
Also, I'm getting
so sick of people

16:34.708 --> 16:37.875
acting like Adam's
newfound success
in this arena

16:37.875 --> 16:39.125
is gonna come between us.

16:39.125 --> 16:41.542
I didn't say that.
Why are you acting weird?

16:41.542 --> 16:43.417
I could not be acting
more normal.

16:43.417 --> 16:44.667
Oh, my God.

16:44.667 --> 16:46.792
I cannot believe
that you have a room
at the Gramercy.

16:46.792 --> 16:49.792
Do you know they have
Mario Badescu products
in the bathroom here?

16:49.792 --> 16:51.500
I am totally stealing
some of those.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.083
What are we celebrating?

16:53.083 --> 16:55.417
- Adam's gonna be
on Broadway.
- Oh, my God.

16:55.417 --> 16:57.667
Are you afraid
he's gonna leave you
for Sutton Foster?

16:57.667 --> 17:00.083
- Ooh.
- What the fuck
is with everybody?

17:00.083 --> 17:01.625
No.

17:01.625 --> 17:05.416
( music playing )

17:05.416 --> 17:07.375
( door opens )

17:07.375 --> 17:09.416
I'm in a shitty mood.

17:09.416 --> 17:12.250
You know, every morning
I wake up feeling really good,

17:12.250 --> 17:14.250
feeling like I'm ready
to take on the day.

17:14.250 --> 17:17.791
Like, I don't know,
I want to fucking say
good morning to strangers.

17:17.791 --> 17:19.208
Shit I usually hate.

17:19.208 --> 17:21.083
And then,
without fail,

17:21.083 --> 17:22.583
something happens
at the yogurt shop

17:22.583 --> 17:24.500
that really just fucks
my shit up.

17:24.500 --> 17:25.583
Ruins my whole day.

17:25.583 --> 17:26.750
By the way,
your Netflix came.

17:26.750 --> 17:29.250
"Bridget Jones 2"?
Seriously?

17:32.000 --> 17:34.041
( Marnie groans )

17:34.041 --> 17:35.792
I can't do this.

17:35.792 --> 17:37.750
What do you mean?

17:37.750 --> 17:39.959
I mean...

17:39.959 --> 17:41.917
I don't want to do this.

17:42.959 --> 17:44.083
Um...

17:44.083 --> 17:45.959
I want a girlfriend,
Marnie.

17:45.959 --> 17:48.291
Like, a legitimate
girlfriend.

17:48.291 --> 17:51.291
You know, I want to have
a relationship that's deep

17:51.291 --> 17:53.959
and sincere
and challenging and scary.

17:53.959 --> 17:56.375
Not, you know--

17:56.375 --> 17:57.667
I want it to be real.

17:57.667 --> 17:59.792
I want to meet a girl
that I have a lot
in common with

17:59.792 --> 18:01.959
and ask her out
and learn about her family

18:01.959 --> 18:03.291
on a park bench
in the middle of the night.

18:03.291 --> 18:06.166
And if things go
really well, maybe invite
her back to my place

18:06.166 --> 18:07.959
and put on
some Roxy Music.

18:07.959 --> 18:09.625
You know?

18:09.625 --> 18:11.625
So, you're dumping me?

18:13.834 --> 18:15.500
Are you fucking serious?

18:15.500 --> 18:18.166
You can't
break up with me, Ray.
I don't care about this.

18:18.166 --> 18:21.291
I wouldn't be eating
pizza in front of you
if I actually liked you.

18:21.291 --> 18:24.417
I realize this doesn't
make sense biologically--

18:24.417 --> 18:26.333
Was this your plan
the whole time, Ray?

18:26.333 --> 18:29.000
To humiliate the girl
that you couldn't get
in high school?

18:29.000 --> 18:33.458
Well, guess what?
It's not gonna fucking work
because I don't care.

18:37.792 --> 18:40.083
( door opens, slams )

18:42.166 --> 18:44.333
( knocks )
Hello?

18:49.959 --> 18:52.542
Jesus fucking Christ.

18:52.542 --> 18:54.959
- Hello?
- Congratulations!

18:54.959 --> 18:56.708
What the fuck is--
( laughs )

18:56.708 --> 18:59.583
- You're a nut.
- You're a nut for the stage.

18:59.583 --> 19:01.125
- I love you.
- Congratulations.

19:01.125 --> 19:02.750
- That's really sweet.
- ( laughs )

19:02.750 --> 19:04.875
Hannah, this is Desi.
He's playing--

19:04.875 --> 19:06.333
- Bill Walker?
- Adam: Yes.

19:06.333 --> 19:08.583
- You just look like
such a Bill Walker.
- Thanks.

19:08.583 --> 19:10.208
I'm just a crazy
"Major Barbara" fan

19:10.208 --> 19:12.208
and kind of obsessed
with Shaw in general.

19:12.208 --> 19:13.875
Oh, smart girl.

19:13.875 --> 19:15.208
Hi.

19:15.208 --> 19:16.875
- Hey.
- Hi, sorry,
I recognize you

19:16.875 --> 19:18.333
from your part
on "One Tree Hill."

19:18.333 --> 19:20.667
You were Lennon,
the disabled gay
hockey player.

19:20.667 --> 19:23.041
Yes, yeah.
Super lucky part.

19:23.041 --> 19:25.166
I'm not what you would call
a "One Tree Hill" fan,

19:25.166 --> 19:26.959
but I have seen
every episode,

19:26.959 --> 19:29.041
and you really just

19:29.041 --> 19:31.959
are taking up
their game a notch.
( laughs )

19:31.959 --> 19:34.667
( laughs )
Thank you. Thanks.

19:34.667 --> 19:36.959
So, I'm in Idaho,
back country,

19:36.959 --> 19:38.458
all I have
is a saddle blanket,

19:38.458 --> 19:40.500
buck knife, some water
I packed in,

19:40.500 --> 19:45.083
and I realize that
it's my mom's birthday, right?

19:45.083 --> 19:48.166
Now, I fucked up
loads of stuff in my life,

19:48.166 --> 19:50.166
I'm not gonna forget
my mom's birthday.

19:50.166 --> 19:52.875
- You wouldn't do that.
- You would never do that.

19:52.875 --> 19:55.041
All of a sudden,
I see a structure.

19:55.041 --> 19:56.208
Maybe it's a fire tower

19:56.208 --> 19:58.166
or some kind
of ranger station,
long forgotten.

19:58.166 --> 19:59.917
- I don't understand--
- Shh.

19:59.917 --> 20:01.417
Okay. Okay.

20:01.417 --> 20:04.417
Desi:
And just as I get through
the door, I almost step on--

20:04.417 --> 20:08.750
Congratulations, Adam.
Oh, my God, so exciting.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.959
Are you, uh, okay?

20:10.959 --> 20:13.125
Me?
Yeah, so good.

20:13.125 --> 20:14.375
I'm just gonna run
to the restroom.

20:14.375 --> 20:16.458
- I'll be right back.
- Hannah: Okay.

20:18.417 --> 20:21.250
Ha! That is
a fucking closet.

20:21.250 --> 20:24.917
Okay, I don't know
what I'm in trouble
for now, but...

20:26.792 --> 20:30.083
So there I am on a sort
of vision quest...

20:30.083 --> 20:32.000
( exhales )

20:32.000 --> 20:34.917
- ( knock on door )
- Hannah: Marn?

20:34.917 --> 20:36.625
Come in.

20:39.417 --> 20:42.000
Hey, what's going on?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.750
Nothing.

20:43.750 --> 20:46.667
- Are you sure?
- Dead sure.

20:46.667 --> 20:49.041
Okay, what's wrong?

20:52.458 --> 20:54.500
I can't tell you.

20:59.750 --> 21:02.250
( guitar playing )

21:02.250 --> 21:05.375
- Desi: ♪ Oh,
roll on, John... ♪
- ( crying )

21:05.375 --> 21:08.417
♪ Don't you roll
so slow? ♪

21:11.834 --> 21:17.458
♪ How you gonna roll ♪

21:17.458 --> 21:21.083

- Are they fucking kidding me?

21:55.708 --> 21:58.041
I hate myself
for loving him.

21:58.750 --> 22:04.208
♪ Till I thought... ♪

22:04.208 --> 22:10.041
( joins in )
♪ The more she cried ♪

22:10.041 --> 22:13.959
♪ The worse I felt... ♪

22:13.959 --> 22:15.375
( hums )

22:15.375 --> 22:18.375
So after shows,
you can really only
go, like, two places.

22:18.375 --> 22:19.959
You can go to
the Glass House Tavern

22:19.959 --> 22:21.166
or you can go
to Bar Centrale.

22:21.166 --> 22:23.041
Bar Centrale is really
more for, like,

22:23.041 --> 22:25.667
the famous, you know,
stars of the show,

22:25.667 --> 22:28.834
and then Glass House
is more for, like,
the chorus kids.

22:28.834 --> 22:30.417
And also one time
I read this interview

22:30.417 --> 22:32.250
with Sarah Jessica Parker
in "Backstage,"

22:32.250 --> 22:33.750
and she was saying
that it's super important

22:33.750 --> 22:36.083
to learn the names
of all of the crew.

22:36.083 --> 22:38.542
And, if you can, like,
a couple of their wives

22:38.542 --> 22:40.375
because it means a lot
to those people.

22:40.375 --> 22:41.542
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:41.542 --> 22:44.750
Don't you get tired
of going to the bar
afterwards

22:44.750 --> 22:46.250
when you wanna
go home and get some--

22:46.250 --> 22:47.375
No, that's, like,
part of the--

22:47.375 --> 22:49.250
I mean, that's where
you meet people and stuff.

22:49.250 --> 22:51.458
That's where one time
I saw Tyne Daly
get super drunk

22:51.458 --> 22:53.041
and fall down
a flight of stairs.

22:53.041 --> 22:54.250
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

22:54.250 --> 22:56.542
- Oh, fuck.
- I know, right?
It's pretty awesome.

22:56.542 --> 22:57.458
Hannah?

22:57.458 --> 23:00.625
You know, your voice
is really--

23:00.625 --> 23:03.083
I'm trying to summon
the right adjective here.

23:03.083 --> 23:05.792
- Grating? Is that what--
- No, come on.

23:05.792 --> 23:08.125
No.

23:08.125 --> 23:09.667
- I love that song.
- Oh, yeah.

23:09.667 --> 23:11.875
- I love Michelle Branch.
- Dylan.

23:13.291 --> 23:15.125
Yeah, Dylan too.

23:15.125 --> 23:16.834
I'd love to hear
some more of your music.

23:16.834 --> 23:20.291
- Do you write?
- Um, yeah. Really, do you--

23:20.291 --> 23:21.458
Absolutely, yeah.

23:21.458 --> 23:25.250
Okay, I, uh--
if I give you
my email address,

23:25.250 --> 23:27.250
then you can shoot me
an email so I have yours,

23:27.250 --> 23:28.583
and then
I'll just email you

23:28.583 --> 23:32.208
my Dropbox folder
of my latest attempts.

23:32.208 --> 23:33.792
See? "Attempts."
Don't do that.

23:33.792 --> 23:35.875
Seriously.
Don't deprecate yourself.

23:35.875 --> 23:38.792
Really, you're better
than that.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.083
Okay.

23:40.083 --> 23:41.208
I don't know
if Hannah's told you,

23:41.208 --> 23:43.000
but I'm really trying
to make a concerted effort

23:43.000 --> 23:46.500
to break out
of the contemporary
dance world,

23:46.500 --> 23:48.750
and if you could maybe
give me an introduction

23:48.750 --> 23:50.750
to the Broadway world,
that'd be great.

23:50.750 --> 23:52.875
I mean, the closest
I've gotten is,

23:52.875 --> 23:55.583
you know, a hand job
from a guy from "Pippin,"

23:55.583 --> 23:57.417
- so it's like-- yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

23:57.417 --> 24:00.083
Marnface1988@aol.com.

24:00.083 --> 24:01.291
That's me.

24:01.291 --> 24:03.542
All right, I should
really hit the trail.

24:03.542 --> 24:06.083
My Clementine's making
paella tonight.

24:06.083 --> 24:08.500
- Is that a song?
- No, that's like a--

24:08.500 --> 24:11.792
like a Valencian rice
seafood dish.

24:11.792 --> 24:14.041
Oh, it just sounded
like a folk song.

24:14.041 --> 24:16.250
I thought they were
folk lyrics or something.

24:16.250 --> 24:19.750
"Gotta hit the trail,
my Clementine's making
paella tonight."

24:19.750 --> 24:23.125
No, that's, like,
one of those big
four-hander pans,

24:23.125 --> 24:25.542
so I gotta help
take it off.

24:25.542 --> 24:27.834
Oh, okay.

24:27.834 --> 24:29.875
Roll on, John.

24:31.250 --> 24:34.083
If you ever need
any, you know, help,
if you have questions

24:34.083 --> 24:36.208
- about figuring out
what's what.
- You know, I don't.

24:36.208 --> 24:37.417
I think I'm good.

24:37.417 --> 24:40.041
I don't really want
to be a part of the scene.

24:41.458 --> 24:43.041
The Broadway scene?

24:43.041 --> 24:44.333
Any scene.

24:44.333 --> 24:45.792
Well, don't come
crying to me

24:45.792 --> 24:49.542
when Kristin Chenoweth
passes out 'cause you
forgot to feed her.

24:51.208 --> 24:53.250
- Here's Johnny!
- Yeah!

24:53.250 --> 24:55.000
( both laughing )

24:55.000 --> 24:56.583
- Hi, I'm Jasper. Hi, hi.
- Oh, hey.

24:56.583 --> 25:00.375
- Hi, hi.
- Shosh, so great to--
mwah-- see you!

25:00.375 --> 25:03.417
- Oh, hi.
- Jasper: I know everybody's
name because she told me.

25:03.417 --> 25:04.750
Buck.

25:04.750 --> 25:07.500
- Uh, Obadiah.
- Yep.

25:07.500 --> 25:09.291
- Uh, Janet.
- Mm-hmm.

25:09.291 --> 25:12.667
- Raquel, Snoop.
- Yep.

25:12.667 --> 25:14.875
Hazel.
See? Told ya.

25:14.875 --> 25:17.208
- Come on.
- Pretty good.

25:19.166 --> 25:22.125
So we maybe shouldn't have
taken her out of rehab.

25:22.125 --> 25:24.125
- Higher education
is elitist horseshit...
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

25:24.125 --> 25:25.625
perpetrated by a bunch
of privileged hacks

25:25.625 --> 25:28.208
who think accumulating degrees
amounts to a meaningful life.

25:28.208 --> 25:29.208
I know, I know.

25:29.208 --> 25:30.458
But, like, I am out
of there in three weeks.

25:30.458 --> 25:32.875
Like, I am done,
I am graduating,
I am done with that.

25:32.875 --> 25:34.166
They say they're
teaching you to think,

25:34.166 --> 25:35.458
but really they're
teaching you to think
like everybody else.

25:35.458 --> 25:38.417
I know! I know!
It's like, literally,
I swear to God,

25:38.417 --> 25:39.750
sometimes I feel like
I am in "The Truman Show,"

25:39.750 --> 25:42.000
but it's, like,
really just a walking
American Apparel ad

25:42.000 --> 25:43.583
and I don't
even know it.

25:43.583 --> 25:44.834
Too late for you,
then, poor baby.

25:44.834 --> 25:46.834
- Have you got any cocaine?
- No, I don't do cocaine.

25:46.834 --> 25:48.083
But you're
clearly on cocaine.

25:48.083 --> 25:49.542
Oh, no, everybody
thinks that,

25:49.542 --> 25:51.542
but I just have
really chronic congestion

25:51.542 --> 25:52.875
- and, like,
a terribly fast mouth.
- ( whistling )

25:52.875 --> 25:55.667
Is this living
or is this living,
my flower?

25:55.667 --> 25:57.959
- This is living.
- Oh.

25:57.959 --> 25:59.500
Uh, have you got
more coke?

25:59.500 --> 26:01.125
Have you got
more money?

26:01.125 --> 26:03.125
No, but I know
where to get some.

26:03.125 --> 26:06.458
- ( gasps ) You do?
- Yes! I do, I do, I do.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.041
( alarm beeping )

26:13.041 --> 26:14.875
( keypad beeping )

26:14.875 --> 26:17.500
Yes! Can you believe
I remembered that?

26:17.500 --> 26:20.250
- Shh, okay, okay, okay.
- You're a legend.

26:20.250 --> 26:23.125
- ( keys drop )
- Shh.

26:23.125 --> 26:24.792
- ( rattles )
- No.

26:24.792 --> 26:27.125
- ( rattles )
- No.

26:29.959 --> 26:32.000
- ( gasps )
- Oh, my God.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.375
Who keeps their money
in a shoebox?

26:34.375 --> 26:36.250
- We will.
- ( gasps )

26:36.250 --> 26:38.000
Oh, my God.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.667
( sniffs )

26:41.125 --> 26:42.792
( sniffs )

26:45.500 --> 26:47.667
( sighs )

26:47.667 --> 26:50.291
Okay, all right, all right.
That's good.

26:52.500 --> 26:57.583
Elijah talks a lot
about really stupid shit.

26:57.583 --> 26:59.834
Okay, well, maybe
that's what I think

26:59.834 --> 27:03.500
about that weird folk-singing
grifter you brought over.

27:03.500 --> 27:06.250
- Desi?
- "Desi"? Yeah.

27:06.250 --> 27:09.667
- What?
- Yeah, I found him irksome.

27:09.667 --> 27:11.917
You don't have to say that
to get revenge on me.

27:11.917 --> 27:13.667
I'm not gonna say something
to get revenge on you.

27:13.667 --> 27:15.875
This isn't like
"Count of Monte Cristo."

27:15.875 --> 27:18.166
( laughs )

27:18.166 --> 27:19.625
I'm so proud of you.

27:19.625 --> 27:21.875
I'm so proud of you.
( kisses )

27:21.875 --> 27:25.625
I don't know how to say this
without it coming out
sounding horrible.

27:26.625 --> 27:28.667
I don't want you

27:28.667 --> 27:31.500
to get so, um...

27:31.500 --> 27:34.083
happy doing the play
that you...

27:34.083 --> 27:37.500
don't like
our life together
anymore.

27:40.125 --> 27:42.834
Are you upset
I'm doing the play?

27:44.208 --> 27:45.708
No.

27:45.708 --> 27:47.208
No.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.542
I'm so happy you're doing
what makes you happy

27:49.542 --> 27:53.000
because I love you
and you're the only person
I've ever loved

27:53.000 --> 27:55.750
and you're the only person
I ever wanna love.

27:56.917 --> 27:58.875
Well, ditto.

28:02.417 --> 28:04.834
Okay, good.

28:04.834 --> 28:06.500
Then...

28:07.834 --> 28:09.208
do your lines.

28:09.208 --> 28:10.875
- No.
- Do your lines.

28:10.875 --> 28:12.500
No.

28:13.375 --> 28:15.583
- ( laughs ) No.
- Please?

28:15.583 --> 28:18.625
- ( groans )
I don't wanna.
- Please, please?

28:18.625 --> 28:21.917
"Not that kind of snob,
but a genteel sort."

28:21.917 --> 28:23.750
- Can you do it with
the accent, please?
- "I'm too--"

28:23.750 --> 28:25.500
( British accent )
"Not that kind of snob,
but the genteel sort."

28:25.500 --> 28:27.792
- ( gasps ) No.
- "I'm too uppish,
owing to my intelligence,

28:27.792 --> 28:30.875
and my father being
a Chartist and a reading,
thinking man--

28:30.875 --> 28:32.500
a stationer, too.

28:32.500 --> 28:36.000
I am none of
your common hewers of wood
and drawers of water.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
And don't you
forget it."

28:39.000 --> 28:40.583
- ( both laughing )
- It's so good.

28:40.583 --> 28:44.208
- ( music playing )
- You're so good at that.
