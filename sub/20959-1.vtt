01:07.234 --> 01:09.469
I don't think I can do this.

01:09.471 --> 01:10.703
Yes you can.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.108
I'm Aaron by the way, and you
have nothing to worry about.

01:15.110 --> 01:16.109
I'm the best.

01:16.111 --> 01:16.843
You are?

01:16.845 --> 01:18.812
Yeah, won't hurt a bit.

01:18.814 --> 01:20.113
Promise?

01:20.115 --> 01:21.181
I promise.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.552
Here, squeeze on this.

01:28.689 --> 01:29.689
Oh god.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.827
How long you been doing this?

01:33.829 --> 01:35.161
10 years.

01:35.163 --> 01:36.629
See? He knows what he's doing.

01:36.631 --> 01:38.198
It's just
gonna be a little stick.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.499
Nothing to worry about.

01:39.501 --> 01:40.433
Okay, wait, wait.

01:40.435 --> 01:42.168
You're supposed to hold my hand.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.236
Ow.

01:44.605 --> 01:45.839
Here we go.

01:45.841 --> 01:49.642
It'll just come and go,
you won't even know.

01:52.447 --> 01:53.880
Hello?

01:53.882 --> 01:54.882
Yeah.

01:57.318 --> 01:59.185
Well, what'd he do?

02:40.194 --> 02:40.827
Hello.

02:40.829 --> 02:42.262
I'm here for Tate.

02:42.264 --> 02:44.230
Oh yes, you can sign
him out right there.

02:44.232 --> 02:46.266
Oh, and Dr. Donnelly
wants to speak

02:46.268 --> 02:48.268
with you if you have a minute.

02:48.270 --> 02:49.169
Sure.

02:49.171 --> 02:52.172
He'll have to serve
an in-school suspension,

02:52.174 --> 02:53.673
just one day.

02:53.675 --> 02:55.875
Well he's never done
anything like this before.

02:55.877 --> 02:58.178
I know, but it's
zero-tolerance.

02:58.180 --> 02:59.846
We have to follow the rules.

02:59.848 --> 03:02.282
I understand, I understand.

03:02.284 --> 03:04.584
Are you sure he
tripped them, though?

03:04.586 --> 03:05.852
He admitted it.

03:05.854 --> 03:07.253
Okay.

03:07.255 --> 03:10.823
How's he doing at home?

03:10.825 --> 03:13.193
Uh, fine, I guess.

03:13.195 --> 03:15.228
What do you mean,
since the accident?

03:15.230 --> 03:16.796
Well it's only
been a year, right?

03:16.798 --> 03:19.232
It hasn't been a year yet.

03:19.234 --> 03:21.201
You know, it's been tough.

03:21.203 --> 03:21.201
Of course.

03:21.203 --> 03:25.505
But, I don't mean that
as an excuse or anything.

03:25.507 --> 03:28.608
Well I certainly think it
helps to explain his behavior.

03:28.610 --> 03:30.276
He's such a good kid.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.377
Yeah.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.004
So what's going on with you?

03:58.006 --> 03:59.006
Nothing.

04:01.275 --> 04:04.677
They don't send
you home for nothing.

04:04.679 --> 04:06.412
We should go home.

04:07.982 --> 04:09.249
All right.

04:25.299 --> 04:27.367
Here at JPL, we
have to solve problems

04:27.369 --> 04:28.968
that nobody's ever
solved before.

04:28.970 --> 04:31.571
And something the solutions
can seem a little crazy.

04:31.573 --> 04:35.341
Today we're gonna talk
about this bad boy.

04:39.446 --> 04:43.349
So when are you gonna
tell me what happened?

04:45.986 --> 04:46.819
Tate!

04:46.821 --> 04:47.954
What?

04:47.956 --> 04:49.656
What happened with Justin?

04:49.658 --> 04:52.392
He won't leave me
alone, that's what.

04:52.394 --> 04:53.293
I hate him.

04:53.295 --> 04:54.694
Why, what does he do?

04:54.696 --> 04:57.964
He pushes me and
slaps me on the head.

04:57.966 --> 04:59.332
In class?

04:59.334 --> 05:01.401
In class, in the bathroom,

05:01.403 --> 05:03.303
during PE, all the time.

05:03.305 --> 05:04.637
And he calls me a pussy.

05:04.639 --> 05:06.539
I got sick of it,
so I tripped him.

05:06.541 --> 05:10.410
And you think that's
a smart thing to do.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.846
Why didn't you say something?

05:13.848 --> 05:15.648
What am I supposed to say?

05:15.650 --> 05:16.983
What are you supposed to say?

05:16.985 --> 05:19.085
You need to tell a
teacher, that's what.

05:19.087 --> 05:21.321
No, they would call me snitch.

05:21.323 --> 05:23.690
What, who cares if some
punk calls you a snitch?

05:23.692 --> 05:26.326
Why didn't you at least tell me?

05:26.328 --> 05:28.027
I'm telling you now.

05:30.064 --> 05:32.365
Tate, if he touches you again,

05:32.367 --> 05:33.833
I'm talking to the principal.

05:33.835 --> 05:35.335
No, I can take care of it!

05:35.337 --> 05:36.869
What, do you think
he's just gonna let you

05:36.871 --> 05:37.704
get away with tripping him?

05:37.706 --> 05:38.905
It's too dangerous,

05:38.907 --> 05:40.340
you need to be careful
in your condition!

05:40.342 --> 05:41.374
I know, dad.

05:57.759 --> 05:59.592
Time to wrap it up!

06:12.406 --> 06:13.439
Oops.

06:13.441 --> 06:15.141
Sorry, didn't mean to.

06:26.387 --> 06:28.388
Payback's a bitch, huh?

06:36.797 --> 06:37.797
Coach!

07:06.794 --> 07:07.794
Hello?

07:07.796 --> 07:09.462
Uh, Mr. Diaz?

07:09.464 --> 07:09.462
Yes?

07:09.464 --> 07:13.499
There's been
an emergency with Tate.

07:13.501 --> 07:14.901
Which hospital?

07:14.903 --> 07:18.538
Well, did you tell them
he's a hemophiliac?

07:18.540 --> 07:20.506
Hi, my son was just brought in.

07:20.508 --> 07:21.507
What's his name?

07:21.509 --> 07:22.575
Tate Diaz.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.145
He's in ICU.

07:26.147 --> 07:27.147
ICU?

07:32.219 --> 07:33.453
God.

07:33.455 --> 07:33.453
What happened?

07:33.455 --> 07:36.989
I don't know, I haven't
heard anything yet.

07:36.991 --> 07:38.658
This isn't good.

07:38.660 --> 07:41.194
I'm not worried about
the hairline fracture

07:41.196 --> 07:42.995
to the outer nasal bone.

07:42.997 --> 07:44.597
The damage to the
internal cartilage,

07:44.599 --> 07:46.866
while normally
not a big concern,

07:46.868 --> 07:49.669
is a pretty big deal to
a kid with hemophilia.

07:49.671 --> 07:52.171
Blood was collecting
deep inside the tissue

07:52.173 --> 07:52.171
and behind his eyes,

07:52.173 --> 07:55.775
but we were able to relieve
some of the pressure

07:55.777 --> 07:56.943
and stop the bleeding.

07:56.945 --> 07:58.945
It's a highly
uncomfortable procedure,

07:58.947 --> 08:01.013
so we had to sedate him.

08:02.883 --> 08:04.116
And now?

08:04.118 --> 08:05.618
He's doing okay
for the time being,

08:05.620 --> 08:07.220
but we'll need to
keep an eye on him.

08:07.222 --> 08:09.689
There's a chance he could
start hemorrhaging again.

08:09.691 --> 08:14.560
There's no doubt, he's
still in critical condition.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.496
How much blood did you give him?

08:16.498 --> 08:17.897
We transfused one unit,

08:17.899 --> 08:20.099
we have two more on standby.

08:20.101 --> 08:21.501
Jesus.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.670
You're sure you
don't want me to stay.

08:24.672 --> 08:25.905
I'm sure, go home.

08:25.907 --> 08:27.106
I can get you something to eat.

08:27.108 --> 08:27.106
I'm fine, I'll
grab something here.

08:27.108 --> 08:31.010
Well, if you need
anything, you call me, okay?

08:31.012 --> 08:31.944
All right.

08:31.946 --> 08:33.246
And call me when he wakes up.

08:33.248 --> 08:34.981
I don't even care what
time it is, I mean it.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.082
And tell him I love him.

08:36.083 --> 08:39.051
And I love you too,
little brother.

08:41.255 --> 08:44.256
Call me.

08:45.592 --> 08:46.659
All right.

08:49.563 --> 08:51.797
I'm sorry, didn't
mean to disturb.

08:51.799 --> 08:54.534
Oh you didn't, please come in.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.004
May I be of service to you?

08:58.006 --> 08:59.006
Service?

09:00.274 --> 09:03.009
I'm father Kane,
the hospital chaplain.

09:03.011 --> 09:04.644
Oh, okay.

09:04.646 --> 09:06.579
Well, I'm not really
sure what I'm doing here.

09:06.581 --> 09:08.214
I haven't been to church
since I was a kid.

09:08.216 --> 09:12.051
Do you have someone, a
relative in the hospital?

09:12.053 --> 09:13.119
Yeah, my son.

09:13.121 --> 09:14.186
How is he?

09:16.657 --> 09:17.657
Not good.

09:17.659 --> 09:21.661
I mean, he's fine,
just worried about him.

09:21.663 --> 09:23.296
What's your son's name?

09:23.298 --> 09:24.630
Tate.

09:24.632 --> 09:26.332
How old is Tate?

09:26.334 --> 09:27.334
He's 12.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.235
Ah.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.607
Tell me more about him.

09:40.681 --> 09:41.314
Okay.

09:41.316 --> 09:42.815
He's a great kid.

09:43.650 --> 09:45.885
Smart, talented, you know.

09:48.322 --> 09:50.323
He used to be so happy.

09:50.325 --> 09:51.624
Used to be?

09:51.626 --> 09:53.759
Yeah, uh, my wife, his mother,

09:53.761 --> 09:56.662
was in an accident
about a year ago.

09:56.664 --> 09:57.797
I'm sorry.

09:57.799 --> 09:59.198
How's he coping?

10:02.169 --> 10:03.302
He blames me.

10:03.304 --> 10:03.302
Why is that?

10:03.304 --> 10:06.973
Because it should
have been me instead.

10:06.975 --> 10:10.009
You sound as though
you agree with him.

10:10.011 --> 10:11.944
Well I wish it was me.

10:11.946 --> 10:15.681
I would've traded places
with her in a second.

10:15.683 --> 10:18.651
Guilt is a hard
thing to live with.

10:19.686 --> 10:21.053
Irrational or not.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.625
Are you sure he blames you?

10:25.627 --> 10:28.728
Or is the blame
more self-imposed?

10:30.230 --> 10:31.731
Uh, I gotta go.

10:36.803 --> 10:41.307
Would you like for me
to go up and see him?

10:41.309 --> 10:42.775
Why?

10:42.777 --> 10:45.077
Dear Jesus, our lord and savior,

10:45.079 --> 10:48.247
divine physician, and
healer of the sick,

10:48.249 --> 10:51.217
we turn to you in
this time of illness.

10:51.219 --> 10:54.020
Oh dearest comforter
of the trouble,

10:54.022 --> 10:58.257
alleviate our worry and
sorrow with your gentle love.

10:59.426 --> 11:02.194
And Grant us the
grace and strength

11:02.196 --> 11:04.797
to accept this burden.

11:04.799 --> 11:06.766
We place our sick
under your care

11:06.768 --> 11:09.335
and humbly ask that you
restore your servant

11:09.337 --> 11:11.771
back to health again.

11:11.773 --> 11:14.040
In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

11:14.042 --> 11:15.107
Amen.

11:15.109 --> 11:16.109
Amen.

12:30.350 --> 12:31.350
Tate?

12:33.754 --> 12:34.854
Tate?

12:45.832 --> 12:46.999
Where's my son?

12:47.001 --> 12:48.534
Is he a patient?

12:48.536 --> 12:49.835
Yes, he's been moved.

12:49.837 --> 12:51.170
Name?

12:51.172 --> 12:52.238
Tate Diaz.

12:53.507 --> 12:55.508
I don't see him registered.

12:55.510 --> 12:57.510
Could it be under another name?

12:57.512 --> 12:58.477
What are you talking about?

12:58.479 --> 13:00.146
He was in room 319.

13:02.816 --> 13:05.785
No, nobody's been in
room 319 since Sunday.

13:05.787 --> 13:07.086
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

13:07.088 --> 13:08.354
Sir, please lower your tone

13:08.356 --> 13:09.455
or I'll have to call security.

13:09.457 --> 13:10.856
What kind of a hospital is this?

13:10.858 --> 13:11.824
Where the fuck is my son?

13:11.826 --> 13:11.824
Jesus Christ!

13:11.826 --> 13:15.928
I need security on
floor three please.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.230
Tate!

13:21.868 --> 13:22.868
Tate!

13:24.971 --> 13:25.971
Shit.

13:30.577 --> 13:31.811
Come on.

13:31.813 --> 13:32.813
Shit!

13:39.019 --> 13:40.019
What?

13:41.888 --> 13:42.521
Tate?

13:42.523 --> 13:43.856
Dad.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.358
Tate, where are you?

13:46.360 --> 13:47.526
Dad.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.830
Tate, where are
you, I don't see you.

13:50.832 --> 13:51.864
Dad.

13:51.866 --> 13:52.531
What is this?

13:52.533 --> 13:53.866
Dad!

13:53.868 --> 13:54.900
Dad!

13:54.902 --> 13:55.534
Tate!

13:55.536 --> 13:56.869
Dad.

13:57.904 --> 13:59.371
Dad, what happened?

14:00.240 --> 14:01.407
Tate.

14:01.409 --> 14:03.175
Oh my god, hey.

14:03.177 --> 14:04.577
What happened?

14:04.579 --> 14:07.246
What, don't you remember?

14:07.248 --> 14:09.415
I was in an ambulance.

14:09.417 --> 14:10.883
Yeah.

14:10.885 --> 14:13.252
Yeah, you lost a lot of blood.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.322
Where's your bandage?

14:16.324 --> 14:17.623
Oh, it was annoying.

14:17.625 --> 14:18.624
What?

14:18.626 --> 14:19.925
So I took it off.

14:19.927 --> 14:21.393
Tate, what are you doing?

14:21.395 --> 14:22.895
You can't do that!

14:22.897 --> 14:24.296
Why, it doesn't hurt.

14:24.298 --> 14:26.432
Stop, stop, be careful.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.870
Can we go home now?

14:30.872 --> 14:31.503
What?

14:31.505 --> 14:33.239
Can we go home now?

14:33.241 --> 14:35.074
Tate, it's five in the
morning, you need to rest.

14:35.076 --> 14:35.908
But I'm not tired.

14:35.910 --> 14:37.009
Just lay down, please?

14:41.581 --> 14:43.616
I don't see why
he can't go home.

14:43.618 --> 14:44.617
Just keep an eye on him,

14:44.619 --> 14:46.352
I'll need to see him in 10 days.

14:46.354 --> 14:47.519
Wow, okay.

14:47.521 --> 14:47.519
Thank you doctor.

14:47.521 --> 14:51.957
Stay put, I'll get someone
up here to get you discharged.

14:51.959 --> 14:54.960
Dad, aren't I gonna
be late for school?

14:54.962 --> 14:55.895
What?

14:55.897 --> 14:57.129
You're not going to school.

14:57.131 --> 14:59.098
I have a huge math
test today, I have to!

14:59.100 --> 15:00.266
Tate, it's about to start.

15:00.268 --> 15:01.467
You're never gonna
make it in time anyway.

15:01.469 --> 15:02.635
Dad, math doesn't
start until third block.

15:02.637 --> 15:04.937
It's okay if I'm late.

15:04.939 --> 15:05.939
You sure?

15:44.444 --> 15:45.711
I'm ready.

15:45.713 --> 15:48.180
Hey, not until you
have some breakfast.

15:48.182 --> 15:49.982
No, I'm not hungry,
can we just go?

15:49.984 --> 15:53.018
You gotta have something.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.988
That doesn't look
good right now.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.024
You're welcome.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.459
I'm just sick to my stomach.

16:00.461 --> 16:02.027
I'll eat something at school.

16:02.029 --> 16:03.629
Where are your glasses?

16:03.631 --> 16:05.130
They're messed up.

16:05.132 --> 16:06.665
What do you mean?

16:06.667 --> 16:08.167
I'll be fine without them.

16:08.169 --> 16:09.335
Since when?

16:11.972 --> 16:12.972
31!

16:15.742 --> 16:16.742
32!

16:20.413 --> 16:21.714
33.

16:21.716 --> 16:21.714
What's he doing?

16:21.716 --> 16:24.984
Diaz made 33 of those in a row.

16:24.986 --> 16:26.251
No he didn't.

16:26.253 --> 16:27.253
He's lying.

16:30.256 --> 16:32.358
Think I can clock him from here?

16:32.360 --> 16:33.192
No.

16:33.194 --> 16:34.426
Yeah I could.

16:34.428 --> 16:36.028
Bet you can't.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.332
What the?

16:45.372 --> 16:47.072
Guess he showed you.

16:47.074 --> 16:48.074
Shut up.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.086
That's mine.

17:01.088 --> 17:02.688
Oh, in that case.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.126
Don't mess with my stuff.

17:07.127 --> 17:11.163
Or you'll do what, you
motherless piece of shit?

17:14.769 --> 17:16.167
Get out of here!

17:18.738 --> 17:20.071
Leave me alone.

17:21.074 --> 17:22.174
Got it?

17:23.476 --> 17:24.476
Pussy?

17:26.479 --> 17:27.479
Hey!

17:29.049 --> 17:29.681
Got it?

17:29.683 --> 17:33.218
Yes, yes.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.161
How's it going, Mike?

17:43.196 --> 17:44.196
Mr. Tate.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.501
What's wrong?

17:50.637 --> 17:52.337
I'm not hungry.

17:52.339 --> 17:53.839
You serious?

17:53.841 --> 17:55.574
Did you eat lunch?

17:55.576 --> 17:56.576
Yes.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.546
Well, try it.

18:00.548 --> 18:01.548
For me.

18:06.152 --> 18:09.455
Hey Tate, come on, I
worked hard on this.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.162
How was school?

18:17.764 --> 18:19.398
Okay.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.332
Yeah?

18:20.334 --> 18:23.168
How'd you do on that test?

18:23.170 --> 18:24.170
Got a 97.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.139
Good job.

18:27.141 --> 18:28.273
That's great.

18:33.379 --> 18:35.881
I missed one I should have.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.219
What's wrong?

18:42.222 --> 18:43.222
What is it?

18:46.126 --> 18:47.126
Tate.

18:48.394 --> 18:49.394
Oh, man.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.664
Tate, are you all right, buddy?

18:52.666 --> 18:53.699
You okay?

18:53.701 --> 18:54.533
Uh huh.

18:54.535 --> 18:56.235
Here, let me see.

18:56.237 --> 18:59.638
You know, maybe I should take
you back to the hospital.

18:59.640 --> 19:00.873
No, I'm just tired.

19:00.875 --> 19:02.774
Can I go to bed?

19:02.776 --> 19:04.443
Yeah, yeah, okay.

19:41.247 --> 19:42.247
Hello?

19:46.352 --> 19:47.352
Hello?

19:48.955 --> 19:50.255
Tate?

19:51.591 --> 19:52.591
Tate!

20:06.739 --> 20:07.739
Tate!

20:12.845 --> 20:13.845
Tate.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.389
Tate.

20:38.938 --> 20:39.938
Tate!

20:46.279 --> 20:49.381
All right man, you're gonna
take it easy today, right?

20:49.383 --> 20:50.383
Yeah.

20:51.284 --> 20:53.352
All right, be careful.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.256
Love you!

20:57.258 --> 20:58.258
Bye.

23:06.018 --> 23:06.852
Dude.

23:06.854 --> 23:08.653
What's wrong with you?

23:08.655 --> 23:09.488
Nothing.

23:09.490 --> 23:10.856
You're all red.

23:10.858 --> 23:13.125
That's quite a sunburn, Tate.

23:13.127 --> 23:15.494
I don't think it's a sunburn.

23:15.496 --> 23:16.728
Then what is it?

23:16.730 --> 23:18.764
I don't know, it just happened.

23:18.766 --> 23:19.965
Just now?

23:19.967 --> 23:22.567
He was like, normal in science.

23:22.569 --> 23:25.504
Why don't you go to the nurse?

23:45.057 --> 23:46.558
Here you go, Tony.

23:52.532 --> 23:53.465
Yeah.

23:53.467 --> 23:54.966
Did you get in?

23:54.968 --> 23:55.801
I did.

23:55.803 --> 23:57.469
There's no alarm.

23:58.171 --> 23:59.204
Are we on?

23:59.206 --> 24:00.672
Yeah.

24:00.674 --> 24:02.441
It's a definite go.

24:08.781 --> 24:09.981
Okay.

24:09.983 --> 24:12.651
Are you feeling
dizzy, lightheaded?

24:12.653 --> 24:13.485
No.

24:13.487 --> 24:14.586
Any chest pain?

24:14.588 --> 24:15.687
No.

24:15.689 --> 24:16.521
Why?

24:16.523 --> 24:18.190
His pulse rate is 45.

24:18.192 --> 24:19.758
Is it normally that low?

24:19.760 --> 24:20.592
No, why?

24:20.594 --> 24:21.526
Is there a problem?

24:21.528 --> 24:22.828
Just out of the normal range.

24:22.830 --> 24:25.063
Could be from the nasal surgery.

24:25.065 --> 24:26.731
Could be medication.

24:26.733 --> 24:29.000
I'm sure it's nothing
to worry about.

24:29.002 --> 24:30.002
Okay.

24:31.471 --> 24:32.671
No allergies?

24:32.673 --> 24:33.905
No.

24:33.907 --> 24:35.207
I'm gonna give him a
low dose antihistamine.

24:35.209 --> 24:37.209
Not enough to affect
his platelet function.

24:37.211 --> 24:40.212
Could be a reaction to the
antibiotics you're taking.

24:40.214 --> 24:42.881
We sometimes see skin
allergies to the sun

24:42.883 --> 24:44.549
with certain medications.

24:44.551 --> 24:44.549
Okay.

24:44.551 --> 24:47.152
Keep him out of the
sun for a few days.

24:47.154 --> 24:50.555
Bring him back if you see
any signs of it reoccurring.

24:50.557 --> 24:51.490
All right.

24:51.492 --> 24:52.991
And what about his pulse?

24:52.993 --> 24:54.993
I'm gonna check his
thyroid to rule that out.

24:54.995 --> 24:56.595
Could be a number of things.

24:56.597 --> 24:59.130
Perhaps lingering effects
from the sedative.

24:59.132 --> 25:00.899
Drink lots of water, young man.

25:00.901 --> 25:01.833
Okay.

25:01.835 --> 25:03.235
All right, just hang tight.

25:03.237 --> 25:04.769
The nurse will be
back for a blood draw.

25:04.771 --> 25:06.571
We'll call you with the results.

25:06.573 --> 25:07.606
Sounds good.

25:09.542 --> 25:10.842
Thank you doctor.

25:15.748 --> 25:17.682
Time to go to sleep.

25:27.527 --> 25:29.160
Let me see your hand.

25:32.765 --> 25:33.932
What are you doing?

25:38.805 --> 25:39.805
Dad.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.274
Yeah.

25:42.276 --> 25:44.943
Why don't you call
me tater any more?

25:44.945 --> 25:47.913
It's been forever
since I called you that.

25:47.915 --> 25:49.214
Why'd you stop?

25:49.216 --> 25:52.317
Well, you were
embarrassed, remember?

25:52.319 --> 25:53.785
Oh yeah.

25:53.787 --> 25:56.254
You got all old
and mature on me.

25:56.256 --> 25:57.556
Why do you ask?

25:58.591 --> 26:00.025
Well, I was thinking about mom,

26:00.027 --> 26:02.193
and the trip we
took to lake Pahoe.

26:02.195 --> 26:03.195
Mm.

26:06.165 --> 26:07.165
Well.

26:09.569 --> 26:10.835
All right, well.

26:10.837 --> 26:12.237
Goodnight buddy.

26:15.308 --> 26:17.208
Love you dad.

26:17.210 --> 26:18.243
Love you too.

26:18.245 --> 26:19.245
Tater.

27:08.027 --> 27:10.328
That's the kid's bedroom.

28:35.014 --> 28:36.247
Get back.

28:36.249 --> 28:38.016
What the hell are you
doing, I said get back!

28:38.018 --> 28:38.850
What's going on?

28:38.852 --> 28:40.151
What do you want?

28:40.153 --> 28:41.886
I'm not gonna ask you
again, you son of a bitch!

28:41.888 --> 28:41.886
Don't shoot.

28:41.888 --> 28:41.886
What are you doing here?

28:41.888 --> 28:44.956
You really have no idea?

28:44.958 --> 28:44.956
Who are you?

28:44.958 --> 28:47.826
I'm just a guy trying
to do a good thing.

28:47.828 --> 28:48.727
Tate, are you okay?

28:48.729 --> 28:49.761
Yeah.

28:49.763 --> 28:50.395
Bleeding?

28:50.397 --> 28:50.395
Not for long.

28:50.397 --> 28:52.864
No, Tate, you keep
pressure on that.

28:52.866 --> 28:52.864
Tate.

28:52.866 --> 28:55.467
That's why I'm here, Mr. Diaz.

28:55.469 --> 28:56.768
How do you know my name?

28:56.770 --> 28:57.936
Dad!

28:57.938 --> 28:58.837
Give me the gun.

28:58.839 --> 28:59.471
Slowly!

28:59.473 --> 29:00.772
All right, all right.

29:00.774 --> 29:00.772
Mike?

29:00.774 --> 29:00.772
You know him?

29:00.774 --> 29:03.241
He works at my school.

29:03.243 --> 29:04.309
What do you want from us?

29:04.311 --> 29:04.309
I said on your knees!

29:04.311 --> 29:07.345
Okay, just tell me what
were you doing to my son.

29:07.347 --> 29:08.313
That thing's not your son.

29:08.315 --> 29:09.380
Your boy's dead.

29:09.382 --> 29:10.849
Earl was doing you a favor.

29:10.851 --> 29:12.417
What kind of sick
bastards are you?

29:12.419 --> 29:13.251
Huh?

29:13.253 --> 29:14.753
What do we do now?

29:14.755 --> 29:14.753
We go.

29:14.755 --> 29:17.155
We'll leave y'all
alone, call a truce.

29:17.157 --> 29:18.890
No! You, come with me!

29:18.892 --> 29:18.890
Why?

29:18.892 --> 29:18.890
Just for a minute, in the
other room, I wanna talk to you.

29:18.892 --> 29:22.127
No, he's gonna kill you.

29:22.129 --> 29:22.827
No I won't!

29:22.829 --> 29:22.827
Dad, don't!

29:22.829 --> 29:25.063
Shut up you fuckin' leech!

29:25.065 --> 29:26.164
Hey, he's just a kid, man!

29:26.166 --> 29:27.265
I said get up, you asshole.

29:27.267 --> 29:28.267
No!

29:30.536 --> 29:31.836
No!

29:35.875 --> 29:36.541
Watch your back.

29:36.543 --> 29:37.776
What?

29:37.778 --> 29:38.843
It'll turn on you.

29:38.845 --> 29:40.812
You need to take
Mike's head off,

29:40.814 --> 29:43.114
just in case, and do it soon.

29:44.784 --> 29:47.418
And the same with the boy.

29:47.420 --> 29:50.321
Cutting off the head
is the only way.

29:50.323 --> 29:53.391
I'd do it before the change
is done, once the heart stops

29:53.393 --> 29:55.193
there's no going back.

29:55.195 --> 29:56.195
Sorry.

30:02.501 --> 30:03.501
Tate.

30:04.203 --> 30:05.203
Please.

30:08.974 --> 30:09.974
Dad.

30:13.546 --> 30:15.046
Yeah?

30:15.048 --> 30:16.548
Look what I did.

30:16.550 --> 30:18.917
No, listen buddy,
it's not your fault.

30:18.919 --> 30:21.419
You were protecting me.

30:21.421 --> 30:23.054
Am I a vampire?

30:23.056 --> 30:23.988
What?

30:23.990 --> 30:26.224
No, there's no such thing.

30:29.562 --> 30:32.463
Tate, what are you doing?

30:34.100 --> 30:36.000
Tate, what did you do?

30:37.903 --> 30:39.037
What did you do?

30:39.039 --> 30:40.338
Dad, it doesn't hurt.

30:40.340 --> 30:41.306
Tate, what?

30:41.308 --> 30:43.208
I can't even feel it.

30:43.210 --> 30:44.242
Oh my god.

30:44.244 --> 30:47.478
I got some bad blood, didn't I?

30:47.480 --> 30:48.980
I don't know.

30:49.582 --> 30:50.548
Dad, make it stop.

30:50.550 --> 30:52.984
I don't wanna be like this.

30:54.186 --> 30:55.119
It's okay.

30:55.121 --> 30:56.387
You gotta fix me.

30:56.389 --> 30:57.422
We're gonna figure
something out.

30:57.424 --> 30:58.256
Promise?

30:58.258 --> 30:59.157
Yes, I promise.

30:59.159 --> 31:00.491
I promise you Tate.

31:00.493 --> 31:02.861
I promise, we'll fix this.

31:10.970 --> 31:11.970
Hello?

31:13.105 --> 31:14.239
Hey, it's me.

31:14.241 --> 31:16.875
What's wrong, is it Tate?

31:16.877 --> 31:17.942
No, no no.

31:19.945 --> 31:21.012
Well yeah.

31:21.014 --> 31:23.248
Well, is he okay?

31:23.250 --> 31:25.483
Yeah, he's fine, he's fine.

31:25.485 --> 31:28.319
I just need a place for
him to stay for a while.

31:28.321 --> 31:30.889
I was wondering if maybe he
could hang at your place?

31:30.891 --> 31:33.191
Yeah, of course, I'll
stay home from work.

31:33.193 --> 31:36.527
Oh no no no,
you don't have to do that.

31:36.529 --> 31:38.396
Are you gonna tell
me what's wrong?

31:38.398 --> 31:40.331
He's just not feeling very well.

31:40.333 --> 31:41.633
I gotta take care
of a few things,

31:41.635 --> 31:43.268
just figure some
stuff out, you know?

31:43.270 --> 31:45.904
Okay, you're scaring me.

31:45.906 --> 31:47.138
You sound weird.

31:47.140 --> 31:48.606
No no, I'm fine.

31:48.608 --> 31:50.141
Look, I'll explain later.

31:50.143 --> 31:52.076
I just wanna know if I
can bring him over now?

31:52.078 --> 31:53.144
Yeah, of course.

31:53.146 --> 31:54.178
Yeah?

31:54.180 --> 31:55.146
Okay.

31:55.148 --> 31:58.016
Cool, well, we'll be there soon.

32:01.287 --> 32:03.922
Is that aunt Karen?

32:03.924 --> 32:05.056
Yeah, yeah.

32:05.058 --> 32:10.528
Hey, you would never hurt
her or anything, would you?

32:10.530 --> 32:12.931
No, of course not.

32:12.933 --> 32:14.499
No, of course not.

32:14.501 --> 32:15.501
Sorry.

32:17.002 --> 32:19.037
Can I bring my game box?

32:20.706 --> 32:21.973
Yeah, of course buddy.

32:21.975 --> 32:24.375
Go ahead, whatever you want.

32:52.604 --> 32:53.604
You okay?

34:34.273 --> 34:35.339
Oh my god.

35:12.878 --> 35:13.878
Tate!

35:18.217 --> 35:19.784
Hey Tate, it's me!

35:26.291 --> 35:27.291
Karen?

35:34.233 --> 35:36.400
Hey buddy, where are you?

35:40.639 --> 35:42.173
Tate, you here?

35:43.342 --> 35:44.342
Oh, man.

35:52.484 --> 35:53.484
Tate!

35:55.687 --> 35:57.155
Damn!

35:57.157 --> 35:58.289
Tate, you here?

36:01.793 --> 36:02.793
Tate!

36:08.300 --> 36:09.300
Tate!

36:14.339 --> 36:15.339
Tate!

36:23.949 --> 36:25.283
Hey.

36:25.285 --> 36:26.717
Tate, what are you doing here?

36:26.719 --> 36:29.287
Why did you leave
me at aunt Karen's?

36:29.289 --> 36:30.755
What? I told you why.

36:30.757 --> 36:32.423
You left me all alone.

36:32.425 --> 36:33.958
Tate, we talked about it.

36:33.960 --> 36:35.293
How'd you get here?

36:35.295 --> 36:36.227
I walked.

36:36.229 --> 36:37.562
Come on, no you didn't.

36:37.564 --> 36:38.663
It's too far.

36:38.665 --> 36:40.331
Where's Karen?

36:40.333 --> 36:42.200
Where did you go?

36:42.202 --> 36:44.335
Well, I had to take
care of a few things.

36:44.337 --> 36:45.269
Without me?

36:45.271 --> 36:46.671
You could have at least told me!

36:46.673 --> 36:48.639
Tate, I did tell you!

36:48.641 --> 36:49.574
What's wrong with you?

36:49.576 --> 36:50.508
Why are you acting like this?

36:50.510 --> 36:52.376
Don't ever do that again!

36:52.378 --> 36:54.312
Hey, you don't take
that tone with me!

36:54.314 --> 36:56.314
You don't talk to your father
that way, do you hear me?

36:56.316 --> 36:58.216
Now where's Karen, is she here?

36:58.218 --> 36:59.350
She's dead.

37:00.485 --> 37:01.319
What?

37:01.321 --> 37:02.687
No.

37:02.689 --> 37:03.688
No, why?

37:03.690 --> 37:04.922
I killed her.

37:04.924 --> 37:06.557
Tate, what are
you talking about?

37:06.559 --> 37:07.959
You told me you
weren't gonna hurt her!

37:07.961 --> 37:09.327
I was thirsty and
you weren't there,

37:09.329 --> 37:10.962
what was I supposed to do?

37:10.964 --> 37:12.396
What?

37:12.398 --> 37:15.566
I killed her and now
I have to kill you.

38:10.055 --> 38:14.058
Cutting the
head off is the only way.

38:14.060 --> 38:16.360
I'd do it before
the change is done,

38:16.362 --> 38:18.996
once the heart stops, that's it,

38:18.998 --> 38:20.865
there's no going back.

38:25.604 --> 38:27.505
There's no going back.

38:46.858 --> 38:48.092
This is Earl.

38:48.094 --> 38:49.093
I need to see you.

38:49.095 --> 38:51.529
You said, once the heart stops,

38:51.531 --> 38:53.998
there's no going back.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.366
What does that mean?

38:55.368 --> 38:57.034
You can't reverse it.

38:57.036 --> 39:01.005
You mean, you mean
when the change is done.

39:01.007 --> 39:02.840
That's right.

39:02.842 --> 39:05.643
How do you know all this?

39:05.645 --> 39:08.746
I've been around a long time.

39:08.748 --> 39:11.115
So, how do we know
he's still changing?

39:11.117 --> 39:15.052
Well, he hasn't caught full
fire from the sun yet, has he?

39:15.054 --> 39:17.521
No he hasn't, but you're
saying that it could be reversed

39:17.523 --> 39:18.956
before that, before it's done.

39:18.958 --> 39:20.591
Look, forget I said that.

39:20.593 --> 39:21.859
I don't know that for sure.

39:21.861 --> 39:23.094
I've never seen it
with my own eyes,

39:23.096 --> 39:25.663
it's just what I've been told.

39:27.666 --> 39:29.367
I know it's your kid and all,

39:29.369 --> 39:30.901
but you gotta think about
saving your own ass now

39:30.903 --> 39:35.039
and everyone else, it's all
those innocent people out there.

39:35.041 --> 39:36.041
Okay?

39:37.943 --> 39:40.077
If you want my
help, just say the word.

39:40.079 --> 39:42.446
Yes, of course I want your help!

39:42.448 --> 39:44.014
I want you to help
me save my son.

39:44.016 --> 39:44.915
Tell me how!

39:44.917 --> 39:46.650
Please, hey, listen!

39:50.522 --> 39:51.522
Hey, look.

39:54.526 --> 39:56.594
It's my flesh and blood.

40:02.467 --> 40:04.502
How is he infected?

40:05.137 --> 40:06.737
I don't know exactly.

40:06.739 --> 40:08.539
Then there's no
point in discussing it.

40:08.541 --> 40:10.608
If you don't know who
infected him, forget it.

40:10.610 --> 40:11.742
It was a transfusion.

40:11.744 --> 40:13.043
Okay, that much I know.

40:13.045 --> 40:15.146
Please, I'll find out
where it came from.

40:15.148 --> 40:17.715
Time's running out,
probably already has.

40:17.717 --> 40:19.083
How much time do I have?

40:19.085 --> 40:21.852
I'd say, three, four days tops,

40:21.854 --> 40:23.721
but that's from the
time of infection.

40:23.723 --> 40:25.456
Okay, well, the
transfusion was on Tuesday,

40:25.458 --> 40:28.025
that means there's still time.

40:28.027 --> 40:28.959
I gotta go.

40:28.961 --> 40:30.161
I'm gonna be in touch.

40:30.163 --> 40:32.897
But I'm gonna find him!

40:34.167 --> 40:36.100
Patty regional hospital.

40:36.102 --> 40:37.735
Yeah, my son had
surgery there on Tuesday,

40:37.737 --> 40:40.204
who do I talk to about some
information off his records?

40:40.206 --> 40:40.204
What kind of information?

40:40.206 --> 40:45.543
I need ID numbers on
some blood he was given.

40:49.815 --> 40:50.981
Morgan.

40:50.983 --> 40:52.049
Hey Aaron.

40:52.051 --> 40:54.084
Listen, I need a big favor.

40:54.086 --> 40:55.186
What kind of favor?

40:55.188 --> 40:58.122
I need you to look up a donor.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.190
Can I help you?

42:06.192 --> 42:07.758
Hi, are you Abigail dasher?

42:07.760 --> 42:09.260
I am.

42:09.262 --> 42:11.529
Um, you donated blood
at the central blood bank?

42:11.531 --> 42:12.730
Sure did.

42:12.732 --> 42:14.565
Are you with the blood bank?

42:14.567 --> 42:15.933
Is there a problem?

42:15.935 --> 42:17.635
Uh, no, no, my son
actually got your blood,

42:17.637 --> 42:20.304
and I just wanted to thank you.

42:22.541 --> 42:23.607
Come in.

42:23.609 --> 42:25.809
Well thank you, so much.

42:25.811 --> 42:27.011
No, thank you!

42:27.013 --> 42:30.714
You don't know how
much that means to me.

42:31.716 --> 42:34.018
Can I get you some hot tea?

42:36.621 --> 42:38.022
Oh no no, I'm fine.

42:38.024 --> 42:40.324
Well at least let
me get you some water.

42:40.326 --> 42:41.326
Sure.

42:43.562 --> 42:45.996
Oh, please, sit down.

42:45.998 --> 42:46.998
Thanks.

42:48.199 --> 42:50.901
What was your name?

42:50.903 --> 42:51.903
Um, Miguel.

42:52.671 --> 42:55.039
Miguel, it's nice
to meet you Miguel.

42:55.041 --> 42:58.576
You know, I donate
about four times a year.

42:58.578 --> 43:01.745
I just don't understand
why everyone doesn't.

43:01.747 --> 43:04.615
We should all do our part.

43:04.617 --> 43:05.617
You know?

43:09.788 --> 43:11.922
So, how's your son doing?

43:13.124 --> 43:14.592
Well that's the thing.

43:14.594 --> 43:16.627
He's not doing so well.

43:16.629 --> 43:17.661
No?

43:17.663 --> 43:18.629
Is he in the hospital?

43:18.631 --> 43:19.964
No, he's home.

43:19.966 --> 43:21.865
That's good, I hope.

43:23.835 --> 43:27.004
Strange things have
been happening to him,

43:27.006 --> 43:31.241
and I wanted you to tell me if
you know anything about that.

43:31.243 --> 43:32.676
No.

43:32.678 --> 43:34.345
What strange things,
and how would I know?

43:34.347 --> 43:36.046
You know, just,

43:36.881 --> 43:38.315
just tell me.

43:38.317 --> 43:39.683
Admit it.

43:39.685 --> 43:40.718
I don't.

43:40.720 --> 43:42.186
I know about you.

43:42.188 --> 43:43.687
I know, Mrs. dasher,

43:43.689 --> 43:45.189
I know what you are.

43:45.191 --> 43:46.757
I don't understand.

43:46.759 --> 43:49.193
What I don't understand is why,

43:49.195 --> 43:51.295
Mrs. dasher, I mean, what is it?

43:51.297 --> 43:52.997
Is it some kind of game?

43:52.999 --> 43:54.898
Is it some sick Russian roulette

43:54.900 --> 43:57.134
where an innocent boy wins?

43:57.136 --> 43:59.403
I don't know what
you want me to say.

43:59.405 --> 44:01.071
I don't understand!

44:01.073 --> 44:02.073
Say it.

44:03.041 --> 44:04.742
I know.

44:04.744 --> 44:05.744
Go ahead.

44:06.344 --> 44:07.978
You're a...

44:07.980 --> 44:08.980
You're...

44:10.882 --> 44:12.750
You're a vampire.

44:12.752 --> 44:13.752
What?

44:15.854 --> 44:16.854
I know.

44:19.124 --> 44:21.692
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

44:21.694 --> 44:23.427
Can you just
give me an explanation?

44:23.429 --> 44:25.896
I want you out of my house.

44:29.167 --> 44:30.167
Please.

44:30.869 --> 44:32.770
Please, don't hurt me.

44:36.174 --> 44:38.308
I want you to prove it.

44:39.110 --> 44:40.678
What?

44:40.680 --> 44:42.312
Cut yourself.

44:42.314 --> 44:43.347
Why?

44:43.349 --> 44:45.315
You know why.

44:45.317 --> 44:46.684
I can't-

44:46.686 --> 44:49.053
- you do it or
I'll do it for you!

44:53.358 --> 44:54.725
Where?

44:54.727 --> 44:57.761
I don't care,
wherever I can see it.

44:57.763 --> 44:58.395
Do it!

44:58.397 --> 44:59.730
Okay, okay!

45:05.904 --> 45:07.371
No no, let me see it.

45:07.373 --> 45:08.806
Let me see it!

45:09.941 --> 45:13.444
What, do you want
me to bleed to death?

45:19.451 --> 45:22.352
My husband's gonna
be home any minute.

45:22.354 --> 45:23.354
Shut up!

45:37.469 --> 45:39.470
What are you doing?

45:42.240 --> 45:43.307
I'm sorry.

45:50.448 --> 45:51.849
I'm so so sorry.

47:05.223 --> 47:07.858
Dear Jesus, our lord and savior,

47:07.860 --> 47:10.460
divine physician,
healer of the sick,

47:10.462 --> 47:13.096
in Jesus Christ's name we pray.

47:14.032 --> 47:14.932
Amen.

47:14.934 --> 47:19.469
Do you mind if I have a
moment alone with Tate?

47:19.471 --> 47:21.071
Why?

47:21.073 --> 47:23.140
For one on one prayer.

47:25.343 --> 47:29.346
Do you mind if I have a
moment alone with Tate?

47:40.892 --> 47:41.625
Excuse me.

47:41.627 --> 47:43.327
Have you seen the priest?

47:43.329 --> 47:45.495
We haven't seen anyone.

47:45.497 --> 47:46.864
Hi, can I help you?

47:46.866 --> 47:48.932
Yes, uh, I need father Kane.

47:48.934 --> 47:49.900
Is he a patient?

47:49.902 --> 47:50.634
The chaplain.

47:50.636 --> 47:52.135
Oh, we have several of those.

47:52.137 --> 47:54.071
Let me check the
schedule for you.

47:54.073 --> 47:55.073
Sure.

47:56.307 --> 47:58.275
Looks like he's here just
a couple nights a week.

47:58.277 --> 48:01.645
All right, do you
have a phone number?

48:02.614 --> 48:04.514
I'm sorry I don't.

48:04.516 --> 48:08.285
It says here that we just
have his church address.

48:08.287 --> 48:09.419
Would you like that?

48:09.421 --> 48:10.421
Yes.

48:27.105 --> 48:28.105
Hello?

48:33.177 --> 48:34.177
Hello?

48:44.222 --> 48:45.222
Kane?

49:03.708 --> 49:05.008
Kane?

49:19.057 --> 49:21.625
It was a mistake on my part.

49:22.694 --> 49:23.727
Excuse me?

49:23.729 --> 49:25.595
A moment of sympathy,

49:25.597 --> 49:28.098
and, dare I say, weakness.

49:28.100 --> 49:30.667
Now what the hell is
that supposed to mean?

49:30.669 --> 49:33.270
You didn't want
to lose your son.

49:33.272 --> 49:34.438
He was dying.

49:35.440 --> 49:37.407
No, no he wasn't.

49:37.409 --> 49:39.142
I saw it.

49:39.144 --> 49:40.477
Death was near.

49:44.615 --> 49:46.083
That doesn't make any sense.

49:46.085 --> 49:47.384
He was at the hospital,
for Christ's sake,

49:47.386 --> 49:49.019
he was being monitored!

49:49.021 --> 49:50.654
His brain was bleeding.

49:50.656 --> 49:52.723
By the time they discovered it,

49:52.725 --> 49:54.725
it would have been too late.

49:54.727 --> 49:56.760
Why didn't you say something?

49:56.762 --> 49:59.429
Would you have believed me?

50:18.449 --> 50:20.650
So you turned
him into a monster.

50:20.652 --> 50:23.120
I don't see it that way,
and neither should you.

50:23.122 --> 50:24.254
How else should I see it?

50:24.256 --> 50:25.689
As a blessing.

50:25.691 --> 50:27.524
You have your son.

50:27.526 --> 50:31.094
He will be with you
for a long, long time.

50:39.771 --> 50:41.538
He wasn't dying.

50:43.641 --> 50:45.509
He wasn't, that's a lie.

50:45.511 --> 50:47.244
You're full of shit.

50:48.379 --> 50:51.081
After he gets his
first taste of blood,

50:51.083 --> 50:54.084
he will want it all the time.

50:54.086 --> 50:56.386
But he will learn to
control the hunger.

50:56.388 --> 50:58.822
He can get by with a
couple times a week,

50:58.824 --> 51:02.159
but he must feed
enough to stay healthy.

51:04.062 --> 51:06.396
If he doesn't, he will die.

51:09.167 --> 51:12.836
There are plenty of ways
to get it without violence.

51:12.838 --> 51:15.205
He will have questions.

51:15.207 --> 51:16.673
I'm here to help.

51:18.109 --> 51:19.643
It is my obligation.

51:35.527 --> 51:36.660
Yeah.

51:36.662 --> 51:37.828
I found him.

51:37.830 --> 51:39.463
Tell me what to do.

52:12.597 --> 52:14.898
Oh my god, what happened?

52:17.802 --> 52:19.136
It's getting better.

52:19.138 --> 52:20.537
Oh man, buddy.

52:22.673 --> 52:25.275
Here, let me see your wrist.

52:37.322 --> 52:38.322
Oh good.

52:39.891 --> 52:40.891
Dad.

52:42.560 --> 52:43.627
Yeah buddy.

52:43.629 --> 52:45.162
I'm scared.

52:45.164 --> 52:46.263
Yeah, I know.

52:49.934 --> 52:51.935
I don't trust myself.

52:53.504 --> 52:54.504
Why?

52:57.375 --> 52:58.608
I'm thirsty.

54:18.689 --> 54:20.957
You've gotta fix me, promise?

54:20.959 --> 54:22.993
You gotta make it
stop, promise me.

54:22.995 --> 54:24.995
Yeah Tate, I promise.

54:54.825 --> 54:55.825
Hello?

54:56.794 --> 54:57.794
Kane!

54:59.363 --> 55:02.399
Would you like to confess?

55:02.401 --> 55:06.403
Mrs. O'Leary, I'm here
to take your confession.

55:08.506 --> 55:09.506
Grammy?

55:15.980 --> 55:20.417
Oh lord Jesus Christ, who
died for us on the cross.

56:08.632 --> 56:09.933
Father Kane!

56:09.935 --> 56:12.435
Is there anything
else I can do for you?

56:12.437 --> 56:13.370
No, thanks.

56:13.372 --> 56:14.871
I appreciate you being here.

56:14.873 --> 56:16.639
What does last rites mean?

56:16.641 --> 56:19.609
Well that's a sacrament releasing
you from all punishment

56:19.611 --> 56:22.011
in this life, and
the life to come.

56:22.013 --> 56:24.948
Does it mean Grammy
will go to heaven?

56:24.950 --> 56:26.950
Well, most certainly.

56:26.952 --> 56:28.952
Okay, let's go, sweetie.

56:28.954 --> 56:30.754
Thanks again.

56:30.756 --> 56:32.389
It's my pleasure.

57:39.490 --> 57:41.491
Code blue in room 239.

57:41.493 --> 57:42.692
It's Mrs. O'Leary.

57:42.694 --> 57:43.927
She has a DNR.

58:07.852 --> 58:09.219
I'm about to start dinner.

58:09.221 --> 58:11.521
You still like Mac 'n cheese?

58:11.523 --> 58:14.491
It's okay, I'm not hungry.

58:14.493 --> 58:15.124
You sure?

58:15.126 --> 58:16.593
Yeah.

58:16.595 --> 58:18.127
Well, I'm gonna
make some anyway,

58:18.129 --> 58:19.496
just in case.

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:07.904
I have questions.

01:00:09.607 --> 01:00:11.074
So, why a priest?

01:00:12.743 --> 01:00:14.344
That's all I knew.

01:00:14.346 --> 01:00:17.013
I was a priest before,
and so I remained.

01:00:17.015 --> 01:00:17.947
Huh.

01:00:17.949 --> 01:00:19.816
I don't know, it's a little-

01:00:19.818 --> 01:00:21.351
- ironic?

01:00:21.353 --> 01:00:22.352
Yeah.

01:00:22.354 --> 01:00:24.621
It works for my survival.

01:00:24.623 --> 01:00:27.724
And it's more common
than you might think.

01:00:30.095 --> 01:00:33.763
Actually, excuse me,
I have to take this.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.066
Yeah.

01:00:37.068 --> 01:00:38.735
Is Tate with you?

01:00:38.737 --> 01:00:40.269
No, why?

01:00:40.271 --> 01:00:43.406
I've looked everywhere
for him, I can't find him.

01:00:43.408 --> 01:00:45.675
Uh, I'm sure he's fine.

01:00:45.677 --> 01:00:47.310
I'll be there soon.

01:01:18.275 --> 01:01:20.410
So um, the whole cross thing.

01:01:20.412 --> 01:01:22.445
I'm guessing that's not true.

01:01:22.447 --> 01:01:24.047
One of the misconceptions.

01:01:24.049 --> 01:01:26.816
I'm not sure where
that one came from.

01:01:26.818 --> 01:01:28.217
Misconceptions.

01:01:28.219 --> 01:01:29.952
What others are there?

01:01:29.954 --> 01:01:32.855
Well, I don't sleep in a coffin.

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:37.694
And, flying?

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:39.862
Well.

01:01:42.733 --> 01:01:46.803
And living forever,
that's not a myth?

01:01:46.805 --> 01:01:47.970
Forever.

01:01:47.972 --> 01:01:50.206
How can anyone be sure?

01:01:50.208 --> 01:01:52.041
How old are you?

01:01:52.043 --> 01:01:52.875
Not old.

01:01:52.877 --> 01:01:54.711
I was born in 1908.

01:01:55.913 --> 01:02:00.049
So, this means that
Tate's never gonna grow up?

01:02:01.485 --> 01:02:05.855
Well, if you mean
his physical body, no.

01:02:05.857 --> 01:02:09.058
Well how are we supposed
to deal with that?

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:10.827
We'll figure it out.

01:02:10.829 --> 01:02:14.130
One day at a time, just
like the prayer says.

01:02:14.132 --> 01:02:17.734
Lord, give me the strength
I need to face today.

01:02:17.736 --> 01:02:19.302
What prayer is that?

01:02:19.304 --> 01:02:22.939
Prayer for strength,
one of my favorites.

01:02:23.874 --> 01:02:25.742
I need to know something.

01:02:25.744 --> 01:02:26.744
Okay.

01:02:28.812 --> 01:02:32.248
Have you ever killed
innocent people?

01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:34.383
Why must you know that?

01:02:35.452 --> 01:02:39.088
Just trying to figure
out what to expect.

01:02:40.858 --> 01:02:44.827
Nobody's completely
innocent, are they?

01:02:44.829 --> 01:02:46.462
So you have, right?

01:02:48.065 --> 01:02:49.298
Not anymore.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.307
I wanna hear it.

01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:59.308
What?

01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:02.145
The prayer for strength.

01:03:02.147 --> 01:03:03.147
Oh, okay.

01:03:04.248 --> 01:03:08.117
Oh lord, you are holy
above all others.

01:03:08.119 --> 01:03:09.051
No, no.

01:03:09.053 --> 01:03:11.287
I want you to pray with me.

01:03:12.189 --> 01:03:13.189
Okay.

01:03:20.531 --> 01:03:23.866
Oh lord, you are holy
above all others,

01:03:23.868 --> 01:03:27.103
and all the strength we
need is in your hands.

01:03:27.105 --> 01:03:31.574
We do not ask, oh lord, that
you take this trial away.

01:03:31.576 --> 01:03:35.812
Instead we ask that your
will be done in our lives.

01:03:39.016 --> 01:03:41.017
Aaron, hold him down.

01:03:42.953 --> 01:03:44.120
Stand on him!

01:03:45.556 --> 01:03:46.956
Hold it up.

01:03:48.859 --> 01:03:50.960
Ah, that's terrible.

01:03:51.962 --> 01:03:53.930
You sure this is gonna work?

01:03:53.932 --> 01:03:55.164
No promises.

01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:56.999
Hello?

01:03:57.001 --> 01:03:58.434
Hey, did you find him?

01:03:58.436 --> 01:03:59.602
No.

01:04:01.238 --> 01:04:02.238
Aaron?

01:04:06.045 --> 01:04:06.944
Aaron!

01:04:06.945 --> 01:04:11.914
Uh, just stay there and
call me if he shows up.

01:04:24.261 --> 01:04:25.261
Mom?

01:04:31.568 --> 01:04:32.568
Mom.

01:04:50.555 --> 01:04:52.054
Honey, what's wrong?

01:04:52.056 --> 01:04:54.891
It's this kid from
school, he's out there!

01:04:54.893 --> 01:04:56.659
No, he's coming after me!

01:04:56.661 --> 01:05:00.997
He's a demon, call for
help, he's coming after me!

01:05:00.999 --> 01:05:02.064
Stay right there.

01:05:02.066 --> 01:05:03.066
No!

01:05:04.635 --> 01:05:05.635
Tate!

01:05:07.671 --> 01:05:08.971
Tate!

01:05:10.007 --> 01:05:11.007
Tate!

01:05:26.023 --> 01:05:27.023
Oh my god.

01:05:27.025 --> 01:05:29.525
Tate, where have you been?

01:05:29.527 --> 01:05:30.660
Are you okay?

01:05:31.595 --> 01:05:33.696
You should stay away from me.

01:05:33.698 --> 01:05:36.198
What are you talking about?

01:05:37.968 --> 01:05:40.002
Come inside, come on.

01:05:40.938 --> 01:05:42.438
Where did you go?

01:05:47.044 --> 01:05:50.613
Well do you know
where he might be?

01:05:50.615 --> 01:05:52.949
Okay, listen, I gotta go.

01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:54.550
Yeah.

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:57.486
Okay.

01:05:57.488 --> 01:05:59.255
Listen to me, I'm
gonna be right there,

01:05:59.257 --> 01:06:01.958
don't you let him go anywhere.

01:06:18.008 --> 01:06:19.108
Evening, officers.

01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:20.309
What's going on?

01:06:20.311 --> 01:06:21.177
Aaron Diaz?

01:06:21.179 --> 01:06:22.611
Yeah.

01:06:22.613 --> 01:06:24.447
Where were you between
three and four this afternoon?

01:06:24.449 --> 01:06:26.182
Um, why do you ask?

01:06:26.184 --> 01:06:28.017
He was with me.

01:06:28.019 --> 01:06:29.986
And where was your car?

01:06:29.988 --> 01:06:31.687
I had it with me all day.

01:06:31.689 --> 01:06:34.423
Do you know an Abigail dasher?

01:06:35.659 --> 01:06:36.492
No.

01:06:36.494 --> 01:06:36.492
No, I don't think so.

01:06:36.494 --> 01:06:39.295
Were you driving in the
Bella vista neighborhood

01:06:39.297 --> 01:06:42.264
at any time, Montclair street?

01:06:42.266 --> 01:06:43.499
No.

01:06:43.501 --> 01:06:45.401
Sir, Abigail dasher
says a man attacked her

01:06:45.403 --> 01:06:47.103
this afternoon at her home.

01:06:47.105 --> 01:06:48.471
A man fitting your description,

01:06:48.473 --> 01:06:50.439
in your car, with
your license plate.

01:06:50.441 --> 01:06:52.675
Oh no, that's
gotta be a mistake.

01:06:52.677 --> 01:06:54.276
I think she has the wrong car.

01:06:54.278 --> 01:06:56.045
I don't think so.

01:06:56.047 --> 01:06:58.714
See, she took a photo
of you, driving away,

01:06:58.716 --> 01:07:00.683
and it's indeed your car.

01:07:00.685 --> 01:07:03.753
I can show you the
photo if you like.

01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:06.055
Sir, can you turn around

01:07:06.057 --> 01:07:08.791
and put your hands
behind your back?

01:07:08.793 --> 01:07:11.127
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:07:11.129 --> 01:07:12.129
Hey!

01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:15.131
I said he was with me.

01:07:23.173 --> 01:07:26.275
Do you have any idea what
the penalty is for this?

01:07:26.277 --> 01:07:28.677
I'm guessing it's a doozy.

01:07:30.047 --> 01:07:32.114
Tell me, do you have any kids?

01:07:32.116 --> 01:07:34.116
It's none of your business.

01:07:34.118 --> 01:07:36.085
How about you?

01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:40.289
Yeah, two.

01:07:40.291 --> 01:07:45.227
Is there anything you
wouldn't do for them?

01:07:46.063 --> 01:07:47.296
No.

01:07:47.298 --> 01:07:50.066
What does that have
to do with anything?

01:07:50.068 --> 01:07:54.203
He's just a guy trying
to save his son, is all.

01:07:55.172 --> 01:07:55.805
Where is he?

01:07:55.807 --> 01:07:56.839
Bedroom.

01:07:56.841 --> 01:07:59.241
I need your blender.

01:07:59.243 --> 01:08:00.076
Okay.

01:08:00.078 --> 01:08:01.177
Now!

01:08:08.819 --> 01:08:10.119
Hey bud.

01:08:11.121 --> 01:08:12.221
Hey dad.

01:08:13.857 --> 01:08:15.257
You okay?

01:08:21.665 --> 01:08:23.198
Where were you?

01:08:24.134 --> 01:08:25.334
I was thirsty.

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:31.407
Look, it's gonna be all right.

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:34.443
I didn't do anything.

01:08:34.444 --> 01:08:35.411
I couldn't.

01:08:35.412 --> 01:08:37.279
I can't kill again.

01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:40.683
I wanna die.

01:08:42.452 --> 01:08:44.220
And you have to kill me.

01:08:44.221 --> 01:08:44.854
Hey.

01:08:44.856 --> 01:08:44.854
Please!

01:08:44.856 --> 01:08:47.857
Stop, stop, no, don't say that.

01:08:47.859 --> 01:08:48.691
Please!

01:08:48.693 --> 01:08:50.225
Look, listen to me.

01:08:50.228 --> 01:08:52.261
Listen, I found something.

01:08:58.535 --> 01:09:00.502
What is that,
what are you doing?

01:09:00.505 --> 01:09:02.770
Listen, Tate
caught something bad.

01:09:02.773 --> 01:09:05.207
I'm doing everything I
can to make it better.

01:09:05.209 --> 01:09:06.742
Is that blood?

01:09:06.743 --> 01:09:08.144
Yeah.

01:09:08.145 --> 01:09:09.812
Where did you get it?

01:09:09.814 --> 01:09:11.212
Doesn't matter.

01:09:11.215 --> 01:09:13.215
What are you gonna do with it?

01:09:13.216 --> 01:09:14.817
It's for Tate.

01:09:14.819 --> 01:09:17.185
Would you tell
me what's going on?

01:09:17.188 --> 01:09:19.488
I need you to
trust me right now.

01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:21.924
And promise me that no
matter what happens,

01:09:21.926 --> 01:09:24.260
Tate and I are gonna
have your support.

01:09:24.261 --> 01:09:27.263
Of course, you know that.

01:09:27.265 --> 01:09:28.265
Okay.

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.439
Is this gonna work?

01:09:39.643 --> 01:09:40.709
Is has to.

01:09:47.884 --> 01:09:49.885
You need to drink this.

01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:52.288
It stinks.

01:09:52.290 --> 01:09:55.958
I know, just do it fast.

01:10:14.778 --> 01:10:15.778
Now what?

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:17.947
I don't know.

01:10:17.949 --> 01:10:19.949
I guess we just wait.

01:10:47.377 --> 01:10:48.611
Hey Vaughn.

01:10:48.613 --> 01:10:50.512
You wanna bet how
long it takes dispatch

01:10:50.514 --> 01:10:52.348
to send someone to
come look for us?

01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:53.350
How much?

01:10:54.284 --> 01:10:55.684
Hundred bucks?

01:11:01.658 --> 01:11:02.858
Who are you?

01:11:04.027 --> 01:11:06.362
We could use some help.

01:11:12.302 --> 01:11:13.302
What the?

01:11:16.673 --> 01:11:17.673
Hey!

01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:23.545
Help, help!

01:11:26.016 --> 01:11:27.316

01:11:41.731 --> 01:11:43.499
Get me out of here!

01:11:43.501 --> 01:11:45.334
Get me out of here!

01:11:46.603 --> 01:11:47.603
No!

01:12:10.527 --> 01:12:11.527
Tate?

01:12:13.797 --> 01:12:14.797
Tate.

01:12:17.567 --> 01:12:18.701
Tate?

01:12:18.703 --> 01:12:19.703
Tate?

01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:22.404
Tater, come on.

01:12:24.374 --> 01:12:25.774
Oh my god, Tate!

01:12:26.576 --> 01:12:28.344
Tate!

01:12:28.346 --> 01:12:30.612
Tate, tater, talk to me Tate.

01:12:31.414 --> 01:12:32.481
Tater.

01:12:32.483 --> 01:12:34.483
Don't call me that.

01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:37.953
Get away from me.

01:12:37.955 --> 01:12:39.021
Oh my god.

01:12:44.427 --> 01:12:46.795
Oh my god, what's happening?

01:12:47.897 --> 01:12:49.098
Karen!

01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:50.599
Please, you need
to get out of here.

01:12:50.601 --> 01:12:51.934
Karen.

01:12:51.936 --> 01:12:52.936
Tate.

01:12:53.737 --> 01:12:56.138
Come on, Tate, come back to me.

01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:57.439
Tate.

01:13:02.412 --> 01:13:03.512
No!

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:09.718
Oh my god.

01:13:17.527 --> 01:13:20.496
Oh my god, I don't
know what to do.

01:13:31.174 --> 01:13:32.174
Oh, buddy.

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:11.780
Hey, dad.

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:19.621
Bud?

01:14:19.623 --> 01:14:21.023
What happened?

01:14:44.914 --> 01:14:46.014
Well?

01:14:46.016 --> 01:14:47.716
Hey, it worked.

01:14:47.718 --> 01:14:49.218
Glad to hear it.

01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:50.886
I don't know how to thank you.

01:14:50.888 --> 01:14:52.521
Don't worry about it.

01:14:52.523 --> 01:14:54.256
Tell him that it's all my fault.

01:14:54.258 --> 01:14:56.492
Okay, that I just
forced you into it.

01:14:56.494 --> 01:14:58.760
No worries, they
ain't coming after you.

01:14:58.762 --> 01:15:01.263
I'll take the blame,
I will, all of it.

01:15:01.265 --> 01:15:03.232
They ain't coming
after me, either.

01:15:03.234 --> 01:15:04.900
Why?

01:15:04.902 --> 01:15:06.168
We got a plan.

01:15:06.170 --> 01:15:08.270
Just remember, you were with me.

01:15:08.272 --> 01:15:10.606
What happened?

01:15:10.608 --> 01:15:13.242
You didn't cut Mike's
head off like I told you to,

01:15:13.244 --> 01:15:14.710
that's what happened.

01:15:14.712 --> 01:15:16.111
Oh yeah, I know.

01:15:16.113 --> 01:15:18.013
I couldn't, I'm sorry.

01:15:19.916 --> 01:15:21.683
Oh my god, did he?

01:15:22.685 --> 01:15:23.952
It's all good.

01:15:23.954 --> 01:15:26.088
We got it all worked out.
