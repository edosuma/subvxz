right next to Hodges

34:57.182 --> 35:00.794
the same week
as the attack on Jim Brass.

35:03.927 --> 35:05.973
Gil.

35:13.285 --> 35:15.939
Argiope trifasciata.

35:17.289 --> 35:20.205
Takes about three weeks
for a banded garden spider's

35:20.248 --> 35:22.294
egg sac to
get this big.

35:22.337 --> 35:25.471
Then the ground here wasn't
dug up to plant this bush.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.170
What kind of person kills a dog

35:29.214 --> 35:31.999
and then plants it
in their owner's driveway?

35:32.042 --> 35:34.828
The kind that wants
to break into a house

35:34.871 --> 35:36.960
without drawing attention
maybe.

35:37.004 --> 35:39.311
Hmm, you don't have
to say I was right.

35:41.226 --> 35:43.097
We're gonna need a shovel.

35:49.103 --> 35:51.192
♪

35:51.236 --> 35:53.151
Here we go.

35:57.590 --> 35:59.896
Looks like a match.On the surface.

35:59.940 --> 36:02.247
I want to go deeper.

36:06.251 --> 36:08.383
What is that?

36:08.427 --> 36:09.993
I could ask the same thing.

36:10.037 --> 36:12.213
This? This is a dead dog.

36:12.257 --> 36:13.432
SIDLE:
German Shepherd named Brewski.

36:13.475 --> 36:14.650
He needs to be necropsied

36:14.694 --> 36:16.130
for the David Hodges case.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.741
Possibly. For now,
it's an unrelated matter.

36:18.785 --> 36:20.482
Well, Brewski's gonna have

36:20.526 --> 36:21.875
to get in line
'cause we got a dead person

36:21.918 --> 36:23.268
in front of him.

36:23.311 --> 36:24.573
And we're about to
do some alternate

36:24.617 --> 36:26.532
light photography.

36:26.575 --> 36:28.229
Did you build this yourself?I did.

36:28.273 --> 36:29.796
Actually with Hugo's help.

36:29.839 --> 36:32.494
Oh, yeah, you're
Doc Robbins' protégé?

36:32.538 --> 36:33.800
I hear you paint.

36:33.843 --> 36:35.193
I-I do.

36:35.236 --> 36:37.064
The improvement's

36:37.107 --> 36:39.371
in the spectral transmission
of the orange filter.

36:39.414 --> 36:41.199
Blocks out 99.9%

36:41.242 --> 36:43.592
of all light over

36:43.636 --> 36:46.421
400 nanometers.GRISSOM: So you must
be able to detect

36:46.465 --> 36:48.031
deeper subdermal bruising.

36:48.075 --> 36:49.294
That's inspired.

36:49.337 --> 36:51.252
It's a step up
from that old black light.

36:51.296 --> 36:54.124
Get the light, get the light.Uh, lights!

37:02.045 --> 37:04.613
This...

37:04.657 --> 37:06.267
this is weird.

37:06.311 --> 37:07.964
I'd say it's clarifying.

37:08.008 --> 37:09.662
That's where the killer's
weight came down.

37:11.881 --> 37:14.710
Meaning what? The ball of the
foot was in the shoe's arch?

37:14.754 --> 37:18.236
So whoever did this
wore big boots.

37:18.279 --> 37:20.412
They didn't necessarily
have big feet.

37:20.455 --> 37:22.501
ROBY:
Nope.

37:22.544 --> 37:25.243
[grunting]

37:26.418 --> 37:28.463
She's a pretty little thing.

37:33.816 --> 37:36.471
You people are
ridiculous.

37:36.515 --> 37:37.559
[sighs]

37:56.535 --> 37:57.971
Hmm.

37:58.014 --> 38:00.408
So, uh...

38:01.670 --> 38:04.804
What'd you say
that top color was, Christy?

38:04.847 --> 38:06.066
Wicked Fierce?

38:06.109 --> 38:08.634
Yeah.And the one underneath?

38:08.677 --> 38:10.462
Cool Blue Shimmer.

38:10.505 --> 38:13.073
Well, we found something between
them called "gunshot residue."

38:13.116 --> 38:14.901
I didn't hurt Nate and Jinny.

38:14.944 --> 38:16.337
No, you killed them
on their wedding day.

38:16.381 --> 38:19.079
Mr. Hassan--Whoa, whoa,
whoa, come on.

38:19.122 --> 38:21.995
Hassan wasn't pulling the
strings here-- what do they say?

38:22.038 --> 38:23.953
There's no man
strong as a woman inside.

38:23.997 --> 38:25.738
You were running the business.

38:25.781 --> 38:27.870
Ah, both businesses.Mm-hmm.

38:27.914 --> 38:29.524
The club.

38:29.568 --> 38:31.918
Mm-hmm.And...

38:31.961 --> 38:33.572
a blackmail scheme

38:33.615 --> 38:35.835
at the center of it.

38:35.878 --> 38:37.315
ROBY:
Money was pouring in

38:37.358 --> 38:38.664
for years.

38:38.707 --> 38:40.796
Nobody was late on a payment.

38:40.840 --> 38:42.624
People were afraid

38:42.668 --> 38:46.498
of Anwar Hassan.

38:46.541 --> 38:48.978
Until he had a stroke.

38:49.022 --> 38:51.198
You can't rule

38:51.241 --> 38:53.722
with an iron fist
when you can't even make a fist.

38:53.766 --> 38:56.029
And he does a pretty good job
hiding it.

38:56.072 --> 38:57.378
You do, too.

38:57.422 --> 38:59.337
What did he tell you?Nothing.

38:59.380 --> 39:01.556
He didn't have to-- see, I love

39:01.600 --> 39:03.602
forensic kinesiology.

39:03.645 --> 39:06.169
And Nate and Jinny were doctors,

39:06.213 --> 39:09.042
so they probably diagnosed
Hassan's condition right away.

39:09.085 --> 39:11.218
CARSON:
They knew he was weak,

39:11.261 --> 39:13.176
so they made a move, right?

39:13.220 --> 39:17.050
ROBY:
Out of all the blackmail photos
my team recovered,

39:17.093 --> 39:20.009
none were
of Nate Kestler or Jinny Lee.

39:20.053 --> 39:22.403
They wriggled out
from under Hassan's thumb

39:22.447 --> 39:24.492
and they took
the club's G-Wagen with them.

39:24.536 --> 39:25.841
I can't say I blame 'em.

39:25.885 --> 39:27.365
The car's only worth half

39:27.408 --> 39:28.844
of what you stole from them.

39:28.888 --> 39:30.411
And you wouldn't even
let that stand.

39:30.455 --> 39:32.152
You think I killed
two people over a car

39:32.195 --> 39:33.893
I don't even own?
No.

39:33.936 --> 39:36.504
You killed two people
to send a message

39:36.548 --> 39:39.507
to a man
with much deeper pockets.

39:39.551 --> 39:42.423
CARSON:
Tyler Clement's been paying you

39:42.467 --> 39:44.382
a lot of blackmail
over the years.

39:44.425 --> 39:46.340
Millions, all told.
Mm-hmm.

39:46.384 --> 39:49.038
Nate Kestler told
his friend he could stop.

39:49.082 --> 39:51.432
That Hassan wasn't anyone
to be feared.

39:51.476 --> 39:53.086
And you wanted him
to fall back in line.

39:53.129 --> 39:55.262
So you showed him this.

39:55.305 --> 39:58.221
And it worked.

39:58.265 --> 40:00.920
All of a sudden,
Tyler started paying again.

40:00.963 --> 40:02.748
This whole thing
was a show

40:02.791 --> 40:05.141
for an audience of one.

40:06.186 --> 40:08.928
Do swingers have
a name for that?

40:08.971 --> 40:11.147
[chuckles]

40:11.191 --> 40:13.454
That's good.

40:13.498 --> 40:15.282
Smile for the camera.

40:21.070 --> 40:24.726
And then she was like,
"Smile for the camera."

40:24.770 --> 40:27.076
Was that your American accent?

40:27.120 --> 40:30.079
Yeah, I think it beats
your British.

40:31.690 --> 40:33.605
Where you headed?Um...

40:33.648 --> 40:35.476
Mark's... home.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.435
Where I live.
[short laugh]

40:37.478 --> 40:39.480
Have a good night.

40:41.351 --> 40:43.441
Yeah, you, too.

40:46.792 --> 40:49.185
Can someone please explain
to me how this poor animal

40:49.229 --> 40:51.057
ended up in my morgue?

40:51.100 --> 40:52.406
Well, the necropsy
confirmed that someone

40:52.450 --> 40:53.755
crushed the dog's skull.

40:53.799 --> 40:56.149
But Brewski was
a good boy.

40:56.192 --> 40:57.933
He bit his killer
before he died.

40:57.977 --> 40:59.718
We found blood on his teeth.

40:59.761 --> 41:01.589
We need to test it.

41:01.633 --> 41:03.722
And what's stopping you is...?

41:03.765 --> 41:06.986
The chief justice and attorney
general of the state of Nevada.

41:07.029 --> 41:10.032
The sheriff of Clark County
and all your other bosses.

41:10.076 --> 41:12.121
That dog lived next door
to David Hodges.

41:12.165 --> 41:15.081
We found a mass of blowfly pupa

41:15.124 --> 41:17.257
in the cadaver.

41:17.300 --> 41:19.085
It puts the time of death

41:19.128 --> 41:20.303
precisely
one week ago.

41:20.347 --> 41:22.131
SIDLE:
So just three days

41:22.175 --> 41:23.785
before we entered
that storage space,

41:23.829 --> 41:25.395
an intruder
encountered

41:25.439 --> 41:27.441
this guard dog
next to a garage where many

41:27.485 --> 41:29.008
of David Hodges'
personal effects

41:29.051 --> 41:31.140
were being stored.

41:31.184 --> 41:33.273
Max...

41:33.316 --> 41:35.754
this is how they framed him.

41:37.886 --> 41:39.888
I have to disagree.

41:39.932 --> 41:43.022
This is
totally unrelated

41:43.065 --> 41:45.459
to the David Hodges case,
but...

41:45.503 --> 41:47.548
I agree with you.

41:47.592 --> 41:49.507
This case of animal cruelty,

41:49.550 --> 41:51.421
I mean,
it warrants

41:51.465 --> 41:53.598
some investigation.

41:53.641 --> 41:56.296
At least we can agree on that.

41:56.339 --> 41:58.080
ROBY:
Yeah, and as you know,

41:58.124 --> 41:59.995
from time to time,
the crime lab

42:00.039 --> 42:01.780
employs consultants.

42:01.823 --> 42:04.565
And I think we could use
an entomological adviser

42:04.609 --> 42:06.524
on this new case.

42:06.567 --> 42:08.787
Dr. Grissom?

42:08.830 --> 42:12.268
Do you think I could persuade
you to come back to CSI?
