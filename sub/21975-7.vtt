WEBVTT

00:00.484 --> 00:05.736
All right, William, you sit
over there in that seat.

00:05.769 --> 00:08.205
Hey, Bill.

00:08.238 --> 00:09.439
How you doing?

00:09.473 --> 00:11.475
Oh, hanging out.

00:11.508 --> 00:15.045
God, getting ready for
the Arkansas football season.

00:15.078 --> 00:18.482
In 2015, as part of
a "Nathan for You" DVD release,

00:18.515 --> 00:20.350
Comedy Central asked me

00:20.384 --> 00:22.152
to record an audio commentary track

00:22.186 --> 00:24.221
for some of my favorite episodes.

00:24.254 --> 00:27.090
In one segment, I helped
a struggling souvenir shop

00:27.124 --> 00:29.293
and in the process

00:29.326 --> 00:31.762
met a professional Bill Gates
impersonator named Bill Heath.

00:31.795 --> 00:35.032
When we started our computers...

00:36.533 --> 00:38.769
back in the '80s,

00:38.802 --> 00:40.804
it was huge...

00:40.838 --> 00:44.341
in the business,
they were huge machines.

00:44.374 --> 00:46.243
I found him to be
a really interesting person,

00:46.276 --> 00:49.079
so when it came time
to record the commentary

00:49.112 --> 00:51.181
for his episode,
I invited him to join us

00:51.215 --> 00:54.117
and share his favorite memories
from making the show.

00:54.151 --> 00:57.187
Yeah, the owner of the shop,

00:57.221 --> 00:59.923
I came in... I was explaining to him

00:59.957 --> 01:03.026
about how the computers were founded

01:03.060 --> 01:04.995
when we founded them and so forth.

01:05.028 --> 01:06.930
But during the recording

01:06.964 --> 01:09.032
Bill's attention seemed scattered.

01:09.066 --> 01:12.336
He not only took a seven-minute
call from his phone company...

01:12.369 --> 01:14.538
Right, people were posting
about the event on Twitter.

01:14.571 --> 01:17.140
Yes, I want to lower the rate.

01:17.174 --> 01:19.009
How long will it be?

01:19.042 --> 01:20.944
William, who is... who is on the phone?

01:20.978 --> 01:22.546
ATT. Yeah, what's your number?

01:22.579 --> 01:24.882
I'm gonna call you back
on this promotion.

01:24.915 --> 01:26.216
But he also went into detail

01:26.250 --> 01:28.485
about a long-lost love from his past,

01:28.519 --> 01:30.888
a woman named Frances Gaddy.

01:30.921 --> 01:33.023
I should have married her,
everybody interfered.

01:33.056 --> 01:34.825
Who interfered?

01:34.858 --> 01:37.094
Oh, my mother, you know,
a lot of friends.

01:37.127 --> 01:40.063
They... they... you know, mothers,
a lot of mothers

01:40.097 --> 01:41.932
have picked out the girl
they want you to marry.

01:41.965 --> 01:45.402
Well, it doesn't work that way.

01:45.435 --> 01:48.038
Is that a regret of yours?

01:48.071 --> 01:50.374
It's one of 'em, yeah, I look back.

01:50.407 --> 01:53.310
I should have married her.

01:55.279 --> 01:56.947
I don't know where she is now.

01:56.980 --> 01:59.116
I've been trying to find her.

01:59.149 --> 02:00.851
I didn't think much of it at the time,

02:00.884 --> 02:02.452
but as the months went on,

02:02.486 --> 02:04.588
Bill began to show up
at the office unannounced

02:04.621 --> 02:05.589
to deliver gifts...

02:05.622 --> 02:06.957
Oh, it's a serving set.

02:06.990 --> 02:08.058
Yeah.

02:08.091 --> 02:09.293
Grab a quick snack,

02:09.326 --> 02:11.328
or just to hang out,

02:11.361 --> 02:13.263
and the name Frances Gaddy
kept coming up.

02:14.238 --> 02:18.363
_

02:19.970 --> 02:23.073
Thoughts of this failed romance
from over 50 years ago

02:23.106 --> 02:24.441
seemed to completely consume him.

02:24.478 --> 02:27.510
_

02:27.578 --> 02:29.279
Frances? I don't know.

02:29.313 --> 02:30.881
Can I use the bathroom quickly,

02:30.914 --> 02:31.548
and then we'll talk when I come out?

02:31.582 --> 02:33.884
- Sure.
- Okay.

02:33.917 --> 02:35.919
And in getting to know him,
I began to understand why.

02:35.953 --> 02:37.454
At the age of 78,

02:37.487 --> 02:40.123
Bill lived alone and had never married.

02:40.157 --> 02:43.327
His closest bond was with
his alma mater's football team,

02:43.360 --> 02:44.995
the Arkansas Razorbacks.

02:45.028 --> 02:47.998
Each year I give $3,000 total

02:48.031 --> 02:52.135
for the Arkansas Razorbacks
athletic programs.

02:52.169 --> 02:55.038
Whoo, pigs! Sooey!

02:55.072 --> 02:57.875
Razorbacks! Number one.

02:57.908 --> 03:00.611
His lifestyle was modest
and very organized.

03:00.644 --> 03:03.614
This is a stack of loan offers.

03:03.647 --> 03:08.018
RISE preapproved for $2,600.

03:08.051 --> 03:11.121
Here's the same RISE for $5,000.

03:11.154 --> 03:15.926
$1,000 prequalified,
in your account $2,500.

03:15.959 --> 03:18.929
With such meticulous record
keeping in his daily life,

03:18.962 --> 03:21.999
it was surprising that he had
no information about Frances

03:22.032 --> 03:23.467
other than her name.

03:23.500 --> 03:24.935
Have you looked for her? I mean...

03:24.968 --> 03:28.539
I tried once or twice, yeah.

03:28.572 --> 03:31.208
An exhaustive Internet search
turned up nothing.

03:31.241 --> 03:33.277
If she had married someone,

03:33.310 --> 03:35.379
it was likely she'd have
a different last name.

03:35.412 --> 03:39.082
And that meant with over
600,000 women named Frances

03:39.116 --> 03:41.385
currently living in the U.S.,

03:41.418 --> 03:44.054
the task of finding
the one Bill was looking for

03:44.087 --> 03:46.623
would take an incredible amount
of time and effort.

03:46.657 --> 03:49.526
But the challenge of solving
a near-impossible mystery

03:49.560 --> 03:51.228
intrigued me.

03:51.261 --> 03:53.530
Plus, there was something about
an old man

03:53.564 --> 03:56.400
so filled with regret that was
hard for me to ignore,

03:56.433 --> 03:59.436
and I realized
if I didn't help him do this,

03:59.469 --> 04:03.407
no one would.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.074

<font color="#fff00">Corrected & Synced by Bakugan</font>

04:18.454 --> 04:20.958
It was becoming clear
that finding this woman

04:20.991 --> 04:23.427
would take a lot more effort
than a Google search.

04:23.460 --> 04:25.395
But before devoting my time to this,

04:25.429 --> 04:28.265
I wanted to see what
Bill's motivations were.

04:28.298 --> 04:32.135
Oh, I need to confess
a lot of things to her

04:32.169 --> 04:35.272
about what... between the time we...

04:35.305 --> 04:38.575
the lapse of time and fill in the gaps,

04:38.609 --> 04:41.345
her gaps and my gaps,

04:41.378 --> 04:43.647
to put the puzzle together.

04:43.680 --> 04:47.251
I mean, a best-case scenario,
what do you hope will happen?

04:47.284 --> 04:49.319
Well, I hope I can find her.

04:49.353 --> 04:51.088
And then what?
What happens when you find her?

04:51.121 --> 04:52.990
Well, I'll go from there.

04:53.023 --> 04:55.225
Well, what does that mean?

04:55.259 --> 04:57.995
Well, if she's married,

04:58.028 --> 05:00.364
you have to accept it that way.

05:00.397 --> 05:02.466
But if she's not?

05:02.499 --> 05:05.035
If she's not, well,
maybe we could get married...

05:06.570 --> 05:09.573
finally.

05:09.606 --> 05:11.575
You still love her?

05:11.608 --> 05:13.477
Yeah, I do.

05:13.510 --> 05:16.613
I was moved by how
romantic of a tale this was.

05:16.647 --> 05:19.516
Love it hard to come by, you know.

05:19.550 --> 05:21.318
The possibility of reuniting Bill

05:21.351 --> 05:24.354
with his long-lost love was so cool.

05:24.388 --> 05:26.490
So I told him I had some good news.

05:26.523 --> 05:29.526
I want to use the resources of my show

05:29.560 --> 05:31.562
to help you find Frances.

05:31.595 --> 05:34.631
Well, that's...

05:36.767 --> 05:40.170
I think that's a true friend
that would do that.

05:40.204 --> 05:42.739
But Bill hadn't seen
or spoken to Frances

05:42.773 --> 05:44.541
in over 50 years,

05:44.575 --> 05:46.610
leaving us with very little to go on.

05:46.643 --> 05:48.178
You know, she married on the rebound,

05:48.212 --> 05:51.548
unhappy marriage, she got a divorce,

05:51.582 --> 05:54.551
and I think she got another
divorce, I don't know.

05:54.585 --> 05:56.453
So wait, who did she marry?

05:56.486 --> 05:59.423
Charles something.
I don't remember his last name.

05:59.456 --> 06:00.524
She married a Charles.

06:00.557 --> 06:02.059
Yes.

06:02.092 --> 06:03.293
But she could be married again?

06:03.327 --> 06:04.628
- She could be.
- You just don't know.

06:04.661 --> 06:06.363
I don't know.

06:06.396 --> 06:08.165
The only thing he did know for sure

06:08.198 --> 06:10.067
was her name before she was married

06:10.100 --> 06:12.636
and what she looked like in 1961.

06:12.669 --> 06:15.506
Brown hair, brown eyes.

06:15.539 --> 06:18.208
With no photos and just
a sketch of Frances

06:18.242 --> 06:19.510
that Bill did from memory...

06:19.543 --> 06:22.813
So this is the woman we're looking for?

06:25.582 --> 06:27.451
Yes.

06:27.484 --> 06:29.253
It quickly became clear

06:29.286 --> 06:31.221
this was going to be an uphill battle.

06:31.255 --> 06:34.525
But Bill did recall one thing
that could be helpful.

06:34.558 --> 06:37.861
Last time I saw her was in
Little Rock in Arkansas.

06:37.895 --> 06:40.731
I was working at Moses Melody Shop,

06:40.764 --> 06:42.599
the music record store.

06:42.633 --> 06:45.669
I felt that if I could get
Bill back to the city

06:45.702 --> 06:48.539
where they first dated, it
might jog some of his memories.

06:48.572 --> 06:51.542
So I booked us a flight
to Little Rock, Arkansas,

06:51.575 --> 06:54.244
to begin our search for Frances.

06:59.149 --> 07:00.717
It had been some time
since Bill had been back

07:00.751 --> 07:02.553
in his home state,

07:02.586 --> 07:04.488
and he seemed enthusiastic to return.

07:04.521 --> 07:06.423
- Are you excited, Bill?
- Yeah.

07:06.456 --> 07:10.494
It's hometown, man. I grew up here.

07:10.527 --> 07:12.496
And as I had hoped, it wasn't long

07:12.529 --> 07:15.265
before old memories began to come back.

07:15.299 --> 07:17.568
God, mother used to
pick me up right there,

07:17.601 --> 07:19.736
that station.

07:19.770 --> 07:21.371
There was a plant right there.

07:21.405 --> 07:24.608
Dr. Pepper Company right there, man.

07:24.641 --> 07:27.211
Now, that's the old
West Side Junior High.

07:27.244 --> 07:29.146
My uncle taught there.

07:29.179 --> 07:31.148
With Bill's past fresh in his mind,

07:31.181 --> 07:33.717
we headed downtown to Moses Melody Shop,

07:33.750 --> 07:35.853
the last place Bill had seen Frances

07:35.886 --> 07:37.521
over 50 years ago.

07:37.554 --> 07:40.157
It used to be right there,
the second building.

07:40.190 --> 07:41.725
I don't think it's there anymore.

07:41.758 --> 07:42.893
Everything has changed.

07:42.926 --> 07:44.928
Things had changed.

07:44.962 --> 07:47.431
Moses Melodies was now a wig store,

07:47.464 --> 07:49.299
but once inside,

07:49.333 --> 07:51.335
memories of that final
encounter with Frances

07:51.368 --> 07:53.203
began to resurface.

07:53.237 --> 07:55.405
Well, there was a counter, like, here.

07:55.439 --> 07:59.243
I was right here,
and she came in that way.

07:59.276 --> 08:02.579
I was behind the counter here.

08:02.613 --> 08:04.281
Okay.

08:04.314 --> 08:06.283
She brought her tape recorder.

08:06.316 --> 08:08.552
That's the last time I saw her.

08:08.585 --> 08:11.321
As he continued, I began to understand

08:11.355 --> 08:12.656
what a loss this was for him.

08:12.689 --> 08:15.592
She cried, said,
"I'll love you to my grave."

08:15.626 --> 08:17.227
I never will forget that.

08:17.261 --> 08:18.629
That's what she said to you?

08:18.662 --> 08:21.598
Mm-hmm, that's what she told me.

08:21.632 --> 08:23.700
So why'd you never see her again?

08:23.734 --> 08:26.637
She said, "You want your
career." I headed to Hollywood.

08:26.670 --> 08:29.640
She said, "You want your career."

08:32.342 --> 08:34.510
Those are the breaks.

08:34.544 --> 08:36.580
I was starting to realize

08:36.613 --> 08:39.448
why I was so drawn to Bill's story.

08:39.482 --> 08:41.952
As someone who also left a lot behind

08:41.985 --> 08:44.488
to pursue a career in Hollywood,

08:44.521 --> 08:46.890
I couldn't help but feel
an odd kinship with him.

08:46.924 --> 08:48.692
But the fact remained that

08:48.725 --> 08:51.328
we still had nothing concrete
to go off of

08:51.361 --> 08:54.364
besides a first name and Bill's sketch.

08:54.411 --> 08:56.626
_

08:56.633 --> 08:57.935
- Yeah.
- White?

08:57.968 --> 08:59.970
- White.
- She's white.

09:00.003 --> 09:02.506
It was as if we were trying to
find a missing person.

09:02.566 --> 09:04.644
_

09:04.715 --> 09:06.049
This is a woman.

09:06.128 --> 09:07.746
_

09:07.778 --> 09:09.479
And it was hard to know
what would lead us to her

09:09.513 --> 09:12.349
or where to even begin.

09:12.382 --> 09:13.884
On the way back to our hotel,

09:13.917 --> 09:16.019
Bill wanted to take me by
his old high school.

09:16.053 --> 09:20.023
Central High, the integration,
nine black students.

09:20.057 --> 09:21.692
They had to get
the federal troops in here

09:21.725 --> 09:25.629
to enter them.

09:25.662 --> 09:27.664
We always got along with the blacks,

09:27.698 --> 09:30.267
no problem.

09:30.300 --> 09:32.436
It's too bad that
it had to come to this,

09:32.469 --> 09:34.571
but it happened.

09:34.605 --> 09:35.873
It was neat to learn
a bit of the history

09:35.906 --> 09:37.841
of Bill's high school,

09:37.875 --> 09:40.410
but then something came up
that could be useful.

09:40.444 --> 09:43.046
Did Frances go to your high school?

09:43.080 --> 09:47.317
Um...

09:47.351 --> 09:50.687
No, she went to
Dumas High School, I believe.

09:50.721 --> 09:53.991
Dumas, Arkansas.

09:54.024 --> 09:55.726
Dumas.

09:55.759 --> 09:57.828
It turned out that Dumas was a town

09:57.861 --> 09:59.963
just under two hours from Little Rock,

09:59.997 --> 10:02.032
and if I could get in touch
with their high school,

10:02.065 --> 10:04.334
they'd most likely have student records

10:04.368 --> 10:06.937
or even an old yearbook that
could give us a clue.

10:06.970 --> 10:08.705
But the school was closed for the day

10:08.739 --> 10:10.574
so we'd have to call in the morning

10:10.607 --> 10:12.342
In the meantime,
we checked into our hotel

10:12.376 --> 10:14.545
in downtown Little Rock,

10:14.578 --> 10:16.847
and after getting unpacked
and grabbing some dinner,

10:16.880 --> 10:20.384
we decided to call it a night.

10:24.388 --> 10:26.456
This is kind of a fun trip, huh?

10:26.490 --> 10:27.691
Yeah.

10:27.724 --> 10:29.359
Just the boys.

10:29.393 --> 10:31.962
Mm-hmm.

10:31.995 --> 10:33.864
Can I ask you something?

10:33.897 --> 10:35.899
Yes.

10:35.933 --> 10:39.303
What's your favorite memory of Frances?

10:46.710 --> 10:50.080
Probably when we were
on the bed there together.

10:50.113 --> 10:51.481
When you were on the bed together?

10:51.515 --> 10:52.783
Yeah.

10:52.816 --> 10:55.018
What did you do on the bed?

10:55.052 --> 10:59.768
Well, I was trying to have sex with her.

11:01.491 --> 11:04.328
Oh, cool.

11:06.864 --> 11:08.932
All right, should we go to bed?

11:08.966 --> 11:11.401
I guess so.

11:11.435 --> 11:12.836
All right, good night, Bill.

11:12.870 --> 11:14.938
Good night.

11:14.972 --> 11:16.540
You gonna get under the covers?

11:16.573 --> 11:19.977
Oh, I'm okay right now. Thank you.

11:20.010 --> 11:21.812
Okay.

11:33.912 --> 11:35.786
The next morning
while Bill was getting ready,

11:35.819 --> 11:37.554
I decided to follow up

11:37.588 --> 11:39.122
on our Dumas High School lead

11:39.156 --> 11:40.624
when I hit a bit of a snag.

11:40.657 --> 11:42.526
I'm not a parent.

11:42.559 --> 11:44.828
Well, on our campus, to be...

11:44.861 --> 11:46.530
to even be here as a visitor

11:46.563 --> 11:48.732
you're supposed to be
a parent or a guardian.

11:48.765 --> 11:51.335
The school told me they wouldn't release

11:51.368 --> 11:52.869
any of their student records

11:52.903 --> 11:54.638
and their strict visitor policy

11:54.671 --> 11:56.239
prevented us from even coming by

11:56.273 --> 11:58.241
and looking at an old yearbook.

11:58.275 --> 12:00.277
I guess a 78-year-old man

12:00.310 --> 12:01.912
trying to track down a former student

12:01.945 --> 12:05.382
that he's in love with
does raise a few red flags.

12:05.415 --> 12:07.718
But after doing a bit of
research on the city of Dumas,

12:07.751 --> 12:09.720
something occurred to me
that could possibly be

12:09.753 --> 12:11.688
our way in.

12:11.722 --> 12:13.557
Dumas' main claim to fame was that

12:13.590 --> 12:15.726
they were the shooting location
for the 2012

12:15.759 --> 12:18.662
Matthew McConaughey movie "Mud."

12:18.695 --> 12:22.366
It was clearly a point of pride
for everyone in Dumas.

12:22.399 --> 12:24.234
So if we could pretend that
we were in town

12:24.268 --> 12:25.269
to shoot a sequel to "Mud,"

12:25.302 --> 12:27.537
Never Clean,"

12:27.571 --> 12:29.506
I was confident the city
would grant us access

12:29.539 --> 12:31.942
to any location in Dumas,

12:31.975 --> 12:33.644
including their high school

12:33.677 --> 12:36.446
with its archive of yearbooks.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.715
But to pull this off,
we'd need some credibility,

12:38.749 --> 12:42.185
so I contacted an actor named
Richard Ledbetter

12:42.219 --> 12:43.854
who could be seen faintly
in the background

12:43.887 --> 12:45.722
of a scene in the original "Mud"

12:45.756 --> 12:47.391
to come in and audition for
what he believed

12:47.424 --> 12:50.460
was a starring role in "Mud 2."

12:50.494 --> 12:53.263
So firstly, we loved
your work in "Mud" one.

12:53.297 --> 12:54.765
Thank you.

12:54.798 --> 12:56.400
I'm assuming you remember Bill Goldstein

12:56.433 --> 12:57.968
from the original shoot.

12:58.001 --> 12:59.770
I don't know that we met.
I don't think...

12:59.803 --> 13:02.406
Your face is... both of your faces
are very familiar.

13:02.439 --> 13:04.408
Oh, yeah. Well, we were
around all the time,

13:04.441 --> 13:06.276
so I'm sure you...
you saw us here and there.

13:06.310 --> 13:08.245
It's a fantastic movie. Great job.

13:08.278 --> 13:09.246
Thank you.

13:09.279 --> 13:10.881
Thank you.

13:10.914 --> 13:12.816
For his audition, I'd written some lines

13:12.849 --> 13:14.718
for a scene from "Mud 2" that
Bill would read with him.

13:17.955 --> 13:19.489
What's going on here?

13:19.523 --> 13:21.491
This place is absolutely a mess.

13:21.525 --> 13:23.293
I know.

13:23.327 --> 13:25.596
We have to clean
this high school library up.

13:25.629 --> 13:28.699
It's covered in Mud again.

13:28.732 --> 13:30.968
And I thought things
were dirty last time,

13:31.001 --> 13:33.337
but this time it's filthy.

13:33.370 --> 13:36.239
It's absolutely ridiculous,

13:36.273 --> 13:39.309
all this mud.

13:40.477 --> 13:43.680
Great. That was...

13:43.714 --> 13:46.717
He got into the lines very well.

13:46.750 --> 13:50.320
The way he read it lightly
and then he went into

13:50.354 --> 13:54.358
a stronger phase of the wording.

13:54.391 --> 13:55.926
Okay. Let him know.

13:55.959 --> 13:58.262
You can tell him.

13:58.295 --> 13:59.529
You've got the part.

13:59.563 --> 14:01.465
Fantastic. Thank you.

14:01.498 --> 14:02.933
With an actor from the original movie

14:02.966 --> 14:05.802
now part of our team,
we contacted Dumas High

14:05.836 --> 14:07.704
to say we were in town
scouting locations

14:07.738 --> 14:09.806
for the "Mud" sequel.

14:09.840 --> 14:12.476
And as I expected, they gladly
opened their doors to us.

14:12.509 --> 14:14.278
He was in the scene with the motorcycle

14:14.311 --> 14:15.412
driving beside the train tracks.

14:15.445 --> 14:16.847
- Okay.
- You could see him

14:16.880 --> 14:18.615
in the background with the shiny hair.

14:18.649 --> 14:19.983
With the school staff starstruck,

14:20.017 --> 14:22.052
they gave us the VIP treatment,

14:22.085 --> 14:24.588
taking us on a tour
of their entire campus

14:24.621 --> 14:26.723
to show off what
the high school had to offer.

14:26.765 --> 14:29.788
_

14:29.906 --> 14:32.029
But what they didn't know
was that our real purpose

14:32.062 --> 14:33.997
was to find their old yearbooks.

14:34.031 --> 14:35.332
This is a great location.

14:35.365 --> 14:37.000
Where do you keep the yearbooks?

14:37.034 --> 14:40.304
We told them "Mud 2" was
a 1950s period film

14:40.337 --> 14:43.073
and that their yearbooks would
be a helpful visual reference

14:43.106 --> 14:44.875
for re-creating the era.

14:44.908 --> 14:47.010
Hey, there's '57.

14:47.044 --> 14:49.880
Frances was at Dumas High
in the late '50s.

14:49.913 --> 14:53.083
So when we found a '57,
I knew we had what we needed.

14:53.116 --> 14:56.086
Would it be possible
for our props department

14:56.119 --> 14:56.920
to look at one of these?

14:56.954 --> 14:59.756
I don't know why not.

14:59.790 --> 15:01.792
And with that, Bill and I had pulled off

15:01.825 --> 15:03.994
a genuine heist.

15:04.027 --> 15:05.596
So once we got to a secure location,

15:05.629 --> 15:08.465
it was time to check out what we had.

15:14.871 --> 15:16.873
There she is.

15:19.109 --> 15:20.877
- That's her.
- That's her?

15:20.911 --> 15:22.746
Yes, that is her.

15:25.649 --> 15:27.751
Golly.

15:29.920 --> 15:32.055
She...

15:32.089 --> 15:34.458
That's her.

15:34.491 --> 15:36.693
It's her.

15:40.631 --> 15:42.799
That's her.

15:48.739 --> 15:50.374
That's her.

15:55.164 --> 15:57.992
The yearbook would be
an amazing resource.

15:58.025 --> 15:59.860
Not only did it have the names
of her classmates

15:59.894 --> 16:01.462
that we could try to track down,

16:01.495 --> 16:03.931
but we also now had a photo of her,

16:03.964 --> 16:05.766
and that meant there might be
a way to figure out

16:05.800 --> 16:07.802
what Frances looked like today.

16:07.835 --> 16:10.905
So I contacted a professional
age-progression specialist

16:10.938 --> 16:13.908
who I had worked with in
the past named, Cornelius Ladd,

16:13.941 --> 16:15.976
flew him out to Arkansas,

16:16.010 --> 16:17.945
and booked him a hotel room
adjacent to ours

16:17.978 --> 16:20.830
where he set up everything
he needed to get to work.

16:20.884 --> 16:23.584
This is, um...

16:24.200 --> 16:25.201
two of the same printer.

16:25.235 --> 16:27.070
Right, right.

16:27.103 --> 16:29.072
You always want to have
a backup when you travel.

16:29.105 --> 16:31.541
Oh, okay. That's great.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.643
Good to have a...

16:33.676 --> 16:35.145
- backup.
- Right.

16:35.178 --> 16:37.147
Right.

16:37.180 --> 16:38.948
But after giving him the photo,

16:38.982 --> 16:41.017
Cornelius pointed out that
this job would require

16:41.051 --> 16:42.352
a more advanced technique.

16:42.385 --> 16:44.154
The last one,

16:44.187 --> 16:47.257
we only age progressed
those children ten years.

16:47.290 --> 16:48.291
- Right.
- But now, you're talking about

16:48.324 --> 16:50.226
50 years,

16:50.260 --> 16:53.696
and the main thing about
age progression is the gravity.

16:53.730 --> 16:56.366
What makes people age is gravity.

16:56.399 --> 16:57.967
If there were no gravity...
for instance,

16:58.001 --> 16:59.302
if we all lived in outer space,

16:59.335 --> 17:01.071
as we will one day,

17:01.104 --> 17:03.440
your face would have...
would never change.

17:03.473 --> 17:05.642
You'd always look like
how you look right now.

17:05.675 --> 17:07.410
- Okay.
- There would be no gravity

17:07.444 --> 17:09.112
pulling on your face.

17:09.145 --> 17:11.247
With this picture I'm working with,

17:11.281 --> 17:14.384
or this face or this person,
I'm working with gravity.

17:14.416 --> 17:16.986
Right, okay.

17:17.020 --> 17:19.422
As a side note, though,
you might find this interesting.

17:19.455 --> 17:22.125
Scientists are predicting that
in the next 30 years

17:22.157 --> 17:23.992
we'll be able to walk into
a doctor's office,

17:24.027 --> 17:26.596
get a treatment that's
affordable to everybody,

17:26.628 --> 17:31.067
and you'll be able to live to be
600 years on average.

17:31.101 --> 17:32.736
I gave Cornelius a Jumpdrive

17:32.769 --> 17:35.538
with a scanned copy of
Frances' yearbook photo on it

17:35.572 --> 17:38.675
and then left him to his work.

17:41.578 --> 17:44.180
And a few hours later,
he called me back in

17:44.214 --> 17:45.448
with his completed rendition

17:45.482 --> 17:47.617
of what Frances would look like today.

17:47.650 --> 17:50.120
So this is her...

17:50.153 --> 17:51.554
I aged it...

17:51.588 --> 17:52.756
- 75?
- 76, yeah.

17:52.789 --> 17:54.591
75, 76 years old.

17:54.624 --> 17:56.693
And even at... even at 76,

17:56.726 --> 17:58.795
she still looks... she's
still an attractive person.

17:58.828 --> 18:01.364
Right, yeah.

18:01.398 --> 18:03.767
I think.

18:03.800 --> 18:07.036
How... how accurate
would you say this is

18:07.070 --> 18:09.506
of what Frances looks like today?

18:09.539 --> 18:12.242
I would say it's a 95% chance

18:12.275 --> 18:13.610
she looks just like that.

18:13.643 --> 18:14.811
95%?

18:14.844 --> 18:16.179
Mm-hmm.

18:16.212 --> 18:17.534
Okay.

18:17.683 --> 18:19.616
I didn't know if
I'd ever fully understand

18:19.649 --> 18:21.451
the science of age progression,

18:21.484 --> 18:23.386
but it was the best clue we had

18:23.420 --> 18:25.722
as to what a 76-year-old
Frances might look like.

18:25.755 --> 18:28.124
So I brought Bill the updated photo

18:28.158 --> 18:30.160
to see what he thought.

18:30.193 --> 18:32.195
Oh, my gosh.

18:32.228 --> 18:35.265
That's what we got.

18:37.300 --> 18:39.469
I don't know if it's 100% accurate,

18:39.502 --> 18:42.405
but there's not that many
age progressionists around

18:42.439 --> 18:45.675
so, you know, we have to take
what we can get, I guess.

18:45.709 --> 18:49.679
Who did this?

18:49.713 --> 18:52.549
Cornelius Ladd.

18:52.582 --> 18:54.851
If there was a chance Frances
still lived in the area,

18:54.884 --> 18:57.620
I felt it was worthwhile
to do a poster campaign

18:57.654 --> 19:00.390
while we chased down other leads.

19:00.423 --> 19:01.858
So we put up hundreds of fliers

19:01.891 --> 19:03.626
throughout Little Rock and Dumas

19:03.660 --> 19:05.361
in the hope someone would recognize her

19:05.395 --> 19:07.497
and give us a call.

19:07.530 --> 19:10.200
The next morning, Bill decided
to relocate from the hotel

19:10.233 --> 19:11.701
to his niece Shelly's house

19:11.735 --> 19:13.670
who lived on the outskirts
of Little Rock.

19:13.703 --> 19:16.106
She invited him to stay with her

19:16.139 --> 19:18.508
and I was curious to meet
a family member of Bill's

19:18.541 --> 19:20.610
as I thought it might help me
gain insight

19:20.643 --> 19:23.179
into his past,
and more importantly, Frances.

19:23.213 --> 19:24.781
- Hi.
- Hello!

19:24.814 --> 19:28.518
Hey there.

19:28.551 --> 19:30.253
How are you?

19:30.286 --> 19:31.388
Fine. Good to see you.

19:31.421 --> 19:33.223
Good to see you. Oh.

19:33.256 --> 19:35.859
Y'all come on in.

19:35.892 --> 19:38.194
Drake's married and moved to
northwest Arkansas.

19:38.228 --> 19:39.329
Natalie and... Who?

19:39.362 --> 19:41.331
- Drake.
- Oh, yeah.

19:41.364 --> 19:45.201
And Dakota, as you know,
and Dylan are still in school.

19:45.235 --> 19:46.803
So we're... we're good.

19:46.836 --> 19:48.671
Chris and I are finally empty nesters.

19:48.705 --> 19:50.607
Finally got freedom, huh?

19:50.640 --> 19:52.609
Yeah, that's right. That's right.

19:52.642 --> 19:54.611
So no, but we're doing good so.

19:54.644 --> 19:56.579
Well, that color in the dining room,

19:56.613 --> 19:58.882
you didn't have that
when I was here, did you?

19:58.915 --> 20:00.884
I did have that
when you were here, yeah.

20:00.917 --> 20:01.818
That's nice.

20:01.851 --> 20:03.787
Thank you.

20:03.820 --> 20:06.289
After some catching up with Shelly,

20:06.322 --> 20:08.758
Bill headed upstairs to his
grand-nephew Dakota's bedroom

20:08.792 --> 20:10.529
to unpack and get settled.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.702
Meanwhile, Shelly brought me
into the kitchen

20:12.735 --> 20:15.138
to show me some old family albums.

20:15.171 --> 20:16.372
- That's Bill?
- That's Bill.

20:16.406 --> 20:17.540
Isn't he cute? Look at that haircut.

20:17.574 --> 20:19.475
Look at that hat.

20:19.509 --> 20:22.612
So this is Easter 1939,

20:22.645 --> 20:24.547
and that's Bill.

20:24.581 --> 20:26.082
- What a cutie.
- I know.

20:26.115 --> 20:28.718
That's a picture of him in, I think...

20:28.751 --> 20:30.186
This is Bill?

20:30.220 --> 20:32.422
Uh-huh, in his younger years.

20:32.455 --> 20:33.523
- No.
- Yeah.

20:33.556 --> 20:35.058
Look at that hair.

20:35.091 --> 20:36.192
Oh, my God.

20:36.226 --> 20:38.428
Mm-hmm.

20:38.461 --> 20:41.030
I was stunned to see that Bill
was once incredibly handsome,

20:41.064 --> 20:43.533
and for the first time,
his Hollywood aspirations

20:43.566 --> 20:45.702
started to make sense.

20:45.735 --> 20:48.304
So I was hopeful Shelly would
be able to shine more light

20:48.338 --> 20:50.640
on this man who left
the love of his life

20:50.673 --> 20:52.375
for a shot at fame.

20:52.408 --> 20:55.078
Bill's dad died
when he was five years old,

20:55.111 --> 20:58.148
and his dad, I think,

20:58.181 --> 20:59.983
was in his 50s when he died,

21:00.016 --> 21:01.217
so he was fairly young.

21:01.251 --> 21:03.119
Huh.

21:03.153 --> 21:05.121
And he really struggled emotionally

21:05.155 --> 21:08.124
trying to deal with that.

21:08.158 --> 21:10.326
And I think there's just
different points of his life

21:10.360 --> 21:13.296
that he just kind of felt, you know,

21:13.329 --> 21:17.000
that maybe he's been entitled
to certain things

21:17.033 --> 21:20.270
and life doesn't always
work out that way.

21:20.303 --> 21:23.606
I think that's harder for him
to move past.

21:23.640 --> 21:27.076
Bill's memories about Frances
are very foggy...

21:27.110 --> 21:28.011
- Mm-hmm.
- And vague...

21:28.044 --> 21:29.612
Mm-hmm.

21:29.646 --> 21:32.215
And there's a lot of half information.

21:32.248 --> 21:36.286
And so I was hoping maybe you
might know stuff or...

21:36.319 --> 21:38.421
Has he mentioned her to you?

21:38.454 --> 21:41.224
Briefly, but yeah, briefly, he has.

21:41.257 --> 21:43.593
Evidently, I think he dated her

21:43.626 --> 21:45.328
and my grandmother
didn't want him to marry her.

21:45.361 --> 21:46.696
Is that what he's told you?

21:46.729 --> 21:48.631
He said something like that, yeah.

21:48.665 --> 21:51.334
I get a sense he really regrets
not marrying her.

21:51.367 --> 21:52.702
- Yes.
- He says he should have

21:52.735 --> 21:54.037
- married her.
- Yes.

21:54.070 --> 21:55.705
And Bill keeps in touch with...

21:55.738 --> 21:58.341
I mean, you know, he has his
little, literally, black book

21:58.374 --> 22:00.810
and he keeps in touch with
a lot of people:

22:00.844 --> 22:02.445
relatives, friends.

22:02.479 --> 22:05.682
He's very, very good about that.

22:05.715 --> 22:08.251
So the fact that he lost touch with her

22:08.284 --> 22:10.320
is kind of interesting to me.

22:10.353 --> 22:13.323
It was curious that Shelly,
who knew Bill so well,

22:13.356 --> 22:16.192
thought it was odd he hadn't
kept in touch with Frances.

22:16.226 --> 22:18.394
And as we kept talking,

22:18.428 --> 22:20.663
the conversation got
even more interesting.

22:20.697 --> 22:23.399
How long has Bill been doing

22:23.433 --> 22:26.169
Bill Gates impersonations?

22:26.202 --> 22:30.206
Um...

22:30.240 --> 22:31.641
I guess since he's been on the show.

22:31.674 --> 22:33.343
I mean... what?

22:33.376 --> 22:35.378
I guess since
he's done him for you guys.

22:35.411 --> 22:39.082
To our knowledge,
he's never done any before.

22:39.115 --> 22:41.251
Before "Nathan for You"?

22:41.284 --> 22:42.819
I don't think he's done
any impersonations.

22:42.852 --> 22:44.420
Did he say he has?

22:44.454 --> 22:46.422
He told me he did it professionally

22:46.456 --> 22:47.657
when I first met him.

22:47.690 --> 22:49.492
Oh, I don't know.

22:49.526 --> 22:51.628
To my knowledge, he hasn't, be he...

22:51.661 --> 22:53.363
here again, he could have done something

22:53.396 --> 22:56.399
and I wouldn't know about it.

22:56.432 --> 22:59.369
Huh.

22:59.402 --> 23:02.705
Bill was even more of an enigma
than I had expected.

23:02.739 --> 23:05.542
It was hard to tell
what was true about him,

23:05.575 --> 23:08.645
and it crossed my mind that
his relationship with Frances

23:08.678 --> 23:11.114
might not be all
that he made it out to be.

23:11.147 --> 23:13.249
If I was gonna continue
dedicating my time

23:13.283 --> 23:15.285
to helping this man,

23:15.318 --> 23:17.253
I needed to know that
he was being honest with me.

23:17.287 --> 23:19.522
What's your favorite nut?

23:19.556 --> 23:21.524
Peanuts.

23:21.558 --> 23:23.393
I love peanuts.

23:23.426 --> 23:26.663
Yeah, I like it.

23:26.696 --> 23:28.665
Can I ask you something?

23:28.698 --> 23:30.466
Go ahead.

23:30.500 --> 23:33.570
How long have you been
a Bill Gates impersonator for?

23:38.575 --> 23:41.544
Oh, four years, I think, wasn't it?

23:41.578 --> 23:44.814
Why do you ask that?

23:44.848 --> 23:47.350
When I first met you...

23:47.383 --> 23:48.885
- Yeah.
- You told me

23:48.918 --> 23:51.754
you impersonated Bill Gates
for a living.

23:51.788 --> 23:54.290
Well...

23:54.324 --> 23:56.259
did I say for a living?

23:56.292 --> 23:57.760
You do this for a living, right?

23:57.794 --> 23:59.629
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

23:59.662 --> 24:01.464
Yeah.

24:01.498 --> 24:04.234
Well, that must have been
a misunderstanding.

24:04.267 --> 24:06.436
By you or by me?

24:06.469 --> 24:09.572
Well, you know, between two people

24:09.606 --> 24:11.841
it could be a misunderstanding.

24:11.875 --> 24:14.444
So was it a misunderstanding
or did you lie to me?

24:14.477 --> 24:17.180
I never lied to you.

24:17.213 --> 24:18.615
You said you were
a professional Bill Gates.

24:18.648 --> 24:21.451
I don't know where you got that.

24:21.484 --> 24:22.752
It's in the show.

24:25.421 --> 24:26.890
You told me on camera.

24:31.895 --> 24:35.398
Are you exaggerating anything
about this relationship

24:35.431 --> 24:36.666
with Frances that I should know about?

24:36.699 --> 24:39.802
No. No exaggeration.

24:39.836 --> 24:42.372
Everything I've told you is the truth.

24:42.405 --> 24:43.540
You've told me everything?

24:43.573 --> 24:45.842
Well, everything that I can remember,

24:45.875 --> 24:48.545
but if I think of anything else,
I'll let you know.

24:50.446 --> 24:52.215
You weren't like a stalker
or anything, right?

24:52.248 --> 24:53.917
No.

24:53.950 --> 24:55.819
Okay.

24:55.852 --> 24:58.988
No.

24:59.022 --> 25:01.891
You think I was... look like a stalker?

25:04.794 --> 25:07.730
It wasn't the most
reassuring conversation.

25:07.764 --> 25:08.998
Bill had an odd way of communicating

25:09.032 --> 25:11.301
that was hard to decipher.

25:11.334 --> 25:13.903
Here I go digging in again.

25:17.740 --> 25:19.843
And as I left that day,

25:19.876 --> 25:21.744
I found it hard to know
what to really believe

25:21.778 --> 25:23.980
about this relationship
from so long ago.

25:28.597 --> 25:33.707
- Her... her name is Frances?
- Yes It's my great grandmother.

25:33.740 --> 25:36.576
Do you know her name before
she got married by any chance?

25:36.876 --> 25:39.970
_

25:40.180 --> 25:42.716
Okay.

25:42.749 --> 25:44.851
The next day I got a call from someone

25:44.885 --> 25:46.720
who had seen one of our Frances posters

25:46.753 --> 25:48.788
and thought it might be
his great-grandmother.

25:48.822 --> 25:51.725
Do you know what year she was born?

25:51.967 --> 25:55.522
_

25:55.762 --> 25:57.996
- She's old, right?
- Oh Yah.

25:58.364 --> 26:01.034
He didn't know many details
about her past,

26:01.067 --> 26:02.602
but before putting us in touch with her,

26:02.635 --> 26:04.707
he asked to meet us
during his lunch break.

26:04.895 --> 26:12.839
_

26:13.079 --> 26:15.648
Okay, thanks so much. All right.

26:15.682 --> 26:17.317
So I hurried over to Shelly's house

26:17.350 --> 26:19.185
to update Bill on the news.

26:19.219 --> 26:22.255
So a guy named Jake called

26:22.288 --> 26:24.591
because he saw the Frances posters.

26:24.624 --> 26:27.494
His great-grandma's name is Frances.

26:27.527 --> 26:29.162
She has a different last name,

26:29.195 --> 26:31.764
but he doesn't know what her name was.

26:31.798 --> 26:33.800
He thinks that's her?

26:33.833 --> 26:35.502
He doesn't know.

26:50.583 --> 26:52.085
- Jake?
- Yes, sir.

26:52.118 --> 26:53.353
- Hey.
- Hey, how are you?

26:53.386 --> 26:54.821
Hi, how are you?

26:54.854 --> 26:56.422
Nathan. Nice to meet you.

26:56.456 --> 26:58.358
- Bill.
- Nice to meet you.

26:58.391 --> 27:00.360
You don't remember her maiden name?

27:00.393 --> 27:04.197
No. I'm... I'm her great-grandson so,

27:04.230 --> 27:05.665
and she's been married...

27:05.698 --> 27:06.800
well, she was actually
married a couple of times.

27:06.833 --> 27:08.134
Who, she was?

27:08.168 --> 27:09.669
Yes.

27:09.702 --> 27:12.672
Remember, I told you that
she was married twice.

27:12.705 --> 27:14.841
Right. How... she was married twice?

27:14.874 --> 27:16.109
- More than once for sure.
- Okay.

27:16.142 --> 27:18.711
She's out in Roland.

27:18.745 --> 27:20.814
Well, could I meet her now?

27:20.847 --> 27:24.083
Possibly, yeah.

27:24.117 --> 27:26.653
After showing Jake that we
were good for the reward money,

27:26.686 --> 27:28.555
he was willing to help us out.

27:28.588 --> 27:30.590
So he gave us his
great-grandma's address

27:30.623 --> 27:32.425
and we headed across town

27:32.459 --> 27:34.327
to see if this was the Frances

27:34.360 --> 27:35.862
that Bill had been searching for.

27:35.895 --> 27:37.864
I think we're close.

27:41.401 --> 27:42.502
You ready?

27:42.535 --> 27:43.837
Yeah.

27:43.870 --> 27:45.138
Okay.

28:38.892 --> 28:40.794
- Hello.
- How are you?

28:40.827 --> 28:41.928
I'm fine.

28:41.961 --> 28:44.464
You're Frances?

28:44.497 --> 28:46.733
I'm Frances. I'm Frances Watson.

28:46.766 --> 28:49.402
What was your maiden name? Was it Gaddy?

28:49.436 --> 28:52.906
No, my maiden name was Aplin.

28:52.939 --> 28:55.275
Oh, okay.

28:55.308 --> 28:58.611
I was looking for a Francis Gaddy.

28:58.645 --> 29:00.780
No.

29:00.814 --> 29:03.349
Come... come in, I'm sorry.

29:03.383 --> 29:06.820
I'm not... I'm not meaning to
make you stand out here

29:06.853 --> 29:08.621
on the street corner.

29:08.655 --> 29:10.557
Hi, I'm Nathan.

29:10.590 --> 29:12.459
Hi, Nathan.

29:12.492 --> 29:13.593
- Hi.
- I'm Frances.

29:13.626 --> 29:14.661
Hi, nice to meet you.

29:14.694 --> 29:15.795
Is this... is this the...

29:15.829 --> 29:17.330
No.

29:17.363 --> 29:19.933
So this woman doesn't ring a bell?

29:19.966 --> 29:21.234
Okay.

29:21.267 --> 29:23.570
Could I use your restroom?

29:23.603 --> 29:26.239
Just a moment and let me see
if there's anybody in it

29:26.272 --> 29:29.242
because there's more than
one person in this house so.

29:30.610 --> 29:32.245
Okay.

29:32.278 --> 29:33.847
You can't wait?

29:33.880 --> 29:35.648
Well, when the bladder's full,

29:35.682 --> 29:36.983
you feel better when you empty it

29:37.016 --> 29:39.719
even though you could wait.

29:39.752 --> 29:41.821
I'll... I'll wait outside, Bill.

29:41.855 --> 29:43.923
God bless you.

29:43.957 --> 29:45.725
Thank you. I appreciate all your help.

29:53.333 --> 29:56.002
Hey, you all good?

29:56.035 --> 29:57.837
Yeah.

29:57.871 --> 29:59.472
Okay.

29:59.506 --> 30:02.008
It wasn't her, though.

30:05.712 --> 30:07.847
How was her bathroom?

30:07.881 --> 30:11.751
Mm, it was all right, you know,

30:11.785 --> 30:14.721
but it could have been cleaner.

30:20.919 --> 30:21.753
After doing some research
in the phone book,

30:21.787 --> 30:24.022
I discovered that there was no one

30:24.056 --> 30:25.624
with the first name Frances
that still lived in Dumas.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.926
I was hopeful that
one of her old classmates

30:27.959 --> 30:30.028
might still have a connection to her

30:30.062 --> 30:32.564
but I was struggling to find
any that were still alive

30:32.597 --> 30:35.200
who would respond to my emails.

30:35.233 --> 30:37.135
While we were in town,

30:37.169 --> 30:39.304
Bill attended his 60-year
high school reunion

30:39.338 --> 30:40.939
at Little Rock Central High.

30:40.972 --> 30:43.141
Oh, hello!

30:43.175 --> 30:46.511
Dozens of his old classmates
who still lived in the area

30:46.545 --> 30:48.380
came out to catch up, share stories,

30:48.413 --> 30:50.482
and take photos.

30:50.515 --> 30:52.918
Seeing all of Bill's
old friends reconnect

30:52.951 --> 30:54.920
gave me an idea

30:54.953 --> 30:56.621
that maybe something like this
would be a way

30:56.655 --> 30:59.658
to get Frances' classmates
to come to us.

30:59.691 --> 31:02.627
In the yearbook we had,
Frances was a sophomore.

31:02.661 --> 31:05.664
So I designed an invite for
a Dumas High School

31:05.697 --> 31:09.067
class of 1959 57-year reunion,

31:09.101 --> 31:11.636
printed out thousands of copies,

31:11.670 --> 31:14.106
and then met up with a group
of local boys with bikes

31:14.139 --> 31:17.109
to distribute them in the hopes
that anyone from the yearbook

31:17.142 --> 31:19.478
who was still in town
would come to the event.

31:19.511 --> 31:21.079
All right, so which one
of you guys is the leader?

31:21.113 --> 31:22.681
He's the boss.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.483
- You're the leader?
- Yeah.

31:24.516 --> 31:26.318
- I'm gonna talk to you then.
- All right.

31:26.351 --> 31:27.419
I'm gonna need these fliers distributed

31:27.452 --> 31:29.287
to every home in Dumas, okay?

31:29.321 --> 31:31.089
- All right.
- Now, I don't want you guys,

31:31.123 --> 31:33.625
you know, throwing them in
the trash and saying you did it.

31:33.659 --> 31:35.027
I really need them
to go to every home, okay?

31:35.060 --> 31:36.228
All right. You got it.

31:36.261 --> 31:38.196
- Got it?
- Got it.

31:38.230 --> 31:41.433
Okay. You guys seem like
good boys, so I can trust you.

31:41.466 --> 31:42.467
All right. Sounds good.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.236
- Great.
- Yes, sir.

31:44.269 --> 31:46.104
So with the invites being delivered,

31:46.138 --> 31:49.341
I rented a church social hall
and began preparations.

31:49.374 --> 31:51.109
We decided it would be best
if Bill attended

31:51.143 --> 31:53.445
posing as a fellow student

31:53.478 --> 31:55.647
so he could blend in
and ask about Frances

31:55.681 --> 31:57.349
without arousing suspicion.

31:57.382 --> 31:58.950
Are you cool to go undercover again?

31:58.984 --> 32:00.485
Yeah.

32:00.519 --> 32:02.321
So I picked someone in the yearbook

32:02.354 --> 32:03.722
who Bill somewhere resembled...

32:03.755 --> 32:05.624
You kinda look like him.

32:05.657 --> 32:07.526
And then we spent the afternoon
practicing his portrayal

32:07.559 --> 32:09.494
using the information we had.

32:09.528 --> 32:12.464
Hi, I'm Alex Sanford.

32:12.497 --> 32:15.734
You might remember me
from the chess club,

32:15.767 --> 32:17.636
the glee club.

32:17.669 --> 32:20.739
And we all were in high school together,

32:20.772 --> 32:24.343
and I just want to say

32:24.376 --> 32:28.246
happy Dumas class reunion.

32:30.182 --> 32:31.750
Bill was pretty convincing as Alex,

32:31.783 --> 32:34.052
but I also needed him to memorize facts

32:34.086 --> 32:35.554
about other members of the class

32:35.587 --> 32:36.688
that he might encounter.

32:36.722 --> 32:38.657
Tommy Peacock.

32:38.690 --> 32:41.059
Uh...

32:41.093 --> 32:43.295
glee club, track.

32:43.328 --> 32:45.297
No, basketball, band, and track.

32:45.330 --> 32:47.366
Basketball, band, and track.

32:47.399 --> 32:48.433
Got it?

32:48.467 --> 32:49.735
Mm-hmm.

32:49.768 --> 32:51.636
He was still a little shaky,

32:51.670 --> 32:53.438
but it would have to do,
because before long,

32:53.472 --> 32:55.607
the night of the reunion was upon us.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.243
We had successfully transformed
the church social hall

32:58.276 --> 33:02.047
I had rented into a ballroom
fit for Cinderella herself,

33:02.080 --> 33:04.683
and Bill looked like the
spitting image of Alex Sanford

33:04.716 --> 33:07.085
in the thick-rimmed,
nonprescription glasses

33:07.119 --> 33:08.687
we had purchased from Sam's Club.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.189
So while we waited for guests to arrive,

33:11.223 --> 33:13.792
Bill hid outside while
I changed into the outfit

33:13.825 --> 33:16.728
of the school mascot, the Dumas Bobcat,

33:16.762 --> 33:18.430
so I could covertly come to Bill's aid

33:18.463 --> 33:20.332
if he ever needed help.

33:25.470 --> 33:28.073
We only got a few RSVPs,

33:28.106 --> 33:29.775
but I was hopeful one of these people

33:29.808 --> 33:32.544
would have kept in touch
with Frances over the years

33:32.577 --> 33:34.479
and perhaps even know her whereabouts.

33:34.515 --> 33:38.711
_

33:40.252 --> 33:41.820
So once the room had filled
and the guests were mingling,

33:41.853 --> 33:44.623
it was time for Bill
to make his entrance.

33:50.395 --> 33:53.231
Alex Sanford, Doris, it's been a while.

33:53.275 --> 33:55.721
_

33:55.801 --> 33:57.931
I'm a neurosurgeon.

33:58.033 --> 33:59.893
_

34:00.505 --> 34:02.441
Before asking anyone about Frances,

34:02.474 --> 34:04.309
I had Bill make some small talk

34:04.343 --> 34:06.144
to make sure he was blending in.

34:06.178 --> 34:08.647
Well, I can't believe I'm
sitting here with Tommy Peacock,

34:08.679 --> 34:10.482
basketball, band, and track.

34:12.284 --> 34:13.851
I was a better tenor sax player

34:13.885 --> 34:16.722
than I was at basketball
or track runner.

34:16.755 --> 34:18.290
Are you still running track?

34:18.322 --> 34:20.391
- No, sir.
- No.

34:20.425 --> 34:22.594
But I knew that Bill would
still have to do more

34:22.627 --> 34:24.496
to be fully embraced by the group.

34:24.540 --> 34:26.554
_

34:26.764 --> 34:29.134
Grade school, wasn't it?

34:30.869 --> 34:32.871
From my research, I learned that Dumas

34:32.904 --> 34:34.840
had an unofficial town anthem

34:34.873 --> 34:37.641
called "I'm a Ding Dong Daddy
from Dumas."

34:37.676 --> 34:39.844
So before the event,
I rehearsed it with Bill

34:39.878 --> 34:41.679
knowing it would be a surefire way

34:41.713 --> 34:43.748
of proving he was a local.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.851
And with the song lyrics hidden
on teleprompter

34:45.884 --> 34:47.652
behind the Arkansas flag,

34:47.686 --> 34:49.554
I signaled Bill to hit the stage

34:49.588 --> 34:51.790
to cement his insider status.

35:04.736 --> 35:08.340
♪ Yeah, I'm a ding dong daddy
from Dumas ♪

35:08.373 --> 35:11.376
♪ And you ought to see me do my stuff ♪

35:11.410 --> 35:15.347
♪ I'm a fella from Horner's Corner ♪

35:15.380 --> 35:18.650
♪ Can you ♪ [STAMMERS]

35:18.684 --> 35:22.354
♪ I'm a paper cuttin' cutie

35:22.387 --> 35:25.724
♪ She's a little heavy lady

35:25.757 --> 35:28.760
♪ I'm a ding dong daddy from Dumas ♪

35:28.794 --> 35:32.230

35:32.264 --> 35:35.734
♪ Yes a ding dong daddy from Dumas ♪

35:35.767 --> 35:39.538
♪ And you ought to see me do my stuff ♪

35:39.571 --> 35:41.273
The performance was a hit,

35:41.306 --> 35:43.875
and it seemed like even
the most skeptical in the group

35:43.909 --> 35:46.745
couldn't deny they were
looking at a local.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.928
So with Bill in their good graces,

36:02.961 --> 36:05.364
it was time for him to start
asking about Frances.

36:06.592 --> 36:08.627
- Thank you.
- Whoo!

36:08.634 --> 36:10.517
_

36:10.635 --> 36:13.438
Alex Sanford. Nice to see you again.

36:13.472 --> 36:16.308
Have you ever heard anything
from Frances Gaddy?

36:16.353 --> 36:17.462
_

36:17.609 --> 36:18.829
No.

36:18.876 --> 36:22.087
_

36:23.448 --> 36:26.585
Whatever happened to Frances Gaddy?

36:26.604 --> 36:30.776
_

36:31.623 --> 36:34.493
You ever hear from her?

36:34.526 --> 36:37.396
But no one Bill talked to had
seen or heard from her

36:37.429 --> 36:39.297
since high school.

36:39.331 --> 36:41.667
Some thought she had moved
out of state years ago

36:41.700 --> 36:43.196
but no one was sure.

36:43.251 --> 36:46.587
_

36:46.772 --> 36:48.768
Where is she now?

36:48.902 --> 36:52.058
_

36:52.310 --> 36:53.792
You haven't heard anything, period.

36:53.800 --> 36:56.456
_

36:56.581 --> 36:58.517
If Frances had left the state,

36:58.550 --> 37:01.620
this search would become
exponentially more difficult,

37:01.653 --> 37:03.288
and by the end of the night,

37:03.322 --> 37:04.823
I was having serious doubts

37:04.856 --> 37:07.492
that we would ever find this woman.

37:11.180 --> 37:14.265
_

37:14.679 --> 37:17.750
_

37:17.804 --> 37:21.625
_

37:21.789 --> 37:24.609
_

37:24.617 --> 37:26.398
_

37:26.411 --> 37:27.713
These are from 1960?

37:27.746 --> 37:29.047
Yes.

37:29.081 --> 37:29.915
All of these are from Frances?

37:29.948 --> 37:31.983
Frances.

37:32.017 --> 37:34.052
While going through some storage

37:34.086 --> 37:35.921
at his older sister Betsy's
house over the weekend,

37:35.954 --> 37:38.357
Bill has discovered dozens of letters

37:38.390 --> 37:41.827
that Frances has written him
between 1960 and '61.

37:47.081 --> 37:49.735
"Dear Bill, just a note to say
I'm thinking about you

37:49.768 --> 37:51.803
"as usual tonight.

37:51.837 --> 37:54.473
"I'm all alone tonight
and I wish you were here,

37:54.506 --> 37:56.942
"but your picture is
sitting on my other pillow.

37:56.975 --> 37:59.378
"Each time that I look up
and see your picture,

37:59.411 --> 38:01.680
"it reminds me of how much
that I love you.

38:01.713 --> 38:05.017
"It seems like a thousand years
since I've talked to you.

38:05.050 --> 38:08.020
"I wish that it was possible
for us to see each other

38:08.053 --> 38:09.721
"but it isn't.

38:09.755 --> 38:13.058
"I think about you a lot.

38:13.091 --> 38:14.693
"Some day we will be able
to have each other

38:14.726 --> 38:16.428
"and we will appreciate the value

38:16.461 --> 38:18.397
"of a pure and true love

38:18.430 --> 38:21.867
"that we both have worked
and waited so long for.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.902
"My love is pure and clean
for you, darling,

38:23.935 --> 38:25.871
and only for you."

38:25.904 --> 38:28.106
That's a strong statement.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.677
She was in love with you, Bill.

38:34.446 --> 38:36.982
It was the first real evidence
of their relationship

38:37.015 --> 38:39.851
I had seen, but as I kept reading,

38:39.885 --> 38:41.953
I realized there was
a lot more going on here

38:41.987 --> 38:43.388
than Bill had led me to believe.

38:43.422 --> 38:45.090
"Dearest Bill,

38:45.123 --> 38:47.726
"I'm sorry I haven't written to
you sooner this week.

38:47.759 --> 38:49.795
"I'm warning you,

38:49.828 --> 38:52.130
"I won't listen to this much longer.

38:52.164 --> 38:54.599
"I am disgusted with you

38:54.633 --> 38:57.069
"of all this talk and gossip

38:57.102 --> 38:59.037
"about you and Gloria.

38:59.071 --> 39:00.772
You and who?

39:00.806 --> 39:04.576
Gloria?

39:04.609 --> 39:05.711
Was her name mentioned there?

39:05.744 --> 39:06.812
Yeah.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.413
Oh, yeah.

39:08.447 --> 39:09.548
Who's Gloria?

39:09.581 --> 39:12.617
That was a woman.

39:15.954 --> 39:18.924
Were you cheating on her?

39:21.193 --> 39:24.029
I think we went out a few times.

39:26.999 --> 39:30.135
These letters chronicled
the breakdown of a relationship

39:30.168 --> 39:33.071
that was far more complex
than the storybook version

39:33.105 --> 39:35.073
Bill had given me.

39:35.107 --> 39:36.775
And it did make me wonder

39:36.808 --> 39:38.577
if there was anything else
he was hiding.

39:38.610 --> 39:39.911
"I know I'm not beautiful

39:39.945 --> 39:42.114
and I'm not an actress."

39:42.147 --> 39:45.684
Oh, she was beautiful, come on.

39:45.717 --> 39:48.787
"There are many things
I do not know about you.

39:48.820 --> 39:51.023
Bill, I can't believe that
you're playing with my love."

39:53.225 --> 39:55.627
Yeah.

39:55.661 --> 39:57.195
Well...

39:57.229 --> 39:59.998
Why does she say she doesn't know you?

40:00.032 --> 40:02.100
"There are many things
I do not know about you."

40:02.134 --> 40:03.602
What does that mean?

40:03.635 --> 40:05.971
I don't know.

40:06.004 --> 40:09.174
I...

40:09.207 --> 40:12.044
Maybe she couldn't figure out me.

40:13.779 --> 40:16.214
Can you figure out you?

40:18.150 --> 40:20.552
Myself?

40:20.585 --> 40:22.821
Sometimes I wonder.

40:29.427 --> 40:34.231
And you find yourself
in a different place...

40:36.500 --> 40:39.470
a place where you were
when you were 20 years old...

40:43.140 --> 40:46.277
when you were attending
the First Baptist Church

40:46.310 --> 40:49.146
in Little Rock, Arkansas.

40:53.517 --> 40:56.354
And take a look down at your feet...

40:58.089 --> 41:01.092
and notice what you're wearing.

41:01.125 --> 41:02.326
I had booked Bill some sessions

41:02.360 --> 41:04.128
with a local hypnotherapist

41:04.161 --> 41:05.997
in the hopes it could dig up
some memories

41:06.030 --> 41:07.665
that would help me understand this man.

41:07.698 --> 41:10.167
But after several sessions,

41:10.201 --> 41:12.269
all he seemed to recall
were old statistics

41:12.303 --> 41:14.071
about the Arkansas Razorbacks.

41:14.105 --> 41:17.208
It was a bad call.
We should have won the game.

41:17.241 --> 41:19.677
Should have won the game,

41:19.710 --> 41:22.213
and...

41:22.246 --> 41:25.583
it was 15-14 was the final score.

41:25.616 --> 41:28.019
Wow.

41:28.052 --> 41:29.620
Meanwhile, I'd been going
through the letters

41:29.653 --> 41:32.123
Frances had sent Bill
nearly 60 years ago

41:32.156 --> 41:34.025
trying to piece together the details

41:34.058 --> 41:35.993
of what I was beginning to understand

41:36.027 --> 41:38.629
had been a very complex relationship.

41:38.663 --> 41:41.332
Frances was head over heels for Bill,

41:41.365 --> 41:43.534
and I was struck by how much
she believed in him,

41:43.567 --> 41:45.970
his career, and their future together.

41:46.003 --> 41:48.139
Each day makes me love you more

41:48.172 --> 41:50.307
It's hard to explain.

41:50.341 --> 41:52.376
In a way it is unexplainable.

41:52.410 --> 41:56.180
We can work together for the
kind of future that we want.

41:56.213 --> 41:58.582
I realize that it will be
a long, hard struggle

41:58.616 --> 42:00.451
to reach your goal
as an actor and singer,

42:00.484 --> 42:03.487
but someday you will reach it
with God's help.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.690
You will make it.

42:05.723 --> 42:07.591
But as hopeful as she was,

42:07.625 --> 42:10.094
there were some passages
that gave me pause.

42:10.127 --> 42:11.529
One that I'll have
for the man that I marry

42:11.562 --> 42:13.998
will be purity.

42:14.031 --> 42:17.368
If you don't want a girl
like that, I'm sorry.

42:17.401 --> 42:19.370
I knew that you wanted to know
just how far that I would go.

42:19.403 --> 42:21.672
Well, you know now.

42:21.706 --> 42:24.075
Let us drop that subject now.

42:24.108 --> 42:26.210
In these letters,
Bill almost seemed like

42:26.243 --> 42:28.412
a different person than the man I knew.

42:28.446 --> 42:30.081
I don't believe you can love anyone

42:30.114 --> 42:32.216
if you don't respect them.

42:32.249 --> 42:34.118
And I couldn't help but wonder

42:34.151 --> 42:36.487
if he acted differently around women.

42:36.520 --> 42:39.290
If there was a potential of
reuniting these two,

42:39.323 --> 42:42.293
I wanted to make sure that Bill
would act appropriately.

42:42.326 --> 42:46.597
There's this guy, Bill, that was...

42:46.630 --> 42:49.266
he's, like, searching for
this long-lost love.

42:49.300 --> 42:50.534
Okay.

42:50.568 --> 42:52.436
So I found someone online

42:52.470 --> 42:54.372
who was willing to
go on a date with Bill

42:54.405 --> 42:56.774
so I could observe his behavior
in a romantic setting.

42:56.807 --> 42:59.710
Just so you know, he's... he's very old.

42:59.744 --> 43:02.246
Like, extremely old.

43:04.115 --> 43:07.084
I have a lot of clients that are widowed

43:07.118 --> 43:10.154
or a lot that are widowed,

43:10.187 --> 43:13.691
divorced, newly divorced.

43:13.724 --> 43:16.160
Her name was Maci,

43:16.193 --> 43:18.295
and even though I didn't know
much about the escort business,

43:18.329 --> 43:20.598
she was cool with my request to
have the date with Bill

43:20.631 --> 43:22.400
be only talking with no touching.

43:22.433 --> 43:24.301
Yeah, mm-hmm.

43:24.335 --> 43:26.103
So I made a booking through her website

43:26.137 --> 43:28.139
at her flirtation rate of $350 an hour

43:28.172 --> 43:30.408
and then met up with Bill

43:30.441 --> 43:32.443
to see if I could get him to
agree to a date with Maci.

43:32.476 --> 43:34.311
I thought it might be nice for
you to have

43:34.345 --> 43:35.813
some companionship, you know,

43:35.846 --> 43:37.748
someone to hang out with.

43:37.782 --> 43:40.584
So I decided to book you a session

43:40.618 --> 43:42.753
with an escort.

43:42.787 --> 43:45.656
Really?

43:48.626 --> 43:50.828
Escort service?

43:50.861 --> 43:52.763
Yeah, she's a professional escort.

43:52.797 --> 43:54.832
No, I'm sorry.

43:54.865 --> 43:56.634
You don't want that?

43:56.667 --> 43:58.169
I hate to use that term,

43:58.202 --> 44:01.439
you gotta know
what you're sticking it in.

44:01.472 --> 44:03.507
Jesus, Bill.

44:03.541 --> 44:05.643
That's right.

44:05.676 --> 44:08.279
Even after I told Bill it
wasn't supposed to be sexual,

44:08.312 --> 44:10.815
he declined, saying it went
against his values.

44:10.848 --> 44:13.284
Sodom and Gomorrah sin.

44:13.317 --> 44:15.286
- A sin?
- Yes.

44:15.319 --> 44:17.188
It was too bad Bill didn't want to do it

44:17.221 --> 44:19.323
but since we had already paid her,

44:19.357 --> 44:21.392
I felt it might be worth
interviewing Maci

44:21.425 --> 44:23.594
to see if she had any insights
into the mind-set

44:23.627 --> 44:25.696
of old, single men.

44:25.730 --> 44:27.665
So later that day,
she agreed to meet up with me

44:27.698 --> 44:29.700
for an on-camera chat.

44:29.734 --> 44:30.801
I've never done this, so...

44:30.835 --> 44:32.269
You've never been on camera.

44:32.303 --> 44:33.804
- Like... no.
- Oh, really?

44:33.838 --> 44:35.172
Never.

44:35.206 --> 44:36.340
Is it weird for you?

44:36.374 --> 44:37.541
It is a little weird, yeah.

44:37.575 --> 44:39.276
Okay. Are you okay with it?

44:39.310 --> 44:40.611
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Okay.

44:40.644 --> 44:42.646
It's just different.

44:42.680 --> 44:44.315
It took a little time
for Maci to get comfortable

44:44.348 --> 44:46.283
with the cameras,
but she soon volunteered

44:46.317 --> 44:47.618
to tell me about what she does.

44:47.651 --> 44:49.353
A lot of IT people,

44:49.387 --> 44:52.690
a lot of, like,
corporate America finance.

44:52.723 --> 44:54.191
That's who you see the most.

44:54.225 --> 44:56.193
Attorneys, doctors.

44:56.227 --> 44:58.562
Oh, wow. What about judges?

44:58.596 --> 45:01.165
I've met a judge, I have.

45:01.198 --> 45:02.667
- Really?
- I've met a preacher.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.902
I've met...

45:04.935 --> 45:07.238
I've actually met two preachers.

45:07.271 --> 45:08.439
Met, meaning, like, they...

45:08.472 --> 45:10.508
Yeah.

45:10.541 --> 45:12.209
I was surprised to learn that
the escort business

45:12.243 --> 45:13.511
was a lot more normal and accepted

45:13.544 --> 45:14.845
than I initially thought.

45:14.879 --> 45:16.714
Like, I meet some really great people

45:16.747 --> 45:18.649
and they'll want to keep in touch.

45:18.683 --> 45:20.685
Like, they'll send emails and be
like, "Hey, how are you doing?"

45:20.718 --> 45:21.585
- Really?
- "Hope everything's okay."

45:21.619 --> 45:23.354
Yeah.

45:23.387 --> 45:25.523
If I feel like
I'm gonna connect with you,

45:25.556 --> 45:27.425
I know I'm gonna have a good time,

45:27.458 --> 45:30.394
and you're probably gonna have
a good time, too.

45:30.428 --> 45:32.897
Maci's perspective was fascinating,

45:32.930 --> 45:34.865
but she also wanted to know
more about me.

45:34.899 --> 45:37.268
I make a show called
"Nathan for You" on...

45:37.301 --> 45:39.270
- Okay.
- And it's one Comedy Central.

45:39.303 --> 45:40.471
- It's...
- Is it funny?

45:40.504 --> 45:41.806
Is it like a funny thing?

45:41.839 --> 45:43.774
I mean, I hope sometimes.

45:43.808 --> 45:44.942
I don't know.

45:44.975 --> 45:46.477
Do you think I'm funny?

45:46.510 --> 45:47.745
I don't know.

45:47.778 --> 45:49.347
You seem kind of serious right now.

45:49.380 --> 45:50.581
Do you want to see some of the show?

45:50.614 --> 45:52.350
- I have...
- Yeah.

45:52.383 --> 45:54.218
I have it in my computer in my backpack.

45:54.251 --> 45:55.419
Yeah, I'll watch it.

45:55.453 --> 45:56.754
- You want to?
- Yeah.

45:56.787 --> 45:57.955
Okay, I'll go get it.

45:57.988 --> 45:59.357
- Okay.
- All right, wait here.

45:59.390 --> 46:00.958
Okay.

46:00.991 --> 46:03.461
My name is Nathan Fielder,

46:03.494 --> 46:05.396
and I graduated from one of
Canada's top business schools

46:05.429 --> 46:07.431
with really good grades.

46:07.465 --> 46:09.767
Now, I'm using my knowledge

46:09.800 --> 46:11.435
to help struggling
small business owners...

46:11.469 --> 46:12.737
Was that actually your grades?

46:12.770 --> 46:14.772
Competitive world.

46:14.805 --> 46:16.607
Maci seemed to enjoy my show.

46:16.640 --> 46:18.242
You're a little funny.

46:18.275 --> 46:19.643
- Okay.
- Kind of mean but...

46:19.677 --> 46:20.911
- Mean?
- But you're a little funny.

46:20.945 --> 46:22.646
- Yeah.
- What do you mean?

46:22.680 --> 46:25.649
You lied to every last one of them.

46:25.683 --> 46:27.785
I mean, it's business.

46:27.818 --> 46:29.320
You're like mean funny.

46:29.353 --> 46:30.488
It's business, right?

46:30.521 --> 46:32.923
You're right, yeah.

46:32.957 --> 46:34.291
But eventually she had to get going,

46:34.325 --> 46:35.593
so we said our good-byes.

46:35.626 --> 46:37.395
- Bye, Maci.
- Bye.

46:39.864 --> 46:41.799
Without any promising leads to pursue,

46:41.832 --> 46:44.368
I found myself stuck in a strange city

46:44.402 --> 46:46.737
with a lot of free time on my hands.

46:46.771 --> 46:48.572
I spent most of my nights staying in

46:48.606 --> 46:50.808
and watching TV

46:50.841 --> 46:53.878
or going out to a nearby bar
to chat up the locals.

46:53.943 --> 46:55.630
_

46:55.713 --> 46:58.315
What does?

46:58.349 --> 47:00.785
Oh, your watchband wears out?

47:00.818 --> 47:03.621
Yeah, that... that's not good.

47:03.654 --> 47:07.391
But overall, I found the social
interactions to be lacking,

47:07.425 --> 47:10.027
and I realized the only
interesting conversation

47:10.061 --> 47:12.430
I'd had in a long time was with Maci.

47:12.463 --> 47:14.298
So I decided to call her up

47:14.332 --> 47:16.467
and see if she wanted to hang out again.

47:16.500 --> 47:17.501
Hello.

47:17.535 --> 47:19.036
Hi, Maci?

47:19.070 --> 47:20.838
Hey.

47:20.871 --> 47:23.474
I had a really good time

47:23.507 --> 47:25.710
talking to you in the park and stuff.

47:25.743 --> 47:29.680
I was wondering if you would
want to hang out again

47:29.714 --> 47:31.382
or...

47:31.415 --> 47:34.919
Well, it's $350 for the hour.

47:34.952 --> 47:38.322
You just let me know
when you want to book.

47:38.356 --> 47:39.824
Okay.

47:39.857 --> 47:40.925
- Hey.
- How's it going?

47:40.958 --> 47:42.660
Good. How are you?

47:42.693 --> 47:43.794
Good to see you.

47:43.828 --> 47:45.830
Good to see you.

47:45.863 --> 47:47.898
This is for you.

47:47.932 --> 47:49.633
We don't do that
in public, but it's okay.

47:49.667 --> 47:50.801
Oh, okay, really?

47:50.835 --> 47:52.470
Yes.

47:52.503 --> 47:53.838
Okay, when do I... I didn't know.

47:53.871 --> 47:54.839
I just wanted to make sure.

47:54.872 --> 47:56.807
It's a gift card or a gift bag.

47:56.841 --> 47:57.942
Oh, what do you mean?

47:57.975 --> 47:59.076
So it doesn't look funny in public.

47:59.110 --> 48:00.745
What am I supposed to do?

48:00.778 --> 48:01.812
Oh, you say...

48:01.846 --> 48:02.947
When you're in public...

48:02.980 --> 48:04.348
You give a gift card.

48:04.382 --> 48:06.817
Like a card, like a greeting card.

48:06.851 --> 48:08.953
Oh, okay. Okay,
okay, I know for next time.

48:08.986 --> 48:10.054
- Okay.
- Okay.

48:10.087 --> 48:13.090
Thank you. I'm so... yeah.

48:13.124 --> 48:14.625
It was a little odd to be paying someone

48:14.659 --> 48:16.594
for their company,

48:16.627 --> 48:18.596
but Maci had a way
of making it feel normal.

48:18.629 --> 48:20.498
I watched some more of your stuff.

48:20.531 --> 48:21.832
- Really?
- I did.

48:21.866 --> 48:22.967
What'd you think?

48:23.000 --> 48:25.569
Okay, so...

48:25.603 --> 48:28.072
I watched the...

48:28.105 --> 48:29.573
Ghost Realtor.

48:29.607 --> 48:30.908
Oh, yeah.

48:30.941 --> 48:32.510
That one was really funny.

48:32.543 --> 48:34.045
Thank you, Maci.

48:34.078 --> 48:36.380
That's really nice of you to say.

48:36.414 --> 48:38.516
I had a really fun evening with Maci,

48:38.549 --> 48:41.952
and after the hour was up, I
knew I wanted to see her again.

48:41.986 --> 48:44.889
So over the next week,
I set up a couple more dates.

48:44.922 --> 48:46.957
Happy birthday.

48:46.991 --> 48:48.759
Thank you.

48:48.793 --> 48:50.428
I did it right, right?

48:50.461 --> 48:52.430
- You did. You're learning.
- Okay.

48:52.463 --> 48:54.899
This is the type of place
you'd propose to someone.

48:54.932 --> 48:56.600
Oh, you're not gonna propose, are you?

48:56.634 --> 48:57.935
No, I'm not.

48:57.968 --> 49:00.004
Okay, good.

49:00.037 --> 49:01.439
I'm just saying, it's the
type, you know what I mean.

49:01.472 --> 49:02.606
It is kind of the type of place.

49:02.640 --> 49:03.808
Yeah.

49:03.841 --> 49:04.875
You have a nice laugh.

49:04.909 --> 49:06.477
I actually hate my laugh.

49:06.510 --> 49:07.745
- Really?
- Yeah.

49:07.778 --> 49:09.080
I think you have a nice laugh.

49:09.113 --> 49:10.681
It's awkward, I don't know.

49:10.715 --> 49:11.882
No, you have a nice laugh.

49:11.916 --> 49:13.117
Well, thank you.

49:13.150 --> 49:15.419
You're welcome.

49:20.297 --> 49:21.598
- Bye, Maci.
- Bye.

49:21.631 --> 49:23.033
Okay, see you soon.

49:23.066 --> 49:25.235
See ya.

49:25.268 --> 49:27.204
We had been in Arkansas
for several weeks now

49:27.237 --> 49:29.272
and I was starting to lose sight

49:29.306 --> 49:31.208
of what I was even doing here.

49:31.241 --> 49:35.078
I felt unfocused, just filming
things for no reason

49:35.112 --> 49:37.714
in the hope something
interesting might happen.

49:37.748 --> 49:40.617
We had accumulated
hundreds of hours of footage

49:40.650 --> 49:42.719
but I couldn't tell
if this search for Frances

49:42.753 --> 49:44.087
would amount to anything.

49:44.148 --> 49:46.950
Can you switch to Fox News?

49:46.957 --> 49:50.624
A part of me wondered if Bill
was just a bored old man

49:50.686 --> 49:53.687
looking for an adventure
to keep himself busy

49:53.764 --> 49:56.933
or maybe when you priortized
your career for to long

49:56.967 --> 49:59.102
you just become desperate
for any human connection.

50:03.240 --> 50:04.908
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

50:04.941 --> 50:06.677
Okay.

50:06.710 --> 50:08.612
Apparently they shot
"Gone with the Wind" here.

50:08.645 --> 50:10.781
I've never seen it.

50:10.814 --> 50:12.649
And the more we kept shooting things,

50:12.683 --> 50:15.018
the harder it was to tell
where the show ended

50:15.052 --> 50:16.753
and life began.

50:16.787 --> 50:19.623
Just do it again.

50:22.259 --> 50:23.627
Okay, do it again.

50:23.660 --> 50:25.262
No, only twice.

50:25.295 --> 50:26.997
You want me to hold your hand?

50:27.030 --> 50:28.231
Do you want to hold my hand?

50:28.265 --> 50:30.033
Do you want to hold my hand?

50:30.067 --> 50:31.335
Kind of, yeah.

50:31.368 --> 50:32.936
- Okay.
- All right.

50:32.969 --> 50:33.970
Your hands are cold.

50:34.004 --> 50:35.672
I know.

50:35.706 --> 50:37.307
Does that make you uncomfortable?

50:37.341 --> 50:40.440
- No.
- Okay.

50:40.518 --> 50:41.378
I like it.

50:41.411 --> 50:43.914
Good.

50:43.947 --> 50:45.982
Near the end of one of our hangouts,

50:46.016 --> 50:48.734
Maci asked if I wanted our next date

50:48.812 --> 50:50.153
to be a little more private.

50:50.187 --> 50:52.122
You just let me know.

50:52.155 --> 50:54.024
Let you know what?

50:54.057 --> 50:55.826
That that's what you want to do.

50:55.859 --> 50:57.961
So I just... just let you know...

50:57.994 --> 50:59.796
Yeah.

50:59.830 --> 51:00.931
What I want and then...

51:00.964 --> 51:03.800
Yeah.

51:09.973 --> 51:11.875
- Okay.
- Okay.

51:45.442 --> 51:46.877
- Hello.
- Hey, how are you?

51:46.910 --> 51:48.011
Hey. Good. How are you?

51:48.045 --> 51:49.246
Good. Nice to see you.

51:49.279 --> 51:50.881

52:54.211 --> 52:56.179
Okay. Good.

53:35.152 --> 53:37.020
I like you.

53:37.054 --> 53:39.890
I like you, too.

53:48.465 --> 53:49.833
Really?

53:49.866 --> 53:52.502
Yeah.

54:04.414 --> 54:06.383
Cool.

54:21.198 --> 54:23.900
We had been contacting local cemeteries

54:23.934 --> 54:26.069
to see if they had anyone with
the last name Gaddy

54:26.103 --> 54:27.938
buried there.

54:27.971 --> 54:31.274
At first, we weren't getting
much traction,

54:31.308 --> 54:34.945
but then a promising lead emerged.

54:34.978 --> 54:37.914
We discovered that there was
a Gaddy family grave plot

54:37.948 --> 54:39.249
on the outskirts of Dumas.

54:39.282 --> 54:41.385
Here it is.

54:41.418 --> 54:43.220
It wasn't Frances,

54:43.253 --> 54:44.955
but after Bill took a closer look,

54:44.988 --> 54:46.923
the name seemed to ring a bell.

54:46.957 --> 54:49.326
Well, now that I'm looking at the names

54:49.359 --> 54:51.061
and the dates here,

54:51.094 --> 54:53.030
it's a possibility
it could be her parents.

54:53.063 --> 54:56.400
I vaguely remember her father's name.

54:56.433 --> 54:58.402
What was it?

54:58.435 --> 55:00.270
Well, I thought it was Robert.

55:00.303 --> 55:02.272
I don't know about Crews.

55:02.305 --> 55:04.541
If Bill was remembering correctly,

55:04.574 --> 55:07.477
and this was
Frances' father's gravestone,

55:07.511 --> 55:10.280
there's a chance his obituary
would contain information

55:10.313 --> 55:12.616
about any surviving children.

55:12.649 --> 55:15.619
So the next day we headed to
the Little Rock Public Library

55:15.652 --> 55:17.254
to look at their newspaper archives

55:17.287 --> 55:19.322
from 1982.

55:19.356 --> 55:21.091
That's it? Yeah.

55:21.124 --> 55:22.325
- Okay.
- See, that goes under there,

55:22.359 --> 55:25.228
under the glass, and then under here.

55:26.930 --> 55:28.532
- Like that?
- Yeah.

55:35.372 --> 55:38.241
Oh, wait, here it is.

55:38.275 --> 55:42.279
Robert Crews Gaddy age 63,

55:42.312 --> 55:43.914
of Texarkana, Texas,

55:43.947 --> 55:45.682
formerly of Little Rock.

55:45.716 --> 55:48.618
Survivors are two daughters,

55:48.652 --> 55:51.221
Frances Munroe

55:51.254 --> 55:55.359
of North Musk... Muskegon, Michigan.

55:55.392 --> 55:57.294
With this information,

55:57.327 --> 55:59.363
we were able to track down
the Facebook page

55:59.396 --> 56:02.666
of a Fran Munroe who
lived in Bellaire, Michigan.

56:04.634 --> 56:06.436
My God.

56:06.470 --> 56:08.472
You think that's her?

56:08.505 --> 56:10.040
Oh, my God, Bill.

56:10.073 --> 56:11.308
Oh!

56:11.341 --> 56:13.010
Look, Dumas Senior High.

56:13.043 --> 56:15.412
Yeah. That's gotta be her right now.

56:17.147 --> 56:18.982
- Class of 1959.
- Mm-hmm.

56:19.016 --> 56:19.716
- That's her.
- That's her.

56:19.750 --> 56:21.251
100%.

56:21.284 --> 56:23.020
I would say 100%.

56:23.053 --> 56:25.355
I had to admit that even at 76,

56:25.389 --> 56:27.657
she was stunning

56:27.691 --> 56:30.694
and surprisingly similar to
Cornelius' age progression.

56:30.727 --> 56:34.264
I can't believe they got this up.

56:36.433 --> 56:37.968
Look at you.

56:38.001 --> 56:39.336
You look like a schoolboy again.

56:41.104 --> 56:43.040
Golly.

56:43.073 --> 56:44.174
Whoo!

56:44.207 --> 56:46.076
But then we found something

56:46.109 --> 56:47.177
that put a damper on Bill's excitement.

56:47.210 --> 56:49.279
That's her husband.

56:49.312 --> 56:51.682
Shoot.

56:56.787 --> 56:59.690
Let's see what he looks like, though.

56:59.723 --> 57:02.225
We had always known
this was a possibility,

57:02.259 --> 57:04.161
but it seemed to bring out
a side of Bill

57:04.194 --> 57:06.096
that I had never seen before.

57:06.129 --> 57:09.232
She could have done better than that.

57:09.266 --> 57:13.036
He's not Mr. Good Looking,
I don't think.

57:13.070 --> 57:15.105
Well, that's not very nice to say.

57:15.138 --> 57:19.242
I'm sorry,
but I didn't mean it that way.

57:19.276 --> 57:21.745
He looks like he's overweight.

57:21.778 --> 57:24.648
Bill became fixated on Frances' husband.

57:24.681 --> 57:27.050
He's an attorney.

57:27.084 --> 57:29.686
BA in English, football, track captain,

57:29.720 --> 57:31.021
glee club.

57:31.054 --> 57:34.057
Gee.

57:34.091 --> 57:37.094
I should have married her.

57:37.127 --> 57:39.396
Should have married her.

57:39.429 --> 57:41.365
And he started to get ideas in his head.

57:41.398 --> 57:43.667
Well, we go to Michigan.

57:43.700 --> 57:45.035
- What?
- We go there.

57:45.068 --> 57:47.437
Meet her in person.

57:47.471 --> 57:51.108
Rehash what should have been.

57:51.141 --> 57:54.144
But she's married now.

57:54.177 --> 57:57.214
She could get a divorce and marry me.

58:00.784 --> 58:02.819
Okay.

58:08.625 --> 58:11.395
Oh, all right.

58:13.330 --> 58:15.465
She loved me to her grave.

58:15.499 --> 58:17.367
She said it,

58:17.401 --> 58:21.371
and that old saying,
it's never too late.

58:21.405 --> 58:23.106
I didn't really know what to make

58:23.140 --> 58:25.275
of what Bill was telling me.

58:25.308 --> 58:28.712
He seemed undeterred by the
fact that Frances had a husband

58:28.745 --> 58:30.614
and just kept repeating
the promise she had made to him

58:30.647 --> 58:33.116
nearly 60 years ago.

58:33.150 --> 58:36.119
That's pretty strong words,
I'll love you to my grave.

58:36.153 --> 58:38.455
Well, she said she would love me
to her grave.

58:38.488 --> 58:40.824
Isn't that pretty strong love?

58:40.857 --> 58:45.295
Remember, she said
she'd love me to her grave.

58:45.328 --> 58:47.497
And for the first time
since agreeing to help Bill,

58:47.531 --> 58:50.211
I didn't know what to do.

58:51.250 --> 58:53.756
Bill was dead set on going to Michigan

58:53.790 --> 58:56.192
to profess his love to Frances.

58:56.225 --> 58:58.194
I knew he felt strongly about her,

58:58.227 --> 59:00.396
but I hadn't considered the possibility

59:00.430 --> 59:02.965
that Bill would try to get her
to divorce her husband.

59:02.999 --> 59:06.002
Do you think there's a chance
she'd do that?

59:06.035 --> 59:07.370
There's a chance.

59:07.403 --> 59:10.239
It's the roll of the dice.

59:10.273 --> 59:12.542
7 come 11.

59:12.575 --> 59:15.344
My gut was telling me that
this was a bad idea

59:15.378 --> 59:17.647
and that Bill's chances of
succeeding were slim.

59:17.680 --> 59:19.449
But who knows?

59:19.482 --> 59:21.584
Frances' love for Bill in those letters

59:21.617 --> 59:23.519
seemed so deep.

59:23.553 --> 59:25.054
Maybe after all these years

59:25.087 --> 59:27.657
she felt the same regret he did.

59:27.690 --> 59:30.126
Regardless, if Bill really
wanted to surprise Frances

59:30.159 --> 59:31.494
at her front door,

59:31.527 --> 59:33.496
I felt obligated to make sure

59:33.529 --> 59:35.665
he was putting his best foot forward.

59:35.698 --> 59:38.234
So I found a professional actress online

59:38.267 --> 59:41.571
who closely resembled
Frances' look and age

59:41.604 --> 59:43.506
to be Bill's rehearsal partner.

59:43.539 --> 59:45.608
I then arranged with
a local theater company

59:45.641 --> 59:46.742
who is currently staging a production

59:46.776 --> 59:49.011
of "Young Frankenstein"

59:49.045 --> 59:51.047
to let us use their venue
as a practice space

59:51.080 --> 59:52.748
during one of their days off,

59:52.782 --> 59:55.518
and using some furniture
we found backstage,

59:55.551 --> 59:59.255
we created a makeshift set
to play as Frances' home.

59:59.288 --> 01:00:02.525
Bye the time June, our actress,
arrived from Los Angeles,

01:00:02.558 --> 01:00:05.027
she had studied up on Frances' letters,

01:00:05.061 --> 01:00:07.230
which I had given her
so she'd have a better sense

01:00:07.263 --> 01:00:09.031
of the woman she'd be portraying.

01:00:09.065 --> 01:00:12.568
He disappointed her and... and hurt her.

01:00:12.602 --> 01:00:15.204
And before long, it was time
for her to meet the man

01:00:15.238 --> 01:00:17.173
she had read so much about.

01:00:17.206 --> 01:00:19.108
Oh, hi, Bill.

01:00:19.142 --> 01:00:21.110
June is the actress that
will be playing Frances.

01:00:21.144 --> 01:00:22.779
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Pleasure.

01:00:22.812 --> 01:00:25.581
What do you think?
Is the look pretty accurate?

01:00:25.615 --> 01:00:26.783
- Yes.
- Yeah?

01:00:26.816 --> 01:00:28.317
Not bad.

01:00:29.552 --> 01:00:31.187
- Not bad.
- Okay.

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:32.588
- Of course, it's not...
- You've got nice teeth.

01:00:32.622 --> 01:00:34.290
- Thank you.
- You've got nice teeth.

01:00:34.323 --> 01:00:36.058
It's so long since
you've seen her, right?

01:00:36.092 --> 01:00:38.227
Ooh, look at her teeth. Look at 'em.

01:00:38.261 --> 01:00:40.129
You've got 'em all. They're yours.

01:00:40.163 --> 01:00:41.264
- Yes, they're mine.
- Nothing fake.

01:00:41.297 --> 01:00:44.267
They're mine. They're all mine.

01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:46.335
Right away, I began to see
the side of Bill

01:00:46.369 --> 01:00:49.338
that Frances had alluded to
in her letters

01:00:49.372 --> 01:00:51.407
and I knew we had a lot of work
ahead of us.

01:00:51.441 --> 01:00:53.676
For our initial run-through,

01:00:53.709 --> 01:00:56.312
I asked Bill to show me
what he was thinking of doing

01:00:56.345 --> 01:00:58.448
when he arrived at Frances' home,

01:00:58.481 --> 01:01:01.184
and then we would adjust
from there if necessary.

01:01:01.217 --> 01:01:03.619
All right, so, Bill, you're
arriving at Frances' door.

01:01:03.653 --> 01:01:05.455
This is the first time
you've seen her in 50 years.

01:01:05.488 --> 01:01:07.020
Okay, ready?

01:01:07.091 --> 01:01:08.558
And action.

01:01:15.832 --> 01:01:18.468
Frances, God, I can't believe it's you!

01:01:18.501 --> 01:01:20.470
Bill, oh, my God!

01:01:20.503 --> 01:01:22.772
It's been so long.

01:01:22.805 --> 01:01:24.640
Is it really you?

01:01:24.674 --> 01:01:26.809
Man.

01:01:26.843 --> 01:01:29.112
Oh. Oh, my goodness.

01:01:29.145 --> 01:01:31.647
I can't believe it's you.

01:01:33.449 --> 01:01:34.817
All these years.

01:01:34.851 --> 01:01:36.853
I know, I know, I know. Sit.

01:01:36.886 --> 01:01:39.355
We should have married.
Why didn't you marry me?

01:01:39.388 --> 01:01:42.759
So, Bill, tell me all about yourself.

01:01:42.792 --> 01:01:44.827
Now, easy on. It's been 47 years now.

01:01:44.861 --> 01:01:47.597
I'm a married woman,
so just take it easy.

01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:49.632
Just take it slow.

01:01:49.665 --> 01:01:51.534
I just want... Now...

01:01:51.567 --> 01:01:53.836
Okay, pause.

01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:57.774
Bill, can I ask you why you
rubbed her leg like that?

01:01:57.807 --> 01:01:59.809
Where? Her leg?

01:01:59.842 --> 01:02:03.746
Yeah.

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:06.182
I don't know. It's just...

01:02:06.215 --> 01:02:08.484
June, as Frances, how do you
think she would feel

01:02:08.518 --> 01:02:10.010
if he touched her?

01:02:10.158 --> 01:02:12.188
Uncomfortable.

01:02:12.221 --> 01:02:14.190
The first run-through was troubling.

01:02:14.223 --> 01:02:16.559
Bill's initial attempts
to win over Frances

01:02:16.592 --> 01:02:18.361
came across as either creepy...

01:02:18.394 --> 01:02:19.562
Is your husband a jealous man?

01:02:19.595 --> 01:02:21.164
Or desperate.

01:02:21.197 --> 01:02:24.534
But I'm asking you again
to marry me, please.

01:02:24.567 --> 01:02:26.869
He just couldn't engage with Frances

01:02:26.903 --> 01:02:28.571
like a normal human being.

01:02:28.604 --> 01:02:30.373
Surprise!

01:02:30.406 --> 01:02:32.542
And bringing in our "Mud 2" actor

01:02:32.575 --> 01:02:35.545
to play her husband only seemed
to make things worse.

01:02:35.578 --> 01:02:37.713
I'm here to marry...

01:02:37.747 --> 01:02:39.215
- My wife.
- Your wife.

01:02:39.248 --> 01:02:40.249
Do you understand... But she's my wife.

01:02:40.283 --> 01:02:41.884
English?

01:02:41.918 --> 01:02:43.753
He was just unable to see the situation

01:02:43.786 --> 01:02:45.688
from Frances' perspective.

01:02:45.721 --> 01:02:48.391
And worst of all, our Frances stand-in

01:02:48.424 --> 01:02:49.592
was not convinced.

01:02:49.625 --> 01:02:52.395
You should be a little bit more...

01:02:52.428 --> 01:02:54.564
understanding,

01:02:54.597 --> 01:02:57.667
'cause if you push that
on her too fast...

01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:59.235
- Yeah, that could be bad.
- You know what I mean?

01:02:59.268 --> 01:03:01.370
You know, be more like a gentleman.

01:03:01.404 --> 01:03:02.772
So to help Bill better understand

01:03:02.805 --> 01:03:04.540
what Frances might be feeling,

01:03:04.574 --> 01:03:07.543
we decided to do
a role-reversal exercise

01:03:07.577 --> 01:03:09.912
using a wig I picked up
from a store down the block.

01:03:09.946 --> 01:03:12.348
You don't know how
I've cried myself to sleep

01:03:12.381 --> 01:03:14.484
thinking of you.

01:03:14.517 --> 01:03:16.619
Losing sleep for hours.

01:03:16.652 --> 01:03:19.255
I'm sorry, Frances.

01:03:19.288 --> 01:03:21.591
Well, it's like when
a person kills somebody,

01:03:21.624 --> 01:03:24.360
they're sorry, but that doesn't
bring 'em back to life.

01:03:24.393 --> 01:03:27.563
After embodying Frances
for nearly an hour,

01:03:27.597 --> 01:03:29.699
it seemed to give Bill
some new perspective.

01:03:29.732 --> 01:03:32.435
Never heard from you, write you letters,

01:03:32.468 --> 01:03:34.604
call you on the phone,

01:03:34.637 --> 01:03:36.873
ignore the calls.

01:03:36.906 --> 01:03:38.875
All you wanted was the career,

01:03:38.908 --> 01:03:40.910
the career in Hollywood.

01:03:40.943 --> 01:03:44.547
You were just doing it for yourself.

01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:47.583
Self-centered.

01:03:47.617 --> 01:03:50.253
And once he switched back
to himself again,

01:03:50.286 --> 01:03:52.555
a softer side of Bill seemed to emerge.

01:03:52.588 --> 01:03:56.426
I cheated on you.

01:03:56.459 --> 01:03:59.829
I kept you misleading
that we were gonna marry.

01:03:59.862 --> 01:04:02.832
I didn't answer your letters.

01:04:02.865 --> 01:04:05.468
I've been living with regret

01:04:05.501 --> 01:04:08.504
how I've... it was really hard.

01:04:08.538 --> 01:04:10.907
I know you have a happy family,

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:12.775
a nice home,

01:04:12.809 --> 01:04:15.812
and happily married,

01:04:15.845 --> 01:04:18.014
but I would be lying

01:04:18.047 --> 01:04:20.683
if I said I didn't have
feelings for you,

01:04:20.716 --> 01:04:23.286
because I do.

01:04:23.319 --> 01:04:25.888
I just want you to know, Frances,

01:04:25.922 --> 01:04:28.891
that I really love you so much.

01:04:30.893 --> 01:04:32.495
By then end of rehearsal,

01:04:32.528 --> 01:04:34.797
I felt like Bill had made huge strides.

01:04:39.535 --> 01:04:41.471
And even June was feeling optimistic

01:04:41.504 --> 01:04:43.873
about his chances
of winning over Frances.

01:04:43.906 --> 01:04:45.808
I think there's a possibility,

01:04:45.842 --> 01:04:47.710
and of course, there's
a stronger possibility

01:04:47.743 --> 01:04:51.481
if she's not in a happy marriage.

01:04:51.514 --> 01:04:53.649
But of course, you know,
one doesn't know that

01:04:53.683 --> 01:04:56.719
until the actual time comes.

01:04:56.752 --> 01:04:59.589
It was hard to know exactly
how things would play out

01:04:59.622 --> 01:05:00.790
on the day,

01:05:00.823 --> 01:05:02.558
but we'd soon find out

01:05:02.592 --> 01:05:04.393
because it was time to go to Michigan.

01:05:04.427 --> 01:05:05.695
- Love you.
- Bye, Shelly.

01:05:05.728 --> 01:05:07.063
Love you.

01:05:07.096 --> 01:05:08.998
Okay. Well, good luck.

01:05:09.031 --> 01:05:10.399
Let me know how it goes.

01:05:10.433 --> 01:05:11.801
Thank you.

01:05:11.834 --> 01:05:13.069
I know.

01:05:15.772 --> 01:05:17.807
Oh. Are you okay?

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:18.941
Yeah.

01:05:18.975 --> 01:05:21.711
Are you sure?

01:05:25.381 --> 01:05:26.582
You gonna be okay?

01:05:26.616 --> 01:05:27.750
It's gonna be okay.

01:05:27.784 --> 01:05:29.852
It is. It's gonna be okay.

01:05:29.886 --> 01:05:31.587
So you never know.

01:05:31.621 --> 01:05:33.489
You never know
what you'll find up there.

01:05:33.523 --> 01:05:34.824
That's right.

01:05:34.857 --> 01:05:36.526
So.

01:05:45.134 --> 01:05:47.904
We headed to the airport
and boarded our flight

01:05:47.937 --> 01:05:49.972
for the 950-mile trip north

01:05:50.006 --> 01:05:53.709
to Traverse City, Michigan.

01:05:53.743 --> 01:05:56.712
By the time we arrived,
it was getting late,

01:05:56.746 --> 01:05:59.615
so we decided to head to
the hotel and call it a night

01:05:59.649 --> 01:06:01.417
with a plan to go to Frances' house

01:06:01.451 --> 01:06:04.120
first thing in the morning.

01:06:04.153 --> 01:06:05.588
And that's why I'm introducing

01:06:05.621 --> 01:06:07.657
comprehensive immigration reform

01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:09.992
within the first 100 days
with a path to citizenship.

01:06:10.026 --> 01:06:12.028
Thank you, Secretary Clinton.

01:06:12.061 --> 01:06:13.463
I wanted to follow up...

01:06:13.496 --> 01:06:15.098
Look at the...

01:06:15.131 --> 01:06:17.100
Yeah?

01:06:19.469 --> 01:06:21.704
He's... he's the man for the presidency,

01:06:21.737 --> 01:06:23.072
I'm telling you.

01:06:23.106 --> 01:06:26.709
I've told you that before.

01:06:26.742 --> 01:06:29.545
Donald H. Trump,

01:06:29.579 --> 01:06:32.782
I believe is his middle initial,
isn't it?

01:06:32.815 --> 01:06:34.584
I think it's J.

01:06:34.617 --> 01:06:35.952
Huh?

01:06:35.985 --> 01:06:38.421
Why are you telling me this?

01:06:38.454 --> 01:06:39.689
Well, I'm trying to convince you

01:06:39.722 --> 01:06:41.090
that Trump is the man.

01:06:41.124 --> 01:06:44.827
You seem to think he's not gonna win.

01:06:44.861 --> 01:06:47.096
Well, he's losing in the polls.

01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:49.899
You can't go by the polls.

01:06:49.932 --> 01:06:52.502
What can you go by?

01:06:52.535 --> 01:06:53.770
I'd like to hear from... I'd
like to hear from Secretary...

01:06:53.803 --> 01:06:55.671
Election day.

01:06:55.705 --> 01:06:57.807
I voted for border security
and there are...

01:06:59.742 --> 01:07:01.844
The next morning as Bill got ready,

01:07:01.878 --> 01:07:05.148
I copied down Frances' address
and phone number

01:07:05.181 --> 01:07:06.783
from the online Whitepages.

01:07:09.152 --> 01:07:11.621
Bill didn't say a word to me
that entire morning.

01:07:11.654 --> 01:07:13.923
I could tell there was
a lot on his mind.

01:07:16.659 --> 01:07:18.060
It's funny how the more
comfortable you get

01:07:18.094 --> 01:07:20.129
with someone,

01:07:20.163 --> 01:07:22.732
the less you feel the need
to fill the silence with talk.

01:07:43.119 --> 01:07:46.089
What are you thinking?

01:07:46.122 --> 01:07:48.157
Well, I'm just thinking.

01:07:56.265 --> 01:07:57.633
Bill?

01:07:57.667 --> 01:07:59.168
Mm-hmm.

01:07:59.202 --> 01:08:01.104
What are you thinking about?

01:08:01.137 --> 01:08:04.707
Oh, I'm just...

01:08:40.917 --> 01:08:42.653
Frances' address

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:44.321
took us to a small, wooded neighborhood

01:08:44.354 --> 01:08:45.488
off of Lake Michigan.

01:08:47.491 --> 01:08:49.093
The plan was for Bill to go to the door

01:08:49.126 --> 01:08:51.328
by himself at first while we hung back

01:08:51.362 --> 01:08:53.363
so she wouldn't be startled
by the cameras.

01:08:53.397 --> 01:08:56.433
This is it.

01:09:00.604 --> 01:09:02.372
It's right down there.

01:09:02.406 --> 01:09:05.042
Oh. Okay.

01:09:13.517 --> 01:09:14.919
It's right down there.

01:09:14.952 --> 01:09:16.120
Yeah.

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:22.059
Oh, Lord. God have mercy.

01:09:26.831 --> 01:09:28.832
But when it came time to get out,

01:09:28.866 --> 01:09:30.835
Bill didn't want to go down without us.

01:09:30.868 --> 01:09:32.536
Well, I thought wouldn't
you want it that way

01:09:32.569 --> 01:09:34.939
with the cameras?

01:09:34.971 --> 01:09:37.942
Well, it seems like
a personal moment for you.

01:09:37.975 --> 01:09:39.609
Oh, bring the cameras.

01:09:39.643 --> 01:09:42.680
I like all the PR.

01:09:46.917 --> 01:09:48.953
You heard it, the PR.

01:09:48.986 --> 01:09:50.787
What do you mean?

01:09:50.821 --> 01:09:54.425
Public relations, PR.

01:09:54.458 --> 01:09:57.027
And it concerned me
that Bill didn't realize

01:09:57.061 --> 01:09:59.497
how showing up at her front
door with a camera crew

01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:01.031
might freak her out.

01:10:01.065 --> 01:10:03.400
What do you think it'll be like for her?

01:10:03.434 --> 01:10:05.169
I... she wouldn't mind it.

01:10:05.202 --> 01:10:07.004
The cameras?

01:10:07.037 --> 01:10:09.440
Right.

01:10:09.473 --> 01:10:11.008
If he really wanted to
go down there with the crew,

01:10:11.041 --> 01:10:13.711
I suggested that he call her first.

01:10:13.744 --> 01:10:16.981
We could. You have her number?

01:10:17.014 --> 01:10:19.517
So I moved our car
out of sight around the corner

01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:22.553
and dialed Frances' number
into Bill's phone

01:10:22.586 --> 01:10:26.123
so he could make the call.

01:10:26.157 --> 01:10:27.158
You ready?

01:10:27.191 --> 01:10:30.027
Ready.

01:10:39.537 --> 01:10:41.839
Hello?

01:10:41.872 --> 01:10:43.607
Hello, Frances?

01:10:43.641 --> 01:10:44.708
Yes.

01:10:44.742 --> 01:10:45.843
How are you?

01:10:45.876 --> 01:10:47.478
Fine. Who's calling?

01:10:47.511 --> 01:10:49.814
Well, I want you to guess.

01:10:49.847 --> 01:10:51.482
Oh, I can't.

01:10:51.515 --> 01:10:54.084
I don't know.

01:10:54.118 --> 01:10:55.953
Well, you think hard.

01:10:55.986 --> 01:10:58.823
Doesn't my voice sound familiar to you?

01:11:00.624 --> 01:11:02.526
No.

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.061
No?

01:11:04.094 --> 01:11:05.729
No.

01:11:05.763 --> 01:11:08.799
It's been a long time, Frances.

01:11:11.101 --> 01:11:12.970
Yeah, you've got me wondering now.

01:11:13.003 --> 01:11:16.207
Who is this?

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:17.775
Hello?

01:11:17.808 --> 01:11:19.043
Yeah, I'm here.

01:11:19.076 --> 01:11:21.078
Okay.

01:11:21.111 --> 01:11:22.480
Uh...

01:11:22.513 --> 01:11:23.581
Tell her.

01:11:23.614 --> 01:11:25.216
You don't know who I am?

01:11:25.249 --> 01:11:27.251
Think hard.

01:11:27.284 --> 01:11:30.621
I don't sound familiar to you?

01:11:30.654 --> 01:11:32.890
No.

01:11:32.923 --> 01:11:34.859
Oh, wait a minute.

01:11:34.892 --> 01:11:36.760
Is this Jim Beckley?

01:11:36.794 --> 01:11:38.262
Who?

01:11:38.295 --> 01:11:39.530
Beckley?

01:11:39.563 --> 01:11:40.664
No.

01:11:40.698 --> 01:11:42.766
No?

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.636
Oh.

01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:46.537
Tell her who you are.

01:11:46.570 --> 01:11:48.005
Yeah.

01:11:48.038 --> 01:11:51.575
All right, I'm gonna tell you who I am.

01:11:51.609 --> 01:11:52.676
Okay.

01:11:52.710 --> 01:11:55.746
Bill Heath.

01:11:57.581 --> 01:11:59.216
Hello?

01:11:59.250 --> 01:12:00.551
Hello.

01:12:00.584 --> 01:12:02.620
Bill Heath.

01:12:02.653 --> 01:12:04.622
Bill Heath?

01:12:08.159 --> 01:12:09.927
Okay. Hi, Bill, how are you?

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:12.229
You remember me now, don't you?

01:12:12.263 --> 01:12:14.698
Yes, I do. Of course I do.

01:12:14.732 --> 01:12:16.801
Well, what are you up to?

01:12:16.834 --> 01:12:19.036
Oh, trying to do right.

01:12:20.838 --> 01:12:23.207
Okay, is that hard?

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:26.277
So... but I, you know,
I've been thinking about you

01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:30.047
a lot of the times and I said finally,

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:32.817
you know, I'm just gonna call you

01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:34.618
and... Okay.

01:12:34.652 --> 01:12:36.320
So...

01:12:36.353 --> 01:12:38.255
So what's going on in your life?

01:12:38.289 --> 01:12:40.090
I'm out in LA now,

01:12:40.124 --> 01:12:42.893
still working as an actor out there.

01:12:42.927 --> 01:12:45.596
Well, good for you.

01:12:45.629 --> 01:12:47.331
- Good for you.
- So...

01:12:47.364 --> 01:12:49.266
That's what you always wanted to do.

01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:51.035
Right.

01:12:51.068 --> 01:12:52.870
Do you have any children?

01:12:52.903 --> 01:12:55.673
No, I...

01:12:55.706 --> 01:12:58.042
I should have married you maybe.

01:12:58.075 --> 01:12:59.877
You know... you know how it is.

01:13:02.046 --> 01:13:04.915
Well, I have nine grandchildren.

01:13:04.949 --> 01:13:06.317
Really?

01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:08.786
- Yes.
- So...

01:13:08.819 --> 01:13:12.890
No, I'm a... I'm a grandmother
with nine grandchildren,

01:13:12.923 --> 01:13:16.694
and we have twin granddaughters

01:13:16.727 --> 01:13:20.331
that are almost three years old.

01:13:20.364 --> 01:13:22.933
As the call went on, 15 minutes in,

01:13:22.967 --> 01:13:24.869
Bill still hadn't mentioned to Frances

01:13:24.902 --> 01:13:27.171
that he was right outside of her house.

01:13:27.204 --> 01:13:29.974
What do you remember most
about my mother?

01:13:30.007 --> 01:13:32.309
What do I remember most
about your mother?

01:13:32.343 --> 01:13:33.711
She didn't like me.

01:13:33.744 --> 01:13:36.013
Oh! What?

01:13:36.046 --> 01:13:37.148
She didn't.

01:13:37.181 --> 01:13:39.250
Why do you say that?

01:13:39.283 --> 01:13:41.652
Well, it's true.

01:13:41.685 --> 01:13:42.853
What makes you say that?

01:13:42.887 --> 01:13:44.755
Why would she say it?

01:13:44.789 --> 01:13:47.625
I don't know, but she... she didn't.

01:13:49.293 --> 01:13:52.363
Well, are you happy?

01:13:52.396 --> 01:13:55.666
Am I happy? Yes, I'm happy.

01:13:55.699 --> 01:13:57.668
Why?

01:13:57.701 --> 01:13:59.937
You're on your second marriage, right?

01:13:59.970 --> 01:14:03.107
Mm-hmm.

01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:05.943
Good grief. Doesn't seem possible.

01:14:05.976 --> 01:14:08.112
How many years has it been?

01:14:08.145 --> 01:14:09.880
Well, let's see.

01:14:09.914 --> 01:14:12.349
Dave and I have been married
for almost 47...

01:14:12.383 --> 01:14:15.719
oh, we have been married 47 years.

01:14:15.753 --> 01:14:19.757
Mm.

01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:21.892
Well, the years go by.

01:14:21.926 --> 01:14:23.928
Yeah, they do go by.

01:14:23.961 --> 01:14:26.063
The snap of a finger, they go by.

01:14:28.165 --> 01:14:30.434
Have you thought about me much
through the years?

01:14:30.468 --> 01:14:33.904
Of course.

01:14:33.938 --> 01:14:37.408
Do you ever want to pick up
the phone and call me?

01:14:37.441 --> 01:14:39.910
Of course.

01:14:39.944 --> 01:14:42.980
But you never did.

01:14:44.748 --> 01:14:48.285
Was it hard?

01:14:48.319 --> 01:14:49.787
Hello?

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:51.322
Hello.

01:14:51.355 --> 01:14:54.191
Was it hard to do that?

01:14:58.195 --> 01:14:59.830
Can you hear me, Frances?

01:14:59.864 --> 01:15:02.700
Yes, I can... Yes, I can hear you.

01:15:04.168 --> 01:15:06.971
Well...

01:15:07.004 --> 01:15:09.173
well, I just...

01:15:09.206 --> 01:15:10.975
you've been on my mind so much,

01:15:11.008 --> 01:15:13.110
and I just had to call you...

01:15:13.144 --> 01:15:14.945
Well, thank you.

01:15:14.979 --> 01:15:16.947
You know, just to hear your voice.

01:15:16.981 --> 01:15:20.351
My life is...

01:15:20.384 --> 01:15:24.455
it's cheered me up so.

01:15:24.488 --> 01:15:26.724
Well, good for you. Are you all right?

01:15:26.757 --> 01:15:28.492
Am I all right?

01:15:28.526 --> 01:15:30.494
Mm-hmm. Your health-wise?

01:15:30.528 --> 01:15:32.329
Yes.

01:15:32.363 --> 01:15:34.465
Knock on the wood.

01:15:37.268 --> 01:15:39.136
Well, listen, you take care of yourself.

01:15:39.170 --> 01:15:40.905
It's nice to hear from you

01:15:40.938 --> 01:15:43.073
and...

01:15:43.107 --> 01:15:45.209
may God bless you.

01:15:45.242 --> 01:15:47.444
And what was that again?

01:15:47.478 --> 01:15:49.446
I said, and may God bless you.

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:51.282
Oh, thank you. The same to you.

01:15:51.315 --> 01:15:52.983
Thank you, Bill.

01:15:53.017 --> 01:15:54.318
Bye-bye. God bless.

01:15:54.351 --> 01:15:58.055
Good-bye.

01:15:58.088 --> 01:16:01.225
All right.

01:16:01.258 --> 01:16:02.793
How do you feel?

01:16:02.827 --> 01:16:05.229
How do I feel?

01:16:05.262 --> 01:16:07.064
You know, about the conversation.

01:16:07.097 --> 01:16:08.332
How do you feel?

01:16:08.365 --> 01:16:11.001
You seemed more nervous than I...

01:16:11.035 --> 01:16:13.737
I wasn't nervous, was I?
I didn't seem nervous.

01:16:27.151 --> 01:16:29.019
Do you still want to go inside?

01:16:29.053 --> 01:16:30.387
No, I don't think so.

01:16:30.421 --> 01:16:32.957
I talked to her, that's enough.

01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:36.260
I couldn't marry her.
It wouldn't work now.

01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:42.133
Do you feel like she's over you?

01:16:46.437 --> 01:16:49.206
Well, she sounded like it,
like it was just memories or...

01:16:51.208 --> 01:16:53.244
She didn't even recognize my voice.

01:16:58.082 --> 01:16:59.049
You okay?

01:16:59.083 --> 01:17:01.352
Yeah.

01:17:01.385 --> 01:17:03.854
You want to go home?

01:17:03.888 --> 01:17:06.524
Yeah.

01:17:14.532 --> 01:17:16.433
When we got back to
the hotel that night,

01:17:16.467 --> 01:17:19.236
there was a bee on the loose...

01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:21.205
Oop!

01:17:21.238 --> 01:17:23.541
And Bill seemed determined to get it.

01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:37.922
He won't give up.

01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:40.424
Excuse me.

01:17:49.433 --> 01:17:53.437
All right, down the toilet.

01:17:53.471 --> 01:17:56.307
Good work.

01:17:57.744 --> 01:18:00.013
After spending so much time in Arkansas,

01:18:00.047 --> 01:18:03.121
I found myself digging my way
out of all the other work

01:18:03.168 --> 01:18:04.925
that had piled up in Los Angeles.

01:18:05.082 --> 01:18:06.925
I was working late hours

01:18:06.964 --> 01:18:09.886
and finding it hard to
adjust back to my routine.

01:18:10.074 --> 01:18:12.443
Bill wasn't really
on my mind much anymore.

01:18:12.477 --> 01:18:14.812
I think a part of me wanted to believe

01:18:14.846 --> 01:18:16.447
that he would find a happy ending,

01:18:16.481 --> 01:18:18.449
and when that didn't happen,

01:18:18.483 --> 01:18:20.251
it was a bit of a bummer.

01:18:20.285 --> 01:18:22.220
Then one day out of the blue,

01:18:22.253 --> 01:18:25.023
Bill asked to come by the
office to give me something.

01:18:25.056 --> 01:18:26.357
I got something for you.

01:18:26.391 --> 01:18:27.725
Really?

01:18:27.759 --> 01:18:28.993
This is for me?

01:18:29.027 --> 01:18:30.261
Yes.

01:18:30.295 --> 01:18:32.330
What is it?

01:18:32.363 --> 01:18:35.366
Wow. Thank you, Bill.

01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:38.436
Is this a serving tray?

01:18:38.469 --> 01:18:40.271
Yeah, you can put pasta on there,

01:18:40.305 --> 01:18:43.908
salads, anything.

01:18:43.942 --> 01:18:45.910
Wow.

01:18:45.944 --> 01:18:48.413
I know the salesman
and we picked it out.

01:18:48.446 --> 01:18:52.050
We thought that that would be

01:18:52.083 --> 01:18:53.952
appropriate for you.

01:18:53.985 --> 01:18:55.520
This is really sweet of you
to give this to me.

01:18:55.553 --> 01:18:57.755
Of course.

01:18:57.789 --> 01:19:01.459
That's a small token for what...
what you've done.

01:19:01.492 --> 01:19:03.828
I appreciate everything.

01:19:03.862 --> 01:19:05.830
The tray was really nice,
but I discovered

01:19:05.864 --> 01:19:07.832
that Bill wasn't just here
to say thanks.

01:19:07.866 --> 01:19:11.402
What are your thoughts on that
actress that came from LA

01:19:11.436 --> 01:19:13.538
to Arkansas?

01:19:13.571 --> 01:19:14.873
June?

01:19:14.906 --> 01:19:17.475
I thought she was good.

01:19:17.509 --> 01:19:19.244
Well, just...

01:19:19.277 --> 01:19:20.245
What do you mean?
What did you think of her?

01:19:20.278 --> 01:19:22.480
Well, you know.

01:19:22.514 --> 01:19:25.316
She'd be a good contact for me.

01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:26.885
Why are you smiling, Bill?

01:19:26.918 --> 01:19:28.887
I don't...

01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:30.488
Do you have a crush on her, Bill?

01:19:30.522 --> 01:19:32.490
I didn't say a crush on...

01:19:32.524 --> 01:19:34.058
Do you have a crush on June?

01:19:34.092 --> 01:19:35.960
I worked with her one time.

01:19:35.994 --> 01:19:38.062
Why are you laughing? Look at you, Bill.

01:19:38.096 --> 01:19:39.063
You're blushing.

01:19:39.097 --> 01:19:40.865
Oh, my God.

01:19:40.899 --> 01:19:43.334
I don't know what
her phone number is so.

01:19:43.368 --> 01:19:45.203
You want to call her right now?

01:19:45.236 --> 01:19:47.071
Yeah.

01:19:53.211 --> 01:19:55.013
Hello.

01:19:55.046 --> 01:19:56.214
June?

01:19:56.247 --> 01:19:57.315
Yes.

01:19:57.348 --> 01:19:59.017
How are you?

01:19:59.050 --> 01:20:00.985
I'm good. How are you?

01:20:01.019 --> 01:20:03.855
Do you know who you're speaking with?

01:20:06.391 --> 01:20:09.427
Is this Bill?

01:20:12.931 --> 01:20:15.166
Yeah, that's... this is Bill.

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:17.001
It's easy to look at someone else's life

01:20:17.035 --> 01:20:19.470
as a cautionary tale.

01:20:19.504 --> 01:20:23.174
After all, no one wants to be
old and filled with regret.

01:20:23.208 --> 01:20:24.309
Good grief.

01:20:24.342 --> 01:20:25.543
Oh, my goodness.

01:20:25.577 --> 01:20:27.178
Oh, how sharp you look.

01:20:27.212 --> 01:20:29.113
- Well, you look...
- Oh.

01:20:29.147 --> 01:20:31.316
Boy, you know, I'm gonna
compliment your teeth again.

01:20:31.349 --> 01:20:32.550
They're gorgeous.

01:20:34.419 --> 01:20:35.486
Let's toast to your teeth.

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:36.888
All right.

01:20:36.921 --> 01:20:38.356
My mother always told me, she said,

01:20:38.389 --> 01:20:40.525
"You get to that dentist
every six months, June."

01:20:40.558 --> 01:20:42.193
I said, "All right, Mom."

01:20:42.227 --> 01:20:44.229
But if you look closer and see that

01:20:44.262 --> 01:20:47.198
that life is filled with
moments of sincere joy,

01:20:47.232 --> 01:20:49.434
however fleeting,

01:20:49.467 --> 01:20:52.470
it's hard to say if it was
really a bad life after all.

01:20:52.504 --> 01:20:54.873
Anyways, I wanted to let you know

01:20:54.906 --> 01:20:56.875
that I booked my ticket yesterday.

01:20:56.908 --> 01:20:59.077
I'm really excited to see you.

01:20:59.110 --> 01:21:02.347
Yours, Nathan.

01:21:10.455 --> 01:21:11.556
Hey.

01:21:11.589 --> 01:21:14.526
Hey.

01:21:14.559 --> 01:21:15.627
Good to see you.

01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:17.295
Good to see you.

01:21:17.328 --> 01:21:18.396
- You want to hop...
- Can we sit up here?

01:21:18.429 --> 01:21:20.064
Sure, yeah.

01:21:20.098 --> 01:21:22.901
It's good to see you again.

01:21:22.934 --> 01:21:25.637
It's good to see you again.

01:21:25.670 --> 01:21:27.572
It's an interesting little place.

01:21:27.605 --> 01:21:31.109
On the map it was blue,

01:21:31.142 --> 01:21:34.179
so I thought it would be
a nice river, but...

01:21:34.212 --> 01:21:37.048
Yeah, I thought we were
gonna drive trucks.

01:21:37.081 --> 01:21:38.516
Yeah.

01:21:49.427 --> 01:21:51.129
You good with that?

01:21:51.162 --> 01:21:52.263
Mm-hmm.

01:21:52.297 --> 01:21:53.565
You and your super cold hands.

01:21:53.598 --> 01:21:55.333
Thanks for warming them up.

01:21:55.366 --> 01:21:58.269
No problem.

01:22:01.306 --> 01:22:04.075
It's kind of weird having
cameras around, right?

01:22:04.108 --> 01:22:06.978
We can turn them off if you want.

01:22:08.446 --> 01:22:10.148
Could we?

01:22:10.181 --> 01:22:11.149
Do you want to?

01:22:13.117 --> 01:22:14.619
I feel like that... does
that defeat the purpose maybe?
