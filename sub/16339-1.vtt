00:53.720 --> 00:54.948
You're still alive.

00:56.656 --> 00:58.715
English, Tortuga.

01:10.437 --> 01:11.461
You know where we are?

01:17.343 --> 01:20.141
You're here. Across the border.

01:21.815 --> 01:22.975
From El Fronteras.

01:24.017 --> 01:26.918
El Fronteras.
- Uh-huh.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.111
Is it far?

01:28.521 --> 01:31.046
- Quick walk.
- How long?

01:31.224 --> 01:35.251
Ten, 15 minutes.

01:40.867 --> 01:42.698
You'll like it... Aah! Un.

01:42.869 --> 01:45.133
You'll like it there.

01:46.239 --> 01:49.265
People are very friendly. Heh, heh.

01:52.178 --> 01:54.908
Why'd you have to start shooting, Tortuga?

01:55.081 --> 01:58.312
I didn't want to be taken alive.

02:02.155 --> 02:03.622
Huh?

02:20.840 --> 02:26.073
A man is only responsible to himself.

02:27.247 --> 02:29.977
<i>Remember that, perro.</i>

02:37.790 --> 02:39.587
Where will you go?

02:43.163 --> 02:44.255
Acapulco.

02:48.101 --> 02:50.934
Heh. Acapulco?
What are you, on spring break?

02:53.139 --> 02:55.130
That's for tourists.

02:55.308 --> 02:59.074
You want to go someplace nice.

02:59.546 --> 03:01.309
Go to...

03:02.282 --> 03:04.250
...Akumal.

03:14.761 --> 03:17.093
Take care of that bag, amigo.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.192
It carries the blood of many men.

03:30.510 --> 03:31.807
Adiós, Tortuga.

03:37.917 --> 03:39.384
Adiós.

04:44.684 --> 04:46.379
Come on.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.465
Hey.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.935
Leave the dog alone.

05:19.952 --> 05:21.579
Gringo.

05:32.732 --> 05:34.825
Shit.

06:11.571 --> 06:14.699
Hey, girl. How you doing?

06:17.777 --> 06:19.802
You're a good girl, huh?

06:21.314 --> 06:24.112
Go on. Get out of here.

06:26.152 --> 06:27.949
I said, go on.

06:33.092 --> 06:34.286
Whatever.

07:39.492 --> 07:40.652
Give me your bag.

07:45.565 --> 07:47.533
Excuse me?

07:48.968 --> 07:50.993
The bag.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.984
I'm not giving you the bag, kid.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.599
You're holding the knife wrong, honey.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.404
You're supposed to hold the knife
blade down.

08:35.147 --> 08:37.308
Someone comes at you blade up...

08:37.482 --> 08:39.883
...that means they don't know how
to handle a knife.

08:42.255 --> 08:43.552
And give me your shirt.

08:44.123 --> 08:46.614
<i>- What?
- Your camisa. Give it to me.</i>

08:49.896 --> 08:52.364
That's it. Come on.

08:55.601 --> 08:57.592
Thattagirl.

09:04.911 --> 09:06.879
Have a nice day.

09:41.314 --> 09:42.576
Bottle of water, please.

09:42.748 --> 09:43.976
- No water, sorry.
- No water?

09:45.985 --> 09:48.010
Excuse me, miss... Miss?

09:49.155 --> 09:51.214
Excuse me, sir?

09:52.491 --> 09:56.018
- No, I don't want your money. Please go.
- Please, ma'am, I'm very thirsty.

09:59.332 --> 10:00.856
Excuse me.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.594
Some water, please?

10:08.074 --> 10:10.440
We are closed.

10:14.046 --> 10:16.378
Come on, just one glass.

10:59.725 --> 11:01.352
Wow.

11:17.443 --> 11:19.877
Mm. Do you have any money?

11:52.945 --> 11:55.243
What, you don't take American money?

11:56.115 --> 11:58.447
I don't take fake money, hmm?

12:00.219 --> 12:01.880
- Fake?
- Mm.

12:02.621 --> 12:04.782
Come back here
when you have some real money.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.733
Two hundred dollars
for a glass of water. Ahem.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.063
Nope.

12:22.942 --> 12:25.968
Five hundred dollars for a glass of water.
That is my final offer.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.280
Mm.

13:13.359 --> 13:14.656
You can't drink that.

13:16.061 --> 13:17.426
You're a gringo.

13:18.931 --> 13:20.831
You ever hear of Montezuma's revenge?

13:30.576 --> 13:31.600
Mm.

14:22.428 --> 14:24.862
- You just killed your first man.
- Heh.

14:38.644 --> 14:40.737
Welcome to La M.

15:14.146 --> 15:15.408
Shh, shh.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.173
What's up, Flaca?

15:29.595 --> 15:31.256
<i>I jacked that vato that came into town.</i>

15:36.535 --> 15:38.264
What did you get?

15:43.709 --> 15:45.267
He broke your nose?

15:51.116 --> 15:53.175
What happened to your shirt?

15:55.287 --> 15:56.777
He took it.

15:57.990 --> 16:00.458
He stole the shirt off your back.

16:02.061 --> 16:03.358
<i>Shut the fuck up, putos.</i>

16:11.236 --> 16:13.704
Do you want to get jumped in?

16:19.511 --> 16:21.035
Hmm?

16:22.247 --> 16:24.909
You're going to have to do
better than that, flaquita.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.675
Hmm.

16:36.195 --> 16:40.564
Stray dogs.
They're the scourge of this town.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.360
Spreading disease and vermin.

16:43.469 --> 16:48.031
Ahh. If I do only one thing as chief,
it'll be to rid El Fronteras of these...

16:48.841 --> 16:51.241
...miserable, useless creatures.

16:51.977 --> 16:55.242
<i>And you pendejos are no better.</i>

16:58.450 --> 17:00.350
Shit.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.453
You heard the boss.

17:38.490 --> 17:41.015
Adiós, Fronteras.

18:02.481 --> 18:04.915
I'd like to take the next bus to Acapulco.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.517
Acapulco.

18:06.685 --> 18:08.152
<i>Sí, Acapulco.</i>

18:08.320 --> 18:11.414
Why you want to go there? Spring break?

18:13.392 --> 18:16.418
Look, can I just get a ticket
for the next bus, please?

18:16.962 --> 18:18.156
No.

18:18.564 --> 18:19.826
Why not?

18:19.998 --> 18:21.693
No bus to Acapulco.

18:22.768 --> 18:25.100
- No bus to Acapulco?
- Mm-hm.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.261
Okay, so...

18:27.639 --> 18:29.698
How do I get there? You tell me.

18:29.875 --> 18:31.570
No bus.

18:33.078 --> 18:34.545
Try tomorrow.

18:34.913 --> 18:38.349
Try tomorrow? Is there gonna be
a bus here tomorrow or not?

18:38.851 --> 18:39.875
Try tomorrow.

18:40.552 --> 18:42.543
Fuck!

18:50.262 --> 18:53.322
Okay, ma'am, I'm sorry. I apologize.

18:53.499 --> 18:56.366
But do you know where
I can get a glass of water?

19:01.306 --> 19:04.935
- Bus leaves at 2.
- No, there is no bus today.

19:11.650 --> 19:12.947
Of course there is.

19:13.118 --> 19:16.178
They only told you that so you could
stay in town longer and spend your money.

19:17.556 --> 19:19.854
- I gotta go.
- It's too late now.

19:20.025 --> 19:23.927
The bus leaves at 2:00 sharp.
You've missed it.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.434
Spend my money? On what?

19:30.602 --> 19:31.933
I can't even buy a glass of water.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.671
Where are you headed?

19:40.045 --> 19:41.342
<i>Acapulco.
Heh.</i>

19:41.513 --> 19:44.607
- Acapulco? That tourist trap?
- Yeah.

19:44.783 --> 19:49.743
Look, if you wanna go somewhere nice,
go to Tulum or Akumal.

19:50.556 --> 19:51.580
Acapulco.

19:53.525 --> 19:56.926
Hey, you wouldn't happen to have
a room upstairs I could spend the night?

19:57.095 --> 20:00.292
This seems to be the only place in town
that'll take my money.

20:03.302 --> 20:05.930
You can stay in the attic.

20:06.305 --> 20:08.796
For one night.

20:08.974 --> 20:12.171
Fronteras is not for tourists.

20:12.344 --> 20:16.041
You should leave here,
even if it is for Acapulco.

20:18.383 --> 20:19.714
You got a name?

20:23.522 --> 20:25.649
Come on, you can tell me your name.

20:26.258 --> 20:27.452
Anna.

20:27.726 --> 20:28.750
- Anna.
- Mm-hm.

20:29.428 --> 20:32.625
Well, Anna, you know
what I really want right now?

20:33.932 --> 20:35.399
What?

20:36.201 --> 20:37.463
A margarita.

20:39.705 --> 20:41.400
- A margarita?
- Yeah.

20:44.576 --> 20:47.272
We only have straight tequila.

20:47.746 --> 20:48.804
Just tequila.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.972
It's 2:00 in the afternoon.

20:51.149 --> 20:53.117
Welcome to El Fronteras.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.282
Mm.

22:54.406 --> 22:56.203
No, this ain't right.

22:56.675 --> 22:57.699
I don't like this.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.305
I'm getting the shotgun.

23:55.967 --> 23:57.730
Connors?

23:58.637 --> 24:00.332
Sullivan?

24:00.672 --> 24:02.264
Bill?

24:23.528 --> 24:25.962
Everybody's here.
Where's the other one?

24:26.131 --> 24:27.894
I don't know. I don't see him.

24:28.066 --> 24:30.193
<i>Check the trunk, pendejo.</i>

26:07.532 --> 26:09.363
Get out.

26:14.706 --> 26:17.436
- What are you doing?
- You're a drug dealer.

26:18.043 --> 26:20.637
- No, I'm not.
- You're a bank robber.

26:20.812 --> 26:22.279
No, I'm not.

26:22.447 --> 26:23.778
Get out of my bar.

26:23.949 --> 26:25.541
Why don't you just calm down?

26:25.717 --> 26:28.880
- Get out.
- Just let me explain. I can explain.

26:29.054 --> 26:32.023
- Where did you get all this money?
- You went through my stuff?

26:32.190 --> 26:34.420
I have a right to know
who is living in my house.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.584
You don't have a right
to go through people's stuff.

26:36.761 --> 26:38.991
Where did you get this money, huh?

26:39.831 --> 26:41.799
Hey, no, no, wait!

26:43.501 --> 26:45.025
Get out.

26:54.312 --> 26:57.042
Hey! Wait!

26:57.215 --> 26:58.842
Hey!

27:15.000 --> 27:16.695
Flaca.

27:19.904 --> 27:22.236
Oh, fuck.
- Move!

27:59.377 --> 28:01.311
Give me the bag.

29:05.577 --> 29:06.737
Flaca...

29:08.747 --> 29:11.147
<i>...is this the gabacho
who bloodied your nose?</i>

29:11.549 --> 29:12.573
Yes.

29:13.818 --> 29:14.876
Are you sure?

29:33.805 --> 29:35.932
He's too fast for you.

29:37.175 --> 29:41.168
Maybe you should try
to make love, not war.

29:46.451 --> 29:47.782
Quiet!

29:56.327 --> 29:57.351
Who are you?

29:59.364 --> 30:01.195
Nobody.

30:01.800 --> 30:02.858
Just passing through.

30:05.170 --> 30:06.865
What are you doing here?

30:08.506 --> 30:09.803
On my way to Acapulco.

30:13.778 --> 30:15.575
Acapulco?

30:17.148 --> 30:19.309
What, for spring break?

30:23.688 --> 30:25.713
Look, amigo...

30:26.524 --> 30:28.185
...I don't care where you go.

30:30.495 --> 30:33.555
Just get out of El Fronteras.

30:35.433 --> 30:38.630
- Bus doesn't leave till tomorrow.
- Ah.

30:45.343 --> 30:47.777
Make sure you're on it.

30:48.713 --> 30:49.805
Hmm?

31:27.118 --> 31:28.449
Oh, you were a big help.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.168
Get the Predator B airborne.

32:22.340 --> 32:24.672
What do you need a drone for?

32:24.842 --> 32:27.970
They sent four men on that raid.
There's only three in the car.

32:28.980 --> 32:32.814
These tracks mean
there's a car with a flat tire...

32:32.984 --> 32:35.509
...somewhere between here
and the Mexican border.

32:38.856 --> 32:40.881
And I wanna find it.

33:12.857 --> 33:15.325
Suspects heading south on 286.

33:15.493 --> 33:17.256
<i>Copy. Stop and search them.</i>

33:17.428 --> 33:20.261
- Copy that.
- Shit.

33:20.832 --> 33:23.733
Lieutenant,
they're on their way back from the buy.

33:23.901 --> 33:27.098
The only evidence they can have is money.
We can't hold them on that.

33:27.271 --> 33:29.034
<i>Wanna get Section 33'd again?</i>

33:29.207 --> 33:32.540
<i>You search those bums
and report in when you are done.</i>

33:34.112 --> 33:35.909
This is bullshit.
- Copy that.

33:36.080 --> 33:39.607
- Come on, it's called doing yourjob.
- No, it's called wasting your time.

33:39.784 --> 33:44.244
How many scumbags are we supposed to
put in jail? They'll just keep coming back.

33:52.897 --> 33:55.525
You come back to finish the job?

34:00.071 --> 34:01.129
Hmm.

34:09.447 --> 34:11.039
Must be late.

34:11.215 --> 34:13.683
I couldn't sleep.

34:14.152 --> 34:15.551
Oh, you were worried about me?

34:15.719 --> 34:18.780
I was worried about the dog.

34:20.591 --> 34:23.081
How do you like our little town?

34:27.398 --> 34:29.922
It's an acquired taste.

34:34.038 --> 34:39.567
El Fronteras was once a very nice place.

34:40.344 --> 34:43.643
The Americans used to come here
for the festivals.

34:44.181 --> 34:48.050
That's when my father built the bar.

34:52.356 --> 34:54.755
Then the violence came.

34:56.427 --> 34:59.555
The Americans left, the jobs left.

34:59.730 --> 35:03.632
The drug can'tels
needed this town empty, so...

35:05.403 --> 35:09.931
They chased everyone away.

35:11.309 --> 35:14.540
The others who stay here
are not allowed to talk to outsiders.

35:14.712 --> 35:18.580
They are paid to keep quiet.

35:20.885 --> 35:24.616
Well, that explains why
I can't get a glass of water in this town.

35:27.525 --> 35:30.187
So why'd you stay in El Fronteras?

35:33.698 --> 35:36.223
My grandmother taught me...

35:36.701 --> 35:41.832
...a person who stands up
never stands alone.

35:43.007 --> 35:44.474
You believe that?

35:45.977 --> 35:47.808
Don't you?

35:51.015 --> 35:52.846
Not anymore.

35:54.785 --> 35:56.719
One man can't make a difference, honey.

35:57.321 --> 35:59.186
Trust me.

36:06.664 --> 36:08.427
I'm sorry you feel that way.

36:16.340 --> 36:18.900
This town is not safe for you.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.775
Make sure you get on the bus tomorrow.

36:23.948 --> 36:25.540
Anna.

36:31.022 --> 36:33.013
Can't I just come back inside?

36:38.829 --> 36:41.195
Where did you get that money?

37:15.499 --> 37:17.933
Guess it's just you and me.

41:15.673 --> 41:16.901
Hola, Tortuga.

41:53.110 --> 41:54.668
Shit.

42:05.389 --> 42:07.118
Get your head in the game.

42:20.704 --> 42:22.035
Shit!

43:30.507 --> 43:31.531
Thanks a lot, kid.

43:56.667 --> 43:58.999
<i>Two-twenty-two, do you copy?</i>

43:59.169 --> 44:00.864
Lieutenant West.

44:01.038 --> 44:03.268
<i>Lieutenant,
the drone spotted your Cadillac...</i>

44:03.440 --> 44:07.035
<i>...at Mile Marker 63 on the border fence.</i>

44:07.611 --> 44:09.408
Copy that.

44:33.103 --> 44:35.230
Scourge of this town.

44:44.314 --> 44:45.338
Chief.

44:45.516 --> 44:47.848
I'll get the next one.

44:51.088 --> 44:55.684
One by one, I'm gonna clean up this town
till there's no more interference.

44:57.094 --> 45:00.928
Then I will feel
like I have done something.

45:01.098 --> 45:03.566
Chief, the gringo.

45:05.102 --> 45:07.969
He carries a black satchel full of money.

45:08.505 --> 45:11.133
- In dollars?
- Yes.

45:13.777 --> 45:16.268
The coyotes didn't come in yesterday.

45:16.447 --> 45:20.247
<i>Instead we get the pinche guerro.</i>

45:26.390 --> 45:28.381
- New plan.
Yes?

45:31.762 --> 45:35.630
Make sure he does not get the 2:00 bus.

45:44.374 --> 45:45.398
Cover the bus station.

45:45.576 --> 45:47.601
You tell the others,
and spread out from there.

45:56.653 --> 45:58.553
Shit.

46:01.125 --> 46:03.252
Let me cross the border.
That's all I wanna do.

46:03.427 --> 46:04.826
You ain't got no jurisdiction.

46:04.995 --> 46:07.429
Don't give me this
"no jurisdiction" bullshit.

46:07.598 --> 46:11.591
These motherfuckers killed
three of my men. Three.

46:16.640 --> 46:19.871
<i>Border patrol, DEA
mobile enforcement are already on this.</i>

46:20.344 --> 46:22.312
They'll find the bastards who killed them.

46:22.479 --> 46:26.108
So, what are we supposed to do
in the meantime? Sit on our ass? Is that it?

46:32.289 --> 46:36.055
<i>We are going to observe jurisdiction.</i>

46:36.460 --> 46:39.623
And you are going to follow orders.

46:52.442 --> 46:54.410
That's too easy.

46:55.179 --> 46:57.079
<i>Do we understand each other?</i>

47:08.058 --> 47:09.491
Do we?

47:22.606 --> 47:24.574
Yes, sir.

47:37.087 --> 47:39.817
How much vacation time do I have?

48:07.150 --> 48:09.983
<i>The bus leaves at 2:00 sharp.</i>

48:24.568 --> 48:26.035
<i>Agua, please?</i>

48:28.238 --> 48:29.967
Miss, come on, I'm dying of thirst here.

48:31.575 --> 48:32.633
Two hundred bucks.

48:34.011 --> 48:36.138
Two hundred bucks. Just take it.

48:36.313 --> 48:38.281
Thank you.

48:40.851 --> 48:42.148
Give me the bag.

48:47.157 --> 48:48.181
Take it easy, kid.

48:48.659 --> 48:50.320
Give me the bag.

48:50.494 --> 48:53.190
You know you're supposed
to cock it first, right?

49:03.006 --> 49:04.496
What's your name, kid?

49:04.675 --> 49:06.836
Naco.
Okay, Naco.

49:07.010 --> 49:10.810
We can both just walk away quietly...

49:10.981 --> 49:13.006
...pretend like none of this
ever happened.

49:13.517 --> 49:14.541
We got a deal, amigo?

49:24.995 --> 49:27.828
Sneaky little bastard.

52:32.916 --> 52:35.316
Armor-piercing bullets.

53:34.144 --> 53:35.577
Shit.

53:48.325 --> 53:50.259
It's 2:00.

53:50.760 --> 53:52.455
Fuck!

53:56.967 --> 53:59.595
Wait! Stop the bus! Stop the bus!

54:09.813 --> 54:11.144
Shit!

54:16.152 --> 54:17.585
What time is the next bus?

54:18.188 --> 54:19.450
No English.

54:25.061 --> 54:28.292
I said, what time is the next bus?

54:28.465 --> 54:30.126
Tomorrow, 2:00.

54:33.536 --> 54:35.163
Thank you.

55:33.930 --> 55:35.727
Find the American.

55:35.899 --> 55:37.196
Finish this.

57:05.789 --> 57:07.848
No, Flaca!

57:17.700 --> 57:18.860
Fuck.

57:21.838 --> 57:22.862
Flaca.

57:23.440 --> 57:25.408
Just listen to me.

57:25.875 --> 57:27.308
Just give me the bag.

57:29.145 --> 57:30.510
Hey, wait.

57:30.680 --> 57:32.545
They're gonna kill you for that money.

57:33.082 --> 57:35.482
Better they find it with me
than with you, right?

57:35.885 --> 57:37.648
<i>Fuck you, puta.</i>

57:45.662 --> 57:48.222
<i>We don't have time for pendejadas.</i>

58:44.354 --> 58:46.982
You said one man
can't make a difference.

58:47.524 --> 58:49.185
How about a woman?

59:21.157 --> 59:23.455
I am a police officer.

59:23.860 --> 59:25.555
A policeman.

59:28.698 --> 59:30.563
Border crossing is in Nogales.

59:31.768 --> 59:35.101
I'm with La Paz.
New Mexico Police Department.

59:35.872 --> 59:38.272
Now, if you don't open this gate...

59:38.441 --> 59:41.740
...I'm gonna report you to the DEA
and Homeland Security.

59:43.947 --> 59:46.177
Nogales is east of here.

59:46.649 --> 59:48.947
<i>You've got a long drive, migra.</i>

59:49.586 --> 59:50.678
Better get started.

59:53.890 --> 59:55.619
Let's think this through.

59:55.792 --> 59:58.260
If Homeland Security
shuts down this fence...

59:58.428 --> 01:00:02.023
...your bosses are gonna have to find
another place to conduct their affairs.

01:00:02.198 --> 01:00:05.326
Now, that is a lot of lost business
on your head.

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:07.636
So why don't you just let me through?

01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:13.941
All right, it's your funeral.

01:00:29.158 --> 01:00:32.821
Oh. Which way to El Fronteras?

01:00:40.837 --> 01:00:42.395
Don't.

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:46.670
Why you helping me?
You still think I'm a bad guy?

01:00:46.843 --> 01:00:48.470
How many men did you kill today? Hmm?

01:00:51.047 --> 01:00:53.072
I didn't really wanna kill any of them.

01:00:53.249 --> 01:00:55.410
Oh. Do you get shot every day?

01:00:55.585 --> 01:00:58.110
You have to tourniquet the wounds
to stop the bleeding.

01:00:58.287 --> 01:01:00.448
You need to tie it off with something.

01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:01.749
Hurry.

01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:23.235
Oh, yeah. Mm.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.043
It was almost won'th getting shot.

01:01:29.719 --> 01:01:31.880
Okay. Okay.

01:01:45.902 --> 01:01:48.530
Heh. Kind of wish he'd shot me
a few more times.

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:57.874
So, uh, what are you gonna use
to bandage me with?

01:01:59.782 --> 01:02:02.580
Probably your tongue.

01:02:05.888 --> 01:02:09.085
<i>I told you to stay away
from that guerro pinche, Flaca.</i>

01:02:14.497 --> 01:02:17.955
While you, you tried to kill me.

01:02:19.435 --> 01:02:21.130
That money belongs to us.

01:02:22.271 --> 01:02:25.297
<i>- Huh? You have to choose your side, mija.
I know.</i>

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:29.639
And I thought if I stole that bag,
you would jump me into the gang.

01:02:34.851 --> 01:02:38.582
The only way to join La M
is to kill a man.

01:02:47.063 --> 01:02:49.623
You got that? Huh?

01:02:51.234 --> 01:02:52.792
Now...

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:14.647
You lost this.

01:03:52.261 --> 01:03:54.821
I wish I could do something
to help you, Anna.

01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:35.651
Still, I'm concerned about your safety.

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:47.001
Did you hear about the man
who shot up a womars bar?

01:06:56.979 --> 01:06:59.345
That's where I would stay.

01:06:59.882 --> 01:07:03.079
A bunch of guys came
to a womars bar...

01:07:03.252 --> 01:07:05.413
...and they just started
shooting up the place.

01:07:05.888 --> 01:07:07.549
And why did they shoot up her place?

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:12.352
Because the town was getting
out of control.

01:07:13.929 --> 01:07:15.726
And they needed to clean things up.

01:07:23.139 --> 01:07:26.370
I hear they gave her until midnight
to leave town.

01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:30.072
And when she didn't leave...

01:07:32.815 --> 01:07:33.941
...they kill her.

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:55.394
Oh, shit.

01:07:55.871 --> 01:07:57.805
Three cops dead.

01:07:57.973 --> 01:07:59.600
Three good cops.

01:08:00.976 --> 01:08:02.307
And you take the money...

01:08:03.779 --> 01:08:06.111
...drug money, and you run?

01:08:09.618 --> 01:08:12.086
You are a disgrace.

01:08:12.688 --> 01:08:15.350
Yeah, you're right. I fucked up.

01:08:17.593 --> 01:08:21.529
But you tell me, lieutenant,
what's the point?

01:08:21.997 --> 01:08:24.795
You send us out on some bullshit job
to pick up some mutts...

01:08:24.966 --> 01:08:28.334
...who'll only bounce out on bail
or extradition. That's all we ever do.

01:08:28.504 --> 01:08:30.631
We never build a case.
We never solve anything.

01:08:30.805 --> 01:08:33.969
And the good cops die
and the bad guys get away. It's bullshit.

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:37.135
You gotta think of the big picture.
Take responsibility.

01:08:38.214 --> 01:08:42.310
You are just one man.
One man cannot change the world.

01:08:45.821 --> 01:08:47.845
So, what, are you bringing me in?

01:08:56.198 --> 01:09:00.464
I am Lieutenant West
of the New Mexico Police Department.

01:09:02.938 --> 01:09:05.236
This man is now under my supervision.

01:09:06.642 --> 01:09:08.633
What do you want with the gringo?

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:11.075
He's a wanted man in the United States.

01:09:11.546 --> 01:09:15.573
I'll be escorting him out of this town.
He is no longer your concern.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.888
What about the money?

01:09:20.956 --> 01:09:24.551
This money? Are you...?
You making a claim on this money?

01:09:24.727 --> 01:09:26.251
Yeah.

01:09:27.395 --> 01:09:29.057
This money is now state's evidence.

01:09:29.231 --> 01:09:32.564
Maybe that money belongs to us. Huh?

01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:38.372
Let me explain something to you,
Skeletor.

01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:40.406
You make a claim on this money...

01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:42.908
...I'm gonna have the DEA in here
to investigate.

01:09:43.078 --> 01:09:47.674
Something happens to me,
the DEA will be here to investigate.

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:50.375
Either way, the DEA is gonna be here...

01:09:50.553 --> 01:09:54.080
...in your small little town, to investigate.

01:09:54.256 --> 01:09:59.193
So the smart play is
lower your weapons...

01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:03.593
...allow us to pass, and salute me as I do.

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:13.099
Come on.

01:10:15.611 --> 01:10:17.272
What did he do?

01:10:17.446 --> 01:10:19.243
He stole money from a drug dealer...

01:10:19.415 --> 01:10:22.248
...and he left three of his fellow
police officers to die.

01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:32.484
Come on.

01:10:43.672 --> 01:10:46.402
You got until midnight. That's it.

01:10:46.575 --> 01:10:49.009
- They're gonna make her pay for helping me.
- Shut up.

01:10:49.178 --> 01:10:51.976
- You can't just leave her.
- Shut up. It's not my problem.

01:10:52.147 --> 01:10:53.944
Come on. Just keep moving.

01:11:02.157 --> 01:11:04.318
Is this more of your handiwork?

01:11:04.893 --> 01:11:05.951
You been a busy boy.

01:11:07.229 --> 01:11:08.753
Come on.

01:11:09.565 --> 01:11:11.465
You got ajail cell in here?

01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:21.535
Oh, we've got better than that.

01:11:37.993 --> 01:11:40.553
<i>- Here's your dinero.
- You son of a bitch.</i>

01:11:54.109 --> 01:11:56.907
Good work, lieutenant. That's for you.

01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:03.340
Now, this money was supposed to be
delivered two days ago in La Paz.

01:12:03.519 --> 01:12:05.544
Do you know where it was headed?

01:12:05.721 --> 01:12:06.881
Ah.

01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:11.156
See that it gets there.

01:12:12.394 --> 01:12:13.827
No problemo.

01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:19.467
<i>Apparently, I can trust you more
than any of these incompetent pendejos.</i>

01:12:19.635 --> 01:12:21.000
<i>Bunch of pendejos!</i>

01:12:21.737 --> 01:12:23.898
<i>You hear that? You're all pendejos.</i>

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:29.375
Yeah, you.

01:12:30.779 --> 01:12:34.875
So it was you that set us up in the desert.
Huh? That phony stop and search.

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:38.042
- You ordered those mooks to kill us.
- Yep.

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:41.254
They were good cops.

01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:44.790
This had nothing to do with them.

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:47.960
What the hell are you talking about?

01:12:48.964 --> 01:12:53.924
This was all about you.
You're too damn good at yourjob.

01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:52.189
Do you trust that cop
to deliver the money?

01:13:52.361 --> 01:13:54.158
He'll do it.

01:13:54.329 --> 01:13:56.923
He just saw what happens to cops
that steal our money.

01:13:57.099 --> 01:13:58.191
Hmm.

01:13:59.802 --> 01:14:02.362
<i>And what should we do
with the pinche gringo?</i>

01:14:02.538 --> 01:14:04.506
Kill him.

01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:09.768
Slowly.

01:15:03.765 --> 01:15:04.789
Come on.

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:07.226
Son of a...

01:15:12.407 --> 01:15:13.601
Yes.

01:15:21.884 --> 01:15:23.681
Hey, what's the problem?

01:15:24.119 --> 01:15:26.747
- I'm talking to you, asshole.
It's the fucking gringo.

01:15:38.867 --> 01:15:40.459
- He got away.
- Son of a bitch.

01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:29.776
Motherfucker.

01:16:41.863 --> 01:16:42.921
Shit.

01:16:51.707 --> 01:16:53.004
Son of a bitch.

01:17:06.989 --> 01:17:08.217
Motherfucker.

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:19.899
Come on, West.

01:17:36.885 --> 01:17:38.409
Son of a bitch.

01:17:46.728 --> 01:17:48.252
Shit!

01:17:58.173 --> 01:17:59.731
Come on!

01:18:02.844 --> 01:18:04.368
Fucking kill you, West.

01:18:11.353 --> 01:18:12.877
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:40.973
Shit. My gun.

01:18:47.856 --> 01:18:49.915
Fuck. Come on.

01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:56.197
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:19:02.604 --> 01:19:04.265
Fuck.

01:19:09.077 --> 01:19:10.271
Okay.

01:21:28.516 --> 01:21:32.043
Three good cops dead.

01:21:43.832 --> 01:21:45.663
You got me.

01:21:47.435 --> 01:21:50.268
Four cops' lives ruined.

01:21:50.872 --> 01:21:54.273
And you take the money and you run,
you son of a bitch.

01:21:55.343 --> 01:21:57.641
Seemed like a good idea at the time.

01:21:58.947 --> 01:22:00.414
Look...

01:22:04.185 --> 01:22:06.153
I'm just trying to get out of this war.

01:22:06.588 --> 01:22:08.488
Same as you.

01:22:09.357 --> 01:22:13.418
No. Same war, different sides.

01:22:13.995 --> 01:22:16.361
You think you're different from me?

01:22:17.265 --> 01:22:18.323
Not at all.

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:22.796
You betrayed your brothers
the moment you took this money.

01:22:32.514 --> 01:22:34.277
You gonna arrest me?

01:22:42.223 --> 01:22:44.157
Attaboy.

01:23:25.967 --> 01:23:26.991
No.

01:23:31.206 --> 01:23:32.298
No!

01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:38.079
You had your chance. Huh?

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:48.918
- No! No! No!
- Shh, shh.

01:23:59.667 --> 01:24:01.225
No!

01:24:01.403 --> 01:24:03.098
No!

01:24:16.618 --> 01:24:17.642
Hmm?

01:24:23.591 --> 01:24:25.183
Hmm?

01:24:44.179 --> 01:24:46.272
Anita.

01:24:46.448 --> 01:24:50.077
It didn't have to end like this, Anita.

01:24:51.453 --> 01:24:53.978
You could have just taken the money.

01:24:54.322 --> 01:24:56.256
Like all of these people.

01:25:02.130 --> 01:25:06.123
You are more stubborn
than your father was.

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:25.514
We're gonna have to kill you. Huh?

01:25:26.554 --> 01:25:28.112
You already have.

01:25:28.289 --> 01:25:30.450
Shut the fuck up. Hmm?

01:25:44.639 --> 01:25:46.300
Come on! Do it!

01:26:11.366 --> 01:26:12.663
The man is here.

01:26:13.368 --> 01:26:14.392
Where is he?

01:26:14.569 --> 01:26:16.161
There.

01:26:17.238 --> 01:26:18.262
Where the fuck is he?

01:26:29.817 --> 01:26:33.014
Shoot him. Come on. Shoot him.

01:26:36.224 --> 01:26:37.248
Come on, shoot him.

01:26:41.863 --> 01:26:43.922
Shoot him. Come on.

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:46.959
Come on, shoot him.

01:27:05.887 --> 01:27:07.752
Come on, shoot him.

01:28:02.543 --> 01:28:05.740
Fuck you and fuck La M.

01:28:10.418 --> 01:28:11.442
Thanks, kid.

01:28:30.038 --> 01:28:32.063
Come into my town.

01:28:33.675 --> 01:28:35.370
Steal my money.

01:28:37.345 --> 01:28:39.370
Kill my men.

01:29:03.037 --> 01:29:05.597
Scourge of this town.

01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:29.758
This is a heroin highway.

01:29:33.067 --> 01:29:35.092
You're just a man.

01:29:39.173 --> 01:29:42.165
There's nothing you can do to stop this.

01:29:42.343 --> 01:29:44.311
You can kill everyone in El Fronteras...

01:29:44.479 --> 01:29:48.609
...but you can't kill every gangster
in Mexico.

01:29:48.783 --> 01:29:51.251
We'll just keep coming
and coming and coming.

01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:56.747
Shut the hell up.

01:29:57.358 --> 01:29:58.620
Nobody's listening.

01:30:15.109 --> 01:30:16.736
Anna.

01:30:39.033 --> 01:30:41.160
Shit.

01:30:42.437 --> 01:30:44.029
Nice.

01:31:38.192 --> 01:31:40.387
Your father would be very proud of you.

01:31:59.881 --> 01:32:01.781
I'm sorry about the bar, Anna.

01:32:05.219 --> 01:32:07.119
It's okay.

01:32:09.891 --> 01:32:11.859
I'll build a new one.

01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:21.497
So, uh...

01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:23.830
...this is a lot of money.

01:32:24.605 --> 01:32:26.197
What will you do with it?

01:32:27.675 --> 01:32:30.906
I was thinking about buying
a really big glass of water.

01:32:46.894 --> 01:32:49.089
You can keep the change.

01:33:08.616 --> 01:33:11.016
- There you go, ladies.
Thank you.

01:33:34.642 --> 01:33:37.202
How about a margarita on the house?

01:33:38.913 --> 01:33:41.211
I didn't think they served margaritas
around here.

01:33:44.385 --> 01:33:46.649
Can we get another round
over here, please?

01:33:46.821 --> 01:33:48.721
Of course. I'll be right there.

01:33:48.889 --> 01:33:50.379
The tourists request them.

01:33:53.861 --> 01:33:56.523
A margarita sounds pretty good
right about now.

01:33:57.431 --> 01:33:59.228
What happened to Acapulco?

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:03.170
- Acapulco?
Mm-hm.

01:34:03.337 --> 01:34:04.861
- That's a tourist trap.
- Mm.

01:34:05.039 --> 01:34:08.566
You wanna go to a nice place,
you go to El Fronteras.

01:34:10.511 --> 01:34:12.411
So...

01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:24.217
...tell me...

01:34:27.228 --> 01:34:30.561
...what's your name, by the way?

01:34:34.368 --> 01:34:37.599
Well, my name is...

01:34:38.305 --> 01:34:44.709
