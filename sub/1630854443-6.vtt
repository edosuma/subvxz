[birds chirping]

00:31.573 --> 00:34.492
[water splashing]

00:39.330 --> 00:40.749
- That was a first for me.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.418
- Same here.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.170
- Seriously?

00:45.211 --> 00:46.755
- Never got around to it before.

00:47.464 --> 00:50.175
- I find that
hard to believe.

00:50.216 --> 00:51.593
- I'm frankly
surprised myself.

00:54.471 --> 00:55.597
You know what today is?

00:58.475 --> 00:59.351
- It's Wednesday?

01:00.602 --> 01:01.770
- It's bed day.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.191
- As in:
we stay in bed all day?

01:06.232 --> 01:08.193
- Mm- hm.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.486
- What will we eat?

01:11.488 --> 01:12.614
- Carnivorous flowers.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.743
- With blackberry jam?

01:16.785 --> 01:19.329
- Where are we
going to find jam?

01:19.371 --> 01:21.122
- I have some in my bag.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.376
[camera shutter clicks]

01:26.503 --> 01:27.587
Alba (voice-over): As we
continued down the road,

01:27.629 --> 01:29.506
our brambles
drew back their thorns,

01:30.799 --> 01:32.801
like cats
retracting their claws.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.638
Leopards revealing
their true spots.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.607
- I don't want you
to get mad at me.

01:47.649 --> 01:48.650
- Okay.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.778
- When someone
always tells you what to do,

01:51.820 --> 01:53.780
at a certain point your brain
welcomes it.

01:53.822 --> 01:57.909
Your brain craves,
or at least my brain craves...

01:57.951 --> 01:59.494
This is really stupid.
I don't know what I'm saying.

01:59.536 --> 02:01.413
It's like I'm trying to
regain my motor skills.

02:02.539 --> 02:03.540
I...

02:04.958 --> 02:06.668
I don't know
what you want from me.

02:08.545 --> 02:09.838
- I want your secrets.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.298
- You want my secrets?

02:13.425 --> 02:15.260
- Anything
you want to tell me.

02:15.301 --> 02:17.512
Anything you think
you can't tell anyone else.

02:17.554 --> 02:18.430
- Why?

02:19.973 --> 02:22.267
- I want to keep them safe.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.269
- My embarrassing
confessions.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.812
- Everything.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.397
- Guilt.

02:27.439 --> 02:30.650
- Shame, lust,

02:30.692 --> 02:32.944
anything you think is despicable
and makes you horrible.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.320
I want them.

02:35.572 --> 02:36.948
- You are sick.

02:36.990 --> 02:40.410
- [Soft chuckle]
Everybody's sick.

02:40.452 --> 02:42.829
[kissing]

02:42.871 --> 02:44.456
Nobody's sick.

02:57.469 --> 02:59.429
- Marriage brings out
the worst in people.

02:59.471 --> 03:01.556
[Birds chirping]

03:01.598 --> 03:05.560
At first, Archie's bottomless
confidence, his smarmy charm,

03:05.602 --> 03:07.562
his every
self- aggrandizing gesture

03:07.604 --> 03:09.356
all seemed to be
able to paper over

03:09.397 --> 03:10.440
any cracks
in our relationship.

03:10.482 --> 03:15.445
But, one day I...

03:15.487 --> 03:17.614
I turned over in bed
and I looked at him.

03:19.908 --> 03:23.328
I mean, I really looked at him
for what he was,

03:23.370 --> 03:27.749
and right then,
I fell out of love.

03:29.501 --> 03:32.003
I understood in my bones
that he was a powerful being

03:32.045 --> 03:34.589
and that he expected
I should answer to him

03:34.631 --> 03:37.884
according to his will,
and I realized what he wanted.

03:37.926 --> 03:42.722
He wanted to get inside my head
and infiltrate my consciousness.

03:42.764 --> 03:46.768
So I swore to myself
I wouldn't sleep.

03:48.645 --> 03:54.609
How many days and nights
was I awake,

03:54.651 --> 03:58.947
I'm not entirely sure,
but it went into several weeks.

04:01.950 --> 04:05.286
This proved
not to be a good idea.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.625
One morning, or night,
it's not entirely clear,

04:10.667 --> 04:12.502
I woke up inside
an enclosed space,

04:12.544 --> 04:15.046
what I thought was a casket.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.631
It was dark
and musty and small.

04:16.673 --> 04:20.510
And I thought,
"Okay, I'm dreaming,

04:20.552 --> 04:22.637
this is a dream
of being claustrophobic

04:22.679 --> 04:24.764
because I suffer from that
in real life."

04:24.806 --> 04:27.058
An agoraphobic reaction
in diving,

04:27.100 --> 04:30.061
often called Blue Orb
or Blue Dome syndrome,

04:30.103 --> 04:31.771
is what a phobic diver
can experience

04:31.813 --> 04:34.399
when she loses contact with
both the bottom and the surface

04:34.441 --> 04:37.068
and becomes
spatially disoriented.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.946
And this is
what this felt like,

04:39.988 --> 04:41.698
like I was floating in space.

04:44.576 --> 04:47.078
I panicked and I started banging
on the door in front of me,

04:47.120 --> 04:49.956
because that's what it was,
a door.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.709
And I banged it so hard that
I realized there was no way

04:52.751 --> 04:54.961
that I was dreaming
unless I was in the most

04:55.003 --> 04:57.088
realistic nightmare within
a nightmare ever

04:57.130 --> 04:59.549
and that's when it hit me:

04:59.591 --> 05:01.468
I was inside my own closet.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.430
I could feel my clothes
on the rack behind me

05:05.472 --> 05:07.098
and my shoes on the cold floor

05:07.140 --> 05:11.978
and I could see the keyhole
where the key had locked me in.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.105
Where he had locked me in.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.023
- What's this?

05:17.025 --> 05:18.026
Batty: I don't know.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.615
Alba: Make sure to sand it
down, it looks dreadful.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.701
- In a blur,
I could remember

05:26.743 --> 05:32.123
flashes of an argument
and Archie wasted, high,

05:32.165 --> 05:35.835
drunk, horny, violent,
had dragged me by the hair

05:35.877 --> 05:37.629
into the closet
because he knew.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.385
He knew that was
my biggest fear.

05:45.512 --> 05:50.016
It is... it is a terrible moment

05:50.058 --> 05:51.893
when you realize
you're the weaker one.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.897
And this moment was the most
terrible moment of my life.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.152
When divers panic,
they react quickly

06:01.194 --> 06:04.030
but irrationally.
Their attention narrows

06:04.072 --> 06:06.616
and they lose the ability
to sort out options.

06:06.658 --> 06:08.493
If, for example,
a problem develops

06:08.535 --> 06:10.745
with the regulator,
the restricted airflow

06:10.787 --> 06:12.872
can prompt a panicked diver
to ascend rapidly enough

06:12.914 --> 06:15.166
to cause an often- fatal
arterial gas embolism

06:15.208 --> 06:16.751
in the bloodstream.

06:16.793 --> 06:17.836
A bubble.

06:19.921 --> 06:22.757
And that's what happened to me.

06:22.799 --> 06:25.510
A bubble grew inside my chest.

06:25.552 --> 06:28.179
It kept expanding while I
kept pounding on the door,

06:28.221 --> 06:30.056
breaking my fingernails,

06:30.098 --> 06:33.184
scratching the wood
like a possessed cat.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.186
And when I finally
broke the door,

06:35.228 --> 06:37.897
I went downstairs and I found
him passed out by the pool.

06:37.939 --> 06:38.815
[Sniffling]

06:41.234 --> 06:42.777
There are those moments
when you're capable of

06:42.819 --> 06:46.114
forgiving everything,
but this was not one of them.

06:48.825 --> 06:51.077
I promised myself I would go on
letting him think

06:51.119 --> 06:53.955
he was in charge
until the day I would kill him.

06:58.251 --> 07:01.129
[Melancholic music]

07:10.722 --> 07:12.223
[Sniffles]

07:12.265 --> 07:15.560
I don't have a good track record
keeping my promises.

07:15.602 --> 07:18.980
But there's an exception
to every rule.

07:35.622 --> 07:36.873
[Moans]

07:48.760 --> 07:51.596
[Footsteps]

07:51.638 --> 07:52.514
[Batty sniffling]

07:57.310 --> 07:59.729
[Crying]

07:59.771 --> 08:00.897
- What are you doing up?

08:02.190 --> 08:04.192
- I couldn't sleep.
Go back to bed. [Sniffles]

08:05.777 --> 08:07.195
- Why are you crying?

08:09.322 --> 08:10.782
[Sighs]

08:12.909 --> 08:15.036
I'm afraid
that I'm capable of

08:16.913 --> 08:19.165
some kind of
invincible passion

08:19.207 --> 08:21.543
that drags everyone I love
to their doom.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.212
[Alba chuckles softly]

08:25.672 --> 08:27.882
- Is that amusing?

08:27.924 --> 08:31.219
- No.
No, no.

08:32.679 --> 08:36.016
It's just, uh,

08:36.057 --> 08:38.226
that's my entire history
up to tonight.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.023
Come to bed.

08:43.064 --> 08:44.065
- Mm.

08:46.067 --> 08:46.943
You go.

08:53.825 --> 08:56.077
[Birds chirping]

08:57.245 --> 08:59.831
[Scrubbing]

09:03.835 --> 09:05.670
- Good morning.

09:05.712 --> 09:06.713
- Good morning.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.216
- You got up early.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.344
- It's not that early.
You slept all day.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.220
- I did?

09:14.262 --> 09:17.057
I guess I was tired.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.725
I wonder why
I'm sore everywhere.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.813
You don't have to
do that anymore.

09:23.855 --> 09:24.981
- It keeps me sane.

09:26.733 --> 09:30.236
- What happened?
Did I do something wrong?

09:30.278 --> 09:31.988
- I'm the worst person
to ask.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.118
- Maybe I'll swim for a bit.

09:49.964 --> 09:52.050
Batty ; [voice-over] At first,
I fought against all of it.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.177
My whole miserable existence.

09:54.219 --> 09:57.806
I plotted my escape,
I plotted a second murder,

09:57.847 --> 10:00.183
I plotted my suicide.

10:00.225 --> 10:03.061
But then the most remarkable
thing happened.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.063
My brain went quiet.

10:05.105 --> 10:09.067
I mean, perfectly silent,
like someone shut it off.

10:09.109 --> 10:12.070
Alba controlled what I ate,
when I slept,

10:12.112 --> 10:14.364
showered, what I read.

10:14.406 --> 10:17.742
My entire day mapped out
and perfectly executed.

10:19.244 --> 10:22.831
She tried so hard to be strict,
to teach me discipline,

10:22.872 --> 10:24.374
to punish me.

10:24.416 --> 10:28.211
But much as I wish they could,

10:28.253 --> 10:31.214
none of her punishments
fit my crime.

10:31.256 --> 10:34.509
My previous life
felt suddenly inadequate.

10:34.551 --> 10:37.095
I stopped having nightmares
about Archie.

10:37.137 --> 10:41.099
I was cured of my narcolepsy.
Loneliness vanished.

10:41.141 --> 10:44.519
None of my insecurities
had any room to breathe.

10:44.561 --> 10:47.522
I no longer wondered if
I was doing the right thing,

10:47.564 --> 10:51.234
I only wondered
how to best please Alba.

10:51.276 --> 10:53.403
I was in a state of confusion.

10:53.445 --> 10:56.239
What had I done
to deserve this woman.

10:56.281 --> 10:58.867
I turned to the world's
most famous self- help book

10:58.908 --> 11:01.453
to give me ideas, but even that
she cut right through.

11:03.455 --> 11:05.999
Love is rare
because it rarely happens,

11:06.041 --> 11:07.876
as somebody wise once said.

11:07.917 --> 11:12.005
But here I was
overcome by feelings

11:12.047 --> 11:15.133
I have no right to feel.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.052
The heart wants
what the heart wants.

11:19.179 --> 11:23.183
And not just the heart,
every part of me.

11:25.602 --> 11:28.146
But there comes a time
where we must all face facts.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.564
And the fact is

11:29.606 --> 11:31.316
I can't make her
complicit in my crime.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.194
So I must lie
and break her heart.

11:36.321 --> 11:37.322
Alba,

11:42.202 --> 11:44.954
you asked to know my secrets so
I will share them with you.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.042
Everything I said to you,

11:49.084 --> 11:51.836
everything we did
together in bed is a lie.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.927
I am a murderess, yes.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.596
But you are
twisted and depraved.

12:01.638 --> 12:04.933
A witch who has bewitched me.
For this I despise you.

[Clanks]

13:34.189 --> 13:35.273
- Can we talk?

13:35.315 --> 13:38.193
- After dinner.
Guests are coming.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.235
- Cancel it.

13:39.277 --> 13:41.154
- Can't.
Phone lines are down again.

13:41.196 --> 13:43.198

by tomorrow.

14:19.109 --> 14:20.360
Alba?
Is that your name?

14:20.402 --> 14:21.444
Alba: Yes.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.071
- We're not here to hurt you,

14:23.113 --> 14:24.364
we just need a place
to lay low for a little while.

14:24.406 --> 14:25.490
Who else is in the house?

14:27.534 --> 14:28.993
What is there to think about?

14:42.007 --> 14:43.758
Malone: Still down
Mexico way, your Honor.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.468
- What number
are you calling me from?

14:45.510 --> 14:47.345
Malone: A friend. It's safe.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.764
What about your line? Any chance
anybody's listening in?

14:49.806 --> 14:52.225
- No.
What the hell happened?

14:52.267 --> 14:54.102
Malone: They knew
we were coming.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.228
- What?
- The cops.

14:55.270 --> 14:56.771
They knew we were coming.

14:56.813 --> 14:59.399
The job went down like clockwork
but we were ambushed.

14:59.441 --> 15:00.775

- I...
Back up for a second,

15:03.278 --> 15:05.822
you're not making sense.
Do you have the diamonds?

26:28.963 --> 26:30.590
- Why?

26:30.632 --> 26:33.468
- Because
I'm sleeping with Fausto.

26:33.510 --> 26:35.595
[scoffs] - Bullshit.

26:35.637 --> 26:36.846
- I'm sorry.

26:39.099 --> 26:40.475
- Wait, you're sleeping
with Alba's butler?

26:40.517 --> 26:42.602
You guys met last night
and fell madly in love?

26:42.644 --> 26:44.938
- I didn't say love, but...

26:44.979 --> 26:46.022
- It's early.

26:48.983 --> 26:50.944
- Fausto and I met before

26:50.985 --> 26:52.612
when he was a customer
at the casino

26:52.654 --> 26:54.948
and we really liked each other,

26:54.989 --> 26:56.533
but he had a girlfriend
at the time.

26:56.574 --> 27:01.204
And so when we came for dinner
and he was here, I just thought

27:01.246 --> 27:03.081
it must mean something,
you know?

27:03.123 --> 27:05.083
- Mean what?

27:05.125 --> 27:09.087
- Fate. This is my fate
and I can't escape it.

27:09.129 --> 27:10.630
- You didn't know
he was working for Alba?

27:10.672 --> 27:11.965
- How could I possibly know?

27:12.007 --> 27:14.509
- I assure you
she didn't know.

27:14.551 --> 27:17.512
- One thing led to another.

27:17.554 --> 27:19.222
Why do you think
I kept getting up

27:19.264 --> 27:20.974
and going to the kitchen?

27:21.016 --> 27:21.975
- You were in the kitchen?

27:22.017 --> 27:23.226
I thought you went
to the bathroom?

27:23.268 --> 27:24.269
- No, the kitchen.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.395
What do you think
I was doing there?

27:25.437 --> 27:27.522
- I don't know, what?

27:27.564 --> 27:29.649
- Use your imagination.

27:29.691 --> 27:31.026
[phone vibrating]
[Max grunts]

27:34.154 --> 27:36.656
Hey, Roberto.
Uh, I'm in a meeting.

27:36.698 --> 27:38.700
Yeah.
Let me call you back.

27:38.742 --> 27:40.285
All right.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.120
- Hey, you get reception here?
Can I borrow that?

27:42.162 --> 27:43.246
- Go fuck yourself.

27:43.288 --> 27:44.414
What happened in the kitchen?

27:44.456 --> 27:46.416
- Like they say.
Once you go...

27:46.458 --> 27:48.001
- Don't be predictable.

27:48.043 --> 27:49.294
Let me borrow your phone a sec.

27:49.336 --> 27:51.379
Just while you two
sort this out.

27:51.421 --> 27:53.256
- What did you do to her
in the kitchen?

27:53.298 --> 27:55.008
- Have a little dignity.

27:55.050 --> 27:56.384
- One sec.

27:56.426 --> 27:58.553
You're a servant, right?

27:58.595 --> 28:00.680
So you're gonna teach me,
what, exactly?

28:00.722 --> 28:03.558
- We servants
have a shit ton of dignity.

28:03.600 --> 28:06.019
And let me borrow your phone
before I take it from you.

28:06.061 --> 28:07.187
[scoffs] -  Are you
threatening me?

28:07.228 --> 28:08.271
- Don't make waves.

28:08.313 --> 28:09.731
- What is your problem, asshole?

28:09.773 --> 28:11.274
- Max, don't.

28:11.316 --> 28:14.694
- You know, you should have seen
how vital and free she was,

28:14.736 --> 28:16.446
bent over that kitchen counter.
Mm.

28:17.614 --> 28:18.698
I honestly don't think
you've been

28:18.740 --> 28:20.158
getting the most out of her.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.577
- Shit! Oh!
- No, no, no!

28:22.619 --> 28:23.578
Stop! Wait, wait, wait!

28:23.620 --> 28:25.705
Stop, stop, stop!

28:25.747 --> 28:26.706
You're gonna break his ribs!

28:26.748 --> 28:28.583
- That's the general idea.

28:28.625 --> 28:30.460
[Grunting]

28:32.379 --> 28:35.340
[***]

29:47.412 --> 29:50.290
[***]
