00:12.357 --> 00:14.600
Has there been
any word on an American woman,

00:14.704 --> 00:15.601
Deborah Fletcher?

00:18.673 --> 00:21.021
- As-Salaam-Alaikum.
I'm alive!

00:23.299 --> 00:25.301
- Al-Owhali.
He needs to leave Kenya.

00:25.335 --> 00:27.786
When people use my religion

00:27.889 --> 00:30.064
to justify this shit,
it affects me.

00:30.133 --> 00:31.790
Don't tell me.

00:31.893 --> 00:34.275
You have to leave.
- I'm sorry.

00:34.344 --> 00:36.933
- I know your feelings
about church are complicated.

00:37.002 --> 00:39.280
Would you ever consider
taking communion again?

00:41.179 --> 00:43.940
It's about future intention,
not past sin.

00:44.009 --> 00:47.461
- Write down the number you
called after the bomb went off!

00:47.530 --> 00:49.463
Write down the number!

00:49.532 --> 00:51.465
Number he called
after the bombing.

00:51.534 --> 00:53.329
- This motherfucker Bin Laden
isn't kidding around.

00:53.432 --> 00:54.916
- That's why we have to act now.

00:54.985 --> 00:56.780
- Let's do it.

00:56.849 --> 00:58.437
- You got talked into bullshit
by Tenet and Schmidt

00:58.506 --> 00:59.818
who don't give a shit
about my people

00:59.921 --> 01:01.095
and what we're doing over there.

01:01.164 --> 01:02.165
- It was the president's call.

01:02.269 --> 01:03.856
- Bin Laden's laid a trap,

01:03.960 --> 01:05.444
and we're walking right in
and nibbling the cheese.

01:05.513 --> 01:07.584
He wants to go to war.

02:05.677 --> 02:08.300
President Omar al-Bashir
lashed out at the U.S.,

02:08.369 --> 02:10.301
describing last week's
missile attack

02:10.371 --> 02:13.063
on a Khartoum factory
as an ugly crime.

02:13.167 --> 02:15.721
Al-Bashir said
U.S. President Bill Clinton

02:15.790 --> 02:17.999
was a war criminal
of the first degree

02:18.068 --> 02:20.312
and blamed
American intelligence services

02:20.381 --> 02:23.108
for supplying him
with false information.

02:23.212 --> 02:26.525
He reasserted Sudan's claim
that the destroyed factory

02:26.594 --> 02:29.770
was involved solely in
the manufacture of medicines.

02:29.873 --> 02:33.222
Anti-U.S. protests continue
on the streets of Khartoum.

02:33.291 --> 02:35.914
In Cairo, the Arab League
unanimously condemned

02:36.017 --> 02:37.743
the U.S. strike on Khartoum,

02:37.812 --> 02:39.918
describing it
as a flagrant violation

02:40.021 --> 02:41.540
of international law.

02:41.609 --> 02:42.783
This was
a pharmaceutical…

02:42.886 --> 02:44.060
Ah.

02:46.096 --> 02:48.444
For the treatment of
humans and veterinary medicines

02:48.547 --> 02:50.100
for the treatment of animals,

02:50.204 --> 02:53.103
and certainly it was not
at any stage being used

02:53.207 --> 02:55.761
for the production
of any agent they say

02:55.830 --> 02:58.350
used in the manufacture
of chemical weapons.

02:58.419 --> 03:01.111
The Sudanese government has
asked for an inspection team,

03:01.215 --> 03:04.701
and it is now waiting to see
that it gets one.

03:10.776 --> 03:13.607
- You've been flagged
for recent expense patterns.

03:13.676 --> 03:15.988
Last week alone you submitted
three separate receipts

03:16.092 --> 03:17.921
from Elaine's…

03:17.990 --> 03:19.268
the sum of which nearly exceeded

03:19.337 --> 03:21.960
your monthly allotment.

03:22.063 --> 03:23.341
- Look, it's not like
I'm running

03:23.444 --> 03:25.170
party buses heading to Foxwoods.

03:25.274 --> 03:27.241
I'm having dinner and drinks
with important people.

03:27.310 --> 03:30.279
- But the Bureau simply can't
cover what you're spending.

03:30.382 --> 03:32.039
Also, you happen to be
in serious debt.

03:32.142 --> 03:34.593
- Are you going through
my fuckin' credit cards?

03:34.662 --> 03:36.285
Huh?

03:36.388 --> 03:37.734
How long you been
with the Bureau?

03:37.803 --> 03:39.149
- Six months.

03:39.253 --> 03:41.428
- What are you, 22, 23?
- 26.

03:41.497 --> 03:43.844
- Where you from?
- Overland Park, Kansas.

03:43.947 --> 03:45.949
- What's your first name,
Nemtusiak?

03:46.018 --> 03:47.744
- Jim.

03:47.813 --> 03:50.126
- You saw the footage
of the Embassy bombings, Jim?

03:50.230 --> 03:52.301
The body parts? The rubble?

03:52.370 --> 03:55.269
The blind office workers,
glass blown into their brains?

03:55.338 --> 03:57.582
- It was awful.
- Jim, part of my job

03:57.651 --> 03:59.687
is to host law enforcement
agents from abroad

03:59.791 --> 04:01.586
so that when
we're on their turf,

04:01.655 --> 04:04.623
whether its Nairobi, Tanzania,
London, what have you,

04:04.692 --> 04:06.384
they treat us right.

04:06.487 --> 04:09.007
This is a small
but very, very important part

04:09.110 --> 04:10.526
of what I do.

04:10.629 --> 04:14.978
- Sir, I totally understand
that, um…

04:15.047 --> 04:18.016
entertaining…
- Hosting.

04:18.084 --> 04:21.813
- I understand
that hosting might be

04:21.882 --> 04:24.850
a part of your job,
but with all due respect,

04:24.919 --> 04:28.233
you need to start living
within your means.

04:28.337 --> 04:30.200
As a veteran special agent,
you're no doubt well aware

04:30.304 --> 04:32.030
that unresolvable debt
makes you a target

04:32.133 --> 04:33.618
for enemy intelligence.

04:44.214 --> 04:47.148
You need to get on top of it.

05:16.695 --> 05:18.248
During the interrogation

05:18.352 --> 05:20.250
of the Nairobi embassy bomber,

05:20.354 --> 05:23.461
FBI Agent Robert Chesney
was able to obtain

05:23.564 --> 05:26.256
the first number he called
after the explosion.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.707
We passed that phone number
to the CIA.

05:28.776 --> 05:31.261
It was the home
of Ahmed al-Hada.

05:31.365 --> 05:32.918
Despite sharing our evidence

05:32.987 --> 05:34.920
about the Hada phone
with the CIA,

05:34.989 --> 05:37.509
they never returned the favor.

05:37.578 --> 05:40.616
From then on,
the FBI had an impossible time

05:40.719 --> 05:43.273
getting intelligence back
about that phone.

05:43.377 --> 05:44.274
- Yeah?

05:44.378 --> 05:45.724
- Hada's phone is tapped.

05:45.793 --> 05:48.762
- Proceed F.O.V.
- Copy that.

05:51.005 --> 05:53.249
Alec Station
was holding back information,

05:53.353 --> 05:56.597
and it was becoming
an unfortunate pattern.

07:01.973 --> 07:04.389
Demonstrators in
Islamabad burned an effigy

07:04.493 --> 07:07.530
of Clinton in condemnation
of the U.S. missile attacks

07:07.634 --> 07:10.119
in nearby Khost, Afghanistan.

07:10.188 --> 07:12.190
Amid widespread protests,

07:12.259 --> 07:14.917
the United States bolstered
security at facilities

07:15.020 --> 07:17.091
in all countries
where there are likely

07:17.195 --> 07:19.335
to be sympathizers of Bin Laden.

07:19.404 --> 07:22.994
As anti-American feelings
escalated across the world…

07:28.655 --> 07:31.485
Al-Qaeda isn't
a normal enemy force.

07:31.554 --> 07:33.763
You can't just cut
the head off the snake.

07:33.867 --> 07:35.627
It's more pervasive.

07:35.696 --> 07:38.181
It's like the "mercury" theme
in "Terminator II."

07:38.250 --> 07:39.666
- Never saw it.

07:39.735 --> 07:41.840
- In the movie, the enemy,
the T-1000,

07:41.909 --> 07:44.602
which is an android assassin
played by Robert Patrick,

07:44.705 --> 07:46.742
has harnessed the properties
of liquid metal,

07:46.845 --> 07:49.607
which quickly disperses
and reconstitutes.

07:49.710 --> 07:53.231
Therefore, he is virtually
impossible to defeat.

07:53.334 --> 07:55.267
Bin Laden is espousing
an ideology

07:55.371 --> 07:57.649
that exists
at the cellular level.

07:57.718 --> 08:01.239
Cancer by its most basic
definition is the multiplicity

08:01.342 --> 08:03.379
of cells,
and al-Qaeda is a cancer.

08:03.448 --> 08:05.243
- You're starting to mix
your metaphors.

08:05.312 --> 08:07.210
- My point is that al-Qaeda
is not gonna be defeated

08:07.279 --> 08:09.385
by simply gunning down the boss.

08:09.454 --> 08:13.423
To them, martyrdom
is the purest kind of poetry.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.425
It's beyond poetry.

08:15.529 --> 08:17.048
It's eternity.

08:17.117 --> 08:18.877
Each time we snuff
a part of it out,

08:18.946 --> 08:20.500
it will keep resurfacing.

08:20.569 --> 08:22.640
It goes that deep.

08:22.743 --> 08:25.090
Killing Bin Laden is only
going to secure his legend

08:25.159 --> 08:27.230
and inspire
more and more martyrs.

08:29.543 --> 08:31.890
- So I got a question.

08:31.959 --> 08:33.650
These so-called martyrs.

08:33.754 --> 08:35.273
They blow themselves
to smithereens

08:35.376 --> 08:37.655
in front of our embassies.

08:37.758 --> 08:39.657
Is this "72 virgins" thing

08:39.760 --> 08:42.900
really what they're expecting
on the other side?

08:42.970 --> 08:44.869
- Not merely 72 virgins, boss.

08:44.938 --> 08:46.905
72 blonde and redheaded virgins

08:46.974 --> 08:49.287
with beautiful breasts
and mesmerizing eyes.

08:49.390 --> 08:51.461
- Like Swedish girls?

08:51.565 --> 08:55.327
- Swedish, German,
Irish, Russian.

08:55.431 --> 08:58.468
- So basically this is all
about international pussy.

08:58.572 --> 09:00.436
Who came up with this horseshit?

09:00.540 --> 09:01.748
- It's not from the Koran.

09:01.817 --> 09:03.681
Basically, it's urban legend.

09:03.784 --> 09:04.958
- What do you make of it?

09:05.061 --> 09:06.476
- I think it's preposterous

09:06.580 --> 09:08.375
and far from the heart of Islam.

09:08.478 --> 09:10.688
- "Blow yourself up
and win the pussy" sweepstakes

09:10.791 --> 09:12.931
is like consumer fraud

09:13.000 --> 09:15.347
and, ironically,
so fucking American.

09:15.451 --> 09:19.006
- Yeah, but it does wonders
for al-Qaeda recruitment.

09:19.110 --> 09:20.939
- Your check, gentlemen.

09:21.008 --> 09:22.492
- Bartender put these beers
on here?

09:22.596 --> 09:24.322
- He did. Take your time.

09:24.425 --> 09:25.703
- Got it.
- No, no, put…

09:25.806 --> 09:27.532
- Boss, seriously…
- Put… hey, hey.

09:27.636 --> 09:29.499
Put your fucking money away,
or I'll tear it up.

09:29.603 --> 09:32.330
Here. Save it
for a new pair of shoes.

09:32.433 --> 09:35.298
- Why?
- Seriously?

09:35.367 --> 09:37.162
- Are they that bad?

09:37.231 --> 09:39.371
- What are those,
friggin' cross-trainers?

09:39.475 --> 09:41.960
You look like you ump
little league or something.

09:42.029 --> 09:43.548
We gotta set you up
with a good pair.

09:43.652 --> 09:45.515
I know a guy.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.103
- What do you wear?

09:47.172 --> 09:49.174
- These are Bruno Magli.

09:49.243 --> 09:52.971
They judge you by your shoes
quicker than anything else.

09:53.040 --> 09:55.733
You should start out
with a pair of Harrises.

09:55.836 --> 09:58.183
Ferragamo makes
a nice loafer too.

09:58.252 --> 10:00.358
- Sir, your card
has been declined.

10:00.461 --> 10:03.361
- Really?
- I'm afraid so.

10:03.464 --> 10:05.501
- That's all right, I got it.

10:17.858 --> 10:20.205
So what you're
proposing is that we bomb

10:20.274 --> 10:23.243
a bird hunting expedition
in Afghanistan.

10:23.346 --> 10:25.555
- In the desert, approximately
12 miles south of Kandahar.

10:25.659 --> 10:28.835
- And this party will consist
of UAE princes,

10:28.904 --> 10:30.733
unknown members of the Taliban…

10:30.837 --> 10:32.908
- And possibly Bin Laden.

10:33.011 --> 10:35.013
According to our source,
the princes will be arriving

10:35.082 --> 10:37.429
in a C-130
with numerous supplies

10:37.533 --> 10:41.088
and approximately a dozen
4x4 pickups.

10:41.192 --> 10:42.780
- And what are the pickups
there for, exactly?

10:42.883 --> 10:44.195
- They're being left
as gratuities

10:44.264 --> 10:46.093
for their Taliban hosts.

10:47.888 --> 10:50.235
As soon as Bin Laden sets foot
in that camp,

10:50.304 --> 10:52.030
my source will report
to our handler in Pakistan.

10:52.099 --> 10:53.929
I'll have the intel on my desk
within an hour.

10:54.032 --> 10:56.103
- You realize
there will be allies present

10:56.207 --> 10:58.416
at this bird hunt.
- They may be our allies,

10:58.519 --> 10:59.589
but they're cavorting
with the enemy.

10:59.693 --> 11:01.177
- Martin, we're already dealing

11:01.246 --> 11:03.248
with considerable blowback
from Khost.

11:03.317 --> 11:05.423
We don't need
any more questionable targets

11:05.492 --> 11:07.632
that haven't been thoroughly
thought through.

11:07.736 --> 11:09.807
- Sir,
even if a few princes die,

11:09.910 --> 11:11.429
we can get Bin Laden.

11:11.532 --> 11:13.396
- I'm sorry,
but can I say something?

11:13.465 --> 11:16.468
- Please.
- If we do this,

11:16.572 --> 11:19.264
we might as well send al-Qaeda
bronze Bin Laden statues

11:19.333 --> 11:21.266
to erect in front
of all their training camps.

11:21.335 --> 11:24.062
Within days, there will be
a million more recruits

11:24.131 --> 11:25.650
ready to sign up.

11:25.754 --> 11:27.238
Do you even understand
the concept of martyrdom?

11:27.307 --> 11:29.412
- Of course. I do.

11:29.481 --> 11:30.828
- This isn't a war
about one man.

11:30.931 --> 11:32.864
Bin Laden is an ideologue,

11:32.933 --> 11:35.073
not some plutocrat
running a banana republic.

11:35.142 --> 11:38.456
His people actually believe.

11:38.559 --> 11:40.458
It's Bin Laden-ism
we're up against,

11:40.561 --> 11:42.632
not just Bin Laden.

11:44.773 --> 11:47.292
- Martin, I have to say that
I agree with John on this one.

11:47.361 --> 11:49.294
- You are making a mistake, sir.

11:49.363 --> 11:51.883
- You can't even guarantee
that Bin Laden will be there.

11:51.952 --> 11:53.920
There's simply too much risk.

11:56.370 --> 11:58.096
- Someday this administration
will be remembered

11:58.165 --> 12:00.167
for the risks it didn't take

12:00.271 --> 12:03.653
and the nerve it didn't have.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.586
What are we gonna say
to the American widows

12:05.655 --> 12:07.105
who want to know
what could have been done

12:07.174 --> 12:09.107
to protect their husbands?

12:09.176 --> 12:11.109
- Does your unit at Alec Station

12:11.178 --> 12:14.561
have any other intel
that I-49 should know about?

12:14.664 --> 12:16.666
Anything from that phone number
we gave you?

12:16.770 --> 12:19.497
- You're getting everything
we're getting.

12:40.069 --> 12:42.934
- Bless me Father,
for I have sinned.

12:43.003 --> 12:45.695
My last confession was, um…

12:45.799 --> 12:47.525
well, it was quite a while ago.

12:47.628 --> 12:49.527
- How long are we talking about?

12:49.630 --> 12:52.116
- I'm afraid it's been years.

12:52.185 --> 12:53.531
- Okay, then.

12:53.634 --> 12:55.567
May the Lord be in your heart

12:55.671 --> 13:00.020
and help you to confess
your sins with true sorrow.

13:02.022 --> 13:04.680
- Father, the truth is,
I'm in sort of a bind.

13:04.749 --> 13:09.271
I'm married, but I'm in love
with another woman.

13:09.374 --> 13:11.687
She's actually a member
of your church.

13:13.447 --> 13:17.037
- You're Liz Egan's friend.
- I am.

13:17.106 --> 13:19.074
- Did she send you to me?
- She did.

13:19.177 --> 13:21.939
I-I told her I wanted to start
taking communion again.

13:22.042 --> 13:23.733
She advised
that I come talk to you.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.114
But the truth is,

13:25.218 --> 13:26.944
you're actually more
than friends,

13:27.047 --> 13:31.189
and she isn't aware
of your current situation,

13:31.258 --> 13:34.952
and you're here
looking for advice.

13:35.055 --> 13:37.989
- That's correct, Father.

13:38.058 --> 13:41.544
- Well, you'd better tell her
the truth about your wife.

13:41.613 --> 13:43.753
I've known Liz a long time.

13:43.857 --> 13:47.412
I served that girl
her first communion.

13:47.481 --> 13:50.726
Honesty is everything to her.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.417
- I-I plan on telling her
very soon,

13:52.486 --> 13:53.971
but first I need to get out

13:54.074 --> 13:56.145
of my marriage
with minimal damage.

13:56.249 --> 13:58.630
My current wife is extremely
devoted to her faith,

13:58.734 --> 14:00.218
and I'm seeing her
for dinner this week.

14:00.287 --> 14:02.634
I was hoping we could start
a dialogue.

14:02.738 --> 14:05.223
- I'm afraid
divorce in the Catholic Church

14:05.292 --> 14:07.743
doesn't occur
without consequence.

14:07.812 --> 14:12.990
And annulling a marriage is
a long and difficult process.

14:13.093 --> 14:17.201
And perhaps the single most
important aspect

14:17.270 --> 14:19.444
of this process

14:19.513 --> 14:21.895
is that it needs to be mutual.

14:43.606 --> 14:46.437
- Here we have
a 13th century illustration

14:46.506 --> 14:48.266
from the Book of Games.

14:48.335 --> 14:50.751
A Christian and a Muslim
playing chess.

14:50.820 --> 14:52.822
It's a game of strategy
modeled on war.

14:52.926 --> 14:55.032
You can play it fast.
You can play it slow.

14:55.135 --> 14:57.517
A single game can last for days.

14:57.620 --> 15:00.037
The game of chess
originated in India

15:00.140 --> 15:01.279
and made its way to Europe

15:01.348 --> 15:02.453
by way of Islamic

15:02.522 --> 15:03.661
and Byzantine transmission

15:03.764 --> 15:05.697
by the 11th century.

15:05.801 --> 15:09.046
In literature there's strong
evidence of Muslim influence

15:09.149 --> 15:10.495
in Christian masterworks.

15:42.182 --> 15:44.874
- Those are the Gancio Bit
loafers by Ferragamo.

15:44.978 --> 15:47.118
The finest black patent leather.

15:47.187 --> 15:49.500
Would you like to try them on?

15:49.569 --> 15:52.330
- Um… how much?

15:52.399 --> 15:55.230
- Those are currently on sale
for 425.

16:24.845 --> 16:28.090
And six calls in Kuala Lumpur.

16:33.026 --> 16:35.753
Who the hell
is this Ahmed Al-Hada?

16:35.856 --> 16:38.273
- And why is he getting
all these calls?

16:38.376 --> 16:39.584
- They're coming in
from Afghanistan.

16:39.688 --> 16:41.897
Pakistan. Malaysia.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.900
- Is this guy at the level
of UBL?

16:54.461 --> 16:57.257
- He obviously has
some kind of power.

17:06.473 --> 17:07.681
You're so skinny.

17:07.750 --> 17:09.200
Don't they feed you in New York?

17:09.269 --> 17:10.857
- I promise you
I eat like a horse.

17:10.925 --> 17:12.376
The city takes
the weight off you.

17:13.308 --> 17:14.861
- New clothes, by the way.

17:14.964 --> 17:16.483
Thank you, Mama.

17:16.587 --> 17:18.589
- And those shoes. I thought the
government didn't pay you well.

17:18.796 --> 17:19.935
- I find the bargains.

17:22.179 --> 17:23.076
What's this?

17:23.455 --> 17:25.113
- What does it look like?

17:28.806 --> 17:29.703
- She's taking the veil?

17:30.532 --> 17:32.258
- I hope you're going to mosque.

17:33.569 --> 17:34.777
- I have been recently.

17:39.092 --> 17:42.199
- How's school?
- School's fine.

17:42.647 --> 17:44.304
When did you start wearing that?

17:44.408 --> 17:47.100
- Last month. You don't approve?

17:47.169 --> 17:48.205
- No, no, I approve.

17:48.308 --> 17:51.035
I'm just surprised.

17:51.139 --> 17:54.452
- Come make a plate before Mom
gets very, very disappointed.

17:56.489 --> 17:58.111
- Hey.

18:00.596 --> 18:03.151
Make sure you fill it up.

18:05.705 --> 18:08.673
- Hi.
- You must be Ali.

18:08.742 --> 18:11.780
- I am. And you are?
- Foziah.

18:13.126 --> 18:14.472
- So you know my sister?

18:14.541 --> 18:16.681
- I know your sister
and your mother.

18:16.750 --> 18:19.167
I moved to Scranton
three years ago.

18:19.236 --> 18:20.858
- You have a Lebanese accent.

18:20.961 --> 18:22.998
You have a good ear.

18:23.171 --> 18:24.103
- Beirut?

18:24.965 --> 18:25.828
- Zahlah.

18:26.864 --> 18:29.280
- So what brought you
to the States?

18:29.349 --> 18:32.559
- Uh, my studies.
I'm in nursing school.

18:32.663 --> 18:34.699
Just finished my third semester.

18:34.768 --> 18:37.495
- Congratulations.
Is it going well?

18:37.564 --> 18:39.877
- So far, yes.

18:39.980 --> 18:41.879
Your sister says
you live in New York.

18:41.982 --> 18:44.053
- In Brooklyn. Have you been?

18:44.157 --> 18:46.470
- Uh, last year
during semester break I visited

18:46.539 --> 18:48.092
for the weekend.

18:48.196 --> 18:50.612
I went ice skating
in Rockefeller Center,

18:50.715 --> 18:53.511
which was fun,
although I fell down more

18:53.580 --> 18:54.961
than all the children.

18:55.064 --> 18:56.756
Mostly just felt like
a stupid tourist,

18:56.859 --> 18:58.896
but I would like to
someday live there.

18:58.999 --> 19:02.313
- Everyone dreams
of New York City.

19:02.382 --> 19:04.695
- I see you two
have finally met.

19:15.602 --> 19:17.259
Willa, stop picking
at your green beans.

19:17.363 --> 19:19.019
This isn't an art project.

19:20.849 --> 19:22.713
- How's soccer practice?

19:22.782 --> 19:24.335
- All we do is run.

19:24.404 --> 19:26.510
Well, conditioning's important.

19:26.579 --> 19:29.720
You don't want to run out of
gas late in the second period.

19:29.789 --> 19:31.929
- Half.
- What?

19:32.032 --> 19:34.483
- Soccer has two halves.

19:34.587 --> 19:37.590
- Hockey has periods.
- Right.

19:53.813 --> 19:55.159
Dinner was terrific.

19:55.263 --> 19:56.919
That meatloaf.

19:58.438 --> 20:00.371
- The girls love seeing you.

20:00.440 --> 20:02.753
- Well, I'm not so sure
about that.

20:02.822 --> 20:05.065
Celia can barely look at me.

20:05.134 --> 20:07.136
- She's just going
through a phase.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.552
- Yeah, what, an anti-Dad phase?

20:08.621 --> 20:09.794
I smiled at her.

20:09.863 --> 20:11.348
She practically turned to stone.

20:11.451 --> 20:13.764
- She misses you.

20:13.833 --> 20:15.628
She's just shy about it.

20:19.252 --> 20:20.978
You staying the night?

20:21.081 --> 20:23.152
I'm happy to make up the sofa
for you.

20:23.256 --> 20:24.982
- I gotta work early
in New York,

20:25.085 --> 20:27.812
then I'm headed to D.C.

20:27.881 --> 20:31.160
I think I'll pay a visit
to Cardinal Hickey.

20:31.264 --> 20:32.990
- Why are you going to see
Cardinal Hickey?

20:33.093 --> 20:35.613
Is his health okay?
- Routine visit.

20:35.682 --> 20:39.099
I'll bring him some cigars,
shoot the breeze.

20:39.168 --> 20:41.101
He did marry us, after all.

20:41.170 --> 20:44.001
- He certainly did.

20:44.104 --> 20:46.486
Please give him my best.

20:58.567 --> 21:00.638
And what kind
of a bird hunt is this?

21:00.707 --> 21:02.709
They're hunting
the houbara bustard.

21:02.813 --> 21:04.711
It's an endangered bird

21:04.815 --> 21:07.058
known for its speed and cunning,

21:07.162 --> 21:10.648
as well as its potency
as an aphrodisiac.

21:10.717 --> 21:13.410
- So you want to launch
a missile

21:13.513 --> 21:17.862
at a campsite that includes
UAE royal falconers.

21:17.931 --> 21:19.450
- Yes, sir, they'll be encamped
in the desert

21:19.519 --> 21:20.865
just south of Kandahar.

21:20.934 --> 21:22.211
And I believe the probability

21:22.315 --> 21:24.317
of dispatching UBL
is extraordinary.

21:24.386 --> 21:26.423
- Have you pitched this
to Richard Clarke?

21:26.526 --> 21:27.562
- I'm pitching it to you.

21:27.665 --> 21:29.218
- Why aren't you
in Leonard Bliss' office?

21:29.322 --> 21:30.875
He's your immediate superior.

21:30.944 --> 21:32.808
This is extremely
time-sensitive.

21:32.877 --> 21:34.672
Sir, um…

21:34.741 --> 21:37.468
if we're serious
about neutralizing al-Qaeda,

21:37.537 --> 21:39.884
I really believe this is
an incredibly important moment.

21:39.953 --> 21:44.268
We may never have another shot
as clear as we do now.

21:44.372 --> 21:46.684
I'm getting hourly updates
from Pakistan that say

21:46.753 --> 21:48.859
that Bin Laden
is going to be there.

21:48.928 --> 21:50.688
- Martin, the chain of command
is an important,

21:50.757 --> 21:52.690
I would even say essential,
system

21:52.759 --> 21:54.243
for effective agency function.

21:54.347 --> 21:56.694
Would you agree
with that assertion?

21:56.763 --> 21:59.904
- Even the finest of systems
has its flaws.

21:59.973 --> 22:03.114
- Is that so?
- In physics…

22:03.218 --> 22:07.256
there is, well, degradation
in an isolated system.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.534
For instance,

22:08.603 --> 22:09.707
when two billiard balls collide,

22:09.776 --> 22:11.295
there is consequence.

22:11.399 --> 22:14.091
The energy available
for more work is lessened.

22:14.194 --> 22:15.713
Momentum is compromised.

22:15.782 --> 22:17.474
- Are you suggesting
there's some degradation

22:17.577 --> 22:19.268
here at the Agency?
- No, sir, but at times,

22:19.372 --> 22:21.236
there may be a lack of momentum.

22:22.962 --> 22:24.722
- Martin.

22:24.791 --> 22:26.724
Might I make a suggestion?

22:26.793 --> 22:28.105
- Of course.

22:28.208 --> 22:29.140
Save your physics metaphors

22:29.244 --> 22:30.763
for later in life

22:30.832 --> 22:32.730
when you are regaling
naive college students

22:32.799 --> 22:34.629
about your legendary time
at the Agency.

22:34.732 --> 22:38.426
Use the chain of command.
It exists for a reason.

22:38.529 --> 22:41.118
In other words…

22:41.221 --> 22:43.603
get the hell out of my office.

23:00.240 --> 23:02.726
Leonard Bliss, please.

23:02.795 --> 23:04.313
George Tenet.

23:05.798 --> 23:07.144
Hey, Leonard.

23:07.247 --> 23:08.421
Guess who was just in my office.

24:13.728 --> 24:17.007
"Qimma" means
"mountaintop" or "peak."

24:17.076 --> 24:18.387
What mountain?

24:18.491 --> 24:19.837
Why are they going
to a mountain?

24:19.906 --> 24:21.218
- I doubt
they're into hang gliding.

24:21.321 --> 24:23.772
Qimma, qimma, qimma…

24:23.876 --> 24:27.017
it's like "Aqaba"
from "Lawrence of Arabia."

24:27.086 --> 24:29.606
- "Aqaba, Aqaba, Aqaba…"

24:29.709 --> 24:32.056
- Oh, I love all the camels
in that movie.

24:32.125 --> 24:34.265
The camels?
What about Peter O'Toole?

24:34.369 --> 24:35.922
Doesn't he have
just the bluest eyes?

24:36.026 --> 24:37.683
And they really surge
when the Bedouins

24:37.752 --> 24:39.581
give him those desert robes
to wear.

24:39.650 --> 24:41.410
I think he looks like
Julie Andrews half the time.

24:41.514 --> 24:42.929
Well, and then
there's Anthony Quinn

24:43.033 --> 24:44.413
wearing all that fake tanner.

24:44.517 --> 24:46.623
"My mother mated
with a scorpion."

24:46.726 --> 24:49.384
"Aqaba…"

25:07.367 --> 25:09.266
- What is it?

25:09.369 --> 25:11.406
- It's not the messenger.

25:13.166 --> 25:16.169
They're not calling him.
It's the message.

25:16.273 --> 25:22.072
Ahmed al-Hada is the goddamn
al-Qaeda switchboard.

25:22.141 --> 25:25.420
- Hada's the conduit?
- He's simply…

25:25.524 --> 25:28.803
relaying messages.

25:28.906 --> 25:30.149
- Summit!

25:30.252 --> 25:31.322
Wait, what about summit?

25:31.426 --> 25:32.910
- Qimma is not mountaintop.

25:32.979 --> 25:34.463
- But it is mountaintop.
- It's a homonym.

25:34.567 --> 25:36.327
- That's the literal
translation from Arabic.

25:36.431 --> 25:38.191
- Qimma means mountaintop,
but it also means summit.

25:38.295 --> 25:41.263
- A summit meeting.
- In Malaysia.

25:41.332 --> 25:44.404
All roads lead
to Southeast Asia.

25:46.959 --> 25:48.547
- Qimma…

26:59.790 --> 27:02.137
Ready! Aim!

27:02.206 --> 27:03.242
Fire!

27:15.530 --> 27:17.774
- Vince Stuart.
- What's a guy got to do to get

27:17.877 --> 27:19.396
a good 12-ounce filet
around here?

27:19.499 --> 27:20.915
- Boss.

27:21.018 --> 27:22.744
How's life on the walrus farm?

27:22.848 --> 27:24.781
- They're wearing sweaters
in August.

27:24.884 --> 27:26.610
They don't even know
what season we're in.

27:26.714 --> 27:28.681
It's 82 degrees outside.
They never leave the building.

27:28.750 --> 27:31.580
You have no idea how glad
I am to hear your voice.

27:31.684 --> 27:33.962
- You got anything for me
on this Hada guy?

27:34.066 --> 27:36.516
- Hold on.
I'll call you right back.

27:52.532 --> 27:53.948
- Excuse me.

28:26.152 --> 28:27.947
- Talk to me.
- Boss, I got nothin'.

28:28.016 --> 28:30.294
They're slugging me out
on all the cables.

28:30.363 --> 28:32.089
They fucking close the blinds

28:32.158 --> 28:33.884
every time I walk by
the conference room.

28:33.953 --> 28:35.265
What about Toni-Ann?

28:35.334 --> 28:36.645
- Same situation, they…

28:38.544 --> 28:41.064
They treat us like
we're their friggin' hostages.

28:41.133 --> 28:42.651
- Listen to me.

28:42.755 --> 28:44.515
You and Toni-Ann
keep a low profile.

28:44.619 --> 28:47.139
I'm gonna see what I can
come up with on my end.

29:34.393 --> 29:36.188
A redundancy?

29:36.257 --> 29:37.914
I'm the one who's been
leading this thing.

29:38.017 --> 29:40.364
- Oh, yeah? As I see it,
you're leading Alec Station

29:40.433 --> 29:42.539
into a wild goose chase
of absurdity.

29:42.642 --> 29:44.575
It's like watching
the Marx Brothers.

29:44.679 --> 29:46.923
"Animal Crackers" makes
more sense to me!

29:47.026 --> 29:48.372
Look what happened in Khost.

29:48.441 --> 29:50.547
Or should I say,
what didn't happen.

29:50.616 --> 29:52.376
Zawahiri's probably laughing
at us

29:52.445 --> 29:55.207
in some fucking shag-carpeted
cave in the Tora Bora.

29:55.276 --> 29:58.555
- Well, you can't fire me,
Leonard.

29:58.658 --> 30:00.384
You can move me
to the broom closet,

30:00.453 --> 30:03.180
you can make me process
meaningless cables all day,

30:03.249 --> 30:05.804
but you cannot fire me.

30:07.909 --> 30:12.224
Once in the Agency,
always in the Agency, right?

30:16.262 --> 30:18.161
- Ahmed al-Hada.
What's the update?

30:18.230 --> 30:20.197
- I'm trading calls
with Alec Station.

30:20.266 --> 30:22.959
- You're trading?
- Well, I'm calling.

30:23.062 --> 30:24.408
They're not calling me back.

30:24.477 --> 30:25.858
- How many times have you tried?

30:25.927 --> 30:27.964
- Five.
I'm happy to keep at it.

30:28.067 --> 30:29.206
- No, don't worry about it.

30:29.275 --> 30:30.759
Thanks, Margie.

30:30.863 --> 30:33.279
Could you close the door
on your way out?

30:38.077 --> 30:40.562
- U.S. Attorney's office.
- Mary Jo White, please.

30:40.631 --> 30:43.220
John O'Neill, line one.

30:46.741 --> 30:48.950
- John O'Neill,
the best dressed Bureau man

30:49.054 --> 30:50.676
since James B. Adams.

30:50.779 --> 30:52.781
- How are you, Mary Jo?
- I'm sleep deprived

30:52.885 --> 30:54.473
but hanging in there.

30:54.576 --> 30:55.992
- Well, show me
a United States attorney

30:56.095 --> 30:57.441
that gets eight hours' sleep
at night

30:57.510 --> 30:59.029
and I'll show you
a flying rhinoceros.

30:59.098 --> 31:00.617
Hey, as long as
the Yankees keep winning,

31:00.720 --> 31:02.584
I got nothing to complain about.

31:02.653 --> 31:04.310
- Yeah, let's hope they don't
blow it in the postseason

31:04.414 --> 31:05.622
like they did last year.

31:05.725 --> 31:07.244
- Not a chance. Not this team.

31:07.313 --> 31:08.797
We got the secret weapon.

31:08.901 --> 31:11.455
- Yeah? Who's that?
- Chuck Knoblauch.

31:11.524 --> 31:13.250
He's like
the human Swiss Army knife,

31:13.319 --> 31:15.804
can do a little bit
of everything.

31:15.908 --> 31:17.806
How are you, John?

31:17.910 --> 31:20.844
- To be honest, no so great.
- Talk to me.

31:20.948 --> 31:23.019
- I'm trying to get the take
from a suspect in Yemen

31:23.122 --> 31:25.262
that I believe is linked
to Bin Laden and al-Qaeda,

31:25.331 --> 31:27.816
but the jackimoes
over at Alec Station

31:27.920 --> 31:29.646
are being stingy.

31:29.715 --> 31:31.096
I even got two people
working in their unit,

31:31.165 --> 31:32.649
but they're completely
icing them out.

31:32.752 --> 31:34.306
I'm at the end of my rope here.

31:34.409 --> 31:36.273
- Did you call
the counterterrorism AD?

31:36.342 --> 31:39.276
I did, and been
calling Alec Station all day,

31:39.345 --> 31:40.760
but, you know,
I'm running out of patience.

31:40.829 --> 31:42.141
- What about Louis Freeh?

31:42.245 --> 31:43.660
- The utterance of his name
alone

31:43.763 --> 31:45.455
is like a knife in my spleen.

31:45.524 --> 31:47.077
That bad, huh?

31:47.146 --> 31:48.492
- In all seriousness, Mary Jo,

31:48.561 --> 31:50.287
I'm getting low on options here.

31:50.356 --> 31:52.289
Is there someone
you can talk to at Justice?

31:52.358 --> 31:53.704
I gotta have whatever intel

31:53.808 --> 31:55.292
they might have on this guy
in Yemen.

31:55.361 --> 31:57.156
His name is Ahmed al-Hada.

31:57.260 --> 31:59.158
- I'm writing
that name down now.

31:59.262 --> 32:04.060
Ahmed al-Hada.

32:04.163 --> 32:06.096
John…

32:06.165 --> 32:09.306
I'd be happy to put in a call
to Janet Reno for you.

32:09.375 --> 32:11.412
- I'm buying you dinner
at Delmonico's.

32:11.515 --> 32:13.448
- But I can't promise you
anything.

32:23.976 --> 32:25.702
- Jeff.
- Jim.

32:25.771 --> 32:28.084
- Jim, right.
What can I do for you?

32:28.187 --> 32:31.259
- Um… maybe we should,
uh, go into your office.

32:31.363 --> 32:33.020
- No, we shouldn't.

32:33.123 --> 32:37.127
- Okay, then, uh…
- What's this?

32:37.196 --> 32:39.888
- It's a report that shows
your credit card was declined

32:39.992 --> 32:41.821
at Duane Street Tavern
the other night.

32:44.410 --> 32:48.345
- Do me a favor and nod once
and walk away from me.

32:49.208 --> 32:50.416
- Wh…

32:54.213 --> 32:56.526
- Nod one time,

32:56.595 --> 32:58.907
and walk…

32:59.011 --> 33:00.979
away.

33:11.058 --> 33:12.921
Fucking mosquito.

33:15.407 --> 33:17.443
Shred that.

35:08.347 --> 35:11.039
- I hate to say it, John, but…

35:11.143 --> 35:13.870
regarding your prospects
with Elizabeth,

35:13.973 --> 35:16.700
you're looking
at an uphill battle.

35:16.769 --> 35:18.702
In order to remarry
within the Church,

35:18.771 --> 35:21.912
you have to first nullify
your current marriage.

35:22.016 --> 35:25.123
It sounds like Maria isn't
necessarily gonna cooperate.

35:25.192 --> 35:27.884
- She's still hanging on.
To what, I don't know.

35:27.987 --> 35:30.266
- She obviously still loves you.

35:30.369 --> 35:32.716
- Oh, we've been over
for a long time, Cardinal.

35:32.785 --> 35:34.615
- When you and Maria
got married,

35:34.718 --> 35:37.100
you took an oath before God,

35:37.204 --> 35:39.861
and there are consequences
for breaking that oath.

35:39.930 --> 35:42.933
If the marriage
is not properly nullified,

35:43.037 --> 35:46.937
then not only can you not
remarry within the church

35:47.041 --> 35:50.527
but you cannot receive
the Holy Eucharist.

35:50.596 --> 35:51.908
- What about Maria?

35:52.011 --> 35:53.461
Would she be able
to take communion?

35:53.565 --> 35:55.567
- No, not under
these circumstances.

35:55.670 --> 35:56.913
- But my abandoning
the marriage,

35:57.016 --> 35:58.915
it wasn't…
that wasn't her fault.

35:58.984 --> 36:00.744
- Unfortunately,
God does not see it that way.

36:00.813 --> 36:02.263
- Well, Maria has to
take communion.

36:02.367 --> 36:03.540
It's that important to her.

36:03.609 --> 36:05.197
- As it should be.

36:06.819 --> 36:10.961
You came to me today
looking for a loophole.

36:11.065 --> 36:15.621
Well, we are in Washington.

36:15.725 --> 36:17.968
- You sure there's not some
little crack in the magisterium

36:18.072 --> 36:21.731
that would allow Maria
to maintain her good standing?

36:21.800 --> 36:23.733
- Well…

36:23.802 --> 36:25.666
if you were to die.

36:25.769 --> 36:28.324
How's that for a loophole?

36:28.427 --> 36:30.567
John, if you're serious
about marrying Elizabeth,

36:30.636 --> 36:32.466
talk to your wife.

36:54.660 --> 36:57.318
- He bivouacs among the stacks.

37:01.460 --> 37:03.738
- Cast out like Quasimodo.

37:09.088 --> 37:11.367
- From the ladies and me.

37:11.470 --> 37:13.679
- Worried I'll get scurvy?

37:16.682 --> 37:21.998
- In China,
an orange symbolizes life,

37:22.101 --> 37:24.380
a new beginning.

37:24.483 --> 37:27.383
- Then I better not eat it.

37:27.486 --> 37:29.626
- Martin, you started this.

37:29.695 --> 37:31.421
Nobody else at the Agency
foresaw

37:31.490 --> 37:32.802
what's happening with al-Qaeda.

37:32.871 --> 37:34.528
You are the prophet.

37:34.631 --> 37:36.426
We wouldn't have gotten
the Hada phone

37:36.495 --> 37:37.841
or the Malaysia meeting

37:37.910 --> 37:39.878
without your leadership,
your vision.

37:39.981 --> 37:42.190
Every single person
at Alec Station is devoted

37:42.294 --> 37:43.813
to cracking this thing.

37:43.882 --> 37:45.849
The ladies and I are working
around the clock,

37:45.918 --> 37:48.818
and we're constantly asking
ourselves,

37:48.887 --> 37:51.855
"What would Martin think?"

37:51.924 --> 37:55.065
- What about Bliss?
- Bliss…

37:55.169 --> 37:58.414
is a coat hanger
with a cheap shirt on it.

37:58.517 --> 38:02.452
He has nothing of
your knowledge and instinct.

38:02.521 --> 38:05.455
And fuck Bliss.

38:05.524 --> 38:08.044
Right now, I'm here with you,

38:08.147 --> 38:10.080
and I will keep coming
to see you,

38:10.184 --> 38:13.221
and I'll bring you news
of our progress.

38:18.744 --> 38:22.748
You have my undivided devotion,
Martin.

38:25.544 --> 38:28.098
You have to believe me.

38:29.548 --> 38:32.344
- I believe you.

39:49.076 --> 39:50.698
Glory be to Allah.

39:59.086 --> 40:01.778
It is as if Allah himself
has sent you to us.

40:04.678 --> 40:08.164
- As Saudi citizens…

40:08.371 --> 40:12.858
you can easily
acquire U.S. visas.

40:20.452 --> 40:22.799
- So my sister introduces me
to this woman.

40:22.868 --> 40:25.353
She's clearly Lebanese.
Speaks excellent English.

40:25.457 --> 40:27.010
Very good accent.
- What's her name?

40:27.079 --> 40:28.667
- Foziah.
She's new to Scranton.

40:28.736 --> 40:30.980
So we're having
a perfectly nice conversation

40:31.049 --> 40:32.602
when my mother interrupts.

40:32.671 --> 40:36.364
She is so pleased
we're finally talking.

40:36.468 --> 40:40.196
It turns out the whole thing
is a setup.

40:40.299 --> 40:42.888
- Like a setupsetup.
- Yeah.

40:46.098 --> 40:48.515
- What did you think of her?
Was she nice?

40:48.618 --> 40:50.586
- She was very nice.

40:50.689 --> 40:53.830
- Pretty?
- She was pretty.

40:53.899 --> 40:56.384
- Good body?

40:56.488 --> 40:58.835
- She seemed fit.

40:58.904 --> 41:00.216
But I couldn't really tell.

41:00.319 --> 41:01.838
She wore long pants
and a blouse.

41:01.907 --> 41:03.909
Well, it's all about
the collarbones.

41:04.013 --> 41:05.221
If they're pronounced,
it usually means

41:05.324 --> 41:07.223
that they have a good body.

41:07.326 --> 41:09.605
Good collarbones, good ass.

41:09.708 --> 41:11.399
Fuzzy?

41:11.503 --> 41:12.849
- Foziah.

41:12.918 --> 41:15.127
- What did you and Foziah
talk about?

41:15.231 --> 41:17.854
- The food. The company.
Her studies.

41:17.923 --> 41:21.651
She's enrolled in the nursing
program at the local college.

41:23.342 --> 41:25.413
What?

41:25.517 --> 41:26.622
- What are you doing right now?

41:26.725 --> 41:28.071
- I'm, um, telling you about

41:28.140 --> 41:31.419
my visit to my mother's house.

41:31.523 --> 41:33.180
Look…

41:33.249 --> 41:35.631
I like you, Ali.

41:35.734 --> 41:37.978
I really do.
I like you a lot.

41:38.081 --> 41:39.427
But I have to be honest
with you.

41:39.531 --> 41:40.877
I don't…
I don't really understand

41:40.946 --> 41:42.465
what's going on right now.

41:42.569 --> 41:46.434
I mean, you're, like,
this incredibly handsome,

41:46.538 --> 41:49.852
seemingly thoughtful,
seemingly soulful,

41:49.921 --> 41:53.303
uh… enigma.

41:53.407 --> 41:55.651
All I know about you
is that you grew up in Beirut,

41:55.754 --> 41:57.273
you lived through the civil war,

41:57.376 --> 41:58.895
and that you work
for the government

41:58.964 --> 42:01.967
in some mysterious,
classified way.

42:02.071 --> 42:03.279
- All of this is true.

42:03.382 --> 42:04.625
- And then every time
we get together,

42:04.729 --> 42:05.799
your phone eventually rings,

42:05.902 --> 42:08.629
and you get pulled away
on some job thing.

42:09.388 --> 42:10.389
- Every time?

42:10.666 --> 42:13.565
- We've been on three dates,
and it's happened three times.

42:16.775 --> 42:18.225
- It's off.

42:20.399 --> 42:23.126
- I guess what I'm wondering is,

42:23.195 --> 42:26.923
what exactly do you want
from me?

42:26.992 --> 42:29.926
Do you want to be my buddy?
'Cause we could do that.

42:29.995 --> 42:31.583
We could, like, get together
once a week,

42:31.652 --> 42:33.481
drink 40s, play video games,

42:33.585 --> 42:34.931
down a few pints of Haagen Dazs.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.795
We could do
the crossword puzzle.

42:36.899 --> 42:38.659
- Heather, I'm trying
to tell you about my life.

42:38.763 --> 42:40.488
- But like a buddy.
- Not like a buddy.

42:40.592 --> 42:41.938
- You just spent
the last five minutes

42:42.007 --> 42:43.940
telling me about Franzia.

42:44.009 --> 42:45.321
- Foziah.
- Whatever her name is.

42:45.424 --> 42:47.323
That's what buddies do.

42:47.392 --> 42:50.326
They tell each other anecdotes
about their dating lives.

42:50.395 --> 42:52.949
- I have absolutely no interest
in Foziah.

42:53.018 --> 42:56.712
- Pretty, well-spoken,
nicely put together Foziah?

42:56.815 --> 42:59.162
- I'm positive, and I don't
want to play video games

42:59.231 --> 43:01.371
with you either, okay?
- Really? Are you sure?

43:01.475 --> 43:04.512
Because there's this new game
out on PlayStation.

43:04.616 --> 43:05.893
"Gran Turismo."

43:05.997 --> 43:07.757
High-end car racing.

43:07.826 --> 43:09.725
Apparently the graphics
are super lifelike.

43:09.828 --> 43:11.140
My students are raving about it.

43:11.209 --> 43:12.969
- Seriously, Heather.

43:13.038 --> 43:16.352
I definitely want us to be
more than buddies.

43:16.455 --> 43:18.354
- Oh, really?

43:18.457 --> 43:20.494
Do you want to talk
more about that?

43:22.461 --> 43:25.775
- I would do things. With you.

43:25.844 --> 43:28.364
To you. With…

43:28.467 --> 43:31.850
fervent intensity
and great care.

43:35.854 --> 43:38.374
- Oh.

43:38.477 --> 43:41.170
Okay, then.

43:41.239 --> 43:43.068
Are you still hungry?

43:43.172 --> 43:45.001
- Why?

43:45.070 --> 43:47.038
- Would you like some ice cream?
- No.

43:47.107 --> 43:49.385
I want to take you home.

43:49.488 --> 43:51.559
To my place.

43:51.663 --> 43:54.666
Where there are no video games.

44:00.120 --> 44:02.432
- They are acting
as if we are the chosen ones.

44:05.263 --> 44:06.851
- Why are you doubting this?

44:11.579 --> 44:13.029
- I'm not.

44:16.757 --> 44:18.310
- You don't looked convinced.

44:24.075 --> 44:25.973
- Hoda is pregnant.

44:29.045 --> 44:32.048
- Then Allah will take care
of her.

44:54.622 --> 44:58.143
- I could watch
you sleep all morning.

45:02.734 --> 45:05.288
- Is it…

45:05.357 --> 45:06.876
sort of like watching
a homeless guy

45:06.945 --> 45:08.844
who passes out at the movies?

45:08.947 --> 45:11.087
- Not at all.

45:11.156 --> 45:14.263
- Was I snoring?
Thrashing around?

45:14.332 --> 45:17.266
- No, the opposite. You…

45:17.335 --> 45:19.717
you hardly even move.

45:33.765 --> 45:35.422
By the way…

45:37.631 --> 45:42.670
It looks like I might
be moving to New York.

45:42.774 --> 45:44.638
- New York City?

45:46.191 --> 45:48.884
- No, New York, South Dakota.

45:48.987 --> 45:51.679
Of course, New York City.

45:51.783 --> 45:54.303
Lou wants me to manage one
of our new branches

45:54.372 --> 45:56.132
in the East Village.

45:58.376 --> 46:01.103
- That's great news, Sher.

46:01.172 --> 46:04.037
Congratulations.

46:26.818 --> 46:28.544
- You have
beautiful collarbones,

46:28.647 --> 46:29.683
by the way.
