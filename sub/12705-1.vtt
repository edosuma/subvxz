WEBVTT

00:02.770 --> 00:05.405
(crickets chirping,
owl hoots)

00:20.288 --> 00:27.027
(growling)

00:30.797 --> 00:32.500
That's right, big boy.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.902
Come and get it.

00:34.935 --> 00:37.070
(growls)

00:37.104 --> 00:39.372
(grunts)
(growls)

00:39.406 --> 00:40.874
I got him!
Come on.

00:40.908 --> 00:42.176
(growling continues)

00:42.210 --> 00:44.411
Any time now.

00:45.978 --> 00:48.615
(grunting)

00:48.649 --> 00:50.084
(groaning)

00:50.951 --> 00:52.420
He's getting away!

00:52.453 --> 00:54.588
And... ow.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.759
(growling)

00:59.960 --> 01:03.396
(wind whipping, clink)

01:03.430 --> 01:05.865
That really never works.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.935
Are you guys all right?

01:07.968 --> 01:09.537
XANDER:
First of all,

01:09.569 --> 01:11.971
what was with the acrobatics?

01:12.004 --> 01:13.774
How did that happen?

01:13.807 --> 01:16.444
Wasn't Andy Hoelich
on the gymnastics team?

01:16.477 --> 01:19.712
That's right, he was.
Cheater!

01:19.746 --> 01:23.450
Okay, and the, uh,
second problem I'm having...

01:23.484 --> 01:25.753
"Come and get it, big boy?"

01:25.786 --> 01:29.956
Well... Well, the Slayer
always says a pun

01:29.989 --> 01:31.658
or-or a witty
play on words, and

01:31.692 --> 01:34.061
I think it throws
the vampires off and...

01:34.093 --> 01:36.597
and it makes them frightened
because I'm wisecracking.

01:36.629 --> 01:39.266
Okay, I didn't really have
a chance to work on that one,

01:39.299 --> 01:41.001
but you try it every time.

01:41.033 --> 01:42.436
Uh, if I may
suggest...

01:42.469 --> 01:44.572
"This time it's personal."

01:44.604 --> 01:46.906
I mean, there's a reason
why it's a classic.

01:46.939 --> 01:49.676
I've always been amazed
with how Buffy fought, but,

01:49.710 --> 01:52.412
in a way, I feel like
we took her punning for granted.

01:52.445 --> 01:54.948
Xander, past tense rule.

01:54.981 --> 01:57.084
Oh, sorry. I just meant

01:57.116 --> 01:59.152
we, in the past,
took it for granted

01:59.186 --> 02:02.222
and, um, we won't
when she gets back.

02:03.823 --> 02:06.793
Do you think Buffy knows
school's starting tomorrow?

02:06.826 --> 02:08.461
Tomorrow.

02:09.362 --> 02:10.764
Right.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.165
Big day.

02:12.199 --> 02:14.967
Oh, I'm gonna be busy

02:15.002 --> 02:16.770
a lot, but-but
only till 3:00,

02:16.804 --> 02:18.806
and that's when
you usually get up.

02:18.838 --> 02:20.674
I can't wait to see Cordelia.

02:20.707 --> 02:23.110
I can't believe I can't wait
to see Cordelia.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.611
WILLOW:
I wonder what

02:24.645 --> 02:26.646
our first homework
assignment's gonna be.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.449
Hey.

02:28.481 --> 02:31.284
You're excited
over Cordelia, okay?

02:31.318 --> 02:33.221
We've all got issues.

02:33.253 --> 02:35.456
I guess we should
pack it in?

02:35.489 --> 02:38.991
Yeah.

02:39.026 --> 02:41.329
Wouldn't it be great if Buffy
just showed up tomorrow?

02:41.361 --> 02:42.862
Like nothing happened?

02:42.896 --> 02:45.533
She just can't show up.
She got kicked out.

02:45.566 --> 02:49.502
Well, yeah, I know.
I just wish...

02:49.537 --> 02:51.771
I wish we knew
where she was.

02:53.441 --> 02:55.876
(waves crashing)

03:01.114 --> 03:03.783
(seagull screeching)

03:17.965 --> 03:19.900
How did you find me here?

03:19.932 --> 03:22.536
If I was blind,
I would see you.

03:28.207 --> 03:29.742
Stay with me?

03:29.776 --> 03:31.211
Forever.

03:31.245 --> 03:35.383
That's the
whole point.

03:35.415 --> 03:37.718
I'll never leave.

03:37.751 --> 03:40.152
Not even if
you kill me.

03:45.825 --> 03:48.228
(horn blaring, horn toots)

03:49.930 --> 03:51.632
(horn tooting)

03:51.664 --> 03:54.935
(car engine revving)

03:54.968 --> 03:57.305
(horn tooting)

03:57.337 --> 04:00.240
(distant, indistinct shouting)

04:00.274 --> 04:02.643
(siren blaring)

04:02.675 --> 04:04.211
(horn honking)

04:04.243 --> 04:06.580
(man shouting indistinctly)

04:06.614 --> 04:09.181
(siren blaring)

04:16.923 --> 04:20.060
(wolf howling)

04:20.093 --> 04:22.262
*

05:11.644 --> 05:13.180
WOMAN:
And if I could
get you anything else, sir?

05:13.213 --> 05:14.548
(bell tinkles)

05:14.581 --> 05:17.283
My order.
More coffee?

05:17.317 --> 05:20.653
(indistinct chatter)

05:22.322 --> 05:23.524
Anything else?

05:23.557 --> 05:25.292
That'll do us, Peaches.

05:25.324 --> 05:27.127
Pay at the counter.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.562
Sure you don't want me
to work it off for you?

05:29.596 --> 05:34.000
(bell dings, laughter)

05:34.033 --> 05:36.403
(laughing)

05:44.444 --> 05:45.913
You guys ready?
MAN:
Yeah.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.981
I think we're
good, um...

05:49.016 --> 05:51.418
Anne.

05:51.451 --> 05:53.220
What'll you have?

05:53.252 --> 05:54.588
Well, okay,

05:54.622 --> 05:58.324
what can we get
with, um... this?

05:58.358 --> 06:00.827
Um...

06:00.860 --> 06:02.194
Can we get cake?

06:02.228 --> 06:03.831
Don't be stupid.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.232
We got to eat healthy.

06:05.264 --> 06:06.867
We can't have cake.

06:06.899 --> 06:09.437
Can we get pie?

06:09.470 --> 06:11.004
We've got a peach pie.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.005
I can't guarantee
there's a peach in it.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.341
WOMAN:
We shouldn't have

06:14.374 --> 06:15.742
blown all our money.

06:15.776 --> 06:20.012
Come on, it
was worth it.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.783
Hey, check this out.

06:25.151 --> 06:26.754
It's nice.

06:26.786 --> 06:29.389
It's nice and, uh, permanent.

06:29.423 --> 06:32.391
Yeah, forever.

06:32.425 --> 06:35.394
I mean, that's
the whole point.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.367
Hey, do I know you?

06:40.399 --> 06:42.935
I don't think so.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.404
Really? Where are you from?

06:45.439 --> 06:46.939
I'll get your pie.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.279
I'm not feeling great.

06:53.312 --> 06:54.747
Do you think you
can cover for me?

06:54.781 --> 06:57.149
Sure. Okay.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.220
(indistinct chatter)

07:00.252 --> 07:02.755
So no joy at the cemetery?

07:02.790 --> 07:04.591
No, he got away.

07:04.625 --> 07:08.095
We still have some
glitches in the system, like...

07:08.127 --> 07:09.829
vampires getting away.
(chuckles)

07:09.862 --> 07:11.331
But I think we're improving.

07:11.363 --> 07:12.800
God's sake be careful.

07:12.833 --> 07:15.468
I mean, uh, you know,
I appreciate your efforts

07:15.502 --> 07:17.303
to keep the vampire
population down

07:17.336 --> 07:19.773
until Buffy returns, but, uh,

07:19.807 --> 07:22.141
well, if anything
should happen to you...

07:22.175 --> 07:25.444
and you should be killed,
I should take it somewhat amiss.

07:25.478 --> 07:28.014
You'd be cranky?
Entirely.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.283
Well, we try not
to get killed.
(phone ringing)

07:30.317 --> 07:31.752
That's part of our whole
mission statement.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.687
'"Don't get killed."

07:33.721 --> 07:36.624
Good, yes. I think
you're gonna love that book.

07:38.358 --> 07:39.692
Hi.
Hey, Willow.

07:39.726 --> 07:41.161
How was your summer?

07:41.194 --> 07:42.995
Oh, I can't believe
you brought that up.

07:43.029 --> 07:45.298
Las Palmas was
the nightmare resort.

07:45.331 --> 07:48.502
They order you around and
make you have organized "fun,"

07:48.536 --> 07:50.838
and I use sarcastic
quote marks.

07:50.870 --> 07:53.372
Plus the fact there are
cockroaches in Mexico

07:53.406 --> 07:54.875
big enough to
own property.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.810
It was all about dread.

07:56.843 --> 07:58.045
How was your summer?

07:58.077 --> 08:00.012
Oh, it was okay.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.348
Is Xander around?

08:01.380 --> 08:02.815
Well, uh, yeah,
somewhere.

08:02.850 --> 08:05.819
Good. Great. I
haven't seen him yet.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.454
Do I look okay?

08:07.487 --> 08:09.355
Oh, yeah.
How's my hair?

08:09.389 --> 08:10.990
Uh, it's good.
(sighs)

08:11.024 --> 08:13.125
He didn't meet anybody
over the summer, did he?

08:13.160 --> 08:15.728
No, who's he gonna
meet in Sunnydale,

08:15.762 --> 08:17.730
but monsters and stuff?

08:17.764 --> 08:21.468
But then again he's always
been attracted to monsters.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.002
How's my hair?

08:23.036 --> 08:24.672
Still good.

08:24.704 --> 08:27.740
Hi.
Maybe he's forgotten me.

08:27.774 --> 08:31.011
Well, I'll just have
to make him remember.

08:31.043 --> 08:32.745
See ya.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.346
You came to visit me.

08:34.380 --> 08:36.048
You came with books?

08:36.082 --> 08:37.484
Are they books for me?

08:37.517 --> 08:39.653
Well, actually,
they're kind of for me.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.087
I don't get it.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.855
Well, it's sort of
a funny story.

08:42.889 --> 08:44.725
You remember when
I didn't graduate?

08:44.758 --> 08:46.659
Well, I know you had
a lot of incompletes,

08:46.693 --> 08:48.662
but that's what
summer school was for.

08:48.696 --> 08:51.197
Yeah. Well, you remember
when I didn't go?

08:51.230 --> 08:53.500
Whoa. Slow down, people.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.235
Summer is over.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.937
Be somber.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.572
But you never
said anything.

08:58.605 --> 09:01.441
How am I supposed to react
to this rather alarming news?

09:01.474 --> 09:03.342
Well, actually, I was
pretty much banking

09:03.375 --> 09:04.912
on you finding it cute.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.513
Well traditionally, you know,

09:06.546 --> 09:09.582
repeating a grade isn't
exactly a turn-on.

09:09.616 --> 09:10.884
And-and you're practically
a genius.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.852
You're Mr. Test Scores.

09:12.885 --> 09:15.054
It's all a little weird.

09:15.087 --> 09:17.024
So the cute
thing is out?

09:17.057 --> 09:18.892
Have you guys seen Cordelia?

09:18.926 --> 09:20.360
Yeah. She's around
here somewhere.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.229
I don't want
to come on too geeky,

09:22.261 --> 09:24.697
but, uh, okay, I'm psyched.

09:24.731 --> 09:27.033
There's gonna be some heat,
if you know what I mean,

09:27.067 --> 09:30.236
so you guys might want
to duck and cover.

09:30.269 --> 09:34.274
And I'm starting to be geeky.
Okay, bye.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.809
How's my...?
Your hair is fine.

09:36.844 --> 09:38.912
Cool.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.480
This is our year,
I'm telling you.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.048
Best football season ever.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.051
I'm so in shape,
I'm a rock.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.418
It's all about
egg whites.

09:46.452 --> 09:47.955
If we can focus,
keep discipline,

09:47.988 --> 09:50.758
and not have quite as
many mysterious deaths,

09:50.790 --> 09:53.626
Sunnydale is gonna rule!

09:53.661 --> 09:55.162
I'm trying to get
to cute, really.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.429
But I'm still sort of
stuck on "strange."

09:57.463 --> 09:59.799
Well, I'd be willing
to bargain down to "eccentric"

09:59.832 --> 10:02.101
with an option on "cool."

10:02.134 --> 10:04.904
Hey.
Hey.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.438
Good summer?

10:06.472 --> 10:08.307
It was all right.

10:08.341 --> 10:09.743
Cool.

10:09.777 --> 10:13.113
Yeah.

10:13.145 --> 10:14.947
Well, I'll see ya.

10:14.981 --> 10:17.350
Yeah, whatever.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.787
(loud crowd chatter)

10:33.566 --> 10:35.969
*

10:42.676 --> 10:44.110
Hey, how are you?

10:44.144 --> 10:45.611
Can I talk to
you for a minute?

10:45.644 --> 10:47.715
Something you might
be interested in.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.548
(car horn toots)

10:49.581 --> 10:52.885
I'm no one.

10:52.919 --> 10:57.890
I'm no one.
I'm no one.

10:57.924 --> 11:00.760
Yes? Thank you. Thank you.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.197
I have a lead.

11:05.231 --> 11:06.633
A friend in Oakland

11:06.666 --> 11:08.634
has a-a sketchy report of a

11:08.668 --> 11:12.905
young girl fending off a group
of vampires about a week ago.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.807
There's a plane out
in about an hour.

11:14.841 --> 11:18.644
And what makes this different
from the last nine leads?

11:18.677 --> 11:22.215
I believe there's a meal
on this flight.

11:22.249 --> 11:24.985
Look, I don't mean to
poop the party here.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.653
It's just, you get
your hopes all up,

11:27.687 --> 11:31.158
and then it's just a big fat
raspberry, and I feel bad.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.426
But it's good that
you're looking, though.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.595
You shouldn't give up.

11:35.628 --> 11:36.996
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.431
GILES:
Yes, one must try.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.868
Well, I-I should go.

11:43.370 --> 11:46.572
You don't think
maybe he'll find her?

11:46.605 --> 11:49.542
I think he'll find her
when she wants to be found.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.913
(horn honks,
indistinct shouting)
Hey!

11:53.947 --> 11:56.615
Anne? Anne?

11:56.649 --> 11:59.052
Buffy?

12:01.120 --> 12:02.688
Don't be mad.

12:02.721 --> 12:04.224
I won't turn you in
or nothing.

12:04.256 --> 12:07.394
I guess you don't
recognize me.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.298
Lily?

12:11.331 --> 12:13.866
I mean from before.

12:13.900 --> 12:17.470
I was calling myself
Chantarelle then.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.272
I used to... (sighs)

12:19.306 --> 12:22.475
Well, I was in this cult
that worshipped vampires.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.376
So lame, I know.

12:24.411 --> 12:27.614
Yeah... I, uh...
I remember.

12:27.647 --> 12:31.217
Well, you kind of saved us.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.586
I never thanked you or anything.

12:34.620 --> 12:37.657
Did you tell
anyone who I was?

12:37.690 --> 12:39.927
Oh, no. Not-not even Rickie.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.662
I mean, I was so surprised
to see you here,

12:42.695 --> 12:45.764
waiting tables.

12:45.798 --> 12:47.734
But I wouldn't tell.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.370
I know how it is
when you got to get lost.

12:54.506 --> 12:57.009
Do you, uh... do
you live nearby?

12:57.043 --> 12:59.578
Well, there's
a couple of places.

12:59.611 --> 13:04.317
Uh, they're abandoned,
and a lot of people stay there.

13:04.350 --> 13:07.955
So, how come you came
up with "Anne"?

13:07.988 --> 13:10.157
It's my middle name.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.758
Lily's from a song.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.826
Rickie picked it.

13:13.860 --> 13:16.462
I'm always changing anyway.

13:16.495 --> 13:20.700
Chantarelle was part
of my exotic phase.

13:20.732 --> 13:26.338
It's nice. It's a...
it's a mushroom.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.942
It is?

13:28.975 --> 13:30.977
That's really
embarrassing.

13:31.010 --> 13:35.682
Um, well, it's an exotic
mushroom, if that's any comfort.

13:35.715 --> 13:37.985
Well, before that, I was
following this loser preacher

13:38.018 --> 13:42.288
and calling myself
Sister Sunshine.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.823
What do they
call you at home?

13:48.827 --> 13:51.463
I like Lily.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.500
It's cool for now.

13:53.533 --> 13:56.635
Hey, do you have
any money?

13:56.668 --> 13:58.871
Well, I didn't mean that like...

13:58.905 --> 14:03.475
Well, I just mean,
I know this guy.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.812
He's gonna have this kind of
rave thing in his basement.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.581
We could go.

14:08.615 --> 14:11.250
I mean, I could show you
if you had...

14:11.283 --> 14:13.419
Cause I'm broke.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.155
I don't think so.

14:16.188 --> 14:20.259
I just kind of...
I want to be alone.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.328
I didn't mean to bug you.

14:22.361 --> 14:25.764
No, I didn't... I didn't
mean that. It's just...

14:25.798 --> 14:29.336
Well, a lot of people like
that-- it's-it's too much.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.437
I do have the money,
though, so, why don't you

14:31.471 --> 14:33.873
and Rickie go, and then maybe I
could meet you some other time?
No.

14:33.907 --> 14:36.775
It's okay.
Forget about it. Just...

14:36.808 --> 14:39.546
That's not very polite.

14:41.748 --> 14:44.350
(horns honking)

14:44.384 --> 14:45.884
Are you okay?

14:47.955 --> 14:50.789
I'm no one.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.035
(horn honking)

15:03.070 --> 15:05.304
(grunts)

15:09.976 --> 15:13.480
(indistinct shouting)

15:13.513 --> 15:14.981
Are you okay?

15:15.014 --> 15:16.416
Geez, I didn't see you.
Oh.

15:16.448 --> 15:18.817
Oh.
Maybe-maybe you
shouldn't move.

15:18.850 --> 15:20.820
Maybe you should
lie down.
No, I'm fine.

15:20.852 --> 15:22.389
Somebody call
an ambulance!
No, I'm...

15:22.422 --> 15:24.490
Okay. I just...
I need... I need to go.

15:26.658 --> 15:29.028
(horn tooting)

15:30.163 --> 15:34.000
Oh! Whoa.

15:34.033 --> 15:36.068
Where are you
running to?

15:36.102 --> 15:38.605
Sorry.

15:38.638 --> 15:41.807
Maybe I should ask,
where are you running from?

15:43.610 --> 15:45.412
Here.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.813
You're pretty new
around here, huh?

15:47.846 --> 15:49.581
Ah, you got the look, though.

15:49.615 --> 15:52.951
The look?
Like you had to
grow up way too fast.

15:52.985 --> 15:54.354
(horn honking)

15:54.386 --> 15:55.788
What's your name?

15:55.822 --> 15:57.423
Anne.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.759
Hey, um, I'm Ken.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.660
Here, go ahead,
take one of these.

16:01.693 --> 16:03.263
(horn honking)

16:03.296 --> 16:05.932
Don't be shy
about stopping by. I mean,

16:05.965 --> 16:08.034
I guess you're not starving,
but, hey, we're not just

16:08.067 --> 16:10.102
interested in feeding the body.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.604
You might find something
you're missing.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.140
I'm all right.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.942
Then why are you here?

16:16.975 --> 16:21.181
This is not a good place
for a kid to be.

16:21.213 --> 16:23.783
You get old fast here.

16:23.816 --> 16:27.886
The thing that drains the life
out of them is despair.

16:27.919 --> 16:32.359
I mean, kids come here, and they
got nothing to go home to and...

16:32.392 --> 16:35.294
this ends up being the last stop
for a lot of 'em.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.962
(siren blaring)

16:36.995 --> 16:39.066
It shouldn't have
to be that way.

16:44.171 --> 16:47.073
* Ooh, ooh, ooh

16:47.106 --> 16:51.510
* On my way to freedom

16:54.880 --> 16:59.086
* I ask myself

16:59.119 --> 17:02.254
* Why did I come here

17:02.288 --> 17:05.592
* To find my

17:05.625 --> 17:11.198
* Own way to freedom?

17:11.230 --> 17:14.534
* And the change

17:14.567 --> 17:18.704
* Was gone, gone

17:18.738 --> 17:20.906
* I'm gonna find my way

17:20.940 --> 17:22.275
* Find my way *

17:22.308 --> 17:26.011
* Find my way
back to freedom *

17:26.045 --> 17:27.779
* Gonna find my way

17:27.814 --> 17:29.348
* Find my way *

17:29.382 --> 17:31.550
* Find my way

17:31.584 --> 17:36.989
* Find my way
back to freedom... *

17:42.561 --> 17:45.632
Boy, I'm glad we showed up
for depressing night.

17:45.664 --> 17:48.034
I wonder what she's
doing right now.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.701
Oh, I know what
she's doing.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.538
Gabbing to all of her friends

17:51.570 --> 17:54.073
about her passionate affair
with Pedro the cabana boy,

17:54.106 --> 17:55.741
laughing about me,

17:55.775 --> 17:58.111
thinking how she still might
have feelings about me.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.882
Oh, it's possible
you're talking about Buffy.

18:02.914 --> 18:04.750
It's possible.

18:04.784 --> 18:08.054
The Bronze just never
seems the same without her.

18:08.086 --> 18:10.390
Yeah, and the slaying isn't
getting any easier, either.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.292
Oh, I don't know, I think we're
kind of getting a rhythm down.

18:13.326 --> 18:15.162
We're losing half the vamps.

18:15.194 --> 18:17.763
Yeah, but... rhythmically.
WILLOW:
We just

18:17.797 --> 18:19.731
need to work
on our timing, I think.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.134
(women laughing
and chatting indistinctly)

18:21.167 --> 18:23.068
No, I know what we need.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.471
A vampire slayer?
Next best thing.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.009
Bait.
* Freedom.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.122
(knocking)

18:50.997 --> 18:53.500
Uh, hello.
GILES:
Hello.

18:53.532 --> 18:54.933
Um, may I... ?

18:54.967 --> 18:57.436
Oh, uh, of course.
Come on in.
Thank you.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.806
I've, uh, just come
back from Oakland.

18:59.838 --> 19:02.040
A friend of mine
called with a lead.

19:02.074 --> 19:04.277
Uh, stories about

19:04.310 --> 19:06.278
someone fighting vampires.

19:06.313 --> 19:08.480
But, uh, it didn't pan out,
I'm afraid.

19:09.715 --> 19:11.451
No Buffy.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.720
No vampires.

19:13.752 --> 19:15.855
Bunch of school kids
in heavy mascara

19:15.887 --> 19:18.891
listening
to extremely silly music.

19:18.924 --> 19:20.527
Well, thank you for going.

19:20.559 --> 19:22.628
I can hardly, uh...

19:22.662 --> 19:24.663
I can hardly leave the house.

19:24.696 --> 19:27.534
I'm just afraid she'll call
and she'll need my help.

19:29.101 --> 19:32.971
Buffy is the most capable
child I've ever known.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.906
I mean, she may be
confused, uh, unhappy,

19:34.941 --> 19:37.544
but I honestly believe
she's in no danger.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.580
I just wish I could talk to her.

19:41.614 --> 19:44.217
The last thing we did was fight.

19:44.250 --> 19:48.454
Joyce, you mustn't
blame yourself for her leaving.

19:49.721 --> 19:51.190
I don't.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.027
I blame you.

19:57.364 --> 20:02.000
You've been this huge
influence on her, guiding her.

20:02.034 --> 20:05.372
You had this whole relationship
with her, behind my back.

20:05.404 --> 20:09.308
I feel like
you've taken her away from me.

20:13.746 --> 20:16.348
I didn't make Buffy who she is.

20:16.383 --> 20:19.318
And who exactly is she?

20:22.054 --> 20:24.923
(door bells tinkle)

20:24.957 --> 20:28.260
Buffy... um, Anne,
can I talk to you?

20:28.295 --> 20:30.863
Look, this really isn't
a good time. Can it wait?

20:30.896 --> 20:32.898
Rickie's gone.

20:32.932 --> 20:34.601
I haven't seen him
for more than a day.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.903
I mean, he's never left
for that long.

20:36.935 --> 20:39.271
I think something's...
happened.

20:39.306 --> 20:40.940
Maybe something's happened.

20:40.972 --> 20:42.442
Well, did you
call the police?

20:42.474 --> 20:43.875
(sighs)

20:43.910 --> 20:45.778
Rickie skipped out
on his parole.

20:45.811 --> 20:47.947
Um, they would just cause
more trouble.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.615
(sighs)
I don't know.

20:49.648 --> 20:52.652
Did you... did
you ask around?

20:52.684 --> 20:55.555
Can you help me?

20:55.587 --> 20:57.624
Uh, I-I can't.

20:57.656 --> 21:01.059
But that's who you are
and stuff, right? I mean, you

21:01.093 --> 21:04.797
help people, and, you know...
I can't get into this.
I'm sorry, Lily.

21:04.830 --> 21:07.567
You... you know how to do stuff.

21:07.599 --> 21:10.636
I don't. Not anymore.

21:10.670 --> 21:15.375
But... I don't know what to do.

21:19.178 --> 21:20.846
(phone ringing)

21:20.880 --> 21:24.916
We gave blood lots of times
'cause you get a few bucks.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.318
And they have cookies.

21:26.353 --> 21:28.019
You're a fan of
the sugar rush?

21:28.054 --> 21:29.422
It's nice.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.089
Hi.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.991
You here to
donate blood?
Uh, we're looking for

21:33.025 --> 21:34.461
a friend.
Rickie T.?

21:34.493 --> 21:37.163
We come in sometimes.
Rickie, sure.

21:37.195 --> 21:39.598
Uh, he's not here.
Well, do you know
if he's been in

21:39.632 --> 21:41.000
in the last day or so?

21:41.032 --> 21:42.634
Let me check
the sheet.

21:42.669 --> 21:45.171
MAN:
Ow!

21:45.203 --> 21:48.641
This'll probably go
faster if we split up.

21:48.674 --> 21:50.542
Can I come with you?

21:50.576 --> 21:53.613
Okay, where did I lose you on
the whole splitting up thing?

21:53.645 --> 21:55.647
Oh. Sorry.

21:55.682 --> 21:57.384
BUFFY:
I was thinking
we could check out

21:57.416 --> 21:59.151
some of your hangouts and, um,

21:59.184 --> 22:01.354
I guess, meet
later at my place?

22:01.387 --> 22:03.122
Okay.

22:03.154 --> 22:05.290
WOMAN:
Sorry, guys.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.959
He hasn't been here.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.494
Thanks.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.028
I'll tell him
you were looking.

22:10.061 --> 22:12.432
Great.

22:19.538 --> 22:22.509
(indistinct chatter)

22:30.281 --> 22:32.250
(distant coughing)

22:33.920 --> 22:37.123
(coughing)

22:46.465 --> 22:49.801
(coughing)

23:28.474 --> 23:30.910
Rickie?

23:36.749 --> 23:39.151
(horns honking)

23:45.692 --> 23:47.425
Did you find Rickie?

23:47.460 --> 23:48.994
I thought of...

23:49.028 --> 23:51.096
Well, he likes to go
to this movie house.

23:51.130 --> 23:54.432
You can get in
around the back...
Lily...

23:56.434 --> 23:58.671
I think he's dead.

24:03.643 --> 24:05.411
But...

24:05.443 --> 24:07.680
he takes care of me.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.549
I'm sorry.

24:12.050 --> 24:13.685
We're gonna get a place.

24:13.720 --> 24:16.823
His cousin can get him
a job at the car wash.

24:16.855 --> 24:19.325
Lily, there's...
there's something else.

24:21.560 --> 24:24.931
The-the person that I found...

24:24.963 --> 24:26.432
was old.

24:26.464 --> 24:28.099
He-he looked about 80.

24:28.134 --> 24:30.970
Well, that's not Rickie.
I'm sure it was.

24:33.806 --> 24:37.143
I-I don't know how, but...

24:37.175 --> 24:40.512
it was like something
drained the life out of him.

24:40.547 --> 24:43.148
Do you mean like a vampire?

24:43.182 --> 24:49.454
No. A vampire couldn't
accelerate the aging process.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.624
Maybe it was something
in his blood. Wh...?

24:51.657 --> 24:54.059
When was the last time
you guys gave blood together?

24:54.093 --> 24:56.228
I don't understand.

24:56.261 --> 24:58.329
Maybe it's not
Rickie, okay?
Lily,

24:58.364 --> 25:01.232
this is something you're just
gonna have to deal with.
But he didn't do

25:01.267 --> 25:02.902
anything wrong. Why
would this happen to him?

25:02.934 --> 25:06.305
That's not the point.

25:06.337 --> 25:07.740
These things happen
all the time.

25:07.773 --> 25:09.508
You can't just...
close your eyes

25:09.541 --> 25:12.077
and hope
that they're gonna go away.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.347
Is it cause of you?

25:16.382 --> 25:18.951
What?

25:20.419 --> 25:23.722
You know about...
monsters and stuff.

25:25.257 --> 25:27.292
You could have brought this
with you.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.563
I didn't bring anything with me.

25:30.596 --> 25:33.499
And I didn't ask for you to come
to me with your problems.

25:33.531 --> 25:35.401
I just wanted to be left alone.

25:35.433 --> 25:37.936
If you can't deal,
then don't lay it off on me.

25:47.278 --> 25:48.748
(sighs)

25:48.780 --> 25:51.250
(car horn blaring)

25:56.221 --> 25:58.590
Are you okay?

25:59.826 --> 26:02.595
Hey, it's okay.

26:02.628 --> 26:03.863
Maybe I can help.

26:03.895 --> 26:06.231
(sniffles)

26:06.265 --> 26:09.101
You can't.

26:09.134 --> 26:11.703
Look, I know you all
think I'm a big square

26:11.738 --> 26:15.273
handing out
leaflets about hope,

26:15.307 --> 26:19.144
but hope is a real
thing, just like despair.

26:19.178 --> 26:22.914
And hope can fill up a
part of you that's missing.

26:22.949 --> 26:25.884
But Rickie's...

26:25.917 --> 26:28.554
Rickie?

26:28.586 --> 26:31.990
Say, are you Lily?

26:32.023 --> 26:36.061
Right. Right, he was
talking about you.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.329
You've seen Rickie?

26:38.364 --> 26:40.566
Oh, sure.

26:40.598 --> 26:43.169
Rickie's with us now.

26:43.201 --> 26:45.738
She said he was dead.

26:45.771 --> 26:48.574
Well, someone sure
handed you a tall tale.

26:48.606 --> 26:51.242
Rickie's no more
dead than I am.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.345
Why don't you come
to family home?

26:53.378 --> 26:56.214
We'll get you
taken care of.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.494
(door knob rattling)

27:31.583 --> 27:33.986
Candidate for what?

27:35.554 --> 27:37.323
What are you doing?

27:37.355 --> 27:38.990
Breaking into your office

27:39.025 --> 27:41.027
and going through
your private files.

27:41.059 --> 27:42.528
Candidate for what?

27:42.560 --> 27:44.596
I'm calling the police.

27:47.165 --> 27:49.401
Now you've got a whole
bunch of candidates here.

27:49.434 --> 27:51.738
I wonder if any of them
are missing like Rickie?

27:51.770 --> 27:53.372
Gosh, I bet they are.

27:53.404 --> 27:54.740
You're getting

27:54.773 --> 27:56.142
yourself in a lot of trouble.

27:56.174 --> 27:58.644
I don't want any trouble.

27:58.676 --> 28:01.413
I just want to be alone
and quiet in a room

28:01.446 --> 28:05.151
with a chair and a fireplace
and a tea cozy.

28:05.183 --> 28:08.386
I don't even know what
a tea cozy is, but I want one.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.355
Instead, I keep getting trouble,

28:10.388 --> 28:12.959
which I am more
than willing to share.

28:14.559 --> 28:16.662
What are you doing
with these kids?

28:16.694 --> 28:18.430
Nothing.

28:18.463 --> 28:20.266
I just...

28:20.298 --> 28:23.368
I give him the names
of the healthy ones.

28:25.604 --> 28:28.007
Give them to who?

28:28.039 --> 28:30.576
Well, don't you look nice.

28:30.608 --> 28:32.278
LILY:
I guess.

28:32.310 --> 28:34.445
Well, you don't want
to wear your own outfit

28:34.480 --> 28:36.915
to the cleansing.
It'll get soaked.

28:36.949 --> 28:40.086
A cleansing is like
a baptism, right?

28:40.118 --> 28:41.953
Not quite the same.

28:41.988 --> 28:43.388
Will I see
Rickie after?

28:43.422 --> 28:45.691
Oh, of course.
He's waiting for you.

28:45.723 --> 28:48.126
He's very excited.

28:49.161 --> 28:51.262
(sighs)

28:51.297 --> 28:53.265
Why do I have to be bait?

28:53.298 --> 28:55.433
I'm always bait.

28:55.467 --> 28:57.269
Why can't Willow be bait?

28:57.302 --> 28:59.070
He's already
seen Willow.

28:59.105 --> 29:03.275
And could you complain louder
so that all the vampires leave?

29:03.308 --> 29:04.810
I think this is a good spot.

29:04.844 --> 29:07.346
Is everybody packin'?

29:10.115 --> 29:12.919
Let's do it.

29:12.951 --> 29:15.354
(insects chirping,
bird calling)

29:18.790 --> 29:22.294
I'm doing this for Buffy's sake.
This has nothing to do with you.

29:22.327 --> 29:23.761
Yeah, like I needed
that cleared up.

29:23.796 --> 29:26.397
Go away. This is
my hiding spot.

29:26.432 --> 29:29.300
Where do I hide?
You don't hide.
You're bait.

29:29.335 --> 29:31.069
Go act baity.

29:31.103 --> 29:34.440
What's the plan?
The vampire
attacks you.

29:34.472 --> 29:36.474
And then what?
The vampire
kills you.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.576
We watch, we rejoice.

29:38.609 --> 29:40.445
CORDELIA:
Everything's a joke with you.

29:40.479 --> 29:41.980
XANDER:
No, just our relationship.

29:42.013 --> 29:44.415
What relationship?
Oh, that's right, I forgot.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.419
We actually want to bury that
piece of the past, don't we?

29:47.452 --> 29:53.159
We come to this station
to wash away the past.

29:53.192 --> 29:55.626
Go ahead, kneel.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.329
(sighs)

29:58.364 --> 30:03.035
We let the water
run over the sin,

30:03.068 --> 30:07.439
and the pain
and the uncertainty.

30:07.472 --> 30:09.208
It looks kind
of... dirty.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.843
(laughs)
Yeah.

30:10.876 --> 30:12.510
BUFFY:
You know, I just...

30:12.544 --> 30:15.513
I woke up, and I looked in
the mirror, and I thought,

30:15.547 --> 30:17.983
"Hey, what's with all the sin?"

30:18.017 --> 30:19.986
I need to change.

30:20.019 --> 30:22.221
I'm... I'm dirty.

30:22.253 --> 30:24.155
I'm-I'm bad with the...

30:24.190 --> 30:26.157
sex and the envy

30:26.192 --> 30:30.096
and that-that loud music us kids
listen to nowadays. What...?

30:31.396 --> 30:34.200
Oh, I just suck at undercover.

30:34.232 --> 30:36.567
Where's Ken?

30:36.602 --> 30:39.404
(door thuds open,
man grunts, thudding)

30:53.184 --> 30:55.753
This is a private moment.
If you could just...

30:55.787 --> 30:57.155
How do you make
'em old, Ken?

30:57.189 --> 30:59.490
Do you feed on youth?
What's the deal?

30:59.525 --> 31:02.760
Do you really want to know?

31:02.794 --> 31:04.496
What's going on?

31:04.529 --> 31:07.598
(screaming)

31:08.767 --> 31:11.002
Ooh! No! Ow!

31:11.037 --> 31:13.605
No. No!

31:15.473 --> 31:17.576
(grunting)

31:20.980 --> 31:22.048
Oh.

31:22.080 --> 31:24.049
Lily. Oh!

31:24.083 --> 31:26.352
(groaning)

31:26.384 --> 31:27.752
(groaning):
Oh!

31:27.786 --> 31:30.622
Hey.
Oh.

31:30.655 --> 31:34.726
KEN:
Oh! Face. Ow! My

31:34.759 --> 31:36.295
face.

31:36.327 --> 31:38.730
Do you have any idea

31:38.763 --> 31:42.800
how hard it is
to glue that thing on?

31:44.736 --> 31:48.074
(panting)
Guards!

31:54.145 --> 31:56.182
(metallic clanking)

31:58.849 --> 32:02.421
(clanking, buzzing)

32:09.095 --> 32:11.963
(clanking and buzzing continue,
indistinct chatter)

32:11.998 --> 32:13.398
(blow landing, grunting)

32:13.432 --> 32:15.467
(coughing)

32:15.500 --> 32:17.669
(buzzing)

32:17.702 --> 32:20.771
(clanging, buzzing)

32:25.044 --> 32:27.778
(indistinct shouting)

32:33.986 --> 32:35.921
Welcome to my world.

32:35.953 --> 32:37.990
I hope you like it.
MALE:
Don't stop!

32:38.023 --> 32:40.992
(grunting)

32:41.027 --> 32:43.194
You're never leaving.

32:43.229 --> 32:45.530
(indistinct shouting, clanging)

32:51.369 --> 32:52.938
Let me just ask
you one thing.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.440
How long did it take
for you to forget me?

32:54.472 --> 32:55.941
Were you still taxiing
down the runway,

32:55.973 --> 32:57.608
or was it actually
in the cab?
Oh,

32:57.643 --> 32:59.278
yeah! Mr. Faithful?!

32:59.310 --> 33:02.013
Probably met up with some
hot little Inca mummy girl.

33:02.048 --> 33:03.515
Yeah. I heard about her.

33:03.548 --> 33:05.217
(thudding)

33:05.250 --> 33:07.353
WILLOW (screams)
Help!

33:07.385 --> 33:08.787
(Willow screams,
growling)

33:08.819 --> 33:11.457
(Oz grunting, growling,
Willow screams)

33:11.490 --> 33:12.891
(grunting)

33:12.923 --> 33:15.760
(growling)
(grunting)

33:16.928 --> 33:18.196
(grunting and growling)

33:18.230 --> 33:19.565
Xander!

33:19.597 --> 33:21.567
(growling)

33:21.599 --> 33:22.867
(grunting)

33:22.901 --> 33:24.869
(grunting, growling)

33:35.447 --> 33:39.984
(metallic clanging)

33:40.018 --> 33:42.221
Oh.

33:42.253 --> 33:46.023
(groans)

33:46.057 --> 33:48.259
Uh, Lily?

33:49.760 --> 33:52.498
I always knew I
would come here...

33:52.530 --> 33:55.233
sooner or later.

33:56.968 --> 33:59.238
I knew I
belonged here.

33:59.270 --> 34:01.073
Where?

34:01.106 --> 34:03.174
Hell.

34:03.209 --> 34:05.576
This isn't hell.

34:05.611 --> 34:07.246
Isn't it?

34:07.278 --> 34:08.947
(groans softly)

34:08.980 --> 34:12.550
What is hell
but the total absence of hope?

34:12.583 --> 34:14.353
The substance,

34:14.385 --> 34:17.054
the tactile proof of despair.

34:17.088 --> 34:18.623
You're right, Lily.

34:18.657 --> 34:20.891
This is where you've been
heading all your life.

34:20.925 --> 34:22.360
Just like Rickie.

34:22.393 --> 34:23.728
Rickie?

34:23.762 --> 34:25.864
He forgot you.

34:25.896 --> 34:28.367
Well, it took him a long time.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.469
He remembered your name years
after he'd forgotten his own.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.804
But in the end...

34:33.838 --> 34:35.974
Years? But...

34:36.007 --> 34:38.409
Oh, uh, interesting thing--

34:38.443 --> 34:42.148
time moves more quickly
here than in your reality.

34:42.181 --> 34:44.215
A hundred long years
will pass here.

34:44.250 --> 34:47.385
On Earth, it's just a day.

34:47.418 --> 34:51.989
So you just work us till we're
too old and spit us back out.

34:52.023 --> 34:53.659
That's the plan.

34:53.692 --> 34:55.126
(woman screams in the distance)

34:55.161 --> 34:58.764
See, Lily, you'll die

34:58.797 --> 35:00.398
of old age before anyone

35:00.431 --> 35:02.333
wonders where you went.
Not that anyone will.

35:02.367 --> 35:04.001
That's why we chose you.

35:04.034 --> 35:06.137
You didn't choose me.

35:06.172 --> 35:09.907
No, but... I know you...

35:09.940 --> 35:12.643
Anne. (scoffs)

35:12.677 --> 35:14.280
So afraid.

35:14.313 --> 35:17.648
So pathetically
determined to run away

35:17.682 --> 35:20.686
from whatever it
is you used to be,

35:20.719 --> 35:23.489
to disappear.

35:23.521 --> 35:25.623
Congratulations.

35:27.626 --> 35:30.061
You got your wish.

35:35.233 --> 35:37.835
(man screaming in the distance)
MALE:
Work!

35:37.869 --> 35:41.873
You work, and you live.
That is all.

35:41.907 --> 35:46.844
You do not complain or laugh
or do anything besides work.

35:46.878 --> 35:49.481
(woman screaming)
Whatever you thought,

35:49.514 --> 35:52.217
whatever you were
does not matter.
(door slams shut)

35:52.251 --> 35:54.186
You are no one now.

35:54.219 --> 35:56.387
You mean nothing.

35:59.490 --> 36:01.193
Who are you?

36:01.226 --> 36:02.827
Aaron.

36:02.860 --> 36:05.163
(grunting, blow landing,
thudding)

36:09.268 --> 36:11.068
Who are you?

36:11.101 --> 36:13.204
No one.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.476
Who are you?

36:17.509 --> 36:19.577
MAN:
No one.

36:23.114 --> 36:25.083
Who are you?

36:27.552 --> 36:30.088
I'm Buffy... the Vampire Slayer.
And you are?

36:30.121 --> 36:32.724
(yelling)

36:32.757 --> 36:36.262
(grunting)

36:37.896 --> 36:41.233
Anyone who's not
having fun here, follow me.

36:44.302 --> 36:47.672
(buzzing)

36:47.706 --> 36:50.108
(clanking)

36:59.784 --> 37:01.719
BUFFY:
There's no way
we can get back up there

37:01.753 --> 37:04.356
without meeting new people.

37:04.389 --> 37:09.960
Okay. Lily, when those guards
leave, and they will leave...

37:09.994 --> 37:13.030
I want you to take these people
and get them up there, okay?

37:13.063 --> 37:15.434
Fast and quiet.

37:15.467 --> 37:16.934
You're leaving
me? But...

37:16.967 --> 37:21.072
Lily... you can
handle this...

37:21.106 --> 37:22.307
'cause I say so.

37:22.340 --> 37:24.610
(alarm wailing)

37:24.643 --> 37:28.313
We've gone public.
Okay, get them up. Go! Quiet!

37:28.347 --> 37:30.949
I'm sorry I said this
was your fault before.

37:30.981 --> 37:33.751
Lily, this can wait.
Well, in case
we die...

37:33.784 --> 37:36.054
Go! Go!

37:36.086 --> 37:38.489
(Buffy gasps,
alarm wailing)

37:44.695 --> 37:47.632
(alarm continues)

37:47.666 --> 37:49.166
(indistinct shouting)

37:52.338 --> 37:54.172
(indistinct shouting)

37:54.204 --> 37:55.474
Out of the way!

37:55.507 --> 37:58.643
Oh!
(grunting)

37:59.878 --> 38:03.315
(grunting)

38:07.985 --> 38:09.320
(indistinct shouting)

38:09.355 --> 38:11.989
Come on, come on!
Everybody go! Run!

38:13.291 --> 38:16.862
(grunting)

38:21.400 --> 38:24.835
(grunting, blows landing)

38:27.304 --> 38:29.708
Humans don't fight back.

38:29.740 --> 38:32.610
(grunting)
Humans don't fight back!

38:32.643 --> 38:34.780
(grunting)

38:34.813 --> 38:37.349
That's how this works!

38:37.382 --> 38:41.387
(grunting)

38:46.925 --> 38:49.327
Get down there!

38:59.170 --> 39:02.608
(grunting)

39:20.791 --> 39:26.197
(grunting)

39:27.398 --> 39:31.036
(panting)

39:33.905 --> 39:36.942
(squeals, whimpers)

39:36.974 --> 39:40.311
(grunting)

39:53.458 --> 39:55.860
One of you fights...

39:55.893 --> 39:59.297
and you all die.

40:01.467 --> 40:05.202
That... was not...

40:05.235 --> 40:06.972
permitted.

40:07.005 --> 40:09.074
Yeah, but it was fun.

40:09.106 --> 40:12.643
You've got guts.

40:12.677 --> 40:15.646
I think I'd like to slice
you open and play with them.

40:16.914 --> 40:18.817
Let everyone know--

40:18.849 --> 40:22.454
this is the price of rebellion.

40:22.487 --> 40:24.956
(yelling)

40:24.989 --> 40:27.626
(splat)

40:29.027 --> 40:31.963
(grunting)

40:41.972 --> 40:44.342
(grunts softly)

40:47.144 --> 40:49.347
They'll be coming.
(quiet chatter)

40:49.380 --> 40:51.148
(grunting)

40:51.181 --> 40:52.983
(creaking)

40:53.018 --> 40:55.186
Okay. This works...

40:55.219 --> 40:57.288
the abs... and the glutes.

40:57.322 --> 41:00.826
(groaning)

41:02.059 --> 41:04.496
Go!
I'm gonna

41:04.530 --> 41:06.998
feel this all week.

41:07.032 --> 41:09.367
(yelling, Buffy groans)

41:09.400 --> 41:14.905
(yelling)

41:17.543 --> 41:22.079
Okay, yeah.
You got it. Yeah!

41:27.918 --> 41:29.353
(grunting)

41:29.387 --> 41:34.059
You've... ruined... You...

41:34.092 --> 41:37.528
Hey, Ken, want
to see my impression of Gandhi?

41:37.563 --> 41:38.563
(shallow breathing)

41:38.597 --> 41:41.032
(blow landing)
(yells)

41:43.702 --> 41:45.536
Gandhi?

41:45.570 --> 41:49.074
Well, you know, if he
was really pissed off.

41:54.913 --> 41:57.481
(liquid whooshing)
Ooh!

41:57.514 --> 42:00.418
(panting)

42:00.451 --> 42:02.920
But what do we do about...?

42:02.954 --> 42:07.125
(whooshing)

42:12.931 --> 42:15.900
Let me give you the tour.

42:18.536 --> 42:21.338
This concludes our tour.

42:21.371 --> 42:23.373
It's really nice.

42:23.407 --> 42:27.344
All the rent's paid up
for the next three weeks.

42:27.378 --> 42:31.548
I spoke to Mitch at the diner.

42:33.952 --> 42:36.887
He said you can
start on Thursday.

42:36.922 --> 42:38.690
He's, uh...

42:38.724 --> 42:41.025
He's kind of... repulsive,

42:41.059 --> 42:44.996
but, uh, he won't
give you a hard time.

42:48.833 --> 42:52.938
Um, I'll call
and check up on you.

42:55.974 --> 43:01.146
I'm not... great at taking care
of myself.

43:04.014 --> 43:06.317
Gets easier.

43:06.351 --> 43:09.586
Takes practice.

43:16.994 --> 43:18.463
Hey.

43:21.365 --> 43:23.768
Can I be Anne?

43:32.610 --> 43:34.579
(knocking)

43:34.612 --> 43:37.014
(sighs)

44:04.474 --> 44:06.844
(sighs gently)

44:46.784 --> 44:49.253
Grr. Argh.
