40:10.425 --> 40:11.841
...We are a group of women

traumatized by our friend

practically in front of us.

All of us have warning bells

40:20.469 --> 40:22.102

40:22.137 --> 40:23.269

wanna upset her.

40:23.305 --> 40:25.671
We wanted to stay
in her good graces.

40:25.690 --> 40:29.359
We ignored our instincts.
We ignored messages people said.

40:29.394 --> 40:32.345
We ignored victims of hers.
That is fact.

Ohh.

40:53.051 --> 40:54.868
And I--and it's upsetting me.

40:54.903 --> 40:57.253
My grandmother used to say,
"it's not who says it.

40:57.305 --> 41:00.390
It's who believes it."
you've been there.

41:00.425 --> 41:03.876

"meredith, what religion,

to say about?"

a fair answer.

a totally fair answer.

I trust my friend cameron,

41:19.861 --> 41:22.162

to me about mary's church.

41:22.197 --> 41:23.329
Did he tell you specific things

41:23.365 --> 41:24.631
that she did to him
in the church?

41:24.666 --> 41:27.033
Cameron has had
extreme religious trauma

41:27.068 --> 41:28.535
being a member of mary's church.
-Of mary's church.

And he is no longer
a member of her church.
