WEBVTT

00:00.398 --> 00:01.697
<i>So here's what you missed on Glee:</i>

00:01.783 --> 00:02.750
<i>The New Directions! are headed to Nationals</i>

00:02.784 --> 00:04.051
<i>in beautiful Los Angeles,</i>

00:04.085 --> 00:05.419
<i>and Sue gave Mr. Shue an ultimatum that,</i>

00:05.453 --> 00:07.054
<i>if they don't win, the club is finished.</i>

00:07.088 --> 00:08.642
Michael William Schuster!

00:08.660 --> 00:10.246
<i>But he says he knows a
championship team when he sees one.</i>

00:10.247 --> 00:10.715
You guys are ready.

00:10.716 --> 00:11.652
<i>Although last time I counted,</i>

00:11.668 --> 00:12.623
<i>they don't even have enough members.</i>

00:12.624 --> 00:14.168
<i>They'd better scare up
three band members stat.</i>

00:14.370 --> 00:15.570
<i>Finn lead the Glee Club
to victory last year,</i>

00:15.604 --> 00:16.571
<i>but now they don't have a leader</i>

00:16.605 --> 00:17.539
<i>and they also don't have Rachel.</i>

00:17.573 --> 00:20.038
<i>Or Kurt. Or Santana.
Or Britney. Or Mercedes.</i>

00:20.045 --> 00:21.705
<i>Or Rory, the Irish kid. Where'd he go?</i>

00:21.785 --> 00:22.952
<i>And they're also up against
a performing arts school</i>

00:22.987 --> 00:24.220
<i>where they don't even take classes</i>

00:24.255 --> 00:26.745
<i>and they're all, like,
acrobats and contortionists.</i>

00:26.789 --> 00:28.573
<i>And that's what you missed on Glee.</i>

00:30.596 --> 00:31.703
(school bell ringing)

00:31.803 --> 00:33.237
(humming)

00:34.396 --> 00:36.096
Hey, you wanted to see me?

00:36.176 --> 00:37.977
Yeah. Have a seat.

00:39.479 --> 00:40.779
(clears throat)

00:40.814 --> 00:43.749
Um, I just want to let
you know that even though

00:43.783 --> 00:45.451
I've kind of, like, checked out of school

00:45.485 --> 00:46.685
since I'm not going to college,

00:46.720 --> 00:48.320
I'm totally committed
to Glee Club, you know.

00:48.355 --> 00:50.289
I've had Artie and Blaine
drilling me, like, nonstop

00:50.323 --> 00:52.124
on the rights and lefts
of the choreography,

00:52.158 --> 00:54.627
and I've recruited three hot
Cheerios! to get us to 12...

00:54.661 --> 00:57.696
You don't have to prove
yourself to me, Sam.

00:57.731 --> 01:00.366
Finn transformed this
club when he joined up.

01:00.400 --> 01:02.001
He wasn't just a male lead,

01:02.035 --> 01:03.836
he was the captain of the football team.

01:03.870 --> 01:05.538
He was the coolest kid in school.

01:05.572 --> 01:07.206
I mean, a real dude, you know?

01:07.240 --> 01:10.209
He was our secret weapon
at those competitions.

01:10.243 --> 01:12.378
Other schools might have
had their version of a Rachel

01:12.412 --> 01:14.547
or a Kurt, but no one had a Finn.

01:14.581 --> 01:16.549
Yeah, he... he made it seem pretty cool.

01:16.583 --> 01:17.883
When he recruited you,

01:17.918 --> 01:19.985
he wasn't just looking
for another voice in here.

01:20.020 --> 01:21.687
He was looking for someone

01:21.721 --> 01:23.889
to take his place after he graduated.

01:23.924 --> 01:27.860
Someone to help lead all
of these wonderful misfits.

01:27.894 --> 01:30.029
I'm not Finn, Mr. Shue.

01:31.231 --> 01:32.831
Finn was, like, a real leader, you know?

01:32.866 --> 01:34.934
And so are you.

01:34.968 --> 01:38.237
And I'm gonna need you to be
that guy when we get to L.A.

01:38.271 --> 01:40.172
The kids want you to be that guy.

01:40.207 --> 01:41.215
They're all waiting for you to see yourself

01:41.218 --> 01:43.375
the way they see you.

01:43.410 --> 01:45.878
The new kids love you,
and so do the older ones.

01:45.912 --> 01:49.348
I'm sure that everything is
gonna be fine once we get there.

01:49.382 --> 01:52.117
But if the time comes,

01:52.152 --> 01:53.719
and you need to step up,

01:53.753 --> 01:57.056
I'm gonna be counting
on you to get it done.

01:58.658 --> 01:59.725
They're here.

02:00.760 --> 02:01.894
Hey, guys.

02:01.928 --> 02:03.195
Good morning.

02:04.497 --> 02:06.632
How's it going, man?

02:06.666 --> 02:08.366
We just wanted to come in and say

02:08.401 --> 02:11.904
that, uh, Finn really cared about you guys.

02:11.938 --> 02:13.272
More than you know.

02:13.306 --> 02:15.674
Finn always said that winning nationals

02:15.709 --> 02:18.544
was the greatest
accomplishment of his life.

02:18.578 --> 02:22.314
But I honestly believe
that coaching you guys

02:22.349 --> 02:24.283
to winning would have
meant even more to him.

02:24.317 --> 02:26.418
BURT: Now, now we're not saying

02:26.453 --> 02:28.521
go out there and win it for Finn.

02:28.555 --> 02:30.256
That wasn't his style.

02:31.157 --> 02:35.461
Um, what Finn would have said was

02:35.495 --> 02:39.598
this is the time of your lives right now.

02:39.633 --> 02:42.735
You're never gonna forget it,

02:42.769 --> 02:45.504
and in a moment, it's all gonna be over.

02:45.539 --> 02:47.806
So no sad faces.

02:47.841 --> 02:49.742
No regrets.

02:49.776 --> 02:51.877
Just go out there and have a blast,

02:51.912 --> 02:55.114
and, you know, it'll be okay
if you won the damn thing.

02:55.148 --> 02:56.482
(laughter)

02:56.516 --> 02:58.417
And the best part about
it is that Burt and Carole

02:58.451 --> 03:00.452
have agreed to come with us as chaperones.

03:00.487 --> 03:03.689
(cheering)

03:03.723 --> 03:06.859
But I think before we go,
we need a little mood music

03:06.893 --> 03:07.927
to send us off.

03:07.961 --> 03:09.028
Brad?

Don't look now, but I think
someone famous just came in!

05:14.154 --> 05:17.356
Even better! It's Mercedes Jones!

05:17.390 --> 05:18.657
I was hoping you'd make it!

05:18.692 --> 05:20.459
Are you crazy? I wouldn't
miss this for the world.

05:20.494 --> 05:22.328
Ooh, I heard that you got a record contract

05:22.362 --> 05:23.729
because either Usher, Kelly Clarkson

05:23.763 --> 05:25.664
or Michael Jackson's daddy

05:25.699 --> 05:29.101
bought your album in
a 7-Eleven parking lot.

05:29.135 --> 05:31.637
<i>MERCEDES: I was selling my CD
Hell 2 the No in a parking lot.</i>

05:31.671 --> 05:34.640
<i>Now, I ain't gonna lie, business was wack.</i>

05:34.674 --> 05:37.009
<i>But then this Mexican lady bought one.</i>

05:37.043 --> 05:38.777
<i>I think she felt sorry for me.</i>

05:38.812 --> 05:41.914
<i>Turns out, that Mexican angel
on earth was the housekeeper</i>

05:41.948 --> 05:42.915
<i>to Kanye West.</i>

05:42.949 --> 05:44.550
<i>She gave it to Kanye,</i>

05:44.584 --> 05:47.052
<i>who gave it to Kim, and she
gave it to Ryan Seacrest,</i>

05:47.087 --> 05:50.623
<i>who gave it to Sony
Records... the Sony Records.</i>

<i>Next thing I know, I'm sipping Perrier</i>

05:52.225 --> 05:53.452

05:53.452 --> 05:54.885
All right, I like this plan,

05:54.920 --> 05:56.854
and I love that you guys like my songs.

05:56.888 --> 05:59.156
So, yes, I'll write for
the artists on your label.

05:59.191 --> 06:01.358
But there is a catch, so listen up.

06:01.393 --> 06:03.961
In exchange for six songs,
I want my own album deal.

06:03.995 --> 06:07.098
And I'm talking all the perks,
all the P&A that you can muster

06:07.132 --> 06:08.999
and two music videos that you pay for.

06:09.034 --> 06:10.401
And if it sells,

06:10.435 --> 06:13.237
I don't have to do a lame
follow-up Christmas album.

06:13.271 --> 06:15.072
Hold up.

06:15.107 --> 06:16.173
Is that dog alive?

06:16.208 --> 06:18.042
Oh, it's a faux-huahua.

06:18.076 --> 06:19.577
A fake Chihuahua.

06:19.611 --> 06:20.578
(laughs)

06:20.612 --> 06:22.146
Mr. Shue, Mercedes is here!

06:22.225 --> 06:23.926
- Oh, hey, Mercedes.
- Hi!

06:23.960 --> 06:26.128
I'd like to speak to a manager, please.

06:26.163 --> 06:27.463
What seems to be the problem here?

06:27.497 --> 06:28.998
WOMAN: Well, one hour ago,

06:29.032 --> 06:32.434
I got a call from Detective Sue Sylvester

06:32.469 --> 06:35.337
with the LAPD saying that
a 50-year-old Ohio man

06:35.372 --> 06:39.675
with a perm had abducted 12
emotionally disturbed teenagers,

06:39.709 --> 06:41.944
and if he tried to make a reservation,

06:41.978 --> 06:43.479
I was to contact the FBI.

06:44.848 --> 06:46.982
Oh, my God, that's them.

06:47.017 --> 06:49.151
Who?

06:49.186 --> 06:51.287
Do you seriously have no idea who that is?

06:51.321 --> 06:53.189
Do none of you read the show choir blogs?

06:53.223 --> 06:54.323
No, Blaine, we don't.

06:54.357 --> 06:56.659
None of us read the show
choir blogs. Just you.

06:56.693 --> 06:58.127
That's Throat Explosion.

06:58.161 --> 07:01.297
And that's their leader, Jean-Baptiste.

07:02.866 --> 07:05.067
Jean-Baptiste was born in
Quebec to acrobatic parents.

07:05.101 --> 07:07.736
He trained with Cirque du Soleil
before emigrating to Ft. Wayne

07:07.771 --> 07:09.338
where he used his
French-Canadian circus stylings

07:09.372 --> 07:11.307
to turn the entire show
choir world upside down.

07:11.341 --> 07:13.242
Bonjour !

07:13.276 --> 07:15.211
You must be the New Directions.

07:15.245 --> 07:18.180
And you... must be Blaine.

07:18.215 --> 07:21.283
How did you know my name?

07:21.318 --> 07:23.018
Show choir blogs.

07:23.053 --> 07:24.720
I'm, you know, I'm Sam Evans,

07:24.754 --> 07:26.522
and I'm the leader of the New Directions.

07:26.556 --> 07:29.225
And, you know, I know you guys
are all really good and stuff,

07:29.259 --> 07:31.527
but that's just gonna get
us out of our comfort zones

07:31.561 --> 07:32.761
and send us over the top.

07:32.796 --> 07:35.397
Well, it was really great to meet you, Sam.

07:35.432 --> 07:36.866
Best of luck, New Directions.

07:36.900 --> 07:39.869
We really can't wait to see your set.

07:39.903 --> 07:42.304
And crush you like a bug.

07:43.540 --> 07:44.573
Bye!

07:45.776 --> 07:46.976
Excuse me.

07:47.010 --> 07:48.577
What is with the turtlenecks?

07:52.349 --> 07:53.716
That was tense.

07:53.750 --> 07:58.053
Oh, I wouldn't miss this
show choir high school drama.

07:58.088 --> 08:00.189
Come on, tell me all about it. Let's go.

08:00.223 --> 08:02.324
Like a bug. That was good.
He was right here in my face.

08:02.359 --> 08:03.426
Why didn't I think of that?

08:03.460 --> 08:04.527
He smells like a winner.

08:12.269 --> 08:14.136
MAN (on TV): Another golden day
of sunshine here in Los Angeles.

08:14.171 --> 08:17.339
Hey, Marley, it's Ryder.
Can I come in for a minute?

08:21.011 --> 08:22.545
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:22.579 --> 08:24.547
Can I talk to you?

08:24.581 --> 08:26.382
- You can come in.
- Okay.

08:29.152 --> 08:32.554
Look, you and me are
probably never gonna happen.

08:32.589 --> 08:35.624
And... like, I'm slowly accepting that.

08:35.659 --> 08:38.394
But that doesn't mean
I don't care about you.

08:38.428 --> 08:40.029
Or that I don't occasionally look

08:40.063 --> 08:41.931
at your Facebook page to check your status.

08:41.965 --> 08:43.765
Single, and it's going to stay that way.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.601
Talking about where you
put what your job is.

08:45.635 --> 08:47.403
It used to say, "Singer/Songwriter,"

08:47.437 --> 08:49.071
now it just says "Undecided."

08:51.074 --> 08:54.777
I entered my songs into this contest.

08:54.811 --> 08:56.479
And you lost?

08:56.513 --> 08:59.882
Worse. I didn't hear back at all.

09:00.917 --> 09:02.251
And I took that as...

09:02.285 --> 09:03.753
I don't know... a wake-up call.

09:03.787 --> 09:05.788
Oh, come on. That's only one contest.

09:05.822 --> 09:09.592
Actually, I've entered a
bunch of contests, Ryder.

09:09.626 --> 09:12.828
Anyway, what's so wrong
with joining Accounting Club

09:12.863 --> 09:14.096
when we get back?

09:14.131 --> 09:16.031
(chuckles) Uh...

09:16.066 --> 09:17.399
I'll tell you one thing.

09:17.434 --> 09:19.702
I think, uh, Accounting Club
interferes with Glee Club.

09:21.571 --> 09:23.506
Marley, are you planning
on quitting Glee Club?

09:26.977 --> 09:29.078
I didn't want to let anyone down.

09:30.981 --> 09:33.816
And since this is going to be my swan song,

09:33.850 --> 09:35.651
I just want it to be fun.

09:35.685 --> 09:37.820
So, please, don't tell anyone.

09:41.625 --> 09:44.193
Are you sure we should be doing this?

09:44.227 --> 09:45.554
I mean, if we get caught...

09:45.564 --> 09:46.564
Oh, just go!

09:46.598 --> 09:48.332
Trust me, when I was in the Warblers,

09:48.367 --> 09:50.501
sneaking onto stage the night
before a show was tradition.

09:50.535 --> 09:52.837
We had other traditions, but
I can't really speak of them.

09:52.871 --> 09:54.171
We're not doing anything wrong.

09:54.206 --> 09:55.706
We're just, you know, getting a feel

09:55.741 --> 09:57.441
for the layout of the stage... our stage.

09:57.476 --> 09:59.777
So should we sing a song or hold hands

09:59.811 --> 10:01.212
or say a prayer or something?

10:01.246 --> 10:02.413
Because if I'm being honest,

10:02.447 --> 10:04.115
this ghost light's kind of freaking me out.

10:04.149 --> 10:06.250
All right, everybody,
circle up. I have a surprise.

10:09.254 --> 10:13.324
Finn Hudson made us a promise
at the beginning of the year:

10:13.358 --> 10:16.794
that we were all going
back to nationals together.

10:16.828 --> 10:18.629
Even when we lost sectionals,

10:18.663 --> 10:21.999
which was totally not Marley's fault,

10:22.034 --> 10:23.801
Finn told us that it wasn't over.

10:23.835 --> 10:27.605
He said that we'd be right here, together.

10:27.639 --> 10:32.043
Now, maybe you're
thinking, "Finn isn't here."

10:37.883 --> 10:40.418
Well, he is.

10:40.452 --> 10:43.020
I made sure of it.

10:43.055 --> 10:44.588
JEAN-BAPTISTE: Well, well!

10:44.623 --> 10:47.525
Les Directions Nouveau !

10:47.559 --> 10:49.460
Uh, apparently, we had the same plan

10:49.494 --> 10:51.696
for an illegal midnight rehearsal.

10:51.730 --> 10:52.463
"We?" You're alone.

10:52.497 --> 10:53.731
Am I?

10:53.765 --> 10:56.100
Existentially, yes, Blaine.

10:56.134 --> 10:57.301
Perhaps.

10:57.336 --> 10:58.402
We are all alone.

10:58.437 --> 11:00.571
But tonight, tonight,

11:00.605 --> 11:03.040
this stage belongs to us

11:03.075 --> 11:05.142
from midnight until dawn.

11:05.177 --> 11:07.545
You see, I called in a
few show choir favors.

11:07.579 --> 11:09.313
So, we'll just give you three minutes

11:09.348 --> 11:11.582
to gather your feelings and leave.

11:11.616 --> 11:12.783
Who is that?

11:13.685 --> 11:14.452
Your spirit guide?

11:14.486 --> 11:15.953
Dolph, enough.

11:15.987 --> 11:17.555
Have some respect.

11:20.792 --> 11:23.361
Look, everyone knows
you're that show choir.

11:23.395 --> 11:25.997
And everyone knows it's been
a very rough year for you.

11:26.031 --> 11:29.867
And now everyone is just waiting

11:29.901 --> 11:33.237
and watching... you.

11:33.271 --> 11:36.273
Tonight, you have our
condolences, New Directions.

11:36.308 --> 11:38.442
But let's just be very, very clear.

11:38.477 --> 11:40.678
Tomorrow, you will not have

11:40.712 --> 11:42.913
our mercy, pity or restraint.

11:43.782 --> 11:46.050
We are Throat Explosion.

11:46.084 --> 11:48.085
Expect us!

11:51.223 --> 11:52.189
Seven, eight!

11:52.224 --> 11:54.225
(feet stomping rhythmically)

12:03.359 --> 12:05.327
- How'd you learn to do that?
- Have you met my son Kurt?

12:05.361 --> 12:07.262
I cannot believe this
is our last competition.

12:07.296 --> 12:08.697
I am not ready for this to end.

12:08.731 --> 12:09.831
Do not start crying again.

12:09.866 --> 12:11.333
I'm not gonna cry.

12:11.367 --> 12:13.535
It's just that some of
my best memories from Glee

12:13.569 --> 12:15.303
- are these competitions.
- BURT: Yeah, well, you know what?

12:15.338 --> 12:17.105
That's why guys love
playing sports so much.

12:17.140 --> 12:19.107
It's not so much about
the winning and the losing.

12:19.142 --> 12:20.575
It's about going to war with your buddies.

12:20.610 --> 12:21.877
You know? The camaraderie.

12:21.911 --> 12:23.512
That's right. That's why you see a bunch

12:23.546 --> 12:25.280
of 50-year-old men humping
around a softball field

12:25.314 --> 12:26.715
or playing flag football.

12:26.749 --> 12:27.883
They're trying to recreate that feeling

12:27.917 --> 12:28.950
they're never gonna get back.

12:28.985 --> 12:29.985
Oh, my God, yes!

12:30.019 --> 12:31.219
That's it. Ugh.

12:31.254 --> 12:32.954
It's so depressing.

12:32.989 --> 12:34.823
I can't believe this
is our last competition.

12:34.857 --> 12:36.992
My life's gonna be so empty from now on.

12:37.026 --> 12:38.593
At least you get to have one.

12:42.065 --> 12:43.865
Oh, my God. I can't believe I said that.

12:43.900 --> 12:45.033
I am so sorry.

12:45.068 --> 12:46.068
No. It's okay.

12:46.102 --> 12:47.069
I'm sorry.

12:47.103 --> 12:48.470
That was totally insensitive of me.

12:48.504 --> 12:50.639
- Tina always does this.
- No, no, no.

12:50.673 --> 12:52.507
It's fine, honey, really.
You didn't do anything wrong.

12:52.542 --> 12:54.076
BURT: You know what,
guys? Why don't you go?

12:54.110 --> 12:56.078
And, uh, you go practice or something,

12:56.112 --> 12:58.080
and I'll have Carole finish up the sewing,

12:58.114 --> 13:01.350
and I'll drop the dress by your room, okay?

13:01.384 --> 13:03.051
Relax.

13:03.086 --> 13:04.987
No eating anything from
the minibar; it's expensive.

13:05.021 --> 13:07.589
If you want something,
go down to the 7-Eleven.

13:07.623 --> 13:08.924
(door closes)

13:12.395 --> 13:14.162
You okay?

13:14.197 --> 13:15.931
I don't think I can do this.

13:17.133 --> 13:18.333
I really wanted to.

13:18.368 --> 13:20.736
But being around all his friends just...

13:20.770 --> 13:22.204
I thought it would make me feel

13:22.238 --> 13:24.072
close to him.

13:24.107 --> 13:26.875
And I know this is awful to say, but...

13:26.909 --> 13:30.078
every time that they laugh
or smile or skip away,

13:30.173 --> 13:33.075
I just feel like my insides
are being ripped out.

13:33.109 --> 13:34.443
Well, we don't have to stay.

13:34.477 --> 13:36.011
Schuester can handle things on his own.

13:36.045 --> 13:37.846
Tina's right though, you know?

13:38.005 --> 13:40.807
When those kids leave McKinley,

13:40.842 --> 13:44.578
it'll be like the last of him leaving, too.

13:44.612 --> 13:46.580
Yeah.

13:46.614 --> 13:48.281
It'll really be over.

13:48.316 --> 13:51.551
I spend the days pretending
that it's not real.

13:51.586 --> 13:55.155
But being around all of them...

13:55.189 --> 13:57.157
I can't pretend.

13:57.191 --> 13:59.259
Is that a bad thing?

14:01.496 --> 14:03.463
Whatever you need.

14:03.498 --> 14:05.966
We can get a room at the Montage.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.534
Drive down to Laguna Beach.

14:07.568 --> 14:09.402
I know how much you loved that show

14:09.437 --> 14:11.671
- when it was on.
- (chuckles) I did.

14:11.706 --> 14:13.640
Or we can fly home.

14:13.674 --> 14:14.808
Whatever you want.

14:14.842 --> 14:16.843
Okay.

14:21.448 --> 14:22.548
Dude, come on. Get dressed.

14:22.582 --> 14:24.417
We got to be down there in 15 minutes.

14:24.451 --> 14:25.885
So, you're talking to me now?

14:25.919 --> 14:29.956
I just don't feel like losing
nationals because of you.

14:33.193 --> 14:35.161
You barely even waited
until the body was cold

14:35.195 --> 14:37.229
before you moved in on Marley.

14:37.264 --> 14:38.931
Not cool.

14:38.966 --> 14:40.800
I screwed up; I get that.

14:40.834 --> 14:42.835
But you didn't even give me
a chance to apologize to her.

14:42.869 --> 14:45.171
Or try and work things out.

14:45.205 --> 14:46.439
I thought we were friends.

14:46.473 --> 14:49.008
We were.

14:49.042 --> 14:51.877
I mean... we are.

14:52.946 --> 14:54.180
At least, we should be.

14:56.049 --> 14:57.516
All right, don't cry.

14:57.551 --> 14:59.719
I'm going, I'm going.

14:59.753 --> 15:01.621
Listen, man, I'm not
supposed to say anything,

15:01.655 --> 15:04.090
but, uh, Marley's quitting
Glee Club when we get back.

15:04.124 --> 15:05.224
Why?

15:05.284 --> 15:07.718
She sent her songs out
to some stupid contests

15:07.753 --> 15:09.454
and never heard back, so now she thinks

15:09.488 --> 15:12.123
it's the universe trying to
tell her to give it all up.

15:12.157 --> 15:14.625
(sighs) That's crazy.

15:14.660 --> 15:16.761
She sent me a few of her songs
though, and they're awesome.

15:16.795 --> 15:18.763
I was thinking if we could find someone

15:18.797 --> 15:20.998
out here in L.A., you know,
someone... someone real

15:21.033 --> 15:22.366
who could tell her they're good.

15:22.401 --> 15:24.469
Sure, I got CeeLo on speed dial.

15:24.503 --> 15:26.237
No, I know I don't know anybody famous,

15:26.271 --> 15:29.340
but we do know someone almost famous.

15:38.250 --> 15:40.685
- What's wrong?
- Finn's plaque... it's missing.

15:40.719 --> 15:41.719
Don't panic. I'm sure it's here somewhere.

15:41.754 --> 15:43.221
It's not in here. I put it right here.

15:43.255 --> 15:44.589
It's gone.

15:44.623 --> 15:45.890
It's probably just...

15:45.924 --> 15:48.159
(Jean-Baptiste chattering)

15:48.193 --> 15:49.160
It's obviously a really big deal to them.

15:49.194 --> 15:50.495
Give it back!

15:50.529 --> 15:52.130
Give what back? Your talent?

15:52.164 --> 15:54.665
Because you obviously left that in Ohio.

15:54.700 --> 15:56.567
All right, just give us the plaque back.

15:56.602 --> 15:58.002
Gentlemen, let's get serious.

15:58.036 --> 15:59.704
You've got zero chance of winning.

15:59.738 --> 16:01.406
You lost your sectionals.

16:01.465 --> 16:02.999
So you're only here on a technicality.

16:03.033 --> 16:05.768
And everyone knows all your
decent singers graduated.

16:05.803 --> 16:06.903
And a little piece of wood with a picture

16:06.937 --> 16:08.438
of a guy on it isn't gonna change...

16:08.472 --> 16:10.173
You're a tool, man! Come on!

16:10.207 --> 16:11.607
Okay, break a leg.

16:11.642 --> 16:14.477
Sam, just... just let it go.

16:14.511 --> 16:16.079
They're just trying to psych
us out; they're being idiots.

16:16.113 --> 16:19.849
We got to get our game faces
on and win this thing, okay?

16:22.820 --> 16:25.621
Okay, guys, look. The
plaque doesn't matter.

16:25.656 --> 16:26.989
You know why?

16:27.024 --> 16:29.459
Because I believe with all
my heart that Finn is here.

16:29.493 --> 16:31.561
He's right here with us, right now.

16:31.595 --> 16:33.863
And he's holding all our
hands, and he's telling us,

16:33.897 --> 16:35.765
"The show must go all over the place."

16:35.799 --> 16:37.266
And when we're up there onstage,

16:37.301 --> 16:39.869
he's gonna be sitting right
next to Mr. Shue cheering us on.

16:39.903 --> 16:42.672
And when we win our
second nationals trophy,

16:42.706 --> 16:44.474
he's gonna be cheering us on even louder.

16:44.508 --> 16:45.641
All right?

16:45.676 --> 16:46.442
So let's do this! Let's go!

16:46.477 --> 16:49.045
Yeah! (all cheering)

16:49.079 --> 16:50.146
Let's go!

16:50.180 --> 16:51.180
(whooping, cheering)

16:51.215 --> 16:52.115
Let's do this.

16:56.364 --> 16:58.031
ANNOUNCER: A reminder
from the City of Angels!

16:58.066 --> 17:00.434
The 405 Freeway is closed
for repairs this month.

17:00.468 --> 17:01.835
Also the subways isn't working

17:01.870 --> 17:04.304
and bus service has been
canceled due to snipers.

17:04.339 --> 17:06.607
Also if you try to walk,
people will look at you weird.

17:06.641 --> 17:07.608
Hi, guys.

17:07.642 --> 17:09.977
Also watch out for terrorists.

17:10.011 --> 17:11.878
And now let's meet our judges!

17:11.913 --> 17:16.049
Please welcome living legend
and Academy Award winner,

17:16.084 --> 17:17.416
Miss Marlee Matlin!

17:17.452 --> 17:18.886
(crowd cheering)

17:18.920 --> 17:20.319
Give a warm hand

17:20.355 --> 17:22.122
for entertainment icon
and Emmy Award winner,

17:22.156 --> 17:24.023
Jackée!

17:24.058 --> 17:25.125
(crowd cheering)

17:25.159 --> 17:28.194
But you all can just call me Jackée.

17:28.229 --> 17:29.997
(cheering continues)

17:30.051 --> 17:32.486
A round of applause for the
inventor of the fitness craze

17:32.520 --> 17:34.555
that's sweeping the nation, Prancercise,

17:34.589 --> 17:36.557
Joanna Rohrback!

17:36.591 --> 17:38.592
(crowd cheering)

17:49.904 --> 17:52.139
And now from Oklahoma City,

17:52.173 --> 17:54.208

Three minutes.

Sorry?

32:42.256 --> 32:45.658
The next time one of
your songs gets rejected,

32:45.693 --> 32:48.428
you can throw yourself a pity
party for exactly three minutes.

32:48.462 --> 32:50.463

32:50.497 --> 32:51.698

They're stupid and they're wrong,

32:59.406 --> 33:00.740

36:46.112 --> 36:48.680
didn't have the best
voice or the best rhythm

great disappointment to know

I bet you're hoping for
a last-minute reprieve

39:08.154 --> 39:11.456
and that I'll say something
about how your plucky band

39:11.490 --> 39:15.260
of pinhead minstrels overcame
so much to get where they did

39:15.294 --> 39:19.464
and how second place is
actually an achievement.

39:19.498 --> 39:22.701
I... I can't say I wasn't secretly
hoping you would consider it.

39:22.735 --> 39:24.202
I have considered it.

39:24.237 --> 39:26.171
More than you know.

39:26.205 --> 39:27.939
But I just can't.

39:27.974 --> 39:30.775
In the words of ex-Principal Figgins,

39:30.810 --> 39:33.111
my hands are tied.

39:34.313 --> 39:36.281
I'm the principal now, William,

39:36.315 --> 39:39.084
and my job is concerned with
the health of the entire school,

39:39.118 --> 39:41.019
not just the fiefdoms that I like.

39:41.053 --> 39:42.687
And I do like you, William.

39:42.722 --> 39:44.856
That's why I'm so mean to you.

39:45.758 --> 39:47.325
That being said,

39:47.360 --> 39:50.195
the Cheerios! stay because they won.

39:50.229 --> 39:52.197
So does the debate team, the football team,

39:52.231 --> 39:53.732
the girls soccer team

39:53.766 --> 39:55.200
and mock U.N.

39:55.234 --> 39:57.102
However, diving,

39:57.136 --> 39:59.938
academic decathlon, actual decathlon

39:59.972 --> 40:03.808

40:08.347 --> 40:10.295

40:10.304 --> 40:13.740
Sh... should I make a
speech about the arts or...

40:13.819 --> 40:16.588
or how much this club
means to me personally?

40:16.622 --> 40:17.589
No, no.

40:17.623 --> 40:19.057
Save that for your wife.

40:19.091 --> 40:21.393
It'd probably turn her on.

40:21.517 --> 40:24.552
That won't make any difference here.

40:24.587 --> 40:26.287
So this is really it.

40:28.357 --> 40:29.691
What's gonna happen to the choir room?

40:29.725 --> 40:30.959
Well, it's prime real estate.

40:30.993 --> 40:33.628
I'll probably turn it into two classrooms.

40:33.663 --> 40:36.965
And since we won't be
needing the band anymore

40:36.999 --> 40:39.467
to play everything from obscure Broadway

40:39.502 --> 40:41.403
to Queen at a moment's notice,

40:41.437 --> 40:43.004
probably sell off their equipment

40:43.039 --> 40:44.773
and buy some computers.

40:46.342 --> 40:48.176
Butt chin up, Schuester.

40:48.210 --> 40:49.778
Look where you were

40:49.812 --> 40:52.380
four years ago when you started this thing.

40:52.415 --> 40:54.382
You've got a national championship trophy

40:54.417 --> 40:56.051
from last year in that case

40:56.085 --> 40:58.687
and a bunch of other loser
trophies standing with it.

40:58.721 --> 41:01.489
You and your team have
done phenomenally well,

41:01.524 --> 41:04.292
and you did it with the
world's greatest nemesis

41:04.327 --> 41:06.361
playing her best game against you.

41:08.097 --> 41:10.065
You didn't lose, William.

41:12.101 --> 41:14.536
The game is just over.

41:27.616 --> 41:29.718

the choir room into a
computer lab or something.
