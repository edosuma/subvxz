-Your mum's been on the phone.
-Yeah?

18:40.203 --> 18:42.288
Wants you to put me
away again, does she?

18:42.372 --> 18:43.957
She was talking me out of it.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.042
Seems she doesn't think
it was doing you any good.

18:46.876 --> 18:48.962
I'm sure she's right.

18:49.045 --> 18:51.214
Like you've ever paid
attention to what Mum thinks.

18:51.297 --> 18:55.760
Well, at the end of the day,
you're family.

18:55.844 --> 18:58.013
-No, I don't want that.
-Take it.

18:58.096 --> 18:59.806
You'll be gone
before we know it.

19:01.099 --> 19:04.352

any funny voices
in your head...

19:04.436 --> 19:06.104

postcards any more.

21:54.689 --> 21:55.899
Right.

21:57.275 --> 22:00.320
-So, you're not working today?
-No.

22:00.403 --> 22:02.322
-I'm between

-Oh.

22:02.405 --> 22:04.324
-Lucky you.
-Mmm.

22:06.242 --> 22:08.661
So, what's the problem?

22:08.745 --> 22:12.999

22:15.377 --> 22:17.962

my mind when I was signing
the contract.

you an arm and a leg

-So, are you planning on...
-Yeah, I'll be gone soon.
Don't worry.

22:29.599 --> 22:32.352
Oh, no...
I don't mind you staying.

to help me keep an eye on her.

Ryan's too keen on the idea,
to be honest.

on the day?

the day together.
It's easier that way.

-That smells good.
-I hope so.

in this place?

-Well, you know Kate's
granddad ran the asylum?
-Yeah.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.249
And that they shut them down.

27:06.167 --> 27:08.545
-Abuse of patients.
-What, Kate's granddad?

gone on for years.

-Did he go down for it?
-Nope.

27:13.091 --> 27:15.719
He died before
they could get him to court.

would they come back?

-I'll be after you

So, Mol, tell me.
How did the job interview go?

27:29.357 --> 27:31.317
I turned up. That's about it.

27:31.401 --> 27:34.320

you thinking of going
travelling, did you?

putting it out there?

28:01.598 --> 28:04.851
-You brought it up.
-It's just, you've fallen
on your feet here.

28:04.934 --> 28:07.604

Why would you want to leave?

who you might bump into

for once, not to have to
pick up the pieces afterwards.

28:26.039 --> 28:28.416

-Have you seen her?

No, I was just wondering if
she fancied going for a drink.
It's been one of those days.

28:51.272 --> 28:53.400
What, has she not been
in touch, text or anything?

28:53.483 --> 28:55.735
No. Have you not
heard from her?

28:55.819 --> 28:58.279
No, not since
yesterday evening.

28:58.363 --> 29:00.615
She said she was going
into town with someone.

29:00.699 --> 29:03.326
Yeah, me. We were
waiting for my flatmate.

29:03.410 --> 29:06.830
Right. And did she talk about
how the rent was due today?

29:06.913 --> 29:09.249
-Do you think she's okay?
-You know what I think?

29:09.332 --> 29:11.626
I think she's done a runner
before I could chuck her out.

29:11.710 --> 29:14.587

if I hear anything...

the night had ended badly.

It's like
she just disappeared.

She's only been away
for one night.

I left her outside.
Said I'd only be a minute.

on someone's floor.

she was being watched.

40:50.950 --> 40:52.118
You just want this, don't you?

40:55.246 --> 40:57.957
We didn't take it from you.

40:58.041 --> 41:00.669
No one's keeping you here.
You're free.

41:02.295 --> 41:03.963
You can go now.

41:18.019 --> 41:19.396
Kate, come on.

41:32.242 --> 41:34.369
-It's all right.

41:37.997 --> 41:39.249
You're okay.

41:46.423 --> 41:48.758
You mustn't fall asleep
in the water.

41:52.554 --> 41:54.139
JED: It's okay.

(DOOR OPENS)

41:58.643 --> 42:01.438
Kate, what happened?

42:04.482 --> 42:06.776
Oh, come here.

42:06.860 --> 42:09.738
(SHUSHES)
It's okay. You're okay.

42:09.821 --> 42:11.531
You were talking to someone.

42:12.532 --> 42:14.409
But I couldn't see anyone.

42:16.411 --> 42:18.663
She was a patient.

42:18.747 --> 42:21.416
They ducked her underwater
to drive out evil spirits.

42:21.499 --> 42:22.709
What was wrong with her?

42:22.792 --> 42:24.961
Probably fancied someone
she shouldn't,

42:25.045 --> 42:26.379
and her husband
got her put away.

42:27.672 --> 42:29.257
What did you mean about...
You said...

42:29.341 --> 42:30.717
I don't just see ghosts, Ryan.

42:32.010 --> 42:33.178
I see how they died.

42:35.972 --> 42:38.141
How did you know
I was in trouble?

42:40.185 --> 42:41.519
Jed...

42:43.855 --> 42:44.898
Stay.

42:46.358 --> 42:47.692
I know you don't want to go.

42:49.652 --> 42:51.654
I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

42:53.990 --> 42:55.492
And I guess you are.

42:57.285 --> 42:58.453
Am I?
