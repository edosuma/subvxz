00:01.784 --> 00:04.613
<i>My name is Kara Zor-El,
I'm from Krypton.</i>

00:04.656 --> 00:07.224
<i>I'm a refugee on this planet.</i>

00:07.268 --> 00:09.661
<i>I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.</i>

00:09.705 --> 00:11.446
<i>But my pod
got knocked off course.</i>

00:11.489 --> 00:13.274
<i>And by the time I got here,</i>

00:13.317 --> 00:18.061
<i>my cousin had already grown up
and become... Superman.</i>

00:18.105 --> 00:20.455
<i>I hid who I really was
until one day</i>

00:20.498 --> 00:24.067
<i>when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.</i>

00:24.111 --> 00:27.462
<i>To most people, I'm a reporter
at CatCo Worldwide Media.</i>

00:27.505 --> 00:31.074
<i>But in secret I work
with my adopted sister
and my friends</i>

00:31.118 --> 00:35.513
<i>to protect my city from anyone
that means to cause it harm.</i>

00:38.951 --> 00:41.041
<i>I am Supergirl.</i>

00:42.955 --> 00:44.522
<i>Previously on</i> Supergirl...

00:44.566 --> 00:46.655
The Phantom nested
inside of him.

00:46.698 --> 00:48.178
After a short
incubation period,

00:48.222 --> 00:50.137
the victim's life force
leaves the body.

00:50.180 --> 00:53.705
They can now
make new Phantoms?

00:53.749 --> 00:56.273
The Phantom's created
a new Progeny
to destroy innocent people.

00:56.317 --> 00:57.709
Where's M'gann?

00:57.753 --> 00:59.102
She said that
she was going on patrol.

00:59.146 --> 01:00.756
No!

01:00.799 --> 01:03.237
What if there is a way
that we can harness

01:03.280 --> 01:06.370
your piece of M'gann's soul
to stop her from turning.

01:09.156 --> 01:11.027
M'gann.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.507
Kara!
-Father?

01:12.550 --> 01:14.335
Until yesterday,
I thought my father
was dead.

01:14.378 --> 01:16.206
Are you
a Fifth-Dimensional imp?

01:16.250 --> 01:17.729
My magic is back.

01:17.773 --> 01:19.035
Let's go save your father.

01:20.819 --> 01:22.386
My mother built this Anchor

01:22.430 --> 01:24.345
that tethers this place
to the rest of the universe.

01:24.388 --> 01:25.607
And there is a way out.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.043
You mean my magic?

01:27.087 --> 01:28.349
There's only one way
to find out.

01:32.266 --> 01:33.658
Here we go!

01:38.446 --> 01:40.404
That Phantom almost made it
through your portal with us.

01:41.449 --> 01:43.364
I can still feel him,

01:43.407 --> 01:46.715
like shards of ice
coursing through my veins.

01:46.758 --> 01:48.978
No one said pocket-jumping
through the Phantom Zone

01:49.021 --> 01:50.153
was for the faint of heart.

01:56.203 --> 01:58.857
This is getting to you.
I can see it.

01:58.901 --> 02:03.775
The Phantom chills,
the terror,
it's becoming too much.

02:03.819 --> 02:06.387
Don't be
such a killjoy, Papa El.

02:06.430 --> 02:08.606
Because I think I found
what we're looking for.

02:20.836 --> 02:21.837
The Anchor.

02:28.887 --> 02:30.193
We're going home.

03:19.111 --> 03:22.680
Brainy, we've got five
Prime Phantom Progeny
in containment.

03:22.724 --> 03:24.247
It's getting a little crowded
down there.

03:24.291 --> 03:27.250
I'll prepare
another containment unit.

03:27.294 --> 03:29.905
How many containment units
does that make now?
Is that four?

03:31.863 --> 03:33.735
Supergirl would have
stopped this by now.

03:36.390 --> 03:39.871
And that brings us to the end
of our Tower tour.

03:39.915 --> 03:41.656
Thanks, Nia.

03:41.699 --> 03:43.484
First days always make me feel
like an awkward school girl,

03:43.527 --> 03:46.095
so thanks to you all
for making me feel so welcome.

03:46.138 --> 03:47.618
I'd like to say
on behalf of us all,

03:47.662 --> 03:49.838
how great it is to have you
with us in the trenches.

03:49.881 --> 03:50.708
Finally.

03:54.103 --> 03:55.452
M'gann, you should be resting.

03:55.496 --> 03:58.368
I had a vision
of Prime Phantom's lair.

03:58.412 --> 04:00.501
I think I'm still connected
to the hive mind

04:00.544 --> 04:01.719
of Prime and his Progeny.

04:01.763 --> 04:04.418
But how is that
even possible?

04:04.461 --> 04:08.117
When J'onn transfused his piece
of M'gann's soul back into her,

04:08.160 --> 04:09.510
it was just that, a piece,

04:09.553 --> 04:11.642
and not the original soul
in its entirety.

04:11.686 --> 04:14.471
I estimate
M'gann is still about
18% Phantom.

04:14.515 --> 04:17.169
I hate that you're still linked
in any way to his kind.

04:17.213 --> 04:19.128
But don't you see?
It's good news.

04:19.171 --> 04:22.305
Phantoms have the power
to sense a person's life force.

04:22.349 --> 04:24.220
That means that
I have that power, too.

04:24.264 --> 04:28.093
I can use it to hone in
on a specific life force
anywhere,

04:28.137 --> 04:29.443
even in the Phantom Zone.

04:30.966 --> 04:32.359
I can find Supergirl.

04:34.230 --> 04:36.667
-Are you serious?
-We're gonna bring Kara home.

04:36.711 --> 04:38.713
It also means that M'gann
can use her power to sense

04:38.756 --> 04:40.715
the life forces held captive
in the Prime Phantom's lair.

04:40.758 --> 04:44.545
There's a 99.999% probability
that once we find
and release them,

04:44.588 --> 04:46.329
they'll immediately return
to their rightful owner,

04:46.373 --> 04:48.375
thus restoring the Progeny.

04:48.418 --> 04:51.029
Prime will have his Progeny
protecting his lair.

04:51.073 --> 04:53.205
We'll have to be careful
around those talons.

04:53.249 --> 04:55.686
I may already have
a fix for that.

04:55.730 --> 04:58.559
I couldn't wait to get started,
so I stayed up all last night

04:58.602 --> 05:00.212
and made this.

05:00.256 --> 05:03.390
I merged a DEO protogun
and L-Corp's portal energy.

05:03.999 --> 05:05.522
What is it?

05:05.566 --> 05:07.524
Well, I call it a Prototrap.

05:07.568 --> 05:10.832
It's designed to trap
Prime Phantom and
his Progeny hands-free

05:10.875 --> 05:12.703
and transport them
directly to containment.

05:12.747 --> 05:14.357
Just like in <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

05:14.401 --> 05:16.533
-Except that's a movie.
-It's the perfect movie.

05:16.577 --> 05:18.622
-The Prototrap is real.
-Okay.

05:18.666 --> 05:21.799
Rescuing Supergirl and stopping
the Phantom infection.

05:23.801 --> 05:25.716
I was afraid it was
never gonna happen.

05:27.109 --> 05:28.806
The Progeny
are hurting again.

05:33.550 --> 05:35.030
There's a cold
signature forming

05:35.073 --> 05:37.206
at the Noonan's
in Grand Central Station.

05:37.249 --> 05:38.425
I'll monitor it from here.

05:40.427 --> 05:41.428
May I?

05:44.300 --> 05:45.823
Brainy, aren't you gonna
want instructions?

05:46.998 --> 05:48.609
I'm a 12th-level
intellect, Lena.

05:49.653 --> 05:51.046
I'll figure it out.

05:59.271 --> 06:00.621
It's a macchiato mess.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.111
Brainy, Prototrap.

06:16.941 --> 06:18.073
Watch out for his talons.

06:27.865 --> 06:30.433
-Should've stuck to decaf.
-Look.

06:33.654 --> 06:34.655
Her life force is leaving her.

06:40.487 --> 06:41.879
Track it to
Prime Phantom's lair.

06:43.185 --> 06:44.447
Let's help M'gann...

06:52.063 --> 06:53.151
You okay?

06:58.156 --> 06:59.636
<i>J'onn.</i>

06:59.680 --> 07:01.464
<i>No...
-M'gann.</i>

07:01.508 --> 07:02.944
-She's in trouble.
-Go, we've got this.

07:11.561 --> 07:12.475
There's been
a precipitous drop
in air temperature.

07:20.091 --> 07:22.267
The Prime Phantom,
look at his size.

07:23.791 --> 07:25.880
He grows bigger
with every life force captured.

07:29.536 --> 07:30.711
He's fighting it.

07:30.754 --> 07:32.103
We're gonna need a bigger gun.

07:40.764 --> 07:42.766
<i>M'Gann, J'onn,
the Prime Phantom got away.</i>

08:33.817 --> 08:37.212
Sorry.
I usually have super strength.
I can just kick those down.

08:37.255 --> 08:39.127
Are you sure this is right?

08:39.170 --> 08:41.956
I mean,
wouldn't it be too obvious
if they put the exit

08:41.999 --> 08:43.261
where you'd expect it?

08:44.654 --> 08:46.569
The other buildings
are barracks.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.963
Supply room is built
for the Fort Rozz
prison guards.

08:49.006 --> 08:51.400
I know it's in here.
It should look like a mirror.

08:51.443 --> 08:53.750
That only the righteous
can activate.

08:53.794 --> 08:56.057
Instead of a reflection,
you see your home...

08:56.100 --> 08:57.624
and walk right through.

09:05.762 --> 09:07.503
Oh, no.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.026
What? What's the problem?

09:10.680 --> 09:13.857
Kara, activate it.
I need to be sure.

09:18.819 --> 09:19.776
What do you see?

09:23.650 --> 09:24.607
Just us.

09:24.651 --> 09:25.652
It's not working.

09:27.262 --> 09:28.611
I was wrong to have hoped.

09:34.095 --> 09:36.053
The exit can't be broken.

09:36.097 --> 09:37.620
Not after everything
we've been through.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.928
Nyxly, your magic.

09:42.799 --> 09:43.800
Can you fix it?

09:43.844 --> 09:44.932
I'll try.

09:51.895 --> 09:52.940
I knew this was
a waste of time.

09:54.289 --> 09:55.812
What, you're just
going to give up?

09:55.856 --> 09:57.814
Father, please.

09:57.858 --> 10:00.991
Please, think of everything
we've accomplished already.

10:01.035 --> 10:04.560
We made an ally
where there were
only enemies.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.694
We found magic
where there was only misery.

10:07.737 --> 10:10.392
We found each other
after decades apart.

10:11.872 --> 10:15.092
We can't give up now.
Not after all of that.

10:15.136 --> 10:18.661
What else is there to do?
The mirror can't be fixed.

10:18.705 --> 10:23.057
Maybe not,
but you knew Mother
better than anyone.

10:23.100 --> 10:27.365
And you know she never would
have left her guards stranded,
so think.

10:30.064 --> 10:31.108
What would she have done?

10:34.329 --> 10:35.809
She would have built
a second mirror.

10:35.852 --> 10:38.072
Yes. Where?

10:38.115 --> 10:39.334
The supply rooms.

10:44.556 --> 10:46.036
I remember
following this life force

10:46.080 --> 10:49.170
when I felt this tremendous
force pushing at me.

10:49.213 --> 10:52.695
It was like a part of me
was draining away,

10:52.739 --> 10:55.393
and then I saw I was
turning into a Progeny again.

10:55.437 --> 10:56.743
The double soul dilemma.

11:00.529 --> 11:01.704
M'gann's original soul
is with the others

11:01.748 --> 11:02.836
in the Prime Phantom's lair.

11:02.879 --> 11:04.707
When she flew too close to it,

11:04.751 --> 11:07.101
the piece that is
her transfused soul
sensed the original

11:07.144 --> 11:08.798
and they repelled each other
like magnets.

11:09.799 --> 11:12.280
That's why I was turning again.

11:12.323 --> 11:15.849
I was close to having
no soul in me.

11:15.892 --> 11:17.938
Based on
the rate of Prime's
accelerated growth

11:17.981 --> 11:20.157
and disembodiment,
he'll soon reach full maturity.

11:20.201 --> 11:21.942
What happens after that?

11:21.985 --> 11:24.509
He'll become unstoppable...

11:24.553 --> 11:26.598
and it will be impossible
to release the life forces

11:26.642 --> 11:27.730
held in his lair.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.732
That's what happened
on Planet Dheron.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.647
A Phantom was
released there, too.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.344
And just like Prime,
he grew with every
life force he took

11:33.388 --> 11:34.911
until he became
completely disembodied.

11:34.955 --> 11:36.913
A small band
of brave Dheronians

11:36.957 --> 11:39.742
found the Chrysalis holding
the captured life forces.

11:39.786 --> 11:42.919
But its shell had hardened
when the Phantom reached
full maturity.

11:42.963 --> 11:44.442
Even with their most
powerful weapons,

11:44.486 --> 11:45.792
they were unable
to breach it.

11:45.835 --> 11:47.271
The souls were
locked in forever.

11:52.494 --> 11:55.236
We need to find the Chrysalis
before it fully hardens.

11:55.279 --> 11:57.151
Great Sprock.

11:57.194 --> 11:59.936
If we release the life forces
from the Chrysalis,

11:59.980 --> 12:02.199
M'gann will get
her original soul back.

12:02.243 --> 12:03.853
But then she'll lose
her sensing power

12:03.897 --> 12:05.986
to find Supergirl
in the Phantom Zone.

12:06.029 --> 12:08.031
Then we have to find Supergirl
before that happens.

12:08.075 --> 12:09.903
No. Absolutely not.

12:09.946 --> 12:12.166
First we need to focus
on defeating Prime

12:12.209 --> 12:13.994
and releasing
the captured life forces.

12:14.037 --> 12:15.996
-But J'onn--
-If we don't act now,

12:16.039 --> 12:18.389
not only will National City
be lost...

12:18.433 --> 12:21.001
but the infection will reach
a point of a no return.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.872
A global pandemic.

12:22.916 --> 12:24.439
If we only go after Kara,

12:24.482 --> 12:26.615
she'll come back
to find another Phantom Zone

12:26.658 --> 12:28.008
right here on Earth.

12:28.051 --> 12:29.792
Okay, then we do both.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.794
We rescue Kara
and we defeat Prime.

12:33.535 --> 12:35.450
Guys, we can do this.

12:35.493 --> 12:38.366
We can do anything
if we just put our minds
together.

12:38.409 --> 12:41.673
We always find a way.

12:41.717 --> 12:46.809
Absolutely. There's got to
be another way
to find Prime's Lair.

12:46.853 --> 12:50.682
There is still a way,
if we combine M'gann's
sensing power

12:50.726 --> 12:52.728
and Dreamer's ability
to astral project.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.817
So I'll work on a way
to try and copy
M'gann's sensing power

12:54.861 --> 12:56.514
to track Supergirl.
See, it's win-win.

12:56.558 --> 12:57.864
You heard the lady,
let's go.

13:04.871 --> 13:07.656
-Hey, thanks for backing me up.
-No, of course.

13:07.699 --> 13:10.311
Okay. So what
are you thinking?

13:10.354 --> 13:13.314
Q-waves. I use them
to replicate Malefic's powers.

13:13.357 --> 13:15.533
I believe I can do the same
with M'gann's
sensing abilities.

13:15.577 --> 13:17.753
And the nanobots?

13:17.797 --> 13:18.885
I'm gonna task them
to map the brains of
the Progeny in containment

13:18.928 --> 13:21.104
to create a device,

13:21.148 --> 13:24.020
but even if I am able do that,
I'm gonna need
a piece of Kara's DNA

13:24.064 --> 13:26.675
to calibrate the device
to the right frequency
in order to track her.

13:29.069 --> 13:30.070
I know where we can find some.

13:37.555 --> 13:38.339
Hey.

13:39.906 --> 13:40.907
You okay?

13:42.822 --> 13:44.649
You had a dream when we were
at Noonan's, didn't you?

13:44.693 --> 13:49.045
The same one.
Kara and Alex in high school.

13:49.089 --> 13:52.570
And I don't know why I keep
dreaming it, or what it means.

13:57.097 --> 14:02.885
Are you okay?
You've practically inhaled
every donut in that box.

14:02.929 --> 14:05.888
Strawberry glaze with sprinkles
is a rare delicacy.

14:05.932 --> 14:09.326
That is true.
But I know what
this is, Brainy.

14:10.197 --> 14:11.894
With your inhibitors off,

14:11.938 --> 14:13.374
you're feeling
a lot of emotions
right now.

14:18.205 --> 14:20.120
Lena advised me
to embrace them.

14:20.163 --> 14:22.905
Right now,
you're not embracing them,
you're eating them.

14:24.951 --> 14:25.952
Mmm.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.870
I've been there.
Kara and Alex, too.

14:32.306 --> 14:33.307
Their dumpling obsession.

14:35.309 --> 14:37.615
A donut can't be there
for you...

14:39.182 --> 14:40.401
but I'm here if you wanna talk.

14:42.969 --> 14:46.146
-It's not a problem, Nia.
-Okay.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.977
Well, I can stop comfort eating
whenever I want.

14:52.326 --> 14:53.327
Okay.

14:58.810 --> 15:01.248
Twenty-four storage rooms
and still no mirror.

15:05.208 --> 15:07.645
Kara! Nyxly!
I found it!

15:12.912 --> 15:14.652
What happened?

15:14.696 --> 15:16.959
It was the prisoner with
the scar that captured me.

15:17.003 --> 15:18.961
He must have
been following us.

15:19.005 --> 15:21.529
He attacked your father
and then he tried
to take the mirror,

15:21.572 --> 15:22.878
but I chased him off.

15:24.271 --> 15:26.099
I knew we shouldn't
have split up.

15:33.497 --> 15:36.936
-I think my ankle is broken.
-Okay, don't move.

15:40.591 --> 15:42.158
Okay. Slowly.

15:45.074 --> 15:48.817
-Nyxly, can you
do anything to help?
-I'll try.

15:55.041 --> 15:58.783
My magic is still depleted.
I'm sorry.

15:58.827 --> 16:02.222
I still don't get why I can't
get anything right today.

16:02.265 --> 16:04.876
I never should have
left the two of you alone,
defenseless.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.617
I could have prevented this.

16:06.661 --> 16:09.925
This is not your fault.
It was my decision to split up.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.144
You saved his life.

16:17.106 --> 16:18.629
It will take both of us
to get this mirror

16:18.673 --> 16:21.023
all the way back to the Anchor.

16:21.067 --> 16:25.027
Who's going to
help your father?
He can't even stand.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.333
Just leave me here.

16:27.247 --> 16:28.030
No.

16:29.118 --> 16:31.207
No. Absolutely not.

16:31.251 --> 16:33.644
This area isn't safe
for anyone with Scar
and the Phantoms roaming.

16:33.688 --> 16:38.040
Please, just take this mirror
to the Anchor,
activate the exit

16:38.084 --> 16:40.521
and if it works,
you can come back for me.

16:40.564 --> 16:42.349
He has a point, Kara.

16:46.092 --> 16:50.009
If we don't
get him to the exit,
his wounds will never heal.

16:53.447 --> 16:55.275
Father, I can't just
leave you here.

16:55.318 --> 16:56.667
I'll barricade the door.
I'll be safe.

16:56.711 --> 16:57.712
No. I won't.

16:59.757 --> 17:00.932
Please.

17:03.805 --> 17:05.111
No one's called me that
in decades.

17:12.118 --> 17:13.728
We'll come back for you
as soon as we can.

17:17.993 --> 17:21.475
<i>Family isn't about blood
or last names.</i>

17:21.518 --> 17:23.738
<i>It's about the people
who love you
for who you are</i>

17:23.781 --> 17:25.914
<i>and stand by you
no matter what.</i>

17:25.957 --> 17:29.309
<i>And just as my sister Alex
has always been there for me,</i>

17:29.352 --> 17:33.095
<i>so have my friends.
They're my family, too.</i>

17:33.139 --> 17:36.664
<i>Anything is possible when
you have family who
love and support you.</i>

17:36.707 --> 17:38.709
It's so amazing
to see and hear Kara.

17:40.711 --> 17:41.625
Feels so real.

17:43.366 --> 17:44.759
I mean, I know she's not
here with us, but...

17:44.802 --> 17:45.977
She'll be here soon.

17:47.370 --> 17:49.459
I know it.

17:49.503 --> 17:54.725
<i>We may not always agree,
and at times that may
break us apart,</i>

17:54.769 --> 17:58.164
<i>but in the end, we always
come back together,
stronger than ever.</i>

17:59.208 --> 18:01.993
Hold on, sis.
We're coming.

18:05.214 --> 18:09.958
The core of this crystal
contains Kara's
digital life force.

18:11.351 --> 18:13.788
I would like you to use it
for the device.

18:15.006 --> 18:16.356
What?

18:16.399 --> 18:17.487
You said you need a piece
of my sister

18:17.531 --> 18:19.489
to track her
in the Phantom Zone.

18:19.533 --> 18:21.926
Yeah, but if I
extract that, you'll lose
the recording forever.

18:21.970 --> 18:25.278
Well, what matters most
is that we get back
the real Kara.

18:25.321 --> 18:28.324
And you said that life force
can do that, right?

18:28.368 --> 18:30.805
Yeah, I mean, I'm hopeful,
but there's no guarantee.

18:35.636 --> 18:36.463
I trust you.

18:38.813 --> 18:39.640
Thank you.

18:43.209 --> 18:44.775
Um...

18:44.819 --> 18:46.125
I'll let you know
when I'm done.

18:46.908 --> 18:48.083
I'm gonna stay.

18:49.389 --> 18:51.304
I would like to help.

18:54.002 --> 18:55.830
Well, suit up.

19:07.233 --> 19:08.799
M'gann will use
her sensing powers

19:08.843 --> 19:10.801
to find the highest
concentration of life forces.

19:10.845 --> 19:13.413
That should be
Prime Phantom's lair.

19:13.456 --> 19:15.415
Hopefully,
in locating the lair,
you'll be able to ascertain

19:15.458 --> 19:17.199
the condition of the Chrysalis.

19:17.243 --> 19:18.940
In particular,
any hardening of
its outer shell.

19:21.072 --> 19:23.162
-You ready?
-Let's do this.

19:40.309 --> 19:43.399
All right, looking for clues.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.242
Come on,
they're counting
on you.

20:16.998 --> 20:18.347
Still translucent.

20:32.231 --> 20:35.451
-Are you all right?
-It was horrible. I'm so cold.

20:35.495 --> 20:37.453
-Are you okay?
-Midvale.

20:38.715 --> 20:40.674
I saw Midvale again.

20:40.717 --> 20:42.545
So, is that where the lair is?

20:42.589 --> 20:44.591
I don't think so.
I'm sorry.

20:46.157 --> 20:47.724
But there's something else.

20:47.768 --> 20:50.161
The Chrysalis,
it's turning solid.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.469
We're running out of time.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.478
Based on what Dreamer
just witnessed,

21:02.522 --> 21:04.350
I've calculated that
the Chrysalis will
become impenetrable,

21:04.393 --> 21:06.874
trapping the lost life forces
in one hour's time.

21:06.917 --> 21:10.356
Our only hope now is
to find that Chrysalis
before that happens.

21:10.399 --> 21:13.533
If we release all of
the life forces back to
their rightful owners,

21:13.576 --> 21:16.318
we'll cure everyone at once
and disempower
the Prime Phantom.

21:16.362 --> 21:19.060
Well, we can't do that
until we find the Chrysalis.

21:19.843 --> 21:21.715
I can lead us to it.

21:21.758 --> 21:25.240
No. No, M'gann.
If you get too close,
you'll transform.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.590
-I'm not gonna lose you again.
-We have no other choice.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.420
Actually, we do.

21:34.510 --> 21:37.165
It took some work,
but it's finished.

21:37.208 --> 21:39.559
With this, we will be able to
find Kara in the Phantom Zone.

21:39.602 --> 21:41.430
We'll finally be able
to bring her home.

21:42.388 --> 21:44.215
Not today.

21:44.259 --> 21:46.348
Look, in less than an hour,
the Chrysalis will harden over,

21:46.392 --> 21:49.569
trapping all those souls
inside it forever.

21:49.612 --> 21:52.398
Plus more people are
getting infected by Phantoms
every minute.

21:52.441 --> 21:54.530
It's spreading like a plague.

21:54.574 --> 21:58.621
Now, I know how hard you
worked on making a device
that can track Kara.

21:58.665 --> 22:01.058
But now we need
to recalibrate it

22:01.102 --> 22:03.191
so that we can find
the Chrysalis instead.

22:03.234 --> 22:05.759
But if we recalibrate it,
we'll overwrite Kara's DNA.

22:05.802 --> 22:07.369
We'll lose our only chance
to save her.

22:07.413 --> 22:09.763
We'll find another way.
There's always another way.

22:09.806 --> 22:13.375
-She taught us that.
-We have a way now.

22:13.419 --> 22:15.551
How can you choose
to save anyone else
over your own sister?

22:15.595 --> 22:19.425
Because if I don't,
countless lives will be lost.

22:20.817 --> 22:23.167
Kara would always choose
saving others.

22:23.211 --> 22:25.779
That's just who she is.

22:25.822 --> 22:28.521
And how do you think she would
feel if we rescued her

22:28.564 --> 22:31.045
and she found out
that we let thousands,

22:31.088 --> 22:34.222
maybe hundreds of thousands
of people die,

22:34.265 --> 22:37.573
just so we could
have her back?

22:37.617 --> 22:41.447
Supergirl relies on those
that she loves
to follow her example.

22:41.490 --> 22:45.407
So please don't make this
any harder than it already is.

22:47.148 --> 22:48.802
Give me the device.

22:48.845 --> 22:50.847
Alex, I hear what you're
saying...

22:53.328 --> 22:55.112
but I have to bring Kara back.

22:55.156 --> 22:57.593
You see, it's my fault.

22:57.637 --> 23:00.770
It was my brother who sent her
to the Phantom Zone,

23:00.814 --> 23:02.685
it was my experiments
that empowered him.

23:02.729 --> 23:05.471
It was my war with Supergirl
that started all of this.

23:05.514 --> 23:07.908
So if this is my only chance
to make it right,

23:07.951 --> 23:09.475
then I have to do it.

23:09.518 --> 23:13.609
Okay, Lena, listen to me.
Nobody blames you for this.

23:13.653 --> 23:16.438
Kara doesn't
blame you for this.

23:16.482 --> 23:17.700
You two already
forgave each other

23:17.744 --> 23:19.310
for everything
that happened in the past.

23:19.354 --> 23:23.489
So it's time for you
to forgive yourself.

23:23.532 --> 23:28.102
And all that really matters
is that you did
the right thing today.

23:29.712 --> 23:33.107
So, please give me
the tracking device.

23:40.506 --> 23:43.465
I'm sorry,
but I can't take no
for an answer.

23:48.862 --> 23:51.125
One, two, three.

23:54.868 --> 23:56.565
Okay.

24:15.628 --> 24:16.629
It's Home...

24:19.806 --> 24:21.111
It's beautiful.

24:23.592 --> 24:25.333
Let's go find my father.

24:25.376 --> 24:28.728
Kara, we can't.

24:28.771 --> 24:32.383
-It's too dangerous.
-What? No.

24:32.427 --> 24:35.604
Kara, honey. I know you
believe the best in people.

24:35.648 --> 24:40.522
But don't you understand?
Your father is beyond saving.

24:40.566 --> 24:43.090
He's been holding you back
ever since you got here.

24:43.133 --> 24:46.354
Even today, you saw
just how quickly he was
ready to give up.

24:46.397 --> 24:48.704
But he pushed through that.
He got us here.

24:48.748 --> 24:50.967
He also stuck you in a pod
when you were just a child

24:51.011 --> 24:54.318
and sent you
to a foreign planet alone.

24:54.362 --> 24:57.974
He banished you, Kara,
just like my father
banished me.

24:59.802 --> 25:02.370
I'm sorry about what
your dad did to you.

25:02.413 --> 25:04.807
Truly, I am.

25:04.851 --> 25:08.332
But I'm going back for him,
whether you're
coming with me or not.

25:08.376 --> 25:10.509
I should have
just slit his throat
when I had the chance.

25:13.642 --> 25:18.168
I was going to.
I was this close.

25:18.212 --> 25:22.999
Instead, I conjured myself up
as Scar and I knocked
him out instead.

25:24.610 --> 25:27.961
I let him live for you.

25:28.004 --> 25:29.571
You're the one
who attacked him?

25:29.615 --> 25:31.791
Mmm-hmm.

25:31.834 --> 25:34.750
You wanted me to activate
the exit because it wouldn't
activate for you.

25:34.794 --> 25:37.187
Oh! Don't act so shocked.

25:37.231 --> 25:39.363
You wanted to
be free of him,

25:39.407 --> 25:42.236
just like I want to be free
of my father.

25:42.279 --> 25:44.978
You were just too weak
to get rid of him yourself.

25:45.021 --> 25:47.633
Hurting an innocent man
doesn't make you
powerful, Nyxly.

25:49.025 --> 25:51.637
I know what makes me powerful.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.377
And the power
that I have here

25:53.421 --> 25:55.641
is only a shadow
of what I'll have
once I get to Earth.

25:57.904 --> 25:59.819
Hmm.

25:59.862 --> 26:03.170
I was going to go straight home
to the Fifth Dimension

26:03.213 --> 26:05.520
to punish everyone
who didn't stand by me.

26:07.043 --> 26:09.306
But you activated the exit.

26:09.350 --> 26:12.527
In order for me
to get to my home,

26:12.571 --> 26:16.444
I'll have to go through yours.
And you know what?

26:16.487 --> 26:18.794
I think I'm gonna
have a little fun
while I'm there.

26:18.838 --> 26:20.100
Over my dead body.

26:27.498 --> 26:30.980
If I was a creepy Phantom,
where would I keep my lair?

26:31.024 --> 26:33.809
Oh, I know. The sewers.

26:33.853 --> 26:36.812
It's getting cold in here.
We must be close.

26:38.858 --> 26:39.728
This way.

27:04.318 --> 27:05.188
Which way?

27:10.411 --> 27:11.673
This way looks promising.

27:22.728 --> 27:23.598
Alex...

27:24.904 --> 27:26.079
run!

27:54.760 --> 27:56.370
-Brainy! Brainy!
-No!

27:56.413 --> 27:57.588
Don't. Don't.

28:00.983 --> 28:04.900
Get to the Chrysalis. Go!

28:04.944 --> 28:07.120
No. Come on. Come on.

28:12.429 --> 28:13.213
Up we go.

28:57.213 --> 29:00.564
It's a Phantom Zone
on Earth.

29:06.005 --> 29:08.442
No matter what happens,
don't stop.

29:23.109 --> 29:24.458
<i>No! No!</i>

29:32.335 --> 29:33.859
Sentinel, do it now.

31:12.958 --> 31:14.524
You know, this is fun.

31:14.568 --> 31:17.136
But it gets old after a while.

31:17.179 --> 31:21.357
<i>Prisoner interference detected.
Self-destruct activated.</i>

31:21.401 --> 31:24.099
The impact must have activated
the self-destruct.

31:24.143 --> 31:25.971
We have to get out of here.

31:26.014 --> 31:27.711
The only way I'm leaving here
is through that exit.

31:32.151 --> 31:33.587
I can't let you do that.

31:34.980 --> 31:38.026
Go ahead.
Take your best shot.

31:38.070 --> 31:39.985
You and I both know
that can't hurt me.

31:45.991 --> 31:46.905
I know.

32:01.354 --> 32:02.746
No.

32:02.790 --> 32:05.358
-No, no, no.
-Nyxly, we have to go.

32:07.229 --> 32:09.014
Nyxly... Nyxly, now.

32:09.057 --> 32:10.537
No!

32:10.580 --> 32:12.800
<i>Self-destruct in five, four,</i>

32:13.888 --> 32:17.022
<i>three, two, one.</i>

32:39.044 --> 32:39.914
Thank you.

32:43.700 --> 32:47.922
You were right about
the Chrysalis.
I'm sorry I fought you on it.

32:49.054 --> 32:50.707
I understand why you did.

32:50.751 --> 32:53.058
That's a decision
I didn't wanna have to make.

32:53.101 --> 32:54.102
But you still made it.

32:59.064 --> 33:02.632
Listen, I am so grateful
to be a part of the team
here in the Tower,

33:02.676 --> 33:04.069
but I don't think I belong.

33:05.461 --> 33:06.245
Why would you say that?

33:07.463 --> 33:09.074
Well, it's like you said.

33:09.117 --> 33:10.858
I need to stop atoning
for the sins of the past.

33:10.901 --> 33:14.383
And I am determined
to do good in
the world, but...

33:14.427 --> 33:20.085
You and J'onn,
Brainy and Nia,
I'm not like you.

33:22.435 --> 33:24.611
You're true heroes.

33:24.654 --> 33:26.482
I know how much
your sister
means to you, Alex,

33:26.526 --> 33:30.225
and yet, today you made
the most painful sacrifice

33:30.269 --> 33:31.966
because it was
the right thing to do...

33:33.315 --> 33:34.751
and I don't think
I could do that.

33:36.884 --> 33:38.668
Every moment I was running
towards that Chrysalis

33:38.712 --> 33:39.930
I wanted to turn around.

33:42.150 --> 33:44.631
I didn't care if that Phantom
took over the whole city

33:44.674 --> 33:47.068
or the whole world.

33:47.112 --> 33:49.984
I wanted nothing more
than to drop everything

33:50.028 --> 33:51.116
and go after my sister.

33:52.465 --> 33:55.294
I had to rely on my years
of training as a soldier

33:55.337 --> 33:57.296
to help me push
those feelings aside

33:57.339 --> 33:59.559
so that I could do
what had to be done.

34:02.127 --> 34:04.172
You've have
a huge heart, Lena.

34:05.347 --> 34:06.914
And wanting to save Kara,

34:06.957 --> 34:09.003
that doesn't make you
any less of a hero.

34:11.136 --> 34:13.312
Yeah, maybe not.
But I still
don't think like you.

34:15.140 --> 34:20.188
Neither does Brainy.
Or J'onn, or Nia.

34:20.232 --> 34:23.496
I mean, we all have
different life experiences

34:23.539 --> 34:27.108
and perspectives
and strengths.

34:27.152 --> 34:29.154
It's our willingness
to hear each other out,

34:29.197 --> 34:32.896
that's what makes
this a great team.

34:32.940 --> 34:36.074
And if it weren't for
your brilliance
in making that device,

34:37.423 --> 34:38.728
we all would have failed.

34:40.165 --> 34:41.601
You belong here, Lena.

34:43.037 --> 34:47.955
You always have
and you always will.

34:47.998 --> 34:53.091
And besides, you are
the only with a decent
taste in Scotch.

35:07.757 --> 35:09.194
In spite of everything
we went through today,

35:09.237 --> 35:10.195
we're are still
back at square one.

35:13.328 --> 35:14.982
No closer to getting
Supergirl back.

35:17.376 --> 35:19.508
And no matter
how many donuts I eat,

35:19.552 --> 35:21.336
this hopeless feeling
just won't go away.

35:22.816 --> 35:23.599
I feel it, too.

35:25.558 --> 35:27.168
I've had more dreams
about Midvale.

35:30.780 --> 35:32.173
What do you think they mean?

35:32.217 --> 35:33.261
I don't know.

35:34.088 --> 35:36.351
I'm scared, Brainy.

35:36.395 --> 35:39.528
These dream flashes of Midvale,
Kara and Alex in high school.

35:39.572 --> 35:43.576
They keep happening,
confusing me, and I don't
know how to stop them

35:43.619 --> 35:44.664
or interpret them.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.189
I just wish
my mom was here.

35:52.280 --> 35:55.414
Look, I'm sorry
you don't have your mom.

35:59.418 --> 36:00.201
But you have me.

36:02.421 --> 36:03.248
We have each other.

36:09.471 --> 36:12.300
The Prime Phantom
will never hurt you,

36:12.344 --> 36:15.869
or anybody else, ever again.

36:15.912 --> 36:19.220
-I'm glad you're okay.
-Me? I almost lost you
today, too.

36:19.264 --> 36:20.439
Well, now you know
how it feels.

36:28.273 --> 36:33.408
If only there was a way
to use Prime to make
a new tracking device.

36:33.452 --> 36:36.237
I mean, if he was part human,
like the Progeny.

36:36.281 --> 36:37.630
I tried searching his mind,

36:37.673 --> 36:40.415
trying to convince him
to look for Kara...

36:40.459 --> 36:44.158
but all I could sense
was thirst and misery.

36:44.202 --> 36:47.422
He has no humanity,
only instinct.

36:47.466 --> 36:51.470
Instinct. The Phantom,
he tracks by instinct.

36:51.513 --> 36:52.906
He's a bloodhound.

36:52.949 --> 36:54.908
If we can get our hands
on more of Kara's DNA...

36:54.951 --> 36:58.172
Then he'll track her
by instinct.

36:58.216 --> 37:01.393
It's a good idea,
but the hologram crystal
is broken.

37:01.436 --> 37:03.308
How are we gonna get
more of Kara's DNA?

37:03.351 --> 37:06.528
We can collect DNA
from a Kryptonian
after a solar flare.

37:06.572 --> 37:08.617
Or Kryptonite poisoning.

37:08.661 --> 37:11.272
Alex, can you remember
all the times Kara
blew her powers out?

37:11.316 --> 37:13.709
It's only happened
a handful of times.

37:13.753 --> 37:16.408
Once was in a fight
with Red Tornado

37:16.451 --> 37:19.541
and then another was
all the way back
in high school.

37:19.585 --> 37:21.587
-Back in Midvale?
-Yeah.

37:23.328 --> 37:24.938
Nia.

37:24.981 --> 37:28.463
Cassandra,
this is what my dreams
have been about.

37:28.507 --> 37:31.336
If we want to bring Kara home,
we have to go back in time...

37:33.512 --> 37:35.470
to Midvale High.

37:35.514 --> 37:36.819
I just hope
we're not too late.
