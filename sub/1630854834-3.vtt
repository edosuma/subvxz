in Gryffindor or Slytherin.

00:43.251 --> 00:45.211
Yeah, can I do it?

00:45.211 --> 00:47.297
Yeah, see, you gotta fight
these fairy guys.

00:47.297 --> 00:48.465
Randy.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.134
Randy!

00:51.134 --> 00:52.635
The powder room
toilet is broken.

00:52.635 --> 00:54.053
Again!

00:54.053 --> 00:55.513
Did you jiggle
the handle?

00:55.513 --> 00:56.973
Yes, I jiggled the handle.

00:56.973 --> 00:58.767
Will you come
fix this, please?

00:58.767 --> 01:01.144
Okay, okay.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.526
Huh, well, let's see.

01:08.526 --> 01:12.238
It's gotta be the little
black floaty thingie.

01:12.238 --> 01:13.490
What'd you do to it?

01:13.490 --> 01:15.158
I didn't do anything.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.451
Lemme see if there's
water in the bowl.

01:16.451 --> 01:18.495
No!
Don't lift the lid.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.205
Why can't I
lift the lid?

01:20.205 --> 01:23.208
Don't, Randy!
Uh-huh.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.168
Hey, guys!
Your mom took a shit

01:25.168 --> 01:26.711
and doesn't want me
to see it.

01:26.711 --> 01:28.671
Ew!
Gross, Dad!

01:28.671 --> 01:31.382
Randy!
We need to get a new toilet.

01:31.382 --> 01:33.927
We can't just get rid
of ol' blue, Sharon.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.470
This is embarrassing.

01:35.470 --> 01:38.431
It's the powder room toilet,
the one guests use.

01:38.431 --> 01:40.016
You get a new toilet, Randy,

01:40.016 --> 01:43.019
or I'm not helping you
sell weed anymore!

01:43.019 --> 01:45.396
Alright, alright.
Sharon, you win.

01:45.396 --> 01:46.564
As usual.

01:48.608 --> 01:49.818
Poor ol' Blue.

01:58.034 --> 01:59.786
Can I help you
with anything?

01:59.786 --> 02:02.580
Oh, yeah, just lookin' for a new
toilet to replace Ol' Blue.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.707
Alright, well, all our toilets
here are standard bowl,

02:04.707 --> 02:05.875
come with full warranty.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.168
How much
you looking to spend?

02:07.168 --> 02:08.503
Well I'm not poor.

02:08.503 --> 02:10.547
I happen to have
my own weed business.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.882
So that's pretty much
the nicest one you have, right?

02:12.882 --> 02:14.467
Yeah, that's probably
the top model, you know,

02:14.467 --> 02:18.012
before you start getting
into the Japanese toilets.

02:18.012 --> 02:19.347
Japanese toilets?

02:19.347 --> 02:21.057
Yeah, they're the sort of
the super-high-class

02:21.057 --> 02:22.684
luxury models with all
the bells and whistles.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.395
But you probably don't wanna
spend that kind of money.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.105
I'm not poor.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.858
Oh, well,
we can show them to you.

02:29.858 --> 02:32.068
The Japanese toilets
are right over there.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.075
Hi, Rick.
This gentleman

02:39.075 --> 02:40.869
would like to see
the Japanese toilets.

02:40.869 --> 02:43.079
Well, of course, sir.
My name is Rick.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.081
Let me know if there's
anything you need.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.460
These toilets are all equipped
with the highest-end features,

02:49.460 --> 02:51.254
including an automatic
bidet system,

02:51.254 --> 02:53.756
bluetooth capability,
and seat warmers.

02:53.756 --> 02:56.050
Seat warmers?

02:56.050 --> 02:57.760
And the toilet senses
when you've come into the room,

02:57.760 --> 02:59.971
turns on a small light,
plays welcome music,

02:59.971 --> 03:01.639
and raises the lid
for you.

03:01.639 --> 03:04.350
Can I offer you come
sparkling water or champagne?

03:04.350 --> 03:06.603
Oh, sure,
I'll take some champagne.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.563
All the toilet's functions
are operated

03:08.563 --> 03:10.565
by a touch-button remote
which you mount

03:10.565 --> 03:12.775
where the toilet-paper roll
used to go.

03:12.775 --> 03:14.861
So then where do you keep
the toilet paper?

03:14.861 --> 03:18.197
With a Japanese toilet,
you don't need toilet paper.

03:18.197 --> 03:20.700
The toilet washes you
completely clean.

03:22.827 --> 03:24.203
You're mad.

03:24.203 --> 03:25.997
No, it's true.

03:25.997 --> 03:27.749
It has warm water
and a dryer

03:27.749 --> 03:30.585
and cleans you eight times
better than toilet paper can.

03:32.503 --> 03:34.964
Would you like to take one
for a test drive?

03:34.964 --> 03:36.174
Oh, uh, sure.

03:36.174 --> 03:38.217
I did have kind of
a big breakfast.

03:38.217 --> 03:39.802
Right over here.

03:55.443 --> 03:56.945
<i>Oh, yeah ♪</i>

03:59.113 --> 04:01.366
<i>I, I, I ♪</i>

Oh, oh!

04:20.343 --> 04:22.470
Ohh! Oh.

04:27.225 --> 04:30.979
Okay, how much?

04:30.979 --> 04:34.399
Guys, I wanted to talk to you
because I want you all

04:34.399 --> 04:36.859
to <i>think</i> about how
we're viewed as a family.

04:38.444 --> 04:41.197
You know, as a prominent
weed dealer, we are successful,

04:41.197 --> 04:43.825
and we're sort of looked up to
in this town

04:43.825 --> 04:47.829
because we have nice things
that most families can't afford.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.914
I mean, Stan, you're playing
"Hogwarts Legacy"

04:49.914 --> 04:51.541
on PS5, right?

04:51.541 --> 04:53.626
<i>You're</i> playing
"Hogwarts Legacy" on a PS5.

04:53.626 --> 04:56.087
Yeah, my-- my point is
that most people in town

04:56.087 --> 04:57.672
don't even have a PS5.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.215
They still have PS4s,

04:59.215 --> 05:02.635
and so we're basically
the Kennedys of South Park.

05:03.928 --> 05:07.056
And the plain fact is
that well-off families

05:07.056 --> 05:08.474
have nice things,

05:08.474 --> 05:10.560
and we shouldn't be
ashamed of that.

05:15.106 --> 05:18.276
<i>Hajimemashite.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.403

Delivery men:

05:23.489 --> 05:28.494
<i>Kyo fun yori!

05:28.494 --> 05:31.289
That's the new toilet?
How much did it cost?

05:31.289 --> 05:33.958
Oh, Sharon. Tennish.

05:33.958 --> 05:36.502
What's tennish?

05:36.502 --> 05:38.713
Thousandish.
Ten thousandish.

05:38.713 --> 05:41.924
You spent $10,000
on a toilet?!

05:41.924 --> 05:44.177
We don't have
that kind of money, Randy!

05:44.177 --> 05:45.470
Yeah, we do.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.388

06:07.116 --> 06:08.576

06:41.275 --> 06:42.985

06:44.779 --> 06:46.572
Hey, Richie Rich.
You eating caviar

06:46.572 --> 06:48.199
for lunch today,
Richie Rich?

06:52.245 --> 06:55.164
Stan, just so you know,
nobody gives a shit.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.417
About what?

06:58.417 --> 06:59.752
Come on, guys!

07:02.588 --> 07:04.966
Did you know some people
can't even afford to <i>eat?</i>

07:04.966 --> 07:07.885
How about caring for something
that matters, you bitch?

07:09.345 --> 07:10.763
What the fuck?

07:10.763 --> 07:13.474
Hey, Stan, you really
have to be careful.

07:13.474 --> 07:15.059
Of what?

07:15.059 --> 07:17.103
Look, it's great that you come
from a wealthy family,

07:17.103 --> 07:19.230
but people don't like getting
their noses rubbed in it.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.941
Dude, I haven't
even said anything!

07:21.941 --> 07:23.818
Well, your dad called
everyone last night

07:23.818 --> 07:26.070
and told them you have
a $10,000 toilet.

07:26.070 --> 07:27.321
What?!

07:28.906 --> 07:31.492
Well, thanks for having us
over for brunch, Randy.

07:31.492 --> 07:33.953
Yeah, what's
the special occasion?

07:33.953 --> 07:37.165
Oh, you know, just good times
with dear friends.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.417
Does anyone need
to go to the bathroom?

07:39.417 --> 07:41.043
Uh, no, I'm--
I'm good.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.962
Oh, maybe some
more coffee, then.

07:42.962 --> 07:45.339
Can you guys believe
all the snow we've gotten?

07:45.339 --> 07:47.466
Yeah, maybe it will actually
help with the drought.

07:47.466 --> 07:48.551
Let's hope so.

07:48.551 --> 07:52.054
Does anyone need
a bathroom break?

07:52.054 --> 07:54.390
Well, actually, I-I think
I could use the restroom.

07:54.390 --> 07:55.892
That was kind of
a big breakfast.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.727
Oh! Oh, yeah, sure!
It's, uh--

07:57.727 --> 07:58.728
It's right across
the hallway.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.938
Right there.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.696
Butters' Dad:
Oh.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.364
What was that?

08:10.364 --> 08:12.909
Oh, that's the welcome music
for my Japanese toilet.

08:12.909 --> 08:15.286
I've heard of those.
Aren't they expensive?

08:15.286 --> 08:16.746
Yeah, a bit.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.664
But for those of us
who can afford it,

08:18.664 --> 08:20.166
it's well worth it.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.084
Oh! Ohhh!

08:22.084 --> 08:24.295
Ohhhh!

08:24.295 --> 08:26.005
He's now turned on
the rear jet,

08:26.005 --> 08:28.257
which cleans your bottom
with warm water.

08:28.257 --> 08:29.634
Oh. Ohhh!

08:29.634 --> 08:31.928
Ah!
That's the front washer

08:31.928 --> 08:34.430
that washes your balls,
or vagina.

08:36.849 --> 08:39.393
If you think about it,
a dry piece of toilet paper

08:39.393 --> 08:42.021
can't clean you half as well
as pressurized water.

08:42.021 --> 08:43.689
I feel bad that most people
have to walk around

08:43.689 --> 08:45.399
with fecal matter
on their anus,

08:45.399 --> 08:46.859
but I'm just lucky

08:46.859 --> 08:48.819
I've sold enough weed
to be able not to.

08:48.819 --> 08:51.489
But was it really luck?
Or was it hard work?

08:51.489 --> 08:53.074
Heck, I don't know,
but you know--

08:53.074 --> 08:54.700
Dad, can I
talk to you?!

08:54.700 --> 08:56.702
Stan? You're back
from school already?

08:56.702 --> 08:59.372
I need to talk to you
right now!

08:59.372 --> 09:00.581
The fuck are you doing?!

09:00.581 --> 09:02.041
Fuck are <i>you</i> doing?

09:02.041 --> 09:04.126
You need to stop
gloating to everybody!

09:04.126 --> 09:05.795
I am not gloating.

09:05.795 --> 09:06.963
Yes, you are,
and now kids at school

09:06.963 --> 09:09.215
are calling me
Richie Rich!

09:09.215 --> 09:10.758
They are?

09:10.758 --> 09:12.260
Nobody cares about
your stupid toilet

09:12.260 --> 09:14.053
and you're acting
like a jerk.

09:14.053 --> 09:18.099
<i>I'm</i> acting like a jerk because
I'm trying to help people?!

09:18.099 --> 09:20.059
How are you trying
to help people, Dad?

09:20.059 --> 09:23.479
Because the <i>people</i> don't know
that these toilets are awesome,

09:23.479 --> 09:25.690
and I'm just, like,
the well-respected guy

09:25.690 --> 09:28.484
who's trying to open
people's eyes like JFK.

09:28.484 --> 09:31.570
You are <i>not</i> like JFK!

09:31.570 --> 09:33.030
You're just showing off!

09:33.030 --> 09:36.867
Nu-uh, I'm like JFK 'cause
I am trying to change things!

09:36.867 --> 09:39.328
You're part of a very
respected family, Stan.

09:39.328 --> 09:41.539
You should start
acting like it.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.299
Yeah, well, Randy
you haven't been in my office

10:33.299 --> 10:35.009
for a few days,
so I thought I'd come

10:35.009 --> 10:37.345
do a house call to help you
with your hemorrhoids.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.347
Oh! No, Doctor.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.682
I haven't <i>needed</i>
to come to your office.

10:41.682 --> 10:44.268
In fact, I don't think I'll be
needing your services anymore

10:44.268 --> 10:46.854
since I've gotten
a Japanese toilet.

10:46.854 --> 10:48.230
Oh-- Oh, really?

10:48.230 --> 10:50.232
It's completely
changed my life.

10:50.232 --> 10:52.234
I'm healthier,
I'm less stressed,

10:52.234 --> 10:55.071
and I don't get hemorrhoids
'cause I'm not smearing shit

10:55.071 --> 10:56.906
all over my ass
with toilet paper.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.407
Huh.

10:58.407 --> 10:59.700
Here, here.
You wanna come see it?!

11:00.659 --> 11:02.328
Go on, check it out.

11:15.424 --> 11:17.385
D-Dr. Sheltair?

11:19.387 --> 11:21.722
Dr. Sheltair?!

11:21.722 --> 11:23.766
You stupid!

11:23.766 --> 11:26.352
You ruined Tuscany!
Gah!

11:26.352 --> 11:27.978
Stop it!
I hate you!

11:27.978 --> 11:30.314
I hate you! I hate you!

11:30.314 --> 11:32.483
Go on!
Get out of here!

11:32.483 --> 11:33.943
How am I supposed to tell
my wife

11:33.943 --> 11:36.654
we can't afford
to go to Tuscany now?!

11:36.654 --> 11:39.990
I never realized you made
so much money off my ass.

11:39.990 --> 11:42.034
Go on. Get.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.661
Get!

11:53.421 --> 11:55.047
Hey, Stan!
Stan hold up!

11:55.047 --> 11:56.715
What?

11:56.715 --> 11:58.843
Well, um, you're just
a really good friend, Stan,

11:58.843 --> 12:00.970
and-- and I was gonna
ask if maybe

12:00.970 --> 12:02.680
I could borrow
your plungercost?

12:02.680 --> 12:05.141
What's a plungercost?

12:05.141 --> 12:07.893
when your toilet's nice
as yours, Richie Rich!

12:09.645 --> 12:12.314
I did it!
I called Stan Richie Rich, too!

12:12.314 --> 12:14.900
That was fun!

12:17.403 --> 12:20.364
Stan, you've got to stop
bragging about your toilet.

12:20.364 --> 12:22.199
I'm not bragging
about my toilet!

12:22.199 --> 12:24.160
And why is it
such a big deal anyway?

12:24.160 --> 12:27.997
It's a big deal, Stan.
You just don't understand why.

12:30.833 --> 12:34.420
Have you ever asked yourself
why we use toilet paper?

12:34.420 --> 12:37.756
We're told to wash our hands...
wear masks in crowds...

12:37.756 --> 12:39.800
but for some reason,
when it comes to wiping our ass,

12:39.800 --> 12:42.803
we're told to do it
with this little piece of paper.

12:42.803 --> 12:45.347
We are all-- all of us--
walking around right now

12:45.347 --> 12:48.225
with a little bit of shit
smeared on our buttholes.

12:48.225 --> 12:50.102
Did you know that 70%
of people in the world

12:50.102 --> 12:53.022
don't even use it at all?

12:53.022 --> 12:54.982
70% of the world
doesn't use toilet paper?

12:54.982 --> 12:56.942
Look it up.

12:56.942 --> 12:59.570
Most people in the world still
use good ol' soap and water.

12:59.570 --> 13:02.448
The average American
uses 140 rolls

13:02.448 --> 13:04.366
of toilet paper per year.

13:04.366 --> 13:06.952
Can you even begin to imagine
how many trees that is?

13:06.952 --> 13:08.787
To supply the United States
its toilet paper,

13:08.787 --> 13:13.626
it takes 31.1 million
trees per year.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.461
A million acres per year
of precious

13:15.461 --> 13:16.837
Canadian Boreal
forest alone,

13:16.837 --> 13:19.632
releasing upwards
of 25 metric tons of CO2

13:19.632 --> 13:22.009
and leveling 90%
of the land barren.

13:22.009 --> 13:24.637
So, then, why do Americans
use it so much?

13:24.637 --> 13:26.597
Well, that's the big question,
isn't it?

13:26.597 --> 13:29.266
None of it makes any sense.

13:29.266 --> 13:31.393
Just tell your dad to stop.

13:31.393 --> 13:33.145
Americans don't want
to change their toilets

13:33.145 --> 13:35.606
and they never will.

13:35.606 --> 13:38.651
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
a public service announcement.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.529
One of our citizens
has asked to speak with you.

13:41.529 --> 13:44.448
Please welcome
Mr. Randy S. Marsh.

13:48.827 --> 13:51.789
Thank you, Mayor.
Thank you, everyone.

13:51.789 --> 13:54.208
You know, the Marshes are
a family that try to always

13:54.208 --> 13:55.918
lead by example.

13:55.918 --> 13:59.797
And we know that
all of you appreciate that.

13:59.797 --> 14:04.677
Everyone deserves to be clean,
and the truth is, you can be.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.345
You might not be the Marshes,

14:06.345 --> 14:09.682
but you can afford
a Japanese toilet.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.518
Just not a really nice one
like what we have.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.144
If you take into account
the money

14:14.144 --> 14:17.439
we all spend on toilet paper,
doctors, and hemorrhoid cream,

14:17.439 --> 14:21.819
a Japanese toilet pays
for itself in just a few years.

14:21.819 --> 14:25.364
There are actually Japanese
toilets made for commoners.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.908
Walmart and Amazon
all carry the lower

14:27.908 --> 14:31.453
cost of shitty Japanese toilets
that anyone can afford.

14:31.453 --> 14:33.289
There's even these like
attachment thingies

14:33.289 --> 14:34.623
for your existing toilet

14:34.623 --> 14:37.167
which will make you feel
like a Marsh yourself.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.587
They may not be
Nihon No style-ru,

14:39.587 --> 14:42.256
but they are
good enough for you guys.

14:42.256 --> 14:47.845
The point is-- even commoners
don't need toilet paper anymore!

14:47.845 --> 14:50.472
And, so, I am suggesting that
this town puts all--

14:52.600 --> 14:55.894
Holy shit!

14:55.894 --> 14:57.813
Randy?! Wah!

15:04.820 --> 15:07.656
I'm sorry,
but he's in critical condition.

15:07.656 --> 15:09.450
Who shot him?

15:09.450 --> 15:11.285
Nobody knows.

15:11.285 --> 15:13.203
Is he gonna be okay?

15:13.203 --> 15:14.705
He's in a coma.

15:14.705 --> 15:18.250
He's unconscious
and just blabbering nonsense.

15:19.793 --> 15:24.548
<i>Bikkuri... Bikkurishita...
Taiehn deshou...</i>

15:24.548 --> 15:27.801
Mr. Marsh, your whole
family is here.

15:27.801 --> 15:30.721
Your wife, your daughter,
and your son.

15:30.721 --> 15:33.349
<i>T-Toire Wa?</i>

15:33.349 --> 15:35.601
No, your toilet
is back at the farm.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.771
<i>Taihen ja naaaa....</i>

15:38.771 --> 15:41.398
Dad, I'm sorry I yelled
at you before.

15:41.398 --> 15:44.234
I didn't know you were
really trying to help.

15:44.234 --> 15:47.821
<i>Kon-nichi waaa...</i>

15:49.615 --> 15:53.452
- Stan, where are you going?
- I let dad down once.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.621
Somebody has to pick up
where he left off.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.545
I promise
we're doing all we can.

16:03.545 --> 16:04.922
I'm sorry for what happened,

16:04.922 --> 16:06.882
but you need to leave it
to the professionals.

16:06.882 --> 16:08.884
There's something
more going on here.

16:08.884 --> 16:11.220
I think my dad was on
to something and I

16:11.220 --> 16:13.305
didn't listen to him,
and now he's in a hospital.

16:13.305 --> 16:14.723
We've already got a few leads

16:14.723 --> 16:16.475
and we're following up
on all of them.

16:16.475 --> 16:19.603
I assure you we take this
all very seriously.

16:19.603 --> 16:21.522
This isn't a joke to us.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.524
- Chief, hey, Chief!
- Yeah?

16:23.524 --> 16:24.900
An angry proctologist
walked in

16:24.900 --> 16:26.860
to the toilet section
of Home Depot.

16:26.860 --> 16:28.737
Y-Yeah?

16:28.737 --> 16:30.656
Proctologist says
to the toilet manager,

16:30.656 --> 16:32.574
"I ain't taking the fall,"
and pulls a gun

16:32.574 --> 16:34.243
on six Japanese delivery men.

16:34.243 --> 16:35.869
Okay.

16:35.869 --> 16:37.663
So, then, the six Japanese
delivery men show up,

16:37.663 --> 16:39.540
and the proctologist
has everyone held hostage

16:39.540 --> 16:41.041
and says he's not
taking the fall

16:41.041 --> 16:43.335
for the Randy Marsh shooting.

16:43.335 --> 16:44.962
Oh, shit, this is
actually happening?!

16:44.962 --> 16:46.880
Come on people let's go!

16:49.675 --> 16:51.468
I ain't going down for this!

16:51.468 --> 16:55.013
You got that, coppers?!
I didn't shoot anybody!

16:55.013 --> 16:56.265
But if I'm going down,

16:56.265 --> 16:58.767
I'll take these careless
bastards out with me!

16:58.767 --> 17:00.561
Would you like some
sparkling water or cham--

17:02.688 --> 17:04.189
Come on out.

17:04.189 --> 17:07.151
There's no other way,
we have you surrounded.

17:07.151 --> 17:09.945
I didn't shoot
Randy Marsh!

17:09.945 --> 17:12.740
<i>- Taihen!</i>
- Nobody's saying you did!

17:12.740 --> 17:16.034
No, but they're gonna
use me as their scapegoat!

17:16.034 --> 17:18.203
They'll fix things
like they always do!

17:18.203 --> 17:20.330
- Who will?
- They'll use their lawyers

17:20.330 --> 17:22.750
and their power
to make it all go away!

17:22.750 --> 17:24.960
Just like they did back
when that 2nd grade kid

17:24.960 --> 17:26.920
wrote a story in the school
paper about toilets

17:26.920 --> 17:28.213
two years ago!

17:28.213 --> 17:29.798
They'll take me out, too!

17:29.798 --> 17:31.300
There's no stopping them!

17:31.300 --> 17:32.926
Don't do it!

17:34.678 --> 17:36.638
<i>Sabishiiiii!</i>

17:36.638 --> 17:38.348
Aww! Alright move in!

17:38.348 --> 17:40.267
Secure the area.

17:40.267 --> 17:43.520
2nd grade kid
two years ago...

17:43.520 --> 17:45.981
Wrote about toilets
in the school news paper.

17:49.818 --> 17:53.655
You weren't warning me
about people getting upset.

17:53.655 --> 17:55.365
You know more about this.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.453
Hey!

17:59.453 --> 18:01.163
You wrote a story
in the school paper

18:01.163 --> 18:02.581
and someone came after you!

18:02.581 --> 18:04.792
Yeah I wrote a story,
big deal!

18:04.792 --> 18:07.086
Jimmy, I want to know
who shot my dad!

18:07.086 --> 18:09.087
They took everything
from me, Stan.

18:09.087 --> 18:11.840
My bike... my cat...

18:11.840 --> 18:13.425
They were gonna
sue my parents

18:13.425 --> 18:15.385
for what I wrote
in the school paper.

18:15.385 --> 18:18.972
You're talking about
the toilet paper companies.

18:18.972 --> 18:21.850
Who has the most to lose?
It's all toilet paper, Stan!

18:21.850 --> 18:25.604
Follow the money!
140 rolls per American per year.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.439
Factories pushing out
roll after roll

18:27.439 --> 18:29.191
while razing
Earth's resources.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.026
All of this for
an unsanitary product

18:31.026 --> 18:33.320
that has been proven
to contribute to anal fissures.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.030
Don't you get it, man?

18:35.030 --> 18:38.534
Paper doesn't clean bacteria.
It can't stop viruses.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.035
With all that information,

18:40.035 --> 18:41.495
you'd think
the world health organization

18:41.495 --> 18:43.622
would do studies
to find alternatives.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.207
So why don't they?

18:45.207 --> 18:47.334
Because toilet paper
is an industry worth

18:47.334 --> 18:50.671
billions and b-billions
of dollars.

18:50.671 --> 18:54.925
Kimberly-Clark, Georgia-Pacific,
Procter & Gamble.

18:54.925 --> 18:57.511
They don't want Japanese
toilets in America

18:57.511 --> 18:59.847
and they have the power
to stop them,

18:59.847 --> 19:03.058
and to stop you.

19:03.058 --> 19:05.269
I can't believe
they shot my dad...

19:05.269 --> 19:07.813
because he wanted
to change things.

19:07.813 --> 19:11.441
These people have deeper pockets
than you can possibly imagine.

19:11.441 --> 19:14.778
They can destroy
everything you love, Stan.

19:14.778 --> 19:16.363
Take my advice...

19:16.363 --> 19:20.450
Don't. Squeeze.
The Charmin.

19:20.450 --> 19:24.288
You might be too scared Jimmy,
but I'm a Marsh.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.502
My fellow Americans...

19:30.502 --> 19:32.462
we have been coerced
and brain washed.

19:32.462 --> 19:34.006
While the rest of the world
walks around

19:34.006 --> 19:36.425
with cleaner buttholes,
we are obsessed with dry paper

19:36.425 --> 19:39.344
sold to us by billion-dollar
corporations.

19:39.344 --> 19:42.598
- Yeah.
- Hey, yeah, he's right!

19:42.598 --> 19:44.933
My father wanted everyone to see
that there were alternatives.

19:44.933 --> 19:46.977
But they don't want him talking
about alternatives!

19:46.977 --> 19:48.604
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yea!

19:48.604 --> 19:51.648
And we can't be blindly
buying their products anymore.

19:51.648 --> 19:54.151
And as a town,
we will find alternatives,

19:54.151 --> 19:55.444
and we will not
be afraid to--

19:55.444 --> 19:57.905
Stop! Stop!
We're not doing this!

19:57.905 --> 20:00.282
Dad!
Everyone just stop,
we're not doing this.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.492
Thank you. South Park, uh,
we-we're cutting this short.

20:02.492 --> 20:04.786
I was totally wrong
and I want to apologize.

20:04.786 --> 20:06.496
No, dad, it's the toilet
paper companies

20:06.496 --> 20:08.123
that are behind all the--

20:08.123 --> 20:10.334
Yeah, so, uh, w-we have
nothing against toilet paper.

20:10.334 --> 20:11.919
It's a great product
and, uh,

20:11.919 --> 20:13.545
it was childish of me
to make fun of it.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.172
Thanks, though.
We'll see ya later.

20:15.172 --> 20:16.632
Dad,
we can't just back down.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.009
Bro!
I got fucking shot!

20:20.802 --> 20:22.596
Japanese toilets are
totally unnecessary,

20:22.596 --> 20:24.306
and, uh, in case anyone
else is listening,

20:24.306 --> 20:27.476
I think all of South Park
would like to apologize.

20:27.476 --> 20:30.020
We retract what we said about
toilet paper companies.

20:30.020 --> 20:33.482
They-- They have done nothing
but help us, and we are sorry.

20:33.482 --> 20:36.818
South Park-- everyone--
say you're sorry.

20:36.818 --> 20:39.154
We're sorry.

20:39.154 --> 20:41.323
Okay, great.
Come on, guys, let's go home.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.492
What about helping people
and leading by example?

20:43.492 --> 20:45.661
We're not the Goddamn
Kennedys, Stan.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.287
Stop being an idiot.

21:12.312 --> 21:16.024
Nice to have you back,
Ol' Blue.

21:16.024 --> 21:18.777
You know, guys,
I'm actually not that sad.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.363
Having a Japanese toilet
was great, but...

21:21.363 --> 21:23.198
I've come to realize that,

21:23.198 --> 21:25.784
when you have some big,
nice luxury thing,

21:25.784 --> 21:27.703
it eventually
just becomes normal.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.746
But you start comparing it to
all the other things

21:29.746 --> 21:33.083
in your life which suddenly feel
you have to upgrade, too.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.544
So, it's really best to just

21:35.544 --> 21:38.880
stick with the beat-up,
crappy old things we have.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.632
Love you forever, Honey.
