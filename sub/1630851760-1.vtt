WEBVTT

01:33.593 --> 01:35.595
KEEP TO THE RIGHT

02:15.426 --> 02:16.678
<i>The 44th floor.</i>

02:16.761 --> 02:18.763
<i>-The doors are closing.</i>
-Wait! Hold on!

02:19.848 --> 02:21.391
Thank you.

02:22.767 --> 02:24.561
Gosh, it's hot. Could you…

02:25.228 --> 02:27.397
Oh, my. We live on the same floor.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.773
I see.

02:28.857 --> 02:30.358
It's nice to meet you.

02:30.441 --> 02:31.901
You too.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.320
I live in Unit 4403.

02:34.404 --> 02:37.115
It's my daughter's house, not mine.

02:37.198 --> 02:38.199
I see.

02:38.283 --> 02:41.035
I'm only staying for a few days.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.622
-You must've worked out.
-I did.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.166
You're so pretty.

02:46.249 --> 02:47.500
Thank you.

02:47.584 --> 02:51.212
You look around my daughter's age.
Are you married?

02:51.296 --> 02:52.922
No, not yet.

02:53.006 --> 02:56.843
I see. People nowadays don't need
to get married if they're competent.

02:56.926 --> 03:00.680
My daughter works for an ad company.
What about you?

03:00.763 --> 03:03.808
I also work for a company.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.435
Which company?

03:05.518 --> 03:06.936
-Well, then.
-Right.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.528
Oh, my. You're right next door.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.822
Right.

03:17.906 --> 03:21.326
Goodness. People these days
order delivery too often.

03:21.409 --> 03:25.747
-It's healthier to cook yourself.
-I see.

03:25.830 --> 03:28.374
Would you like some of my side dishes?

03:28.458 --> 03:30.668
No, that's okay.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.046
I appreciate it, though.

03:33.129 --> 03:35.173
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, ma'am.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.135
-Have a good day.
-Okay.

03:58.446 --> 04:00.156
PPOYAN DENTAL CLINIC

04:10.541 --> 04:17.548
DOCTOR YOON HYE-JIN

04:22.845 --> 04:26.349
Dr. Yoon, Ms. Kim Yeon-ok is here.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.226
She's here early.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.814
EPISODE 1

04:34.148 --> 04:36.067
-Hello.
-Hello.

04:38.486 --> 04:40.488
You're from this morning…

04:42.448 --> 04:44.325
What a small world.

04:44.409 --> 04:47.453
You said you worked for a company,
but you're actually a dentist.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.456
Shall we get you an X-ray first?

04:50.540 --> 04:52.417
-Sure.
-Okay.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.007
Thank you so much.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.759
-My pleasure.
-Many of my teeth ached.

05:01.843 --> 05:05.138
I was worried it'd be costly,
but you're too kind.

05:05.930 --> 05:08.891
My daughter's paying, so I wasn't going
to do it if it was pricey.

05:08.975 --> 05:12.270
I see. Your daughter must care
about you a lot.

05:12.353 --> 05:13.646
She does.

05:14.147 --> 05:17.317
Go home safely,
and I'll see you next time you come.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.609
Thank you so much.

05:18.693 --> 05:21.237
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.

05:21.738 --> 05:22.572
Goodbye.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.285
Did we get new magazines?

05:28.661 --> 05:30.413
You don't need to help me.

05:32.373 --> 05:33.791
Aren't these beautiful?

05:34.375 --> 05:36.669
They've been in my online cart

05:36.753 --> 05:38.046
for a long time.

05:38.129 --> 05:41.215
Why? I'm sure you can afford them.

05:41.299 --> 05:43.217
I'm waiting for the promo code.

05:43.801 --> 05:45.887
It doesn't hurt to get a discount.

05:46.554 --> 05:47.972
They're so pretty.

05:48.723 --> 05:52.018
Dr. Yoon, may I have a word with you?

05:52.101 --> 05:53.352
Sure.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.818
I just read your chart.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.236
On Ms. Kim Yeon-ok?

06:02.320 --> 06:04.489
Yes. You suggested only one implant

06:04.572 --> 06:07.742
and three cavity treatments.

06:07.825 --> 06:12.413
Correct. I'm planning to preserve
her teeth as much as possible.

06:12.997 --> 06:16.209
-You're more careful than I thought.
-Sorry?

06:16.292 --> 06:19.087
She'll need to get implants
for the rest sooner or later,

06:19.170 --> 06:23.174
so it's best to get them right now
to prevent any more damage.

06:24.175 --> 06:27.178
The best defense is a good offense.
You know that, right?

06:27.261 --> 06:30.056
And you're one
of the best strikers our clinic has.

06:31.808 --> 06:34.936
All right. Come up
with a new strategy, okay?

06:35.478 --> 06:36.771
She's my patient.

06:39.607 --> 06:42.902
I have the right
to plan her treatment the way I deem fit.

06:43.528 --> 06:44.695
Please respect that.

06:45.655 --> 06:49.075
Sure. If that's what you believe,

06:49.158 --> 06:50.618
then okay.

06:50.701 --> 06:51.828
Good day.

07:02.338 --> 07:03.548
PPOYAN DENTAL CLINIC

07:03.631 --> 07:04.674
<i>What?</i>

07:04.757 --> 07:07.677
What do you mean?
I'm not in charge of her anymore?

07:07.760 --> 07:11.639
The chief doctor is going
to treat Ms. Kim Yeon-ok herself.

07:17.603 --> 07:19.647
What is this? Don't you know how to knock?

07:19.730 --> 07:21.899
Ms. Kim is my patient.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.234
-Give her back.
-What?

07:23.317 --> 07:26.404
I don't care how you treat other patients,

07:27.071 --> 07:28.239
but don't touch mine.

07:28.322 --> 07:29.991
You seem to be hinting

07:30.074 --> 07:32.618
there's a problem
with the way I treat patients.

07:36.581 --> 07:39.208
It seems like you have
a lot to say, so go ahead.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.840
You suggested double-jaw surgery
to a patient with joint issues,

07:45.923 --> 07:48.426
non-insured materials to raise the fee,

07:48.509 --> 07:51.053
and implants for teeth
that could be saved.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.431
Ripping off patients is your specialty.

07:53.514 --> 07:54.474
What did you say?

07:54.557 --> 07:59.020
It's doctors like you that make people
suspect dental clinics of overtreatment.

07:59.103 --> 08:00.688
Are you serious right now?

08:01.189 --> 08:04.650
Did you forget I'm the one paying you?
How dare you act all upright?

08:04.734 --> 08:07.528
You think your salary grows on trees?

08:09.739 --> 08:11.532
Let's get our facts straight.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.826
It's more like you're making money
thanks to me.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.953
Most of the patients here are mine.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.788
Have you gone mad?

08:17.872 --> 08:21.501
How dare you look down on a doctor
who has much more experience than you?

08:21.584 --> 08:25.421
"I will practise my profession
with conscience and dignity.

08:25.505 --> 08:29.217
The health and well-being of my patient
will be my first consideration."

08:29.300 --> 08:30.801
What are you spewing?

08:30.885 --> 08:34.222
The Hippocratic Oath.
Do you even remember it?

08:34.889 --> 08:37.558
And you call yourself a doctor.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.644
Hippocrates would turn in his grave.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.731
What a nutjob. Stop right there.

08:43.814 --> 08:46.817
You won't get away with this.
You'll never be able to find work…

08:46.901 --> 08:50.238
Hey! You're…

09:04.293 --> 09:05.836
Hippocrates?

09:08.673 --> 09:10.299
DOCTOR YOON HYE-JIN

09:11.926 --> 09:13.803
So you just quit?

09:14.470 --> 09:15.304
Yes.

09:15.805 --> 09:16.847
What about the patient?

09:18.849 --> 09:20.726
I introduced her to another clinic.

09:21.352 --> 09:24.939
What is the motto you've lived by
for the past 20 years?

09:25.022 --> 09:27.024
"Don't be nosy and focus on myself."

09:27.108 --> 09:30.987
Exactly. It was very unlike you
to care about her.

09:31.070 --> 09:34.323
She was on a power trip.
I have my own convictions as a doctor.

09:34.407 --> 09:38.911
I see. Is that why you bought
those shoes as soon as you quit?

09:38.995 --> 09:43.207
Of course. I gifted myself
a little something for my retirement.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.669
The underlying message is
"Better days to come."

09:46.752 --> 09:49.589
I'm sure your credit card company
sent you a message first.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.091
"You have to pay
an extra two million won this month."

09:52.174 --> 09:54.093
-Let's break up.
-Sure.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.728
So what will you do?

10:04.312 --> 10:06.939
Are you going to be jobless
and have bad credit?

10:07.023 --> 10:10.192
I don't know. I don't have
enough money to open my own clinic.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.946
I'll have to slave away
under someone wealthier than me.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.326
I just hope I get paid well.

10:20.077 --> 10:22.538
We're going to be slaves forever.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.416
We got to find a way to escape it.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.964
-Let's drink until we drop.
-Sounds good.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.856
I didn't even shower.

10:51.275 --> 10:52.401
What time is it?

10:54.362 --> 10:55.488
DR. LEE

10:57.490 --> 10:59.450
You're texting me already?

11:00.701 --> 11:03.120
Can't run things without me?

11:06.707 --> 11:09.460

11:09.543 --> 11:10.961

<i>You will never be able to work

11:45.246 --> 11:47.289
I should delete this. Remove.

AFTER MUCH CONSIDERATION,
WE DECIDED NOT TO RECRUIT YOU

<i>This is bad.</i>

13:01.739 --> 13:05.159
<i>Your chief doctor must be spreading

14:45.843 --> 14:47.177
-Du-sik.
-Yes?

14:47.261 --> 14:49.054
I asked for a competent worker,

14:49.138 --> 14:51.974
so how could you send me
a guy who gets very seasick?

14:52.057 --> 14:55.394
Jeez. You're still just as impatient.

14:55.477 --> 14:58.147
No one's a pro from the start.
They need time to adjust.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.941
Hey, a fisherman
that can't ride a boat is ridiculous.

15:01.525 --> 15:04.695
He's a rookie, so cut him some slack.

15:04.778 --> 15:07.031
He came all the way
to Korea to work, you know?

15:07.114 --> 15:08.741
I know. Fine.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.164
How are you holding up?

15:15.247 --> 15:16.624
I was struggling

15:16.707 --> 15:19.209
because the boat was swaying.

15:19.293 --> 15:22.087
But now, even the ground is swaying.

15:22.171 --> 15:24.757
We call it "land sickness."

15:32.181 --> 15:33.182
Here.

15:33.849 --> 15:34.850
It's peppermint tea.

15:34.934 --> 15:35.768
I see.

15:37.186 --> 15:40.814
I dried the leaves myself.
It'll help you with the nausea.

15:40.898 --> 15:41.899
Thank you.

15:45.277 --> 15:46.111
Good?

15:46.612 --> 15:47.488
Right.

15:49.907 --> 15:53.035
Stick these in your ears
before sailing out tomorrow.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.745
They'll help prevent seasickness.

15:55.579 --> 15:56.538
Thank you.

15:56.622 --> 15:57.873
Give me the cup next time.

15:58.624 --> 15:59.541
Also,

16:00.626 --> 16:01.502
good work.

16:02.336 --> 16:04.546
-You too.
-That's it!

16:05.631 --> 16:06.924
Eat before you go!

16:07.007 --> 16:07.841
Next time.

16:08.509 --> 16:11.428
You better not drink in broad daylight,
or I'll tell your wife.

16:11.512 --> 16:14.098
I won't, so enough with the nagging.

16:14.181 --> 16:15.724
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.851
Hurry up, man.

16:17.935 --> 16:18.936
Let's go.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.649
-You're here early.
-Yes.

16:23.732 --> 16:25.859
-Are the goods coming today?
-They already did.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.778
-I see.
-Hey.

16:27.861 --> 16:29.947
-Hello. How's business?
-Good. Try some.

16:30.030 --> 16:31.657
-Should I?
-Sure.

16:31.740 --> 16:34.034
-Isn't it savory?
-It is.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.869
-Hope you sell lots today.
-Thanks.

16:35.953 --> 16:37.204
Are you getting hot water?

16:37.287 --> 16:39.707
Of course. You fixed it after all.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.250
-Have some.
-Gosh.

16:42.626 --> 16:43.752
Thanks for the pot.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.129
Right. Isn't it sturdy?

16:45.212 --> 16:46.630
-It is.
-Good.

16:47.881 --> 16:50.175
Congratulations on the birth
of your grandchild.

16:50.259 --> 16:53.220
Hey, Chief Hong.
Would you like to see a photo?

16:53.303 --> 16:54.805
Sure. Let me see.

16:56.098 --> 17:00.978
The baby takes after your daughter.
Their mouth looks exactly like yours.

17:15.659 --> 17:17.286
I think it's changed a bit.

17:56.825 --> 17:58.660
Mom!

17:58.744 --> 18:02.748
Hye-jin, be careful.
You'll hurt yourself if you run like that.

18:03.999 --> 18:06.210
Okay, Mom!

18:33.445 --> 18:34.530
Hye-jin.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.534
Hey, you're good at this.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.234
<i>Yes?</i>

19:12.317 --> 19:15.112
Hi, Dad. It's me, Hye-jin.

19:15.195 --> 19:17.906
<i>I know. What is it? Is something wrong?</i>

19:17.990 --> 19:20.951
No, I just called to say hi.

19:21.660 --> 19:25.372
<i>It's unlike you. You never call
unless something's going on.</i>

19:26.707 --> 19:27.708
You're right.

19:28.959 --> 19:31.003
<i>-Is that Hye-jin?
-Yes.</i>

19:32.963 --> 19:35.132
Tell her I said hi.

19:35.215 --> 19:38.218
<i>Okay. Bye, then. Take care of yourself.</i>

19:38.302 --> 19:39.595
You too, Dad.

19:44.224 --> 19:45.684
It doesn't hurt to be friendly.

19:45.767 --> 19:48.020
You're always so cold
although you don't mean it.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.238
No candy?

19:58.322 --> 19:59.698
You're not a kid.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.533
But it's so bitter.

20:11.835 --> 20:14.046
Honey, what's the date today?

20:14.129 --> 20:15.088
Today?

20:16.340 --> 20:18.967
I think it's March 23.

20:53.877 --> 20:54.878
Oh, no.

20:55.754 --> 20:58.590
Oh, no!

21:30.539 --> 21:32.124
Thank you.

21:37.629 --> 21:39.965
But did you only find one of them?

21:41.425 --> 21:43.260
I'm truly thankful,

21:43.343 --> 21:46.263
but have you seen the other shoe?

21:46.930 --> 21:49.683
I wore them for the first time today.

21:49.766 --> 21:50.892
They were expensive.

21:52.060 --> 21:54.771
Since you've already found this,

21:54.855 --> 21:57.149
could you help me find the other one?

21:57.232 --> 21:59.359
I guess there have always
been people like you.

22:00.110 --> 22:00.944
Sorry?

22:01.028 --> 22:03.739
If not, our ancestors
wouldn't have come up with the saying.

22:04.573 --> 22:07.909
"Save a person from drowning,
and they'll ask for your belongings."

22:07.993 --> 22:10.245
Goodness. That's not what I meant.

22:10.871 --> 22:13.874
It's just that I have a fear of water,

22:13.957 --> 22:15.917
but you don't seem to.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.337
So I just thought you might help me.

22:18.420 --> 22:22.257
You must be mistaken.
I didn't retrieve your shoe.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.718
Your shoe just floated onto my board.

22:25.844 --> 22:28.555
This shiny object
suddenly appeared in front of me.

22:29.097 --> 22:31.141
Do you know how startled I was?

22:31.850 --> 22:34.186
It wasn't intentional, but I apologize.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.565
I'm not the type to ask
for a favor shamelessly.

22:39.232 --> 22:41.443
But as you can see, I'm barefoot.

22:41.526 --> 22:45.530
And my car is parked far away.
So could you please…

22:46.031 --> 22:48.575
It's healthy to walk barefoot. Move.

22:53.747 --> 22:54.998
What should I do?

23:01.880 --> 23:02.881
Hey!

23:06.343 --> 23:07.969
Take them.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.137
TOILET-USE

23:09.221 --> 23:10.514
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

23:13.225 --> 23:14.059
I'm good.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.436
Then just walk barefoot.

23:23.777 --> 23:25.612
TOILET-USE
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

23:57.269 --> 23:58.270
Goodness.

23:58.353 --> 24:00.897
Hey, kid. Did this just fall out?

24:03.024 --> 24:04.317
Oh, dear.

24:04.401 --> 24:06.903
I'm a dentist.

24:06.987 --> 24:08.113
Can I take a look?

24:10.031 --> 24:12.242
Goodness. It's okay.

24:12.325 --> 24:15.120
You're okay. So stop crying
and let me take a look.

24:17.789 --> 24:19.124
Did it fall out on its own?

24:20.917 --> 24:22.002
No.

24:22.502 --> 24:23.837
That's not what happened.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.340
Oh, no.

24:28.049 --> 24:31.511
I hit him with my shoe pouch!

24:32.387 --> 24:36.266
Then why are you crying
when he's the one who got hit?

24:37.058 --> 24:39.853
I'm sorry.
You're very mature for your age.

24:39.936 --> 24:41.104
Open your mouth.

24:42.397 --> 24:44.441
Open wide.

24:45.942 --> 24:47.235
It's your baby tooth.

24:50.071 --> 24:51.865
Is there a dental clinic nearby?

24:51.948 --> 24:53.825
It takes 30 minutes by car.

24:54.492 --> 24:57.621
I see. Is your house nearby?

24:57.704 --> 25:00.582
He just keeps complaining
without any reason.

25:00.665 --> 25:04.085
That's why when you mentioned it,
that guy said, "Yes, sir."

25:04.169 --> 25:06.338
I'd understand if it wasn't habitual.

25:06.421 --> 25:07.839
Darn it!

25:08.423 --> 25:09.257
Sorry.

25:09.966 --> 25:10.926
Forget it.

25:11.009 --> 25:12.510
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

25:12.594 --> 25:13.553
Oh, it's your wife.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.263
-You…
-What do you mean?

25:15.347 --> 25:17.224
We divorced three years ago.

25:17.307 --> 25:19.059
I'm sorry. It's a force of habit.

25:19.643 --> 25:20.727
Having lunch?

25:20.810 --> 25:22.187
Yes, we are.

25:22.812 --> 25:23.772
What are you having?

25:25.190 --> 25:26.483
Rice soup. Over there.

25:26.566 --> 25:29.527
-Right.
-Why don't you ever eat here?

25:29.611 --> 25:33.865
Since you ate here free for ten years,
you don't want to pay for meals here?

25:33.949 --> 25:35.825
No, it's not like that.

25:35.909 --> 25:39.162
He can't have raw food. That's why.

25:39.246 --> 25:41.122
-I can't?
-You don't eat raw food.

25:41.206 --> 25:42.624
Right. I'm sorry.

25:42.707 --> 25:44.501
I sell cooked food too.

25:44.584 --> 25:47.462
Fish roe soup, pollack soup,
seaweed soup with sea urchin.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.882
I see. We'll come next time then.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.761
You better. Green onion seafood
pancake will be on the house.

25:54.844 --> 25:56.346
Thanks.

25:58.181 --> 25:59.516
Bye.

26:00.141 --> 26:01.268
Mom!

26:01.351 --> 26:05.146
-I-jun! Goodness, my son.
-Hi, I-jun.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.773
What are you eating?

26:08.400 --> 26:10.235
What? Is this blood?

26:10.318 --> 26:14.114
What happened? Did you get hurt?

26:14.197 --> 26:16.449
-It fell out.
-What did? Why?

26:17.033 --> 26:20.245
Your tooth fell out.
You shouldn't have pulled it out yourself.

26:20.328 --> 26:21.621
The hospital. Get the car.

26:21.705 --> 26:23.665
-Okay.
-Calm down, will you?

26:23.748 --> 26:26.459
What happened? Did it fall out on its own?

26:27.752 --> 26:29.546
Who gave you that gauze?

26:36.553 --> 26:37.429
Hello.

26:37.929 --> 26:41.891
I went to the pharmacy
and got him the gauze.

26:41.975 --> 26:43.727
You don't need to worry too much.

26:43.810 --> 26:46.146
-Really, is that so?
-Yes.

26:48.189 --> 26:49.649
By the way, who are you?

26:49.733 --> 26:52.402
Why are you wearing our toilet slippers?

26:53.862 --> 26:55.071
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

26:57.824 --> 26:58.867
Oh, my.

27:08.752 --> 27:12.172
I wonder who took them
and gave them to you.

27:12.756 --> 27:15.216
Well, it's a long story.

27:15.884 --> 27:18.303
I promise to give them back next time.

27:18.386 --> 27:20.847
It's okay. Wear them for the day
and throw them away.

27:21.514 --> 27:23.892
Thank you. I should get going.

27:24.517 --> 27:25.894
You can't leave like that.

27:25.977 --> 27:29.147
Since you're here,
eat something. It's on the house.

27:29.230 --> 27:30.273
That's okay.

27:30.357 --> 27:34.152
You helped my son. I'd feel terrible
for not repaying your kindness.

27:34.235 --> 27:36.196
Would you like some raw fish?

27:36.279 --> 27:37.655
I'm really okay.

27:38.782 --> 27:41.868
If you insist, could I have seaweed soup?

27:43.203 --> 27:44.204
Here.

27:44.704 --> 27:45.538
It looks good.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.123
You can have more rice.

27:49.542 --> 27:52.379
You're so skinny. Are you a size four?

27:52.462 --> 27:55.048
I'm not skinny. I'm a size five.

27:55.131 --> 27:58.760
Back in the day, I was as thin as a stick.

27:59.344 --> 28:01.054
But then, I gave birth.

28:01.137 --> 28:03.598
So these days, I only have this much rice

28:03.681 --> 28:05.809
and lots of side dishes for dinner.

28:07.143 --> 28:09.354
It'll get cold. Eat up.

28:09.437 --> 28:11.189
Okay. Thank you for the meal.

28:16.820 --> 28:17.654
It's good.

28:17.737 --> 28:20.365
-It's all thanks to the oil I use.
-I see.

28:20.448 --> 28:23.535
I used to run an oil store in the past.

28:24.285 --> 28:26.079
Is this your first time in Gongjin?

28:26.162 --> 28:28.331
This is my second…

28:29.582 --> 28:30.542
Third time.

28:30.625 --> 28:31.793
Visit us more often.

28:33.169 --> 28:36.881
I'm not saying this because it's
my hometown. It's a really nice place.

28:38.007 --> 28:39.634
Look at that beautiful sea.

28:40.635 --> 28:44.639
Gongjin Harbor feels like
my late mother's embrace to me.

29:01.656 --> 29:03.783
I love everything about Gongjin

29:03.867 --> 29:06.828
except that there's no dental clinic.
That's the only downside.

29:06.911 --> 29:09.831
I heard that it takes 30 minutes by car.

29:09.914 --> 29:12.459
That's right. Had there been
a clinic here,

29:12.542 --> 29:14.919
patients would be lining up.

29:15.003 --> 29:19.632
I mean, there are a lot of old people
who need implants and dentures here.

29:21.801 --> 29:23.595
-Is that so?
-Yes.

29:23.678 --> 29:26.347
Let me know if you're ever interested.

29:26.431 --> 29:27.974
I'll recommend a good area.

29:30.226 --> 29:31.519
It's delicious.

29:31.603 --> 29:32.520
Right?

29:48.286 --> 29:50.997
<i>Are you free from 3 p.m.
to 7 p.m. the day after tomorrow?</i>

29:51.080 --> 29:52.248
-Sure.
<i>-Help me, Du-sik.</i>

29:52.332 --> 29:53.625
<i>Four hours tomorrow night.</i>

29:53.708 --> 29:55.585
<i>Can you come out again in two days?</i>

29:58.671 --> 30:00.131
<i>Your goods are here.</i>

30:01.216 --> 30:04.469
CHUNG-HO HARDWARE

30:07.096 --> 30:10.016
You're sleeping again.
At least, shut your eyes when you sleep.

30:10.099 --> 30:11.351
My gosh.

30:12.101 --> 30:12.936
Hey.

30:14.062 --> 30:15.647
-Where is it?
-Over there.

30:15.730 --> 30:17.440
-Where?
-Over there.

30:17.524 --> 30:19.234
It's not here.

30:19.317 --> 30:20.193
It's there.

30:20.276 --> 30:22.862
-It's not here.
-It's here.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.531
Here.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.242
It's not funny.

30:33.331 --> 30:34.874
Gosh, check this out.

30:34.958 --> 30:37.168
Look at how shiny it is.

30:37.252 --> 30:38.294
No wonder it's pricey.

30:38.378 --> 30:41.714
You know it. I should charge you
150,000 won for that,

30:41.798 --> 30:43.758
but I'll only ask for 120,000 won.

30:47.345 --> 30:49.556
-Make it 90,000 won.
-It's from abroad.

30:50.181 --> 30:51.015
What?

30:51.099 --> 30:54.769
Then with the shipping fee,
I'll pay 92,500 won.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.313
-This isn't normal delivery.
-I know you.

30:57.397 --> 30:59.524
I know how much profit you make.

31:00.316 --> 31:02.110
Let's see.

31:04.279 --> 31:05.280
What are you doing?

31:05.363 --> 31:06.948
-It's not opening.
-Hurry up.

31:08.032 --> 31:09.909
-Open it already.
-It's not opening.

31:09.993 --> 31:11.703
Come on. Stop joking around.

31:11.786 --> 31:15.290
It's open. I'm going to ask
the grandma to fix this.

31:15.373 --> 31:16.749
One, two,

31:16.833 --> 31:21.921
-three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
-Three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

31:22.005 --> 31:24.465
-nine.
-nine, ten.

31:24.549 --> 31:25.758
Ninety thousand.

31:26.426 --> 31:28.928
Two thousand… Can I give you coins?

31:29.012 --> 31:30.555
-Give me bills.
-I only have big bills.

31:30.638 --> 31:31.806
-Give me bills.
-Take coins.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.391
-Give me bills.
-No small bills.

31:33.975 --> 31:37.228
-Give me 10,000 won.
-Here's 2,500 won.

31:37.312 --> 31:38.938
A 2,500-won bonus.

31:40.273 --> 31:41.441
See you.

31:42.108 --> 31:43.526
Damn it.

31:45.528 --> 31:46.738
-What?
-What?

31:46.821 --> 31:48.364
-What?
-Why are you back?

31:48.448 --> 31:50.158
-I forgot this.
-Okay.

31:52.994 --> 31:55.371
That's worth 20,000 won. Damn it.

31:57.415 --> 31:59.626
Darn it.

32:03.004 --> 32:05.590
Jeez, he gave me ten-won coins.

32:15.642 --> 32:16.809
MONTHLY RENT
YEARLY RENT

32:18.436 --> 32:20.521
It's definitely cheaper than Seoul.

32:22.690 --> 32:24.692
I can afford to open my own clinic here.

32:24.776 --> 32:27.695
MONTHLY RENT 10 MILLION DEPOSIT
YEARLY RENT 180 MILLION

32:28.780 --> 32:31.741
Don't be ridiculous.
Opening a clinic in this countryside?

32:36.245 --> 32:39.123
God, this is driving me crazy.

32:39.207 --> 32:40.792
They were really expensive.

32:45.088 --> 32:46.422
Let's just go home.

32:48.007 --> 32:49.425
Let's go.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.142
What?

32:59.352 --> 33:00.603
Why won't it start?

33:04.148 --> 33:05.858
Did the battery die?

33:08.653 --> 33:10.238
Why now?

33:14.117 --> 33:16.494
Insurance company…

33:16.577 --> 33:17.412
Is this it?

33:18.371 --> 33:20.206
Why now of all times?

33:25.420 --> 33:26.337
Are you serious?

33:34.804 --> 33:36.848
I know I'm in the boondocks,

33:36.931 --> 33:39.183
but how could I not get a phone signal?

33:39.767 --> 33:41.269
Or is it broken?

33:42.895 --> 33:45.773
No. It worked just fine a while ago.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.653
I'll use the phone at the restaurant.

33:53.448 --> 33:54.449
My stomach…

33:55.867 --> 33:57.535
Did I eat too much for lunch?

33:59.829 --> 34:01.789
COFFEE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
AND BEER IN THE MOONLIGHT

34:01.873 --> 34:04.000
Is that a cafe? Gosh.

34:09.005 --> 34:11.549
-Welcome.
-One cup of Americano, please.

34:11.632 --> 34:14.302
-Sure.
-Where's the restroom?

34:16.262 --> 34:18.806
Do you want hot or iced…

34:21.017 --> 34:23.436
Iced coffee all the way.

34:24.729 --> 34:26.689
She must've been in a hurry.

34:30.526 --> 34:32.570
All right, then.

34:40.828 --> 34:41.829
Much better.

34:51.297 --> 34:52.882
"EXERCISING IN THE MOONLIGHT"

34:55.510 --> 34:57.553
Do you feel better?

35:00.389 --> 35:01.933
You must recognize him.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.143
I don't.

35:04.852 --> 35:07.647
Then why were you staring at it?

35:09.315 --> 35:10.775
It just caught my eye.

35:11.859 --> 35:15.863
You may not know his name but his song,
"Exercising in the Moonlight."

35:16.447 --> 35:19.325
He came second on <i>Top Ten Songs</i> in 1993.

35:19.408 --> 35:23.246
<i>Exercising in the moonlight
Because I can't sleep</i>

35:23.329 --> 35:24.539
I don't recognize it.

35:25.665 --> 35:27.500
-Enjoy your coffee.
-Thank you.

35:30.086 --> 35:30.962
What was that?

35:37.385 --> 35:38.302
It tastes horrible.

35:50.398 --> 35:51.315
Seriously.

35:54.902 --> 35:55.820
An autograph?

35:56.612 --> 35:59.157
I'm sorry, but may I use your phone?

36:00.616 --> 36:01.701
Go ahead.

36:01.784 --> 36:03.035
Thank you.

36:05.329 --> 36:08.166
This is the song I was talking about.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.335
I'm sure you've heard of it.

36:11.419 --> 36:13.421
Doesn't the melody sound familiar?

36:13.504 --> 36:17.341
-This is the chorus.
-I'm sorry, but it's not working.

36:17.425 --> 36:19.010
Why wouldn't it?

36:22.555 --> 36:23.931
What? That's strange.

36:25.474 --> 36:26.726
What's wrong with this?

36:27.476 --> 36:28.936
Use my cell phone.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.146
Thank you.

36:31.689 --> 36:32.690
That's strange.

36:34.358 --> 36:36.736
This isn't working either.

36:38.487 --> 36:40.698
Why is neither of them working?

36:40.781 --> 36:42.241
I'd like to pay.

36:42.325 --> 36:43.409
Okay.

36:44.452 --> 36:46.329
You didn't touch the coffee.

36:46.412 --> 36:48.372
What a waste. You should finish it.

36:48.456 --> 36:50.082
It's okay. I just want to pay.

36:50.166 --> 36:51.959
Right. Take it to go.

36:52.043 --> 36:55.379
No, it's okay. I'd just like to pay.

36:55.963 --> 36:57.131
I can be quick.

37:00.009 --> 37:02.511
Okay. All right.

37:03.638 --> 37:04.513
What's wrong?

37:04.597 --> 37:05.514
CHECKING…

37:06.599 --> 37:08.059
It's not working.

37:08.684 --> 37:09.977
Is the card the problem?

37:10.061 --> 37:11.395
My card?

37:13.147 --> 37:15.524
I'm so pissed. Why isn't my phone working?

37:15.608 --> 37:19.904
Pissed? Ju-ri, didn't I tell you
not to use such words?

37:21.113 --> 37:24.700
I think there's a problem
with the card reader.

37:24.784 --> 37:25.660
Do you have cash?

37:25.743 --> 37:27.453
-Cash?
-Yes.

37:27.536 --> 37:28.621
I have none.

37:28.704 --> 37:30.998
Not even 4,000 won? It's just 4,000 won.

37:31.082 --> 37:34.168
You see, I don't carry cash.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.587
Still, how could you
not even have 4,000 won?

37:36.671 --> 37:38.923
Well… I'm sorry.

37:39.006 --> 37:42.093
If there's a bank nearby,
I'll go withdraw some cash right now.

37:42.176 --> 37:44.679
But how can I trust you?

37:44.762 --> 37:47.223
What if you never come back?

37:48.683 --> 37:50.476
-I'll leave my bag here.
-Okay.

37:50.559 --> 37:51.435
Dad.

37:51.519 --> 37:53.729
-What?
-Don't accept that. It's fake.

37:53.813 --> 37:56.107
-It'd still cost more than 4,000 won.
-Hey,

37:56.190 --> 37:57.566
this is genuine.

37:57.650 --> 37:59.068
Stop lying.

37:59.151 --> 38:02.071
What kind of person
carries a pricey bag and wears those?

38:02.154 --> 38:03.948
-Wear what?
-Look at those.

38:04.031 --> 38:07.326
Let me see. "Hwajeong"?

38:07.410 --> 38:09.078
I have my reasons…

38:13.374 --> 38:15.293
I'll leave my phone here. Okay?

38:15.376 --> 38:16.335
Your phone?

38:16.419 --> 38:17.253
Let me see.

38:18.838 --> 38:20.423
It's the latest model.

38:20.506 --> 38:23.301
-Look. It's the latest model.
-What?

38:23.384 --> 38:24.635
You can go.

38:29.473 --> 38:31.475
Gosh. How aggravating.

38:32.101 --> 38:34.645
How dare that little brat
call my bag fake?

38:36.147 --> 38:38.816
She has no idea how much I value brands.

38:44.822 --> 38:47.491
EAST SEA BANK

38:50.619 --> 38:51.746
What?

38:51.829 --> 38:54.540
DURI BANK GONGJIN BRANCH

38:57.418 --> 38:58.252
What?

38:59.086 --> 39:03.257
Excuse me. Why isn't the ATM working?

39:03.341 --> 39:07.261
I'm sorry, ma'am. It suddenly broke down,
so we're looking into it.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.180
We're not sure when it'll get fixed.

39:09.263 --> 39:10.514
I see.

39:16.062 --> 39:19.482
There are some issues
at the banks as well,

39:19.565 --> 39:22.651
so I can neither withdraw
nor wire you any money.

39:24.153 --> 39:27.615
I'm sorry, but could I wire it
to you back in Seoul?

39:28.407 --> 39:31.160
I'd never bilk money,
only 4,000 won at that.

39:31.243 --> 39:32.078
No.

39:33.329 --> 39:35.206
It's not like we can tell.

39:35.289 --> 39:36.207
Look.

39:36.999 --> 39:39.085
This is my business card.

39:39.668 --> 39:41.420
My phone number is written there too.

39:42.046 --> 39:43.339
DOCTOR YOON HYE-JIN

39:43.923 --> 39:45.508
Are you a dentist?

39:46.050 --> 39:47.301
Yes.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.678
Who knows? This could be fake too.

39:49.762 --> 39:51.639
-Hey.
-Dad…

39:51.722 --> 39:53.808
That's real, and so is my bag.

39:53.891 --> 39:55.434
-Watch what you say.
-Is she crazy?

39:55.518 --> 39:56.685
-Dad…
-Are you okay?

39:58.562 --> 39:59.605
Hey.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.358
You ended up wearing them.

40:03.859 --> 40:04.860
Do you know her?

40:05.694 --> 40:08.030
I'm not sure how to answer that.

40:08.114 --> 40:09.407
We do know each other.

40:10.616 --> 40:11.784
We met once before.

40:13.285 --> 40:14.412
What's up?

40:14.495 --> 40:18.916
She's trying to leave
without paying for the coffee.

40:18.999 --> 40:20.292
What? Come on.

40:20.376 --> 40:23.712
That's not true. I ordered some coffee.

40:23.796 --> 40:26.257
But everything is broken.
My credit card, phone,

40:26.340 --> 40:28.092
-and the ATM.
-She's right.

40:28.175 --> 40:30.845
All phones, internet,
and banks froze in Gongjin.

40:30.928 --> 40:32.054
What?

40:32.138 --> 40:33.806
There was a fire at Hanguk Telecom.

40:33.889 --> 40:36.642
Are you serious? No way. Dad, look it up.

40:36.725 --> 40:38.102
It doesn't work.

40:38.185 --> 40:39.270
-Right.
-See?

40:39.353 --> 40:40.563
It really doesn't work.

40:41.480 --> 40:42.523
When will it be fixed?

40:42.606 --> 40:45.443
Probably not anytime soon.
They haven't extinguished the fire.

40:45.526 --> 40:47.069
Awesome. I should go watch.

40:47.153 --> 40:49.488
Hey! You're going to pee
in your sleep tonight!

40:49.572 --> 40:50.656
-Ju-ri!
-Whatever!

40:50.739 --> 40:52.366
-It's dangerous!
-It's not.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.993
-Darn it.
-Hey.

40:54.076 --> 40:56.036
Can you spare me a minute?

40:57.580 --> 40:58.706
Can I ask you something?

40:58.789 --> 40:59.748
Me?

40:59.832 --> 41:01.542
-Yes.
-Okay.

41:01.625 --> 41:03.002
I…

41:04.253 --> 41:08.007
I've never asked anyone
something like this before,

41:08.090 --> 41:11.927
so I'm not sure how to bring it up.

41:12.011 --> 41:14.054
Could you lend me 4,000 won?

41:16.140 --> 41:20.394
I'm never this shameless. But…

41:21.103 --> 41:23.439
Things aren't really going my way today.

41:24.231 --> 41:29.069
I know I may seem
like a nuisance to you. I understand that.

41:30.279 --> 41:34.241
But I'm in an urgent situation right now.

41:35.326 --> 41:38.579
So could you please be kind
and help me out?

41:38.662 --> 41:41.874
You want me to be kind.
So you're not this type of person?

41:41.957 --> 41:46.670
Exactly. Normally, I refuse
to be indebted to anyone.

41:46.754 --> 41:51.175
Let me get this straight.
So if the circumstances allowed,

41:51.258 --> 41:53.052
you could get out of this on your own?

41:53.135 --> 41:54.762
Exactly.

41:54.845 --> 41:55.804
Then follow me.

41:56.931 --> 41:57.848
What?

41:59.725 --> 42:00.559
The 4,000 won.

42:01.101 --> 42:03.187
I'll help you earn it instead.

42:06.899 --> 42:09.944
Look. I'm following you as you said,

42:10.736 --> 42:12.404
but how will I earn it?

42:12.488 --> 42:14.406
Through valuable hard work, of course.

42:16.116 --> 42:19.495
You're not taking me
somewhere shady, are you?

42:20.162 --> 42:21.789
Eun-cheol!

42:21.872 --> 42:24.124
Du-sik, did you hear about the fire?

42:24.208 --> 42:25.417
Yes, just a while ago.

42:25.501 --> 42:27.628
I've been patrolling, and it's chaotic.

42:27.711 --> 42:29.755
Patrol around the shops.

42:29.838 --> 42:31.715
They'll have to call it a day.

42:31.799 --> 42:34.468
Tell them they'll be compensated
once the fire is put out.

42:34.552 --> 42:35.803
Okay. Where are you going?

42:35.886 --> 42:37.930
I'll take a look around up there.

42:38.013 --> 42:39.723
-Okay. I'll call you later.
-Bye.

42:45.104 --> 42:46.146
What? Shady?

42:46.230 --> 42:47.398
Well…

42:48.107 --> 42:50.526
It seems like
you're close with the police.

42:51.110 --> 42:52.069
As you just saw.

42:52.152 --> 42:54.530
Let's stop by somewhere first.

42:54.613 --> 42:55.447
Where?

42:57.199 --> 42:59.702
Gosh, why does he never
answer my questions?

43:09.253 --> 43:10.879
You must've been startled.

43:10.963 --> 43:11.964
There's been a fire.

43:12.047 --> 43:14.717
Be patient,
and they'll get it all sorted out.

43:14.800 --> 43:16.302
I'm off now.

43:16.885 --> 43:17.970
Bye.

43:22.308 --> 43:24.476
The firefighters are putting out the fire,

43:24.560 --> 43:26.854
so stay home for today.

43:26.937 --> 43:28.772
I said I'd fix it tomorrow.

43:28.856 --> 43:30.065
You're so hardworking.

43:31.692 --> 43:34.236
Grandma, let me do it for you.

43:35.529 --> 43:36.655
Where are you going?

43:36.739 --> 43:38.073
I'm visiting the grandmas.

43:38.157 --> 43:39.491
Don't you worry.

43:39.575 --> 43:42.953
The fire broke out underground,
so no one has been injured.

43:43.037 --> 43:44.872
Your radio is working fine, right?

43:49.126 --> 43:52.463
Why is it taking so long
to go to earn money?

43:53.255 --> 43:54.923
I could've just waited at the cafe.

43:55.007 --> 43:58.677
I'm sure you'd prefer this
to being monitored by those two.

44:10.481 --> 44:14.526
There's a fire at the telecom company,
so the phones don't work now.

44:15.444 --> 44:20.949
They're fixing it right now,
so don't worry too much. Okay?

44:23.619 --> 44:24.536
What?

44:25.287 --> 44:27.414
Do you want me to sit here? Here?

44:29.208 --> 44:30.751
Where are you going?

44:31.835 --> 44:32.836
Where?

44:33.796 --> 44:34.630
Jeez.

44:38.175 --> 44:39.009
Gosh.

44:40.427 --> 44:44.390
Are these for me? Right?

44:45.391 --> 44:48.894
You want me to share with her? Thanks.

44:54.400 --> 44:55.734
Thank you.

44:55.818 --> 44:58.070
Thanks for this.

44:59.613 --> 45:01.490
Sit down.

45:03.117 --> 45:04.118
See you.

45:40.654 --> 45:42.030
What do you do for a living?

45:43.699 --> 45:47.578
I heard people here addressing you
as Chief Hong.

45:47.661 --> 45:49.621
Why would an outsider want to know that?

45:50.247 --> 45:51.874
We're here. Over there.

46:05.387 --> 46:06.263
Here.

46:07.890 --> 46:12.060
Are you telling me
to remove innards from squid?

46:12.144 --> 46:13.061
Yes.

46:15.397 --> 46:16.440
You can't be serious.

46:17.024 --> 46:19.067
I've never done this in my life.

46:19.151 --> 46:21.278
I've never even touched a squid before.

46:21.945 --> 46:24.031
Then today's your lucky day. Here.

46:25.365 --> 46:26.408
Don't you need money?

46:29.161 --> 46:30.579
How much is the pay?

46:30.662 --> 46:32.122
It's 8,720 won per hour.

46:32.206 --> 46:36.752
It's 8,720 won per hour?
Isn't that minimum wage?

46:36.835 --> 46:38.795
Do you know who I am?

46:38.879 --> 46:40.255
Yes. A penniless woman.

46:40.339 --> 46:42.174
I don't think you know,

46:42.925 --> 46:44.384
but I'm a dentist.

46:46.178 --> 46:48.514
I'm a bit embarrassed to say this myself,

46:48.597 --> 46:50.933
-but I'm a top-level elite.
-Grandma!

46:51.016 --> 46:52.476
She's here to work.

46:52.559 --> 46:54.478
-What are you doing?
-I'm a bit busy. Bye.

46:55.646 --> 46:57.689
-Hey.
-I'll be back later. Good luck!

46:57.773 --> 46:58.982
-What?
-Who?

47:03.362 --> 47:04.279
Hello.

47:11.370 --> 47:13.372
Let me teach you.

47:13.455 --> 47:16.333
Slice it through the middle.

47:17.125 --> 47:19.545
Spread it open here.

47:19.628 --> 47:22.256
Then pull out the innards.

47:22.798 --> 47:23.757
Give it a try.

47:23.840 --> 47:26.343
Slice it through the middle.

47:30.556 --> 47:32.140
Why doesn't it work?

47:33.267 --> 47:37.312
By the looks of it,
she's not from around here.

47:37.396 --> 47:41.608
Do you know why we're doing this?

47:41.692 --> 47:42.568
No.

47:43.151 --> 47:45.779
-What?
-Hey, explain it to her.

47:46.697 --> 47:49.408
After we clean the squid here,

47:49.491 --> 47:51.410
it is taken somewhere to be dried.

47:51.493 --> 47:55.163
Then it becomes dried squid
that people enjoy.

47:55.247 --> 47:56.540
I see.

47:57.583 --> 47:59.334
How do you know Chief Hong?

47:59.918 --> 48:00.919
Well…

48:01.545 --> 48:05.632
You were with him until a while ago.

48:05.716 --> 48:07.843
We met for the first time today.

48:07.926 --> 48:09.011
-What?
-What?

48:09.636 --> 48:10.679
What?

48:14.182 --> 48:17.561
You should remove all the innards.

48:17.644 --> 48:19.062
Don't leave any of them out.

48:19.146 --> 48:19.980
Okay.

48:21.857 --> 48:22.941
Goodness!

48:23.692 --> 48:25.986
You should be careful with the squid ink.

48:27.321 --> 48:31.992
Goodness. What should we do with you?

48:32.075 --> 48:35.370
Kids these days are like that.

48:35.454 --> 48:37.956
They've never done
this kind of job before,

48:38.040 --> 48:40.626
so they have no idea how to do it.

48:40.709 --> 48:43.670
You're not very dexterous, are you?

48:43.754 --> 48:45.839
You can't make a living
out of those hands.

48:45.922 --> 48:48.884
No one has ever said
that I wasn't dexterous.

48:58.602 --> 49:00.812
Look. Didn't I do a good job this time?

49:00.896 --> 49:03.231
What? Where are the legs?

49:03.315 --> 49:04.358
The legs?

49:06.652 --> 49:07.861
Goodness.

49:10.989 --> 49:12.282
Oh, dear.

49:28.340 --> 49:31.093
How could you leave me like that?

49:31.176 --> 49:33.553
I brought your wage.
I guess you don't need it.

49:33.637 --> 49:35.681
No. Give it to me.

49:37.891 --> 49:39.518
You worked for three hours.

49:39.601 --> 49:43.021
So 8,720 times 3 is 26,000…

49:43.105 --> 49:44.356
What?

49:45.357 --> 49:47.109
-Is this it?
-Of course not.

49:47.818 --> 49:50.737
Here's the rest, 160 won.

49:54.700 --> 49:55.701
What's with that look?

49:56.535 --> 49:58.954
You barely did your job properly.

49:59.037 --> 50:00.622
You don't deserve that money.

50:02.833 --> 50:05.711
How does it feel to get
hard-earned money? Valuable, right?

50:06.294 --> 50:08.797
I've always been a hard worker.

50:09.381 --> 50:10.966
It's not easy being a dentist.

50:13.593 --> 50:16.430
Please give this to the cafe owner.

50:17.931 --> 50:20.267
Okay. Bye.

50:23.353 --> 50:25.564
Right, an auto repair shop. Excuse me.

50:28.525 --> 50:29.568
Why are you smiling?

50:30.944 --> 50:32.904
Do you have a car?

50:32.988 --> 50:34.030
"Cha"?

50:35.699 --> 50:36.658
Yes.

50:39.286 --> 50:41.204
-Tea.
-No, not that "cha."

50:42.914 --> 50:44.791
Well…

50:46.877 --> 50:48.170
What is that?

50:48.962 --> 50:51.131
A car. Honk, honk.

50:53.175 --> 50:54.342
All right.

50:55.135 --> 50:58.847
I didn't mean to ask for your help
time after time. Thank you so much.

50:59.556 --> 51:01.266
-Start your car.
-Sorry?

51:01.349 --> 51:02.976
-Try the ignition.
-Right.

51:09.649 --> 51:11.610
It's working. It started.

51:12.152 --> 51:13.403
-Move aside.
-What?

51:18.575 --> 51:19.534
What is it?

51:22.537 --> 51:23.371
Look.

51:24.456 --> 51:25.415
Do you see that?

51:28.502 --> 51:29.711
What's this?

51:30.962 --> 51:32.464
When did this happen?

51:33.340 --> 51:35.175
Did you drive all the way here

51:35.258 --> 51:37.385
with the tire-pressure warning lights on?

51:39.346 --> 51:42.265
Well, I was able
to drive all the way here.

51:42.349 --> 51:44.810
Don't you think
I'll be able to go back as well?

51:44.893 --> 51:46.520
Do you have nine lives?

51:46.603 --> 51:49.231
Get this fixed
at the repair shop in the morning.

51:49.314 --> 51:52.400
You're telling me to spend a night here?
Looking like this?

51:59.324 --> 52:01.201
There's a sauna across the harbor.

52:01.284 --> 52:03.245
It's 9,000 won for a night.

52:03.870 --> 52:05.372
Go there if you're interested.

52:06.540 --> 52:07.916
You do reek.

52:19.261 --> 52:20.887
I feel much better.

52:23.431 --> 52:24.432
SNACK BAR

52:24.516 --> 52:26.351
Bibimbap looks good.

52:26.852 --> 52:29.521
Rice cake dumpling soup
and <i>naengmyeon</i> sound good too.

52:34.568 --> 52:37.821
<i>I have 13,160 won left.</i>

52:37.904 --> 52:41.241
<i>I should put aside 10,000 won
just in case.</i>

52:41.867 --> 52:46.496
<i>Then the amount
I can spend here is only 3,160 won.</i>

52:50.500 --> 52:53.420
<i>I want eggs and sweet rice punch too.</i>

52:53.503 --> 52:57.632
<i>What should I have?
Eggs? Sweet rice punch?</i>

52:57.716 --> 52:59.634
<i>Eggs? Sweet rice punch?</i>

53:00.886 --> 53:02.387
<i>What am I doing right now?</i>

53:04.514 --> 53:06.516
One sweet rice punch, please.

53:06.600 --> 53:07.767
You really came.

53:10.520 --> 53:12.439
What? Why are you here?

53:12.522 --> 53:14.190
Can't you see? I'm working.

53:15.400 --> 53:16.276
Sweet rice punch?

53:16.359 --> 53:17.193
Yes.

53:23.074 --> 53:24.910
This is really annoying.

53:26.036 --> 53:27.871
I'm thankful for your help,

53:27.954 --> 53:29.247
but why are you talking casually to me?

53:30.165 --> 53:31.249
Okay what?

53:31.333 --> 53:34.169
I was about to tell you
to talk casually as well.

53:34.252 --> 53:35.253
It's fine by me.

53:37.005 --> 53:38.924
And talking casually has its own perks.

53:39.007 --> 53:42.260
I hate being so formal
only to make things get awkward.

53:42.344 --> 53:45.138
Being global is a trend nowadays.
Look at the foreigners.

53:45.221 --> 53:48.183
They call their parents-in-law
by their first names.

53:48.266 --> 53:49.184
It's much better.

53:50.477 --> 53:51.603
That's just ridiculous.

53:52.187 --> 53:53.229
Need anything else?

53:54.814 --> 53:56.232
I'm not that hungry.

54:00.612 --> 54:02.530
Your stomach is saying otherwise.

54:02.614 --> 54:04.240
I'm on a diet.

54:07.285 --> 54:08.954
Who ordered these eggs?

54:09.037 --> 54:11.957
<i>A fire broke out
at Hanguk Telecom in Chung-ho,</i>

54:12.040 --> 54:14.292
<i>and the entire Gongjin area
has been frozen.</i>

54:14.376 --> 54:16.920
-It's even on the news.
-<i>There have been issues…</i>

54:17.003 --> 54:20.465
-That's understandable.
-<i>Even the financial services were halted.</i>

54:20.548 --> 54:24.928
Who knew a fire at a telecom company
would leave me stranded here, penniless?

54:25.011 --> 54:27.973
<i>-It was put out around 7:30 p.m.</i>
-I miss Seoul.

54:28.556 --> 54:32.060
<i>The Chung-ho mayor promised
to fix this matter as soon as possible,</i>

54:32.143 --> 54:35.063
<i>look into the cause of the fire
to prevent similar incidents…</i>

54:42.320 --> 54:43.446
It's just a cricket.

54:52.455 --> 54:54.582
Chief Hong! Goodness!

54:54.666 --> 54:56.418
-What brings you here, Ms. Park?
-Hey!

54:56.501 --> 54:57.544
Are you here for me?

54:57.627 --> 55:00.338
I should go to Seoul
and move in with my daughter.

55:00.422 --> 55:02.007
I can't live here anymore.

55:02.090 --> 55:04.259
What is it this time?

55:04.342 --> 55:08.138
I'm 70, but I have to run errands
since I'm the youngest around here.

55:08.763 --> 55:11.933
Go to Gam-ri's place! She's hurt!

55:12.017 --> 55:13.768
Hurry up!

55:13.852 --> 55:15.770
-Grandma!
-What?

55:16.938 --> 55:19.149
Grandma. Gosh.

55:19.232 --> 55:22.027
You were fine just earlier.
What on earth happened?

55:22.110 --> 55:26.781
I'm going deaf because
you yell at me all the time like that.

55:26.865 --> 55:28.199
Where are you hurt?

55:28.283 --> 55:30.452
Here. She hurt her ankle.

55:30.535 --> 55:32.787
-Your ankle? Let me see.
-Yes.

55:32.871 --> 55:36.041
Gosh, it's swollen. Does it hurt to move?

55:36.124 --> 55:40.754
It's not a big deal.
I just sprained it a bit.

55:40.837 --> 55:44.632
You're unbelievable.
Why would you hang your laundry there?

55:44.716 --> 55:48.094
Are you a cat? Why would you
climb over the wall at night?

55:48.178 --> 55:49.804
-Gosh.
-That's enough.

55:49.888 --> 55:50.889
The wall?

55:52.348 --> 55:53.933
Get on. Let's go to the hospital.

55:57.270 --> 55:59.355
You should get an X-ray.

55:59.439 --> 56:01.399
I don't need that.

56:01.483 --> 56:03.276
I didn't break any bones.

56:04.736 --> 56:07.697
Gosh, you're so stubborn.

56:07.781 --> 56:09.616
I agree.

56:09.699 --> 56:12.744
I hope you become filthy rich
being stingy like that.

56:12.827 --> 56:14.913
I don't get why you're so stingy.

56:14.996 --> 56:18.291
-Gosh, I'm so frustrated.
-Aren't you going home?

56:19.084 --> 56:21.044
-I am. I am now.
-Go.

56:23.338 --> 56:25.423
-Good night.
-Gosh.

56:27.759 --> 56:28.885
Let me see.

56:35.100 --> 56:37.268
Must you use an ice pack?

56:37.352 --> 56:41.356
You should ice a sprain
right away to ease swelling.

56:41.439 --> 56:43.775
-What's wrong? Is it too cold?
-No.

56:44.275 --> 56:46.277
It's just slightly chilly.

56:46.861 --> 56:50.698
Are you feeling cold, my dear Gam-ri?
Do you want me to hug you?

56:52.325 --> 56:56.704
A grown man like you
shouldn't make such jokes.

56:57.789 --> 56:59.749
Stay in the room for tonight.

56:59.833 --> 57:03.378
I brought a chamber pot here,
so don't go out to the bathroom.

57:03.461 --> 57:05.922
But I need to go to the senior center.

57:06.005 --> 57:08.341
Don't be absurd. You're hurt.

57:08.424 --> 57:10.135
I'll be bored here by myself.

57:10.218 --> 57:11.928
I should go watch a soap opera.

57:12.011 --> 57:14.139
-You have a TV.
-By myself? That's no fun.

57:14.222 --> 57:16.724
-Then watch with me.
-Forget it.

57:16.808 --> 57:19.227
You don't even know the plot.

57:20.645 --> 57:23.022
-Gosh.
-They're all the same.

57:26.818 --> 57:27.902
Am I heavy?

57:28.695 --> 57:29.696
Yes.

57:30.738 --> 57:33.616
They say as you get old,
you become lighter.

57:33.700 --> 57:36.536
But seeing how heavy you are,
you must be still young.

57:37.495 --> 57:41.040
You're going to be punished
for teasing an oldie like me.

57:42.250 --> 57:47.046
Anyway, I feel bad for having you here.
You're not even getting paid.

57:47.130 --> 57:50.216
You're right. I was going
to go home and rest.

57:51.593 --> 57:54.262
You shouldn't have come.

57:55.263 --> 57:56.848
I'm returning the favor.

57:58.141 --> 58:01.561
Ever since my grandpa
passed away, you've fed me

58:01.644 --> 58:03.480
at least 999 meals.

58:04.189 --> 58:05.648
What choice did I have?

58:06.232 --> 58:09.152
I couldn't let
a kid left all alone starve.

58:09.235 --> 58:10.320
Still.

58:11.446 --> 58:12.572
I'm grateful.

58:14.240 --> 58:16.034
So even after I clock out,

58:16.576 --> 58:18.786
I'll always run over if you need me.

58:18.870 --> 58:20.705
Always?

58:21.289 --> 58:23.875
Then you're like the genie to me?

58:23.958 --> 58:27.253
Yes, I am. I'm like a wish-granting genie

58:27.337 --> 58:31.257
that you can summon
by rubbing the magic lamp.

58:32.258 --> 58:34.594
Is that even possible?

58:35.512 --> 58:37.222
Yes, it is.

58:38.890 --> 58:41.059
I must be so heavy.

58:41.142 --> 58:44.312
No, you're as light as a feather.

58:44.395 --> 58:45.396
Gosh.

58:45.980 --> 58:48.233
Oh, dear.

58:48.733 --> 58:50.109
All right.

58:50.193 --> 58:52.278
-Goodness.
-Heave.

58:52.362 --> 58:56.241
I can't believe I sprained my ankle.

58:56.324 --> 58:58.535
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes?

58:58.618 --> 59:00.453
Don't be sick.

59:00.954 --> 59:03.122
It's really nothing.

59:03.206 --> 59:06.960
-Still.
-It's only a mild sprain. Stop nagging.

59:17.053 --> 59:20.306
Do they not clean?
I can't believe there's a bug indoors.

59:29.524 --> 59:31.818
Well, there are many stars.

59:44.747 --> 59:45.748
Mom.

59:47.292 --> 59:48.710
Happy birthday.

1:00:54.609 --> 1:00:59.197
All right. The auction will begin.
Get in line.

1:00:59.280 --> 1:01:01.240
Single file.

1:01:01.824 --> 1:01:04.285
We have two monkfish.

1:01:04.369 --> 1:01:08.247
They're so fresh. They're so plump.

1:01:08.331 --> 1:01:13.294
I see 64,000 won. I see 65,000 won.

1:01:13.378 --> 1:01:16.506
Number 351 bid 65,000 won.

1:01:17.131 --> 1:01:19.217
Okay. Sold!

1:01:19.300 --> 1:01:20.927
You've got it for cheap!

1:01:21.010 --> 1:01:24.514
We have two monkfish.

1:01:40.488 --> 1:01:41.948
You're an auctioneer?

1:01:42.031 --> 1:01:43.491
You must've slept well.

1:01:43.574 --> 1:01:46.160
You were working at the sauna last night.

1:01:46.244 --> 1:01:47.912
But today, you're working here?

1:01:48.579 --> 1:01:50.081
You're a fraud, aren't you?

1:01:50.581 --> 1:01:52.792
There's sleep in your eyes.
Did you even wash up?

1:01:54.043 --> 1:01:57.630
By the way,
is there an auto repair shop nearby?

1:01:57.714 --> 1:01:58.965
Of course.

1:01:59.048 --> 1:02:00.049
Where?

1:02:00.675 --> 1:02:03.553
I have to return
to Seoul today at all costs.

1:02:03.636 --> 1:02:05.555
Is it expensive to fix a tire?

1:02:06.055 --> 1:02:07.807
Will it cost more than 10,000 won?

1:02:07.890 --> 1:02:08.850
Hey.

1:02:09.434 --> 1:02:10.727
I'll wash up and go.

1:02:11.436 --> 1:02:13.938
Okay. Take your time.

1:02:15.231 --> 1:02:17.692
Is it expensive or not?

1:02:18.234 --> 1:02:21.195
-You're the slow type, aren't you?
-What do you mean?

1:02:21.279 --> 1:02:23.781
You're more dull-witted than I thought.

1:02:24.407 --> 1:02:28.077
You don't have to tell me where it is,
but don't pick a fight with me.

1:02:28.161 --> 1:02:29.537
How ridiculous.

1:02:30.580 --> 1:02:31.581
Hold on.

1:02:36.669 --> 1:02:40.757
-Hello?
<i>-Hello, is this Dr. Yoon Hye-jin?</i>

1:02:40.840 --> 1:02:42.049
This is she. Who is this?

1:02:44.552 --> 1:02:46.262
<i>I'm your next-door neighbor.</i>

1:02:46.929 --> 1:02:51.434
<i>You introduced me
to Hyeongsol Dental Clinic.</i>

1:02:51.517 --> 1:02:53.019
My, it works now.

1:02:53.561 --> 1:02:54.645
<i>Sorry?</i>

1:02:54.729 --> 1:02:56.439
Yes, I'm listening.

1:02:57.106 --> 1:02:58.608
How was the treatment?

1:02:58.691 --> 1:03:01.027
It was great, thanks to you.

1:03:01.110 --> 1:03:05.448
I wanted to thank you in person,
but I haven't seen you around lately.

1:03:05.531 --> 1:03:07.658
I see. I've been a bit busy.

1:03:07.742 --> 1:03:10.369
I see.

1:03:10.453 --> 1:03:13.623
I heard that
you and the new dentist are friends,

1:03:13.706 --> 1:03:17.418
<i>so I asked her for your number.</i>

1:03:17.502 --> 1:03:21.214
I see. May I ask why you called me?

1:03:21.798 --> 1:03:24.383
Dr. Yoon, thank you so much.

1:03:27.094 --> 1:03:31.265
My daughter paid for it
with her hard-earned money.

1:03:31.349 --> 1:03:35.019
As her mother,
I felt terrible about making her pay.

1:03:35.102 --> 1:03:38.189
But you made sure
they wouldn't rip me off.

1:03:38.272 --> 1:03:39.440
I'm truly thankful.

1:03:42.276 --> 1:03:45.071
<i>I'm sorry for calling
when you must be so busy.</i>

1:03:45.154 --> 1:03:48.115
I just wanted to express my gratitude.

1:03:48.199 --> 1:03:49.534
Thank you, Dr. Yoon.

1:03:51.244 --> 1:03:52.453
It's my pleasure.

1:03:52.954 --> 1:03:55.540
Good luck with the treatment.

1:03:55.623 --> 1:03:59.085
Okay. Thank you so much. Goodbye.

1:03:59.168 --> 1:04:00.628
<i>-Goodbye.</i>
-Goodbye.

1:04:04.465 --> 1:04:06.717
What a kind-hearted woman.

1:04:10.179 --> 1:04:12.515
Right, I should call the helpline.

1:04:20.815 --> 1:04:23.818
<i>Hye-jin, why is your phone off?</i>

1:04:23.901 --> 1:04:27.154
<i>You're not taking drastic measures
because you can't find a job, right?</i>

1:04:27.238 --> 1:04:30.116
<i>If I can't reach you by tomorrow,
I'm going to call the police.</i>

1:04:30.199 --> 1:04:32.994
Gosh, Mi-seon is terrifying
when she's worried.

1:04:34.579 --> 1:04:37.290
<i>I'm down south. Don't worry too much.</i>

1:04:37.373 --> 1:04:38.749
-Ma'am!
-Ma'am!

1:04:40.042 --> 1:04:42.587
Hey, the kids from yesterday.

1:04:42.670 --> 1:04:43.963
What was your names again?

1:04:44.046 --> 1:04:46.257
I'm Chang I-jun.

1:04:46.340 --> 1:04:48.885
I'm Choi Bo-ra. "Bo" as in boat,
and "ra" as in <i>ramyeon</i>.

1:04:49.468 --> 1:04:50.428
Right.

1:04:50.970 --> 1:04:53.973
Despite getting hit yesterday,
he still hangs out with you.

1:04:55.224 --> 1:04:58.603
That's because I'm his only friend here.

1:04:58.686 --> 1:05:00.938
That's not why.
I know she hit me by mistake.

1:05:01.981 --> 1:05:03.149
How kind of you.

1:05:03.774 --> 1:05:05.651
Can I take a look at your tooth?

1:05:06.235 --> 1:05:07.194
Sure.

1:05:07.278 --> 1:05:10.406
Open your mouth. It's healing well.

1:05:10.907 --> 1:05:13.284
If it feels loose again,
go to the dentist, okay?

1:05:14.160 --> 1:05:15.494
Okay.

1:05:15.578 --> 1:05:18.706
I will never ever forget
what you did for me yesterday.

1:05:19.332 --> 1:05:21.375
I will return the kindness no matter what.

1:05:21.459 --> 1:05:22.335
How old are you?

1:05:22.418 --> 1:05:23.961
We're both nine.

1:05:24.587 --> 1:05:26.464
But you know such difficult expressions?

1:05:26.547 --> 1:05:30.551
He knows over 100 expressions.
He even does calligraphy.

1:05:32.553 --> 1:05:34.221
You don't need to repay me.

1:05:34.305 --> 1:05:36.599
Just promise me you'll be healthy. Okay?

1:05:36.682 --> 1:05:38.351
Yes, ma'am.

1:05:38.434 --> 1:05:40.186
-You too.
-Okay.

1:05:40.770 --> 1:05:41.854
Go on, then.

1:05:44.899 --> 1:05:45.775
Ma'am.

1:05:45.858 --> 1:05:46.817
Yes?

1:05:47.652 --> 1:05:49.612
Thank you so much.

1:05:50.237 --> 1:05:51.656
I hope you visit us again.

1:05:53.324 --> 1:05:55.743
What? Okay.

1:05:55.826 --> 1:05:57.912
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1:05:57.995 --> 1:05:58.996
Let's go.

1:06:04.377 --> 1:06:05.252
How cute.

1:06:05.336 --> 1:06:06.796
All done.

1:06:06.879 --> 1:06:08.381
Oh, really?

1:06:11.926 --> 1:06:12.802
Thank you.

1:06:19.684 --> 1:06:21.477
-Du-sik.
-Hey.

1:06:21.560 --> 1:06:23.479
Thanks for opening the shop for me.

1:06:23.562 --> 1:06:26.190
Don't mention it.
I put the 4,000 won over there.

1:06:26.273 --> 1:06:27.650
-Four thousand won?
-Yes.

1:06:28.234 --> 1:06:29.610
What's this for?

1:06:29.694 --> 1:06:32.029
It's from that woman
who couldn't pay you yesterday.

1:06:33.030 --> 1:06:34.740
Ju-ri said both her bag

1:06:34.824 --> 1:06:37.535
and business card were fake.
I guess she's not a scammer.

1:06:37.618 --> 1:06:39.078
No, she isn't.

1:06:39.161 --> 1:06:40.204
How do you know?

1:06:40.287 --> 1:06:43.207
Well… I just know.

1:06:43.290 --> 1:06:45.292
You're smiling. Why?

1:06:47.503 --> 1:06:49.046
I'm always smiling.

1:06:50.673 --> 1:06:51.757
You're blushing.

1:06:52.425 --> 1:06:53.551
Coffee?

1:07:12.945 --> 1:07:13.904
Hello?

1:07:14.572 --> 1:07:15.573
<i>It's me.</i>

1:07:16.449 --> 1:07:17.616
Who is this?

1:07:17.700 --> 1:07:19.201
<i>You must've deleted my number.</i>

1:07:19.285 --> 1:07:21.537
<i>Still, have you already
forgotten my voice?</i>

1:07:23.622 --> 1:07:24.665
Dr. Lee?

1:07:24.749 --> 1:07:27.543
That's right. Have you been well?

1:07:27.626 --> 1:07:29.628
I heard you're working hard to land a job.

1:07:29.712 --> 1:07:31.922
Speak for yourself.

1:07:32.006 --> 1:07:35.885
I heard you worked hard to spread rumors
about me, so no one would hire me.

1:07:36.510 --> 1:07:38.262
Do you think that was me?

1:07:38.345 --> 1:07:41.432
Hye-jin, you're more naive than I thought.

1:07:42.058 --> 1:07:44.310
<i>I didn't have to do anything.</i>

1:07:44.393 --> 1:07:47.063
<i>The dental community
is very small and closed.</i>

1:07:47.146 --> 1:07:51.025
Who would want to hire a whistleblower
who badmouthed their chief doctor

1:07:51.108 --> 1:07:52.777
while brazenly disclosing her name?

1:07:52.860 --> 1:07:55.613
No one will hire you.

1:07:56.197 --> 1:07:58.741
<i>In that sense, let me make you an offer.</i>

1:07:59.283 --> 1:08:02.953
Kneel in front of me
and beg for my forgiveness.

1:08:04.246 --> 1:08:06.832
<i>Then I'll have pity on you
and take you back.</i>

1:08:07.333 --> 1:08:08.209
Kneel?

1:08:09.668 --> 1:08:12.546
Don't be absurd. Why would I work
for a quack like you again?

1:08:12.630 --> 1:08:15.758
What, a quack?
I don't think you understand--

1:08:15.841 --> 1:08:19.220
Forget it. Do you think
I must be hired at some clinic?

1:08:19.303 --> 1:08:20.596
I'll open my own.

1:08:20.679 --> 1:08:22.515
I'll run my own clinic!

1:08:24.725 --> 1:08:26.310
What a lunatic.

1:08:37.321 --> 1:08:40.324
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

1:08:43.494 --> 1:08:45.913
Ma'am.

1:08:47.915 --> 1:08:50.376
Hello. You're still here?

1:08:50.459 --> 1:08:53.129
You told me to come
if I was ever interested.

1:08:53.212 --> 1:08:54.213
Sorry?

1:08:54.797 --> 1:08:56.257
I'm going to open a clinic here.

1:08:56.340 --> 1:08:57.883
What? Seriously?

1:08:57.967 --> 1:09:00.886
Yes. I've made up my mind.

1:09:00.970 --> 1:09:02.847
I'm glad to hear that.

1:09:02.930 --> 1:09:05.015
Hold on. Let me see.

1:09:05.724 --> 1:09:07.143
Let's go to the realtor.

1:09:08.060 --> 1:09:09.854
No, this would be faster.

1:09:13.816 --> 1:09:14.984
Follow me.

1:09:26.745 --> 1:09:29.498
-So you slept at a sauna?
-Yes.

1:09:29.582 --> 1:09:31.625
You should've come to my house.

1:09:32.376 --> 1:09:34.295
Thank you for offering.

1:09:37.131 --> 1:09:41.635
By the way, does the realtor
live this high up?

1:09:41.719 --> 1:09:44.180
We're not meeting a realtor right now.

1:09:46.515 --> 1:09:49.310
Why is this loser calling me? Hold on.

1:09:49.393 --> 1:09:50.728
VILLAGE CHIEF CHANG YEONG-GUK

1:09:51.645 --> 1:09:53.105
Hello? What is it?

1:09:53.772 --> 1:09:57.943
What? You want to change
the date for the elderly party?

1:09:58.027 --> 1:09:59.528
Of course, you can't!

1:10:00.321 --> 1:10:02.948
We even did a survey
to decide on the date.

1:10:03.532 --> 1:10:07.077
I don't want to hear it.
I'll be right there, so just wait.

1:10:08.829 --> 1:10:12.124
Look. I'm sorry, but there's an emergency.

1:10:12.708 --> 1:10:14.710
Then what should I do?

1:10:14.793 --> 1:10:18.923
Go straight up this path,
and you'll see a boat on top.

1:10:19.006 --> 1:10:20.424
Go there.

1:10:20.507 --> 1:10:23.052
I already called him,
so he'll recognize you.

1:10:23.594 --> 1:10:25.804
-Call whom?
-I'm sorry.

1:10:25.888 --> 1:10:28.140
I need to go give him a good beating.

1:10:28.807 --> 1:10:31.352
-You should give me his number at least.
-Go.

1:10:47.868 --> 1:10:48.994
I'm so tired.

1:10:49.954 --> 1:10:50.955
Gosh.

1:10:51.705 --> 1:10:53.249
There really is a boat.

1:10:53.332 --> 1:10:56.001
Who put this here on top of a hill?

1:10:57.836 --> 1:10:59.672
It must be him.

1:11:00.839 --> 1:11:02.174
Excuse…

1:11:04.468 --> 1:11:06.011
Hey, we meet again.

1:11:08.764 --> 1:11:11.016
What? Why are you here?

1:11:11.100 --> 1:11:12.476
A clinic and a house?

1:11:12.559 --> 1:11:15.854
Were you the one she was talking about?

1:11:15.938 --> 1:11:18.524
Yes. For your information,
I'm not a fraud.

1:11:21.902 --> 1:11:23.654
REAL ESTATE AGENT
HONG DU-SIK

1:11:25.531 --> 1:11:26.949
What do you really do?

1:11:29.618 --> 1:11:31.453
What on earth is your deal?

1:11:31.537 --> 1:11:32.746
Me?

1:11:33.497 --> 1:11:34.623
I'm Chief Hong.

1:12:50.532 --> 1:12:52.201
Sit down here.

1:12:52.284 --> 1:12:53.827
PHARMACY

1:12:55.204 --> 1:12:56.747
Okay. Open your mouth.

1:12:56.830 --> 1:12:57.998
Open.

1:12:58.082 --> 1:13:00.876
Goodness. It's bleeding.

1:13:12.054 --> 1:13:13.347
What?

1:13:14.223 --> 1:13:15.224
Look.

1:13:15.766 --> 1:13:18.102
-What?
-Didn't I do well?

1:14:08.193 --> 1:14:10.362
Am I the only one
who finds this suspicious?

1:14:10.446 --> 1:14:13.615
<i>I'm on government payroll, you see.</i>

1:14:13.699 --> 1:14:15.409
Chief Hong is a regular chief.

1:14:15.492 --> 1:14:17.161
<i>Don't you need renovating?</i>

1:14:17.244 --> 1:14:18.745
<i>I do that for minimum wage too.</i>

1:14:18.829 --> 1:14:22.749
<i>You're not scamming me
because I'm not from around here, right?</i>

1:14:22.833 --> 1:14:25.043
Was she really a dentist?

1:14:25.127 --> 1:14:26.295
She's pretty.

1:14:26.378 --> 1:14:28.380
<i>Please stop by even though you're busy.</i>

1:14:28.464 --> 1:14:30.674
And promote the opening of your clinic.

1:14:30.757 --> 1:14:34.678
<i>In a yard where dirt is kicked up,
they grill meat, boil soup, and sing.</i>

1:14:35.554 --> 1:14:37.639
<i>You think you're better than everyone.</i>

1:14:37.723 --> 1:14:40.601
<i>Look here, Doctor.</i>

1:14:40.684 --> 1:14:42.519
<i>Life isn't so fair for all of us.</i>

1:14:43.103 --> 1:14:44.271
<i>Got that?</i>

1:14:45.314 --> 1:14:50.319
