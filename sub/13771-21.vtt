00:01.871 --> 00:04.091
So, if Rex Huntington
is the finest doctor

00:04.178 --> 00:05.483
in Spring Valley, why is he

00:05.570 --> 00:06.832
defending Jessica
in the murder trial?

00:06.919 --> 00:08.573
Because, before
he got pushed

00:08.660 --> 00:10.271
off the mountain
and got amnesia,

00:10.358 --> 00:12.403
he was the finest lawyer
in Spring Valley.

00:12.490 --> 00:13.796
What I can't believe

00:13.883 --> 00:15.232
is Jessica is having
an affair with the judge.

00:15.319 --> 00:17.191
I mean, he's
totally using her

00:17.278 --> 00:20.020
to get his hands
on the Farnsworth fortune.

00:20.107 --> 00:21.369
You can't ground me!

00:21.456 --> 00:23.371
That fire could have
been started by anybody!

00:23.458 --> 00:24.894
Why don't you
ever take my side?!

00:24.981 --> 00:26.461
You never listen
anything I say!

00:29.812 --> 00:30.726
You know, Reese,

00:30.813 --> 00:32.162
some very manly men

00:32.249 --> 00:34.121
watch soap operas

MR. FLERCH: If you are
diligent in your efforts,

01:14.335 --> 01:17.338
you will find
that our spring project

01:17.425 --> 01:19.862
will develop
your fine motor skills

01:19.949 --> 01:22.082
and powers of concentration.

01:23.648 --> 01:25.085
Also, it will teach you

01:25.172 --> 01:27.391
a vocation that may, one day,

01:27.478 --> 01:30.655
lead you to a life
of semi-independence.

01:31.569 --> 01:32.788
Hello, class.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.224
Hello, Principal Jeffers.

01:34.311 --> 01:36.313
You've come
at a very exciting time.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.881
We're about to open a new box
of key clips.

01:38.968 --> 01:41.057
And how are we
all today, students?

01:41.144 --> 01:43.581
I know no one gives a crap
about the kids in this class,

01:43.668 --> 01:45.017
but could you get us some books

01:45.105 --> 01:46.802
so we could actually
learn something?

01:46.889 --> 01:48.412
The only thing we've done here

01:48.499 --> 01:50.675
for the last ten weeks
is make lanyards!

01:50.762 --> 01:53.243
You know what subject
I hated most

01:53.330 --> 01:55.115
when I was a kid? Math.

01:57.247 --> 01:59.989
Dewey, I need you
to re-sort my pills again.

02:00.076 --> 02:01.208
I just finished sorting them.

02:01.295 --> 02:02.383
It took me a half hour.

02:02.470 --> 02:04.341
I know. But then I unsorted them

02:04.428 --> 02:07.736
so I could see if I could
sort them by myself. I can't.

02:07.823 --> 02:10.520
All right. Just don't
touch them anymore.

02:10.608 --> 02:12.697
I'll do it with you
after school.

02:12.784 --> 02:14.656
Dewey, I need your help
after school.

02:14.743 --> 02:15.744
I'm already helping Hansen.

02:15.831 --> 02:17.311
But I need you!

02:17.398 --> 02:18.442
The sidewalks told me
they wouldn't let me

02:18.529 --> 02:19.269
walk home anymore.

02:19.356 --> 02:21.750
Can you...

02:21.837 --> 02:24.883
Okay, just wait till I'm done,
then I'll walk you home.

02:24.970 --> 02:27.364
But, seriously,
you guys have to start trying

02:27.451 --> 02:29.366
to do a little more
for yourselves.

02:29.453 --> 02:30.889
Oh, that reminds me.

02:30.976 --> 02:33.805
My uncle died,
and my parents were wondering

02:33.892 --> 02:35.981
if you'd explain death to me.

02:41.422 --> 02:43.250
Are you studying?

02:43.337 --> 02:46.122
Yeah. My stupid teachers wait
until the end of my senior year

02:46.209 --> 02:47.689
to tell me I have final exams.

02:47.776 --> 02:49.212
In every single class!

02:49.299 --> 02:50.866
I've got to get serious now.

02:50.953 --> 02:52.868
If the finals are anything
like this practice test,

02:52.955 --> 02:54.174
it's gonna be brutal.

02:54.261 --> 02:56.480
It's just a bunch
of true/false questions.

02:56.567 --> 02:57.568
So it's a 50-50 chance.

02:57.655 --> 02:59.004
Do you know what the odds are

02:59.091 --> 03:00.571
of getting one of those right?

03:01.703 --> 03:04.662
$23 for the Neighborhood
Association.

03:04.749 --> 03:06.316
The annual meeting
is tomorrow night.

03:06.403 --> 03:07.448
It's been a year already?

03:07.535 --> 03:09.058
Those people are relentless.

03:09.145 --> 03:11.321
You think, if we showed up once,
they'd stop inviting us?

03:11.408 --> 03:12.888
That's always been the pattern.

03:12.975 --> 03:14.759
Well, don't worry.
You have a good excuse.

03:14.846 --> 03:16.805
Tomorrow you're cleaning the
dead possum out of the chimney.

03:16.892 --> 03:18.981
The smell has gotten
so bad, I can't tell

03:19.068 --> 03:20.939
when Jamie needs
changing anymore.

03:21.026 --> 03:22.463
You know, if we just
wait a few more weeks,

03:22.550 --> 03:23.681
it'll disintegrate
on its own.

03:23.768 --> 03:24.943
Tomorrow, Hal.

03:25.030 --> 03:27.859
I'm sick of all
those crows on the roof.

03:27.946 --> 03:28.773
Hey, Dad.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.166
What? Wait.

03:30.253 --> 03:32.168
You think patriotism
is a joke?!

03:32.255 --> 03:35.302
Representative government
is an outdated sham?

03:35.389 --> 03:37.086
I can't believe my ears!

03:37.173 --> 03:38.130
What are you talking about?

03:38.218 --> 03:39.044
What did he say?

03:39.131 --> 03:40.132
I can't even repeat it.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.525
I'm sorry, Lois,

03:41.612 --> 03:42.918
but the chimney will
just have to wait.

03:43.005 --> 03:44.441
I'm taking Malcolm
to the Neighborhood

03:44.528 --> 03:45.834
Association meeting.

03:45.921 --> 03:48.184
Let's hope seeing
democracy in action

03:48.271 --> 03:50.099
will give our little cynic
a wake-up call.

03:52.319 --> 03:53.972
[phone rings]

03:54.059 --> 03:56.758
Chad, I have to finish
correcting everyone's homework.

03:56.845 --> 03:58.760
It's been in your mouth
a half an hour.

03:58.847 --> 04:00.501
Either spit it out
or swallow it.

04:00.588 --> 04:01.589
Dewey?

04:01.676 --> 04:02.546
Oh, hey, Francis.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.026
You want to talk to Mom?

04:04.113 --> 04:05.332
No. I called to talk to you.

04:05.419 --> 04:06.942
Me? Really?

04:07.029 --> 04:09.031
Yeah. Listen.

04:09.118 --> 04:11.251
I'm up for a job as activities
director at a summer camp,

04:11.338 --> 04:12.687
but I have to show them

04:12.774 --> 04:14.036
what kind of program
I can put together.

04:14.123 --> 04:15.080
I need you to help me.

04:15.167 --> 04:16.255
You want my help?

04:16.343 --> 04:17.909
Yeah. I have all these

04:17.995 --> 04:18.997
great ideas for games,

04:19.084 --> 04:19.998
so I'm gonna come home tomorrow

04:20.084 --> 04:21.478
so I can play them with you.

04:21.565 --> 04:23.219
You know, to make sure
they're fun enough.

04:23.306 --> 04:24.655
So how does that sound?

04:24.742 --> 04:26.614
Like a setup
for a cruel practical joke,

04:26.701 --> 04:28.485
but I'm willing
to take the risk.

04:32.707 --> 04:34.709
Excuse me.

04:34.796 --> 04:35.797
We're here for
the homeowners meeting.

04:35.884 --> 04:37.755
Oh, my God! Really?

04:37.842 --> 04:39.061
Oh!

04:39.148 --> 04:42.978
Oh, that's fantastic!

04:43.065 --> 04:44.762
Jim Phipps.

04:44.849 --> 04:46.634
I'm the association's
attorney.

04:46.721 --> 04:48.157
So... where is everyone?

04:48.244 --> 04:50.377
Well, I kind of am everyone.

04:50.464 --> 04:51.726
No one's ever shown up

04:51.813 --> 04:54.424
for a homeowners meeting
in 20 years.

04:54.511 --> 04:56.034
You're kidding.
Not one person?

04:56.121 --> 04:58.472
Not one, not one.

04:58.559 --> 05:00.517
I send out 150 flyers
every year,

05:00.604 --> 05:02.867
exactly as mandated
by the developer,

05:02.954 --> 05:04.652
but nobody ever comes.

05:04.739 --> 05:07.959
I've tried different fonts,
I've upgraded the doughnuts,

05:08.046 --> 05:10.832
but people just don't
seem to be interested.

05:10.919 --> 05:12.399
So, every year,
you rent a room,

05:12.486 --> 05:13.704
and hold a meeting
for nobody?

05:13.791 --> 05:15.227
Oh, absolutely.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.274
My contract with the developer
is very clear.

05:18.361 --> 05:20.885
In exchange for
a $2,000 annual retainer,

05:20.972 --> 05:24.106
I'm to conduct annual meetings,
take the minutes,

05:24.193 --> 05:27.327
and manage the association's
financial interests.

05:27.414 --> 05:28.458
Financial interests?

05:28.545 --> 05:30.330
Well, actually,
there aren't any.

05:30.417 --> 05:33.115
I didn't mean to come off
so self-important.

05:33.202 --> 05:35.944
Only the homeowners can
decide where the money goes,

05:36.031 --> 05:39.121
so I've just been putting
the dues in a savings account.

05:39.208 --> 05:40.514
The bank gave me a toaster

05:40.601 --> 05:44.082
in 1987-- I never
even opened the box.

05:45.170 --> 05:46.694
So... 150 homes paying

05:46.781 --> 05:48.435
23 bucks over 20 years,

05:48.522 --> 05:49.871
passbook interest,

05:49.958 --> 05:51.786
minus the retainer...

05:51.873 --> 05:54.136
Oh, my God!
If my math is right,

05:54.223 --> 05:57.487
he's sitting
on at least $83,000!

05:57.574 --> 05:59.837
Who am I kidding?
Of course my math is right.

05:59.924 --> 06:02.797
You know, it sure would
be nice to have someone

06:02.884 --> 06:05.234
finally take charge
of this thing.

06:05.321 --> 06:07.758
Would you ever consider
being president

06:07.845 --> 06:09.934
of the neighborhood
association?

06:10.021 --> 06:10.892
I don't think so.

06:10.979 --> 06:12.197
It sounds like... work.

06:12.284 --> 06:14.156
Dad, what are
you talking about?

06:14.243 --> 06:15.462
Of course you want
to be president!

06:15.549 --> 06:16.898
This is your chance

06:16.985 --> 06:18.421
to really do something
for the community.

06:18.508 --> 06:19.857
-I don't think...
-You can't turn this down.

06:19.944 --> 06:21.598
You've always told me
that a real citizen

06:21.685 --> 06:22.860
is willing to
make sacrifices

06:22.947 --> 06:24.209
for the greater good.

06:24.296 --> 06:25.602
That doesn't sound like...

06:25.689 --> 06:27.604
And I took those
words to heart!

06:27.691 --> 06:29.127
They inspired me.

06:29.214 --> 06:30.955
And now I have a chance
to see my own dad

06:31.042 --> 06:32.740
show me what democracy
is all about.

06:32.827 --> 06:34.002
You can't deny me that.

06:34.089 --> 06:35.699
-Well...
-It's not just for me.

06:35.786 --> 06:37.179
It's for our family,

06:37.266 --> 06:39.703
our block, the whole
neighborhood!

06:39.790 --> 06:41.618
Think of all the people
you could help.

06:41.705 --> 06:44.969
The world is waiting for you
to make it a better place!

06:45.056 --> 06:48.059
Well... okay. I'll do it.

06:48.146 --> 06:50.540
Finally!

06:50.627 --> 06:52.368
This is exactly the reason

06:52.455 --> 06:54.936
I went into zoning law.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.523
I don't see how this helps.

07:16.610 --> 07:18.263
Where's Dewey?

07:18.350 --> 07:21.223
When I was his age,
I was out of school hours ago.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.051
Doing independent study...

07:23.138 --> 07:25.314
at the library...
not smoking.

07:25.401 --> 07:27.534
So, it's exciting
about the job.

07:27.621 --> 07:29.536
Yeah. It's been
a long hunt,

07:29.623 --> 07:31.102
but it finally paid off.

07:31.189 --> 07:32.626
Don't you have to have
some kind of degree

07:32.713 --> 07:34.149
or something
to work with children?

07:34.236 --> 07:36.630
You never think anything
I ever do is good enough!

07:36.717 --> 07:38.414
I happened to do very well
at that interview.

07:38.501 --> 07:40.111
All I have to do now
is just show them

07:40.198 --> 07:42.374
that I can put together
a good program for the summer.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.985
So you don't have the job.

07:44.072 --> 07:45.813
I have the job!

07:45.900 --> 07:46.901
What don't you understand
about that?!

07:46.988 --> 07:48.685
I don't know.

07:48.772 --> 07:49.947
It just sounds like the real
estate thing all over again.

07:50.034 --> 07:51.340
Why can't you just
have faith in me

07:51.427 --> 07:52.950
for once?!

07:53.037 --> 07:55.083
Gin. Want to play again?

07:55.170 --> 07:56.954
Sure. You know who's hiring?

07:57.041 --> 07:59.043
I have a job!

08:00.654 --> 08:01.785
I am appalled.

08:01.872 --> 08:04.266
This completion
stitch is kinked.

08:04.353 --> 08:05.354
Young lady,

08:05.441 --> 08:07.748
if you neglect your education,

08:07.835 --> 08:11.099
you deny yourself
the keys to success.

08:12.448 --> 08:13.797
[bell rings]

08:13.884 --> 08:15.625
-Dewey, wait!
-I can't.

08:15.712 --> 08:17.235
I have to get home
to see my brother.

08:17.322 --> 08:18.454
But I need you to help me

08:18.541 --> 08:20.238
with the algebra problems
you gave me.

08:20.325 --> 08:23.111
I went over those problems
20 times!

08:23.198 --> 08:24.460
But my head
passed through a magnet,

08:24.547 --> 08:25.548
and I think
I forgot everything.

08:33.164 --> 08:35.166
I'm sorry! I can't!

08:36.211 --> 08:38.866
I can't do this anymore.

08:40.650 --> 08:41.956
I'm sorry.

08:42.043 --> 08:43.610
It's okay, Dewey.

08:43.697 --> 08:45.481
We understand.

08:45.568 --> 08:48.266
Yeah. Go have fun
with your brother.

08:48.353 --> 08:49.964
We'll be fine.

08:54.490 --> 08:57.754
Everyone turn in
their assignments.

08:57.841 --> 08:59.539
I have to take
this one home with me.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.453
It doesn't believe
that I have a cat.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.325
It is 3:00.

09:03.412 --> 09:06.197
It is now time
to clear your area!

09:06.284 --> 09:07.895
-[Chad grunting]
-I don't think you want

09:07.982 --> 09:09.897
to do anything physical
with Chad.

09:09.984 --> 09:11.028
Do not test me, young man.

09:11.115 --> 09:13.117
I am an educator
who is not afraid

09:13.204 --> 09:14.466
to use discipline.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.033
Ow!

09:18.383 --> 09:22.126
All right. Now it's a matter
for the police.

09:22.997 --> 09:25.260
-Dewey! What do we do?
-He's not here.

09:25.347 --> 09:26.609
Somebody do something!

09:26.696 --> 09:28.002
[students murmuring]

09:28.089 --> 09:29.220
[phone dialing]

09:32.833 --> 09:35.705
Excuse me, Mr. Flerch?

09:37.141 --> 09:38.578
[muffled yelling]

09:40.797 --> 09:43.017
Well, I think,
of the three ideas we had,

09:43.104 --> 09:45.193
this was the best.

09:50.807 --> 09:51.939
I win!

09:52.026 --> 09:53.462
Good job.

09:53.549 --> 09:55.986
Okay, Dewey, of all
the things we did today,

09:56.073 --> 09:57.901
what seemed like
it could be more fun?

09:57.988 --> 10:01.426
The rainbow obstacle course
or the tickle maze

10:01.513 --> 10:03.428
or the shower
of lollipops?

10:03.515 --> 10:05.648
Honest to God,
it was all fantastic.

10:05.735 --> 10:07.694
It was by far
the best day of my life.

10:07.781 --> 10:10.522
I can make you happier.

10:12.176 --> 10:14.788
"President, comma,

10:14.875 --> 10:17.442
Newcastle Adjacent
Neighborhood Association."

10:17.529 --> 10:19.227
Hal, that is so fancy.

10:19.314 --> 10:20.141
Feel the little duck.

10:20.228 --> 10:21.751
-That's embossed.
-Wow.

10:21.838 --> 10:24.449
How's my little bureaucrat?

10:24.536 --> 10:25.799
Fantastic.

10:25.886 --> 10:27.104
I'm just finishing up
the details

10:27.191 --> 10:28.062
on all the neighborhood
initiatives

10:28.149 --> 10:29.019
you've been talking about.

10:29.106 --> 10:30.542
I was?

10:30.630 --> 10:34.329
Yeah. Remember you said,
"I hope I do a good job"?

10:34.416 --> 10:35.896
Obviously that means
structural improvements:

10:35.983 --> 10:37.332
like installing lights
at the basketball court

10:37.419 --> 10:38.942
and building a skate park

10:39.029 --> 10:41.684
and Friday night dance parties
with a killer DJ.

10:41.771 --> 10:43.164
Isn't that kind of expensive?

10:43.251 --> 10:44.992
You have to think of it
as an investment.

10:45.079 --> 10:46.907
It's actually expensive
not to do it.

10:46.994 --> 10:49.910
There's $87,000
in the account? Wow.

10:49.997 --> 10:51.607
Well, a lot of it
gets eaten up

10:51.694 --> 10:53.261
servicing
the infrastructure.

10:53.348 --> 10:55.219
Like, there's no point
in having a DJ

10:55.306 --> 10:57.569
if you're not going to have
a really rocking sound system.

10:57.657 --> 10:58.875
Why don't we just give
the homeowners a refund check?

10:58.962 --> 11:00.485
We could.

11:00.572 --> 11:02.574
But we wouldn't have the money
for what you said

11:02.662 --> 11:04.185
was the most important
thing-- security.

11:04.272 --> 11:05.795
Security's big.

11:05.882 --> 11:07.841
I've been racking my brain,
trying to find a way

11:07.928 --> 11:09.669
to give every area
equal protection.

11:09.756 --> 11:10.974
I wish there was

11:11.061 --> 11:13.890
some magic kind
of mobile security system

11:13.977 --> 11:15.370
that could weave
through the neighborhood.

11:15.457 --> 11:16.980
Like a security car?

11:17.067 --> 11:18.416
Dad, that's brilliant!

11:18.503 --> 11:20.070
And then citizens
from the neighborhood

11:20.157 --> 11:21.376
could drive the car around
to make sure

11:21.463 --> 11:22.899
-there's no trouble.
-I don't know.

11:22.986 --> 11:24.901
Purchasing a car isn't
the only expense.

11:24.988 --> 11:26.424
You got to think
about storage fees--

11:26.511 --> 11:29.689
Wait, we could park it
at our house.

11:29.776 --> 11:32.126
You have a real talent
for this.

11:41.352 --> 11:42.702
Hey, it's almost lunchtime.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.529
Where's Flerch?

11:44.616 --> 11:46.183
I don't know.

11:46.270 --> 11:47.445
You'd think
he'd be here by now,

11:47.532 --> 11:49.273
but he definitely isn't.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.188
I know.
I'm so fed up,

11:51.275 --> 11:52.581
I don't even think
it's worth complaining about.

11:52.668 --> 11:54.278
-BOY: Me, neither.
-GIRL: Yeah!

11:54.365 --> 11:56.585
Listen, guys, I'm sorry
I blew up at you yesterday.

11:56.672 --> 11:58.282
I guess I just kind
of needed a break.

11:58.369 --> 11:59.806
Forget it, Dewey.

11:59.893 --> 12:02.243
We need to start doing things
on our own.

12:02.330 --> 12:03.548
And you know what?

12:03.635 --> 12:04.941
I think we're
already doing things

12:05.028 --> 12:06.682
we didn't think
we were capable of.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.254
3,081.

12:13.341 --> 12:15.735
Did you pull an all-nighter?

12:15.822 --> 12:17.649
Yeah. Math.
I kept getting confused,

12:17.737 --> 12:19.956
so I'm making a list
of all the numbers.

12:20.043 --> 12:25.005
3,082.

12:25.092 --> 12:27.355
Where do they stop?

12:27.442 --> 12:28.704
The state-of-the-art

12:28.791 --> 12:30.271
rehearsal studio
is essentially free,

12:30.358 --> 12:32.055
because once the garage band
makes it big,

12:32.142 --> 12:34.405
the community gets ten percent
of the record sales.

12:34.492 --> 12:36.016
So it's basically the same
business model

12:36.103 --> 12:37.713
-as the extreme sports camp?
-Yes.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.628
[doorbell rings]

12:39.715 --> 12:41.064
So, did you get a chance
to go through my proposal

12:41.151 --> 12:42.500
for a girls' volleyball
tournament?

12:42.587 --> 12:44.372
Well...

12:44.459 --> 12:45.416
Jim, what are you doing here?

12:45.503 --> 12:46.809
I had to share this with you.

12:46.896 --> 12:49.116
-What is it?
-I was so inspired

12:49.203 --> 12:51.379
by what your son said,

12:51.466 --> 12:53.903
that I went beyond the
requirements of my retainer

12:53.990 --> 12:57.254
and wrote a new constitution for
the Neighborhood Association.

12:57.341 --> 12:59.822
Pro bono, of course.

12:59.909 --> 13:02.956
It's designed so that
everyone in the community

13:03.043 --> 13:05.349
will have an equal voice
in all decisions.

13:05.436 --> 13:08.570
I think it'll really
get people participating.

13:08.657 --> 13:11.442
That sounds great, Jim.
Thanks.

13:11.529 --> 13:13.531
No, thank you for showing up
at that meeting

13:13.618 --> 13:17.274
and making me believe again.

13:17.361 --> 13:19.189
[chuckles]

13:21.539 --> 13:22.366
What a jerk.

13:22.453 --> 13:24.412
What? Why?

13:24.499 --> 13:26.109
Coming in here with his agenda

13:26.196 --> 13:28.155
like you're not doing
a fantastic job when you are.

13:28.242 --> 13:29.504
I think he just wants

13:29.591 --> 13:31.245
the voice of the people
to be heard.

13:31.332 --> 13:33.160
You are the voice
of the people.

13:33.247 --> 13:34.509
You're the one
with the vision.

13:34.596 --> 13:35.858
You're the one
with the amazing ideas

13:35.945 --> 13:37.425
tumbling out of you
every second.

13:37.512 --> 13:39.079
Maybe not every second.

13:39.166 --> 13:40.471
Yes.

13:40.558 --> 13:42.952
Your brain
is like a factory of ideas.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.998
Please do not close
the factory.

13:45.085 --> 13:47.478
You know, sometimes
it feels like a factory.

13:47.565 --> 13:48.871
Of course it does.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.612
You are the leader
of this community.

13:50.699 --> 13:53.397
Everybody recognizes it
and they love you for it.

13:53.484 --> 13:55.835
Well, don't worry, son.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.749
I won't let the people down.

13:58.968 --> 14:00.448
Okay, Dewey,

14:00.535 --> 14:01.841
I've got a pretty
good handle on these games.

14:01.928 --> 14:02.842
I just want to ask you
some questions.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.321
Okay.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.062
When I was shouting
encouragement at you,

14:06.149 --> 14:08.021
did it ever make you
feel scared or angry?

14:08.108 --> 14:09.457
What? No.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.285
Good.

14:11.372 --> 14:13.591
And when you lost at Candy Tag,
did it make you feel bad

14:13.678 --> 14:14.941
and want to hurt yourself?

14:15.028 --> 14:17.291
What are you talking about,
Francis?

14:17.378 --> 14:19.336
These questions are weird.

14:19.423 --> 14:21.034
Hey, I'm just trying to
understand better, Dewey.

14:21.121 --> 14:22.600
I mean, I don't know
all the right questions

14:22.687 --> 14:23.950
to ask kids like you.

14:24.037 --> 14:26.735
What do you mean,
"kids like me"?

14:26.822 --> 14:28.693
Well, you're in that class.

14:28.780 --> 14:33.133
And this is a special camp for
children with your... needs.

14:33.220 --> 14:36.397
I'm not emotionally disturbed!

14:36.484 --> 14:38.355
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

14:38.442 --> 14:39.879
There's nothing wrong
with either of us.

14:39.966 --> 14:42.229
I'm not in that class
because I'm disturbed!

14:42.316 --> 14:45.145
I'm in that class
so I can help...

14:45.232 --> 14:47.625
You're a jerk!

14:48.844 --> 14:53.893
Okay, my games obviously
have too much sugar.

14:56.983 --> 14:58.810
[knock at door]

15:01.639 --> 15:03.076
Is everything okay?

15:03.163 --> 15:04.773
Yeah.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.863
This is my favorite
time of day.

15:07.950 --> 15:11.432
The sun's about to come up and
my mean voice is still asleep.

15:11.519 --> 15:13.390
I hate walking to school
in the dark.

15:13.477 --> 15:14.783
I have to run
past people's houses

15:14.870 --> 15:16.480
so I don't catch
their nightmares.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.178
We have to tell
Dewey about this.

15:18.265 --> 15:20.310
No. This is exactly
the kind of thing

15:20.397 --> 15:22.182
he doesn't want
to be bothered with.

15:22.269 --> 15:23.966
We can't handle
taking care of Flerch!

15:24.053 --> 15:25.707
If he dies, we're gonna
have to tell everybody!

15:25.794 --> 15:27.143
Are you saying
I'm not doing

15:27.230 --> 15:28.405
a good job
feeding him?

15:28.492 --> 15:30.625
I chewed his steak
for 20 minutes

15:30.712 --> 15:31.843
before I gave it
to him!

15:31.931 --> 15:34.324
Oh, help me!
It's my heart.

15:34.411 --> 15:37.762
Weakened as it was
by a childhood ailment!

15:37.849 --> 15:40.591
[groans]

15:40.678 --> 15:43.246
He's dying!
I totally called this!

15:43.333 --> 15:44.856
Give him CPR!

15:44.944 --> 15:46.728
I-I'm not strong enough!

15:46.815 --> 15:47.729
We have to keep his heart
pumping.

15:47.816 --> 15:48.817
Use your legs!

15:48.904 --> 15:50.906
Chad, help him breathe.

15:50.993 --> 15:53.256
One, two, three, breathe!

15:53.343 --> 15:57.521
One, two, three,
breathe!

15:57.608 --> 15:59.697
One, two, three, breathe!

15:59.784 --> 16:01.961
One, two, three,
breathe!

16:02.048 --> 16:03.832
Wait.

16:03.919 --> 16:06.487
I saw this thing on TV once
where they helped a guy breathe

16:06.574 --> 16:08.837
by cutting a hole in his throat
and then jamming a pen in it!

16:08.924 --> 16:11.971
I've got a pen!
Somebody get scissors!

16:15.539 --> 16:18.629
Eddie, for God sake, help me!

16:18.716 --> 16:19.674
They're gonna kill me!

16:19.761 --> 16:20.675
I'm sorry I assumed

16:20.762 --> 16:22.329
you could break-dance!

16:22.416 --> 16:24.940
I'm actually one-sixteenth
Cherokee myself!

16:31.294 --> 16:32.382
Dad, you okay?

16:32.469 --> 16:33.905
Malcolm, I couldn't sleep.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.560
My mind has been on fire
with the possibilities

16:36.647 --> 16:38.258
of what this neighborhood
could become.

16:38.345 --> 16:40.651
At first it seemed crazy
and kind of stupid,

16:40.738 --> 16:43.089
but then I remembered what
you said about the factory!

16:43.176 --> 16:45.004
In the middle of the night,
I had a vision.

16:45.091 --> 16:46.440
You had a vision without me?

16:47.310 --> 16:49.965
-"Mulberry Village"?
-Mulberry Village.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.227
A new utopia!

16:51.314 --> 16:53.142
What the hell
is all this stuff?

16:53.229 --> 16:54.578
Just a few
compulsory guidelines

16:54.665 --> 16:56.232
to help people
make the transition.

16:56.319 --> 17:00.019
"Failure to smile
'Hello,' $50 fine?

17:00.106 --> 17:03.152
"Not knowing your
neighbor's name: $25?

17:03.239 --> 17:05.589
Failure to remove
your fence: $100"?

17:05.675 --> 17:07.329
People can be
resistant to change.

17:07.416 --> 17:10.290
What's the "Hug your
Child" initiative?

17:10.377 --> 17:11.682
Everyone has
to publicly hug their child

17:11.769 --> 17:12.857
at least once a day.

17:12.944 --> 17:14.598
A hotline will be set up

17:14.685 --> 17:16.773
so that children can inform
on non-hugging parents.

17:16.861 --> 17:18.950
You're going to make kids inform
on their parents?

17:19.038 --> 17:20.647
Parents, neighbors,
teachers, everybody!

17:20.734 --> 17:22.040
If they've got nothing
to hide,

17:22.127 --> 17:23.738
they've got nothing
to worry about.

17:24.781 --> 17:26.784
Tell me about the
"reeducation center."

17:26.871 --> 17:28.308
Oh! That's where the best,
most neighborly children

17:28.395 --> 17:29.918
will be plucked

17:30.005 --> 17:31.659
from the corrupting influence
of their families

17:31.746 --> 17:34.357
and immersed in round-the-clock
friendliness training.

17:34.444 --> 17:36.620
I call them the Mulberry Youth.

17:36.707 --> 17:40.102
Dad, give me the fliers.

17:40.189 --> 17:41.582
Thank you, son,
but they've already

17:41.669 --> 17:42.713
been distributed
throughout the neighborhood.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.585
Like a modern-day
Martin Luther,

17:44.672 --> 17:46.761
I nailed them
to the front doors.

17:47.762 --> 17:49.111
[people clamoring outside]

17:49.198 --> 17:50.895
Uh, maybe we should
go out the back door

17:50.982 --> 17:52.636
and spend the rest
of the day at the library.

17:52.723 --> 17:56.075
Not now, Malcolm.
The villagers are coming.

17:57.685 --> 18:01.341
Look, I told you,
leave me alone!

18:01.428 --> 18:03.082
I'm just going
to ask your teacher

18:03.169 --> 18:05.084
if I can have ten minutes
with your buddies at recess.

18:09.653 --> 18:11.525
What the hell happened?!

18:11.612 --> 18:14.397
Isn't it obvious?

18:14.484 --> 18:16.747
I know we're not supposed
to ask for help, Dewey,

18:16.834 --> 18:19.707
but this one kind of
got away from us.

18:19.794 --> 18:22.405
We gotta get out of here.
Let's go call the police.

18:22.492 --> 18:24.059
You're just gonna bail?

18:24.146 --> 18:25.887
You don't understand these kids.

18:25.974 --> 18:27.932
If I fix this problem, there's
going to be a hundred more.

18:28.019 --> 18:30.196
It never stops with them!

18:30.283 --> 18:34.765
Dewey, you don't get to choose
the people who need your help.

18:36.550 --> 18:39.509
Look, I don't know much,
but I do know two things.

18:39.596 --> 18:42.208
These kids need your
help, you gotta do it.

18:42.295 --> 18:46.212
And even though I've never met
him, that guy is a total dink.

18:56.178 --> 18:59.312
Aah!

18:59.399 --> 19:01.183
Wow, I thought when
I decided to help,

19:01.270 --> 19:02.750
something would
come to me,

19:02.837 --> 19:04.360
but I'm completely blank.

19:04.447 --> 19:05.796
You're all going to jail.

19:05.883 --> 19:08.016
If you untie me
in the next five seconds,

19:08.103 --> 19:10.540
you and you alone
will see some slight leniency.

19:10.627 --> 19:13.587
Hey, lanyards belong
in the lanyard box.

19:13.674 --> 19:15.066
-What?
-That's my lanyard.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.807
I made it.

19:17.939 --> 19:19.593
Mr. Flerch is going to flip out

19:19.680 --> 19:22.944
if you don't put it back
in the lanyard box.

19:23.031 --> 19:24.554
You couldn't
have made this.

19:24.641 --> 19:26.513
I bought it at a truck stop
200 miles from here.

19:28.863 --> 19:31.474
Can I see that, Francis?

19:33.955 --> 19:35.609
Can you think of any connection

19:35.696 --> 19:38.264
between the thousands
of lanyards that were made

19:38.351 --> 19:40.483
by the emotionally disturbed
children at your school

19:40.570 --> 19:44.183
and this one my brother found
for sale at a retail outlet?

19:47.708 --> 19:49.710
Mr. Jeffers, I would be
horrified to think

19:49.797 --> 19:52.582
that a public school principal
would use innocent children

19:52.669 --> 19:54.236
as slave labor.

19:54.323 --> 19:56.543
I don't know what you're
talking about, young man.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.327
It was all his idea!

19:58.414 --> 20:00.416
I'm just his obedient stooge!

20:00.503 --> 20:04.072
He dangled Assistant Vice
Principal in front of me!

20:04.159 --> 20:08.772
[sobbing]:
It came with parking!

20:08.859 --> 20:10.731
I wonder who would get
the worst penalty.

20:10.818 --> 20:13.124
A bunch of emotionally
disturbed kids

20:13.212 --> 20:14.952
who tied up people
for a little while...

20:15.039 --> 20:18.913
or the trusted public servant
who forced them into slavery?

20:19.000 --> 20:21.698
We could ask a judge,

20:21.785 --> 20:25.049
or everyone could just
keep quiet about everything.

20:26.094 --> 20:27.443
Sound okay to you guys?

20:27.530 --> 20:29.315
[mutters in Spanish]

20:29.402 --> 20:30.881
That depends.

20:30.968 --> 20:32.187
Can we get five minutes
alone with these guys

20:32.274 --> 20:33.319
before you untie them?

20:37.932 --> 20:39.325
[dishes clattering]

20:41.718 --> 20:43.764
What's up with Mom?

20:43.851 --> 20:45.113
She just saw my report card.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.984
I flunked out
of every single class.

20:47.071 --> 20:48.856
What?

20:48.943 --> 20:51.511
Every single one of my finals,
I got every question wrong.

20:51.598 --> 20:53.730
-Oh, my God.
-I know.

20:53.817 --> 20:56.385
Now I get to repeat
my senior year!

20:56.472 --> 20:58.648
Isn't this great?
I worked so hard for this.

20:58.735 --> 21:00.041
I had to make sure

21:00.128 --> 21:01.477
I flunked every class
so completely,

21:01.564 --> 21:03.000
I couldn't make it up
in summer school.

21:03.087 --> 21:05.133
Now I don't have to move out
or go to college

21:05.220 --> 21:07.918
or get a job for a whole
nother year!

21:08.005 --> 21:11.008
This is the greatest achievement
of my entire life!

21:11.095 --> 21:12.445
Yeah, I know, Mom.

21:12.532 --> 21:14.316
[sighs]

21:53.007 --> 21:55.401
