00:02.263 --> 00:02.828
[Archie]
Previously onRiverdale...

00:02.872 --> 00:04.004
The Farm left me.

00:04.047 --> 00:05.483
The worthy ascended.

00:05.527 --> 00:07.007
Where's my mom and Polly?

00:07.050 --> 00:08.225
Gone. Everyone is.

00:09.183 --> 00:11.489
I'm Charles, your brother.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.317
It's vital that
we find your mom ASAP.

00:13.361 --> 00:15.058
Is there anything
we can do to help?

00:15.102 --> 00:16.190
Thought you might ask.

00:16.233 --> 00:17.408
Welcome home, Jay-Jay.

00:18.192 --> 00:19.932
We want your father,
not you.

00:19.976 --> 00:21.499
Understood, Agent Ardelia.

00:21.543 --> 00:23.023
You're under arrest.

00:23.066 --> 00:24.633
For what?

00:24.676 --> 00:27.505
For conducting
illegal activities
at your establishments.

00:27.549 --> 00:30.682
Hermione Lodge,
you're under arrest for
conspiracy to commit murder.

00:30.726 --> 00:32.423
Your own husband's.

00:32.467 --> 00:34.817
This is what I got
when I asked my dad
about that stupid game.

00:34.860 --> 00:37.167
I've been thinking about
making some changes to
this place, Mad Dog.

00:37.211 --> 00:39.865
-I want you to help me run it.
-Oh, yeah.

00:39.909 --> 00:42.172
[Archie] Fred Andrews
will always be
a part of Riverdale.

00:42.216 --> 00:43.565
I love you so much, Dad.

00:45.523 --> 00:48.483
-[door opens]
-[Jughead]
After Mr. Andrews' funeral,

00:48.526 --> 00:51.094
the rest of summer vacation
passed in a surreal haze.

00:53.096 --> 00:56.752
Betty, Veronica, and I
spent as much time
as we could with Archie.

00:58.145 --> 01:00.843
We had dinner
at Pop's every night.

01:00.886 --> 01:04.107
And every day you could tell
he was getting
better and better.

01:04.151 --> 01:06.501
I'm not saying
he wasn't still heartbroken,

01:06.544 --> 01:07.980
the entire town was,

01:08.024 --> 01:09.895
but my pal Archie's a fighter.

01:09.939 --> 01:12.594
And by the last day
of summer vacation,

01:12.637 --> 01:16.119
while the football field
was being mowed
for the new season,

01:16.163 --> 01:19.731
and the school floors
were being buffed to a shine,

01:19.775 --> 01:21.168
and banners
for the first dance

01:21.211 --> 01:22.691
of the year
were being hung,

01:22.734 --> 01:24.780
Archie was doing
what he does best.

01:25.868 --> 01:27.391
You know, Mad Dog,
I was thinking.

01:27.435 --> 01:28.871
School starts tomorrow.

01:30.307 --> 01:31.439
What if you came with me?

01:33.745 --> 01:35.225
[chuckles] Why would I do that?

01:35.269 --> 01:36.444
I don't know,
to get your diploma.

01:38.054 --> 01:39.099
Don't you want it?

01:40.274 --> 01:41.275
Hell yeah.

01:41.318 --> 01:43.407
Okay, then this is your chance.

01:43.451 --> 01:45.366
Isn't your younger brother
gonna be a freshman?

01:45.409 --> 01:46.932
I don't know, Red.

01:46.976 --> 01:48.586
After everything
I've lived through,

01:48.630 --> 01:51.111
I don't think going back to
textbooks and
cafeteria politics

01:51.154 --> 01:54.026
-is really my scene.
-Yeah.
It's not mine either.

01:54.070 --> 01:57.465
But getting that diploma
is what my dad wanted,
so I'm going to do it.

01:57.508 --> 01:59.728
Look, all I'm saying is,
we could do it together.

01:59.771 --> 02:01.382
Hell, you could even
try out for the Bulldogs.

02:01.425 --> 02:02.948
Ooh, a little pigskin.

02:02.992 --> 02:03.862
[Archie laughs]

02:03.906 --> 02:05.473
[indistinct chatter]

02:05.516 --> 02:06.430
[Betty] So, Mom missed
another check-in with you?

02:06.996 --> 02:08.128
Yes.

02:08.171 --> 02:09.868
But like I said, don't panic.

02:09.912 --> 02:11.957
This isn't the first time
she's been late
with the reports.

02:12.001 --> 02:13.394
Well, Charles,

02:13.437 --> 02:15.613
what if that means
she's been found out?

02:15.657 --> 02:17.789
Listen, until she contacts us,

02:17.833 --> 02:20.183
you should just focus on
being a high school student.

02:20.227 --> 02:21.489
I'll reach out
if anything changes.

02:24.100 --> 02:26.189
Now that your parents'
court date has been set,

02:26.233 --> 02:28.060
you need to make a decision.

02:28.104 --> 02:32.326
Are you testifying
on behalf of your mother?
Or your father? Or both?

02:32.369 --> 02:33.327
Or neither.

02:34.110 --> 02:35.155
I can be Switzerland.

02:37.244 --> 02:39.289
At the very minimum,
I recommend

02:39.333 --> 02:41.073
you issue
a statement of support.

02:41.117 --> 02:42.510
The press will want to know
where you stand with--

02:42.553 --> 02:43.946
No comment.

02:43.989 --> 02:45.643
That's my statement.

02:45.687 --> 02:47.341
Now if you'll
excuse me, Mr. Sowerberry,

02:47.384 --> 02:49.647
I have some last-minute
school supply shopping
I need to do.

02:51.519 --> 02:52.824
[Cheryl] Well, Jay-Jay,

02:52.868 --> 02:54.522
which one for
the first day of school?

02:55.262 --> 02:57.351
Rebellious white
after Labor Day

02:57.394 --> 02:59.353
or my signature red?

03:00.528 --> 03:03.139
I agree 100%.

03:04.836 --> 03:06.360
[Betty] You know,
I really can't imagine

03:06.403 --> 03:09.319
a better way to spend
our last night
of summer vacation

03:09.363 --> 03:11.365
Isn't it crazy?

03:11.408 --> 03:14.846
In just nine months,
life as we know it
will be over.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.152
No more high school.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.719
No more Blue and Gold.

03:19.068 --> 03:21.288
No more heart-to-hearts
at the lockers.

03:21.331 --> 03:23.551
Oh, B, don't be sad.

03:23.594 --> 03:25.379
I'm sorry, guys.

03:25.422 --> 03:28.730
I can't help but think
life goes by so fast.

03:28.773 --> 03:32.560
And none of us are very good
at stopping to savor it.

03:34.997 --> 03:36.520
But tonight, we will be.

03:36.564 --> 03:37.391
[Jughead] Mmm-hmm.

03:41.003 --> 03:43.005
[softly] I think
that's our cue, Archiekins.

03:48.445 --> 03:50.099
["Copycat" playing]

03:54.756 --> 03:55.931
[Betty chuckles]

03:58.368 --> 03:59.239
[door closes]

04:51.769 --> 04:53.510
[upbeat music playing]

04:53.554 --> 04:55.120
-Archie?
-Hmm?

04:55.164 --> 04:56.513
I forgot to set the alarm.
Get up.

04:56.557 --> 04:57.558
We're gonna be late.

05:02.563 --> 05:04.260
-[Veronica] You guys, wake up.
-[both] Hmm?

05:04.304 --> 05:06.784
We're gonna be late
for the first day
of senior year. Hurry up.

05:06.828 --> 05:07.872
[Betty] Oh, my God.

05:20.145 --> 05:21.451
-You're late.
-[record scratches,
music stops]

05:22.670 --> 05:24.062
And you are?

05:24.106 --> 05:26.674
I'm Principal Weatherbee's
replacement, Mr. Honey.

05:28.371 --> 05:30.373
We apologize for the tardiness,

05:30.417 --> 05:32.027
Mr. Honey,
it won't happen again.

05:33.071 --> 05:34.551
I don't know
what kind of a ship

05:34.595 --> 05:36.988
Waldo Weatherbee
was running around here,

05:37.032 --> 05:38.642
but things are going to be
different this year.

05:38.686 --> 05:39.817
We'll have order.

05:40.514 --> 05:41.428
Discipline.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.212
Consequences.

05:43.865 --> 05:45.736
Now get out of my sight.

05:55.050 --> 05:57.313
[Coach Clayton]
Okay, he sets up
the bubble screen for you,

05:57.357 --> 05:58.227
you catch...

05:58.445 --> 05:59.402
Bam!

05:59.446 --> 06:00.621
-You run like hell.
-Hmm.

06:00.664 --> 06:02.362
You're one of the fastest
we got, Mantle.

06:02.405 --> 06:03.798
Coach...

06:03.841 --> 06:05.713
Any chance we can make room
for one more Bulldog?

06:05.756 --> 06:07.323
Well, lineup's
pretty much set.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.020
-You looking to play?
-[Mad Dog] Definitely.

06:09.064 --> 06:10.195
If you'll have me
on the team, sir.

06:10.239 --> 06:11.327
So, what's your name?

06:11.371 --> 06:12.372
Munroe.

06:12.850 --> 06:13.895
Munroe Moore.

06:15.418 --> 06:16.854
Come out to practice,
show us what you got.

06:16.898 --> 06:18.378
For sure. I'll be there.

06:18.421 --> 06:19.727
This is gonna be
the best season ever.

06:29.737 --> 06:30.651
[sighs]

06:30.694 --> 06:31.826
[Kevin] I'm not too late, am I?

06:31.869 --> 06:34.481
To sign up for, uh...

06:34.524 --> 06:36.396
I don't know, I was thinking,
maybe an arts reporter?

06:36.874 --> 06:37.832
Kevin...

06:38.572 --> 06:39.486
Betty...

06:40.138 --> 06:42.576
um, I'm also here because...

06:44.491 --> 06:46.231
I've been doing
a lot of work on myself,

06:46.275 --> 06:48.799
ever since I was left behind
by the Farm,

06:48.843 --> 06:50.410
and it's helped me
to realize that

06:50.453 --> 06:52.760
I don't...
I don't need the Farm...

06:53.891 --> 06:55.415
to make me feel whole,
but I...

06:55.458 --> 06:57.242
I do need my friends.

06:57.286 --> 06:59.114
Especially my former
best friend.

07:00.115 --> 07:01.246
[sighs]

07:01.290 --> 07:02.291
I am...

07:03.161 --> 07:04.336
so sorry

07:05.120 --> 07:06.251
for the way I treated you

07:06.295 --> 07:07.688
while I was under
Edgar's spell.

07:07.731 --> 07:09.167
Oh, you mean like

07:09.211 --> 07:12.127
when you dragged me
by my ankles
to get a lobotomy?

07:13.171 --> 07:14.172
Yeah. I...

07:15.435 --> 07:17.828
I'm most ashamed of that.

07:17.872 --> 07:20.135
I hope that I can show you
how much I've changed.

07:20.178 --> 07:21.876
And I hope...

07:23.312 --> 07:25.445
that I prove to you
that you can trust me again.

07:26.184 --> 07:28.230
[sighs] Um, I...

07:28.273 --> 07:30.711
I'm so, so sorry, Betty.

07:34.497 --> 07:36.020
Just fill out
an application, Kev,

07:37.152 --> 07:38.283
and then we'll see.

07:41.548 --> 07:43.114
[Doris on PA]
Jughead Jones,

07:43.158 --> 07:45.682
please report
to the Principal's Office.

07:45.726 --> 07:48.598
Jughead Jones
to the Principal's Office.

07:48.642 --> 07:49.469
[knock on door]

07:51.035 --> 07:51.993
Am I in trouble again?

07:52.036 --> 07:53.255
No.

07:53.298 --> 07:55.170
In fact, you have a visitor.

07:55.213 --> 07:57.302
I'm Mr. Chipping.
It's nice to meet you,

07:57.564 --> 07:58.565
Jughead.

07:58.608 --> 08:00.436
Nice to meet you, too.

08:00.480 --> 08:04.135
Over the summer you submitted
a short story
to a writing contest?

08:04.179 --> 08:05.876
[sighs] Yeah. I didn't win.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.488
Yeah, I know.
I was one of the judges.

08:08.531 --> 08:10.577
And I was very impressed
with your voice.

08:10.620 --> 08:13.362
And while I couldn't
sway my fellow judges,

08:13.405 --> 08:16.496
I can offer you an opportunity

08:16.539 --> 08:17.888
to come study writing with me.

08:17.932 --> 08:21.152
I am a teacher
at Stonewall Prep.

08:21.196 --> 08:22.980
You want me to transfer to
Stonewall Prep?

08:23.024 --> 08:25.200
It's a tremendous offer,
Mr. Jones.

08:25.243 --> 08:26.897
I'm good.

08:26.941 --> 08:29.596
But thank you for the visit
and for liking my story.

08:31.859 --> 08:33.904
[Veronica] My good news
of the day is,

08:33.948 --> 08:36.211
Mrs. Burble said
I'm a shoo-in for Harvard.

08:37.429 --> 08:38.822
[chuckles] I mean, obviously.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.432
-[laughs]
-Damn.

08:40.476 --> 08:42.565
I guess I better start looking
at community colleges in...

08:42.609 --> 08:44.436
Where's Harvard?

08:44.480 --> 08:45.655
-[cameras clicking]
-[reporter 1] Veronica!
Do you think your mother

08:45.699 --> 08:47.483
really tried to have
your father killed?

08:47.527 --> 08:48.528
-Back off.
-[reporter 2] Now that that the
court dates have been set,

08:48.571 --> 08:49.267
-whose side will you choose?
-Oh, hell, no.

08:49.311 --> 08:50.442
[reporters clamoring]

08:52.009 --> 08:53.576
I am not having
my senior year ruined

08:53.620 --> 08:55.926
by a bunch of
bloodsucking paparazzi.

08:55.970 --> 08:58.581
[clamoring continues]

08:58.625 --> 09:00.496
-Screw it.
-[fire alarm ringing]

09:00.540 --> 09:01.366
Archie...

09:03.281 --> 09:04.805
So much for
a quiet senior year.

09:18.253 --> 09:21.386
Mr. Honey,
thank you for meeting with us.

09:21.430 --> 09:24.215
I, Cheryl Blossom,
as Student Body President,

09:24.259 --> 09:26.043
and Antoinette Topaz

09:26.087 --> 09:28.437
as Acting Student Body
Vice-President,

09:28.480 --> 09:31.092
would like to
personally welcome you
to Riverdale High.

09:32.006 --> 09:33.573
Thank you, ladies.

09:34.748 --> 09:36.576
I was actually going to
reach out to you,

09:36.619 --> 09:39.927
regarding that Back to School
Dance that you've organized.

09:40.623 --> 09:41.885
It's canceled.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.539
For why?

09:43.583 --> 09:45.454
At the last student dance,
multiple students
were murdered.

09:45.497 --> 09:46.803
Yes.

09:46.847 --> 09:49.501
But that's exactly why
we need this dance,

09:50.111 --> 09:50.938
to heal.

09:51.721 --> 09:52.853
Mr. Honey,

09:52.896 --> 09:55.072
if I may speak
from personal experience,

09:56.291 --> 09:59.207
the Back to School Dance,
after my brother Jason's death,

10:00.034 --> 10:02.340
provided much needed catharsis.

10:03.124 --> 10:04.604
Hmm. Well, I disagree.

10:09.434 --> 10:12.089
Now, I will only
repeat myself once.

10:12.133 --> 10:15.745
There will be
no Back to School dance.

10:23.144 --> 10:24.754
[Archie] Huddle up, guys.

10:24.798 --> 10:27.104
All right, Munroe,
let's see if we can
catch them napping.

10:27.148 --> 10:28.540
-On one. Ready?
-[teammates] Break!

10:31.718 --> 10:33.763
Watch your man!

10:33.807 --> 10:37.506
Attaboy, Reggie!
Don't give 'em an ounce
of daylight, all right?

10:37.549 --> 10:38.550
Come on. You hear me?

10:39.247 --> 10:40.509
[Archie] Blue, 34.

10:40.552 --> 10:42.076
Blue, 34.

10:42.119 --> 10:43.773
Down. Set. Hut!

10:51.651 --> 10:52.521

pubescent spank bank, are you?

11:55.453 --> 11:57.151
No! No.

11:57.194 --> 12:00.763
A reporter
from Rumordale.com
reached out, and he told me

12:00.807 --> 12:03.287
he would pay 500 bucks
for a photo of Veronica.

12:03.331 --> 12:05.028

say no to that?

12:05.072 --> 12:07.074

12:11.905 --> 12:13.210
Nice job out there, Mad Dog.

12:14.211 --> 12:15.169
Thanks.

12:15.212 --> 12:16.518
It's Munroe, actually.

12:16.561 --> 12:18.868
Oh, my bad.
I thought it was Mad Dog.

12:18.912 --> 12:20.652
Or is that just
what they called you in jail?

12:24.526 --> 12:25.745
It was juvie.

12:25.788 --> 12:27.485

was right there with me.

But settle a bet.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.624

is it true what they say
about dropping the soap?

12:37.800 --> 12:39.280
He's not worth it, dude.
Trust me.

12:45.982 --> 12:47.331
What the hell
is wrong with you?

12:47.375 --> 12:49.333
What do you think, Andrews?

12:49.377 --> 12:51.596
I've been captain
of the Bulldogs
since sophomore year.

12:51.640 --> 12:54.904

who showed up last-minute
stealing my thunder.

giving you a hard time,

13:12.226 --> 13:13.923
Yeah. Uh...

My answer still hasn't changed.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.579
I'm sorry, Mr. Chipping,
but I can't go to your school.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.365
If this is about money,
I got a few bucks socked away.

13:21.409 --> 13:23.193
No. It's not just about money.

13:23.237 --> 13:24.934
Boy, look me
in the eye and tell me

13:24.978 --> 13:27.154
you don't want to go
to a school
that recognizes your talent.

13:28.633 --> 13:30.244
[Mr. Chipping]
Jug, how about this?

13:30.287 --> 13:32.594
How about you come take a tour,
see the place for yourself,

13:32.637 --> 13:34.465
and then make the decision.

13:34.509 --> 13:37.425
-I know. I...
I just don't want to--
-You're taking the damn tour.

14:16.943 --> 14:18.031
Wait. What?

14:20.947 --> 14:22.905
Is this what you do
when I'm not around, Betty?

14:22.949 --> 14:24.689
You read
classified information?

14:24.733 --> 14:27.562
When were you gonna tell me
that you had Kevin
under surveillance?

14:27.954 --> 14:29.869
I wasn't.

14:29.912 --> 14:32.697
From the get-go, I suspected
Kevin hadn't fully
cut ties with the Farm.

14:32.741 --> 14:35.613
I started monitoring
his phone activity,
and it turns out

14:35.657 --> 14:36.788
he's been texting with
Fangs Fogarty.

14:39.879 --> 14:40.880

14:40.923 --> 14:41.881
I'm...

14:43.578 --> 14:46.059

Kevin was done

14:47.060 --> 14:47.974
with the Farm.

14:48.017 --> 14:50.324
It seemed like he was done.

14:50.367 --> 14:52.369
This might be
a blessing in disguise.

14:52.413 --> 14:54.589
We could use the relationship
to our advantage.

14:55.068 --> 14:56.156
In his texts,

14:56.199 --> 14:57.679
Kevin keeps pushing
to meet in person,

14:57.722 --> 14:59.507
but Fangs has been
holding him off, saying

14:59.550 --> 15:02.336
he can't risk it
unless he has something
useful to offer in return.

15:02.379 --> 15:03.903
So...

15:03.946 --> 15:05.948
What if we
accidentally let slip--

15:05.992 --> 15:09.691
Some fake intel
about our investigation
in front of Kevin?

15:09.996 --> 15:11.345
Exactly.

15:11.388 --> 15:14.000
Something that'll lure
Fangs out of hiding.

15:14.043 --> 15:16.306
The first step is to
develop Kevin as an asset.

15:17.307 --> 15:18.308

Our faculty holds
132 master's degrees
and 28 doctoral degrees,

22:23.429 --> 22:25.169
You told me that
you wanted to be my friend,

22:25.213 --> 22:26.997
and then you go out
into the woods

22:27.041 --> 22:30.218
for some secret tryst
with your cult boyfriend.

22:30.261 --> 22:31.350
I'm... I'm sorry

22:31.872 --> 22:34.135
for... for everything.

22:34.178 --> 22:36.355
I truly do
miss being your friend.

22:36.398 --> 22:38.661
You betrayed Betty
after she gave you a chance.

22:38.705 --> 22:42.230
Yeah. [stammering]
I wasn't thinking clearly,
I just wanted to see Fangs.

22:42.273 --> 22:44.101
No. No. You wanted to
trade information,

22:44.145 --> 22:47.017
-so you can get back
in the good graces of the Farm.
-No!

22:47.061 --> 22:48.845
-You're still one of them.
-I'm not, I swear.

22:48.889 --> 22:50.194
I'm not a part of anything.

22:50.238 --> 22:51.631
And you... You, Betty,

22:51.674 --> 22:54.285
you ignored me
all summer, okay?

22:54.329 --> 22:55.852
And I understand,

22:55.896 --> 22:57.114
but I was alone.

22:58.420 --> 23:00.161
At least Fangs texted me back.

23:01.815 --> 23:02.903
He's all I have.

23:03.730 --> 23:04.557
[Kevin sighs]

23:06.907 --> 23:07.908
Can we have a word?

23:20.573 --> 23:22.401
He's useless.
We got to cut him loose.

23:22.444 --> 23:23.793
No, Charles. I...

23:24.664 --> 23:26.970
I believe Kevin, okay?

23:27.014 --> 23:28.537
I saw them in the woods.

23:28.581 --> 23:29.843
I think he'll help us.

23:29.886 --> 23:31.192
No. We're not going to get
anywhere with him.

23:31.235 --> 23:32.106
He's traumatized.

23:32.846 --> 23:33.847
He's lonely.

23:34.456 --> 23:36.023
Listen, I'm sorry, Betty.

23:36.066 --> 23:37.590
We'll find another way
to get Alice back.

23:38.547 --> 23:39.418
[whistle blows]

23:40.201 --> 23:41.158
[Marty] Let's go, Reggie!

23:41.202 --> 23:42.290
Blue, 18.

23:42.986 --> 23:44.161
Blue, 18.

23:45.380 --> 23:47.338
Down. Set. Hut!

23:51.560 --> 23:52.474
[boy] Get it. Get it. Get it!

23:53.475 --> 23:55.216
-[groans]
-[Marty] All, come on!

23:55.259 --> 23:56.913
[whistle blows]

23:56.957 --> 23:59.002
All right, guys,
hit the shower.
Practice is over.

24:01.614 --> 24:03.920
[Marty] Hey!
Get over here.

24:04.704 --> 24:06.401
What the hell are you doing?

24:06.445 --> 24:07.968
I had it, Dad. It just slipped.

24:08.011 --> 24:09.665
It slipped?

24:09.709 --> 24:11.580
It won't happen again,
I promise.

24:11.624 --> 24:13.930
If it does, so help me,

24:13.974 --> 24:15.062
-I'll--
-[Archie] What?

24:16.498 --> 24:17.934
You're gonna hit him again?

24:17.978 --> 24:19.458
Give him another black eye?

24:19.501 --> 24:20.371
What the hell
have you been saying?

24:20.415 --> 24:21.547
Nothing, Dad.

24:21.590 --> 24:23.418
Andrews, this is none
of your business.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.681
Reggie works his ass off
on this field
while you stand here and yell.

24:25.725 --> 24:27.204
We all have to listen to it.

24:27.248 --> 24:28.292
So, get the hell out of here.

24:28.336 --> 24:29.772
Go. Or I'll
throw you out myself.

24:29.816 --> 24:32.471
Back off, Andrews. I mean it.

24:32.514 --> 24:34.690
Reggie, your dad has no right
to treat you like this.

24:36.518 --> 24:38.215
-[Munroe] Hey.
-[Coach Clayton] Hey, hey.
Knock it off, you two.

24:38.259 --> 24:39.608
-Hey. Hey!
-Knock it off.

24:39.652 --> 24:41.175
-Knock it off.
-Dead to me, Andrews.

24:42.524 --> 24:43.482
Dead!

24:49.792 --> 24:50.663
Go.

24:51.011 --> 24:52.012
Go!

24:56.364 --> 24:57.278
[school bell rings]

24:59.193 --> 25:00.542
[Bret] Hey, Forsythe.

25:00.586 --> 25:02.457
Guys, this is that kid
from Riverdale.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.807
Forsythe, this is Donna,
Jonathan, Joan.

25:04.851 --> 25:06.983
Good afternoon,
seekers of knowledge!

25:07.680 --> 25:08.898
Why are we not sitting?

25:12.380 --> 25:14.295
Now then, Moby-Dick.

25:15.905 --> 25:16.950
Hmm?

25:16.993 --> 25:18.517
It's well done.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.127
Obviously.

25:20.170 --> 25:23.739
But it highlights a problem
that I have with the syllabus.

25:23.783 --> 25:26.089
Do we really need to
hear this narrative again?

25:26.133 --> 25:29.136
Right. Because the only authors
we're allowed to like now

25:29.179 --> 25:31.138
are those who
lived an unblemished life.

25:31.181 --> 25:32.313
I'm fine with that.

25:32.356 --> 25:34.968
Guys, guys, guys.
Let's get back on topic.

25:35.011 --> 25:39.407
Now, what do you think
that the whale symbolizes?

25:40.321 --> 25:41.148
Nothing.

25:44.891 --> 25:47.197
Care to elaborate
on that, Mr. Jones?

25:50.505 --> 25:54.553
Well, it's
pretty well-established
that Melville hated allegory.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.772
And he's quoted as saying
that his biggest fear was

25:56.816 --> 25:58.818
Moby-Dickwould be
seen as a fable.

25:58.861 --> 25:59.732
[Mr. Chipping] Any rebuttals?

26:03.910 --> 26:05.564
[door buzzing]

26:10.481 --> 26:12.483
Breaking out the blonde wig,
I see.

26:12.527 --> 26:14.877
Yes, that's the only way
I can get around

26:14.921 --> 26:16.705
without being harassed
by the paparazzi.

26:17.097 --> 26:18.533
But then...

26:18.577 --> 26:21.188
you'd know all about that,
wouldn't you?

26:21.231 --> 26:23.407
Oh, are you receiving
some blowback

26:23.451 --> 26:25.322
from lying through your teeth
to get me arrested?

26:25.888 --> 26:26.715
How unfortunate.

26:27.629 --> 26:29.588
Why did you leak the story?

26:29.631 --> 26:32.068
Was it a desperate ploy
to get me to come see you?

26:32.112 --> 26:34.593
Mija,I'm not paying
for your crimes.

26:35.289 --> 26:36.943
I merely told the truth.

26:36.986 --> 26:39.249
I told the world what you are,

26:40.294 --> 26:41.121
a Lodge,

26:42.078 --> 26:42.905
through and through.

26:45.386 --> 26:46.474
Deal with it.

26:49.259 --> 26:50.086
[door buzzing]

26:50.870 --> 26:52.785
["Cross Me" playing]

27:06.276 --> 27:08.844
-[glass clinking]
-[man] Whoo!

27:08.888 --> 27:12.065
My esteemed guests,
may I have
your attention please?

27:12.108 --> 27:15.329
Students of Riverdale,
we have a new enemy
in our midst.

27:15.372 --> 27:17.505
This killjoy is
our new principal,
Mr. Honey.

27:18.332 --> 27:19.899
[crowd booing]

27:19.942 --> 27:22.728
However, never fear.

27:22.771 --> 27:24.599
I, as your
student body president,

27:24.643 --> 27:27.994
will make sure
that he is beheaded
by Homecoming,

27:28.037 --> 27:30.779
or my name
isn't Cheryl Marjorie Blossom.

27:30.823 --> 27:32.563
[all cheering]

27:32.607 --> 27:34.174
["Cross Me" continues playing]

27:40.833 --> 27:42.399
-[Jughead] Your drinks, ladies.
-Thank you.

27:42.443 --> 27:43.400
[Veronica thanks in French]

27:43.444 --> 27:45.141
So...

27:45.185 --> 27:47.056
What's this I hear
about you transferring?

27:48.318 --> 27:51.713
Jug is being recruited
by Stonewall Prep.

27:51.757 --> 27:54.237
How was the salon today,
by the way?

27:54.281 --> 27:56.065
Shocked to say, I actually
kind of enjoyed it.

27:56.109 --> 27:58.720
And the kids had
actually read Moby-Dick.

27:58.764 --> 28:00.026
Jughead,

28:00.069 --> 28:02.115
there is no school
more nihilistic

28:02.158 --> 28:03.943
and/or privileged
than Stonewall.

28:03.986 --> 28:07.381
Besides, why would you
want to leave
your lovely girlfriend here?

28:07.424 --> 28:09.426
Jug, we would make
anything work.

28:09.905 --> 28:11.472
Okay?

28:11.515 --> 28:12.952
But I would miss you.

28:12.995 --> 28:14.301
[Veronica]
Trust me when I say,

28:14.867 --> 28:16.782
you would be miserable.

28:16.825 --> 28:18.305
I'm just trying to keep
an open mind, is all.

28:19.567 --> 28:20.568
Hmm.

[panting]

28:23.832 --> 28:24.877
[groans]

28:30.273 --> 28:31.840
[Cheryl] Excuse me?

28:31.884 --> 28:33.102
What are you doing down here?

28:34.103 --> 28:36.018
-What's up?
-This hallway is off-limits.

28:36.062 --> 28:38.847
The locked door
at the top of the stairs
should've been a hint.

28:38.891 --> 28:41.197
Yeah. The line
to the bathroom
was too long.

28:41.241 --> 28:42.590
Was looking for another one.

28:42.633 --> 28:44.723
Then get thee to the barn
with the other animals.

Hey.

29:00.826 --> 29:01.783
Hey.

29:03.959 --> 29:07.397
I'm sorry
that we interrogated you.

29:07.441 --> 29:09.356
It's okay. I get it.

29:09.399 --> 29:10.749
You're trying to save your mom.

29:12.533 --> 29:13.490
Yeah.

29:19.105 --> 29:20.541
What I'm about to tell you

29:22.108 --> 29:24.675
puts everything on the line,

29:24.719 --> 29:26.634
but I believe in you.

29:28.462 --> 29:29.593
What are you talking about?

29:29.637 --> 29:30.551
[inhales deeply]

29:33.119 --> 29:34.903
My mom isn't just at the Farm,

29:36.731 --> 29:39.516
she's undercover at the Farm.

29:39.560 --> 29:42.171
She's been sending us
messages all summer,
but she stopped.

29:42.215 --> 29:44.130
And I'm worried that
she may be in trouble.

29:45.218 --> 29:46.959
Oh, my God, Betty...

29:47.002 --> 29:49.918
And I know that
you can turn around
and tell Fangs everything,

29:49.962 --> 29:52.268
but I'm choosing to believe
that our friendship

29:52.312 --> 29:55.054
runs deeper
than Edgar's brainwashing.

29:55.097 --> 29:56.577
It... It...

29:56.620 --> 29:57.447
It does.

29:57.883 --> 29:58.797
Kev...

30:00.189 --> 30:02.801
I need you to ask Fangs
to meet with you again,

30:02.844 --> 30:04.715
so he can tell you
where Edgar is hiding.

30:04.759 --> 30:05.978
He won't.

30:06.021 --> 30:08.197
He will if you have
information to give him.

30:08.241 --> 30:10.286
Like the name
of the FBI witness,

30:10.330 --> 30:12.680
who doesn't actually exist,
by the way.

30:12.723 --> 30:14.508
But we can give him
a fake name.

30:16.336 --> 30:17.206
Like who?

30:17.250 --> 30:19.078
Like Penelope Blossom.

30:19.121 --> 30:21.732
Kev, will you do this?
Will you help me?

30:22.690 --> 30:23.909
Will you help my mom?

30:24.823 --> 30:26.172
Of course, Betty.

30:28.696 --> 30:29.958
[music playing]

30:32.047 --> 30:32.874
Yo.

30:33.570 --> 30:35.659
Who invited you, new guy?

30:35.703 --> 30:37.400
Dude, Reggie, lay off.

30:38.010 --> 30:39.011
Cheryl,

30:39.707 --> 30:41.274
you know this guy?

30:41.317 --> 30:44.103
No, but I certainly don't
object to him being here,

30:44.146 --> 30:45.669
which is more
than I can say for you.

30:45.713 --> 30:46.975
So what you're saying is...

you better not be drinking
whatever's in that cup.

[Reggie] Sheriff Jones.

31:09.432 --> 31:11.043
Someone get this man a beer.

31:11.086 --> 31:13.306
You want to see the inside
of the drunk tank
tonight, Mantle?

31:13.349 --> 31:14.524
I'll take him home, Mr. Jones.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.485
What are the charges,
Sheriff Jones,

31:18.528 --> 31:19.660
if one might ask?

31:20.574 --> 31:22.402
Someone called the station
about the noise.

31:22.445 --> 31:23.969
Impossible.

31:24.012 --> 31:26.885
All of Thistlehouse's neighbors
are either deaf or dead.

31:26.928 --> 31:28.887
Who exactly made
this absurd complaint?

31:28.930 --> 31:30.062
Someone named, uh...

31:30.714 --> 31:31.541
Honey.

31:32.064 --> 31:33.065
Party's over, Cheryl.

31:42.988 --> 31:44.815
Reg, I think I already know,

31:45.599 --> 31:46.905
but how did you get
the black eye?

31:49.820 --> 31:51.039
What do you want me to say?

31:51.648 --> 31:52.519
Huh?

31:54.042 --> 31:57.002
That my dad hits me?

31:57.045 --> 32:00.266
That he beats
the crap out of me
over the stupidest things?

32:00.309 --> 32:03.486
That he's been doing it for
as long as I can remember?

32:05.967 --> 32:07.534
I'm sorry, Reg. I really am.

32:10.624 --> 32:14.149
I was always so jealous
of the relationship
you had with your dad.

32:14.193 --> 32:16.151
No matter what
you wanted to do,

32:16.195 --> 32:17.457
he always stuck by you.

32:18.632 --> 32:20.851
I have no idea
what that feels like.

32:25.508 --> 32:27.075
And when your dad died,

32:28.990 --> 32:31.036
all I kept thinking was,

32:31.079 --> 32:33.081
what if it had been
my old man instead?

32:42.134 --> 32:43.744
Listen, what can we do?

32:43.787 --> 32:44.919
Or what can I do?

32:44.963 --> 32:46.355
You've already done
enough, man.

32:47.095 --> 32:48.183
You called him out.

32:49.793 --> 32:50.838
Now, it's on me.

32:54.407 --> 32:55.712
I gotta take a stand.

32:57.366 --> 32:58.541
So, what are you thinking?

33:03.111 --> 33:04.417
[Archie] Bro,
are you sure about this?

33:06.854 --> 33:09.422
Sometimes I think
he loves this car
more than he does me.

33:10.510 --> 33:12.425
I mean, you could just...
You could talk to him.

33:13.034 --> 33:13.992
I've tried.
