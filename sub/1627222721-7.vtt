WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.669
Happiness is inside you.

00:02.669 --> 00:05.171
Use a joyful lens to find it,
and let it free.

00:05.171 --> 00:08.508
Soon, each and every one of you
will be able to learn this technique.

00:08.508 --> 00:12.095
This. It's a multitool.
I whittled it, for the bucket.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.722
<i>You think that I still work for Curtain?</i>

00:13.722 --> 00:16.599
This whole happiness technique of his,
I invented it.

00:16.599 --> 00:17.976
My inventions.

00:17.976 --> 00:19.060
They live here.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.687
- Where is Curtain?
- Northern Italy.

00:20.687 --> 00:23.023
<i>We all know where we're going.
We'll meet there.</i>

00:23.023 --> 00:25.525
<i>If we get separated,
don't slow down.</i>

00:25.525 --> 00:27.861
<i>Negative thoughts only cloud the mind.</i>

00:27.861 --> 00:30.363
- Constance, are you okay?
- Of course.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.950
The house is surrounded. Time to go.

00:33.950 --> 00:35.785
<i>How long have they been like this?</i>

00:35.785 --> 00:37.746
There's a small chance
this is a repercussion of the program.

00:37.746 --> 00:41.124
<i>Apparently, all of them
had complained of stiff necks.</i>

00:41.124 --> 00:43.168
<i>We proceed
with the kidnapping as planned.</i>

00:43.168 --> 00:45.587
<i>He will arrive to find
evening tea set for two.</i>

00:45.587 --> 00:47.922
<i>The tea will contain
a trace amount of duskwort,</i>

00:47.922 --> 00:49.424
<i>a powerful sedative.</i>

00:49.424 --> 00:50.508
To new memories.

00:50.508 --> 00:51.468
Wait.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.345
I really need someone to talk to.

00:54.345 --> 00:57.974
Whatever is wrong,
I'm sure it's going to turn out okay.

00:58.975 --> 01:01.478
You're right. Everything will be okay.

01:10.862 --> 01:12.072
Nicholas,

01:12.072 --> 01:14.532
a good tea should never be over-sugared,
you know that.

01:14.532 --> 01:18.661
Oh, yes, yes. I'm just afraid
that this, um, this particular brew

01:18.661 --> 01:20.914
that Number Two made,
I'm afraid it's quite bitter.

01:21.039 --> 01:23.249
Well, no surprise there.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.584
Mm-hmm.

01:25.668 --> 01:26.920
- Are you all right?
- Hm?

01:28.004 --> 01:30.465
Yes. Why wouldn't I be?

01:31.132 --> 01:33.843
I'm with my brother, my family.

01:38.556 --> 01:39.974
Uh, Number Two.

01:39.974 --> 01:42.060
Did you have a nice conversation
with young Auguste?

01:42.060 --> 01:46.731
Very much so.
What a delightful child. So bright.

01:46.731 --> 01:50.151
Yes. He certainly is.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.779
Well, I better get going.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.072
No.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.324
Big day tomorrow.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.994
I am so glad
we had this tea time together.

02:01.704 --> 02:02.831
Consumed or not.

02:03.915 --> 02:04.791
Me as well.

02:06.084 --> 02:07.168
Have a nice evening.

02:08.628 --> 02:09.629
Both of you.

02:10.880 --> 02:11.840
Yeah.

02:15.343 --> 02:18.429
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I know I failed.

02:18.429 --> 02:20.473
I failed miserably, but I could not do it.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.475
I could not poison my own brother.

02:22.475 --> 02:25.186
- Please.
- I completely understand.

02:25.186 --> 02:26.855
Oh, yes. What?

02:26.855 --> 02:28.773
You shared a womb with him.

02:28.773 --> 02:30.859
Of course, you don't want
to cause your brother harm.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.486
You love him.

02:34.821 --> 02:35.697
Number Two.

02:37.490 --> 02:40.368
Number Two, are... are you...

02:42.453 --> 02:43.413
happy?

02:50.086 --> 02:53.298
Okay, Constance, Sticky,
and Dipika being detained.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.216
It changes things significantly.

02:55.216 --> 02:56.926
- I hope they're okay.
- Oh, we'll find them.

02:56.926 --> 02:59.971
- This is no longer a simple exfiltration.
- Agreed.

02:59.971 --> 03:02.599
I'm escalating this to a threat
level zeta, possibly epsilon.

03:02.599 --> 03:05.518
- Agreed.
- I'm not familiar with your threat levels.

03:05.518 --> 03:06.728
Not in the least.

03:06.728 --> 03:09.814
It's our own system we made up to classify
bug and animal threats to the farm

03:09.814 --> 03:10.940
and dictate our response.

03:10.940 --> 03:12.275
But it can be applied to off farm-ops.

03:12.275 --> 03:16.654
Epsilon would signal a roaming bear,
post hibernation or the equivalent.

03:16.654 --> 03:18.823
So very dangerous.

03:18.823 --> 03:21.951
Action plan zeta and epsilon mandate
children to stay in the crow's nest

03:21.951 --> 03:23.369
and wait for danger to be cleared.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.580
Thank you for not fighting me on this.

03:25.580 --> 03:28.791
I've stared down the barrel
of Curtain's Brainsweeper.

03:28.791 --> 03:29.959
I'm fine staying put.

03:31.544 --> 03:35.215
- Ready?
- Run silent, run deep.

03:36.633 --> 03:37.675
Always.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.185
What are you doing?

03:48.019 --> 03:49.229
Thirty seconds pretty much guarantees

03:49.229 --> 03:51.189
they'll be far enough away
not to see our movements.

03:51.856 --> 03:54.692
We're not moving anywhere.
We're staying here, remember?

03:55.068 --> 03:57.237
Not when Sticky and Constance need us
more than ever.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.698
Twenty-nine, thirty.

04:02.492 --> 04:03.326
Let's go.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.208
Well, it has been quite some...

04:11.626 --> 04:12.752
Really?

04:14.045 --> 04:16.172
I thought it a wise precaution,

04:16.172 --> 04:19.133
considering how slippery
they've proven to be in the past.

04:19.133 --> 04:20.468
Take them off now.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.179
Yes, right. Of course.

04:26.724 --> 04:28.893
I am terribly sorry.

04:29.686 --> 04:33.398
Constance, Sticky.
It is so wonderful to see you again.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.442
My, how you two have grown.

04:37.026 --> 04:40.488
I suppose, Reynard and Kate
aren't too far behind

04:40.488 --> 04:43.908
knowing how tight-knit
your little society is.

04:44.575 --> 04:47.245
- They're nowhere near here.
- They should be here soon.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.122
It'll be nice to see them.

04:49.497 --> 04:50.873
Thank you.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.294
Just pull it.

04:59.716 --> 05:00.550
So sorry.

05:05.638 --> 05:10.601
Yes. Again, I apologize
for this barbaric treatment.

05:10.601 --> 05:12.478
That's not my way. You know that, Sticky.

05:13.229 --> 05:15.189
What I know, is that you're evil.

05:15.523 --> 05:17.400
Oh, Sticky, friend.

05:17.400 --> 05:21.195
Hypnotizing people into feeling happy,
manipulating their minds?

05:21.571 --> 05:24.032
You don't care about anyone's
well-being except your own.

05:24.907 --> 05:26.993
That negativity is not good for you, Sticky.

05:26.993 --> 05:31.372
Stress, premature aging, death, hair loss.

05:31.372 --> 05:32.999
Listen to her. She's right.

05:32.999 --> 05:36.627
All your anxiety is eating away at you.

05:39.005 --> 05:44.469
Please, let me help you break free
from all that tension

05:44.886 --> 05:48.264
and find the inner peace
at the core of your being.

05:49.557 --> 05:52.602
The peace and wholeness

05:52.602 --> 05:58.066
you have been searching for all your life.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.128
All this time, I was letting my suspicions

07:00.128 --> 07:01.212
- get in the way.
- Oh, yes.

07:01.212 --> 07:03.464
I thought, no one could suddenly
become happy.

07:03.464 --> 07:05.007
- I know.
- It's not possible.

07:06.050 --> 07:09.429
But I was wrong. Completely wrong.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.848
- Oh.
- Oh, this is incredible!

07:11.848 --> 07:16.644
I know, but... but do you still think
it's not real?

07:16.644 --> 07:20.273
Oh, but it is real. And it feels so good!

07:21.607 --> 07:23.234
I know. I know. I know.

07:24.318 --> 07:26.654
But when I think about it logically
in my mind,

07:26.654 --> 07:28.698
I just want to resist with all my might.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.741
And I go back and forth
and back and forth, and it's just...

07:32.118 --> 07:36.289
- Then maybe try not to think so much.
- Oh, yes.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.333
What if everything is just fine?

07:39.333 --> 07:41.169
Oh, that sounds lovely.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.463
- Yes. Yes.
- Just live in the moment.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.256
- Can you feel it?
- Yes. I can.

07:45.256 --> 07:48.134
- That unbridled joy.
- Yes, yes, I do.

07:49.760 --> 07:53.473

08:38.392 --> 08:40.311
Right. What can't it do?

08:40.311 --> 08:43.689
It's canvas! Rhonda, it's a sail!

08:44.106 --> 08:46.776
Rhonda? Rhonda. Rhonda, Milligan.

08:49.028 --> 08:54.492
- Oh, my word. Oh, so good to see you.
- Thank goodness you're okay.

08:54.492 --> 08:57.870
- You too.
- Oh, we're not okay.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.664
- Yeah.
- We're fantastic.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.249
Yes, we've never been better.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.709
But we have been missing you
and the children.

09:04.794 --> 09:05.795
Uh...

09:07.547 --> 09:11.634
Blink once if they have this room bugged.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.636
- No.
- No. No, no bugs.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.013
- We're fine, we assure you.
- Sir.

09:16.013 --> 09:18.349
You're dressed in the faded rags
of a hostage.

09:19.141 --> 09:20.685
- A prisoner.
- I know.

09:20.685 --> 09:23.813
- And I have never been more comfortable.
- I'm getting my own soon.

09:23.813 --> 09:24.981
- Oh, yes.
- I can't wait.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.024
I requested yellow.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.902
- Like the sun.
- Yes.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.182
It's like a horse-camel.

10:01.475 --> 10:02.768
Something my dad would carve.

10:05.479 --> 10:06.897
Does it bother you to lie to him?

10:07.732 --> 10:08.941
It had to be done.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.943
Sticky and Constance
are behind enemy lines.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.361
There was no time to debate.

10:13.112 --> 10:15.239
Well, just because you had to do something

10:15.239 --> 10:17.450
doesn't mean you can't
at least feel bad about it.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.910
Maybe I do feel bad. Okay?

10:25.041 --> 10:26.417
There they are. I see them.

10:27.835 --> 10:29.045
What are they wearing?

10:30.087 --> 10:34.216
- Why is Constance... smiling?
- What?

10:40.931 --> 10:42.600
Your bungalow is right this way.

10:43.225 --> 10:47.021
- Do you smell the sage?
- Aromatic.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.023
That's phlomis fruticosa.

10:49.023 --> 10:51.359
Its lipophilic compounds
are what carry the fragrance.

10:53.527 --> 10:56.447
I know I tease you, Sticky,
but the truth is,

10:56.447 --> 10:58.240
I enjoy your scientific facts.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.785
They're enlightening.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.080
Thanks, Constance.

11:15.132 --> 11:16.175
You made it.

11:18.594 --> 11:21.514
- Are you all right?
- Uh, kind of.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.307
I missed you so much, Kate.

11:26.477 --> 11:28.604
- What's wrong with her?
- Curtain did it.

11:28.604 --> 11:30.523
He flipped some kind of switch
in her brain.

11:30.523 --> 11:34.151
- What? How?
- It's this thing he does.

11:34.151 --> 11:36.320
Looks into your eyes. Moves his hand.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.739
It causes some kind of neural coherence.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.616
He even does it on his TV show.

11:40.616 --> 11:43.369
Constance had the TV on,
and next thing I knew,

11:43.369 --> 11:45.413
she was acting suspiciously nice to me.

11:47.289 --> 11:49.792
If niceness is a crime, I'm guilty.

11:50.334 --> 11:52.211
Skip the trial. Straight to prison.

11:54.964 --> 11:58.968
- It's highly unsettling.
- Actually, it's been great.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.928
She's an absolute pleasure to be around.

12:01.762 --> 12:02.930
Did he get to you too?

12:03.472 --> 12:06.183
He tried, but I started doing
long division in my head

12:06.183 --> 12:07.810
to keep my brain occupied.

12:07.810 --> 12:11.564
Then I realized if I fake being happy,

12:11.564 --> 12:14.358
it might be easier to find Mr. Benedict
and Number Two.

12:14.358 --> 12:16.026
Impressive spycraft, Sticky.

12:16.652 --> 12:19.363
Subterfuge, impersonation.
I like the way you're thinking.

12:19.363 --> 12:20.364
I love it.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.869
- Let's go find the adults.
- Wait.

12:25.786 --> 12:27.288
You two need to blend in.

12:32.668 --> 12:34.128
I am not putting those clothes on.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.643
To reach into someone's mind

12:49.643 --> 12:53.063
and release their inner joy,
it takes skill.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.190
It takes wisdom.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.485
And it takes patience
to master the technique.

12:59.361 --> 13:03.032
But once you see the sadness and despair

13:03.449 --> 13:07.119
replaced by a warm, radiant smile...

13:08.496 --> 13:10.664
...you'll know it was all worth it.

13:13.501 --> 13:18.714
Just ask Auguste and Belinda
and Leandro and Yang-chi.

13:19.715 --> 13:22.843
They've worked hard... and they're ready.

13:23.302 --> 13:29.934
And soon all of you will be ready
to share your gifts with the world.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.902
- What are they doing?
- Yes!

13:40.236 --> 13:43.030
There's something off about them?
Look at Mr. Benedict.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.282
- They all seem... happy.
- Yes!

13:45.282 --> 13:48.619
Oh, no. That kind of happy.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.162
And why shouldn't they be?

13:50.663 --> 13:53.707
Life is a banquet.
It's a gift to be alive.

13:56.585 --> 14:02.550
Today, I am proud to announce
the launch of 63 Happiness Centers,

14:02.550 --> 14:05.010
all across the globe,

14:05.010 --> 14:09.890
to be opened and operated
by each one of you in this room.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.184
Wow!

14:21.694 --> 14:23.654
I got it. They're undercover.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.658
- That's it.
- That has to be it.

14:27.658 --> 14:30.202
Our goal is simple, exponential growth.

14:30.202 --> 14:33.122
Just really, really good at it.

14:33.122 --> 14:38.419
To reach every corner of our world
and to spread joy.

14:39.169 --> 14:43.257
In Kyoto, New Delhi, San Diego,

14:43.257 --> 14:49.138
Melbourne, Kuala Lumpur,
Santiago, Lagos, Khartoum.

14:58.939 --> 15:01.734
Where was I? Yes, Khartoum.

15:02.860 --> 15:06.947
Warsaw, Buenos Aires, Mumbai, Bogota.

15:07.781 --> 15:11.201
Yes, the dawn of a new era is at hand.

15:11.201 --> 15:15.039
Thanks to you
and your unwavering dedication.

15:15.039 --> 15:19.835
So, today on our main green
is a celebration in honor of all of you,

15:19.835 --> 15:22.630
the future purveyors

15:22.630 --> 15:27.593
of the worldwide happiness revolution.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.393
Thank you. Thank you.

15:36.393 --> 15:37.895
Yes.

15:37.895 --> 15:39.188
Whoo!

15:44.318 --> 15:47.237
Please. Please, go enjoy the festivities.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.034
Go, enjoy.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.838
- Nathaniel.
- No, not now, Nicky.

16:04.838 --> 16:08.926
Nathaniel, that man,
what... what happened to him? Is he okay?

16:08.926 --> 16:11.971
Yeah, it appears there's a...
there's a bug going around

16:11.971 --> 16:14.932
- and it's nothing too serious, yes.
- Are you sure?

16:17.601 --> 16:18.560
I'm positive.

16:20.270 --> 16:22.648
I have the best doctors in Europe here.
They can handle it.

16:23.357 --> 16:26.110
Now, please, go be with your friends.

16:26.902 --> 16:29.530
They seem... very happy to be with you.

16:29.530 --> 16:32.366
Yes, yes. But...

16:40.874 --> 16:43.752
- Ms. Perumal.
- Reynie.

16:44.420 --> 16:45.462
Ooh.

16:47.548 --> 16:49.675
- I'm so glad to see you.
- We're here to rescue you.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.552
We need to leave as quickly as possible.

16:51.552 --> 16:55.180
- Is Mr. Benedict here?
- He's here somewhere. But leave?

16:55.556 --> 16:56.682
You just got here.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.685
You haven't seen
all the amazing opportunities.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.189
Kate.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.567
I know you're going to be mad at me,
but just let me say...

17:06.567 --> 17:10.487
Mad? Never. Why would I be that?

17:11.321 --> 17:14.408
I misled you. No, I lied to you.

17:14.408 --> 17:16.952
- Oh, it's understandable.
- What?

17:16.952 --> 17:19.538
So many of our conflicts are unnecessary,

17:19.538 --> 17:25.210
not just between you and me,
but humans generally.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.547
I'm saying you have every reason
to be upset with me.

17:28.547 --> 17:31.884
Upset.

17:31.884 --> 17:35.220
There is no point to that emotion.

17:37.389 --> 17:40.392
- You guys are so convincing.
- Thanks.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.187
Of what?

17:43.187 --> 17:45.731
It's me. You guys can drop your cover.

17:45.731 --> 17:49.568
Oh, there's absolutely no need
for deception.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.821
You see, what you see is what you get.

17:52.821 --> 17:54.281
And you get what you get.

17:54.281 --> 17:57.201
- No regrets.
- Well said.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.619
Well said.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.454
- We love it here, Sticky.
- Yes.

18:00.454 --> 18:01.622
And you will too.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.833
You guys are not undercover.

18:06.668 --> 18:08.295
He got to them. All of them.

18:08.295 --> 18:09.713
- Just like he got to...
- Constance!

18:10.547 --> 18:12.216
I was wondering where you all went.

18:14.885 --> 18:17.721
I get it. You miss old Constance.

18:17.721 --> 18:19.973
Acerbic personality formed by suffering.

18:21.225 --> 18:22.976
You don't like new Constance.

18:22.976 --> 18:26.188
She unnerves you,
which is the last thing she wants to do.

18:26.188 --> 18:28.482
- No, that's not it.
- Not at all.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.901
- New Constance is refreshing.
- We like her.

18:31.985 --> 18:33.779
It's the adults
we're worried about.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.364
We have to find some way
to snap them out of it.

18:35.364 --> 18:38.575
It's only natural to want others
to be as miserable as you are.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.995
- We're not miserable.
- I won't press the issue.

18:43.038 --> 18:44.498
We just want them to be themselves.

18:44.498 --> 18:47.209
They are themselves. I, myself.

18:47.209 --> 18:50.087
Garrison created the technique
to free the true self.

18:50.087 --> 18:51.296
I see that now.

18:51.755 --> 18:55.634
- Garrison did this?
- She was the brains, of course.

18:56.426 --> 18:58.929
So if anyone knows
how to reverse this, it's her.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.014
But she's gone into hiding.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.016
We don't need her. I've got it covered.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.563
Kate delights me. Her frantic activity.

19:09.064 --> 19:11.608
- Garrison's notebook?
- You stole it?

19:12.442 --> 19:15.028
Garrison's proven she can't be trusted
with technology.

19:15.028 --> 19:17.447
Writings of a lunatic genius.

19:17.447 --> 19:21.535
Looks depressing.
I'm going to find some positivity.

19:31.837 --> 19:32.921
This is unacceptable.

19:33.338 --> 19:36.216
It's disruptive.
It's unsettling to our community.

19:36.216 --> 19:39.428
And it provokes questions
that do not need to be asked.

19:39.428 --> 19:40.846
- We understand.
- Absolutely.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.893
From now on,
if anyone complains of a stiff neck,

19:45.893 --> 19:49.146
an ache, a crick, the slightest twinge,

19:49.146 --> 19:51.857
they need to stay inside their cabins.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.650
- Absolutely, out of sight.
- Invisible.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.277
It's for their own good.

19:56.528 --> 19:59.907
- So we can take good care of them.
- Of course.

19:59.907 --> 20:02.117
- So thoughtful.
- Always looking out.

20:03.327 --> 20:06.622
I take it that the doctor's treatments
have yielded no results?

20:06.622 --> 20:08.957
- Not, as of yet.
- Oh, my...

20:08.957 --> 20:12.211
So, whatever resources you need,
we need to get this fixed.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.046
- We are on it.
- We are fixers.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.422
So fix it!

20:15.422 --> 20:20.510
I do not have time for these intrusions,
these relentless trespasses.

20:20.510 --> 20:22.971
Those child spies that Jeffers picked up

20:22.971 --> 20:24.973
said others are on the way,
so fix that too.

20:24.973 --> 20:26.308
- Consider it done.
- Consider it done.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.060
Dr. Curtain,

20:29.519 --> 20:32.648
given the current personnel situation.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.943
We see a need for qualified individuals
to step in.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.027
Proven winners.

20:37.027 --> 20:41.281
Known quantities. Aides who,
unlike previous holders of the position,

20:41.281 --> 20:44.326
would immediately share
all pertinent information with you,

20:44.326 --> 20:47.162
- no matter how bad it may sound.
- The point, please.

20:48.830 --> 20:55.545
It seems the problem with the... sleepers,
isn't just localized.

20:55.545 --> 20:57.923
There have been similar reports
from all over the world.

20:57.923 --> 21:02.135
Among our community.
Practitioners of your system.

21:05.013 --> 21:06.098
Similar reports.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.350
A correlation,

21:09.351 --> 21:12.771
which is not the same as a causation,
is that correct?

21:12.771 --> 21:15.023
- Of course not. None whatsoever.
- It has no bearing on the situation.

21:15.023 --> 21:15.941
Mm-hm.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.944
Which I think someone who is ready
for a leadership role

21:18.944 --> 21:20.821
would instinctively grasp.

21:20.821 --> 21:24.866
Now, I am going to go prepare

21:24.866 --> 21:27.327
for the live broadcast
of our expansion plans.

21:27.327 --> 21:29.997
You two are going to go back out
to the celebration

21:29.997 --> 21:31.957
and keep an eye out for any symptoms.

21:33.625 --> 21:40.173
And next time, do not bring me a problem
for which you have no solution.

21:46.888 --> 21:50.058
- I told you, we need to pick our moment.
- You were a full participant.

21:54.021 --> 21:57.190
- I thought you might be dead.
- Constance.

21:58.900 --> 22:01.069
- Oh, my.
- But I'm very happy you're not.

22:01.069 --> 22:03.655
Oh, I'm so happy to see you.

22:06.491 --> 22:07.826
Where is everyone else?

22:09.536 --> 22:11.538
Whisperer, the Brainsweeper.

22:11.538 --> 22:14.207
- It's all in here.
- But nothing about happiness.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.210
Kate, go back to the section
of The Whisperer.

22:20.630 --> 22:24.801
"The Whisperer is designed to create
a state of anxiety and discontent."

22:25.886 --> 22:30.098
And here underneath her note,
"The reverse is always possible."

22:31.767 --> 22:32.726
What's this?

22:33.894 --> 22:36.355
She's talking about
how the optic nerve triggers changes

22:36.355 --> 22:37.689
in the prefrontal cortex.

22:38.190 --> 22:41.818
The optic nerve? It's the way in,
so maybe it's also the way out.

22:41.818 --> 22:42.861
Mm.

22:42.861 --> 22:46.573
Optics. You mean like,
flashing a bright light in someone's eye?

22:46.573 --> 22:47.532
Exactly.

22:47.532 --> 22:50.202
An ultra-concentrated flash of light
at the right wavelength

22:50.202 --> 22:52.245
could shock the photoreceptors in the eye.

22:52.871 --> 22:55.082
Maybe it can jar the brain into resetting.

22:55.999 --> 22:57.042
I could build something,

22:57.042 --> 22:59.836
but I'd need something stronger
than my flashlight bulbs.

22:59.836 --> 23:03.173
There was a photographer inside.
She was taking flash photos.

23:04.007 --> 23:06.093
I've successfully stolen
several items recently.

23:16.728 --> 23:20.565
<i>♪ Feeling down n' dirty
Feeling kinda mean ♪</i>

23:21.358 --> 23:24.277
- We can attach the battery there.
- Oh, yeah.

23:24.277 --> 23:27.781

23:31.284 --> 23:34.871

23:53.932 --> 23:58.895
<i>♪ No disguise for that double vision ♪</i>

23:59.354 --> 24:01.898
I need something to trigger a shutter.

24:02.023 --> 24:04.985
Something small, movable, built to last.

24:07.779 --> 24:10.574
<i>♪ It's always new to me ♪</i>

24:10.574 --> 24:14.202
<i>♪ My double vision gets the best of me ♪</i>

24:26.381 --> 24:29.718
- What if it doesn't work?
- Positive thinking, Sticky.

24:31.011 --> 24:33.180
- Do you think it'll work?
- 50/50?

24:34.556 --> 24:35.974
Maybe 40/60?

24:37.601 --> 24:39.603
That's pretty good.

24:47.194 --> 24:49.529
<i>♪ The stars won't come out ♪</i>

24:50.155 --> 24:53.408

25:18.725 --> 25:20.060
Oh, yeah.

25:23.146 --> 25:26.233
<i>♪ I promise life will be sweeter ♪</i>

25:26.233 --> 25:30.195
<i>♪ And it said so in my dreams ♪</i>

25:32.614 --> 25:35.116
That is an unexpected vision.

25:36.034 --> 25:39.579
<i>♪ The gypsy told me so last night ♪</i>

25:39.579 --> 25:42.999
<i>♪ Said she saw our children playing... ♪</i>

25:43.875 --> 25:45.502
Let's give this baby a whirl.

25:45.502 --> 25:47.754
Where's my dad? Let's start with him.

25:47.754 --> 25:50.715
<i>♪ And there was you and I ♪</i>

25:50.715 --> 25:54.636
<i>♪ In a house, baby, no lie ♪</i>

25:54.636 --> 25:56.304
It sounds like you're overthinking this.

25:56.304 --> 26:00.016
No, I don't think so.
Those people are staring into nothingness.

26:00.016 --> 26:03.603
And I know I should feel something,
but I couldn't, which terrified me.

26:04.145 --> 26:06.314
But I was relieved
to at least feel that terror.

26:06.314 --> 26:08.525
Well, there's nothing we can do
about it now.

26:08.525 --> 26:10.026
- In this moment.
- Yes.

26:10.026 --> 26:12.904
- I guess that's true.
- So, enjoy the music.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.364
- Yeah, I feel.
- And turn.

26:14.364 --> 26:15.365
Oh.

26:16.324 --> 26:18.618
<i>♪ Whoa, my Candida ♪</i>

26:19.619 --> 26:23.248
<i>♪ Just take my hand, and I'll lead ya ♪</i>

26:23.248 --> 26:26.626
Katie Kat. You should join in.

26:27.127 --> 26:28.712
You'll enjoy it.

26:28.712 --> 26:31.673
I only do contemporary jazz
and Welsh folk style.

26:33.466 --> 26:34.551
Right.

26:34.551 --> 26:37.220
I... I made you something.

26:40.682 --> 26:42.642
Utterly thoughtful.

26:44.227 --> 26:45.061
What is it?

26:45.061 --> 26:46.646
I call it the Wetherall Worldview Wash.

26:46.646 --> 26:49.941
Just look through the eyepiece,
turn the knob, and enjoy the show.

26:49.941 --> 26:53.486
You are an amazing person, Kate Wetherall.

26:53.486 --> 26:54.821
I have strong genes.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.782
- Go on. Look into it.
- Okay.

27:02.787 --> 27:07.125
- I don't see anything.
- Turn the knob.

27:25.018 --> 27:27.187
You deliberately misled me at the gates.

27:28.355 --> 27:30.440
Lies of omission are still lies.

27:30.440 --> 27:31.775
Yes, they are.

27:31.775 --> 27:32.942
It worked.

27:34.944 --> 27:38.281
Did I give you the impression back there
that I had no standards?

27:40.116 --> 27:41.284
I'm sorry.

27:51.419 --> 27:55.674
Hi. Oh, you seem upbeat, as you should be.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.676
Looks like you've gotten acclimated.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.470
I have. I'm totally. I love it.

28:01.054 --> 28:02.681
Oh, I wanted to show you something.

28:02.681 --> 28:03.807
Look in here.

28:04.599 --> 28:07.477
- Oh, okay.
- Just turn the knob.

28:17.654 --> 28:19.072
What am I supposed to see?

28:19.072 --> 28:22.409
Turn the knob. It's magnificent.

28:39.342 --> 28:40.802
You need to see this.

28:41.761 --> 28:45.223
- Oh, can it wait? I'm vibing.
- Oh, it's most certainly cannot.

28:45.890 --> 28:49.686
- I'm vibing, I said.
- Trust me.

28:51.187 --> 28:55.066
And I do, with my life.
Okay, just quickly.

29:01.531 --> 29:04.784
- Yang-chi. Did he just touch his neck?
- He was scratching his ear.

29:09.038 --> 29:12.917
- Wait. Those children, are they...
- They're spies.

29:12.917 --> 29:14.586
They're spies.

29:21.801 --> 29:22.844
Whoa.

29:23.678 --> 29:24.971
Welcome back.

29:26.806 --> 29:28.933
- Too much perspective.
- Um-hm.

29:28.933 --> 29:31.269
False perspective, now...

29:31.269 --> 29:34.272
- Perspective on the perspective.
- Yes.

29:37.233 --> 29:38.735
That object they're passing around,
what is it?

29:38.735 --> 29:42.030
- I don't know, but it's concerning.
- Beguiling and suspicious.

29:42.030 --> 29:43.740
Mr. Benedict, now.

29:51.998 --> 29:52.916
What's this?

29:55.001 --> 29:56.211
Turn the knob.

30:01.090 --> 30:02.592
- My shoulder!
- Your shoulder!

30:02.592 --> 30:04.469
- It's dislocated.
- Stay with me.

30:04.469 --> 30:06.429
- It's just my shoulder, but thank you.
- All right.

30:06.429 --> 30:07.597
Let's get you some help.

30:18.024 --> 30:20.318
That was an odd impulse.

30:21.528 --> 30:24.823
- He didn't turn the knob in time.
- We need to leave now.

30:25.323 --> 30:26.825
Where's Constance?

30:38.378 --> 30:39.963
We need transportation out of here.

30:39.963 --> 30:43.174
I have become intimately familiar
with the delivery truck situation.

30:43.174 --> 30:45.468
Let's jump in one of those
and never look back.

30:45.468 --> 30:49.347
- No, we cannot leave without my brother.
- We absolutely can. We must.

30:49.347 --> 30:52.851
Exigent circumstances.
The children are with us now, sir.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.435
- Mr. Benedict is right.
- Thank you.

30:54.435 --> 30:56.479
Curtain's organization
is expanding rapidly.

30:57.105 --> 30:59.858
- She gets a vote now?
- She does.

31:01.025 --> 31:02.944
Well, I suppose it's true.

31:02.944 --> 31:05.697
Every day more people fall under his sway.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.782
And more people
have fallen into waking comae.

31:07.782 --> 31:08.992
That's plural for coma.

31:08.992 --> 31:12.036
I saw it happen to a poor man
in the Great Hall and many, many others.

31:12.036 --> 31:15.164
It could happen to anyone in his program.
It's a side effect.

31:15.164 --> 31:17.458
- And Curtain knows about this.
- Yes.

31:17.959 --> 31:21.421
And he's still moving full speed ahead
with his expansion plans.

31:22.380 --> 31:26.342
- He is.
- We have to remove Curtain immediately.

31:26.342 --> 31:29.470
The best way to stop a snake
is to chop off its head.

31:29.470 --> 31:32.140
- No.
- And then you two can stay together.

31:32.140 --> 31:35.101
- That's a sensible plan.
- Even though he's a snake without a body.

31:36.060 --> 31:37.145
Come, come, come.

31:39.564 --> 31:40.773
Let's go get him.

31:41.733 --> 31:45.111
Oh, excuse me. "Let's"?

31:45.862 --> 31:48.573
It's called a contraction. "Let us".

31:50.825 --> 31:51.951
Us.

31:57.665 --> 32:01.544
Audience, take your seats, please.
We are live in ten minutes.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.424
It's not just for everybody else.

32:07.300 --> 32:12.597
You, too, can opt into joy
and good feeling.

32:13.514 --> 32:18.728
You, too, can choose happiness.

32:24.275 --> 32:26.486
Use a joyful lens.

32:30.073 --> 32:31.950
A joyful lens.

32:35.119 --> 32:38.164
Choose happiness.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.291
Choo...

32:42.085 --> 32:43.252
What is it?

32:44.003 --> 32:46.130
- Um, flower delivery.
- What?

32:48.007 --> 32:48.883
Oh, I see.

32:56.349 --> 32:57.725
Flower delivery?

32:57.725 --> 33:01.604
The dart's dipped in duskwort
which, technically, is a flower.

33:02.188 --> 33:03.356
Of course.

33:06.275 --> 33:08.319
- Oh, gently, Milligan.
- Of course.

33:10.530 --> 33:13.491
Here's the address.

33:13.491 --> 33:15.368
- I hope he's not a light sleeper.
- Yeah.

33:15.368 --> 33:18.371
With a healthy dose of duskwort.
It should last for hours.

33:18.371 --> 33:20.748
Good, because we have
a long drive ahead of us.

33:45.356 --> 33:48.026
Hey, whoa, whoa. Stop, stop!

33:52.238 --> 33:54.782
- Dr. Curtain?
- Dr. Curtain, are you there?

34:00.580 --> 34:02.331
- He's been kidnapped!
- He's been kidnapped!

34:03.624 --> 34:05.126
Call in the greys!
