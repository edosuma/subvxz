01:35.400 --> 01:37.026
Magnificent, aren't they?

01:37.944 --> 01:39.779
God's tears.

01:42.240 --> 01:43.658
Yeah.

01:44.242 --> 01:45.910
It's beautiful.

01:45.993 --> 01:47.829
So are the others.
I, uh...

01:49.205 --> 01:53.167
I guess I just...
have to make the right decision.

01:54.377 --> 01:57.088
In the end, it's not your eye
that must decide.

01:58.381 --> 01:59.531
Yeah.

02:10.435 --> 02:11.769
Did Rebecca call?

02:11.853 --> 02:15.106
Yeah. She'll be at the restaurant
in an hour to take you to the airport.

02:15.189 --> 02:18.693
I put your tickets, passport, and
your new cell phone in your briefcase

02:18.776 --> 02:20.403
and Hong will be there
in ten minutes.

02:20.486 --> 02:22.488
Thanks. See you in four days.

02:22.572 --> 02:23.740
The second you land,

02:23.781 --> 02:26.951
those guys are gonna start poking
and prodding to see what you're made of.

02:27.034 --> 02:29.036
Are you sure I'm the right guy
for this, Walter?

02:29.120 --> 02:32.373
I'm no good at this corporate stuff,
I hate flying...

02:32.457 --> 02:34.083
And isn't this Bob's thing, anyway?

02:34.167 --> 02:36.502
Bob? Come on, you're gonna be fine.

02:36.586 --> 02:38.254
Just don't eat anything
that wears a collar,

02:38.296 --> 02:41.048
and if you need me, I'll be on the beach
in Cozumel screening my calls.

02:42.091 --> 02:45.052
Look... this is a big break for you.

02:45.136 --> 02:48.973
But I'm giving you this account because
I think you're the right man for the job.

02:49.057 --> 02:51.392
Besides, you're gonna be a member
of the family soon, right?

02:52.685 --> 02:53.936
Going down, please.

02:56.230 --> 02:58.900
Oh. Matthew, keep away
from the bang-bang girls

02:58.983 --> 03:00.777
or Rebecca will kick my ass, all right?

03:14.373 --> 03:15.523
Matty.

03:16.584 --> 03:18.961
- Matty!
- Luke! Hey, man.

03:19.045 --> 03:21.214
- How are you, man?
- I'm good. How are you?

03:21.297 --> 03:24.258
Really good. Really good.
Good to see you. You look great.

03:24.342 --> 03:26.010
Thanks, man. I mean, I do.

03:26.094 --> 03:28.262
You still doing that whole
advertising thing in New York?

03:28.888 --> 03:30.056
I moved back.

03:30.139 --> 03:32.308
- When did you get back?
- Two months ago.

03:32.392 --> 03:34.060
Two months? What are you doing?

03:34.143 --> 03:36.479
You don't call your friend?
You could've called me.

03:36.521 --> 03:39.524
I know. I just... I moved back
with a girl that I met in New York

03:39.607 --> 03:41.692
and I'm working for her brother,
and it's...

03:41.776 --> 03:43.486
That sounds serious.

03:44.445 --> 03:46.155
Maybe. I don't know.
We'll see.

03:46.239 --> 03:48.574
You look very serious.
Look at you.

03:48.658 --> 03:49.992
I know, man.

03:50.034 --> 03:51.202
Hold on!

03:51.285 --> 03:53.329
Listen, man,

03:53.413 --> 03:55.581
Yeah, I need to probably
move my car, too.

03:55.665 --> 03:57.208
And then I'm going to China tonight.

03:57.291 --> 03:59.460
- China? That's weird.
- Yeah, I know.

03:59.544 --> 04:01.337
Let me give you a call
when I get back. Monday?

04:01.421 --> 04:03.256
Yeah, sounds good... shut up!

04:03.339 --> 04:07.385
All right, look, here's my card.
Don't wait two years... call me!

04:07.468 --> 04:08.618
The old shop.

04:08.678 --> 04:10.054
- All right?
- I will, man.

04:10.138 --> 04:11.639
You look good.
That's a nice tie.

04:11.723 --> 04:12.765
Good to see you.

04:12.849 --> 04:15.143
Are you done? Come on!

04:23.776 --> 04:26.738
He's very impressed
with what you've done,

04:26.779 --> 04:30.283
and he assures you
that when you get to China,

04:30.366 --> 04:33.619
you'll be met with much enthusiasm
and support.

04:33.703 --> 04:35.705
Thank you very much.

04:36.497 --> 04:39.167
Some champagne, please.
Excuse me.

04:46.591 --> 04:48.092
Excuse you.

04:48.968 --> 04:52.972
Matthew is a, uh, photographer.
Beautifully, wonderfully creative man.

04:53.056 --> 04:55.016
And here's my favorite sister.

04:55.099 --> 04:56.601
His only sister.

04:57.935 --> 05:00.980
Mr. Hong, Ms. Chin,
this is my sister Rebecca.

05:06.611 --> 05:08.112
Hey, Sweetie. How are you?

05:08.196 --> 05:09.363
As you can see,

05:09.447 --> 05:12.408
Matthew has managed to make himself
indispensable even away from the office.

05:17.455 --> 05:20.792
Here, Sweetie. Just take one of these,
to help you sleep on the plane.

05:20.875 --> 05:23.377
Mr. Hong would like
to propose a toast.

05:23.461 --> 05:24.611
Oh, yes.

05:27.381 --> 05:31.094
To a long and prosperous marriage...

05:31.135 --> 05:32.845
of our two companies.

05:32.929 --> 05:34.097
Are you okay?

05:34.138 --> 05:35.765
Yeah.

05:35.807 --> 05:38.351
Um, excuse me.

05:38.434 --> 05:39.602
I'll be right back.

05:40.686 --> 05:42.355
Excuse me,

06:01.207 --> 06:02.792
Just a minute!

06:02.875 --> 06:04.377
Sorry.

06:27.024 --> 06:29.694
No, you listen!
And I don't feel like calming down.

06:29.777 --> 06:32.780
It's over, okay?
That's why I wanted to meet.

06:34.699 --> 06:37.118
No, actually I don't think
it was an accident.

06:41.622 --> 06:42.790
It's in the paper!

06:45.168 --> 06:46.753
I don't ever want
to see you again, Daniel.

06:49.297 --> 06:52.008
Stop following me,
or I'll call the police!

06:54.218 --> 06:55.386
Lisa.

06:57.221 --> 06:58.389
Lisa!

07:01.434 --> 07:03.686
Whoa. Hey, come on.

07:04.687 --> 07:06.481
Are you all right?

07:07.607 --> 07:09.442
I pissed her off.

07:10.610 --> 07:12.820
You wanna put that
on this card, please?

07:50.149 --> 07:53.403
Oh! This stupid...

07:53.486 --> 07:54.987
Need some help there, Mare?

07:55.905 --> 07:57.865
- What's up?
- It's so frustrating.

07:57.949 --> 08:00.618
I just can't work out
why there's no sound.

08:00.701 --> 08:02.036
I just...

08:22.473 --> 08:24.767
Matthew? Hello?

08:25.935 --> 08:27.395
Anybody home?

08:28.771 --> 08:31.023
I'll take this one, if you want.

08:31.107 --> 08:32.692
Knock yourself out, kid.

08:58.551 --> 08:59.886
Oh, my God.

09:03.639 --> 09:04.789
Shit.

09:07.518 --> 09:10.521
- They wanna know how long... hey!
- Mary, I'll be right back.

09:10.605 --> 09:11.939
- Sorry.
- Where are you going?!

09:12.023 --> 09:13.173
Oh, sorry!

09:37.090 --> 09:39.258
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Lisa.

09:39.342 --> 09:41.052
See you inside.

11:24.739 --> 11:25.889
Hey.

11:26.908 --> 11:28.058
Hey.

11:28.868 --> 11:31.037
- Probably time to go, right?
- Yes.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.288
Okay.

11:38.002 --> 11:41.464
Pre-boarding call
for flight 752 to Munich.

11:41.547 --> 11:44.926
All passengers should board
at this time at gate 5-A

11:47.637 --> 11:49.597
I guess, uh, this is it.

11:49.680 --> 11:51.808
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

11:51.891 --> 11:53.142
No. No, I'm fine.

11:53.226 --> 11:54.894
Okay. Well,
call me when you get there.

11:54.977 --> 11:56.437
Okay. I will.

11:56.521 --> 11:57.671
I love you.

11:58.523 --> 11:59.673
Me, too.

12:02.193 --> 12:03.236
Bye.

12:03.319 --> 12:04.469
Bye.

12:08.699 --> 12:09.849
Your attention. Please.

12:09.909 --> 12:14.247
This is the final boarding call
for American Airlines flight 153

12:14.330 --> 12:16.290
service to Shanghai.

12:16.374 --> 12:19.585
All passengers should now
be boarding at gate 10-B.

12:22.630 --> 12:25.800
Matthew Simon.
S-l-M-O-N.

12:29.053 --> 12:30.203
Shit.

12:32.140 --> 12:33.307
Yeah.

12:34.851 --> 12:37.687
Yeah. No, he's not on the plane.

12:41.274 --> 12:42.424
He's...

12:44.485 --> 12:45.653
He's sick.

12:46.779 --> 12:49.866
No, he's very sick.
He has food poisoning.

12:50.825 --> 12:53.161
No, he'll be there

13:16.934 --> 13:18.084
Lisa?

13:27.195 --> 13:28.696
All right.

13:38.956 --> 13:40.792
Hello?

14:09.862 --> 14:11.030
Lisa?

14:54.282 --> 14:57.744
Here. Sweetie. Just take one of these
to help you sleep on the plane.

15:38.618 --> 15:42.455
That line... what it does to your calf...
That is what we call sexy.

15:43.414 --> 15:45.124
Wanna try pink? Hmm?

15:45.208 --> 15:47.043
- Okay.
- Okay. Have a seat.

15:47.126 --> 15:49.462
Hey. There you are.
Where you been?

15:49.545 --> 15:51.756
You look like shit.
I hope she was worth it.

15:51.839 --> 15:54.842
Hey, do we have
a size ten in pink?

15:54.926 --> 15:56.427
Yeah, in the back.

15:56.511 --> 15:57.804
- Hey, Ellie.
- Hey.

15:57.887 --> 15:59.555
- I gotta talk to you.
- Lady Dragon Shoes.

15:59.597 --> 16:01.599
Ow. So, who is she?

16:02.642 --> 16:03.893
You wouldn't believe me.

16:03.976 --> 16:06.312
Betcha I do. I probably even know her.
What's her name?

16:07.647 --> 16:08.815
That's the thing.

16:10.149 --> 16:12.735
You don't know her name?
Oh, man.

16:12.819 --> 16:14.362
I know that she's a dancer.

16:14.987 --> 16:16.406
You mean, like a stripper?

16:16.447 --> 16:19.283
No, shithead.

16:19.367 --> 16:21.869
Oh, God.

16:21.953 --> 16:23.663
But her face is like...

16:23.746 --> 16:25.206
Her eyes...

16:26.833 --> 16:29.460
and her... skin is just...

16:30.711 --> 16:32.255
She just makes me all...

16:32.338 --> 16:37.260
What is "wha" and "duh"? She just
makes you more inarticulate than usual.

16:37.301 --> 16:40.388
You are obsessed,

16:40.471 --> 16:43.433
I mean, I don't know how

16:43.516 --> 16:46.477
I mean, my customer over there...
She's got great legs. Ellie.

16:46.561 --> 16:49.397
All right? There is
something hot about Ellie.

16:49.480 --> 16:50.940
The blonde at the window.

16:51.023 --> 16:52.525
I mean, come on.

16:56.487 --> 16:57.655
What are you doing?

17:00.867 --> 17:02.118
Matty, are you all right?

17:02.201 --> 17:04.454
Lady Dragon Shoes.
Can I help you?

17:06.455 --> 17:08.332
The blonde?

17:14.005 --> 17:15.298
What are you doing?

17:15.339 --> 17:16.507
Give me some shoes.

17:16.590 --> 17:17.842
- Shoes?
- Yeah.

17:17.925 --> 17:19.176
Got lots of shoes.

17:25.767 --> 17:28.686
I'm sorry I took so long.
Pink. It's my last pair.

17:31.856 --> 17:33.524
Could I help you with anything?

17:35.026 --> 17:36.176
Yes.

17:37.570 --> 17:39.572
Those shoes in the window.

17:39.655 --> 17:41.491
The black ones
with the red sole.

17:41.532 --> 17:44.035
I'd like to try them on, please.

17:44.118 --> 17:45.912
The blacks and reds. Okay.

17:45.995 --> 17:48.539
I'll just go in the back
and get them for you.

17:49.707 --> 17:52.085
That's where we keep them...
In the back... so...

17:53.169 --> 17:54.337
I'll be right back.

17:54.420 --> 17:55.671
Uh, Matty?

17:55.755 --> 17:59.175
Maybe you'd like to ask the lady
what size shoe she wears.

17:59.217 --> 18:00.593
- Right.
- 8 1/2.

18:00.676 --> 18:02.512
Like Fellini.

18:02.553 --> 18:04.055
Right.

18:04.138 --> 18:09.560
I mean his movie, not his shoe size.

18:12.605 --> 18:13.773
8 1/2.

18:16.943 --> 18:17.944
Shit.

18:18.027 --> 18:19.237
What was that?

18:19.320 --> 18:20.905
Fellini! What the hell
was I thinking?

18:20.988 --> 18:22.615
I have no idea.

18:22.698 --> 18:25.743
But you were right about one thing.
God, she's beautiful.

18:25.827 --> 18:28.830
And you, my man, are an idiot.

18:28.913 --> 18:31.249
All right, look.
Here's the thing, all right?

18:31.332 --> 18:33.626
You've obviously blown it,
she obviously hates you,

18:33.709 --> 18:35.878
so you stay right here
and let the man take a shot.

18:35.920 --> 18:38.423
- Shut up. Give me the shoes.
- All right. Go.

18:38.464 --> 18:40.299
Just remember...
You're not funny.

18:46.806 --> 18:48.558
Here we go.
Black and red.

19:16.794 --> 19:18.129
What do you think?

19:20.089 --> 19:21.424
They're too big.

19:22.884 --> 19:24.218
Too big? Really?

19:25.094 --> 19:27.513
Luke, these are 91/2s.

19:28.139 --> 19:30.767
I'm sorry.
That's the smallest size we have.

19:30.850 --> 19:32.351
Oh, well. Too bad.

19:33.269 --> 19:35.730
Not... you know...
not necessarily.

19:35.813 --> 19:37.607
We can order these for you.

19:37.690 --> 19:40.485
Special order. And, uh...
I can, uh, if you leave your number,

19:40.568 --> 19:42.779
I can give you a call personally
when they come in.

19:42.820 --> 19:44.906
Do you normally spy on people?

19:46.991 --> 19:48.141
What?

19:49.327 --> 19:53.164
Are you really gonna tell me that
you're a huge fan of modern dance?

19:58.669 --> 20:02.924
Look, I've never done
anything like that before.

20:04.509 --> 20:08.805
Honestly... could you let me take you out
for a cup of coffee and explain?

20:08.888 --> 20:10.431
I don't think so.

20:10.515 --> 20:12.809
I'll stay on my side of the table.
I promise.

20:12.850 --> 20:15.061
Just call me
when the shoes come in, okay?

20:16.729 --> 20:18.981
Listen, I'm not what you
think I am. Ok?

20:25.947 --> 20:27.097
Shit.

20:36.791 --> 20:41.504
"Tomorrow night. 6:00.
Café Tangiers on Kinzie.

20:41.587 --> 20:43.589
Now you won't have to follow me."

21:04.569 --> 21:08.573
Well, my parents eventually split up,
and my mom moved back to Prague.

21:09.407 --> 21:11.826
But my dad's still here.
He lives in California.

21:13.786 --> 21:15.955
I wish I was in California right now.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.377
So, why did you want
to become a photographer?

21:25.715 --> 21:26.966
Fish.

21:27.133 --> 21:28.384
Fish.

21:30.595 --> 21:32.263
Tropical fish, actually.

21:33.890 --> 21:38.811
When I was a kid, I used to go
to the library and pick out all the books...

21:39.645 --> 21:41.355
with tropical fish, you know.

21:41.439 --> 21:44.150
Beautiful colors and shapes.

21:44.233 --> 21:47.904
When I was eight years old, I realized
someone had to take pictures of the fish.

21:47.987 --> 21:49.739
And I wanted that to be me.

21:50.490 --> 21:54.327
But I grew up and I realized that...

21:54.410 --> 21:57.371
things don't have to be extraordinary
to be beautiful.

21:57.455 --> 21:59.791
The ordinary
could be just as beautiful.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.794
Like what?

22:04.337 --> 22:05.487
Well...

22:06.089 --> 22:07.924
Like... you see the couple there?

22:09.217 --> 22:11.886
Look at the way the girl
is holding on to him so tight.

22:11.969 --> 22:14.180
But he can still drink his coffee.

22:14.263 --> 22:17.100
It looks like she feels safe
wrapped around him.

22:23.356 --> 22:25.691
And if you believe that,
I'll tell you another one.

22:33.408 --> 22:34.784
Take my picture.

22:36.202 --> 22:38.121
I feel beautiful tonight.

23:18.703 --> 23:19.853
Bye.

23:33.509 --> 23:34.659
Bye.

23:45.521 --> 23:46.671
Okay.

24:25.186 --> 24:26.854
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:26.497 --> 25:27.832
Ma'am?

25:27.915 --> 25:30.585
I have your dry cleaning.

25:32.253 --> 25:33.629
Shit.

26:08.873 --> 26:11.042
Hey, you're not in China.

26:11.125 --> 26:12.835
I didn't make it past O'Hare.

26:13.795 --> 26:15.588
- What happened?
- I found Lisa.

26:15.671 --> 26:17.256
Whoa.

26:24.222 --> 26:25.431
Here it is.

26:25.515 --> 26:27.350
This is the article she left behind.

26:28.142 --> 26:30.144
The funeral's today.

26:30.228 --> 26:32.271
I can't believe you're
blowing off Shanghai for this.

26:32.355 --> 26:34.690
This isn't actually Lisa.
This is a compact.

26:34.732 --> 26:36.943
What about your woman?
What's her name, anyway?

26:37.026 --> 26:38.194
Rebecca.

26:38.236 --> 26:39.904
Yeah, I mean, isn't...

26:41.447 --> 26:42.782
Shit.

26:44.242 --> 26:45.410
Is it broke?

26:46.994 --> 26:48.162
You superstitious?

26:48.246 --> 26:50.289
God, I am so stupid.
Here, give it to me...

26:50.373 --> 26:52.333
- No, no. It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

26:52.417 --> 26:55.086
You're right.
This doesn't make any sense.

26:55.169 --> 26:57.839
One minute I'm looking at rings,
and the next I'm here, doing this.

26:57.922 --> 27:00.716
Whoa.
Whoa, looking at rings?

27:00.758 --> 27:03.177
I didn't realize you were that serious.

27:03.261 --> 27:04.595
Apparently, I'm not.

27:05.179 --> 27:08.141
See, that's how the universe works.

27:08.224 --> 27:11.394
The minute you make a decision...
You decide on anything...

27:11.436 --> 27:13.688
Along comes temptation.

27:14.564 --> 27:15.940
What would you do?

27:17.483 --> 27:21.404
Keep them both and hope they didn't find
out about each other is what I would do.

27:21.487 --> 27:23.823
That's perfect.
Asshole.

27:28.995 --> 27:31.247
I have to find out why she left.

27:31.330 --> 27:33.166
She got scared.
Everyone gets scared.

27:33.249 --> 27:36.836
No, not Lisa. She wouldn't have
left without an explanation.

27:36.919 --> 27:39.589
Without some sort of letter
or a call or something.

27:39.630 --> 27:41.591
She's not like that.

27:41.632 --> 27:44.135
Something must've happened,
and whatever it was...

27:44.218 --> 27:46.554
Screwed you up big time.

27:51.559 --> 27:52.935
I know she loved me.

27:54.479 --> 27:56.481
So let me borrow
your keys, okay?

27:57.648 --> 27:58.798
Why?

27:59.817 --> 28:02.320
The funeral's today.
It's the only lead I've got.

28:02.403 --> 28:04.280
Oh... my car.

28:04.989 --> 28:07.366
- Come on.
- Okay. I know. I'm sorry.

28:07.450 --> 28:09.410
You just have to be back by 7:00.

28:09.494 --> 28:10.828
I will. Thank you.

28:10.912 --> 28:12.246
I've got a date.

28:14.290 --> 28:15.958
You got a date?

28:16.000 --> 28:17.168
Yeah, I got a date.

28:18.002 --> 28:19.152
With who?

28:19.212 --> 28:22.799
This actress that came into my shop
a couple weeks ago, and, uh...

28:22.840 --> 28:26.594
God, I like her a lot,

28:26.677 --> 28:29.764
I won't be. 6:00.
I'll be back by 6:00, okay?

28:36.896 --> 28:39.565
"Lisa. I've been trying to find you.

28:39.649 --> 28:42.193
I have your powder case.
Call me at..."

28:47.031 --> 28:48.074
Excuse me?

28:48.157 --> 28:50.076
What can I do for you?

28:52.370 --> 28:54.747
I found a hotel key
in the back yesterday.

28:54.831 --> 28:56.874
A woman left it.
I don't know if you saw her.

28:57.792 --> 29:00.920
She fell right over there.
Broke her heel.

29:01.003 --> 29:02.964
Yesterday?
Yeah, that's right. I remember.

29:03.047 --> 29:05.133
You wanted to leave
the keys with me?

29:05.216 --> 29:07.135
No. Actually, I, uh...

29:07.218 --> 29:09.512
could you give her this note
if she comes back in here?

29:09.595 --> 29:11.180
- No problem.
- Thanks a lot.

29:11.264 --> 29:12.414
Sure.

30:16.245 --> 30:17.395
Lisa!

30:19.123 --> 30:20.273
Lisa!

31:28.776 --> 31:31.779
"Lisa. I returned your key
as you asked.

31:31.863 --> 31:35.324
"You must let me see you
if only for one last time.

31:35.408 --> 31:37.910
"Call me.
My heart can't stand it.

31:38.661 --> 31:40.997
All my love. Daniel."

32:55.446 --> 32:56.596
Shit.

33:23.975 --> 33:25.643
- Ass.
- I'm so sorry.

33:25.727 --> 33:27.895
- Hey, I could explain.
- You are an asshole.

33:27.979 --> 33:30.106
Do me a favor...
Don't ask me for any more favors.

33:30.189 --> 33:31.858
Come on.
Luke...

33:33.317 --> 33:35.820
I found her. I think I found her.
I found her apartment, anyway.

33:35.903 --> 33:37.572
I'm really happy for you, Matty.

33:37.655 --> 33:40.616
I left a note under her door
to meet me at the park tomorrow.

33:40.658 --> 33:42.952
Guess you guys
should have a picnic.

33:43.035 --> 33:45.079
Jesus, man.

33:45.163 --> 33:47.623
My entire evening is screwed.

33:47.665 --> 33:49.709
Look, I'm not really
that late, brother.

33:49.792 --> 33:53.755
Alex doesn't wait for anyone. Trust me.
I've already left three messages.

33:54.505 --> 33:56.132
Well, why didn't you take a cab?

33:56.215 --> 33:59.051
'Cause I was waiting for you.
I was waiting for my car.

33:59.969 --> 34:02.555
Luke, it's not that late.

34:02.638 --> 34:05.892
Go over there? And do what?
Throw little pebbles up at her window?

34:06.642 --> 34:09.312
She's gone. It's over.
Just forget it.

34:11.355 --> 34:12.505
Maybe not.

34:17.820 --> 34:20.489
I hope, for our friendship,
this is who I want it to be.

34:20.531 --> 34:22.658
Want to see how cool I am?
Three rings.

34:25.411 --> 34:26.746
Hello?

34:26.829 --> 34:28.748
Hey, how's it goin'?

34:28.831 --> 34:31.501
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Did you get my messages?

34:32.502 --> 34:36.214
No, I lent my car to my buddy Matt,
and he was a little late coming home.

34:37.547 --> 34:40.384
No, sure. He's right here.
Hold on a sec.

34:40.467 --> 34:41.803
She wants to talk to you.

34:42.844 --> 34:45.181
Fix it.
You have to fix it.

34:48.893 --> 34:50.043
Hello?

34:50.645 --> 34:52.813
He's full of shit. Isn't he?

34:52.897 --> 34:54.899
Yeah, he's full of shit, all right.

34:54.982 --> 34:56.317
Yeah. I knew it.

34:57.693 --> 35:01.406
He didn't lend me his car. I took it.

35:01.489 --> 35:02.740
I stole his keys.

35:02.824 --> 35:04.325
That's good.

35:04.409 --> 35:05.910
Why would you do that?

35:07.662 --> 35:09.163
Because I'm a selfish idiot.

35:10.456 --> 35:13.292
And I had this whole thing
going on that...

35:14.419 --> 35:16.003
I don't wanna bore you with it.

35:16.087 --> 35:17.237
Please. I insist.

35:18.798 --> 35:19.948
Okay.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.969
Well, um...

35:23.928 --> 35:27.056
I was looking for somebody.
A woman.

35:28.141 --> 35:29.308
I wasn't thinking.

35:29.392 --> 35:31.227
Got a little desperate.

35:31.269 --> 35:33.104
Oh. I'm sorry.

35:33.187 --> 35:34.355
No.

35:34.439 --> 35:36.357
I should be apologizing to you.

35:37.442 --> 35:41.070
And I am apologizing to you.
I'm very sorry that I ruined your evening.

35:41.863 --> 35:43.197
Did you find her?

35:44.532 --> 35:47.577
I think so. Yeah.
I found where she lives.

35:47.660 --> 35:49.996
Well. You should go back.
And you should look for her.

35:50.788 --> 35:52.081
I think I will. Thanks.

35:52.165 --> 35:53.833
You're boring now.
Give me the phone.

35:53.916 --> 35:55.585
- Okay, Alex. I gotta go.
- Nice to talk to you.

35:55.626 --> 35:57.462
Nice to talk to you, too.
Bye-bye.

35:58.087 --> 35:59.338
She's nice, man.

35:59.422 --> 36:00.572
Thanks.

36:01.299 --> 36:02.449
Hello?

36:07.805 --> 36:10.683
Okay. Why don't I just...
I'll pick you up at the theater.

36:27.283 --> 36:29.619
I think not so, my lord.

36:29.660 --> 36:31.662
Dear lad, believe it,

36:31.746 --> 36:36.250
for they shall yet belie thy happy years
to say thou art a man.

36:36.334 --> 36:37.484
Prosper well in this,

36:37.543 --> 36:40.171
and thou shalt live as freely as thy lord
to call his fortunes thine.

36:40.254 --> 36:42.632
I'll do my best to woo your lady...

36:43.299 --> 36:45.134
and yet a barful strife.

36:45.176 --> 36:47.929
Whoe'er I woo, myself
would be his wife.

36:48.012 --> 36:50.264
Alex, what's going on?

36:52.350 --> 36:53.500
What do you mean?

36:53.559 --> 36:56.062
Well, I'm sitting in the audience
and I'm getting nothing.

36:56.729 --> 36:59.899
I figured maybe I'm missing something,
so I come, I take a closer look.

36:59.982 --> 37:02.110
But you know what?
I'm still not buying it.

37:02.193 --> 37:04.237
What the hell's
the matter with you today?

37:05.655 --> 37:09.367
Look, the line, "Whoe'er I woo,

37:09.450 --> 37:11.285
defines your character.

37:11.369 --> 37:12.745
You're in love with this guy,

37:12.829 --> 37:16.499
and he is asking you
to help him get another woman!

37:16.541 --> 37:20.670
You're upset, you're confused,
it's tearing you up inside!

37:20.711 --> 37:23.714
We've gotta see the love,
but we've also gotta see the agony.

37:24.549 --> 37:26.509
You have been in love before,

37:29.470 --> 37:31.180
Yes. Sure.

37:31.264 --> 37:35.017
Oh, good. Well, please,
share a little something with us, huh?

37:36.894 --> 37:41.274
God. You sound so close.
Can't believe you're 7.000 miles away.

37:41.357 --> 37:42.942
I know.
It's crazy, isn't it?

37:44.110 --> 37:45.778
How's the weather?

37:45.862 --> 37:47.822
I don't know.
It's still dark out.

37:47.905 --> 37:50.241
Isn't it. Like.
10: 00 in the morning there?

37:52.076 --> 37:53.411
I... you know what?

37:53.494 --> 37:57.331
I'm so zonked, I didn't

37:57.373 --> 38:00.793
you know what... it's actually a really
nice day out, now that I see it.

38:00.877 --> 38:02.712
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

38:03.588 --> 38:05.923
No. I'm just a little out of it,
that's all.

38:06.007 --> 38:09.594
Well. You better get in it. Because
today's meeting is very important.

38:09.677 --> 38:12.346
You'll be fine. Honey.
I'll speak to you later. Okay?

38:12.388 --> 38:14.223
I miss you.
Bye.

38:14.307 --> 38:15.641
Bye.

38:45.213 --> 38:48.049
"Lisa. I found your powder case.

38:48.132 --> 38:49.425
"I have to see you.

38:50.301 --> 38:52.762
"Meet me tomorrow at 3: 00.
Our usual spot.

38:53.805 --> 38:54.955
Matt."

40:06.377 --> 40:07.527
Hello?

40:17.138 --> 40:18.288
Lisa?

41:22.453 --> 41:23.603
Fuck.

42:30.021 --> 42:31.314
Lisa?

42:41.199 --> 42:43.659
Jesus Christ!
I'm sorry. It's okay.

42:43.701 --> 42:45.495
I'm calling the police!
Where's the phone?

42:45.578 --> 42:48.039
No! Don't call the police!
I'm not gonna hurt you.

42:48.122 --> 42:50.583
- Get away from me!
- Okay! Okay! Calm down!

42:50.666 --> 42:52.543
Calm down. It's okay.

42:52.627 --> 42:54.128
I'm a friend of Lisa's.

42:54.796 --> 42:56.255
A friend of Lisa's?

42:56.339 --> 42:57.507
Yeah.

42:57.548 --> 42:59.175
Is that supposed to be funny?

42:59.258 --> 43:02.929
No. You can ask her
when she comes, okay?

43:03.012 --> 43:05.890
I'm Lisa.
I live here.

43:09.185 --> 43:10.353
Your name's Lisa?

43:10.395 --> 43:11.545
Yeah.

43:14.273 --> 43:15.691
And you live here?

43:15.733 --> 43:17.068
Yeah.

43:19.987 --> 43:21.137
No...

43:23.950 --> 43:25.785
- I'm calling the cops.
- No, wait. Don't.

43:27.537 --> 43:29.122
Hey, you see that letter there?

43:32.083 --> 43:34.252
- You wrote that?
- Yeah.

43:35.128 --> 43:37.130
You were at Bellucci's on Monday.

43:39.132 --> 43:41.134
Yeah... I was.

43:41.217 --> 43:43.761
And you had a room at The Drake,
room 679?

43:44.846 --> 43:45.996
Yeah.

43:46.723 --> 43:48.307
How'd you know that?

43:54.647 --> 43:56.232
I can't believe I did this.

43:57.150 --> 43:59.193
I'm going crazy. Here.

44:00.153 --> 44:01.821
That's yours.

44:04.115 --> 44:05.265
It's broken.

44:06.117 --> 44:08.786
I'd be happy to pay for it.
You know, my bad luck.

44:09.370 --> 44:10.520
Wait.

44:11.706 --> 44:12.874
Your hand.

44:13.708 --> 44:14.959
It's bleeding.

44:16.210 --> 44:17.920
It's all right.

44:18.755 --> 44:19.797
I got this.

44:19.881 --> 44:23.217
No, I...

44:27.138 --> 44:28.288
Okay.

44:28.931 --> 44:30.081
Thank you.

44:33.811 --> 44:35.146
You know, at the restaurant,

44:35.229 --> 44:37.732
I would've bet anything
you were this girl I used to know.

44:41.110 --> 44:45.073
But now seeing you here, you don't
really look that much like her at all.

44:47.283 --> 44:48.493
Must be hallucinating.

44:51.204 --> 44:52.747
I was crazy about her.

44:58.878 --> 45:02.465
So, what about the, uh...

45:02.548 --> 45:05.551
- Daniel.
- Yeah. What's his story?

45:08.763 --> 45:10.765
He's been stalking me.

45:10.807 --> 45:13.643
He scares the hell out of me.

45:13.726 --> 45:18.064
That's why I was staying in the hotel...
Because I didn't want him to find me.

45:19.524 --> 45:21.192
I hope he didn't follow you here.

45:23.444 --> 45:25.029
I don't think so. No.

45:26.239 --> 45:27.782
How's your hand?

45:28.741 --> 45:30.243
It's okay.

45:30.326 --> 45:32.537
I wasn't even hungry or anything.

45:33.830 --> 45:35.081
Actually, you know what?

45:36.124 --> 45:37.458
Thank you for everything.

45:38.292 --> 45:39.442
For the bandage...

45:41.170 --> 45:42.964
not calling the cops...

45:43.548 --> 45:47.051
not beating me to death
with the little bronze ballerina, or...

45:49.721 --> 45:51.139
You're leaving?

45:52.181 --> 45:53.331
Yeah.

45:54.851 --> 45:56.310
I'm late, you know.

45:57.395 --> 46:00.690
Very late, actually, for China, so...

46:01.774 --> 46:03.776
China. That's funny.

46:04.861 --> 46:06.529
That's what my friend said, too.

46:09.449 --> 46:11.117
Well, maybe you should wait.

46:12.034 --> 46:15.329
I can't. I mean...
I gotta go.

46:15.371 --> 46:19.208
Do you really think planes
are still taking off this late?

46:25.089 --> 46:26.883
What are you doing?

46:30.094 --> 46:31.262
I'm scared.

46:32.305 --> 46:33.556
Of him.

46:34.849 --> 46:38.519
I haven't stayed alone here
since his wife died, and...

46:40.938 --> 46:42.440
Would you mind if you stayed?

46:45.735 --> 46:48.571
Lisa, you don't even know me.
I broke into your apartment...

46:48.654 --> 46:50.490
I know. I know. I know.

46:50.573 --> 46:54.410
But... don't take this the wrong way,
but I just think you're a nice guy.

46:54.494 --> 46:55.828
That's all.

47:03.795 --> 47:04.945
Okay.

47:06.964 --> 47:08.049
Good.

47:08.091 --> 47:09.759
Where does a nice guy sleep?

47:10.593 --> 47:13.179
A nice guy sleeps on the couch.

47:52.260 --> 47:53.594
What are you doing?

47:54.971 --> 47:56.305
I'm watching you sleep.

48:30.673 --> 48:31.823
Lisa!

48:41.684 --> 48:43.352
Hey, how are you?

48:44.062 --> 48:45.730
What are you doing here?

48:45.813 --> 48:47.148
I gotta talk to you.

48:48.066 --> 48:49.525
Now?

48:49.609 --> 48:51.277
Yeah, it's kind of important.

48:52.111 --> 48:54.947
Wanna go get a drink or something?
It's freezing out here.

48:55.031 --> 48:56.866
- Okay.
- Okay? Come on.

48:58.493 --> 49:04.123
My friend gave my stuff
to this head of the agency, and...

49:04.207 --> 49:05.374
he liked it.

49:05.416 --> 49:06.793
So...

49:06.876 --> 49:08.920
he offered me a job in New York.

49:09.003 --> 49:11.089
That's great.

49:13.424 --> 49:15.802
It'll help me pay my rent, but...

49:15.885 --> 49:17.720
But what? Why not?

49:19.180 --> 49:20.330
Move in with me.

49:23.768 --> 49:27.230
I... I know it's only been
a couple of months, but I just, um...

49:28.439 --> 49:30.525
You're the reason
I don't wanna move to New York.

49:31.984 --> 49:33.903
I wanna make my life
here with you.

49:36.864 --> 49:41.202
Look, I'm really late for rehearsal.
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

49:45.164 --> 49:46.314
Sure.

49:47.208 --> 49:49.585
Matthew, trust me, okay?

49:49.627 --> 49:52.130
Just meet me tomorrow
in the park. Same time.

49:54.757 --> 49:55.907
Bye.

50:31.210 --> 50:32.962
Have you seen Lisa?

50:33.004 --> 50:34.297
Lisa?

50:34.338 --> 50:36.340
She's gone on a European tour
of Cabaret.

50:37.175 --> 50:38.342
It all happened real fast.

50:38.426 --> 50:41.596
They came to our rehearsal and
just picked her out, and she was gone.

50:43.347 --> 50:47.685
Like... did she say anything
before she left?

50:48.394 --> 50:49.544
Like what?

50:50.563 --> 50:51.713
Like, uh...

50:55.276 --> 50:56.652
Cool. Thanks.

50:56.736 --> 50:57.886
Okay.

52:43.259 --> 52:44.409
- Hi.
- Hi.

52:54.437 --> 52:56.105
You want a cup of coffee?

52:56.189 --> 52:57.857
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

53:19.212 --> 53:20.362
No.

53:21.130 --> 53:22.280
No.

53:25.927 --> 53:27.077
No.

53:27.887 --> 53:29.037
Yeah.

53:38.981 --> 53:40.691
He broke all my cups.

53:42.902 --> 53:44.070
That's original.

53:47.907 --> 53:49.492
Sugar?

53:49.575 --> 53:51.035
Thanks. Yeah.

53:58.459 --> 53:59.609
Thank you.

54:00.253 --> 54:01.403
To us.

54:26.487 --> 54:27.637
Leaving?

54:28.239 --> 54:30.491
Yeah. I have to go to work.

54:31.784 --> 54:33.161
I'm due at the hospital.

54:34.370 --> 54:35.872
That's right.
You're a nurse.

54:35.955 --> 54:37.665
I got a double shift.

54:44.505 --> 54:46.382
You should stay.

54:50.303 --> 54:51.721
You have a key?

54:51.804 --> 54:52.954
Yeah.

54:54.182 --> 54:55.975
Well, I should be back by 10:00.

54:57.935 --> 54:59.520
Will I see you later?

55:01.939 --> 55:03.089
Maybe.

55:04.108 --> 55:05.258
Yeah.

55:13.785 --> 55:15.119
- Bye.
- Bye.

55:27.340 --> 55:29.217
You were at Bellucci's on Monday.

55:30.843 --> 55:33.262
Yeah. I was.

55:37.850 --> 55:39.000
Hello?

55:39.852 --> 55:41.354
What happened to you?

55:43.147 --> 55:45.483
Hang on.
Just a minute!

55:46.192 --> 55:48.653
Look, could I stay at your place
for a couple of days?

55:48.736 --> 55:50.571
- Yeah. Of course.
- Great.

55:50.655 --> 55:53.324
Well, I've gotta call Daniel first,
then I'll be right over.

55:53.366 --> 55:54.700
- Okay.
- Bye.

56:04.001 --> 56:05.151
Lisa!

56:08.256 --> 56:10.007
Oh, shit. Get up.

57:18.409 --> 57:19.786
You know.
At the restaurant.

57:19.869 --> 57:22.371
I would've bet anything
you were this girl I used to know.

57:23.289 --> 57:27.293
But now seeing you here. You don't
really look that much like her at all.

58:00.493 --> 58:01.869
Hi.

58:25.977 --> 58:28.813
Come on, Lisa.

58:29.856 --> 58:32.525
Don't start shit like that.
Look, I don't have time...

58:32.608 --> 58:34.277
I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

58:34.360 --> 58:36.988
Stop acting like a goddamn child
about this crap!

58:37.029 --> 58:38.990
Stop screaming at me!

58:39.031 --> 58:42.493
Lisa, what are you doing?
Jesus Christ. Be careful.

58:42.577 --> 58:45.037
It's over. Get out of my house.

58:45.079 --> 58:46.956
Stop! Enough!

58:47.039 --> 58:48.875
Get back in here now!

58:48.958 --> 58:51.127
- You're gonna kill yourself!
- Don't do it!

58:51.210 --> 58:52.837
Lisa, stop this!

58:53.421 --> 58:56.174
Is this how you deal
with your problems?

58:56.257 --> 58:58.593
Huh? You run away
and act like a child?

58:58.676 --> 59:01.679
Go home, and don't bother calling me! Ok?

59:01.721 --> 59:02.805
Hi.

59:02.889 --> 59:04.390
- Goddamnit!
- Can I come in?

59:04.474 --> 59:05.725
Of course.

59:07.810 --> 59:09.979
I'm sorry.
I hate to bother you, but, um,

59:10.063 --> 59:14.567
my... ex-boyfriend just told me
he's seeing someone else.

59:14.650 --> 59:16.486
I took a chance.
I hope you don't mind.

59:16.569 --> 59:17.987
No, not at all.

59:18.071 --> 59:20.114
Lisa, this is stupid, all right?
Come on!

59:20.198 --> 59:21.741
Go home!

59:25.036 --> 59:27.413
Excuse me, are you leaving?
I'd like to park.

59:43.805 --> 59:45.473
- Hey!
- Hey.

59:51.646 --> 59:53.606
I'm sorry I didn't call.
I, um...

59:54.399 --> 59:56.526
Don't worry.
I've just been thinking.

59:57.693 --> 59:59.028
Are you okay?

01:00:01.114 --> 01:00:02.657
I'm going to London.

01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:04.075
Why?

01:00:04.992 --> 01:00:07.161
A friend of mine
started his own company.

01:00:07.245 --> 01:00:08.746
He's asked me to choreograph.

01:00:08.788 --> 01:00:11.791
Oh, my God.
That's amazing.

01:00:11.874 --> 01:00:13.543
When do you leave?

01:00:13.626 --> 01:00:14.961
Tomorrow afternoon.

01:00:15.002 --> 01:00:16.963
Is it okay
if I stay another night?

01:00:17.004 --> 01:00:18.172
Of course.

01:00:18.256 --> 01:00:20.299
No, it has to be tonight.

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:23.219
Well, then I'd say
the 10:15 flight to Los Angeles

01:00:23.302 --> 01:00:24.762
would be your best bet.

01:00:24.846 --> 01:00:27.014
You can catch the flight
to Shanghai from there.

01:00:27.098 --> 01:00:30.226
But there's only coach available;
Your ticket's for first.

01:00:30.309 --> 01:00:31.459
It's okay.

01:00:33.646 --> 01:00:34.796
I'll tell you what.

01:00:34.856 --> 01:00:36.858
I think I can get you an upgrade.

01:00:36.941 --> 01:00:39.610
Why don't you come back
in a few hours. Around 4:00.

01:00:39.652 --> 01:00:42.029
Something should've
opened up by then.

01:00:42.113 --> 01:00:43.263
Okay.

01:00:43.781 --> 01:00:45.616
Thank you.
See you at 4:00.

01:01:06.054 --> 01:01:08.056
The hotel thing was just stupid.

01:01:09.223 --> 01:01:11.392
I knew Daniel would find me.

01:01:14.687 --> 01:01:15.837
So...

01:01:18.024 --> 01:01:19.442
Why don't you come with me?

01:01:23.071 --> 01:01:26.324
Well, I've got great shifts
at the hospital now,

01:01:26.365 --> 01:01:28.868
and, you know...

01:01:28.951 --> 01:01:30.620
And the guy who gave you that.

01:01:31.412 --> 01:01:33.247
Yeah.

01:01:36.542 --> 01:01:38.377
Well, come on. Tell me!

01:01:40.296 --> 01:01:44.342
Last night we did it
on the sofa in the doctor's lounge.

01:01:44.425 --> 01:01:46.344
You little slut.
I'm jealous!

01:01:46.385 --> 01:01:48.888
The bad part is
I'm already seeing his best friend.

01:01:49.847 --> 01:01:51.224
Another surgeon.

01:01:52.058 --> 01:01:56.104
He's adorable and he adores me,

01:01:56.437 --> 01:02:01.526
So she had the same name,

01:02:01.567 --> 01:02:03.569
That's so hot.

01:02:03.653 --> 01:02:06.447
Or... or maybe this is creepy.

01:02:06.531 --> 01:02:08.699
I think it's a little bit of both, actually.

01:02:09.909 --> 01:02:11.059
So, did you hit it?

01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:16.541
No. Um... I slept on the couch,
you know.

01:02:16.582 --> 01:02:18.418
When I woke up
in the morning, she was gone.

01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:20.420
- But you wanted to hit it, didn't you?
- Come on.

01:02:20.503 --> 01:02:21.546
Come on.

01:02:21.629 --> 01:02:25.258
I'm going to China tonight, I'm practically
engaged... do I need to remind you?

01:02:25.341 --> 01:02:27.051
The lies we tell ourselves.

01:02:29.262 --> 01:02:31.514
So, what about you and Alex...
How's that?

01:02:31.597 --> 01:02:33.057
How was your date?

01:02:34.434 --> 01:02:36.769
- It was great.
- Good.

01:02:36.853 --> 01:02:38.896
I mean, what...

01:02:39.772 --> 01:02:41.065
I don't know. Sure.

01:02:42.942 --> 01:02:46.946
Well. After I left you. I went
to pick up Alex from the theater. Right?

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:52.034
She has this director... the guy is
such a cheese ball. Not that impressive.

01:02:52.118 --> 01:02:56.247
I mean. She should be on Broadway
or something. 'Cause she was awesome.

01:02:56.289 --> 01:02:59.041
It was super late
by the time she got changed.

01:03:23.274 --> 01:03:26.944
So we went out.
Had a couple drinks and a couple laughs.

01:03:26.986 --> 01:03:30.656
On the way home. I told her the whole
sordid story about you and Lisa.

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.909
So now, finally, he's found her.

01:03:34.327 --> 01:03:35.953
- Wow.
- Yeah.

01:03:37.997 --> 01:03:40.875
And did she explain
why she disappeared?

01:03:40.958 --> 01:03:42.877
No, not yet.
He just wrote her this note.

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:46.130
They haven't actually spoken,
but they're supposed to speak soon.

01:03:53.388 --> 01:03:54.538
You okay?

01:03:57.683 --> 01:04:01.604
No, I'm not. You know, I don't...

01:04:03.147 --> 01:04:04.315
You're kidding me.

01:04:05.149 --> 01:04:06.299
No.

01:04:06.943 --> 01:04:09.112
Do you mind just taking me home?

01:04:13.366 --> 01:04:14.700
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:04:15.493 --> 01:04:16.661
Thanks.

01:04:30.007 --> 01:04:33.678
So, I was thinking,
maybe I could go upstairs with you

01:04:33.719 --> 01:04:37.890
and I'll make you
a nice big cup of hot chocolate...

01:04:39.225 --> 01:04:41.352
put a bunch
of little marshmallows up on top.

01:04:41.436 --> 01:04:43.771
We'll watch TV and just hang out.

01:04:44.689 --> 01:04:46.274
Do you love me?

01:04:49.235 --> 01:04:50.987
I just wanna be alone.

01:04:52.405 --> 01:04:53.823
- Well...
- I'll call you.

01:04:53.906 --> 01:04:55.366
I'll call you tomorrow.

01:04:56.451 --> 01:04:58.703
Alex.
Alex, wait a second.

01:04:58.786 --> 01:05:00.246
You gotta be kidding me.

01:05:00.288 --> 01:05:02.373
This girl's unbelievable.

01:05:02.457 --> 01:05:04.041
You know what?
Don't call me, okay?

01:05:04.125 --> 01:05:06.919
Don't call me until you figure out
what you wanna do with your life,

01:05:07.003 --> 01:05:08.421
'cause I can't deal with this.

01:05:08.463 --> 01:05:11.132
Every time, it's a different story
with you, all right?

01:05:15.303 --> 01:05:16.804
Wait, I... I'm sorry.

01:05:17.638 --> 01:05:18.806
I'll call you tomorrow.

01:05:20.516 --> 01:05:21.684
God!

01:05:24.854 --> 01:05:28.191
This girl is ridiculous.

01:05:46.667 --> 01:05:47.835
Taxi!

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.767
And we had sex all night.

01:06:02.809 --> 01:06:04.477
And the next morning.

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:07.522
I made her my dad's
world-famous breakfast, and...

01:06:07.605 --> 01:06:09.273
I don't know.
It was pretty perfect.

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.735
That sounds really good, man.

01:06:12.819 --> 01:06:13.969
It was pretty good.

01:06:14.028 --> 01:06:15.363
When do I get to meet her?

01:06:17.532 --> 01:06:18.682
Tonight.

01:06:19.492 --> 01:06:21.994
Yeah, tonight. Tonight is her...
She's got this play.

01:06:22.078 --> 01:06:24.580
It's the big opening.
It's Shakespeare.

01:06:25.331 --> 01:06:26.416
Shakespeare.

01:06:26.499 --> 01:06:29.585
Shakespeare. I know.
But it's supposed to be good. Trust me.

01:06:31.879 --> 01:06:33.464
I'm supposed to leave tonight.

01:06:33.548 --> 01:06:34.715
Yeah, but it's early.

01:06:34.799 --> 01:06:36.717
You can go to the play,
then get on the plane.

01:06:42.223 --> 01:06:45.893
Have you seen my compact?
You know, the silver one.

01:06:46.436 --> 01:06:48.771
No, I haven't.

01:06:51.607 --> 01:06:53.776
I hope I didn't leave it
at the hotel.

01:06:55.153 --> 01:06:57.155
It was a gift from my grandmother.

01:07:04.078 --> 01:07:05.913
Where did you get this?

01:07:07.749 --> 01:07:11.002
Um... it's surgeon number two's.

01:07:11.085 --> 01:07:12.920
He left it here last week.

01:07:14.881 --> 01:07:16.549
Oh, my God.
It's so much like...

01:07:17.967 --> 01:07:19.218
What?

01:07:22.305 --> 01:07:23.639
Matthew.

01:07:36.235 --> 01:07:38.446
So you're not getting
into too much trouble?

01:07:39.864 --> 01:07:40.907
Thanks.

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:42.533
Take care of yourself, okay?

01:08:31.541 --> 01:08:34.042
- Come on, let me film you.
- No. You first.

01:08:34.127 --> 01:08:38.339
Come on, Alex. Are you shy? You can't
be shy if you wanna be an actress.

01:08:38.423 --> 01:08:39.465
Here.

01:08:39.549 --> 01:08:42.260
- Shakespeare?
- This is your big break.

01:08:42.343 --> 01:08:44.845
That's Shakespeare.
I can't do that. That's too hard.

01:08:44.929 --> 01:08:47.432
Haply, when I shall wed.

01:08:47.473 --> 01:08:49.975
That lord whose hand
must take my plight

01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:54.397
shall carry half my love with him,
half my care and duty.

01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:59.109
Surely I shall never marry
like my sisters to love my father all.

01:09:00.027 --> 01:09:04.615
So true, my lord.
In life... oh! I blew it.

01:09:04.657 --> 01:09:06.325
I'm sorry. That was bad.

01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:09.828
No, that was amazing.

01:09:09.912 --> 01:09:12.957
You know, the thing with acting, Alex,
is you just have to commit.

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.792
Otherwise, you're just a phony.

01:09:19.546 --> 01:09:20.798
I can't hear anything.

01:09:20.881 --> 01:09:22.049
I know.

01:09:23.509 --> 01:09:24.658
That's weird.

01:09:29.098 --> 01:09:31.309
- Is it hooked up right?
- Yeah.

01:09:31.392 --> 01:09:33.144
Can you take it back?

01:09:34.353 --> 01:09:36.731
I know a place
I can get it fixed, actually.

01:09:40.443 --> 01:09:42.987
Do you believe
in love at first sight?

01:09:43.029 --> 01:09:44.322
Well, who is he?

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:48.242
Don't even try to lie about it.

01:09:48.868 --> 01:09:51.996
I haven't met him yet.
I've just seen him.

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.749
I don't think he's got a girlfriend.
I can tell.

01:09:54.832 --> 01:09:56.918
Don't wait.
The good ones go fast.

01:09:57.668 --> 01:10:01.005
Well, I gotta go get the video camera,
so I'll talk to you later.

01:10:01.047 --> 01:10:02.197
All right.

01:10:02.256 --> 01:10:05.218
Hey... promise you'll talk to him?

01:10:06.385 --> 01:10:08.513
Yeah... I'll think about it.

01:10:08.596 --> 01:10:10.139
Okay. Bye.

01:10:51.889 --> 01:10:52.932
I'll be right back.

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:54.934
- Sorry.
- Matthew, where are you going?

01:10:55.017 --> 01:10:56.352
Sorry.

01:11:24.797 --> 01:11:27.508
My God.
It's so much like... Matthew.

01:11:29.135 --> 01:11:30.285
Don't be silly.

01:11:30.344 --> 01:11:32.805
It belongs to one of the doctors
at the hospital.

01:11:34.766 --> 01:11:36.934
Why would you think of Matthew?

01:11:43.316 --> 01:11:46.110
Could I borrow
your car again tonight?

01:11:46.194 --> 01:11:47.344
Oh, sure.

01:11:48.988 --> 01:11:50.198
Thanks, Lisa.

01:11:51.157 --> 01:11:54.285
Well, I better go.
I'll see you later.

01:11:54.368 --> 01:11:55.536
Okay.

01:12:00.333 --> 01:12:02.293
Hi, excuse me?

01:12:02.376 --> 01:12:05.963
I think I might have left a compact.
It's silver, engraved.

01:12:06.005 --> 01:12:07.507
Um, let me ask.

01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:10.843
Tony, did anyone turn in
a silver compact?

01:12:10.927 --> 01:12:12.345
No. Sorry.

01:12:12.386 --> 01:12:14.138
Okay. Thank you.

01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:15.330
Lisa?

01:12:16.849 --> 01:12:18.184
Yeah?

01:12:18.267 --> 01:12:21.979
A guy did come in here looking for you.
Said he found your keys. Oh! And...

01:12:25.149 --> 01:12:26.317
He left you this.

01:12:26.359 --> 01:12:27.652
- Thank you.
- Sure.

01:12:31.656 --> 01:12:34.325
"Lisa. I've been trying to find you.

01:12:34.367 --> 01:12:36.160
"I have your powder case.

01:12:36.244 --> 01:12:37.745
"Call me.

01:12:37.829 --> 01:12:38.996
Matthew."

01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:31.716
Hey, Luke, can I talk to you
for a second?

01:13:32.675 --> 01:13:35.011
Hey, Ellie, do me a favor.
Will you help her out?

01:13:35.094 --> 01:13:36.244
Yeah, sure.

01:13:36.304 --> 01:13:37.472
How's it goin'?

01:13:37.555 --> 01:13:39.932
Hey. I just wanna say thanks
for everything

01:13:40.016 --> 01:13:42.226
and, you know,
you've been great.

01:13:42.268 --> 01:13:44.604
What about the play?
I thought you were comin' to the play.

01:13:45.897 --> 01:13:48.566
I don't wanna miss
another flight, you know.

01:13:48.608 --> 01:13:51.360
Listen, I'll make it up to you
when I get back. I promise.

01:13:52.653 --> 01:13:53.863
Hey, taxi!

01:13:54.614 --> 01:13:57.909
You have fun tonight, though, all right?
Say hi to Alex for me, and, you know.

01:13:57.992 --> 01:13:59.952
- You're a lucky guy.
- You got plenty of time.

01:13:59.994 --> 01:14:03.331
It's the late flight. I really want you
to come to the play. Please?

01:14:03.414 --> 01:14:06.459
See, things, um... it's just not going
that well with Alex.

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:08.795
I've been kind of
exaggerating a little.

01:14:09.337 --> 01:14:10.797
What do you mean?

01:14:10.838 --> 01:14:12.006
Well...

01:14:12.090 --> 01:14:14.425
Lying.
Uh! I've been lying!

01:14:14.467 --> 01:14:16.094
It's 'cause my life's so pathetic.

01:14:16.135 --> 01:14:17.470
No all-night marathon?

01:14:17.553 --> 01:14:19.972
God, I'm lucky if I get a kiss
at the end of the night.

01:14:20.014 --> 01:14:23.643
So I was thinking that if you came
to the play, I think that would really help.

01:14:23.726 --> 01:14:26.437
I mean, I'd be so much more
confident with you there.

01:14:26.521 --> 01:14:29.482
And then I can go to the bathroom
and you can tell her,

01:14:29.524 --> 01:14:31.192
you know, what a great guy I am

01:14:31.275 --> 01:14:34.195
and rumor has it I'm really good
in the sack, and that, um...

01:14:34.278 --> 01:14:36.656
I'm hung like a camel...
I don't know.

01:14:38.408 --> 01:14:40.993
Please? I wouldn't ask
if it didn't mean a lot to me.

01:14:41.077 --> 01:14:44.038
- I'll be there.
- Oh, you're the best. Thanks, buddy.

01:14:44.747 --> 01:14:45.915
7:30, all right?

01:14:45.998 --> 01:14:48.126
- I got it.
- Good. There you go.

01:14:48.209 --> 01:14:49.877
- See you, brother.
- Yeah.

01:14:51.671 --> 01:14:53.005
You the man. Thanks, man.

01:14:53.089 --> 01:14:57.009
Well, you're all set.
You're on flight 1559. First class.

01:14:57.927 --> 01:14:59.077
Have a good trip.

01:15:00.054 --> 01:15:01.389
I will. Thanks a lot.

01:15:22.410 --> 01:15:24.579
Um, I'm booked in a flight
to London today.

01:15:24.662 --> 01:15:27.165
I'd like to postpone it
until tomorrow, please.

01:15:30.918 --> 01:15:33.755
Those shoes.
The black ones with the red sole.

01:15:33.838 --> 01:15:35.715
I'd like to try them on. Please.

01:16:00.865 --> 01:16:05.369
Oh, excuse me, dear. Could you tell me
how to get to this museum from here?

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:09.582
I think it's...

01:16:11.417 --> 01:16:12.919
I think it's back here.

01:16:15.630 --> 01:16:18.007
- Let me show you. I'll walk you.
- Oh, thank you.

01:16:47.453 --> 01:16:49.038
Alex, ten minutes!

01:16:49.789 --> 01:16:51.624
This is it right up here.

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.962
- Here. Keep the change.
- Thanks.

01:16:56.963 --> 01:16:58.113
Thanks.

01:17:05.096 --> 01:17:08.808
How much better that man should fall
before the lion than the wolf.

01:17:09.684 --> 01:17:12.520
The clock upbraids me
with the waste of time.

01:17:14.147 --> 01:17:17.316
Be not afraid, good youth.
I will not have you.

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:19.402
And yet when wit and youth
is come to harvest,

01:17:19.485 --> 01:17:21.946
your wife is like
to reap a proper man.

01:17:22.029 --> 01:17:23.197
I'm right here. Sorry.

01:17:23.281 --> 01:17:24.782
There lies your way.
Due west.

01:17:24.866 --> 01:17:25.950
Excuse me.

01:17:25.992 --> 01:17:30.621
Then westward ho. Grace and
good disposition attend your ladyship.

01:17:30.663 --> 01:17:33.750
You'll nothing, madam,
to my lord by me?

01:17:36.335 --> 01:17:37.503
Stay!

01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:40.840
I prithee, tell me
what thou thinkst of me.

01:17:40.923 --> 01:17:43.426
That you do... think...

01:17:49.891 --> 01:17:52.060
Sit down.

01:17:52.143 --> 01:17:53.478
- You are...
- Sorry.

01:17:54.854 --> 01:17:56.481
Not what you are.

01:17:57.648 --> 01:17:59.108
Is that her?

01:17:59.192 --> 01:18:00.693
Yeah, that's my girl.

01:18:03.237 --> 01:18:04.822
Then think you right.

01:18:05.698 --> 01:18:07.200
I am not what I am.

01:18:07.283 --> 01:18:09.619
I would you were
as I would have you be.

01:18:10.703 --> 01:18:13.498
Would it be better,

01:18:14.248 --> 01:18:16.751
I wish it might,
for now I am your fool.

01:18:23.591 --> 01:18:24.926
You're in love with this guy.

01:18:25.009 --> 01:18:27.512
And he is asking you
to help him get another woman!

01:18:27.553 --> 01:18:30.932
You're upset. You're confused.
It's tearing you up inside!

01:18:31.891 --> 01:18:34.185
You have been in love before.
Haven't you?

01:18:43.194 --> 01:18:46.072
By my innocence, I swear,
and by my youth,

01:18:46.114 --> 01:18:49.617
I have one heart,

01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:52.703
And no woman has,

01:18:52.745 --> 01:18:55.373
mistress be of it
to save I alone.

01:18:56.124 --> 01:18:58.793
And so adieu, good madam.

01:18:58.876 --> 01:19:01.796
Nevermore will I my master's tears
to you deplore.

01:19:05.633 --> 01:19:06.843
She's good.

01:19:19.439 --> 01:19:21.566
Look, I should really get
to the airport.

01:19:21.649 --> 01:19:23.818
Yeah. Yeah.
If you have to go, go.

01:19:23.901 --> 01:19:27.780
I'm sure Alex is gonna be disappointed
she didn't get a chance to meet you.

01:19:27.864 --> 01:19:30.116
Tell her she did a great job.
And I'll see you on Monday.

01:19:30.199 --> 01:19:33.119
I will. Hey, Matt, thanks for everything.
It means a lot to me.

01:19:33.911 --> 01:19:35.580
I'm sorry you didn't find Lisa.

01:19:36.289 --> 01:19:37.582
Yeah, me, too.

01:19:39.542 --> 01:19:41.836
- I'll see you around, huh?
- All right, man.

01:20:07.904 --> 01:20:09.322
Hey, Alex.

01:20:09.363 --> 01:20:10.865
Alex, it's me.

01:20:11.824 --> 01:20:13.326
Please go away.

01:20:14.285 --> 01:20:15.787
C'mon, baby. Open the door.

01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:18.706
I don't want your friend
to see me like this.

01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:21.042
He won't. He left.

01:20:22.502 --> 01:20:26.798
What? He left?
Did I scare him away?

01:20:26.839 --> 01:20:28.591
Scare him away?
You blew him away.

01:20:28.674 --> 01:20:32.303
You blew everyone away.
You were unbelievable.

01:20:32.386 --> 01:20:33.805
He just had a plane to catch.

01:20:33.846 --> 01:20:36.849
A slow one to China.
Open the door.

01:20:37.683 --> 01:20:39.060
Did he find her?

01:20:40.019 --> 01:20:41.169
What?

01:20:42.563 --> 01:20:43.981
Your friend... did...

01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:47.402
Did he find Lisa?

01:20:49.654 --> 01:20:54.659
No, it just turned out to be some... psycho
with the same name, same everything.

01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:57.703
He slept on her couch and ran away
as fast as he could.

01:20:59.205 --> 01:21:00.355
Are you okay?

01:21:03.543 --> 01:21:05.336
Alex. You've gotta help me.

01:21:07.004 --> 01:21:08.214
What's wrong?

01:21:08.297 --> 01:21:11.342
Well, I booked this job...
A European tour of Cabaret.

01:21:11.426 --> 01:21:12.927
Oh, wow! That's fantastic!

01:21:13.010 --> 01:21:15.680
I know. Some girl broke her ankle,
I'm taking over.

01:21:15.722 --> 01:21:17.515
But listen, I can't find Matthew.

01:21:17.557 --> 01:21:21.728
I've been looking all over for him,
and my plane's leaving in two hours.

01:21:21.811 --> 01:21:23.813
Did you leave him a message?

01:21:23.896 --> 01:21:26.357
I can't really leave this
on his machine, you know.

01:21:26.441 --> 01:21:28.192
It's too complicated.

01:21:28.276 --> 01:21:31.028
I wrote him a letter.
Do you mind giving it to him?

01:21:32.864 --> 01:21:35.700
I've never even met him.
He doesn't know who I am.

01:21:35.742 --> 01:21:39.078
It doesn't matter... just tell him
you're my friend. It'll be fine.

01:21:39.162 --> 01:21:41.581
You know what,

01:21:41.622 --> 01:21:44.792
just let yourself in
and leave it on his bed.

01:21:46.753 --> 01:21:49.589
I really appreciate this.
Thank you so much.

01:21:49.672 --> 01:21:51.591
Sure. Okay.

01:21:51.674 --> 01:21:52.824
All right.

01:21:56.846 --> 01:21:58.556
He asked me to move in with him.

01:22:00.558 --> 01:22:02.935
Oh. What did you say?

01:22:03.019 --> 01:22:04.562
I didn't really say anything.

01:22:04.645 --> 01:22:07.815
I was late for a class,

01:22:08.649 --> 01:22:12.111
I said I'd meet him tomorrow.
If I don't show up, you know, he'll go nuts.

01:22:12.153 --> 01:22:13.738
Anyway, I have to go.

01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:16.616
Thanks again, and I'll call you
when I get there, okay?

01:22:16.699 --> 01:22:18.826
Are you gonna do it?

01:22:19.869 --> 01:22:22.121
Of course.
I love him.

01:22:24.165 --> 01:22:25.315
Bye.

01:22:25.416 --> 01:22:26.566
Bye.

01:22:59.534 --> 01:23:02.703
Hey. This is Matthew.
Please leave a message.

01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:06.582
Hey. It's me again.

01:23:07.458 --> 01:23:08.918
Where are you?

01:23:09.001 --> 01:23:11.003
Did you get my letter?

01:23:11.087 --> 01:23:12.755
Anyway. I'm in Paris.

01:23:12.839 --> 01:23:15.925
I'm at the hotel. You got
the number in my last message.

01:23:16.008 --> 01:23:18.302
Matt. Please call me.

01:23:18.386 --> 01:23:21.180
This is driving me crazy.
I need to speak to you.

01:23:22.348 --> 01:23:25.393
Look. If you're angry at me.
Then don't be.

01:23:26.144 --> 01:23:29.021
Just call... please.
Bye.

01:24:09.896 --> 01:24:11.856
I don't know
if I can stay with the show.

01:24:11.939 --> 01:24:14.025
I feel like I have to come home
and look for him.

01:24:15.151 --> 01:24:16.486
No, I...

01:24:18.571 --> 01:24:20.865
I wasn't gonna say
anything before, but...

01:24:22.283 --> 01:24:24.494
when I brought him the letter...

01:24:25.661 --> 01:24:27.663
he wasn't expecting me, and...

01:24:30.333 --> 01:24:33.336
I found him in bed
with another woman, Lisa.

01:24:37.632 --> 01:24:39.217
I... I can't believe it.

01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:43.137
Just... forget about him.

01:24:43.221 --> 01:24:46.349
The best thing for you to do
is stay with the show and...

01:24:46.432 --> 01:24:47.725
just forget him.

01:24:52.230 --> 01:24:54.565
I really thought I knew him.

01:24:54.607 --> 01:24:57.110
Just forget him.
He's not even worth it.

01:25:11.290 --> 01:25:13.459
Luke, I'm so sorry.

01:25:13.543 --> 01:25:16.337
No. Shh... it's okay.

01:25:16.421 --> 01:25:18.089
I'm so sorry.

01:25:18.131 --> 01:25:21.092
No. Please, don't apologize.
Please. God.

01:25:23.970 --> 01:25:25.763
I know you're doing the best you can.

01:25:26.806 --> 01:25:27.956
I just...

01:25:32.395 --> 01:25:35.565
I just want you to know that I...
that I love you.

01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:41.279
All right? And I don't
wanna play games anymore.

01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:43.948
What's the point?
I'm just terrible at them anyway.

01:26:40.213 --> 01:26:42.215
Do me a favor.
Grab that, would you?

01:26:45.635 --> 01:26:46.844
Hello?

01:26:48.054 --> 01:26:49.204
Hello?

01:26:49.263 --> 01:26:51.682
- Who's this?
- Who's this?

01:26:51.724 --> 01:26:53.726
This is Matthew.
Who is this?

01:26:55.561 --> 01:26:56.938
Hello?

01:26:57.605 --> 01:26:58.689
Hello?

01:26:58.731 --> 01:27:01.818
Hey, what's up, kid?
I thought you left.

01:27:02.610 --> 01:27:04.070
No, uh...

01:27:05.446 --> 01:27:06.948
What are you still doing here?

01:27:07.031 --> 01:27:09.033
I'm over at the...

01:27:09.117 --> 01:27:10.451
girl's apartment.

01:27:11.285 --> 01:27:13.788
You went back
to the crazy girl's house?

01:27:14.747 --> 01:27:16.374
What the hell are you doing there?

01:27:19.377 --> 01:27:21.712
I'm really starting
to worry about you, man.

01:27:23.047 --> 01:27:24.882
I'm starting to worry myself.

01:27:26.592 --> 01:27:28.094
It's not just that.

01:27:28.678 --> 01:27:30.763
I couldn't even
get on the airplane.

01:27:33.975 --> 01:27:35.143
The thing is...

01:27:36.853 --> 01:27:38.563
there's something
about this apartment.

01:27:44.444 --> 01:27:46.279
It's like Lisa's been here.

01:27:47.488 --> 01:27:50.825
I know this sounds insane. But...

01:27:50.908 --> 01:27:53.077
I think this is her place. Man.

01:27:56.122 --> 01:27:58.791
Well. Maybe you're
just hot for this crazy girl.

01:27:58.875 --> 01:28:02.211
First thing you gotta do is get out
of her apartment and get over here.

01:28:02.295 --> 01:28:04.088
I'll tell you about some stuff. Too.

01:28:04.130 --> 01:28:08.259
I've had the most amazing night
of my entire life last night.

01:28:08.301 --> 01:28:11.471
Okay. I'll be over. Just give me
a couple of minutes. Okay?

01:28:11.554 --> 01:28:13.890
All right. I'll wait.
Later.

01:28:20.855 --> 01:28:22.857
- Hello?
- Hi. um...

01:28:22.940 --> 01:28:25.359
May I speak to Matthew, please?

01:28:27.528 --> 01:28:28.821
Who is this?

01:28:28.905 --> 01:28:31.324
Um... this is Lisa.

01:28:31.365 --> 01:28:34.660
I'm a friend of his.
I'm calling about my compact.

01:28:34.744 --> 01:28:36.412
I think he might have found it.

01:28:36.496 --> 01:28:38.414
Uh... which Lisa is this?

01:28:38.498 --> 01:28:39.791
Pardon me?

01:28:41.667 --> 01:28:43.628
Uh... I'll tell you what...

01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:48.007
He's actually supposed to be here
in a couple of minutes.

01:28:55.848 --> 01:28:56.998
Hello?

01:28:57.058 --> 01:28:58.208
Hello!

01:28:59.143 --> 01:29:00.293
Hi.

01:29:00.353 --> 01:29:01.503
Hi.

01:29:02.647 --> 01:29:04.816
I'm sorry I didn't come back.
My, um...

01:29:05.983 --> 01:29:09.904
double shift turned into a triple,
and I just couldn't get away.

01:29:09.987 --> 01:29:11.823
That's okay.
Don't worry about it.

01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:13.908
Are you mad?

01:29:15.034 --> 01:29:17.286
No. Not at all.
I had a great time.

01:29:18.079 --> 01:29:19.330
Where are you?

01:29:19.414 --> 01:29:22.750
Well, I'm still at work but, um,

01:29:22.834 --> 01:29:24.168
so why don't you wait?

01:29:25.503 --> 01:29:26.712
Yeah, I'll wait.

01:29:26.796 --> 01:29:29.132
Okay. Great.
I'll see you soon.

01:29:31.342 --> 01:29:36.389
Let me. Uh...
let me grab your phone number

01:29:36.472 --> 01:29:39.851
and I will have him call you
when he gets in.

01:29:39.934 --> 01:29:45.606
Um, you know... actually, could you
just tell him to meet me at 3:00?

01:29:45.690 --> 01:29:48.526
He'd know where.
Um, I'll be waiting for him.

01:29:48.568 --> 01:29:50.862
3:00. Okay.

01:29:50.945 --> 01:29:54.198
I... you know what,
it can't be him already,

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:55.742
but I'm expecting him.

01:29:55.825 --> 01:29:58.411
Someone's at my front door.
So maybe it is him.

01:29:58.494 --> 01:29:59.829
So hold on a second.

01:30:07.086 --> 01:30:08.921
Matthew, trust me, okay?

01:30:10.381 --> 01:30:12.425
Meet me tomorrow in the park.
Same time.

01:30:15.595 --> 01:30:16.745
Bye.

01:30:25.438 --> 01:30:27.690
Yeah. I'm sorry.
It wasn't him. It was someone else.

01:30:27.774 --> 01:30:32.028
But I promise you
I will give him your message. Okay?

01:30:32.111 --> 01:30:33.821
Oh. Okay. Thank you.

01:30:39.786 --> 01:30:41.913
I went to get cigarettes.
What's going on?

01:30:43.289 --> 01:30:45.750
Matthew. He didn't leave.

01:30:45.833 --> 01:30:48.669
He went back to that girl's house.
The crazy one.

01:30:48.753 --> 01:30:50.713
Oh, the plot thickens.

01:30:50.797 --> 01:30:52.882
Oh, yeah. It gets even better.
Listen to this.

01:30:52.965 --> 01:30:56.761
So I hang up the phone,
and five seconds later, Lisa called.

01:30:58.179 --> 01:31:01.516
The real Lisa.
The one from two years ago.

01:31:01.599 --> 01:31:02.934
She wants to see him.

01:31:05.478 --> 01:31:06.729
You tell him?

01:31:06.813 --> 01:31:09.732
No, not yet.
I'll wait till he gets here.

01:31:09.816 --> 01:31:12.777
He's gonna be so happy,
he's gonna hit the moon again.

01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:14.028
I have to go!

01:31:14.695 --> 01:31:16.864
- What do you mean?
- I'll call you later. I promise.

01:31:16.948 --> 01:31:19.283
But I made breakfast.
My dad's famous potatoes.

01:31:26.666 --> 01:31:29.043
Lisa called.
She wants to see him.

01:31:31.421 --> 01:31:33.548
So, will you let me
meet your friends?

01:31:33.631 --> 01:31:35.299
Don't you have a store to run?

01:31:35.341 --> 01:31:36.968
Oh, okay.
I can take a hint.

01:31:37.009 --> 01:31:38.636
So we're going out tomorrow, right?

01:31:38.719 --> 01:31:40.722
- 7:00?
- Sure.

01:31:40.805 --> 01:31:41.848
Okay.

01:31:41.931 --> 01:31:44.016
Bye, and thanks for the lift.

01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:45.250
Bye.

01:31:47.854 --> 01:31:49.522
Matty. Hey.
Matty!

01:31:50.606 --> 01:31:52.984
- Matty!
- Luke! Hey, man!

01:31:53.067 --> 01:31:55.319
- How are you, man?
- I'm good. How are you?

01:31:55.403 --> 01:31:56.571
Really good. Really good.

01:32:03.619 --> 01:32:06.873
Oh, excuse me. Could I order an espresso
while I wait for my friend?

01:32:06.956 --> 01:32:08.106
Absolutely.

01:32:14.756 --> 01:32:17.717
He's very impressed
with what you've done.

01:32:17.759 --> 01:32:21.387
And he assures you that
when you get to China...

01:32:22.388 --> 01:32:24.682
with much enthusiasm
and support.

01:32:25.975 --> 01:32:27.477
I'm sitting over here.

01:32:29.353 --> 01:32:30.503
Excuse me. Champagne.

01:32:38.071 --> 01:32:39.221
Excuse you.

01:32:41.657 --> 01:32:42.807
No.

01:32:44.744 --> 01:32:46.913
Uh, Miss Chin,

01:32:49.874 --> 01:32:51.334
Shit, shit, shit!

01:32:51.417 --> 01:32:53.586
As you can see, uh...

01:32:56.798 --> 01:32:58.132
Here, Sweetie...

01:33:08.434 --> 01:33:10.061
Hello. Bellucci's.
May I help you?

01:33:10.103 --> 01:33:12.188
Hello, may I speak
to my friend Lisa, please?

01:33:12.271 --> 01:33:15.066
She's the blonde.
She's sitting at a table behind the bar.

01:33:16.692 --> 01:33:17.860
Yes. Just a minute. Please.

01:33:17.944 --> 01:33:20.613
Excuse me. Are you Lisa?

01:33:21.447 --> 01:33:22.490
Phone's for you.

01:33:22.573 --> 01:33:25.493
It's a little noisy here. Why don't you
take the house phone around the corner.

01:33:25.576 --> 01:33:26.744
Okay. Thank you.

01:33:26.828 --> 01:33:31.791
To a long and prosperous marriage...
of our two companies.

01:33:32.917 --> 01:33:35.378
Excuse me. I'm gonna go make
a phone call. I'll be right back.

01:33:35.461 --> 01:33:36.611
No.

01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:39.924
No.

01:33:39.966 --> 01:33:42.468
- Hello?
- Hey, Lisa. It's me.

01:33:42.552 --> 01:33:43.886
Hey. What happened to you?

01:33:43.970 --> 01:33:46.097
I know. I'm so sorry.
I got stuck at work.

01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:48.599
Look. Daniel's found me
at the hotel.

01:33:48.683 --> 01:33:50.518
Hang on.
Just a minute!

01:33:52.478 --> 01:33:55.148
Look, could I stay at your place
for a couple of days?

01:33:55.231 --> 01:33:57.066
Yeah, of course. Um...

01:33:57.984 --> 01:34:00.361
Go there right now.
I'll... I'll meet you there.

01:34:18.004 --> 01:34:19.154
Hey.

01:34:19.213 --> 01:34:20.363
Hey.

01:34:23.593 --> 01:34:24.677
How are you, Lisa?

01:34:24.761 --> 01:34:27.346
Good. How are you?

01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:28.580
Good.

01:34:30.349 --> 01:34:31.976
Thought you'd be in China by now.

01:34:32.852 --> 01:34:34.771
That makes two of us.
Sit down.

01:34:38.357 --> 01:34:40.485
- What's that?
- It's a present.

01:34:40.568 --> 01:34:42.153
- For me?
- Yeah.

01:34:44.072 --> 01:34:47.492
I saw that yours were...
Yours were broken, so...

01:34:49.118 --> 01:34:50.411
Uh, wanna try them on?

01:34:53.748 --> 01:34:55.833
That's very sweet.
You didn't have to do that.

01:34:55.875 --> 01:34:57.168
Oh, that's okay.

01:35:05.134 --> 01:35:06.302
They're a little big.

01:35:09.389 --> 01:35:11.432
What size shoe do you wear?

01:35:15.645 --> 01:35:16.795
Seven.

01:35:18.564 --> 01:35:20.191
These are 8 1/2.

01:35:27.949 --> 01:35:32.036
I would've told you what size I was if I
knew you were gonna get me some shoes.

01:35:33.121 --> 01:35:34.872
It's okay.
I could exchange them.

01:35:39.752 --> 01:35:41.295
You don't have to do that. I...

01:35:42.046 --> 01:35:45.299
Anyway, I told a friend of mine I'd
meet him for coffee before I left, so...

01:35:46.759 --> 01:35:48.428
What? You're leaving?

01:35:49.554 --> 01:35:50.722
Yeah.

01:35:52.932 --> 01:35:54.082
Bye.

01:36:12.452 --> 01:36:14.996
Hey, Luke. It's me.
Let's meet.

01:36:44.650 --> 01:36:45.985
Jesus Christ.

01:36:46.069 --> 01:36:48.029
What are you doin'?
I thought you were comin' by.

01:36:48.112 --> 01:36:51.449
I, uh... I was comin' by.
I just lost track of the time.

01:36:51.491 --> 01:36:54.160
I got good news for you.
Let's go have a drink.

01:36:54.243 --> 01:36:56.079
I want you to meet someone.
Come on.

01:36:58.289 --> 01:36:59.439
Come on.

01:37:04.921 --> 01:37:08.424
Hey, babe. I came as soon as you called.
Look who I ran into. It's Matthew.

01:37:08.508 --> 01:37:10.510
Matthew, Alex.

01:37:10.593 --> 01:37:12.595
Finally you two meet.

01:37:21.979 --> 01:37:23.231
Hi.

01:37:24.232 --> 01:37:25.382
Hello.

01:37:26.359 --> 01:37:27.527
Have a seat.

01:37:33.616 --> 01:37:34.784
Hi.

01:37:34.867 --> 01:37:36.285
Hello.

01:37:36.369 --> 01:37:37.519
Want a cocktail?

01:37:38.538 --> 01:37:39.688
Excuse me.

01:37:41.332 --> 01:37:42.583
Hi, how can I help you?

01:37:42.667 --> 01:37:43.835
What do you want?

01:37:43.876 --> 01:37:46.796
A vodka rocks. Double.

01:37:47.463 --> 01:37:48.548
Wow.

01:37:48.631 --> 01:37:49.781
Baby?

01:37:50.883 --> 01:37:53.511
You know what? I'll have, um,

01:37:53.553 --> 01:37:56.431
Put it in a bucket. Not like a double,

01:37:56.514 --> 01:37:58.641
He knows how to do it.
Thanks.

01:37:58.725 --> 01:37:59.767
You got it.

01:37:59.851 --> 01:38:01.561
So what happened
with your psycho?

01:38:04.647 --> 01:38:07.817
You can say it in front of Alex.
She knows the whole story anyway.

01:38:12.071 --> 01:38:14.449
Sometimes when you see
someone from afar...

01:38:16.075 --> 01:38:17.744
you develop a fantasy.

01:38:20.913 --> 01:38:22.331
Then when you see them up close,

01:38:22.415 --> 01:38:24.709
nine times out of ten,

01:38:28.921 --> 01:38:32.467
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:38:35.762 --> 01:38:39.182
I was confused,

01:38:40.141 --> 01:38:46.314
thought I'd find what I was looking for,
but I found something else.

01:38:48.107 --> 01:38:49.275
Did you talk to her?

01:38:50.359 --> 01:38:53.279
Just long enough for her
to convince me that she's a liar.

01:38:54.614 --> 01:38:56.199
No harm, no foul, though, right?

01:38:58.534 --> 01:39:01.537
What do you think, Alex?
I mean, you know the whole story.

01:39:04.123 --> 01:39:06.209
It's easy to stand back and judge.

01:39:06.292 --> 01:39:09.003
You don't know anything
about this woman.

01:39:09.754 --> 01:39:13.674
I know that she has no conscience
and no regard for anyone but herself.

01:39:13.758 --> 01:39:15.343
I mean, what else do I need to know?

01:39:15.426 --> 01:39:17.845
You make yourself
into such a victim.

01:39:17.929 --> 01:39:21.015
Nobody made you be with her. You can't
even see what a hypocrite you're being.

01:39:21.099 --> 01:39:22.767
I'm being a hypocrite?
How am I being a hypocrite?

01:39:22.809 --> 01:39:24.685
- Yes, you are!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:39:24.769 --> 01:39:26.104
You guys. Hey, relax.

01:39:26.187 --> 01:39:27.522
No, Luke. Hey, hold on.

01:39:27.605 --> 01:39:30.483
Alex, I'd like you to explain to me
how I'm being a hypocrite.

01:39:34.278 --> 01:39:39.617
Who's to say this woman hasn't been
in love with you for a really long time?

01:39:39.659 --> 01:39:44.247
And now that she found you again,
she wasn't about to let you go twice.

01:39:47.041 --> 01:39:48.126
What?

01:39:48.167 --> 01:39:49.317
Maybe...

01:39:49.377 --> 01:39:51.212
the first time she saw you,

01:39:51.295 --> 01:39:54.465
maybe she felt the way you did
the first time you saw Lisa.

01:39:55.883 --> 01:39:57.135
You remember that.

01:39:58.761 --> 01:40:01.222
Love makes you do crazy things.

01:40:02.056 --> 01:40:03.516
Insane things.

01:40:04.684 --> 01:40:07.687
Things in a million years
you never thought you'd see yourself do.

01:40:10.064 --> 01:40:12.650
There you are doin' it.
Can't help it.

01:40:13.693 --> 01:40:16.821
Jesus Christ.
Lighten up, you guys.

01:40:16.904 --> 01:40:20.074
This woman... she's a nut.
She's psycho.

01:40:20.158 --> 01:40:23.119
She's cuckoo-bananas, all right?
End of story.

01:40:23.202 --> 01:40:25.329
Can we change the subject?

01:40:25.371 --> 01:40:27.457
I actually have something
to cheer you up.

01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:31.461
Did you, uh, leave a note
with the bartender here a few days ago?

01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:34.172
Yeah, I did.

01:40:34.213 --> 01:40:35.548
'Cause Lisa called.

01:40:36.215 --> 01:40:37.383
What?

01:40:37.467 --> 01:40:42.346
Yeah! After you got off the phone.
She said to meet her at 3:00.

01:40:42.388 --> 01:40:46.017
She couldn't wait long, 'cause she had
to get on a plane to London.

01:40:47.435 --> 01:40:49.562
W-where am I
supposed to meet her?

01:40:49.645 --> 01:40:51.689
She didn't say.
She said you'd know.

01:40:52.523 --> 01:40:53.983
You don't know?

01:40:55.318 --> 01:40:57.195
I think you know where.

01:40:57.236 --> 01:40:58.946
It hasn't been that long, has it?

01:40:59.030 --> 01:41:00.198
What?

01:41:01.199 --> 01:41:03.659
You know, uh...

01:41:04.494 --> 01:41:06.204
Maybe he'll know something.

01:41:08.915 --> 01:41:10.750
You knew she was here
the whole time?

01:41:21.094 --> 01:41:23.054
This belongs to you.

01:41:23.096 --> 01:41:24.722
It's from her.

01:41:38.277 --> 01:41:42.865
"Matt. Please don't think
that I'm running away from you.

01:41:42.949 --> 01:41:46.160
"I was so overwhelmed
when you asked me to move in.

01:41:46.244 --> 01:41:48.413
"I couldn't speak.

01:41:48.454 --> 01:41:51.290
"My answer. Of course. Is yes.

01:41:51.374 --> 01:41:54.419
I love you.
And can't wait to come home."

01:41:57.922 --> 01:42:00.258
I'm not going to apologize
for what I've done.

01:42:03.761 --> 01:42:05.722
This is for me to live with now.

01:42:10.727 --> 01:42:12.729
Now you see me for who I am.

01:42:20.903 --> 01:42:22.613
Yes, I do.

01:42:33.833 --> 01:42:35.001
Hey. Where you goin'?

01:42:35.084 --> 01:42:36.252
Hey.

01:42:36.335 --> 01:42:37.795
Where you goin'?

01:42:37.879 --> 01:42:39.380
I know where she is.

01:42:40.214 --> 01:42:41.883
All right.
Tell me what happens.

01:42:43.676 --> 01:42:46.804
That guy. He's um...

01:42:46.888 --> 01:42:49.140
more drama
than a Mexican soap opera.

01:42:49.182 --> 01:42:51.976
Luke! This...

01:42:52.060 --> 01:42:53.227
This is over.

01:42:53.311 --> 01:42:54.771
- What's over?
- Us.

01:42:56.564 --> 01:42:58.566
How can it be over?
We haven't even started yet.

01:42:58.649 --> 01:43:00.318
I'm not who you think I am.

01:43:01.694 --> 01:43:02.987
I used you.

01:43:18.169 --> 01:43:19.319
Taxi!

01:43:20.671 --> 01:43:21.821
Come on.

01:43:35.937 --> 01:43:37.087
Hey!

01:43:38.064 --> 01:43:39.565
Hey, come on!

01:43:40.274 --> 01:43:42.235
God!

01:43:46.239 --> 01:43:47.389
Hey!

01:43:49.409 --> 01:43:51.160
Hey! Hey!

01:43:55.248 --> 01:43:56.416
Sorry.

01:43:56.499 --> 01:43:57.542
Thanks.

01:43:57.625 --> 01:43:59.794
- Goin' to Wicker Park.
- Yeah, right away.

01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:02.857
Your attention. Please.

01:45:02.940 --> 01:45:06.277
Flight 862 service to London
is now boarding.

01:45:33.179 --> 01:45:34.329
Hi!

01:45:35.598 --> 01:45:37.433
There you are!

01:45:37.517 --> 01:45:40.478
Where've you been?
Your flight got in an hour ago.

01:45:40.561 --> 01:45:42.397
I've been down
to luggage claim and back.

01:45:43.731 --> 01:45:45.233
- Rebecca.
- Hey.

01:45:45.316 --> 01:45:46.526
I, um...

01:45:46.609 --> 01:45:48.236
What's the matter?

01:45:48.319 --> 01:45:49.862
Rough flight home?

01:45:49.946 --> 01:45:52.365
Did you bring me back
that little Chinese dress?

01:45:56.202 --> 01:45:57.995
- Rebecca...
- You okay, Sweetie?

01:45:59.747 --> 01:46:01.207
I didn't go to China.

01:46:03.292 --> 01:46:04.669
What are you talking about?

01:46:04.752 --> 01:46:07.839
Hi, Alex. You're never gonna
believe what happened.

01:46:07.922 --> 01:46:09.674
Matthew's back in town.

01:46:11.217 --> 01:46:12.718
I can't marry you.

01:46:13.678 --> 01:46:15.346
It would be a huge mistake.

01:46:15.388 --> 01:46:18.057
You're gonna have to help me out, baby.
Did I do something wrong?

01:46:18.141 --> 01:46:21.018
No, you didn't...
You didn't do anything wrong.

01:46:21.102 --> 01:46:22.252
Rebecca, I...

01:46:23.479 --> 01:46:26.315
I've been doing something wrong
for the last two years.

01:46:27.150 --> 01:46:29.736
I'm not...
I'm not this person.

01:46:29.819 --> 01:46:32.155
I can't go back with you.
I can't do this.

01:46:32.739 --> 01:46:35.241
I was gonna meet him in the park,
but he didn't show up.

01:46:36.284 --> 01:46:38.578
Yeah... I know.

01:46:38.661 --> 01:46:39.996
What do you mean?

01:46:40.079 --> 01:46:45.376
Lisa. I've been doing some really...
horrible and selfish things.

01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:47.211
What are you talking about?

01:46:47.253 --> 01:46:49.380
I've been keeping you apart.

01:46:49.422 --> 01:46:52.633
When we met two years ago,
I was in love with someone else.

01:46:52.717 --> 01:46:55.720
And she just came back
into my life.

01:46:56.471 --> 01:46:59.057
She broke my heart...
And I'm sorry!

01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:00.975
Oh, my God.

01:47:06.773 --> 01:47:09.650
I... Rebecca, I know...

01:47:09.734 --> 01:47:11.569
I know that I'm still in love with her.

01:47:12.361 --> 01:47:14.363
I just... I needed you to know.

01:47:15.156 --> 01:47:16.491
Know what?

01:47:17.617 --> 01:47:19.619
Know what, Matthew?

01:47:20.912 --> 01:47:22.955
That I'm not the girl
that can break your heart?

01:47:23.305 --> 01:47:29.481
