- I want you to bring me my case.

21:05.920 --> 21:08.196
- Sure thing.
- Sir.

21:11.280 --> 21:14.318
Gentlemen, the President
has asked for us.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.193
- By your leave, ma'am.
- Yes, thank you.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.678
Guess it will have to wait.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.398
I guess it will.

21:47.080 --> 21:48.434
(NEIGHING)

21:52.880 --> 21:54.791
Psst. Psst.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.237
If we're going to make a move,
we should do it soon.

22:11.360 --> 22:13.431
Nowhere to run for cover.
Got to wait.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.989
Can't. Can't do it.
I'm done waiting.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.918
Hey. He)'-

22:18.840 --> 22:20.319

22:28.480 --> 22:30.676
Go.

Monroe: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:32.280 --> 22:33.759
Whoa, whoa.

22:34.440 --> 22:35.589
All right.

22:35.720 --> 22:39.270
Well, congratulations,
you made it to Mexico.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.232
Go enjoy the Mexican dream.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.589
Go, go!

22:46.200 --> 22:48.953
Get up!
(NEIGHING)

22:49.120 --> 22:50.713
Monroe: Well...

22:50.840 --> 22:52.638
now we got ourselves a wagon.

(GROANING, STRUGGLING)

23:28.520 --> 23:29.510
What?

23:30.840 --> 23:31.989
That.

23:32.720 --> 23:35.997
You asked for my help.
What did you think I was gonna do?

23:47.880 --> 23:49.359
What the hell?

24:23.040 --> 24:25.873
You brought my kid
down here, Miles?

24:26.040 --> 24:28.634
This is nice. What'd you do,
buy him a handjob and an eight-ball?

24:28.760 --> 24:30.671
Didn't used to be like this.

24:30.800 --> 24:33.235
It's actually pretty nice.

24:50.080 --> 24:52.833
Just tell them we're looking
for Gary and Susan Bennett.

24:54.520 --> 24:56.158
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

25:06.080 --> 25:07.832
What did he say?

25:09.080 --> 25:12.914
Connor's aunt and uncle died.
Eight years ago.

25:13.080 --> 25:14.753
Eight--Eight years...
Mi-Miles?

25:15.480 --> 25:16.470
I didn't know.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.513
When's the last time
you heard from him?

25:19.640 --> 25:20.914
Been a while.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.236
They had a--a kid with them,
Connor Bennett.

25:23.360 --> 25:24.350
Just ask him!

25:32.600 --> 25:34.955
If we don't find him,
or if I find a grave,

25:35.120 --> 25:37.077
with his name on it...

25:37.200 --> 25:39.794
you and I are gonna have
some serious problems.

25:44.360 --> 25:45.680
Sir.

(LIQUID POURING)

26:07.160 --> 26:08.639
Sir?

26:10.960 --> 26:11.950
Are you all right?

26:13.640 --> 26:15.631
Mind your own damn business.

26:29.480 --> 26:31.835
We will never get another chance
like that again.

26:31.960 --> 26:36.511
- You waited too long.
- My boss was staring right at me.

26:36.680 --> 26:38.512
There were factors
beyond my control.

26:38.640 --> 26:39.550
(SCOFFING)

26:39.680 --> 26:42.274
You sound like you're still
an insurance adjuster.

26:43.160 --> 26:46.630
I am not going back to being
some lame housewife, Tom.

26:47.240 --> 26:48.514
I don't care
how you have to do it,

26:48.680 --> 26:50.591
but there is a life
that you promised me.

26:50.720 --> 26:53.997
And I have sacrificed
a hell of a lot to get it.

26:59.400 --> 27:00.515
(GASPING)

27:00.720 --> 27:03.155
(QUIETLY) God help me,
I love you.

27:03.280 --> 27:06.875
And I will give you
everything you want.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.231

His name is Connor Bennett.
You know him?

27:26.880 --> 27:28.518
I said no.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

27:39.880 --> 27:42.440

27:44.320 --> 27:46.880
- I can't help you.
- Uh...

What's with all
the shoulder holsters?

27:54.280 --> 27:57.477
Cartel Nufiez.
Very dangerous.

27:58.960 --> 28:00.598
This town gets better
all the time.

28:00.760 --> 28:03.593
So he's gone. We should get
out of here while we still can.

28:03.760 --> 28:07.390
I'm not going anywhere
without a lead or something.

28:08.880 --> 28:12.111
Look, I said I'd bring you here
and I did.

28:12.280 --> 28:14.112
Now it's time to get back,
deal with the Patriots.

28:14.280 --> 28:17.238
Oh, that's perfect, Miles.
First you kill the kid's mother,

28:17.360 --> 28:20.352
- and then you give up on the kid.
- I didn't kill Emma.

28:20.480 --> 28:22.039
One of your men did.

28:25.280 --> 28:26.793
I'm not leaving without him.

28:34.280 --> 28:36.430
Afternoon, folks.

28:37.120 --> 28:39.634
So, if you don't mind my asking,

28:40.960 --> 28:42.519
what are you doing in town?

28:42.640 --> 28:45.029
Yes, we do mind your asking.

28:45.800 --> 28:47.552
Mind your own damn business.

28:49.920 --> 28:51.638
You're in our town.

28:51.800 --> 28:54.030
- Show a little respect.
- Uh, Bass?

28:54.160 --> 28:57.869
Wow, wow. So this, uh...
this cockfighting ring of hell,

28:58.000 --> 29:01.152
this is all yours?
I'm impressed, really.

29:01.320 --> 29:03.391
Look at this man, huh?

29:03.520 --> 29:06.990
Is this not the whitest Mexican
in Mexico?

29:07.160 --> 29:08.833
- Bass.
- What?

29:10.840 --> 29:12.877
That's him.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.675
Wait a minute.
I know you.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.038
You're Miles, right?

29:22.520 --> 29:23.840
You're Connor?

29:24.640 --> 29:26.039
Who the hell are you?

29:29.880 --> 29:32.076
I'm your dad.

29:42.560 --> 29:44.870
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

29:53.200 --> 29:54.520
My dad's dead.

29:54.640 --> 29:56.313
My mom said he was a mechanic
from East Lansing.

29:56.480 --> 29:58.710
Yeah, well, Emma lied.

29:59.920 --> 30:01.149
It's me.

30:02.880 --> 30:04.598
That's the truth.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.037
Then where is my mom?

30:14.200 --> 30:15.315
She's dead.

30:26.040 --> 30:28.554
Look, I, uh...
I just want to talk.

30:29.720 --> 30:32.633
Good. We'll have a heart to heart.

30:32.760 --> 30:34.717
Maybe I'll make you an ashtray
for Father's Day.

30:34.840 --> 30:37.116
- Does kind of sound like you.
- You shut up.

30:39.720 --> 30:40.710
And you.

30:40.840 --> 30:44.629
You're going to crawl back under
whatever rock you came from.

30:44.760 --> 30:47.434
Or else I'll bury you.

30:50.720 --> 30:52.313
You're gonna bury me?

30:52.440 --> 30:57.640
What, with these West Side Story
pals of yours? Please.

30:58.680 --> 31:00.591
God, you...

31:00.760 --> 31:02.671
You're nothing but a two-bit thug.

31:02.800 --> 31:05.474
Oh, this thug's got 3O men
working for him.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.591
Wow, 30--30 men? Really?

31:07.760 --> 31:10.593
How do you command so many?

31:11.760 --> 31:13.797
This is a dead-end street, kid.

31:13.960 --> 31:16.270
- Trust me, I know.
- Really?

31:16.440 --> 31:18.636
And you know that how?

31:21.240 --> 31:24.358
Because I'm Sebastian Monroe.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.592

31:34.840 --> 31:37.195
You're--You're serious?

You're really Sebastian Monroe?

31:43.960 --> 31:45.917
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

32:10.400 --> 32:12.198
- I got to go back.
- You can't.

32:12.320 --> 32:13.993
Like hell.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.638
You saw him.

32:17.440 --> 32:18.714
You met him.

32:20.280 --> 32:21.793
That's it.

32:23.360 --> 32:26.239
- Time to get back to Texas.
- This is on you, Miles.

32:26.360 --> 32:29.273
You brought an innocent kid
down here.

32:29.400 --> 32:31.311
You dumped him.

32:31.440 --> 32:33.511
Look what he turned into, some...

32:33.720 --> 32:35.836
Some punk with delusions
of grandeur.

32:37.800 --> 32:40.679
Must be like looking in a mirror.

32:42.200 --> 32:43.998
There's nothing
Miles could have done.

32:45.040 --> 32:48.590
Could have watched him,
not watched him.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.358
Put him on Mars.

32:50.480 --> 32:52.630
Put him in a monastery.

32:52.760 --> 32:55.878
It doesn't matter who raised him.

32:56.000 --> 33:00.471
Connor was always gonna
turn out just like this,

33:00.600 --> 33:03.956
because he's your son.
He's your blood.

33:06.920 --> 33:09.560
Well, by that logic, Charlie's
gonna grow up and end the world.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.956
All right, that's enough.
Both of you.

33:14.600 --> 33:16.716
Miles: Come on, Bass.

33:18.680 --> 33:22.230
Being some normal type
of father, that's...

33:24.400 --> 33:25.993
That was never
in the cards for you.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.354
Why don't you just leave it alone?

33:31.920 --> 33:34.560
Okay? You're only gonna
make it worse.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.439

36:14.760 --> 36:15.750
Do we?

36:18.080 --> 36:22.039
I'm not looking for a Hallmark card here.
Just five minutes, all right?

36:25.080 --> 36:27.833
Come on, you must have
some questions.

36:31.320 --> 36:33.038
Yeah, okay.

36:33.160 --> 36:34.434
I got a question for you.

36:36.480 --> 36:38.471
How did my mom die?

36:42.640 --> 36:45.280
She died asking for you.

36:48.680 --> 36:52.355
You know, when Miles came
to drag me down here,

36:52.520 --> 36:56.115
all my mom would tell me was that
it was to keep me safe.

36:58.200 --> 37:00.237
Now I finally get it.

37:00.960 --> 37:04.078
It was to keep me safe from you.

37:06.280 --> 37:09.238
Miles... lied to both of us.

37:11.040 --> 37:12.792
If I knew about you,

37:12.920 --> 37:15.560
I would have come here
in a heartbeat.

37:18.080 --> 37:20.549
- You'd be better off.
- Well...

37:20.680 --> 37:23.354
I don't need your charity.
I'm doing fine.

37:23.480 --> 37:25.869
Right, yeah.
Yeah, with your, uh...

and your what, 30 men'?</i>

37:28.920 --> 37:30.672
Say what you need to say
and get the hell out.

37:30.800 --> 37:32.393
I'm saying it.

37:35.480 --> 37:36.834
You're not...

37:36.960 --> 37:39.474
You're not aiming high enough.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.870
Thirty men?
How about 1,000 men?

37:44.000 --> 37:45.638
Ten thousand men.

37:46.760 --> 37:48.433
What are you talking about?

37:52.520 --> 37:54.830
You are a Monroe.

37:56.240 --> 37:57.719
You should be leading the Republic.

37:57.840 --> 38:00.559
Why do you think I came all
the way down here to find you?

38:00.720 --> 38:01.949
Huh?

38:03.080 --> 38:06.471
It should be passed
from father to son.

38:07.360 --> 38:09.112
Really?

38:09.240 --> 38:10.799
Word's everywhere, pal.

38:10.920 --> 38:13.639
There is no more Monroe Republic.

38:13.760 --> 38:16.559
No. You and me.

38:16.680 --> 38:19.274
Together... we can take it back.

You're my son.

39:02.440 --> 39:03.635
What's going on?

39:03.760 --> 39:05.637
Sir, something's happened
with the Chief of Staff.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.273
The President
needs you immediately.

39:07.400 --> 39:08.674
- At this hour?
- Now, sir.

39:08.800 --> 39:10.757
Is everything all right?

39:10.920 --> 39:13.833
Go back to bed. Let's go.

39:15.840 --> 39:19.151
Just so you know.
Once we get what we want,

39:19.280 --> 39:21.271
I am going to take a knife
and I'm going to gut

39:21.480 --> 39:24.632
that Chief of Staff
husband of yours.

39:39.560 --> 39:41.358
Well?

39:41.520 --> 39:44.273
Connor and some cartel guys
dragged him off.

39:44.960 --> 39:46.109
Let me guess.

39:46.240 --> 39:48.959
We're gonna get ourselves killed
saving Monroe?

39:51.280 --> 39:53.590
Aren't you glad you came?

39:56.560 --> 40:00.349
In the old days, you wouldn't have
looked at an orange twice.

40:00.480 --> 40:03.598
Now it's an unimaginable luxury.

40:03.720 --> 40:05.836
And this is just the beginning.

40:06.880 --> 40:08.712
Oranges from Florida.

40:08.880 --> 40:11.838
Tobacco from North Carolina.

40:11.960 --> 40:14.156
See, we think...

40:14.280 --> 40:17.830
that life should be about
more than just survival.
