00:23.023 --> 00:25.233
-What do you mean?
-I told him he could skip.

00:26.192 --> 00:27.026
Why?

00:28.695 --> 00:30.029
It's a special day.

00:30.572 --> 00:31.990
Yeah, he has a math test.

00:32.615 --> 00:34.284
It's his half-birthday.

00:34.951 --> 00:36.536
[Garett] You got pwned!

00:43.001 --> 00:46.087
I just wish you'd ask me first
before you make any promises.

00:46.171 --> 00:47.964
Can you cut those a little smaller?

00:49.758 --> 00:52.051
No other parents celebrate half-birthdays.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.219
Do I get a present?

00:53.303 --> 00:54.137
-Sure.
-No.

00:56.055 --> 00:57.474

01:15.992 --> 01:16.910
Just take it.

01:21.331 --> 01:22.540
I asked for almond milk.

01:23.124 --> 01:25.335
-They were out.
-So, what is this?

01:26.753 --> 01:27.587
Milk.

01:29.547 --> 01:31.049
I'm lactose intolerant.

01:32.383 --> 01:33.885

Ow.

I need you to do something for me.

02:58.678 --> 02:59.512
Name it.

03:05.852 --> 03:06.853
Share, brother.

03:10.857 --> 03:11.900
[sighs]

03:15.820 --> 03:17.363
I didn't know what else to do.

03:20.617 --> 03:21.993
You could have told me.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.122
They were gonna take Ruby down, too.

03:26.205 --> 03:28.291
I've known you for 30 years.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.524
-Why not?
-[music playing over speakers]

03:53.608 --> 03:57.570
Unless you have one of those super
fancy tubs, it's like you're on a bobsled.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.073
No. We'd be facing each other.

04:00.156 --> 04:03.993
Then we're in a weird rowboat sitch
where everyone's freezing.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.536
[chuckles]

04:05.620 --> 04:08.706
Fine. Okay, um, what about…

04:10.166 --> 04:11.417
the closet?

04:12.418 --> 04:14.045
That's kind of limited.

["Calling All Angels" playing louder]

04:28.768 --> 04:31.229
It's… Train.

04:32.021 --> 04:35.191
Whatever. I know. They're easy to hate on.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.110
-I love everything about them.
-Uh-huh.

04:37.652 --> 04:38.695
[Annie] Which closet?

04:39.445 --> 04:40.280
Broom.

04:40.363 --> 04:41.239
[moans] Hot.

You know, I…

04:50.456 --> 04:52.166
I never thought that I'd…

04:52.250 --> 04:54.377
date someone who loves Train
as much as me.

04:56.337 --> 04:57.213
Are we?

04:57.964 --> 04:58.840
What?

05:00.967 --> 05:02.010
Dating?

05:05.471 --> 05:06.597
Aren't we?

05:07.181 --> 05:09.517
Uh… I mean, uh…

05:10.852 --> 05:11.894
maybe.

05:14.814 --> 05:18.401
[sighs] Um, what do you wanna call it?

05:20.194 --> 05:22.322
Why do we have to call it anything?

05:22.864 --> 05:28.786
Because we've been doing the other it now
for, like, three days straight.

05:28.870 --> 05:31.414
-So, I'm just kind of curious.
-Mmm.

05:37.253 --> 05:38.338
I don't know.

05:39.505 --> 05:40.340
Really?

05:42.717 --> 05:43.718
[grunts]

05:44.844 --> 05:45.845
Come on.

05:45.928 --> 05:49.557
Isn't this something that we could settle
in the broom closet?

05:49.640 --> 05:51.642
Nah. I'm kind of tired.

05:51.726 --> 05:52.852
Hey, come on.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.982
My junk needs to recharge.

But…

06:03.488 --> 06:05.323
the song isn't even done yet.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.744
[Scott] Your supporters are highly loyal,

06:09.827 --> 06:14.248
with 60% being completely
or very certain of their choice.

06:14.332 --> 06:18.002
Hispanic support with some
college to college grad is also solid,

06:18.086 --> 06:19.712
with an overwhelming majority

06:19.796 --> 06:22.632
in strong favor of your
"Clean up the Streets" message.

06:22.715 --> 06:27.512
Polls also show 83% of voters want
a visionary as opposed to a politician.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.305
Uh, is that part good?

06:29.388 --> 06:30.681
Are you a politician?

06:31.474 --> 06:33.810
-[scoffs] No.
-Then it's not bad.

06:33.893 --> 06:37.230
-[chuckles] Okay.
-And women like you in red.

[chuckles] Thank you, Scott.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.069
Seriously?

06:43.736 --> 06:44.904
It's a power color.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.031
I hate red.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.659
-You've got to play by their rules.
-Why?

Because then, we get to do things our way.

Okay.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.039
That's it?

07:38.749 --> 07:40.084
What more did you want?

07:40.168 --> 07:41.169
Need a warrant.

07:41.252 --> 07:42.378
Great, get one.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.256
-Need someone to sign off on that.
-Can you do that?

07:45.339 --> 07:46.799
And you can't do it.

07:46.883 --> 07:49.135
No. Need access to a judge.

07:49.218 --> 07:51.471
-Need my old job back.
-To even get access.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.806
-Our hands are tied.
-We're on vacation.

-What are you gonna do?
-Not us.

07:58.644 --> 07:59.812
How would we get it?

08:00.897 --> 08:02.231
Isn't that what you guys do?

08:03.024 --> 08:08.237
Uh, sorry.
Are you asking us to break the law?

08:08.946 --> 08:10.907
Does that make you uncomfortable?

08:15.077 --> 08:16.329
Consider it a favor.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.373
[Dave] But the clock's ticking

08:19.457 --> 08:23.294
because we used miles for our room
and they're almost gone.

08:23.377 --> 08:24.337
Then we're even.

08:42.104 --> 08:43.189
I can do better.

I love that she needs the whole look
to get into character.

08:47.401 --> 08:50.613
[sighs] Okay, what about dinner Thursday?

08:50.696 --> 08:51.781
[lock jiggling]

08:52.532 --> 08:53.533
Won't it be weird?

Stan loves Deansie.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.285
Not the problem.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.414
-It'll make you guys better.
-Or it'll make us worse.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.875
We'll talk about
their stupid skincare business.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.126
How will that help?

09:04.210 --> 09:07.547
When did we last get boozed up
and it didn't end in a hug fest?

09:07.630 --> 09:11.175
-When did we last get boozed up?
-Exactly.

09:11.259 --> 09:12.468
Time!

09:14.637 --> 09:15.805
It was faster.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.390
You didn't even time it.

09:17.974 --> 09:20.560
How are we gonna even
get into the building?

09:20.643 --> 09:22.728
Why don't we just go during the day?

09:24.689 --> 09:25.773
'Cause he'll be there.

09:25.856 --> 09:27.733
-So, distract him.
-How?

09:28.693 --> 09:30.570
-You know how.
-No, I don't.

09:34.657 --> 09:36.367
Why did Watergate fail?

09:37.410 --> 09:40.037
-Because they got caught.
-Because they were men.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.497
She means use your hoo-ha.

09:42.373 --> 09:44.208
-Just stop.
-Worked with the wire.

09:46.043 --> 09:47.253
You use <i>your</i> hoo-ha.

09:48.170 --> 09:50.798
Just saying, take the brousin
to lunch or something.

09:50.881 --> 09:52.425
You mean "Gang Fairy Godfather"?

09:52.508 --> 09:54.510
-"Brousin" makes more sense.
-Hmm.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.430
-I'm not doing anything with the brousin.
-Why not?

09:58.139 --> 09:59.932
Because then he'll know it's me.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.727
Okay. You guys, we obviously go at night.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.439
What about the security guard?

-[elevator dings]

12:35.421 --> 12:36.505
You've got this.

12:40.384 --> 12:42.928
Come on, ladies, give me a sign.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.283
-Well?
-[sighs]

13:04.366 --> 13:07.203
-I tore my jeans coming out the window.
-No.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.704
Yeah, my favorite pair.

13:09.580 --> 13:10.581
Where we at?

13:17.379 --> 13:19.340
-You guys want in on this?
-What are we gonna do?

13:21.300 --> 13:22.301
[sighs]

13:23.427 --> 13:25.054
10% off at Chili's.

13:26.847 --> 13:28.057
I could do a marg.

13:36.857 --> 13:37.858
Hill, you up?

13:40.402 --> 13:41.278
Nope.

13:42.571 --> 13:44.949
-Guess where I went.
-You smell like a cantina.

13:45.533 --> 13:48.118
-I only had one.
-I didn't ask how many.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.328
Fine, three.

13:50.079 --> 13:51.372
[both chuckle]

13:52.122 --> 13:53.874
All right, where did you go?

13:53.958 --> 13:57.127
When's the last time
you had southwestern egg rolls?

13:57.962 --> 13:59.338
[Stan sighs]

13:59.421 --> 14:01.257
I bought some from Kroger's last week.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.967
No, at Chili's.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.720
[sighs] I don't know, Ruby.

14:08.681 --> 14:12.184
Remember when someone pulled
the fire alarm and we had to go outside?

14:12.268 --> 14:15.062
Yeah, we sat at the wrong booth
when we went back in.

14:15.145 --> 14:19.191
You got halfway through that guy's black
bean burger before you even realized.

14:19.275 --> 14:20.651
[chuckles] We were pretty bombed.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.861
We haven't had fun like that in forever.

14:22.945 --> 14:24.530
[sighs] Need more like it.

14:27.408 --> 14:28.951
How about Thursday?

14:29.535 --> 14:31.412
They still got that Texas Lemonade?

14:31.495 --> 14:33.289
-They do.
-In.

14:35.916 --> 14:37.543
So are the Bolands.

14:42.089 --> 14:43.007
What do you mean?

14:44.508 --> 14:46.218
We all used to have fun together.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.930
Babe, I'm not going to Chili's
with no damn Bolands.

14:51.140 --> 14:51.974
Fine.

14:53.475 --> 14:54.435
Good.

14:55.477 --> 14:56.854
They can come here.

15:00.691 --> 15:01.984
What is wrong with you?

15:02.067 --> 15:03.277
What is wrong with you?

15:03.360 --> 15:04.904
I don't want a situation.

15:04.987 --> 15:06.363
It's just dinner.

15:06.447 --> 15:07.489
It's gonna be weird.

15:08.365 --> 15:10.117
Don't worry. I got you covered.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.119
-How?
-Dean will be there.

15:14.371 --> 15:15.581
[sighs]

15:17.708 --> 15:18.918
[yawns]

15:20.252 --> 15:22.671
Mmm, something smells good.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.215
-What you working on over there?
-Spanish omelet.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.635
-Mmm! Mmm!
-Little chorizo.

15:27.718 --> 15:31.931
Red peppers, fried potatoes,
and a pinch of salt.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.307
Mmm!

15:33.390 --> 15:35.434
Just like we are in Barcelona.

15:35.517 --> 15:36.769
Mmm-hmm.

15:36.852 --> 15:37.811
[Annie] Mmm.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.439
Oh. Whoa, whoa.

15:40.522 --> 15:42.191
-Whoa, sir.
-What?

15:42.274 --> 15:43.609
[cell phone chiming]

15:43.692 --> 15:45.736
Well, where's mine?

15:46.528 --> 15:48.030
Everything you need's on the counter.

15:51.408 --> 15:56.455
Well… it's just that, you know,
you usually make me one.

15:57.873 --> 16:01.085
-Well, that's when we were roomies.
-Well, what are we now?

16:02.878 --> 16:03.963
You tell me.

16:05.381 --> 16:06.674
Oh, come on.

16:07.383 --> 16:10.010
I mean, we're definitely
not dating, right?

16:12.012 --> 16:13.931
We really can't just move past this?

16:14.515 --> 16:15.599
Oh, I have.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.601
[scoffs]

16:17.685 --> 16:18.602
What is that?

16:19.561 --> 16:20.437
Hinge.

16:21.438 --> 16:23.232
Wait, no, this is Tinder.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.901
You're… back on the apps?

16:27.319 --> 16:29.780
How else am I supposed
to put myself out there?

16:29.863 --> 16:31.490
Why do you need to do that?

16:31.573 --> 16:34.910
[sighs] 'Cause you don't
want to do this, right?

16:35.786 --> 16:36.620
I don't…

16:40.207 --> 16:42.835
I don't want to not do this, okay?

16:44.461 --> 16:48.173
And I definitely don't want
you doing this with anyone else.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.136
So, you don't want to date.

16:53.470 --> 16:54.304
Right.

16:55.723 --> 16:58.100
But you don't want to not date.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.351
Right.

17:00.978 --> 17:05.399
Essentially, you want to not not date.

17:07.651 --> 17:08.819
I think so.

17:08.902 --> 17:13.741
But… do you want to
not not date anyone else?

17:15.075 --> 17:15.909
No.

17:16.952 --> 17:18.120
[snickers]

17:20.205 --> 17:21.206
I mean…

17:22.875 --> 17:24.585
Yeah, I'm…

17:25.627 --> 17:26.754
I'm down with that.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.715
-Cool.
-[cell phone chimes]

17:30.549 --> 17:32.509
-You want cheese in yours?
-Duh!

17:32.593 --> 17:33.719
[Kevin chuckles]

17:34.344 --> 17:35.679
-[cell phone chiming]
-[Kevin] Uh…

17:35.763 --> 17:38.265
-You can just turn that off.
-Yeah, I think I will.

17:40.267 --> 17:44.063
Jesus. How did you get
so many matches on this?

17:44.646 --> 17:46.940
-I'm a catch.
-Obviously.

17:48.192 --> 17:51.070
-No, you want to know my secret?
-Yes, please.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.780
Yeah, I just, uh…

17:53.947 --> 17:57.159
I think about the kind of tail
I want to land, right?

17:57.242 --> 18:02.206
And then, I just sort of cater
my profile to the customer.

18:02.289 --> 18:05.167
Sorry. Like, you make stuff up, or…

18:05.250 --> 18:10.297
Uh, I mean, it… It's more like I just
sort of tell them what they want to hear

18:10.380 --> 18:12.007
and then they come to you.

18:12.716 --> 18:15.552
Have I ever volunteered
at an animal shelter?

18:15.636 --> 18:17.096
I mean, no.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.139
But I don't want them gassed either.

18:19.848 --> 18:23.352
Once you figure it out,
it's like shooting fish in a barrel.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.521
And I'm no, like, coder,

18:25.604 --> 18:28.649
but I don't want some algorithm
telling me who I should be with.

18:29.733 --> 18:32.277
Ooh, Oaxacan street corn.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.321
Um, Dad hates that cheese.

18:34.905 --> 18:36.115
She is not wrong.

18:36.865 --> 18:38.325
I'll make coleslaw.

18:38.408 --> 18:40.702
Then, after dinner, you and Stan
can be on the same team.

18:42.454 --> 18:43.455
For what?

18:43.956 --> 18:44.832
<i>Scattergories.</i>

18:46.291 --> 18:48.335
Wait, now we're doing a game night?

18:48.418 --> 18:53.048
-We need to be normal around each other.
-We've never played <i>Scattergories.</i>

18:53.132 --> 18:53.966
<i>Twister?</i>

18:56.135 --> 18:58.178
You guys. I can get us into that office.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.890
We've been using my hoo-ha all wrong.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.314
[chuckling] Hey, Sara. How are you?

19:09.398 --> 19:12.151
It's a little late for you
to be up, isn't it?

19:12.234 --> 19:14.528
Well, my bedtime's
not for another two hours.

19:16.446 --> 19:17.406
Go to your room.

19:25.789 --> 19:26.790
What?

19:28.876 --> 19:32.004
[laughs] I can't believe I finally
met a girl who butt chugs.

19:32.087 --> 19:34.548
Well, how else you gonna
pound a White Claw? [chuckles]

19:34.631 --> 19:36.508
[chuckles] Cheers.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.055
What did you major in at Michigan?

19:42.598 --> 19:44.266
Oh, um, science.

19:44.349 --> 19:46.143
How did you get through organic chem?

19:47.352 --> 19:51.982
I just really love organic stuff.
It's actually pretty easy at Whole Foods.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.611
[both laugh]

19:57.487 --> 19:59.489
[both sigh]

20:01.033 --> 20:02.993
Most girls are turned off by my profile.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.454
You're kidding me. Why?

20:05.537 --> 20:08.040
They get all uptight
about the hating kids stuff.

20:08.832 --> 20:10.250
I mean, kids suck.

20:10.334 --> 20:11.460
-Right?
-Yeah.

20:12.085 --> 20:14.588
Oh, hell, yes. Jell-O shots.

20:16.715 --> 20:18.550
To not remembering anything
tomorrow morning.

20:20.093 --> 20:21.345
I will drink to that.

20:26.350 --> 20:27.392
Mmm.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.314
Ooh!

20:33.398 --> 20:35.359
They go down easier the more you do it.

20:37.569 --> 20:38.528
Oh, uh…

20:39.196 --> 20:41.073
No, I'm just… I'm cold.

20:42.449 --> 20:43.867
Should have brought a jacket.

20:44.451 --> 20:47.204
Wanted you to, uh, have the full picture.

20:48.914 --> 20:49.748
Appreciate it.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.542
Now that you had a preview…

20:54.795 --> 20:56.088
can I borrow yours?

20:56.171 --> 20:57.297
Seriously?

20:57.381 --> 20:59.049

-Fine.

You're sweet.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.766
-My mom always says that.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.810
I bet she's great.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.187
Hmm… [chuckles]

21:13.730 --> 21:14.648
Ready when you are.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.027
Uh, ready for what?

21:19.111 --> 21:20.195
That shot.

21:21.154 --> 21:22.698
Right. Yes. Okay.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.616
Let's just get the waitress.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.619
But then, you'd see me roofie it.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.164
-Will you marry me?

adding a jacket to the uniform.

[Vance] Quite a haul.

26:38.221 --> 26:39.389
He knows everything.

26:41.349 --> 26:46.646
Got to say, none of this looks good
for a lady who's tough on crime.

26:50.317 --> 26:51.234
What do you want?

26:51.818 --> 26:53.486
Let me buy you guys a drink.

26:54.237 --> 26:55.071
Why?

26:55.613 --> 26:57.866
Talk strategy. What's good around here?

27:00.118 --> 27:01.411
There's a Chili's.

27:01.995 --> 27:02.829
Perfect.

27:03.371 --> 27:04.998
Can I throw my bike in the back?

27:05.707 --> 27:07.292
[handle rattling]

27:16.885 --> 27:18.678
Could you take the child lock off?

27:20.764 --> 27:24.017
That doctor dude sounds
way more messed up than you.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.478
-Therapist.
-Textbook.

27:27.020 --> 27:27.979
Mmm…

27:28.563 --> 27:29.439
Textbook what?

27:30.231 --> 27:31.066
Gay.

27:31.149 --> 27:32.525
He's just British.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.652
Your ex-husband? Super gay.

27:34.736 --> 27:36.696
Don't tell me. Noah?

27:36.780 --> 27:38.740
Everyone in law enforcement's gay.

27:39.324 --> 27:42.744
And why is it that I'm listening to you
about any of this again?

27:43.453 --> 27:46.122
Because I'm the only one
who calls it like it is.

27:46.915 --> 27:49.667
But you just have the one call.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.797
[scoffs] Okay. Know who couldn't be
more straight and into you?

27:53.880 --> 27:55.548
Let me guess.

27:58.009 --> 27:59.010
Your hobo friend.

28:00.428 --> 28:03.681
He's experiencing homelessness.

28:03.765 --> 28:05.809
Whatever, that dude's all sac.

28:08.853 --> 28:11.481
I don't think I should be
with anybody right now.

28:11.564 --> 28:12.690
Why is that?

28:14.359 --> 28:17.404
Because I have… [sighs] issues.

28:17.987 --> 28:19.155
Everyone does.

28:19.739 --> 28:21.950
Well, mine could be studied.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.954
Well, at least you're not in denial.

28:26.996 --> 28:27.831
Thanks?

28:28.832 --> 28:32.335
I'm serious. Being aware of it
means you can't be that messed up.

28:36.256 --> 28:38.258
How can a bro like you
be such a good listener?

28:39.759 --> 28:41.219
Not really a bro.

28:41.302 --> 28:43.513
Sorry. Bruh.

28:44.514 --> 28:45.515
[laughing]

28:47.058 --> 28:49.102
-I'm gay.
-That's funny.

28:49.686 --> 28:51.771
Everything on my profile's made up.

28:55.275 --> 28:59.654
But… What about the picture
of you in Jamaica with the cheetah?

28:59.738 --> 29:00.864
Photoshop.

29:00.947 --> 29:03.158
But you had on a backwards hat.

29:03.241 --> 29:04.784
To convince my dad.

29:05.493 --> 29:06.786
[chuckles]

29:07.579 --> 29:08.705
Hmm.

29:08.788 --> 29:10.415
Well, okay, then.

29:11.082 --> 29:12.417
[both chuckle]

29:14.627 --> 29:15.879
[both grunting]

29:15.962 --> 29:17.881
[Annie] Mmm-hmm…

29:19.090 --> 29:21.885
This is one of the best dates
I've ever had with a girl.

29:21.968 --> 29:26.598
And you, my friend,
make very convincing human garbage.

29:27.182 --> 29:29.934
Could I get a selfie for my dad?

29:30.894 --> 29:31.728
Why not?

29:38.568 --> 29:40.695
Um, sorry.

29:41.529 --> 29:42.447
Why?

29:43.239 --> 29:44.741
For what I'm about to do.

29:47.869 --> 29:49.704
[indistinct chatter on TV]

29:54.375 --> 29:56.377
[Dean laughing]

30:00.381 --> 30:01.382
Hey.

30:04.677 --> 30:07.305
Have you seen this bit
where the dude from <i>SNL,</i>

30:07.388 --> 30:09.766
he recaps TV shows?

30:10.558 --> 30:11.392
No.

30:11.476 --> 30:12.936
It's genius.

30:13.019 --> 30:16.397
He tries to guess what the show is
based on the title,

30:16.481 --> 30:18.107
but he has no idea.

30:19.901 --> 30:21.110
How could you?

30:33.998 --> 30:36.292
[Stan] How are
those housewives in the ATL?

30:38.878 --> 30:40.880
[sighs] Didn't watch.

30:40.964 --> 30:42.715
What did you guys do?

30:43.758 --> 30:45.176
We went out for drinks.

30:46.344 --> 30:47.554
Twice in one week?

30:49.722 --> 30:52.308
-Ran into a friend of yours.
-Yeah?

30:58.314 --> 31:00.191
Trying to show off to your bike dads?

31:00.275 --> 31:02.151
-No.
-Must've felt like a big shot.

31:02.235 --> 31:04.362
-It's not like that.
-What's it like, then?

31:04.445 --> 31:06.072
You put me in jail.

31:06.155 --> 31:07.448
Not on purpose.

31:07.532 --> 31:08.741
What's the difference?

31:08.825 --> 31:09.826
You'd still be in there.

31:09.909 --> 31:11.619
He's making sure I don't go back.

31:11.703 --> 31:14.998
-Oh, the grown man in tights.
-He's got my back, okay?

31:15.081 --> 31:16.374
You are such an idiot.

31:16.457 --> 31:18.001
Yeah, for trusting you.

31:18.084 --> 31:19.377
He's not your friend.

31:19.460 --> 31:22.005
-Least he's trying to help.
-To get to me.

31:22.088 --> 31:23.882
What are you talking about?

31:24.549 --> 31:27.886
I have to get the city
to plug his stupid face creams

31:27.969 --> 31:30.597
for, like, conventions
or hotels or whatever.

31:34.767 --> 31:36.227
Wait, he… He said that?

31:37.979 --> 31:39.689
He was never in it for you.

31:43.359 --> 31:45.153
I really did want Nevada.

31:48.823 --> 31:50.491
She could lose everything.

31:50.575 --> 31:51.910
So could we.

31:51.993 --> 31:53.703
She has kids, Stanley.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.332
Who's sleeping down that hall?

31:59.751 --> 32:02.378
Since when do you get to decide
to put a woman away?

32:02.462 --> 32:03.838
It's not just about her.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.715
I don't remember marrying a judge.

32:06.591 --> 32:08.051
You can't even see it anymore.

32:08.134 --> 32:10.053
I can see we're not in a courtroom.

32:10.845 --> 32:13.056
Could dress it up, talk around it.

32:15.141 --> 32:17.060
At least in court, you get a jury.

32:17.143 --> 32:18.728
But we're just criminals now.

32:25.693 --> 32:27.362
You remember our old Nissan?

32:29.864 --> 32:31.741
-Rust bucket?
-Mmm-hmm.

32:32.659 --> 32:35.203
It started out with
a little patch on the door,

32:35.995 --> 32:38.081
but eventually,
it took over the whole car.

32:38.164 --> 32:39.123
Come on.

32:39.207 --> 32:41.292
When's the last time we've been to church?

32:42.835 --> 32:44.504
It bought our daughter a kidney.

32:44.587 --> 32:47.799
-Or volunteered at the food bank?
-It pays for Harry's school.

32:47.882 --> 32:51.719
And the crazy thing…
is that I don't even feel guilty anymore.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.304
Because we deserve it.

33:02.438 --> 33:04.023
Justify it all you want,

33:05.608 --> 33:08.444
but eventually,
it rots out the floorboards.

33:21.165 --> 33:23.876
I guess we should cancel dinner
with the Bolands.

33:25.128 --> 33:26.421
Yeah, probably.

33:28.589 --> 33:30.299
[Nick and Scott laughing]

33:31.426 --> 33:34.721
Dude. Dude, she practically broke my jock.

33:34.804 --> 33:36.305
Sounds like a wild night, buddy.

33:36.389 --> 33:40.351
I was like, "Chill. I know you can't
get enough, but papa's got to sleep."

33:42.228 --> 33:43.646
[laughs]

33:43.730 --> 33:45.273
Hey, where's the file key?

33:46.524 --> 33:47.483
Top right.

33:47.567 --> 33:49.193
Yeah, that's where I left it.

33:49.277 --> 33:50.319
Hmm.

33:51.487 --> 33:52.905
You gonna see her again?

33:52.989 --> 33:54.323
[scoffs] Hell no.

33:55.366 --> 33:57.618
I cannot keep up with your women.

33:59.912 --> 34:01.372
[Scott] Oh, here.

34:04.709 --> 34:05.543
That's weird.

34:05.626 --> 34:07.086
You must have moved it.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.213
I didn't.

34:09.297 --> 34:10.673
It wasn't me.

34:14.510 --> 34:17.346
Can you grab
the night log-ins from security?

34:17.930 --> 34:18.890
Yeah.

[Rio laughing]

34:25.021 --> 34:25.938

34:27.231 --> 34:28.649
Not your boy's girl.

-You think this is funny?
-[laughing]

34:32.153 --> 34:34.072
-What did she get?
-What do you think?

I think you got played, brother.

-Where did you get this?
-It was on my car in the parking lot.

-I like her.
-Why?

She seems like a leader.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.414
I hope she wins.

can pay for her son's private school.
