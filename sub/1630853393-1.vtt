00:50.633 --> 00:51.718
Hello?

02:04.457 --> 02:06.251
-Turn him over.
-Is he alive?

02:08.503 --> 02:09.504
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

02:18.805 --> 02:19.681
Hey.

02:19.764 --> 02:22.142
Hey. Where are you?
I've been calling for an hour.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.185
Lorna, you're not my wife anymore.

02:24.269 --> 02:25.478
<i>Thanks for that, Mick,</i>

02:25.562 --> 02:27.897
I still get confused.
Some days, I think I am your wife.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.732
<i>Others, I'm more like your mother.</i>

02:29.816 --> 02:32.652
Don't do that. Think I can't tell
when you're holding the phone away?

02:32.735 --> 02:35.405
<i>What I am is a person</i>
<i>who runs this practice,</i>

02:35.488 --> 02:36.698
what's left of it anyway,

02:36.781 --> 02:38.825
and as such,
I need to be able to reach you.

02:38.908 --> 02:41.452
Okay, you reached me. What's the problem?

02:41.536 --> 02:43.204
We got a call from Judge Holder.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.832
<i>-She wants to meet with you ASAP.</i>
-The Chief Judge?

02:45.915 --> 02:49.460
Technically, the presiding judge.
Tell me you're not sleeping with her.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.337
No. Why would you even say that?

02:51.421 --> 02:54.966
The only reason you'd be called
to the private chambers of a female judge

02:55.049 --> 02:58.386
<i>is, A, you have a case before her,</i>
<i>or B, you have a personal relationship.</i>

02:58.469 --> 03:00.805
And since
you haven't had any cases for a year…

03:00.889 --> 03:02.724
I never even met the woman.

03:02.807 --> 03:06.102
-She wants to meet with you now.
-But she didn't say what it was about?

03:06.186 --> 03:09.063
No. But can we please
allow for the possibility

03:09.147 --> 03:10.315
this might be positive?

03:10.398 --> 03:12.984
Maybe she wants
to assign you a case pro bono.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.736
-Work begets work.
<i>-Well, maybe.</i>

03:15.987 --> 03:17.071
<i>Mick?</i>

03:17.155 --> 03:18.156
Still here.

03:18.239 --> 03:19.574
<i>Drive one of the Lincolns.</i>

03:19.657 --> 03:20.783
They're in storage.

03:20.867 --> 03:24.037
Get one out of storage.
The Lincoln becomes you.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.914
<i>And you become you.</i>

03:25.997 --> 03:30.418
Should this present as a real opportunity,
you gotta go in there full Mickey Haller.

03:31.044 --> 03:31.920
All right.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.004
Hey!

04:34.524 --> 04:35.441
Hey.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.819
You've got Hayley tonight.
Just calling to remind.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.362
'Cause you think I'll forget?

04:39.445 --> 04:42.824
Six o'clock, okay? Not 6:10. Not 6:05.

04:42.907 --> 04:45.159
Who's the lucky guy? Do I know him?

04:45.243 --> 04:47.203
6:00 p.m. sharp, Mickey.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.288
I got it.

04:48.371 --> 04:50.873
Hey, what can you tell me
about Judge Mary Holder?

04:50.957 --> 04:52.000
Why?

04:52.083 --> 04:54.252
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>She called me to her chambers.</i>

04:54.335 --> 04:56.963
-Did you do something?
<i>-No, I haven't done something.</i>

04:57.046 --> 04:58.715
Then why would she call you to chambers?

04:58.798 --> 05:02.510
I don't know, which is why I'm asking.
What can you tell me about her?

05:02.593 --> 05:05.638
She's got a bug up her ass
the size of the legal canon of ethics,

05:05.722 --> 05:07.473
which makes me think
you've done something.

05:07.557 --> 05:08.850
-Thanks.
<i>-Wait, Mickey--</i>

05:08.933 --> 05:10.018
I'll see you tonight.

05:11.644 --> 05:12.687
He's done something.

05:40.923 --> 05:42.133
Oh, hello, Mick.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.844
-Lorna.
-I was driving this way anyway.

05:44.927 --> 05:47.013
-No. You're checking up.
-Says who?

05:47.096 --> 05:49.265
You look good.
I have always loved this one.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.850
What are you doing here?

05:50.933 --> 05:52.560
This could be a very big deal.

05:52.643 --> 05:55.897
She's the presiding judge.
So I came down to gather intel.

05:55.980 --> 05:56.814
And?

05:56.898 --> 06:00.485
Most of her work is administrative,
which judge goes where and so forth.

06:00.568 --> 06:01.402
And?

06:01.486 --> 06:04.280
And… she assigns cases.

06:05.031 --> 06:08.076
-If that's what this is about…
-You don't want me to blow it.

06:08.159 --> 06:11.621
I'm just saying,
whatever this is, it has to go well. Okay?

06:49.659 --> 06:51.244
Mr. Haller, I presume.

06:52.370 --> 06:53.371
Judge Holder.

06:53.454 --> 06:55.331
I don't believe we've met before.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.457
No, Your Honor.

06:59.168 --> 07:00.670
Well, come on then.

07:05.299 --> 07:07.468
The Lincoln Lawyer,
that what they call you?

07:07.552 --> 07:09.387
Some do, yes.

07:10.638 --> 07:11.848
Or did.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.349
Why?

07:13.433 --> 07:17.270
Mainly worked out of my car.
Going from court to court.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.355
All the driving and so forth.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.066
Being ready
to flee the jurisdiction if need be.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.861
Never fled the jurisdiction.

07:24.944 --> 07:25.945
Have a seat.

07:28.614 --> 07:31.033
What's your relationship
with Jerry Vincent?

07:31.117 --> 07:32.118
Jerry Vincent?

07:33.035 --> 07:37.206
Uh, I used to go up against him
back when he was a prosecutor.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.584
And he switched sides.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.085
He was murdered last night.

07:41.752 --> 07:42.962
Excuse me?

07:43.045 --> 07:44.505
Shot dead in his car.

07:44.589 --> 07:45.423
What?

07:46.048 --> 07:48.468
If you were close,
please accept my condolences,

07:48.551 --> 07:50.178
but that's not why you're here.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.179
Were you close?

07:52.680 --> 07:56.100
I mean, friendly. Colleagues, mostly.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.852
He left you his practice.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.022
I beg your pardon?

08:01.105 --> 08:03.900
Mr. Vincent filed a motion
with the court ten days ago

08:03.983 --> 08:07.987
that allowed for the transfer
of his entire practice to you,

08:08.070 --> 08:10.907
should he become
incapacitated or deceased.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.868
-He never discussed this with you?
-No.

08:13.951 --> 08:18.456
Well, last night he became deceased,
which means what was his is now yours.

08:18.539 --> 08:20.458
Including the Trevor Elliott trial.

08:20.541 --> 08:21.751
You have heard of that?

08:21.834 --> 08:24.462
The tech guy
who killed his wife and her boyfriend.

08:24.545 --> 08:25.505
Allegedly.

08:25.588 --> 08:26.631
Of course.

08:27.798 --> 08:29.175
That's now my case?

08:29.258 --> 08:31.928
They're all your cases, Mr. Haller.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.971
You might not get to keep them.

08:34.055 --> 08:36.766
Every client
has a right to move on to another attorney

08:36.849 --> 08:38.893
once apprised of Mr. Vincent's demise.

08:38.976 --> 08:42.313
What it does mean is you get first shot.

08:42.396 --> 08:45.233
Assuming I'm satisfied
that Mr. Vincent's clients

08:45.316 --> 08:47.777
are being transferred
to a replacement counsel

08:47.860 --> 08:49.987
of good standing and competent skill.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.073
As far as I can tell,

08:52.156 --> 08:55.576
you haven't had
any cases in quite some time.

08:55.660 --> 08:59.622
Yeah. I was in an accident
about 18 months ago.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.333
Surfing, if you can believe it.

09:02.416 --> 09:06.921
I had multiple surgeries
and, well, there were complications.

09:07.004 --> 09:08.172
Complications?

09:09.173 --> 09:14.220
I took painkillers. Got addicted to 'em.
But that's over now. I got help.

09:14.804 --> 09:18.391
Got clean. So whatever concerns
you may have about my reputation, I--

09:18.474 --> 09:22.436
It's my reputation I'm concerned about.
I'm the one that has to sign off on you.

09:23.437 --> 09:24.438
Or not.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.234
Why you?

09:29.193 --> 09:31.028
Of all the lawyers out there.

09:31.612 --> 09:34.240
Honestly, Your Honor, I have no idea.

09:34.323 --> 09:35.741
Well, if you were to guess?

09:35.825 --> 09:37.952
Well, as I said,
Jerry and I were friendly,

09:38.035 --> 09:39.161
we trusted each other.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.372
And second, though this is subjective,

09:41.455 --> 09:44.834
when I am right, there's no better
criminal defense attorney in Los Angeles

09:44.917 --> 09:47.128
and Jerry knew that
from personal experience.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.132
And you think you're right now?

09:51.215 --> 09:52.091
I do.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.099
This is an order

10:00.182 --> 10:02.518
transferring
Mr. Vincent's practice to you.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.021
I can rescind it just as fast.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.982
I will be monitoring you, Mr. Haller.

10:08.065 --> 10:11.694
I want an updated inventory of cases
by the beginning of next week.

10:11.777 --> 10:14.447
After that, a bi-weekly status update

10:14.530 --> 10:17.533
of every case on which
you will remain counsel.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.077
-Am I clear?
-I won't let you down, Your Honor.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.871
Don't let your clients down.

10:21.954 --> 10:25.541
I suggest
you get to Mr. Vincent's office right now.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.209
The police are, no doubt, searching it

10:27.293 --> 10:30.004
and probably
invading their privacy as we speak.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.632
Thank you, Your Honor.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.509
Good luck, Mr. Haller.

10:44.352 --> 10:47.188
Well, did you get a case?

10:48.272 --> 10:49.732
I just got a lot of them.

10:50.441 --> 10:51.942
Including Trevor Elliott.

10:52.026 --> 10:52.860
What?

10:52.943 --> 10:54.070
I need to meet the clients,

10:54.153 --> 10:56.864
get their sign-offs,
but I might be back, Lorna.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.450
I might actually be back.

11:01.535 --> 11:04.080
What did I tell you
about positive visualization?

11:04.163 --> 11:05.915
You wake up, not a single client.

11:05.998 --> 11:09.210
Now, you are repping a guy
like Trevor Elliott in a murder trial.

11:09.293 --> 11:10.628
If he decides to keep me.

11:11.462 --> 11:13.923
Positive thinking, Mickey.
Positive thinking.

11:19.428 --> 11:22.264
-Floor is closed, folks.
-We have business on this floor.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.475
-Not today, you don't.
-Talk to the judge.

11:28.729 --> 11:29.730
Need to see some ID.

11:32.650 --> 11:35.277
You know, you don't
help yourselves being dicky-do's.

11:37.655 --> 11:38.489
Just saying.

11:58.467 --> 12:01.429
-Can I help you?
-Mickey Haller. I'm an attorney.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.472
I've taken over Mr. Vincent's practice.

12:03.556 --> 12:07.143
You need to come back tomorrow.
This is a crime scene. It's sealed off.

12:07.226 --> 12:10.354
The crime scene
was a parking garage, not this office.

12:10.438 --> 12:13.899
There are client files here
I need to access and apparently safeguard.

12:14.483 --> 12:15.693
What'd you say your name was?

12:15.776 --> 12:18.571
Mickey Haller.
This is Lorna Crane. She works with me.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.700
Well, Mickey Haller and Lorna Crane,

12:23.492 --> 12:25.911
I need you to both leave. Now.

12:27.288 --> 12:29.623
-Dicky-do's, I'm telling you.
-What was that?

12:29.707 --> 12:32.418
That wasn't meant for you.
But if you heard me, you heard me.

12:32.501 --> 12:35.087
You're contaminating
a crime scene. You can't be here.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.089
This order
will confirm I've been appointed

12:37.173 --> 12:40.050
by the presiding judge
of the Superior Court

12:40.134 --> 12:42.595
as replacement counsel
to Jerry Vincent's clients.

12:42.678 --> 12:45.014
That means his cases are now my cases,

12:45.097 --> 12:47.558
and you have no right
to be in here looking through files.

12:47.641 --> 12:49.226
That's attorney-client privilege.

12:49.310 --> 12:52.438
Mr. Vincent's been murdered.
The motive could be in one of these files.

12:52.521 --> 12:54.190
-Even if that were the case--
-Counselor--

12:54.273 --> 12:55.816
Just read the order, Detective.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.526
Your crime scene is out in the garage

12:57.610 --> 13:00.654
and no judge in LA would extend it
to this office and these files.

13:03.199 --> 13:06.243
You say this gives you
all of Mr. Vincent's cases?

13:06.327 --> 13:07.578
That's right.

13:07.661 --> 13:10.164
-Then that puts you on our list.
-Come again.

13:10.247 --> 13:11.916
Our suspect list.

13:11.999 --> 13:15.127
He's dead and you get the whole business?

13:15.211 --> 13:17.087
That's motive, ask me.

13:17.171 --> 13:20.591
Care to tell us where you were
last night between 8:00 and midnight?

13:22.551 --> 13:24.470
You got me, Detective. You got me.

13:24.553 --> 13:28.098
I killed Jerry. Case closed, everybody.

13:29.099 --> 13:30.726
Clearly you've done this before.

13:30.810 --> 13:34.188
Are you gonna get out of here,
or do I need to call the judge?

13:38.359 --> 13:39.193
Yeah.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.196
-Guys.
-Nice to meet you, too.

13:42.279 --> 13:43.656
-Bye.
-Let's go.

13:43.739 --> 13:44.990
Leave everything.

13:46.659 --> 13:47.493
What?

13:49.537 --> 13:51.038
All right. Come on.

13:51.121 --> 13:53.833
Sometimes I think
they teach it in the academy,

13:53.916 --> 13:55.251
how to piss people off.

13:55.334 --> 13:58.629
When you think of all the bad blood
between the people and police,

13:58.712 --> 14:02.091
you'd think "how not to piss people off"
would be in the curriculum.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.677
How would you feel about me hiring Cisco?

14:04.760 --> 14:05.803
Ha!

14:05.886 --> 14:06.887
Mickey.

14:06.971 --> 14:09.890
He's a good investigator.
One of the best I've worked with.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.559
Working with your ex-wife is one thing,

14:11.642 --> 14:14.562
hiring her boyfriend
is pushing it, even for you.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.689
If Trevor Elliott decides to keep me,

14:16.772 --> 14:18.148
I'm gonna need to move fast

14:18.232 --> 14:20.442
with an investigator
I can trust, and Cisco--

14:22.611 --> 14:23.737
Yeah, Mickey Haller.

14:25.823 --> 14:29.368
Yes, sir. 2:00 p.m. As in 2:00 p.m. today?

14:29.451 --> 14:31.745
Yes, sir, I'll be there. Thank you.

14:31.829 --> 14:32.913
Who was that?

14:33.831 --> 14:37.751
It's Judge Canter's clerk.
It seems Jerry has a trial today.

14:37.835 --> 14:38.878
-What?
-Yep.

14:39.753 --> 14:43.090
-Are you gonna eat your sandwich?
-No, Lorna, you can have it.

14:43.173 --> 14:44.341
Thank you. Run.

15:00.983 --> 15:01.901
Hey.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.236
-I'm covering for Jerry Vincent.
-Oh, I heard.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.863
Sorry. What's the name?

15:05.946 --> 15:07.364
Haller. Mickey Haller.

15:08.824 --> 15:10.117
And your client's name?

15:10.784 --> 15:11.619
Right.

15:12.369 --> 15:15.414
It's, uh… Letts, first name Izzy.

15:15.497 --> 15:16.582
I think it's a theft.

15:16.665 --> 15:18.042
That would be Marc Daniels,

15:18.125 --> 15:20.878
who I'm covering for,
so that's actually mine.

15:20.961 --> 15:24.256
-Grand theft, by the by.
-Obviously I'm gonna need a continuance.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.300
Obviously I'm not gonna give it to you.

15:26.884 --> 15:29.053
-What?
-I got out-of-town witnesses.

15:29.136 --> 15:31.931
I'd rather they be pissed off
with the judge or you than me,

15:32.014 --> 15:33.682
especially if I wanna get them back.

15:33.766 --> 15:37.269
LA-292587. <i>People vs. Izzy Letts.</i>

15:37.353 --> 15:38.437
And we're on.

15:39.188 --> 15:42.107
Sarah Shepard
for the People, Judge. Ready for trial.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.360
Mickey Haller
for the defendant, Your Honor.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.112
I'll be with you in one second.
May I approach?

15:50.449 --> 15:53.077
Your Honor, Mr. Vincent
unexpectedly passed yesterday.

15:53.160 --> 15:53.994
I'm filing in.

15:54.078 --> 15:56.747
My sincere condolences.
When will you be ready?

15:57.581 --> 15:59.083
-Well…
-Don't be greedy.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.085
It's a bench trial with two witnesses.

16:01.168 --> 16:04.088
Out-of-town witnesses,
who I'll lose with a continuance.

16:04.171 --> 16:05.172
How's tomorrow?

16:05.255 --> 16:06.256
Tomorrow?

16:06.340 --> 16:07.257
Look at the file.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.760
If you feel like
you can't be ready, let me know.

16:09.843 --> 16:10.719
Step back.

16:11.845 --> 16:15.599
This case is continued
until tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.476
-Wait, what?
-Sir?

16:17.559 --> 16:20.062
Your Honor,
we flew down here from San Francisco.

16:20.145 --> 16:22.940
-This is not fair.
-I'm afraid we have an emergency.

16:23.023 --> 16:25.943
What about the victims?
We had an emergency.

16:26.026 --> 16:27.945
My wife was attacked, for God's sake.

16:28.028 --> 16:31.156
She had her necklace
violently snatched off her person.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.201
And the court is sympathetic,
but it's unavoidable.

16:34.284 --> 16:38.247
This case is pushed over
until tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.957
Victims have no rights in this process.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.251
-Yeah. Excuse me.
-That's what she stole?

16:43.210 --> 16:44.837
At least your client has taste.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.925
-Mickey Haller. I'm your attorney.
-Where's Jerry?

16:51.135 --> 16:53.053
Why don't we go someplace we can talk?

16:55.889 --> 16:57.391
He was such a nice man.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.893
He wasn't even charging me.

17:01.061 --> 17:02.271
At least, not yet.

17:04.606 --> 17:06.275
Why would somebody kill him?

17:06.358 --> 17:09.069
I don't know.
The police are still gathering evidence.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.448
What kind of world is this?

17:13.407 --> 17:15.868
I got to be ready
on your case by tomorrow.

17:15.951 --> 17:18.078
-So anything--
-I did not attack her.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.665
I snatched the necklace and ran.
I did not attack her.

17:22.416 --> 17:25.335
Okay. And is there a reason
Jerry didn't try to plead this?

17:25.419 --> 17:28.922
'Cause they wanted two years.
And Jerry said it was excessive.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.925
He thought with a trial,
I could at least impress the judge

17:32.009 --> 17:33.802
with my extenuating circumstances.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.137
Which are?

17:35.220 --> 17:38.682
I'm a good person. Who had a drug problem.

17:38.766 --> 17:40.851
It wasn't me who stole that necklace,

17:40.934 --> 17:43.937
so much as
somebody I don't even recognize.

17:44.021 --> 17:45.189
Somebody who's gone.

17:46.940 --> 17:48.150
I went through rehab.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.277
I'm in recovery.

17:51.278 --> 17:52.279
I believe you.

17:54.615 --> 17:57.451
But I don't know
if that other person's ever really gone.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.288
Mine was oxy.

18:03.123 --> 18:04.041
You?

18:05.542 --> 18:07.252
Same, basically.

18:07.336 --> 18:08.587
Heroin.

18:08.670 --> 18:11.632
Which I switched to
when I couldn't afford the oxy anymore.

18:14.218 --> 18:16.136
So, Jerry planned to put you up there?

18:17.054 --> 18:18.597
Uh-huh.

18:20.224 --> 18:23.185
And introduce
my good personhood status into evidence.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.569
<i>The trial is tomorrow, you say?</i>

18:32.653 --> 18:35.030
Bench trial,
two witnesses. I think I'm good.

18:35.114 --> 18:35.948
Mickey.

18:36.031 --> 18:38.492
<i>Call Marvin Beedleman,</i>
<i>tell him I need a favor.</i>

18:38.575 --> 18:41.703
He's pushing 80,
you might have to remind him he owes me.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.372
<i>Got anything on Trevor Elliott?</i>

18:43.455 --> 18:48.043
Jerry took a retainer of $625,000,
most of which seems to be gone.

18:48.669 --> 18:51.964
He's due another 450 at trial.
Non-refundable.

18:52.047 --> 18:54.800
<i>-Wow.</i>
-I know. It's like a year's worth of DUIs.

18:54.883 --> 18:56.218
<i>It's a franchise case.</i>

18:56.301 --> 18:58.137
-Who's the judge?
<i>-James P. Stanton.</i>

18:58.220 --> 19:01.473
He's an ex-defense attorney,
so that's good. Are you almost there?

19:01.557 --> 19:03.809
-Your appointment's at 3:00.
<i>-I'm pulling up.</i>

19:03.892 --> 19:06.979
Do we know for sure Elliott
hasn't already hired another lawyer?

19:07.062 --> 19:09.857
Don't worry
about any other lawyer. Just go.

19:09.940 --> 19:10.774
All right.

19:13.861 --> 19:14.695
Hey.

19:15.487 --> 19:16.321
Your name?

19:17.573 --> 19:18.991
Haller. Mickey Haller.

19:24.204 --> 19:25.247
Nice car, man.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.165
Thanks.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.960
-Thank you.
-I got it.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.222
Mr. Haller.

19:44.308 --> 19:46.059
Go right up. He's waiting for you.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.688
Sure you don't need anything? Water…

19:49.771 --> 19:50.814
I'm fine. Thank you.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.943
Mr. Elliott's in his office?

19:55.027 --> 19:56.612
His office? No.

20:07.664 --> 20:08.624
Mr. Elliott.

20:09.333 --> 20:10.918
Mickey Haller. How you doing?

20:16.590 --> 20:17.674
Mr. Elliott?

20:17.758 --> 20:19.801
I stand trial
for murder next week.

20:20.677 --> 20:22.638
My attorney's just been shot dead.

20:22.721 --> 20:25.015
You can probably
imagine how I might be doing.

20:27.976 --> 20:29.853
Do they know anything? Any suspects?

20:29.937 --> 20:31.605
Not to my knowledge, no.

20:32.439 --> 20:34.858
I'm told
they wanna interview all of his clients.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.818
Obviously, I wouldn't
advise you talk to them

20:36.902 --> 20:38.362
while this other matter is pending.

20:39.404 --> 20:42.074
What, are they gonna
charge me with killing Jerry too?

20:42.699 --> 20:44.743
Why not? It's open fucking season.

20:47.579 --> 20:49.706
So, who are you?
How come I've never heard of you?

20:49.790 --> 20:50.791
You've never heard of me

20:50.874 --> 20:53.168
because I make it
a practice not to be heard of.

20:53.252 --> 20:56.213
Celebrity lawyers
bring too much attention to their clients.

20:56.296 --> 20:57.339
I don't operate that way.

20:58.757 --> 21:02.928
Now as my case manager explained,
Jerry transferred his practice to me.

21:03.011 --> 21:06.139
If you look at the contract
of representation you signed with him,

21:06.223 --> 21:08.725
you'll see it allowed Jerry
to discuss your case with me.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.769
Did he? Discuss it with you?

21:11.561 --> 21:13.730
No. The point
I'm making, Jerry trusted me.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.232
It doesn't mean I have to.

21:15.899 --> 21:16.775
No, it does not.

21:19.027 --> 21:21.446
-It's Mickey, is it?
-That's right.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.740
You play any basketball, Mickey?

21:24.783 --> 21:26.702
-A little bit.
-I don't.

21:27.577 --> 21:28.620
Not really.

21:30.038 --> 21:31.707
I love to watch though.

21:31.790 --> 21:33.041
But it always drove me crazy

21:33.125 --> 21:36.003
seeing great players
struggle with free throws.

21:36.086 --> 21:40.674
It's the one thing you can control.
Every shot, exactly the same.

21:41.633 --> 21:44.261
Take your time, line it up.

21:47.723 --> 21:51.560
And yet,
time and chance happen to them all.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.813
I don't mean to be an asshole.

21:56.273 --> 21:59.484
Or maybe I do.
We were set to go to trial next week.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.903
I've been waiting
five months to clear my name.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.405
-I understand.
-Do you?

22:03.488 --> 22:06.158
You understand
what it's like for an innocent man

22:06.241 --> 22:09.995
to have to wait and wait
to have his day in court?

22:10.078 --> 22:13.040
To have to read all the lies
and the bullshit in the media,

22:13.123 --> 22:15.876
to have to wear
a fucking ankle bracelet 24/7.

22:15.959 --> 22:19.421
-You understand all of that?
-I've dealt with clients wrongly accused.

22:19.504 --> 22:20.672
Do not handle me.

22:20.756 --> 22:23.508
Okay. I'll get
right to the punchline then.

22:23.592 --> 22:25.594
Jerry Vincent was an excellent attorney.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.472
-I'm better.
-So you say.

22:28.555 --> 22:31.641
-So would say Jerry.
-Maybe. If he were here, which he is not.

22:31.725 --> 22:34.686
-I get your frustration.
-I asked you not to handle me.

22:37.564 --> 22:41.068
Before I consider you,
I need to know you'd be ready next week,

22:41.151 --> 22:42.486
'cause I am not pushing this.

22:42.569 --> 22:45.655
Not for another week.
Not for another fucking day.

22:45.739 --> 22:48.450
-I could be ready.
-You're up to speed on the case?

22:48.533 --> 22:50.535
I will be.
If I'm not prepared, I'll tell you.

22:50.619 --> 22:53.246
But I'm confident
you won't have to delay the trial.

22:53.330 --> 22:56.166
You're confident
you have to tell me that to get the job.

22:57.292 --> 22:58.126
All right.

23:00.253 --> 23:01.671
I need to think about this.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.966
That's a good idea. Have me checked out.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.928
Take your time. Not too much.

23:08.011 --> 23:09.012
The longer you wait,

23:09.096 --> 23:12.682
the greater the chance
the judge will push your trial back.

23:12.766 --> 23:15.727
If you go with me,
I'll make sure that won't happen.

23:15.811 --> 23:18.605
Your sales skills
are admirable, I'll give you that.

23:20.148 --> 23:22.818
Criminal defense
is what I do, Mr. Elliott.

23:22.901 --> 23:25.195
I do it very well. You have my numbers.

23:27.155 --> 23:30.075
I've lost everything,
you understand that, Mickey?

23:31.368 --> 23:34.121
My life, my reputation…

23:36.123 --> 23:37.791
worst of all, my wife.

23:39.584 --> 23:41.586
Who I very much did love.

23:44.172 --> 23:45.090
I get it.

23:45.173 --> 23:47.592
You get nothing. Not yet.

23:48.552 --> 23:53.932
You think you just hit the lottery,
but I'm telling you… not yet.

24:01.314 --> 24:03.733
<i>Next week?</i>
<i>That is impossible.</i>

24:03.817 --> 24:05.652
It was a deal-breaker.

24:05.735 --> 24:07.654
<i>First, let's land him,</i>

24:07.737 --> 24:09.781
then maybe
I can talk him into a continuance.

24:10.782 --> 24:12.242
That has to go.

24:12.325 --> 24:14.077
<i>-What?</i>
-Nothing.

24:14.161 --> 24:15.537
<i>I'm gonna need a driver.</i>

24:15.620 --> 24:17.789
I need this time to be going over files.

24:17.873 --> 24:20.667
<i>I was thinking</i>
<i>maybe Quintero. Is he around?</i>

24:20.750 --> 24:22.711
<i>Still doing time in Corcoran, I heard.</i>

24:22.794 --> 24:24.004
Well, what about Stevie?

24:24.087 --> 24:27.424
Stevie is a terrible driver.
Nobody's getting in the car with him.

24:27.507 --> 24:29.384
All right. Put the word out, will ya?

24:29.468 --> 24:31.553
I'm pulling in. See you in a second.

25:28.610 --> 25:31.821
Jesus. You scared
the shit out of me, Cisco.

25:31.905 --> 25:34.032
What the hell
are you even doing here, man?

25:34.115 --> 25:36.159
Lorna said you wanted to hire me.

25:36.243 --> 25:39.412
Not for this, Cisco.
To work on the Trevor Elliott case.

25:39.496 --> 25:41.665
The police'll handle
who killed Jerry Vincent.

25:41.748 --> 25:43.917
You're giving me a heart attack, man.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.585
You could have given me one.

25:47.921 --> 25:48.838
Sorry.

25:49.548 --> 25:52.509
So, Trevor Elliott, huh? That's a big get.

25:52.592 --> 25:53.760
Yeah, if I get him.

25:54.427 --> 25:56.054
I haven't nailed down the gig.

25:56.137 --> 25:58.348
I need to be able
to tell him something good.

25:58.431 --> 26:00.433
Something to make him wanna hire me.

26:00.517 --> 26:01.685
Have you seen the file?

26:01.768 --> 26:05.939
Some. Two dead people.
He was at the scene. Not exactly stellar.

26:06.022 --> 26:08.191
Yeah, well,
I gotta offer "stellar" somehow.

26:09.025 --> 26:12.445
Maybe Maggie can give us
some inside baseball on the State's case.

26:12.529 --> 26:13.572
Oh, shit. Maggie.

26:19.244 --> 26:20.579
Damn it.

26:20.662 --> 26:23.081
You can go, Mom.
I'll be fine till he gets here.

26:23.164 --> 26:24.541
I'm not going.

26:25.333 --> 26:27.460
Think I'm okay
to be by myself for a half-hour.

26:27.544 --> 26:29.421
The world hasn't gotten that dangerous.

26:29.504 --> 26:32.382
-Not happening.
-I'm hoping to have a nice time tonight.

26:32.465 --> 26:34.467
My chances are better
if Dad's in a good mood,

26:34.551 --> 26:36.261
and the chances of that are better

26:36.344 --> 26:39.431
if you don't rip him a new one
for being 15 minutes late.

26:41.391 --> 26:42.350
There he is.

26:45.061 --> 26:46.938
-I'm sorry.
-Really?

26:49.774 --> 26:51.318
Hi, Dad.

26:51.401 --> 26:52.319
Sorry.

26:53.403 --> 26:54.529
Sorry, Mags.

26:55.488 --> 26:58.617
-You look good. Sorry.
-You gave me your word. 6:00 p.m.

26:58.700 --> 26:59.534
I know.

26:59.618 --> 27:02.329
You really wanna
get back to joint custody? Step one--

27:02.412 --> 27:04.372
Maggie, I'm here now.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.958
How about we deal
with you and me later, all right?

27:08.084 --> 27:10.295
-I'll pick you up in the morning.
-Okay.

27:10.378 --> 27:12.172
-I love you.
-Love you, too.

27:14.549 --> 27:15.383
Hey.

27:16.217 --> 27:18.011
If you're gonna treat me like shit,

27:18.094 --> 27:20.889
have the decency
to not look so amazing while doing it.

27:23.391 --> 27:24.267
Uh-uh.

27:27.771 --> 27:28.730
Hello.

27:29.981 --> 27:32.400
-How are you, baby? You good?
-I'm good.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.569
-Ready? Have your bag?
-Yeah.

27:35.987 --> 27:38.239
He had a sense
what was coming, Jerry.

27:38.323 --> 27:39.282
I don't know.

27:39.366 --> 27:42.535
Well, he files a motion ten days ago.

27:43.203 --> 27:45.330
Transfer his practice
in case of his death.

27:46.206 --> 27:49.709
Look, let's just focus
on Elliott for now, okay?

27:49.793 --> 27:53.171
Mickey's not really serious
about trying this case next week, is he?

27:53.254 --> 27:56.591
Technically, it's nine days.
Okay, I said the same thing,

27:56.675 --> 27:59.094
but cases like this
don't come around often.

27:59.177 --> 28:01.012
And Mickey needs this. He needs something.

28:02.931 --> 28:05.350
He's okay with… You know?

28:07.102 --> 28:08.269
Um…

28:08.353 --> 28:11.940
-I take it you haven't told him.
-I just haven't found the right moment.

28:19.572 --> 28:22.701
So, you didn't
actually go in the water?

28:23.410 --> 28:24.244
No.

28:24.327 --> 28:26.037
You know that nightmare I have?

28:27.122 --> 28:29.499
It's not so much of me almost drowning,

28:29.582 --> 28:31.042
it's of you.

28:31.126 --> 28:34.337
Leaving you behind,
that's the part that always gets me.

28:34.421 --> 28:35.755
-Dad…
-What?

28:35.839 --> 28:37.132
You had an accident.

28:37.215 --> 28:39.384
You're not
the first surfer it's happened to

28:39.467 --> 28:42.929
and I'm not the first kid
to have something bad happen to a parent.

28:43.513 --> 28:46.349
You are tough. You are tough.

28:46.433 --> 28:48.143
Just like your mom.

28:48.226 --> 28:50.520
Don't get quite
as tough as her, okay?

28:50.603 --> 28:52.647
-I'll try not to.
-Well, good.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.816
She's worried about you.

28:54.899 --> 28:56.025
She said that?

28:57.736 --> 29:01.698
She thinks it might be
some mid-life thing on top of the pills.

29:02.699 --> 29:03.616
Is it?

29:05.785 --> 29:07.746
Well, maybe a little.

29:07.829 --> 29:09.330
What do you mean?

29:09.414 --> 29:13.668
<i>Mija,</i> two failed marriages,
busted law practice,

29:14.502 --> 29:16.045
six months in rehab…

29:16.129 --> 29:18.840
You hit the jackpot
with your daughter. Come on…

29:19.424 --> 29:20.717
Hey.

29:22.635 --> 29:26.514
When I look back,
I always wanted to be a defense lawyer,

29:26.598 --> 29:29.142
ever since I was a kid watching my dad.

29:29.225 --> 29:33.772
The stuff they teach you in law school,
how the system's supposed to work.

29:33.855 --> 29:36.816
You get out there and it's all just muddy.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.485
Everybody's working an angle.

29:39.736 --> 29:40.737
Everybody lies.

29:41.988 --> 29:44.824
After a while you wonder
if you're doing any good at all.

29:46.701 --> 29:52.165
You know Mom never feels that way, right?
She just puts bad people away.

29:54.542 --> 29:55.919
Your mom's a true believer.

29:56.002 --> 29:58.379
That's what makes her
so great at what she does.

29:58.922 --> 30:00.131
But you're not?

30:05.720 --> 30:09.432
I was. I think I still am.

30:11.100 --> 30:16.064
Look, I believe that in our system,
everyone is innocent until proven guilty.

30:16.147 --> 30:18.650
Now, when the State
points the finger at you,

30:18.733 --> 30:20.276
well, I'm all you got.

30:22.111 --> 30:23.112
Now what?

30:33.289 --> 30:34.290
Are you kidding me?

30:34.374 --> 30:35.458
Sorry to intrude.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.335
This better be good, Detective.

30:37.418 --> 30:38.378
It's important.

30:43.091 --> 30:46.094
We really gotta see Jerry Vincent's files.

30:47.095 --> 30:49.430
I realize
you have attorney-client privilege.

30:49.514 --> 30:52.141
DA says you probably
have the right to shut us down.

30:57.897 --> 31:00.024
Seriously? I knew this guy.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.443
I really need you
to see what we're up against.

31:07.198 --> 31:10.285
It's a kill shot to the head, very clean.

31:10.368 --> 31:13.288
Whoever pulled the trigger
picked up the shell casings too.

31:13.371 --> 31:15.123
Someone targeted Jerry Vincent

31:15.206 --> 31:18.334
and they didn't
take his wallet or his cash.

31:18.418 --> 31:21.087
They took his bag with his laptop.

31:23.047 --> 31:28.845
Now, the question is, what was on there?
What did he know that got him killed?

31:28.928 --> 31:31.973
If the answer's any place,
it's probably in his files.

31:34.642 --> 31:38.354
I wish I could
help you, Detective, I really do.

31:38.438 --> 31:40.732
I'm asking you to help yourself.

31:42.066 --> 31:43.776
You're at risk, Counselor.

31:45.153 --> 31:46.279
You could be next.

31:54.037 --> 31:57.081
<i>Was Jerry involved</i>
<i>with wise guys or cartel guys?</i>

31:57.165 --> 31:59.167
I doubt it, he was straight ahead.

31:59.250 --> 32:02.045
<i>-Ex-prosecutor.</i>
-Maybe it's someone he put in prison.

32:02.128 --> 32:03.296
One second.

32:06.591 --> 32:09.093
Yeah, I thought about that.
Comb through the files.

32:09.177 --> 32:13.181
Look for any hint of threats,
clients, ex-clients, everybody, all right?

32:13.264 --> 32:14.098
I'm on it.

32:15.016 --> 32:17.226
<i>In the meantime, Elliott gave us access</i>

32:17.310 --> 32:19.520
<i>to his house in Malibu</i>
<i>where the murders happened.</i>

32:19.604 --> 32:21.814
<i>It's important we get a true picture.</i>

32:21.898 --> 32:24.859
I'll shoot you the address.
Let's meet there around noon.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.402
This means we have the case?

32:26.486 --> 32:29.030
Not yet. The more we learn
the better our chances.

32:29.113 --> 32:31.574
-Where are you right now?
-Heading into trial.

32:34.619 --> 32:35.495
Marvin.

32:35.578 --> 32:39.666
-Oh! Mickey!
-Thanks for coming. I appreciate this.

32:39.749 --> 32:40.625
Why wouldn't I?

32:40.708 --> 32:43.878
When the greatest person
I ever met asks for my help,

32:43.962 --> 32:45.004
I give my help.

32:45.088 --> 32:46.214
How's Eleanor?

32:46.297 --> 32:50.969
Oh, she's absolutely fantastic
is how she is. And she sends her love.

32:51.052 --> 32:53.137
Send my love to her. Thank you.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.306
LA-292587. <i>People vs. Izzy Letts.</i>

32:55.390 --> 32:56.808
Be with you in a second.

32:56.891 --> 32:59.268
Mickey Haller, Judge,
asks that we approach?

32:59.352 --> 33:00.812
Please tell me you're ready.

33:00.895 --> 33:02.772
-Almost, Judge.
-Mr. Haller.

33:02.855 --> 33:03.856
Actually, Judge.

33:03.940 --> 33:06.317
At the risk
of further antagonizing Mr. Holt,

33:06.401 --> 33:08.403
maybe we call him up for the sidebar?

33:08.486 --> 33:09.862
-Excuse me?
-What's going on?

33:09.946 --> 33:12.115
A bit unorthodox,
but in the best interests

33:12.198 --> 33:14.033
of judicial economy and justice.

33:14.117 --> 33:15.159
Take 30 seconds.

33:16.452 --> 33:17.829
Mr. Holt.

33:17.912 --> 33:19.706
Could you approach the bench?

33:25.503 --> 33:27.839
How you doin'?
All right, I'll make this quick.

33:27.922 --> 33:29.841
My client is charged with grand theft.

33:29.924 --> 33:32.135
Which under Section 487 of the Penal Code

33:32.218 --> 33:36.305
means the value
of the stolen object exceeds $950.

33:36.389 --> 33:40.059
Your Honor,
that necklace is worth what, $400, tops?

33:40.143 --> 33:41.227
What?

33:41.310 --> 33:43.521
I've taken few payments
in diamonds and gold,

33:43.604 --> 33:45.189
developed a pretty good eye.

33:45.273 --> 33:46.607
But to be sure, Judge,

33:46.691 --> 33:49.027
I also brought with me
an expert on the matter.

33:49.110 --> 33:51.487
That is Marvin Beedleman. He's a jeweler.

33:51.571 --> 33:53.740
He can give us a pretty quick appraisal.

33:53.823 --> 33:56.826
The District Attorney
might want to get one of her own.

33:57.410 --> 33:59.620
Guessing your wife
doesn't know it's a knock-off?

33:59.704 --> 34:01.873
I, of course, don't want to upset her.

34:01.956 --> 34:03.374
Are you kidding me?

34:03.458 --> 34:05.460
I am not. I am not.

34:05.543 --> 34:09.797
Even if it is a knock-off, the defendant
thought she was stealing the real thing.

34:09.881 --> 34:12.216
You have a witness
to testify as to her state of mind?

34:12.300 --> 34:14.886
Did you not have the necklace appraised?

34:14.969 --> 34:17.013
We have the appraisal
from his insurance company.

34:17.096 --> 34:19.265
Might open up a whole new can of fraud.

34:20.683 --> 34:22.018
I could be wrong, of course.

34:22.101 --> 34:26.814
Miss Shepard, any thoughts
on how you might like to play this?

34:32.820 --> 34:35.740
Completely dismissed? I get to just go?

34:35.823 --> 34:38.659
Well, unless the DA
decides to prosecute the Holts

34:38.743 --> 34:41.120
and you get called
as a witness against them,

34:41.204 --> 34:42.538
but I don't think that'll happen.

34:42.622 --> 34:43.456
Oh, my God.

34:43.539 --> 34:45.166
Didn't even have to get up there

34:45.249 --> 34:47.168
and testify
as to what a nice person you are.

34:47.251 --> 34:50.755
I don't know how to thank you.
I will pay you one day, I promise.

34:50.838 --> 34:52.215
You pay me now.

34:53.007 --> 34:54.926
I'm broke.
I don't have a nickel to my name.

34:55.009 --> 34:56.344
Have a driver's license?

34:56.427 --> 34:57.303
Excuse me?

34:58.471 --> 35:00.056
<i>What do you mean you hired her?</i>

35:00.139 --> 35:02.975
I told you I needed a driver,
and she can drive.

35:03.059 --> 35:04.477
I'm actually a good driver.

35:04.560 --> 35:06.979
She's actually a good driver, Lorna.

35:07.063 --> 35:09.649
It wouldn't kill you
to work from an office.

35:09.732 --> 35:12.443
Too much structure.
I gotta work while I'm on the move.

35:12.527 --> 35:16.447
-Didn't you say she's an addict?
-Former. Who am I to judge? Turn right.

35:17.365 --> 35:18.991
I'm almost there. Call you back.

35:19.075 --> 35:20.409
Mickey, no--

35:24.288 --> 35:27.250
-Maggie.
-Hi, Lorna. Nice to see you.

35:27.333 --> 35:31.254
Um, thank you, and likewise.
You look pretty.

35:35.049 --> 35:36.634
Something I can help you with?

35:37.677 --> 35:39.679
We both care for him, Lorna.

35:40.513 --> 35:42.390
And I mean, I'm happy

35:42.473 --> 35:45.184
for all this positive
turn of events for Mickey…

35:45.268 --> 35:46.561
But?

35:46.644 --> 35:50.481
But taking over a high-profile murder
for a lawyer who was just gunned down

35:50.565 --> 35:53.818
for God knows what reason,
do we really think this is a good idea?

35:53.901 --> 35:55.611
The wolf is at the door, Maggie.

35:55.695 --> 35:59.240
I have been holding his practice together
with string and glue.

35:59.323 --> 36:01.909
His life is bigger
than just his law career.

36:01.993 --> 36:05.955
He needs to get back on his feet first.
His daughter needs him back on his feet.

36:06.038 --> 36:09.625
I know, and this could be
the thing that gets him there.

36:09.709 --> 36:12.128
For the first time in a year,
he's alive again.

36:12.211 --> 36:13.296
And you know Mickey.

36:13.379 --> 36:15.464
The only thing he likes more than a fight

36:15.548 --> 36:18.050
is a fight
with one hand tied behind his back.

36:30.563 --> 36:32.148
I'll be about 15 minutes.

36:32.231 --> 36:33.274
Sounds good.

37:04.263 --> 37:05.431
Welcome to the jungle.

37:13.731 --> 37:15.900
Remind me.
We're never bringing the jury here.

37:15.983 --> 37:17.944
They'll hate this guy and we're doomed.

37:26.744 --> 37:29.247
Wife was there on the bed.

37:31.749 --> 37:33.960
Boyfriend there on the floor.

37:35.461 --> 37:39.840
Police think Elliott stood at the door.
Maybe watching them fuck--

37:39.924 --> 37:43.469
Fornicate for a while
before he came in and shot 'em.

37:44.762 --> 37:46.931
Murder weapon was never found.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.642
Probably out there in the ocean.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.274
I don't know, Mick.
You're good, but this good?

37:56.357 --> 37:58.317
If they could place Elliott here.

37:59.110 --> 38:02.238
Motive all over. Positive gunshot residue.

38:03.197 --> 38:04.824
Has he given you his story?

38:08.744 --> 38:11.289
Hey, listen, there's something else.

38:11.372 --> 38:12.206
What?

38:15.084 --> 38:18.045
I know you're okay
with me seeing Lorna and shit.

38:18.129 --> 38:21.132
At least you say you're okay with it.

38:21.215 --> 38:24.010
Lorna's been meaning
to tell you when the time is right,

38:24.093 --> 38:25.594
but somehow,

38:25.678 --> 38:28.681
I suspect the time
might never be right for her,

38:28.764 --> 38:30.182
so I'm just gonna say it.

38:31.559 --> 38:33.144
Me and Lorna,

38:34.937 --> 38:36.188
we're gonna get married.

38:38.024 --> 38:38.983
Ah.

38:41.694 --> 38:45.156
What do you mean, "Ah"?
What is "Ah"? Is it okay with you?

38:45.740 --> 38:47.908
I'm not part of the equation, Cisco.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.994
But I wanna know, is it okay with you?

38:52.288 --> 38:53.122
Do you love her?

38:53.873 --> 38:54.915
With all my heart.

38:56.417 --> 38:57.918
Then it's all right with me.

38:58.002 --> 38:59.628
But I'll tell you, Cisco.

38:59.712 --> 39:02.590
She's one of the four
most important people in my life.

39:03.799 --> 39:06.344
-Should you ever hurt her--
-Of course I would never.

39:06.427 --> 39:08.346
She's the greatest thing ever.

39:08.429 --> 39:09.305
Who's the fourth?

39:09.388 --> 39:10.264
What?

39:11.349 --> 39:12.933
You said four people.

39:14.935 --> 39:17.063
Hayley, Maggie, Lorna and--

39:18.689 --> 39:19.899
Who's the fourth?

39:19.982 --> 39:20.900
Mickey Haller.

39:23.444 --> 39:25.654
Yes, uh… Yes, I'll be there.

39:30.951 --> 39:32.536
Trevor Elliott has summoned me.

39:39.418 --> 39:41.003
<i>You checked out well.</i>

39:41.087 --> 39:44.632
<i>High-performing trial lawyer,</i>
<i>much better than Jerry according to most.</i>

39:44.715 --> 39:47.802
Until you went off the deep end
and became a drug addict.

39:47.885 --> 39:49.136
I'm not an addict now.

39:50.971 --> 39:54.058
Listen, Mickey. The thing about this case,

39:54.141 --> 39:55.810
I need to win it in court

39:55.893 --> 39:58.646
and I need to win
in the court of public opinion.

39:59.438 --> 40:01.482
The world is quick to cancel these days.

40:01.565 --> 40:03.442
Just take a look at my Twitter feed.

40:05.027 --> 40:07.530
I need a lawyer
who can get me my freedom back

40:07.613 --> 40:09.115
and my name back.

40:10.408 --> 40:11.826
Are you that lawyer?

40:13.536 --> 40:14.370
No.

40:16.163 --> 40:18.374
No, all I can do
is get you a "Not guilty."

40:18.457 --> 40:20.626
I can't deliver you a finding of innocent.

40:20.709 --> 40:23.796
The courts don't work that way.
Not guilty, best I can do.

40:23.879 --> 40:26.132
And you can get that? For sure?

40:26.215 --> 40:28.467
Depends on what I have to work with.

40:29.635 --> 40:31.262
-I didn't kill them.
-I didn't ask you.

40:31.345 --> 40:33.848
But I need you to know, I didn't.

40:35.891 --> 40:37.852
All right, here's the deal, Trevor.

40:38.561 --> 40:42.898
I can win almost any case
as long as I know what I'm dealing with.

40:43.691 --> 40:45.359
Right now, I don't.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.485
So you lie to me,

40:47.278 --> 40:50.114
I don't want your case,
however much I might need it.

40:52.658 --> 40:53.492
Okay.

40:56.287 --> 40:57.246
Okay.

40:58.414 --> 41:01.709
I was as far from cool
as you can get in high school.

41:02.418 --> 41:06.380
Girls wouldn't give me the time of day,
but I could always talk to Zelda.

41:07.256 --> 41:08.549
Real life sucked.

41:09.592 --> 41:11.927
But video games, they mattered.

41:12.761 --> 41:14.388
Then I met Lara.

41:14.472 --> 41:17.933
She was different.
She was beautiful, she was brilliant.

41:18.017 --> 41:19.643
And she loved me.

41:21.187 --> 41:24.857
We're just out of grad school,
the game industry was exploding.

41:24.940 --> 41:29.278
But the problem that nobody
could get around was the uncanny valley.

41:29.361 --> 41:30.404
Uncanny what?

41:32.615 --> 41:34.867
If you're trying
to make something humanlike,

41:35.659 --> 41:38.662
the human brain
will reject it unless it's almost perfect.

41:38.746 --> 41:41.248
You know,
video game characters were close to real,

41:41.332 --> 41:42.708
but not close enough.

41:42.791 --> 41:45.628
Especially in the eyes,
the eyes always gave it away.

41:45.711 --> 41:47.880
But the closer the characters resemble us,

41:47.963 --> 41:51.175
the more connection we feel,
the more we wanna play.

41:52.343 --> 41:55.930
That's the uncanny valley.
And I was the one who crossed it.

41:57.973 --> 41:59.600
<i>Working out of my garage.</i>

42:00.309 --> 42:04.146
<i>One script, maybe 100 lines of code,</i>

42:05.314 --> 42:06.315
<i>changed everything.</i>

42:07.358 --> 42:08.943
The girl in the game.

42:12.238 --> 42:13.072
Nocturna.

42:14.823 --> 42:16.700
That was our first big hit.

42:17.785 --> 42:19.203
It's what put us on the map.

42:19.286 --> 42:22.331
And, yes,
I modeled the character after Lara.

42:23.082 --> 42:24.667
It's fair to say that her DNA

42:24.750 --> 42:28.837
is in everything
this company has ever done.

42:29.421 --> 42:30.589
We were a team.

42:31.799 --> 42:33.676
I didn't know she was cheating on me.

42:34.552 --> 42:37.054
Looking back at it,
I was working all the time,

42:37.137 --> 42:40.849
I was traveling too much,
and she grew resentful.

42:42.142 --> 42:43.102
Angry.

42:44.603 --> 42:47.106
I went out to the house
that day to surprise her.

42:49.525 --> 42:50.526
And instead…

42:55.781 --> 42:59.159
I will never get that
out of my head as long as I live.

42:59.243 --> 43:04.373
I found her like that.
My own wife. My best friend.

43:04.957 --> 43:07.001
And that fucking yoga instructor.

43:08.127 --> 43:09.795
And everyone thinks I killed her,

43:09.878 --> 43:12.381
but the truth is
if I had found them alive,

43:12.464 --> 43:14.258
I wouldn't even have left her.

43:16.010 --> 43:19.513
I would have begged her
to come back to me because I need her.

43:20.931 --> 43:25.352
People say I'm a genius.
The code I wrote, they call it magic.

43:26.228 --> 43:29.148
Lara was the magic.
She was the inspiration.

43:29.231 --> 43:32.651
Without her,
I would still be sitting in my garage.

43:34.278 --> 43:37.281
I never could have killed her

43:38.782 --> 43:40.326
because without her…

43:42.703 --> 43:43.829
I have no magic.

43:50.669 --> 43:53.589
That's what you're dealing with.
Can you work with that?

43:55.716 --> 43:57.134
I can win with that.

43:59.637 --> 44:01.805
-You can win with that?
-I can.

44:03.724 --> 44:06.435
-You can win with that next week?
-I can.

44:08.896 --> 44:10.064
Then you're hired.

44:25.079 --> 44:26.705
-<i>Well?</i>
-We got it.

44:26.789 --> 44:29.041
-We got the case?
<i>-Lots of work to do, Lorna.</i>

44:29.124 --> 44:31.710
-We need to keep our heads.
<i>-Oh, my God.</i>

44:31.794 --> 44:34.421
Lots of work.
Tell Cisco to meet me at the office.

44:34.505 --> 44:35.464
Mickey…

44:36.382 --> 44:37.299
See you in a few.

44:54.566 --> 44:55.609
You okay?

44:57.111 --> 44:59.238
Your eyes look like they're about to cry.

45:00.072 --> 45:01.740
Uh, just allergies.

45:01.824 --> 45:03.617
Your eyes
should be on the road, by the way.

45:13.877 --> 45:15.254
You really okay?

45:15.838 --> 45:18.549
Never been better.
Take the turn up here, will you?

45:23.846 --> 45:24.722
Um…

45:24.805 --> 45:26.473
What? Is something wrong?

45:26.557 --> 45:28.892
Yeah, we're being followed.
