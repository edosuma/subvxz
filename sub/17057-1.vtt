<i>Just hang out in space

00:44.254 --> 00:46.674
<i>And no one can fuck with me.</i>

01:33.928 --> 01:36.468

02:56.427 --> 02:59.427
<i>That's why I don't wear

little girl coming down the street.

03:17.740 --> 03:19.030
<i>We do everything together.</i>
Tie that shit up.

03:19.117 --> 03:20.737
Anyway, look, we chillin'

08:26.007 --> 08:28.427
Nah, they don't

How much are they?

Ol' Will-Smith's-son-

10:04.563 --> 10:06.903
Check it out, man. Look

never seen before.

10:12.488 --> 10:14.068
Where'd you get all these at?
Don't worry about that.

10:14.156 --> 10:15.986
Why your shoes look like that?
I got some stuff for you.

10:16.075 --> 10:17.405
My name's Daryl.
What's your name?

10:18.160 --> 10:19.330

10:20.496 --> 10:21.616
Let me show you
some stuff, man.

10:21.706 --> 10:22.786
You might want
some of these stuff.

10:22.873 --> 10:24.923
Your foot game is everything
in this world, man.

10:25.001 --> 10:27.501
Let me show you these.
You seen these?

10:27.586 --> 10:29.086
Brand-new. You feel me?

10:29.171 --> 10:30.971
Those nice.
You like those, huh?

10:31.048 --> 10:34.428
I got something that's gonna
be nice on you, though.

10:34.552 --> 10:38.222
The stores don't even got these, boy.
These exclusive, you see.

10:38.306 --> 10:40.176
But these right here,

10:41.350 --> 10:42.890
these cost more
than your life.

11:36.030 --> 11:38.740
<i>Damn!</i>

11:38.991 --> 11:41.541
Blood, you did not buy these.
Your mama got 'em for you?

11:41.911 --> 11:43.081
I bought 'em.

11:43.162 --> 11:44.292
Nigga, please.

11:44.372 --> 11:45.582
The "Bred"
Air Jordan 1's?

11:45.664 --> 11:46.794
Yeah.

11:46.874 --> 11:48.964
Nigga, are these fucking originals?
Yeah.

11:49.043 --> 11:50.593
Man, they, like, a

11:50.669 --> 11:52.669
How you get them? Hold on, hold
on, hold on. Look, look, look.

11:52.755 --> 11:54.665
I swear to God, I bought 'em.
Like, for real, I did.

11:54.757 --> 11:58.007
Listen, I was walking home when
I saw Crazy Daryl on 23rd.

11:58.094 --> 12:00.554
So, I'm like,
"Yo, Daryl."

12:00.638 --> 12:03.558
<i>And then, he like,
"What up, my nigga?"</i>

12:03.641 --> 12:05.021
So, you know
I'm talking to...

12:05.101 --> 12:06.441
No, he didn't.

12:06.519 --> 12:08.769
Man, anyway... I'm
like, "What you got?"

12:09.105 --> 12:11.685
<i>And then, he, like, "Hey, blood,
check this out right here.</i>

12:11.774 --> 12:13.694
"Nigga, you ain't gon' find
this shit anywhere else.

12:13.776 --> 12:15.436
<i>"This shit cost more
than your whole life."</i>

12:15.528 --> 12:17.528
<i>When I seen them rereleases
looking sweet,</i>

12:17.613 --> 12:18.863
I had to cop 'em.

12:18.948 --> 12:20.618
<i>So I'm, like, "How much?"</i>

12:20.699 --> 12:22.449
<i>This nigga, like, "$200, bro."</i>

12:22.743 --> 12:25.083
<i>So, I turn to walk away knowing
this nigga playing me and shit.</i>

12:25.162 --> 12:27.542
<i>Then he's, like,
"Wait, nah, I meant $150."</i>

12:27.623 --> 12:30.383
- And I'm like, "Yeah, nigga.
- That's more like it!"

12:30.459 --> 12:31.879
<i>And I was, like, "Peace."</i>

12:31.961 --> 12:33.751
That's how I got 'em.

12:40.219 --> 12:42.719
Whatever, nigga. Your dick get

12:42.805 --> 12:44.055
Bro, leave

12:44.140 --> 12:46.560
I'm just saying, man.
Your feet got bigger...

12:46.642 --> 12:48.142
Did your dick
finally get longer?

12:48.310 --> 12:50.770
Why you love
my dick so much, man?

12:51.689 --> 12:52.819
Got 'em.

12:53.566 --> 12:55.646
This li'l nigga

13:25.556 --> 13:27.306
<i>I 'ma tell auntie

13:27.391 --> 13:31.151
Ridin' that bike over there like Mr.

13:31.353 --> 13:34.113
Somebody call
Captain Save-a-ho!

13:34.190 --> 13:36.030
Dumbass lookin' nigga.

13:36.567 --> 13:39.147
I need to get me some of them

13:42.698 --> 13:45.488
Hey, B. Come play

13:45.576 --> 13:47.616
Nah, I don't wanna
fuck up my shoes.

13:47.703 --> 13:51.713
Nigga, they're called Jordans for a reason.
He plays basketball.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.835
Stupid ass.

13:56.795 --> 13:58.005
Who's your friend?

14:00.758 --> 14:01.758
Who?

14:01.842 --> 14:02.932
Fat Albert?

14:03.010 --> 14:05.140
No, not Fat Albert.
Who's that?

14:05.221 --> 14:06.891
Little B?
Yeah.

14:07.598 --> 14:08.598
Hey, Brandon!

14:09.350 --> 14:11.230
Get your ass

14:12.478 --> 14:14.098
Go talk to him.

14:15.523 --> 14:17.233
No, not you.

14:34.583 --> 14:36.093
Where'd you get
your shoes?

14:36.919 --> 14:37.919
This place.

14:38.420 --> 14:39.800
I like them.

14:42.591 --> 14:44.221
Want some?
Yeah.

14:49.431 --> 14:52.691
Um, we're gonna go smoke and
drink in Jamica's garage later,

14:52.768 --> 14:55.398
and probably go see a movie.
You should come.

14:56.939 --> 14:59.859
I don't know.
Probably busy.

15:00.192 --> 15:01.742
"Probably busy"?

15:01.819 --> 15:03.319
What you mean?

15:05.072 --> 15:06.072
Can I have my drink back?

15:06.156 --> 15:07.156
No.

15:07.241 --> 15:08.911
You gotta say you're coming,
and you have to mean it.

15:09.034 --> 15:11.004
All right, well, I'm coming.
You gotta mean it.

15:11.120 --> 15:13.040
I promise. Can I have it back now?
You gotta promise.

15:13.122 --> 15:14.122
I promise.
Okay.

15:18.294 --> 15:19.924
You better come.

15:25.301 --> 15:26.471
You gonna put it
in her booty hole?

15:27.428 --> 15:31.468
Brandon's gonna
get his first blow J!

15:33.267 --> 15:34.347
What?

15:35.352 --> 15:37.692
Hey, you sure you don't wanna come
over and play some video games?

15:37.771 --> 15:39.021
Watch this porn

15:40.107 --> 15:41.317
Nah, I'm straight.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.400
Come on, man.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.194
They fart in each other's
mouths, and they like it.

15:44.278 --> 15:45.988
It's hilarious.
You gotta watch it.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.571
- Bro, I'm cool.
- Oh!

15:48.324 --> 15:49.494
I get it.

15:49.575 --> 15:51.575
Nigga trying to get so
fresh, so clean, clean,

15:51.660 --> 15:53.080
for his first kiss
and shit.

15:53.162 --> 15:54.162
Exactly.

15:54.246 --> 15:55.496
I've kissed
a girl before.

15:57.583 --> 15:59.293
Whatever, man. Look...

15:59.376 --> 16:01.166
If you wanna
shave your balls,

16:01.253 --> 16:02.593
make sure you
get clean strokes.

16:02.671 --> 16:04.421
No side-to-side.
That shit hurts.

Smile. Smile.

19:51.859 --> 19:54.189
Thank you for

<i>- Damn!</i>
<i>- Damn!</i>

23:08.305 --> 23:09.555
Got your ass!

23:09.639 --> 23:11.349

23:12.476 --> 23:14.016
Yo, that sucks.

23:15.228 --> 23:16.308

23:16.396 --> 23:18.436
How we gonna

23:19.691 --> 23:20.781

23:35.791 --> 23:37.461
Yeah, right.
Look at his face.

23:37.793 --> 23:40.753
Nigga probably handed 'em
over like a little bitch.

23:40.837 --> 23:42.377
You know, if I was up in there...
What?

23:42.464 --> 23:44.054
Guess what I would have done?

23:44.132 --> 23:46.052

23:47.469 --> 23:49.679
What's up nigga...
Like, "What up..."

24:00.982 --> 24:04.192
<i>Chin up Chest out
when it's flying time</i>

24:05.153 --> 24:08.743
<i>Can't be a man if I

24:10.450 --> 24:12.540
<i>They crossed the line</i>

24:12.619 --> 24:15.159
<i>So, I'm with it
Don't approach me</i>

24:15.997 --> 24:19.037
<i>Only real gonna survive
And we gonna see</i>

24:26.633 --> 24:27.933
<i>That I ain't no bitch.</i>

24:28.009 --> 24:29.679
You deaf, nigga? You don't

24:30.178 --> 24:31.258
Fuck you, bitch.

24:40.814 --> 24:42.824
Chill out, man. Talking all that shit!

24:42.899 --> 24:45.069
You fucking dumb bitch! You don't

24:45.527 --> 24:47.027
I did know one of 'em!

24:48.029 --> 24:49.279
Flaco!

24:54.995 --> 24:58.205
Shit, man.
Y'all need to chill.

25:00.250 --> 25:04.090
Hey, I ain't fucking with that nigga Flaco.
That nigga's...

26:04.773 --> 26:06.983
<i>Albert's cousin, Trev...</i>

26:09.945 --> 26:10.945
<i>He know everyone.</i>

26:13.698 --> 26:15.198
<i>He set up everybody out here.</i>

26:18.328 --> 26:20.118
Come on in,
little homey.

26:20.205 --> 26:23.115
So, what's up, little bro?
What you want?

26:24.709 --> 26:26.959
I was wondering if you
knew a guy named Flaco.

26:27.045 --> 26:28.125
Know where he at?

26:28.213 --> 26:29.713
Why the fuck would a li'l
nigga like you want to know

26:29.798 --> 26:32.298
where a crazy
nigga like Flaco at?

26:34.970 --> 26:36.010
He took my shoes.

26:40.183 --> 26:42.193
Go get you some
more kicks, little bro.

26:42.519 --> 26:44.599
You ain't getting them back.

26:45.605 --> 26:47.565
What if he jumped you?

26:47.983 --> 26:52.403
Erroneous. I wouldn't be in your
situation in the first place.

26:52.487 --> 26:53.657
LOOK...

26:53.738 --> 26:56.488
Hit Ghost Town a few times,
and you gonna find him...

26:56.574 --> 26:57.914
Bitch, shut the fuck up!

26:57.993 --> 27:00.123
You shut up with
your old rude ass.

27:00.203 --> 27:01.453
The fuck you know
where he at anyway.

27:01.538 --> 27:02.578
Nobody was talking to you.

27:02.664 --> 27:05.254
You should ask your
motherfucking Uncle Marlon.

27:05.333 --> 27:06.333
Don't he stay in Oakland?

27:07.085 --> 27:08.835
He should be
the one helping you.

27:09.421 --> 27:11.511
Y'all family and shit.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.473
Come on, bro. Get up.

27:14.592 --> 27:16.592
Look. Look...
Look, man.

27:16.678 --> 27:18.508
Seriously, little bro,

27:18.596 --> 27:21.726
don't think you can just show
up alone like you did here.

27:21.808 --> 27:23.098
For real.

27:45.206 --> 27:49.286
Hey, girl, I know you got a dollar on you.
Let me get a dollar.

27:49.377 --> 27:50.997
Man, leave
that lady alone.

27:51.087 --> 27:54.047
Dollar, dollar,
dollar bill y'all.

27:54.132 --> 27:55.882
Hey, B, what

27:55.967 --> 27:57.507
Hey, bro,

27:57.594 --> 27:58.764
Shut up.

27:58.887 --> 28:00.927
Damn, man,

28:03.391 --> 28:05.231
This is too small, yo.

28:05.435 --> 28:06.765
Yeah. XL. You know me.

28:07.312 --> 28:09.402
I'm not buying you
no condoms, nigga.

28:09.481 --> 28:11.021
Man, how you know I can't
buy my own condoms?

28:11.107 --> 28:12.187
'Cause you broke.

28:12.275 --> 28:14.065
Man, fuck you. You don't
know my financial business.

28:15.278 --> 28:16.528
Damn, dawg,

28:20.367 --> 28:23.327
So that's how it is? You
just ain't gonna talk to me?

28:23.411 --> 28:25.211
What you think, you gonna get
your shoes back or whatever?

28:25.288 --> 28:26.868
Not just fucking shoes.

28:27.582 --> 28:28.542
They J's.

28:28.625 --> 28:30.455
And you don't fuck
with another nigga's J's!

28:30.543 --> 28:31.753
Shut up!

28:35.340 --> 28:36.510
I would have
had your back.

28:42.597 --> 28:43.967
Damn, nigga,

28:44.057 --> 28:46.937
Yo, where we goin'?

Watch me.

28:50.355 --> 28:52.815
Hey! Hey, yo!

28:53.566 --> 28:56.026
Hey, bitch, where

Nigga, what you mean?

29:11.459 --> 29:12.879
Do something... You want
me to do something, nigga?

29:12.961 --> 29:13.921
It's good.

29:14.003 --> 29:15.133
You ain't gon'

29:20.718 --> 29:21.718
Don't call me

29:22.220 --> 29:24.720
Hey, when you see Flaco,
tell him I'm looking for him.

29:24.806 --> 29:25.806
Come at me, bruh.
I'm not a bitch.

29:25.890 --> 29:27.810
Stop snapping with your fake-ass weave!
Shut up, bitch!

29:27.892 --> 29:28.982

29:30.562 --> 29:32.692
Yo. What the fuck

29:32.772 --> 29:34.402
That punk-ass-bitch

29:34.482 --> 29:38.402
Look, man, we get it. We can get

34:48.129 --> 34:49.549
Who's he?

34:49.630 --> 34:53.050
Is you retarded? I just
said it's your cousin.

34:53.634 --> 34:55.474
Come on, man.
Oh, yeah.

35:07.231 --> 35:08.231
Niggas trying to smoke?

35:09.150 --> 35:10.150
Yeah.

35:10.234 --> 35:13.494
Hey, Ma.
You got a visitor.

35:17.033 --> 35:18.623
Your grandson.

35:19.660 --> 35:22.790
Yeah. Liz's son.

35:22.872 --> 35:25.212
Say hi to your
grandson Brandon.

35:25.291 --> 35:26.791
Hi, Grandma... No, no, no.
No, don't touch her.

35:26.876 --> 35:29.126
She'll flip
the fuck out.

35:30.505 --> 35:32.965
Hey, Ma, that's
your grandson.

35:33.758 --> 35:36.548
You ain't seen him
for a minute, right?

35:39.680 --> 35:41.180
Shit. Wait for it,
wait for it...

35:41.516 --> 35:42.556
They just
let him have it.

35:42.642 --> 35:43.602
Sweet.

35:43.684 --> 35:45.024
Just standing there.
Bro...

35:45.102 --> 35:47.362
Look, look, here it come...
Right here. Look.

35:47.438 --> 35:49.358
Boom!

35:49.440 --> 35:50.530
Shit.

35:50.733 --> 35:52.693
He got Falcon Punched,
nigga.

35:52.777 --> 35:53.897
Goddamn!

35:53.986 --> 35:55.026
I would have had
to pop his ass.

35:55.112 --> 35:56.362
Hell, no!
You're mines, nigga.

35:57.907 --> 36:00.027
So, what you
come here for?

36:02.370 --> 36:05.040
I got into some trouble.

36:05.456 --> 36:07.036
Your mama know?

36:07.875 --> 36:09.415
Mmm-mmm.
She don't know.

36:09.502 --> 36:10.882
What then?

36:12.463 --> 36:14.763
You know
a guy named Flaco?

36:14.841 --> 36:16.471
I heard he live
out here.

36:16.551 --> 36:18.971
And I thought maybe
because of what you do...

36:19.053 --> 36:20.933
Oh, really?
What I do?

36:21.430 --> 36:23.890
No... I just thought,
'cause you know...

36:23.975 --> 36:25.385
You out here,
and he out here,

36:25.518 --> 36:27.308
and you might
know him.

36:27.395 --> 36:28.555
You know what
Flaco mean?

36:30.147 --> 36:32.817
No...
Flaco means "skinny."

36:32.900 --> 36:35.030
He just a skinny,
little nigga like you.

36:35.945 --> 36:37.565
You wanna know
his real name?

36:37.655 --> 36:38.655
Yeah.

36:38.906 --> 36:41.406
I bet you do.

36:42.660 --> 36:45.080
What he do to you?
Take your girl?

36:47.582 --> 36:48.622
Nah.

36:49.292 --> 36:50.462
My shoes.

36:54.338 --> 36:55.338
Oh!

36:56.048 --> 36:58.048
Yeah, I know Flaco.

36:58.634 --> 37:01.104
Fuck that little nigga.

37:02.096 --> 37:04.676
He used to push for me
when he was, like, 13.

37:04.765 --> 37:05.885
Smoked some of
my shit,

37:05.975 --> 37:08.185
and went away
for a few months.

37:08.269 --> 37:09.849
He deserve to
get his ass beat.

37:10.438 --> 37:12.398
So, can you help me?

37:13.107 --> 37:15.567
What? Help you beat
some kid's ass?

37:15.651 --> 37:18.451
I'm a grown-ass man, nephew.
The fuck you thinkin'?

37:22.617 --> 37:24.867
You know why
I went to prison?

37:25.494 --> 37:26.504
Hmm?

37:27.496 --> 37:29.206
I was cooking at the time.
You know what that mean?

37:31.250 --> 37:33.540
Don't do that shit,
it's stupid.

37:33.628 --> 37:35.628
I don't cook no more.

37:36.130 --> 37:39.840
Anyway, I had this
big-ass batch to push.

37:39.926 --> 37:43.096
And this nigga, Neil,
like a brother to me...

37:43.179 --> 37:44.389
Grandma used to put
food on his plate,

37:44.472 --> 37:45.682
we used to share
clothes and shit.

37:47.308 --> 37:48.518
We started cookin',
making stacks.

37:49.977 --> 37:52.767
And this nigga, Neil, decides
he's too good for me,

37:52.855 --> 37:55.315
and he don't
wanna share no more.

37:55.399 --> 37:58.239
Tried snitching on my ass
on some little bullshit,

37:58.319 --> 38:00.399
tried to take
the batch and go solo.

38:00.613 --> 38:02.283
That's why you
went to prison?

38:04.325 --> 38:05.485
Nah.

38:07.411 --> 38:10.831
I found out, and I shot
Neil in his fuckin' face.

38:12.249 --> 38:13.249
Shit is wrong.

38:13.334 --> 38:14.924
You got a problem, you
handle that shit yourself.

38:15.002 --> 38:16.172
Ain't nobody gonna
pull that trigger for me.

38:17.338 --> 38:20.588
You gotta handle your business
yourself, or get the fuck home.

38:20.675 --> 38:22.965
But I just need...
Go on, man.

38:24.428 --> 38:26.058
Get the fuck out.

38:34.021 --> 38:36.231
That...
That bitch is rude, man.

38:36.315 --> 38:38.145
Yo, that was fucked up.

38:38.234 --> 38:39.444
What's up ... What up,
What up, what up?

38:39.860 --> 38:41.030
You looking for pops?

38:41.278 --> 38:42.608
Shit.

38:43.280 --> 38:45.200
Who the fuck is that?

38:45.533 --> 38:48.373
What you doing
rocking them colors, nephew?

38:49.161 --> 38:51.831
Black isn't really a color,
it's more of a neutral...

38:51.914 --> 38:53.334
Man, miss me with
that bullshit, man.

38:53.416 --> 38:54.916
He's nobody.
It's good, blood...

38:55.001 --> 38:56.631
Hey, fuck that shit, man.
It ain't good.

38:56.711 --> 38:58.211
I want to know who
this motherfucker is.

38:58.254 --> 39:00.304
What now? Man, sit
yo happy ass down!

39:00.381 --> 39:01.631
Yo, it's good, blood.

39:01.716 --> 39:03.626
It's good, man. He a nobody, man.
Fuck this shit, man.

39:03.718 --> 39:04.928
I don't know this

39:05.011 --> 39:06.431
Where you from, anyway?

39:06.512 --> 39:07.472
I'm Albert.
I'm just saying...

39:07.555 --> 39:09.015
Motherfucker,

39:11.225 --> 39:12.845
All right,
all right, all right.

39:13.894 --> 39:15.734
I don't give
a fuck about him...

39:15.813 --> 39:16.903
Or this little...

39:16.981 --> 39:18.441
All right,
all right, all right.

39:18.649 --> 39:21.439
You dealin' with
the wrong motherfucker!

40:04.612 --> 40:06.612

40:08.949 --> 40:10.079
I'm the Gorillapino

40:10.159 --> 40:11.199
Hey!

40:11.285 --> 40:12.495

40:12.578 --> 40:15.208

40:18.167 --> 40:21.587
What's your problem? Chill out.
Chill out. Chill out.

40:23.297 --> 40:24.547

40:24.632 --> 40:25.882
Oh, shit. Hey.

40:27.510 --> 40:29.720
Mo, you fucking open fire in
my house in front of my baby

40:29.804 --> 40:31.604
and my goddamn kids,
man?

40:31.680 --> 40:32.770
That little mark

40:32.848 --> 40:35.808
Why don't you shut
the fuck up and sit down.

40:43.234 --> 40:44.694
Where Brandon at?

40:45.736 --> 40:47.236
I'm right here.

40:47.321 --> 40:50.371
I thought I told you to
get the fuck out, man.

40:51.200 --> 40:54.120
Ryan, take these kids

40:54.495 --> 40:55.575
Come on, man.

40:58.582 --> 41:01.502
Yo, I can't believe

41:02.002 --> 41:03.552
Take a picture of my

41:04.380 --> 41:06.590
This nigga's

41:07.424 --> 41:08.764
You get what you
needed from Pops?

41:10.594 --> 41:12.514
Nah, he wouldn't help.

41:12.596 --> 41:14.676
Yo, tell him. Maybe
he know where he at.

41:14.765 --> 41:15.925
Who you lookin' for?

41:16.016 --> 41:18.186
This guy.
He took my shoes.

41:18.269 --> 41:19.269

41:19.353 --> 41:21.023
Now I'm looking for the guy,

Hey, brother,

What's wrong with you?
Whoa, whoa!

56:31.931 --> 56:33.641

56:41.941 --> 56:44.111
What, you got a gun,

56:44.194 --> 56:46.114
Then go into Flaco's
house by yourself.

56:46.196 --> 56:48.066
I ain't dying

56:51.785 --> 56:53.655
Yo, come on.

These are my fucking shoes.

59:17.263 --> 59:18.813
You can't just take
something from somebody

59:18.890 --> 59:20.140

59:21.017 --> 59:22.097

01:00:08.106 --> 01:00:09.106

Get up. Come on.

01:03:05.533 --> 01:03:06.663
Hey! Hey!

01:03:06.742 --> 01:03:07.872
Hey, niggas!

Yo, I got my shoes back.

01:03:12.665 --> 01:03:14.705
Yo, what happened? Are you guys okay?
Look...

01:03:22.758 --> 01:03:25.218
Now we gonna get shot in the
face over your fucking shoes!

01:03:25.303 --> 01:03:26.513
Flaco's gonna kill us!

01:03:32.768 --> 01:03:35.688
Niggas like that don't
give a shit, Brandon!

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:42.650
Let's go, man.

01:05:03.442 --> 01:05:08.202
<i>Chin checking full of respect
Gotta move as a threat</i>

01:05:09.782 --> 01:05:12.542
<i>Daily be stressed
Round my way</i>

01:05:12.618 --> 01:05:14.618
<i>I'm off the project steps</i>

01:05:16.247 --> 01:05:21.787
<i>To the curb side at 13
I been cravin' cream</i>

01:05:22.545 --> 01:05:27.715
<i>A gatekeeper Them who

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:29.510
<i>Of blood flow</i>

01:05:31.178 --> 01:05:34.138
<i>The girls love me
'cause I love dough</i>

01:05:35.474 --> 01:05:39.814
<i>Keep the haze in my veins
and the dope burns slow</i>

01:05:40.396 --> 01:05:42.266
<i>With my sidekicks</i>

01:05:42.356 --> 01:05:45.316
<i>All of us on that fly shit</i>

01:05:46.068 --> 01:05:49.778
<i>Ain't lettin' nothin' stop
I ride for my kicks</i>

01:06:23.689 --> 01:06:26.689
You ever been in trouble
with the cops before?

01:06:29.153 --> 01:06:30.363
Figured.

01:06:31.322 --> 01:06:32.622
You always been
too much of a pussy

01:06:32.698 --> 01:06:34.778
to get in trouble
with the cops.

01:06:50.716 --> 01:06:53.426
That ain't
how that works.

01:06:55.179 --> 01:06:57.719
You such a man now.
Go on, be a man.

01:06:59.308 --> 01:07:00.848
You wanna walk around
with a piece strapped,

01:07:00.935 --> 01:07:03.225
starting shit
you can't finish?

01:07:04.021 --> 01:07:06.321
That ain't how
that works, bro.

01:07:08.234 --> 01:07:10.284
That nigga that
beat you is dead.

01:07:11.278 --> 01:07:13.608
He got tossed
in front of a car.

01:07:18.744 --> 01:07:20.624
And now Gabe got shot.

01:07:21.706 --> 01:07:24.666
Over some shit you
started over some shoes.

01:07:35.052 --> 01:07:36.972
How you get
your shoes back?

01:07:38.013 --> 01:07:39.393
Flaco house.

01:07:41.892 --> 01:07:43.852
Oh, snap.

01:07:43.936 --> 01:07:45.476
Look at your big,
swingin' dick.

01:07:47.064 --> 01:07:48.734
Maybe I was wrong
about you.

01:07:48.816 --> 01:07:51.186
You gon' be all right
after all, shit.

01:07:52.236 --> 01:07:53.316
You think so?

01:07:53.404 --> 01:07:55.784
No, you probably
still gonna die.

01:07:56.449 --> 01:07:57.949
At least you let
him know where you at.

01:08:00.369 --> 01:08:01.829
Let me see 'em.

01:08:04.790 --> 01:08:06.130
Yeah, boy.

01:08:07.168 --> 01:08:09.418
Had me a pair just like
those back in the day.

01:08:14.884 --> 01:08:16.304
Go home now.

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.640
For real this time.

01:08:28.731 --> 01:08:30.270
Wait.

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:33.490
You gon' need
that, bro.

01:10:02.908 --> 01:10:04.658
You like those, J?

01:10:23.596 --> 01:10:26.346
That's my boy.
Come on, J. Hold my hand.

01:10:44.325 --> 01:10:46.075
Where we going now?

01:10:46.535 --> 01:10:48.155
To get your shoes back.

01:10:48.287 --> 01:10:49.787
But we just got some
shoes, and I like 'em.

01:10:49.872 --> 01:10:51.252
That's not the point.

01:10:51.332 --> 01:10:52.372
Just 'cause you
small don't mean

01:10:52.458 --> 01:10:55.918
you let other niggas
fuck with you. Right?

01:10:57.463 --> 01:10:58.633
Right?

01:10:59.465 --> 01:11:01.715
You remember that kid you

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:03.550

01:11:05.137 --> 01:11:08.517
Now it's your turn to show
him who the fuckin' man is.

01:11:08.599 --> 01:11:11.099
A'ight? You could
do that, J?

01:11:11.185 --> 01:11:12.385
Yeah.

01:11:12.603 --> 01:11:13.853
A'ight.

01:11:15.856 --> 01:11:19.686
Don't worry, J.
I'm gonna help you.

01:11:48.806 --> 01:11:49.846
Hey.

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:55.940
Can I play?

01:11:57.439 --> 01:12:00.029
You're not worried
about your shoes?

01:12:03.862 --> 01:12:06.572
I'm working on my
left right now, so...

01:12:10.953 --> 01:12:13.163
I bought you guys
some stuff.

01:12:13.372 --> 01:12:14.792
Bring any snacks?

01:12:14.873 --> 01:12:15.923
No.

01:12:17.042 --> 01:12:19.382
I got you some
protections.

01:12:21.213 --> 01:12:23.053
Let me
see them shits.

01:12:25.718 --> 01:12:29.008
Yeah. See, these are
the right size.

01:12:29.096 --> 01:12:30.756
'Cause you know,
my dick is huge as fuck,

01:12:31.056 --> 01:12:35.056
so like the other kinds cut off
circulation around my balls and shit.

01:12:35.144 --> 01:12:38.654
You're not supposed to wear
the condom around your balls.

01:12:38.731 --> 01:12:40.611
Shut up. You don't
have big dick problems.

01:12:51.368 --> 01:12:53.408
You know this don't
change shit, right?

01:13:00.711 --> 01:13:02.921
You don't got
nothing to say?

01:13:10.637 --> 01:13:12.137
Yo, Rico,
we gonna play?

01:13:12.222 --> 01:13:13.602
Nah, nigga,
I don't feel like it.

01:13:25.986 --> 01:13:29.196
<i>Stupid, get stupid,
get stupid</i>

01:13:29.948 --> 01:13:33.868
<i>Go stupid, go stupid,
go stupid</i>

01:13:33.952 --> 01:13:35.952
<i>Come on,
go stupid with me</i>

01:13:37.164 --> 01:13:38.964
Where you
learn that song?

01:13:39.333 --> 01:13:40.633
From you.

01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:17.870
Hey.

01:14:18.622 --> 01:14:20.622
You ever
Spider-Man a ho?

01:14:20.999 --> 01:14:22.129
What?

01:14:22.918 --> 01:14:25.708
Come on, nigga.
Spider-Man.

01:14:25.796 --> 01:14:27.126
Okay, so you're
with a bitch, right...

01:14:27.214 --> 01:14:28.924
You ain't never
with no bitches.

01:14:29.007 --> 01:14:30.837
Let me tell
my story.

01:14:31.176 --> 01:14:34.466
After you in the booty hole,
you know, from behind.

01:14:34.555 --> 01:14:35.595
- All right.
- Yeah.

01:14:35.681 --> 01:14:38.021
Anyway, so you
about to bust, right?

01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:41.520
Right before you pull out,
you spit on her back,

01:14:41.603 --> 01:14:43.443
so she thinks
you busted.

01:14:43.522 --> 01:14:45.112
But you really
busted in your hand.

01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:47.690
And when the bitch
turns around...

01:14:48.443 --> 01:14:49.863
What, nigga?

01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:52.870
What, man?

01:15:01.874 --> 01:15:03.084
Fuck!

01:15:12.759 --> 01:15:14.049
Come on, J!

01:15:15.262 --> 01:15:16.432
Hurry up!

01:15:22.561 --> 01:15:23.851
Shit! Shit!

01:15:23.937 --> 01:15:25.057
Go, go, go, go!

01:15:26.106 --> 01:15:27.356
Come on!

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:29.400
Hustle!

01:15:32.988 --> 01:15:33.988
He's right behind you!

01:15:34.072 --> 01:15:35.452
I saw him.

01:15:43.916 --> 01:15:46.246
<i>Even when I dream...</i>

01:15:49.922 --> 01:15:52.092
<i>I dream about getting chased.</i>

01:16:01.016 --> 01:16:05.766
<i>Sometimes I wish
I had a spaceship.</i>

01:16:11.735 --> 01:16:14.735
<i>Just hang out in space
where it's quiet.</i>

01:16:20.202 --> 01:16:22.412
<i>And no one can fuck with me.</i>

01:16:31.546 --> 01:16:32.706
Fuck you, bitch!

01:16:32.839 --> 01:16:34.839
Get up, nigga!
Bring that shit!

01:16:35.634 --> 01:16:38.054
I dare you, nigga!
Do something else!

01:16:38.136 --> 01:16:39.136
Get up!

01:16:39.221 --> 01:16:40.221
Do something!

01:16:49.690 --> 01:16:51.320
Get back down.

01:16:54.528 --> 01:16:57.568
I dare you, nigga.
Do something else!

01:16:57.823 --> 01:16:58.823
I dare you.

01:17:52.544 --> 01:17:55.014
Boy, give me
that gun, Jeremiah.

01:17:56.340 --> 01:17:58.380
Give me the gun,
Jeremiah.

01:17:59.134 --> 01:18:00.184
J!

01:18:11.688 --> 01:18:12.858
Hey, bruh.
