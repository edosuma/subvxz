WEBVTT

00:36.453 --> 00:38.246
Hank, are you doing the dishes?

00:38.329 --> 00:40.707
Nope. Just watching things float.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.292
It's time for this year's

00:42.375 --> 00:43.585
Arlen Homemade Boat Regatta.

00:43.668 --> 00:45.712
I was just doing a little brainstorming.

00:45.795 --> 00:48.506
All right! The regatta's coming up?

00:48.590 --> 00:50.967
I love watching those crazy boats!

00:51.051 --> 00:54.179
It's like the river's filled
with giant bath toys!

00:54.262 --> 00:56.973
-Well, we set the bar
pretty high last year.

00:57.057 --> 01:00.560
How do you top a Cowboys helmet? Huh.

01:00.643 --> 01:04.522
I wonder if I could make Tom Landry's head
from two-by-fours.

01:04.606 --> 01:08.818
Hey. This says the regatta's
for contestants 13 and older.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.988
Yeah.
The Arlen River's not as tame as it looks.

01:12.072 --> 01:15.658
-No. I meant I'm 13.
I know.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.828
So why don't you and I
enter a boat together?

01:19.454 --> 01:20.455


01:20.538 --> 01:23.958
You? You'd want to build a boat with me?

01:24.417 --> 01:27.921


01:28.004 --> 01:29.589
Regatta, regatta, regatta!

01:29.672 --> 01:32.175
I don't know if it's more fun to do
or say!

01:32.258 --> 01:33.468
I can feel it!

01:33.551 --> 01:35.929
This is the year we crush the competition

01:36.012 --> 01:39.390
and take home the gold... colored trophy.

01:39.474 --> 01:40.975
Guys, I've got great news!

01:41.059 --> 01:43.770
Bobby and I
are gonna enter a boat this year.

01:43.853 --> 01:45.063
-That's great!
Well, good for Bobby!

01:45.146 --> 01:49.067
Wow. You'll really have your hands full,
Hank, building two boats.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.778
Well, no. It's just gonna be the one boat.

01:53.530 --> 01:54.405
With Bobby.

01:54.948 --> 01:58.076
But... but regatta!

01:58.159 --> 02:01.663
You are now our sworn enemy. Leave us!

02:01.746 --> 02:02.580


02:02.664 --> 02:07.460
I can't believe I have to explain this.
My son wants to build a boat.

02:07.544 --> 02:08.711
Away with you!

02:13.967 --> 02:15.385
Turn back, Hank.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.471
Turn back.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.016
Turn back!

02:27.897 --> 02:30.525
When did young girls
start dressing like tramps?

02:30.817 --> 02:33.236
Mm-hm. They call them prosti-tots.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.447
A bargain bin. This is perfect.

02:36.531 --> 02:38.658
While Hank and Bobby are boatbuilding,

02:38.741 --> 02:42.203
I can rediscover my love
of classic used literature.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.830
And I can catch up on those books,

02:43.913 --> 02:47.917
with the long-haired Hercules
in the ripped shirt.

02:48.001 --> 02:51.504
<i>Ocean of Passion</i>, 50 cents.

02:51.588 --> 02:54.549
-Sold!
-Wait a second.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.843
Is that an "ology"?

02:58.344 --> 03:02.390
Oh, yeah! Sociology One-oh-one!
Wait, there's more!

03:06.186 --> 03:10.273
Anthropology, Psychology, Chemistrolog...

03:10.356 --> 03:12.192
Oh, no, Chemistry.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.821
Bobby, there's something
I've been wanting to give you

03:16.905 --> 03:18.323
for a long time.

03:18.406 --> 03:21.951
But I was saving it
for our first father/son project.

03:23.286 --> 03:26.915
Look at this hammer. It's so tiny.

03:26.998 --> 03:31.169
Yeah, I kind of thought this day
would come a few years earlier.

03:31.252 --> 03:33.671
Are we gonna fill those jugs
with diet soda

03:33.755 --> 03:36.633
and Mentos to create a super rocket boost?

03:36.716 --> 03:38.551
No. We won't be doing that.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.846
We're gonna take those bottles
and brace them together for a slick,

03:41.930 --> 03:44.557
-unsinkable foundation.
-Oh...

03:44.641 --> 03:48.186
Well, I guess you got this part
under control.

03:48.269 --> 03:51.231
How about I be
the crepe paper-and-feathers guy

03:51.314 --> 03:53.691
and you take care of everything else?

03:53.775 --> 03:55.860
Bobby, this is a team boat.

03:55.944 --> 03:58.821
That means we work together
every step of the way.

03:58.905 --> 04:02.200
Every step? Even the boring ones?

04:02.283 --> 04:05.620
-Especially the boring ones.
-Okay.

04:07.580 --> 04:10.625
I just need you to catch the wood
as it comes off the saw.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.964
You know, what I'm excited about is...

04:16.172 --> 04:17.048
What?

04:17.131 --> 04:21.010
I was saying how our boat's gonna be
the best one in the regatta!

04:21.094 --> 04:23.012
Who picks the winners?
Is that a panel? Or--

04:23.096 --> 04:26.516
We have to build the boat first.
Let's concentrate on that.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.352
Hey, I can barely see through my goggles.

04:29.435 --> 04:31.229
Dangit. What now?

04:31.312 --> 04:35.858
I was just wondering how come my goggles
are fogging up and yours aren't?

04:35.942 --> 04:38.069
Is my breath moister than yours?

04:38.778 --> 04:39.779
I tell you what...

04:39.862 --> 04:43.574
Why don't you stand over there
while I cut this piece?

04:43.658 --> 04:44.534
Can do.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.257
How's it going out there?

04:59.340 --> 05:00.925
Bobby's not doing anything.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.218
He's just talking.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.388
Maybe I'll send him to the store
for glitter and puffy paint

05:05.471 --> 05:07.307
while I build this thing myself.

05:07.390 --> 05:10.476
Hank, this always happens when you work
with Bobby on something.

05:10.560 --> 05:14.230
You have what psychology textbook writers
refer to as...

05:14.314 --> 05:16.190
"a controlling personality."

05:16.274 --> 05:19.610
You try to work as a team
but end up doing everything yourself.

05:19.694 --> 05:22.488
That's because Bobby doesn't know
how to do anything.

05:22.613 --> 05:25.867
Hank, you have to let Bobby learn
from his own mistakes.

05:25.950 --> 05:28.619
Will he lose a finger? Maybe.

05:28.703 --> 05:32.165
But he will gain a finger of knowledge
in his brain.

05:36.377 --> 05:40.757
Okay. We need to fasten these
into secure rows to support our base.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.842
And we'll use a...

05:44.510 --> 05:46.220
Well, what do you think we should use?

05:46.304 --> 05:47.764
How about rubber bands?

05:47.847 --> 05:52.769
The big kind Wile E. Coyote uses
to slingshot himself at the Roadrunner.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.104
Okay.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.939
We're gonna try metal

05:57.023 --> 05:58.316
bracing rods secured with glue.

05:58.399 --> 05:59.984
You think you can handle some gluing?

06:00.068 --> 06:05.239
Ten years of macaroni-artwork experience
says, "Yes, I can."

06:10.536 --> 06:11.913
Ah, dangit.

06:11.996 --> 06:15.416
I think I left my clamps
inside when I was aligning the condiments

06:15.500 --> 06:18.002
in your mother's spice rack. Hang on.

06:21.714 --> 06:22.590
What the...

06:26.094 --> 06:28.471
Dad, help! Something's out here!

06:35.603 --> 06:37.605
Help! I'm losing my grip!

06:41.734 --> 06:46.114
Dad, I can't do this by myself!
We're supposed to be a team!

06:50.284 --> 06:52.662
Dad! The door won't open!

06:52.745 --> 06:54.122
Dad!

07:02.588 --> 07:06.259
-So, Dad, what happened back there?
-There was a bat.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.428
Oh, yeah. I saw.

07:08.511 --> 07:12.014
I meant what happened with you?
I needed your help.

07:12.098 --> 07:16.185
And when I ran for the door,
it felt like you were holding it shut.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.645
Bobby, please.

07:17.728 --> 07:20.314
Your father would never leave you
alone with a bat.

07:21.107 --> 07:24.026
Hank, why did you leave Bobby alone
with a bat?

07:24.110 --> 07:26.779
I didn't. The door was jammed.

07:26.863 --> 07:31.576
And I had to guard the house
because bats always fly into women's hair.

07:31.659 --> 07:34.287
You've seen the movies.
That's why I held the door shut.

07:34.370 --> 07:36.706
But you just said the door was jammed.

07:38.207 --> 07:39.250
I know that!

07:40.668 --> 07:43.796
Dad? Are you afraid of bats?

07:43.880 --> 07:46.007
What? That's crazy!

07:46.090 --> 07:49.177
I'd rather not get rabies
if that's what you're asking.

07:49.260 --> 07:52.054
Wait. You are scared of bats!

07:52.138 --> 07:56.476
Wow. Dad, I didn't think anything
could scare you.

07:56.559 --> 08:00.313
Look, I... Bats are disgusting, okay?

08:00.396 --> 08:03.316
Disgusting and evil. Everyone knows that.

08:03.399 --> 08:07.028
Well, evil creature or not,
the regatta's a week away.

08:07.111 --> 08:10.490
And we got a boat to finish.
Are you ready, Dad?

08:12.325 --> 08:13.659
I'll be right there.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.457
Halt! Enemy approaching!

08:20.082 --> 08:23.044
Hah! Resorted to spying, have we?

08:23.127 --> 08:25.046
I don't care what you're doing, Dale.

08:25.129 --> 08:27.715
I just need your help getting rid of a...

08:27.798 --> 08:28.841
a bat.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.426
A bat?

08:30.510 --> 08:33.888
Why, certainly.
Let me just finish up here.

08:34.430 --> 08:35.348
Thanks.

08:35.431 --> 08:37.266
I need to get back in to help Bobby.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.520
But I can't go near that garage
with that thing in there.

08:40.603 --> 08:44.982
By the way we chose a theme
for our boat that you may enjoy.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.150
What do you think?

08:46.317 --> 08:48.069
Ah-sha-sha-sha!

08:49.153 --> 08:52.323
-That's a boat?
-Not just "a" boat.

08:52.615 --> 08:53.866
Sha-sha!

08:53.950 --> 08:56.786
Behold! The Dracula Five Thousand!

08:56.869 --> 08:58.829
The Transylvania Express!

08:58.913 --> 09:00.831
Get that thing away from me!

09:00.915 --> 09:03.125
Your secret is out. Bobby told Joseph.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.002
Joseph told Nancy. And Nancy told me.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.712
And I told everybody!

09:09.131 --> 09:12.009
You don't stand a chance
against our bat boat, Hank!

09:12.093 --> 09:14.720
As for your bat problem, my answer is...

09:17.181 --> 09:19.934
That's bat for "Get lost, traitor."

09:24.021 --> 09:26.566
You don't like bats? Well, neither do I.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.109
That's why I'm calling you.

09:28.609 --> 09:31.070
I don't know what kind of bat it is.

09:31.153 --> 09:33.364
No, I will not look at its belly.

09:33.447 --> 09:34.740
Come on, Dad.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.158
We're behind schedule!

09:36.242 --> 09:37.451
Ah, the hell with it!

09:41.539 --> 09:43.583
You can do this. Nothing to fear.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.921
Problem Hank?

09:49.005 --> 09:51.674
Peggy, you... you startled me.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.802
You are suffering from a textbook case
of phobia.

09:54.885 --> 09:58.014
-No, that's not true. I just...
-Hank, I fixed Bobby.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.640
Let me fix you too.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.978
You know, I've always loved that clock.

10:04.061 --> 10:06.272
Especially the pendulum.

10:06.939 --> 10:09.859
Look at the pendulum, Hank.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.322
Let's watch as it swings, shall we?

10:14.405 --> 10:16.115
Back and forth.

10:16.198 --> 10:17.950
Back and forth.

10:18.701 --> 10:19.702
Tell me, Hank.

10:19.785 --> 10:22.663
Did you resent your mother
when she stopped breastfeeding you?

10:22.747 --> 10:25.124
-What?
-Dad, you can take your time.

10:25.207 --> 10:26.125
I'm getting out there.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.918
I started up on my own.

10:28.002 --> 10:30.921
I connected the base
and got going on a platform.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.298
Bobby, that's great.

10:32.381 --> 10:35.843
You finished step B,
then you moved on to step C.

10:35.926 --> 10:39.847
Yeah. Now if you'll excuse me,
I don't want to lose this momentum.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.100
Bobby's got momentum.

10:44.894 --> 10:49.023
How's the boat coming, Hank?
You know, the one you're "not" building?

10:49.106 --> 10:51.150
Bobby's taking care of the boat.

10:51.233 --> 10:53.402
I guess all those years
of watching me work...

10:53.486 --> 10:57.698
-has finally sunk in.
-Wow. Bobby is a workmachine.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.118
Bobby, Bobby, what are you doing?

11:01.202 --> 11:05.623
I noticed that your maintenance work
on the house has been lacking lately.

11:05.706 --> 11:08.542
So I figured I'd take a quick look
at the gutters.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.587
-The gutters are fine.
-Yup.

11:11.671 --> 11:15.883
There's your gutter goop right there...
just like I figured.

11:15.966 --> 11:18.636
Well, I wanted to check the gutters
the other day.

11:18.719 --> 11:21.514
But the ladder was in the garage. So...

11:22.098 --> 11:25.935
How about you make yourself useful
and throw that away for me?

11:27.395 --> 11:28.562
Amazing.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.357
Bobby has taken over as man of the house.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.818
You've been demoted to Bobby of the house.

11:33.901 --> 11:36.153
At this rate,
it won't be long until he's...

11:36.237 --> 11:38.280
mowing your lawn.

11:43.619 --> 11:45.538
Is that the power drill?

11:45.621 --> 11:47.623
My plans don't call for a power drill.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.125
It's not just a tool.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.127
It's an electric metaphor.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.254
Bobby is empowered.

11:53.337 --> 11:55.506
And he's drilling the point home.

11:55.589 --> 11:58.718
Building a boat is a big job
and he needs my help.

11:58.801 --> 12:01.137
Besides Bobby shouldn't feel
good about himself

12:01.220 --> 12:03.931
just because I have a... a flaw.

12:04.014 --> 12:06.559
It is an important step
in development, Hank,

12:06.642 --> 12:11.772
for a child to see a parent as human,
with weaknesses and vulnerabilities.

12:12.314 --> 12:14.275
I'm glad it was you and not me.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.572
Did you cap off those PVC pipes?

12:19.655 --> 12:21.574
Yes, Dad!

12:21.657 --> 12:23.033
And you made sure they were level?

12:23.117 --> 12:25.661
Why don't you just come in here and see?

12:25.745 --> 12:29.790
-Frank sleeps during the day.
-Frank? You named the bat?

12:29.874 --> 12:31.792
We're practically roommates.

12:48.642 --> 12:51.645
-So, where were we?
-See?

12:51.729 --> 12:55.816
If you spackle brown paint on PVC pipe,
you got bamboo.

12:55.900 --> 12:59.236
-And to me, that just cries out tiki hut.
-Wait.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.655
You moved on to design work already?

13:01.739 --> 13:03.532
You haven't even sealed your flashings.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.659
Yeah, yeah. I'll get to it eventually.

13:05.743 --> 13:09.497
For now, I got tiki on the brain
so I'm gonna roll with that.

13:09.580 --> 13:12.917
You can't just skip basic steps.
There were blueprints.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.210
Oh, and FYI,

13:14.293 --> 13:16.921
I think I'm gonna remodel this place.

13:17.421 --> 13:21.634
-Make it less garage-y, more Bobby.
-What?

13:21.717 --> 13:25.137
I have never cared for the layout
of this thing.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.598
No! Not my pegboard!

13:27.681 --> 13:28.974
My hacksaw!

13:29.517 --> 13:30.726
The crescent wrench!

13:32.311 --> 13:34.104
My needle-nose pliers!

13:38.025 --> 13:40.194
Guys, I need your help getting over

13:40.277 --> 13:41.695
my fear of bats.

13:42.321 --> 13:46.826
I haven't been in my garage all week.
I'm not even contributing to the boat.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.911
Well, then you're not really even
on a team!

13:48.994 --> 13:50.621
All right! We win!

13:50.704 --> 13:52.456
Okay, fine. You win.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.124
I just need to help Bobby.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.709
He's not listening to me anymore.

13:55.793 --> 13:59.338
And I just know his boat is gonna sink
as soon as it hits the water.

13:59.421 --> 14:02.424
Fine. If you want to kick
this phobia square in the pants,

14:02.508 --> 14:05.511
there's only one friend you need... Liddy.

14:05.594 --> 14:07.972
-Liddy?
-Comma G. Gordon.

14:08.055 --> 14:11.600
Nixon's former "everything man"
is a master of self-discipline

14:11.684 --> 14:14.937
who knew that to conquer a fear,
one must engage it.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.021
Okay.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.274
As a teen, Liddy feared rats.

14:18.357 --> 14:21.110
Until he stalked, killed, and ate one.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.362
I am not eating a bat, Dale.

14:23.445 --> 14:25.990
That is unfortunate.
I think we all would have enjoyed that.

14:28.409 --> 14:29.827
What else did Liddy try?

14:29.910 --> 14:31.954
Hmm. To overcome a fear of lightning,

14:32.037 --> 14:34.623
he tied himself to a tree in the middle
of a thunderstorm.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.458
Tied himself to a tree, huh?

14:36.542 --> 14:37.459
Hm.

14:38.460 --> 14:39.753
Let's make Hank eat a bat!

14:43.591 --> 14:44.925
Welcome to Bat Bridge,

14:45.009 --> 14:48.971
home to 20,000
of Arlen's thirstiest neck nibblers.

14:49.096 --> 14:49.972
Uh...

14:50.055 --> 14:53.017
I'm sorry, did you say "thousand?"

14:53.100 --> 14:55.227
We've been through a lot together, Hank.

14:55.311 --> 14:57.479
Somehow I always knew
it would come to this.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.607
The bats come out at sunset.

14:59.690 --> 15:03.235
Soon the wing-ed, fang-ed swarm
will emerge from under that bridge...

15:03.319 --> 15:06.280
to feast on these gnats
that will encircle your head.

15:06.405 --> 15:07.281
Uh...

15:07.364 --> 15:09.617
You know, just thinking about
what I'm gonna do

15:09.700 --> 15:14.204
has actually gotten me over my fear.
Yup. Pretty clever, Dale.

15:14.288 --> 15:15.748
Come on, let's go grab a beer.

15:16.832 --> 15:18.918
My dad's designs were good.

15:19.001 --> 15:22.171
But were they
"coolest boat in the regatta" good?

15:22.254 --> 15:23.255
They were not.

15:23.339 --> 15:25.549
Dude, this boat is awesome.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.760
It makes me want to drink a pineapple.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.178
I want to see it in action!

15:29.261 --> 15:32.514
Yes. This lacks perspective.

15:33.140 --> 15:35.893
My friends, let's sail!

15:35.976 --> 15:37.686
You'll be cured in no time,

15:37.770 --> 15:39.146
right after the bats fly out

15:39.229 --> 15:41.815
and swarm your face
while flicking their dirty tongues

15:41.899 --> 15:43.192
against your cheeks.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.945
You know, I'm hogging all the attention.

15:46.028 --> 15:49.281
We've all got fears.
What about Bill's fear of balloons?

15:49.365 --> 15:51.992
-Where?
-He's just stalling.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.036
Come on, Bill. Let's grab some grub.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.704
We'll be back when you're cured!

15:55.913 --> 15:57.081
Good luck, Hank.

16:10.386 --> 16:11.261
Bobby?

16:12.721 --> 16:14.682
I'm king of the wo...

16:14.765 --> 16:16.308
Oh! Uh-oh.

16:18.352 --> 16:19.395
Whoa.

16:25.275 --> 16:27.736
Guys! I'm in trouble here!

16:29.363 --> 16:30.489
CHANE and JOSEPH All right!

16:31.782 --> 16:33.200
Bobby! Bobby!

16:48.048 --> 16:49.967
We were each expecting the other to pay.

16:50.050 --> 16:52.094
Turns out neither one of us has money.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.929
May I, Hank?

16:54.013 --> 16:56.557
Get your hand out of my pocket
and unchain me!

16:56.640 --> 16:59.101
Bobby's boat's falling apart.
He's gonna sink.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.144
Guys!

17:00.394 --> 17:02.187
Oh!

17:02.604 --> 17:04.523
Yeah!

17:10.446 --> 17:12.906
Bobby's gonna sink!

17:12.990 --> 17:14.825
Let me go, you idiots!

17:18.328 --> 17:19.204
Come on!

17:21.623 --> 17:22.541
Uh, no!

17:29.131 --> 17:30.007
Excuse me.

17:30.090 --> 17:34.386
I have mastered the freshman curriculum
and would like to further my education.

17:34.470 --> 17:35.679
What do you recommend?

17:36.180 --> 17:38.599
All's we gots is what we gots.

17:43.437 --> 17:45.856
Perhaps I've learned all this store
has to teach.

17:46.273 --> 17:47.107
Ah.

17:57.242 --> 18:01.163
"Mary Allison was shy, reserved,
naïve in the ways of love.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.457
That was about to change."

18:07.377 --> 18:08.253
Bobby!

18:10.547 --> 18:11.548
Dad!

18:11.632 --> 18:12.633
Are you okay?

18:12.716 --> 18:16.595
No. I got water pouring in.
The front corner's dropping hard.

18:16.678 --> 18:19.098
And my floor has totally quit on me.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.728
What are you doing? We're sinking!

18:24.812 --> 18:28.524
Not yet. Come on, Bobby.
You've worked too hard to just give up.

18:28.607 --> 18:29.608
We can save it.

18:31.944 --> 18:36.156
Looks like you secured your base rows
to your floorboards but not to each other.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.242
And three of your tanks
are filling with water.

18:38.325 --> 18:39.993
You must have pierced them with the drill.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.579
-I'm sorry!
-It's okay.

18:42.663 --> 18:45.040
First, we need a way to hold
your flooring together.

18:45.374 --> 18:46.458
Uh...

18:46.542 --> 18:47.960
What about the flags?

18:48.043 --> 18:49.545
Good thinking. Tear them off.

19:02.724 --> 19:03.809
Um...

19:03.892 --> 19:05.352
-Dad...
-Come on.

19:05.435 --> 19:08.689
I need you to tie this into a knot
and get the other straps around the base.

19:08.772 --> 19:10.858
But we're coming up on the bridge.

19:16.864 --> 19:19.658
It's okay. We're doing fine.

19:19.741 --> 19:21.827
We just need to get this flooring
bound together.

19:38.927 --> 19:42.931
Bobby, stay with me.
You need to tie the next two straps.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.142
I'm gonna dislodge the punctured tank.

19:47.728 --> 19:50.606
Come on, Bobby. Focus on the boat.
You can do this.

20:02.659 --> 20:04.870
Quick. Switch spots with me.
You're doing great.

20:18.091 --> 20:20.177
Well, this is a nice boat you've got here.

20:20.260 --> 20:23.847
Maybe for the regatta
we could add some hula ladies,

20:23.931 --> 20:26.558
play some Don Ho on the boom box...

20:26.642 --> 20:27.726
Okay, hear me out.

20:27.809 --> 20:30.979
You know,
I really can't think about that now, Dad.

20:31.063 --> 20:34.566
We've got some flotation issues
we need to address.

20:42.032 --> 20:43.450
I could barely breathe.

20:43.533 --> 20:45.911
Those ugly little devils were everywhere!

20:45.994 --> 20:47.162
Oh, my God!

20:47.246 --> 20:49.623
But my dad was in the zone.

20:49.706 --> 20:53.001
He didn't even flinch! It was amazing!

20:53.085 --> 20:56.880
So I tied the flooring while my dad pried
the tanks loose.

20:56.964 --> 20:59.383
It seemed like forever
but we got her afloat

20:59.466 --> 21:04.972
and out of the cave just as a million bats
exploded out into the night!

21:05.973 --> 21:09.810
Incredible!
Hank, you kicked your fear's butt.

21:09.893 --> 21:10.769
Yup.

21:55.230 --> 21:57.441
-<i>Somehow I always knew</i>
<i>it would come to this.</i>
