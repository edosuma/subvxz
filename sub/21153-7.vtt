WEBVTT

00:02.370 --> 00:03.580
JAMIE: Ten years ago,
the animal population mutated,

00:03.604 --> 00:05.739
endangering human
life on the planet.

00:05.773 --> 00:08.542
Our team managed to
cure the animals,

00:08.576 --> 00:11.345
but at a terrible cost.

00:11.379 --> 00:14.248
In an attempt to return
the planet to the animals,

00:14.282 --> 00:16.517
a secretive group called
the Shepherds released a gas

00:16.550 --> 00:20.388
that sterilized all of humanity.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.523
And then,
lab-made creatures called "hybrids"

00:22.556 --> 00:24.825
devastated the West Coast,

00:24.858 --> 00:26.627
so a massive barrier
was constructed

00:26.660 --> 00:29.197
to protect the rest
of North America,

00:29.230 --> 00:32.133
but new breeds have
started to appear,

00:32.165 --> 00:33.834
so we reassembled our team.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.537
We battle on many fronts,

00:36.570 --> 00:38.606
searching for a
cure to sterility

00:38.639 --> 00:42.243
while racing to stop the
hybrids and the rogue Shepherd

00:42.276 --> 00:45.313
who created them to
end the human race.

00:45.346 --> 00:49.550
The fight for mankind's
survival has just begun.

00:49.583 --> 00:52.420
Previously on Zoo...

00:52.453 --> 00:54.622
At day's end,
you'll have Clements and Lewis.

00:54.655 --> 00:57.725
Clem's baby could solve
the sterility problem?

00:57.758 --> 00:58.798
Are you proud of yourself?

00:58.826 --> 01:00.294
I'm so sorry.

01:00.328 --> 01:01.595
You kidnapped...

01:01.629 --> 01:03.307
How does that even
compute as right to you?

01:03.331 --> 01:04.697
It's not.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.134
ABRAHAM: Isaac is not safe.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.801
We have to go after Isaac.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.170
After you had the affair,

01:09.203 --> 01:10.371
all I saw was betrayal.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.373
Now Isaac is gone, I don't know

01:12.406 --> 01:14.708
how to look at you anymore.

01:14.742 --> 01:17.878
Jackson has a lead on someone
who might be Abigail's partner.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.180
Somebody named Mr. Duncan.

01:19.213 --> 01:20.114
What's this?

01:20.148 --> 01:22.716
It's a surveillance
photo of Mr. Duncan.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.253
He's public enemy number one,
but nobody knows where he is

01:25.286 --> 01:26.554
or even what he looks like.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.690
If I find him,
I'm going to take him down.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.595
♪

01:56.617 --> 01:57.751
Let's begin.

02:00.721 --> 02:02.723
Tell me what you see.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.825
A pony?

02:09.562 --> 02:10.663
And now what do you see?

02:10.698 --> 02:12.700
A car.

02:14.502 --> 02:17.638
How about you? What do you see?

02:17.671 --> 02:19.807
A house?

02:21.942 --> 02:25.313
This isn't working.
Run it again.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.781
There's a service road here,
just large enough for a landing.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.483
From there,
we head to this building.

02:29.517 --> 02:30.794
It's an old pharma
research facility.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.220
It's the only place large enough

02:32.253 --> 02:33.821
to stash that many
kids within 20 miles

02:33.854 --> 02:35.623
of the radiation
spike we detected.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.234
And we don't know what
kind of hostiles to expect.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.726
Abigail herself could be there.

02:38.759 --> 02:39.799
So we go in the southwest.

02:39.827 --> 02:40.661
More cover,

02:40.694 --> 02:42.696
no choke points.
JAMIE: I got access

02:42.730 --> 02:45.233
to thermal imaging from
the IADG satellite.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.368
This is from an hour ago.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.669
ABRAHAM: That's where Isaac is.

02:48.702 --> 02:49.837
It has to be.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.675
Tell me what you see.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.710
A fire truck?

02:56.744 --> 02:58.746
A crayon?

02:59.847 --> 03:01.315
A sandwich?

03:07.821 --> 03:09.890
You need to try harder.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.868
The Melvatox-B is allowing
their brains to operate

03:11.892 --> 03:13.761
on the same frequency
as the hybrids,

03:13.794 --> 03:15.729
but scaring them will
flood their brains

03:15.763 --> 03:18.332
with corticotrophin.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.968
Which could dilute the
Melvatox-B, you're right.

03:32.012 --> 03:34.848
Let's try this again.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.218
CLEMENTINE: Dad?

03:39.787 --> 03:41.822
We're gearing up.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.325
"We"?

03:44.358 --> 03:46.627
Yeah. I can help.

03:49.530 --> 03:52.300
Let's...
set aside the fact that Abe thinks

03:52.333 --> 03:55.769
the baby you're carrying could
jumpstart the human race.

03:55.803 --> 03:57.471
Dariela's gonna be
leading this mission

03:57.505 --> 03:59.740
and...
I don't trust her judgment.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.008
Not around you.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.344
She's only out to save her son.

04:03.377 --> 04:04.712
I don't blame her.

04:04.745 --> 04:05.913
I do.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.650
You're not going.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.055
Focus.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.890
What do you see now?

04:16.923 --> 04:21.462
Is it a white bunny with one
red eye and one blue eye?

04:27.335 --> 04:29.870
The zero frequency.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.605
Gives us bi-directional
communication

04:31.639 --> 04:34.608
between the hybrids
and our beacons.

04:34.642 --> 04:35.743
It worked.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.411
ABIGAIL: For hundreds of years,

04:37.445 --> 04:39.880
animals have served as guinea
pigs to benefit humans.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.450
Today we use humans
to benefit my hybrids.

04:42.483 --> 04:43.560
(alarm) AUTOMATED
VOICE: Warning.

04:43.584 --> 04:46.053
Security breach,
southwest perimeter.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.789
My brother. So smart.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.791
Take what you can,
wipe everything else.

04:50.824 --> 04:51.792
Round up the
razorbacks and meet me

04:51.825 --> 04:52.726
at the fallback position.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.828
What do you want to
do with the children?

04:54.862 --> 04:57.030
We don't need them anymore.
Where are you going?

04:57.064 --> 04:58.732
Abigail!

04:58.766 --> 05:00.401
(computer trilling)

05:00.434 --> 05:01.702
(door unlatches)

05:24.692 --> 05:26.026
Anything?

05:26.059 --> 05:27.495
Empty.

05:27.528 --> 05:28.862
Same. This isn't possible.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.740
There was heat-signature
confirmation on our descent.

05:30.764 --> 05:31.999
How can there be no one here?

05:32.032 --> 05:33.032
Let's keep looking.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.444
(sighs)

05:43.477 --> 05:45.012
They knew that we were coming.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.727
Well, that looks oddly familiar.

06:02.830 --> 06:03.931
JAMIE: It's a stasis tank.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.534
It's just like the
one you were in.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.068
What is it doing here?

06:13.040 --> 06:15.008
Wasn't Abigail dressed
as a cop in New York?

06:15.042 --> 06:16.477
Logan said he took
a shot at her.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.750
Well, it looks like he hit her.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.013
Guys, we have confirmation

06:20.047 --> 06:22.015
that Abigail has been on-site.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.122
(grunts)

06:29.156 --> 06:30.891
Abigail.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.627
And you must be Mitch Morgan's
daughter, Clementine.

06:33.661 --> 06:35.996
Now that we got that
out of the way...

06:43.070 --> 06:44.137
(grunts)

06:49.677 --> 06:52.012
(groans)

06:53.080 --> 06:55.749
(grunts)

07:05.092 --> 07:07.928
Abendegos. Where is he?

07:11.599 --> 07:13.000
Locked in the vehicle bay.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.869
(groans)

07:16.804 --> 07:18.138
(grunts)

07:46.667 --> 07:48.702
Mom? Dad?

07:48.736 --> 07:50.070
Isaac. Oh, my God.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.706
ABRAHAM: Isaac? DARIELA: Isaac?

07:52.740 --> 07:53.741
Isaac? I-I got him!

07:55.543 --> 07:57.110
Where is everybody else?

07:57.144 --> 08:00.981
Where are the adults?

08:01.014 --> 08:02.783
The lady said...

08:02.816 --> 08:05.185
"The game's over."

08:14.161 --> 08:15.596
(soft thuds)

08:15.629 --> 08:17.998
(low grunting, snorting)

08:23.236 --> 08:25.238
♪

08:36.049 --> 08:37.017
REPORTER: We're live
in upstate New York,

08:37.049 --> 08:38.628
at the dramatic recovery
of the missing children

08:38.652 --> 08:40.087
from the Reiden medical trials.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.731
With me is Detective
Logan Hale of the NYPD,

08:41.755 --> 08:44.157
who was instrumental in
finding this location.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.794
Detective, what happens next?

08:46.827 --> 08:49.129
Well, as you can see behind me,

08:49.162 --> 08:51.965
we have multiple agencies
working together to confirm

08:51.999 --> 08:54.143
the identities of each child
and to assess their health.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.278
Then we'll begin the process

08:55.302 --> 08:57.004
of reuniting them
with their families.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.247
Now,
we ask that all the families

08:58.271 --> 09:00.574
please refrain from coming here.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.285
We understand that you're
desperate to see your children,

09:02.309 --> 09:04.077
but it will only
slow things down.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.914
WOMAN: No,
we're gonna let the FBI handle that.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.048
One second.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.850
Detective,

09:09.883 --> 09:12.052
we found a series of tunnels
underneath the facility.

09:12.085 --> 09:15.656
That's how Abigail Westbrook
and her people got out.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.891
I want BOLOs out to all
the local law enforcement,

09:17.925 --> 09:20.694
and the border patrol,
in case she tries to run to Canada.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.062
AGENT: Okay.

09:22.095 --> 09:25.132
You should still get Isaac
checked out by a doctor,

09:25.165 --> 09:26.834
but I'm not seeing any problems.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.069
Your boy seems fine.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.104
We missed you so much, Isaac.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.106
I told everybody you
were going to rescue us.

09:33.140 --> 09:34.742
(laughs) Isaac,

09:34.775 --> 09:36.744
what was it like in there?

09:36.777 --> 09:39.680
Well... We don't have to
talk about that right now.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.281
What matters is that
we got you back.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.386
Hey.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.064
Isaac's been cleared,
we're getting out of here.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.056
What are you doing?

09:49.089 --> 09:51.725
Well, Logan had to jump
through a bunch of hoops

09:51.759 --> 09:54.061
to get the Feds to okay
it, but...

09:54.094 --> 09:56.764
we're taking this thing with us.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.301
Well, that's not the worst idea.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.205
You know, I'd... I know that

10:05.238 --> 10:07.775
you lost ten years of your life
to one of these things, Mitch,

10:07.808 --> 10:08.909
and you probably hate it.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.078
But if we can get
under the hood,

10:11.111 --> 10:14.281
there is no telling what
we can learn about Abigail.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.116
I'm more concerned about

10:16.149 --> 10:18.719
how you think you're going
to get it back to the plane.

10:18.752 --> 10:21.321
Let's get Logan to do it.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.273
I don't care if the closest
neighbor is a mile away,

10:30.297 --> 10:31.431
I want to talk to them.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.301
Okay. Detective Hale,

10:34.334 --> 10:36.870
can I interest you
in a bear claw?

10:38.038 --> 10:39.206
Excuse me?

10:39.239 --> 10:41.441
My wife won't allow
me to touch sweets,

10:41.474 --> 10:44.745
but, uh, I have a 100-mile rule.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.289
Whenever I'm more than
100 miles from home,

10:46.313 --> 10:48.081
I can eat whatever I want.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.083
My weakness is Boston cream.

10:50.117 --> 10:52.152
Great,
I'm happy that I know that now.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.420
What do you want?

10:54.988 --> 10:56.423
Never seen an IADG clearance

10:56.456 --> 10:59.827
quite that high before...
Agent Garrison.

10:59.860 --> 11:00.928
What do you want?

11:00.961 --> 11:02.730
I've had my eye on you

11:02.763 --> 11:04.364
for quite some time, Detective.

11:04.397 --> 11:07.868
Catching the Serenity
Killer as a patrolman,

11:07.901 --> 11:10.003
infiltrating a Shepherd
sleeper cell...

11:10.037 --> 11:13.273
Right, so...
so you can read my CV. And?

11:13.306 --> 11:15.108
And this.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.779
What am I looking at?

11:18.812 --> 11:20.180
Four hikers were found dead

11:20.213 --> 11:21.882
in the Black Forest, in Germany.

11:21.915 --> 11:25.118
The coroner ruled they
died after inhaling

11:25.152 --> 11:26.353
an unidentified toxin.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.188
I'm in the NYPD.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.265
That's a little outside
of my jurisdiction.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.191
The autopsy also showed

11:31.224 --> 11:36.296
trace amounts of hybrid
DNA on the bodies.

11:36.329 --> 11:37.865
There are no hybrids in Germany

11:37.898 --> 11:39.308
or anyplace else outside
of North or South America.

11:39.332 --> 11:40.734
It's a mystery.

11:40.768 --> 11:42.736
One we'd like you
to help us solve.

11:42.770 --> 11:45.205
I'm a New York cop. Why me?

11:45.238 --> 11:46.974
You have a history
with the hybrids.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.441
Ten years ago,
you were on an island

11:48.475 --> 11:49.509
facing down razorbacks

11:49.542 --> 11:51.244
before the rest of the world

11:51.278 --> 11:53.146
knew they existed. Really?

11:53.180 --> 11:54.882
I think you got some
bad intel there.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.249
Detective, please,

11:56.283 --> 11:59.286
I'm well aware of
your former life.

11:59.319 --> 12:02.422
Fine. Still not interested.

12:02.455 --> 12:05.993
Tarapoto, Peru.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.370
That's where your
teammates will find

12:07.394 --> 12:08.796
the next hybrid
they're looking for.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.298
And how the hell did
you know about that?

12:11.331 --> 12:13.233
Are you gonna stand
there asking questions,

12:13.266 --> 12:14.377
or are you gonna accept my offer

12:14.401 --> 12:16.336
and start getting some answers?

12:26.279 --> 12:28.348
Got something for you.
What is it?

12:28.381 --> 12:31.318
Three refugee camps near
Tarapoto, Peru,

12:31.351 --> 12:32.252
were attacked last week.

12:32.285 --> 12:35.255
Eyewitness accounts say
that the creature is

12:35.288 --> 12:37.390
some kind of a ghost.

12:37.424 --> 12:40.027
That disc contains reports
that argue that this "ghost"

12:40.060 --> 12:41.895
is actually a new hybrid.

12:41.929 --> 12:44.031
Well, that's convenient.

12:44.064 --> 12:47.400
Abe said we needed spinal
fluid from new hybrids.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.336
Where'd you get it?

12:49.369 --> 12:51.338
I made some new friends.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.276
So this is the end
of the line for me.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.578
I've been given an opportunity,

12:58.611 --> 13:02.115
and I won't be getting back
on the plane with you guys.

13:02.149 --> 13:05.352
What?
You're leaving the team now?

13:05.385 --> 13:06.385
To do what?

13:08.288 --> 13:09.923
It's classified.

13:09.957 --> 13:12.993
Seriously? Seriously.

13:15.028 --> 13:16.563
Is this about Mitch?

13:16.596 --> 13:19.132
I won't lie.

13:21.534 --> 13:24.471
I mean,
if I thought that there was...

13:24.504 --> 13:29.442
a future for you and
me, I might stay.

13:29.476 --> 13:32.445
But given the state of things,

13:32.479 --> 13:36.283
I just think that this
makes the most sense for me.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.286
But if you need anything,

13:39.319 --> 13:41.855
you know how to reach me.

13:41.889 --> 13:44.491
You're not joining a
cult, are you?

13:44.524 --> 13:46.459
(laughs)

13:50.430 --> 13:52.499
I'll see you around, okay?

14:03.343 --> 14:04.978
CLEMENTINE: You found the kids?

14:05.012 --> 14:08.448
Yeah, so that's one in the win
column, finally.

14:08.481 --> 14:09.993
I need to go see if
that image of Mr. Duncan

14:10.017 --> 14:11.384
is finished processing.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.987
Yeah, I forgot to tell you,

14:14.021 --> 14:15.222
error message came up...

14:15.255 --> 14:17.090
Something about
a corrupted file.

14:17.124 --> 14:19.592
I'll go check.

14:22.629 --> 14:25.598
I'll uh, prep the gear for Peru.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.567
We're gonna need live
rounds, no tranqs.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.369
We're going to Peru? Yeah.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.571
MITCH: We got intel on
a new hybrid out there.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.340
We need some more spinal fluid.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.541
And with Abigail in the wind,

14:34.574 --> 14:37.044
it's pretty much our only play.

14:39.479 --> 14:40.480
Abigail was here.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.449
I'm sorry, what? What?

14:42.482 --> 14:44.952
What do you mean,
Abigail was here?

14:44.985 --> 14:46.954
Are you okay? She hurt you?

14:46.987 --> 14:49.322
No, she didn't touch
me, but, um,

14:49.356 --> 14:50.590
she got Abendegos.

14:50.623 --> 14:53.426
I'm so sorry.
JACKSON: Okay, Clem,

14:53.460 --> 14:56.429
I need you to walk me through
everything that she said.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.431
Okay?

14:58.465 --> 14:59.466
You sure you're okay?

14:59.499 --> 15:01.368
Yeah, I'm fine.

15:09.442 --> 15:10.719
JAMIE: The hybrids
swept through here

15:10.743 --> 15:13.213
on their way from
Pangaea to North America.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.048
We thought they'd
all cleared out.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.092
I gotta say,
you've been taking me to some

15:16.116 --> 15:17.250
very romantic spots

15:17.284 --> 15:19.486
since I've been back.

15:19.519 --> 15:24.091
You catching that charming
smell of death out here?

15:24.124 --> 15:25.692
I've been in worse.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.560
Back when I was an
intern at the zoo,

15:27.594 --> 15:30.030
my first job was
piling up the dung

15:30.063 --> 15:31.698
in the elephant habitat.

15:31.731 --> 15:35.435
I one time chased a
Shepherd in a sewer

15:35.468 --> 15:38.671
under a tandoori restaurant.

15:38.705 --> 15:40.440
Winner. (rustling)

15:40.473 --> 15:43.143
(growling)

15:50.583 --> 15:53.320
Tell me you just saw that.

15:53.353 --> 15:54.721
What the hell?

15:54.754 --> 15:56.589
Did that wolf just teleport?

15:56.623 --> 15:58.358
Maybe.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.162
Mitch.

16:09.636 --> 16:13.206
Max?

16:13.240 --> 16:15.042
Jamie?

16:22.515 --> 16:24.684
Sorry about that, son.

16:32.459 --> 16:34.370
FEMALE PUNDIT (on radio): Reiden Global claimed
they took the children to cure sterility.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.563
If that was a lie,
I want an explanation.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.241
MALE PUNDIT: At least
yesterday there was hope...

16:38.265 --> 16:39.666
Hope for a cure... (sighs)

16:39.699 --> 16:41.434
The world is going to hell.

16:41.468 --> 16:42.702
(wrench clatters)

16:42.735 --> 16:44.537
Looks like it's going well.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.539
I can't get this thing to work.

16:46.573 --> 16:49.409
Look, Abigail is constantly
one step ahead of us,

16:49.442 --> 16:50.682
and we are running out of time.

16:50.710 --> 16:53.180
If we can just get
this thing to power up,

16:53.213 --> 16:55.124
we might be able to get
to the data it has inside,

16:55.148 --> 16:57.750
find out where she's been,
and maybe where she's going.

16:57.784 --> 17:01.188
I've read studies
about tanks like these,

17:01.221 --> 17:03.590
theories about how they work.

17:03.623 --> 17:06.126
A combination of
experimental trauma treatment

17:06.159 --> 17:09.296
and induced hibernation.

17:09.329 --> 17:12.499
I never thought anyone
had actually built one.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.803
That vent is for airflow.

17:16.836 --> 17:20.540
The power supply system is
just like an electrical car.

17:20.573 --> 17:23.476
That thing is the
electric control actuator.

17:23.510 --> 17:28.481
Now we just need to
find the ignition coil.

17:28.515 --> 17:30.049
Here, try the, uh,
circuit tester.

17:35.488 --> 17:39.226
Clem, what's going on?

17:39.259 --> 17:43.196
Okay, so Abigail and I got
into a bit of a catfight.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.198
But I'm fine.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.134
Really.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.536
I'll be the judge of that.
Go take a seat.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.671
This is why I didn't want
to tell you guys earlier.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.206
I don't want you
worrying about me.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.375
You have your own stuff
you should be focusing on.

17:55.408 --> 17:58.378
Clem, you're carrying the baby
that could save the world.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.651
There's really nothing more
important than you right now.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.618
JACKSON: I get it.

18:05.652 --> 18:08.421
Ten years ago,
I was in your shoes.

18:08.455 --> 18:09.622
Pregnant?

18:09.656 --> 18:11.424
(chuckles)

18:11.458 --> 18:13.426
Carrying the cure
inside my blood.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.262
No pressure, right?

18:17.664 --> 18:20.767
So what did you do when
it all got to be too much?

18:20.800 --> 18:22.435
Alcohol.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.437
That's not really
an option for me.

18:24.471 --> 18:27.674
Having people around me that I
could trust didn't hurt, either.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.647
What?

18:34.681 --> 18:37.650
I'm sure it's nothing.

18:37.684 --> 18:38.918
I need to extract some blood.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.288
I'll go get my kit.

18:46.826 --> 18:47.727
What happened?

18:47.760 --> 18:50.530
You don't remember?

18:50.563 --> 18:52.365
Oh...

18:52.399 --> 18:53.633
Max?

18:53.666 --> 18:55.468
Easy, easy. Come on.

18:55.502 --> 18:56.645
Look,
the dart that I shot you with

18:56.669 --> 18:57.737
is not meant for humans.

18:57.770 --> 18:58.947
It's ketamine mixed
with atropine.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.508
A side effect is
temporary amnesia.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.676
You shot me with a PL4 tranq.

19:03.710 --> 19:04.844
Why? It was an accident.

19:04.877 --> 19:06.913
I'm sorry.

19:06.946 --> 19:08.281
Probably lost a half an hour.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.351
You know I just lost a
decade, right?

19:11.384 --> 19:14.687
(laughs): Okay.
You want to take another 30 minutes?

19:14.721 --> 19:16.456
What are you doing here, Max?

19:16.489 --> 19:19.659
What are you doing here?
And how's Clementine?

19:21.794 --> 19:22.929
How's the baby?

19:22.962 --> 19:26.199
How'd you know she was with us?

19:26.233 --> 19:28.568
And how do you know
she's pregnant?

19:29.769 --> 19:31.704
She called me.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.940
So you knew I was alive,

19:33.973 --> 19:35.842
and you... you didn't call me.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.710
MAX: Who's supposed
to notify who

19:37.744 --> 19:39.746
when somebody's
resurrected from the dead?

19:39.779 --> 19:40.880
As far as I'm concerned,

19:40.913 --> 19:42.258
it should be the one
who's resurrected.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.850
Yeah? That's the protocol?

19:43.883 --> 19:46.753
Well, Jesus only took 40
days to let his people know.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.855
All right!
Max, what are you doing here?

19:48.888 --> 19:51.424
There are rumors that
there's a 60-foot snake,

19:51.458 --> 19:52.659
high as a man's waist,

19:52.692 --> 19:54.961
roaming in this area. Of course.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.939
And here's the thing...
No one's actually seen it.

19:56.963 --> 19:59.566
Like a ghost snake.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.234
Exactly.

20:01.268 --> 20:03.603
And I have, uh,
fine-tuned this device

20:03.636 --> 20:05.905
to detect the heartbeat
of a snake that size

20:05.938 --> 20:07.774
when it's within range.

20:07.807 --> 20:10.877
I've come close.
Haven't actually seen it.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.879
That's what I do.
I'm a cryptozoologist.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.282
And this is my white whale.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.784
I think we're looking
for the same thing.

20:20.920 --> 20:25.224
Hey, I miss this. (chuckles)

20:27.460 --> 20:29.929
Isaac,

20:29.962 --> 20:32.699
why don't you tell us a
little about what happened

20:32.732 --> 20:33.966
inside that place?

20:36.569 --> 20:38.771
We didn't go outside.

20:38.805 --> 20:42.275
They gave us candy.
We played games.

20:42.309 --> 20:45.011
Like sports? No.

20:45.044 --> 20:48.281
The teacher called
them "guessing games."

20:48.315 --> 20:49.816
They were more like tests.

20:49.849 --> 20:52.819
We had to say what
we saw in our heads.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.854
I never got it right, though.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.658
Can I go watch TV? Sure.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.034
What did they do to him?

21:08.067 --> 21:11.804
The candy,
the images in his mind...

21:11.838 --> 21:14.073
We know that Melvatox-B
affects young brains.

21:14.106 --> 21:17.009
In the '60s,
the CIA ran all kinds

21:17.043 --> 21:18.778
of cognitive tests with drugs...

21:18.811 --> 21:22.749
LSD, MK Ultra...
To study side effects.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.817
Thankfully,
there's no trace of Melvatox-B

21:24.851 --> 21:26.052
in his system anymore.

21:26.085 --> 21:28.054
His tox screen came back clean.

21:28.087 --> 21:29.822
So he's fine.

21:29.856 --> 21:31.424
Are you sure?

21:31.458 --> 21:34.361
As sure as I can be.

21:37.096 --> 21:38.898
All right,
I'm gonna adjust the charge,

21:38.931 --> 21:39.932
so get ready.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.604
Did you check the
camshaft sensor?

21:44.637 --> 21:45.938
Yeah, twice.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.407
(electricity crackles)

21:47.440 --> 21:48.917
What'd you do?
This thing is overloading.

21:48.941 --> 21:50.510
Okay. Pull the fuse.

21:50.543 --> 21:51.744
All right. No. Not the relay,

21:51.778 --> 21:53.813
pull the terminal.
The whole thing.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.948
All right. I'm just a little lost
here, I'm sorry.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.984
Maybe this?

21:58.017 --> 22:00.119
(tank powering up)

22:00.152 --> 22:01.888
Hey.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.356
(chuckles)

22:03.390 --> 22:05.692
We got the data.

22:05.725 --> 22:07.560
"Eight hours of
cellular regeneration,

22:07.594 --> 22:08.695
hyper tissue mitosis..."

22:08.728 --> 22:10.096
You did it?

22:12.932 --> 22:15.702
ABRAHAM: These records are exact
details of what was done to her.

22:15.735 --> 22:18.037
I wonder what else this
thing knows about Abigail.

22:18.070 --> 22:19.939
So do I.

22:19.972 --> 22:21.908
But it will have to wait.

22:21.941 --> 22:24.711
I'm here because
we need to talk.

22:24.744 --> 22:28.014
I got your blood
test results back.

22:28.047 --> 22:29.949
None of this makes any sense.

22:29.982 --> 22:31.984
I see the wolf's paw prints
coming into the area,

22:32.018 --> 22:34.854
but not going.

22:34.887 --> 22:38.991
Okay, you said your mythical
snake is 60 feet long?

22:39.025 --> 22:41.861
Yeah. That'd give it a diameter
of, what,

22:41.894 --> 22:44.397
40 inches, right?
Uh, give or take. Why?

22:44.431 --> 22:46.766
Let's say your snake does exist,

22:46.799 --> 22:50.470
but nobody can find it
because nobody can see it.

22:50.503 --> 22:52.472
What,
you're saying it's invisible?

22:52.505 --> 22:54.941
Not exactly.

22:54.974 --> 22:56.876
Go with me here.

22:56.909 --> 22:59.121
Uh, snakes are already pretty
good at camouflaging themselves

22:59.145 --> 23:00.747
when they're not moving.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.449
Right.
What if this snake is a hybrid

23:02.482 --> 23:04.083
that has just taken

23:04.116 --> 23:06.919
its camouflage talents
one step further?

23:06.953 --> 23:08.955
So it can blend into
its surroundings,

23:08.988 --> 23:11.658
even when it's in motion.

23:11.691 --> 23:13.560
See that tree?

23:13.593 --> 23:15.495
If the snake came
in through there,

23:15.528 --> 23:18.164
ate the wolf,
it would look like it just disappeared.

23:18.197 --> 23:20.967
MAX: Snakes don't
just gulp their prey.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.003
They crush them to death first,
and then slowly eat them.

23:24.036 --> 23:25.805
Other animals swallow
their prey whole.

23:25.838 --> 23:28.174
Monkfish, certain frogs.

23:28.207 --> 23:30.677
Maybe this snake is just
borrowing one of their tricks.

23:30.710 --> 23:31.987
(chuckles) JAMIE:
Yeah, but if it can do

23:32.011 --> 23:34.146
all that,
how are we gonna find it?

23:34.180 --> 23:36.916
Well, if we can't see it,
we, we'll follow its path.

23:36.949 --> 23:39.018
A snake would return
to its lair to digest.

23:39.051 --> 23:40.687
We got to find its den.
That way.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.722
(birds chirping)

23:45.958 --> 23:49.862
Your baby has HDF,
hemolytic disease.

23:49.896 --> 23:51.498
It's a blood disorder.

23:51.531 --> 23:55.234
In short, your blood has
mixed with the baby's,

23:55.267 --> 23:57.136
and your body is
creating antibodies

23:57.169 --> 23:59.539
that are attacking
the baby's blood.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.207
What do we do?

24:01.240 --> 24:03.943
Your baby's blood type
is extremely rare.

24:03.976 --> 24:06.078
I've already called
numerous blood banks,

24:06.112 --> 24:08.748
but it could take
weeks to find a match.

24:08.781 --> 24:11.017
If we had the father's blood,

24:11.050 --> 24:13.820
I could do an
exchange transfusion,

24:13.853 --> 24:16.689
literally replace
the baby's blood.

24:20.259 --> 24:22.829
His name is Sam Parker.

24:22.862 --> 24:24.997
We met about three
months ago in Colorado,

24:25.031 --> 24:27.967
but I don't know
where he's living now.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.271
We have to do everything
we can to locate Sam.

24:32.304 --> 24:36.509
If we get his blood in time,
your baby will survive.

24:36.543 --> 24:38.978
Clem,
you got to tell me everything

24:39.011 --> 24:42.148
you know about him,
and I'll start tracking him down.

24:42.181 --> 24:44.250
(quietly): Yeah.

24:44.283 --> 24:45.952
So Jamie, I take it

24:45.985 --> 24:47.687
you're back together
with my son?

24:47.720 --> 24:49.556
What are you doing?

24:49.589 --> 24:51.257
What? I can't be happy

24:51.290 --> 24:53.826
my son's back in a
meaningful relationship?

24:53.860 --> 24:55.261
Oh, right.

24:55.294 --> 24:57.005
Because as soon as I
confirm that's the case,

24:57.029 --> 24:59.098
that'll be your cue
to make a move on her.

24:59.131 --> 25:00.633
That didn't take long, did it?

25:00.667 --> 25:01.968
I've changed.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.870
MITCH: Yes, I'm sure you have.

25:03.903 --> 25:05.071
Isn't it enough

25:05.104 --> 25:06.973
you just "accidentally"
shot me in the neck?

25:07.006 --> 25:09.108
You got to pretend to care
about my happiness, too?

25:09.141 --> 25:11.277
I swear, I don't know how
you've become so cynical.

25:11.310 --> 25:13.012
I learned it.

25:13.045 --> 25:16.816
From the same guy who taught me
about meaningful relationships.

25:16.849 --> 25:19.051
Look, Jamie is the
person that I trust most.

25:19.085 --> 25:20.853
Okay?
Let's just leave it at that.

25:22.589 --> 25:24.624
Hey, guys,
I followed the pattern

25:24.657 --> 25:26.125
of broken branches
to that building.

25:26.158 --> 25:27.927
I think I found the snake den.

25:36.102 --> 25:38.671
(detector clicking)

25:38.705 --> 25:40.072
MITCH: Okay, Max.

25:40.106 --> 25:41.808
Yeah.

25:41.841 --> 25:45.211
I'm gonna need some spinal
fluid from your snake.

25:45.244 --> 25:47.947
How much spinal fluid?

25:47.980 --> 25:52.218
Well, if it's as big as you say it
is, uh, about 250 cc's?

25:52.251 --> 25:54.787
You can't do that,
it'll kill it.

25:54.821 --> 25:56.222
What are you doing?

25:58.124 --> 26:00.993
While you guys debate the
bioethics of invisible snakes,

26:01.027 --> 26:03.162
I think I know a way to see it.

26:03.195 --> 26:04.235
(fire extinguisher sprays)

26:10.102 --> 26:11.671
MAX: Anacondas and pythons

26:11.704 --> 26:15.141
can survive for 14
weeks without food.

26:15.174 --> 26:19.211
Our window for catching this thing
is, is closing.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.915
(detector clicking rapidly)

26:28.354 --> 26:30.356
(clattering)

26:32.659 --> 26:34.393
Think your white whale's here, Max.
Hmm.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.796
(hissing)

26:57.383 --> 26:59.686
(hissing)

27:05.825 --> 27:08.728
(roars)

27:08.761 --> 27:10.229
No, don't kill it!

27:10.262 --> 27:11.798
(gunshot ricochets)

27:20.039 --> 27:21.349
What the hell are you doing, Max?
Jamie?

27:21.373 --> 27:23.810
This reptile can cloak itself.

27:28.014 --> 27:29.148
(panting)

27:29.181 --> 27:30.950
(grunts)

27:30.983 --> 27:32.985
Can you imagine the
scientific possibilities?

27:33.019 --> 27:34.687
What the military would pay us

27:34.721 --> 27:36.098
if we could understand
how it works?

27:36.122 --> 27:37.289
There it is. Huh?

27:37.323 --> 27:38.791
I knew you had an angle.

27:38.825 --> 27:40.827
(scuffing, slithering sounds)

27:45.164 --> 27:46.933
We are gonna neutralize
this snake... Yeah.

27:46.966 --> 27:47.466
We're gonna get
its spinal fluid.

27:47.499 --> 27:48.200
If it dies, it dies.

27:48.234 --> 27:50.002
End of story.

27:57.309 --> 27:58.377
(metal clatters)

27:58.410 --> 28:00.312
Jamie. Yeah.

28:09.455 --> 28:10.990
Jamie?

28:11.023 --> 28:12.725
Jamie!

28:12.759 --> 28:14.093
Jamie! Jamie!

28:15.427 --> 28:17.363
JACKSON: Not surprising,
but there's over

28:17.396 --> 28:19.899
a hundred Sam Parkers
in 32 different states,

28:19.932 --> 28:21.333
including Alaska.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.169
Still? In every populated one,

28:23.202 --> 28:26.338
up to the barrier.
You said you met him in Colorado?

28:26.372 --> 28:28.374
Yeah, uh,
he worked near the barrier.

28:28.407 --> 28:30.877
He was building homes
for hybrid victims

28:30.910 --> 28:33.913
at, uh, the Hope Foundation.

28:36.415 --> 28:39.351
According to their Web
site, the Hope org

28:39.385 --> 28:40.395
worked all along the barrier,

28:40.419 --> 28:43.455
even into Canada and
Mexico, so...

28:43.489 --> 28:45.324
All right,
tell me more about him.

28:45.357 --> 28:47.326
You know, maybe we can
find out where he went.

28:47.359 --> 28:51.063
He liked country
music, drank gin,

28:51.097 --> 28:53.099
had a red Ford pickup.

28:53.132 --> 28:56.368
I don't know, that's about it.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.004
You know, Clem,

28:58.037 --> 28:59.772
I've been hurt, too.

28:59.806 --> 29:01.007
(laughs softly)

29:01.040 --> 29:03.475
I know how it is.

29:03.509 --> 29:07.313
I, uh, was waiting on intel

29:07.346 --> 29:10.950
about a decommissioned
Shepherd facility.

29:10.983 --> 29:13.820
That's when I met Sam.

29:13.853 --> 29:15.822
He had these kind eyes.

29:15.855 --> 29:18.457
Uh, we started talking
and, I don't know,

29:18.490 --> 29:20.459
just kind of clicked.

29:20.492 --> 29:22.929
He asked me out on a date.

29:22.962 --> 29:25.297
The world being what it
is, and this guy,

29:25.331 --> 29:30.069
he shows up with a bouquet of
wildflowers and asks me out.

29:32.872 --> 29:35.041
Uh, we were together
every day and night.

29:35.074 --> 29:37.276
Till I got confirmation

29:37.309 --> 29:41.280
that the Shepherd facility was
somewhere in Eastern Europe.

29:41.313 --> 29:44.316
I had to go, it was the most
solid lead I'd gotten in months.

29:44.350 --> 29:46.853
And you didn't want him to know.

29:46.886 --> 29:48.955
How would I even explain it?

29:48.988 --> 29:52.358
So I pulled a guy move

29:52.391 --> 29:55.394
and I snuck out in the
middle of the night.

29:58.030 --> 29:59.431
I didn't leave a note.

29:59.465 --> 30:01.367
And I never looked back.

30:04.036 --> 30:07.406
Now I have to tell him that
we're having a child together.

30:09.508 --> 30:12.111
I doubt he'll ever
speak to me again.

30:14.413 --> 30:17.483
When he knows what's at stake,

30:17.516 --> 30:21.220
I promise you, he will.

30:33.065 --> 30:35.034
Where's Isaac?

30:35.067 --> 30:37.469
In the bedroom.

30:37.503 --> 30:40.372
Reading the plane's
flight manual.

30:40.406 --> 30:42.241
Again.

30:42.274 --> 30:44.510
(chuckles)

30:46.412 --> 30:48.948
When are we going home?

30:48.981 --> 30:52.384
Look, I was hoping we
could all stay together.

30:52.418 --> 30:53.585
The work we're doing here...

30:53.619 --> 30:55.387
Abe, I know it's important.

30:55.421 --> 30:58.224
But this plane's
no place for a kid.

30:58.257 --> 30:59.525
Isaac's important, too.

31:01.393 --> 31:04.030
When we first met,

31:04.063 --> 31:05.564
there was nothing
you wouldn't do

31:05.597 --> 31:08.467
for our missions and for
this family on this plane.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.103
Mitch can barely look at me.

31:11.137 --> 31:13.605
We're not that family anymore.

31:17.076 --> 31:20.346
Abe, I think it's
best I take Isaac...

31:20.379 --> 31:21.547
and leave.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.382
And I want you to come with us.

31:23.415 --> 31:25.484
I can't do that.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.186
I know.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.588
And that's what's killing me.

31:29.621 --> 31:32.524
You need to be
here for the team.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.326
Looking out for
Clem and her baby.

31:34.360 --> 31:37.596
But one of us has to
look out for Isaac.

31:44.003 --> 31:47.506
Clem, I had Logan check
the national PNC database.

31:47.539 --> 31:51.510
A 1988 red Ford pickup
registered to a Sam Parker

31:51.543 --> 31:54.146
got a speeding ticket
in Pittsburgh yesterday.

31:54.180 --> 31:55.590
You said that's where
his parents live, right?

31:55.614 --> 31:57.383
Yeah.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.561
We'll set a course for there
after your dad and Jamie return.

31:59.585 --> 32:01.587
We don't know if
he's still there.

32:03.622 --> 32:05.457
I've had my heart broken.

32:05.491 --> 32:09.261
Home is where I'd go.

32:09.295 --> 32:11.730
MITCH: Jamie? MAX: Jamie?

32:11.763 --> 32:14.466
(clattering)

32:14.500 --> 32:17.469
(slithering, hissing)

32:21.273 --> 32:23.309
(snake screeching)

32:33.785 --> 32:35.554
(snake continues screeching)

32:44.663 --> 32:46.465
(panting)

32:46.498 --> 32:48.534
Still not the worst
place I've ever been.

33:13.459 --> 33:15.327
DARIELA: The cat dragged
this one in again.

33:15.361 --> 33:16.728
Well, it's quite a homecoming.

33:16.762 --> 33:18.564
Nice to see you again, Mrs.
Kenyatta.

33:18.597 --> 33:19.665
We got the spinal fluid.

33:19.698 --> 33:20.566
From a herd of what?

33:20.599 --> 33:22.734
You guys look terrible,
and that smell...

33:22.768 --> 33:24.070
You don't want to know.

33:24.103 --> 33:25.637
We got to get this
plane up in the air.

33:25.671 --> 33:26.505
Why? What's wrong?

33:26.538 --> 33:27.673
It's Clem.

33:30.109 --> 33:32.811
Of course I checked.
Their blood is incompatible.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.646
How can you be so sure, Abe?

33:34.680 --> 33:36.424
I mean, no offense, pal,
but you've been a doctor

33:36.448 --> 33:37.549
for all of what? 20 minutes?

33:37.583 --> 33:39.818
Please.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.653
What does this
mean for the baby?

33:41.687 --> 33:44.656
It won't survive if it doesn't
get a blood transfusion

33:44.690 --> 33:46.692
in the next three days.
MAX: Maybe less.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.827
Transfusion from the
father is the only solve.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.105
Well,
we're on our way to him now.

33:50.129 --> 33:51.497
We are? Great. Who is this guy?

33:51.530 --> 33:52.831
His name is Sam Parker.

33:52.864 --> 33:53.799
Maybe after we cure sterility,

33:53.832 --> 33:55.401
we can all go to dinner

33:55.434 --> 33:56.568
and you can grill him then.

33:56.602 --> 33:58.804
ABRAHAM: We're flying into
Pittsburgh now to find him.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.837
But there is no guarantee
we'll get to him on time.

34:03.575 --> 34:05.177
JACKSON: Okay.

34:05.211 --> 34:08.714
No one wants to say
it, but, uh...

34:08.746 --> 34:10.581
what about the tank?

34:10.616 --> 34:12.818
What? No. Nope.

34:12.851 --> 34:15.087
That's not...
that's not an option.

34:15.121 --> 34:17.331
That's not gonna...
You-you know what, it-it kept you alive

34:17.356 --> 34:19.291
and in stasis for-for ten years.

34:19.324 --> 34:21.127
ABRAHAM: It may not

34:21.159 --> 34:22.728
cure the baby,

34:22.761 --> 34:25.597
but it will prevent the
HDF from getting worse

34:25.630 --> 34:28.766
while we work on a more
permanent solution.

34:28.800 --> 34:31.570
But our opinion is not
the most important here.

34:33.472 --> 34:35.841
If it'll save my
baby, I'll do it.

34:35.873 --> 34:38.277
Clem. Dad.

34:38.310 --> 34:40.846
I know you just
want to protect me.

34:40.879 --> 34:42.514
We're the only
family we have left,

34:42.547 --> 34:45.217
but these people are our
family, too.

34:45.251 --> 34:47.853
They helped me find you and
they brought us back together.

34:47.886 --> 34:49.821
They made sure you were safe

34:49.855 --> 34:52.658
and I know they'll do the
same for me and this baby.

34:54.893 --> 34:57.263
JAMIE: We're all gonna
be here when you wake up.

34:58.497 --> 35:01.099
I'll find Sam. I promise.

35:02.201 --> 35:04.570
This isn't good-bye, okay?

35:04.603 --> 35:07.873
I'm just unplugging for a bit.

35:07.906 --> 35:11.143
You don't have to
be all sentimental.

35:18.784 --> 35:21.587
I, uh, think it's time.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.889
We should give them some space.

35:23.922 --> 35:26.892
This should be family only.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.894
MITCH: No.

35:28.927 --> 35:31.430
Stay.

35:32.664 --> 35:34.132
Please.

35:36.468 --> 35:39.238
Clem was right.

35:39.271 --> 35:41.273
Everybody here is family.

Yeah.

Hey, Jamie, how are you doing?

37:01.353 --> 37:03.955
Hey. How are you?

37:03.989 --> 37:08.327
Well, I keep telling myself
that, uh, Mitch spent ten years

37:08.360 --> 37:11.697
in one of those tanks and
he came out just fine, so...

37:11.730 --> 37:13.965
Clementine should, too, right?

37:13.999 --> 37:16.001
She'll be okay.

37:16.034 --> 37:17.035
The baby, too.

37:17.068 --> 37:22.007
We have two... well...
well, make that three...

37:22.040 --> 37:24.643
Of the best scientists in
the world on this plane.

37:24.676 --> 37:26.912
(chuckles)

37:26.945 --> 37:28.414
That's interesting.

37:31.016 --> 37:33.060
What kind of crazy compound
is my son working on now?

37:33.084 --> 37:34.486
What do you mean?

37:34.520 --> 37:35.487
See that sequence

37:35.521 --> 37:36.488
of covalent bonds?

37:36.522 --> 37:37.489
That's Mitch's signature.

37:37.523 --> 37:39.991
(chuckles)

37:40.025 --> 37:42.494
It's kind of an inside
joke only scientists get.

37:42.528 --> 37:43.695
Mitch?

37:43.729 --> 37:45.931
Are you sure?

37:45.964 --> 37:47.999
I'm positive.

37:48.033 --> 37:50.669
See the bond angle and
the spatial orientation?

37:50.702 --> 37:52.871
(fading): That's-that's all him.

37:52.904 --> 37:56.875
First time he used it was his
high school science project.

37:56.908 --> 37:59.445
It's kind of been
his thing ever since.

37:59.478 --> 38:01.880
I don't even think
it's intentional...

You once told me
it never mattered

38:45.424 --> 38:48.026
where in the world we were...

38:48.059 --> 38:50.729
as long as we were together.

I'm... I'm gonna tell
the rest of the team.

Clementine Lewis,

41:46.204 --> 41:48.774
sent me. I'm sorry, I don't...

41:48.807 --> 41:51.242
I know what I'm about to
say will sound impossible,

41:51.276 --> 41:54.846
um, but you were with Clem
three months ago in-in Colorado

41:54.880 --> 41:58.817
and, uh, she's pregnant.

41:58.850 --> 42:00.318

You don't understand.
You have the wrong guy.

42:06.892 --> 42:08.159
I'm in the Air Force

42:08.193 --> 42:09.571
and I was stationed over at
Ramstein, Germany

42:09.595 --> 42:11.563

42:11.597 --> 42:13.207
And if you're telling me
some girl is pregnant,

42:13.231 --> 42:15.867
then, I mean, that's amazing.

it's not because of me.
