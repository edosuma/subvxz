00:33.367 --> 00:34.500
I'm...

00:34.735 --> 00:36.368
making a film...

00:37.338 --> 00:39.571
about me...

00:40.374 --> 00:42.641
and my feelings for you.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.252
I'm still not over you.

00:52.253 --> 00:55.221
And I wanna figure out
why that is,

00:55.222 --> 00:57.322
and how it got to this point.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.325
But it's gonna be fun.

01:09.203 --> 01:12.337
<i>I'm Ann Lupo. I am a...</i>

01:13.641 --> 01:15.491
filmmaker.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.342
What do you hope
to find with us?

01:18.412 --> 01:20.179
I hope to find...

01:24.485 --> 01:27.086
that I can change.

01:30.424 --> 01:31.557
Yeah.

01:43.370 --> 01:45.504
<i>This was me three years ago.</i>

01:50.678 --> 01:52.644
<i>I was 23 years old...</i>

01:56.217 --> 01:59.152
<i>and most of the time,
I was lost in...</i>

01:59.153 --> 02:01.487
<i>one of many fantasies.</i>

02:06.260 --> 02:10.529
<i>And almost all of them
were about falling in love.</i>

02:19.607 --> 02:21.274
<i>There's this...</i>

02:21.275 --> 02:24.611
narrative, or maybe truth...

02:24.612 --> 02:25.845
it doesn't, I don't know,

02:25.846 --> 02:27.714
to be in love with someone,

02:27.715 --> 02:29.716
and for them
to be in love with you

02:29.717 --> 02:32.585
is one of
the holiest experiences

02:32.586 --> 02:34.654
you can have on this Earth.

02:34.655 --> 02:38.291
<i>♪ I'm so happy
That you found me ♪</i>

02:38.292 --> 02:40.827
<i>♪ And with your arms around me ♪</i>

02:40.828 --> 02:43.296
<i>♪ It's a happy wonderful world ♪</i>

02:43.297 --> 02:45.498
<i>The movies that have written</i>

02:45.499 --> 02:47.834
<i>people's mental paradigms
about love.</i>

02:47.835 --> 02:49.368
They are heightened.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.594
<i>And then if you believe</i>

02:53.595 --> 02:55.484
<i>that it's something
that you should be a part of,</i>

02:55.485 --> 02:57.374
because it seems like
a really fun thing.

03:06.287 --> 03:09.421
<i>I was just looking
to not be single anymore.</i>

03:11.425 --> 03:14.327
I wanted to have someone
to do all the things

03:14.328 --> 03:17.363
that people in couples do with.

03:17.364 --> 03:20.400
<i>But it didn't really matter
who that person was.</i>

03:20.401 --> 03:24.470
<i>I could practically fall in love
with anyone.</i>

04:13.420 --> 04:15.255
I love you.
I love you.

04:15.256 --> 04:17.357
I love you.
I love you.

04:17.358 --> 04:21.660
<i>So, yeah, I was pretty confused
about how love works.</i>

04:23.797 --> 04:27.332
<i>But you know, there's a lot
of misinformation out there.</i>

04:43.884 --> 04:44.951
Umm...

05:01.902 --> 05:05.071
<i>So, I worked
for this incredible couple.</i>

05:05.072 --> 05:08.508
<i>They run a business together,
making videos and commercials,</i>

05:08.509 --> 05:10.777
<i>and...
Now, they're engaged!</i>

05:10.778 --> 05:12.711
Oh, my god!

05:12.712 --> 05:14.645
Congratulations.
I can't believe it.

05:14.646 --> 05:16.582
My little sister's engaged.
Hey, Ann.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.250
Dude.

05:18.251 --> 05:19.919
Yes.
Incredible man.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.186
Aww.

05:21.187 --> 05:22.455
Was it incredible?

05:22.456 --> 05:23.956
Yes, Rachel.

05:23.957 --> 05:25.457
Oh, okay.
Right.

05:25.458 --> 05:26.959
How did you, uh,
pop the question?

05:26.960 --> 05:28.777
Oh, my god.
So, listen to this.

05:28.778 --> 05:30.596
I spent three months.
He created a scavenger hunt

05:30.597 --> 05:31.931
around the entire city.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.682
What?
Around all the places

05:33.683 --> 05:35.435
we've been to when we were
in a relationship,

05:35.436 --> 05:38.604
and he set up videos and little
riddles for me to solve.

05:38.605 --> 05:40.873
Guess it was perfect?

05:40.874 --> 05:42.875
Right?
Yes, yes, yes.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.242
The birds...

05:44.243 --> 05:45.611
...they were just like,
right on cue.

05:45.612 --> 05:47.580
Wow.
Just like...

05:50.617 --> 05:52.485
It was just so special.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.687
The trees were swaying like...

05:54.688 --> 05:55.888
...background dancers.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.356
Yeah.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.825
It was beautiful.
And then, there was like a...

05:58.826 --> 06:00.126
And then, and then, and then...

06:00.127 --> 06:02.511
Can you film us?

06:02.512 --> 06:04.897
And then, at the end
of that whole thing,

06:04.898 --> 06:07.282
I was waiting for her

06:07.283 --> 06:09.669
outside of 126 St. Mark's Place,
where we first met.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.353
Aww.

06:11.354 --> 06:13.039
And I got down on one knee...

06:13.040 --> 06:15.041
I wanna do it.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.775
Adrienne.
Mm-hmm?

06:17.911 --> 06:19.511
Will you marry me?

06:21.014 --> 06:22.115
And she said, "Yes."

06:23.600 --> 06:25.084
Aww, this is great.

06:25.085 --> 06:28.820
Love becomes marriage.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.458
Oh, okay.

06:32.459 --> 06:36.162
Marriage becomes vows.

06:36.163 --> 06:39.398
Vows last...

06:40.134 --> 06:41.800
a lifetime.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.672
Tears...

06:50.711 --> 06:51.943
forever...

06:53.080 --> 06:54.679
is...

06:55.816 --> 06:56.948
now.

07:00.154 --> 07:01.821
He expressed it.
Whoo.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.055
Wow.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.891
Hey, that was awesome.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.726
That was really good.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.127
Oh, yeah.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.196
Oh, I'm so proud of you guys.

07:10.197 --> 07:11.798
Congratulations, you two.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.634
Congratulations.

07:15.635 --> 07:17.435
Have a good day
writing poetry, dude.

07:22.443 --> 07:24.110
Are you serious?

07:24.111 --> 07:26.846
My videos get way more views
than yours.

07:26.847 --> 07:29.449
I think we
should take the day off.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.217
Oh, but we have about...

07:31.218 --> 07:34.120
that deck with the presentation
that's due on Friday.

07:34.121 --> 07:38.056
That deck. Are you telling me
we can't work on that deck...

07:39.893 --> 07:41.526
from bed?

07:42.729 --> 07:44.497
Oh.
Mm.

07:44.498 --> 07:47.200
Oh, you know I can work
on that deck

07:47.201 --> 07:49.869
from anywhere in the apartment.

07:51.205 --> 07:52.705
Oh, sorry. I can hear you.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.806
Oh, Ann.

07:54.807 --> 07:56.909
Um, you can hold down
the fort here, right?

07:56.910 --> 07:58.043
Yeah.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.547
Oh, god, what?

08:01.548 --> 08:03.081
It's nothing.

08:03.082 --> 08:04.617
It's nothing. Seriously...
What am I forgetting?

08:04.618 --> 08:07.253
We were... we were going to...

08:07.254 --> 08:09.155
Have our meeting today.
Yes, but...

08:09.156 --> 08:11.073
About the script.
It's fine.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.992
Okay, I read it last night
and it's actually pretty bad,

08:12.993 --> 08:14.415
so I don't...

08:14.416 --> 08:15.838
I don't wanna share with you.

08:15.839 --> 08:17.263
So no worries.
Ann. Ann, Ann, Ann.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.131
We don't have to do the meeting.

08:19.132 --> 08:21.234
I seriously wanna read
your script.

08:21.235 --> 08:24.237
And I will stay here
and I will do that today...

08:24.238 --> 08:26.905
because that's the kind
of boss I am.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.208
Thank you so much,

08:29.209 --> 08:31.511
but seriously, go. Have fun.

08:31.512 --> 08:32.845
Yeah.
Really?

08:32.846 --> 08:33.946
Yeah. Go.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.263
Okay.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.580
Hey, why don't you use
the studio for yourself today?

08:36.581 --> 08:37.897
Okay.
Use all the equipment.

08:37.898 --> 08:39.217
Use whatever you want.
Maybe I will.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.754
Bring your friends.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.756
Yeah, and tomorrow, I promise,

08:43.756 --> 08:46.125
we will resume
professional work but...

08:46.126 --> 08:48.094
...you know.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.520
Oh, download this card
Okay, bye.

08:49.521 --> 08:50.946
When you get a chance, please.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.372
Thanks.
Bye.

08:52.373 --> 08:53.798
Okay.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.977
<i>It's What's the Problem?
With your host,</i>

09:37.978 --> 09:41.581
<i>Andy Pincers!</i>

09:41.582 --> 09:43.816
Thank you for joining us.
I'm Andy Pincers.

09:43.817 --> 09:47.253
And welcome back yet again
to <i> What's the Problem?</i>

09:47.254 --> 09:48.704
Where we shame young women

09:48.705 --> 09:50.505
who are not living up
to their full potential.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.159
Let's say hello
to our contestants today.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.194
Ann Lupo!

09:57.096 --> 09:58.998
So, Ann, you've been on the show
quite a few times now.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.565
Is that right?

10:00.566 --> 10:02.134
Yeah, um, practically every day.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.235
So you know the drill.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.739
You want a relationship

10:06.740 --> 10:10.743
that is the most epic, cosmic,
white sizzling hot,

10:10.744 --> 10:14.347
bodice-ripping,
intellectually explosive,

10:14.348 --> 10:16.148
emotionally supportive,
yadda yadda yadda,

10:16.149 --> 10:18.184
love affair of our time.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.885
Is that right?
Uh-huh.

10:19.886 --> 10:21.954
But there's just
this one thing though.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.824
This guy. I don't see him.
He's not here so...

10:24.825 --> 10:26.892
what's the problem?

10:26.893 --> 10:28.327
Well, I think if I...

10:28.328 --> 10:30.296
Oh, Ann, I'm sorry.
That is incorrect.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.297
But I'll tell you
what the problem is.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.300
The problem
is that enormous nose.

10:37.371 --> 10:39.205
Those awkward chest hairs.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.908
And that,
coarse Sicilian mustache.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.545
Ooh,<i> brutas!</i>

10:46.546 --> 10:49.048
And on the other hand,
folks, help me out here.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.082
You're lazy!

10:50.083 --> 10:51.917
You're lazy!

10:51.918 --> 10:53.786
And you're probably
not even talented.

10:53.787 --> 10:56.155
Probably not even talented!

10:56.156 --> 10:58.658
Oh.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.226
I am just getting word

11:00.227 --> 11:02.811
that Ann believes

11:02.812 --> 11:05.398
that if she can acquire
all of these things,

11:05.399 --> 11:09.935
only then
will she be truly happy.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.207
Happiness.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.443
She wants to be happy!

11:19.680 --> 11:22.248
Which leads us
to our final round!

11:22.249 --> 11:26.085
The Underlying Problem!

11:26.086 --> 11:27.252
Now, Ann...

11:29.122 --> 11:31.289
do you believe that you...

11:33.226 --> 11:36.728
deserve all of this?

11:45.706 --> 11:48.891
That's correct!

11:48.892 --> 11:52.077
And that's your problem!

11:53.747 --> 11:55.381
Now get back to work.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.121
Hello?

12:03.122 --> 12:04.321
<i>Where are you?</i>

12:05.859 --> 12:07.727
Yeah, I'm...

12:07.728 --> 12:10.229
getting on the subway
as we speak.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.164
There was like a crazy delay

12:12.165 --> 12:14.100
and I have to get out
at the other subway.

12:20.774 --> 12:23.208
<i>Welcome to Wife Night.</i>

12:28.281 --> 12:32.017
<i>Okay, now, I will shout
it from the rooftops</i>

12:32.018 --> 12:34.887
that I love my IUD!

12:34.888 --> 12:37.923
Yeah, I got the one that goes
into your arm

12:37.924 --> 12:39.859
and I like...
I like never get my period.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.360
You never get it ever?

12:41.361 --> 12:42.861
Oh.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.130
Never.

12:54.474 --> 12:57.476
I started this book
on past-life regressions.

12:57.477 --> 13:00.246
It's super far out
but I love it.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.114
Is she speaking in tongues?

13:02.115 --> 13:04.550
There are voices
that speak through her

13:04.551 --> 13:08.220
about, like, energy fields
and higher dimensions.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.922
<i>This is Lallie.</i>

13:09.923 --> 13:15.327
<i>We've been best friends
since we were born.</i>

13:15.328 --> 13:17.996
Have you thought about
what you want for your birthday?

13:18.231 --> 13:19.799
No.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.933
Would you like me
to get you an IUD?

13:22.135 --> 13:23.268
No.

13:24.171 --> 13:26.205
Would you like me to get you...

13:26.206 --> 13:29.107
a Yoni Egg made of pure diamond.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.343
Yeah.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.479
Maybe Scott would like that.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.880
Scott?

13:34.881 --> 13:36.197
Like Scott "Scott"?

13:36.198 --> 13:37.514
Like, two months ago Scott?
Yeah.

13:37.515 --> 13:38.831
Are you guys still hooking up?
No. No, no, no.

13:38.832 --> 13:40.152
Are you...
Yes, but no.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.954
Dating?
No, no. We're just...

13:41.955 --> 13:44.222
enjoying each other's company.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.326
But I'm still
your primary partner, right?

13:49.596 --> 13:52.598
In all my past lives

13:52.599 --> 13:54.900
and all the lives
I have yet to live.

13:54.901 --> 13:58.136
I will never love anyone
more than you.

14:00.407 --> 14:02.875
Even if I come back as a turtle?

14:04.444 --> 14:07.879
I will bejewel your shell.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.082
Thank you.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.090
Ann you're up.

14:18.091 --> 14:19.390
Okay.

14:30.237 --> 14:31.369
Oh.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.274
The Nine of Swords.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.642
I know that card.

14:36.643 --> 14:39.111
That some sexy,
sword-wielding man

14:39.112 --> 14:42.381
about to storm into your life
and bang the shit out of you.

14:42.382 --> 14:45.451
Cool.
Like <i> Braveheart sex.</i>

14:45.452 --> 14:47.186
<i>Can I haveEnglish Patient sex?</i>

14:47.187 --> 14:48.520
Silence!

14:48.521 --> 14:50.321
Oh.

14:52.292 --> 14:56.161
This is a really serious card.

14:56.162 --> 15:01.033
You are going to go through
a total, spiritual upheaval,

15:01.034 --> 15:03.602
and you are gonna be
completely blindsided

15:03.603 --> 15:06.105
by the consequences
of your actions.

15:06.106 --> 15:10.375
Total obsession will drive you
to madness!

15:12.245 --> 15:13.678
Okay.

15:25.025 --> 15:27.042
Or...

15:27.043 --> 15:29.061
could also be
the sexy, sword-wielding man.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.330
No phones during
a tarot reading.

15:31.331 --> 15:32.665
Oh.
"Ms. Lupo,

15:32.666 --> 15:34.366
can I see you tonight?

15:34.367 --> 15:36.368
I'm still hard from last time."

15:36.369 --> 15:38.203
It doesn't say that.

15:38.204 --> 15:40.104
Might as well.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.005
Uh, is that who I think it is?

15:42.943 --> 15:45.310
When did that happen?

15:46.980 --> 15:49.281
We got back in touch.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.548
As in?

15:51.284 --> 15:54.386
We got back in... touch.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.155
Isn't he mean to you?

15:56.156 --> 15:57.389
No, he's hot.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.258
And I'm horny. Let me live.

15:59.259 --> 16:01.527
Ann, have fun.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.027
Be safe.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.130
Go fuck your brains out.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.048
Thank you.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.968
And maybe it's not
just sex this time you know.

16:08.969 --> 16:10.502
We keep coming back
to each other

16:10.503 --> 16:12.036
and I think,
there is something there.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.572
Okay.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.478
I know what I'm doing.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.784
When we start dating,

16:26.785 --> 16:29.154
it'll be purely for sexual
and intellectual fulfillment,

16:29.155 --> 16:31.222
and be totally unexclusive.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.560
Like if you wanna sleep
with anyone else

16:34.561 --> 16:36.595
or I wanna sleep
with anybody else.

16:36.596 --> 16:37.663
That's fine.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.264
No, no, no.

16:39.265 --> 16:40.665
Back this up.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.067
I don't wanna sleep
with anyone else.

16:42.068 --> 16:44.102
Yes, you do.

16:45.038 --> 16:47.006
I just sort of subscribe
to this theory

16:47.007 --> 16:51.076
that I can really have
whatever I want.

16:51.077 --> 16:54.012
Without any consequence,
you know.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.349
Uh...

16:58.350 --> 17:00.517
So I kind of started,
like, dating,

17:00.518 --> 17:02.688
<i>like not even, not dating,
just hooking up with people.</i>

17:02.689 --> 17:05.723
Ah!
<i>And that was like</i>

17:05.724 --> 17:08.761
<i>the normal thing to do
as a young person.</i>

17:08.762 --> 17:12.631
Yeah, just playing the parts
of people having sex

17:12.632 --> 17:14.366
that don't actually care
about each other.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.568
Finally, it was like,
"Oh, my god.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.368
Seriously, stop."

17:18.369 --> 17:20.172
Take a couple of months.
Don't think about boys.

17:20.173 --> 17:22.040
No, you are not allowed anymore.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.576
You need a time out.
And maybe that will cure you

17:24.577 --> 17:27.146
of whatever this is. Um...

17:35.789 --> 17:38.290
<i>And that's when it dawned on me.</i>

17:38.291 --> 17:43.162
<i>I am a strong, independent,
career-orientated woman,</i>

17:43.163 --> 17:47.466
<i>and the very,
very last thing I need</i>

17:47.467 --> 17:49.500
<i>is a fucking boyfriend.</i>

17:54.074 --> 17:57.743
<i>So, I had sworn off men.</i>

17:57.744 --> 18:00.345
<i>♪ Get out my way ♪</i>

18:00.346 --> 18:03.347
<i>♪ Just keep this shirt
'Less you got something to say ♪</i>

18:04.717 --> 18:07.486
<i>There was always that pressure,</i>

18:07.487 --> 18:10.354
<i>especially from Aunt Doreen.</i>

18:11.191 --> 18:12.758
Are you seeing anyone special?

18:12.759 --> 18:14.860
Did my mom put you up to this?

18:14.861 --> 18:17.563
We're just trying to help, okay?

18:17.564 --> 18:19.431
Have you tried any of the apps?

18:19.432 --> 18:21.300
No. Not my thing.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.268
What about joining a gym?

18:23.269 --> 18:25.804
I'm definitely not meeting
someone at the gym.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.539
Grad school?

18:27.540 --> 18:29.541
Oh.
Would you do church?

18:29.542 --> 18:31.659
No, okay.

18:31.660 --> 18:33.779
I don't even wanna be
in a relationship right now.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.215
You don't have one
of those "fuck buddies", do you?

18:36.216 --> 18:37.348
No.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.935
What? It's fine, okay?

18:40.936 --> 18:43.388
I don't need to be tied down
or committed to just one person

18:43.389 --> 18:46.691
because there's so much
of the world left to explore.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.494
And I'm really busy.

18:49.495 --> 18:51.429
That is such
a bunch of bullshit.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.471
Okay.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.173
If you must know...

19:01.174 --> 19:03.241
what I really want

19:03.610 --> 19:06.278
is to be in love.

19:06.279 --> 19:10.381
And to meet this person
in the most cosmic,

19:10.683 --> 19:13.418
fantastic way

19:13.419 --> 19:15.587
as if it were destiny.

19:15.588 --> 19:20.391
And I'm gonna love him,
and he is going to love me.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.760
And it's gonna be...

19:23.796 --> 19:25.296
perfect.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.265
Oh, Annie.

19:28.368 --> 19:29.801
No, Annie.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.603
Annie, no!

19:31.604 --> 19:32.737
What?

19:34.741 --> 19:36.542
What?
I have to tell you

19:36.543 --> 19:38.744
that man does not exist.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.312
And if you keep waiting
around for him,

19:40.313 --> 19:41.947
you're going to end up alone!

19:41.948 --> 19:44.332
And believe me,

19:44.333 --> 19:46.718
you do not want
to be alone at my age.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.720
I've seen things.

19:48.721 --> 19:49.955
Terrible things.

19:49.956 --> 19:52.357
These thoughts become habits.

19:52.358 --> 19:55.327
And the habits become your life.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.362
Annie, look at Jason.

19:57.363 --> 20:01.466
He thought he would find someone
by just waiting around.

20:01.467 --> 20:03.602
But he waited too long.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.737
And now he's 30.

20:05.738 --> 20:08.339
I mean, what are you
even doing here?

20:08.775 --> 20:09.908
We were gonna have lunch.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.877
No, Annie, honey.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.745
You have got to get out there!

20:13.746 --> 20:15.380
Oh, right now?

20:15.381 --> 20:16.615
Yup, yup, yup.

20:16.616 --> 20:17.716
I'm...
Let's go.

20:17.717 --> 20:18.817
I'm hungry.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.490
Have... Have you met John?

20:25.491 --> 20:26.925
No, who's John?

20:26.926 --> 20:29.228
My friend Carol's son John.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.929
Have I introduced you to him?

20:30.930 --> 20:31.997
No, I don't...
Oh, honey,

20:31.998 --> 20:33.615
you have to meet him.

20:33.616 --> 20:35.234
I mean, you two have so much

20:35.235 --> 20:37.018
in common like so much.

20:37.019 --> 20:38.804
I can't... I can't believe
I didn't think of this before.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.439
Oh, okay.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.874
He is a sweet boy.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.677
I mean, a genuinely good person.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.445
And his father's a playwright.

20:52.719 --> 20:53.501
Okay?

20:53.502 --> 20:54.284
I will... I will e-mail
introduce you tonight.

20:54.285 --> 20:55.067
Okay, but can you not
make it a date thing,

20:55.068 --> 20:57.428
because I'm really not trying
to think about boys right now.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.059
<i>So she set us up.</i>

21:01.060 --> 21:03.261
<i>I thought that
if I didn't dress up,</i>

21:03.262 --> 21:05.464
<i>and I had a reason to leave
shortly after he arrived,</i>

21:05.465 --> 21:08.934
<i>he would understand that
I was not interested in him.</i>

21:08.935 --> 21:11.603
<i>I was not trying to impress him.</i>

21:11.604 --> 21:14.273
<i>And I could meet a guy without
it having romantic connotations.</i>

21:14.274 --> 21:18.409
<i>And we could just be friends.</i>

21:19.579 --> 21:20.679
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

21:20.680 --> 21:21.813
Sorry I was late.

21:21.814 --> 21:24.382
Uh, were you waiting long?

21:25.285 --> 21:27.686
Oh, no.
I was in the neighborhood.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.654
What were you, uh, writing?

21:29.789 --> 21:31.289
Nothing.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.493
I sat across from him
and I was like,

21:34.494 --> 21:37.696
"Whoa, I have the potential
to be...

21:37.697 --> 21:39.431
incredibly attracted to you,

21:39.432 --> 21:41.566
but I am not gonna do that."

21:41.567 --> 21:43.669
I like the shirt.
It's very like...

21:43.670 --> 21:45.392
Marcel Marceau.
Oh.

21:45.393 --> 21:47.115
Thank you.
Yeah.

21:47.116 --> 21:48.840
That's exactly what
I was going for.

21:48.841 --> 21:50.542
I like yours, um...

21:50.543 --> 21:53.312
It's very Steve
from <i> Blue's Clues.</i>

21:53.313 --> 21:54.679
Wow.
I was just watching

21:54.680 --> 21:56.046
the first season.
Oh, great. That's great.

21:56.047 --> 21:57.416
Can I get you
something to drink?

21:57.417 --> 21:58.917
Yeah.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.785
Uh, what are you having?

22:01.888 --> 22:04.756
I could see that
we just got each other,

22:04.757 --> 22:07.592
and we could just go speeding
along in the conversation.

22:07.593 --> 22:09.860
What were you doing?
I was in Tibet.

22:10.363 --> 22:11.997
Wow.
Yeah.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.498
What... What's in Tibet?

22:13.499 --> 22:15.000
There's many things,
a lot of yaks.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.734
Tell me about your trip.

22:16.735 --> 22:18.470
Oh, it was... No.
It was really boring.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.405
I was just doing,
like, soul search.

22:20.406 --> 22:22.139
Straight up.
Um... Wow.

22:22.140 --> 22:23.875
Did you straight up
find this soul?

22:23.876 --> 22:26.111
Cheers. The soul was sought.

22:26.112 --> 22:28.046
Soul was not found.

22:28.047 --> 22:29.881
No.
Oh, no, but it's okay.

22:29.882 --> 22:31.483
We made progress.
Okay.

22:31.484 --> 22:33.584
You kind of know
where it might be?

22:34.554 --> 22:35.865
No.

22:35.866 --> 22:37.177
Maybe I should try Tibet.

22:37.178 --> 22:38.490
You should try Tibet, exactly.

22:38.491 --> 22:40.458
I may have seen your soul there.

22:41.627 --> 22:43.361
He seems really nice.

22:44.130 --> 22:49.134
And awkward and weird.
And I liked that.

22:49.135 --> 22:51.436
<i>The reoccurring
joke of the night</i>

22:51.437 --> 22:52.871
<i>was that we were
the same person.</i>

22:52.872 --> 22:55.473
Finishing
each other's sentences.

22:55.474 --> 22:58.075
"Oh, my god.
Do you think that way too?"

22:58.076 --> 23:00.679
I see time like we're all
on this track-and-field track.

23:00.680 --> 23:01.746
So we're like here-ish.

23:01.747 --> 23:02.814
Yeah. Right now.
Thank you.

23:04.308 --> 23:05.800
Yeah, we're here. Yeah, yeah.
Here, right? Here.

23:05.801 --> 23:07.293
This is it...
There. I'm with you.

23:07.294 --> 23:08.787
I'm on this track with you.

23:08.788 --> 23:09.855
Cool.
Yes.

23:09.856 --> 23:11.422
Cheers.

23:29.175 --> 23:30.975
Sorry about that.
Oh, it's okay.

23:30.976 --> 23:32.778
Oh, shit. Did you say you had
to be somewhere at 8:00?

23:32.779 --> 23:33.845
Yeah, what time is it?

23:33.846 --> 23:35.514
It's like 7:57.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.549
Oh, my god.

23:37.550 --> 23:39.184
I'm so sorry. I have to go.

23:39.185 --> 23:41.019
Oh, no, no, no. I got it.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.554
Oh, no.

23:42.555 --> 23:43.754
No, it's, uh...

23:43.755 --> 23:44.954
It's, uh...
It's okay.

23:47.427 --> 23:48.727
It was really great to meet you.

23:48.728 --> 23:50.095
Yeah. Great to meet you.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.629
See you.
Bye.

24:03.976 --> 24:06.912
<i>I left the bar
that night thinking,</i>

24:06.913 --> 24:10.815
<i>"Wow. What an amazing person."</i>

24:11.951 --> 24:13.485
I...

24:13.486 --> 24:15.503
probably won't see him
ever again.

24:15.504 --> 24:17.522
<i>Like an hour later,
I had an e-mail from him.</i>

24:17.523 --> 24:19.491
<i>"Hey, it was so nice
to meet you."</i>

24:19.492 --> 24:21.226
<i>Like blah-blah.
Things that you say.</i>

24:21.227 --> 24:23.978
And I was like, "Okay."

24:23.979 --> 24:26.731
<i>If you wanna see someone again,
you send that e-mail.</i>

24:26.732 --> 24:27.865
Right?

24:43.483 --> 24:44.749
Do you have something
that you would like

24:44.750 --> 24:45.983
to share with the class?

24:46.552 --> 24:47.685
No.

24:49.121 --> 24:50.255
Spit it out.

24:52.658 --> 24:55.627
Scott called me his girlfriend
the other day.

24:55.628 --> 24:57.028
What?

24:57.029 --> 25:00.165
Are you in love?

25:00.166 --> 25:02.701
I... think so.

25:02.702 --> 25:03.902
Oh, my god.

25:03.903 --> 25:06.972
What does it feel like?
Um...

25:06.973 --> 25:10.942
a warm pair of wooly socks.

25:10.943 --> 25:12.877
I don't know.

25:13.145 --> 25:14.645
Like, uh...

25:16.115 --> 25:18.250
carbonated brain.

25:18.251 --> 25:19.750
Like, uh...

25:20.253 --> 25:23.622
clear gust of mountain air.

25:23.623 --> 25:24.990
Like, uh...

25:24.991 --> 25:27.192
...cocoon of comfort.

25:27.193 --> 25:31.695
Like the peace of the calm seas.

25:35.033 --> 25:37.802
I'm so happy for you.

25:37.803 --> 25:39.704
Yeah.

25:39.705 --> 25:43.074
Oh, and also, I got confirmation

25:43.075 --> 25:48.046
that my piece will be featured
in a prestigious dance showcase.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.115
Yes! Yes! Yes!

25:50.116 --> 25:51.883
Yes!
That's incredible.

25:54.153 --> 25:56.921
Oh, my goodness.
Yes, so that's...

25:58.190 --> 26:00.158
Is that it? That's everything?

26:02.295 --> 26:03.795
Yeah.
Yeah.

26:03.796 --> 26:05.797
Thank you for sharing.
Yeah.

26:05.798 --> 26:06.931
That's all.

26:09.135 --> 26:12.603
So, you know that guy my aunt
set me up with the other day?

26:12.939 --> 26:14.706
Yes.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.942
Methinks he might be
a sweet boy.

26:16.943 --> 26:19.110
A sweet boy.

26:19.111 --> 26:21.913
The rarity of a sweet boy.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.214
Mm-hm.

26:23.215 --> 26:25.650
We'll see, though. We'll see.

26:25.651 --> 26:27.818
"We'll see"?
Mm-hm.

26:27.819 --> 26:29.986
Where that means
you like him, you like him!

26:39.665 --> 26:44.736
<i>So the second time
we hung out was a week later.</i>

26:44.737 --> 26:46.938
<i>He invited me
to his friend's house party.</i>

26:46.939 --> 26:49.307
<i>And the whole time,
I was making sure</i>

26:49.308 --> 26:52.677
<i>that my behavior
was in no way flirtatious,</i>

26:52.678 --> 26:55.145
<i>so that it would all have
to come from him.</i>

27:00.353 --> 27:01.820
Hello.

27:01.821 --> 27:03.153
Can I help you?

27:04.023 --> 27:05.656
What does it mean?

27:10.796 --> 27:11.997
<i>Oui?</i>

27:11.998 --> 27:13.831
<i>Oui.</i>
Mmm.

27:18.670 --> 27:20.271
<i>Time to go home now.</i>

27:20.272 --> 27:21.673
That's...

27:21.674 --> 27:23.208
...the responsible thing to do.

27:23.209 --> 27:25.076
I think I'm gonna go home,
actually.

27:25.077 --> 27:27.045
I have to be up early.

27:27.046 --> 27:29.179
Oh, yeah, totally. Me too.
Where are you headed?

27:29.849 --> 27:31.015
Uh, Bushwick.

27:31.016 --> 27:32.183
Me too. I'll go with you.

27:32.184 --> 27:35.019
So, we leave together.

27:37.056 --> 27:40.025
<i>I hadn't dressed for the cold,
but he had a jacket,</i>

27:40.026 --> 27:42.660
<i>so he gave it to me,
and like, zipped it up.</i>

27:44.897 --> 27:46.965
He's like, so nice.

27:56.825 --> 28:00.445
<i>Um... and then
we got on the subway.</i>

28:00.446 --> 28:03.448
<i>A pretty empty car,
rocking back and forth.</i>

28:03.449 --> 28:04.815
His face was right here,

28:04.816 --> 28:06.182
<i>and it was getting
really close to mine,</i>

28:06.183 --> 28:07.549
<i>and we were like
looking into each other's eyes.</i>

28:07.550 --> 28:08.920
Is this abnormal?

28:08.921 --> 28:11.822
<i>And then, he's like,
"Oh, I'll walk you home."</i>

28:32.011 --> 28:34.846
As we were rounding the corner,
talking to myself,

28:34.847 --> 28:36.414
<i>"What do you do
when you get to the door?"</i>

28:36.415 --> 28:38.383
<i>It was like you can't...</i>

28:38.384 --> 28:40.067
kiss him. No way.

28:40.068 --> 28:41.753
<i>You have to just hug him.</i>

28:41.754 --> 28:44.021
<i>So, we got to the door.</i>

28:44.022 --> 28:46.289
<i>"This was so much fun.
Thanks for walking me home."</i>

28:50.129 --> 28:53.130
<i>He just grabbed me
and kissed me.</i>

29:07.747 --> 29:09.214
<i>♪ I'm a fool ♪</i>

29:09.215 --> 29:11.149
It...

29:11.150 --> 29:15.520
lasted a while
before I responded to it.

29:15.521 --> 29:18.322
Holy shit, this is happening.
You like me.

29:19.024 --> 29:20.591
Yes!

29:20.592 --> 29:22.159
Party in my brain.

29:25.498 --> 29:28.032
And then, um...

29:28.033 --> 29:30.769
<i>♪ I wanna make this play ♪</i>

29:30.770 --> 29:33.304
<i>♪ Oh, I know you're fading ♪</i>

29:33.305 --> 29:35.440
<i>♪ Mmm, but stay ♪</i>

29:35.441 --> 29:37.509
And then, I was like...

29:37.510 --> 29:39.410
do you wanna come upstairs?

29:39.411 --> 29:41.312
<i>♪ I wanna make this play ♪</i>

29:41.313 --> 29:43.081
<i>♪ Oh, I know you're fading ♪</i>

29:43.082 --> 29:46.217
So, he came upstairs,
we started hooking up,

29:46.218 --> 29:48.352
but, it was...

29:49.889 --> 29:51.021
fun.

29:52.324 --> 29:54.224
He was cracking jokes.

29:55.561 --> 29:56.995
Whoa, okay.

29:56.996 --> 30:00.264
New animal to figure out here.

30:03.002 --> 30:05.937
<i>I suggested that we have sex.</i>

30:05.938 --> 30:08.573
So, we did.
How was it?

30:08.574 --> 30:10.073
It was good.

30:11.944 --> 30:16.113
<i>♪ Ooh, stay over ♪</i>

30:42.608 --> 30:44.908
<i>What if I...</i>

30:45.511 --> 30:47.244
felt like that?

30:48.514 --> 30:49.980
But...

30:50.516 --> 30:52.449
to him, this was...

30:53.519 --> 30:57.522
just like any other sex
he's ever had.

30:57.523 --> 30:59.090
And so, maybe...

30:59.091 --> 31:02.893
to him, I was just like a girl
that he slept with.

31:04.063 --> 31:07.899
<i>But at that moment,
there was not a doubt in my mind</i>

31:07.900 --> 31:10.868
<i>that we were starting
a relationship.</i>

31:11.871 --> 31:13.271
Oh, my god. He just texted me.

31:13.272 --> 31:14.939
What'd he say?

31:14.940 --> 31:16.374
"Hey, Loops. How are you?

31:16.375 --> 31:18.408
What are you up to
this weekend?"

31:20.045 --> 31:22.413
Hmm, "Loops."

31:22.414 --> 31:24.759
What should I say?

31:24.760 --> 31:27.105
You should say,

31:27.106 --> 31:29.466
"I want you to go down on me
for the rest of the afternoon."

31:38.430 --> 31:39.997
I got it.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.902
"Hey. Me and my friend
are hanging out today,

31:43.903 --> 31:45.336
but I'm free for the rest
of the weekend."

31:45.337 --> 31:47.572
That's so boring.

31:47.573 --> 31:50.308
And it should be
"My friend and I."

31:50.309 --> 31:54.045
Fuck. I already sent it.

31:54.046 --> 31:57.382
I think I know what
I wanna do for my birthday.

31:57.383 --> 31:58.449
Oh, yeah?

31:58.450 --> 32:00.350
I was thinking,

32:00.351 --> 32:02.253
since it's my last year
of my mid-20s,

32:02.254 --> 32:06.124
thought we could do like
a roaring 20s party.

32:06.125 --> 32:08.559
Yes! That's a brilliant idea.

32:08.560 --> 32:09.627
I'm brilliant.

32:09.628 --> 32:11.262
Can I invite John?

32:11.263 --> 32:14.131
As long as he has a costume.

32:15.968 --> 32:18.268
He's texting me.

32:18.504 --> 32:20.305
Thank you.

32:20.306 --> 32:21.472
Hey, asshole!

32:21.473 --> 32:23.974
Ow!

32:53.605 --> 32:57.140
Welcome to her
<i>Infinite Variety Show!</i>

32:59.377 --> 33:01.112
While working
in my lab like, late...

33:01.113 --> 33:04.649
While working in my lab
late one night,

33:04.650 --> 33:06.985
I accidentally became
a prima ballerina.

33:06.986 --> 33:08.353
The other day,

33:08.354 --> 33:10.871
I saw a man I liked,

33:10.872 --> 33:13.391
and I went right up to him
I did so, and I said,

33:13.392 --> 33:14.726
"I like you.

33:14.727 --> 33:17.996
I <i> really like you."</i>

33:17.997 --> 33:20.631
But he did not take so kindly
to my advances.

33:20.632 --> 33:22.767
Oh, my god.

33:22.768 --> 33:25.370
I'm sorry to disturb you.

33:25.371 --> 33:27.205
I love that voice.

33:27.206 --> 33:29.374
Thank you.
Keep up the good work.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.108
Thanks.
Okay.

33:35.214 --> 33:36.546
Good day.

33:41.387 --> 33:42.487
Jesus!
Hey!

33:42.488 --> 33:44.655
He is texting me. God!

33:44.656 --> 33:46.323
What the fuck?

33:56.168 --> 33:58.369
I need to be in an old city,

33:58.370 --> 34:03.074
with ruins, and great poets,
and witches, you know?

34:03.075 --> 34:04.307
Uh-huh.

34:16.155 --> 34:20.224
It's mainly mergers,
distress acquisitions.

34:20.225 --> 34:24.161
We may be a small company,
but, my guys are sharks.

34:24.163 --> 34:25.696
I bet.

34:25.697 --> 34:27.496
Excuse me.

34:38.610 --> 34:40.210
Oh, my god.

34:40.210 --> 34:41.813
Is it too much?
No, it's perfect.

34:41.813 --> 34:43.547
Hello.

34:43.549 --> 34:44.748
Welcome.

34:44.750 --> 34:47.385
Lallie, this is John.

34:47.386 --> 34:49.320
Wow, Lallie. I've never heard
that name before.

34:49.321 --> 34:51.755
Well, it's really Lauren...

34:51.757 --> 34:53.257
...but don't call me that.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.759
Okay, nice to meet you, Lallie.

34:54.760 --> 34:57.762
Happy birthday.
Oh, why thank you.

34:57.763 --> 34:59.230
Thank you.

34:59.231 --> 35:01.365
Scott, this is John.

35:01.366 --> 35:03.501
Hey, man.
Really nice to meet you.

35:03.502 --> 35:04.769
Nice to meet you.

35:04.770 --> 35:06.771
Hey, are you guys ready
to dance?

35:06.772 --> 35:08.238
Oh, yes.
Yes.

35:08.239 --> 35:09.707
Hey, everybody, everybody!

35:09.708 --> 35:11.476
Let's Charleston.

35:40.439 --> 35:43.307
Hmm, he s' mores with precision.

35:45.059 --> 35:46.811
I'm actually very good
at making s'mores,

35:46.812 --> 35:49.514
because when my parents
got divorced,

35:49.515 --> 35:51.582
my dad didn't know
what else to do with us,

35:51.583 --> 35:53.384
so he took us
on all these camping trips,

35:53.385 --> 35:56.220
to like, teach us how to be men
or something.

35:56.221 --> 35:57.320
Hmm.

35:57.321 --> 35:58.422
So...

35:58.423 --> 35:59.556
...great times.

36:00.425 --> 36:01.559
Impressive work.

36:03.162 --> 36:05.162
Yeah.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.165
In the same year,
I went through puberty,

36:07.166 --> 36:10.601
my parents got divorced,
and 9/11 happened.

36:10.602 --> 36:11.702
Oh...
So...

36:11.703 --> 36:13.236
That is rough.

36:13.572 --> 36:14.771
It's fine.

36:16.441 --> 36:17.941
Hmm.

36:17.942 --> 36:19.442
When my parents got divorced,

36:21.680 --> 36:23.313
it was like...

36:25.184 --> 36:26.517
Try it in a haiku.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.785
Ooh, amazing idea. Okay.

36:31.857 --> 36:34.425
There was an affair.

36:34.426 --> 36:35.726
Same.

36:35.727 --> 36:36.761
Really?
Yeah.

36:36.762 --> 36:38.296
Oh, my god.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.297
Hashtag same person.

36:40.933 --> 36:42.733
Finish the poem.
Oh, okay.

36:42.734 --> 36:44.235
Um...

36:44.236 --> 36:47.738
I played a lot
of internet Scrabble.

36:47.739 --> 36:49.606
Oh, no!

36:49.841 --> 36:51.542
That is so sad.

36:51.543 --> 36:52.944
Yeah, I did like a...
That is...

36:52.945 --> 36:55.746
Scrabble chat room
that I would do,

36:55.747 --> 36:57.748
instead of homework.
No.

36:57.749 --> 36:59.584
But yeah, it hit the spot.

36:59.585 --> 37:01.252
I bet it did.

37:01.253 --> 37:02.954
Okay.
Um...

37:02.955 --> 37:04.754
That's too many syllables. Okay.

37:05.591 --> 37:07.490
There was an affair.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.494
Internet Scrabble saved me.

37:10.495 --> 37:12.663
Oh, no.

37:12.664 --> 37:14.798
Everyone's fine now.

37:26.812 --> 37:28.345
Yes.

37:40.892 --> 37:42.760

37:44.545 --> 37:46.330
...how to avoid
fucking up my future children.

37:46.331 --> 37:47.798
Me, too.
Right?

37:47.799 --> 37:50.401
I'm like, we're living on a farm

37:50.402 --> 37:52.803

together as a family.

37:52.804 --> 37:54.805
Yes, a family.
Yes.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.574
No electronics.
No.

37:56.575 --> 37:57.808
Farm animals only.

37:57.809 --> 37:58.943
Yes.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.544

40:24.700 --> 40:26.724
<i>you've manifested
for yourselves.</i>

40:26.725 --> 40:32.596
<i>Oh, and here you are,
walking off into the sunset.</i>

40:32.597 --> 40:35.899
<i>Still crazy
after all these years.</i>

40:37.636 --> 40:40.738
<i>Future Memories!</i>

40:40.739 --> 40:44.141
Jumped on it, and it just
cracked completely through.

40:44.142 --> 40:45.842
It was really funny.

40:47.112 --> 40:50.581
Hey, so,
we haven't really talked.

40:50.582 --> 40:51.714
About what?

40:52.584 --> 40:54.785
About us.

40:54.786 --> 40:58.122
We've been hanging out
a lot, and...

40:58.123 --> 41:00.824
things got weird,
and stuff happened.

41:01.493 --> 41:04.228
I think you're so rad.

41:04.229 --> 41:06.130
We get along really well, so...

41:06.131 --> 41:08.865
I wanna keep hanging out
as friends.

41:09.734 --> 41:11.718
Oh.

41:11.719 --> 41:13.704
Yeah, I just wanted
to tell you now before...

41:13.705 --> 41:17.675
'Cause I never wanna
lead anyone on or anything.

41:17.676 --> 41:20.211
Yeah, I just kind of
felt like going in this...

41:20.212 --> 41:22.613
direction and I wanted to...

41:22.614 --> 41:24.747
...stop it
before things got weird.

41:30.188 --> 41:31.921
I'm sorry
to leave you like this,

41:31.922 --> 41:33.882
but I have to run
to this appointment in the city.

41:35.760 --> 41:37.061
Oh, yeah.

41:37.062 --> 41:39.163
That's fine. Um...

41:39.164 --> 41:41.831
Sorry, just to clarify,
you just wanna be friends?

41:43.034 --> 41:44.634
Yes.

41:46.771 --> 41:48.938
Yeah, we can be friends.

41:49.674 --> 41:50.975
Cool, okay.

41:50.976 --> 41:52.977
Yeah.
Cool.

41:52.978 --> 41:54.110
Uh...

41:57.516 --> 41:59.115
Bye.
Bye.

42:42.160 --> 42:45.329
I said to myself,
I can't be his friend,

42:45.330 --> 42:47.831
just given how strongly
I feel for him.

42:47.832 --> 42:50.935
If someone was giving me advice
right now, they would say,

42:50.936 --> 42:52.586
"Don't be friends
with this person,

42:52.587 --> 42:54.238
'cause it's gonna ultimately
hurt you a lot."

42:54.239 --> 42:56.040
Yeah.

42:56.041 --> 42:57.741
I can do that.

42:57.742 --> 42:58.875
That's easy.

43:05.050 --> 43:09.119
<i>It was the only
thing on my mind, ever...</i>

43:09.120 --> 43:11.354
<i>'cause I couldn't figure out
what happened,</i>

43:11.355 --> 43:13.591
<i>so I just kept replaying it
over and over,</i>

43:13.592 --> 43:15.192
<i>just thinking about
what I should have done,</i>

43:15.193 --> 43:16.893
<i>what I should have said.</i>

43:18.863 --> 43:20.698
I'm sorry to
leave you like this,

43:20.699 --> 43:23.700
but I have to run
to this appointment in the city.

43:25.270 --> 43:28.038
So, sorry, just to clarify,

43:28.039 --> 43:29.906
you just wanna be friends?

43:30.108 --> 43:31.608
Yes.

43:34.713 --> 43:36.879
Actually, I don't think
I could be friends with you.

43:38.984 --> 43:41.067
Oh.

43:41.068 --> 43:43.388
Yeah, I think it's best if
we don't see each other anymore.

43:44.055 --> 43:45.356
Okay.

43:45.357 --> 43:47.658
Damn, that's a... a bummer.

43:47.659 --> 43:49.743
Yeah, it fucking sucks.

43:49.744 --> 43:51.829
You think I wanna cut you out
of my life like a crazy person?

43:51.830 --> 43:54.298
No?
No, of course not.

43:54.299 --> 43:56.834
But I definitely
can't be friends with you

43:56.835 --> 43:59.202
because I'm fucking in love
with you.

44:00.138 --> 44:02.039
And you did lead me on.

44:02.040 --> 44:03.674
You kissed me.

44:03.675 --> 44:06.276
You had sex with me.

44:06.277 --> 44:08.878
You always text me,
and now you wanna be friends?

44:10.115 --> 44:11.781
Um, yeah.

44:17.122 --> 44:18.889
Ann, Ann.

44:18.890 --> 44:21.090
Ooh. Jumpy today.
Sorry.

44:21.960 --> 44:24.995
What's up?

44:24.996 --> 44:28.032
Okay. Umm, I'm not mad, but...
Oh, god.

44:28.033 --> 44:31.368
What you sent out last night
had a lot of mistakes.

44:31.369 --> 44:33.404
I'm sorry. I'll fix it.

44:33.405 --> 44:35.689
It's okay, I'm not mad,

44:35.690 --> 44:37.975
but on top of the mistakes,
it was...

44:37.976 --> 44:40.310
just really uninspired.

44:40.311 --> 44:42.446
You know, like, where's the...

44:42.447 --> 44:44.114
Where are you?

44:44.115 --> 44:45.782
I'm sorry,
I think I'm just really tired.

44:45.783 --> 44:47.451
Can I get you some Adderall?
Miguel.

44:47.452 --> 44:48.952
I'm just kidding.

44:48.953 --> 44:50.187
I'm fine, thank you.

44:50.188 --> 44:51.722
I'll just...

44:51.723 --> 44:53.039
I'm gonna fix it tonight.

44:53.040 --> 44:54.358
You know the drill, right?
Yeah.

44:54.359 --> 44:57.927
Serve up that
special sauce, you know.

44:58.329 --> 44:59.963
Fuck it up.

44:59.964 --> 45:01.098
Make it weird.

45:01.099 --> 45:03.233
Make them question everything.

45:03.234 --> 45:04.268
Yeah, okay.

45:04.269 --> 45:06.052
Sauce. Fucked up. Weird.

45:06.053 --> 45:07.838
Weird questions, all right?
Got it.

45:07.839 --> 45:09.628
That's what I like to hear.

45:09.629 --> 45:11.418
Got it. Okay.
All right.

45:11.419 --> 45:13.208
I will see you
on the flip side, Ann, and...

45:13.878 --> 45:15.333
Hmm?

45:15.334 --> 45:16.789
I'll see you at home, okay?
All right. Good luck.

45:16.790 --> 45:18.245
Call you right after.
Okay.

45:31.396 --> 45:32.929
Hi.

45:33.164 --> 45:34.731
Hi.

45:35.500 --> 45:37.166
What's the matter?

45:39.037 --> 45:42.739
It's really stupid.
I don't even wanna tell you.

45:43.508 --> 45:45.007
What's up?

45:47.795 --> 45:49.480
There's this guy...

45:49.481 --> 45:51.949
Oh, okay.

45:51.950 --> 45:54.885
So, I started talking about it,
and she was like,

45:54.886 --> 45:56.619
"That's...

45:56.620 --> 45:58.380
exactly what happened..."
With me and Miguel.

46:00.825 --> 46:01.892
What?

46:01.893 --> 46:03.025
Yeah.

46:04.796 --> 46:06.430
Well...

46:06.431 --> 46:08.114
<i>So, it was 2005,</i>

46:08.115 --> 46:09.800
<i>I just moved to the city
from this small town</i>

46:09.801 --> 46:12.046
<i>in Northern California.</i>

46:12.047 --> 46:14.292
<i>I was 22 and I didn't know
anyone in New York.</i>

46:14.293 --> 46:16.540
<i>So, I'm fresh off this bus,
waiting in the rain,</i>

46:16.541 --> 46:18.908
<i>when this random dude,</i>

46:18.909 --> 46:21.276
<i>and of course,
he totally forgot I was coming.</i>

46:24.883 --> 46:27.167
<i>And so, I met Miguel</i>

46:27.168 --> 46:29.453
<i>because I moved into
his apartment.</i>

46:29.454 --> 46:31.421
<i>And I remember when I met him,</i>

46:31.422 --> 46:33.557
<i>I thought he was
really handsome.</i>

46:33.558 --> 46:35.258
<i>He looked like a leading man.</i>

46:35.259 --> 46:36.959
All right, well,
welcome to New York.

46:39.330 --> 46:41.397
Oh.

46:41.398 --> 46:43.467
<i>And this is basically
like a one-bedroom apartment</i>

46:43.468 --> 46:45.290
<i>in the East Village,
that was turned</i>

46:45.291 --> 46:47.113
<i>into a two-bedroom,
and three dudes</i>

46:47.114 --> 46:48.939
<i>had been living there
before I moved in,</i>

46:48.940 --> 46:51.542
<i>so there was shit
all over the place.</i>

46:51.543 --> 46:54.877
<i>It was a mess,
but it didn't matter.</i>

46:55.847 --> 46:57.214
<i>Until I decided...</i>
How do you like it?

46:57.215 --> 46:59.032
<i>Yes.</i>

46:59.033 --> 47:00.850
<i>I definitely need to live here.</i>

47:10.228 --> 47:13.030
<i>We just, sort of became buddies,</i>

47:13.031 --> 47:16.934
<i>or partners,
operating in this little team.</i>

47:16.935 --> 47:18.968
<i>We just did everything together.</i>

47:20.171 --> 47:22.272
<i>We'd troll the East Village
every night.</i>

47:22.273 --> 47:24.374
<i>Drank and played pool.</i>

47:24.375 --> 47:25.975
<i>That's what we did.</i>

47:28.279 --> 47:30.447
<i>We would wait up
for each other late at night.</i>

47:30.448 --> 47:32.270
<i>If the other had to work,</i>

47:32.271 --> 47:34.093
<i>meet back up
at two in the morning,</i>

47:34.094 --> 47:35.919
<i>and talk for a little while.</i>

47:35.920 --> 47:39.156
<i>I mean, we literally
were comparing scars.</i>

47:39.157 --> 47:42.593
<i>After about maybe six months
into knowing him,</i>

47:42.594 --> 47:45.062
<i>I thought, "This is very clearly
what happens</i>

47:45.063 --> 47:47.714
<i>when two people
like each other."</i>

47:47.715 --> 47:50.367
<i>There's a force field around us
when we talk to each other.</i>

47:50.368 --> 47:53.070
<i>There's an electricity.</i>

47:53.071 --> 47:55.505
<i>So, I said something to him.</i>

47:55.506 --> 47:58.175
<i>"It seems like you like me.</i>

47:58.176 --> 48:01.578
<i>And I like you.
And maybe we should..."</i>

48:01.579 --> 48:02.646
<i>Dot, dot, dot.</i>

48:02.647 --> 48:05.415
I just don't, uh...

48:05.416 --> 48:06.984
I don't know
what to say to that.

48:06.985 --> 48:09.253
I mean, that's really cool.

48:09.254 --> 48:12.623
<i>And then,
I was really embarrassed.</i>

48:12.624 --> 48:14.257
<i>I, I thought,</i>

48:14.258 --> 48:15.893
<i>"Oh, my god.
I've completely misread</i>

48:15.894 --> 48:17.416
<i>this whole situation."</i>

48:17.417 --> 48:18.939
<i>And I normally don't do that.</i>

48:18.940 --> 48:20.464
<i>Like, I normally really trust
my judgement.</i>

48:20.465 --> 48:22.749
<i>So, I backed away.</i>

48:22.750 --> 48:25.035
<i>And said like,
"Okay. No problem."</i>

48:25.036 --> 48:27.203
<i>And immediately he was fine,</i>

48:27.204 --> 48:29.371
<i>and so I thought,
"Well, if he's fine."</i>

48:29.372 --> 48:31.541
<i>Then I'm fine, then we went
back to being friends.</i>

48:31.542 --> 48:32.609
<i>♪ Oh, yeah ♪</i>

48:36.981 --> 48:39.315
<i>♪ Where are you going? ♪</i>

48:39.651 --> 48:41.450
Audition.

48:43.454 --> 48:44.955
<i>♪ Where are you going? ♪</i>

48:48.960 --> 48:52.562
<i>But it just felt like
there was something amiss.</i>

48:52.563 --> 48:55.999
<i>Like, there's something
not quite right.</i>

48:56.000 --> 48:58.468
<i>And, after about
another six months,</i>

48:58.469 --> 49:00.887
<i>I said it again.</i>

49:00.888 --> 49:03.307
<i>"Not to be a weirdo nag,
or anything, but,</i>

49:03.308 --> 49:05.075
<i>I kinda feel like...</i>

49:05.076 --> 49:07.677
<i>We spend every night together,</i>

49:07.678 --> 49:10.279
<i>and I think maybe
we like each other."</i>

49:12.483 --> 49:14.784
<i>And it was the same thing again.</i>

49:14.785 --> 49:17.087
<i>He was like, "No. I don't...
Not, not like that,</i>

49:17.088 --> 49:19.055
<i>but you are my best friend."</i>

49:20.091 --> 49:21.491
<i>We probably had
this conversation</i>

49:21.492 --> 49:23.348
<i>about four or five times.</i>

49:23.349 --> 49:25.205
<i>The first time,
I was embarrassed.</i>

49:25.206 --> 49:27.064
<i>The second time,
I was like, "Really?"</i>

49:27.065 --> 49:28.999
<i>And then by third, I was like,</i>

49:29.000 --> 49:31.034
<i>"This is fucked up."</i>

49:31.035 --> 49:34.504
<i>This went on
for three and a half years.</i>

49:34.505 --> 49:36.328
<i>So, I finally decided to just</i>

49:36.329 --> 49:38.152
<i>get myself out
of this situation.</i>

49:38.153 --> 49:39.977
<i>Because at that point,
it was detrimental to me.</i>

49:39.978 --> 49:42.112
<i>So I said,
"I'm going to move out.</i>

49:42.113 --> 49:44.158
<i>And when I move out,</i>

49:44.159 --> 49:46.204
<i>I'm not gonna hang out
with you anymore.</i>

49:46.205 --> 49:48.251
<i>You make me feel bad
about myself.</i>

49:48.252 --> 49:52.222
<i>And it makes me feel like
I'm an unlovable person."</i>

49:52.223 --> 49:55.092
<i>And he was like,
"I can't bear to see you go."</i>

49:55.093 --> 49:57.227
<i>And I was like,
"I can't bear to go,</i>

49:57.228 --> 49:59.428
<i>but, I must."</i>

50:00.665 --> 50:02.398
<i>And then I moved out.</i>

50:05.570 --> 50:07.604
<i>About three weeks later,
he said,</i>

50:07.605 --> 50:09.039
<i>"Let's go get a drink."</i>

50:09.040 --> 50:11.452
<i>And I was like, "No,</i>

50:11.453 --> 50:13.865
<i>I don't wanna get
a drink with you."</i>

50:13.866 --> 50:16.279
<i>And he said,
"Please. Get a drink with me."</i>

50:16.280 --> 50:18.347
<i>"Okay, fine."</i>

50:18.348 --> 50:20.417
<i>So, we go to this bar
on the Lower East Side.</i>

50:20.418 --> 50:24.453
<i>I'm just on edge the whole time
like, prickly nervous.</i>

50:34.565 --> 50:39.169
<i>And then he tells me
that he's in love with me.</i>

50:39.170 --> 50:41.605
<i>And he has been, for a while.</i>

50:41.606 --> 50:43.562
<i>I was so floored,</i>

50:43.563 --> 50:45.519
<i>because that's exactly
what I wanted him to say,</i>

50:45.520 --> 50:47.477
<i>but I never thought
he'd actually ever</i>

50:47.478 --> 50:48.812
<i>actually say it.</i>

50:48.813 --> 50:50.781
<i>So, my first reaction was...</i>

50:50.782 --> 50:53.216
<i>"You fucker!</i>

50:53.217 --> 50:55.652
<i>Why did you make me
go through all that?"</i>

50:55.653 --> 51:00.257
<i>And we had this weird,
lengthy, heated conversation</i>

51:00.258 --> 51:03.593
<i>that I can't remember at all,
because I was in shock.</i>

51:03.594 --> 51:05.729
<i>I think we both kinda felt like,</i>

51:05.730 --> 51:07.329
<i>"This is it."</i>

51:09.067 --> 51:12.134
<i>And... We made it.</i>

51:16.441 --> 51:18.075
<i>Okay.</i>

51:18.076 --> 51:20.177
This is the same situation.

51:20.178 --> 51:23.146
He loves me and he just
doesn't know it, yet.

51:23.147 --> 51:24.681
We're just
gonna keep hanging out

51:24.682 --> 51:27.350
and, uh, he'll figure it out.

51:29.387 --> 51:31.354
All right.

51:31.355 --> 51:32.656
Don't forget to lock up.

51:32.657 --> 51:33.723
Okay, bye.

51:33.724 --> 51:35.224
Bye.

51:43.367 --> 51:45.668
Fuck! Fuck.

51:48.272 --> 51:49.538
Oh, my god.

51:54.445 --> 51:56.246
Hey, where are you?

51:56.247 --> 51:57.380
Hi.

51:57.381 --> 52:00.117
I am so sorry.

52:00.118 --> 52:02.185
<i>I, I just got completely</i>

52:02.186 --> 52:03.653
sucked into something at work.

52:03.654 --> 52:04.821
It's fine.

52:04.822 --> 52:06.556
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

52:06.557 --> 52:08.825
This is inexcusable.

52:08.826 --> 52:11.328
Um, how did it go?
How did it go?

52:11.329 --> 52:14.498
It was great.
Um, actually, I have to go.

52:14.499 --> 52:16.533
I'm just glad you're okay.

52:16.534 --> 52:17.733
Okay, well.

52:18.669 --> 52:20.403
I'm so sorry again.

52:20.404 --> 52:22.471
Bye.
<i>I'll talk to you soon.</i>

52:45.363 --> 52:46.897
<i>He loves me.</i>

52:46.898 --> 52:48.497
<i>He just doesn't know it, yet.</i>

52:52.904 --> 52:54.404
Hey!
Hey.

52:54.405 --> 52:55.906
How are you?
Good, how are you?

52:55.907 --> 52:57.807
What did you do today?
I just got back.

52:57.808 --> 53:00.025
I had to get out of this...

53:00.026 --> 53:02.245
Kind of a huge secret
I've never told anyone before.

53:02.246 --> 53:04.214
Okay, so, whisper it.

53:04.215 --> 53:06.583
I wanna try doing stand-up.

53:06.584 --> 53:08.785
Are you kidding?

53:08.786 --> 53:10.720
I have been writing a bit
in my head,

53:10.721 --> 53:12.322
for months.
Wait, can we like,

53:12.323 --> 53:14.191
actually do this?
Yes, okay.

53:14.192 --> 53:15.725
When are you free?
Let's plan it out right now.

53:15.726 --> 53:17.159
I think the 30th.

53:17.160 --> 53:18.595
<i>That is the perfect day.</i>

53:18.596 --> 53:19.863
...shoot.
You go.

53:19.864 --> 53:21.198
Fuck! Okay.

53:21.199 --> 53:22.899
Um...

53:22.900 --> 53:24.267
No, can you go first?

53:24.268 --> 53:25.801
No, you got this.

53:25.802 --> 53:27.337
Can we just watch
another stand-up special?

53:27.338 --> 53:29.005
No. Go!

53:29.006 --> 53:30.674
Okay.
I still can't believe

53:30.675 --> 53:32.992
we did that.
I know!

53:32.993 --> 53:35.312
It felt so good
to feel, like, nervous again

53:35.313 --> 53:36.513
and scared.
We are the coolest people

53:36.514 --> 53:37.747
I know.
We are.

53:37.748 --> 53:39.126
Okay, so,

53:39.127 --> 53:40.505
what are we gonna do next?

53:40.506 --> 53:41.885
Hmm.
I always wanted to do like,

53:41.886 --> 53:44.386
a modern,
expressionist dance class.

53:45.223 --> 53:47.656
Wait, I just took one,
last week.

53:47.825 --> 53:49.458
Weird.

54:13.384 --> 54:15.751
<i>I wanna keep hanging out
as friends.</i>

54:17.788 --> 54:21.391
<i>We never kissed again,
we never hooked up again.</i>

54:21.392 --> 54:25.761
<i>And things started to get
pretty fucked up in my head.</i>

54:32.536 --> 54:33.736
What?

54:35.406 --> 54:36.740
Nothing.

54:43.848 --> 54:45.915
So, uh...

54:45.916 --> 54:47.984
John asked me to do a project
with him, last night.

54:47.985 --> 54:52.922
Which I think
is a really good sign because...

54:52.923 --> 54:55.291
But then it's like,
"What does that mean?"

54:55.860 --> 54:57.310
Can I...
And then there was

54:57.311 --> 54:58.761
this other moment, I'm sorry.

54:58.762 --> 55:00.212
Okay.
There's this other moment

55:00.213 --> 55:01.665
last night, where his foot
was touching my leg,

55:01.666 --> 55:03.633
and he was seal flipper-ing me.

55:03.634 --> 55:06.436
Like just his foot
was just grazing my leg,

55:06.437 --> 55:08.638
and of course,
I wasn't gonna make a move,

55:08.639 --> 55:11.807
and neither was he.

55:11.808 --> 55:14.978
'Cause, I think he's scared
of his own feelings, you know?

55:14.979 --> 55:17.479
Why do you
still hang out with him?

55:19.016 --> 55:21.718
Because I like hanging out
with him.

55:21.719 --> 55:24.387
Don't you think
it's a little masochistic?

55:24.388 --> 55:27.857
No, I fully have accepted
and understand

55:27.858 --> 55:30.327
that he doesn't want to be
in a relationship right now.

55:30.328 --> 55:32.928
And that's fine,
because we're friends.

55:33.564 --> 55:34.964
For now.

55:34.965 --> 55:36.749
Mm.
And anyway,

55:36.750 --> 55:38.534
like you're always with Scott.
So, it's like.

55:47.578 --> 55:49.245
Where is everyone?

55:49.246 --> 55:50.914
They said it was too far
to come into Manhattan.

55:50.915 --> 55:52.716
Ha!

55:52.717 --> 55:53.883
So, Ann.

55:53.884 --> 55:55.518
What's up with you?

55:55.519 --> 55:57.754
I'm starting
a project with John.

55:59.623 --> 56:01.757
He has this idea

56:01.758 --> 56:03.892
and, um, I thought it was cool,
so I said yes.

56:04.495 --> 56:05.895
Wait.

56:05.896 --> 56:07.897
You're still hanging out
with John?

56:07.898 --> 56:09.099
Thank you.

56:09.100 --> 56:10.900
Yeah.
Ann.

56:10.901 --> 56:13.168
Baby girl.

56:13.169 --> 56:15.438
No, no, no. I don't think
this is a good idea.

56:15.439 --> 56:16.873
Why not?

56:16.874 --> 56:19.442
Because you still like him.

56:19.443 --> 56:21.744
Yeah, but it's not
like that, we're just...

56:22.747 --> 56:24.948
working on a project together.
Ann.

56:24.949 --> 56:26.448
Ann.

56:27.051 --> 56:28.650
Think about it.

56:47.138 --> 56:49.873
Good evening, I'm Andy Pincers,
and welcome back

56:49.874 --> 56:52.475
to <i> What's The Problem?</i>

56:52.476 --> 56:54.944
Tonight, we bring you
some exclusive interviews

56:54.945 --> 56:57.413
with some very special guests.

56:57.882 --> 57:00.483
So, Lallie, tell us.

57:00.484 --> 57:03.019
What is Ann's problem?

57:03.020 --> 57:04.888
Andy, we've been over this.

57:04.889 --> 57:07.690
It's that she's
repulsively naive.

57:07.691 --> 57:10.426
Repulsive.

57:13.164 --> 57:15.565
Penis?

57:15.566 --> 57:17.767
I don't believe you.
No, seriously.

57:17.768 --> 57:22.939
I don't ever, truly,
honestly never watched porn.

57:22.940 --> 57:24.706
I don't.
Wait, so.

57:25.209 --> 57:28.444
Truly, honestly,
how do you like?

57:28.979 --> 57:31.864
Um...

57:31.865 --> 57:34.750
I kind of just think about like,
what it's like to be in love.

57:37.655 --> 57:39.722
Oh. Interesting.

57:39.723 --> 57:40.989
Goddamn it, Ann.

57:42.026 --> 57:44.160
Yeah. Um...

57:44.161 --> 57:47.864
Tiffany, what do you think
the problem is?

57:47.865 --> 57:50.133
She pours out all of her power
to fill him up.

57:50.134 --> 57:51.801
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

57:51.802 --> 57:53.470
Would you mind
doing me a huge favor?

57:53.471 --> 57:55.171
Yeah, anything. What's up?

57:56.774 --> 57:58.007
It's irresponsible.

57:58.008 --> 57:59.075
Hm.

58:08.152 --> 58:10.119
Oh, hey. Actually I, um...

58:10.120 --> 58:11.921
I have to go let my roommate in.

58:11.922 --> 58:13.130
Oh.
Um...

58:13.131 --> 58:14.339
Okay.
Yeah, but I'll see you...

58:14.340 --> 58:15.548
Yeah, I'll be back.
Yeah. Okay.

58:15.549 --> 58:16.757
Cool, see you.
Bye.

58:20.498 --> 58:22.665
What do you think
the problem is?

58:22.666 --> 58:24.167
She's completely, Mm-hmm.

58:24.168 --> 58:25.502
And totally,
ANDY: Mm-hmm.

58:25.503 --> 58:27.170
Deluded.
Mm.

58:27.171 --> 58:30.240
My brain had
just stopped working.

58:30.241 --> 58:31.941
<i>Okay. So, I only have access...</i>

58:33.526 --> 58:35.109
<i>...I told you
to do that everyday.</i>

58:51.629 --> 58:54.530
I'm sorry, honey,
but you're emotionally bankrupt.

59:01.205 --> 59:03.722
All you have to do is say,

59:03.723 --> 59:06.242
"If you don't want to be with me
then it's your loss."

59:06.243 --> 59:08.944
You can do so much better.

59:08.945 --> 59:11.648
Yeah, you deserve someone
who actually cares about you.

59:11.649 --> 59:13.048
You know what?

59:15.185 --> 59:16.852
Call him.
Mm.

59:17.021 --> 59:18.888
No.

59:18.889 --> 59:20.990
Right now.

59:25.195 --> 59:26.879
Ann.

59:26.880 --> 59:28.564
Come on, go.
Okay.

59:28.832 --> 59:30.165
Oh, my...

59:53.824 --> 59:56.025
<i>Hiya, Loops.
How's it going?</i>

59:56.026 --> 59:57.594
Hey, how are you?

59:57.595 --> 59:59.640
<i>I'm good, I'm good.</i>

59:59.641 --> 01:00:01.686
<i>I'm just packing up
for that trip in the Galápagos.</i>

01:00:01.687 --> 01:00:03.733
<i>There's all these last minute
thing to do, um...</i>

01:00:03.734 --> 01:00:05.368
No.
<i>What's up with you?</i>

01:00:05.369 --> 01:00:07.736
Um. Not too much.

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:11.523
<i>Okay.</i>
Okay.

01:00:11.524 --> 01:00:13.309
Um, awkward conversation
approaching.

01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:15.060
<i>Oh, great. I love those.</i>

01:00:15.061 --> 01:00:16.813
You ready?
<i>Yup.</i>

01:00:16.814 --> 01:00:18.214
Okay.

01:00:18.215 --> 01:00:20.917
Do you know
that I still like you?

01:00:20.918 --> 01:00:24.921
Like, is that within
your awareness?

01:00:24.922 --> 01:00:27.072
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

01:00:27.073 --> 01:00:29.223
<i>Yeah, sometimes
I am aware of it.</i>

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.060
We, we hang out so much,

01:00:32.061 --> 01:00:33.963
and sometimes the things
that you say,

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:35.932
and like the stuff
that we do together,

01:00:35.933 --> 01:00:37.734
just makes me think...

01:00:37.735 --> 01:00:39.168
...that you like me.

01:00:39.169 --> 01:00:42.705
And I'm just
really confused, so...

01:00:42.706 --> 01:00:45.775
I wanted to talk to you
about that.

01:00:45.776 --> 01:00:49.379
<i>Well, I really like
hanging out with you,</i>

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:53.416
<i>and we have
so much fun together.</i>

01:00:53.417 --> 01:00:55.701
<i>I just like being your friend,</i>

01:00:55.702 --> 01:00:57.987
<i>because you're so cool
and you're so rad.</i>

01:00:57.988 --> 01:00:59.855
Uh, not helping.

01:01:00.057 --> 01:01:01.189
Um...

01:01:02.226 --> 01:01:04.192
Okay, how about this?

01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:10.133
I need you to just say out loud,

01:01:10.134 --> 01:01:12.669
that you don't like me that way.

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:16.739
Or else, I won't believe you.

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:18.974
<i>Do you want me to say that?</i>

01:01:20.244 --> 01:01:22.045
Yeah.

01:01:22.046 --> 01:01:23.979
<i>Okay, um...</i>

01:01:24.348 --> 01:01:26.148
<i>Ann, I don't...</i>

01:01:26.784 --> 01:01:29.235
<i>like you that way.</i>

01:01:29.236 --> 01:01:31.688
<i>I don't share
the same feelings that you do.</i>

01:01:31.689 --> 01:01:34.756
<i>But I really like you
as a friend.</i>

01:01:35.159 --> 01:01:36.291
Okay.

01:01:38.829 --> 01:01:40.730
<i>Okay.</i>
I don't that we should

01:01:40.731 --> 01:01:42.876
hang out any more.

01:01:42.877 --> 01:01:45.022
<i>No, we don't have to do this.</i>

01:01:45.023 --> 01:01:47.170
<i>It'll be such a bummer.</i>

01:01:47.171 --> 01:01:48.805
Yeah, you've said that before.

01:01:48.806 --> 01:01:50.807
<i>Well, I mean it.</i>

01:01:50.808 --> 01:01:52.524
Okay.
<i>Look, can we just talk</i>

01:01:52.525 --> 01:01:54.243
Um, I have to go.
<i>About this, when I get back.</i>

01:01:54.244 --> 01:01:55.694
<i>Ann?</i>

01:01:55.695 --> 01:01:57.146
<i>Are you there?</i>
Okay.

01:01:57.147 --> 01:01:59.247
<i>Ann?</i>
Bye.

01:02:17.434 --> 01:02:18.917
John.

01:02:18.918 --> 01:02:20.403
It's so great to have you
on the show.

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:22.171
Thank you so much again,
for joining us.

01:02:22.172 --> 01:02:23.339
Thank you for having me.

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:25.140
Cameras are off.
Oh?

01:02:26.343 --> 01:02:27.876
Come on, you can tell me.

01:02:28.312 --> 01:02:31.113
What was the problem?

01:02:34.752 --> 01:02:37.353
Well, what it really
came down to was...

01:02:37.354 --> 01:02:39.388
I just wasn't attracted to her.

01:02:39.389 --> 01:02:40.889
Bah!

01:02:43.527 --> 01:02:45.428
Now, that's a problem.

01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:49.465
Um, and then there was
the nose, of course.

01:02:49.466 --> 01:02:51.100
Terrible, the worst.

01:02:51.101 --> 01:02:52.490
She was so clingy,

01:02:52.491 --> 01:02:53.880
she just wasn't someone
I wanna start

01:02:53.881 --> 01:02:55.271
a relationship with.
No, no, no.

01:02:55.272 --> 01:02:56.371
You don't need that.

01:02:56.372 --> 01:02:57.473
I just wish she would stop.

01:02:57.474 --> 01:02:59.791
Let me tell you.

01:02:59.792 --> 01:03:02.111
She's on my show every day,
and I hate her.

01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:04.012
Mm.

01:03:04.013 --> 01:03:05.915
I know you got more.

01:03:05.916 --> 01:03:08.151
And then, uh...

01:03:14.792 --> 01:03:16.793
It just doesn't make any sense.

01:03:16.794 --> 01:03:19.328
I feel like he's just lying
to himself.

01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:22.330
What?
Ann.

01:03:23.834 --> 01:03:24.934
Wake up.

01:03:24.935 --> 01:03:27.937
It has been an entire year.

01:03:27.938 --> 01:03:30.940
And it never even came close
to a relationship.

01:03:30.941 --> 01:03:33.242
And since, okay,
no one else will tell you,

01:03:33.243 --> 01:03:36.945
you're being crazy,
like actually out of your mind.

01:03:38.348 --> 01:03:39.949
Well, maybe if you weren't

01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:41.161
hanging out with Scott
all the time,

01:03:41.162 --> 01:03:42.373
you'd have
a better understanding

01:03:42.374 --> 01:03:43.586
of how much pain
I'm in right now.

01:03:43.587 --> 01:03:45.304
Listen to yourself!

01:03:45.305 --> 01:03:47.023
I'm telling you
that I'm having a hard time,

01:03:47.024 --> 01:03:49.025
and you're just abandoning me.
There is more to life

01:03:49.026 --> 01:03:51.861
than stupid boys,
and stupid love, Ann.

01:03:51.862 --> 01:03:53.995
Have you even read
the news lately?

01:03:56.233 --> 01:04:01.938
I don't hang out with you
because you suck to be around.

01:04:01.939 --> 01:04:04.373
You suck my energy.

01:04:04.374 --> 01:04:06.241
I'm just this pot,

01:04:06.242 --> 01:04:08.110
that you dump
all your emotional shit into.

01:04:08.111 --> 01:04:09.545
And I'm sick of it!

01:04:09.546 --> 01:04:11.346

It's good to see you.
Right.

I know.

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:49.197
I was in Frankfurt.

01:07:49.766 --> 01:07:52.201
Ah, yes. Frankfurt.

01:07:52.202 --> 01:07:55.170
So, what was in Frankfurt?

01:07:56.273 --> 01:07:57.472
Work.

01:07:58.375 --> 01:08:00.342

LA.

01:08:10.754 --> 01:08:12.220
Work.

01:08:31.808 --> 01:08:33.374

01:12:10.794 --> 01:12:13.329
my mind.

01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:14.896
So, they don't define me.

01:16:00.957 --> 01:16:02.156
How you doing?

01:16:03.226 --> 01:16:04.959
I'm okay.

01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:19.140
I'm sorry I've sucked lately.

01:16:22.579 --> 01:16:24.712
I'm sorry I was mean.

01:16:27.884 --> 01:16:30.686
I was never really happy
for you and Scott.

01:16:30.687 --> 01:16:32.186
I know.

01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:37.592
I judged you hard
on the whole John thing.

01:16:40.763 --> 01:16:42.631
Are we even?

01:16:42.632 --> 01:16:44.800
We don't have to keep score.

01:16:44.801 --> 01:16:45.933
Hmm.

01:16:49.939 --> 01:16:51.205
How is Scott?

01:16:54.277 --> 01:16:56.878
We broke up.

01:16:56.879 --> 01:16:59.046
What? When?

01:16:59.949 --> 01:17:02.116
Same day we were mean.

01:17:04.954 --> 01:17:06.088
Ah...

01:17:06.089 --> 01:17:07.956
What happened?

01:17:09.875 --> 01:17:11.792
He just said he wanted
to be free.

01:17:14.831 --> 01:17:16.832
And you can't argue
with that, right?

01:17:20.069 --> 01:17:21.702
I'm sorry.

01:17:34.784 --> 01:17:37.319
Well, being
that I am the only certified

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:38.787
wedding planner in the room.

01:17:38.788 --> 01:17:40.322
I think...

01:17:40.323 --> 01:17:42.424
Look at this face, that's joy

01:17:42.425 --> 01:17:44.292
from being able to dance
to good music.

01:17:44.293 --> 01:17:45.794
Okay, we need...
Knock, knock.

01:17:45.795 --> 01:17:47.696
Hey, how are you?
Hi, Miguel.

01:17:47.697 --> 01:17:49.347
How are you?
Dude, I haven't seen you

01:17:49.348 --> 01:17:50.999
in forever, how's it going?
Hi.

01:17:53.024 --> 01:17:55.047
Hi.
Hello.

01:17:55.048 --> 01:17:57.072
Oh, Ann, maybe you can help us
end this debate.

01:17:57.073 --> 01:17:58.973
Ann, what's more important?

01:17:59.275 --> 01:18:00.941
A great band.

01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:02.778
Or...

01:18:02.779 --> 01:18:06.348
Gold calligraphy
on weighted card stock.

01:18:08.033 --> 01:18:09.718
Look at it, it's beautiful.

01:18:09.719 --> 01:18:11.787
Well, that is
also really beautiful.

01:18:11.788 --> 01:18:13.221
And inviting.
Yeah.

01:18:13.222 --> 01:18:14.690
And it doesn't look like a bill.

01:18:14.691 --> 01:18:16.357
No.
It looks like something

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:18.026
special for you.
Yeah, but...

01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:19.161
Your decision.

01:18:19.162 --> 01:18:21.897
Thank you. And you know,

01:18:21.898 --> 01:18:24.232
you and I can take
calligraphy classes

01:18:24.233 --> 01:18:25.744
and we can do this ourselves.

01:18:25.745 --> 01:18:27.256
I love that.
Yeah.

01:18:27.257 --> 01:18:28.770
I support and encourage
that hobby.

01:18:28.771 --> 01:18:30.205
I might join you on that.

01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:31.831
Let me know.
Ann.

01:18:31.832 --> 01:18:33.457
All right.
What do we need,

01:18:33.458 --> 01:18:35.083
what are we talking about?

01:18:35.084 --> 01:18:36.709
It's pretty. We can.
It will look good.

01:18:38.314 --> 01:18:39.848
All right, what's up?

01:18:39.849 --> 01:18:41.249
Okay.

01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:43.185
I'm ready to start
my project now.

01:18:43.186 --> 01:18:45.353
Ooh, did you send me the script?

01:18:45.354 --> 01:18:48.190
Nope. This is a brand-new idea.

01:18:48.191 --> 01:18:49.824
It doesn't have a script yet.

01:18:50.359 --> 01:18:52.728
Cool.
Yeah.

01:18:52.729 --> 01:18:53.994
So, how can I help?

01:18:57.366 --> 01:18:59.200
I need you to interview me.

01:19:09.746 --> 01:19:11.279
There we go.

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:12.380
It's too far?
Yeah.

01:19:12.381 --> 01:19:13.949
Okay.

01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:15.249
All right, um...

01:19:15.752 --> 01:19:17.152
<i>I'm...</i>

01:19:17.153 --> 01:19:18.853
making a film...

01:19:19.455 --> 01:19:22.022
about me...

01:19:22.425 --> 01:19:25.092
and my feelings for you.

01:19:27.063 --> 01:19:29.831
And how, even though
it's been a year,

01:19:29.832 --> 01:19:33.067
and you've been
very clear with me,

01:19:33.336 --> 01:19:34.902
your feelings,

01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:36.905
I'm still not over you.

01:19:36.906 --> 01:19:40.442
And I wanna figure out
why that is, and,

01:19:40.443 --> 01:19:42.444
and how I got to this point.

01:19:42.445 --> 01:19:44.395
So.

01:19:44.396 --> 01:19:46.348
I don't know what form
it's gonna take, yet.

01:19:46.349 --> 01:19:48.316
But I just wanted
to let you know.

01:19:48.317 --> 01:19:50.384
Before I got too far
along with it.

01:19:51.354 --> 01:19:53.321
Oh, huh.

01:19:53.322 --> 01:19:56.324
Thank you for letting me know.

01:19:56.325 --> 01:19:58.826
But it's gonna be fun,

01:19:58.827 --> 01:20:01.329
it's gonna be very much
a self-investigation.

01:20:01.330 --> 01:20:02.963
Yeah, well...

01:20:10.072 --> 01:20:11.338
I'm sorry that...

01:20:12.108 --> 01:20:13.274
It's okay.

01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:17.345
I get it, I think.

01:20:17.346 --> 01:20:19.947
Or at least,
I hopefully will soon.

01:20:26.122 --> 01:20:27.354
Are you okay?

01:20:29.025 --> 01:20:30.224
Yeah.

01:20:32.061 --> 01:20:33.194
Okay.

01:22:25.675 --> 01:22:27.575
You look lovely, darling.

01:22:27.576 --> 01:22:30.077
Well, as do you...

01:22:32.315 --> 01:22:33.480
my lady.

01:22:36.018 --> 01:22:37.686
Couple Miguel...

01:22:37.687 --> 01:22:39.620
And Adrienne.

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:41.556
My bosses, who I love so much.

01:22:41.557 --> 01:22:44.225
Oh, ladies.
I wanna fuck you both!

01:22:45.377 --> 01:22:46.528
How dare you
MAN: Whoa!

01:22:46.529 --> 01:22:47.945
Disrespect us like that!

01:22:47.946 --> 01:22:49.364
Yeah, shame on you!
Oh, you're crazy.

01:22:49.365 --> 01:22:50.999
We will castrate you!

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.567
You better run!

01:23:01.010 --> 01:23:02.910
In all my past lives,

01:23:02.911 --> 01:23:04.811
and the lives
that I have yet to live,

01:23:04.812 --> 01:23:06.715
I will never love anyone
as much as I love you.

01:23:06.716 --> 01:23:08.984
Even if I come back as a goat?

01:23:08.985 --> 01:23:11.486
Especially if you come back
as a goat.

01:23:11.487 --> 01:23:12.754
I will braid your beard.

01:23:12.755 --> 01:23:15.256
Oh, why thank you.

01:23:17.093 --> 01:23:18.209
No.

01:23:18.210 --> 01:23:19.327
That's it, right?

I vow to be your colleague.

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:53.595
Your champion.
Your confidant.

01:23:53.596 --> 01:23:56.297
Your goofball.
And your queen.

01:23:56.298 --> 01:23:58.199
Through thick and thin.

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.435
Through good times and bad.

01:24:00.436 --> 01:24:02.704
For richer or for poorer.

01:24:02.705 --> 01:24:04.472
As long as we both shall live.

01:24:04.473 --> 01:24:06.340
As long as we both shall live.

01:24:17.586 --> 01:24:20.822
As many of you know,
I was, uh...

01:24:20.823 --> 01:24:23.324
jilted.

01:24:24.427 --> 01:24:27.395
Uh.

01:24:27.396 --> 01:24:30.365
It happens, and I'm sure
you might think I may be a bit

01:24:30.366 --> 01:24:32.199
triggered by this...

01:24:32.568 --> 01:24:34.068
situation.

01:24:34.370 --> 01:24:35.669
Celebration.

01:24:37.339 --> 01:24:39.173
Two trees.

01:24:39.608 --> 01:24:41.508
Planted next to each other.

01:24:42.711 --> 01:24:47.482
Growth, through life.

01:24:47.483 --> 01:24:52.286
Cells dividing,
expanding, creating more.

01:24:54.824 --> 01:24:56.356
Consciousness.

01:24:57.827 --> 01:24:59.526
Adrienne...

01:25:00.362 --> 01:25:02.196
you never needed

01:25:02.531 --> 01:25:04.565
anyone to complete you.

01:25:06.669 --> 01:25:08.136
And Miguel,

01:25:08.137 --> 01:25:10.671
you make her more complete.

01:25:11.807 --> 01:25:13.775
You know, I wish I knew
what that felt like.

01:25:15.311 --> 01:25:16.778
Well, she did hook up with...

01:25:16.779 --> 01:25:18.412
Two trees.

01:25:19.115 --> 01:25:20.647
Planted next to each other.

01:25:23.252 --> 01:25:24.385
Cheers.

01:25:24.386 --> 01:25:25.420
Cheers.

01:25:25.421 --> 01:25:27.122
Love you, Rach.

01:25:27.123 --> 01:25:29.156
You are the trees.

01:25:29.658 --> 01:25:31.459
Cheers.

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:33.261
