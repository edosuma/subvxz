10:39.239 --> 10:41.006
- Man, you can't do that stuff.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.707
You'll only find pain.

10:42.709 --> 10:44.843
When my ex-wife got
into my email account,

10:44.845 --> 10:45.844
She was devastated.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.812
- Too late.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.848
I found out she's been texting
a guy named pete.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.917
Does anybody know a pete?

10:56.022 --> 10:57.822
- Pete.
- Hmm.

10:57.824 --> 11:01.760
- It just occurred to me that
andy has been calling me plop

11:01.762 --> 11:04.929
For so long
he forgot my real name.

11:04.931 --> 11:06.431
Which is pete.

11:32.058 --> 11:33.058
- Hello.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.426
- Hey.
There she is.

11:34.428 --> 11:36.027
- [chuckles]

11:36.029 --> 11:38.163
- How you doing?
- Hi.

11:38.165 --> 11:39.798
Hey, do I look okay?

11:39.800 --> 11:40.832
- You look great.
- Okay.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.802
- Yeah.
- What's that?

11:43.804 --> 11:46.905
Where you're going with this,
and this is who I am now.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.240
But look what I can do
with my hands.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.109
- [giggles]
- gotta go.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.744
Vip just walked
through the door.

11:52.746 --> 11:55.046
- How are you, isaac?
You have something in your ear.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.082
- It's a phone.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.718
- Yes, it is,
and thank you so much

11:59.720 --> 12:01.052

this opportunity.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.487

12:09.830 --> 12:12.897
Or are you saying that to me?
- Call you right back.

12:12.899 --> 12:13.798
What were you saying?

12:13.800 --> 12:15.366
- Ha-ha.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.235

12:28.815 --> 12:30.882

12:30.884 --> 12:35.887

12:41.528 --> 12:44.095

All right.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.999
Let's get her out to the yard
so you can spray her down.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.534

12:49.536 --> 12:51.870
- No, it's a lot better
than it sounds.

12:51.872 --> 12:54.873
There's a private shower area,

12:54.875 --> 12:57.375

and very rustic.

really weird news, and, uh,

13:15.562 --> 13:17.896

13:17.898 --> 13:19.931

13:19.933 --> 13:25.837

ch-lamydia from erin.

13:25.839 --> 13:28.206

20:58.958 --> 21:00.992
But I've actually
been commissioned

21:00.994 --> 21:03.494
By the city of scranton
to paint a mural--

21:03.496 --> 21:07.331
- What does this say here?
[speaking gibberish]

21:07.333 --> 21:08.799
What language is this?

21:08.801 --> 21:10.868
Swahili?
Oh, wait a second.

21:10.870 --> 21:13.738
Now I can read it.
- Oh, 'cause it was upside-down.

21:13.740 --> 21:16.741
- You're a good audience.

21:16.743 --> 21:20.378
Unlike some of these people
around here.

21:20.380 --> 21:23.314
- Yeah.
The city commissioned me to do--

21:23.316 --> 21:25.549
- Yeah, we don't have a lot of
call for doodling around here.

21:25.551 --> 21:28.819
But I like this resume,
and here's why.

21:28.821 --> 21:31.555
It shows that you
stick around.

21:33.492 --> 21:36.360
Yeah,
you don't jump ship easily

21:36.362 --> 21:39.430
Like a lot of these people.
[sighs]

21:39.432 --> 21:42.566
I mean, they--they worship me,
you know,

21:42.568 --> 21:46.671
But do they like me?

21:46.673 --> 21:51.342
I mean, do you think
they like me, pam?

21:53.545 --> 21:55.646
- Yes.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.015

21:58.017 --> 22:00.584

But you gotta move on.

23:11.557 --> 23:13.457
Thank you.
You can leave now.

23:13.459 --> 23:14.692
- Listen to him, andy.

23:14.694 --> 23:15.760
He's trying
to tell you something

23:15.762 --> 23:18.662
That you really need to hear.

23:18.664 --> 23:21.766
- Awesome perspective.
Thanks for butting in.

23:21.768 --> 23:24.869
- Well, I've been
where you are now.

23:24.871 --> 23:26.103
I dated this girl alice,

23:26.105 --> 23:27.938
And it was an ugly break-up.

23:27.940 --> 23:31.142
She worked at a marketing agency
right next to my house.

23:31.144 --> 23:33.043
I'd run into her every day,
but I had to grow up

23:33.045 --> 23:35.579
And deal with it,
and I did.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.581
We're even
facebook friends now.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.750
- See?
We can all be friends.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.719
- Yeah.
- Just get over it.

23:41.721 --> 23:43.554
It doesn't have to be awkward.

23:43.556 --> 23:45.656
- I do think we can have
a fair...[voice fading]

23:45.658 --> 23:47.491
Andy: Yeah, so life
gives you lemons,

23:47.493 --> 23:50.661
You just gotta eat 'em,
rinds and all.

23:50.663 --> 23:53.431
Your ex-girlfriend
will shove them down your throat

23:53.433 --> 23:55.199
With the help
of her hunky new boyfriend.

23:55.201 --> 23:57.601
So that's fun.

24:35.644 --> 24:37.877
- Nothing to see here.

24:37.879 --> 24:40.747
Boss at work.

24:40.749 --> 24:43.116
This will be your desk,

24:50.759 --> 24:53.960
Are you?
I'm not allowed to ask, so...

24:53.962 --> 24:56.329
- I am not--
- you're not pregnant.

24:56.331 --> 24:58.131
I didn't ask her
if she was pregnant.

24:58.133 --> 24:59.432
She just offered it.

24:59.434 --> 25:03.236
The last three girls here
all got pregnant.

25:03.238 --> 25:05.304
- Wow.
- Don't--don't be afraid.

25:05.306 --> 25:07.173
It's a different chair.

25:07.175 --> 25:09.142
I don't want a guy up here.

25:09.144 --> 25:14.180
I want to, you know, see a woman
come in and do a great job.

25:14.182 --> 25:16.182
Something--I have to look out
this window--

25:16.184 --> 25:18.284
- I'm sorry, I thought this job
was for the position

25:18.286 --> 25:19.352
Of office manager.

25:19.354 --> 25:21.087
- It is.
Yeah.

25:21.089 --> 25:23.256
You'd manage this office.

25:23.258 --> 25:25.792
You'd answer the phone
and forward the calls,

25:25.794 --> 25:28.728
And, you know, go
for a coffee run now and again.

25:28.730 --> 25:30.830
- So kind
of like a receptionist.

25:30.832 --> 25:33.332
- Yeah.
Like a receptionist,

25:33.334 --> 25:36.402
But we call you
the office manager,

25:36.404 --> 25:41.107
Because it's less demeaning.

25:41.109 --> 25:44.811
By the way,
how long are these cameras

25:44.813 --> 25:46.279
Gonna be following you around?

this is pretty cool.

Do you like that show?
- Yes.

25:57.158 --> 26:00.426
- Well, I think they indulge
themselves a little too much.

[inhales]

26:02.864 --> 26:04.163
I like scripted.

26:04.165 --> 26:07.133
I spent ten years
as a receptionist

26:07.135 --> 26:08.434
To michael scott.

26:08.436 --> 26:12.872
And I have kids now.

26:12.874 --> 26:16.876
And I just--
I can't.

26:19.279 --> 26:21.848
- Ow.
The braid is too tight.

26:21.850 --> 26:23.449
- Oh, hush.

26:23.451 --> 26:26.285
Loose braids reflect
a loose character.

26:26.287 --> 26:28.755
Now stay still.

26:28.757 --> 26:30.757
- Yes, ma'am.

26:30.759 --> 26:33.993
- I think your hair is much too
long for your age, by the way.

26:33.995 --> 26:36.162
- Okay.

26:36.164 --> 26:39.298
- There.

26:39.300 --> 26:41.400
- Thank you, angela.

26:42.436 --> 26:44.804
- I'm going to the prison

26:44.806 --> 26:47.507
This afternoon
to go and talk to the strangler.

26:47.509 --> 26:51.177
- Probably best to use his
real name rather than strangler.

26:51.179 --> 26:54.280
- Don't use his real name.

26:54.282 --> 26:56.149
George howard skub?

26:56.151 --> 26:58.284
That's a devil name.

26:58.286 --> 27:01.320
- Anyway, I just wanted to say
I'm doing it.

27:01.322 --> 27:04.223
I'm going.

27:04.225 --> 27:06.392
- He's doing it.

27:13.968 --> 27:15.401

Wait until I tell you.

27:15.403 --> 27:17.537
This guy was unbelievable.

27:17.539 --> 27:19.205
Okay, so--
- I can't wait

27:19.207 --> 27:20.973
To hear about it later.

27:20.975 --> 27:22.909
Do you want to come in at 8:00?
And don't eat,

27:22.911 --> 27:23.910
Because I'm ordering in.

27:23.912 --> 27:25.378
- 8:00?
Really?

27:25.380 --> 27:27.380

I promise.

right away.

27:49.871 --> 27:51.437
So I will take you
to your desk.

28:25.340 --> 28:28.341
Okay.
We dated for two years.

28:28.343 --> 28:29.876
- That's so random.

28:29.878 --> 28:32.578
- Well, is it?

28:32.580 --> 28:37.016
- Andy also hired
a management consultant today.

Oh, no.

28:47.628 --> 28:49.161

28:53.401 --> 28:55.401

I am not going in there

With expectations, per se.

29:18.192 --> 29:21.060
I will meet
george howard skub.

29:21.062 --> 29:24.964
I will tell him that I believe
he is innocent.

29:24.966 --> 29:28.401
I would understand if he
felt motivated to hug me.

29:28.403 --> 29:31.170
I would understand
if a friendship began.

How did bogart put it?

29:33.141 --> 29:35.107

this is the start

Of my first friendship.

29:40.348 --> 29:43.716
- He worked as a librarian
freshman year.

- Was he, like,
the sexy librarian?

29:48.089 --> 29:49.388
Who's in charge
of marketing?

29:49.390 --> 29:53.259
Maybe I should sit
near him or her.

- Hi.
How's it going?

29:56.030 --> 29:58.097
- Hi.
Good.

29:58.099 --> 30:00.299
- I'd love to discuss strategy
with you

30:00.301 --> 30:02.535
If you have a marketing--
- wow, this sure is intense.

with someone

30:05.740 --> 30:08.007
You used to get it on with.

30:08.009 --> 30:10.109
- Andy, that is
really inappropriate.

30:10.111 --> 30:12.578
- Awkward!
- It is awkward.

30:12.580 --> 30:16.115
This is a really uncomfortable
situation that you've contrived.

30:16.117 --> 30:19.051
- Really uncomfortable
situation.

30:19.053 --> 30:21.620
- Yeah.

30:21.622 --> 30:23.422
- That's all right, pete.
You can handle it.

30:23.424 --> 30:25.992
I mean, we all
just gotta move on.

30:25.994 --> 30:27.727
Ain't that right,
professor lecture-much?

30:27.729 --> 30:30.162
Uh, question.

30:30.164 --> 30:32.131
How's that medicine taste?

30:32.133 --> 30:34.400

30:34.402 --> 30:37.103
Is it just me,
or have these tables turned?

30:39.406 --> 30:42.675
Hmm.
Hmm.

30:47.781 --> 30:50.049
- So there's
no marketing department?

30:50.051 --> 30:52.151
Both: No.

30:52.153 --> 30:53.519
- You know,
times were tough.

I was unemployed.

30:54.756 --> 30:56.655

over you.

But as you can see I put
all that weight right back on.

31:04.065 --> 31:06.632
Yeah.
It's crazy.

It's like a warm pumpkin.

- So andy just called you up
out of the blue?

31:11.172 --> 31:13.706
- Yeah.
He told me you two broke up.

31:15.108 --> 31:17.710
You must be pretty horny.

31:21.681 --> 31:24.150
- Well, the good news is,
no more guilty conscience.

31:24.152 --> 31:26.485
At least you know
he is the strangler.

31:26.487 --> 31:28.521
The proof is in the grip.

31:28.523 --> 31:34.226
Did they say when
the vocal cords would heal?

31:34.228 --> 31:37.730
One week?
Okay.

31:37.732 --> 31:41.133
Two weeks?

31:41.135 --> 31:43.202
Okay.

31:43.204 --> 31:47.139
You offered your neck
in search of the truth.

31:47.141 --> 31:49.475
The proud neck of justice--
isn't that the expression?

31:49.477 --> 31:52.411
Well, anyway,
it was--it was very brave.

31:56.750 --> 31:59.118
It really was quite brave.

32:02.689 --> 32:05.124
- I feel like a show pony.

32:05.126 --> 32:07.326
- And you look like one too.
Thank you, angela.

32:07.328 --> 32:09.395
- You're welcome.
Would you like some stew?

32:09.397 --> 32:14.433
- By all means. And I will carve
the roast skunk.

32:14.435 --> 32:16.802
Angela.
- Mm-hmm?

32:16.804 --> 32:18.871
- Would you like
the stink sack?

32:18.873 --> 32:20.773
- Is it any good?
- No.

32:20.775 --> 32:23.175
You don't eat it.
It's a toy, like a wishbone.

32:23.177 --> 32:24.777
You know, prettiest girl
gets the stink sack.

32:24.779 --> 32:26.445
- Thank you.

32:26.447 --> 32:30.483
- So when's the wedding?

32:30.485 --> 32:31.884
- Um...

32:31.886 --> 32:34.854
Actually, we are just friends.

32:34.856 --> 32:37.590
- That's what mose said
about his lady scarecrow,

32:37.592 --> 32:40.392
And look what he did
to that poor thing.

32:40.394 --> 32:42.128
- Hello?

32:42.130 --> 32:43.696
- Hey.
Back here.

32:43.698 --> 32:47.600
- [laughs]

32:47.602 --> 32:50.402
Wow.
Seriously?

32:50.404 --> 32:51.770
Oh, my gosh.

32:51.772 --> 32:53.439
Is that champagne?
- <i>Si, señor.</i>

32:53.441 --> 32:54.840
[pop]

32:54.842 --> 32:58.544
- Oh, jim, I should have
told you I didn't get the job.

32:58.546 --> 33:01.147
- Oh, man.
I'm so sorry.

33:01.149 --> 33:02.548
Are you all right?
- Oh, yeah.

33:02.550 --> 33:03.649
I'm more than all right.

33:03.651 --> 33:04.783
There's just nothing
to celebrate?

33:04.785 --> 33:05.784
- Are you kidding?

33:05.786 --> 33:06.852
You're in philly.

33:06.854 --> 33:10.222
And this is
just consolation champagne.

33:10.224 --> 33:13.459
That immediately gave up
to the nazis.

33:13.461 --> 33:14.693
- [chuckles]
- here.

33:14.695 --> 33:16.762
- You're very quick
on your feet.

33:16.764 --> 33:17.830
I remember you.

33:17.832 --> 33:19.798
Funny.

33:19.800 --> 33:23.869
- All right, so tell me
all about it.

33:25.739 --> 33:28.307
- Okay, well...

33:28.309 --> 33:30.876
Gosh, thank you
for your help today.

33:30.878 --> 33:33.479
Your perspective
was very useful.

33:33.481 --> 33:34.647
Thank you.

33:34.649 --> 33:36.549
- It was not an unpleasant way

33:36.551 --> 33:40.352
To spend an afternoon.

33:49.729 --> 33:52.264
Dwight, dwight.
- Right.

33:52.266 --> 33:54.300
Not outside.
The horseflies.

33:54.302 --> 33:56.535
You know what, my farm is
only a few acres east of here.

33:56.537 --> 33:59.905
Or we could use
the slaughterhouse.

33:59.907 --> 34:02.408
- No, dwight,
the senator.

34:02.410 --> 34:06.378
- Leave him. He probably won't
even notice that you're gone.

34:06.380 --> 34:07.980
Be with me, monkey.

34:07.982 --> 34:11.317
- I can't be
your monkey, dwight.

34:11.319 --> 34:14.420
- I'm not talking
about some frisky romp

34:14.422 --> 34:18.591
We have wasted too much
of our lives ignoring the fact

34:18.592 --> 34:22.328
That we belong together.

34:22.330 --> 34:26.232
The 80 or 90 years that I
have left of this life...

34:26.234 --> 34:28.467
I want to spend with you.

34:30.337 --> 34:31.904
- I made a vow.

34:31.906 --> 34:33.806
I gave my word.

34:33.808 --> 34:37.409
- Stand by your man.

34:41.248 --> 34:44.783
It's what I would want
if you were mine.

34:44.784 --> 34:46.851
- Good night, d.

34:53.560 --> 34:54.860
- How are you doing?

34:54.862 --> 34:57.796
Is it really rough?
- It is so unpleasant.

34:57.798 --> 34:59.732
You?
- Hey, love turds.

34:59.734 --> 35:02.401
Conference room now.

35:05.605 --> 35:07.573
Thank you all for coming in.

35:07.575 --> 35:09.441
Just wanted to check in.

35:09.443 --> 35:12.344
How was everyone's day?

35:12.346 --> 35:16.348
- Honestly,
it was a little weird.

35:16.350 --> 35:19.618
- Really?
Hmm.

35:19.620 --> 35:22.888
That's interesting,
because erin and pete

35:22.890 --> 35:25.024
Thought it wouldn't be weird
at all.

35:25.026 --> 35:26.759
Why do you think
it was weird, gabe?

35:26.761 --> 35:29.461
Maybe because you and erin
used to be an item?

35:30.430 --> 35:32.431
- I still wear
erin's button-downs

35:32.433 --> 35:33.899
Around the condo sometimes,

35:33.901 --> 35:36.302
So it feels to me like we're
still in a relationship...

35:36.304 --> 35:37.836
- Gabe.
- A lot of the time.

35:37.838 --> 35:39.972
- Ugh.

35:39.974 --> 35:41.974
- And, alice, I understand

35:41.976 --> 35:45.444
You once dumped pete.
Ouch.

35:45.446 --> 35:46.745
- It was an amicable break-up,
andy.

35:46.747 --> 35:48.747
- Okay,
while we're rewriting history,

35:48.749 --> 35:50.683
You never had
a drinking problem.

35:50.685 --> 35:51.950
- It was college.

35:51.952 --> 35:53.619
That is what you do.

35:53.621 --> 35:55.354
- Dude, you're also supposed
to go to classes,

35:55.356 --> 35:58.791
- Hey, andy, is this
at all work-related?

35:58.793 --> 36:00.059
- We'll get to that.

36:00.061 --> 36:02.061
Gabe, did erin ever tell you

36:02.063 --> 36:06.598
- [laughs] no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.467
She wouldn't even
let me say it.

36:08.469 --> 36:10.402
It was adorable.
She'd plug her ears

36:10.404 --> 36:12.738
- Gabe,
can you stop talking?

36:12.740 --> 36:14.440
Because every word
out of your mouth

36:14.442 --> 36:16.008
Is like the squawk
of an ugly pelican.

36:16.010 --> 36:18.510
- I got a tattoo for you.

36:18.512 --> 36:21.046
- I didn't ask you
to get that nike swoosh.

36:21.048 --> 36:22.514
Nobody did.
You did that for you.

36:22.516 --> 36:24.450
- Just do it.

36:24.452 --> 36:27.486
You were the it
that I was just doing.

36:27.488 --> 36:28.787
- So you're dating
a secretary now?

36:28.789 --> 36:30.389
Moving up in the world,
pete.

36:30.391 --> 36:32.825
- She's nice to me.

36:32.827 --> 36:34.760
- How's that p.E. Degree
coming?

36:34.762 --> 36:37.429
His dream in college
was to be a gym teacher.

36:37.431 --> 36:38.731
- Well, guess what,

36:38.733 --> 36:39.998
He could still be a gym teacher.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.600
In fact, we could all
still be gym teachers.

36:41.602 --> 36:43.669
So let's--
- I technically cannot.

36:43.671 --> 36:45.537
I don't have the lung capacity
to blow a whistle.

36:45.539 --> 36:47.539
- Oh, my god.

36:49.476 --> 36:51.076
What kind of music
are you into, peter?

36:51.078 --> 36:54.012
- Uh, I like
all kinds of music, gabe.

36:54.014 --> 36:56.415
- Really?
All kinds?

36:56.417 --> 36:59.618
Written by the white knights
of ku klux klan?

36:59.620 --> 37:01.053
Erin, are you even hearing this?
- No!

37:01.055 --> 37:02.721
- Gabe, he didn't even
say that.

37:02.723 --> 37:03.889
- He's not
a very sophisticated man.

37:03.891 --> 37:05.591
I mean,
he can't use chopsticks,

37:05.593 --> 37:06.792
So do I need
to say anything else?

37:06.794 --> 37:10.396
- [laughs]
erin, I've been to japan.

37:10.398 --> 37:12.097
I know how to use chopsticks
so well.

37:12.099 --> 37:14.600
Come back.

37:14.602 --> 37:16.435
One night.
Give me one night with you.

37:16.437 --> 37:17.936
- What is that supposed to be?
- I have shaved everything.

37:17.938 --> 37:19.104
- I don't want you to shave--

37:19.106 --> 37:20.906
- I wasted two years
of my life on you.

37:20.908 --> 37:22.708
You realize that, right?
- I just want to be real clear

37:22.710 --> 37:24.977
That chopsticks
is not the measure of a man.

37:24.979 --> 37:27.613
- I am as smooth
as a porpoise for you.

37:27.615 --> 37:28.714
- Why didn't you say
at the beginning,

37:28.716 --> 37:29.782
"this isn't really going
that well"?

37:29.784 --> 37:31.784
- Shovel his sashimi
into his mouth

37:31.786 --> 37:33.452
As a sport.

37:33.454 --> 37:34.787
Andy: All right,
all right, yes,

37:34.789 --> 37:36.455
That is a legitimate question.

37:36.457 --> 37:38.424
Does making erin and pete
feel bad

37:38.426 --> 37:41.093
Make me feel better?

37:41.095 --> 37:42.928
Yeah.

37:42.930 --> 37:46.465
Yeah. It does.

37:46.467 --> 37:49.034
- So imagine, like,
the real estate version

37:49.036 --> 37:51.203
Of michael scott,
and that was this guy.

37:51.205 --> 37:53.439
He did half the interview
as ace ventura.

37:53.441 --> 37:55.140
- Tell me about the cologne.
How much?

37:55.142 --> 37:57.443
- Oh.
An entire bottle at least.

37:57.445 --> 37:59.077
- You're definitely
hoarding this, by the way.

37:59.079 --> 38:02.114
- Guess--guess what poster
he had on his wall?

38:02.116 --> 38:04.516
- <i>Austin powers.</i>
<i>- Mm-mm.</i>

38:04.518 --> 38:05.884
- <i>Ferris bueller.</i>
<i>- Mm-mm.</i>

38:05.886 --> 38:07.553
You're getting colder.

38:07.555 --> 38:09.188
- Not <i>night at the roxbury.</i>

38:09.190 --> 38:11.557
- No.

38:11.559 --> 38:14.460
<i>The odd life</i>
<i>of timothy green.</i>

38:14.462 --> 38:17.229
- I'm sorry. How did you think
I was expected to guess that?

38:17.231 --> 38:19.198
- I don't know.
But it's interesting, right?

38:19.200 --> 38:21.667
- It's fascinating.
- He said he can't help

38:21.669 --> 38:23.869
But tear up when he looks at it,
and it's right next to his desk.

38:23.871 --> 38:25.871
He must look at it,
like, 20 times a day.

38:25.873 --> 38:27.806
- That's amazing.

38:27.808 --> 38:29.141
Well, listen,
you can't win 'em all, right?

38:29.143 --> 38:31.243
- Mm-hmm.
- So the next interview

38:31.245 --> 38:33.846
Has to be better.

38:33.848 --> 38:35.180
- I don't know.

38:35.182 --> 38:36.782
- What do you mean?

38:36.784 --> 38:39.184
Of course it will.
You're amazing.

38:40.787 --> 38:42.554
- I know.
It's just, even if it was

38:42.556 --> 38:44.089
A great boss
and a great job,

38:44.091 --> 38:46.225
I just--I don't--
I don't know if I--

38:46.227 --> 38:49.928
If I want to--
I don't know if I want this.

38:55.668 --> 38:57.202
- Huh.

39:01.107 --> 39:03.742
This is a little
out of left field.

39:03.744 --> 39:05.611
- Is it?

39:10.183 --> 39:14.286
I just--
I liked our life in scranton.

39:16.689 --> 39:21.126
- And I have started a business
in philadelphia.

39:33.907 --> 39:35.974
- Little
did my grandfather know,

39:35.976 --> 39:38.877
Mahjong would be here
to stay.

39:38.879 --> 39:42.648
- <i>Hobbies of the east</i>
<i>continues in a moment.</i>

39:45.785 --> 39:47.853
- [clears throat]

39:47.855 --> 39:49.988
You could all be doing this.

39:49.990 --> 39:51.623
Just saying.

39:51.625 --> 39:52.958
I watch way too many ads online,

39:52.960 --> 39:54.760
And I don't do enough sit-ups.

39:54.762 --> 39:56.862
So I bought these.

39:56.864 --> 39:58.964
Now every time an ad
pops up online,

39:58.966 --> 40:01.767
I get 30 seconds
of ab-blasting.

40:01.769 --> 40:04.036
I call it ads for abs.

40:04.038 --> 40:07.072
Ironically, I learned about
the boots from an ad online.

40:07.074 --> 40:09.675
- Why can't you just do
regular sit-ups?

40:09.677 --> 40:12.110
- I'll tell you why.

40:12.112 --> 40:13.979
Because...

40:13.981 --> 40:17.049
The floor...

40:17.051 --> 40:19.785
Is...

40:19.787 --> 40:25.090
Disgusting.

40:25.092 --> 40:28.260
Yeah.
My trainer said,

40:28.262 --> 40:31.229
"everybody fails working out."

40:31.231 --> 40:32.931
That's how you win.

40:32.933 --> 40:36.001
Okay.
All right.

40:36.003 --> 40:39.004
Okay.
Kevin, a little help, buddy.

40:39.006 --> 40:43.342
- Oh, why don't your famous
stomachs help you now?

40:43.344 --> 40:46.144
- Can someone please help me?

40:46.146 --> 40:47.646
- Oh, these teas are hot.

40:47.648 --> 40:50.849
Can someone help me, please?

40:50.851 --> 40:51.883
Oh, thanks. Yeah.

40:51.885 --> 40:54.119
Okay.
- Just...

40:54.121 --> 40:57.022
Just...

40:57.024 --> 40:59.324
People,
I'm not going anywhere.

40:59.326 --> 41:01.994
Soon my core
will get strong again,

41:01.996 --> 41:04.896
And, when that happens,
I'll be able...

41:04.898 --> 41:06.098
Head rush!

41:06.100 --> 41:08.967
Ah!

41:08.969 --> 41:10.669
Can someone please help me?

41:10.671 --> 41:12.671
I--
hey.

41:12.673 --> 41:14.272
I'm not going anywhere.

41:14.274 --> 41:16.208
I'll be right here.

41:16.210 --> 41:19.077
Oh, that's not good.

41:19.079 --> 41:21.346
Hey, guys, I've got 20 bucks
for anyone who will help me.

41:21.348 --> 41:23.248
Kevin, would you like a pizza?
