WEBVTT

00:01.168 --> 00:03.502
You pretended
to be in this office

00:03.504 --> 00:05.004
For three months,
and you were

00:05.006 --> 00:07.673
On a [bleep] sailboat.
- I resent that.

00:07.675 --> 00:10.042
I never lied to you.

00:10.044 --> 00:13.245
- Really?
"hey, david, all is good

00:13.247 --> 00:14.546
In scranton, p.A."

00:14.548 --> 00:17.349
- And all was good
in scranton, p.A, that day.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.018
- "by the way,
oscar says hi."

00:19.020 --> 00:21.353
- Oscar says hi
all the time.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.322
He says all kinds of greetings--

00:23.324 --> 00:25.324
Hi, hello, hola.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.192
You're telling me
you've never heard oscar say hi?

00:27.194 --> 00:29.194
- Andy--
- you're calling me a liar?

00:29.196 --> 00:30.562
- Andy--
- by the way, that reminds me.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.131
I want to ask you
about some of the lies

00:32.133 --> 00:34.033
You've been telling me lately.
- Watch it, andy.

00:34.035 --> 00:36.301
- Oh, here we go.
January 7, 2013.

00:36.303 --> 00:38.037
"hey, andy, all's well.

00:38.039 --> 00:40.172
Been meaning to make it down
there, but my wife's sick."

00:40.174 --> 00:41.340
Well, which is it?

00:41.342 --> 00:43.342
Is all well,
or is your wife sick?

00:43.344 --> 00:45.544
Busted!
- My wife?

00:47.347 --> 00:49.181
- This has been
a really tough time.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.215
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.750
- Has it?
- Erin just dumped me,

00:51.752 --> 00:53.352
And I can't remember

00:53.354 --> 00:55.354
Any of the "aha" moments
I had on the boat,

00:55.356 --> 00:57.056
And I know
it sounds weird to say,

00:57.058 --> 00:59.358
But I really miss my beard.
- Shh.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.360
- It was
like a security blanket.

01:01.362 --> 01:04.830
- Andy...

01:04.831 --> 01:06.832
I'm not gonna fire you.

01:08.535 --> 01:09.835
- You're not?

01:09.837 --> 01:12.204
- No.
- That's awesome.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.073
- I wouldn't own the company
if it wasn't for you.

01:14.075 --> 01:17.076
So I owe you that.

01:17.078 --> 01:20.279
- David, I'll be there
for you.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.748
These five words
I swear to you.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.350
When you breathe, I want to be
the air for you.

01:25.352 --> 01:27.386
I'll be there for you.

01:27.388 --> 01:29.421
That's a poem by j.B. Jovi.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.323
I want you to have it.

01:31.325 --> 01:32.858
- We are even now.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.326
Understand?

01:34.328 --> 01:35.727
Got it?
- Crystal.

01:35.729 --> 01:39.231
- And you are on very--
hey.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.232
Very thin ice.

01:40.234 --> 01:43.302
- Vanilla.

01:45.705 --> 01:48.207
Vanilla ice.
He was a band.

01:49.375 --> 01:52.444
[cheerful music]

01:52.446 --> 02:01.286
â™ª

02:24.878 --> 02:27.312
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

02:27.314 --> 02:31.450
- And how are you
on this fine d...

02:31.452 --> 02:36.388
[weeps]

02:51.604 --> 02:53.805
Okay. Ahem.

02:53.807 --> 02:54.873
We ready?

02:54.875 --> 02:57.709
Don't use that part.

02:57.711 --> 03:01.280
Last week, erin told me
that our relationship

03:01.282 --> 03:05.284
Will be proceeding without me.
Ahem.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.686
Now I have to see her
every day at work,

03:07.688 --> 03:12.491
Which is brutal.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.393
When people say office
relationships are a good idea,

03:14.395 --> 03:17.563
They never talk about what
might happen if you break up.

03:17.565 --> 03:21.400
[moaning]

03:21.402 --> 03:25.437
[wailing]

03:25.439 --> 03:28.240
- He sounds
like a wounded animal.

03:28.242 --> 03:31.310
- Should have put him out of
his misery and just fired him.

03:31.312 --> 03:34.313
- I can't be around sad people.
It makes me sad.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.515
- I'm the same way
with horny people.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.450
- Okay.

03:38.452 --> 03:41.253
- [moaning]

03:41.255 --> 03:44.856
- Yes, pete and I
have started seeing each other,

03:44.858 --> 03:46.258
And andy still doesn't know.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.760
We thought
that keeping it secret

03:48.762 --> 03:51.730
Was more considerate to him.
[andy sobbing]

03:51.732 --> 03:54.833
And hot for us.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.703
I mean,
I saw pete's butt.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.304
It's sick.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.943
- Oh, that's mine.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.945
I'll just--I'll get it
out of the way for you.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.781
- Jim set up a job interview
for me today in philly.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.483
It's with a real estate company,

04:11.485 --> 04:14.019
Which is a great fit for me,

04:14.021 --> 04:16.822
Because I live in a house

04:16.824 --> 04:19.257
And I know
what a bathroom is.

04:19.260 --> 04:22.027
I'm sorry.
I am just very nervous,

04:22.029 --> 04:26.265
Because, honestly, this is
all moving a lot faster

04:26.267 --> 04:28.400
Than I expected,
and--and because

04:28.402 --> 04:32.604
My resume can fit
on a post-it note.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.473
- No, don't just let her
eat the grass.

04:34.475 --> 04:35.641
She'll puke it right up.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.442
Okay, just put out two bowls

04:37.444 --> 04:39.911
And see which feed
she prefers.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.513
I'm sorry to be taking up

04:41.515 --> 04:43.282
So much of your precious time,
mose,

04:43.284 --> 04:45.050
But she's your aunt too.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.352
Fine.
I'll see what I can do.

04:50.657 --> 04:52.891
[coin dropping]

04:52.893 --> 04:55.661
- I need you.
- Dah! Dwight.

04:55.663 --> 04:56.828
- And you should take breaks
more often.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.363
I've been waiting there
for 45 minutes.

04:58.365 --> 05:00.299
- What?
What is it?

05:00.301 --> 05:01.333
- It's my aunt shirley.

05:01.335 --> 05:03.035
She's on her last legs.

05:03.037 --> 05:06.405
- Dwight, that's awful.
- You have no idea.

05:06.407 --> 05:10.042
I mean, her hair, her clothes,
it's all falling off

05:10.044 --> 05:14.079
And we need someone to go
out there and clean her up.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.747
We had a nurse,
but she quit,

05:15.749 --> 05:18.483
Because she was "poisoned"
by aunt shirley.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.485
- What do you mean by poisoned?

05:20.487 --> 05:21.787
- Probably nothing.

05:21.789 --> 05:24.356
Or strychnine.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.525
Or lemonade and strychnine,
which is actually what it was.

05:26.527 --> 05:28.694
- Okay, well, I'm very sorry
about your aunt.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.329
- Thank you.
- But I don't see

05:30.331 --> 05:31.697
How this is my problem.

05:31.699 --> 05:34.366
- Angela, you owe me one.
Remember?

05:34.368 --> 05:36.368
Now, please.

05:36.370 --> 05:37.703
She's an old woman, angela.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.004
She needs a woman's touch.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.972
It's all hanging out...
- Ugh.

05:40.974 --> 05:43.008
- And there's parts of her
I don't even recognize.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.711
There's this one hanging part
in particular

05:45.713 --> 05:49.047
That's some sort of flap.
- It's fine.

05:49.049 --> 05:51.016
- It's like a prehensile wing
or something.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.085
I don't know.
- Oh, god. All right.

05:53.087 --> 05:54.519
I can't--okay.

05:54.521 --> 05:57.422
I'll help you.
- There's a divot where it was,

05:57.424 --> 05:59.124
And it needs--
it needs...

06:02.962 --> 06:04.129
- Where are you going?

06:04.131 --> 06:07.733
- Not on a three-month
boat trip.

06:07.735 --> 06:10.669
- Oh, burn.
Ha.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.871
- Excuse me, everyone can just
leave whenever they want now?

06:12.873 --> 06:15.674
- How dare you?

06:15.676 --> 06:18.143
- I'm still the boss.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.783
Mmm.

06:36.763 --> 06:38.864
The answer is yes.
- I have some messages for you.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.599
- Are they from you?

06:40.601 --> 06:41.733
- Well, no,
they're from clients.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.635
- Well, then I don't want them.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.137
You can keep 'em.

06:45.139 --> 06:49.608
In fact you can keep
that big, blue nautica sweater.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.443
I know how much you love it.
- I can't.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.912
- No, I insist upon it.
It's an awesome sweater.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.047
Some great memories
tied up in that thing.

06:56.049 --> 06:58.750
From clients
who want to buy paper.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.585
- I don't want to talk
about work right now.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.754
- Well, I only want
to talk about work right now.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.523
- Then I want
my big blue sweater back.

07:04.525 --> 07:07.459
- Well, I gave it
to the salvation army.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.699
- I've got this seat
adjusted just right.

07:14.701 --> 07:16.568
- Perfect.
Yeah.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.805
- She got rid of it.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.673
My blue sweater.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.442
What is that about?

07:23.444 --> 07:26.011
- I was just leaving.
- Stay.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.613
We are in the brozone layer.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.782
Okay, nard dog, plop,
and clarker posey,

07:30.784 --> 07:32.584
A.K.A. Clarkwork orange.

07:32.586 --> 07:36.455
Here's the sitch.
Erin dumped me, natch,

07:36.457 --> 07:38.457
But she got rid
of my blue sweater,

07:38.459 --> 07:40.125
Which was her favorite.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.794
Is she moving on
a little fast,

07:42.796 --> 07:45.897
Or am I being
a total psycho?

07:45.899 --> 07:47.098
Plop, you go first.

07:47.100 --> 07:50.135
- I don't know.
Women do tend to move on

07:50.137 --> 07:52.604
Quicker than men.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.940
- Survey says...
[makes buzzer sound]

07:54.942 --> 07:57.509
Doesn't make me feel better
at all.

07:57.511 --> 07:59.578
Zero clark thirty,
what do you got?

07:59.580 --> 08:00.712
- Well, look at it this way.

08:00.714 --> 08:01.947
Being a bachelor
is not all bad.

08:01.949 --> 08:05.016
I mean, you got
your freedom now.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.619
- Last night
I ordered a pizza by myself,

08:07.621 --> 08:09.688
And I ate it over the sink
like a rat.

08:09.690 --> 08:10.655
- There you go.
Good for you.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.891
- No.

08:12.893 --> 08:13.892
- You're just letting it
all hang out.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.861
That's what...

08:15.863 --> 08:18.196
- It may not seem like it,
but this really helped,

08:18.198 --> 08:21.032
So thank you.
- Cool.

08:24.570 --> 08:27.806
I'll give you $100 to wear
that sweater to work tomorrow.

08:35.914 --> 08:38.917
- Aunt shirley,
hello, it's me, dwight.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.686
- Oh, looky here.
It's big city dwight.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.121
Careful you don't get mud
on those fancy town shoes,

08:44.124 --> 08:45.257
Big city dwight.

08:45.259 --> 08:46.658
- Hello, aunt shirley.

08:46.660 --> 08:50.228
She's so tiny,
like a little kitchen witch.

08:50.230 --> 08:53.899
- This is angela, and we
brought you some new clothes.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.867
- New clothes?
What for?

08:55.869 --> 08:57.202
- Oh, dear god. Okay.
- Oh. Oh, my god.

08:57.204 --> 09:01.673
- You know what, before you
put the new clothes on,

09:01.675 --> 09:04.576
Angela's gonna get you
cleaned up a little bit.

09:04.578 --> 09:09.581
- Yes. How would you like
a nice, warm bath?

09:09.583 --> 09:10.782
- How would you like
a mean, cold slap?

09:10.784 --> 09:12.317
- Ow!

09:12.319 --> 09:13.718
- Okay, aunt shirley, dear,

09:13.720 --> 09:17.822
Can I get you a nice
crisp liter of schnapps?

09:17.824 --> 09:19.824
- I could do that.
- Okay.

09:19.826 --> 09:21.259
- No. No.
- Yeah, trust me.

09:21.261 --> 09:27.832
Go to the kitchen, get the
largest receptacle you can find.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.734
- Step on it.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.670
- Why doesn't erin seem sad?

09:33.172 --> 09:36.675
Has she found someone new
or something?

09:36.677 --> 09:38.577
And, if so,
why hasn't she told me?

09:38.579 --> 09:42.581
Is she trying to spare
my feelings?

09:42.583 --> 09:46.851
During break-ups, the mind goes
to some crazy dark places.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.997
- Andy, don't.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.832
No good can come
from snooping.

10:00.834 --> 10:01.967
- I'm not snooping.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.635
There's just some crud
on her screen.

10:03.637 --> 10:04.836
- You're clearly snooping.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.171
- That's kind of uncool, man.
- Andy.

10:06.173 --> 10:07.973
- Aw, come on.
- That's her private property.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.975
- Boo!
- Uh, hello?

10:09.977 --> 10:12.077
Who's snooping on who now?

10:12.079 --> 10:14.112
- What does that even mean?

10:14.114 --> 10:15.180
- Everyone, just please--
- what's it say?

10:15.182 --> 10:16.214
- Put it down.
- Andy.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.749
- Hey!
- Come on, andy.

10:17.751 --> 10:18.850
Put it down.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.852
- That's erin's
private property.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.253
- Oh, my god.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.022
- See.
- Nosy'll get you.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.123
- Told him so.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.826
- It just doesn't make
any sense.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.394
- Darryl, clark,
kevin, toby, plop,

10:29.396 --> 10:31.863
Take a knee.

10:31.865 --> 10:35.300
All right, you guys are gonna
think I'm psycho again.

10:35.302 --> 10:39.237
That erin's dating someone,
so I looked at her phone.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.006
- Man, you can't do that stuff.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.707
You'll only find pain.

10:42.709 --> 10:44.843
When my ex-wife got
into my email account,

10:44.845 --> 10:45.844
She was devastated.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.812
- Too late.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.848
I found out she's been texting
a guy named pete.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.917
Does anybody know a pete?

10:56.022 --> 10:57.822
- Pete.
- Hmm.

10:57.824 --> 11:01.760
- It just occurred to me that
andy has been calling me plop

11:01.762 --> 11:04.929
For so long
he forgot my real name.

11:04.931 --> 11:06.431
Which is pete.

11:32.058 --> 11:33.058
- Hello.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.426
- Hey.
There she is.

11:34.428 --> 11:36.027
- [chuckles]

11:36.029 --> 11:38.163
- How you doing?
- Hi.

11:38.165 --> 11:39.798
Hey, do I look okay?

11:39.800 --> 11:40.832
- You look great.
- Okay.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.802
- Yeah.
- What's that?

11:43.804 --> 11:46.905
Where you're going with this,
and this is who I am now.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.240
But look what I can do
with my hands.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.109
- [giggles]
- gotta go.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.744
Vip just walked
through the door.

11:52.746 --> 11:55.046
- How are you, isaac?
You have something in your ear.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.082
- It's a phone.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.718
- Yes, it is,
and thank you so much

11:59.720 --> 12:01.052
For setting up
this opportunity.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.487
I really appreciate it.
- Of course.

12:02.489 --> 12:03.822
Anything for team halpert.

12:03.824 --> 12:04.856
You're gonna crush it, pam.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.124
- Thanks.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.293
- You are gonna crush it.
- Mmh.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.828
- Wow, I missed you.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.897
Or are you saying that to me?
- Call you right back.

12:12.899 --> 12:13.798
What were you saying?

12:13.800 --> 12:15.366
- Ha-ha.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.235
- Aw.
- Hey, jim.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.770
We got trent edwards
on the line.

12:18.772 --> 12:22.140
But, you know what,
team halpert, okay?

12:22.142 --> 12:23.308
You're gonna crush it.

12:23.310 --> 12:24.909
You're gonna smash it.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.244
Okay.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.813
Good luck.
- Bye.

12:28.815 --> 12:30.882
- God, she drank so much.

12:30.884 --> 12:35.887
- Mm. In her prime, shirls
could put away homemade schnapps

12:35.889 --> 12:41.526
Morning, noon, and night.
- [coughs and laughs]

12:41.528 --> 12:44.095
- Now all it takes
is 1/2 liter.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.997
She's dreaming.
All right.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.999
Let's get her out to the yard
so you can spray her down.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.534
- Spray her down?

12:49.536 --> 12:51.870
- No, it's a lot better
than it sounds.

12:51.872 --> 12:54.873
There's a private shower area,

12:54.875 --> 12:57.375
Very tasteful
and very rustic.

13:00.513 --> 13:01.846
- Hey.

13:01.848 --> 13:06.184
- Come on in.
Have a seat.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.519
Uh, thanks for coming in.

13:07.521 --> 13:10.855
I just got to get
something off my chest.

13:10.857 --> 13:15.560
I just got some
really weird news, and, uh,

13:15.562 --> 13:17.896
I'm just gonna come out
and say it.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.931
I just got off the phone
with my doctor,

13:19.933 --> 13:25.837
And turns out I contracted
ch-lamydia from erin.

13:25.839 --> 13:28.206
And it's incurable.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.909
Pretty lame, huh?

13:30.911 --> 13:32.944
- Yeah.

13:42.521 --> 13:45.089
You were gone...

13:45.091 --> 13:46.925
- I knew it!

13:46.927 --> 13:51.262
- For a long time, andy.
- You and erin are f...

13:51.264 --> 13:52.897
- Andy, just so you know,

13:52.899 --> 13:54.332
There was no overlap.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.501
- No overlap?
Great.

13:56.503 --> 13:57.836
Good.
Wow.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.270
This is suddenly so easy.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.339
Guess what?
You're fired.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.340
- What?
- Yeah.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.843
You are fired.

14:04.845 --> 14:06.878
One of the perks
of being boss.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.947
I can fire anyone
who steals my girlfriend.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.950
And, wow, that turns out
to be you.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.017
Yup, sorry.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.253
â™ª so you had a bad day
- andy.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.622
- â™ª the camera don't lie
- andy.

14:17.624 --> 14:20.191
- â™ª you're a big idiot,
get out of my office â™ª

14:20.193 --> 14:22.160
- Andy.
- â™ª turns out you're fired

14:22.162 --> 14:24.329
â™ª because you suck

14:24.331 --> 14:25.296
â™ª and you're fired

14:25.298 --> 14:27.131
- If you want to talk to me,

14:27.133 --> 14:29.100
I'll be in the annex,
all right?

14:29.102 --> 14:30.602
I'm gonna be in the annex.

14:30.604 --> 14:32.604
- [scatting]
- toby.

14:32.606 --> 14:35.440
- [scatting]
- toby.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.108
- You can't fire pete.

14:37.110 --> 14:40.979
You understand why, right?
- No.

14:40.981 --> 14:44.148
- Andy, we had
this exact same conversation

14:44.150 --> 14:45.617
When you wanted
to get rid of nellie.

14:45.619 --> 14:49.354
You can't just get rid of people
over grudges.

14:49.356 --> 14:51.456
- Nellie was
a professional grudge.

14:51.458 --> 14:55.026
This is
a purely personal grudge.

14:55.028 --> 14:57.295
- All right, well, look,
while I have you,

14:57.297 --> 14:59.998
This is a relationship
disclosure form

15:00.000 --> 15:02.667
For pete and erin.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.969
- They already have a contract?

15:08.908 --> 15:11.542
"mutually agree to..."

15:11.544 --> 15:14.946
Every phrase is like a dagger
in my crotch.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.915
- It's just boilerplate.
You don't have to read it.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.082
- Well, I'm not signing away
my rights.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.951
- I already signed it.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.620
I was just showing you.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.656
- Okay, well,
we'll see about that.

15:24.658 --> 15:26.157
- Andy, that's not the original.

15:26.159 --> 15:31.396
And destroying it
will not stop them from dating.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.231
Andy.

15:43.108 --> 15:46.644
It's the original.

15:46.646 --> 15:49.414
- â™ª if they're talking
chester avenue â™ª

15:49.416 --> 15:50.682
â™ª talking triplex

15:50.684 --> 15:52.317
â™ª talking converting

15:52.319 --> 15:53.952
Is that her?

15:53.954 --> 15:55.219
Hey, guys.

15:55.221 --> 15:56.287
Say something. I said--
- hello.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.656
- Hi, I'm mark.
- Hi. Pam. Hello.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.692
- I'm the horrible boss
around here,

16:00.694 --> 16:04.095
But please don't hire
jamie foxx to kill me.

16:04.097 --> 16:07.465
â™ª django

16:07.467 --> 16:10.635
I don't agree with the use
of the n-word in that movie.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.736
It's too soon.

16:11.738 --> 16:14.605
- I'm pam halpert.
- Oh. Hi.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.741
- They call me marky mark
around here,

16:16.743 --> 16:17.742
Because here at simon realty

16:17.744 --> 16:20.712
We are one funky bunch.

16:20.714 --> 16:22.080
Come on, you guys.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.382
Raise the roof
when I say that.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.417
What are you,
all temps again today?

16:26.419 --> 16:29.387
[whistles]
let's go, gangnam-style.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.656
[laughs]
he's heard <i>gangnam style.</i>

16:31.658 --> 16:32.690
He knows it.
Right?

16:32.692 --> 16:34.592
That's 'cause he's american.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.728
This is carl.
- Hi.

16:36.730 --> 16:41.299
- He's, uh, from here.
He's from our neck of the woods.

16:41.301 --> 16:44.602
But <i>gangnam style</i>
<i>is great, isn't it?</i>

16:44.604 --> 16:48.006
- Oh, my god.
He's michael scott.

16:50.142 --> 16:52.443
- [grunts]

16:52.445 --> 16:55.046
- It's hosing time,
aunt shirley.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.447
Have a seat.
You're gonna have a hard time

16:56.449 --> 16:58.616
Hearing her
over the roar of the hose.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.518
- We have to do chains?
- Oh, you'll see.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.786
Here we go.
- Get this show on the road.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.788
- Let's do it.
Ready?

17:03.790 --> 17:05.790
Here's a box cutter
to get her clothes off.

17:05.791 --> 17:07.657
- Dwight!
- Let's get to it.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.327
Give it a whirl.
- No. No.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.329
Dwight, I'm not gonna hose
your aunt down

17:11.330 --> 17:12.563
Like some animal.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.499
- Stop your bellyaching
and hose me.

17:14.501 --> 17:15.665
- I need you to hose my aunt.

17:15.667 --> 17:16.800
- No, dwight.
- Okay, you are useless.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.469
- No, no.
- Give me the hose.

17:18.471 --> 17:21.638
- Dwight, I won't do it.
[both shouting]

17:30.249 --> 17:32.650
I'm gonna give your aunt
a proper bath

17:32.652 --> 17:35.353
And a haircut
like a lady.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.588
And you two
are gonna shut up about it.

17:37.590 --> 17:38.723
Do you have
a bathtub?

17:38.725 --> 17:41.092
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good.

17:41.094 --> 17:43.094
- This is not so much an office

17:43.096 --> 17:46.798
As it is a rec room
with a bunch of computers in it.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.566
And, frankly,
if I had my way,

17:48.568 --> 17:51.269
I'd toss the computers
in the <i>garbage,</i>

17:51.271 --> 17:53.237
But unfortunately we use them

17:53.239 --> 17:56.340
For practically
everything we do, so...

17:56.342 --> 17:57.608
That ain't gonna happen.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.410
He's a temp.
Don't worry about him.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.611
Alice!

18:00.613 --> 18:04.348
All right.
Stay awake, okay?

18:06.552 --> 18:08.319
- Hey, nellie.

18:08.321 --> 18:10.221
Mm.

18:10.223 --> 18:13.558
I am so sick
of February.

18:13.560 --> 18:17.462
It's the shortest month, but it
sure doesn't feel that way.

18:17.464 --> 18:18.863
We should catch up.

18:18.865 --> 18:21.099
- Um...

18:21.101 --> 18:22.600
- You know, I've been going
over my notes from the trial--

18:22.602 --> 18:26.170
- I feel like I might have
glossed over a few minor points.

18:26.172 --> 18:29.307
- No, toby,
you cannot keep blathering on

18:29.309 --> 18:31.209
About this scranton strangler.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.543
Do something about it.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.145
Get it out of your system,
whatever it takes.

18:34.147 --> 18:35.513
- I've been drafting a letter.

18:35.515 --> 18:38.816
Then what? Another year
picking out a stamp?

18:38.818 --> 18:40.618
Another six months
before you decide to lick it?

18:40.620 --> 18:45.523
Just--I don't want
to hear it.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.158
- My aunt joan.

18:47.160 --> 18:50.194
Oh, well, she--she worked here
before I did,

18:50.196 --> 18:52.163
So there's no nepotism involved.

18:52.165 --> 18:54.632
In fact, to be honest with you,
I'm probably a little harder

18:54.634 --> 18:58.336
On her than I am
on the rest of these people.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.505
Can you not work on this?

19:00.507 --> 19:02.607
Work on this month's.

19:02.609 --> 19:05.843
Okay, nana?

19:05.845 --> 19:10.314
When I say, "chillax,"
people chillax.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.683
Watch this.
Hey, roger, chillax.

19:14.520 --> 19:17.388
He must not have heard me.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.790
- No.
I heard you.

19:19.792 --> 19:24.529
- Step this way
for the spanish inquisition.

19:24.531 --> 19:26.764
<i>Kids in the hall.</i>

19:26.766 --> 19:29.400
Just--it's not high pressure.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.502
It's just a little
[brooklyn accent] cawfee talk.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.571
Okay? Like buttah.

19:33.573 --> 19:37.842
Mike myers.
- [mouthing] oh, my god.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.251
- Thank you.

19:47.253 --> 19:48.319
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

19:48.321 --> 19:49.554
Really appreciate it.

19:49.556 --> 19:51.822
You guys were supposed
to have my back, okay?

19:51.824 --> 19:54.892
Instead, you let a guy
named plop steal my girlfriend.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.827
- Hey, boss,
I did everything I could.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.529
I invited pete out for drinks.

19:58.531 --> 20:01.332
I emailed him shots of my junk.
- Ugh.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.201
- Kid doesn't have
a romantic bone in his body.

20:03.203 --> 20:04.969
- Come on, andy.
They're a good match.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.470
- That doesn't matter, okay?

20:06.472 --> 20:10.441
What matters
is that I am hurt.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.543
Deep hurt inside of me.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.646
I don't care if they're romeo
and freaking juliet.

20:15.648 --> 20:19.417
I feel like the guy juliet dated
before romeo.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.385
Probably her boss.

20:21.387 --> 20:22.620
And guess what?

20:22.622 --> 20:24.689
Juliet's boss
also had feelings.

20:24.691 --> 20:27.358
- Hey, andy.
- What?

20:27.360 --> 20:30.561
- You got a booger bubble
going on there.

20:32.664 --> 20:34.899
- Sorry.

20:34.901 --> 20:35.967
- That's okay.

20:35.969 --> 20:39.337
- My whole life
is a booger bubble.

20:45.310 --> 20:47.478
- This is a tiny resume.

20:47.480 --> 20:50.881
[inhales]
papa smurf.

20:50.883 --> 20:53.517
Come back to the mushroom.

20:53.519 --> 20:54.785
- [chuckles]

20:54.787 --> 20:56.587
- It's from <i>the smurfs</i> movie.
- Yeah.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.956
I've seen that with my kids.
It is tiny.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.992
But I've actually
been commissioned

21:00.994 --> 21:03.494
By the city of scranton
to paint a mural--

21:03.496 --> 21:07.331
- What does this say here?
[speaking gibberish]

21:07.333 --> 21:08.799
What language is this?

21:08.801 --> 21:10.868
Swahili?
Oh, wait a second.

21:10.870 --> 21:13.738
Now I can read it.
- Oh, 'cause it was upside-down.

21:13.740 --> 21:16.741
- You're a good audience.

21:16.743 --> 21:20.378
Unlike some of these people
around here.

21:20.380 --> 21:23.314
- Yeah.
The city commissioned me to do--

21:23.316 --> 21:25.549
- Yeah, we don't have a lot of
call for doodling around here.

21:25.551 --> 21:28.819
But I like this resume,
and here's why.

21:28.821 --> 21:31.555
It shows that you
stick around.

21:33.492 --> 21:36.360
Yeah,
you don't jump ship easily

21:36.362 --> 21:39.430
Like a lot of these people.
[sighs]

21:39.432 --> 21:42.566
I mean, they--they worship me,
you know,

21:42.568 --> 21:46.671
But do they like me?

21:46.673 --> 21:51.342
I mean, do you think
they like me, pam?

21:53.545 --> 21:55.646
- Yes.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.015
- What if bob dylan
was your boss?

21:58.017 --> 22:00.584
I'm gonna do dylan.

22:00.586 --> 22:02.987
â™ª

22:02.989 --> 22:05.790
â™ª pam halpert is my name

22:05.792 --> 22:08.793
â™ª I've been
at dunder mifflin for... â™ª

22:08.795 --> 22:11.495
Seven years?
Eight years.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.564
â™ª eight years, man

22:13.566 --> 22:15.666
â™ª got the dunder mifflin blues

22:15.668 --> 22:17.401
â™ª got the pam halpert blues

22:17.403 --> 22:20.538
â™ª got pratt--
went to pratt institute â™ª

22:20.540 --> 22:22.506
You have children?
- Two children, yes.

22:22.508 --> 22:24.675
- And you do art and painting?
- Mm-hmm.

22:24.677 --> 22:26.811
- Kind of the same thing.
â™ª kind of the same thing

22:26.813 --> 22:30.381
â™ª sometimes I repeat myself

22:30.383 --> 22:32.516
â™ª but that's just being pam

22:32.518 --> 22:34.418
â™ª

22:34.420 --> 22:36.420
â™ª well, I'm kinda cute

22:36.422 --> 22:41.525
â™ª and I'm...
But I'm married, so... â™ª

22:41.527 --> 22:43.094
â™ª leave that be

22:43.096 --> 22:46.097
- Hey.
You got a sec to talk?

22:46.099 --> 22:48.566
- Kind of painful
to chat with you, pete,

22:48.568 --> 22:51.035
Ever since the ol' one-two punch
to my scrotum pole,

22:51.037 --> 22:52.636
Translation--penis,

22:52.638 --> 22:54.605
Translation--my manhood.

22:54.607 --> 22:58.542
- Yeah, look, uh...

22:58.544 --> 23:00.678
I understand
break-ups are tough.

23:00.680 --> 23:01.879
You know, it happens
to all of us

23:01.881 --> 23:03.647
At some point
in life.

23:03.649 --> 23:06.650
But you gotta move on.

23:09.688 --> 23:11.555
- Great advice.

23:11.557 --> 23:13.457
Thank you.
You can leave now.

23:13.459 --> 23:14.692
- Listen to him, andy.

23:14.694 --> 23:15.760
He's trying
to tell you something

23:15.762 --> 23:18.662
That you really need to hear.

23:18.664 --> 23:21.766
- Awesome perspective.
Thanks for butting in.

23:21.768 --> 23:24.869
- Well, I've been
where you are now.

23:24.871 --> 23:26.103
I dated this girl alice,

23:26.105 --> 23:27.938
And it was an ugly break-up.

23:27.940 --> 23:31.142
She worked at a marketing agency
right next to my house.

23:31.144 --> 23:33.043
I'd run into her every day,
but I had to grow up

23:33.045 --> 23:35.579
And deal with it,
and I did.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.581
We're even
facebook friends now.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.750
- See?
We can all be friends.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.719
- Yeah.
- Just get over it.

23:41.721 --> 23:43.554
It doesn't have to be awkward.

23:43.556 --> 23:45.656
- I do think we can have
a fair...[voice fading]

23:45.658 --> 23:47.491
Andy: Yeah, so life
gives you lemons,

23:47.493 --> 23:50.661
You just gotta eat 'em,
rinds and all.

23:50.663 --> 23:53.431
Your ex-girlfriend
will shove them down your throat

23:53.433 --> 23:55.199
With the help
of her hunky new boyfriend.

23:55.201 --> 23:57.601
So that's fun.

24:35.644 --> 24:37.877
- Nothing to see here.

24:37.879 --> 24:40.747
Boss at work.

24:40.749 --> 24:43.116
This will be your desk,
right up front.

24:43.118 --> 24:44.951
Best seat on the roller coaster.

24:44.953 --> 24:47.286
You must be this tall
to ride this ride.

24:47.288 --> 24:50.757
No pregnant women allowed.

24:50.759 --> 24:53.960
Are you?
I'm not allowed to ask, so...

24:53.962 --> 24:56.329
- I am not--
- you're not pregnant.

24:56.331 --> 24:58.131
I didn't ask her
if she was pregnant.

24:58.133 --> 24:59.432
She just offered it.

24:59.434 --> 25:03.236
The last three girls here
all got pregnant.

25:03.238 --> 25:05.304
- Wow.
- Don't--don't be afraid.

25:05.306 --> 25:07.173
It's a different chair.

25:07.175 --> 25:09.142
I don't want a guy up here.

25:09.144 --> 25:14.180
I want to, you know, see a woman
come in and do a great job.

25:14.182 --> 25:16.182
Something--I have to look out
this window--

25:16.184 --> 25:18.284
- I'm sorry, I thought this job
was for the position

25:18.286 --> 25:19.352
Of office manager.

25:19.354 --> 25:21.087
- It is.
Yeah.

25:21.089 --> 25:23.256
You'd manage this office.

25:23.258 --> 25:25.792
You'd answer the phone
and forward the calls,

25:25.794 --> 25:28.728
And, you know, go
for a coffee run now and again.

25:28.730 --> 25:30.830
- So kind
of like a receptionist.

25:30.832 --> 25:33.332
- Yeah.
Like a receptionist,

25:33.334 --> 25:36.402
But we call you
the office manager,

25:36.404 --> 25:41.107
Because it's less demeaning.

25:41.109 --> 25:44.811
By the way,
how long are these cameras

25:44.813 --> 25:46.279
Gonna be following you around?

25:46.281 --> 25:50.016
Because I think
this is pretty cool.

25:50.018 --> 25:51.350
[whistles]

25:51.352 --> 25:53.419
Pretty, pretty cool.

25:53.421 --> 25:55.388
Larry david,
<i>curb your enthusiasm.</i>

25:55.390 --> 25:57.156
Do you like that show?
- Yes.

25:57.158 --> 26:00.426
- Well, I think they indulge
themselves a little too much.

26:00.428 --> 26:02.862
[inhales]

26:02.864 --> 26:04.163
I like scripted.

26:04.165 --> 26:07.133
I spent ten years
as a receptionist

26:07.135 --> 26:08.434
To michael scott.

26:08.436 --> 26:12.872
And I have kids now.

26:12.874 --> 26:16.876
And I just--
I can't.

26:19.279 --> 26:21.848
- Ow.
The braid is too tight.

26:21.850 --> 26:23.449
- Oh, hush.

26:23.451 --> 26:26.285
Loose braids reflect
a loose character.

26:26.287 --> 26:28.755
Now stay still.

26:28.757 --> 26:30.757
- Yes, ma'am.

26:30.759 --> 26:33.993
- I think your hair is much too
long for your age, by the way.

26:33.995 --> 26:36.162
- Okay.

26:36.164 --> 26:39.298
- There.

26:39.300 --> 26:41.400
- Thank you, angela.

26:42.436 --> 26:44.804
- I'm going to the prison

26:44.806 --> 26:47.507
This afternoon
to go and talk to the strangler.

26:47.509 --> 26:51.177
- Probably best to use his
real name rather than strangler.

26:51.179 --> 26:54.280
- Don't use his real name.

26:54.282 --> 26:56.149
George howard skub?

26:56.151 --> 26:58.284
That's a devil name.

26:58.286 --> 27:01.320
- Anyway, I just wanted to say
I'm doing it.

27:01.322 --> 27:04.223
I'm going.

27:04.225 --> 27:06.392
- He's doing it.

27:07.561 --> 27:09.362
- The fact that you've
been able to cover--

27:09.364 --> 27:11.364
[cell phone buzzes]

27:11.366 --> 27:12.431
- Hey.

27:12.433 --> 27:13.966
- Hey, how'd the interview go?

27:13.968 --> 27:15.401
- Oh, my gosh.
Wait until I tell you.

27:15.403 --> 27:17.537
This guy was unbelievable.

27:17.539 --> 27:19.205
Okay, so--
- I can't wait

27:19.207 --> 27:20.973
To hear about it later.

27:20.975 --> 27:22.909
Do you want to come in at 8:00?
And don't eat,

27:22.911 --> 27:23.910
Because I'm ordering in.

27:23.912 --> 27:25.378
- 8:00?
Really?

27:25.380 --> 27:27.380
- I'll make it worth your while,
I promise.

27:27.382 --> 27:29.849
- Sure.
I mean, it's philly.

27:29.851 --> 27:31.317
I can kill four hours.

27:31.319 --> 27:33.219
So, yeah,
I'll see you at 8:00.

27:33.221 --> 27:35.855
- All right. Love you.
- Love you.

27:41.562 --> 27:43.262
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:43.264 --> 27:45.031
- I'm here
from bci marketing consultants

27:45.033 --> 27:46.399
To meet
with andrew bernard.

27:46.401 --> 27:48.067
- Oh, yes,
the consultant.

27:48.069 --> 27:49.869
Andy said you can start
right away.

27:49.871 --> 27:51.437
So I will take you
to your desk.

27:51.439 --> 27:53.105
- Oh, okay, great.
Thanks.

27:53.107 --> 27:55.441
- Mm.
Fresh meat.

27:55.443 --> 27:57.376
Fresh meat!
[making kissing noises]

27:57.378 --> 27:59.345
- Just keep walking.
Don't give her anything.

27:59.347 --> 28:01.047
She'll take it and run.

28:01.049 --> 28:02.315
I'm erin by the way.
- Nice to meet you.

28:02.317 --> 28:04.016
Cute sweater.
- Oh, thanks.

28:04.018 --> 28:06.319
Your shoes match.
I'm bad at small talk.

28:06.321 --> 28:08.387
- I'm kevin.

28:11.625 --> 28:14.360
- Pete?

28:14.362 --> 28:16.896
- Alice.

28:16.898 --> 28:18.364
[softly]
oh, my god.

28:18.366 --> 28:19.332
- It's been a while, huh?

28:19.334 --> 28:20.533
- Oh, do you two
know each other?

28:20.535 --> 28:22.969
- Yeah.
We have a history.

28:22.971 --> 28:25.338
- Oh.
- History. Wow.

28:25.340 --> 28:28.341
Okay.
We dated for two years.

28:28.343 --> 28:29.876
- That's so random.

28:29.878 --> 28:32.578
- Well, is it?

28:32.580 --> 28:37.016
- Andy also hired
a management consultant today.

28:39.086 --> 28:41.454
Oh, no.

28:47.628 --> 28:49.161
- Hey, erin,
look who's back.

28:49.163 --> 28:50.463
The birdman.

28:50.465 --> 28:53.399
- Hello, beautiful.

28:53.401 --> 28:55.401
- Didn't you two used to do it?

28:55.403 --> 28:59.472
- We absolutely did.
Thank you for remembering that.

29:06.513 --> 29:09.081
- Hi.
Toby flenderson.

29:09.083 --> 29:10.416
I'm here to see
george howard skub.

29:10.418 --> 29:13.085
This is the prison.

29:13.087 --> 29:15.288
I am not going in there

29:15.290 --> 29:18.190
With expectations, per se.

29:18.192 --> 29:21.060
I will meet
george howard skub.

29:21.062 --> 29:24.964
I will tell him that I believe
he is innocent.

29:24.966 --> 29:28.401
I would understand if he
felt motivated to hug me.

29:28.403 --> 29:31.170
I would understand
if a friendship began.

29:31.172 --> 29:33.139
How did bogart put it?

29:33.141 --> 29:35.107
[as bogart] I think
this is the start

29:35.109 --> 29:38.544
Of my first friendship.

29:38.546 --> 29:40.346
- So pete was a librarian?

29:40.348 --> 29:43.716
- He worked as a librarian
freshman year.

29:43.718 --> 29:45.952
- Was he, like,
the sexy librarian?

29:45.954 --> 29:48.087
- Okay.
- Is there somebody

29:48.089 --> 29:49.388
Who's in charge
of marketing?

29:49.390 --> 29:53.259
Maybe I should sit
near him or her.

29:54.695 --> 29:56.028
- Hi.
How's it going?

29:56.030 --> 29:58.097
- Hi.
Good.

29:58.099 --> 30:00.299
- I'd love to discuss strategy
with you

30:00.301 --> 30:02.535
If you have a marketing--
- wow, this sure is intense.

30:02.537 --> 30:05.738
Having to share a workspace
with someone

30:05.740 --> 30:08.007
You used to get it on with.

30:08.009 --> 30:10.109
- Andy, that is
really inappropriate.

30:10.111 --> 30:12.578
- Awkward!
- It is awkward.

30:12.580 --> 30:16.115
This is a really uncomfortable
situation that you've contrived.

30:16.117 --> 30:19.051
- Really uncomfortable
situation.

30:19.053 --> 30:21.620
- Yeah.

30:21.622 --> 30:23.422
- That's all right, pete.
You can handle it.

30:23.424 --> 30:25.992
I mean, we all
just gotta move on.

30:25.994 --> 30:27.727
Ain't that right,
professor lecture-much?

30:27.729 --> 30:30.162
Uh, question.

30:30.164 --> 30:32.131
How's that medicine taste?

30:32.133 --> 30:34.400
Your own-flavored?

30:34.402 --> 30:37.103
Is it just me,
or have these tables turned?

30:39.406 --> 30:42.675
Hmm.
Hmm.

30:47.781 --> 30:50.049
- So there's
no marketing department?

30:50.051 --> 30:52.151
Both: No.

30:52.153 --> 30:53.519
- You know,
times were tough.

30:53.521 --> 30:54.754
I was unemployed.

30:54.756 --> 30:56.655
I was still heartbroken
over you.

30:56.657 --> 31:02.395
But as you can see I put
all that weight right back on.

31:02.397 --> 31:04.063
Feel how fat my buttocks are.

31:04.065 --> 31:06.632
Yeah.
It's crazy.

31:06.634 --> 31:08.467
Touch it.
It's like a warm pumpkin.

31:08.469 --> 31:11.170
- So andy just called you up
out of the blue?

31:11.172 --> 31:13.706
- Yeah.
He told me you two broke up.

31:15.108 --> 31:17.710
You must be pretty horny.

31:21.681 --> 31:24.150
- Well, the good news is,
no more guilty conscience.

31:24.152 --> 31:26.485
At least you know
he is the strangler.

31:26.487 --> 31:28.521
The proof is in the grip.

31:28.523 --> 31:34.226
Did they say when
the vocal cords would heal?

31:34.228 --> 31:37.730
One week?
Okay.

31:37.732 --> 31:41.133
Two weeks?

31:41.135 --> 31:43.202
Okay.

31:43.204 --> 31:47.139
You offered your neck
in search of the truth.

31:47.141 --> 31:49.475
The proud neck of justice--
isn't that the expression?

31:49.477 --> 31:52.411
Well, anyway,
it was--it was very brave.

31:56.750 --> 31:59.118
It really was quite brave.

32:02.689 --> 32:05.124
- I feel like a show pony.

32:05.126 --> 32:07.326
- And you look like one too.
Thank you, angela.

32:07.328 --> 32:09.395
- You're welcome.
Would you like some stew?

32:09.397 --> 32:14.433
- By all means. And I will carve
the roast skunk.

32:14.435 --> 32:16.802
Angela.
- Mm-hmm?

32:16.804 --> 32:18.871
- Would you like
the stink sack?

32:18.873 --> 32:20.773
- Is it any good?
- No.

32:20.775 --> 32:23.175
You don't eat it.
It's a toy, like a wishbone.

32:23.177 --> 32:24.777
You know, prettiest girl
gets the stink sack.

32:24.779 --> 32:26.445
- Thank you.

32:26.447 --> 32:30.483
- So when's the wedding?

32:30.485 --> 32:31.884
- Um...

32:31.886 --> 32:34.854
Actually, we are just friends.

32:34.856 --> 32:37.590
- That's what mose said
about his lady scarecrow,

32:37.592 --> 32:40.392
And look what he did
to that poor thing.

32:40.394 --> 32:42.128
- Hello?

32:42.130 --> 32:43.696
- Hey.
Back here.

32:43.698 --> 32:47.600
- [laughs]

32:47.602 --> 32:50.402
Wow.
Seriously?

32:50.404 --> 32:51.770
Oh, my gosh.

32:51.772 --> 32:53.439
Is that champagne?
- <i>Si, seÃ±or.</i>

32:53.441 --> 32:54.840
[pop]

32:54.842 --> 32:58.544
- Oh, jim, I should have
told you I didn't get the job.

32:58.546 --> 33:01.147
- Oh, man.
I'm so sorry.

33:01.149 --> 33:02.548
Are you all right?
- Oh, yeah.

33:02.550 --> 33:03.649
I'm more than all right.

33:03.651 --> 33:04.783
There's just nothing
to celebrate?

33:04.785 --> 33:05.784
- Are you kidding?

33:05.786 --> 33:06.852
You're in philly.

33:06.854 --> 33:10.222
And this is
just consolation champagne.

33:10.224 --> 33:13.459
That immediately gave up
to the nazis.

33:13.461 --> 33:14.693
- [chuckles]
- here.

33:14.695 --> 33:16.762
- You're very quick
on your feet.

33:16.764 --> 33:17.830
I remember you.

33:17.832 --> 33:19.798
Funny.

33:19.800 --> 33:23.869
- All right, so tell me
all about it.

33:25.739 --> 33:28.307
- Okay, well...

33:28.309 --> 33:30.876
Gosh, thank you
for your help today.

33:30.878 --> 33:33.479
Your perspective
was very useful.

33:33.481 --> 33:34.647
Thank you.

33:34.649 --> 33:36.549
- It was not an unpleasant way

33:36.551 --> 33:40.352
To spend an afternoon.

33:49.729 --> 33:52.264
Dwight, dwight.
- Right.

33:52.266 --> 33:54.300
Not outside.
The horseflies.

33:54.302 --> 33:56.535
You know what, my farm is
only a few acres east of here.

33:56.537 --> 33:59.905
Or we could use
the slaughterhouse.

33:59.907 --> 34:02.408
- No, dwight,
the senator.

34:02.410 --> 34:06.378
- Leave him. He probably won't
even notice that you're gone.

34:06.380 --> 34:07.980
Be with me, monkey.

34:07.982 --> 34:11.317
- I can't be
your monkey, dwight.

34:11.319 --> 34:14.420
- I'm not talking
about some frisky romp

34:14.422 --> 34:18.591
We have wasted too much
of our lives ignoring the fact

34:18.592 --> 34:22.328
That we belong together.

34:22.330 --> 34:26.232
The 80 or 90 years that I
have left of this life...

34:26.234 --> 34:28.467
I want to spend with you.

34:30.337 --> 34:31.904
- I made a vow.

34:31.906 --> 34:33.806
I gave my word.

34:33.808 --> 34:37.409
- Stand by your man.

34:41.248 --> 34:44.783
It's what I would want
if you were mine.

34:44.784 --> 34:46.851
- Good night, d.

34:53.560 --> 34:54.860
- How are you doing?

34:54.862 --> 34:57.796
Is it really rough?
- It is so unpleasant.

34:57.798 --> 34:59.732
You?
- Hey, love turds.

34:59.734 --> 35:02.401
Conference room now.

35:05.605 --> 35:07.573
Thank you all for coming in.

35:07.575 --> 35:09.441
Just wanted to check in.

35:09.443 --> 35:12.344
How was everyone's day?

35:12.346 --> 35:16.348
- Honestly,
it was a little weird.

35:16.350 --> 35:19.618
- Really?
Hmm.

35:19.620 --> 35:22.888
That's interesting,
because erin and pete

35:22.890 --> 35:25.024
Thought it wouldn't be weird
at all.

35:25.026 --> 35:26.759
Why do you think
it was weird, gabe?

35:26.761 --> 35:29.461
Maybe because you and erin
used to be an item?

35:30.430 --> 35:32.431
- I still wear
erin's button-downs

35:32.433 --> 35:33.899
Around the condo sometimes,

35:33.901 --> 35:36.302
So it feels to me like we're
still in a relationship...

35:36.304 --> 35:37.836
- Gabe.
- A lot of the time.

35:37.838 --> 35:39.972
- Ugh.

35:39.974 --> 35:41.974
- And, alice, I understand

35:41.976 --> 35:45.444
You once dumped pete.
Ouch.

35:45.446 --> 35:46.745
- It was an amicable break-up,
andy.

35:46.747 --> 35:48.747
- Okay,
while we're rewriting history,

35:48.749 --> 35:50.683
You never had
a drinking problem.

35:50.685 --> 35:51.950
- It was college.

35:51.952 --> 35:53.619
That is what you do.

35:53.621 --> 35:55.354
- Dude, you're also supposed
to go to classes,

35:55.356 --> 35:58.791
- Hey, andy, is this
at all work-related?

35:58.793 --> 36:00.059
- We'll get to that.

36:00.061 --> 36:02.061
Gabe, did erin ever tell you

36:02.063 --> 36:06.598
- [laughs] no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.467
She wouldn't even
let me say it.

36:08.469 --> 36:10.402
It was adorable.
She'd plug her ears

36:10.404 --> 36:12.738
- Gabe,
can you stop talking?

36:12.740 --> 36:14.440
Because every word
out of your mouth

36:14.442 --> 36:16.008
Is like the squawk
of an ugly pelican.

36:16.010 --> 36:18.510
- I got a tattoo for you.

36:18.512 --> 36:21.046
- I didn't ask you
to get that nike swoosh.

36:21.048 --> 36:22.514
Nobody did.
You did that for you.

36:22.516 --> 36:24.450
- Just do it.

36:24.452 --> 36:27.486
You were the it
that I was just doing.

36:27.488 --> 36:28.787
- So you're dating
a secretary now?

36:28.789 --> 36:30.389
Moving up in the world,
pete.

36:30.391 --> 36:32.825
- She's nice to me.

36:32.827 --> 36:34.760
- How's that p.E. Degree
coming?

36:34.762 --> 36:37.429
His dream in college
was to be a gym teacher.

36:37.431 --> 36:38.731
- Well, guess what,

36:38.733 --> 36:39.998
He could still be a gym teacher.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.600
In fact, we could all
still be gym teachers.

36:41.602 --> 36:43.669
So let's--
- I technically cannot.

36:43.671 --> 36:45.537
I don't have the lung capacity
to blow a whistle.

36:45.539 --> 36:47.539
- Oh, my god.

36:49.476 --> 36:51.076
What kind of music
are you into, peter?

36:51.078 --> 36:54.012
- Uh, I like
all kinds of music, gabe.

36:54.014 --> 36:56.415
- Really?
All kinds?

36:56.417 --> 36:59.618
Written by the white knights
of ku klux klan?

36:59.620 --> 37:01.053
Erin, are you even hearing this?
- No!

37:01.055 --> 37:02.721
- Gabe, he didn't even
say that.

37:02.723 --> 37:03.889
- He's not
a very sophisticated man.

37:03.891 --> 37:05.591
I mean,
he can't use chopsticks,

37:05.593 --> 37:06.792
So do I need
to say anything else?

37:06.794 --> 37:10.396
- [laughs]
erin, I've been to japan.

37:10.398 --> 37:12.097
I know how to use chopsticks
so well.

37:12.099 --> 37:14.600
Come back.

37:14.602 --> 37:16.435
One night.
Give me one night with you.

37:16.437 --> 37:17.936
- What is that supposed to be?
- I have shaved everything.

37:17.938 --> 37:19.104
- I don't want you to shave--

37:19.106 --> 37:20.906
- I wasted two years
of my life on you.

37:20.908 --> 37:22.708
You realize that, right?
- I just want to be real clear

37:22.710 --> 37:24.977
That chopsticks
is not the measure of a man.

37:24.979 --> 37:27.613
- I am as smooth
as a porpoise for you.

37:27.615 --> 37:28.714
- Why didn't you say
at the beginning,

37:28.716 --> 37:29.782
"this isn't really going
that well"?

37:29.784 --> 37:31.784
- Shovel his sashimi
into his mouth

37:31.786 --> 37:33.452
As a sport.

37:33.454 --> 37:34.787
Andy: All right,
all right, yes,

37:34.789 --> 37:36.455
That is a legitimate question.

37:36.457 --> 37:38.424
Does making erin and pete
feel bad

37:38.426 --> 37:41.093
Make me feel better?

37:41.095 --> 37:42.928
Yeah.

37:42.930 --> 37:46.465
Yeah. It does.

37:46.467 --> 37:49.034
- So imagine, like,
the real estate version

37:49.036 --> 37:51.203
Of michael scott,
and that was this guy.

37:51.205 --> 37:53.439
He did half the interview
as ace ventura.

37:53.441 --> 37:55.140
- Tell me about the cologne.
How much?

37:55.142 --> 37:57.443
- Oh.
An entire bottle at least.

37:57.445 --> 37:59.077
- You're definitely
hoarding this, by the way.

37:59.079 --> 38:02.114
- Guess--guess what poster
he had on his wall?

38:02.116 --> 38:04.516
- <i>Austin powers.</i>
<i>- Mm-mm.</i>

38:04.518 --> 38:05.884
- <i>Ferris bueller.</i>
<i>- Mm-mm.</i>

38:05.886 --> 38:07.553
You're getting colder.

38:07.555 --> 38:09.188
- Not <i>night at the roxbury.</i>

38:09.190 --> 38:11.557
- No.

38:11.559 --> 38:14.460
<i>The odd life</i>
<i>of timothy green.</i>

38:14.462 --> 38:17.229
- I'm sorry. How did you think
I was expected to guess that?

38:17.231 --> 38:19.198
- I don't know.
But it's interesting, right?

38:19.200 --> 38:21.667
- It's fascinating.
- He said he can't help

38:21.669 --> 38:23.869
But tear up when he looks at it,
and it's right next to his desk.

38:23.871 --> 38:25.871
He must look at it,
like, 20 times a day.

38:25.873 --> 38:27.806
- That's amazing.

38:27.808 --> 38:29.141
Well, listen,
you can't win 'em all, right?

38:29.143 --> 38:31.243
- Mm-hmm.
- So the next interview

38:31.245 --> 38:33.846
Has to be better.

38:33.848 --> 38:35.180
- I don't know.

38:35.182 --> 38:36.782
- What do you mean?

38:36.784 --> 38:39.184
Of course it will.
You're amazing.

38:40.787 --> 38:42.554
- I know.
It's just, even if it was

38:42.556 --> 38:44.089
A great boss
and a great job,

38:44.091 --> 38:46.225
I just--I don't--
I don't know if I--

38:46.227 --> 38:49.928
If I want to--
I don't know if I want this.

38:55.668 --> 38:57.202
- Huh.

39:01.107 --> 39:03.742
This is a little
out of left field.

39:03.744 --> 39:05.611
- Is it?

39:10.183 --> 39:14.286
I just--
I liked our life in scranton.

39:16.689 --> 39:21.126
- And I have started a business
in philadelphia.

39:33.907 --> 39:35.974
- Little
did my grandfather know,

39:35.976 --> 39:38.877
Mahjong would be here
to stay.

39:38.879 --> 39:42.648
- <i>Hobbies of the east</i>
<i>continues in a moment.</i>

39:45.785 --> 39:47.853
- [clears throat]

39:47.855 --> 39:49.988
You could all be doing this.

39:49.990 --> 39:51.623
Just saying.

39:51.625 --> 39:52.958
I watch way too many ads online,

39:52.960 --> 39:54.760
And I don't do enough sit-ups.

39:54.762 --> 39:56.862
So I bought these.

39:56.864 --> 39:58.964
Now every time an ad
pops up online,

39:58.966 --> 40:01.767
I get 30 seconds
of ab-blasting.

40:01.769 --> 40:04.036
I call it ads for abs.

40:04.038 --> 40:07.072
Ironically, I learned about
the boots from an ad online.

40:07.074 --> 40:09.675
- Why can't you just do
regular sit-ups?

40:09.677 --> 40:12.110
- I'll tell you why.

40:12.112 --> 40:13.979
Because...

40:13.981 --> 40:17.049
The floor...

40:17.051 --> 40:19.785
Is...

40:19.787 --> 40:25.090
Disgusting.

40:25.092 --> 40:28.260
Yeah.
My trainer said,

40:28.262 --> 40:31.229
"everybody fails working out."

40:31.231 --> 40:32.931
That's how you win.

40:32.933 --> 40:36.001
Okay.
All right.

40:36.003 --> 40:39.004
Okay.
Kevin, a little help, buddy.

40:39.006 --> 40:43.342
- Oh, why don't your famous
stomachs help you now?

40:43.344 --> 40:46.144
- Can someone please help me?

40:46.146 --> 40:47.646
- Oh, these teas are hot.

40:47.648 --> 40:50.849
Can someone help me, please?

40:50.851 --> 40:51.883
Oh, thanks. Yeah.

40:51.885 --> 40:54.119
Okay.
- Just...

40:54.121 --> 40:57.022
Just...

40:57.024 --> 40:59.324
People,
I'm not going anywhere.

40:59.326 --> 41:01.994
Soon my core
will get strong again,

41:01.996 --> 41:04.896
And, when that happens,
I'll be able...

41:04.898 --> 41:06.098
Head rush!

41:06.100 --> 41:08.967
Ah!

41:08.969 --> 41:10.669
Can someone please help me?

41:10.671 --> 41:12.671
I--
hey.

41:12.673 --> 41:14.272
I'm not going anywhere.

41:14.274 --> 41:16.208
I'll be right here.

41:16.210 --> 41:19.077
Oh, that's not good.

41:19.079 --> 41:21.346
Hey, guys, I've got 20 bucks
for anyone who will help me.

41:21.348 --> 41:23.248
Kevin, would you like a pizza?
