(birds chirping)

00:08.758 --> 00:12.095
(wind blowing)

00:14.305 --> 00:17.475
(quiet footsteps)

00:20.270 --> 00:21.855
Howdy!

00:21.855 --> 00:23.231
Here we go.

00:25.942 --> 00:29.529
Understand our, uh,
our sons got into
a bit of a fight.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.239
Yeah, sure did.

00:32.323 --> 00:34.534
(sighs)
I'm sorry I hit you.

00:35.618 --> 00:37.746
How do you not know
"Call of Duty"?

00:37.746 --> 00:40.081
Gotta admit,
it's kinda weird he never
heard of "Call of Duty."

00:40.081 --> 00:41.833
I mean, game's been
around for years.

00:41.833 --> 00:44.085
There's, like,
15 versions of it.

00:44.085 --> 00:45.503
Yeah, well, uh, we don't, uh,

00:45.503 --> 00:47.797
we don't play video games
at our house.

00:48.298 --> 00:49.883
But that's okay if y'all do.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.593
That's weird.

00:53.928 --> 00:56.598
Yeah, why don't you, uh, tell
him the thing we talked about?

00:56.598 --> 00:58.016
Go on.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.187
I hope...

01:03.062 --> 01:06.357
I hope we can be together
next time in harmony.

01:07.859 --> 01:11.154
Well, uh,
we'll look into that.
Come on, pal.

01:16.743 --> 01:17.952
Barry:
Huh?

01:17.952 --> 01:20.538
(birds continue chirping)

01:20.538 --> 01:23.458
John:
I wish Travis was nice
to me after I apologized.

01:23.458 --> 01:25.502
Barry:
Well, you can't control
other people, bud.

01:25.502 --> 01:27.170
We can only control ourselves.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.798
John: The more
I think about it, the more
I wanna punch him again.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.800
Barry:
Yeah, that's called insecurity.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.552
You keep practicing what
you just did over there,

01:34.552 --> 01:36.679
and you'll grow.

01:36.679 --> 01:38.306
You'll be
a better person for it.

01:38.306 --> 01:40.350
But even his dad wasn't nice.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.268
I picked up on that.
(sighs)

01:42.268 --> 01:44.229
But you didn't see me
get mad, did you?

01:45.188 --> 01:46.231
No.

01:46.564 --> 01:48.691
I know how you feel, buddy.

01:48.691 --> 01:51.986
You know, your dad
used to get mad. A lot.

01:53.029 --> 01:56.616
But, uh, eventually, I was able
to control those feelings,

01:56.616 --> 02:00.328
and then I had you,
and I changed.

02:00.328 --> 02:02.330
I'm really proud of you.

02:02.330 --> 02:04.749
It's a hard thing that you did.

02:04.749 --> 02:08.294
You messed up, but you
took responsibility for it.

02:09.754 --> 02:11.881
It's the right way to live.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.717
Barry:
Oh, I don't think
we have time for that.

02:14.717 --> 02:16.094
John:
I think I can do it.

02:16.094 --> 02:17.679
Barry:
Let's try it.

02:18.346 --> 02:20.557
Barry:
Here we go.
Okay, you ready?

02:20.557 --> 02:22.392
(continues, indistinct)

02:23.977 --> 02:25.603
(Sally sighs)

02:27.730 --> 02:29.524
(chatter continues)

02:29.524 --> 02:31.359
(metallic clang)

02:31.359 --> 02:32.944
(Sally hums)

02:32.944 --> 02:35.864
Barry:
Let Dad do that.
Let Dad do that.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.031
- Dad'll do it.
- John: Okay.

02:37.031 --> 02:39.325
Dad's gonna do it.
Okay? Here we go.

02:40.243 --> 02:42.871
(Sally continues humming)

02:44.122 --> 02:47.959
- (muffled thud)
- Barry: No. Pick it up.
Pick it up.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.878
Host (on computer):
<i>...his face is the penny,</i>

02:49.878 --> 02:52.213
<i>as well as the $5 bill.</i>

02:52.714 --> 02:56.968
<i>Lincoln was born
February 12th, 1809,
in Kentucky.</i>

02:57.510 --> 03:00.847
<i>His family was
very poor and lived</i>

03:00.847 --> 03:02.682
<i>in a one-room log cabin.</i>

03:02.682 --> 03:05.643
<i>Later, when Lincoln
was 9 years old,</i>

03:05.643 --> 03:08.563
<i>his mother suddenly died.</i>

03:11.858 --> 03:14.485
Stupid bull got up there
and got his horn
stuck in my bumper.

03:14.485 --> 03:16.279
- About pulled it off.
- (country music playing)

03:16.279 --> 03:18.740
So now, I gotta replace that,
I gotta replace the--

03:18.740 --> 03:21.409
(Southern accent)
Here y'all go. Got your
breakfast right here.

03:21.409 --> 03:24.287
- Thank you, Miss Emily.
- Now, who needs a warm-up?

03:24.287 --> 03:27.123
- I'll take one.
- (pouring coffee)

03:27.123 --> 03:29.542
Kyle? How you doin'
this morning?

03:29.542 --> 03:32.629
- You enjoying a short stack?
- I sure am, Miss Ginny.

03:32.629 --> 03:33.838
Oh...

03:33.838 --> 03:36.466
(quietly)
I'm gonna need
a fucking Xanny.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.468
Oh! Mm!

03:38.468 --> 03:40.929
(muffled country music)

03:41.971 --> 03:43.306
(exhales)

03:43.306 --> 03:45.475
Oh, hey.
Did I tell you?

03:45.475 --> 03:49.520
- Amber made cheer squad.
- Oh, hey, that's so great.

03:50.021 --> 03:53.191
- You must be so proud.
- Oh, yeah. We're havin'
a big shindig to celebrate.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.902
You should come.
We're gonna fry a turkey.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.279
Oh, you know,
I'd love to, but...

03:58.279 --> 04:01.407
- we got Clark's mom, so...
- Oh, well, bring 'em all.

04:01.407 --> 04:03.993
Yeah, I know,
but she's, um...

04:03.993 --> 04:06.829
She's hooked up to
all them machines,

04:06.829 --> 04:09.499
and I'm afraid to...

04:09.499 --> 04:13.336
- unplug 'em.
- Oh, that's fuckin' stressful.

04:14.128 --> 04:15.880
Yep. (exhales)

04:15.880 --> 04:18.091
Shit's real stressful.

04:19.634 --> 04:22.262
Uh... (exhales)

04:22.262 --> 04:25.056
Bevel told me
he jerks off to you.

04:26.307 --> 04:29.602
- (cash register clicking)
- (indistinct chatter)

04:31.104 --> 04:32.939
Hey, Emily.

04:33.564 --> 04:36.025
What are you doin' right now?

04:36.025 --> 04:38.152
Cashing out.

04:38.152 --> 04:40.154
(beeping)

04:40.154 --> 04:42.240
(bell rings,
drawer opens)

04:42.240 --> 04:43.950
- That's cool.
- (sighs)

04:45.076 --> 04:47.203
That's really fuckin' cool.

04:50.331 --> 04:51.666
Cool.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.382
(shuts register)

05:00.967 --> 05:02.593
Barry (on phone):
<i>And apparently,
he was a lawyer</i>

05:02.593 --> 05:05.513
<i>before he
became the president.
Did you know that?</i>

05:05.513 --> 05:07.098
Sally:
I knew that, yeah.

05:07.098 --> 05:09.559
Barry:
<i>I think it's a good thing
for John to see that stuff.</i>

05:09.559 --> 05:13.187
<i>You know, that, I don't know,
despite his circumstances,</i>

05:13.187 --> 05:15.940
<i>he could be a lawyer.</i>

05:15.940 --> 05:17.608
Sally:
Yeah, no, totally.

05:17.608 --> 05:20.862
I think it's great he's learning
about all that now. I mean,

05:20.862 --> 05:24.991
I don't think I learned about
George Washington or Abe Lincoln

05:24.991 --> 05:27.785
till I was much older, so...

05:27.785 --> 05:30.496
Barry:
<i>Yeah, totally.</i>

05:30.496 --> 05:32.749
What else did you guys
learn about?

05:33.291 --> 05:35.710
Barry:
<i>You mean, what else
did I teach him?</i>

05:35.710 --> 05:37.462
Uh-huh.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.088
Barry:
<i>Oh, just basic math.</i>

05:39.088 --> 05:41.591
<i>You know, I wanna get
into long division...</i>

05:41.591 --> 05:43.676
(barely audible)
<i>math stuff, two plus two.</i>

05:43.676 --> 05:46.262
<i>Things that,
basically, you know,
what we could try to do</i>

05:46.262 --> 05:49.432
<i>is come up with stuff
with, like, division,</i>

05:49.432 --> 05:51.851
<i>things like that.
You know, that's
what I'm hoping--</i>

05:51.851 --> 05:54.062
Hey, what do you guys
want for dinner?

05:56.814 --> 05:59.984
Barry:
(sighs) You know what
I like about Old Abe?

05:59.984 --> 06:04.113
And, uh, it's actually
something I relate to

06:04.113 --> 06:07.450
which is he had this beautiful
combination of, um...

06:08.034 --> 06:11.829
What was it?
Pragmatism, optimism,
and compromise.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.875
Absolutely. I see that.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.461
- No, what you said. Um...
- (sighs)

06:18.461 --> 06:22.131
- Pragmatism, optimism,
and compromise.
- And compromise. Yeah.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.467
'Cause I-I think that's
the building blocks

06:24.467 --> 06:27.261
of anyone worth his salt.
I really do.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.350
And he's now on a penny.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.729
No, he's a real success story,

06:36.729 --> 06:38.439
that Abe Lincoln,

06:38.439 --> 06:42.443
'cause he worked hard,
and now he's on a penny.

06:42.443 --> 06:43.861
(sharp inhale)

06:43.861 --> 06:48.116
And a lot of pennies
can buy you socks...

06:49.117 --> 06:51.452
um...

06:51.452 --> 06:54.288
shoelaces.
You use those. (laughs)

06:54.288 --> 06:57.625
I've seen you. Um...

06:57.625 --> 06:59.168
hairpins...

06:59.168 --> 07:02.338
- He's an intricate
part of our life, John.
- Mm-hmm.

07:03.422 --> 07:05.258
Barry:
How's your food, John?

07:05.258 --> 07:08.344
Pretty good, right?
Chicken pot pie?

07:08.344 --> 07:11.472
- (dishes clinking)
- (door shuts)

07:11.472 --> 07:13.641
(footsteps approach)

07:14.267 --> 07:16.018
Barry (whispering):
You gotta stop
drinking at work.

07:16.018 --> 07:17.812
Sally (whispering):
I don't drink at work.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.564
Barry:
Sally, you came home drunk.

07:19.564 --> 07:22.316
Sally:
I know, but I didn't
drink at work.

07:22.316 --> 07:24.777
- (John sighs)
- Barry: Okay,
but it's gotta stop.

07:24.777 --> 07:27.321
- Sally: You drink beer.
- Barry: I'm throwing
the wine away.

07:27.321 --> 07:31.284
- Sally: You drink beer.
- Barry: Yeah, I drink beer,
and I know when to stop.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.954
Look, you're setting
a terrible example
for our son.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.498
- You understand?
- Sally: I'll stop when you stop.

07:37.498 --> 07:40.209
Barry:
I'm not horse trading
with you, okay?

07:40.209 --> 07:44.172
- (quiet rattling)
- Now, let's-- let's just try
to unwind with no drinks.

07:45.089 --> 07:46.674
Please?

07:47.466 --> 07:49.051
Please?

07:49.719 --> 07:52.013
Sally, don't answer me
with a look.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.933
- (insects chirping)
- (wind blowing)

07:57.185 --> 07:59.228
- (upbeat music on computer)
- Vlogger: <i>Hey, guys.
Today, I'm gonna tell you</i>

07:59.228 --> 08:01.647
<i>all the messed-up shit
Abraham Lincoln did</i>

08:01.647 --> 08:03.232
<i>that you'll never find
in history books.</i>

08:03.232 --> 08:06.611
<i>Number six
on today's countdown
of "Heroes Exposed"</i>

08:06.611 --> 08:08.446

08:08.446 --> 08:12.033
Actress (over headphones):
<i>I love Tom, and I think
I'm ready to get married.</i>

08:12.033 --> 08:13.367
Natalie:
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

08:13.367 --> 08:16.245
<i>Marriage is like a...</i>

08:16.245 --> 08:17.705
<i>package of jelly beans.</i>

08:17.705 --> 08:19.624
<i>At first, it's fantastic.</i>

08:19.624 --> 08:22.376
<i>Strawberry. Watermelon.
Grape?</i> (laughs)

08:22.376 --> 08:24.545
<i>And then one day,
you get black licorice,</i>

08:24.545 --> 08:26.505
<i>and you think to yourself,</i>

08:26.505 --> 08:28.257
<i>why did I get
these jelly beans?</i>

08:28.257 --> 08:30.718
<i>But, Mom, what if
I love black licorice?</i>

08:30.718 --> 08:34.055
<i>Honey, nobody likes
black licorice.</i>

08:34.055 --> 08:37.433
(audience laughter)

08:40.186 --> 08:42.313
Minister:
<i>The more you focus
on your pain,</i>

08:42.313 --> 08:44.524
<i>the more you focus
on your pity,</i>

08:44.524 --> 08:46.692
<i>the bigger it gets,</i>

08:46.692 --> 08:48.903
<i>and the more you doubt God.</i>

08:51.155 --> 08:52.990
<i>In moments like this,</i>

08:52.990 --> 08:55.785
<i>I think of Daniel
in the lion's den.</i>

08:56.827 --> 09:01.082
<i>If Daniel were
to focus on those lions,
how would he sleep?</i>

09:04.210 --> 09:06.295
<i>He wouldn't!</i> (laughs)

09:06.879 --> 09:10.466
<i>He'd be scared to death,
waitin' to be eaten alive!</i>

09:10.466 --> 09:12.551
<i>Now, how did he survive?</i>

09:13.094 --> 09:17.598
<i>He survived because
he focused
not on the lions,</i>

09:17.598 --> 09:19.267
<i>but God.</i>

09:20.268 --> 09:24.146
<i>See, you can't focus on
the pain, the pity, the fear.</i>

09:24.146 --> 09:27.858
<i>You focus on what
made those lions. God.</i>

09:29.151 --> 09:32.363
<i>- God will deliver us.</i>
- (Sally sighs)

09:33.281 --> 09:37.076
<i>God acts on behalf of those
who wait for him.</i>

09:40.204 --> 09:43.416
<i>God acts
on behalf of those...</i>

09:44.208 --> 09:45.876
<i>who wait for Him.</i>

09:48.754 --> 09:50.214
<i>Peace be with you.</i>

09:50.214 --> 09:52.341
Sally/Barry:
And also with you.

09:52.341 --> 09:54.468
<i>- Now, give thanks.</i>
- (acoustic guitar playing)

09:54.468 --> 09:57.722
<i>And may you go
in love and peace.</i>

09:57.722 --> 09:59.849
- Peace be with you.
- Peace be with you.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.685
- (applause)
- Buddy. Peace be with you, pal.

10:03.894 --> 10:06.605
Look at everything
God's given us, John.

10:06.605 --> 10:08.899
- It's beautiful.
- (wind blowing, birds chirping)

10:08.899 --> 10:10.568
We gotta honor it.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.695
- You know what I mean?
- John: Mm-hmm.

10:12.695 --> 10:15.573
Barry:
Gotta keep everything
on God's land safe.

10:16.198 --> 10:19.160
Everything from the ants
to the giant trees.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.538
- John: There's giant trees?
- Barry: Oh, yeah. It's nuts.

10:24.874 --> 10:27.543
You know, you gotta
honor humans.

10:27.543 --> 10:31.005
- You gotta honor Dad.
Dad's gotta honor you.
- (John chuckles)

10:31.005 --> 10:34.300
- John: What about Mom?
- Barry: Mom. Sure.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.010
Gotta honor Mom.

10:38.471 --> 10:41.766
- John: She cries a lot.
- Barry: Oh, yes. Yes, she does.

10:42.266 --> 10:44.935
But, you know what?
Like I've said...

10:45.394 --> 10:48.773
there's happy cry,
and then there's sad cry

10:49.231 --> 10:51.817
and then there's, uh...
Well, there's Mom cry,

10:51.817 --> 10:54.528
- and that can be
very loud and scary.
- (children laughing)

10:54.528 --> 10:57.031
I feel like I have
a pretty good way
of talking her down.

10:57.031 --> 10:59.241
As long as I'm calm,

10:59.241 --> 11:01.285
and I'm saying, you know,

11:01.285 --> 11:03.871
"You need to stop yelling
and you're spitting
when you talk."

11:03.871 --> 11:07.208
You know,
those are things...
(voice fading)

11:07.208 --> 11:09.960
Ah. So close.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.924
Alright.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.550
That was a pretty good throw.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.096
Thought you said you didn't
know how to play.

11:22.473 --> 11:23.766
You're gettin'
the hang of it.

11:23.766 --> 11:26.435
- Maybe a little wild,
but you got this.
- (John laughs)

11:28.521 --> 11:30.314
Oh yeah. There you go.
Now, you got this.

11:30.314 --> 11:32.108
(laughs) Yeah!

11:34.860 --> 11:36.570
Here, you can have this.

11:36.570 --> 11:39.323
You know,
you're good enough
to play right field.

11:39.323 --> 11:40.825
Yeah?

11:40.825 --> 11:44.120
Yeah, so next time
your Dad takes a nap,

11:44.120 --> 11:45.496
why don't you come on
over to my place,

11:45.496 --> 11:48.332
and I can show you how to hit?
It's not that hard.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.169
Okay. Thanks.

11:52.169 --> 11:53.379
All good.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.631
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

11:55.631 --> 11:59.009
Does your mom wear hair
on top of her own hair?

11:59.009 --> 12:02.054
(quiet rummaging)

12:02.054 --> 12:05.266
(plastic crinkling)

12:10.938 --> 12:12.356
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

12:12.356 --> 12:14.066
Did you get that comforter?

12:15.025 --> 12:17.194
- No.
- (plastic crinkling)

12:17.194 --> 12:19.196
My room's cold.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.449
(sighs)

12:21.449 --> 12:22.950
Listen, John,
do you know th-the story

12:22.950 --> 12:25.202
of the feeding
of the five thousand?

12:25.703 --> 12:28.622
See, wh-what happened was
Jesus was in the desert

12:28.622 --> 12:31.959
with a bunch of his buddies,
about 5,000 of them,

12:31.959 --> 12:33.752
and they were all hungry,

12:33.752 --> 12:37.506
and all they had
was a piece of fish
and a piece of bread.

12:37.506 --> 12:39.175
You know what Jesus did?

12:39.175 --> 12:42.553
He multiplied it all,
and he fed all of them.

12:45.222 --> 12:47.183
- So, you did get my comforter?
- No.

12:47.183 --> 12:48.851
No, th-the point of the story

12:48.851 --> 12:51.187
is that God gives you
exactly what you need.

12:52.980 --> 12:55.774
- And don't whine.
- (plastic crinkling)

12:56.525 --> 12:59.695
(sighs) Ooh!
My Lincoln book. Thank you.

13:00.529 --> 13:02.156

wanna get killed by a baseball.

17:08.318 --> 17:09.903
Impressive.

All I do at night

your mouth on my dick.

Hm. Okay.

I've been looking for this.

You were in war?

21:07.099 --> 21:09.309
I was gonna wait
to tell you this.

on the swing.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.148
Uh...

21:15.148 --> 21:16.858
Yeah. I was in war.

21:18.068 --> 21:19.695
I was a Marine.

21:20.696 --> 21:23.073
- A soldier?
- Yeah.

21:24.032 --> 21:26.159
Marines are the best soldiers.

21:27.536 --> 21:29.997
Some call me Marine.
Other people...

21:31.039 --> 21:32.207
Well, they call me a hero,

21:32.207 --> 21:34.501
but I don't like
putting labels on things.

21:36.878 --> 21:38.964
You wanna keep that
in your room?

21:39.506 --> 21:42.551
You know, I found out some,
uh, interesting information

21:42.551 --> 21:44.344
about our buddy Abe Lincoln.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.389
Turns out,

21:47.389 --> 21:49.808
he had a bunch of
Native Americans killed.

21:49.808 --> 21:52.019
Executed. Yeah.

21:53.562 --> 21:56.648
He also proposed
to Black people that
they go back to Africa.

21:56.648 --> 21:59.359
(blinds rattling)

21:59.359 --> 22:02.696
Got hundreds of men killed
at Shiloh and Antietam.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.991

22:05.991 --> 22:07.659
News to me.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.330
Saint Augustin?

22:12.998 --> 22:15.542

to bathhouses, John.

22:16.251 --> 22:19.171
Now, he's, what,
third-most googled saint?

22:19.171 --> 22:20.881
Something like that.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.343

22:25.677 --> 22:27.804

Gandhi?

22:29.222 --> 22:31.683
He, uh-- Wait. I read it.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.602
Gandhi, uh, what'd he do?

22:33.602 --> 22:35.562
- (lights click)
- Oh yeah.
His wife had pneumonia.

22:35.562 --> 22:37.564
Doctors said, "You gotta
give her penicillin,"

22:37.564 --> 22:39.816
but he said no because
of religious beliefs.

22:39.816 --> 22:43.195
But then, when he got malaria,
he said, "Give me the drugs."

22:43.195 --> 22:44.905
Tricky.

22:44.905 --> 22:46.948

I'm sorry.
I didn't know what to do.

26:24.916 --> 26:27.252
- It's fine. Where is he?
- He's over there.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.088
Okay.

26:34.968 --> 26:37.595
- He said he's Gene Cousineau?
- That's what he said.

26:37.595 --> 26:39.848
- Did he show you ID?
- He didn't have any.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.808
He didn't come in a car.
He walked up.

27:08.752 --> 27:11.546
I've been out of the country
a long time.

27:12.130 --> 27:14.466
Okay. And who did you
wanna speak with?

27:14.799 --> 27:18.011
I'd like to talk to the person
who runs Warner Brothers.

27:18.011 --> 27:19.679
Okay. About what?

27:19.971 --> 27:22.557
Something that's come
to my attention recently.

27:22.557 --> 27:24.017
And what's that?

27:24.267 --> 27:26.353
I would rather talk to him.

27:26.353 --> 27:28.813
Well, I work for him,
so I think you'll
need to tell me,

27:28.813 --> 27:32.734
- and I'll relay it to him.
- Gene: I would feel more
comfortable talking to him.

27:34.569 --> 27:35.820
Well, I can't do that.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.030
Why?

27:37.030 --> 27:38.698
Because I don't think
you're Gene Cousineau.

27:38.698 --> 27:40.116
Why?

27:40.116 --> 27:43.370
Because he's been missing,
presumed dead, for eight years.

27:44.287 --> 27:47.665
If you're planning what
I think you're planning,

27:47.665 --> 27:50.919
you're gonna
want to talk to me.

27:54.631 --> 27:56.758
(sighs) Keep him here.

28:01.179 --> 28:02.931
(lights buzzing)

28:02.931 --> 28:05.266
Clean livin'.
My whole life

28:05.266 --> 28:08.186
has been a testament
to clean livin'.

28:09.270 --> 28:12.148
I never touched the alcohol,

28:12.148 --> 28:14.359
the drugs, crappy food.

28:15.652 --> 28:17.695
(scoffs)
Hell, I've been married
to the same woman

28:17.695 --> 28:21.282
since I was 18.
Years of clean living.

28:21.282 --> 28:24.536
You'd think I'd be able to
judge people correctly, right?

28:25.286 --> 28:26.496
Yeah.

28:26.913 --> 28:29.416
Well, I thank you, Emily.

28:29.416 --> 28:32.252
Oh, hey,
that's no problem.

28:33.837 --> 28:35.547
You're a very brave woman.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.007
Most people turn a blind eye,

28:38.007 --> 28:40.468
especially with a punk
like Bevel.

28:40.468 --> 28:43.346
(helicopter flying overhead)

28:43.346 --> 28:44.597
I think what took me in

28:44.597 --> 28:47.392
was how much
he reminded me
of my grandson.

28:49.686 --> 28:51.604
I thought some honest work

28:51.604 --> 28:54.399
would show him
the joys of clean livin'.

28:54.399 --> 28:57.235
- And then--
- He steals from you.

28:57.235 --> 28:59.612
Till tappin' little bastard.

28:59.612 --> 29:01.156
Sally:
Mm-hmm.

29:01.156 --> 29:04.951
(sighs)
Well, you two are angels.

29:06.661 --> 29:08.788
I'll find a replacement soon.

29:10.832 --> 29:14.127
- (door opens)
- (sighs, laughs)

29:14.127 --> 29:17.005
- I'm not surprised.
- (door shuts)

29:17.005 --> 29:19.340
I've thought about
tapping the till.

29:20.717 --> 29:23.636
But I got such
a guilty conscious.

29:24.429 --> 29:27.223
Probably just end up
blowin' my fuckin' brains out.

29:29.142 --> 29:32.228
Host:
<i>In honor of the finale
of "Just Desserts,"</i>

29:32.228 --> 29:34.647
<i>we sit down
with Natalie Greer,</i>

29:34.647 --> 29:38.860
<i>the mind behind a show
that defined a generation.</i>

29:41.362 --> 29:43.656
So, we were on patrol,

29:43.656 --> 29:46.242
and we came to this village
and two elders were arguing over

29:46.242 --> 29:47.952
who killed
the other person's donkey,

29:47.952 --> 29:51.664
which was a typical occurrence
over there.

29:51.664 --> 29:54.292
And then, uh, a shot rang out.

29:54.292 --> 29:55.710
(John gasps)

29:55.710 --> 29:58.379
- And do you know who was shot?
- Who?

29:59.672 --> 30:01.341
Albert.

30:01.341 --> 30:04.052
- Your best friend?
- Yeah.

30:04.052 --> 30:05.386
(Barry sighs)

30:05.386 --> 30:07.680
And I heard them shout my name.

30:07.680 --> 30:11.392
"Medic! Medic! Get up here!"

30:11.392 --> 30:12.936
So, I ran up there,
and when I found him,

30:12.936 --> 30:15.230
he was all messed up.
He looked terrible.

30:16.189 --> 30:18.066
And they told me, they said,
"Clark, he's a goner."

30:18.066 --> 30:19.984
And I said,

30:19.984 --> 30:21.694
"Not on my watch."

30:22.612 --> 30:24.239
And I patched him up.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.116
And I saved his life.

30:27.825 --> 30:29.911
Did you kill the guys
who shot him?

30:29.911 --> 30:32.956
No, no, no.

30:32.956 --> 30:35.250
No, my job was
to protect our boys.

30:36.918 --> 30:39.170
Just like
I'm protecting you, John.

30:40.338 --> 30:41.965
(Barry sighs)

30:43.049 --> 30:45.593
- I love you so much, Dad.
- Oh...

30:45.593 --> 30:47.262
I love you, too.

30:48.137 --> 30:49.806
I love you too, buddy.

30:51.349 --> 30:54.018
<i>But it's just so crazy
to have gone</i>

30:54.018 --> 30:56.271
<i>from, like, being
a chubby little kid</i>

30:56.271 --> 30:58.565
<i>who loves cupcakes to then,
all of a sudden,</i>

30:58.565 --> 31:00.900
<i>you know, the President
of the United States</i>

31:00.900 --> 31:04.320
<i>is quoting our show at
the State of the Union.</i>

31:04.320 --> 31:06.781
<i>Like, how did--
how did we get
this lucky, you know?</i>

31:06.781 --> 31:09.784
<i>- Like, we're so lucky.</i>
- (sighs)

31:09.784 --> 31:12.203
<i>Do you know that we almost
fired you season two?</i>

31:12.203 --> 31:13.746
- (notification chimes)
- (laughs) <i>Really?</i>

31:13.746 --> 31:16.457
<i>Yes! Because you weren't
good yet, you know?</i>

31:16.457 --> 31:19.794
<i>- Y-You were a kid,
so you were bad, but...</i>
- (laughs)

31:19.794 --> 31:21.504
Sally:
Barry!

31:22.505 --> 31:25.300
- Who's Barry?
- Shh.

31:27.844 --> 31:29.971
- What?
- (heavy breathing)

31:32.849 --> 31:35.101
Sally:
They're making
a movie about us.

31:36.561 --> 31:39.022
(heavy breathing)

31:42.233 --> 31:45.528
I'm gonna have to
kill Cousineau.
