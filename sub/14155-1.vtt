00:03.033 --> 00:06.000
[music playing]

00:06.033 --> 00:14.033
*

00:28.900 --> 00:31.633
- PARDON ME, BUT SOMEONE
NEEDS TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE

00:31.667 --> 00:33.200
BETWEEN ONE MAN SAYING,

00:33.233 --> 00:36.233
"WHEN I GET THAT FEELING,
I WANT SEXUAL HEALING,"

00:36.267 --> 00:39.067
AND ANOTHER ONE SAYING,
"I WANNA LICK, LICK, LICK YOU

00:39.100 --> 00:40.567
"FROM YOUR HEAD TO
YOUR TOES,

00:40.600 --> 00:43.300
THEN MOVE FROM
THE BED DOWN TO THE FLOOR."

00:43.333 --> 00:46.400
- THE DIFFERENCE IS MARVIN GAYE
KNEW HOW TO WRITE A SONG

00:46.433 --> 00:47.867
THAT MADE
A WOMAN FEEL SPECIAL.

00:47.900 --> 00:50.133
LIKE SHE WAS
THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE WORLD.

00:50.167 --> 00:51.700
- THAT'S RIGHT.

00:51.733 --> 00:54.400
MARVIN...HE COULD GET IT.
I MEAN, ALL OF IT.

00:54.433 --> 00:56.967
- OH, SAM COOKE AND
TEDDY PENDERGRASS TOO, GIRL.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.200
ALL OF IT.
- BABY, WE GET IT.

00:59.233 --> 01:01.567
YOU LIKE DARK MEAT.
BUT FUNDAMENTALLY,

01:01.600 --> 01:03.967
THEIR MESSAGE IS THE SAME.
MEN ARE MEN.

01:04.067 --> 01:06.433
- THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THE WAY
THEY'RE ASKING FOR THAT ASS.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.267
- MARVIN WAS A GENIUS.

01:08.300 --> 01:10.133
ALL RIGHT, HE MADE
WOMEN FEEL POWERFUL,

01:10.167 --> 01:11.967
LIKE THEY CAN HEAL THEM
WITH THEIR SEX.

01:12.067 --> 01:14.167
LUDA'S JUST HONEST,
HE JUST WANNA HIT IT.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.067
- SEE, ONE WAY
IS ACCEPTABLE NASTY.

01:16.067 --> 01:17.433
THE OTHER WAY,
JUST NASTY.

01:17.467 --> 01:19.100
- NOW PRINCE...
- YES.

01:19.133 --> 01:20.933
- HE HAD AN ARTFUL WAY
OF GETTING A WOMAN INTO BED.

01:20.967 --> 01:23.167
- HOLD ON A SECOND,
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT SAYING

01:23.200 --> 01:25.300
PRINCE IS ROMANTIC.
- HELL YEAH!

01:25.333 --> 01:27.933
ADORE, THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
GIRL IN THE WORLD,

01:27.967 --> 01:29.333
NOTHING COMPARES 2 U?

01:29.367 --> 01:31.800
- DARLING, NIKKI,
SOFT AND WET?

01:31.833 --> 01:33.133
DO ME, BABY?

01:33.167 --> 01:34.767
I'M SORRY,
BUT YOUR BOY JUST NASTY.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.600
- NO, HE'S ACCEPTABLE NASTY.

01:36.633 --> 01:38.700
NOW R. KELLY?
all: JUST NASTY.

01:38.733 --> 01:40.767
- [chuckles]
- THE PROBLEM IS,

01:40.800 --> 01:42.667
MEN DON'T WANNA DATE ANYMORE.
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW.

01:42.700 --> 01:44.200
- THAT'S WHY I GIVE THEM
A TASTE OF THEIR OWN MEDICINE

01:44.233 --> 01:45.333
TO KEEP IT MOVING.
- EXCUSE ME?

01:45.367 --> 01:47.333
- OH.
NOT WITH YOU, BABY.

01:47.367 --> 01:48.967
- LOOK, IT'S NOT JUST
MEN THAT ARE FREAKS, OKAY?

01:49.067 --> 01:50.367
WOMEN ARE FREAKS TOO.
- YEAH.

01:50.400 --> 01:52.067
- BABY, JUST BECAUSE
A WOMAN KNOWS INSTANTLY

01:52.067 --> 01:53.867
WHETHER SHE'S GOING
TO SLEEP WITH A MAN OR NOT

01:53.900 --> 01:55.867
DOESN'T MEAN SHE DOESN'T
WANNA BE ROMANCED FOR A WHILE

01:55.900 --> 01:57.867
BEFORE SHE GIVES HIM
THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM.

01:57.900 --> 02:01.200
- OKAY, SO FOR THE FIRST
THREE MONTHS YOU HAD ME BEGGING

02:01.233 --> 02:02.767
WHEN YOU ALREADY KNEW
YOU WERE GONNA LET ME TAP IT?

02:02.800 --> 02:04.100
- DAMN STRAIGHT.

02:04.133 --> 02:06.800
YOU GOTTA WAIT 90 DAYS
TO TAP THIS.

02:06.833 --> 02:09.167
I WAS RAISED A LADY.
- SO THAT KINDA MAKES SENSE,

02:09.200 --> 02:10.567
BECAUSE A GUY KNOWS
IN THE FIRST 15 MINUTES

02:10.600 --> 02:11.967
OF SPENDING TIME
WITH A WOMAN

02:12.067 --> 02:13.433
WHETHER OR NOT
HE'D EVER MARRY HER.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.167
- NOW THAT'S TRUE.
'CAUSE EVEN WITH

02:15.200 --> 02:18.433
ALL THAT HAIRSPRAY AND THOSE
RIPPED UP FISHNET STOCKINGS,

02:18.467 --> 02:20.100
I KNEW I WAS
GONNA PROPOSE TO YOU.

02:20.133 --> 02:22.067
- I MET KEISHA TWO WEEKS AGO.

02:22.067 --> 02:24.433
AND I KNEW INSTANTLY
THAT WE HAD SOMETHING SPECIAL,

02:24.467 --> 02:26.633
SOMETHING JUST...NASTY.

02:26.667 --> 02:28.333
- 'CAUSE I'M GLAD
YOU GOT THAT STRAIGHT,

02:28.367 --> 02:29.933
BECAUSE YOU'RE
TOO BROKE TO MARRY ME.

02:29.967 --> 02:31.967
- AND THAT'S OKAY.
'CAUSE WE BOTH KNOW

02:32.067 --> 02:34.433
WHEN YOU DIGGIN' IN MY POCKETS
YOU AIN'T LOOKING FOR CHANGE.

02:34.467 --> 02:35.767
both: [giggling]
- WHAT ABOUT YOU,

02:35.800 --> 02:38.067
MR. ATLANTA DUNKS MVP,
HUH?

02:38.100 --> 02:39.433
ALL THEM HONEYS
AROUND YOU, MAN.

02:39.467 --> 02:41.133
WHEN DID YOU KNOW
YOU WAS GONNA MARRY VAL?

02:45.367 --> 02:47.267
Y'ALL AIN'T MARRIED, HUH?

02:48.967 --> 02:50.600
MY BAD.
[chuckles]

02:50.633 --> 02:52.300
SEE, YOU SAID Y'ALL BEEN
TOGETHER FOR, LIKE, FIVE YEARS.

02:52.333 --> 02:53.933
WHAT YOU WAITING ON, MAN?
- [clears throat]

02:53.967 --> 02:55.467
- I SHOULD
STOP TALKING NOW, HUH?

02:55.500 --> 02:57.333
- YOU THINK?
- NO, KEISH...

02:57.367 --> 03:00.400
IT'S A VALID QUESTION.
WHY NOT GET A VALID ANSWER?

03:00.433 --> 03:02.067
QUINN?

03:02.100 --> 03:03.533
- EXCUSE ME.

03:03.567 --> 03:05.600
- YOU GUYS READY
TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT?

03:05.633 --> 03:06.767
- IN A SEC, APRIL.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.600
- OKAY.

03:08.633 --> 03:09.633
- QUINN?

03:09.667 --> 03:11.267
- COME ON, BABY.

03:11.300 --> 03:13.200
LOOK, CAN WE PLEASE CELEBRATE
THAT YOU JUST BOUGHT

03:13.233 --> 03:14.767
YOUR VERY OWN
CLOTHING STORE, HUH?

03:14.800 --> 03:16.300
TO VAL, EVERYBODY.
- WHOO!

03:16.333 --> 03:18.433
[overlapping cheers]

03:19.900 --> 03:22.733
- [sighs]

03:25.267 --> 03:27.967
- VAL, BABY, COME ON.
DON'T DO THIS RIGHT NOW.

03:28.067 --> 03:30.100
- DON'T DO WHAT?

03:30.133 --> 03:32.267
WONDER ABOUT MY FUTURE?

03:32.300 --> 03:33.600
ABOUT WHERE THIS IS GOING?

03:33.633 --> 03:35.567
- WHERE IT'S GOING?

03:35.600 --> 03:37.533
COME ON, BABY,
LIVE IN THE PRESENT.

03:37.567 --> 03:39.133
WE'RE STILL TOGETHER,
AREN'T WE?

03:39.167 --> 03:41.400
- YEAH, BUT YOU'D THINK
AFTER FIVE YEARS,

03:41.433 --> 03:43.300
YOU'D WANNA TAKE IT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

03:43.333 --> 03:46.267
I'M TIRED OF MAKING UP
EXCUSES TO MY PARENTS,

03:46.300 --> 03:47.567
AND TO EVERYONE ELSE
FOR THAT MATTER,

03:47.600 --> 03:49.600
AS TO WHY
I'M NOT MARRIED YET.

03:49.633 --> 03:52.067
IT'S EMBARRASSING.
LIKE RIGHT NOW.

03:52.100 --> 03:53.267
- OH, COME ON,
DAMN THE EMBARRASSMENT.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.633
BABY, WHY YOU KEEP TRYING

03:54.667 --> 03:56.367
TO FIX SOMETHING
THAT'S NOT BROKEN, HUH?

03:56.400 --> 03:58.400
WE'RE GOOD.
AND YOUR CAREER'S POPPIN'.

03:58.433 --> 04:00.067
AIN'T THAT
A REASON TO BE HAPPY?

04:00.067 --> 04:02.533
- I DID NOT
STOP STYLING FULL-TIME,

04:02.567 --> 04:04.433
HAND OFF ALL
MY A-LIST CLIENTS,

04:04.467 --> 04:06.833
TAKE OUT LOANS FOR A STORE
FOR ME!

04:06.867 --> 04:09.067
I MADE THAT CHOICE
FOR BOTH OF US.

04:09.067 --> 04:12.567
- OKAY, KEY WORDS...
YOU MADE THAT CHOICE.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.667
YOU'RE LIVING OUT OF HOTELS,
ALWAYS ON SOME WORLD TOUR

04:15.700 --> 04:17.833
WITH USHER, OR BEYONCE,
OR SOMEBODY.

04:17.867 --> 04:21.267
LOOK, I JUST SUGGESTED
THAT YOU OPEN UP YOUR OWN SPOT

04:21.300 --> 04:23.767
RIGHT HERE AT HOME
SO THAT YOU CAN BE MORE STABLE.

04:23.800 --> 04:24.933
YOU AGREED.

04:24.967 --> 04:26.867
- I COMPROMISED.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.533
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO WANTED ME HERE,

04:28.567 --> 04:30.533
NEXT TO YOU WHEN
YOU WEREN'T ON THE ROAD.

04:30.567 --> 04:32.933
YOU KNOW?
LIKE A WIFE.

04:32.967 --> 04:36.067
I ASSUMED MORE STABILITY
MEANT MARRIAGE.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.333
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE!

04:37.367 --> 04:38.867
- ARE YOU DONE MAKING
A SCENE?

04:40.633 --> 04:42.267
- WOW.

04:42.300 --> 04:44.067
- WOW WHAT, VAL?

04:44.100 --> 04:45.900
- I AM SUCH A FOOL.

04:45.933 --> 04:48.167
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S TAKEN ME
THIS LONG TO REALIZE IT.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.467
- HERE WE GO WITH
THE DRAMATICS.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.067
CAN'T WE
JUST HAVE A GOOD TIME?

04:51.100 --> 04:52.900
- "JUST HAVE A GOOD TIME, VAL."

04:52.933 --> 04:54.933
"JUST GO WITH THE FLOW, VAL."

04:54.967 --> 04:56.800
"IF IT'S NOT BROKE,
DON'T FIX IT, VAL."

04:56.833 --> 04:59.067
YOU ALWAYS
HAVE AN ANSWER FOR ME.

04:59.067 --> 05:00.733
BUT IT'S
NEVER THE RIGHT ONE.

05:00.767 --> 05:02.600
- OKAY, WELL YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF YOU AIN'T HAPPY,

05:02.633 --> 05:05.633
THEN YOU NEED TO--
- THEN WHAT?

05:05.667 --> 05:07.767
- THEN LEAVE.

05:07.800 --> 05:09.700
GO!

05:09.733 --> 05:12.067
I'M NOT HOLDING YOU PRISONER.
YOU'RE A GROWN-ASS WOMAN.

05:12.100 --> 05:13.600
- THAT WOULD LET YOU
OFF THE HOOK, WOULDN'T IT?

05:13.633 --> 05:15.567
THEN IT WOULD
ALL FALL ON ME.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.067
I DON'T THINK SO.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.933
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

05:18.967 --> 05:20.633
HOW ABOUT
I THROW YOU THE BALL,

05:20.667 --> 05:23.100
AND YOU CHOOSE WHETHER
TO RUN WITH IT OR DROP IT?

05:23.133 --> 05:24.900
- OKAY, WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT NOW?

05:24.933 --> 05:26.967
- I'M SAYING IF YOU LIKE IT,
THEN PUT A RING ON IT.

05:27.067 --> 05:29.067
IF NOT, LET'S STOP
WASTING EACH OTHER'S TIME.

05:29.067 --> 05:30.567
LIFE IS TOO SHORT.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.433
- YOU'RE SERIOUSLY
GIVING ME AN ULTIMATUM?

05:32.467 --> 05:34.133
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW?

05:35.600 --> 05:38.300
- YEAH.
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.200
- OKAY, GUYS...

05:42.233 --> 05:44.067
LET'S NOT GET STUPID.

05:44.067 --> 05:45.567
- YEAH, WHY DON'T
WE ALL SAY GOOD-NIGHT

05:45.600 --> 05:47.400
SO THESE TWO
CAN WORK IT OUT?

05:47.433 --> 05:49.700
- YEAH, YOU GUYS
JUST NEED TO CALM DOWN

05:49.733 --> 05:51.900
BEFORE THIS GETS BLOWN
EVEN MORE OUT OF PROPORTION.

05:51.933 --> 05:53.600
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:53.633 --> 05:56.467
YOU GUYS CAN STAY.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.233
I'M OUT.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.067
- COME ON, MAN.

06:01.067 --> 06:03.433
THINK.

06:03.467 --> 06:07.100
QUINN, DON'T DO
SOMETHING YOU MIGHT REGRET.

06:09.200 --> 06:12.067
- IT'S TOO LATE.

06:12.067 --> 06:14.500
[door slams]

06:14.533 --> 06:16.667
- OKAY, WHAT THE HELL
JUST HAPPENED?

06:16.700 --> 06:20.267
- I JUST
BECAME A SINGLE WOMAN.

06:20.300 --> 06:22.267
[door opens]

06:35.133 --> 06:37.133
[door closes]

06:42.867 --> 06:45.833
[music playing]

06:45.867 --> 06:53.867
*

06:59.567 --> 07:01.500
- OH, YEAH, MY NECK.

07:01.533 --> 07:02.800
[moans]
YEAH.

07:02.833 --> 07:04.833
[moans]

07:04.867 --> 07:06.467
- OH!

07:06.500 --> 07:08.267
[moaning]

07:08.300 --> 07:10.800
- BABY, OH.
[chuckles]

07:10.833 --> 07:12.400
- OOH!
- I LIKE IT LIKE THAT.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.900
WE GOT
SOMETHING SPECIAL, BABY.

07:14.933 --> 07:17.667
- [sighs]

07:17.700 --> 07:19.533
- OH, MAN.

07:29.067 --> 07:31.300
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:31.333 --> 07:33.233
- GOING TO SLEEP.

07:33.267 --> 07:34.800
- NO, BABY.
NOT HERE YOU'RE NOT.

07:34.833 --> 07:36.567
YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE--
- YEAH, YEAH.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.467
YOU DON'T LIKE IT WHEN
SOMEBODY WAKES UP NEXT TO YOU.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.733
I REMEMBER.
BUT IT'S 4:00 IN THE MORNING,

07:40.767 --> 07:43.767
AND I JUST PUT IN WORK.

07:46.433 --> 07:49.967
- [clears throat]

07:50.067 --> 07:51.100
- IS THIS BECAUSE I STARTED

07:51.133 --> 07:52.367
THAT DRAMA
BETWEEN VAL AND QUINN?

07:52.400 --> 07:54.100
'CAUSE
I ALREADY APOLOGIZED.

07:54.133 --> 07:55.267
- BYE, WOODY.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.767
- [sighs]
- I'LL CALL YOU.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.200
- YOU DO REALIZE
I DON'T HAVE A CAR?

07:59.233 --> 08:00.800
- OH, PLEASE
DON'T REMIND ME OF THAT

08:00.833 --> 08:02.100
AFTER I JUST
GAVE YOU SOME.

08:02.133 --> 08:04.167
CABS ARE EASY
TO FIND AROUND HERE.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.400
- KEISH!
I LIVE 30 MINUTES AWAY.

08:07.633 --> 08:09.667
COME ON, MA.
STOP TRIPPIN'.

08:09.700 --> 08:12.933
LET'S COME ON
AND GET SOME SLEEP.

08:12.967 --> 08:15.533
YO...
LOUIS, MAN.

08:16.700 --> 08:18.167
OH...

08:18.200 --> 08:21.767
SO...I'M A LITTLE SHORT
ON PAPER.

08:29.433 --> 08:31.667
- YOU'RE LUCKY
YOU GOT ALL THIS.

08:31.700 --> 08:33.700
- MM.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.933
MM.

08:36.967 --> 08:39.733
SO I WAS--WAIT, OKAY.
- BYE.

08:39.767 --> 08:43.400
[phone ringing]

08:45.200 --> 08:46.733
- [sighs]

08:46.767 --> 08:48.433
OKAY, NOW YOU'RE
STARTING TO WORK MY NERVE.

08:48.467 --> 08:49.733
NO MEANS NO.

08:49.767 --> 08:52.067
- WELL, DAMN.

08:52.067 --> 08:53.867
IS THAT WHAT I GET FOR
NOT CALLING FOR THREE DAYS?

08:53.900 --> 08:56.733
- MALCOLM FRANKS.
WELL, WELL, WELL.

08:56.767 --> 08:58.167
AND IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS.

08:58.200 --> 08:59.867
BUT WHO'S COUNTING?

08:59.900 --> 09:03.200
- SO WHAT'S THIS...
THIS LUCKY GUY'S NAME?

09:03.233 --> 09:04.800
- WOODY.

09:04.833 --> 09:06.200
REAL CUTE, TOO.

09:06.233 --> 09:08.067
I CAN'T WAIT AROUND
FOR YOUR CALL.

09:08.067 --> 09:10.367
- OH, I HAVE NO DOUBT
YOU STAY BUSY, KEISHA.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.400
WE BOTH
HAVE THAT IN COMMON.

09:12.433 --> 09:14.067
- MISS ME YET?

09:15.700 --> 09:17.800
- I WANNA SEE YOU TONIGHT.

09:17.833 --> 09:19.667
DOES THAT
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION?

09:19.700 --> 09:22.067
- MALCOLM, I WOULD NOT BE ONE
OF YOUR BOOTY CALLS.

09:22.067 --> 09:24.067
I'M HEADED TO BED.

09:24.100 --> 09:25.900
- WELL, THEN HAVE DINNER
WITH ME TOMORROW NIGHT.

09:25.933 --> 09:28.167
- YOU THINK YOU CAN
JUST CALL ME OUTTA THE BLUE

09:28.200 --> 09:29.367
AND I'LL BE AVAILABLE?

09:29.400 --> 09:31.067
- I'LL PICK YOU UP.

09:31.100 --> 09:34.567
WEAR SOMETHING SEXY.

09:34.600 --> 09:37.233
SOMETHING RED.

09:37.267 --> 09:39.867
- YOU ALWAYS WANT ME
TO WEAR SOMETHING RED.

09:39.900 --> 09:41.700
I LIKE WHITE.

09:41.733 --> 09:43.233
AND I'LL BE READY AT 8:00.

09:43.267 --> 09:44.533
- LET'S MAKE IT 9:00.

09:44.567 --> 09:46.500
- DOES IT ALWAYS
HAVE TO BE ABOUT YOU?

09:46.533 --> 09:48.200
- IF YOU ALWAYS MAKE IT
ABOUT ME, KEISHA,

09:48.233 --> 09:51.067
YOU WILL NEVER GO WRONG.

09:51.067 --> 09:52.233
- GOOD NIGHT.

09:56.067 --> 09:58.967
[music playing]

09:59.067 --> 10:07.000
*

10:13.833 --> 10:16.733
- BOSS SEES YOU,
THAT'S YOUR ASS.

10:16.767 --> 10:19.667
- VAL KNOWS I'M NOT CUT OUT
TO WORK 20 HOURS A DAY LIKE HER.

10:19.700 --> 10:21.400
- YOU'RE NOT CUT OUT
TO WORK, PERIOD.

10:21.433 --> 10:23.300
- [scoffs]
THANK YOU!

10:23.333 --> 10:26.467
I NEED A RICH MAN TO
BRING HOME THE IMPORTED BACON

10:26.500 --> 10:29.333
AND HAVE OUR CHEF FRY IT UP
IN A NEIMAN MARCUS PAN.

10:29.367 --> 10:30.700
- YOU BETTER HAVE
A RICH MAN.

10:30.733 --> 10:32.033
- MM-HMM.
- 'CAUSE WE BOTH KNOW

10:32.067 --> 10:34.300
YOU HAVEN'T
SAVED A DIME, AND...

10:34.333 --> 10:37.133
THAT BOOTY AIN'T BOUNCIN'
LIKE IT USED TO, EITHER.

10:37.167 --> 10:38.700
YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE SAYING
KEISHA GREENE DIDN'T

10:38.733 --> 10:40.400
KNOW WHEN TO QUIT, DO YOU?
[light spank]

10:40.433 --> 10:42.333
- [gasps, chuckles]
DON'T GET IT TWISTED.

10:42.367 --> 10:44.733
THE BOOTY...
IT STILL BOUNCE.

10:44.767 --> 10:46.300
BUT THE CHECKS NEVER DO.

10:46.333 --> 10:49.033
AND AS FAR AS VIDEOS?
BEEN THERE, DONE THAT.

10:49.067 --> 10:51.800
I'VE MOVED ON.
I'M REINVENTING MYSELF.

10:51.833 --> 10:55.400
- AND YET, SOMEHOW YOU'RE
STILL GONNA DO CAM'RON'S VIDEO.

10:55.433 --> 10:57.767
SO YOU'RE REINVENTING,
AND HE'S, WHAT?

10:57.800 --> 10:59.633
RECYCLING?

11:00.867 --> 11:01.967
- OOH,
YOU BETTER RUN, BITCH.

11:02.067 --> 11:03.767
- [sighs]
YOU KNOW,

11:03.800 --> 11:05.533
THESE CLOTHES AREN'T GONNA
HANG THEMSELVES.

11:05.567 --> 11:08.267
COME ON, GUYS,
THE GRAND OPENING IS THIS WEEK.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.933
AND WHEN I SAY "GUYS,"
I MEAN "KEISHA."

11:10.967 --> 11:13.067
[sighs]
- [scoffs]

11:13.100 --> 11:15.200
JEEZ.

11:20.067 --> 11:21.700
- EVE!
HI!

11:21.733 --> 11:23.767
- HI.
- I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE

11:23.800 --> 11:25.700
COMING BY TODAY.
YOU CAN'T SEE IT LIKE THIS.

11:25.733 --> 11:27.200
WE'RE NOT READY.
- UM...

11:27.233 --> 11:28.867
THAT IS NO WAY TO
TREAT YOUR ONLY INVESTOR.

11:28.900 --> 11:30.700
I GUESS I WILL
TAKE THIS LAST CHECK

11:30.733 --> 11:32.267
AND COME BACK
WHEN YOU'RE READY FOR IT.

11:32.300 --> 11:33.900
- OH, NO, NO, NO.
YOU'RE RIGHT, STAY.

11:33.933 --> 11:36.700
LOOK AROUND, SEE HOW
YOUR MONEY IS BEING WELL-SPENT.

11:36.733 --> 11:38.900
IN FACT, I AM THREE MONTHS
AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.

11:38.933 --> 11:40.400
[gasps]
NO, NO, NO, NO!

11:40.433 --> 11:41.667
NOT THAT WALL.

11:41.700 --> 11:44.067
OKAY, JUST
GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES.

11:45.700 --> 11:47.600
- SHE WAS GOOD WHEN
SHE WAS WORKING FOR ME,

11:47.633 --> 11:49.767
BUT NOT THREE MONTHS
AHEAD OF SCHEDULE GOOD.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.700
UM, WHAT IS SHE
PUTTING IN HER COFFEE?

11:51.733 --> 11:54.333
- IT AIN'T THE COFFEE.
IT'S THE BREAK-UP.

11:54.367 --> 11:55.833
HOMEBOY QUIT HER
AT HER OWN PARTY

11:55.867 --> 11:57.367
IN FRONT OF
ALL OF HER FRIENDS.

11:57.400 --> 12:00.267
BRUTAL.
- YEAH, HE JACKED MY GIRL UP.

12:00.300 --> 12:01.833
AFTER SITTING
IN THE DARK FOR A WEEK,

12:01.867 --> 12:03.300
SHE BURIED HERSELF
IN THIS BOUTIQUE

12:03.333 --> 12:04.800
AND HASN'T STOPPED
FOR A SECOND.

12:04.833 --> 12:06.367
THAT'S
WHY I DON'T DO LOVE.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.900
MM-MM.
- AMEN.

12:07.933 --> 12:09.633
- [chuckles]
THANK YOU, TMZ.

12:09.667 --> 12:12.367
REMIND ME TO NEVER LET
ANYTHING PERSONAL

12:12.400 --> 12:14.900
HAPPEN AROUND YOU TWO.

12:14.933 --> 12:17.400
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M ACTUALLY GLAD YOU CAME BY.

12:17.433 --> 12:19.300
BECAUSE WE CAN
USE THE EXTRA SET OF ARMS

12:19.333 --> 12:20.700
TO HELP US MOVE THESE BOXES.

12:20.733 --> 12:22.733
- OOH, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I WOULD,

12:22.767 --> 12:25.633
BUT EVER SINCE
I WROTE YOU THAT BIG OL' CHECK,

12:25.667 --> 12:27.467
MY WRIST HAS BEEN ACTING UP.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.767
- RIGHT.
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

12:38.233 --> 12:39.800
- HEY.
- HEY.

12:39.833 --> 12:42.467
YOU READY TO
TAKE OUR FRIEND BACK?

12:42.500 --> 12:45.067
- [chuckles]

12:45.067 --> 12:46.667
- THAT'S GOOD.
- ABOUT THIS.

12:46.700 --> 12:47.900
- NO.
- YEAH.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.567
- STOP IT, NO.
I HAVE TO FINISH!

12:49.600 --> 12:51.067
- YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE,
LET'S GO.

12:51.067 --> 12:52.833
- MAKE SURE
YOU PUT THAT OVER THERE.

12:52.867 --> 12:56.500
[all giggle]

13:01.300 --> 13:03.767
- OHH.
ADMIT IT.

13:03.800 --> 13:04.833
YOU NEEDED THIS TIME OUT.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.633
- OKAY.
I ADMIT IT.

13:06.667 --> 13:10.700
I HAVE BEEN CAUGHT UP IN MY
OWN LITTLE WORLD EVER SINCE...

13:10.733 --> 13:12.867
WELL, EVER SINCE...

13:12.900 --> 13:14.667
- VAL, I HAVE NOT
SEEN YOU SHED ONE TEAR.

13:14.700 --> 13:16.767
- I GAVE QUINN FIVE YEARS.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.633
I AM NOT
GIVING HIM ANOTHER TEAR.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.433
- THAT'S RIGHT.
MAN UP AND STAY UP.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.067
- IT'S CRAZY, 'CAUSE I HAD
THE WHOLE THING PLANNED.

13:23.067 --> 13:27.700
WE WERE GONNA GET MARRIED,
HAVE CHILDREN, GROW OLD.

13:27.733 --> 13:29.433
AND NOW I HAVE
TO START ALL OVER.

13:29.467 --> 13:31.200
FALL IN LOVE
WITH A WHOLE NEW MAN.

13:31.233 --> 13:33.300
- SIX BILLION PEOPLE
ON THE PLANET,

13:33.333 --> 13:35.600
AND WOMEN FEEL
WE NEED TO FIND ONE MAN?

13:35.633 --> 13:39.833
VAL, DO YOU USE ONE SUPPLY
FOR YOUR STORE? NO.

13:39.867 --> 13:41.700
SO RUN YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
LIKE YOU RUN YOUR BUSINESS.

13:41.733 --> 13:43.500
USE YOUR HEAD
NOT YOUR HEART.

13:43.533 --> 13:45.667
- KEISHA, YOU KNOW ME.
I BELIEVE IN SOUL MATES.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.267
- [scoffs]
- HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

13:47.300 --> 13:48.500
- [scoffs]
- TRUE LOVE.

13:48.533 --> 13:51.067
- IF YOU WANT TRUE LOVE,
BUY A PUPPY.

13:51.067 --> 13:52.967
- [giggles]
- IF LIFE HAS TAUGHT ME ANYTHING

13:53.067 --> 13:54.800
IT'S NOT TO LOOK
FOR EVERYTHING IN ONE MAN.

13:54.833 --> 13:58.367
BECAUSE ONE MAN WOULD NEVER HAVE
ALL THE THINGS THAT I REQUIRE.

13:58.400 --> 14:01.067
SEE, THAT'S WHY
I HAVE ONE FOR SEX,

14:01.067 --> 14:02.433
I HAVE ONE
FOR SOCIAL FUNCTIONS,

14:02.467 --> 14:03.900
AND ONE TO PAY
FOR TREATS LIKE TODAY,

14:03.933 --> 14:05.300
ET CETERA, ET CETERA.

14:05.333 --> 14:07.067
- SO YOU USED YOUR HEAD
TO PAY FOR TODAY?

14:07.100 --> 14:08.833
- GIRL, PLEASE, MALCOLM'S
PAYING FOR THE DAY,

14:08.867 --> 14:10.267
AND HE AIN'T
EVEN SMELLED IT YET.

14:10.300 --> 14:12.500
[all giggle]
- CHOCOLATE TRUMP.

14:12.533 --> 14:15.067
THE NEW GUY.
HE MIGHT HAVE WHAT IT TAKES

14:15.100 --> 14:17.467
TO MAKE EVEN A PIMP LIKE YOU
FALL IN LOVE.

14:17.500 --> 14:20.500
- UGH! LOVE IS
AN ILLUSION FOR THE WEAK.

14:20.533 --> 14:22.600
ALL WE NEED IS GOOD SEX

14:22.633 --> 14:23.933
AND MONEY IN THE BANK.
CHA-CHING!

14:23.967 --> 14:25.933
- GIRL, WHAT DO YOU
REALLY HAVE UNDER THAT ROBE?

14:25.967 --> 14:27.200
- ASS.

14:27.233 --> 14:28.933
- ALL WE NEED
IS WHAT APRIL HAS.

14:28.967 --> 14:31.767
OF ALL THE COOL,
SINGLE BLACK WOMEN I KNOW

14:31.800 --> 14:33.333
WHO ARE LOOKING
FOR A GOOD BLACK MAN,

14:33.367 --> 14:35.733
IT IS MY WHITE GIRLFRIEND
WHO SNAGS HIM.

14:35.767 --> 14:37.500
- YEAH.
DARRYL IS THE EXCEPTION.

14:37.533 --> 14:39.867
- [chuckles]
YEAH.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.567
HE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL.

14:44.767 --> 14:46.067
I'M HAVING AN AFFAIR.

14:46.067 --> 14:48.233
- OH, HELL NO.
- BITCH, WHAT?

14:48.267 --> 14:50.433
- I KNOW, IT'S WRONG,
IT'S IMMORAL,

14:50.467 --> 14:53.067
BUT...
IT'S SO DAMN EXCITING!

14:53.067 --> 14:55.333
- APRIL, HOW COULD YOU?
AND WITH WHO?

14:55.367 --> 14:58.233
NO, I DON'T WANNA KNOW.
NO.

14:58.267 --> 15:00.233
- YOU JUST NEVER
KNOW PEOPLE, DO YOU?

15:00.267 --> 15:03.067
- NO, EXCUSE ME, I HAVE
BEEN MARRIED SINCE I WAS 20.

15:03.100 --> 15:05.233
OKAY, HE WAS THE FIRST GUY
THAT I MET WHEN I GOT OUT HERE.

15:05.267 --> 15:07.833
I HAVE NOT LIVED.
- IT IS WOMEN LIKE YOU

15:07.867 --> 15:11.233
WHO TURN GOOD MEN BAD.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

15:11.267 --> 15:12.667
- Y'ALL ACTING
LIKE I'M CHEATING ON YOU.

15:12.700 --> 15:14.067
GIVE ME A BREAK.

15:14.067 --> 15:15.833
- COULD I MAKE
A SMALL SUGGESTION?

15:15.867 --> 15:17.367
all: HELL NO!

15:17.400 --> 15:22.200
[laughter]

15:22.233 --> 15:25.200
[music playing]

15:25.233 --> 15:29.300
*

15:29.333 --> 15:32.867
- [gasps]
OH, MY GOD, I LOOK INCREDIBLE.

15:32.900 --> 15:36.400
AND I NEVER SAY THAT, I
JUST COULDN'T PICTURE IT ON ME.

15:36.433 --> 15:39.833
- OOH.
YOU'RE WEARING THAT DRESS.

15:39.867 --> 15:42.067
- THANK YOU.
- I TOLD YOU, I KNOW MY ISH.

15:42.067 --> 15:44.467
- WELL, KEEP DOING YOU,
BECAUSE MY FIANCE'S FOLLOWING ME

15:44.500 --> 15:46.467
FROM STORE TO STORE
WITH HIS BLACK CARD.

15:46.500 --> 15:47.900
- OH,
THAT'S MY KIND OF GIRL.

15:47.933 --> 15:49.500
WE HAVE SHOES
TO GO WITH THAT, TOO.

15:49.533 --> 15:51.133
- [giggles]
- OOH.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.533
VAL, YOUR STUFF
IS SO UNIQUE.

15:53.567 --> 15:55.700
AND I LOVE THAT, BECAUSE
I GET PHOTOGRAPHED A LOT.

15:55.733 --> 15:57.233
PLUS, I JUST
MOVED OUT HERE FROM MIAMI,

15:57.267 --> 15:58.300
AND I DIDN'T THINK
I WOULD FIND

15:58.333 --> 15:59.300
A STYLIST WHO WOULD GET ME.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.800
BUT YOU DO.

16:00.833 --> 16:02.700
I HOPE YOU KNOW
YOU HAVE A NEW BEST FRIEND.

16:02.733 --> 16:05.167
- PHOTOGRAPHED A LOT?
STYLIST?

16:05.200 --> 16:07.800
THAT'S HOW YOU ROLL?
- WELL, I HATE TO DROP NAMES,

16:07.833 --> 16:11.200
BUT I WILL, 'CAUSE IT'S MINE...
MY FATHER'S JERRY WATERS.

16:13.567 --> 16:15.333
HE JUST BOUGHT
THE ATLANTA DUNKS,

16:15.367 --> 16:17.367
BUT ONLY BECAUSE
HE NEEDED A NEW HOBBY.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.200
SO I ROLL
THE WAY DADDY ROLLS.

16:19.233 --> 16:22.200
AND LET ME TELL YOU,
DADDY'S GOT SOME BIG WHEELS.

16:22.233 --> 16:24.067
- WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT VEST
COMES IN THREE COLORS.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.633
- CAN I SEE ALL THREE?
[both laugh]

16:26.667 --> 16:28.700
- I JUST WANNA KNOW
IF DADDY'S CUTE.

16:28.733 --> 16:30.133
- OKAY...

16:30.167 --> 16:32.433
LET ME TELL YOU WHY
I LOVE MY JOB.

16:32.467 --> 16:34.167
I JUST GOT US THREE TICKETS

16:34.200 --> 16:36.367
TO A PRIVATE
LISTENING PARTY FOR SADE!

16:36.400 --> 16:39.700
[both gasp]
- I LOVE SADE, I LOVE SAD--

16:39.733 --> 16:41.700
- OH, WAIT.
I ONLY GOT THREE.

16:41.733 --> 16:43.767
- WELL, KEISHA WILL UNDERSTAND,
SHE CAN GO NEXT TIME.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.800
- UH-UH.
- UH, NO, BOO.

16:45.833 --> 16:47.867
US MEANT
ME, VAL, AND KEISHA.

16:47.900 --> 16:50.600
SORRY.
- [blows kiss]

16:50.633 --> 16:52.467
- WHEN YOUR BOSS
RUNS A RECORD LABEL,

16:52.500 --> 16:54.500
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE
TO USE WHAT GOD GAVE YOU

16:54.533 --> 16:57.667
AND GET SOME PERKS...
FOR EVERYONE.

16:57.700 --> 16:59.433
- AW.
HE'S REALLY SAD, HUH?

16:59.467 --> 17:03.267
- AND HE DOES LOVE SADE.
- ANYWAY.

17:03.300 --> 17:05.233
SO WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
GONNA WEAR?

17:05.267 --> 17:08.100
- I DON'T KNOW...
[chatter overlaps]

17:08.133 --> 17:11.267
- I'M JEALOUS.
I WANT SOME GIRLFRIENDS.

17:11.300 --> 17:13.233
DON'T THINK I'M WEIRD,
BUT DO YOU THINK

17:13.267 --> 17:14.933
I CAN COME HANG OUT
WITH YOU GUYS SOMETIME?

17:14.967 --> 17:16.733
YOU SEEM REAL COOL.
- OH.

17:16.767 --> 17:19.067
- PLUS, THE ONLY PERSON
I KNOW OUT HERE IS MY FIANCE.

17:19.067 --> 17:20.467
- SURE.
- MM.

17:20.500 --> 17:21.733
- MAYBE WE COULD ALL
GO GET A DRINK SOMETIME.

17:21.767 --> 17:23.233
- YEAH.
- LISTEN,

17:23.267 --> 17:26.633
ALL WOMEN ARE NOT HATERS.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

17:28.767 --> 17:30.633
- HEY, BABY.
YOU LIKE MY DRESS?

17:37.667 --> 17:39.267
- [softly sighs]

17:45.100 --> 17:48.833
- DID I MISS SOMETHING?
[door slams]

17:54.767 --> 17:57.367
- THANK YOU.
SEE YOU SOON.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.233
- VAL, IF YOU NEED TO
TAKE A BREATHER,

18:03.267 --> 18:04.967
ME AND OMAR CAN RUN
THE STORE FOR YOU TODAY.

18:05.067 --> 18:06.533
- [giggles]

18:06.567 --> 18:07.967
- WELL, I AT LEAST
HAD TO OFFER.

18:08.067 --> 18:11.600
- OH, YEAH.
THANKS, I NEEDED THAT LAUGH.

18:21.067 --> 18:23.800
- KEISHA, KEISHA.
LONG TIME, NO SEE, GIRL.

18:23.833 --> 18:25.567
- HI, JASMINE.
HOW ARE YOU?

18:25.600 --> 18:27.167
- I'M WELL.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.933
MY FRIEND GAVE ME
A FLYER TO THE STORE OPENING,

18:28.967 --> 18:30.533
SO I WANTED
TO COME CHECK IT OUT.

18:30.567 --> 18:31.667
YOU WORK HERE?

18:31.700 --> 18:33.900
[chuckles]
HOW CUTE.

18:33.933 --> 18:35.600
CAM'RON TOLD ME
YOU WAS DOING HIS VIDEO.

18:35.633 --> 18:38.700
HE ASKED ME TO,
BUT I HAD TO TURN IT DOWN.

18:38.733 --> 18:41.233
YOU KNOW I QUIT
THE VIDEO BUSINESS, RIGHT?

18:41.267 --> 18:43.433
- [scoffs]
- I FOUND GOD,

18:43.467 --> 18:45.333
AND HE TOLD ME
TO MAKE A CHANGE.

18:45.367 --> 18:47.067
SO I'M A WRITER NOW.

18:47.067 --> 18:49.067
- [chuckles]
GOD TOLD YOU TO BE A WRITER?

18:49.067 --> 18:51.933
- SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
AND, ACTUALLY...

18:51.967 --> 18:54.100
YOU'RE IN QUITE
A FEW CHAPTERS IN MY BOOK.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.133
- EXCUSE ME?
- I'M WRITING A TELL-ALL BOOK

18:57.167 --> 18:58.733
ABOUT MY YEARS OF BEING
A VIDEO VIXEN.

18:58.767 --> 19:02.067
I GOT LOTS OF STORIES
ABOUT LOTS OF RAPPERS.

19:02.067 --> 19:04.833
AND I'M ABOUT TO GET PAID.

19:04.867 --> 19:06.833
I DIDN'T HAVE
ALL THAT FUN FOR NOTHING.

19:06.867 --> 19:09.667
- WHAT DO I HAVE
TO DO WITH YOU BEING A HO?

19:09.700 --> 19:13.067
- YOU DON'T THINK ANYBODY
SAW YOU DOING YOUR DIRTY DEEDS?

19:13.067 --> 19:14.867
BUT I DID.

19:14.900 --> 19:18.300
- I DON'T KNOW IF SOMEONE
SLIPPED SOMETHING IN YOUR DRINK,

19:18.333 --> 19:20.367
OR YOU JUST
TRULY GONE CRAZY,

19:20.400 --> 19:22.167
BUT I KNOW ONE THING...

19:22.200 --> 19:25.967
YOU PRINT ANY LIES ABOUT ME,
AND YOU'LL BE SORRY.

19:26.067 --> 19:29.400
- [forced giggle]

19:31.167 --> 19:34.333
OOH!
THIS IS KINDA CUTE.

19:34.367 --> 19:37.333
I MIGHT HAVE TO
COME BACK AND GET THAT.

19:37.367 --> 19:39.767
SEE YA.

19:41.467 --> 19:43.800
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

19:43.833 --> 19:45.200
- BEAUTIFUL.

19:45.233 --> 19:47.733
- GREAT.
SHOULD I RING IT UP?

19:47.767 --> 19:49.067
- YES.

19:49.100 --> 19:50.367
A SMILE WOULD BE NICE, TOO.

19:52.833 --> 19:55.233
HERE, FIRST
TELL ME SOMETHING.

19:55.267 --> 19:57.833
WHICH ONE OF THESE HATS
MAKES ME LOOK COOL ENOUGH

19:57.867 --> 20:00.333
TO ASK YOU ON A DATE?
- [giggles]

20:00.367 --> 20:02.500
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TRY THEM ON...

20:02.533 --> 20:04.800
YOU TELL ME THE FIRST THING
THAT COMES TO YOUR MIND.

20:04.833 --> 20:06.500
- [clears throat]

20:06.533 --> 20:08.700
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

20:10.700 --> 20:11.800
- MARRIAGE?

20:11.833 --> 20:14.900
WOW.
[chuckles]

20:14.933 --> 20:16.233
I'M K.C.

20:16.267 --> 20:18.200
YOU ARE?
- VAL.

20:18.233 --> 20:21.367
RELAX, K.C., IT'S
JUST A THEORETICAL QUESTION.

20:21.400 --> 20:23.867
I JUST HEARD ONCE
THAT A MAN KNOWS WITHIN

20:23.900 --> 20:25.733
THE FIRST 15 MINUTES OF
MEETING A WOMAN

20:25.767 --> 20:27.700
WHETHER HE
WOULD MARRY HER OR NOT.

20:27.733 --> 20:30.300
- THAT'S THE MOST RIDICULOUS
THING I EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE!

20:30.333 --> 20:32.467
LOOK, A MAN DON'T KNOW
WHETHER HE'LL MARRY A WOMAN

20:32.500 --> 20:35.400
UNTIL HE SLEEPS WITH HER.
- THAT'S DION.

20:35.433 --> 20:37.600
WHEN HE STARTS
DRAGGING HIS KNUCKLES LIKE THAT,

20:37.633 --> 20:39.700
YOU JUST--
YOU GOTTA IGNORE HIM.

20:39.733 --> 20:41.267
- [chuckles]
- WHERE WERE WE?

20:41.300 --> 20:42.967
- YOU WERE ABOUT
TO GIVE ME YOUR VIEW

20:43.000 --> 20:44.633
ON THE 15 MINUTE THEORY.

20:44.667 --> 20:46.867
- WELL, LOOK, I KNOW
YOU DIDN'T ASK ME, BUT...

20:46.900 --> 20:48.933
IN MY CASE, IT WAS TRUE.

20:48.967 --> 20:50.500
- YOU REALLY
KNEW IN 15 MINUTES?

20:50.533 --> 20:52.167
- YEAH.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.600
TAKE ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES
TO GET HER PREGNANT.

20:53.633 --> 20:55.133
BAM!

20:55.167 --> 20:56.767
AFTER THAT, I HAD NO OTHER
CHOICE BUT TO MARRY HER.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.133
LOOK,
THE REAL TRUTH IS THAT

20:58.167 --> 21:00.233
A MAN DON'T
EVER WANNA GET MARRIED.

21:00.267 --> 21:02.500
Y'ALL FORCE US
INTO THIS MESS RIGHT HERE.

21:02.533 --> 21:06.267
WE GET AS FAR AS WE CAN
WITH WIT AND CHARM

21:06.300 --> 21:08.767
TO FIND THAT WHEN WE MEET
THAT ONE WE LIKE SO MUCH,

21:08.800 --> 21:12.500
THAT WHEN
SHE LAYS DOWN THE LAW...

21:12.533 --> 21:16.233
WE GOTTA MARRY HER
OR LOSE HER.

21:16.267 --> 21:18.600
- HOW ROMANTIC.

21:18.633 --> 21:20.600
- LISTEN,
IF YOU WANNA CONTINUE

21:20.633 --> 21:22.900
THIS CONVERSATION
OVER DINNER,

21:22.933 --> 21:26.167
GIVE ME A CALL.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.867
- A TATTOO ARTIST?

21:27.900 --> 21:29.333
- I OWN THE SHOP.

21:29.367 --> 21:32.433
- [giggles]
I WASN'T TRIPPING.

21:34.533 --> 21:36.100
- THAT'S THREE TIMES.

21:36.133 --> 21:38.333
IT'S NOW COSTING US MONEY
TO RUN YOUR CARD.

21:38.367 --> 21:41.833
- SO I GUESS THAT MEANS YOU
WON'T BE TAKING ME TO DINNER.

21:41.867 --> 21:44.100
- DO YOU HAVE CASH,
OR WHAT?

21:44.133 --> 21:46.067
- JUST PUT
OUR STUFF TOGETHER.

21:46.067 --> 21:49.067
- [sighs]

21:49.100 --> 21:52.900
- SO VAL...
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE SINGLE.

21:52.933 --> 21:54.167
- HMM.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.667
THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

21:55.700 --> 21:57.100
- [clears throat]

21:57.133 --> 21:59.667
I'M STILL GETTING USED
TO THE TITLE.

21:59.700 --> 22:02.333
- HER EX DUMPED HER.
AND WITHIN THREE MONTHS,

22:02.367 --> 22:04.233
HE MET SOMEBODY NEW
AND GOT ENGAGED.

22:04.267 --> 22:06.400
THEN HE SENT
HIS NEW PIECE IN HERE TODAY

22:06.433 --> 22:08.467
TO RUB IT IN MY GIRL'S FACE.
AIN'T THAT CRAZY.

22:08.500 --> 22:10.667
- WELL, THAT
WAS OBVIOUSLY HIS LOSS.

22:10.700 --> 22:12.167
- OOH-OOH-OOH!
DON'T SOUND TO ME LIKE

22:12.200 --> 22:13.700
HE JUST MET THE WOMAN.

22:13.733 --> 22:16.467
SOUND LIKE OLD BOY
BEEN CREEPIN' ALL ALONG.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.833
PLAYA PLAYA
KEPT ONE IN THE FREEZER!

22:18.867 --> 22:21.400
[chuckles, chokes]
MM, THAT AIN'T EVEN RIGHT.

22:21.433 --> 22:23.633
- WHAT DO YOU
BRING TO THE GROUP, HUH?

22:23.667 --> 22:25.367
- I--
- OH, FORGET IT, WE'RE CLOSED.

22:25.400 --> 22:27.600
- THANK YOU.

22:42.767 --> 22:45.167
[tapping on glass]

22:49.700 --> 22:54.467
- HI.
- HEY.

22:54.500 --> 22:57.733
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T
EXPECT YOU TO CALL, BUT...

22:57.767 --> 22:58.800
I'M STOKED YOU DID.

22:58.833 --> 23:01.567
- [giggles]
- SO...

23:01.600 --> 23:03.367
YOUR WISH IS MY COMMAND.

23:03.400 --> 23:04.567
WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO?

23:04.600 --> 23:07.067
- I WANNA DO SOMETHING...

23:09.100 --> 23:11.433
DIFFERENT.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.233
- WAIT A SECOND.
WAIT.

23:18.267 --> 23:20.467
ARE YOU SURE?
BECAUSE I GOT THE FEELING

23:20.500 --> 23:23.067
YOU WERE LOOKING FOR MORE.
YOU KNOW, LIKE...

23:23.067 --> 23:25.333
A GOOD GUY.
- [sighs]

23:25.367 --> 23:28.067
- I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO--
- SHH.

23:28.067 --> 23:29.600
DON'T THINK, K.C.

23:29.633 --> 23:31.333
JUST DO.

23:31.367 --> 23:34.333
[music playing]

23:34.367 --> 23:42.367
*

23:58.500 --> 24:01.667
- [chuckles]

24:01.700 --> 24:03.300
GOOD GIRL.

24:03.333 --> 24:05.133
ALWAYS REMEMBER.
- MM.

24:05.167 --> 24:06.767
- [chuckles]

24:06.800 --> 24:09.300
- WELL, YOU MAY HAVE
TO GET A NEW FAVORITE COLOR,

24:09.333 --> 24:12.333
BECAUSE
I'M RUNNING OUT OF RED.

24:12.367 --> 24:15.533
HI, HANDSOME.
- HEY, PRETTY GIRL.

24:15.567 --> 24:18.067
- [chuckles]
SPEAKING OF PRETTY.

24:18.067 --> 24:19.533
- OH, TRY THEM ON.

24:19.567 --> 24:21.533
I CUSTOM-MADE THESE
FOR J-LO,

24:21.567 --> 24:23.533
BUT SHE SENT THEM
BACK TO ME.

24:23.567 --> 24:25.300
TOLD ME
TO PICK THE DIAMONDS,

24:25.333 --> 24:27.300
AND I THOUGHT THESE WOULD
LOOK NICE AGAINST HER SKIN.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.367
- [sighs]
- SHE DISAGREED.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.833
- WELL, EITHER THAT BITCH
IS BLIND OR INSANE,

24:31.867 --> 24:34.367
BECAUSE THESE ARE BANANAS.
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

24:34.400 --> 24:36.433
- OH!
- BESIDES,

24:36.467 --> 24:38.833
I ONLY WANT WOMEN WHO APPRECIATE
MY PIECES TO WEAR THEM.

24:40.833 --> 24:42.200
- MM.

24:42.233 --> 24:44.467
HOW CAN I SHOW YOU
MY APPRECIATION?

24:44.500 --> 24:46.500
- MM.

24:46.533 --> 24:48.067
YOU LIKE SURPRISES?

24:48.067 --> 24:51.433
- UH-HUH.
[chuckles]

24:51.467 --> 24:53.900
- I SENT MY CHEF HOME.
I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD

24:53.933 --> 24:55.433
COOK A LITTLE SOMETHING
FOR ME TONIGHT.

24:55.467 --> 24:57.733
- MM.
- I LIKE SMOTHERED PORK CHOPS,

24:57.767 --> 25:00.900
OLD-FASHIONED MAC AND CHEESE,
MAYBE SOME GREENS,

25:00.933 --> 25:03.733
MAYBE A PEACH COBBLER.
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME

25:03.767 --> 25:05.833
SINCE A WOMAN
SPOILED ME LIKE THAT.

25:08.533 --> 25:11.967
- SO I WORE RED FOR YOU,
I'M COOKING DINNER,

25:12.067 --> 25:13.667
YOU TOOK THE DIAMONDS OFF--

25:13.700 --> 25:16.167
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT KEISHA'S SURPRISE IS.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.567
[giggles]
- [chuckles]

25:18.600 --> 25:21.133
YOU CAN'T COOK.
OH.

25:21.167 --> 25:22.600
IT'S TYPICAL, YOU KNOW.

25:22.633 --> 25:24.800
PRETTY GIRL,
LOST IN THE KITCHEN.

25:24.833 --> 25:27.267
[chuckles]

25:30.600 --> 25:32.567
- I KNOW HOW TO COOK.

25:32.600 --> 25:35.733
I JUST DIDN'T THINK I'D BE
WEARING AN APRON OVER ALL THIS.

25:35.767 --> 25:37.533
WHERE'S YOUR KITCHEN?

25:47.467 --> 25:50.700
- [clears throat]

25:54.633 --> 25:55.867
HUH?

25:55.900 --> 25:58.867
MMM, MMM.

25:58.900 --> 26:01.400
YEP.

26:01.433 --> 26:03.267
VOILA.

26:03.300 --> 26:06.400
- OKAY, TWO THINGS.

26:06.433 --> 26:10.500
I LIKE BREAKFAST...
FOR BREAKFAST.

26:10.533 --> 26:13.067
AND I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
TO TAKE ME SERIOUSLY, KEISHA!

26:13.067 --> 26:14.933
I MEAN, I WAS JOKING!

26:14.967 --> 26:17.700
BUT YOU, YOU WENT RIGHT ON IN
THERE WITH AUTHORITY

26:17.733 --> 26:20.067
AND I HEARD
POTS AND PANS BANGING,

26:20.067 --> 26:22.333
CABINETS OPENING,
STUFF SIZZLING.

26:22.367 --> 26:24.700
I DID GET KINDA HAPPY.

26:24.733 --> 26:26.767
- OKAY.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.167
TWO THINGS.

26:28.200 --> 26:30.533
I COULD REALLY
HURT YOU RIGHT NOW.

26:30.567 --> 26:32.867
AND OKAY, I DON'T
REALLY COOK ALL THAT MUCH.

26:32.900 --> 26:34.567
[giggles]

26:34.600 --> 26:38.267
- LISTEN, I HAD MY CHEF LEAVE US
TWO PLATES IN THE WARMER

26:38.300 --> 26:40.667
AND WE CAN JUST EAT THAT.

26:40.700 --> 26:43.800
[chuckles]
- OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

26:43.833 --> 26:45.733
WE GONNA EAT THIS.

26:45.767 --> 26:47.333
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA LICK OUR
FINGERS AND SAY "THANK YOU,"

26:47.367 --> 26:48.733
AND TELL KEISHA
HOW TASTY IT WAS,

26:48.767 --> 26:51.167
AND WORTH
SWEATING THROUGH HER DRESS.

26:51.200 --> 26:53.667
- [chuckles]

26:53.700 --> 26:57.233
- OH, I SEE WHAT YOU ARE.

26:57.267 --> 27:00.167
YOU ONE OF THOSE KIND OF GUYS
THAT LIKE TO INTIMIDATE GIRLS.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.367
YOU KNOW,
GET THEM OFF-BALANCE.

27:01.400 --> 27:03.067
AND YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH IT

27:03.067 --> 27:05.200
BECAUSE YOU GOT MONEY,
AND CHARM, AND YOU INTELLIGENT.

27:05.233 --> 27:07.067
[chuckles]

27:07.067 --> 27:11.833
YOU MUST BE USED TO YOUNGER,
INEXPERIENCED, INSECURE WOMEN.

27:11.867 --> 27:15.067
MALCOLM, I ASSURE YOU...

27:15.067 --> 27:18.567
I'M NOT THAT GIRL.
AND BASED ON THE FACT THAT

27:18.600 --> 27:21.667
WE ONLY SEE EACH OTHER WHEN
YOU WANT AND WHERE YOU WANT,

27:21.700 --> 27:24.067
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
A CONTROL FREAK TOO.

27:24.100 --> 27:27.100
BUT KNOW THIS.
I AIN'T SCARED OF YOU.

27:32.367 --> 27:34.067
NOW WE CAN EAT.

27:34.067 --> 27:36.133
- SO YOU ACTUALLY
CAME ALL THE WAY OVER HERE

27:36.167 --> 27:37.633
TO FINALLY GET
THAT OFF YOUR CHEST?

27:37.667 --> 27:39.233
- WELL, I ACTUALLY
CAME OVER HERE TO SEE

27:39.267 --> 27:40.500
IF I WAS STILL INTERESTED
IN LETTING YOU DATE ME.

27:40.533 --> 27:42.367
- "LETTING" ME DATE YOU?

27:42.400 --> 27:43.733
- UH-HUH.
- OH.

27:43.767 --> 27:45.500
WELL, HOW'S THAT
WORKING OUT SO FAR?

27:45.533 --> 27:48.233
- WELL, YOU HAVEN'T TOTALLY
RUINED YOUR CHANCES YET.

27:48.267 --> 27:51.200
- YOU'RE A BRAT.
- MM.

27:51.233 --> 27:52.700
- SPOILED.
- MM.

27:52.733 --> 27:55.200
- PRETTY EYES.
- MM.

27:55.233 --> 27:58.500
- PERFECT NOSE.
SEXY LIPS.

27:58.533 --> 28:01.767
LEGS THAT WILL NOT QUIT.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.933
MM.

28:03.967 --> 28:06.767
AND DON'T EVEN
GET ME STARTED ON YOUR ASS.

28:06.800 --> 28:10.333
- [soft giggle]

28:10.367 --> 28:12.333
- BUT LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, KEISHA.

28:12.367 --> 28:15.167
I AM NOT LIKE MOST DUDES.

28:15.200 --> 28:17.300
IT TAKES A LOT
MORE THAN A PRETTY FACE

28:17.333 --> 28:19.267
AND A SHORT DRESS
TO IMPRESS ME.

28:19.300 --> 28:21.567
YEAH.
YEAH, YOU GOT MY ATTENTION

28:21.600 --> 28:24.600
BUT NOW YOU GOTTA KEEP IT.

28:24.633 --> 28:25.933
- YOU THROUGH?

28:25.967 --> 28:28.067
- OH, NO.

28:28.100 --> 28:30.767
NOW I'M SORRY YOU SPENT
15 MINUTES MAKING A MEAL

28:30.800 --> 28:33.167
THAT I'M SURE TASTES GOOD.

28:33.200 --> 28:36.133
HOWEVER,
MY FOUR-STAR CHEF

28:36.167 --> 28:39.133
MADE US A MEAL THAT
I KNOW WE ARE BOTH GONNA PREFER.

28:39.167 --> 28:41.067
AND THAT'S
WHAT WE'RE GONNA EAT.

28:41.067 --> 28:43.133
SO WHAT ARE
YOU DRINKING TONIGHT?

28:43.167 --> 28:46.733
WINE...OR CHAMPAGNE?

28:52.933 --> 28:55.633
- CHAMPAGNE.

[music playing]

28:58.667 --> 29:06.733
*

29:20.633 --> 29:22.233
- PLEASE DON'T PICK UP.

29:22.267 --> 29:23.800
[softly]
THANK YOU.

29:23.833 --> 29:25.733
HEY, K.C., IT'S VAL.

29:25.767 --> 29:27.867
YES, I'VE GOTTEN
ALL OF YOUR MESSAGES.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.533
I'VE JUST BEEN SUPER BUSY.

29:29.567 --> 29:32.867
SO ANYWAY, YOU KNOW,
WE BARELY KNOW EACH OTHER.

29:32.900 --> 29:34.433
SO LET'S JUST CHALK IT UP
TO THAT ONE TIME

29:34.467 --> 29:35.733
AND FORGET
IT EVER HAPPENED.

29:35.767 --> 29:36.967
OKAY?

29:37.067 --> 29:38.467
GREAT.
THANKS.

29:38.500 --> 29:40.300
TAKE CARE.
BYE.

29:47.067 --> 29:50.667
[knocking on door]

29:59.800 --> 30:02.700
THANKS FOR COMING.

30:02.733 --> 30:06.733
- WOW.
YOU LOOK NICE.

30:06.767 --> 30:09.267
- I HAVE A DATE.

30:09.300 --> 30:11.067
THIS ISN'T
GONNA TAKE LONG.

30:11.100 --> 30:13.300
I JUST NEED
TO SAY A FEW THINGS.

30:13.333 --> 30:15.467
- DAMN.

30:15.500 --> 30:17.967
YOU REALLY LOOK GOOD.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.033
- QUINN,
I NEED CLOSURE.

30:21.067 --> 30:24.300
JUST HELP ME UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU WEREN'T BIG ENOUGH

30:24.333 --> 30:26.167
TO END IT A LONG TIME AGO.

30:26.200 --> 30:29.500
WHY DID WE GO ON IF YOU KNEW
WE DIDN'T HAVE A FUTURE?

30:29.533 --> 30:31.200
- WE HAD
A FUTURE TOGETHER, VAL.

30:31.233 --> 30:33.000
IT JUST DIDN'T
INVOLVE MARRIAGE.

30:33.033 --> 30:34.667
AND I WAS OKAY WITH THAT
IN THE BEGINNING,

30:34.700 --> 30:35.933
AND YOU WERE TOO,
REMEMBER?

30:35.967 --> 30:38.100
- YEAH!
IN THE BEGINNING.

30:38.133 --> 30:39.833
BUT STUFF CHANGES.

30:39.867 --> 30:42.200
I THOUGHT WE
WERE CHANGING TOGETHER.

30:42.233 --> 30:44.100
I MEAN, WHEN YOU SPEND
FIVE YEARS WITH SOMEONE,

30:44.133 --> 30:46.033
AND YOU START
PICKING OUT BABY NAMES...

30:46.067 --> 30:47.367
IS IT CRAZY
TO THINK THAT A WEDDING

30:47.400 --> 30:48.900
IS SOMEWHERE IN THE FUTURE?

30:48.933 --> 30:51.667
- THE TIMING WASN'T EVER
RIGHT WITH US, VAL.

30:51.700 --> 30:53.400
IT JUST WASN'T EVER
GONNA HAPPEN.

30:53.433 --> 30:56.900
- WELL, OBVIOUSLY IT
WASN'T GONNA HAPPEN WITH ME.

30:56.933 --> 30:58.733
BUT YOU DIDN'T
WASTE ANY TIME GOING OUT

30:58.767 --> 31:00.767
AND MAKING IT HAPPEN
WITH SOME OTHER CHICK.

31:00.800 --> 31:03.500
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?
- LOOK, WE'D STILL BE TOGETHER

31:03.533 --> 31:06.600
IF YOU HADN'T
GIVEN ME THAT ULTIMATUM.

31:06.633 --> 31:08.567
BUT I'M GLAD YOU DID.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.500
OKAY, LOOK,
YOU WANNA HEAR THE TRUTH?

31:10.533 --> 31:12.167
THEN HERE IT IS.

31:12.200 --> 31:13.967
MY MAMA LIKED YOU.
- [scoffs]

31:14.067 --> 31:16.600
- YOU LOOKED GOOD ON MY ARM,
YOU NEVER GAVE ME ANY PROBLEMS,

31:16.633 --> 31:20.167
AND IT WAS COOL BETWEEN US.
REAL COOL.

31:20.200 --> 31:23.833
SO I FIGURED I'D EVENTUALLY
FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU.

31:25.967 --> 31:28.133
BUT I NEVER DID.

31:28.167 --> 31:30.733
- WAIT A MINUTE...

31:30.767 --> 31:32.300
QUINN ANDRE DAVIS,

31:32.333 --> 31:34.067
ARE YOU SAYING YOU WERE NEVER
IN LOVE WITH ME?

31:34.067 --> 31:36.567
- VAL, I LOVED YOU, YEAH.
I DID.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.200
AND I CARED ABOUT YOU.
I STILL DO.

31:38.233 --> 31:40.300
AND IF YOU
HADN'T PRESSED ME,

31:40.333 --> 31:42.533
I WOULDN'T HAVE REALIZED
I WAS SETTLING WITH YOU.

31:45.533 --> 31:47.167
LOOK...

31:47.200 --> 31:49.200
VAL, I DIDN'T KNOW.

31:49.233 --> 31:51.867
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT YOU WEREN'T THE ONE

31:51.900 --> 31:53.333
UNTIL I MET SHELLY,

31:53.367 --> 31:55.133
AND IT WAS SO CLEAR TO ME
THAT SHE WAS.

31:55.167 --> 31:57.667
- NO.
NO, NO, NO!

31:57.700 --> 31:59.300
NO!

31:59.333 --> 32:01.467
YOU WERE IN A DIFFERENT CITY
EVERY OTHER WEEK!

32:01.500 --> 32:02.933
YOU WERE SEEING THAT GIRL

32:02.967 --> 32:05.167
WHILE I WAS THE FOOL AT HOME
LOVING YOU!

32:05.200 --> 32:07.067
YOU'RE TRYING
TO JUSTIFY YOUR CHEATING?

32:07.067 --> 32:08.600
DON'T INSULT ME.
- LOOK,

32:08.633 --> 32:11.167
YOU CAN TELL YOURSELF
WHATEVER YOU NEED TO.

32:11.200 --> 32:14.633
I DIDN'T MEET SHELLY
UNTIL AFTER WE BROKE UP.

32:14.667 --> 32:17.400
I NEVER MEANT
TO DO YOU WRONG.

32:17.433 --> 32:21.100
BUT REALLY,
I DID BOTH OF US A FAVOR.

32:21.133 --> 32:24.667
SO NOW...
YOU CAN GO FIND SOMEONE ELSE

32:24.700 --> 32:26.400
TO LOVE YOU
THE WAY YOU NEED IT.

32:28.500 --> 32:30.367
LIKE I DID.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.067
- IF I WERE
A WEAKER WOMAN,

32:32.067 --> 32:34.267
I'D BE REALLY
SCREWED-UP RIGHT NOW.

32:34.300 --> 32:36.333
BUT I KNOW MY WORTH.

32:36.367 --> 32:40.700
I'M INTELLIGENT, FINE,
I OWN MY OWN BUSINESS.

32:40.733 --> 32:42.567
ACTUALLY,
YOU'RE THE WEAK ONE

32:42.600 --> 32:44.600
FOR NOT RECOGNIZING
WHAT YOU LOST.

32:44.633 --> 32:46.567
YOU NEVER DESERVED ME.

32:46.600 --> 32:49.400
SO PLEASE...

32:49.433 --> 32:51.467
LET THE DOOR HIT YOU
ON THE WAY OUT.

32:52.600 --> 32:53.967
GET OUT OF MY APARTMENT!

32:55.233 --> 32:56.933
- VALERIE, LISTEN...
- GET OUT!

33:09.133 --> 33:12.800
[upset panting]

33:19.067 --> 33:22.600
[soft crying]

33:38.367 --> 33:40.167
NO.

33:40.200 --> 33:42.633
[crying]
- HEY, HEY.

33:42.667 --> 33:44.667
COME HERE.

33:44.700 --> 33:48.333
- [crying]

34:05.767 --> 34:08.733
[music playing]

34:08.767 --> 34:16.767
*

34:57.867 --> 34:58.900
- WAIT A MINUTE, CHILLI.

34:58.933 --> 35:01.700
KEVIN, LAMAR, AND DAVE?

35:01.733 --> 35:04.133
HOW HAVE WE MANAGED
TO DATE THE SAME GUYS?

35:04.167 --> 35:06.233
THIS TOWN IS WAY TOO SMALL.

35:06.267 --> 35:09.733
- THERE'S ONE MAN FOR
EVERY 12 WOMEN IN ATLANTA.

35:09.767 --> 35:12.233
AND ONE OF US
IS GONNA HAVE TO LEAVE.

35:12.267 --> 35:14.367
I'M GONNA BE THE BIGGER PERSON,
THOUGH, AND VOLUNTEER YOU.

35:14.400 --> 35:16.733
- OH, YEAH?
[both laugh]

35:16.767 --> 35:18.667
- WAIT.
WHAT ABOUT PHIL?

35:18.700 --> 35:21.833
- TALL, CUTE BOOTY,
NICE SEXY ARMS,

35:21.867 --> 35:25.200
BUCKHEAD?
NO, I DON'T KNOW HIM.

35:25.233 --> 35:26.500
- YOU AIN'T RIGHT, GIRL.

35:26.533 --> 35:27.667
- OKAY, OKAY,
WE DATED ONE TIME.

35:27.700 --> 35:30.067
- AH!
- [clears throat]

35:30.067 --> 35:32.300
[longer throat clear]

35:32.333 --> 35:34.067
HE DOES
HAVE A NICE BOOTY.

35:34.067 --> 35:37.467
- OH, HELL NO!
YOU TOO?

35:37.500 --> 35:39.133
YOU--GAME OVER.

35:39.167 --> 35:40.333
I'M GONNA
TALK TO Y'ALL LATER.

35:40.367 --> 35:41.633
- OKAY, THANK YOU
FOR COMING.

35:41.667 --> 35:43.333
- THIS IS SOME BULL.

35:44.367 --> 35:45.600
- WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT
HIS BOOTY?

35:45.633 --> 35:47.633
- LOOKS LIKE
WE GOT THE SAME TASTE.

35:47.667 --> 35:49.233
- OOH, I DON'T
LIKE YOU SAYING THAT,

35:49.267 --> 35:52.100
THAT DOESN'T EVEN SOUND RIGHT.
[giggles]

35:52.133 --> 35:53.967
- IS THAT VAL?

35:54.067 --> 35:55.433
- NO.
CAN'T BE.

35:55.467 --> 35:58.267
- THANK YOU.

36:01.233 --> 36:03.700
- OH!
[giggles]

36:03.733 --> 36:05.867
OOH!
DAMN!

36:05.900 --> 36:08.067
EITHER YOU DISCOVERED
SUGARDADDY.COM,

36:08.067 --> 36:09.600
OR QUINN IS TRYING
TO BUY YOU BACK.

36:09.633 --> 36:11.500
- AS IF I'D LET HIM DO
ANYTHING FOR ME.

36:11.533 --> 36:13.133
I BOUGHT
THIS BAD BOY MYSELF!

36:13.167 --> 36:15.867
FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS,
EVERYTHING HE SAID TO ME

36:15.900 --> 36:17.700
HAS BEEN RUNNING
THROUGH MY MIND ON REPEAT.

36:17.733 --> 36:20.333
AND THIS MORNING, I FINALLY
LET HIS WORDS INSPIRE ME.

36:20.367 --> 36:22.267
- HEY!
- HI!

36:22.300 --> 36:23.833
I JUST BROKE A HELL OF A LOT
OF TRAFFIC LAWS TO GET HERE.

36:23.867 --> 36:25.400
WHAT'S UP?
- THIS!

36:25.433 --> 36:28.667
TA-DA!
- [chuckles]

36:28.700 --> 36:30.767
- OH, YEAH,
IT'S A NICE CAR.

36:30.800 --> 36:32.733
BUT HOW THE HELL
CAN YOU AFFORD IT?

36:32.767 --> 36:34.900
- WELL,
WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS--

36:34.933 --> 36:36.333
- YOU HAD IT OUT WITH
QUINN AGAIN

36:36.367 --> 36:38.167
AND WENT ON
AN EMOTIONAL SPENDING SPREE.

36:38.200 --> 36:40.367
- THEN SOME SLICK SALES GUY
PREYED ON YOUR VULNERABILITY

36:40.400 --> 36:42.367
AND GOT A BIG-ASS
COMMISSION OFF OF IT.

36:42.400 --> 36:45.567
- OKAY, CAN I TELL
MY OWN STORY, PLEASE?

36:45.600 --> 36:47.533
OKAY,
SO YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT.

36:47.567 --> 36:49.867
BUT I FIGURED,
WHY SHOULD I SETTLE

36:49.900 --> 36:52.167
FOR THAT OLD CAR THAT I HAVE
BEEN DRIVING FOR YEARS

36:52.200 --> 36:54.067
THAT I NEVER REALLY LOVED
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

36:54.100 --> 36:56.533
NO ONE SHOULD SETTLE
FOR ANYTHING THAT DOES NOT

36:56.567 --> 36:58.700
MAKE THEM FEEL GOOD,
AND WHOLE, AND VALUABLE.

36:58.733 --> 37:01.067
- ALL THAT'S GREAT,
BUT CAN YOU AFFORD THIS MUG?

37:01.100 --> 37:02.733
- WHO CARES?

37:02.767 --> 37:05.467
BECAUSE NOW I AM MORE
DETERMINED THAN EVER TO MOVE ON.

37:05.500 --> 37:07.100
I FEEL BRAND-NEW.

37:07.133 --> 37:09.467
- AGAIN?
- YES, AGAIN!

37:09.500 --> 37:12.300
PLUS, I'M THROWING MYSELF
A GRAND OPENING PARTY.

37:12.333 --> 37:13.900
AND YOU TWO HAVE
TO HELP ME CELEBRATE.

37:13.933 --> 37:15.433
- OH!
- AND PLAN IT.

37:15.467 --> 37:17.233
- YOU TWO START PLANNING,

37:17.267 --> 37:18.667
I'M GONNA TAKE THE NEW VAL
FOR A LITTLE SPIN.

37:18.700 --> 37:19.900
THROW ME THE KEYS.

37:19.933 --> 37:22.567
- OH, HELL NO.
I'M COMING WITH.

37:22.600 --> 37:25.567
[music playing]

37:25.600 --> 37:33.600
*

37:56.500 --> 37:58.300
- OKAY, VAL,
WHAT IS WRONG?

37:58.333 --> 38:00.067
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE CELEBRATING

38:00.100 --> 38:02.133
AND YOU'VE BEEN MAKING
THAT FACE SINCE WE GOT HERE.

38:02.167 --> 38:03.800
- WHAT FACE?

38:03.833 --> 38:06.267
- THE FACE THAT'S
SAYING SOMETHING'S WRONG.

38:06.300 --> 38:08.400
- WELL, I JUST WANNA
MAKE SURE THE PARTY GOES WELL.

38:08.433 --> 38:11.200
IT WAS STRESSFUL
PLANNING IT, THAT'S ALL.

38:11.233 --> 38:13.067
I SAID THAT'S ALL.

38:13.067 --> 38:15.200
CAN WE TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE, PLEASE?

38:15.233 --> 38:18.500
- OKAY.

38:18.533 --> 38:20.333
HEY, IS
THAT MAYOR HOWARD?

38:20.367 --> 38:23.067
THEY SAY HE'S A REAL COOL,
DOWN-TO-EARTH GUY.

38:23.067 --> 38:24.600
I GUESS IT'S TRUE.

38:24.633 --> 38:26.267
- YEAH,
HE'S REALLY INTERESTING.

38:26.300 --> 38:27.933
HE COMES FROM
A LONG LINE OF POLITICIANS,

38:27.967 --> 38:29.800
LIKE THE KENNEDYS.

38:29.833 --> 38:32.267
IS THAT HIS WIFE?
- YEP, THAT'S HER.

38:32.300 --> 38:34.667
- HE COULD GET IT!
- MM, YES HE COULD.

38:34.700 --> 38:38.333
- HE IS GETTING IT.
ALL OF IT.

38:38.367 --> 38:40.833
- NO!
- YOU DOING THE MAYOR!

38:40.867 --> 38:42.533
- YOU WANNA GET
ON THE MIC NEXT TIME?

38:42.567 --> 38:43.967
I DON'T THINK
EVERYBODY HEARD YOU!

38:44.067 --> 38:45.633
- WHAT?
- HEY, THERE'S MY BABY!

38:45.667 --> 38:46.800
- OH.
- HEY, LADIES.

38:46.833 --> 38:48.333
both: HI.
- HEY, COME HERE,

38:48.367 --> 38:51.167
I WANT YOU TO MEET
A FRIEND OF MINE, ALL RIGHT?

38:51.200 --> 38:53.500
LOOK AT HIM.
NOTHING BUT SWAG.

38:53.533 --> 38:55.433
CAN'T HELP
BUT LOVE THAT GUY.

38:55.467 --> 38:57.333
COME ON, COME ON.

38:57.367 --> 38:59.067
- MM-MM.

38:59.067 --> 39:01.433
- OH.

39:01.467 --> 39:04.433
[music playing]

39:04.467 --> 39:12.467
*

39:13.733 --> 39:16.167
- WOODY, CAN YOU
GET ME ANOTHER MOJITO, PLEASE?

39:16.200 --> 39:17.900
- NOTHING BUT A WORD.
- [chuckles]

39:23.200 --> 39:26.833
- [chuckles]

39:26.867 --> 39:28.367
SO WHO'S THAT YOU'RE WITH?

39:28.400 --> 39:31.233
- JUST A GUY.
- MM.

39:31.267 --> 39:33.400
- AND HER?
- JUST A GIRL.

39:33.433 --> 39:35.900
I CAN SEND HER HOME ANYTIME.

39:35.933 --> 39:37.367
- AND WHY WOULD
YOU WANNA DO THAT?

39:37.400 --> 39:38.900
- BECAUSE
I THOUGHT I MIGHT FINALLY

39:38.933 --> 39:41.067
LET YOU SLEEP WITH ME TONIGHT.
- WHAT?

39:41.067 --> 39:42.533
YOUR LITTLE DATE
WON'T DO THAT FOR YOU?

39:42.567 --> 39:44.433
- MM.
I HAVE A STRANGE FEELING

39:44.467 --> 39:46.667
SHE'D LET ME DO
JUST ABOUT ANYTHING

39:46.700 --> 39:49.733
THAT I WANT TO HER, KEISHA.
- MM-HMM.

39:49.767 --> 39:52.367
- BUT I'M PREOCCUPIED
BY SOMEONE ELSE.

39:52.400 --> 39:56.400
- OH, AND WHAT WOULD BE
IN IT FOR THAT SOMEONE ELSE?

39:56.433 --> 39:59.067
- BRAGGING RIGHTS.

39:59.067 --> 40:02.233
- OH.
CHILDREN BRAG.

40:02.267 --> 40:05.767
CALL ME WHEN YOU
WANNA KNOW WHAT WOMEN DO.

40:15.100 --> 40:17.167
- I SEE YOU KNOW MALCOLM.

40:17.200 --> 40:18.767
OF COURSE YOU DO,
HE'S BALLIN'.

40:18.800 --> 40:20.167
I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SEE

40:20.200 --> 40:21.167
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT MYSELF.

40:21.200 --> 40:22.600
YOU KNOW HOW WE DO.

40:22.633 --> 40:25.900
- WE DON'T DO ANYTHING ALIKE.

40:25.933 --> 40:27.667
BUT WE DO NEED TO
FINISH THE CONVERSATION

40:27.700 --> 40:29.067
ABOUT WHY M IN YOUR BOOK

40:29.100 --> 40:30.467
AND YOU DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME.

40:30.500 --> 40:31.833
- KEISHA,

40:31.867 --> 40:33.267
IN TEN YEARS,
WE'VE DONE, LIKE, WHAT?

40:33.300 --> 40:35.000
10, 15 VIDEOS TOGETHER?

40:35.033 --> 40:36.400
I KNOW A LOT.

40:36.433 --> 40:37.900
- DON'T PLAY GAMES WITH
ME, JASMINE.

40:37.933 --> 40:40.167
SAY WHAT YOU GOTTA SAY.

40:40.200 --> 40:42.667
- KEISHA,
IS EVERYTHING COOL?

40:42.700 --> 40:44.567
- I'M-A FIND OUT.

40:44.600 --> 40:46.000
SAY IT.

40:46.033 --> 40:48.000
- YOU SURE YOU
WANNA DO THIS RIGHT HERE?

40:49.367 --> 40:51.000
OKAY.

40:51.033 --> 40:54.267
I SAW YOU STEAL SEVERAL
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS' WORTH

40:54.300 --> 40:56.933
OF JEWELRY AND CASH.
SOUND FAMILIAR?

40:56.967 --> 40:59.433
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT RAPPERS,
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PARTIES.

40:59.467 --> 41:00.867
- WHAT IS
SHE TALKING ABOUT, KEISHA?

41:02.167 --> 41:04.067
- BEFORE
YOU ANSWER THAT...

41:04.067 --> 41:06.467
I ALREADY TALKED TO
THE GUY WHO FENCED IT FOR YOU.

41:06.500 --> 41:09.633
HE DESCRIBED YOU PERFECTLY.

41:09.667 --> 41:11.533
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
SUCH A MEMORABLE ASS.

41:11.567 --> 41:14.233
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE
NOT GONNA COME INTO MY STORE

41:14.267 --> 41:16.467
DURING MY PARTY
AND MESS WITH MY FRIEND.

41:16.500 --> 41:18.767
SO IF YOU'VE SAID
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO SAY,

41:18.800 --> 41:20.100
YOU CAN JUST STEP.

41:20.133 --> 41:22.533
- ACTUALLY,
THERE'S ONE LAST THING,

41:22.567 --> 41:25.200
THEN I'LL STEP.

41:25.233 --> 41:26.967
I'LL KEEP YOUR SECRET
FOR YOU,

41:27.067 --> 41:28.933
BUT YOU GOTTA DO
ONE LAST THING FOR ME

41:28.967 --> 41:30.433
AT CAM'RON'S VIDEO SHOOT.

41:30.467 --> 41:32.933
- I'M NOT STEALING
NO CASH, NO JEWELRY,

41:32.967 --> 41:34.767
NO NOTHING FOR NOBODY.

41:34.800 --> 41:36.200
I'M NOT A THIEF.

41:36.233 --> 41:37.933
- I'LL BE SURE
TO INCLUDE THAT QUOTE

41:37.967 --> 41:39.700
RIGHT UP
UNDER YOUR PICTURE.

41:39.733 --> 41:41.767
BUT I REALLY DON'T THINK

41:41.800 --> 41:44.167
THAT'S GONNA
SOUND TOO CONVINCING.

41:46.067 --> 41:48.233
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

41:48.267 --> 41:50.233
KEISHA,
WHAT IS GOING ON?

41:50.267 --> 41:53.633
WHOA.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

41:53.667 --> 41:56.133
- I JUST GOTTA SAY,
I'M NOT LOSING SLEEP...

41:56.167 --> 41:59.133
BUT IF I HAD STOPPED CALLING,
YOU'D HAVE MY PICTURE UP

41:59.167 --> 42:01.933
ON A DARTBOARD WITH ABOUT
50 HOLES IN MY HEAD BY NOW.

42:01.967 --> 42:04.600
SO BEFORE YOU
GET MAD AT THE NEXT DUDE

42:04.633 --> 42:08.067
FOR BOUNCING AFTER
HE BANGS YOU OR YOUR FRIENDS,

42:08.067 --> 42:09.667
JUST THINK
ABOUT HOW EASY IT IS.

42:09.700 --> 42:11.267
OKAY, I'M JUST SAYING.

42:11.300 --> 42:13.933
- OKAY, I'M SORRY,
ALL RIGHT?

42:13.967 --> 42:15.167
I JUST--
I FEEL ICKY.

42:15.200 --> 42:17.100
I FEEL LIKE
WE MOVED TOO FAST.

42:17.133 --> 42:19.067
- WE?

42:19.100 --> 42:20.533
COME ON, WE?

42:20.567 --> 42:22.267
- OKAY, ME.

42:22.300 --> 42:24.567
YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST
TRYING SOMETHING DIFFERENT,

42:24.600 --> 42:27.733
AND...TO SEE HOW IT FELT,
AND IT JUST...

42:27.767 --> 42:29.067
IT DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT.

42:29.067 --> 42:31.067
- HEY, I TRIED
TO BE THE NICE GUY.

42:31.067 --> 42:32.900
YOU DIDN'T WANT THAT.

42:36.133 --> 42:39.533
SO COME ON.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

42:39.567 --> 42:41.733
[clears throat]
- HOW ABOUT ONE LAST TIME?

42:41.767 --> 42:44.367
HMM?
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

42:44.400 --> 42:46.433
I HAVE A BETTER PLACE.
- YEAH?

42:46.467 --> 42:47.700
- YEAH.
LET'S GO.

42:49.867 --> 42:51.067
COME WITH ME.

42:51.067 --> 42:52.167
I WANNA
SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

42:52.200 --> 42:53.567
- WHAT?
- COME HERE.

42:53.600 --> 42:54.833
- WHAT IS IT?
- I'M GONNA SHOW YOU.

42:54.867 --> 42:56.700
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU.
- OKAY.

42:58.633 --> 43:01.400
- OUTSIDE, I WANNA SHOW YOU
SOMETHING OUTSIDE, OKAY?

43:01.433 --> 43:02.967
- ALL RIGHT, WELL--
- JUST GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES.

43:03.067 --> 43:05.233
FIVE MINUTES.
- HURRY UP, IT'S COLD OUT HERE.

43:05.267 --> 43:07.167
- YEAH, YOU COULD USE
THE COOLING OFF.

43:07.200 --> 43:09.833
- VAL!
COME ON!

43:09.867 --> 43:11.800
- OKAY, TACKY PATROL
IS HERE.

43:11.833 --> 43:13.400
NO SEX
DURING THIS PARTY.

43:13.433 --> 43:15.100
- TRUST ME,
I AM NOT GOING THERE.

43:15.133 --> 43:17.133
- COME ON, VAL, PLEASE!
LET ME IN.

43:17.167 --> 43:18.667
- OKAY, SPILL IT,

43:18.700 --> 43:20.400
WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON
WITH YOU TONIGHT, VAL?

43:20.433 --> 43:22.367
- I AM STRESSED
THE HELL OUT, OKAY?

43:22.400 --> 43:24.667
KEISHA'S BEING BLACKMAILED,
YOU'RE CHEATING ON YOUR HUSBAND,

43:24.700 --> 43:26.167
I HAD A ONE-NIGHT STAND,

43:26.200 --> 43:27.533
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
I'M PREGNANT!

43:27.567 --> 43:29.667
- OKAY, WHOA!
DRAMA OVERLOAD.

43:29.700 --> 43:32.167
BLACKMAILED?
- I'LL FILL YOU IN LATER.

43:32.200 --> 43:34.133
- PREGNANT, VAL?
both: WAIT.

43:34.167 --> 43:36.333
- YOU'RE HAVING SEX?
- WITH WHO?

43:36.367 --> 43:38.633
- ALL RIGHT,
THE JOKE IS UP, COME ON.

43:38.667 --> 43:40.467
- SHUT UP.
YOU AND THE WHITE BOY?

43:40.500 --> 43:41.733
- YES.
- [scoffs]

43:41.767 --> 43:43.533
IS THERE A FULL MOON
OR SOMETHING?

43:43.567 --> 43:45.133
'CAUSE THIS NIGHT
IS GETTING CRAZIER.

43:45.167 --> 43:46.900
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE
NOT JUST BEING PARANOID?

43:46.933 --> 43:49.667
- MY PERIOD IS LATE,
AND I TOOK ALL FIVE OF

43:49.700 --> 43:51.633
THOSE PREGNANCY TESTS
YOU HAVE UNDER THE SINK.

43:51.667 --> 43:53.200
THEY ALL SAID YES.

43:53.233 --> 43:55.500
- WHOO.

43:55.533 --> 43:57.867
- FINE, VAL.
HAVE A NICE LIFE.

43:57.900 --> 44:00.967
- AND ACTUALLY,
IT MIGHT NOT BE K.C.'S EITHER.

44:01.067 --> 44:02.733
- COME AGAIN?
- WELL...

44:02.767 --> 44:04.700
I KINDA SORTA
HAD ANOTHER SLIP-UP

44:04.733 --> 44:06.900
THAT I FORGOT TO MENTION.

44:06.933 --> 44:08.367
WITH QUINN.

44:08.400 --> 44:09.967
BUT IT
WAS JUST ONCE, OKAY?

44:10.067 --> 44:11.733
HE TOLD ME THAT
HE WAS NOT IN LOVE WITH ME.

44:11.767 --> 44:13.433
THAT HE WAS SETTLING
FOR ME.

44:13.467 --> 44:14.900
DO YOU KNOW
HOW THAT MADE ME FEEL?

44:14.933 --> 44:16.733
- APPARENTLY BAD ENOUGH
FOR YOU TO BONE HIM.

44:16.767 --> 44:19.133
- YES.
HE NEEDED TO KNOW

44:19.167 --> 44:20.867
THAT I COULD STILL
HAVE HIM IF I WANTED HIM.

44:20.900 --> 44:22.367
I HAD
TO HAVE THE LAST WORD.

44:22.400 --> 44:25.533
- OKAY, I GET THE EX SEX.
BUT I'M THINKING

44:25.567 --> 44:27.533
YOU MAY HAVE GOTTEN
SOMETHING BESIDES PREGNANT

44:27.567 --> 44:30.067
WHILE WAVING YOUR
ONE-WOMAN ANTI-CONDOM CAMPAIGN

44:30.067 --> 44:31.933
ALL AROUND ATLANTA!

44:31.967 --> 44:33.700
- I USED A CONDOM
WITH K.C.

44:33.733 --> 44:35.700
IT BROKE.
- OH.

44:35.733 --> 44:37.667
- AND THEN WITH QUINN,
I DON'T KNOW.

44:37.700 --> 44:39.667
WE JUST GOT ALL EMOTIONAL,
AND THEN THE NEXT THING I KNEW

44:39.700 --> 44:42.100
I WAS UP AGAINST THE WALL--
both: WE GOT IT.

44:42.133 --> 44:44.500
- YEAH.

44:44.533 --> 44:46.867
- DAMN, Y'ALL LOOK
LIKE Y'ALL COULD USE A DRINK.

44:46.900 --> 44:48.300
THEY'RE
LOOKING FOR YOU, VAL.

44:48.333 --> 44:49.833
MAYOR HOWARD WANTS
TO SEE YOU?

44:49.867 --> 44:51.633
- THE MAYOR?
HE DOESN'T KNOW ME.

44:51.667 --> 44:53.133
- MM-HMM.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

44:53.167 --> 44:54.733
- I'LL TAKE THAT DRINK.

44:54.767 --> 44:56.800
- OH.

44:56.833 --> 44:58.533
- [sighs]

45:03.467 --> 45:05.367
- THERE SHE IS.
COME ON OVER HERE.

45:05.400 --> 45:07.900
VAL, I HAVE TO COMMEND YOU
ON YOUR SUCCESS.

45:07.933 --> 45:09.467
THAT'S WHY I STARTED

45:09.500 --> 45:11.700
THE ATLANTA WOMEN'S
EMPOWERMENT INITIATIVE,

45:11.733 --> 45:13.700
SO WOMEN LIKE YOU CAN
START THEIR OWN BUSINESSES.

45:13.733 --> 45:16.800
IT'S IMPORTANT WE SUPPORT
EACH OTHER IN EVERY WAY WE CAN.

45:16.833 --> 45:19.400
- THANK YOU.
IT'S AN HONOR TO BE RECOGNIZED

45:19.433 --> 45:22.233
BY A MAN OF...
SUCH INTEGRITY.

45:22.267 --> 45:23.967
- HI, I'M KEISHA.

45:24.067 --> 45:25.433
I VOTED FOR YOU TWICE.

45:25.467 --> 45:27.633
- I HOPE I
HAVEN'T DISAPPOINTED YOU.

45:27.667 --> 45:29.733
- NO.
YOU'VE BEEN GREAT.

45:29.767 --> 45:32.067
- THANK YOU.
- [clears throat]

45:32.100 --> 45:34.133
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WE'RE GONNA GET OUT OF HERE.

45:34.167 --> 45:35.433
IT WAS GOOD SEEING YOU ALL.

45:35.467 --> 45:37.567
ONCE AGAIN,
CONGRATULATIONS, VAL.

45:37.600 --> 45:39.300
- THANK YOU.
- GOOD NIGHT TO EVERYONE.

45:39.333 --> 45:43.200
[applause]

45:43.233 --> 45:46.067
- [sighs]
WHAT A DOG!

45:46.067 --> 45:48.433
- YEAH,
BUT LOOK HOW HOT HE IS.

45:48.467 --> 45:51.467
- SAVE SOME BROTHERS
FOR US, PLEASE!

45:58.600 --> 46:01.567
- I'D BE DEEP IN
MY HANGOVER SLEEP RIGHT NOW

46:01.600 --> 46:05.200
IF SOMEONE WASN'T TOO CHEAP TO
HIRE A CLEANING SERVICE.

46:05.233 --> 46:06.700
- CLEANING CREWS COST.

46:06.733 --> 46:08.067
AND I'M HEMORRHAGING
MONEY EVERY WEEK

46:08.067 --> 46:09.867
JUST KEEPING
THE STORE RUNNING.

46:09.900 --> 46:14.200
SO IF YOU DON'T MIND,
THERE'S A BEER BY YOUR FOOT.

46:15.633 --> 46:17.367
- [soft grunt]

46:17.400 --> 46:19.100
- YOU KNOW
WHAT I CAN'T FIGURE OUT?

46:19.133 --> 46:21.133
IS HOW JASMINE POSSIBLY SAW ME
TAKE THOSE THINGS

46:21.167 --> 46:23.500
WHILE HER LEGS WERE SWUNG OVER
SOME DUDE'S SHOULDERS.

46:23.533 --> 46:25.467
- NO, MORE IMPORTANTLY,

46:25.500 --> 46:27.867
IS DO THE PEOPLE YOU STOLE FROM
KNOW WHERE YOU WORK?

46:27.900 --> 46:30.767
'CAUSE I CAN'T AFFORD
TO REPAIR THESE WINDOWS

46:30.800 --> 46:33.333
ONCE THEY GET ALL SHOT UP.
- IT WON'T COME TO THAT, SILLY.

46:33.367 --> 46:35.100
- MM.
- LOOK,

46:35.133 --> 46:36.700
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
PEOPLE IN THIS BUSINESS

46:36.733 --> 46:38.067
ARE VERY TACKY.

46:38.067 --> 46:39.867
THEY HAVE YOU
DO A TON OF WORK,

46:39.900 --> 46:42.200
AND WHEN IT'S TIME TO PAY UP
YOU CAN'T FIND THEM.

46:42.233 --> 46:44.267
IT'S HAPPENED TO YOU
WITH A FEW ARTISTS.

46:44.300 --> 46:48.133
SO WHEN IT HAPPENED TO ME,
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.

46:48.167 --> 46:49.900
- YEAH, SO HOW ARE
YOU GONNA GET OUTTA THIS?

46:49.933 --> 46:52.067
- I DON'T KNOW.

46:52.067 --> 46:54.800
I'M STILL TOO HUNG OVER
TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT MY LIFE.

46:54.833 --> 46:56.300
LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR LIFE

46:56.333 --> 46:58.367
AND HOW MANY
STICKS YOU'RE GONNA PEE ON.

47:01.667 --> 47:03.933
YOU'RE PREGNANT, HON.

47:03.967 --> 47:07.067
LET'S DEAL WITH THAT.

47:07.067 --> 47:08.500
- GOOD MORNING.

47:08.533 --> 47:11.100
I BROUGHT CROISSANTS.

47:11.133 --> 47:12.367
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

47:12.400 --> 47:14.067
YOU KNOW,
I ALWAYS SAID,

47:14.067 --> 47:15.833
IF I GOT PREGNANT
AND I WASN'T READY,

47:15.867 --> 47:17.633
I WOULD HAVE AN ABORTION.

47:17.667 --> 47:19.867
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
WHEN IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS.

47:19.900 --> 47:22.233
- SO WAIT,
YOU'RE GONNA KEEP IT?

47:23.867 --> 47:26.167
- WELL, MY INSTINCT
ISN'T TO SAY NO.

47:26.200 --> 47:28.800
- WHAT?

47:28.833 --> 47:30.833
- TRUST ME,
I AM JUST AS SURPRISED

47:30.867 --> 47:33.867
TO HEAR ME SAY THIS
AS YOU ARE.

47:33.900 --> 47:37.267
BUT I THOUGHT ABOUT IT
ALL NIGHT.

47:37.300 --> 47:39.967
AND I THINK...

47:40.067 --> 47:42.067
I JUST MIGHT HAVE A BABY.

47:47.400 --> 47:49.333
OH, THAT'S
THE THIRD TIME THIS WEEK.

47:49.367 --> 47:51.300
I HAVE
TO CALL AN ELECTRICIAN.

47:51.333 --> 47:53.600
OH, GOD,
WHEN IT RAINS, IT POURS.

47:53.633 --> 47:56.467
- LOOK, HAVING A BABY
IS NO JOKE.

47:56.500 --> 47:58.933
IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO
RAISE A CHILD,

47:58.967 --> 48:00.767
AND I AM NOT
VILLAGE MATERIAL RIGHT NOW.

48:00.800 --> 48:02.533
- YEAH, BUT IT COULD BE
THE BEST THING

48:02.567 --> 48:04.500
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO YOU.
- YEAH, IF IT'S QUINN'S,

48:04.533 --> 48:06.967
'CAUSE THAT BASKETBALL MONEY
WOULD BE REALLY CUTE.

48:07.067 --> 48:08.900
- AND IF IT'S K.C.'S?

48:08.933 --> 48:12.933
- THE BOTTOM LINE IS,
IT'S YOURS.

48:12.967 --> 48:15.133
AS MUCH AS I TEASE YOU,
YOU KNOW I GOT YOUR BACK.

48:15.167 --> 48:19.133
YOU JUST GOTTA DO
WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU.

48:19.167 --> 48:20.500
- VAL,
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW,

48:20.533 --> 48:24.467
I SUPPORT
WHATEVER YOU WANNA DO.

48:24.500 --> 48:26.400
IS THIS TOO SEXY
FOR 10:00 A.M.?

48:26.433 --> 48:28.833
- HMM.
HAVING BREAKFAST WITH THE MAYOR?

48:28.867 --> 48:31.933
- ACTUALLY, I'M HEADED TO COURT
WHERE I'M GONNA BE BREAKFAST.

48:31.967 --> 48:33.500
- COURT?
IT'S SUNDAY MORNING.

48:33.533 --> 48:34.833
- UH-HUH,
HE'S GONNA HAVE AN OFFICER

48:34.867 --> 48:36.300
OPEN UP THE BUILDING FOR US,

48:36.333 --> 48:38.267
AND WE ARE GONNA
DO IT ON THE WITNESS STAND.

48:38.300 --> 48:40.067
AND I SWEAR,
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH,

48:40.067 --> 48:42.400
THE WHOLE TRUTH,
AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH!

48:42.433 --> 48:44.433
[laughing]
- WAIT A SECOND.

48:44.467 --> 48:46.367
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT
KNOWS ABOUT THIS?

48:46.400 --> 48:48.400
YOU GUYS ARE GETTING
A LITTLE OUT-OF-HAND.

48:48.433 --> 48:50.100
OKAY, AND YOU KNOW I TAKE ON
OTHER PEOPLE'S STRESS,

48:50.133 --> 48:51.833
SO I REALLY NEED YOU
TO BE CAREFUL.

48:51.867 --> 48:53.967
DO NOT LET HIS SHADY ASS

48:54.067 --> 48:55.800
GET YOU CAUGHT
IN A PUBLIC SCANDAL

48:55.833 --> 48:58.067
THAT WILL COST YOU YOUR
REPUTATION AND YOUR MARRIAGE.

48:58.100 --> 49:01.067
[horn honking]

49:01.100 --> 49:04.067
- THAT'S HIM, SO.

49:04.067 --> 49:05.267
I GOTTA GO.

49:09.633 --> 49:12.933
- THAT'S A SHAME.
- ISN'T IT?

49:12.967 --> 49:14.967
- HOW'D SHE GET HIM
AND WE DIDN'T?

49:19.467 --> 49:21.533
- OH.

49:21.567 --> 49:24.067
THAT'S A REALLY PRETTY DRESS.
- THANK YOU.

49:24.067 --> 49:26.900
- IT'S GONNA LOOK
EVEN BETTER ON THE FLOOR.

49:26.933 --> 49:29.600

49:55.900 --> 49:57.833

49:57.867 --> 50:02.167
ALL RIGHT.
- WHOO.

50:02.200 --> 50:05.067
- HOW DID I BECOME ONE OF
THOSE WOMEN ON MAURY POVICH

50:05.100 --> 50:06.967
WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHO
THE FATHER OF HER CHILD IS?

50:07.000 --> 50:08.833
- I LOVE THAT SHOW.

50:08.867 --> 50:10.467
- OMAR,
I HAD SEX WITH TWO MEN

50:10.500 --> 50:12.267
IN A VERY
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

50:12.300 --> 50:14.633
THAT IS BORDERLINE
PORN STAR BEHAVIOR.

50:14.667 --> 50:16.567
- SO YOU HAD
A COUPLE OF SLUTTY MOMENTS.

50:16.600 --> 50:18.200
AT LEAST YOU CAN STILL COUNT

50:18.233 --> 50:19.833
THE MEN YOU'VE BEEN WITH
ON ONE HAND.

50:19.867 --> 50:22.067
I CAN'T DO THAT.

50:22.100 --> 50:25.200
LOOK, YOU'RE A GOOD WOMAN,
DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP.

50:25.233 --> 50:28.300
- AW.
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO LIKE MEN?

50:28.333 --> 50:30.333
HELL, WHY DO I
HAVE TO LIKE MEN?

50:30.367 --> 50:32.233
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I HATE MEN.

50:32.267 --> 50:33.667
- YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN
ON THAT ONE.

50:35.567 --> 50:36.833
- MM, HEY.

50:36.867 --> 50:38.567
WHO THE HELL'S
WEARING THIS?

50:38.600 --> 50:41.467
- UH...THAT WOULD BE YOU.

50:41.500 --> 50:43.333
THE MILF.
- THE WHAT?

50:43.367 --> 50:45.800
- THAT'S AN OLD--
- I KNOW WHAT IT IS,

50:45.833 --> 50:49.533
AND IT MEANS I'M STILL HOT.
SHUT UP, OMAR.

50:49.567 --> 50:51.567
HOW'S MY ASS LOOK?
I JUST FELT SOMETHING JIGGLE

50:51.600 --> 50:53.367
THAT I'VE NEVER
FELT JIGGLE BEFORE.

50:53.400 --> 50:55.667
- YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M NOT
GONNA TELL EITHER ONE OF THEM.

50:55.700 --> 50:57.300
NOPE.
- OH, HELL NO.

50:57.333 --> 50:59.167
YOU STILL TALKING
ABOUT DOING THIS BY YOURSELF?

50:59.200 --> 51:01.233
VAL, YOU'RE NOT
THE SINGLE PARENT TYPE.

51:01.267 --> 51:03.200
YOU GOTTA LET BOTH OF THEM
KNOW AT LEAST ONE OF THEM

51:03.233 --> 51:04.700
IS ABOUT TO BE A DADDY.
- OH, YEAH.

51:04.733 --> 51:06.133
AND HOW'S THAT GONNA SOUND?

51:06.167 --> 51:08.767
"HEY, K.C., GUESS WHAT,
I'M PREGNANT!

51:08.800 --> 51:11.300
"WAIT, DON'T RUN.
IT MIGHT NOT BE YOURS.

51:11.333 --> 51:12.800
"SEE, I HAD SEX
WITH MY EX-BOYFRIEND.

51:12.833 --> 51:15.100
AND DID I MENTION
HE'S ENGAGED?"

51:15.133 --> 51:16.600
- MM.
- YEAH.

51:16.633 --> 51:18.333
IT'S BEEN
A VERY BUSY WEEK FOR ME.

51:18.367 --> 51:20.800
- SO YOUR CHILD DOESN'T GET
TO KNOW ITS FATHER

51:20.833 --> 51:22.767
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE
THE WAY THE TRUTH SOUNDED?

51:22.800 --> 51:24.600
- I UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU DON'T WANNA TELL QUINN.

51:24.633 --> 51:27.500
HE'S AN ASS.
BUT WHY NOT K.C.?

51:27.533 --> 51:28.967
- OH, WHAT AM
I SUPPOSED TO DO?

51:29.067 --> 51:30.800
JUST BLURT IT OUT?
I MEAN, SHOULDN'T I

51:30.833 --> 51:32.633
AT LEAST GET TO KNOW
THE GUY A LITTLE BIT FIRST?

51:32.667 --> 51:34.533
- SO NOW YOU
HAVE GOOD REASON TO.

51:34.567 --> 51:36.467
NEXT TIME DO IT
THE OTHER WAY AROUND, THOUGH.

51:36.500 --> 51:37.700
HUH? HUH?
- [chuckles]

51:37.733 --> 51:39.800
- AH,
THERE'S THAT SMILE.

51:39.833 --> 51:41.467
NOW COME ON, PLEASE.

51:41.500 --> 51:42.867
SOMEBODY TELL ME.
HOW DOES MY ASS LOOK?

51:44.300 --> 51:46.333
- YOU'RE GOOD, MAMA.
BELIEVE THAT.

51:46.367 --> 51:48.433
- THERE YOU GO.

51:48.467 --> 51:50.467
- YOU ALL RIGHT.

51:50.500 --> 51:53.067
- HOW YOU DOIN',
YOU ALL RIGHT?

51:53.067 --> 51:54.867
KEISH...
WHAT UP, GIRL?

51:54.900 --> 51:56.167
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU?
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

51:56.200 --> 51:57.667
YOU ALL RIGHT?
- I'M GOOD, MM.

51:57.700 --> 51:58.833
- THIS IS MY MAN, V,
RIGHT HERE.

51:58.867 --> 52:00.267
- HEY, V, HOW YOU DOING?

52:00.300 --> 52:01.733
- DAMN, YOU LOOKING GOOD,
BABY GIRL.

52:01.767 --> 52:03.700
I KNOW WE HANGING OUT
AFTER THE VIDEO.

52:03.733 --> 52:05.500
WE GOT SOME CATCHING UP TO DO.
- I WISH I COULD,

52:05.533 --> 52:06.933
BUT I GOT SOMETHING
IN THE MORNING,

52:06.967 --> 52:08.433
AND I GOTTA
GET MY BEAUTY REST.

52:08.467 --> 52:09.800
BUT I'LL SEE YOU
AT THE CLUB SATURDAY, RIGHT?

52:09.833 --> 52:11.067
- FOR SURE.
- COOL.

52:11.067 --> 52:12.233
both: ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT.

52:12.267 --> 52:13.600
- ALL RIGHT.

52:13.633 --> 52:17.067
- [chuckles]

52:34.800 --> 52:36.333
HEY, BIG MIKE.

52:40.267 --> 52:42.967
WHAT'S UP?

52:50.933 --> 52:53.933
WHAT'S UP?

53:07.933 --> 53:09.933
[knocking]

53:11.900 --> 53:14.267
- HI.
- YOU KNOW, TECHNICALLY,

53:14.300 --> 53:15.600
I SHOULDN'T EVEN
BE SPEAKING TO YOU.

53:15.633 --> 53:19.167
- YES, I KNOW.
AND I'M SORRY.

53:19.200 --> 53:21.233
THAT'S WHY
I'M EXTENDING AN OLIVE BRANCH.

53:21.267 --> 53:23.733
- I'D PREFER THAT SIX-PACK
OF BREW YOU PROMISED.

53:23.767 --> 53:25.733
- OH, YOU WERE
SERIOUS ABOUT THAT?

53:25.767 --> 53:29.100
- [scoffs]
- I'M KIDDING.

53:29.133 --> 53:31.900
IT'S IN THE FRIDGE,
AND I ORDERED PIZZA.

53:31.933 --> 53:34.300
COME BACK.

53:37.300 --> 53:40.533
- SO, I GOTTA ASK.

53:42.067 --> 53:45.067
IS THIS A BOOTY CALL
OR A FRIENDLY CALL?

53:45.100 --> 53:47.300
I GOTTA MAKE SURE
WITH YOU.

53:47.333 --> 53:49.267
- IT'S LIKE I SAID
ON THE PHONE.

53:49.300 --> 53:52.300
I WAS A JERK TO YOU,
AND THAT'S NOT MY STYLE.

53:52.333 --> 53:54.633
SO IF YOU'RE WILLING,

53:54.667 --> 53:56.500
I'D LIKE
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

53:56.533 --> 53:58.567
START OVER.
BE FRIENDS.

53:58.600 --> 54:00.267
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

54:00.300 --> 54:02.467
- ALL RIGHT.

54:02.500 --> 54:05.300
FRIEND?

54:05.333 --> 54:06.867
DEAL.
- OKAY.

54:06.900 --> 54:09.800
[glass clinks]

54:09.833 --> 54:12.600
DO YOU WANNA SIT DOWN?
- YEAH.

54:12.633 --> 54:14.233
- OKAY.

54:14.267 --> 54:18.200
- SO WHY THE SUDDEN CHANGE
OF HEART?

54:18.233 --> 54:20.067
- I'M TRYING TO GET TO
KNOW YOU BETTER.

54:20.100 --> 54:21.433
- WHAT DO YOU WANNA KNOW?

54:21.467 --> 54:23.933
- DO YOU USUALLY DATE
BLACK WOMEN?

54:23.967 --> 54:25.700
OR AM I AN EXCEPTION?

54:25.733 --> 54:27.133
- YOU'RE JUST
GONNA START RIGHT OFF

54:27.167 --> 54:28.700
WITH
THE HARD QUESTIONS, HUH?

54:28.733 --> 54:32.067
I'M NOT JOHN MAYER.
I DATE WOMEN OF ALL COLOR.

54:32.067 --> 54:34.833
I'M ALL ABOUT EQUAL OPPORTUNITY
IN THE BEDROOM.

54:34.867 --> 54:37.100
OBVIOUSLY.

54:37.133 --> 54:39.067
- I MEAN, HAVE YOU
EVER TAKEN A BLACK WOMAN

54:39.067 --> 54:40.700
HOME TO YOUR PARENTS?

54:40.733 --> 54:43.100
- THAT'S LIKE A THIRD BEER
KIND OF QUESTION.

54:43.133 --> 54:44.767
UM, CAN WE
START WITH THE BASICS?

54:44.800 --> 54:48.300
LIKE, WHERE I'M FROM,
OR HOW OLD I AM?

54:48.333 --> 54:50.100
- LOOK, I'VE NEVER DATED
A WHITE GUY.

54:50.133 --> 54:53.767
SO THESE ARE INNOCENT
GET-TO-KNOW-YOU QUESTIONS.

54:53.800 --> 54:56.867
JUST BE HONEST.

54:56.900 --> 54:59.567
- OKAY.

54:59.600 --> 55:01.900
IN HIGH SCHOOL, I BROUGHT
A BLACK GIRL TO THE PROM

55:01.933 --> 55:03.667
AND MY PARENTS REFUSED TO
PUT THE PICTURES UP

55:03.700 --> 55:07.933
WITH ALL THE OTHERS.

55:07.967 --> 55:09.900
- HOW ARE THEY NOW?

55:09.933 --> 55:14.067
- MY MOM WATCHES OPRAH.

55:14.067 --> 55:16.067
OH, GREAT.
UM...[clears throat]

55:16.100 --> 55:17.733
I FEEL LIKE
I'M IN THE HOT SEAT.

55:17.767 --> 55:20.733
- OKAY.
YOU ASK ME A QUESTION.

55:20.767 --> 55:22.300
- CAN WE
WATCH THE UFC FIGHT

55:22.333 --> 55:24.567
AND GET BACK TO GETTING
TO KNOW EACH OTHER LATER?

55:24.600 --> 55:27.800
- OKAY, YEAH.
BUT I WANTED TO WATCH A MOVIE.

55:27.833 --> 55:30.267
- YEAH, WHAT'S THIS?
WE COULD WATCH...

55:30.300 --> 55:34.100
LOVE JONES.
PROBABLY NEVER.

55:34.133 --> 55:37.167
- OKAY, UFC IT IS.

55:42.867 --> 55:46.567
- HOW'S YOUR LOBSTER?
- MM, IT'S GOOD.

55:46.600 --> 55:49.233
IT'S MY FAVORITE.
- GOOD, YEAH.

55:49.267 --> 55:52.833
[sighs]

56:00.933 --> 56:03.400
HONEY, LOOK...

56:03.433 --> 56:07.900
I THINK WE NEED
TO GO ON A VACATION.

56:07.933 --> 56:10.900
I THOUGHT I MIGHT TAKE YOU
ON THE FRENCH RIVIERA.

56:10.933 --> 56:12.900
WE COULD RENT A VILLA,

56:12.933 --> 56:15.067
SPEND ALL DAY IN BED,

56:15.100 --> 56:16.500
START MAKING SOME BABIES...

56:18.267 --> 56:19.567
- BABIES?

56:19.600 --> 56:21.900
- COME ON,
YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN DYING

56:21.933 --> 56:24.233
TO START A FAMILY
FOR A FEW YEARS NOW.

56:24.267 --> 56:25.933
I'VE BEEN READY.

56:25.967 --> 56:28.733
COME ON, THE ONLY QUESTION
IS WHEN YOU'RE GONNA BE.

56:30.600 --> 56:33.067
- DO WE HAVE TO
TALK ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW?

56:33.067 --> 56:34.600
- WHY NOT NOW?

56:34.633 --> 56:36.800
WE'RE NOT GETTING
ANY YOUNGER, APRIL.

56:36.833 --> 56:38.767
AND I WANT
AT LEAST THREE KIDS.

56:38.800 --> 56:40.533
- DARRYL, PLEASE,
RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST--

56:40.567 --> 56:41.933
IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME.

56:41.967 --> 56:43.267
- FOR THE BABY
OR THE DISCUSSION?

56:43.300 --> 56:45.067
- BOTH.

56:45.100 --> 56:47.467
- [sighs]

56:47.500 --> 56:49.767
- LOOK, NO.
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

56:49.800 --> 56:52.300
I'M SORRY.
LISTEN,

56:52.333 --> 56:57.133
IN A YEAR OR TWO, WE CAN
SERIOUSLY DISCUSS IT, OKAY?

56:57.167 --> 57:00.533
- FINE.

57:00.567 --> 57:03.600
BUT I'M NOT GONNA
WAIT TOO MUCH LONGER, APRIL.

57:17.367 --> 57:18.933
- [clears throat]

57:18.967 --> 57:20.767
I GOTTA GO TO THE BATHROOM.
I'LL BE BACK.

57:32.233 --> 57:33.367
[whispers]
TREVOR!

57:33.400 --> 57:34.767
- HEY.
- WHAT THE HELL

57:34.800 --> 57:36.100
ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- I HAD TO SEE YOU.

57:36.133 --> 57:37.233
I HAD TO.
- NO, IT'S TOO RISKY.

57:37.267 --> 57:39.067
- NO, NO.
- NO, UM, GEE,

57:39.100 --> 57:41.167
WHO IS THAT STRANGE WOMAN
MAKING OUT WITH THE MAYOR?

57:41.200 --> 57:42.833
GET A GRIP!
- LOOK, LOOK, LOOK. COME HERE.

57:42.867 --> 57:44.333
- WHAT?

57:44.367 --> 57:46.567
- I WANNA KNOW SOMETHING.

57:46.600 --> 57:48.367
- WHAT?

57:48.400 --> 57:49.900
- ARE YOU STILL
SLEEPING WITH HIM?

57:49.933 --> 57:52.567
- WITH WHO?
- YOUR HUSBAND.

57:52.600 --> 57:54.900
- OF COURSE I'M SLEEPING
WITH HIM; HE'S MY HUSBAND.

57:54.933 --> 57:57.167
- WELL, I WANT YOU
TO STOP.

57:57.200 --> 58:00.700
I DON'T WANNA SHARE YOU.
- [soft moans]

58:00.733 --> 58:02.533
- AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR WIFE?

58:02.567 --> 58:04.467
YOU GONNA STOP
SLEEPING WITH HER?

58:04.500 --> 58:06.467
- I ALREADY HAVE.

58:06.500 --> 58:10.767
- WELL...
I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO.

58:10.800 --> 58:13.467
- I WANTED TO.
AND IF I'M NOT SLEEPING

58:13.500 --> 58:15.933
WITH ANYBODY ELSE,
I DON'T WANT YOU TO EITHER.

58:15.967 --> 58:19.567
I TOLD YOU,
I WANT THIS TO BE MINE.

58:19.600 --> 58:23.167
- OKAY, WHOA.
SLOW DOWN, DUDE.

58:26.633 --> 58:28.633
NO.
NO!

58:28.667 --> 58:32.300
- HEY...

58:37.900 --> 58:39.367
- THERE YOU ARE.

58:39.400 --> 58:42.867
I WAS ABOUT TO SEND OUT
A SEARCH PARTY.

58:42.900 --> 58:44.333
HONEY, IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

58:44.367 --> 58:47.767
- HUH? YES.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

58:47.800 --> 58:49.933
LET'S JUST FINISH.

58:49.967 --> 58:52.667
- APRIL, I'M NOT STUPID.

58:52.700 --> 58:54.933
SOMETHING JUST HAPPENED.
TALK TO ME.

58:54.967 --> 58:56.667
- NOTHING, BABY.

58:56.700 --> 58:58.433
- APRIL.
- HMM?

58:58.467 --> 59:00.267
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

59:02.267 --> 59:04.333
- VAL IS PREGNANT
WITH QUINN'S BABY.

59:04.367 --> 59:07.833
- WHAT?
BUT AREN'T THEY--?

59:07.867 --> 59:10.300
- YEAH, SHE CALLED ME
WHEN I WAS IN THE BATHROOM

59:10.333 --> 59:13.100
AND I GUESS HER AND QUINN
HOOKED UP

59:13.133 --> 59:16.300
AND NOW SHE'S PREGNANT,
YOU KNOW, AND SHE WAS CRYING,

59:16.333 --> 59:18.067
AND, YOU KNOW,
WHEN MY GIRL GETS UPSET,

59:18.067 --> 59:20.067
I GET UPSET AND I'M JUST,
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST--

59:20.067 --> 59:22.667
I'M--I'M REALLY--

WOW. I HAVEN'T HEARD YOU
SAY THAT IN YEARS.

1:09:19.333 --> 1:09:22.067
- I SAID "KIND OF."
LET'S NOT GET CARRIED AWAY.

1:09:22.067 --> 1:09:23.400
- HMM.

1:09:23.433 --> 1:09:24.733
- BUT IF HE
FINDS OUT THE TRUTH,

1:09:24.767 --> 1:09:26.167
HE'S GONNA THINK
I'M SCANDALOUS,

1:09:26.200 --> 1:09:28.067
LIKE I GO AROUND
ROBBING RICH GUYS.

1:09:28.100 --> 1:09:29.900
HE'S NOT GONNA GET
MY REASONS.

1:09:29.933 --> 1:09:31.367
I MEAN, WHO WOULD?

1:09:31.400 --> 1:09:32.633
- SO WHAT DID YOU DO?

1:09:32.667 --> 1:09:34.667
- I LEFT.

1:09:34.700 --> 1:09:37.467
I COULDN'T EVEN
LOOK AT HIM.

1:09:37.500 --> 1:09:39.233
AND YOU KNOW I GOT
A GREAT POKER FACE.

1:09:39.267 --> 1:09:40.633
I CAN HANG
WITH THE BEST OF 'EM.

1:09:40.667 --> 1:09:43.967
BUT I KEPT THINKING,
THIS ISN'T 1998.

1:09:44.067 --> 1:09:46.800
THAT MAN DIDN'T DOG ME OUT.

1:09:46.833 --> 1:09:49.067
MALCOLM DIDN'T
DO ME DIRTY.

1:09:49.067 --> 1:09:50.967
UHH!

1:09:51.067 --> 1:09:53.300
WHY DID I LET MYSELF
STOOP SO LOW?

1:09:53.333 --> 1:09:55.067
- I HATE TO KICK YOU
WHEN YOU'RE DOWN,

1:09:55.100 --> 1:09:57.133
BUT THAT
WAS REALLY STUPID,

1:09:57.167 --> 1:09:59.567
THEN AND ESPECIALLY NOW.

1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:03.733
- I KNOW.

1:10:03.767 --> 1:10:05.733
IT JUST MAKES ME
ASK MYSELF,

1:10:05.767 --> 1:10:07.667
WHY AM I DOING
THE SAME THINGS I WAS

1:10:07.700 --> 1:10:10.000
BACK IN THE DAY?

1:10:10.033 --> 1:10:11.733
DANCING IN VIDEOS
IN TOO LITTLE CLOTHES

1:10:11.767 --> 1:10:13.400
FOR TOO LITTLE MONEY.

1:10:13.433 --> 1:10:17.733
- HMM, I'VE BEEN TRYING TO
TELL YOU THAT DELICATELY

1:10:17.767 --> 1:10:20.367
FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:23.067
- SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA
KEEP ON KICKING, HUH?

1:10:23.100 --> 1:10:26.467
- I'M YOUR FRIEND.

1:10:26.500 --> 1:10:30.100
I'M ALWAYS GONNA KEEP IT
100 WITH YOU.

1:10:30.133 --> 1:10:32.967
- [takes deep breath]

1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:36.533
SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE.

1:10:36.567 --> 1:10:39.433
IT'S TIME TO BE A BIG GIRL
AND MAKE SOME CHANGES.

1:10:39.467 --> 1:10:43.233
- HMM. WE ALL NEED
A WAKE-UP CALL NOW AND THEN.

1:10:43.267 --> 1:10:45.533
I GOT ONE TOO.

1:10:45.567 --> 1:10:46.700
- YEAH?

1:10:46.733 --> 1:10:48.033
- THE ELECTRICIAN
CAME BY.

1:10:48.067 --> 1:10:50.467
THE ENTIRE STORE
NEEDS TO BE REWIRED.

1:10:50.500 --> 1:10:53.567
SO I DROVE AROUND
THE CITY TODAY

1:10:53.600 --> 1:10:55.133
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS,
SAYING GOOD-BYE

1:10:55.167 --> 1:10:57.400
TO THE JAG I COULD NEVER AFFORD
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

1:10:57.433 --> 1:10:59.733
- I'M SURPRISED
IT TOOK THIS LONG

1:10:59.767 --> 1:11:01.267
FOR YOU TO REALIZE THAT.

1:11:01.300 --> 1:11:04.300
- I MEAN, WHY DO I NEED
A CAR TO VALIDATE ME

1:11:04.333 --> 1:11:06.700
WHEN I CAN JUST
LOOK AT MY RESUME?

1:11:06.733 --> 1:11:08.167
- THAT'S RIGHT.

1:11:08.200 --> 1:11:11.833
LOOK AT ALL
WHAT YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED.

1:11:11.867 --> 1:11:14.200
YOU GOT THIS.
- YEP.

1:11:14.233 --> 1:11:18.200
ME, MY STORE, AND THIS BABY
ARE GOING TO BE JUST FINE.

1:11:18.233 --> 1:11:19.833
AND WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT,

1:11:19.867 --> 1:11:21.533
THE WHOLE
LOVE/RELATIONSHIP THING

1:11:21.567 --> 1:11:25.600
WILL WORK ITSELF OUT
FOR ME TOO.

1:11:25.633 --> 1:11:27.233
- THIS WOULD BE
THE PART WHERE YOU SAY

1:11:27.267 --> 1:11:29.067
KEISHA'S ALSO
GONNA BE FINE.

1:11:29.100 --> 1:11:31.833
HELLO? CAN I GET A LITTLE
ENCOURAGEMENT HERE, PLEASE?

1:11:31.867 --> 1:11:33.700
- OH, YES, OF COURSE.

1:11:33.733 --> 1:11:35.067
BABY, YOU'RE GONNA BE
JUST FINE.

1:11:35.100 --> 1:11:37.100
- OH, SHUT UP.
IT'S TOO LATE NOW.

1:11:46.967 --> 1:11:49.067
- HI, OMAR.
- HEY.

1:11:49.067 --> 1:11:50.767
YOU'RE IN A GOOD MOOD.

1:11:50.800 --> 1:11:52.600
DID YOU GET LUCKY
WITH ANOTHER CUSTOMER?

1:11:52.633 --> 1:11:54.433
- HA HA. NO.

1:11:54.467 --> 1:11:57.500
I TOOK THE JAG BACK AND THEY
STILL HAD MY OLD CAR.

1:11:57.533 --> 1:12:00.333
- YOU TOOK THE JAG BACK?
DAMN!

1:12:00.367 --> 1:12:02.333
- NOW DON'T SLEEP
ON THE HOOPTY.

1:12:02.367 --> 1:12:05.567
MS. KIKI IS VERY RELIABLE.

1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:07.900
- YEAH, BUT IT'S GONNA
BE SO MUCH HARDER

1:12:07.933 --> 1:12:09.800
TO PICK UP STRAIGHT BOYS
IN THAT.

1:12:09.833 --> 1:12:13.600
BUT I'VE MANAGED
THIS LONG.

1:12:13.633 --> 1:12:16.133
- HEY, VAL.

1:12:16.167 --> 1:12:18.067
- OH, HI, DARRYL.
HOW ARE YOU?

1:12:18.067 --> 1:12:20.800
- JUST WORKING HARD,
YOU KNOW. YOU?

1:12:20.833 --> 1:12:25.167
- BUSY, BUSY.
- I CAN IMAGINE.

1:12:25.200 --> 1:12:28.400
- ARE YOU--ARE YOU
SHOPPING FOR YOURSELF?

1:12:28.433 --> 1:12:30.067
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
THAT'S YOUR STYLE.

1:12:30.100 --> 1:12:32.467
- I-I--NO, NO. I'M JUST
WAITING FOR APRIL.

1:12:32.500 --> 1:12:33.733
SHE IN THE BATHROOM
OR SOMETHING?

1:12:33.767 --> 1:12:37.700
- WHAT? NO.
APRIL ISN'T HERE.

1:12:37.733 --> 1:12:39.733
- WHAT? I JUST TALKED TO HER
TEN MINUTES AGO.

1:12:39.767 --> 1:12:42.233
SHE SAID SHE WAS HERE
WITH YOU.

1:12:42.267 --> 1:12:45.067
- WELL, SHE WAS HERE.
SHE WAS.

1:12:45.100 --> 1:12:46.533
BUT SHE JUST LEFT.

1:12:46.567 --> 1:12:49.133
I MEAN, YOU MUST HAVE
JUST MISSED HER.

1:12:49.167 --> 1:12:51.133
YOU DIDN'T SEE HER OUT THERE?
- NO.

1:12:51.167 --> 1:12:52.800
- THAT'S CRAZY,
BECAUSE SHE WAS

1:12:52.833 --> 1:12:55.233
JUST STANDING RIGHT HERE,
RIGHT?

1:12:55.267 --> 1:12:57.800
- YEP, I SAW HER
STANDING OVER THERE TOO.

1:12:57.833 --> 1:13:00.600
- WE WERE ON OUR CELLS BUT
HER PHONE KEPT DROPPING ME,

1:13:00.633 --> 1:13:01.800
SO I JUST DECIDED
I'D COME BY HERE

1:13:01.833 --> 1:13:02.967
AND SEE IF I COULD
CATCH HER.

1:13:03.067 --> 1:13:04.533
- CATCH HER HERE?
NO, MM-MM.

1:13:04.567 --> 1:13:06.467
I MEAN,
BECAUSE SHE JUST LEFT.

1:13:06.500 --> 1:13:09.933
- WHY WOULDN'T SHE JUST CALL
AND TELL ME SHE WAS LEAVING?

1:13:09.967 --> 1:13:11.600
- YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

1:13:11.633 --> 1:13:14.767
I ASKED HER TO RUN
A QUICK ERRAND FOR ME TO FEDEX,

1:13:14.800 --> 1:13:16.300
BUT I WILL JUST CALL HER
RIGHT NOW

1:13:16.333 --> 1:13:18.200
AND TELL HER TO COME
RIGHT BACK, OKAY?

1:13:18.233 --> 1:13:20.133
- VAL, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I'LL CALL HER.

1:13:20.167 --> 1:13:22.300
- NO, I'LL JUST CALL.
- THAT'S OKAY.

1:13:22.333 --> 1:13:25.600
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YEAH, YEAH. UM, THANKS.

1:13:25.633 --> 1:13:27.767
- OKAY, BYE.
- BYE.

- [laughs]

1:13:30.333 --> 1:13:32.300
UNBELIEVABLE.

OH.

OH, MM-HMM.

1:14:01.133 --> 1:14:03.233
STOP.

SO TENSE LATELY

1:14:06.800 --> 1:14:10.867
AND THINGS HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE OFF BETWEEN US,

1:14:10.900 --> 1:14:12.900
BUT WE'RE GONNA
KEEP TRYING

1:14:12.933 --> 1:14:16.100
BECAUSE I'M NOT
GIVING UP ON US.

1:14:21.067 --> 1:14:25.067
- YOU REALLY ARE
A WONDERFUL HUSBAND,

1:14:25.067 --> 1:14:26.733
AND I LOVE YOU.

1:14:26.767 --> 1:14:29.200

STOP DESIGNING

THOSE MATERNITY CLOTHES NOW.

1:15:13.133 --> 1:15:14.767
- WHY DIDN'T I GO
TO THE DOCTOR

1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:16.433
AND GET A PROFESSIONAL PREGNANCY
TEST IN THE FIRST PLACE?

1:15:16.467 --> 1:15:18.167
- YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE WAITED
UNTIL TODAY.

1:15:18.200 --> 1:15:19.967
YOU COULD HAVE SAVED YOURSELF
A HELL OF A LOT OF STRESS.

1:15:20.067 --> 1:15:21.600
- I KNOW,
BUT WHAT ARE THE ODDS

1:15:21.633 --> 1:15:24.067
THAT ALL FIVE OF THOSE PREGNANCY
TESTS WOULD BE WRONG?

1:15:24.067 --> 1:15:27.333
- I BOUGHT THEM ON CLEARANCE
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.

1:15:27.367 --> 1:15:30.633
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY HAD
AN EXPIRATION DATE.

1:15:30.667 --> 1:15:32.300
- [sighs]

1:15:32.333 --> 1:15:35.833
- I HAVE TO ADMIT, EVEN THOUGH
I WAS COMMITTED TO IT,

1:15:35.867 --> 1:15:39.167
I'M SO HAPPY I'M NOT ABOUT
TO BE SOMEONE'S MOTHER.

1:15:39.200 --> 1:15:40.600
- YOU DODGED A BULLET,
GIRL.

1:15:40.633 --> 1:15:42.067
- THE WHOLE VILLAGE
DODGED ONE.

1:15:42.067 --> 1:15:43.600
- WHAT HAPPENED
TO ALL THE SUPPORT?

1:15:43.633 --> 1:15:44.967
- THAT WAS THEN,
THIS IS NOW.

1:15:45.067 --> 1:15:46.500
- ALL RIGHT,
SO NO MORE SLIP-UPS.

1:15:46.533 --> 1:15:48.500
BUT IF YOU DO, JUST MAKE SURE
YOU WRAP IT UP.

1:15:48.533 --> 1:15:51.367

WITH SEX FOR A WHILE.

1:15:51.400 --> 1:15:53.100
OH.
- OH.

1:15:53.133 --> 1:15:55.633
- WHOA, DAMN.
HE COULD GET IT.

1:15:55.667 --> 1:15:57.133
- ALL OF IT.
- ALL OF IT.

1:16:01.433 --> 1:16:04.833
- OH. YOU KNOW WHAT?

1:16:04.867 --> 1:16:06.567
I'LL MEET YOU GUYS LATER.

1:16:06.600 --> 1:16:08.367
I NEED TO MAKE A STOP.

1:16:08.400 --> 1:16:10.367
- YOU SURE YOU GOT THIS?

1:16:10.400 --> 1:16:12.233
- YEAH, I GOT THIS.

1:16:15.200 --> 1:16:17.667
- SO, EVEN THOUGH,
YOU KNOW, MY HAMSTRING PULLS,

1:16:17.700 --> 1:16:19.567
AND I'M TELLING YOU,
IT HURT LIKE HELL, YOU KNOW,

1:16:19.600 --> 1:16:20.833
I HAD TO PUT THE BALL UP.

1:16:20.867 --> 1:16:21.833
WE ONLY HAD FIVE SECONDS
ON THE CLOCK.

1:16:21.867 --> 1:16:24.067

WE IN THE PLAYOFFS,

HOW MANY TIMES

1:16:27.833 --> 1:16:30.833
I'VE HEARD THAT STORY
ON A SATURDAY AFTERNOON

1:16:30.867 --> 1:16:32.900
AT THIS VERY CAFE
AT THIS VERY TABLE.

1:16:32.933 --> 1:16:36.967
EXCUSE ME FOR INTERRUPTING.
I'M SORRY, SHELLY.

1:16:37.067 --> 1:16:39.333
I KNOW NOW THAT YOU HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS,

1:16:39.367 --> 1:16:41.400
BUT I REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD
HEAR WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.

1:16:41.433 --> 1:16:42.667
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VAL?

1:16:42.700 --> 1:16:44.067
- WELL, I HAVE GREAT NEWS.

1:16:44.100 --> 1:16:46.100
I'M NOT PREGNANT.
[laughs]

1:16:46.133 --> 1:16:49.133
SO NOW YOU AND SHELLY WILL
NEVER HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT.

1:16:49.167 --> 1:16:50.900
THE ONLY THING YOU GUYS
DO HAVE TO DEAL WITH

1:16:50.933 --> 1:16:52.833
IS YOUR INFIDELITY.

1:16:52.867 --> 1:16:55.267
YES, IT HAPPENED
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO,

1:16:55.300 --> 1:16:57.467

I AM NOT HERE TO GLOAT

1:16:57.500 --> 1:16:59.733
NOR AM I HERE
TO START DRAMA.

1:16:59.767 --> 1:17:01.367
I JUST FEEL THAT
AS A WOMAN,

1:17:01.400 --> 1:17:02.367
IT IS ONLY FAIR
THAT YOU KNOW

1:17:02.400 --> 1:17:04.067
WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.

1:17:04.100 --> 1:17:05.233
- SEE? SEE? SHELLY,
I TOLD YOU SHE WAS CRAZY.

1:17:05.267 --> 1:17:06.633
COME ON, BABY,
LET'S GO.

1:17:06.667 --> 1:17:09.700
- NO, ACTUALLY,
I'D LIKE TO HEAR THIS.

1:17:09.733 --> 1:17:11.533
- QUINN, I'M JUST GONNA SAY
WHAT I CAME TO SAY

1:17:11.567 --> 1:17:13.833
AND LET YOU FINISH
YOUR LUNCH.

1:17:13.867 --> 1:17:17.533
THANK YOU FOR SHOWING ME
THAT MARRYING YOU

1:17:17.567 --> 1:17:19.733
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE BIGGEST
MISTAKE OF MY LIFE.

1:17:19.767 --> 1:17:23.100
I LOOK AT YOU NOW
AND I CAN'T UNDERSTAND

1:17:23.133 --> 1:17:25.067
WHY I WAS SO CAUGHT UP.

1:17:25.100 --> 1:17:29.433
YOU'RE PATHETIC, AND A SORRY
EXCUSE FOR A HUMAN BEING,

1:17:29.467 --> 1:17:31.067
LET ALONE A MAN.

1:17:31.100 --> 1:17:34.367
AND WHEN I SAY "MAN,"
I USE THE TERM VERY LOOSELY.

1:17:34.400 --> 1:17:37.700
- YOU SEE, THIS IS EXACTLY WHY
I KICKED YOU TO THE CURB.

1:17:37.733 --> 1:17:40.800
TOO MUCH DAMN DRAMA.
YOU KNOW WHAT Y--

1:17:40.833 --> 1:17:42.633
- GO TO HELL, QUINN.

1:17:46.833 --> 1:17:50.633
EXCUSE ME, THEY NEED A TOWEL
AT THAT TABLE OVER THERE.

1:17:50.667 --> 1:17:52.667
HE'S MADE QUITE A MESS.

MY THREE OLIVES.

BEAUTIFUL WOMEN, IT'S EASY.

WHOO!

1:18:16.400 --> 1:18:19.100
- I TOLD YOU.
EVERYONE SHOULD GET A WOODY.

1:18:19.133 --> 1:18:20.800
[laughter]

1:18:20.833 --> 1:18:23.200
- YOU KNOW, I'M FEELING
REALLY OBJECTIFIED RIGHT NOW.

1:18:23.233 --> 1:18:24.600
I'M GOING TO THE BATHROOM.

1:18:24.633 --> 1:18:28.433
- [clears throat]

1:18:28.467 --> 1:18:29.933
- SO I TAKE IT WOODY'S
COMING OVER TONIGHT?

1:18:29.967 --> 1:18:32.633
- I DON'T KNOW WHERE
WOODY'S COMING TONIGHT,

1:18:32.667 --> 1:18:34.100
BUT I'M GOING TO MALCOLM'S.

1:18:34.133 --> 1:18:35.200
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DO IT, GIRL,

1:18:35.233 --> 1:18:36.533
BUT YOU NEED TO
TEACH A CLASS.

1:18:36.567 --> 1:18:38.067
- I CAN'T GIVE AWAY
MY SECRETS.

1:18:38.067 --> 1:18:40.500
- OH, YES,
AND SPEAKING OF SECRETS,

1:18:40.533 --> 1:18:43.200
APRIL, IF YOU WANT TO LIE
TO YOUR HUSBAND, THAT'S ON YOU.

1:18:43.233 --> 1:18:44.767
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
DO IT TOO.

1:18:44.800 --> 1:18:46.333
NOW I FEEL LIKE
I'M CHEATING.

1:18:46.367 --> 1:18:49.067
NOT TO MENTION, I AM
THE WORST LIAR IN THE WORLD.

1:18:49.067 --> 1:18:51.433
- I KNOW.
I'M SORRY, I KNOW.

1:18:51.467 --> 1:18:53.833
BUT VAL, SERIOUSLY,
THANKS FOR COVERING FOR ME

1:18:53.867 --> 1:18:55.067
BECAUSE YOU TOTALLY
SAVED MY ASS.

1:18:55.067 --> 1:18:56.767
- MM-HMM. TWICE.

1:18:56.800 --> 1:18:58.467
- APRIL, LET ME
PREFACE THIS BY SAYING

1:18:58.500 --> 1:19:00.433
I'M YOUR FRIEND, OKAY?

1:19:00.467 --> 1:19:03.233
MAYOR HOWARD
IS A POWERFUL BLACK MAN

1:19:03.267 --> 1:19:05.067
RUNNING A BLACK CITY.

1:19:05.067 --> 1:19:07.433
HE IS NOT LEAVING HIS BLACK WIFE
FOR YOUR WHITE ASS,

1:19:07.467 --> 1:19:09.067
BUT I LOVE YOU.

1:19:09.100 --> 1:19:10.333
- I'M NOT TRYING TO GET HIM
TO LEAVE HIS WIFE,

1:19:10.367 --> 1:19:11.600
NOR AM I TRYING
TO LEAVE DARRYL.

1:19:11.633 --> 1:19:13.333
IT'S JUST A FLING.

1:19:13.367 --> 1:19:17.967
THE MAYOR DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING
MORE TO ME THAN THAT.

1:19:18.067 --> 1:19:20.267
I GOT IT UNDER CONTROL.

1:19:20.300 --> 1:19:22.333
- OH.

1:19:22.367 --> 1:19:24.267
*

1:19:24.300 --> 1:19:26.733
- IS IT ME OR IS THAT SHELLY
COMING OVER HERE?

1:19:26.767 --> 1:19:28.400
- OH, YES.
I INVITED HER.

1:19:28.433 --> 1:19:30.433
I MEAN, THE LEAST I CAN DO
IS BUY THE GIRL A DRINK,

1:19:30.467 --> 1:19:32.067
CONSIDERING I'M THE REASON
SHE CALLED OFF HER WEDDING.

1:19:32.100 --> 1:19:33.567
BESIDES, SHE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY FRIENDS.

1:19:33.600 --> 1:19:35.067
HI.
- HELLO.

1:19:35.067 --> 1:19:37.533
- CAN I JOIN YOU?
- ABSOLUTELY.

1:19:37.567 --> 1:19:39.133
OH, IT MUST HAVE BEEN
HARD TO LEAVE THE HOUSE.

1:19:39.167 --> 1:19:42.167
ARE YOU OKAY?
- 'CAUSE OF QUINN?

1:19:42.200 --> 1:19:45.367
OKAY, SO YOU GUYS SHOULD
KNOW THIS ABOUT ME.

1:19:45.400 --> 1:19:47.167
I GET ENGAGED A LOT.

1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:49.067
I ACTUALLY LEFT
THE LAST ONE AT THE ALTAR,

1:19:49.067 --> 1:19:50.733
SO QUINN KIND OF
GOT OFF EASY.

1:19:50.767 --> 1:19:52.067
- [laughs]

1:19:52.067 --> 1:19:53.300
- AND I WAS FEELING
SORRY FOR YOU.

1:19:53.333 --> 1:19:54.400
- WELL, IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL BETTER,

1:19:54.433 --> 1:19:55.867
MY DAD IS PISSED.

1:19:55.900 --> 1:19:57.067
HE SAYS I DON'T TAKE
ANYTHING SERIOUSLY

1:19:57.100 --> 1:19:58.533
AND THAT I HAVE A.D.D.

1:19:58.567 --> 1:20:01.400
OH, MY GOD. DID YOU GUYS
HEAR ABOUT THE MAYOR?

1:20:01.433 --> 1:20:04.333
[gasps] HE HAS SOME
WHITE CHICK ON THE SIDE,

1:20:04.367 --> 1:20:05.967
AND THEY JUST TWEETED
A PICTURE OF HER.

1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:09.367
IT'S LOADING.

1:20:09.400 --> 1:20:10.900
- CAN YOU TELL IT'S ME?

1:20:10.933 --> 1:20:13.367
- NO, NOT AT ALL,
BECAUSE IT'S NOT YOU.

1:20:13.400 --> 1:20:17.367
- THANK GOD.
- YEAH. THANK GOD.

1:20:17.400 --> 1:20:19.700
- OKAY, LADIES,
WE ALL HAVE A REASON

1:20:19.733 --> 1:20:21.800
TO WORSHIP
THE TEQUILA GODS TONIGHT.

1:20:21.833 --> 1:20:23.733
A TOAST.
- LET ME START.

1:20:23.767 --> 1:20:24.867
- OKAY.

1:20:24.900 --> 1:20:25.867
- VAL.
- MM-HMM.

1:20:25.900 --> 1:20:27.300
- I HAVE BEEN A JERK.

1:20:27.333 --> 1:20:30.033
I HAVE BEEN SELFISH TO
THE PEOPLE THAT I LOVE.

1:20:30.067 --> 1:20:34.133
- THAT'S THE ALCOHOL TALKING.
- NO, IT'S ALL ME.

1:20:34.167 --> 1:20:36.633
THANK YOU
FOR BEING A FRIEND

1:20:36.667 --> 1:20:39.367
WHILE I'M GOING THROUGH WHATEVER
IT IS I'M GOING THROUGH.

1:20:39.400 --> 1:20:41.533
- CAN WE DRINK NOW
BEFORE THE TEARS START?

1:20:41.567 --> 1:20:44.133
- WE MADE IT OUT OF THE FIRE,
LADIES.

1:20:44.167 --> 1:20:45.400
- MMM!

1:20:45.433 --> 1:20:47.867
- TO OLD FRIENDS,
NEW FRIENDS,

1:20:47.900 --> 1:20:49.633
AND GREAT ESCAPES.

1:20:49.667 --> 1:20:50.767
- HEAR, HEAR!

1:20:50.800 --> 1:20:51.900
[laughter]

1:20:51.933 --> 1:20:54.033
- HEAR, HEAR.
- AYE YI YI YI!

1:20:54.067 --> 1:20:56.233
- OKAY, SO CLEARLY I HAVE SOME
CATCHING UP TO DO WITH Y'ALL.

1:20:56.267 --> 1:20:57.267
- MMM!
- YES.

1:20:57.300 --> 1:20:58.900
- YEAH.
- LET'S DANCE.

1:20:58.933 --> 1:21:01.067
[laughter]

1:21:01.067 --> 1:21:02.333
- WHOO!

1:21:02.367 --> 1:21:04.133
- IT FEELS GOOD
TO BE DRAMA-FREE.

1:21:04.167 --> 1:21:05.433
- YEAH, WELL,
YOU KNOW WITH US,

1:21:05.467 --> 1:21:07.133
THAT WON'T LAST LONG.
[laughs]

1:21:07.167 --> 1:21:09.200
- SHOULD I BE SCARED
TO HANG OUT WITH YOU GUYS?

1:21:09.233 --> 1:21:10.767
- JUST FASTEN
YOUR SEATBELT, GIRL,

1:21:10.800 --> 1:21:13.067
'CAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO
FOR A RIDE.
