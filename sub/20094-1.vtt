00:35.418 --> 00:39.377
Just a little to the left,
a little more. Perfect.

00:40.090 --> 00:40.954
Daniel...

00:42.759 --> 00:44.818
this concert is not a good idea.

00:45.028 --> 00:47.929
Relax, Grandfather, everything will be fine.

00:48.732 --> 00:52.259
Come on, we're ready for Matt Marvelous'
sound check. You'll love him.

00:52.936 --> 00:54.801
Well, I don't know....

00:59.576 --> 01:01.373
Rock our world, Matt.

01:01.911 --> 01:03.811
Oh, okay.

01:08.485 --> 01:12.546
Matt Marvelous?
Well, I can barely hear him.

01:13.289 --> 01:14.620
Just wait.

01:23.366 --> 01:25.300
See? This guy rocks.

01:26.336 --> 01:28.099
Well, if you say so.

01:28.905 --> 01:31.965
If he didn't rock, he wouldn't be
a finalist in the contest.

01:41.251 --> 01:43.412
Oh, no. Daniel!

01:43.753 --> 01:45.152
What the....

02:07.544 --> 02:09.136
What's going on?

02:10.513 --> 02:11.878
Incredible.

02:21.291 --> 02:22.622
Let me go!

02:52.021 --> 02:54.148
The vampire legend is true.

05:32.482 --> 05:33.847
This is the life.

05:34.350 --> 05:35.612
Yeah, it sure is.

05:35.685 --> 05:38.848
Now that we've solved the mystery
of the sea serpent smugglers...

05:38.921 --> 05:41.549
our vacation should be smooth sailing.

05:50.299 --> 05:52.028
Great form, Daphne.

05:52.702 --> 05:54.226
Yeah, I'll say.

06:04.781 --> 06:07.511
Oh, boy, this should do for an appetizer.

06:30.339 --> 06:32.773
Hey, everybody. Come take a look.

06:34.110 --> 06:35.634
Sydney Harbour.

06:42.718 --> 06:45.278
Wow! We're finally in Australia.

06:46.122 --> 06:49.023
This is going to be the best vacation ever.

06:49.125 --> 06:50.319
Uh-huh!

06:59.268 --> 07:03.432
And no vacation would be complete
without the Mystery Machine.

07:24.660 --> 07:27.754
This guidebook says Sydney
has the best restaurants...

07:27.830 --> 07:29.730
in the entire southern hemisphere.

07:30.066 --> 07:34.730
Like, that's great, Velma, but Scoob
and I have got the food situation covered.

07:37.773 --> 07:39.001
Uh-huh.

07:39.242 --> 07:41.540
Doggie bags.

07:41.878 --> 07:44.608
That's right, Scoob. Doggie bags.

07:50.486 --> 07:53.182
Better eat now, guys.
We've got sightseeing to do...

07:53.256 --> 07:56.191
and pictures to take. Say "Vegemite."

07:56.792 --> 07:57.781
Vegemite.

08:08.404 --> 08:10.372
What an incredible view.

08:11.274 --> 08:14.209
You can see the whole continent up here.

08:14.610 --> 08:18.944
The Sydney Harbour Bridge
is the world's largest free-standing bridge.

08:21.651 --> 08:24.381
Like, that's a long way down, huh, Scoob?

08:29.992 --> 08:32.927
What's with the groovy ceiling
on that place?

08:33.261 --> 08:37.562
That's the Sydney Opera House.
It's the city's most famous landmark.

08:38.534 --> 08:41.434
It looks like an old-fashioned sailing ship.

08:41.871 --> 08:43.839
That's the idea, Shaggy.

08:45.174 --> 08:46.402
Oh, wow!

08:46.976 --> 08:48.341
What is it, Daphne?

08:48.411 --> 08:52.245
I finally found what I've been looking for.
Bondi beach.

09:08.497 --> 09:10.089
Lunch is served!

09:10.333 --> 09:12.301
Be right there, Freddie.

09:13.002 --> 09:15.835
Come on, gang!
Everything's going to get cold.

09:17.173 --> 09:18.731
Let's catch this wave.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.173
I'm hungry.

09:29.385 --> 09:30.875
What a sheila.

09:31.454 --> 09:33.115
I'll say, mate.

10:27.043 --> 10:31.104
Come on, Scoob, he's just a little guy.
No need to get all crabby.

10:42.224 --> 10:45.022
Come here, you guys. I've got a great idea.

10:45.895 --> 10:49.058
How do you guys feel
about exploring the outback?

10:49.231 --> 10:50.789
Outback?

10:50.900 --> 10:55.166
Sure, Australia's not all beach.
The outback's the wild, inland part.

10:55.604 --> 11:00.007
My guidebook says it makes up
almost 85 percent of the continent.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.340
Like, I know what the outback is...

11:02.411 --> 11:06.279
and I don't want to go "out back"
to look at dust and trees.

11:07.416 --> 11:10.852
Come on, Shaggy, I'm sure
there's more to see than that.

11:11.354 --> 11:14.812
And I've got 17 rolls of film
to capture it all.

11:15.291 --> 11:18.124
What if you could hear great music
while you were there?

11:18.194 --> 11:20.185
In the middle of nowhere?

11:20.396 --> 11:22.489
Not "nowhere." There, look.

11:25.234 --> 11:27.862
The Vampire Rock Music Festival!

11:28.504 --> 11:30.096
Vampire?

11:31.006 --> 11:33.702
That sounds like a lot of fun, Freddie!

11:34.276 --> 11:37.837
Vampire Rock is located right
in the middle of Australia.

11:38.047 --> 11:41.107
We can see a lot of the outback
on our way there.

11:41.484 --> 11:43.918
Scoob and I don't think it's a good idea...

11:43.986 --> 11:46.580
going to a place where vampires rock.

11:48.224 --> 11:49.919
That's asking for trouble.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.394
That's just the name of the place.

11:53.863 --> 11:56.491
And there's no such thing as vampires.

11:56.766 --> 11:58.631
And I'm sure a festival that big...

11:58.701 --> 12:01.761
will have every
concession stand imaginable.

12:02.304 --> 12:07.264
Licorice pizza, chocolate-covered
corn on the cob, tutti-frutti ice cream...

12:07.743 --> 12:10.473
not to mention some great local food.

12:11.847 --> 12:13.007
Ready.

12:13.916 --> 12:15.611
Real music lovers.

12:16.185 --> 12:19.518
Like, who ever heard
of Australian vampires, anyway?

12:23.692 --> 12:26.217
The rules of the contest are very simple.

12:26.295 --> 12:29.662
It's for unsigned bands,
no one can enter more than once.

12:29.865 --> 12:34.859
And as I've told you again and again,
each contestant only gets three minutes.

12:35.171 --> 12:38.402
But the Bad Omens' best song lasts five.

12:38.974 --> 12:43.104
Daniel and I have set the rules,
and rules are rules, Jasper.

12:43.879 --> 12:46.143
Can't you bend the rules a little?

12:46.382 --> 12:49.408
Especially for such an upstanding group
of young people?

12:51.854 --> 12:53.845
This better be important.

12:54.423 --> 12:56.482
I've got things to pierce.

12:56.826 --> 12:59.624
I'm trying to find a new shade of eyeliner.

13:02.298 --> 13:03.890
You were saying?

13:04.467 --> 13:08.335
Come on, Russell,
now that Matt Marvelous is gone...

13:08.404 --> 13:11.635
it's obvious the Bad Omens
are the best in the contest.

13:11.707 --> 13:14.676
Why not just declare us the winner now?

13:14.944 --> 13:16.878
-Yeah.
-Obviously.

13:17.947 --> 13:21.940
Jasper, get out of my face
or the Bad Omens won't perform at all.

13:22.751 --> 13:25.549
You're making a big mistake, Russell.

13:25.621 --> 13:27.714
I didn't have to come back here.

13:27.790 --> 13:30.759
Especially after what happened
to Wildwind last year.

13:33.028 --> 13:37.055
But I am back. And I intend
to have my group win this time.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.492
I'm warning you.

13:41.303 --> 13:43.498
Let's get out of here.

13:54.984 --> 13:58.147
-How much of that did you hear, partner?
-Enough.

13:58.354 --> 14:01.482
Jasper's never going to get over
what happened to Wildwind.

14:02.091 --> 14:05.185
I can't believe it's been almost a year
since they disappeared.

14:05.961 --> 14:09.863
From what you told me about last night,
it sounds like they're making a comeback.

14:10.132 --> 14:12.362
Maybe it's true what they say.

14:12.701 --> 14:15.499
About Wildwind being turned
into vampires?

14:15.704 --> 14:18.138
Come on, that's just a local myth.

14:18.641 --> 14:21.269
So what do you think happened
to Matt Marvelous then?

14:21.343 --> 14:23.868
You saw the vampires
with your own two eyes.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.312
I don't know what I saw, Russell.

14:26.415 --> 14:28.610
Well, the crew looked
all over Vampire Rock.

14:28.684 --> 14:31.414
There's no sign of Matt or your vampires.

14:32.755 --> 14:35.053
Maybe my grandfather was right.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.282
Maybe we should postpone the festival.

14:37.359 --> 14:41.523
No way. We've both worked too hard
to quit now, Daniel.

14:42.431 --> 14:45.127
You're right. And the show must go on.

14:45.601 --> 14:49.162
This kidnapping makes me nervous,
Russell. Very nervous.

14:55.811 --> 14:57.836
There are the Scooby Snacks!

15:02.184 --> 15:04.948
Aren't you guys ever going to stop
playing that game?

15:05.020 --> 15:08.922
Like I said before, nothing to look at
but dust and trees.

15:10.859 --> 15:14.317
You'd be surprised, Shaggy,
the outback is full of life.

15:15.965 --> 15:18.991
Oh, boy, I'll believe it when I see it.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.946
Just a few more miles, I mean kilometers.

17:15.050 --> 17:17.143
Anyway, we're almost there.

17:22.357 --> 17:26.349
It's amazing that they're having
a music festival way out here.

17:29.331 --> 17:31.561
There it is, Vampire Rock.

17:32.935 --> 17:35.904
-Wow!
-It's spectacular.

17:36.004 --> 17:38.996
Man, we really are
in the middle of nowhere.

17:39.508 --> 17:44.241
It says the locals call it Vampire Rock
because they believe the Yowie Yahoo...

17:44.313 --> 17:46.338
Iives in the rock's caves.

17:46.782 --> 17:48.545
The Yowie Yahoo?

17:49.651 --> 17:51.881
An ancient Australian vampire.

17:53.021 --> 17:56.889
We were wrong, Scoob.
There are Australian vampires.

18:00.329 --> 18:03.457
Next time I agree to go to a place
named after a vampire...

18:03.532 --> 18:05.932
I need you to do me a favor, Scoob.

18:06.001 --> 18:07.025
What?

18:07.102 --> 18:09.002
Like, talk me out of it.

18:14.042 --> 18:16.237
Are we in the right place, Freddie?

18:16.311 --> 18:18.074
Uh-huh. This is it.

18:37.032 --> 18:38.795
What is it, Scoob?

18:46.141 --> 18:49.668
Like, very funny, Scoob.
You almost had me going there.

19:02.624 --> 19:04.489
Like, what is it now?

19:12.668 --> 19:15.034
It's the Yowie Yahoo!

19:15.103 --> 19:16.263
Where?

19:19.041 --> 19:22.033
Come on, you two.
We don't have time for games.

19:22.144 --> 19:26.308
It's no game. Scoob and I saw
the Yowie Yahoo right over there.

19:28.483 --> 19:32.476
I already told you guys,
there's no such thing as a vampire.

19:32.754 --> 19:35.917
Then what's making all that noise?

19:36.325 --> 19:38.850
Whatever it is, it's moving closer.

19:43.131 --> 19:45.361
Well, do something, Freddie.

19:52.474 --> 19:54.465
It's the vampire!

20:24.873 --> 20:26.738
Do you guys hear that?

20:26.808 --> 20:30.107
Come on, gang, there must be
somebody else around here.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.243
This way.

20:47.529 --> 20:49.497
Hey, the Hex Girls!

20:50.032 --> 20:52.933
I knew those tunes sounded familiar.

20:56.705 --> 20:58.036
It is you.

20:58.807 --> 21:00.934
Boy, are we glad to see you.

21:01.076 --> 21:02.976
What are you doing here?

21:03.045 --> 21:05.070
Well, we were on vacation.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.907
And we thought
we'd check out the festival.

21:07.983 --> 21:10.281
Cool. We're opening the festival.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.547
How long have you guys been here?

21:12.621 --> 21:14.350
A couple of days. Why?

21:14.690 --> 21:17.853
Have you seen anything strange
since you arrived?

21:17.993 --> 21:19.017
Strange?

21:19.094 --> 21:20.561
Like what?

21:20.629 --> 21:25.566
Like what? How about big,
creepy and scary....

21:27.135 --> 21:29.433
I was wondering why the music stopped.

21:29.504 --> 21:31.597
We came to make sure you were all right.

21:31.673 --> 21:33.072
Of course we're all right.

21:33.141 --> 21:34.438
Why wouldn't we be?

21:34.509 --> 21:35.533
Just checking.

21:35.610 --> 21:37.874
Are you going to introduce us
to your friends?

21:37.946 --> 21:41.404
Yeah. These are our friends from America:

21:41.483 --> 21:46.216
-Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy--
-And Scooby-Doo.

21:46.722 --> 21:47.746
G'day.

21:47.823 --> 21:50.053
Welcome. Sorry we interrupted.

21:50.125 --> 21:53.356
We're trying to clear up some trouble
before the festival starts.

21:53.428 --> 21:55.020
What's going on?

21:55.163 --> 21:58.894
The finalists in our unsigned-band
contest are disappearing.

21:59.034 --> 22:00.331
Well, that's not good.

22:00.402 --> 22:04.133
Did you say, "disappeared"?

22:05.707 --> 22:08.198
The groups are bailing
as quickly as they arrive.

22:08.276 --> 22:10.870
They hear Matt Marvelous
has been kidnapped and go...

22:10.946 --> 22:12.538
from "g'day" to "good-bye."

22:12.614 --> 22:14.275
Kidnapped? By who?

22:14.349 --> 22:18.342
Maybe by a big, creepy and scary....

22:18.553 --> 22:19.781
Vampire.

22:21.523 --> 22:24.720
Daniel, I warned you
terrible things would happen.

22:31.900 --> 22:34.300
Who was that spooky old man?

22:34.636 --> 22:37.332
That was my grandfather,
Malcolm llliwara.

22:37.472 --> 22:41.135
I meant spooky in a good way.

22:43.545 --> 22:46.446
You'll have to forgive him. He's very upset.

22:46.815 --> 22:50.342
I understand.
I'm pretty upset myself right now.

22:50.852 --> 22:54.151
What did your grandfather mean
by "terrible things"?

22:54.990 --> 22:56.116
The Yowie Yahoo.

22:56.291 --> 23:00.091
You mean the vampire who lives in there?

23:00.295 --> 23:02.786
Yeah. Him and his vampire minions.

23:03.532 --> 23:05.864
Minions? You mean he has help?

23:05.934 --> 23:09.495
Well, so they say.
But there's no such thing as vampires.

23:09.638 --> 23:12.129
Don't you mean rock star vampires?

23:12.641 --> 23:14.233
That's Wildwind.

23:14.709 --> 23:18.668
I've seen groups like Wildwind
in my parent's record collection.

23:19.181 --> 23:21.945
Yeah. Check out
the makeup and costumes.

23:23.718 --> 23:26.585
This poster must be from a long time ago.

23:26.888 --> 23:30.517
Nope. The members of Wildwind are
only a couple of years older than you.

23:30.592 --> 23:32.924
Wildwind wanted to bring glam rock back.

23:32.994 --> 23:36.828
They did an amazing song
at last year's unsigned-band contest.

23:36.898 --> 23:40.061
Dark Skull played guitar,
Stormy Weathers played bass...

23:40.135 --> 23:42.069
and Lightning Strikes was on drums.

23:42.804 --> 23:45.034
Wow! So you saw them perform?

23:45.874 --> 23:49.207
I sure did.
They deserved better than third place.

23:49.478 --> 23:50.968
What happened to them?

23:51.113 --> 23:55.174
After they lost the contest,
they went up to Vampire Rock to camp.

23:55.684 --> 23:58.084
They were never heard from again.

24:00.689 --> 24:02.554
They just disappeared?

24:03.125 --> 24:06.526
The locals believe the Yowie Yahoo
turned them into vampires.

24:06.595 --> 24:08.062
I'm with the locals.

24:08.130 --> 24:10.860
That would explain
the big, creepy, and scary....

24:10.932 --> 24:13.457
All right, Shaggy, we get your point.

24:13.835 --> 24:17.669
There's no such thing as vampires.
You said it yourself, Daniel.

24:17.739 --> 24:21.106
Well, maybe not.
But Daniel says he saw Matt Marvelous...

24:21.176 --> 24:24.976
get kidnapped by three vampires
who looked like Wildwind.

24:27.182 --> 24:29.810
I never actually said, "Vampires."

24:30.318 --> 24:32.081
Do you have a better explanation?

24:32.154 --> 24:35.851
Whoever or whatever they were,
they were pretty convincing.

24:36.158 --> 24:38.422
Now I don't know what to think.

24:38.493 --> 24:40.825
When did this all start, Daniel?

24:41.196 --> 24:44.688
Ever since I was a boy, my grandfather
told me the Yowie Yahoo...

24:44.766 --> 24:47.735
Iived in Vampire Rock.
I never believed him.

24:47.802 --> 24:49.360
But in the past few months...

24:49.437 --> 24:52.929
there have been a lot of strange lights
and sounds coming from up there.

24:53.475 --> 24:56.376
I'd love to find out what's really going on.

24:56.811 --> 25:00.645
Well, gang, it looks like we have
another mystery on our hands.

25:05.854 --> 25:07.185
A mystery?

25:07.255 --> 25:09.723
We'll need to investigate this
from the inside.

25:09.791 --> 25:13.693
And the best way to do that
is to go undercover as a rock band.

25:14.229 --> 25:18.188
If we're lucky, the Wildwind vampires
will try to kidnap us next.

25:19.467 --> 25:21.401
I don't want to be that lucky.

25:21.469 --> 25:23.164
That's a great idea, Freddie.

25:23.238 --> 25:25.331
I'm not so sure about this.

25:25.840 --> 25:27.865
They may be our only hope.

25:28.577 --> 25:30.977
I guess it could work.
Especially if it keeps...

25:31.046 --> 25:34.106
my pick to win the contest
from getting kidnapped.

25:34.182 --> 25:35.410
And who's that?

25:35.483 --> 25:38.281
Two Skinny Dudes.
They haven't shown up yet.

25:38.353 --> 25:43.222
I know you've never seen them perform,
but trust me, they're the real deal.

25:43.725 --> 25:45.454
So what do you say?

25:45.594 --> 25:48.893
Well, okay. But don't say I didn't warn you.

25:49.698 --> 25:52.599
Scoob and I wouldn't mind
sitting this one out.

25:53.868 --> 25:56.837
Maybe the group should be a trio.

25:59.341 --> 26:01.172
Come on, you chickens.

26:01.243 --> 26:04.076
Luna, Dusk and I will help you
look the part.

26:04.145 --> 26:06.739
Yeah, there's a wardrobe room backstage.

26:06.815 --> 26:08.783
This is going to be fun.

26:09.217 --> 26:13.551
I knew coming to a place
called Vampire Rock was a bad idea.

26:42.017 --> 26:44.349
How do rock stars walk in these?

26:45.053 --> 26:46.577
Pretend they're high heels.

26:46.655 --> 26:48.850
I'm not good at those either.

27:02.871 --> 27:07.069
I don't know how well we'll play,
but at least we look the part.

27:07.442 --> 27:09.501
I hope we don't have to play at all.

27:09.577 --> 27:11.670
I thought you loved to sing, Velma.

27:11.746 --> 27:15.011
Not in front of so many people.
I get stage fright.

27:15.517 --> 27:17.849
Well, I get vampire fright.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.786
Hey, look at this.

27:26.394 --> 27:27.622
Makeup?

27:27.862 --> 27:31.559
Stage makeup actually.
So the audience can see you better.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.332
Matt Marvelous was a musician.

27:34.402 --> 27:38.463
Even so, I doubt he'd wear this color.
It's glowing white.

27:39.007 --> 27:43.603
And look at this, it's a footprint.
From a hiking boot to be exact.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.471
Wow, that's strange.

27:46.548 --> 27:47.572
How so?

27:47.649 --> 27:51.415
The print is sticky like glue.
But it's not glue exactly.

27:52.120 --> 27:54.088
I don't know what it is.

27:57.959 --> 28:00.052
You're the new competition?

28:00.829 --> 28:04.356
Yeah, we're taking Matt Marvelous'
place in the contest.

28:08.236 --> 28:10.363
You must be Jasper Ridgeway.

28:10.472 --> 28:12.702
And you must be the Bad Omens.

28:13.241 --> 28:16.108
Russell warned, I mean, told us about you.

28:17.078 --> 28:19.774
Whoever heard of band with a dog in it?

28:32.327 --> 28:35.194
Why don't you amateurs take a break?

28:35.930 --> 28:38.899
Yeah, it's time for a real band to play.

28:40.902 --> 28:44.599
Let's go, gang, we need to set up camp
for the night anyway.

28:44.839 --> 28:48.400
Camping? How primitive.
I choose to travel...

28:48.543 --> 28:51.535
in a fully furnished, air-conditioned trailer.

28:51.613 --> 28:55.606
Russell told us about another band
you used to manage, Wildwind.

28:57.085 --> 29:00.486
Yes, they were true superstars.

29:01.022 --> 29:02.990
I had such high hopes for them.

29:03.558 --> 29:06.220
Until that fateful night last year.

29:07.028 --> 29:10.828
I don't like to talk to about it.
It's just too upsetting.

29:12.934 --> 29:16.734
Well, back to the trailer.
I can't take this heat any longer.

29:18.273 --> 29:19.865
Enjoy your rehearsal.

29:23.611 --> 29:25.772
Stupid golf cart!

29:30.118 --> 29:32.086
Nice to meet you, too.

29:33.788 --> 29:37.519
Let's get out of these costumes
and start looking for clues.

29:41.196 --> 29:43.926
And get you into more comfortable shoes.

29:45.967 --> 29:49.266
I think we may have just met
our so-called vampires.

29:50.305 --> 29:51.863
The Bad Omens?

29:52.140 --> 29:53.368
Exactly.

29:53.641 --> 29:58.305
Jasper Ridgeway seems the kind of guy
who'd do anything to have his band win.

29:58.613 --> 30:01.013
You think he put them up to it?

30:07.755 --> 30:12.021
The makeup the Bad Omens were wearing
looks like the stage makeup I found.

30:12.494 --> 30:16.897
Maybe we should talk to Daniel
and Russell and find out more about them.

30:17.131 --> 30:20.726
I bet Jasper's trailer could tell us
a thing or two.

30:21.102 --> 30:23.093
Yeah, let's check it out.

30:23.705 --> 30:26.538
Shaggy and Scooby, you see
what you can dig up around here.

30:27.442 --> 30:31.401
We'll leave no snow cone,
I mean, stone unturned.

30:38.953 --> 30:42.548
Jasper wasn't kidding when he said
he travels in style.

30:43.091 --> 30:44.786
We've got to get a look inside.

30:44.993 --> 30:46.517
How are we going to do that?

30:46.594 --> 30:49.563
We need to lure him out.
And I've got a plan.

30:49.831 --> 30:50.490
Fred?

30:50.565 --> 30:52.396
Wait, this is brilliant.

30:52.467 --> 30:54.958
I'm going to go off
into those bushes over there...

30:55.036 --> 30:57.231
and imitate the call
of the wild kookaburra.

30:57.305 --> 30:58.363
But, Fred....

30:58.439 --> 31:00.270
Hold on, Velma, I'm on a roll.

31:00.341 --> 31:03.037
Now, Daphne, I want you
to disguise yourself...

31:03.111 --> 31:05.443
as an aboriginal medicine woman and--

31:05.513 --> 31:07.447
-Fred!
-What?

31:07.982 --> 31:10.576
Or, we could just use the front door.

31:11.452 --> 31:12.441
Or that.

31:14.822 --> 31:16.153
All clear.

31:19.360 --> 31:21.055
This is better than a museum.

31:21.529 --> 31:23.429
Whoa. Totally retro.

31:24.599 --> 31:26.260
You're telling me.

31:26.401 --> 31:29.666
Look, it's a waterbed.

31:30.705 --> 31:33.538
Seems like Jasper can't let go of the past.

31:36.277 --> 31:38.142
In more ways than one.

31:40.214 --> 31:44.446
Come on, girls, we've got to work fast.
Jasper could show up at any minute.

31:44.519 --> 31:46.214
There's so much stuff in here...

31:46.287 --> 31:49.450
it's going to be hard to tell the clues
from the collectibles.

31:49.924 --> 31:54.088
Jinkies! I think I already found one.

31:55.296 --> 31:56.957
Great work, Velma.

31:57.165 --> 31:59.258
This looks exactly like the costume...

31:59.334 --> 32:01.996
Dark Skull of Wildwind wore
in that poster.

32:03.338 --> 32:07.672
The costumes for Lightning Strikes
and Stormy Weathers are in here, too.

32:07.875 --> 32:12.107
So Jasper Ridgeway has reproductions
of all the Wildwind costumes.

32:12.780 --> 32:14.179
Interesting.

32:20.488 --> 32:23.286
They call this Australian bread "damper."

32:23.491 --> 32:26.949
But it's sure not putting
a damper on my appetite.

32:42.644 --> 32:44.771
What's next, old buddy?

32:48.249 --> 32:49.511
Vampires.

32:50.218 --> 32:53.346
Now I'm not hungry at all!

35:06.921 --> 35:08.149
What the....

35:33.414 --> 35:34.938
What is that?

36:04.879 --> 36:06.870
Gosh, what happened here?

36:08.149 --> 36:10.242
What's with all this smoke?

36:10.384 --> 36:12.011
It burns my eyes.

36:12.787 --> 36:15.881
It smells so sweet, like cotton candy.

36:16.924 --> 36:18.016
Cotton candy?

36:18.726 --> 36:20.523
Shaggy and Scooby?

36:21.128 --> 36:22.959
What happened to the Bad Omens?

36:23.531 --> 36:26.159
The Yowie Yahoo and
the Wildwind vampires...

36:26.234 --> 36:28.429
showed up and band-napped them.

36:28.536 --> 36:30.436
Scoob and I thought we were next.

36:33.641 --> 36:36.838
There goes our prime suspects.

36:37.945 --> 36:41.005
You actually saw
the Wildwind vampires, Shaggy?

36:41.649 --> 36:42.946
We both did.

36:44.852 --> 36:46.342
What did they look like?

36:49.724 --> 36:54.127
Exactly like the guys on that poster,
only scarier.

36:54.328 --> 36:57.320
And they had those creepy red eyes.

36:57.465 --> 36:58.796
Yeah, red.

36:59.600 --> 37:02.296
Well, whoever it was,
they kidnapped the Bad Omens.

37:03.838 --> 37:06.363
Kidnapped? Not again.

37:06.874 --> 37:10.503
The Bad Omens can't be kidnapped.
They need to win the contest.

37:10.912 --> 37:13.107
It's a good thing you weren't here.

37:13.581 --> 37:16.345
Those vampires would have flown off
with you, too.

37:17.118 --> 37:20.645
I wish they had.
Now I'll be plagued by guilt.

37:20.821 --> 37:24.313
I should have stayed with them
instead of going back to my trailer.

37:25.326 --> 37:27.521
Trailer....

37:28.896 --> 37:30.295
What happened here?

37:30.364 --> 37:34.027
My band is gone!
What are we going to do?

37:34.602 --> 37:36.160
There's strength in numbers.

37:36.237 --> 37:39.695
Let's get the Hex Girls and Russell,
and then camp in one group.

37:40.274 --> 37:43.937
Russell already went home,
along with all the other festival staff.

37:44.145 --> 37:46.375
I wish I could say the same thing.

37:47.648 --> 37:50.811
And if the vampires come back
when we're sleeping, what then?

37:51.752 --> 37:53.982
We can take turns standing watch.

37:54.055 --> 37:56.546
And you guys have the first tour of duty...

38:02.263 --> 38:03.730
which starts now.

38:04.231 --> 38:06.722
Would you each do it for a Scooby Snack?

38:07.335 --> 38:09.895
Or maybe two Scooby Snacks?

38:13.374 --> 38:17.208
There might be room in my tummy
for a Scooby Snack or two.

38:17.278 --> 38:19.109
How about you, Scoob?

38:19.180 --> 38:21.171
Yeah, Scooby Snack!

38:23.718 --> 38:28.280
Everyone get some rest, because
you're being watched over by the best.

38:53.814 --> 38:55.475
Not again!

38:58.352 --> 38:59.876
It's the vampires!

39:05.292 --> 39:06.316
Run!

39:14.068 --> 39:16.969
The vampires are in a motorcycle gang?

39:32.053 --> 39:35.250
You're not vampires. Who are you?

39:35.823 --> 39:37.313
Two Skinny Dudes.

39:39.160 --> 39:40.559
Like, me, too.

39:41.862 --> 39:46.993
We're the band Two Skinny Dudes.
I'm Barry and this is my brother Harry.

39:47.635 --> 39:50.195
Finally. I've heard so much
about you from Russell.

39:50.304 --> 39:51.999
Glad you made it here all right.

39:52.073 --> 39:53.563
Why wouldn't we?

39:53.741 --> 39:55.971
Some of the other bands
have been kidnapped.

39:56.210 --> 39:57.837
By vampires.

40:01.348 --> 40:04.840
If you weren't kidnapped,
where have you been?

40:06.854 --> 40:08.583
Exploring Vampire Rock.

40:09.090 --> 40:11.558
We liked it so much,
we decided to camp up there.

40:11.859 --> 40:14.384
But we didn't see a single vampire.

40:15.396 --> 40:17.921
Matt Marvelous and
the Bad Omens sure did.

40:18.299 --> 40:21.757
The other finalists got so scared
they all drove back to Sydney.

40:23.237 --> 40:26.035
That means we're the only ones left?

40:26.107 --> 40:28.098
Does this mean we win the contest?

40:28.409 --> 40:31.378
Not quite. We had a last minute entry.

40:43.457 --> 40:45.482
What do you think?

40:46.694 --> 40:48.423
Keep working on it.

40:51.799 --> 40:54.700
What's all the racket?
Did you find my band?

40:55.436 --> 40:57.301
No, but we found another one.

40:57.638 --> 41:00.004
Jasper, meet Two Skinny Dudes.

41:00.074 --> 41:02.440
Two Skinny Dudes.

41:05.179 --> 41:07.409
Russell tells me you're the next big thing.

41:09.483 --> 41:11.212
You boys have a manager?

41:13.287 --> 41:14.515
No.

41:14.588 --> 41:17.250
Groovy.

41:17.892 --> 41:20.383
Why don't you come into my trailer...

41:21.395 --> 41:24.728
and let me tell you what I can do
for your careers.

41:25.666 --> 41:28.464
Jeepers. He works fast.

41:29.603 --> 41:33.937
Jasper seemed to forget about
the Bad Omens pretty quickly.

41:36.677 --> 41:37.974
We should get going.

41:38.045 --> 41:40.343
We've still got two missing bands
out there...

41:40.414 --> 41:42.780
and the concert starts tonight at 6:00.

41:42.850 --> 41:44.579
What's with all the noise?

41:45.853 --> 41:48.321
How are we supposed to rest
for the show tonight?

41:48.656 --> 41:50.988
In other words, would you mind?

41:53.394 --> 41:54.656
Divas.

42:03.470 --> 42:06.166
I pulled up more research on vampires.

42:06.507 --> 42:08.566
Anything on how to avoid them?

42:08.876 --> 42:12.243
You can ask my grandfather.
He knows all about the local legends.

42:12.513 --> 42:14.606
Especially the Yowie Yahoo.

42:15.716 --> 42:16.740
Let's see.

42:16.817 --> 42:18.284
"Vampires hate sunlight.

42:18.352 --> 42:20.217
"They can't cross running water."

42:20.287 --> 42:24.485
And get this: "The more people a vampire
puts under his control...

42:24.825 --> 42:27.419
"the greater his power becomes."

42:28.128 --> 42:32.292
That would explain why the Yowie Yahoo
is having Wildwind kidnap people.

42:33.667 --> 42:36.192
That is, if you believe he's real.

42:37.304 --> 42:41.832
It also says, "Vampires don't appear
on film when their pictures are taken."

42:42.743 --> 42:44.677
Maybe they're just camera shy.

42:45.512 --> 42:48.242
Here we are, Fred. Up there.
Ahead on the left.

42:58.692 --> 43:01.354
Grandfather, these are
some friends of mine.

43:02.029 --> 43:05.590
Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby.

43:06.300 --> 43:08.427
Yes, I saw you at the festival.

43:08.702 --> 43:10.727
They're here to help with our problem.

43:11.038 --> 43:13.302
What's the deal with the smoke signals?

43:13.907 --> 43:16.432
There's a tribal council meeting
later today.

43:16.510 --> 43:18.205
I'm letting the others know.

43:18.545 --> 43:20.775
You could just use the phone, Grandfather.

43:21.181 --> 43:24.878
We've always used smoke signals
to announce tribal council meetings.

43:25.653 --> 43:28.952
The smoke smells really good.
What are you burning?

43:29.023 --> 43:33.187
The wood is from the red gum tree.
We use its flowers to make honey.

43:33.460 --> 43:36.258
That red gum over there is in full bloom.

44:02.256 --> 44:05.350
It is good of all of you
to take me to the council meeting.

44:05.993 --> 44:08.018
Daniel was telling us that you know...

44:08.095 --> 44:11.087
all about the Yowie Yahoo legend,
Mr. Illiwara.

44:11.732 --> 44:13.222
Please, call me Malcolm.

44:13.701 --> 44:17.364
I can tell you many things
about the Yowie Yahoo, young lady.

44:17.738 --> 44:20.172
But, you may not like what you hear.

44:20.507 --> 44:22.771
Can you tell us what happened
to Wildwind?

44:23.010 --> 44:26.446
Wildwind foolishly went up
to Vampire Rock after dark.

44:26.980 --> 44:29.608
They were easy prey for the Yowie Yahoo.

44:29.683 --> 44:33.210
Just like all the people attending
the festival will be.

44:33.687 --> 44:37.282
So what can we do to keep him and
his rock-star pals away?

44:38.192 --> 44:42.925
According to legend, the only thing
that can destroy a vampire is sunlight.

44:43.731 --> 44:46.063
According to legends, Grandfather.

44:46.467 --> 44:49.436
It's believed they also fear the dingo.

44:49.970 --> 44:53.906
They could be your distant cousins,
Scoob. See if they'll help us out.

45:02.850 --> 45:04.408
Don't bother me, Scoob!

45:34.014 --> 45:37.848
Looks like vampires aren't
the only monsters around here.

45:37.951 --> 45:41.512
That crocodile almost had
his very own Scooby Snack.

45:42.055 --> 45:43.522
Thank goodness he didn't.

45:43.590 --> 45:45.820
I scheduled your group to perform tonight.

45:46.660 --> 45:47.854
Perform?

45:47.928 --> 45:49.555
Right after the Hex Girls.

45:49.963 --> 45:51.897
We hope you'll come, Malcolm.

45:51.965 --> 45:52.954
I can't.

45:53.167 --> 45:56.193
Not when I believe the festival
shouldn't take place at all.

45:56.670 --> 45:59.867
I know how you feel, Grandfather.
But I've got a show to do.

46:00.307 --> 46:02.070
Smoke!

46:02.576 --> 46:04.976
They're answering
one of my smoke signals.

46:05.112 --> 46:07.603
It's my friend on the other side
of Vampire Rock.

46:08.315 --> 46:09.839
We're almost there.

46:10.150 --> 46:12.482
Can you show me how to do that?

46:12.719 --> 46:17.315
If the vampires come back, I want
to send an S.O.S. "Save our Shaggy."

46:21.895 --> 46:23.260
One, two, three, four!

46:56.296 --> 46:59.663
-Jinkies!
-There really is a Yowie Yahoo.

47:00.434 --> 47:02.766
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

47:14.815 --> 47:16.180
No. Not now!

47:16.383 --> 47:18.908
You're ruining our encore.

47:25.692 --> 47:27.592
The Hex Girls are in trouble!

47:50.217 --> 47:51.206
Now what?

47:51.285 --> 47:53.879
They must be heading to Vampire Rock.

47:54.254 --> 47:56.245
We need to go after them.

47:56.790 --> 47:58.121
Great idea, Fred!

47:58.191 --> 48:00.989
While you're gone, Scoob and l
will practice our number.

48:15.075 --> 48:17.043
Weren't the Hex Girls terrific?

48:17.311 --> 48:20.178
We'll be taking a short break.
See you real soon.

48:21.615 --> 48:23.276
What are we going to do?

48:23.617 --> 48:26.609
Maybe my grandfather was right.
Where's Russell?

48:26.787 --> 48:29.221
We've got to cancel the rest of the show.

48:29.289 --> 48:30.517
Not yet.

48:30.591 --> 48:33.151
I've got a plan that will end this
once and for all.

48:33.961 --> 48:35.326
Now here's what we do.

48:44.638 --> 48:47.732
I knew Vampire Rock was big,
but not this big.

48:48.675 --> 48:52.236
It's going to be harder finding
the Hex Girls than we thought.

48:56.550 --> 48:57.812
We need to split up.

48:58.418 --> 49:00.545
Daphne, Velma, and I will head this way.

49:00.854 --> 49:03.948
Shaggy and Scooby,
you circle around in the other direction.

49:06.193 --> 49:08.855
Vacation has really brought us
closer together.

49:09.262 --> 49:11.696
It's a shame to split up now.

49:19.539 --> 49:23.737
Vampire Rock seems to be just that.
Solid rock.

49:24.544 --> 49:27.104
There's got to be a way in somehow.

49:32.486 --> 49:34.215
You were saying?

49:34.788 --> 49:38.224
We've walked all the way
around this creepy rock.

49:41.895 --> 49:43.260
What was that?

49:44.197 --> 49:45.994
Quit kidding around, Scoob.

49:48.602 --> 49:50.433
Dingo dogs!

49:55.208 --> 49:58.041
Secret passages always lead somewhere.

49:59.579 --> 50:03.174
Right now, we should be experiencing
total cave darkness.

50:03.884 --> 50:06.444
But we're not, so....

50:06.520 --> 50:09.318
There must be light coming
from inside the cave.

50:10.590 --> 50:12.251
Over there!

50:18.765 --> 50:22.326
Wow! I was expecting a Vampire's lair
to be more....

50:22.402 --> 50:24.529
I don't know, spooky.

50:25.539 --> 50:27.837
It's like an underground warehouse.

50:29.643 --> 50:31.975
These lanterns didn't light themselves.

50:32.379 --> 50:33.368
Right, Velma.

50:33.447 --> 50:36.644
They're only big enough
to hold a few hours worth of oil.

50:37.084 --> 50:40.451
That means, someone had to be here
a little while ago.

50:42.022 --> 50:45.788
They also used the equipment.
This fan is still warm.

50:46.326 --> 50:47.953
And so is this light.

50:48.395 --> 50:50.590
This equipment's been used all right.

50:50.931 --> 50:52.694
The question is why?

50:53.200 --> 50:54.189
And where?

50:54.267 --> 50:55.632
And by who?

51:17.491 --> 51:18.890
No coffins?

51:23.363 --> 51:25.661
Fred! Velma!

51:48.121 --> 51:50.749
We can't run. We can't climb.

51:51.191 --> 51:53.159
How are we going to get out of here?

52:07.541 --> 52:10.237
Good try, buddy, but we need a miracle.

53:11.805 --> 53:13.864
Like I said, a miracle.

53:14.341 --> 53:17.367
Or Daphne doing a dive off a cliff.

53:17.978 --> 53:20.674
-That's a 10!
-Thanks, guys.

53:23.049 --> 53:24.448
What a mess.

53:24.918 --> 53:26.818
You think Daphne's in here?

53:26.887 --> 53:28.821
If she is, she's not alone.

53:30.023 --> 53:32.491
I'm going to check down here.

53:33.026 --> 53:35.460
Daphne!

53:37.530 --> 53:38.656
My glasses.

53:41.434 --> 53:42.833
I lost my glasses.

53:44.804 --> 53:46.169
Thanks, Freddie.

53:47.274 --> 53:48.866
I was getting worried.

53:52.279 --> 53:54.042
Now I am worried.

54:02.722 --> 54:04.747
Velma! Did you find Daphne?

54:05.325 --> 54:07.020
Wherever Daphne is...

54:08.395 --> 54:10.329
she's a lot safer than we are.

54:15.969 --> 54:17.027
Run!

54:22.242 --> 54:25.473
And he was hanging upside down.
Then he took off after me.

54:26.079 --> 54:28.912
Come on,
we've got to find Fred and Velma.

54:38.525 --> 54:40.652
Or they could find us.

54:41.695 --> 54:43.595
Fred! Velma! You're all right.

54:44.798 --> 54:47.130
Not if we don't get out of here.

54:54.274 --> 54:58.005
I need a vacation from this vacation.

55:01.214 --> 55:03.239
It's the Yowie Yahoo!

55:17.263 --> 55:19.731
Come on! Everyone over the bridge!

55:46.393 --> 55:50.523
If there was ever a time
not to be calm, this is it!

56:29.702 --> 56:31.966
Scooby! Get back here!

56:55.929 --> 56:59.160
The Yowie Yahoo sure is full of hot air.

56:59.799 --> 57:01.699
Freddie, are you okay?

57:01.901 --> 57:04.631
Now I know how my socks feel
in the dryer.

57:11.010 --> 57:13.444
I feel the same way, Scooby.

57:21.788 --> 57:23.779
It's the dingo dogs!

57:30.563 --> 57:32.087
They're getting away!

57:33.199 --> 57:36.066
They've got to get inside
before the sun comes out.

57:39.239 --> 57:42.697
Scoob, tell your cousins,
"Don't leave us here with the...."

57:43.042 --> 57:44.441
Yowie Yahoo!

57:47.780 --> 57:49.543
Hang on tight, guys.

57:50.150 --> 57:52.448
Fred, do we have a choice?

57:54.621 --> 57:56.418
The sun is almost up.

57:58.892 --> 58:02.157
The Yowie Yahoo has to get inside
Vampire Rock, too.

58:03.062 --> 58:05.462
If he doesn't, the sun will destroy him.

58:21.548 --> 58:23.015
Scooby, you did it!

58:23.249 --> 58:25.308
You defeated the Yowie Yahoo.

58:26.586 --> 58:28.577
He sure didn't go quietly.

58:37.096 --> 58:40.623
How about that, Scooby?
You're an honorary dingo.

58:41.401 --> 58:43.028
Dingo? Hooray!

58:50.176 --> 58:52.371
But what about the Hex Girls?

58:52.812 --> 58:56.304
We could just ask the vampires
where they are.

59:00.086 --> 59:01.713
Quick! Over the bridge!

59:02.388 --> 59:04.379
Don't worry gang. I've got you!

59:04.624 --> 59:07.092
As long as you've got us and they don't!

59:09.362 --> 59:13.799
The sunlight destroyed the Yowie Yahoo.
Why isn't it destroying Wildwind?

59:15.134 --> 59:17.967
You want to stop and ask them
or keep on running?

59:18.204 --> 59:19.296
No thanks.

59:20.106 --> 59:21.767
We just crossed running water.

59:21.841 --> 59:24.435
The vampires shouldn't be able
to follow us.

59:25.345 --> 59:27.813
Didn't those vampires read the rule book?

59:40.226 --> 59:41.284
Now!

01:00:03.216 --> 01:00:04.911
Nice work, Daniel.

01:00:17.964 --> 01:00:21.161
I didn't think anything
would stop those vampires.

01:00:21.934 --> 01:00:24.095
That's because they're not real vampires.

01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:27.230
If they were,
they wouldn't have been captured on film.

01:00:28.007 --> 01:00:29.372
Jolly good work.

01:00:29.942 --> 01:00:31.705
You've snared the vampires.

01:00:32.178 --> 01:00:34.874
Now we can find out
what happened to the bands.

01:00:34.981 --> 01:00:38.041
At first we thought
the Bad Omens were behind all this.

01:00:38.651 --> 01:00:42.018
But when they disappeared,
we had to search for new suspects.

01:00:49.862 --> 01:00:52.387
Well, I'll be. Two Skinny Dudes.

01:00:53.266 --> 01:00:55.700
That's two vampires. Who's the third?

01:00:58.738 --> 01:00:59.966
Russell!

01:01:00.573 --> 01:01:03.804
Russell, you were my partner.
This doesn't make any sense.

01:01:04.210 --> 01:01:05.802
I'm with Daniel.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.780
Nobody say anything.

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:12.244
That's fine.

01:01:12.385 --> 01:01:15.912
We can do all the talking and still
get to the bottom of this mystery.

01:01:15.988 --> 01:01:18.821
It took us a while
to put all the pieces together.

01:01:19.158 --> 01:01:22.753
When we saw Jasper getting so chummy
with the Two Skinny Dudes...

01:01:23.029 --> 01:01:25.497
we thought he might be the third vampire.

01:01:25.898 --> 01:01:26.887
Me?

01:01:27.133 --> 01:01:29.328
I could never wear all that makeup.

01:01:29.535 --> 01:01:31.628
I've got very sensitive skin.

01:01:31.938 --> 01:01:34.406
You managed the Bad Omens, Jasper.

01:01:34.674 --> 01:01:36.642
We thought you took
some of their makeup...

01:01:36.709 --> 01:01:40.805
so you and the Two Skinny Dudes
could copy Wildwind's glam-rock look.

01:01:41.214 --> 01:01:44.672
We also paid a visit to your trailer
when you said you'd be there.

01:01:44.751 --> 01:01:46.651
You were nowhere to be found.

01:01:46.853 --> 01:01:48.320
That's not a crime.

01:01:49.655 --> 01:01:53.284
Okay. Confession time.

01:01:53.659 --> 01:01:55.126
I wasn't in my trailer...

01:01:55.194 --> 01:01:58.857
because I was meeting with
the Hex Girls about being their manager.

01:01:59.232 --> 01:02:02.395
I didn't want the Bad Omens
to find out what I was doing.

01:02:02.502 --> 01:02:06.939
But that doesn't explain why you have
costumes like the ones Wildwind wore.

01:02:07.473 --> 01:02:10.465
Wildwind was the greatest band
I ever managed.

01:02:10.610 --> 01:02:15.274
I had those costumes made to remind me
of all the good times we had together.

01:02:16.616 --> 01:02:18.675
I wish I knew what happened to them.

01:02:18.751 --> 01:02:20.776
Why don't you ask them yourself?

01:02:21.988 --> 01:02:23.080
What the....

01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:26.285
Okay. Now I'm really confused.

01:02:27.126 --> 01:02:28.320
Me, too.

01:02:39.238 --> 01:02:40.967
Recognize them now?

01:02:43.276 --> 01:02:46.939
I don't believe it. Wildwind, you're alive.

01:02:47.647 --> 01:02:50.138
We should have won
that contest last year.

01:02:50.383 --> 01:02:53.011
When we didn't, we decided to disappear.

01:02:54.954 --> 01:02:58.685
We thought disappearing mysteriously
would help our careers.

01:03:01.427 --> 01:03:03.486
Then we remembered
the rules of the contest...

01:03:03.563 --> 01:03:05.428
meant we couldn't enter again.

01:03:05.731 --> 01:03:08.029
We planned on making
a triumphant return...

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:10.261
at this year's unsigned-band contest.

01:03:14.173 --> 01:03:17.574
Right. That's when you came up with
a way to get around those rules...

01:03:17.643 --> 01:03:20.168
and make sure you'd win
this year's contest.

01:03:21.981 --> 01:03:25.041
With Dark Skull already posing
as Russell...

01:03:25.151 --> 01:03:29.053
Stormy Weathers and Lightning Strikes
became the Two Skinny Dudes...

01:03:29.155 --> 01:03:31.521
an unsigned band in the contest.

01:03:34.794 --> 01:03:38.525
The three of them then took advantage
of the local legend surrounding them...

01:03:38.598 --> 01:03:40.862
and disguised themselves as vampires.

01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:46.698
They planned to kidnap
all the other bands in the contest.

01:03:46.873 --> 01:03:49.774
Then, Two Skinny Dudes
would be declared the winner.

01:03:50.443 --> 01:03:53.844
But the crowd wouldn't see the
Two Skinny Dudes close out the festival.

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:56.746
Instead, Wildwind would come on stage
and perform.

01:03:56.983 --> 01:04:00.316
They hoped all the attention
from closing the show at Vampire Rock...

01:04:00.386 --> 01:04:02.513
would make their careers take off.

01:04:02.722 --> 01:04:04.383
I'm starting to get it.

01:04:04.824 --> 01:04:08.453
But if they're not vampires,
how did they fly?

01:04:10.062 --> 01:04:13.259
Easy, Shaggy.
Their mountain-climbing equipment.

01:04:23.075 --> 01:04:27.171
They rigged it to the stage so they could
swoop down and kidnap the acts.

01:04:29.215 --> 01:04:31.706
This is all very interesting.

01:04:32.218 --> 01:04:35.415
But will somebody please tell me
where the Bad Omens are?

01:04:35.855 --> 01:04:37.789
That's one answer we don't have.

01:04:37.857 --> 01:04:42.419
We sent them and Matt Marvelous
on diving trips to the Great Barrier Reef.

01:04:42.962 --> 01:04:45.362
All expenses paid. They were thrilled.

01:04:47.833 --> 01:04:52.202
You should have just asked us.
I've been wanting to leave since I got here.

01:04:53.606 --> 01:04:55.335
We didn't really kidnap anybody.

01:04:55.408 --> 01:04:58.502
What about the Hex Girls?
They weren't your competition.

01:04:58.978 --> 01:05:00.240
But you were.

01:05:00.379 --> 01:05:02.313
We knew you would come after them...

01:05:02.381 --> 01:05:05.407
giving us the chance
to send you on your way as well.

01:05:05.484 --> 01:05:07.145
Where are the Hex Girls now?

01:05:07.219 --> 01:05:08.379
Don't worry.

01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:12.516
We're fine.

01:05:13.492 --> 01:05:17.053
Thorn, Dusk, Luna! You're all right.

01:05:17.863 --> 01:05:21.390
Those creepy guys took us back
to their hideout in Vampire Rock.

01:05:21.667 --> 01:05:25.660
They offered us a free trip if we
would leave the festival, but we refused.

01:05:26.272 --> 01:05:29.105
So they took us into the outback
and left us there.

01:05:29.408 --> 01:05:31.706
They knew we'd keep looking
until we found you...

01:05:31.777 --> 01:05:34.041
making us miss our chance to perform.

01:05:34.113 --> 01:05:37.640
And leave Two Skinny Dudes
as the only group left in the contest.

01:05:38.050 --> 01:05:40.541
How did you find your way back here?

01:05:41.787 --> 01:05:45.348
We wandered around the outback
for hours, until Malcolm found us.

01:05:45.825 --> 01:05:49.420
The way they were dressed,
I first thought they were vampires, too.

01:05:49.629 --> 01:05:51.859
There are no vampires, Grandfather.

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:55.895
Daniel's right, Mr. Illiwara.
Wildwind is definitely human.

01:05:56.302 --> 01:06:00.295
They used smoke whenever they flew,
so no one could see their climbing ropes.

01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:02.705
You helped us figure that part out, sir.

01:06:02.775 --> 01:06:07.337
They burned wood from the red gum tree,
making sweet smoke like your signals.

01:06:07.647 --> 01:06:11.947
And like, that's why we also found
a boot print made from red gum on stage.

01:06:12.351 --> 01:06:14.148
What about the Yowie Yahoo?

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.018
We've got an explanation for that, too.

01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:19.055
I'm sure you do.

01:06:19.625 --> 01:06:22.458
Wildwind spent a lot of time
perfecting their act.

01:06:22.728 --> 01:06:24.889
They're masters of special effects.

01:06:25.498 --> 01:06:29.161
They used pictures of the Yowie Yahoo
to help pull off their hoax.

01:06:29.635 --> 01:06:32.195
They placed the pictures
on holographic disks.

01:06:32.271 --> 01:06:34.466
When light was shined through the disks...

01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:37.668
three-dimensional images
of the Yowie Yahoo were created.

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:42.078
These images could be beamed anywhere
to help Wildwind with their plan.

01:06:42.915 --> 01:06:45.543
To make the Yowie Yahoo
even more realistic...

01:06:45.918 --> 01:06:48.182
they added fire, wind and explosions.

01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:52.314
So because he was just a projection...

01:06:52.425 --> 01:06:56.589
the sunlight reflecting off Scooby's tag,
made the Yowie Yahoo disappear.

01:06:56.996 --> 01:06:58.258
Bingo, Shaggy.

01:06:58.497 --> 01:07:01.398
Thanks to Scooby,
we were able to solve the mystery.

01:07:08.107 --> 01:07:09.665
I'm sorry, Daniel...

01:07:09.742 --> 01:07:13.678
for letting my belief in the vampire legend
get in the way of your show.

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:16.513
Wildwind had us all fooled, Grandfather.

01:07:16.682 --> 01:07:20.846
And we would have gotten away with it,
too, if it weren't for you meddling kids.

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:24.083
Since all the other bands in the contest
are eliminated...

01:07:24.156 --> 01:07:25.919
that makes you guys the winner.

01:07:26.492 --> 01:07:28.756
Does that mean what I think it means?

01:07:33.232 --> 01:07:38.192
And now I'd like to introduce the final act
in this year's Vampire Rock Music Festival.

01:07:39.071 --> 01:07:42.472
But first, did everyone have a good time?

01:07:45.978 --> 01:07:48.811
I said, did everybody have a good time?

01:07:53.452 --> 01:07:55.545
I'm not having a good time.

01:07:56.622 --> 01:07:59.022
Come on, Velma, this is going to be fun.

01:07:59.859 --> 01:08:04.728
But there's so many people. Besides,
we don't even have a name for our group.

01:08:04.997 --> 01:08:06.089
Name?

01:08:06.298 --> 01:08:10.735
And now, help me welcome
the Meddling Kids!

01:08:10.970 --> 01:08:12.403
Meddling Kids?

01:08:13.072 --> 01:08:14.300
Works for me!

01:12:04.803 --> 01:12:06.828
English

01:12:07.305 --> 01:12:13.824
