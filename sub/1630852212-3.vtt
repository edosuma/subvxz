BARCELONA, 1993

00:18.199 --> 00:21.030
Hi, son, are you OK?

00:21.050 --> 00:22.059
Give me five.

00:22.079 --> 00:24.019
We'll be going home soon.

00:24.039 --> 00:25.219
Hi, Ricardo, thank you for
coming.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.170
We'd like to talk to you
about a rather delicate subject.

00:28.190 --> 00:29.109
Let's go inside.

00:31.120 --> 00:33.049
We got the test results,

00:33.070 --> 00:36.000
and they show that Gari
has some learning disabilities.

00:36.020 --> 00:37.049
He finds it hard to read,

00:37.070 --> 00:39.149
he's slowing down the class,
and if he keeps on like this...

00:39.170 --> 00:41.100
-...he'll have to...
-Come on!

00:41.119 --> 00:44.090
If you were good teachers,
my son would know how to read
properly.

00:44.109 --> 00:46.009
It has nothing to do with the
teachers.

00:46.030 --> 00:47.200
-But...
-Gari has a problem.

00:47.219 --> 00:49.109
He keeps falling behind
and he needs special education.

00:49.130 --> 00:51.219
Don't worry, Gari won't slow
down
your classes any more.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.039
-That's not the issue...
-Shove your tests up your arse!

00:54.060 --> 00:55.149
-Please, Ricardo!
-Let's go, Gari.

00:55.170 --> 00:57.189
We can look for alternatives.

00:59.170 --> 01:02.229
Listen to me carefully: you're
not stupid.

01:03.140 --> 01:06.159
You'll be able to do
whatever you set your mind to.

01:07.129 --> 01:09.129
Tell me: what does it say there?

01:11.039 --> 01:13.030
RULES OF COEXISTENCE

01:13.049 --> 01:15.010
Come on, son, what does it say?

01:15.030 --> 01:16.150
You can do it.

01:20.150 --> 01:22.010
I'm pregnant.

01:23.219 --> 01:25.069
It's yours.

01:27.180 --> 01:30.039
But don't worry. It's fine.
Really.

01:30.060 --> 01:33.049
Look, I have the...
I have an ultrasound and
everything.

01:33.069 --> 01:34.090
-Look, look.
-No.

01:34.109 --> 01:36.200
-See?
-No.

01:36.219 --> 01:38.060
Look, it's...

01:38.079 --> 01:40.000
-No, I can't see anything.
-The size of a chickpea.

01:40.109 --> 01:41.159
This chickpea...

01:43.229 --> 01:46.039
-Is it a baby?
-Well, not exactly.

01:46.060 --> 01:48.120
Not even a foetus, it's an
embryo.

01:49.060 --> 01:50.120
I have to go.

01:55.030 --> 01:56.039
Hey!

01:56.060 --> 01:58.129
-I didn't come to ask you for
anything.
-Right, right...

01:58.150 --> 01:59.210
Just to let you know.

01:59.229 --> 02:01.170
I get that you haven't thought
about having kids,

02:01.189 --> 02:05.019
but this chickpea I'm carrying
is yours as well and you need to
know.

02:05.040 --> 02:06.030
Why?

02:06.109 --> 02:08.150
Because having a child is
important.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.050
No, no...

02:10.069 --> 02:14.180
I mean why do you think
I've never thought of having
kids?

02:16.090 --> 02:18.060
Have you thought about it?

02:18.150 --> 02:19.159
Yes.

02:20.050 --> 02:22.069
And didn't they tell you
that...?

02:22.090 --> 02:25.000
Did they recommend that you...?

02:25.090 --> 02:27.000
Since you're...

02:27.020 --> 02:29.170
-I mean, people like you...
-People like me...

02:30.199 --> 02:33.139
You mean people with a
disability?

02:35.069 --> 02:36.159
Yes.

02:37.139 --> 02:39.129
Because what you have...

02:39.150 --> 02:41.159
I have a 43% disability.

02:41.180 --> 02:47.110
A 35% intellectual disability...

02:48.110 --> 02:50.129
and 8% physical disability in a
leg.

02:52.170 --> 02:54.069
-Out of 100?
-Yes.

02:57.120 --> 02:58.170
That's nothing!

02:58.189 --> 03:01.189
It's nothing.
I mean, it's nothing out of 100!

03:01.210 --> 03:03.090
-You can't tell.
-Right.

03:03.110 --> 03:05.189
Well, you can tell a bit, but
not much.

03:05.210 --> 03:07.139
I mean, we had it off and...

03:07.159 --> 03:09.080
I had it off with you...

03:09.189 --> 03:12.099
I would have had it off with
you...

03:15.080 --> 03:17.180
What I'm trying to tell you is
that...

03:17.199 --> 03:22.000
Since the chickpea I'm carrying
inside
has both our genes...

03:22.159 --> 03:25.189
we need to know what you DNA is
like.

03:25.210 --> 03:29.180
And if your disability is
genetic.

03:31.009 --> 03:33.139
What you just asked me is rude.

03:34.009 --> 03:35.210
Now, if you don't mind...

03:41.099 --> 03:42.219
I'm such a retard!

03:45.039 --> 03:47.229
PERFECT LIFE

03:48.009 --> 03:51.110
WHEN YOU TAKE AN UNEXPECTED PATH

03:56.020 --> 03:57.079
Mery...

03:57.199 --> 03:58.219
Shall we go?

03:59.189 --> 04:02.229
Hey, do you know what kind of
disability
your gardener has?

04:03.009 --> 04:05.030
Gari?
No idea, why?

04:06.099 --> 04:07.129
Because...

04:09.030 --> 04:11.020
-I have something to tell you.
-What!

04:11.129 --> 04:15.039
Shall we stay here gabbing
and leave the kids locked in the
car?

04:17.110 --> 04:20.009
-What is it with you, you're
acting weird.
-Bye.

04:23.100 --> 04:24.189
But how?

04:25.069 --> 04:27.230
Well... the way you make babies.

04:28.149 --> 04:30.100
Paula's party,
in the bouncy castle.

04:30.120 --> 04:32.009
What about the bouncy castle?

04:32.029 --> 04:35.110
Nothing, Gari and me were
jumping around.

04:35.129 --> 04:39.079
But didn't you realise that Gari
is a bit...?

04:39.189 --> 04:41.120
I mean, he's a little bit...

04:41.139 --> 04:43.019
You say special needs.

04:43.040 --> 04:46.090
-What's a person with special
needs?
-Well you know, sweetheart.

04:46.110 --> 04:48.170
Gari finds it hard
to do certain things.

04:48.189 --> 04:51.079
Do I have special needs?

04:52.050 --> 04:53.220
No you don't, sweetheart. Why?

04:54.100 --> 04:56.000
Because reading is hard for me.

04:56.019 --> 04:59.009
And you're a person
with special needs, too,

04:59.029 --> 05:01.170
because you find it really hard
to make fried eggs.

05:01.189 --> 05:03.040
-Really!
-Yes.

05:03.060 --> 05:05.120
But what do you want to do,
sweetie?

05:07.009 --> 05:08.149
I want...

05:08.170 --> 05:10.000
I want to be a mother.

05:11.209 --> 05:13.019
And...

05:13.040 --> 05:15.170
I'm pregnant, right?
So there you have it.

05:17.110 --> 05:21.009
I want to be a mother and I'm
pregnant.
In theory, it's perfect!

05:22.149 --> 05:24.220
Turns out it's not that cool.

05:27.110 --> 05:29.170
-And I don't have many eggs
left.
-Okay...

05:29.189 --> 05:31.069
Here we go with the egg drama.

05:31.089 --> 05:33.120
Let's take it bit by bit, okay?

05:33.139 --> 05:35.189
Okay? The first thing
is to have a test done.

05:35.209 --> 05:37.110
We do that and take it from
there.

05:37.129 --> 05:39.170
We make decisions depending
on the result.

05:40.139 --> 05:42.230
If things aren't as good
as they should be,

05:43.009 --> 05:45.170
and you decide to go ahead,
we'll be with you.

05:46.050 --> 05:47.230
-Are you listening to me?
-Yes.

05:48.009 --> 05:49.170
Lots of women have kids like
that.

05:49.189 --> 05:51.050
Remember Joaquim and Joana?

05:51.069 --> 05:53.040
Remember them,
the bookshop people?

05:53.060 --> 05:54.209
-I don't' remember a thing.
-Yes!

05:54.230 --> 05:57.129
She had a Down syndrome baby
and they're super happy.

05:57.149 --> 06:00.050
But I think that...
It's just my opinion, eh?

06:00.069 --> 06:03.060
Maybe we could consider an
abortion.

06:04.040 --> 06:06.050
Or at least think about it,
Mery.

06:06.069 --> 06:08.129
-What does abortion mean, mummy?
-It's...

06:09.120 --> 06:12.170
-It's when women..
-Imagine you have a doll...

06:12.189 --> 06:14.079
Please, Esther, give it a rest!

06:15.050 --> 06:17.079
Mummy will explain when we get
home.

06:17.100 --> 06:19.120
I'm a cup,

06:19.230 --> 06:21.160
a teapot,

06:21.180 --> 06:23.180
-a spoon..
-Kids, sweetie.

06:23.199 --> 06:24.220
And a ladle.

08:01.019 --> 08:02.139
-Yes?
-Mummy.

08:02.160 --> 08:04.129
-What is it, sweetheart?
-I need a wee.

08:04.149 --> 08:06.089
Okay, I'll be right out.

08:09.100 --> 08:11.220
DELETE THIS CONTACT?

08:19.209 --> 08:21.180
Painter,

08:21.199 --> 08:23.209
you paint with love!

08:29.069 --> 08:30.160
So tacky.

08:52.080 --> 08:56.159
Hi, Joana. I'm MarÃ­a, Cris's
friend.

08:56.179 --> 09:02.080
I'd like you to tell me
about your daughter, could we
meet?

09:15.120 --> 09:20.200
What is it like
living with a disabled person?

09:24.210 --> 09:26.120
Good night.

09:28.039 --> 09:30.100
Good night.

09:40.100 --> 09:42.149
SHARE

09:56.070 --> 09:57.129
Mery...

09:57.149 --> 10:00.080
Have the test done,
then we'll see, okay?

10:01.029 --> 10:02.149
Don't worry.

10:03.169 --> 10:04.179
Okay.

10:06.120 --> 10:07.190
I love you.

10:08.179 --> 10:09.210
Me too.

10:11.129 --> 10:14.000
Is the father normal?
Is your daughter happy?

10:14.019 --> 10:17.049
Will I regret it?
I am ready?

10:17.070 --> 10:20.070
What will the baby's future be
like?
And being a single mother?

10:20.090 --> 10:25.090
Should I abort?
How does Gari fit into this
equation?

10:25.110 --> 10:27.220
Special offer on chickpeas
today:

10:28.000 --> 10:31.200
0,99 for the first unit,
half price for the second one!

10:38.129 --> 10:39.210
Hey, Gari.

10:39.230 --> 10:41.009
Hey, Richi.

10:41.029 --> 10:43.049
What? Can't make up your mind?

10:43.070 --> 10:44.159
-No.
-No?

10:45.029 --> 10:49.159
Look, since we're looking at
chickpeas,
I suggest you make hummus.

10:50.200 --> 10:55.190
-And what's hummus?
-You mash up the chickpeas,

10:55.210 --> 10:57.200
until you make a paste.

10:58.139 --> 11:01.230
Why don't you go and look
for the tuna fish, please?

11:02.139 --> 11:05.220
-God, you're in a mood today!
-Yeah, I am. That's life...

11:19.080 --> 11:22.220
...a fragment of placental
villi.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.190
Testing will determine
if there are abnormalities in
the foetus.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.009
Crap, will they take the blood
from you or the baby?

11:30.029 --> 11:31.210
It's a biopsy of the placenta.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.200
Don't talk, I might hurt you.

11:34.220 --> 11:37.149
Imagine the poor little foetus
watching the needle go in.

11:37.169 --> 11:39.220
Esther, I'm going to hurt you!

11:40.000 --> 11:42.149
I was saying that it's okay
if you want to abort.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.100
You're overthinking it.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.220
Having a baby in those
conditions
is a really big deal.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.009
Don't freak out about the
operation,

11:50.029 --> 11:52.120
because it's super quick
and almost doesn't hurt.

11:52.139 --> 11:54.190
Well, you feel sort of cramps.

11:54.210 --> 11:56.220
But wouldn't you rather
go through that

11:57.000 --> 11:59.129
than regret having it
for the rest of your life?

12:00.110 --> 12:01.220
How do you know about the
cramps?

12:03.139 --> 12:04.149
Well...

12:05.059 --> 12:09.080
Don't you remember when NÃºria
cheated on me with a guy

12:09.100 --> 12:11.019
and got pregnant and had an
abortion?

12:11.159 --> 12:14.139
That's what I mean,
I was the one who cheated on
her.

12:15.070 --> 12:17.200
You had an abortion
without telling me?

12:17.220 --> 12:19.059
Jesus, MarÃ­a the Inquisitor!

12:19.080 --> 12:21.110
-I'm telling you now.
-But I'm your sister.

12:21.129 --> 12:23.019
A friend's cousin

12:23.039 --> 12:25.009
gave birth without knowing
she was pregnant.

12:25.029 --> 12:28.019
I swear.
Of course, she was a bit of a
fatty,

12:28.039 --> 12:30.059
so she didn't notice
for nine months.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.169
Incredible, she even got her
period.

12:38.210 --> 12:41.080
How's it going?
I'm following you on Instagram,

12:41.100 --> 12:42.190
you didn't follow me back.

12:42.210 --> 12:45.049
You what?
How do you know I have
Instagram?

12:45.070 --> 12:47.000
Because I got notified.

12:47.019 --> 12:48.230
Bloody hell. I'm clueless.

12:49.009 --> 12:51.210
You said it.
You've published 13 posts in a
day.

12:51.230 --> 12:54.049
You can't post that much stuff
in one day.

12:54.070 --> 12:55.090
No?

12:55.110 --> 12:58.039
And work on the photos,
you're supposed to be an artist.

13:04.039 --> 13:05.059
What's up?

13:05.179 --> 13:08.029
Hey, you know about computers.

13:08.110 --> 13:10.139
How do you restore a deleted
contact?

13:10.159 --> 13:11.220
From the computer?

13:12.000 --> 13:13.110
No, from a mobile.

13:13.220 --> 13:16.210
An old friend from university
gave me his number

13:16.230 --> 13:18.190
and somehow I deleted it.

13:18.210 --> 13:20.149
I'll look for the IT guy, he'll
know.

13:20.169 --> 13:22.100
No, no.
No need, no need.

13:22.120 --> 13:24.110
I'll look for him on Facebook.

13:24.200 --> 13:25.210
Thanks.

14:49.039 --> 14:51.110
Now you're on fire!

14:52.190 --> 14:54.059
And it...

14:54.149 --> 14:56.190
It tastes great.

14:56.210 --> 15:00.129
What's more, a couple of mates
and me
went on a boat,

15:00.149 --> 15:03.139
we tried it, and it was
fantastic!

15:03.159 --> 15:05.070
-What are you on about?
-Guys...

15:06.049 --> 15:08.009
Do you wanna have kids?

15:08.029 --> 15:11.009
I had a vasectomy just in case.

15:11.029 --> 15:13.159
The thought of having kids
stresses me out.

15:14.149 --> 15:16.110
I'm gonna be a father.

15:17.120 --> 15:18.230
Listen to him!

15:19.110 --> 15:21.139
Who with? Nuri?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.009
Hey, what's wrong with Nuri?
She's my mate.

15:24.029 --> 15:25.120
No!

15:25.139 --> 15:27.210
I'm gonna be a father now.

15:27.230 --> 15:31.049
-You what?
-I got a girl pregnant.

15:31.179 --> 15:33.080
Are you pulling my leg,

15:33.200 --> 15:36.110
are you having me on,
or do you really mean it?

15:38.049 --> 15:39.059
I mean it.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.149
Jesus.

15:41.169 --> 15:44.080
You're gonna get lumbered with
it.

15:44.100 --> 15:46.210
What did your dad say?

15:46.230 --> 15:48.190
My dad...

15:50.049 --> 15:51.129
he doesn't know.

15:51.210 --> 15:54.070
-And XosÃ©?
-XosÃ© doesn't know either.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.039
Jesus...

15:57.100 --> 15:59.190
Swear to me you won't tell
anyone.

15:59.210 --> 16:02.049
-Swearing is a sin.
-Okay.

16:02.139 --> 16:04.019
Promise, then.

16:04.129 --> 16:05.220
You have my word.

16:06.159 --> 16:09.059
Okay, dude. You have my word.

16:18.059 --> 16:20.070
WAITING ROOM

16:33.149 --> 16:35.090
CHORIONIC BIOPSY

16:35.110 --> 16:36.179
MarÃ­a Aguado?

16:40.110 --> 16:41.139
That's me.

16:42.090 --> 16:44.019
Let's begin, MarÃ­a.

16:45.139 --> 16:46.100
Breathe...

16:49.169 --> 16:51.009
That's good.

16:52.190 --> 16:54.039
That's good.

16:58.159 --> 17:01.149
Don't worry.
Everything is going fine.

17:04.109 --> 17:05.220
Well, that's that.

17:06.109 --> 17:07.180
-Is it over?
-Yes.

17:08.049 --> 17:10.230
Rest for 24 hours and you're
good to go.

17:11.009 --> 17:15.049
-What do you mean rest?
-Don't go out dancing.

17:15.069 --> 17:18.099
Stay at home, watch a film,
read a good book...

17:18.119 --> 17:19.230
That way you don't worry.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.170
Right...

17:21.190 --> 17:24.210
And... when will you give me
the results?

17:25.160 --> 17:27.079
In about three days or so.

17:27.099 --> 17:29.089
We'll send them to your
gynaecologist.

17:29.109 --> 17:30.119
Okay.

17:34.119 --> 17:35.130
And don't worry.

17:36.160 --> 17:38.059
Everything will be fine.

17:48.039 --> 17:51.150
Congratulations, you guys,
the kitchen looks amazing.

17:51.220 --> 17:56.009
I'm so proud of how you're all
taking care of the flat.

17:57.079 --> 18:00.230
And I had a word
with the people at the centre...

18:01.190 --> 18:04.079
and you guys are ready to live
by yourselves.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.119
Do you fancy living by
yourselves?

18:11.160 --> 18:13.009
Is something up?

18:13.029 --> 18:15.009
Nothing. What you do mean?

18:19.009 --> 18:19.220
Gari...

18:20.220 --> 18:21.230
Gari,

18:22.009 --> 18:23.109
did you have a row?

18:24.170 --> 18:25.220
No.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.039
All right, look...

18:27.190 --> 18:28.140
We'll talk about it later.

18:28.160 --> 18:32.069
-Who made this?
-I got a girl pregnant.

18:44.220 --> 18:46.019
Hi, gorgeous.

18:50.009 --> 18:52.009
-How are you?
-Good.

18:52.029 --> 18:53.160
Did it go okay?

18:53.230 --> 18:55.130
Yes, it went okay.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.099
Really quick...

18:57.200 --> 18:59.089
-And it was fine.
-Good.

18:59.170 --> 19:01.180
-All right...
-Now we wait.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.160
Thanks for asking.

19:09.039 --> 19:10.190
Hey, listen.

19:12.009 --> 19:14.049
Was it tough for you when you
aborted?

19:17.119 --> 19:19.019
It wasn't very pleasant.

19:19.190 --> 19:24.009
Then I panicked thinking
they'd tear me apart inside...

19:24.130 --> 19:26.220
I felt a bit sorry...

19:27.000 --> 19:30.119
And when I left the clinic,
I felt completely liberated...

19:31.160 --> 19:33.190
-You've never regretted it?
-No way!

19:33.210 --> 19:37.170
What I would have regretted
is having a baby I didn't want.

19:38.140 --> 19:40.099
Are you thinking of aborting?

19:44.019 --> 19:45.119
Yes, now and again.

19:48.069 --> 19:50.190
And then, at times...

19:52.130 --> 19:53.200
I want to have it.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.140
-Come here.
-I don't know.

20:00.059 --> 20:02.130
I'm a granddad, but I'm a man,
know what I mean?

20:02.150 --> 20:05.039
-Hello.
-Cristina will be taking your
case.

20:05.059 --> 20:06.079
-How are you?
-Hello.

20:06.099 --> 20:08.089
-Nice to meet you.
-Can I have the draft?

20:08.109 --> 20:12.009
As I was saying, if I registered
on the dating site for married
men

20:12.029 --> 20:13.109
it was because I couldn't stand
it.

20:13.130 --> 20:16.029
In petitions for divorce,
the reason is not relevant.

20:16.049 --> 20:19.220
It wasn't because of my lovers.
It was because of my
grandchildren.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.230
I've gone from being a man
to being a granddad.

20:23.009 --> 20:25.000
I like being with my
grandchildren,

20:25.019 --> 20:28.079
but I also like going out,
getting spruced up, having a
drink...

20:29.029 --> 20:31.119
And why not, screwing now and
again?

20:31.140 --> 20:33.220
I didn't do any of that
with my wife anymore.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.039
We were just grandparents.
Do you know what I mean?

20:37.160 --> 20:40.019
Don't worry,
you're in very good hands here.

20:40.089 --> 20:43.059
Live your life,
we'll deal with all the rest.

20:45.180 --> 20:47.200
Jesus, what a load of crap!

20:48.190 --> 20:50.230
You're so pathetic, Esther.

20:55.160 --> 20:58.029
Hi! I really like your painting.

21:03.019 --> 21:06.109
It's my favourite.

21:09.210 --> 21:12.119
There's one that I like even
more.

21:15.210 --> 21:18.039
But I only posted one painting.

21:18.170 --> 21:21.000
Oh, right. I got mixed up.

21:22.079 --> 21:24.130
Your smile is a work of art,
too.

21:26.180 --> 21:30.049
I see you're from Barcelona.
Fancy a drink this afternoon?

21:30.069 --> 21:32.130
I'm a dyke.

21:32.150 --> 21:34.200
No need to be like that.

21:34.220 --> 21:37.019
I was being polite.

21:37.039 --> 21:40.200
My son is eleven
and paints better than you,
BITCH

I said always use a condom!

With a condom, please!

23:06.130 --> 23:08.200
And who did you get pregnant?
Nuri?

23:09.109 --> 23:11.069
It's not Nuri!

23:11.089 --> 23:12.119
Another girl.

23:12.140 --> 23:15.109
She's not disabled and he met
her
at a party,

23:15.130 --> 23:16.190
but that isn't the problem.

23:16.210 --> 23:18.009
-Meaning?
-No.

23:18.029 --> 23:20.029
We have to meet her, talk to
her.

23:20.049 --> 23:21.230
I suppose she wants to abort.

23:22.009 --> 23:24.059
Well, she might want to have it.

23:24.079 --> 23:25.180
What do you mean have it?

23:25.200 --> 23:27.099
It's her decision.

23:27.119 --> 23:30.109
Yes, right. She decides,
but she can't force him to do
anything.

23:30.130 --> 23:31.190
Normally that's the case.

23:32.039 --> 23:33.160
What then?

23:34.000 --> 23:35.210
Gari has something to tell you.

23:36.140 --> 23:37.210
Tell me what?

23:39.029 --> 23:41.019
What is it?
What do you want to tell me?

23:41.039 --> 23:42.119
What's up?

23:42.210 --> 23:45.049
-Tell him.
-What do you want to tell me?

23:45.069 --> 23:46.180
You tell him, please.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.069
What's going on?

23:48.150 --> 23:49.230
Let's see...

23:52.009 --> 23:53.160
Gari wants to keep it.

23:55.069 --> 23:56.190
He wants to be a father.

24:02.220 --> 24:04.019
Dad...

24:04.039 --> 24:07.210
You always told me
that if I make an effort,

24:07.230 --> 24:10.089
I can be whoever I want to be,
right?

24:14.009 --> 24:15.200
Well this is what I want.

24:16.210 --> 24:18.119
Yes, son. Yes.

24:19.130 --> 24:24.109
I meant getting a job,
opening a bank account...
whatever.

24:25.029 --> 24:28.059
But not having kids, you know?
It's too much for you.

24:28.079 --> 24:29.230
Having kids is too much.

24:30.009 --> 24:31.210
You're not even ready to live
alone.

24:31.230 --> 24:33.019
That isn't true.

24:33.039 --> 24:35.089
-Gari is perfectly ready...
-Do you have kids?

24:35.109 --> 24:37.039
-No, but...
-Have you gone mad?

24:37.059 --> 24:38.200
It's one thing to be open
minded,

24:38.220 --> 24:41.130
and another to encourage him
to make bad decisions.

24:41.150 --> 24:43.019
Excuse me.

24:43.079 --> 24:46.210
Excuse me, I'm just going to the
toilet,
okay?

25:24.150 --> 25:25.210
Whatever it is, tell me.

25:25.230 --> 25:27.109
It's all right, really.

25:29.029 --> 25:32.069
It makes me a bit nervous
when you doctors do that, you
know?

25:33.150 --> 25:35.119
-Here.
-What?

25:35.140 --> 25:36.200
Read it.

25:37.099 --> 25:38.230
-Me?
-Yes.

25:44.049 --> 25:45.190
"Chromosome 21:

25:46.109 --> 25:49.190
Absence of... aneuploidy."

25:51.119 --> 25:52.130
What's that?

25:53.059 --> 25:55.000
There's no alteration.

25:55.140 --> 25:57.000
Carry on.

25:59.220 --> 26:01.220
"Chromosome 18:

26:03.000 --> 26:05.009
Absence of aneuploidy."

26:06.069 --> 26:07.220

26:09.210 --> 26:11.230
Absence of aneuploidy."

26:14.140 --> 26:16.049

26:17.130 --> 26:18.190
Male."

26:21.019 --> 26:22.109
A boy!

26:24.220 --> 26:27.130
Everything is fine, MarÃ­a.
Everything is fine.

26:36.059 --> 26:40.000
I'm calling to cancel an
appointment
I have with you tomorrow.

26:40.079 --> 26:41.190
MarÃ­a Aguado.

26:41.210 --> 26:45.200
All right, we'll cancel
the voluntary termination of
pregnancy.

26:45.220 --> 26:47.039
Thank you.

27:23.170 --> 27:25.170
Sorry, I can't tell you where
she went.

27:25.190 --> 27:28.049
-Oh...
-I can make an appointment if
you want.

27:28.160 --> 27:30.049
No, no need.

27:30.069 --> 27:33.140
-Listen, I'll come back another
time, okay?
-Fine.

27:33.160 --> 27:35.079
Very kind of you.
Bye, thanks.

27:35.099 --> 27:36.230
-Thank you.
-Bye.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.009
-Why are you here?
-Err...

27:51.140 --> 27:53.180
Well, I came to tell you

27:53.200 --> 27:56.190
that I was deprived of oxygen
when I was born,

27:56.210 --> 27:59.059
I got tangled up in the
umbilical cord.

28:00.039 --> 28:02.160
And then my mum died...

28:03.009 --> 28:04.130
and I was left like this.

28:06.029 --> 28:08.059
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

28:08.079 --> 28:10.019
It's not your fault!

28:10.039 --> 28:13.160
Besides, there are only a few
things
I find hard to do.

28:14.009 --> 28:16.009
-It's no big deal.
-Right.

28:16.079 --> 28:17.109
Right.

28:22.089 --> 28:23.200
MarÃ­a,

28:23.220 --> 28:25.170
I wanna be a father.

28:27.109 --> 28:31.059
But only if the baby is healthy.

28:35.109 --> 28:36.210
It is.

28:43.039 --> 28:45.059
And it's a boy.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.079
That's it, then.

29:00.210 --> 29:02.130
Can I give you a hug?

29:02.150 --> 29:03.150
-Yes.
-Sure?

29:03.170 --> 29:05.039
-Sure.
-Okay.

29:13.210 --> 29:14.220
All right, then.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.089
Have a good day at work, okay?
