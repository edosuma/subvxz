[woman on PA]

01:13.742 --> 01:15.004
Kelley?

01:15.047 --> 01:16.745
[man]
We all know why we're here.

01:18.355 --> 01:19.356
Or do we?

01:19.400 --> 01:21.141
[electronic noise]

01:26.015 --> 01:29.801
[Goldstucker] If the CIA were
a financial institution,

01:29.845 --> 01:35.981
our most valuable currency
would be intelligence.

01:37.069 --> 01:44.164
Like any other currency,
it has the power to enrich
or to destroy lives.

01:45.513 --> 01:47.341
[siren wailing]

01:47.384 --> 01:51.475
[Goldstucker]
The correct intelligence

01:51.519 --> 01:53.999
can prevent such conflict.

01:54.043 --> 01:56.480
Comprehending intelligence

01:59.048 --> 02:01.311
can save thousands of lives.

02:04.271 --> 02:05.837
Ignoring intelligence...

02:05.881 --> 02:08.231
[explosions]

02:10.929 --> 02:13.454
...well, let's not
even go there.

02:17.240 --> 02:20.809
[Goldstucker] With the rapid
advancements of technology

02:21.505 --> 02:24.247
it has become
well neigh impossible

02:24.291 --> 02:29.948
to secure critical intelligence from falling into
the wrong hands.

02:29.992 --> 02:30.906
[gunshots]

02:32.603 --> 02:35.084
What is the optimal way

02:35.127 --> 02:41.221
to gather, transport, and secure high-risk intelligence.

02:41.264 --> 02:46.226
And what we discovered is
that our greatest security,

02:46.269 --> 02:48.271
the safest of safes,

02:48.315 --> 02:50.360
is right here

02:52.101 --> 02:54.408
in the palms of my hands.

03:04.592 --> 03:05.941
[street noises]

03:06.811 --> 03:09.031
Intelligence secured. Over.

03:11.120 --> 03:13.688
[Goldstucker] Our operation
isn't about inserting

03:13.731 --> 03:16.430
a microchip into
your existing brain.

03:18.693 --> 03:20.782
That would be simply silly.

03:20.825 --> 03:25.700
This is about
harnessing the power
your brain was born with.

03:28.355 --> 03:31.271
From that traumatic first day,

03:31.314 --> 03:34.796
your brain has been
harvesting raw data.

03:34.839 --> 03:39.148
Your sensories have been
recording every sight, sound,

03:39.191 --> 03:42.325
smell, taste, touch.

03:43.457 --> 03:48.766
There's not a more powerful
processor on this planet.

03:48.810 --> 03:53.771
Your brain processes an enormous amount of information.

03:53.815 --> 03:56.774
And it does so with ease.

03:58.080 --> 04:03.085
No computer hard drive could
remotely replicate

04:03.128 --> 04:05.305
the memory, the storage,

04:06.741 --> 04:10.353
or the encryption
of the human brain.

04:28.893 --> 04:31.505
-[Peter] Alright, Kelley.

04:32.462 --> 04:33.637

04:42.429 --> 04:43.865
[Peter]
Download that right there.

04:45.127 --> 04:47.303
Whoa... I didn't
need to see that.

04:47.347 --> 04:50.393
[Peter]
Looks like he went
to that bar. I recognize it.

04:50.437 --> 04:53.353
Come on, Kelley.
I know you got it.

04:56.965 --> 04:57.922
Flip that.

04:59.097 --> 05:00.882
[Peter]
That's what I'm talking about.

05:03.232 --> 05:05.539
Huh. Here we go...

05:08.150 --> 05:11.066
-[Peter] Hey, Kelley.
-[Kelley] Yeah?

05:11.109 --> 05:13.198
[Peter] It's been a good day
for the good guys.

05:13.242 --> 05:16.245
-Alert DHS.
-Roger that. Any specifics?

05:16.288 --> 05:18.856
No. Just that it looks like
the Golden Gate almost became

05:18.900 --> 05:21.468
Heaven's Gate
for a whole bunch of Beatniks.

05:25.254 --> 05:28.039
I'm Ava Obada with
our breaking news this hour.

05:28.083 --> 05:30.390
Uni-- [electronic jamming]
of defense are confirming

05:30.433 --> 05:33.436
moments ago that they
intercepted vital intelligence

05:33.480 --> 05:37.397
linking an apparent terrorist
plot to detonate explosives
throughout the Golden--

05:37.440 --> 05:42.358
[electronic jamming]

05:42.402 --> 05:45.056
Explosives were located...
[electronic jamming]

05:47.145 --> 05:48.582
...here and here...

05:55.850 --> 05:59.114
[woman's voice on radio]

06:06.991 --> 06:09.167
-[Kelley] Let's play
this guessing game.
-[Tess] Okay.

06:09.211 --> 06:11.474
-I'm going to kiss you
and you're going to guess.
-Okay.

06:11.518 --> 06:12.606
[giggling]

06:15.522 --> 06:17.088
-I love you.
-No, no, no.

06:17.132 --> 06:19.743
-That's not I?
-No, I has like three beats.

06:19.787 --> 06:21.484
-Ready?
-Is it L?

06:21.528 --> 06:23.181
Yeah. L.

06:23.225 --> 06:24.879
-Ready?
-Uh-huh.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.751
[beeping]

06:28.491 --> 06:29.536
O.

06:34.541 --> 06:35.498
That's what?

06:35.542 --> 06:36.934
-A V?
-A V.

06:37.761 --> 06:39.807
You ready for this? No?

06:40.938 --> 06:42.157
That's definitely an E.

06:46.988 --> 06:49.469
-Y? It's an O.
-Okay.

06:50.295 --> 06:51.383
U. Oh.

06:51.427 --> 06:52.994
-What?
-You love me.

06:53.037 --> 06:55.605
-I love you.
-You love me the most.

06:55.649 --> 06:59.130
Love you the most.

06:59.174 --> 07:02.133
-That's long.
-That's long.
That's long Morse code.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.963
[Hotchkiss] Come over here
and sit down with me.

07:06.007 --> 07:10.315
Our operatives mined
some intelligence

07:10.359 --> 07:12.709
out of a sub network yesterday.

07:12.753 --> 07:14.972
It's a 23 month long
conversation

07:15.016 --> 07:19.194
between a dozen high-ranking
terrorists from Ah Puch.

07:19.890 --> 07:22.763
These green dots here,
they indicate every time

07:22.806 --> 07:25.026
they are alluded to activities
that contain weapons

07:25.069 --> 07:29.117
or explosives
or any kind of materials
that are related to both.

07:31.075 --> 07:33.034
They're planning
one hell of a party.

07:35.602 --> 07:36.951
And we're gonna crash it.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.519
We're gonna shut them down.

07:41.477 --> 07:43.740
Unfortunately,
our intelligence didn't
include a "save the date" card.

07:44.611 --> 07:47.614
Exactly when and where we do not
know, but what we do know is

07:47.657 --> 07:49.354
that there's
information out there

07:49.398 --> 07:53.489
that will give us
the intelligence
needed to stop them.

07:53.533 --> 07:55.143
And I'm gonna send you

07:57.624 --> 08:00.844
-to go and get it.
-Yes, sir.

08:00.888 --> 08:04.195
How the hell do you think you're
going to get out of this alive
with the intelligence intact?

08:04.239 --> 08:07.895
We do not have an embassy
for a thousand miles here.

08:07.938 --> 08:10.375
We have no military
support in the area.

08:10.419 --> 08:12.639
Sounds awfully dangerous,
doesn't it, Scotty?

08:12.682 --> 08:14.858
Oh, yeah.
Everything you do makes me wet.

08:14.902 --> 08:17.208
Like... the bed and...

08:17.252 --> 08:22.518
Scotty, would you mind, uh,
starting on due diligence?

08:22.562 --> 08:26.304
-Prepare a list
of operatives, safe houses.
-Yes, sir.

08:26.348 --> 08:28.829
-I know you don't need me
to say this--
-Then don't.

08:28.872 --> 08:31.005
Well, I have to.

08:31.048 --> 08:32.354
This is a one-way ticket.

08:34.008 --> 08:36.010
These are my orders, Peter.

08:36.053 --> 08:39.187
[sighs] Kelley, as you know,

08:39.230 --> 08:42.625
my job is to not only assess
the risk of the operation,

08:42.669 --> 08:44.627
but also the risk to our agents.

08:44.671 --> 08:48.370
[Peter] This is a suicide mission. You are not this good.

08:49.501 --> 08:51.242
This is a zero-sum game.

08:51.286 --> 08:53.331
[high pitched noise]

09:00.991 --> 09:04.604
Please, don't start to worry.

09:08.651 --> 09:09.652
Do me a favor.

09:09.696 --> 09:13.308
Do me a favor: Lie to me.

09:14.701 --> 09:17.660
Tell me that you're going
to Fiji and I'll be okay.

09:17.704 --> 09:19.270
I'm going to Fiji.

09:19.314 --> 09:22.230
It doesn't work.
It doesn't work.

09:23.884 --> 09:26.190
What happened
when I went to Vietnam?

09:28.279 --> 09:29.237
You came home.

09:30.934 --> 09:33.458
-Okay. And what happened
when I went to Darfur?
-You came home.

09:34.459 --> 09:37.637
-And what happened
when I went to--
-Alright, I get it.

09:38.681 --> 09:40.770
I know. I really do.

09:42.729 --> 09:44.948
I just hate it when you go.

09:44.992 --> 09:46.646
I always come home.

09:52.042 --> 09:53.957
Can you be back
by your birthday?

09:54.697 --> 09:56.699
-I promise.
-Okay.

09:56.743 --> 09:58.527
You know?
You're going to be okay.

09:59.528 --> 10:02.618
-I'll be fine.
-You're going to be okay.

10:02.662 --> 10:03.967
I love you.

10:05.316 --> 10:07.057
I love you more.

10:25.380 --> 10:28.035
-How's Tess?
-She's fine, thanks.

10:28.775 --> 10:33.214
Updating.
Installing anti-viral vaccine.

10:33.257 --> 10:34.302
[groans]

10:36.739 --> 10:37.958
[Kelley] Argh!

10:40.221 --> 10:41.178
Argh!

10:42.353 --> 10:44.921
Relax.
Just let the vaccine take hold.

10:45.922 --> 10:48.316
-Okay?
-Yeah.

10:48.359 --> 10:51.972
You're good to go.
Hey. [whistles]

10:52.755 --> 10:57.151
[Peter] Once you pass Al-Fashir
[cross talk] you're in
no-man's-land.

10:57.194 --> 10:58.805
-You listening?
-Yeah.

11:01.024 --> 11:03.157
Oh, Scotty,
you better hope I don't die.

11:04.419 --> 11:07.988
-Chuck?
-I'm sorry, we're
fresh out of biblical names.

11:09.380 --> 11:11.600
-Don't be afraid to use it.
-That's funny.

11:11.643 --> 11:13.863
[Peter] Will you point that
away from me, please.

11:13.907 --> 11:16.474
Here, take this.
Put that in there.

11:16.518 --> 11:19.347
Er... Alright.

11:20.174 --> 11:22.480
Let's get this death march
on the road.

11:26.441 --> 11:30.837
[Kelley]
Listen, Khalid. We've known
each other how many years?

11:30.880 --> 11:33.361
I come all the way up here.

11:33.404 --> 11:34.754
All I'm asking

11:35.972 --> 11:38.061
is just for the intelligence.

11:39.410 --> 11:40.281
Nothing more.

11:48.724 --> 11:50.639
[Kelley] But I am gonna
tell you right now,

11:50.682 --> 11:53.294
this is intelligence.
It's not about me.

11:53.990 --> 11:57.124
This isn't intelligence.
It's about you.
This is about these people here.

11:57.167 --> 11:59.387
Millions upon
millions of people.

12:04.479 --> 12:07.221
[Kelley] I come up here
to save these people.

12:07.264 --> 12:09.266
Not just my people. Your people.

12:10.137 --> 12:14.054
This is about everybody.
Everybody.

12:16.796 --> 12:17.884
Come on.

12:23.324 --> 12:24.368
Thank you.

12:48.697 --> 12:50.612
Twelve countries...

12:50.655 --> 12:52.179

Argh!

the slightest compromise, the vault will automatically lock...

14:50.384 --> 14:52.473
I'm so happy you're home.

-So happy you're home.
-[knocking on the door]

14:57.695 --> 15:00.350
Ah. I can't sleep at all,
while you're away.
I've been trying to.

No, no.

15:32.687 --> 15:34.732
No, [inaudible]

[crying]

15:41.435 --> 15:42.784
[crying]

15:43.654 --> 15:45.917
[man] Are you the wife
of Kelley Chandler?

15:45.961 --> 15:48.616
You're aware that he suffered
a major head injury?

15:50.052 --> 15:53.360
We were able to relieve
the pressure on his brain
and stop the bleeding,

15:53.403 --> 15:55.275
although Kelley is in a coma.

15:55.318 --> 15:57.190
[hospital call on PA]

15:57.233 --> 15:58.278
[surgeon] We'll move him
out of recovery

15:58.321 --> 16:00.671
into intensive care.

16:00.715 --> 16:03.239
You can visit him there.
I need to caution you, though:

16:03.283 --> 16:05.763
Kelley is not responsive.

16:05.807 --> 16:09.506
So, uh, if you talk to him
or hold his hand,

16:09.550 --> 16:13.380
any reaction on his part,
will be involuntary.

16:14.337 --> 16:16.426
[crying] Kelley.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.171
-Tess.
-Oh, Tess.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.564
Okay.

16:25.435 --> 16:28.221
Amelia, why don't you go
grab your sister some water.

16:29.613 --> 16:30.571
Okay.

16:34.531 --> 16:38.231
I won't know much
until a neurologist
examines him tomorrow morning.

16:39.101 --> 16:42.104
[exhales] What?

16:42.148 --> 16:44.759
The neurologist isn't
gonna tell us anything.

16:47.544 --> 16:49.677
Tess, you know we're
doing everything

16:49.720 --> 16:52.114
in our power to find out
what happened, right?

16:53.159 --> 16:54.421
You know what happened.

16:58.294 --> 17:01.210
[man] Welcome.
Please state your name.

17:02.342 --> 17:03.647
[Tess] Tess Chandler.

17:05.214 --> 17:06.737
[man] The following
evaluation will determine

17:06.781 --> 17:09.827
your level
of emotional intelligence.

17:15.268 --> 17:18.488
[muezzin calling to prayer]

17:25.104 --> 17:28.541
[birds flapping]

17:30.283 --> 17:33.373
[eerie music]

17:37.420 --> 17:41.511
[high pitched noise]

17:46.821 --> 17:48.518
[waves crashing]

17:49.780 --> 17:52.000
[electronic noise]

17:52.043 --> 17:54.133
[traffic noises]

17:59.268 --> 18:01.749
Unfortunately, you don't need
to be a neurologist

18:01.792 --> 18:06.232
to see that the swelling
and internal bleeding
is quite severe.

18:10.236 --> 18:11.846
Do you think
that he is brain-dead?

18:13.848 --> 18:17.765
Our neurology group is
currently conducting
a series of cranial nerve tests

18:17.808 --> 18:19.984
to see if his unresponsive
state is permanent.

18:20.028 --> 18:21.595
So, at this moment I--

18:21.638 --> 18:23.858
I can't provide you
a definitive diagnosis.

18:23.901 --> 18:26.687
Doctor, in,
in your professional opinion,

18:28.950 --> 18:33.433
do you think that he's...
Do you think he is brain-dead?

18:34.695 --> 18:36.653
Based on
what we've seen thus far

18:38.394 --> 18:41.180
-most likely, yes.
-[sobs]

18:42.093 --> 18:43.312
I'm sorry, Tess.

18:45.053 --> 18:46.272
[Tess sobs]

18:47.447 --> 18:48.622
Agent Hobbs, sir.

18:49.927 --> 18:51.364
Yeah?

18:51.407 --> 18:53.366
[electronic humming]

18:54.149 --> 18:57.544
Sir, unfortunately,
we've been informed...

18:59.198 --> 19:03.245
The likelihood of Agent Chandler

19:03.289 --> 19:05.204
making a full recovery is slim.

19:06.074 --> 19:10.992
All signs point to
the loss of brain function, sir.

19:11.862 --> 19:12.733
[smacks lips]

19:13.690 --> 19:14.691
Fuck.

19:14.735 --> 19:16.737
[whirring noise]

19:24.179 --> 19:25.093
Okay.

19:26.442 --> 19:30.577
We'll have to issue, uh
an executive order to

19:31.578 --> 19:33.536
confiscate his intelligence.

19:33.580 --> 19:35.712
Sir, this is not confirmed.
It's not 100%.

19:35.756 --> 19:38.846
We're still dealing with
a living human being.

19:42.763 --> 19:46.506
No, we're dealing with millions
of human lives, Peter.

19:46.549 --> 19:49.160
-Millions of human lives.
-Right.

19:49.204 --> 19:54.427
Millions that are protected
by the talents the likes
of Agent Chandler--

19:54.470 --> 19:56.037
No. Let me
explain something, Peter.

19:56.080 --> 20:00.781
His talent is no longer
any use to us.

20:00.824 --> 20:02.739
Is it always what's useful,
or what's right and wrong?

20:02.783 --> 20:05.699
Let me explain something
to you, young Peter!

20:05.742 --> 20:08.136
The world is made up
of two things: Black and white.

20:08.179 --> 20:10.356
And there ain't
nothing in between.

20:13.446 --> 20:16.623
-With all due respect...
-No! You have your order!

20:16.666 --> 20:18.277
Do as you're told!

20:22.019 --> 20:22.933
Yes, sir.

20:27.329 --> 20:29.288
[distorted voices]

20:49.177 --> 20:52.354
[whirring noise]

21:01.102 --> 21:03.670
[high pitched buzzing]

21:19.425 --> 21:22.123
[Scotty] Boss, we're pulling
surveillance from all
around the surrounding areas.

21:22.166 --> 21:24.386
And we're pulling his medical
records, internal.

21:24.430 --> 21:27.650
-His expense reports, travel
logs. Is there anything else?
-Yeah.

21:28.390 --> 21:31.350
I'm gonna need you to issue
the executive order to Tess.

21:32.525 --> 21:35.049
What? Why me?

21:35.092 --> 21:37.181
Oh, will you grow a pair?

21:37.225 --> 21:39.836
Just throw his pocket litter
on top and you'll be fine.

21:42.796 --> 21:46.843
[automated voice]
Hello. You have reached the Central Intelligence Agency.

21:46.887 --> 21:50.543
If you know the extension of your party, please enter now.

21:51.370 --> 21:54.547
Please leave a detailed
message after the tone.

21:54.590 --> 21:57.637
[high pitched noise]

21:57.680 --> 22:00.640
The vault, it's fractured.

22:00.683 --> 22:03.382
Every move...
it's somewhere different.

22:03.425 --> 22:04.600
Every time...

22:04.644 --> 22:06.733
[Kelley] Sometimes Marrakesh.

22:07.647 --> 22:09.039
Sometimes Hong Kong.

22:09.736 --> 22:11.651
I don't know where I'm at.

22:11.694 --> 22:12.956
Sometimes Vietnam...

22:18.745 --> 22:19.876
[high pitched noise]

22:20.747 --> 22:24.751
[gasping and coughing]

22:24.794 --> 22:30.321
-Here.
-[exhales]

22:30.365 --> 22:31.453
Thank you.

22:31.497 --> 22:34.151
[crickets chirping outside]

22:34.195 --> 22:35.326
[sighs]

22:35.370 --> 22:37.241
Another nightmare?

22:37.285 --> 22:39.461
[Tess sighs and gulps]

22:39.505 --> 22:41.420
A nightmare

22:41.463 --> 22:43.291
that this was all a nightmare.

22:43.334 --> 22:47.121
[inhales deeply and exhales]

22:49.384 --> 22:50.385
Scotty is here.

22:51.081 --> 22:54.215
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

22:55.216 --> 22:58.959
I wanted you to have Kelley's
personal effects before
they got lost in evidence.

22:59.002 --> 23:00.526
Thank you.

23:00.569 --> 23:03.790
There's also some, uh, documents
you should take a look at.

23:07.184 --> 23:09.883
Tess, uh, no one
could've stopped him.

23:11.275 --> 23:15.105
-What was his mission?
-Uh, it-- it's classified.

23:15.149 --> 23:18.195
-Scotty, what was his mission?
-Tess, I, I can't...

23:18.239 --> 23:21.285
[echoed voice] even begin
to start talking about that.
We're off the deep end here, OK?

23:21.329 --> 23:24.898
It's more than losing my job,
it's-- it's way bigger

23:24.941 --> 23:27.814
than anything I've any
comprehension of right now.

23:28.641 --> 23:29.555
I'm sorry.

23:31.252 --> 23:33.994
[sighs] If there's anything you
need at all, just let me know.

23:34.037 --> 23:35.952
I know that Kelley would do
anything for me, so...

23:35.996 --> 23:39.173
-Thanks, Scotty. Appreciate it.
-Yeah.

23:39.216 --> 23:41.958
[tense music]

23:57.670 --> 24:02.979
[Douglas] They're actually just
detailing rights that they have
that they would like to exercise

24:03.023 --> 24:05.678
before Kelley's
condition deteriorates.

24:05.721 --> 24:07.506
Rights to Kelley?
They don't own Kelley.

24:07.549 --> 24:09.333
Uh, that's correct. They don't.

24:09.377 --> 24:12.728
But, apparently, they do own
the intelligence in his head.

24:12.772 --> 24:15.078
And they would like that
in their possession.

24:15.122 --> 24:17.559
For which they're
willing to compensate you.

24:18.647 --> 24:20.562
Bottom line is they're trying to
buy Kelley?

24:20.606 --> 24:25.088
-In ten thousand words, yes.
-That's not gonna happen.

24:27.743 --> 24:31.268
Okay.
I can delay with an injunction.

24:31.312 --> 24:35.534
But you have
to understand something:
No court of law can stop them,

24:35.577 --> 24:39.276
when it comes to national
security, national security.

24:39.320 --> 24:41.801
So, with that in mind,
I thought it might be
prudent for me to go off

24:41.844 --> 24:46.240
and have a very quiet
conversation with them
about compensation.

24:47.284 --> 24:48.590
Let me be clear:

24:50.244 --> 24:52.463
There is no amount of hush money
that is going to encourage me

24:52.507 --> 24:54.248
to sign over my husband.

24:55.075 --> 24:56.903
I've one piece
of advice for you:

24:58.905 --> 25:02.212
-Take the payoff.
Forget the payback.
-No.

25:04.432 --> 25:05.433
No.

25:05.476 --> 25:08.567
[cacophony of sounds]

25:13.920 --> 25:16.575
[high pitched noise]

25:16.618 --> 25:18.881
[man speaking Spanish]

25:20.230 --> 25:21.928
-Where is this?
-[man speaking Spanish]

25:24.452 --> 25:26.106
[man speaking Spanish]

25:27.934 --> 25:30.240
-[man speaking Spanish]
-Where is this?

25:30.284 --> 25:33.679
You're not in the vault,
the vault is in you.

25:35.332 --> 25:36.986
[cacophony of sounds]

25:41.948 --> 25:43.732
[Kelley groans]

25:51.784 --> 25:53.133
[alarms wail]

25:54.525 --> 25:56.136
I don't where the fuck they are.

25:56.179 --> 25:58.529
Clearly I'm gonna wait here.

25:59.618 --> 26:03.360
[Ah Puch] This is a very
serious question I want you
to really think about.

26:29.517 --> 26:32.694
[dramatic music]

26:32.738 --> 26:36.872
[soldier] Get out of the car!
Get out of the car!
Identify yourself.

26:36.916 --> 26:39.570
-I'm the wife
of Kelley Chandler.
-Stand down, soldier.

26:39.614 --> 26:40.876
Get back in the car.

26:41.660 --> 26:43.313
We're good here. Thank you.

26:43.357 --> 26:45.838
Please. After you.
What the fuck!

26:46.708 --> 26:48.318
Are you fucking kidding me?!

26:50.190 --> 26:53.106
You're a gnat's ass away from
having this conversation
behind bars.

26:53.149 --> 26:55.499
Do you realize that?
Jesus Christ, Tess!

26:55.543 --> 26:58.198
-What the hell are you
trying to accomplish here?
-What is this trying

26:58.241 --> 26:59.765
-to accomplish, Peter.
-I'm following procedure!

26:59.808 --> 27:02.855
Procedure? Don't give me those
company bullshit lines, huh?

27:02.898 --> 27:07.033
I know how they're gonna get
that intelligence and it's gonna
involve killing him. So please.

27:07.076 --> 27:10.340
We need the intelligence.
Kelley is the one that has it.

27:10.384 --> 27:13.779
We've a common interest.
Don't get in our way!

27:13.822 --> 27:17.173
Don't talk to me like I'm
a civilian. I know
this operation, Peter.

27:17.217 --> 27:19.045
I know what goes on
beneath the dirt, okay?

27:19.088 --> 27:21.569
I hate to break it to you, Tess,
but you are a civilian.

27:21.612 --> 27:25.007
And you forget that I know
why they don't let you in the
elevator past the ground floor.

27:25.051 --> 27:28.750
Fuck you, Peter! I need answers!

27:28.794 --> 27:31.927
And if you're not
gonna give them to me,
I know somebody who will.

27:32.798 --> 27:36.192
[car speeds away]

27:39.718 --> 27:41.458
[woman on PA]

27:47.769 --> 27:49.423
I'm getting you out of here.

27:57.431 --> 28:00.434
[phone rings]

28:01.783 --> 28:02.958
Who's this?

28:04.046 --> 28:06.440
[high pitched noise]

28:13.099 --> 28:18.017
[automated voice]
At the French coast the time
will be 8:20. Good night.

28:20.889 --> 28:22.282
[door handle clicking]

28:24.371 --> 28:27.983
[roaring sounds]

28:28.027 --> 28:29.463
[door bangs shut]

28:29.506 --> 28:30.551
[explosive sound]

28:31.770 --> 28:33.119
[groans]

28:34.598 --> 28:36.035
[whirring sounds]

28:38.037 --> 28:44.565
Good god! There's
intelligence scattered
fucking everywhere.

28:48.308 --> 28:54.836
[Goldstucker] If you lose
something of value, you feel afraid, worried, surprised, sad?

28:57.404 --> 28:58.797
Do you need me to do anything?

28:59.667 --> 29:03.932
Help with arrangements?
Make phone calls?

29:03.976 --> 29:05.064
[Amelia] Anything?

29:06.239 --> 29:07.153
Tess?

29:09.155 --> 29:10.330
Is everything okay.

29:14.682 --> 29:18.686
Yeah. I just haven't gotten
any sleep, so I'm exhausted.

29:18.729 --> 29:19.905
What were you doing?

29:21.123 --> 29:22.516
Helping Kelley recover.

29:23.647 --> 29:26.563
-I thought the doctors--
-The doctors don't know shit.

29:27.869 --> 29:29.262
I'm gonna get him out of this.

29:30.002 --> 29:32.439
Yeah. Okay.

29:33.701 --> 29:35.355
[bell tolls]

29:35.398 --> 29:37.357
[tense music]

29:38.227 --> 29:43.015
[helicopter propeller sound]

29:43.058 --> 29:46.018
[bell tolls]

29:47.149 --> 29:48.847
[electronic noise]

29:56.028 --> 29:57.507
Pick up the fucking phone!

29:58.944 --> 30:01.468
This is Agent Chandler...

30:02.251 --> 30:08.779
The first target city
[panting] is Venice.

30:08.823 --> 30:11.913
-[man on phone
speaking Italian]
-Fuck!

30:11.957 --> 30:15.438
We're currently
waiting for clearance.
Uh, I need the executive order.

30:15.482 --> 30:19.399
[clears throat] We've hit
a bit of a snag, but
we will work through it, sir.

30:19.442 --> 30:21.357
Is the intelligence retrievable?

30:25.971 --> 30:27.233
I asked you a question.

30:28.712 --> 30:31.367
-It's not that simple, sir.
-Well, make it simpler.

30:31.411 --> 30:35.241
Can we... extract...
the intelligence?

30:37.069 --> 30:38.157
Well...

30:39.245 --> 30:42.683
That depends
if we're talking about, uh,

30:42.726 --> 30:45.729
full extraction
or an incremental extraction.

30:45.773 --> 30:48.210
We should also determine
whether a pseudo source
is created, so we can--

30:48.254 --> 30:51.953
A pseudo source should
be created? What kind
of bullshit is that, Peter?

30:51.997 --> 30:55.826
A full offline extraction
will kill Agent Chandler, sir.

30:55.870 --> 30:57.828
I know what it'll do
to Agent Chandler.

30:57.872 --> 31:00.266
Do you think Ah Puch is gonna
sit around and take a holiday

31:00.309 --> 31:02.572
while we acknowledge
one of our fallen?

31:02.616 --> 31:03.617
Of course not, sir.

31:05.271 --> 31:06.750
We celebrate different holidays.

31:06.794 --> 31:10.363
[ominous music]

31:28.468 --> 31:32.298
-[Peter shouts out in pain]
-Shush!

31:32.341 --> 31:35.649
-[groaning]
-I got another question for you,
you got any balls there, son?

31:35.692 --> 31:39.305
-Because the future
of your country is at stake.
-[gasps]

31:39.348 --> 31:41.089
Yeah? I'm not gonna
ask you again.

31:44.832 --> 31:47.748
-I'll get the answer.
-Ah, damn right you will.

31:51.447 --> 31:53.972
[helicopter propeller sound]

31:57.149 --> 31:59.064
-Are you okay?
-Fine.

32:00.021 --> 32:02.937
He didn't, uh,
touch you inappropriately
or anything, did he?

32:02.981 --> 32:05.157
What? Really, Scotty?

32:05.200 --> 32:07.115
He's practically blind.

32:07.159 --> 32:09.465
He survived
a bomb attack, they say.

32:09.509 --> 32:12.207
Scares the shit out of me. So...

32:13.948 --> 32:15.297
Uh...

32:15.341 --> 32:17.343
Yeah, uh, don't worry.

32:24.306 --> 32:25.699
[roaring noises]

32:25.742 --> 32:27.527
[high pitched noise]

32:29.050 --> 32:31.487
[intolerable high pitched noise]

32:31.531 --> 32:33.228
[grunting]

32:41.758 --> 32:44.109
[woman on PA]

32:47.460 --> 32:50.332
[Dr. Nelson] I know this is
a really bad time to be here.

32:50.376 --> 32:51.638
How's Kelley doing?

32:54.902 --> 32:56.556
He's... not good.

32:58.819 --> 32:59.776
How are you doing?

32:59.820 --> 33:01.735
[suspenseful music]

33:03.215 --> 33:05.043
I need to access him...

33:09.917 --> 33:12.311
[whimsical music]

33:13.442 --> 33:14.704
To bring him back.

33:15.749 --> 33:17.838
Please tell me you're
taking your medication?

33:20.797 --> 33:24.236
Tess, I'm-- I'm worried
about your mental health.

33:24.279 --> 33:26.760
Given your prior history
with this operation.

33:27.935 --> 33:32.548
[Kelley] She's experiencing side-effects. She's disoriented for the most part.

33:32.592 --> 33:35.638
Physical symptoms are
nausea and loss of appetite.

33:36.465 --> 33:39.338
Any indication
on what may have occurred?

33:39.381 --> 33:41.688
No. It's under investigation.

33:41.731 --> 33:43.907
Look, Kelley,
they will stop at nothing

33:43.951 --> 33:46.910
to cripple you
and corrupt the intelligence.

33:46.954 --> 33:48.260
You're aware of that?

33:49.652 --> 33:51.785
You think the intelligence
was corrupted?

33:53.569 --> 33:58.922
Welcome to Nano-terrorism...

34:05.146 --> 34:07.279
Can we retrieve
the intelligence?

34:08.670 --> 34:11.370
That's an intriguing question.

34:11.413 --> 34:15.635
I don't think...
that it's possible to do

34:15.678 --> 34:19.291
without examining the current
condition of the hardware.

34:19.333 --> 34:21.248
Well, at this point,
I don't think that's possible.

34:21.293 --> 34:23.686
The agent isn't
in our possession.

34:23.730 --> 34:28.126
If he's in a hospital,
it's very possible.

34:30.780 --> 34:32.130
[woman on PA]

34:32.172 --> 34:35.916
Wow.
These invitations are beautiful.

34:35.958 --> 34:37.222
[Amelia] For a... birthday.

34:37.264 --> 34:38.875
-Something wrong?
-I'm just...

34:39.614 --> 34:41.574
wondering who you're
gonna invite.

34:43.010 --> 34:44.315
Kelley's friends.

34:45.186 --> 34:46.360
Our family.

34:47.362 --> 34:48.536
[Tess] The C.I.A.

34:49.408 --> 34:51.801
[Au Puch] Jerry.

34:51.844 --> 34:53.324
Jerry.

34:53.368 --> 34:55.675
Oh, ho-ho, Jerry.

35:01.028 --> 35:02.334
Place the card.

35:04.510 --> 35:06.729
[whimsical music]

35:17.523 --> 35:21.614
[Goldstucker]
It will be impossible
to gain access to the vault,

35:22.919 --> 35:24.094
without a code.

35:24.138 --> 35:26.358
[roaring sounds]

35:30.275 --> 35:33.539
[Goldstucker] We have engineered
an automatic locking system

35:33.582 --> 35:36.194
that will allow
optimum protection.

35:36.237 --> 35:38.979
A key-code created by you,

35:40.676 --> 35:45.203
and only known by you,
will allow access.

35:46.247 --> 35:49.207
Even with the use
of brute force,

35:49.250 --> 35:52.210
one would only compromise it.

35:52.253 --> 35:54.690
[?] Volunteer the intelligence.

35:54.734 --> 35:57.345
One could never gain access.

35:57.389 --> 36:02.698
So, the key-code will be
stored outside the vault.

36:02.742 --> 36:04.265
And where would that be,
exactly?

36:05.266 --> 36:09.357
-Hum. Close your eyes.

37:23.301 --> 37:25.303
[Kelley] Tess. Listen to me...

37:25.346 --> 37:27.783
This is a secret
you cannot hide.

37:27.827 --> 37:29.394
I saw what happened.

37:31.439 --> 37:34.703
Whatever you got
going on in there,
it's not fucking worth it.

37:38.664 --> 37:40.535
Dump it, and get out.

37:46.324 --> 37:51.807
Dump it. I don't care about you.

37:51.851 --> 37:54.941
[Goldstucker] It upsets you
to see an animal in pain?

37:57.117 --> 38:02.035
The wife?
The wife is attempting
to get the intelligence?

38:04.385 --> 38:07.083
Tess is looking for answers.

38:07.127 --> 38:08.520
Oh, tough shit.

38:10.130 --> 38:13.002
Her emotions are getting
the best of her... again.

38:14.526 --> 38:17.920
You better not let her emotions
get the best of you, Peter.

38:20.096 --> 38:21.794
I'll handle it.

38:26.102 --> 38:27.887
[sighs] The wife.

38:29.541 --> 38:32.152
That's all I need,
is another wife...

39:54.495 --> 39:59.457
Good god... these black spots
appear to be an abnormality.

39:59.500 --> 40:01.241
I think it's shifts of power.

40:01.284 --> 40:03.504
They appear
to be slowly evolving.

40:03.548 --> 40:06.246
-[man] Is there a specific
location or area?
-Fuck.

40:06.289 --> 40:11.251
In and around the areas where...
intelligence can be located.

40:11.294 --> 40:14.820
-They're fucking
feeding off of it.
-[man] Fascinating.

40:15.777 --> 40:18.998
[Kelley] Target cities
seem to be mounting.

40:19.041 --> 40:21.174
It's unclear how they're
gonna execute the plan.

40:21.217 --> 40:23.045
So I don't know
if it's meaningless

40:23.089 --> 40:25.483
or if it's gonna
save millions of lives.

40:25.526 --> 40:26.875
But someone's gonna die.

40:27.746 --> 40:30.836
Me... or millions of people.

42:18.421 --> 42:19.335
Get down!

42:20.293 --> 42:21.250
Call me Tits.

42:22.730 --> 42:26.386
My real name is Robert,
but everyone calls me Tits.

42:27.169 --> 42:30.651
You know, Robert,
Bob, Bobby, Boobs...

42:30.695 --> 42:33.175
Boobs... Then they started
calling me Tits.

42:33.219 --> 42:35.613
Now everyone calls me Tits.
You can call me Tits.

42:35.656 --> 42:37.266
Tell me where we're going.

42:39.181 --> 42:43.664
-This is a place where...
-Does anyone really
know where we're going?

42:43.708 --> 42:45.405
That's a question I always ask.

42:49.583 --> 42:52.020
It's your birthday. Yeah,
we'll get you there, pal.

42:53.500 --> 42:54.719
This is crazy.

42:55.676 --> 42:57.112
Happy birthday, sweetie.

43:01.334 --> 43:03.945
I think you got
a lot going on up there.
Anything you wanna talk about?

43:03.989 --> 43:07.427
Listen, I know I'm
just the getaway driver,
I'm not supposed to get involved

43:07.470 --> 43:10.909

swimming in a sea of some

43:16.871 --> 43:18.394
I got some aspirin
in the glove compartment.

43:18.438 --> 43:22.398
How the hell do you get
Dick out of Richard?

43:22.442 --> 43:25.445
You come up...
You, Richard. Bob. Dick.

43:25.488 --> 43:28.448
-Call me Tits.
-Oh, don't take this
the wrong way,

43:28.491 --> 43:30.929
just get me

a moment, please? Hi.

-What are you doing?
-Throwing Kelley
a birthday party.

44:55.317 --> 44:58.016
-You're fucking
with the process.
-Yeah?

44:58.059 --> 44:59.800
What exactly is
the fucking process, huh?

44:59.844 --> 45:03.021
-You know I can't tell you that.
-Real talk. It's me.

45:03.064 --> 45:07.112
-Times have changed.
-I think I above everybody else
deserve to know.

45:07.155 --> 45:10.942
You, above everybody else,
know that this is classified
information.

45:10.985 --> 45:14.423
Go home. Take a shower.
Have a hot meal.

45:14.467 --> 45:18.036

they will be able to...

45:48.631 --> 45:51.417
Keep it together.
OK? Keep it together.

45:52.461 --> 45:53.549
They can't.

45:55.160 --> 45:57.510
They don't have
the technology for that.

because I care.

46:17.008 --> 46:18.531
I overheard the guests talking.

46:21.664 --> 46:24.232
They thought
that this party was...

46:25.930 --> 46:27.496
slightly demented.

46:28.671 --> 46:29.629
And, maybe...

to lose it again.

55:17.112 --> 55:19.376
-I'm looking for
Kelley Chandler.
-He was transferred

55:19.419 --> 55:21.595
-at 7:00 a.m. this morning.
-Transferred? What are you
talking about,

55:21.639 --> 55:23.815
transferred?
Transferred to where?

55:23.858 --> 55:26.208
-Location... Saint Johns.
-Come on, come on.

55:26.252 --> 55:29.647
-Saint Johns?
-It's a long-term care facility.

55:34.303 --> 55:36.958
[truck honking]

55:44.444 --> 55:47.447
[truck honking]

55:48.753 --> 55:51.059
[ominous music]

56:00.286 --> 56:03.245
Do you know
the history of this agent?

56:03.289 --> 56:07.467
Additional images will allow us
to see in greater detail

56:07.511 --> 56:09.991
what may be causing
this abnormality.

56:10.035 --> 56:12.254
May I suggest further testing?

56:12.298 --> 56:15.257
[Peter]
Thank you. We're finished.

56:15.301 --> 56:19.174
Six, seven, eight, nine,
ten target cities.

56:19.218 --> 56:20.437
Uh, you missed two.

56:21.220 --> 56:24.615
-Your calls, guy.
-Twelve cities. Twelve bombs.

56:25.311 --> 56:29.924
-Jesus Christ.
-12-12 is the file name
we keep coming across.

56:31.099 --> 56:34.668
Then, uh, we have some clearer
images that we could analyze,

56:34.712 --> 56:39.281
but for the most part,
the intelligence
is completely corrupted

56:39.325 --> 56:40.674
and continues to deteriorate.

56:42.981 --> 56:46.288
-What you're watching here is
the brain slowly dying.
-What I always wanted to watch.

56:46.332 --> 56:48.856
Is the intelligence
fully retrievable?

56:48.900 --> 56:52.294
I would highly recommend
not removing any intelligence.

56:52.338 --> 56:55.733
-And why is that?
-The ratio of success
is very low.

56:56.777 --> 56:59.301
[Dr. A]
It's no different than, uh,
if your hard drive crashed.

56:59.345 --> 57:02.174
It's extremely difficult
to remove the data.

57:03.131 --> 57:04.176
We could try,

57:05.525 --> 57:07.658
but we would destroy our agent
in the process.

57:08.920 --> 57:14.534
Oh, well, your
recommendation is duly noted.

57:14.578 --> 57:16.275
-[Hotchkiss] Let's get
on with it.
-[Peter] Sir, he said

57:16.318 --> 57:19.539
the chances are low.
We have an obligation

57:19.583 --> 57:21.889
-to do whatever it takes
to save our agent--
-Let me explain something

57:21.933 --> 57:24.588
to you, Peter. If agent Kelley
was alive here today,

57:24.631 --> 57:28.461
he would be the first one
to order it's retrieval,
at any cost!

57:28.505 --> 57:30.768
'Cause that was the risk
he was prepared to take

57:30.811 --> 57:32.204
when he accepted
this assignment.

57:32.247 --> 57:34.206
-Ain't that right, Scotty?
-Yeah.

57:34.249 --> 57:36.382
Yeah.
And that's why he was chosen!

57:36.425 --> 57:38.993
He took on this assignment under
the protection of this agency.

57:39.037 --> 57:42.823
-And now you're failing
to protect him!
-We're at war, son!

57:42.867 --> 57:44.825
And there are casualties!

57:44.869 --> 57:46.914
Now, keep your fucking eye
on the ball!

57:49.221 --> 57:53.312
Scotty, keep an eye on him.
I'll take a leak.

58:15.813 --> 58:17.728
[background chatter]

58:18.467 --> 58:19.860
I'm looking for Kelley Chandler.

58:19.904 --> 58:22.733
-Room 305. Third floor.
-Thank you.

58:24.256 --> 58:26.127
[respirator hissing]

58:28.303 --> 58:29.304
Honey.

58:31.785 --> 58:34.266
I swear I'm gonna kill
that son of a bitch.

58:36.007 --> 58:37.878
What did they do to you?

58:42.709 --> 58:44.537
[phone rings]

58:44.581 --> 58:47.584
-What are you guys doing to him?
-You think I have a choice?

58:47.627 --> 58:50.412
-I am stuck
in the crossfire here, Tess.
-Then take a side, Peter,

58:50.456 --> 58:52.458
because he's gonna die
in a place like this.

58:52.501 --> 58:55.069
Well, frankly, at this point
I think that's the idea.

58:55.113 --> 58:57.724
-You fucking asshole!
-Hey! Listen to me!

58:57.768 --> 58:59.813
This is about
what is in his head.

58:59.857 --> 59:02.250
The intelligence is there
and it is retrievable.

59:02.294 --> 59:06.690
The problem is
we do not have the time.
Hotchkiss wants it yesterday.

59:06.733 --> 59:08.474
I wanna speak to Goldstucker.

59:08.517 --> 59:11.825
Are you fucking crazy?
Goldstucker lives off the grid.

59:11.869 --> 59:15.612
You're not listening to me. You
have to accept the reality
of the situation here.

59:16.656 --> 59:18.310
What does 12-12 mean to you?

59:20.268 --> 59:23.358
-Where did you hear that?
-Like I said:
I want to speak to Goldstucker.

59:24.316 --> 59:26.361
[woman on PA]

59:30.148 --> 59:32.803
[Goldstucker] I want you
to imagine the desert.

59:32.846 --> 59:35.675
The sand. The Sun. The heat.

59:35.719 --> 59:37.895
The wind that gets in your face.

59:37.938 --> 59:39.461
Open your eyes.

59:39.505 --> 59:43.901
While I was speaking,
you did see an image.

59:44.989 --> 59:48.035
-Correct.
-Where is that image?

59:48.079 --> 59:53.040
The image of that desert is
in your imagination.

59:54.476 --> 59:59.090
Call it consciousness.
Trans-personal consciousness.

59:59.133 --> 01:00:04.661
For hundreds of years poets,
philosophers, scientists

01:00:04.704 --> 01:00:06.010
artists, you name it,

01:00:07.794 --> 01:00:11.319
have been searching for it,
without ever locating it.

01:00:11.363 --> 01:00:15.280
That is
where we store your key-code.

01:00:18.544 --> 01:00:21.286
In your consciousness.

01:00:25.072 --> 01:00:28.119
Here you go. Goldfinger's
contact as requested.

01:00:29.555 --> 01:00:32.340
-It's Goldstucker.
-Yeah, whatever. Goldpecker.

01:00:32.384 --> 01:00:34.995
This dude was a bitch to find.
Be careful paying him a visit.

01:00:35.039 --> 01:00:37.215
I don't think
he wants to be found.

01:00:51.751 --> 01:00:54.972
Don't thank me now.
But I'm not even going to ask

01:00:55.015 --> 01:00:58.192
how you obtained
classified information
that only Kelley could have.

01:00:58.932 --> 01:01:04.198
But if anyone
even wonders if you're
tampering with evidence,

01:01:04.242 --> 01:01:06.505
I cannot help you.
Do you understand me?

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:09.334
Yes.

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:14.731
I can't say he'll exactly
be thrilled to talk to you.

01:01:15.601 --> 01:01:18.778
He wasn't too happy
that our people were
looking for him.

01:01:18.822 --> 01:01:20.258
So, you guys are gonna kill him?

01:01:21.085 --> 01:01:22.477
I never said that.

01:01:28.092 --> 01:01:30.311
-[dialing tone]
-[operator in Spanish]

01:01:33.837 --> 01:01:35.316
[high pitched noise]

01:01:37.057 --> 01:01:38.102
[busy tone]

01:01:39.843 --> 01:01:41.409
-Watch him?
-Look, you can text,
talk, do whatever you like.

01:01:41.453 --> 01:01:43.411
-Just don't leave that room, OK?
-This is the part

01:01:43.455 --> 01:01:45.587
where I try to talk
some sense into you.

01:01:45.631 --> 01:01:48.373
I'm not gonna lie,
this is frickin' strange.

01:01:48.416 --> 01:01:52.638
I moved to this god-forsaken
shit pit, 'cause Mom and Dad
wanted me to help you.

01:01:52.681 --> 01:01:54.422
We just went beyond that.

01:01:54.466 --> 01:01:56.555
I understand watching your cat
when you go on vacay, but--

01:01:56.598 --> 01:01:59.558
-I don't trust anybody, OK?
-No, no, no...

01:01:59.601 --> 01:02:02.082
Don't you leave that room.
Not even for five minutes.

01:02:02.126 --> 01:02:04.955
-That's why they have nurses.
-There's protection
under the bed.

01:02:04.998 --> 01:02:08.785
-Protection?
-Fourteen rounds in the clip,
one in the chamber.

01:02:08.828 --> 01:02:10.961
[monitor beeping]

01:03:02.012 --> 01:03:06.190
[GPS giving directions]

01:03:17.897 --> 01:03:20.334
[radio playing music]

01:03:25.905 --> 01:03:28.038
[loud blast]

01:03:29.909 --> 01:03:31.171
[dramatic music]

01:03:49.929 --> 01:03:51.278
[grunting]

01:03:54.455 --> 01:03:55.587
[groans]

01:04:08.252 --> 01:04:10.950
Can I, uh, help you here, ma'am?

01:04:10.994 --> 01:04:13.648
Boy, these cars, they don't do
good in the heat, do they.

01:04:15.955 --> 01:04:17.826
-[thud]
-[groaning]

01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:21.395
-Argh! Jesus! Fuck me!
-Tell them they're
getting sloppy.

01:04:21.439 --> 01:04:25.008
Who? I'm sorry, ma'am.
I want no business with you.

01:04:25.051 --> 01:04:27.184
The God honest truth. Argh!

01:04:27.227 --> 01:04:28.576
[gasping & coughing]

01:04:34.626 --> 01:04:35.540
Fuck.

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.108
[panting] Keep it together.

01:04:40.284 --> 01:04:41.459
-[man] What's going on?
-[Amelia] I'm really
worried about Tess.

01:04:41.502 --> 01:04:43.374
-She's acting crazy.
-[man] Oh, great.

01:04:43.417 --> 01:04:45.637
OK, I can't do this on my own
anymore. I need your help.

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:47.204
[man] I'm gonna call
Mom and Dad.

01:04:53.123 --> 01:04:55.255
-[man] Was she detained?
-Okay.

01:04:55.299 --> 01:04:57.257
-She got away.
-How the fuck did that happen?

01:04:57.301 --> 01:04:58.737
Because she's good!

01:04:59.956 --> 01:05:05.309
She's real good. Shit.

01:05:05.352 --> 01:05:08.660
Let's begin.
Six characters and numbers.

01:05:10.836 --> 01:05:12.577
Twenty-two.

01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:13.970
Color.

01:05:14.927 --> 01:05:15.972
Black.

01:05:16.798 --> 01:05:18.713
Imagine a name.

01:05:18.757 --> 01:05:20.977
Contessa Ford.

01:05:21.803 --> 01:05:22.674
An action or emotion.

01:05:23.370 --> 01:05:24.676
Running.

01:05:24.719 --> 01:05:26.547
A specific place.

01:05:26.591 --> 01:05:28.506
Tulum, Mexico.

01:05:29.289 --> 01:05:34.251
That will be your key-code.
Those images will unlock
the vault.

01:05:37.558 --> 01:05:38.995
[crow cawing]

01:06:05.717 --> 01:06:10.026
[suspenseful music]

01:06:28.479 --> 01:06:31.482
[suspenseful music]

01:06:57.856 --> 01:06:59.205
[gun being cocked]

01:07:00.989 --> 01:07:02.208
[high pitched noise]

01:07:26.754 --> 01:07:30.018
[Kelley] They're targeting
stadiums. Shopping centers.

01:07:30.062 --> 01:07:33.109
Parks. Fairgrounds.
Mass Transit. Trains.

01:07:34.153 --> 01:07:35.328
Buses.

01:07:36.721 --> 01:07:37.809
Rental cars.

01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:41.291
I know it's not
my business, but...

01:07:45.686 --> 01:07:47.471
I'm here to talk about Kelley.

01:07:47.514 --> 01:07:48.907
He's in a coma.

01:07:52.998 --> 01:07:54.217
And?

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.480
And I need your help.

01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:59.352
[chuckles]

01:07:59.396 --> 01:08:01.659
It's not the reaction
I was hoping for.

01:08:03.313 --> 01:08:04.444
I'm sorry.

01:08:08.187 --> 01:08:12.148
But you're telling me
our safety measures worked.

01:08:13.236 --> 01:08:14.454
Under stress...

01:08:16.716 --> 01:08:19.938
the safe was supposed
to lock automatically.

01:08:21.157 --> 01:08:22.287
It did!

01:08:22.332 --> 01:08:23.724
And you could unlock it?

01:08:25.551 --> 01:08:28.163
Just how incapacitated is he?

01:08:28.207 --> 01:08:29.991
He's receiving some codes.

01:08:30.035 --> 01:08:33.037
-Do you have access
to his key code?
-Key code?

01:08:33.952 --> 01:08:37.912
-The key code was
your only chance.
-And how hard is it to hack it?

01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:40.654
I would say it's impossible...

01:08:42.482 --> 01:08:44.005
if you weren't his wife.

01:08:45.093 --> 01:08:50.490
The code is based on M.R.S.
Memory Retrieval Stimulation.

01:08:52.536 --> 01:08:54.277
A positive memory...

01:08:55.886 --> 01:09:00.108
stimulates the release of
the neurotransmitter dopamine.

01:09:00.152 --> 01:09:06.506
The key code is
a simple sequence of
six characters or phrase

01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:09.901
that acts as
just such a release.

01:09:12.295 --> 01:09:14.948
Allowing the safe

01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:18.214
to unlock.

01:09:19.345 --> 01:09:21.912
Spontaneously.
[in foreign language]

01:09:24.307 --> 01:09:26.221
So, what exactly
am I'm looking for?

01:09:28.093 --> 01:09:29.006
Images.

01:09:30.835 --> 01:09:32.576
Music. Books.

01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:37.929
Love letters.

01:09:39.930 --> 01:09:40.975
Sounds simple.

01:09:42.281 --> 01:09:43.412
It isn't.

01:09:46.938 --> 01:09:48.505
And it is.

01:10:17.055 --> 01:10:18.274
[groans]

01:10:21.102 --> 01:10:23.583
[dramatic music]

01:10:49.392 --> 01:10:51.394
[high pitched noise]

01:10:52.830 --> 01:10:54.571
[Tits] What the hell, man?

01:10:54.614 --> 01:10:57.530
Hey. Anyway,
I got you something.

01:10:59.489 --> 01:11:01.578
It's chock full
of hollow points.

01:11:01.621 --> 01:11:03.406
Don't be afraid to use it, OK?

01:11:06.365 --> 01:11:10.587
Hey, hey! Oh, Jesus! Whoa! Whoa!
No, no! Get away from me!

01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:14.242
-I have hotel surveillance.
-I look forward
to reading your report.

01:11:14.286 --> 01:11:15.809
You're not going to watch it?

01:11:15.853 --> 01:11:18.377
I know the ending.
He dies in a coma.

01:11:18.421 --> 01:11:21.206
-But there could be something--
-I don't know about you, Scotty,

01:11:21.249 --> 01:11:24.992
but I don't get off
watching my friends get
their ass handed to them.

01:11:28.387 --> 01:11:29.867
For the record, neither do I.

01:11:31.956 --> 01:11:33.740
[voice on PA]
Agent Noah, please report
to intelligence retrieval.

01:11:41.966 --> 01:11:43.054
I love you.

01:11:46.362 --> 01:11:47.493
[Dr. Nelson] Good morning, Tess.

01:11:52.324 --> 01:11:56.154
You are probably wondering
what we're all doing
in your living room.

01:11:57.155 --> 01:11:59.070
Well, it looks
like an intervention.

01:12:01.464 --> 01:12:02.378
Are you behind this?

01:12:03.988 --> 01:12:07.165
Amelia was involved in this
because she's worried about you.

01:12:08.253 --> 01:12:10.081
They're all here
because they love you.

01:12:12.126 --> 01:12:13.693
So, please...

01:12:14.738 --> 01:12:16.522
They just want you
to hear them out.

01:12:19.482 --> 01:12:21.092
The donuts are a nice touch.

01:12:22.093 --> 01:12:26.227
Hey! Whoa! No, no, no, no!
Let me go. They're not dead!

01:12:26.271 --> 01:12:28.534
I forgot [indistinct]

01:12:29.753 --> 01:12:33.104
It's me, Tits, Tits.
Tits! Get off of me.

01:12:33.147 --> 01:12:37.978
-Are you real?
-Real? Real what?
I'm real fucking scared!

01:12:38.022 --> 01:12:40.981
It's Tits. That's right.
It's tits.

01:12:41.765 --> 01:12:43.549
You wanna touch Tits? Go ahead.

01:12:43.593 --> 01:12:44.724
-Who, who am I?
-Yeah.

01:12:44.768 --> 01:12:46.117
Are you kidding? Come on.

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.684
See. I'm real.

01:12:50.817 --> 01:12:52.515
[gunshot and glass shattering]

01:12:54.212 --> 01:12:58.564
-[people shouting]
-[sirens wailing]

01:13:23.197 --> 01:13:24.590
[tires squealing]

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:43.914
[grunts]

01:13:50.877 --> 01:13:54.228
Honey...
it's time to let him go.

01:13:54.272 --> 01:13:58.494
We'll help you through it
any way we possibly can.
You have to know that.

01:13:58.537 --> 01:14:00.017
What's life's support if...

01:14:00.757 --> 01:14:02.628
if there's no life to support?

01:14:02.672 --> 01:14:07.851
You know I love you. I'm no
expert on death but I think...

01:14:07.894 --> 01:14:12.159
Tommy... I love you.
If you're about to give me

01:14:12.203 --> 01:14:16.294
the Circle of Lifespeech,
I will gut you with a pencil.

01:14:16.337 --> 01:14:18.296
-Tess...
-[Douglas] Look,

01:14:18.339 --> 01:14:21.386
I think it's fair
that you know, that the CIA

01:14:21.429 --> 01:14:24.824
is thinking about filing
federal tampering charges.

01:14:25.738 --> 01:14:27.087
It's a scare tactic.

01:14:27.914 --> 01:14:29.916
I don't think so. OK?

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:32.005
I think you have mightily
pissed these people off.

01:14:32.049 --> 01:14:34.051
They're sick
and fucking tired of you.

01:14:34.094 --> 01:14:35.792
And you are directly
in their crosshairs.

01:14:36.706 --> 01:14:39.099
They're gonna have to kill me,
if they want to kill him.

01:14:39.143 --> 01:14:47.630
Well, I'll be sure
to let them know that.

01:14:47.673 --> 01:14:50.981
Why are they paying us
to talk to you?

01:14:52.591 --> 01:14:53.940
Say that again?

01:14:53.984 --> 01:14:56.552
Why are they
paying us to talk to you?

01:14:58.641 --> 01:15:02.383
[Kelley] Wait, wait...
I want to ask you something.

01:15:02.427 --> 01:15:06.126
Wait, wait.
Come here. I care about you.

01:15:10.261 --> 01:15:11.218
Tess?

01:15:11.262 --> 01:15:12.568
What did they offer you?

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:18.617
You all claim to be his friends,
his family. Huh?

01:15:19.662 --> 01:15:20.924
So, how much was it?

01:15:22.012 --> 01:15:23.579
One million dollars?

01:15:24.449 --> 01:15:26.364
Five? Ten?

01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:29.585
Anybody?

01:15:31.456 --> 01:15:33.371
Nothing? You guys have nothing?

01:15:34.111 --> 01:15:39.159
I just wanna let you know,
that I'm not gonna let
any of you cash him in.

01:15:40.770 --> 01:15:44.730
[loud electronic noises]

01:16:03.009 --> 01:16:04.837
He's gone ape shit.

01:16:07.666 --> 01:16:09.712
-[gunshot]
-Ow!

01:16:12.018 --> 01:16:14.412
No, you're not supposed
to shoot me.

01:16:14.455 --> 01:16:16.980
[groaning]

01:16:21.201 --> 01:16:23.421
-[gunshot]
-[cars honking]

01:16:26.816 --> 01:16:27.904
[grunts]

01:16:32.343 --> 01:16:35.346
[dramatic music]

01:16:42.745 --> 01:16:43.833
[grunts]

01:17:05.028 --> 01:17:07.683
[violent sound effects]

01:17:12.383 --> 01:17:14.211
-[woman on PA]
-[machine beeping]

01:17:21.958 --> 01:17:25.265
Today could be the day, right?

01:17:25.309 --> 01:17:26.266
Come on, sweetie.

01:17:31.445 --> 01:17:34.057
[violent sound effects]

01:17:37.408 --> 01:17:38.322
Beach.

01:17:40.759 --> 01:17:42.326
Because there's not much time.

01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:45.198
Twenty-two.

01:17:47.853 --> 01:17:50.421
[violent sound effects]

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:55.078
Red.

01:17:59.343 --> 01:18:00.518
Twenty-two.

01:18:15.272 --> 01:18:16.229
Sunset.

01:18:18.841 --> 01:18:20.016
[cars honking]

01:18:21.931 --> 01:18:23.193
Come on, sweetie.

01:18:26.544 --> 01:18:27.458
[grunts]

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:29.895
[siren wailing]

01:18:29.939 --> 01:18:31.244
[seagull squawking]

01:18:32.811 --> 01:18:33.943
Red.

01:18:39.905 --> 01:18:40.993
Come on.

01:18:47.913 --> 01:18:49.001
Twenty-two.

01:18:52.962 --> 01:18:55.660
[dramatic music]

01:18:55.703 --> 01:18:59.055
[electronic buzz]

01:19:05.148 --> 01:19:10.457
I'm following
concerning the health
and well-being of Tess.

01:19:13.939 --> 01:19:15.027
Thank you.

01:19:17.595 --> 01:19:19.553
[tense music]

01:19:21.599 --> 01:19:23.166
[beeping Morse code]

01:19:23.209 --> 01:19:24.950
Kelley, listen to me!

01:19:25.951 --> 01:19:27.300
Come on!

01:19:34.873 --> 01:19:36.744
-[phone ringing]
-[officer] You're under arrest

01:19:36.788 --> 01:19:38.529
for tampering with
federal evidence.

01:19:53.849 --> 01:19:54.937
[Tess grunts]

01:20:12.868 --> 01:20:14.521
Get out! Get off me!

01:20:14.565 --> 01:20:17.002
[panting]

01:20:17.046 --> 01:20:20.353
If he even had
the slightest chance
I wouldn't have let this happen.

01:20:22.007 --> 01:20:23.922
You left us
no other choice, Tess.

01:20:23.966 --> 01:20:26.620
Choices. There were choices.

01:20:26.664 --> 01:20:29.710
You have to trust me.
I'm protecting you.

01:20:29.754 --> 01:20:32.931
No. You're trying
to protect yourself.

01:20:33.976 --> 01:20:35.064
[scoffs]

01:20:47.293 --> 01:20:48.686
What's gonna happen now?

01:20:49.643 --> 01:20:52.081
She'll undergo
psychiatric evaluation.

01:20:53.125 --> 01:20:55.606
Depending on the outcome

01:20:56.433 --> 01:21:01.003
the hospital can legally hold
her for the next 48 hours.
So, she's safe.

01:21:04.093 --> 01:21:06.617
-Thank you.
-God bless you.

01:21:10.926 --> 01:21:13.102
[waves breaking]

01:21:22.198 --> 01:21:24.591
[Goldstucker]
This completes the evaluation.

01:21:28.334 --> 01:21:31.250
Her past.
Your present. The future.

01:21:31.294 --> 01:21:33.252
It has no place.
She doesn't know where she's at.

01:21:33.296 --> 01:21:37.430
She must remove
the intelligence immediately.

01:21:38.127 --> 01:21:39.737
There must have been a breach.

01:21:40.738 --> 01:21:42.479
A breach in her logic.

01:21:45.221 --> 01:21:47.005
She's not going in.
She's paranoid.

01:21:47.049 --> 01:21:49.965
She wakes up every day thinking
the world is going to end.

01:21:50.008 --> 01:21:55.405
Until she removes
the intelligence,
she may never recover.

01:21:57.755 --> 01:22:01.106
You believe that you were
communicating with your husband

01:22:01.150 --> 01:22:03.543
through the use of Morse code.

01:22:04.762 --> 01:22:07.025
You wanna tell me
about that conversation?

01:22:08.853 --> 01:22:12.509
Kelley is currently
holding intelligence
detailing 12 nuclear bombs

01:22:12.552 --> 01:22:14.685
destined for
12 different countries.

01:22:14.728 --> 01:22:17.993
But, unfortunately,
he's been infected by a virus.

01:22:18.906 --> 01:22:20.778
Wow. Okay. Uhm...

01:22:21.648 --> 01:22:25.217
Is this the same virus we were
talking about 18 months ago?

01:22:25.261 --> 01:22:27.393
The one that gave me
nightmares, yes.

01:22:33.965 --> 01:22:35.227
Do you think I'm insane?

01:22:36.924 --> 01:22:38.491
I didn't say that.

01:22:38.535 --> 01:22:39.405
Ah.

01:22:44.976 --> 01:22:49.198
Doctor Nelson is recommending
that you stay here
indefinitely, Tess.

01:22:52.114 --> 01:22:55.595
You know, next time, you may
want to leave out the bullshit

01:22:55.639 --> 01:22:59.208
about the 12 bombs
and the virus.

01:23:00.992 --> 01:23:02.559
Bring on the medication.

01:23:04.126 --> 01:23:07.912
The only medicine you need
right now, is the fucking truth.

01:23:07.955 --> 01:23:10.871
And the sooner you swallow it,
the sooner you'll realize

01:23:10.915 --> 01:23:14.440
this whole little fucking
seance of yours is over.

01:23:14.484 --> 01:23:16.486
-It's not over.
-Oh, really?

01:23:17.269 --> 01:23:22.753
Do you see yourself getting out
of here anytime soon? Do you?
'Cause I don't.

01:23:22.796 --> 01:23:25.364
You were lucky
that you got out the last time.

01:23:25.408 --> 01:23:27.062
Kelley got me out last time.

01:23:28.063 --> 01:23:29.412
OK. [clears throat]

01:23:32.763 --> 01:23:33.633
Guess what.

01:23:35.548 --> 01:23:40.075
Kelley is not
getting you out of here.

01:23:40.118 --> 01:23:44.166
This is getting you out of here.

01:23:44.209 --> 01:23:46.429
Kelley can't save you.

01:23:47.343 --> 01:23:49.258
So, wake the fuck up.

01:23:53.871 --> 01:23:54.915
[man] It was meant to be.

01:23:56.308 --> 01:23:57.788
It'll be just
what you want it to be.

01:23:59.485 --> 01:24:01.008
Look for the light.

01:24:01.835 --> 01:24:03.881
Do your rights
in the name of the Lord.

01:24:06.797 --> 01:24:11.715
As it is said, for ever
and ever. And never, ever.

01:24:29.036 --> 01:24:30.429
Hmm.

01:24:30.473 --> 01:24:32.649
Boy, you are
a sight for sore eyes.

01:24:35.695 --> 01:24:37.132
Why are you so upset with me?

01:24:37.871 --> 01:24:39.525
I didn't put you in here,
you did.

01:24:39.569 --> 01:24:41.179
Why don't you just
leave Kelley alone?

01:24:41.223 --> 01:24:43.181
I'm not sure if, uh,

01:24:43.225 --> 01:24:46.053
those are the kind
of questions I'd be
asking if I were you.

01:24:46.097 --> 01:24:50.188
I'd be asking myself,
uh, why am I still alive.
Why I haven't been killed.

01:24:50.232 --> 01:24:53.626
Why I haven't pulled the plug
on Kelley when he arrived.

01:24:53.670 --> 01:24:56.760
Those are the kind of questions
I'd be asking if I were you,
and I'll tell you why.

01:24:56.803 --> 01:24:59.589
Because me and you,
we have the same goal.

01:24:59.632 --> 01:25:02.331
-No, we don't.
-Oh, yes we do, young lady!

01:25:03.114 --> 01:25:05.899
We just have maybe
a different approach to it.

01:25:07.292 --> 01:25:10.861
Begging by his bedside
just isn't my style,
if you know what I mean.

01:25:11.557 --> 01:25:16.475
Although I have heard now that
you've had some positive results
and I want to hear about them.

01:25:17.650 --> 01:25:20.305
So, while I'm far from begging,

01:25:20.349 --> 01:25:22.655
I am prepared
to sit by your bedside.

01:25:27.834 --> 01:25:29.184
[Hotchkiss grunts]

01:25:30.576 --> 01:25:32.404
-Don't touch me!
-Oh, sorry.

01:25:33.318 --> 01:25:34.928
I put my hand on your toes?

01:25:35.886 --> 01:25:37.844
You know I can't see very well.

01:25:45.417 --> 01:25:49.334
-What can you tell me?
-Nothing.

01:25:49.378 --> 01:25:52.468
You have intelligence
that'll save millions
of lives, young lady.

01:25:52.511 --> 01:25:54.383
You better tell me something.

01:25:55.166 --> 01:25:56.733
I only care about one.

01:25:58.909 --> 01:26:04.219
Careful, I might have lost
most of my sight but I've not
lost my sense of smell.

01:26:12.314 --> 01:26:14.316
You're beginning to rot.

01:26:15.142 --> 01:26:16.231
Leave.

01:26:23.977 --> 01:26:26.806
It was truly lovely
to see you again, Spider.

01:26:29.418 --> 01:26:31.289
Really lovely.

01:26:32.247 --> 01:26:33.552
[click]

01:26:33.596 --> 01:26:35.380
You can't keep hiding.

01:26:36.425 --> 01:26:39.254
Dump it. Get your life back.

01:26:39.297 --> 01:26:40.603
[Kelley]
We'll get our life back.

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:45.825
I wish I could.

01:26:47.218 --> 01:26:48.654
But you know where I'd go.

01:26:50.221 --> 01:26:52.571
I'd go back to the beach.

01:26:52.615 --> 01:26:54.399
[Tess]
Remember when we went to Mexico?

01:26:55.313 --> 01:26:56.662
Back to the water.

01:26:57.663 --> 01:27:00.275
[Tess]
When no one knew what we were.

01:27:01.145 --> 01:27:02.712
It was perfect.

01:27:04.366 --> 01:27:05.671
Nobody knew us.

01:27:08.326 --> 01:27:09.806
It was just you and me.

01:27:10.763 --> 01:27:13.113
Just you and me together.

01:27:14.201 --> 01:27:16.987
Do you really think that
they'll be able to sort through

01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:19.642
what's rightfully mine
and what's theirs?

01:27:20.425 --> 01:27:21.644
[Tess] They can't.

01:27:22.645 --> 01:27:24.995
They don't have
the technology for that.

01:27:25.865 --> 01:27:29.869
That's you. That's me.
That's us. Gone.

01:27:30.696 --> 01:27:33.308
I agreed that they could
have my head.

01:27:34.787 --> 01:27:37.834
I never agreed
that they could have my heart.

01:27:51.021 --> 01:27:52.065
Tess.

You're asking me to bet
my whole life on a postcard.

01:32:41.093 --> 01:32:43.400
Put the gun down, Tess,
and let him die.

01:32:43.443 --> 01:32:44.967
You fucking cunt!

01:32:47.883 --> 01:32:49.711

Killing a virus.

01:33:22.744 --> 01:33:25.660
Finally, a specific place.
