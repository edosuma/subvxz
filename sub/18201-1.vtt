Somebody call a fuckin' ambulance.

02:44.640 --> 02:47.962
What are you all fuckin' lookin' at?
Get some help.

02:48.800 --> 02:51.326
I'll get some help, Tony, please. Oh, jeez.

06:45.526 --> 06:47.126
Oh, shit!

08:18.760 --> 08:23.971
In the name of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.645
Miss! Excuse me!

08:43.240 --> 08:44.685
Miss!

08:47.360 --> 08:48.460
Hey!

Excuse me!

10:25.774 --> 10:26.940
Hello?!

13:19.137 --> 13:20.304
Hello! Hello!

13:32.680 --> 13:37.244
Hello, I need to use the phone!
Phone! Can I use the phone?!

13:43.560 --> 13:47.406
- I need to use the phone, please.
- My granddaughter's birthday.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.531
<i>They love these family gatherings.</i>

13:50.640 --> 13:53.325
- <i>She couldn't be happier, eh?</i>
- Who?

13:54.520 --> 13:58.320
They think that the grass
is always, uh... greener.

13:58.440 --> 14:01.842
<i>She wants to go travelling, meet new people.</i>

14:01.960 --> 14:06.363
I keep telling her, we have some of
the greatest cities, in the world.

14:07.880 --> 14:10.531
Florence, Milan.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.971
Rome, Venice.

14:15.120 --> 14:20.809
- Look, mate. Look, you got to...
- Francesco. Nice to meet you.

14:21.680 --> 14:23.409
Welcome in my country.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.129
Tony.

14:28.240 --> 14:31.528
I understand, but I need to leave.

14:32.400 --> 14:35.483
- You need to leave?
- Yes! I need to leave!

14:35.600 --> 14:39.605
Is where you came from, really better, than this?

14:42.600 --> 14:44.443
Look around you, Tony.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.603
Look where you are.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.048
I don't know where I am.

15:12.160 --> 15:13.764
Pick your feet up.

15:16.240 --> 15:20.689
Trust your fucking mother to
lumber me with you. Come on!

15:29.000 --> 15:33.403
Watch the sounds on the floor.
Sit down. You sit there.

15:34.320 --> 15:38.882
Stay still, don't move. Don't talk to
anybody, don't even look at anybody.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.764
Do you understand?!

16:02.400 --> 16:06.610
- Get the fuck outta here!
- Get the fuck off me!

16:09.520 --> 16:11.807
- Get the fuck off me!
- Shut up!

16:11.920 --> 16:15.322
- Get the fuck off me!
- Shut up!

16:15.440 --> 16:21.288
Help! Help me! Help me, please! Help me, please!
Get the fuck off me!

16:21.400 --> 16:24.028
- Get the fuck off me!
- Shut up!

16:24.048 --> 16:26.747
- Get the fuck off me!
- Shut up!

16:27.148 --> 16:32.848
Get the fuck off me! Help! Help me!
Please, help me!

16:35.800 --> 16:38.402
Hey! Come here!

16:39.160 --> 16:40.764
I told you not to move.

16:43.360 --> 16:49.083
I told you to sit still. Come on.
Sit right here and don't move.

17:27.819 --> 17:29.519
Tony!

17:30.640 --> 17:32.927
Come in. Sit down.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.128
Hey, sit down.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.724
Come on, sit down.

17:45.320 --> 17:49.006
- You want coffee?
- I just want to get out of here, do you mind?

17:49.960 --> 17:54.966
Get out of here? So, you
don't know this place, Tony?

17:55.386 --> 17:56.586
No.

17:58.800 --> 18:01.167
Well, I know it's Italy.

18:01.280 --> 18:05.126
- And everyone's avoiding me.
- They don't know you, Tony.

18:06.930 --> 18:07.897
Thanks.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.604
You don't know why?

18:25.800 --> 18:31.371
So... this place means nothing to you?

18:36.960 --> 18:38.530
Palumbaro.

18:40.640 --> 18:45.123
- Palumbaro.
- Never heard of it.

18:47.320 --> 18:49.288
Perhaps in your past.

18:51.480 --> 18:55.565
The nearest I got to Italy, was
a restaurant down the I street.

18:55.680 --> 18:58.684
Me and the boys used to eat there, you know?

19:00.400 --> 19:04.007
But, my mum took us there when we was kids.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.726
She never mentioned this place?

19:10.346 --> 19:11.446
No.

19:13.680 --> 19:15.205
Why would she?

19:19.000 --> 19:21.367
She died when I was young.

19:22.120 --> 19:25.169
- I'm sorry.
- Long time, now.

19:29.720 --> 19:31.449
Is that your granddaughter?

19:32.920 --> 19:34.331
Yes.

19:40.600 --> 19:43.444
I saw her praying... down the lane.

19:48.840 --> 19:50.251
My wife.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.162
Margherita really misses her.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.609
I do, too.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.328
She became sick.

20:07.280 --> 20:10.727
It was hard... to see her, like that.

20:13.200 --> 20:15.282
It's been two years, now.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.011
Sorry.

20:35.200 --> 20:38.841
- You're come from London, yes?
- Does it show?

20:40.560 --> 20:45.009
Everyone talks about London, London, London.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.645
Mama mia.

20:48.560 --> 20:51.404
You will understand, soon enough.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.370
Anyway, come on.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.763
I have to lock up.

21:39.640 --> 21:41.529
What's that all about?

21:50.320 --> 21:52.687
You don't fucking start again!

22:16.280 --> 22:17.570
What is it?

22:17.990 --> 22:19.590
What is this?

22:29.000 --> 22:33.289
It's cold. You want me to eat this cold?
You want me to eat it?

22:33.400 --> 22:36.324
You want me to fucking eat this cold? This...

22:36.440 --> 22:41.401
Leave the fucking thing. We're
gonna fucking eat. I'll eat it.

22:41.520 --> 22:45.366
I'll fucking eat it. You want me to eat it?
I'll eat it.

22:46.286 --> 22:49.186
Fucking shit. Shit.

22:49.806 --> 22:51.806
I'll fucking eat...

22:52.520 --> 22:53.965
I'll eat it.

23:11.760 --> 23:13.364
Cunt!

23:13.480 --> 23:17.929
Fuck you! Fuck this fucking house! Fuck ya!

24:15.400 --> 24:17.926
Your granddaughter is a beautiful girl.

24:18.880 --> 24:20.325
Yes, she is.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.168
I don't know what she sees in him.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.689
He's trouble.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.405
Are all you English trouble?

26:28.000 --> 26:31.800
Come on. Now, if there is no
language barrier, Freddie.

26:32.720 --> 26:35.943
There's hundreds of language in the world, Tony.
Nobody speaks different languages.

26:35.964 --> 26:40.101
- Nobody has a clue whatever you're saying...
- We are not speaking the same language.

26:40.200 --> 26:41.929
Come on, make me laugh.

26:42.040 --> 26:45.681
- This guy joins this religious order...
- Now, here we go.

26:45.800 --> 26:48.565
He's in the middle of a joke, love. Do you mind?

26:52.000 --> 26:55.971
- Don't bring your mum up here all the time.
- You still with us?

26:56.080 --> 26:59.527
I've a one track mind, but
it's on the right track.

26:59.640 --> 27:02.060
Well, anyway, this guy joins this
religious order and the rules are,

27:02.081 --> 27:04.348
you're only allowed to take
two words every ten years.

27:04.440 --> 27:08.570
First ten years are up, he goes up to the head
monk and says: "Bad food," and he leaves.

27:08.680 --> 27:11.256
Second ten years are up,
twenty years and he goes to

27:11.277 --> 27:13.706
the head monk and says: Hard bed, "and he leaves.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.126
Third ten years are up, thirty years
later, he sees the head monk,

27:16.147 --> 27:18.428
 he says: "Can't sleep," and leaves.

27:18.520 --> 27:22.650
Fourth ten years are up, forty years later, he
goes in to the head monk, he says: "I'm leaving."

27:22.760 --> 27:27.209
Head monk says: "Oh, fucking time. All
you've done is bone since you got here. "

32:07.120 --> 32:09.441
- Where were you?
- What's goin' on?

32:09.560 --> 32:11.562
- Nothing.
- What goin' on?

32:11.680 --> 32:15.002
I was in the rehearsal. And you? Where were you?

32:18.000 --> 32:20.287
- Come on, have some fun.
- Let's go.

32:20.400 --> 32:25.167
- No, I want-I want to stay with the others.
- Let's go. I've got me bike.

32:58.040 --> 33:01.268
- Margherita, coffee, please.
- <i>Right away.</i>

33:01.288 --> 33:02.988
Thank you.

33:04.782 --> 33:05.882
Tony!

33:08.200 --> 33:10.282
Thank you.

33:10.840 --> 33:12.444
Sit down.

33:15.120 --> 33:16.724
Coffee?

33:16.840 --> 33:19.411
Why is everyone so here unfriendly in this town?

33:19.520 --> 33:22.888
The people don't know how to take you, Tony.

33:23.000 --> 33:28.689
Yes. A strange man, alone.
In this old-fashioned place.

33:28.800 --> 33:33.886
- Nothing changed here, in 100 years.
- You could say that again.

33:34.000 --> 33:38.801
- Look, I just need to get near a phone.
- Nearest one is the... next village.

33:38.920 --> 33:41.685
You are lost in the dark ages, i'n't ya?

33:41.800 --> 33:45.885
Look, I appreciate all of this, coffee
and all the chats and things, but...

33:46.000 --> 33:48.207
- I just want to go home.
- Why?

33:49.200 --> 33:52.568
Have you found out why you're here, yet?

33:52.680 --> 33:55.411
No. I just wanna get back to England.

33:57.400 --> 34:00.370
At least someone found their way home.

34:00.480 --> 34:02.084
She's a good girl.

34:03.040 --> 34:08.603
She lives and works here with her
friends. But she's not happy, Tony.

34:08.719 --> 34:10.802
She looks happy to me.

34:11.880 --> 34:16.761
She's in love with a-an English boy. She wants
to go to travelling to London, you know?

34:16.880 --> 34:19.087
Ah, London's OK.

34:20.840 --> 34:24.208
- It's not how you remember it, Tony.
- What are you talking about?

34:24.320 --> 34:27.927
I've spent me whole life in London.
It's a fantastic city.

34:28.040 --> 34:31.487
Perhaps I am... just an old man, talking.

34:34.000 --> 34:38.005
- But if you want to use the phone...
- Yes, the phone! Where is it?

34:38.120 --> 34:39.724
It's in the next village.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.408
Good luck, Tony.

37:52.419 --> 37:54.419
Tony, Tony! Tony!

37:54.440 --> 37:56.727
- Margherita's missing.
- What?

37:56.840 --> 38:00.007
- I had a fight with her, yesterday.
- About her boyfriend?

38:00.020 --> 38:05.311
Yes! I don't know where she is gone, now.
I look everywhere, but...

38:05.720 --> 38:08.485
Calm down, calm down. I'll look for her.

38:56.680 --> 39:00.651
I'm  forever blowing bubbles

39:00.760 --> 39:04.446
pretty bubbles in the air

39:05.280 --> 39:07.044
They fly so high

39:07.160 --> 39:13.122
up to the sky

39:15.040 --> 39:17.884
- And, and then?
- Just like my dreams

39:20.360 --> 39:23.045
all dreams always hiding

39:23.160 --> 39:28.200
- that's all they hiding
- No, they hide forever.

39:28.320 --> 39:33.121
- Yes, and?
- I looked everywhere

39:34.120 --> 39:41.846
I'm forever blowing bubbles
pretty bubbles in the air

39:41.960 --> 39:44.486
Brava!

39:52.800 --> 39:56.930
- You found her, Tony?
- Yes, I found her. She's with the English boy.

39:57.040 --> 40:01.284
- And I gotta say, they look pretty good together.
- It's not that we disapprove.

40:02.840 --> 40:05.207
What... what do we do?

40:06.080 --> 40:11.041
But this guy, he want takes her away...
from her studies, Tony.

40:11.920 --> 40:15.447
She's an artist. And a natural, too.

40:15.560 --> 40:18.294
So let 'em go, these kids.
Let 'em do their own thing.

40:18.315 --> 40:20.302
She want to go travelling with him.

40:20.400 --> 40:24.121
If she live with him in London,
she never come back here.

40:24.240 --> 40:27.313
Of course, she will. They
always come back, don't they?

40:27.334 --> 40:28.946
She have to stay here.

40:29.440 --> 40:31.807
This is her land, Tony.

40:31.920 --> 40:37.245
I don't want to lose her.
Here, is her destiny, Tony.

40:41.480 --> 40:46.088
We have to do something. I
know exactly what to do.

40:46.200 --> 40:51.730
Stop it. Not violence, Tony.
Not violence, please.

41:18.840 --> 41:21.844
I can't wait to go to London.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.530
With you, my love.

41:25.960 --> 41:31.364
I want to see everything. Every
places, every... every cities.

41:32.400 --> 41:35.847
And I want to sing with you. Every time we do.

41:38.360 --> 41:44.527
I want to visit Bath, York, Canterbary.

41:44.640 --> 41:45.828
Canterbury.

41:46.148 --> 41:47.148
Cantabry.

41:47.268 --> 41:48.468
Canterbury.

41:48.488 --> 41:49.888
Cannbury.

41:50.840 --> 41:52.365
- Yes.
- That'll do.

41:58.360 --> 41:59.964
What's that?

42:02.120 --> 42:05.488
- What is from your town?
- Will you shut the fuck up?

42:16.640 --> 42:22.283
- Sorry, my love.
- You shut the fuck up, right?

42:22.400 --> 42:23.970
You got it?

42:34.680 --> 42:36.250
I'm sorry.

42:38.240 --> 42:41.325
I'm sorry. OK? I'm sorry.

42:42.880 --> 42:45.451
Margherita, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK?

42:46.471 --> 42:50.071
I'm sorry. Come here. Come here.

42:50.291 --> 42:53.191
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come on.

42:54.111 --> 42:57.011
I'm sorry, OK? I'm sorry.

42:57.080 --> 43:00.926
You alright? You OK? Look at me. Look at me.

43:01.040 --> 43:03.441
You alright? You OK, then? Yeah.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.684
I'm sorry.

43:07.504 --> 43:12.604
OK? Yes? Yeah? OK?

43:13.360 --> 43:17.922
Yeah, say yeah. Say yeah. Say yeah. Go on.

43:18.040 --> 43:19.922
- You know I'm sorry, don't you?
- I don't know.

43:19.942 --> 43:22.542
You do. You know I'm sorry. OK.

43:51.120 --> 43:53.885
What, no kisses this time? Not
with that around your faces, no?

43:54.000 --> 43:57.846
I was gonna tell you, mate, but I
just had to let Tony see it...

43:57.960 --> 44:02.045
- Why, what's the problem?
- It's not good news, Tony. No one has any money.

44:02.160 --> 44:05.687
Of course, they have. It's just
you two are not getting it.

44:05.800 --> 44:08.438
But the people we've been dealing with
just haven't got the business, anymore.

44:08.459 --> 44:09.871
There's cash places!

44:09.960 --> 44:12.566
I don't have a problem gettin' the money!

44:12.680 --> 44:14.845
Look, we've tried, Tony, but they're all in debt.

44:14.860 --> 44:18.543
Right, then, we need to show 'em
that we mean business, fellas.

45:32.520 --> 45:35.000
Surprise.

47:20.480 --> 47:24.724
- Are not you afraid of that?
- No.

47:28.600 --> 47:30.602
- Really?
- Yes.

49:45.520 --> 49:47.090
Good evening.

49:51.200 --> 49:52.725
Fabrizio.

49:54.520 --> 49:58.002
- Good day.
- Good evening.

49:58.120 --> 50:00.566
Yeah, that's what I said. We play a game, then?

50:00.586 --> 50:02.886
No. No. No. No.

50:02.920 --> 50:05.287
- Not even for a friend?
- Money.

50:06.080 --> 50:07.764
Tony, money.

50:15.840 --> 50:17.410
How's that?

50:18.960 --> 50:21.930
You happy? Huh? He's happy, isn't he?

50:22.231 --> 50:23.459
- Alright?
- Thank you.

50:23.480 --> 50:25.164
Pour me a fucking drink, man.

50:28.840 --> 50:30.285
Cheers.

50:43.080 --> 50:45.560
Terry. Honey.

51:30.840 --> 51:33.844
Don't think your debt's paid.

51:33.960 --> 51:40.161
- What was all that about, then?
- That was your last fucking warning.

52:08.200 --> 52:10.441
That's a shit hand, isn't it?

52:10.560 --> 52:12.847
- Terry.
- What? I'm in...

52:12.960 --> 52:16.487
- Terry, you have no money.
- I can get money, alright? Don't worry about it.

52:16.600 --> 52:17.826
- Wait, that's enough.
- I've got money!

52:17.846 --> 52:19.139
Where you gonna find money?

52:19.240 --> 52:24.421
It doesn't matter, where. I'm good for it, alright?
Now come on, show or go. What you gonna do?

52:27.680 --> 52:31.162
Well, he's out, now. What you doin', then?

52:36.960 --> 52:39.770
- Terry, you got no money.
- I can get money. I told you that.

52:39.880 --> 52:42.531
- Where you gonna get money from?
- I got money, alright? Don't worry about it.

52:42.640 --> 52:44.290
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

52:45.480 --> 52:47.847
- I see you.
- You're seeing me?

52:48.267 --> 52:49.867
Yeah?

52:49.960 --> 52:52.247
How 'bout you fucking see these, then.

53:07.560 --> 53:09.770
- Where'd you get those cards from?
- It's over.

53:09.790 --> 53:10.479
- What?
- It's over.

53:10.480 --> 53:16.601
How do you get those cards? You fucking old cunt!

53:16.720 --> 53:20.566
Where'd you get these cards? Get the
fuck off of me. Get the fuck off of me.

53:20.680 --> 53:23.982
Where did you get these fucking cards, hey?
Where'd you get 'em?

53:24.003 --> 53:25.627
I know where your little girl live, eh?

53:26.520 --> 53:27.442
Margherita.

53:27.463 --> 53:30.227
You what? Don't you fucking... you fucking
touch her. You fucking touch her, I'll do ya!

53:30.320 --> 53:33.085
Home! Go home. Arriverderci. Home!

53:33.200 --> 53:34.929
Arriva-fucking-what?

53:35.040 --> 53:38.647
- How do you get it?
- That's enough.

53:38.760 --> 53:44.005
Come on, leave me, you fucking cunts. Fuck off!
Yeah, here with my jacket.

53:45.280 --> 53:49.649
I'll be fucking back for you, fucking cunts.
Especially fucking you.

53:54.320 --> 53:56.084
Yeah, sit.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.002
Fucking sneaky cat.

56:33.200 --> 56:35.931
Happy card. Fuck off.

57:36.760 --> 57:38.364
Calm down, John.

57:39.720 --> 57:42.451
John, calm yourself down.

57:47.680 --> 57:50.028
Now, you know you owe us four and a
half grand and you're walking about

57:50.049 --> 57:52.627
 without a care in the world. Yeah?

57:58.920 --> 58:01.886
You've gotta be very careful where
you walk, these days, John.

58:01.907 --> 58:05.763
Or you never know what else
can happen out there. Eh?

58:13.560 --> 58:16.882
I was really curious, when I was a kid, you know?

58:17.000 --> 58:20.561
I used to do things, uh... other kids wouldn't do.

58:24.720 --> 58:27.121
Like a moth in the, uh...

58:28.720 --> 58:30.370
the burning flame.

58:32.800 --> 58:34.404
You know what I mean?

58:37.240 --> 58:38.844
You know what I mean.

58:41.200 --> 58:46.586
You know... I think it was preparing me
for what I do more like today, you know?

58:46.600 --> 58:49.649
I mean, I can do things other men can't do.

58:49.760 --> 58:51.330
Move your hand away.

58:52.200 --> 58:54.930
- Let me go home, and I'll get your money.
- Open your mouth, John. Open your mouth.

58:54.950 --> 58:56.239
Let me go home, and I'll get your money.

58:56.440 --> 59:01.446
Look, John, just open your mouth. John, John,
John. I'm gonna get blood all over me, mate.

59:01.560 --> 59:04.404
Open your mouth. Open your mouth. Open your mouth.

59:05.240 --> 59:09.484
That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it.
It's in there. That's in there.

59:10.320 --> 59:13.563
- Alright, now don't move.
- I'll get your money.

59:22.200 --> 59:24.009
Stay still.

59:27.360 --> 59:29.727
This'll be over in a minute. So what?

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:45.486
I got something to show you, but
I'm not sure you're gonna like it.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.610
Good evening.

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.681
Good evening, Francesco.

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.484
It's just down here.

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:46.126
<i>I knew. He was no good.</i>

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:50.325
<i>- Did he see you?
- Yeah. He saw me.</i>

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.408
<i>Good. Good.</i>

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.886
- How you gonna tell her?
- I can't.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.049
What do you mean, you can't? She needs to know.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:05.964
She will make the right decision, Tony.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.245
Don't worry.

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:29.770
Calm down.

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.724
Where do you think I'm goin'?! What
do you think I'm up to?! What, do you

01:05:52.745 --> 01:05:55.067
think I'm fucking gallavanting
about all over the place?!

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:59.006
I'm trying to get a lving, a
fucking living for you and him!

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:04.251
Why is he, just fucking listen to him! Adults
talk to him! He doesn't fucking listen to me!

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:09.491
Not to me! He never fucking listens to me!
Not when you fucking show up!

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:11.967
Fucking shit, how it is.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:34.120
Oh, that's it. Smash the fucking kitchen up now!

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:39.062
Get up. Get up! Oi!

01:06:41.082 --> 01:06:44.482
Wait. Oi! Wait.

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.756
Wait. Come here. What's the matter?
What's the matter?

01:06:46.777 --> 01:06:49.051
What's the matter? What's the matter?
What's the matter?

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:50.730
Stand up.

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:56.682
What have you done?

01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:59.087
What have you fucking done?

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:05.405
Marie. Marie. Marie. Come on. Come on, wake up.
Wake up. Wake up. Don't, stand up.

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:11.763
Breathe. Breathe. Stand up. Stand up.

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:18.090
Stand up, please, come on. Get up. Get up.
Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up.

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:53.165
- Terry.
- Hey, what's wrong?

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:58.204
- Our apartment. Everything has gone.
- What?

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:02.970
Where were you the last night? I
thought you were at the apartment.

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:07.722
I was just gonna take care of that business, that's
all. Before we go to London. What's missing?

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:12.203
- Everything. All the money for the trip.
- What?

01:08:16.439 --> 01:08:20.645
- Our money for our trip, Terry.
- It's alright. It's fine.

01:08:25.439 --> 01:08:27.044
Come on. Let's go.

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:07.720
- What you after, lads?
- Where's your dad?

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:11.082
He's not here at the moment.
What can I do you for?

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:12.884
Just get  him, sweetheart.

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:18.203
- It's alright, darling.
- No, it's not alright.

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:21.407
You're late with your payment.

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:28.526
Look, I've told you before.
I haven't got it, alright?

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:31.120
You better find it.

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:35.131
- What happens if I don't pay it?
- We'll take everything you own.

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:36.685
Even her.

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:42.091
- Can we do this somewhere else?
- Of course.

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.080
I can't believe you done that.

01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:48.863
You know me. I like to leave
my mark on 'em, Tony.

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:55.643
Hang on. Hello?

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:58.366
- Uh, Tone?
- Kevin.

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:01.211
Yeah, I-I'm sorry about all that stuff, earlier.

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.592
Look, I'll have it sorted by
the end of today. I promise.

01:10:04.613 --> 01:10:07.540
Well, alright, then, 'cause we don't
wanna come 'round there again, mate.

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:09.244
Of course.

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:13.733
He sends his love.

01:10:13.754 --> 01:10:16.791
Still think he mighta been
behindin' a bill, Tony.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.724
They knew the consequences when
they borrowed the money, right?

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:23.367
They make you laugh, don't they?
We're a business! What is it here?

01:10:24.587 --> 01:10:26.587
Sheeesh...

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:28.839
She was lovely, wasn't she?

01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:31.347
Oh, yeah. I wouldn't mind
leaving my mark on her, too.

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:34.091
- Now, that would make her laugh.
- Tony.

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:36.043
Is everything gonna be OK, Dad?

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:40.530
Yeah. Of course it is.

01:10:41.479 --> 01:10:43.179
Yeah?

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:44.770
Yeah. We'll be alright.

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:15.445
Let's celebrate, fellas. Kevin's
pub is ours for the takin'.

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:17.528
Why, what's happened, then, Tony?

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:23.888
You know he can't afford to do it up, or pay me.
So I'm takin' it.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.446
Well, here's to Tony two clubs, then.

01:11:26.766 --> 01:11:28.166
Dad?

01:11:29.186 --> 01:11:30.586
Dad?

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:36.645
He took the coward's way out. Cheers, boys.
Good day's work.

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:31.931
Who would do this, hey? Break into
your fucking flat and rob ya?

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:36.127
Take all your money and all your jewelry.

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:41.846
I'll tell ya one thing, I find out
who it was, I'll fucking kill him.

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:28.923
- I gotta get outta here.
- Why do you want to go?

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:32.009
- There's something wrong with me.
- What's wrong?

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:35.875
Don't know, there's something wrong with me.
I don't know what it is. I can't explain.

01:13:35.896 --> 01:13:37.147
Do not be so theatrical.

01:13:40.339 --> 01:13:41.639
Tell me that...

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:48.420
- Tell me that's an old newspaper? Please.
- Yes, it's today's newspaper.

01:13:51.505 --> 01:13:53.805
Oh, God. I've gotta get out...

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.882
You said you didn't have a telephone.

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:01.288
I gotta get outta here.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.847
- You know what's going on, Tony?
- I don't . No, I don't.

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:11.406
You know what's going on.

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:14.291
Come here.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:17.567
Tony, come on.

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:29.367
He's crazy, this man.

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:56.650
I had, uh... I found that downstairs. It was by
the door. I just put it in my pocket. I was...

01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:00.810
I don't want to hear any more lies.

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:03.207
- I just...
- You're only a lier.

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:07.120
I found it downstairs. I picked it up and I put it
in my pocket. I was gonna give it to you later.

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:08.881
- Shut up!
- You watch your fucking mouth.

01:16:08.902 --> 01:16:13.427
- Stupid and poor man.
- I found it I was gonna fucking give it to ya.

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:16.569
- Goodbye, goodbye, Terry!
- You stay here! Don't you fucking go anywhere!

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:26.528
Fucking get back here! Come back here!
I'll find ya! I'll fucking find ya!

01:16:35.796 --> 01:16:36.896

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:20.770
<i>Dad?</i>

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:24.609
Fuck off.

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:49.129
What are you waiting for?

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:10.921
Go and fuck off for your auntie.

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:13.931
Go on.

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:19.321
- <i>I'm gonna look afer the boy.</i>
- Fuck off.

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:37.980
What do you think I'm doing?

01:21:38.001 --> 01:21:41.501
Shut the fuck up, right? You do

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:43.568
Get up. get up.

01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:48.607
You OK? Come on, look at me.
Are you OK? You alright?

01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:55.407
She's an artist. And a natural, too.

01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:58.842
She have to stay here. This is her land, Tony.

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:00.644
I don't want to lose her.

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:04.686
Here is her destiny, Tony.

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:06.928
I'll fucking find ya!

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:09.768
Can I have a word, please?

01:24:10.588 --> 01:24:11.688
Please.

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:34.288
I made a mistake, you know? I'm so sorry.

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:37.529
- I need you to forgive me, OK?
- I can't.

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:41.440
I need you to. I love you. I love you so much.

01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:45.246
- No, you don't love me.
- I do. I do.

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:55.320
I love you. I need you to forgive me, alright?
Please. Please, OK? Please. Please.

01:24:55.740 --> 01:24:58.440
No, no, no, no, no.

01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:04.531
- It's over, Terry.
- No, no. Don't say that. You can't say that.

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:06.130
Go home.

01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:10.601
- I love you.
- Go home.

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:13.367
- Hey, you're coming with me. Right fucking now.

01:25:13.387 --> 01:25:15.587
You're coming with me, now! You're

You're fucking coming with
me, right this fucking...!

01:25:18.927 --> 01:25:21.119
- Let go of my daughter!
- Fuck off!

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:23.441
- Fuck off!
- My daughter!

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:29.828
- Get out.
- Margherita!

01:25:29.848 --> 01:25:30.847
Go on!

01:25:30.848 --> 01:25:32.448
Come on!

01:25:33.338 --> 01:25:34.438
Fuck!

01:25:50.999 --> 01:25:52.199
Tony!

01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:55.087
- You OK?
- Yeah.

01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:58.610
English boy.

01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:01.648
He's trouble. Trouble.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.766
- I can't thank you enough, Tony.
- I didn't do anything, mate.

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:15.170
You did more than you can imagine.

01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:20.968
You know why I'm here, don't ya?

01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:26.360
And you will know soon enough.

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:30.289
I think I know already.

01:26:31.109 --> 01:26:32.209
Yes.

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:43.808
Your great-great-grandmother
once told me a story, Tony.

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:49.686
One day, while she was working the land,

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:53.771
she came across a gold coin,
by the side of the road.

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:58.202
Times were difficult, so she buried the coin,

01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:01.642
waiting for the day when she would need it.

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:10.206
Two days later, a young man came to
the village, looking for the coin.

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:13.210
Even though the coin would change her life...

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:18.411
honesty got the better of your grandmother...

01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:21.091
and she led the man to the coin.

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:27.883
The coin was given to the man, by his
father, and to his father before him.

01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:33.084
It was of such importance to the man

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:40.846
that he vowed to bring the crops from the south,
for our family, every year... during Winter.

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:48.646
The man came for many years.
Until, one year, he stayed.

01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:53.765
Our family only survived because of this man.

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:57.408
This man was my father.

01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:04.331
- So, if there's any problem, just give me a ring.
- Alright. We'll be alright.

01:28:04.352 --> 01:28:05.630
Come on, we got a table booked.

01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:08.867
- OK, uhh... yeah, uh, I got my wallet.
- No, I'm paying.

01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:11.009
- Oh, yeah, as if!
- Shut up! Come on!

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:12.884
- See ya, Leish.
- <i>See ya!</i>

01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:23.082
Sometimes, we have to sacrifice what we
have, to protect those that we love.

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:27.769
Thank you, Tony.

01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:46.850
<i>I have shown you what you needed to see.</i>

01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:50.287
<i>It's up to you, now, Tony.</i>
