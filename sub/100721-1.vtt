00:00.677 --> 00:03.760
(film reel whirring)

00:13.701 --> 00:16.118
(soft music)

00:21.130 --> 00:22.540
- [Narrator] My dearest parish,

00:22.540 --> 00:25.900
first-timers, and fellow mavericks ...

00:25.900 --> 00:29.660
did you know, ever since
I could hold a camera,

00:29.660 --> 00:31.419
I wanted to be a filmmaker?

00:31.419 --> 00:34.002
(lively music)

02:02.307 --> 02:05.590
Before today, the bravest thing I ever did

02:05.590 --> 02:07.563
was sneak into the movies.

02:08.850 --> 02:10.470
One time I brought my family.

02:10.470 --> 02:12.440
Told them I already paid.

02:12.440 --> 02:14.560
I led them to the back door pearly gates

02:14.560 --> 02:16.703
of my new house of worship.

02:17.980 --> 02:18.813
And was caught.

02:19.650 --> 02:22.010
The shame was unbearable.

02:23.700 --> 02:27.310
And, well, sometimes you
just don't have the money.

02:27.310 --> 02:28.820
This reminds me of a revelation

02:28.820 --> 02:30.870
my new film mentor taught me:

02:30.870 --> 02:33.360
how your artistic vision justifies

02:33.360 --> 02:36.930
any supposed consequences and sacrifices.

02:36.930 --> 02:40.807
It's summed up by that great
film director, Werner Herzog:

02:40.807 --> 02:43.887
"If you need air to breathe,
and you are locked in a room,

02:43.887 --> 02:47.137
"you have to take a chisel and
hammer and break down a wall.

02:47.137 --> 02:50.080
"It is your absolute right."

02:50.080 --> 02:53.073
And it's my absolute right to hustle.

02:54.530 --> 02:58.830
I just needed a mentor, a
guide, to help make my movie,

02:58.830 --> 03:00.430
read over my screenplay.

03:00.430 --> 03:03.320
A producer will do just fine.

03:03.320 --> 03:04.830
I usually start with ...

03:04.830 --> 03:05.977
- James Wagner, right?

03:05.977 --> 03:08.590
- [Narrator] "Hi, I'm
an aspiring filmmaker.

03:08.590 --> 03:11.222
- I called your office, but
no one's gotten back to me.

03:11.222 --> 03:13.650
- [Narrator] "I will do anything
to make my first feature."

03:13.650 --> 03:15.933
- Where does a sick boat go to get better?

03:18.020 --> 03:19.290
The dock!

03:19.290 --> 03:21.610
Like, the dock?

03:21.610 --> 03:24.350
Doc, dock, D-O-C, D-O-C-K.

03:24.350 --> 03:25.840
- [Narrator] Mama warned
me against the abuse,

03:25.840 --> 03:29.263
the affliction, nevermind
the burden and betrayal.

03:31.280 --> 03:34.120
I told myself it was all part of the game.

03:34.120 --> 03:35.770
- I'd love to come work for you.

03:35.770 --> 03:37.233
- Oh, that's great.

03:37.233 --> 03:38.783
(stuttering)
I'll be in touch.

03:39.704 --> 03:41.760
- [Narrator] And my blue skies vanished.

03:41.760 --> 03:45.093
- Brushed out by the
strokes of a familiar storm.

03:45.971 --> 03:48.048
And again I'm naked in the world.

03:48.048 --> 03:49.576
- Miss Peach!

03:49.576 --> 03:50.503
Enough!

03:50.503 --> 03:52.090
Holy Jesus!

03:52.090 --> 03:54.920
Please streamline your sob story.

03:54.920 --> 03:55.830
- Yes, sir.

03:55.830 --> 03:58.261
I just got caught up in the fact that--

03:58.261 --> 03:59.094
(slams phone)

03:59.094 --> 04:01.480
- For the love of God
and all that is holy,

04:01.480 --> 04:04.170
please get to the part
where you meet your idol

04:04.170 --> 04:08.170
and newly found mentor, Claire Adams!

04:08.170 --> 04:10.163
Don't forget that one important detail.

04:11.000 --> 04:11.833
- Sir?

04:11.833 --> 04:13.183
One important detail?

04:14.530 --> 04:16.000
- Can you believe this?

04:16.000 --> 04:19.400
Miss Georgia asking about
the one important detail.

04:19.400 --> 04:21.250
I'm surrounded by idiots, I tell you.

04:23.780 --> 04:25.383
(sighs)

04:25.383 --> 04:27.383
(claps)

04:28.364 --> 04:30.240
- My mama always said you need a guide

04:30.240 --> 04:32.483
to get anywhere of importance.

04:33.680 --> 04:36.110
- [Narrator] My mind droned
until the end of days

04:36.110 --> 04:40.980
for a solution, like them
cicadas in early summer.

04:40.980 --> 04:43.600
By providence, I chanced upon

04:43.600 --> 04:47.840
the next great female
director of our century.

04:47.840 --> 04:49.150
- [Mr. Owl] Oh, good God.

04:49.150 --> 04:50.990
Of your century?

04:50.990 --> 04:51.823
- [Narrator] Yes, sir.

04:56.710 --> 04:58.770
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

04:58.770 --> 04:59.603
- No worries.

05:03.587 --> 05:05.110
- [Mr. Owl] "No worries."

05:05.110 --> 05:07.180
Damn Canadians taking over.

05:07.180 --> 05:08.680
- Enough with the reminiscing.

05:09.530 --> 05:10.780
You want ransom?

05:10.780 --> 05:12.050
I have nothing.

05:12.050 --> 05:13.140
My family?

05:13.140 --> 05:14.686
Nothing.

05:14.686 --> 05:15.936
- A reckoning's a-coming.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.960
- I think that, well, wasn't it

05:18.960 --> 05:20.940
the Australians that said that?

05:20.940 --> 05:22.890
- [Mr. Owl] Australians, Kiwis, English,

05:22.890 --> 05:25.213
stupid Queen worshipers all the same.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.283
- Commonwealth lowlifes.

05:30.009 --> 05:32.009
(spits)

05:37.514 --> 05:39.764
(clanging)

05:40.875 --> 05:41.708
- Ma'am, I'm sorry.

05:41.708 --> 05:43.200
- [Claire] No worries.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.170
- [Narrator] My prayers answered,

05:45.170 --> 05:47.560
this was my life-defining moment.

05:47.560 --> 05:48.997
I ran to her and said:

05:48.997 --> 05:50.633
- When I watch your films,

05:52.050 --> 05:54.560
I know I'm not alone in the world.

05:54.560 --> 05:56.350
I believe these are yours.

05:56.350 --> 05:57.183
- Where did you--

05:57.183 --> 05:59.560
- And you are an
inspiration not just to me,

05:59.560 --> 06:01.030
but to all female filmmakers.

06:01.030 --> 06:02.240
- Well, that means a lot to me.

06:02.240 --> 06:03.210
It was really nice to meet you.

06:03.210 --> 06:05.160
I'm sorry, I have an important meeting.

06:06.652 --> 06:07.711
- Miss Adams!

06:07.711 --> 06:10.496
(grunting)

06:10.496 --> 06:12.180
I want to make my own feature films.

06:12.180 --> 06:14.260
I'm a screenwriter of sorts.

06:14.260 --> 06:15.093
- I just ...

06:15.093 --> 06:16.460
I need a little help,

06:16.460 --> 06:18.920
someone to read my work and give advice.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.610
I need a mentor.

06:20.610 --> 06:23.670
- Sorry, I'm in pre-production
and busy with funding.

06:23.670 --> 06:25.433
- Even John Ford had a mentor.

06:26.580 --> 06:29.120
Well, he did play a
Klansman in that KKK film.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.270
- Bah, a racist character
doesn't translate

06:30.270 --> 06:31.640
into a racist actor.

06:31.640 --> 06:34.010
- See, I don't know these things.

06:34.010 --> 06:35.250
Look, how about just today?

06:35.250 --> 06:37.640
Your Independent Courage
Award is at 8:00, right?

06:37.640 --> 06:38.610
From now to then?

06:38.610 --> 06:39.840
- Well, shit.

06:39.840 --> 06:41.790
And it's the Independent Bravery Award.

06:42.890 --> 06:46.770
- And Miss Adams, will
you read my screenplay?

06:46.770 --> 06:48.470
Please, Miss Adams.

06:48.470 --> 06:53.093
- Classic: will you read my screenplay?

06:54.830 --> 06:56.760
Aren't you forgetting
one eensy teensy bit?

06:56.760 --> 06:57.593
Yes?

06:57.593 --> 06:58.550
- Come on.

06:58.550 --> 07:00.120
What's your play?

07:00.120 --> 07:01.320
- Everything's in order.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.240
- Is that 8:00 p.m.
deadline eating away at you?

07:18.010 --> 07:19.250
- See?

07:19.250 --> 07:21.470
Right here he says my writing is terrible,

07:21.470 --> 07:22.670
that I have no conflict.

07:25.140 --> 07:26.643
- Idiots, the lot of them.

07:29.170 --> 07:30.590
- Can you believe it?

07:30.590 --> 07:33.800
God, I hate script readers!

07:33.800 --> 07:36.150
I would kill every last
one of them if I could.

07:40.820 --> 07:41.653
- You're warm.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.343
Check your ketone levels.

07:45.660 --> 07:47.820
- I'm glad I have a good guide.

07:47.820 --> 07:49.000
Not good.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.220
Great.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.053
Great guide.

07:53.366 --> 07:55.166
I just don't think I should be here.

07:56.580 --> 07:58.540
- This is the new normal.

07:58.540 --> 08:01.460
The only way to learn is
to leverage experience.

08:01.460 --> 08:03.923
What, you thought you were you
gonna read a book about this?

08:11.040 --> 08:13.110
Keep it going, Mrs. Peaches!

08:13.110 --> 08:15.320
- [Narrator] She was very accommodating.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.530
First, we hunkered down in the library

08:17.530 --> 08:19.173
to get some real work done.

08:20.930 --> 08:22.660
- Let's get right to it.

08:22.660 --> 08:25.970
It's unoriginal, boring, and predictable.

08:25.970 --> 08:28.623
The formatting pathetic, dialogue cliche.

08:29.730 --> 08:30.763
It's a mess.

08:32.140 --> 08:34.310
- Did you like any of it?

08:34.310 --> 08:35.973
I followed all the books.

08:37.040 --> 08:39.040
I got a great gut punch
in the middle, right?

08:39.040 --> 08:41.480
- Yeah, the books.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.060
The manuals.

08:43.060 --> 08:45.740
Just as there's no manual
on how to touch the soul,

08:45.740 --> 08:49.003
there's no book worth reading
on how to write a screenplay.

08:49.860 --> 08:53.340
- I have the inciting
incident on page 11--

08:53.340 --> 08:54.430
- I've had the good sense

08:54.430 --> 08:56.283
never to read books on screenwriting.

08:58.450 --> 08:59.750
Is that guy staring at us?

09:03.320 --> 09:04.350
- Never?

09:04.350 --> 09:06.710
- We revere stories.

09:06.710 --> 09:09.070
At no other time in history
has a culture devoted

09:09.070 --> 09:12.353
this much time, this much money to ...

09:13.310 --> 09:14.573
to generate drama.

09:15.560 --> 09:16.450
- I guess so.

09:16.450 --> 09:19.240
- Just like the French staple
duck's feet to the floor,

09:19.240 --> 09:21.960
insert a tube and force
feed corn down its gullet,

09:21.960 --> 09:24.260
parents prop us up in front of the TV

09:24.260 --> 09:26.313
and choke us with narrative.

09:27.950 --> 09:30.400
- Maybe you should just keep reading.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.761
I have an ending the
Dadaists would be proud of.

09:32.761 --> 09:34.140
(sighs)

09:34.140 --> 09:36.040
My script is an anti-script.

09:36.040 --> 09:36.953
- It's shit.

09:38.650 --> 09:40.210
No one's telling you.

09:40.210 --> 09:41.203
So I'm telling you.

09:44.880 --> 09:48.033
Not everybody can't be
a novelist, a filmmaker.

09:49.140 --> 09:53.030
You need a kind of ferocity,
a beast inside of you

09:53.030 --> 09:56.393
that wants to, that needs
to burst out of you.

09:58.050 --> 09:59.113
Do you have that?

10:00.065 --> 10:00.898
- No.

10:00.898 --> 10:02.610
I mean yes.

10:02.610 --> 10:03.723
Somewhere in there.

10:04.930 --> 10:07.510
- Artists experiment with narratives.

10:07.510 --> 10:10.423
Sometimes it works, and
sometimes is doesn't.

10:11.490 --> 10:12.323
Look around you.

10:13.770 --> 10:16.623
Libraries should depress
the artist who seeks truth.

10:23.030 --> 10:23.880
I've got an idea.

10:25.943 --> 10:29.370
(speaking in foreign language)

10:29.370 --> 10:30.979
- Is this the second or third act?

10:30.979 --> 10:31.812
- Shh!

10:39.150 --> 10:41.030
- Miss Adams, can you
explain the three acts?

10:41.030 --> 10:42.179
I couldn't find them.

10:42.179 --> 10:43.012
(scoffs)

10:43.012 --> 10:45.080
Dilettantes rely to the
three act structure.

10:45.080 --> 10:47.530
Sure, use it to converse
with the layperson,

10:47.530 --> 10:50.640
but to birth, to nurture a story?

10:50.640 --> 10:52.520
To ignite the soul?

10:52.520 --> 10:53.990
- I didn't notice a character arc.

10:53.990 --> 10:55.640
- Character arcs?

10:55.640 --> 10:57.060
The preferred utensils of cowards

10:57.060 --> 10:58.860
and those of weak constitution.

10:58.860 --> 11:01.500
People don't change, not really.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.100
What's critical is our
how your audience evolves

11:03.100 --> 11:04.773
to understand your characters.

11:05.610 --> 11:06.810
- What about the endings?

11:06.810 --> 11:08.000
Do I need to know--

11:08.000 --> 11:09.500
- Unhappy, morose endings,

11:09.500 --> 11:11.340
ones that happen and then it's over.

11:11.340 --> 11:14.840
Your hero dies somehow, either
internally or externally.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.200
Force your characters to experience this.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.290
For that emotional honesty.

11:18.290 --> 11:20.090
This is the only truth in our lives.

11:23.190 --> 11:24.435
Who's that buffoon?

11:24.435 --> 11:26.338
(intense music)

11:26.338 --> 11:28.378
Hey, what the fuck are you doing, asshole?

11:28.378 --> 11:29.555
- [Nilah] Hey, put her down!

11:29.555 --> 11:31.297
- [Claire] What is going on?

11:31.297 --> 11:33.464
(yelling)

11:40.393 --> 11:43.729
- That is not how it happened!

11:43.729 --> 11:44.810
- Win the mind game.

11:44.810 --> 11:45.773
Win the mind game.

11:46.824 --> 11:48.539
- I'm not cut out for this.

11:48.539 --> 11:49.372
- You the man!

11:49.372 --> 11:50.313
You the man's man!

11:50.313 --> 11:52.076
You the (speaking foreign language).

11:52.076 --> 11:53.493
- [Mr. Owl} ETA 30 seconds.

12:00.524 --> 12:02.253
- This is the only truth in our lives.

12:02.253 --> 12:04.434
You have to be like Herzog.

12:04.434 --> 12:05.923
- [Mr. Owl] Ah, yes.

12:05.923 --> 12:06.833
Herzog.

12:06.833 --> 12:08.583
- Who's this buffoon?

12:10.105 --> 12:12.272
(yelling)

12:16.027 --> 12:18.694
(intense music)

12:25.984 --> 12:27.182
- [Mr. Owl] Yes, sir, I know.

12:27.182 --> 12:30.100
Yes, but she would have
been another witness.

12:30.100 --> 12:31.430
Just some girl.

12:31.430 --> 12:32.490
More ransom, more leverage.

12:32.490 --> 12:33.323
It's a win-win.

12:36.110 --> 12:38.290
- How do you be like Herzog?

12:38.290 --> 12:39.460
- Piss off!

12:39.460 --> 12:40.950
- [Mr. Owl] Yes, do tell, Miss Adams.

12:40.950 --> 12:43.033
How is one to be like Herzog?

12:44.890 --> 12:46.553
- Always answer the boss!

12:47.497 --> 12:48.530
- To fight against the apparatus,

12:48.530 --> 12:49.790
the clichés, the structures.

12:49.790 --> 12:53.250
Be yourself, be original, take chances.

12:53.250 --> 12:54.380
- [Mr. Owl] Be yourself?

12:54.380 --> 12:55.293
Original?

12:56.440 --> 12:57.495
Like your last film?

12:57.495 --> 12:59.745
(laughing)

13:07.400 --> 13:08.740
- So sorry.

13:08.740 --> 13:10.440
I promise I won't let them hurt you.

13:10.440 --> 13:11.653
- Please protect us.

13:12.736 --> 13:14.016
(speaking foreign language)

13:14.016 --> 13:16.310
- You'll probably be back
in time for your speech.

13:16.310 --> 13:17.453
Eight o'clock, right?

13:18.450 --> 13:23.450
- Miss Adams, what did you
really mean by "be like Herzog"?

13:23.630 --> 13:24.523
- Not now.

13:25.490 --> 13:26.323
- Please.

13:26.323 --> 13:27.720
Mentoring will calm me.

13:27.720 --> 13:28.553
- Go your own way.

13:28.553 --> 13:31.080
Forget the three acts and the real plot.

13:31.080 --> 13:34.263
Discover your vantage
point and generate it.

13:35.130 --> 13:37.850
- Yeah, but I can't figure
out the screenwriting.

13:37.850 --> 13:39.730
I think I need a writing partner.

13:39.730 --> 13:42.640
- Yes, a writing partner!

13:42.640 --> 13:44.273
Don't you agree, Miss Adams?

13:49.714 --> 13:50.680
You still haven't told that one

13:50.680 --> 13:51.513
hush-hush.

13:55.030 --> 13:57.030
- This won't mean shit without a notary.

14:00.454 --> 14:02.044
- Shing!

14:02.044 --> 14:04.130
(sword clanks)

14:04.130 --> 14:05.710
- I told you not to bring it.

14:05.710 --> 14:08.060
Your core competency astounds me.

14:08.060 --> 14:11.070
You're gonna chop your fingers off, idiot!

14:11.070 --> 14:13.250
- I slipped.

14:13.250 --> 14:15.940
And, it's my talisman.

14:15.940 --> 14:18.210
- It has magic powers?

14:18.210 --> 14:19.276
Idiot!

14:19.276 --> 14:21.943
(muzak playing)

14:29.460 --> 14:31.580
- Can you believe she won that award?

14:31.580 --> 14:33.530
She's supposed to be a total bitch.

14:33.530 --> 14:34.770
- An auteur from hell.

14:34.770 --> 14:36.290
- Aren't they all?

14:36.290 --> 14:38.460
Heard she pulled a Herzog and exploited

14:38.460 --> 14:40.513
those Indians in Bolivia for a shot.

14:42.050 --> 14:42.883
- It was a good shot.

14:42.883 --> 14:46.820
- Yeah, she's a total badass.

14:46.820 --> 14:48.370
Can't wait to meet her tonight.

14:57.405 --> 14:59.988
(woman crying)

15:08.100 --> 15:08.933
- You okay?

15:10.463 --> 15:11.663
- [Woman] Yup, I'm fine.

15:13.341 --> 15:14.758
It's just that...

15:16.620 --> 15:18.170
- What's up?

15:18.170 --> 15:20.040
- [Woman] Just a bad day.

15:20.040 --> 15:23.190
I wish those girls had
been talking about me.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.853
Anybody to notice my work.

15:26.930 --> 15:30.223
He said, the director said I was poison.

15:31.950 --> 15:33.870
I want a rebirth.

15:33.870 --> 15:35.420
Not to be a better person.

15:35.420 --> 15:38.030
No, I'm selfish.

15:38.030 --> 15:40.383
I want to kick more butt.

15:55.240 --> 15:56.073
Wow.

16:11.630 --> 16:13.010
- Bastards!

16:13.010 --> 16:14.150
Just because you've been tracking me

16:14.150 --> 16:16.010
doesn't make you professionals.

16:16.010 --> 16:18.370
- [Mr. Owl] Do you take
such a crew for amateurs?

16:18.370 --> 16:20.133
- Your gun's not even loaded.

16:23.110 --> 16:24.760
- [Mr. Owl] Time's up, Mr. Raven.

16:27.150 --> 16:29.090
- I'm depressed.

16:29.090 --> 16:30.340
Feels kinda like the flu.

16:31.591 --> 16:32.670
- It's the keto-flu.

16:32.670 --> 16:33.630
Up your hydration.

16:33.630 --> 16:35.820
Hell, upgrade hydration.

16:35.820 --> 16:38.113
Pace yourself, it's an athletic workout.

16:39.530 --> 16:41.493
The real stress is about to begin.

16:43.640 --> 16:45.550
- It's so complex.

16:45.550 --> 16:46.383
Convoluted.

16:46.383 --> 16:47.760
The whole plan.

16:47.760 --> 16:49.760
- Do whatever it takes to get the money.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.460
- No, I mean figuring out
if I've had too many carbs.

16:53.460 --> 16:55.520
- All that matters is
the mission statement

16:55.520 --> 16:56.663
you give to the body.

16:59.167 --> 17:00.820
- What are you doing?

17:00.820 --> 17:01.710
The agreement was--

17:01.710 --> 17:02.543
- Don't worry.

17:02.543 --> 17:03.376
Blanks.

17:11.830 --> 17:13.530
- Hey, yo, careful.

17:13.530 --> 17:15.480
Remember Hexum in the 80s?

17:15.480 --> 17:17.380
He played Russian roulette with blanks.

17:17.380 --> 17:18.323
Did not end well.

17:20.557 --> 17:21.720
(breathing heavily)

17:21.720 --> 17:24.820
- Sorry, it'll be over soon enough.

17:24.820 --> 17:27.090
Don't let them get to your heads.

17:27.090 --> 17:29.040
They're just playing out their clichés.

17:29.980 --> 17:31.550
- Clichés?

17:31.550 --> 17:34.530
- You know, the driver's the
loco producer in the outfit.

17:34.530 --> 17:39.000
The archetypal warrior
father trickster shaman guy.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.080
Joseph Campbell deep caca.

17:41.080 --> 17:42.330
You know his stuff, right?

17:42.330 --> 17:43.880
- What do you mean, "producer"?

17:48.280 --> 17:50.050
- They changed the deadline?

17:50.050 --> 17:51.300
- No.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.323
Must be finished by tomorrow.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.570
- We can do it.

17:55.570 --> 17:58.470
They don't need a final version,
just something watchable.

17:59.610 --> 18:01.050
Something's not in alignment, though.

18:01.050 --> 18:02.840
The ending's not earned somehow.

18:02.840 --> 18:03.930
- He's wrong.

18:03.930 --> 18:05.400
His notes are wrong.

18:05.400 --> 18:06.790
I told him the hero should save

18:06.790 --> 18:08.840
an injured possum on page two.

18:08.840 --> 18:10.490
The audience would have loved it.

18:12.560 --> 18:14.020
- You're sweating.

18:14.020 --> 18:15.410
A lot.

18:15.410 --> 18:17.603
- What is Pigeon guy doing?

18:18.560 --> 18:19.793
- He's, uh ...

18:22.200 --> 18:23.753
researching the next project.

18:25.610 --> 18:27.735
Not doing a good job of it.

18:27.735 --> 18:28.735
- You can do better?

18:29.970 --> 18:32.037
- What do you mean by "crazy producer"?

18:39.798 --> 18:42.048
(groaning)

18:44.460 --> 18:46.180
- You know the great
thing about fitness is?

18:46.180 --> 18:47.860
About eating right?

18:47.860 --> 18:50.133
The end always justifies the means.

18:52.249 --> 18:54.499
(coughing)

18:59.641 --> 19:01.772
- Hey!

19:01.772 --> 19:04.296
(coughing)

19:04.296 --> 19:07.963
(shouting foreign language)

19:10.412 --> 19:11.360
- Hey.

19:11.360 --> 19:12.193
Hey.

19:12.193 --> 19:13.170
- Is he, uh ...

19:13.170 --> 19:14.880
(speaking foreign language)

19:14.880 --> 19:15.713
- Almost.

19:16.730 --> 19:18.440
- He's been fasting for a month.

19:18.440 --> 19:20.510
It must be that high-fat,
low-carb diet you have him on.

19:20.510 --> 19:21.820
- Shut the fuck up, idiot!

19:21.820 --> 19:23.260
- He had one of those
heart attack seizures

19:23.260 --> 19:24.910
from all the butter you force fed him.

19:24.910 --> 19:26.446
- Pigeon!

19:26.446 --> 19:27.400
Pigeon!

19:27.400 --> 19:28.483
Oh no, oh no!

20:10.210 --> 20:12.360
- Miss Adams, let's just be respectful

20:12.360 --> 20:13.590
and we won't get hurt.

20:13.590 --> 20:16.474
- Fucking dilettantes don't
know what they're doing.

20:16.474 --> 20:18.724
(coughing)

20:22.960 --> 20:24.600
- Let me take him to the ER.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.063
- No hospitals!

20:27.930 --> 20:29.533
Take him to Doctor Zhivago.

20:41.571 --> 20:44.070
- I wonder what happened
to that Pigeon guy.

20:44.070 --> 20:45.815
His lips were awfully red.

20:45.815 --> 20:48.494
- Shh!

20:48.494 --> 20:49.900
- [Nilah] You focusing
your creative energies?

20:49.900 --> 20:52.550
- My career lives and
dies by tonight's speech.

20:52.550 --> 20:54.610
My investors will be there.

20:54.610 --> 20:55.443
- Don't say that.

20:55.443 --> 20:57.060
You're brilliant.

20:57.060 --> 20:58.210
- I'm broke.

20:58.210 --> 20:59.370
In debt.

20:59.370 --> 21:01.103
My films aren't mainstream.

21:05.490 --> 21:08.840
- [Nilah] Why not make a genre picture?

21:08.840 --> 21:09.890
- Never.

21:09.890 --> 21:11.370
- [Nilah] Can't never could, Miss Adams.

21:11.370 --> 21:13.960
- You will never catch
me in a genre picture.

21:13.960 --> 21:14.960
They are the soul-sucking,

21:14.960 --> 21:16.620
money-making vehicle of the studios.

21:16.620 --> 21:17.890
I'm no stooge.

21:17.890 --> 21:20.053
So it's literally over my dead body.

21:22.540 --> 21:25.190
- [Nilah] My English teacher
would say "metaphorically".

21:25.190 --> 21:26.850
- I'm not talking
metaphors, or allegories,

21:26.850 --> 21:28.503
or even creating an adumbration.

21:30.459 --> 21:31.740
- [Nilah] Adumbration?

21:31.740 --> 21:33.943
- Figures of speech, foreshadowing.

21:36.055 --> 21:38.888
(energetic music)

21:59.999 --> 22:02.249
(coughing)

22:05.750 --> 22:07.140
- Is he ..

22:07.140 --> 22:07.973
Is he alive?

22:09.360 --> 22:10.193
- Let's go.

22:10.193 --> 22:11.560
Hate Doctor Zhivago.

22:11.560 --> 22:12.393
- Did you do it?

22:13.370 --> 22:14.830
- He did it to himself.

22:14.830 --> 22:19.380
Bacon n' eggs, bacon almond
flour muffins, bacon smoothies.

22:19.380 --> 22:21.200
I bet it was Boss Man.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.033
- No.

22:22.033 --> 22:24.120
No, it was that slut from the caterer.

22:24.120 --> 22:26.570
You murdered him because
he cheated on you.

22:26.570 --> 22:29.140
- You killed him because
he insulted your writing.

22:29.140 --> 22:32.250
- He doesn't know what real art is!

22:32.250 --> 22:33.340
- And, yes, he lied.

22:33.340 --> 22:37.083
Yes, he was unfaithful, but
that don't make me an assassin.

22:38.140 --> 22:40.933
Boss Man thought he was the weak link.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.613
- He never would have talked.

22:49.700 --> 22:51.930
- Shit, I can't pee!

22:51.930 --> 22:53.240
- What are we doing?

22:53.240 --> 22:55.920
- We pee on the newspaper before folding.

22:55.920 --> 22:58.540
- Miss Adams, why would
we do such a thing?

22:58.540 --> 23:00.610
- Remember my movie in Bolivia?

23:00.610 --> 23:02.360
- The Masks of Mrs. Jones.

23:02.360 --> 23:04.350
The one where the prisoners sell curses

23:04.350 --> 23:06.410
to bring jazz to the other inmates?

23:06.410 --> 23:09.160
- One woman told me
about the Seaside Brick.

23:09.160 --> 23:11.150
- [Narrator] I wanted to say
it was my favorite movie,

23:11.150 --> 23:12.510
but was self-conscious.

23:12.510 --> 23:14.390
- You're making a weapon.

23:14.390 --> 23:17.370
- Before they had easy
access to knives and guns.

23:17.370 --> 23:19.380
- Look, I'm dry.

23:19.380 --> 23:22.060
Except for code red down
there, if you know what I mean.

23:22.060 --> 23:23.490
- Hand it over.

23:23.490 --> 23:24.340
- [Nilah] Hand what over?

23:24.340 --> 23:25.453
- Your tampon.

23:26.430 --> 23:27.443
- That's not right.

23:28.410 --> 23:31.500
- Directors dream, directors do.

23:31.500 --> 23:34.870
We pick locks, shoot
without permits, steal.

23:34.870 --> 23:36.800
- And make your own weapons?

23:36.800 --> 23:38.160
- Don't you want to be a filmmaker?

23:38.160 --> 23:39.370
- [Narrator] It was unfair.

23:39.370 --> 23:41.000
She had me.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.250
I knew she was right.

23:42.250 --> 23:44.360
- This has nothing to do with that.

23:44.360 --> 23:46.730
- Hand over your fucking
tampon or I'll hold you down

23:46.730 --> 23:48.813
and uncork you like a bottle of wine!

23:51.350 --> 23:52.183
- Turn around.

24:07.070 --> 24:09.487
(girl moans)

24:16.060 --> 24:16.893
Ready.

24:18.320 --> 24:20.160
(chuckles)

24:20.160 --> 24:21.070
- What?

24:21.070 --> 24:22.050
You wear pads?

24:22.050 --> 24:23.053
Brilliant.

24:28.442 --> 24:30.775
(squirting)

24:33.752 --> 24:36.502
(crumples paper)

24:38.058 --> 24:39.475
- [Nilah] Oh, God.

24:41.884 --> 24:43.210
- Alright, tape.

24:43.210 --> 24:44.060
Where's the tape?

24:53.599 --> 24:54.432
Shh.

25:13.152 --> 25:15.020
(exhaling)

25:15.020 --> 25:16.920
- Did you kill Mr. Pigeon?

25:16.920 --> 25:18.920
You don't take notes very well.

25:18.920 --> 25:20.300
- No!

25:20.300 --> 25:21.450
What do you think I am?

25:22.710 --> 25:24.400
Claire must have done it.

25:24.400 --> 25:27.060
She hates interns just as
much as script readers.

25:27.060 --> 25:30.010
- Claire doesn't know if he's
a script reader or an intern.

25:31.320 --> 25:32.870
Be a good move, professionally.

25:34.023 --> 25:36.500
- I hate script readers
and their silly notes.

25:36.500 --> 25:37.333
- I know.

25:38.210 --> 25:39.950
I just don't think now is the time

25:39.950 --> 25:41.783
to be exterminating the team.

25:43.470 --> 25:45.180
- Mr. Emu did it.

25:45.180 --> 25:48.613
He actually wants the job. (chuckles)

26:01.140 --> 26:03.010
- Mr. Pigeon alive?

26:03.010 --> 26:04.860
- Maybe food poisoning.

26:04.860 --> 26:07.600
- From eating broccoli
sauteed in olive oil?

26:07.600 --> 26:09.193
- [Mrs. Hawk] I'm brainstorming.

26:14.058 --> 26:16.391
(splashing)

26:18.164 --> 26:20.160
(mug shattering)

26:20.160 --> 26:21.400
- Listen up.

26:21.400 --> 26:26.400
Under the contract, Mr.
Pigeon surrenders his credits.

26:27.130 --> 26:29.210
That allocates his credits to you

26:29.210 --> 26:34.090
and grants full producer status.

26:34.090 --> 26:35.540
- Sweet!

26:35.540 --> 26:38.360
- What's the best way to
spend the ransom money?

26:38.360 --> 26:40.780
Let's rehire that badass editor.

26:40.780 --> 26:42.020
- Color correction.

26:42.020 --> 26:43.540
- Sound design.

26:43.540 --> 26:45.420
It's all about the audio.

26:45.420 --> 26:47.300
- It's a visual medium.

26:47.300 --> 26:49.500
Spend it on the visuals.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.110
- There's a time crunch.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.970
We'll be switching around a few scenes.

26:52.970 --> 26:56.810
Otherwise, everything goes to
post audio and deliverables.

26:56.810 --> 26:58.883
20 hours to fix the edit!

26:59.858 --> 27:01.320
Ah, fuck it.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.713
Read me his notes.

27:08.051 --> 27:09.200
(speaking foreign language)

27:09.200 --> 27:10.440
- [Mr. Emu] Add flashback sequences

27:10.440 --> 27:11.660
to bring tension to dialogue.

27:11.660 --> 27:12.878
- Did you hear that?

27:12.878 --> 27:13.900
(speaking in foreign language)

27:13.900 --> 27:16.702
- Add voiceover to extend
movie to 90 minutes.

27:16.702 --> 27:17.700
(speaking in foreign language)

27:17.700 --> 27:20.293
Add ticking clock to ramp up the stakes.

27:23.020 --> 27:23.853
(bangs door)

27:23.853 --> 27:26.337
- [Claire] Fucking knew it.

27:26.337 --> 27:27.270
You can't do it.

27:27.270 --> 27:28.190
- Do what?

27:28.190 --> 27:30.340
- A group of producers
kidnaps a director for money?

27:30.340 --> 27:32.613
I don't even have money, you fuck twads.

27:32.613 --> 27:34.343
- What about mommy's 30,000?

27:35.460 --> 27:36.870
- What?

27:36.870 --> 27:37.703
No.

27:37.703 --> 27:38.900
You leave her out of this.

27:38.900 --> 27:41.500
- Your mother finances your movies?

27:41.500 --> 27:42.470
- Oh, you didn't know?

27:42.470 --> 27:44.630
Her films don't generate any money.

27:44.630 --> 27:47.330
Lucky for us, little
mommy resides in Oakland.

27:47.330 --> 27:49.063
- The wheels are already turning.

27:51.340 --> 27:52.960
- Nice try.

27:52.960 --> 27:54.210
A ticking clock?

27:54.210 --> 27:55.610
Flashbacks?

27:55.610 --> 27:57.200
Are you listening to this, Nilah?

27:57.200 --> 27:59.083
Your characters carry the story.

28:00.260 --> 28:03.040
Hey, I got a stellar idea.

28:03.040 --> 28:06.010
How about you acquire
a huge fucking clock,

28:06.010 --> 28:07.673
hang it up in the background?

28:08.890 --> 28:12.440
I spit on your boorish
and hackneyed ideas.

28:12.440 --> 28:14.260
(spits)

28:14.260 --> 28:16.600
- You told her to be like Herzog.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.550
We are like Herzog.

28:18.550 --> 28:20.100
We are Fitzcarraldo.

28:20.100 --> 28:23.550
We are in the kidnapping
business to make movies.

28:23.550 --> 28:25.810
- Finish your film at all cost.

28:25.810 --> 28:30.540
Hell, kill a few Indians, drown
a few little tiny primates,

28:30.540 --> 28:32.063
take a bullet if you have too.

28:33.080 --> 28:37.200
Find the Machiavelli
inspiration deep inside you.

28:37.200 --> 28:39.690
Don't be nice, be productive.

28:39.690 --> 28:43.100
Don't be noble, be impressive.

28:43.100 --> 28:44.910
- I know you.

28:44.910 --> 28:46.643
I'm going to find you out.

28:48.030 --> 28:49.440
- Really?

28:49.440 --> 28:52.043
Well, Claire, what do
you think about this?

28:54.530 --> 28:55.680
- Why do you have that?

28:56.631 --> 28:58.210
- It's a reminder.

28:58.210 --> 28:59.830
For team play.

28:59.830 --> 29:00.943
For cooperation.

29:03.450 --> 29:06.320
- You haven't earned
the right to make films!

29:06.320 --> 29:07.940
You will never make another movie

29:07.940 --> 29:10.350
unless it's about you taking it up the ass

29:10.350 --> 29:13.260
from your giant cellmate
on security footage

29:13.260 --> 29:16.163
sent to your fucking mother,
you bird-face motherfucker!

29:17.245 --> 29:18.790
You producers are all the same!

29:18.790 --> 29:21.750
I'm going to take my
Independent Courage Award

29:21.750 --> 29:26.043
and personally shove it up
your bureaucratic apparatus!

29:27.130 --> 29:29.923
- It's the Independent
Bravery Award, Miss Adams.

29:32.216 --> 29:34.440
(kicks door)

29:34.440 --> 29:35.568
- Field trip.

29:35.568 --> 29:37.568
(claps)

29:43.290 --> 29:44.790
- May I approach the Boss Man?

29:53.030 --> 29:55.130
Excuse me, Mr. Boss Man.

29:55.130 --> 29:57.330
Any chance you're looking
to hire a director

29:57.330 --> 30:00.060
or someone who can help with the edit?

30:00.060 --> 30:02.810
- [Mr. Owl] This is my
kidnapping, not a job interview.

30:04.880 --> 30:05.713
Get back.

30:07.700 --> 30:08.970
What?

30:08.970 --> 30:10.210
Jesus.

30:10.210 --> 30:11.463
- I can run errands too.

30:12.760 --> 30:15.700
- [Mr. Owl] Look, keep
your mentor in line.

30:15.700 --> 30:17.290
When this all blows over, I'll send you

30:17.290 --> 30:19.820
a job through one of my contacts.

30:19.820 --> 30:20.653
- Soon.

30:20.653 --> 30:21.486
- [Mr. Owl] Sure, sure.

30:21.486 --> 30:22.460
- I need money.

30:22.460 --> 30:23.293
For my movie.

30:33.620 --> 30:34.830
- What was that about?

30:34.830 --> 30:36.437
- [Mr. Emu] She asked to use
(speaking in foreign language).

30:40.830 --> 30:41.910
- We can escape easy.

30:41.910 --> 30:44.680
First I gotta figure out
out who these producers are.

30:44.680 --> 30:45.645
- No.

30:45.645 --> 30:48.330
If we don't see their faces, we'll live.

30:48.330 --> 30:50.643
- It's a matter of principle.

30:50.643 --> 30:52.365
When it happens, just sit tight.

30:52.365 --> 30:55.198
(energetic music)

31:22.209 --> 31:25.673
(van doors opening)

31:25.673 --> 31:26.506
No, no way.

31:26.506 --> 31:27.339
I refuse.

31:27.339 --> 31:28.172
- [Mr. Owl] You have no choice.

31:28.172 --> 31:30.900
Otherwise, she joins the party.

31:30.900 --> 31:32.100
- A little old lady won't understand.

31:32.100 --> 31:33.650
You'll give her a heart attack.

31:37.090 --> 31:41.700
- Claire, thy appearance
bethinks a longing of lost love.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.543
How I do suffer so.

31:45.553 --> 31:46.856
- Does look good, doesn't it?

31:46.856 --> 31:48.989
- Don't even think about it.

31:48.989 --> 31:50.790
- A joyous coincidence.

31:50.790 --> 31:52.970
For doth the previous
troupe content themselves

31:52.970 --> 31:55.410
with the prat of
schoolchildren and beshrews

31:55.410 --> 31:58.020
my feast of boar and pots of ale.

31:58.020 --> 31:58.853
- Ma, please.

31:58.853 --> 32:00.263
Enough.

32:00.263 --> 32:01.740
- Are doth afeard of my presence?

32:01.740 --> 32:03.000
- Let's get to the point.

32:03.000 --> 32:03.833
I was hoping--

32:03.833 --> 32:08.590
- I notice a base and unworthy
lot becomes my humble abode.

32:09.550 --> 32:11.900
Why doth the brave
masquerade about and such?

32:11.900 --> 32:13.170
- They're method actors.

32:13.170 --> 32:14.770
We start shooting on the morrow.

32:15.801 --> 32:16.950
(clears throat) Tomorrow.

32:16.950 --> 32:18.820
In fact, we're here to
ask for an investment

32:18.820 --> 32:20.020
to help finish the film.

32:21.280 --> 32:22.230
- Eat.

32:22.230 --> 32:23.513
Devour.

32:24.620 --> 32:25.673
- Sorry, ma'am.

32:26.730 --> 32:31.730
The team's credo is paleo for
life and strength in ketosis.

32:32.800 --> 32:34.216
- Blasphemy.

32:34.216 --> 32:38.020
Do you dare chide my being
to undone my generosity?

32:38.020 --> 32:38.853
- Enough.

32:38.853 --> 32:39.686
Stop.

32:39.686 --> 32:40.800
Talk normal.

32:40.800 --> 32:42.093
- About that investment.

32:43.570 --> 32:46.540
- I'm sorry to be asking
this, but can I have

32:46.540 --> 32:48.823
the 30,000 you promised me last year?

33:03.790 --> 33:05.910
You still keep cash in the house?

33:05.910 --> 33:09.310
- I am not going to entrust
suited crooks with my 30,000.

33:09.310 --> 33:11.250
- You have the money here?

33:11.250 --> 33:12.780
- Must be in the suitcase, jefe.

33:12.780 --> 33:14.300
- Did I mention Claire that I divided

33:14.300 --> 33:16.160
the 30,000 among your brothers?

33:16.160 --> 33:19.709
Your films are too heady,
a terrible investment.

33:19.709 --> 33:20.673
- What?

33:20.673 --> 33:22.550
- Is the money in the suitcase?

33:22.550 --> 33:24.162
- Of course it is.

33:24.162 --> 33:26.080
- You contradict yourself!

33:26.080 --> 33:28.250
- I taught her everything she knows

33:28.250 --> 33:30.080
about acting, about narrative.

33:30.080 --> 33:32.740
Is this how I'm rewarded?

33:32.740 --> 33:34.220
Oh, what is ketosis?

33:34.220 --> 33:36.130
A paleo diet?

33:36.130 --> 33:41.040
- No grains, low
carbohydrates, lots of fats.

33:41.040 --> 33:41.873
- What?

33:41.873 --> 33:43.773
- Your body burns fat for fuel.

33:45.120 --> 33:47.650
- Is this part of your
method or are you on drugs?

33:47.650 --> 33:50.910
Grains are the essence of civilization.

33:50.910 --> 33:52.100
- [Mrs. Hawk] Grains are unhealthy.

33:52.100 --> 33:54.520
- You can't feed the
people without grains,

33:54.520 --> 33:55.800
you bourgeois cunt.

33:55.800 --> 33:57.862
- Don't call me bourgeoisi

33:57.862 --> 33:58.720
(grunts)

33:58.720 --> 34:00.990
- Your mother is brilliant.

34:00.990 --> 34:02.610
- Fuck me, not you too.

34:04.405 --> 34:06.822
(whimpering)

34:09.648 --> 34:10.780
- Tell her to get up.

34:10.780 --> 34:11.630
Make her stop.

34:12.766 --> 34:13.599
- Shing!

34:16.360 --> 34:19.180
- [Mr. Owl] Where we at with
that suitcase, Mrs. Hawk?

34:19.180 --> 34:20.090
- It's jammed.

34:20.090 --> 34:21.120
I couldn't get it.

34:21.120 --> 34:21.953
- Don't worry.

34:21.953 --> 34:22.923
I'm sure the money's in there.

34:22.923 --> 34:24.650
If your mother promised it and all.

34:24.650 --> 34:26.790
Hey no one really got
hurt, so that's something.

34:26.790 --> 34:28.720
- [Mr. Owl] What was the name of that film

34:28.720 --> 34:30.830
she did two years ago?

34:30.830 --> 34:33.430
- The Masked Mrs. Jones.

34:33.430 --> 34:35.800
- Ah yes, Mrs. Jone's Masks.

34:35.800 --> 34:38.380
500 minutes I will never get back.

34:38.380 --> 34:40.460
- Do you remember what
you said when you made it?

34:40.460 --> 34:42.140
About freedom and obstacles?

34:42.140 --> 34:43.607
- Technically nobody ever gets back--

34:43.607 --> 34:46.900
- [Nilah] "Always destroy what is within."

34:46.900 --> 34:48.070
Then you'll be free.

34:48.070 --> 34:49.170
Hell, when life gives you mangoes,

34:49.170 --> 34:51.070
make mango-naid.
- You've seen it?

34:51.070 --> 34:52.090
- [Mr. Owl] Finished it.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.260
Like my first marathon.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.930
- Hey, Mr. Owl, you leave her alone.

34:56.930 --> 34:59.860
That stands alone as a brave
piece of art representing

34:59.860 --> 35:02.472
the fluidity of the plight
of the postmodern woman.

35:02.472 --> 35:05.360
(giggling)

35:05.360 --> 35:08.887
- Miss Nilah, your mentor
has no idea, does she?

35:08.887 --> 35:11.554
(phone ringing)

35:12.400 --> 35:13.550
No idea.

35:13.550 --> 35:15.433
- She got no idea.

35:20.300 --> 35:21.133
- [Mr. Owl] Hello?

35:21.133 --> 35:22.410
- It's El Boss Man.

35:22.410 --> 35:23.670
The chief.

35:23.670 --> 35:24.503
The head producer.

35:24.503 --> 35:25.336
Mr. Foreboding.

35:25.336 --> 35:26.300
- [Mr. Owl] Yes, sir.

35:26.300 --> 35:27.133
I understand.

35:27.133 --> 35:28.630
- He's talking about post-production.

35:28.630 --> 35:30.090
That's when you finish principle--

35:30.090 --> 35:32.590
- Oh Jesus fucking Christ, we
know what post-production is!

35:32.590 --> 35:34.367
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

35:34.367 --> 35:35.200
You're right.

35:35.200 --> 35:36.600
- [Mr. Owl] I understand, visual medium,

35:36.600 --> 35:38.610
but the audio is problematic.

35:38.610 --> 35:40.230
No.

35:40.230 --> 35:41.464
Fine.

35:41.464 --> 35:42.514
I'll get right on it.

35:44.650 --> 35:47.450
Visual medium doesn't
fucking mean anything!

35:47.450 --> 35:48.896
- Told you!

35:48.896 --> 35:49.772
Wouldn't listen.

35:49.772 --> 35:50.689
(shouts)

35:50.689 --> 35:53.356
(intense music)

36:00.544 --> 36:02.294
- Oh god, my fingers!

36:12.387 --> 36:14.554
(moaning)

36:28.800 --> 36:29.633
- Her fingers!

36:36.910 --> 36:38.140
- Demoted.

36:38.140 --> 36:40.466
Associate Producer.

36:40.466 --> 36:41.299
Maybe.

36:49.366 --> 36:51.533
(moaning)

37:50.540 --> 37:52.740
- Not to be disrespectful...

37:52.740 --> 37:54.040
- But.

37:54.040 --> 37:56.680
- But you should treat
the bird people better.

37:56.680 --> 37:59.500
I don't want them to put the rape on us.

37:59.500 --> 38:00.950
What about the money?

38:00.950 --> 38:03.180
- My mom gave it to my brothers.

38:03.180 --> 38:04.570
- What if you're wrong?

38:04.570 --> 38:07.820
Let's settle in and
let it work itself out.

38:07.820 --> 38:08.870
- Forget the politeness.

38:08.870 --> 38:11.410
Stop with the "Yes, Miss Adams."

38:11.410 --> 38:13.140
Think of yourself, no, sculpt yourself

38:13.140 --> 38:15.373
into boldness verging on arrogance.

38:17.520 --> 38:19.709
- Hey, that ostrich man can protect us!

38:19.709 --> 38:20.840
- Forget ...

38:20.840 --> 38:22.560
Forget the Emu!

38:22.560 --> 38:23.420
They're novices.

38:23.420 --> 38:24.480
Listen to my words.

38:24.480 --> 38:26.913
I need your inner bitch to come out!

38:31.520 --> 38:32.773
Motherfucking jackpot!

38:40.280 --> 38:42.530
(grunting)

38:54.690 --> 38:55.650
- I can't.

38:55.650 --> 38:56.970
I'm feeling sick again.

38:56.970 --> 38:58.510
- You got this.

38:58.510 --> 39:01.520
I'm telling you, just consume more fat.

39:01.520 --> 39:03.490
It's liquid synergy.

39:03.490 --> 39:06.493
Your body wants ketosis.

39:08.200 --> 39:09.840
- I'm worthless.

39:09.840 --> 39:11.740
- What's ketosis again?

39:11.740 --> 39:14.610
- Mr. Glucose Storage
Factory, shut the fuck up.

39:14.610 --> 39:16.280
- At least tell me what Plan B is.

39:16.280 --> 39:17.573
- Fuck Plan B.

39:18.410 --> 39:20.160
What happened to Mr. Pigeon?

39:20.160 --> 39:21.160
Did you hurt him?

39:21.160 --> 39:22.573
Just to be script reader?

39:26.280 --> 39:28.050
What are you thinking?

39:28.050 --> 39:29.400
Keep it on.

39:29.400 --> 39:31.480
Stay in character.

39:31.480 --> 39:32.830
There's cameras everywhere.

39:41.960 --> 39:44.210
(drilling)

39:53.392 --> 39:55.023
- I feel a tad woozy.

39:56.360 --> 39:57.810
Think you can get me a job?

39:57.810 --> 39:58.793
I'm a hard worker.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.480
I don't think those producers

40:01.480 --> 40:04.260
will hire me anymore after the maiming.

40:04.260 --> 40:05.940
- When we get out of
here, escape the madness,

40:05.940 --> 40:07.870
trust me, the movie business' main problem

40:07.870 --> 40:09.363
is that it's about business.

40:13.840 --> 40:17.930
Oh, fuck me, what the fuck?

40:17.930 --> 40:20.003
- Oh no, oh no no, Miss Adams.

40:20.850 --> 40:22.033
I ate too much bread.

40:23.990 --> 40:24.823
Oh Miss--

40:25.810 --> 40:26.653
- Hey, hey, hey.

40:28.780 --> 40:30.230
It's okay, when we get
outside I'll carry you.

40:30.230 --> 40:32.544
- It's all right, I feel better now.

40:32.544 --> 40:33.427
Those damn star--

40:34.628 --> 40:35.653
- Oh fuck.

40:41.390 --> 40:42.223
- [Mrs. Hawk] How's he doing?

40:42.223 --> 40:44.043
- It appears he was poisoned.

40:50.350 --> 40:52.400
- Okay, lesbians and gaffers,

40:52.400 --> 40:54.890
the time you've been
waiting for has arrived.

40:54.890 --> 40:57.670
- I present to you in
glorious, non-anamorphic

40:57.670 --> 41:02.220
four-by-three, Mrs. Jones Masks!

41:02.220 --> 41:03.693
- The Masks of Mrs. Jones.

41:06.847 --> 41:08.480
- Ugh!

41:08.480 --> 41:10.097
Can you make it?

41:10.097 --> 41:11.720
500 more minutes.

41:11.720 --> 41:16.720
How does a film like this get
financed without distribution?

41:16.869 --> 41:17.830
(phone ringing)

41:17.830 --> 41:19.753
Oh, that's right, little mommy helps.

41:32.350 --> 41:33.410
Yes, sir.

41:33.410 --> 41:36.320
The mother is collecting
the money from the brothers.

41:36.320 --> 41:38.570
Yes, she knows about
the sensitive situation.

41:39.480 --> 41:42.190
The money will be here within the hour.

41:42.190 --> 41:43.023
Sir?

41:44.090 --> 41:45.580
Yes, I already called them.

41:45.580 --> 41:48.623
I know, color correction, a visual medium.

41:50.750 --> 41:52.310
What?

41:52.310 --> 41:53.143
Are you sure?

41:54.550 --> 41:57.107
Wait, you want me to do what to her?

42:04.746 --> 42:06.247
- My boo boo.

42:06.247 --> 42:08.253
Who did this to you?

42:09.280 --> 42:10.520
Who's next?

42:10.520 --> 42:12.563
- That flightless bastard did it.

42:13.800 --> 42:14.750
He told you, right?

42:15.620 --> 42:17.140
It's a lie.

42:17.140 --> 42:17.973
He wants you.

42:17.973 --> 42:19.860
He poisoned me to get to you.

42:19.860 --> 42:20.693
- What?

42:21.690 --> 42:23.060
- I never cheated on you.

42:23.060 --> 42:23.970
Never.

42:23.970 --> 42:25.380
I may have flirted with her.

42:25.380 --> 42:26.439
But that's it.

42:26.439 --> 42:28.826
- Bastard!

42:28.826 --> 42:30.540
My bastard.

42:31.770 --> 42:33.010
- Listen.

42:33.010 --> 42:35.410
We still have time to fix
this film in the edit.

42:36.510 --> 42:37.817
- How, like how?

42:37.817 --> 42:40.210
- Well it's like sex.

42:40.210 --> 42:45.100
A little foreplay, stick it
in there, and make some noise.

42:45.100 --> 42:49.507
Then you escalate, escalate,
escalate until-- (coughing)

42:51.751 --> 42:52.584
- Until?

42:52.584 --> 42:53.417
Until?

42:53.417 --> 42:56.190
- Until the ending, the climax.

42:56.190 --> 42:57.263
Cut to credits.

42:58.550 --> 42:59.853
It's all about the ending.

43:01.660 --> 43:03.633
- Boss Man did this.

43:05.620 --> 43:07.270
- He thinks I'm weak.

43:07.270 --> 43:08.480
- You're not weak.

43:08.480 --> 43:10.423
You're accommodating.

43:11.800 --> 43:14.220
Mr. Raven hated your notes.

43:14.220 --> 43:17.500
- I only suggested more
conflict, more violence!

43:17.500 --> 43:19.123
That's no reason to kill me!

43:26.910 --> 43:29.753
- What did you do to Mr. Pigeon?

43:31.144 --> 43:33.843
First Yonnie, now the intern!

43:36.510 --> 43:38.277
Tell me about Yonnie.

43:39.578 --> 43:40.810
Tell me.

43:40.810 --> 43:43.633
Tell me now, or she loses an ear.

43:44.830 --> 43:46.090
- Oh no.

43:46.090 --> 43:47.370
No, no, no, no.

43:47.370 --> 43:48.340
Miss Adams?

43:48.340 --> 43:49.540
Claire.

43:49.540 --> 43:50.650
- Tell you what about Yonnie?

43:50.650 --> 43:51.640
Tell you what?

43:51.640 --> 43:52.740
I'll tell you anything.

43:52.740 --> 43:53.890
- Oh crap, Miss Adams!

43:53.890 --> 43:55.723
- About how you stole his script.

43:56.600 --> 43:59.363
About how none of your work is original.

44:02.044 --> 44:02.877
(sword clangs)

44:02.877 --> 44:04.440
(shrieks)

44:04.440 --> 44:06.500
- What the fuck did you do?

44:06.500 --> 44:07.333
- Oh shit.

44:08.682 --> 44:10.932
(grunting)

44:25.220 --> 44:27.220
(yells)

44:54.260 --> 44:56.550
- [Narrator] My dear congregation ...

44:56.550 --> 44:59.210
have you ever hit a
low, had the bottom out,

44:59.210 --> 45:03.540
been unmoored and cast out to sea?

45:03.540 --> 45:04.503
What to do?

45:05.749 --> 45:07.930
- You have to destroy what's inside you.

45:07.930 --> 45:10.080
You must embrace the crazy.

45:10.080 --> 45:12.210
- [Narrator] Embrace the crazy.

45:12.210 --> 45:15.070
- You have to dig deeper,
get inside darker.

45:15.070 --> 45:16.410
Be in the here and now.

45:16.410 --> 45:18.710
- [Narrator] Be the now.

45:18.710 --> 45:20.960
- I have to follow dreams to
the end, through the struggles.

45:20.960 --> 45:23.680
There is a wildness in
the air that we breathe.

45:23.680 --> 45:24.690
Through all of it.

45:24.690 --> 45:26.170
To get the stuff that's inside.

45:26.170 --> 45:30.670
I am this wildness, I
must be the wildness.

45:30.670 --> 45:33.123
- [Narrator] Be the wildness.

45:38.955 --> 45:42.032
- Good god, this is appalling.

45:42.032 --> 45:45.199
(imitates gun firing)

45:46.440 --> 45:47.670
- You leave her alone.

45:47.670 --> 45:49.850
Claire is an artist.

45:49.850 --> 45:52.130
A brilliant, lone wolf
on the festival circuit

45:52.130 --> 45:54.380
who emits courage through her ...

45:54.380 --> 45:55.360
- Bravery.

45:55.360 --> 45:57.630
- Who emits bravery through
the greatest frickin'

45:57.630 --> 46:01.190
artistic medium of all time,
the goddamn moving picture.

46:01.190 --> 46:02.023
- Sit down.

46:02.023 --> 46:02.860
You'll be alright.

46:02.860 --> 46:05.360
- [Narrator] How can one
unshackle their minds, themselves?

46:05.360 --> 46:09.313
What holds them back from
attaining the purity, the freedom?

46:09.313 --> 46:11.470
(clapping)

46:11.470 --> 46:14.660
- Little Nilah, poor girl from Georgia.

46:14.660 --> 46:17.070
How did you ever get so far?

46:17.070 --> 46:18.640
- Calm down.

46:18.640 --> 46:19.890
How about another lesson?

46:20.770 --> 46:23.720
- You gonna tell her
your eensy-teensy secret?

46:23.720 --> 46:25.510
Yeah, not cool.

46:25.510 --> 46:26.993
- It's hard being famous.

46:27.850 --> 46:32.170
- I have no idea, strange
Owl man, what it is you mean.

46:32.170 --> 46:34.730
In Georgia, we'd say you're
meaner than a wet panther,

46:34.730 --> 46:38.340
but the bird-cat analogy
confusion would get in the way.

46:38.340 --> 46:41.320
- Birds of prey have excellent eyesight.

46:41.320 --> 46:45.410
The black car, the black SUV, the con.

46:45.410 --> 46:47.400
- Nilah, I'm was wrong.

46:47.400 --> 46:48.850
He's dangerous.

46:48.850 --> 46:52.130
- Miss Claire Adams, the great white hope

46:52.130 --> 46:54.600
of independent feminist cinema.

46:54.600 --> 46:57.343
She had to save your life,
just to get your attention.

46:58.190 --> 46:59.023
- No, wait.

46:59.023 --> 47:00.423
That's not true, Miss Adams.

47:02.260 --> 47:03.890
- [Narrator] Booyah.

47:03.890 --> 47:05.990
Everything happens for a reason.

47:05.990 --> 47:06.823
Don't you agree?

47:07.670 --> 47:11.673
Everybody has moments in
life, to take, to seize.

47:12.557 --> 47:14.617
"Grandiose yourself," my mama would say.

47:27.130 --> 47:29.050
- Ma'am, I'm sorry.

47:29.050 --> 47:29.883
- No worries.

47:36.196 --> 47:38.400
- When I watch your films,

47:38.400 --> 47:41.253
I know I'm not alone in the world.

47:42.360 --> 47:43.663
I believe these are yours.

47:44.750 --> 47:47.030
You are an inspiration not only to me

47:47.030 --> 47:49.130
but to all female filmmakers.

47:49.130 --> 47:49.963
- That means a lot to me.

47:49.963 --> 47:50.796
It was really nice to meet you.

47:50.796 --> 47:52.733
I'm sorry, I have an important meeting.

47:55.961 --> 47:56.794
- [Nilah] Miss Adams!

47:56.794 --> 47:58.280
(grunting)

47:58.280 --> 47:59.800
- [Mr. Emu] You could
have killed her, you know.

47:59.800 --> 48:01.340
- That's not true.

48:01.340 --> 48:02.173
Right?

48:02.173 --> 48:04.010
- She could't afford a mentor.

48:04.010 --> 48:07.930
She's a filmmaker adrift
and a terrible screenwriter.

48:07.930 --> 48:11.163
Nothing to leverage but ambition and grit.

48:12.897 --> 48:14.373
- You could have killed me.

48:15.780 --> 48:17.307
I should have left you!

48:19.240 --> 48:20.763
I could have died!

48:22.964 --> 48:23.797
You ...

48:24.640 --> 48:25.480
Bitch!

48:25.480 --> 48:26.470
- Bitch?

48:26.470 --> 48:27.427
Nobody calls me that.

48:27.427 --> 48:30.260
You're so stuck up, you'd
drown in a rainstorm.

48:30.260 --> 48:32.410
The sun don't come up to hear you crow.

48:32.410 --> 48:33.767
- Oh, more sayings (speaking
in foreign language).

48:34.753 --> 48:37.360
- I gave you purpose, I gave you life.

48:37.360 --> 48:38.193
- Bitch.

48:38.193 --> 48:40.302
You psychotic bitch.

48:40.302 --> 48:41.135
- What, what?

48:41.135 --> 48:41.968
I can't hear you.

48:41.968 --> 48:43.130
My ear is cut off!

48:43.130 --> 48:46.063
- Oh come on, a small portion
of the cartilage at best.

48:48.910 --> 48:50.800
- It's admirable.

48:50.800 --> 48:54.540
A mentor is everything in this industry.

48:54.540 --> 48:56.120
It was a necessity.

48:56.120 --> 48:58.020
- Damn straight.

48:58.020 --> 49:00.807
- It's like what Claire
taught you about Herzog:

49:00.807 --> 49:05.630
"If you need air to breath,
it is your absolute right."

49:05.630 --> 49:06.490
- Exactly.

49:06.490 --> 49:07.560
A true necessity.

49:07.560 --> 49:10.480
Something Miss Privileged
here can't understand.

49:10.480 --> 49:13.963
- I think the wrong filmmaker
got their ear cut off.

49:17.270 --> 49:18.103
Mr. Raven?

49:19.231 --> 49:21.314
(crying)

49:35.570 --> 49:36.740
Just shake it off.

49:36.740 --> 49:38.970
She's not half the producer you are.

49:38.970 --> 49:41.253
Lest we forget, this is your film too.

49:42.490 --> 49:43.570
- Color correction?

49:43.570 --> 49:45.460
- Fuck color correction.

49:45.460 --> 49:47.220
Remember, it's just me.

49:47.220 --> 49:50.010
It was your idea to have fake bosses.

49:50.010 --> 49:51.643
- Mystery bosses are good.

49:52.690 --> 49:53.523
- Are you okay?

49:54.480 --> 49:55.700
- I like fake bosses.

49:55.700 --> 49:56.730
- Ah, fuck yeah!

49:56.730 --> 49:59.350
It's like, I don't know
who's pulling the strings,

49:59.350 --> 50:01.266
but I fucking want to know.

50:01.266 --> 50:03.220
It's uh, it's so ...

50:03.220 --> 50:04.506
- Ominous?

50:04.506 --> 50:05.470
- Yeah.

50:05.470 --> 50:06.303
Get up.

50:15.770 --> 50:16.800
- I'm sorry.

50:16.800 --> 50:18.600
You can still get your credits back.

50:20.540 --> 50:21.860
- She's staring.

50:21.860 --> 50:22.870
She can't hear, right?

50:22.870 --> 50:23.820
- Of course not.

50:23.820 --> 50:25.920
Not like she can read lips.

50:25.920 --> 50:27.430
She doesn't have super powers.

50:27.430 --> 50:30.030
- Doesn't she do dialogue
transcribing for her movies?

50:30.030 --> 50:30.863
- No way.

50:32.240 --> 50:33.870
- I couldn't see her coming in the van.

50:33.870 --> 50:35.150
I can't see anything.

50:35.150 --> 50:37.060
I'm like John Ford with a white hood.

50:37.060 --> 50:38.160
I gotta lift it up.

50:38.160 --> 50:39.390
- Don't insult Ford.

50:39.390 --> 50:40.223
Okay?

50:40.223 --> 50:41.530
I can't see caca either.

50:41.530 --> 50:42.883
- She's freaking me out.

50:44.230 --> 50:45.653
He was poisoned.

50:48.160 --> 50:50.950
- You have you be a tyrant
to get what you want.

50:50.950 --> 50:53.900
Nothing matters but the final product.

50:53.900 --> 50:54.870
- Thanks.

50:54.870 --> 50:55.703
I mean it.

50:55.703 --> 50:57.230
I just needed to hear it.

50:57.230 --> 50:58.330
You're a great mentor.

51:00.040 --> 51:02.160
- I will give Mr. Emu this much, though.

51:02.160 --> 51:03.090
He was right.

51:03.090 --> 51:04.740
We should have incorporated this.

51:05.645 --> 51:09.562
(speaking in foreign language)

51:11.370 --> 51:12.930
- Find anything suspicious.

51:12.930 --> 51:15.220
Poisons, pills.

51:15.220 --> 51:16.170
Mrs. Hawk called.

51:16.170 --> 51:18.370
She said she thinks the
intern was poisoned.

51:19.637 --> 51:21.292
(speaking in foreign language)

51:24.300 --> 51:26.220
- Mr. Raven poisoned him?

51:26.220 --> 51:27.573
For full screen credits?

51:28.580 --> 51:30.340
- [Narrator] It's transformative.

51:30.340 --> 51:31.760
It's beauty.

51:31.760 --> 51:32.910
It's life.

51:32.910 --> 51:34.063
- Where's my sword?

51:35.330 --> 51:37.150
- [Narrator] How does
one straddle the fence

51:37.150 --> 51:39.923
of insanity and truth?

51:46.550 --> 51:48.300
- Where's the pretentious director?

51:51.670 --> 51:54.553
- Okay, Mr. Raven, who's the assassin?

52:00.140 --> 52:05.140
Our nitwit blabbed about
Mr. Pigeon cheating on her.

52:06.342 --> 52:07.425
Oh, so close.

52:08.882 --> 52:10.751
- You think Mr. Emu did it?

52:10.751 --> 52:12.970
(speaking in foreign language)

52:12.970 --> 52:13.970
- Set it up.

52:54.050 --> 52:56.600
- He did always want
to be a script reader.

52:56.600 --> 52:57.913
A script doctor.

52:59.270 --> 53:00.727
- He's too dumb to be
(speaking in foreign language).

53:04.200 --> 53:05.700
- Or to have planned a murder.

53:14.180 --> 53:15.153
- Motherfucker.

53:23.240 --> 53:24.073
Motherfucker.

53:28.760 --> 53:30.363
- I'm sorry about all this.

53:31.280 --> 53:33.110
I'm not sure about anything anymore.

53:33.110 --> 53:34.780
El Jefe is scaring me.

53:34.780 --> 53:35.720
- The Owl guy?

53:35.720 --> 53:36.750
- [Mr. Emu] Who else?

53:36.750 --> 53:38.470
I'm afraid to drink
anything but tap water.

53:38.470 --> 53:40.130
- His boss?

53:40.130 --> 53:41.620
- There's no boss.

53:41.620 --> 53:42.630
Nobody's on the phone.

53:42.630 --> 53:43.463
It's a gimmick.

53:45.200 --> 53:46.033
- What?

53:47.150 --> 53:49.240
- I think the Boss Man
killed the script reader.

53:49.240 --> 53:50.190
Poisoned him.

53:50.190 --> 53:51.663
He thinks he's gonna squeal.

53:53.170 --> 53:54.210
- Help us.

53:54.210 --> 53:55.710
Please.

53:55.710 --> 53:56.718
- Yeah.

53:56.718 --> 53:57.837
Mm-hm.

53:57.837 --> 53:58.670
Oh, okay.

54:00.230 --> 54:01.627
Pick up's at 8:15.

54:01.627 --> 54:04.283
And for fuck's sake, leave the sword.

54:08.580 --> 54:11.740
It's better I don't hold this
and do something foolish.

54:11.740 --> 54:12.633
Go find the tape.

54:16.470 --> 54:18.040
- Claire Adams.

54:18.040 --> 54:22.320
Please tell your student,
Nilah, about Yonnie.

54:22.320 --> 54:24.399
Let's not have a repeat.

54:24.399 --> 54:25.630
- What about?

54:25.630 --> 54:27.570
- About your award tonight.

54:27.570 --> 54:29.880
The Independent Courage Award.

54:29.880 --> 54:30.860
- Bravery.

54:30.860 --> 54:35.483
- Bravery, courage, courtesy,
boldness, who cares?

54:36.760 --> 54:41.352
Why is your award-winning film in German?

54:41.352 --> 54:42.628
(groaning)

54:42.628 --> 54:43.461
- Ouch.

54:43.461 --> 54:44.294
Shit.

54:44.294 --> 54:46.640
German reflects the aesthetic of my theme,

54:46.640 --> 54:49.373
the belonging of the
anti-hero's origin story.

54:50.240 --> 54:51.570
Notice the last scene,

54:51.570 --> 54:53.400
how the eyes move across the mise-en-scene

54:53.400 --> 54:55.363
as influenced by German Expressionism.

54:56.860 --> 54:57.943
- It's disgusting.

54:58.840 --> 55:01.940
In another life, I would
have hired you as a director.

55:01.940 --> 55:03.470
- [Mr. Emu] Better than
the last hombre you fired.

55:03.470 --> 55:04.360
- Stop.

55:04.360 --> 55:06.549
- It's true, he did nothing but complain.

55:06.549 --> 55:07.382
- [Mr. Owl] Enough.

55:07.382 --> 55:10.380
- Holy crap, Mr. Producer.

55:10.380 --> 55:13.870
You fucking fired your director
and lost all your funding.

55:13.870 --> 55:15.360
Brilliant.

55:15.360 --> 55:18.200
You're the antagonist of this mess.

55:18.200 --> 55:20.240
- He was messing up my film!

55:20.240 --> 55:21.670
He lost control of the actors!

55:21.670 --> 55:23.060
Everything was ...

55:23.060 --> 55:24.000
improvised!

55:24.000 --> 55:25.030
- He refused to do coverage.

55:25.030 --> 55:25.920
He wouldn't listen.

55:25.920 --> 55:27.800
- A producer has no vision.

55:27.800 --> 55:30.310
He can't invoke metaphor,
tap into the soul.

55:30.310 --> 55:31.890
A pencil pusher.

55:31.890 --> 55:34.080
He only likes the idea of making movies

55:34.080 --> 55:36.327
so he can bang all the
girls at the parties.

55:36.327 --> 55:39.693
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

55:49.128 --> 55:52.473
- [Mrs. Hawk] (sniffles)
He took away my talisman.

55:53.950 --> 55:55.200
- Well, leave.

55:55.200 --> 55:57.700
- I can't, I've invested
too much of my own money.

55:58.640 --> 55:59.563
What should I do?

56:01.830 --> 56:04.060
I think he's gonna hurt her.

56:04.060 --> 56:06.447
- Well, make sure he doesn't.

56:06.447 --> 56:07.780
- But he has vision.

56:07.780 --> 56:09.660
He's an artist at work.

56:09.660 --> 56:11.783
What do I know about such things?

56:13.070 --> 56:14.370
Should I go back in there?

56:17.130 --> 56:19.063
- Oh yes, yes.

56:20.630 --> 56:23.870
- Some people deserve to be treated badly.

56:23.870 --> 56:25.380
But not the producers.

56:25.380 --> 56:27.090
- Just let me go.

56:27.090 --> 56:28.670
You almost have your funding.

56:28.670 --> 56:30.970
I'll get the rest for you, somehow.

56:30.970 --> 56:32.720
I have connections for post.

56:32.720 --> 56:35.330
- You couldn't raise $500 on Kickstarter.

56:35.330 --> 56:37.010
- [Mr. Emu] Easy, boss.

56:37.010 --> 56:40.500
- The reason your film is in German

56:40.500 --> 56:44.620
is because Yonnie
conceptualized it in German.

56:44.620 --> 56:46.940
- [Nilah] Who is this Yonnie guy?

56:46.940 --> 56:49.270
- Yonnie is the screenwriter.

56:49.270 --> 56:51.570
The true genius behind the film.

56:51.570 --> 56:53.640
He deserves the award.

56:53.640 --> 56:55.350
- He wrote it?

56:55.350 --> 56:56.220
- Of course he wrote it.

56:56.220 --> 56:57.800
- Originally, yes.

56:57.800 --> 57:00.290
But I tweaked it so much it became mine.

57:00.290 --> 57:02.220
- Did you give him a story by credit?

57:02.220 --> 57:03.880
- No.

57:03.880 --> 57:05.683
I didn't give him any credit.

57:07.020 --> 57:08.270
- He wrote the movie.

57:08.270 --> 57:10.310
He's the screenwriter.

57:10.310 --> 57:11.143
You're not brave.

57:11.143 --> 57:12.080
You're a coward.

57:12.080 --> 57:13.370
And immoral.

57:13.370 --> 57:15.370
- Sometimes you commit indecent acts

57:15.370 --> 57:17.333
to bring beauty into the world.

57:18.190 --> 57:21.973
I assure you there is nothing
of Yonnie in my final film.

57:23.070 --> 57:25.470
The only mistake I made was not giving him

57:25.470 --> 57:27.210
a shared story by credit.

57:27.210 --> 57:28.163
That's it.

57:30.730 --> 57:31.760
- You tricked Yonnie.

57:31.760 --> 57:34.990
He wrote the blueprint for your film.

57:34.990 --> 57:36.920
- You can't judge me.

57:36.920 --> 57:38.430
You bamboozled me.

57:38.430 --> 57:40.040
You tried to kill me.

57:40.040 --> 57:42.190
- Hey, who poisoned the Pigeon man?

57:42.190 --> 57:43.460
- I knew it.

57:43.460 --> 57:45.430
You tried to kill our script reader.

57:45.430 --> 57:46.580
- What do you care?

57:46.580 --> 57:47.936
He was an intern.

57:47.936 --> 57:49.870
- He was going to be a producer.

57:49.870 --> 57:51.580
Some day.

57:51.580 --> 57:54.260
- Here is your final film lesson.

57:54.260 --> 57:57.020
A movie isn't a screenplay.

57:57.020 --> 57:58.360
Your script isn't the blueprint,

57:58.360 --> 58:00.860
it isn't a map or even a guide.

58:00.860 --> 58:03.820
Kazan says you're not building a house,

58:03.820 --> 58:06.180
you're building a part of your life.

58:06.180 --> 58:08.184
- Yeah well, this Kazan fellow is wrong.

58:08.184 --> 58:09.351
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

58:10.810 --> 58:11.643
- At best.

58:11.643 --> 58:14.760
At best, a script inspires.

58:14.760 --> 58:17.610
Even Ford said, "There's no
such thing as a good script."

58:18.626 --> 58:20.800
I mean sure, pay for it.

58:20.800 --> 58:24.840
But a laundry list of what
stimulated you in the credits?

58:24.840 --> 58:26.870
And this is the only piece of work

58:26.870 --> 58:28.340
Yonnie wrote that turned out good.

58:28.340 --> 58:29.173
- Stop.

58:29.173 --> 58:30.910
- His script was and is trash.

58:30.910 --> 58:31.743
- Enough.

58:31.743 --> 58:32.700
- He offers very little to the world.

58:32.700 --> 58:34.280
He's a hack!

58:34.280 --> 58:35.113
- Shing.

58:36.104 --> 58:38.271
(gun fires from another room)

58:43.118 --> 58:47.099
No, no, no. (crying)

58:47.099 --> 58:50.182
I should have never brought you here.

58:54.208 --> 58:55.440
- Yonnie?

58:55.440 --> 58:57.080
That isn't Yonnie, right, Nilah?

58:57.080 --> 58:58.962
- [Narrator] How would I know, Claire?

58:58.962 --> 59:00.262
How the fuck would I know?

59:10.750 --> 59:12.640
I did it.

59:12.640 --> 59:13.900
- What?

59:13.900 --> 59:15.470
- I poisoned the Pigeon man.

59:15.470 --> 59:16.790
I was going to poison all of them

59:16.790 --> 59:19.844
so we could escape, but
Mr. Owl offered me a job.

59:19.844 --> 59:20.710
- What?

59:20.710 --> 59:21.820
- Look, you understand.

59:21.820 --> 59:24.037
Sometimes you have to commit immoral acts.

59:24.037 --> 59:25.633
I'm sorry I tried to blame you.

59:27.027 --> 59:27.877
Damn, I'm poison.

59:29.530 --> 59:30.363
- Why did you even ...

59:30.363 --> 59:32.160
- I hate script readers.

59:32.160 --> 59:33.660
Don't you?

59:33.660 --> 59:34.873
- Carry poison?

59:38.688 --> 59:41.521
(energetic music)

59:53.635 --> 59:55.050
- Wrong way!

59:55.050 --> 59:55.883
Wrong way!

59:55.883 --> 59:57.133
- You fat fuck!

1:00:02.396 --> 1:00:03.380
(gun clicks)
- Ha.

1:00:03.380 --> 1:00:04.883
Misfire, total cliche.

1:00:13.580 --> 1:00:16.493
- If you don't stop, I'll
cut your fucking head off.

1:00:17.480 --> 1:00:19.830
You flightless shit for brains.

1:00:19.830 --> 1:00:21.920
You thought I wouldn't
notice you cozying up

1:00:21.920 --> 1:00:23.233
to Miss Courageous?

1:00:24.150 --> 1:00:25.203
- Miss Bravery.

1:00:26.150 --> 1:00:30.263
- If you two come back, I
won't do anything ill-advised.

1:00:31.220 --> 1:00:32.180
Listen.

1:00:32.180 --> 1:00:33.650
No one's been hurt yet.

1:00:33.650 --> 1:00:35.510
- Look, he kidnapped you, handcuffed you.

1:00:35.510 --> 1:00:36.793
You owe him nothing.

1:00:39.120 --> 1:00:42.143
- If you leave, I'll cut his head off.

1:00:43.033 --> 1:00:44.070
(speaking in foreign language)

1:00:44.070 --> 1:00:45.880
- It's okay.

1:00:45.880 --> 1:00:46.773
I deserve it.

1:00:50.962 --> 1:00:53.629
(keys jangling)

1:00:55.820 --> 1:00:58.070
(groaning)

1:01:09.895 --> 1:01:11.978
(vomits)

1:01:24.977 --> 1:01:26.064
- What?

1:01:26.064 --> 1:01:26.897
No, no, no.

1:01:26.897 --> 1:01:27.730
Stop, stop!

1:01:36.744 --> 1:01:39.994
(ethereal vocal music)

1:01:44.790 --> 1:01:47.310
- This mentorship is a lie.

1:01:47.310 --> 1:01:48.630
- Hand that to me.

1:01:48.630 --> 1:01:49.850
- Admit it.

1:01:49.850 --> 1:01:51.140
- Let's get out of here.

1:01:51.140 --> 1:01:51.973
- Admit it.

1:01:51.973 --> 1:01:52.806
- Admit what?

1:01:52.806 --> 1:01:54.580
- You would have left me there.

1:01:54.580 --> 1:01:55.540
- What?

1:01:55.540 --> 1:01:58.250
- That were me under the sword,
you would have deserted me.

1:01:58.250 --> 1:02:01.390
You only think about yourself.

1:02:01.390 --> 1:02:03.552
- Come on, let's get out of here.

1:02:03.552 --> 1:02:05.002
- You can't walk all over me.

1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:08.253
I have a breaking point.

1:02:16.340 --> 1:02:17.507
I don't need you.

1:02:17.507 --> 1:02:18.957
I don't need those producers.

1:02:22.043 --> 1:02:24.460
(gun clicks)

1:02:29.180 --> 1:02:30.013
- Wait.

1:02:30.867 --> 1:02:33.317
- "My love of film is
far more important to me

1:02:33.317 --> 1:02:35.930
"than considerations of immorality."

1:02:35.930 --> 1:02:38.379
- A Hitchcock quote won't absolve you.

1:02:38.379 --> 1:02:39.350
(gun fires)

1:02:39.350 --> 1:02:41.610
- You think all we care
about is your mom's money?

1:02:41.610 --> 1:02:43.330
- You have lost the plot.

1:02:43.330 --> 1:02:45.630
- This is a snuff film.

1:02:45.630 --> 1:02:48.810
Guaranteed distribution
and a goddam presale.

1:02:48.810 --> 1:02:51.180
Like Wu Tang Clan selling an entire album

1:02:51.180 --> 1:02:52.680
to one rich fuck.

1:02:52.680 --> 1:02:53.930
This is one in the same.

1:02:53.930 --> 1:02:55.553
One movie, one person.

1:02:56.672 --> 1:02:59.755
(chuckles anxiously)

1:03:01.157 --> 1:03:03.080
- Oh, you think this is a joke?

1:03:03.080 --> 1:03:04.100
- It has to be.

1:03:04.100 --> 1:03:06.090
Some sick joke!

1:03:06.090 --> 1:03:07.217
- Haven't you heard?

1:03:07.217 --> 1:03:11.060
"All you need for a movie
is a gun and a girl."

1:03:11.060 --> 1:03:13.123
- All this just to make a movie?

1:03:13.123 --> 1:03:14.330
- We're Dadaists.

1:03:14.330 --> 1:03:16.640
We don't need the rules of society.

1:03:16.640 --> 1:03:19.890
Fuck the bourgeois and
privileged artists like you.

1:03:19.890 --> 1:03:21.503
- We are Herzogians!

1:03:22.450 --> 1:03:25.380
- Yes, yes we're all Herzogians!

1:03:27.279 --> 1:03:30.737
- Herzogians are anti-Herzogians.

1:03:30.737 --> 1:03:33.487
"Always destroy what is in you."

1:03:34.984 --> 1:03:37.317
(gun fires)

1:03:41.780 --> 1:03:42.861
- Wait.

1:03:42.861 --> 1:03:43.694
Cut.

1:03:43.694 --> 1:03:46.710
You can't stray from the
script when it comes to guns.

1:03:46.710 --> 1:03:47.543
Hand that over.

1:03:49.900 --> 1:03:50.733
Now.

1:03:50.733 --> 1:03:52.773
- You can't cut, you're not the director.

1:03:53.800 --> 1:03:55.450
Dada is anti-Dada.

1:03:55.450 --> 1:03:57.153
- Nilah, now.

1:03:58.392 --> 1:04:00.489
(gun fires)

1:04:00.489 --> 1:04:01.920
- [Cinematographer] Oh
fuck, he's really dead.

1:04:01.920 --> 1:04:03.700
- Where did you get that?

1:04:03.700 --> 1:04:04.533
She has live rounds!

1:04:04.533 --> 1:04:07.480
- Keep rolling, keep
rolling, keep rolling!

1:04:07.480 --> 1:04:10.390
Everybody keep fucking
rolling or I shoot the Gaffer

1:04:10.390 --> 1:04:12.283
and every motherfucking P.A. in here!

1:04:14.270 --> 1:04:16.030
Get on your knees.

1:04:16.030 --> 1:04:18.533
Get on your knees!

1:04:20.280 --> 1:04:22.270
You can't subjugate people
and get away with it

1:04:22.270 --> 1:04:24.210
just because you're an artist.

1:04:24.210 --> 1:04:25.853
You exploited Yonnie.

1:04:26.768 --> 1:04:27.720
(spits)

1:04:27.720 --> 1:04:29.574
- I spit on John Ford.

1:04:29.574 --> 1:04:31.190
(spits)

1:04:31.190 --> 1:04:34.370
- And after you hit the
ground, I'll spit on you.

1:04:34.370 --> 1:04:35.930
- Wait, wait.

1:04:35.930 --> 1:04:37.230
- Always end with a death.

1:04:38.250 --> 1:04:39.403
- Look, I am not Ford.

1:04:40.520 --> 1:04:41.493
- Then who are you?

1:04:42.830 --> 1:04:43.703
- Don't kill me.

1:04:45.920 --> 1:04:47.490
You don't have a character arc.

1:04:47.490 --> 1:04:48.323
I'll change.

1:04:48.323 --> 1:04:50.557
I will, I'll change,
I'll change right now.

1:04:50.557 --> 1:04:52.910
I'll reflect, and think and--

1:04:52.910 --> 1:04:54.620
- Character arcs are for cowards

1:04:54.620 --> 1:04:57.383
and those of weak constitution.

1:04:57.383 --> 1:05:00.543
- Look, I am your mentor, I'm your mentor!

1:05:01.510 --> 1:05:03.413
- Mentoring is anti-mentoring.

1:05:09.906 --> 1:05:10.739
(gun fires)

1:05:10.739 --> 1:05:11.614

1:09:41.803 --> 1:09:42.770
Because we're three days behind schedule

1:09:42.770 --> 1:09:44.200
