22:51.625 --> 22:53.000
- I DON'T GET THESE CRAZY--

22:53.000 --> 22:54.166
- YOU DO, AND THEN
YOU END UP DIVORCED...

22:54.166 --> 22:56.500
- SHH.
- WITH A BROKEN DOWN TRANS AM,

22:56.500 --> 23:02.542
AND BARELY ENOUGH MONEY
TO PAY THE RENT.

23:02.542 --> 23:05.375
[door buzzes, opens]

23:11.083 --> 23:12.750
- I SEE YOU BROUGHT JURG.

23:12.750 --> 23:15.542
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU BOTH GETTING
ON IN MY ABSENCE.

23:15.542 --> 23:17.667
- WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING?
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN ARRESTED,

23:17.667 --> 23:20.417
I CAN'T TAKE A SHIT WITHOUT
LURCH BREATHING DOWN MY NECK.

23:20.417 --> 23:26.333
- WELL SOMEONE HAS TO KEEP
AN EYE ON YOU WHILE I'M IN HERE.

23:26.333 --> 23:28.333
- SO WHAT'S THE BIG EMERGENCY?

23:28.333 --> 23:30.208
- YOU NEED TO GET
ME OUT OF HERE,

23:30.208 --> 23:31.750
AS SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE.

23:31.750 --> 23:33.333
- WHAT HAPPENED?

23:33.333 --> 23:34.625
- NOTHING.

23:34.625 --> 23:36.583
YET.

23:36.583 --> 23:41.125
BUT I'D REALLY LIKE
TO AVOID KILLING ANYONE IN HERE.

23:41.125 --> 23:46.083
IT WOULD GET IN THE WAY
OF MY BEING RELEASED.

23:46.083 --> 23:50.375
HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM DETECTIVE QUINN?

23:50.375 --> 23:55.125
- HE, UM...
HE GAVE BACK THE MONEY.

23:55.125 --> 23:56.625
WHICH IS WEIRD, BECAUSE

23:56.625 --> 24:00.208
E'S NEVER TURNED DOWN
A PAYOFF BEFORE.

24:00.208 --> 24:02.875
- [breathes deeply]

24:02.875 --> 24:06.125
GEORGE...

24:06.125 --> 24:09.375
DO NOT DISAPPOINT ME.

24:26.083 --> 24:30.166
[crowd chattering]

24:30.166 --> 24:31.458
- HI.

24:31.458 --> 24:33.625
QUINN.
RESERVATION FOR TWO.

24:33.625 --> 24:35.125
- YOUR OTHER PARTY
HAS ALREADY ARRIVED.

24:35.125 --> 24:37.333
RIGHT THIS WAY, MR. QUINN.

24:37.333 --> 24:41.750
[overlapping chatter]

24:47.083 --> 24:52.250
ENJOY YOUR DINNER.

24:52.250 --> 24:53.875
- WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?

24:53.875 --> 24:57.458
WHERE'S NADIA?

24:57.458 --> 25:00.417
IF YOU HURT HER,
I WILL PUT A BULLET

25:00.417 --> 25:02.250
THROUGH YOUR
MOTHERFUCKING HEAD.

25:02.250 --> 25:06.166
- EASY, DETECTIVE.
DON'T MAKE A SCENE.

25:06.166 --> 25:08.667
NADIA IS A VALUABLE COMMODITY.

25:08.667 --> 25:13.709
WE WOULDN'T DO THAT.
NOT UNLESS WE HAD TO.

25:22.291 --> 25:23.792
- WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

25:23.792 --> 25:25.375
- I DON'T WANT SHIT.

25:25.375 --> 25:26.959
BUT ISAAK SIRKO,

25:26.959 --> 25:28.417
HE WANTS YOU
TO LOSE THE BLOOD EVIDENCE

25:28.417 --> 25:29.667
LINKING HIM
TO THE COLOMBIAN MURDERS.

25:29.667 --> 25:32.000
- WHY THE FUCK WOULD
I DO THAT FOR YOU?

25:32.000 --> 25:33.333
- WELL, YOU TOOK
OUR MONEY FOR STARTERS.

25:33.333 --> 25:34.834
- AND I GAVE IT BACK.

25:34.834 --> 25:36.166
I DON'T OWE YOU SHIT.

25:36.166 --> 25:38.417
- NOT THE WAY ISAAK SEES IT.

25:38.417 --> 25:40.083
NOW, HE DID YOU
A FAVOR BY TAKING OUT

25:40.083 --> 25:41.875
THOSE COLOMBIAN SCUMBAGS.

25:41.875 --> 25:43.166
AS SOON AS YOU LET HIM GO,

25:43.166 --> 25:44.542
HE'LL HEAD BACK
TO THE UKRAINE.

25:44.542 --> 25:46.250
YOU'LL NEVER HEAR
FROM HIM AGAIN.

25:46.250 --> 25:47.542
IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.

25:47.542 --> 25:49.083
- THEN FIND SOMEONE ELSE.

25:49.083 --> 25:52.709
- NOW WHY WOULD WE DO THAT
WHEN WE HAVE YOU?

25:55.041 --> 25:56.250
JOEY, COME ON.

25:56.250 --> 25:59.375
YOU KNOW WE GOT YOU.

26:01.709 --> 26:05.709
- WHAT HAPPENS
IF I DON'T COOPERATE?

26:05.709 --> 26:07.417
- I'M THINKING
OF TRANSFERRING NADIA

26:07.417 --> 26:10.417
TO ONE
OF OUR SEX CLUBS IN DUBAI.

26:10.417 --> 26:12.667
BUT SHE'S A STRONG GIRL.

26:12.667 --> 26:18.333
SHE'LL LAST A COUPLE WEEKS
BEFORE SHE SLITS HER WRISTS.

26:18.333 --> 26:21.709
- IF I DO THIS...

26:21.709 --> 26:24.583
NADIA'S A FREE WOMAN.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.166
YOU GIVE ME HER FUCKING
PASSPORT, UNDERSTAND?

26:27.166 --> 26:29.917
- DEAL.

26:29.917 --> 26:31.208
AND I'LL DO YOU ONE BETTER.

26:31.208 --> 26:35.083
YOU CAN EVEN KEEP THE CASH.

26:38.375 --> 26:39.917
SEE, JOE?

26:39.917 --> 26:44.375
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.

26:56.333 --> 26:59.667
[phone dialing]

26:59.667 --> 27:01.917
- IT'S NADIA.
LEAVE A MESSAGE. [beep]

27:01.917 --> 27:07.000
- NADIA, IT'S JOEY.
CALL ME AS SOON AS YOU GET THIS.

27:11.458 --> 27:16.792
- YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?
- YEAH.

27:16.792 --> 27:18.208
- HOW WAS THE MEETING
WITH THE D.A.?

27:18.208 --> 27:19.709
- UH, FINE.

27:19.709 --> 27:21.333
HE'S CONFIDENT THAT
WE HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE

27:21.333 --> 27:22.917
TO PUT SIRKO AWAY
FOR A LONG TIME.

27:22.917 --> 27:24.166
- [sighs]

27:24.166 --> 27:27.000
THANK THE SWEET FUCKING
BABY JESUS.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.667
- BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

27:31.667 --> 27:34.834
I HAD MY LAST
TWO INTERVIEWS YESTERDAY.

27:34.834 --> 27:36.458
YOU KNOW, WITH THE FAMILIES
OF THE MISSING PERSONS

27:36.458 --> 27:37.625
WHO I THOUGHT COULD
HAVE BEEN VICTIMS

27:37.625 --> 27:39.959
OF THE BAY HARBOR BUTCHER?

27:39.959 --> 27:41.041
- AND? ANY LEADS?

27:41.041 --> 27:42.834
- NOT A ONE.

27:42.834 --> 27:46.041
- IT'S FRUSTRATING.

27:46.041 --> 27:48.375
- SO I STARTED LOOKING
INTO OPEN CASES.

27:48.375 --> 27:53.792
I FIGURE, A LOT OF HOMICIDE
SUSPECTS VANISH INTO THIN AIR.

27:53.792 --> 27:57.667
WHAT IF THE BUTCHER
TOOK SOME OF THEM OUT?

27:57.667 --> 28:00.125
- THAT'S GOOD THINKING.

28:00.125 --> 28:01.166
DID YOU FIND ANYTHING?

28:01.166 --> 28:04.041
- MAYBE.

28:04.041 --> 28:06.834
REMEMBER THE BARREL GIRLS?
- A SWAMP FULL

28:06.834 --> 28:09.709
OF BLONDES IN BARRELS,
ALL OF THEM...

28:09.709 --> 28:11.500
RAPED, ELECTROCUTED,
AND EMBALMED?

28:11.500 --> 28:13.792
YEAH, HOW COULD I FORGET IT?

28:13.792 --> 28:16.583
- ALL FIVE SUSPECTS,
INCLUDING SELF-HELP GURU

28:16.583 --> 28:18.959
JORDAN CHASE,
WENT MISSING

28:18.959 --> 28:21.000
BEFORE WE COULD BUILD
A CASE AGAINST THEM.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.458
- YOU'RE THINKING THE BUTCHER
COULD HAVE KILLED THEM.

28:24.458 --> 28:26.500
THERE WERE
TWO VIGILANTE KILLERS.

28:26.500 --> 28:28.875
- MAYBE HE TOOK
ON AN ACCOMPLICE.

28:28.875 --> 28:32.208
ONE OF THE VICTIMS
WHO WAS LOOKING FOR JUSTICE?

28:32.208 --> 28:34.375
I'M--[sighs]

28:34.375 --> 28:38.458
I KNOW IT'S A REACH.

28:38.458 --> 28:42.125
BUT IT'S POSSIBLE.

28:42.125 --> 28:45.542
- WASN'T THE THEORY THAT JORDAN
CHASE KILLED THE ACCOMPLICES,

28:45.542 --> 28:47.667
THEN FLED THE COUNTRY?
- YES, BUT EVEN

28:47.667 --> 28:51.333
IF CHASE KILLED
THE OTHER FOUR SUSPECTS,

28:51.333 --> 28:55.166
THE BUTCHER STILL COULD
HAVE KILLED CHASE.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.500
- I DON'T THINK SO.

29:03.500 --> 29:05.000
- [sighs]

29:05.000 --> 29:07.417
- JORDAN CHASE
WAS VERY HIGH PROFILE.

29:07.417 --> 29:11.041
IT WOULD BE TOO RISKY.

29:11.041 --> 29:14.208
- STILL...

29:14.208 --> 29:17.083
IT'S WORTH LOOKING INTO.

29:20.041 --> 29:24.792
[waves lapping]

29:24.792 --> 29:27.208
[keyboard clicking]

29:33.834 --> 29:35.375
- FIND WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?

29:35.375 --> 29:36.834
- IT SAYS HERE PRICE

29:36.834 --> 29:39.709
BRIBED THE FUNERAL DIRECTOR
TO GET ACCESS

29:39.709 --> 29:42.208
TO BEVERLY GREY'S BODY BEFORE
SHE WAS CREMATED.

29:42.208 --> 29:44.083
HE STOLE A BLOOD SAMPLE,

29:44.083 --> 29:47.417
AND RAN IT FOR ACONITE.
[keyboard clicking]

29:47.417 --> 29:49.000
- ACONITE?

29:49.000 --> 29:53.417
- THE QUEEN OF ALL POISONS.

29:53.417 --> 29:55.625
INGESTING IT CAUSES
A HEART ATTACK.

29:55.625 --> 29:57.875
[click, click]
PRICE SAYS IT'S BEEN GROWING ON

29:57.875 --> 30:00.166
THE GREENHOUSE PROPERTY
FOR YEARS.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.250
- POISON.

30:01.250 --> 30:03.291
YOU WERE RIGHT.

30:03.291 --> 30:04.417
IT DIDN'T SHOW
UP ON THE AUTOPSY?

30:04.417 --> 30:06.083
- IT WOULDN'T HAVE.

30:06.083 --> 30:08.083
NOT IF THEY DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR.

30:08.083 --> 30:12.709
HER BLOOD TEST.

30:12.709 --> 30:14.625
POSITIVE FOR ACONITE.

30:14.625 --> 30:16.458
PROOF THAT BEVERLY
WAS POISONED.

30:16.458 --> 30:19.750
- BUT NOT PROOF THAT HANNAH
DID THE POISONING.

30:19.750 --> 30:21.792
- HANNAH SAID
HER HANDYMAN WAS THERE

30:21.792 --> 30:23.291
WHEN BEVERLY WAS STILL ALIVE.

30:23.291 --> 30:25.375
THAT COULD BE WORTH
A CONVERSATION.

30:25.375 --> 30:29.583
[knock at door]

30:29.583 --> 30:34.291
JESUS, NOW SHE'S SHOWING
UP WHERE I LIVE.

30:47.500 --> 30:48.542
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

30:48.542 --> 30:51.000
- YOU PICKED THE WRONG PLANT.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.291
I KNEW I COULD DO BETTER.

30:52.291 --> 30:53.417
HOPEFULLY YOU WON'T KILL IT.

30:53.417 --> 30:54.667
- WHAT IS IT?

30:54.667 --> 30:57.792
- IT'S A SPOTTED PHALAENOPSIS.

30:57.792 --> 31:00.333
SEE THE RED ON THE PETALS?
REMIND YOU OF ANYTHING?

31:00.333 --> 31:01.500
- BLOOD SPATTER.

31:01.500 --> 31:03.875
- WHICH REMINDED ME OF YOU.

31:03.875 --> 31:07.709
- YOU CAME ALL THE WAY OUT HERE
JUST TO BRING ME THAT?

31:07.709 --> 31:10.667
HOW'D YOU FIND ME?
- GOOGLE.

31:10.667 --> 31:12.291
- NOW WHO'S A STALKER?

31:16.542 --> 31:18.709
I SHOULD ASK HER TO LEAVE.

31:18.709 --> 31:20.458
SO YOU WANT TO COME IN?

31:20.458 --> 31:22.041
- YEAH, SURE.

31:22.041 --> 31:25.291
I'LL HELP YOU FIND
A PLACE FOR IT.

31:25.291 --> 31:27.792
I NEED A SPOT NEAR A WINDOW,

31:27.792 --> 31:32.417
BUT NOT DIRECTLY
IN FRONT OF IT.

31:34.375 --> 31:37.375
- UH, NO,
THAT'S THE BEDROOM.

31:37.375 --> 31:40.000
NO PLANTS IN HERE.
NOT ENOUGH LIGHT.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.542
- YOU COULD OPEN THE SHADES.

31:43.542 --> 31:45.208
- I LIKE THE DARK.

31:45.208 --> 31:46.709
- SO DO I.

31:46.709 --> 31:48.208
- WHY IS SHE HERE?

31:48.208 --> 31:53.834
WHAT DOES SHE WANT?

31:58.041 --> 31:59.917
- THERE.

31:59.917 --> 32:02.083
NOW YOU CAN LOOK
AT IT WHEN YOU WAKE UP.

32:02.083 --> 32:05.625
AND WHEN YOU GO TO BED.

32:05.625 --> 32:08.625
[phone rings]

32:08.625 --> 32:11.792
- SORR--I GOTTA TAKE THIS.

32:11.792 --> 32:14.875
[beep]
HEY, DEB. WHAT'S UP?

32:14.875 --> 32:16.375
- UH, NOTHING, JUST THAT

32:16.375 --> 32:17.750
LAGUERTA MIGHT
HAVE ANOTHER THEORY

32:17.750 --> 32:19.250
THAT COULD ROYALLY FUCK US.

32:19.250 --> 32:20.917
CAN YOU MEET ME
AT MY HOUSE?

32:20.917 --> 32:22.250
- I'M KIND OF
IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.

32:22.250 --> 32:24.834
- DEX, THIS CAN'T WAIT.

32:24.834 --> 32:27.125
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL MEET YOU IN 20.

32:27.125 --> 32:29.375
[beep]

32:29.375 --> 32:35.208
[beep]

32:35.208 --> 32:36.792
- I'M TELLING YOU, DEXTER,

32:36.792 --> 32:38.291
LAGUERTA'S NOT JUST
GONNA FORGET THIS ONE.

32:38.291 --> 32:41.041
- JORDAN CHASE IS LONG GONE.
SO ARE THE OTHERS.

32:41.041 --> 32:44.583
THERE'S NOTHING
TO TRACE THEM BACK TO ME.

32:44.583 --> 32:48.375
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

32:48.375 --> 32:51.083
THERE ARE NO LOOSE ENDS?

32:51.083 --> 32:54.125
WHAT ABOUT THE PERSON
YOU WERE WORKING WITH?

32:54.125 --> 32:55.792
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

32:55.792 --> 32:57.458
- YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

32:57.458 --> 33:01.583
THERE WERE TWO VIGILANTE
KILLERS, NOT ONE.

33:01.583 --> 33:06.041
WHO WAS HELPING YOU?

33:06.041 --> 33:08.125
- SHE WASN'T HELPING ME.
I WAS HELPING HER.

33:08.125 --> 33:10.458
- WAS SHE ONE
OF THEIR VICTIMS?

33:10.458 --> 33:13.250
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

33:13.250 --> 33:14.583
IF LAGUERTA TRACKS HER DOWN,

33:14.583 --> 33:15.917
WHICH IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE,

33:15.917 --> 33:18.125
SHE WON'T INCRIMINATE HERSELF,
OR ME.

33:18.125 --> 33:21.834
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
- TRUST ME, I JUST DO.

33:24.333 --> 33:27.166
- MOTHERFUCKER.

33:29.667 --> 33:34.041
YOU WERE TOGETHER.

33:34.041 --> 33:38.750
LIKE A COUPLE.

33:38.750 --> 33:41.000
I REMEMBER HAVING
A THOUGHT THAT...

33:41.000 --> 33:45.834
WHOEVER WAS DOING THIS
WAS DOING IT FOR LOVE.

33:45.834 --> 33:49.542
THAT WAS
RIGHT AFTER RITA DIED.

33:49.542 --> 33:53.834
YOU HAD THAT TENANT WITH
THAT WEIRD FUCKING NAME.

33:53.834 --> 33:58.125
LUMEN.

33:58.125 --> 34:00.166
IT WAS HER, WASN'T IT?
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

34:00.166 --> 34:01.834
- IT WAS.

34:01.834 --> 34:04.333
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST, DEXTER.

34:04.333 --> 34:08.041
YOU MOVED YOUR GIRLFRIEND
INTO THE HOUSE

34:08.041 --> 34:12.709
WHERE TRINITY MURDERED
YOUR WIFE...

34:12.709 --> 34:14.000
SO YOU COULD KILL TOGETHER?

34:14.000 --> 34:16.041
- IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

34:16.041 --> 34:17.500
- [moans]

34:17.500 --> 34:19.667
- I FELT GUILTY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO RITA.

34:19.667 --> 34:21.709
- YOU FEL--
- I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE

34:21.709 --> 34:27.875
IF I HELPED LUMEN...

34:27.875 --> 34:29.417
I WAS TRYING
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

34:29.417 --> 34:30.917
- OF COURSE.

34:30.917 --> 34:34.083
BY MURDERING
FIVE OTHER PEOPLE.

34:34.083 --> 34:39.333
- [breathes deeply]

34:39.333 --> 34:40.834
WHY CAN'T THE PAST
JUST STAY IN THE PAST?

34:40.834 --> 34:42.583
DO WE HAVE TO KEEP TALKING
ABOUT THIS?

34:42.583 --> 34:45.875
- YEAH, WE DO, AS LONG AS
LAGUERTA HAS A BUG UP HER ASS.

34:45.875 --> 34:49.083
- LET ME WORRY ABOUT LAGUERTA,
PLEASE!

34:49.083 --> 34:50.792
YOU JUST--

34:50.792 --> 34:55.542
WORRY ABOUT YOURSELF.

34:55.542 --> 34:56.583
GO OUT.

34:56.583 --> 34:58.834
HAVE FUN.

34:58.834 --> 35:01.083
GO ON A DATE.

35:01.083 --> 35:04.917
THAT GUY, SAL PRICE.
HE WAS INTO YOU.

35:04.917 --> 35:06.917
- GET OUT OF MY HOUSE.

35:06.917 --> 35:10.875
- WHAT DID I SAY?

35:13.959 --> 35:17.709
[sighs]

35:21.083 --> 35:23.041
I REALLY NEED
TO KILL SOMEONE.

35:28.834 --> 35:30.667
HANNAH'S BECOME
A REAL THORN IN MY SIDE.

35:30.667 --> 35:33.458
[tape measure flexing]

35:33.458 --> 35:35.792
MAYBE HER HANDYMAN CAN GIVE
ME WHAT I NEED

35:35.792 --> 35:38.625
TO FINALLY FIX MY PROBLEM.

35:38.625 --> 35:40.750
EXCUSE ME.

35:40.750 --> 35:42.583
IS HANNAH HERE?

35:42.583 --> 35:44.041
- SHE'S AT THE FLOWER MARKET.

35:44.041 --> 35:46.458
- OH, MAN.
I DROVE ALL THE WAY OUT HERE.

35:46.458 --> 35:47.709
DO YOU KNOW WHEN SHE'LL BE BACK?

35:47.709 --> 35:51.542
- AN HOUR OR SO.
IT MIGHT BE SOONER.

35:51.542 --> 35:52.917
YOU COULD WAIT.

35:52.917 --> 35:55.583
[tape measure flexing]

36:05.458 --> 36:10.125
- HOW LONG HAVE
YOU BEEN WORKING HERE?

36:10.125 --> 36:11.375
- ABOUT TEN YEARS.

36:11.375 --> 36:13.709
- SO YOU KNEW
THE PREVIOUS OWNER.

36:13.709 --> 36:15.959
- BEVERLY GREY?

36:15.959 --> 36:17.208
- HANNAH SAID SHE PASSED AWAY.

36:17.208 --> 36:19.709
- HEART DISEASE.
SAD STORY.

36:19.709 --> 36:21.208
- YEAH, HANNAH SAID
THEY WERE CLOSE.

36:21.208 --> 36:24.709
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
HARD ON HER.

36:24.709 --> 36:26.375
- I'M SURE IT WAS, BUT...

36:26.375 --> 36:27.917
SHE NEVER LET IT SHOW.

36:27.917 --> 36:29.291
- NOT THE EMOTIONAL TYPE, HUH?

36:29.291 --> 36:30.834
- I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT.

36:30.834 --> 36:33.834
EVEN WHEN BEVERLY GOT SICK,
HANNAH NEVER COMPLAINED.

36:33.834 --> 36:36.834
NEVER ASKED FOR HELP.

36:36.834 --> 36:38.375
- HELP WITH WHAT?

36:38.375 --> 36:40.625
- TAKING CARE OF BEVERLY.

36:40.625 --> 36:42.166
HANNAH BATHED HER, FED HER,

36:42.166 --> 36:43.667
TOOK HER TO THE DOCTOR'S.

36:43.667 --> 36:45.500
- ALL ALONE?

36:45.500 --> 36:46.875
- SHE WAS STUBBORN, MAN.

36:46.875 --> 36:48.333
- [chortles]
- I FIGURED IT HAD

36:48.333 --> 36:50.000
SOMETHING TO DO WITH GROWING
UP ON A FARM, YOU KNOW?

36:50.000 --> 36:52.625
JUST...PLOWING THROUGH.

36:52.625 --> 36:54.417
LOOK, I TRIED TO HELP OUT.

36:54.417 --> 36:55.875
HANNAH DUG HER HEELS IN.

36:55.875 --> 36:57.208
WOULDN'T LET ANYBODY
NEAR BEVERLY.

36:57.208 --> 36:58.709
- WHICH MEANS HANNAH
WAS THE ONLY ONE

36:58.709 --> 37:01.667
WHO HAD THE ACCESS
TO POISON HER.

37:06.375 --> 37:09.250
HEY, HANNAH MENTIONED
A PURPLE WILDFLOWER

37:09.250 --> 37:10.959
THAT GROWS
ON THE PROPERTY.

37:10.959 --> 37:12.458
THOUGHT IT WOULD
LOOK GREAT IN MY PLACE.

37:12.458 --> 37:16.125
I'M THINKING I COULD
TAKE A LOOK WHILE I WAIT.

37:16.125 --> 37:20.125
- ALL THE WILDFLOWERS ARE OVER
IN THE SOUTHWEST CORNER.

37:20.125 --> 37:26.250
[insects chirping, flitting]

37:38.417 --> 37:40.792
- ACONITE.

37:40.792 --> 37:43.625
- PRICE IS RIGHT.
YET AGAIN.

37:43.625 --> 37:44.834
- BEAUTIFUL AND DANGEROUS.

37:44.834 --> 37:50.458
JUST LIKE HANNAH.

37:51.750 --> 37:54.083
SHE'S HARVESTED IT.

37:54.083 --> 37:56.750
- MAYBE SHE'S SET HER SIGHTS
ON A NEW TARGET.

37:56.750 --> 37:58.542
YOU'RE AFTER HER.

37:58.542 --> 38:01.750
WHO'S TO SAY
SHE ISN'T AFTER YOU?

38:01.750 --> 38:05.250
- BUT WHY?

38:05.250 --> 38:06.333
SHE DOESN'T THINK
I'M A THREAT.

38:06.333 --> 38:07.667
SHE ACCEPTED MY APOLOGY.

38:07.667 --> 38:09.166
- DON'T BE NAIVE, DEXTER.

38:09.166 --> 38:12.083
YOU THINK SHE'S A KILLER,
BUT NOT A LIAR?

38:12.083 --> 38:15.166
- DEXTER?

38:15.166 --> 38:16.959
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

38:16.959 --> 38:18.792
- I WAS, UH...
[chuckles]

38:18.792 --> 38:21.417
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

38:21.417 --> 38:22.792
- WELL, COME ON IN.

38:22.792 --> 38:26.000
I'LL MAKE SOME COFFEE.

38:36.709 --> 38:39.583
CAREFUL, IT'S HOT.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.667
- AND POTENTIALLY DEADLY.

38:45.667 --> 38:47.166
[sighs]

38:47.166 --> 38:50.917
HANNAH, I WISH I HAD MORE TIME,
BUT I GOTTA GET TO WORK.

38:50.917 --> 38:52.333
- YOU KNOW,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU, DEXTER.

38:52.333 --> 38:54.667
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
WHAT IT IS

38:54.667 --> 38:56.291
THAT YOU REALLY WANT.

38:56.291 --> 38:57.333
- NOTHING.
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING.

38:57.333 --> 38:59.166
- YOU OBVIOUSLY
WANT SOMETHING.

38:59.166 --> 39:01.000
YOU KEEP MAKING EXCUSES
TO SEE ME.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.333
- THEY WEREN'T EXCUSES.

39:02.333 --> 39:03.583
- IT'S HONESTLY GETTING
A LITTLE CREEPY

39:03.583 --> 39:04.917
THAT YOU KEEP COMING BY.

39:04.917 --> 39:06.667
- CREEPY?
YOU CAME TO MY PLACE TOO.

39:06.667 --> 39:08.542
- WELL THEN WHY DON'T YOU JUST
SAVE US BOTH THE TROUBLE,

39:08.542 --> 39:09.834
AND SPIT IT OUT.

39:09.834 --> 39:11.875
- I WANT TO TAKE YOU OUT.

39:11.875 --> 39:14.083
- ON A DATE?

39:14.083 --> 39:15.375
- THAT'LL WORK.

39:15.375 --> 39:18.917
- WELL, THAT'S SWEET.

39:18.917 --> 39:23.667
BUT I DON'T DATE.

39:23.667 --> 39:25.125
I GET TOO ATTACHED.

39:25.125 --> 39:27.291
- REALLY? YOU DON'T STRIKE
ME AS THE TYPE.

39:27.291 --> 39:29.000
- WELL, I'M NOT
WHO PEOPLE THINK I AM.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.917
- SO WHO ARE YOU?

39:31.917 --> 39:35.041
- ON THE INSIDE?

39:35.041 --> 39:37.083
PROBABLY STILL THAT
15-YEAR-OLD GIRL

39:37.083 --> 39:38.750
WHO RAN AWAY
WITH WAYNE RANDALL.

39:38.750 --> 39:41.500
- THE GIRL WHO STABBED
A WOMAN IN COLD BLOOD.

39:41.500 --> 39:44.875
- EXCEPT NOW, I KNOW BETTER.

39:44.875 --> 39:46.208
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

39:46.208 --> 39:49.959
- I MEAN, HE PROMISED
ME EVERYTHING.

39:49.959 --> 39:51.041
HE WAS GONNA TAKE
ME TO DISNEY WORLD,

39:51.041 --> 39:55.083
AND SANTA'S HOLIDAY ADVENTURE.

39:55.083 --> 39:58.709
SOME LITTLE CHRISTMAS-THEMED
SHITHOLE JUST OUTSIDE OF MIAMI.

39:58.709 --> 39:59.709
YOU KNOW IT?

39:59.709 --> 40:05.166
- MM-MM.

40:05.166 --> 40:08.792
- IT'S THE ONLY PLACE IN FLORIDA
WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE SNOW.

40:08.792 --> 40:11.917
I WAS OBSESSED.

40:11.917 --> 40:14.375
THEN WE WERE GONNA LIVE
IN ARGENTINA, ON A FARM,

40:14.375 --> 40:16.333
AND HAVE THIS
PICTURE-PERFECT LIFE.

40:16.333 --> 40:18.375
- SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD TO ME.

40:18.375 --> 40:21.875
- IT WAS ALL
I COULD THINK ABOUT.

40:21.875 --> 40:23.583
I LONGED FOR IT.

40:23.583 --> 40:26.667
I NEEDED IT, AND I KNEW
THAT UNTIL I HAD IT,

40:26.667 --> 40:29.250
I WOULD NEVER BE SATISFIED.

40:29.250 --> 40:30.583
THE CRAZIEST PART IS

40:30.583 --> 40:32.500
THAT SOMEHOW
I HAD MYSELF CONVINCED

40:32.500 --> 40:34.875
THAT WAYNE WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO COULD GIVE IT TO ME.

40:34.875 --> 40:37.250
- WAYNE? REALLY?

40:37.250 --> 40:39.709
WHY?

40:39.709 --> 40:44.458
- I HAD IT IN MY HEAD
THAT HE WAS THE ANSWER.

40:44.458 --> 40:49.583
THAT HE WAS GONNA FILL THE
EMPTINESS THAT I FELT INSIDE.

40:49.583 --> 40:53.458
SO I DIDN'T CARE WHEN
HE TURNED OUT TO BE THE BAD GUY.

40:53.458 --> 40:56.500
I DIDN'T CARE
IF HE SHOT SOMEBODY.

40:56.500 --> 41:00.291
I DIDN'T EVEN CARE
IF I ENDED UP IN JUVIE.

41:00.291 --> 41:04.458
NOT UNTIL LATER, ANYWAY.
[sighs]

41:04.458 --> 41:07.750
IT WAS WORTH IT...

41:07.750 --> 41:12.041
JUST TO HOLD ON
TO THE FANTASY.

41:12.041 --> 41:17.709
- YOU STILL FEEL THAT WAY?

41:17.709 --> 41:19.959
- NO. NOW I DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO MAKE SURE I DON'T

41:19.959 --> 41:24.750
LOSE MYSELF LIKE THAT AGAIN.

41:24.750 --> 41:27.333
BUT I DO STILL WISH
I HAD GOTTEN TO SEE THE SNOW.

41:33.458 --> 41:35.417
- YOU KNOW
I'M NOT WAYNE, RIGHT?

41:43.417 --> 41:45.792
I'M NOT GONNA
LAND YOU IN JAIL.

41:45.792 --> 41:47.750
- I STILL THINK
IT'S A BAD IDEA.

41:47.750 --> 41:49.375
- THEN WHY'D YOU COME
TO MY APARTMENT?

41:49.375 --> 41:51.125
- YOU KNOW WHY.

41:51.125 --> 41:54.875
- GO OUT WITH ME.

41:54.875 --> 41:59.000
COME ON, I'M JUST GONNA
KEEP STALKING YOU.

42:01.375 --> 42:03.709
- I'M JUST--I'M JUST TRYING
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

42:03.709 --> 42:08.709
- DO THE WRONG THING.

42:08.709 --> 42:10.542
- FINE.

42:10.542 --> 42:13.250
ONE DATE.

42:13.250 --> 42:14.500
BUT IF I END UP IN JAIL--

42:14.500 --> 42:19.500
- I'LL PICK YOU UP AT 8:00.

42:26.375 --> 42:27.834
- A DATE?

42:27.834 --> 42:29.500
REALLY?

42:29.500 --> 42:32.000
- SHE CAUGHT ME OFF-GUARD.
I HAD TO THINK OF SOMETHING.

42:35.041 --> 42:37.500
[ignition turns, engine starts]

42:39.041 --> 42:41.125
- NADIA, IT'S JOEY.

42:41.125 --> 42:43.041
I STOPPED BY THE CLUB LAST NIGHT
AND YOU WEREN'T THERE.

42:43.041 --> 42:44.208
I KNOW I'VE CALLED,
LIKE, 50 TIMES.

42:44.208 --> 42:45.875
I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

42:45.875 --> 42:49.083
PLEASE, CALL ME BACK.
LET ME KNOW YOU'RE OKAY.

42:49.083 --> 42:50.834
[phone beeps]

42:50.834 --> 42:52.375
- YOU GOT A SEC?
- NOT REALLY, I--

42:52.375 --> 42:54.709
- DO I SEEM IMPULSIVE TO YOU?

42:54.709 --> 42:57.041
JAMIE SAYS
I MAKE BAD DECISIONS.

42:57.041 --> 43:00.917
BUT I HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY,
AND I'M THINKING ABOUT RETIRING.

43:00.917 --> 43:03.000
- HOLY SHIT.
YOU'RE RETIRING?

43:03.000 --> 43:05.500
- NO, I-I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
I'M JUST CONSIDERING MY OPTIONS.

43:05.500 --> 43:09.750
- CAN WE TALK LATER?
I GOT SHIT TO DO.

43:09.750 --> 43:11.458
- HEY, L.T., DID YOU KNOW
ANGEL'S THINKING ABOUT RETIRING?

43:11.458 --> 43:14.750
- MASUKA!
- IS THAT TRUE?

43:14.750 --> 43:18.000
- I WANT TO BUY
A RESTAURANT.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.709
- WILL YOU GIVE US A MINUTE?
- YEAH, FINE.

43:19.709 --> 43:21.500
BUT FOR THE RECORD,
STUDIES SHOW THAT MEN WHO RETIRE

43:21.500 --> 43:23.417
ARE USUALLY DEAD
IN FIVE YEARS.

43:23.417 --> 43:26.709
IT'S A FACT.
LOOK IT UP.

43:32.417 --> 43:37.291
- WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?

43:37.291 --> 43:40.208
IS THIS ABOUT MIKE ANDERSON'S
MURDER, 'CAUSE...

43:40.208 --> 43:41.458
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.

43:41.458 --> 43:44.834
- I THINK I'M BURNT OUT, DEB.

43:44.834 --> 43:47.417
I DON'T DATE.

43:47.417 --> 43:50.458
I HARDLY SEE MY KID.

43:50.458 --> 43:51.917
I'M SO FOCUSED ON WORK THAT

43:51.917 --> 43:54.542
I FORGOT TO HAVE A LIFE.

43:54.542 --> 43:56.083
AND I KNOW
THIS MAY SOUND CRAZY,

43:56.083 --> 43:59.500
BUT THE IDEA
OF BUYING THIS RESTAURANT

43:59.500 --> 44:03.291
ACTUALLY MAKES ME HAPPY.

44:06.500 --> 44:09.417
- DOESN'T SOUND CRAZY AT ALL.

44:38.542 --> 44:42.208
[phone dialing]

44:42.208 --> 44:44.875
[beep]
[line ringing]

44:44.875 --> 44:46.291
- SAL PRICE.

44:46.291 --> 44:48.792
- SAL, HEY.
IT'S DEBRA MORGAN, FROM--

44:48.792 --> 44:51.417
- LIEUTENANT MORGAN,
WITH THE POTTY MOUTH.

44:51.417 --> 44:53.125
- RIGHT, WITH THE POTTY MOUTH.

44:53.125 --> 44:54.834
- TO WHAT DO I OWE
THIS UNEXPECTED PLEASURE?

44:54.834 --> 44:56.333
- ARE YOU STILL
UP FOR THAT DRINK?

44:56.333 --> 44:58.667
- YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

44:58.667 --> 45:01.375
BUT, I THOUGHT YOU SAID--
- I THINK I NEED TO GET A LIFE.

45:01.375 --> 45:03.208
- YES, YOU DO.

45:10.333 --> 45:12.500
- CASE NUMBER?
- 98760.

45:12.500 --> 45:15.375
[keyboard clicking]

45:15.375 --> 45:19.208
THAT'S, UH, DIXON CASE.

45:19.208 --> 45:21.208
I-I GOTTA TESTIFY
IN COURT NEXT WEEK.

45:21.208 --> 45:24.250
NEED A REFRESHER
ON THE EVIDENCE.

45:24.250 --> 45:26.417
- DRY SECTION.
BIN 51, SHELF 4.

45:26.417 --> 45:31.208
THIRD ONE OVER.
BACK, AND TO THE RIGHT.

45:31.208 --> 45:33.625
[door buzzing]

45:33.625 --> 45:36.667
CASE NUMBER?
- CASE 16258.

45:36.667 --> 45:38.375
LAYVA.

45:38.375 --> 45:39.834
SHOULD BE TWO OR THREE BOXES.

45:39.834 --> 45:43.583
IT GOES TO ARRAIGNMENT
NEXT MONTH.

45:48.583 --> 45:53.625
[indistinct chatter]

45:53.625 --> 45:56.792
[machinery humming]

46:26.750 --> 46:30.250
- [sighs]

46:30.250 --> 46:33.750
FUCK ME.

46:33.750 --> 46:36.083
[Latin music]

46:36.083 --> 46:40.083
- ORAL FIXATION?

46:40.083 --> 46:42.291
- SORRY. BAD HABIT.

46:42.291 --> 46:43.917
WHEN I QUIT DRINKING,
I PICKED UP SMOKING.

46:43.917 --> 46:46.625
WHEN I QUIT SMOKING,
I PICKED UP CHEWING ON THINGS.

46:46.625 --> 46:48.959
STRAWS, PENS, TOOTHPICKS.

46:48.959 --> 46:51.333
TURNS OUT I HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH MODERATION.

46:51.333 --> 46:52.667
- ME TOO.

46:52.667 --> 46:54.667
THAT, AND
AN OBSESSIVE PERSONALITY.

46:54.667 --> 46:56.917
WHICH IS GREAT FOR WORK,
BUT IT'S...

46:56.917 --> 46:58.709
REALLY SHITTY
FOR RELATIONSHIPS.

46:58.709 --> 47:03.250
- ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT ME OR YOU?

47:03.250 --> 47:04.709
- SO WHAT ARE YOU WORKING
ON RIGHT NOW?

47:04.709 --> 47:07.458
YOU'RE UPDATING
YOUR BOOK, RIGHT?

47:07.458 --> 47:09.041
- THAT, AND ANOTHER PROJECT.

47:09.041 --> 47:11.917
WHICH I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T TELL
YOU ABOUT.

47:11.917 --> 47:13.959
- WHY, IS IT A SECRET?

47:13.959 --> 47:15.333
'CAUSE TRUST ME,
I CAN KEEP A SECRET.

47:15.333 --> 47:17.875
- I DON'T KNOW.

47:17.875 --> 47:19.333
YOU'RE THE LIEUTENANT
OF HOMICIDE,

47:19.333 --> 47:21.333
AND USUALLY WHEN
I TELL COPS ABOUT MY THEORIES,

47:21.333 --> 47:23.834
THEY TELL ME
TO GO FUCK MYSELF.

47:23.834 --> 47:28.208
- THAT WON'T HAPPEN HERE.
I PROMISE.

47:28.208 --> 47:31.166
COME ON,
DON'T BE A COP-TEASE.

47:31.166 --> 47:36.041
A GOOD THEORY TOTALLY
GIVES ME A GIRL BONER.

47:36.041 --> 47:38.542
- OKAY.

47:38.542 --> 47:40.000
OFF THE RECORD.
- MM-HMM.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.333
- YOU KNOW ALL THAT STUFF
IN MY FIRST BOOK

47:42.333 --> 47:44.875
ABOUT HANNAH MCKAY BEING
THIS INNOCENT YOUNG GIRL?

47:44.875 --> 47:47.250
A VICTIM
OF WAYNE RANDALL'S INFLUENCE?

47:47.250 --> 47:48.500
- YEAH.

47:48.500 --> 47:52.375
- WELL, I THINK IT'S BOGUS.

47:52.375 --> 47:55.792
I THINK HANNAH KILLED HER FIRST
VICTIM RIGHT ALONG WITH WAYNE.

47:55.792 --> 47:57.667
AND I THINK SHE KEPT RIGHT
ON KILLING.

47:57.667 --> 48:00.041
- GO FUCK YOURSELF.

48:00.041 --> 48:02.208
IF THAT'S TRUE,
WE'RE TOTALLY FUCKED.

48:02.208 --> 48:04.458
WE GAVE HER IMMUNITY.
- IT'S TRUE.

48:04.458 --> 48:06.083
I HAVE EVIDENCE
TO BACK IT UP.

48:06.083 --> 48:08.291
IT'S IN MY BAG RIGHT NOW.

48:08.291 --> 48:10.375
- WAIT, YOU HAVE IT HERE?
- WHY, DO YOU WANT TO SEE IT?

48:10.375 --> 48:11.750
- PRICE, YOU HAVE
TO SHOW IT TO ME.

48:11.750 --> 48:13.166
I'M THE LIEUTENANT
OF HOMICIDE.

48:13.166 --> 48:17.458
- LOOK AT YOU.
LIKE A DOG WITH A BONE.

48:17.458 --> 48:18.959
- IF YOU SHOW IT TO ME,

48:18.959 --> 48:24.208
I'LL TOTALLY
MAKE OUT WITH YOU.

48:24.208 --> 48:25.417
- BEST FIRST DATE EVER.

48:25.417 --> 48:28.041
[laughter]

48:28.041 --> 48:31.041
OKAY.

48:31.041 --> 48:34.208
SO THESE ARE
THE SPATTER PHOTOS

48:34.208 --> 48:36.041
FROM THE BODIES YOU DUG UP.

48:36.041 --> 48:37.375
- I'VE SEEN THOSE.

48:37.375 --> 48:39.166
DEXTER SAID THE EVIDENCE
WAS INCONCLUSIVE.

48:39.166 --> 48:40.583
- MY BLOOD GUY DISAGREED.

48:40.583 --> 48:41.625
- WELL, THERE'S NO WAY.

48:41.625 --> 48:42.917
MY BROTHER'S NEVER WRONG.

48:42.917 --> 48:44.458
- MY GUY SAID
THE VOID PATTERN

48:44.458 --> 48:45.917
ON THIS BODY
INDICATES A KILLER

48:45.917 --> 48:48.125
MUCH SMALLER
THAN WAYNE RANDALL.

48:48.125 --> 48:51.625
- SMALLER.

48:51.625 --> 48:56.041
SMALLER LIKE HANNAH MCKAY?

49:00.917 --> 49:04.709
FUCK BALLS.

49:04.709 --> 49:08.625
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

49:08.625 --> 49:14.709
[wind whipping]

49:28.458 --> 49:31.792
- I THOUGHT THIS PLACE
WAS CLOSED FOR THE SEASON.

49:31.792 --> 49:33.959
- IT IS.

49:33.959 --> 49:37.125
- SO HOW ARE WE GONNA GET IN?

49:37.125 --> 49:42.125
- HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
A LITTLE BREAKING AND ENTERING?

49:42.125 --> 49:43.709
- [giggling]

49:43.709 --> 49:47.250
YEAH.

49:54.959 --> 49:56.792
- ALL OF US HAVE
SOME KIND OF LONGING.

49:56.792 --> 50:00.333
A NEED CRYING OUT TO BE MET.

50:25.542 --> 50:27.542
- WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
- SHH.

50:27.542 --> 50:29.667
WAIT.

50:29.667 --> 50:35.500
[electric humming]

50:37.208 --> 50:39.500
- SOME OF US GET WHAT WE WANT,
AND WE'RE HAPPY.

50:39.500 --> 50:43.750
- THE SNOW.

50:43.750 --> 50:44.917
- I THOUGHT
MAYBE IF YOU SAW IT,

50:44.917 --> 50:47.083
YOU COULD FINALLY
GET SOME PEACE.

50:47.083 --> 50:49.750
- [gasps]

50:49.750 --> 50:54.166
THANK YOU.

50:54.166 --> 51:00.208
THANK YOU.

51:03.875 --> 51:05.792
- BUT SOME OF US
ARE NEVER SATISFIED.

51:05.792 --> 51:09.583
- [exhales]

51:14.917 --> 51:17.375
[breathing heavily]

51:21.667 --> 51:24.834
[blades clinking]

51:27.750 --> 51:30.875
[metallic scrape]

51:33.917 --> 51:35.625
- WHEN I SAID I WANTED
TO TAKE YOU OUT,

51:35.625 --> 51:37.917
THIS IS WHAT I MEANT.

51:37.917 --> 51:41.917
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO SEE THE SNOW.

51:41.917 --> 51:48.000
THIS IS WHAT KEEPS
ME UP AT NIGHT.

51:48.000 --> 51:52.542
THIS IS WHAT I LONG FOR.

51:54.750 --> 51:58.500
THIS IS WHAT I NEED TO...

51:58.500 --> 52:01.625
FILL MY EMPTINESS.

52:01.625 --> 52:05.417
- [grunts]

52:06.583 --> 52:08.709
[grunts]

52:12.041 --> 52:17.458
DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

52:37.375 --> 52:40.250
[exhales deeply]

52:46.166 --> 52:49.166
DEXTER.

52:51.166 --> 52:54.291
[heavy breathing]

53:14.583 --> 53:17.333
OH.

53:17.333 --> 53:22.959
[moans]

53:22.959 --> 53:26.166
[both moaning and panting]
