00:30.830 --> 00:33.050
They're definitely dragon corps.

00:33.470 --> 00:36.010
They're darken rahl's
personal errand boys.

00:36.110 --> 00:39.140
And they never stray
far from their master.

00:39.150 --> 00:41.960
Fortune has shined on
us today, my friends.

00:42.070 --> 00:44.440
All we have to do is
stay on their heels,

00:44.450 --> 00:46.870
And the mice will lead us to the cheese.

00:47.180 --> 00:49.300
Are you ready to face darken rahl, boy?

00:55.210 --> 00:58.210
What figure did you have
in your head, peddler?

00:58.220 --> 01:02.460
Twenty thousand pieces of
gold, and that's my best price.

01:02.470 --> 01:05.420
For that much, I'll need to see
if the merchandise is genuine.

01:05.430 --> 01:08.610
Nobody said anything
about services for free.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.410
Well, I'm saying it now.

01:16.700 --> 01:18.120
What do you think they're buying?

01:19.250 --> 01:22.170
Magical weapon, torture device.

01:25.900 --> 01:27.270
It's a boy!

01:29.680 --> 01:32.440
We're no good to the
child if we're dead.

01:36.980 --> 01:38.700
Legend of the Seeker S01E05 Listener

01:41.370 --> 01:43.400
Let's see if you're the real thing.

01:43.630 --> 01:47.320
What did my wife make me for breakfast
the day I left on this expedition?

01:50.270 --> 01:53.820
It's not the lumpy porridge and the
greasy eggs you're thinking about.

01:54.460 --> 01:57.030
It's the black eye she
gave you the night before.

02:00.720 --> 02:04.250
Tell me something about one
of my men that I don't know.

02:04.580 --> 02:06.010
Take your helmets off.

02:06.020 --> 02:08.190
He needs to see right into your eyes.

02:21.630 --> 02:23.230
There's nothing to tell.

02:23.240 --> 02:26.420
Not one of my men has something in
his head that I don't know about?

02:27.680 --> 02:29.190
Not impressive.

02:29.370 --> 02:31.980
We've come a long way
for nothing. March.

02:31.990 --> 02:34.150
Tell the man what he wants to know.

02:34.160 --> 02:36.060
He's thinking about the seeker.

02:39.010 --> 02:40.980
We're all thinking about the seeker.

02:40.990 --> 02:42.670
Not the way he is.

02:43.620 --> 02:46.390
He's hoping the seeker
kills darken rahl.

02:47.220 --> 02:51.550
He's planning to kill darken rahl
himself, if he ever gets him alone.

02:54.930 --> 02:57.250
You want time alone with lord rahl?

02:57.450 --> 02:59.520
I can arrange that, masslar.

03:04.710 --> 03:06.790
Lord rahl is gonna be very happy.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.270
Do you know what he is?

03:11.280 --> 03:13.340
He can see what people are thinking.

03:13.380 --> 03:17.120
The way you and I would read a
list of things to buy at the market.

03:17.890 --> 03:19.800
He is a true listener.

03:19.890 --> 03:22.370
In our time, I never thought I'd see it.

03:22.380 --> 03:25.020
The last true listener
died 700 years ago.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.130
We have to get that boy away.

03:29.140 --> 03:31.380
Yes, but not yet. What?

03:31.390 --> 03:34.250
If we track them, they'll lead
us straight to darken rahl.

03:34.730 --> 03:36.210
They won't hurt him.

03:36.840 --> 03:38.240
He's too precious to them.

03:38.250 --> 03:40.800
We can't let rahl get
control of that type of power.

03:40.810 --> 03:42.720
If he knew what
people think-- richard.

03:42.730 --> 03:45.840
If we follow them, we can
find rahl and kill him.

03:45.850 --> 03:47.720
And the boy will be safe forever.

03:47.730 --> 03:48.950
You do what you want.

03:48.960 --> 03:52.020
But I'm getting him away from them now.

03:52.740 --> 03:54.300
Young people.

03:54.310 --> 03:57.050
Everything is black
and white, either-or,

03:57.060 --> 04:02.500
Free the boy, follow the boy,maybe
there's a way we can do both.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.980
So no one will recognize
you as the great wizard,

04:26.990 --> 04:30.820
Zeddicus zu'l zorander, but
how are we gonna save the boy?

04:30.830 --> 04:32.160
With this.

04:32.680 --> 04:35.560
I've being saving her for a rainy day

04:35.890 --> 04:39.020
I say it's pouring at
the moment,Wouldn't you?

04:56.130 --> 04:57.350
Shadow people.

04:57.750 --> 04:59.010
Stay back!

05:12.040 --> 05:14.040
To whom do I owe my thanks?

05:14.100 --> 05:15.990
Grannack the great,

05:16.000 --> 05:19.120
Wizard of the first order.

05:19.450 --> 05:22.580
I've been after those monsters for days.

05:22.590 --> 05:24.940
There's a rift to the underworld
somewhere in these parts.

05:24.950 --> 05:28.150
Shadow people have been
escaping left and right.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.500
Forgive me if I caught
you in the crossfire.

05:31.130 --> 05:34.000
And whom do I have the
honor of addressing?

05:34.010 --> 05:35.450
Captain ashgar.

05:36.270 --> 05:39.270
Dragon corps. Now that's a bit of luck.

05:39.380 --> 05:42.450
There aren't many who can
afford real talent nowadays.

05:42.460 --> 05:45.070
I was hoping perhaps the house of rahl

05:45.080 --> 05:48.890
Might see the value
in what I can provide

05:49.020 --> 05:52.080
You want us to bring you into
the presence of lord rahl?

05:52.300 --> 05:54.710
A great wizard meet with a great patron.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.050
There are many who would like nothing

05:56.060 --> 05:58.550
More than to stand before darken rahl.

05:58.680 --> 06:02.470
Some as friends, some as spies.

06:06.870 --> 06:08.850
Let's see which you are.

06:09.330 --> 06:12.550
Kranthor, bring out the listener.

06:21.260 --> 06:22.510
He's gone!

06:26.180 --> 06:27.500
Find him!

06:27.510 --> 06:28.930
Put me down!

06:31.100 --> 06:33.360
It's okay. We're friends.

06:33.580 --> 06:35.810
We just wanna take you home.

06:50.980 --> 06:53.280
If you run, they'll
just catch you again.

06:53.290 --> 06:54.840
That's okay with me.

06:55.060 --> 06:58.140
They're gonna give me
my own room. In a castle.

06:58.560 --> 07:02.540
You just better hope they
don't catch you, seeker.

07:02.680 --> 07:05.090
Killing you is all
they ever think about.

07:06.200 --> 07:09.340
So, what are you gonna do, sell me?

07:09.640 --> 07:11.710
Or use me yourself?

07:11.950 --> 07:14.980
I'll tell you right
now, that'll cost you.

07:14.990 --> 07:16.790
Where do your parents live?

07:17.310 --> 07:18.580
Just my father.

07:18.590 --> 07:21.300
My mother died before they took me away.

07:22.340 --> 07:23.960
Before who took you away?

07:23.990 --> 07:27.110
Some man who used me to cheat at cards.

07:27.120 --> 07:28.880
We don't have time to talk.

07:29.320 --> 07:31.740
We can't let darken
rahl get ahold of you.

07:31.870 --> 07:34.150
Where was home? Where
did they take you from?

07:34.160 --> 07:35.430
Obregon woods.

07:35.440 --> 07:37.170
That's just over the grey hills.

07:37.280 --> 07:39.100
If we walked all night, we
could be there by morning

07:39.100 --> 07:41.170
And then head straight
back and follow zedd

07:41.500 --> 07:43.850
Whoever took him knows
how to cover his tracks.

07:43.860 --> 07:45.980
Take half the men and find him.

07:45.990 --> 07:47.150
Take Ranick.

07:47.160 --> 07:49.220
He could track a
snowflake in a blizzard.

07:49.660 --> 07:51.430
I'll face lord rahl.

07:51.860 --> 07:53.230
The only thing he hates more than bad

07:53.240 --> 07:55.270
News is having bad news kept from him.

07:57.650 --> 08:00.600
Surely turning up with a
wizard of the first order in tow

08:00.600 --> 08:02.230
Will temper his wrath.

08:02.310 --> 08:04.550
His wrath isn't easily tempered.

08:09.340 --> 08:12.390
Chain the traitor to the
horse. We march all night.

08:14.870 --> 08:16.940
Don't take your eyes off the wizard.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.350
Are we close?

08:26.000 --> 08:27.620
I used to climb that tree.

08:33.320 --> 08:34.909
That's my house.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.110
Dad!

08:48.130 --> 08:49.610
That's not him.

08:51.870 --> 08:52.940
Excuse me.

08:52.950 --> 08:54.870
Um, there was a man
that used to live here.

08:54.880 --> 08:57.080
He had a little boy who was kidnapped.

08:57.960 --> 08:59.800
Do you know where we might find him?

09:00.060 --> 09:01.440
I'm sorry, I don't.

09:01.450 --> 09:04.030
I moved in a long time
after he moved away.

09:04.150 --> 09:05.620
All I heard was...

09:08.940 --> 09:10.140
What?

09:10.410 --> 09:11.710
What did you hear?

09:13.920 --> 09:15.580
Not in front of the boy.

09:21.200 --> 09:24.190
Renn, what is it?

09:26.660 --> 09:29.110
He heard that I wasn't kidnapped.

09:32.270 --> 09:34.910
He heard that my father sold me.

09:35.830 --> 09:38.280
For a thousand pieces of gold.

09:53.900 --> 09:55.520
Maybe it's not true.

09:56.080 --> 09:58.070
Maybe it's just a rumor he heard.

09:59.780 --> 10:02.000
You know when you pick up a rock

10:02.000 --> 10:06.430
And there's all these disgusting bugs
and worms crawling around under it.

10:07.080 --> 10:10.300
That's what looking inside
peoples' heads is like.

10:13.380 --> 10:16.160
Why should my father be any different?

10:18.420 --> 10:19.710
Kahlan.

10:25.460 --> 10:27.510
I've talked to anybody I could find.

10:27.810 --> 10:30.180
He has no family here.

10:30.690 --> 10:32.270
We have to get to zedd.

10:32.280 --> 10:34.550
A chance like this,
to get close to rahl...

10:34.730 --> 10:36.290
We're not leaving him with strangers.

10:36.300 --> 10:37.600
Of course we're not.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.690
There's a place called thandor.

10:42.700 --> 10:46.450
It's a hidden valley,
magically hidden from all evil.

10:46.650 --> 10:49.400
The sisters of light
protect children like him.

10:49.410 --> 10:50.900
Children with gifts.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.230
How long will it take to get there?

10:53.390 --> 10:55.570
Three days. Maybe four.

10:55.720 --> 10:57.090
We'll make it three.

10:58.300 --> 10:59.760
You tell him, I'll pack up.

11:01.400 --> 11:02.630
Richard.

11:03.070 --> 11:05.140
Oh, no. We have to race.

11:05.150 --> 11:07.800
The trail zedd's leaving for us,
we don't know how long it'll last.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.210
Renn!

11:11.410 --> 11:13.260
Renn! Renn!

11:17.300 --> 11:18.960
Tell me, captain ashgar,

11:18.960 --> 11:21.360
How many houses have you
personally burned to the ground

11:21.360 --> 11:23.420
With residents still inside?

11:23.420 --> 11:27.110
I'm under orders to deliver tradors'
life for questioning, masslar,

11:27.110 --> 11:28.320
But I'm warning you.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.320
When your mother
bounced you on her knee,

11:30.330 --> 11:32.400
Did she say, "oh, what
a wonderful little boy

11:32.410 --> 11:33.950
"someday you'll grow up to burn the eyes

11:33.960 --> 11:36.310
Out of innocent men
with red hot iron stakes"

11:38.950 --> 11:40.850
One-minute stop for water.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.570
No water for the traitor.

12:03.570 --> 12:04.950
Stop him!

12:12.750 --> 12:15.060
If our wizard of the first
order is so eager to be helpful,

12:15.070 --> 12:17.570
Why is he standing there
with his hands at his side.

12:17.940 --> 12:20.430
Beyond your powers, grannack the great

12:21.410 --> 12:23.280
Patience, captain.

12:23.290 --> 12:27.810
I'm gathering the magical forces
necessary for a spell of this magnitude.

12:44.510 --> 12:46.240
It seems I have a more valuable and more

12:46.250 --> 12:49.340
Reliable gift for lord
rahl than I first thought.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.720
Six pieces of silver.

13:14.010 --> 13:19.560
Six pieces of silver,
and two pieces of gold.

13:25.960 --> 13:27.470
The rose.

13:28.310 --> 13:29.770
The lion.

13:30.360 --> 13:31.890
And the bull.

13:36.660 --> 13:38.100
The lion.

13:39.410 --> 13:40.760
The lion.

13:42.140 --> 13:43.510
And the star.

13:45.270 --> 13:48.210
What sort of trick do you
think you're playing, boy?

13:48.220 --> 13:49.350
Let him go!

13:51.640 --> 13:54.740
A flagon of ale for whoever
gets these people out of here.

13:54.750 --> 13:56.650
You are coming with me. Hey!

13:56.860 --> 13:58.760
That was my money. I won it!

13:58.770 --> 14:00.180
No, you stole it.

14:00.190 --> 14:02.340
You cheated. I let you take me home,

14:02.350 --> 14:05.370
But I'm not going to some
orphanage for weird children

14:05.380 --> 14:06.740
I'm my own boss now.

14:06.750 --> 14:08.560
You're not telling me what to do.

14:08.570 --> 14:10.750
No, you have to come with us so we can

14:10.760 --> 14:12.710
Take you to thandor and
get back to our friend

14:12.720 --> 14:14.420
This may be hard for you to comprehend,

14:14.430 --> 14:17.310
But the fate of the world
just might depend on it.

14:19.060 --> 14:21.990
Okay. All right, I'm
sorry to have to do this.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.070
But I can't let you run away again.

14:24.210 --> 14:25.840
Don't! Unh!

14:29.700 --> 14:31.910
You will not bind his hands!

14:31.970 --> 14:33.230
It's ok, I am not gonna hurt him.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.810
I'm just gonna
make sure-- no!

14:34.940 --> 14:36.210
You will not.

14:41.730 --> 14:44.120
Okay, fine. How about this?

14:45.880 --> 14:48.520
If you run away again, I'm gonna
take you back to that tarvern

14:48.520 --> 14:51.040
And tell that gambler
how you cheated him

15:08.260 --> 15:11.270
Why don't you tell him why
the rope upsets you so much?

15:22.040 --> 15:25.420
Sorry it has to be cold, but we
have no time to get a fire going.

15:27.440 --> 15:28.990
I'm not eating that.

15:29.190 --> 15:31.260
Come on, it's not bad, really.

15:31.790 --> 15:34.380
I want pheasant with blackberry sauce.

15:34.390 --> 15:35.610
Don't we all.

15:35.660 --> 15:38.320
That's what the prince of
aspasia used to give to me.

15:38.890 --> 15:41.090
Every night of the week if I wanted it.

15:41.590 --> 15:44.500
Or he could forget about
knowing which one of his wives

15:44.500 --> 15:46.950
Was sleeping with the
captain of the guard.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.720
Well, the first pheasant
i see is all yours.

15:49.730 --> 15:51.980
I saw a nest of pheasants a mile back,

15:51.990 --> 15:53.900
And there were blackberries
growing all over.

15:53.910 --> 15:55.220
No, no. We don't have time.

15:55.620 --> 15:58.320
If you're in a hurry,
I'm not stopping you.

15:58.430 --> 16:01.390
I'll just wait right here
for the d'harans to find me.

16:01.400 --> 16:06.690
Listen, we're not stopping to pick
blackberries and hunt pheasant.

16:08.160 --> 16:09.660
Then I guess I'll have to tell her

16:09.670 --> 16:12.090
About the secret you've
been keeping from her

16:16.560 --> 16:18.510
I don't have any secrets from kahlan.

16:18.520 --> 16:19.850
I'm a listener.

16:19.860 --> 16:22.490
Do you think there's
anything you can hide from me?

16:22.500 --> 16:26.480
How would you like her to know what
you think about when you look at her?

16:37.020 --> 16:38.550
Mm. Not bad.

16:38.560 --> 16:39.920
Could use salt.

16:40.180 --> 16:41.890
Okay, that's enough. Come on.

16:41.900 --> 16:44.870
I need to rest a little
after all that food.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.790
It was extremely kind of richard to go

16:52.800 --> 16:54.780
To all the trouble of cooking you this.

16:54.950 --> 17:00.280
Try to understand how important
it is for all of us to keep moving.

17:01.340 --> 17:03.250
I'm not ready to start walking.

17:03.260 --> 17:05.020
That...Is enough!

17:05.030 --> 17:06.569
On your feet now!

17:06.589 --> 17:08.619
He wants to kill me. I saw it!

17:08.630 --> 17:10.079
He wants to kill me!

17:10.089 --> 17:11.310
He's not gonna kill you.

17:11.319 --> 17:13.349
It was just something that he thought.

17:13.490 --> 17:16.960
People sometimes think those
sort of things when they're angry.

17:16.970 --> 17:18.960
And then they usually do it. No, no.

17:18.970 --> 17:20.109
He's not gonna do it.

17:20.119 --> 17:21.670
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

17:21.680 --> 17:23.930
You are standing up now.

17:23.940 --> 17:25.560
No, I'm not.

17:25.569 --> 17:28.220
Yes, you are. No...

17:40.150 --> 17:41.860
You have to stop that!

17:41.870 --> 17:44.060
We dont know who's in these woods.

17:45.340 --> 17:46.540
Over there!

17:48.140 --> 17:49.280
This way!

17:49.800 --> 17:52.300
Don't count on them giving
you a nice room in a castle.

17:52.310 --> 17:54.210
If they think that you're
friends with the seeker,

17:54.210 --> 17:56.510
You're gonna die with the seeker.

17:56.780 --> 17:58.870
We have to run. No time for that.

17:59.080 --> 18:00.710
We're staying right here.

18:44.470 --> 18:46.530
You're coming with me, listener.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.380
Richard!

19:43.960 --> 19:47.780
The most anybody ever
paid for me was 20,000.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.610
I'm not worth getting killed over.

19:53.250 --> 19:54.880
Could you crush those up for me?

20:00.210 --> 20:02.000
Why are you doing this?

20:02.370 --> 20:04.280
Why did you save my life?

20:04.650 --> 20:07.880
Can't you just look in our
heads and see the answer to that?

20:07.900 --> 20:12.010
I see it. I just don't understand it.

20:12.370 --> 20:14.790
Why do you wanna destroy
darken rahl if you

20:14.800 --> 20:18.420
Aren't interested in
his throne or his gold.

20:19.220 --> 20:22.580
Why are you the only people
in the world who are like that?

20:22.640 --> 20:25.640
We're not. We're just
the first ones you've met.

20:33.980 --> 20:36.340
This place you're taking me to.

20:36.770 --> 20:38.630
What are the people there like?

20:40.580 --> 20:44.010
They're as good and kind
as anyone I've ever known.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.760
Then it's the wrong place for me.

20:48.130 --> 20:49.710
Why do you say that?

20:51.080 --> 20:52.670
Because I'm bad.

20:54.090 --> 20:56.700
No, you're not-- you don't
know anything about it.

20:57.200 --> 20:59.090
About the things I've done.

21:01.620 --> 21:04.360
When I was working for
the empress of threnegar,

21:04.370 --> 21:05.570
She wanted to know

21:05.570 --> 21:08.980
If there was anybody in her palace
who was plotting against her.

21:10.580 --> 21:13.520
I told her there were three people.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.870
The lord chamberlain,
the grand vizier and...

21:20.700 --> 21:22.330
...One of her sons.

21:23.280 --> 21:26.940
She put their heads on iron
stakes in front of the palace.

21:28.140 --> 21:30.240
That was not your fault. Yes, it was.

21:30.300 --> 21:32.330
And that was only one time.

21:32.730 --> 21:34.650
If you knew how many...

21:36.120 --> 21:37.980
Nobody gave you a choice.

21:38.910 --> 21:41.610
What happened to you was just as bad.

21:45.450 --> 21:46.650
What?

21:46.900 --> 21:48.150
What happened?

21:48.670 --> 21:49.880
Nothing.

21:50.500 --> 21:54.800
It's not nothing. Kahlan,
what happened to you?

21:57.660 --> 21:59.480
What I can do to people...

22:00.920 --> 22:02.790
Bring them under my control.

22:04.330 --> 22:06.710
My mother did that to my father

22:07.550 --> 22:08.710
Why?

22:11.750 --> 22:14.790
She-- she
had to.

22:18.310 --> 22:23.360
And when I was 5 years
old, and my sister was 3,

22:24.890 --> 22:31.490
My mom died, and my father
was freed from her hold on him

22:34.200 --> 22:36.060
So he came to get us.

22:37.010 --> 22:38.950
To claim what was his.

22:40.750 --> 22:47.040
He started making us use our powers
to get what he wanted out of people.

22:49.120 --> 22:55.830
We made them do such terrible things.

22:57.730 --> 23:03.930
And if we tried not to he would--
tie you up. Bind your hands.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.750
That's why you didn't want me...

23:11.500 --> 23:14.050
Why didn't you just use
your power against him?

23:19.290 --> 23:22.150
Because he was her father.

23:31.020 --> 23:35.100
When I was 11, another
confessor found us.

23:35.630 --> 23:39.080
She took us away from my father,
and brought us to thandor.

23:40.640 --> 23:44.350
The sisters of light became
more than parents to us.

23:46.530 --> 23:52.350
They didn't just save our lives,
they-- they gave us our lives.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.060
It's okay.

24:11.430 --> 24:17.940
It's just an owl complaining
about something, the way owls do.

24:19.330 --> 24:20.820
Does it still hurt?

24:22.160 --> 24:25.840
I would say no, but you'd I'd be lying.

24:27.610 --> 24:29.440
It's my fault you got hurt.

24:29.980 --> 24:32.690
Making you stop to pick blackberries.

24:32.740 --> 24:34.330
Screaming like that.

24:35.440 --> 24:36.930
Why don't you hate me?

24:36.940 --> 24:40.850
You should see more I put my
father through when I was your age.

24:45.300 --> 24:47.920
Why haven't you told her
what you feel about her?

24:52.250 --> 24:53.780
It's complicated.

24:55.820 --> 24:57.660
You'll understand when you get older.

24:58.530 --> 25:00.600
It's not that complicated.

25:00.980 --> 25:03.900
You're just scared she
doesn't feel the same way.

25:06.100 --> 25:07.950
But you don't have to be scared.

25:10.460 --> 25:12.750
She feels the same way you do.

25:18.080 --> 25:19.880
Why doesn't she say anything?

25:19.890 --> 25:21.010
I don't know.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.930
I mean, I know.

25:22.950 --> 25:25.470
It just doesn't make sense.

25:25.530 --> 25:29.980
Something about she's afraid
to hurt you with her powers.

25:36.230 --> 25:38.200
Why aren't you lying down?

25:40.620 --> 25:42.170
I'm not tired.

25:42.810 --> 25:45.030
You should be asleep too.

25:45.140 --> 25:46.430
I can't.

25:50.390 --> 25:53.190
Come on, renn. Give it a try.

25:53.370 --> 25:56.820
We have a long long walk tomorrow.

25:58.960 --> 26:02.830
* white glows the lily *

26:03.420 --> 26:07.250
* red glows the rose *

26:08.060 --> 26:11.610
* here lies my laddie *

26:12.000 --> 26:15.430
* look how he grows *

26:20.800 --> 26:22.310
Bear's been by here.

26:23.440 --> 26:24.760
Two of them, by the looks of it.

26:24.770 --> 26:26.600
See where they scratched
their backs on the tree?

26:26.820 --> 26:28.660
Do they come out during the day?

26:28.870 --> 26:30.380
Only to eat children.

26:34.670 --> 26:37.700
Why do we have to go
to this thandor place?

26:37.830 --> 26:40.950
I could just stay with you.

26:41.390 --> 26:44.010
You can't, renn. It's too dangerous.

26:44.370 --> 26:45.790
I'm not scared.

26:45.800 --> 26:48.300
Do you have any idea how
much I could help you?

26:48.310 --> 26:50.330
Yes, you could.

26:50.460 --> 26:52.910
But we can't get you any closer to rahl.

26:52.920 --> 26:54.200
Of course.

26:54.830 --> 27:00.030
Because then I might help him, and
that wouldn't be so good for you.

27:00.040 --> 27:02.270
That's only part of it. It's all right.

27:02.620 --> 27:04.120
I understand.

27:11.390 --> 27:14.670
* when shadows long o'er take the day *

27:14.680 --> 27:17.310
* and evil doth enslave us *

27:19.290 --> 27:23.140
* when war and strife
and fear hold sway *

27:23.140 --> 27:25.870
* the seeker then shall save us *

27:26.370 --> 27:28.490
I wonder how you'll sound
with your tongue cut out.

27:28.500 --> 27:30.080
* when cities burn and kingdoms fall *

27:30.090 --> 27:32.780
* the seeker then shall sound his call *

27:34.640 --> 27:38.240
* when men call darken rahl their lord *

27:38.990 --> 27:42.000
* the seeker then
shall raise his sword *

27:47.550 --> 27:53.640
Days are dark and hope is lost
and times grow ever weaker-- when

27:53.650 --> 27:56.130
Springtime dies
beneath the frost--

28:00.760 --> 28:05.110
Because then shall come
the seeker. Change of plan

28:06.400 --> 28:10.350
When I stand before darken rahl
tomorrow, I will tell him that I took it

28:10.360 --> 28:15.280
Upon myself to flay the traitor
alive, tied to a pole at the crossroad,

28:15.290 --> 28:19.360
Where all the passersby can watch
the crows feast on his eyeballs

28:19.360 --> 28:21.600
And learn from his example.

28:34.450 --> 28:37.340
And my last sight in this life will be a

28:37.350 --> 28:39.950
Treasonous wizard
gloating over my demise.

28:40.650 --> 28:42.590
What's your price? Huh?

28:43.190 --> 28:44.600
Gar got your tongue?

28:45.840 --> 28:48.830
Times are hard for all of us.

28:55.320 --> 28:58.780
Halt! In the name of
the council of obregon.

28:58.790 --> 28:59.930
Renn!

29:01.510 --> 29:02.820
Renn.

29:03.190 --> 29:04.410
Dad.

29:05.480 --> 29:07.780
I got word that you were
asking for me at the old house.

29:07.790 --> 29:09.580
I could hardly believe it.

29:09.590 --> 29:12.000
We rode the horses half
to death catching up.

29:12.210 --> 29:14.240
We know that you sold him.

29:14.250 --> 29:17.140
That was a rumor started
by the people who took him.

29:17.250 --> 29:18.640
It was a lie.

29:18.810 --> 29:21.570
There's a confessor here,
you're not taking the

29:21.580 --> 29:26.510
Boy anywhere until you
answer to her. Renn, tell them

29:26.610 --> 29:28.760
Look in my eyes and tell
them that I've been looking

29:28.770 --> 29:32.940
For you, every day, every
night, for five long years

29:40.300 --> 29:42.060
He's telling the truth.

29:45.050 --> 29:48.360
Whoever you are, thank you
for bringing my son to me.

29:48.480 --> 29:50.560
Your son is in great danger.

29:50.570 --> 29:52.530
He needs help with his gift.

29:52.640 --> 29:55.480
He should be brought to the sisters
of light until he's a little older.

29:55.490 --> 29:58.240
He's my father. I'm going with him.

29:59.580 --> 30:02.400
We should be going. We have
a long journey ahead of us.

30:18.230 --> 30:19.800
Thank you, councilor

30:30.130 --> 30:31.620
We should catch up with zedd.

30:43.700 --> 30:45.720
Prompt delivery of goods.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.850
That's the way darken
rahl likes to do business.

30:49.350 --> 30:52.000
Actually, you did me a favor.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.740
I was planning to work
for the d'harans anyway.

30:55.050 --> 30:56.720
So thanks, dad.

30:57.670 --> 30:59.960
I married your mother,
but I'm not your father.

31:00.840 --> 31:02.990
No son of mine would
be a freak like you.

31:05.580 --> 31:07.760
I would've sold you back to
those people you were with,

31:07.760 --> 31:13.020
But nowadays, nobody pays
better than darken rahl.

31:13.310 --> 31:15.900
He would've paid three
times more for me.

31:16.060 --> 31:18.090
You sold me too cheap.

31:22.310 --> 31:24.120
Specially outfitted for the listener.

31:24.750 --> 31:26.340
Is there anything I can get you?

31:29.400 --> 31:32.140
Pheasant with blackberry sauce.

31:32.150 --> 31:33.270
Get the boy what he wants.

31:33.270 --> 31:35.220
Then we race to the meeting point.

31:35.230 --> 31:37.040
Lord rahl is getting impatient.

31:39.630 --> 31:40.850
What are you thinking?

31:41.030 --> 31:43.030
If renn was here you
wouldn't have to ask.

31:43.990 --> 31:45.220
I don't have to ask.

31:45.230 --> 31:46.910
You're thinking what I'm thinking.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.600
We shouldn't have let renn go.

31:49.010 --> 31:50.320
He read his father's thoughts.

31:50.330 --> 31:52.440
If something was wrong he
wouldn't have gone with him.

31:52.450 --> 31:53.910
I'm not a listener or a confessor.

31:53.920 --> 31:55.510
I can't tell when people are lying,

31:55.520 --> 31:59.010
But something in my gut is telling
me that man was hiding something.

31:59.820 --> 32:05.060
Richard, are you sure this isn't
just because renn got into your heart?

32:06.020 --> 32:07.540
Like he got into mine?

32:08.580 --> 32:09.810
Maybe.

32:10.580 --> 32:13.550
But I can't let it go.

32:31.390 --> 32:32.860
Stop!

32:35.950 --> 32:37.250
Why?

32:37.630 --> 32:40.300
He's under a powerful enchantment.

32:40.730 --> 32:44.190
Whoever kills him will
come to terrible harm.

32:44.380 --> 32:45.990
Possibly death.

32:46.250 --> 32:48.880
Argoth will be honored
to take that risk.

32:50.900 --> 32:52.190
Proceed!

33:12.440 --> 33:14.820
Shoot it down! Kill it!

33:17.900 --> 33:19.280
You did that.

33:19.840 --> 33:21.220
Me?

33:21.850 --> 33:24.770
I told you he was under an enchantment.

33:24.860 --> 33:27.170
Astonishing magic and a
great wizard in the same

33:27.180 --> 33:30.790
Place at the same time.
Coincidence, do you think?

33:31.960 --> 33:35.190
But who am I to judge
the truth of such matters.

33:35.730 --> 33:38.060
We'll leave that to darken rahl.

33:38.390 --> 33:40.060
Bind his hands.

33:40.300 --> 33:42.270
He can't do magic without his hands.

33:54.990 --> 33:57.300
Where's renn? That's
no concern of yours.

33:57.310 --> 33:59.230
Tell me where he is. Unh!

34:11.380 --> 34:13.449
Did you sell him? To the d'harans?

34:13.460 --> 34:15.090
He was only my stepson.

34:15.100 --> 34:17.290
And that's an excuse? Don't.

34:17.300 --> 34:18.590
He's not worth it.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.690
Just take the money.
That's all he cares about.

34:22.659 --> 34:24.710
Which way did they go? South.

34:26.920 --> 34:28.420
If you ever show your
face to that boy again,

34:28.429 --> 34:30.610
I will roast you like a pig on a spit

34:34.389 --> 34:35.880
Richard, look!

34:40.929 --> 34:42.760
Zedd's headed the same way as renn.

34:56.949 --> 34:58.350
Welcome back, listener.

34:59.630 --> 35:01.600
Seems you've had quite an adventure.

35:01.860 --> 35:03.620
What do you need me to do?

35:04.170 --> 35:06.200
I need you to tell me who he is,

35:06.210 --> 35:10.590
What he wants, and most
importantly, who is he working with.

35:24.140 --> 35:25.910
You'd better tell the truth.

35:28.460 --> 35:31.460
Yes, he's a spy.

35:32.250 --> 35:33.940
I suspected as much.

35:34.870 --> 35:37.360
What he wants is to kill darken rahl.

35:37.790 --> 35:39.700
That I could have guessed.

35:44.070 --> 35:47.570
But what you couldn't have
guessed is who he's working with.

35:47.620 --> 35:50.170
And that would be...? Him.

35:50.180 --> 35:51.350
What?

35:51.360 --> 35:52.720
That's a lie.

35:52.730 --> 35:54.860
I swear, I've never
seen the wizard before.

35:54.870 --> 35:57.300
Do you also swear that
you don't have a flask

35:57.310 --> 35:59.410
Of spirits tucked into
your left boot, either?

35:59.420 --> 36:00.620
Spirits?

36:00.630 --> 36:02.550
On duty? All right.

36:02.560 --> 36:03.590
Give me my 10 lashes,

36:03.600 --> 36:07.150
But I swear to you on my
mother, I've never met the wizard

36:07.160 --> 36:08.770
He didn't need to meet him.

36:08.930 --> 36:11.820
It was all organized by him.

36:18.730 --> 36:21.230
Calgor has been my
friend since childhood.

36:22.300 --> 36:24.450
I know him and trust him like a brother.

36:24.460 --> 36:28.230
Well, ask your friend what
he was doing with your wife

36:28.230 --> 36:31.010
While you were on maneuvers last month.

36:34.840 --> 36:36.610
That won't do you any good.

36:36.940 --> 36:41.670
Unless you do the same
to him, and him, and him.

36:41.680 --> 36:43.730
They're all in on the wizard's plot.

36:45.110 --> 36:46.730
Arrest them all!

36:50.570 --> 36:54.190
If you could free two
fingers, I'd be able to...

37:00.520 --> 37:01.900
Hurry, renn!

37:02.240 --> 37:03.490
Look out!

37:03.680 --> 37:05.190
Renn!

37:57.370 --> 37:58.430
Renn.

37:58.570 --> 38:02.490
If you saw what your father was
thinking, why did you go with him?

38:02.500 --> 38:05.720
I saw that he was going to
kill you both if I didn't.

38:06.260 --> 38:09.140
I saw that he had more men on their way.

38:09.610 --> 38:11.320
Men with big knives.

38:16.540 --> 38:19.100
And then I saw that
you were their friend.

38:32.130 --> 38:33.750
And whose tracks are those?

38:38.180 --> 38:39.360
Fox.

38:39.390 --> 38:41.930
Silver, by the size of the prints.

38:41.940 --> 38:44.460
Excellent! Okay, enough
tracking for today.

38:44.470 --> 38:45.840
Time for history.

38:46.070 --> 38:51.590
Tell me the first wizards of
aydindril, starting with elenath.

38:51.600 --> 38:53.930
Oh, leave him be.

38:53.940 --> 38:57.130
Give the boy too many lessons, and
he won't have time to learn anything.

38:57.140 --> 39:00.070
As if you ever let up
on me for one second.

39:08.990 --> 39:10.210
We're here.

39:10.770 --> 39:11.990
We're where?

39:14.290 --> 39:15.570
Thandor.

39:19.320 --> 39:20.520
Wildranath.

39:20.530 --> 39:21.970
Galadrahn.

40:00.490 --> 40:02.050
Welcome, renn.

40:02.070 --> 40:04.330
We've all been looking
forward to meeting you.

40:04.340 --> 40:06.290
How did
you--? Henry.

40:06.300 --> 40:10.080
Henry always knows what's
coming, long before it gets here.

40:16.250 --> 40:18.070
We have to say goodbye now.

40:18.430 --> 40:19.990
I don't want to.

40:21.550 --> 40:23.470
I wanna stay with you.

40:23.480 --> 40:24.940
We'll come back.

40:25.040 --> 40:26.990
When the midlands are free.

40:33.360 --> 40:35.390
Tell him what you feel about him.

40:36.500 --> 40:37.750
It'll be okay.

40:43.330 --> 40:45.310
I'm sorry I kicked
you where I kicked you.

40:46.170 --> 40:47.730
It's closing now.

40:49.560 --> 40:53.060
Remember, moss grows on
the north side of the tree,

40:53.100 --> 40:56.040
And cows lie down when
it's going to rain,

40:56.460 --> 41:01.190
And you're gonna be all
right no matter what.

41:05.580 --> 41:07.020
Go.

41:21.110 --> 41:22.480
Well, if we ever get to be parents,

41:22.490 --> 41:24.390
I guess we will have had some practice.

41:34.470 --> 41:36.560
Hey, you!

41:36.830 --> 41:38.160
Get away.

41:38.500 --> 41:40.720
That's how you treat a friend of mine?

41:47.840 --> 41:49.300
Thank you, wizard.

41:49.620 --> 41:50.830
I'm sorry I doubted you.

41:50.840 --> 41:53.000
You had every reason to.

41:53.180 --> 41:56.660
I hope you enjoyed your moment of
flight, because you won't have another.

41:56.670 --> 41:59.410
That's a spell that only
works one time in a thousand.

41:59.420 --> 42:00.860
You were lucky.

42:03.680 --> 42:05.310
Long life to the seeker.

42:05.690 --> 42:07.620
Long life to you, sir.

42:07.630 --> 42:09.370
I will join you in
your fight against rahl,

42:09.370 --> 42:11.600
Wherever I am, however I can.

42:11.770 --> 42:14.590
But right now I must make
sure my family is safe.

42:14.600 --> 42:17.510
What I can give you right now
is something I heard at the fort.

42:17.670 --> 42:20.000
Darken rahl just sent 200 men to a city

42:20.000 --> 42:23.260
Called kelabra, on a
mission of great importance.

42:27.360 --> 42:28.820
To kelabra, then.

42:28.830 --> 42:31.690
There's just one problem.

42:32.430 --> 42:37.790
Kelabra was destroyed in the
eruption of mt.Mariah 2000 years ago,

42:37.790 --> 42:41.300
And buried under
millions of tons of rock.
