00:11.166 --> 00:14.066
Though, pirates have beards and so
does Santa, so I'm sticking with it.

-Weird kid.
-You got that right, Santa.

00:24.166 --> 00:26.333
So, how are we rating
this year's Santa?

00:26.600 --> 00:29.800
Well, off the beaten path,

00:30.367 --> 00:31.533
Good attitude, though.

was in a motorcycle gang.

00:40.467 --> 00:42.433

a siren hat and a toy bugle.

00:50.667 --> 00:51.834

Besides, he didn't say anything
when I took them.

when I took it, but still.

He weighs a lot less.

01:00.800 --> 01:03.300
Yeah, but I need him
to help me make some papier-mâché

01:03.433 --> 01:04.767

01:05.033 --> 01:07.367
Plus, he's good at getting
sticky stuff everywhere,

01:07.433 --> 01:08.934
so this time it'll be useful.

the tree on the float, right?

cheery music of a yuletide nature.

how's the float coming along?

It's good. It's gonna take us
all day to finish,

11:16.767 --> 11:18.000
but I think we can do it.

11:18.133 --> 11:19.367
Did you guys finish the plumbing?

11:19.500 --> 11:22.100
Uh, not exactly. It's taking
a little longer than we hoped.

11:25.300 --> 11:27.633
I just came by to pick up
some hacksaw blades from my toolbox.

11:27.767 --> 11:29.033
You guys think you'll finish in time?

11:29.233 --> 11:31.734
I don't know. I don't really think
we have enough help.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.567
What I'm afraid of
is that Nobby and his friends

11:33.734 --> 11:35.367
won't have any place
to stay for Christmas.

11:35.800 --> 11:37.333
Well, is there
anything I can do to help?

11:37.633 --> 11:39.467
Sure. We could always use
an extra pair of hands.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.800
-Cool.
-But what about my float, Gordo?

11:42.100 --> 11:43.934
I'm sorry, Lizzie. It's just...

11:44.533 --> 11:47.600
Well, I think fixing plumbing
is a little more important.

11:49.233 --> 11:50.533

11:50.667 --> 11:53.500

we'll come back and help you out.

I wanted to be a dentist,
so I could help people.

'Cause helping people
is what it's all about.

13:26.433 --> 13:28.367
Well, I wish someone
would help me finish my float.

13:28.734 --> 13:31.700
Why are you so obsessed
with this float, Lizzie McGuire?

13:32.433 --> 13:33.500
Why?

13:35.266 --> 13:39.600
Here, with the answer to that,
is the Ghost of Christmas Past.

13:41.367 --> 13:43.300
Okay, this is crazy.

13:43.433 --> 13:45.533
Junk food must be giving me
a bad dream or something.

13:46.166 --> 13:48.300
Mom, you're not
the Ghost of Christmas Past.

13:48.667 --> 13:50.600
You're the pepperoni pizza
that I ate for dinner.

13:50.800 --> 13:53.200
Lizzie, could pepperoni do this?

13:57.100 --> 13:59.033
Okay. What do you want
to show me, spirit?

13:59.433 --> 14:02.000
Look, Lizzie. Look at the TV box.

14:04.967 --> 14:07.633
That's my bedroom.
Why are you showing me my room?

14:07.700 --> 14:08.967
Because it's a mess.

14:09.033 --> 14:11.100
Would it kill you
to clean it up once in a while?

14:11.934 --> 14:14.567
Even though my mom
is the Ghost of Christmas Past,

14:14.633 --> 14:15.767
she has to hassle me.

14:16.066 --> 14:19.400
The point is, instead of enjoying
Christmas with the rest of us,

14:19.467 --> 14:21.100
you're obsessed with winning.

14:22.300 --> 14:26.033
Okay, so maybe Christmas
isn't about my float,

14:26.166 --> 14:28.333
but now I'm getting a little confused.

14:28.500 --> 14:29.500
What is it about?

14:29.567 --> 14:32.066
I'll tell you what Christmas
is really about, Lizzie McGuire.

14:32.567 --> 14:33.667
Lights, please.

14:35.533 --> 14:39.533
Near Bethlehem, there were shepherds
watching over their flocks by night.

14:39.867 --> 14:42.400
Then the angel of the Lord
appeared before them.

14:42.533 --> 14:46.767
"Fear not," said the angel,
for I bring you tidings of great joy.

14:46.900 --> 14:49.967
"For unto you is born this day
in the city of David,

14:50.100 --> 14:52.533
"a child who shall be your savior."

14:52.867 --> 14:55.200
And suddenly, the angel was surrounded

14:55.266 --> 14:58.033
by a great multitude
of the heavenly hosts,

14:58.934 --> 15:01.700
singing, "Glory to God in the highest,

15:01.834 --> 15:04.734
"and on Earth,
peace and goodwill towards men.'"

15:05.166 --> 15:07.734
And that's the real meaning
of Christmas, Lizzie McGuire.

15:12.300 --> 15:15.066
You know,
I do a really great wise man.

15:15.934 --> 15:17.300
Hey, hey, hey.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.800
I shouldn't care about
winning something for myself.

15:20.934 --> 15:22.767
Christmas is about
doing good for others,

15:22.834 --> 15:24.500
just like you guys
fixing the plumbing.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.900
By the way, I hope that's going okay.

15:27.033 --> 15:28.734
I can show you how it's going.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.934
They're dirty and grimy.
Their hands must be stinging.

15:37.200 --> 15:40.066
But yet they keep plumbing.
They're plumbing and singing.

15:40.266 --> 15:43.233
But how can they plumb,
when they plumb without tools?

15:43.367 --> 15:46.000
They plumb without skipples,
dee-daddles or zools.

15:47.834 --> 15:48.867
[SIGHS]

15:49.000 --> 15:51.200
No wonder they make
no plumb progress at all,

15:51.467 --> 15:54.900
because the pipes that they're
plumbing are two sizes too small.

15:56.734 --> 16:00.166
I could still help them,
and we could get finished in time.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.100
I just have to get over there.

16:02.266 --> 16:06.266
Lizzie, you've had the power
to go there all along.

16:06.533 --> 16:10.300
I know. I just close my eyes
and click my heels three times.

16:10.433 --> 16:12.166
Why would you do that?

16:12.300 --> 16:15.600
I've got my
Olds Delta '88 parked outside.

16:15.667 --> 16:16.867
I'll give you a lift.

16:19.166 --> 16:21.033

16:22.333 --> 16:24.767
I've got to get over there.
I hope I'm not too late.

16:30.367 --> 16:32.934
It is no use.
There's just no way it's gonna fit.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.200
There's no way
we're gonna get this done on time.

16:35.333 --> 16:38.467
Now the old folks won't have anywhere
to spend Christmas. Bummer.

16:38.700 --> 16:41.200
Can't they stay with us?
I can share my room.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.266
Oh, honey, there are 240 of them.

-They can share Lizzie's room, too.
-SAM: Matt.

16:45.934 --> 16:48.900
Um, no, I don't think so.
I'm not sharing my room.

16:51.100 --> 16:52.934
Because we're gonna get this
finished tonight.

16:53.533 --> 16:55.200

It won't get done in time.

16:55.266 --> 16:56.300
Yeah.

16:56.367 --> 16:59.166
I know, but I shouldn't care about
my float winning first prize.

16:59.567 --> 17:01.734
What matters is finding pipes
the right size.

17:03.700 --> 17:05.900
Okay, we need to change out
the main lines

17:05.967 --> 17:07.333
and use step-down couplings.

17:08.533 --> 17:11.433
Wow! How did you think of that,
Lizzie? That could work.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.467
I don't know.
It just kind of came to me.

17:13.967 --> 17:17.367
However it came to you, young lady,
you have just saved the day.

17:17.700 --> 17:19.200
Well, that's what Christmas is about.

17:19.633 --> 17:23.734
It shouldn't be about my float
having reindeer or candy canes on it.
