00:09.958 --> 00:15.541
Everybody knows the first step in making
any football team is the tryout.

00:16.208 --> 00:20.041
And to make it to the pros,
the tryout starts with the combine.

00:27.375 --> 00:33.333
Potential players are paraded out
in front of scouts, coaches, and owners,

00:33.916 --> 00:37.250
who measure their physical talent
and on-field abilities.

00:38.041 --> 00:43.333
Coaches will tell you they're looking
for warriors, killers, beasts.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.458
They say they want you to be an animal.

00:50.375 --> 00:51.708
And you wanna give them that.

01:10.916 --> 01:12.583
But let me tell you.

01:12.666 --> 01:18.333
What they don't want you to understand,
is what's established is a power dynamic.

01:25.333 --> 01:31.083
Before they put you on the field,
teams poke, prod, and examine you.

01:31.625 --> 01:35.541
Searching for any defect
that might affect your performance.

01:35.625 --> 01:40.041
No boundary respected.
No dignity left intact.

01:50.041 --> 01:52.875
Come on, boy. Hurry up.
Look at that shape there.

01:53.375 --> 01:54.208
Look at this.

01:55.625 --> 01:58.916
Mr. Farmer, got your bid.
Thirty, James. Thirty to you.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.125
One hundred! Sold!

02:00.208 --> 02:02.958
Next one coming up, best one we got.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.333
-Five hundred.
-Five hundred!

02:06.708 --> 02:08.958
-Six hundred!
-Right here.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.083
Look at this here!

02:12.166 --> 02:13.750
Come on! Who wants this?

02:15.375 --> 02:16.875
-Seven hundred!
-Seven!

02:16.958 --> 02:19.750
-There we go. One thousand!
-One thousand!

02:20.208 --> 02:21.500
I'm telling you what I want.

02:21.583 --> 02:23.500
-Yeah, I heard ya.
-Sold!

02:36.208 --> 02:40.291
As a kid, you're not thinking
that you're being groomed for a system.

02:41.125 --> 02:45.083
You just love playing football.
You're just trying to make the team.

02:49.166 --> 02:53.250
Back then, all I cared about
was football, baseball,

02:53.333 --> 02:55.708
and a little bit of hoopin' on the side.

03:02.666 --> 03:04.625
-Nice.
-Damn!

03:04.708 --> 03:06.583
Check the hands on Kaepernick.

03:06.666 --> 03:09.416
I tell you what, this kid gets
better and better every year.

03:23.000 --> 03:23.833
Okay.

03:23.916 --> 03:26.875
Maybe a little part of me
wanted to be cool too.

03:29.083 --> 03:30.750
Hey, did you see Baby Boy?

03:30.833 --> 03:32.291
What? The movie?

03:32.375 --> 03:35.125
Nah, fool. Like the toddler.
Yes, the movie.

03:35.708 --> 03:37.041
-No.
-Look.

03:37.125 --> 03:40.458
I snatched it off LimeWire.
You know it's rated R, right?

03:41.250 --> 03:43.375
Your mom let you see it?
She's strict as shit.

03:43.458 --> 03:44.833
She's not that strict.

03:45.500 --> 03:48.041
-All right. Yeah, I'll burn you a copy.
-Fact.

03:48.125 --> 03:49.958
Okay, then, Lori. I see you.

03:51.291 --> 03:55.125
Hey, I might holla at Lori.
She all right for an eighth-grader.

03:55.208 --> 03:58.125
-We're eighth-graders.
-But I'm mature for my age.

03:58.208 --> 03:59.416
-Oh!
-Mm.

04:00.375 --> 04:02.583
Well, look. Go ahead. Ask.

04:03.583 --> 04:04.833
Ask what?

04:04.916 --> 04:06.708
-Ask, Colin.
-Ask what, Ryan?

04:06.791 --> 04:09.750
You wanna know about the hair, right?
Dope, ain't it?

04:10.500 --> 04:12.500
-Yeah.
-Bro. Look at the back, bro.

04:12.583 --> 04:13.666
My shit got hang.

04:15.083 --> 04:18.333
Look. This high school girl hooked me up,
Dee Dee.

04:18.916 --> 04:21.458
She can probably do something
with yours too.

04:22.250 --> 04:25.041
Okay. All right. Catch you after practice.

04:26.041 --> 04:27.250
-See you.
-All right.

04:29.916 --> 04:32.666
-Hello!
-Hi, is this Dee Dee?

04:32.750 --> 04:34.416
No, this is her mother.
Who is this?

04:34.500 --> 04:36.708
Oh, um, I'm Colin.

04:36.791 --> 04:40.625
I'm calling about getting my hair braided.
Ryan said it was cool.

04:40.708 --> 04:42.916
Oh. Hold on. Dee Dee!

04:49.583 --> 04:51.208
I was born in Wisconsin.

04:51.625 --> 04:55.541
A place known for dairy farming
and a scarcity of Black people.

04:55.625 --> 04:57.833
But I grew up in Turlock, California.

04:57.916 --> 05:00.125
A place also known for dairy farming,

05:00.208 --> 05:02.958
and you guessed it,
a scarcity of Black people.

05:03.541 --> 05:05.916
One place that you could
see Black people in Turlock

05:06.000 --> 05:08.125
was Dee Dee's apartment complex.

05:08.208 --> 05:12.000
Even though it was just a few blocks
from my house, I had never been there,

05:12.583 --> 05:14.333
but I could see myself there.

05:16.458 --> 05:17.291
Colin?

05:18.125 --> 05:19.500
Yeah. Dee Dee?

05:20.166 --> 05:21.250
Mm-hm.

05:29.125 --> 05:29.958
Okay.

05:30.625 --> 05:31.458
A challenge.

05:32.250 --> 05:33.083
Come on.

05:41.000 --> 05:41.958
Are you okay?

05:42.041 --> 05:43.208
Am I okay?

05:43.708 --> 05:47.166
I felt like my hair was playing tug-o-war
with my scalp.

05:47.250 --> 05:51.041
And the rope they were using was on fire.
Am I okay?

05:52.708 --> 05:53.583
Uh-huh.

05:54.375 --> 05:55.208
Okay.

05:56.500 --> 05:59.291
-Why don't you two get a room?
-Boy, keep quiet.

05:59.375 --> 06:02.416
You keep clownin' around, Mom will
make you wear that nose forever.

06:04.250 --> 06:07.500
Mama, can you get me some hair grease
out the bathroom, please?

06:07.583 --> 06:10.708
We don't have any more.
And I told you you were gonna run out.

06:10.791 --> 06:12.500
But I need some to finish his hair.

06:12.583 --> 06:15.458
You can run and get some.
Or I can pick you up some from the mall.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.500
-What mall you going to?
-Modesto.

06:17.583 --> 06:19.208
That'll take too long.

06:19.791 --> 06:23.000
You know what? There is this cute top
I've been wanting to try on.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.375
I'll come with you.

06:26.416 --> 06:27.791
Come with me! Come on.

06:29.208 --> 06:30.041
You too.

06:32.625 --> 06:33.458
Come on.

06:42.833 --> 06:44.750
We're gonna be about 20 minutes.

06:45.333 --> 06:46.166
Be good.

06:51.041 --> 06:52.416
Don't get out this car.

07:04.416 --> 07:05.708
What's your name, little dude?

07:09.333 --> 07:11.375
You look ridiculous.

07:11.458 --> 07:13.416
-So do you.
-What?

07:13.500 --> 07:14.333
Nothing.

07:15.625 --> 07:18.750
I was in a hot car
with an angry clown,

07:18.833 --> 07:20.333
waiting for more torture.

07:21.125 --> 07:24.375
-I just hoped it would be worth it.
-Okay. And boom!

07:26.500 --> 07:29.166
Well, what do you think? Say something.

07:29.791 --> 07:31.708
Is it supposed to be this tight?

07:33.458 --> 07:35.500
I had to do it because of your texture.

07:35.583 --> 07:39.666
Biracial hair is so hard to work with.
It slips and slides all over the place.

07:40.291 --> 07:42.125
But I made it work, though.

07:42.708 --> 07:45.875
You know who you look like? Allen Iverson.

07:46.458 --> 07:48.708
You look good. I did a good job.

07:51.833 --> 07:54.125
Sorry it took so long.
Are you good getting home?

07:54.208 --> 07:55.208
Oh, um...

07:56.583 --> 07:57.833
Can I use your phone?

07:58.541 --> 07:59.375
Bye.

07:59.458 --> 08:02.333
The next 24 hours
were like a roller coaster.

08:03.791 --> 08:05.250
I thought I looked good.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.125
But my head was on fire.

08:09.416 --> 08:13.375
-My mom was salty for some reason.
-We didn't know where you were.

08:14.791 --> 08:15.625
Huh?

08:15.708 --> 08:18.708
I said we didn't know where you were,
me and your dad.

08:18.791 --> 08:20.625
I left a note on the fridge.

08:21.166 --> 08:22.000
I saw it.

08:23.666 --> 08:26.208
Didn't say where you were. Colin.

08:26.916 --> 08:30.250
And let's just say salt and fire
are not a good mix.

08:32.583 --> 08:34.708
Between my mom's non-reaction
one minute...

08:34.791 --> 08:38.208
I just met her today.
She's a friend of a friend.

08:38.291 --> 08:39.916
...or subtle criticism the next...

08:40.000 --> 08:43.375
Your gym teacher
is your basketball coach, right?

08:43.458 --> 08:44.291
Yeah.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.500
Think he'll like your hair like that?

08:50.083 --> 08:53.000
...and the throbbing pain I felt
all that night...

08:57.458 --> 08:58.583
I got this.

08:58.666 --> 09:00.958
...I still hoped it'd all be worth it.

09:04.708 --> 09:06.708
They said he looks unprofessional.

09:08.083 --> 09:08.916
Intimidating.

09:10.041 --> 09:14.250
-Messy. He's clearly unfocused.
-What are we talking about?

09:14.833 --> 09:16.125
He's dangerous.

09:16.208 --> 09:17.958
He's damaging to the league.

09:18.041 --> 09:19.666
He's disrespectful.

09:19.750 --> 09:23.500
In 1997, right after taking
the league by storm

09:23.583 --> 09:25.000
and winning Rookie of the Year...

09:25.083 --> 09:27.375
The crowd is into it.
Allen shakes free.

09:27.458 --> 09:28.875
Gets two!

09:31.208 --> 09:34.958
A young NBA superstar
heard more criticism than kudos.

09:35.041 --> 09:36.791
-That's the body language of a--
-Thug!

09:36.875 --> 09:40.875
He experienced more
political policing than passionate praise.

09:41.500 --> 09:42.416
Why?

09:42.500 --> 09:44.333
Why did this exceptional player

09:44.416 --> 09:48.125
with an uncanny combination
of grace and grit

09:48.208 --> 09:50.625
cause such ire from the powers that were?

09:51.333 --> 09:54.583
Well, what he did to start
this controversy was simple, deliberate,

09:54.666 --> 09:56.291
and true to himself.

09:56.375 --> 09:57.791
He embraced his culture.

09:58.375 --> 09:59.583
He braided his hair.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.458
You know him as AI,
the Answer, Allen Iverson.

10:09.541 --> 10:14.416
Number 3, Allen Iverson!

10:19.916 --> 10:24.250
One of the most dynamic players
to ever grace the basketball court.

10:24.333 --> 10:29.208
He endured scorn and derision
over this simple act of self-expression.

10:30.250 --> 10:33.375
It's easy to see how crazy that is today.

10:34.583 --> 10:35.666
But at the time...

10:37.458 --> 10:39.500
I had no idea how he felt.

10:43.458 --> 10:46.250
Even though I felt like I could
fall asleep standing up,

10:46.333 --> 10:49.666
I couldn't wait to get to school
to show off my new swag.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.416
-That's a new outfit.
-Yep.

10:52.458 --> 10:55.625
-Um, you want me to toast it for you?
-No thanks.

10:56.333 --> 10:58.291
-Who eats a raw Pop Tart?

10:59.750 --> 11:01.583
Allen Iverson, maybe.

11:03.958 --> 11:05.625
Yo, you went to see Dee Dee?

11:05.708 --> 11:09.625
And you got the fresh AIs on too.
Out here looking like The Answer for real.

11:09.708 --> 11:12.041
I'm surprised your mom let you out
without khakis.

11:12.125 --> 11:14.166
Oh. Okay. Yeah, you got jokes now.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.375
-But for real, though. You like it?
-Yeah.

11:18.458 --> 11:20.666
-Good looking out, man.
-I heard you got that hair--

11:20.750 --> 11:21.875
Oh.

11:21.958 --> 11:22.791
My bad.

11:22.875 --> 11:25.250
Yo, mine hurt at first too, bro.
You gotta get used to it.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.666
It's not that bad.

11:33.750 --> 11:34.583
You suck.

11:35.208 --> 11:36.416
Did he just airball?

11:39.625 --> 11:42.291
Colin. Colin, the coach
wants to talk to you.

11:46.791 --> 11:48.166
Today!

11:50.541 --> 11:51.375
Two more!

11:51.458 --> 11:54.458
What? Come on. What's going on, bud?

11:54.541 --> 11:56.083
Nothing. I'm good.

11:56.166 --> 11:59.125
I just have a little headache,
and I'm tired, but I'm good.

12:00.541 --> 12:02.541
Run a couple of laps.
See if that wakes you up.

12:04.958 --> 12:08.708
You want me to run? Even though I'm tired
and I have a headache?

12:08.791 --> 12:11.083
I want you to run
so you know you can do it,

12:11.166 --> 12:13.791
even when you are tired
and have a headache.

12:28.666 --> 12:29.875
These are too tight.

12:41.041 --> 12:42.041
This isn't right.

13:08.375 --> 13:11.041
Mm. It's seasoned already, honey.

13:12.791 --> 13:13.833
Mm-hm.

13:13.916 --> 13:15.083
Okay.

13:16.000 --> 13:16.833
Mm.

13:17.625 --> 13:18.458
Tasty.

13:27.375 --> 13:30.833
Colin, you ever hear of a thing
called decision fatigue?

13:32.416 --> 13:33.250
What's that?

13:35.333 --> 13:37.708
Well, the brain is like a muscle, right?

13:38.791 --> 13:41.708
The more you use a muscle,
the more tired it gets.

13:44.500 --> 13:45.333
Okay.

13:46.250 --> 13:51.791
Well, I think you're wasting
your brain energy on hairstyles.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.250
-My brain energy?
-Yeah.

13:56.333 --> 13:57.625
Mm.

13:57.708 --> 14:01.166
You don't wanna get decision fatigue
because you're thinking about your hair,

14:01.250 --> 14:03.291
or what to wear, or anything like that.

14:03.375 --> 14:06.666
You need your brain to focus
on more important things.

14:07.333 --> 14:09.166
I don't have decision fatigue.

14:09.250 --> 14:10.458
Mm...

14:12.458 --> 14:16.458
From now on, we want you
to get your hair done by professionals.

14:16.541 --> 14:20.083
No more of this going rogue business.
You don't just go to someone's house.

14:20.166 --> 14:22.000
They probably don't even have a license.

14:22.083 --> 14:25.500
Let me add, I think we should
just get your hair cut low.

14:25.583 --> 14:27.416
You won't have to think about it.

14:27.500 --> 14:31.791
I mean, one of the reasons Michael Jordan
accomplished so much is because he's bald.

14:31.875 --> 14:32.958
Mm.

14:33.041 --> 14:35.625
I bet you could get to SuperCuts
tonight if you hurry.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.791
That's a terrific idea.

14:37.875 --> 14:38.791
SuperCuts.

14:38.875 --> 14:40.916
He has a million things
to worry about.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.666
-Hair doesn't have to be one of them.
-So, it's settled.

14:44.375 --> 14:45.500
I'll take him after dinner.

15:09.708 --> 15:13.041
You already know what it is.
They want war, so they invade Afghanistan.

15:13.125 --> 15:15.625
They wanna spy on us,
so they give us the Patriot Act.

15:15.708 --> 15:17.625
They wanna control
who gets to be American,

15:17.708 --> 15:19.375
so they create Homeland Security.

15:19.458 --> 15:21.041
-I know that's right.
-Hey, Shawn.

15:21.583 --> 15:22.458
Hey.

15:23.791 --> 15:24.666
Patrice.

15:24.750 --> 15:25.583
Hey.

15:32.791 --> 15:35.208
-What's going on with you?
-Not too much.

15:35.291 --> 15:36.208
Um...

15:37.166 --> 15:38.000
A question.

15:39.958 --> 15:45.333
You know that hairstyle that, uh,
Black people like? It looks like ropes?

15:45.416 --> 15:48.333
And they hang off the back of your head.

15:48.875 --> 15:49.708
You know?

15:50.208 --> 15:51.958
You know? What's that singer? Um...

15:52.666 --> 15:53.500
You know, uh...

16:00.416 --> 16:03.500
Um, you like basketball, right?

16:04.541 --> 16:05.791
Uh...

16:05.875 --> 16:07.041
Do you know, um...

16:08.916 --> 16:11.541
where I can get my son's hair
done like this?

16:14.041 --> 16:15.166
Cornrows.

16:17.333 --> 16:20.041
-That's what they're called.
-That's what they're called.

16:22.541 --> 16:26.791
Can you help me out? I'm sorry.
I don't know what I'm doing.

16:28.000 --> 16:28.833
Yeah.

16:30.916 --> 16:32.416
I can help you with that.

16:43.250 --> 16:46.750
Oh, but I thought you said
we were going to a barber shop?

16:46.833 --> 16:47.666
Yeah. Come on.

17:00.333 --> 17:01.708
Whoa.

17:16.583 --> 17:21.666
All right. I know I look amazed,
but you have to understand something.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.625
I'd never been anywhere like this before.

17:24.708 --> 17:26.583
It felt like... me.

17:29.125 --> 17:32.416
Let me share a story with you
that's not told enough.

17:32.500 --> 17:37.166
During a hot summer in the Bronx,
back in 1973,

17:37.250 --> 17:42.625
a young teenage immigrant from Jamaica
was discovering his love of music.

17:51.083 --> 17:53.291
-Don't you have homework to do?
-Huh?

17:53.375 --> 17:56.500
-Homework, Clive.
-Hold on, Pop. The break about to drop.

18:02.916 --> 18:05.666
It's cool.
The breakbeat's too short anyway.

18:05.750 --> 18:08.833
Every party I throw,
people go crazy over the breaks.

18:08.916 --> 18:10.708
How was school, Clive?

18:11.375 --> 18:14.875
School is school, Pops. It's boring
since they canceled the music program.

18:14.958 --> 18:16.291
You get enough music at home.

18:16.375 --> 18:19.625
Right now, there's nothing more important
than your education.

18:19.708 --> 18:22.000
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

18:24.625 --> 18:25.708
Here.

18:27.916 --> 18:32.500
You play it so much,
I figure you need a backup.

18:35.750 --> 18:37.000
Do your homework.

18:37.875 --> 18:39.083
I'll see you later.

18:40.416 --> 18:41.333
Right.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.666
This young man's name
was Clive Campbell,

19:27.750 --> 19:33.291
but he would soon become
the legendary DJ Kool Herc.

19:33.375 --> 19:36.000
As obvious as it may seem today,

19:36.083 --> 19:41.083
it was the first time anyone had mixed
the breakbeat of the same song.

19:41.166 --> 19:46.625
Herc called it The Merry-Go-Round,
and everybody loved it.

19:46.708 --> 19:51.291
In fact, they loved it so much,
it became a movement.

20:02.916 --> 20:05.958
From the music, came the dancing.

20:07.166 --> 20:09.166
And the clothes.

20:10.458 --> 20:14.041
And the hair. And the art.

20:14.625 --> 20:16.833
But not everybody embraced the vibe.

20:17.583 --> 20:21.458
In 2005, the NBA implemented a dress code.

20:22.208 --> 20:25.333
Because one man was helping bring it
to the masses.

20:26.250 --> 20:29.125
I don't have to tell you
who that one man was, do I?

20:29.208 --> 20:31.875
I don't wanna be Michael Jordan.
I don't wanna be Magic.

20:31.958 --> 20:35.333
I don't wanna be Bird or Isaiah.
I don't wanna be any of those guys.

20:35.416 --> 20:36.500
When my career is over,

20:36.583 --> 20:39.166
I'm gonna look in the mirror and say,
"I did it my way."

20:41.291 --> 20:44.583
Hip-hop was conceived and raised
by rebels.

20:44.666 --> 20:46.875
Who wouldn't wanna be a part of that?

20:52.250 --> 20:54.708
Well, now, this can't be the right place.

20:56.083 --> 20:58.958
Hi. Hi. Hi.

20:59.041 --> 21:01.583
Um, is there a barber shop nearby?

21:01.666 --> 21:03.916
'Cause this is the address
that I was given.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.583
Shop's in the back.

21:12.375 --> 21:15.875
I didn't even tell you. I tried to get
a fade at one of them franchise spots?

21:15.958 --> 21:17.458
-What?
-You mean a white shop?

21:18.416 --> 21:22.041
-Come on, man. You tried to cheat on me?
-I was in a hurry, and I needed a cut.

21:22.125 --> 21:24.916
Wow. You know I'm the only person
for the job. Come on, now.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.416
Ooh, I know.

21:27.291 --> 21:29.208
Yeah. This looks good.

21:29.291 --> 21:30.791
Hey, man. Who next?

21:30.875 --> 21:31.958
Here you go.

21:34.708 --> 21:37.041
-All right. See y'all next week.
-All right. Peace, Reggie.

21:40.875 --> 21:43.083
-You must be Colin.
-Yeah.

21:43.166 --> 21:45.541
-Hi.
-And your mom?

21:45.625 --> 21:47.500
-Yeah.
-You called me, right?

21:47.583 --> 21:49.250
You want me to bless shorty
like the boy AI?

21:49.333 --> 21:54.250
Oh. No, he-- He wants braids,
like Allen Iverson.

21:54.333 --> 21:55.833
That's what I said.

21:58.541 --> 22:00.041
Come on, Colin. Let's get it.

22:00.791 --> 22:02.583
Really? Braids?

22:03.416 --> 22:04.291
Go on.

22:08.041 --> 22:10.125
You can relax, Mom.
It's gonna be a minute.

22:11.375 --> 22:12.208
Okay.

22:16.916 --> 22:18.291
All right, you ready?

22:21.333 --> 22:22.291
Well?

22:24.166 --> 22:25.291
I like it.

22:25.375 --> 22:27.166
Oh, that's it? You like it?

22:27.250 --> 22:29.333
-You don't love it?
-I love it.

22:29.416 --> 22:31.583
Yeah. That's better.

22:31.666 --> 22:33.500
You know how to take care of it?

22:33.583 --> 22:34.541
No.

22:35.125 --> 22:37.541
All right. Come on.
Let's go get you some products.

22:40.833 --> 22:42.166
You all right, Mom?

22:43.625 --> 22:45.500
I'm fine. He looks great.

22:45.583 --> 22:46.708
Thanks.

22:46.791 --> 22:48.833
Your first time
around this many Black people?

22:49.500 --> 22:51.666
No. No, I'm fine-- It's-- I'm...

22:53.875 --> 22:55.166
-Fine.
-Mm-hm.

22:55.666 --> 22:58.250
Look. My number's on here.

22:58.333 --> 23:01.291
If he can't catch me here at the shop,
try me at the crib.

23:01.375 --> 23:03.583
-It's a little more private.
-Thank you.

23:03.666 --> 23:04.958
What can I get you?

23:06.125 --> 23:07.291
Yeah.

23:07.375 --> 23:11.375
They gonna need some shea butter,
a couple of those essential oils,

23:11.458 --> 23:14.125
about three or four satin durags,

23:14.208 --> 23:17.583
I'm thinkin' some spray bottles,
moisturizer.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.333
That shampoo.

23:20.416 --> 23:23.250
Let's see. Yeah, make sure
you get him some tea tree oil too,

23:23.333 --> 23:26.625
for the scalp, rub that on the braids.

23:26.708 --> 23:28.166
Okey-doke.

23:31.250 --> 23:33.000
You'll get the hang of it. Don't trip.

23:41.041 --> 23:43.125
Look, I'm not even gonna front.

23:43.208 --> 23:44.458
When I got my hair braided,

23:44.541 --> 23:47.750
my swag went from zero to 100 real quick.

23:49.166 --> 23:51.416
Your boy was feeling pristine.

23:54.291 --> 23:55.583
You know how you were a kid,

23:55.666 --> 24:00.291
and you'd get a new pair of shoes
and you just know you can run faster?

24:00.375 --> 24:04.166
Well, cornrows made me feel like
I was faster on the football field...

24:04.958 --> 24:08.458
-...jumping higher on the basketball court

24:08.541 --> 24:11.916
and feeling confident about my skills.
Doing the most.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.916
Everything but paying attention
to the deterioration of my braids.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.666
-In this moment, I felt invincible.

24:18.750 --> 24:20.750
I was the man. The world was my--

24:20.833 --> 24:24.125
Boy, you need some moisturizer
or somethin', because your hair is a mess.

24:25.708 --> 24:30.750
I mean, yeah, over time,
I noticed some frizz, but... damn!

24:30.833 --> 24:32.333
That was brutal.

24:32.416 --> 24:35.833
-I tried to use the recommended products.

24:35.916 --> 24:38.958
But nothing brought back
that fresh feeling.

24:39.041 --> 24:41.250
I guess it was time to get braided again.

24:42.833 --> 24:45.916
Hi. Yeah. It's-- It's Colin.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.250
I was wondering if you--
If you could get me in.

25:11.583 --> 25:14.208
-It's 3657, right?
-Yeah. This is-- For sure.

25:22.750 --> 25:24.666
How long do you think this is gonna last?

25:25.791 --> 25:27.500
What, the braids?

25:28.083 --> 25:29.458
All of it.

25:32.375 --> 25:34.208
Hey. Y'all made it.

25:34.291 --> 25:35.875
-Hi.
-Hey.

25:36.458 --> 25:37.666
Hi. Come on in.

25:52.416 --> 25:54.333
We just got done eatin'. Y'all hungry?

25:54.416 --> 25:55.541
-Yeah.
-No, thanks.

25:55.625 --> 25:57.083
Um, I'll have some.

25:58.916 --> 26:00.333
-Please.
-Okay.

26:03.166 --> 26:06.000
He's at the age where he eats all day.

26:08.750 --> 26:10.500
-Can I have this?
-Yeah.

26:14.125 --> 26:16.333
-Thank you.
-All right.

26:16.416 --> 26:19.416
You can sit on the floor.
Eat while I do your hair.

26:19.500 --> 26:20.750
Mm-hm.

26:36.125 --> 26:39.291
You're gonna want salt and pepper though.
He puts it on everything.

26:39.375 --> 26:42.000
No, no. This doesn't need it.
This is good.

27:05.416 --> 27:08.250
I'm gonna run a few errands,
so I'll be back in a couple hours.

27:11.958 --> 27:12.916
All right.

27:28.375 --> 27:33.041
I was back, feeling fresh,
focused, and strong.

27:40.708 --> 27:42.666
-Nice job.
-There you go.

27:42.750 --> 27:44.791
What's up with Kaepernick?

27:44.875 --> 27:46.500
That's a nice arm on him, huh?

27:46.583 --> 27:48.833
I'm talking about the hair. Jesus.

27:48.916 --> 27:50.208
Glove down, would ya?

27:51.500 --> 27:52.625
What about it?

27:53.708 --> 27:56.458
What--?
Are you looking at what I'm looking at?

27:56.541 --> 28:00.458
Something climbing out the back
of his hat. That is not acceptable.

28:00.541 --> 28:05.208
But what I didn't realize is
what one person embraces,

28:05.291 --> 28:07.333
another person despises.

28:08.791 --> 28:09.708
Whew!

28:18.666 --> 28:21.208
Mom said your baseball coach called today.

28:23.083 --> 28:24.000
About what?

28:26.416 --> 28:28.000
They want you to cut your hair.

28:30.541 --> 28:31.375
What?

28:34.125 --> 28:36.791
You have to cut your hair
if you're gonna stay on the team.

28:39.125 --> 28:41.916
Oh. You're-- You're joking, right?

28:42.000 --> 28:45.208
This is about your "brain energy" thing
or whatever?

28:45.291 --> 28:46.875
It's a team rule, Colin.

28:47.666 --> 28:50.291
-What team rule?
-Well, it makes sense.

28:51.166 --> 28:53.916
Truth be told, you do look unprofessional.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.833
Unprofessional?

28:55.916 --> 28:58.333
Why am I supposed to look professional?

28:59.625 --> 29:01.041
I'm 14. I'm a kid.

29:01.125 --> 29:04.000
Okay. Rules are rules.

29:04.833 --> 29:05.875
What rule?

29:07.375 --> 29:08.916
I play on that team every year,

29:09.000 --> 29:11.041
-and I've never heard of this.
-Well...

29:12.166 --> 29:15.791
if you wanna play this year,
you'll do what your coaches say.

29:22.166 --> 29:23.625
You guys won't talk to them?

29:24.875 --> 29:27.166
You think they should change
the rules for you?

29:27.250 --> 29:30.375
No, but it's a stupid rule,
whatever it is.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.625
-You're cutting your hair, Colin.
-I don't want to.

29:33.708 --> 29:35.083
-Too bad.
-Why?

29:35.166 --> 29:37.041
We told you. It's a team rule.

29:37.125 --> 29:40.166
-But why?
-Because you look like a thug.

29:44.541 --> 29:45.500
What?

29:55.958 --> 29:57.625
What is a thug?

29:59.958 --> 30:01.666
The earliest use of the word "thug"

30:01.750 --> 30:04.000
described a religious group
called Thuggee,

30:04.083 --> 30:06.041
who worshiped the god Kali.

30:06.125 --> 30:09.250
If you've seen
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,

30:09.333 --> 30:12.166
you've seen the Western
world's depiction of the Thuggee.

30:16.208 --> 30:19.416
But I'm sure that's not what's meant
when someone's called a thug today.

30:21.916 --> 30:24.916
So let's take a look at a more
contemporary definition.

30:25.583 --> 30:27.208
A quick Google search will tell you

30:27.291 --> 30:29.416
that a thug is described
as a violent person,

30:29.500 --> 30:30.875
especially a criminal.

30:30.958 --> 30:34.083
A ruffian, hoodlum, bully.

30:34.166 --> 30:38.833
Examples of this would be a Nazi
or a skinhead. Even some politicians.

30:38.916 --> 30:41.666
Very fine people on both sides.

30:41.750 --> 30:46.000
When you see these thugs--
I said, "Please don't be too nice."

30:46.083 --> 30:48.541
No one's looking online
for the definition of a thug.

30:48.625 --> 30:52.291
The medium that informs us
more than any other is television.

30:52.958 --> 30:55.958
So let's take a look
at how TV defines the word.

30:56.041 --> 30:58.208
I wanna get your response to some violence

30:58.291 --> 31:02.333
outside events of yours
that's committed by people opposed to you.

31:02.416 --> 31:05.000
-By thugs. By thugs.
-What is your message--?

31:05.083 --> 31:06.791
-No justice!
-No peace!

31:06.875 --> 31:08.458
-No racist!
-Police!

31:08.541 --> 31:12.333
And that wasn't-- Remember this.
That wasn't friendly protesters.

31:13.166 --> 31:16.208
They were thugs. They were thugs.

31:17.250 --> 31:19.000
So I guess that's what it is.

31:19.083 --> 31:22.916
Some people get called thugs just
for standing up for their human rights.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.208
While others get called more polite terms.

31:26.291 --> 31:28.416
I've seen officers with their guns drawn

31:28.500 --> 31:32.541
in a confrontation with these people
who have entered the capital.

31:32.625 --> 31:35.916
This is a huge victory
for these protesters.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.333
I know your pain.

31:37.416 --> 31:41.625
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

31:41.708 --> 31:45.625
-I know you're hurt.
-Hang Mike Pence! Hang Mike Pence!

31:45.708 --> 31:49.333
We love you. You're very special.

31:49.416 --> 31:50.958
But they think I'm a thug?

31:51.041 --> 31:53.333
Not because I'm a violent criminal.

31:54.625 --> 31:56.416
Because they said so.

31:56.500 --> 31:59.125
You have to play by the rules, Colin.

32:00.291 --> 32:04.083
Your mother and I would not tell you
to do something if it wasn't okay.

32:04.166 --> 32:05.000
Right?

32:07.166 --> 32:08.750
If it wasn't for your own good.

32:19.083 --> 32:20.083
Okay.

32:28.416 --> 32:31.458
After that,
I didn't get braids again

32:31.541 --> 32:33.916
for another 14 years.

32:36.083 --> 32:37.791
I never felt good about it.

32:40.291 --> 32:41.791
I knew it wasn't right.

32:43.791 --> 32:48.000
But I didn't have the knowledge,
wisdom, or language to fight back.

32:50.458 --> 32:53.166
I couldn't rebel
because I didn't know how.

32:56.750 --> 32:57.750
But now?

33:01.500 --> 33:02.833
Now I know how.

33:03.750 --> 33:04.875
And I will.
