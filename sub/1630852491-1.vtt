Previously on This Is Us...

00:03.204 --> 00:04.538
It appears you have

00:04.572 --> 00:07.908
what we doctors call
mild cognitive impairment.

00:07.941 --> 00:09.410
There is a chance that,
over time,

00:09.443 --> 00:11.712
you'll experience
more difficulty with memory.

00:11.745 --> 00:14.415
They are gonna want me in
San Francisco three days a week.

00:14.448 --> 00:15.683
KATE:
We can do this.

00:16.884 --> 00:18.886
I don't want any trouble.

00:18.919 --> 00:21.189
None of the jewelry from here
or my nightstand is missing.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.092
My cufflinks were in here.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.559
He was in our room.

00:25.593 --> 00:28.829
I can't marry someone
who's not in love with me.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.399
-Please don't do this.
-Kevin,

00:31.432 --> 00:33.567
you know it.

00:34.935 --> 00:36.604

by REO Speedwagon playing)

00:41.642 --> 00:43.444
(tableware clinking)

00:54.422 --> 00:56.757
(sighs) Is it just me
or will this go down

00:56.790 --> 00:58.959
as one
of the all-time great songs?

00:58.992 --> 01:01.061
-All-time great bands.
-Mm.

01:01.095 --> 01:03.631
REO Speedwagon
are the new Beatles.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.899
-Remember I said that.
-(laughs)

01:05.933 --> 01:08.536
-* What started out
as friendship *
-Oh.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.872
-* Has grown stronger *
-(laughs)

01:11.905 --> 01:15.476
* I only wish I had the strength
to let it show *

01:15.509 --> 01:17.111
Oh, you're letting it show.

01:17.145 --> 01:18.812
-I am?
-Mm-hmm.

01:18.846 --> 01:20.614
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

01:20.648 --> 01:21.882
KATE:
Okay!

01:21.915 --> 01:23.584
Break it up, people.

01:23.617 --> 01:24.918
Big day.

01:24.952 --> 01:27.121
-Big day.
-I know. Hey, guys.

01:27.155 --> 01:29.490
See what I have for you
in honor of today?

01:29.523 --> 01:30.991
Tang!

01:31.024 --> 01:32.426
-BIG THREE: Tang!
-Slow. No, hold on, hold on.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.128
-Hold on.
-Whoa! Slow down.

01:34.162 --> 01:36.096
Slow down.
Okay, look, Dad's off.

01:36.130 --> 01:37.097
-Mm-hmm.
-So goodbye kiss.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.899
Kiss. Kiss.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.768
I want all the details later.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.836
Um... briefcase?

01:42.870 --> 01:44.104
In the living room.

01:44.138 --> 01:44.972
What would I do without you?

01:45.005 --> 01:46.274
You'd lose your briefcase a lot.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.676
I would lose my mind.
Every detail...

01:48.709 --> 01:50.244
-I want to hear
all about it later.
-Bye, Dad.

01:50.278 --> 01:52.746
-BIG THREE: Bye!
-Bye!
-Okay, breakfast. Breakfast.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.982

-TOM MINTIER:
The ice is cleared away

01:55.015 --> 01:57.885
-and Challenger
should be going away very soon.

-* I only wish I had *
-Let's go down to the Kennedy
Space Center and take a look

02:00.120 --> 02:01.689
-at Challenger
sitting on the pad...
-* The strength to let it show *

02:01.722 --> 02:03.524
...as they continue
the countdown.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.092
They started
the auxiliary power units

02:05.125 --> 02:07.695
about a minute ago, and...

02:21.575 --> 02:23.477
* But I'm afraid
to be near you *

02:23.511 --> 02:25.479
-Suit's on?
-Yes, ma'am.

02:25.513 --> 02:27.281
* And I don't know *

02:27.315 --> 02:29.550
* Where to begin *

02:29.583 --> 02:31.118
(humming)

02:31.151 --> 02:32.853
-* And I don't know *
-(grunts)

02:32.886 --> 02:35.723
* Where to begin *

02:37.157 --> 02:39.693
* Somewhere in the desert *

02:39.727 --> 02:42.330
* There's a forest *

02:42.363 --> 02:45.132
* And an acre before us *

02:45.165 --> 02:46.734
* But I don't know *

02:46.767 --> 02:50.404
* Where to begin *

02:50.438 --> 02:54.808
* But I don't know
where to begin *

02:54.842 --> 02:59.580
* Again, I lost my strength
completely *

-(door opens)
-WOMAN: Got a sec, boss?

03:17.698 --> 03:20.200
Yeah. What's up?

03:20.234 --> 03:24.505
* Happy birthday to you *

03:24.538 --> 03:26.407
(quietly):
Yeah...

03:26.440 --> 03:28.041
-(chuckles)

03:59.573 --> 04:02.610
You know, when I think it
all went wrong for me was 1986.

04:02.643 --> 04:03.911
They were sending the Challenger
up into space.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.112
You remember the Challenger,
right?

04:05.145 --> 04:07.315
-Yeah. With Sandra Bullock?
-No.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.450
-(babbles)
-What'd you say?
You said "happy birthday"?

04:09.483 --> 04:11.118
Well, thank you, Franny.

04:11.151 --> 04:12.620
I'm sorry, what is that, Nicky?
You said...

04:12.653 --> 04:14.121
Oh, you said I don't look
old enough to be a daddy?

04:14.154 --> 04:16.390
Well, you know
exactly what to say.

04:16.424 --> 04:18.459
-(fussing)
-Yes, you do.
Oh, what does that mean?

04:18.492 --> 04:20.594
We ready for the mommy drop-off?

04:20.628 --> 04:23.431
-Here we go.
-(whirring)

04:23.464 --> 04:25.599
All right. I'm gonna get
a change of clothes

04:25.633 --> 04:27.335
and we're out of here.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.437
-(scrubbing)
-Knock-knock. Coming in hot.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.104
-Nicky is ripe.
-Oh.

04:31.138 --> 04:33.140
-Give me that stinky boy.
-Yeah.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.475
-That's
really something special.
-Oh, come here.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.276
(sniffs)
Oh!

04:36.310 --> 04:37.678
-That is a good one!
-(chuckles)

04:37.711 --> 04:39.447
That's a good one.

04:39.480 --> 04:42.149
Is it weird
that I love that smell?

04:42.182 --> 04:43.651
Rhetorical.
Aware that it's weird.

04:43.684 --> 04:44.952
Not gonna apologize for it.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.286
-(chuckles)
-Thank you

04:46.320 --> 04:47.655
for letting me sleep in,
by the way.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.256
-I needed that.
-'Course.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.458
Yeah, no,
that's what I'm here for.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.593
That's what I'm here for. Right?

04:52.626 --> 04:54.362
Oh, by the way, Nicky, uh...
Nicky's nap

04:54.395 --> 04:56.096
got cut a little short, so you
might want to put him down early

04:56.129 --> 04:57.264
-for the next one.
-Got it.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.599
Franny's diaper rash?

04:58.632 --> 05:00.534
Still looks like her butthole
got sunburned,

05:00.568 --> 05:01.969
but we're on the upswing,
I think.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.537
Right? On the ups...
Oh, and, um,

05:03.571 --> 05:04.705
I brought you back your...

05:04.738 --> 05:05.806
your air popper.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.308
Cleaned it for you
and everything.

05:08.342 --> 05:10.277
-MADISON: Uh-huh.
-What?

05:10.310 --> 05:11.278
VoilÃ .

05:11.311 --> 05:12.680
Ah.
(chuckles)

05:12.713 --> 05:13.981
It's even got the, you know--

05:14.014 --> 05:16.049
the same little, uh, lid
for melting butter.

05:16.083 --> 05:19.152
-Look at that.
-It is pretty much the Porsche
of air poppers.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.054
-Yeah, a man could pop some
serious corn with this thing.
-(chuckles)

05:21.088 --> 05:22.523
This is...

05:22.556 --> 05:23.791
Thank you.

05:23.824 --> 05:24.825
You're welcome. No.

05:24.858 --> 05:25.826
No, I...

05:25.859 --> 05:26.827
Happy birthday.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.228
Oh, uh...

05:28.261 --> 05:29.397
Thank you.

05:29.430 --> 05:30.998
-'Kay.
-Thanks.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.800
-What?
-You see?

05:32.833 --> 05:34.635
People thought it was a horrible
idea, after you jilted me

05:34.668 --> 05:36.236
at the altar,
me moving in here to be close

05:36.269 --> 05:38.205
-to the kids.
-I did not jilt you
at the altar.

05:38.238 --> 05:40.340
You jilted me, for sure.
But look at us now.

05:40.374 --> 05:43.176
We are-we are one finely tuned
co-parenting instrument.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.713
We are pretty much the Porsche

05:45.746 --> 05:48.015
-of slightly awkward co-parents.
-That we are.

05:48.048 --> 05:51.184
Okay, so don't forget
to lube up Franny, all right?

05:51.218 --> 05:53.421
And I'm gonna go, um,
to this stupid meeting,

05:53.454 --> 05:54.722
and then I'm gonna
come back here, grab the kids.

05:54.755 --> 05:57.525
I'll take 'em to Kate's
for the party, so...

05:57.558 --> 05:58.692
And you're sure
you don't want to go?

06:00.060 --> 06:03.063
It's a family birthday party,
Kevin, and...

06:03.096 --> 06:05.032
I'm good. I'm good.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.334
I'm, uh, hosting book club here
today anyways.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.269
Ah. Yes, book club.
Love those nerds.

06:09.302 --> 06:11.505
Okay,
just because we enjoy reading

06:11.539 --> 06:13.441
and discussing
fantasy literature does not mean

06:13.474 --> 06:16.009
-we are nerds.
-Huh.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.678
-You know, get out of my house.
-Okay.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.447
-Get. Go.
-All right, kids.
All right, all right.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.848
-Bye, guys. Bye.
-Say bye-bye. Say "bye, Daddy."

06:20.881 --> 06:22.382
Say bye-bye. Bye.

06:22.416 --> 06:23.717
Okay.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.252
Some strawberries.

06:25.285 --> 06:26.687
Yum.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.055
Here's some water for you.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.156
Okay?

06:35.996 --> 06:37.931
(FaceTime ringing)

06:41.401 --> 06:43.871
Well, think of the devil.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.639
Okay, first,
let me say that I hate

06:45.673 --> 06:48.041
that I'm doing this
over FaceTime and not in person

06:48.075 --> 06:49.777
and that there happens to be
a 24-second shot clock

06:49.810 --> 06:52.045
on the whole thing,
since a prematurely balding man

06:52.079 --> 06:54.648
is about to walk into my office
and blow up my entire day.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.617
(inhales) So I just wanted
to call you really quick

06:56.650 --> 06:58.385
and say happy birthday, Kate.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.554
I love you very much,
and I miss you.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.590
Aw. I miss you, too.

07:02.623 --> 07:03.824
You sound stressed.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.926
No wasting time on me.
Now, listen,

07:05.959 --> 07:08.328
I know you have the day off,
so I have arranged for your mom

07:08.361 --> 07:10.631
and Miguel to take the kids
to Train Park.

07:10.664 --> 07:13.133
With Nicky, of course, since
they're all attached at the hip

07:13.166 --> 07:14.301
since he started staying
with them.

07:14.334 --> 07:16.003
Wait, they're taking the kids?

07:16.036 --> 07:18.005
For the entire afternoon.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.273
And you, my beautiful wife,

07:20.307 --> 07:23.143
get a peaceful, childless house
for the whole day.

07:23.176 --> 07:26.079
I have a massage therapist
showing up in one hour.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.314
And don't worry--
I know what you like.

07:27.347 --> 07:28.582
I asked for a woman
with the hands

07:28.616 --> 07:29.650
of an offensive lineman.

07:29.683 --> 07:30.918
(chuckles)

07:30.951 --> 07:32.920
Toby...

07:32.953 --> 07:34.121
And the shot clock is going off.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.489
Okay, I love you very much.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.791
Happy birthday.
Kiss the munchkins for me, okay

07:37.825 --> 07:39.660
Oh, my God, here they come.
All right. Okay, bye.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.662
-Love you.
-I love you...
-(beeping)

07:41.695 --> 07:43.697
...too.

07:45.833 --> 07:48.301
Look at this.

07:48.335 --> 07:49.603
Oh, my God.

07:49.637 --> 07:50.971
He's so romantic.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.305
I know.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.742
No, I-I miss him so much
it hurts.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.878
Malik sending you love letters
from Boston?

07:57.911 --> 08:00.614
Huh? Aw, that's adorbs.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.415
That boy is adorbs.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.853
You know, your dad
used to send me love letters

08:05.886 --> 08:07.287
on our summer break.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.558
Like, full-on,
cursive, handwritten...

08:10.591 --> 08:11.725
Y'all not listening. Okay.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.460
That's fair. Hey!

08:13.493 --> 08:15.729
There's
my romantic birthday boy.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.531
You decide on your wish yet?

08:17.565 --> 08:19.700
Can we go in the next room,
please?

08:19.733 --> 08:22.169
Okay.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.037
-It's all kind of one room,
but okay.
-Mm.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.843
Um...
(clears throat)

08:29.877 --> 08:31.879
Got an email.

08:31.912 --> 08:34.414
The cops got the guy
who robbed us.

08:34.447 --> 08:36.349
-(gasps)
-Caught him breaking into
a parked car.

08:36.383 --> 08:38.185
Wow.

08:38.218 --> 08:40.420
-Are they sure it's our guy?
-Mm-hmm.

08:40.453 --> 08:43.991
He pawned all of our jewelry,
but, um...

08:44.024 --> 08:45.158
you remember
how we couldn't find

08:45.192 --> 08:46.994
one of our wedding photos
last year,

08:47.027 --> 08:48.662
-thought we were losing
our minds?
-Mm-hmm.

08:48.696 --> 08:49.997
He had it on him.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.865
Just the picture, not the frame.

08:51.899 --> 08:52.866
(groans)

08:52.900 --> 08:54.568
Yeah.

08:54.602 --> 08:56.036
He's, um...

08:56.069 --> 08:58.371
he's getting arraigned today.

08:58.405 --> 08:59.773
I think I might go down there.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.508
Randall,

09:01.541 --> 09:02.910
-it's your birthday.
-I want to look him

09:02.943 --> 09:05.045
in the eye, Beth,
tell him what he did to us.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.747
-To our family.
-Okay. Baby,

09:06.780 --> 09:08.782
-let's play a game, okay?
-Hmm.

09:08.816 --> 09:11.251
-There's two doors
you can choose from today.
-(inhales deeply)

09:11.284 --> 09:13.553
-(sighs)
-Behind door number one

09:13.587 --> 09:16.924
-is your beautiful, "top
of her game right now" wife...
-Yeah.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.792
...who is fulfilled
in her new job

09:18.826 --> 09:20.861
and-and has a new skincare line

09:20.894 --> 09:23.530
-that has her
positively glowing.
-That's true.

09:23.563 --> 09:27.034
She is clicking
on all her sexy cylinders.

09:27.067 --> 09:31.071
-Mmm.
-And is ready to grant you
any birthday wish you want.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.874
-Mmm.
-Like a less-problematic
Aladdin genie.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.075
-I like that.
-Yeah.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.745
-Yeah.
-Behind door number two,

09:37.778 --> 09:41.114
you have confronting the creeper
who broke into our home

09:41.148 --> 09:42.950
and upturned
a year of our lives.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.888
You're gonna pick
door number two, aren't you?

09:47.921 --> 09:49.322
-I need to look him in the eye,
Beth.
-Oh, my gosh.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.491
-You are a very unusual man.
-I know.

09:51.524 --> 09:52.893
But you really are at the top

09:52.926 --> 09:54.327
-of your game right...
-No, no, no.

09:54.361 --> 09:56.596
You only get one door, baby.
You made your choice.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.398
All right? Hey, ladies?

09:58.431 --> 10:00.200
Mom-mobile's leaving in three.
All right?

10:01.702 --> 10:03.436
Damn.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.438
I would've chose
door number Beth.

10:05.472 --> 10:08.241
Mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.843
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

10:09.877 --> 10:11.945
(departing footsteps)

10:16.049 --> 10:18.351
(kids chattering)

10:20.320 --> 10:21.288
Kevin!

10:23.123 --> 10:24.524
Class. Class!

10:24.557 --> 10:26.860
Kevin, please.

10:26.894 --> 10:29.096
(soft chuckling)

10:29.129 --> 10:30.698
-CNN ANCHOR: ...now underway...
-Okay.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.966
-in minus 15 seconds.
-Here we go.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.602
-(Kevin cackles)
-Kevin, please settle.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.772
MAN:
T-minus ten, nine, eight,

10:38.806 --> 10:40.007
seven, six.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.976
We have main engines start.

10:43.010 --> 10:46.346
Four, three, two, one...

10:46.379 --> 10:49.382
-and liftoff, liftoff
-(kids cheering)

10:49.416 --> 10:51.551
of the 25th space
shuttle mission,

10:51.584 --> 10:53.486
and it has cleared the tower.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.388
(indistinct chatter on TV)

10:59.092 --> 11:02.195
TOM MINTER:
So, the 25th space shuttle
mission is now on the way

11:02.229 --> 11:05.999
after more delays
than NASA cares to count.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.500
This morning
they looked as though

11:07.534 --> 11:09.669
they were not going to be
able to get off.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.848
(distorted chatter on TV)

11:23.616 --> 11:25.485
MINTER:
Looks like a couple of the, uh,

11:25.518 --> 11:28.756
solid rocket boosters,
uh, blew away

11:28.789 --> 11:33.226
from the side of the shuttle
in an explosion.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.933
MAN:
My controller's here, looking
very carefully at the situation

11:39.967 --> 11:43.236
-Obviously a major malfunction.
-It seems that...

11:45.873 --> 11:48.441
I think they're having
a little problem there.

11:56.616 --> 11:58.819
MIGUEL:
Hey, guess what, guys.

11:58.852 --> 12:01.354
Did you know that this train
goes all the way around the park

12:01.388 --> 12:05.025
-two whole times?
-(gasps) Two whole times?

12:05.058 --> 12:06.794
You hear that?

12:06.827 --> 12:08.395
How is this my life?

12:08.428 --> 12:10.063
(chuckles):
Would you stop bitching?

12:10.097 --> 12:13.100
Yeah, I'm sorry. It's just
this damn Facebook. I-I..

12:13.133 --> 12:15.468
You know what, every morning
since I got here,

12:15.502 --> 12:17.938
I Facebook stalk the girl
who got away.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.139
I told you about her, right?

12:19.172 --> 12:20.874
-Sally?
-Sally, yes.

12:20.908 --> 12:23.143
-Yeah.
-Yes, you tell us about
her every day.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.312
Every single day.

12:25.345 --> 12:28.448
Well, every single day,
I lose my nerve,

12:28.481 --> 12:31.051
even though she's just
a few hours from here.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.620
(sighs) Here I am
on a baby train.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.655
Oh, Nicky, shush.

12:35.688 --> 12:37.424
And who doesn't like trains?

12:37.457 --> 12:39.626
-Everybody likes trains.
-JACK: Yeah.

12:39.659 --> 12:41.261
Hey, Jack.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.496
Did I ever tell you how my dad
used to take me on trains

12:43.530 --> 12:44.764
when I was a little girl?

12:44.798 --> 12:47.100
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.736
Any Sunday my dad
had to go into the office,

12:49.769 --> 12:53.106
he would, uh, take me on the
train into the city with him.

12:53.140 --> 12:56.944
Mmm. I loved those Sundays.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.115
My dad would, uh,
sit there reading--

13:02.149 --> 13:04.818
he was a big reader, my dad,
novels mainly--

13:04.852 --> 13:08.755
and, uh, I'd sit across from him
just watching

13:08.788 --> 13:12.125
the world go by
as the train rumbled beneath us

13:12.159 --> 13:14.161
(chuckles)

13:14.194 --> 13:15.963
And then, when we would get
close to the city,

13:15.996 --> 13:18.531
he would walk me to
the very front of the train,

13:18.565 --> 13:20.300
and we'd walk back

13:20.333 --> 13:22.335
through each and every car.

13:22.369 --> 13:23.770
All the way.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.638
All the way to the back,
to the...

13:27.540 --> 13:29.342
The, um...

13:30.577 --> 13:33.981
Oh, the-the last car.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.549
No, no, no, no. D-Don't te...
Don't tell me.

13:36.583 --> 13:37.851
(train engine sputters)

13:37.885 --> 13:39.652
(engine revs)

13:39.686 --> 13:41.088
(quietly):
The last...

13:42.555 --> 13:45.492
Oh, that was amazing.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.394
-I'm a new woman.
-I'm glad.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.462
Your husband's very thoughtful.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.398
I wish mine would order me
a me on my birthday.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.733
Yeah. It's very Toby.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.537
Actually, it isn't.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.239
He's usually more of, like,
a giant in-person

13:59.272 --> 14:01.308
grand gesture kind of guy.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.743
This outsourcing is
a little new.

14:03.776 --> 14:06.713
Not to say it's not wonderful
and much needed and...

14:06.746 --> 14:09.016
-You know, honestly,
it's simpler.
-(phone vibrates)

14:14.754 --> 14:16.189
(groans softly)

14:17.424 --> 14:19.226
(knocks)

14:19.259 --> 14:20.593
Kevin Pearson.

14:20.627 --> 14:23.063
(sighs) Send him in.

14:24.932 --> 14:26.399
Thank you.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.037
Casey.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.538
What, it's been, um...

14:31.571 --> 14:33.606
Five years.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.742
Five years to the day
since your national meltdown

14:35.775 --> 14:37.777
-on my set.
-You counted.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.679
You count, Kevin,

14:39.712 --> 14:42.382
when somebody torpedoes
your life and career,

14:42.415 --> 14:43.750
-you count.
-Huh.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.420
I supposed you would, but hey,

14:47.454 --> 14:48.956
looks like you landed
on your feet, though, right?

14:48.989 --> 14:50.190
I mean, this is
a hell of a show.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.059
The writing is phenomenal.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.060
I never worked on it.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.462
I'm a fan.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.164
Oh.

15:00.033 --> 15:02.135
Look, man, I...

15:02.169 --> 15:03.903
We both know we were forced

15:03.937 --> 15:05.905
to take this meeting
by our agents, right?

15:05.939 --> 15:07.574
I mean, y-you don't want me
to do whatever movie this is.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.376
I don't want to do
whatever movie this is.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.111
They want to reboot The Manny,
Kevin.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.816
-So...
-There is no film.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.818
They knew you'd
never show up if...

15:18.851 --> 15:20.287
Let me get this straight.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.222
-They want me to play
the Manny again?
-What?

15:22.255 --> 15:24.791
No, you're far too old.

15:24.824 --> 15:26.226
No, you play the dad.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.428
A dad to twins, ironically.

15:28.461 --> 15:29.596
Huh.

15:30.830 --> 15:33.100
Kevin, I-I saw the last film.

15:33.133 --> 15:36.303
I actually purchased a ticket.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.005
And after 90 minutes,
when I realized

15:38.038 --> 15:40.673
it was only halfway over,
I started to lick

15:40.707 --> 15:43.110
the movie theater seats in an
attempt to give myself COVID.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.677
Okay.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.148
I know what's out there for you
right now.

15:48.181 --> 15:49.582
This is good.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.285
You get to raise your family
in Los Angeles,

15:52.319 --> 15:55.022
work one day a week
and become a zillionaire.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.058
Or say no.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.392
And spend the rest of your years

15:59.426 --> 16:00.960
travelling to Vancouver
every weekend

16:00.994 --> 16:02.829
to shoot Treat Williams indies

16:02.862 --> 16:05.065
where you got to do
your own hair.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.441
Over my dead body.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.209
(sighs) Thank God.

16:19.246 --> 16:22.682
Mr. Watkins, you are
being charged with burglary

16:22.715 --> 16:24.784
while in possession
of an offensive weapon

16:24.817 --> 16:26.553
and criminal trespass.

16:26.586 --> 16:30.190
-Do you understand the charges?
-WATKINS: Yes.

16:30.223 --> 16:33.526
MAGISTRATE:
Preliminary hearing will be set
for four weeks from today,

16:33.560 --> 16:37.197
and bail has been set as noted.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.235
-(departing footsteps)
-(door opens)

16:44.904 --> 16:46.406
(door closes)

16:49.042 --> 16:51.711
Excuse me, Officer, um...

16:51.744 --> 16:55.014
-Randall Pearson, councilman
for District...
-District 12.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.549
Yes, sir.
My wife and I voted for you.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.118
We plan on doing it again.

16:58.151 --> 16:59.786
Well, that makes this
a lot easier.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.654
Um...

17:01.688 --> 17:03.556
Do you think I could speak
with him for a couple minutes?

17:04.857 --> 17:06.326
Sure thing, Councilman.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.260
I'll be right here
if you need me.

17:16.469 --> 17:19.106
Do you know who I am?

17:23.042 --> 17:26.079
You're the guy from my picture.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.624
(door opens)

17:42.595 --> 17:44.897
(Jack sighs)

17:44.931 --> 17:46.633
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:51.471 --> 17:52.872
How are they?

17:52.905 --> 17:55.908
Oh, they barely said a word
on the ride home.

17:55.942 --> 17:59.011
And I started their day out
with Tang, Jack.

17:59.045 --> 18:01.781
-With Tang.
-Yeah. We'll talk to 'em, Bec.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.917
Just like we did
when the goldfish died.

18:04.951 --> 18:07.420
Uh, a spaceship
filled with heroes

18:07.454 --> 18:09.422
exploded on national television.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.124
I don't think
the Splishy and Splashy model

18:11.158 --> 18:13.092
-is gonna work here.
-Bec.

18:13.126 --> 18:15.795
We can do this.

18:15.828 --> 18:18.631
Okay? Okay.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.571
(approaching footsteps)

18:24.604 --> 18:26.906
Hey, Big Three.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.242
REBECCA:
Hey, guys?

18:29.276 --> 18:31.744
Uh, Daddy and I just...
we wanted to see

18:31.778 --> 18:34.947
if there is anything
that you wanted to talk about.

18:34.981 --> 18:36.349
About today?

18:40.119 --> 18:44.123
'Cause I know, for me...

18:44.157 --> 18:47.360
I had a lot of sad feelings.

18:47.394 --> 18:50.363
-Did any of you maybe
feel like that?
-JACK: Yeah.

18:50.397 --> 18:54.534
You know, like maybe
when Splishy and Splashy...

18:54.567 --> 18:55.602
(whispers):
Don't do Splishy and Splashy.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.604
I'm telling you,
it's a good way in.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.172
All the teachers were crying.

19:00.407 --> 19:01.808
Yeah.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.876
I bet they were, Bug.

19:03.910 --> 19:07.214
It's a good thing
they were that high up.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.516
That means they were
closer to heaven.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.185
Yeah.

19:12.219 --> 19:14.387
I think that's
a really nice thought, Bug.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.658
Maybe Splishy and Splashy will
take care of them.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.532
Boys, how about you?

19:25.565 --> 19:28.201
You-you guys feeling
a little sad, too?

19:30.403 --> 19:32.672
Can I have more mac and cheese?

19:34.874 --> 19:36.409
Yeah.

19:36.443 --> 19:37.410
-REBECCA: I can get it.
-No, no.

19:37.444 --> 19:39.412
I got it, I got it. I got it.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.553
-ELIJAH: So good.
-Look who's back.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.555
-(Madison chuckles)
-How was book... club?

19:48.588 --> 19:50.890
Oh, hey. You remember Elijah,
right? From book club?

19:52.191 --> 19:54.093
-(baby fusing over monitor)
-No, I mean, yeah. (stammers)

19:54.126 --> 19:55.895
I didn't realize, uh...

19:55.928 --> 19:57.430
I didn't realize
everyone was still here.

19:57.464 --> 19:59.499
Oh, I'm just helping Maddy
clean up.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.834
She always hosts
and gets stuck with it.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.703
Well, that's nice.

20:05.472 --> 20:06.939
I'm just gonna grab the kids
and take them to the party.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.508
Oh, perfect timing.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.443
They are just starting to stir
from their naps.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.012
(softly):
Good.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.281
How was book club?

20:14.314 --> 20:16.215
-Oh, my God. (chuckles)
-So good.

20:16.249 --> 20:17.784
We read The Queen
of the Tearling.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.419
-(imitates explosion)
-Everybody's mind was blown.

20:19.452 --> 20:22.289
Yeah, n... Eli called me
a Kelsea today,

20:22.322 --> 20:24.891
-so he is basically
my best friend for life.
-(Elijah laughs)

20:24.924 --> 20:26.593
-Well, I only speak the truth.
-Aw.

20:28.395 --> 20:29.729
Oh, you haven't read it?

20:29.762 --> 20:31.197
Not a page.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.733
You know,
the last thing I read was, um...

20:33.766 --> 20:34.801
was Parasite.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.036
Subtitled movie.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.238
-Kev, considers it reading.
-Well, it's Korean,

20:39.272 --> 20:40.740
so you have to read it
to understand it,

20:40.773 --> 20:42.241
unless you speak Korean, so...

20:42.275 --> 20:44.477
Hey, I don't want to geek out
or anything...

20:44.511 --> 20:46.979
-Oh, Eli, maybe not now.
-I'm just gonna say it once.
You said I could.

20:47.013 --> 20:50.750
-Okay.
-Hill 400 is a freaking
masterpiece.

20:50.783 --> 20:51.984
-Yeah?
-You are so good, man.

20:52.018 --> 20:53.586
Thank you.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.087
Thank y... That's very kind.
I appreciate it.

20:55.121 --> 20:58.224
Um, so I'm-I'm gonna
grab the kids, right?

20:58.257 --> 20:59.926
And then Elijah and I will-will
get out of your hair.

21:01.227 --> 21:02.995
Unless you want help
with the dishes.

21:03.029 --> 21:04.497
Oh.

21:04.531 --> 21:07.133
Wow, that's so nice.
No, that would be huge.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.602
Who knew fantasy nerds
could be such slobs?

21:09.636 --> 21:12.071
Um, everyone who's ever
met a fantasy nerd.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.273
(laughs):
Right.

21:14.307 --> 21:16.175
Walked into that one.
Should we...

21:16.208 --> 21:17.777
-Hmm? Mm-hmm. Great.
-ELIJAH: Another bottle?
Yeah, absolutely...

21:17.810 --> 21:19.746
So, I'll just
grab the kids, then.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.848
-(Madison chuckles)
-ELIJAH: I, uh...
when I was, uh...

21:21.881 --> 21:23.816
(quiet chatter)

21:27.354 --> 21:29.221
My name is Randall Pearson.

21:30.723 --> 21:33.326
Two years ago,
you broke into my home.

21:33.360 --> 21:37.530
You broke through a window
and stole some jewelry.

21:37.564 --> 21:41.233
I caught you on the way out
with a knife.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.137
I don't remember.

21:47.306 --> 21:51.544
I have, uh, holes in my memory.

21:53.413 --> 21:54.414
Do you have any water?

21:56.349 --> 21:57.650
I don't.

21:57.684 --> 21:59.318
I can try to get you some.

21:59.352 --> 22:00.420
Thank you.

22:04.391 --> 22:07.727
It was a terrifying moment
for my family.

22:07.760 --> 22:11.163
My wife, my daughters.

22:11.197 --> 22:12.164
I'm sorry...

22:14.233 --> 22:17.069
You know what they did
with my dog?

22:19.406 --> 22:21.508
I don't. I can
try to find out for you.

22:25.545 --> 22:30.016
Yeah, I didn't know
where I got the picture from,

22:30.049 --> 22:31.951
but you looked happy in it.

22:34.186 --> 22:38.558
I thought maybe it came
from a good part of my life.

22:38.591 --> 22:40.727
But I guess it came
from a bad part.

22:44.230 --> 22:46.966
Do you know what they did
with my dog?

22:48.568 --> 22:50.369
I don't.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.543
JESS:
I hear you, you're just
not saying anything.

22:56.576 --> 22:59.512
Why? You haven't told me why.

22:59.546 --> 23:01.180
There is no why, Jess.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.749
I'm just not in a place...

23:02.782 --> 23:04.584
Don't you dare use
your traumatic past

23:04.617 --> 23:05.618
to try and get out of
this relationship, okay?

23:05.652 --> 23:06.653
That is not fair.

23:07.654 --> 23:09.055
I don't care if it's upsetting.

23:09.088 --> 23:11.724
I just need to know
so that I can move on.

23:16.829 --> 23:19.198
You bore me, Jessica.

23:19.231 --> 23:22.101
I mean, you are a stunning,

23:22.134 --> 23:24.871
intelligent, magnificent woman,

23:24.904 --> 23:26.539
and yet, every time we have
a meal together,

23:26.573 --> 23:30.376
I can't help but feel
like I'm watching paint dry.

23:30.409 --> 23:33.613
And I-I'll spare you the whole
"It's-it's not you, it's me"

23:33.646 --> 23:36.382
nonsense and remind you
to focus on the fact

23:36.415 --> 23:39.652
that you are a stunning,
intelligent,

23:39.686 --> 23:42.489
magnificent woman,
who's just wasting her time

23:42.522 --> 23:44.591
on a pasty English chap
who just equated

23:44.624 --> 23:47.326
eating sushi with you
to watching paint dry.

23:50.797 --> 23:52.799
Is-is that helpful?

23:52.832 --> 23:54.967
For moving on?

23:55.001 --> 23:57.837
You are a condescending prick.

23:57.870 --> 24:01.407
This would seem to be the common
refrain in my life, yes.

24:10.316 --> 24:11.918
What the hell was that?

24:11.951 --> 24:13.953
Oh, good. You're here, um...

24:13.986 --> 24:16.789
Oh, that was not the emergency.

24:16.823 --> 24:18.424
Oh, but speaking of which,

24:18.457 --> 24:20.359
I assure you,
I had nothing to do

24:20.392 --> 24:22.028
with what's about
to happen here.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.163
Come on.

24:26.365 --> 24:28.367
It's your birthday gift.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.869
They insisted.

24:29.902 --> 24:32.304
I think the whole thing's
completely overwrought,

24:32.338 --> 24:34.941
but who can say no to a bunch
of well-meaning blind kids

24:34.974 --> 24:36.943
with a soft spot
for their teacher?

24:36.976 --> 24:39.311
All right, go ahead, superstars.

You want to walk the train?

-REBECCA: Yes, please.
-DAVE: Okay.

25:45.244 --> 25:47.013
We'll start at the front

26:44.503 --> 26:46.739
You've been so quiet.

26:46.773 --> 26:49.909
I just wanted to check in
on you.

26:49.942 --> 26:52.011
You want to come and sit here
with me for a little bit?

26:55.682 --> 26:57.316
Okay.

26:57.349 --> 27:00.152
Well, I'll be downstairs
if you want to talk.

She has kids.

The astronaut teacher.

27:12.198 --> 27:14.200
I know.

27:14.233 --> 27:17.203
Do you think someone's
making them dinner?

27:20.339 --> 27:21.708
Um...

27:21.741 --> 27:23.609
Yeah, I bet their...

27:23.642 --> 27:25.878
I bet their dad's
making them dinner, hon.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.683
Maybe you can send them
macaroni and cheese,

27:30.717 --> 27:32.985
just in case.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.889
(chuckles softly)

27:38.590 --> 27:41.493
And so, you bailed him out?

27:41.527 --> 27:44.330
So he could meet me
at the shelter later.

27:44.363 --> 27:47.399
I'm arranging a bed for him
and meeting him there tonight

27:48.835 --> 27:52.371
It felt like a romantic
full circle kind of thing,

27:52.404 --> 27:53.639
I don't, I don't know.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.207
Oh, my God, Randall.

27:55.241 --> 27:57.209
-I don't even know what to say.
-I know.

27:59.145 --> 28:01.147
I saw his file, Beth.

28:04.616 --> 28:06.652
For the last two years,
this man has woken me

28:06.685 --> 28:09.989
from my dreams in a cold sweat.

28:10.022 --> 28:13.392
This man with the knife.

28:13.425 --> 28:15.828
But today I saw his file,

28:15.862 --> 28:18.597
and he had a name.

28:18.630 --> 28:20.466
It's David.

28:21.968 --> 28:24.236
The name with the knife,
his name is David.

28:25.872 --> 28:28.741
And he had a family.

28:28.775 --> 28:31.610
And he's someone's son.

28:31.643 --> 28:33.445
Could've been William.

28:33.479 --> 28:35.915
So...

28:35.948 --> 28:38.417
you look at this man,

28:38.450 --> 28:41.453
and you see sweet,
gentle William,

28:41.487 --> 28:44.556
-who would nev...
-It's not just William, Beth.

28:44.590 --> 28:47.726
I see Kev. I see my father.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.062
I see Laurel.

28:50.096 --> 28:52.098
I see a young Shauna.

28:53.732 --> 28:56.702
I see thousands of addicts
in my district

28:56.735 --> 29:00.106
I was elected to help, who I'm
not doing nearly enough for.

29:01.974 --> 29:03.475
I don't know.

29:07.479 --> 29:09.481
(exhales sharply)

29:09.515 --> 29:11.117
Okay.

29:13.285 --> 29:14.720
I'm-a give you one more shot.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.423
At what?

29:17.456 --> 29:20.759
This birthday genie wish thing.

29:20.793 --> 29:24.463
Door number one.
The whole shebang thing.

29:24.496 --> 29:26.899
Why?

29:26.933 --> 29:30.669
Because you...

29:30.702 --> 29:32.471
are the real thing, Randall.

29:32.504 --> 29:36.508
You know how many vices
men can have these days?

29:36.542 --> 29:40.579
Hmm? Gambling. Booze. Porn.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.281
Freaking fantasy football.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.683
And my guy...

29:44.716 --> 29:46.518
just wants to help people.

29:48.787 --> 29:51.523
It's compulsive
and over the top.

29:51.557 --> 29:53.692
And if that son of a bitch
doesn't show up tonight,

29:53.725 --> 29:54.994
I'm gonna lose it.

29:57.696 --> 29:59.498
But you...

29:59.531 --> 30:03.035
are an incredibly decent man,

30:03.069 --> 30:05.204
Randall Pearson.

30:05.237 --> 30:06.906
And it's your birthday.

30:08.875 --> 30:11.477
So... make a wish.

30:12.711 --> 30:14.680
I got my wish when I met you.

30:14.713 --> 30:16.748
Don't be cheesy now,
just get it done.

You walked with Dad
from the front to the back.

30:32.932 --> 30:36.035
It's not the boxcar.
It's not the engine.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.010
It was the name of the book.

30:44.043 --> 30:45.544
You read it every night.

30:49.882 --> 30:51.884

It's the red one.

The car at the end.

30:57.957 --> 31:00.292
The red car.

31:00.326 --> 31:01.760
The car at the end.

31:01.793 --> 31:04.063
The red one, damn it!

31:06.065 --> 31:07.967

31:14.140 --> 31:15.407
Um...

31:15.441 --> 31:17.209
I-I didn't want to tell you guys

31:17.243 --> 31:19.278
until after
your birthday, but...

31:20.712 --> 31:23.149
I... (sighs)

31:24.483 --> 31:26.919
I got the results
of the PET scan back,

31:26.953 --> 31:29.721
and...

31:29.755 --> 31:31.790
the scan is positive for

31:31.823 --> 31:34.493
plaques building in my brain.

31:36.595 --> 31:40.232
It's still very early, guys.

31:40.266 --> 31:43.302

extremely optimistic

to market.

talk much.

32:19.271 --> 32:22.975
You know,
if-if something happened,

32:23.009 --> 32:26.645
and it made me feel happy
or made me feel sad,

32:26.678 --> 32:29.681
you know, we-we wouldn't
really analyze it.

32:32.384 --> 32:35.921
Do you want to talk, Kev?

32:35.954 --> 32:37.156
About today?

32:38.157 --> 32:40.326
It was just a story on TV.

32:40.359 --> 32:42.061
It wasn't real.

32:44.196 --> 32:46.365
(indistinct chatter on TV)

32:46.398 --> 32:48.334
Okay.

32:50.736 --> 32:52.571
(knocking)

32:55.907 --> 32:57.709
-Oh, yes.
-(chuckles)

32:57.743 --> 32:59.078
It has been a day.

32:59.111 --> 33:00.712
I could use a veg-out session

33:00.746 --> 33:01.947
on the world's
most comfortable...

33:03.982 --> 33:05.017
...comfortable couch.
I di...

33:05.051 --> 33:05.984
I'm s...
I didn't realize, uh...

33:06.018 --> 33:06.985
No, no, no.

33:07.019 --> 33:08.520
It's fine.

33:08.554 --> 33:10.689
-Twins are out cold, huh?
-Yeah.

33:10.722 --> 33:12.158
-How'd they do?
-They were good.

33:12.191 --> 33:13.959
-Aw.
-Yeah, they had a good time.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.727
You know, they're cracked out
on cake right now, but, um...

33:21.200 --> 33:23.369
You skipped ahead
to the next episode?

33:23.402 --> 33:24.736
Yeah.

33:24.770 --> 33:25.971
-We got sucked in.
-Huh.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.173
-Sorry.
-It's my fault.

33:27.206 --> 33:29.208
Maddy started me
at the beginning,

33:29.241 --> 33:32.378
but I got hooked,
and I made her keep going.

33:32.411 --> 33:34.746
Ah, it's, you know what,
it's fine, obviously.

33:34.780 --> 33:36.582
Not a big deal.

33:41.019 --> 33:41.987
God, it's super late.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.156
-Mm.
-I should go.

33:44.190 --> 33:45.324
Again, I really love that film.

33:45.357 --> 33:46.625
-It was so good.
-Thanks, man.

33:47.793 --> 33:49.428
Maddy.

33:49.461 --> 33:50.862
This was a lot of fun.

33:50.896 --> 33:52.698
It was.
I had a great time.

33:53.732 --> 33:55.401
Okay. Well, um...

33:57.236 --> 33:59.004
-Yeah. Night.
-Good night.

34:06.745 --> 34:08.580
Sorry, again. I didn't realize,
you know, that you were...

34:08.614 --> 34:11.049
No, no. We were just...

34:12.651 --> 34:14.520
Yeah, not to harp on this,
but I feel like,

34:14.553 --> 34:17.256
should we establish
which shows are gonna be ones

34:17.289 --> 34:18.857
that we watch together
and which ones are sort of

34:18.890 --> 34:19.858
go at your own pace?

34:19.891 --> 34:21.427
-Because I...
-Kevin.

34:24.230 --> 34:25.797
(sighs)

34:27.733 --> 34:29.935
Was a rough day.

34:31.937 --> 34:33.405
I got bad news about my mom.

34:33.439 --> 34:35.641
There's this scan and...

34:35.674 --> 34:37.176
plaque and...

34:38.577 --> 34:39.445
It's bad.

34:44.250 --> 34:46.652
God, I am, I am so sorry.

34:46.685 --> 34:49.355
Thank you. It's-it's...

34:52.858 --> 34:55.026
I don't like
that he calls you Maddy.

35:01.032 --> 35:03.769
You know, people said
I was crazy--

35:03.802 --> 35:07.306
me living in your garage
just to stay close to the twins.

35:07.339 --> 35:09.175
Yeah.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.111
It's possible they had a point.

35:13.145 --> 35:14.680
(sighs)

35:19.785 --> 35:21.353
(Rebecca sighs)

35:21.387 --> 35:23.955
Did we do that
even remotely right?

35:23.989 --> 35:25.857
I don't know.

35:25.891 --> 35:28.527
(chuckles): My first time.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.496
Mine, too.

35:30.529 --> 35:32.164
(clicks tongue)

35:32.198 --> 35:33.965
I knew I should've married
someone how already had kids.

35:33.999 --> 35:35.634
(both chuckle)

35:37.403 --> 35:39.838
(takes deep breath)

35:40.872 --> 35:42.341
-Jack.
-Hmm?

35:43.842 --> 35:45.977
I'm worried about Kevin.

35:46.011 --> 35:47.145
Will you please
tell me something

35:47.179 --> 35:48.847
to make me feel better?

35:50.349 --> 35:53.285
Well, he... he gets it.

35:53.319 --> 35:56.322
His brain's just...

35:56.355 --> 35:57.523
protecting itself.

35:59.691 --> 36:02.894
Yeah, that kid, he's gonna grow
up faster than we can handle.

36:02.928 --> 36:06.532
One day...

36:06.565 --> 36:09.568
he's gonna have it
all figured out.

36:09.601 --> 36:12.170
I mean, hell, it's not like
he's gonna wind up

36:12.204 --> 36:14.573
some 40-year-old man

36:14.606 --> 36:17.142
who can't stop talking about
the Challenger explosion.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.777
-Right?
-Right.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.847
(sighs):
Okay.

36:25.050 --> 36:27.018
*

36:27.052 --> 36:29.321
-Randall.
-(chuckles)

36:29.355 --> 36:31.957
Randall is too good.

36:33.259 --> 36:34.593
Too good how?

36:34.626 --> 36:36.695
I don't know, for the world.

36:40.065 --> 36:41.967
Did you ever read
Catcher in the Rye?

36:43.235 --> 36:44.403
Yeah, of course.

36:47.072 --> 36:47.973
No.

36:49.641 --> 36:52.043
Okay, so it's about this kid,

36:52.077 --> 36:55.180
this-this teenager named Holden.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.948
And he's depressed.

36:56.982 --> 36:58.917
-Well, his name is Holden.
-Stop.

36:58.950 --> 37:00.218
(exhales)

37:00.252 --> 37:02.187
And he...

37:02.220 --> 37:05.190
wants to protect
all of the innocent people,

37:05.223 --> 37:08.059
all of the children, and...

37:08.093 --> 37:10.529
he has to accept the fact
that he can't.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.331
*

37:14.733 --> 37:17.836
And I think that Randall might
be the Catcher in the Rye, Jack.

37:20.572 --> 37:23.141
I think he might...
he might spend his whole life

37:23.174 --> 37:26.945
trying to save everyone,
and he won't be able to.

37:28.179 --> 37:32.551
I just worry that his life
will be this beautiful but...

37:32.584 --> 37:36.688
perpetually disappointing ride.

37:39.625 --> 37:42.260
(scoffs)

37:42.294 --> 37:44.095
What a thing.

37:45.331 --> 37:46.498
Being a parent.

37:49.167 --> 37:51.470
What a thing being a kid.

37:51.503 --> 37:53.171
(softly):
Yeah.

37:55.941 --> 37:57.275
-Hey.
-KEVIN: Hey.

37:57.309 --> 37:59.210
-I know you like extra.
-Thanks.

38:05.717 --> 38:08.920
You know, when we were
growing up,

38:08.954 --> 38:10.689
if we needed something,
Mom and Dad--

38:10.722 --> 38:13.792
they were just...
they were a bedroom away.

38:13.825 --> 38:15.361
Yeah, and, uh...

38:17.663 --> 38:19.130
My kids aren't gonna have that.

38:21.199 --> 38:23.502
They'll have
something different.

38:23.535 --> 38:24.936
Okay? And it will be normal
to them,

38:24.970 --> 38:26.505
and it will be wonderful.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.311
I'm taking the Manny reboot.

38:33.345 --> 38:36.548
Stay here in L.A.,
give the kids some stability.

38:36.582 --> 38:38.216
-Really?
-Yeah.

38:40.552 --> 38:43.622
Yeah, I mean, it's...
it's TV, right?

38:43.655 --> 38:46.224
I mean, none of that stuff
is real. It's...

38:50.195 --> 38:52.398
Mom's really sick, Kate.

38:55.401 --> 38:57.202
This is really happening.

38:58.404 --> 39:00.171
Yeah.

39:01.373 --> 39:04.042
-Yeah.
-Just feels like the...

39:06.044 --> 39:08.146
...like the world should
just stop for Mom, you know?

39:08.179 --> 39:10.048
Just...

39:12.718 --> 39:15.020
Yeah, the world
should stop for Mom.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.590
And, uh...

39:18.624 --> 39:20.592
I find it so infuriating
that this is happening to us

39:20.626 --> 39:22.193
while the rest of the world,
they just-they just continue

39:22.227 --> 39:24.863
to go round and round
like it's...

39:32.738 --> 39:35.073
Kev, do you remember
where we were five years ago?

39:36.875 --> 39:38.276
Five years ago to the day,

39:38.309 --> 39:39.745
we were sitting
on my bathroom floor

39:39.778 --> 39:42.047
because I'd just face-planted
off a scale.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.282
(takes deep breath)

39:44.315 --> 39:47.853
And you were about to implode
your life and career

39:47.886 --> 39:49.254
on national television

39:50.456 --> 39:52.090
(scoffs)

39:52.123 --> 39:55.694
And it was such a low moment.

39:55.727 --> 39:58.029
You know, it just felt like
every door was shutting on us

39:58.063 --> 40:00.065
and shutting out
all of the light,

40:00.098 --> 40:02.167
just like after dad.

40:05.671 --> 40:08.073
But...

40:08.106 --> 40:10.075
look at us now.

40:11.643 --> 40:13.979
We-we each have two healthy,
beautiful kids.

40:14.012 --> 40:16.615
Careers we never imagined.

40:18.617 --> 40:20.251
If the world stopped
for the bad stuff,

40:20.285 --> 40:23.755
then-then everything
would be dark.

40:23.789 --> 40:26.992
But the world keeps going, so
we can find that crack of light

40:27.025 --> 40:29.060
on the other side of the door.

40:29.094 --> 40:30.862
You know?

40:34.365 --> 40:36.968
We have found the light before,

40:37.002 --> 40:39.605
big brother.

40:39.638 --> 40:41.439
And we'll find it again.

40:42.641 --> 40:44.610

40:57.355 --> 41:01.426
Well, looks like another
sad night for old Nicky.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.529
Just staring at Facebook,

41:03.562 --> 41:05.797
looking for someone
who doesn't even know I exist.

41:05.831 --> 41:08.600
-Just...
-Stop, Nicky!

41:08.634 --> 41:11.002
Life is too short.

41:11.036 --> 41:13.539
It is far shorter
than it has any right to be,

41:13.572 --> 41:15.941
and you are giving me
a frigging headache.

41:15.974 --> 41:18.510
You want to go see Sally?
Let's go see Sally.

41:18.544 --> 41:20.646
Pack a bag.
We'll leave in the morning.

41:20.679 --> 41:24.315
-Bec...
-Honey, life is too short,

41:24.349 --> 41:26.518
and the man is giving me
a frigging headache.

I'm old.

I have three parents gone.

41:57.382 --> 41:59.250
One's sick.

41:59.284 --> 42:03.221
It's not even
unusual at my age.

What?

You didn't have to.

I know.
