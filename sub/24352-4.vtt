I didn't start playing
with these

05:41.130 --> 05:42.670

Okay.

05:42.670 --> 05:46.430
So where did you get this idea,
at 30, to play with blocks?

05:46.430 --> 05:49.230
- Well, I was, uh,
at home, playing around

05:49.230 --> 05:50.870
with different magic ideas.

05:50.870 --> 05:52.900
And I set up a camera,
and I started playing

05:52.900 --> 05:54.130
with this trick.

05:54.130 --> 05:56.030
And, like, I was like,
"Oh, this is like--

05:56.030 --> 05:58.600
maybe something."
But, uh, I put it up

05:58.600 --> 06:00.700
on YouTube, and, like,
it got some views.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.430
I mean, not, like,
a crazy amount of views,

06:02.430 --> 06:04.970
but people seemed
to respond to it.

06:04.970 --> 06:07.330
And so it kind of
got me thinking, like,

06:07.330 --> 06:08.900
"Oh, maybe I should
develop this

06:08.900 --> 06:11.770
into a actual trick."
So it took three years

06:11.770 --> 06:14.800
for me to take it
from the floor of my apartment

obviously very gifted
and smart magicians.

06:24.030 --> 06:27.730
But maybe they haven't
seen anything like this before,

06:27.730 --> 06:30.430
since it's from
my crazy mind, so...

06:30.430 --> 06:31.630
- Yeah.
- You know.

06:31.630 --> 06:33.500
It's uh--
we'll have to see.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.170

All right, well,

with these guys, shall we?

06:37.670 --> 06:39.200
Penn? Teller?

06:39.200 --> 06:40.630
- Uh...

06:40.630 --> 06:43.570
One of the rarer things
than fooling us

06:43.570 --> 06:45.300
is showing us something
that we haven't

06:45.300 --> 06:47.270
seen anything like.

06:47.270 --> 06:49.400
This doesn't look like
any magic trick, uh,

06:49.400 --> 06:50.570
we've ever seen before.

06:50.570 --> 06:51.930
Uh, it doesn't look
like you got it

06:51.930 --> 06:53.700
in a magic shop,
and you didn't.

06:53.700 --> 06:56.300
Uh, this really looks
like something different.

06:56.300 --> 06:58.400
Also the effect,
and the whole way

06:58.400 --> 07:00.370
it's laid out
is very different

07:00.370 --> 07:01.770
than anything that we've seen.
It really is--

07:01.770 --> 07:03.330
It really is new, original.

07:03.330 --> 07:06.030
And your presentation
did not have a lot of jive

07:06.030 --> 07:07.300
and garbage.

07:07.300 --> 07:11.430
Just simple, straightforward,
sweet, and beautiful.

07:11.430 --> 07:14.900
And, um, we don't know
if we know how this is done.

07:14.900 --> 07:16.670
We really don't.
We've got--

07:16.670 --> 07:20.870
We know very few ways
to do, uh, levitations.

07:20.870 --> 07:23.230
There are just very few ways
that we know of.

07:23.230 --> 07:25.070
And, uh, the first thing
you might think of

07:25.070 --> 07:28.100
is some sort of, um, uh--
to make 'em float.

07:28.100 --> 07:29.900
You'd think about magnets,
but magnet stuff

07:29.900 --> 07:31.870
has to be spinning,
you know?

07:31.870 --> 07:34.000
We'd also think that maybe
it was attached to you,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.500
but it would be wiggling
in some way, you know?

07:36.500 --> 07:39.200
This was really secured,
really steady.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.970
And, um,
the one kind of, um,

07:41.970 --> 07:44.770
thread of an idea we had
was that, uh--

07:44.770 --> 07:47.000
was that the theater
is so well lit.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.430
You know, it's so well lit;
there's 50,000 watts of power

07:50.430 --> 07:52.530
going faster miles an hour,
and you have

07:52.530 --> 07:54.430
those two little desk lamps.

07:54.430 --> 07:56.530
And that gave us
a little bit of a hint.

07:56.530 --> 07:58.970
And if you have some idea
of what we're talking about,

07:58.970 --> 08:00.570
then you didn't fool us.

08:00.570 --> 08:02.230
And if you don't have some idea
of what we're talking about,

08:02.230 --> 08:04.170
then you did fool us,
and we are thrilled

08:04.170 --> 08:06.700
to little pieces
because we love this act,

08:06.700 --> 08:08.500
whether it fooled us or not.

08:08.500 --> 08:11.000
- Do--
- I believe--

08:11.000 --> 08:14.100
I did try, maybe,
what you're suggesting,

08:14.100 --> 08:16.270
and it didn't work for me.

08:16.270 --> 08:19.200

with something else.

what they said.

10:14.330 --> 10:16.730
[cheers and applause]

10:16.730 --> 10:19.670
- Please welcome back
to the "Fool Us" stage,

10:19.670 --> 10:21.800
Kostya Kimlat!

10:21.800 --> 10:24.930
[cheers and applause]

10:24.930 --> 10:26.330
- Thank you!

10:26.330 --> 10:28.530
Thank you very much!
Thank you, Penn and Teller!

10:28.530 --> 10:31.000
Wow, it's amazing
to be back here in Vegas.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.200
Alyson, I'd love it
if you'd come

10:32.200 --> 10:33.830
join me over here.
- Sure.

10:33.830 --> 10:35.370
- I'm so happy
that you're here.

10:35.370 --> 10:37.370
- Aww, I'm happy you're here!
- I have to tell you

10:37.370 --> 10:38.900
that performing for these guys

10:38.900 --> 10:41.130
is one of the hardest things
that a magician can do.

10:41.130 --> 10:42.800
- Or me. Yeah.
- That's true!

10:42.800 --> 10:44.670
- No, no, if I was
doing magic for you,

10:44.670 --> 10:46.030
or for anyone else
in the theater,

10:46.030 --> 10:47.800
there would be no stress.
- Yeah.

10:47.800 --> 10:48.800
- I'll show you, look.
I'm gonna have you

10:48.800 --> 10:49.870
pick a card.
- Okay.

10:49.870 --> 10:51.430
- Anytime you like,
just say "stop."

10:51.430 --> 10:53.100
- Stop.
- Remember that card, okay?

10:53.100 --> 10:54.430
- Yes.
- You've got it?

10:54.430 --> 10:55.570
- Yes.
- Okay, because I don't know

10:55.570 --> 10:56.770
what it is.
- Okay.

10:56.770 --> 10:58.130
- But the moment
that you say it out loud,

10:58.130 --> 11:00.330
your card will fly
out of the deck,

11:00.330 --> 11:02.430
and I will catch it
at my fingertips.

11:02.430 --> 11:03.630
- Okay.
- It'll happen

11:03.630 --> 11:04.900
in just a blink of an eye.
Are you ready?

11:04.900 --> 11:06.530
- Yes.
- Alyson, name your card.

11:06.530 --> 11:08.570
- Six of clubs.

11:08.570 --> 11:10.770
- Wow!
- The six of clubs.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.500
Pretty cool, right?
- Really cool!

11:12.500 --> 11:13.870
- Yeah!
- Amazing!

11:13.870 --> 11:15.130
- That's what I mean, right?

11:15.130 --> 11:16.500
You're impressed,
you're amazed--

11:16.500 --> 11:17.730
- Yeah.
- I'm having fun.

11:17.730 --> 11:19.130
This is what it's about!
But these guys, look.

11:19.130 --> 11:21.200
They're not fooled, right?
- Aww.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.670
- They know exactly
how my fingers

11:22.670 --> 11:23.970
manipulated the cards.

11:23.970 --> 11:25.070
They know where it was,

11:25.070 --> 11:26.300
they know how it flew
out of the deck.

11:26.300 --> 11:28.900
If I'm gonna fool these guys
with the same trick,

11:28.900 --> 11:30.970
I have to do more
than just sleight of hand.

11:30.970 --> 11:32.530
I have to be clever.
- Oh.

11:32.530 --> 11:34.330
- I have to be sneaky.
- Mm.

11:34.330 --> 11:36.200
- I might even have to lie
just a little.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.200
- [gasps]
- Yeah!

11:37.200 --> 11:38.400
- Shocking.
- I know!

11:38.400 --> 11:40.070
- So I-I'm gonna do
the same trick for them.

11:40.070 --> 11:42.030
But Penn, you remember
what happened last time

11:42.030 --> 11:43.200
I was here?
- I do.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.470
- Yeah, he picked up a chair,
he--he--

11:44.470 --> 11:46.600
- I know, I don't think
I can protect you very well.

11:46.600 --> 11:47.700
- No, I need you here
as my bodyguard, please.

11:47.700 --> 11:48.970
- Uh...
- Teller just sat there

11:48.970 --> 11:50.130
giggling last time.
Did nothing!

11:50.130 --> 11:51.630
- [laughing]
- So how about this?

11:51.630 --> 11:52.770
You're gonna stick with me,
at least

11:52.770 --> 11:54.130
as my emotional support.
- Yes.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.370
- And I'd love it
if the gentlemen

11:55.370 --> 11:56.800
could join us up here.
Everyone, please welcome

11:56.800 --> 11:58.300
Penn and Teller to the stage!
- Whoo!

11:58.300 --> 12:00.970
- Alyson, come on over!

12:00.970 --> 12:03.030
Good to see you, sir.

12:03.030 --> 12:04.600
Wonderful to see you!
- Oh, you rat bastard.

12:04.600 --> 12:05.830
[laughing]
- Oh, great to see you!

12:05.830 --> 12:06.830
Great to see you!

12:06.830 --> 12:08.670
So, let's get comfortable.

12:08.670 --> 12:10.500
Gentlemen, I'm going to perform
the same trick for you

12:10.500 --> 12:11.770
as I just did for Alyson.

12:11.770 --> 12:13.000
I'm going to have you
pick a card,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.070
and then I will catch it
at my fingertips.

12:15.070 --> 12:16.830
But I have to use
a different method.

12:16.830 --> 12:18.470
And I know that the moment
I tell you that,

12:18.470 --> 12:20.830
your brains start thinking
of all the possible ways

12:20.830 --> 12:22.070
I could do this.

12:22.070 --> 12:24.570
So, right now,
Teller is burning my hands.

12:24.570 --> 12:26.330
That means he's watching
my every move.

12:26.330 --> 12:28.400
He's making sure
that I don't switch

12:28.400 --> 12:30.230
this deck of cards
for a different one,

12:30.230 --> 12:31.970
one with all the same cards.

12:31.970 --> 12:34.370
Penn, meanwhile,
he's burning the cards.

12:34.370 --> 12:36.270
He's looking at the corners
to make sure

12:36.270 --> 12:38.000
that I haven't
cut any of them

12:38.000 --> 12:39.970
to make them easier
to get to.

12:39.970 --> 12:41.900
Or, maybe I filed down
the edges

12:41.900 --> 12:45.030
in order to make one card
stand out from the others.

12:45.030 --> 12:47.200
Maybe--
Maybe I used glue,

12:47.200 --> 12:49.700
on the edges of my fingers
in order to make it easier

12:49.700 --> 12:50.900
to catch that card.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.300
That would be clever.

12:52.300 --> 12:53.670
Or better yet,

12:53.670 --> 12:56.470
I have magnets in my fingertips
that allow me

12:56.470 --> 12:58.400
to capture that card.
- Oh!

12:58.400 --> 13:00.300
- Yeah, maybe I do!
Maybe I do!

13:00.300 --> 13:01.600
Maybe I don't.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.130
That's not for me to say.

13:03.130 --> 13:06.630
So, all of these possibilities
are there for you to consider.

13:06.630 --> 13:07.970
Maybe I'm telling you
the truth,

13:07.970 --> 13:10.000
and maybe I'm not.
[audience laughter]

13:10.000 --> 13:11.270
Now, I know
that doesn't seem fair,

13:11.270 --> 13:13.300
but, hey,
you guys started this game.

13:13.300 --> 13:15.630
- [chuckles]
[audience laughter]

13:15.630 --> 13:19.270
- So here's
what I'm going to do.

13:19.270 --> 13:21.230
I'm going
to shuffle these cards,

13:21.230 --> 13:22.670
but I won't push them in
all the way,

13:22.670 --> 13:24.270
leaving some of these cards
isolated

13:24.270 --> 13:25.670
and out of my control.

13:25.670 --> 13:27.530
I'm also going
to riffle slowly,

13:27.530 --> 13:29.870
so Penn knows I'm not
influencing his choice

13:29.870 --> 13:32.100
with Jedi mind tricks.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.730
Penn, please say "stop."

13:33.730 --> 13:35.470
- Stop.
- Are you happy there?

13:35.470 --> 13:36.630
- One more.
- One more?

13:36.630 --> 13:37.870
How's that?
- Good.

13:37.870 --> 13:39.200
- Teller, you feeling good
about all this?

13:39.200 --> 13:41.070
Sure, why not, right?
Now, very important:

13:41.070 --> 13:42.530
Before we go any further,

13:42.530 --> 13:43.730
I want you to make sure
that your card

13:43.730 --> 13:45.300
is not near the top,
or near the bottom.

13:45.300 --> 13:46.570
That it's somewhere
within the spread.

13:46.570 --> 13:47.800
And Alyson, you can--
I'm sorry,

13:47.800 --> 13:49.530
you didn't see the card.
- No.

13:49.530 --> 13:50.930
- Now you know how I feel.
- Yeah!

13:50.930 --> 13:52.230
- [chuckles]
- Yeah!

13:52.230 --> 13:53.770
- So are--are you satisfied?

13:53.770 --> 13:56.300
It's in the spread, very good.

13:56.300 --> 13:58.930
Now, at this moment in time,
there are multiple realities

13:58.930 --> 13:59.970
happening here onstage.

13:59.970 --> 14:01.300
See, Penn and Teller,

14:01.300 --> 14:02.600
they're focused
on the method of the trick,

14:02.600 --> 14:04.670
and trying to figure out
what I lied to them about.

14:04.670 --> 14:07.300
But you and the audience,
you don't care about method,

14:07.300 --> 14:09.130
so you get
to experience the effect.

14:09.130 --> 14:10.270
- Yeah!
- Look at the joy

14:10.270 --> 14:11.730
on her face, right?
- Yeah, uh-huh.

14:11.730 --> 14:14.600
Now, whereas for you
the card shot out of the deck

14:14.600 --> 14:16.170
and I caught it
at my fingertips,

14:16.170 --> 14:18.770
for you gentlemen,
my fingers are going to shoot

14:18.770 --> 14:19.930
into the deck,

14:19.930 --> 14:22.170
and I will capture your card.

14:22.170 --> 14:23.770
[sighs]

14:33.000 --> 14:34.170
Penn, what was your card?

14:34.170 --> 14:36.600
- King of spades.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.170
- Your card.

14:38.170 --> 14:41.800
The king of spades.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.130
[cheers and applause]

14:44.130 --> 14:46.870
Thank you very much,
gentlemen!

14:46.870 --> 14:48.100
Thank you very much!

14:48.100 --> 14:49.930
- Kostya Kimlat!

14:49.930 --> 14:53.170
[cheers and applause]

14:53.170 --> 14:55.500
- I can understand
why he wanted to hit you.

14:55.500 --> 14:56.800
- [laughing] Yes!
- Yeah.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.800
That was incredible!
- Thank you so much.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.170
I'm--it's so frustrating
to not, like,

15:01.170 --> 15:02.830
know how you did that.
- Yeah, well,

15:02.830 --> 15:04.130
it's part of the magic,
part of the beauty of it.

15:04.130 --> 15:06.170
Mm-hmm.
- So, am I correct in thinking

15:06.170 --> 15:08.300
you've worked on that trick
for 17 years?

15:08.300 --> 15:10.270
- Yes, I've been practicing it
for 17 years.

15:10.270 --> 15:11.570
- Wow!
- Yes.

15:11.570 --> 15:13.530
- What was it at 17 years
you were like,

15:13.530 --> 15:15.500
"Yep, it's ready."
- You know, I just--

15:15.500 --> 15:17.170
No, I just had no life.
I always played with cards.

15:17.170 --> 15:19.430
I always went with my hand.
I'm always practicing.

15:19.430 --> 15:21.200
I created it to fool magicians.
- Yeah.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.430
- But I showed it
kind of underground,

15:22.430 --> 15:23.770
didn't show it
to too many people.

15:23.770 --> 15:25.330
And for three years now,
I've been thinking

15:25.330 --> 15:27.400
what I can do to come back.

15:27.400 --> 15:28.800
And I thought, "This is it."
- This is it.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.230
- Yeah!
- Oh!

15:30.230 --> 15:32.370
Was it nerve-racking coming
back for the second time?

15:32.370 --> 15:33.630
- I've been really
looking forward to it.

15:33.630 --> 15:34.900
I've been looking forward
to seeing their faces,

15:34.900 --> 15:36.670
and spending time with them
onstage here.

15:36.670 --> 15:38.630
So this has been the moment
that I'm really excited about.

15:38.630 --> 15:40.170
- And how has your life changed

15:40.170 --> 15:42.170
since you were on
the first time?

15:42.170 --> 15:43.670
- You know, the first time
I was on "Fool Us"--

15:43.670 --> 15:45.000
before then, no one knew
who I was,

15:45.000 --> 15:46.970
and didn't know I was coming,
but ever since then,

15:46.970 --> 15:48.630
it's changed my life,
because now people know,

15:48.630 --> 15:50.430
"Oh, you're the guy
that fooled Penn and Teller!

15:50.430 --> 15:52.600
Let's hire you!"
- Um...

15:52.600 --> 15:54.230
Okay, I...
- [nervous sigh]

15:54.230 --> 15:56.270
- I don't know,
I see some surprised looks.

15:56.270 --> 15:58.030
Let's talk to the boys.

15:58.030 --> 16:00.130
- 'Kay.
- Gentlemen.

16:00.130 --> 16:03.500
- I want you to think
about this, because, um...

16:03.500 --> 16:06.830
if we do this bust on you,

16:06.830 --> 16:08.630
and if we're wrong,

16:08.630 --> 16:11.430
and if you fooled us again,

16:11.430 --> 16:13.400
I'm going to hurt you.

16:13.400 --> 16:14.730
[laughter]

16:14.730 --> 16:17.330
So, that kind--you know
that little thing you did

16:17.330 --> 16:18.670
with the glue stick,
and you did

16:18.670 --> 16:20.930
the little scissors,
you did this, you did that.

16:20.930 --> 16:22.970
I'm telling you,
we have a little list.

16:22.970 --> 16:25.330
I'll hit you in the head.
- [laughing]

16:25.330 --> 16:27.270
- I'll kick you in the ass.

16:27.270 --> 16:29.630
I'll knock you down.
I'll trip you.

16:29.630 --> 16:31.430
Imagine those are laid out
in front of you

16:31.430 --> 16:32.600
as I say this.
[Alyson laughing]

16:32.600 --> 16:34.230
Here's the problem.
- Okay.

16:34.230 --> 16:35.930
- You know,
we've hung out with you.

16:35.930 --> 16:38.830
In hotel rooms, with you
doing this stuff for us.

16:38.830 --> 16:40.300
Amazing stuff.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.630
And there's a--
kind of a shortcut

16:42.630 --> 16:46.670
Teller and I use talking about
juggling and magic.

16:46.670 --> 16:49.330
Because juggling, you say
you're gonna do something

16:49.330 --> 16:50.630
and you do it.

16:50.630 --> 16:52.700
And in magic, you say
you're gonna do something

16:52.700 --> 16:54.130
and you don't.

16:54.130 --> 16:55.730
We think--

16:55.730 --> 16:57.670
we know you can control
a card anywhere.

16:57.670 --> 16:59.170
We know once
I've picked a card,

16:59.170 --> 17:00.830
you can put it
wherever you want.

17:00.830 --> 17:03.630
We know you could put
that card where you want.

17:03.630 --> 17:05.670
We kinda-sorta
watched you do it.

17:05.670 --> 17:10.369
And then, and this is
the weirdest bust we've done,

17:10.369 --> 17:12.869
we think you actually did it.

17:12.869 --> 17:14.900
We don't think
there was a trick.

17:14.900 --> 17:17.470
We think you knew
the location of the card,

17:17.470 --> 17:19.630
and you've been practicing
since you were 18,

17:19.630 --> 17:22.470
'cause you reached in
and grabbed the [bleep] thing.

17:22.470 --> 17:23.470
[laughter]

17:23.470 --> 17:26.130
We think you actually did

17:26.130 --> 17:28.470
what you said
you were going to do,

17:28.470 --> 17:31.430
and therefore,
although you blew our minds

17:31.430 --> 17:33.270
and amazed us,

17:33.270 --> 17:34.730
you did not fool us.

17:34.730 --> 17:38.170
We think you are that
[bleep] good.

17:38.170 --> 17:39.270
[laughter]

17:39.270 --> 17:41.530
So go ahead, tell me
you're not that good.

17:41.530 --> 17:43.130
- So you think
that I've been locked up

17:43.130 --> 17:45.500
for 20 years practicing,
and that I could...

17:45.500 --> 17:48.730
precision dribble
and catch any card that I want

17:48.730 --> 17:50.600
from anywhere in the deck?
- Uh...

17:50.600 --> 17:52.270
Kinda-sorta-ish, yeah.

17:52.270 --> 17:53.870
[laughter]

17:53.870 --> 17:55.230
- You're 100% right.

17:55.230 --> 17:56.630
- Wow!

17:56.630 --> 17:59.270
[cheers and applause]

17:59.270 --> 18:01.530
- Thank you so much.
- You're so good, baby.

18:01.530 --> 18:03.570
You're so good.
- Thank you so much.

18:03.570 --> 18:05.000
Thank you,
you guys are the best.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.230
- Aww!
- So good!

18:06.230 --> 18:07.700
- Thank you, guys.
- That was incredible!

18:07.700 --> 18:10.770
- He's better than you think,
I'm telling you that.

18:10.770 --> 18:12.700
- Kostya Kimlat!

18:12.700 --> 18:14.170
- Thank you very much!

18:14.170 --> 18:16.870
Thank you, guys!
Thank you!

18:16.870 --> 18:19.130
- More magic coming up,
including something

18:19.130 --> 18:21.800
from entertainment's
greatest duo:

18:21.800 --> 18:23.700
Penn and Teller!

18:39.030 --> 18:41.370
We've seen one fooler
so far tonight.

18:41.370 --> 18:44.470
Let's go for two,
as we meet our next magician.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.530
- I am from Sweden.

18:47.530 --> 18:48.530
I am a magician,

18:48.530 --> 18:50.270
comedian, and singer.

18:50.270 --> 18:52.900
<i>When I was a kid,
if they would say go left,</i>

18:52.900 --> 18:54.400
<i>I would go right.</i>

18:54.400 --> 18:57.870
You know we have the phrasing,
"color outside the lines"?

18:57.870 --> 18:59.570
<i>Yeah, I was that kid.</i>

18:59.570 --> 19:01.330
<i>I grew up
in a little small village.</i>

19:01.330 --> 19:04.200
<i>We had only one gas station
and one store.</i>

19:04.200 --> 19:06.500
Nobody knew anything
about magic.

19:06.500 --> 19:10.370
<i>I actually found a magic book
in our bookshelf at home.</i>

19:10.370 --> 19:14.570
<i>I read that book so hard,
it fell apart.</i>

19:14.570 --> 19:16.470
<i>Today, I travel
all around the world</i>

19:16.470 --> 19:19.570
<i>and doing my magic
and comedy and music.</i>

19:19.570 --> 19:23.500
<i>If you are a comedy magician
and your jokes doesn't work,</i>

19:23.500 --> 19:26.100
<i>you really have to have
good magic.</i>

19:26.100 --> 19:30.370
<i>And if I fail in both,
I can sing a song.</i>

19:30.370 --> 19:33.930

19:33.930 --> 19:39.070

- Wow!

22:10.870 --> 22:12.200
- Hello.
- Hello!

22:12.200 --> 22:14.430
- Hello, Alyson.
- If magic doesn't work out,

22:14.430 --> 22:16.600
you could just be a singer!
- Exactly!

22:16.600 --> 22:18.200
- But I think magic's
working out.

22:18.200 --> 22:19.670
- Yeah, thank you.
- Yes.

22:19.670 --> 22:21.300
- I came all the way
from Sweden

22:21.300 --> 22:23.170
to do this, you know.
- That's fantastic.

22:23.170 --> 22:25.230
- It's a far, far away--
I went through Norway,

22:25.230 --> 22:27.030
and I took a boat to Denmark.

22:27.030 --> 22:29.430
Then a train to Spain
and, you know, everything.

22:29.430 --> 22:30.830
- Yeah.
- Some--

22:30.830 --> 22:33.200
- I'm pretty sure you could
have just flown direct.

22:33.200 --> 22:34.830
- What?
- Uh...

22:34.830 --> 22:36.670
Nothing, nothing.
[laughter]

22:36.670 --> 22:39.300
Is there a lot of, uh,
magic in Sweden?

22:39.300 --> 22:42.270
- I would say we have a few
good magicians in Sweden.

22:42.270 --> 22:43.670
But where I grew up--
I grew up

22:43.670 --> 22:46.400
in a little, little town.
Uh, not even a town,

22:46.400 --> 22:47.630
it was a village.

22:47.630 --> 22:50.530
And there were no one
in the, uh,

22:50.530 --> 22:52.000
entertainment industry.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.030
My father was a--a sailor.

22:54.030 --> 22:55.730
My mother was a caretaker.

22:55.730 --> 22:57.970
And I like this--
the thing that you--

22:57.970 --> 22:59.600
if you can dream it,
you can do it.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.530
- Mm-hmm, definitely.
- That's my thing.

23:01.530 --> 23:03.600
- And did you dream this?
- I--

23:03.600 --> 23:07.470
No, actually, I did not
dream this big from the start.

23:07.470 --> 23:09.730
But you know,
it goes up and up.

23:09.730 --> 23:11.970
As you reach your dreams,
you put them higher.

23:11.970 --> 23:13.300
- Well, let's see
if Penn and Teller

23:13.300 --> 23:14.970
are ready for you.
- Oh.

23:14.970 --> 23:16.730
I am so pleased with you.

23:16.730 --> 23:20.370
'Cause Teller and I
so rarely agree.

23:20.370 --> 23:24.070
But I turned to Teller
when you finished,

23:24.070 --> 23:26.800
and I said something to Teller,
and he agreed,

23:26.800 --> 23:30.300
instantly, with no hesitation
whatsoever.

23:30.300 --> 23:34.300
I turned to Teller and said,
"That is one weird-ass act."

23:34.300 --> 23:36.130
[laughter]

23:36.130 --> 23:37.600
And Teller--
- Oh!

23:37.600 --> 23:39.030
- "Yes!"
- And that's

23:39.030 --> 23:41.530
the best compliment I will get.
- And I also love you

23:41.530 --> 23:44.130
because there's something
that was said first

23:44.130 --> 23:47.170
by Mac King, and that is,
"On 'Fool Us,'

23:47.170 --> 23:50.200
if you fool Teller,
you fool Penn and Teller."

23:50.200 --> 23:51.470
I'm considered
to be nothing more

23:51.470 --> 23:53.430
than the chirp,
just the mouthpiece,

23:53.430 --> 23:54.770
just the one that talks.

23:54.770 --> 23:57.030
But I'll tell you, this time,
you fooled Teller.

23:57.030 --> 23:58.200
[stunned silence]

23:58.200 --> 23:59.730
- So I've--
- 'Cause Teller thought

23:59.730 --> 24:02.370
you were using a reel,
and you're not.

24:02.370 --> 24:04.370
And I told him,
"No, you're not."

24:04.370 --> 24:06.400
I said, "He doesn't need
to use a reel.

24:06.400 --> 24:08.970
Not with his personality.
Not with that personality."

24:08.970 --> 24:10.800
He's got
a magnetic personality.

24:10.800 --> 24:12.400
He can sell anything.
You know,

24:12.400 --> 24:14.500
some people come onstage,
they're not really that good.

24:14.500 --> 24:15.900
But you were not
a stiff at all.

24:15.900 --> 24:18.630
You were absolutely right there
all the way through.

24:18.630 --> 24:20.670
I loved every moment
of what you did,

24:20.670 --> 24:23.430
and Teller and I agree
that when it came to the bullet

24:23.430 --> 24:25.500
hitting the bone,
I beat him.

24:25.500 --> 24:28.300
I whooped him.
I knew, he didn't.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.400
You're great,
but I think--

24:30.400 --> 24:32.930
I think you might not
have fooled me.

24:32.930 --> 24:34.700
- Mm-hmm.
- [stammers]

24:34.700 --> 24:38.230
So did you fool Teller,
but not Penn?

24:38.230 --> 24:40.470
- Uh, I don't really know.

24:40.470 --> 24:42.630
But, uh, I--
- [laughs]

24:42.630 --> 24:44.900
- I don't really know,
so uh--

24:44.900 --> 24:46.870
- Boy, the only way
I can think

24:46.870 --> 24:49.170
of doing this in code
is to make a joke.

24:49.170 --> 24:52.730
Uh, when I know something
that Teller doesn't know,

24:52.730 --> 24:54.970
it makes me stiff.
- Okay.

24:54.970 --> 24:57.430
Yeah, exactly.
[Penn laughing]

24:57.430 --> 24:59.070
Yeah.
- Okay!

24:59.070 --> 25:02.470
So they must have gotten it.
- Keep taking those pills.

25:02.470 --> 25:04.500
- I will!
- All right!

25:04.500 --> 25:05.770
Ladies and gentlemen...
- Thank you!

25:05.770 --> 25:07.200
- Hakan Berg!

25:07.200 --> 25:10.700

25:12.400 --> 25:15.330

to "Penn & Teller: Fool Us,"

25:37.000 --> 25:39.230
where it's always magic hour!

25:39.230 --> 25:41.230
Time to meet
our next magician.

25:43.270 --> 25:45.700
- Magic, to me,
is an opportunity

25:45.700 --> 25:46.970
for relationships.

25:46.970 --> 25:48.170
<i>You know,
even how I start my show,</i>

25:48.170 --> 25:49.670
<i>I come out and sing,
"Hey, friends!"</i>

25:49.670 --> 25:50.900
That's what I care about!

25:50.900 --> 25:52.530
<i>With close-up magic,
I can perform</i>

25:52.530 --> 25:57.000
at an upscale dinner party
to a stage with over 10,000.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.570
<i>You know, I love having
the camera onstage,</i>

25:59.570 --> 26:01.930
<i>so that everyone feels like
they're onstage with me.</i>

26:01.930 --> 26:03.500
<i>I get with my friends,</i>

26:03.500 --> 26:05.500
<i>and we call ourselves
"Sleight Club."</i>

26:05.500 --> 26:08.670
The first rule of Sleight Club
is "don't suck."

26:08.670 --> 26:12.370
<i>'Cause we wanna push magic
to be as good as possible.</i>

26:12.370 --> 26:14.600
So this trick
that I'm doing tonight,

26:14.600 --> 26:15.830
<i>we put our heads together
and thought,</i>

26:15.830 --> 26:17.470
<i>"Man, what is something
that has never</i>

26:17.470 --> 26:18.730
<i>been done before?"
And this is</i>

26:18.730 --> 26:19.730
what we came up with.

26:19.730 --> 26:21.700
And I think it's pretty cool.

26:21.700 --> 26:25.330
[cheers and applause]

26:25.330 --> 26:27.600
- Please welcome
my newest friend,

26:27.600 --> 26:29.770
John Michael Hinton!

26:29.770 --> 26:31.070
[audience cheering]

26:31.070 --> 26:34.430
- [happy sigh]

26:34.430 --> 26:38.830
4.59 seconds.

26:38.830 --> 26:42.900
Seriously, 4.59 seconds

26:42.900 --> 26:48.130
is the current world record
for solving a 3 by 3 cube.

26:48.130 --> 26:49.370
Think about that!

26:49.370 --> 26:51.570
Think about
how fast that is, right?

26:51.570 --> 26:54.470
How fast
you have to turn this thing.

26:54.470 --> 26:59.530
Or rather, how many turns
per second does it take?

26:59.530 --> 27:03.000
So I have been working on
how many turns I can get

27:03.000 --> 27:04.770
in just one second.

27:04.770 --> 27:06.170
Let me show you what I mean.

27:06.170 --> 27:08.330
That's one turn,
two turns,

27:08.330 --> 27:11.870
three, four, five, six,

31:15.700 --> 31:17.630
Uh, 'cause we all
sat down together

that we can do with a cube

31:21.230 --> 31:23.470

31:40.800 --> 31:42.000
These are really hard things.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.700
And those tricks are great.

31:43.700 --> 31:45.730
They use a basic principle
of magic,

31:45.730 --> 31:47.700
which is,
make something look

31:47.700 --> 31:49.900
like it's kind of
the same trick twice,

31:49.900 --> 31:52.030
and then do it
entirely different ways.

31:52.030 --> 31:53.670
- Yep.
- First one, uh,

31:53.670 --> 31:55.700
was like the Rubik's cube.

31:55.700 --> 31:57.100
Mathematical principles.

31:57.100 --> 32:00.200
And one of the things
that's often used in magic

32:00.200 --> 32:03.330
is that the human brain
cannot perceive "random."

32:03.330 --> 32:05.830
They don't know
what random and order is.

32:05.830 --> 32:08.630
You can tell them one thing
and it's actually another.

32:08.630 --> 32:10.300
Both ways, that goes.

32:10.300 --> 32:12.770
It's used a lot in card tricks,
that idea

32:12.770 --> 32:14.530
that something
that appears random--

32:14.530 --> 32:16.830
with Pharaohs and so on--
really isn't.

32:16.830 --> 32:18.700

and the second one
