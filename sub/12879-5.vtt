Morgan said guys like
girls who laugh a lot.

I don't want you
to fake a laugh,

18:12.591 --> 18:15.344
or fake being bad at
something for me.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.304
Okay.

18:17.387 --> 18:20.682
Now tell me, because
I'm dying to know.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.851
How did you
get so good?

18:23.435 --> 18:25.854
I grew up with all the
trees I can climb.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.689
{\an1}Makes you light
on your feet.

18:27.773 --> 18:28.398

See, I grew up
in the city.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.902
So not too
many trees.

18:31.985 --> 18:34.029
