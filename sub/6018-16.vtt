WEBVTT

00:02.435 --> 00:04.232
The whole concept of
the wanted poster...

00:05.805 --> 00:08.330
...has gotta be the most
optimistic crime-fighting idea.

00:08.508 --> 00:11.534
I mean, so how does it work?
Okay. I'm on line at the post office.

00:11.711 --> 00:14.179
I see the guy.
I see the list of offenses.

00:14.347 --> 00:16.747
I check the guy standing
in line behind me.

00:16.916 --> 00:21.444
If it's not him, that's
pretty much all I can do.

00:21.621 --> 00:25.148
Okay? It's not that
I don't want to help.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.521
Annoying thing is, why
didn't they hold on to this guy...

00:28.695 --> 00:30.458
...when they're taking his picture?

00:30.630 --> 00:33.997
"No, we don't do it that way. We
take their picture and we let them go.

00:34.167 --> 00:36.465
That's how we get
the front and side shot.

00:36.636 --> 00:39.366
The front is his face.
The side is him leaving."

00:45.812 --> 00:49.077
Look at you. Why don't you use a
fork. You're no good with the sticks.

00:49.249 --> 00:50.477
I know. I need a lesson.

00:50.650 --> 00:54.211
You stink. You know you stink.
What is this?

00:54.387 --> 00:56.082
Oh, my ballet tickets.

00:56.256 --> 00:58.554
Oh, your ballet tickets.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.317
Have you ever been to the ballet?

01:00.493 --> 01:02.984
No, but I've seen people on tiptoes.

01:03.163 --> 01:05.563
-You know, I'm going as a beard.
-A beard?

01:05.732 --> 01:08.565
Yeah. This friend of a friend
knows this banker guy.

01:08.735 --> 01:11.636
He's 30-ish, unbelievably gorgeous.

01:11.805 --> 01:14.273
-Of course he's gay.
-Yeah.

01:14.441 --> 01:17.433
So anyway, his boss has this box
at the Met, and he invited him...

01:17.610 --> 01:21.046
...to go see <i>Swan Lake</i> with him and
his wife. But he's afraid his boss...

01:21.214 --> 01:25.844
...can't handle his orientation.
So I'm going along as his date.

01:26.019 --> 01:29.284
-Why are you doing this?
-<i>Swan Lake</i> at the Met.

01:32.792 --> 01:34.657
-Yeah?
-<i>Get it on with your bad self.</i>

01:41.034 --> 01:43.434
Chinese food.
I knew I smelled something.

01:43.603 --> 01:47.004
-Yeah.
-Is George still wearing that toupee?

01:47.173 --> 01:49.107
-Yeah.
-Doesn't he know how ridiculous...

01:49.275 --> 01:52.005
-...he looks in that thing?
-I think he looks fantastic.

01:52.178 --> 01:54.976
Oh, come on.

01:55.148 --> 01:58.640
I never realized
what an attractive man he is.

01:59.018 --> 02:00.952
Oh, he's a real looker, that one.

02:05.959 --> 02:09.895
-Hey.
-People, people, people.

02:10.062 --> 02:12.122
Not bad, huh?

02:16.569 --> 02:19.697
All right. Excuse me.

02:19.873 --> 02:23.400
You look ridiculous in that thing.

02:23.576 --> 02:25.043
Is that so?

02:25.678 --> 02:28.738
Or could it be that you're
just a little bit worried...

02:28.915 --> 02:31.406
...that you may have
missed the boat?

02:33.319 --> 02:39.224
Well, I think they might have
sutured that thing to your brain.

02:42.795 --> 02:46.322
Oh, all right. Go ahead.
Deride. Deride if you must.

02:46.499 --> 02:47.830
But let me tell you something.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.936
With my personality and this head
of hair, you know what I am now?

02:51.337 --> 02:52.770
I am in the game.

02:52.939 --> 02:56.033
I no longer defer to the coifed.
I'm a player.

02:56.209 --> 02:57.699
You know, I thought of something.

02:57.877 --> 03:00.437
I know this gorgeous woman.
She called me up this morning.

03:00.613 --> 03:03.548
She's moving into the city,
and she asked if I knew anyone...

03:03.716 --> 03:06.446
...she could meet.
Now you can go out with her.

03:06.786 --> 03:10.620
-Well, what about me?
-No, I think he's got you beat, buddy.

03:11.658 --> 03:14.183
-So she's gorgeous?
-Yeah. Last time I saw her she was.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.089
-Five years ago.
-You got a picture?

03:16.262 --> 03:17.524
No, no.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.392
Well, I have to see her.

03:19.566 --> 03:20.828
Hey. I know what we can do.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.934
I got a friend, works
at the police station.

03:23.102 --> 03:25.297
-He's a composite artist.
-Really?

03:25.471 --> 03:28.133
-I can get him to draw a picture of her.
-I would love that.

03:28.308 --> 03:30.606
-You think he'd really do it?
-I think he will.

03:30.777 --> 03:33.837
It sounds like an excellent idea.

03:34.414 --> 03:37.315
You done with all this? I'm gonna
give it to a homeless person.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.412
Yeah, I'm very excited about this.

03:39.586 --> 03:42.578
I always wanted to see
how these sketch artists do it.

03:42.755 --> 03:44.552
Here you go, brother.
Some food for you.

03:44.924 --> 03:47.722
Thank you. You're a good man.
Bless you.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.055
-You gonna be here in an hour?
-Where am I going?

03:50.230 --> 03:51.993
All right. Enjoy.

03:52.165 --> 03:53.325
Wait up!

03:54.667 --> 03:55.759
That's good.

03:55.935 --> 03:57.800
And make the eyes....

03:57.971 --> 03:59.404
-What's that nut?
-Almonds?

03:59.572 --> 04:00.834
Almonds. Yeah. That's good.

04:01.341 --> 04:02.933
-Can I see--?
-No, no. Not yet.

04:03.109 --> 04:06.476
Yeah. And make
the lips fuller, poutier.

04:06.646 --> 04:08.136
Pouty? I like that.

04:08.314 --> 04:11.010
-You can't go wrong with pouty.
-I'm excited about the pouty.

04:11.184 --> 04:14.984
-All right. I think that about does it.
-George, come on. Take a look.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.723
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, my God. You were right.

04:17.890 --> 04:19.653
She is gorgeous.

04:19.826 --> 04:22.124
Hey, Lou, who's that
woman over there?

04:22.295 --> 04:24.627
Her? Oh, that's Sergeant Tierney.

04:24.797 --> 04:26.788
-Nice officer.
-You wanna meet her?

04:27.567 --> 04:29.228
Well, this worked out okay.

04:29.402 --> 04:30.767
You gonna see that policewoman?

04:30.937 --> 04:32.199
Yeah. I think I will.

04:32.372 --> 04:34.806
I like the idea of having
the law on my side.

04:34.974 --> 04:37.807
-Hey, man. Did you enjoy the food?
-Yes, I did.

04:37.977 --> 04:40.445
Where did the Chinese
learn to cook like that?

04:40.613 --> 04:42.843
Listen. I'll take that Tupperware now.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.347
I don't think so.

04:45.184 --> 04:46.173
That's mine.

04:46.352 --> 04:48.650
-You gave it to me.
-I didn't say you could keep it.

04:48.821 --> 04:50.345
See, I don't give away Tupperware.

04:50.523 --> 04:52.855
-You should've said something.
-I didn't think I had to.

04:53.026 --> 04:56.120
Look, with a piece of Tupperware,
you just assume.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.696
Oh, yeah!

05:03.803 --> 05:05.532
I've really gotta thank you for this.

05:05.705 --> 05:08.640
The bank I work for
is so conservative.

05:08.808 --> 05:12.209
Well, by now you'd think people
would be a little more open-minded.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.713
Excuse me.
I have to run to the bathroom.

05:15.882 --> 05:18.214
-Okay.
-Great.

05:18.384 --> 05:20.909
So....

05:21.454 --> 05:24.855
-You and Robert?
-Yep.

05:25.124 --> 05:28.059
-Really?
-Yes, indeedy.

05:28.628 --> 05:30.061
I'm surprised.

05:30.229 --> 05:32.220
Really? Why?

05:32.732 --> 05:34.393
No reason.

05:35.368 --> 05:37.495
Well, believe me.
This didn't happen overnight.

05:37.670 --> 05:41.731
Robert is not exactly a one-woman
man, if you know what I mean.

05:41.908 --> 05:43.773
No, sirree, Bob.

05:43.943 --> 05:47.504
Sure, I mean, in a lot of ways
he's a typical guy. He likes his sports.

05:47.680 --> 05:51.116
But he counters that side with the side
you see here tonight at the ballet...

05:51.284 --> 05:53.582
...or the pleasure he gets
watching Liza Minnelli...

05:53.753 --> 05:55.584
...belt out a few choice numbers.

05:56.022 --> 05:59.321
It's those two halves of his personality
that just come together...

05:59.492 --> 06:02.052
...to make him the
very special guy that he is.

06:02.495 --> 06:04.486
Excuse me. Sorry.

06:06.032 --> 06:08.057
Oh, hi, honey.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.702
It was just such a great night.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.741
And did they suspect anything?

06:19.245 --> 06:21.406
No, I was a fantastic beard.

06:21.581 --> 06:24.209
I held hands. I called him "honey."

06:24.851 --> 06:30.346
And we discover yet another talent:
posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.

06:32.091 --> 06:35.083
Oh, it was just such a great night.

06:35.261 --> 06:36.285
You said that already.

06:36.462 --> 06:38.487
-Oh, I did?
-Yeah.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.798
Oh, no.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.338
Don't tell me....

06:48.307 --> 06:49.638
You like him?

06:49.809 --> 06:52.004
He's incredible.

06:52.845 --> 06:54.472
Yeah, but....

06:54.647 --> 06:56.740
Yeah. I know.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.611
-So?
-What?

06:58.785 --> 07:00.844
Not conversion?

07:02.188 --> 07:03.985
You're thinking conversion?

07:04.290 --> 07:06.918
Well, it did occur to me.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.924
You think you can get him
to change teams?

07:09.095 --> 07:11.689
He's not gonna suddenly
switch sides.

07:11.864 --> 07:13.092
Forget about it.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.927
Why? Is it irrevocable?

07:15.101 --> 07:18.264
Because when you join that team,
it's not a whim.

07:18.438 --> 07:22.499
He likes his team.
He's set with that team.

07:23.142 --> 07:26.111
-But we've got a good team.
-Yeah, we do.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.712
We do have a good team.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.348
Well, why can't he play for us?

07:32.452 --> 07:36.252
They're only comfortable
with their equipment.

07:39.659 --> 07:42.685
But we just got along so great.

07:42.862 --> 07:46.229
Of course. Everyone gets along great
when there's no possibility of sex.

07:46.399 --> 07:49.163
No, no, no. I sensed something.
I did sense something.

07:49.335 --> 07:51.701
I perceived a possibility, Jerry.

07:55.374 --> 07:58.810
You realize you're venturing
into uncharted waters?

07:58.978 --> 08:00.206
I realize that.

08:00.613 --> 08:03.047
Are you that desperate?

08:03.883 --> 08:06.044
Yes, I am.

08:07.186 --> 08:08.551
Are you gonna bring your gun?

08:11.591 --> 08:14.059
Yeah, I think you should
leave it at home.

08:14.227 --> 08:18.391
I don't really know you that well. What
if we get into a fight or something?

08:18.564 --> 08:21.897
You know, you lose your temper.
Who knows what you're capable of.

08:22.068 --> 08:25.595
All right. Then it's settled.
First date, no weapons.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.806
All right. I'll see you then.

08:27.974 --> 08:29.464
Okay, bye.

08:31.143 --> 08:32.905
Yeah, yeah.

08:33.078 --> 08:34.671
Here we go.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.714
-What are you looking for?
-Tupperware.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.076
Sorry. I don't have any Tupperware.

08:40.385 --> 08:41.909
See, I knew this was gonna happen.

08:42.087 --> 08:44.522
I just made a delicious casserole,
but it won't keep...

08:44.690 --> 08:46.590
...because I have no Tupperware.

08:46.993 --> 08:50.053
-What about a plastic bag?
-You must be kidding.

08:50.229 --> 08:51.423
What is the difference?

08:51.597 --> 08:55.499
The patented burp, Jerry.
It locks in freshness.

08:56.836 --> 08:58.394
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:00.806 --> 09:04.742
So I spoke to your
little friend Denise last night.

09:04.911 --> 09:06.071
Oh, yeah. You talked, huh?

09:06.245 --> 09:08.645
Yeah. For two hours.
She's nuts about you.

09:08.814 --> 09:10.372
Yeah. We go way back, you know.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.950
Why didn't anything ever happen
between you two?

09:13.252 --> 09:15.413
Who's to say it didn't?

09:17.456 --> 09:19.754
So did you describe yourself
to her over the phone?

09:19.926 --> 09:21.450
Yes, I did.

09:21.627 --> 09:24.118
-What did you say?
-What do you think I said?

09:24.297 --> 09:25.457
I don't know.

09:26.032 --> 09:27.590
I told her the truth.

09:27.767 --> 09:29.359
As you see it?

09:32.004 --> 09:33.801
Yes, as I see it.

09:33.973 --> 09:37.306
Did you tell her about
your little hat there?

09:38.611 --> 09:39.942
What hat?

09:40.346 --> 09:42.644
You know, your little hair hat there.

09:44.183 --> 09:46.378
-No.
-Don't you think she could tell?

09:46.552 --> 09:50.682
No, no, no. She can't tell.
It's a perfect match. Beautiful job.

09:50.856 --> 09:54.656
Are you kidding? I could spot
that bird's nest two blocks away.

09:55.661 --> 09:57.629
You only think that
because you know me.

09:57.797 --> 09:59.287
Noticed people
staring at your head?

09:59.465 --> 10:03.060
I noticed people staring at my head
because they like what they see.

10:03.669 --> 10:06.103
You should either take it off
or tell her about it.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.672
He's not gonna take it off.
If he was gonna go bald...

10:08.841 --> 10:10.502
...I never would have
introduced them.

10:10.676 --> 10:13.509
-I guarantee she won't know.
-Yeah. That's it.

10:13.679 --> 10:16.204
I'm gonna go down to the precinct,
have lunch with Lou.

10:16.382 --> 10:17.849
Oh, I'll split a cab with you.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.682
Hey, I'm really sorry about the
other day, man. Really sorry.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.953
Hey, that's my coffee.

10:29.228 --> 10:30.525
-Hi, sarge.
-Hi.

10:30.696 --> 10:35.099
I'm sorry I'm late. Some of our
lineup decoys didn't show, so....

10:35.267 --> 10:38.532
Hey, any of you guys want to be in
the lineup, make a quick 50 bucks?

10:38.704 --> 10:40.501
Sure, I will.

10:41.707 --> 10:45.643
Perfect. Okay. Just go right
over there with Officer Lampart.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.278
All right.

10:49.000 --> 10:55.074

11:02.595 --> 11:04.654
All of you, turn to the left.

11:07.266 --> 11:08.858
The left.

11:15.741 --> 11:17.902
Now, turn to the right.

11:27.553 --> 11:30.147
<i>Oh, my God. There she is.
That's the face.</i>

11:30.322 --> 11:31.584
<i>Just like the picture.</i>

11:31.757 --> 11:33.486
-George?
-Yeah. Hi.

11:33.659 --> 11:35.718
-It's great to meet you.
-Likewise.

11:35.895 --> 11:38.830
-Have you been waiting long or--?
-No. I got here two minutes ago.

11:38.998 --> 11:40.761
Good, good.

11:42.001 --> 11:45.164
Well, why don't you take off
your hat, stay a while.

11:52.812 --> 11:55.440
-What's that?
-A polygraph.

11:55.614 --> 11:57.639
What you civilians call
a lie detector test.

11:57.817 --> 12:00.081
Let me ask you.
Now, when someone is lying...

12:00.252 --> 12:03.688
...is it true that their pants
are actually on fire?

12:04.190 --> 12:06.988
If I could tell you the famous faces
that have been up here....

12:07.159 --> 12:08.148
Get out.

12:08.327 --> 12:10.591
A certain cast member
of <i>Melrose Place</i>.

12:10.763 --> 12:11.991
Really?

12:12.164 --> 12:15.793
-Have you ever seen the show?
-No.

12:16.836 --> 12:19.327
You can admit it, Jerry. It's okay.

12:19.505 --> 12:22.770
I'd admit it. I don't watch it.

12:22.942 --> 12:25.467
Hey, Lou. Maybe we should
put him on the poly.

12:25.644 --> 12:29.478
-The poly?
-Yeah. I think you've seen it.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.748
<i>Melrose Place</i> ?

12:40.760 --> 12:43.752
Yes, <i>Melrose Place</i>.

12:43.929 --> 12:47.956
-I just didn't know you watch that.
-Well, I do.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.459
Every time I've mentioned it...

12:51.637 --> 12:54.868
...you never say anything
or join in the conversation.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.271
Well, maybe I was
a little embarrassed.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.571
You mean, this whole time,
we could have been...

13:00.746 --> 13:03.374
...discussing Sydney
and Michael and Jane?

13:03.549 --> 13:07.815
And Billy and Jake and Allison.
Yes, we could have discussed it.

13:08.254 --> 13:09.983
Why? Why were you
so embarrassed?

13:10.156 --> 13:12.021
I'm gonna be taking
this lie detector test.

13:12.191 --> 13:14.159
That needle's gonna be going wild.

13:15.528 --> 13:18.827
This is so stupid.

13:18.998 --> 13:22.331
-Why don't you just confess?
-It's too stupid to confess.

13:22.501 --> 13:24.298
Look what I'm confessing to.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.131
Well, what are you gonna do?

13:26.305 --> 13:29.468
I don't know. Maybe I could
beat the machine.

13:29.642 --> 13:33.043
Who do you think you are,
Costanza?

13:33.813 --> 13:37.749
Hey, you know what? I have access to
one of the most deceitful, duplicitous...

13:37.917 --> 13:42.980
...deceptive minds of our time.
Who better to advise me?

13:43.155 --> 13:45.020
Oh, God, this is terrible.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.189
-Did you shake it up?
-No.

13:47.359 --> 13:49.554
-You gotta shake it up.
-No. I'm sick of shaking.

13:49.728 --> 13:50.990
You gotta shake everything.

13:52.865 --> 13:55.265
Yeah, that's a real nuisance.

13:58.103 --> 13:59.365
Oh, this is killing me.

14:01.874 --> 14:03.239
-Yeah.
-<i>Yeah.</i>

14:03.909 --> 14:07.936
So I'm going out tonight
with Robert...

14:08.113 --> 14:10.411
...and the boss and his wife.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.107
So tonight you gonna
make the move?

14:12.284 --> 14:14.184
Yeah, I think I might.

14:17.389 --> 14:19.152
Hey, there he is.

14:19.792 --> 14:22.386
So, what happened?
Could she detect it?

14:22.561 --> 14:24.461
-That's an interesting question.
-How so?

14:24.630 --> 14:26.655
How so?

14:26.832 --> 14:29.630
I'll tell you how so.

14:29.802 --> 14:32.100
She's bald.

14:32.671 --> 14:33.899
What do you mean, "bald"?

14:34.073 --> 14:38.100
What do you think I mean? Bald.
Bald. Bald, bald.

14:39.211 --> 14:43.307
-She's bald?
-She's bald, Jerry.

14:43.482 --> 14:46.076
-Oh, come on.
-Oh, come on?

14:46.252 --> 14:50.018
No "come on." She took off
her hat, and there she was.

14:50.189 --> 14:52.123
"Hello."

14:52.758 --> 14:55.226
It was like I was looking at myself
in the mirror.

14:56.495 --> 14:59.225
Well, maybe she got a haircut
or something.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.760
You know, let me tell you something.

15:01.934 --> 15:06.701
No one walks into a beauty parlor
and says, "Give me the Larry Fine."

15:09.141 --> 15:10.938
Women go bald?

15:11.110 --> 15:13.738
Yeah, I've heard of that.
I mean, they usually wear a wig.

15:14.380 --> 15:15.574
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey.

15:15.748 --> 15:16.942
Hey.

15:17.116 --> 15:19.676
You fixed me up with a bald woman.

15:22.221 --> 15:23.483
-Bald?
-Yeah, that's right.

15:23.656 --> 15:26.022
Do you see the irony here?

15:26.191 --> 15:31.060
You're rejecting somebody
because they're bald.

15:31.964 --> 15:34.125
So?

15:34.433 --> 15:37.095
You're bald!

15:37.670 --> 15:39.467
No, I'm not.

15:39.638 --> 15:42.971
I was bald.

15:44.410 --> 15:46.139
Elaine.

15:46.378 --> 15:48.437
Hey, hey. Hey, come on.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.641
No, no, no! Elaine!

15:52.818 --> 15:55.252
I don't like this thing!

15:55.421 --> 15:57.616
And here's what I'm doing with it!

15:57.790 --> 15:59.451
Don't!

16:14.707 --> 16:18.803
-You started that fight with me.
-I figured that's what couples do.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.912
You almost convinced me
we were a couple.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.412
It was easy. Really.

16:23.582 --> 16:25.573
Well, good night.
I'll call you tomorrow.

16:25.751 --> 16:28.219
Oh, wait a second.

16:28.754 --> 16:32.190
Would you like to come upstairs?

16:32.591 --> 16:33.819
Upstairs?

16:34.827 --> 16:36.385
Yeah.

16:36.795 --> 16:38.319
Upstairs?

16:39.431 --> 16:40.864
Elaine--

16:41.033 --> 16:43.263
I was hoping, you know...

16:43.435 --> 16:47.098
...you might be interested
in changing teams.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.038
Changing teams?

16:50.676 --> 16:52.735
Have you ever thought about it?

16:53.879 --> 16:55.870
But I'm a starting shortstop.

16:56.615 --> 17:00.346
Robert, we need a shortstop.

17:00.519 --> 17:03.010
Real bad.

17:04.256 --> 17:06.281
When she threw that toupee
out the window...

17:06.458 --> 17:08.653
...it was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

17:08.827 --> 17:12.387
I feel like my old self again: totally
inadequate, completely insecure...

17:12.564 --> 17:15.556
...paranoid, neurotic.
It's a pleasure.

17:15.733 --> 17:17.133
It's good to have you back.

17:17.301 --> 17:18.963
You know what else
I've decided to do?

17:19.137 --> 17:20.730
I'm gonna keep seeing
the bald woman.

17:20.906 --> 17:22.964
She's as good as anybody else.

17:23.142 --> 17:25.109
Scalp was clean.

17:26.111 --> 17:28.079
She had a nice skull.

17:29.081 --> 17:31.276
There just wasn't a lot of hair on it.

17:31.450 --> 17:35.216
You know, you've had, like, a religious
awakening. You're like a bald-again.

17:36.622 --> 17:38.351
Gonna need
a little more coffee here.

17:38.524 --> 17:41.152
So, George, how do I beat
this lie detector?

17:41.860 --> 17:43.794
I'm sorry. Jerry, I can't help you.

17:43.962 --> 17:46.556
You got the gift. You're the only one
that could help me.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.199
Jerry, I can't.

17:48.367 --> 17:53.066
It's like saying to Pavarotti,
"Teach me to sing like you."

17:54.573 --> 17:56.564
All right. Well, I gotta go
take this test.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.607
I can't believe I'm doing this.

17:59.778 --> 18:02.576
Jerry, just remember:

18:02.981 --> 18:06.508
It's not a lie if you believe it.

18:12.691 --> 18:14.283
-Hey.
-Hey. I did it.

18:14.460 --> 18:17.452
-What?
-I turned him. He defected.

18:17.830 --> 18:20.321
Get out. How?

18:20.499 --> 18:24.196
-How did you do that?
-Because I'm a woman.

18:27.739 --> 18:29.172
Do you know what you've done?

18:29.341 --> 18:32.708
You've given hope to every woman
who's ever said, "Too bad he's gay."

18:32.878 --> 18:36.177
Well, it's a lesson for the kids
out there. Anything is possible.

18:36.348 --> 18:37.872
Indeed.

18:38.050 --> 18:42.487
Jeromy, I have hit the jackpot.
The perfect man.

18:42.654 --> 18:44.952
Nothing but sex and shopping.

19:14.620 --> 19:15.882
What's your name?

19:16.054 --> 19:17.749
Jerry Seinfeld.

19:17.923 --> 19:19.220
What is your address?

19:19.391 --> 19:21.757
129 West 81st Street.

19:21.927 --> 19:24.657
Did Kimberly steal Jo's baby?

19:29.968 --> 19:31.333
I don't know.

19:31.737 --> 19:34.865
Did Billy sleep with
Allison's best friend?

19:36.909 --> 19:38.774
I don't know.

19:41.914 --> 19:45.907
Did Jane's fiancé kidnap Sydney
and take her to Las Vegas?

19:46.084 --> 19:47.881
And if so, did she enjoy it?

19:51.690 --> 19:53.590
I don't know.

19:53.759 --> 19:55.693
Did Jane sleep with Michael again?

19:58.463 --> 19:59.452
Yes!

19:59.631 --> 20:01.929
Yes. That stupid idiot.
He left her for Kimberly.

20:02.100 --> 20:05.297
He slept with her sister, tricked her
into giving him half her business.

20:05.470 --> 20:07.370
Then she goes and
sleeps with him again?

20:07.539 --> 20:10.235
She's crazy. How could she do
something like that? That Jane!

20:10.409 --> 20:11.899
Oh, she just makes me so mad!

20:18.483 --> 20:19.950
He went back?

20:20.552 --> 20:22.543
What do you mean, he went back?

20:22.721 --> 20:23.813
He went back.

20:23.989 --> 20:27.390
I don't understand. You were having
a great time. The sex, the shopping.

20:27.559 --> 20:29.459
Well, here's the thing.

20:32.331 --> 20:33.764
Being a woman...

20:33.932 --> 20:38.426
...I only really have access to the...

20:38.604 --> 20:40.196
...equipment...

20:40.372 --> 20:43.569
...what, 30, 45 minutes a week?

20:43.742 --> 20:45.471
And that's on a good week.

20:45.644 --> 20:48.613
How can I be expected
to have the same expertise...

20:48.780 --> 20:52.546
...as people who own
this equipment...

20:53.385 --> 20:58.254
...and have access to it
24 hours a day, their entire lives?

20:58.423 --> 20:59.412
You can't.

20:59.591 --> 21:02.151
That's why they lose
very few players.

21:04.062 --> 21:06.792
Yeah, I guess I never really
stood a chance.

21:06.965 --> 21:09.832
Well, there's always a place
for you on our team.

21:10.002 --> 21:13.028
Yeah, thanks.

21:13.905 --> 21:15.270
Is <i>Melrose Place</i> on?

21:15.874 --> 21:18.809
-Yeah, coming on in a few minutes.
-Okay.

21:21.146 --> 21:23.011
Hey. Don't worry, it hasn't started.

21:26.585 --> 21:29.383
Hey, you know, George,
I am really proud of you.

21:29.554 --> 21:32.387
I really do admire what you've done.

21:32.557 --> 21:34.184
Do you?

21:34.359 --> 21:36.657
That makes me so happy.

21:38.563 --> 21:40.724
Elaine's proud of me, Jerry.

21:40.899 --> 21:41.991
What is the matter?

21:42.167 --> 21:45.500
I got rejected by a bald woman.

21:46.171 --> 21:49.732
-What?
-A bald woman rejected me.

21:49.908 --> 21:50.897
You like that one?

21:51.243 --> 21:56.681
A woman with no prospects and
no hair told me that I wasn't her type.

21:56.848 --> 21:59.339
Apparently baldy likes
a slimmer guy.

21:59.518 --> 22:01.611
Well, I'll tell you what I think.

22:01.787 --> 22:06.247
I think she saw you with
that piece off and was devastated.

22:06.425 --> 22:10.361
You blew it, boy. You really blew it!

22:11.563 --> 22:15.055
And you had to ruin it for him,
didn't you?

22:15.233 --> 22:18.498
I didn't ruin anything.
He looked like an idiot.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.763
-No.
-And it made him act like a jerk.

22:20.939 --> 22:23.999
All right. Shut up. Shut up.
<i>Melrose Place</i> is coming on.

22:30.115 --> 22:34.074
Oh, that Michael. I hate him.
He's just so smug.

22:45.564 --> 22:48.897
Hey, how you doing, Stu?
Eddie, my man, huh?

22:50.869 --> 22:54.168
You again?
Boy, you're a slippery one.

22:54.339 --> 22:56.534
You better straighten up
and fly right, buddy boy.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.403
-What do you got?
-An eyewitness...

22:58.577 --> 23:00.442
...to that jewelry store break-in.

23:00.612 --> 23:02.204
Come here.

23:03.882 --> 23:05.747
Do you recognize
anybody in this lineup?

23:08.320 --> 23:11.255
That's the guy, officer.
The guy there in the middle.

23:11.423 --> 23:15.257
The tall guy with the high hair.
I'd recognize him anywhere.

23:15.727 --> 23:18.161
Hey, you. You with the high hair.

23:18.330 --> 23:20.195
Step forward.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.062
Me?

23:24.305 --> 23:30.925
