challenged?

12:30.951 --> 12:32.619
to chip away at this lead
before halftime.

12:32.685 --> 12:34.687
They're not shooting well.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.489
Open at the wing
is Reynolds.

12:36.556 --> 12:37.757
He puts it up...

12:37.825 --> 12:40.260
Oh, no good.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.262
Oh, man.

12:42.329 --> 12:44.164
Reynolds misses
another shot,

12:44.231 --> 12:46.333
and that's the end
of the first half.

12:46.399 --> 12:47.734
Minnesota Timberwolves
out in front of the Knights

12:47.801 --> 12:48.869
by 12,

12:48.936 --> 12:50.270
and once again,

12:50.337 --> 12:52.572
the Knights did not play
very good basketball

12:52.639 --> 12:54.975
in the first half.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.978
Hey, good half.
Good half.

12:58.045 --> 12:59.880
Good half.
We're in great shape.

12:59.947 --> 13:02.615
Great shape.
We'll win it back. Yeah.

13:02.682 --> 13:04.051
Henderson, attaboy.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.386
It's permissible to run
in this game, incidentally.

13:06.453 --> 13:10.891
Yeah. Dvigatsya, Krilov.
Dvigatsya. Yeah.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.326
Man: Tracy.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.963
Tracy Reynolds,
hey, what a wizard.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.730
You're a magician
out there tonight.

13:17.797 --> 13:18.999
Small favor.

13:19.066 --> 13:21.701
Oh, no. No, no. I don't
do halftime shows, man.

13:21.768 --> 13:23.203
I'm not some
chalupa giveaway.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.172
Hey, those chalupas
upped attendance by 4,000.

13:25.238 --> 13:27.774
You're familiar
with Mr. Granger,

13:27.841 --> 13:28.976
the man
who owns the team?

13:29.042 --> 13:30.743
I have a very good
relationship

13:30.810 --> 13:31.811
with Mr. Granger.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.813
He hasn't called me
in 4 years.

13:33.881 --> 13:34.848
He called this morning.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.383
And he's ready
to clean house

13:36.449 --> 13:38.986
if we don't put some
asses in those seats.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.922
Hello, Los Angeles!

13:41.989 --> 13:45.158

to your halftime show!

will get the chance

13:48.261 --> 13:51.264
to go one-on-one
with Tracy Reynolds,

your L.A. Knights.

14:32.839 --> 14:35.708
Yeah. Yeah, very excited.

Well, so am I.

Come on down!
Show us what you got!

14:58.531 --> 14:59.599
Naw, I got the ticket.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.768
Listen, you little runt,
if you can't score on me,

15:01.834 --> 15:02.835
how you gonna get by a Knight?

15:02.902 --> 15:05.472
Oh, shoot, here come
a redcoat. Security.

15:05.538 --> 15:06.439
Psych!

15:06.506 --> 15:08.108
Stop.

15:16.883 --> 15:20.187
And here comes
our winner now.

15:29.963 --> 15:33.033
All right. Heh heh.

15:33.100 --> 15:37.937
Well...boy, this is
gonna be some contest.

15:38.871 --> 15:40.440
Well, son,

what's your name?

15:41.874 --> 15:45.245
Ahem. Ca--
Calvin Cambridge.

15:45.312 --> 15:49.116
Well, Calvin, I'd like you
to meet Tracy Reynolds.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.652
Man, this is--this is crazy.

15:52.719 --> 15:53.686
This is so cool.

15:53.753 --> 15:54.654
How you doin', little man?

15:54.721 --> 15:55.922
Tracy.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.024
All right.

15:57.090 --> 16:00.193
I'm playing Tracy.
I'm playing...

16:00.260 --> 16:01.494
I can't even say it.
I'm so happy.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.963
I'm playing T-time.
[ Amplifier Feedback ]

supposed to do that?

[Thump Thump Thump]

16:08.068 --> 16:09.402
Man, this is
kind of loud.

Hey, stand up.
Can you hear me?

16:11.238 --> 16:12.705
Murph, stand up.
Calvin!

16:12.772 --> 16:13.706
I can't hear you.

16:13.773 --> 16:15.742
Calvin, up here!

16:15.808 --> 16:16.976
I still can't hear you.

Jump up and down
like a rabbit or something.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.548
The crowd is eating this up.
Don't embarrass the kid.

16:21.614 --> 16:22.782
Let him score twice.

16:22.849 --> 16:23.783
Once.

16:23.850 --> 16:24.817
Twice!

16:24.884 --> 16:26.986
Once.

Hey, Murph, we gotta
get one of these.

16:29.189 --> 16:33.093
OK, OK, Calvin.
Very good.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.862
Now, you're gonna
have 60 seconds, OK?

tie your shoe.

16:41.934 --> 16:43.203
Thank you, sir.

to be loose,
not their laces.

That was really nice.

Can't go that way.
Can't go that way.

it was like that.

it was like that?

How did I do that?

with an impressive 30-footer.

wasn't it?

about this kid

be a bad time

for your autograph, huh?

Look, coach, I know attendance
is in the crapper, OK,

20:38.037 --> 20:40.973
and I'm not averse to using
the word "gimmick."

20:41.040 --> 20:42.542
This is about making money.

20:43.543 --> 20:47.947
I see. And speaking
of money...

20:48.014 --> 20:49.549
ah, yes, money.

Mr. Bittleman, I'm prepared
to make you an offer

20:53.486 --> 20:58.591
of $5,000 for
a one-day contract.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.860
Ah...well.

I'm Calvin's guardian,

21:07.066 --> 21:08.935

21:09.001 --> 21:12.138
I do have to make certain that
nobody takes advantage of him.

You mean except for you?

uh, perhaps, uh...

something special about Calvin.

Wow, man, you're
on the Knights.

I can't believe you're gonna
get to play in the NBA.

I still can't believe
what happened to me yesterday.

with the rock, I could do.

that "J." Fade-away.

a good question.

is that before I had these...

gonna strike midnight

Wow, I wish I was
going with you.

about the other day.

No, no, no. It's all right,
little man.

23:18.965 --> 23:20.266

all right? You got lucky.

official shirt, shorts,

23:32.679 --> 23:35.247

23:35.314 --> 23:38.384
Uh, but I like
my own sneakers.

23:38.451 --> 23:42.388
Oh...ours aren't
good enough for the kid.

23:42.455 --> 23:44.657
No, it's nothing like that.

23:44.724 --> 23:46.493
It's just that
I play better in mine.

23:46.559 --> 23:49.462
Play? You just
have to look good.

23:53.132 --> 23:55.201
What do you mean?

24:00.873 --> 24:04.143
Coach, may I please
ask you a question?

24:04.210 --> 24:05.945
Sure.

24:06.012 --> 24:08.981
Coach, I have a lot of friends
here tonight, and, uh...

24:09.048 --> 24:13.786
I was just wondering...
wondering am I here to play,

24:13.853 --> 24:16.455
or am I just here for show?

24:20.560 --> 24:23.696
Calvin, I'm gonna
be straight with you.

24:23.763 --> 24:27.967
You were hired tonight
just to increase attendance,

24:28.034 --> 24:29.168
not to play.

24:29.235 --> 24:30.436
Man...

24:30.503 --> 24:32.739
But...I saw the tape

24:32.805 --> 24:36.042
of that halftime show
you put on.

24:36.108 --> 24:38.077
You got some game.

24:38.144 --> 24:42.181
I am honored
to have you on my team.

24:43.382 --> 24:45.151
Thanks, coach.

24:45.217 --> 24:46.986
You bet.

24:51.223 --> 24:52.692
Whoo!

24:59.799 --> 25:01.834
Geoff: We've got a bigger
than usual crowd tonight,

25:01.901 --> 25:03.502
and a lot
of it is curiosity.

25:03.570 --> 25:04.904
The Knights have
a brand new player.

25:04.971 --> 25:07.607
He's 4 foot, 8 inch
Calvin Cambridge,

25:07.674 --> 25:09.676
joining us straight
from the playground

25:09.742 --> 25:11.578
of the Chesterfield
group home.

25:11.644 --> 25:13.212
Reggie, your reaction.

25:13.279 --> 25:14.847
Geoff, this
is unprecedented.

25:14.914 --> 25:16.215
I can't imagine what
the Knights players

25:16.282 --> 25:17.049
are thinking.
We're just gonna

25:17.116 --> 25:18.050
have to wait and
see what happens.

25:18.117 --> 25:19.451
We're gonna
find out shortly.

25:19.518 --> 25:20.753
Both clubs
are taking the court

25:20.820 --> 25:23.389
as we get ready
for tonight's opening tip.

25:23.455 --> 25:25.658
Go Knights!

25:36.202 --> 25:37.169
What was that?!

25:39.672 --> 25:41.240
Admiral! Admiral!

25:45.978 --> 25:47.246
The admiral
just waved at me.

25:47.313 --> 25:50.116
He just waved
at me. Admiral!

25:50.182 --> 25:51.250
Hey--

25:57.356 --> 25:58.991
Come on! Hey! Hey!

25:59.058 --> 26:00.827
Geoff: Coach Wagner of
the Knights has seen enough.

26:00.893 --> 26:03.262
He wants
and gets a time-out.

26:05.732 --> 26:08.400
Let's go. Let's go.
Good hustle, baby.

26:08.467 --> 26:09.669
What?

26:12.571 --> 26:15.675
Come on, guys.
It's not funny.

26:15.742 --> 26:17.944
Now, offense,
is there any play

26:18.010 --> 26:19.345
that's gonna work
for us tonight?

26:19.411 --> 26:20.379
I have an idea.

26:20.446 --> 26:22.181
Oh, man.

26:22.248 --> 26:23.950
I've been watching,

26:24.016 --> 26:25.618
and they're vulnerable
from the weak side,

26:25.685 --> 26:27.053
especially to a pick set
away from the hoop.

26:29.121 --> 26:30.389
Why don't we run
the give-and-give-and-go?

26:30.456 --> 26:31.791
You mean
the give-and-go?

26:31.858 --> 26:33.793
No, see, they'll
be expecting that.

26:33.860 --> 26:36.062
Have Tracy feed
the ball to Henderson.

26:36.128 --> 26:37.529
Henderson's gonna
feed the ball to Joad.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.198
Joad's gonna pass it
back to Tracy.

26:39.265 --> 26:40.767
As Henderson sets the pick,

26:40.833 --> 26:43.636
Tracy's gonna take the shot.

26:46.605 --> 26:47.940
I like it.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.441
Oh, no. No. I'm not
gonna run some play

26:49.508 --> 26:50.576
by some
snotty-nosed kid, man.

26:50.643 --> 26:52.879
Damn straight, coach.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.747
Fine. Henderson,
you're out.

26:54.814 --> 26:56.182
Tracy, you take
Henderson's slot.

26:56.248 --> 26:58.084
Calvin, you take the shot.

26:58.150 --> 26:59.151
What?

27:11.397 --> 27:12.198
Have you
lost your mind?

27:12.264 --> 27:13.733
You said I could
play anybody I want.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.968
Yeah, well,
I didn't mean him.

27:16.035 --> 27:17.603
Am I the coach
or not?

27:17.670 --> 27:19.839
You are. For now.

27:19.906 --> 27:21.173
Can you believe it, Reggie?

27:21.240 --> 27:23.309
It looks like
the kid's gonna play.

27:30.182 --> 27:32.852
A rousing welcome for
the man they came to see,

27:32.919 --> 27:34.687
the little fella,
Calvin Cambridge,

27:34.754 --> 27:35.855
into the game
for the Knights.

27:49.235 --> 27:52.071
Calvin! Run the play!

27:55.742 --> 27:58.144
What's he doin'?

28:00.646 --> 28:02.348
Run the play.
No.

28:02.414 --> 28:04.416
Would you just
run the play?

28:05.885 --> 28:07.920
Time out! White!

28:09.521 --> 28:10.622
Why'd you call time out?

28:10.689 --> 28:12.424
Uh...I gotta pee.

28:14.493 --> 28:16.062
He's gotta pee.

28:16.128 --> 28:18.397
Announcer: Calvin Cambridge
is calling for

28:18.464 --> 28:20.099
a bathroom break?

28:20.166 --> 28:22.802
I guess when you gotta go,
Reggie, you gotta go.

28:22.869 --> 28:25.738
[Crowd Laughs]

28:49.161 --> 28:50.062
Yes!

28:54.366 --> 28:55.567
The crowd is roaring.

28:55.634 --> 28:56.836
That can mean
just one thing.

28:56.903 --> 28:59.005
That little guy,
Calvin Cambridge,

28:59.071 --> 29:01.007
has taken care of business
in the locker room

29:01.073 --> 29:02.341
and is back on the court.

29:02.408 --> 29:03.309
He's done.

29:25.597 --> 29:28.067
Ladies and gentlemen,
this kid's for real.

29:28.134 --> 29:30.736
He can play some basketball.

29:30.803 --> 29:33.372
* Tied up, tied up *

29:33.439 --> 29:34.841
* You got me so *

29:34.907 --> 29:37.076
* You got me so *

29:38.377 --> 29:41.147
* Doo doo do-do-do-do
do-do-do-do-do *

29:41.213 --> 29:45.184
* Do-do-do doo doo
do-doo *

29:45.251 --> 29:49.121
* Doo doo do-do-do-do
do-do-do-do-do *

29:49.188 --> 29:51.423
* Do-do-do doo doo
do-doo *

29:56.428 --> 29:58.865
Slam dunk
over David Robinson!

29:58.931 --> 30:00.867
Unbelievable!

30:00.933 --> 30:04.103
12 seconds to go,
the Knights trail by 2.

30:04.170 --> 30:06.105
Trying to find some way
to actually come back

30:06.172 --> 30:07.874
and win this thing.

30:19.886 --> 30:22.922
It's good! The Knights win!

30:32.932 --> 30:35.401
Am I a genius
or what? Huh?

30:35.467 --> 30:37.904
Tell me
I'm a genius!

30:39.071 --> 30:42.441
Announcer:
This is the NBA on NBC.

30:43.976 --> 30:45.677
The big story in the NBA:

30:45.744 --> 30:48.147
Calvin Cambridge,
the 4 foot 8 dynamo,

30:48.214 --> 30:50.016
has now signed
a lucrative contract

30:50.082 --> 30:51.083
with the Knights.

30:51.150 --> 30:52.384
And no wonder,
after he led them

30:52.451 --> 30:54.820
to a come-from-behind
win over the Spurs

30:54.887 --> 30:56.923
with 27 points?
That kid was unbelievable.

30:56.989 --> 30:58.991
Did I just see
the admiral saluting him

30:59.058 --> 31:00.192
at the end of the game?

31:00.259 --> 31:01.760
You know, Cambridge's
contract makes him

31:01.827 --> 31:03.629
the youngest,
and the shortest person

31:03.695 --> 31:05.297
ever to sign a deal
with the NBA.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.799
He's lean, he's mean,
he's 13.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.168
Yeah, now all the kids
are gonna be saying,

31:09.235 --> 31:10.369
"I wanna be like Calvin."

31:10.436 --> 31:11.470
Well, I guarantee you
one thing,

31:11.537 --> 31:13.505
this orphan will not
be an orphan for long.

31:16.142 --> 31:19.045
I can't believe you're going
on the road with the Knights.

31:19.111 --> 31:20.879
Can I fit in your suitcase?

31:20.947 --> 31:22.348
Hey, what
about me?

31:23.815 --> 31:24.883
Bittleman.

31:26.752 --> 31:29.521
Hey, Calvin, this is great.

31:29.588 --> 31:32.124
Well, uh, I'm proud of you.

31:32.191 --> 31:34.393
Listen, uh,
when you're on the road,

31:34.460 --> 31:36.929
uh, people might
want to adopt you.

31:36.996 --> 31:40.399
But you should realize
it's, uh,

31:40.466 --> 31:42.268
only because
you're a celebrity now,

31:42.334 --> 31:44.937
and, uh, they're
just after your money.

31:45.004 --> 31:49.675
Besides,
your contract forbids it.

31:49.741 --> 31:51.143
Wait a minute,
forbids it?

31:53.079 --> 31:55.914
Oh, yeah.
Didn't I tell you?

31:55.982 --> 31:59.585
Uh, I signed your contract
as your guardian,

31:59.651 --> 32:03.855
so, um, as long as you're
playing for the Knights,

32:03.922 --> 32:07.059
that can't change.

32:14.166 --> 32:15.634
Hey, coach, check this out!

32:17.669 --> 32:19.071
Pretty good.

32:24.276 --> 32:27.346
Welcome to Self-Hypnosis
for the Fearful Flier.

32:27.413 --> 32:29.415
During today's
peaceful flight,

32:29.481 --> 32:30.516
you'll transport
yourself into a state--

32:30.582 --> 32:31.517
Tracy.

32:31.583 --> 32:32.985
What?

32:33.052 --> 32:35.554
Relax. Flight's fine.

32:35.621 --> 32:36.655
Just came by to say hello.

32:36.722 --> 32:38.624
OK, my bad. I'm sorry.

32:38.690 --> 32:41.893
You are familiar with
the NBA mentoring program,

32:41.960 --> 32:43.629
are you not?

32:43.695 --> 32:44.963
Oh, no. No. No. No.

32:45.031 --> 32:45.998
You don't even know
what I'm gonna ask.

32:46.065 --> 32:47.233
No, I do know what
you're gonna ask,

32:47.299 --> 32:48.334
and it's not
gonna happen.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.401
You're trying
to punish me.

32:49.468 --> 32:50.702
No.

32:52.704 --> 32:54.573
The kid's rooming with you.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.575
I think it would be good
for both of you.

32:56.642 --> 32:57.609
[Crash]

32:57.676 --> 32:58.910
We're goin' down!

32:58.977 --> 33:01.647
[People Laugh]

33:01.713 --> 33:04.083
Whoa. Whoa.

33:05.917 --> 33:08.287
No. No. No. There is
no way in the world

33:08.354 --> 33:09.455
I'm gonna be roomin'
with that kid.

33:09.521 --> 33:11.090
I'm callin' my agent.
You know why?

33:11.157 --> 33:12.258
'Cause it
ain't gonna happen.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.428
This gonna be
so cool roomin' together.

33:16.495 --> 33:19.165
Uh, my boy Murph
says I snore.

33:19.231 --> 33:20.466
I think he has to be
trippin' sometimes.

33:20.532 --> 33:21.833
Maybe we could
rent NBA Street.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.001
Or if you
don't like that,

33:23.069 --> 33:24.136
we could play Monopoly.

33:24.203 --> 33:25.271
Or if you
don't like Monopoly,

33:25.337 --> 33:26.738
then we could just
sit around and rap,

33:26.805 --> 33:28.006
because I love to talk.

33:28.074 --> 33:29.341
Oh, yeah, I noticed.

33:29.408 --> 33:31.543
Have fun, Tracy.
[Laughs]

33:32.644 --> 33:33.879
All right, look.

33:33.945 --> 33:35.081
Coach says
I gotta room with you,

33:35.147 --> 33:36.848
so let me set down
the rules right now.

33:36.915 --> 33:38.984
First of all,
I ain't your boy, OK?

33:39.051 --> 33:40.018
I'm not gonna be playin'
Monopoly with you,

33:40.086 --> 33:41.287
Game Cube, Rubik's Cube--

33:41.353 --> 33:42.788
Anything with a cube,
I ain't playin'.

33:42.854 --> 33:45.357
Third, you know, I'm not gonna
be tuckin' you in at night,

33:45.424 --> 33:46.525
and I'm definitely
not gonna read you

33:46.592 --> 33:48.360
the Three Little Bears,
you got that?

33:49.295 --> 33:51.897
Whoa! Look at this!

33:51.963 --> 33:54.633
Do we always stay
in places this fancy?

33:54.700 --> 33:55.734
Mm-hmm.

34:15.087 --> 34:17.723
OK.

34:17.789 --> 34:18.956
All right,
I'm goin' out.

34:19.024 --> 34:22.860
Oh, um, w-would you
like some company?

34:22.928 --> 34:24.996
No. No,
I wouldn't like company.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.065
Well, what do I do?

34:27.132 --> 34:30.202
Uh, well, um...

34:30.268 --> 34:32.404
oh, call room service.
Get some food.

34:32.471 --> 34:35.541
But what's
room service?

34:35.607 --> 34:38.143
Right. Right. OK.
Here's what you do.

34:39.245 --> 34:40.078
You pick up
this phone, right?

34:40.146 --> 34:41.280
Mm-hmm.

34:41.347 --> 34:43.349
And you dial "6".
Tell them what you want

34:43.415 --> 34:46.784
and they'll bring it
to the room...for free.

34:46.851 --> 34:47.853
For free?

34:47.918 --> 34:49.420
For free.
You got it. Eat up.

34:49.487 --> 34:52.023
No, you gotta be
messin' with me, right?

34:52.090 --> 34:53.958
No, I'm not.
Try it yourself.

34:54.025 --> 34:55.092
For free.

34:58.029 --> 34:59.030
Hello?

34:59.097 --> 35:01.800
Uh, yes. Um,
is this room service?

35:01.867 --> 35:02.834
Yes, it is.

35:02.901 --> 35:04.035
And will you really

35:04.102 --> 35:05.471
bring me up
some food for free?

35:05.537 --> 35:07.706
Well, sure.
Anything you like, sir.

35:07.773 --> 35:09.541
You will?

35:09.608 --> 35:11.677
OK, um, in that case,
I'll have a pepperoni pizza,

35:11.743 --> 35:14.880
french fries, and cake,
ice cream, and lobster tails.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.047
Lots of lobster,
lots of seafood.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.650
Chicken fingers, french fries...

[Calvin Moaning]

35:25.457 --> 35:26.658
Ah, man.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.628
[Groans]

35:31.630 --> 35:33.165
Um, you know what?
Let me...

35:33.232 --> 35:34.733
I just want to clean up
just a little, OK?

35:34.800 --> 35:35.734
Well, that's OK.

35:35.801 --> 35:36.968
No. No. No. I just
want to clean up this--

35:37.035 --> 35:38.637

56:23.347 --> 56:25.783
Look, with all due respect,
Coach Wagner,

56:25.850 --> 56:28.218
child custody law
is very complex.

56:28.285 --> 56:29.954
Mr. Bittleman.

56:30.020 --> 56:32.457
Coach Wagner:
Just because you signed
his contractas his guardian...

56:32.523 --> 56:34.592
I'll call you back.
I'll call you back.

56:34.659 --> 56:36.060
Coach Wagner: Wait!
I'm not through talkin'--

56:36.126 --> 56:37.294
Yes, what is it, Calvin?

56:37.361 --> 56:38.696
You lied to me.

56:38.763 --> 56:39.897
What are you
talking about?

56:39.964 --> 56:41.832
You told me
no one can adopt me.

56:41.899 --> 56:43.734
I never said that.

56:53.444 --> 56:55.846
Look, Calvin,

56:55.913 --> 57:00.451
bear in mind
I have cared for you

57:00.518 --> 57:03.688
way before you were
rich or famous,

57:03.754 --> 57:05.556
and all of
those people in there,

57:05.623 --> 57:07.257
the only reason that
they're interested in you

57:07.324 --> 57:08.526
is because you're famous.

57:08.593 --> 57:10.427
I'd like
to see for myself.

57:10.495 --> 57:14.064
Well, that's fine.

57:14.131 --> 57:17.635
I will, um...

57:17.702 --> 57:20.738
make arrangements with
the very best candidates.

57:20.805 --> 57:22.840
What do you think
about that, my big man?

57:22.907 --> 57:26.143
We've been doing
musical dinner theater
now over 6 years

57:26.210 --> 57:28.813
in over 27 cities.
Mm-hmm.

57:28.879 --> 57:33.618
No more hard-knock life
for you, Calvin.

57:33.684 --> 57:38.523
* The sun'll come out
tomorrow *

57:38.589 --> 57:43.093
* Bet your bottom dollar
that tomorrow *

57:43.160 --> 57:45.429
* They'll be sun *

57:45.496 --> 57:47.532
We run a tight ship,
Cambridge!

57:47.598 --> 57:49.199
Roll call 0600!

57:49.266 --> 57:50.067
I think
you're gonna flip

57:50.134 --> 57:52.837
for my sugar-free
seaweed rice cream.

57:52.903 --> 57:55.172
* I just
stick out my chin *

57:55.239 --> 57:56.340
* And grin *

57:56.406 --> 57:57.542
All right,
good buddy.

57:57.608 --> 57:59.243
Now Denise here
will home school you

57:59.309 --> 58:01.111
'cause we're
on the road 24-7.

58:01.178 --> 58:02.346
* And I say *

58:02.412 --> 58:03.514
Ya, Ras Clap,

58:03.581 --> 58:05.382
ya have to come back
with me, ya seein'?

58:05.449 --> 58:07.818
* Tomorrow, tomorrow *

58:07.885 --> 58:09.687
How tall are you, boy?!
How tall are you?!

58:09.754 --> 58:11.355
You'll learn to hold
your bladder.

58:11.421 --> 58:13.457
* We love ya tomorrow *

58:13.524 --> 58:16.927
* You're only a day *

58:16.994 --> 58:20.230
* Away *

58:22.967 --> 58:24.569
You see, Calvin?

58:24.635 --> 58:27.504
You're best off here...

58:27.572 --> 58:28.973
with me.

58:37.281 --> 58:38.215
Hey, yo, Trace.

58:38.282 --> 58:39.216
Tracy: Hello?

58:39.283 --> 58:40.618
It's me, Calvin.

58:40.685 --> 58:41.952
Calvin. Wait.
You're here?

58:42.019 --> 58:43.353
Yeah, I'm here,

58:43.420 --> 58:44.321
and it took me
4 busses

58:44.388 --> 58:45.322
to get here, too.

58:45.389 --> 58:46.591
Uh, all right.

59:00.971 --> 59:03.741
Dang. Man, this is
where you live?

59:03.808 --> 59:05.009
Calvin, what are you
doing here?

59:05.075 --> 59:06.877
Hey, I just can't wait
to see the inside...

59:06.944 --> 59:08.278
Calvin.
of the house.

59:08.345 --> 59:09.914
Calvin, wait. Calvin.

59:09.980 --> 59:12.449
Come on, Calvin.
Tell me why you're here.

59:12.516 --> 59:15.419
Aw, this is tight.

59:15.485 --> 59:16.854
Look at all the stuff
you got, man.

59:16.921 --> 59:19.023
Yeah. Yeah, it's tight.

59:19.089 --> 59:20.858
So come on, man, tell me
what's up. Why you here?

59:20.925 --> 59:24.094
I wanna check
your place out.

59:24.161 --> 59:28.532
You know, just look at
your crib and everything.

59:28.599 --> 59:30.668
What do you call
this game?

59:30.735 --> 59:33.170
I have no idea.
It came with the house.

59:33.237 --> 59:34.639
Oh, man.

59:34.705 --> 59:36.173
So you're not gonna
tell me why you're here?

59:36.240 --> 59:38.976
We need one of these
at the orphanage.

59:39.043 --> 59:42.112
OK, OK. So I take it
you don't wanna tell me

59:42.179 --> 59:43.814
what's goin' on with you.
I understand.

59:43.881 --> 59:44.749
It's your prerogative.
That's cool.

59:44.815 --> 59:46.917
No, I mean,
nothin's goin' on.

59:46.984 --> 59:47.918
I mean,
everything's all right.

59:47.985 --> 59:49.219
Everything's
goin' real well.

59:49.286 --> 59:50.187
Everything's perfect.

59:50.254 --> 59:51.722
Uh, everything's, uh,

59:51.789 --> 59:53.057
you know, uh...

59:55.793 --> 59:57.127
All right, man.

59:57.194 --> 59:59.897
Everything's goin' real
terrible right about now.

59:59.964 --> 01:00:01.632
My best friend Murph,
he's mad at me.

01:00:01.699 --> 01:00:02.900
Bittleman lied to me.

01:00:02.967 --> 01:00:05.636
He set up the worst parents
in orphan history

01:00:05.703 --> 01:00:07.504
to come meet with me.

01:00:07.571 --> 01:00:08.939
And then, on top of that,

01:00:09.006 --> 01:00:12.042
I have a geometry test
tomorrow, and I hate geometry.

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:14.011
Mmm. All right,
well, listen,

01:00:14.078 --> 01:00:15.045
I'm sure
the right parents

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:16.513
are gonna show up
for you, OK?

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:17.648
It's just a question
of time,

01:00:17.715 --> 01:00:18.916
so you gotta have
a little faith.

01:00:18.983 --> 01:00:20.985
All right? But
in the meantime...

01:00:24.722 --> 01:00:25.823
call your boy Murph.

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:27.992
Right now?
Right now, yes.

01:00:28.058 --> 01:00:29.093
Good friends
are hard to come by,

01:00:29.159 --> 01:00:30.761
so you gotta keep things
straight with 'em.

01:00:30.828 --> 01:00:32.596
You have your
geometry work with you?

01:00:32.663 --> 01:00:34.031
Yeah.

01:00:34.098 --> 01:00:36.633
You know a little somethin'
about geometry?

01:00:36.701 --> 01:00:38.635
[Chuckles]
Do I know about geometry?

01:00:38.703 --> 01:00:41.205
Ha ha ha!
Do I know about geometry?

01:00:44.942 --> 01:00:46.610
Take-Take your time
on that call,

01:00:46.677 --> 01:00:48.512
and, um,
meet me outside.

01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:52.282
I gotta--I know geometry,
but let me...

01:00:58.789 --> 01:01:00.725
OK, now, the key to
the whole geometry thing

01:01:00.791 --> 01:01:02.359
and gettin' the hang
of these triangles is

01:01:02.426 --> 01:01:03.660
to super-size them.

01:01:03.728 --> 01:01:05.462
Super-size?
Super-size.

01:01:05.529 --> 01:01:06.596
You painted your house.

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:07.631
All right, look.
Tell me

01:01:07.698 --> 01:01:09.033
what triangle
this is right here.

01:01:09.099 --> 01:01:10.634
Um...

01:01:10.701 --> 01:01:13.037
I'm not familiar with
this one. I don't know.

01:01:13.103 --> 01:01:14.004
All right.
Let me give you a hint.

01:01:14.071 --> 01:01:15.039
So you got
MJ over there

01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:15.973
posting up a small
point guard, right?

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.607
You got Rodman
over there

01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:18.608
on the other side of
the court with his hair.

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:20.210
Now Pippin comes
to screen for Michael.

01:01:20.277 --> 01:01:21.411
So what do you got?

01:01:21.478 --> 01:01:23.613
Well, this is the Bulls'
triangle offense, right?

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:24.782
Right.
So we're just

01:01:24.849 --> 01:01:26.917
givin' room
for Michael to isolate.

01:01:26.984 --> 01:01:30.420
Isolate. Isosceles.
An isosceles triangle.

01:01:30.487 --> 01:01:31.521
Exactly.

01:01:31.588 --> 01:01:33.724
The Lakers use
this triangle offense.

01:01:33.791 --> 01:01:36.861
This triangle has equal sides
for Kobe and Shaq.

01:01:36.927 --> 01:01:40.664
Equal sides. OK. This is
an equilateral triangle.

01:01:40.731 --> 01:01:41.732
There you go.
See, you're gettin' it.

01:01:41.799 --> 01:01:43.500
You're gettin' it.
OK. OK.

01:01:43.567 --> 01:01:44.634
Uh, I got this.

01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:45.936
You got this one?

01:01:46.003 --> 01:01:47.104
OK, now this is us.
Uh-huh.

01:01:47.171 --> 01:01:49.106
And you know the type
of triangle offense we use

01:01:49.173 --> 01:01:51.341
is the acute offense. Well,
the acute triangle offense.

01:01:51.408 --> 01:01:52.743
OK.
That's because

01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:54.711
Calvin Cambridge
is so damn cute.

01:01:54.779 --> 01:01:56.213
Oh, man, give me a break.
I'm the cute one.

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.114
No, I am.
No, see.

01:01:57.181 --> 01:01:58.048
Look at the picture.
I'm the cute one.

01:01:58.115 --> 01:01:59.850
No.
OK, go ahead. Fine.

01:01:59.917 --> 01:02:01.919
All right. So...

01:02:01.986 --> 01:02:04.789
OK, see,
here's Joad, right?

01:02:04.855 --> 01:02:05.990
Right.
This is Joad.

01:02:06.056 --> 01:02:07.591
Joad's gonna
take the ball out.

01:02:07.657 --> 01:02:09.994
He's gonna pass
all the way to you.

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:11.762
OK.
You're right here.

01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:12.797
Right.
See me?

01:02:12.863 --> 01:02:14.231
I'm gonna be
headin' down court

01:02:14.298 --> 01:02:17.802
for the full-court lob pass
just like this, right?

01:02:17.868 --> 01:02:19.603
Oh, hey, Calvin.
Calvin.

01:02:19.669 --> 01:02:20.604
Don't put paint on
my windows, all right?

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:21.839
But I'm gonna be
wide open.

01:02:21.906 --> 01:02:22.840
You gotta
pass me the ball.

01:02:22.907 --> 01:02:24.574
I'm warning you,
all right? Don't do it.

01:02:24.641 --> 01:02:26.911
And then...

01:02:26.977 --> 01:02:29.814
Wham!
2 points for me

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.549
and the assist...

01:02:32.616 --> 01:02:33.617
to Reynolds.

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:35.419
Oh, OK. So you think
you're cute

01:02:35.485 --> 01:02:37.221
puttin' the paint and then
messin' up the house, huh?

01:02:37.287 --> 01:02:38.722
Well, let me
see what we've got.

01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:40.157
Let's say
if I went and did--

01:02:40.224 --> 01:02:42.827
Oh! Aw. Hey!

01:02:42.893 --> 01:02:44.694
Orange looks nice
on you, man.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:46.030
That's not funny.

01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:47.731
No, it really is funny
'cause it looks nice.

01:02:47.798 --> 01:02:48.598
It goes nice
with the blue, and...

01:02:48.665 --> 01:02:49.834
Oh, really?

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:51.902
Yeah. You kinda look
like a rainbow or--

01:02:51.969 --> 01:02:53.871
Well, the orange
looks really nice...

01:02:53.938 --> 01:02:54.771
Calvin, I know you're
not gonna do that.

01:02:54.839 --> 01:02:57.074
Oh!
on you!

01:02:57.141 --> 01:02:58.275
You really think
it's funny?

01:02:58.342 --> 01:03:00.244
No, no, no, no, no!

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:01.511
What are you doin'?
Cal. Calvin.

01:03:01.578 --> 01:03:02.913
Calvin. Whoa!

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:04.514
[Laughs]
Aah!

01:03:04.581 --> 01:03:06.483
[Buzzer]

01:03:11.755 --> 01:03:12.722
You must be Tracy.

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:13.958
You must be Murph.

01:03:14.024 --> 01:03:15.559
Yeah, that's me.

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:16.626
What's up, Murph?

01:03:16.693 --> 01:03:17.895
Hey, Cal.
You all right?

01:03:17.962 --> 01:03:18.929
Yeah, I'm pretty good.

01:03:18.996 --> 01:03:20.764
But can you believe
the cab ride here

01:03:20.831 --> 01:03:22.032
cost 50 bucks?

01:03:22.099 --> 01:03:23.533
You should have
took the bus.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.836
Tracy, can you
lend me 49.50?

01:03:25.903 --> 01:03:27.504
Heh. All right, Murph.

01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:29.173
I'll go get my wallet.

01:03:29.239 --> 01:03:31.775
So what have
you guys been up to?

01:03:31.842 --> 01:03:33.610
Geometry.

01:03:33.677 --> 01:03:35.279
Think you could teach me?

01:03:35.345 --> 01:03:37.948
* All I'm tryin' to do
is get my dough on *

01:03:38.015 --> 01:03:39.616
* I'm your boy,
you're my girlfriend *

01:03:39.683 --> 01:03:41.151
* Stop, hold up *

01:03:41.218 --> 01:03:44.154
* I ain't in no kind of rush
to grow up, so slow up *

01:03:44.221 --> 01:03:45.890
* I'm just playin' the game *

01:03:45.956 --> 01:03:46.924
* Let me warn you, girl *

01:03:46.991 --> 01:03:48.558
* Before you get rough with me *

01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:51.195
* You might think you got me
but you never really get me *

01:03:51.261 --> 01:03:54.064
* So don't trip if
you see me doin' my thing *

01:03:54.131 --> 01:03:55.332
* I told ya *

01:03:55.399 --> 01:03:56.300
* I'm just
playin' the game *

01:03:56.366 --> 01:03:57.534
* Yeah *

01:03:57.601 --> 01:03:59.169
* Playin' the game *

01:04:01.038 --> 01:04:04.208

We could still win,
coach.

01:23:13.389 --> 01:23:14.323
We can.

01:23:21.864 --> 01:23:22.998
Yeah! Yeah!

01:23:23.066 --> 01:23:25.034
Geoff:
Here come the Knights.

01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:52.061
Geoff: If I didn't see it
with my own eyes,

01:23:52.128 --> 01:23:53.462
I wouldn't have
believed it.

01:23:53.529 --> 01:23:56.965
But they're just one point
behind the Raptors in this game.

01:23:57.032 --> 01:23:58.601
We gotta steal the ball
on the inbound play.

01:23:58.667 --> 01:23:59.735
And if we don't
get the steal,

01:23:59.802 --> 01:24:00.636
who do we foul?

01:24:00.703 --> 01:24:02.605
They all shoot
good free throws, coach.

01:24:02.671 --> 01:24:05.141
Well, we better
get that steal. Ready?

01:24:05.208 --> 01:24:06.809
Players: Break!
Let's go.

01:24:08.477 --> 01:24:10.113
Geoff: The Knights
need a steal right here.

01:24:10.179 --> 01:24:11.780
Carter being guarded
by Cambridge.

01:24:11.847 --> 01:24:13.449
He comes in with it.
And he's got the ball--

01:24:13.516 --> 01:24:15.284
It's stolen by Cambridge!

01:24:15.351 --> 01:24:17.286
What a big play
by the little guy!

01:24:17.353 --> 01:24:18.987
[Whistle Blows]
Wagner: Time-out!

01:24:19.054 --> 01:24:20.256
Break!

01:24:20.323 --> 01:24:21.757
Geoff: Time-out called
by the Knights.

01:24:26.162 --> 01:24:27.563
[Whispers]
Oh, no.

01:24:29.298 --> 01:24:30.833
What's the matter?

01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:33.202
I'm done, Trace.

01:24:33.269 --> 01:24:35.204
What do you mean?

01:24:37.173 --> 01:24:39.108
It really wasn't me
that was playing.

01:24:39.175 --> 01:24:40.276
It was the sneakers.

01:24:40.343 --> 01:24:43.212
Tracy, the sneakers
were magic.

01:24:43.279 --> 01:24:45.281
Now they're gone.

01:24:49.918 --> 01:24:50.919
Come on, now. No.

01:24:50.986 --> 01:24:51.887
Now's not the time
for jokes, OK?

01:24:51.954 --> 01:24:54.690
I'm not playing games.

01:24:54.757 --> 01:24:56.225
Listen to me.

01:24:56.292 --> 01:24:57.393
We're gonna need you
to win,

01:24:57.460 --> 01:24:58.627
so you know
what you gotta do?

01:24:58.694 --> 01:25:00.863
You gotta be brave.

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:02.431
I believe in you.

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:07.536
Coach Wagner: All right.
Tracy inbounds to Calvin.

01:25:07.603 --> 01:25:09.037
Calvin, Joad's
gonna set you a pick.

01:25:09.104 --> 01:25:11.874
If they double-team you,
get the ball back to Tracy.

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.842
Listen, guys.

01:25:15.778 --> 01:25:17.380
Whether we make
the play-offs or not,

01:25:17.446 --> 01:25:19.682
it's gonna be
my last game.

01:25:19.748 --> 01:25:20.683
What?!
What?!

01:25:20.749 --> 01:25:22.418
Player: What are
you saying, man?

01:25:22.485 --> 01:25:24.653
I'm ready to be
a regular kid again.

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:27.156
It's what I want.

01:25:29.258 --> 01:25:31.460
Come on, y'all.
I got faith in you guys.

01:25:31.527 --> 01:25:33.362
Let's go out, and let's
go win this thing, man.

01:25:33.429 --> 01:25:35.898
Come on, now. Let's go.
Let's go, let's play.

01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:36.999
[Players Chanting]

01:25:37.065 --> 01:25:38.934
Teamwork on 3.
1...2...3...

01:25:39.001 --> 01:25:40.469
All: Teamwork!

01:25:40.536 --> 01:25:42.271
Geoff: Biggest moment of
the season for the Knights.

01:25:42.338 --> 01:25:43.506
It comes in to
Calvin Cambridge.

01:25:43.572 --> 01:25:45.341
The little guy
goes to the dribble

01:25:45.408 --> 01:25:46.475
against Vince Carter.

01:25:46.542 --> 01:25:47.410
Drives right,
the shake and bake--

01:25:47.476 --> 01:25:49.044
It didn't work this time!

01:25:49.111 --> 01:25:50.646
I can't do this.

01:25:50.713 --> 01:25:51.814
What are you doing?

01:26:06.595 --> 01:26:08.397
You can do it!

01:26:18.741 --> 01:26:20.443
Calvin: Shoot it!

01:26:22.177 --> 01:26:24.480
[Buzzer Sounds]

01:26:24.547 --> 01:26:25.548
Yeah!

01:26:25.614 --> 01:26:28.784
Geoff: The Knights win!
The Knights win!

01:26:28.851 --> 01:26:29.952
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:32.255
the Knights are going
to the NBA play-offs

01:26:32.321 --> 01:26:35.791
for the first time
in franchise history!

01:26:35.858 --> 01:26:37.660
Unbelievable!

01:26:58.113 --> 01:26:59.214
Yes!

01:26:59.282 --> 01:27:01.684
Play-offs, baby!

01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:04.987
We did it, man!

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:06.789
Yeah, man, we did.

01:27:06.855 --> 01:27:07.756
[Sighs]

01:27:14.530 --> 01:27:16.532
Guess I won't be
seeing you anymore?

01:27:16.599 --> 01:27:17.733
Hey, Trace,
come on, man.

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:19.568
The press wants to
see us, man. Come on.

01:27:19.635 --> 01:27:21.036
Oh, Calvin.

01:27:21.103 --> 01:27:22.838
Congratulations,
my dear.

01:27:22.905 --> 01:27:24.607
We're going to Le Cirque
to celebrate.

01:27:24.673 --> 01:27:25.941
You'll love
the French cooking.

01:27:26.008 --> 01:27:27.410
Oh, yes.
[Chuckles]

01:27:27.476 --> 01:27:29.545
Um, I'll meet you guys
outside at the car, OK?

01:27:29.612 --> 01:27:30.379
Oh, OK.

01:27:30.446 --> 01:27:31.547
All right, dear.

01:27:31.614 --> 01:27:32.581
We're so proud
of you.

01:27:32.648 --> 01:27:34.350
Wonderful,
just wonderful.

01:27:36.585 --> 01:27:37.920
Play-offs,
play-offs!

01:27:37.986 --> 01:27:39.988
Play-offs!
Yeah!

01:27:47.630 --> 01:27:50.165
Congratulations,
Calvin.

01:27:50.232 --> 01:27:51.534
I'm gonna miss you, coach.

01:27:52.601 --> 01:27:54.303
We're gonna
miss you, too.

01:27:54.370 --> 01:27:56.004
But I'm glad
you finally got

01:27:56.071 --> 01:27:57.540
what you really
needed.

01:27:57.606 --> 01:27:59.241
There'll always be
a place

01:27:59.308 --> 01:28:00.743
on this team
for you.

01:28:00.809 --> 01:28:02.345
Thanks, coach.

01:28:05.247 --> 01:28:06.349
Good luck.

01:28:41.450 --> 01:28:43.452
I wonder what's
keeping Calvin?

01:29:07.242 --> 01:29:08.544
Wow.

01:29:08.611 --> 01:29:10.946
Never thought you'd
turn down the Boyds.

01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:13.882
Me, neither.

01:29:15.584 --> 01:29:18.821
Somehow, it just
didn't feel right.

01:29:22.257 --> 01:29:23.692
Welcome back.

01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:25.961
Thanks, Murph.

01:29:27.362 --> 01:29:28.464
Come on.

01:29:39.475 --> 01:29:42.010
So, man...

01:29:42.077 --> 01:29:43.646
you gotta tell me.

01:29:43.712 --> 01:29:46.148
What was the best part

01:29:46.214 --> 01:29:47.382
about being in the NBA?

01:29:49.418 --> 01:29:50.819
Room service.

01:29:50.886 --> 01:29:53.456
Room service?

01:29:53.522 --> 01:29:54.590
What's room service?

01:29:54.657 --> 01:29:55.891
You're in your
hotel room.

01:29:55.958 --> 01:29:58.293
You pick up the phone,
you dial 6.

01:29:58.360 --> 01:29:59.962
Tell 'em what food
you want,

01:30:00.028 --> 01:30:01.464
they'll bring the food
up to your hotel room...

01:30:01.530 --> 01:30:03.966
for free.

01:30:04.032 --> 01:30:05.668
Nah. You're just--

01:30:05.734 --> 01:30:06.869
You're just messin'
with me, right?

01:30:06.935 --> 01:30:08.737
Nah, not at all.

01:30:10.439 --> 01:30:12.407
We should have that
around here sometime.

01:30:14.242 --> 01:30:16.144
We should.

01:30:16.211 --> 01:30:17.513
We should.

01:30:19.347 --> 01:30:20.749
Room service?

01:30:26.489 --> 01:30:27.956
[Softly]
Tracy.

01:30:28.023 --> 01:30:29.592
So now you're telling me

01:30:29.658 --> 01:30:32.561
that after everything that
we've been through together,

01:30:32.628 --> 01:30:34.797
that's what you like best?

01:30:34.863 --> 01:30:37.132
Room service?

01:30:37.199 --> 01:30:38.734
What are you
doing here?

01:30:43.238 --> 01:30:44.573
I'm here with the team.

01:30:46.174 --> 01:30:48.511
You see, the Knights are
sponsoring the home now.

01:30:51.313 --> 01:30:52.881
That's--
That's great.

01:30:57.953 --> 01:31:00.489
Guys, guys, uh,
a little to the left.

01:31:00.556 --> 01:31:01.590
How's that?

01:31:01.657 --> 01:31:03.792
That's good. Good.

01:31:03.859 --> 01:31:05.794
Reg, whatever happened
to the guy

01:31:05.861 --> 01:31:07.563
that used to run this place?
Bittleman?

01:31:07.630 --> 01:31:10.298
No one's seen him since
Calvin's last game.

01:31:10.365 --> 01:31:11.366
Something about a bet

01:31:11.433 --> 01:31:12.668
he didn't have
the money to cover.

01:31:20.242 --> 01:31:22.377
There's gonna be a lot
of changes around here.

01:31:22.444 --> 01:31:25.280
Yeah. I can
see that already.

01:31:25.347 --> 01:31:26.649
Yes.

01:31:26.715 --> 01:31:29.117
Yeah. Too bad you're not
gonna be around to enjoy it.

01:31:29.184 --> 01:31:31.186
What do you mean?

01:31:31.253 --> 01:31:34.690
Well, things are going
great with the team now.

01:31:34.757 --> 01:31:37.392
Everything's going well
with my father.

01:31:37.459 --> 01:31:39.795
I have furniture
in the house,

01:31:39.862 --> 01:31:41.797
but still
something's missing.

01:31:43.932 --> 01:31:45.534
And I heard it
through the grapevine

01:31:45.601 --> 01:31:46.969
that you're still
looking for a father.

01:31:48.270 --> 01:31:49.237
Yeah.

01:31:49.304 --> 01:31:50.205
Yeah?

01:31:54.209 --> 01:31:55.711
That's great.

01:31:57.613 --> 01:32:00.048
Because what I'm missing
is a son.

01:32:18.567 --> 01:32:20.936
Thanks...Dad.

01:32:23.505 --> 01:32:24.840
Murph!

01:32:24.907 --> 01:32:26.074
Hey, Murph,
come here.

01:32:29.444 --> 01:32:31.246
Um, you know what
today is, right?

01:32:31.313 --> 01:32:32.347
What?

01:32:32.414 --> 01:32:33.448
It's 2-for-1
orphan day.

01:32:33.515 --> 01:32:34.917
You take one orphan,

01:32:34.983 --> 01:32:37.285
and then you get
another one.

01:32:37.352 --> 01:32:40.455
2-for-1 orphan day.

01:32:40.522 --> 01:32:43.926
I mean, if that's OK
with you.

01:32:43.992 --> 01:32:45.427
Hey, Murph.

01:32:45.493 --> 01:32:46.829
Hey, T-time.

01:32:46.895 --> 01:32:49.164
You know, I'm gonna take
Calvin home with me today.

01:32:50.298 --> 01:32:53.035
Congratulations.

01:32:53.101 --> 01:32:54.102
Thanks.

01:32:54.169 --> 01:32:55.070
But you know what?

01:32:55.137 --> 01:32:57.973
We were kinda hoping
that you'd come, too.

01:32:59.708 --> 01:33:00.843
You mean...

01:33:00.909 --> 01:33:03.411
Murph,
we're going home.

01:33:03.478 --> 01:33:04.847
We're going home!

01:33:06.548 --> 01:33:07.582
Yeah.

01:33:07.650 --> 01:33:09.284
That's right,
we're going home.

01:33:09.351 --> 01:33:10.385
Yeah.
Dad?

01:33:10.452 --> 01:33:11.887
Can we get
an allowance?

01:33:11.954 --> 01:33:12.788
Allowance?

01:33:12.855 --> 01:33:13.956
Yeah. Can I drive
the Escalade home?

01:33:14.022 --> 01:33:14.957
You wanna drive
the what?

01:33:15.023 --> 01:33:16.191
Do we get
season tickets?

01:33:16.258 --> 01:33:17.559
Tracy: Whoo! Ha ha!

01:33:17.626 --> 01:33:19.728

01:33:37.145 --> 01:33:39.114
All right, let's get
some sleep, guys.

01:33:39.181 --> 01:33:40.248
Here you go.

01:33:43.752 --> 01:33:45.320
All right.
Good night, guys.

01:33:45.387 --> 01:33:46.755
Good night, Dad.

01:33:46.822 --> 01:33:48.323
Good night, Dad.

01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:49.792
Hey, you want me to leave
the light on for you?

01:33:52.795 --> 01:33:54.830
Nah, I'm cool.

[Woof Woof]
Ha ha!

01:34:21.523 --> 01:34:23.091
How was that?

01:34:23.158 --> 01:34:24.326
Which way?
