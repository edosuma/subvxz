00:10.343 --> 00:13.512
<i>Remember,
they won't hear me,</i>

00:13.514 --> 00:16.047
<i>so if you could</i>
<i>answer the questions</i>
<i>in complete sentences.</i>

00:16.050 --> 00:17.349
<i>"I built the maze because?"</i>

00:17.351 --> 00:19.618
<i>I built
the maze because</i>

00:19.620 --> 00:21.420
<i>I wanted to make something.</i>

00:21.422 --> 00:22.454
<i>- And?
- Oh, god.</i>

00:22.456 --> 00:24.356
<i>Am I coming off angry?</i>

00:24.358 --> 00:27.159
<i>Just please don't let me
come across angry on this.</i>

00:27.161 --> 00:30.262
- Don't... or spineless. Please.
- Of course not.

00:30.264 --> 00:34.266
If... for fuck's sake,
do not make me look like
a spineless asshole.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.201
Of course not. Boom.

00:38.471 --> 00:42.408
I built something because
I wanted to build something.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.611
And if I could just finish it,

00:45.613 --> 00:50.783
I just know that it would...
It would be great. It would...

00:50.785 --> 00:54.053
Or true, or real.

00:54.055 --> 00:57.222
And tertiary, tertiary,

00:57.224 --> 01:00.793
I might be responsible for
the people that died yesterday

01:00.795 --> 01:04.196
or today, I don't know
what time it is.

01:07.367 --> 01:08.367
And if I am,

01:12.539 --> 01:14.440
then I'm sorry.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.075
Tertiarily.

01:16.077 --> 01:18.577
Tell me more about that.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.512
Dave, don't go.
A few more questions.

02:39.459 --> 02:40.459
Hey.

02:42.362 --> 02:43.362
I'm back!

02:45.365 --> 02:47.766
- What the...
- Hey, baby!

02:47.768 --> 02:49.801
Welcome home!

02:49.803 --> 02:51.703
How was your trip?

02:51.705 --> 02:52.705
Um...

02:53.706 --> 02:54.706
It was fine.

02:55.708 --> 02:56.742
What is this?

02:56.744 --> 02:58.744
I built a labyrinth!

02:58.746 --> 02:59.811
Can you believe it?

02:59.813 --> 03:01.446
Ok.

03:01.448 --> 03:04.917
Um, how long are you planning
on having it up?

03:04.919 --> 03:08.754
Oh, you know,
just a little while.

03:10.290 --> 03:11.356
Ok.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.192
I'm going to take a shower.

03:13.194 --> 03:14.326
Cool.

03:15.762 --> 03:16.929
Cool.

03:16.931 --> 03:18.263
Wait!

03:18.265 --> 03:19.331
Annie!

03:19.333 --> 03:20.666
What?

03:20.668 --> 03:24.336
Annie,
I'm so glad you're home.

03:26.606 --> 03:28.941
Ok.

03:40.520 --> 03:43.789
Tsk, tsk, tsk... all right.

03:46.593 --> 03:48.660
Have you been working
on this all weekend?

03:48.662 --> 03:50.329
- Hey!
- Hey.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.364
Um, yes.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.900
Well, I started
Friday night and...

03:56.603 --> 03:58.437
I'm lost.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.439
Um, it's cardboard.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.541
I know,
but it's much bigger
on the inside.

04:04.477 --> 04:07.846
I really want to see you.
Can you please come out?

04:07.848 --> 04:09.681
Annie.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.316
I'm lost.

04:11.318 --> 04:13.885
Dude, come out.
They're just refrigerator boxes.

04:13.887 --> 04:15.554
Knock 'em over.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.923
Do you even know how long
it took me to make this?

04:17.925 --> 04:20.625
You can't just make me
tear it down because it works.

04:24.931 --> 04:26.431
Where's the entrance?

04:26.433 --> 04:28.634
No!
Annie, do not come in here.

04:28.636 --> 04:31.403
It is not finished
and it is way too dangerous.

04:31.405 --> 04:32.638
Dave, you're being a douche.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.474
No, what are you doing?
Stop it!

04:35.476 --> 04:36.441
Oh, my god!

04:36.443 --> 04:37.709
Whoa!

04:37.711 --> 04:39.611
What is happening?

04:39.613 --> 04:42.314
Whatever you just did,
please don't do that again.

04:42.316 --> 04:43.882
I'm coming in.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.551
No, it's not ready!

04:46.553 --> 04:48.387
I don't want you to get lost.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.389
How long have you been in there?

04:51.824 --> 04:53.492
I've been in here
for three days.

04:53.494 --> 04:54.494
What?

04:55.728 --> 04:57.562
Are you kidding me?

04:57.564 --> 05:00.699
I left my phone
on the counter,
or I would have called.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.668
I really wanted to call.

05:03.936 --> 05:06.004
Oh, my god.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.878
- I'm breaking it down.
- No, no, no, wait!

05:12.880 --> 05:14.846
There has to be a way!

05:14.848 --> 05:15.881
Call Gordon!

05:15.883 --> 05:18.050
No, call Leonard!

05:18.052 --> 05:21.019
- No, call Gordon.
- Are you serious?

05:21.021 --> 05:22.621
Yes, Annie, please.

05:22.623 --> 05:26.491
Just, I've worked
so hard on this.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.035
Hey, Gordon.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.737
Hello.

05:38.739 --> 05:39.938
Where's that beard at?

05:39.940 --> 05:41.473
The beard's on my face!

05:41.475 --> 05:42.674
I said
where's that beard at?

05:42.676 --> 05:44.376
I said the beard's on my face!

05:44.378 --> 05:46.545
- What you say?
- I said the beard's on my face!

05:47.714 --> 05:49.348
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.717
- Sorry I didn't call.
- Ok.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.585
I thought you were dead
in a closet
with a bag over your head.

05:53.587 --> 05:56.121
Ha.
Did Annie explain?

05:56.123 --> 05:57.622
Yeah, she did.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.359
Why aren't we
breaking this down?

06:00.361 --> 06:02.627
Because he worked
really hard on it.

06:02.629 --> 06:04.796
Thank you. Yes.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.365
Let's see what we've got here.

06:06.367 --> 06:07.632
Dave,
are you wearing your shoes?

06:07.634 --> 06:08.900
No.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.635
No, of course not.

06:10.637 --> 06:11.637
Mm-hmm.

06:14.006 --> 06:15.707
We're not allowed to go in.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.142
Yeah, because
it's not finished yet.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.744
He's afraid that
we'll get lost.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.045
Which is right

06:20.047 --> 06:21.780
because it's bigger
than it looks.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.482
I can't believe
you actually made this.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.150
Well, it's not finished yet.

06:25.152 --> 06:27.085
But pretty cool, huh?

06:27.087 --> 06:30.021
The interesting thing is
that I started in the center

06:30.023 --> 06:32.524
and built outward,
like a seashell.

06:32.526 --> 06:35.060
The interesting thing
is that you got lost.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.928
I said
where's that beard at?

06:36.930 --> 06:38.430
The beard's on my face!

06:38.432 --> 06:39.631
Annie, can I get a jar?

06:52.011 --> 06:53.545
Come in, Gordon.

06:53.547 --> 06:54.880
Hey.

06:57.116 --> 06:59.151
What's wrong with him?

06:59.153 --> 07:02.454
Um, you know, he gets
all fired up about stuff,

07:02.456 --> 07:04.055
but he never finishes anything.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.725
At least
he followed through
this time. You know?

07:06.727 --> 07:10.495
Come on, look at
half this stuff out here,
it's a mess.

07:10.497 --> 07:12.531
You know you're the one
that's going to have
to clean up all this cardboard

07:12.533 --> 07:13.533
once he takes up,

07:16.803 --> 07:17.836
carpentry.

07:27.213 --> 07:29.080
You ok?

07:29.082 --> 07:31.183
I'm fine.

07:31.185 --> 07:33.452
He's lost in
a cardboard maze
in our living room.

07:33.454 --> 07:35.554
Not true.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.489
He's lost in a cardboard maze
in your living room

07:37.491 --> 07:39.958
that he built.
It's way stupider.

07:41.994 --> 07:43.895
- Thanks.
- Hmm.

07:45.598 --> 07:48.600
He said he's been in there
for three days.

07:48.602 --> 07:49.768
Where do you think
he poops and stuff?

07:49.770 --> 07:51.536
I...

07:51.538 --> 07:53.238
I haven't had
anything to eat for a while.

07:55.741 --> 07:56.842
What?

07:56.844 --> 07:58.510
You haven't eaten anything?

07:58.512 --> 08:01.112
I had some trail mix,
a little beef jerky,

08:01.114 --> 08:03.815
you know, construction food.
But that was a while ago.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.917
And I didn't build a toilet,

08:05.919 --> 08:07.719
and I'm not going to shit
on our floor!

08:07.721 --> 08:09.721
- Are you ok?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

08:09.723 --> 08:12.924
I just, I kinda hurt my hand.

08:12.926 --> 08:13.992
Let me guess, paper cut?

08:13.994 --> 08:15.694
Yeah, kind of.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.095
Is it bad?
Are you all right?

08:17.097 --> 08:19.164
No, it's fine.
I'm fine.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.699
Don't worry, guys.

08:20.701 --> 08:23.001
Hey, I think
it's time we lift it up

08:23.003 --> 08:24.102
and you crawl out.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.137
What am I, a worm?

08:27.874 --> 08:29.708
And I can't, because
I taped it to the carpet.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.009
You're kidding.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.544
It's sealed tight.

08:32.546 --> 08:33.678
Wait, let me just...

08:35.081 --> 08:36.914
Jesus Christ!

08:36.917 --> 08:38.283
Stop!

08:38.284 --> 08:39.751
What are you even doing?

08:39.753 --> 08:41.219
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.221
Please don't do that.

08:43.222 --> 08:44.222
Ok.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.959
Oh, my god!

08:47.961 --> 08:49.961
I can hear that!
Gordon, keep knocking!

08:53.165 --> 08:54.666
Why did I not think of this?

08:54.668 --> 08:56.902
So simple!
Keep knocking, Gordon!

08:56.904 --> 08:58.136
Knock away, baby!

09:00.172 --> 09:06.077
Yeah! Wait.
Oh, shit. Gordon?
I can't hear you knocking.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.948
I've gone too far.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.316
Nah, I was just kidding.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.152
- Awesome.
- What?

09:14.154 --> 09:16.955
I'm lost again.

09:16.957 --> 09:19.658
Just, follow the knocking.

09:19.660 --> 09:20.859
I wish
it was that easy.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.227
I built this thing too tricky.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.029
What are we supposed to do?

09:24.031 --> 09:27.232
Ooh!
Make sandwiches, put them in baggies.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.900
And then throw them into
the labyrinth, yeah,

09:28.902 --> 09:30.835
and then hopefully
I'll find one.

09:30.837 --> 09:33.004
This is really good.
I'm gonna call
Leonard real fast.

09:33.006 --> 09:35.140
Dave.
Can you please come out?

09:35.142 --> 09:40.045
Annie,
I want to,
I just, I can't.

09:40.047 --> 09:43.081
Dave is trapped in a cardboard
maze in his living room

09:43.083 --> 09:45.283
and he can't get out.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.354
No, no bag, no closet, just.

09:49.356 --> 09:50.789
Yeah, Annie just came home
and found him,

09:50.791 --> 09:52.624
no, no, no,
Gordon? Gordon!

09:52.626 --> 09:54.593
Hold on a sec, Leo.
What?

09:54.595 --> 09:56.127
Only Leonard.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.963
Only Leonard.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.731
You got me?

09:59.733 --> 10:01.333
Yes, of course.

10:07.373 --> 10:08.807
You ok?

10:08.809 --> 10:09.841
Yeah, I'm fine.

10:09.843 --> 10:12.243
Just... kinda hungry.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.845
And we can't tear it down?

10:13.847 --> 10:15.347
Please don't.

10:15.349 --> 10:16.881
- Let's go get him.
- No, you can't.

10:17.917 --> 10:19.618
It's too dangerous.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.252
You wouldn't last a second
with the obstacles

10:21.254 --> 10:23.388
- and the booby traps...
- You built obstacles?

10:23.390 --> 10:24.856
Yeah, just for fun,

10:24.858 --> 10:26.891
and they took on
a life of their own.

10:26.893 --> 10:28.927
And they're not what I intended.

10:28.929 --> 10:31.863
So we can't tear it down,
and we can't go in?

10:31.865 --> 10:33.765
I'm going home.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.834
No, no, come on,
you just got here.
Let's hang out.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.135
I've gotta work tomorrow.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.037
Well, you've got
awesome right now!

10:39.039 --> 10:40.071
Sorry.
Bye, Dave.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.940
Bye, Leonard!

10:41.942 --> 10:45.043
Leonard, can I get
a few words from you
before you go?

10:45.045 --> 10:46.077
Ok.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.746
Cock, radio, porcelain,

10:47.748 --> 10:48.747
an interview.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.215
Wait, was that Harry?

10:50.217 --> 10:52.150
Yeah, he's making
a documentary.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.251
Oh.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.153
Did he see the labyrinth yet?

10:55.155 --> 10:56.821
Nope.
Probably missed it.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.357
Come on, guys!
It's huge!

10:59.359 --> 11:00.925
Wait, who else is out there?

11:00.927 --> 11:02.761
Me, Gordon, Harry.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.696
Uh, Harry's crew.
Greg and Brynn are here.

11:04.698 --> 11:06.097
Hey, Dave.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.099
Can you not say that
at the same time as me?

11:08.101 --> 11:09.300
What?

11:09.302 --> 11:10.702
- You know...
- Hey, guys.

11:10.704 --> 11:12.037
Hey, Dave.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.406
- Damn it.
- Gordon, what the fuck?

11:14.408 --> 11:16.941
Nicole couldn't make it,
but Jane is here.

11:16.943 --> 11:18.810
I want to go inside!
Can we go inside?

11:18.812 --> 11:21.212
- What? No!
- Ok.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.948
I don't understand,
why can't he just
break out of it?

11:23.950 --> 11:26.284
Because he's attached to it.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.318
Huh.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.020
Yeah, ok.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.122
Ok, well, don't just
let anyone in, ok?

11:31.124 --> 11:33.091
Yeah, there's some
Flemish tourists,

11:36.128 --> 11:37.762
hobo from the street.

11:37.764 --> 11:39.698
- Can I use the shower?
- Gordon!

11:39.700 --> 11:41.866
Look, buddy, you said
you knew mazes.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.902
I said I know cardboard.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.470
- Pizza's here.
- More cardboard.

11:45.472 --> 11:48.973
Oh, you guys
got some pizza.

11:48.975 --> 11:49.975
- Annie?
- What?

11:51.844 --> 11:55.280
Can you come back
to the back of
the labyrinth, please?

11:55.282 --> 11:56.314
I can't.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.183
I have to get the pizza.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.184
Please?

11:59.186 --> 12:00.452
I'll get it.

12:00.454 --> 12:01.820
I'll get it.

12:07.827 --> 12:09.494
What?

12:09.496 --> 12:12.130
I'm sorry I can't
figure my way out of here.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.899
I feel like a fish
in a fishbowl.

12:14.901 --> 12:17.135
Everything is so close.

12:18.871 --> 12:20.438
I'm really sorry.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.440
Ok.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.776
Ok what?

12:24.778 --> 12:26.144
You sound pissed.

12:28.047 --> 12:29.314
This is stupid.

12:30.382 --> 12:33.184
Not from in here.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.285
I miss you.

12:43.395 --> 12:44.929
I miss you, too.

13:01.213 --> 13:02.914
<i>Ok, that's great.
Can we try another one?</i>

13:02.916 --> 13:04.549
Ok, I got one.

13:04.551 --> 13:09.120
Um, when I first heard about
Dave being trapped in a maze,

13:09.122 --> 13:10.455
I was like, well,
at least he's not sucking

13:10.457 --> 13:13.424
a big veiny dick
for kickstarter money.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.560
That's not how
kickstarter works!

13:17.429 --> 13:18.797
- Hi.
- Oh, hey.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.532
Why didn't we start with Annie?

13:20.534 --> 13:22.500
- I'm going into the maze.
- Really? Ok.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.803
- Don't touch me!
- I'm sorry.

13:24.805 --> 13:27.806
You're good.
We're gonna pick up
later, where we left off.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.374
Ok, thank you, Leonard.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.943
Ok, Annie, you come home,

13:31.945 --> 13:33.444
there's a giant maze
in your living room,

13:33.446 --> 13:35.113
you're like, what the...

13:35.115 --> 13:37.148
There's a giant maze
in my living room!

13:37.150 --> 13:38.883
I've heard of people
rearranging the furniture,

13:38.885 --> 13:41.386
but this is
whack-a-doodle crazy!

13:42.888 --> 13:45.824
You give me a sense of that.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.525
So when you're ready.
Just let me know how you felt.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.594
Put it in your own words.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.896
Don't say whack-a-doodle.
That's dumb.

13:51.898 --> 13:53.331
When you're ready,

13:53.333 --> 13:55.500
ok, just ignore me,
do what you're doing.

13:55.502 --> 13:58.369
We'll put some music over this,
it'll be a montage,
it'll be awesome!

14:08.480 --> 14:10.448
Um, can we go
in the maze now?

14:10.450 --> 14:12.116
Yeah, can we go
in the maze now?

14:12.118 --> 14:14.219
What?
No, guys, I'm just
going to fish Dave out.

14:14.221 --> 14:15.486
This is not...

14:15.488 --> 14:17.388
- So we can go in the maze now?
- Yes!

14:17.390 --> 14:18.423
Let's fucking do this!

14:19.426 --> 14:20.458
Whoa.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.160
What, stop it, guys, stop it!

14:22.162 --> 14:23.561
- It's not finished!
- I'll be right there.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.630
- What's going on?
- We're coming in.

14:25.632 --> 14:28.066
You're not coming in, are you?

14:28.068 --> 14:30.368
- Fuck it, let's go.
- Stop!

14:30.370 --> 14:33.271
Go, go, go!
Don't look at the camera,
don't look at the camera.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.340
Don't look at the camera!
Go, go, go, go through.

14:36.408 --> 14:38.243
Whoa! My god!

14:38.245 --> 14:40.511
Let's go this way.

14:43.984 --> 14:44.984
Dave?

14:51.156 --> 14:52.490
Maybe this way.

14:52.492 --> 14:53.992
It is bigger.

15:02.568 --> 15:05.136
- It goes down.
- This doesn't make any sense.

15:24.223 --> 15:25.223
Ow!

15:31.063 --> 15:32.497
No problem.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.599
We're gonna...
We'll just turn around.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.968
As long a we're all
working together,
this is gonna be fine.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.703
- It's gonna be great.
- Which way?

15:38.705 --> 15:40.605
- Um, wait a second. Hold on.
- What's wrong?

15:40.607 --> 15:42.206
Nothing, hold on,
just give me a second.

15:42.208 --> 15:43.641
No, come on.

15:43.643 --> 15:44.643
Dave!

15:46.312 --> 15:48.613
Hey, hey, not on me,
on the maze. The maze!

16:03.595 --> 16:04.595
Dave?

16:09.568 --> 16:11.602
- Acoustics are different.
- Is that a problem?

16:11.604 --> 16:13.171
Are you bringing
problems to my set?

16:13.173 --> 16:14.639
You're here to provide
solutions, not problems.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.641
- It's just different.
- Dave!

16:18.544 --> 16:20.645
Ok, look, mazes
are very complicated.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.214
Let's just take
a second and relax.

16:23.216 --> 16:24.549
We don't need to
go and get lost.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.084
We just got here.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.019
Every maze has a dead end.

16:28.021 --> 16:30.088
It's just a shame that
we had to find one so soon.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.390
- Look at that.
- What is happening to you?

16:32.392 --> 16:34.125
You're freaking out.

16:34.127 --> 16:37.528
So let's just take a second
and have a breather.

16:37.530 --> 16:38.663
No, don't!

16:38.665 --> 16:40.598
Oh!

17:02.454 --> 17:05.623
This must have taken hours.

17:05.625 --> 17:06.758
It goes all the way up.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.660
Wait, isn't this
the keyboard that you got Dave?

17:42.662 --> 17:44.128
Yep.

17:44.130 --> 17:46.464
At least the box
is being used, huh?

17:48.367 --> 17:50.535
He really used
anything he could find.

17:50.537 --> 17:53.071
Where's the keyboard?

18:15.427 --> 18:16.427
Annie?

18:26.105 --> 18:27.171
- Hey!
- Hey.

18:58.537 --> 19:01.372
Dave? Dave!
Guys, come on!

19:16.155 --> 19:17.155
Whoa.

19:27.666 --> 19:28.766
No, it's fine.

19:49.254 --> 19:50.254
Annie!

19:50.256 --> 19:52.823
More childlike wonder.

19:52.825 --> 19:53.825
Ooh!

19:56.228 --> 19:57.295
Ooh.

20:03.335 --> 20:04.635
Wow.

20:11.843 --> 20:13.678
Why are we stopping?

20:14.846 --> 20:16.781
Where's the second one?

20:19.418 --> 20:21.719
Whoa!

20:32.931 --> 20:34.365
There's gotta be
another way out!

20:45.577 --> 20:47.478
Guys!
Get in the mouth!

20:48.714 --> 20:49.981
Go! Come on!

21:05.297 --> 21:06.831
I got it!

21:06.833 --> 21:11.535
When I first heard about Dave
being trapped in a maze, um...

21:18.510 --> 21:19.510
Seriously.

21:21.046 --> 21:22.880
Yeah, Annie,
could you sit there?

21:22.882 --> 21:27.652
Annie, just, ok, there we go.

21:29.021 --> 21:30.521
Just sit there. Ok.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.523
Yeah. All right.

21:32.525 --> 21:34.692
This is
pretty overwhelming, huh?
Let's talk about this.

21:34.694 --> 21:35.694
Yeah, I guess.

21:37.829 --> 21:40.331
- Probably talk about...
- Ok, let's start with Annie.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.967
Thank you, Gordon. All right.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.835
Hold this for a second.

21:46.505 --> 21:48.873
And I see that she keys left.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.742
Do you have a bounce?
I'd like to get some fill on
the other side of her face...

21:51.744 --> 21:56.314
We're here in the maze
and we're rescuing Dave.

21:56.316 --> 21:58.749
Great, hold on,
hold that thought. Not yet.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.017
Good instincts.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.986
Ok, so, Annie,

22:04.489 --> 22:05.856
start with your name and age.

22:05.858 --> 22:08.826
My name's Annie,
and we're rescuing Dave.

22:08.828 --> 22:09.860
From the maze.

22:09.862 --> 22:11.395
Ok, Annie,

22:12.964 --> 22:15.333
when did Dave become able to
bring inanimate objects to life?

22:15.335 --> 22:16.901
What?

22:16.903 --> 22:18.803
We were just attacked
by giant origami birds.

22:18.805 --> 22:20.438
Your thoughts?

22:20.440 --> 22:22.039
I don't know.
What are your thoughts?

22:24.443 --> 22:26.644
Often in the media,

22:26.646 --> 22:29.080
women are portrayed as
incomplete without a man,

22:29.082 --> 22:30.614
either talking about a guy,

22:30.616 --> 22:32.983
or in this case
physically searching for a guy.

22:32.985 --> 22:34.719
-What do you think about that?

22:34.721 --> 22:37.488
What? I really don't care.

22:37.490 --> 22:39.924
You don't care?
You're a woman, you don't care
about gender stereotypes?

22:39.926 --> 22:41.125
What are you,
Betty Friedan?

22:41.127 --> 22:42.660
Let's just keep it
about the maze.

22:42.662 --> 22:44.595
You want me
to minimize her as a person

22:44.597 --> 22:47.665
and just allow her identity
through a gender telescope fine!

22:47.667 --> 22:49.734
- I want us to stay focused!
- You want me to stay focused?

22:49.736 --> 22:51.035
Annie!

22:53.705 --> 22:55.473
Is Dave important to you?

22:55.475 --> 22:58.142
What would you do if
something happened to him?

23:04.483 --> 23:06.550
- I...
- Hey, you guys!

23:07.553 --> 23:11.622
This place is huge.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.023
Jane, did you see
anything back there?

23:13.025 --> 23:14.992
No, I didn't see anything.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.660
This is a blast, huh?

23:16.662 --> 23:17.661
Hold on, hold on.

23:17.663 --> 23:18.662
Have you seen any of the other...

23:18.664 --> 23:19.764
No, don't move!

23:31.843 --> 23:32.943
Ok.

23:32.945 --> 23:35.179
Look at me, I'm like a statue!

23:35.181 --> 23:36.614
Why am I not moving, Annie?

23:38.417 --> 23:40.818
Uh, Jane,
just listen to him,

23:42.120 --> 23:44.455
you might have triggered
a booby trap.

23:44.457 --> 23:46.056
Booby trap?

23:51.563 --> 23:52.883
No... no one else
stepped on this?

23:54.433 --> 23:56.834
It's like a fucking
cocktail party in here,

23:56.836 --> 23:58.602
and nobody stepped on this?

23:58.604 --> 23:59.604
Shh!

24:06.044 --> 24:07.144
Ok. I think we're good.

24:07.146 --> 24:08.813
Oh.

24:26.164 --> 24:27.164
What?

24:33.572 --> 24:35.606
- What the hell is this?
- Is this blood?

24:35.608 --> 24:37.174
Is this my good yarn?

24:37.176 --> 24:40.544
Did she die, or did she just
turn into a craft project?

24:40.546 --> 24:44.849
Her head fell off,
so I'm gonna say that,
she's dead?

24:44.851 --> 24:46.116
I don't know!

24:46.118 --> 24:47.618
Greg!

25:00.999 --> 25:02.967
You're getting so cold.

25:08.707 --> 25:10.908
I'm coming to get you, Brynn!

25:21.186 --> 25:22.186
Greg?

25:33.832 --> 25:34.865
I can hear you.

25:47.045 --> 25:48.078
Greg?

26:04.896 --> 26:07.197
Why did Dave build booby traps?

26:07.199 --> 26:09.033
Because it's a labyrinth!
If it didn't have booby traps,

26:09.035 --> 26:10.668
it would just be a series
of articulated hallways.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.102
I don't care what it is.

26:12.104 --> 26:14.004
I want to know why
it's killing people!

26:14.006 --> 26:15.739
Ok, that's great,

26:15.741 --> 26:17.708
but could you rephrase that
to more directly address

26:17.710 --> 26:19.190
whether
what's happening here is real?

26:20.246 --> 26:22.212
I want to get out of here!

26:22.214 --> 26:23.747
Brynn! Are you ok?

26:23.749 --> 26:25.082
No, I am not ok!

26:25.084 --> 26:27.017
I want to get out
of this stupid maze.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.019
Stop.

26:29.354 --> 26:31.855
Hey, um...
You look nice, how are you?

26:31.857 --> 26:35.192
- What?
- More of a...

26:35.194 --> 26:38.329
Look, uh, we don't have time
for this, Brynn!

26:38.331 --> 26:41.131
We are trapped inside
some sort of a death maze,

26:41.133 --> 26:43.734
and we need to find our friends
and get the fuck out of here!

26:43.736 --> 26:45.269
Ok, why are you shaking me?

26:45.271 --> 26:48.606
I am shaking you because
I am brimming with emotion!

26:48.608 --> 26:49.807
Get it together, Gordon!

26:49.809 --> 26:50.841
Ok, enough.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.843
Brynn, what happened?

26:52.845 --> 26:56.313
A bunch of spikes hit Greg
and his guts
splashed all over me.

26:56.315 --> 26:57.315
Ok.

26:58.883 --> 27:00.250
Ok.

27:00.252 --> 27:02.252
We have to know what
we're dealing with here.

27:04.756 --> 27:06.223
- I don't know what that is.
- Hug her.

27:06.225 --> 27:08.192
- Give her a hug.
- No, come on.

27:08.194 --> 27:09.927
Follow them.

27:09.929 --> 27:11.962
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

27:30.415 --> 27:31.415
He was right there.

27:34.919 --> 27:37.655
Could he have gotten up?
Maybe he was just hurt.

27:37.657 --> 27:38.657
He was definitely hurt.

27:40.158 --> 27:43.193
It looks like he got up
and wandered off.

27:43.195 --> 27:45.963
If he had paint cans for feet.
What am I looking at?

27:45.965 --> 27:47.164
Hooves.

27:49.234 --> 27:50.701
It's a minotaur.

27:50.703 --> 27:52.436
Um, what?

27:52.438 --> 27:54.405
Half bull, half man.

27:54.407 --> 27:56.874
Feeds on human flesh,
haunts labyrinths.

27:56.876 --> 27:59.977
Are you telling me that Dave
is killing and eating people?

27:59.979 --> 28:01.111
No, the traps
are killing people

28:01.113 --> 28:02.946
and the minotaur is eating them.

28:02.948 --> 28:05.049
Ok, but if
Dave made the minotaur,

28:05.051 --> 28:06.784
couldn't he just
tell it to stop?

28:06.786 --> 28:08.686
How do you make a minotaur?

28:09.954 --> 28:11.055
I don't know.

28:17.262 --> 28:18.262
Ok, that's it.

28:20.098 --> 28:23.033
I'm cutting a hole
all the way to the outside.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.868
No, no, Annie,
Dave said that we shouldn't.

28:27.239 --> 28:29.173
Well, he's gonna get over it.

28:29.175 --> 28:30.808
It's the least of his concerns.

28:35.080 --> 28:36.346
Annie?

28:36.348 --> 28:38.182
Annie, Annie!
You gotta hurry up!

28:38.184 --> 28:39.383
It's rough.

28:39.385 --> 28:40.818
Annie, we gotta
get out of here!

28:40.820 --> 28:42.086
I'm almost done!

28:43.354 --> 28:44.388
Annie!

28:48.294 --> 28:51.395
I got it, I got it!
Ahhh!

28:52.464 --> 28:53.464
Oh.

29:01.039 --> 29:02.206
Brynn, come on!

29:02.208 --> 29:03.340
Get out of here.

29:03.342 --> 29:04.875
Let's move it.

29:04.877 --> 29:06.043
Get out of here!

29:32.270 --> 29:34.204
There's no point.
We can't stop it.

29:34.206 --> 29:36.140
It just keeps coming.

29:37.442 --> 29:40.210
- Dave!
- Hey! Follow me.

29:43.047 --> 29:44.348
Shit!

29:44.350 --> 29:45.983
Which way?

29:45.985 --> 29:47.465
I don't know,
I'm just as lost as you.

29:50.088 --> 29:51.321
Wait.

29:53.224 --> 29:54.224
Go, go!

30:54.452 --> 30:55.519
What are you guys doing in here?

30:55.521 --> 30:57.254
What have you done?

30:58.289 --> 30:59.456
I'm sorry, ok?

30:59.458 --> 31:00.458
Things,

31:01.459 --> 31:02.860
got out of hand.

31:03.995 --> 31:05.963
None of this
should have happened.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.001
What did you think
was gonna happen?

31:11.003 --> 31:13.103
It was just cardboard.

31:14.439 --> 31:16.206
No one was supposed to get hurt!

31:16.208 --> 31:18.475
Are you getting
the ineptitude and boyish charm?

31:18.477 --> 31:21.311
Well, it's not just
cardboard anymore!

31:21.313 --> 31:24.181
I said don't come in.

31:24.183 --> 31:26.016
I said it's too dangerous.

31:26.018 --> 31:28.418
This is a rescue, you dick!

31:30.121 --> 31:32.055
We're gonna die.

31:32.057 --> 31:33.390
And it's all your fault.

31:45.503 --> 31:46.970
This will work.

31:50.942 --> 31:52.910
All right, through here.

31:57.081 --> 31:59.316
You have to trust me.

31:59.318 --> 32:01.051
I can't lose you guys.

32:04.455 --> 32:05.455
Come on, guys!

32:06.658 --> 32:07.958
Whoa!

32:13.165 --> 32:14.298
Stop it...

32:18.536 --> 32:19.569
Whoa!

32:19.571 --> 32:21.638
What was that?

32:23.042 --> 32:25.442
Dave, we... oh, wow.

32:27.278 --> 32:28.278
Hmm.

32:29.314 --> 32:30.647
Ok.

32:30.649 --> 32:32.516
I suppose this was
only a matter of time.

32:32.518 --> 32:34.051
Are we safe down here?

32:34.053 --> 32:36.186
Safe?
We're not even people.

32:38.523 --> 32:40.991
Dave, are we safe?

32:45.229 --> 32:47.097
We should probably
keep moving.

32:50.401 --> 32:51.635
Is this permanent?

32:51.637 --> 32:53.303
Nothing in here is.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.205
Apparently.

32:55.207 --> 32:58.275
But it's all going to be ok
once we get back
to the apartment.

32:58.277 --> 32:59.242
I promise.

32:59.244 --> 33:00.644
Can you get us there?

33:00.646 --> 33:02.512
Dave, can you get us home?

33:10.221 --> 33:11.254
Run!

33:14.192 --> 33:16.059
It's all gonna be ok once
we get back to the apartment,

33:16.061 --> 33:17.394
it's all gonna be ok once
we get back to the apartment,

33:17.396 --> 33:19.062
ah, look out!

33:19.064 --> 33:21.465
It'll all be ok once
we get back to the apartment,

33:21.467 --> 33:23.467
careful!

33:23.469 --> 33:25.202
Why do you always
have to make it so hard?

33:25.204 --> 33:27.537
Because they say,
if it were easy,
everyone would do it.

33:27.539 --> 33:30.741
That does not apply
to this situation in
any way whatsoever!

33:31.776 --> 33:33.343
Wait.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.545
What's that sound?

33:35.547 --> 33:37.614
Oh, boy.

33:37.616 --> 33:38.648
Duck!

33:44.390 --> 33:45.655
Is everybody ok?

34:00.438 --> 34:02.472
Oh.
Well, that's not so bad.

34:10.380 --> 34:12.581
This way!
Everybody, down here!

34:21.659 --> 34:22.659
Go, go, go,

34:29.434 --> 34:31.201
- here.
- What's this?

34:31.203 --> 34:32.668
Old fort trick, temporary wall.

34:32.670 --> 34:34.737
- What?
- Just tape it.

34:34.739 --> 34:35.739
Shh!

35:13.277 --> 35:15.278
What the fuck did you do?

35:19.550 --> 35:20.684
It's a passion project.

35:20.686 --> 35:22.619
Dave, Greg and Brynn are dead!

35:22.621 --> 35:25.322
- Damn it.
- And Jane with the head.

35:25.324 --> 35:27.324
Damn it!
Why didn't you guys
listen to me?

35:27.326 --> 35:30.127
I didn't want
anyone to get hurt.

35:30.129 --> 35:32.229
It's me.

35:32.231 --> 35:33.631
Well, I'm not trying
to kill anyone.

35:35.299 --> 35:37.467
Ok, I can explain it.
I can explain everything.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.708
No, I can't.
Who else came in?

35:44.710 --> 35:46.209
- Everybody.
- Whooo-Kay. Um...

35:49.480 --> 35:51.148
Well, then we should
probably get out of here.

35:51.150 --> 35:52.582
Um, thank you guys
for coming to get me.

35:52.584 --> 35:53.750
Shall we?

35:53.752 --> 35:55.185
Even if we get out
of the maze,

35:55.187 --> 35:57.754
- we still have a water buffalo...
- Minotaur.

35:57.756 --> 36:00.290
Minotaur in our apartment!

36:00.292 --> 36:02.559
Annie makes a great point.

36:02.561 --> 36:04.881
It's a temporary fix.
It's not going to
keep it out forever.

36:06.631 --> 36:09.666
It's time to make some
motherfucking bull burgers.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.668
- Kill it.
- Great.

36:11.670 --> 36:12.736
Good idea.

36:12.738 --> 36:14.604
Um, but about the maze itself?

36:14.606 --> 36:18.341
Well, I guess it's time
to take out the recycling.

36:18.343 --> 36:21.311
Another great option
from Gordon. Thank you.

36:21.313 --> 36:22.313
Or,

36:24.348 --> 36:25.482
how about we finish it?

36:26.517 --> 36:27.918
Right, guys?

36:27.920 --> 36:29.819
'Cause I've got
all these supplies.

36:29.821 --> 36:32.856
We've got tape,
I've got so much cardboard...

36:32.858 --> 36:34.724
Dave, we are not
building more.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.259
Yeah, this sounds like work.

36:36.261 --> 36:39.262
It is work,
but think about the reward!

36:39.264 --> 36:41.398
- Dave!
- No, you don't understand.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.832
Instead of trying
to defeat the maze,

36:42.834 --> 36:44.501
we've gotta complete the maze!

36:44.503 --> 36:46.736
We're not just doing that
because it rhymes.

36:46.738 --> 36:49.973
Well, then, how about instead
of trying to diminish it,

36:51.676 --> 36:52.943
you guys help me finish it?

36:52.945 --> 36:55.579
How about instead of rhyming,

36:57.815 --> 37:00.617
- fine wining?
- Guys, focus!

37:00.619 --> 37:01.619
What about the minotaur?

37:04.589 --> 37:06.723
Um, we'll just have
to defeat him,

37:06.725 --> 37:08.225
and even the score. Oh!

37:08.227 --> 37:09.359
- Yes!
- Yes!

37:09.361 --> 37:10.694
- He's back.
- Felt nice.

37:10.696 --> 37:14.598
- Come on, guys!
- Listen, I am so close.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.500
Close to what?
How could you even think
about building more?

37:17.502 --> 37:19.803
I know
it's dangerous and unstable,

37:19.805 --> 37:21.805
but that's because
it's incomplete.

37:21.807 --> 37:24.975
And I... if you just
let me finish it...

37:24.977 --> 37:26.509
You just want to
keep working on it

37:26.511 --> 37:28.378
so that we don't have
to destroy it.

37:29.614 --> 37:31.648
Dave, we have to
get out of here.

37:35.653 --> 37:36.953
- Follow me.
- Beautiful.

37:36.955 --> 37:39.389
Can I get one more
for safety? Dave?

37:39.391 --> 37:41.391
For safety. Dave?

38:12.790 --> 38:14.024
What is it?

38:14.026 --> 38:15.458
This is, um...

38:16.927 --> 38:19.396
What's wrong?

38:19.398 --> 38:20.697
I'm not sure.

38:22.867 --> 38:24.901
I don't remember this wall.

38:24.903 --> 38:28.004
Well, that's ok.
You can't remember every wall.

38:28.006 --> 38:29.406
I guess, but,

38:30.975 --> 38:33.710
parts of this are taking
on a life of its own.

38:35.813 --> 38:37.047
It's running unchecked.

38:38.516 --> 38:39.749
What's driving it?

38:39.751 --> 38:40.950
I don't know,

38:45.523 --> 38:46.756
my imagination?

38:46.758 --> 38:47.991
Oh, please.

38:49.060 --> 38:50.894
No, I can't use this.

38:50.896 --> 38:52.395
This whole place is dangerous,

38:52.397 --> 38:54.531
but it's also
very, very fragile.

38:56.701 --> 38:58.068
It's like a spider web.

38:58.070 --> 38:59.369
Any vibration

39:02.574 --> 39:03.606
and it's there.

39:05.476 --> 39:06.810
It's guarding its home.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.612
What is it doing here?

39:09.614 --> 39:10.847
I don't know.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.882
None of this should work,
but look at it.

39:12.884 --> 39:15.418
It's here.

39:15.420 --> 39:17.554
Yeah, in our apartment.

39:20.524 --> 39:21.524
I'm sorry.

39:45.717 --> 39:48.418
I think we're gonna be
safe in here.

39:49.453 --> 39:50.453
Wow.

39:54.992 --> 39:56.059
It's pretty.

39:58.429 --> 40:00.029
Yeah, I was hoping
you'd like it.

40:15.846 --> 40:17.580
Is that the...

40:17.582 --> 40:19.482
Oh, god.

40:19.484 --> 40:20.950
Our British high society drama.

40:28.859 --> 40:31.194
I just couldn't get the story
to come off the page.

40:47.845 --> 40:48.845
Holy shit!

40:58.122 --> 40:59.122
Hey.

41:00.724 --> 41:03.126
- You fuck my wife?
- Did you fuck my wife?

41:03.128 --> 41:04.928
There's no did.
It's just you fuck my wife?

41:04.930 --> 41:06.196
No seriously,
did you fuck my wife?

41:06.198 --> 41:07.230
No did.

41:08.834 --> 41:09.933
What is that?

41:09.935 --> 41:12.569
I... this wasn't my idea.

41:12.571 --> 41:13.571
Oh...

41:15.206 --> 41:17.774
This isn't exactly
the maze that I built.

41:17.776 --> 41:20.043
Some things are just there.

41:24.849 --> 41:25.849
Can we go?

41:30.855 --> 41:33.189
Oh, my god,
you've got to be kidding me.

41:45.135 --> 41:46.135
It's a trap.

41:57.948 --> 41:59.148
It's a trap.

42:10.995 --> 42:12.962
No.

42:12.964 --> 42:14.564
It's a trap.

42:29.179 --> 42:32.782
I'm gonna go, uh, check
the light levels in here.

42:32.784 --> 42:33.883
Yeah, me too.

42:33.885 --> 42:35.218
No, I'm serious, guys.

42:35.220 --> 42:37.287
Don't mess with it.

42:37.289 --> 42:38.955
Oh, my god.

42:38.957 --> 42:39.957
Dave!

42:41.225 --> 42:43.726
I had to learn the hard way.

42:43.728 --> 42:46.095
Is there anything in this maze
that you haven't tried
to stick your hand in?

42:46.097 --> 42:48.698
I didn't try, I did,
thank you very much.

42:48.700 --> 42:50.133
You're welcome,
and don't think I didn't notice

42:50.135 --> 42:52.769
your complete and utter lack
of beard, you paper dick.

42:52.771 --> 42:54.037
I had an interview.

42:54.039 --> 42:56.306
Oh, sellout.

42:56.308 --> 42:57.308
I made this for you!

42:58.876 --> 43:00.610
Thank you.
I don't know why you did.

43:00.612 --> 43:01.678
I get plenty of girls.

43:01.680 --> 43:03.713
All the time.

43:03.715 --> 43:05.648
- How much further? Dave?
- Constantly.

43:06.851 --> 43:09.218
- Dave!
- Huh, yeah, what? Sorry.

43:09.220 --> 43:11.120
Can we keep going?

43:11.122 --> 43:13.056
Yeah!

43:13.058 --> 43:14.058
Yes.

43:36.046 --> 43:37.046
We made it.

43:38.148 --> 43:39.916
We're home!

43:39.918 --> 43:41.017
Yeah.

43:46.957 --> 43:47.957
It's growing.

43:49.693 --> 43:51.933
I know, but if we can finish it,
everything will be fine.

43:54.732 --> 43:57.767
Hey guys, I know we're tired.
I'm exhausted!

43:57.769 --> 43:59.335
But we've got this
giant, glowing,

44:00.938 --> 44:03.239
lady-part in there,

44:03.241 --> 44:05.775
and if we can just lead
the minotaur into here,

44:05.777 --> 44:08.711
and then trick him into there,
he'll turn into cardboard.

44:08.713 --> 44:10.780
Right?

44:10.782 --> 44:13.983
And then we can stop him
easily, no problem!

44:13.985 --> 44:16.719
And then I could probably
disarm all of the traps,

44:16.721 --> 44:19.756
and then we can
finish this maze!

44:19.758 --> 44:20.957
Who is with me?

44:28.298 --> 44:29.799
Can we get
that interview now?

44:29.801 --> 44:32.435
No.

44:32.437 --> 44:34.437
There's no interviews.

44:34.439 --> 44:36.973
So, Dave,
you know what I'm gonna ask.

44:36.975 --> 44:38.941
And remember,
they won't hear me,

44:38.943 --> 44:42.278
so if you could
answer the questions
in complete sentences.

44:42.280 --> 44:44.781
"I built the maze because," and.

44:47.117 --> 44:51.254
I built the maze because
I wanted to make something.

44:52.956 --> 44:54.824
And?

44:54.826 --> 44:57.226
And I wanted to make something
that people would see and say,

45:00.964 --> 45:03.199
"that's cool,
why didn't I think of that?"

45:03.201 --> 45:05.268
Right, I get it.
You had to make it.

45:05.270 --> 45:06.969
Yeah.

45:06.971 --> 45:09.005
People spend their whole lives
striving to find something,

45:09.007 --> 45:10.973
- and you did.
- Yeah.

45:10.975 --> 45:12.909
- So tell me about that.
- Ok.

45:12.911 --> 45:16.713
Some people spend
their whole lives
trying, or striving,

45:18.082 --> 45:21.184
to make something, and I did.

45:23.287 --> 45:24.487
But, that's not right.

45:26.123 --> 45:27.123
Tell me about that.

45:31.896 --> 45:34.797
I didn't, I wasn't striving
for anything.

45:34.799 --> 45:37.867
I just wanted to make something.

45:37.869 --> 45:41.237
And I can't sit on my couch
and watch TV,

45:41.239 --> 45:43.005
or think that the Internet
is going to inspire me,

45:43.007 --> 45:45.975
because I'm fucking
30 years old.

45:45.977 --> 45:48.811
And my parents are
still giving me money.

45:48.813 --> 45:51.347
And I bore the shit out of them.

45:51.349 --> 45:55.384
And I work jobs that I hate
that I have to beg to get.

45:59.123 --> 46:01.257
Do you know what it means
to be broke?

46:01.259 --> 46:04.327
It means that you are broken.

46:04.329 --> 46:06.162
That you don't work.

46:08.365 --> 46:09.465
Ahhh!

46:09.467 --> 46:11.234
Everyone are assholes!

46:11.236 --> 46:13.102
- Is.
- Everyone is assholes!

46:13.104 --> 46:14.537
No, that doesn't sound right.

46:14.539 --> 46:18.307
And I'm not angry,
I'm fucking furious!

46:18.309 --> 46:21.010
But don't make me seem angry.

46:21.012 --> 46:22.311
Or spineless, please.

46:22.313 --> 46:24.447
- No, no, of course not.
- For fuck's sake,

46:24.449 --> 46:27.316
do not make me look like
a spineless asshole.

46:27.318 --> 46:29.185
Of course not. Boom.

46:32.556 --> 46:35.892
I built something because
I wanted to build something.

46:35.894 --> 46:38.427
And if I could just finish it,

46:38.429 --> 46:39.929
I just know that it would...

46:41.498 --> 46:42.865
It would be great!

46:42.867 --> 46:46.335
And tertiary, tertiary,

46:46.337 --> 46:50.173
I might be responsible for
the people that died yesterday.

46:50.175 --> 46:53.209
Or today, I don't know
what time it is.

46:56.513 --> 46:57.513
And if I am,

47:01.985 --> 47:03.186
then I'm sorry.

47:05.989 --> 47:07.990
Tertiarily.

47:07.992 --> 47:08.992
Tell me more about that.

47:11.295 --> 47:13.863
Dave, don't go.

47:13.865 --> 47:15.398
A few more questions.

47:29.112 --> 47:31.047
Ugh!

47:31.049 --> 47:32.348
Such an asshole!

48:02.512 --> 48:04.480
Dave, we have
to get out of here.

48:09.253 --> 48:10.253
Ok.

48:12.890 --> 48:14.423
Here!

48:14.425 --> 48:17.526
Guys, we're gonna
get out of the maze.

48:17.528 --> 48:19.262
Let's get some ideas.

48:19.264 --> 48:21.330
Here's everything
we've got to work with.

48:21.332 --> 48:23.599
Ok, this could work.

48:23.601 --> 48:27.370
We set this against
John Cougar Mellencamp's
walls come tumbling down.

48:27.372 --> 48:28.638
Somehow this thing is alive.

48:28.640 --> 48:30.006
It's growing.

48:30.008 --> 48:32.341
And it's organic.

48:32.343 --> 48:34.677
Maybe if the five of us
could find the heart,

48:34.679 --> 48:37.346
- we could kill it.
- Five, you mean six.

48:42.219 --> 48:43.452
What the hell happened to you?

48:45.455 --> 48:50.259
Heh, I just thought
I could slide right back in.

48:50.261 --> 48:52.295
Got lost for a second there.

48:52.297 --> 48:53.596
Are you ok?

48:53.598 --> 48:55.298
Yeah.

48:55.300 --> 48:58.000
You sure?
What happened to you?

48:58.002 --> 49:00.303
I don't want to talk about it.

49:00.305 --> 49:02.405
Wait, how did you find us?

49:12.115 --> 49:13.683
Hey, come on!
We're guests here.

49:13.685 --> 49:15.418
Goddamn it.

49:17.688 --> 49:19.422
We got him. We got him.

49:19.424 --> 49:21.357
Let's capture some of
the fear and the dread.

50:01.331 --> 50:02.331
Unh!

50:17.314 --> 50:19.115
Help... me.

50:19.117 --> 50:21.283
Help.

50:21.285 --> 50:22.285
Please.

51:03.727 --> 51:04.760
Ok, where were we?

51:05.796 --> 51:07.696
Something about a heart?

51:07.698 --> 51:08.798
Right? Gordon.

51:10.767 --> 51:14.303
Gordon, Gordon, I need you.

51:14.305 --> 51:16.672
Ok, a heart?
Where's the heart?
Is there a heart?

51:16.674 --> 51:18.240
Can we stop it?

51:18.242 --> 51:19.341
Well,

51:20.444 --> 51:23.512
you know,
traditionally,

51:23.514 --> 51:25.614
if there's
a structural weakness,

51:25.616 --> 51:27.450
it would be in the center.

51:27.452 --> 51:28.751
Dave, you said you that
you started from the center

51:28.753 --> 51:30.719
and then you built
outward, right?

51:30.721 --> 51:33.155
Yeah.
Yeah, like a seashell.

51:33.157 --> 51:34.423
Ok, so is there a heart?

51:34.425 --> 51:35.691
A generator?

51:35.693 --> 51:37.426
A light switch?

51:37.428 --> 51:38.861
- Primordial Clay?
- Oh, you mean like a chrysalis?

51:38.863 --> 51:40.496
- Yes!
- No.

51:40.498 --> 51:43.265
See, that's a drag,
because if there was,

51:43.267 --> 51:45.734
we could just find
the center, destroy it,

51:45.736 --> 51:48.370
and, you know, go home.

51:48.372 --> 51:50.639
Well, there is no
weak spot to exploit,

51:53.477 --> 51:55.377
because I didn't make one.

51:55.379 --> 51:56.412
Why didn't you make one?

51:58.215 --> 52:02.518
Because if I made one, then
someone could destroy it.

52:02.520 --> 52:05.454
You don't have to fail if
you never finish anything.

52:05.456 --> 52:08.157
But Dave, we all
have to deal with that.

52:08.159 --> 52:10.493
Every day.

52:10.495 --> 52:13.662
And you have to get over it
if you're ever gonna
accomplish anything.

52:13.664 --> 52:15.197
You know, like,
saving our lives.

52:17.400 --> 52:18.734
It's just that
this is the only thing

52:18.736 --> 52:22.404
that I ever started
that's worth finishing,

52:25.509 --> 52:27.409
and if I hadn't made it

52:30.313 --> 52:32.214
then no one
would have gotten hurt.

52:36.920 --> 52:39.588
But you did make it.

52:39.590 --> 52:42.491
It's here, and we're here in it,

52:44.394 --> 52:47.396
and now we need you
to get us out of here.

52:47.398 --> 52:49.932
Wait, are you saying
I should finish it?

52:54.304 --> 52:57.206
You've got to
build the chrysalis,

52:57.208 --> 53:00.709
in order to rescue us.

53:01.779 --> 53:03.212
Oh, my god, I love you.

53:03.214 --> 53:04.780
Let me get this straight.

53:04.782 --> 53:06.916
We're gonna build a chrysalis
and then destroy it.

53:06.918 --> 53:08.684
- Would that be right?
- Let's go!

53:08.686 --> 53:09.952
To the chrysalis chamber!

53:09.954 --> 53:11.654
I'll take that as a yes.

53:11.656 --> 53:13.689
Oh, no, no,
actually don't go that way.

53:13.691 --> 53:16.425
Oh, god.
What... what did I step in?
I'm dead, aren't I?

53:16.427 --> 53:18.827
I'm dead. Great.
Why... Dave!

53:18.829 --> 53:21.197
- Why are you doing this to me?
- You're fine.

53:22.966 --> 53:24.633
Oh, for god's sake.

53:25.969 --> 53:29.371
Did you build a maze
inside your maze?

53:29.373 --> 53:30.906
I'm in
a completely new place, guys!

53:30.908 --> 53:32.641
I swear to god.

53:32.643 --> 53:34.677
I'm a new guy.

53:34.679 --> 53:36.312
I mean
you couldn't even finish
the little maze

53:36.314 --> 53:37.780
inside of the big maze,
could you?

53:37.782 --> 53:39.515
Before, I was bored!

53:39.517 --> 53:40.616
And flailing.

53:40.618 --> 53:42.651
And now, I'm completely focused!

53:42.653 --> 53:44.386
Honey, can you please
back me up?

53:44.388 --> 53:47.323
Did you ever stop building?

53:47.325 --> 53:49.992
Yes, I did.
When pizza was being discussed.

53:49.994 --> 53:52.394
The initial pizza concept,
or delivery?

53:52.396 --> 53:54.763
I wasn't done!

53:54.765 --> 53:56.298
Ah! And what a surprise,
you're not finished here!

53:56.300 --> 53:57.833
Who saw that coming?

53:57.835 --> 54:01.537
Well, guys, another part of
the maze successfully navigated.

54:01.539 --> 54:03.272
I'm so glad we had
the time to enjoy this.

54:03.274 --> 54:04.673
Oh, my god, come on.

54:04.675 --> 54:05.774
Hey, thank you.

54:37.642 --> 54:39.975
- Oh, hey, guys!
- Hey.

54:41.544 --> 54:43.512
- Brynn?
- Hey!

54:43.514 --> 54:45.047
High five!

54:45.049 --> 54:47.283
Don't, don't, don't!

54:47.285 --> 54:49.285
Dave, did you build
a cardboard Brynn?

54:49.287 --> 54:50.819
Hey, high five!

54:50.821 --> 54:53.689
- Hey, Brynn.
- Thought you were dead.

54:53.691 --> 54:55.624
No way!
I'm fine!

54:57.060 --> 54:59.628
Where are we headed?
What are we up to?

54:59.630 --> 55:01.330
Come over here and talk to me.

55:01.332 --> 55:02.332
High five!

55:04.534 --> 55:06.035
Nowhere. We're just,

55:08.004 --> 55:09.872
just enjoying the maze.

55:09.874 --> 55:12.541
Oh, yeah, you're telling me!

55:12.543 --> 55:13.942
Come over here and talk to me.

55:13.944 --> 55:15.077
We're cool.

55:16.880 --> 55:18.781
Yeah, we are!
High five!

55:18.783 --> 55:19.915
We have to get past this thing.

55:19.917 --> 55:21.650
Maybe we can distract it?

55:21.652 --> 55:23.519
High five?

55:23.521 --> 55:24.687
High five.

55:27.058 --> 55:28.090
We gotta go now.

55:28.092 --> 55:29.858
- But...
- No.

55:29.860 --> 55:33.562
The longer we take,
the bigger
this thing's gonna get.

55:33.564 --> 55:36.465
We have to get some distance,
find a straightaway,

55:36.467 --> 55:38.367
and then cut to the center.

55:38.369 --> 55:39.868
But what about the spider web?

55:42.038 --> 55:43.539
We move fast.

55:44.641 --> 55:45.708
Distract her.

55:46.910 --> 55:49.011
And don't let it
leave this room.

55:59.990 --> 56:00.990
Ok, thank you.

56:04.694 --> 56:06.395
Ok, can I get a white balance?

56:11.735 --> 56:13.102
Thank you, Gordon.

56:23.546 --> 56:26.048
Ok, it looks fine.
So, Brynn.

56:26.050 --> 56:28.951
- High five!
- High five.

56:28.953 --> 56:32.454
- Uh, Brynn, what drives you?
- High fives!

56:33.656 --> 56:35.624
Come over here
and give me a high five!

56:35.626 --> 56:36.925
Oh, I will.

56:36.927 --> 56:39.161
But let's just stay on this
for a moment.

56:39.163 --> 56:41.663
What drives you?
What makes you tick?

56:41.665 --> 56:42.898
Let's talk about that.

56:54.077 --> 56:55.110
High five!

56:55.112 --> 56:56.578
Ask why it wants a high five.

56:59.883 --> 57:03.018
Why, in your own words,
do you want a high five?

57:03.020 --> 57:05.053
- Because high fives...
- Ahem.

57:06.856 --> 57:09.992
I want a high five because
high fives is what man does.

57:11.127 --> 57:12.127
And why is that?

57:13.164 --> 57:14.563
Come on, keep it talking.

57:14.565 --> 57:17.132
Gordon, please
let me do my job.

57:17.134 --> 57:18.767
Why are we here, Brynn?

57:18.769 --> 57:21.570
Life is a series
of incomplete moments

57:21.572 --> 57:24.039
from which there is no escape.

57:25.608 --> 57:26.842
Well, that's different.

57:32.816 --> 57:34.082
Ok, should we build
the chrysalis now,

57:34.084 --> 57:36.518
- or should we...
- Just a little farther.

57:40.623 --> 57:42.191
How about here?

57:42.193 --> 57:43.892
Should we cut to
the center here?

57:43.894 --> 57:45.761
Just a little farther.

57:47.063 --> 57:48.464
Dave.

57:49.532 --> 57:50.532
Dave?

57:52.135 --> 57:53.135
Dave?

57:59.642 --> 58:01.977
You didn't have to
get up so early.

58:04.214 --> 58:06.014
I wanted to be with you.

58:07.717 --> 58:09.618
Your coffee's gonna get cold.

58:10.820 --> 58:12.120
Where's your cup?

58:12.122 --> 58:14.256
I don't want coffee
this morning.

58:18.761 --> 58:20.262
Are you going back to sleep?

58:20.264 --> 58:21.264
No.

58:22.799 --> 58:25.000
There just wasn't
enough for two.

58:25.002 --> 58:27.102
Well, now I feel bad.

58:27.104 --> 58:29.705
Don't feel bad.
Just have your coffee.

58:29.707 --> 58:31.807
Here,

58:31.809 --> 58:32.875
have some.

58:33.943 --> 58:35.911
I made it for you.

58:35.913 --> 58:38.847
I don't want to drink it all
if you can't have any.

58:38.849 --> 58:40.048
Just drink it.

58:50.660 --> 58:52.728
What have you got
going on today?

58:52.730 --> 58:54.763
The usual.

58:54.765 --> 58:56.532
Well, look out, world.

59:02.305 --> 59:04.273
I thought you weren't
going to have any.

59:06.075 --> 59:07.075
I changed my mind.

59:24.127 --> 59:26.028
Where's your glass?

59:26.030 --> 59:28.564
I'm not drinking
anything tonight.

59:28.566 --> 59:29.932
Big day tomorrow?

59:29.934 --> 59:30.934
Yep.

59:32.068 --> 59:33.268
Well, now I feel bad.

59:40.910 --> 59:43.579
Don't feel bad,
just have a drink.

59:51.721 --> 59:55.123
- Here, you have some.
- Just drink it.

01:00:00.997 --> 01:00:02.397
What have you got
going on tomorrow?

01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:05.133
The usual.

01:00:05.135 --> 01:00:06.735
Look out, world.

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:24.953
Oh, I thought
you weren't going to have any.

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:26.655
I changed my mind.

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:37.099
There's nothing left.

01:00:37.101 --> 01:00:38.634
Don't feel bad.

01:00:38.636 --> 01:00:40.669
Well, I wanted us to have some.

01:00:40.671 --> 01:00:42.704
We'll be all right.

01:00:42.706 --> 01:00:44.339
Are you gonna
go back to sleep?

01:00:44.341 --> 01:00:45.341
No.

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:48.744
I wanna be with you.

01:00:48.746 --> 01:00:50.112
What are we gonna do tomorrow?

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:53.048
The usual.

01:01:07.163 --> 01:01:08.730
What are you doing?

01:01:10.299 --> 01:01:11.833
I'm changing my mind.

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:36.992
You are free to roam,
but not to leave.

01:01:36.994 --> 01:01:38.226
We are growing.

01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:41.096
So

01:01:41.098 --> 01:01:44.366
Are you and the maze
connected?

01:01:44.368 --> 01:01:46.468
Huh! No way!

01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:48.403
I'm Brynn!
High five!

01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:06.221
I think it's time for plan B.

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:11.126
Uh, Brynn, over here.
Over here.

01:02:11.128 --> 01:02:13.729
- Just, high five!
- High five!

01:02:13.731 --> 01:02:15.097
Real soon!

01:02:15.099 --> 01:02:16.798
Let's talk about the minotaur.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:19.167
Now he's an interesting guy,
really fascinating.

01:02:19.169 --> 01:02:21.737
Born in shame,

01:02:21.739 --> 01:02:24.139
the dark manifestation,

01:02:24.141 --> 01:02:25.841
the unwanted.

01:02:25.843 --> 01:02:29.478
Where else to be cast away
but to the inescapable?

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:30.979
That's great.

01:02:30.981 --> 01:02:32.247
Very poetic.

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:35.817
Uh, can you just
say something like,

01:02:35.819 --> 01:02:37.886
"I'll tell you where
you put the unwanted,"

01:02:37.888 --> 01:02:39.128
"in a labyrinth, that's where."

01:02:41.023 --> 01:02:42.090
Something like that,
in your own words.

01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:43.092
Just go on.

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:54.369
Go on.

01:02:54.371 --> 01:03:00.108
Imprisoned in the labyrinth,
its protector and prisoner.

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:02.110
- Protectisoner.
- Shh.

01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:03.145
What does it want?

01:03:13.856 --> 01:03:18.059
The minotaur is a predator,
haunted by bloodlust.

01:03:18.061 --> 01:03:24.199
The only thing it desires more
than human flesh is freedom.

01:03:24.201 --> 01:03:25.500
Do you desire freedom?

01:03:27.003 --> 01:03:28.170
Do you feel trapped?

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:31.573
Brynn?

01:03:31.575 --> 01:03:35.544
I'm getting tired
of your questions, human.

01:03:35.546 --> 01:03:38.246
Well, we're really getting
to something deep here.

01:03:38.248 --> 01:03:39.581
You think so?

01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:41.249
Oh, Brynn,
you're killing it.

01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:42.484
You think so?

01:03:49.425 --> 01:03:50.492
This is it.

01:03:52.895 --> 01:03:55.530
- The chrysalis.
- The power source.

01:04:00.203 --> 01:04:01.837
What's that?

01:04:01.839 --> 01:04:04.272
This is, uh, a stand.

01:04:04.274 --> 01:04:05.974
Oh.

01:04:05.976 --> 01:04:06.976
Oh!

01:04:11.981 --> 01:04:14.583
Now we bring it
to the center, baby.

01:04:14.585 --> 01:04:15.984
Yeah, we do.

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:28.930
Impulse buy?

01:04:29.966 --> 01:04:32.100
It was at the register.

01:04:32.102 --> 01:04:35.170
Once you start, don't stop
until you get to the center.

01:04:35.172 --> 01:04:39.307
The second you make
your first cut,
it's coming after us.

01:04:42.979 --> 01:04:43.979
I love you.

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:50.745
Uh, what if Brynn's
still in there?

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:52.654
Fighting to get out?

01:04:59.395 --> 01:05:00.395
Now!

01:05:48.344 --> 01:05:51.079
- We need that box in the middle.
- You got it, babe.

01:06:14.136 --> 01:06:15.136
The tapes!

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.506
You fuck my wife?

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:27.649
Come on.

01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:28.651
Come on!

01:06:32.755 --> 01:06:35.223
- Now what?
- I need it to spin.

01:06:35.225 --> 01:06:37.325
It's gotta be spinning.

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:38.426
Ok.

01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:46.034
Whoa!

01:06:56.579 --> 01:06:58.313
Get to that center!

01:06:58.315 --> 01:07:01.049
- Do the thing!
- Is that the chrysalis?

01:07:01.051 --> 01:07:02.517
What'd I say, what'd I say?

01:07:07.523 --> 01:07:08.523
Look, what is that?

01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:09.724
Is that the exit?

01:07:09.726 --> 01:07:12.127
Right there?
This way to freedom?

01:07:12.129 --> 01:07:14.763
Well, that is wildly convenient.
That's crazy.

01:07:14.765 --> 01:07:16.064
Ah!

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:27.375
Can you guys cheat out
for me a little bit?

01:07:27.377 --> 01:07:28.377
Don't look at me.

01:07:35.317 --> 01:07:36.618
Boy, I sure hope
there's some pizza left

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:39.454
in that apartment that
is right in front of me.

01:07:58.407 --> 01:07:59.541
Oh, my god.
It's beautiful.

01:08:02.211 --> 01:08:05.011
What am I going to do
with all this free time
once I'm out in the world?

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:32.874
I got one!

01:08:32.876 --> 01:08:35.443
When I first heard about
Dave being trapped in a maze,

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:36.444
I was like...

01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:42.990
Uh!

01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:41.609
Label your tapes
and email me your time code.

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:47.815
Good work.

01:14:48.884 --> 01:14:49.917
The camera loves you.

01:14:52.654 --> 01:14:54.021
We need a title.

01:14:54.023 --> 01:14:57.158
How about, I don't know,
"Dave made a maze"?

01:14:58.627 --> 01:15:00.761
It's a little on the nose.

01:15:00.763 --> 01:15:03.531
It's actually not a maze.
It's a labyrinth.

01:15:03.533 --> 01:15:05.099
We'll think of something.

01:15:06.702 --> 01:15:08.870
Gordon, I need you to notify

01:15:08.872 --> 01:15:11.772
the families of everyone
who died here today.

01:15:11.774 --> 01:15:12.774
Totally.

01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:15.209
Wait, what?
