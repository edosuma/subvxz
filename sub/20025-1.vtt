WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:07.273 --> 00:11.811
Six years ago, the Geordie squad
first got together.

00:15.315 --> 00:17.217
But it's not all been one big party.

00:17.283 --> 00:18.284
Back to work.

00:19.285 --> 00:21.955
We had to work for
that wrinkly fuck, Anna.

00:23.556 --> 00:26.292
We fucking nailed it.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.828
# Any cock's good
But it's cock, cock, cock #

00:30.797 --> 00:33.767
We've only gone and made
her business a global success.

00:34.968 --> 00:38.004
So, now, the squad is expanding.

00:38.071 --> 00:40.640
Oi, oi!
Hello!

00:40.707 --> 00:43.643
Hiya!
(cheering)

00:49.215 --> 00:52.819
I'm not gonna be able to
keep yous all on full time.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.455
We need to help Anna decide
who stays...

00:56.923 --> 00:59.726
...and who goes.
(cheering)

00:59.793 --> 01:02.829
The only thing
we give a shit about is...

01:02.896 --> 01:04.864
...are they fucking radge enough...

01:04.931 --> 01:07.634
...to join this crazy family?

01:13.373 --> 01:15.308
Let wuh fucking gan.

01:17.110 --> 01:19.045
I should have a degree in pulling.

01:19.112 --> 01:21.414
Never kiss anyone with no six-pack.

01:21.481 --> 01:24.117
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:24.184 --> 01:26.586
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:26.653 --> 01:28.688
I'm preened to perfection.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.090
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

01:31.157 --> 01:33.927
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

01:33.993 --> 01:36.896
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

01:36.963 --> 01:40.600
Me quiff's pure lethal
and me banter's pure naughty.

01:40.667 --> 01:42.669
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:54.647 --> 01:57.617
I've been eating that many
chicken nuggets lately,

01:57.684 --> 02:00.520
I've started to look like one.
So I need to be healthy.

02:00.587 --> 02:03.289
So, me and me mam are off to
the fruit and veg market.

02:03.356 --> 02:05.492
Hiya.
I just want some healthy carrots.

02:08.527 --> 02:13.733
(phone rings) Who the fuck is this
little charver ringing us now?

02:13.800 --> 02:15.902
I'm trying to get me five a day, man.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.937
Hello!
Hi, Chloe. How are you?

02:18.004 --> 02:19.305
(It's Anna.)

02:19.372 --> 02:21.941
Chloe, I want you
back in the house today.

02:22.008 --> 02:23.743
Today?
Are you mad?!

02:23.810 --> 02:25.678
I am busy at the fruit and veg shop.

02:25.745 --> 02:27.981
"I've got loads of work
lined up for you."

02:28.047 --> 02:30.416
"Things are gonna be
different this time."

02:30.483 --> 02:35.021
Can you bell all the others, please?
And I don't want anybody to be late.

02:35.088 --> 02:37.824
What about one minute?
(gasps) Put the phone down.

02:37.891 --> 02:41.294
A lot of work lined up?
Things are gonna be different? Eh?

02:41.361 --> 02:43.563
What the hell is Anna talking about?

02:45.965 --> 02:47.800
Oi, oi, you little radge packets.

02:47.867 --> 02:50.637
"I've just had a call
off fucking Anna banana,

02:50.703 --> 02:52.639
she wants us back at the house ASAP."

02:52.705 --> 02:56.442
"She's got a lot of work lined up
and things are gonna be different."

02:56.509 --> 03:00.213
"So pack your fucking suitcases.
Love you, you bitches! Woo-hoo!"

03:01.614 --> 03:02.615
OK.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.951
Chloe, I'm sitting with me grandad,
man.

03:09.155 --> 03:11.491
Buddy's my new dog
and I love him to bits,

03:11.558 --> 03:13.726
but Anna and the crew
need me for work.

03:13.793 --> 03:16.729
So I'm sorry, Buds,
you're staying here with your nana.

03:24.304 --> 03:26.039
Oh, it's fucking scruffy, that.

03:26.105 --> 03:28.575
Anna wants wuh back in the house
quick time,

03:28.641 --> 03:30.777
but mans hasn't even
done his washing.

03:30.843 --> 03:32.412
Taxi!

03:32.478 --> 03:33.713
To Marnie's house!

03:35.415 --> 03:37.317
Yup.
I feel so nervous,

03:37.383 --> 03:39.886
because last time,
me and Aaron were together.

03:39.953 --> 03:42.055
And now I'm with
me new boyfriend Lewis

03:42.121 --> 03:44.958
and I haven't seen Aaron
since we last split.

03:46.893 --> 03:50.797
On the way, I'm gonna pick the boys
up, so we can arrive together.

03:50.863 --> 03:52.765
Oi, oi. (laughs)

03:52.832 --> 03:55.668
I can't wait to get back in
the house and get hammered.

03:56.603 --> 04:00.006
Look like a proud lesbian today,
don't you? Shut up, man!

04:06.079 --> 04:07.146
(car horn)

04:07.213 --> 04:10.717
We get to Aaron's, he's ready, he
runs straight to the car. Let's go.

04:10.783 --> 04:14.787
Let's get this fucking party
started. Boot's open, man.

04:14.854 --> 04:19.392
What do yous two not understand?
You put your case in, shut the boot.

04:20.226 --> 04:21.394
Fucking hell.

04:22.562 --> 04:27.133
Why is the boot still open? Fuck it,
I'm gonna have to do it myself.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.635
Know what I mean?

04:29.602 --> 04:31.204
Don't know how to shut a boot.

04:32.238 --> 04:34.574
I've got a feeling
we'll have a good time.

04:34.641 --> 04:37.543
I haven't seen Chloe in ages.
I've missed her so much.

04:37.610 --> 04:41.147
Do you still care for Martin?
Any feelings there? Yeah.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.049
I do. Do ya?
Always will.

04:43.116 --> 04:46.119
Last time round,
all me and Marty did was argue.

04:46.185 --> 04:49.722
I want it to change this time,
so I'm gonna be his friend.

04:49.789 --> 04:53.726
Dead cool, dead sexy, and then
he might make us his girlfriend!

04:53.793 --> 04:58.331
I wanna have a good time, go on like
I'm not bothered, even though I am.

04:59.999 --> 05:02.201
Back in Newcastle
and I'm with the boys.

05:02.268 --> 05:05.738
Only person missing is Scott.
Maybe he'll come later on the bus?

05:05.805 --> 05:08.574
Are we a three-man team?
No, you're a two-man team.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.943
Obviously a three-man team,
but, er...

05:11.010 --> 05:12.645
Got a bird?
I've got a bird, man.

05:12.712 --> 05:15.782
Last time, I was gonna see
what happened with Charlotte.

05:15.848 --> 05:19.052
We did meet up, it didn't go
the way I thought it was gonna go.

05:19.118 --> 05:22.889
We've both gone our separate ways,
I've got a girlfriend and I'm happy.

05:24.991 --> 05:28.227
Me and Marnie left last time
as boyfriend and girlfriend.

05:28.294 --> 05:31.330
Within a few weeks,
she had a new boyfriend.

05:31.397 --> 05:34.400
I feel like she
completely mugged us off.

05:37.403 --> 05:39.205
You need to bang a bird.
Aye.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.545
Hi, babies!

05:47.080 --> 05:48.548
Hello?!

05:48.614 --> 05:52.585
Yes! I am the first one.
That means, this time around,

05:52.652 --> 05:53.986
this house is my house.

05:56.122 --> 05:57.123
Right.

05:58.991 --> 06:00.526
(gasps)

06:00.593 --> 06:02.929
Oh. The little fuckers have arrived.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.299
Oh, we have got new decor.

06:06.365 --> 06:07.700
Ooh, yeah...
(yells)

06:07.767 --> 06:10.536
(screams)
You fucking stupid twat.

06:10.603 --> 06:12.939
(laughs)
Nathan, man, you fucking dick.

06:13.005 --> 06:15.174
I nearly shit me
fucking pants there.

06:15.241 --> 06:18.344
I haven't even brought
enough clean kegs as it is.

06:20.313 --> 06:23.249
I'm gonna get a bed, mate.
Oh, bedroom!

06:23.316 --> 06:25.251
It's so good seeing the lads,

06:25.318 --> 06:28.321
cos I can't wait to get
fucking mortal with them already.

06:28.387 --> 06:29.856
(yells)

06:43.369 --> 06:45.171
Oi, oi!
Hi, girls!

06:45.238 --> 06:46.405
Yous all right?
Hi!

06:46.472 --> 06:49.575
I walk in,
everyone's sitting there drinking,

06:49.642 --> 06:52.478
I see Aaron and I just feel
so uncomfortable.

06:52.545 --> 06:54.680
Best thing to do is just ignore him.

06:54.747 --> 06:57.250
Hey, everybody!
Why you wearing a nightie?

06:57.316 --> 07:00.887
Marty's caught me eye. Pretty hard
not to, he's got a massive quiff.

07:00.953 --> 07:03.856
Like his massive chopper.
Have you passed your test?

07:03.923 --> 07:07.160
No, I failed again.
I got a taxi this time with Marnie.

07:07.226 --> 07:10.730
It feels so weird seeing Marnie
for the first time since we split.

07:10.797 --> 07:14.267
She hasn't come over to speak to me,
no way I'm going out of my way

07:14.333 --> 07:16.669
to speak to her.
No Holly, no Chantelle.

07:16.736 --> 07:19.438
No Charlotte. We're gonna be
like the fabulous six.

07:19.505 --> 07:21.374
I'm the most fabulous!
I am.

07:21.440 --> 07:24.076
No, I am.
I'm gay, so I'm obviously fabulous.

07:24.143 --> 07:27.280
Right now, things do feel different.
we're a small squad.

07:27.346 --> 07:29.282
Which means we have to do more work.

07:29.348 --> 07:32.718
Hopefully Anna will turn up soon
and explain what is going on.

07:32.785 --> 07:35.454
(cheering)

07:35.521 --> 07:37.323
Is anyone else getting changed?

07:43.563 --> 07:46.732
Why are you going at that bed?
I'm testing the beds, man.

07:46.799 --> 07:50.937
I've still got my two main bitches.
God, I've missed these.

07:51.003 --> 07:54.841
I've got something to tell you. I
think you'll be really proud of us.

07:54.907 --> 07:57.944
So, I've experienced recently
with the bumhole.

07:58.010 --> 08:00.379
Have you?!
And I had an orgasm.

08:00.446 --> 08:04.250
You go, girl.
Up the bum is twice as fun.

08:04.317 --> 08:07.653
Right, but wait there.
Orgasm from where, the bumhole? Yeah!

08:07.720 --> 08:11.224
Eh?! Better than the fanny one?
I feel like a new woman.

08:11.290 --> 08:14.861
Out of all the girls, it would
only be Sophie who could understand

08:14.927 --> 08:17.096
how fun the bum can be.

08:18.130 --> 08:20.967
No, I washed it.
Me mam said I was raised by wolves.

08:21.033 --> 08:22.268
(laughs)

08:28.040 --> 08:30.610
I just wanna start
getting fucking pissed.

08:30.676 --> 08:33.813
Anna's brought us back in this house
for some sort of work.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.414
But no-one knows
what the fuck is going on.

08:37.515 --> 08:40.086
(knocking)
Who's that?

08:40.152 --> 08:42.655
Hold on a minute,
there's a knock at the door.

08:42.722 --> 08:45.825
That best be Anna to tell us
what the fucking craic is.

08:45.892 --> 08:47.360
Who is it?

08:47.426 --> 08:49.629
Oh, it's a leg.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.163
(yells)
(cheering)

08:51.230 --> 08:54.400
I am fucking back.

08:55.735 --> 08:58.037
Howay, Sophie.
Thank fuck you're here.

08:58.104 --> 08:59.438
What a result.

08:59.505 --> 09:01.941
(shouting, laughter)

09:02.008 --> 09:04.610
I can't believe that
me cousin Sophie's here.

09:04.677 --> 09:06.479
This is the best news ever.

09:06.545 --> 09:09.949
What was it? Fabulous six to the...
sensational seven.

09:10.016 --> 09:12.818
Scott's not here? Is he coming back?
None of us know.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.820
Still a spare bed in the boys' room.

09:14.887 --> 09:17.290
No-one seems to know
what the hell is going on.

09:17.356 --> 09:20.426
But surprise, surprise,
Scott is late for work again.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.194
Get it down you.

09:23.596 --> 09:25.598
(groaning)
There's nae sign of Anna.

09:25.665 --> 09:28.367
Sorry, boss.
We'll see you when we see you.

09:28.434 --> 09:31.103
Fucking no chance
we're staying in tonight.

09:31.170 --> 09:33.906
(cheering)

09:33.973 --> 09:35.608
Get ready!

09:44.984 --> 09:48.321
Girls! Nathan! Gnash on.

09:48.387 --> 09:51.057
I cannot wait to dance my dick off,

09:51.123 --> 09:54.360
so will yous just please,
please, please hurry the fuck up?

09:54.427 --> 09:56.028
Hello, lads!

09:56.095 --> 09:59.098
It's so good to be
back in this house with the squad.

09:59.165 --> 10:01.867
And I'm gonna have
the time of my life.

10:01.934 --> 10:05.037
Let's have a cheers!
(cheering)

10:05.905 --> 10:08.207
It's family night,
which means one thing.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.009
Getting fucking mortal.

10:10.076 --> 10:12.545
(all cheering)

10:16.816 --> 10:19.518
I'm having a mint night.
This is what it's all about.

10:19.585 --> 10:21.387
Food fight!

10:21.454 --> 10:24.523
I wish that wasn't ketchup
you're squirting over my face.

10:24.590 --> 10:27.526
Here she is, looking like
the big fucking banana.

10:27.593 --> 10:30.763
I'm going to need more workers.
What?

10:30.830 --> 10:33.099
(all exclaim)
Oh, my God.

10:33.165 --> 10:35.468
This is exciting.
Hello?

10:35.534 --> 10:36.869
Who is that?
Hello?

10:37.670 --> 10:39.672
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

10:42.041 --> 10:42.241
.

10:44.710 --> 10:44.910
.

10:52.885 --> 10:54.887
It's our first night
back in the Toon,

10:54.954 --> 10:58.357
and we're going to my favourite
fucking place, Illegitimate.

11:02.428 --> 11:04.930
I'm so glad that Anna's
called us back,

11:04.997 --> 11:07.366
cos it's wicked
being out with the family.

11:07.433 --> 11:10.136
Let's get drunk, bitches!
(all cheer)

11:17.710 --> 11:23.115
It is so good to be back with this
crazy, insane fucked-up family.

11:28.120 --> 11:32.158
I haven't spoke to Marnie, and to
be honest, I'm not really bothered.

11:32.224 --> 11:34.326
I'm here to have a wicked night.

11:37.663 --> 11:40.900
I didn't really feel anything
until walking into the house

11:40.966 --> 11:43.269
and seeing Aaron
for the first time in ages.

11:43.335 --> 11:45.805
I feel guilty,
because at the end of the day,

11:45.871 --> 11:47.606
I fell in love with someone else.

11:55.114 --> 11:58.384
As Marnie's cousin, I know
she never meant to hurt Aaron.

11:58.451 --> 12:02.922
But it'd be such a shame if they
this friendship away over this.

12:08.828 --> 12:10.362
I'm in a radge mood.

12:10.429 --> 12:13.199
So, who better to dry hump
than me radge pal Chloe?

12:19.305 --> 12:22.541
I don't want things to go back
to the way they were with Chloe.

12:22.608 --> 12:24.877
Last time we left Napa,
we left as friends.

12:24.944 --> 12:26.846
And that's all it's ever gonna be.

12:32.718 --> 12:33.719
Promise, never?

12:33.786 --> 12:36.388
We've made a pact
to get with no-one in the house,

12:36.455 --> 12:39.258
and when he gets bored,
I'll be standing right there.

12:39.325 --> 12:41.360
God, I'm so fucking clever, me, like.

12:51.871 --> 12:55.040
I'm having a mint night.
This is what it's all about.

12:55.107 --> 12:58.144
Everyone having good craic
and dancing our arses off.

13:04.150 --> 13:07.653
Nothing ends the night
like being swilled.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.990
I fucking smell like a pub carpet.
Cheers, Gary.

13:24.303 --> 13:25.371
Raaah!

13:25.437 --> 13:27.840
The best way to end a night
is obviously

13:27.907 --> 13:31.810
to eat some long, dirty kebab.

13:33.012 --> 13:35.581
I'm pissed, all I care about
is eating this food,

13:35.648 --> 13:39.518
and someone hoys a chicken nugget.
Fuck it, food fight!

13:42.721 --> 13:45.024
I don't know who started
that food fight,

13:45.090 --> 13:47.226
but I'm gonna fucking finish it.
No!

13:48.394 --> 13:53.399
Fuck you. I can't believe these two
are wasting all this food.

13:53.465 --> 13:56.068
That should be a crime
against chicken nuggets.

13:56.135 --> 14:00.206
They should be arrested.
Do it, Gaz! Don't be a bitch!

14:00.272 --> 14:02.374
(laughs)
Oh, Gary.

14:02.441 --> 14:05.411
I wish that wasn't ketchup
you squirted all over my face.

14:05.477 --> 14:07.780
How about something else?
Fuck you.

14:07.846 --> 14:11.250
Tonight has been amazing. I might
not have spoken to Aaron yet,

14:11.317 --> 14:15.221
but at least when we don't speak,
we can't argue. Nathan, hot tub!

14:15.287 --> 14:18.157
Hot tub! No way I'm going
in the hot tub with that lot.

14:18.224 --> 14:20.492
They're covered in kebab.
I'm off to bed.

14:26.999 --> 14:29.435
When a girl's gotta go,
she's got to go.

14:31.904 --> 14:34.974
This is definitely one of
the best nights out we've had.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.909
I've ended the night in the hot tub.

14:36.976 --> 14:39.144
Nathan, come on then,
give us a cuddle.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.579
I'm sorry.

14:40.646 --> 14:43.849
I'm pure pissed out me head
and the sight of Marty's todger

14:43.916 --> 14:45.451
has got us pure horny.

14:51.357 --> 14:54.560
I'm not kissing Chloe, cos
every time we come in this house,

14:54.627 --> 14:56.428
it ends up getting complicated.

14:57.663 --> 15:01.867
I am gonna stay well clear of Chloe
and her big boobies.

15:01.934 --> 15:03.669
I'm off!

15:04.670 --> 15:08.140
I'm best with Marty
when we're like this, friends.

15:08.207 --> 15:11.844
But the longer I spend in the house,
the more feelings I get for him.

15:11.910 --> 15:13.746
Howay, Nathan, let's get to bed.

15:13.812 --> 15:16.882
Anna'll be here in the morning
to ruin wuh fucking lives.

15:38.504 --> 15:40.773
Oh!

15:40.839 --> 15:42.541
Well, morning, guys.

15:42.608 --> 15:46.245
It's so good to be waking up in the
house with these bunch of idiots.

15:46.312 --> 15:48.180
Last night was absolutely mint.

15:48.247 --> 15:50.549
Charlotte and Holly
would've loved it.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.284
Have you seen it down there?

15:52.351 --> 15:54.486
Nathan, right, you were just on one.

15:54.553 --> 15:56.455
I don't remember the club...

15:56.522 --> 15:59.291
You can't remember anything
about that food fight?

15:59.358 --> 16:02.528
Sophie, how do you expect me to
remember a food fight

16:02.594 --> 16:05.531
when I couldn't even fucking see?
Who wants breakfast?

16:05.597 --> 16:07.666
You bring the brekkie up, girls.

16:10.636 --> 16:13.839
I've woke up this morning,
I'm in a bad, bad way here, like.

16:13.906 --> 16:15.808
But last night was fucking sick.

16:15.874 --> 16:19.645
That was, like, a typical
first night out.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.880
Everyone just went nuts.

16:21.947 --> 16:25.284
Me and Chloe made an agreement
that we weren't gonna get with

16:25.351 --> 16:27.386
other people in the house.
What?!

16:27.453 --> 16:29.655
Marty has made another pact
with Chloe,

16:29.722 --> 16:32.324
and another one
that he's not gonna stick to.

16:32.391 --> 16:34.360
Basically that kid is fucked.

16:34.426 --> 16:36.028
Did you and Marnie speak?

16:36.095 --> 16:37.496
No.

16:37.563 --> 16:38.731
Fucking hell.

16:38.797 --> 16:42.401
I still haven't spoke to Marnie,
and it doesn't fucking bother us.

16:42.468 --> 16:46.305
At the end of the day, she made
her bed, so she can lie in it.

16:46.372 --> 16:49.708
Well, I reckon
we should get showered

16:49.775 --> 16:52.010
and go for some lunch, Gaz. On you.

16:52.077 --> 16:54.780
Aaron wants to go for lunch
and to have a nice day.

16:54.847 --> 16:59.318
The one thing on my mind this morning
is, why did Anna need us back?

16:59.385 --> 17:00.886
And where is she?

17:03.088 --> 17:05.057
Sophie!
What?!

17:05.124 --> 17:06.525
Do you want some bacon?!

17:06.592 --> 17:09.895
Are you kidding? Me dad's Muslim,
you know I don't eat it.

17:09.962 --> 17:11.964
(chuckles)

17:13.999 --> 17:15.000
(indistinct)

17:15.067 --> 17:16.101
(laughs)

17:16.167 --> 17:19.003
We're all chilling out,
a little bit hungover.

17:19.070 --> 17:21.140
Chloe's making some sausages.

17:21.205 --> 17:24.410
You don't surprise me,
sometimes you disgust me.

17:24.476 --> 17:26.078
(giggles)

17:27.713 --> 17:31.150
Ah, don't you touch that.
That's mine, you little fucker.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.456
Morning, all.
Hi, Anna!

17:37.523 --> 17:40.259
Here she is, looking like
a big fucking banana.

17:40.325 --> 17:43.262
Hopefully she's gonna tell us
why the hell we're her.

17:43.328 --> 17:46.965
I hope yous all behaved yourselves
last night. Went out, got pissed,

17:47.032 --> 17:49.001
had a food fight.
You know, the usual.

17:49.067 --> 17:51.003
Of course we behaved ourself, Anna.

17:51.069 --> 17:52.438
Don't we always?

17:52.504 --> 17:53.806
Now, what do you want?

17:53.872 --> 17:57.009
In case you're wondering,
Scotty's on another job for us,

17:57.075 --> 18:00.145
so he won't be joining you.
At all?

18:00.212 --> 18:02.948
What the fuck?
Scott is on another job.

18:03.015 --> 18:06.785
This is really bad because he
is one of the best workers.

18:06.852 --> 18:08.487
We'll be fucked without him.

18:08.554 --> 18:13.091
But business is booming,
so I'm going to need more workers.

18:13.158 --> 18:14.226
What?!

18:14.293 --> 18:18.163
New workers? Oh, my God.
This is exciting.

18:18.230 --> 18:21.800
I need you to put them through their
paces and I need yous to make sure

18:21.867 --> 18:23.168
they're up to the task.

18:23.235 --> 18:25.771
I need your help
to make the right decision.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.574
Hang on a minute.
Anna's putting in new workers

18:28.640 --> 18:31.743
and needs our help to put them
through their paces

18:31.810 --> 18:36.615
and help her make a decision? Anna,
have you seen us at work? We're shit.

18:36.682 --> 18:40.319
Are they living in this house? Yeah,
they're gonna be living in here,

18:40.385 --> 18:42.788
working with you.
This is my dream job.

18:42.855 --> 18:46.492
If people are gonna try and join,
they'll be put through their paces.

18:46.558 --> 18:48.527
We don't let just anybody join.

18:48.594 --> 18:50.863
I need all of your help on this,
all right?

18:50.929 --> 18:53.265
Anna's saying
that she needs new workers.

18:53.332 --> 18:55.667
If them new workers
are gonna be fit birds,

18:55.734 --> 18:57.269
then that is a fucking bonus.

18:57.336 --> 19:01.173
First job tonight, I've got a big
Geordie Tours event lined up. Today?

19:01.240 --> 19:03.509
Today.
We're going to meet them today!

19:03.575 --> 19:05.544
(cheering)

19:05.611 --> 19:07.880
Whoa, we're meeting
the new workers today.

19:07.946 --> 19:11.316
How many is there? Is there boys?
Is there girls? I don't care!

19:11.383 --> 19:14.653
As long as they like turkey
dinosaurs, nuggets and beans!

19:14.720 --> 19:17.923
Do a good job and don't let me down.
Bye! Thanks, Anna! Bye!

19:17.990 --> 19:22.127
I'm excited to meet the newbies. Not
only are they coming here to work,

19:22.194 --> 19:23.929
but they better be able to party,

19:23.996 --> 19:25.998
I can't wait to get mortal
with them.

19:26.064 --> 19:28.567
What are we gonna do?
How are we gonna test them?

19:28.634 --> 19:30.702
Just see,
whatever there is at work...

19:30.769 --> 19:33.338
They need to be able to drink,
still run games...

19:33.405 --> 19:36.975
We wanna see who can handle it.
Yeah. Put them in at the deep end.

19:37.042 --> 19:39.845
It takes a lot to be a full-time
Geordie in this house.

19:39.912 --> 19:43.248
We need someone who can really
drink, who's not a lightweight.

19:43.315 --> 19:46.585
We've already got Aaron and Nathan.
I want them to be funny.

19:46.652 --> 19:48.420
Yeah, same.
Yeah.

19:48.487 --> 19:52.491
We're the ones that's gotta live
with the people Anna chooses.

19:52.558 --> 19:56.228
And I wanna see if they've got what
it takes to be the biggest radgie.

19:56.295 --> 19:58.764
We all know the qualities
of the people we want,

19:58.830 --> 20:01.099
so tonight, we need to
look fucking sick.

20:01.166 --> 20:03.402
We need to look better
than ever before.

20:03.468 --> 20:06.305
OK, Anna, bring it on.

20:06.371 --> 20:08.106
Let's get this party started.

20:23.255 --> 20:24.690
Hello?
Who's that?

20:24.756 --> 20:26.224
Hello!

20:26.291 --> 20:29.328
The door's opened,
and the first one's arrived.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.763
It's a girl.
Hello!

20:31.830 --> 20:33.031
Hi.
(all) Hi.

20:34.466 --> 20:36.301
I'm Abbie, I'm 19.

20:36.368 --> 20:40.505
When I hit the town, it's all about
drinking my bodyweight in vodka

20:40.572 --> 20:42.507
and having a cheeky neck on.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.676
It wouldn't be a good night
without it.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.411
You all right?
Hello.

20:46.478 --> 20:50.682
Tall blonde girl has just walked in.
Thank you, Anna. That'll do nicely.

20:50.749 --> 20:54.119
This girl is nice,
but she's got that much tan on,

20:54.186 --> 20:56.722
she smells like a fucking biscuit.
I'm Marnie.

20:56.788 --> 21:00.058
She's very orange. It looks
like Donald Trump in a dress.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.893
Let's come over the kitchen.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.562
I am absolutely buzzing.

21:03.629 --> 21:06.965
And I'm on the lookout
for tattoos, teeth and tan.

21:07.032 --> 21:09.067
How old are you?
And are you single?

21:09.134 --> 21:10.535
I'm 19. Yes, I'm single.

21:10.602 --> 21:13.705
Oh, she's a freshie!
So's me and Aaron.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.173
(laughs)

21:15.240 --> 21:18.644
Abbie tells us that she's single
and I'm thinking, "Nice."

21:22.848 --> 21:24.650
Who's this?
Oh, here we go.

21:24.716 --> 21:25.984
(all shouting)

21:28.120 --> 21:29.688
Oi, oi!
(cheering)

21:29.755 --> 21:31.189
Is this a wind-up?

21:31.256 --> 21:33.125
(farts) Oh, my God.

21:33.191 --> 21:37.295
I'm trying not to choke on Nathan's
fart and the door opens. Hello!

21:37.362 --> 21:39.097
What the hell is Anna up to?

21:39.164 --> 21:40.766
This is to your first work.

21:42.868 --> 21:46.271
And I can't help but think that
Abbie looks like a great kisser.

21:46.672 --> 21:48.674
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

21:51.510 --> 21:51.710
.

21:54.212 --> 21:54.413
.

22:06.124 --> 22:08.126
Who's this?
(all shouting)

22:08.193 --> 22:11.930
Anna's telling us she's sending
new people in to help with work.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.566
We're just getting to know
the first one, Abbie,

22:14.633 --> 22:17.202
when we hear another
fucking car door.

22:21.707 --> 22:23.975
Oi, oi!
(cheering)

22:25.043 --> 22:27.179
How you doing? What's your name?
Sarah.

22:27.245 --> 22:30.182
I'm Sarah, I'm 23,
and I am a classy girl.

22:30.248 --> 22:34.786
It takes anyone a good few dates
before they get to dust this.

22:34.853 --> 22:36.321
How are you?

22:36.388 --> 22:39.891
This new girl, Sarah,
seems like a really sweet girl.

22:39.958 --> 22:43.895
But we just won't know if she's got
what it takes to be a Geordie girl.

22:43.962 --> 22:45.130
Only time will tell.

22:47.466 --> 22:48.567
Is this a wind-up?

22:50.135 --> 22:51.136
Been a while.

22:51.203 --> 22:54.372
Sarah is very cute,
but she's also Marty's ex.

22:54.439 --> 22:56.608
So, this could be very interesting.

22:56.675 --> 22:58.410
Who wants a drink?
Me!

22:58.477 --> 22:59.478
I need one.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.747
An ex is supposed to be in the past.

23:01.813 --> 23:05.183
And now she's in my house,
living with the lad I like.

23:05.250 --> 23:07.786
And I don't actually know what to do.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.558
This would only ever
happen to Chloe.

23:13.625 --> 23:16.528
I don't even know what to say
to make her feel better.

23:16.595 --> 23:19.331
Cheers to Sarah and... Abbie.
Cheers to me ex-bird.

23:19.397 --> 23:21.733
(cheering)
We're all sat having a drink,

23:21.800 --> 23:24.069
but I haven't come in here
as Marty's ex.

23:24.136 --> 23:26.371
I've come in here
to work hard and be myself

23:26.438 --> 23:28.406
and hopefully everyone'll like us.

23:28.473 --> 23:30.809
Marty,
why don't you tell us about Sarah?

23:30.876 --> 23:32.277
She's 22...
I'm 23.

23:32.344 --> 23:34.546
(laughter)

23:34.613 --> 23:37.649
Everyone's talking to Sarah,
and I feel awkward as fuck.

23:37.716 --> 23:40.485
Time to get the lads
and fuck off to the bedroom.

23:40.552 --> 23:44.189
I've got fucking nae chance of doing
nowt now. Chloe and me ex-bird?

23:44.256 --> 23:47.292
Yo, man, the two of them will
come together and just go bam!

23:47.359 --> 23:49.961
Me ex-bird Sarah's here
and Chloe's here as well.

23:50.028 --> 23:53.565
Cracking on with new birds is gonna
be even more of a challenge.

23:53.632 --> 23:55.600
But it's not gonna stop me, though.

23:55.667 --> 23:57.936
Oh, I feel for you.
I feel for you, cuz.

23:58.003 --> 24:00.472
Marty, you are fucked.

24:01.606 --> 24:02.908
Give us a cuddle.

24:06.144 --> 24:08.947
Yous both look really, really nice.
Thank you.

24:09.014 --> 24:12.851
Me, Nathan and the girls are trying
to get to know the new workers.

24:12.918 --> 24:15.921
We've got so many questions.
What are you like, Sarah?

24:15.987 --> 24:18.623
I'm a canny unstable person
in general.

24:18.690 --> 24:21.092
(laughter)
I think you'll fit in well.

24:21.159 --> 24:25.063
These new girls,
I want them to be fun, hard-working,

24:25.130 --> 24:28.066
get some banter. I would
love them to be a piss-taker.

24:28.133 --> 24:30.735
If you see lads,
would you neck on with them?

24:30.802 --> 24:33.772
Yeah, I'd have a neck on, yeah.
What about a shag?

24:33.839 --> 24:37.142
It depends. I've got this thing
where, if I like a lad,

24:37.209 --> 24:40.679
I won't shag them. But if I don't
like them, I would shag them.

24:40.745 --> 24:42.280
What planet is this girl on?

24:42.347 --> 24:45.617
The whole thing about shagging
is you shag people you like.

24:45.684 --> 24:47.886
Chloe's got strong feelings
for Martin.

24:47.953 --> 24:50.388
I know you're an ex,
so it's awkward for me.

24:50.455 --> 24:53.058
I'm feeling weird
that Marty's ex is here.

24:53.124 --> 24:55.493
I'm not too sure
that I'm happy about it.

24:55.560 --> 24:58.763
But these girls are new,
I need to make them feel welcome.

24:58.830 --> 25:01.199
I've not come back
to get with Martin.

25:01.266 --> 25:04.736
I'm not Martin's ex, I'm Sarah.
You can learn a lot from Sarah.

25:04.803 --> 25:08.206
Oh, I can give you a few lessons
on how to treat that cunt.

25:08.273 --> 25:09.274
(laughter)

25:15.647 --> 25:17.482
I have to wear it?
Yeah.

25:17.549 --> 25:20.385
I'll make it me own.
You've put it on the wrong way.

25:20.452 --> 25:23.255
Sophie and Chloe are getting
the new girls kitted out

25:23.321 --> 25:26.491
in the shit work outfit.
Me and Marnie are having a gossip.

25:26.558 --> 25:30.829
I find, erm, Sarah very strange.

25:32.397 --> 25:36.101
The new girls are great, but
I'm wondering, where's the sausage?

25:36.167 --> 25:39.237
I want a hot lad to stare at.
Oh, Anna, sort it out.

25:39.304 --> 25:41.506
(farts) Oh, my God.
Right...

25:41.573 --> 25:44.809
I'm full on gonna have a poo.
That's not even funny.

25:50.649 --> 25:52.884
I'm trying not to choke
on Nathan's fart,

25:52.951 --> 25:54.419
and then the door opens.

25:54.486 --> 25:56.488
Hello!
Hiya!

25:56.554 --> 25:58.757
(gasps)
This girl is dead glam.

25:58.823 --> 26:00.525
She's got weave for days.

26:00.592 --> 26:02.227
Where's everyone else?

26:02.294 --> 26:04.296
I'm Zahida, I'm 22.

26:04.362 --> 26:08.767
I'm loud, I'm confident. I like the
way I am and I'm not gonna change.

26:09.668 --> 26:12.604
Please be a boy, please be a boy,
please be a boy, please.

26:12.671 --> 26:16.007
Oh, my God! Where is all
the chopper, for fuck's sake?

26:16.074 --> 26:18.877
And how many more workers
is Anna sending in?

26:19.911 --> 26:21.947
(squeals)

26:22.013 --> 26:24.249
What's this?
Do they know each other?

26:24.316 --> 26:27.686
Not only am I excited
to be working for Geordie Tours,

26:27.752 --> 26:30.722
it looks like I'm working
with me best friend, Sarah.

26:30.789 --> 26:32.090
This is wicked.

26:32.891 --> 26:37.028
New worker number three has arrived,
and it's another girl.

26:37.095 --> 26:40.165
She rocks in in quite a
revealing outfit, looks quite fun,

26:40.231 --> 26:42.600
quite flirty, she looks up for it.
Hello.

26:42.667 --> 26:44.336
My name's Sophie.
I'm Zahida.

26:44.402 --> 26:48.106
It was all fun to start off with,
but I'm starting to feel worried.

26:48.173 --> 26:49.941
What the hell is Anna up to?

26:50.008 --> 26:53.078
I hope to God us originals
are all safe.

26:53.144 --> 26:56.281
So, it's us at work, yeah?
Yous aren't going to work,

26:56.348 --> 26:59.884
you're gonna meet us after. Zahida,
you're coming to work with us.

26:59.951 --> 27:02.654
Lads, time to put the newbies
through their paces,

27:02.721 --> 27:05.357
see if they've got what it takes
to join our crew.

27:05.423 --> 27:07.459
The rest of yous,
see you at the club.

27:07.525 --> 27:10.695
We need to get ready. Girls,
I'll show yous to your new room.

27:10.762 --> 27:12.263
(chatter)

27:19.571 --> 27:21.139
See you later.

27:21.206 --> 27:23.141
For once, I'm buzzing to go to work.

27:23.208 --> 27:26.444
We might be on the lookout for
what Anna wants as a new worker,

27:26.511 --> 27:29.381
but I'm gonna be looking
who I want in that shag pad.

27:29.447 --> 27:30.982
Gnash on.

27:31.049 --> 27:34.519
I'm buzzing. This is a mint
opportunity to show the lads

27:34.586 --> 27:37.322
I've got what it takes
to be part of the team.

27:37.389 --> 27:38.790
Bye.

27:40.358 --> 27:42.127
Woo!

27:46.998 --> 27:50.802
I think Abbie'll be good at work,
cos she'll be very good. I like her.

27:50.869 --> 27:53.571
Yeah. I cannot wait to see
what that Sarah's like.

27:53.638 --> 27:55.774
The one good thing
about this situation

27:55.840 --> 27:57.776
is that, for once,
we get to step back

27:57.842 --> 28:00.245
and not do any work.
It's all for the newbies.

28:00.311 --> 28:02.180
It's like an ideal world.

28:02.247 --> 28:05.116
I think Zahida'll be good for a job.
She's loud like us.

28:05.183 --> 28:08.720
I think she'll be good to work with,
but not good to live with.

28:08.787 --> 28:11.523
There's just something
I don't trust about Zahida.

28:11.589 --> 28:13.425
I'll be keeping a close eye on her.

28:13.491 --> 28:16.961
Anyone notice that I'm very green?
Cos you've mixed two tans.

28:17.028 --> 28:19.564
I look like The Hulk.
(laughs)

28:25.837 --> 28:28.840
This is our first job for Anna.
Abbie, Sarah and Zahida,

28:28.907 --> 28:32.677
this is their chance to shine. So,
we need to get these punters mortal

28:32.744 --> 28:34.446
and think of some crazy games.

28:34.512 --> 28:37.182
This is to your three's first work.

28:37.248 --> 28:39.717
Good luck. Cheers, everyone.

28:39.784 --> 28:43.721
Let's get this party started. Best
way to do that is with some shots.

28:43.788 --> 28:46.624
Right, everyone, shut up
and listen to us, please.

28:46.691 --> 28:49.427
Go on, Zahida.
I'm just about to explain the games,

28:49.494 --> 28:52.464
when Zahida walks over
and takes the megaphone off me.

28:52.530 --> 28:54.866
I love this. Less work for me.

28:54.933 --> 28:58.369
When I shout "Geordie",
you shout "tours".

28:58.436 --> 28:59.938
Geordie!
(all) Tours!

29:00.004 --> 29:01.339
Geordie!
(all) Tours!

29:01.406 --> 29:03.208
Louder! Geordie!
(all) Tours!

29:03.274 --> 29:05.944
Zahida is literally
firing up the punters.

29:06.010 --> 29:08.179
So far, she's looking like a natural.

29:08.246 --> 29:11.282
Two, one!
(cheering)

29:13.084 --> 29:16.988
Work is so much fun.
I'm having the best time.

29:17.055 --> 29:18.857
And it looks like Sarah is, too.

29:18.923 --> 29:21.559
(cheering)

29:23.027 --> 29:26.264
Sarah is drinking the clients drinks
straight away.

29:26.331 --> 29:29.868
The smartest move I've seen from
a new worker. What are you doing?

29:29.934 --> 29:31.069
You're at work, man!

29:31.136 --> 29:33.505
Can I have two boys, please?

29:33.571 --> 29:34.906
I think this one.

29:37.575 --> 29:41.346
I guess I should do some work.
And I'm really good at kissing.

29:41.412 --> 29:42.514
Go!

29:45.850 --> 29:49.220
These girls are proper good craic.
They're not holding back,

29:49.287 --> 29:52.624
and I can't help but think that
Abbie looks like a great kisser.

29:52.690 --> 29:54.492
Right, stop kissing!

29:54.559 --> 29:55.593
(shouting)

29:56.995 --> 30:01.099
There is one clear winner here,
and it's Sarah and this boy here.

30:01.166 --> 30:03.001
(all chanting)

30:03.067 --> 30:05.203
I'm actually having
a mint time at work.

30:05.270 --> 30:08.139
Us girls are showing them
that we're grafters.

30:08.206 --> 30:11.743
Thank you all for coming tonight.
That's the end of Geordie Tours,

30:11.809 --> 30:13.845
we'll be back again soon.
(cheering)

30:13.912 --> 30:16.481
Best thing about having
all these new people is,

30:16.548 --> 30:18.049
we don't have to do fuck all.

30:18.116 --> 30:20.485
I can just stand here
and look pretty.

30:20.552 --> 30:22.353
Woo!

30:28.293 --> 30:31.162
Me and the others are getting ready
to smash the Toon.

30:31.229 --> 30:33.698
I'm excited to see
what the new girls are like.

30:33.765 --> 30:34.999
Come on, guys!

30:44.676 --> 30:47.145
Party!

30:47.212 --> 30:50.815
With us not having to go to work,
we've arrived, early birds,

30:50.882 --> 30:53.284
at the club first.
You know what that means.

30:53.351 --> 30:55.987
Oi, oi, more drinks for us.

30:56.054 --> 30:58.656
Cheers, everyone!
Here's to a good night!

30:58.723 --> 31:00.959
(cheering)

31:01.025 --> 31:03.228
Woo-hoo!
Yeah, boy!

31:03.294 --> 31:06.064
The tunes are bouncing,
the vodka's flowing,

31:06.130 --> 31:08.299
and my dancing is on point.

31:08.366 --> 31:11.336
And I cannot wait for
the others to get here.

31:28.519 --> 31:31.456
Things are never easy for Chloe
when it comes to Marty.

31:31.522 --> 31:34.692
And now that his ex is here,
I need to be a good best friend

31:34.759 --> 31:37.829
and make sure I know how Chloe feels
and what's going on.

31:46.170 --> 31:50.208
Last night, Marty made a pact that he
wouldn't get with anyone in the house

31:50.275 --> 31:52.610
but his ex is here.
Anything could change.

31:56.547 --> 31:59.784
I need to know if she's got
any feelings for him whatsoever,

31:59.851 --> 32:01.586
cos that could ruin everything.

32:01.653 --> 32:04.522
But right now, I'm gonna have a drink
and enjoy meself.

32:17.235 --> 32:19.804
For us lads,
work's been a piece of piss.

32:19.871 --> 32:23.841
We're gonna have a little catch up
and discuss the new girls.

32:30.748 --> 32:33.051
If I had to put the girls
on a leader board,

32:33.117 --> 32:35.053
it goes Zahida, Abbie, then Sarah.

32:35.119 --> 32:37.121
But I've had a laugh
with all of them.

32:37.188 --> 32:39.123
I could live with any of them.

32:44.395 --> 32:47.699
All in all, work went
fucking amazing. I'm impressed.

32:47.765 --> 32:50.368
But now it's time to ditch work,
go clubbing

32:50.435 --> 32:51.803
and get smashed.

32:59.143 --> 33:00.611
Chloe's going off at Sarah.

33:03.047 --> 33:04.515
Why's Sophie involved?

33:07.085 --> 33:09.754
I am fucking seeing red.
Kick-off Chloe is back.

33:11.389 --> 33:13.124
That was fucking out of order.

33:13.191 --> 33:15.159
You always fucking do that!

33:15.226 --> 33:18.029
I'm so upset.
I just want to go home.

33:19.664 --> 33:21.666
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

33:23.968 --> 33:24.168
.

33:26.671 --> 33:26.871
.

33:40.585 --> 33:44.422
We get to the club and so far,
the newbies have smashed work.

33:44.489 --> 33:46.624
But if they're gonna live with us,

33:46.691 --> 33:50.027
we need to know if they
can keep up with us on a night out.

33:55.266 --> 33:59.704
Anna wants us to take the newbies
under our wing. Bring it on.

34:04.041 --> 34:07.845
(Sophie) Fair play. It looks like the
newbies snuck a few drinks at work.

34:07.912 --> 34:12.116
But rule number one for wanting
to work with us Geordies.

34:12.183 --> 34:14.318
You've got to handle your booze.

34:22.326 --> 34:24.295
(Sarah) I am having a mint night.

34:24.362 --> 34:27.465
So far, they've made all us newbies
feel proper welcome.

34:34.272 --> 34:38.643
I'm desperate to know
how these newbies have got along.

34:38.708 --> 34:41.746
I hope they haven't done that well,
because fuck that.

34:41.813 --> 34:43.648
I don't want them taking my job.

34:55.993 --> 35:01.799
Whoa, whoa, whoa. So Zahida
has came in and stole my chant.

35:01.866 --> 35:04.168
That girl is not short
of confidence.

35:13.744 --> 35:16.481
I am having the best night.

35:16.547 --> 35:19.584
I'm absolutely mortal
from all the shots at work.

35:19.650 --> 35:22.186
Now my best dance moves
are coming out.

35:26.324 --> 35:29.627
Me and Marnie haven't spoken
since we came into the house.

35:29.694 --> 35:31.162
I know I said I didn't care.

35:31.229 --> 35:34.065
I'm gonna be the bigger man
and go and speak to her.

35:35.399 --> 35:38.769
The first thing she says
is she likes my hair.

35:38.836 --> 35:41.005
Eh? I haven't got any hair, Marns.

35:44.575 --> 35:47.211
Oh, my God.
Aaron's came over and spoken to us.

35:47.278 --> 35:50.081
I am so relieved.
I've been worried about this.

35:55.152 --> 35:58.189
(Marty) I think Marnie
couldn't give a fuck about Aaron.

35:58.256 --> 36:00.124
It's best if they don't speak.

36:00.191 --> 36:02.460
She's got a boyfriend
and he's moved on.

36:02.527 --> 36:06.063
It'll save arguments if they stay
out of each other's way.

36:11.836 --> 36:14.405
Marnie's asking if
I fancy any of the new girls.

36:14.472 --> 36:16.741
So far, I'm quite impressed
with Abbie.

36:16.807 --> 36:19.243
But I'm not gonna tell her that.

36:19.310 --> 36:21.479
The last thing I want
is an argument.

36:22.713 --> 36:25.049
I'm so happy
that me and Aaron have spoken.

36:25.116 --> 36:27.518
Hopefully now we can get along
with no dramas

36:27.585 --> 36:29.453
and have a really good night.

36:36.327 --> 36:39.363
We're having a good night
and we're absolutely smashed.

36:39.430 --> 36:43.167
I can see in the corner of my eye,
Chloe is talking to Marty's ex.

36:43.234 --> 36:46.370
And she's mortal.
This is not gonna end well.

36:51.475 --> 36:55.212
I look over and surprise, surprise,
Chloe's going off at Sarah.

36:55.279 --> 36:56.514
I bet it's about Marty.

36:59.317 --> 37:02.486
Aaron's telling me
that Chloe is going in on Sarah.

37:02.553 --> 37:05.289
There's nae way
I'm getting involved in that.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.095
Things are getting
a little bit heated.

37:11.162 --> 37:12.863
I've gotta make sure Chloe is OK

37:12.930 --> 37:16.534
because I'm not having these newbies
come in and cause trouble.

37:21.973 --> 37:25.443
I can understand Chloe wanting
to speak to Sarah about Marty.

37:25.509 --> 37:28.913
But why is Sophie getting involved
and upsetting me best friend?

37:35.186 --> 37:38.322
I'm not gonna lie,
I'm not crazy about Zahida.

37:38.389 --> 37:41.926
I feel like she's targeted me
to push me out of this house.

37:49.834 --> 37:53.037
Why is it, every time
new girls come in this house,

37:53.104 --> 37:54.772
the girls always kick off?

37:54.839 --> 37:57.708
Let's get out of this club
before things get any worse.

38:11.589 --> 38:14.291
Fucking hell.
These newbies can't hack it.

38:15.993 --> 38:18.829
Marty's been flirting with Zahida
all the way home.

38:18.896 --> 38:22.400
It looks like he had a little bit
of a fiddle with her fanny.

38:22.466 --> 38:25.069
Good luck with that
when Chloe finds out, Zahida.

38:26.804 --> 38:27.805
Fuck off.

38:32.176 --> 38:34.612
What? Am I hearing this right?

38:34.679 --> 38:36.614
Marty fingered Zahida

38:36.681 --> 38:39.250
when everyone knows
I've got a thing for him?

38:39.316 --> 38:42.486
This whole time I've been worried
about his ex. I'm foaming.

38:42.553 --> 38:45.389
Someone's getting fingered!
Who?

38:45.456 --> 38:47.124
Oops.

38:47.191 --> 38:50.961
It was him! Fingering Zahida!
Ooh!

38:51.028 --> 38:53.698
What the actual fuck? Howay.

38:53.764 --> 38:54.965
Why would I?

38:56.367 --> 39:00.371
Chloe starts shouting about Marty
fingering Zahida in the taxi.

39:00.438 --> 39:03.841
I was in the taxi, Chloe.
Nothing happened.

39:03.908 --> 39:06.577
No. Don't fucking stand there,
right!

39:06.644 --> 39:09.547
Yeah, whatever.
Who the fuck are you talking to?

39:09.613 --> 39:12.183
Whoa, whoa. I might be partly
to blame here,

39:12.249 --> 39:14.585
but do not start on my Chloe.

39:14.652 --> 39:18.656
Fuck off. You're a fucking idiot!
Fuck off!

39:18.723 --> 39:20.458
What the fuck is going on?

39:20.524 --> 39:23.360
We came here to work for Anna
and to have fun.

39:23.427 --> 39:25.362
Don't fucking... (shrieks)

39:25.429 --> 39:28.332
I am fucking seeing red.
Kick-off Chloe is back.

39:29.333 --> 39:31.268
(screams)

39:31.335 --> 39:32.536
Fuck off!

39:32.603 --> 39:35.940
(Marnie) Chloe's pulled out
all of Zahida's extensions.

39:36.006 --> 39:38.342
It's getting messy
and I don't like it.

39:38.409 --> 39:40.344
I've done fuck all!

39:40.411 --> 39:45.416
I have never been this fucking angry!
Who the fuck does she think she is?

39:45.483 --> 39:46.917
What? What?

39:49.687 --> 39:52.289
(Marnie) Chloe! Get off her now!

39:52.356 --> 39:53.991
What the fuck have I done?

39:56.293 --> 39:58.329
I've seen some fights in this house,

39:58.395 --> 40:01.132
but Chloe, that is actually
fucking disgusting.

40:01.198 --> 40:02.767
(shouting)

40:05.436 --> 40:08.439
I don't think, in the whole time
I've ever known Chloe,

40:08.506 --> 40:10.608
for her to be this aggressive.

40:10.674 --> 40:12.576
It's fucking awful to see.

40:12.643 --> 40:15.546
That was fucking out of order! No!

40:15.613 --> 40:16.847
(Aaron) In this house,

40:16.914 --> 40:20.084
you've got to have good crack
and be able to drink and argue.

40:20.151 --> 40:23.854
But this fight's fucking disgusting.
What a way to welcome a newbie.

40:23.921 --> 40:26.123
Anna is gonna be fucking fuming
with you.

40:26.190 --> 40:28.626
I'm going. Fuck that shit.

40:33.197 --> 40:37.134
All I wanted to do
was make a good impression.

40:37.201 --> 40:40.671
I'm so upset.
I just want to go home.

40:45.209 --> 40:48.445
Whilst this lot argue,
I'm gonna check that Zahida's OK

40:48.512 --> 40:50.581
cos that was fucking out of order.

40:50.648 --> 40:53.184
This might seem like
the end of the world,

40:53.250 --> 40:55.853
but in this house,
we recover from fights.

40:55.920 --> 40:58.823
I know, but I just don't...
I haven't done anything.

40:58.889 --> 41:02.226
I know you haven't. That's why
I've come outside to find you.

41:02.293 --> 41:04.662
I brought my fucking dinner
to make sure.

41:04.728 --> 41:08.199
I'm so grateful
that Nathan's come out to see us.

41:08.265 --> 41:11.402
But where the fuck
did he get that roast dinner?

41:16.173 --> 41:18.776
I am so shocked
at Chloe's behaviour tonight.

41:18.843 --> 41:21.812
I need to find out
where the hell it all came from.

41:21.879 --> 41:24.615
That came from you.
I didn't say it!

41:24.682 --> 41:27.384
Here we go again.
Chloe not remembering stuff.

41:27.451 --> 41:28.586
She did it in Kavos.

41:28.652 --> 41:31.188
She needs to start
taking responsibility.

41:31.255 --> 41:33.257
You made it up yourself.

41:33.324 --> 41:34.792
You made it up yourself.

41:36.026 --> 41:37.895
Who, then, Chloe?
I don't know!

41:37.962 --> 41:39.864
You always fucking do that!

41:39.930 --> 41:41.599
Oh, my God. Marnie is going off.

41:41.665 --> 41:45.803
There's no way I could tell her
that it was me who told Chloe.

41:45.870 --> 41:47.838
It's fucking disgusting, man.

41:47.905 --> 41:50.641
I'm not about that shit.
I'm not about that.

41:55.613 --> 41:58.182
The new workers being here
has caused havoc.

41:58.249 --> 42:00.417
I'm actually embarrassed.

42:00.484 --> 42:03.520
If this is what happens when
Anna sends three new workers,

42:03.587 --> 42:07.057
I hope she's not sending any more.
It's best everyone goes to bed.

42:07.124 --> 42:09.560
Chloe better apologise
in the morning.

42:17.368 --> 42:21.105
My first day at work
has been absolutely awful.

42:21.171 --> 42:24.742
I'm just glad me best friend Sarah
doesn't believe this rumour.

42:24.808 --> 42:26.844
At least I've still got her.

42:32.683 --> 42:36.020
I just want to apologise
for my behaviour.

42:36.086 --> 42:39.156
Oh, shit.
Where the fuck did Anna come from?

42:39.223 --> 42:41.492
Are you all right?
Not holding a grudge.

42:41.558 --> 42:43.127
Chloe, I need to send you home

42:43.193 --> 42:45.496
to think about
how you treat other people.

42:45.562 --> 42:48.866
Losing my job over a stupid fight,
it's so disgusting.

42:50.434 --> 42:53.203
She's meant to have a boyfriend.

42:53.270 --> 42:55.472
I may have let him
slip a cheeky finger.

42:56.440 --> 42:59.743
More workers?
That's how you make an entrance.

42:59.810 --> 43:01.745
I'm not gonna be taking them all on.

43:01.812 --> 43:04.248
We only want the best of the best.

43:05.516 --> 43:07.284
Everyone is fucked.

43:07.351 --> 43:10.020
Your fate is in our hands.

43:10.087 --> 43:12.356
We want the funnest person
to live with.

43:38.449 --> 43:38.649
.
