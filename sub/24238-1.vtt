00:19.830 --> 00:22.472
<i> You had an affair,
and now she's pregnant?</i>

00:25.016 --> 00:26.727
<i>That's great news. I'm so happy...</i>

00:31.130 --> 00:33.715
<i> Queen of angels.</i>

00:41.630 --> 00:43.670
Last time I ever drink like that.

00:47.210 --> 00:49.185
Yeah, right.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.630
Tell us another one, John.

01:04.959 --> 01:06.335
Jesus!

01:06.464 --> 01:08.054
I must be still dreaming.

01:15.694 --> 01:17.300
No, definitely not dreaming.

01:21.170 --> 01:22.331
What are you?

01:22.710 --> 01:24.835
We're you, Johnny.

01:24.870 --> 01:26.398
Like hell you are.

01:30.290 --> 01:33.675
"Materialized psychisms,"
Jung called us.

01:33.710 --> 01:37.215
Projections from the unconscious.

01:37.250 --> 01:42.095
Your own inner demons
given physical form.

01:42.130 --> 01:43.755
Oh, that's not good.

01:43.790 --> 01:45.505
And the only way I'm going to stop

01:45.540 --> 01:49.920
you nasty little buggers
is to take you back.

02:17.998 --> 02:21.255
Something opened a door between
my conscious and unconscious mind

02:21.290 --> 02:22.452
and let them out.

02:22.830 --> 02:24.045
That's never happened before.

02:26.391 --> 02:28.606
Christ. We don't want any!

02:28.642 --> 02:31.312
<i>- Open the bloody door, John.</i>
- Chas?

02:39.224 --> 02:41.322
Maybe this isn't a good time.

02:41.763 --> 02:44.013
It's never a good time, mate.

02:49.170 --> 02:52.159
- You look like shit.
- Oh, thanks, mate.

02:52.534 --> 02:56.382
And how have you been this past,
what is it, nine years? Ten?

02:56.418 --> 02:59.533
Since you spewed up all over
Renee's auntie at the wedding.

03:00.186 --> 03:01.991
Ah, she took it well, I thought.

03:02.027 --> 03:04.045
The auntie, not Renee.

03:04.180 --> 03:07.600
So, you two lived
happily ever after, eh?

03:10.796 --> 03:12.101
Not exactly.

03:12.273 --> 03:14.270
We've been separated for seven months.

03:15.080 --> 03:17.295
Who did you shag then, knob-head?

03:17.330 --> 03:18.490
Nobody.

03:19.188 --> 03:22.215
If it was as simple as that,
maybe we could've...

03:22.250 --> 03:23.745
Could've what?

03:24.494 --> 03:26.319
Ah, I don't know.

03:26.836 --> 03:28.700
We were happy, we really were.

03:29.192 --> 03:31.097
In the past few years,

03:31.608 --> 03:33.678
I've been in a kind of dark place.

03:34.479 --> 03:36.069
Pushing Renee away.

03:36.365 --> 03:37.924
Drinking myself sick.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.370
I, uh...

03:42.210 --> 03:44.794
You what?

03:44.978 --> 03:46.818
I thought I was past it, John.

03:47.540 --> 03:48.925
After all this time.

03:51.944 --> 03:53.635
I thought I was past it.

03:53.670 --> 03:55.511
Why are you here, Chas?

03:55.749 --> 03:57.413
It's not for marital advice,

03:57.449 --> 03:58.896
and it's not 'cause you've
missed me all these years.

03:58.920 --> 03:59.965
That's for sure.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.332
Maybe I have.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.826
You were my best mate, John.

04:04.389 --> 04:05.889
Since we were 10 years old.

04:06.873 --> 04:08.334
Why are you here?

04:08.370 --> 04:12.693
Since Renee kicked me out,
it's like my whole world's gone dark.

04:14.514 --> 04:17.389
Only decent thing I've been able
to hold on to is my little girl.

04:17.574 --> 04:20.795
- You have a kid?
- She's eight years old.

04:20.829 --> 04:23.215
I sent you a bloody announcement
when she was born.

04:23.250 --> 04:25.425
Hmm, must've missed that one.

04:25.660 --> 04:29.370
Tricia is... She's the
only light in my world.

04:30.720 --> 04:33.840
The only hope, and, uh...

04:34.640 --> 04:35.810
What?

04:41.790 --> 04:43.400
She's in a coma.

04:43.924 --> 04:47.214
Doctors haven't a clue what
caused it or how to cure it.

04:47.497 --> 04:51.904
But I've spent enough time around you
to smell the stink of dark magic.

04:52.444 --> 04:54.293
It's convenient to pin our troubles

04:54.329 --> 04:56.680
on some devil lurking
in the shadows, Chas.

04:56.716 --> 05:00.505
But sometimes shitty things
happen because

05:00.540 --> 05:02.772
<i>that's just the way the world is.</i>

05:02.808 --> 05:06.258
<i> Just come have a look at her.
That's all I'm asking.</i>
