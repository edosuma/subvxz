WEBVTT

00:04.038 --> 00:06.274
HEY, MAX.
HEY, VERONICA.

00:06.274 --> 00:11.112
LOOKS LIKE VERONICA MADE IT
THROUGH ANOTHER DAY AT WORK.

00:11.112 --> 00:15.649
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU ACTUALLY GOT
YOUR SPOILED NIECE TO GET A JOB.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.651
WHEN HER MOM DIED,
SHE KNEW I WAS THE MAN

00:17.651 --> 00:19.653
TO MOLD HER CHILD
INTO A RESPONSIBLE ADULT.

00:19.653 --> 00:23.357
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
TILL I GET MY OWN REALITY SHOW.

00:24.658 --> 00:28.362
"GEORGE LOPEZ:
RESCUE NANNY 9-JUAN-JUAN."

00:31.865 --> 00:34.902
I'LL BE LIKE, "FINE, MIRA,
GO AHEAD, SUCK YOUR THUMB,

00:34.902 --> 00:37.138
"SUCK YOUR THUMB.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.672
"BUT WHEN YOU FALL ASLEEP,

00:38.672 --> 00:40.741
"I'M GONNA PUT
CHILI ON 'EM,"

00:40.741 --> 00:43.111
AND THEN THE BABY
WAKE UP LIKE THAT...

00:43.111 --> 00:44.778
(chokes)

00:44.778 --> 00:47.815
GEORGE, COME ON,
DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF.

00:47.815 --> 00:49.817
THE ONLY REASON
SHE'S LISTENING TO YOU

00:49.817 --> 00:51.685
IS BECAUSE YOU ARE
IN CHARGE OF HER INHERITANCE.

00:51.685 --> 00:54.688
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WERE GONNA
GIVE ME MILLIONS OF DOLLARS,

00:54.688 --> 00:58.392
I'D GIVE YOU ANYTHING
YOU WANT, TOO.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.461
MOM, I'VE SEEN GUYS
GET YOU TO DO THINGS

01:00.461 --> 01:04.365
FOR $10... AND A TALLBOY.

01:06.033 --> 01:09.370
SO YOU GOT AN "A" IN HISTORY,

01:09.370 --> 01:11.905
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHEN THE CIVIL WAR ENDED?

01:11.905 --> 01:13.607
BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL,

01:13.607 --> 01:16.310
I HAD MY OWN TRICKS
FOR GETTING GOOD GRADES.

01:16.310 --> 01:19.780
WELL, I WANT TO DO
WHAT YOU DID.

01:21.515 --> 01:25.753
THEN YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A MINISKIRT AND HIGH HEELS.

01:25.753 --> 01:28.856
WHY DON'T YOU GO UPSTAIRS,
THROW IT ON

01:28.856 --> 01:31.125
AND SHOW ME HOW IT WORKS?

01:37.631 --> 01:40.100
NICE TRY.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.737
SO HOW WAS WORK?

01:43.737 --> 01:44.772
IT SUCKED.

01:44.772 --> 01:50.411
EIGHT HOURS ON MY FEET.
I AM DEAD.

01:50.411 --> 01:52.746
YOU'RE A HOSTESS
AT A RESTAURANT.

01:52.746 --> 01:55.115
HOW HARD CAN THAT BE?

01:55.115 --> 01:57.818
"PARTY OF TWO,
YOUR TABLE'S READY."

01:59.953 --> 02:03.090
"OH, MY GOD, I'M SO BEAT.

02:03.090 --> 02:07.127
IF THEY ASK FOR A BOOSTER CHAIR,
I'LL JUST LOSE IT!"

02:09.397 --> 02:12.400
IT IS NOT THAT EASY,
UNCLE GEORGE.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.001
THIS FAMILY CAME IN TODAY,

02:14.001 --> 02:16.470
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO
PRONOUNCE THEIR NAME.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.906
THEY WERE FROM, LIKE,
FREAK-ISTAN OR SOMETHING.

02:18.906 --> 02:22.843
FINALLY, I JUST PICKED UP
THE MICROPHONE AND SAID,

02:22.843 --> 02:26.780
"SHORT, HAIRY FAMILY,
YOUR TABLE'S READY."

02:26.780 --> 02:30.951
VERONICA,
YOU ARE GONNA FEEL SO GREAT

02:30.951 --> 02:34.388
WHEN YOU GET YOUR FIRST PAYCHECK
AT THE END OF THE WEEK. MMM.

02:34.388 --> 02:37.157
WHAT WOULD YOU KNOW
ABOUT A PAYCHECK?

02:38.626 --> 02:40.294
I HAVE A WEDDING PLANNING
BUSINESS

02:40.294 --> 02:42.796
THAT'S DOING VERY WELL,
THANK YOU.

02:42.796 --> 02:45.299
PLEASE. YOUR BUSINESS
IS SO BAD,

02:45.299 --> 02:48.669
PEOPLE FROM NEW ORLEANS
ARE SENDING YOU MONEY.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.813
VERONICA, YOU WANT
SOMETHING TO EAT?

02:59.813 --> 03:02.750
OH, NO, THANKS.
OH, I'M SO TIRED.

03:02.750 --> 03:05.286
I'M JUST GONNA GO
LAY DOWN FOR AWHILE.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.188
YOU SEE THAT?

03:08.188 --> 03:09.923
I'M TURNIN' HER
INTO AN ADULT.

03:09.923 --> 03:13.794
SHE'S TIRED, DEPRESSED,
EYES GLAZED OVER.

03:13.794 --> 03:17.531
I'M NOT GONNA QUIT UNTIL
SHE'S FULL-ON WORKING CLASS!

03:17.531 --> 03:21.535
SMOKIN', DRINKIN', WASTIN'
HER MONEY ON LOTTERY TICKETS.

03:23.136 --> 03:24.438
(knock on door)

03:24.438 --> 03:26.974
GEORGE, ANGIE,
YOU GOTTA SEE THIS!

03:32.946 --> 03:35.249
I STUMBLED ACROSS
THIS WEB SITE CALLED

03:35.249 --> 03:38.151
"I'M JUST A FLY ON THE WALL."

03:38.151 --> 03:39.987
CHECK IT OUT.

03:39.987 --> 03:43.691
YOU GET TO WATCH THIS GIRL
HANG OUT IN HER ROOM.

03:43.691 --> 03:46.394
WHY ARE YOU SHOWING US THIS,
ERNIE?

03:46.394 --> 03:49.530
OH, YOU'LL SEE.

03:49.530 --> 03:53.200
LOOK. SHE DOESN'T TAKE HER
CLOTHES OFF OR ANYTHING.

03:53.200 --> 03:56.937
SHE JUST DOES NORMAL STUFF
LIKE READ OR PAINT HER TOENAILS

03:56.937 --> 04:00.441
OR BRUSH HER LONG,
BEAUTIFUL HAIR 47 TIMES,

04:00.441 --> 04:03.544
JUST LIKE YOU ASKED HER.

04:03.544 --> 04:06.514
(Angie) OH, MY GOD.

04:06.514 --> 04:09.417
THAT'S VERONICA!
UH-HUH.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.984
THAT'S OUR SPARE ROOM!
YEAH.

04:10.984 --> 04:14.722
SHE GETS $10 A MONTH
FROM EVERY GUY WHO SUBSCRIBES.

04:14.722 --> 04:19.126
YOU PAID MONEY
TO PEEK AT MY NIECE?!

04:19.126 --> 04:22.029
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS HER!

04:22.029 --> 04:25.999
HER BACK WAS TO THE CAMERA
WHEN SHE WAS BRUSHING HER HAIR.

04:25.999 --> 04:29.703
YOU PAID MONEY TO SEE
A WOMAN BRUSH HER HAIR?

04:29.703 --> 04:33.106
HEY, I DON'T STEAL,
I DON'T HURT PEOPLE.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.275
THIS IS MY THING!

04:37.445 --> 04:39.880
THAT'S IT. SHOW'S OVER.
WHAT SHOW?

04:39.880 --> 04:42.015
LOOK, I KNOW ABOUT
YOUR WEB SITE.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.384
WHERE'S THE CAMERA?

04:43.384 --> 04:44.985
(computer chimes)
WHAT'S THAT NOISE?

04:44.985 --> 04:47.120
MY SUBSCRIBERS.
THEY'RE INSTANT MESSAGING ME.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.823
YEAH, WELL, TELL THOSE FREAKS
THAT THE SHOW'S OVER.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.459
ACTUALLY,
THIS ONE'S FOR YOU.

04:51.459 --> 04:54.695
"JHope" IN IRVINE WANTS YOU
TO TAKE YOUR SHIRT OFF

04:54.695 --> 04:56.930
AND DO SOME JUMPING JACKS.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.535
YOU LISTEN TO ME, PERVERT!

05:01.535 --> 05:03.804
(computer chimes)

05:03.804 --> 05:06.407
HE'S WILLING TO PAY YOU
100 BUCKS.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.241
100 BUCKS?!

05:08.241 --> 05:11.111
NO DEAL.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.346
SO LONG, SICKO!

05:12.346 --> 05:14.081
OH!

05:14.081 --> 05:17.284
WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOIN'?
WE'RE NOT DONE HERE!

05:17.284 --> 05:20.253
AS LONG AS YOU'RE IN MY HOUSE,
YOU LIVE BY MY RULES!

05:20.253 --> 05:22.590
WHY ARE YOU WIGGING OUT
ABOUT THIS?!

05:22.590 --> 05:25.092
IT'S NOT LIKE I GOT NAKED
OR ANYTHING.

05:25.092 --> 05:28.629
OH, IT'S TRUE.
SHE DIDN'T.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.831
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

05:30.831 --> 05:33.567
YOU HAVE A JOB
AT THE RESTAURANT.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.302
WELL, NOT ANYMORE.

05:35.302 --> 05:36.937
WHAT HAPPENED?

05:36.937 --> 05:41.675
I TRIED REALLY HARD, I DID,
BUT IT GOT SO BUSY.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.612
RIGHT WHEN I WAS HUNGRY
AND WANTED TO TAKE MY BREAK,

05:44.612 --> 05:47.648
ALL THESE PEOPLE CAME
RUSHING IN.

05:47.648 --> 05:50.684
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT IN
THE RESTAURANT MANAGEMENT GAME,

05:50.684 --> 05:55.355
BUT I THINK
THEY CALL THAT "DINNER."

05:55.355 --> 05:58.626
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU LIED TO US.

05:58.626 --> 05:59.893
LOOK, I'M NOT GIVING
YOU YOUR INHERITANCE

05:59.893 --> 06:02.129
UNTIL YOU PROVE TO US
YOU'RE MATURE ENOUGH,

06:02.129 --> 06:04.131
AND YOU JUST TOOK
A HUGE STEP BACKWARDS.

06:04.131 --> 06:07.034
YOUR UNCLE WANTED YOU
TO GET A JOB SO THAT WAY

06:07.034 --> 06:09.169
YOU COULD LEARN TO HAVE
SOME KIND OF WORK ETHIC.

06:09.169 --> 06:12.305
OKAY, FINE, I WILL GET SOMETHING
ELSE DOWN AT THE MALL.

06:12.305 --> 06:13.273
GOD!

06:13.273 --> 06:14.842
NO. I DON'T TRUST YOU.

06:14.842 --> 06:17.445
I NEED YOU TO WORK SOMEPLACE
I CAN KEEP AN EYE ON YOU.

06:17.445 --> 06:19.547
YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:19.547 --> 06:21.715
YOU'RE GONNA WORK
AT THE FACTORY WITH ME.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.551
(gasps)

06:23.551 --> 06:25.719
A FACTORY?

06:27.287 --> 06:28.522
NO WAY.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.424
(gasps)

06:32.259 --> 06:33.861
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE!

06:33.861 --> 06:36.329
YOU'RE GONNA WORK HARD,
YOU'RE GONNA COME HOME TIRED

06:36.329 --> 06:38.165
AND DO IT
OVER AND OVER AGAIN

06:38.165 --> 06:40.367
UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO MAKE AN HONEST LIVING.

06:40.367 --> 06:42.235
AND THEN I GET MY MILLIONS?

06:42.235 --> 06:44.404
WILL YOU
STOP SAYING THAT?!

06:44.404 --> 06:46.006
LOOK, WE ALL KNOW
YOU'RE RICH,

06:46.006 --> 06:48.175
AND THAT ANGIE AND I ARE GONNA
SPEND OUR GOLDEN YEARS

06:48.175 --> 06:51.178
DRIVIN' TO MEXICO
FOR CHEAPER MEDS!

06:51.178 --> 06:52.746
GEORGE!

06:52.746 --> 06:55.048
AND, PLEASE, DON'T JUST SAY
WE'LL HAVE EACH OTHER

06:55.048 --> 06:58.251
BECAUSE I CAN'T LOWER
MY BLOOD PRESSURE WITH THAT!

06:58.251 --> 07:01.188
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

07:04.424 --> 07:07.561
* ALL MY FRIENDS

07:07.561 --> 07:10.664
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

07:21.675 --> 07:24.912
THIS WILL BE YOUR OFFICE.

07:24.912 --> 07:27.047
GROSS.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.982
THIS'LL BE YOUR DESK.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.985
GROSS.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.821
I'LL DO THIS ONE.

07:33.821 --> 07:36.223
(imitates Veronica)
GROSS.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.565
YOU'RE WEARING THAT
ON MONDAY,

07:44.565 --> 07:47.735
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA WEAR
ON CASUAL FRIDAY?

07:49.402 --> 07:52.072
TWO POST-ITS
AND A SUGAR PACKET?

07:54.808 --> 07:57.444
TOMORROW, DRESS
MORE APPROPRIATELY, OKAY?

07:57.444 --> 07:59.680
I DON'T WANT YOU
DISTRACTING THESE GUYS

07:59.680 --> 08:01.381
WORKIN' ON DANGEROUS MACHINES.

08:01.381 --> 08:04.952
ALBERTO'S DOWN TO SEVEN FINGERS.
HE CAN BARELY TIE HIS SHOES.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.657
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S
YOUR FIRST ASSIGNMENT.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.692
PAY ATTENTION,
BECAUSE I HAVE A MEETING

08:11.692 --> 08:13.694
AND I WON'T BE HERE
THIS AFTERNOON.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.696
I NEED YOU TO INPUT
THESE OLD INVOICES,

08:15.696 --> 08:17.497
SO WE CAN FOLLOW
THE PARTS FLOW, OKAY?

08:17.497 --> 08:20.701
IT HAS TO BE DONE BY FRIDAY
SO I CAN DO MY QUARTERLY REPORT.

08:20.701 --> 08:23.203
EW, THIS IS A LOT OF WORK.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.606
THEN YOU BETTER GET STARTED.

08:25.606 --> 08:29.342
YOU GET 2 10-MINUTE BREAKS
AND A HALF-HOUR LUNCH.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.879
OH, THERE'S A TRUCK OUTSIDE,
AND IF YOU ORDER A BURRITO,

08:31.879 --> 08:34.848
MAKE SURE THE GUY MAKES IT,
'CAUSE THE WOMAN HAS T.B.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.592
AHEM.

08:46.026 --> 08:50.263
HEY. I JUST, UH, WANTED TO
WELCOME YOU TO POWERS BROS.

08:50.263 --> 08:53.266
AND, UH, YOU KNOW,

08:53.266 --> 08:55.468
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS,
JUST ASK ME,

08:55.468 --> 08:57.738
'CAUSE I'M A TEAM LEADER.

09:00.507 --> 09:03.744
"TEAM LEADER,"
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

09:03.744 --> 09:06.780
I BET THEY DON'T JUST
GIVE THAT TITLE TO ANYONE.

09:06.780 --> 09:10.183
CHALE, THERE'S ONLY
12 OF US HERE!

09:10.183 --> 09:14.722
I BET YOU COULD DO ANY JOB

09:14.722 --> 09:17.057
IN THE FACTORY
IF YOU WANTED TO, HUH?

09:17.057 --> 09:20.961
YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE
IN A POSITION OF RESPONSIBILITY,

09:20.961 --> 09:23.897
YOU CAN'T JUST GO AROUND
DOIN' PEOPLE'S JOBS.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.633
(inhales deeply)
AY...

09:25.633 --> 09:29.770
YOU HAVE TO, UH, MOTIVATE 'EM
TO DO THE WORK, THEMSELVES.

09:29.770 --> 09:33.941
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO
LOAD INVOICES INTO THE SYSTEM?

09:33.941 --> 09:38.145
MOVE OVER
AND LET ERNIE DRIVE.

09:38.145 --> 09:42.315
(gasps)
OH, YOU ARE SO GOOD!

09:42.315 --> 09:45.118
(giggles)

09:45.118 --> 09:47.688
YEAH...

09:47.688 --> 09:51.759
I GOT MAD SKILLS, YEAH.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.493
NOW, I'M ONLY GONNA DO
A COUPLE OF THESE

09:53.493 --> 09:55.896
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, EVENTUALLY,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LEARN

09:55.896 --> 09:58.999
HOW TO DO THIS WORK
ON YOUR OWN.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.968
OHH.

10:00.968 --> 10:04.738
OHH.

10:04.738 --> 10:07.340
TOUCH MY EARS,
TOUCH MY EARS.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.011
(gasps)

10:11.011 --> 10:13.714
OW!

10:13.714 --> 10:16.950
HEY,
I COULD GET USED TO THAT.

10:18.585 --> 10:20.253
ERNIE, GET BACK TO WORK!

10:20.253 --> 10:21.822
ALL RIGHT.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.123
I'M GONE ONE MINUTE,

10:23.123 --> 10:24.992
YOU GOT SOMEBODY
DOING YOUR WORK FOR YOU?

10:24.992 --> 10:28.361
HE WAS JUST SHOWING ME
HOW TO DO IT. IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

10:28.361 --> 10:29.863
IT'S A HUGE DEAL.

10:29.863 --> 10:32.432
HE THINKS
YOU'RE HIS GIRLFRIEND NOW.

10:32.432 --> 10:35.602
(laughs)
THAT'S CRAZY.

10:35.602 --> 10:37.738
IS IT?

10:42.976 --> 10:45.212
NOW GET BACK TO WORK,

10:45.212 --> 10:48.448
AND I'M GONNA PUT THE WORD OUT
THAT NO ONE IN THIS FACTORY

10:48.448 --> 10:50.050
IS SUPPOSED TO HELP YOU.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.952
THERE'S NO WAY AROUND
GEORGE LOPEZ,

10:51.952 --> 10:54.755
BECAUSE Â¿SABES QUÃ©? THIS IS
MY CASTLE AND I'M THE KING!

10:54.755 --> 10:58.225
I THOUGHT YOUR HOUSE
WAS YOUR CASTLE.

10:58.225 --> 11:02.395
YEAH, WELL, ANGIE SAYS I'M NOT
ALLOWED TO SAY THAT ANYMORE.

11:02.395 --> 11:06.967
HEY, GEORGE, HAVE YOU SEEN
THE LATEST... OOH.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.771
WELL, I GUESS THE TEMP SERVICE
GOT MY MEMO

11:10.771 --> 11:13.306
NOT TO SEND OVER ANY MORE
BOWWOWS.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.008
WHO ARE YOU?

11:15.008 --> 11:17.778
I'M MEL POWERS.
I OWN THIS PLACE.

11:17.778 --> 11:24.551
SO NICE TO MEET YOU.
I'M VERONICA PALMERO.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.119
VERONICA PALMERO.

11:27.587 --> 11:33.026
WELL, I BETTER GET BACK TO BEING
A WEALTHY AND POWERFUL MAN.

11:34.862 --> 11:39.933
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO LOAD INVOICES
INTO THE SYSTEM?

11:39.933 --> 11:43.103
(weakly) OH, I COULD TEACH YOU
TO DO THAT.

11:43.103 --> 11:47.374
(normal voice) I COULD TEACH YOU
A LOT OF THINGS...

11:47.374 --> 11:50.210
MY LITTLE MEXICALI ROSE.

11:53.480 --> 11:57.050
IS IT JUST ME, OR IS IT
MUY CALIENTE IN HERE?

12:01.521 --> 12:06.927
GEORGE, I JUST BOOKED
MY FIRST NEW AGE WEDDING.

12:06.927 --> 12:10.964
OH, IT'S SO ROMANTIC.
THEY'RE NOT GONNA READ VOWS.

12:10.964 --> 12:14.434
THEY'RE GONNA DO
A SOUL-STARING.

12:16.804 --> 12:19.672
WHAT THE HELL
IS A SOUL-STARING?

12:19.672 --> 12:21.674
HERE, HERE. YOU MEET
YOUR PARTNER'S EYES,

12:21.674 --> 12:23.476
BUT YOU DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.412
YOU'RE NOT LOOKING
AT THEIR OUTSIDE,

12:25.412 --> 12:29.950
YOU'RE TRYING TO LOOK PAST THAT
TO THEIR INNER BEING.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.585
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

12:32.585 --> 12:36.689
THE POINT IS TO GET TO
A DEEPER PLACE OF INTIMACY.

12:36.689 --> 12:38.558
(inhales deeply)

12:38.558 --> 12:39.893
AHH.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.235
YOU KNOW, YOU GOT
A "SOUL BOOGER"

12:48.235 --> 12:50.370
RIGHT IN THE CORNER
OF YOUR EYE.

12:53.340 --> 12:54.942
GO LIKE THAT.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.311
I'M SO GLAD WE COULD SHARE.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.647
HOW'D VERONICA
DO AT WORK TODAY?

13:00.647 --> 13:03.851
OH, FIRST OF ALL, SHE TRIED
TO GET ERNIE TO DO HER JOB,

13:03.851 --> 13:06.253
AND THEN WHEN I CAME BACK
FROM MY MEETING,

13:06.253 --> 13:07.988
SHE HAD HARDLY DONE
ANY WORK.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.990
WHAT'D YOU DO?
I LAID DOWN
THE LAW, ANGIE.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.992
I SAID, "YOU STAY THERE
AS LONG AS YOU HAVE TO

13:11.992 --> 13:13.493
"TILL YOU FINISH YOUR WORK.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.762
I DON'T CARE IF YOU GOTTA
TAKE THE BUS HOME!"

13:15.762 --> 13:17.230
ISN'T THAT A BIT HARSH?

13:17.230 --> 13:20.567
ANGIE, WHEN I WAS A KID,
I RODE THE BUS ALL THE TIME.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.270
IT TAUGHT ME ABOUT LIFE.

13:23.270 --> 13:28.175
I SAW AN OLD LADY DIE...
I SAW A BABY BEING BORN...

13:28.175 --> 13:31.011
I SAW A BABY BEING MADE!

13:32.679 --> 13:36.049
I WAS 5 YEARS OLD,
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOIN' ON.

13:36.049 --> 13:39.252
I THOUGHT TWO PEOPLE
WERE FIGHTING OVER A SEAT.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.625
MEL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:45.625 --> 13:47.560
DID SHE SCREW SOMETHING UP?

13:47.560 --> 13:50.597
GEORGE, I CAUGHT HER
STEALING SOMETHING.

13:50.597 --> 13:53.833
MY HEART.

13:59.739 --> 14:02.042
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.611
MEL, SHE'S OUR NIECE.

14:04.611 --> 14:08.315
OH, YEAH, DON'T WORRY.
IT DOESN'T CREEP ME OUT.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.852
SO I WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.487
(laughs)

14:17.925 --> 14:20.093
HE'S REALLY SWEET.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.095
HE LISTENS
TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.464
HE ASKED ME ABOUT
YOUR RAISE,

14:24.464 --> 14:27.500
AND I TOLD HIM I'M KIND OF
ON THE FENCE ABOUT IT.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.002
NIGHTY-NIGHT.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.441
WHICH IS A LONGER
JAIL SENTENCE, ANGIE,

14:34.441 --> 14:37.277
PREMEDITATED MURDER
OR HEAT OF PASSION?

14:39.379 --> 14:41.014
PREMEDITATED.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.882
GOOD, THEN I WON'T THINK
ABOUT IT,

14:42.882 --> 14:44.051
I'LL JUST DO IT.

14:48.621 --> 14:51.358
I CAN'T BELIEVE VERONICA
WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

14:51.358 --> 14:54.361
GET DOWN HERE NOW,
YOU UNGRATEFUL TRAMP!

14:56.263 --> 14:59.232
WHAT?

15:00.700 --> 15:02.502
WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID,

15:02.502 --> 15:04.504
BUT WE WANT TO HEAR IT
FROM YOUR MOUTH.

15:04.504 --> 15:07.540
OKAY, UM,
I BORROWED MOM'S CAR,

15:07.540 --> 15:10.143
BUT I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D NOTICE THE SCRATCH.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.844
YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR THAT.

15:11.844 --> 15:14.514
NOW GO UPSTAIRS.
YOU'RE GROUNDED!

15:14.514 --> 15:18.051
HEY, THAT WAS LUCKY.
WE SHOULD DO THIS ONCE A WEEK.

15:18.051 --> 15:21.554
VERONICA!

15:21.554 --> 15:22.990
YEAH?

15:22.990 --> 15:26.226
HOW COULD YOU PULL
SUCH A SLEAZY STUNT?

15:26.226 --> 15:29.662
WE TOOK YOU INTO OUR HOME,
TREATED YOU LIKE OUR OWN CHILD.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.931
YEAH, WELL, I DIDN'T ASK
TO BECOME YOUR KID,

15:31.931 --> 15:34.501
AND I DIDN'T ASK
TO WORK IN A FACTORY.

15:34.501 --> 15:37.037
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT ALL THIS
IS SUPPOSED TO PROVE.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.039
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE ME
INTO SOMETHING I'M NOT.

15:39.039 --> 15:42.075
LOOK, YOUR MOM'S DYING WISH
WAS THAT YOU GROW UP, VERONICA.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.876
I'M TRYING TO PREPARE YOU
FOR LIFE.

15:43.876 --> 15:45.678
NOT THE LIFE I'M GONNA HAVE.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.947
I'M GONNA BE DEALING
WITH RICH PEOPLE PROBLEMS.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.083
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

15:51.618 --> 15:53.520
I KNOW ABOUT RICH PEOPLE'S
PROBLEMS, OKAY?

15:53.520 --> 15:55.122
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO MAKE A FORTUNE

15:55.122 --> 15:57.624
ONLY TO HAVE YOUR FAMILY
AND FRIENDS SUCK YOU DRY

15:57.624 --> 16:00.627
UNTIL ALL YOUR MILLIONS
ARE GONE!

16:00.627 --> 16:02.662
M.C. HAMMER--
"BEHIND THE MUSIC."

16:02.662 --> 16:04.397
OH.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.566
THIS IS SUCH
A WASTE OF TIME.

16:06.566 --> 16:09.136
I DON'T WANT TO USE MEL
TO GET MY MONEY,

16:09.136 --> 16:11.104
BUT IF I HAVE TO, I WILL.

16:11.104 --> 16:13.040
YOU CAN'T JUST GET
WHAT YOU WANT IN LIFE

16:13.040 --> 16:14.741
BY MANIPULATING MEN.
(footsteps approach)

16:14.741 --> 16:19.279
I FOLDED YOUR WHITES
JUST HOW YOU LIKE THEM.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.948
MAX, SHE'S JUST USING YOU.

16:21.948 --> 16:24.684
HERE'S THE THING
ABOUT THAT, DAD--

16:24.684 --> 16:26.153
I DON'T CARE.

16:26.153 --> 16:28.988
(giggles)

16:32.425 --> 16:34.861
SO... ARE YOU GONNA
WRITE ME A CHECK

16:34.861 --> 16:36.863
FOR MY INHERITANCE OR NOT?

16:36.863 --> 16:38.265
HELL, NO.

16:38.265 --> 16:41.868
ALL RIGHT, I GUESS
I'LL JUST HAVE TO PLAY

16:41.868 --> 16:43.470
THE MEL CARD TOMORROW.

16:43.470 --> 16:46.273
I HOPE HE'S NOT TOO HARD
ON YOU, AND REMEMBER,

16:46.273 --> 16:49.142
YOU MADE ME DO THIS.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.914
THAT'S IT.
THAT WAS THE LAST STRAW.

16:54.914 --> 16:59.352
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.
I WANT HER OUT OF THIS HOUSE.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.553
MOM!

17:01.788 --> 17:04.057
IT WAS JUST A SCRATCH.
I'LL PAY FOR IT.

17:04.057 --> 17:06.526
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

17:08.461 --> 17:10.997
LET IT GO.

17:10.997 --> 17:14.701
I SAY WE GIVE VERONICA HER MONEY
AND SEND HER ON HER WAY.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.637
IF SHE SCREWS UP HER LIFE,
THAT'S HER PROBLEM.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.306
NO, ANGIE.

17:19.306 --> 17:21.474
I'M NOT LETTIN' HER OFF
THAT EASY.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.476
SHE WANTS TO MESS WITH ME,
IT'S ON,

17:23.476 --> 17:24.677
AND I'M GONNA WIN
BECAUSE THE ONLY ONE

17:24.677 --> 17:28.415
WHO CAN OUTSMART
GEORGE LOPEZ IS ME.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.417
I DID IT ONCE,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY,

17:30.417 --> 17:32.685
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
I HAD IT COMING.

17:32.685 --> 17:35.955
SHE HAS MEL
IN THE PALM OF HER HAND.

17:35.955 --> 17:37.257
YOU BETTER WATCH IT.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.658
NO, SHE BETTER WATCH IT.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.960
SHE DOESN'T KNOW THAT I HAVE
THE KILLER INSTINCT.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.496
SHE THINKS SHE'S A SHARK, WELL,
Â¿SABES QUÃ©? I'M A HAMMERHEAD.

17:43.496 --> 17:46.233
I SEE EVERYTHING
WITH MY EYES.

17:46.233 --> 17:49.502
SNEAK UP ON ME?
I DON'T THINK SO.

17:49.502 --> 17:52.239
WHERE AM I?
UNDERNEATH YOU.

17:53.406 --> 17:57.144
I SEE YOU!
DON'T WALK AWAY FROM ME!

17:57.144 --> 17:59.812
OHH, BROWNIE.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.590
(footsteps approach)

18:10.590 --> 18:13.993
UNCLE GEORGE, I KNOW
YOU ASKED ME TO DO THIS FILING,

18:13.993 --> 18:15.795
BUT MEL'S TAKING ME TO LUNCH.

18:15.795 --> 18:20.767
I SUGGESTED YOU DO IT,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? HE AGREED.

18:20.767 --> 18:21.934
(chuckles)

18:21.934 --> 18:23.403
NO PROBLEM.

18:25.172 --> 18:27.374
WHAT? YOU DON'T MIND
DOING MY WORK?

18:27.374 --> 18:29.709
NO. I WON'T BE DOING IT
FOR LONG.

18:29.709 --> 18:32.745
HELLO. YOU READY FOR LUNCH,
KITTEN?

18:32.745 --> 18:37.917
VERONICA, YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T
YOU TAKE THE AFTERNOON OFF?

18:37.917 --> 18:40.119
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

18:40.119 --> 18:42.689
YEAH, TAKE THE WHOLE DAY!

18:42.689 --> 18:45.825
YOU KNOW, MEL, I'M SORRY
FOR THE WAY I REACTED

18:45.825 --> 18:48.060
WHEN I FOUND OUT
YOU WERE DATING MY NIECE.

18:48.060 --> 18:49.862
SO TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU,

18:49.862 --> 18:53.633
I GOT YOU A SUITE
AT THE MONTAGE RESORT.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.503
BEAUTIFUL BEACH,

18:56.503 --> 18:58.738
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KIDS'LL
BE LEAVIN' THE ROOM.

18:58.738 --> 19:03.109
OHH. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS,
GEORGE!

19:03.109 --> 19:04.677
THAT IS SO GREAT!

19:04.677 --> 19:08.047
OH! I GOTTA GET A REFILL
ON MY LITTLE MAGIC PILLS,

19:08.047 --> 19:09.682
AND WE ARE GOOD TO GO.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.426
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:19.426 --> 19:20.927
I'M CALLIN' YOUR BLUFF.

19:20.927 --> 19:23.129
I CAN HANDLE ALL THE WORK
MEL GIVES ME,

19:23.129 --> 19:24.931
BUT YOU CAN ONLY TEASE HIM
FOR SO LONG.

19:24.931 --> 19:28.235
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING, HUH?

19:32.038 --> 19:35.074
VERONICA, WHAT'S THE HOLD UP?
COME ON, LET'S GO.

19:35.074 --> 19:36.843
UH, MEL, CAN WE GO
NEXT WEEK?

19:36.843 --> 19:39.446
I PROMISED A FRIEND
I'D HELP HER MOVE TONIGHT.

19:39.446 --> 19:42.915
I'LL GET SOME GUYS FROM
THE LOADING DOCK TO HELP YOU.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.352
DID I TELL YOU I GOT
THE "SWEETHEART'S PACKAGE"--

19:45.352 --> 19:48.455
FREE CHAMPAGNE
AND HERBAL BODY OILS?

19:48.455 --> 19:52.392
DRUNK AND OILY?
HOT DIGGITY!

19:55.695 --> 19:57.697
MEL, I REALLY DON'T THINK
I SHOULD GO.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.966
I HAVE A TON OF WORK
I GOTTA DO HERE.

19:59.966 --> 20:02.669
SO ARE YOU SAYING
THAT YOU'RE GONNA STAY HERE

20:02.669 --> 20:06.406
AND DO YOUR WORK
LIKE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO?

20:07.940 --> 20:11.444
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, HOLD ON.
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.812
YOU'RE AFRAID I'M GONNA BE

20:12.812 --> 20:15.882
A LITTLE TOO MUCH FOR YOU,
AREN'T YOU?

20:15.882 --> 20:19.218
TELL YOU WHAT, I'LL START OFF
WITH JUST HALF A PILL.

20:22.021 --> 20:23.356
(growls)

20:29.362 --> 20:30.630
OKAY, I'M GOING BACK TO WORK.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.031
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT, MEL,

20:32.031 --> 20:35.101
YOU KNOW, SHE REALLY DOES
HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

20:35.101 --> 20:36.703
NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.538
THAT'S SO NICE OF YOU
TO GET ME THE HOTEL ROOM.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.106
IT'S A SHAME TO WASTE IT.

20:40.106 --> 20:44.043
MIGHT AS WELL CALL ANOTHER
LITTLE LADY FRIEND OF MINE.

20:44.043 --> 20:48.014
JUST GIVE ME THAT HOTEL
CONFIRMATION NUMBER--

20:48.014 --> 20:51.318
HANG ON, JUST LET ME CANCEL
THIS RESERVATION...

20:53.085 --> 20:55.288
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?

21:00.760 --> 21:05.532
SO VERONICA ACTUALLY LASTED
THE WHOLE WEEK?

21:05.532 --> 21:07.099
YEP. SHE EVEN GOT
HER FIRST PAYCHECK.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.835
GOOD FOR HER.

21:08.835 --> 21:11.938
SHE MUCH BE SO EXCITED.
YEAH, COME HERE,
I'LL SHOW YOU.

21:17.009 --> 21:20.246
YOU SEE, THIS IS WHAT
THE FACTORY DOES TO YOU.

21:20.246 --> 21:23.616
YOU START OUT LIKE THAT...

21:23.616 --> 21:27.487
AND YOU END UP LIKE THAT.
