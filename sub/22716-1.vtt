WEBVTT

04:02.050 --> 04:04.610
Come on, let's go.
Let's play some cards here.

04:04.690 --> 04:06.950
Are we gonna play cards,
or we gonna drink?

04:07.020 --> 04:08.460
Three. Damn!

04:08.760 --> 04:10.580
Relax, honey. It's only a quarter.

04:12.160 --> 04:15.560
Let's go, now.
What have we got here, boys and girls?

04:16.329 --> 04:19.829
- Cuatro. Hellfire.
- Lady wins. Pay up, boys.

04:19.899 --> 04:22.130
Okay, let's have another look at 'em.
Roll them around.

04:22.210 --> 04:23.600
What do we got?

04:25.270 --> 04:26.570
Thank you, ma'am.

04:26.780 --> 04:29.470
Oh, no! Five. Dang!

04:29.550 --> 04:31.540
You better try your luck somewhere else.

04:31.810 --> 04:33.270
- Taps me, boys and girls.
- Bye.

05:27.470 --> 05:29.870
- Here I am again.
- Fresh money.

05:30.210 --> 05:32.610
That's a lot better. Come on.

05:32.980 --> 05:34.640
All right, now.

05:34.910 --> 05:37.140
Come on, let's go one more time.

05:37.210 --> 05:39.370
- For old time...
- Official.

05:39.650 --> 05:40.650
Can you beat it?

05:41.170 --> 05:42.100
No, you can't.

05:42.220 --> 05:44.920
- Let's have your money.
- Your luck has changed.

05:44.920 --> 05:44.950
A very pretty lady.
- Let's have your money.
- Your luck has changed.

05:44.950 --> 05:46.030
A very pretty lady.

05:48.120 --> 05:49.560
All right.

05:52.300 --> 05:53.590
Lucky!

05:54.160 --> 05:56.720
You're in early tonight, sweetheart.

05:57.030 --> 05:58.830
My TV is on the bum.

05:58.900 --> 06:02.250
- You owe me for the weekend.
- They were regular customers.

06:02.410 --> 06:05.060
Yeah, but I sent them around
the first time.

06:05.180 --> 06:06.580
I should get a royalty.

06:06.880 --> 06:08.990
You can kiss my royal ass.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.990
Another round over here.

06:16.150 --> 06:20.920
J&B straight-up, Seven and Seven,
and a vodka-tonic, please.

06:21.960 --> 06:25.590
Please hurry.
They're getting crazy over there.

06:29.630 --> 06:31.730
- How are you?
- How am I?

06:32.240 --> 06:34.380
Terrific. $20.

06:34.620 --> 06:37.150
That's what it is all over town.
I thought you'd be a lot more than that.

06:37.610 --> 06:40.130
I should be. You wanna pay for my drink?

06:51.750 --> 06:53.550
I'm the tooth fairy.

06:55.760 --> 06:58.330
Why don't you wait for me outside?

07:09.770 --> 07:11.330
Give me 10 minutes.

07:37.530 --> 07:39.430
Well. My, my.

07:40.240 --> 07:42.780
Perhaps I could interest you
in season tickets?

07:45.940 --> 07:47.910
- Darling.
- What?

07:50.580 --> 07:52.630
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

07:52.850 --> 07:54.390
I don't have no money, though.

07:55.890 --> 07:57.080
Wait a minute, baby.

07:58.120 --> 08:00.320
- I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
- You dirty tramp!

08:01.520 --> 08:03.720
I've got a portable radio. It's worth $25.

08:04.030 --> 08:06.370
- Gets FM and everything.
- I am not a swap shop!

08:06.430 --> 08:08.630
- Don't you do nothing for poor folks?
- Would you get out?

08:08.700 --> 08:10.120
Now, baby...

08:10.160 --> 08:11.700
You're gonna cost me
the whole goddamn night!

08:11.970 --> 08:13.530
I told you I was sorry, now.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.340
Wait a minute. I told you I was sorry.

08:16.710 --> 08:20.370
You know how many times Elmore Pratt
says he's sorry in the course of a year?

08:21.540 --> 08:22.770
None.

08:24.350 --> 08:25.440
Zero.

08:26.480 --> 08:30.450
You can see that it's a very big deal.
I am extremely sorry.

08:30.750 --> 08:32.340
I got no goddamn money.

08:32.919 --> 08:34.090
This your family here?

08:36.909 --> 08:39.150
Yeah, you can tell,
right around the eyes and nose.

08:39.260 --> 08:40.929
That little peckerwood's family.

08:44.700 --> 08:46.630
Do you see much of him?

08:52.740 --> 08:54.720
I sure would like
to meet your family sometime.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.180
- They seem like real good folks...
- Get out of here!

08:59.980 --> 09:02.270
Stupid garbage beggar!

09:09.930 --> 09:12.790
Hey, cowboy.
Can you afford some company?

09:21.770 --> 09:22.860
Hiya, honey.

09:24.570 --> 09:25.630
Hi.

09:34.550 --> 09:37.610
- How you doing tonight, Peg Leg?
- Fine, sweetie.

09:40.790 --> 09:42.450
Say, girlfriend.

09:43.730 --> 09:46.180
Hey, dig, I gotta tell you something.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.710
I had this john... Hi.

10:06.220 --> 10:09.000
- This is a good spot.
- Christ.

10:12.590 --> 10:14.330
I wanna take you out on a date.

10:15.260 --> 10:17.100
No sex involved...

10:18.090 --> 10:19.590
just coffee and a sweet roll.

10:20.030 --> 10:23.370
And I'm gonna get that $20 that I owe you.

10:24.330 --> 10:25.490
Listen close.

10:25.870 --> 10:28.860
You're a beggar, you're stupid,
you smell, you're ugly...

10:28.910 --> 10:32.460
You expect me to believe that I'm ugly?
Hell, I'm not ugly.

10:32.610 --> 10:34.960
- Hey, sugar. Want a date?
- How much?

10:35.340 --> 10:37.150
I want you to meet my family, is why.

10:37.180 --> 10:39.400
I know a guy that will kill you
if I ask him to.

10:39.780 --> 10:40.910
It's $20.

10:42.050 --> 10:43.710
Oh, shit.

10:44.650 --> 10:47.590
Creep, you made my night.
You just got me busted.

10:47.660 --> 10:49.550
- Who's gonna bust you?
- He's gonna bust me.

10:49.630 --> 10:51.580
- You gonna bust her?
- Yeah, I'm gonna bust her.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.420
Shit.

11:06.510 --> 11:08.950
Wait a minute, now. Hang on a second.

11:08.990 --> 11:10.840
Mary, get out of here.

11:10.910 --> 11:12.450
Was that a cop that I hit?

11:13.650 --> 11:16.300
What did you hit him for?
Assaulting a cop.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.690
Do you know how dumb that is?

11:19.160 --> 11:22.760
I'd have been out of there in half an hour.
That's what they have bail for.

11:24.360 --> 11:28.260
I've known some squirrels in my life,
but you are up there at the top of the tree.

11:28.460 --> 11:31.510
I was just trying to help. I didn't know
a whore gets out of jail so easy.

11:31.600 --> 11:34.830
- I ain't no whore.
- Out! Shut the door.

11:36.470 --> 11:38.690
- Say, have you been doing this very long?
- It's been a treat.

11:45.210 --> 11:48.010
- Where do you want me to send that $20?
- Don't push me, bud.

11:49.790 --> 11:51.980
I should have read my horoscope
this morning.

11:52.050 --> 11:53.720
I would have known this was gonna happen.

11:54.060 --> 11:56.620
Must be a Virgo. Must be a goddamn Virgo.

11:57.090 --> 11:59.020
I should have known I was due for a Virgo.

11:59.460 --> 12:01.840
God darn! Ouch!

12:03.630 --> 12:06.190
You're gonna have to quit this streetwalking
before you hurt yourself.

12:08.940 --> 12:10.640
- Where are you going with that?
- My place.

12:18.780 --> 12:19.960
God darn it!

12:22.320 --> 12:24.220
Fine, buy me the best.

12:24.720 --> 12:26.380
He must have gone bankrupt...

12:32.960 --> 12:34.870
- This is a place?
- I don't pay no rent.

12:35.460 --> 12:36.860
It's still too much.

12:36.930 --> 12:39.170
The man who owns this place
don't even know I'm here.

12:40.040 --> 12:42.920
- At least he won't miss it much.
- I ain't going nowhere.

12:43.870 --> 12:45.400
Are you crazy?

12:45.470 --> 12:48.140
Think I'm gonna make
the Ten Most Wanted list off a little scuffle?

12:48.210 --> 12:51.110
Try to understand me.
You cannot hit a cop.

12:51.180 --> 12:54.480
They'll be looking for you.
They'll beat you to death.

12:54.550 --> 12:58.040
- You think he got a good look at me?
- He would know you.

13:01.020 --> 13:02.890
What are you gonna do?

13:05.960 --> 13:07.430
I don't know.

13:07.930 --> 13:11.090
I'll just go across town
for a couple of weeks.

13:13.240 --> 13:14.440
I didn't do nothing.

13:19.780 --> 13:22.340
I guess I cost you plenty, didn't I?

13:24.610 --> 13:26.010
Not really.

13:26.720 --> 13:29.150
It's Monday night. Football.

13:32.960 --> 13:34.660
- You can stay here all you want to.

13:34.700 --> 13:35.580
- Just tonight. Thanks.

13:51.040 --> 13:54.170
- Where the heck do I lay down?
- Right there.

13:56.010 --> 13:58.900
You'll wake up feeling like
a pregnant teenager.

16:27.730 --> 16:30.990
I don't know who you are,
but I think I might.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.030
Rickey...

16:37.210 --> 16:41.110
Rickey's told me about a lady
he sees looking at him sometimes.

16:41.180 --> 16:42.870
You frighten him.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.560
He's afraid of you.

16:49.790 --> 16:51.550
Look, he is our son.

16:52.820 --> 16:56.090
I don't know what you think
you have to do with him...

16:56.160 --> 16:57.680
and I don't want to know.

17:01.030 --> 17:02.290
Now, I'm sorry...

17:02.760 --> 17:05.349
but my husband said if you keep it up,
he's calling the police.

17:08.800 --> 17:11.550
He is a happy little boy...

17:12.420 --> 17:14.010
and we love him very much.

18:32.650 --> 18:34.240
- Hey, John.
- Hey, Elmore.

18:43.100 --> 18:44.370
- Where the hell were you last night?

18:45.030 --> 18:46.900
- I had some trouble, couldn't get here.

18:47.870 --> 18:50.520
Well, you won't have to worry
about that no more.

18:51.170 --> 18:53.390
What did you do, Vernon?
Give me my walking papers?

18:53.980 --> 18:56.380
Car washers ain't hard to replace.

18:56.450 --> 18:58.500
I got me two nights of pay coming here.

18:58.780 --> 19:00.350
Checks come out on Friday.

19:00.350 --> 19:00.370
- I'll be gone by then. I need it now.
- Friday.
Checks come out on Friday.

19:00.370 --> 19:03.480
- I'll be gone by then. I need it now.
- Friday.

19:16.770 --> 19:18.920
- Hey, Dewey.
- Don't talk to me, man.

19:19.800 --> 19:21.120
Your car running?

19:21.140 --> 19:23.170
What the hell do you care?
You ain't using it.

19:23.440 --> 19:25.910
- I need a ride out of here.
- Take a damn bus.

19:26.110 --> 19:28.880
I ain't got the money. I need you
to carry me an hour or two down the road.

19:29.110 --> 19:31.540
Look, man, I'm going home
and get some sleep.

19:32.050 --> 19:34.690
You know who the hell Vernon called
at 3:00 this morning

19:34.880 --> 19:37.390
to come and wash these damn cabs
when you didn't show?

19:37.590 --> 19:38.670
- Pratt.

19:39.030 --> 19:41.020
- Yes?
- Trying to get Dewey fired, too?

19:41.050 --> 19:42.190
No, sir.

19:48.960 --> 19:50.130
No, sir.

19:59.270 --> 20:00.520
Get your gloves on.

20:00.540 --> 20:02.320
- You're ready to go.
- Yes, sir.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.240
- Hey, Arthur.
- I'll see you later. I'll be right with you.

20:04.980 --> 20:07.030
Yeah, so you guys go get ready now.
Put your gloves on.

20:15.790 --> 20:18.330
All of a sudden,
there was a shortage of lockers.

20:18.460 --> 20:20.120
That's my locker, Art.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.860
You ain't paid the rent in over two years.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.510
You don't need it no more, anyway.

20:25.530 --> 20:27.040
Where's my lock?
What did they do, break it?

20:28.300 --> 20:31.370
They just pay me to sit in a chair
and make sure the towels are clean.

20:32.940 --> 20:35.910
- Where's my stuff at?
- It's up there.

21:06.580 --> 21:09.040
Dorm kind of grows on you, don't it?

21:10.710 --> 21:11.880
Are you leaving?

21:13.850 --> 21:16.730
It's been suggested that
it would be the smart thing for me to do.

21:18.190 --> 21:19.040
So am I.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.110
Hell, it's turning into a migration.

21:23.290 --> 21:24.990
How are you going?

21:25.890 --> 21:27.570
Pretty damn close to the road, baby.

21:28.100 --> 21:30.930
Unless, of course, you went out
and bought us a set of plane tickets.

21:32.170 --> 21:34.980
Are you leaving because I got you
in a bunch of trouble or something?

21:37.310 --> 21:39.000
I need a vacation.

21:41.980 --> 21:43.690
- What do you ladies do with all your money?

21:44.030 --> 21:45.680
- Goes into our pension fund.

21:47.380 --> 21:49.160
- Got anyplace special you going back to?
- No.

21:49.840 --> 21:50.850
No

21:52.520 --> 21:55.250
- Which way do you wanna go?
- West, I guess.

21:55.620 --> 21:57.290
- How far?
- I don't care.

21:57.330 --> 21:59.570
- Ever been to California?
- No, it's too far!

22:00.800 --> 22:02.900
Probably about as far
as you can get from Mobile.

22:18.910 --> 22:20.220
The open road.

22:25.950 --> 22:27.550
God damn it!

22:49.910 --> 22:50.990
Here, do you want me to help you?

22:54.420 --> 22:57.050
Let me help you, now. That's right.

23:28.180 --> 23:30.990
I wonder why so many people
go to California in the first place.

23:34.390 --> 23:36.850
I hear the fruits and vegetables
are great out there.

23:40.030 --> 23:42.210
Drugs, avocados...

23:44.700 --> 23:47.610
palm trees, suntans, beach parties...

23:47.940 --> 23:49.740
movie stars and celebrities.

23:53.310 --> 23:54.830
Sunset Strip.

23:56.750 --> 23:58.040
Mexicans.

24:01.420 --> 24:03.050
Any of that stuff sound good to you?

24:03.720 --> 24:05.290
Earthquakes.

24:05.550 --> 24:07.860
Earthquakes. Have a wreck!

24:29.010 --> 24:30.450
Sure is comforting to know...

24:30.610 --> 24:33.430
there's still people in this world
willing to help other people.

24:35.820 --> 24:38.700
What your pot-smokers never had
was family.

24:39.090 --> 24:43.640
Never had them no church, chores,
sports, discipline.

24:44.660 --> 24:46.310
You take us, for example.

24:46.600 --> 24:49.540
We're just an average family
like anybody can have.

24:49.970 --> 24:52.560
All you gotta do is put your shoulder to it...

24:52.870 --> 24:54.560
and make it go.

24:54.570 --> 24:56.180
I'll tell you one thing.

24:56.710 --> 25:00.710
If the police realized that
they've got themselves a responsibility...

25:01.310 --> 25:04.210
to kill a few people every now and then...

25:04.280 --> 25:06.440
I'm not just talking
about your niggers, either...

25:07.680 --> 25:10.550
things would begin to change around here.

25:26.670 --> 25:30.430
One time, I made myself $2,500
in a single fight.

25:32.110 --> 25:33.820
It was over there in Pensacola.

25:36.710 --> 25:38.410
What's the matter?

25:39.780 --> 25:42.200
That little bastard in the brass buttons.

25:43.350 --> 25:47.170
- What did he get?
- Only my wallet. Over $200.

25:51.430 --> 25:53.760
We ain't got the money to pay for it
every time we eat.

25:53.830 --> 25:55.810
- Anything else?
- Just coffee, please.

25:55.960 --> 25:58.880
- You want a cup of coffee?
- I'd like another cup of coffee.

25:59.430 --> 26:01.300
- Two coffees.
- That's gonna change the tax.

26:01.370 --> 26:02.540
Sorry for the trouble.

26:09.380 --> 26:12.600
Elmore, you tell me one single...

26:25.660 --> 26:27.390
Haven't you got any money?

26:29.160 --> 26:32.800
We are gonna be traveling
on wit and grit, gal.

26:32.840 --> 26:35.340
I sure as hell hope and pray
to the good Lord in heaven...

26:35.570 --> 26:37.230
you ain't left yours back in Mobile.

26:53.820 --> 26:57.830
You don't get syphilis
off a goddamn toilet seat!

26:58.890 --> 27:02.480
What do you think I am, anyway?
Some back-ass-ward kid?

27:02.700 --> 27:05.740
Tell me, what other things
have you brought in my house?

27:05.770 --> 27:07.560
Anything I got, I got off of you!

27:07.640 --> 27:10.470
Bullshit! You ain't never got nothing
off of me, bimbo dick!

27:10.840 --> 27:12.720
Nothing I'd recommend, chicken tits!

27:13.140 --> 27:17.480
Is this another damn place we can't come
into thanks to your dirty, fucking mouth?

27:29.220 --> 27:30.420
Amy!

27:33.030 --> 27:34.590
Where are you?

27:36.400 --> 27:38.990
- Come on, Amy.
- Where have you been?

27:46.440 --> 27:47.700
Redneck!

27:48.610 --> 27:50.580
- Elmore!
- What?

27:51.950 --> 27:53.560
- Have you ever been to California?

27:54.670 --> 27:55.770
No!

27:57.050 --> 27:59.740
I hear they have
real good-looking people out there.

28:00.590 --> 28:01.690
Don't believe that.

28:02.250 --> 28:03.820
I met a guy from out there one time...

28:03.850 --> 28:07.660
had the worst case of pimples
of anybody I ever saw in my life.

28:08.230 --> 28:09.440
Well, was he nice?

28:10.120 --> 28:10.440
Yeah !

28:12.200 --> 28:15.390
- Most people that have pimples are nice.
- That's not nice.

28:17.340 --> 28:18.810
- Did you leave any friends back there?

28:19.890 --> 28:20.990
One.

28:22.240 --> 28:25.450
I didn't. I lived there all my life
and I didn't have any friends.

28:27.120 --> 28:29.650
I'd like to meet myself
some real nice people.

28:31.690 --> 28:34.590
You ever meet more than two nice people
in your life, one of them's faking it.

28:36.960 --> 28:39.200
Will that be cash or credit card?

28:45.270 --> 28:46.320
Cash, please.

28:51.570 --> 28:52.770
Go.

28:53.410 --> 28:55.420
That's a $20 bill, damn it!

28:58.680 --> 29:01.590
Wait a minute! That's $20!

29:02.420 --> 29:03.380
Get back here!

29:10.260 --> 29:12.300
Don't forget to count your change!

29:26.370 --> 29:28.930
Look, that's it. We don't need that.

29:29.010 --> 29:31.380
Wait a minute! Get out of there!

29:33.620 --> 29:34.890
Look out!

29:35.120 --> 29:36.720
Get out of the damn road!

29:41.960 --> 29:42.850
Be careful.

29:43.420 --> 29:44.970
Girl, you gonna get killed!

29:50.270 --> 29:53.120
- Where are y'all headed?
- California.

29:54.070 --> 29:55.450
LA, I bet, right?

29:56.070 --> 29:58.270
Every pretty girl I know
either dreams about it

29:58.610 --> 29:59.910
or packs up and moves out there.

30:01.680 --> 30:04.020
I figure they're all out there, waiting on me.

30:08.020 --> 30:10.160
- You going all the way to LA?
- Yeah.

30:11.790 --> 30:15.280
Little stop in San Diego Naval Base
for about 14 months.

30:20.660 --> 30:21.730
You a model?

30:24.470 --> 30:26.690
Anyone could see I'm too short.

30:28.100 --> 30:30.360
You've been sitting since you got in the car.

30:37.610 --> 30:39.070
Let me ask you something.

30:40.380 --> 30:41.610
What's he to you?

30:44.450 --> 30:45.670
He's my cousin.

30:47.660 --> 30:49.820
Lucky for you there's no family resemblance.

30:51.090 --> 30:53.400
- Lucky for me.
- He's ugly.

31:22.690 --> 31:26.320
You can park right across the bridge.
Is that all right?

31:28.500 --> 31:30.640
You can park right across the bridge.

31:31.070 --> 31:33.780
Well, thank you anyway,
but how do I get around town?

31:34.370 --> 31:36.520
Boy, anyone in uniform is a guest here.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.610
You and a date could get in for free.

31:39.340 --> 31:43.340
If you don't accept that hospitality,
we gotta figure you out of your head...

31:43.750 --> 31:45.770
and I'll lock you up for the general good.

31:48.050 --> 31:51.150
- Well, I'm hungry.
- Good.

31:59.590 --> 32:01.810
- Break out the gumbo.
- All right.

32:17.750 --> 32:19.890
Hey, cousin, you in love
or you back in business?

32:25.850 --> 32:28.270
We'll just let him wait in the car
and sleep, baby doll.

32:51.250 --> 32:53.340
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

32:55.680 --> 32:57.950
- You want a cold drink?
- Thank you.

33:00.220 --> 33:00.220
We'll get you filled up yet.

33:01.490 --> 33:03.630
I got ice cream, here! Ice cream!

33:15.700 --> 33:16.790
Ready?

33:21.760 --> 33:24.470
I'll have another one ready for you
in just one sec.

33:24.750 --> 33:25.720
Here you go.

33:52.970 --> 33:54.170
Fill them up, boys.

33:54.710 --> 33:57.570
- I'm loaded.
- Let's go!

34:05.850 --> 34:06.980
Damn!

34:07.720 --> 34:09.150
Give me a little more of that.

34:22.739 --> 34:24.880
- What's happening?
- Look here.

34:26.310 --> 34:28.679
Get him. Hold him down, boy.

34:34.850 --> 34:35.980
Jesus!

34:51.520 --> 34:53.199
My, they're strong.

34:59.940 --> 35:01.870
Come on, let's go over here.

35:16.290 --> 35:17.490
Oh, shootify.

35:17.520 --> 35:19.360
- You wanna try again?
- Yes.

35:23.860 --> 35:25.090
All right.

35:28.300 --> 35:30.780
I think you've won something.
Haven't you won something, now?

35:31.070 --> 35:31.930
I have?

35:33.340 --> 35:34.430
One more.

35:35.580 --> 35:36.600
Sorry.

35:37.080 --> 35:40.020
- You get one for that.
- I wanted the big one.

35:41.750 --> 35:42.940
Winner!

35:43.650 --> 35:44.790
Ice cold beer, here.

35:54.300 --> 35:55.690
All right.

35:57.770 --> 35:59.260
$6, please.

36:02.040 --> 36:03.660
Peanuts! Peanuts, here!

36:04.670 --> 36:06.370
Hot salted peanuts!

36:10.240 --> 36:11.270
Four beers.

36:12.580 --> 36:15.350
I'm Spivey. This here is my hometown.

36:16.780 --> 36:18.710
- This here is Stromberg.
- Hi.

36:18.850 --> 36:21.430
Goose Gosler. And Yankee strangler Bartini.

36:22.260 --> 36:25.150
And as I said before, I'm Spivey.

36:29.630 --> 36:32.650
Goose here's right enough.
You must be a movie star.

36:34.370 --> 36:37.160
I tell you, four good-looking youngsters
like yourselves

36:37.270 --> 36:38.840
you all ought to have dates.

36:39.310 --> 36:41.680
Honey, you ought to try
and keep track of all the beer

36:41.700 --> 36:43.170
these youngsters drink.

36:45.580 --> 36:46.640
It will amaze you.

36:54.620 --> 36:56.100
I know you'd love to dance.

36:58.090 --> 37:00.560
- Ice cold beer.
- Popcorn, Cracker Jacks!

37:03.160 --> 37:05.000
Let me explain the principle of the game.

37:05.070 --> 37:07.170
All you have to do
is watch the Black Queen.

37:25.520 --> 37:26.970
Bartini!

37:27.760 --> 37:29.310
You think we ought to try
to get out of here?

37:58.490 --> 38:00.860
You sure are the best-looking woman
in this town.

38:00.890 --> 38:01.960
Shit!

38:01.960 --> 38:01.980
Spivey, you had better
cut this boy's beer right off.
Shit!

38:01.980 --> 38:04.680
Spivey, you had better
cut this boy's beer right off.

38:04.790 --> 38:07.800
He's right. Even some of the whores
I seen in Germany were better-looking...

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
- than our high-school cheerleaders.
- You know how beat-up them whores are.

38:12.500 --> 38:13.880
- You know, baby?
- Know what?

38:13.970 --> 38:15.900
- You and me ought to get married.
- Ease off.

38:15.900 --> 38:19.010
Me and my daddy,
we got nearly 1,100 acres of sugar beets.

38:19.050 --> 38:20.190
- Is that right?
- Yes.

38:20.230 --> 38:21.870
I reckon I'm just the one for you.

38:29.880 --> 38:31.710
Spivey, what the hell are you doing?

38:32.250 --> 38:35.270
Oh, God, kid, this is funny.
Don't make me laugh.

38:44.870 --> 38:48.890
Oh, crap! This son of a bitch
must be in another navy.

38:48.920 --> 38:50.670
You've got the wrong lady, kid.

38:59.710 --> 39:00.980
Get in here!

39:01.050 --> 39:02.820
- Let's go!
- Let's get the hell out of here.

39:07.420 --> 39:09.350
- What about him?
- To hell with him.

39:09.390 --> 39:11.770
- He's taking us all the way to San Diego.
- Bullshit.

39:12.160 --> 39:13.760
How far are you gonna get in a stolen car?

39:20.900 --> 39:22.840
- Get in here, boy.
- They got my money.

39:22.870 --> 39:25.860
- It's their hometown, son.
- They got my goddamn money!

39:25.910 --> 39:27.360
I can see you wanna go, son.

39:56.870 --> 39:58.960
How come you be carrying
so much cash, boy?

39:59.610 --> 40:00.820
I just won it.

40:02.340 --> 40:05.350
- You a card player?
- No, pinball.

40:07.750 --> 40:11.150
- Pinball?
- Yeah. I'm a wizard.

40:14.260 --> 40:17.120
- You're what?
- The boy is a wizard.

40:18.130 --> 40:20.370
- I thought they wore pointed hats.
- They do.

40:21.460 --> 40:22.600
In the funny papers.

40:33.210 --> 40:34.540
Let me ask you something.

40:35.540 --> 40:37.180
What do you think they'd come up with

40:37.210 --> 40:38.680
if them boys had been digging
in your pockets?

40:47.990 --> 40:51.810
Put me in a room with a pinball machine,
and I'm gonna win money every time.

40:53.060 --> 40:54.100
Every time.

41:24.790 --> 41:26.680
You think he's as good as he says he is?

41:27.700 --> 41:29.250
Nobody ever is.

42:34.800 --> 42:37.820
Where in hell
did Louisiana get a pinball wizard?

42:38.000 --> 42:39.860
Not the same place we got ours.

42:40.230 --> 42:42.970
Hell, I'd have had that machine figured out
if we'd had a little more money.

42:43.970 --> 42:46.130
I was having trouble
with the flipper speed

42:46.240 --> 42:48.510
and the tension on the ball spring
wasn't the same.

42:49.110 --> 42:50.940
You ought to go to playing marbles

42:51.010 --> 42:53.950
'cause you always use
the same thumb in marbles.

42:54.420 --> 42:57.200
You know, being short
is an advantage in pinball, too.

42:57.380 --> 43:00.250
It affects how light reflects off the glass
down here and up here. It's different.

43:01.020 --> 43:03.170
Don't worry about it.
You told us you'd win money.

43:03.320 --> 43:05.680
You turn around and lose it.
That ain't no big deal.

43:08.100 --> 43:11.000
If you did that in my business,
they'd break all the bones in your face.

43:12.700 --> 43:14.030
What business are you in?

43:15.500 --> 43:16.320
I'm a fighter.

43:17.200 --> 43:19.450
- When was your last fight?
- I ain't had it yet.

43:24.410 --> 43:26.760
You two get in the car. Get some sleep.

43:34.490 --> 43:36.830
- Where you going?
- A walk up the street.

43:38.590 --> 43:40.620
Don't worry.
We'll figure something out tomorrow.

43:40.660 --> 43:43.650
I'm not. I'm just gonna get
some of our money back.

43:45.930 --> 43:47.760
You crazy? What are you gonna do,
stick them up?

43:48.640 --> 43:51.880
- What can you do that I can't do?
- Make them smile.

43:52.910 --> 43:54.570
What do you mean?

43:56.840 --> 43:59.450
You're serious?
You'd screw one of them punks?

44:00.750 --> 44:02.440
Honey, we'll get to LA.

44:02.550 --> 44:04.840
I gotta be at the base.
We all got to be somewhere.

44:04.890 --> 44:08.290
Look, sugar, you relax. It ain't no big thing.

44:08.920 --> 44:10.630
This is what I do.

44:18.100 --> 44:19.530
You're a hooker.

44:20.600 --> 44:22.940
That's what you do
when you're too short to be a model?

44:24.270 --> 44:27.840
Jesus Christ! I've been using
all the goddamn charm in the world

44:27.870 --> 44:29.840
ever since you got in the car,
and all it takes is cash.

44:29.910 --> 44:31.460
That's all.

44:31.550 --> 44:33.950
You should wear a sign
telling people what you do.

44:34.150 --> 44:35.690
They wouldn't have tried to rape you.

44:35.750 --> 44:38.070
They'd just have paid you
with the money they robbed off of me.

44:39.190 --> 44:41.920
Well, LA's the right place for you,
that's for damn sure.

44:43.220 --> 44:45.020
Just don't wear it out
between here and there.

44:46.960 --> 44:50.690
You know something? Now that I look
at you, you look like a goddamn whore.

44:52.270 --> 44:54.640
You look like a goddamn fucking whore!

44:56.070 --> 44:57.420
Listen, boy.

44:58.010 --> 45:02.690
A whore is a 16-year-old
with a bad reputation.

45:03.110 --> 45:05.380
I am a hustler.

45:07.780 --> 45:09.820
What the hell is the difference?

45:09.920 --> 45:12.390
Hush, boy,
you done said it all now, have you?

45:14.320 --> 45:16.610
You get out of here
or I'll break your damn neck, son.

45:25.030 --> 45:28.910
You know, actually, a 16-year-old
that's got a bad reputation is

45:31.040 --> 45:32.540
is a slut, see?

45:42.380 --> 45:44.060
I think this is where we get off.

45:54.390 --> 45:57.090
Didn't you and your folks ever camp out
or go fishing?

45:57.360 --> 45:59.190
No, we always lived indoors.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.650
- Did you leave any family back there?
- No. Did you?

46:08.710 --> 46:09.830
My little boy.

46:12.780 --> 46:14.280
How come you'd leave him so fast?

46:15.820 --> 46:18.330
When I had him, I let him be adopted.

46:20.320 --> 46:23.640
Then a couple of years after that,
I started thinking about him.

46:24.830 --> 46:27.850
I wondered what he looked like
and if he was smart or not.

46:28.660 --> 46:31.830
If we'd know each other
if we ever passed each other on the street.

46:32.770 --> 46:35.460
So I went by the hospital where I had him...

46:35.570 --> 46:39.600
and I paid this nurse $300
to tell me who it was that had him.

46:40.910 --> 46:44.370
For years, I've been going by his school
and his house.

46:44.950 --> 46:46.710
I snapped a picture of him once.

46:49.850 --> 46:51.940
Sooner or later,
I'd have done something real dumb...

46:52.990 --> 46:54.160
and messed him up.

46:55.120 --> 46:57.920
The people who have him
told me if I came by any more...

46:57.990 --> 47:00.120
they were gonna call the cops.

47:00.190 --> 47:01.800
Ain't no way you could adopt him back?

47:03.360 --> 47:04.350
No.

47:12.340 --> 47:14.650
- Have you ever been married?
- Yeah.

47:18.050 --> 47:18.910
Tell me.

47:21.480 --> 47:22.620
Her name was Dixie.

47:23.980 --> 47:26.600
Met her on a Tuesday
and I married her on a Wednesday.

47:27.820 --> 47:29.880
The girl didn't want to see me get away.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.950
After a year or so,
she wanted me to quit boxing.

47:39.970 --> 47:41.570
'Cause she was always worried about me.

47:42.870 --> 47:44.160
You'd understand that.

47:47.270 --> 47:48.960
Hell, I wasn't about to quit, so she left.

47:49.080 --> 47:50.790
Lives out in Provo, Utah, now.

47:51.810 --> 47:53.120
I know where Provo is.

47:57.420 --> 47:59.010
Heck, you've given up boxing.

47:59.090 --> 48:02.130
Why don't you just go on over there
and look her up?

48:02.960 --> 48:03.890
I might do that.

48:06.690 --> 48:08.750
Maybe you two could get back together.

48:11.930 --> 48:13.420
Probably not.

48:19.410 --> 48:20.530
See you in the morning.

48:38.890 --> 48:40.650
Elmore, come on, wake up.

48:40.730 --> 48:43.790
- Wake up, there's a train coming.
- So? We ain't sleeping on the tracks.

48:44.100 --> 48:46.300
We gonna get on it.
Come on now, wake up, Elmore!

48:46.730 --> 48:48.000
Get up!

48:48.670 --> 48:51.000
Come on. Here it comes. Elmore!

48:51.100 --> 48:54.040
We ain't gonna get on no damn freight train.

49:01.150 --> 49:03.880
You sure are gonna feel like hell
if I get killed.

49:04.120 --> 49:05.640
That's just what's gonna happen to you, too.

49:05.890 --> 49:07.270
It's your fault, not mine.

49:07.720 --> 49:10.850
You can't do this first thing in the morning
when your muscles are cold...

49:10.920 --> 49:13.940
My muscles ain't cold.
I've been up all night swatting bugs.

49:13.960 --> 49:15.940
You don't even know which way
the damn thing's going.

49:15.960 --> 49:17.420
It's pointed west.

49:19.330 --> 49:21.140
You ever see anybody
jump a freight train before?

49:21.200 --> 49:22.100
No.

49:22.400 --> 49:24.070
- You watch cowboy movies?
- Yes.

49:24.140 --> 49:25.410
- All right, stay there.
- Okay.

49:26.210 --> 49:28.690
- I'm the hero and we've been bushwhacked.
- Okay.

49:28.720 --> 49:32.870
Got but one horse left. I'm gonna ride by
and pick you up. Stay there.

49:48.660 --> 49:50.220
Where the hell you going?

49:58.310 --> 49:59.860
Open your eyes!

50:08.580 --> 50:09.570
Damn it!

50:11.990 --> 50:12.970
Stop the train!

50:15.090 --> 50:18.720
- Babe, I gotta drop you.
- No, wait till the train stops!

50:19.930 --> 50:22.160
- I've got to drop you now.
- No!

50:34.940 --> 50:37.310
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

51:01.600 --> 51:04.080
Say, what's that mean right there?

51:04.270 --> 51:06.160
That means the bus leaves at 10:40.

51:06.640 --> 51:08.670
- What time is it?
- It's 10:50.

51:16.650 --> 51:19.050
It seems like there's one in the morning
for Baton Rouge.

51:19.620 --> 51:22.030
- What's it cost?
- About $20.

51:22.890 --> 51:23.940
None tonight?

51:25.190 --> 51:28.070
Yeah, but I need till the morning
to get a hold of the money.

51:29.310 --> 51:32.500
Where do you plan on sleeping tonight?
Under another tree?

51:33.430 --> 51:34.830
I ain't no Indian.

51:35.770 --> 51:36.820
Read a magazine.

51:50.020 --> 51:51.350
Oh, God.

52:00.990 --> 52:03.410
Hi, you got $20?

52:03.830 --> 52:05.480
- For what?
- A good time.

52:06.400 --> 52:09.440
Shoot, there ain't no whores in this town.

52:10.400 --> 52:12.490
- I'm temporary. You got a place here?
- My truck's got a camper.

52:12.690 --> 52:14.110
My truck's got a camper.

52:14.340 --> 52:15.500
Where is it?

52:18.980 --> 52:21.040
- Where did you come from?
- Heaven.

52:22.910 --> 52:24.920
- That's the guy I want.
- What the hell are you doing?

52:24.950 --> 52:28.020
Shut your damn teeth. You don't wanna
bite your tongue off. There you go.

52:28.090 --> 52:31.110
If you don't quit hitting people,
we won't have a town left to run to.

52:31.430 --> 52:33.910
There is a bus leaving in 30 minutes now.

52:35.600 --> 52:38.670
I don't want to be around you
if you keep on robbing people.

52:38.800 --> 52:40.440
We ain't Bonnie and Clyde.

53:36.490 --> 53:38.650
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

53:39.460 --> 53:41.420
You ever roll a drunk afore?

53:41.490 --> 53:43.640
Yeah, plenty. All the time.

53:43.710 --> 53:46.220
Well, don't do it again
when you're around me.

53:46.670 --> 53:49.410
- It's really lousy.
- Okay.

54:03.720 --> 54:05.470
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'll do your nails.

54:05.650 --> 54:07.760
- Bullshit.
- Give me your hand.

54:09.660 --> 54:12.140
I've never done a man before.
I need the practice.

54:12.180 --> 54:14.240
Lots of men in LA have their nails done.

54:14.490 --> 54:17.790
Yeah? Queers, faggots, and fruitcakes.

54:21.500 --> 54:23.540
Is that what you gonna do
when you get to LA?

54:24.570 --> 54:26.100
Yeah, manicures.

54:26.870 --> 54:30.010
You think I'm traveling 3,000 miles
just to work a new corner?

54:37.550 --> 54:39.380
What are you gonna do?

54:41.690 --> 54:42.930
I'm gonna get by.

54:43.990 --> 54:45.990
It's all I've ever done, it's all I wanna do.

54:47.360 --> 54:49.770
Getting by isn't good enough
for me anymore.

54:50.800 --> 54:53.210
If I can't change this time,
I hope to hell I die.

54:55.370 --> 54:56.870
People don't change.

54:57.970 --> 55:01.040
That little dab of polish right there
ain't gonna make a gentleman out of me...

55:01.270 --> 55:03.390
or a queer, either one. I just am what I am.

55:03.480 --> 55:06.760
I got some news for you, sweetheart.
So are you.

55:08.520 --> 55:11.930
When I was born,
the doctor didn't deliver a baby girl whore.

55:12.720 --> 55:14.300
It's not a birth defect.

55:14.690 --> 55:17.670
If you're able to change from being
what you are, which is a goddam whore,

55:18.060 --> 55:21.030
then why do you have to wait
to get to Los Angeles to do the changing?

55:21.290 --> 55:22.820
I never said it was easy.

55:22.960 --> 55:25.140
You change your life first,
I will change what I do...

55:25.230 --> 55:27.450
and that will change where I go
and who I am with.

55:27.870 --> 55:30.560
I can't change traveling
with a criminal son of a bitch...

55:30.770 --> 55:34.830
who slugs cops, runs out on lunch checks,
and robs drunks.

55:38.610 --> 55:41.300
It'd amaze the hell out of you
how little I've robbed in my life.

01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:28.540
- What'll you have?
- Give me a beer.

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:33.430
- How you feeling, Cory?
- Better.

01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:35.770
Don't go home too early tonight.
Town's loaded.

01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:20.420
- Who makes the fights?
- Jack Tazio.

01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:22.270
- Where's he at?
- He'll be around.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:36.030
- Can you get home okay?
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:40.940
Thank you very much.

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:06.340
You'll love my fights.
I gonna cut up real easy, you know.

01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:09.810
- A lot of blood, mess, everything.
- You forget it.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:13.310
You wouldn't stand for three minutes
on those rubber legs.

01:04:15.930 --> 01:04:19.010
That might be, Jack.
But I'm gonna keep getting back up

01:04:19.050 --> 01:04:21.210
till the whole goddamn joint
is sick to their stomachs.

01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:25.620
All right. You see that kangaroo back there
in the black shirt?

01:04:28.370 --> 01:04:30.290
I didn't get a fight for him this week.

01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:34.280
If he's stupid enough to get in the ring
with a stumblebum like you

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:38.060
- I'll sign the check.
- Thank you, sir. Yes, sir.

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:44.080
And if he says no, you head
for the door and walk.

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:46.060
I'll do that. Thank you.

01:04:57.570 --> 01:04:58.760
How are you boys doing?

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:46.160
Listen, you don't work this street
till you check with me.

01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:49.470
If you're passing through, keep going.

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.200
You don't hang around
and take work from my girls.

01:05:52.890 --> 01:05:54.640
You do, and you'll be sorry.

01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:58.270
You want to work, I'm easy to find.

01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:12.990
You been seeing the sights?

01:07:20.850 --> 01:07:22.720
- Do you have any money?
- A little bit.

01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:28.790
- Could I get something to eat?
- Yeah. Try one of these.

01:07:29.590 --> 01:07:32.650
The old boy might've learned something
making this one.

01:07:32.730 --> 01:07:36.510
Señor, could we have another masterpiece,
please, for the lady?

01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:38.810
And a glass of milk.

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:49.790
Did you have some trouble?

01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:54.100
Or are you just feeling bad?

01:07:57.150 --> 01:08:00.980
The hamburger you are about to eat
will not make you feel any better.

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:06.000
But they will give you a prize if you can get
out the door before you throw up.

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:12.660
- Where did you get the money for that?
- I sold some blood.

01:08:13.470 --> 01:08:15.560
They didn't even ask me where I got it.

01:08:21.210 --> 01:08:22.270
Thank you.

01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:40.359
You gonna say you're sorry?

01:08:44.399 --> 01:08:45.590
Are you traveling with me?

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.490
Would you say you're sorry?

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:55.430
Please?

01:09:01.710 --> 01:09:02.939
I'm sorry.

01:09:05.550 --> 01:09:06.609
It's okay.

01:09:21.670 --> 01:09:23.560
You mean, they don't even ask you
how old you are...

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:27.700
how's your heart, or your brain?
Just go ahead and let you fight?

01:09:28.609 --> 01:09:31.260
Yeah. Well, the old boy had heard of me.

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.220
What'd he hear?

01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:36.060
That I take a licking, and I keep on ticking.

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:40.450
Very funny.

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:49.689
You think we'll see much of each other
out there?

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:53.140
I guess. I don't know nobody in LA.

01:09:53.670 --> 01:09:57.310
I guess the minute you know somebody,
that's gonna be it for old Elmore Pratt.

01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.570
That's not what I said.

01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:03.540
You know, I've been thinking
about getting a job out there.

01:10:05.010 --> 01:10:06.340
Like what?

01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:07.740
I don't know.

01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:11.680
Why don't you turn around
so I don't have to holler at you?

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:15.440
- This is the head of the bed, up here.
- That's right.

01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:25.360
I thought you were just gonna get by.

01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:26.990
That's only if I was alone.

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:36.030
Do you think it's a good idea?

01:10:36.610 --> 01:10:38.840
- I'm listening.
- Well...

01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:42.270
it is.

01:10:59.370 --> 01:11:00.390
What was that?

01:11:01.170 --> 01:11:03.780
Haven't you ever been courted and wooed?

01:11:05.070 --> 01:11:06.170
Courted and wooed?

01:11:08.370 --> 01:11:09.470
Is that what that was?

01:11:14.050 --> 01:11:16.180
I think you left out a whole bunch of stuff.

01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:18.990
Well, there ain't nobody perfect.

01:11:22.090 --> 01:11:23.520
- Elmore.
- What?

01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:26.620
- What kind of fighter were you?
- Lazy. I laid down a lot.

01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:29.320
On purpose?

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.220
- What for?
- Money, honey.

01:11:34.730 --> 01:11:37.460
Is that how you're gonna fight tonight?

01:11:39.970 --> 01:11:41.890
And there's no chance
that you could get hurt?

01:11:42.710 --> 01:11:45.840
No. Ten seconds into the first round...

01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:48.060
my wearying legs will be so far gone,

01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:50.140
it'll give that boy a clear shot at my chin

01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:52.420
and we're gonna be on the road to LA.

01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:53.820
Does he have to hit you in the head?

01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:57.300
He'll probably insist on it.

01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:29.930
Beer.

01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:36.480
Peanuts, here!

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.740
- You're in my seat, mister.
- I don't see no name on it.

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:52.960
Yeah, that's my seat. Get out.

01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:55.840
Mister, get out of my face.
You done lost your seat.

01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:58.720
Yeah, well, I'm getting it back now.

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:34.550
Marvin!

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:45.390
Hi, honey.

01:14:47.730 --> 01:14:50.240
Baby, your daddy's gonna kill that bum.

01:14:58.970 --> 01:15:02.230
No mercy, Marv.
Just get in there and kill him, baby.

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:30.330
May I have your attention, please.

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:35.640
Ten rounds of heavyweight boxing.

01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:41.000
From Mobile, Alabama, at 191 pounds...

01:15:41.710 --> 01:15:44.940
in red trunks, Elmore Pratt.

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:02.460
And our own hometown contender...

01:16:02.970 --> 01:16:05.650
with a string of 10 straight knockouts...

01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:08.770
future champion of the world...

01:16:09.170 --> 01:16:12.010
Marvin "The Fist" Bleitz!

01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:15.020
Marvin Bleitz.

01:16:35.130 --> 01:16:37.310
You both know the rules.
Keep the punches up.

01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:41.270
Break when I tell you to,
use the neutral corners, and keep it clean.

01:16:41.710 --> 01:16:44.390
Go back to your corners.
When the bell rings, come out fighting.

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:48.370
Don't go down too easy, baby boy.
I'll be waiting for you behind the barn.

01:16:48.850 --> 01:16:50.200
When are you gonna pick a winner?

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:06.100
Hi, honey.

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:16.730
- How are your legs?
- I couldn't do two rounds with you.

01:17:17.010 --> 01:17:19.580
I ain't talking about endurance,
I'm talking about foot speed.

01:17:20.710 --> 01:17:23.800
He's always late out of his corner.

01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:19.760
Get your hands up. Get against the wall.

01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:29.950
Got yourself a good provider there, huh?

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.940
When you're working on your own,
you're costing me money.

01:18:33.790 --> 01:18:35.330
It's an easy way to get yourself killed.

01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:37.530
I won that money
in a boxing match, not in a fight.

01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:42.240
What do you mean "fight"?

01:18:42.490 --> 01:18:45.550
Busting up queers and drunks. Pendejo.

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:50.120
Now, let me explain to you
what's going on here.

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:54.400
We got us a protective this end of town.

01:18:55.570 --> 01:18:57.630
We get 20% to protect you from us.

01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:01.250
You miss a payment
or do some bad arithmetic...

01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:04.600
and you'll wind up in a deep hole
on the other side of the border.

01:19:05.250 --> 01:19:06.760
That's just a letter for my kid.

01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:18.790
Really, that's nothing.
It's just a letter for my kid. Honestly...

01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:28.850
She's got a kid somewhere.
She's writing to him.

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:33.960
"I should not be writing this letter,
but maybe I could die.

01:19:35.250 --> 01:19:38.980
"Hope it don't do no harm to know
you got two mamas."

01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:40.730
Shit.

01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:43.280
Who needs this?

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:48.130
She's writing to her kid
and telling him not to forget her.

01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:50.840
She loves him.

01:19:52.030 --> 01:19:53.760
Gringa puta.

01:19:57.740 --> 01:19:59.060
The hell you love him.

01:19:59.610 --> 01:20:01.700
If you did,
you'd never have written this.

01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:10.270
See?

01:20:12.050 --> 01:20:13.330
I love the kid.

01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:24.240
I'm giving his ass a break.

01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:41.330
Because you made a mistake,
tonight you get a special deal.

01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:44.940
I get 100% of the $100.

01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:24.580
Did you have car trouble?

01:21:25.490 --> 01:21:27.640
No, just trouble.

01:21:41.970 --> 01:21:45.640
- Yeah, I heard about that.
- Well, you can't get through there now...

01:21:45.710 --> 01:21:47.060
so you just take a detour...

01:21:47.210 --> 01:21:49.380
- Any of y'all going through to California?
- No.

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:01.390
Is anybody going on to Los Angeles?

01:22:02.190 --> 01:22:04.760
Try the guy over there at the KW.
His name's Gilly.

01:22:04.930 --> 01:22:06.490
- Appreciate it.
- Yeah.

01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:08.950
- You alone?
- No, I got a woman with me.

01:22:09.330 --> 01:22:12.020
- Got a lot of stops between here and there.
- We're not in a hurry.

01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:15.560
- Don't mind the company. Leaving at 7:00.
- We'll be here.

01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:31.220
We are not open yet.

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:33.890
Anything a man can do around here
to get a room for the night?

01:22:34.630 --> 01:22:36.170
- Go see the cook.
- Thank you.

01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:10.640
- I hope you like Mexican food.

01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:12.110
I'm going back to Mobile.

01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:19.470
It'd be a lot easier just to go ahead
and go on to LA.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000
No, it wouldn't.

01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:23.930
You were right.
People don't change.

01:24:26.170 --> 01:24:28.580
This isn't the first time
I've started out for LA.

01:24:29.210 --> 01:24:33.310
I've changed men, cities, my name,
even religions.

01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:35.310
I give up.

01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:38.570
- We're almost there, darling.
- Where? LA?

01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:42.820
I was never going to LA.

01:24:43.490 --> 01:24:45.950
I always wake up
before the dream gets good.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.130
Everybody wakes up.
When I was in the Marines...

01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:51.060
every time I closed my eyes,
I thought I was banging Marilyn Monroe.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:55.030
- To go to LA, you have to have a dream.
- No, all you need is a good job.

01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:58.060
What if you can't get one?
What if there's nothing out there for you?

01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:02.950
If I'm gonna end up broke,
I might as well end up broke in Mobile.

01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:06.820
I used to know this real nice lady there.
She had a beauty shop.

01:25:06.850 --> 01:25:09.410
I'm sure she'd give me a job doing nails
if I asked her.

01:25:09.610 --> 01:25:12.970
You don't want a decent job.
You're just scared to death.

01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:15.230
I don't know nobody in LA.

01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:19.650
You'll go back and stand on your street
corner till your damn plumbing drops out.

01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:21.420
That's what you wanna do.

01:25:21.490 --> 01:25:22.960
That isn't so.

01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:27.880
You wanna wind up in some damn
Gulf coast saloon screwing 40 gay sailors?

01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:32.040
Selling your own blood for pocket change.
You're a goddamn loser, girl!

01:25:35.670 --> 01:25:39.860
Well, listen to the champion of the world.

01:25:40.810 --> 01:25:44.060
How the hell would you know
a winner from a loser?

01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:46.670
At least I've tried. I worked at it.

01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:48.690
I wanted things to be better.

01:25:49.450 --> 01:25:52.750
You wanted to lose.
You fixed it to lose.

01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:54.360
I don't lose.

01:25:55.330 --> 01:25:57.320
They paid you to lay down, didn't they?

01:25:58.030 --> 01:26:02.500
Nobody could pay me to lay down until
I couldn't think of something else to do.

01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:06.750
You are a loser. Losing is your business.

01:26:07.410 --> 01:26:10.040
It's what you do best.

01:26:10.610 --> 01:26:12.420
I've won a lot of fights, baby.

01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:16.070
I've won more than 50% of the contests
I have participated in.

01:26:16.150 --> 01:26:18.980
Any dumbass in the world knows
there's a difference between...

01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:18.990
throwing a fight, winning a fight,
and losing a fight.
Any dumbass in the world knows
there's a difference between...

01:26:18.990 --> 01:26:21.300
throwing a fight, winning a fight,
and losing a fight.

01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:25.620
Really? Well, you ask the dumbass
you were fighting, buddy.

01:26:25.870 --> 01:26:27.010
You lost.

01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:29.430
You ask the dumbass referee. You lost.

01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:31.130
Ask the dumbass peanut vendor

01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:34.610
and any dumbass stupid enough
to ever bet on you.

01:26:34.730 --> 01:26:35.990
You lost!

01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:39.150
You've been on your back more than I have.

01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:41.220
I didn't lose two nights ago.

01:26:42.570 --> 01:26:45.310
I won. Won myself $100.

01:26:47.010 --> 01:26:49.540
And if you could've kept your sorry ass
off the street...

01:26:50.250 --> 01:26:53.230
we'd be on a Greyhound bus now
bound for California...

01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:55.600
- I can't stay in here.
- We'd have money in our pockets,

01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:56.920
Bitch!

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.380
- You going east?
- West.

01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:07.530
- Thanks anyway.
- Wish I was.

01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:22.940
- I'm looking for a ride. Are you going east?
- In about a week.

01:27:27.250 --> 01:27:28.710
Sir, I'm looking for a ride.

01:27:29.150 --> 01:27:31.870
- You got it.
- You don't even know which way I'm going.

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:34.640
If you're as nice as you look,
we'll get there sooner or later.

01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:36.620
All you'll get from me is talk.
I ain't too bright.

01:27:36.890 --> 01:27:39.830
If you're broke, I got a couple of bucks.
Let's discuss it and dance.

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:42.170
You sure have traveled a long way
not to go nowhere.

01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:44.510
- I'm still on the move.
- What about my dance?

01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:46.630
Sit down and relax, she'll get to everybody.

01:27:46.770 --> 01:27:48.560
- If it kills me.
- It probably will.

01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:54.850
There is nothing in the whole wide world
that's any dumber than a whore is.

01:27:54.890 --> 01:27:56.940
Dumbest thing about a whore
is her choice in men.

01:27:57.050 --> 01:27:59.350
You don't choose men.
You ain't with them but five minutes.

01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:01.580
About as long as your fights last.

01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:05.400
Hey, buddy,
take the girl and your noise outside.

01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:07.140
- Yes, sir.
- You let go of me.

01:28:07.330 --> 01:28:09.680
- This man told us to leave.
- I don't care what he said.

01:28:09.710 --> 01:28:11.570
I ain't going nowhere with you.

01:28:14.130 --> 01:28:15.260
Like hell you're not.

01:28:15.850 --> 01:28:18.850
Excuse me. We'll be right back with you,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:22.310
Any of you boys out there now
got a lady that ain't too good in the sack?

01:28:22.770 --> 01:28:26.160
Or else maybe she don't do your fingernails
just the way you want them done?

01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:28.740
Any of you feel that way?

01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:31.860
Here's your chance to get it done
by a real professional.

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:34.600
We got the world's champion
of the world right here.

01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:36.280
What's it gonna cost?

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:40.170
The man says, "What's it gonna cost?"

01:28:41.490 --> 01:28:43.650
Come on, darling, tell us.

01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:48.260
Plenty.

01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:51.160
How about a trip to New Orleans, baby?

01:28:51.300 --> 01:28:52.390
That ain't enough.

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:53.630
$20. Cash.

01:28:53.670 --> 01:28:56.090
What do you think this is,
the Five and Dime?

01:29:02.650 --> 01:29:06.210
You know, there probably ain't no California.

01:29:07.190 --> 01:29:09.180
$30. And my rig's got a sleeper.

01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:15.130
Hey, babe, how about a trip to Seattle?

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:19.640
You all forget it. $30, and that's all I got.
So just shut up.

01:29:21.170 --> 01:29:24.030
You cheapskate! You never threw $35...

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:27.530
It was all a joke.
We were just messing around up here.

01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:29.770
Messing around?

01:29:29.970 --> 01:29:31.940
You haven't messed around
till you've messed around with me.

01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:37.940
- I'm just a big old gentle bear.
- I'm sure you are.

01:29:38.670 --> 01:29:40.190
Elmore!

01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:42.280
Even smell like one, too!

01:29:45.490 --> 01:29:46.760
- Did you call?
- Yes I did.

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:47.890
I didn't.

01:29:57.770 --> 01:29:58.830
You don't learn, do you?

01:30:14.990 --> 01:30:16.410
Hit him, Elmore!

01:30:35.670 --> 01:30:36.860
Got it real good!

01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:40.900
- Y'all still play dance music in here?
- It's been a while.

01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:42.630
Would you care to dance?

01:31:40.770 --> 01:31:41.670
Hey, wait a minute!

01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:06.220
- You're not going to drop me again?
- No, not again.

01:32:25.550 --> 01:32:28.900
- You know, I still owe you $20.
- You're good for it.

01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:36.330
- You think we can make it on our feet?
- Hell, yeah.

01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:39.600
We got four of them now.
