01:47.850 --> 01:51.600
When I look around
this room, I see the future,

01:51.600 --> 01:55.810
defined by strength, resilience,

01:55.810 --> 01:58.230
and the determination
to work together.

01:58.230 --> 02:01.400
So, now, when we stood in the
center of the Pettus Bridge...

02:01.400 --> 02:03.060
and that's Selma, Alabama...

02:03.060 --> 02:06.190
we looked and we saw these
troopers at the other end,

02:06.190 --> 02:08.979
and their rifles in tow,
and we were surprised, you know.

02:08.979 --> 02:11.440
But not one of our
precious souls

02:11.440 --> 02:13.940
expressed an ounce of fear.

02:13.940 --> 02:15.100
Hmm?

02:15.100 --> 02:16.900
If you have anything
worth fighting against,

02:16.900 --> 02:18.400
whether it's injustice

02:18.400 --> 02:19.900
or an out of control
president...

02:23.400 --> 02:26.600
...you stand in the face
of opposition fearlessly.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.600
Now, that's what this
firm represents.

02:28.600 --> 02:31.310
That's what you all are.
You're all fighters.

02:31.310 --> 02:32.640
Each and every one of you.

02:32.640 --> 02:33.940
You're fighters.

02:33.940 --> 02:35.270
I'm done for the day.

02:41.640 --> 02:43.640
Okay, okay.

02:43.640 --> 02:45.400
We still have a firm to operate.

02:45.400 --> 02:46.600
Besides, we don't
want to exhaust

02:46.600 --> 02:48.100
- our founding partner.
- Well,

02:48.100 --> 02:49.270
That's all right, Barbara.
All right, now.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.400
Back to work, y'all.

02:51.770 --> 02:54.440
Did you know he was coming?

02:54.440 --> 02:55.480
No.

02:55.480 --> 02:56.730
You know what he wants?

02:56.730 --> 02:58.310
To see how we're doing.

02:58.310 --> 03:01.730
Complain about how we're doing,
more like.

03:01.730 --> 03:03.230
- Adrian.
- Carl.

03:03.230 --> 03:04.770
- How you doing?
- All right. How you doing?

03:04.770 --> 03:05.810
Good, good.

03:05.810 --> 03:08.690
- Hey, uh, you got a minute?
- Yeah, yeah, go on in.

03:08.690 --> 03:10.060
- In here? Okay.
- Yeah, go on.

03:10.060 --> 03:11.940
Barbara.

03:13.640 --> 03:15.440
Diane.

03:15.440 --> 03:16.480
Are you sure?

03:16.480 --> 03:18.060
I know Carl;
he probably just wants

03:18.060 --> 03:20.060
to talk about the
police brutality cases.

03:20.060 --> 03:21.060
Come on.

03:23.140 --> 03:27.140
Hey, um, maybe just
the name partners?

03:27.140 --> 03:28.140
- You know, maybe...
- Oh, of course.

03:28.140 --> 03:29.560
Well, wait, wait.

03:29.560 --> 03:30.980
Diane's on the executive
committee, Carl.

03:30.980 --> 03:33.730
Probably a good idea
that she be here.

03:38.810 --> 03:41.520
Hey, man, what the hell
is going on here?

03:41.520 --> 03:43.900
I turn my back, and
we're being indicted.

03:43.900 --> 03:45.190
We were not indicted, Carl.

03:45.190 --> 03:47.520
What, you got grand juries
all over your butt, man.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.270
- That's because we're doing our jobs.
- In the meantime, I have to

03:49.270 --> 03:51.140
Find out from the <i>L.A. Times
</i> that you just signed

03:51.140 --> 03:52.900
with one of the whitest
companies in Silicon Valley.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.980
You really complaining
because we brought in a company

03:54.980 --> 03:56.730
worth $86 million a year?

03:56.730 --> 03:58.560
Yeah, two percent
black employment.

03:58.560 --> 04:00.600
We don't have anything
to do with that, Carl.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.310
We have to make a living, Carl.

04:02.310 --> 04:04.230
Now, in the meantime,
I've been receiving these calls

04:04.230 --> 04:05.520
from these clients
who are feeling

04:05.520 --> 04:07.310
- that they're being neglected.
- Who?

04:07.310 --> 04:09.600
- Tell me, who?
- Nigel. He says he can't get you on the phone.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.230
- Nigel Rogers?
- Yeah.

04:11.230 --> 04:12.440
Nigel Rogers has not made money

04:12.440 --> 04:14.440
for this firm since 2009, Carl!

04:14.440 --> 04:17.690
Maybe because you have not
returned his call.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.690
You all right?
Sounds like a fight.

04:19.690 --> 04:21.769
Uh, no,
just a friendly disagreement.

04:21.769 --> 04:23.190
What's up?

04:23.190 --> 04:25.770
I'm just checking to see
if we're still on for tonight?

04:25.770 --> 04:27.020
Yeah. Same place, right?

04:27.021 --> 04:28.270
No, change of plans.

04:28.270 --> 04:30.350
- What?
- Art gallery.

04:30.350 --> 04:32.100
No. Too many people.

04:32.100 --> 04:33.940
Ah, come on. There'll be,
like, eight people there.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.400
No one will see us. I'll go
down on you in the bathroom.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.600
You promised that last time.

04:38.600 --> 04:41.100
Yeah, well, this time,
I double-dog swear.

04:41.100 --> 04:42.770
I'll text the deets.

04:42.770 --> 04:44.940
Don't say "deets."
I hate it when you say "deets."

04:44.940 --> 04:47.270
Deet-deet-deet-deets.

04:47.270 --> 04:48.520
Well, where's your
responsiveness to the community?

04:48.520 --> 04:50.850
I mean, where's your...
Oh, come on, Carl. Seriously?

04:50.850 --> 04:52.440
Carl, wait, we are here,

04:52.440 --> 04:54.900
fighting the good fight.
That's what we're doing.

04:54.900 --> 04:57.440
Um, if you'll excuse me,
I have some calls to make.

04:57.440 --> 04:59.690
- It's so nice meeting you, sir.
- That was not the point of this firm.

04:59.690 --> 05:01.770
- Now, what are we...
- Are you serious, Carl? Come on, come on...

05:01.770 --> 05:03.270
Diane Lockhart.

05:03.271 --> 05:04.770
Pastor Jeremiah, how are you?

05:04.770 --> 05:06.100
It's so good to see you.

05:06.100 --> 05:07.440
You are looking well.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.140
Oh, thank you.
As are you.

05:09.140 --> 05:10.600
You get younger looking.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.270
No, no, it's the times.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.440
It lights a fire in your belly.

05:14.440 --> 05:17.440
That and a stationary
bike. Come on in.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.440
Hey, Carl,

05:19.440 --> 05:21.310
I didn't know Diane
was working here.

05:21.310 --> 05:23.600
She performed amazing miracles

05:23.600 --> 05:25.440
in juvenile court, all pro bono.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.100
Oh, you're too kind.

05:27.100 --> 05:29.190
I imagine Carl has told you
about my issue.

05:29.190 --> 05:30.520
Well, I haven't told them yet.

05:30.520 --> 05:32.690
You know, we were
discussing other business.

05:32.690 --> 05:33.770
Then I'll come back.

05:33.770 --> 05:34.850
Oh, no, no, no, no.

05:34.850 --> 05:35.980
We're gonna go into
the conference room

05:35.980 --> 05:37.100
and let my, uh,

05:37.100 --> 05:39.100
my partners discuss their work.

05:39.100 --> 05:41.270
And, uh, Diane,
will you join us, please?

05:41.270 --> 05:44.520
Mm-hmm.
Uh, certainly.

05:46.270 --> 05:50.980
Mm. He's here for two weeks
and he's gone.

05:50.980 --> 05:52.270
Patience.

05:55.140 --> 05:58.440
It's a transitional house I run,
as part of my outreach ministry.

05:58.440 --> 06:02.100
- Mm. - And Paul has
started to use again.

06:02.100 --> 06:04.850
Uh, that's the young
man I need to evict.

06:04.850 --> 06:08.230
Now, I asked him to leave,
but he refused.

06:08.230 --> 06:10.480
And I have strict policies

06:10.480 --> 06:12.190
against abuse in the house.

06:12.190 --> 06:15.480
Yeah, we don't normally
deliver eviction notices, Rev.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.980
I can handle it, Adrian.
It won't take long.

06:19.980 --> 06:23.520
Well, take DiPersia
and an associate with you,

06:23.520 --> 06:24.900
in case it needs more hours.

06:24.900 --> 06:26.690
I shall. It's good
to see you, Pastor.

06:26.690 --> 06:29.645
- Oh, thank you, Diane.
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.

06:29.646 --> 06:30.600
Mm-hmm.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.940
An eviction? Do we
normally do that?

06:36.940 --> 06:38.350
It's a favor.

06:38.350 --> 06:39.980
Are we expecting trouble?

06:39.980 --> 06:41.810
I don't think so.

06:46.560 --> 06:48.440
Well, actually,
he said that he would.

06:48.440 --> 06:51.560
- Maia?
- Dad.

06:51.560 --> 06:54.520
- Hello, Henry.
- Diane.

06:54.520 --> 06:56.520
Maia, do you have a second?

06:56.520 --> 07:00.850
Uh... No. No, I don't.
I'm working.

07:00.850 --> 07:04.350
It's okay.
Take a minute.

07:07.520 --> 07:10.310
What are you doing here?

07:10.310 --> 07:12.770
Well, you don't answer my calls.

07:12.770 --> 07:15.640
You should take that as a sign
to stop calling, then,

07:15.640 --> 07:17.810
not as a sign
to drop by my work.

07:17.810 --> 07:22.230
Please, Maia.
Ma...

07:25.810 --> 07:29.770
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

07:29.770 --> 07:32.770
I'm sorry
you're going through this.

07:32.770 --> 07:35.060
Thank you.

07:48.100 --> 07:50.900
Drug test.

07:50.900 --> 07:53.060
- Do you carry a gun?
- No.

07:53.060 --> 07:57.400
- You ever need one?
- All the time.

07:58.480 --> 08:01.020
- Paul Johnson?
- Yes?

08:01.021 --> 08:01.940
You're being evicted.

08:08.350 --> 08:12.400
- I'd pick that up.
- Or?

08:12.400 --> 08:14.730
Or I'll ask you
politely to pick it up.

08:19.640 --> 08:22.270
So, this is from Jerry, huh?

08:22.270 --> 08:23.690
What an asshole.

08:23.690 --> 08:25.230
Can't even do his
own dirty work.

08:25.230 --> 08:26.900
We're Pastor Easton's attorney,

08:26.900 --> 08:28.980
- and we need you to know...
- So, this is how you tell someone

08:28.980 --> 08:31.060
You don't want to suck
their cock anymore?

08:31.060 --> 08:32.770
We need you to know, sir,

08:32.770 --> 08:34.640
that you have broken the rules
of this establishment.

08:34.640 --> 08:37.140
Really? The rules that I have to
fuck him whenever he wants?

08:37.140 --> 08:39.559
The only reason he's
trying to kick me out

08:39.559 --> 08:40.900
is because I ended it...
because I don't want

08:40.900 --> 08:42.100
a 70-year-old dick in my mouth.

08:42.100 --> 08:45.480
Shut up and listen.

08:45.480 --> 08:49.600
You have until noon tomorrow
to vacate the premises.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.690
Do you need any help
finding other accommodations?

08:51.690 --> 08:54.850
Tell Jerry he blew it.
I wasn't gonna do anything.

08:54.850 --> 08:56.640
Now I am.

09:01.100 --> 09:03.100
Of course he'd say that.

09:03.100 --> 09:04.940
He says he's going to do
something about it.

09:04.940 --> 09:06.730
What? Contact a lawyer?

09:08.770 --> 09:10.940
- Later, Sharise, please.
- I think you may want to deal with this.

09:10.940 --> 09:13.770
A Gabriel Kovac says
he represents Paul Johnson.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.270
Hello, Mr. Kovac.
How are you?

09:21.270 --> 09:22.400
Okay.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.600
You need more chocolate
and fewer mints.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.770
Okay. Note taken.

09:25.770 --> 09:27.520
Marissa is going to
sit in on this

09:27.520 --> 09:28.770
and take notes,
if you don't mind.

09:28.770 --> 09:29.850
More chocolate. Got it.

09:29.850 --> 09:31.520
Likewise and similarly,

09:31.520 --> 09:35.100
I have an iPhone here
that I'm gonna record,

09:35.100 --> 09:37.690
if I can, uh, put record on.

09:37.690 --> 09:40.045
Some... Um, there.
That button there.

09:40.046 --> 09:42.900
- Oh, great.
- Thank you. Yeah.

09:45.440 --> 09:52.600
So, um... I represent Mr.
Paul Johnson.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.770
He has been fucked over
by your client.

09:54.770 --> 09:56.060
Is that a legal term?

09:56.060 --> 09:57.270
"Fucked over"?

09:57.270 --> 10:00.440
No. But it's accurate.

10:00.440 --> 10:06.020
Pastor Jeremiah placed his penis
in two of my client's orifices.

10:06.020 --> 10:07.600
How's that?

10:07.600 --> 10:10.600
Hmm? Does that satisfy
your Harvard education?

10:10.600 --> 10:12.350
I didn't go to Harvard.

10:12.350 --> 10:13.730
I didn't either.

10:13.730 --> 10:18.400
Uh, you do understand
that by making this accusation,

10:18.400 --> 10:22.230
Mr. Kovac, that you are
inviting a countersuit?

10:22.230 --> 10:25.600
In fact, a baseless accusation
of this kind

10:25.600 --> 10:28.690
would be grounds
to report you to

10:28.690 --> 10:31.440
the Attorney Registration
& Disciplinary Commission.

10:31.440 --> 10:35.020
Ms. Lockhart, here's the thing.

10:35.020 --> 10:36.730
I'm not a great lawyer.

10:36.730 --> 10:38.940
Took me three tries
to pass the bar.

10:38.940 --> 10:41.900
But I do know this.

10:41.900 --> 10:44.230
You were sent in here
to intimidate me,

10:44.230 --> 10:46.440
'cause you're
the token white lawyer,

10:46.440 --> 10:50.440
and use all kinds of words like,
uh, "disciplinary action,"

10:50.440 --> 10:52.440
uh, "court suits,"

10:52.440 --> 10:54.770
um, things like that that
are supposed to scare me off.

10:54.770 --> 10:57.060
I don't think you understand
that this isn't about...

10:57.060 --> 10:58.730
I don't scare easy.

10:58.730 --> 11:00.440
And, uh, I'm not interested

11:00.440 --> 11:03.730
in getting into
the right country club.

11:03.730 --> 11:06.690
All I know is Paul Johnson,

11:06.690 --> 11:10.140
when he was 17 years old,
was raped by your client,

11:10.140 --> 11:12.270
a certified pastor.

11:12.270 --> 11:15.810
And the Illinois
civil statute of limitations

11:15.810 --> 11:18.190
for statutory rape is 20 years.

11:18.190 --> 11:19.640
I looked that up.

11:20.770 --> 11:24.440
I also know that you don't
want this to go to trial.

11:24.440 --> 11:27.100
Pastor Jeremiah is a pastor.

11:27.100 --> 11:30.270
I mean, that's, like, already
two strikes against him.

11:30.270 --> 11:33.100
And the liberals, they're gonna
look at him and think

11:33.100 --> 11:34.640
he rapes kids.

11:34.640 --> 11:36.270
Hey, why don't you have him wear

11:36.270 --> 11:38.600
his collar in court,
and then he'd really be fucked.

11:38.600 --> 11:43.480
- What do you want, Mr. Kovac?
- Money. And a lot of it.

11:43.480 --> 11:46.190
- We won't be blackmailed.
- Yes, you will.

11:46.190 --> 11:47.770
We won't call it that.

11:47.770 --> 11:50.940
We'll call it
a pretrial settlement.

11:50.940 --> 11:53.100
And for our purposes...

11:55.940 --> 11:59.980
I was just joking
about the blackmail thing.

11:59.980 --> 12:02.140
We are merely having
a discussion

12:02.140 --> 12:04.140
about a pretrial settlement.

12:06.270 --> 12:07.980
Nice to meet you.

12:14.270 --> 12:19.850
-Do you ever go on eHarmony?
- No. - Too bad.

12:19.850 --> 12:21.480
You should try it.

12:31.480 --> 12:34.520
- Wow.
- Yep.

12:34.520 --> 12:38.690
We need to arrange a meeting
with the pastor.

13:00.730 --> 13:04.560
You ever fuck a stranger
in an art gallery?

13:04.560 --> 13:07.810
Hmm. It's the only place
I'd fuck a stranger.

13:07.810 --> 13:10.100
I thought you said
there'd be eight people here.

13:10.100 --> 13:12.810
Yeah, there were.
You're a little late.

13:12.810 --> 13:15.640
Okay. Where's the bathroom?

13:17.900 --> 13:20.560
- Wow.
- Yeah.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.600
It's just something
I found in my hamper.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.440
Oh, I want to live
in your hamper.

13:24.440 --> 13:26.940
Quick, no one's looking.
Kiss me.

13:28.770 --> 13:32.940
- Colin?
- Mom?

13:32.940 --> 13:36.140
Yes, Mom.
Here I am, in the flesh.

13:36.140 --> 13:38.310
Well, who's your friend?

13:38.310 --> 13:40.940
She's very sexy.

13:40.940 --> 13:42.940
This is my colleague, Lucca.

13:42.940 --> 13:46.270
Lucca... um... Quinn.

13:46.270 --> 13:47.440
- Quinn. Lucca Quinn.
- Lucca Quinn.

13:47.440 --> 13:49.440
Francesca Lovatelli.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.100
Are you two sleeping
with each other?

13:51.100 --> 13:53.270
- Uh, here we go.
- I'm not in the habit of prying.

13:53.270 --> 13:54.810
It's just that Colin
never tells me anything

13:54.810 --> 13:56.140
about his personal life.

13:56.140 --> 13:57.940
I wonder why.

13:57.940 --> 13:59.600
I thought you said
under the green painting.

13:59.600 --> 14:05.100
- Yes, I did, my son.
- Hey. - Hi, Clarence.

14:05.100 --> 14:08.480
- You two know each other?
- Lucca, right?

14:08.480 --> 14:09.770
You didn't hire me.

14:09.770 --> 14:11.600
Sorry.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.690
Clarence, please,
meet my son, Colin.

14:14.690 --> 14:17.100
- Colin, this is my new attorney.
- Hey, man. How you doing?

14:17.100 --> 14:19.350
Mom, what are you doing? Gallery
hopping with your lawyer?

14:19.350 --> 14:21.480
Hey. Did you see
what Trump is doing?

14:21.480 --> 14:24.690
Oh, my God, this
country. What happened?

14:24.690 --> 14:26.850
I heard they're thinking
of tagging all Muslims.

14:26.850 --> 14:28.350
I know, microchips.

14:28.350 --> 14:30.600
I'm thinking of - becoming Muslim.
- No.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.060
What do you think
about that, Lucca?

14:32.060 --> 14:34.980
Ooh, are you Muslim?
Maybe you are.

14:34.980 --> 14:36.440
Not a Muslim, Mom.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.310
Well, are you gonna come
to the birthday party

14:38.310 --> 14:39.520
tomorrow night?

14:39.520 --> 14:40.940
I, uh... uh, what?

14:40.940 --> 14:42.190
Yeah, tomorrow night.

14:42.190 --> 14:43.940
- Oh.
- Birthday party, tomorrow night.

14:43.940 --> 14:46.100
Huh. I guess someone
forgot to mention it to me.

14:46.100 --> 14:47.810
Colin's 32 years old.

14:47.810 --> 14:51.190
Like Jesus, one year
away from death.

14:51.190 --> 14:54.600
But he still looks like a baby.
Look at that skin.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.980
Uh, I think Lucca's probably
a little busy. I don't...

14:56.980 --> 14:59.230
No, no, no. No, I-I think
I can break that date.

14:59.230 --> 15:00.270
Really?

15:00.271 --> 15:01.310
Thank you, Lucca.

15:01.310 --> 15:03.060
Isn't that just like my son?

15:03.060 --> 15:05.100
Always trying
to push women away.

15:05.100 --> 15:07.270
I know.
Isn't that true?

15:07.270 --> 15:08.770
I hate it.

15:08.770 --> 15:10.230
Did you see what Trump said

15:10.230 --> 15:11.940
about African-Americans?

15:11.940 --> 15:15.020
This lawyer has evidence

15:15.020 --> 15:18.600
of payments you made
to Paul Johnson last year.

15:18.600 --> 15:21.850
Three payments, totaling $9,000.

15:21.850 --> 15:23.100
That's true.

15:25.100 --> 15:26.770
So you made these payments?

15:26.770 --> 15:28.440
Was it money to silence Paul?

15:28.440 --> 15:30.060
No.

15:30.060 --> 15:31.600
Well, then, what was it?

15:31.600 --> 15:34.520
There's scripture,
tells of a traveler,

15:34.520 --> 15:36.270
beaten, robbed,

15:36.270 --> 15:38.020
left at the side of the road.

15:38.020 --> 15:41.850
The only man to offer
help was a Samaritan,

15:41.850 --> 15:43.440
a rival ethnic group.

15:43.440 --> 15:47.400
Now, this Samaritan,
he cared for this man.

15:47.400 --> 15:50.400
That's what I provided.

15:50.400 --> 15:53.940
Care for someone
who needed help.

15:53.940 --> 15:58.770
And I will not let him turn that
into something obscene.

15:58.770 --> 16:02.440
You didn't have a sexual
relationship with him?

16:06.850 --> 16:09.940
No.

16:09.940 --> 16:14.140
All I ever did was
help him get on his feet.

16:17.020 --> 16:19.980
I'm sorry.
I don't believe him, Carl.

16:19.980 --> 16:22.480
And that's how I know
we are not the right firm

16:22.480 --> 16:24.310
for this case.

16:24.310 --> 16:26.520
Well, you only defend people
that you believe?

16:26.520 --> 16:28.690
When the other shoe drops,
and more Pauls come forward,

16:28.690 --> 16:30.270
we're gonna wish
we were nowhere near

16:30.270 --> 16:31.270
involved with this.

16:31.270 --> 16:32.810
We are gonna take this case.

16:32.810 --> 16:36.270
We cannot afford to be
on the wrong side of this.

16:36.270 --> 16:37.520
Now, think about this:

16:37.520 --> 16:40.480
black pastor
rapes 17-year-old child?

16:40.480 --> 16:42.690
Carl.

16:44.480 --> 16:47.980
- I'm invoking Article 4.
- What? Excuse me?

16:47.980 --> 16:49.600
I'm demanding a
full partnership vote

16:49.600 --> 16:51.600
on the leadership of this firm.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.770
We're going
in another direction.

16:53.770 --> 16:55.190
Uh-huh. And you're
the new direction.

16:55.190 --> 16:56.520
Is that it? Seriously?

16:56.520 --> 16:58.770
Yeah, I'm taking my firm back.

16:58.770 --> 17:01.270
You've driven it to the ground,
and in this day and age,

17:01.270 --> 17:02.940
we can't afford to let it drift.

17:04.980 --> 17:08.599
You got old, Carl.

17:08.599 --> 17:10.640
And you're betraying me
right now.

17:10.640 --> 17:13.849
But you know what?
I still honor you.

17:13.849 --> 17:17.099
Everything you've done
in the past.

17:17.099 --> 17:20.770
Truly.
Now you need to go.

17:20.770 --> 17:22.190
You make those
inspirational speeches,

17:22.190 --> 17:23.980
and you take every bit
of that applause,

17:23.980 --> 17:26.190
'cause you have earned it.

17:26.190 --> 17:28.099
But as far as
the future's concerned?

17:28.099 --> 17:30.600
You got to let us
take it from here, Carl.

17:30.600 --> 17:34.600
You know, I've been called old
for about 20 years now.

17:34.600 --> 17:38.900
Every time somebody says that
to me... I smile.

17:38.900 --> 17:41.310
Because they are
underestimating me.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.640
But you know what?

17:43.640 --> 17:46.020
You forgot the lessons
I taught you.

17:46.020 --> 17:48.190
You forgot those lessons.

17:48.190 --> 17:50.230
Now you be careful.

17:50.230 --> 17:51.630
This old man
may just kick your ass.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.770
Yeah, I guess you can understand
what it feels like

18:02.770 --> 18:05.600
to, uh... have a firm
that bears your name

18:05.600 --> 18:07.350
that lost your mission.

18:07.350 --> 18:09.440
- Mm. I've had my experience with that, yes.
- Yeah.

18:09.440 --> 18:11.560
So maybe you can understand
why I'm doing what I'm doing.

18:11.560 --> 18:13.900
Now, there's gonna be
a full vote of the partners.

18:13.900 --> 18:17.190
And I need your help,
so I can get my firm back.

18:17.190 --> 18:21.060
We once stood for something
important, Barbara.

18:21.060 --> 18:23.560
And the only thing we stand
for now is making money,

18:23.560 --> 18:26.900
and as far as I'm concerned,
that means we stand for nothing.

18:26.900 --> 18:31.400
Vote with me, Barbara.
Vote with me, please.

18:31.400 --> 18:33.900
Adrian, he'll have his input,

18:33.900 --> 18:35.940
but he's the head
and you're the heart,

18:35.940 --> 18:37.770
as far as I'm concerned.

18:37.770 --> 18:39.900
Help me put the heart first.

18:43.060 --> 18:45.900
Now, you know, uh,
we're having a vote.

18:45.900 --> 18:49.770
- Managing partner?
- Yes, I heard.

18:49.770 --> 18:51.940
Why don't you check out
the lay of the land for me,

18:51.940 --> 18:54.190
see who's voting for who.

18:54.190 --> 18:56.730
I... Look, I don't want to get
in the middle of this.

18:56.730 --> 18:58.060
Uh, I hope you understand.

18:58.060 --> 18:59.900
Oh, I know, I know, I know.

18:59.900 --> 19:02.520
Why don't you, uh...

19:02.520 --> 19:05.560
put your ear to the ground.

19:05.560 --> 19:07.230
Mr. Reddick asked me to see
what I could find out

19:07.230 --> 19:10.020
about this addict
coming after Pastor Jeremiah.

19:10.020 --> 19:11.270
Go ahead and do it.

19:11.270 --> 19:13.100
But not too many billable hours.

19:13.100 --> 19:14.690
Understood.

19:14.690 --> 19:18.350
He did ask me about
a likely head count

19:18.350 --> 19:20.770
for the vote on
managing partner.

19:20.770 --> 19:23.100
Is that something
you have a problem doing?

19:23.100 --> 19:25.350
Not at all.

19:25.350 --> 19:28.270
I just wanted to see how
accurate you wanted me to be

19:28.270 --> 19:30.020
in what I report back to him.

19:41.060 --> 19:42.980
There but for the grace of God.

19:42.980 --> 19:44.230
Hmm.

19:48.520 --> 19:52.230
Ms. Lockhart, nice to see you.
Welcome.

19:52.230 --> 19:53.940
And... you're not Marissa.

19:53.940 --> 19:55.400
Where is, uh, where is Marissa?

19:55.400 --> 19:56.640
Marissa's my assistant.

19:56.640 --> 19:59.640
- This is Maia.
- Maia. Hello.

19:59.640 --> 20:00.900
Pretty red hair.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.640
I had a dog with red hair.

20:02.640 --> 20:04.350
Uh, please sit down, sit down.

20:04.350 --> 20:06.560
I am just finishing up
a round of Candy Crush.

20:06.560 --> 20:08.100
And this is...

20:08.100 --> 20:10.350
I have to finish this;
if I don't finish,

20:10.350 --> 20:12.730
I'm just gonna be a bit of a...

20:12.730 --> 20:15.230
Hold on a second.
Sorry.

20:15.230 --> 20:19.560
Goddamn it!
Not my day today.

20:19.560 --> 20:21.600
Mr. Kovac,

20:21.600 --> 20:23.560
we've looked into the payments
you told us about,

20:23.560 --> 20:25.480
from Pastor Jeremiah to Paul,

20:25.480 --> 20:28.060
and we're satisfied that there
is an innocent explanation.

20:28.060 --> 20:31.520
We're not gonna offer
Mr. Johnson any money.

20:31.520 --> 20:34.270
- That's final.
- Really?

20:34.270 --> 20:37.480
- And who are you again?
- Maia.

20:37.480 --> 20:38.770
Hmm.

20:38.770 --> 20:41.690
You keep sending out
white lawyers.

20:41.690 --> 20:42.460
Why is that?

20:42.461 --> 20:43.230
Yes, Mr. Kovac,

20:43.230 --> 20:44.980
we're very impressed
with your street smarts.

20:44.980 --> 20:47.020
But at some point,
you have to stop riding

20:47.020 --> 20:48.270
the anti-Ivy League thing.

20:48.270 --> 20:49.940
You either have
the evidence or not.

21:03.940 --> 21:06.100
Okay, you'll have to
explain this.

21:06.100 --> 21:10.640
This is the security footage
from inside the halfway house.

21:10.640 --> 21:13.020
And take a look at
that time stamp.

21:13.020 --> 21:17.810
Pastor Jeremiah goes into
Paul's room at 11:00 at night.

21:17.810 --> 21:22.850
And he comes back out at...
11:30.

21:22.850 --> 21:25.690
That's a half hour.

21:25.690 --> 21:26.980
Hmm?

21:30.020 --> 21:31.230
Mm-hmm.

21:31.230 --> 21:34.230
Yeah, yeah, I may not be polite,

21:34.230 --> 21:36.730
but-but people are
worse than you expect.

21:36.730 --> 21:39.640
Pastors rape little boys!

21:40.900 --> 21:42.640
Even clichés happen.

21:45.640 --> 21:47.730
It was a drug test.

21:47.730 --> 21:51.520
A drug test
that only targeted Paul?

21:51.520 --> 21:54.060
You didn't go into anybody
else's room that night.

21:54.060 --> 21:56.730
Well, there was a report
that Paul, and only Paul,

21:56.730 --> 22:00.190
had a late-night visitor,
perhaps a drug dealer.

22:00.190 --> 22:03.060
So I went into his room
to give him a drug test.

22:03.060 --> 22:05.900
- This was standard procedure?
- Yes.

22:05.900 --> 22:10.100
We have kits on-site
that we use.

22:10.100 --> 22:13.440
I wasn't in his room
for any other reason.

22:15.730 --> 22:17.770
- Can you play it again?
- Sure.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.730
The reverend is the one
who put this security video in.

22:23.730 --> 22:25.810
He wanted to make sure
no one flaunted the rules.

22:25.810 --> 22:27.600
It's insane to think he'd go
into somebody's room

22:27.600 --> 22:28.900
without a reason.

22:28.900 --> 22:30.770
Stop. There.

22:30.770 --> 22:32.230
Go back.

22:32.230 --> 22:33.730
There's a time jump.

22:33.730 --> 22:35.560
You're missing almost
an hour of footage.

22:35.560 --> 22:37.060
No, th-that can't happen.

22:37.060 --> 22:41.230
But look, the time code,
it jumps an hour.

22:44.230 --> 22:45.900
Jeremiah is a good man.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.140
He takes care of us.

22:49.140 --> 22:53.440
He even takes us for
long walks every morning.

22:53.440 --> 22:56.640
It helps us clear our heads,
keeps us in shape.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.140
Why are you saying that?

22:58.140 --> 23:00.140
I'm not saying any different.

23:00.140 --> 23:03.310
A lot of people want
religious people brought down.

23:03.310 --> 23:05.560
They don't like God,
or they don't like people

23:05.560 --> 23:07.600
who believe in God.

23:07.600 --> 23:13.900
- I just want to know the truth.
- Then die.

23:13.900 --> 23:18.190
That's how you know the truth.
Die.

23:18.190 --> 23:19.850
And God'll tell you.

23:22.600 --> 23:24.190
So there's an hour missing.

23:24.190 --> 23:25.165
What does that mean?

23:25.166 --> 23:26.140
I don't know.

23:26.140 --> 23:27.940
Now, either someone is
covering for the reverend,

23:27.940 --> 23:30.310
or Paul Johnson and his lawyer
don't want us to see

23:30.310 --> 23:32.310
- that his dealer entered the room.
- Yeah.

23:33.310 --> 23:34.900
Wait, wait, freeze.

23:34.900 --> 23:36.810
It's a laptop;
just press the space button.

23:40.440 --> 23:42.850
Do you want me to enhance?

23:42.850 --> 23:44.640
What?

23:44.640 --> 23:46.900
I was just thinking
I'm pretty good at your job.

23:46.900 --> 23:49.020
I think I'll go for
a detective license.

23:49.020 --> 23:50.440
Congratulations.

23:50.440 --> 23:51.900
What?

23:51.900 --> 23:54.400
Do you see this?
It's a Fitbit.

23:54.400 --> 23:57.400
When you go on my website,
you can find when I was asleep,

23:57.400 --> 24:00.560
when I was awake, when I was
walking, how far I went.

24:00.560 --> 24:01.940
Look.

24:05.900 --> 24:07.480
Okay.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.850
I'll sponsor you
for a detective's license.

24:09.850 --> 24:11.900
- Really?
- Sure.

24:11.900 --> 24:14.400
Tell me when.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.230
I wasn't able to recover
the deleted security footage,

24:16.230 --> 24:19.060
but Marissa noticed
Paul was wearing

24:19.060 --> 24:20.400
a fitness tracker.

24:20.400 --> 24:22.060
- Hi, I'm Marissa.
- Hi.

24:22.060 --> 24:23.520
Jeremiah gifted everyone
at the halfway house one,

24:23.520 --> 24:25.600
putting an emphasis
on healthy living.

24:25.600 --> 24:27.190
They monitor your heart rate,
count your steps,

24:27.190 --> 24:28.900
things like that. I used
to think they were stupid,

24:28.900 --> 24:30.440
but now I have one. See?

24:30.440 --> 24:32.060
Yeah, the reverend
set up an activity group

24:32.060 --> 24:33.270
for the tenants to compete
with each other.

24:33.270 --> 24:34.900
Which means...

24:34.900 --> 24:36.900
we have access
to all of Paul's data.

24:38.270 --> 24:40.060
This is what Paul was doing?

24:40.060 --> 24:41.400
Oh, well, not everything,
but some.

24:41.400 --> 24:43.060
And it looks like Paul
was sleeping until...

24:43.060 --> 24:45.190
you see that spike there?

24:45.190 --> 24:46.690
That's when Jeremiah knocked
on the door, waking him up.

24:46.690 --> 24:47.900
This still doesn't rule out sex.

24:47.900 --> 24:50.900
Not until you compare
the data side-by-side.

24:50.900 --> 24:53.230
Paul's heart rate
is slowly increasing.

24:53.230 --> 24:54.730
And Jeremiah's is decreasing.

24:54.730 --> 24:56.230
That's not two people
having sex.

24:56.230 --> 24:57.770
Would you excuse me one second?

24:57.770 --> 25:00.350
Now, either Jeremiah somehow

25:00.350 --> 25:01.560
drugged himself
and still managed

25:01.560 --> 25:02.940
to take advantage of Paul, or...

25:02.940 --> 25:05.400
Or Paul is lying.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.560
Amy, what's wrong?

25:07.560 --> 25:09.690
I don't know. Maybe nothing.
I couldn't get ahold of you.

25:09.690 --> 25:11.640
Dad's been trying to call me,
so I've been screening.

25:11.640 --> 25:14.770
Yeah, he called home.
Three times.

25:14.770 --> 25:18.100
Every time I silenced it, he
called back, so I had to answer.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.060
He told me he's always
considered me family

25:20.060 --> 25:22.350
and then thanked me
for being so good to you.

25:22.350 --> 25:23.435
He was sobbing.

25:23.436 --> 25:24.520
What?

25:24.520 --> 25:26.230
It sounded like good-bye.

25:26.230 --> 25:28.810
I think you should call him.

25:30.560 --> 25:31.810
Yeah.

25:39.440 --> 25:41.060
We're not home right now.

25:41.060 --> 25:42.310
Please leave a message af...

26:34.400 --> 26:37.730
Dad?
Hello?

26:37.730 --> 26:40.690
Dad?

26:40.690 --> 26:42.350
I know what
you're thinking, okay?

26:42.350 --> 26:44.310
I'm on my way to you right now.

26:44.310 --> 26:47.230
Just... let's talk.

26:48.810 --> 26:50.980
Dad, I love you, okay?

26:50.980 --> 26:52.230
I'm on my way.

26:52.230 --> 26:53.480
I'm gonna be there soon.

26:53.480 --> 26:56.190
Just... just don't hang up.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.060
Don't hang up, just...

27:02.060 --> 27:04.400
stay with me right n...

27:09.640 --> 27:10.980
Try my mom.

27:45.560 --> 27:47.480
She isn't answering.

27:49.440 --> 27:52.480
- Try her at Uncle Jax's.
- Why?

27:52.480 --> 27:55.400
She might be there.

28:20.020 --> 28:21.020
Ouch.

28:31.350 --> 28:32.560
We really don't have to do this.

28:32.560 --> 28:34.810
Oh, afraid of what I might
learn about you, Mr. Morrello?

28:37.640 --> 28:38.690
Colin!

28:41.100 --> 28:42.440
Mwah!

28:42.440 --> 28:43.810
Happy birthday, son.

28:43.810 --> 28:45.270
Thank you, Dad.
This is Lucca.

28:45.270 --> 28:46.560
I know.

28:46.560 --> 28:49.640
Your mom's been talking about you.
- Ah.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.230
Isn't Trump a nightmare?

28:51.230 --> 28:53.560
Oh. I mean, oh,
my God, what he said

28:53.560 --> 28:56.730
about the Central Park Five.

28:56.730 --> 29:00.270
- Uh, this is Julie, my secretary.
- Hi.

29:01.560 --> 29:03.560
Always hiring the best, Dad.

29:03.560 --> 29:05.690
What's that supposed to mean?

29:05.690 --> 29:07.100
Nothing. Where is Mom?

29:07.100 --> 29:09.020
Near the drinks.
Where do you think?

29:09.020 --> 29:11.060
Hmm.

29:11.060 --> 29:12.850
Very nice to meet you, Lucca.

29:12.850 --> 29:14.900
Uh, you, too,
Mr. Lovatelli.

29:14.900 --> 29:19.230
<i>The Root </i> is a great
online magazine.

29:19.230 --> 29:21.230
I have it on Google Alert.

29:24.850 --> 29:27.480
Please don't judge me
by this evening.

29:27.480 --> 29:29.060
- Too late.
- Hmm.

29:29.060 --> 29:30.690
Lucca, hello.

29:30.690 --> 29:32.190
There you are!

29:32.191 --> 29:33.690
Okay.

29:35.190 --> 29:37.640
You have to settle
a debate for me.

29:37.640 --> 29:39.520
Come on.

29:39.520 --> 29:42.060
Oh, Colin, hi.
Happy birthday.

29:42.060 --> 29:43.190
Thank you, Mom.

29:43.190 --> 29:45.350
Hey, hey, who's that with Dad?

29:45.350 --> 29:46.400
Oh.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.020
That's his newest toy.

29:48.020 --> 29:50.400
I don't complain if it saves him
from having a stroke.

29:50.400 --> 29:52.520
Now, Lucca,

29:52.520 --> 29:55.140
I Googled you, and you are
something special.

29:55.140 --> 29:56.020
Am I?

29:56.021 --> 29:56.900
Yes, you are.

29:56.900 --> 29:59.520
I love your firm.
I really do.

29:59.520 --> 30:01.140
I want you to talk to my son.

30:01.140 --> 30:03.060
He always sided with authority.

30:03.060 --> 30:05.020
I never sided with... Mm-hmm.

30:05.020 --> 30:07.520
Come here.
Here we are, everybody.

30:07.520 --> 30:09.230
Finally, the debate.

30:09.230 --> 30:13.640
Now, African-Americans liked
Bernie Sanders, am I right?

30:13.640 --> 30:15.730
Especially the young ones.

30:15.730 --> 30:17.190
And they would have
out-voted Hillary

30:17.190 --> 30:18.810
if it weren't for
the Southern states.

30:18.810 --> 30:19.850
Do you agree, Lucca?

30:19.850 --> 30:22.640
I don't really have an opinion.

30:22.640 --> 30:24.640
But that is not the question.
The question is the arts.

30:24.640 --> 30:27.190
All else fails without the arts.

30:27.190 --> 30:28.810
Magdalena, please.

30:28.810 --> 30:30.140
Do you know Jay Z?

30:30.140 --> 30:32.690
Would you excuse me
for a second?

30:32.690 --> 30:34.230
Do you need something, Lucca?

30:34.230 --> 30:35.640
No, just a drink.

30:35.640 --> 30:36.900
Let me get it for you.

30:36.900 --> 30:39.480
It's fine.
It's fine.

30:39.480 --> 30:42.810
Oh, she's wonderful.

30:42.810 --> 30:44.020
Wonderful, Colin.

30:44.020 --> 30:46.690
If you don't marry her, I will.

30:46.690 --> 30:47.335
Mom.

30:47.336 --> 30:47.980
Hmm?

30:47.980 --> 30:49.640
Give her a little
room, will you?

30:49.640 --> 30:50.640
Of course.

30:51.690 --> 30:55.520
Dad?!
Dad!

30:55.520 --> 30:57.020
Henry?

30:57.020 --> 30:59.400
Dad?

30:59.400 --> 31:00.560
Henry?

31:00.560 --> 31:02.560
Dad?!

31:09.140 --> 31:10.520
Dad!

31:10.520 --> 31:11.770
Maia?

31:28.060 --> 31:29.480
Oh, my God.

31:29.480 --> 31:31.600
Dad?!

31:31.600 --> 31:32.640
Dad!

31:43.770 --> 31:46.520
What is that?

31:46.520 --> 31:49.810
"Maia, stay here,
call the police.

31:49.810 --> 31:51.060
"Let them handle this.

31:51.060 --> 31:53.520
I don't want you
to see this."

31:53.520 --> 31:55.310
Oh, Jesus Christ.

31:55.310 --> 31:58.020
Dad?

31:58.020 --> 31:59.600
Oh, my God!

32:01.520 --> 32:03.810
Oh, my God, what happened?
What did you do?

32:03.810 --> 32:04.850
- Don't. Please don't call.
- Hello.

32:04.850 --> 32:07.020
I'm at 9511 West Mangolini Road.

32:07.020 --> 32:08.190
We need an ambulance.

32:08.190 --> 32:09.440
Dad, don't ever do that, okay?

32:09.440 --> 32:10.230
Ever!

32:10.231 --> 32:11.020
Maia,

32:11.020 --> 32:13.600
if they think I tried
to commit suicide,

32:13.600 --> 32:14.850
they'll revoke my bail.

32:14.850 --> 32:15.995
You tried to commit suicide?

32:15.996 --> 32:17.140
Shh.

32:17.140 --> 32:18.850
Maia, I need you
to think with me.

32:18.850 --> 32:21.190
If they revoke my bail,
they'll put me behind bars

32:21.190 --> 32:23.520
on suicide watch
until the trial.

32:23.520 --> 32:26.690
Okay, so I just fell.

32:26.690 --> 32:27.415
You fell?

32:27.416 --> 32:28.140
Mm-hmm.

32:28.140 --> 32:29.690
You were checking the roof,
and you fell.

32:29.690 --> 32:30.690
I fell.

32:30.690 --> 32:32.640
Yes. Yeah.

32:32.640 --> 32:34.640
They'll be here
in a few minutes.

32:34.640 --> 32:37.440
Now, Maia, you have
a few minutes.

32:37.440 --> 32:40.440
I need you to make
this look right.

32:56.350 --> 32:59.440
Tell the paramedics
he fell, okay?

33:09.520 --> 33:11.400
Perfect.

33:11.400 --> 33:13.690
Do you think it's all right
that rap lyrics are homophobic,

33:13.690 --> 33:15.350
because it's cultural?

33:15.350 --> 33:16.900
I don't know, Clarence.

33:16.900 --> 33:19.190
Mm. Oh, by the way,
congratulations.

33:19.190 --> 33:20.770
It'll be good for the firm.

33:20.770 --> 33:22.190
What'll be?

33:22.190 --> 33:24.350
Being on his arm as
he runs for office.

33:24.350 --> 33:25.900
It's like de Blasio.

33:25.900 --> 33:28.020
Doesn't just work for
him, it works for you.

33:28.020 --> 33:30.190
Okay, I don't understand
a word you're saying.

33:30.190 --> 33:32.020
They're gonna run
Colin for senator.

33:32.020 --> 33:34.400
That's why he's
working as an AUSA.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.060
It's a stepping stone to office.

33:36.060 --> 33:38.190
So are you.

33:38.190 --> 33:42.190
The hot black girlfriend?
It's a demographic dream.

33:42.190 --> 33:44.850
Ask de Blasio.

33:52.440 --> 33:55.020
Thanks.

33:55.020 --> 33:57.190
Lucca, what's going on?
Where you going?

33:57.190 --> 33:58.770
Uh work. I got to go.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.060
An emergency.

34:00.060 --> 34:01.560
All right, well, I'll take you.

34:01.560 --> 34:04.020
No, it's fine.
I called for a Lyft.

34:04.020 --> 34:05.270
Apologize to
your parents for me.

34:05.270 --> 34:07.020
Work of a lawyer, right?

34:09.560 --> 34:11.230
Colin, come in here!

34:20.020 --> 34:23.139
I-I was thinking...
Triage nurse to E.R.

34:23.139 --> 34:23.889
Oh, my God, Henry.

34:23.891 --> 34:24.639
Oh, my gosh.

34:24.639 --> 34:26.190
What were you doing?

34:26.190 --> 34:27.560
We have people
to check the roof.

34:27.560 --> 34:29.350
Look... Oh, God.
Look at you.

34:29.350 --> 34:31.020
I'm fine. It's nothing, really.
It's-it's...

34:31.020 --> 34:31.710
It's nothing.

34:31.710 --> 34:32.400
It's your leg.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.350
And your back.
I-It's everything.

34:34.350 --> 34:36.600
Oh, my God, if I lost you,

34:36.600 --> 34:38.100
I don't know what I'd do.

34:38.100 --> 34:39.900
Aw.

34:39.900 --> 34:41.270
And what were you doing there?

34:42.900 --> 34:45.100
I wanted... I wanted to see Dad.

34:45.100 --> 34:46.690
Oh, thank God.

34:46.690 --> 34:48.730
If he, if he had
been lying there

34:48.730 --> 34:51.190
all night...

34:59.270 --> 35:02.520
You had Jax bring you here?

35:02.520 --> 35:05.440
I d... I didn't, I didn't
want to wait for a cab.

35:05.440 --> 35:08.520
I was too upset to drive myself.

35:08.520 --> 35:10.980
You have to end it, Mom.

35:10.980 --> 35:13.520
What difference does it make
if Jax drove me here?

35:13.520 --> 35:15.520
Did you hear what I just said?

35:15.520 --> 35:17.350
You have to end it.

35:17.350 --> 35:18.730
End what?

35:18.730 --> 35:20.310
Stop that.

35:20.310 --> 35:22.690
You know what I mean.

35:25.020 --> 35:27.230
Whatever you think you know
about your uncle and I...

35:27.230 --> 35:29.400
It doesn't matter what I think.

35:29.400 --> 35:31.310
It's what my father thinks.

35:31.310 --> 35:34.190
How do you know what he thinks?

35:41.020 --> 35:43.850
What...

35:43.850 --> 35:47.310
"I don't write this
out of feeling wronged,

35:47.310 --> 35:50.690
"that because my wife
slept with my brother,

35:50.690 --> 35:52.520
"I'm owed something.

35:52.520 --> 35:56.520
"It's I who's cheated my wife...

35:56.520 --> 35:58.980
"out of what it feels like

35:58.980 --> 36:02.350
to be loved by someone
you love in return."

36:04.350 --> 36:06.640
What is that?

36:06.640 --> 36:10.770
"Just like I've cheated
my daughter of being able

36:10.770 --> 36:12.850
"to hold her head up

36:12.850 --> 36:16.520
"and not be held accountable
for the mistakes...

36:16.520 --> 36:18.640
"the crimes... of her father.

36:18.640 --> 36:24.100
"I love these two people
more than anyone in the world.

36:24.100 --> 36:26.270
"I just want them to be happy,

36:26.270 --> 36:30.350
"and the best chance
of that happening is for me

36:30.350 --> 36:32.940
to clear out
and let them."

36:35.640 --> 36:39.770
He made me swear I wouldn't
tell you he tried to do it.

36:39.770 --> 36:41.770
You can't say anything.

36:57.810 --> 37:00.230
How's Henry?

37:00.230 --> 37:01.730
Go away.

37:01.730 --> 37:05.560
I just want to check... Go away.

37:07.480 --> 37:09.400
Look, with the
vote six hours away,

37:09.400 --> 37:10.940
here's where we stand.

37:10.940 --> 37:15.190
Evelyn says her expense
allowance is "stingy."

37:15.190 --> 37:16.500
Stingy.

37:16.501 --> 37:17.810
She'd like an increase.

37:17.810 --> 37:19.270
And Mark feels
the firm has lost track

37:19.270 --> 37:20.600
of its civil rights roots.

37:20.600 --> 37:22.310
I love how
Mr. Reddick talks.

37:22.310 --> 37:23.640
Truly.

37:23.640 --> 37:25.480
But we do
more good in the world,

37:25.480 --> 37:27.270
we have the capital to do good.

37:27.270 --> 37:29.520
Trump's America sure ain't
my America. Is it yours?

37:29.520 --> 37:31.480
No, we got to keep on fighting.

37:31.480 --> 37:34.020
So now that we're making more
money, we don't have to be

37:34.020 --> 37:35.850
so stingy
on the expense accounts.

37:35.850 --> 37:38.690
That's the way we felt like
in, uh, Selma, you know?

37:38.690 --> 37:42.350
There's an easier way to live.

37:42.350 --> 37:44.440
Each one of us

37:44.440 --> 37:47.310
is not as strong
as we are collectively.

37:47.310 --> 37:48.980
Right?

37:48.980 --> 37:51.190
Is that fair enough?
That's not rocket science.

37:51.190 --> 37:53.020
Hi.

37:53.020 --> 37:55.020
Yeah, the gentleman behind me...

38:25.440 --> 38:26.850
Sorry.

38:37.940 --> 38:40.270
As you can see, Mr. Kovac,

38:40.270 --> 38:43.100
these are the readouts
from the two fitness trackers...

38:43.100 --> 38:44.520
I hate this thing.

38:44.520 --> 38:46.400
...and the breathing
doesn't match.

38:46.400 --> 38:47.850
Your client's heart rate
is increasing,

38:47.850 --> 38:51.230
and Pastor Jeremiah's
is decreasing.

38:51.230 --> 38:54.020
That is not indicative
of sexual relations.

38:54.020 --> 38:56.520
Oh, my God, you got me.

38:56.520 --> 38:58.770
If I were you,
I would drop this suit, sir,

38:58.770 --> 39:01.350
or you'll be facing
a devastating countersuit.

39:03.350 --> 39:06.230
You know the only problem
you have, Diane?

39:06.230 --> 39:08.690
I can't wait.

39:08.690 --> 39:11.730
Paul can identify
a distinguishing mark

39:11.730 --> 39:13.900
on the good pastor's dick.

39:13.900 --> 39:15.560
Now <i>that</i>

39:15.560 --> 39:18.640
is indicative
of sexual relations.

39:18.640 --> 39:21.600
You still want to countersue
and take this to open court?

39:21.600 --> 39:22.940
Hmm?

39:22.940 --> 39:23.940
You just let me know.

39:30.190 --> 39:32.940
I will not disrobe.

39:32.940 --> 39:36.060
It's the easiest way
to prove him wrong, Rev.

39:36.060 --> 39:38.770
Now you don't have
a birthmark on your penis?

39:38.770 --> 39:40.690
No, I don't.

39:40.690 --> 39:41.565
So he's lying?

39:41.566 --> 39:42.440
Yes.

39:42.440 --> 39:45.190
The difficulty is,
Pastor, if you don't

39:45.190 --> 39:48.100
disrobe, this will
make you look guilty.

39:48.100 --> 39:49.520
I understand that.

39:49.520 --> 39:50.940
I am not disrobing.

39:50.940 --> 39:53.850
You can take the camera

39:53.850 --> 39:56.480
and take a photo of yourself.

39:58.520 --> 40:01.980
I spent my whole life fighting,

40:01.980 --> 40:06.980
fighting for the dignity
that was denied our forebears.

40:06.980 --> 40:08.600
They were treated like this.

40:08.600 --> 40:10.230
I will not be.

40:10.230 --> 40:11.770
That's what he's counting on,

40:11.770 --> 40:14.100
this little, uh... pissant.

40:14.100 --> 40:17.230
He is blackmailing you,
and he's counting on the fact

40:17.230 --> 40:21.020
that you have too much pride
to prove that he's a liar.

40:21.020 --> 40:24.310
Then he's smart, and accurate,

40:24.310 --> 40:25.980
because I won't.

40:25.980 --> 40:28.270
Then I think you should pay him.

40:28.270 --> 40:30.980
He's gonna ruin
your reputation, Reverend.

40:30.980 --> 40:33.350
All that dignity
that you fought for,

40:33.350 --> 40:35.140
it will disappear
just like that.

40:35.140 --> 40:36.310
Do you believe him?

40:36.310 --> 40:37.600
It's not about what I believe,

40:37.600 --> 40:38.900
it's about what we can prove.

40:38.900 --> 40:41.480
That's not what I asked.

40:41.480 --> 40:44.270
Reverend...

40:44.270 --> 40:46.770
I have been around
too long to know better than

40:46.770 --> 40:50.230
to expect anything from my
heroes other than feet of clay.

40:52.810 --> 40:54.940
I don't care
one way or the other.

40:54.940 --> 40:57.730
I just want to beat
this son of a bitch.

40:57.730 --> 41:00.520
The fitness tracker
links to an app

41:00.520 --> 41:01.850
which tracks your routes,
like this.

41:01.850 --> 41:04.520
That's me, running
around the office,

41:04.520 --> 41:06.440
talking to all of the assistants
about who their bosses

41:06.440 --> 41:07.170
are voting for.

41:07.171 --> 41:07.900
And?

41:07.900 --> 41:09.770
I was able to pull up
Paul Johnson's tracking data

41:09.770 --> 41:10.770
for the past two months.

41:14.400 --> 41:17.400
When Paul goes jogging,
it's fairly random.

41:17.400 --> 41:19.400
No two routes
appear to be the same.

41:19.400 --> 41:22.060
But about two weeks ago,
a pattern started to emerge.

41:22.060 --> 41:24.100
Two or three times a week,
Paul's routes included

41:24.100 --> 41:25.560
a pit stop at Kovac's office.

41:25.560 --> 41:27.400
Well, that makes sense;
he's his lawyer.

41:27.400 --> 41:29.400
No. Paul didn't
claim to have a lawyer

41:29.400 --> 41:31.850
until we served him
the eviction notice.

41:31.850 --> 41:33.730
Good.

41:33.730 --> 41:35.770
We need to look
deeper into Kovac.

41:35.770 --> 41:38.060
Any lawsuits, past crimes.

41:38.060 --> 41:40.060
See what you can find.

41:40.060 --> 41:41.310
Perfect timing.

41:41.311 --> 41:42.560
Yeah.

41:42.560 --> 41:43.560
Uh, Ms. Stanway?

41:43.560 --> 41:44.900
Yes?

41:44.900 --> 41:46.400
Hi. We're from the law firm
Reddick/Boseman.

41:46.400 --> 41:47.770
We were wondering
if we can ask you

41:47.770 --> 41:49.770
a few questions
about Gabe Kovac.

41:49.770 --> 41:51.400
Records show you sued him for
an assault a few years back.

41:51.400 --> 41:52.850
Yeah, we settled and I
dropped the charges.

41:52.850 --> 41:54.400
Can you tell us what happened?

41:54.400 --> 41:56.190
I'm sorry. I signed a
nondisclosure agreement.

41:56.190 --> 41:57.850
What if we promise not to tell?

41:57.850 --> 41:59.520
Hey, you never know.

41:59.520 --> 42:01.400
- Sorry. If you'll excuse me.
- Uh, Why would Kovac

42:01.400 --> 42:03.350
- Have you sign an NDA?
- He didn't. His lawyer did.

42:03.350 --> 42:04.900
And it wasn't with him.

42:04.900 --> 42:07.730
It was with his employer,
First Charter Choice.

42:07.730 --> 42:09.400
- First Charter Choice.
- What's that?

42:09.400 --> 42:11.190
It's an alt-right cause.

42:11.190 --> 42:13.100
Okay, am I missing something?

42:13.100 --> 42:15.020
No, but I was.

42:15.020 --> 42:15.730
Who you calling?

42:15.731 --> 42:16.440
Adrian.

42:16.440 --> 42:18.440
They're going
into negotiations. Come on.

42:19.900 --> 42:21.690
Got it, Jay.

42:21.690 --> 42:22.560
Thanks.

42:22.560 --> 42:23.560
Good work.

42:23.560 --> 42:24.640
Anytime.

42:25.850 --> 42:27.480
Oh. Uh, come on in, gentlemen.

42:29.770 --> 42:33.600
So, I guess you
finally came to your senses,

42:33.600 --> 42:34.900
and are ready to settle.

42:34.900 --> 42:36.190
Are you at all familiar

42:36.190 --> 42:37.980
with Rule 1.7 of the ARDC

42:37.980 --> 42:39.770
Code of Ethics,
Mr. Kovac?

42:39.770 --> 42:42.600
It's been a while since
I studied for the bar.

42:42.600 --> 42:45.560
Why don't, uh... why don't
you sum it up for me.

42:45.560 --> 42:48.810
Conflicts of interest between
attorneys and their clients

42:48.810 --> 42:50.690
may result in disbarment.

42:50.690 --> 42:54.730
Do I have a kind of conflict
of interest with Paul?

42:54.730 --> 42:56.900
We're aware that you have
done business with, uh,

42:56.900 --> 42:58.850
Mr. Selkirk's
right-wing legal foundation,

42:58.850 --> 43:00.230
First Charter Choice.

43:00.230 --> 43:01.520
And we're also aware

43:01.520 --> 43:03.940
that Selkirk subsidized
this "lawsuit,"

43:03.940 --> 43:05.480
to embarrass the good reverend.

43:05.480 --> 43:07.350
You're taking money
from the alt-right, Mr. Kovac,

43:07.350 --> 43:09.350
and you edited
the drug dealer from that video.

43:09.350 --> 43:10.640
You know what?

43:10.640 --> 43:14.900
I think we're, uh...
we're about done here.

43:14.900 --> 43:18.350
And we are prepared to file
a civil suit against you

43:18.350 --> 43:21.140
and your client...
for extortion!

43:21.140 --> 43:22.640
Have a good day, now!

43:37.020 --> 43:39.020
Why aren't you
answering my calls?

43:39.020 --> 43:40.230
I've been busy.

43:40.230 --> 43:42.060
My family is insane.

43:42.060 --> 43:44.520
Why do you think I didn't
introduce you to them earlier?

43:44.520 --> 43:46.560
This isn't about your family.

43:46.560 --> 43:49.020
It's about this relationship.
It's run its course.

43:49.020 --> 43:50.640
I disagree.

43:50.640 --> 43:52.560
That's your right.

43:52.560 --> 43:55.900
I'm not sure what you're
looking for, but I'm not her.

43:55.900 --> 43:58.810
I'm not an accessory,
I'm not a... trophy.

43:58.810 --> 44:00.900
I'm sure as hell not a wife.

44:00.900 --> 44:03.190
And I never treated
you that way.

44:03.190 --> 44:05.810
And if anyone ever does,
they have no place in my life.

44:05.810 --> 44:08.850
You're making this a bigger deal
than it needs to be.

44:10.730 --> 44:12.060
I don't like your tone.

44:12.060 --> 44:13.480
There is no tone.

44:13.480 --> 44:15.730
We had fun.

44:15.730 --> 44:18.230
Both knew it wasn't for life.

44:18.230 --> 44:20.140
We don't do "for life."

44:22.100 --> 44:23.560
I have to go.

44:52.730 --> 44:54.900
Imani's voting for Reddick,
but you have

44:54.900 --> 44:57.140
Calvin Story,
Eunice and Tommy Neville.

44:57.140 --> 44:59.770
By my count, you're up one.

44:59.770 --> 45:00.770
Good. Thank you.

45:00.770 --> 45:01.770
Julius.

45:01.770 --> 45:03.230
Saved you a seat.

45:03.230 --> 45:03.835
Fucking Julius?

45:03.836 --> 45:04.440
Thanks, Carl.

45:04.440 --> 45:06.230
Yeah.

45:06.230 --> 45:08.440
Carl.

45:08.440 --> 45:12.060
Julius Cain is leaving the firm.
He is ineligible to vote.

45:12.060 --> 45:14.270
Article 12,
Subsection D puts forth

45:14.270 --> 45:16.020
that full voting rights
will remain in force

45:16.020 --> 45:18.980
through the last day
of the partner's pay period,

45:18.980 --> 45:21.230
which I believe is Thursday.

45:21.230 --> 45:22.640
Well, then
shall we commence, uh,

45:22.640 --> 45:24.100
casting the ballots?

45:33.560 --> 45:37.480
11 for Adrian and 12 for Carl.

45:37.480 --> 45:39.980
I want the room polled.

45:39.980 --> 45:42.690
For what reason? You lost.

45:42.690 --> 45:45.560
I want to vote for the removal
of Adrian Boseman.

45:45.560 --> 45:46.940
Wait.

45:46.940 --> 45:49.060
I didn't vote.

45:49.060 --> 45:50.480
But I want to now.

45:50.480 --> 45:51.520
Eh, it's too late.

45:51.520 --> 45:53.190
No, it's not.

45:53.190 --> 45:57.060
Carl, you said this was a battle

45:57.060 --> 45:59.600
between the firm's heart
and its head.

45:59.600 --> 46:01.400
But it's not.

46:01.400 --> 46:03.940
It's about the past
or the future.

46:06.400 --> 46:09.100
Your past glories
have a lot to teach us,

46:09.100 --> 46:13.060
but this... this is now.

46:13.060 --> 46:16.440
The fights are now, and Adrian
knows how to fight them.

46:19.270 --> 46:21.770
I vote for Adrian.

46:25.560 --> 46:27.730
So here we are.

46:27.730 --> 46:29.350
We're split.

46:29.350 --> 46:30.560
Yep.

46:30.560 --> 46:32.520
50/50.

46:32.520 --> 46:34.900
This should be fun.

46:34.900 --> 46:37.690
Hmm. That's the problem
with the world today, huh?

46:37.690 --> 46:39.270
You think the fights
are different now.
