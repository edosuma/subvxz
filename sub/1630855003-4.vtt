WEBVTT

00:00.101 --> 00:02.436
Previously on Yellowjackets...

00:02.728 --> 00:04.021
We're flying.

00:04.605 --> 00:06.524
We won't be hungry much longer.

00:09.401 --> 00:11.612
We should gather its blessings.

00:15.825 --> 00:16.826
Wow, these
are getting pretty good.

00:17.284 --> 00:17.868
So, that's...

00:18.410 --> 00:19.411
seven miles in each direction?

00:19.787 --> 00:20.204
Your brother's alive.

00:20.746 --> 00:21.747
I know you think that he's dead.

00:22.289 --> 00:24.500
It's been two months.

00:24.834 --> 00:26.127
Hanging on a branch.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.420
How did you know about this?

00:28.629 --> 00:29.505
Answer me.

00:29.797 --> 00:30.714
I don't know.

00:31.340 --> 00:32.800
- How hard are you pushing?
- Some of you guys just

00:33.300 --> 00:34.301
love living off the grid.

00:35.344 --> 00:36.137
Bitch.

00:36.679 --> 00:37.513
It is an honor to meet you,
Misty Quigley.

00:37.972 --> 00:39.140
You too, Walter Tattersall.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.267
I'm Callie.

00:41.475 --> 00:42.143
Jay.

00:42.643 --> 00:43.894
Shauna was having an affair.

00:44.311 --> 00:44.854
You got bad intel.

00:46.480 --> 00:47.148
Go into that anger.

00:47.606 --> 00:48.649
Things are tense

00:49.150 --> 00:49.984
with Simone's family right now.

00:50.526 --> 00:52.153
Remember what I told you
about my problem?

00:52.611 --> 00:54.321
It's getting worse.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.083
Taissa...

01:08.294 --> 01:09.879
Taissa...

01:12.214 --> 01:14.800
Taissa...

01:15.176 --> 01:16.135
Taissa.

01:16.552 --> 01:18.470
Come back. I'm right here.

01:20.514 --> 01:21.891
I'm right here.

01:22.391 --> 01:25.853
You found another one. Look.

01:26.187 --> 01:28.314
Look.

01:29.523 --> 01:32.318
Something in you knows
that these trees are here.

01:32.902 --> 01:35.779
I don't know
anything about this.

01:36.363 --> 01:38.199
- Oh, let me sleep.
- I know, I know, but Tai,

01:38.657 --> 01:39.533
listen, listen to me.

01:40.034 --> 01:42.244
If we just talked to Lottie,

01:42.745 --> 01:43.662
- No.
- she-she could tap into

01:44.246 --> 01:44.997
- No. No way.
- the part of you that--

01:45.414 --> 01:47.291
No, I told you no!

01:47.750 --> 01:50.753
It's none of her
fucking business.

01:54.381 --> 01:56.383
I'm going back to bed.

01:58.761 --> 02:00.304
eerie, ethereal music

02:15.277 --> 02:17.571
ominous music

02:29.708 --> 02:30.459
Busy.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.044
Yeah, busy cashing my checks.

02:32.628 --> 02:33.504
Some of you guys just love

02:33.879 --> 02:35.881
living off the grid.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.059
What?

02:47.476 --> 02:50.771
tense music

02:50.938 --> 02:52.564
Oh, God.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.400
What?

02:57.278 --> 02:58.779
Uh...

03:31.312 --> 03:33.856
"No Return" by Craig Wedren
and Anna Waronker

03:43.657 --> 03:46.118
It was cool, nothing fire

03:46.535 --> 03:48.871
Nothing broke

03:50.372 --> 03:51.123
Keep simple

03:51.665 --> 03:53.876
Nothing tired, nothing old

03:56.628 --> 04:00.341
Same as you

04:02.551 --> 04:06.847
Same as you

04:07.890 --> 04:10.601
Oh, so cute, so revival

04:10.976 --> 04:13.395
So alone

04:13.896 --> 04:16.982
Birthday suit, just a smile

04:17.399 --> 04:20.986
No one home

04:21.403 --> 04:24.907
Same as you

04:27.034 --> 04:31.246
Same as you

04:31.663 --> 04:34.875
vocalizing

04:37.753 --> 04:40.005
No return, no return

04:40.422 --> 04:42.424
No reason

04:42.883 --> 04:45.094
No return, no return

04:45.511 --> 04:47.846
No reason

04:48.222 --> 04:50.641
No return, no return

04:50.933 --> 04:52.726
No reason

04:53.185 --> 04:55.145
No return, no return

04:55.562 --> 04:58.107
No reason

05:03.028 --> 05:05.155
So, the tow company,
they just found our van

05:05.572 --> 05:08.033
on the side of the road?

05:08.409 --> 05:09.743
Uh, yeah.

05:10.119 --> 05:12.704
How lucky are we, right?

05:12.913 --> 05:14.581
Lucky.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.458
Sure.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.670
Good morning, sweetie.

05:20.587 --> 05:23.424
I'm hanging with
Alana tonight. Bye.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.300
Good to know.

05:25.759 --> 05:26.301
I'm going to Kohl's.

05:26.802 --> 05:29.012
They're having a sale, um...

05:29.638 --> 05:32.558
You like the odor-resistant
crew socks, right?

05:35.936 --> 05:38.897
They know about the affair.

05:39.773 --> 05:40.941
- Who?
- The cops.

05:41.442 --> 05:42.776
The cops know about the affair.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.027
What?

05:44.778 --> 05:46.363
Mm, I overheard them
talking about it at the gym.

05:46.822 --> 05:47.573
How would they know?

05:48.157 --> 05:50.492
You did spend a lot
of time with him.

05:50.993 --> 05:52.828
Like you said, public places.

05:53.162 --> 05:54.663
Small town, Shauna.

05:54.955 --> 05:55.622
You're right.

05:56.165 --> 05:58.125
I should've just
run around in a ski mask.

05:58.500 --> 05:59.251
Also in public.

05:59.751 --> 06:02.004
Blackmailing people.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.186
dramatic music

06:26.987 --> 06:28.363
Where you going
dressed like that?

06:28.864 --> 06:31.783
The bank.
Why are you here?

06:32.159 --> 06:33.827
I need those keys.

06:34.203 --> 06:35.537
I was gonna go help Lisa

06:36.038 --> 06:37.247
run the Farmer's Market booth.

06:37.831 --> 06:40.459
She normally
does that with Todd.

06:41.001 --> 06:44.296
You don't strike me
as someone with...

06:44.838 --> 06:46.548
enthusiastic
honey-selling skills.

06:47.341 --> 06:50.427
Actually, I thought it'd be
a good time for us to bond,

06:50.969 --> 06:54.306
also since she forgave me for...

06:54.806 --> 06:57.559
stabbing her in the face.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.855
All right. Yeah.

07:02.064 --> 07:04.191
But, uh...

07:04.566 --> 07:05.359
Let her drive.

07:05.817 --> 07:07.361
She never gets to and...

07:07.861 --> 07:09.112
she needs the practice.

07:09.655 --> 07:10.656
You have reached

07:11.532 --> 07:13.700
Senator Taissa Turner.
Leave a message after the beep.

07:14.576 --> 07:16.912
I'm getting really worried
that you're not calling me back.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.997
Either of you.

07:19.540 --> 07:22.209
Don't make me come
looking for you.

07:24.378 --> 07:25.712
If Taissa and Shauna have both

07:26.547 --> 07:30.050
been kidnapped, I am going
to be very, very annoyed.

07:30.551 --> 07:33.428
I'm sure they're just busy.

07:33.929 --> 07:34.596
They're all lucky to have you.

07:35.097 --> 07:35.973
It's pretty rare
to have a friend

07:36.557 --> 07:38.225
who's relentlessly
got your back.

07:39.059 --> 07:42.688
Thank you.

07:46.275 --> 07:47.067
Here.

07:47.693 --> 07:48.694
I've got a good
distraction for you

07:49.403 --> 07:51.863
as you wait for your friends'
imminent replies.

07:52.698 --> 07:54.449
You can choose the music
for the rest of the trip.

07:54.950 --> 07:55.742
And I won't complain at all.

07:55.951 --> 07:58.412
Well...

07:58.912 --> 08:00.706
- It all makes sense now.
- What?

08:01.915 --> 08:03.041
Why you sought me out.

08:03.417 --> 08:04.501
Why you're helping me.

08:04.960 --> 08:06.628
You certainly did your homework.

08:07.129 --> 08:09.631
What are you talking about?

08:10.215 --> 08:11.800
You can drop
the whole thing now, okay?

08:12.634 --> 08:14.428
You're one of those
Yellowjackets obsessives.

08:15.262 --> 08:18.599
And I'm honored that I seem to
be your favorite Yellowjacket,

08:19.141 --> 08:20.976
but I am not gonna
tell you anything

08:21.435 --> 08:22.019
about what happened out there.

08:22.394 --> 08:23.312
So, you can just...

08:23.812 --> 08:24.521
drop me off at the next town.

08:25.147 --> 08:26.982
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not
what's happening.

08:27.482 --> 08:29.151
It's like I told you:

08:29.776 --> 08:31.570
I-I sought you out
from Citizen Detective

08:32.154 --> 08:33.155
because I wanted to work
with the brilliant

08:33.780 --> 08:36.575
investigative mind
that is Agent AfricanGrey.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.369
And because you dropped
a Sweeney Todd reference

08:39.786 --> 08:40.662
in one of your posts.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.914
Look, I-I don't care...
Uh, no offense,

08:43.790 --> 08:45.667
because I'm sure it was
a significant trauma, but...

08:46.293 --> 08:47.669
I don't care that
you're a Yellowjacket.

08:48.170 --> 08:49.421
That was like 30 years ago.

08:49.796 --> 08:50.589
Twenty-five.

08:51.256 --> 08:54.635
And it's the least
interesting thing about you.

08:55.844 --> 08:57.429
So, you just...

08:57.846 --> 09:00.098
happen to love musicals?

09:00.682 --> 09:02.100
And it has nothing
to do with me?

09:02.309 --> 09:03.435
Yep.

09:03.810 --> 09:04.645
Well...

09:05.187 --> 09:06.188
I don't really care
about musicals,

09:06.647 --> 09:08.273
- or what we listen to.
- Oh.

09:08.982 --> 09:12.319
Well, so then you won't be
bothered if I put on...

09:16.657 --> 09:17.824
Oh, let's tell
the story of Cinderella,

09:18.659 --> 09:20.869
except every
character's a train? Ugh.

09:21.203 --> 09:22.954
Enough already.

09:26.875 --> 09:29.753
People of Europe!

09:30.295 --> 09:33.423
I send you the Rainbow

09:33.840 --> 09:38.053
Of Argentina

09:40.013 --> 09:40.931
People of Europe!

09:41.807 --> 09:46.228
I send you the Rainbow
of Argentina

09:51.358 --> 09:54.403
Thank God, because I am tired
of starling soup.

09:56.071 --> 09:57.364
So who's the thief?

09:58.990 --> 10:02.703
Someone stole some bear meat
from the shed.

10:03.245 --> 10:04.621
I guess they think
they deserve more

10:05.080 --> 10:06.415
than the rest of us, which...

10:06.915 --> 10:07.833
at this point, is pretty fucked.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.293
If anybody, I'm the one who
should be taking some more,

10:11.044 --> 10:14.506
except I'm not because
I'm not the fucking worst.

10:14.923 --> 10:16.383
So which one of you is?

10:19.386 --> 10:23.390
Okay. Right. Whatever.

10:29.938 --> 10:30.731
It was probably him.

10:31.273 --> 10:33.775
He thinks he's so much
better than us.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.611
I didn't take the fucking meat.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.155
Okay? And in case you forgot,

10:38.697 --> 10:41.408
not exactly nimble in the snow.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.539
But you know what?

10:48.248 --> 10:51.501
If it had been me, what exactly
would you do about it?

10:51.960 --> 10:53.670
Would you eat me?

10:54.212 --> 10:56.089
dark, threatening music

10:56.465 --> 10:59.676
Let's all chill, you guys.

11:00.302 --> 11:01.386
There's just no way
that Coach would ever--

11:01.928 --> 11:03.263
This is all because
of you, you know.

11:03.889 --> 11:06.641
- Excuse me?
- Why we don't have any meat.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.101
Lottie tries to bless you
for the hunt,

11:08.935 --> 11:10.020
but half the time you're MIA.
Or when you do show up,

11:10.812 --> 11:13.356
it's like you're practically
holding your nose.

11:13.774 --> 11:14.733
Are you joking?

11:15.484 --> 11:18.361
You actually think that's
why we can't find any game?

11:18.779 --> 11:19.696
Because of me?

11:20.238 --> 11:23.533
I'm the only one
that's even trying.

11:23.950 --> 11:24.743
Me and Travis.

11:25.452 --> 11:26.411
While the rest of you guys
are just fucking sitting

11:26.995 --> 11:27.788
- on your asses.
- If there isn't any game,

11:28.330 --> 11:29.664
then how did
Lottie get the birds?

11:30.165 --> 11:32.417
Um, Lottie didn't get the birds.

11:32.918 --> 11:33.335
They flew into the cabin.

11:33.835 --> 11:35.003
Because she told them to.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.088
It did happen when
the blood dripped on

11:37.506 --> 11:38.590
the symbol that she made.

11:39.174 --> 11:39.925
We're still not really
sure that's why.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.719
Yeah, you see, that's what
we call a coincidence.

11:43.178 --> 11:44.721
Okay? Those birds were just...

11:45.138 --> 11:45.806
like, confused, or...

11:46.348 --> 11:47.641
they had a disease,
or something.

11:48.099 --> 11:48.850
No, if they were diseased,

11:49.476 --> 11:51.353
then we would've gotten sick
from eating them.

11:51.812 --> 11:52.854
What about the bear?

11:53.355 --> 11:54.523
I don't think anyone
who saw that

11:55.023 --> 11:55.565
could call it a coincidence.

11:56.107 --> 11:58.693
Exactly.
It all goes to show:

11:59.194 --> 12:00.070
the only food we've had
in months

12:00.487 --> 12:01.196
is thanks to Lottie.

12:01.655 --> 12:04.407
Then we should have a contest.

12:04.866 --> 12:07.744
Yeah? One-on-one.

12:08.203 --> 12:09.037
We both go out, just her and me,

12:09.830 --> 12:10.831
and then at the end
of the day, we see who

12:11.373 --> 12:12.582
makes it back here
with more food.

12:13.041 --> 12:15.627
Come on, Nat, that's not fair.

12:16.044 --> 12:16.795
Lottie isn't a hunter.

12:17.462 --> 12:19.673
According to them,
she's better than a hunter.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.467
enchanting music

12:33.395 --> 12:35.647
Surprised you wanted
to do this with me.

12:36.231 --> 12:38.024
I needed a break
from the compound.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.944
Plus, I figured
I owe you for the...

12:41.570 --> 12:44.823
It-It's fine.
It's fine. It-it feels better.

12:45.490 --> 12:48.410
So Lottie only lets you guys
leave the compound

12:49.035 --> 12:50.537
once a week for the market
and that's it?

12:51.079 --> 12:53.039
No, we're allowed to leave
whenever we want,

12:53.874 --> 12:56.001
for as many days
as we want, it's just

12:56.877 --> 12:57.961
Charlotte needs me to lead
a lot of the workshops

12:58.545 --> 12:59.963
back at the compound,
so I'm always busy.

13:00.589 --> 13:02.507
Don't you think it's weird
to even have a rule

13:03.049 --> 13:04.384
that you get to leave
whenever you want

13:04.885 --> 13:06.595
for as many days as you want?

13:07.387 --> 13:09.973
Almost like she wants
to give the illusion of freedom

13:10.432 --> 13:12.684
so that you'll always come back?

13:13.101 --> 13:14.561
Okay, that is a reach.

13:15.103 --> 13:16.730
It's... It's not a rule,
it's just something

13:17.355 --> 13:18.857
that she says
in her welcome speech.

13:19.441 --> 13:21.192
There are no rules
at the compound, really.

13:21.610 --> 13:22.819
Are you kidding?

13:23.361 --> 13:26.406
Only what to wear, what to say,

13:26.781 --> 13:27.741
what meetings to attend...

13:28.366 --> 13:30.619
We do all of that
because we want to.

13:31.745 --> 13:35.582
So, everyone's favorite color
just happens to be--

13:36.082 --> 13:36.917
- Purple, yeah.
- Purple?

13:37.417 --> 13:38.919
Some people at the compound

13:39.461 --> 13:41.129
come from a lot of money,
others don't.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.089
Charlotte wanted
everyone to be equal there.

13:43.632 --> 13:46.551
She didn't ask you
to give up anything?

13:47.052 --> 13:49.179
Only the bad parts.

13:49.554 --> 13:50.180
The unhelpful parts.

13:50.555 --> 13:51.139
What does that mean?

13:51.973 --> 13:54.225
Look, you don't take this
seriously, I get it.

13:54.601 --> 13:55.602
I didn't either at first.

13:55.936 --> 13:57.812
So...

13:58.146 --> 14:00.273
what changed?

14:01.066 --> 14:02.609
Me.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.113
It's weird

14:07.989 --> 14:10.075
Dr. Graham didn't tell me
he was taking a sabbatical.

14:10.784 --> 14:12.827
I think
it was a last-minute thing.

14:13.453 --> 14:16.081
But I promise I'm
up to date on your file.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.207
Okay.

14:17.999 --> 14:19.292
But I am curious,
you've been seeing Dr. Graham

14:20.168 --> 14:23.004
at a fixed time every six months
for the past ten years

14:23.964 --> 14:26.299
and it says here you're not
due for another five weeks.

14:26.508 --> 14:27.133
What's up?

14:27.676 --> 14:29.719
I was hoping he would
up my meds.

14:30.136 --> 14:30.887
Can you do that?

14:31.429 --> 14:32.097
I certainly have the power to,

14:32.639 --> 14:35.642
but why do you want
to up your meds?

14:37.519 --> 14:39.688
Uh, well, you read about...

14:40.313 --> 14:42.399
what happened back
when I was a kid, I assume?

14:42.774 --> 14:44.859
I started having...

14:45.276 --> 14:46.945
visions again.

14:47.362 --> 14:49.197
For the first time in...

14:49.489 --> 14:51.825
in decades.

14:52.325 --> 14:55.328
And it keeps happening.

14:55.704 --> 14:57.998
And it needs to stop.

14:59.374 --> 15:01.543
They need to stop.

15:04.379 --> 15:07.340
The last time, it was, um...

15:07.841 --> 15:08.717
became something different.

15:09.175 --> 15:11.344
Can't happen again.

15:14.055 --> 15:15.974
I've worked really hard.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.810
And I've built
something that's...

15:20.395 --> 15:22.856
...it's helping people.

15:23.231 --> 15:25.066
It's helping me.

15:28.570 --> 15:30.030
Can't go back.

15:32.073 --> 15:35.326
Before we talk
about your dosage,

15:36.202 --> 15:38.288
I would urge you to reframe
the way you're thinking

15:38.663 --> 15:39.205
about these visions.

15:39.748 --> 15:41.750
The stress of constantly
pushing them away

15:42.375 --> 15:44.961
could potentially cause
more to surface, so...

15:45.378 --> 15:47.589
maybe ask yourself...

15:48.214 --> 15:50.341
what do you think
they're trying to tell you?

15:50.550 --> 15:51.718
Nothing.

15:52.218 --> 15:53.678
quiet, tense music

15:56.890 --> 15:59.434
Because they're not real.

16:03.104 --> 16:06.983
Okay, so one-on-one means
no assistance of any kind.

16:07.609 --> 16:09.319
If you get a kill,
just leave it where it is

16:10.111 --> 16:11.154
and we will come
and help you bring it back.

16:11.780 --> 16:14.115
You, yourself, have to
be back before sundown,

16:14.741 --> 16:15.742
or you're automatically disqualified.

16:16.242 --> 16:16.910
If you're not back by then,

16:17.452 --> 16:18.536
we'll come out
and we'll find you.

16:18.912 --> 16:20.830
Oh, and for weapons...

16:21.289 --> 16:22.791
we only have...

16:23.374 --> 16:26.461
one gun, so, um, maybe
you can draw cards--

16:26.920 --> 16:29.464
Lottie doesn't need a gun.

16:31.299 --> 16:32.634
Okay.

16:36.554 --> 16:38.556
soft, melancholic music

18:17.697 --> 18:19.365
Fuck me.

18:45.099 --> 18:46.851
suspenseful music

19:09.374 --> 19:10.250
Shauna?

19:10.750 --> 19:12.752
- Hi.
- Oh, hey, Michelle.

19:13.253 --> 19:14.545
- How's everything?
- Good.

19:14.796 --> 19:16.256
Yeah, um...

19:16.798 --> 19:18.091
Oh, I've been meaning
to thank you

19:18.716 --> 19:19.884
for having Callie
sleep over so much.

19:20.551 --> 19:22.136
I should cut you a check
for her room and board.

19:22.553 --> 19:23.846
Sorry, but...

19:24.472 --> 19:27.976
Callie hasn't slept over
at our house in weeks.

19:32.814 --> 19:34.732
tense, percussive music

20:23.448 --> 20:25.408
Mom...?

20:25.533 --> 20:26.534
Hi.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.202
Come on, get in.

20:28.828 --> 20:31.080
Thought we could go
somewhere and, uh...

20:31.497 --> 20:32.498
have some fun.

20:32.707 --> 20:34.542
Where?

20:34.876 --> 20:36.044
I don't know yet.

20:36.461 --> 20:37.879
That's what's fun.

20:50.475 --> 20:53.561
In small towns, everyone knows
who and where the weirdos are.

20:54.479 --> 20:55.897
Wait, you can't just ask
the waitress where the cult is.

20:56.481 --> 20:57.398
- Yes, I can.
- What if she's one of them

20:57.899 --> 20:58.733
and gives us false information?

20:59.025 --> 20:59.859
Oh, what if she--

21:00.485 --> 21:02.987
Is there anything else
I can get for you?

21:07.408 --> 21:09.535
No, thank you.

21:26.761 --> 21:28.846
Okay...

21:29.222 --> 21:31.891
What is your... deal?

21:32.183 --> 21:32.975
Elaborate?

21:33.601 --> 21:36.229
Um, well, I mean, how
can you just be here?

21:36.729 --> 21:38.231
Do you not... have a job?

21:38.606 --> 21:39.315
Oh, no.

21:39.774 --> 21:41.651
I haven't had a job in years.

21:42.026 --> 21:42.819
I'm a millionaire.

21:43.403 --> 21:44.779
A multi-millionaire, technically.

21:45.071 --> 21:45.988
No, you're not.

21:46.614 --> 21:47.448
Remember that scaffolding
company that got sued

21:48.074 --> 21:49.575
a few years back when
their beams came loose

21:50.118 --> 21:52.078
and caused a torrent
of bricks to hit

21:52.620 --> 21:53.663
that poor guy who was
walking under it?

21:54.455 --> 21:56.082
Well, he had to have
a metal plate put in his head,

21:56.624 --> 21:58.918
ad settled in court
for six million dollars.

22:00.795 --> 22:01.504
Yeah, the whole thing's
on YouTube.

22:02.130 --> 22:03.047
Even the experts don't know
how I survived.

22:03.548 --> 22:04.257
Do you want to see?

22:05.091 --> 22:07.593
Excuse me. Do you know about
the cult with the purple people?

22:08.136 --> 22:09.095
- What did you--
- We are wasting time.

22:09.637 --> 22:10.471
Yes, they're awful tippers.

22:11.055 --> 22:12.265
Well, would you happen to know

22:12.765 --> 22:13.724
where we might find them?

22:14.142 --> 22:14.892
Uh, they sell their honey

22:15.435 --> 22:17.019
at the Farmer's Market
every Tuesday.

22:17.478 --> 22:19.021
Today is Tuesday.

22:19.439 --> 22:19.939
Yeah, I know.

22:20.565 --> 22:22.442
Come on with that luck.

22:22.900 --> 22:24.569
low, droning music

22:48.968 --> 22:50.720
suspenseful music

22:58.102 --> 23:00.146
Where you headed?

23:01.314 --> 23:02.190
Um...

23:02.607 --> 23:03.774
Going west?

23:04.150 --> 23:05.985
Do you want a ride?

23:06.944 --> 23:08.446
Uh, I-- no, I-I can...

23:09.030 --> 23:12.408
Hey. Full disclosure,
I voted for you.

23:12.825 --> 23:14.076
Oh. Thank you.

23:14.619 --> 23:17.246
I-I don't normally
hitchhike and...

23:17.663 --> 23:19.207
look like this.

23:19.665 --> 23:20.374
Ah, it's all right.

23:20.875 --> 23:21.501
Kind of makes me like you more.

23:22.126 --> 23:23.252
If state senators
can have a bad day,

23:23.669 --> 23:24.921
so can all of us, huh?

23:26.297 --> 23:29.175
Where were you when I was
coming up with campaign slogans?

23:29.550 --> 23:31.010
Come on in.

23:34.180 --> 23:35.515
Huh.

23:39.894 --> 23:40.686
Uh, uh...

23:40.978 --> 23:42.230
No, I just--

23:42.730 --> 23:44.106
How much do you want for it?

24:01.916 --> 24:04.043
There's that dripping again.

24:05.586 --> 24:07.213
Did no one hear that?

24:10.758 --> 24:13.678
I'm gonna find out
where it's coming from.

24:14.762 --> 24:16.931
Help me look?

24:18.057 --> 24:19.559
I'm kind of busy right now.

24:20.184 --> 24:22.144
News flash: you don't
have to take the SAT.

24:22.270 --> 24:23.145
I do.

24:23.896 --> 24:26.774
Because when we get back,
I'll still be a junior.

24:27.066 --> 24:29.902
Okay, fine.

24:31.612 --> 24:34.574
But can you please
just look with me?

24:37.285 --> 24:39.078
Fine.

24:40.580 --> 24:43.124
Guess I'll check the pantry.

24:44.375 --> 24:46.043
quiet, tense music

24:56.304 --> 24:58.180
Hey.

24:58.806 --> 25:01.976
Hey, how long have
you been in here, mister?

25:03.978 --> 25:06.314
I'm not gonna hurt you,
it's okay.

25:06.731 --> 25:08.941
Come on...

25:09.150 --> 25:10.192
That's it.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.236
There you go.

25:12.612 --> 25:14.238
Hi.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.532
Hi. Hello.

25:16.949 --> 25:19.327
You finding anything?

25:19.785 --> 25:21.746
No. Nothing.

25:31.005 --> 25:33.090
Hi.

25:38.971 --> 25:40.431
dark, ominous music

27:13.357 --> 27:16.736
Holy fucking shit.

27:24.910 --> 27:25.578
Mm.

27:26.078 --> 27:27.830
This is a shitty
Farmer's Market.

27:28.372 --> 27:31.584
No, this is, uh, my mom's house.

27:32.042 --> 27:33.836
I want to see my fish.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.255
His name is the 14th Gilly
and he's so cute.

27:36.797 --> 27:37.923
But Todd never lets me
make any stops

27:38.758 --> 27:40.134
other than the bank
and the market.

27:40.968 --> 27:44.764
So, can you just, like, not tell
Charlotte that we came here?

27:46.223 --> 27:47.349
Oh, so there are no rules,

27:47.975 --> 27:49.602
but you're not allowed
to see your family?

27:50.144 --> 27:50.936
Uh, no, it's not
that we're not allowed,

27:51.812 --> 27:53.689
it's that Charlotte doesn't
think it's a good idea.

27:54.315 --> 27:56.484
She says that our anchors
are at the compound.

27:56.817 --> 27:58.277
Not out here.

27:58.444 --> 28:00.279
Right...

28:12.291 --> 28:14.168
Oh, honey...

28:14.627 --> 28:16.796
I'm so glad that you're home.

28:17.338 --> 28:18.672
Your room is exactly
how you left it.

28:19.298 --> 28:22.176
Uh... Well, I clean
the sheets once a week.

28:22.635 --> 28:23.886
I'm not actually here to stay.

28:24.470 --> 28:27.723
Just... came to see
the 14th Gilly and...

28:28.140 --> 28:29.850
say hi and...

28:30.434 --> 28:31.602
let you know that I'm doing
really great.

28:32.019 --> 28:33.562
And that I'm happy.

28:34.021 --> 28:35.022
Right, Natalie?

28:35.356 --> 28:37.525
Great. And happy.

28:39.276 --> 28:40.361
Are you still taking
your medication?

28:40.986 --> 28:44.782
No, but I got help
to ween myself off of it.

28:45.199 --> 28:46.742
And I feel a lot better.

28:47.201 --> 28:48.786
It's not cloudy in here anymore.

28:49.203 --> 28:49.912
It wasn't cloudy before.

28:50.538 --> 28:52.289
Well, I don't know,
maybe it was because--

28:52.498 --> 28:53.290
Don't.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.376
I know that you're
depressed, Lisa.

28:55.835 --> 28:56.794
I know that you can't see it,

28:57.211 --> 28:59.296
but I can always tell.

28:59.672 --> 29:02.299
Yes, I am still depressed

29:02.842 --> 29:04.176
because it's kind of
a forever thing,

29:04.552 --> 29:05.427
but I'm doing real work.

29:06.178 --> 29:09.557
I'm confronting the feeling
and not numbing it.

29:10.015 --> 29:11.141
That's the routine.

29:11.517 --> 29:14.061
Confront, acknowledge,

29:14.353 --> 29:14.854
let it go.

29:15.354 --> 29:16.355
That's not a real routine.

29:16.981 --> 29:19.066
If it works for her,
what does it matter?

29:19.984 --> 29:21.026
Do you know what? Do you mind
stepping out for a minute

29:21.861 --> 29:24.196
so that I can talk
to my daughter alone?

29:33.247 --> 29:34.540
Mom, why are we
all the way out here?

29:35.040 --> 29:38.335
And where even is here?

29:41.171 --> 29:43.507
No bars?

29:43.924 --> 29:45.551
Seriously, where are we?

29:46.552 --> 29:48.262
Mom.

29:51.390 --> 29:53.058
What...?

30:15.247 --> 30:16.123
So...

30:16.916 --> 30:19.627
I know that you've
been lying about...

30:20.085 --> 30:21.837
sleeping at Alana's.

30:22.630 --> 30:26.926
Is there anything else you've
lied about that I need to know?

30:31.972 --> 30:34.391
Okay...

30:36.101 --> 30:39.229
First of all, Mom,
this is like...

30:39.438 --> 30:41.231
so much.

30:42.066 --> 30:43.567
And second, is there anything
you've lied about

30:44.068 --> 30:44.860
that I need to know?

30:45.611 --> 30:47.488
Like maybe why you wanted
to burn that guy Adam's

30:47.988 --> 30:50.115
driver's license
out of existence?

30:52.409 --> 30:53.160
Okay...

30:53.953 --> 30:55.621
And I swear to God, Mom,
if you lie to me again,

30:55.955 --> 30:56.580
I am so...

30:57.122 --> 31:00.960
fucking over secrets.
Like, I can't.

31:02.169 --> 31:03.879
Did you...

31:04.296 --> 31:06.215
kill that guy?

31:06.340 --> 31:08.008
Did Dad?

31:09.093 --> 31:11.679
Okay, okay, you know what?
You're right.

31:12.972 --> 31:14.974
No more secrets.

31:17.309 --> 31:20.145
Yes. I-I killed Adam.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.731
But he was blackmailing
my friends.

31:23.148 --> 31:23.941
My-my teammates.

31:24.358 --> 31:25.693
Oh, fuck, no, actually...

31:26.318 --> 31:29.196
That's a lie. Adam, uh,
was not the blackmailer.

31:29.989 --> 31:31.907
But at first I thought
that he was, so...

31:32.324 --> 31:33.659
Oh, my fucking God.

31:34.034 --> 31:35.786
So, you...

31:36.203 --> 31:37.287
you killed a person?

31:38.163 --> 31:43.127
Like an innocent person
who did not deserve to die.

31:43.335 --> 31:45.337
I...

31:45.629 --> 31:46.463
Yeah.

31:47.047 --> 31:48.465
I knew that Dad
didn't have anything

31:48.841 --> 31:49.842
to do with any of this.

31:50.342 --> 31:51.677
I knew that it was all you.

31:52.678 --> 31:54.138
Actually, you know,
your dad is not

31:54.680 --> 31:58.183
so squeaky clean
in all this, Callie.

31:58.392 --> 31:59.309
He...

31:59.727 --> 32:01.145
He was the blackmailer.

32:01.687 --> 32:03.439
Okay. Everything
about this sucks.

32:03.897 --> 32:05.107
- I know.
- So you're saying that...

32:05.691 --> 32:07.985
he's the reason that
this entire thing happened

32:08.527 --> 32:09.695
and that you're
now a murderer?

32:10.154 --> 32:12.698
No. No, no, no. You...

32:13.073 --> 32:14.366
I mean...

32:14.658 --> 32:15.784
Yes, kind of.

32:16.326 --> 32:19.872
But he's not a bad person, okay?

32:20.372 --> 32:21.874
He's just a bad criminal.

32:22.416 --> 32:23.250
But why did he think
that he could

32:24.043 --> 32:25.002
blackmail the Yellowjackets
for money?

32:25.419 --> 32:27.796
Because they did, they...

32:28.213 --> 32:29.548
haunting music

32:30.049 --> 32:33.510
We did things out there that...

32:36.221 --> 32:37.848
...we're really ashamed of.

32:38.182 --> 32:40.059
And...

32:41.602 --> 32:43.020
Sorry, I know...

32:43.604 --> 32:44.980
Maybe one day I can talk
to you about it,

32:45.397 --> 32:48.025
but for now, um...

32:48.442 --> 32:50.736
can that just be enough?

32:53.572 --> 32:55.449
Yeah.

32:57.284 --> 32:58.786
Thanks.

33:05.459 --> 33:07.211
Callie...

33:08.295 --> 33:10.464
Cal, you...

33:12.716 --> 33:15.135
You cannot tell
anyone about this.

33:15.719 --> 33:19.098
Do you promise
you won't tell anybody?

33:20.224 --> 33:22.142
I won't.

33:23.894 --> 33:25.604
I promise.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.108
Okay.

33:29.608 --> 33:33.112
So, I've been making a map

33:33.904 --> 33:36.240
of the trees that you've been
leading me to and, um,

33:36.782 --> 33:38.200
this is a map that
Coach Scott made,

33:38.784 --> 33:40.202
not with me, but it's
pretty accurate, I think.

33:40.953 --> 33:44.039
So I just transferred my map
onto it and then I marked

33:44.456 --> 33:45.541
all of the symbol trees.

33:45.916 --> 33:46.667
Like this is the one

33:47.292 --> 33:48.460
right by the gorge,
and this is the one

33:48.836 --> 33:49.962
that you found last night.

33:50.462 --> 33:53.632
You see it, don't you?

33:53.924 --> 33:55.676
See what?

33:57.928 --> 33:59.596
atmospheric music

34:03.308 --> 34:04.852
Van, this is just, like,
a bunch of random points.

34:05.435 --> 34:06.854
You can make any kind
of shape from these.

34:07.271 --> 34:08.856
Are you...?

34:09.815 --> 34:11.275
I don't understand.

34:11.817 --> 34:14.069
I don't understand
why you won't see

34:14.528 --> 34:16.530
what's right in front of you.

34:18.699 --> 34:20.826
Look, I understand
you're trying to help me.

34:21.326 --> 34:22.744
And I'm grateful, but...

34:23.328 --> 34:24.329
it's possible that this
is all just meaningless.

34:25.164 --> 34:27.875
Yeah, it's possible. It's also
possible that I am right.

34:28.208 --> 34:31.170
And if I am...

34:31.670 --> 34:32.963
then there should be a tree

34:33.380 --> 34:34.339
with a symbol on it,

34:34.673 --> 34:35.674
right here.

34:36.216 --> 34:40.679
Will you come and look
for it with me?

35:08.540 --> 35:10.918
Oh, look what you found.

35:20.886 --> 35:22.221
Oh, this one.

35:22.763 --> 35:23.847
Took me to a bakery
for breakfast

35:24.556 --> 35:27.434
and selected me a bagel
from the day-old bin.

35:28.268 --> 35:31.480
You'll be shocked
to hear we didn't last.

35:31.605 --> 35:33.774
Oh.

35:34.233 --> 35:36.777
That guy. Eh...

35:39.279 --> 35:41.615
- Ben.
- Yeah.

35:42.074 --> 35:43.200
Do you not have a box like this?

35:43.617 --> 35:46.161
Of sentimental, mostly...

35:46.620 --> 35:48.914
- meaningless things that--
- No.

35:50.749 --> 35:52.084
No, that's the thing, I-I don't.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.878
I-I mean, I have boxes of...

35:55.420 --> 35:58.882
trophies and old
soccer cleats, but...

36:00.092 --> 36:02.052
No, I don't have that kind of...

36:02.386 --> 36:04.096
history.

36:04.596 --> 36:06.181
That's exactly what this is.

36:06.598 --> 36:08.850
It's history.

36:09.268 --> 36:11.019
This is my past.

36:11.436 --> 36:12.729
And you, Ben...

36:13.105 --> 36:15.941
mm, you are my future.

36:31.790 --> 36:33.917
I know how to handle you.

36:34.334 --> 36:35.335
I know what you need.

36:35.961 --> 36:38.505
I know what to do when you
make another attempt.

36:39.298 --> 36:41.508
I haven't ideated suicide
in three months, Mom.

36:42.301 --> 36:44.219
That's huge for me.
If you can't see that...

36:44.845 --> 36:46.805
maybe we don't need
to have a relationship.

36:47.306 --> 36:48.307
I'll just take Gilly and go.

36:49.141 --> 36:51.977
Just because you're
a cult's responsibility now,

36:52.519 --> 36:54.313
doesn't mean that part
of you is gone.

36:54.855 --> 36:57.065
You can't take care
of yourself, honey.

36:57.482 --> 36:58.150
Let alone a fish.

36:58.692 --> 36:59.443
- He's a fish.
- That you will kill.

36:59.985 --> 37:01.987
Not by forgetting
to feed it, but by

37:02.779 --> 37:05.324
opening your arteries
and leaving it alone to starve.

37:05.866 --> 37:07.034
What the fuck is wrong with you

37:07.617 --> 37:09.161
that you can't let
your daughter be happy?

37:09.661 --> 37:10.996
You say you're her mom,

37:11.496 --> 37:12.414
but you only care about you.

37:12.998 --> 37:14.291
You don't even see what
you're saying and doing,

37:14.708 --> 37:15.751
how it's affecting her--

37:16.126 --> 37:18.879
You're not helping!

37:22.883 --> 37:25.344
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

37:25.886 --> 37:28.096
I love you even when you
try to control me.

37:28.555 --> 37:30.098
But I'm okay now!

37:34.186 --> 37:35.270
Bye, Mom.

37:43.862 --> 37:45.989
I'm sorry
I snapped at you.

37:46.531 --> 37:47.324
I know you were just
trying to help

37:47.908 --> 37:49.701
and I didn't mean to
make it into...

37:50.160 --> 37:52.537
whatever that was, but...

37:54.831 --> 37:57.042
Here's your fucking fish.

38:06.885 --> 38:07.552
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:08.387 --> 38:09.596
Is this where
the purple people are?

38:09.930 --> 38:10.889
Sunshine Honey?

38:11.264 --> 38:12.182
It's supposed to be, yeah.

38:12.766 --> 38:13.558
Do you know where
their place is?

38:14.393 --> 38:17.813
Not super sure, but they're
up in some rural area.

38:18.188 --> 38:19.314
Like next town over.

38:19.731 --> 38:22.150
Off Route 19, somewhere.

38:22.734 --> 38:23.402
Okay, I don't like this at all.

38:23.944 --> 38:24.778
We need to get to Route 19,
right now.

38:25.237 --> 38:26.279
Whoa, whoa, it's getting dark.

38:26.905 --> 38:27.864
We don't know what
we'd be up against.

38:28.240 --> 38:28.990
We'd be at a disadvantage.

38:29.533 --> 38:30.700
We'd have the element
of surprise.

38:31.076 --> 38:31.743
If I'm a cult leader,

38:32.619 --> 38:33.537
I'd like you to think you had
the element of surprise.

38:34.079 --> 38:36.373
I had a feeling
this could happen.

38:36.873 --> 38:37.958
There's a local B nearby.

38:38.542 --> 38:41.044
I say we surprise them
in the morning.

38:46.258 --> 38:47.926
Fine.

38:48.969 --> 38:51.471
Guys, I found a fucking moose.

38:51.930 --> 38:53.640
Wait... found but didn't kill?

38:54.474 --> 38:56.518
No, it's dead, it's frozen
in the surface of the lake.

38:57.269 --> 38:59.229
I'm gonna need a lot of help
to get it out of there.

38:59.604 --> 39:01.773
Here.

39:01.982 --> 39:02.649
Take this.

39:03.442 --> 39:04.359
And everyone dress
as warmly as you can.

39:04.943 --> 39:06.194
Hey, I thought the rule
was no assistance.

39:06.778 --> 39:07.404
Oh, my God, Mari, this is food.

39:07.904 --> 39:08.655
If we can get this out,

39:09.448 --> 39:10.740
this moose will probably
feed us till spring.

39:10.949 --> 39:11.908
Misty.

39:12.451 --> 39:13.410
You literally set
the fucking rules.

39:13.952 --> 39:15.495
- I'll tell Lottie.
- Go for it.

39:16.121 --> 39:18.248
Tell her I didn't want us
to fucking starve.

39:18.665 --> 39:20.208
tense music

39:25.755 --> 39:28.133
I hope Lottie's okay.

39:34.097 --> 39:36.141
Of course she is.

39:50.864 --> 39:52.699
optimistic choir music

40:09.549 --> 40:11.218
Hey, Leonard.

41:10.902 --> 41:15.407
It was cool, nothing fire

41:15.865 --> 41:19.244
Nothing broke

41:22.289 --> 41:24.457
That would look
beautiful on you.

41:24.958 --> 41:27.127
Would you like to try it on?

41:27.711 --> 41:31.506
Uh... No, thank you.
I'm-I'm just looking.

41:31.923 --> 41:33.800
Here if you need me.

41:37.220 --> 41:41.933
Same as you

41:44.102 --> 41:46.187
Oh, so cute, so revival

41:46.646 --> 41:48.982
So alone

41:52.319 --> 41:53.862
Birthday suit...

41:54.279 --> 41:55.488
I got that for you.

41:55.905 --> 41:56.406
You look hungry.

41:56.823 --> 42:01.411
No one home

42:01.828 --> 42:06.333
Same as you

42:07.959 --> 42:08.752
Wait.

42:09.628 --> 42:13.131
Don't you think you
should say something first?

42:14.174 --> 42:18.595
Uh, I-I didn't think
that I'd have to.

42:19.012 --> 42:21.806
Oh, you're shivering.

42:23.350 --> 42:26.186
I think I saw a coat
for sale at Abercrombie.

42:26.811 --> 42:29.022
I don't... I don't think
I have a credit card.

42:31.149 --> 42:33.526
When did that ever stop you?

42:33.985 --> 42:36.446
No return, no return

42:36.863 --> 42:37.822
No reason

42:38.365 --> 42:40.075
I think we need to get you
out of here.

42:40.659 --> 42:42.577
No return, no return...

42:43.036 --> 42:43.995
But I just got here.

42:44.496 --> 42:45.538
I don't, I don't want to...

42:45.997 --> 42:46.665
I don't want to leave you.

42:47.165 --> 42:48.166
Lottie.

42:48.708 --> 42:51.252
If you don't get warm,
you're gonna die.

42:51.670 --> 42:52.462
You have to go.

42:52.879 --> 42:54.381
But I...
Go!

42:54.714 --> 42:57.050
Go!

43:05.183 --> 43:06.935
haunting music

43:35.213 --> 43:38.341
Yeah. We're through.

43:48.017 --> 43:50.103
The rope. Come on.

43:52.897 --> 43:54.274
Hold on, hold on.

43:56.109 --> 43:57.569
Pull! Pull harder!

43:58.027 --> 44:00.280
Pull!

44:07.454 --> 44:09.205
intense music

44:09.414 --> 44:10.623
Oh!

44:20.049 --> 44:20.800
- No!
- Hey, hey, no, no.

44:21.426 --> 44:23.094
No, we need it! We need it!

44:23.303 --> 44:23.928
It's gone.

44:24.471 --> 44:27.056
- It is gone.
- We need it. We need it.

44:27.432 --> 44:29.184
haunting music

44:34.439 --> 44:36.316
Are you gonna
kill that fish or what?

44:36.941 --> 44:40.862
I am so afraid I'm gonna
kill this fish.

44:41.446 --> 44:42.989
Do you really think
I can keep him alive?

44:43.281 --> 44:44.157
I have no idea.

44:44.616 --> 44:45.784
But fuck what your mom says.

44:46.493 --> 44:48.411
If you want to kill yourself,
then kill yourself.

44:48.995 --> 44:51.790
But it doesn't look
like you do, today.

44:52.457 --> 44:56.377
So, I think that fish
is gonna survive the night.

44:56.836 --> 44:58.421
And the rest...

44:58.838 --> 45:01.174
worry about it tomorrow.

45:01.466 --> 45:03.927
Right?

45:05.970 --> 45:09.474
You know, I was there when
you had a gun to your head.

45:12.352 --> 45:16.189
Do you still want
to kill yourself?

45:19.984 --> 45:21.444
Not today.

45:23.863 --> 45:24.781
May I take a name for
the reservation, please?

45:25.323 --> 45:26.741
Book it under John Lange, please.

45:27.158 --> 45:27.826
You never want to--

45:28.368 --> 45:29.244
I wasn't going to use
my real name.

45:29.786 --> 45:31.246
And it's just for
one room, right?

45:31.538 --> 45:32.539
- Probably.
- No.

45:32.956 --> 45:33.498
No, yeah, no.

45:33.873 --> 45:34.541
- No.
- No.

45:34.958 --> 45:35.834
Two rooms, please.

45:36.668 --> 45:39.295
And, um, you can put mine under
the name Lady Mallowan.

45:39.671 --> 45:41.130
Okay.

45:41.548 --> 45:42.882
Seventeen and eighteen.

45:43.508 --> 45:44.259
- Thank you.
- Up the stairs to the right.

45:44.843 --> 45:45.677
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you.

45:46.302 --> 45:47.345
- Want help with your bag?
- No, thank you.

45:47.887 --> 45:49.639
"Angst in My Pants"
by Sparks

45:52.183 --> 45:54.811
I hope it doesn't show

45:55.228 --> 45:57.438
It'll go away

45:57.897 --> 46:00.692
It's just a passing phase

46:01.192 --> 46:03.278
It'll go away

46:03.736 --> 46:06.239
You can dress nautical

46:06.698 --> 46:09.242
Learn to tie knots

46:09.701 --> 46:12.245
Take lots of Dramamine

46:12.704 --> 46:14.497
Out on your yacht

46:16.416 --> 46:18.918
But when you're all alone

46:19.419 --> 46:21.045
And nothing bites

46:21.880 --> 46:24.841
You'd wish you'd stayed
at home

46:25.258 --> 46:27.844
With someone nice

46:28.553 --> 46:31.389
But when you think
you made it disappear

46:32.015 --> 46:34.392
It comes again,
hello, I'm here

46:34.934 --> 46:39.439
And I've got angst
in my pants

46:40.565 --> 46:43.568
You can be smart as hell

46:44.068 --> 46:45.862
Know how to add

46:46.404 --> 46:49.198
Know how to figure things

46:49.574 --> 46:52.452
On yellow pads

46:52.911 --> 46:55.622
Answer so no one knows

46:56.080 --> 46:57.999
What you just said

46:58.541 --> 47:01.419
But when you're all alone

47:01.794 --> 47:03.880
You and your head

47:04.631 --> 47:07.884
What's the computer say?
It's mumbling now

47:08.593 --> 47:10.637
It says "Hey Joe,"
it's spelled it out

47:11.220 --> 47:15.683
And you've got angst
in your pants

47:18.227 --> 47:22.482
I've got angst in my pants

47:23.983 --> 47:28.738
I've got angst in my pants

47:31.449 --> 47:32.241
- I was judgy--
- I think we're--

47:32.617 --> 47:34.577
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

47:36.329 --> 47:38.581
You go.

47:38.998 --> 47:41.501
I was judgy today.

47:43.002 --> 47:43.670
I'm sorry.

47:44.253 --> 47:45.755
You know, I mean,
I'm really trying, Shauna.

47:46.172 --> 47:48.800
I'm trying to, like...

47:49.300 --> 47:51.594
get over this... affair

47:52.136 --> 47:53.972
and take the high road,
it's just...

47:54.514 --> 47:57.100
I'm not, I don't,
maybe I'm not fully...

47:57.308 --> 47:58.643
over it.

48:00.311 --> 48:01.688
And I'm sorry.

48:02.021 --> 48:04.941
No. It's okay.

48:05.358 --> 48:07.193
I'm sorry too, I mean...

48:07.485 --> 48:09.654
obviously.

48:10.655 --> 48:13.825
- You go now.
- Okay.

48:14.325 --> 48:15.702
I know everything is...

48:16.494 --> 48:19.247
a lot right now and there's
stuff we don't know and...

48:20.039 --> 48:22.917
there's stuff to be scared of,
but I really think

48:23.376 --> 48:25.753
we're gonna be okay.

48:26.170 --> 48:26.921
Our family, I mean.

48:27.380 --> 48:28.589
The-the three of us.

48:29.007 --> 48:31.175
Yeah. I agree.

48:31.384 --> 48:33.011
Yeah.

48:38.349 --> 48:39.892
Uh...

48:40.351 --> 48:41.019
what do you mean?

48:41.519 --> 48:42.687
I told Callie everything.

48:43.521 --> 48:46.149
You know, she'd already kind
of been thinking it, but...

48:46.399 --> 48:46.983
I just...

48:47.525 --> 48:50.737
confirmed it and,
um, she's okay.

48:51.070 --> 48:53.531
I'm sorry?

48:53.823 --> 48:54.490
You what?

48:55.241 --> 48:59.203
Yeah, Jeff, I know but,
you know, she-she was okay.

49:00.079 --> 49:03.458
I think she was worried
and obviously a little scared,

49:03.833 --> 49:06.419
but she understood.

49:13.217 --> 49:15.053
It's like we only get
one shot at this thing.

49:15.595 --> 49:17.680
You know,
like we only have one kid.

49:18.222 --> 49:20.308
And as parents,
it's part of our job.

49:21.100 --> 49:22.685
We have to protect her,
we have to shield her

49:23.436 --> 49:25.646
from making the same shitty
mistakes we made, Shauna.

49:26.272 --> 49:27.440
To throw our fucking bodies
in front of her

49:27.899 --> 49:28.524
if that's what we have to do.

49:29.067 --> 49:31.486
And, what, you're
telling me you...

49:31.944 --> 49:32.779
you've made her an accomplice.

49:33.404 --> 49:36.282
We are lying to everyone, okay?
Everyone we know.

49:37.116 --> 49:39.577
I don't want to do that
to our own daughter.

49:40.620 --> 49:42.622
Can I, uh...
help cook or something?

49:43.247 --> 49:46.542
Aren't you gonna go
to Alana's tonight?

49:46.751 --> 49:49.128
I...

49:49.754 --> 49:52.340
I haven't been going
to Alana's, I've...

49:53.132 --> 49:56.385
been going to the park
with a friend and...

49:56.594 --> 49:57.595
drinking.

49:57.887 --> 49:58.846
But, um...

49:59.305 --> 50:01.099
I'm not gonna do that anymore.

50:01.933 --> 50:03.851
Sorry.
Well...

50:04.143 --> 50:04.936
Okay.

50:05.311 --> 50:06.604
So...?

50:07.438 --> 50:09.524
Can I chop a thing?

50:09.774 --> 50:11.776
Yes.

50:12.276 --> 50:14.570
- Cucumbers.
- Cu...

50:14.946 --> 50:16.030
- Cucumbers.
- Yeah.

50:16.447 --> 50:18.783
Okay.

50:24.455 --> 50:25.915
atmospheric music

50:38.136 --> 50:38.886
Hey.

50:39.345 --> 50:42.306
I'll be right back, okay?

50:55.194 --> 50:56.988
Oh, my gosh.

50:57.363 --> 50:58.489
Oh, shit.

50:58.781 --> 50:59.490
Is she okay?

50:59.824 --> 51:01.325
Not really, no.

51:02.201 --> 51:03.911
We followed a trail of blood
and found her passed out.

51:04.495 --> 51:06.414
She was right where the hunter's
plane used to be.

51:06.706 --> 51:07.665
Are you hurt?

51:08.207 --> 51:09.083
- Let's get her jacket off.
- It's okay.

51:09.625 --> 51:10.084
We got you, we got you.

51:10.501 --> 51:11.210
Get her back here.

51:11.669 --> 51:13.713
We can get her to the tub.

51:14.172 --> 51:14.922
Okay, yeah, let's get her up.

51:15.339 --> 51:15.923
Okay, come on, let's go.

51:16.340 --> 51:17.049
One, two, three.

51:17.466 --> 51:18.718
Up. Up. Come on.

51:20.178 --> 51:22.096
Okay, I got you.

51:22.555 --> 51:24.056
Okay.

51:24.682 --> 51:26.976
It's gonna get better. Come on.

51:27.560 --> 51:28.686
Come on.

51:28.853 --> 51:30.771
Yeah.

51:31.230 --> 51:33.482
Come on. Come on.

51:40.531 --> 51:43.743
Just... let them have a minute.

51:59.926 --> 52:02.261
This is all my fault.

52:04.388 --> 52:06.265
I'm really sorry.

52:08.392 --> 52:10.811
Good game.

52:11.229 --> 52:12.063
You fucking loser.

52:14.023 --> 52:15.566
You're talking shit?

52:15.900 --> 52:17.068
You little bitch.

52:17.610 --> 52:20.238
You ended up with nil,
the same as me.

52:22.281 --> 52:24.283
I'm fine.

52:26.285 --> 52:27.954
Good game.

52:40.633 --> 52:42.343
suspenseful music

53:23.009 --> 53:24.719
intriguing music

54:37.208 --> 54:39.710
Can this...

54:40.044 --> 54:42.755
just be enough...

54:45.216 --> 54:46.842
...please?

54:48.844 --> 54:51.055
Well, I think we've looked
at every tree

54:51.514 --> 54:52.264
within a mile of here.

54:52.890 --> 54:54.767
So we should go back.
It's getting dark.

54:55.226 --> 54:56.519
No, it's fine. Let's just...

54:57.061 --> 54:59.230
make sure we didn't
miss anything.

54:59.563 --> 55:01.065
Yeah.

55:02.900 --> 55:04.402
Huh.

55:05.903 --> 55:07.571
That's weird.

55:15.413 --> 55:17.081
Why is it melted?

55:19.208 --> 55:20.960
ominous music

55:34.098 --> 55:35.099
Van!

55:35.558 --> 55:37.143
intense music

55:39.979 --> 55:41.981
Where the fuck did he come from?

55:48.988 --> 55:50.865
Hey, hey. Stop!

55:51.323 --> 55:52.324
We're not trying to hurt you!

55:52.825 --> 55:54.827
Ow! Hey! Stop fighting. It's us.

55:59.582 --> 56:01.083
intriguing music

56:41.999 --> 56:44.752
No, that's impossible.

56:44.877 --> 56:46.045
Shit.

56:46.504 --> 56:47.338
Oh, my gosh.

56:47.671 --> 56:49.298
Javi.

56:51.175 --> 56:53.719
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

56:54.011 --> 56:55.346
Oh, my gosh.

56:55.888 --> 56:58.891
How... How the hell
are you alive?

57:02.228 --> 57:04.688
eerie music

57:04.980 --> 57:06.815
Javi. Hey.

57:07.024 --> 57:08.275
It's me.

57:08.692 --> 57:10.194
It's your brother.

57:14.323 --> 57:15.741
This means Lottie was right.

57:16.534 --> 57:18.327
She's the one who said
Javi was alive.

57:18.911 --> 57:22.831
Three cheers for Lottie!
Hip-hip...

57:23.707 --> 57:27.711
Lottie knew he was alive,
but Taissa knew where he was.

57:28.045 --> 57:29.255
No, but I...

57:29.880 --> 57:33.551
No, you can't deny this anymore.
There is something

57:34.260 --> 57:38.931
deep inside of you that
is connected to all of this.

58:25.728 --> 58:27.104
You got to let me know
what you think about those.

58:27.646 --> 58:28.480
If you can get
the machine working.

58:28.897 --> 58:29.523
Okay, will do.

58:30.065 --> 58:31.859
Report back. Yeah.

58:36.822 --> 58:39.199
haunting, ethereal music

58:46.999 --> 58:49.001
Tai...?

58:50.127 --> 58:52.630
Hey, Van.
