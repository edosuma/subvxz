WEBVTT

00:21.313 --> 00:23.273
-All right.
-Okay. Hello.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.692
Stand by. We got speed.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.069
-You ready?
-Yeah.

00:27.152 --> 00:29.446
Now here's a little story
That I got to tell

00:29.530 --> 00:32.323
About three bad brothers
That you know so well

00:32.406 --> 00:34.910
It started way back in history

00:34.993 --> 00:36.411
-With Ad-Rock
-MCA

00:36.495 --> 00:37.579
-And me
-Mike D

00:52.261 --> 00:53.595
Who's your favorite Beastie Boy?

00:53.679 --> 00:55.806
I sort of identify
with bits of all of them really.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.642
I guess MCA resonates.

00:58.725 --> 00:59.643
Mike D.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.728
Ad-Rock is, like, big inspiration.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.230
When you listen to a group for that long,

01:03.313 --> 01:06.316
you go through phases
of who you feel you're more connected to

01:06.400 --> 01:07.651
at certain times in your life.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.027
My favorite is Mike D.

01:09.111 --> 01:11.864
He's really funny,
but in, like, a subtle way.

01:11.947 --> 01:14.366
Do you have a favorite Beasties video
over the years?

01:14.449 --> 01:18.120
Mine's actually an exercise video
that never came out.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.873
Call the number on your screen right now!

01:20.956 --> 01:23.876
MCA, I feel like, was the leader
of all of them. Kept them all together.

01:23.959 --> 01:25.752
He's the one that comes up
with all the crazy stuff.

01:25.836 --> 01:28.130
MCA definitely played a large part
in the world.

01:28.213 --> 01:30.215
Very influential man, a big heart.

01:30.299 --> 01:33.218
I always thought that Ad-Rock
kind of encapsulated the coolness.

01:33.302 --> 01:36.763
It's a word that is not really used
that much in these days,

01:36.847 --> 01:39.933
but I think it really suits me,
as well as these guys.

01:40.017 --> 01:41.018
It's "macho."

01:41.101 --> 01:42.644
It's a macho that we have.

01:42.728 --> 01:45.647
Because he's so honest.
He's, like, brutally honest.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.357
We're not very talented musically,

01:47.441 --> 01:49.568
so we figured we'd try all kinds
of different realms.

01:49.651 --> 01:50.527
Yauch.

01:51.028 --> 01:53.322
Yo, I'd just like to say, "What's up?"
to my grandma.

01:53.405 --> 01:56.116
Because it's all about the bass guitar
for me.

02:01.914 --> 02:05.250
Yo, hold up, wait up,
just sit down for a minute.

02:05.334 --> 02:06.668
It's not over yet.

02:07.419 --> 02:08.419
Go!

02:15.844 --> 02:17.846
Their music has just been so influential.

02:17.930 --> 02:20.015
The soundtrack of my life,
if you can call it that.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.184
It's the soundtrack of our lives.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.019
A lot of bands, they just break apart,

02:24.102 --> 02:26.688
and then they come back at the end.

02:26.772 --> 02:29.525
But they stayed together
the whole adventure.

02:29.608 --> 02:33.362
I can't stand it
I know you planned it

02:33.445 --> 02:35.572
I'mma set it straight, this Watergate

02:35.656 --> 02:38.700
I can't stand rockin' when I'm in here

02:38.784 --> 02:41.703
'Cause your crystal ball
Ain't so crystal clear

02:41.787 --> 02:44.998
So while you sit back and wonder why

02:45.082 --> 02:47.501
I got this fuckin' thorn in my side

02:47.584 --> 02:50.587
Oh, my God, it's a mirage

02:50.671 --> 02:53.465
I'm tellin' y'all, it's sabotage

02:55.884 --> 02:56.885
Yeah!

02:58.428 --> 02:59.721
All right.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.310
Yo!

03:07.729 --> 03:08.730
What's up?

03:09.398 --> 03:10.858
Brooklyn!

03:17.781 --> 03:19.449
Well, hi.

03:21.994 --> 03:22.995
Well...

03:23.871 --> 03:25.539
Hello, everyone.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.044
-Well, hi, everyone. I'm Adam.
-Hi, Adam.

03:31.128 --> 03:32.129
And I'm Mike.

03:32.212 --> 03:36.383
Also known as Michael Diamond or Mike D.

03:36.842 --> 03:39.094
And we're Beastie Boys from New York City.

03:43.182 --> 03:46.768
Now, tonight we're going
to tell you the story of three kids

03:46.852 --> 03:48.520
that met and became friends

03:48.604 --> 03:52.191
and did all kinds of crazy stuff
together for over 30 years.

03:52.983 --> 03:57.070
The two of us will do the best we can,
because one of us isn't here.

03:57.696 --> 03:58.780
Adam Yauch...

04:02.367 --> 04:04.828
who you also know as MCA.

04:05.871 --> 04:08.373
We lost him in 2012 to cancer.

04:08.457 --> 04:11.376
And when Adam died,
we stopped being a band.

04:12.127 --> 04:15.255
Yeah, it just felt too weird
to do the band without Yauch,

04:15.339 --> 04:19.218
because, well, I mean,
the band was his idea in the first place.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.138
So, although Yauch's not here with us,

04:23.805 --> 04:26.892
"What would Yauch do?"
is always on our minds.

04:27.643 --> 04:30.812
But trying to imagine what
Yauch would actually do is pretty hard,

04:30.896 --> 04:32.940
'cause he was very unpredictable.

04:33.023 --> 04:36.026
He was a wild card,
but we'll get to that later.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.653
The Beastie Boys have arrived.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.821
Always on the cutting edge of fashion.

04:39.905 --> 04:44.117
When they're not on the red carpet,
they are always at the shows in Paris.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.911
Look at the white dreads.

04:45.994 --> 04:49.790
The Beastie Boys are back
after a six-year absence.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.667
Guys, that's a long time.

04:51.750 --> 04:54.169
What have you been up to?
It's great to see you.

04:54.253 --> 04:56.255
-Hey!
-Actually, I know it sounds kinda funny,

04:56.338 --> 04:59.424
but we were actually
captured by Sasquatch.

05:00.092 --> 05:03.136
What we're gonna do right here
is go back.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.764
Way back. Back into time.

05:14.356 --> 05:20.112
Being a weird kid from, sorry, Mom,
a weird family, is just kind of weird.

05:20.195 --> 05:21.780
But it's also pretty lonely.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.907
One day, I heard this band The Clash.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.750
Not only did I love their music,

05:33.834 --> 05:37.546
but when I heard it,
I knew there'd be other weirdos out there.

05:37.629 --> 05:38.964
I just had to find them.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.176
I found my first other weirdo at school.

05:42.259 --> 05:44.303
His name is John Berry.

05:44.720 --> 05:48.891
One afternoon, we saw an ad in the back of
this free paper called The Village Voice.

05:48.974 --> 05:51.977
It was for a band that we loved
called the Bad Brains.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.732
And the Bad Brains were playing this show

05:56.815 --> 05:58.942
down at this place called
the Botany Talk House.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.823
So we go down to the club

06:04.907 --> 06:09.286
and there's, like, maybe all of 15 people
in the entire place,

06:09.369 --> 06:11.205
and they're all grown-ups.

06:11.288 --> 06:14.499
But there was one other kid our age there.

06:14.583 --> 06:15.667
And he looked really cool.

06:15.751 --> 06:18.795
He had this long trench coat on
from, like, a thrift store,

06:18.879 --> 06:20.047
he had combat boots,

06:20.130 --> 06:23.258
he had these homemade buttons
on his trench coat,

06:23.342 --> 06:25.886
and his name was Adam Yauch.

06:28.305 --> 06:33.519
So I met Yauch and Mike and John Berry
at a Misfits show in 1982.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.396
It might have been Circle Jerks,

06:36.480 --> 06:39.816
but I like the Misfits more, so I'm gonna
say that it was at a Misfits show.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.277
Now, somehow, me and my two friends heard

06:42.361 --> 06:45.113
that there were a bunch of kids
hanging out in a ladies' bathroom.

06:45.447 --> 06:46.990
So we walked in there

06:47.074 --> 06:52.538
and we found a bunch of super cool-looking
punk kids our age hanging out.

06:52.621 --> 06:55.332
And I actually recognized one of them,
Jill Cunniff,

06:55.415 --> 06:57.376
'cause we were
in fifth grade class together.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.169
And so she was my in.

06:59.253 --> 07:02.214
I also recognized one of the other kids
in the group,

07:02.297 --> 07:03.340
Kate Schellenbach,

07:03.423 --> 07:05.425
'cause we grew up
in the same neighborhood.

07:08.637 --> 07:10.681
Kate was just-- She was really cool.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.432
She was also smarter than we were.

07:12.516 --> 07:16.979
And she was into, I don't know, more
sophisticated, European kind of music--

07:17.062 --> 07:20.148
Just-- Sorry to interrupt, but just to say
that she was smarter than us--

07:20.232 --> 07:22.192
-I mean, Kate's very smart, but--
-Sure, it didn't take a lot.

07:22.276 --> 07:24.069
-Not that it's saying that much. Okay.
-But she was.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.153
-Fact.
-Correct.

07:26.488 --> 07:30.200
So, she was into cool bands
like Kraftwerk.

07:30.284 --> 07:33.704
And she lived in this loft on 14th Street
with her mom

07:33.787 --> 07:36.206
that was this big open old-style loft,

07:36.290 --> 07:39.251
and in the center of all of it
was her drum set.

07:41.962 --> 07:45.382
My first punk rock friend
was Dave Scilken. And he--

07:45.465 --> 07:47.885
That's him on the left.
And that's me on the right.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.845
So me and my best friend
in junior high school,

07:49.928 --> 07:51.763
we're playing basketball
outside of school,

07:51.847 --> 07:54.641
and we see this crazy-looking kid
with spiked hair and a trench coat

07:54.725 --> 07:57.436
walking down the street,
carrying a synthesizer.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.980
So we had to go over to talk to this kid.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.149
He was younger than us.

08:02.232 --> 08:05.194
He was in the sixth grade,
and he was cutting school.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.655
Now, let that sink in.

08:10.282 --> 08:12.951
You're 11 years old in the sixth grade.

08:14.411 --> 08:18.165
At that time, our main hangout
was at John Berry's apartment

08:18.248 --> 08:19.541
on 100th and Broadway.

08:19.625 --> 08:21.543
And that's where we'd play music.

08:21.627 --> 08:26.048
In the early '80s, everyone in our scene
was in some kind of band.

08:26.131 --> 08:29.760
And Yauch kept pushing us
to start a band with him.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.595
Now he already had a name for it:

08:32.135 --> 08:33.263
Beastie Boys.

08:36.475 --> 08:42.438
The band originally
was me, Kate, Adam Yauch, John Berry.

08:42.523 --> 08:43.899
The name stood for

08:43.982 --> 08:48.612
Boys Entering Anarchistic States
Towards Inner Excellence.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.367
The acronym alone makes no sense

08:53.450 --> 08:56.119
because "boys" is already
in the title of the band.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.580
So the name is ridiculous and redundant.

08:58.664 --> 09:01.875
And inaccurate,
because there was a girl drummer, Kate.

09:02.709 --> 09:06.004
So, our very first gig
was at John Berry's house,

09:06.088 --> 09:08.173
up where he lived, on the third floor.

09:09.341 --> 09:11.343
Yauch was turning 17.

09:11.426 --> 09:12.886
And Yauch's like, "You know what,

09:12.970 --> 09:15.472
I'm gonna have a party,
and we're gonna play at it."

09:20.394 --> 09:25.482
And then, when we go up to play,
somehow I got nominated to be the singer.

09:25.566 --> 09:29.194
Now, I was a super shy type of kid.

09:29.278 --> 09:31.029
I don't know why I ever agreed to this.

09:37.035 --> 09:40.372
I guess the main thing I remember is
probably, like, 10 or 12 kids in a room

09:40.455 --> 09:44.459
maybe 12 feet wide by 20 feet long
or something, just kind of, like,

09:44.543 --> 09:46.336
jumping up and down
and bumping into each other.

09:46.420 --> 09:49.548
But it was all basically, like,
friends having a good time.

09:53.886 --> 09:55.929
I wasn't in Beastie Boys back then.

09:56.013 --> 09:57.764
But I joined in 1983.

09:57.848 --> 10:00.475
John Berry wasn't into it anymore,
and so he quit.

10:01.435 --> 10:04.730
At that point, I was hanging out with
Mike and Yauch and Kate all the time.

10:04.813 --> 10:07.983
I guess since I was standing there,
I'm the new guitar player.

10:17.659 --> 10:20.329
We were a hardcore band,
but we kind of weren't.

10:20.412 --> 10:25.834
I mean, we were like Monty Python
as much as we were Black Flag.

10:28.462 --> 10:29.463
Introduce yourself.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.840
Yeah, yeah. So I'm Michael.
I'm in the Beastie Boys.

10:31.924 --> 10:35.427
My name is Kate. I'm a Capricorn,
and I have lint in my pocket.

10:35.511 --> 10:37.888
Now we're gonna get to an older,
more mature member.

10:37.971 --> 10:41.517
-Give us your name.
-My name's Ad, but you can call me Adam.

10:41.600 --> 10:45.854
And I'm just hanging out here on TV.
You know, your basic stuff.

10:45.938 --> 10:48.857
My name's Adam, as it says on my belt.

10:48.941 --> 10:50.943
Get a shot of Adam's belt if you can.

10:51.026 --> 10:53.320
How old are you? About 13, 14?

10:53.403 --> 10:55.030
-About.
-Yeah. Twelve, eleven.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.157
So, we're getting a little older now.

10:57.241 --> 10:58.951
We're no longer 15.

10:59.034 --> 11:00.118
We're 16.

11:01.078 --> 11:02.788
We were into all kinds of music.

11:02.871 --> 11:06.500
We listened to soul and punk
and rap and reggae.

11:06.583 --> 11:09.294
Rap was hard to find back then
'cause there was only a few 12-inches out.

11:09.378 --> 11:11.588
But we wanted to switch up our style.

11:11.672 --> 11:13.924
So we were obsessed
with this stupid commercial

11:14.007 --> 11:16.176
for this ice-cream store called Carvel.

11:16.260 --> 11:20.138
Hello, I'm a Carvel celestial person
from outer space.

11:20.222 --> 11:21.890
My real name is Cookie Puss.

11:21.974 --> 11:23.559
And someone had the smart idea

11:23.642 --> 11:26.979
to record a super stupid
prank phone call song called

11:27.062 --> 11:28.230
"Cooky Puss."

11:35.070 --> 11:37.531
-Hello, Carvel.
-Yo, man. Cookie Puss there?

11:37.614 --> 11:38.615
Who?

11:39.783 --> 11:41.660
Cookie Puss.
I wanna speak to Cookie Puss, man.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.287
No. Nobody here by that name.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.330
Cookie O'Puss then. Cookie Chick...

11:45.414 --> 11:47.040
So, this guy Dave Parsons,

11:47.124 --> 11:50.294
he had this record store downtown
called the Rat Cage.

11:50.377 --> 11:54.089
We would cut school
to go hang out at this place, right?

11:54.173 --> 11:56.884
By this time,
Dave started a small record label.

11:56.967 --> 11:59.678
Put "Cooky Puss" out as a 12-inch, right.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.890
And then something happened
that we never thought would happen.

12:02.973 --> 12:06.268
DJs started playing our record in clubs.

12:06.351 --> 12:11.023
Then other people besides our 15 friends
actually heard our music.

12:11.106 --> 12:15.319
And one day, I went to visit a friend at
some weird high school temp job she had.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.738
And we heard that DJ Afrika Bambaataa

12:17.821 --> 12:20.991
was on a talk show or something
on some other floor in the building.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.492
And we got fuckin' psyched.

12:22.576 --> 12:25.829
And we ran down
and we snuck onto the TV set.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.748
And this is what happened next.

12:28.207 --> 12:29.958
I was wondering--
There's a song I really like

12:30.042 --> 12:32.878
called "Cooky Puss" by the Beastie Boys.
I was wondering if you ever heard of it.

12:32.961 --> 12:34.505
Yes, I heard of "Cooky Puss."

12:34.588 --> 12:38.592
I've gotten the record
through the rock pool. It's tough.

12:38.675 --> 12:39.676
Okay.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.470
Yeah, you like that--
Why do you like that one?

12:41.553 --> 12:43.931
Yeah, it's just a really funny song.
I heard it on the radio--

12:44.014 --> 12:47.809
It's got scratching and work on it?
Like that?

12:47.893 --> 12:49.728
It has a little bit of scratching on it.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.396
It's funky.

12:53.649 --> 12:54.942
Chapter 2:

12:55.025 --> 12:58.195
"All We Do Is Listen to Rap."

13:01.114 --> 13:03.784
In 1984, a song came out

13:03.867 --> 13:07.371
that would change the course
of our band forever.

13:07.454 --> 13:10.207
"Sucker MC's" by Run-DMC.

13:10.832 --> 13:15.337
Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes

13:15.420 --> 13:17.881
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say

13:17.965 --> 13:20.926
The rhyme was def
A-then it went this way

13:21.009 --> 13:24.555
"Sucker MC's" was everywhere in New York
when it came out.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.557
You heard it coming out of cars,

13:26.640 --> 13:29.643
out of tape decks, out of pizza spots,
all over the city.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.854
Run-DMC was the shit.

13:31.937 --> 13:33.522
And we wanted to be just like them.

13:33.605 --> 13:36.233
I mean,
we studied every song, every lyric.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.902
We were lookin' at every picture,
tryin' to figure out their sneaks,

13:38.986 --> 13:40.487
their clothes, everything.

13:40.571 --> 13:44.783
We would study and repeat
all our favorite rap songs all day.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.536
Not that we felt we would ever be
a rap group or anything.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.997
But around this time,
we started writing our own rhymes.

13:50.080 --> 13:52.583
I think now we're gonna show
a little example

13:53.083 --> 13:56.128
that shows kind of where we were at
on the mic as MCs.

13:56.211 --> 13:59.131
Wait, we're not there yet.
You're jumping ahead there. Go back.

13:59.214 --> 14:01.216
-Am I jumping the gun?
-Turn around, Spike.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.802
-Really? Okay.
-All right. Time out.

14:03.886 --> 14:04.887
See, Spike?

14:04.970 --> 14:07.306
-We're definitely in the wrong place.
-The teleprompter...

14:11.476 --> 14:12.936
-All right. That's what I thought--
-Okay.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.771
-Here we go.
-Hey, hey, hey.

14:14.855 --> 14:19.318
We're back. We really-- We rehearsed this.
We practiced this, like, for real.

14:19.401 --> 14:21.987
I'm sorry. I fucked up the teleprompter.
Sorry about that.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.072
Teleprompter? I didn't even notice.

14:30.746 --> 14:31.747
Anyways.

14:32.748 --> 14:35.626
That's a good transition, you guys.
"Anyways."

14:36.376 --> 14:40.297
Around this time, we had this big show
coming up at Studio 54, right.

14:40.380 --> 14:44.051
Wait. The Studio 54.
You know, with, like, Brooke Shields.

14:44.134 --> 14:48.555
Okay. With, like, Baryshnikov,
Halston, Donna Summer.

14:49.139 --> 14:51.350
I didn't know if that was, like,
a call and response thing.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.810
-Yeah, no one really chimed in.
-I don't know. Anyway.

14:53.894 --> 14:58.190
Footnote about our show at Studio 54,
it was a Battle of the Bands and we lost.

14:58.273 --> 15:00.776
So, we had this show
coming up at Studio 54,

15:00.859 --> 15:02.819
and we wanted to play our song
"Cooky Puss."

15:02.903 --> 15:04.905
Now we never did it live before,
but we thought--

15:04.988 --> 15:07.366
We had this idea
to have a DJ do it with us.

15:07.991 --> 15:11.662
Our friend told us that he knew
about this NYU college kid that could DJ

15:11.745 --> 15:14.957
and wanted to be a rap producer
and had all this DJ equipment and stuff.

15:15.040 --> 15:18.544
But more important,
he had a bubble machine.

15:18.627 --> 15:21.880
Wait. Say what, Ad-Rock?
A bubble machine?

15:21.964 --> 15:24.800
Yo, homes. That's right, Mike D.
He had a bubble machine.

15:24.883 --> 15:25.884
Okay.

15:25.968 --> 15:29.137
So we went over to this guy's dorm room
to meet him.

15:29.221 --> 15:33.141
But when we get there, the door's opened
by this long-haired heavy metal guy

15:33.225 --> 15:36.562
with these weird leather zip-up gloves,
which totally freaked us out.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.939
This couldn't possibly be him.

15:39.022 --> 15:43.110
Now, he opens the door
to this teeny dorm room, right.

15:43.193 --> 15:46.029
And it's filled with, like, a huge PA

15:46.113 --> 15:48.949
and there's turntables
and all these drum machines.

15:49.032 --> 15:52.494
And yes, ladies and gentlemen,
a bubble machine.

15:53.495 --> 15:54.705
So what do we do?

15:54.788 --> 15:56.623
We hired him on the spot.

15:56.707 --> 15:58.375
And this is Rick Rubin.

16:03.547 --> 16:07.092
Now, at first, it seemed like
a weird fit with us and Rick Rubin.

16:07.176 --> 16:10.179
I mean, he's from Long Island
and we're from New York City.

16:10.262 --> 16:14.850
And also, Rick was into a bunch
of other stuff that we weren't into.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.685
Like wrestling and heavy metal.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.896
And we thought that shit
was kind of goofy.

16:18.979 --> 16:21.064
Rick seemed way older than us and--

16:23.817 --> 16:24.651
Well--

16:24.735 --> 16:26.403
We gotta work on the timing of that photo.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.571
-I mean--
-With the--

16:29.072 --> 16:31.909
Do we comment on the cable box or no?
I mean--

16:31.992 --> 16:34.536
-Everyone's thinking about it, yeah?
-Right.

16:34.620 --> 16:37.623
That was some high-tech shit for the time.

16:37.706 --> 16:41.668
They got the cable box,
the multi-line telephone. I mean--

16:42.711 --> 16:45.422
I mean, why can't it be like the old days,
with a pack of Salems

16:45.506 --> 16:47.799
and a fucking filled ashtray
next to your bed?

16:47.883 --> 16:48.884
I mean, right?

16:52.054 --> 16:55.641
Rick seemed way older than us,
and he seemed kind of more mature than us.

16:55.724 --> 16:57.809
And he had money to pay for things.

16:57.893 --> 17:00.145
But most of all, it was his confidence.

17:00.229 --> 17:02.439
Whatever he was into
was the thing to be into.

17:02.523 --> 17:04.107
And that could be infectious.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.193
You couldn't hang out with Rick

17:06.276 --> 17:09.069
and not be excited about
what he was excited about.

17:09.154 --> 17:10.570
So we kinda got into wrestling.

17:11.281 --> 17:12.324
Kinda.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.827
-And we definitely got into heavy metal.
-Definitely.

17:17.204 --> 17:19.079
-Definitely.
-Definitely.

17:19.915 --> 17:21.915
It only took a week for us
to go from thinking

17:22.000 --> 17:24.586
that the guy
with those zip-up gloves was goofy

17:24.670 --> 17:26.880
to thinking, "He's the coolest dude."

17:26.964 --> 17:28.799
He became part of our full-time crew.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.928
He kinda became, like,
this weird, cool older brother.

17:33.011 --> 17:35.097
And his dorm room
became our new headquarters.

17:35.180 --> 17:36.765
Like, our new Rat Cage.

17:36.849 --> 17:40.477
And every day, instead of going to school,
we'd go to Rick's dorm room to hang out.

17:40.561 --> 17:43.230
And we'd listen to records.
And then we'd go out to some club.

17:43.313 --> 17:45.566
And then we'd go to
Cozy Soup 'n' Burger to eat.

17:45.649 --> 17:48.068
And then we'd talk all about the night
and the music

17:48.151 --> 17:50.863
and all the music
we were gonna make together one day.

17:50.946 --> 17:53.782
After the Studio 54 show, we had a DJ.

17:53.866 --> 17:57.703
So we're like, "Fuck it. Let's try
to rap and do that as part of our show."

17:59.788 --> 18:03.250
So Rick joined our band
and became DJ Double R, of course.

18:03.333 --> 18:06.837
Our first shows with Rick,
we'd do, like, half as a hardcore band,

18:06.920 --> 18:10.549
and then we'd leave the stage
and we'd do the other half as a rap group.

18:10.632 --> 18:12.593
-B-E-A
-S-T-I-E

18:12.676 --> 18:15.012
We're the Beastie four
Rock shockin' the scene

18:15.095 --> 18:17.347
-I'm Master Adam Yauch
-And Slop the Rock

18:17.431 --> 18:19.600
-With Mike D
-Katie Schellenbach

18:19.683 --> 18:22.019
Now hip-hop, just don't stop

18:22.102 --> 18:24.146
You rock to the beat
Till it makes you drop

18:24.229 --> 18:27.065
Okay, okay. I think, you know--

18:28.317 --> 18:29.401
You get the--

18:31.403 --> 18:32.529
You get the idea.

18:32.613 --> 18:36.366
Most rappers hold their rhymes
in little pieces of paper, right?

18:36.867 --> 18:38.118
Isn't that a thing?

18:38.202 --> 18:39.953
It's one thing to hang out
with your friends

18:40.037 --> 18:42.122
and rap "Sucker MC's" all day long.

18:42.206 --> 18:46.460
But being on stage with an audience
and rapping our own rhymes,

18:46.543 --> 18:47.836
well, that was different.

18:47.920 --> 18:50.297
Now we didn't realize it,
but as time went on,

18:50.380 --> 18:54.510
the more we were hanging out with Rick
and starting to act like Rick,

18:54.593 --> 18:56.845
the less we were hanging out with Kate.

18:56.929 --> 19:00.390
And maybe even more so,
the less Kate was hanging out with us.

19:00.474 --> 19:02.893
I think our friends were very confused

19:02.976 --> 19:05.062
as why we were hanging out with Rick
all the time.

19:10.359 --> 19:12.653
Well, you know, a band's gotta eat.

19:15.656 --> 19:20.619
So around this time, Rick was producing
his first real rap song, "It's Yours,"

19:20.702 --> 19:22.496
for a rapper named T La Rock.

19:24.998 --> 19:29.127
Up until then, music for rap records
was mostly played by a band.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.880
It was played to sound, like,
funky and smoothed out

19:31.964 --> 19:33.465
so it would get on the radio.

19:33.549 --> 19:36.426
But "It's Yours" was just a rapper
and a drum machine.

19:36.510 --> 19:39.096
It was raw and punk in sound.

19:39.179 --> 19:40.347
So one night,

19:40.430 --> 19:45.602
Rick told us that he's gonna go meet
this guy, Russell Simmons, at Danceteria.

19:45.686 --> 19:48.647
We didn't know what Rick and Russell
were meeting about,

19:48.730 --> 19:52.067
but we are just psyched
to spy on them talking at the bar.

19:52.150 --> 19:55.612
'Cause this Russell guy
was not only Run-DMC's manager,

19:55.696 --> 19:58.282
but he was also DJ Run's brother.

19:58.365 --> 19:59.950
It wasn't like he was some guy that, like,

20:00.033 --> 20:02.828
knew some guy
that knew somebody connected to rap.

20:02.911 --> 20:04.246
Russell was rap.

20:04.329 --> 20:06.748
He was at the center
of the business of rap.

20:06.832 --> 20:09.126
Now when Russell left,
we were so psyched.

20:09.209 --> 20:11.086
We ran over to Rick and we were like,

20:11.170 --> 20:14.548
"Yo, yo, yo, yo, Rick.
You gotta tell us, like, everything.

20:14.631 --> 20:16.508
What did this Russell guy say to you?

20:16.592 --> 20:19.094
You gotta tell us
everything you guys talked about."

20:21.346 --> 20:23.098
Well, I mean, that's-- We were excited.

20:23.182 --> 20:24.141
That's pretty good.

20:24.224 --> 20:27.311
And that's what we sounded like
when we were, like, 16.

20:27.394 --> 20:30.022
So Rick told us
that Russell couldn't believe

20:30.105 --> 20:33.275
that not only "It's Yours" was made
by someone he'd never heard of,

20:33.358 --> 20:34.902
but it was made by a white guy.

20:34.985 --> 20:36.570
And Rick said that they hit it off

20:36.653 --> 20:39.990
and they hatched a plan
to start a record label, Def Jam.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.200
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

20:41.283 --> 20:44.578
Pay attention, hang up the phone
and watch this.

20:44.661 --> 20:45.996
Jam means record.

20:46.079 --> 20:48.332
Def is short for definitive.

20:48.415 --> 20:51.126
Definitely the best records
you could buy today.

20:51.210 --> 20:54.213
So def, so def, so def
It's a def jam

20:54.296 --> 20:58.008
And somewhere in those plans,
Rick told Russell about us.

20:58.759 --> 21:01.094
"Hey, I got these three white rappers.

21:01.178 --> 21:02.971
They're still in high school.

21:03.055 --> 21:06.808
I mean, they're punk rock,
but they love hip-hop even more.

21:06.892 --> 21:09.645
I mean, all they do is listen to rap."

21:16.860 --> 21:21.240
Russell Simmons immediately saw the
possibility in managing a white rap group.

21:21.323 --> 21:24.034
And within days,
we went to his office to meet with him.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.578
We think he's gonna have
this huge fancy office,

21:26.662 --> 21:30.499
but we go up there,
it's just, in reality, two small rooms.

21:30.582 --> 21:32.292
But what's kinda cool is,

21:32.376 --> 21:38.215
in one of the rooms there's fucking
Kurtis Blow, the King of Rap, right?

21:39.049 --> 21:43.804
And he's in Russell's office
trying to learn to break-dance.

21:43.887 --> 21:46.765
He's trying to spin on his head
for some reason.

21:46.849 --> 21:48.684
And not only that, I don't know if--

21:48.767 --> 21:51.270
Does anybody in here know
this crew Full Force?

21:52.563 --> 21:56.692
Well, he's surrounded-- He's surrounded
by the dudes in Full Force,

21:56.775 --> 22:00.070
who are watching him learn to break-dance.

22:00.153 --> 22:03.490
I mean, it was a crazy fuckin' scene,
is what we're trying to tell you guys.

22:04.825 --> 22:06.368
So when it came to confidence,

22:06.451 --> 22:09.204
Russell was even more next-level
than Rick.

22:09.746 --> 22:10.914
If you were in his orbit,

22:10.998 --> 22:15.002
you couldn't help but believe all the
awesome shit he said was gonna happen.

22:15.085 --> 22:17.963
In 1984, no one cared about rap music.

22:18.046 --> 22:19.590
I mean, it was barely on the radio.

22:19.673 --> 22:23.218
But everywhere Russell went
he'd be selling to everybody.

22:23.302 --> 22:26.805
"Run-DMC is gonna be the biggest artist
of our generation."

22:28.348 --> 22:31.643
"Rick Rubin. He's gonna be
the Phil Spector of rap.

22:32.853 --> 22:34.062
Beastie Boys?

22:34.146 --> 22:38.150
They're white B-boys and they're gonna be
the biggest group in the world."

22:39.568 --> 22:40.569
All right.

22:41.737 --> 22:43.405
Let's slow things down for a minute.

22:43.488 --> 22:45.407
We had just started rapping.

22:45.490 --> 22:47.784
I mean, we were mediocre at best.

22:47.868 --> 22:50.954
But Rick and Russell believed in us,
and that gave us confidence.

22:53.749 --> 22:58.170
And so they hooked it up for us
to go record our first rap song.

22:58.253 --> 22:59.671
It's called "Rock Hard."

23:02.049 --> 23:04.426
I don't know. It's not our finest moment
on the mic, okay.

23:04.510 --> 23:08.805
But you gotta understand, we love rap
music and we wanted to be rappers so bad.

23:08.889 --> 23:11.099
We wanted to be Run-DMC so bad.

23:11.183 --> 23:13.685
"First white B-boys, we don't regret.

23:13.769 --> 23:16.021
There's nothing wrong with your TV set."

23:17.814 --> 23:19.274
Russell Simmons wrote that line.

23:19.358 --> 23:21.610
And he kept telling us we had to say it
'cause it was great

23:21.693 --> 23:24.363
and how B-boy it was and punk
and all this other stuff.

23:24.446 --> 23:26.532
He also really wanted us to say,

23:26.615 --> 23:29.409
"I can play the drums, I can play guitar.

23:29.493 --> 23:32.496
Not just B-boys, we're real rock stars."

23:32.579 --> 23:34.206
And we went along with it.

23:34.289 --> 23:36.917
I mean, you're the legit dude in rap, man.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.087
You got fucking Kurtis Blow popping
and locking in your office and shit.

23:40.170 --> 23:43.006
I mean, if you think saying that's
gonna be fresh, fly, wild and bold,

23:43.090 --> 23:45.634
well, all right.
Turn me up in the headphones.

23:45.717 --> 23:47.469
Mike D, Ad-Rock, and MCA

23:48.053 --> 23:50.347
Not before long I could hear you say

23:50.430 --> 23:52.933
In a way, these boys got juice

23:53.016 --> 23:55.686
They're goin' off
You know they love to get loose

23:55.769 --> 23:57.896
Get loose, get loose

23:57.980 --> 23:59.356
Poose

24:00.107 --> 24:04.319
Now I would love to blame Rick
and Russell for the quality of the song,

24:04.403 --> 24:06.446
but that's all us on the mic.

24:06.530 --> 24:09.700
We wrote and said the rest of the lyrics
on that song.

24:09.783 --> 24:13.829
They wanted us to be a cartoon rap version
of an '80s metal band,

24:13.912 --> 24:18.041
but instead with Adidas shell toes
and tracksuits and shit.

24:18.125 --> 24:20.127
And we were all in.

24:20.210 --> 24:21.461
-Hell, yes.
-Right?

24:22.588 --> 24:23.630
For real.

24:25.591 --> 24:30.429
But it was decided at some point
that we had to kick Kate out of the band

24:30.512 --> 24:33.849
because she didn't fit
into our new tough rapper guy identity.

24:33.932 --> 24:35.559
Now how fucked-up is that?

24:36.685 --> 24:39.980
When Beastie Boys began,
the majority of our friends were girls.

24:40.063 --> 24:41.940
Like, the coolest girls.

24:42.024 --> 24:44.693
And it's really embarrassing
to think that we let them down.

24:45.444 --> 24:48.906
I mean, shit, maybe Kate would've quit
the band eventually,

24:48.989 --> 24:50.949
but it's just shitty
the way it all went down.

24:51.033 --> 24:54.161
See, up until then our band
was just more of a joke, you know?

24:54.244 --> 24:55.954
Something to do 'cause it was fun.

24:56.038 --> 24:58.707
Our big goal was to make each other laugh.

24:58.790 --> 25:02.711
But now we're with these Rick and Russell
guys, and they got big plans for us.

25:02.794 --> 25:04.546
It's like,
if Rick was the cool older brother,

25:04.630 --> 25:06.840
then Russell was, like,
the crazy-ass uncle.

25:06.924 --> 25:10.302
And we started hanging out every night,
all the time together.

25:10.385 --> 25:13.305
Going out to clubs.
Drinking screwdrivers, brass monkeys.

25:13.388 --> 25:16.225
And it was like this fucked-up fun family.

25:16.308 --> 25:20.187
Now, when you're young and drunk
and Russell Simmons is telling you

25:20.270 --> 25:23.357
that you're gonna be
the biggest rap group of all time,

25:23.440 --> 25:27.277
well, I guess you hear it enough,
you just start to believe that shit.

25:27.361 --> 25:30.614
And then some crazy shit happened.

25:33.492 --> 25:34.618
Spike.

25:35.369 --> 25:38.997
I'm sorry. Sorry about that.
There's supposed to be a cue here where--

25:39.081 --> 25:41.458
It was actually a bad joke anyways.
Keep going.

25:42.334 --> 25:44.002
It's gonna happen
or it's not gonna happen?

25:44.086 --> 25:45.295
Not tonight.

25:45.379 --> 25:47.506
This is the last show.
When is it supposed to happen?

25:47.589 --> 25:49.132
We didn't load it into the machine.

25:49.216 --> 25:51.176
Maybe we'll get it
before the end of the night.

25:51.260 --> 25:52.719
I'll get it. I'll get it.

25:52.803 --> 25:55.055
Well, it's a voice that goes,
"Crazy shit."

25:55.138 --> 25:58.433
And there's, like, a whole animation.
My friend Max Tannone did the-- Anyway.

25:59.059 --> 26:02.104
Hey, did you guys know that we opened
for Madonna on her very first tour?

26:03.188 --> 26:05.482
Well, we did. And the story of
how we opened for Madonna--

26:05.566 --> 26:06.817
Crazy shit.

26:09.111 --> 26:10.445
I got it.

26:12.155 --> 26:13.282
At any rate.

26:13.740 --> 26:17.494
So one day Russell Simmons gets a call
from Madonna's manager, Freddy DeMann.

26:17.578 --> 26:20.539
He calls and asks if Run-DMC
would like to open for Madonna

26:20.622 --> 26:21.832
on her first ever tour.

26:21.915 --> 26:25.085
And Russell said,
"Yes, they get 20 grand a show."

26:25.169 --> 26:27.921
Madonna's manager said, "Thank you, no."

26:28.005 --> 26:31.175
Madonna's manager calls Russell Simmons
back a couple hours later and he's like,

26:31.258 --> 26:34.553
"Hey, Russell. Do the Fat Boys wanna open
for Madonna on tour?"

26:35.220 --> 26:39.558
And he said, "Aw, man. The Fat Boys
are busy. They just can't do it."

26:39.641 --> 26:41.852
Russell never managed the Fat Boys.

26:43.562 --> 26:44.813
"But," he said,

26:44.897 --> 26:47.858
"I got these guys Beastie Boys,
and they'll do it for 500 bucks."

26:47.941 --> 26:49.401
And the next thing you know,

26:49.484 --> 26:52.112
we're in Seattle, Washington
at the Four Seasons hotel,

26:52.196 --> 26:54.573
getting ready to open for Madonna on tour.

26:55.407 --> 26:56.783
Remember that?

27:00.204 --> 27:04.458
So, before the tour,
we came up with a brilliant plan.

27:04.541 --> 27:08.504
What could we do that would
make all these people remember us?

27:08.587 --> 27:12.883
It certainly wasn't gonna be
our microphone mastery at the time.

27:12.966 --> 27:18.514
I mean, our big idea was that we should be
as rude and as awful as possible on stage.

27:18.597 --> 27:23.894
Yo! You better look out,
Detroit, Philly, Cincy, LA!

27:23.977 --> 27:25.229
We're coming to your town!

27:25.312 --> 27:26.772
I mean, if we just went up there

27:26.855 --> 27:29.358
and we just played
the two songs that we knew,

27:29.441 --> 27:30.817
and that's all we had at the time,

27:30.901 --> 27:33.570
and we just said,
"Thank you, everybody. Good night,"

27:33.654 --> 27:34.696
who would care?

27:34.780 --> 27:37.157
Instead, we'd be memorable.

27:37.241 --> 27:39.910
Memorable fuckin' jerks.

27:39.993 --> 27:41.787
We're real rock stars.

27:41.870 --> 27:44.164
I mean, everyone's there to see Madonna,

27:44.248 --> 27:46.416
and they for sure
don't give a fuck about us.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.461
But this is where
Rick's wrestling thing would come in.

27:49.545 --> 27:51.964
He wanted us
to be those wrestling villains

27:52.047 --> 27:54.800
screaming into the camera
at the side of the ring, like this:

27:54.883 --> 27:58.178
The only reason that we haven't done
a video yet is because as soon as we do,

27:58.262 --> 28:01.014
they're gonna have to change it
from MTV to Beastie TV.

28:01.098 --> 28:04.142
'Cause that's all they're gonna show
all day long, all night long.

28:04.226 --> 28:08.480
"The Beastie Boys. One of the finest
groups in music today." Right there.

28:08.564 --> 28:10.524
I think I'm wasting my breath
a little bit.

28:10.607 --> 28:12.109
Maybe I'm talking over your head.

28:12.192 --> 28:13.360
I think the interview's over.

28:13.443 --> 28:14.653
-Thank you very much.
-Me too.

28:18.323 --> 28:19.324
And so--

28:22.202 --> 28:24.246
And so every night on the Madonna tour,

28:24.329 --> 28:27.332
I would go out, front and center,
and I would do a speech like this.

28:29.209 --> 28:31.003
I'm the King Ad-Rock.

28:31.086 --> 28:33.422
And I'm the fucking king
of the Kings Theatre.

28:33.505 --> 28:34.631
And we're the Beastie Boys,

28:34.715 --> 28:37.342
and we're here tonight
to crush all competition.

28:37.426 --> 28:40.846
After we leave tonight you can
burn this motherfuckin' place down.

28:40.929 --> 28:43.098
'Cause y'all motherfuckers ain't shit.

28:48.687 --> 28:53.025
Just keep in mind
that this is who Adam was cursing out.

29:04.745 --> 29:06.788
It was, like,
a love-hate relationship type thing.

29:06.872 --> 29:10.375
You know, we hated them, they hated us.
It was, like, love.

29:11.418 --> 29:14.796
So we come home from tour,
and the very first thing we do

29:14.880 --> 29:19.551
is we go up to everyone and anyone
that'll hear it, and we're like,

29:19.635 --> 29:22.888
"Yo, yo, yo.
We were on tour with Madonna."

29:22.971 --> 29:25.349
It was the fucking
most awesome thing ever.

29:25.432 --> 29:27.935
And now we get home and it's official.

29:28.018 --> 29:29.311
We're a rap group.

29:31.563 --> 29:33.023
Really?

29:33.106 --> 29:34.900
-High five?
-Yeah.

29:34.983 --> 29:36.985
Yeah, it's coming back, Adam.
It's coming back.

29:38.570 --> 29:42.866
One night, Russell gets us a gig
at this club called the Encore,

29:42.950 --> 29:46.370
opening up for Kurtis Blow,
the King of Rap.

29:46.453 --> 29:48.455
So we were both--
We look at each other and we're like,

29:48.539 --> 29:53.001
"Yo, we're opening up for Kurtis Blow?
That's def."

29:54.127 --> 29:56.255
-Now--
-That's a direct quote, by the way.

29:56.338 --> 29:57.881
-Just so you know.
-Yeah. It is.

29:57.965 --> 30:02.094
Now the Encore is an all-black rap crowd.

30:02.177 --> 30:04.888
And we're the only white guys
in this place, right.

30:04.972 --> 30:08.308
And somehow, we decide it's a good idea

30:08.392 --> 30:11.436
to go out there
in a limo dressed like this.

30:15.649 --> 30:17.109
What's so funny?

30:18.610 --> 30:21.154
Yes, those are do-rags on our heads.

30:21.238 --> 30:22.948
So...

30:24.825 --> 30:29.496
So when we got on stage at the Encore
to play our song "Rock Hard,"

30:29.580 --> 30:32.040
they turned on all the lights, right,
in the house.

30:32.124 --> 30:34.668
Like, fluorescent lights,
like a fuckin' supermarket.

30:34.751 --> 30:37.671
And all these dudes in the audience
started screaming at us.

30:37.754 --> 30:40.591
"Yo, yo, Menudos. What's up?"

30:41.341 --> 30:42.885
"Menudo, I love y'all."

30:44.178 --> 30:46.054
Yeah, they called us "Menudo."

30:47.389 --> 30:50.934
Actually, I think it was "Menudos,"
like, plural.

30:51.476 --> 30:52.477
Yeah.

30:52.561 --> 30:54.938
So yeah, we dropped this look real quick.

30:56.023 --> 30:57.566
Chapter 3:

30:57.649 --> 30:59.902
"The Song that Changed Everything."

31:04.239 --> 31:06.408
So we started writing songs
in a different way.

31:06.491 --> 31:09.620
It wasn't just on a guitar, like,
verse, chorus, verse, chorus.

31:09.703 --> 31:12.706
Fucking around became
our creative process.

31:12.789 --> 31:14.458
It would go something like this.

31:14.541 --> 31:16.084
Mikey.

31:16.168 --> 31:17.920
We'd be walking down the street.

31:20.631 --> 31:21.882
This is how--

31:21.965 --> 31:23.008
Hey.

31:23.091 --> 31:24.801
This is how we'd walk down the street.

31:26.011 --> 31:27.930
-How you doing?
-What's up, man?

31:29.097 --> 31:30.265
We rehearsed.

31:30.974 --> 31:32.476
We'd be walking down the street, right.

31:32.559 --> 31:35.312
And we'd just start going back and forth
with little bits of records

31:35.395 --> 31:37.356
and stupid shit
we thought was real funny, right.

31:37.439 --> 31:40.609
Like, one of us would say a random lyric
from a song we loved like...

31:40.692 --> 31:42.236
Hold it now.

31:42.319 --> 31:45.489
And then another one would be like,
"Yo, that should be a song, like,

31:45.572 --> 31:48.742
he should say, 'Hold it now,'
and then we should have Slick Rick go"...

31:48.825 --> 31:49.868
Hit it!

31:49.952 --> 31:53.247
And then another one would be like,
"It should go"...

31:53.330 --> 31:54.831
Hey, Leroy!

31:54.915 --> 31:56.333
And that's the song.

31:57.626 --> 31:58.627
Now--

31:58.710 --> 32:03.090
And then we'd go into the studio
with that simple and stupid of an idea.

32:03.173 --> 32:04.591
And we'd make a song out of it.

32:04.675 --> 32:06.426
Yo, Leroy!

32:08.512 --> 32:10.931
Hold it now.
Hold it now, hold it now.

32:11.014 --> 32:11.849
Hit it!

32:11.932 --> 32:14.726
Like, Adam would be there
and he'd be tapping away, obsessed,

32:14.810 --> 32:16.937
on the pads of his DX drum machine.

32:17.020 --> 32:19.481
And when he was really psyched,
he'd take the headphones

32:19.565 --> 32:22.526
and he'd rip them off of his head,
throw them to the side, and he'd be like,

32:22.609 --> 32:25.279
"Yo, yo, yo, guys. Check this out."

32:25.362 --> 32:28.073
No, no, no. That's you, Mike.

32:28.156 --> 32:29.533
I was like this.

32:29.616 --> 32:31.451
Well, anyway, he made this--

32:31.535 --> 32:33.412
Honestly, I'm giving you props, Adam.

32:33.495 --> 32:36.164
He made, like, this
hot go-go, swing-type beat.

32:36.248 --> 32:39.293
But when Yauch and I heard that,
we were like, "Shit."

32:39.376 --> 32:43.255
But when that got layered
with this 808 beat,

32:43.338 --> 32:45.507
that changed everything.

32:45.591 --> 32:47.509
Hold it now.
Hold it now, hold it now.

32:47.593 --> 32:49.803
Hit it!

32:50.679 --> 32:53.682
So, the three of us were left
to our own devices

32:53.765 --> 32:56.018
and making music and loving it.

32:56.101 --> 32:58.687
Instead of trying to act and sound
like somebody else,

32:58.770 --> 33:00.189
like how we did on "Rock Hard,"

33:00.272 --> 33:01.815
now we were just being ourselves.

33:01.899 --> 33:04.526
Or at least a fantasy version
of ourselves.

33:05.444 --> 33:07.905
Rick came by the studio
and we played it for him.

33:07.988 --> 33:10.574
And he kinda flipped the fuck out.
He was like,

33:10.657 --> 33:13.118
"Hey, you guys. Don't change anything.

33:13.202 --> 33:16.205
It's great.
I want to play it for Russell.

33:16.288 --> 33:18.332
We need to just put this out."

33:18.415 --> 33:21.627
So, we're surprised, but we are psyched.

33:21.710 --> 33:24.922
Rick mixed it, making it sound bigger
and more professional.

33:25.005 --> 33:27.299
He made that 808 sound crazy.

33:29.134 --> 33:31.136
-Like that.
-Like that.

33:31.220 --> 33:34.389
You could hear it rattling the rear glass
on cars up and down the East Coast.

33:34.473 --> 33:36.975
It also detonated many a PA.

33:37.059 --> 33:40.395
We figured out how to piece together
different elements that we loved,

33:40.479 --> 33:44.274
like beats, samples, scratches,
and turn them into a song.

33:44.358 --> 33:46.068
Into a new style.

33:46.151 --> 33:49.404
Most importantly though,
we found our voice.

33:49.488 --> 33:51.949
Now I chill real ill
When I start to chill

33:52.032 --> 33:54.409
When I fill my pockets
With a knot of dollar bills

33:54.493 --> 33:56.995
Sipping pints of ale
Out the window sill

33:57.079 --> 33:59.540
When I get my fill I'm chilly chill

33:59.623 --> 34:02.417
Now I just got home
Because I'm out on bail

34:02.501 --> 34:05.337
What's the time?
It's time to buy ale

34:05.420 --> 34:09.007
So Russell and Rick put
"Hold It Now, Hit It" out on Def Jam.

34:09.091 --> 34:12.761
And then it starts getting played
on all these mix shows and in clubs,

34:12.844 --> 34:14.388
which is a big deal to us.

34:15.138 --> 34:20.310
Our song was getting played next to songs
like LL Cool J's "Rock the Bells,"

34:20.393 --> 34:23.730
Run-DMC's "Peter Piper,"
songs that we loved.

34:23.813 --> 34:25.190
We got this gig going to Philly.

34:25.274 --> 34:27.234
And we went on
and we just dropped the record.

34:27.317 --> 34:30.112
I remember we put "Hold It Now" on,
and the whole place just went crazy,

34:30.195 --> 34:31.446
like, the whole club.

34:31.530 --> 34:34.699
And that was a pretty amazing feeling.
I was like, "Damn."

34:34.783 --> 34:37.286
So, I'm 19 years old.

34:37.369 --> 34:39.246
I got a little money in my pocket.

34:39.329 --> 34:40.831
Rappers know who I am.

34:40.914 --> 34:42.583
We're getting into clubs for free.

34:42.666 --> 34:45.002
We're getting drink tickets.
We're talking to girls.

34:45.085 --> 34:46.295
-We're getting drunk.
-"Ad-Rock."

34:46.378 --> 34:48.547
We're fuckin' around.
We're writing lyrics on napkins.

34:48.630 --> 34:49.672
We're cracking each other up.

34:49.755 --> 34:53.217
And then we go to the studio
and make a song out of all that shit.

34:53.302 --> 34:54.719
Next night, next song.

34:54.803 --> 34:57.973
Four and three and two and one
What up!

34:58.056 --> 35:01.101
And when I'm on the mic the suckers run
Word!

35:01.185 --> 35:03.103
Down with Ad-Rock and Mike D
And you ain't

35:03.187 --> 35:05.564
And I got more juice
Than Picasso got paint

35:05.647 --> 35:08.150
Got rhymes that are rough
And rhymes that are slick

35:08.233 --> 35:10.694
I'm not surprised you're on my dick

35:10.777 --> 35:11.778
B-E-A-S-T-I-E...

35:11.862 --> 35:15.490
So we're recording all the time,
making songs.

35:15.574 --> 35:18.577
And Russell would just keep
putting them out as singles.

35:18.660 --> 35:21.121
-We put out "Paul Revere."
-Smash hit.

35:21.705 --> 35:23.916
We put out "The New Style," this song.

35:23.999 --> 35:25.167
Smash hit!

35:25.918 --> 35:30.255
And at a certain point, Russell came
into the studio and he was like,

35:30.339 --> 35:33.050
"You guys are the greatest rap group
of all time.

35:33.133 --> 35:35.344
You're gonna be making
a full-length album."

35:35.427 --> 35:39.181
So, while we're doing that, Adam and I,

35:39.264 --> 35:41.350
we're still living
at these shitty apartments.

35:41.433 --> 35:43.644
You know, like you do when
you're 19 years old.

35:43.727 --> 35:48.315
But Yauch moved into this
nice new apartment in Brooklyn Heights.

35:48.398 --> 35:50.108
Now, he lived there for free

35:50.192 --> 35:52.611
because he was
the superintendent of the building.

35:53.195 --> 35:54.696
-It's true.
-Yeah.

35:54.780 --> 35:58.116
So if your radiator broke,
Yauch would come up to fix it.

35:59.451 --> 36:01.370
I mean, he had zero qualifications
for the job,

36:01.453 --> 36:03.872
but he could do just about anything
on instinct.

36:03.956 --> 36:06.583
But late one night,
me and Mike stopped by the apartment,

36:06.667 --> 36:09.545
and he had this tape deck set up
on a table in the kitchen.

36:09.628 --> 36:10.963
But it wasn't a cassette deck.

36:11.046 --> 36:13.382
It was a quarter-inch
reel-to-reel tape deck,

36:13.465 --> 36:14.883
which I didn't even know he had.

36:14.967 --> 36:17.052
And I'm there and I'm studying this,

36:17.135 --> 36:20.138
trying to figure out
what this whole thing is.

36:20.222 --> 36:22.391
I mean, he's got the tape
from the one reel.

36:22.474 --> 36:25.811
And instead of just going to, like,
the other reel, like it usually would,

36:25.894 --> 36:29.106
it comes out the one reel,
it's going around a mic stand,

36:29.189 --> 36:31.567
and then it goes around another mic stand.

36:31.650 --> 36:33.527
And then it goes around a chair.

36:33.610 --> 36:35.112
And then back into the second reel.

36:35.195 --> 36:37.614
I mean, Adam and I
are looking at this thing and we're like,

36:37.698 --> 36:40.742
"This is like
a fucking magic trick, right?"

36:40.826 --> 36:43.662
And then Yauch gets up
and he presses play.

36:50.919 --> 36:52.462
So the intro drumbeat

36:52.546 --> 36:55.299
to Led Zeppelin's
"When the Levee Breaks" starts playing.

36:55.382 --> 36:59.261
But instead of the whole song playing,
it was just the intro beat over and over.

36:59.344 --> 37:02.347
I'd seen DJs do it
with two records and turntables.

37:02.431 --> 37:05.184
But I'd never seen it done
with reel-to-reel tape.

37:05.267 --> 37:08.562
The sound and the visual
were so magical to us.

37:08.645 --> 37:10.063
Yauch told us that he'd heard about

37:10.147 --> 37:13.358
Jimi Hendrix and Sly Stone
doing tape loops and he wanted to try it.

37:13.442 --> 37:15.152
Where did he hear about that?

37:15.235 --> 37:17.779
There was no YouTube or Google
back then, right?

37:18.363 --> 37:20.449
We took Yauch's creation to the studio,

37:20.532 --> 37:23.368
and we made a song called
"Rhymin' & Stealin'."

37:26.288 --> 37:29.333
Ali Baba and the forty thieves

37:29.416 --> 37:32.336
Ali Baba and the forty thieves

37:32.419 --> 37:35.631
Ali Baba and the forty thieves

37:35.714 --> 37:37.716
Torchin' and crackin'
And rhymin' and stealin'...

37:37.799 --> 37:41.220
So while we were writing and recording
what would become Licensed to Ill,

37:41.303 --> 37:45.516
Rick Rubin was also producing
Run-DMC's new album Raising Hell.

37:46.391 --> 37:49.937
Now, their version
of the Aerosmith song "Walk This Way"

37:50.020 --> 37:53.357
was a massive mainstream
radio and MTV hit, right?

37:53.440 --> 37:56.485
And Run-DMC fuckin' blew up
all over the world.

37:56.568 --> 37:58.445
They went on tour that summer in '86.

37:58.529 --> 38:00.113
Russell had us open for them.

38:00.197 --> 38:02.199
Beastie Boys' function
in the Raising Hell Tour

38:02.282 --> 38:04.368
is to get everybody pumped up
to check out the shows.

38:04.451 --> 38:06.286
So we figured
we'd raise a lot of hell on stage.

38:06.370 --> 38:08.956
And we'd just, sort of,
you know, get the audience going.

38:09.039 --> 38:12.543
They were so large
by the time their tour got to Miami,

38:12.626 --> 38:16.588
the promoters upgraded their venue
from basketball arena to baseball stadium.

38:18.048 --> 38:22.427
Joe Perry and Steven Tyler from Aerosmith
were flying down from Miami

38:22.511 --> 38:24.221
just to do the one song with them.

38:24.304 --> 38:26.682
And it was bound to be
a fuckin' spectacle.

38:27.641 --> 38:29.643
She starts swingin'
With the boys in tune

38:29.726 --> 38:31.562
And her feet just fly up in the air...

38:31.645 --> 38:37.192
Cut to the big moment, when Aerosmith
is about to hit the stage to join Run-DMC

38:37.276 --> 38:40.445
to play the number one song
on the entire planet.

38:40.529 --> 38:43.323
They walk out and the crowd goes wild.

38:43.407 --> 38:47.202
But now there's some other guy on stage.

38:47.286 --> 38:48.412
Yauch.

38:52.332 --> 38:54.918
Yauch happened to have a bass with him.

38:55.002 --> 38:58.046
And Jam Master Jay from Run-DMC
thought it'd be funny

38:58.130 --> 39:01.758
for him to play bass with them
and Aerosmith for the big song,

39:01.842 --> 39:05.971
on stage, in a baseball stadium, in Miami.

39:06.054 --> 39:09.349
And Yauch fucking delivered majestically.

39:09.433 --> 39:13.061
The look on the Aerosmith guys' faces
was fantastic bemusement.

39:13.145 --> 39:15.230
"Who's this dirty drunk guy on stage?

39:15.314 --> 39:18.275
And why is he playing bass with us?"

39:19.359 --> 39:20.736
Throughout the whole song,

39:20.819 --> 39:23.363
Yauch kept trying
to go back-to-back guitar-player style

39:23.447 --> 39:26.450
with fucking Joe Perry,
who was having none of it, right?

39:26.533 --> 39:27.534
And it's like--

39:27.618 --> 39:32.080
It ended up with Yauch chasing him
around the stage running backwards.

39:32.164 --> 39:35.792
And all of us were
on the side of the stage,

39:35.876 --> 39:40.464
watching, screaming,
laughing and loving it.

39:42.633 --> 39:46.178
And not only was it really fucking fun
being on tour

39:46.261 --> 39:48.180
and hanging out with Run-DMC,

39:48.263 --> 39:51.308
but we learned so much
watching them night after night.

39:51.391 --> 39:53.810
I mean, it was like
we were at rap finishing school.

39:53.894 --> 39:58.690
Yes, yes, y'all, we don't stop
Keep it on, shockin' the place

39:58.774 --> 39:59.775
Well...

40:01.109 --> 40:02.402
Got nothin' to prove

40:02.486 --> 40:05.072
Pay attention
My intention is to bust a move

40:05.155 --> 40:08.033
Drinkin' quarts and cans
And bottles and sixes

40:08.116 --> 40:11.119
Between the turntables
Keep the...

40:11.203 --> 40:13.580
My name's Run
I got the deuces wild

40:13.664 --> 40:16.333
Listen to the rhymes
I'm bustin' the style

40:16.416 --> 40:18.919
Name's DMC and he's by my side

40:19.002 --> 40:21.547
So take the mic...

40:21.630 --> 40:23.173
But when we got back home,

40:23.257 --> 40:27.302
we found out that Rick had gone
and mixed and finished our whole record.

40:27.386 --> 40:30.055
It was weird that he just went
and did it without us knowing.

40:30.764 --> 40:34.351
I mean, Yauch was always
into the technical aspects of recording,

40:34.434 --> 40:38.021
so I'm sure it must've bummed him out
or pissed him off.

40:38.105 --> 40:40.899
But what Rick did was pretty incredible.

40:40.983 --> 40:42.818
He took our weird rap songs

40:42.901 --> 40:47.447
and he made them sound clean, and big,
and polished, and ready for the radio.

40:47.531 --> 40:50.826
They are more like real anthems
and less like a joke.

40:55.247 --> 40:59.251
Brass Monkey, that funky Monkey

40:59.334 --> 41:03.213
Brass Monkey junkie
That funky Monkey

41:03.297 --> 41:04.798
Brass Monkey

41:05.549 --> 41:06.967
Chapter 4:

41:07.050 --> 41:10.596
"Earlier We Had Mentioned a Song
That We Thought Had Changed Everything.

41:10.679 --> 41:12.181
And It Had, In a Way.

41:12.264 --> 41:15.767
But This Is Actually the Song
That Changed Everything."

41:18.187 --> 41:23.066
So, fun fact, we were almost done
with our record Licensed to Ill,

41:23.150 --> 41:24.693
but Russell said it wasn't long enough

41:24.776 --> 41:27.029
and so we needed just,
like, one more song.

41:27.112 --> 41:30.574
And Yauch and his friend Tom Cushman
had a side band called Brooklyn.

41:30.657 --> 41:33.202
And they had this song called
"Fight for Your Right (To Party)."

41:33.285 --> 41:34.328
And Yauch was like,

41:34.411 --> 41:37.247
"Why don't we use that Brooklyn song
and use it for Beastie Boys?"

41:37.331 --> 41:38.498
They made that song as a joke.

41:38.582 --> 41:42.753
Like, a kind of fake anthem
making fun of party bros and frat guys.

41:42.836 --> 41:47.090
Now, we had never actually met
a party bro or a frat guy.

41:47.633 --> 41:50.052
But we thought that shit
was hilarious to make fun of.

41:50.135 --> 41:53.597
So our big idea was
to take a little bit of this.

41:55.057 --> 41:56.350
A little bit of that.

41:57.976 --> 41:59.645
A little bit of this.

42:01.146 --> 42:04.483
And then about half a cup of that.

42:04.566 --> 42:07.778
And then you mix
all these things together.

42:07.861 --> 42:09.363
And what you get is...

42:09.446 --> 42:13.951
You gotta fight for your right

42:14.034 --> 42:16.537
To party

42:17.829 --> 42:20.040
Shit starts happening really fast.

42:20.123 --> 42:23.001
I mean, it felt like the next day,
our record comes out.

42:23.085 --> 42:24.920
Then the video comes out.

42:25.003 --> 42:26.046
It's everywhere.

42:26.129 --> 42:28.841
I mean, I'm just at home
eating my Fruity Pebbles.

42:28.924 --> 42:32.636
And I'm watching it play, like,
five times an hour on MTV.

42:32.719 --> 42:34.388
Everybody watched MTV back then.

42:34.471 --> 42:36.849
And we were on that shit constantly.

42:36.932 --> 42:40.769
Our homemade video that we made
at our friend's apartment is now playing

42:40.853 --> 42:44.982
in between fuckin' Michael Jackson,
Prince and Tina Turner videos.

42:45.065 --> 42:48.527
I mean, that was some crazy shit.

42:49.111 --> 42:51.530
So, we went from being famous in--

42:51.613 --> 42:53.907
-Crazy shit.
-Come on.

42:56.785 --> 42:59.997
We went from being famous in,
like, a 14-block radius

43:00.080 --> 43:02.583
to being known
in the underground hip-hop scene

43:02.666 --> 43:06.879
to being recognized walking down
the street after Licensed to Ill came out.

43:06.962 --> 43:10.382
I mean, everywhere I went
people would start yelling like...

43:10.465 --> 43:12.342
"Yo, Mike D."

43:12.426 --> 43:14.136
"What's up, homeboy?"

43:14.219 --> 43:16.430
Same thing with me and Yauch.
We'd be walking down the street,

43:16.513 --> 43:18.557
someone might recognize us,
and they'd be like...

43:18.640 --> 43:20.434
"Yo, Mike D."

43:23.103 --> 43:24.229
True story.

43:24.313 --> 43:27.149
So, we were really feeling ourselves.

43:27.232 --> 43:29.026
And about two months later,

43:29.109 --> 43:33.572
Russell sends us out on our first
big headlining tour of America.

43:33.655 --> 43:34.656
So what did we do?

43:34.740 --> 43:37.701
We brought Dave Scilken
and Cey and DJ Hurricane

43:37.784 --> 43:39.203
and all our other friends with us.

43:39.286 --> 43:41.580
Our record was selling like crazy.

43:41.663 --> 43:43.999
And that's when things started
to feel really different.

43:44.082 --> 43:46.126
Being famous in our city was one thing.

43:46.210 --> 43:48.545
But being famous in a mall
in Missoula, Montana

43:48.629 --> 43:50.839
is something else entirely.

43:50.923 --> 43:52.591
So before the tour started,

43:52.674 --> 43:54.676
Russell Simmons had us meet
with some weird dude

43:54.760 --> 43:57.387
to talk about what we wanted on stage.

43:57.471 --> 44:01.892
So just to fuck with this guy,
we were like, "Yeah, homes, you know,

44:01.975 --> 44:07.064
we want a fuckin' ten-foot
six-pack of Budweiser for a DJ riser."

44:07.147 --> 44:09.274
-"Check."
-"We want a fuckin' go-go dancer cage."

44:09.358 --> 44:10.651
-"Check."
-"We want this big box

44:10.734 --> 44:13.529
with a 25-foot dick coming out of it
at the end of the show, right?"

44:13.612 --> 44:15.113
-"That's easy. Yeah. No problem."
-Right?

44:15.197 --> 44:16.615
And the next thing you know,

44:16.698 --> 44:20.035
we get to Missoula, Montana
for the first show, and there it is.

44:29.586 --> 44:32.297
Mike D, wop it up, wop it up, wop it up.

44:32.840 --> 44:35.843
We were wopping it up.
We were pretty excited.

44:36.718 --> 44:40.430
Now, we had no idea who was gonna show up
to see us play.

44:41.265 --> 44:44.393
We definitely didn't think
that the party bro frat dudes

44:44.476 --> 44:46.270
that we were making fun of
were gonna come.

44:46.353 --> 44:50.566
But turns out that they loved
"Fight for Your Right (To Party)."

44:50.649 --> 44:53.026
And you know what? We liked being loved.

44:53.110 --> 44:56.947
So fuck it.
Pass me a 40. Let's get fucked up.

44:58.907 --> 45:03.537
Now, everything that Russell had said
would happen was actually happening.

45:03.620 --> 45:07.916
He'd show up all the time in some random
city on tour and remind us. He'd be like,

45:08.000 --> 45:10.002
"See, I told you motherfuckers.

45:10.085 --> 45:12.546
Y'all gonna be bigger than Cap'n Crunch."

45:13.755 --> 45:15.757
The shows kept getting bigger and bigger.

45:15.841 --> 45:18.594
A thousand people one night,
2,000 the next.

45:18.677 --> 45:21.221
-Chicago, Atlanta--
-Miami.

45:21.305 --> 45:22.514
Miami.

45:23.140 --> 45:24.141
-Munich.
-Munich.

45:24.224 --> 45:25.225
Houston.

45:25.309 --> 45:28.145
Shows, hotels,
after-parties, after-after-parties.

45:28.228 --> 45:34.193
Now we were having the fucking times
of our lives, and shit was blowing up.

45:37.321 --> 45:39.531
Licensed to Ill has been certified

45:39.615 --> 45:43.493
as the fastest-selling debut
in the history of their label.

45:43.577 --> 45:45.662
-These are...
-The Beastie Boys.

45:45.746 --> 45:47.039
You got it.

45:51.627 --> 45:53.629
Foot on the pedal
Never ever false metal

45:53.712 --> 45:55.923
Engine running hotter
Than a boiling kettle...

45:56.006 --> 45:59.510
In 1987, the Beastie Boys
are gonna be taking over America!

46:01.428 --> 46:03.847
On location
Touring around the nation

46:03.931 --> 46:06.350
Beastie Boys always on vacation...

46:06.433 --> 46:09.144
How'd you all three get together?
Juilliard?

46:11.271 --> 46:13.690
Ain't no fakin'
Your money I'm takin'

46:13.774 --> 46:16.193
Going coast to coast
To watch all the girlies shakin'

46:16.276 --> 46:18.153
While you're at the job
Workin' 9 to 5

46:18.237 --> 46:21.198
The Beastie Boys at the Garden
Cold kickin' it live

46:21.281 --> 46:24.660
But something weird
was happening during all of this.

46:24.743 --> 46:29.581
We morphed from making fun of party bros
to actually becoming those dudes.

46:29.665 --> 46:31.291
Let's bang our heads together!

46:35.337 --> 46:36.839
Yo, what's up, MTV?

46:36.922 --> 46:39.383
-We're the Beastie Boys!
-Yeah!

46:39.466 --> 46:43.345
So songs that we'd written as a joke
took on a whole new light.

46:44.096 --> 46:47.099
For example, we had a song
on our first record

46:47.182 --> 46:51.144
that was supposed to be this,
like, stupid and ironic joke,

46:51.228 --> 46:53.230
but, understandably, it wasn't that funny.

46:53.814 --> 46:55.941
Now I'm gonna tell you the lyrics
to that song.

46:56.942 --> 47:00.529
"Girls, to do the dishes.

47:01.154 --> 47:03.532
Girls, to clean up my room.

47:04.366 --> 47:06.618
Girls, to do my laundry.

47:07.327 --> 47:10.581
Girls, and in the bathroom. Girls."

47:18.964 --> 47:21.633
We didn't know what was a joke
and what wasn't a joke at that time.

47:21.717 --> 47:24.178
I mean, shit got really blurry.

47:27.598 --> 47:30.601
The lines just got kind of blurred for us.

47:30.684 --> 47:35.731
Like, I have a break from tour,
but then I didn't even call my friends

47:35.814 --> 47:38.317
because I just didn't know
how to relate to them anymore.

47:38.400 --> 47:42.154
I mean, I just didn't even recognize the
person that I had become at that point.

47:42.237 --> 47:45.616
I remember one specific time
I saw Kate Schellenbach at a deli,

47:46.283 --> 47:47.367
and I didn't say hi.

47:48.410 --> 47:50.078
Maybe she didn't see me. I don't know.

47:50.162 --> 47:51.288
But if she did see me,

47:51.371 --> 47:55.167
she definitely would have seen
a very different version of me.

47:55.959 --> 47:58.629
I remember I was in the back
of the store by the coolers,

47:58.712 --> 48:00.422
and she was up front paying for something,

48:00.506 --> 48:03.008
and she was just laughing
and having fun with her friend.

48:03.842 --> 48:06.053
And I guess I didn't say hi
'cause I was embarrassed

48:06.136 --> 48:07.804
thinking about how much I'd changed.

48:10.849 --> 48:12.309
Also, speaking of change,

48:12.768 --> 48:16.605
I'd like to take a quick sidenote
to apologize to my brother, Matthew,

48:16.688 --> 48:18.565
for that time I kept calling him "money"

48:18.649 --> 48:20.776
when we were just trying
to have a serious conversation.

48:20.859 --> 48:23.028
I was like,
"Yo, money. I don't know, money."

48:23.111 --> 48:26.990
And he was like, "Yo, what the fuck
are you doing? We're just talking."

48:27.950 --> 48:29.076
Anyway.

48:29.159 --> 48:31.537
Matthew, I'm sorry. That was a dick move.

48:33.080 --> 48:37.584
Which brings us to Chapter 5:
"Dicks in a Box."

48:38.919 --> 48:42.965
Our record was selling like crazy,
and the shows were getting crazier.

48:43.048 --> 48:44.633
A lot of booze and a lot of cursing.

48:44.716 --> 48:48.345
Now, in the South, they were trying
to ban us for lewd behavior.

48:48.428 --> 48:51.974
We would literally have to sneak off
a stage after a show and into a van

48:52.057 --> 48:54.726
and get across state lines
so we wouldn't get arrested.

48:54.810 --> 48:56.478
The British press were around at the time,

48:56.562 --> 48:58.230
and they were writing
all these stories about us.

48:58.313 --> 49:01.316
And so by the time we got to England
to go on tour,

49:01.400 --> 49:03.277
they made up all of these stories about us

49:03.360 --> 49:05.654
and put them on the cover
of the actual newspapers.

49:06.613 --> 49:10.242
So there was this weird expectation
for us to be fucking maniacs.

49:11.326 --> 49:15.831
We really did not do that. Just as
a sidenote, that just did not happen.

49:22.296 --> 49:26.466
Seriously, I do like it though.
They say, "'Horrible' Horovitz."

49:26.550 --> 49:28.135
-I really like that. But--
-Yeah.

49:28.218 --> 49:31.054
You know, it's too bad that didn't stick.

49:31.138 --> 49:32.806
-"Horrible" Horovitz?
-Yeah, it's a good name.

49:32.890 --> 49:35.309
There was an actual meeting of Parliament

49:35.392 --> 49:38.145
to decide whether they should let us
into the UK or not.

49:38.604 --> 49:39.855
Seriously.

49:39.938 --> 49:44.151
With each city we went to on the tour,
the crowd developed a

49:44.234 --> 49:45.986
"you motherfuckers ain't shit

49:46.069 --> 49:48.655
compared to us here" type of vibe, right?

49:49.364 --> 49:53.368
So by the time we got to
the last show of that tour in Liverpool,

49:53.452 --> 49:55.329
the punters went berserk.

49:56.163 --> 49:59.499
Right into the first song
of our show in Liverpool,

49:59.583 --> 50:02.961
the crowd started chanting these football
chants and throwing shit at us.

50:03.045 --> 50:05.839
And then it turned into
a full-on hailstorm of beer can--

50:05.923 --> 50:07.674
Jesus Christ, Mike. Come on.

50:08.258 --> 50:11.178
A full-on hailstorm
of beer cans and bottles.

50:11.678 --> 50:15.516
So mid-show, we broke the fuck out,
and we drove back to London.

50:16.433 --> 50:19.353
After all this, you think we would've
taken a break for a sec, right?

50:19.436 --> 50:21.438
You know, just to let things
calm down a little.

50:21.522 --> 50:22.523
But we didn't.

50:22.606 --> 50:26.235
We went straight from all of that
to tour Japan.

50:26.318 --> 50:27.694
Then after the tour of Japan,

50:27.778 --> 50:31.323
we came back to the United States
and toured that shit all over again.

50:31.406 --> 50:32.574
No breaks.

50:33.742 --> 50:34.910
We just didn't stop.

50:35.661 --> 50:37.704
Russell was like,
"You're going back on tour.

50:37.788 --> 50:40.999
You're gonna make a lot of money.
And you're gonna be happy rock stars."

50:41.083 --> 50:43.210
"All right, Russell. Whatever you say."

50:46.255 --> 50:47.673
I mean, he was the manager.

50:47.756 --> 50:51.635
If he's like, "You're going out on tour,"
well, then that's what you do.

50:52.719 --> 50:54.429
We didn't really question it so much.

50:54.513 --> 50:57.599
We felt like we had to be
out there doing this.

50:57.683 --> 51:00.477
But we weren't really mature enough
to be able to express

51:00.561 --> 51:03.105
that we started to not like our own songs.

51:03.730 --> 51:05.524
Which is a really shitty feeling.

51:06.567 --> 51:10.070
Yauch was the first one to start
showing signs of not wanting to be there.

51:10.988 --> 51:13.448
I mean, it's not like we weren't having
fun as friends.

51:13.991 --> 51:16.326
It's just, the show started
to become just that.

51:16.410 --> 51:17.411
A show.

51:17.995 --> 51:19.121
A fucking gimmick.

51:20.372 --> 51:21.832
I mean, we were all tired.

51:22.749 --> 51:24.126
We missed our families.

51:24.668 --> 51:25.919
We missed being home.

51:26.837 --> 51:29.798
We missed things like
just going to the deli to get a sandwich.

51:30.465 --> 51:32.801
We missed being the people we used to be.

51:33.510 --> 51:36.597
All the dumb shit we were saying
and the go-go cage

51:36.680 --> 51:39.516
and the fucking beer
and the dick in the box...

51:39.600 --> 51:41.977
the whole thing was just
getting fucking embarrassing.

51:43.061 --> 51:45.230
We were burning out.

51:45.314 --> 51:48.233
In a flash,
Beastie Boys went from being

51:48.317 --> 51:51.069
the funny, tipsy guy
with the lampshade on his head

51:51.153 --> 51:55.157
to the ugly drunk dude that people
were trying to get out of their apartment.

51:55.240 --> 51:57.993
It's like that Bill Murray movie
Groundhog Day.

51:58.535 --> 52:01.788
You know, where he keeps living
the same day over and over.

52:02.623 --> 52:05.083
But in our movie, it was the fucking dick

52:05.167 --> 52:08.587
going up in the air
at the end of every show.

52:10.172 --> 52:15.260
The problem was, we built the fucking box,
and we're the dicks stuck inside the box.

52:16.178 --> 52:19.389
It became, "How can we
get through the show fast enough

52:19.473 --> 52:25.395
so the stupid dick can get back in the box
and we can get the fuck off stage."

52:38.158 --> 52:39.618
What ever happened to the Beastie Boys?

52:39.701 --> 52:42.162
In late 1986,
they released Licensed to Ill,

52:42.246 --> 52:44.623
one of the most successful
debut albums of all time.

52:44.706 --> 52:47.459
But they've yet to record a follow-up
and have gone their separate ways

52:47.543 --> 52:50.295
since their tour with Run-DMC
ended last fall.

52:50.379 --> 52:53.507
These days, Mike D and MCA
are playing in bands around New York.

52:53.590 --> 52:56.802
As for Ad-Rock, he's been in Los Angeles
making his movie debut.

53:09.231 --> 53:11.400
You just transferred
to Sherman, didn't you?

53:12.609 --> 53:14.945
Yeah. Moved here last summer.

53:15.028 --> 53:16.488
Like, to this great house.

53:17.406 --> 53:18.949
Do you wanna help me wash this car?

53:20.075 --> 53:21.076
Now?

53:33.881 --> 53:34.882
Okay.

53:36.758 --> 53:37.885
Okay, so...

53:38.927 --> 53:41.638
That was a movie I was in
right after the Licensed to Ill tour.

53:42.431 --> 53:45.184
It's called Lost Angels, and it's awful.

53:45.267 --> 53:47.102
Please don't go look it up, okay?

53:47.186 --> 53:49.021
Please don't look it up and watch it.

53:49.646 --> 53:50.689
Please don't.

53:50.772 --> 53:51.773
Anyways...

53:53.233 --> 53:54.776
The last 12 months of touring

53:54.860 --> 53:57.946
felt like a tornado had ripped me
out of my apartment in New York,

53:58.030 --> 54:02.367
spun me barfing all around the world,
and dropped me on my head in Hollywood.

54:02.951 --> 54:05.245
And that's when I got cast
to do that movie.

54:05.829 --> 54:09.583
I was 22 years old, and I did not know
what the fuck had just happened.

54:10.417 --> 54:12.961
I hadn't talked to Adam or Mike
for a couple months.

54:13.045 --> 54:14.713
We didn't have a fight
or a falling out or anything,

54:14.796 --> 54:18.425
but it was, like, the first time we didn't
really wanna hang out with each other.

54:18.509 --> 54:22.179
I guess we just needed a break
to go our separate ways for a minute.

54:23.013 --> 54:26.517
Yauch was in New York, and he was
really into his other band, Brooklyn.

54:27.643 --> 54:29.978
And I was in LA doing that movie.

54:30.646 --> 54:32.147
And Mike was...

54:33.023 --> 54:34.233
Mike, what were you doing?

54:34.316 --> 54:39.071
Honestly, I was just
experimenting with a lot of drugs.

54:39.488 --> 54:40.489
Right, right.

54:43.784 --> 54:48.372
So as for me,
I was running from all kinds of things.

54:48.455 --> 54:51.708
My mom had just passed away,
right before Licensed to Ill came out.

54:51.792 --> 54:54.378
And the chance to escape
into becoming a different person

54:54.461 --> 54:56.839
couldn't have come
at the more perfect time.

54:57.673 --> 55:01.426
So after the tour, I continued to run away
from anything I was feeling.

55:03.053 --> 55:05.848
One day after filming,
I got back to the hotel I was staying at,

55:05.931 --> 55:07.182
and someone at the front desk said

55:07.266 --> 55:09.351
that there was a package
waiting for me in my room.

55:09.852 --> 55:13.355
I get in my room and there's this
huge box, and it's from Yauch.

55:14.022 --> 55:17.359
I open the box,
and inside the box is another box.

55:17.442 --> 55:20.070
And then another box,
and another box, and another box.

55:21.280 --> 55:24.992
And then there was this big ziplock bag
with coffee grounds in it.

55:25.617 --> 55:28.829
So inside of that mess
was a cassette tape.

55:30.372 --> 55:33.041
It was the demos for his band Brooklyn.

55:33.750 --> 55:37.254
It's weird to go from talking to someone
every single day for years

55:37.337 --> 55:39.965
to all of a sudden not hear from them
for a couple months.

55:40.048 --> 55:42.801
So it was really cool
that he sent me this tape of his music.

55:43.302 --> 55:46.138
Like, he did it
so we could be connected as friends.

55:46.930 --> 55:48.891
But it definitely made me pause for a sec.

55:48.974 --> 55:50.976
Like, maybe that's just
what he's doing now.

55:51.059 --> 55:53.812
Maybe he's done with Beastie Boys,
and we're not a band anymore.

55:54.313 --> 55:59.193
Well, turns out we kind of weren't a band,
because Yauch quit.

55:59.276 --> 56:02.613
I mean, he didn't tell us about it
until a couple years later.

56:03.113 --> 56:05.616
He was sick of being
the drunk guy at the party.

56:05.699 --> 56:08.118
Yauch said that Russell
wasn't trying to hear him

56:08.202 --> 56:10.662
and he kept trying to convince him
that it was all fine

56:10.746 --> 56:12.372
and that he should just get back on tour

56:12.456 --> 56:15.250
and put water in a beer can
and splash it all around

56:15.334 --> 56:17.544
and a whole bunch of other clown stuff.

56:17.628 --> 56:19.046
That was enough for Yauch.

56:19.129 --> 56:21.673
So he told Russell, "I quit."

56:21.757 --> 56:26.053
So during all this madness,
we stopped being paid royalties.

56:26.720 --> 56:28.305
We made money for playing shows,

56:28.388 --> 56:31.016
like, big shows, like,
Madison Square Garden shows.

56:31.099 --> 56:36.104
But zero dollars for the multiplatinum
smash hit Licensed to Ill.

56:36.188 --> 56:38.941
The fucking record
that a group of friends made together,

56:39.024 --> 56:41.860
had intense and real fun making together,

56:41.944 --> 56:43.779
spent hours and hours laughing

56:43.862 --> 56:48.659
at coffee shops and clubs and studios,
dorm rooms, taxis, and parties...

56:48.742 --> 56:51.078
But now, for whatever reason,

56:51.161 --> 56:55.123
the record label decides
that they should not fucking pay us.

56:55.666 --> 56:58.585
Rick and Russell. Our friends. Def Jam.

56:59.169 --> 57:01.088
We'd been there with them
from the beginning.

57:01.630 --> 57:05.342
We felt that Def Jam's success
was success for us and vice versa.

57:05.425 --> 57:07.010
'Cause we were all friends.

57:07.094 --> 57:09.763
Allegedly, Russell said
that we were in breach of our contract

57:09.847 --> 57:13.058
because we hadn't started recording
a new record for Def Jam yet.

57:13.517 --> 57:17.104
I mean, Russell wanted a "Fight for
Your Right (To Party) Part 2" now.

57:17.187 --> 57:18.188
When Russell signed us,

57:18.272 --> 57:22.067
we thought that he believed in us
in some bigger way.

57:22.150 --> 57:26.488
But in hindsight, he just needed three
white rappers to get on MTV.

57:26.572 --> 57:28.365
I mean, we could've been anybody.

57:29.908 --> 57:32.244
Anyways, back to me. Los Angeles.

57:33.495 --> 57:35.664
So I'm out there,
and I'm working on this project--

57:35.747 --> 57:38.333
Actually, Spike, just indulge me.

57:38.417 --> 57:41.253
Can we see that clip
where Adam goes into the pool?

57:41.336 --> 57:43.130
-No, we can just--
-Can we see that again?

57:48.385 --> 57:50.554
But play it, like, a few times in a row.

57:50.637 --> 57:51.722
Just a few times.

57:56.560 --> 57:59.188
Now, I've never driven a car
into a swimming pool.

57:59.271 --> 58:00.856
-Yeah. Clearly.
-Okay.

58:00.939 --> 58:04.276
But I'd like to think
that if I were to do that,

58:04.359 --> 58:07.487
and when I felt the car
going into the swimming pool,

58:07.571 --> 58:12.242
my reaction wouldn't be some kind of,
like, sexual, orgasmic experience.

58:15.037 --> 58:16.788
I don't know, you guys.
It's pretty fucking hot.

58:16.872 --> 58:18.373
I don't know what else to say.

58:20.167 --> 58:22.336
Anyways, I was out in Hollywood.

58:22.419 --> 58:24.087
All right, all right, all right.

58:26.924 --> 58:30.886
So, I'm out in Hollywood, and I was
at this big Hollywood party, right?

58:30.969 --> 58:33.972
And I'm hanging out by the pool,
as you do at Hollywood parties.

58:34.640 --> 58:38.310
And so I hear this awesome music
playing from somewhere.

58:41.438 --> 58:44.858
"What is that?" So I'm trying to
figure out where this music's coming from,

58:44.942 --> 58:47.444
so I'm walking around the party
trying to figure it out, right?

58:47.528 --> 58:49.196
-Champagne, sir?
-Thank you, Mike D.

58:50.072 --> 58:52.533
This is how I walk
when I walk through Hollywood parties.

58:53.450 --> 58:54.785
Donnie Wahlberg? Hey. What's up?

58:54.868 --> 58:55.994
Are you done with that?

58:56.787 --> 59:00.707
So, I'm following the sound to try
to figure out where it's coming from,

59:00.791 --> 59:02.376
and I get to a cassette player.

59:02.960 --> 59:05.379
And at the cassette player
is this guy Matt Dike

59:05.462 --> 59:07.172
and these guys the Dust Brothers.

59:08.715 --> 59:10.592
And they said that they'd made this music.

59:10.676 --> 59:14.346
It was so awesome that I called Adam
and Mike the next day, and I was like,

59:14.429 --> 59:17.766
"You guys should come out to Los Angeles,
and we should meet with these guys."

59:17.850 --> 59:18.934
And they came out.

59:19.017 --> 59:21.311
Now, I didn't know what it was
gonna be like when they came out,

59:21.395 --> 59:24.439
because we hadn't seen each
other for a few months.

59:24.523 --> 59:27.943
But when they got there,
it felt like how it was supposed to be.

59:28.026 --> 59:30.195
We hung out, we listened to this music.

59:30.696 --> 59:33.824
So, like, any of this other stuff
we were doing was fine, right?

59:33.907 --> 59:38.370
Yauch's band Brooklyn,
me in the movie, Mike being Mike.

59:40.163 --> 59:41.999
But it reminded me

59:42.082 --> 59:44.960
the Beastie Boys is what we should
be doing with our lives, right?

59:45.043 --> 59:46.128
For me.

59:49.590 --> 59:52.217
And we made a very conscious
decision moving forward.

59:52.801 --> 59:57.681
No manager, no producer,
no record label would call the shots.

59:57.764 --> 59:59.766
It would be just the three of us.

01:00:04.771 --> 01:00:05.647
So...

01:00:06.982 --> 01:00:11.445
There's not that many times in your life
when you realize you're in a new chapter.

01:00:11.528 --> 01:00:13.947
Chapter 6: "A New Chapter."

01:00:17.117 --> 01:00:20.954
The music the Dust Brothers was making
was incredible

01:00:21.038 --> 01:00:24.333
and totally inspired us
to want to make another record.

01:00:24.416 --> 01:00:27.503
But the reality is,
to continue being a band,

01:00:27.586 --> 01:00:30.130
we had to meet with
some new record labels.

01:00:30.214 --> 01:00:31.882
One of them was Capitol Records.

01:00:31.965 --> 01:00:35.344
So we go up to meet the big-time
president guy and he was like,

01:00:35.427 --> 01:00:38.639
"You guys didn't do anything
on Licensed to Ill. Let's be real.

01:00:38.722 --> 01:00:40.474
Rick and Russell did all that shit.

01:00:40.557 --> 01:00:42.351
You're, like, their creation."

01:00:42.434 --> 01:00:46.146
But the same time,
they're willing to bet on us,

01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:49.942
even though it's a long shot,
that we just might give them

01:00:50.025 --> 01:00:52.611
a "Fight for Your Right
(To Party) Part 2."

01:00:52.694 --> 01:00:55.072
Now, we're embarrassed about that song,

01:00:55.155 --> 01:00:59.535
but we're not so embarrassed
that we won't use it to get a record deal.

01:01:01.787 --> 01:01:04.998
Right? So we get the record deal,
but now we need a manager.

01:01:05.082 --> 01:01:09.086
And so we pick a manager
for maybe not the smartest reasons ever.

01:01:09.419 --> 01:01:13.298
We picked this guy because he managed
Kenny Rogers and Lionel Richie.

01:01:13.382 --> 01:01:15.133
And we thought that shit was funny.

01:01:15.926 --> 01:01:19.471
Sometimes dumb jokes aren't always

01:01:19.555 --> 01:01:22.516
the best things to guide
your financial future.

01:01:22.599 --> 01:01:23.934
All right?

01:01:24.017 --> 01:01:26.436
Also, we had this big idea.

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:29.481
Like, okay, if we all live
in a house together,

01:01:29.565 --> 01:01:32.025
we're really gonna get
a lot of stuff done.

01:01:32.109 --> 01:01:36.697
So we took all this money
from our new fat record contract

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:42.369
and we rented a super-expensive
fancy house up in the Hollywood Hills.

01:01:43.787 --> 01:01:46.081
But not just any house
in the Hollywood Hills.

01:01:46.164 --> 01:01:49.418
This house was like a '70s museum.

01:01:49.501 --> 01:01:53.505
It was like Hart to Hart combined with
The Love Boat combined with, like,

01:01:53.589 --> 01:01:55.591
the Regal Beagle from Three's Company.

01:01:56.675 --> 01:01:59.261
My man, Hart to Hart
was just a great callout right there.

01:01:59.344 --> 01:02:00.345
That was awesome.

01:02:01.096 --> 01:02:05.350
Anyway, this house was owned
by Alex and Madilyn Grasshoff.

01:02:05.434 --> 01:02:06.727
-Exactly.
-Small detail.

01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:09.271
Now, inside of this house
there's a locked closet.

01:02:09.354 --> 01:02:12.232
And so, you know,
when you're, like, in your 20s

01:02:12.316 --> 01:02:16.612
and you're curious and super high,
and there's a locked closet,

01:02:17.237 --> 01:02:18.405
what do you do?

01:02:18.488 --> 01:02:20.199
You fucking kick that closet open, right?

01:02:20.282 --> 01:02:21.491
You wanna know what's inside.

01:02:21.575 --> 01:02:25.537
Inside the closet
is all of Madilyn Grasshoff's

01:02:25.621 --> 01:02:29.333
awesome ensembles from the '70s.

01:02:29.416 --> 01:02:30.751
I mean...

01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:32.544
Yeah. Yeah.

01:02:32.628 --> 01:02:37.216
Like, we're talking suede
patchwork duster coats.

01:02:37.299 --> 01:02:39.384
I mean, like, fucking satin jumpsuits.

01:02:39.468 --> 01:02:42.721
Everything transplendent and wonderful.

01:02:42.804 --> 01:02:46.266
Like fur hats. I mean, special vests.

01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:48.435
You guys, would you
rather go have breakfast,

01:02:48.519 --> 01:02:51.146
you know, like,
in your Oscar Madison clothes?

01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:53.857
Or would you rather
go have breakfast like this?

01:02:56.527 --> 01:02:58.820
This is the house
that we stayed in, right? That's Mike.

01:02:58.904 --> 01:03:00.113
You look wonderful.

01:03:00.197 --> 01:03:01.406
Thank you, Adam.

01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:05.619
If you have a swimming pool and you don't
have a bridge over it, you're fucking up.

01:03:06.119 --> 01:03:08.038
But listen.
So my room wasn't in the house.

01:03:08.121 --> 01:03:10.832
It was, like, this weird side room
that was, like, over here.

01:03:10.916 --> 01:03:13.126
And in the swimming pool
was this little window

01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:16.839
that looked right into my room
and from the room into the pool.

01:03:16.922 --> 01:03:19.049
And every couple days,
at 6:00 in the morning,

01:03:19.132 --> 01:03:20.801
I'd hear this loud banging noise,

01:03:20.884 --> 01:03:22.928
and I'd wake up and see this.

01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:27.641
It was Yauch saying,
"Let's go get breakfast."

01:03:28.892 --> 01:03:32.688
So our daily routine was to wake up
at this crazy Grasshoff house,

01:03:32.771 --> 01:03:33.981
go have some breakfast,

01:03:34.064 --> 01:03:36.859
and then we'd go meet Matt Dike
and the Dust Brothers at the studio.

01:03:40.070 --> 01:03:41.363
Matt Dike was a DJ,

01:03:41.446 --> 01:03:45.200
and he had thousands and thousands
of records piled all over his apartment.

01:03:45.284 --> 01:03:47.119
And he was just cool.

01:03:47.202 --> 01:03:49.705
I don't know.
We wanted to know what he knew about.

01:03:49.788 --> 01:03:53.041
The Dust Brothers were computer science
students at Claremont College.

01:03:54.084 --> 01:03:55.335
EZ Mike was a DJ.

01:03:56.336 --> 01:03:58.046
John was, like, this computer wiz.

01:03:58.672 --> 01:04:02.301
And shit, we'd never even seen
a computer in a recording studio before.

01:04:02.926 --> 01:04:05.012
And we went sample crazy.

01:04:06.054 --> 01:04:07.055
It's the joint

01:04:15.439 --> 01:04:18.984
The Dust Brothers opened up
a whole new creative world for us.

01:04:19.067 --> 01:04:22.446
We were just layering
and layering and layering,

01:04:22.529 --> 01:04:26.241
making each song as dense as possible
with lyrics and samples and jokes.

01:04:26.325 --> 01:04:28.285
We're taking two things, three things.

01:04:28.368 --> 01:04:31.205
We're blending them in and out
so the song is like a whole collage.

01:04:31.288 --> 01:04:34.625
We thought we were
on some next-level shit.

01:04:34.708 --> 01:04:36.960
So like a pimp I'm pimpin'
I got a boat to eat shrimp in

01:04:37.044 --> 01:04:39.254
Nothing wrong with my leg
Just B-boy limpin'

01:04:39.338 --> 01:04:41.423
Got arrested at the Mardi Gras
For jumping on a float

01:04:41.507 --> 01:04:44.176
My man MCA's
Got a beard like a billy goat

01:04:44.259 --> 01:04:46.261
Ooh, ooh, is my disco call

01:04:46.345 --> 01:04:48.889
MCA, I'm gettin' rope y'all

01:04:52.684 --> 01:04:53.810
Now...

01:04:57.981 --> 01:05:01.026
I remember one night,
up at the Grasshoff house,

01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:05.280
Yauch was playing mixes of what
we were working on super, super loud.

01:05:05.364 --> 01:05:09.201
And we were looking out all over
the twinkling lights of Los Angeles below,

01:05:09.284 --> 01:05:12.120
and, well, we were
pretty stoned at the time.

01:05:12.204 --> 01:05:17.251
And Yauch turns to me and he goes,
"Yo, this is dope."

01:05:17.334 --> 01:05:22.089
And I elegantly replied,
"Yeah, this is pretty special, dude."

01:05:23.924 --> 01:05:25.259
I mean, it was, actually.

01:05:25.342 --> 01:05:29.346
I mean, because around this time,
Yauch got loose creatively.

01:05:29.429 --> 01:05:34.142
Now, without Rick and Russell around,
we were doing everything ourselves.

01:05:34.226 --> 01:05:37.688
See, a band's got a lot more to do
than just write a song and put it out.

01:05:37.771 --> 01:05:39.523
Like photo shoots,
press photos or whatnot.

01:05:39.606 --> 01:05:41.191
Like, after Licensed to Ill came out,

01:05:41.275 --> 01:05:43.610
the last thing we wanted to do
was some weird photo session

01:05:43.694 --> 01:05:45.445
with some stranger we didn't know.

01:05:45.529 --> 01:05:48.323
So Yauch had this idea. He's telling us,
"We'll do the pictures ourselves.

01:05:48.407 --> 01:05:51.451
You take this little, like, squeezy thing
and you connect to the camera,

01:05:51.535 --> 01:05:52.578
then we take our"--

01:05:52.661 --> 01:05:54.788
This here, right?

01:05:54.872 --> 01:05:56.039
I love that picture of you, Mike.

01:05:56.748 --> 01:05:57.958
Thank you.

01:05:58.041 --> 01:06:00.794
So then we had to make a record cover.
Of course, Yauch's like,

01:06:00.878 --> 01:06:06.675
"Simple. We're gonna use this camera
that takes a 360-degree picture

01:06:06.758 --> 01:06:08.510
and that's gonna be the album cover."

01:06:08.594 --> 01:06:12.097
Okay, here's the thing.
We're together every single day, always.

01:06:12.181 --> 01:06:17.060
So, like, Yauch would just know about
all these things and we're always like,

01:06:17.144 --> 01:06:18.145
"That's cool."

01:06:18.228 --> 01:06:20.731
"How the fuck does he know about that?
That's just so weird."

01:06:21.732 --> 01:06:23.817
Again, usually when you put out a record,

01:06:23.901 --> 01:06:29.031
the fancy record company
assigns you to a big-time fancy director.

01:06:29.114 --> 01:06:32.075
But, of course with us, like,
we were pretty paranoid at the time.

01:06:32.159 --> 01:06:34.411
We didn't trust anybody,
so Yauch was like,

01:06:34.494 --> 01:06:35.871
"No, no, we're gonna get my uncle,

01:06:35.954 --> 01:06:38.874
the legendary Swiss filmmaker
Nathaniel Hörnblowér.

01:06:38.957 --> 01:06:40.876
He's gonna come over,
he's gonna help us out,

01:06:40.959 --> 01:06:43.462
and he's gonna direct all of our videos."

01:06:44.671 --> 01:06:47.424
Yauch's humble about this, right?
Like, he credited his uncle

01:06:47.508 --> 01:06:50.511
for a lot of the experimentation
and for the direction.

01:06:50.594 --> 01:06:52.471
But, like, Yauch was the driving force.

01:06:54.306 --> 01:06:56.642
Actually, in the
"Looking Down the Barrel of a Gun" video,

01:06:56.725 --> 01:06:59.561
that stuff is just really us
wearing Madilyn Grasshoff's clothes.

01:06:59.645 --> 01:07:02.022
That was one day that we just
put on a bunch of her clothes

01:07:02.105 --> 01:07:04.358
and just went and drove around
and videotaped ourselves.

01:07:04.441 --> 01:07:07.027
So thanks, Madilyn, for the solid.

01:07:07.945 --> 01:07:10.280
Steal from the rich
And I'm out robbing banks

01:07:10.364 --> 01:07:12.449
Give it to the poor
And I always give thanks

01:07:12.533 --> 01:07:15.285
Because I got more stories
Than J.D.'s got Salinger

01:07:15.369 --> 01:07:17.538
-I hold the title
-And you are the challenger

01:07:17.621 --> 01:07:19.665
Hörnblowér was around a lot at the time,

01:07:19.748 --> 01:07:22.543
which was kinda cool
'cause he was Yauch's uncle,

01:07:22.626 --> 01:07:25.796
but like, he was a fucking drunk, Mike.
I don't know how else to say it.

01:07:25.879 --> 01:07:27.172
He liked his wineskin, yeah.

01:07:27.256 --> 01:07:29.049
So we're all doing our thing
and then there's, like,

01:07:29.132 --> 01:07:32.636
this weird old Swiss guy
just crashed out on the couch.

01:07:32.719 --> 01:07:36.181
Look. This is what we used to
have to deal with, with Yauch's uncle.

01:07:36.265 --> 01:07:38.308
Yeah, this is a little strange for me,

01:07:38.392 --> 01:07:41.937
because I'm not used to
being on this side of the camera.

01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:45.566
I'm preferred to be behind it.

01:07:47.526 --> 01:07:49.152
You're certainly dressed for the part.

01:07:49.236 --> 01:07:52.406
This is our traditional clothing
from where I'm from.

01:07:52.489 --> 01:07:54.449
And you may joke about it,

01:07:54.533 --> 01:07:59.246
but I may joke about you walking
around in a business suit someplace,

01:07:59.329 --> 01:08:01.415
and maybe that's silly to me, okay?

01:08:01.498 --> 01:08:03.417
Maybe I'm laughing at you right now.

01:08:05.919 --> 01:08:10.007
Somehow, between the weed,
the breakfast, the parties,

01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:13.594
we finish the record
and the artwork and we hand it all in.

01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:18.432
Like this.

01:08:18.515 --> 01:08:20.850
So, we were excited.

01:08:20.934 --> 01:08:23.312
We finished this record
we were really proud of.

01:08:23.395 --> 01:08:25.397
People were gonna buy it and hear it

01:08:25.479 --> 01:08:27.357
and see that we were more than just those

01:08:27.441 --> 01:08:29.318
"Fight for Your Right (To Party)"
guys, right?

01:08:29.401 --> 01:08:32.237
You think we would've been humbled
by the falling out with Def Jam.

01:08:32.321 --> 01:08:33.529
-No.
-But no.

01:08:33.613 --> 01:08:34.781
We were on top of the world.

01:08:34.865 --> 01:08:37.618
Yo, what's up?
It's the Beastie Boys for Yo! MTV Raps.

01:08:37.701 --> 01:08:38.577
Boy!

01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:40.787
Girl, you know it's true

01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:45.082
Mike D is in love with you

01:08:45.167 --> 01:08:46.710
In the lead-up to the record release,

01:08:46.792 --> 01:08:47.961
we were doing loads of interviews.

01:08:48.045 --> 01:08:50.255
I mean, shit, we were ready
to play Madison Square Garden

01:08:50.339 --> 01:08:51.965
and blow the fuck up.

01:08:53.591 --> 01:08:55.844
And Capitol Records were all in.

01:08:55.928 --> 01:08:57.679
They were maybe even
more amped than we were.

01:08:57.763 --> 01:08:59.055
The Beasties are not

01:09:00.557 --> 01:09:02.643
concept masterminded by someone else.

01:09:03.644 --> 01:09:07.189
And the extraordinary success of their
first album, Licensed to Ill,

01:09:07.272 --> 01:09:08.273
was no fluke.

01:09:09.858 --> 01:09:11.902
Word on the street from respected rappers,

01:09:11.984 --> 01:09:15.572
from Eazy-E to MC Hammer to Public Enemy,

01:09:15.656 --> 01:09:17.866
is that these guys are real indeed.

01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:19.618
The music is stupid fresh.

01:09:20.786 --> 01:09:21.995
They have the stuff.

01:09:22.955 --> 01:09:24.162
So enough talk.

01:09:24.872 --> 01:09:26.917
Let's raise the flag up the pole.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.210
Batman, watch out.

01:09:28.877 --> 01:09:31.587
The Beasties are gonna be
in your face this summer.

01:09:32.214 --> 01:09:36.844
And then, on July 25th, 1989...

01:09:36.926 --> 01:09:39.220
With the entire world waiting...

01:09:39.888 --> 01:09:43.934
Our new record,
Paul's Boutique, comes out, and...

01:09:47.479 --> 01:09:48.479
nothing.

01:09:50.107 --> 01:09:51.108
Crickets.

01:09:53.109 --> 01:09:55.612
Chapter 7: "Crickets."

01:09:57.155 --> 01:10:00.868
No radio was playing the new songs.
No MTVs playing the new video.

01:10:00.951 --> 01:10:02.911
No shows. Nobody gave a shit.

01:10:02.995 --> 01:10:04.121
They all moved on.

01:10:04.788 --> 01:10:07.082
It felt like we were a haircut
that they got in the seventh grade

01:10:07.165 --> 01:10:09.585
and thought was really cool,
but now they were embarrassed about it

01:10:09.668 --> 01:10:11.712
and just wanted to pretend
it never happened.

01:10:11.795 --> 01:10:13.714
I remember being really surprised

01:10:13.797 --> 01:10:17.384
that Paul's Boutique didn't do better
than it did when it came out,

01:10:17.467 --> 01:10:20.470
because I kept feeling
while we were working on it

01:10:20.554 --> 01:10:22.931
like it was so much better of a record
than Licensed to Ill.

01:10:23.015 --> 01:10:25.142
When we were working on
Paul's Boutique, I just kept thinking,

01:10:25.225 --> 01:10:26.476
"Wow, this sounds so much better.

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:29.229
I would imagine this is gonna do,
like, much better than that."

01:10:29.313 --> 01:10:33.108
So when it didn't, then I was kinda like,
"Well, you never know."

01:10:33.192 --> 01:10:35.402
So now I don't even
try and guess these days.

01:10:35.485 --> 01:10:38.572
Nobody cared that we had a new record out.

01:10:39.114 --> 01:10:45.204
No one, that is, except for
our dear old friend Mr. Don Cornelius.

01:10:45.287 --> 01:10:47.372
Beasties, Beasties.

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:48.999
How you doing, gentlemen?

01:10:49.082 --> 01:10:50.417
-What's up, Don?
-All right.

01:10:50.501 --> 01:10:51.710
-Hi.
-Hey, Don.

01:10:51.793 --> 01:10:53.378
-Yo, what's up, man?
-What's up?

01:10:54.338 --> 01:10:55.964
-What's up, Don?
-All right.

01:10:56.048 --> 01:10:57.508
-Yeah. Okay.
-Peace.

01:10:57.591 --> 01:10:59.092
To you too, brother.

01:10:59.176 --> 01:11:01.303
Hey, man, what is "the Don Cornelius"?

01:11:01.386 --> 01:11:03.847
-Don Cornelius.
-You made it up, man.

01:11:03.931 --> 01:11:05.724
-You're the man.
-Don Cornelius.

01:11:05.807 --> 01:11:09.770
Yo, but seriously, we just wanna say
we've been on the show before, whatever,

01:11:09.853 --> 01:11:12.189
but we've been watching this show since--

01:11:12.272 --> 01:11:15.317
You know, a lot of people don't realize,
since whatever, since we were kids.

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:16.527
That's how long.

01:11:16.610 --> 01:11:19.029
You know,
I got the Soul Train albums here.

01:11:19.112 --> 01:11:21.114
Whenever you're in town,

01:11:21.198 --> 01:11:23.575
you know, always make this a stop, okay?

01:11:23.659 --> 01:11:24.660
-All right, man.
-All right.

01:11:24.743 --> 01:11:27.079
The Beastie Boys!

01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:32.209
You threatened Don Cornelius.
You got right in his--

01:11:32.292 --> 01:11:33.293
Can we show that again?

01:11:33.377 --> 01:11:36.296
You know,
I got the Soul Train albums here.

01:11:36.839 --> 01:11:38.131
Why, Mike?

01:11:38.423 --> 01:11:41.969
I'm wearing, like,
some kind of blouse, dude, okay?

01:11:42.052 --> 01:11:44.429
It looks like you don't even know
how to wear a shirt.

01:11:45.973 --> 01:11:49.351
We look like four different people
in four different bands.

01:11:49.810 --> 01:11:52.104
Now, I just want to point out, Adam,

01:11:52.187 --> 01:11:53.605
not to go in too hard,

01:11:53.689 --> 01:11:58.569
but it looks like you're about to throw up
on DJ Hurricane's shoulder right there.

01:11:58.652 --> 01:12:00.112
You're not doing too good.

01:12:00.195 --> 01:12:02.447
I think I was either
about to fall asleep or cry.

01:12:03.615 --> 01:12:08.120
And I have to apologize right now
to Mr. Don Cornelius,

01:12:08.203 --> 01:12:13.709
because obviously I'm being
very unnecessarily aggressive towards him.

01:12:14.251 --> 01:12:17.754
I guess whatever I smoked is, like,
the stuff that makes you, like--

01:12:17.838 --> 01:12:21.383
I don't know, look at your best friend
and just, like, punch him in the gut

01:12:21.466 --> 01:12:23.051
and then knee him in the nuts.

01:12:25.304 --> 01:12:26.597
Like the mad, aggressive strain.

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:29.725
Christ, Mike.
It's very-- It's very specific.

01:12:29.808 --> 01:12:33.312
I think the one I smoked,
it must have been called Steven Seagal.

01:12:36.106 --> 01:12:37.524
You guys.

01:12:37.608 --> 01:12:42.738
Footnote: In, like, 1988,
we went to see Jimmy Cliff play.

01:12:43.363 --> 01:12:46.116
And we're super stoned
in the back of the thing,

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:47.743
and in the middle of
the Jimmy Cliff show--

01:12:47.826 --> 01:12:51.830
It's like summertime, outdoor show.
Stops the song, and he's like, "Right now,

01:12:51.914 --> 01:12:55.584
I wanna bring out to the stage
a great, great actor.

01:12:55.667 --> 01:12:57.169
Mr. Steven Seagal."

01:12:57.252 --> 01:12:58.420
He was a little more like,

01:12:58.504 --> 01:13:01.673
"Right now, great, great actor!"

01:13:02.007 --> 01:13:03.425
You had to do the Jamaican accent.

01:13:03.759 --> 01:13:06.887
And fucking Steven Seagal comes out,
in like a full ninja outfit,

01:13:06.970 --> 01:13:09.264
and starts banging on the timbales
and then leaves.

01:13:09.348 --> 01:13:10.974
Yup. And you know what, Adam?

01:13:11.058 --> 01:13:13.101
That was some crazy shit.

01:13:13.185 --> 01:13:14.561
Cra-Cra-Cra--

01:13:17.481 --> 01:13:18.815
Crazy shit.

01:13:19.983 --> 01:13:21.944
Crazy shit.

01:13:22.027 --> 01:13:22.903
Crazy shit.

01:13:24.404 --> 01:13:27.324
Is that just not funny?
I don't know what-- It's not funny.

01:13:27.407 --> 01:13:28.784
I think we were right to cut it.

01:13:28.867 --> 01:13:30.494
Yeah, yeah. I think so. We'll cut it.

01:13:31.828 --> 01:13:35.374
All right. So we clearly were a mess
right at this point, right?

01:13:35.457 --> 01:13:36.667
Definitely.

01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:41.255
So putting all your efforts, your time,
your excitement into something

01:13:41.338 --> 01:13:42.756
and hearing crickets...

01:13:43.298 --> 01:13:44.716
I was a little crushed.

01:13:45.133 --> 01:13:48.011
I mean, we're all ready
to have Paul's Boutique blow up.

01:13:48.262 --> 01:13:51.056
And it came and went,
and it was kind of sobering.

01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:58.814
Yo, what's up? Mike D here, what's up?

01:13:59.773 --> 01:14:00.899
Oh, hello, my friend.

01:14:00.983 --> 01:14:03.443
It's Bill Harper, your accountant.

01:14:03.527 --> 01:14:05.362
Oh, shit. What's up, homes?
How you feeling?

01:14:05.445 --> 01:14:07.489
I need to discuss some things with you.

01:14:07.573 --> 01:14:10.325
As it turns out,
your financial picture has changed a bit.

01:14:10.409 --> 01:14:13.120
Seems you guys
don't really have any money anymore.

01:14:13.203 --> 01:14:14.288
What?

01:14:14.371 --> 01:14:17.875
You see, my friend Mike D,
you guys went to LA, you moved there,

01:14:17.958 --> 01:14:21.503
you rent this crazy house with
a fucking bridge over a swimming pool,

01:14:21.587 --> 01:14:23.422
you get these crazy expensive cars,

01:14:23.505 --> 01:14:26.425
you spend millions of dollars
at crazy-expensive studios.

01:14:26.508 --> 01:14:27.509
That was for work though.

01:14:27.593 --> 01:14:31.555
You spend fucking $4,200
on fucking almond milk a week.

01:14:31.638 --> 01:14:32.639
Also for work.

01:14:32.723 --> 01:14:36.185
And you know what happens?
You go fucking broke.

01:14:36.268 --> 01:14:38.478
Shit, Bill. That sucks.

01:14:38.854 --> 01:14:39.897
Yeah, it does.

01:14:40.397 --> 01:14:41.356
Hey, I gotta go, Mike.

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.650
I got Donny Osmond on the other line.

01:14:46.570 --> 01:14:49.698
Now we call this time period
Paul's Purgatory.

01:14:51.575 --> 01:14:53.744
But the good news is

01:14:53.827 --> 01:14:56.455
we signed a multi-record deal
with Capitol,

01:14:56.538 --> 01:14:58.498
so whether they liked it or not,

01:14:58.582 --> 01:15:02.419
they had to give us the money
to make another record.

01:15:02.836 --> 01:15:05.672
But we had to downsize a little bit.

01:15:05.839 --> 01:15:07.841
We had wasted all this money

01:15:07.925 --> 01:15:11.011
recording Paul's Boutique
at these fancy studios.

01:15:11.094 --> 01:15:12.721
So we figured, "Fuck it.

01:15:12.804 --> 01:15:15.933
Let's take the money for the record,
build our own studio,

01:15:16.016 --> 01:15:17.601
and we'd save a whole lot."

01:15:17.976 --> 01:15:21.271
We found this old Elks Lodge ballroom
in Atwater,

01:15:21.355 --> 01:15:23.357
this sleepy part of Los Angeles,

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.776
where nothing was happening, right?

01:15:25.859 --> 01:15:29.071
We built a bare-bones recording studio
with a basketball hoop

01:15:29.154 --> 01:15:31.073
and Yauch made a skate ramp.

01:15:31.156 --> 01:15:34.076
We wanted to start playing
more and more of our own music again,

01:15:34.159 --> 01:15:36.578
even if we didn't know
what that meant at first.

01:15:36.912 --> 01:15:38.497
So we moved out of that Grasshoff house.

01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:40.832
We each got much cheaper places to live.

01:15:40.916 --> 01:15:44.378
I mean, shit, Yauch was living
in a fucking log cabin.

01:15:44.628 --> 01:15:45.754
Right? For real.

01:15:45.838 --> 01:15:47.714
We definitely downsized.

01:15:48.465 --> 01:15:51.927
But like always, we wanted to do
what we always do:

01:15:52.386 --> 01:15:54.805
Just make music, hang out, bullshit.

01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:57.266
But this time
we wanted to do it differently.

01:15:57.766 --> 01:16:00.102
We figured instead of just sampling
music that we love,

01:16:00.185 --> 01:16:02.312
why not try playing it
with our instruments?

01:16:02.396 --> 01:16:05.607
I mean, shit, why not try to sound
like The Meters?

01:16:07.484 --> 01:16:09.069
We sucked at first.

01:16:09.152 --> 01:16:11.947
I was a punk guitar player.
Now I'm trying to play jazz and soul.

01:16:12.030 --> 01:16:13.532
It wasn't pretty.

01:16:14.074 --> 01:16:16.493
-I mean, Mike was decent on the drums.
-Thank you.

01:16:16.577 --> 01:16:18.996
But Yauch goes and buys an acoustic bass

01:16:19.079 --> 01:16:20.873
and just magically knew how to play it.

01:16:21.582 --> 01:16:24.501
Like-- I don't know if you've ever tried
to play one of those things,

01:16:24.585 --> 01:16:25.919
but it's really fucking hard.

01:16:26.003 --> 01:16:30.132
So our new routine was to show up
at our clubhouse every day

01:16:30.215 --> 01:16:34.136
and play music with our friends
Money Mark and Mario C.

01:16:34.428 --> 01:16:37.097
We met Mario C.
working on Paul's Boutique.

01:16:37.347 --> 01:16:39.099
He was the Dust Brothers' engineer,

01:16:39.183 --> 01:16:41.476
and we asked him
to help us build our studio.

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:44.938
And we ended up getting him to stay
and make music with us.

01:16:45.105 --> 01:16:48.108
Now, when we were staying at
that crazy expensive house in Hollywood,

01:16:48.192 --> 01:16:50.485
Mike crashed his car
into the driveway gate.

01:16:50.569 --> 01:16:51.612
True.

01:16:51.695 --> 01:16:54.573
But Mario had a friend
who was a carpenter, Mark Nishita,

01:16:54.656 --> 01:16:55.782
and he came over to fix it.

01:16:55.866 --> 01:16:59.328
But Mario said he's also
this really great keyboard player.

01:16:59.411 --> 01:17:01.830
So when we got our studio
and started playing,

01:17:01.914 --> 01:17:05.667
we asked him to come help us
make our sound more funky.

01:17:05.751 --> 01:17:06.835
Turn that up a little bit.

01:17:11.798 --> 01:17:14.384
So that's Yauch on the bass.
I'm on the guitar.

01:17:14.468 --> 01:17:17.596
Listen to that guitar, Adam.
Your guitar break.

01:17:17.679 --> 01:17:19.848
You got some high-hat patterns, Mike.

01:17:21.225 --> 01:17:24.311
Mark's on the organ. I mean,
we're getting it together, right, Mike?

01:17:30.734 --> 01:17:33.529
So this went on for a year or so,
and we couldn't have been happier.

01:17:34.321 --> 01:17:37.157
We're learning how to play our instruments
and we're chopping up samples.

01:17:37.241 --> 01:17:38.825
We're making beats we were into.

01:17:38.909 --> 01:17:41.286
We were making music
we really liked.

01:17:42.037 --> 01:17:45.249
The only problem was
we weren't finishing any songs.

01:17:46.416 --> 01:17:48.794
When it came time
to do vocals on a song,

01:17:48.877 --> 01:17:50.712
we'd get hesitant and shy.

01:17:50.796 --> 01:17:52.047
We'd been in a weird headspace,

01:17:52.130 --> 01:17:55.008
just kind of confused with
what our voices were.

01:17:55.092 --> 01:17:57.052
What should our vocals even sound like?

01:17:57.511 --> 01:18:00.597
We think we're rappers, because
our first two albums were rap albums.

01:18:00.848 --> 01:18:03.475
But what were we gonna rap about?

01:18:03.559 --> 01:18:04.935
We didn't feel like we're the guys

01:18:05.018 --> 01:18:07.729
who made
Licensed to Ill or Paul's Boutique.

01:18:07.938 --> 01:18:10.649
But we didn't know exactly
where that left us.

01:18:13.527 --> 01:18:15.487
And then one morning I was at home

01:18:15.571 --> 01:18:18.615
and I got woken up by the kind of call
I never got before.

01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:22.035
A call from a friend's parent,
crying on the phone.

01:18:23.579 --> 01:18:25.289
Our friend Dave Scilken's dad called

01:18:25.372 --> 01:18:27.291
and told me that Dave had died
of an overdose.

01:18:27.666 --> 01:18:29.084
He was 20 years old.

01:18:30.919 --> 01:18:33.172
I hadn't really lost
a close friend like that.

01:18:34.381 --> 01:18:37.509
People on our periphery,
but no one that close.

01:18:38.010 --> 01:18:39.636
This felt really different.

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:41.221
David Scilken.

01:18:42.389 --> 01:18:44.975
We all went back to New York
for Dave's service.

01:18:45.058 --> 01:18:46.643
-Say hi, Dave.
-Hi.

01:18:47.186 --> 01:18:48.437
It was just so fucking sad.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.898
Yo, this is Dave Scilken.
This is Shadi One.

01:18:51.815 --> 01:18:54.109
Afterwards, we all ended up at some bar,

01:18:54.193 --> 01:18:56.653
'cause that's just what you do
when a friend passes away.

01:18:56.737 --> 01:19:00.240
You get beers and sit around
and tell stories about them.

01:19:01.658 --> 01:19:03.243
Now we felt a little self-conscious

01:19:03.327 --> 01:19:04.995
when we ran into old friends at that time.

01:19:05.704 --> 01:19:08.624
We thought when they'd see us, they'd see
the "Fight for Your Right (To Party)" guys

01:19:08.707 --> 01:19:10.209
and would be jerks about it.

01:19:10.667 --> 01:19:12.836
But it wasn't like that with Kate
and all our old friends.

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:15.422
We just sat around
and missed our friend Dave.

01:19:15.506 --> 01:19:18.467
And it meant a lot more to the three of us
than we realized.

01:19:19.009 --> 01:19:21.303
There was a reason
that we'd all been friends.

01:19:22.012 --> 01:19:24.723
And the whole trip was like a connection
to New York City.

01:19:26.350 --> 01:19:28.519
And it felt good
to be with everybody again.

01:19:28.602 --> 01:19:33.065
Kills himself and

01:19:33.148 --> 01:19:38.612
How do I make friends now

01:19:39.321 --> 01:19:40.739
As sad as this all was,

01:19:40.822 --> 01:19:43.075
we went back to our clubhouse in LA.

01:19:43.534 --> 01:19:45.702
And I don't know if it was
meeting up with our friends

01:19:45.786 --> 01:19:49.039
or having our lives switched up,
but we got inspired.

01:19:49.122 --> 01:19:51.708
And all of a sudden,
we started finishing shit.

01:19:55.921 --> 01:19:58.006
And it gave us this sense of, like,

01:19:58.090 --> 01:19:59.675
just keep doing what you're doing.

01:19:59.967 --> 01:20:02.177
Our music could include
everything we loved,

01:20:02.261 --> 01:20:05.347
and our album could be like a mixtape
of all different types of music,

01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:08.058
including any sounds
or dialogue or samples

01:20:08.141 --> 01:20:09.685
or anything that we thought was funny.

01:20:10.143 --> 01:20:13.438
When you're 22, you don't know
what to do with your feelings.

01:20:13.522 --> 01:20:16.483
We couldn't articulate it to each other
how we felt.

01:20:16.567 --> 01:20:18.902
But I do think that
having all of those feelings

01:20:18.986 --> 01:20:20.654
and not knowing what to do with them,

01:20:20.737 --> 01:20:23.198
you kind of just put it
into whatever you're making.

01:20:23.574 --> 01:20:25.951
People, how you doin'
There's a new day dawnin'

01:20:26.034 --> 01:20:28.370
For the earth mother
It's a brand new mornin'

01:20:28.453 --> 01:20:30.789
For such a long while
There's been such a longin'

01:20:30.873 --> 01:20:33.250
But now the sun is shinin'
Let's roll back the awnin'

01:20:38.297 --> 01:20:40.716
This is a type of kinda
Like a formal dedication

01:20:40.799 --> 01:20:43.093
Givin' out a shout
For much inspiration

01:20:43.177 --> 01:20:45.262
All I ever really want to do
Is get nice

01:20:45.345 --> 01:20:47.723
Get loose
And goof a little slice of life

01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:50.434
Sendin' out love
To all corners of the land

01:20:50.517 --> 01:20:52.561
I jump up on the stage
And take the mic in my hand

01:20:52.644 --> 01:20:55.355
I'm not playin' the role
Just bein' who I am

01:20:55.439 --> 01:20:57.691
And if you try to dis me
I couldn't give a damn

01:20:59.276 --> 01:21:01.987
Yo, we were like, "Fuck it," right?

01:21:03.739 --> 01:21:04.948
I mean--

01:21:05.908 --> 01:21:07.326
We should make whatever we like.

01:21:07.409 --> 01:21:10.621
I mean, if The Clash have punk and reggae
and rap songs on their records,

01:21:10.704 --> 01:21:11.830
why can't we?

01:21:11.914 --> 01:21:14.833
I mean, why not a stoner song
next to a rap song

01:21:14.917 --> 01:21:16.627
next to a hardcore song?

01:21:25.093 --> 01:21:26.970
This is our song "Time for Livin'."

01:21:27.346 --> 01:21:31.225
We just wanted to experiment and do all
different types of shit that we could do.

01:21:31.433 --> 01:21:33.644
We played our instruments
and we sampled that.

01:21:33.727 --> 01:21:35.229
We'd never done that before.

01:21:35.312 --> 01:21:39.733
And while experimenting, we gave ourselves
permission to do stuff like sing.

01:21:41.485 --> 01:21:43.111
We'd never done that either.

01:21:43.195 --> 01:21:45.572
But we were like, "Fuck it. Let's try it."

01:21:45.656 --> 01:21:49.701
There's something
Coming to the surface

01:21:51.662 --> 01:21:54.206
There's fire all around

01:21:55.374 --> 01:21:57.960
But this is all illusion

01:21:58.043 --> 01:22:00.170
This song's called
"Something's Got to Give."

01:22:00.254 --> 01:22:03.090
Yauch wrote the lyrics,
which are about change and growth.

01:22:03.173 --> 01:22:07.094
And that makes sense, because right around
this time, Yauch was exploring everything.

01:22:07.469 --> 01:22:10.180
There was no boundary
he wasn't interested in crossing.

01:22:10.973 --> 01:22:13.642
Like calling me at fucking
4:30 in the morning, being like,

01:22:13.725 --> 01:22:15.477
"I'm recording these pigeons.
You gotta hear 'em."

01:22:15.561 --> 01:22:16.979
I'm like, "Dude, I'm sleeping."

01:22:17.646 --> 01:22:19.106
That's not what we're talking about.

01:22:20.315 --> 01:22:22.442
I'm saying he was
in full-on transformation mode.

01:22:22.901 --> 01:22:24.152
He was traveling the world,

01:22:24.236 --> 01:22:27.197
he was snowboarding out of helicopters,
he was trekking in Nepal.

01:22:28.198 --> 01:22:30.659
Whatever it was, he went out
and found out about it.

01:22:31.285 --> 01:22:33.996
Film, Buddhism, music,

01:22:34.663 --> 01:22:37.249
meeting people everywhere
from all different worlds.

01:22:38.208 --> 01:22:41.545
If you can feel what I'm feeling
Then it's a musical masterpiece...

01:22:44.089 --> 01:22:46.842
What's running through my mind
Comes through in my walk

01:22:46.925 --> 01:22:49.553
True feelings are shown
From the way that I talk...

01:22:49.636 --> 01:22:53.557
So after two full years
of being immersed in our clubhouse,

01:22:54.266 --> 01:22:56.435
we finished our record Check Your Head.

01:22:59.396 --> 01:23:02.858
Chapter 8: "The Record
That Changed Everything."

01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:07.112
We were really psyched on Check Your Head,

01:23:07.446 --> 01:23:11.867
and we wanted to go out and play shows,
so we found a new manager, John Silva.

01:23:12.951 --> 01:23:16.413
Now, he told us that if we were serious
about going on tour,

01:23:16.496 --> 01:23:19.499
we'd have to bust our asses
playing tons of clubs

01:23:19.583 --> 01:23:23.921
and work super hard to try and build it
back up to playing bigger places.

01:23:24.379 --> 01:23:25.672
He was honest with us.

01:23:25.756 --> 01:23:30.302
And he was right, 'cause not that many
people gave a shit about us at the time.

01:23:30.385 --> 01:23:32.054
And he's still our manager today.

01:23:32.387 --> 01:23:33.222
So...

01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:39.186
Good news-- Good news,
we now had our squad to go on tour.

01:23:40.062 --> 01:23:43.273
Bad news, we had to do a ton of work.

01:23:48.362 --> 01:23:50.614
Tumble outta bed
And I stumble to the kitchen

01:23:50.697 --> 01:23:52.699
Pour myself a cup of ambition

01:23:52.783 --> 01:23:55.702
And yawn and stretch
And try to come to life

01:23:57.746 --> 01:24:00.165
Jump in the shower
And the blood starts pumpin'

01:24:00.249 --> 01:24:02.209
Out on the street
The traffic starts jumpin'

01:24:02.292 --> 01:24:06.380
With folks like me on the job
From 9 to 5

01:24:06.463 --> 01:24:11.176
Workin' 9 to 5
What a way to make a livin'

01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:15.889
Barely gettin' by
It's all takin' and no givin'

01:24:15.973 --> 01:24:20.352
They just use your mind
And they never give you credit

01:24:20.435 --> 01:24:25.232
It's enough to drive you
Crazy if you let it...

01:24:25.983 --> 01:24:29.361
So five years earlier,
we're at Madison Square Garden, right?

01:24:29.444 --> 01:24:31.738
-Oh, yeah.
-And now we're playing clubs.

01:24:31.989 --> 01:24:36.201
You'd think we'd be bummed out about it,
but actually, falling off can be fun.

01:24:36.827 --> 01:24:39.371
Even though we're playing
to just a couple hundred people,

01:24:39.746 --> 01:24:40.831
those shows were packed.

01:24:41.456 --> 01:24:44.251
The crowd was way different now
than it was in '87.

01:24:44.668 --> 01:24:46.962
Licensed to Ill was, like, arena rock.

01:24:47.045 --> 01:24:51.300
The shows in '92 were packed
with like-minded weirdos.

01:24:51.383 --> 01:24:52.843
People we felt connected to.

01:24:53.218 --> 01:24:55.220
I mean, we were playing shows for people

01:24:55.304 --> 01:24:56.930
we would actually wanna hang out with.

01:24:57.306 --> 01:25:00.559
But we were still figuring out
how to be this new version of our band,

01:25:00.976 --> 01:25:04.813
and after a year of playing shows,
we started to know what we were doing.

01:25:04.897 --> 01:25:07.774
It wasn't until, like, the end
of the Check Your Head tour

01:25:07.858 --> 01:25:12.070
that I actually and confidently
considered myself to be a musician.

01:25:18.118 --> 01:25:22.497
So we'd just spent a year touring
and we started recording again.

01:25:22.581 --> 01:25:26.001
We were having so much fun being together
and playing music together,

01:25:26.084 --> 01:25:27.085
why stop?

01:25:27.419 --> 01:25:31.423
It was almost like Check Your Head
and Ill Communication were one thing,

01:25:31.507 --> 01:25:33.634
and we just kept going and going.

01:25:34.218 --> 01:25:37.179
I mean, we were psyched
to go into the studio every night.

01:25:37.513 --> 01:25:40.307
All of our friends would come through,
and they'd hang out.

01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:43.685
I mean, shit,
we had a basketball court and a half-pipe.

01:25:43.769 --> 01:25:45.896
I mean, not to mention tons of music gear.

01:25:46.772 --> 01:25:48.941
So many amazing people would stop by.

01:25:49.233 --> 01:25:54.821
Q-Tip played basketball, and he recorded
a verse on a song, "Get It Together."

01:25:55.447 --> 01:25:58.617
Christian Hosoi and Jason Lee,
they'd come over to skate.

01:25:59.034 --> 01:26:00.786
Biz Markie would come over a lot.

01:26:01.203 --> 01:26:03.705
Now one day our old friend Jill Cunniff

01:26:03.789 --> 01:26:07.543
called me and asked to listen to the demo
tape of her band Luscious Jackson.

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:08.877
Yauch--

01:26:10.963 --> 01:26:11.964
Yauch was like,

01:26:12.047 --> 01:26:15.259
"This is awesome. We should just
start a record label and put it out."

01:26:15.342 --> 01:26:17.427
Now we have a record label, Grand Royal.

01:26:17.511 --> 01:26:21.223
The music was amazing,
and what made it even more special to us,

01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:25.018
Kate joined Luscious Jackson
when they went out to play shows.

01:26:25.519 --> 01:26:28.605
So ten years later
we're back in each other's lives.

01:26:32.150 --> 01:26:35.779
So all this stuff was happening
under one roof, G-Son, our studio.

01:26:36.238 --> 01:26:38.323
Now one day I walked in,

01:26:38.407 --> 01:26:41.076
and I heard Yauch playing
this awesome bass line.

01:26:41.159 --> 01:26:44.538
It was so good, it seemed like
it must've been a song already.

01:26:44.621 --> 01:26:47.124
I was like, "Yo, Yauch. What is that?"

01:26:47.958 --> 01:26:50.377
And he was like,
"It's ours. I just wrote it."

01:26:50.752 --> 01:26:53.422
So I sat down.
I start playing drums with him.

01:27:00.637 --> 01:27:04.141
Then Keyboard Money Mark sits down.
He starts playing the organ.

01:27:04.224 --> 01:27:07.227
And then Adam puts on his guitar.
He starts to play.

01:27:07.311 --> 01:27:09.688
We made a quick arrangement
and we recorded it.

01:27:10.105 --> 01:27:12.065
It was the fastest song we'd ever made,

01:27:12.441 --> 01:27:14.818
and it was kind of
our favorite instrumental we had.

01:27:14.902 --> 01:27:16.445
But for whatever reason,
it just sat around

01:27:16.528 --> 01:27:18.447
for months and months with no vocals.

01:27:19.031 --> 01:27:20.657
When we were getting ready
to finish the record,

01:27:20.741 --> 01:27:23.076
we knew we had to
do something with that song.

01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:25.746
We tried a bunch of different ideas
to make it a rap song,

01:27:25.829 --> 01:27:26.872
but it wasn't working.

01:27:26.955 --> 01:27:30.417
And I had this idea
that I would go to Mario C.'s house

01:27:30.501 --> 01:27:33.504
and he would record me
screaming a bunch of stuff.

01:27:33.587 --> 01:27:36.840
The lyrics were all about
how Mario was the worst person ever

01:27:36.924 --> 01:27:39.968
and how he was always
sabotaging us and holding us back.

01:27:40.052 --> 01:27:41.845
I thought it would be funny
to stand next to him

01:27:41.929 --> 01:27:43.514
and scream that shit when he recorded it.

01:27:44.056 --> 01:27:47.935
So, so, so, so listen up
'Cause you can't say nothin'

01:27:48.393 --> 01:27:50.562
You'll shut me down
With a push of your button

01:27:50.646 --> 01:27:51.605
But, yo, I'm...

01:27:51.688 --> 01:27:53.774
I had this idea that we should
take some pictures of us

01:27:53.857 --> 01:27:56.193
as undercover cops
eating donuts and shit, right?

01:27:56.610 --> 01:28:00.989
But we were like, "Fuck it.
We should make a video for that instead."

01:28:01.490 --> 01:28:04.201
And Spike came over, and we
played dress-up, like we usually do.

01:28:04.284 --> 01:28:05.827
Just running around like maniacs

01:28:05.911 --> 01:28:09.164
with no proper permits or cops
or fire department or anything.

01:28:09.414 --> 01:28:11.750
'Cause what you see
You might not get

01:28:12.125 --> 01:28:14.962
And we can bet
So don't you get souped yet...

01:28:15.045 --> 01:28:17.756
Scheming on a thing, that's a mirage

01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:20.717
I'm trying to tell you now
It's sabotage

01:28:29.893 --> 01:28:33.188
Well, that changed
everything for us again.

01:28:33.730 --> 01:28:37.067
That summer, we begin headlining
the Lollapalooza tour.

01:28:38.443 --> 01:28:40.571
So, we're in Minnesota.

01:28:40.654 --> 01:28:44.825
We're in this huge field and there's,
like, bonfires off in the distance,

01:28:44.908 --> 01:28:46.702
and people are going crazy.

01:28:46.785 --> 01:28:50.455
And we go back on for our encore,
and we play "Sabotage."

01:28:50.539 --> 01:28:53.959
And a sea of people go next-level crazy.

01:28:54.042 --> 01:28:57.379
We come off the stage,
and we look at each other, and we're like,

01:28:57.462 --> 01:28:59.840
"Wow. We have our new last song."

01:29:02.342 --> 01:29:06.597
And to think all of that came from Yauch
just playing a bass line.

01:29:12.728 --> 01:29:16.356
Now, all of us have been in a room
where a friend of yours, you know,

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:19.443
just kinda says or does something
randomly that seems cool.

01:29:20.194 --> 01:29:23.113
But when one of those things
that doesn't seem like much in the moment

01:29:23.197 --> 01:29:25.741
becomes something
long-lasting and impactful...

01:29:26.909 --> 01:29:28.785
well, that just doesn't happen that often.

01:29:29.119 --> 01:29:31.663
Now, last year
we did a bunch of interviews

01:29:31.747 --> 01:29:33.665
about Beastie Boys Book that we wrote.

01:29:34.041 --> 01:29:35.751
And the thing
that we were most asked about

01:29:35.834 --> 01:29:39.004
were these lyrics that Yauch
had written for a song, "Sure Shot."

01:29:39.296 --> 01:29:41.924
I want to say a little something
That's long overdue

01:29:42.007 --> 01:29:44.134
The disrespect to women
Has got to be through

01:29:44.218 --> 01:29:46.720
To all the mothers and the sisters
And the wives and friends

01:29:46.803 --> 01:29:49.306
I want to offer my love
And respect to the end

01:29:55.646 --> 01:29:59.483
Now, when he said that, it wasn't, like,
some huge, momentous occasion.

01:29:59.566 --> 01:30:02.903
It was just something
that Yauch wrote with some other lyrics

01:30:02.986 --> 01:30:05.155
and said it
when it was his turn on the mic.

01:30:05.572 --> 01:30:08.575
And we were, like,
"Wow. That's cool that he said that."

01:30:09.159 --> 01:30:13.622
Not only did he speak to a lot of people,
he spoke to the two of us.

01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:19.086
So those years recording and touring on
those two records were so important to us.

01:30:19.419 --> 01:30:21.129
We changed directions of our band.

01:30:21.505 --> 01:30:24.299
We changed how we wanted to be
as people and friends.

01:30:24.716 --> 01:30:27.386
We thought about the world
instead of just our world.

01:30:28.512 --> 01:30:30.472
When we were large in 1987,

01:30:30.556 --> 01:30:34.643
we were on American Bandstand
and we did not give a fuck.

01:30:34.726 --> 01:30:38.188
You wake up late for school
Man, you don't wanna go

01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:44.987
We weren't really, like,
working on our craft so much.

01:30:46.947 --> 01:30:51.577
But seven years later, when we played
"Sabotage" at the MTV awards,

01:30:51.827 --> 01:30:53.453
we were locked in.

01:31:33.702 --> 01:31:38.123
Yo, when we would play festivals
or TV shows with other bands on it,

01:31:38.207 --> 01:31:40.375
we looked at that shit like a competition.

01:31:40.459 --> 01:31:41.835
We played to win.

01:31:42.336 --> 01:31:43.879
We said that kinda half joking,

01:31:43.962 --> 01:31:46.965
but, like, kinda half
almost for 100% serious, right?

01:31:47.716 --> 01:31:51.386
I mean, we wanted everyone that watched
that show or went to that festival

01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:53.388
to go home
and tell their friends the next day,

01:31:53.472 --> 01:31:56.225
"Fucking Beastie Boys
housed the set," right?

01:31:56.308 --> 01:31:57.893
We played that shit to win.

01:31:59.269 --> 01:32:03.482
So when we played those MTV awards,
I mean, we won. Yeah, Mike? No?

01:32:03.565 --> 01:32:04.399
-Yes? No?
-Definitely.

01:32:04.483 --> 01:32:05.484
Got the "W," yes?

01:32:05.567 --> 01:32:07.903
No doubt. Pulled down the "W," people.

01:32:08.445 --> 01:32:12.282
But... later that night,
Spike Jonze was nominated

01:32:12.366 --> 01:32:16.078
for best director
for the "Sabotage" video, but didn't win.

01:32:18.455 --> 01:32:22.042
And that's when Yauch's Uncle Hörnblowér
fucking lost it.

01:32:23.585 --> 01:32:26.630
The winner
of best director in a video is...

01:32:30.008 --> 01:32:30.926
Go ahead.

01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:32.261
R.E.M.

01:32:42.563 --> 01:32:48.193
This is an outrage, because
Spike is the director that has just--

01:32:48.277 --> 01:32:51.822
I'm from Switzerland, okay?
Let me just tell everyone that. And--

01:32:53.031 --> 01:32:58.287
And since I was a small boy,
I had dream that Spike would win this.

01:32:59.121 --> 01:33:00.622
And now this has happened,

01:33:00.706 --> 01:33:03.208
and I just wanna tell everyone
that this is a farce.

01:33:03.584 --> 01:33:07.588
That I had all the ideas
for Star Wars and everything.

01:33:13.510 --> 01:33:14.761
Wow.

01:33:18.557 --> 01:33:23.437
Chapter 9:
"I'm Going Back to New York City."

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:26.565
I do believe I've had enough

01:33:28.233 --> 01:33:30.652
So Los Angeles was great for us, right?

01:33:30.736 --> 01:33:33.071
From having houses
with bridges over swimming pools,

01:33:33.530 --> 01:33:36.950
a great studio, making great friends,
making tons of music,

01:33:37.534 --> 01:33:39.661
and actually becoming musicians.

01:33:39.745 --> 01:33:42.247
But we were there for eight years,
and time kinda flew by.

01:33:42.873 --> 01:33:45.417
We were around 30 years old by now,
and we missed home.

01:33:45.501 --> 01:33:47.044
I mean, we missed our families.

01:33:47.127 --> 01:33:49.338
Yauch was the first
to move back to New York.

01:33:49.630 --> 01:33:51.632
He was done
with bouncing around the world,

01:33:51.715 --> 01:33:54.801
and he just wanted to be back
in New York and be a New Yorker.

01:33:55.344 --> 01:33:56.470
Me and Adam soon followed

01:33:56.553 --> 01:33:58.722
so the three of us could pursue
our true passion,

01:33:58.805 --> 01:34:00.098
astrophysics.

01:34:00.766 --> 01:34:02.559
But that didn't really work out.

01:34:03.644 --> 01:34:05.145
Summer of '96.

01:34:05.687 --> 01:34:08.941
We're back home, living a grown-up version
of our high school days.

01:34:09.024 --> 01:34:11.485
Nothing to do but wander around,
trying to link up,

01:34:11.568 --> 01:34:16.031
hanging out with some new friends, hearing
some new music and making new music.

01:34:16.114 --> 01:34:19.493
It's not so much that we settled down.
It's more like we settled in.

01:34:20.077 --> 01:34:22.871
So after a couple years
of doing what we usually do,

01:34:22.955 --> 01:34:27.376
make music, order some food,
bullshit, hang out, make more music,

01:34:27.793 --> 01:34:29.211
we finished a record.

01:34:29.294 --> 01:34:31.880
And maybe our favorite,
'cause it's so experimental.

01:34:32.381 --> 01:34:33.423
Hello Nasty.

01:34:38.303 --> 01:34:42.266
And when we went on tour for that record,
it was the biggest tour we'd ever done.

01:34:42.933 --> 01:34:45.102
It's not that "Fight for Your Right
(To Party)" got erased,

01:34:45.727 --> 01:34:48.105
but at this point,
we were kinda fine without it.

01:34:48.897 --> 01:34:50.732
By that time, we were almost grown-ups.

01:34:51.275 --> 01:34:55.028
The beer and the dick
and the frat dudes were gone.

01:34:55.112 --> 01:34:56.989
You could barely see them anymore.

01:34:57.322 --> 01:34:58.991
By now we were a little older.

01:34:59.074 --> 01:35:02.452
We had other things to do separately,
like grown-up stuff.

01:35:02.536 --> 01:35:04.788
We were in serious relationships,
we had a record label,

01:35:04.872 --> 01:35:06.707
a magazine, a bicycle store,

01:35:06.999 --> 01:35:08.333
but the three of us made a life

01:35:08.417 --> 01:35:11.086
making records and touring
and playing shows together.

01:35:11.962 --> 01:35:15.883
It's not so much that we grew up.
It's more like we wised up.

01:35:17.050 --> 01:35:19.553
Now we can say that our reflection
on the mistakes we made

01:35:19.803 --> 01:35:23.098
came from Yauch
and the ideas that he brought back to us.

01:35:23.182 --> 01:35:24.433
But that's partly true.

01:35:24.516 --> 01:35:26.143
I mean, we were ready for change.

01:35:26.476 --> 01:35:29.605
We encouraged each other to do
and say what we wanted to do.

01:35:29.938 --> 01:35:32.524
If Yauch wanted to make a song called
"Bodhisattva Vow,"

01:35:32.608 --> 01:35:36.069
about a Buddhist vow to make
the world a better place, of course.

01:35:36.153 --> 01:35:37.362
That's fucking awesome.

01:35:39.615 --> 01:35:41.950
We have the maturity to realize

01:35:42.034 --> 01:35:44.578
that what we make and have made matters

01:35:44.661 --> 01:35:47.581
and affects people in good and bad ways.

01:35:47.664 --> 01:35:50.834
We're grateful that we've been around
long enough to comment on it.

01:35:50.918 --> 01:35:54.588
And we're lucky enough
to be able to do something about it now.

01:35:54.671 --> 01:35:59.176
There's a song on Hello Nasty called
"Song for the Man" that Adam wrote...

01:35:59.259 --> 01:36:01.762
Where are you? Adam wrote this one.

01:36:01.845 --> 01:36:06.141
...about the ways that so many men act
when a woman walks by.

01:36:06.225 --> 01:36:08.769
An interviewer called him out
as a hypocrite

01:36:08.852 --> 01:36:10.479
and challenged him about the song

01:36:10.562 --> 01:36:12.898
coming from
the "Fight for Your Right (To Party)" guy.

01:36:12.981 --> 01:36:15.108
And when I heard his answer,

01:36:15.192 --> 01:36:16.693
I was proud to be his friend.

01:36:17.528 --> 01:36:19.905
He said something like,

01:36:19.988 --> 01:36:23.242
"I'd rather be a hypocrite
than the same person forever."

01:36:29.373 --> 01:36:30.874
All right.

01:36:30.958 --> 01:36:32.876
I'm gonna tell you a story about--

01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:36.338
Well, I'm gonna tell you a story
from our book, Beastie Boys Book.

01:36:38.131 --> 01:36:39.049
All right.

01:36:40.008 --> 01:36:41.468
It's called, "The Last Gig."

01:36:47.975 --> 01:36:50.602
We didn't know it was gonna be
the last gig we'd ever play.

01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:54.314
Everything that happened that day
was totally normal.

01:36:54.398 --> 01:36:58.026
The gig was headlining a huge festival
in Tennessee called Bonnaroo.

01:36:58.110 --> 01:37:00.028
And it was 2009.

01:37:00.112 --> 01:37:02.865
Thousands and thousands of people
were gonna be there,

01:37:02.948 --> 01:37:04.533
and we were the headliner.

01:37:04.616 --> 01:37:06.785
We went down to Tennessee early,
'cause we were gonna shoot a video

01:37:06.869 --> 01:37:08.704
for a new song that hadn't come out yet.

01:37:08.787 --> 01:37:13.083
It was us, the rapper Nas,
and Roman Coppola was gonna direct it.

01:37:13.166 --> 01:37:16.378
It was oddly normal for us
to play these huge concerts

01:37:16.461 --> 01:37:19.173
and have someone like Roman
with a Bolex camera filming us

01:37:19.256 --> 01:37:21.675
running around supermarkets in Tennessee.

01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:26.388
The weirder,
the more normal for us by then.

01:37:30.142 --> 01:37:32.644
Things in life never come full circle.

01:37:33.478 --> 01:37:35.397
Maybe once or twice they're hexagonal,

01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:38.442
but to me they're almost always misshapen,

01:37:38.525 --> 01:37:41.570
as if drawn by a toddler in crayon.

01:37:42.529 --> 01:37:44.823
There's common threads, sure.

01:37:44.907 --> 01:37:47.034
Yauch and me and Mike are still together.

01:37:47.117 --> 01:37:49.036
Still laughing. Still family.

01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:53.248
Al Green was finishing his set
on one of the many stages at the festival,

01:37:53.332 --> 01:37:56.168
and so hearing his voice in the distance
was comforting.

01:37:56.251 --> 01:37:58.462
Just like how it was
when I was in high school,

01:37:58.545 --> 01:38:00.631
in my bedroom,
waiting for them to come over.

01:38:04.343 --> 01:38:07.012
But now was such a great distance
from that.

01:38:14.269 --> 01:38:17.689
The rearview
was nearly impossible to reposition.

01:38:18.982 --> 01:38:21.443
Kate Schellenbach wasn't there
with us in Tennessee.

01:38:21.527 --> 01:38:23.070
John Berry wasn't there.

01:38:23.153 --> 01:38:25.447
Dave Scilken, Bosco, the Captain,

01:38:25.948 --> 01:38:27.574
Dave Parsons, Mike's dad--

01:38:35.874 --> 01:38:37.876
Mike's dad, my mom, not there.

01:38:38.669 --> 01:38:39.711
So many more.

01:38:40.337 --> 01:38:43.298
Now me and Adam and Mike
were older, and we knew it.

01:38:43.382 --> 01:38:44.925
We were about to put out a new record,

01:38:45.008 --> 01:38:47.302
and we were still very much
in the game though.

01:38:47.386 --> 01:38:49.555
We were getting ready
to start all over again.

01:38:51.348 --> 01:38:56.562
Headlining a huge festival is very
different from a nice turnout at CBGBs.

01:38:57.813 --> 01:39:00.983
But shit, man. We didn't know it was
gonna be the last show we'd ever play.

01:39:06.655 --> 01:39:08.490
A major loss in the music business.

01:39:08.574 --> 01:39:12.953
Adam Yauch of the Beastie Boys
has died after a long fight with cancer.

01:39:13.036 --> 01:39:15.664
He was known as MCA,
and the three musicians together

01:39:15.747 --> 01:39:19.001
were among the few
at the vanguard of a movement.

01:39:19.084 --> 01:39:23.005
Yauch was a self-taught musician
and later a filmmaker.

01:39:23.088 --> 01:39:27.050
Adam Yauch, MCA, was 47 years old.

01:39:37.519 --> 01:39:39.897
I mean, we all have
different types of friends.

01:39:41.106 --> 01:39:43.400
There's the one
that's kind of an asshole...

01:39:44.484 --> 01:39:46.653
but fun to be around once in a while.

01:39:46.737 --> 01:39:48.655
Fun to get drunk and talk shit with,

01:39:48.739 --> 01:39:52.409
but you'd never actually call on them
for physical or emotional help

01:39:52.492 --> 01:39:54.328
'cause they're just unreliable.

01:39:54.411 --> 01:39:58.540
Or there's a friend you see
once in a while, and it's a nice hangout,

01:39:58.624 --> 01:39:59.791
and you're always like,

01:39:59.875 --> 01:40:01.960
"I should spend more time
with that person,"

01:40:02.044 --> 01:40:04.087
but for some reason, you just don't.

01:40:04.922 --> 01:40:06.256
Then there's that true friend,

01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:08.342
the one you'd
be on the phone with forever.

01:40:09.134 --> 01:40:12.095
The one that helps you move
or meets you at the hospital

01:40:12.179 --> 01:40:14.348
or has a permanent spot
on their couch for you

01:40:14.431 --> 01:40:16.391
just in case you'd ever need it.

01:40:17.309 --> 01:40:20.604
Now those types of friends are rare.
We all know.

01:40:20.687 --> 01:40:23.440
But there's an even rarer type of friend:

01:40:23.524 --> 01:40:25.442
The one that gets you motivated.

01:40:25.526 --> 01:40:27.361
The one that not only
gets themselves going

01:40:27.444 --> 01:40:29.196
and doing great things,

01:40:29.279 --> 01:40:32.407
but says, "We should all
get together and do this."

01:40:32.491 --> 01:40:34.535
And then does it.

01:40:34.618 --> 01:40:36.578
Adam Yauch was that type of friend.

01:40:45.045 --> 01:40:47.339
A once-in-a-lifetime type of friend.

01:40:47.965 --> 01:40:50.217
The friend that makes it happen.

01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:52.678
The friend that inspires you to go big.

01:40:54.012 --> 01:40:56.723
Can we turn this up? This is a song
that Yauch wrote for Hello Nasty.

01:41:01.103 --> 01:41:06.483
Now around 1990, Yauch went to India,
Nepal and met Tibetans in exile.

01:41:06.567 --> 01:41:09.528
And he wanted to understand
their vow of nonviolence.

01:41:10.445 --> 01:41:13.323
Why did they choose not to fight back
against the government

01:41:13.407 --> 01:41:16.827
that would beat and imprison a person
just for waving a Tibetan flag?

01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:18.370
He wanted to know more.

01:41:18.453 --> 01:41:20.163
He wanted to help.

01:41:20.247 --> 01:41:21.707
But in typical Yauch fashion,

01:41:21.790 --> 01:41:23.959
instead of just writing a check
to some organization,

01:41:24.042 --> 01:41:25.127
he started his own.

01:41:25.210 --> 01:41:26.753
The Milarepa Fund.

01:41:29.631 --> 01:41:32.384
And he organized the first
Tibetan Freedom Concert.

01:41:32.467 --> 01:41:34.261
A massive two-day benefit concert

01:41:34.344 --> 01:41:38.724
in Golden Gate Park
in San Francisco in 1996.

01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:43.270
It was the biggest charity concert
since Live Aid.

01:41:43.353 --> 01:41:45.022
What he did was historic.

01:41:45.105 --> 01:41:48.483
Hundreds of thousands of people
had "Free Tibet" on their tongues

01:41:48.567 --> 01:41:50.485
and on their bumper stickers.

01:41:50.569 --> 01:41:52.863
They heard the call for nonviolence

01:41:52.946 --> 01:41:55.782
all because of that guy in Beastie Boys.

01:41:55.866 --> 01:41:57.576
I mean, who does that?

01:42:03.665 --> 01:42:06.418
Yauch, Mike and I
have spent more time with each other

01:42:06.502 --> 01:42:07.836
than with our own families.

01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:09.004
Really.

01:42:09.087 --> 01:42:11.131
So when it comes to my friend
the rapper Mike D,

01:42:11.215 --> 01:42:14.843
AKA Sweet Lou, AKA Michael Louis Diamond,

01:42:14.927 --> 01:42:16.553
I know him, right?

01:42:16.637 --> 01:42:17.679
Like, everything.

01:42:17.763 --> 01:42:19.348
And he knows me just the same.

01:42:19.431 --> 01:42:22.184
But Adam Yauch, a puzzle.

01:42:22.267 --> 01:42:23.435
A conundrum.

01:42:24.645 --> 01:42:26.480
Finish up. I can't.

01:42:26.563 --> 01:42:29.233
A labyrinth of ideas and emotions.

01:42:29.316 --> 01:42:31.652
An enigma, a wild card.

01:42:31.735 --> 01:42:34.530
And after 35 years of friendship,

01:42:34.613 --> 01:42:38.492
I never knew
what he was gonna do or say next.

01:42:38.575 --> 01:42:41.453
He was a living contradiction
of people's ideas

01:42:41.537 --> 01:42:45.791
of how or what
you're supposed to be or do.

01:42:46.625 --> 01:42:48.710
I mean,
he's the Buddhist guy who's telling me

01:42:48.794 --> 01:42:53.173
how last night he was at this
after-after party for some fashion show.

01:42:53.924 --> 01:42:56.802
And he's the
"Fight for Your Right (To Party)" dude

01:42:56.885 --> 01:43:00.138
who went trekking through Nepal
on some kind of discovery quest.

01:43:00.222 --> 01:43:03.016
And then he met with politicians
in Washington, DC,

01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:06.478
letting them know what he'd seen
and what he learned.

01:43:13.819 --> 01:43:17.573
He once told me that the main draw
to him about the Dalai Lama

01:43:17.656 --> 01:43:19.491
was that he was a funny dude.

01:43:21.076 --> 01:43:23.453
Now obviously
there were so many other reasons

01:43:23.537 --> 01:43:26.540
he was drawn to spirituality,
faith and Buddhism, right?

01:43:26.623 --> 01:43:29.918
But "the funny dude" made perfect sense
to me, coming from Yauch.

01:43:30.002 --> 01:43:33.005
'Cause funny is very important.

01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:45.434
Who gets to show up to work every day
only to work with their two best friends?

01:43:46.226 --> 01:43:47.769
I did.

01:43:47.853 --> 01:43:49.771
I guess that makes me one lucky duck.

01:43:49.855 --> 01:43:54.985
I mean, it's not like all of it was easy
or highlight-filled every moment.

01:43:55.068 --> 01:43:58.906
I mean, there'd be times when two of us
wanted to do something so badly,

01:43:58.989 --> 01:44:03.243
when every cell in your body
is like, "Yes. We're doing this,"

01:44:03.327 --> 01:44:05.287
only to have one of us say,

01:44:05.370 --> 01:44:11.376
"That might be cool for you guys,
but I'm just not so into it."

01:44:12.461 --> 01:44:16.298
And then I'd go home
and I'd complain to whoever would listen.

01:44:16.381 --> 01:44:20.677
And I'd be like, "Oh, my God.
You won't believe what Horovitz did today.

01:44:20.761 --> 01:44:24.097
I mean, he fucking--
He's driving me fucking crazy."

01:44:24.181 --> 01:44:30.229
But as attached as any of us might
have been to any song or lyric or idea,

01:44:30.312 --> 01:44:34.233
we still loved each other
and being together even more.

01:44:43.283 --> 01:44:46.453
Well, just plug me in
Just like I was Eddie Harris

01:44:46.537 --> 01:44:49.122
You're eating crazy cheese
Like you would think I'm from Paris

01:44:49.206 --> 01:44:51.834
You know I get fly
You think I get high

01:44:51.917 --> 01:44:54.586
You know that I'm gone
And I'mma tell you all why

01:44:54.670 --> 01:44:58.340
So tell me who are you dissing
Maybe I'm missing

01:44:58.423 --> 01:45:01.301
The reason that you're smiling
Or wilding, so listen

01:45:01.385 --> 01:45:03.262
In my head
I just want to take 'em down

01:45:03.345 --> 01:45:06.557
Imagination set loose
And I'm gonna shake 'em down

01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:08.475
Let it flow like a mudslide

01:45:08.559 --> 01:45:11.186
When I get on
I like to ride and glide

01:45:11.270 --> 01:45:14.022
I've got depth of perception
In my text, y'all

01:45:14.106 --> 01:45:17.234
I get props at my mention
'Cause I vex, y'all

01:45:17.317 --> 01:45:19.403
So what'cha, what'cha
What'cha want?

01:45:19.486 --> 01:45:22.698
I get so funny with my money
That you flaunt

01:45:22.781 --> 01:45:25.784
I said, "Where'd you get
Your information from, huh?"

01:45:25.868 --> 01:45:28.662
You think that you can front
When revelation comes?

01:45:28.745 --> 01:45:32.374
Yeah, you can't front on that

01:45:39.798 --> 01:45:42.301
-So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
-What'cha want?

01:45:42.384 --> 01:45:44.887
-So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
-What'cha want?

01:45:44.970 --> 01:45:46.972
Said, what'cha, what'cha
What'cha want?

01:45:47.055 --> 01:45:48.056
What'cha want?

01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:50.017
Said, what'cha, what'cha
What'cha want?

01:45:50.100 --> 01:45:51.351
So what'cha want?

01:45:51.435 --> 01:45:53.645
If I can, I just wanna cut in here
and say that I love these guys,

01:45:53.729 --> 01:45:56.106
and I've grown up with 'em, and I think
they're great, and I just love 'em.

01:46:13.999 --> 01:46:15.918
Mike D, Mike D.

01:46:19.171 --> 01:46:22.591
Well, now, don't you tell me to smile

01:46:22.674 --> 01:46:24.510
You stick around
I'll make it worth your while

01:46:24.593 --> 01:46:27.095
My number's beyond what you can dial

01:46:27.179 --> 01:46:29.389
Maybe it's because I'm so versatile

01:46:29.473 --> 01:46:31.433
Style, profile, I said

01:46:31.517 --> 01:46:33.977
It always brings me back when I hear
"Ooh, child!"

01:46:34.061 --> 01:46:36.188
From the Hudson River out to the Nile

01:46:36.271 --> 01:46:38.607
I run the marathon
To the very last mile

01:46:38.690 --> 01:46:40.651
Well, if you battle me
I will revile

01:46:40.734 --> 01:46:42.611
People always sayin' my style is wild

01:46:42.694 --> 01:46:45.155
You've got gall, you've got guile

01:46:45.239 --> 01:46:47.115
Step to me
I'm a rap-o-phile

01:46:47.199 --> 01:46:49.785
If you want to battle you're in denial

01:46:49.868 --> 01:46:52.037
Comin' from Uranus to check my style

01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:54.331
Go ahead, put my rhymes on trial

01:46:54.414 --> 01:46:56.625
Cast you off into exile

01:46:56.708 --> 01:47:01.129
Intergalactic, planetary
Planetary, intergalactic

01:47:01.213 --> 01:47:05.717
Intergalactic, planetary
Planetary, intergalactic

01:47:05.801 --> 01:47:07.928
Jazz and AWOL, that's our team

01:47:08.011 --> 01:47:10.222
Step inside the party
Disrupt the whole scene

01:47:10.305 --> 01:47:12.140
When it comes to beats
Well, I'm a fiend

01:47:12.224 --> 01:47:14.268
I like my sugar with coffee and cream

01:47:14.351 --> 01:47:16.436
Well, I gotta keep it going
Keep it going full steam

01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:19.189
Too sweet to be sour
Too nice to be mean

01:47:19.273 --> 01:47:21.108
Well, on the tough-guy style
I'm not too keen

01:47:21.191 --> 01:47:23.777
Trying to change the world
I'mma plot and scheme

01:47:23.861 --> 01:47:26.113
Mario C. likes to keep it clean

01:47:26.196 --> 01:47:28.574
Gonna shine like a sunbeam

01:47:28.657 --> 01:47:30.409
Keep on rappin'
'Cause that's my dream

01:47:30.492 --> 01:47:32.911
Got an A from Moe Dee
For "sticking to themes"

01:47:32.995 --> 01:47:35.163
Now when it comes to envy
Y'all is green

01:47:35.247 --> 01:47:37.332
Jealous of the rhyme
And the rhyme routine

01:47:37.416 --> 01:47:41.962
Another dimension, new galaxy
Intergalactic, planetary

01:47:42.045 --> 01:47:46.508
Intergalactic, planetary
Planetary, intergalactic

01:47:46.592 --> 01:47:50.637
Intergalactic, planetary
Planetary, intergalactic

01:47:50.721 --> 01:47:55.601
Intergalactic, planetary
Planetary, intergalactic

01:47:55.684 --> 01:48:00.105
Intergalactic, planetary
Planetary, intergalactic

01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:04.568
We're from the family tree
Of old-school hip-hop

01:48:04.651 --> 01:48:06.904
Kick off your shoes
And relax your socks

01:48:06.987 --> 01:48:08.989
The rhymes will spread just like a pox

01:48:09.072 --> 01:48:11.450
'Cause the music is live
Like an electric shock

01:48:11.533 --> 01:48:15.996
I am known to do the wop
Also known for the Flintstone Flop

01:48:16.079 --> 01:48:18.207
Tammy D getting biz on the crop

01:48:18.290 --> 01:48:20.083
Beastie Boys known to let the beat

01:48:21.418 --> 01:48:22.461
Drop

01:48:22.544 --> 01:48:24.963
Now when I wrote graffiti
My name was Slop

01:48:25.047 --> 01:48:27.216
If my rap's soup, my beats is stock

01:48:27.299 --> 01:48:29.468
Step from the table
When I start to chop

01:48:29.551 --> 01:48:31.845
I'm the lumberjack
DJ Ad-Rock

01:48:31.929 --> 01:48:34.056
If you try to knock me
You'll get mocked

01:48:34.139 --> 01:48:36.308
I'll stir-fry you in my wok

01:48:36.391 --> 01:48:38.352
Your knees'll start shakin'
And your fingers pop

01:48:38.435 --> 01:48:40.938
Like a pinch on the neck
Of Mr. Spock

01:48:41.021 --> 01:48:45.484
Intergalactic, planetary
Planetary, intergalactic

01:48:45.567 --> 01:48:49.988
Intergalactic, planetary
Planetary, intergalactic

01:48:50.072 --> 01:48:54.493
Intergalactic, planetary
Planetary, intergalactic

01:48:54.576 --> 01:48:59.373
Intergalactic, planetary
Planetary, intergalactic

01:48:59.456 --> 01:49:01.500
Another dimension
Another dimension

01:49:01.583 --> 01:49:03.836
Another dimension
Another dimension

01:49:17.182 --> 01:49:18.225
Do it

01:49:58.348 --> 01:50:00.934
Listen, everybody
Listen, one and all

01:50:01.018 --> 01:50:03.437
We're down in Daytona
And we're havin' a ball

01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:06.398
Said one week spring break
It ain't funny

01:50:06.481 --> 01:50:09.151
Said two days passed
And I'm runnin' outta money

01:50:09.234 --> 01:50:11.904
Said sleepin' in the car
'Cause the hotel's booked

01:50:11.987 --> 01:50:14.489
I met a frat girl cutie
And I got hooked

01:50:14.573 --> 01:50:16.241
I said, "What's your major?"

01:50:16.325 --> 01:50:17.659
Said she majors in psych

01:50:17.743 --> 01:50:20.120
Said I'm down with MTV
And I rock the mic

01:50:20.204 --> 01:50:22.915
She said she wants to meet Alan
And Martha Quinn

01:50:22.998 --> 01:50:24.458
I said my name's MCA

01:50:24.541 --> 01:50:27.669
And I can let you in
I said I'm down in Daytona

01:50:27.753 --> 01:50:30.047
-To get my kicks
-We're the Beastie Boys

01:50:30.130 --> 01:50:31.840
-MTV
-Spring Break

01:50:31.924 --> 01:50:33.509
'86

01:50:33.592 --> 01:50:34.468
What's up with that?

01:50:35.594 --> 01:50:38.555
Last week I was in Chanhassen, Minnesota
with the Beastie Boys.

01:50:39.389 --> 01:50:41.099
They're rehearsing for their tour,
and they said,

01:50:41.183 --> 01:50:43.018
"We want a piece of
Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch."

01:50:43.852 --> 01:50:46.522
-I would love to dunk on them.
-I might have to set that up.

01:50:46.605 --> 01:50:47.481
What's up with that?

01:50:47.564 --> 01:50:51.818
"You motherfuckers ain't shit
compared to us here" kinda vibe.

01:50:52.277 --> 01:50:55.489
-And so by the time--
-Let that sit. Let that sit, Mike.

01:50:55.572 --> 01:50:56.740
That was a good British accent.

01:50:59.201 --> 01:51:00.285
Yo, Mike.

01:51:01.578 --> 01:51:03.956
-Let's go, man.
-Come on, man. We got work to do.

01:51:04.039 --> 01:51:05.916
-Word up, man. It's time to get ill.
-Let's go.

01:51:08.252 --> 01:51:11.129
"Another plane, another train,
another bottle in the brain,"

01:51:11.213 --> 01:51:14.091
the Beastie Boys rapped
in "No Sleep Till" here.

01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:16.760
-Eric.
-What is Brooklyn?

01:51:16.844 --> 01:51:20.097
-You must be talking about grunge.
-Grunge.

01:51:21.849 --> 01:51:22.975
Grunge.

01:51:24.184 --> 01:51:25.185
Grunge.

01:51:25.269 --> 01:51:27.271
Did anyone notice
at Cozy Soup 'n' Burger,

01:51:27.354 --> 01:51:30.148
when you get the burger,
they'd have an ice cream scooper,

01:51:30.232 --> 01:51:32.985
and they have, like,
a drawer with the meat,

01:51:33.068 --> 01:51:34.653
and they just, like, put it in there,

01:51:34.736 --> 01:51:37.030
and they put the scoop of meat
on the grill?

01:51:37.781 --> 01:51:40.826
Fun fact, when we were kids, we'd be like,
"Yo, one day when we're grown-ups,

01:51:40.909 --> 01:51:42.953
we're gonna get a fucking meat drawer
at our house."

01:51:43.036 --> 01:51:45.247
-For real. For real.
-It's true.

01:51:45.330 --> 01:51:46.748
-Right?
-Definitely.

01:51:46.832 --> 01:51:49.710
What is it like touring with
the Foo Fighters and Sonic Youth?

01:51:49.793 --> 01:51:52.713
I mean, the Foo Fighters, I grew up
with these guys, since like I was--

01:51:52.796 --> 01:51:54.673
When I was 4 years old, I used to--

01:51:54.756 --> 01:51:56.717
-Yo, let me tell you--
-These kids is nuts.

01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:59.052
These kids is, like,
off the hook, these kids.

01:51:59.136 --> 01:52:02.014
Let me tell you, me and Sonic Youth
go back like babies and pacifiers.

01:52:02.097 --> 01:52:03.015
-That's right.
-For real.

01:52:03.098 --> 01:52:06.310
-These kids is, like, gone.
-Yo, I used to wash dogs with Thurston.

01:52:06.393 --> 01:52:08.604
Man, we already washed that dog already.

01:52:08.687 --> 01:52:11.064
-You don't have to get mad at me.
-We washed it!

01:52:11.148 --> 01:52:13.901
What's up, man? Y'all can't wash dogs
for the rest of your life, man.

01:52:13.984 --> 01:52:17.070
Let's go on tour, man.
You know, let's go do some shows.

01:52:17.154 --> 01:52:20.282
So we are psyched, and we are surprised.

01:52:20.365 --> 01:52:22.117
But we are also--

01:52:23.410 --> 01:52:25.746
We are also surprised that Rick--

01:52:30.209 --> 01:52:35.130
"And we were also surprised--
Rick was Russian?"

01:52:36.507 --> 01:52:39.510
That's why we, like, click. All these,
you know, groups just, like, click.

01:52:39.593 --> 01:52:41.970
We're running like one big clique.
You know what I'm saying?

01:52:42.054 --> 01:52:43.347
What was your favorite part of the show?

01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:46.683
I think when we came out was a good part.

01:52:46.767 --> 01:52:48.810
-What do you say?
-I think when these dudes were on,

01:52:48.894 --> 01:52:50.562
when they were playing "King of Rock"
and we were on,

01:52:50.646 --> 01:52:52.356
that was probably the best part.

01:52:52.439 --> 01:52:55.526
-Yeah, the little flash pot, yeah.
-I think that's the greatest--

01:52:55.609 --> 01:52:57.694
-It's just our clique.
-Yeah, it's a united clique.

01:52:59.238 --> 01:53:00.531
'Cause you know--

01:53:00.614 --> 01:53:02.950
-Mike's lost his fucking mind.
-Shit.

01:53:03.033 --> 01:53:05.369
What the fuck is wrong with Mike?

01:53:06.370 --> 01:53:08.205
You need shoes to go with those,
my brother.

01:53:08.288 --> 01:53:09.623
Where are the shoes at?

01:53:09.706 --> 01:53:11.750
I can't find the shoes or the suede pants.

01:53:11.834 --> 01:53:14.253
When MTV comes across a video
that is visually striking

01:53:14.336 --> 01:53:17.798
and pushes the boundaries of video making,
we crown it a breakthrough video.

01:53:17.881 --> 01:53:19.591
"Shadrach" is interesting for two reasons.

01:53:19.675 --> 01:53:21.552
First because the animation
is so well-done,

01:53:21.635 --> 01:53:24.888
and second because it was directed
and animated by a member of the band.

01:53:24.972 --> 01:53:27.599
Directors Jonathan Dayton
and Valerie Faris shot some footage

01:53:27.683 --> 01:53:29.184
of the Beastie Boys in concert.

01:53:29.268 --> 01:53:32.855
And then band member MCA took the footage
and painted over it frame by frame

01:53:32.938 --> 01:53:34.648
to create some terrific animation.

01:53:34.731 --> 01:53:35.816
Check out his handiwork.

01:53:35.899 --> 01:53:38.694
This is the brand new one
from the Beastie Boys. It's "Shadrach."

01:53:41.154 --> 01:53:42.656
Wait a second, Adam.

01:53:42.739 --> 01:53:45.158
Wait one second. I'm sorry, Adam.

01:53:45.242 --> 01:53:47.286
-Adam--
-What? What is it, David Cross?

01:53:47.369 --> 01:53:49.746
What is--
I'm sorry, I'm just-- What is that?

01:53:49.830 --> 01:53:51.331
What is it, Ben Stiller?

01:53:51.415 --> 01:53:53.917
-Hey, guys.
-What? Who's--

01:53:54.001 --> 01:53:55.752
-How you doing?
-Hey, Steve Buscemi.

01:53:55.836 --> 01:53:57.212
Hey, how are you?

01:53:57.296 --> 01:54:00.966
I'm sorry. I was walking down the street
to get my scratch-off tickets

01:54:01.049 --> 01:54:02.426
and I couldn't help but overhear--

01:54:02.509 --> 01:54:05.053
I just woke up.
But I thought I heard you--

01:54:06.889 --> 01:54:09.391
I thought
I heard you mention Paul's Boutique.

01:54:09.474 --> 01:54:12.186
Their newest album is called
Licensed to Kill,

01:54:12.269 --> 01:54:14.438
and it went platinum
after only eight weeks.

01:54:14.521 --> 01:54:15.564
Licensed to Kill, right?

01:54:15.647 --> 01:54:17.191
-Ill.
-Ill!

01:54:18.317 --> 01:54:19.401
That's "ill," Joan.

01:54:19.484 --> 01:54:22.779
Well, I'm telling you.
I've got my stupid contacts in. Hold on.

01:54:22.863 --> 01:54:25.616
Their album is called Licensed to Ill.

01:54:26.116 --> 01:54:28.202
That's a stupid name for an album.

01:54:29.036 --> 01:54:32.831
Everybody knows Paul's Boutique
was a huge commercial failure.

01:54:32.915 --> 01:54:34.958
-An abject failure.
-It was a flop.

01:54:35.042 --> 01:54:36.710
-Couldn't get any worse.
-Nobody bought it.

01:54:36.793 --> 01:54:39.004
That must've been, like, so humiliating.

01:54:39.087 --> 01:54:42.674
A huge massive failure.

01:54:42.758 --> 01:54:45.344
-Thank you very much for reminding us.
-We all know that.

01:54:45.427 --> 01:54:48.514
When that tree fell in the forest,
nobody heard that shit.

01:54:49.723 --> 01:54:54.311
And so my question to you is,
like, how did you go on--

01:54:54.394 --> 01:54:59.316
I mean, not even "how."
Why did you continue to go on as a band?

01:54:59.399 --> 01:55:02.152
-But...
-Retroactively, as we all know,

01:55:02.236 --> 01:55:06.949
it's now hailed as one of, like, the most
influential rap albums ever, right?

01:55:07.699 --> 01:55:13.872
I'm just saying, Adam, that to me
it's kind of like a rap Pet Sounds...

01:55:13.956 --> 01:55:17.835
...due to its dense use
of samples, layers--

01:55:19.419 --> 01:55:21.630
Samples, layers.

01:55:21.713 --> 01:55:22.923
Hip.

01:55:23.006 --> 01:55:24.007
Hop.

01:55:24.758 --> 01:55:29.221
And here you're talking about it like,
"Nobody liked it."

01:55:29.304 --> 01:55:31.557
And I feel like you do this thing
where you're like,

01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:34.351
"It wasn't good,
so I'm gonna say it wasn't good.

01:55:34.434 --> 01:55:36.979
But I really I want you
to feel that it's good."

01:55:37.062 --> 01:55:39.314
It's like a thing in your head
where you want us to feel bad,

01:55:39.398 --> 01:55:40.774
but it's really
'cause you feel bad for yourself.

01:55:40.858 --> 01:55:42.109
I don't wanna get into what it's about.

01:55:42.192 --> 01:55:43.610
And this is not a big thing.

01:55:43.694 --> 01:55:45.779
-Hey, Mike. How's it going, man?
-What's up?

01:55:45.863 --> 01:55:47.364
-And tonight...
-Yo, what's up?

01:55:47.447 --> 01:55:50.492
We're gonna world premiere "Jimmy James."

01:55:50.576 --> 01:55:51.410
All right.

01:55:51.493 --> 01:55:52.911
Is that from The Little Rascals,
where they go,

01:55:52.995 --> 01:55:56.206
"What's your name?" "Jimmy James.
Ask me again, I'll tell you the same"?

01:55:56.290 --> 01:55:57.875
No, actually it's from My Three Sons.

01:55:57.958 --> 01:56:02.129
The episode where Uncle Charlie freaks out
with the cleaver on all the kids.

01:56:02.713 --> 01:56:05.716
Okay, I think, when it comes to touring,
out of all of the tours we did,

01:56:05.799 --> 01:56:08.760
I think, like, the weirdest person
we toured with is Mike, probably.

01:56:08.844 --> 01:56:11.054
This kid is off the hook, man.

01:56:15.601 --> 01:56:17.144
Hi, I'm Mike.

01:56:17.227 --> 01:56:20.856
-So...
-I'm in a band called Beastie Boys.

01:56:23.108 --> 01:56:24.359
Hello, man.

01:56:25.736 --> 01:56:28.030
"Darkness at the break of noon.

01:56:28.906 --> 01:56:31.658
Shadows over a silvery spoon.

01:56:32.826 --> 01:56:36.538
Handmade blades, child's balloon."

01:56:42.419 --> 01:56:44.880
Hey, don't miss the Beastie Boys,
'cause they're on tour, summer sweat '92.

01:56:44.963 --> 01:56:46.924
-All right!
-What happens after?

01:56:47.007 --> 01:56:50.052
-Hell, yeah!
-Where do you go next?

01:56:52.971 --> 01:56:56.558
Party people, Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys
are on their way to your town right now.

01:56:56.642 --> 01:56:59.353
And we're gonna be cold kickin' it live.
Ain't that right, fellas?

01:57:03.815 --> 01:57:05.526
-Baby!
-What's up with that?

01:57:05.609 --> 01:57:07.402
We already washed that dog already.

01:57:07.486 --> 01:57:08.820
You don't have to get mad at me.
