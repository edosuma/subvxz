-Really?
-Yeah.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.956
Between us,
the Rangers have been looking

04:51.183 --> 04:52.457
at several suspicious fires

04:52.684 --> 04:55.127
over the last year that
we believe might be connected.

-So you think
it could be serial?
-Unofficially.

Well, I'm glad
I'm not the only one.

05:01.376 --> 05:02.801
So, you have any idea
who's behind it?

05:03.028 --> 05:04.452
No. We still don't have
concrete evidence

05:04.471 --> 05:05.679
that they're arson.

05:06.698 --> 05:07.973
I do have a theory, though.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.308
Do you mind sharing it?

05:09.459 --> 05:12.227
I believe he's one of yours.

05:13.463 --> 05:14.796
You think a firefighter
could be behind it?

05:14.815 --> 05:17.390

It would take someone

05:17.484 --> 05:19.225

to do all this

05:19.378 --> 05:22.212
-and still fly under the radar.
-CARLOS: Dad, should I make you

05:22.230 --> 05:25.231
-a tinfoil hat while I'm here?
-Ha-ha. There is precedent.

05:25.326 --> 05:28.493
Most notorious arsonist
in California history

05:28.720 --> 05:30.570
-was a fire captain.
-He's right.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.980
-John Orr.
-Serial arson

05:33.000 --> 05:35.575
is often triggered by some sort
of traumatic life event.

05:35.727 --> 05:39.004
So we're looking at anybody
who's been laid off,

05:39.155 --> 05:43.175
divorced, or had a major illness
around the new year.

05:43.402 --> 05:45.418
Do you have anybody
that fits that profile?

05:45.571 --> 05:48.496
Uh, well, like I said,
it's just a theory.

05:48.590 --> 05:53.000
But if you think of anybody
who does, you let me know.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.245
Yeah.

05:55.263 --> 05:57.522
You'll be my first call.

06:00.586 --> 06:02.268
Thanks for letting me
come over so late.

06:02.363 --> 06:04.270
I hope I'm not
putting you guys out.

06:04.365 --> 06:05.589

06:09.444 --> 06:11.036
What's going on?

06:11.930 --> 06:13.020
I need a drink first.

06:13.115 --> 06:16.124
Oh, boy.
Okay, it's that bad, huh?

06:17.102 --> 06:18.284
It's worse.

06:19.454 --> 06:21.546
Billy was the only one
that I told about the arsons.

06:21.698 --> 06:23.123
And nobody else knew

06:23.217 --> 06:24.532
I was gonna be
at the warehouse tonight.

06:24.626 --> 06:26.443
So what are you,
what are you saying to me?

06:26.536 --> 06:28.111
That he clubbed you
over the head,

06:28.130 --> 06:29.388
just to save your life later?

06:29.615 --> 06:31.556
-Why would he do that?
-To gain my trust.

06:31.708 --> 06:34.559
To make sure that I didn't
go to the police with evidence.

06:34.711 --> 06:38.563
Cap, I really, really hope
that you don't just expect me

06:38.790 --> 06:42.292
to stand here and nod along
while you accuse my friend

06:42.310 --> 06:45.311
of 17 years of being
some sort of a serial arsonist.

06:45.464 --> 06:48.481
I'm not accusing anybody
tonight; I-I came here

06:48.575 --> 06:51.134
for you to convince me
that I'm wrong.

06:51.227 --> 06:53.470
But it all adds up.

06:53.563 --> 06:55.914
He's got the experience,
he's got nothing but time

06:56.065 --> 06:57.398
and freedom on his hands.

06:57.492 --> 06:59.084
Man, don't put
this stuff in my head.

06:59.311 --> 07:02.178
Look, Billy would never.

07:02.180 --> 07:03.647
He's a good man.

07:03.665 --> 07:05.815
He's also capable of
spectacular acts of deception,

07:05.834 --> 07:09.319
or have you forgotten that
he tried to steal my firehouse?

07:09.412 --> 07:11.263
No, of course I haven't.
That's-that's different.

07:11.414 --> 07:13.840
That's-- Look, that was
personal, all right?

07:13.934 --> 07:15.416
This is evil.

07:15.436 --> 07:17.010
Plus the guy can hardly
stand up half the time

07:17.162 --> 07:19.438
with all the treatment
that they've been giving him.

07:19.589 --> 07:20.772
Yeah, well, he carried me
out of that warehouse

07:20.924 --> 07:21.940
just fine tonight.

07:22.167 --> 07:23.925
(quietly):
Oh...

07:23.944 --> 07:27.112
Gabriel and the Texas Rangers
say that the serial arsonist

07:27.339 --> 07:31.432
probably suffered some sort
of traumatic life event

07:31.526 --> 07:34.101
that made them want
to lash out at the world.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.997
Doesn't that sound like Billy?

07:38.200 --> 07:39.975
It also sounds like you.

07:39.977 --> 07:44.354
Look, Billy's cancer came back
five months ago.

07:44.372 --> 07:46.706
I know, it was
right after Christmas.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.116
The fires started
ten days later.

07:49.211 --> 07:51.861
You can't prove anything, okay?

07:51.880 --> 07:53.546
That's circumstantial. You...

07:53.699 --> 07:56.475
-You don't know.
-No, and I don't want to accuse

07:56.626 --> 07:58.868
an innocent man,
particularly a sick one.

07:58.887 --> 08:01.387
-And who just saved your hide.
-Exactly.

08:01.482 --> 08:04.140
GRACE:
I don't think you have a choice.

08:05.393 --> 08:06.818
So-- um, I don't mean
to interrupt, sweetheart,

08:07.045 --> 08:10.137
but, Captain Strand,
you have to report this.

08:10.232 --> 08:11.531
Now, I don't want
to believe it, either,

08:11.641 --> 08:12.824
but if you're wrong,

08:13.051 --> 08:14.976
then the truth will be
on Billy's side.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.811
But if you're right?

08:16.830 --> 08:19.748
Then you got to stop him
before he kills somebody.

08:26.322 --> 08:29.174
Is all this cloak-and-dagger
really necessary?

08:29.401 --> 08:32.569
I'm due to testify
in Pflugerville in 30 minutes.

08:32.662 --> 08:36.573
Well, believe me, this one's
worth going off the beaten path.

08:36.591 --> 08:39.075
Well, you said you had
something big on the phone,

08:39.094 --> 08:40.668
so what is it?

08:40.762 --> 08:44.022
You remember that serial
arsonist Strand told you about?

08:44.173 --> 08:45.248
Ah, this again?

08:45.267 --> 08:47.751
He's real, Investigator.

08:47.769 --> 08:49.194
You hear about
the warehouse fire

08:49.421 --> 08:51.437
-last night in Round Rock?
-Yeah.

08:51.590 --> 08:54.658

09:42.583 --> 09:44.958
(indistinct chatter)

09:47.570 --> 09:49.646
-Where's the photographer?
-MATEO: Yo!

09:49.664 --> 09:51.405
I need a forensic
photographer now.

09:51.425 --> 09:54.075
Will somebody tell me
what this is about?

09:54.094 --> 09:56.152
(siren wailing)

09:56.245 --> 09:57.821
-(tires screeching)
-MAN: Freeze!

09:57.914 --> 09:59.839
-(guns clicking)
-MAN 2: Hands, hands!
-On your knees!

09:59.991 --> 10:02.767
-Get down!
-Get on the ground!

10:02.919 --> 10:04.677
-Get him up.
-(handcuffs clicking)

10:04.771 --> 10:06.587
Owen Strand,
you are under arrest

10:06.607 --> 10:08.181
for criminal trespass, reckless
destruction of property,

10:08.333 --> 10:11.000
aggravated assault and arson.

10:11.094 --> 10:13.636
You got to be kidding me.

10:14.615 --> 10:18.099
Two days ago you didn't believe
there was an arsonist.

10:18.193 --> 10:21.745
Yeah, well, we believe you now.

10:22.864 --> 10:24.514
MATEO:
No, I'm telling you, it was like

10:24.532 --> 10:27.016
a full-on raid, it was like
something out of
<i> Scarface.</i>

10:27.110 --> 10:28.609
They ransacked the place.

10:28.629 --> 10:30.629
-Why the hell
were they even there?
-I don't know.

10:30.856 --> 10:32.038
They wouldn't tell me anything.

10:32.190 --> 10:34.374
They can't do that, can they?

10:34.526 --> 10:36.209
You see what the police
took out of his house?

10:36.361 --> 10:40.213
Not much. Some charred lamps,
extension cords,

10:40.365 --> 10:42.031
some jars with some liquid.

10:42.050 --> 10:44.033
Wait. Jars of liquid?

10:44.127 --> 10:45.702
-What kind of liquid?
-No idea.

10:45.795 --> 10:48.221
Oh, and they took, like,
this big burned woodwork thing

10:48.373 --> 10:50.131
that I guess he was keeping
behind the garage.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.041
How big are we talking?

10:52.135 --> 10:54.969
Uh, it was like yea high,
yea wide.

10:55.063 --> 10:57.230
So maybe he was building a shelf
or something.

10:57.382 --> 10:59.048
It would have been
a pretty crappy shelf.

10:59.067 --> 11:00.659
Maybe that's why he burned it.

11:02.979 --> 11:04.145
I'm gonna try him again.

11:04.998 --> 11:08.482
-And Cap never talked to you
about any of this?
-(whispers): None of it.

11:08.502 --> 11:11.411
-Yeah, but why would he
keep it a secret?
-I have an idea.

11:11.563 --> 11:12.837
TK:
It's going to voice mail again.

11:13.064 --> 11:14.339
Dad, please call us back.

11:14.566 --> 11:16.323
-We're starting to get worried.
-MARJAN: Uh, TK.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.842
Ah, babe, thank God you're here.

11:17.994 --> 11:22.097
Something's going on with my dad
and we don't know where he is.

11:23.425 --> 11:26.142
-(whispers): We should
talk in private.
-Okay.

11:29.764 --> 11:31.398
TK...

11:31.507 --> 11:34.133
your father was taken
into custody this morning.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.753
What do you mean, custody?

11:36.771 --> 11:38.029
It means he's been arrested.

11:38.181 --> 11:40.347
Arrested? For what?

11:40.367 --> 11:42.367
I don't know
all the details, but...

11:42.594 --> 11:44.369
it looks like arson.

11:44.596 --> 11:46.353
Th-That's wrong.
That's-that's...

11:46.373 --> 11:48.373
I mean, it has to be a mistake.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.542
He-he reported an arson
and nobody believed him.

11:50.693 --> 11:52.877
Well, except for your dad.
Carlos, call your dad,

11:53.029 --> 11:55.121
and he'll clear everything up,
right?

11:55.215 --> 11:57.531
TK...
(takes deep breath)

11:57.551 --> 12:01.035
it was the Texas Rangers
that served the warrant.

12:01.871 --> 12:04.205
My dad was
the arresting officer.

12:04.299 --> 12:05.706
What?

12:05.726 --> 12:06.891
I'm sorry.

12:07.043 --> 12:08.209
You're sorry?

12:08.270 --> 12:09.894
He's out of his mind
if he thinks

12:10.046 --> 12:11.120
my dad is an arsonist, Carlos.

12:11.139 --> 12:12.638
TK, we don't have all the facts.

12:12.791 --> 12:14.290
-What is that supposed to mean?
-Just what I said.

12:14.309 --> 12:16.383
We don't know
what's going on here,

12:16.478 --> 12:18.294
but I do know my father, and he
would never make an arrest

12:18.387 --> 12:21.406
-without a good reason.
-And I know mine,
and he's not a criminal.

12:21.557 --> 12:22.966
I didn't say he was.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.726
Yeah, but your dad is, and it
seems like you're defending him.

12:25.820 --> 12:26.911
I mean, come on,
how does he not know

12:27.063 --> 12:28.246
that he's got the wrong man?

12:28.397 --> 12:29.989
He was with him
for three hours last night.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.416
What are we talking about?

12:31.567 --> 12:33.326
More like an hour.

12:33.478 --> 12:36.145
Your dad was two hours late.
Remember?

12:36.164 --> 12:38.256
He was stuck in traffic
getting your stupid limes.

12:38.407 --> 12:40.425
There was no pileup
on MoPac last night.

12:40.576 --> 12:43.319
-I called Dispatch.
-You checked up
on my dad's story?

12:43.412 --> 12:46.413
-Only because it were starting
to
<i> feel</i>
like a story.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.416
So, are you saying it now? Hmm?

12:49.436 --> 12:51.494
You saying my dad's
a criminal, Carlos?

12:51.513 --> 12:53.254
Are you saying
my dad's a criminal?

12:53.315 --> 12:55.607
Whose side are you on?

12:55.758 --> 12:58.501
Answer me, man!
Let go of me!

12:58.520 --> 13:02.781
-(grunting)
-Babe. Listen to me, okay?
Listen to me.

13:02.932 --> 13:05.617
Okay? You need to calm down,
all right?

13:05.768 --> 13:06.859
(TK panting)

13:06.953 --> 13:09.195
-Okay?
-Carlos...

13:09.347 --> 13:11.289
Leave me alone, Carlos.

13:11.440 --> 13:14.050
-Leave me... alone.
-JUDD: Carlos.

13:14.052 --> 13:16.628

I went by that grocery store

I was trying to figure out

14:50.706 --> 14:51.723
how the arsonist did it.

14:51.874 --> 14:53.282
The only person I told
was Billy.

14:53.301 --> 14:54.967
So he's pointing
the finger at me

14:55.061 --> 14:56.543
'cause he knows I'm onto him!

14:56.638 --> 14:58.545

to Investigator Raymond.

15:04.462 --> 15:07.146
Why would I do that

15:07.298 --> 15:08.740
That's a fair question.

15:08.891 --> 15:11.300
<i> GABRIEL:</i>
<i> Because nobody</i>

15:11.394 --> 15:14.061
Arsonists tend to suffer

You all don't like
being ignored.

15:16.157 --> 15:17.916
(chuckles):
What...

15:18.143 --> 15:19.751
grandeur would I be after

15:19.978 --> 15:23.829
by lighting a warehouse on fire
that I'd already torched once?

15:23.924 --> 15:25.406
Why would I do it?

15:25.425 --> 15:27.150
Maybe because you have access

15:27.243 --> 15:29.168
to APD's missing person reports.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.336
What are you talking about?

15:30.488 --> 15:31.930
APD recently
started getting calls

15:32.157 --> 15:36.250
about a migrant who disappeared
named Jorge Cortez

15:36.344 --> 15:37.936
from his family in Honduras.

15:38.163 --> 15:41.940
They claim he was working at
that warehouse under the table.

15:42.167 --> 15:43.833
I think you caught wind of it

15:43.926 --> 15:47.445
and were worried that the body
might still be somewhere inside.

15:47.596 --> 15:51.532
So you went back
to finish the job.

15:52.193 --> 15:54.285
Well, we found it...

15:54.512 --> 15:55.995
in a crawlspace.

15:57.882 --> 15:59.348
He died...

16:32.233 --> 16:33.807
Dude, you scared me.
For a second

16:33.901 --> 16:36.068
I thought more stormtroopers
were coming through that door.

16:36.221 --> 16:38.979
Sorry, dude.
I should have texted you.

16:39.073 --> 16:43.409
I, um, I can't go home
to Carlos's, obviously.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.670

16:45.897 --> 16:48.256

two guest bedrooms.

17:14.108 --> 17:15.925

before Cap came home.

17:16.018 --> 17:18.453
<i> If</i> Cap comes home.

17:19.355 --> 17:21.280

17:21.432 --> 17:24.858
they wouldn't even
let me see him.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.377
Sorry, man.

17:26.604 --> 17:28.271
-That sucks.
-(sighs)

17:28.289 --> 17:32.008
But hey, he's gonna be okay.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.960
What makes you so sure?

17:35.055 --> 17:36.387
'Cause he's Cap.

17:36.539 --> 17:38.705
He's just the latest
in the long line of superheroes

17:38.725 --> 17:40.058
that's been falsely accused.

they end up pulling
one final epic move

17:49.627 --> 17:51.694

17:52.630 --> 17:53.813
Yeah, look...

17:53.965 --> 17:56.074
I'm feeling pretty lost
right now, man.

17:56.225 --> 17:59.302
His moment's coming. You'll see.

17:59.320 --> 18:02.413
-(sighs)
-Can I ask you something?

18:02.640 --> 18:04.082
What is this?

18:04.309 --> 18:06.918
It's a pasta cutter.

18:07.069 --> 18:08.569
Ah...

You don't have
a lot of time here.

Reyes is already planning
his big press conference

this side of John Orr.

18:38.434 --> 18:40.009
(sighs heavily)

18:40.102 --> 18:42.511
I know this looks bad,
but I didn't do it.

18:42.605 --> 18:43.896
It doesn't look bad.

18:44.048 --> 18:45.014
It looks damning.

18:45.107 --> 18:46.457
A little too damning.

18:46.684 --> 18:49.109
Especially for someone
as intelligent as you.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.020
I was framed.

18:51.038 --> 18:54.206
Okay? You should be looking
at Billy Tyson.

18:54.359 --> 18:56.192
He is the one behind this.

18:56.210 --> 18:58.452
He does seem very determined
to make sure you go down.

18:58.471 --> 19:01.213
Practically put a bow
on the top of your head.

19:01.366 --> 19:03.866
Yeah, of course he did.
He fits the profile.

19:03.959 --> 19:05.368
Big ego.

19:05.386 --> 19:07.294
Feels powerless. A loner.

19:07.388 --> 19:09.538
Has the ability to pull it off.
I know he did it.

19:09.632 --> 19:12.333
Doesn't matter if you know it;
it matters if you can prove it.

19:12.335 --> 19:14.635
Listen to me, Owen.
Is there anything

19:14.654 --> 19:17.380
that you didn't tell Reyes
about this arsonist?

19:17.398 --> 19:19.991
Any information
that you withheld--

19:20.142 --> 19:21.734
now's the time.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.662
-Like what?
-Any thread that...

19:24.813 --> 19:26.555
I could follow back to Billy.

19:26.649 --> 19:29.667
Are there any fires
that you believe he set

19:29.894 --> 19:31.985
that so far
have not been revealed.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.396
Maybe.

19:33.489 --> 19:34.413
Tell me,

19:34.507 --> 19:37.324
and maybe I can try
tying him to one.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.735
How do I know
this isn't some sort of play

19:39.754 --> 19:42.405
that you're running with Reyes?

19:42.423 --> 19:46.442
I give you more arsons,
and you add on more charges.

19:46.444 --> 19:49.203
Reyes doesn't run any plays
with anyone

19:49.263 --> 19:51.247
without a Ranger star.

19:51.265 --> 19:54.025
I am your only hope, Owen.

19:58.272 --> 20:01.106
There might have been
some more incidents that I...

20:01.201 --> 20:02.849
wanted to look into.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.927
Where? How many?

20:05.020 --> 20:06.495
(door opens)

20:08.541 --> 20:09.932
Investigator Raymond.

20:09.951 --> 20:11.334
A word, please.

20:15.122 --> 20:16.439
(door closes)

20:16.532 --> 20:18.791
Are you seriously talking
to my witness

20:18.943 --> 20:20.459
without me present?

20:20.611 --> 20:22.778
And the cameras turned off?
What the hell are you thinking?

20:22.871 --> 20:24.555
I'm thinking
that you have tunnel vision.

20:24.707 --> 20:27.132
I don't know if you're locked
onto Strand because you know

20:27.285 --> 20:28.726
it's gonna make headlines, or
because you don't like the fact

20:28.953 --> 20:32.212
that his boy is dating your son,
which you should have disclosed

20:32.232 --> 20:33.731
to me, by the way.

20:33.882 --> 20:36.067
-How is that any
of your business?
-It becomes my business

20:36.218 --> 20:37.551
when I see you ignoring

20:37.645 --> 20:40.387
all other possibilities
of who could have done this.

20:41.148 --> 20:43.407
There are
no other possibilities.

20:43.634 --> 20:45.326
Not anymore.

20:46.228 --> 20:48.137
(door opens, closes)

20:48.230 --> 20:50.665
<i> Trouble in paradise?</i>

20:51.993 --> 20:53.417
(beeps)

20:57.331 --> 20:58.831
-(clicks)
-There's trouble, all right.

20:58.983 --> 21:00.240
It's all coming your way.

21:00.485 --> 21:02.409
Turns out there was a vagrant
living in that warehouse,

21:02.428 --> 21:05.488
not 50 feet from the point
of origin of the fire.

21:05.506 --> 21:08.157
He had a perfect vantage
to see you start it.

21:08.175 --> 21:10.434
(laughs)
Come on, man.

21:10.661 --> 21:13.345
I've seen better bluffs
at charity poker night.

21:13.498 --> 21:14.772
No, I never bluff.
Don't need to.

21:14.999 --> 21:17.441
Then why are you just now
telling me about this witness?

21:17.593 --> 21:18.925
'Cause he was so injured
in the fire,

21:18.945 --> 21:20.260
I didn't think
he was gonna make it.

21:20.354 --> 21:21.612
He's been in surgery all night,

21:21.764 --> 21:23.022
but his doctors are optimistic

21:23.174 --> 21:24.189
<i> he's gonna pull through now.</i>

21:24.342 --> 21:25.449
<i> And when he wakes,</i>

21:25.601 --> 21:27.192
he's gonna identify you
as the arsonist,

21:27.345 --> 21:28.677
and you'll have
no more cards left to play.

21:28.771 --> 21:31.847
But you confess now,
and we can talk to the judge

21:31.940 --> 21:33.457
about reducing your sentence.

21:33.609 --> 21:35.351
You can pound sand.

21:35.369 --> 21:39.463
'Cause when he wakes up,
he's gonna exonerate me.

21:41.617 --> 21:44.026
Oh, what? Second thoughts?

21:44.045 --> 21:46.119
I know you've been working
very closely

21:46.139 --> 21:48.681
in this investigation
with Billy Tyson.

21:50.626 --> 21:52.384
<i> Just wondering...</i>

21:52.537 --> 21:55.204
Did you share this new good news

21:55.297 --> 21:57.481
about this witness with him?

21:57.633 --> 21:59.734
<i> (knocking)</i>

22:02.547 --> 22:04.471
Hey, Judd, um...

22:04.565 --> 22:06.048
What, you've never heard
of a telephone?

22:06.067 --> 22:08.659
(scoffs) Sorry,
I'm just on my way out.

22:10.071 --> 22:11.746
Or you can come in.

22:13.074 --> 22:16.125
Uh, Billy...

22:17.578 --> 22:19.337
You know I look up to you.

22:19.488 --> 22:22.231
You know, you trained me up
from when I was a probie.

22:22.249 --> 22:24.708
You gave bar none...

22:24.935 --> 22:26.993
the best toast at my wedding.

22:27.088 --> 22:28.346
I appreciate that.

22:28.497 --> 22:30.514
Uh, actually,
I had Harkes help me

22:30.666 --> 22:33.017
punch it up a little bit,
God rest his soul.

22:33.244 --> 22:34.410
Yeah, God rest his soul.

22:34.503 --> 22:36.670
And you and I are
the only two surviving members

22:36.764 --> 22:40.191
of the original 126, after
that terrible night, right?

22:40.342 --> 22:43.009
And I love you. I love you.

22:43.104 --> 22:44.603
Like a brother.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.255
(chuckles):
Well...

22:46.348 --> 22:47.698
Hey, buddy,
I-I feel the same way.

22:47.850 --> 22:49.867
(stammers) I'd love to sit here
and play "remember when,"

22:50.094 --> 22:53.371
-but it's not a good time.
-Yeah, and that's
why I couldn't see it.

22:53.522 --> 22:54.947
At first, right?

22:55.099 --> 22:59.192
I couldn't see it,
and now I can't look away.

22:59.212 --> 23:00.769
Because I know it was you,
Billy.

23:00.863 --> 23:02.529
I know that you
sold out the Cap.

23:02.548 --> 23:04.548
And you did it
for crimes that you done.

23:04.700 --> 23:07.276
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

23:07.369 --> 23:09.202
Don't lie to me, snake.
Don't you lie to me.

23:09.222 --> 23:11.389
You set the fires,

23:11.616 --> 23:13.465
and you broke my heart.

23:13.559 --> 23:15.226
You want to hit me?

23:15.453 --> 23:17.561
Think that will make you
feel better?

23:17.713 --> 23:18.787

really knew you.

Either you were telling
the truth,

26:01.060 --> 26:03.209
and I had to kill the witness,

26:03.229 --> 26:04.544
or you were lying.

26:04.564 --> 26:05.804

in the warehouse,

-I knew better.
-Yeah.

27:57.568 --> 28:00.085
Now it's my turn to ask
for a few things.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.680
When I'm good and ready, Major.

28:02.907 --> 28:06.016
First, I have a question
for Owen.

28:06.168 --> 28:08.352
Sure. What do you want to know?

28:08.503 --> 28:10.503
How did you do it?

28:10.523 --> 28:13.506
How did you figure out
my exact M.O.?

28:13.600 --> 28:17.586
Down to the frayed lamps
and fake circuit breakers?

28:17.604 --> 28:19.087
I just got lucky, I guess.

28:19.106 --> 28:20.197
No. Don't. Don't do that.

28:20.348 --> 28:22.107
Don't condescend to me.

28:22.259 --> 28:24.851
Did-did he tell you to do that
to make me feel smart?

28:24.870 --> 28:28.688
I don't need anyone
to feel smart.

28:28.708 --> 28:30.449
I know that you're clever, Owen.

28:30.601 --> 28:32.668
You don't have to hide it
from me.

28:34.029 --> 28:36.438
Okay.

28:36.457 --> 28:38.457
I figured it out

28:38.551 --> 28:41.593
because it's exactly
the way I would have done it.

28:42.947 --> 28:44.279

28:44.298 --> 28:47.299
I knew you had darkness
in you, too.

28:47.451 --> 28:51.211
Now, I asked you a question,

28:51.230 --> 28:53.021
when you were the one...

28:53.899 --> 28:55.215
...wearing the bracelets.

28:55.234 --> 28:56.382

28:56.402 --> 28:59.052
"How many fires did
the arsonist set?"

28:59.071 --> 29:00.479
That's the one.

29:00.631 --> 29:03.991
Now let's see
how good you really are.

29:07.988 --> 29:10.080
Eleven.

29:10.975 --> 29:12.808
You really are bright,

29:12.826 --> 29:14.918

takes the sting

on this side of the table.

11 is so close.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.985
So close?

29:23.003 --> 29:24.152
So there's more?

29:24.171 --> 29:25.429
There's more.

29:25.656 --> 29:27.080
All right, so...

29:27.099 --> 29:29.541
how many fires did you burn?

29:29.693 --> 29:31.676
How many did I burn? 11.

29:31.829 --> 29:36.181
But the question was:
how many did I set?

29:36.333 --> 29:38.442
Which is a few more.

29:38.593 --> 29:42.613
(laughs) You two think
you're smarter than me?

29:42.764 --> 29:44.523
You're nowhere near my level.

29:44.675 --> 29:47.910
And now everyone is going
to find out.

29:48.770 --> 29:51.371
What are you talking about?

29:53.700 --> 29:57.419
You took the most important
thing in the world from me.

29:59.540 --> 30:04.426
And now I am going to repay
the favor.

30:05.287 --> 30:06.953
(chuckles):
It's funny.

30:06.972 --> 30:09.598
When you're trying to avoid
getting caught...

30:10.643 --> 30:12.959
...your options are so limited.

30:12.978 --> 30:15.128
But when you don't...

30:15.889 --> 30:18.974
...well,
you can really get creative.

30:19.726 --> 30:22.544
Take aluminum iodine powder.

30:22.637 --> 30:27.382
You can grind it to
the consistency of table salt,

30:27.401 --> 30:29.660
sprinkle it almost anywhere.

30:29.887 --> 30:32.663
And you know what happens
when you immerse it in water?

<i> Judd, Judd, listen to me.</i>

31:08.592 --> 31:10.092

31:11.686 --> 31:13.612

at the firehouse?

31:17.209 --> 31:18.783
-How is that possible?
<i> -I don't know.</i>

31:18.936 --> 31:20.210
But he said he was gonna try
to take away

31:20.437 --> 31:21.770
everything that
was important to me.

31:21.863 --> 31:23.380
<i> The 126 is high on that list.</i>

31:23.531 --> 31:24.956
All right, on it, Cap.
I'm-a clear it out.

31:25.109 --> 31:26.608
-Everything okay?
-No.

31:26.627 --> 31:29.202
I need y'all to help me
evacuate this place right away.

31:29.221 --> 31:30.629

-Hey, I need everybody out!

31:30.781 --> 31:32.447
-Everybody get out of here!
-Come one, people, move!

31:32.466 --> 31:33.632
Go across the street.
Evacuate the building right now.

About the other blow-up
at the firehouse...

33:52.439 --> 33:54.773
TK, we agreed.

33:54.925 --> 33:57.092
Nobody has to apologize.

33:57.110 --> 33:59.870
Our dads did
what they had to do.

34:00.021 --> 34:01.521
We were collateral damage.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.431
But seriously,
since when have our dads

34:03.450 --> 34:06.101
-become world-class con artists?
-(scoffs)

34:06.119 --> 34:09.454
My dad's spent 40 years going
after thieves and scammers,

34:09.606 --> 34:12.883
so I guess some of that
rubbed off.

34:13.034 --> 34:15.552
So then, what's my dad's excuse?

if you're truly sorry about
knocking my block off,

34:23.637 --> 34:26.788
maybe you should just give me
naming rights to your firstborn.

34:26.881 --> 34:28.290
-Mm-hmm.
-Uh, what if it's a girl?

34:28.383 --> 34:29.808

-Well, how about we let me
give birth first,

Hey, buddy, if that bourbon's

-(laughter)
-JUDD: Yeah, Cap,

34:58.322 --> 34:59.170
you've been nursing on that

34:59.323 --> 35:00.246
If you don't like it,

35:00.340 --> 35:02.157
it ain't gonna hurt my feelings.

35:02.175 --> 35:05.585
No, I'm just thinking about
the attack on the firehouse.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.163
Yeah, a little property damage.
Get some new windows,

35:08.181 --> 35:10.832

He's right.

35:14.020 --> 35:15.445
We dodged a bullet today.

35:15.597 --> 35:18.173
Or about five IEDs.

35:18.191 --> 35:19.674
Yeah, but here's
what's bugging me.

35:19.767 --> 35:23.102
He said there'd be
a few more fires. That was one.

35:23.163 --> 35:24.863
BILLY:
The guy only had, like, what,

35:24.957 --> 35:27.457
-five hours to set them?
-Yeah, and he was

35:27.609 --> 35:29.367
out of the firehouse
within two hours.

35:29.519 --> 35:30.794
What'd he do
with the other three hours

35:30.945 --> 35:32.712
before he showed up
at the hospital?

35:35.300 --> 35:37.259
Oh, you think he made
another stop?

35:38.470 --> 35:40.453
I just can't help thinking
that the firehouse

35:40.547 --> 35:43.431
was a diversion
from the real thing.

35:44.309 --> 35:46.050
So what's the main event?

35:46.203 --> 35:47.978
I don't know.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.389
But right before
he killed himself,

35:51.483 --> 35:55.318
he said he would take away
what was most important to me.

35:55.470 --> 35:57.320
Oh, you thought
he said that to you?

35:57.472 --> 36:00.657
Where I was sitting, it looked
like he was talking to Reyes.

36:04.388 --> 36:06.571
He was talking to us both.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.239
(beeping)

36:08.333 --> 36:11.001
What's up with this thing?

36:13.005 --> 36:14.562
It's been acting up all day.

36:14.581 --> 36:17.090
I called the company.

-Okay. Okay.

39:18.005 --> 39:19.356
(door crashes)

39:19.583 --> 39:21.507
Hey, guys! Follow me!

39:21.526 --> 39:23.418
-Dad!
-OWEN: Come on!
Come on! Come with me!

39:23.511 --> 39:25.678
BILLY:
Put these over your faces!

39:25.772 --> 39:28.848
-Do not touch the walls
on the way down!
-OWEN: Go, go, go!

39:28.942 --> 39:30.425
Stay close!

39:30.443 --> 39:32.035
JUDD: Hey, hurry up!
Let's go. This whole place

39:32.186 --> 39:35.113
-is about to flash over!
Let's go!
-Come on, move. Stay close.

39:35.207 --> 39:37.690
Go! Come on,
let's go, go, go!

39:38.602 --> 39:40.301
Judd, we got 'em. Come on.
We're all out.

39:40.303 --> 39:42.545
Let's go. Let's go!

39:49.537 --> 39:53.965
-(siren wailing)
-(helicopter whirring)

39:54.059 --> 39:56.434
(indistinct chatter)

40:02.642 --> 40:03.716
CARLOS:
We're fine, Dad.

40:03.735 --> 40:06.403
Yes, sir. I'll see you soon.

40:06.554 --> 40:08.154
Love you, too.

40:11.968 --> 40:13.410
He on his way?

40:14.746 --> 40:18.581
Don't think I've ever heard him
sound so upset before.

40:18.733 --> 40:20.458
Yeah.

40:23.422 --> 40:25.830
Carlos?

40:25.982 --> 40:27.907
How are you doing?

40:28.001 --> 40:29.742
I'm good.

40:29.836 --> 40:32.011
Really, I...

40:45.277 --> 40:49.070
I didn't think we were gonna
make it out.

40:52.099 --> 40:54.842
I should have had
an extinguisher in the bedroom.

40:54.861 --> 40:57.195
I'm... I'm really sorry.
I didn't...

40:57.347 --> 40:59.605
-Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come here.
-I didn't...

40:59.699 --> 41:02.942
It's okay. It's okay.

41:02.961 --> 41:05.044
We're okay.

41:06.706 --> 41:08.631
We're okay.
(kisses)

41:08.783 --> 41:10.300
We're okay.

41:16.549 --> 41:18.290
-Try not to scratch
the blisters.
-Yeah.

41:18.384 --> 41:20.125
-They should fully heal
in a few days.
-Great. Thank you.

41:20.220 --> 41:22.370
-Good to see you again, Holly.
-You too, Captain Vega.

41:22.388 --> 41:24.314
-Thanks.
-BILLY: I swear, New York.

41:24.541 --> 41:25.965
I eat more smoke
hanging out with you

41:25.984 --> 41:28.133
than I ever did
on duty as a fire captain.

41:28.228 --> 41:29.544
It's been a weird week.

41:29.637 --> 41:31.971
Best damn week of my year,
I'll tell you that.

41:31.990 --> 41:34.398
-(laughter)
-TOMMY: Billy, I don't think
I've ever seen anyone

41:34.493 --> 41:36.809
smile so big and have
so many second-degree burns.

41:36.828 --> 41:40.312
Well, these are the least
of my medical concerns, Vega.

41:40.332 --> 41:43.891
If that was my last ride in,
it was a hell of a ride.

41:43.910 --> 41:45.985
OWEN:
Aw, spare me
the maudlin crap, Texas.

41:46.079 --> 41:47.837
You got a lot more rides in you.

41:47.989 --> 41:49.564
JUDD:
Agreed, but to that point,

41:49.657 --> 41:53.417
gentlemen, uh, you know, maybe
you two should go back to golf

41:53.570 --> 41:54.902
or something
a little more low-risk.

41:54.996 --> 41:56.179
The last time
we played golf together,

41:56.406 --> 41:57.905
-he got struck by lightning.
-Damn.

41:57.999 --> 41:59.907
No, that's right.
I forgot about that.

41:59.926 --> 42:02.260
Well, I guess you two are really
just a couple of crap magnets

42:02.354 --> 42:04.336
-then, ain't you?
-(laughter)

42:04.356 --> 42:06.022
Yeah, we do have
a good time, though.

42:06.173 --> 42:07.248
Yeah, I guess we do.

42:07.267 --> 42:08.733
(laughs):
You two are hopeless.

42:12.030 --> 42:13.271

You didn't have to wait up.

42:23.449 --> 42:25.208
Oh, gosh.

42:25.359 --> 42:27.877
So much for a night

You will never guess
where I just came from.

You got a runner, babe.
