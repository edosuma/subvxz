02:59.379 --> 03:02.181
I wish you wouldn't
do that around me.
It's so filthy!

03:02.182 --> 03:05.818
Don't give me a problem
about the cigarettes.
It's such a filthy habit.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.309
Oh, my God!

03:07.454 --> 03:08.944
Look at this.

03:10.791 --> 03:14.488
Oh, Jesus.
This is so appalling.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.696
I can't believe it.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.166
I can't believe
they gave it to him.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.441
Ah, this is pathetic.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.743
Now he's a loser
with a Jaguar.

03:30.744 --> 03:33.679
Seriously,
who did he have to blow
to get that thing?

03:35.649 --> 03:37.850
Good morning, sir.
Mr. Willis.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.285
It's really a...

03:39.286 --> 03:40.617
Mr. Trask!

03:41.188 --> 03:42.688
Quite a piece
of machinery.

03:42.689 --> 03:45.291
Good morning, Havemeyer.
Morning to you, sir.

03:45.292 --> 03:46.452
Bene!

03:46.660 --> 03:48.594
Bene?
Bene! Fabulous!

03:48.595 --> 03:49.962
What's fabulous?

03:49.963 --> 03:52.264
That fine piece of steel
you have back there.

03:52.265 --> 03:54.325
Ah, you don't think
I deserve it.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.669
No, sir.
On the contrary.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.704
I think
it's great.

03:58.705 --> 04:01.407
Why should the
headmaster of Baird
be seen putt-putting

04:01.408 --> 04:03.242
around in some junker?

04:03.243 --> 04:05.811
In fact, I think the
board of trustees have had

04:05.812 --> 04:09.181
their first true stroke
of inspiration in some time.

04:09.182 --> 04:11.684
Well, thank you,
Havemeyer.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.853
I'll take that at face value.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.947
I'd expect
nothing less, sir.

04:16.723 --> 04:18.350
Have a good day.

04:20.726 --> 04:22.661
Morning,
Mrs. Hunsaker.
Good morning.

04:22.662 --> 04:25.325
What have we here,
Murderer's Row?

04:32.038 --> 04:33.305
What was that about?

04:33.306 --> 04:34.840
Nothing. Just saying hello.

04:34.841 --> 04:37.037
I like to say hello
to Headmaster Trask.

04:38.044 --> 04:41.180
Sugarbush. Lift tickets
and condo vouchers.

04:41.181 --> 04:43.048
I thought we were
going to Stowe.

04:43.049 --> 04:45.084
Sugarbush
is Stowe, Jimmy.

04:45.085 --> 04:46.852
This year we're
doing it right.

04:46.853 --> 04:49.688
Thanksgiving in Vermont,
Christmas in Switzerland...

04:49.689 --> 04:51.924
Christmas in Gstaad
is gonna cost us...
"Staad."

04:51.925 --> 04:53.292
The "G" is silent.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.818
"Staad." George?

04:55.095 --> 04:56.495
"Staad."
Trent?

04:56.496 --> 04:58.798
"Staad," man.
So what about Staad?

04:58.799 --> 05:00.666
Fine. The "G" may
be silent,

05:00.667 --> 05:03.402
but it's gonna take at least
three grand to get there.

05:03.403 --> 05:05.104
I'll have to talk
to my father.

05:05.105 --> 05:07.873
Better yet,
have my father
talk to your father.

05:07.874 --> 05:09.843
Or my father
talk to your father.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.280
You going home
this weekend, Chas?

05:15.081 --> 05:17.283
I don't know.

05:17.284 --> 05:20.019
You going home
to fuckin' Idaho
for Thanksgiving?

05:20.020 --> 05:21.544
I'm from Oregon.

05:22.088 --> 05:24.356
I meant
fuckin' Oregon.

05:24.357 --> 05:26.392
Charlie, how do you
feel about skiing?

05:27.694 --> 05:30.459
You in the mood for
the white-bosomed
slopes of Vermont?

05:32.332 --> 05:33.832
Got a deal going.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.301
20% off for
my friends.

05:35.302 --> 05:36.835
My father set it up.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.337
Christmas
in Switzerland.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.673
Staad.
Gstaad.
Dropping the "G" is phony.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.308
You said
everybody
says "Staad."

05:42.309 --> 05:43.808
Not if you've
been there.

05:43.843 --> 05:47.213
Easter in Bermuda,
then Kentucky Derby
weekend.

05:47.214 --> 05:49.415
We could fit
you in, kid.

05:49.416 --> 05:53.352
Well, how much are
these white-bosomed
slopes of Vermont?

05:53.353 --> 05:55.354
1,200.

05:55.355 --> 05:59.625
Includes a nine-course,
champagne
Thanksgiving dinner.

05:59.626 --> 06:03.362
$1,200 is a little rich
for my blood, Harry.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.497
Well, how short
are you?

06:05.498 --> 06:07.666
How short, Harry?

06:07.667 --> 06:11.297
So short it wouldn't be
worth the trouble
of you and George to measure.

06:11.438 --> 06:12.972
But thanks for askin',
all right?

06:12.973 --> 06:14.440
Mmm-hmm.

06:14.441 --> 06:16.175
If you change
your mind...

06:16.176 --> 06:18.611
What'd you do that for?
You know he's on aid.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.112
On major
holidays, Willis,

06:20.113 --> 06:21.880
it's customary
for the lord of the manor

06:21.881 --> 06:23.182
to offer drippings
to the poor.

06:23.183 --> 06:24.582
You're so
full of shit!

06:51.678 --> 06:52.907
Hi. Mrs. Rossi?

06:53.213 --> 06:54.407
Yes?

06:54.681 --> 06:56.376
I'm here about
the weekend job.

06:58.285 --> 07:00.219
Come on in.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.960
Does he got pimples?
He hates pimples.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.561
Francine, be quiet.

07:09.562 --> 07:12.157
Pimples.
Pimples. Yeah.

07:12.365 --> 07:13.732
Shush!

07:13.733 --> 07:16.702
I'm sorry. The school
gave me your name,
but I've forgotten it.

07:16.703 --> 07:18.270
It's Charlie Simms.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.306
How are you,
Charlie?
Fine, thanks.

07:20.307 --> 07:21.467
Right this way.

07:25.312 --> 07:27.680
You're available
the whole weekend?

07:27.681 --> 07:28.981
Yeah.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.916
Not going home
for Thanksgiving?
No.

07:30.917 --> 07:32.180
Good.

07:34.421 --> 07:37.389
They put him in
a veteran's home,
but he hated it,

07:37.390 --> 07:39.518
so I told my dad
that we'd take him.

07:41.861 --> 07:44.997
Before you go in,
do you mind my
telling you a few things?

07:44.998 --> 07:48.935
Don't "sir" him
and don't ask him
too many questions.

07:49.436 --> 07:51.670
And if he
staggers a little
when he gets up,

07:51.671 --> 07:53.139
don't pay
any attention.

07:54.474 --> 07:58.433
Charlie,
I can tell you're
the right person for the job.

07:58.978 --> 08:01.209
And Uncle Frank's
gonna like you a lot, too.

08:03.216 --> 08:05.851
Where you gonna be
this weekend?

08:05.852 --> 08:08.014
We're driving to Albany.

08:08.655 --> 08:12.182
Donny, my husband,
has family there.

08:17.564 --> 08:19.331
Do you want
Tommy in or out?

08:19.332 --> 08:20.899
Leave him out!

08:20.900 --> 08:24.530
He's chasing that
Calico ginch from
the track houses again!

08:30.710 --> 08:33.543
Down deep, the man
is a lump of sugar.

08:53.733 --> 08:55.267
Sir?

08:55.268 --> 08:57.236
Don't call me sir.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.804
I'm sorry.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.506
I mean mister, sir.

09:00.507 --> 09:04.676
Uh-oh, we got a moron here,
is that it?

09:04.677 --> 09:06.245
No, mister...

09:06.246 --> 09:07.736
That is...

09:08.882 --> 09:11.717
Lieutenant.
Yes, sir...

09:11.718 --> 09:13.618
Lieutenant Colonel.

09:13.987 --> 09:17.855
Twenty-six years on the line,
nobody ever busted me
four grades before.

09:18.825 --> 09:20.452
Get in here,
you idiot!

09:27.434 --> 09:30.631
Come a little closer.
I wanna get a
better look at you.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.846
How's your skin, son?

09:42.649 --> 09:44.216
My skin, sir?

09:44.217 --> 09:45.951
Oh, for
Christ's sake.

09:45.952 --> 09:48.921
I'm sorry, I don...
Just call me Frank.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.756
Call me Mr. Slade.

09:50.757 --> 09:54.591
Call me Colonel,
if you must. Just don't
call me sir.

09:55.895 --> 09:57.727
All right, Colonel.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.033
Simms, Charles.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.401
A senior.

10:02.402 --> 10:04.269
You on
student aid, Simms?

10:04.270 --> 10:05.931
Yes, I am.

10:06.372 --> 10:08.341
For "student aid"
read "crook."

10:09.776 --> 10:13.111
Your father
peddles car telephones
at a 300% markup.

10:13.112 --> 10:15.948
Your mother works
on heavy commission
in a camera store.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.917
Graduated to it
from espresso machines.

10:25.658 --> 10:29.151
What are you, dying of
some wasting disease?

10:31.297 --> 10:33.288
No, I'm right...
I'm right here.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.731
I know exactly where
your body is.

10:37.103 --> 10:40.073
What I'm lookin' for
is some
indication of a brain.

10:41.107 --> 10:43.599
Too much football
without a helmet?

10:44.143 --> 10:47.477
Hah! Lyndon's line
on Gerry Ford.

10:48.882 --> 10:52.651
Deputy Debriefer, Paris,
Peace Talks, '66.

10:52.652 --> 10:56.714
Snagged the Silver Star
and a silver bar.
Threw me into G-2.

10:57.524 --> 10:58.824
G-2?

10:58.825 --> 11:01.988
Intelligence,
of which you have none.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.598
Where you from?

11:08.268 --> 11:09.792
Gresham, Oregon,

11:11.838 --> 11:13.071
Colonel.

11:13.072 --> 11:15.632
What does your daddy do
in Gresham, Oregon?

11:16.142 --> 11:18.076
Hmm?
Count wood chips?

11:19.212 --> 11:23.081
My stepfather and my mom
run a convenience store.

11:23.082 --> 11:26.143
How convenient.
What time they open?

11:27.020 --> 11:28.187
5:00 a.m.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.246
Close?

11:29.489 --> 11:30.756
1:00 a.m.

11:30.757 --> 11:32.658
Hard workers.

11:32.659 --> 11:34.559
You got me all
misty-eyed!

11:38.865 --> 11:41.698
So, what are you doing here
in this sparrow-fart town?

11:42.802 --> 11:44.930
I attend Baird.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.896
Attend Baird!

11:49.309 --> 11:52.010
I know you go
to the Baird school.

11:52.011 --> 11:55.047
Point is,
how do you afford it,

11:55.048 --> 11:59.747
even with the student aid
and the folks back home
hustlin' corn nuts?

12:01.154 --> 12:04.990
I won a Young American
merit scholarship.

12:04.991 --> 12:06.823
Hoo-ah!

12:08.661 --> 12:12.120
Glory, glory
Hallelujah

12:12.665 --> 12:16.124
Glory, glory
Hallelujah

12:20.440 --> 12:21.532
Who's there?

12:22.208 --> 12:23.938
That little
piece of tail?

12:27.213 --> 12:29.081
Get her outta here!

12:37.657 --> 12:39.022
Yeah.

12:40.827 --> 12:42.818
Can't believe
they're my blood.

12:48.167 --> 12:52.204
IQ of sloths and
the manners of banshees.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.806
He's a mechanic,
she's a homemaker.

12:54.807 --> 12:57.276
He knows as much about cars
as a beauty queen,

12:57.277 --> 13:00.337
and she bakes cookies,
taste like wing nuts.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.845
As for the tots,
they're twits.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.484
How's your skin, son?
I like my aides
to be presentable.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.324
Well, I...

13:12.325 --> 13:14.020
I've had a few zits.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.663
But my roommate,
he lent me his Clinique

13:17.664 --> 13:20.032
because he's from
Chestnut Hill
and he's got...

13:20.033 --> 13:22.695
"The History of My Skin,"
by Charles Simms.

13:24.003 --> 13:26.597
You patronizing me,
peewee? Hmm?

13:27.373 --> 13:30.104
You givin' me
that old prep school
palaver?

13:31.444 --> 13:32.673
Baird School!

13:34.247 --> 13:37.649
A bunch of runny-nosed
snots in tweed jackets

13:37.650 --> 13:40.176
all studyin'
to be George Bush.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.356
Well...

13:44.357 --> 13:47.053
I believe President Bush
went to Andover, Colonel.

13:50.463 --> 13:52.795
You sharpshootin'
me, punk?

13:54.233 --> 13:56.259
Is that what
you're doin'?

13:57.236 --> 13:59.571
Don't you
sharpshoot me.

13:59.572 --> 14:02.107
You'll give me 40.

14:02.108 --> 14:04.743
Then you're gonna give me
40 more.

14:04.744 --> 14:08.480
Then you're gonna
pull K.P.,
the grease pit!

14:08.481 --> 14:12.317
I'll rub your nose
in enlisted men's crud

14:12.318 --> 14:14.252
till you don't
know which end is up!

14:14.854 --> 14:16.117
You understand?

14:17.457 --> 14:18.657
Yeah.

14:18.658 --> 14:19.989
What do you want?

14:20.159 --> 14:22.160
What do you mean,
what do I want?

14:22.161 --> 14:23.595
What do you want here?

14:26.199 --> 14:28.030
I want a job.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.769
A job!

14:30.770 --> 14:33.004
Yeah, I want a job
so I can make, you know,

14:33.005 --> 14:35.770
my plane fare home
for Christmas.

14:36.743 --> 14:39.803
Oh, God,
you're touching!

14:52.225 --> 14:55.327
They used to waltz on the banks

14:55.328 --> 14:58.764
Of the mighty Mississippi

14:58.765 --> 15:02.565
Loving the whole
night through

15:04.003 --> 15:07.639
Till the riverboat gambler

15:07.640 --> 15:10.709
Went off to make a killin'

15:10.710 --> 15:13.645
And bring it on back to you

15:14.747 --> 15:16.648
Still here, poormouth?

15:16.649 --> 15:17.946
Hmm?

15:19.419 --> 15:21.353
Convenience store,

15:21.354 --> 15:22.617
my ass!

15:23.856 --> 15:27.918
Hustlin' jalapeno dips
to the appleseeds.

15:29.028 --> 15:30.621
Go on.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.921
Dismissed.

15:36.035 --> 15:37.526
Dismissed!

15:45.244 --> 15:48.180
Evangeline

15:48.181 --> 15:50.945
Evangeline

15:51.684 --> 15:53.985
Mrs. Rossi?

15:53.986 --> 15:56.512
Charlie, we're up here!
Come on up.

15:58.925 --> 16:01.416
This is Donny.
Hey, Charlie.

16:01.861 --> 16:03.090
Hi.

16:03.496 --> 16:06.465
Mrs. Rossi, I got
the feelin' I screwed up.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.900
Oh, you couldn't have.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.502
It was a
bad interview.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.471
That was no interview,
Charlie. You're it.

16:12.772 --> 16:15.874
You're the only
one that showed up.
You have to take the job.

16:15.875 --> 16:20.506
He sleeps a lot. You can
watch television,
call your girlfriend.

16:21.180 --> 16:23.114
I promise you,
an easy 300 bucks.

16:24.183 --> 16:26.709
I don't get
an easy feeling.

16:30.356 --> 16:32.324
His bark is worse
than his bite.

16:33.459 --> 16:36.827
He was a great soldier,
a real hero.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.465
The man grows on you.

16:40.466 --> 16:42.560
By Sunday night,
you'll be best friends.

16:43.870 --> 16:46.566
Charlie, please.

16:47.273 --> 16:49.774
I want to get
away with my husband
for a few days,

16:49.775 --> 16:51.710
and Uncle Frank
won't come with us.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.580
Six months ago,
he could sometimes tell
light from dark,

16:55.581 --> 16:57.549
but now there's nothing.

16:57.550 --> 17:00.576
I just feel better
having someone else
around just in case.

17:07.226 --> 17:08.522
Please?

17:11.797 --> 17:12.992
Okay, Mrs. Rossi.

17:13.432 --> 17:14.559
Sure.

17:14.733 --> 17:17.002
Thank you, Charlie.

17:17.002 --> 17:18.435
Come here, you.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.546
There you go.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.914
Chas. Chas, hold up.

17:32.451 --> 17:34.686
How you doin'?
I'm good.

17:34.687 --> 17:35.984
That's great.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.615
This can't go out.
This is on reserve.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.956
Here's the thing.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.822
I need the book tonight

17:47.667 --> 17:50.535
for a Thanksgiving quiz
with big-shit Preston
in the morning.

17:50.536 --> 17:52.971
Yeah, I know.
That's why he
put it on reserve.

17:52.972 --> 17:54.339
This is our only copy.

17:54.340 --> 17:56.775
Chas, I'm pullin'
an all-nighter.

17:56.776 --> 17:59.438
Without that book
I'm dead, okay?

18:01.414 --> 18:04.916
If it's not back
by 7:30, it's gonna
be my ass.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.011
Oh, I promise.
I promise.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.919
Got it?
Yeah.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.876
Just a second.
I gotta lock up.

18:39.518 --> 18:40.884
Okay.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.117
God, can you wait
to get out of this
dump or what?

18:50.763 --> 18:53.631
Where you guys
going skiing again?
Sugarloaf or...

18:53.632 --> 18:55.567
It's bush, Chas,
Sugarbush.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.445
That's my boys.

19:07.446 --> 19:09.481
What are you doin'?

19:09.482 --> 19:12.450
Keep your voice down!

19:12.451 --> 19:14.786
I'll tell you about it
in the morning.

19:17.423 --> 19:18.788
What...

19:19.759 --> 19:21.359
Mrs. Hunsaker,
have a nice day?

19:21.360 --> 19:23.128
George, why
all the noise?

19:24.797 --> 19:27.632
It's Hunsaker! Go! Go!

19:27.633 --> 19:29.801
I was just
messin' around with Chas.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.069
Good evening, Charles.

19:31.070 --> 19:32.435
Hi, Mrs. Hunsaker.

19:38.210 --> 19:40.372
What was that?
I don't know, ma'am.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.147
Who were
those boys?

19:42.148 --> 19:43.945
Oh, who knows?
What were they doing?

19:44.183 --> 19:45.878
Charles?

19:46.285 --> 19:47.619
Um...

19:47.620 --> 19:49.687
Did you make this
scarf yourself?

19:49.688 --> 19:51.289
No, George,
I bought it.

19:51.290 --> 19:54.092
'Cause it's a beauty.
It really is.
Thank you, George.

19:54.093 --> 19:56.824
In case I don't
see you before
the Thanksgiving holidays,

19:57.263 --> 19:58.930
why don't you give me
one of your big hugs?

19:58.931 --> 20:00.432
Oh, George!
Please?

20:00.433 --> 20:01.933
Good evening, boys.
Come on.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.334
Goodbye,
Mrs. Hunsaker.

20:25.157 --> 20:28.059
Mr. Trask is our
fearless leader,

20:29.361 --> 20:32.422
a man of learning,
a voracious reader.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.865
He could recite the lliad
in ancient Greek

20:38.003 --> 20:41.371
while fishing for trout
in a rippling creek.

20:42.675 --> 20:46.702
Endowed with wisdom,
of judgment sound,

20:47.279 --> 20:51.216
nevertheless about him
the questions abound.

20:57.056 --> 21:00.617
How does Mr. Trask
make such wonderful deals?

21:01.193 --> 21:04.789
Why did the trustees
buy him Jaguar wheels?

21:05.798 --> 21:07.561
He wasn't conniving.

21:08.134 --> 21:10.235
He wasn't crass.

21:10.236 --> 21:12.602
He merely
puckered his lips

21:15.441 --> 21:17.809
and kissed their ass!

21:36.128 --> 21:37.562
Come on.

21:37.696 --> 21:39.130
Come on.

21:43.536 --> 21:44.736
One more.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.034
One more, come on!

22:05.825 --> 22:07.224
Fuck you!

22:14.066 --> 22:17.434
Mr. Simms, Mr. Willis.

22:18.103 --> 22:19.196
Hmm.

22:20.639 --> 22:22.941
Mrs. Hunsaker says
that you gentlemen

22:22.942 --> 22:24.909
were at a vantage
point last night

22:24.910 --> 22:28.346
to observe who was
responsible for this

22:29.381 --> 22:30.678
stunt.

22:36.622 --> 22:37.953
Who was it?

22:39.091 --> 22:41.116
I really couldn't
tell you, sir.

22:42.795 --> 22:45.897
I thought I saw
someone fooling
with the lamppost,

22:45.898 --> 22:50.335
but by the time
I pulled focus,
they were gone.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.701
Mr. Simms?

22:54.506 --> 22:55.997
I couldn't say.

22:58.244 --> 23:02.313
That automobile
is not just a
possession of mine.

23:02.314 --> 23:07.252
That automobile was
presented to me by
the board of trustees.

23:07.253 --> 23:10.321
It is a symbol of
the standard of
excellence

23:10.322 --> 23:12.557
for which this
school is known,

23:12.558 --> 23:15.288
and I will not
have it tarnished.

23:16.328 --> 23:17.728
The automobile?

23:19.698 --> 23:21.826
The standard,
Mr. Willis.

23:25.371 --> 23:27.396
What's your position,
Mr. Simms?

23:28.240 --> 23:29.641
On what, sir?

23:29.642 --> 23:31.906
On preserving the
reputation of Baird.

23:32.177 --> 23:33.907
I'm for Baird.

23:34.446 --> 23:35.914
Then, who did it?

23:37.249 --> 23:39.377
I really
couldn't say for sure.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.582
Very well.

23:54.099 --> 23:56.768
First thing Monday,
I'm convening
a special session

23:56.769 --> 23:59.103
of the student-faculty
disciplinary committee.

23:59.104 --> 24:01.873
As this is a matter
which concerns
the whole school,

24:01.874 --> 24:04.776
the entire student body
will be present.

24:04.777 --> 24:07.412
There will be
no classes,
no activities.

24:07.413 --> 24:09.981
Nothing will
transpire at
this institution

24:09.982 --> 24:12.917
until that proceeding
is concluded.

24:15.154 --> 24:18.419
And if, at that time,
we are no further
along than we are now,

24:20.526 --> 24:22.323
I will expel you both.

24:27.666 --> 24:30.294
Mr. Willis,
would you excuse us?

24:34.773 --> 24:36.366
Have a nice Thanksgiving.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.877
Thank you.
You, too, Mr. Willis.

24:39.878 --> 24:41.175
I will.

24:49.321 --> 24:50.584
Mr. Simms,

24:52.691 --> 24:54.887
I'm not quite through
with you yet.

25:03.702 --> 25:06.504
One of the few perks
of this office is that

25:06.505 --> 25:11.636
I am empowered to handle
certain matters on
my own as I see fit.

25:13.479 --> 25:15.213
Do you understand?

25:15.214 --> 25:16.772
Yes, sir.
Good.

25:17.249 --> 25:20.451
The Dean of
Admissions at Harvard
and I have an arrangement.

25:20.452 --> 25:23.821
Along with the usual
sheaf of applicants
submitted by Baird,

25:23.822 --> 25:25.890
of which virtually

25:25.891 --> 25:28.861
two-thirds are
guaranteed admittance,

25:29.661 --> 25:31.653
I add one name,

25:33.265 --> 25:36.860
somebody who's a standout
and yet underprivileged.

25:38.036 --> 25:40.338
A student who
cannot afford to pay

25:40.339 --> 25:42.205
the board and
tuition in Cambridge.

25:44.810 --> 25:48.371
Do you know on whose behalf
I drafted a memo this year?

25:49.581 --> 25:50.648
No, sir.

25:50.649 --> 25:51.878
You.

25:52.851 --> 25:54.410
You, Mr. Simms.

25:57.656 --> 25:59.886
Now can you tell me
who did it?

26:02.428 --> 26:03.918
No, sir, I can't.

26:05.297 --> 26:08.164
You take the weekend
to think about it, Mr. Simms.

26:10.636 --> 26:12.468
Good afternoon.

26:15.474 --> 26:16.964
What'd he say?

26:17.443 --> 26:19.644
Nothin'.
What do you
mean, nothing?

26:19.645 --> 26:21.179
He said the
same thing.

26:21.180 --> 26:22.447
He just said
it over.

26:22.448 --> 26:24.182
You know what
he's doing?

26:24.183 --> 26:26.913
He's good-cop,
bad-coppin' us.

26:27.486 --> 26:29.754
He knows I'm old guard.
You're fringe.

26:29.755 --> 26:32.349
He's gonna bear down on me
and soft-soap you.

26:33.459 --> 26:36.594
Did he try to
soft-soap you?

26:36.595 --> 26:37.756
Did he?

26:38.564 --> 26:39.656
No.

26:40.799 --> 26:44.035
Chas, I detect a slight
panic pulse from you.
Are you panicking?

26:44.036 --> 26:45.536
Yeah, a little.

26:45.537 --> 26:47.699
Come on.
You're on
scholarship, right?

26:48.907 --> 26:50.074
Yeah.

26:50.075 --> 26:53.170
You're on scholarship
from Oregon at Baird.

26:54.513 --> 26:56.709
You're a long way
from home, Chas.

26:57.382 --> 26:59.510
What's that got
to do with anything?

27:00.018 --> 27:02.420
I don't know how
it works out there.

27:02.421 --> 27:04.088
But how it
works here?

27:04.089 --> 27:05.819
We stick together.

27:05.991 --> 27:08.459
It's us against them,
no matter what.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.361
We don't cover our ass.

27:10.362 --> 27:12.463
We don't tell our parents.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.159
Stonewall everybody!

27:15.300 --> 27:17.168
And above all,

27:17.169 --> 27:19.971
never, ever

27:19.972 --> 27:23.101
leave any of us
twisting in the wind.

27:24.843 --> 27:26.611
And that's it.

27:26.612 --> 27:29.380
What does that have
to do with me being
on scholarship?

27:29.381 --> 27:31.315
Hey, hey.

27:31.316 --> 27:34.081
I'm just tryin' to
bring you up to speed,
kid, that's it.

27:35.287 --> 27:36.618
Thanks.

27:39.758 --> 27:43.353
I'll tell you what.
Give me a few hours
to figure out the moves,

27:44.029 --> 27:45.690
and call me tonight
in Vermont.

27:47.533 --> 27:50.768
I'll be at
the Sugarbush lodge,
all right?

27:50.769 --> 27:51.930
All right.

27:53.405 --> 27:54.873
You all right?

27:56.074 --> 27:57.633
Yeah, I guess so.

27:59.144 --> 28:00.441
Okay.

28:03.048 --> 28:05.383
Try to keep him down
to four drinks a day.

28:05.384 --> 28:08.319
If you can keep
him down to 40,
you're doin' good.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.955
We try to water
them down a little.
Do you know how to do that?

28:10.956 --> 28:12.924
It's a long ride,
honey.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.560
Get the bags in the car.
I'll be right out.

28:15.561 --> 28:19.190
Mommy, Mommy,
don't forget
Uncle Frank's walk.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.959
Oh, yeah.

28:23.769 --> 28:28.035
You have to air him
out a little every day.

28:29.942 --> 28:32.610
Why don't you
go on back there,
get yourself oriented?

28:32.611 --> 28:35.672
I'll come out in a minute,
give you telephone
numbers and stuff.

28:37.616 --> 28:39.951
Well, I wouldn't
try a thing like that

28:39.952 --> 28:42.119
unless I knew, would I?

28:42.120 --> 28:43.816
Just let me
speak to her.

28:44.189 --> 28:46.257
Hello, beautiful.
Is that you?

28:46.258 --> 28:48.317
Yeah,
we spoke yesterday.

28:51.029 --> 28:52.763
You have a glass
of wine with lunch?

28:52.764 --> 28:54.699
You sound
a little dusky. Hmm.

28:57.336 --> 28:59.236
Just a minute,
sweetheart.

29:00.872 --> 29:02.363
You're back, huh?

29:03.609 --> 29:05.009
Tenacious!

29:05.010 --> 29:08.079
Get out my dress blues.
They're in a garment bag
in the closet.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.714
Check the
top dresser drawer.

29:09.715 --> 29:11.315
Take out
the shoulder boards

29:11.316 --> 29:13.184
and affix them,
shoulders
right and left,

29:13.185 --> 29:15.654
ASAP. That means now.

29:16.855 --> 29:18.456
Hello.

29:18.457 --> 29:21.392
Sorry to keep you
waiting, sweetheart.

29:21.393 --> 29:24.095
I'm not the kind of guy
who likes to rush things,

29:24.096 --> 29:27.064
but I'm catchin'
a 4:00 at Logan,
I'm lookin' out my window,

29:27.065 --> 29:28.829
and there's
not a taxi in sight.

29:30.068 --> 29:31.535
What happened
to Chet?

29:31.536 --> 29:33.334
He didn't invest
in a radio yet?

29:33.905 --> 29:36.875
Hah! Well,
get your driver on it.

29:38.343 --> 29:40.711
Tell him to get
a move on.

29:40.712 --> 29:43.238
Yes. Mmm.

29:44.416 --> 29:47.918
Some kind of body
has got to go with
that bedroom voice.

29:47.919 --> 29:50.411
One day I'm gonna swing by,
get a better look at it.

29:51.089 --> 29:52.216
You bet.

29:54.159 --> 29:55.422
Bye.

29:58.163 --> 30:00.298
My Valpak's
underneath the bed.

30:00.299 --> 30:01.799
Get it out.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.360
Put the boards
on the blues
and fold 'em in.

30:05.537 --> 30:08.105
Are we going
someplace, Colonel?

30:08.106 --> 30:09.767
What business is
that of yours?

30:10.542 --> 30:12.710
Don't shrug, imbecile.
I'm blind.

30:12.711 --> 30:15.112
Save your body language
for the bimbi.

30:15.981 --> 30:17.449
Now, get my gear out.

30:18.717 --> 30:21.083
Francine, get in the car.

30:21.520 --> 30:25.286
It's almost 3:00.
The goddamn Flintstones
haven't left yet.

30:25.891 --> 30:28.951
Willie Rossi
must go in the car.

30:30.629 --> 30:32.263
Here comes
Mrs. Rossi now.

30:32.264 --> 30:33.493
Damn it!

30:34.266 --> 30:36.428
She said goodbye to me
three times today.

30:37.803 --> 30:40.137
What has she got,
separation anxiety?

30:40.138 --> 30:41.970
Cut her off
at the door.

30:44.743 --> 30:46.472
Hi, honey.
Bye, honey.

30:51.049 --> 30:52.676
I wish you were
coming with us.

30:53.285 --> 30:54.618
Me, too.

30:54.619 --> 30:55.985
Maybe next time.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.193
Drive carefully now.

31:02.194 --> 31:03.388
Yeah.

31:04.830 --> 31:07.264
Charlie, this is
where we'll be.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.636
Good luck, Charlie.
Don't let him
drink too much.

31:15.841 --> 31:17.365
See you, Charlie.

31:18.243 --> 31:20.974
And no 000 numbers.
He loves to talk dirty.

31:29.454 --> 31:31.514
All right,
let's get to work.

31:40.799 --> 31:42.699
L- buckles
givin' you trouble?

31:44.736 --> 31:47.004
Never in the
Boy Scouts, sluggo?

31:47.005 --> 31:48.773
I made Tenderfoot.

31:48.774 --> 31:50.708
Tenderfoot,
my foot!

31:50.709 --> 31:53.007
Convenience store
mama's boy.

31:53.145 --> 31:55.045
Here. Let me
take a look
at that.

31:55.981 --> 31:59.383
Touch me again,
I'll kill you,
you little son of a bitch!

32:00.652 --> 32:02.143
I touch you.

32:04.256 --> 32:05.553
Understand?

32:07.959 --> 32:12.021
My shoulder boards are
in the top dresser drawer.
Get them, son.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.588
The epaulets with
the silver oak leaf.

32:33.084 --> 32:34.785
Are these the...

32:34.786 --> 32:36.584
Good.
Taxi come yet?

32:38.023 --> 32:40.491
Colonel,
where are we going?

32:40.492 --> 32:42.526
Where are we going?

32:42.527 --> 32:44.795
Freak show central.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.765
Where's that?
New York City.

32:49.601 --> 32:51.168
That's in New York, son.

32:51.169 --> 32:53.160
New York State.

32:53.371 --> 32:56.207
Mrs. Rossi didn't say
anything to me
about going anywhere.

32:56.208 --> 32:57.436
She forgot.

32:58.643 --> 33:00.344
Should we call her,
'cause I...

33:00.345 --> 33:02.012
You kidding me?

33:02.013 --> 33:04.148
Call her? By the time
they get to Albany

33:04.149 --> 33:05.816
in that Hupmobile
he drives

33:05.817 --> 33:08.047
it'll be opening day
at Saratoga.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.454
Colonel, I can't go
to New York City.

33:10.455 --> 33:11.582
Why not?

33:12.891 --> 33:14.290
New York...

33:14.759 --> 33:16.694
New York's too
much responsibility.

33:16.695 --> 33:18.596
Ah, responsibility!

33:18.597 --> 33:21.398
I had a lot
of 17-year-olds
in my first platoon.

33:21.399 --> 33:23.629
I took care of them.
All set!

33:26.071 --> 33:27.334
How do I look?

33:29.274 --> 33:30.969
Tickets. Money.

33:31.610 --> 33:32.838
Speech.

33:33.678 --> 33:37.012
Old Washington joke
from my days with Lyndon.

33:39.317 --> 33:41.385
I knew I could
count on transportation.

33:41.386 --> 33:42.717
Are you ready?

33:45.257 --> 33:47.817
This is not Panmunjom.
A simple yes will do.

33:48.927 --> 33:50.622
Um...
Good! Here you go.

33:50.996 --> 33:52.554
Come on!
Hop to, son!

33:53.965 --> 33:55.695
You're in front of me.
Let's go.

33:57.602 --> 33:59.400
Tomster,
come here, boy.

34:01.339 --> 34:02.606
Come on.

34:02.607 --> 34:04.642
Here, Tomster, come on.

34:04.643 --> 34:06.941
Tomster, Tomster. Yeah.

34:08.179 --> 34:11.274
Remember, when in doubt,

34:11.983 --> 34:13.110
fuck.

34:16.454 --> 34:18.889
Good afternoon, sir.
Where's our destination?

34:18.889 --> 34:22.126
Our destination
New York City,
home of the brave!

34:22.127 --> 34:24.194
We got two for
the shuttle
to New York.

34:24.195 --> 34:27.231
I'm not shuttling anywhere.
Look at those tickets.
First class.

34:27.232 --> 34:29.033
Yes, sir,
first class.

34:29.034 --> 34:31.101
Colonel,
you bought me
a ticket?

34:31.101 --> 34:32.870
I never said I'd
go to New York.

34:32.871 --> 34:34.905
What are you,
some kind of
chicken-shit,

34:34.906 --> 34:36.907
sticks to job
description only?

34:36.908 --> 34:38.842
Gate 46, sir.

34:38.842 --> 34:40.444
As you were, son.

34:40.445 --> 34:42.045
Thank you, sir.

34:42.047 --> 34:43.480
Which way's the door?

34:44.649 --> 34:47.751
Are you blind?
Are you blind?

34:47.752 --> 34:49.085
Of course not.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.556
Then why do you keep grabbin'
my goddamn arm?

34:51.989 --> 34:54.219
I take your arm.

34:58.763 --> 35:00.831
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.

35:00.832 --> 35:03.467
How would you know,
watchin' MTV all your life?

35:03.468 --> 35:05.562
Gentlemen?
Yeah!

35:08.173 --> 35:10.266
Jack Daniels.
You bet.

35:12.243 --> 35:14.144
And Diet Slice.

35:14.145 --> 35:15.479
The old Diet Slice.

35:15.480 --> 35:16.947
And a water.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.144
Thank you,
Daphne.
Certainly, sir.

35:26.591 --> 35:28.651
Mmm!
How did you
know her name?

35:30.962 --> 35:33.625
Well, she's
wearin' Floris.

35:34.566 --> 35:36.432
That's an
English cologne.

35:37.635 --> 35:40.935
But her voice is
California chickie.

35:41.740 --> 35:44.868
Now, California chickie
bucking for English lady.

35:45.677 --> 35:47.110
I call her Daphne.

35:49.347 --> 35:53.011
Oh, big things may
happen to that
little thing of yours.

35:55.253 --> 35:56.516
Look, Colonel,

35:58.356 --> 36:00.657
I'll get you to New York,
all right?
Uh-huh.

36:00.658 --> 36:03.423
Then I'm gonna have
to turn around and come back.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.293
Well, Chuck,
you gotta do
what you gotta do.

36:07.298 --> 36:08.789
Charlie, all right?

36:09.334 --> 36:10.667
Or Charles.

36:10.668 --> 36:13.037
Sorry.
I can't blame you, though.

36:13.038 --> 36:14.300
Chuck is a...

36:18.109 --> 36:20.411
So, why are we
going to New York?

36:20.412 --> 36:23.973
All information will be given
on a need-to-know basis.

36:25.417 --> 36:26.509
Hoo-ah!

36:27.318 --> 36:29.514
Where's Daphne?
Let's get her down here.

36:32.490 --> 36:34.049
She's in the back.

36:34.759 --> 36:36.193
A tail's in the tail.

36:37.595 --> 36:38.756
Hah!

36:39.531 --> 36:41.131
Oh, but I still smell her.

36:45.070 --> 36:46.230
Women.

36:47.639 --> 36:49.300
What can you say?

36:50.775 --> 36:52.266
Who made 'em?

36:53.478 --> 36:55.970
God must have been
a fuckin' genius.

37:00.351 --> 37:01.717
The hair...

37:03.054 --> 37:05.250
They say the hair
is everything, you know.

37:07.325 --> 37:11.057
Have you ever
buried your nose
in a mountain of curis

37:11.496 --> 37:14.625
and just wanted
to go to sleep forever?

37:16.367 --> 37:17.835
Or lips,

37:20.071 --> 37:22.206
and when they touched,
yours were like

37:22.207 --> 37:25.370
that first swallow of wine

37:25.910 --> 37:27.901
after you just crossed
the desert.

37:32.050 --> 37:33.484
Tits!

37:33.485 --> 37:34.679
Hoo-ah.

37:35.687 --> 37:38.179
Big ones, little ones,

37:39.124 --> 37:41.525
nipples staring
right out at you

37:41.526 --> 37:43.654
like secret searchlights.

37:44.696 --> 37:45.925
Mmm.

37:48.500 --> 37:49.728
And legs...

37:51.236 --> 37:54.228
I don't care if
they're Greek columns

37:54.606 --> 37:56.472
or secondhand Steinways.

37:58.009 --> 37:59.409
What's between 'em,

38:01.613 --> 38:03.171
passport to heaven.

38:05.083 --> 38:06.642
I need a drink.

38:10.622 --> 38:11.987
Yes, Mr. Simms,

38:13.992 --> 38:18.292
there's only two syllables
in this whole wide
world worth hearing.

38:23.868 --> 38:25.097
Pussy.

38:26.171 --> 38:27.468
Hah!

38:28.006 --> 38:30.908
Are you listening to me, son?
I'm givin' you pearis here.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.711
I guess you
really like women.

38:34.712 --> 38:37.238
Oh, above all things!

38:43.154 --> 38:46.556
A very, very
distant second

38:48.593 --> 38:49.890
is a Ferrari.

38:57.769 --> 38:58.895
Charlie?

39:01.873 --> 39:03.170
Give me your hand.

39:05.410 --> 39:08.277
This is just the start
of your education, son.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.390
Hoo-ah.

39:25.964 --> 39:27.431
Where are we?

39:27.432 --> 39:28.899
Where are we, eh?

39:29.467 --> 39:32.528
The cynosure of
all things civilized.

39:32.737 --> 39:34.637
The Waldorf-Astoria.

39:35.874 --> 39:39.443
The last time I
was here, Charlie,
was with a G-2 from Brussels.

39:39.444 --> 39:40.944
Had a Ferrari.

39:40.945 --> 39:44.314
Every day I
held the door open
for the fucker.

39:44.315 --> 39:46.583
Never even
offered me a ride.

39:46.584 --> 39:48.585
Well, fuck him.

39:48.586 --> 39:50.680
He's dead and I'm blind.

39:54.525 --> 39:56.093
Spread the word.

39:56.094 --> 39:57.327
Thank you, sir.

39:57.328 --> 39:59.363
And the intelligence
will be forthcoming?

39:59.364 --> 40:00.597
Sir?

40:00.598 --> 40:01.998
On the
escort scene.

40:02.667 --> 40:04.533
Yes, sir.

40:05.036 --> 40:07.070
And welcome to
the Waldorf.

40:07.071 --> 40:08.403
Gracias, amigo.

40:10.241 --> 40:11.775
Puerto Ricans.

40:11.776 --> 40:13.608
Always made
the best infantrymen.

40:21.119 --> 40:22.245
Oh!

40:29.360 --> 40:30.521
I'm home again.

40:31.562 --> 40:33.724
Give me an inventory
on this, will you?

40:39.904 --> 40:42.039
All right, where am I,
in Asia?

40:42.040 --> 40:45.242
He told me the phone
was on the other side
of the room, didn't he?

40:45.243 --> 40:46.608
By the windows?

40:48.146 --> 40:49.443
It's right here.

40:51.215 --> 40:52.547
Okay.

40:53.351 --> 40:54.614
We're in business.

40:59.590 --> 41:00.922
Get me the Oak Room.

41:02.527 --> 41:04.689
How's that inventory
comin'?

41:05.830 --> 41:08.665
There's Jim Beam

41:08.666 --> 41:11.234
and Early Times.

41:11.235 --> 41:13.067
Quartermaster's
on the take again.

41:13.504 --> 41:16.235
Hello. Is Sheldon
or Mack there?

41:17.975 --> 41:20.477
This is Lieutenant
Colonel Frank Slade.

41:20.478 --> 41:23.846
I used to be a regular.
I used to come in
with a General Garbisch.

41:26.017 --> 41:29.219
Yes, that's
probably because he's at
Arlington, six feet under.

41:29.220 --> 41:32.713
Listen up.
I want a table for two,
and I don't mean Siberia,

41:33.191 --> 41:34.283
15.

41:35.593 --> 41:37.494
Clear them little
bottles off.

41:37.495 --> 41:41.331
And when I get
off the phone,
call up Hyman.

41:41.332 --> 41:44.268
Tell him I want it
wall to wall
with John Daniels.

41:44.802 --> 41:47.738
Don't you mean
Jack Daniels?

41:47.739 --> 41:51.608
He may be Jack to you, son.
But when you've known him
as long as I have...

41:51.609 --> 41:53.076
That's a joke. Hello!

41:53.077 --> 41:56.179
This is Lieutenant
Colonel Frank Slade.
I would like a limo,

41:56.180 --> 41:57.512
00.

42:04.522 --> 42:06.490
What are you drinkin'?

42:06.491 --> 42:09.726
Nothing, thanks.
I don't use it.

42:09.727 --> 42:11.559
What's useful about it?

42:13.131 --> 42:16.430
I don't know.
Listen, Colonel,
I have to get going.

42:17.335 --> 42:18.935
Where you goin'?

42:18.936 --> 42:20.871
Back to school.
I've got some real

42:20.872 --> 42:22.999
important stuff I
have to take care of.

42:23.908 --> 42:25.399
Very well.

42:26.411 --> 42:29.679
But I never let
my aides leave
on an empty stomach.

42:29.680 --> 42:33.216
You'll dine with me
and then my driver
will transport you

42:33.217 --> 42:36.278
to the airport for
the Boston shuttle
departing at 2200 hours.

42:37.855 --> 42:41.257
Meanwhile,
unpack my bag.

42:41.759 --> 42:43.386
I'm gonna christen
the latrine.

42:45.963 --> 42:47.898
What's your name,
driver?

42:47.899 --> 42:49.099
Manny, sir.

42:49.100 --> 42:51.968
Manny. The bellhops
at the Waldorf,

42:51.969 --> 42:54.137
are they any good
at getting escorts?

42:54.138 --> 42:56.206
I wouldn't know, sir.

42:56.207 --> 42:57.741
What would you know?

42:57.742 --> 42:59.643
About what?

42:59.644 --> 43:01.339
About you-know-what?

43:02.880 --> 43:05.582
Maybe I could
manage something.

43:05.583 --> 43:08.018
I'm talkin'
top of the line, now.

43:08.019 --> 43:09.748
Let me think
about this, sir.

43:18.463 --> 43:20.997
What's the matter
with you?

43:20.998 --> 43:22.299
With me?

43:22.300 --> 43:25.001
Yeah. Car feels heavy.
You know why?

43:25.002 --> 43:27.870
You got the fuckin'
weight of the world
on your shoulders.

43:32.376 --> 43:34.678
I got a little problem
at school, that's all.

43:34.679 --> 43:36.046
Spit it out!

43:36.047 --> 43:37.714
It's not a big deal,
all right?

43:37.715 --> 43:39.783
Where we going,
the Oak Room
or somethin'?

43:39.784 --> 43:42.586
If it's not a big deal,
why did you say
real important stuff?

43:42.587 --> 43:44.754
What are you doin',
banging the dean's daughter?

43:44.755 --> 43:45.882
Hah!

43:48.092 --> 43:49.960
I'm just in
a little trouble.

43:49.961 --> 43:51.394
What kind of trouble?

43:52.129 --> 43:54.064
I saw some guys
doing something.

43:56.934 --> 44:00.336
To tell or not to tell,
or it's your ass.

44:00.938 --> 44:02.201
Hmm?

44:04.142 --> 44:05.408
How'd you know that?

44:05.409 --> 44:08.038
I'm a wizard.
Give me the details,
come on.

44:14.318 --> 44:16.319
There's this guy
at school named Harry.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.787
He's this
real rich kid,

44:17.788 --> 44:20.155
and he like,
runs the show.

44:20.958 --> 44:22.255
Who else?

44:23.761 --> 44:28.064
There's another guy, George,
but George didn't do anything.

44:28.065 --> 44:32.035
George and I saw
Harry and his buddies
doin' somethin'.

44:32.036 --> 44:34.170
Now, the folks at Baird,

44:34.171 --> 44:37.300
they know you and George
can identify
the guilty parties?

44:40.778 --> 44:42.379
Yeah, they think we can.

44:42.380 --> 44:44.348
George is
a friend of yours.

44:45.483 --> 44:47.317
He's not a friend,
but he's all right.

44:47.318 --> 44:48.717
You trust him?

44:49.587 --> 44:50.816
Yeah, I guess so.

44:51.022 --> 44:53.422
He's on
scholarship, too?

44:54.559 --> 44:55.856
No, why?

44:56.193 --> 44:59.329
We got George,
we got Harry,
we got trouble.

44:59.330 --> 45:02.232
They're rich, you're poor.
You wanna get rich.

45:02.233 --> 45:05.702
You wanna graduate Baird,
become a rich
big shot like them.

45:05.703 --> 45:07.203
Am I right?
No.

45:07.204 --> 45:09.002
It's not that
way at all.

45:09.607 --> 45:11.132
Okay, Charlie!

45:13.010 --> 45:15.502
Here we are, gentlemen,
the Oak Room.

45:16.013 --> 45:17.572
The Oak Room!

45:18.115 --> 45:21.184
Bring us a menu and
double Jack Daniels
on the rocks.

45:21.185 --> 45:23.186
Charlie, sit down here.

45:23.187 --> 45:25.952
Perhaps you'll feel more
comfortable in this, sir.

45:30.995 --> 45:34.329
You look great!

45:38.970 --> 45:40.597
Thank you.

45:41.739 --> 45:44.902
Here we are, Charlie,
the Oak Room.

45:45.676 --> 45:48.145
Now, read me
the bill of fare.

45:48.913 --> 45:50.437
Let's see.

45:50.881 --> 45:53.950
You got the Oak Room
burger and fries for $24.

45:53.951 --> 45:55.652
Where's the booze?

45:55.653 --> 45:57.287
Flowin' like
mud around here.

45:57.288 --> 45:58.756
A $24 hamburger?

46:00.291 --> 46:01.554
What's the story?

46:01.726 --> 46:03.193
What story?

46:04.595 --> 46:06.495
Are you a rich
miser or something?

46:06.931 --> 46:08.264
Hah!

46:08.265 --> 46:10.800
No, I'm just
your average blind man.

46:10.801 --> 46:12.531
Your average
blind man.

46:13.537 --> 46:16.268
How do you plan on paying
for all this stuff?

46:16.874 --> 46:18.774
Crisp, clean dollars.

46:19.143 --> 46:20.377
American.

46:20.378 --> 46:22.346
I saved up my
disability checks.

46:22.580 --> 46:25.749
How much did you save?
I mean, we flew first class,

46:25.750 --> 46:29.152
we're at the Waldorf-Astoria,
a $24 hamburger restaurant.

46:29.153 --> 46:31.087
All part of
a plan, Charlie.

46:31.522 --> 46:32.856
You want to let
me in on it?

46:32.857 --> 46:35.692
Why should I?
You're not interested.
You don't give a shit!

46:35.693 --> 46:40.130
You're leavin' on that
last shuttle
out of LaGuardia.

46:40.131 --> 46:41.894
Hmm? Ooh!

46:43.701 --> 46:46.534
You got 15 minutes, son.
I don't think
you're gonna make it.

46:47.304 --> 46:49.372
Unless the Oak Room
keeps some

46:49.373 --> 46:52.108
complimentary
helicopter on the roof.

46:52.109 --> 46:53.873
No, sir. No!

46:54.912 --> 46:56.846
You're here till tomorrow.

46:58.249 --> 47:00.650
You said the last shuttle
leaves at 2200 hours.

47:00.651 --> 47:02.585
That's 10:00, right?

47:03.387 --> 47:05.117
Last I heard, yeah.

47:05.823 --> 47:07.416
It's only ·:30.

47:07.858 --> 47:09.952
I lied. Leaves at 0:00.

47:10.661 --> 47:12.061
It leaves at 0:00?

47:12.229 --> 47:13.891
Calm down. Calm down.

47:15.833 --> 47:19.235
Ahh! The truth is,
Charlie,

47:21.205 --> 47:24.800
I need a guide dog
to help me execute my plan.

47:25.042 --> 47:26.567
What plan?

47:27.978 --> 47:29.674
You have a right to know.

47:31.348 --> 47:34.113
It's not really a plan,
Charlie. It's sort of a...

47:34.685 --> 47:36.654
More like a tour,

47:37.254 --> 47:39.689
a little tour
of pleasures.

47:40.358 --> 47:44.089
Stay in a first-class hotel,
eat an agreeable meal,

47:44.895 --> 47:47.125
drink a nice
glass of wine,

47:48.733 --> 47:50.433
see my big brother.

47:50.434 --> 47:53.203
Nothing like family,
you know.

47:53.204 --> 47:57.163
And then, make love
to a terrific woman.

47:59.477 --> 48:00.910
After that...

48:06.851 --> 48:08.114
Yeah?

48:10.554 --> 48:15.014
I'm gonna lie down on
my big, beautiful bed
at the Waldorf

48:15.259 --> 48:16.920
and blow my brains out.

48:20.831 --> 48:22.665
May I tell you
our specials?

48:22.666 --> 48:24.157
You may, sir.

48:24.735 --> 48:26.703
Tonight we have
charred venison with

48:26.704 --> 48:29.139
buckwheat spaetzle
and green peppercorn.

48:29.140 --> 48:32.876
Grilled veal paillards,
tomato tapenade,
and roasted eggplants.

48:32.877 --> 48:34.811
Get me a napkin.
My mouth's watering.

48:34.812 --> 48:37.113
If you would like our
cr·me souffl· for dessert,

48:37.114 --> 48:39.115
it would be a good
idea to order now.

48:39.116 --> 48:43.076
Yes, on the souffl·.
Give us a half a minute
on the rest.

48:43.454 --> 48:44.922
Very good, sir.

48:49.193 --> 48:51.127
I'm leaning
towards the spaetzle.

48:51.128 --> 48:54.531
Colonel Slade...
Charlie, rolls on the table?

48:54.532 --> 48:55.799
Give 'em to me.

48:55.800 --> 48:58.101
You should
try these rolls, Charlie.

48:58.102 --> 49:01.704
I used to dream about them
when I was at Fort Huachuca.

49:01.705 --> 49:04.474
Colonel Slade...
Bread's no good
west of the Colorado.

49:04.475 --> 49:06.342
Water's too alkaline.

49:06.343 --> 49:09.108
Colonel Slade,
did you say...

49:09.513 --> 49:11.311
Did I hear you right?

49:12.650 --> 49:14.482
You said you're gonna
kill yourself?

49:15.085 --> 49:16.453
No.

49:16.454 --> 49:18.422
I said I was gonna
blow my brains out.

49:19.890 --> 49:21.791
Try one of these
rolls, Charlie.

49:21.792 --> 49:23.761
I buttered it for you.

49:24.428 --> 49:25.995
I don't want a roll,
all right?

49:25.996 --> 49:27.760
Okay. Have a radish!

49:28.666 --> 49:29.963
Hah!

49:31.368 --> 49:35.538
Hello! Bring me
a double Jack Daniels
on the rocks.

49:35.539 --> 49:36.836
Yes, sir.
Right away.

49:40.978 --> 49:43.345
Please, don't do that.

49:44.548 --> 49:46.107
Don't do that.

49:52.756 --> 49:53.883
Hmm.

49:57.228 --> 49:59.025
What a marvelous place.

50:02.800 --> 50:04.131
Okay.

50:08.138 --> 50:10.073
Yeah.

50:11.375 --> 50:13.434
Your billet is here.

50:14.011 --> 50:17.003
You'll find bedding
in the closet on the shelf.

50:18.048 --> 50:20.250
In the morning,
the area will be

50:20.251 --> 50:22.151
returned to
sitting-room mode

50:22.152 --> 50:24.451
no later than
0700 hours.

50:28.559 --> 50:29.924
What was that?

50:32.596 --> 50:33.825
Nothing.

50:34.899 --> 50:37.891
Next time
snap it out!

50:40.170 --> 50:44.437
Thumb to palm, index finger
through little digit,
smartly aligned,

50:45.776 --> 50:48.370
sharp to the hairline,
down!

50:52.983 --> 50:55.418
Too many men,
far better than you,

50:55.419 --> 50:57.387
have executed
that courtesy.

50:58.055 --> 51:01.150
And if you're smart,
you won't try it again.

51:05.296 --> 51:09.665
This bat has
got sharper radar
than the Nautilus.

51:10.167 --> 51:12.636
Don't fuck with me,
Charlie.

51:23.747 --> 51:26.239
See you get
a good night's
sleep, son.

51:38.429 --> 51:41.130
It's a lovely day today

51:41.131 --> 51:44.067
So, whatever you gotta do

51:44.068 --> 51:47.299
You got a lovely day
to do it in, that's true

51:53.811 --> 51:55.802
Good morning, Charlie.

51:58.115 --> 51:59.844
Good morning.

52:00.184 --> 52:02.051
This is Sofia, Charlie.

52:02.052 --> 52:04.420
She's a magician
with a needle.

52:04.421 --> 52:07.523
Sofia's workin' me up
a little Glen Plaid number,

52:07.524 --> 52:10.187
and I've asked her if
she'd put something
together for you.

52:10.794 --> 52:13.096
I don't need
any clothes, Colonel.

52:13.097 --> 52:16.157
Standard issue
for an upscale
urban assignment.

52:16.467 --> 52:19.135
You don't like the clothes,
Charlie,
on completion of duty,

52:19.136 --> 52:21.161
you can give 'em away.

52:21.472 --> 52:24.907
Juice, coffee,
and other assorted goodies
on the trolley over there.

52:24.908 --> 52:27.138
Get yourself up,
get yourself together.

52:28.245 --> 52:31.414
It's a great day
for singin' a song

52:31.415 --> 52:34.851
And it's a great day
for movin' along

52:34.852 --> 52:37.520
And it's a great day
from morning to night

52:37.521 --> 52:39.512
And it's a great day

52:40.958 --> 52:42.687
For everybody's plight

52:49.199 --> 52:51.167
How are you feeling
today, Colonel?

52:51.168 --> 52:52.535
Super!

52:52.536 --> 52:54.170
Superior!

52:54.171 --> 52:55.764
Superfluous!

52:57.174 --> 52:59.506
Young Sofie here
is working Thanksgiving

52:59.910 --> 53:02.178
because she's trying to
put herself through college.

53:02.179 --> 53:05.314
I told her, "My young friend
Charlie's headed for college."

53:05.315 --> 53:06.916
Excuse me.

53:06.917 --> 53:08.217
Where you goin'?

53:08.218 --> 53:09.919
I need to use
the phone.

53:09.920 --> 53:12.150
What's wrong with
the phones in here?

53:12.689 --> 53:14.390
I don't want
to disturb you.

53:14.391 --> 53:16.951
You're not disturbing me.
Make your call.

53:17.594 --> 53:18.795
I'd kind of like
to be private.

53:18.796 --> 53:20.457
Stay out of my room!

53:21.699 --> 53:23.758
This is as private
as you're gonna get.

53:26.870 --> 53:30.898
But if
you've got somethin'
that must be done

53:31.708 --> 53:35.145
And it can only
be done by one

53:36.980 --> 53:38.209
Sofia,

53:39.783 --> 53:42.275
what are the chances
of suitin' you
up sometime?

53:43.954 --> 53:46.981
Sugarbush Lodge.
George Willis, please.

53:49.793 --> 53:50.993
Hello.

53:50.994 --> 53:52.587
George! Hey, it's Charlie.

53:53.130 --> 53:56.293
Hey, Chas.
Next year you gotta
come up with us.

53:56.734 --> 53:59.669
White powder on
a base of snow bunnies.

54:01.305 --> 54:03.398
Chas, are you there?

54:04.007 --> 54:05.842
Yeah, I'm here.

54:05.843 --> 54:08.277
You told me to call
you for the moves.

54:08.278 --> 54:09.612
All right.

54:09.613 --> 54:13.015
For now, the move's
no move, status quo.

54:13.016 --> 54:14.817
Everything's
the way we left it.

54:14.818 --> 54:16.286
How did we leave it?

54:17.121 --> 54:20.113
See no evil,
hear no eviI.

54:21.358 --> 54:23.326
You know
what I mean, Chas?

54:24.695 --> 54:27.562
Yeah. See no evil,
hear no evil.

54:29.900 --> 54:32.101
Okay, then,
walk like you talk.

54:32.102 --> 54:34.332
All right, bye.

54:35.272 --> 54:37.070
George Willis, huh?

54:38.075 --> 54:39.235
Yeah.

54:39.977 --> 54:41.544
George Willis.

54:41.545 --> 54:44.810
That makes his
father probably
George Willis, Senior.

54:45.883 --> 54:47.884
Charlie, I ask you,

54:47.885 --> 54:51.888
what do you think
big George is gonna feel
about little George

54:51.889 --> 54:54.949
seeing no evil,
hearing no evil?

54:57.494 --> 54:59.622
Well, we're not gonna
tell our parents.

54:59.830 --> 55:02.731
We're just gonna keep it
between ourselves.

55:03.400 --> 55:06.267
Oh, George isn't gonna tell
his father about this thing!

55:07.037 --> 55:08.271
Damn decent of him.

55:10.007 --> 55:12.141
Scusi, Colonnello.
Prego.

55:12.142 --> 55:13.906
I love it
when you hurt me.

55:15.479 --> 55:17.346
Tell me now,
Charlie.

55:17.347 --> 55:21.307
This George Willis, Jr.,
what's his father do?

55:22.286 --> 55:23.853
I don't really know.

55:23.854 --> 55:25.686
Well, I'm gonna tell you.

55:26.056 --> 55:27.924
When George Willis, Senior,

55:27.925 --> 55:30.726
isn't busy as
a million-dollar man
for Aetna Casualty...

55:30.727 --> 55:32.962
Or is it
New England distributor

55:32.963 --> 55:34.597
for the Chrysler
Corporation?

55:34.598 --> 55:38.592
He concerns himself
with his young son,
George Willis, Jr.

55:39.570 --> 55:42.038
George isn't going
to say anything
to his father.

55:42.039 --> 55:43.802
Oh, Charlie.

55:44.241 --> 55:46.576
Big George is gonna
wind up little George,

55:46.577 --> 55:49.679
and little George
is gonna sing
like a canary.

55:49.680 --> 55:52.171
And if you're hip, kid,
you're gonna hop to, too.

55:52.583 --> 55:54.784
You've got this
all figured out,
don't you?

55:54.785 --> 55:57.086
It don't take no
Young American merit

55:57.087 --> 55:58.988
scholarship to
figure this one out.

55:58.989 --> 56:01.090
Charlie,
you had a little life,

56:01.091 --> 56:03.192
so you decided
to go to the
Baird school

56:03.193 --> 56:05.560
to put yourself
in the market
for a big one.

56:05.963 --> 56:07.930
Now, in order to stay
in the running,

56:07.931 --> 56:10.992
you're gonna have
to tell these people
what they want to know.

56:12.302 --> 56:13.636
You think so?

56:13.637 --> 56:15.104
Are we finished, Sofia?

56:15.105 --> 56:16.766
Yes.
Grazie. Grazie.
Andate.

56:19.910 --> 56:21.434
Charlie,

56:22.613 --> 56:24.843
if you don't sing now,

56:25.515 --> 56:28.951
you're gonna end up,
not only shelving biscuits

56:28.952 --> 56:31.988
in some convenience store
in the Oregon 'burbs,

56:31.989 --> 56:34.924
but probably the last
word you'll ever hear
yourself say

56:34.925 --> 56:37.226
just before you croak,
gonna be,

56:37.227 --> 56:41.097
"Have a nice day
and come back soon."

56:41.098 --> 56:42.999
Sofia!

56:43.000 --> 56:44.867
Measure up
Charlie, here, pronto.

56:44.868 --> 56:46.802
We got a date
for Thanksgiving.

56:47.471 --> 56:48.734
We got a date?

56:49.006 --> 56:50.837
My brother's place.

56:50.974 --> 56:54.137
W.R. Slade,
White Plains, New York.

56:54.811 --> 56:57.212
Colonel, I can't go with you
to your brother's place.

56:57.347 --> 57:00.340
I mean, I should be
getting back to school.

57:03.253 --> 57:07.023
Well, you gotta have
Thanksgiving somewhere.

57:07.024 --> 57:09.191
I mean, eats and treats.

57:09.192 --> 57:11.024
I can use
the company, Charlie.

57:14.531 --> 57:15.998
All right.

57:15.999 --> 57:17.566
Does he know
I'm comin'?

57:17.567 --> 57:19.035
He doesn't know
I'm comin'.

57:19.036 --> 57:21.137
But wait till you see
the look on his face

57:21.138 --> 57:22.538
when I walk
through the door.

57:22.539 --> 57:24.098
Oh, he loves me!

57:26.376 --> 57:30.346
Oh, Charlie,
about your
little problem,

57:30.347 --> 57:33.015
there are two kinds
of people in this world:

57:33.016 --> 57:35.418
Those who stand up
and face the music,

57:35.419 --> 57:37.320
and those who
run for cover.

57:37.321 --> 57:38.955
Cover's better.

57:38.956 --> 57:41.157
Okay, Sofia, suit him up!

57:41.158 --> 57:42.785
Make him pretty.

57:59.242 --> 58:00.835
Careful.

58:02.145 --> 58:03.511
Should I ring it?
Yeah.

58:12.923 --> 58:15.187
Yes?
Yes!

58:15.359 --> 58:16.758
Who is this?

58:17.127 --> 58:18.617
It's Randy.

58:18.795 --> 58:20.627
Randy? You new?

58:21.698 --> 58:23.165
I'm your nephew.

58:23.166 --> 58:25.601
Hah! Here I am!

58:25.836 --> 58:27.737
Your sister's been
hoarding me
long enough.

58:27.738 --> 58:30.707
Thought it's time
to spread the
riches around.

58:31.141 --> 58:33.476
Uncle Frank.
Gloria!

58:33.477 --> 58:35.445
Gail.
Of course.

58:36.246 --> 58:39.148
Say hello to the potluck
party from New York City.

58:39.149 --> 58:42.618
Good old Uncle
Frank and this here
with him is Charlie Simms,

58:42.619 --> 58:45.521
star halfback of the
Baird football team.

58:45.522 --> 58:49.390
They not only beat
Exeter and Groton,
but Aquinas High School, too.

58:50.327 --> 58:52.161
Where's your
miserable father?

58:52.162 --> 58:54.497
Wait! No, no.
Let's surprise him.

58:54.498 --> 58:58.093
Give that fat
heart of his
an attack. Willie!

59:00.103 --> 59:01.571
Ho, Willie!

59:14.785 --> 59:16.275
Hello, Frank.

59:16.853 --> 59:19.155
How you doin'?
Okay.

59:19.156 --> 59:20.555
Here's my hand.

59:22.192 --> 59:24.422
Charlie, meet
W.R. Slade.

59:24.594 --> 59:25.961
Nice to meet you, sir.

59:25.962 --> 59:28.798
The original
bulging briefcase man.

59:28.799 --> 59:31.667
Gretchen, I smell
those prunes!

59:31.668 --> 59:33.803
We talkin'
turkey Marbella?
Yes, we are.

59:37.040 --> 59:38.707
Let's have a whiff.
Come on.

59:38.708 --> 59:40.676
You know, I always
had a sneaker for you.
Come here.

59:44.948 --> 59:47.349
Where are you, Garry?
I heard you cough.
Right here.

59:47.350 --> 59:48.943
Who are you again?

59:49.219 --> 59:54.023
I'm here at
the Waldorf with...
Is it your brother?

59:54.024 --> 59:56.592
W.R.'s final issue.
How ya doin', son?

59:56.593 --> 59:59.085
Yeah, sure,
Frank's my brother.
Who the hell are you?

59:59.830 --> 01:00:01.931
I'm takin' care of him
for the weekend.

01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:03.092
Charlie.

01:00:05.135 --> 01:00:06.125
Sorry.

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:08.329
Where's the booze?

01:00:08.772 --> 01:00:10.039
Flowin' like mud here.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:13.669
To tell the truth,
the Colonel's not well,
I don't think.

01:00:14.144 --> 01:00:15.373
Not well?

01:00:15.745 --> 01:00:17.737
I think he's
a little lonely.

01:00:18.315 --> 01:00:20.549
Why didn't you
take him to your
family's for dinner?

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:22.041
I heard that!

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:25.454
I heard that.

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:28.691
Pay no attention
to him, Charlie.
That's just big-brother talk.

01:00:28.692 --> 01:00:31.393
He's been watching out
for me since day one.

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:35.195
Bailed me out of more trouble
than he'd like to remember.

01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:38.265
Here, let me
take your coat.

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:42.605
I meant to pick up
some vino on my way up,
but I blew it.

01:00:42.606 --> 01:00:45.207
I'll send you the
Rothschild again
for Christmas,

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:47.676
only let's see how
Thanksgiving goes.

01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:49.178
I'll set two
more places.

01:00:49.179 --> 01:00:50.646
Here's
your drink, Frank.

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:52.515
Thank you, Randy.

01:00:52.516 --> 01:00:54.711
Still with
Snow Queen Sugar?

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:58.880
Snow Flake.
Why do you always
get that wrong?

01:00:59.256 --> 01:01:01.357
Because it's not
important for me
to get it right.

01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:02.985
What are you doing
there now?

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.560
I'm vice president
for marketing.

01:01:05.762 --> 01:01:07.730
Hoo-ah!
Congratulations!

01:01:08.632 --> 01:01:10.132
Sugar is shit, though.

01:01:10.133 --> 01:01:13.402
I told General Abrams,
install honey in
the commissaries.

01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:15.404
If K-50s didn't
blow your brains out,

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:17.206
sugar, sure as shit,
was gonna.

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:20.709
Why don't we
all sit down?
Ooh.

01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:24.580
Mitsouki. Rhymes
with nookie.
Be careful.

01:01:24.581 --> 01:01:27.416
When the wife
gets restless,
the wife gets racy.

01:01:27.417 --> 01:01:29.084
Well, let's
go and eat,
shall we?

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:30.519
By all means.

01:01:32.088 --> 01:01:33.822
Thank you, Charlie.

01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:37.993
Where you
wanna sit, Frank?
At the head again?

01:01:37.994 --> 01:01:41.760
Any old card table
will do. This is fine.

01:01:43.667 --> 01:01:45.134
Where was I?

01:01:45.135 --> 01:01:48.437
So, I wake up.
It's 4:00 in the morning.
I don't know who I'm with

01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:50.805
or why I'm there,
or where I am.

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:54.242
What am I gonna do?
I got this Asian flower

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:58.648
on one hand,
all giggly and dewy-like,

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:03.118
and this hard-boiled
Navy nurse outta Omaha,
on the other.

01:02:03.119 --> 01:02:06.885
We're three across
the bed, not a stitch
of clothes on.

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:08.756
It comes to me.

01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:14.161
Let east meet west.
We'll build a
golden bridge.

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:19.225
I felt like I'd just joined
the corps of engineers!

01:02:25.342 --> 01:02:27.003
We all still here?

01:02:27.944 --> 01:02:29.935
It's a
beautiful story.

01:02:32.349 --> 01:02:36.151
Do you always enjoy
shocking people,
Uncle Frank?

01:02:36.152 --> 01:02:37.319
Honey...

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.822
I didn't know
you were so
easily shocked, Randy.

01:02:39.823 --> 01:02:42.124
I admire your
sensibilities,
I'm touched.

01:02:42.125 --> 01:02:45.194
Dad, remember the time
you persuaded Frank

01:02:45.195 --> 01:02:47.363
to go to the kennel?

01:02:47.364 --> 01:02:48.497
What about it?

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:50.833
He almost put
the seeing eye dog business
outta business.

01:02:50.834 --> 01:02:52.101
Cool it, Randy.

01:02:52.102 --> 01:02:53.968
It's over and done with.

01:02:54.404 --> 01:02:56.338
Indeed it is, Garry.

01:02:56.339 --> 01:02:58.540
Indeed it is.
So is dinner.

01:02:58.541 --> 01:03:00.209
Charlie, what time
you have?

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:01.777
I think we better
be gettin' back.

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:04.947
You ever given
any thought to
a Braille watch, Frank?

01:03:04.948 --> 01:03:06.048
Randy...

01:03:06.049 --> 01:03:09.652
Stevie Wonder wears one,
or do you rank on him, too?

01:03:09.653 --> 01:03:10.853
Honey, please.

01:03:10.854 --> 01:03:13.255
It's all right, Gloria.
I enjoy Randy's
observations.

01:03:13.256 --> 01:03:15.384
My wife's name
is Gail, Frank.

01:03:15.825 --> 01:03:17.426
Can you hear that?
Gail.

01:03:17.427 --> 01:03:19.725
Excuse me.
Gail.

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:23.432
Gail strikes me as
a very beautiful woman,

01:03:23.433 --> 01:03:26.268
but, you know,
there's a little
tension in her voice.

01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:29.104
I don't know what it is.
It could be one
of two things,

01:03:29.105 --> 01:03:31.734
either Gail is nervous
or unsatisfied.

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:35.644
What's your point,
Uncle Frank?

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:37.179
You ought to
go down on her.

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:39.515
Cut it out, Frank,
will ya?

01:03:39.516 --> 01:03:41.550
You've gotten
so wrapped up
in sugar,

01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:43.752
you forgotten
the taste of
real honey!

01:03:43.753 --> 01:03:45.287
Frank, for
God's sake!

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:46.455
Hear that voice?

01:03:46.456 --> 01:03:48.090
There's fire
under that dress.

01:03:48.091 --> 01:03:50.292
Will you cut it out?
Just get the fuck
outta here.

01:03:50.293 --> 01:03:52.328
Hoo-ah!
Get in your limousine.

01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:56.465
Go down to the Bowery.
Get with the other fucking
drunks, where you belong!

01:03:56.466 --> 01:03:57.633
Wait a minute.

01:03:57.634 --> 01:03:59.501
What?
Can you take it easy?

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:00.669
What for?

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:04.163
You want me to lay off him,
Chucky, 'cause he's blind?

01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:05.774
No, but...

01:04:05.775 --> 01:04:07.843
My friend's name is Charles.

01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:09.845
He doesn't like to
be called Chucky.

01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:12.314
This is supposed to be
a family get-together.

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:13.716
Just a warning.

01:04:13.717 --> 01:04:17.586
Jesus Christ,
another sucker who thinks
this shit-heel's a war hero.

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:18.748
Hoo-ah!

01:04:21.224 --> 01:04:23.852
Well, once, maybe.

01:04:25.028 --> 01:04:28.364
I suppose he told
you about his days on
Lyndon Johnson's staff?

01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:30.629
I was gonna go.
Now I'm not leaving.

01:04:31.668 --> 01:04:33.898
Frank was earmarked
for general.

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:36.068
Earmarked, good word.

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:38.607
Frank likes to spit
in everybody's eye!

01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:39.942
Randy, that's enough.

01:04:39.943 --> 01:04:44.380
So they, what do they call it,
when they give you the
shaft in the military?

01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:45.748
Passed over!

01:04:45.749 --> 01:04:48.684
Right, Frank was
passed over
for promotion.

01:04:49.452 --> 01:04:50.886
Couple times.

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:56.258
You wanna know
what happened then?

01:04:56.259 --> 01:04:57.793
Will you shut
your mouth?

01:04:57.794 --> 01:04:59.228
He blew himself up.

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:00.729
Stop it, Randy.

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:03.966
Our Colonel here had
a grenade juggling act

01:05:03.967 --> 01:05:06.502
at Fort Bragg, or wherever
it was they dumped him.

01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:07.569
Fort Benning.

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:10.472
He was teaching
hand-to-hand combat
to second lieutenants...

01:05:10.473 --> 01:05:13.041
Randy, look at me when
you're talking to me,
now, son.

01:05:13.042 --> 01:05:17.379
I'm lookin', Frank.
His partner in the act
was some captain.

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:18.981
Major Vincent Squires.

01:05:18.982 --> 01:05:20.249
Whoever he was.

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:23.018
Before going on, they'd
have a lo-cal breakfast,

01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:25.888
a screwdriver for Frank,
bloody mary for his partner.

01:05:25.889 --> 01:05:27.723
No, Vincent drank
Sea Breezes.

01:05:27.724 --> 01:05:29.558
The Judge Advocate
at Benning said

01:05:29.559 --> 01:05:33.629
Colonel Slade had four
to his partner's one.

01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:36.632
He's really
flying in class.
He gets all excited.

01:05:36.633 --> 01:05:38.965
He starts pulling
the pins out.

01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:43.702
One grenade got
away from him.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.132
Boom.

01:05:47.977 --> 01:05:49.778
The one that got away.

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:52.407
The pin was in,
Frank claims.

01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:56.084
In or out, what
difference does it make?

01:05:56.085 --> 01:05:58.953
What kind of
fucking lunatic
juggles grenades?

01:05:59.656 --> 01:06:00.989
Vinnie came out okay.

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:03.220
All Frank lost
was his eyesight.

01:06:07.030 --> 01:06:08.797
You wanna know
the truth?

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:10.399
Got a handle
on that, do you?

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.867
He was
an asshole before.

01:06:11.868 --> 01:06:13.063
Hoo-ah!

01:06:14.838 --> 01:06:17.406
Now all he is,
is a blind asshole.

01:06:17.407 --> 01:06:18.636
Hoo-ah.

01:06:25.014 --> 01:06:27.574
Hey, God's a funny guy.

01:06:29.886 --> 01:06:32.014
God doth have
a sense of humor.

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:38.124
Maybe God thinks
some people don't
deserve to see.

01:06:39.329 --> 01:06:40.626
Hoo-ah.

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:47.500
You get
the point, Chucky?

01:06:52.475 --> 01:06:54.239
His name is Charles.

01:06:54.911 --> 01:06:57.079
You can say that,
can't you? Charles.

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.615
Know what this is, Randy?
It's a Ranger choke hold.

01:06:59.616 --> 01:07:02.050
From teaching
those lieutenants.
Colonel, let go.

01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:04.519
Little pressure,
I bust your windpipe.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.355
I don't care
what he said to me.
After me.

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:07.589
Charles.

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:09.358
Just let go, please!

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:30.535
Gretchen?

01:07:31.948 --> 01:07:33.848
You outdid yourself.

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:38.120
If you twist my
arm hard enough,

01:07:38.121 --> 01:07:40.647
we're talking
turkey Marbella
next year.

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:42.547
Who knows?

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:50.260
Frank?

01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:53.231
Goodbye, Willie.

01:07:57.874 --> 01:07:59.603
I'm no fucking good.

01:08:02.045 --> 01:08:03.945
And I never have been.

01:08:09.986 --> 01:08:12.318
Come on, Charlie,
get the coats.

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:21.095
Colonel.
Watch your step.

01:08:23.765 --> 01:08:25.098
Hold it.

01:08:39.082 --> 01:08:42.779
Nueva York,
compadre. Vamos!

01:09:27.697 --> 01:09:29.323
You got a watch?

01:09:33.136 --> 01:09:34.466
It's 7:20.

01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:38.734
I didn't ask you the time.
I asked if you had a watch.

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:41.243
Yeah, in the other room.

01:09:41.243 --> 01:09:42.438
Get it.

01:09:46.783 --> 01:09:49.809
Colonel, there's a clock
right next to your bed.

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.111
Does it have
a second hand?

01:09:59.429 --> 01:10:01.226
Yeah.
Time me!

01:10:29.025 --> 01:10:30.424
How long?

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:35.994
About 30 seconds.

01:10:36.299 --> 01:10:37.664
I'm rusty.

01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:40.569
Where did you get
a gun, Colonel?

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:43.198
Piece or weapon,
Charlie,
never gun.

01:10:46.109 --> 01:10:48.270
Where did you
get the piece?

01:10:48.744 --> 01:10:51.246
I'm an officer
in the US Army.

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:53.011
This is my sidearm.

01:10:54.183 --> 01:10:55.817
But you're not
an officer anymore.

01:10:55.818 --> 01:10:57.684
So I'm retired,
so what?

01:10:58.121 --> 01:11:00.919
An officer never
relinquishes his.45.

01:11:01.657 --> 01:11:05.393
You better relinquish
it to me or I'm gonna
have to call Mrs. Rossi.

01:11:05.394 --> 01:11:06.953
Good idea.

01:11:08.297 --> 01:11:10.198
Then I'm going
back to school.

01:11:10.199 --> 01:11:12.801
Even better.
Blue skies, green lights.

01:11:12.802 --> 01:11:14.603
I hope you have
a wonderful trip.

01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:17.839
That felt like 25.
Gotta be able to
do a.45 in 25.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.040
Did you time me?

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:21.169
I did not and
I'm calling Albany.

01:11:30.987 --> 01:11:32.420
That was stupid.

01:11:33.923 --> 01:11:35.186
Was it?

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:38.791
You're stuck with me,
Charlie.

01:11:39.795 --> 01:11:41.930
No, I'm not.
I'm outta here!

01:11:41.931 --> 01:11:43.598
Where you going,
New Hampshire?

01:11:43.599 --> 01:11:46.262
You got no money.
How you gonna do that?

01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:52.672
Karen's number
tastes like Albany.

01:11:55.878 --> 01:11:57.512
Fine.
I'm leaving.

01:11:57.513 --> 01:11:59.914
Charlie. Charlie!

01:12:12.595 --> 01:12:16.224
All I want from you
is another day.

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:19.165
For what?

01:12:21.737 --> 01:12:24.707
One last tour
of the battlefield.

01:12:28.444 --> 01:12:31.072
I can get around
a city like New York,

01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:33.882
but I

01:12:33.883 --> 01:12:36.875
sometimes need a point
in the right direction.

01:12:40.056 --> 01:12:41.923
What do you say,
Charles?

01:12:41.924 --> 01:12:44.894
What's one day
between friends?

01:12:49.065 --> 01:12:51.761
All right. Say I stay
for another day.

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:54.869
Will you give me
your weapon?

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:56.171
Oh, Charlie,

01:12:56.172 --> 01:12:58.573
I'm a lieutenant colonel,
United States Army.

01:12:58.574 --> 01:13:01.176
I'm not giving
my fucking gun
to anyone.

01:13:01.177 --> 01:13:03.645
Now, what are
you drinkin'?

01:13:03.646 --> 01:13:06.081
Colonel, this
is unacceptable.

01:13:06.082 --> 01:13:09.184
Unacceptable?
What are you givin' me
that prep school crap for?

01:13:09.185 --> 01:13:10.652
Unacceptable?

01:13:10.653 --> 01:13:14.356
What have they done,
taken the Oregon
out of the boy?

01:13:14.357 --> 01:13:16.723
Put in Harvard
Business School?

01:13:17.693 --> 01:13:19.286
Then give me
your bullets.

01:13:25.501 --> 01:13:28.698
You do see the sense of it,
Charlie, don't you?

01:13:31.674 --> 01:13:34.006
I can't chew
the leather anymore.

01:13:35.011 --> 01:13:39.414
So, why should I share
the tribe's provisions?

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:43.950
I mean, there's no one

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:47.351
wants to tear a herring
with me anymore.

01:13:50.059 --> 01:13:51.618
The bullets, Colonel.

01:13:51.794 --> 01:13:53.228
"The bullets, Colonel."

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:56.660
You sound like a guy in
Lives of a Bengal Lancer.

01:14:15.885 --> 01:14:18.047
What do you
give a shit for?

01:14:19.388 --> 01:14:20.955
About what?

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:22.322
About what?

01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:25.657
About whether
I blow my brains
out or not.

01:14:31.834 --> 01:14:33.668
Because I have
a conscience.

01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:35.364
You have
a conscience.

01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:37.971
I forgot.

01:14:39.375 --> 01:14:41.343
The Charlie Conscience.

01:14:43.346 --> 01:14:45.815
Do we tell?
Do we not tell?

01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:50.248
Do we follow
the rich boy's code
or not?

01:14:51.253 --> 01:14:53.381
Do we let this
blind asshole

01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:56.417
die or not?

01:14:56.959 --> 01:14:58.256
Yeah.

01:14:58.728 --> 01:15:00.491
Conscience, Charlie.

01:15:01.731 --> 01:15:03.358
When were
you born, son?

01:15:03.699 --> 01:15:05.800
Around the time
of the Round Table?

01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:08.997
Haven't you heard?

01:15:09.472 --> 01:15:12.305
Conscience is dead.

01:15:13.409 --> 01:15:15.010
No, I haven't heard.

01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:18.708
Then take the fucking wax
outta your ears!

01:15:21.784 --> 01:15:23.047
Grow up!

01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:35.959
It's fuck your buddy.

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.093
Cheat on your wife.

01:15:42.471 --> 01:15:44.940
Call your mother
on Mother's Day.

01:15:47.143 --> 01:15:48.406
Charlie,

01:15:49.578 --> 01:15:51.478
it's all shit.

01:16:03.025 --> 01:16:04.584
Where you goin'?

01:16:05.494 --> 01:16:07.190
I got piss call.

01:16:08.864 --> 01:16:11.966
I know I said I need ya
forjust one day

01:16:11.967 --> 01:16:14.459
but even I can't
hold it that long.

01:16:16.972 --> 01:16:18.406
Oh, and Charlie,

01:16:20.009 --> 01:16:22.500
you forgot the one
in the chamber.

01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:32.054
There you go, sir.

01:16:32.788 --> 01:16:34.051
Thank you.

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:39.391
Twenty-six years
in the service,

01:16:40.062 --> 01:16:42.326
never let an aide
shine my shoes.

01:16:43.032 --> 01:16:45.797
Where you gonna be
in 26 years, Charlie?

01:16:46.402 --> 01:16:50.168
Playing golf with
your friends from
the Baird School, I bet.

01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:55.610
I don't even
like those guys.

01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:58.444
Of course you don't.
They're all assholes.

01:16:59.648 --> 01:17:02.379
Be a pleasure to
squeal on 'em,
wouldn't it?

01:17:03.118 --> 01:17:04.886
Yeah, well,
I'm not a squealer.

01:17:04.887 --> 01:17:06.421
"I'm not a squealer."

01:17:06.422 --> 01:17:08.618
What is this,
the Dreyfus case?

01:17:12.828 --> 01:17:14.956
Ooh. Ooh, mama!

01:17:15.898 --> 01:17:17.198
There you go.

01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:18.700
Thank you.

01:17:18.701 --> 01:17:20.396
Thank you.

01:17:21.203 --> 01:17:22.762
Watch your step.

01:17:25.274 --> 01:17:28.335
I'm gettin' that heavy
feelin' again, Charlie.

01:17:31.747 --> 01:17:33.909
There's more to this,
isn't there?

01:17:35.217 --> 01:17:36.708
Isn't there?

01:17:40.022 --> 01:17:41.922
I was offered
a bribe.

01:17:42.424 --> 01:17:44.120
Now we're cookin'.

01:17:45.427 --> 01:17:47.760
Mr. Trask,
the headmaster,

01:17:50.165 --> 01:17:52.066
he promised to get
me into Harvard.

01:17:52.067 --> 01:17:53.592
If you squeal.

01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:55.370
Yeah.

01:17:55.371 --> 01:17:57.272
What a dilemma.

01:17:57.273 --> 01:18:01.107
Should Charlie Simms
accept a free ride
into Harvard, or not?

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:07.282
What do you think your
friend George would do
if he were in your shoes?

01:18:07.283 --> 01:18:08.750
He is,
practically.

01:18:08.751 --> 01:18:10.218
How?

01:18:10.219 --> 01:18:14.556
It's just that Mr. Trask
hasn't promised to get
him into Harvard.

01:18:14.557 --> 01:18:16.391
Mr. Trask
doesn't have to.

01:18:16.392 --> 01:18:18.792
George's father's
gonna take care
of that.

01:18:20.796 --> 01:18:23.060
Do the deal,
Charlie. Take it!

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:25.133
Go to Harvard.

01:18:26.101 --> 01:18:27.435
I can't do that.

01:18:27.436 --> 01:18:28.631
Why not?

01:18:30.973 --> 01:18:33.772
There are just
some things
you can't do.

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:36.273
Explain 'em to me.

01:18:37.947 --> 01:18:39.280
Louder, please.

01:18:39.281 --> 01:18:40.647
I can't...

01:18:42.818 --> 01:18:46.220
You're gonna
have a tough time
in this world, Charlie.

01:18:47.323 --> 01:18:50.816
To ease the blow,
let me buy you
a drink. Come on.

01:18:52.361 --> 01:18:54.762
Double
Jack Daniels on the rocks.

01:18:54.763 --> 01:18:57.995
And bring my
young friend here
a Shirley Temple.

01:18:58.634 --> 01:19:00.796
Hold on.
Do you have beer?

01:19:01.103 --> 01:19:03.605
Certainly. May I
see some ID?

01:19:03.606 --> 01:19:06.908
Are you interested
in walkin' the rest
of your life, chappy?

01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:08.142
I'm sorry, sir, but...

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:11.238
I'm a regular here.
My boy's going on 23.

01:19:11.614 --> 01:19:14.449
Why don't you
call up front,
the office?

01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:17.249
Mr. Gilbert,
he's a friend of mine.

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:21.389
Any particular beer?

01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:24.155
Schlitz. No Schlitz?

01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:27.026
Blatz. No Blatz?

01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:29.393
Lmprovise.

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:32.066
I'll do my best, sir.

01:19:32.067 --> 01:19:33.034
Thank you, sir.

01:19:33.035 --> 01:19:33.934
Thank you, sir.

01:19:34.737 --> 01:19:37.399
You're human, Charlie.
Beer?

01:19:40.909 --> 01:19:42.901
Who are we
drinking with?

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:46.640
I'm getting
a nice soap-and-water
feeling from down there.

01:19:54.757 --> 01:19:56.554
A female.

01:19:56.825 --> 01:19:58.384
"Female"?

01:19:58.994 --> 01:20:02.658
You callin' her female
must mean you like her
or you wouldn't be so casual.

01:20:06.268 --> 01:20:07.635
Is she alone?

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:09.001
Yeah, she's alone.

01:20:11.106 --> 01:20:12.767
Things are heatin' up.

01:20:13.342 --> 01:20:14.935
Chestnut hair?

01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:17.736
Brown, light brown.

01:20:19.915 --> 01:20:21.315
Twenty-two?

01:20:23.752 --> 01:20:26.051
What am I,
a guy at a carnival?

01:20:26.588 --> 01:20:29.490
The day we stop lookin',
Charlie, is the day we die.

01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:31.619
Move.

01:20:31.894 --> 01:20:33.928
Where?
You know where, son.

01:20:33.929 --> 01:20:35.761
Don't be coy, Charlie.

01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:40.699
This woman is
made for you.
I can feel it.

01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:43.466
Goddamn beautiful,
isn't she?

01:20:43.706 --> 01:20:46.607
She's not bad.
Bingo! The boy's alive.

01:20:47.810 --> 01:20:50.609
Come on, son,
perambulate.

01:20:51.613 --> 01:20:53.138
Perambulate.

01:21:02.725 --> 01:21:06.161
Excuse me, se·orita,
do you mind if
we join you?

01:21:08.130 --> 01:21:10.656
I'm feelin' you're
being neglected.

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.634
I'm expecting somebody.

01:21:15.671 --> 01:21:17.036
Instantly?

01:21:18.407 --> 01:21:20.308
No, but any minute now.

01:21:20.309 --> 01:21:21.609
Any minute?

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:24.409
Some people live
a lifetime
in a minute.

01:21:25.581 --> 01:21:27.674
What are you doin'
right now?

01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:30.043
I'm waiting for him.

01:21:30.652 --> 01:21:33.247
Would you mind if
we waited with you,

01:21:34.523 --> 01:21:37.515
just to keep
the womanizers
from bothering you?

01:21:41.296 --> 01:21:42.958
No, I don't mind.

01:21:43.332 --> 01:21:44.799
Thank you.

01:21:48.303 --> 01:21:49.498
Charlie.

01:21:53.142 --> 01:21:56.477
You know, I detect
a fragrance
in the air.

01:21:56.478 --> 01:21:58.503
Don't tell me
what it is.

01:21:59.481 --> 01:22:01.381
Ogilvie Sisters
soap.

01:22:03.318 --> 01:22:04.819
That's amazing.

01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:07.021
I'm in the
amazing business.

01:22:07.022 --> 01:22:09.013
It is
Ogilvie Sisters
soap.

01:22:09.691 --> 01:22:11.959
My grandmother gave me
three bars for Christmas.

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:14.195
I'm crazy about
your grandmother.

01:22:14.196 --> 01:22:16.756
I think she'd have
liked Charlie, too.

01:22:17.332 --> 01:22:19.066
Don't pay any
attention to him.

01:22:19.067 --> 01:22:20.568
What's your name?

01:22:20.569 --> 01:22:21.869
Donna.

01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:25.006
Donna? I'm Frank.
This here is...

01:22:25.007 --> 01:22:26.340
Charlie.

01:22:26.341 --> 01:22:28.173
Yes.
She likes you.

01:22:29.278 --> 01:22:31.279
Charlie's having
a difficult weekend.

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:32.814
He's going
through a crisis.

01:22:32.815 --> 01:22:35.683
How does he look like
he's holding up?

01:22:35.684 --> 01:22:37.618
He looks fine to me.

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:39.610
She does like you,
Charlie.

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:46.959
So, Donna,

01:22:49.898 --> 01:22:51.389
do you tango?

01:22:52.034 --> 01:22:54.662
No. I wanted to
learn once, but...

01:22:55.237 --> 01:22:56.329
But?

01:22:58.006 --> 01:22:59.841
But Michael
didn't want to.

01:22:59.842 --> 01:23:01.676
Michael.

01:23:01.677 --> 01:23:03.873
The one you're
waiting for.

01:23:04.546 --> 01:23:07.209
Michael thinks
the tango's hysterical.

01:23:07.616 --> 01:23:09.675
I think Michael's
hysterical.

01:23:10.486 --> 01:23:12.353
Don't pay any
attention to him.

01:23:12.354 --> 01:23:13.947
Did I already
say that?

01:23:16.491 --> 01:23:18.289
What a beautiful laugh.

01:23:20.028 --> 01:23:21.655
Thank you, Frank.

01:23:27.369 --> 01:23:30.066
Would you like
to learn to tango,
Donna?

01:23:32.875 --> 01:23:34.240
Right now?

01:23:35.644 --> 01:23:39.313
I'm offering you
my services,
free of charge.

01:23:39.314 --> 01:23:40.839
What do you say?

01:23:44.319 --> 01:23:46.310
I think I'd be
a little afraid.

01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:48.952
Of what?

01:23:49.825 --> 01:23:51.987
Afraid of making
a mistake.

01:23:53.529 --> 01:23:57.298
No mistakes
in the tango, Donna.
Not like life.

01:23:57.299 --> 01:24:00.167
It's simple.
That's what makes
the tango so great.

01:24:00.168 --> 01:24:03.627
If you make a mistake,
get all tangled up,
just tango on.

01:24:06.842 --> 01:24:08.571
Why don't you try?

01:24:12.948 --> 01:24:14.541
Will you try it?

01:24:16.518 --> 01:24:18.646
All right.
I'll give it a try.

01:24:19.988 --> 01:24:21.615
Hold me down, son.

01:24:28.196 --> 01:24:29.528
Your arm?

01:24:32.534 --> 01:24:33.797
Charlie,

01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:37.805
I'm gonna need some
coordinates here, son.

01:24:37.806 --> 01:24:40.808
The floor's about
20 by 30,

01:24:40.809 --> 01:24:42.971
and you're at
the long end.

01:24:43.879 --> 01:24:46.080
There's some tables
on the outside and

01:24:46.081 --> 01:24:48.015
the band's
on the right.

01:27:28.176 --> 01:27:31.942
Frank, you are
one incredible
dancer.

01:27:34.783 --> 01:27:37.081
Wait'll you see
Charlie dance.

01:27:37.686 --> 01:27:39.720
He's a liar.
I don't dance.

01:27:39.721 --> 01:27:41.255
Isn't he a charmer,
though?

01:27:41.256 --> 01:27:43.457
Truth is,
not only can he dance,

01:27:43.458 --> 01:27:45.326
but he'll sing you
a hell of a tune.

01:27:45.327 --> 01:27:48.095
He can do bird calls
and imitate Bela Lugosi.

01:27:48.096 --> 01:27:49.230
Hi, honey.

01:27:49.231 --> 01:27:50.289
Hi.
Hey.

01:27:50.866 --> 01:27:53.634
Michael, this is Frank
and this is Charlie.

01:27:53.635 --> 01:27:55.870
Hi, Frank, Charlie.
Sorry I'm late.

01:27:55.871 --> 01:27:57.270
That's okay.

01:27:57.706 --> 01:28:00.307
These two gentlemen
entertained me,

01:28:00.308 --> 01:28:01.901
and time flew.

01:28:02.077 --> 01:28:04.842
Your girl is a hell
of a tango dancer.

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:08.382
At last,
you found someone
to tango with.

01:28:08.383 --> 01:28:09.817
That's terrific!

01:28:09.818 --> 01:28:11.452
Let me shake your hand.

01:28:11.453 --> 01:28:13.287
No, it was Frank.

01:28:13.288 --> 01:28:15.416
Hell, I'll shake
both your hands!

01:28:16.591 --> 01:28:19.627
This looks like
the place, but
we gotta go.

01:28:19.628 --> 01:28:23.430
We got a date with
Darryl and Carol
in the Village.

01:28:23.431 --> 01:28:25.933
Do you have a check?
Michael, please.

01:28:25.934 --> 01:28:27.601
My pleasure.

01:28:27.602 --> 01:28:28.903
No, no. I got this.

01:28:28.904 --> 01:28:30.838
Michael, get your hand
outta your pocket.

01:28:30.839 --> 01:28:32.534
I'll take it. Really.

01:28:33.175 --> 01:28:34.574
Allow me.

01:28:36.978 --> 01:28:38.512
Why, thank you.

01:28:38.513 --> 01:28:40.004
Bye, guys.

01:28:40.515 --> 01:28:41.539
Bye.

01:28:49.791 --> 01:28:52.761
Darryl and Carol.
Yeah.

01:29:01.536 --> 01:29:03.404
It's apartment 17E,
Colonel.

01:29:03.405 --> 01:29:05.039
She's expecting you.

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:08.976
Don't worry about a thing.
She's the cr·me de la cr·me.

01:29:08.977 --> 01:29:11.545
My buddy took
the Vice Chancellor
of Germany to her.

01:29:11.546 --> 01:29:13.845
Now he wants to
immigrate to this country.

01:29:14.082 --> 01:29:16.210
You did good, hombre.

01:29:18.453 --> 01:29:20.251
My hair, how is it?

01:29:21.389 --> 01:29:22.823
It's perfect.

01:29:26.228 --> 01:29:28.196
I got the red
foulard okay,
didn't I?

01:29:28.763 --> 01:29:30.464
Yeah,
real dark red.

01:29:30.465 --> 01:29:33.492
Burgundy, Charlie.
Burgundy. They love it.

01:29:35.937 --> 01:29:37.166
Bay rum.

01:29:39.441 --> 01:29:40.908
Windsor knot.

01:29:43.778 --> 01:29:45.906
That's my heart
I'm feelin'.

01:29:55.857 --> 01:29:57.052
I'm off.

01:30:15.477 --> 01:30:16.977
Can you get long
distance on this?

01:30:16.978 --> 01:30:18.878
And how. Be my guest.

01:30:29.924 --> 01:30:31.358
Sugarbush Lodge.

01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:32.927
Hi. George Willis, please?

01:30:32.928 --> 01:30:34.725
One moment, please.

01:30:36.398 --> 01:30:38.465
Hello?
Harry?

01:30:38.466 --> 01:30:40.701
Chas, how are you?

01:30:40.702 --> 01:30:43.971
You just caught us.
We're about to shoot
George over to the airport.

01:30:43.972 --> 01:30:46.373
Why is George going
to the airport?

01:30:46.875 --> 01:30:50.072
Hold on. Maybe
you should talk
to the man himself.

01:30:51.346 --> 01:30:52.479
Chas.

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:53.614
Yeah. Hi, George.

01:30:53.615 --> 01:30:54.982
You just caught me.

01:30:54.983 --> 01:30:57.685
That's what Harry said.
Where you goin'?

01:30:57.686 --> 01:30:58.986
Home.

01:30:58.987 --> 01:31:00.254
To Boston?

01:31:00.255 --> 01:31:03.123
Catching the puddle·umper.
Keep your fingers crossed.

01:31:03.124 --> 01:31:05.354
What are you
going home for?

01:31:08.263 --> 01:31:12.222
I was thinking.
This asshole, Trask?
He's making no sense at all.

01:31:13.535 --> 01:31:17.237
Somebody's gotta talk to him.
My father was class of '59.

01:31:17.238 --> 01:31:21.107
Your father?
I thought we were gonna
keep our parents outta this.

01:31:21.409 --> 01:31:24.140
This guy Trask
is out of control, Chas.

01:31:24.746 --> 01:31:27.815
Out of control!
Somebody's gotta
talk to him.

01:31:27.816 --> 01:31:29.841
My father's
a major fundraiser,
you know.

01:31:30.719 --> 01:31:31.885
No, I didn't.

01:31:31.886 --> 01:31:33.053
Right.

01:31:33.054 --> 01:31:35.421
Relax. He'll get us
off the hook.

01:31:35.623 --> 01:31:37.424
I gotta go.
Everything all right?

01:31:37.425 --> 01:31:38.586
Sure.

01:31:38.793 --> 01:31:40.853
I'll see you Monday.
Goodbye.

01:31:41.162 --> 01:31:42.255
Bye.

01:32:06.988 --> 01:32:09.013
Good night, sir.
Good night.

01:32:21.403 --> 01:32:22.392
Hiya, Charlie.

01:32:24.739 --> 01:32:26.230
Watch the door.

01:32:44.859 --> 01:32:46.987
What a beautiful woman.

01:33:01.009 --> 01:33:02.910
Hello, there.

01:33:02.911 --> 01:33:04.845
Do you
see what I see?

01:33:04.846 --> 01:33:07.681
Yeah.
Either there's
something wrong,

01:33:07.682 --> 01:33:10.084
or we got the world's
worst hangover.

01:33:10.085 --> 01:33:12.186
Won't you come in?

01:33:12.187 --> 01:33:15.054
We hear
you got a picture of
the bank robbery.

01:33:32.607 --> 01:33:33.904
Colonel?

01:33:48.289 --> 01:33:50.189
Colonel,
you all right?

01:33:51.926 --> 01:33:53.360
What is it?

01:33:57.232 --> 01:33:58.999
It's after noon.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.298
You've been sleeping
all morning.

01:34:02.370 --> 01:34:03.770
So what?

01:34:06.274 --> 01:34:08.106
I don't know.
I thought...

01:34:13.014 --> 01:34:15.005
I talked to George
last night.

01:34:17.352 --> 01:34:21.345
His father's a big-deal
alumnus at school.
He's got a lot of pull.

01:34:22.991 --> 01:34:24.322
Really?

01:34:26.794 --> 01:34:30.253
Yeah, he's gonna talk
to the headmaster.

01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:35.302
George thinks he might
be able to get us
off the hook.

01:34:35.303 --> 01:34:37.203
"Get us off the hook."

01:34:37.972 --> 01:34:39.963
Yeah, that's what he said.

01:34:41.743 --> 01:34:43.643
Watch the "us" part.

01:34:46.781 --> 01:34:50.012
Colonel, don't you wanna
get up and do something?

01:34:54.155 --> 01:34:55.384
Colonel?

01:34:56.324 --> 01:34:58.349
Charlie, what do
you want?

01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:01.461
I don't know,

01:35:01.462 --> 01:35:03.624
but you're making
me nervous.

01:35:06.501 --> 01:35:08.731
My wallet is
on the dresser.

01:35:10.405 --> 01:35:12.464
Take out your plane ticket

01:35:13.341 --> 01:35:17.573
and $400
mustering-out pay, plus

01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:22.480
airport-to-school taxi.

01:35:25.453 --> 01:35:28.115
Colonel, it's no rush.
I mean, I can...

01:35:29.190 --> 01:35:30.757
I could stay for a while.

01:35:30.758 --> 01:35:33.057
Charlie, you already
gave me a day.

01:35:34.596 --> 01:35:37.622
And for that day,
I am eternally grateful.

01:35:40.301 --> 01:35:44.204
But right now
I have other plans.

01:35:45.807 --> 01:35:48.071
What other plans
do you have?

01:35:50.245 --> 01:35:51.735
To die, son.

01:35:53.615 --> 01:35:55.344
Colonel, you're...

01:35:55.984 --> 01:35:59.010
Come on, Colonel,
you're not gonna die today.

01:35:59.554 --> 01:36:01.784
Charlie,
give me your hand.

01:36:06.461 --> 01:36:08.327
You go now, boy.
Okay?

01:36:10.932 --> 01:36:12.764
You go. Just...

01:36:16.537 --> 01:36:18.631
Just leave me
sleep here.

01:36:20.141 --> 01:36:23.076
Look...
Can we start
over, please?

01:36:24.379 --> 01:36:26.745
What do you feel
like doin' today, huh?

01:36:27.515 --> 01:36:30.017
Look at this.
The sun is shining!

01:36:30.018 --> 01:36:32.179
It's a beautiful day.
Let's...

01:36:36.391 --> 01:36:39.559
Colonel, I know you don't
want to be a party poop,

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:41.428
so let's go out
and do something.

01:36:41.429 --> 01:36:43.193
Let's go for a ride.

01:36:48.703 --> 01:36:50.193
Yeah, a ride.

01:36:52.607 --> 01:36:54.404
A ride?

01:36:55.710 --> 01:36:58.045
Yeah, Colonel Slade,
what do you say?

01:36:58.046 --> 01:36:59.877
Let's go
for a ride, huh?

01:37:07.822 --> 01:37:09.517
What kind of ride?

01:37:11.659 --> 01:37:14.561
Yeah, this is a valid
Oregon driver's license,

01:37:14.562 --> 01:37:18.365
and we let appropriate
customers test-drive
the Testarossa.

01:37:18.366 --> 01:37:22.336
But you're 17, with
a blind companion.
That we don't do.

01:37:22.337 --> 01:37:24.604
This is a $100,000
piece of machinery.

01:37:24.605 --> 01:37:27.074
I'm not letting it
out this door.

01:37:27.075 --> 01:37:28.642
How about this one
over here?

01:37:28.643 --> 01:37:31.278
That's a Cabriolet T.
The same deal.

01:37:31.279 --> 01:37:35.716
You think I'll let
an unaccompanied kid
get in a $110,000 car?

01:37:35.717 --> 01:37:37.947
He will not be
unaccompanied.

01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:41.448
I'll be with him.
I'm his father.

01:37:42.223 --> 01:37:43.824
You're his father?

01:37:43.825 --> 01:37:45.019
Yes.

01:37:45.460 --> 01:37:48.528
I have an idea. Why don't
I take your father
for a test drive?

01:37:48.529 --> 01:37:50.497
What's your quota, Freddie?

01:37:50.498 --> 01:37:52.499
Don't worry
about my quota.
I do well.

01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:54.534
How many Ferraris
you sold this month?

01:37:54.535 --> 01:37:57.170
That's not relevant
to this discussion.

01:37:57.171 --> 01:37:58.901
Freddie,
the '·0s are over.

01:37:59.373 --> 01:38:02.209
Are you tryin' to tell me
these things are walkin'
outta the store?

01:38:02.210 --> 01:38:06.413
This is a Ferrari, sir,
the finest machinery made
in the automobile industry.

01:38:06.414 --> 01:38:09.750
If you like it that much,
why don't you sleep with it?
Why are you sellin' it?

01:38:09.751 --> 01:38:11.251
I'd love to
accommodate you...

01:38:11.252 --> 01:38:14.354
If this car performs
the way I expect it to,

01:38:14.355 --> 01:38:18.058
you will get
a check of $101,000,
and change,

01:38:18.059 --> 01:38:20.160
when you come in
here tomorrow morning.

01:38:20.161 --> 01:38:24.164
It's $100,000,
plus $050,
plus tax.

01:38:24.165 --> 01:38:26.967
Freddie, for you

01:38:26.968 --> 01:38:29.736
107 all in,

01:38:29.737 --> 01:38:33.298
plus a case of champagne
to go with your
leftover turkey.

01:38:34.575 --> 01:38:37.377
What do you say?
Don't worry about
the boy.

01:38:37.378 --> 01:38:41.114
He drives so smooth,
you can boil an egg
on the engine.

01:38:41.115 --> 01:38:44.312
When we bring
the car back, I'll peel
the egg for ya.

01:38:45.353 --> 01:38:48.948
Listen, you made me laugh,
but I can't let
the car go out.

01:38:50.925 --> 01:38:52.726
Want a deposit?

01:38:52.727 --> 01:38:55.162
This is not an
installment item, sir.

01:38:58.533 --> 01:39:02.128
Freddie, you're
no spring chicken.

01:39:04.305 --> 01:39:08.508
You know what they call me
at the home office?
"The Grey Ghost."

01:39:08.509 --> 01:39:10.911
You know why they
still keep me around?

01:39:10.912 --> 01:39:14.381
There's no kid here
that can move a Ferrari
like I can.

01:39:14.382 --> 01:39:17.083
I'm known from
coast to coast
like butter and toast.

01:39:17.084 --> 01:39:19.553
Ask anybody about
Freddie Bisco.

01:39:19.554 --> 01:39:21.054
When I get a Ferrari...

01:39:21.055 --> 01:39:22.689
Out the door!

01:39:24.125 --> 01:39:25.859
You just made
me laugh, Freddie.

01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:27.055
Yeah?

01:39:27.795 --> 01:39:29.058
2,000.

01:39:30.364 --> 01:39:33.266
Unless you take it,
you're gonna make me cry.

01:39:36.537 --> 01:39:38.403
I'm a grey ghost, too.

01:39:49.817 --> 01:39:52.878
See? This is fun,
isn't it?

01:40:07.468 --> 01:40:10.870
Drop her into neutral.
Slide her into second.

01:40:11.405 --> 01:40:12.839
Pop the clutch.

01:40:50.478 --> 01:40:53.280
Straight.
Hold it right
like that.

01:40:53.281 --> 01:40:55.515
Feel it?
That's straight.

01:40:55.516 --> 01:40:57.746
It's a straight street,
so keep it straight.

01:41:00.554 --> 01:41:02.022
Keep it straight.

01:41:02.023 --> 01:41:03.690
No fun just
to keep it straight.

01:41:03.691 --> 01:41:06.626
You've got to move
a little bit,
feel the road.

01:41:07.028 --> 01:41:10.020
Please? Just like this.
All right? There you go.

01:41:10.565 --> 01:41:12.465
Take it nice and easy.

01:41:13.301 --> 01:41:15.001
Do you like this?

01:41:18.639 --> 01:41:21.700
Slow it down
a little, Colonel.
You're goin' a little fast.

01:41:22.677 --> 01:41:24.941
Colonel, slow it down.

01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:27.805
Something's happened
to my foot!

01:41:29.584 --> 01:41:30.817
Slow it down, please.

01:41:30.818 --> 01:41:33.480
Hold on. I think
I've got another gear.

01:41:34.388 --> 01:41:35.913
Colonel Slade?

01:41:37.458 --> 01:41:38.653
Hoo-ah!

01:41:39.694 --> 01:41:40.922
Watch out!

01:41:44.865 --> 01:41:46.166
You'll get us killed!

01:41:46.167 --> 01:41:48.533
Don't blame me,
Charlie, I can't see!

01:41:51.172 --> 01:41:52.572
Colonel,
slow it down!

01:42:03.150 --> 01:42:04.379
Oh, Jesus!

01:42:04.885 --> 01:42:07.687
Now let's see how
this baby corners.

01:42:07.688 --> 01:42:08.755
Corners?

01:42:08.756 --> 01:42:10.224
Yeah. Say when.

01:42:10.858 --> 01:42:12.125
Say when what?

01:42:12.126 --> 01:42:13.426
Say when to turn.

01:42:13.427 --> 01:42:15.362
Colonel,
you can't turn the car.

01:42:15.363 --> 01:42:17.058
Where's
the turn, Charlie?

01:42:17.598 --> 01:42:21.067
3 o'clock? 2 o'clock?
Right oblique? Right face?

01:42:21.068 --> 01:42:22.764
Come on! Talk to me!

01:42:23.804 --> 01:42:25.438
It's left, I guess.

01:42:25.439 --> 01:42:28.102
Left. I knew it. Okay. Now?

01:42:29.710 --> 01:42:31.838
No, no! Not now! Not now!

01:42:33.114 --> 01:42:34.274
Now?

01:42:34.582 --> 01:42:35.882
Colonel, please!

01:42:35.883 --> 01:42:38.184
I'm gonna do it anyway,
all right?

01:42:38.185 --> 01:42:40.286
Whether you say so
or not, here we go!

01:42:40.287 --> 01:42:42.722
Okay! Wait, wait, wait!
Just wait!

01:42:42.723 --> 01:42:44.991
Here I go.

01:42:44.992 --> 01:42:46.926
Wait... Now!

01:42:53.401 --> 01:42:56.268
I did it! Charlie!

01:42:57.872 --> 01:43:00.705
You're ridin' with
one very happy man!

01:43:02.443 --> 01:43:03.810
Turn again!

01:43:03.811 --> 01:43:05.040
Be specific, son.

01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:06.880
Left now!

01:43:06.881 --> 01:43:07.973
Okay.

01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:15.749
I love this! I love it!

01:43:17.324 --> 01:43:19.190
Shall we take it to the max?

01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:20.950
Let me out.

01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:25.128
Shit!
The yellow flag.

01:43:26.067 --> 01:43:29.169
I haven't even
opened her up yet.
Which way's the curb?

01:43:29.170 --> 01:43:31.705
Pull over. Slow down!
Slow down.

01:43:31.706 --> 01:43:32.906
I'm doin' it.

01:43:32.907 --> 01:43:34.908
Pull over to
the curb, here.
Slow down.

01:43:34.909 --> 01:43:36.035
Yep. Got it.

01:43:49.557 --> 01:43:51.992
Haven't had
a ticket in years.

01:43:55.296 --> 01:43:57.025
I'll do the talking.

01:44:02.703 --> 01:44:04.694
License
and registration.

01:44:16.917 --> 01:44:18.985
Are you test-driving
this baby?

01:44:18.986 --> 01:44:20.886
Don't she purr, though?

01:44:21.455 --> 01:44:23.289
At 70 miles an hour?

01:44:23.290 --> 01:44:25.758
You should hear
her at 125.

01:44:27.561 --> 01:44:29.393
Where's your license?

01:44:30.965 --> 01:44:32.632
At the dealer's.

01:44:32.633 --> 01:44:35.295
They give it back
when you return the car.

01:44:36.303 --> 01:44:37.804
You got ID?

01:44:37.805 --> 01:44:39.364
You bet.

01:44:40.608 --> 01:44:41.973
Indeed.

01:44:45.913 --> 01:44:47.847
Lieutenant Colonel Slade.

01:44:48.482 --> 01:44:50.143
And you, soldier?

01:44:50.951 --> 01:44:53.477
The name is
Police Officer Gore.

01:44:55.322 --> 01:44:57.423
Doin' a hell
of a job, Gore.

01:44:57.424 --> 01:44:59.450
And so are you,
Colonel.

01:45:00.594 --> 01:45:02.085
Who's the kid?

01:45:03.164 --> 01:45:05.031
My boy Charlie.

01:45:05.032 --> 01:45:07.100
He kept tellin' me
to "let her out."

01:45:07.101 --> 01:45:09.331
What was I gonna do,
disappoint him?

01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:11.031
Yes.

01:45:14.942 --> 01:45:17.010
Tell you what
I'm gonna do,
Colonel.

01:45:17.011 --> 01:45:19.913
I'm gonna let you go,
on one condition.

01:45:19.914 --> 01:45:21.347
What's that?

01:45:21.649 --> 01:45:24.413
That you take this rig
straight back to the dealer.

01:45:26.687 --> 01:45:28.121
You got it.

01:45:28.122 --> 01:45:29.419
Shut up.

01:45:30.191 --> 01:45:31.590
You want this?

01:45:31.926 --> 01:45:33.223
Sure.

01:45:34.228 --> 01:45:35.787
Gore?

01:45:36.263 --> 01:45:39.098
Your face and
your voice
are familiar.

01:45:39.099 --> 01:45:41.830
You ever been
in the officer's
club at Da Nang?

01:45:42.736 --> 01:45:44.070
No.

01:45:44.071 --> 01:45:45.766
Never in the Army?

01:45:46.907 --> 01:45:48.534
No. Coast Guard.

01:45:49.176 --> 01:45:50.777
Good Lord.

01:45:56.116 --> 01:45:58.518
Your dad
is looking good,
Charlie.

01:45:58.519 --> 01:46:02.046
He's got a heavy foot, though.
Tell him to take it light,
all right?

01:46:03.424 --> 01:46:05.358
I hear ya!
All right.

01:46:05.359 --> 01:46:06.554
Thanks.

01:46:19.540 --> 01:46:22.709
Get out of the car,
because you are not
driving anymore.

01:46:22.710 --> 01:46:25.543
Just keeping this baby
warm, that's all.

01:46:27.381 --> 01:46:29.475
I'm not drivin' anymore.

01:46:33.921 --> 01:46:35.116
Yes.

01:46:40.461 --> 01:46:42.293
Take my arm.
I'm okay.

01:46:42.763 --> 01:46:45.130
Colonel,
it's really
bumpy here.

01:46:59.146 --> 01:47:00.739
You all right?

01:47:04.151 --> 01:47:05.209
Yeah.

01:47:13.394 --> 01:47:15.362
Red light. Hold it.

01:47:21.769 --> 01:47:23.362
Taking too long.

01:47:26.974 --> 01:47:29.943
Shit! Colonel! Colonel!

01:47:40.487 --> 01:47:41.750
Colonel!

01:47:42.423 --> 01:47:44.186
Shit! You all right?

01:47:45.259 --> 01:47:47.427
What the hell
are you doing?

01:47:47.428 --> 01:47:48.628
Take the cane.

01:47:48.629 --> 01:47:49.729
I gotta take a piss.

01:47:49.730 --> 01:47:50.963
Take the cane.

01:47:50.964 --> 01:47:52.398
Happens to
the best of us.

01:47:52.399 --> 01:47:54.434
We're on
Park Avenue.
You can't.

01:47:54.435 --> 01:47:55.925
Perfect place.

01:47:56.437 --> 01:47:58.171
You'll get arrested.

01:47:58.172 --> 01:48:00.106
Never been
housebroken.

01:48:01.208 --> 01:48:02.437
Colonel!
Shit!

01:48:02.743 --> 01:48:05.303
What's the matter
with you, Colonel?

01:48:11.518 --> 01:48:14.954
What are you doing?
Stand up.

01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:17.690
Come on.

01:48:17.691 --> 01:48:20.354
I'm tired, Charlie.
I'm tired.

01:48:22.463 --> 01:48:24.124
Give me your arm.

01:48:24.765 --> 01:48:26.392
Here's your cane.

01:48:27.735 --> 01:48:29.760
Take me back
to the hotel, son.

01:48:35.976 --> 01:48:37.808
Home at last.

01:48:59.133 --> 01:49:00.896
You all right now?

01:49:02.803 --> 01:49:03.895
Yeah.

01:49:07.875 --> 01:49:10.042
Do you want to
use the bathroom?

01:49:10.043 --> 01:49:11.136
No.

01:49:20.287 --> 01:49:21.754
Can I get you
something?

01:49:21.755 --> 01:49:22.882
No.

01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:28.561
You sure you're
all right?

01:49:28.562 --> 01:49:30.223
I'm fine, Charlie.

01:49:48.782 --> 01:49:51.250
Do you mind if
I use the phone?

01:49:51.251 --> 01:49:52.514
Go ahead.

01:50:11.672 --> 01:50:13.005
Hello?

01:50:13.006 --> 01:50:14.907
Hi, is George there,
please?

01:50:14.908 --> 01:50:16.569
Senior or Junior?

01:50:18.078 --> 01:50:19.445
Junior.

01:50:19.446 --> 01:50:21.013
Who's this?

01:50:21.014 --> 01:50:22.582
A friend of his
from school.

01:50:22.583 --> 01:50:26.679
Sorry, but George isn't going
to be talking to any friends
from school right now.

01:50:28.989 --> 01:50:29.979
Oh.

01:50:30.324 --> 01:50:31.553
Goodbye.

01:50:48.976 --> 01:50:51.342
Colonel, are you
looking at me?

01:50:54.081 --> 01:50:55.810
I'm blind, Charlie.

01:51:02.122 --> 01:51:03.954
I'm gonna take a nap.

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:08.558
Too much fresh air.

01:51:10.397 --> 01:51:12.559
It's probably a good idea.

01:51:13.133 --> 01:51:15.534
Want me to help you
to your room?

01:51:16.136 --> 01:51:17.194
No.

01:51:18.539 --> 01:51:19.733
Couch.

01:51:20.908 --> 01:51:22.808
I like this couch here.

01:51:26.079 --> 01:51:28.514
You sure you're
all right, Colonel?

01:51:28.515 --> 01:51:30.142
I got a headache.

01:51:36.456 --> 01:51:39.725
Why don't you go
downstairs, get me
some aspirin?

01:51:39.726 --> 01:51:42.696
Some aspirin.
Yeah. Also...

01:51:45.532 --> 01:51:47.296
I feel like a cigar.

01:51:48.835 --> 01:51:52.101
Get me a couple of
Montecristos Number One.

01:51:53.307 --> 01:51:54.774
Montecristos
Number One.

01:51:54.775 --> 01:51:55.942
Yeah.

01:51:55.943 --> 01:51:58.844
You won't be able
to get 'em at
the newsstand downstairs.

01:51:58.845 --> 01:52:00.871
So why don't you
go over to

01:52:01.615 --> 01:52:04.175
50th and Fifth,
Dunhill's.

01:52:04.985 --> 01:52:07.750
Fella named Arnold there,
in the humidor.

01:52:08.689 --> 01:52:11.317
Tell him
they're for me.

01:52:12.693 --> 01:52:13.887
He'll know.

01:53:02.943 --> 01:53:05.070
You're back
too fast.

01:53:07.881 --> 01:53:10.214
You didn't get
my cigars, did you?

01:53:15.555 --> 01:53:17.456
Get out of
here, Charlie.

01:53:21.795 --> 01:53:23.695
I thought we had a deal.

01:53:24.464 --> 01:53:28.424
I welched.
I'm a welcher.
Didn't I tell you?

01:53:29.970 --> 01:53:33.429
No, what you told me
was that you gave me
all the bullets.

01:53:33.807 --> 01:53:35.070
I lied.

01:53:36.977 --> 01:53:38.744
You could have fooled me.

01:53:38.745 --> 01:53:40.111
And I did.

01:53:43.016 --> 01:53:46.350
How you ever
gonna survive in this
world without me?

01:53:51.224 --> 01:53:54.251
Why don't you just
give me the gun,
all right?

01:54:03.170 --> 01:54:05.400
What are you doing?

01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:08.799
I'm gonna
shoot you, too.

01:54:11.912 --> 01:54:13.880
Your life's
finished anyway.

01:54:15.115 --> 01:54:18.050
Your friend George
is going to sing
like a canary.

01:54:18.051 --> 01:54:19.819
And so are you.

01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:22.380
And once you've sung,
Charlie, my boy,

01:54:22.656 --> 01:54:26.892
you're gonna take
your place on that
long, gray line

01:54:26.893 --> 01:54:28.725
of American manhood.

01:54:30.330 --> 01:54:32.526
And you will
be through.

01:54:34.201 --> 01:54:36.202
I'd like to disagree
with you, Colonel.

01:54:36.203 --> 01:54:38.571
You're in no
position to disagree
with me, boy.

01:54:38.572 --> 01:54:41.803
I got a loaded.45 here.
You got pimples.

01:54:42.809 --> 01:54:44.539
I'm gonna
kill ya, Charlie,

01:54:45.278 --> 01:54:47.313
because I can't
bear the thought

01:54:47.314 --> 01:54:49.009
of you sellin' out!

01:54:50.984 --> 01:54:53.552
Put the gun down,
all right, Colonel?

01:54:53.553 --> 01:54:56.682
What? You givin' me
an ultimatum?

01:54:57.057 --> 01:54:58.422
No, I'm...

01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:01.794
I give the ultimatums!

01:55:03.563 --> 01:55:04.895
I'm sorry.

01:55:06.833 --> 01:55:08.665
All right? I'm sorry.

01:55:11.938 --> 01:55:13.497
It's all right,

01:55:14.775 --> 01:55:16.208
Charlie.

01:55:21.181 --> 01:55:23.081
You break
my heart, son.

01:55:24.718 --> 01:55:26.550
All my life
I stood up

01:55:27.554 --> 01:55:29.545
to everyone
and everything,

01:55:31.024 --> 01:55:34.893
because it made me
feel important.

01:55:37.097 --> 01:55:39.532
You do it
'cause you mean it.

01:55:42.702 --> 01:55:44.432
You got
integrity, Charlie.

01:55:48.675 --> 01:55:52.009
I don't know whether to
shoot you or adopt you.

01:55:54.848 --> 01:55:57.316
Not much of a choice,
is it, sir?

01:55:57.317 --> 01:55:59.115
Don't get cute now.

01:55:59.886 --> 01:56:01.887
Could you please
put the gun away?

01:56:01.888 --> 01:56:03.686
I asked you
a question.

01:56:04.191 --> 01:56:07.092
Do you want me
to adopt you,
or don't you?

01:56:08.261 --> 01:56:09.888
Please? I mean...

01:56:11.498 --> 01:56:13.796
You're just in a slump
right now.

01:56:14.034 --> 01:56:15.160
Slump?

01:56:17.904 --> 01:56:19.668
No slump, Charlie.

01:56:22.008 --> 01:56:23.271
I'm bad.

01:56:26.179 --> 01:56:28.079
I'm not bad. No.

01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:32.241
I'm rotten.

01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:37.181
You're not bad.

01:56:40.494 --> 01:56:42.291
You're just in pain.

01:56:47.968 --> 01:56:50.232
What do you know
about pain?

01:56:54.007 --> 01:56:58.308
You little snail darter
from the Pacific Northwest.

01:56:59.479 --> 01:57:01.447
Fuck you know
about pain?

01:57:05.151 --> 01:57:07.416
Let me have the gun,
Colonel.

01:57:07.854 --> 01:57:09.982
No time to grow
a dick, son.

01:57:11.224 --> 01:57:13.921
Just give me the gun,
all right, Colonel?

01:57:15.862 --> 01:57:17.956
I'm talkin' a
parade ground.

01:57:18.164 --> 01:57:19.462
Ten-hut!

01:57:22.335 --> 01:57:25.567
Soldier, that was
a direct order.

01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:29.067
Give me the gun.

01:57:32.846 --> 01:57:35.542
You can stay or
you can leave.

01:57:36.716 --> 01:57:38.517
You understand?

01:57:38.518 --> 01:57:41.510
Either way, I'm gonna
do this thing.

01:57:44.157 --> 01:57:47.855
Now why don't
you leave and
spare yourself?

01:57:50.730 --> 01:57:52.721
I want your gun,
Colonel.

01:58:01.675 --> 01:58:03.905
I'm gonna give
myself a count.

01:58:09.215 --> 01:58:11.878
You need a count
for balance.

01:58:15.188 --> 01:58:16.588
Five...

01:58:17.757 --> 01:58:18.747
Four...

01:58:20.794 --> 01:58:22.227
Three...

01:58:24.230 --> 01:58:25.459
Two...

01:58:28.101 --> 01:58:29.227
One...

01:58:31.371 --> 01:58:32.497
Fuck it.

01:58:40.213 --> 01:58:41.943
Give me! Fuck!

01:58:45.251 --> 01:58:46.418
Get out of here!

01:58:46.419 --> 01:58:47.820
I'm stayin' right here!

01:58:47.821 --> 01:58:49.121
Get outta here!

01:58:49.122 --> 01:58:50.522
I'm stayin' right here.

01:58:50.523 --> 01:58:52.257
I'll blow your
fuckin' head off!

01:58:52.258 --> 01:58:53.892
Then do it!

01:58:53.893 --> 01:58:56.419
You want to do it?
Do it! Let's go.

01:59:02.502 --> 01:59:04.561
Get outta here!

01:59:05.939 --> 01:59:08.374
You fucked up,
all right? So what?

01:59:08.375 --> 01:59:10.241
So everybody does it.

01:59:10.877 --> 01:59:12.645
Get on with your life,
would ya?

01:59:12.646 --> 01:59:13.977
What life?

01:59:15.048 --> 01:59:17.073
I got no life!

01:59:19.219 --> 01:59:21.312
I'm in the dark here!

01:59:23.023 --> 01:59:24.547
You understand?

01:59:25.892 --> 01:59:27.451
I'm in the dark!

01:59:33.133 --> 01:59:34.566
So give up.

01:59:35.402 --> 01:59:38.971
You want to give up, give up.
Because I'm givin' up, too.

01:59:38.972 --> 01:59:41.407
You said I'm through.
You're right,
I am through.

01:59:41.408 --> 01:59:43.501
We're both through.
It's all over.

01:59:44.110 --> 01:59:46.445
So let's get on with it.
Let's fuckin' do it.

01:59:46.446 --> 01:59:48.676
Let's fuckin'
pull the trigger,

01:59:49.315 --> 01:59:51.580
you miserable
blind motherfucker.

01:59:59.926 --> 02:00:01.587
Pull the trigger.

02:00:03.630 --> 02:00:05.427
Here we go, Charlie.

02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:08.131
I'm ready.

02:00:16.076 --> 02:00:17.941
You don't want to die.

02:00:20.413 --> 02:00:22.211
And neither do you.

02:00:25.652 --> 02:00:28.314
Give me one
reason not to.

02:00:32.792 --> 02:00:34.021
I'll give you two.

02:00:34.461 --> 02:00:38.022
You can dance the tango
and drive a Ferrari better
than anyone I've ever seen.

02:00:44.404 --> 02:00:46.839
You never seen
anyone do either.

02:00:51.010 --> 02:00:53.138
Give me the gun,
Colonel.

02:01:04.057 --> 02:01:06.787
Where do I go
from here, Charlie?

02:01:08.294 --> 02:01:10.991
If you're tangled up,
just tango on.

02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:15.998
You askin' me
to dance, Charlie?

02:01:23.309 --> 02:01:26.111
Did you ever
have the feelin'

02:01:26.112 --> 02:01:27.978
That you wanted to go

02:01:29.682 --> 02:01:34.120
And still had the feelin'
that you wanted to stay?

02:01:50.637 --> 02:01:52.696
You like my blues,
Charlie?

02:01:56.075 --> 02:01:58.101
Yeah, they're beautiful.

02:01:59.445 --> 02:02:01.072
I wore these

02:02:02.916 --> 02:02:04.816
for Lyndon's
inauguration.

02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:11.450
Of course, we weren't
the number one ball.

02:02:15.028 --> 02:02:17.019
But he dropped by
anyway.

02:02:19.699 --> 02:02:21.963
Will you please
give me the gun?

02:02:25.972 --> 02:02:27.906
You're askin' an officer

02:02:29.042 --> 02:02:31.602
to surrender his sidearm.

02:02:33.012 --> 02:02:35.047
You don't have
to surrender it.

02:02:35.048 --> 02:02:37.414
Just put it down
for a little while.

02:02:38.284 --> 02:02:40.446
All right?
Just put it down.

02:02:52.198 --> 02:02:54.667
Boy, I could use
a drink, Charlie.

02:02:58.204 --> 02:03:00.298
How about a cup of coffee?

02:03:02.909 --> 02:03:06.178
Too big a leap for me
right now, Charlie.

02:03:06.179 --> 02:03:07.679
Maybe tomorrow.

02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:14.816
No, a Mr. John Daniels
would be preferred.

02:03:17.557 --> 02:03:19.218
No water,
Charlie.

02:03:21.861 --> 02:03:23.158
No water.

02:03:23.930 --> 02:03:25.193
Please.

02:03:33.239 --> 02:03:35.230
Here's your drink,
Colonel.

02:03:41.881 --> 02:03:43.872
Oh, I'm so sorry.

02:03:44.684 --> 02:03:47.352
What time do you want me
to turn down the bed?

02:03:47.353 --> 02:03:49.388
Maybe later,
all right?

02:03:49.389 --> 02:03:51.357
What he means,
se·orita,

02:03:52.525 --> 02:03:54.425
is come right in.

02:03:57.964 --> 02:03:59.432
Later, please?

02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:02.832
Yes, sir.
Good afternoon.

02:04:07.507 --> 02:04:08.997
Nice voice.

02:04:13.313 --> 02:04:15.713
Boy, you have
a one-track mind.

02:04:17.684 --> 02:04:20.710
Is there anything else
in this world, Charlie?

02:04:21.921 --> 02:04:23.446
Not for you.

02:04:24.524 --> 02:04:27.618
You know what's
kept me goin'
all these years?

02:04:28.328 --> 02:04:29.989
The thought

02:04:31.297 --> 02:04:33.732
that one day...

02:04:42.642 --> 02:04:43.939
Never mind.

02:04:45.178 --> 02:04:46.475
The what?

02:04:48.314 --> 02:04:49.679
Silly.

02:04:52.552 --> 02:04:55.351
Just the thought that
maybe one day, I'd...

02:04:59.359 --> 02:05:02.260
I could have a woman's arms
wrapped around me,

02:05:04.097 --> 02:05:06.361
and her legs
wrapped around me.

02:05:09.135 --> 02:05:10.432
And what?

02:05:15.274 --> 02:05:19.735
That I could wake up
in the morning and
she'd still be there.

02:05:21.147 --> 02:05:22.672
Smell of her.

02:05:24.150 --> 02:05:25.879
All funky and warm.

02:05:30.590 --> 02:05:32.490
I finally gave up on it.

02:05:35.762 --> 02:05:38.287
I don't know why
you can't have that.

02:05:41.334 --> 02:05:43.902
When we get back
to New Hampshire,

02:05:43.903 --> 02:05:46.463
I don't know why you
can't find someone.

02:05:46.773 --> 02:05:49.799
You're a good-lookin' guy

02:05:50.376 --> 02:05:52.401
and you're fun to be with

02:05:53.212 --> 02:05:56.148
and you're a great
travel companion,

02:05:56.716 --> 02:05:59.310
sensitive, compassionate.

02:06:03.389 --> 02:06:04.550
Charlie,

02:06:05.925 --> 02:06:07.984
are you fuckin' with me?

02:06:12.065 --> 02:06:13.191
Yes.

02:06:17.637 --> 02:06:18.866
Yeah?

02:06:19.672 --> 02:06:21.106
Hey, Manny.

02:06:26.345 --> 02:06:27.679
We missed our plane.

02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:29.815
Your plane, Charlie.

02:06:29.816 --> 02:06:31.613
My ticket was one-way.

02:06:33.619 --> 02:06:35.887
New England thruway
all the way, Colonel?

02:06:35.888 --> 02:06:37.720
All the way,
Manolo.

02:06:49.902 --> 02:06:52.895
I'm gettin' that heavy
feelin' again, Charlie.

02:06:54.707 --> 02:06:55.834
Uh...

02:06:56.742 --> 02:06:57.937
"Uh..."

02:06:58.978 --> 02:07:02.141
I think you were
right about George
and his father.

02:07:02.548 --> 02:07:04.583
I'm sorry
to hear that.

02:07:04.584 --> 02:07:09.421
When we get back Mr. Trask
is bringing us up
in front of the whole school.

02:07:09.422 --> 02:07:11.790
Puttin' your feet
to the fire?

02:07:11.791 --> 02:07:14.624
Special meeting of the
disciplinary committee.

02:07:16.229 --> 02:07:18.595
And what are you
gonna tell 'em?

02:07:21.467 --> 02:07:23.993
I don't know.
I'll think of somethin'.

02:07:25.905 --> 02:07:29.534
Charlie, why are you
all alone in this thing?

02:07:31.611 --> 02:07:33.374
Where's your father?

02:07:34.947 --> 02:07:36.438
He left.

02:07:37.884 --> 02:07:42.116
I thought it was a
mom-and-pop store.
Who's the pop?

02:07:42.655 --> 02:07:44.350
It's my stepfather.

02:07:45.358 --> 02:07:47.224
Oh, yeah.

02:07:49.328 --> 02:07:52.992
But why isn't
he in on this?
Somethin' wrong with him?

02:07:54.333 --> 02:07:56.859
No, he's okay. We just...

02:07:57.303 --> 02:07:58.970
We don't get along
very well.

02:07:58.971 --> 02:08:00.268
Why not?

02:08:02.008 --> 02:08:03.542
Because he's
an asshole.

02:08:08.214 --> 02:08:11.479
Well, that's
all right, Charlie.

02:08:13.686 --> 02:08:16.553
Every family's
got one nowadays.

02:08:46.452 --> 02:08:47.783
That's it?

02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:49.254
That's it.

02:08:49.255 --> 02:08:50.722
Take care of
yourself, kid.

02:08:50.723 --> 02:08:52.589
All right, Manny.
Thanks.

02:08:58.431 --> 02:09:00.422
No,
I'm not opening.

02:09:02.034 --> 02:09:03.593
I hate goodbyes.

02:09:06.205 --> 02:09:07.764
So...

02:09:08.541 --> 02:09:10.168
You'll be
all right, huh?

02:09:11.544 --> 02:09:13.034
I'll be fine.

02:09:14.547 --> 02:09:15.844
All right.

02:09:19.151 --> 02:09:20.710
What's that?

02:09:21.654 --> 02:09:23.383
That's first bell.

02:09:25.057 --> 02:09:27.492
Just got time
to get cleaned up.

02:09:30.863 --> 02:09:32.593
I almost forgot.

02:09:36.869 --> 02:09:38.837
I owe you
some money.

02:09:41.173 --> 02:09:44.336
$300.
Job well done.

02:09:48.547 --> 02:09:51.346
You ever need
any references, Charlie,
I'm your man.

02:09:53.486 --> 02:09:55.113
Thanks, Colonel.

02:10:01.894 --> 02:10:04.963
16 Water Street.
Over the bridge.

02:10:04.964 --> 02:10:06.454
We'll find it.

02:10:07.500 --> 02:10:09.229
Goodbye, Charlie.

02:10:10.936 --> 02:10:12.666
Goodbye, Colonel.

02:10:15.775 --> 02:10:17.402
Come here, son.

02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:35.525
Okay, Manny.

02:11:49.735 --> 02:11:51.704
George. George!

02:12:30.876 --> 02:12:33.711
I called an open meeting
of this institution
this morning

02:12:33.712 --> 02:12:37.015
because the incident
that occurred this
Tuesday last

02:12:37.016 --> 02:12:41.112
describes an issue
that concerns all of us.

02:12:42.555 --> 02:12:44.789
Not an isolated case
of vandalism.

02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:46.391
What happened

02:12:46.392 --> 02:12:50.021
is a symptom
of the sickness
of a society.

02:12:50.996 --> 02:12:56.230
A sickness which runs
counter to the principles
this school was founded on.

02:12:58.437 --> 02:13:00.839
A school among
whose graduates

02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:05.607
two have sat behind the
desk in the Oval O·ce,
in the White House.

02:13:06.712 --> 02:13:10.046
Baird men have
run State Departments
and investment houses,

02:13:10.816 --> 02:13:13.985
founded department stores
and coached football teams.

02:13:13.986 --> 02:13:17.422
Our alumni receive
their bulletins in
ashrams in India

02:13:17.890 --> 02:13:19.791
and in palaces in Jordan.

02:13:19.792 --> 02:13:22.293
We are, in fact,
known around the world

02:13:22.294 --> 02:13:25.463
as the cradle of this
country's leadership.

02:13:25.464 --> 02:13:27.499
A beacon in the...
What are you doing here?

02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:29.367
Got room for me
up there, Charlie?

02:13:29.368 --> 02:13:32.470
But today we are bleeding
from disrespect.

02:13:32.471 --> 02:13:33.738
Yeah, I guess so.

02:13:33.739 --> 02:13:35.607
Blatant disrespect.
Give us a hand.

02:13:35.608 --> 02:13:37.842
A disrespect
for our values,

02:13:37.843 --> 02:13:41.713
and a disrespect
for our standards.

02:13:41.714 --> 02:13:45.183
A disrespect for
the Baird tradition.

02:13:45.184 --> 02:13:47.949
And, as the custodians
of that tradition,

02:13:49.088 --> 02:13:53.286
we are here today
to protect each other

02:13:53.859 --> 02:13:56.351
from those who threaten it.

02:13:57.530 --> 02:13:59.464
Who is this, Mr. Simms?

02:14:01.667 --> 02:14:03.601
This is Mr. Frank Slade,

02:14:04.403 --> 02:14:07.634
Lieutenant Colonel,
United States Army,
retired.

02:14:08.941 --> 02:14:11.273
I'm here in place
of Charlie's parents.

02:14:11.543 --> 02:14:12.875
Excuse me?

02:14:13.145 --> 02:14:14.772
In loco parentis.

02:14:17.116 --> 02:14:20.385
They could not make
the trip from
Oregon today.

02:14:20.386 --> 02:14:23.421
And what is your
relationship to Mr. Simms?

02:14:23.422 --> 02:14:25.186
Is this a
courtroom?

02:14:26.125 --> 02:14:28.159
Closest thing
we could manage to it.

02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:31.824
Then if we're taking oaths,
there's a few people
I'd like to swear in.

02:14:34.166 --> 02:14:36.362
There are no oaths
at Baird.

02:14:37.436 --> 02:14:39.427
We are all on our honor.

02:14:41.407 --> 02:14:43.807
Larry and Franny Simms

02:14:44.176 --> 02:14:46.668
are very dear,
close friends of mine.

02:14:47.146 --> 02:14:50.343
They've asked me
to appear here on
Charlie's behalf.

02:14:51.283 --> 02:14:52.478
Okay?

02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:57.455
Happy to have you
with us, Colonel.

02:15:01.694 --> 02:15:03.025
Mr. Willis.

02:15:05.431 --> 02:15:07.165
Which Mr. Willis?

02:15:07.166 --> 02:15:08.599
George, Junior, sir.

02:15:13.639 --> 02:15:15.239
Yes.

02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:17.342
You were in a position
last Tuesday night

02:15:17.343 --> 02:15:20.836
to see who committed
this act of vandalism.
Who was it?

02:15:23.549 --> 02:15:26.884
Well, I have an idea
who it was.

02:15:26.885 --> 02:15:28.519
No, not an idea,
Mr. Willis.

02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:30.352
Did you see or
did you not see?

02:15:33.359 --> 02:15:34.690
Well...

02:15:36.462 --> 02:15:38.794
I didn't have
my contacts in.

02:15:42.868 --> 02:15:44.097
Come on.

02:15:47.973 --> 02:15:51.109
I was in the library.
I'd taken my glasses off,

02:15:51.110 --> 02:15:53.704
and I was gonna put
my contacts back in.

02:15:59.118 --> 02:16:00.918
Then I helped
Simms close up

02:16:00.919 --> 02:16:03.921
and the next thing
I know, we're outside,

02:16:03.922 --> 02:16:05.982
and I hear
this sound and I

02:16:08.127 --> 02:16:10.994
didn't have any time
to put my contacts in.

02:16:11.597 --> 02:16:14.293
Whom, with your
limited vision,
did you see?

02:16:31.884 --> 02:16:34.011
Like I say,
it was blurry.

02:16:39.892 --> 02:16:42.527
I can't see
without my contacts.

02:16:42.528 --> 02:16:44.928
What did you see,
Mr. Willis?

02:16:45.263 --> 02:16:46.458
What?

02:16:47.532 --> 02:16:48.933
You mean definitively?

02:16:48.933 --> 02:16:50.768
Stop fencing with me,
Mr. Willis!

02:16:50.769 --> 02:16:52.669
Tell me what you saw!

02:16:57.809 --> 02:17:02.041
Now, don't hold me to this,
but no contacts, it's dark...

02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:06.084
And everything, I mean...

02:17:06.084 --> 02:17:07.484
Mr. Willis!

02:17:10.656 --> 02:17:11.748
Maybe...

02:17:14.226 --> 02:17:16.126
Harry Havemeyer,

02:17:16.929 --> 02:17:19.921
Trent Potter and
Jimmy Jameson.

02:17:24.102 --> 02:17:25.303
Maybe?

02:17:25.304 --> 02:17:26.999
Ballpark, best guess.

02:17:29.208 --> 02:17:31.972
Could you provide us
with some detaiI?

02:17:34.580 --> 02:17:38.073
Why don't you ask Charlie?
I really think he was closer.

02:17:47.025 --> 02:17:48.357
Mr. Simms.

02:17:49.928 --> 02:17:51.429
Yes.

02:17:51.430 --> 02:17:54.198
You don't wear contact lenses,
do you?

02:17:54.199 --> 02:17:55.495
No, sir.

02:17:57.269 --> 02:18:00.103
With your
untrammeled sight,

02:18:00.105 --> 02:18:01.504
w£om did you see?

02:18:05.644 --> 02:18:07.441
Well, I saw something,

02:18:09.414 --> 02:18:11.883
but I couldn't say who.

02:18:12.618 --> 02:18:15.519
All right. What was
the something you saw?

02:18:19.424 --> 02:18:20.525
I couldn't say.

02:18:20.526 --> 02:18:22.254
You couldn't or wouldn't say?

02:18:25.030 --> 02:18:26.555
Well, I just...

02:18:30.536 --> 02:18:31.903
I just couldn't say.

02:18:31.904 --> 02:18:33.571
Couldn't, wouldn't, shouldn't.

02:18:33.572 --> 02:18:37.040
You're exhausting my patience
and making a mockery
of these proceedings.

02:18:37.041 --> 02:18:38.809
I will give you
one last chance.

02:18:38.811 --> 02:18:41.379
The consequences
of your response
will be dire.

02:18:41.379 --> 02:18:45.715
By dire, I mean
your future will be
jeopardized permanently.

02:18:47.352 --> 02:18:49.253
Now for the last time,

02:18:49.254 --> 02:18:53.623
w£at did you see
last Tuesday night
outside my office?

02:18:57.796 --> 02:18:59.629
I saw somebody.

02:18:59.630 --> 02:19:01.793
"I saw somebody." Good.

02:19:03.001 --> 02:19:05.368
Did you see their
size and shape?

02:19:06.839 --> 02:19:08.136
Yeah.

02:19:08.906 --> 02:19:11.570
And they were the size
and shape of whom?

02:19:17.049 --> 02:19:19.108
They were the size and shape

02:19:34.199 --> 02:19:36.361
of most any
Baird student, sir.

02:19:51.483 --> 02:19:53.747
I am left with
no real witness.

02:19:55.520 --> 02:19:59.523
Mr. Willis' testimony
is not only vague,
it is unsubstantiated.

02:19:59.524 --> 02:20:02.426
The substance I was
looking for, Mr. Simms,

02:20:02.427 --> 02:20:04.225
was to come from you.

02:20:07.899 --> 02:20:09.265
I'm sorry.

02:20:10.836 --> 02:20:12.895
I'm sorry, too, Mr. Simms,

02:20:13.772 --> 02:20:15.740
because you know
what I'm going to do

02:20:15.741 --> 02:20:18.409
inasmuch as I can't
punish Mr. Havemeyer

02:20:18.410 --> 02:20:20.678
Mr. Potter or Mr. Jameson?

02:20:20.679 --> 02:20:22.738
And I won't punish
Mr. Willis.

02:20:23.315 --> 02:20:25.316
He's the only party
to this incident

02:20:25.317 --> 02:20:28.287
w£o is still worthy
of calling himself
a Baird man.

02:20:29.554 --> 02:20:32.717
I'm going to recommend to
the disciplinary committee

02:20:34.559 --> 02:20:36.560
that you be expelled.

02:20:36.561 --> 02:20:40.798
Mr. Simms, you are
a cover-up artist
and you are a liar.

02:20:40.799 --> 02:20:42.733
But not a snitch!

02:20:44.236 --> 02:20:45.803
Excuse me?

02:20:45.804 --> 02:20:47.471
No, I don't think
I will.

02:20:47.472 --> 02:20:48.906
Mr. Slade.

02:20:48.907 --> 02:20:51.376
This is such
a crock of shit!

02:20:52.778 --> 02:20:55.012
Please watch
your language, Mr. Slade.

02:20:55.013 --> 02:20:57.915
You are in the Baird school,
not a barracks.

02:20:58.350 --> 02:21:01.319
Mr. Simms, I will
give you one final
opportunity to speak up.

02:21:01.320 --> 02:21:03.413
Mr. Simms
doesn't want it.

02:21:04.156 --> 02:21:05.756
He doesn't need
to be labeled

02:21:05.757 --> 02:21:08.124
"still worthy of
being a Baird man."

02:21:08.660 --> 02:21:10.661
What the hell is that?

02:21:10.662 --> 02:21:12.797
What is your motto here?

02:21:12.798 --> 02:21:16.968
"Boys, inform on
your classmates,
save your hide,

02:21:16.969 --> 02:21:20.404
"anything short of that,
we're gonna burn you
at the stake?"

02:21:20.405 --> 02:21:22.673
Well, gentlemen,

02:21:22.674 --> 02:21:26.110
when the shit hits the fan,
some guys run,

02:21:26.111 --> 02:21:27.845
and some guys stay.

02:21:27.846 --> 02:21:31.382
Here's Charlie,
facin' the fire,
and there's George,

02:21:31.383 --> 02:21:33.951
hidin' in big daddy's pocket.

02:21:33.952 --> 02:21:35.686
And what are you doin'?

02:21:35.687 --> 02:21:39.624
You're gonna reward George
and destroy Charlie.

02:21:41.393 --> 02:21:42.960
Are you finished,
Mr. Slade?

02:21:42.961 --> 02:21:45.089
No, I'm just gettin'
warmed up.

02:21:46.164 --> 02:21:48.265
I don't know
who went to
this place.

02:21:48.266 --> 02:21:53.037
William Howard Taft,
William Jennings Bryan,
William Tell, whoever.

02:21:53.038 --> 02:21:56.407
Their spirit is dead,
if they ever had one.

02:21:56.408 --> 02:21:57.808
It's gone.

02:21:57.809 --> 02:22:00.778
You're buildin'
a rat ship here,

02:22:00.779 --> 02:22:03.781
a vessel for
seagoin' snitches.

02:22:03.782 --> 02:22:07.618
And if you think
you're preparin' these
minnows for manhood,

02:22:07.619 --> 02:22:09.253
you better think again,

02:22:09.254 --> 02:22:12.156
because I say you are
killin' the very spirit

02:22:12.157 --> 02:22:15.422
this institution
proclaims it instills.

02:22:16.261 --> 02:22:17.962
What a sham.

02:22:17.963 --> 02:22:20.965
What kind of a show
are you guys puttin'
on here today?

02:22:20.966 --> 02:22:24.535
The only class
in this act is
sittin' next to me.

02:22:24.536 --> 02:22:28.305
And I'm here
to tell you this boy's
soul is intact.

02:22:28.306 --> 02:22:31.142
It's non-negotiable.
You know how I know?

02:22:31.143 --> 02:22:34.806
Someone here,
and I won't say who,
offered to buy it.

02:22:35.247 --> 02:22:37.348
Only Charlie
here wasn't sellin'.

02:22:37.349 --> 02:22:38.883
Sir, you're
out of order.

02:22:38.884 --> 02:22:41.218
I'd show you
out of order.

02:22:41.219 --> 02:22:44.288
You don't know what
out of order is,
Mr. Trask.

02:22:44.289 --> 02:22:46.524
I'd show you,
but I'm too old,

02:22:46.525 --> 02:22:49.126
I'm too tired,
I'm too fuckin' blind.

02:22:49.127 --> 02:22:54.566
If I were the man I was
five years ago, I'd take
a flamethrower to this place!

02:22:57.669 --> 02:23:00.798
Out of order? Who the hell
you think you're talkin' to?

02:23:02.407 --> 02:23:04.535
I've been around, you know?

02:23:05.210 --> 02:23:07.406
There was a time
I could see.

02:23:07.879 --> 02:23:09.472
And I have seen.

02:23:10.048 --> 02:23:12.450
Boys like these,
younger than these,

02:23:12.451 --> 02:23:15.784
their arms torn out,
their legs ripped off.

02:23:16.354 --> 02:23:19.523
But there is nothin'
like the sight

02:23:19.524 --> 02:23:21.425
of an amputated spirit.

02:23:21.426 --> 02:23:24.293
There is no prosthetic
for that.

02:23:26.031 --> 02:23:29.600
You think you're merely
sendin' this splendid
foot soldier

02:23:29.601 --> 02:23:32.870
back home to Oregon with
his tail between his legs,

02:23:32.871 --> 02:23:36.808
but I say you are
executin' his soul!

02:23:38.076 --> 02:23:39.407
And why?

02:23:40.345 --> 02:23:42.712
Because he's not
a Baird man.

02:23:43.381 --> 02:23:46.317
Baird men.
You hurt this boy,

02:23:46.318 --> 02:23:49.083
you're gonna be Baird bums,
the lot of you.

02:23:49.254 --> 02:23:51.518
And, Harry, Jimmy,

02:23:52.357 --> 02:23:55.126
Trent, wherever you are
out there,

02:23:55.127 --> 02:23:56.685
fuck you, too!

02:23:59.297 --> 02:24:01.265
Stand down, Mr. Slade!

02:24:01.266 --> 02:24:02.756
I'm not finished.

02:24:03.969 --> 02:24:08.272
As I came in here,
I heard those words,

02:24:08.273 --> 02:24:10.241
"cradle of leadership."

02:24:11.476 --> 02:24:16.947
Well, "when the bough breaks,
the cradle will fall,"
and it has fallen here.

02:24:16.948 --> 02:24:18.649
It has fallen.

02:24:18.650 --> 02:24:21.752
Makers of men,
creators of leaders.

02:24:21.753 --> 02:24:25.121
Be careful what
kind of leaders
you're producin' here.

02:24:26.091 --> 02:24:30.294
I don't know if Charlie's
silence here today
is right or wrong.

02:24:30.295 --> 02:24:31.896
I'm not a judge orjury.

02:24:31.897 --> 02:24:33.764
But I can tell you this,

02:24:33.765 --> 02:24:37.531
he won't sell anybody out
to buy his future!

02:24:38.803 --> 02:24:42.001
And that, my friends,
is called integrity.

02:24:42.941 --> 02:24:44.942
That's called courage.

02:24:44.943 --> 02:24:48.106
Now that's the stuff
leaders should be made of.

02:24:53.652 --> 02:24:57.179
Now I have come to
the crossroads in my life.

02:24:58.323 --> 02:25:01.657
I always knew what
the right path was.

02:25:02.661 --> 02:25:06.028
Without exception, I knew,
but I never took it.

02:25:06.498 --> 02:25:07.988
You know why?

02:25:08.633 --> 02:25:11.603
It was too damn hard.

02:25:13.238 --> 02:25:16.407
Now here's Charlie.
He's come to
the crossroads.

02:25:16.408 --> 02:25:19.867
He has chosen a path.
It's the right path.

02:25:20.879 --> 02:25:24.542
It's a path made of principle
that leads to character.

02:25:27.552 --> 02:25:29.953
Let him continue
on his journey.

02:25:32.057 --> 02:25:35.516
You hold this boy's future
in your hands, committee.

02:25:36.761 --> 02:25:39.430
It's a valuable future,

02:25:39.431 --> 02:25:40.762
believe me.

02:25:41.533 --> 02:25:44.229
Don't destroy it.
Protect it.

02:25:45.904 --> 02:25:47.303
Embrace it.

02:25:48.039 --> 02:25:51.202
It's gonna make you
proud one day,
I promise you.

02:26:08.793 --> 02:26:10.728
How's that
for cornball?

02:26:32.283 --> 02:26:34.343
Nothing can
shut them up, sir.

02:26:38.857 --> 02:26:42.092
The disciplinary
committee will take
this matter under advisement

02:26:42.093 --> 02:26:44.289
in closed session.

02:26:52.304 --> 02:26:54.499
What are they doin',
Charlie?

02:26:55.306 --> 02:26:58.470
I think they're
going to come to
a decision now.

02:27:01.780 --> 02:27:03.111
Very well.

02:27:08.620 --> 02:27:11.487
Apparently, that meeting
will be unnecessary.

02:27:12.290 --> 02:27:13.781
Mrs. Hunsaker.

02:27:17.996 --> 02:27:23.300
The joint student-faculty
disciplinary committee
needs no further sessions.

02:27:23.301 --> 02:27:26.003
They have come to a decision.

02:27:26.004 --> 02:27:28.639
Messrs. Havemeyer,
Potter and Jameson

02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:30.540
are placed on probation

02:27:31.076 --> 02:27:34.045
for suspicion of
ungentlemanly conduct.

02:27:34.312 --> 02:27:37.681
It is further recommended
that Mr. George Willis, Jr.

02:27:37.682 --> 02:27:40.951
Receive neither recognition
nor commendation

02:27:40.952 --> 02:27:42.750
for his cooperation.

02:27:44.189 --> 02:27:46.457
Mr. Charles Simms is excused

02:27:46.458 --> 02:27:49.226
from any further response
to this incident.

02:27:49.227 --> 02:27:50.327
Hoo-ah!

02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:29.992
Charlie!

02:28:49.988 --> 02:28:51.288
Last step.

02:28:51.289 --> 02:28:53.553
I can always count
on you, Charlie.

02:28:56.761 --> 02:28:58.229
Colonel!

02:29:01.800 --> 02:29:03.700
I'm Christine Downes,
Colonel Slade.

02:29:03.701 --> 02:29:05.435
I teach
political science.

02:29:05.436 --> 02:29:08.906
I wanted to tell you
how much I appreciate
you speaking your mind.

02:29:08.907 --> 02:29:10.773
Why, thank you.
Are you married?

02:29:11.409 --> 02:29:12.843
I...

02:29:15.747 --> 02:29:19.383
Went to an artillery school
at Fort Sill with
a Mickey Downes.

02:29:19.384 --> 02:29:21.151
Thought he might've
snagged you.

02:29:21.152 --> 02:29:23.314
No, I'm afraid not.

02:29:24.989 --> 02:29:28.892
Colonel Slade was on
Lyndon Johnson's staff,
Miss Downes.

02:29:28.893 --> 02:29:31.261
Were you? Fascinating.

02:29:31.262 --> 02:29:33.959
We should get together,
talk politics sometime.

02:29:37.869 --> 02:29:39.701
Fleurs de Rocaille.

02:29:41.406 --> 02:29:42.532
Yes.

02:29:44.142 --> 02:29:46.235
"Flowers from a brook."

02:29:47.812 --> 02:29:49.246
That's right.

02:29:53.051 --> 02:29:56.885
Well, Miss Downes,
I'll know where to find you.

02:29:59.057 --> 02:30:00.557
Charlie.

02:30:00.558 --> 02:30:01.992
Bye, Miss Downes.

02:30:01.993 --> 02:30:03.222
Bye.

02:30:06.498 --> 02:30:09.023
You don't have to
tell me, Charlie.

02:30:09.601 --> 02:30:10.727
5'7",

02:30:12.337 --> 02:30:14.100
auburn hair,

02:30:15.073 --> 02:30:17.564
beautiful brown eyes.

02:30:36.160 --> 02:30:37.822
Yabba-dabba-doo.

02:30:42.634 --> 02:30:43.794
Manny.

02:30:46.504 --> 02:30:48.071
Colonel, this
is too much.

02:30:48.072 --> 02:30:49.606
Never mind,
you earned it.

02:30:49.607 --> 02:30:51.208
Next time Charlie and I

02:30:51.209 --> 02:30:54.278
want to take a
breather to New York,
we're gonna call you.

02:30:54.279 --> 02:30:56.046
You can drive us
both ways.

02:30:56.047 --> 02:30:57.481
You're on,
Colonel.

02:30:57.482 --> 02:30:59.249
Not only will it
be an honor,

02:30:59.250 --> 02:31:00.584
I'll give you
a rate.

02:31:00.585 --> 02:31:03.287
I'll see your rate
and raise you.

02:31:03.288 --> 02:31:05.122
Stay outta
harm's way, Manny.

02:31:05.123 --> 02:31:06.323
Take care,
Colonel.

02:31:06.324 --> 02:31:07.621
You, too.

02:31:08.393 --> 02:31:10.862
Ready?
No. I'll take it
from here.

02:31:11.963 --> 02:31:13.397
You go on ahead.

02:31:13.398 --> 02:31:15.662
Manny'll drive you
to your dorm.

02:31:17.101 --> 02:31:19.803
Come by before you
go home for Christmas.

02:31:19.804 --> 02:31:22.072
We'll have a little cheer.

02:31:22.073 --> 02:31:24.641
And if you like,
stay for dinner.

02:31:24.642 --> 02:31:27.678
Sometimes she cooks
a pot roast.

02:31:27.679 --> 02:31:29.340
It's almost edible.

02:31:30.815 --> 02:31:33.450
All right, Colonel.
That'd be really...

02:31:33.451 --> 02:31:34.919
Bye, Charlie.

02:31:54.839 --> 02:31:58.575
Who's there?
That you, Francine?

02:31:58.576 --> 02:31:59.643
Yes.

02:31:59.644 --> 02:32:00.944
What are you doing?

02:32:00.945 --> 02:32:02.980
Taking a ride.

02:32:02.981 --> 02:32:04.715
Taking a ride?

02:32:04.716 --> 02:32:07.150
What about you
giving me a lift?

02:32:07.151 --> 02:32:08.352
No.

02:32:08.353 --> 02:32:09.479
No?

02:32:09.988 --> 02:32:11.751
Come on, Francine.

02:32:12.290 --> 02:32:15.282
We should make up.
Don't you think
it's time we made up?

02:32:15.793 --> 02:32:17.160
No.

02:32:17.161 --> 02:32:18.895
Francine?
What?

02:32:18.896 --> 02:32:20.263
Uncle Frank's had

02:32:20.264 --> 02:32:24.201
a really hard
Thanksgiving weekend.

02:32:25.870 --> 02:32:28.464
What's that?
I hear a chipmunk.

02:32:29.073 --> 02:32:30.973
Is it a walrus?

02:32:31.242 --> 02:32:32.835
No, it's Willie.

02:32:33.244 --> 02:32:35.979
Willie, why don't you
help me with my bag?

02:32:35.980 --> 02:32:38.449
Come on, son.
Help me with my bag.

02:32:38.750 --> 02:32:40.980
Come on. Come on.

02:32:41.419 --> 02:32:45.014
You got it. Hold onto it.
You're strong. Come on.

02:32:47.358 --> 02:32:48.792
Here we are.

02:32:50.028 --> 02:32:52.588
Francine, come on
with me and Willie.

02:32:52.830 --> 02:32:55.599
I'll let you make me
some marshmallow
chocolate.

02:32:55.600 --> 02:32:57.295
What do you say?

02:32:57.602 --> 02:32:58.592
Good!
