00:02.002 --> 00:03.993
(underwater gurgling,
bubeng)

00:13.764 --> 00:15.800
"Perfect Day" playing

00:25.859 --> 00:28.726
J‘ Just a perfect day J‘

00:30.113 --> 00:33.480
J‘ Drink sangria in the park J‘

00:34.868 --> 00:37.029
J‘ And then later J‘

00:37.204 --> 00:40.696
J‘ When it gets dark,
we go home J‘

00:46.171 --> 00:49.254
J‘ Just a perfect day J‘

00:50.259 --> 00:53.672
J‘ You made me
forget myself J‘

00:55.264 --> 00:58.756
J‘ I thought
I was someone else J‘

00:58.934 --> 01:00.640
J‘ Someone good... J‘

01:02.688 --> 01:04.303
Chris's voice:
Another one burned last night.

01:04.481 --> 01:06.017
Better than TV.

01:06.191 --> 01:09.479
People outside the fence, they took
the last of them four days ago.

01:09.653 --> 01:12.861
Peoplejust like us run like cattle,

01:13.031 --> 01:15.864
piled into trucks,
one suitcase apiece.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.070
Headed east.
At least that's the rumor.

01:18.245 --> 01:21.328
Bakersfield, Vegas,
who knows?

01:22.916 --> 01:26.329
J‘ You just keep me hanging on... J‘

01:26.503 --> 01:28.243
Chris's voice:
It's safe inside the fence.

01:28.422 --> 01:32.085
Outside, everything's dead,
everyone's gone.

01:32.259 --> 01:35.342
This is, uh, day nine.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.503
Nine days since
the lights went out

01:37.681 --> 01:41.265
and that fence went up

01:41.435 --> 01:43.926
and our little green friends
moved in.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.435
Soldier:
Let's roll!

01:45.606 --> 01:48.598
Travis says we're the lucky ones.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.687
He'd throw those dudes a parade
if they'd let him.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.103
And, look...

01:54.281 --> 01:57.068
we are grateful to our saviors,

01:57.242 --> 01:59.574
to the ones who protect us,

01:59.745 --> 02:01.827
to those who know

02:01.997 --> 02:05.160
when it's feeding time
at the zoo.

02:05.334 --> 02:08.167
Turns out there's nothing you'll
ever take that nature won't take back.

02:08.337 --> 02:09.622
(chirping)

02:09.796 --> 02:11.912
It all belongs to her again.

02:12.090 --> 02:16.208
And the dogs
and the dead and the...

02:16.386 --> 02:21.130
J‘ You just keep me hangin' on J‘

02:21.308 --> 02:26.143
J‘ You just keep me
hangin' on... J‘

02:26.313 --> 02:27.974
Hello.

02:28.148 --> 02:34.144
(theme music playing )

02:45.165 --> 02:47.030
(ticking )

02:57.177 --> 03:00.419
Hey, we have to repaint
the family room.

03:00.597 --> 03:01.757
We did last week.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.217
I know,
it needs a new coat.

03:03.392 --> 03:04.973
Travis found some more paint
in the garage.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.178
( sighs )
What's the point?

03:06.353 --> 03:09.095
Semi-gloss.
What? Excuse me?

03:09.272 --> 03:10.478
I mean, no one's coming
to the open house, Mom.

03:10.649 --> 03:13.607
- Market's taken a bit of a turn.
- I can still see the stains.

03:13.777 --> 03:16.268
Hey, you can see the ocean.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.528
( panting )

03:18.699 --> 03:20.690
What? Still not on?

03:20.867 --> 03:24.280
Oh, they probably don't want to strain
whatever's left of the grid.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.864
Don't worry.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.995
They're gonna get it sorted.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.667
Oh, my God.

03:29.835 --> 03:32.702
( laughs)

03:32.879 --> 03:34.870
- Where are you going?
- Huh?

03:35.048 --> 03:38.381
Moyers, he's making
some kind of announcement.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.587
He asked me to attend.

03:39.761 --> 03:42.548
Well, we wouldn't want
to upset him, would we?

03:42.723 --> 03:44.588
Okay.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.631
- What's the problem?
- Uh, how much time do you have?

03:46.810 --> 03:48.766
- Maddy...
- My house is a refugee camp,

03:48.937 --> 03:51.303
my daughter's room
is an ICU unit for strangers.

03:51.481 --> 03:52.732
Someone has to cook,
someone has to clean...

03:52.899 --> 03:55.231
- Listen, calm down.
- ...someone has to watch Nick.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.393
- Well--
- And that someone, somehow, is me.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.061
'Cause I don't know
where your ex-wife goes.

03:59.239 --> 04:02.402
She's helping sick people.
Is this about Liza?

04:02.576 --> 04:05.113
- What? No, it's about you.
- Me?

04:05.287 --> 04:07.699
Yeah, you run off to play
man of the people...

04:07.873 --> 04:09.579
- I'm not playing.
- ...with your soldier friends...

04:09.750 --> 04:11.240
- This is not easy.
- ...I could use a bit of help here--

04:11.418 --> 04:13.750
Stop. Oh, my God,
just stop it.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.127
This domestic bickering
like it's normal,

04:16.298 --> 04:18.914
like you're normal people
in a normal kitchen.

04:19.092 --> 04:22.459
It's not normal. Stop it.
Stop acting like it is.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.597
You ready to go?

04:27.768 --> 04:29.679
Please.

04:41.490 --> 04:42.855
Do it.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.149
Come on, just do it.

04:45.327 --> 04:46.783
Come on.

04:53.168 --> 04:55.204
(grunts)

04:56.713 --> 04:58.294
Chris, what do you think
you're doing?

04:58.465 --> 05:00.126
- Get down here.
- Dad, you gotta see this.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.506
Chris, now.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.632
I want you
to help Madison, okay?

05:03.804 --> 05:05.169
Okay, just look at this.

05:05.347 --> 05:08.510
- I don't have time for--
- Just five seconds. Look.

05:12.354 --> 05:14.219
There, you see that?

05:14.397 --> 05:15.557
See what?
What am I looking at?

05:15.732 --> 05:17.188
It's like a light or a glint,

05:17.359 --> 05:19.645
but they said there's
nothing alive out there.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.731
Okay, come inside.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.020
Dad, I think
there's someone out there.

05:23.198 --> 05:24.483
There's no one out there.

05:24.658 --> 05:28.321
It's just the sun's caught
some reflection and...

05:29.538 --> 05:32.655
You got to stop, okay?

05:34.084 --> 05:35.915
(grunts)

05:40.173 --> 05:41.674
Come on.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.178
I found this on the counter.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.560
Oh, yeah, I guess I forgot.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.516
Oh, you forgot?

05:57.691 --> 05:59.272
Yeah.

05:59.442 --> 06:02.024
I guess I did.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.652
- Okay, here it is.
- Oh, no, thanks. I'm good.

06:04.823 --> 06:06.438
I don't think that's the best idea.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.698
Well, I got to kick it.
That's the whole point, right?

06:08.869 --> 06:10.609
Nick, come on.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.748
- Nick--
- Look, give it to Griselda.

06:17.919 --> 06:20.035
She needs it more than I do.
You said so yourself.

06:20.213 --> 06:25.424
I know what I said, but the point
is to wean you off of it slowly.

06:25.594 --> 06:28.131
So itjust doesn't,
you know, happen again.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.091
I thought you'd be happy.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.298
lam happy, ljust...

06:33.476 --> 06:35.262
(water splashes )

06:37.397 --> 06:41.106
Okay, well, if you need it,
it's right here.

06:41.276 --> 06:43.938
- Don't be a hero.
- No chance of that.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.396
- Hey, Mom?
- Yeah?

06:47.574 --> 06:49.064
Are you okay?

06:49.242 --> 06:51.403
Enjoy your swim.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.328
All right,
listen up here, folks.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.581
( radio chatter)

06:58.752 --> 07:01.494
As commanding officer
of this detachment,

07:01.671 --> 07:05.255
lam proud to announce
that we are infect free

07:05.425 --> 07:08.167
for a six mile radius
around this perimeter.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.552
We are on the offensive.

07:10.722 --> 07:13.134
The tide has
most definitely turned.

07:13.308 --> 07:14.844
- Yeah.
- ( scattered applause )

07:15.018 --> 07:18.761
All right, command asked
that | read from the following.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.271
"Be advised,
the D2 remains off-limits

07:21.441 --> 07:23.773
while Hazmat teams dispose
of any bio-hazardous material."

07:23.944 --> 07:25.684
Woman:
What bio-hazardous material?

07:25.862 --> 07:27.602
Hey, I'm supposed to read this,
you're supposed to listen, okay?

07:27.781 --> 07:29.692
Man:
When will you get the phones up?

07:29.866 --> 07:32.608
"Anyone attempting
to compromise or circumvent

07:32.786 --> 07:34.777
the perimeter of this camp
will be detained."

07:34.955 --> 07:36.695
Man #2:
Are we being relocated?

07:36.873 --> 07:39.034
Sir, this is a secure position,
so, no, you're gonna stay put.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.700
"Curfew will remain in effect
until further notice.

07:41.878 --> 07:44.210
The new health screening policy
will continue.

07:44.381 --> 07:47.293
Sanitation, water treatment,
and other services will return

07:47.467 --> 07:48.798
as we approach
total containment."

07:48.969 --> 07:50.960
Sir, we need medicine.
What about that?

07:51.137 --> 07:53.298
We are working on that.
"So keep boiling that water.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.886
You will also find several
iodine tablets in your weekly rations."

07:57.060 --> 07:59.142
Where are the people outside the fence?
Where did you move them?

07:59.312 --> 08:00.688
Crowd:
Where? Where?

08:00.855 --> 08:03.141
All right, folks, listen.

08:03.316 --> 08:07.480
You are in one of 12 safe zones

08:07.654 --> 08:09.610
south of the San Gabriels, okay?

08:09.781 --> 08:11.737
So you guys
are the lucky ones.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.775
You guys-- you get
to stay in your homes,

08:14.953 --> 08:16.784
ride this thing out,
all right?

08:16.955 --> 08:21.039
So, relax, count your blessings,
be nice.

08:21.209 --> 08:23.825
So I don't have to shoot you.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.710
Yeah.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.461
What's your name, miss?

08:27.632 --> 08:28.838
Uh, Alicia Clark.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.374
Oh, Clark.
Yeah, right here.

08:30.552 --> 08:33.589
(crowd murmuring)

08:33.763 --> 08:35.344
,2;

08:35.515 --> 08:38.222
( laughs )
Ofelia Salazar.

08:38.393 --> 08:42.181
Oh, could you spell that for me?

08:42.355 --> 08:46.018
S-A-L-A...
you're not even looking.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.853
Oh.
Yeah, no, here it is.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.394
Um, Ofelia.

08:55.744 --> 08:56.859
( chattering )

08:57.037 --> 08:59.198
- Mr. Manawa?
- Yes-- sir?

08:59.372 --> 09:01.033
Moyers:
A word, please.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.418
Come on.

09:04.586 --> 09:07.703
- Soldier: Have a nice day.
- Ofelia: Yeah, you, too.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.247
Man: Just one case per family, ma'am.
That's how it goes.

09:10.425 --> 09:12.711
Moyers: Guy who lives in this house
with the covered car, Thompson.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.626
- Doug Thompson? Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.385
So, he won't do the screening.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.716
And his wife thinks
for some reason

09:17.891 --> 09:19.722
maybe you could talk
some sense into him.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.134
Well, I don't really know him.

09:22.312 --> 09:25.145
We had a beer once, and he showed me
his car he's rebuilding.

09:25.315 --> 09:26.395
You're a gearhead?

09:26.566 --> 09:29.023
Well, I've kept my father's Ford going
for over 30 years.

09:29.194 --> 09:30.980
Dude, 30 years!
That is so great.

09:31.154 --> 09:32.564
Can you help me or no?

09:32.739 --> 09:36.106
- It's just I don't really know the guy.
- Okay.

09:36.284 --> 09:39.742
Okay, thing is here
is I'm trying to avoid a situation.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.279
So either you're gonna go in
and you're gonna talk him down,

09:42.457 --> 09:45.073
or I'm gonna go in,
I'm gonna take him down.

09:45.251 --> 09:48.118
- Yeah or no?
- Okay.

09:48.296 --> 09:50.958
Good.
Gloves on, let's go.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.642
How long's he been in there?

10:08.817 --> 10:13.026
He was acting strange yesterday,
and then at dinner he, uh...

10:13.196 --> 10:15.812
Maria, how long?

10:15.990 --> 10:18.572
Since then.
Since dinner last night.

10:18.743 --> 10:21.450
The soldiers wanted
to talk to him, but I thought--

10:21.621 --> 10:24.112
I thought it would be better
if it was from someone he knew,

10:24.290 --> 10:26.406
and he's liked you
so much, so...

10:34.008 --> 10:35.794
( knocks )

10:35.969 --> 10:37.675
Doug?

10:40.640 --> 10:42.255
Doug?

10:46.980 --> 10:48.470
Doug?

10:59.492 --> 11:01.983
(door creaking )

11:04.497 --> 11:05.873
What's going on?

11:06.040 --> 11:07.701
Hey, Trav.

11:09.711 --> 11:11.747
You're worrying
your family, man.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.422
I know that.

11:13.590 --> 11:16.673
But I don't--

11:16.843 --> 11:18.834
I don't think I can do it.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.588
Do what?

11:22.765 --> 11:25.222
( crows cawing )

11:40.200 --> 11:41.440
Take it easy.
Take it easy.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.154
They keep asking me
what's happening.

11:43.328 --> 11:45.364
They keep asking me
if everything's gonna be okay

11:45.538 --> 11:48.655
and |-- I don't have the words.

11:50.376 --> 11:53.038
It is gonna be okay.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.413
That's what you say.

11:59.344 --> 12:01.426
That's all that you have to say.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.138
Will they know that I'm lying?

12:09.729 --> 12:13.642
Doug, your family needs you.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.642
Now.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.561
They need you
to go outside that door

12:19.739 --> 12:21.900
and tell that guard
that you're gonna be okay.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.736
Show 'em that you're okay.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.782
- ( sniffles )
- That's all.

12:28.957 --> 12:31.243
( sighs )
Yeah.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.836
( exhales )

12:37.006 --> 12:39.748
- ( birds chirping)
- ( objects tinkling)

14:18.775 --> 14:20.515
(crying)

14:31.120 --> 14:33.031
Hang in there, buddy.

14:39.796 --> 14:41.707
(tinkling)

14:43.383 --> 14:46.045
(machine humming)

14:49.680 --> 14:51.807
Hey, handsome.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.965
I got to go.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.475
You have plenty ofjuice
for the night, okay?

14:56.646 --> 14:58.477
Mm-hmm.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.815
He's stable.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.600
Morphine's helping.

15:04.779 --> 15:06.940
You can't stay?
I made some soup.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.481
Squash from my garden.

15:09.659 --> 15:11.570
l have other people
to check on.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.486
Please take some with you.

15:14.664 --> 15:17.576
You must have seen
a lot of people like Hector.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.490
At the hospital?

15:19.669 --> 15:21.330
Yes.

15:26.968 --> 15:28.924
Take it.

15:29.095 --> 15:32.178
I don't know
what I would have done.

15:32.348 --> 15:34.589
Hector is all l have.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.596
Thank you.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.769
Woman: Thank you, Liza.
See you tomorrow.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.951
(sighs)

16:09.969 --> 16:12.460
- Why show me that?
- Do you see it?

16:12.638 --> 16:14.754
I mean,
why not show your dad?

16:14.932 --> 16:17.844
I tried.
He just said it wasn't anything.

16:18.019 --> 16:19.099
Well, maybe he's right.

16:19.270 --> 16:21.477
It could just be a piece
of metal or a window

16:21.647 --> 16:23.262
or, you know, I don't know.

16:23.441 --> 16:25.807
Look, there's a pattern, okay?

16:25.985 --> 16:27.646
Someone's out there.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.651
A human someone,
someone who needs our help.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.062
We don't know that.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.650
What else could it be?
Why else would it just--

16:32.825 --> 16:34.656
If someone needs help,
they go to the soldiers.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.692
Unless they can't.

16:36.871 --> 16:38.407
Or they won't.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.078
Do you see it?

16:47.173 --> 16:50.040
- ( machine humming)
-( labored breathing )

17:24.627 --> 17:26.538
Man on radio:
3-2 Echo, this is Bravo Actual.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.919
Standing by for a sit-rep, over.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.249
3-2 Echo,
this is Bravo Actual...

17:33.427 --> 17:35.554
Don't you have to get that?

17:35.721 --> 17:36.801
They'll leave a message.

17:36.973 --> 17:39.134
( laughs)

17:46.899 --> 17:49.561
You're in my head all day.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.441
I can't concentrate.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.819
( laughs, gasps)

17:59.412 --> 18:01.277
(moaning)

18:02.790 --> 18:05.327
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.

18:05.501 --> 18:06.581
( exhales )

18:06.752 --> 18:08.458
Maybe we should just
slow down a little.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.915
Right.
Yeah, we should.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.331
- Sorry. Are you upset?
- No.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.750
No, it's okay.
ljust--

18:17.096 --> 18:19.337
I like you, Ofelia.
That's all.

18:19.515 --> 18:20.721
Yeah, you're like the only thing

18:20.891 --> 18:23.758
that makes me believe
there's still good in people.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.973
Hey, of course there is.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.608
Hey, um...

18:33.779 --> 18:35.610
did you get the medicine?

18:35.781 --> 18:38.944
I tried.
I asked the corpsman.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.278
What'd he say?

18:40.453 --> 18:42.318
They got it all locked down tight.

18:42.496 --> 18:43.872
I guess they're stockpiling

18:44.040 --> 18:47.532
for the big push
to take the city back.

18:47.710 --> 18:50.417
lt'sjust, um, my mom's
really sick, so...

18:50.588 --> 18:53.295
Yeah, I know that.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.081
( scoffs )

18:55.259 --> 18:57.341
Man on radio:
3-2 Echo, lnterrogative:

18:57.511 --> 18:59.092
- Where the hell is my damn truck?
- I'm sorry.

19:02.183 --> 19:04.139
Bravo Actual,
this is 3-2 Echo.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.016
Finishing patrol.

19:06.187 --> 19:07.643
Heading back.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.354
- ( gate buzzes )
-( radio chatter)

19:17.323 --> 19:19.814
( panting )

19:22.828 --> 19:25.035
Was that make-up sex?

19:25.206 --> 19:26.537
We got to fight more.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.243
( chuckles )

19:28.417 --> 19:30.999
( panting )

19:31.170 --> 19:32.876
Whoo.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.509
Hey.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.840
What's the hurry?
I thought that was nice.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.004
- It was.
- ( exhales )

19:44.225 --> 19:45.681
I got things to do.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.012
Can't it wait?

19:48.187 --> 19:50.018
Come here.

19:52.274 --> 19:53.775
Come back.

19:56.404 --> 19:58.520
( belt buckle clinking )

19:58.698 --> 20:00.734
(sighs)

20:00.908 --> 20:02.409
What's going on?

20:03.744 --> 20:04.984
I don't know.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.369
There's no news from anywhere.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.076
Vivian said she heard soldiers

20:09.250 --> 20:12.367
talking about quarantine camps
out near Barstow.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.044
I mean, I don't know.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.546
She's a gossip, but...

20:17.717 --> 20:20.550
No, I meant with you.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.711
What's going on with you?

20:22.888 --> 20:26.722
I mean, you're buzzing around here
all day every day,

20:26.892 --> 20:29.008
driving yourself nuts.

20:29.186 --> 20:31.802
I mean, you hover, clean,

20:31.981 --> 20:33.562
watch Alicia and Nick
like a hawk.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.769
Nick needs to be watched.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.524
Yeah, I know.

20:37.695 --> 20:39.231
Still.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.145
Well, if we're exchanging
parenting tips,

20:41.323 --> 20:43.575
you might want to pay
more attention to Chris.

20:43.743 --> 20:44.983
Oh, okay.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.402
I mean, all I do all day
is pay attention to--

20:47.580 --> 20:49.241
Positive attention.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.582
All right.

20:53.753 --> 20:57.917
How come I feel like I'm being
called into your office?

20:59.133 --> 21:00.464
Hmm?

21:02.011 --> 21:03.626
I missed you.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.260
He showed me the video
he took from the roof.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.925
Jesus, that kid has got
a world-class imagination.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.810
- You know that.
- I saw it, too.

21:13.981 --> 21:17.439
- I did.
- Yeah? Okay.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.020
What did you see?

21:19.195 --> 21:22.107
I don't know, like a--
like a light.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.862
- Mm-hmm.
- Like someone reflecting the sun.

21:24.033 --> 21:26.866
Great.
So you saw a light.

21:27.036 --> 21:28.651
What am I supposed
to do with that?

21:28.829 --> 21:30.740
Go to Moyers and say, what?

21:30.915 --> 21:32.621
"|-- my kid saw a light,

21:32.792 --> 21:35.955
so your soldiers, tell them
to drop their duties and--"

21:36.128 --> 21:37.163
That is their duty.

21:37.338 --> 21:38.794
lt's nine days.
What have they done?

21:38.964 --> 21:41.250
They promised
medicine, doctors,

21:41.425 --> 21:43.165
electricity, information.

21:43.344 --> 21:45.551
Where is it?
What about the phones?

21:45.721 --> 21:47.586
Don't you wonder
why they can't get a landline?

21:47.765 --> 21:49.221
- No, I don't wonder.
- Cell towers? Nothing?

21:49.391 --> 21:50.722
Maybe they got something bigger
to worry about.

21:50.893 --> 21:52.804
Well, maybe they don't
want the phones to work.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.764
Oh, babe, are you
listening to yourself?

21:54.939 --> 21:56.019
You're talking paranoid.

21:56.190 --> 21:57.896
I don't want
to encourage this with Chris,

21:58.067 --> 21:59.682
and you shouldn't either.

22:01.237 --> 22:02.898
So you did see it.

22:03.072 --> 22:06.064
Maria:
Travis! Travis!

22:06.242 --> 22:09.405
- ( Maria knocking ) Travis!
- lt's Maria.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.193
( knocking continues)

22:11.372 --> 22:12.828
Maria?

22:12.998 --> 22:14.704
What are you doing out?
It's past curfew.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.081
They can shoot me.

22:16.252 --> 22:17.958
- What's wrong?
- Doug's gone.

22:18.128 --> 22:19.117
l was in the back of the house
with the girls

22:19.296 --> 22:20.285
and I don't know where he went.

22:20.464 --> 22:21.704
All right, calm down, calm down.
Just breathe.

22:21.882 --> 22:23.838
He's missing.
Okay, what did you say to him?

22:24.009 --> 22:26.842
- I didn't say anything.
- He took his car.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.843
He took his stupid, precious car
and I don't know where he went.

22:29.014 --> 22:31.050
- Okay, let's take the girls inside.
- No, they stay with me.

22:31.225 --> 22:32.305
Look, I'm sure he's fine.

22:32.476 --> 22:34.216
He's just clearing his head
somewhere, that's all.

22:34.395 --> 22:36.010
We're not allowed to drive
inside the fence, Travis.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.179
- It's not allowed.
- I know, I know. I understand.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.518
So what-- what if he--
oh, my God.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.649
No, look, just don't go there,
please, all right?

22:42.820 --> 22:46.233
I'm gonna find him.
I'll find your dad, all right?

22:46.407 --> 22:48.022
We'll find him, yeah?

22:48.200 --> 22:49.906
Come on,
I'll walk you home.

22:54.707 --> 22:57.198
(birds chirping)

23:16.937 --> 23:19.394
(bird warbling)

23:26.906 --> 23:28.646
Shit.

24:00.481 --> 24:03.018
Ah, Christ.
I hooked it.

24:03.192 --> 24:05.274
Travis:
His wife's worried he went over.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.651
I'm just asking
that you send out one patrol.

24:07.821 --> 24:10.153
- He hasn't been missing long.
- He's not missing.

24:10.324 --> 24:11.780
We pulled Doug Thompson
last night.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.236
Found him up by the fence

24:13.410 --> 24:16.026
bawling his eyes out
in his damn muscle car.

24:16.205 --> 24:20.118
That guy, man, he is--
he's a head case.

24:20.292 --> 24:23.034
Can't have that around camp.

24:23.212 --> 24:24.952
God damn it!

24:26.799 --> 24:28.130
Don't look at me like that.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.086
It's not my order,
though I agree with it.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.340
You should, too.

24:31.512 --> 24:32.718
You talked to the guy,
didn't you?

24:32.888 --> 24:35.254
He seem okay to you?

24:35.432 --> 24:37.423
- No.
- No.

24:37.601 --> 24:38.807
So what are we talking about?

24:38.978 --> 24:40.809
Thompson gets the help
he so desperately needs

24:40.980 --> 24:42.470
back at headquarters,

24:42.648 --> 24:46.607
I don't have to worry about some guy
going psycho inside the fence.

24:46.777 --> 24:47.812
That's a win-win.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.978
You could've notified
his wife, sir.

24:50.155 --> 24:52.316
I'm not a social worker.

24:52.491 --> 24:53.822
That's yourjob, Mr. Mayor.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.905
Now, you go ahead
and notify away.

24:58.747 --> 25:00.487
What?

25:01.667 --> 25:04.909
My son,
he saw a light in the D2

25:05.087 --> 25:07.874
up on the hillside.

25:08.048 --> 25:10.164
There's nothing alive out there.
He didn't see anything.

25:12.344 --> 25:16.007
We, uh-- we went house to house,
block by block.

25:16.181 --> 25:17.887
I know.

25:18.058 --> 25:19.138
Forget it.

25:19.309 --> 25:20.765
Already did.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.267
Oh, that's money.

25:30.696 --> 25:32.436
( knocks )

25:35.409 --> 25:37.195
Cynthia?

25:39.705 --> 25:40.945
Cynthia?

25:48.505 --> 25:50.882
Liza, there you are.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.756
Where's Hector?

25:52.926 --> 25:55.383
Getting the care he needs.

25:55.554 --> 25:56.714
Who are you?

25:56.889 --> 25:58.470
l'm Dr. Exner.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.301
Cynthia:
She's from the government.

26:00.476 --> 26:02.137
Cynthia's told me all about you.

26:02.311 --> 26:04.142
Oh.

26:04.313 --> 26:05.393
What did she tell you?

26:05.564 --> 26:08.146
That you're the reason
why her husband's alive.

26:08.317 --> 26:09.557
That you're a very good nurse.

26:09.735 --> 26:10.941
Cynthia:
Nurse practitioner.

26:11.111 --> 26:13.227
That's basically a doctor.

26:15.407 --> 26:16.487
Where did you take Hector?

26:16.658 --> 26:19.070
Sit down.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.235
I want to see him.

26:21.413 --> 26:24.246
Cynthia was kind enough
to show me this chart,

26:24.416 --> 26:26.327
and I'll admit I'm not familiar
with some of these--

26:26.502 --> 26:28.458
Look, I should
explain this to you--

26:28.629 --> 26:30.620
Cynthia, do you mind
if Liza and I speak privately?

26:30.798 --> 26:32.254
Oh, no, no, no.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.289
That's great.
Of course.

26:34.468 --> 26:38.461
( sighs )
I should get packed anyways.

26:38.639 --> 26:41.426
Liza, you're an angel.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.761
Oh...

26:49.691 --> 26:51.431
Where's she going?

26:51.610 --> 26:54.272
She wanted to be
with her husband.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.232
Where is that?

26:56.406 --> 26:59.614
You used a morphine drip.
Unorthodox.

26:59.785 --> 27:04.199
|, uh-- I didn't have
any nitrates,

27:04.373 --> 27:07.115
so I had to salvage
from another neighbor.

27:07.292 --> 27:10.204
I needed to find a way to get
the pressure off of his heart.

27:10.379 --> 27:11.789
What about your other patients?

27:11.964 --> 27:13.374
I've already met four people

27:13.549 --> 27:15.961
that swear you're the reason
they're alive.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.501
I'm just making them
comfortable.

27:18.679 --> 27:21.295
Hector's the only crit case.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.304
Well, you did very well,

27:23.475 --> 27:26.182
considering you're
not actually a nurse.

27:26.353 --> 27:28.218
Are you?

27:36.155 --> 27:39.568
He was gonna die.
I didn't know what else to do.

27:39.741 --> 27:44.030
I needed to get her to trust me
so that she could let me--

27:44.204 --> 27:45.489
so that I can help.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.871
It's all right.
Desperate times.

27:51.378 --> 27:54.586
Perhaps you'd be willing
to pretend a little longer?

27:54.756 --> 27:57.213
Excuse me?

28:29.374 --> 28:31.786
(snapping )

29:18.090 --> 29:20.797
(wind blowing)

29:40.862 --> 29:42.477
Oh!

29:42.656 --> 29:44.021
(gags)

29:44.199 --> 29:46.906
(flies buzzing )

30:01.008 --> 30:03.169
(flies buzzing )

30:25.407 --> 30:27.147
Ah!

30:28.535 --> 30:30.400
( radio chatter)

30:41.506 --> 30:44.498
( radio chatter)

30:46.678 --> 30:48.714
(flies buzzing )

31:13.622 --> 31:14.907
It was under control.

31:15.082 --> 31:16.367
l drained it.

31:16.541 --> 31:19.283
We change the dressing
twice a day.

31:19.461 --> 31:21.372
No antibiotics,
this was always the outcome.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.377
It's not anything you did.

31:23.548 --> 31:24.583
We're gonna take care of you.

31:24.758 --> 31:26.874
(speaking Spanish )

31:29.679 --> 31:31.806
How are you gonna do this?

31:31.973 --> 31:33.349
We have a facility nearby.

31:33.517 --> 31:36.509
- Military facility?
- lt's military now, fortified.

31:36.686 --> 31:39.098
We have beds, surgeons,

31:39.272 --> 31:42.355
which, I'm afraid, is what
your wife's injury requires.

31:42.526 --> 31:44.062
( speaks Spanish )

31:45.862 --> 31:48.399
My wife would like to know
how far this place is.

31:48.573 --> 31:50.188
Close, 15 minutes.

31:50.367 --> 31:52.153
Not a lot of traffic these days.

31:53.453 --> 31:54.784
I'm going with her.

31:54.955 --> 31:57.162
Of course.
She's your wife.

31:59.793 --> 32:01.954
( speaks Spanish )

32:02.129 --> 32:03.619
Uh-huh.

32:07.592 --> 32:10.800
- ( Griselda speaking Spanish )
- No, no, no, no, no.

32:10.971 --> 32:14.680
(speaking Spanish )

32:14.850 --> 32:17.341
- No, no, no, no.
- ( crying)

32:17.519 --> 32:19.601
( kisses )

32:19.771 --> 32:22.148
( radio chatter)

32:24.943 --> 32:26.228
Nick?

32:27.612 --> 32:29.352
- Nick.
- What?

32:29.531 --> 32:31.362
This is Dr. Exner.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.993
Hi.

32:36.163 --> 32:38.404
I understand you may
be in need of methadone.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.916
Well, lwould love methadone
if I was trying to kick,

32:43.086 --> 32:45.042
which I've already done.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.163
When's the last time you used?

32:48.341 --> 32:51.424
Uh, I don't know.
When did the world end?

32:51.595 --> 32:53.426
Couple of days before that.

32:56.766 --> 32:57.801
What's this?

32:57.976 --> 33:01.013
Overdue house calls.
I'm Dr. Exner.

33:01.188 --> 33:02.428
Oh, Travis.

33:02.606 --> 33:04.722
Can't tell you how happy we are
to see you.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.936
Um, is something wrong
with Nick?

33:07.110 --> 33:08.270
Nick:
No, I'm fine.

33:08.445 --> 33:11.061
But your ex-wife, man,
she's a narc.

33:11.239 --> 33:13.491
Told this lady I was
the neighborhood dope fiend.

33:13.658 --> 33:15.614
( beeps )

33:15.785 --> 33:17.992
98.6.

33:18.163 --> 33:20.199
I'm gonna check
your blood pressure.

33:20.373 --> 33:23.365
So are you the one that decides
who goes to this facility?

33:23.543 --> 33:26.410
Exnen
Well, l have some help, but, yes.

33:26.588 --> 33:27.828
Like Doug Thompson?

33:28.006 --> 33:29.837
I can't discuss other patients.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.966
Liza: Excuse him.
He worries about everyone else.

33:33.136 --> 33:35.001
Your friend is in good hands.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.340
Just like Hector Ramirez.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.972
Just like Griselda will be.

33:40.185 --> 33:42.392
You okay, Nick?

33:42.562 --> 33:43.677
Yeah.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.595
Uh, yeah, yeah.

33:45.774 --> 33:48.015
ls Mr. Ramirez okay?

33:48.193 --> 33:50.229
Congestive heart disease
is manageable.

33:53.657 --> 33:55.943
Your heart rate's elevated.

33:56.117 --> 33:59.029
You're a very attractive woman.

33:59.204 --> 34:01.661
(objects tinkling )

34:12.634 --> 34:15.250
( exhales )

34:23.061 --> 34:25.097
Daniel:
Where did you go?

34:25.272 --> 34:28.139
Madison:
Outside the fence.

34:28.316 --> 34:29.897
What did you see?

34:34.072 --> 34:35.573
( door closes)

34:37.993 --> 34:39.984
- Madison: Who is that?
- Daniel: That's the doctor.

34:40.161 --> 34:43.028
She wants to take my wife
and do surgery on her.

34:43.206 --> 34:45.413
Well, that's good.

34:47.669 --> 34:49.250
Tell me what you saw.

34:56.011 --> 34:57.626
Bodies.

34:59.347 --> 35:01.212
Yes.

35:01.391 --> 35:03.097
The infected.

35:03.268 --> 35:04.804
But...

35:04.978 --> 35:07.515
Go on.

35:07.689 --> 35:09.896
There was a man

35:10.066 --> 35:13.024
shot like the others,
like the rest,

35:13.194 --> 35:15.480
but he-- he wasn't sick.

35:16.865 --> 35:19.402
And there were others like that.

35:26.416 --> 35:27.997
When I was young...

35:29.711 --> 35:31.997
these men--

35:32.172 --> 35:33.662
these men were
from the government.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.957
They came to our town
and they took some people away.

35:38.011 --> 35:41.128
And my father was someone

35:41.306 --> 35:42.762
of certain importance
in the community,

35:42.932 --> 35:45.674
so he went to speak
to the captain

35:45.852 --> 35:48.468
and asked,
"When will they return?"

35:49.773 --> 35:54.016
And the captain told my father,
"Miguel, don't worry.

35:54.194 --> 35:56.401
They always come home."

35:58.490 --> 36:00.355
And they did.

36:02.410 --> 36:06.073
l was standing
in the river fishing.

36:06.247 --> 36:07.987
Just a boy.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.202
And I found them.

36:11.378 --> 36:14.495
All of them.
All at once.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.288
All around me.

36:16.466 --> 36:18.252
In the water.

36:20.595 --> 36:24.179
My father told me
not to have hatred in my heart.

36:25.517 --> 36:30.352
He said that men do these things
not because of evil.

36:30.522 --> 36:33.855
They do evil because of fear.

36:34.984 --> 36:39.603
And at that moment,
I realized my father is a fool

36:39.781 --> 36:42.523
for believing
there was a difference.

36:43.827 --> 36:48.537
If it happens,
it will happen quickly

36:48.707 --> 36:50.322
and you must be prepared.

36:50.500 --> 36:53.492
Yeah, if what-- what happens?

36:53.670 --> 36:55.456
I must go with my wife.

36:55.630 --> 36:59.919
If I don't return,
you will look after Ofelia for me.

37:00.093 --> 37:01.549
She's a grown woman.
She doesn't need--

37:01.720 --> 37:03.085
Please.

37:03.263 --> 37:07.552
You will look after Ofelia
for me, please.

37:12.355 --> 37:14.141
Thank you.

37:25.243 --> 37:27.234
Keep your son close.

37:36.713 --> 37:38.669
( radio chatter)

37:42.802 --> 37:44.963
(tinkling)

37:58.610 --> 37:59.895
( items clatter)

38:10.455 --> 38:12.286
(sighs)

38:19.214 --> 38:21.079
What do you want me to say?

38:28.223 --> 38:29.929
You don't know.

38:30.099 --> 38:31.635
What?

38:36.731 --> 38:39.393
You have no idea.

38:39.567 --> 38:41.603
You have no idea.

38:45.740 --> 38:47.651
( panting )

38:59.838 --> 39:02.420
- ( crickets chirping )
- ( radio chatter)

39:06.761 --> 39:08.422
Go away.
You gotta leave.

39:08.596 --> 39:09.676
What the hell happened
to your face?

39:09.848 --> 39:11.554
Knock, for Christ's sake.
Go away!

39:11.724 --> 39:13.009
Stop, Nick, let me
just have a look at it.

39:13.184 --> 39:14.560
Nick!

39:14.727 --> 39:16.433
- Let me in.
- What's going on?

39:16.604 --> 39:17.889
Let me in.

39:18.064 --> 39:20.851
( knocking )
Nick. What happened?

39:21.025 --> 39:23.937
Travis, stop, look.
Let me just...

39:24.988 --> 39:26.478
I got it, okay?

39:27.991 --> 39:29.731
Okay.

39:33.872 --> 39:36.830
Alicia:
Nick, he's gone.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.490
Come on, let me in.

39:38.668 --> 39:40.078
-( knocks)
- ( sighs)

39:41.546 --> 39:43.411
Do you want me to get Mom?

39:46.551 --> 39:48.667
(sighs)

39:58.563 --> 40:01.350
Who did that to you?

40:01.524 --> 40:04.482
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

40:04.652 --> 40:06.984
You want to talk about it?

40:07.155 --> 40:08.986
Hey, hey, it's okay.

40:09.157 --> 40:10.442
It's okay.

40:10.617 --> 40:12.027
(sighs)

40:20.335 --> 40:22.075
It's okay.

40:28.217 --> 40:30.128
( breathing heavily )

40:35.683 --> 40:37.423
(vehicle approaching )

40:37.602 --> 40:40.264
( tires screech )

40:40.438 --> 40:43.396
- ( doors open, close)
-( brakes squeal )

40:43.566 --> 40:46.148
( men shouting )

40:48.446 --> 40:50.653
- ( speaking Spanish )
- ( Griselda moans)

40:50.823 --> 40:53.485
( all speaking Spanish )

40:57.205 --> 40:58.285
Liza:
All right.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.037
This is good, this is good.

41:00.208 --> 41:02.415
Okay, come on.
All right.

41:02.585 --> 41:04.041
- Careful.
- Soldier: Okay, let's go.

41:04.212 --> 41:06.123
(speaking Spanish )

41:06.297 --> 41:09.460
- Liza: Gentle.
- Hey, I don't know how long we will be.

41:09.634 --> 41:12.296
- Soldier: Let's go to your right.
- Okay.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.711
What the hell is going on?

41:14.889 --> 41:17.722
- Liza: Gentle.
- Hey. Whoa, hey, hey. What's all this?

41:17.892 --> 41:20.224
If we don't get Griselda to the surgeon,
she's gonna lose the foot.

41:20.395 --> 41:22.010
- You're in the way.
- All right, okay.

41:22.188 --> 41:24.679
- All right, step. Good.
- ( groans )

41:24.857 --> 41:26.597
- Soldier: Here we go. Lead on.
- Liza: Okay.

41:26.776 --> 41:28.141
- Sir, I'll need you to wait.
- Liza: All right...

41:28.319 --> 41:29.650
No, that's okay.
That's his wife.

41:29.821 --> 41:32.358
Come on, come on.
(speaking Spanish )

41:32.532 --> 41:33.692
l have two names.

41:33.866 --> 41:35.993
Griselda Salazar,
Daniel Salazar.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.536
No, not you.

41:37.704 --> 41:39.911
- Nicholas Clark.
- What?

41:40.081 --> 41:43.244
Come on, man.
Free medical, care of the US Military.

41:43.418 --> 41:45.033
Run.

41:45.211 --> 41:46.417
- Travis: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey!

41:46.587 --> 41:48.498
That's a mistake.
No, no, that's a mistake.

41:48.673 --> 41:51.289
- That's a mistake. Nick--
- Alicia: Wait. Hey! Hold on!

41:51.467 --> 41:53.332
- Madison: No, no, no!
- Take it easy. Take it easy.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.012
- Back off, sir.
- Don't you hurt him. Nick!

41:55.179 --> 41:57.010
Stand down.
Stand down, ma'am.

41:57.181 --> 41:58.682
- Madison: Nick!
- Come on.

41:58.850 --> 42:01.466
- No, he's not sick.
- Calm down, ma'am.

42:01.644 --> 42:04.021
(speaking Spanish )

42:06.607 --> 42:09.940
- ( arguing )
- Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

42:10.111 --> 42:11.226
Travis:
Easy!

42:11.404 --> 42:12.610
- Dad!
- Take it easy.

42:12.780 --> 42:14.031
- Soldier: Step back.
- What are you doing?

42:14.198 --> 42:15.529
Take it easy, man!
He's a kid!

42:15.700 --> 42:16.860
It's an old man and a kid.

42:17.035 --> 42:18.525
What are you doing?
This is our home.

42:18.703 --> 42:20.318
Hey, I didn't do anything, man.

42:21.330 --> 42:22.786
I didn't do anything.

42:22.957 --> 42:24.072
Soldier:
Get him in.

42:24.250 --> 42:26.206
Let Nick stay.
He's not a risk.

42:26.377 --> 42:27.708
I'll look after him.
Please.

42:27.879 --> 42:29.494
- You said you wanted to help.
- Yeah.

42:29.672 --> 42:31.879
- I do, yes, but--
- Then get in the truck.

42:32.050 --> 42:33.915
We could use you
in the hospital.

42:34.093 --> 42:36.175
He knows me, please.
Just let me talk to Moyers.

42:36.345 --> 42:37.380
What does it matter?

42:37.555 --> 42:39.546
Travis: Would you just let me
talk to Moyers?

42:39.724 --> 42:41.430
No.

42:43.686 --> 42:45.847
No! No, Nick!

42:49.817 --> 42:51.478
Soldier:
We're set!

42:51.652 --> 42:53.938
Soldier #2:
Convoy's moving out!

42:55.740 --> 42:57.321
l have a son.
He needs me.

42:57.492 --> 43:00.325
We'll come back for your son.
He's safe here for now.

43:00.495 --> 43:03.487
But Griselda, the others,
they need you.

43:03.664 --> 43:05.450
I need you.

43:07.668 --> 43:09.249
You coming?

43:09.420 --> 43:11.411
- Soldier: Let's go!
- Soldier #2: What's the hold-up?

43:11.589 --> 43:13.420
Exnen

43:14.467 --> 43:17.083
- Soldier: Get her up. Come on, lady.
- ( mouths words )

43:19.430 --> 43:22.046
Soldier #2: Come on, lady.
Are you coming or not?

43:23.434 --> 43:24.514
Mom?

43:24.685 --> 43:26.596
( whispers )
Don't worry.

43:26.771 --> 43:28.682
All right, clear out.

43:31.275 --> 43:32.890
Chris:
Mom.

43:35.947 --> 43:38.188
Where is he?
Where did you take him?

43:38.366 --> 43:40.698
Where is he?
No-- Nick!

44:07.812 --> 44:09.097
Chris?

44:18.364 --> 44:20.275
Liza.

44:20.449 --> 44:21.825
She did this.

44:51.105 --> 44:55.815
Alicia's voice: "Patrick,
if you find this, I'm sorry.

44:57.653 --> 45:00.486
If you find this, I love you.

45:03.492 --> 45:07.201
I saw something today,
something that horrified me.

45:07.371 --> 45:09.862
At first, I thought
it was unnatural.

45:10.041 --> 45:12.202
I thought it was an aberration.

45:12.376 --> 45:14.367
But I was wrong.

45:14.545 --> 45:16.957
What I saw was prophesized.

45:17.131 --> 45:19.463
What I saw was godly.

45:19.634 --> 45:22.091
And I think it's overdue.

45:22.261 --> 45:25.970
| wish you were here,
but I will see you soon.

45:26.140 --> 45:27.880
And you will hold me."

45:35.816 --> 45:36.976
( distant gunfire )

45:37.151 --> 45:41.064
Alicia's voice:
"If you find this, lam sorry."

45:41.239 --> 45:43.776
(gunfire continues)

45:43.950 --> 45:47.158
Alicia's voice:
"If you find this, I love you."

45:51.999 --> 45:54.957
(music playing )
