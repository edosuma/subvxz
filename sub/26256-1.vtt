02:06.792 --> 02:07.791
Quick! To the safe room!

02:07.792 --> 02:10.542
Run and you're dead!

02:11.875 --> 02:13.582
We want hostages, not dead bodies!

02:13.583 --> 02:15.874
Open up or we'll kill you!

02:15.875 --> 02:19.207
Hurry! I can't hold on much longer!

02:19.208 --> 02:20.207
<i>Mayday! mayday!</i>

02:20.208 --> 02:21.916
This is Chinese merchant ship, Guangdong.

02:21.917 --> 02:24.333
<i>We're under pirates attack!
We're under pirates attack!</i>

02:34.167 --> 02:35.417
They're coming up!

02:45.750 --> 02:47.249
<i>This is the Chinese Navy.</i>

02:47.250 --> 02:49.041
<i>Stop the ship immediately!</i>

02:49.042 --> 02:50.707
<i>This is the Chinese Navy.</i>

02:50.708 --> 02:52.416
<i>Stop the ship immediately!</i>

02:52.417 --> 02:53.541
<i>Captain.</i>

02:53.542 --> 02:57.041
<i>Jiaolong Unit One and Unit Two
are near the hostage area.</i>

02:57.042 --> 03:00.749
<i>Jiaolong Unit Three is in the engine room
trying to stop the ship.</i>

03:00.750 --> 03:02.417
<i>Alpha position, report your situation.</i>

03:05.167 --> 03:08.667
<i>Reporting. There are 3 pirates
and 15 hostages on the bridge.</i>

03:20.417 --> 03:21.917
<i>Beta position, report your situation.</i>

03:38.917 --> 03:42.292
Canteen target locked. Over.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.707
Reporting. They disabled the fuel valves.

03:54.708 --> 03:56.499
<i>We can't turn off the fuel supply.</i>

03:56.500 --> 03:59.041
<i>I'll cut the power and stop the ship.</i>

03:59.042 --> 03:59.999
<i>Captain, Commissar.</i>

04:00.000 --> 04:01.499
They picked up the speed!

04:01.500 --> 04:03.124
How much time is left?

04:03.125 --> 04:04.082
Sir.

04:04.083 --> 04:06.582
The ship is traveling at 23 knots.

04:06.583 --> 04:07.666
At this speed,

04:07.667 --> 04:10.624
we'll be in Somalian waters in 15 minutes.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.082
Captain.

04:12.083 --> 04:15.082
We must not enter territorial waters.

04:15.083 --> 04:16.541
Rui Yang,

04:16.541 --> 04:19.624
you have ten minutes.

04:19.625 --> 04:21.374
Attention, everyone.

04:21.375 --> 04:24.874
For the hostages' safety, attack as one.

04:24.875 --> 04:26.250
Wait for the orders. Over.

04:28.083 --> 04:29.291
Left flank, roger.

04:29.292 --> 04:30.416
Sniper's hide.

04:30.417 --> 04:31.624
<i>Roger.</i>

04:31.625 --> 04:33.166
<i>Can you get a fix on them?</i>

04:33.167 --> 04:34.416
<i>If not,</i>

04:34.417 --> 04:36.292
<i>we'll start the attack in three minutes.</i>

04:37.375 --> 04:39.166
Captain.

04:39.167 --> 04:42.416
We'll report in two minutes. Over.

04:42.417 --> 04:43.541
Dong Li.

04:43.542 --> 04:45.874
What's our opening like?

04:45.875 --> 04:47.999
The ship is rolling,
the direction is unsteady.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.041
Headwinds at 45-55.

04:50.042 --> 04:51.749
<i>For a reliable line of fire,</i>

04:51.750 --> 04:54.666
<i>we need to be within 120 to 150 meters.</i>

04:54.667 --> 04:56.041
<i>At 23 knots,</i>

04:56.042 --> 04:57.249
<i>we'll have an optimal position</i>

04:57.250 --> 04:58.666
for only three seconds,

04:58.667 --> 05:00.041
or we have a risk of collision.

05:00.042 --> 05:02.375
<i>Seabird One, all clear?</i>

05:03.375 --> 05:04.457
All clear.

05:04.458 --> 05:05.457
Captain.

05:05.458 --> 05:07.166
We'll attack in ten seconds.

05:07.167 --> 05:08.166
Over.

05:08.167 --> 05:09.125
Standby.

05:13.750 --> 05:15.125
Attack!

05:24.458 --> 05:25.374
There is no changes.

05:25.375 --> 05:26.291
Northwest wind.

05:26.292 --> 05:27.416
The velocity is 20.8.

05:27.417 --> 05:28.499
The time is three seconds.

05:28.500 --> 05:29.999
<i>Data steady.</i>

05:30.000 --> 05:31.624
<i>Steady.</i>

05:31.625 --> 05:33.332
<i>Steady.</i>

05:33.333 --> 05:34.208
<i>Steady.</i>

06:30.417 --> 06:32.249
Down! Everyone down!

06:32.250 --> 06:34.207
<i>Captain, the hostages are safe,</i>

06:34.208 --> 06:36.791
<i>but we can't stop the ship.</i>

06:36.792 --> 06:38.499
Reporting. If the ship still doesn't stop,

06:38.500 --> 06:40.249
we'll have to abandon the ship
in five minutes.

06:40.250 --> 06:41.958
Hong Xu, report your situation.

06:46.083 --> 06:47.207
They have the generator.

06:47.208 --> 06:48.541
We're running out of time.

06:48.542 --> 06:52.042
We need to storm in
and blow up the hydraulics.

06:53.208 --> 06:54.416
<i>If the ship doesn't stop,</i>

06:54.417 --> 06:56.375
<i>everyone must leave the ship
in five minutes.</i>

06:57.375 --> 06:58.458
Give me the shield!

07:01.875 --> 07:03.791
You two stay here.

07:03.792 --> 07:04.749
Shitou,

07:04.750 --> 07:05.750
come with me!

07:18.500 --> 07:20.125
Up there. One.

07:41.333 --> 07:44.208
Ready to blow up the hydraulics!

07:59.000 --> 08:02.208
<i>Captain, the hostage-taker
is escaping on a boat!</i>

08:14.125 --> 08:15.249
Captain!

08:15.250 --> 08:16.541
I'll chase him.

08:16.542 --> 08:17.541
No, Xing Luo!

08:17.542 --> 08:18.916
There are too many of them.

08:18.917 --> 08:20.416
It's too dangerous!

08:20.417 --> 08:22.792
We can't let him go!

08:27.958 --> 08:28.874
All right.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.166
Permission granted,

08:30.167 --> 08:31.166
but be careful.

08:31.167 --> 08:33.332
Don't cross into territorial waters.

08:33.332 --> 08:37.082
I promise I'll get him
before we cross into territorial waters.

08:44.458 --> 08:45.791
Jiaolong Unit Two.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.083
Board the ship and arrest them!

09:01.292 --> 09:02.374
Captain, Commissar.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.208
Three pirate boats are approaching!

09:09.792 --> 09:10.749
<i>Xing Luo.</i>

09:10.750 --> 09:13.500
<i>We must maintain
a 300-meters safe distance.</i>

09:25.708 --> 09:27.291
Seabird One!

09:27.292 --> 09:28.457
You can't go any further.

09:28.458 --> 09:29.707
Stop now!

09:29.708 --> 09:31.457
<i>Roger.</i>

09:31.458 --> 09:33.041
Give me one more chance!

09:33.042 --> 09:34.583
Pull up the plane!

09:44.958 --> 09:45.874
<i>Dong Li.</i>

09:45.875 --> 09:47.417
<i>You should handle the others!</i>

09:54.375 --> 09:55.667
<i>Steady!</i>

10:10.917 --> 10:11.874
<i>Sea One and Two.</i>

10:11.875 --> 10:13.041
<i>The target has stopped.</i>

10:13.042 --> 10:15.499
<i>Arrest them, I'll cover you!</i>

10:15.500 --> 10:16.750
<i>Sea One and Two copy that!</i>

10:25.500 --> 10:26.333
I got it!

10:43.542 --> 10:44.832
Xing Luo!

10:44.833 --> 10:45.832
<i>Man down!</i>

10:45.833 --> 10:47.291
<i>Repeating. Man down!</i>

10:47.292 --> 10:48.749
Who? Who was shot?

10:48.750 --> 10:50.375
<i>Xing Luo. It's Xing Luo.</i>

10:53.583 --> 10:54.791
<i>Captain, Commissar.</i>

10:54.792 --> 10:56.333
<i>The pirates are in custody.</i>

12:16.958 --> 12:18.291
Xing Luo is safe.

12:18.292 --> 12:19.625
His condition is stable.

12:21.958 --> 12:23.416
But

12:23.417 --> 12:25.667
he has to stay in Djibouti
to get treatment.

12:27.375 --> 12:28.749
Don't worry.

12:28.750 --> 12:29.792
Get some rest.

12:47.250 --> 12:48.125
Captain.

12:50.125 --> 12:51.874
Have you told them?

12:51.875 --> 12:52.792
Yes.

12:55.000 --> 12:55.917
Except that

12:57.292 --> 12:59.874
it pierced his spinal nerve.

12:59.875 --> 13:01.000
I didn't tell them that.

13:08.542 --> 13:10.582
Rui.

13:10.583 --> 13:12.041
Have you heard this?

13:12.042 --> 13:14.374
A soldier should know about sacrifice.

13:14.375 --> 13:16.500
And that he may never return.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.667
They should understand the soldiers' duty.

13:24.417 --> 13:26.958
You can tell them the truth.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.542
You're the captain, not their parent.

13:33.333 --> 13:37.832
Don't take all of this personally

13:37.833 --> 13:39.832
or the stress will kill you.

13:39.833 --> 13:42.417
I can't help it. It's my responsibility.

13:45.875 --> 13:49.000
ONE WEEK LATER

14:01.083 --> 14:02.083
Bye-bye.

14:05.083 --> 14:08.541
This is our target. William Parsons.

14:08.542 --> 14:11.750
He is the head of development
at an energy company in Yewaire.

14:12.792 --> 14:15.832
His department works on
the mining of uranium

14:15.833 --> 14:18.916
and obtaining yellowcake
in foreign countries.

14:18.917 --> 14:22.750
That's why we couldn't figure out
where the yellowcake came from.

14:24.625 --> 14:26.832
October, 2014.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.666
The month he was investigated.

14:28.667 --> 14:31.707
That was the same time
the unmarked yellowcake was smuggled in.

14:31.708 --> 14:32.999
Exactly.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.749
My guy says that William still has access
to an abundant amount of yellowcake.

14:38.750 --> 14:42.958
And he has just acquired the technology
to make 30 bombs.

14:47.375 --> 14:49.332
The situation in Yewaire is tense.

14:49.333 --> 14:51.332
If that yellowcake is still there,

14:51.333 --> 14:54.166
he wants to finish the deal
and get rid of it.

14:54.167 --> 14:56.291
We must follow this lead.

14:56.292 --> 14:58.374
There is another report on William

14:58.375 --> 15:02.166
about a sexual abuse case of a young girl.

15:02.167 --> 15:05.207
Okay? And all evidence points to him.

15:05.208 --> 15:07.624
My guy talked to the girl and she said

15:07.625 --> 15:10.499
William never took off his necklace

15:10.500 --> 15:13.041
because he said it contains a secret

15:13.042 --> 15:15.958
that would turn the world into chaos.

15:21.792 --> 15:22.957
I've got it.

15:22.958 --> 15:24.041
I'm going straight there.

15:24.042 --> 15:25.207
And tomorrow morning,

15:25.208 --> 15:27.416
Abu will publish a full-page report.

15:27.417 --> 15:29.624
Let's do something to sabotage their plan.

15:29.625 --> 15:30.958
Don't take this any further.

15:31.958 --> 15:33.624
You already know

15:33.625 --> 15:35.082
the terrorists are onto you.

15:35.083 --> 15:36.083
So what?

15:37.958 --> 15:39.792
It's not about scaring you,

15:40.833 --> 15:42.875
nor it is about you being scared.

15:45.875 --> 15:48.124
Albert, you know better than anyone

15:48.125 --> 15:50.124
why I left those big newspapers.

15:50.125 --> 15:52.582
It's because they always do
selective reporting

15:52.583 --> 15:54.457
and covered up the truth!

15:54.458 --> 15:56.666
- When you hired me, you said--
- No!

15:56.667 --> 15:58.874
- I have the guts to go expose the truth.
- No!

15:58.875 --> 16:00.083
- That's why I'm here!
- No!

16:01.625 --> 16:03.957
I appreciate your tenacity,

16:03.958 --> 16:06.207
but there are limits.

16:06.208 --> 16:09.333
Did you forget what you stand for?

16:50.625 --> 16:52.749
<i>I definitely won't risk</i>

16:52.750 --> 16:54.417
the lives of my staff!

16:59.708 --> 17:01.875
But there are things that are
more important than life.

17:10.708 --> 17:12.499
At 0300 hours this morning,

17:12.500 --> 17:16.082
the Foreign Ministry sent
an urgent message.

17:16.083 --> 17:18.957
Five days ago,
there was a coup in Yewaire.

17:18.958 --> 17:20.582
By order of
the Central Military Commission,

17:20.583 --> 17:21.957
the Naval Command appoints us

17:21.958 --> 17:24.624
to head to Yewaire immediately

17:24.625 --> 17:26.541
and evacuate all Chinese citizens.

17:30.167 --> 17:33.874
It has been five days since the civil war
broke out in the Republic of Ihwea.

17:33.875 --> 17:36.374
And the insurgence played
by General Sharaf

17:36.375 --> 17:39.249
have already seized
the Republic's major cities.

17:39.250 --> 17:42.624
Our footage shows that large
groups of citizens and expats

17:42.625 --> 17:44.749
are fleeing the war zone.

17:44.750 --> 17:48.832
In addition, sources claim
that many people were missing

17:48.833 --> 17:50.749
or abducted during the civil war

17:50.750 --> 17:53.624
including expats and high-level officials

17:53.625 --> 17:55.666
of the Ihwea government.

17:55.667 --> 17:57.374
And is is expected to be

17:57.375 --> 18:00.333
an act by the country's
extremist group Zaka.

18:01.333 --> 18:05.249
This group, Zaka,
has been spreading terrorism

18:05.250 --> 18:07.666
in the bid for recognition.

18:07.667 --> 18:08.666
For the past two years,

18:08.667 --> 18:11.541
<i>they joined other extremist groups</i>

18:11.542 --> 18:14.082
across Europe and Asia
and get into action.

18:14.083 --> 18:16.124
During this coup,

18:16.125 --> 18:17.749
Zaka has supported

18:17.750 --> 18:20.416
General Sharaf who also known as Madman.

18:20.417 --> 18:22.707
<i>According to the list given by
the Foreign Ministry,</i>

18:22.708 --> 18:27.166
<i>we need to evacuate
a total of 130 Chinese citizens</i>

18:27.167 --> 18:30.582
<i>and 30 foreign staff of Chinese companies.</i>

18:30.583 --> 18:33.457
<i>Linyi is to sail for Yewaire.</i>

18:33.458 --> 18:35.458
<i>The other ships will return home.</i>

19:05.208 --> 19:06.833
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

19:11.375 --> 19:12.375
Let's go.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.041
<i>Listen up!</i>

19:15.042 --> 19:16.957
<i>For this mission,</i>

19:16.958 --> 19:19.499
<i>we'll break into small teams.</i>

19:19.500 --> 19:21.416
<i>We can't carry much ammunition.</i>

19:21.417 --> 19:23.666
<i>The local army</i>

19:23.667 --> 19:25.416
<i>will supply materials.</i>

19:25.417 --> 19:27.707
<i>But their weapons and calibers</i>

19:27.708 --> 19:29.249
<i>are different from ours.</i>

19:29.250 --> 19:31.499
<i>So we'll be using defensive weapons</i>

19:31.500 --> 19:33.167
<i>from the EU.</i>

19:48.625 --> 19:49.583
Did you touch my candy?

20:04.583 --> 20:06.999
So they've sent us Shun Gu.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.582
I heard he's pretty arrogant.

20:08.583 --> 20:10.000
See for yourself.

20:15.625 --> 20:16.707
Captain!

20:16.708 --> 20:18.417
Sniper Shun Gu is reporting.

20:20.792 --> 20:21.916
Welcome.

20:21.917 --> 20:23.541
- Dong Li!
- Present!

20:23.542 --> 20:24.417
Come here.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.792
Meet Xing Luo's replacement.

20:29.667 --> 20:30.666
I'm the spotter, Dong Li.

20:30.667 --> 20:32.624
I'm Shun Gu.

20:32.625 --> 20:33.582
Captain.

20:33.583 --> 20:34.666
We have a special mission.

20:34.667 --> 20:35.874
They need us now.

20:35.875 --> 20:38.499
Right.
You should introduce him to the rest.

20:38.500 --> 20:39.375
Yes, sir!

20:45.833 --> 20:47.291
If you were Xing Luo's spotter,

20:47.292 --> 20:48.957
you must know your stuff.

20:48.958 --> 20:49.957
I look forward

20:49.958 --> 20:51.167
to seeing that.

20:52.750 --> 20:54.583
The feeling is mutual.

20:55.792 --> 20:57.292
You'll have your chance.

21:05.583 --> 21:09.207
Listen, when the troop comes to take
Dr. William and the others,

21:09.208 --> 21:12.582
I'll stop them and you will
take care of the rest.

21:12.583 --> 21:14.416
You got it?

21:14.417 --> 21:15.832
You got it?

21:15.833 --> 21:18.333
Yeah, yes. I got it. Relax.

21:19.583 --> 21:21.082
<i>Stop pushing me, Doctor.</i>

21:21.083 --> 21:23.874
<i>Look at the news.
The military is everywhere.</i>

21:23.875 --> 21:25.457
<i>And the chaos, it is everywhere.</i>

21:25.458 --> 21:27.832
I'm not in the mood to hear any excuses.

21:27.833 --> 21:30.458
You took the money,
now the job is to have it done.

21:31.833 --> 21:34.041
You promised me one week.

21:34.042 --> 21:36.208
So the shipment must be on the plane.

21:37.292 --> 21:39.917
If it's not, I'm not the only one
who's going to be in trouble.

21:41.375 --> 21:42.916
You are the General.

21:42.917 --> 21:45.625
And I'm sure that you can handle
this situation.

22:07.042 --> 22:10.167
<i>Consul He, the third group
has reached the port.</i>

22:15.292 --> 22:16.832
<i>Dr. Lu.</i>

22:16.833 --> 22:17.791
<i>Consul He.</i>

22:17.792 --> 22:18.833
Hello.

22:20.625 --> 22:21.582
Where's your wife?

22:21.583 --> 22:23.874
Her company is doing the evacuation.

22:23.875 --> 22:25.416
How is it going over there?

22:25.417 --> 22:26.332
You can't even imagine.

22:26.333 --> 22:27.707
I rushed here in panic,

22:27.708 --> 22:29.082
I don't even know where my phone is.

22:29.083 --> 22:30.708
- Call her now.
- Thank you.

22:32.167 --> 22:33.166
<i>Hello?</i>

22:33.167 --> 22:35.457
<i>- Mei?</i>
- Why didn't you pick up?

22:35.458 --> 22:36.582
I was so worried!

22:36.583 --> 22:39.041
<i>Don't worry, we're at the consulate.</i>

22:39.042 --> 22:39.957
How is it over there?

22:39.958 --> 22:41.124
<i>Are you there with Xuan-xuan?</i>

22:41.125 --> 22:42.249
Yes, don't worry.

22:42.250 --> 22:44.291
- Let me talk to her.
<i>- Make sure Xuan-xuan is with you.</i>

22:44.292 --> 22:46.166
- Consul He wants a word.
- Mei Deng?

22:46.167 --> 22:47.207
It's Qing-liu He.

22:47.208 --> 22:48.499
<i>What's your plan over there?</i>

22:48.500 --> 22:49.916
Hello, Consul He.

22:49.917 --> 22:52.582
Government troops are coming

22:52.583 --> 22:53.791
to coordinate our evacuation.

22:53.792 --> 22:56.041
<i>Remember to keep in touch.</i>

22:56.042 --> 22:56.957
I know.

22:56.958 --> 22:58.416
I'll call as soon as the troops arrive.

22:58.417 --> 23:02.374
The situation could change so fast,
and that's not under my control or yours.

23:02.375 --> 23:06.499
Yes, I'm using all of my resources
to settle this issue.

23:06.500 --> 23:07.875
You have to trust me.

23:15.208 --> 23:16.124
<i>Captain, Commissar.</i>

23:16.125 --> 23:18.208
<i>We have permission to enter the port!</i>

23:19.542 --> 23:22.083
- Battle-ready deployment grade two!
- Yes, sir!

23:36.625 --> 23:37.999
That's our warship!

23:38.000 --> 23:38.958
It's here!

24:09.875 --> 24:11.000
Captain.

24:12.625 --> 24:14.041
We have a new situation in Yewaire.

24:14.042 --> 24:15.999
There is an assassination attempt
on the President.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.666
The Chief Secretary Mohadi
has taken charge for now.

24:18.667 --> 24:22.082
Their government is asking us

24:22.083 --> 24:24.832
to take his family to safety.

24:24.833 --> 24:26.541
Our superior has agreed

24:26.542 --> 24:28.167
and given Linyi this duty.

24:29.750 --> 24:31.249
Understood.

24:31.250 --> 24:32.708
I'll check the security.

24:35.042 --> 24:36.207
<i>Consul!</i>

24:36.208 --> 24:37.416
We've got everyone.

24:37.417 --> 24:39.207
- How about the escort?
- They're here.

24:39.208 --> 24:40.791
We'll leave straight away.

24:40.792 --> 24:41.916
- Go tell them!
- Okay.

24:41.917 --> 24:43.249
Get your bags quickly.

24:43.250 --> 24:44.541
We're leaving now!

24:44.542 --> 24:45.375
Quick!

24:56.417 --> 24:59.957
The Chinese consul has left.

24:59.958 --> 25:02.542
Let's go!
Let's force them into the war zone!

25:25.333 --> 25:26.458
Hey, get down.

25:33.958 --> 25:35.917
Shit, it's Zaka.

25:44.792 --> 25:47.707
Zaka is coming! They've killed the guards!

25:47.708 --> 25:49.250
Run! Hide yourselves!

26:05.250 --> 26:06.250
Just push through!

26:07.542 --> 26:09.749
Inform the army vehicle at the back
to overtake

26:09.750 --> 26:11.750
and let the consul's vehicle
follow their back.

26:14.250 --> 26:17.167
The convoy is in the war zone.

26:23.875 --> 26:25.457
Reverse! Quick!

26:25.458 --> 26:26.542
Hurry, reverse!

26:30.625 --> 26:32.083
There are rebels behind us.

26:34.583 --> 26:35.792
Contact the warship now!

26:36.833 --> 26:37.917
Set up a defensive line!

26:48.750 --> 26:50.417
Stay there, get down!

26:57.333 --> 26:58.499
Don't let them trap us!

26:58.500 --> 26:59.957
We need to hide, quick!

26:59.958 --> 27:02.457
Everyone, get down from the car now!

27:02.458 --> 27:04.375
- Hurry!
- Don't panic, one at a time!

27:05.417 --> 27:06.333
Hurry!

27:10.250 --> 27:12.249
Quick, quick!

27:12.250 --> 27:14.332
Take the consul!

27:14.333 --> 27:15.625
Consul, hurry!

27:19.917 --> 27:22.792
The consul and others went into a factory.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.167
Captain.

27:41.375 --> 27:42.291
Rui Yang speaking.

27:42.292 --> 27:45.291
<i>Consul Qing-liu He just sent an SOS.</i>

27:45.292 --> 27:48.332
<i>His convoy was ambushed.</i>

27:48.333 --> 27:51.249
<i>Yewaire can't spare any troops,</i>

27:51.250 --> 27:53.832
<i>but we have their permission to go in.</i>

27:53.833 --> 27:56.083
<i>They'll clear the roads out of the port.</i>

28:46.042 --> 28:47.332
Listen up, everyone.

28:47.333 --> 28:49.624
<i>We can't get to the factory by road,</i>

28:49.625 --> 28:52.416
<i>so we'll go over the roofs.</i>

28:52.417 --> 28:54.249
<i>Unit One, Shun Gu, Dong Li.</i>

28:54.250 --> 28:56.124
<i>Your duty is to establish an overwatch.</i>

28:56.125 --> 28:57.916
<i>The rest are on search and rescue.</i>

28:57.917 --> 29:00.666
<i>Unit Two, send three people
to help the military police.</i>

29:00.667 --> 29:01.957
<i>The rest will guard the convoy.</i>

29:01.958 --> 29:02.917
Over.

29:17.583 --> 29:19.457
<i>What? We lost the Fifth Road?</i>

29:19.458 --> 29:21.832
<i>No, don't go by Lafayette.</i>

29:21.833 --> 29:25.292
<i>There are no escape routes. Try Zima Road.</i>

30:06.375 --> 30:08.207
<i>Did you find Dr. William?</i>

30:08.208 --> 30:09.582
Not yet.

30:09.583 --> 30:12.458
<i>Find him! He's the key.</i>

31:10.417 --> 31:11.708
Move it!

31:25.542 --> 31:28.042
One minute before our target.
Grab your guns!

31:42.542 --> 31:43.542
<i>Support the military police.</i>

31:49.292 --> 31:51.332
We are under fire.
Permission to return fire!

31:51.333 --> 31:52.250
<i>Granted.</i>

31:57.500 --> 31:59.208
Base, we've arrived at the target.

32:02.042 --> 32:03.750
<i>Unit Two, defend the convoy!</i>

32:13.958 --> 32:15.250
Smoke bomb!

32:25.958 --> 32:28.250
<i>Flanks, set up a defensive line!</i>

32:53.917 --> 32:55.667
Base, we're on the roof.

32:59.750 --> 33:00.667
All clear.

33:01.917 --> 33:03.750
Shun Gu, Dong Li, find an overwatch.

33:25.417 --> 33:26.500
Approaching overwatch.

33:52.042 --> 33:54.167
Base, we're on the factory roof.

33:57.250 --> 33:58.250
Unit One is in!

34:00.333 --> 34:03.082
If you stop, the kids will die!

34:03.083 --> 34:05.166
Crash into them!

34:05.167 --> 34:08.081
Or I'll blow their brains out!

34:08.083 --> 34:10.748
Do you think I'm kidding?

34:10.750 --> 34:13.248
See this? If you stop, they will be dead.

34:13.250 --> 34:16.041
Go on, blow them up!

34:16.042 --> 34:17.250
I understand!

34:23.000 --> 34:24.083
Sniper in position.

34:40.250 --> 34:42.417
It's a car bomb! Stop it!

34:48.917 --> 34:51.000
Everyone, take cover!

34:57.292 --> 34:58.792
What was that explosion?

35:00.625 --> 35:02.374
<i>There is a car bomb at the checkpoint.</i>

35:02.375 --> 35:03.875
<i>Heavy casualties for government troops.</i>

35:06.750 --> 35:08.332
<i>Unit Two, step it up!</i>

35:08.333 --> 35:09.417
<i>Hold the evacuation point!</i>

35:35.292 --> 35:36.792
What's wrong? Do you need the inhaler?

35:52.500 --> 35:55.333
- Hurry up!
- This is the fastest I can go.

36:14.542 --> 36:16.458
Block all exits!

36:17.625 --> 36:19.083
Find those Chinese people!

37:41.667 --> 37:43.125
Got them. Move!

37:46.000 --> 37:46.916
Who's there?

37:46.917 --> 37:48.166
Chinese military police!

37:48.167 --> 37:49.792
- Chen Lu, check his wounds.
- Yes, sir!

37:55.000 --> 37:56.624
Chinese Navy.

37:56.625 --> 37:59.082
- We'll take you home.
- An-zi, can you hear me?

37:59.083 --> 38:01.166
- I'm Consul Qing-liu He.
<i>- Yes, I'm here.</i>

38:01.167 --> 38:03.375
- Where are you?
<i>- We are trapped in the workshop!</i>

38:05.125 --> 38:07.374
Hong Xu, Yu Zhuang, Tian-de Zhang.
Evacuate the citizens.

38:07.375 --> 38:08.542
Everyone else, come with me.

38:34.917 --> 38:35.875
Grenade!

38:41.875 --> 38:43.625
There are two in the room
and one is outside!

38:54.417 --> 38:55.708
Li Tong! Let them taste hell!

39:04.958 --> 39:06.083
One down!

39:10.833 --> 39:12.375
Watch out! Bazooka!

39:21.542 --> 39:22.625
Move!

39:26.375 --> 39:28.666
- Hold on!
- Yu Zhuang, move out!

39:28.667 --> 39:29.666
Go!

39:29.667 --> 39:30.500
Shitou!

39:32.958 --> 39:34.291
Come on, go!

39:34.292 --> 39:36.291
<i>Evacuation point! We're on the way!</i>

39:36.292 --> 39:37.999
<i>Be ready!</i>

39:38.000 --> 39:39.417
<i>Everyone, covering fire!</i>

39:42.875 --> 39:45.124
Unit One is going through!

39:45.125 --> 39:47.917
Quick, stay low!

39:55.292 --> 39:58.333
Watch out, it is suspected that
there is a car bomb at 12 o'clock!

40:01.708 --> 40:03.624
Quick, get in!

40:03.625 --> 40:06.167
<i>Unit One! Hurry! There is a car bomb!</i>

40:12.833 --> 40:14.417
Stop the car!

40:22.042 --> 40:24.124
Don't kill me! Don't shoot!

40:24.125 --> 40:26.499
I'm not with them! They forced me!

40:26.500 --> 40:28.708
He's not with Zaka! Lower your weapons!

40:30.458 --> 40:31.957
What's wrong?

40:31.958 --> 40:35.458
Those terrorists.
They've been bombing civilians.

40:36.958 --> 40:38.082
I'll handle it.

40:38.083 --> 40:39.374
Tell your men to stay calm.

40:39.375 --> 40:42.041
Shitou! Take my position.

40:42.042 --> 40:43.374
Sniper's hide.

40:43.375 --> 40:44.374
I read you.

40:44.375 --> 40:46.917
<i>- Cover me. I'm going to that car.</i>
- Roger.

41:06.542 --> 41:08.958
Relax, it's okay. It's okay.

41:22.417 --> 41:23.292
Don't move.

42:18.958 --> 42:21.958
American, please. Save my kid.

42:23.958 --> 42:26.416
My kid, please.

42:26.417 --> 42:28.416
Let's go.

42:28.417 --> 42:29.624
Please.

42:29.625 --> 42:30.917
We're coming out!

42:35.208 --> 42:36.500
Tian-de Zhang, move out!

42:38.917 --> 42:41.041
Quick, move out!

42:41.042 --> 42:43.291
Sniper's hide! Move out!

42:43.292 --> 42:44.708
Roger! Moving out!

43:48.542 --> 43:50.667
Abu, are you okay?

43:52.333 --> 43:53.957
I...

43:53.958 --> 43:55.875
I will get his necklace first.

45:03.667 --> 45:05.541
<i>We just received news
from The Foreign Ministry.</i>

45:05.542 --> 45:07.041
A French-Chinese reporter

45:07.042 --> 45:08.707
called Nan Xia

45:08.708 --> 45:11.374
contacted their 12308 hotline.

45:11.375 --> 45:14.041
<i>She said she saw Zaka</i>

45:14.042 --> 45:16.874
kidnapping the staff of an energy company,

45:16.875 --> 45:19.707
including a Chinese citizen, Mei Deng.

45:19.708 --> 45:21.582
Is that reliable info?

45:21.583 --> 45:23.999
We made contact with Nan Xia

45:24.000 --> 45:25.707
and confirmed her identity.

45:25.708 --> 45:28.166
The Yewaire government will help.

45:28.167 --> 45:30.124
<i>They'll supply ground and air support</i>

45:30.125 --> 45:31.999
<i>for the joint rescue mission.</i>

45:32.000 --> 45:33.832
<i>Our mission this time</i>

45:33.833 --> 45:35.916
<i>is to give a message to all terrorists</i>

45:35.917 --> 45:38.041
<i>that you can never harm a Chinese citizen.</i>

45:38.042 --> 45:39.041
<i>Unit Two,</i>

45:39.042 --> 45:41.166
<i>take the citizens to the port.</i>

45:41.167 --> 45:42.207
<i>Unit One,</i>

45:42.208 --> 45:45.582
<i>go with their government troops
and wait for orders.</i>

45:45.583 --> 45:47.999
<i>We'll send in the materials, supplies,</i>

45:48.000 --> 45:49.875
<i>- and wingsuits.</i>
- Yes, sir!

45:55.292 --> 45:58.082
When he asked me to save his kids,

45:58.083 --> 45:59.583
I felt awful.

46:00.708 --> 46:01.667
We saved their lives,

46:02.917 --> 46:03.917
but not their homes.

46:05.500 --> 46:07.541
This country of theirs

46:07.542 --> 46:08.917
is in such a mess.

46:10.292 --> 46:13.332
At most, we complete our mission

46:13.333 --> 46:14.750
and that's it.

46:19.375 --> 46:20.958
Why do you like candy so much?

46:21.958 --> 46:24.624
You still don't know after all this time?

46:24.625 --> 46:26.082
I was a naughty kid.

46:26.083 --> 46:27.249
I always got spanked.

46:27.250 --> 46:28.457
But each time,

46:28.458 --> 46:30.041
my mom gave me a candy.

46:30.042 --> 46:31.291
So even now,

46:31.292 --> 46:32.207
when I'm on a mission,

46:32.208 --> 46:33.166
if I have candy,

46:33.167 --> 46:34.375
I can handle anything.

46:37.792 --> 46:39.791
What was that for?

46:39.792 --> 46:40.957
Didn't you say

46:40.958 --> 46:42.792
if you have candy, there is no pain?

46:51.042 --> 46:54.166
Do you know Xing Luo and I were rivals?

46:54.167 --> 46:56.041
Yes.

46:56.042 --> 46:58.166
You guys were fighting for a spot
in a sniper training camp

46:58.167 --> 47:01.124
at a commando school in Venezuela.

47:01.125 --> 47:02.958
There's only one spot for Jiaolong.

47:04.750 --> 47:06.207
It's a pity.

47:06.208 --> 47:07.583
There is no chance to compete now.

47:08.625 --> 47:10.667
He was the best sniper I ever saw.

47:13.292 --> 47:14.708
Were you always like this?

47:16.042 --> 47:17.041
Like what?

47:17.042 --> 47:18.416
Tense.

47:18.417 --> 47:19.833
Shaky under pressure.

47:23.250 --> 47:24.582
On the battlefield,

47:24.583 --> 47:26.374
you can't dodge bullets.

47:26.375 --> 47:29.332
Take this as a free lesson for you.

47:29.333 --> 47:30.917
Next time, I'll ask for fees.

47:35.417 --> 47:37.333
Captain, we received news.

47:38.333 --> 47:41.082
Yewaire can't spare any choppers.

47:41.083 --> 47:42.791
We'll have to escort the convoy

47:42.792 --> 47:44.750
of civilian evacuees by road.

47:46.292 --> 47:47.624
If we go by road,

47:47.625 --> 47:49.999
it'll take twice as long.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.917
I worry they won't get back in time.

47:55.167 --> 47:56.499
Get me Jiaolong Unit One.

47:56.500 --> 47:57.333
Yes, sir!

47:58.542 --> 47:59.707
Nan Xia's phone

47:59.708 --> 48:02.374
was last found in the Northeast.

48:02.375 --> 48:04.832
According to the Yewaire authorities,

48:04.833 --> 48:07.499
there's a town there called Basem.

48:07.500 --> 48:08.791
Zaka took over it

48:08.792 --> 48:10.416
<i>a week ago.</i>

48:10.417 --> 48:13.874
<i>Go to the Yewaire Army Meeting Point.</i>

48:13.875 --> 48:15.916
<i>Follow the evacuation convoy.</i>

48:15.917 --> 48:18.249
Their commandos will work with you

48:18.250 --> 48:19.249
<i>to rescue Mei Deng.</i>

48:19.250 --> 48:20.332
Roger.

48:20.333 --> 48:22.374
The operation is confirmed.

48:22.375 --> 48:24.292
But we only have three hours.

48:25.792 --> 48:27.582
We'll be deep in enemy territory.

48:27.583 --> 48:31.416
But we don't have
any reliable Intel until now.

48:31.417 --> 48:33.083
Only one thing is certain.

48:34.917 --> 48:36.167
It will be a tough battle.

48:39.333 --> 48:40.958
I want each of you

48:42.292 --> 48:43.667
to give it your all

48:45.375 --> 48:46.542
and return safely.

48:48.542 --> 48:49.749
Do you understand?

48:49.750 --> 48:50.749
Yes, sir!

48:50.750 --> 48:51.667
Move now!

49:10.458 --> 49:11.957
Sayyid.

49:11.958 --> 49:13.832
The Chief Secretary's wife is at the port.

49:13.833 --> 49:16.667
The Chinese hostage
is our bargaining chip.

49:17.792 --> 49:20.416
But they won't give in easily.

49:20.417 --> 49:22.917
<i>Stay there and observe everything.</i>

49:24.542 --> 49:26.207
There are three trucks on the hill.

49:26.208 --> 49:27.457
Two are armed.

49:27.458 --> 49:29.082
I'm not sure about the third.

49:29.083 --> 49:30.917
- When did they appear?
- Three minutes ago.

49:49.083 --> 49:50.791
Prepare the auxiliary gun.

49:50.792 --> 49:51.792
Yes, sir!

50:21.167 --> 50:22.125
Thank you.

50:28.500 --> 50:31.166
I understand. But I have to go to Basem.

50:31.167 --> 50:32.624
It's not just to save my assistant.

50:32.625 --> 50:34.291
There's something very important

50:34.292 --> 50:36.249
I have to do there.

50:36.250 --> 50:37.874
I'm sorry, Ms. Xia.

50:37.875 --> 50:40.041
We can't take you with us.

50:40.042 --> 50:42.499
We don't know the situation there. Right?

50:42.500 --> 50:45.124
Captain Yang,
can you let me explain first?

50:45.125 --> 50:46.374
Okay.

50:46.375 --> 50:49.999
Hong Xu, get them moving. Quick.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.082
It's about the black-market yellowcake.

50:53.083 --> 50:54.999
Zaka has William Parsons,

50:55.000 --> 50:56.374
the biggest dealer in the market.

50:56.375 --> 50:57.374
We found out

50:57.375 --> 50:59.291
that he's in touch with terrorist groups.

50:59.292 --> 51:00.332
One of them

51:00.333 --> 51:02.166
now has the technology

51:02.167 --> 51:04.999
for large-scale dirty bombs.

51:05.000 --> 51:05.957
Which means

51:05.958 --> 51:07.624
once they get the yellowcake,

51:07.625 --> 51:10.541
who knows how many they will kill?

51:10.542 --> 51:11.749
Are you talking about Zaka?

51:11.750 --> 51:13.791
Yes, all they want is the yellowcake.

51:13.792 --> 51:15.749
- It's not our business.
- I hope you can save Abu,

51:15.750 --> 51:18.083
- Our mission--
- William and all of them!

51:19.875 --> 51:21.541
Ms. Xia, our mission

51:21.542 --> 51:23.207
is to rescue a Chinese hostage.

51:23.208 --> 51:24.374
If we can,

51:24.375 --> 51:25.666
we'll rescue the others.

51:25.667 --> 51:26.582
But I'm sorry,

51:26.583 --> 51:28.499
you can't come with us.

51:28.500 --> 51:29.582
If I don't go with you,

51:29.583 --> 51:31.250
I'll never get what I came for!

51:32.500 --> 51:33.458
Please get in the car.

51:34.875 --> 51:36.249
Sorry, you can't leave.

51:36.250 --> 51:37.624
Why not?

51:37.625 --> 51:38.791
I already told you.

51:38.792 --> 51:40.207
We were ordered

51:40.208 --> 51:42.457
to take you to an army base.

51:42.458 --> 51:44.291
You'll be evacuated from there.

51:44.292 --> 51:45.207
Sir, this is Nan Xia.

51:45.208 --> 51:46.457
- We have a situation.
- Ms. Xia.

51:46.458 --> 51:47.957
In the next terrorist attack,

51:47.958 --> 51:50.708
countless people will die
because of William's yellowcake.

52:00.417 --> 52:01.707
What is it?

52:01.708 --> 52:03.374
Zaka put out a video

52:03.375 --> 52:05.082
addressed to the Chinese Navy.

52:05.083 --> 52:05.958
Look.

52:08.833 --> 52:10.624
<i>Chief Secretary Muhadi is a sinner</i>

52:10.625 --> 52:14.957
<i>who continues to suppress my people
with his abuse of violence.</i>

52:14.958 --> 52:19.749
<i>We demand that you stop harboring
the sinner and turn over Muhadi's family.</i>

52:19.750 --> 52:21.916
<i>We must avenge the brothers and sisters</i>

52:21.917 --> 52:24.541
<i>who sacrificed because of Muhad.</i>

52:24.542 --> 52:26.041
<i>If you refuse to cooperate,</i>

52:26.042 --> 52:29.957
<i>the Chinese citizens shall take
the punishment in their place.</i>

52:29.958 --> 52:31.542
<i>This is just an example.</i>

52:35.583 --> 52:38.167
<i>And this Chinese woman will be next.</i>

52:44.208 --> 52:46.541
Damn it!

52:46.542 --> 52:48.916
Savages!

52:48.917 --> 52:51.374
Our only hope

52:51.375 --> 52:54.125
is for Jiaolong to rescue them all.

54:03.375 --> 54:04.624
- Captain Yang.
- Yes?

54:04.625 --> 54:07.166
We just got word about
possible danger ahead.

54:07.167 --> 54:08.624
We have to look for a different route.

54:08.625 --> 54:09.958
What?

54:13.333 --> 54:14.791
Yu Zhuang, contact the base.

54:14.792 --> 54:16.166
- Okay.
- Hurry!

54:16.167 --> 54:18.125
Base, this is Unit One.

54:19.750 --> 54:20.917
Do you read me?

54:23.833 --> 54:26.041
Base, this is Unit One.

54:26.042 --> 54:27.542
Request for signal. Over.

54:31.500 --> 54:32.542
Base.

54:37.833 --> 54:39.583
Mortar attack!

55:00.333 --> 55:02.791
Is everyone okay? Answer me!

55:02.792 --> 55:04.249
I'm okay!

55:04.250 --> 55:05.707
- Chen Lu's okay!
- Hong Xu's okay!

55:05.708 --> 55:06.916
Shun Gu, Dong Li, okay!

55:06.917 --> 55:08.250
Tian-de Zhang and Li Tong, okay!

55:25.292 --> 55:26.458
Don't move!

55:27.500 --> 55:28.791
Shitou, go to the rear!

55:28.792 --> 55:30.375
Li Tong, take the wing!

55:43.958 --> 55:45.875
Come on! Get your gun!

55:54.208 --> 55:56.583
Chen Lu, get me the enemy's position!

56:01.708 --> 56:03.667
Hong Xu, bring everyone out!

56:04.667 --> 56:06.874
Yu Zhuang, look for
any ammunition that is left!

56:06.875 --> 56:07.792
Roger!

56:26.458 --> 56:27.958
Open the door!

56:37.000 --> 56:39.042
Mortars at two o'clock!

57:26.333 --> 57:29.042
Hide!

57:30.792 --> 57:31.667
Hong Xu!

57:34.833 --> 57:35.708
I'm okay.

57:36.875 --> 57:37.957
Save them!

57:37.958 --> 57:39.582
Hurry!

57:39.583 --> 57:41.000
Chen Lu, let's go!

58:03.750 --> 58:04.749
Shun Gu, Dong Li.

58:04.750 --> 58:07.457
Find an overwatch, wait for my orders!

58:07.458 --> 58:08.499
Roger!

58:08.500 --> 58:10.708
Tian-de Zhang, cover me!

58:14.333 --> 58:15.208
Move!

58:21.542 --> 58:23.375
Li Tong, cover me!

58:43.417 --> 58:45.292
Dong Li, move!

58:58.375 --> 58:59.499
His leg's gone,

58:59.500 --> 59:00.832
let's cut it off!

59:00.833 --> 59:01.708
Come on!

59:14.625 --> 59:15.583
Take him.

59:19.083 --> 59:20.000
Stay calm.

59:37.917 --> 59:40.082
Captain, it's Hong Xu.

59:40.083 --> 59:42.167
There's a live bomb on the bus.

59:56.667 --> 59:58.250
<i>Shun Gu, are you in position?</i>

59:59.333 --> 01:00:00.458
Not yet.

01:00:07.458 --> 01:00:08.583
Last round!

01:00:26.417 --> 01:00:28.582
Watch out! There is a sniper!

01:00:28.583 --> 01:00:29.792
Be careful, everyone!

01:00:35.125 --> 01:00:36.124
<i>Dong Li.</i>

01:00:36.125 --> 01:00:37.207
Listen to me.

01:00:37.208 --> 01:00:38.832
I'll hit their base.

01:00:38.833 --> 01:00:39.791
<i>But as soon as I fire,</i>

01:00:39.792 --> 01:00:41.541
<i>they'll have a fix on my position.</i>

01:00:41.542 --> 01:00:42.541
<i>Find them quickly.</i>

01:00:42.542 --> 01:00:43.749
<i>Do you read me?</i>

01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:44.583
Roger!

01:01:01.167 --> 01:01:02.082
<i>Shun Gu, quick!</i>

01:01:02.083 --> 01:01:03.167
<i>The smoke is clearing up!</i>

01:01:18.625 --> 01:01:19.750
Shun Gu in position.

01:01:58.333 --> 01:01:59.916
<i>There is a sniper at 2 o'clock,</i>

01:01:59.917 --> 01:02:01.791
<i>on the hill, near the peak,</i>

01:02:01.792 --> 01:02:03.416
<i>by a boulder.</i>

01:02:03.417 --> 01:02:07.333
It's 22 degrees east, 602 meters.

01:02:40.333 --> 01:02:42.625
Dong Li. Can you see him?

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.666
I see him.

01:02:47.667 --> 01:02:49.666
On the highest ridge,

01:02:49.667 --> 01:02:51.583
ten meters to the right.

01:02:53.042 --> 01:02:54.707
Dong Li, pin him down.

01:02:54.708 --> 01:02:55.875
I'll get the mortar.

01:03:37.292 --> 01:03:39.292
<i>Shun Gu, I've pinned him down.</i>

01:05:10.375 --> 01:05:12.458
Everyone, retreat!

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.083
Don't move! Don't move!

01:05:19.083 --> 01:05:20.833
Hold him down, I'll pull it out.

01:05:22.208 --> 01:05:23.125
Okay.

01:05:26.542 --> 01:05:27.500
Pull!

01:05:30.458 --> 01:05:31.583
Hold him down.

01:05:52.333 --> 01:05:53.500
Let's go.

01:06:17.417 --> 01:06:18.457
Hurry!

01:06:18.458 --> 01:06:19.999
Everyone, go now!

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.999
The bomb is going off!

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.042
Run!

01:06:24.167 --> 01:06:25.583
Hong Xu, run!

01:06:35.833 --> 01:06:37.374
<i>Captain.</i>

01:06:37.375 --> 01:06:39.166
Captain, are you okay?

01:06:39.167 --> 01:06:40.167
Captain!

01:06:44.833 --> 01:06:45.833
Where are the others?

01:06:59.625 --> 01:07:01.500
- Are you okay?
- Hurry and save the others!

01:07:03.375 --> 01:07:04.958
Come on!

01:07:10.417 --> 01:07:11.707
Shitou!

01:07:11.708 --> 01:07:13.166
- Hong Xu...
- Save the others!

01:07:13.167 --> 01:07:15.082
Hong Xu...

01:07:15.083 --> 01:07:16.249
Harder!

01:07:16.250 --> 01:07:17.749
Pull!

01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:19.291
Hurry!

01:07:19.292 --> 01:07:20.749
Nan Xia!

01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:22.208
- Nan Xia!
- Over here!

01:07:24.083 --> 01:07:25.000
Pull!

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:27.749
Harder!

01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:30.042
Are you okay?

01:07:52.708 --> 01:07:54.916
We're 80 kilometers from our target.

01:07:54.917 --> 01:07:57.541
But the ship sails in 90 minutes.

01:07:57.542 --> 01:07:58.666
We only have one vehicle left

01:07:58.667 --> 01:08:01.041
<i>and that's under repair.</i>

01:08:01.042 --> 01:08:02.749
We won't make it back in time.

01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:04.792
Can their troops give us more support?

01:08:06.167 --> 01:08:09.916
Our superiors put in a request,

01:08:09.917 --> 01:08:13.416
but they've no troops to spare.

01:08:13.417 --> 01:08:16.207
They can only get us out at a point

01:08:16.207 --> 01:08:19.291
<i>60 kilometers north of the target.</i>

01:08:19.292 --> 01:08:20.791
<i>After the rescue,</i>

01:08:20.792 --> 01:08:22.000
go straight there.

01:08:23.042 --> 01:08:28.166
But it's a very dangerous route.

01:08:28.167 --> 01:08:30.666
You need to be on high alert.

01:08:30.667 --> 01:08:31.666
<i>Roger that!</i>

01:08:31.667 --> 01:08:35.666
<i>Also, Zaka released a video.</i>

01:08:35.667 --> 01:08:38.167
They beheaded the reporter's assistant.

01:09:44.957 --> 01:09:46.582
Despite all those drills

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:48.957
and training,

01:09:52.207 --> 01:09:54.042
I never thought

01:09:55.792 --> 01:09:57.458
I'd lose control like that.

01:10:02.792 --> 01:10:03.708
Sir.

01:10:05.375 --> 01:10:06.958
I'm not good enough for Jiaolong.

01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:13.500
Do you remember how we became a team?

01:10:17.458 --> 01:10:20.041
We went through tough times.

01:10:20.042 --> 01:10:22.125
We were all tempted to quit,

01:10:23.625 --> 01:10:25.875
but we held on, right?

01:10:28.292 --> 01:10:29.874
The fact that we are here now

01:10:29.875 --> 01:10:32.500
proves we are all qualified.

01:10:35.333 --> 01:10:36.875
Think of our motto.

01:10:43.917 --> 01:10:45.458
"Conquer fear, conquer all."

01:11:19.125 --> 01:11:20.750
You did well just now.

01:11:24.333 --> 01:11:25.833
It wasn't for show.

01:11:29.042 --> 01:11:30.083
Well, I saw it.

01:11:42.542 --> 01:11:43.500
Does it hurt?

01:11:44.875 --> 01:11:45.833
A little.

01:12:00.625 --> 01:12:02.000
Don't think too much.

01:12:19.375 --> 01:12:20.917
You can come to Basem with us.

01:12:22.667 --> 01:12:24.958
Are we getting reinforcements? When?

01:12:28.792 --> 01:12:30.999
Listen.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.374
If you come with us,

01:12:32.375 --> 01:12:33.832
you have to follow orders, okay?

01:12:33.833 --> 01:12:34.791
Captain, let me tell you.

01:12:34.792 --> 01:12:36.832
Without reinforcements,
you have to be really careful.

01:12:36.833 --> 01:12:38.041
It's more than an hour away.

01:12:38.042 --> 01:12:39.124
Can you fix the vehicle?

01:12:39.125 --> 01:12:41.541
We're doing our best.

01:12:41.542 --> 01:12:42.999
That's none of your concern.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.457
I'm talking about the orders.

01:12:45.458 --> 01:12:47.291
It's about

01:12:47.292 --> 01:12:48.749
the battle just now.

01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:50.374
I told you to stay put.

01:12:50.375 --> 01:12:52.291
Sure, it was to save a life.

01:12:52.292 --> 01:12:54.874
But when there is action next time,

01:12:54.875 --> 01:12:56.166
considering the danger,

01:12:56.167 --> 01:12:58.874
no matter what happens,

01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:01.207
you do exactly as we say.

01:13:01.208 --> 01:13:03.333
- Okay?
- What if the order is wrong?

01:13:04.583 --> 01:13:07.291
How do you know it's right?

01:13:07.292 --> 01:13:08.666
Yes, we have different roles,

01:13:08.667 --> 01:13:12.291
- but as for our beliefs--
- If I'm wrong, I take responsibility!

01:13:12.292 --> 01:13:15.249
But if you disobey and you die,
who will be responsible then?

01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:16.417
If that's the case,

01:13:17.708 --> 01:13:19.125
then don't save me.

01:13:20.917 --> 01:13:22.624
<i>Captain, the vehicle has been fixed.</i>

01:13:22.625 --> 01:13:23.792
<i>Will be right there.</i>

01:13:28.625 --> 01:13:29.833
Roger.

01:13:31.542 --> 01:13:32.792
Everyone, move now.

01:13:39.667 --> 01:13:42.457
<i>Sayyid, how is Dr. William?</i>

01:13:42.458 --> 01:13:43.417
<i>He is alive.</i>

01:13:44.417 --> 01:13:46.042
But still unconscious.

01:13:48.208 --> 01:13:52.250
<i>Besides the yellowcake,</i>

01:13:53.833 --> 01:13:57.667
<i>we need the formula for the dirty bomb.</i>

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.832
<i>Understand?</i>

01:14:00.833 --> 01:14:01.917
Yes.

01:14:47.833 --> 01:14:48.832
Yu Zhuang.

01:14:48.833 --> 01:14:50.082
Find a high place.

01:14:50.083 --> 01:14:51.249
Set up an antenna.

01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:52.541
Keep contact with base.

01:14:52.542 --> 01:14:53.375
<i>Roger that.</i>

01:15:00.542 --> 01:15:01.708
Testing, testing.

01:15:41.458 --> 01:15:44.124
Don't be scared.

01:15:44.125 --> 01:15:49.624
The Chinese Navy is here to rescue people.

01:15:49.625 --> 01:15:50.750
Don't be scared.

01:15:56.458 --> 01:15:57.541
The house owner, Bella,

01:15:57.542 --> 01:15:59.916
says they came a week ago,

01:15:59.917 --> 01:16:01.082
killed all the men,

01:16:01.083 --> 01:16:02.249
chased off the others,

01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:03.749
and kept them here to cook.

01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:04.749
In the town now,

01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:06.666
there are about 150 terrorists.

01:16:06.667 --> 01:16:08.291
They stay around the square.

01:16:08.292 --> 01:16:09.542
She drew a map.

01:16:11.250 --> 01:16:13.832
This is their headquarters.

01:16:13.833 --> 01:16:15.874
The hostage camp is to the north.

01:16:15.875 --> 01:16:16.999
They have about ten guards

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.916
and 25 hostages in there.

01:16:18.917 --> 01:16:20.166
They are all foreigners

01:16:20.167 --> 01:16:21.499
except for five soldiers.

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:23.332
There are three women,
one of them is Asian.

01:16:23.333 --> 01:16:25.166
Her description matches Mei Deng's.

01:16:25.167 --> 01:16:26.249
Hold on.

01:16:26.250 --> 01:16:28.250
How can we access the camp?

01:16:31.792 --> 01:16:33.083
Only through the square.

01:16:34.375 --> 01:16:36.291
Send a situation report to the ship.

01:16:36.292 --> 01:16:37.250
Yes, sir.

01:16:41.417 --> 01:16:43.582
It's eight against 150 people.

01:16:43.583 --> 01:16:45.207
Have you ever done anything
like this before?

01:16:45.208 --> 01:16:46.166
Our unit's mission

01:16:46.167 --> 01:16:48.541
is not to deal with those 150 people.

01:16:48.542 --> 01:16:51.208
It's to rescue the Chinese hostage.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.250
So is there no hope for the others?

01:16:59.958 --> 01:17:00.958
There's no time.

01:17:05.167 --> 01:17:07.499
Is it possible

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:09.582
for you

01:17:09.583 --> 01:17:11.249
to save one more person?

01:17:11.250 --> 01:17:12.625
Is there any chance of that?

01:17:18.250 --> 01:17:19.750
Your assistant, Abu

01:17:21.250 --> 01:17:22.458
has been executed.

01:17:31.375 --> 01:17:33.166
When did that happened?

01:17:33.167 --> 01:17:34.292
Before we got here.

01:18:12.958 --> 01:18:14.291
My husband and child

01:18:14.292 --> 01:18:16.292
died on a bus just like today.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.250
<i>In 2005,</i>

01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:31.000
<i>when they blew up the bus in London.</i>

01:18:34.917 --> 01:18:36.958
The police told me

01:18:38.250 --> 01:18:39.917
that nothing was left of them,

01:18:43.083 --> 01:18:45.500
but a little blue bracelet.

01:18:50.333 --> 01:18:52.249
That's when

01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:54.916
I vowed to fight against them to the end.

01:18:54.917 --> 01:18:56.791
To fight against the terrorist groups.

01:18:56.792 --> 01:18:58.999
I'm not afraid of anything,

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.500
even death.

01:19:01.917 --> 01:19:04.167
I'm only afraid
of being powerless to help.

01:19:06.958 --> 01:19:08.875
I've failed to protect anyone.

01:19:10.167 --> 01:19:12.791
Not even Abu. I've failed to protect him.

01:19:12.792 --> 01:19:14.292
I've failed.

01:19:20.667 --> 01:19:22.666
The captain says, the only support

01:19:22.667 --> 01:19:25.457
will be a chopper for evacuation,

01:19:25.458 --> 01:19:26.917
but they can't say when.

01:19:29.542 --> 01:19:31.082
In addition to Mei Deng,

01:19:31.083 --> 01:19:33.417
I want to rescue the others too.

01:19:34.583 --> 01:19:35.792
Do you have a strategy?

01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:42.332
With so many people,

01:19:42.333 --> 01:19:43.999
we can't take that road back.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:44.957
It's better

01:19:44.958 --> 01:19:47.291
to go north through the desert,

01:19:47.292 --> 01:19:48.291
straight to the army base.

01:19:48.292 --> 01:19:51.374
The problem is we'll be exposed
if they started to chase us.

01:19:51.375 --> 01:19:52.832
Mei Deng is the priority.

01:19:52.833 --> 01:19:55.291
Once she's safely out,

01:19:55.292 --> 01:19:57.083
we regroup and get the hostages.

01:19:58.375 --> 01:20:01.207
Quickly tell Shitou and Li Tong

01:20:01.208 --> 01:20:02.874
to disguise themselves as terrorists

01:20:02.875 --> 01:20:04.291
and infiltrate the camp.

01:20:04.292 --> 01:20:08.291
Remember.
Li Tong and Mei Deng will trade clothes.

01:20:08.292 --> 01:20:10.791
Shitou will take her back the way we came.

01:20:10.792 --> 01:20:12.832
Tell Shun Gu and Dong Li.

01:20:12.833 --> 01:20:13.874
Find an overwatch

01:20:13.875 --> 01:20:16.791
where they can control the square.

01:20:16.792 --> 01:20:18.832
Once we enter the town,

01:20:18.833 --> 01:20:20.624
all our signals will be jammed.

01:20:20.625 --> 01:20:22.374
So I have to tell Yu Zhuang

01:20:22.375 --> 01:20:23.832
to set up an anti-jamming device

01:20:23.833 --> 01:20:26.042
to secure our communications.

01:20:27.042 --> 01:20:27.999
As for Nan Xia,

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.832
have her stay here with Yu Zhuang.

01:20:29.833 --> 01:20:31.791
They'll go as soon as Mei Deng's out.

01:20:31.792 --> 01:20:33.541
Finally, you, Chen Lu and I

01:20:33.542 --> 01:20:35.416
will watch the square.

01:20:35.417 --> 01:20:39.082
Once we know Mei Deng is safe
and has arrived at Bella's house,

01:20:39.083 --> 01:20:40.291
we'll blow up

01:20:40.292 --> 01:20:42.207
their access to the camp.

01:20:42.208 --> 01:20:44.041
The three of us will go into the camp

01:20:44.042 --> 01:20:46.375
and rescue the other hostages.

01:20:47.917 --> 01:20:49.916
But if Li Tong is with them,

01:20:49.917 --> 01:20:51.499
and a battle breaks out in the square,

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:53.124
we won't have enough firepower.

01:20:53.125 --> 01:20:54.541
You're already outnumbered.

01:20:54.542 --> 01:20:55.624
I'll switch with Mei Deng.

01:20:55.625 --> 01:20:57.167
I look more like her too.

01:21:00.167 --> 01:21:02.249
Captain, I think that's not a bad idea.

01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:03.542
I disagree.

01:21:18.375 --> 01:21:20.500
I know nothing.

01:21:33.917 --> 01:21:35.291
Do you have nothing to say?

01:21:35.292 --> 01:21:36.417
Please.

01:21:37.542 --> 01:21:39.542
What do you want to know?

01:21:43.958 --> 01:21:46.207
Your wound is not looking so good.

01:21:46.208 --> 01:21:48.292
- I really don't know--
- Let me fix it.

01:21:56.542 --> 01:21:59.666
Please, I know nothing!

01:21:59.667 --> 01:22:02.666
You're hiding something. Where is it?

01:22:02.667 --> 01:22:07.417
I really don't know...

01:22:08.667 --> 01:22:10.083
Think it over.

01:22:14.208 --> 01:22:16.291
Aluka Desert!

01:22:16.292 --> 01:22:18.000
Aluka Desert!

01:22:42.333 --> 01:22:44.458
<i>Dong Li, you cover this area.</i>

01:22:46.542 --> 01:22:49.541
<i>Shun Gu, you take the arches.</i>

01:22:49.542 --> 01:22:51.208
No problem. Got them.

01:22:55.375 --> 01:22:57.333
Captain, we're in.

01:23:39.583 --> 01:23:40.874
Do as I say.

01:23:40.875 --> 01:23:42.458
The Chinese Navy is here to save you.

01:24:03.417 --> 01:24:05.749
<i>Chen Lu, I found a truck.</i>

01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:07.749
<i>I'll stop it near the hostage camp.</i>

01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:08.791
<i>Guard the right flank.</i>

01:24:08.792 --> 01:24:10.000
<i>I'll prepare the bomb.</i>

01:24:39.875 --> 01:24:41.957
Base, this is Unit One.

01:24:41.958 --> 01:24:43.874
Can you read me?

01:24:43.875 --> 01:24:45.999
<i>Yu Zhuang, what's wrong?</i>

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.749
Captain, we lost contact with the ship.

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:50.666
I'll go check.

01:24:50.667 --> 01:24:52.916
<i>Roger. Stay safe.</i>

01:24:52.917 --> 01:24:53.792
Will do.

01:25:14.375 --> 01:25:15.332
<i>Boss.</i>

01:25:15.333 --> 01:25:17.583
<i>There's a Chinese soldier on the hill.</i>

01:25:19.458 --> 01:25:21.499
Execute the Chinese hostage.

01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:23.332
If they want to rescue her,

01:25:23.333 --> 01:25:27.041
let them rescue a corpse.

01:25:27.042 --> 01:25:28.541
<i>And tell our brothers</i>

01:25:28.542 --> 01:25:30.375
<i>to attack the ship.</i>

01:25:40.333 --> 01:25:42.666
What are you doing?

01:25:42.667 --> 01:25:44.167
What are you doing?

01:25:46.083 --> 01:25:48.250
Captain, they just took Nan Xia.

01:25:50.042 --> 01:25:52.083
<i>Hong Xu, why was Nan Xia there?</i>

01:25:55.708 --> 01:25:57.041
Shitou,

01:25:57.042 --> 01:25:58.249
once you've left the camp,

01:25:58.250 --> 01:26:00.666
<i>jump out and prepare to attack it.</i>

01:26:00.667 --> 01:26:01.999
<i>Everyone else,</i>

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.667
hold fire until Mei Deng is safe.

01:26:12.542 --> 01:26:14.042
What are you doing?

01:26:17.958 --> 01:26:20.124
Dong Li, I'm going into the headquarters.

01:26:20.125 --> 01:26:21.375
Cover me.

01:26:37.833 --> 01:26:39.332
<i>I'm on the second floor, left passage.</i>

01:26:39.333 --> 01:26:40.249
<i>Can you see me?</i>

01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:41.457
I see you.

01:26:41.458 --> 01:26:42.666
<i>Secure the area.</i>

01:26:42.667 --> 01:26:43.542
Roger.

01:26:56.708 --> 01:26:57.666
She's so loud.

01:26:57.667 --> 01:26:58.917
Turn up the music.

01:27:13.792 --> 01:27:14.916
Captain, Commissar.

01:27:14.917 --> 01:27:16.707
Reporting, the weapons on the hill

01:27:16.708 --> 01:27:17.832
are aiming at us!

01:27:17.833 --> 01:27:19.541
Battle-ready deployment grade one!

01:27:19.542 --> 01:27:21.750
- Yes, sir!
- Grade one!

01:27:27.417 --> 01:27:28.708
Auxiliary gun on intercept!

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.042
- Main gun target the hill!
- Yes, sir!

01:27:45.042 --> 01:27:46.207
Target is locked!

01:27:46.208 --> 01:27:47.042
Fire!

01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:58.791
Mohadi is ruining
our people's lives every day.

01:27:58.792 --> 01:28:02.207
And brave soldiers like us
can wait no longer.

01:28:02.208 --> 01:28:04.041
We must punish this Chinese citizen.

01:28:04.042 --> 01:28:05.833
- Only blood will teach--
- Wait!

01:28:11.958 --> 01:28:13.000
Who are you?

01:28:14.917 --> 01:28:16.374
Who are you?

01:28:16.375 --> 01:28:18.249
Where is the other girl?

01:28:18.250 --> 01:28:20.082
Where is the other girl?

01:28:20.083 --> 01:28:21.083
Who brought you here?

01:28:22.333 --> 01:28:23.832
How many of you are here?

01:28:23.833 --> 01:28:25.207
Answer me!

01:28:25.208 --> 01:28:26.957
Answer me!

01:28:26.958 --> 01:28:28.332
How many of you are here?

01:28:28.333 --> 01:28:31.082
Start talking or I'll break your legs!

01:28:31.083 --> 01:28:32.374
Answer me now!

01:28:32.375 --> 01:28:33.833
Do you want me to kill you?

01:28:55.792 --> 01:28:57.916
I'm sorry.

01:28:57.917 --> 01:29:00.667
Don't take it personally.

01:29:13.708 --> 01:29:16.083
Captain, we're leaving the camp.

01:30:07.625 --> 01:30:08.666
Come on!

01:30:08.667 --> 01:30:10.124
This is William. His necklace is gone.

01:30:10.125 --> 01:30:11.707
- What necklace?
- It has the information.

01:30:11.708 --> 01:30:12.542
Let's go.

01:30:20.250 --> 01:30:22.582
<i>Captain, I'm about to enter the square.</i>

01:30:22.583 --> 01:30:23.833
<i>But I got a flat tire.</i>

01:30:27.417 --> 01:30:28.875
Keep calm, everyone.

01:30:43.167 --> 01:30:45.457
<i>Dong Li, I'm coming out.</i>

01:30:45.458 --> 01:30:47.207
<i>Is the path clear?</i>

01:30:47.208 --> 01:30:49.166
All clear.

01:30:49.167 --> 01:30:50.666
<i>Everyone, listen to me.</i>

01:30:50.667 --> 01:30:52.874
<i>No matter what happens over here,</i>

01:30:52.875 --> 01:30:54.250
<i>stick to the plan.</i>

01:30:57.333 --> 01:30:59.749
Your tire is flat!

01:30:59.750 --> 01:31:01.332
Remember.

01:31:01.333 --> 01:31:03.291
No matter what happens, take the girl

01:31:03.292 --> 01:31:04.791
and follow me.

01:31:04.792 --> 01:31:07.833
Don't be scared, Aisha. Stay with me.

01:31:09.417 --> 01:31:11.957
Wait, the tire is leaking air.

01:31:11.958 --> 01:31:14.083
Captain, they stopped Li Tong's truck.

01:31:38.083 --> 01:31:39.917
Intruders!

01:32:44.208 --> 01:32:45.957
We're retreating to the junkyard.

01:32:45.958 --> 01:32:46.875
Cover us!

01:32:51.833 --> 01:32:52.917
Follow me.

01:32:58.583 --> 01:32:59.542
Go!

01:33:04.125 --> 01:33:05.208
Go in!

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.332
Hide!

01:33:08.333 --> 01:33:09.417
Find cover!

01:33:13.208 --> 01:33:14.458
Put this on!

01:33:23.042 --> 01:33:24.791
Hong Xu, what's your status?

01:33:24.792 --> 01:33:27.666
<i>Captain, we're trapped in the square.</i>

01:33:27.667 --> 01:33:28.999
<i>What about you?</i>

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.041
When you have the chance,

01:33:30.042 --> 01:33:32.749
take them all out using the back way.

01:33:32.750 --> 01:33:34.041
<i>Roger.</i>

01:33:34.042 --> 01:33:35.124
<i>What's your plan?</i>

01:33:35.125 --> 01:33:36.291
I'll think of one.

01:33:36.292 --> 01:33:38.625
Remember, make sure Mei Deng is safe!

01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:44.583
YELLOWCAKE 27 TONS

01:34:21.583 --> 01:34:23.792
Keep on going.
I'll take care of the snipers.

01:34:25.208 --> 01:34:27.582
Dong Li, they saw me.

01:34:27.583 --> 01:34:28.999
He's close by.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.541
He know where I am.

01:34:30.542 --> 01:34:32.541
Find him quickly.

01:34:32.542 --> 01:34:33.791
Do you read me?

01:34:33.792 --> 01:34:34.667
Roger!

01:34:39.167 --> 01:34:42.041
Captain, their sniper found me.

01:34:42.042 --> 01:34:43.249
<i>I've lost my position.</i>

01:34:43.250 --> 01:34:44.333
<i>Be careful.</i>

01:35:31.875 --> 01:35:34.125
Get up! We'll go that way! Heads down!

01:35:40.875 --> 01:35:42.332
Li Tong!

01:35:42.333 --> 01:35:43.374
Are you okay?

01:35:43.375 --> 01:35:44.749
Answer me!

01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:46.082
<i>Our exit is cut off by fire.</i>

01:35:46.083 --> 01:35:47.250
<i>It's coming our way!</i>

01:35:51.583 --> 01:35:53.583
Chen Lu! Give me a grenade!

01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:56.375
Here!

01:35:59.250 --> 01:36:01.167
<i>Li Tong! Get to the back.</i>

01:36:02.167 --> 01:36:03.333
Stay right here.

01:36:04.458 --> 01:36:06.042
Hong Xu!

01:36:10.625 --> 01:36:12.416
Li Tong, blast your way out.

01:36:12.417 --> 01:36:13.457
I'll cover you!

01:36:13.458 --> 01:36:14.375
Go!

01:36:24.667 --> 01:36:25.875
Let's go!

01:36:30.958 --> 01:36:32.541
<i>Chen Lu, cover Li Tong.</i>

01:36:32.542 --> 01:36:34.417
<i>We'll retreat to the camp.</i>

01:36:37.083 --> 01:36:38.582
Li Tong, go!

01:36:38.583 --> 01:36:40.499
Follow me!

01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:41.500
Go back!

01:36:51.917 --> 01:36:54.167
Chen Lu, fall back!

01:36:55.833 --> 01:36:57.791
We have to escape.

01:36:57.792 --> 01:36:59.124
Pull this pin.

01:36:59.125 --> 01:37:01.000
When I say throw, you throw. Got it?

01:37:02.958 --> 01:37:04.375
We'll fight to the end!

01:37:08.250 --> 01:37:09.167
Let's go!

01:37:10.375 --> 01:37:12.333
Nan Xia, throw!

01:37:25.167 --> 01:37:26.042
Move!

01:37:33.333 --> 01:37:34.917
Blow them up!

01:37:39.208 --> 01:37:40.166
Do you hear me?

01:37:40.167 --> 01:37:42.457
Kill the hostages!

01:37:42.458 --> 01:37:44.749
They're going to kill the hostages!

01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:46.166
Shitou, go to the camp now!

01:37:46.167 --> 01:37:48.208
Save the hostages!
Don't let them kill the hostages!

01:38:32.917 --> 01:38:34.749
<i>Sir, the exit is clear.</i>

01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:35.999
<i>The hostages are all safe.</i>

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.042
<i>Hurry over here!</i>

01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:49.957
<i>Shitou, the exit's blocked!</i>

01:38:49.958 --> 01:38:51.125
<i>Help us!</i>

01:38:57.875 --> 01:38:59.707
Stay back, hide!

01:38:59.708 --> 01:39:01.332
<i>Hong Xu, I'm out of ammunition!</i>

01:39:01.333 --> 01:39:02.457
Shitou! Go and help Chen Lu!

01:39:02.458 --> 01:39:03.999
Hang in there. I have a plan.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:04.917
Roger.

01:39:22.750 --> 01:39:25.291
<i>There is a way out to the small plaza
at right of the junkyard.</i>

01:39:25.292 --> 01:39:26.374
<i>Use that way to get out.</i>

01:39:26.375 --> 01:39:27.666
<i>I'll cover you.</i>

01:39:27.667 --> 01:39:28.583
<i>Wait for my signal.</i>

01:39:38.167 --> 01:39:39.166
Chen Lu, Li Tong.

01:39:39.167 --> 01:39:40.457
<i>I've taken over a tank.</i>

01:39:40.458 --> 01:39:42.041
<i>I'll deal with the enemies around you.</i>

01:39:42.042 --> 01:39:43.916
<i>Stay hidden and wait for my signal.</i>

01:39:43.917 --> 01:39:45.207
<i>Li Tong.</i>

01:39:45.208 --> 01:39:46.499
After you have escaped,

01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:48.082
- go to the meeting point.
<i>- Roger.</i>

01:39:48.083 --> 01:39:50.500
<i>Captain, I'll rescue you next!</i>

01:39:51.667 --> 01:39:52.542
Ready.

01:39:53.625 --> 01:39:54.542
Ready.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:56.917
Fire!

01:40:34.125 --> 01:40:35.457
Captain, what's your position?

01:40:35.458 --> 01:40:36.999
<i>I'm at the right of the main passage.</i>

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.874
<i>But I'm surrounded
by the terrorists on the left.</i>

01:40:38.875 --> 01:40:40.416
Got it.

01:40:40.417 --> 01:40:41.624
<i>Ready!</i>

01:40:41.625 --> 01:40:43.082
<i>Take cover!</i>

01:40:43.083 --> 01:40:44.042
<i>Fire!</i>

01:40:56.958 --> 01:40:57.875
Wear this!

01:41:13.125 --> 01:41:14.082
Move!

01:41:14.083 --> 01:41:16.249
Captain, we found a truck.

01:41:16.250 --> 01:41:17.207
We're moving now.

01:41:17.208 --> 01:41:18.250
Mei Deng is safe.

01:41:23.833 --> 01:41:24.875
Go!

01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:43.249
<i>Yu Zhuang, do you read me?</i>

01:41:43.250 --> 01:41:44.291
Yes.

01:41:44.292 --> 01:41:45.541
Contact base.

01:41:45.542 --> 01:41:47.582
<i>Then take Yuna to the meeting point
and wait for orders.</i>

01:41:47.583 --> 01:41:49.291
<i>- Do you read me?</i>
- Roger.

01:41:49.292 --> 01:41:51.417
Base, this is Unit One.

01:41:53.167 --> 01:41:54.833
Base, this is Unit One!

01:41:55.875 --> 01:41:58.666
<i>Unit One, do you read me?</i>

01:41:58.667 --> 01:42:00.917
Captain, we've lost Jiaolong's signal.

01:42:03.667 --> 01:42:04.999
We tried to reach them,

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.749
but to no avail.

01:42:06.750 --> 01:42:08.332
How about their individual positions?

01:42:08.333 --> 01:42:09.833
We've lost those too.

01:42:11.833 --> 01:42:13.666
Stay on high alert, keep trying.

01:42:13.667 --> 01:42:15.499
Yes, sir!

01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:16.500
Captain.

01:42:18.375 --> 01:42:20.207
The ship is under threat.

01:42:20.208 --> 01:42:21.666
To protect the citizens on board,

01:42:21.667 --> 01:42:23.624
we'll move away from the port.

01:42:23.625 --> 01:42:24.542
Okay.

01:42:26.125 --> 01:42:28.916
Let me see if our superiors

01:42:28.917 --> 01:42:30.583
will approve of sending in a drone.

01:42:32.417 --> 01:42:33.749
Follow me!

01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:35.000
Come on! Come on!

01:44:40.208 --> 01:44:41.208
Shun Gu!

01:45:55.917 --> 01:45:57.667
Captain, do you read me?

01:46:03.250 --> 01:46:05.125
Get down!

01:46:28.417 --> 01:46:29.458
Shitou!

01:47:06.708 --> 01:47:07.874
Any Signal yet?

01:47:07.875 --> 01:47:08.832
No.

01:47:08.833 --> 01:47:09.957
To the meeting point.

01:47:09.958 --> 01:47:10.792
Go.

01:47:14.667 --> 01:47:16.000
Shitou, don't move!

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:18.167
Don't move!

01:47:40.125 --> 01:47:41.708
Out of the car!

01:47:46.833 --> 01:47:49.082
Hurry!

01:47:49.083 --> 01:47:50.417
Get down!

01:48:00.083 --> 01:48:02.000
Take cover!

01:48:10.042 --> 01:48:10.917
Don't move!

01:48:12.417 --> 01:48:13.458
Don't move!

01:48:26.417 --> 01:48:27.625
Shitou, hold on!

01:49:22.375 --> 01:49:24.291
Li Tong and the others are in danger.

01:49:24.292 --> 01:49:25.292
They are down there.

01:49:28.917 --> 01:49:29.874
<i>Reporting.</i>

01:49:29.875 --> 01:49:31.791
We have Jiaolong but the signal's weak.

01:49:31.792 --> 01:49:34.082
But there's a sandstorm nearby.

01:49:34.083 --> 01:49:35.124
Did you make contact?

01:49:35.125 --> 01:49:37.041
Not yet for now due
to weather interference.

01:49:37.042 --> 01:49:38.666
How much longer?

01:49:38.667 --> 01:49:39.708
We have seven minutes.

01:50:00.208 --> 01:50:01.667
You need it more.

01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:09.082
Stay there!

01:50:09.083 --> 01:50:10.791
<i>Li Tong, hang on!</i>

01:50:10.792 --> 01:50:11.957
<i>We're nearly there.</i>

01:50:11.958 --> 01:50:13.833
Hurry!

01:50:20.667 --> 01:50:22.167
Chen Lu, secure the entrance.

01:51:11.375 --> 01:51:13.416
It's okay, Shitou.

01:51:13.417 --> 01:51:14.417
It's okay.

01:51:23.958 --> 01:51:25.708
It hurts...

01:51:31.875 --> 01:51:33.124
Have a candy.

01:51:33.125 --> 01:51:34.082
The candy will help.

01:51:34.083 --> 01:51:35.166
Didn't you say

01:51:35.167 --> 01:51:36.624
that candy can kill the pain.

01:51:36.625 --> 01:51:37.917
It takes away the pain.

01:51:44.958 --> 01:51:46.957
Here. Eat this candy.

01:51:46.958 --> 01:51:48.707
Come on.

01:51:48.708 --> 01:51:51.291
Candy takes away the pain...

01:51:51.292 --> 01:51:53.207
We're going home.

01:51:53.208 --> 01:51:54.250
Going home...

01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:57.917
Going home...

01:52:11.167 --> 01:52:13.250
Shitou!

01:52:14.333 --> 01:52:16.124
No more pain.

01:52:16.125 --> 01:52:19.042
We're going home...

01:52:57.458 --> 01:53:00.874
Tank Alpha, attack from the right!

01:53:00.875 --> 01:53:01.832
<i>Hong Xu.</i>

01:53:01.833 --> 01:53:04.167
Turn 20 degrees left, hurry!

01:53:14.625 --> 01:53:16.166
Hong Xu.

01:53:16.167 --> 01:53:18.874
The reactive armor protects them.

01:53:18.875 --> 01:53:20.207
<i>Turn a sharp left.</i>

01:53:20.208 --> 01:53:21.917
<i>Shoot at their treads.</i>

01:53:30.875 --> 01:53:32.125
Got them!

01:53:40.250 --> 01:53:42.041
Captain, they hit our cooling system.

01:53:42.042 --> 01:53:43.375
We won't last much longer.

01:53:52.458 --> 01:53:55.124
Captain, there is a sandstorm ahead!

01:53:55.125 --> 01:53:56.832
Charge straight at it.

01:53:56.833 --> 01:53:58.625
<i>It will cover us.</i>

01:54:16.292 --> 01:54:17.541
Hong Xu.

01:54:17.542 --> 01:54:19.082
Our turret took a hit.

01:54:19.083 --> 01:54:20.417
<i>Don't let them lock onto us!</i>

01:54:32.458 --> 01:54:33.874
Hong Xu.

01:54:33.875 --> 01:54:36.541
I'll use your steering for aim.

01:54:36.542 --> 01:54:38.291
Do you understand?

01:54:38.292 --> 01:54:39.250
Roger!

01:54:40.375 --> 01:54:41.874
Nan Xia.

01:54:41.875 --> 01:54:43.707
We have to switch places.

01:54:43.708 --> 01:54:46.332
The handset has a trigger.

01:54:46.333 --> 01:54:48.082
When I say fire, press it.

01:54:48.083 --> 01:54:49.458
I'll help you.

01:55:10.292 --> 01:55:11.666
Hong Xu.

01:55:11.667 --> 01:55:14.166
Let the reactive armor take a hit.

01:55:14.167 --> 01:55:15.707
<i>Follow my orders.</i>

01:55:15.708 --> 01:55:17.750
<i>First, take a sharp left
and then sharp right!</i>

01:55:21.917 --> 01:55:24.000
Hong Xu, turn left!

01:55:42.417 --> 01:55:43.708
<i>Turn right!</i>

01:55:45.708 --> 01:55:47.583
Nan Xia, get ready!

01:55:53.458 --> 01:55:55.125
Fire!

01:56:08.708 --> 01:56:09.832
<i>Captain!</i>

01:56:09.833 --> 01:56:11.458
We're stuck!

01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:24.749
<i>Captain, I'll deal with their tanks!</i>

01:56:24.750 --> 01:56:25.749
Hong Xu!

01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:26.750
Hong Xu!

01:56:41.208 --> 01:56:43.707
Nan Xia, we're going out.

01:56:43.708 --> 01:56:44.707
Remember.

01:56:44.708 --> 01:56:46.541
When we go out,
keep your hand on my shoulder.

01:56:46.542 --> 01:56:47.583
Understand?

01:57:29.917 --> 01:57:31.208
Wait here, don't move!

01:58:06.375 --> 01:58:07.582
Captain, Commissar.

01:58:07.583 --> 01:58:09.916
The drone has found Rui Yang and Hong Xu.

01:58:09.917 --> 01:58:11.375
But we still don't have contact.

01:58:12.458 --> 01:58:14.249
Reporting, the drone is losing power

01:58:14.250 --> 01:58:15.458
and could drop at any time.

01:58:38.250 --> 01:58:40.000
They're attacking, quick!

01:58:58.417 --> 01:58:59.750
Load up, hurry!

01:59:07.583 --> 01:59:08.625
<i>Prepare to fire!</i>

01:59:23.667 --> 01:59:24.707
Are you okay?

01:59:24.708 --> 01:59:26.583
Yes, I am...

01:59:47.333 --> 01:59:48.583
You're a good shot.

02:00:27.375 --> 02:00:29.082
Captain.

02:00:29.083 --> 02:00:30.583
Our mission is accomplished.

02:00:50.667 --> 02:00:52.582
Captain Yang.

02:00:52.583 --> 02:00:53.750
Thank you so much.

02:01:12.583 --> 02:01:13.958
- Captain Yang.
- Thank you.

02:01:16.583 --> 02:01:18.916
<i>The weather is preventing us
from contacting your warship,</i>

02:01:18.917 --> 02:01:22.291
<i>and we are unable to deal with the
yellowcake situation at the moment.</i>

02:01:22.292 --> 02:01:24.167
<i>All we can provide is a helicopter.</i>

02:01:26.583 --> 02:01:27.875
This

02:01:29.750 --> 02:01:31.125
works pretty well.

02:01:33.417 --> 02:01:34.875
Remember to give it back.

02:01:39.667 --> 02:01:41.166
We can't just ignore

02:01:41.167 --> 02:01:43.166
this yellowcake crisis.

02:01:43.167 --> 02:01:45.041
The hiding place for the yellowcake

02:01:45.042 --> 02:01:46.541
is 80 kilometers from here.

02:01:46.542 --> 02:01:47.707
But in 40 minutes,

02:01:47.708 --> 02:01:49.333
the terrorists will leave
with the yellowcake.

02:01:50.417 --> 02:01:51.957
We have to hurry.

02:01:51.958 --> 02:01:53.457
But I need to stress one thing.

02:01:53.458 --> 02:01:55.332
This operation

02:01:55.333 --> 02:01:56.875
hasn't been authorized yet.

02:02:00.417 --> 02:02:01.416
If we do this,

02:02:01.417 --> 02:02:02.292
we do it together.

02:02:04.042 --> 02:02:05.374
Captain.

02:02:05.375 --> 02:02:06.708
I'll wait for your orders.

02:02:19.958 --> 02:02:21.292
"Conquer fear, conquer all."

02:02:52.250 --> 02:02:54.208
<i>Two kilometers from destination!</i>

02:03:43.250 --> 02:03:45.082
<i>Our target is the yellowcake.</i>

02:03:45.083 --> 02:03:46.874
<i>Avoid engaging.</i>

02:03:46.875 --> 02:03:49.291
<i>Li Tong, we'll take the plane
and yellowcake.</i>

02:03:49.292 --> 02:03:51.666
<i>Shun Gu, Dong Li.
Find an overwatch and cover us.</i>

02:03:51.667 --> 02:03:52.708
<i>Split up!</i>

02:04:15.125 --> 02:04:16.875
<i>Captain, we're in position.</i>

02:04:22.417 --> 02:04:23.375
Clear.

02:04:42.875 --> 02:04:45.332
Captain, we've taken the control tower.

02:04:45.333 --> 02:04:47.208
<i>Roger. Wait for orders.</i>

02:04:53.583 --> 02:04:55.667
You go first.
I'll wait for the next truck.

02:05:07.625 --> 02:05:09.207
Boss.

02:05:09.208 --> 02:05:11.833
The rebels' representative will arrive
in five minutes.

02:05:14.292 --> 02:05:16.957
<i>Attention, sniper's hide.</i>

02:05:16.958 --> 02:05:19.042
<i>Li Tong is under the truck.</i>

02:05:20.083 --> 02:05:21.125
I see her.

02:05:25.042 --> 02:05:28.124
You did a good job just then.

02:05:28.125 --> 02:05:29.416
When we go back,

02:05:29.417 --> 02:05:31.458
you can train as a sniper.

02:05:32.667 --> 02:05:34.707
If I were that good,

02:05:34.708 --> 02:05:36.250
I should have hit it at once.

02:05:37.583 --> 02:05:41.082
Even the experienced feel pressure.

02:05:41.083 --> 02:05:42.791
Embrace it.

02:05:42.792 --> 02:05:44.625
Pressure keeps you focused.

02:06:36.375 --> 02:06:38.083
I didn't know it'd be you.

02:06:39.583 --> 02:06:41.874
It's been a long time, boss!

02:06:41.875 --> 02:06:44.875
You've not been home in a long time.

02:06:45.875 --> 02:06:47.167
We're fighting...

02:06:49.167 --> 02:06:51.332
for a better life.

02:06:51.333 --> 02:06:54.083
Why go home?

02:06:55.833 --> 02:07:02.167
We're not fighting this war for you.

02:07:04.750 --> 02:07:06.917
What about the formula, boss?

02:07:32.083 --> 02:07:34.082
Everyone, listen up.
There is a change in our plan.

02:07:34.083 --> 02:07:36.041
<i>I'm going to go for their leader.</i>

02:07:36.042 --> 02:07:38.041
<i>Dong Li, when I come out,</i>

02:07:38.042 --> 02:07:40.332
<i>they'll be after me. Cover me.</i>

02:07:40.333 --> 02:07:41.332
<i>Shun Gu,</i>

02:07:41.333 --> 02:07:43.541
<i>help Li Tong take the plane.</i>

02:07:43.542 --> 02:07:44.458
<i>Over.</i>

02:07:47.042 --> 02:07:48.207
Yes, sir.

02:07:48.208 --> 02:07:50.874
<i>The rebels will eat us alive.</i>

02:07:50.875 --> 02:07:54.541
<i>You must bring back all the yellowcakes.</i>

02:07:54.542 --> 02:07:56.624
<i>Kill them all.</i>

02:07:56.625 --> 02:07:57.666
<i>From now on</i>

02:07:57.667 --> 02:07:59.041
<i>this war belongs to us.</i>

02:07:59.042 --> 02:08:00.042
I understand.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:07.707
Calling base! Mayday!

02:08:07.708 --> 02:08:08.708
We're under attack! Help...

02:08:11.875 --> 02:08:13.583
Li Tong, take control of the plane!

02:08:18.417 --> 02:08:21.167
Don't move!

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.832
<i>Everyone, I'm coming out.</i>

02:08:52.833 --> 02:08:54.250
Dong Li, be careful!

02:09:03.083 --> 02:09:04.667
Dong Li, take out the last car!

02:09:33.958 --> 02:09:36.332
Shun Gu, Dong Li!

02:09:36.333 --> 02:09:38.499
<i>Shun Gu, Dong Li!</i>

02:09:38.500 --> 02:09:40.458
Li Tong, do you read me?

02:10:25.833 --> 02:10:27.917
Don't move!

02:10:30.750 --> 02:10:31.916
Shun Gu!

02:10:31.917 --> 02:10:32.958
Are you okay?

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:47.291
Get out!

02:10:47.292 --> 02:10:48.167
Hurry!

02:10:49.583 --> 02:10:50.832
Dong Li,

02:10:50.833 --> 02:10:51.833
use my gun.

02:10:57.583 --> 02:10:58.583
<i>Let him go!</i>

02:10:59.875 --> 02:11:01.250
There's no time to think!

02:11:12.542 --> 02:11:14.124
Dong Li,

02:11:14.125 --> 02:11:16.416
conquer the pressure.

02:11:16.417 --> 02:11:18.125
Xing Luo chose you for a reason.

02:11:19.667 --> 02:11:20.791
Captain,

02:11:20.792 --> 02:11:22.542
I'll take down the guy with Li Tong.

02:11:23.917 --> 02:11:25.125
I'm counting on you.

02:11:28.417 --> 02:11:30.917
Do it now! I'll kill her!

02:11:36.167 --> 02:11:37.374
Fuck!

02:11:37.375 --> 02:11:38.708
<i>Fucking Chinese!</i>

02:11:48.792 --> 02:11:51.749
We need the yellowcake for this war!

02:11:51.750 --> 02:11:54.625
To become stronger!

02:12:43.625 --> 02:12:45.583
<i>Captain, the rebels are behind us!</i>

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:02.374
Calm down!

02:13:02.375 --> 02:13:03.667
I'm from the Chinese military.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:06.500
Start the engine! Hurry up!

02:13:14.333 --> 02:13:15.708
Hurry!

02:14:00.708 --> 02:14:02.542
March forward!

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:11.542
Turn right!

02:14:26.125 --> 02:14:27.375
Attention!

02:14:35.792 --> 02:14:38.667
YU ZHUANG

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.917
TIAN-DE ZHANG

02:15:00.833 --> 02:15:02.125
Salute!

02:15:43.833 --> 02:15:46.582
<i>Attention! This is Chinese Navy.</i>

02:15:46.583 --> 02:15:48.832
<i>You're about to enter Chinese waters.</i>

02:15:48.833 --> 02:15:52.707
<i>Please turn around immediately!</i>

02:15:52.708 --> 02:15:55.707
<i>Attention! This is Chinese Navy.</i>

02:15:55.708 --> 02:15:58.374
<i>You're about to enter Chinese waters.</i>

02:15:58.375 --> 02:16:00.416
<i>Please turn around immediately!</i>

02:16:00.417 --> 02:16:01.666
<i>I repeat!</i>

02:16:01.667 --> 02:16:03.958
<i>Please turn around immediately!</i>
