I don't understand
why I can't do Thanksgiving

00:05.806 --> 00:07.339
at your house this year again.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.640
Dude, this is a totally

00:08.642 --> 00:09.975
codependent relationship,

00:09.977 --> 00:11.777
you need to have
your own life, man.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.244
I don't want to go
to my family's house.

00:13.246 --> 00:14.980
My mom's got that new
church she goes to

00:14.982 --> 00:16.482
where they're speaking
in tongues... it's weird.

00:16.484 --> 00:18.083
Dude.

00:18.085 --> 00:19.785
Oh, you packed your towels.
You packed your sex towels.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.987
Dude, they are not sex towels.
They are towels.

00:21.989 --> 00:23.755
They're a general
multipurpose tool.

00:23.757 --> 00:26.425
Oh, bullshit. I know
what those towels are for,

00:26.427 --> 00:28.059
and I also know
what I heard in there.

00:28.061 --> 00:30.429
That chick is assigned
to the most memorable ringtone

00:30.431 --> 00:31.830
this side of the Mason-Dixon,

00:31.832 --> 00:33.231
and I don't know
what's more pathetic...

00:33.233 --> 00:34.766
the fact that I know that

00:34.768 --> 00:36.234
or the fact that you never
changed it, you big dork.

00:36.236 --> 00:37.869
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.772
Road trippin'
with your ex, dude.

00:40.774 --> 00:44.376
Okay, and for two,
I don't reassign ringtones.

00:44.378 --> 00:45.777
Bullshit.
Yeah, you do.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.178
- No, I don't. No.
- Yeah, you do.

00:47.180 --> 00:48.880
So, you're saying
that if we stop being

00:48.882 --> 00:50.482
- best friend business partners...
- Whoa, BFBPs for life.

00:50.484 --> 00:53.619
That if I called
you ten years from now,

00:53.621 --> 00:57.323
I would still be
Elton John's Tiny Dancer.

00:57.325 --> 00:58.357
Yeah.

00:58.359 --> 01:00.025
Tight.

01:00.027 --> 01:01.259
♪ F O B D

01:03.631 --> 01:05.297
♪ F O B D

01:05.299 --> 01:06.898
Oh, I knew it, I knew it.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.500
Hey, you.

01:08.502 --> 01:11.503
Dude, her car broke down.
I would do it for anyone.

01:11.505 --> 01:14.773
Last time my car broke down,
you didn't do shit for me.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.808
- It's over, dude.
- Uh-huh.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.444
When are you gonna
propose to her?

01:18.446 --> 01:19.811
Damn it, Zach.

01:19.813 --> 01:21.313
You're actually gonna wait
five minutes

01:21.315 --> 01:23.214
after you see her,
so it's not complete desperate?

01:23.216 --> 01:24.683
Not gonna happen.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.217
Are you gonna, like,
get on top of your car?

01:26.219 --> 01:27.419
- No.
- Top of a hill?

01:27.421 --> 01:28.687
- No.
- People are always proposing

01:28.689 --> 01:30.055
on the top of things.

01:30.057 --> 01:31.957
Dude, I'm driving her up,
that is it.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.559
- Do you need a flash mob?
- No, I don't need a flash mob.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.461
- I can get you a flash mob.
- I do not need a flash mob.

01:36.897 --> 01:39.064
You drive away,
this is the end of all things.

01:39.066 --> 01:40.065
Okay, bye.

01:41.335 --> 01:44.903
Buddy, okay, I have
groomsman experience...

01:44.905 --> 01:46.974
specifically best man.

01:52.145 --> 01:53.246
Don't do this.

Shit!

03:03.317 --> 03:05.317
Hey.

03:05.319 --> 03:06.518
Hey.

04:19.392 --> 04:20.994
What?

04:22.330 --> 04:24.095
We're gonna have
to stop, like, 10 times

04:24.097 --> 04:27.699
before you finish that thing.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.468
- I know.
- I'm gonna set a lap timer.

04:29.470 --> 04:30.469
Shut up.

04:33.341 --> 04:36.575
Thank you, though.
Um, thank you for driving.

04:36.577 --> 04:37.711
It's cool.

04:43.417 --> 04:46.251
You've obviously been
reading those books

04:46.253 --> 04:47.986
that I got you...
that's really cool.

04:47.988 --> 04:51.590
Yeah, yeah, I mean, yeah,
I checked out...

04:51.592 --> 04:53.925
the...

04:53.927 --> 04:55.260
the one Wayne Dyer one.

04:55.262 --> 04:56.895
God, that book,
like, changed my life.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.897
I mean, it's
transformational, right?

04:58.899 --> 05:02.067
Uh, yeah, I mean...

05:02.069 --> 05:04.002
It's got some good
stuff in there.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.571
With your business,
it's totally thriving,

05:05.573 --> 05:07.205
are you doing those, like...

05:07.207 --> 05:09.741
are you doing the abundance
prayers or, like, the mantras?

05:09.743 --> 05:10.878
Um...

05:12.380 --> 05:15.246
Yeah, I mean,
I think it's more

05:15.248 --> 05:18.817
about just the work
that I'm actually putting in.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.920
Well, right, yeah, but I mean,
like, on a subconscious level,

05:21.922 --> 05:24.923
like, you're drawing
this success

05:24.925 --> 05:26.257
in this area towards yourself,

05:26.259 --> 05:28.460
like,
it's really inspiring and...

05:28.462 --> 05:30.228
Yeah, I'm thinking
about it, but...

05:30.230 --> 05:31.930
Yeah, but you're
thinking about it,

05:31.932 --> 05:35.100
and those beliefs are, like,
showing up in your life,

05:35.102 --> 05:36.768
I'm really proud of you.
That's awesome.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.370
Thank you.

05:38.372 --> 05:40.138
I've been doing a lot
of abundance work myself, too,

05:40.140 --> 05:42.474
so, like, I really feel
like soon, you know,

05:42.476 --> 05:44.042
something is gonna...

05:44.044 --> 05:45.277
Well, I mean,
at a certain point,

05:45.279 --> 05:46.945
you have to kind of be
results-oriented

05:46.947 --> 05:48.213
to work toward...

05:48.215 --> 05:51.184
like, actually work
toward a thing.

05:54.388 --> 05:55.654
Sorry.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.589
It's cool.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.259
You'll find something, Dais.

06:00.594 --> 06:01.960
I promise.

06:09.970 --> 06:13.372
- Do you need some help?
- No, I'm fine.

06:13.374 --> 06:16.942
- Okay, yeah, can you, please?
- Yeah.

06:16.944 --> 06:19.678
You want me to put
my hand in your pocket?

06:19.680 --> 06:22.213
Like, you want me to put this
hand in this, like, here?

06:22.215 --> 06:24.550
- Would you just...
- Is it in here?

06:24.552 --> 06:26.418
Yes.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.955
Okay.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.155
Um...

06:30.157 --> 06:31.623
"Hi, baby, can
you please pick up

06:31.625 --> 06:34.326
some extra pasta salad
and wine before you come?"

06:34.328 --> 06:35.226
Yep.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.562
Do you want me
to tell your mom

06:36.564 --> 06:38.530
that you're dropping
me off first?

06:41.369 --> 06:42.334
Oh.

06:42.336 --> 06:45.270
She still hates me.
Great.

06:45.272 --> 06:46.772
She doesn't hate you.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.707
I used to have these dreams

06:48.709 --> 06:50.208
that your family was Filipino,

06:50.210 --> 06:52.110
and your mom was asking me
to make a ceremonial tea

06:52.112 --> 06:54.946
in the kitchen by spitting
into a communal pot.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.849
My throat was so dry

06:57.851 --> 06:59.553
every time.

07:02.356 --> 07:03.324
Yeah.

07:07.561 --> 07:08.760
Don't be mean.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.161
Okay, okay.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.663
It was a lot of pressure.

07:11.665 --> 07:12.664
Okay.

07:12.666 --> 07:13.965
Sorry.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.867
She's a lot.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.405
She is.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.578
Do you want the rest of this?

07:25.846 --> 07:27.145
Yeah.

07:31.719 --> 07:33.218
Oh, my God.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.086
You got it, you got it.

07:35.088 --> 07:38.757
Yeah, a little more?
It's right there, yeah.

07:38.759 --> 07:39.893
Thank you.

07:43.431 --> 07:46.934
It's good, though,
seeing you, just...

07:48.402 --> 07:49.437
Being cool.

07:50.838 --> 07:51.972
Yeah.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.241
Yeah, cool.

07:59.647 --> 08:02.848
Okay, okay, slow down.
Slow down. Slow down.

08:02.850 --> 08:05.584
Oh, God, yeah.

08:09.222 --> 08:11.089
Hey, wait, what are you doing?

08:11.091 --> 08:12.458
Breathing it up my spine.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.395
Michael.

08:16.397 --> 08:18.364
Wait, Michael, Michael, I can't.

08:18.366 --> 08:20.966
Just look at me,
look at me in the eyes.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.603
- You can look at me, baby.
- Please, no.

08:24.372 --> 08:27.005
Oh, my God.

08:35.616 --> 08:38.085
I said slow down.

08:45.593 --> 08:47.295
That was necessary.

08:48.562 --> 08:51.763
Totally necessary.
Are you kidding?

08:51.765 --> 08:54.500
Oh, God, it's everywhere.

08:54.502 --> 08:56.067
Oh, fuck.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.203
Oh, it better not be
on my pants.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.507
I have towels.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.925
Okay, no, I got it.
Yeah.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.423
Okay, there she is.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.460
Hey, Mom. Hi.

09:54.462 --> 09:59.197
Oh, my gosh, look who it is.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.767
Oh, come here.

10:01.769 --> 10:03.234
Hi, Donna.

10:03.236 --> 10:04.603
Come here.

10:04.605 --> 10:07.005
Happy Thanksgiving.

10:07.007 --> 10:11.443
It's been six months
since I saw you, oh, my gosh,

10:11.445 --> 10:13.345
and you didn't say a thing.

10:13.347 --> 10:16.081
Mom, he just drove me up.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.716
Oh, well, that's great.

10:17.718 --> 10:20.218
Well, come on in.
What are you waiting for?

10:20.220 --> 10:22.421
Honey, come on.

10:22.423 --> 10:24.390
Oh, I've got so much to cook.

10:24.392 --> 10:26.325
Got the greatest food.
You're gonna love it.

10:26.327 --> 10:28.494
See who's here.

10:28.496 --> 10:31.229
Michael, hey, I didn't
know you were coming.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.331
Did you know he was coming?

10:32.333 --> 10:33.699
Precious.

10:33.701 --> 10:35.200
Hi, Grandpa.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.968
Hey, you said you
were coming yesterday.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.570
- I know. I'm sorry.
- I've been looking at your

10:38.572 --> 10:39.938
Facebook post.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.873
I've even applied
for your video game's beta.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.108
You what?

10:43.110 --> 10:44.610
I used to play "Oregon Trail."

10:46.447 --> 10:47.979
Seriously,
I'm really proud of you,

10:47.981 --> 10:50.015
I think it's terrific
what you're doing.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.383
So tell me about this startup.

10:51.385 --> 10:53.652
You got some momentum.
You have the financing.

10:53.654 --> 10:54.786
What's going on?

10:54.788 --> 10:55.787
Um, yeah.

10:55.789 --> 10:58.724
We, uh... we got it, actually.

10:58.726 --> 11:00.258
Well, I...

11:00.260 --> 11:03.329
That's awesome.
My dad cut...

11:03.331 --> 11:05.931
This is cause for celebration.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.666
How about some sparkling cider?

11:07.668 --> 11:11.403
No, no, I got to drive.
I can't get too crazy.

11:11.405 --> 11:12.904
That's not funny.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.706
Dad, seriously?

11:14.708 --> 11:17.108
Daisy, I'm so happy
you got the time off,

11:17.110 --> 11:18.644
I knew you would, honey.

11:18.646 --> 11:20.912
Here you go.

11:20.914 --> 11:24.115
I'll have it later.
I got to change and wash off.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.451
Okay.

11:25.453 --> 11:29.187
Well, wait, your dad
broke the sink knob,

11:29.189 --> 11:31.523
so I put a wrench
in there for you.

11:31.525 --> 11:34.426
Come on, I'll show
you how it works.

11:34.428 --> 11:37.298
- I'll take your bags up.
- Thanks.

11:41.702 --> 11:46.405
So you just take hold of this,
give it a turn,

11:46.407 --> 11:47.773
and turn it that way.

11:47.775 --> 11:49.142
That's great.

11:50.578 --> 11:51.377
Ta-da!

11:51.379 --> 11:53.747
You got it, no problem.

11:56.750 --> 11:57.983
See you later.

11:57.985 --> 12:00.354
Thanks, Grandpa.

12:06.694 --> 12:07.859
Hey.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.160
- Hey, Liz.
- Hi.

12:09.162 --> 12:11.129
- Oh, no, what happened?
- I know.

12:11.131 --> 12:12.130
Skiing.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.732
Oh...

12:13.734 --> 12:14.866
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.968
- She's still in the bathroom?
- Yeah.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.938
It's really good
to see you guys together...

12:19.940 --> 12:22.173
or whatever it is.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.109
Sorry.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.210
That's fine.

12:25.212 --> 12:26.712
That's fine.

12:26.714 --> 12:28.181
Yeah.

12:29.417 --> 12:30.816
No, we, um...

12:30.818 --> 12:33.685
we saw each other last week
by accident.

12:33.687 --> 12:36.488
I was in a coffee shop
and looked up from my laptop

12:36.490 --> 12:38.790
and nearly had a heart attack.

12:40.394 --> 12:42.394
And then her car's
radiator blew up.

12:42.396 --> 12:44.396
Of course.
Of course.

12:44.398 --> 12:47.699
So she called me
about coming up and...

12:47.701 --> 12:49.868
There you go.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.337
Yeah.

12:51.339 --> 12:53.305
But I know where I am,
you know?

12:53.307 --> 12:56.174
It's like the last
time we talk about this shit...

12:56.176 --> 12:58.379
Hey, guys.

12:59.480 --> 13:01.613
- Hi.
- Hey.

13:01.615 --> 13:02.648
Um...

13:02.650 --> 13:05.586
I'll see you guys
back downstairs.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.166
It's freezing.

13:21.168 --> 13:22.670
I know.

13:27.541 --> 13:29.242
Hey, that's okay.

13:58.439 --> 14:00.972
This place turns me 15 again.

14:03.577 --> 14:05.746
I always liked your room.

14:07.315 --> 14:09.281
My room in Cambodia was
bare walls.

14:09.283 --> 14:11.251
I was never home.

14:12.486 --> 14:13.987
I miss my students.

14:15.289 --> 14:17.689
Here, I'm always the kid.

14:17.691 --> 14:20.761
You look pretty
grown up to me.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.833
You know what I found
the other day?

14:27.835 --> 14:29.568
Hmm?

14:29.570 --> 14:32.371
Your Boba Fett toothbrush.

14:32.373 --> 14:35.441
You kept that?

14:35.443 --> 14:37.309
I put it in my "us" box

14:37.311 --> 14:40.812
with all of your
sweet little things.

14:40.814 --> 14:43.915
I still have
that wack painting

14:43.917 --> 14:46.318
you made of me
on our mushroom trip.

14:49.056 --> 14:49.990
Never again.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.394
You needed it.

14:55.796 --> 14:58.163
I didn't realize it then,
but I came up with the name

14:58.165 --> 15:00.734
for my company that night.

15:02.403 --> 15:04.102
I'm so freaking proud of you.

15:07.908 --> 15:11.612
I don't know how to tell you
just how good that is to hear.

15:13.847 --> 15:14.982
I love you.

15:23.991 --> 15:27.428
You can't be saying
shit like that.

15:32.833 --> 15:33.801
Why?

15:36.169 --> 15:37.736
Why is there this unwritten rule

15:37.738 --> 15:39.705
that you're allowed
to be honest, but I'm not?

15:39.707 --> 15:41.809
I still think
about us sometimes, okay?

15:43.644 --> 15:47.713
And I know it's black and white
for you, and...

15:47.715 --> 15:50.384
I understand why,
but it's, um...

15:51.585 --> 15:53.887
It's not like that for me.

15:55.389 --> 15:58.390
But if it's not
serious for you...

16:01.028 --> 16:04.097
I don't think we'd be here again
if it wasn't serious.

16:08.302 --> 16:10.804
If we ever got back together...

16:12.540 --> 16:15.274
That would have to be it,

16:15.276 --> 16:17.042
like, 100% it,

16:17.044 --> 16:20.414
and if that's
not where you're at...

16:24.217 --> 16:26.818
If there's one thing
you taught me

16:26.820 --> 16:30.289
is that I deserve
to be happy in my job,

16:30.291 --> 16:33.725
and I don't know where
or what that's gonna be,

16:33.727 --> 16:36.428
but that doesn't mean

16:36.430 --> 16:38.566
that I don't love you...

16:40.100 --> 16:44.836
Or that I don't see us
ending up together.

16:44.838 --> 16:47.373
I know I can't ask you
to wait for me, but...

16:47.375 --> 16:49.009
You are, though.

17:01.455 --> 17:02.654
Happy Thanksgiving.

17:02.656 --> 17:05.156
Yeah, Happy Thanksgiving.

17:57.778 --> 17:59.077
Hey, little baby boy!

17:59.079 --> 18:01.613
There he is!
Oh, I missed you so much!

18:01.615 --> 18:03.815
- Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
- Hey, hey, get in here.

18:03.817 --> 18:05.451
Look at this guy.
Welcome home.

18:05.453 --> 18:06.885
Sweetie, you are
late, late, late.

18:06.887 --> 18:08.987
- Sorry, sorry.
- It's okay, it's okay.

18:08.989 --> 18:09.821
Oh, good.

18:09.823 --> 18:11.022
Oh, what is this now?

18:11.024 --> 18:13.425
- What?
- Nothing, nothing.

18:13.427 --> 18:14.860
We'll put this in the fridge
or something.

18:14.862 --> 18:15.927
No, no, no, you
handle this, honey.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.463
Michael's got to go freshen up.

18:17.465 --> 18:19.731
You have a clean shirt?
Company's already sitting down.

18:19.733 --> 18:21.500
- Company?
- Yeah.

18:21.502 --> 18:23.702
Hi, sweetie.

18:23.704 --> 18:24.870
- Do you remember me?
- Ana.

18:24.872 --> 18:27.272
- Yeah. Hi.
- Yeah. Hi.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.507
Oh, my goodness.

18:28.509 --> 18:30.241
Ele, he's grown up
so handsome.

18:30.243 --> 18:33.579
Isn't he, though?
Look at that face.

18:33.581 --> 18:34.882
Hi.

18:35.749 --> 18:37.551
Oh, get over here.

18:38.452 --> 18:40.654
This is my daughter, Samira.

18:42.590 --> 18:43.589
Michael, say hello.

18:43.591 --> 18:45.924
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:45.926 --> 18:49.595
So Ana's your mom?
You're her daughter?

18:49.597 --> 18:50.731
Yeah.

18:51.932 --> 18:53.732
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

18:55.736 --> 18:57.503
You know, she went
to Casitas High.

18:57.505 --> 19:00.339
You guys could've met in
marching band, for all you know.

19:00.341 --> 19:01.940
Wow. Huh.

19:03.744 --> 19:06.312
You look great.

19:06.314 --> 19:08.246
All right, who's thirsty?

19:08.248 --> 19:11.583
I got a Chateau La Gaffeliere
Saint-Emilion 2010.

19:11.585 --> 19:12.918
Michael, you know the bottle.

19:12.920 --> 19:14.986
No, no, no,
he's driven for hours.

19:14.988 --> 19:18.524
Michael, go upstairs and wash
that road trip off of you.

19:18.526 --> 19:19.825
I don't need to shower.

19:19.827 --> 19:21.226
Well, at least change
your shirt.

19:21.228 --> 19:23.161
Why? It's just gonna
get covered in crap.

19:23.163 --> 19:26.332
Michael, just look nice.
Change your shirt.

19:26.334 --> 19:27.968
Don't bust my ass.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.770
Spending time with Michael...

19:31.772 --> 19:33.672
what's going on there?

19:33.674 --> 19:35.441
I-I don't know.

19:35.443 --> 19:37.142
I mean, it's confusing

19:37.144 --> 19:39.611
being in his energy,
you know, but...

19:39.613 --> 19:41.146
It's crazy, Mom.

19:41.148 --> 19:43.014
I'm more myself with him
than I am with anyone else.

19:43.016 --> 19:44.550
You know, honey,
I think you two

19:44.552 --> 19:47.519
just need to go to therapy
and work these things out.

19:47.521 --> 19:48.987
Mom...

19:48.989 --> 19:50.622
Well, you two were talking
marriage at one point.

19:50.624 --> 19:51.957
There's clearly something there.

19:51.959 --> 19:54.826
He's not going
to therapy with me.

19:54.828 --> 19:57.030
Well, exes go to therapy.

19:57.965 --> 19:59.931
I think he wants this to work.

19:59.933 --> 20:02.534
Why else would he offer
to drive you up?

20:02.536 --> 20:05.537
He just wanted to see if you
were in a different place,

20:05.539 --> 20:07.473
which you are.

20:07.475 --> 20:10.108
You've got a career,

20:10.110 --> 20:12.210
your own place.

20:12.212 --> 20:14.014
You want it to work?

20:15.749 --> 20:17.117
Yeah.

20:19.186 --> 20:20.319
But...

20:20.321 --> 20:21.687
Dais...

20:21.689 --> 20:24.323
there will always be a "but."

20:24.325 --> 20:27.659
You just got to shut
the "but" up.

20:31.499 --> 20:34.300
You look so sharp.

20:34.302 --> 20:35.634
What is going on here?

20:35.636 --> 20:37.168
Oh, don't be so angry.

20:37.170 --> 20:39.638
I was gonna tell you,
but you were late.

20:39.640 --> 20:41.640
You should've told me
what I'm stepping into.

20:41.642 --> 20:42.908
What are you stepping into?

20:42.910 --> 20:44.610
An arranged marriage!

20:44.612 --> 20:47.045
Don't be so dramatic.
It's just dinner.

20:47.047 --> 20:49.481
I mean, they're
practically family anyway.

20:49.483 --> 20:50.784
Oh, honey.

20:51.785 --> 20:53.084
It's been almost five months

20:53.086 --> 20:54.520
since you and Daisy
broke things off,

20:54.522 --> 20:57.656
and I've barely heard
a peep out of you since.

20:57.658 --> 21:02.227
And I know you must've been
so lonely down in LA, but...

21:02.229 --> 21:04.563
I just didn't know what to do.

21:04.565 --> 21:07.966
And maybe it was pushy, maybe
you weren't ready, I get it,

21:07.968 --> 21:10.702
but I'm not forcing anything
here anymore, I promise.

21:10.704 --> 21:12.338
I mean,
Ana's daughter's in town,

21:12.340 --> 21:13.839
so she came, that's all.

21:13.841 --> 21:15.474
You don't have to be
ready for anything.

21:15.476 --> 21:17.809
- What did you tell her mother?
- I told her you were ready.

21:17.811 --> 21:19.978
- Mom!
- Oh, all right.

21:19.980 --> 21:22.514
I wanted her to come, okay?
You need to socialize.

21:22.516 --> 21:24.550
Girls your age are supposed
to be thinking

21:24.552 --> 21:26.084
about the bigger picture.

21:26.086 --> 21:28.922
I want to show you something.

21:35.563 --> 21:37.429
Oh...

21:37.431 --> 21:39.731
This is Bubbe's ring.

21:39.733 --> 21:41.533
I had it polished.

21:41.535 --> 21:44.303
This is for you
and your future wife one day,

21:44.305 --> 21:46.372
whomever she may be.

21:46.374 --> 21:48.006
This is so...

21:48.008 --> 21:49.875
Okay, go ahead, be angry.

21:49.877 --> 21:51.877
Tell your father
it's all my fault, as usual,

21:51.879 --> 21:55.113
but later on when you're happy,
I want credit for that, too.

21:55.115 --> 21:58.218
Now, go grab the carving knife,
be yourself.

22:03.957 --> 22:06.024
- Your mom is always...
- Mom!

22:06.026 --> 22:08.560
Samira, honey,
you haven't touched your turkey.

22:08.562 --> 22:10.396
Oh, dear God, don't tell me
you're vegetarian.

22:10.398 --> 22:11.997
- No.
- Oh, no, no, no.

22:11.999 --> 22:14.700
- Oh, I would've had a stroke.
- Me too.

22:14.702 --> 22:16.902
Michael, did I tell you Samira

22:16.904 --> 22:19.938
just got her
master's in biotech?

22:19.940 --> 22:22.574
Oh, yeah, that's cool.

22:22.576 --> 22:23.842
And she teaches at Rutgers.

22:23.844 --> 22:25.210
What do you teach,
again, honey?

22:25.212 --> 22:28.113
Oh, I'm a lecturer,
not a professor...

22:28.115 --> 22:31.950
epidemiology, research and
statistics, and biostatistics.

22:31.952 --> 22:33.752
Is that all?

22:35.289 --> 22:36.988
No.

22:36.990 --> 22:38.590
What else do you do?

22:38.592 --> 22:42.294
Well, I have extracted a DNA
strand from a plant before.

22:42.296 --> 22:44.663
I mean, I extract DNA
on the regular,

22:44.665 --> 22:46.231
I rip that shit like DVDs, yo.

22:46.233 --> 22:49.801
I find these mosquitoes
fossilized in tree sap, and bam!

22:49.803 --> 22:52.103
I make dinosaurs
out of that shit.

22:52.105 --> 22:53.739
What the hell
are you talking about?

22:53.741 --> 22:55.507
"Jurassic Park."

22:55.509 --> 22:57.443
Oh!

22:57.445 --> 22:59.110
You kids are sugar high.

22:59.112 --> 23:00.512
All right,
who wants more of this?

23:00.514 --> 23:01.480
I'm good, honey.

23:01.482 --> 23:03.048
Michael, scooch over.

23:03.050 --> 23:06.452
Scooch over.
Just scooch over.

23:06.454 --> 23:07.486
Oh, Dad.

23:07.488 --> 23:09.187
Hey, Pops,
pass the yams, please.

23:09.189 --> 23:11.056
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks. That was funny.

23:11.058 --> 23:12.358
Ooh, "pass" is one of his words.

23:12.360 --> 23:14.826
Whoa, whoa, Liz!

23:14.828 --> 23:16.227
Okay, there.

23:16.229 --> 23:18.163
She loves that game,
I'll tell you.

23:18.165 --> 23:19.598
Hey, why didn't Michael stay?

23:19.600 --> 23:21.467
I didn't push too hard,
honey, did I?

23:21.469 --> 23:22.901
Daddy...

23:22.903 --> 23:25.270
You know, I just... I hadn't
spoken to him in a while,

23:25.272 --> 23:27.138
and I thought
he was gonna stick around.

23:27.140 --> 23:29.708
I think your
father has a crush.

23:29.710 --> 23:33.745
It's his hair.
He has such attractive hair.

23:34.782 --> 23:35.881
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

23:35.883 --> 23:37.783
Oh, you know what?

23:37.785 --> 23:39.818
I'm gonna be in LA before I go,

23:39.820 --> 23:41.653
and I'd love to see
you and Michael.

23:41.655 --> 23:44.923
Yeah, that would be great,
wouldn't it?

23:44.925 --> 23:47.258
Honey, you're doing
everything right.

23:47.260 --> 23:50.896
We're gonna back off.
Whatever happens happens.

23:50.898 --> 23:53.031
That's your answer
for everything.

23:53.033 --> 23:54.966
If she loves the guy,
why should they wait?

23:54.968 --> 23:56.702
Dad, it's a timing thing.

23:56.704 --> 24:00.439
Same reason that we still
don't have a Christmas tree.

24:00.441 --> 24:02.274
Every year
you wait too damn long,

24:02.276 --> 24:05.110
and we end up
with a broken plastic one.

24:05.112 --> 24:07.112
Wallace, we're gonna
get one tomorrow.

24:07.114 --> 24:09.483
Daisy's gonna take you, okay?

24:10.518 --> 24:12.851
Listen, don't wait.

24:12.853 --> 24:16.187
Otherwise some floozy's
gonna cozy up with this guy,

24:16.189 --> 24:18.757
and you'll be stuck wondering
whatever happened

24:18.759 --> 24:21.226
to that perfect timing of yours.

24:21.228 --> 24:23.228
What do you do in LA?

24:23.230 --> 24:25.897
Uh, I'm in level design at a
video game studio...

24:25.899 --> 24:27.333
Juggernauts.

24:27.335 --> 24:28.600
Oh.

24:28.602 --> 24:30.035
Oh, but your mom said
you had your own company.

24:30.037 --> 24:31.537
Oh, he does.

24:31.539 --> 24:34.072
It's early stages.
I still need the day job.

24:34.074 --> 24:35.407
A few buddies and I have
raised some seed money

24:35.409 --> 24:37.208
to start our own game company.

24:37.210 --> 24:38.877
Yeah, when are we gonna see

24:38.879 --> 24:41.613
the fruits
of our investment here?

24:41.615 --> 24:43.582
Um...

24:43.584 --> 24:47.386
Well, I say, you have a company,
you are a CEO.

24:47.388 --> 24:49.187
Now you're just
negotiating your fee.

24:49.189 --> 24:51.623
Oh, I love you.
I love the way you said that.

24:51.625 --> 24:54.159
She is so right, honey.
You really have to own it.

24:54.161 --> 24:57.062
Reintroduce yourself as a CEO,
a big macher.

24:57.064 --> 24:58.797
- Mom.
- What?

24:58.799 --> 25:00.265
CEO.

25:00.267 --> 25:03.302
You tech bubble nuts
are obsessed with titles.

25:03.304 --> 25:05.571
You know what a joke it
is when some banana-head

25:05.573 --> 25:09.207
in a basement operation is
handing out cards that say CEO?

25:09.209 --> 25:11.910
Okay, enough business.
It's Thanksgiving.

25:11.912 --> 25:13.745
Samira,
what do you need, honey?

25:13.747 --> 25:15.547
Michael, give it to her.

25:15.549 --> 25:17.483
Let me tell you a story.

25:17.485 --> 25:19.451
- When I was younger than you...
- Mm-hmm.

25:19.453 --> 25:23.822
I met your grandmother,
the love of my life,

25:23.824 --> 25:25.391
and every night we would meet

25:25.393 --> 25:27.459
in her father's
strawberry fields, and we'd...

25:27.461 --> 25:29.295
- Fast forward.
- Okay, stop there.

25:29.297 --> 25:31.363
- All right, all right.
- What would you do?

25:31.365 --> 25:33.299
Oh, no, no, no, all right,
the point is...

25:33.301 --> 25:37.936
Now, listen, the point is
I didn't have a job,

25:37.938 --> 25:40.606
and her father hated my guts.

25:40.608 --> 25:43.309
Oh, do you think
that was gonna stop me?

25:43.311 --> 25:44.612
Oh, no.

25:47.848 --> 25:51.683
Hey, everybody,
grab your drinks.

25:51.685 --> 25:52.984
I just want to say

25:52.986 --> 25:56.187
how proud I am
of our little precious.

25:56.189 --> 25:59.325
One whole year at your first
writing job.

25:59.327 --> 26:00.759
- Yeah.
- Let's hear it.

26:00.761 --> 26:02.694
Yay.
Congratulations, honey.

26:02.696 --> 26:03.964
Yeah, honey.

26:05.499 --> 26:08.900
If you're ever gonna focus
on your own career, Dais,

26:08.902 --> 26:11.169
now is the time.

26:11.171 --> 26:12.804
Totally.
You know what?

26:12.806 --> 26:14.039
I never would've considered

26:14.041 --> 26:15.507
the promotion
at the Stockholm office

26:15.509 --> 26:17.309
if I hadn't broken up
with Jason.

26:17.311 --> 26:20.011
And last year was
the best year of my life.

26:20.013 --> 26:21.647
Yeah.

26:21.649 --> 26:23.815
Maybe that's something
you can only do alone.

26:23.817 --> 26:27.018
So what's the game
you're working on right now?

26:27.020 --> 26:29.721
Um, it's called
"Hunter Gatherer."

26:29.723 --> 26:31.156
Okay.

26:31.158 --> 26:34.593
It's a strategy game
like "Starcraft"...

26:34.595 --> 26:36.928
"Age of Empires."

26:36.930 --> 26:38.530
Never mind,

26:38.532 --> 26:41.600
I can tell this is all immensely
fascinating to everyone.

26:41.602 --> 26:42.634
Oh, it is to me.

26:42.636 --> 26:44.303
Yeah, it's cool that you care.

26:44.305 --> 26:46.037
There's still
lots to work out.

26:46.039 --> 26:48.006
It's tough with the day job.

26:48.008 --> 26:49.207
Not a hobby anymore.

26:49.209 --> 26:50.809
You're taking people's money.

26:50.811 --> 26:52.878
You owe them a product on time.

26:52.880 --> 26:56.282
I know, but it has to be
good first, or no one will care.

26:56.284 --> 26:57.716
Where's the monetization plan

26:57.718 --> 26:59.585
you said you were gonna
run by me three weeks ago?

26:59.587 --> 27:01.186
We're not at that phase, Dad.

27:01.188 --> 27:02.721
The timeline I signed off,

27:02.723 --> 27:05.491
that was
this month's deliverable.

27:05.493 --> 27:07.192
When they
start talking about work,

27:07.194 --> 27:09.295
it's like they're
on another planet.

27:09.297 --> 27:10.796
Nathan, enough
with the big words.

27:10.798 --> 27:12.731
Okay, let's just change
the conversation, please.

27:12.733 --> 27:14.366
All right, all right,
let's forget it.

27:14.368 --> 27:16.001
I forgot I'm talking
to a creative here.

27:16.003 --> 27:17.068
What...

27:17.070 --> 27:18.937
Samira, can you
pass the turkey?

27:18.939 --> 27:20.205
Dark meat, please.

27:20.207 --> 27:22.474
No more dark meat.
He's had enough.

27:22.476 --> 27:24.376
Can you stop running my life
for five minutes?

27:24.378 --> 27:25.844
My hand to God, Nathan,

27:25.846 --> 27:27.513
you make a scene,
I will kill you in your sleep.

27:27.515 --> 27:28.914
I mean, it's always
a power struggle.

27:28.916 --> 27:30.282
Like, if push came to shove,

27:30.284 --> 27:32.351
would you have ever moved
for Michael?

27:32.353 --> 27:34.553
I mean, technically, I did.

27:34.555 --> 27:38.256
I came back home instead of
renewing my teaching contract.

27:38.258 --> 27:39.891
See, exactly.

27:39.893 --> 27:42.461
It's not like Michael
would've ever moved for you.

27:42.463 --> 27:45.364
I bet you wish
you hadn't come back, right?

27:45.366 --> 27:48.502
'Cause that job was,
like, really your thing.

27:50.671 --> 27:52.137
Yeah.

27:52.139 --> 27:54.174
Yeah, I loved that job.

27:57.278 --> 27:59.278
I've been looking again,
actually.

27:59.280 --> 28:00.679
- What?
- Hmm?

28:00.681 --> 28:03.482
My friend sent me this link
to an NGO in China.

28:03.484 --> 28:05.384
Could be this really amazing
opportunity working with kids.

28:05.386 --> 28:06.952
Whoa, hold on a second.

28:06.954 --> 28:09.321
Daisy, I thought we were feeling
good about this direction.

28:09.323 --> 28:12.324
I mean, you're
getting paid to write.

28:12.326 --> 28:14.993
Well, she's an Aries, so...

28:14.995 --> 28:16.495
What's that mean?

28:16.497 --> 28:18.129
You guys bore easily.

28:19.633 --> 28:22.501
Oh, I'm... I'm not bored.
I just...

28:22.503 --> 28:24.603
It'd be nice to have a job
that means something.

28:24.605 --> 28:27.138
Your job does mean
something, honey.

28:27.140 --> 28:28.574
I mean,
people need to buy things.

28:28.576 --> 28:31.109
You inform them
in really fun ways.

28:31.111 --> 28:32.444
Hey, guess what.
I quit.

28:32.446 --> 28:34.480
- What?
- When?

28:34.482 --> 28:36.482
Um, the reason
I got the time off

28:36.484 --> 28:38.484
is because I quit, actually.

28:38.486 --> 28:40.886
- Honey, when did this happen?
- Last month.

28:40.888 --> 28:44.690
Christmas is such a hard time
to look for a job, Dais.

28:44.692 --> 28:47.025
Yeah, thanks.

28:47.027 --> 28:48.527
Sorry.

28:48.529 --> 28:49.861
So...

28:49.863 --> 28:51.262
what now?

28:51.264 --> 28:52.898
I don't know.

28:52.900 --> 28:54.500
You know, I'm just looking
around for what feels right.

28:54.502 --> 28:57.669
Oh, sweetie, I missed you
so much last time.

28:57.671 --> 29:00.606
You know, maybe we could just
find some Chinese kids here.

29:00.608 --> 29:03.309
- Mom.
- Hey, you know what?

29:03.311 --> 29:05.176
It's all gonna be fine.

29:05.178 --> 29:07.713
We're gonna figure this out.

29:07.715 --> 29:09.481
What are you gonna do
about Michael, though?

29:09.483 --> 29:12.017
I-I don't know, Liz.

29:12.019 --> 29:13.419
We're...

29:13.421 --> 29:15.789
we're not even
officially together.

29:20.561 --> 29:21.760
Awesome.

29:21.762 --> 29:24.496
So I don't know
what I'm gonna do yet,

29:24.498 --> 29:26.197
but I don't want us
to figure it out, Dad.

29:26.199 --> 29:29.267
I want to figure it out, so...

29:34.742 --> 29:36.742
Cheers.

29:55.896 --> 29:57.264
Hey.

30:03.937 --> 30:08.940
You got anymore
Chateau La-whatever 2010?

30:12.413 --> 30:14.382
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

30:16.817 --> 30:17.918
Look at him.

30:20.754 --> 30:24.390
I always marveled at how happy
he looks when he sleeps.

30:24.392 --> 30:27.561
I don't see it often
when he's awake.

30:29.997 --> 30:31.399
You still heated?

30:33.434 --> 30:35.767
Sorry about that.

30:35.769 --> 30:38.670
I understand the need
to impress your parents.

30:38.672 --> 30:40.238
Oh...

30:40.240 --> 30:43.975
I've kind of accepted
that's not gonna happen.

30:43.977 --> 30:45.777
I mean, my...

30:45.779 --> 30:49.515
my grandfather survived
a Middle Eastern revolution,

30:49.517 --> 30:53.885
and I have the high score
on "Ms. Pac-Man"

30:53.887 --> 30:55.253
at the Nicholson Arcade.

30:55.255 --> 31:00.326
Wow. You really try to
impress a girl, don't you?

31:00.328 --> 31:03.194
I'm not trying
to impress anyone.

31:03.196 --> 31:04.463
Right.

31:04.465 --> 31:06.365
How could you?

31:06.367 --> 31:08.900
You don't even know my type.

31:12.272 --> 31:13.407
Okay.

31:15.108 --> 31:16.310
What?

31:19.613 --> 31:21.415
What's your type?

31:22.516 --> 31:23.782
I don't have a type.

31:23.784 --> 31:25.851
Don't believe in types.

31:25.853 --> 31:27.118
Jeez, okay.

31:27.120 --> 31:30.856
I just found
that what people respond to

31:30.858 --> 31:32.658
and what they say
they respond to

31:32.660 --> 31:35.126
can be very different.

31:35.128 --> 31:38.330
I would say I respond
to women

31:38.332 --> 31:41.333
who have...

31:41.335 --> 31:43.502
huge Adam's apples

31:43.504 --> 31:46.538
- and padded pantsuits...
- Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.

31:46.540 --> 31:48.374
And have names like Bath Shiva.

31:48.376 --> 31:49.741
- Traditional.
- Yeah.

31:49.743 --> 31:50.542
I like it.

31:50.544 --> 31:51.977
Oh, my God, I do, too,

31:51.979 --> 31:54.346
which is why
I remain regrettably single.

31:54.348 --> 31:56.682
- Aw.

31:56.684 --> 32:00.087
Drink up.

32:14.968 --> 32:16.870
You okay, precious?

32:18.439 --> 32:20.841
What, you're not
precious anymore?

32:22.209 --> 32:23.977
What's up, Dad?

32:26.780 --> 32:29.681
Look, about this job thing,

32:29.683 --> 32:31.383
I'm sorry
if I put pressure on you

32:31.385 --> 32:33.354
to come up here this weekend.

32:35.222 --> 32:36.822
It's not your fault.

32:36.824 --> 32:39.658
I probably would've had
to quit eventually.

32:39.660 --> 32:43.228
I just... I wish you would've
talked to me about it.

32:43.230 --> 32:44.698
I know.

32:45.633 --> 32:47.032
You know what?

32:47.034 --> 32:49.100
Maybe it was a good thing
you lost this job.

32:49.102 --> 32:51.770
I didn't get fired.

32:51.772 --> 32:52.773
No.

32:56.310 --> 32:59.411
But we manifest everything
in our lives at some level.

32:59.413 --> 33:02.414
Isn't that
what you always tell me?

33:02.416 --> 33:03.782
Yeah.

33:03.784 --> 33:06.251
I mean, look,
you're 25 years old now.

33:06.253 --> 33:08.253
I'm 26.

33:08.255 --> 33:09.588
That's what I meant.

33:11.292 --> 33:13.459
Look, you want to strike oil,

33:13.461 --> 33:17.028
why don't you just dig deep
right here where God's put you,

33:17.030 --> 33:21.300
instead of running all over
the world poking little holes?

33:21.302 --> 33:22.536
I want to show you something.

33:38.986 --> 33:41.086
Oh...

33:41.088 --> 33:43.889
Oh, my gosh.

33:43.891 --> 33:48.794
When I took that job in Dallas,
it was my dream job.

33:48.796 --> 33:50.896
You were four years old,

33:50.898 --> 33:52.631
and I would fly home
every other weekend,

33:52.633 --> 33:53.832
and I think I'd miss you

33:53.834 --> 33:57.202
grow two inches
each and every time.

33:57.204 --> 33:59.638
Then one day...

33:59.640 --> 34:02.641
I came home to this.

34:02.643 --> 34:04.778
My life-size dad.

34:07.415 --> 34:08.880
You said you drew it

34:08.882 --> 34:12.984
so you could see my face
anytime you wanted.

34:12.985 --> 34:15.521
I've never been
more miserable in a job

34:15.523 --> 34:17.188
after seeing this drawing.

34:19.493 --> 34:20.659
Dad...

34:20.661 --> 34:24.062
Oh...

34:24.063 --> 34:25.364
It's okay.

34:25.366 --> 34:26.665
Oh, gosh.

34:26.667 --> 34:30.034
Oh, my gosh.

34:36.844 --> 34:40.346
Might I offer you
Trader Joe's best?

34:40.348 --> 34:41.513
Inspired.

34:41.514 --> 34:42.648
Oh, thank you.

34:42.650 --> 34:43.949
I have great taste in employees

34:43.951 --> 34:46.117
who have great taste
in Trader Joe's.

34:48.054 --> 34:50.021
So the, um...

34:50.023 --> 34:53.159
the "pulling DNA from plants"
thing...

34:54.328 --> 34:55.494
What is that for?

34:55.496 --> 34:57.329
Oh, that was in school.

34:57.331 --> 34:59.765
I don't really work
in a lab anymore.

34:59.767 --> 35:03.769
The research I do now focuses
on infant development.

35:03.771 --> 35:06.204
How did you get into that?

35:06.206 --> 35:07.906
A close family friend
when I was young

35:07.908 --> 35:10.909
had a baby
with underdeveloped lungs,

35:10.911 --> 35:13.812
I always knew I wanted to help
ever since then.

35:13.814 --> 35:17.182
Man, that is what
I'm talking about.

35:17.184 --> 35:20.552
I mean, I have known what I want
to do forever,

35:20.554 --> 35:22.153
it feels like.

35:22.155 --> 35:25.090
Most of my friends
do not know what they want.

35:25.092 --> 35:26.525
I...

35:26.527 --> 35:28.026
I have a hard time
relating to people

35:28.028 --> 35:29.728
who are still figuring it out.

35:29.730 --> 35:31.062
I know that's mean,

35:31.064 --> 35:33.399
but I'm solution-oriented,
you know?

35:33.401 --> 35:35.401
- Mm.
- Like, do something.

35:35.403 --> 35:37.903
- Try something.
- Mm-hmm.

35:37.905 --> 35:40.739
I mean, accomplishing it
is a whole nother thing.

35:40.741 --> 35:44.510
Yeah, sometimes I think
that I'll probably die

35:44.512 --> 35:48.480
before any of the problems
I want to solve get solved.

35:48.482 --> 35:50.649
Like, if two people
love each other

35:50.651 --> 35:52.884
and their kid
would have autism,

35:52.886 --> 35:55.721
we should be able to fix that.

35:55.723 --> 35:59.425
Fix it like doctor
the genes of the kid?

35:59.427 --> 36:01.192
Mm, you're one of those?

36:01.194 --> 36:03.495
Like I'm playing God
or something.

36:03.497 --> 36:06.231
No, no, I'm not one of those,

36:06.233 --> 36:10.035
but you were so preoccupied
with whether or not you could,

36:10.037 --> 36:14.205
you didn't you stop to think
about whether or not you should?

36:14.207 --> 36:15.807
Was that... Oh.

36:15.809 --> 36:17.843
Jeff Goldblum, "Jurassic Park."

36:17.845 --> 36:21.246
They're, like, sitting around
the table, and he's like...

36:21.248 --> 36:24.215
"Uh-huh." Like, "Ah..."

36:24.217 --> 36:25.351
Bit of a stretch.

36:25.353 --> 36:27.154
- Was it?
- Yeah.

36:31.459 --> 36:33.058
Is it not good?

36:33.060 --> 36:35.394
- Nope.
- I like it.

36:35.396 --> 36:37.228
Mm. You shouldn't.

36:37.230 --> 36:41.633
Is it...
is it, like, not oaky enough?

36:41.635 --> 36:45.170
Nope, not oaky enough for me.

36:45.172 --> 36:46.338
Yeah.

36:46.340 --> 36:47.739
No oak.

36:47.741 --> 36:49.641
One of those nights, okay.

36:55.583 --> 36:57.649
You are so such a good singer.

36:57.651 --> 36:59.050
I know.

36:59.052 --> 37:01.420
You're such
a good singer, Liz.

37:01.422 --> 37:02.654
I didn't even know.

37:04.825 --> 37:06.658
- Hi!
- What's up?

37:06.660 --> 37:08.960
Hi.

37:08.962 --> 37:10.662
- She made it.
- Obviously.

37:10.664 --> 37:11.997
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:11.999 --> 37:15.000
Oh, I wouldn't miss this.
Come on.

37:15.002 --> 37:16.735
I wouldn't miss you guys. Hi.

37:16.737 --> 37:18.837
Oh, my gosh, get in here.

37:18.839 --> 37:21.640
Look at this furry face.
Look at this.

37:21.642 --> 37:23.675
- Yes.
- I got this for you.

37:23.677 --> 37:25.143
I know.

37:25.145 --> 37:26.177
What? No.

37:26.179 --> 37:28.614
- Yes!
- No, this is amazing.

37:28.616 --> 37:30.749
Who is this?
Who is this?

37:30.751 --> 37:32.384
This is Liz, my cousin.

37:32.386 --> 37:33.819
Hi. I'm Liz.

37:33.821 --> 37:35.521
- Hi.
- What's up?

37:35.523 --> 37:36.822
Namaste.

37:36.824 --> 37:38.189
Man, why the hell
do you have to be

37:38.191 --> 37:40.191
such a fucking tool
all the time?

37:40.193 --> 37:43.329
That was so...

37:43.331 --> 37:45.196
Hey, you brought beer.
You brought beer.

37:45.198 --> 37:46.865
- Yeah.
- Okay, all right.

37:46.867 --> 37:48.035
Stop talking.

37:49.002 --> 37:50.201
Nathan, get over here,

37:50.203 --> 37:52.237
Wake up, honey.
You got to see this.

37:53.240 --> 37:55.240
Mm?
Dad's reserve.

37:55.242 --> 37:57.409
Ooh. Ooh-la-la.

37:59.447 --> 38:00.712
So...

38:00.714 --> 38:02.548
this guy you were seeing?

38:02.550 --> 38:03.715
Oh, yes.

38:03.717 --> 38:05.216
Okay, so, um...

38:05.218 --> 38:07.886
- we went on maybe four dates...
- Mm-hmm.

38:07.888 --> 38:10.188
And he paid for everything,
was super nice and all,

38:10.190 --> 38:12.858
but it was kind of
all that he was,

38:12.860 --> 38:16.428
so I let him know that I didn't
think it was gonna work out,

38:16.430 --> 38:21.032
and he emails me a week later
with scanned receipts

38:21.034 --> 38:23.369
asking that I cover
half of all the meals.

38:23.371 --> 38:24.736
- No.
- Yeah.

38:24.738 --> 38:27.573
I felt embarrassed for him.

38:27.575 --> 38:29.608
- Oh, my...
- It was so bad.

38:29.610 --> 38:32.578
- That is incredible.
- Yeah.

38:32.580 --> 38:33.745
- Fuck.
- Did you...

38:33.747 --> 38:35.447
No.

38:38.486 --> 38:40.251
Nice going, Drillbit Dan.

38:40.253 --> 38:41.221
No.

38:42.089 --> 38:45.291
Let me try, oh, my gosh.

38:45.293 --> 38:47.395
It's, like...

38:50.398 --> 38:51.563
Shit.

38:51.565 --> 38:54.766
That is a $120 bottle
of wine you just ruined.

38:54.768 --> 38:57.469
- I ruined?
- Yes.

38:57.471 --> 38:58.804
- Me?
- Yeah.

38:58.806 --> 39:00.472
At least be a lady
and pay for your half.

39:01.709 --> 39:04.943
Ha ha ha ha.
Deserved that one.

39:04.945 --> 39:06.512
I take PayPal.

39:08.482 --> 39:09.948
Great.

39:09.950 --> 39:13.421
So you like cute guys
to pay for everything?

39:14.788 --> 39:17.623
Well, it doesn't have
to be fancy.

39:17.625 --> 39:18.690
No.

39:18.692 --> 39:19.925
I can be a cheap date

39:19.927 --> 39:21.126
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:21.128 --> 39:23.495
But, yes, he's paying.

39:23.497 --> 39:25.163
Mm.

39:25.165 --> 39:28.434
My ex wanted guys to pay, too,
but...

39:28.436 --> 39:31.002
I don't know.
I thought you'd be more...

39:31.004 --> 39:32.804
"I am woman" about it.

39:32.806 --> 39:35.208
Hmm.
I am woman.

39:36.277 --> 39:37.576
But...

39:37.578 --> 39:41.513
you know, I don't need a guy
to provide for me.

39:41.515 --> 39:45.517
I want a guy who wants
to provide for me.

39:45.519 --> 39:47.553
That's what she said.

39:47.555 --> 39:49.187
What?

39:49.189 --> 39:50.556
My ex.

39:50.558 --> 39:52.291
Oh.

39:52.293 --> 39:55.026
I thought you were making, like,
a "that's what she said" joke.

39:55.028 --> 39:58.163
Oh. Can you imagine?

39:58.165 --> 40:01.867
Yeah, I was, like,
I was nailing this chick, bro,

40:01.869 --> 40:05.737
and she was all, "I want a guy
who wants to provide for me,"

40:05.739 --> 40:08.141
so I provided on her face.

40:11.412 --> 40:12.546
Too far.

40:14.682 --> 40:16.147
Whoops.

40:17.618 --> 40:18.552
It's okay.

40:20.354 --> 40:23.422
So he's like,
"Let's shoot this chase scene,

40:23.424 --> 40:25.491
you know, or, like,
this car sequence."

40:25.493 --> 40:28.126
Yeah, 'cause, of course,
he wrote a high-speed chase

40:28.128 --> 40:29.961
into our high school.

40:29.963 --> 40:30.962
He clips this car.

40:30.964 --> 40:32.898
The driver of that car

40:32.900 --> 40:34.366
calls the school,

40:34.368 --> 40:38.169
and Ankit almost gets
thrown out of the school...

40:38.171 --> 40:39.871
So sad.
Liz, he cared so much.

40:39.873 --> 40:41.072
'Cause I was an overachiever.

40:41.074 --> 40:43.174
Yeah. Yeah, it was bad.

40:43.176 --> 40:45.076
Yeah, you got voted
for most talented,

40:45.078 --> 40:47.879
not for most likely
to succeed, so...

40:47.881 --> 40:50.549
Oh, yeah,
and what were you voted?

40:50.551 --> 40:52.651
You were voted most
likely to be on "SNL."

40:52.653 --> 40:55.220
- Oh, what happened to that?
- That was a lifestyle choice.

40:55.222 --> 40:57.823
I didn't let the yearbook
be my guidance counselor.

40:59.092 --> 41:01.059
Oh, I'm good. I'm good.

41:01.061 --> 41:03.429
I'm totally good.

41:03.431 --> 41:05.230
- Daisy?
- What?

41:05.232 --> 41:07.966
There will be a time
when the bong comes around.

41:07.968 --> 41:09.301
Oh, yeah?

41:09.303 --> 41:11.603
- There will be a time...
- Okay.

41:11.605 --> 41:13.739
When the bong doesn't
come around.

41:13.741 --> 41:15.409
Then what?

41:17.378 --> 41:20.746
Oooh!

41:22.015 --> 41:24.550
All right.

41:24.552 --> 41:26.587
Don't tell my mom, okay?

41:32.926 --> 41:35.294
Nice one.

41:35.296 --> 41:36.828
Fuck.

41:36.830 --> 41:38.263
I made her her first piece.

41:38.265 --> 41:40.366
It was a turquoise elephant,

41:40.368 --> 41:41.933
and you'd smoke
out of the trunk.

41:41.935 --> 41:44.936
Oh, God, what the shit
is this chair?

41:44.938 --> 41:46.938
Fuck you.
I made that pillow.

41:46.940 --> 41:48.774
Hey, be nice.

41:48.776 --> 41:50.241
She just quit her job,

41:50.243 --> 41:52.311
and she needs some tenderness.

41:52.313 --> 41:54.112
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I heard about that.

41:54.114 --> 41:55.847
- I heard about that.
- Thank you.

41:55.849 --> 41:57.115
Daisy.

41:57.117 --> 41:58.584
Let me thread the needle here.

41:58.586 --> 42:02.220
This has been
a really shitty Thanksgiving.

42:02.222 --> 42:04.456
Listen, you, lean back.

42:04.458 --> 42:06.292
- Follow my breath.
- Okay.

42:06.294 --> 42:09.127
I just lost my job
a year ago, too.

42:09.129 --> 42:10.329
Oh, you did?

42:10.331 --> 42:12.298
And now I'm self-employed,

42:12.300 --> 42:14.600
and you can say whatever you
want about my profession.

42:14.602 --> 42:16.134
Oh, my gosh, that's
what I should...

42:16.136 --> 42:17.569
I will say whatever I want.

42:17.571 --> 42:19.270
That's, like, totally
what I need to be doing.

42:19.272 --> 42:20.906
That's good.

42:20.908 --> 42:23.409
I'm self-sufficient, bitch.
I'm self-sufficient.

42:23.411 --> 42:25.444
- Oh, yeah, come on.
- Thank you, cheers.

42:25.446 --> 42:28.680
And it's, like,
the highest level of aspirations

42:28.682 --> 42:30.682
that you can have as a man.

42:30.684 --> 42:32.351
What do you do?

42:32.353 --> 42:34.119
Uber.

42:41.595 --> 42:44.496
- Okay, so strategy games...
- Uh-huh.

42:44.498 --> 42:47.833
I'm gonna... I'm gonna lay it
on the line for you.

42:47.835 --> 42:48.867
- Okay.
- Okay?

42:48.869 --> 42:50.201
Lay it all on the line.

42:50.203 --> 42:51.637
Okay, so you have these
little dudes, right?

42:51.639 --> 42:55.173
- Mm-hmm.
- You're either orcs or robots.

42:55.175 --> 42:57.075
Of course.

42:57.077 --> 43:00.379
And you have to gather
these minerals,

43:00.381 --> 43:04.383
and you use the minerals
to build an army.

43:04.385 --> 43:05.417
Okay.

43:05.419 --> 43:09.187
But in my game,
you're basically...

43:09.189 --> 43:11.559
you just gather the minerals.

43:13.561 --> 43:15.026
Huh.

43:15.028 --> 43:17.396
Like "Mario Kart."

43:17.398 --> 43:18.864
What? No.

43:18.866 --> 43:21.166
That's exactly
what "Mario Kart" is about.

43:21.168 --> 43:24.736
What are you talking about?
I'm trying to educate you here.

43:24.738 --> 43:25.871
Jeez.

43:25.873 --> 43:27.373
Oh.

43:31.812 --> 43:33.479
You're such a boy.

43:33.481 --> 43:37.349
Excuse me, lady, I'm a man.

43:37.351 --> 43:40.752
Uh-huh, Mr. Video Games.

43:40.754 --> 43:42.921
Okay.

43:42.923 --> 43:45.391
You don't respect what I do.

43:45.393 --> 43:47.092
You're being sensitive.

43:47.094 --> 43:49.795
No, I mean, admit it...

43:49.797 --> 43:54.566
you think you're saving mankind
and I'm rotting kids' brains.

43:54.568 --> 43:56.802
I don't have to be
into the things you're into

43:56.804 --> 43:58.770
to like who you are.

43:58.772 --> 44:00.107
I don't know.

44:01.975 --> 44:03.409
I don't know about that.

44:03.411 --> 44:06.478
What?

44:07.981 --> 44:11.750
Well, entertainment
is something I believe in.

44:11.752 --> 44:13.419
It's not just something
I'm into.

44:13.421 --> 44:15.454
It's my mission...

44:15.456 --> 44:18.256
like your mission
to clone Stepford Wives.

44:18.258 --> 44:21.627
Shut up.

44:21.629 --> 44:23.595
Okay, so...

44:23.597 --> 44:26.698
this video game
that you're making

44:26.700 --> 44:29.234
is for the greater glory
of mankind.

44:29.236 --> 44:30.802
Oh, now you shut up.

44:30.804 --> 44:34.039
I just want to know
about your mission.

44:34.041 --> 44:37.409
- I am a man on a mission.
- Ah...

44:37.411 --> 44:40.746
You're good with me,
you're good with my mission.

44:40.748 --> 44:42.113
Okay, good luck.

44:43.684 --> 44:47.286
Hey, there are girls
who are into that.

44:47.288 --> 44:49.821
I had one once,
but, you know, when girls...

44:49.823 --> 44:51.757
Mm-mm. Shh, shh, shh.

44:51.759 --> 44:53.260
Okay.

44:56.129 --> 44:57.228
Hmm.

44:57.230 --> 45:00.131
What's your favorite music?

45:00.133 --> 45:01.569
Black Crows.

45:02.970 --> 45:04.705
I don't like 'em.

45:16.550 --> 45:18.317
All right, kids, kids, come in.

45:18.319 --> 45:19.518
You have to see this.

45:19.520 --> 45:21.152
Come in here right now.

45:23.056 --> 45:24.525
God, our moms.

45:26.527 --> 45:29.697
Well, she's not
driving us home.

45:32.165 --> 45:33.467
Let's...

45:34.635 --> 45:35.603
Yeah.

45:38.138 --> 45:39.505
You two should stay.

45:39.507 --> 45:41.309
We have a guest room.

45:42.643 --> 45:43.675

49:03.777 --> 49:06.077
You've gotten better
since Burning Man.

49:06.079 --> 49:07.178
Oh.

49:07.180 --> 49:08.780
Thanks. It's a new one.

49:08.782 --> 49:11.149
You have to come visit me
at Berkeley.

49:11.151 --> 49:14.353
I could get you, like, some
practice gigs a couple places,

49:14.355 --> 49:15.721
and you can open for me.

49:15.723 --> 49:16.988
It'd be really fun.

49:16.990 --> 49:18.557
Oh, God, I wish.

49:18.559 --> 49:20.392
Let me ask you a question.

49:20.394 --> 49:23.562
What's keeping you in LA?

49:23.564 --> 49:26.398
Yeah, yeah, you quit your job.

49:26.400 --> 49:28.099
You're not seeing anybody.

49:28.101 --> 49:30.702
You haven't bought
into the housing market

49:30.704 --> 49:32.338
or some shit, right?

49:32.340 --> 49:35.607
I mean, maybe it's time
that you... I don't know...

49:35.609 --> 49:37.909
- just move back...
- Explore.

49:37.911 --> 49:40.612
Hung out with your homies
who have your back,

49:40.614 --> 49:44.516
live big, dream big
like you used to.

49:44.518 --> 49:45.884
YOLO.

49:45.886 --> 49:47.486
Yeah.

49:47.488 --> 49:49.054
That'd be nice.

49:49.056 --> 49:52.023
I read that, like,
you're only as successful

49:52.025 --> 49:55.961
as the average of your
six closest friends, right?

49:55.963 --> 49:57.195
But...

49:57.197 --> 49:59.164
when we come together,

49:59.166 --> 50:03.134
we form this elevated
electric-magnetic field.

50:03.136 --> 50:04.470
Bullshit.

50:04.472 --> 50:05.671
No, you can measure it.

50:05.673 --> 50:07.272
How do you measure it?

50:07.274 --> 50:09.508
They have devices.

50:09.510 --> 50:13.745
What, do I have
an electromagnetic field, then?

50:13.747 --> 50:17.316
You definitely have
an electric-magnetic field.

50:17.318 --> 50:20.719
Okay, go back
to your bean bag, please.

50:20.721 --> 50:22.856
I'm sick of bean bags.

50:40.040 --> 50:42.408
I know you're, uh,
preoccupied,

50:42.410 --> 50:44.443
but I'm gonna...

50:44.445 --> 50:46.947
I'm gonna keep
you company, okay?

50:48.782 --> 50:51.051
I shouldn't have drank.

50:52.853 --> 50:55.523
That happens to everybody.

50:56.890 --> 51:00.127
Your problem is
you're too repressed.

51:02.430 --> 51:05.499
Pachamama's got you now.

51:11.071 --> 51:13.672
You remember that Hawaii trip
my senior year?

51:20.348 --> 51:22.481
Wow.

51:22.483 --> 51:27.521
It's like you have a glowing
halo around your head.

51:31.158 --> 51:33.191
You know, I've always
had feelings for you...

51:33.193 --> 51:34.293
Shut up, Chase.

51:34.295 --> 51:35.829
Stop.

51:41.068 --> 51:42.368
- Hey.
- Hi.

51:42.370 --> 51:43.702
You okay?

51:43.704 --> 51:45.170
She's fine.

51:45.172 --> 51:47.038
You ready?

51:47.040 --> 51:48.008
Yeah.

51:49.810 --> 51:52.012
Hey, I really liked your song.

52:19.607 --> 52:20.841
Grandpa?

52:22.843 --> 52:25.477
What are you doing?

52:25.479 --> 52:27.681
What does it look like?

52:32.052 --> 52:36.189
We're gonna get
a real one tomorrow, remember?

52:47.935 --> 52:51.071
Let's just go
to bed, okay, Grandpa?

52:53.907 --> 52:56.310
I want to tell you a story.

53:02.616 --> 53:07.755
There was once a boy who worked
on a ranch for his folks.

53:10.458 --> 53:12.023
Down the road from the ranch,

53:12.025 --> 53:16.129
this neighboring farmer...
he owned a strawberry field.

53:19.032 --> 53:23.270
And that farmer...
he had a beautiful daughter.

53:25.973 --> 53:29.176
And the boy fell in love
with her the instant he saw her.

53:31.712 --> 53:34.045
He hadn't known her
for two weeks,

53:34.047 --> 53:37.318
and that ranch boy...
he knew this was it.

53:40.754 --> 53:43.223
And when the farmer said no...

53:46.827 --> 53:49.828
He stole her away on his horse,

53:49.830 --> 53:52.698
and they rode
over the strawberry fields,

53:52.700 --> 53:55.000
and they started...

53:55.002 --> 53:58.306
a whole new life together
that very night.

54:03.677 --> 54:05.145
But then when...

54:07.415 --> 54:09.317
When things went south...

54:11.319 --> 54:13.385
Money.

54:13.387 --> 54:15.255
You know, things that...

54:17.325 --> 54:20.328
Things that get
in the way of life.

54:23.497 --> 54:27.533
They started talking less
and less to each other,

54:27.535 --> 54:30.237
even when things were good.

54:33.341 --> 54:35.574
And they
stopped talking altogether

54:35.576 --> 54:38.209
when things were bad.

54:38.211 --> 54:40.712
There were times
they even forgot

54:40.714 --> 54:43.183
why they were even together.

55:03.737 --> 55:06.106
It's okay.

55:07.608 --> 55:09.209
It's okay.

58:02.149 --> 58:04.983
Yo, dude. Uh, I don't know
if you got my email,

58:04.985 --> 58:06.585
but my Uncle Kevin backed out.

58:06.587 --> 58:09.355
Apparently he got sued
by his Taiwanese ex-wife

58:09.357 --> 58:11.122
and lost all of his money,

58:11.124 --> 58:13.158
so he can't invest
in the app anymore.

58:13.160 --> 58:16.161
So, you know, your parents
are gonna have to do it.

58:16.163 --> 58:18.163
Listen, dude, I don't care
what you have to do,

58:18.165 --> 58:19.998
whether it's go back
to Hebrew school,

58:20.000 --> 58:21.633
start rocking a yarmulke,
go kosher,

58:21.635 --> 58:23.268
just get
in your parents' good graces

58:23.270 --> 58:25.304
because we're gonna
need our funding, bro.

58:25.306 --> 58:27.272
Anyway, I hope Thanksgiving
was fantastic.

58:27.274 --> 58:30.077
Mine wasn't
'cause I was with my family.

58:36.917 --> 58:39.951
You look like Michael Cera.

58:39.953 --> 58:42.654
Thanks.
You're up early.

58:42.656 --> 58:44.122
Oh, sorry.

58:44.124 --> 58:46.958
I was trying to be
as quiet as possible.

58:46.960 --> 58:48.394
You want a shake?

58:48.396 --> 58:51.029
No, I'm still stuffed.

58:51.031 --> 58:52.263
I'm gonna go for a jog.

58:52.265 --> 58:55.166
Oh, oh, you can join us.

58:55.168 --> 58:56.970
- Hi, babies.
- Hi.

58:58.472 --> 59:01.940
- Mom, are you going for a jog?
- I was thinking about it.

59:01.942 --> 59:03.709
What the crap
is going on here?

59:03.711 --> 59:07.245
My mom hasn't joined
me on run... ever.

59:07.247 --> 59:08.680
You know what?
You're right.

59:08.682 --> 59:11.850
I would just slow you down.
You two should go.

59:11.852 --> 59:13.452
Oh, no, you were so close.

59:13.454 --> 59:15.354
Hey, I got my walk
to the front porch,

59:15.356 --> 59:16.688
and that's a good start for me.

59:17.991 --> 59:19.425
I haven't exercised
in ten years.

59:19.427 --> 59:21.226
This morning's not gonna make
any difference.

59:21.228 --> 59:24.062
No, Mom, come with us.
You got to come.

59:24.064 --> 59:26.865
Oh, and who's gonna do your
laundry for you before you go?

59:26.867 --> 59:28.334
You?

59:28.336 --> 59:30.137
Good luck keeping up with her.

59:32.640 --> 59:34.308
Come on.

59:40.714 --> 59:42.483
- You okay?
- Yeah.

59:57.398 --> 59:59.166
Hmm...

01:01:02.763 --> 01:01:03.929
Leona LaRue.

01:01:03.931 --> 01:01:07.265
Ah, the one that got away.

01:01:07.267 --> 01:01:09.968
Honestly, she should've been.

01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:11.937
First girlfriend.

01:01:11.939 --> 01:01:15.574
First date, I hacked
a loogie in her face.

01:01:15.576 --> 01:01:16.942
Wow.

01:01:16.944 --> 01:01:18.243
I spit away from her,

01:01:18.245 --> 01:01:19.611
and the wind threw
it back in her face.

01:01:19.613 --> 01:01:21.380
Oh, ew.

01:01:21.382 --> 01:01:23.349
And then we dated
for three years.

01:01:23.351 --> 01:01:25.784
Leona LaRue lacked options.

01:01:25.786 --> 01:01:28.255
Yeah, poor Leona.

01:01:30.958 --> 01:01:32.924
Hmm.

01:01:32.926 --> 01:01:36.395
I'm just thinking about
all the married girls I know.

01:01:36.397 --> 01:01:39.965
I wonder if they lacked
options, you know?

01:01:39.967 --> 01:01:41.300
Are they with the one,

01:01:41.302 --> 01:01:45.637
or has the one
just not shown up yet?

01:01:45.639 --> 01:01:48.609
Okay, all right, I got to
say some things here...

01:01:50.844 --> 01:01:52.613
To you.

01:01:55.983 --> 01:01:57.851
Mm...

01:02:10.531 --> 01:02:13.164
♪ Inside my dreams

01:02:13.166 --> 01:02:15.601
♪ Can you find me, love?

01:02:15.603 --> 01:02:20.474
♪ I'm waiting here for you ♪

01:02:24.211 --> 01:02:27.313
Hey, you two,
how was the run?

01:02:27.315 --> 01:02:28.680
Good.

01:02:28.682 --> 01:02:30.582
Oh, looks like you guys
worked up an appetite.

01:02:30.584 --> 01:02:32.083
I'm gonna wash up.

01:02:32.085 --> 01:02:34.986
Okay, well, hurry down
so that we can all eat together.

01:02:34.988 --> 01:02:37.088
Um, I had a shake this morning,
so I'm good,

01:02:37.090 --> 01:02:38.424
but can I borrow the car?

01:02:38.426 --> 01:02:40.191
- I'm gonna just go out.
- Why?

01:02:40.193 --> 01:02:42.694
Because I forgot some things,

01:02:42.696 --> 01:02:44.162
you know, things a girl needs.

01:02:44.164 --> 01:02:46.197
Well, Eleanor has some things.

01:02:46.199 --> 01:02:48.534
I get...
I get allergic reactions,

01:02:48.536 --> 01:02:50.035
so I have to be
super particular about...

01:02:50.037 --> 01:02:51.036
Well, Michael can take you.

01:02:51.038 --> 01:02:52.671
Okay, no, he can't,

01:02:52.673 --> 01:02:54.840
because it's Thanksgiving,
and the stores are closed.

01:02:54.842 --> 01:02:56.742
- It's Black Friday.
- Mom, the stores are closed.

01:02:56.744 --> 01:02:58.977
Can I just have the car?

01:02:58.979 --> 01:03:00.646
Samira.

01:03:00.648 --> 01:03:03.917
It's okay. Let the kids do
what they're gonna do.

01:03:24.838 --> 01:03:25.873
Dude.

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:28.206
Dude.

01:03:28.208 --> 01:03:29.741
- Daisy, Daisy.
- Oh.

01:03:29.743 --> 01:03:31.910
Ugh, I'm sorry.

01:03:31.912 --> 01:03:34.214
Sorry, I-I forgot.

01:03:38.085 --> 01:03:40.552
When do you leave with Mike?

01:03:40.554 --> 01:03:42.921
We texted last night, actually.

01:03:42.923 --> 01:03:44.423
And?

01:03:44.425 --> 01:03:48.760
And we said
we loved each other.

01:03:48.762 --> 01:03:52.263
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

01:03:52.265 --> 01:03:55.200
So what are you gonna do?

01:03:55.202 --> 01:03:57.636
Um...

01:03:57.638 --> 01:03:59.540
I-I don't know yet.

01:04:01.274 --> 01:04:02.510
Wow.

01:04:04.778 --> 01:04:10.418
So I may have sent him the video
of you singing last night.

01:04:12.286 --> 01:04:14.653
- Shit.
- What?

01:04:14.655 --> 01:04:15.987
Oh, why would you do that?

01:04:15.989 --> 01:04:17.122
Liz, fuck.

01:04:17.124 --> 01:04:19.658
I was just trying to help.

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:20.792
Michael.

01:04:20.794 --> 01:04:22.127
I don't even know what to think,

01:04:22.129 --> 01:04:23.362
- I am so embarrassed.
- Whoa.

01:04:23.364 --> 01:04:24.596
Ele, what the hell is going on?

01:04:24.598 --> 01:04:26.231
Oh, come look.
Look what your son did.

01:04:26.233 --> 01:04:28.099
What?

01:04:28.101 --> 01:04:30.402
- How did you get that?
- I forwarded it to myself.

01:04:30.404 --> 01:04:31.870
Oh, that makes more sense.

01:04:31.872 --> 01:04:33.672
I thought your girlfriend
was texting your mom.

01:04:33.674 --> 01:04:34.940
Mom, what the flying fuck?

01:04:34.942 --> 01:04:36.675
Don't you dare make this
about me.

01:04:36.677 --> 01:04:38.944
Did Samira see this?
Is that why she's so upset?

01:04:38.946 --> 01:04:41.012
She's upset because you
flew her across the country

01:04:41.014 --> 01:04:42.981
to set her up with a taken guy.

01:04:42.983 --> 01:04:44.182
What?

01:04:44.184 --> 01:04:45.953
I'm getting back with Daisy.

01:04:47.355 --> 01:04:49.821
W-we still love each other.

01:04:49.823 --> 01:04:52.658
Daisy, the song's beautiful.
Was he not supposed to hear it?

01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:54.192
Well, what if that's
not where I'm at, Liz?

01:04:54.194 --> 01:04:57.128
What if I'm not where he
needs me to be at right now?

01:04:57.130 --> 01:04:58.764
This is so backwards.

01:04:58.766 --> 01:05:00.499
I mean, you were just texting
that you love him.

01:05:00.501 --> 01:05:01.633
- Do you love him?
- Yes.

01:05:01.635 --> 01:05:04.035
You for fucking real love him?

01:05:04.037 --> 01:05:05.804
Yes.

01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:08.173
Aren't guys supposed to have

01:05:08.175 --> 01:05:09.708
the commitment issues?

01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:11.343
This isn't commitment issues.

01:05:11.345 --> 01:05:13.679
I'm trying to deal with my
new fucking lease right now.

01:05:13.681 --> 01:05:15.180
I don't know where my
next job is gonna be.

01:05:15.182 --> 01:05:16.515
I could be homeless in a month.

01:05:16.517 --> 01:05:18.684
Daisy.

01:05:18.686 --> 01:05:21.520
That's commitment issues.

01:05:21.522 --> 01:05:25.891
Sometimes I wish I just met him
in five years.

01:05:25.893 --> 01:05:28.159
You would be a fucking idiot
to let this guy go.

01:05:28.161 --> 01:05:30.028
I mean, do you have
any idea how lucky you are

01:05:30.030 --> 01:05:33.131
to find a guy who's willing
to put up with this shit?

01:05:33.133 --> 01:05:34.666
Don't talk to me like that.

01:05:34.668 --> 01:05:37.703
I'm sorry,
but you drive me crazy.

01:05:37.705 --> 01:05:40.138
I can't even imagine
how he must feel.

01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:41.473
I want to know when.

01:05:41.475 --> 01:05:43.174
When were you gonna tell us
about this woman

01:05:43.176 --> 01:05:45.143
you've been sneaking in and out
of your attic?

01:05:45.145 --> 01:05:46.378
What?

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:47.846
This is why
it always falls apart.

01:05:47.848 --> 01:05:50.582
She is terrified
of pleasing you guys.

01:05:50.584 --> 01:05:52.318
You know, she had a dream
that we were Filipino,

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:55.220
and Mom was forcing her to spit
into a communal pot

01:05:55.222 --> 01:05:56.388
and she couldn't do it?

01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:59.825
Filipino?
Do I look Filipino?

01:06:00.994 --> 01:06:02.394
Oh, Nathan, don't
even start with me.

01:06:02.396 --> 01:06:03.895
You listen to me, Michael.

01:06:03.897 --> 01:06:06.432
You and this meshuganah girl...
it's like an addiction.

01:06:06.434 --> 01:06:08.233
This is not love.
It's like you're addicted...

01:06:08.235 --> 01:06:09.668
You do not know
what you're talking about.

01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:11.403
I do know that much!
Listen to me!

01:06:11.405 --> 01:06:13.705
All right, all right.

01:06:13.707 --> 01:06:15.876
Go ahead, handle it.

01:06:17.411 --> 01:06:18.844
Listen, no matter
how many notches

01:06:18.846 --> 01:06:20.211
you think you got on your belt,

01:06:20.213 --> 01:06:22.814
you're still young
and impressionable,

01:06:22.816 --> 01:06:25.150
and not that they want to,
but women will wreck you.

01:06:25.152 --> 01:06:26.552
Ha!

01:06:26.554 --> 01:06:29.254
Not all of 'em, but they
make you do crazy shit,

01:06:29.256 --> 01:06:32.123
and everybody's got to
go through it once.

01:06:32.125 --> 01:06:34.626
But your mom and I think
you're crawling out of a pit

01:06:34.628 --> 01:06:36.628
just to jump right back in,

01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:38.597
four times, five times.

01:06:38.599 --> 01:06:40.165
I mean, you got to see after...

01:06:40.167 --> 01:06:42.901
Look, I'm sorry.
People don't change.

01:06:42.903 --> 01:06:44.736
I don't want her
to change, Dad.

01:06:44.738 --> 01:06:48.106
Yes, you do,
not in a bad way, but you do.

01:06:48.108 --> 01:06:50.442
Haven't you always said
how unhappy she is,

01:06:50.444 --> 01:06:52.844
her place in life?

01:06:52.846 --> 01:06:56.047
She's happier with me.
I'm happier with her.

01:06:56.049 --> 01:06:58.617
Oh, Michael, you think things
are gonna go great in life

01:06:58.619 --> 01:07:00.051
because you're both happy.

01:07:00.053 --> 01:07:03.054
I can't help
who I fall in love with, Mom.

01:07:03.056 --> 01:07:05.190
Listen to me.

01:07:05.192 --> 01:07:07.759
If I told you that this girl
wasn't gonna figure out

01:07:07.761 --> 01:07:10.228
what she wants out of life
for another 10 years,

01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:13.064
would you still love her
and want to be with her?

01:07:13.066 --> 01:07:14.566
Yes.

01:07:14.568 --> 01:07:17.268
You know, it's not your life.

01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:19.805
And I didn't ask you
for your fucking advice.

01:07:19.807 --> 01:07:23.041
Daisy, you always ask
for my advice.

01:07:23.043 --> 01:07:25.277
Do you want to be with him,
or are you too scared to admit

01:07:25.279 --> 01:07:27.012
that you don't
want to be with him?

01:07:27.014 --> 01:07:28.213
Fuck off.

01:07:28.215 --> 01:07:29.448
Excuse you?

01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:31.550
Fuck off to Stockholm.

01:07:31.552 --> 01:07:32.818
You want my job, Daisy?

01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:35.020
Do you want my boyfriend, Liz?

01:07:35.022 --> 01:07:35.989
Wow.

01:07:37.558 --> 01:07:40.027
You use that term loosely.

01:07:44.498 --> 01:07:45.633
Eleanor...

01:07:57.911 --> 01:07:58.979
There...

01:08:00.681 --> 01:08:02.514
I give up.

01:08:02.516 --> 01:08:05.484
Nathan, don't touch that ring.

01:08:05.486 --> 01:08:07.218
You want to make
your own decisions,

01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:10.155
turn against your family,
go ahead.

01:08:10.157 --> 01:08:13.158
He's a grown man, right?

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:16.495
He can make
his own decisions, right?

01:08:16.497 --> 01:08:19.163
Fine, then, you go ahead,

01:08:19.166 --> 01:08:22.600
and you give my mother's ring
to whomever you like.

01:08:22.603 --> 01:08:24.069
You just let us know,

01:08:24.071 --> 01:08:25.871
so maybe we can come
to the wedding

01:08:25.872 --> 01:08:27.508
and sit in the back!

01:08:35.283 --> 01:08:37.948
What the fuck just happened?

01:08:37.951 --> 01:08:39.917
I don't need this shit.

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.756
- Oh, come on.
- No, I'm out of here.

01:08:45.826 --> 01:08:48.095
Happy Thanksgiving, Mom.

01:08:54.734 --> 01:08:57.102
Mazel tov.

01:09:27.935 --> 01:09:29.002
Okay.

01:09:31.004 --> 01:09:34.973
Thank Thee Heavenly Father for
what we are about to receive.

01:09:34.975 --> 01:09:37.876
And pray Thee
for Thy continued blessings.

01:09:37.877 --> 01:09:40.011
Thank You for this food,

01:09:40.013 --> 01:09:42.413
and thank You for this family.

01:09:42.416 --> 01:09:43.415
Amen.

01:09:43.417 --> 01:09:45.118
Amen.

01:12:40.494 --> 01:12:43.128
Is this...?

01:13:38.419 --> 01:13:41.019
So you...

01:13:41.021 --> 01:13:43.021
want to come over?

01:13:48.962 --> 01:13:51.630
- I missed you.
- Me too.

01:13:51.632 --> 01:13:54.199
I want to know everything.

01:13:54.201 --> 01:13:56.835
What's been going on with you?

01:13:56.837 --> 01:13:58.970
Well...

01:13:58.972 --> 01:14:02.308
my car's radiator blew out,

01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:05.311
and I had to hitchhike home
practically with this guy.

01:14:05.313 --> 01:14:06.478
Oh, no.

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.513
Yeah.

01:14:07.515 --> 01:14:10.015
What was he like?

01:14:10.017 --> 01:14:13.251
He has a cute butt.

01:14:13.253 --> 01:14:15.621
Yeah.

01:14:15.623 --> 01:14:17.823
You should've heard my parents
going on and on about you

01:14:17.825 --> 01:14:19.791
and everything you're doing.

01:14:19.793 --> 01:14:22.394
It's really inspiring me
to think more aggressively

01:14:22.396 --> 01:14:23.864
about my career.

01:14:25.165 --> 01:14:27.333
That's good, babe.

01:14:27.335 --> 01:14:29.437
We're gonna get you there.

01:14:35.409 --> 01:14:38.479
I want to talk to you
about something.

01:14:40.013 --> 01:14:41.214
Okay.

01:14:42.783 --> 01:14:45.453
I've decided to look
for another contract.

01:14:48.088 --> 01:14:49.254
- Abroad?
- I know, I know.

01:14:49.256 --> 01:14:52.190
Just hear me out. I...

01:14:52.192 --> 01:14:54.560
I've been thinking
about it a lot,

01:14:54.562 --> 01:14:58.497
and it's really
in my heart to travel more.

01:14:58.499 --> 01:14:59.433
Okay.

01:15:02.235 --> 01:15:05.236
And there's this opportunity

01:15:05.238 --> 01:15:08.274
that could turn
into a real full-time job.

01:15:08.276 --> 01:15:12.143
- What could?
- This NGO in China.

01:15:12.145 --> 01:15:14.313
I'd be working
with kids every day,

01:15:14.315 --> 01:15:15.814
teaching orphan girls.

01:15:15.816 --> 01:15:18.950
- It just sounds...
- Wow. China, that's, like...

01:15:18.952 --> 01:15:20.652
I know.

01:15:20.654 --> 01:15:22.388
Wheew.

01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:24.356
I know. Baby, I just
wanted to bring it up,

01:15:24.358 --> 01:15:27.926
so we could talk about it,
like, as soon as I knew.

01:15:27.928 --> 01:15:30.128
- Yeah.
- Okay, so first of all,

01:15:30.130 --> 01:15:31.863
it wouldn't even start
until April,

01:15:31.865 --> 01:15:33.832
and it's not like we haven't
done long distance before,

01:15:33.834 --> 01:15:35.501
and you could come
visit this time

01:15:35.503 --> 01:15:38.269
because you're trying to get
out of your day job anyway.

01:15:38.271 --> 01:15:40.238
China is really connected.

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:42.274
You could do your work
from there,

01:15:42.276 --> 01:15:45.243
and I'd be in a job that
actually matters, you know.

01:15:45.245 --> 01:15:48.514
Like, I'd really be making
a difference.

01:15:48.516 --> 01:15:49.515
Yeah.

01:15:49.517 --> 01:15:52.351
I hear you totally.
Yeah, okay.

01:15:52.353 --> 01:15:55.854
Um...

01:15:55.856 --> 01:15:57.458
Wow.

01:15:58.692 --> 01:16:00.826
So you... you've...

01:16:00.828 --> 01:16:04.131
You want to go.
You've decided.

01:16:05.799 --> 01:16:07.468
Okay, and you want...

01:16:08.736 --> 01:16:09.970
Me to go?

01:16:11.839 --> 01:16:13.539
Not necessarily.

01:16:13.541 --> 01:16:17.008
We could work
on us either way, but...

01:16:17.010 --> 01:16:19.010
I mean...

01:16:19.012 --> 01:16:20.648
would you?

01:16:22.483 --> 01:16:24.151
Maybe. Um...

01:16:25.319 --> 01:16:29.020
I mean,
I would need to look into...

01:16:29.022 --> 01:16:30.991
Well, like...

01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:34.526
Yeah, I-I don't know.
I don't know.

01:16:34.528 --> 01:16:35.861
Okay.

01:16:35.863 --> 01:16:37.829
There's not, like, a job
you could find that you like

01:16:37.831 --> 01:16:40.432
that's not in North Korea
or whatever, you know,

01:16:40.434 --> 01:16:43.036
'cause, like, I'm here.

01:16:44.838 --> 01:16:47.839
Okay, it's not like I want
to choose this over you.

01:16:47.841 --> 01:16:49.741
That's not what I want.

01:16:49.743 --> 01:16:51.512
It feels like you do.

01:16:53.213 --> 01:16:56.016
Isn't that kind of
what you're doing?

01:16:57.217 --> 01:16:58.384
What do you...

01:16:58.386 --> 01:17:00.051
I have a career here.

01:17:00.053 --> 01:17:02.020
Like, I have people
that depend on me.

01:17:02.022 --> 01:17:03.489
Yeah, and that's
what I want, too.

01:17:03.491 --> 01:17:04.756
- That's what I'm trying to find.
- Right.

01:17:04.758 --> 01:17:06.492
I think that that's
there for me.

01:17:06.494 --> 01:17:08.762
Right, okay, but how long
would you be gone for?

01:17:10.731 --> 01:17:15.434
You see, it's like you
can't just ask me to...

01:17:15.436 --> 01:17:16.568
Okay.

01:17:16.570 --> 01:17:18.203
Come on, don't, don't, don't...

01:17:18.205 --> 01:17:19.705
What? Don't what?

01:17:19.707 --> 01:17:22.874
Okay, well, why...
Can't we just talk about...

01:17:22.876 --> 01:17:26.244
It could be forever, you know?
Like, I...

01:17:26.246 --> 01:17:28.046
You can't just put that on me.

01:17:28.048 --> 01:17:30.682
Like, all I've ever tried
to do is make this work,

01:17:30.684 --> 01:17:33.084
and I thought you wanted to give
this a real shot, you know.

01:17:33.086 --> 01:17:36.422
I thought
that you sent the...

01:17:36.424 --> 01:17:38.290
I don't...
I'm sorry, I don't know.

01:17:38.292 --> 01:17:40.559
I wish you and I could've had
a conversation

01:17:40.561 --> 01:17:43.397
before Liz sent
you all that shit.

01:17:46.166 --> 01:17:47.468
Why is that?

01:17:49.002 --> 01:17:50.769
Well, because we're the ones
in this, Michael,

01:17:50.771 --> 01:17:52.938
and I deserve the chance
to talk with you

01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:55.441
about how I feel.

01:17:55.443 --> 01:17:58.646
Yeah, well, I guess
she's just trying to help.

01:18:04.785 --> 01:18:06.253
What?

01:18:08.422 --> 01:18:12.123
How often exactly
does she talk with you?

01:18:12.125 --> 01:18:15.093
I don't know. She's my friend.

01:18:15.095 --> 01:18:18.764
We were broken up, and she
was, like, really there for me.

01:18:18.766 --> 01:18:19.931
She'd call you?

01:18:19.933 --> 01:18:21.433
No, she was in town a few times,

01:18:21.435 --> 01:18:22.934
so she came over
to check in on...

01:18:22.936 --> 01:18:26.440
Wait, you called my cousin
to your place?

01:18:28.509 --> 01:18:30.942
Um...

01:18:30.944 --> 01:18:33.845
That's weird, Michael.

01:18:33.847 --> 01:18:35.847
We drank Nesquik.

01:18:35.849 --> 01:18:37.683
We talked about you.

01:18:37.685 --> 01:18:40.185
Oh, okay, so, like,
it wouldn't be weird

01:18:40.187 --> 01:18:43.322
if I went to hang out at Zach's
place, just the two of us.

01:18:43.324 --> 01:18:46.625
Not if you were drinking
Nesquik.

01:18:46.627 --> 01:18:48.159
Wow.

01:18:48.161 --> 01:18:50.596
I just can't believe
this right now.

01:18:50.598 --> 01:18:53.865
Are you...
Nothing fucking happened!

01:18:53.867 --> 01:18:56.602
Do you know how much
nothing fucking happened?

01:18:56.604 --> 01:18:58.470
I didn't even think it was
weird to invite her over.

01:18:58.472 --> 01:19:01.006
It didn't even cross my mind.

01:19:01.008 --> 01:19:02.007
What? I can...

01:19:02.009 --> 01:19:03.074
Okay, I can't believe

01:19:03.076 --> 01:19:04.476
I'm defending myself right now.

01:19:04.478 --> 01:19:06.345
You do realize that while
you were in Cambodia,

01:19:06.347 --> 01:19:10.318
I didn't do a single fucking
thing with another girl, right?

01:19:13.454 --> 01:19:14.720
You didn't?

01:19:14.722 --> 01:19:15.656
No.

01:19:21.562 --> 01:19:23.564
I didn't know that.

01:19:27.835 --> 01:19:29.670
Did you...?

01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:35.309
Did you...?

01:20:06.173 --> 01:20:08.509
You slept with someone.

01:20:10.578 --> 01:20:14.780
A friend... a friend of a friend
in Phnom Penh,

01:20:14.782 --> 01:20:16.014
we...

01:20:16.016 --> 01:20:20.218
we partied and got drunk,
and it was, um...

01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:22.087
it was just physical, that's it.

01:20:22.089 --> 01:20:24.990
So... so you would call me,

01:20:24.992 --> 01:20:26.892
crying about your shitty day
teaching these brats,

01:20:26.894 --> 01:20:28.927
and then on good days,
you were with him.

01:20:28.929 --> 01:20:30.496
What the fuck?

01:20:30.498 --> 01:20:32.564
You seriously have the gall
to rip me a new asshole

01:20:32.566 --> 01:20:34.199
for getting hot cocoa
with your cousin.

01:20:34.201 --> 01:20:36.602
That's not fair, okay?
We weren't together then!

01:20:36.604 --> 01:20:37.903
And you're the one who told me

01:20:37.905 --> 01:20:39.771
that you intend to date
while I was gone.

01:20:39.773 --> 01:20:42.841
You, like, spelled it out
for me.

01:20:42.843 --> 01:20:45.977
I thought that guy
was gonna be, you know,

01:20:45.979 --> 01:20:50.551
my last huzzah, like, ever.

01:20:53.053 --> 01:20:57.591
And I did... I did come home
to be with you.

01:21:00.294 --> 01:21:01.729
I couldn't...

01:21:03.464 --> 01:21:06.898
I couldn't even go
through with it.

01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:08.334
He took me up,
and we undressed...

01:21:08.336 --> 01:21:10.003
Stop.

01:21:13.307 --> 01:21:15.140
Michael.

01:22:35.389 --> 01:22:38.492
I know how much I've hurt you.

01:22:41.194 --> 01:22:43.864
And I feel so...

01:22:48.936 --> 01:22:51.236
I don't even know
how to forgive myself anymore...

01:22:51.238 --> 01:22:53.541
- Shit.
- Because...

01:22:55.042 --> 01:22:56.944
I look at you and...

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:02.550
How amazing you are and...

01:23:06.019 --> 01:23:08.219
And this feeling...

01:23:08.221 --> 01:23:12.591
this feeling that won't shut up
keeps coming back,

01:23:12.593 --> 01:23:15.260
and... and I don't understand it.

01:23:15.262 --> 01:23:17.164
And I know...

01:23:19.199 --> 01:23:20.766
How much you hate me for it.

01:23:20.768 --> 01:23:22.100
I don't hate you.

01:23:22.102 --> 01:23:23.302
I hate myself more

01:23:23.304 --> 01:23:25.973
because I don't want
to hurt you anymore.

01:23:29.410 --> 01:23:31.443
And I want you to have
what you want.

01:23:31.445 --> 01:23:32.744
Daisy...

01:23:32.746 --> 01:23:34.112
I don't know what's wrong
with me.

01:23:34.114 --> 01:23:35.581
You're, like...

01:23:35.583 --> 01:23:37.985
You're my perfect guy.

01:23:43.256 --> 01:23:45.092
You're, like, my list.

01:23:47.928 --> 01:23:50.163
I don't have a list anymore.

01:23:53.166 --> 01:23:55.002
All I want is you.

01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:02.109
I don't care
how unfinished we are...

01:24:04.077 --> 01:24:08.115
And how crazy we are
and how stupid we are.

01:24:11.519 --> 01:24:14.019
I love you like
an obsessed crazy person.

01:24:19.126 --> 01:24:21.293
I want to support you...

01:24:21.295 --> 01:24:24.465
however it is
you want to be supported.

01:24:26.934 --> 01:24:29.803
And I don't care
what we've gone through.

01:24:31.238 --> 01:24:32.706
I accept it all.

01:24:38.912 --> 01:24:41.347
Everything I need to be happy
for the rest of my life

01:24:41.349 --> 01:24:42.650
is right here.

01:24:56.063 --> 01:24:56.895
Oh, my God.

01:24:56.897 --> 01:24:58.666
From the bottom of my heart...

01:25:02.370 --> 01:25:03.704
Will you marry me?

01:25:18.593 --> 01:25:23.254
