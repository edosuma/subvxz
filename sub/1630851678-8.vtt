WEBVTT

00:53.836 --> 00:56.056
And now the Internet.

00:57.405 --> 00:59.537
The answers to the mysteries
of the universe,

00:59.581 --> 01:01.322
right at your fingertips.

01:01.365 --> 01:04.325
It's an endless well
of knowledge.

01:04.368 --> 01:06.588
More like an endless well
of cat videos.

01:11.201 --> 01:12.550
Aw.

01:12.594 --> 01:13.986
Do you think
he's self-taught?

01:14.030 --> 01:17.555
♪ <i>Meow, meow, meow, meow</i>♪

01:17.599 --> 01:19.122
Ooh!

01:19.166 --> 01:20.167
Huh?

01:20.210 --> 01:22.256
Guys, guys, guys!
I did it!

01:22.299 --> 01:25.172
I fixed Frobo!

01:25.215 --> 01:26.173
Come on!
Check it out!

01:26.216 --> 01:28.175
Fixed him?
Uh...

01:28.218 --> 01:29.524
Okay, show us Frob--

01:29.567 --> 01:30.655
What the hay?
Uh...

01:35.225 --> 01:37.227
So, what do you think?

01:37.271 --> 01:38.620
Pretty impressive, right?

01:38.663 --> 01:40.230
Ow!

01:40.274 --> 01:41.362
Impressive's one way
to put it.

01:41.405 --> 01:43.190
You guys ready for this?

01:43.233 --> 01:45.366
Polly, I don't think
you should turn him on yet.

01:45.409 --> 01:47.585
Yeah. Are you sure
you even know
what you're doing?

01:47.629 --> 01:50.501
Of course I know
what I'm doing, Anne.

01:50.545 --> 01:53.200
Everything's gonna be just fine.

01:54.549 --> 01:56.986
Something's supposed
to happen, right?

01:57.029 --> 02:00.120
Finally, my new one-of-a-kind
limited edition controller
just came in.

02:01.251 --> 02:02.252
Aw.

02:04.036 --> 02:05.777
Meow!

02:12.436 --> 02:16.223
Polly, what were you thinking?
You could've just killed us.

02:16.266 --> 02:20.009
Sorry, sorry.
I know he's got some kinks
to work out but--

02:20.052 --> 02:22.011
Nuh-uh. Enough of this.

02:22.054 --> 02:25.188
I forbid you from working
on this robot further.

02:25.232 --> 02:26.798
I'm with Hop Pop,
Polly.

02:26.842 --> 02:28.583
I think we should wait till
we get back to Amphibia.

02:28.626 --> 02:30.759
Then maybe we can find someone
who knows robots, you know?

02:30.802 --> 02:32.891
I know you miss him.
We do too.

02:32.935 --> 02:35.067
But you just need
to be patient.

02:35.111 --> 02:37.635
Hey, how about
a new robot friend
to play with?

02:37.679 --> 02:40.986
This is Teddy Lumpkins.
He used to be my best friend.

02:41.030 --> 02:43.641
<i>I eat eyes...</i>

02:43.685 --> 02:45.034
What the--

02:45.077 --> 02:46.340
<i>...cream.
I eat ice cream.</i>

02:46.383 --> 02:47.384
Oh.
Well,
that's fine.

02:47.428 --> 02:48.994
Loggle would like
this thing.

02:49.038 --> 02:51.693
How dare you?
Frobo can't be replaced!

02:52.955 --> 02:55.349
<i>I want to nibble
your fingers.</i>

02:58.047 --> 02:59.570
Okay, creepy bears aside,

02:59.614 --> 03:01.616
don't work on Frobo.

03:01.659 --> 03:04.793
Maybe you guys
are right.

03:04.836 --> 03:07.143
Wow, that's surprisingly
mature of you.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.363
Mm-hmm.
Hey, can I borrow
your laptop?

03:09.406 --> 03:10.451
I don't see why not.

03:15.456 --> 03:17.588
"Eh, I forbid you.
It's too dangerous."

03:18.981 --> 03:20.287
The look on their faces

03:20.330 --> 03:22.071
was pretty funny, though,
huh, Frobes?

03:24.421 --> 03:26.249
Oh, right.
You're still broken.

03:27.555 --> 03:29.513
But don't worry.
We can fix you.

03:29.557 --> 03:31.428
I just need
to educate myself.

03:31.472 --> 03:34.301
Anne did say you can
learn anything you want
on the Internet.

03:34.344 --> 03:36.738
I guess we should
give it a try.

03:36.781 --> 03:40.307
Fasten your seat belt,
Frobes. We're going in.

03:53.581 --> 03:56.279
Well, that was
two hours of my life
I'll never get back.

03:56.323 --> 03:57.889
Oh, hey, what's this?

03:59.587 --> 04:03.460
"IT Gals.
Just two girlfriends
who really love robots."

04:03.504 --> 04:04.940
Cool!

04:06.158 --> 04:07.725
<i>Isn't he adorable?</i>

04:07.769 --> 04:10.554
<i>I just can't
with that belly.</i>

04:10.598 --> 04:13.992
<i>Just goes to show,
anyone can make
and maintain a robot</i>

04:14.036 --> 04:16.343
<i>if you have the will,
the know-how...</i>

04:16.386 --> 04:18.562
<i>...and our step-by-step
tutorials.</i>

04:18.606 --> 04:22.566
<i>And remember,
if it doesn't compute,
it's time to reboot.</i>

04:24.133 --> 04:25.743
Welp, that's all
I needed to hear.

04:25.787 --> 04:28.572
<i>Welcome to the IT Girls
Self-Help Playlist.</i>

04:28.616 --> 04:30.357
<i>First up, gearing up.</i>

04:30.400 --> 04:32.228
<i>The keywords are safety...</i>

04:32.272 --> 04:34.491
<i>...and style.</i>

04:34.535 --> 04:37.233
<i>If you find that
you're having problems
with the sockets...</i>

04:37.277 --> 04:39.757
<i>...try finding
any problematic lug nuts
and tightening them up.</i>

04:41.759 --> 04:43.892
<i>Connect the red
and blue wires.</i>

04:43.935 --> 04:47.199
<i>Don't forget
to add cosmetics
for flavor.</i>

04:47.243 --> 04:50.681
<i>You'll be surprised
what tools you'll find
just lying around the house.</i>

04:50.725 --> 04:53.554
<i>All right, it's time
for today's topic.</i>

04:53.597 --> 04:56.208
<i>Souls.
Do robots have them?</i>

04:58.385 --> 05:01.605
<i>It is our belief
that anything with memories
has a soul.</i>

05:01.649 --> 05:04.695
<i>And boy,
do robots have memory.
Am I right?</i>

05:04.739 --> 05:07.698
<i>You've heard from us,
now we wanna hear from you.</i>

05:07.742 --> 05:10.353
<i>Chime in down below
in the comments.</i>

05:10.397 --> 05:14.792
Interesting query, ladies.
But I think I'm just
about finished.

05:17.969 --> 05:20.407
Why aren't
you turning on?

05:20.450 --> 05:21.843
Hmm...

05:21.886 --> 05:25.150
It's time to call in
the big guns.

05:26.543 --> 05:28.284
<i>Hello!
How's it going?</i>

05:28.328 --> 05:31.592
<i>Uh, hi.
My name's Polly.
Big fan.</i>

05:31.635 --> 05:34.421
<i>Long story short,
I have a bit
of a robotics issue.</i>

05:34.464 --> 05:36.074
<i>Oh, my gosh!</i>

05:36.118 --> 05:37.424
<i>Is that a robot?</i>

05:37.467 --> 05:38.947
<i>He's beautiful.</i>

05:40.340 --> 05:41.819
<i>Out of my way,
Pandatron.</i>

05:41.863 --> 05:43.386
<i>Tell us everything.</i>

05:43.430 --> 05:46.171
Well, he had a bit
of an accident.

05:46.215 --> 05:49.044
I think I've done a pretty
sweet job of putting him
back together,

05:49.087 --> 05:50.828
but he just
isn't powering on.

05:50.872 --> 05:52.961
<i>Well, what are you using
as a power source?</i>

05:53.004 --> 05:55.616
<i>I just took some batteries
out of the TV remote.</i>

05:55.659 --> 05:58.096
<i>Oh, no.
That will never
be enough.</i>

05:58.140 --> 06:01.404
<i>You could try a battery module
with a compatible connector
and corresponding voltage.</i>

06:01.448 --> 06:04.886
<i>Like the kind they put in
those creepy animatronic
children's toys.</i>

06:04.929 --> 06:08.498
I think I've got
just the thing.

06:08.542 --> 06:12.241
<i>Oh, but Polly,
I definitely wouldn't
turn him on in your garage.</i>

06:12.284 --> 06:15.113
<i>Yeah, you'd need to be
in a big space,
like a warehouse,</i>

06:15.157 --> 06:17.333
<i>and have tons
of fire extinguishers.</i>

06:17.377 --> 06:20.902
<i>That thing looks like
it's capable of a lot
of output.</i>

06:20.945 --> 06:23.470
<i>I'll say it again.
Do not do this at home.</i>

06:23.513 --> 06:25.602
<i>Heck, we can actually
help you rent a space.</i>

06:25.646 --> 06:27.561
<i>It'll take a couple
of weeks, but we--
Thanks, girls.</i>

06:27.604 --> 06:30.433
<i>I'll take that
into consideration.
Bye!</i>

06:30.477 --> 06:32.130
<i>Do you think
she's gonna turn
that thing on?</i>

06:32.174 --> 06:33.480
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

06:35.569 --> 06:38.398
<i>Just a nibble. I swear.</i>

06:44.969 --> 06:48.886
This is it.
When I hit this button,
he'll be back.

06:48.930 --> 06:51.454
I should get the fam.

06:51.498 --> 06:54.805
<i>I hate gravel.
It's bumpy and bothersome.
And it gets everywhere.</i>

06:54.849 --> 06:56.024
<i>I love you.</i>

06:57.939 --> 06:59.854
I still can't believe
you guys like
the prequels more.

06:59.897 --> 07:02.247
Look, Anne,
we just watched them
in order with no context.

07:02.291 --> 07:04.467
You can't blame us
for not having nostalgia.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.469
I did it!
I fixed him!

07:06.513 --> 07:08.123
You what?

07:08.166 --> 07:09.646
I thought you were looking
at cat videos.

07:09.690 --> 07:12.127
Gosh! Dang it, Polly!
You outfoxed me again.

07:12.170 --> 07:13.650
There was deception, yes.

07:13.694 --> 07:15.609
But I got help on the Internet,

07:15.652 --> 07:17.393
and now if I press
this button,
he'll be back.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.830
Yay, right?
Say it with me now.

07:19.874 --> 07:21.702
Yay!

07:21.745 --> 07:23.486
Didn't I forbid you
from working on him?

07:23.530 --> 07:26.141
It's way too dangerous
for you to be messing around

07:26.184 --> 07:27.838
with things
you don't understand.

07:27.882 --> 07:29.753
Yeah, my hair is still singed

07:29.797 --> 07:32.103
from the last time you
"knew what you were doing."

07:32.147 --> 07:34.715
What if when you turn
him on this time,
he blows off your legs?

07:34.758 --> 07:35.977
You just got your legs.

07:36.020 --> 07:37.761
It's awesome
that you fixed him,

07:37.805 --> 07:39.415
but I think we should wait

07:39.459 --> 07:40.547
till we get back to Amphibia
to turn him on.

07:40.590 --> 07:41.678
Just to be safe.

07:41.722 --> 07:43.071
Seconded.
Thirded.

07:43.114 --> 07:45.116
I don't believe this!

07:45.160 --> 07:47.118
After all of the work
I've done,

07:47.162 --> 07:51.427
after how much I've missed him,
you three wanna leave him dead?

07:51.471 --> 07:53.908
Well,
who needs you guys?

07:53.951 --> 07:55.997
Wait! Polly,
get back here!

07:56.040 --> 07:57.781
Polly,
don't do it!

07:57.825 --> 07:59.653
It could be dangerous!

07:59.696 --> 08:02.656
I ain't waiting another second
to see my best friend again.

08:05.833 --> 08:06.790
Polly!

08:07.965 --> 08:09.793
All right!
One more hit,

08:09.837 --> 08:11.969
and this ten-hour boss battle
will finally be over.

08:19.586 --> 08:21.239
<i>Start up engage.</i>

08:21.283 --> 08:25.243
<i>Model number F0-R1.
Factory settings restored.</i>

08:25.287 --> 08:29.378
Frobo, is that you?
It's me. Polly.

08:29.421 --> 08:31.336
<i>Username not recognized.</i>

08:31.380 --> 08:33.556
<i>Will now attempt
to make contact
with headquarters.</i>

08:33.600 --> 08:35.689
<i>A higher vantage point
is necessary.</i>

08:35.732 --> 08:37.125
A higher vantage point?

08:37.168 --> 08:38.169
Whoa!

08:44.611 --> 08:46.613
Hang on, Polly!

08:47.788 --> 08:49.659
Oh, no. Look!

08:51.792 --> 08:53.924
<i>-Booster malfunction detected.</i>

08:53.968 --> 08:55.709
Oh! That can't be good.

08:59.974 --> 09:04.282
Hey, do you guys know Polly?
Little kid, has a tail,
built a crazy robot?

09:06.067 --> 09:07.198
Oh, my gosh!

09:08.286 --> 09:09.592
Frobo!

09:09.636 --> 09:11.507
We're in big trouble!

09:12.639 --> 09:16.730
Please, it's me! Polly.
You've got to remember.

09:17.774 --> 09:20.821
Oh, Frobo.
I just missed you
so much.

09:20.864 --> 09:22.823
And now we're both
gonna die.

09:22.866 --> 09:25.303
I'm so sorry.

09:31.701 --> 09:34.138
I will call you Frobo.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.448
Can we please keep him?
I'll be his big sister.

09:39.491 --> 09:41.581
<i>Polly, I will save you.</i>

09:44.235 --> 09:46.629
Frobo!

09:49.676 --> 09:51.765
<i>Po-- Polly.</i>

09:51.808 --> 09:53.680
Frobo, you're back!

09:53.723 --> 09:54.681
Yay!

09:54.724 --> 09:56.117
Quick, do something!

09:56.160 --> 09:57.466
We're about to hit the ground!

10:15.484 --> 10:16.528
She's okay!

10:16.572 --> 10:17.878
Oh, thank frog!

10:20.271 --> 10:21.882
You guys were right.

10:21.925 --> 10:24.580
I was so impatient
with bringing him
back to life

10:24.624 --> 10:26.713
that I killed him
all over again.

10:27.931 --> 10:30.151
<i>Po-- Polly.</i>

10:33.502 --> 10:35.896
Frobo!

10:35.939 --> 10:38.246
You big,
lovable lug.

10:38.289 --> 10:41.553
I'll fix you right this time
and be slow and careful.

10:41.597 --> 10:43.294
No matter how much
I miss ya.

10:44.513 --> 10:45.775
Aw!

10:45.819 --> 10:47.690
Sturdy!
Impressive!

10:47.734 --> 10:50.127
Looks like his hard drive
is still in one piece
at least.

10:50.171 --> 10:52.739
I think next time,
we just need to tune
the PID controllers.

10:52.782 --> 10:56.307
Oh, yeah! Increase his lateral
and longitudinal stability.

10:56.351 --> 10:58.396
Totally.
Hmm.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.964
I'm just curious.
What was the covariance
of the pose estimate

11:01.008 --> 11:02.487
coming out of
the SLAM module?

11:02.531 --> 11:04.925
Simultaneous Localization
And Mapping? Well...

11:04.968 --> 11:07.188
Wow, Polly really got into
this computer stuff, huh?

11:07.231 --> 11:11.279
Hmm. Maybe we shoulda
used the interwebs
to educate ourselves too,

11:11.322 --> 11:13.411
instead of
watching cat videos.

11:14.238 --> 11:16.501
Did someone say
cat videos?

11:16.545 --> 11:19.766
♪ <i>Meow, meow, meow, meow
Meow, meow, meow, meow♪</i>

11:21.637 --> 11:22.856
Ain't that cute?

11:22.899 --> 11:24.858
The backyard!
