What is it?

02:47.959 --> 02:52.419
The problem is,
this was a rehab of a shaft,

02:52.547 --> 02:54.917
and that’s the way
Dumas approached this project,

02:55.050 --> 02:57.890

of it was,

02:58.011 --> 02:59.891
"No, this is
a mining operation,"

02:59.971 --> 03:02.141
so that’s
where the disconnect happened.

03:02.224 --> 03:05.944
And the rules for mining are
a bit tighter than the rules

03:06.061 --> 03:09.231

just a shaft rehabilitation.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.893

to the same era</i>

Lot 8 is no different.

12:25.954 --> 12:28.214
Lot 8 might be even better
for one simple reason:

12:28.289 --> 12:30.249
it was never occupied.

12:31.042 --> 12:33.002
<i>There was never a house there.</i>

-Yeah.

13:20.174 --> 13:21.724
<i>...the Oak Island team

<i>of all of Oak Island’s
32 four-acre lots.</i>

13:29.183 --> 13:33.023
So, the unit is known as EM31-8.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.316
-Okay. Mm-hmm.
-It is
a near production prototype.

13:36.399 --> 13:38.689
But, uh, it’s based on, uh,
an older technology

13:38.818 --> 13:40.858
that’s been around
for a few decades now.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.235
It’s just kind of
a new riff on it.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.413
What it measures
is conductivity,

13:44.532 --> 13:48.082
and it’s gonna collect that data
down to a depth of 30 feet.

13:48.202 --> 13:50.752
-Cool.
-JEREMY: So, you know,

13:50.872 --> 13:52.752
wherever you’re gonna have
metallic objects on the island,

13:52.874 --> 13:54.884
obviously, this thing’s gonna
pick it up real nice.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.751
But you also could be
picking up things

13:56.878 --> 13:59.548
like old foundations where
the soil has been disturbed,

13:59.630 --> 14:01.470
or there’s large anomalies.

14:01.549 --> 14:04.429
These are all gonna be clues
to the activity of,

14:04.552 --> 14:06.392
you know, previous occupants
of the island.

14:06.512 --> 14:09.062
-Sounds good.
-Yeah.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.432
We were talking about,
what are we doing in the swamp?

14:11.559 --> 14:13.019
That’s-that’s
my first suggestion.

14:13.102 --> 14:14.272
MARTY:
No, that’s spot-on, Alex,

14:14.395 --> 14:15.685
’cause it’s warm right now,

14:15.772 --> 14:17.482
-but the bugs aren’t out yet.
-Mm-hmm.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.435
MARTY:
That would be
a really good place to start.

14:19.567 --> 14:22.107
And you could take it in a boat,
no problem, right?

14:22.236 --> 14:24.106
Yeah. Definitely.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.528
ALEX:
Another reason
for starting with the swamp is

14:26.616 --> 14:29.656
a couple years back you guys had
that ship-shaped anomaly, uh,

14:29.744 --> 14:32.294
in the swamp,
and we tried to dig it.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.333
Uh, we didn’t have
a lot of success,

14:34.415 --> 14:36.745
but if this equipment can give
us another look at that area,

14:36.876 --> 14:39.126
just to confirm,
and hopefully get

14:39.253 --> 14:41.843
-more meaningful information
that way.
-JEREMY: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

14:44.342 --> 14:46.472
<i>NARRATOR:
It was during
a seismic scanning operation,</i>

14:46.594 --> 14:49.104
<i>conducted in 2018</i>

14:49.180 --> 14:52.430
<i>by Jeremy and his colleagues
from Eagle Canada</i>

14:52.517 --> 14:54.767
<i>that identified
a massive anomaly</i>

14:54.894 --> 14:58.064
<i>resembling the size and shape
of an ancient galleon ship</i>

15:02.610 --> 15:04.280
<i>just what the feature is,</i>

15:04.404 --> 15:07.494
<i>since then, they’ve unearthed
numerous pieces</i>

<i>of believed sailing vessels</i>

<i>to as early

15:15.706 --> 15:18.826
<i>Now it is the team’s hope
that Jeremy and Burton</i>

15:18.960 --> 15:23.670
<i>can identify new clues,
not only on dry land</i>

15:23.798 --> 15:26.968
<i>but also in the swamp,

15:27.093 --> 15:28.843
<i>new permits to drain it</i>

15:28.970 --> 15:32.510
<i>and confirm

to solving that mystery?

from you early on

So, how’s it going to work?

16:23.149 --> 16:26.239
Really the key to all this is
getting good lines.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.740
It’s all about the grid
that we do.

16:27.862 --> 16:29.072
We need really a tight grid,

16:29.197 --> 16:30.817
so we don’t miss
any small anomalies.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.867
And that’s part of
the reason why Tony’s gonna be

16:32.992 --> 16:34.412
in the water
rather than rowing.

16:34.535 --> 16:37.535
Yeah, but to get

19:46.310 --> 19:48.060

19:48.145 --> 19:51.435

the swamp that’s intriguing.

19:51.565 --> 19:54.645
<i>We have
the enigmatic stone road</i>

19:54.735 --> 19:56.985
<i>that anyone could tell is
a man-made feature</i>

19:57.071 --> 20:00.201
<i>and doesn’t make any sense
to be in a swamp.</i>

20:00.282 --> 20:02.202
<i>We have bits of wood that have</i>

20:02.284 --> 20:04.584
<i>very peculiar dates on them
from the swamp.</i>

20:04.704 --> 20:08.004
So,
in order to finish this quest,

20:08.082 --> 20:10.252
we have to finish the swamp.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.210
You seeing anything?

20:13.295 --> 20:15.505
It’s going really well,
and yes, we are.

20:15.589 --> 20:18.259

-JEREMY: Yeah, it does
somewhat correlate

20:18.342 --> 20:21.512
with the seismic anomaly
from a couple years back.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.675
-Interesting. Yeah.
-Very interesting.

20:23.764 --> 20:26.144
Tony, when you... when you’re
going across those areas

20:26.267 --> 20:29.187

feeling anything with your feet?

20:29.270 --> 20:31.860
I can feel the density
of the bottom change.

20:31.939 --> 20:34.109
So, similar over
the last few years,

20:34.233 --> 20:36.443

the stone walkway

20:36.527 --> 20:38.697

20:38.779 --> 20:40.659
Yeah. That’s-that’s
really exciting.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.951
That many hits in this...
just this small area

20:43.075 --> 20:44.985

really encouraging.

20:45.119 --> 20:49.039

39:15.895 --> 39:17.145
we’re looking at right now,
straight down.

39:17.230 --> 39:18.980
And the hole came down
very close to

39:19.065 --> 39:20.725
the wall of the cave,
we’ll call it.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.149
And I think
that’s what we see whenever

39:22.235 --> 39:23.655
we’re looking horizontally.

39:23.736 --> 39:26.656
Okay, put it at 90
and take a loop.

39:32.245 --> 39:33.755
Think that’s the wall?
The nearest wall?

39:33.872 --> 39:35.212
SCOTT:
I think that’s
what we’re seeing.

39:35.290 --> 39:37.290
Some sort of structure
close to the hole.

39:37.417 --> 39:40.207
I think it has the possibility
of not being natural.

39:41.170 --> 39:43.960
<i>I’d really love to
explain the cavernous area,</i>

39:44.090 --> 39:47.680
but I am, uh, I’m a little lost
on this thing.

39:47.760 --> 39:49.970
<i>I don’t see a mechanism,
a natural mechanism</i>

39:50.096 --> 39:52.516
<i>to have been created.</i>

39:52.599 --> 39:56.809
<i>So, it’s a long shot,
but this could be the chamber.</i>

39:56.936 --> 39:59.686
<i>So we need to know everything
that’s inside this thing.</i>

39:59.772 --> 40:01.152
We can rotate it around,

40:01.274 --> 40:02.194
then we can kind of see
into the abyss.

40:04.110 --> 40:05.860
You can’t focus on that
any better?

40:05.945 --> 40:07.105
Let’s try.

40:09.115 --> 40:10.865
MARTY:
I don’t see anything.

40:10.950 --> 40:12.700
Okay. So, we have
a decision to make.

40:12.785 --> 40:15.285
I need more data,
if we’re gonna explore this.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.333
RICK:
To me, it just simply says

40:16.456 --> 40:18.286
we need the mapping sonar

40:18.416 --> 40:20.456
if you’re ever gonna learn
anything at all about this.

40:20.543 --> 40:22.043
Correct.
If we have a sonar,

40:22.128 --> 40:25.088
-a 3D sonar, I would run it.
-Okay.

40:25.173 --> 40:27.223
<i>RICK:
It’s huge. It’s remarkable.</i>

40:27.300 --> 40:30.050
<i>I think that
what we need to do is understand</i>

40:30.136 --> 40:34.556
<i>the size of this void,
the floor, the ceiling,</i>

40:34.641 --> 40:37.481
<i>the orientation with
the other knowns in the area.</i>

40:37.560 --> 40:40.690
We need to get 3D mapping sonar

40:40.813 --> 40:44.693
down into that hole
and map that entire void.

40:44.817 --> 40:47.277
-We’re done here.
-Okay.

40:47.362 --> 40:49.412
Spool it all up.
On to the next thing.

40:49.489 --> 40:52.659
<i>-Thank you, guys.
-STEVE G.: Thanks, guys.</i>

40:52.784 --> 40:55.294
<i>NARRATOR:
In spite of
a frustrating setback</i>

40:55.370 --> 40:57.790
<i>with
the Garden Shaft excavation,</i>

40:57.872 --> 41:01.082
<i>Rick, Marty, Craig
and their team continue</i>

41:01.167 --> 41:04.667
<i>to forge ahead with possible
breakthrough discoveries</i>

41:04.796 --> 41:07.836
<i>and potentially
history-changing revelations.</i>

41:07.924 --> 41:11.724
<i>Could it be that the origins
of the Oak Island mystery</i>

41:11.844 --> 41:15.934
<i>stretch back even further in
time than anyone ever imagined?</i>

41:16.015 --> 41:19.435
<i>Perhaps that question
can only be answered</i>

41:19.519 --> 41:21.599
<i>by locating the treasure
that has been detected</i>

41:21.688 --> 41:23.478
<i>in the Money Pit.</i>

41:23.564 --> 41:26.944
<i>And there is no force
powerful enough on Oak Island</i>

41:27.026 --> 41:31.356
<i>that will stop this team
from trying to find it.</i>

41:35.034 --> 41:37.664
<i>Next time on</i>
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:37.745 --> 41:39.705
-ALEX: Sonar’s set up.
-STEVE G.: Let’s get it
down hole.

41:39.831 --> 41:41.791
-PAUL: Yeah, there it is.
-SCOTT: It is
a significant opening.

41:41.874 --> 41:44.044
This could be
the off-set chamber.

41:44.168 --> 41:47.548
Another anomaly was this one in
the northern tip of the swamp.

41:47.672 --> 41:49.632
<i>TOM:
Awfully close to
the Eye of the Swamp.</i>

41:49.716 --> 41:51.046
Would a metal box give you that?

41:51.175 --> 41:53.005
-Oh, for sure. Yeah.
-MARTY: Wow.

41:53.094 --> 41:56.684
<i>We have managed
to purchase Lot 5.</i>

41:56.764 --> 41:59.934
-(beeping)
-Oh. Ooh!

42:00.059 --> 42:01.309
-Look at that!
-Wow.

42:01.394 --> 42:03.194
That’s treasure, mate.

42:03.980 --> 42:06.360
