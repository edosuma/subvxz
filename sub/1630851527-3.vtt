02:35.120 --> 02:36.535
Hello, Mr. Herriot.

02:36.570 --> 02:38.296
Hello, Tom.

02:38.330 --> 02:39.918
Good of you to help out
the Dalbys like this.

02:39.952 --> 02:42.748
They've always been good
friends of my grandparents.

02:42.783 --> 02:44.509
Mrs. Dalby's up in the field.

02:44.543 --> 02:46.096
I'll take you.

02:46.131 --> 02:48.927
[soft music]

02:56.728 --> 02:58.108
Thanks, Tom.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.215
Morning, Mr. Herriot.

03:01.250 --> 03:03.528
Thanks for coming out to see us.

03:03.562 --> 03:06.669
And thank you for
being there yesterday.

03:06.703 --> 03:08.049
Billy was a good man.

03:08.084 --> 03:09.948
I wanted to pay my respects.

03:09.982 --> 03:11.950
[cow mooing]

03:11.984 --> 03:14.746
Their breathing don't
sound right, Mr. Herriot.

03:14.780 --> 03:16.230
They were really fit
when they turned out

03:16.265 --> 03:17.714
earlier this month.

03:17.749 --> 03:19.958
Then, well.

03:21.580 --> 03:24.963
Let's have a look,
then, shall we?

03:50.575 --> 03:53.060
The stirks have got
husk, I'm afraid.

03:53.854 --> 03:56.650
For an older cow, this
may not be a problem,

03:56.684 --> 03:57.720
but as they are still so young.

03:57.754 --> 04:00.895
Aye, and what is husk, exactly?

04:00.930 --> 04:03.277
Well, it's a parasite.

04:03.312 --> 04:05.762
A tiny worm which infests
the bronchial tubes

04:05.797 --> 04:07.385
and sets up bronchitis.

04:07.419 --> 04:11.216
In fact, that's the problem,
parasitic bronchitis.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.494
The larvae climb up
the blades of grass

04:13.529 --> 04:15.703
and the cattle eat
them as they graze.

04:15.738 --> 04:18.154
Some pastures are
badly affected with it.

04:20.329 --> 04:22.986
I'm sorry but they're
pretty bad, Mrs. Dalby.

04:23.677 --> 04:25.195
A mild attack isn't so bad

04:25.230 --> 04:26.680
if you can get them off
the grass right away,

04:26.714 --> 04:29.407
but this has gone a
long way beyond that.

04:31.029 --> 04:32.927
What can we do about
it, Mr. Herriot?

04:32.962 --> 04:35.482
For a start, we can get
them all inside immediately.

04:35.516 --> 04:38.864
Every mouthful of this grass
is adding to the worm burden.

04:38.899 --> 04:41.522
Right you are, Mr. Herriot.

04:43.352 --> 04:48.046
Can I tempt you with
the last egg, Mrs. H?

04:49.185 --> 04:50.359
No thanks.

04:50.393 --> 04:52.015
Seems a shame to waste it.

04:54.155 --> 04:55.674
I thought you'd be
joining your friends

04:55.709 --> 04:57.331
down in London for the cricket.

04:57.366 --> 04:58.712
Yes, I thought so too,

04:58.746 --> 05:01.335
but unfortunately
tickets require money

05:01.370 --> 05:04.614
and money requires wages,
neither of which I possess.

05:04.649 --> 05:07.376
So instead, my plan is
three uninterrupted days

05:07.410 --> 05:10.655
with my feet up, the radio on,
and a lovely, cool glass of--

05:10.689 --> 05:12.242
Well, it took all of five hours,

05:12.277 --> 05:15.176
but Gladys produced a
whopping 18 piglets.

05:15.211 --> 05:16.971
Darrowby record, I believe.

05:17.006 --> 05:18.663
Smells like one, too.

05:18.697 --> 05:19.802
They need cleaning.

05:19.836 --> 05:21.148
Get them off.

05:21.182 --> 05:22.391
Any chance of some breakfast?

05:22.425 --> 05:24.531
I can make you a bacon sandwich.
And those.

05:24.565 --> 05:27.257
I think I've had enough pig for
one day. Got any eggs?

05:32.159 --> 05:34.057
You can have the rest of
this one, if you like.

05:34.092 --> 05:36.370
So I'm out working
my trousers off

05:36.405 --> 05:38.855
while you're lazing
around stuffing your face

05:38.890 --> 05:40.374
with my hard-earned eggs?

05:40.409 --> 05:42.065
Such is life, big brother.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.895
-Such is life.
-Go and get changed.

05:43.929 --> 05:45.379
I'll make you some toast.

05:46.207 --> 05:48.382
[cat meowing]

05:48.417 --> 05:50.729
You really didn't need to
go to all this trouble.

05:50.764 --> 05:52.179
Nonsense.

05:52.213 --> 05:53.629
I hope that tea isn't
too strong for you.

05:53.663 --> 05:56.494
It's perfect.
Thank you, Mrs. Dalby.

05:56.528 --> 05:58.358
I'll be back up tomorrow
to check on the stirks.

05:58.392 --> 06:01.395
Meanwhile, it's very important
that you keep them inside.

06:01.430 --> 06:03.984
Oh. But they'll need feeding.

06:04.018 --> 06:05.572
Well, at this point,

06:05.606 --> 06:08.713
I would start by giving
them the best possible food,

06:08.747 --> 06:11.785
good hay and high-protein cake.

06:11.819 --> 06:13.234
Cake?

06:13.269 --> 06:15.927
[scoffing] That's
expensive stuff, isn't it?

06:15.961 --> 06:17.273
And if we give them the hay now,

06:17.307 --> 06:18.930
then we'll need to
buy more for winter.

06:18.964 --> 06:20.276
I know,

06:20.310 --> 06:22.727
but a good diet is our
best hope at this stage.

06:22.761 --> 06:26.213
And they can't go out to
feed on the grass, ever?

06:26.247 --> 06:28.664
No.
I'm sorry, not on those fields.

06:28.698 --> 06:30.562
If it was a mild attack, you
could have turned them out

06:30.597 --> 06:33.185
after the dew had
left in the mornings,

06:33.220 --> 06:36.637
-but that's not the case here.
-Right.

06:37.535 --> 06:38.846
Well, thank you, Mr. Herriot.

06:38.881 --> 06:40.676
We know where we are anyway.

06:40.710 --> 06:42.816
Billy, love, why don't you
take your brother outside

06:42.850 --> 06:44.334
for a kickaround?

06:44.369 --> 06:45.853
Have we got a young Gordon
Hodgson in the making?

06:45.888 --> 06:47.027
He's my favorite player.

06:47.061 --> 06:48.131
Good choice.

06:48.166 --> 06:50.099
Go on, Billy, love.

06:50.927 --> 06:52.895
-Oi, you.
-[Billy giggling]

06:52.929 --> 06:54.793
-Excuse me.
-Come on.

06:54.828 --> 06:56.036
So cheeky.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.733
Do you think we can save them?

07:03.768 --> 07:05.908
Well, we can always hope.

07:05.942 --> 07:07.254
[somber music]

07:07.288 --> 07:10.533
[scoffing] Funny.

07:10.568 --> 07:13.812
That's what my Billy
always used to say.

07:13.847 --> 07:15.365
He was ever the optimist.

07:16.228 --> 07:17.678
Even when the doctor
said it was cancer,

07:17.713 --> 07:19.715
Billy still insisted
he'd be fine.

07:24.167 --> 07:27.032
Time is so fleeting,
Mr. Herriot.

07:36.421 --> 07:38.388
Any other calls come in?

07:38.423 --> 07:39.528
Nothing.

07:40.701 --> 07:41.978
Shame.

07:42.013 --> 07:43.704
I guess we will be
taking a day off.

07:43.739 --> 07:45.119
Not so fast.

07:45.154 --> 07:46.949
-Equipment needs polishing.
-Done.

07:46.983 --> 07:48.157
Well, then the medicines
need topping up.

07:48.191 --> 07:49.503
Done, all done.

07:49.538 --> 07:51.367
Play starts in five
minutes, Mrs. H.

07:51.401 --> 07:53.300
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What about the...

07:55.129 --> 07:57.269
What's wrong with Tristan
enjoying the cricket?

07:57.304 --> 08:00.031
He spent all last night
polishing and topping things up.

08:00.065 --> 08:01.791
There's always more to be done.

08:01.826 --> 08:04.207
Lambing season's almost over.

08:04.242 --> 08:05.692
Summer's our quietest
time of year.

08:05.726 --> 08:08.349
Surely the lad's earned
a day or two off now.

08:09.454 --> 08:10.662
Earned?

08:10.697 --> 08:13.009
Well, now he's passed
his exams and all.

08:13.044 --> 08:16.012
[bright music]

08:25.090 --> 08:28.024
[birds chirping]

08:39.449 --> 08:40.830
Oh!

08:40.865 --> 08:43.074
James, I'm so sorry,
I didn't see you there.

08:43.108 --> 08:44.627
I've probably had
worse flung at me.

08:44.662 --> 08:46.146
[Helen chuckling]

08:46.180 --> 08:49.874
I wanted to drop in and see
how you were after yesterday.

08:49.908 --> 08:52.497
Oh, I'm all right, thanks.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.844
It's Phyllis we're
worried about.

08:54.879 --> 08:57.122
I was just over there now.

08:57.157 --> 08:58.814
Her stirks have got husk.

08:58.848 --> 09:01.782
Oh, on top of everything else.

09:01.817 --> 09:03.335
We offered to help
her out with the kids,

09:03.370 --> 09:06.615
but she's determined
she can manage.

09:06.649 --> 09:10.480
Our Jenny was around the same
age as Billy when my mam died.

09:10.515 --> 09:13.311
All the things that family
never got to do together.

09:14.830 --> 09:16.590
Now they never will.

09:16.625 --> 09:19.766
Must have brought back a
lot of painful memories.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.837
Life's cruel sometimes.

09:21.871 --> 09:24.322
[soft music]

09:26.082 --> 09:28.533
-Be seeing you again soon?
-I hope so.

09:30.673 --> 09:32.744
What are you doing
tomorrow night?

09:32.779 --> 09:35.885
Going out with you,
by the sounds of it.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.854
I could pick you up at seven?

09:38.888 --> 09:40.269
I'd like that.

09:46.689 --> 09:49.658
[radio chattering]

10:01.531 --> 10:03.188
-Come on, Hutton!
-[hands slapping]

10:03.223 --> 10:04.742
Make us proud.

10:05.915 --> 10:07.365
[bell dinging]

10:07.399 --> 10:09.816
-[Richard] I'll get it.
-[crowd applauding]

10:09.850 --> 10:12.577
[light music]

10:14.821 --> 10:15.856
Thank you.

10:19.653 --> 10:20.861
What on earth?

10:20.896 --> 10:22.311
Tristan, just the man.

10:22.345 --> 10:23.830
Help me carry these
out to the barn.

10:23.864 --> 10:25.866
-What's going on?
-You'll see.

10:33.771 --> 10:35.048
Lovely.

10:35.738 --> 10:36.808
Ugh.

10:38.085 --> 10:40.847
Now, one cannot be a great vet

10:40.881 --> 10:44.022
until one has reared
one's own animals.

10:44.057 --> 10:45.886
Funny, never heard
that one before.

10:45.921 --> 10:46.887
Mm-hm.

10:46.922 --> 10:49.441
So here you are, Tristan.

10:49.476 --> 10:51.651
Meet your new brood.

10:55.378 --> 10:56.414
-Wait, what?
-[chickens clucking]

10:56.448 --> 10:58.243
Such is life, little brother.

10:58.278 --> 11:01.246
May I suggest you make a start
building a nest box for them?

11:01.281 --> 11:02.627
A nest box?

11:02.662 --> 11:04.353
Nothing like a fresh
egg, warm from the nest.

11:04.387 --> 11:07.701
[upbeat music]

11:07.736 --> 11:11.878
Hang on, how come James never
had to rear his own animals?

11:17.815 --> 11:20.472
[bell dinging]

11:21.750 --> 11:24.304
This better not be
a flock of sheep.

11:25.339 --> 11:26.893
[whimsical music]

11:26.927 --> 11:29.274
Is Uncle Herriot here?

11:29.309 --> 11:33.071
No, Uncle Mr. Herriot
is not here, I'm afraid.

11:33.106 --> 11:34.659
As I'm sure you're aware,

11:34.694 --> 11:36.350
Mrs. Pumphrey is attending
the Test match in London

11:36.385 --> 11:39.319
and I am under
strict instruction

11:39.353 --> 11:41.493
into his guardianship
for the duration.

11:43.116 --> 11:46.015
I'm sure Mr. Farnon can
provide temporary guardianship

11:46.050 --> 11:47.914
until Uncle Herriot returns.

11:47.948 --> 11:49.156
Most kind.

11:52.056 --> 11:54.852
[dog growling]

11:56.681 --> 11:59.546
[engine starting]

12:06.035 --> 12:07.485
[Announcer] Now the evening sun

12:07.519 --> 12:09.590
sends long shadows
over the gasometers,

12:09.625 --> 12:11.938
-Hutton has reached 150,
-[chickens clucking]

12:11.972 --> 12:15.458
and with Leyland by his side,
looks like going on to 1,000.

12:16.218 --> 12:19.014
[wood clattering]

12:19.048 --> 12:21.361
Oh, thought you were Siegfried.

12:21.395 --> 12:22.949
Since when do we have hens?

12:22.983 --> 12:24.398
Since my big brother decided

12:24.433 --> 12:26.228
I need to rear my own animals.

12:26.262 --> 12:27.919
-What for?
-Exactly.

12:27.954 --> 12:29.990
I thought now that I'm
a fully qualified vet,

12:30.025 --> 12:31.647
he'd finally stop hectoring me.

12:31.681 --> 12:33.960
Perhaps he just doesn't
know how to yet.

12:33.994 --> 12:35.547
I don't know.

12:35.582 --> 12:38.240
Doesn't seem to matter what
I do, it's never enough.

12:39.413 --> 12:41.761
Then why don't you try
standing up to him?

12:41.795 --> 12:43.038
Worked for me.

12:43.072 --> 12:45.316
-You make it sound easy.
-Perhaps it is.

12:45.350 --> 12:47.387
Have you met my brother?

12:49.769 --> 12:53.117
-What is this supposed to be?
-A nest box?

12:53.945 --> 12:55.326
Give it here.

13:05.198 --> 13:07.821
How was your visit
to the Dalbys?

13:07.856 --> 13:10.237
-It's not looking good.
-Oh, dear.

13:14.103 --> 13:16.036
This is Maggie, by the way.

13:16.071 --> 13:17.624
Say hello, Maggie.

13:17.658 --> 13:20.558
And, oh, look,
that one here's Brenda.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.836
Let me guess, they're all named
after your ex-girlfriends.

13:22.871 --> 13:24.493
No, not at all.

13:25.874 --> 13:27.151
Here she is.

13:27.185 --> 13:29.981
This is Helen, especially
for you, James.

13:30.016 --> 13:31.603
Who knows?

13:31.638 --> 13:34.296
This one might even let you
take her out [chuckling].

13:34.330 --> 13:35.849
I'll have you know
that Helen and I

13:35.884 --> 13:38.507
are going out on a
date tomorrow night.

13:38.541 --> 13:39.473
James!

13:39.508 --> 13:41.544
That's fantastic, sorry, news!

13:41.579 --> 13:43.823
And where are you
taking the lovely Helen?

13:43.857 --> 13:45.686
Probably just the Drovers.

13:45.721 --> 13:47.033
The Drovers?

13:47.067 --> 13:50.588
Look, tomorrow is your big
chance to finally impress Helen.

13:50.622 --> 13:52.210
You should take her
to the Renniston.

13:52.245 --> 13:54.868
Trust me, women like
to be wined and dined.

13:54.903 --> 13:56.145
I don't know.

13:56.180 --> 13:57.388
Seems a bit grand.

13:57.422 --> 13:58.803
Can't you see it, Jim?

13:58.838 --> 14:01.841
The music oozing out of
Benny Thornton's trombone

14:01.875 --> 14:03.049
and you full of champagne,

14:03.083 --> 14:05.258
and Helen leaning
across the table,

14:05.292 --> 14:07.847
the look of love in her eyes.

14:07.881 --> 14:10.194
Oh, kiss me, Helen...
[kissing]

14:11.091 --> 14:12.644
-[wings flapping]
-Oh, OK.

14:12.679 --> 14:14.577
[James laughing]

14:14.612 --> 14:15.440
Maybe.

14:15.475 --> 14:17.028
I mean, after Hugh,

14:17.063 --> 14:19.859
she is probably more used
to the finer things in life.

14:20.825 --> 14:23.448
[light music]

14:26.244 --> 14:29.213
[birds chirping]

14:38.187 --> 14:39.464
You still at it?

14:41.259 --> 14:43.365
Sorry.

14:43.399 --> 14:44.504
I'm still struggling
to find anything

14:44.538 --> 14:45.885
that might help Mrs. Dalby.

14:48.025 --> 14:49.233
Don't worry.

14:50.061 --> 14:53.237
Here, I'll make a fresh pot.

14:53.271 --> 14:55.584
Oh, Mrs. Hall, do you
have a spare stamp?

14:55.618 --> 14:57.793
Leave it here and
I'll post it for you.

14:57.827 --> 14:58.863
Thank you.

14:59.968 --> 15:03.764
-How is your mother?
-Still struggling.

15:03.799 --> 15:06.595
I'm just trying to help
out where I can, but it's.

15:06.629 --> 15:09.874
I'm sure she's grateful for
any help you can manage.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.704
I don't know. It still doesn't
feel like it's enough.

15:14.396 --> 15:16.605
To be honest, I just,

15:16.639 --> 15:18.020
I still have no idea
what I'm supposed to do

15:18.055 --> 15:19.297
about the Glasgow job.

15:21.506 --> 15:26.718
-[whimsical music]
-[dog panting]

15:33.898 --> 15:36.245
Tricki's finally
grown on you, then?

15:36.280 --> 15:37.729
Like a fungus.

15:37.764 --> 15:39.593
Well, he's definitely
taken a shine to you.

15:39.628 --> 15:42.113
I assure you I've given him
absolutely no reason to.

15:42.148 --> 15:44.357
Could say the same
about Tristan.

15:44.391 --> 15:45.979
He'd follow you to
the ends of the earth.

15:46.014 --> 15:47.325
Only to push me off.

15:47.360 --> 15:49.224
You unintelligent man.

15:49.258 --> 15:52.952
It amazes me how wide of the
mark you can be about Tristan.

15:57.577 --> 15:59.924
How are Phyllis's
stirks getting on?

15:59.959 --> 16:01.512
Not good.

16:01.546 --> 16:03.755
It's the worst case of
husk I think I've seen.

16:03.790 --> 16:05.240
What are you up to?

16:05.274 --> 16:06.966
So we've taken the
stirks off the field

16:07.000 --> 16:09.071
and I've suggested a
diet of hay and cake.

16:09.106 --> 16:10.417
Mm-hm.

16:10.452 --> 16:11.867
But without an effective
treatment to speak of,

16:11.901 --> 16:13.524
I'm a bit lost as to
what else I can do

16:13.558 --> 16:14.835
to try and save them.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.528
Perhaps you can't save them.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.600
No, every problem
has a solution.

16:20.634 --> 16:22.119
I just need to find it.

16:22.153 --> 16:25.225
I take it you've given
them the throat injection.

16:25.260 --> 16:27.296
That's just an
old farmer's tale.

16:27.331 --> 16:29.436
Don't say that to their faces.

16:29.471 --> 16:30.575
I don't want to give
her any more false hope

16:30.610 --> 16:32.888
than I already have done.

16:32.922 --> 16:35.166
And there's not much evidence to
suggest it actually helps.

16:35.201 --> 16:37.720
There's not much evidence
that it doesn't help, either.

16:37.755 --> 16:39.377
So what have you got to lose?

16:40.758 --> 16:41.724
Morning, all.

16:41.759 --> 16:43.726
-Morning.
-Morning, Tristan.

16:43.761 --> 16:45.038
-Morning, Tricki.
-[Tricki barking]

16:45.073 --> 16:46.039
Hello.

16:46.074 --> 16:47.489
[light music]

16:47.523 --> 16:49.353
Fresh eggs coming right up.

16:49.387 --> 16:51.458
We'll make a
poulterer of you yet.

16:56.946 --> 16:59.880
[kettle whistling]

17:05.403 --> 17:07.509
Good morning, ladies.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.237
What have you got for
me today, then, hey?

17:11.271 --> 17:12.790
[chickens clucking]

17:12.824 --> 17:15.344
[tense music]

17:20.004 --> 17:22.041
They're just getting
used to their new home.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.456
Poppycock, they're chickens.

17:23.490 --> 17:24.905
They don't know their
beak from their feet.

17:24.940 --> 17:26.286
It's your job to know
what's best for them.

17:26.321 --> 17:27.908
My job, exactly.

17:27.943 --> 17:29.634
And I say they just
need a bit of time

17:29.669 --> 17:30.704
and they'll figure it
out for themselves.

17:30.739 --> 17:32.258
What they need is guidance.

17:32.292 --> 17:34.053
Find yourself something
resembling an egg

17:34.087 --> 17:36.020
-then put it in the nest.
-No.

17:37.125 --> 17:38.402
No, what?

17:38.436 --> 17:39.817
No, I'm not listening
to you any more.

17:39.851 --> 17:41.267
You put me in charge
of these hens,

17:41.301 --> 17:42.958
so I'm going to do it my way.

17:42.992 --> 17:44.235
You're being ridiculous.

17:44.270 --> 17:45.926
And I can guarantee that
by tomorrow morning,

17:45.961 --> 17:48.964
these hens will have eggs coming
out of their...

17:48.998 --> 17:51.000
-[chicken clucks]
-...ears.

17:55.315 --> 17:56.696
[Tricki barking]

17:56.730 --> 17:58.180
-[Tricki squealing]
-[chickens clucking]

17:58.215 --> 18:00.803
Oh, damn it, you
stupid bloody animal.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.716
[somber music]

18:35.631 --> 18:36.805
Morning, Mrs. Dalby.

18:36.839 --> 18:38.496
-Hello.
-How are they today?

18:38.531 --> 18:40.153
Still fighting.

18:40.188 --> 18:43.191
I've been giving them the
cake and hay like you said.

18:43.225 --> 18:45.952
I emptied my penny
jar to pay for cake.

18:45.986 --> 18:47.195
You're a good lad, Billy.

18:47.229 --> 18:48.575
Your dad would be proud.

18:48.610 --> 18:51.544
Hey, Billy, give us
a hand with this.

18:51.578 --> 18:54.409
I actually dipped into
the family savings

18:54.443 --> 18:56.100
to pay for the cake.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.826
But Billy was so
desperate to help

18:57.860 --> 19:00.553
that I let him think
we used his pennies.

19:00.587 --> 19:02.313
Probably scatter them on the
farm when he's not looking,

19:02.348 --> 19:04.591
let him think he's found more.

19:04.626 --> 19:06.006
What about a throat injection?

19:06.041 --> 19:07.698
Farmers round here swear by it.

19:07.732 --> 19:09.078
We could try.

19:09.113 --> 19:12.012
It's a mix of chloroform,
turpentine, and creosote.

19:12.047 --> 19:13.669
There's no guarantee
that it will help.

19:13.704 --> 19:15.602
But we can always hope.

19:16.362 --> 19:18.053
Right, Mr. Herriot?

19:18.087 --> 19:19.330
Right, aye.

19:24.335 --> 19:26.648
Oh, it's nothing serious.

19:26.682 --> 19:28.270
Just a small cut,
by the looks of it.

19:28.305 --> 19:29.996
Well, thank God for that.

19:30.030 --> 19:32.688
Mrs. Pumphrey would have
our guts for garters.

19:32.723 --> 19:34.966
That'll teach him to get
involved with the chickens.

19:35.001 --> 19:36.002
Will it?

19:36.036 --> 19:37.003
What?

19:37.037 --> 19:38.763
You know very well what.

19:38.798 --> 19:41.007
If you'd left well alone, none
of this would have happened.

19:41.041 --> 19:42.457
How is it my fault that he--

19:42.491 --> 19:44.666
All he wants to do
is make you proud,

19:44.700 --> 19:45.977
but you set these
standards for him

19:46.012 --> 19:48.083
that are impossible to meet.

19:48.117 --> 19:50.292
If you just left him
to it once in a while,

19:50.327 --> 19:52.950
maybe he'd surprise you.

19:52.984 --> 19:56.988
We're not talking about
Tricki Woo any more, are we?

19:57.023 --> 19:59.750
We're simple folk,
really, Mr. Farnon.

19:59.784 --> 20:03.063
We all just want the
occasional pat on the head.

20:03.098 --> 20:04.789
Isn't that right, Tricki?

20:05.928 --> 20:07.309
Hm?

20:07.344 --> 20:08.724
Hm?

20:11.106 --> 20:13.419
Thanks for helping us with
all of this, Mr. Herriot.

20:13.453 --> 20:15.041
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Herriot.

20:15.075 --> 20:16.042
Not at all.

20:16.076 --> 20:17.940
You did all the hard work.

20:17.975 --> 20:19.252
I had the easy job.

20:19.287 --> 20:20.253
[Boy] Mr. Herriot!

20:20.288 --> 20:21.392
Mrs. Dalby!

20:21.427 --> 20:24.084
[somber music]

20:32.092 --> 20:33.887
Hey, Billy,

20:33.922 --> 20:36.959
why don't you give me a hand
to fetch them some more hay?

20:42.517 --> 20:43.725
I'm so sorry.

20:47.142 --> 20:48.937
I'm not a farmer.

20:48.971 --> 20:50.663
Billy was the farmer.

20:50.697 --> 20:52.147
He knew everything
there was to know

20:52.181 --> 20:53.942
and he was so proud the
life we'd built here

20:53.976 --> 20:55.737
and I'm letting him down.

20:55.771 --> 20:58.636
Phyllis, you're not
letting anyone down.

20:58.671 --> 20:59.775
I know it can feel
like that sometimes,

20:59.810 --> 21:02.847
but you're doing
the best you can.

21:03.745 --> 21:05.954
But what if my best
isn't good enough?

21:06.989 --> 21:11.131
What you're trying
to do here is hard.

21:11.166 --> 21:12.857
Anyone would doubt themselves.

21:15.170 --> 21:18.725
Mum, are we going
to be all right?

21:18.760 --> 21:20.279
Come here, love.

21:25.042 --> 21:26.630
Of course we are.

21:30.565 --> 21:33.361
-[lighter flicking]
-Here we go, James.

21:33.395 --> 21:35.501
All fresh and aired.

21:35.535 --> 21:36.743
Thanks, Mrs. H.

21:39.988 --> 21:42.128
Oh, very handsome.

21:42.162 --> 21:44.475
It'll be a miracle if they
make it through the night.

21:44.510 --> 21:46.891
Having been proved
wrong more than once,

21:46.926 --> 21:48.893
I've learned never
to underestimate

21:48.928 --> 21:50.999
the resilience of nature.

21:51.033 --> 21:52.690
The farmers down at the Drovers

21:52.725 --> 21:55.831
seem to think they just can't
run the place on their own.

21:55.866 --> 21:57.799
What else is she going to do?

21:57.833 --> 21:59.939
Well, she could sell it while
it's still worth something.

21:59.973 --> 22:03.080
Sell the farm and
do what, exactly?

22:03.114 --> 22:05.807
Phyllis and Billy put everything
they had into that farm.

22:05.841 --> 22:07.636
She's not going
to abandon it now,

22:07.671 --> 22:10.467
not root those kids from the
only home they've ever known.

22:10.501 --> 22:12.848
Phyllis knows what's
best for her family,

22:12.883 --> 22:14.816
despite of what
others might think.

22:17.197 --> 22:18.785
Thanks, well I best be off.

22:18.820 --> 22:20.891
-Cheerio.
-Good luck.

22:20.925 --> 22:22.410
Oh,

22:22.444 --> 22:23.721
wait a sec.

22:25.516 --> 22:27.104
I've posted your letter for you.

22:27.138 --> 22:28.657
Thanks.

22:28.692 --> 22:30.141
I know it's hard, but you've
done what you can today

22:30.176 --> 22:31.764
for Phyllis and your mother.

22:32.696 --> 22:35.871
Now go have a wonderful
time with Helen.

22:35.906 --> 22:37.114
It's important.

22:37.148 --> 22:39.910
[upbeat music]

22:46.295 --> 22:47.331
[light music]

22:47.366 --> 22:48.401
Mr. Ingledew.

22:48.436 --> 22:49.644
Good evening.

22:49.678 --> 22:51.162
I presume this is yours.

22:51.197 --> 22:52.750
I saw them arrive yesterday.

22:54.062 --> 22:55.097
Tristan?

22:56.444 --> 22:57.686
Tristan!

23:03.865 --> 23:05.073
Thanks, James.

23:05.107 --> 23:08.076
[whimsical music]

23:16.567 --> 23:19.881
Come on, Annabel,
let's get you home.

23:22.539 --> 23:24.748
God, that was close.

23:32.238 --> 23:33.204
Damn it.

-[somber music]

24:14.314 --> 24:16.282
Oh, dear.

24:16.316 --> 24:18.836
You'd better come in, James.

24:27.120 --> 24:28.536
Oh dear, indeed.

24:28.570 --> 24:30.469
The car ran into a bit of
a ditch on the way over.

24:30.503 --> 24:32.298
Perhaps you can borrow a
pair of my dad's shoes.

24:32.332 --> 24:34.749
-Oh no, that's quite all right.
-You can't go out like that.

24:34.783 --> 24:37.165
Dad, lend James some
shoes and socks, will you?

24:37.199 --> 24:39.443
-There's really no need--
-Nonsense.

24:39.478 --> 24:40.789
Dad don't mind.

24:46.208 --> 24:48.383
Here. You can wipe your
trousers down with this.

24:48.417 --> 24:49.833
Thanks.

24:54.251 --> 24:56.149
There you go.

24:56.184 --> 24:57.565
Me old dancing shoes.

24:58.945 --> 25:01.154
Been a while since
they've had an outing.

25:02.259 --> 25:04.675
Oh, honestly, I'll be fine.

25:04.710 --> 25:06.746
Are they not to
your liking, James?

25:07.989 --> 25:09.093
No, no.

25:09.128 --> 25:10.474
No, these are,

25:11.199 --> 25:12.407
they're perfect.

25:13.960 --> 25:15.237
Thank you, Mr. Alderson.

25:15.272 --> 25:16.515
Aye.

25:17.170 --> 25:18.827
I'll go see what Helen's up to.

25:24.212 --> 25:25.558
James is here.

25:25.593 --> 25:26.663
Can you make sure Dad
checks the tarpaulin

25:26.697 --> 25:28.112
on the barn roof, and make sure?

25:28.147 --> 25:30.045
Stop worrying.

25:30.080 --> 25:31.426
Go enjoy yourself.

25:31.460 --> 25:33.428
Me and Dad will be
just fine without you.

25:42.161 --> 25:43.576
Sorry, James.

25:43.611 --> 25:47.028
[soft music]

25:47.062 --> 25:49.893
I thought we could go to
The Renniston for dinner.

25:49.927 --> 25:51.757
The Renniston?

25:51.791 --> 25:52.896
Fancy.

25:52.930 --> 25:53.931
I should go and
get changed, then.

25:53.966 --> 25:55.174
No, you look...

25:56.796 --> 25:58.004
perfect.

26:01.525 --> 26:02.940
Go on, then.

26:02.975 --> 26:06.116
Don't want to be late
for The Renniston.

26:06.150 --> 26:08.118
I won't be late.

26:08.152 --> 26:10.085
Enjoy yourself, love.

26:23.340 --> 26:25.342
[whimsical music]

26:25.376 --> 26:27.724
[both laughing]

26:27.758 --> 26:29.001
Goodbye.

26:30.209 --> 26:32.936
[sheep bleating]

26:32.970 --> 26:34.627
If you prefer to
go to the Drovers,

26:34.662 --> 26:36.180
I'd be fine with that.

26:36.215 --> 26:37.596
You don't want to go?

26:37.630 --> 26:39.114
Oh no, of course,
it's a lovely idea.

26:39.149 --> 26:40.150
I just meant,

26:40.840 --> 26:42.359
well, if you didn't wanna go.

26:42.393 --> 26:44.050
No, of course I want to go.

26:46.225 --> 26:48.020
-Great.
-Great.

26:48.054 --> 26:50.539
[soft music]

26:53.542 --> 26:55.890
[Siegfried whistling]

26:55.924 --> 26:57.167
[bell dinging]

26:57.201 --> 26:58.582
I'll get it!

27:03.622 --> 27:07.108
[chickens clucking]

27:07.142 --> 27:08.178
Tristan!

27:09.558 --> 27:11.181
I give you this
simple, little job,

27:11.215 --> 27:13.459
one would have thought
even you would be hard put

27:13.493 --> 27:15.910
to make a mess of it, and
look at the situation.

27:15.944 --> 27:19.085
Not one solitary
egg have we seen,

27:19.120 --> 27:20.984
the bloody hens are flying
about the place like pigeons

27:21.018 --> 27:23.987
and we are now permanently
estranged from our neighbors.

27:24.021 --> 27:26.127
I'm sorry, Siegfried.

27:26.161 --> 27:27.404
I'm sure I put the latch down.

27:27.438 --> 27:28.577
I always double-check.

27:28.612 --> 27:29.958
I don't [stammering],

27:31.028 --> 27:33.168
[Tricki growling]

27:33.203 --> 27:34.583
want to hear it.

27:34.618 --> 27:38.208
Just try not to burn the
house down while I'm out.

27:38.242 --> 27:39.796
Who's up for games night?

27:39.830 --> 27:41.970
Sorry, Mrs. Hall, I'm
out with Diana tonight.

27:42.005 --> 27:45.180
In fact, I'm running
late as it is.

27:47.148 --> 27:50.496
I've got to see a
man about a chicken.

27:51.635 --> 27:52.878
Sorry, Mrs. H.

28:01.783 --> 28:02.991
Right.

28:04.993 --> 28:06.685
Just me then, is it?

28:07.720 --> 28:10.516
[bright music]

28:49.037 --> 28:52.006
Miss Alderson, how
lovely to see you again.

28:52.040 --> 28:54.180
Hello.

28:54.215 --> 28:55.941
Would you care for a table, sir?

28:55.975 --> 28:57.425
Yes, please.

28:58.460 --> 29:00.048
Table for two.

29:00.083 --> 29:01.498
Are you staying, sir?

29:03.224 --> 29:04.535
Yes, of course I'm staying.

29:06.296 --> 29:07.538
This way, please.

29:13.924 --> 29:15.443
Thank you.

29:15.477 --> 29:16.685
Thank you.

29:20.517 --> 29:23.106
May I have your
room number, sir?

29:23.140 --> 29:24.176
Room number?

29:25.694 --> 29:28.076
Oh, I'm not living in the hotel.

29:28.111 --> 29:30.251
Oh, not staying then.

29:33.012 --> 29:34.151
Ignore him.

29:35.290 --> 29:38.155
[easygoing music]

29:52.756 --> 29:55.241
How's Phyllis getting on?

29:55.276 --> 29:57.796
She lost one of her stirks
when I was there today.

29:57.830 --> 29:59.832
Oh, James, I'm so sorry.

29:59.867 --> 30:01.800
That must have been
difficult for you both.

30:01.834 --> 30:03.663
I just wish I'd
seen them sooner.

30:03.698 --> 30:05.769
She might have had a
fighting chance a week ago.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.288
Well, you're there now,

30:07.322 --> 30:10.187
and if anyone can pull
it off, it's Phyllis.

30:10.222 --> 30:12.603
I just worry it's
too little, too late.

30:12.638 --> 30:14.605
It's not like you to
give up so easily.

30:14.640 --> 30:15.986
You didn't see her today.

30:18.195 --> 30:21.405
She's already having to use
her winter supply of hay

30:21.440 --> 30:24.339
and spending money that she
doesn't have on expensive cake.

30:24.374 --> 30:27.687
I just want to give her
any more false hope.

30:27.722 --> 30:30.587
I'm sorry, I shouldn't be
burdening you with all of this.

30:30.621 --> 30:32.416
You're not burdening me.

30:32.451 --> 30:33.832
It's nice that you care.

30:34.798 --> 30:37.525
Farming's a tough life.

30:37.559 --> 30:40.045
So much loss and hardship.

30:40.079 --> 30:41.460
It's bloody hard work.

30:42.737 --> 30:44.635
Do you ever think
you could leave?

30:44.670 --> 30:45.844
Do something different?

30:45.878 --> 30:46.845
Me?

30:46.879 --> 30:48.847
I think about it all the time.

30:48.881 --> 30:50.607
I think what it might be like

30:50.641 --> 30:53.334
to not have dirt under
my fingernails every day,

30:53.368 --> 30:56.924
not have to worry about
money, or shovel muck.

30:59.719 --> 31:01.135
Thank you.

31:04.932 --> 31:05.967
Thank you.

31:09.868 --> 31:14.734
I've been thinking about
Phyllis and farming

31:14.769 --> 31:17.910
and what you were
saying just now, and.

31:17.945 --> 31:19.912
And what, James?

31:19.947 --> 31:23.364
Well, perhaps it doesn't
have to be a struggle

31:23.398 --> 31:24.986
for Phyllis.

31:25.021 --> 31:27.747
All the other farmers think
she should sell the farm,

31:27.782 --> 31:29.266
and maybe they're right.

31:29.301 --> 31:30.681
Maybe it's not too late.

31:30.716 --> 31:32.614
She could sell up, move away,

31:32.649 --> 31:34.340
make a fresh start
somewhere new.

31:34.375 --> 31:37.343
All the memories of Billy
are tied up in that farm.

31:37.378 --> 31:39.138
All the boy's memories.

31:39.173 --> 31:40.381
That would mean
her leaving behind

31:40.415 --> 31:42.210
everything she's ever known.

31:42.245 --> 31:43.349
It's what I had to do.

31:43.384 --> 31:44.385
That's different.

31:44.419 --> 31:46.905
You made a choice to come here.

31:46.939 --> 31:48.872
It doesn't mean it was easy.

31:48.907 --> 31:52.911
My life was in Glasgow,
my friends, my family.

31:54.498 --> 31:55.706
It's not the same.

31:56.984 --> 31:58.019
Why not?

31:59.158 --> 32:01.298
Because I'm not a farmer?

32:02.782 --> 32:05.751
Because your life isn't
the ground under your feet.

32:05.785 --> 32:06.994
You haven't poured blood, sweat,

32:07.028 --> 32:08.478
and tears into
the soil you plow.

32:08.512 --> 32:09.824
[soft music]

32:09.858 --> 32:11.343
You haven't raised
animals from birth

32:11.377 --> 32:13.690
knowing they could be
taken from your any moment,

32:13.724 --> 32:15.554
and with them, your livelihood.

32:15.588 --> 32:18.281
I feel like you're making
my argument for me.

32:18.315 --> 32:21.215
Billy Dalby took on that
farm from his father,

32:21.249 --> 32:23.389
and his father before him.

32:23.424 --> 32:24.873
It's young Billy's birthright.

32:24.908 --> 32:27.497
So long as there's
something left to inherit.

32:34.987 --> 32:37.507
So you can see yourself
ever leaving, then?

32:39.302 --> 32:41.683
Well, I'm not going to
live with my dad forever,

32:41.718 --> 32:43.616
but I could never
be too far away.

32:45.998 --> 32:48.069
I can't expect you
to understand that.

32:51.555 --> 32:52.832
No.

32:53.557 --> 32:55.594
You're probably right.

33:02.635 --> 33:05.569
[upbeat music]

33:05.604 --> 33:08.227
[door closing]

33:13.508 --> 33:15.096
Is there a spare
one of those going?

33:16.063 --> 33:17.719
Coming right up.

33:17.754 --> 33:19.273
Its not the good
stuff I'm afraid,

33:19.307 --> 33:20.895
Siegfried would kill me.

33:20.929 --> 33:24.278
As long as it's strong
and large, I don't care.

33:32.424 --> 33:34.633
Want to talk about it?

33:36.428 --> 33:37.670
Not really.

33:39.638 --> 33:40.846
What have you been up to?

33:40.880 --> 33:42.882
Oh, the usual,
disappointing Siegfried,

33:42.917 --> 33:45.609
annoying the neighbors,
creating avian anarchy.

33:46.783 --> 33:48.233
Siegfried still
on your case then?

33:48.267 --> 33:50.821
I think it's his life's
work to be on my case.

33:50.856 --> 33:53.652
His magnum opus will be
the utter destruction

33:53.686 --> 33:55.861
and destitution of
his little brother.

33:55.895 --> 33:58.553
Did you try standing up
to him, like I suggested?

33:58.588 --> 33:59.865
I did, yes.

33:59.899 --> 34:01.763
Now it's made everything worse.

34:01.798 --> 34:03.006
But I've got a plan.

34:05.353 --> 34:07.597
[light music]

34:07.631 --> 34:10.531
What are you going to do,
just keep laying eggs?

34:12.291 --> 34:13.637
I don't know.

34:13.672 --> 34:16.019
It may seem like
the easy option,

34:16.054 --> 34:17.814
but won't it feel like
a shallow victory?

34:17.848 --> 34:19.988
A victory is a
victory, nonetheless.

34:25.132 --> 34:29.032
-[birds chirping]
-[light music]

34:29.067 --> 34:31.138
-[chickens clucking]
-Hello.

34:36.143 --> 34:37.247
Look at that!

34:40.630 --> 34:44.565
[chuckling] He's only
gone and bloody done it.

34:48.776 --> 34:50.191
[bread crunching]

34:50.226 --> 34:53.263
Oh, the taste of a fresh egg,
can't beat it.

34:56.301 --> 34:58.786
Are you heading up
to the Dalby's today?

34:58.820 --> 35:00.891
Unfortunately, yes.

35:00.926 --> 35:03.273
I have no idea what to
say to the poor woman.

35:03.308 --> 35:04.895
I could see the look
of hope on her face

35:04.930 --> 35:07.312
when I gave the stirks
the throat injection.

35:09.176 --> 35:10.349
I don't know.

35:10.384 --> 35:12.834
I just don't feel
like I'm being honest.

35:12.869 --> 35:14.871
Honesty is the best policy.

35:16.424 --> 35:19.462
Of course, the throat injection
was never going to work.

35:19.496 --> 35:21.084
What?

35:21.119 --> 35:22.810
But you were the one that
told me to give it to them.

35:22.844 --> 35:25.640
This isn't about the injection.

35:25.675 --> 35:28.160
Look, it's the worst
part of the job,

35:28.195 --> 35:31.646
when you realize everything
is in the lap of the gods.

35:31.681 --> 35:33.200
But at least now you can
look Phyllis in the eye

35:33.234 --> 35:36.789
and tell her you have tried
absolutely everything.

35:36.824 --> 35:39.033
And as long as you've
tried everything,

35:39.067 --> 35:40.724
then you've done your job.

35:42.933 --> 35:45.350
You'll find the right thing
to say, I have no doubt.

35:48.836 --> 35:50.044
Thanks, Siegfried.

35:55.843 --> 35:59.709
I know that I can set these
high standards at times,

35:59.743 --> 36:04.196
and perhaps come across
as slightly overbearing.

36:04.231 --> 36:05.301
Slightly.

36:07.234 --> 36:09.926
It's only because I want
the best for you both.

36:09.960 --> 36:10.996
And,

36:12.446 --> 36:16.001
Tristan, maybe I should
trust you a bit more.

36:16.035 --> 36:20.764
And recognize your successes
when you have them.

36:26.253 --> 36:27.909
It's a week's wage.

36:27.944 --> 36:30.671
Well done.
You were right about the hens

36:30.705 --> 36:33.605
and you've more than
proved yourself of late.

36:36.918 --> 36:38.575
Thanks, Siegfried.

36:38.610 --> 36:40.094
You've earned it.

36:53.452 --> 36:55.937
Actually, I've got a
confession to make.

36:58.181 --> 37:00.114
I think I'd better get going.

37:00.770 --> 37:02.081
Confession?

37:05.499 --> 37:08.950
It's just, I wanted so
desperately to make you proud

37:08.985 --> 37:11.159
and do something right
for a change and,

37:14.991 --> 37:16.130
I lied.

37:17.545 --> 37:19.029
I bought the eggs
from the grocers

37:19.064 --> 37:21.204
and planted them in the
nest box last night.

37:23.033 --> 37:24.069
Here.

37:29.316 --> 37:30.317
Right.

37:30.351 --> 37:32.457
[Tricky panting]

37:32.491 --> 37:35.149
[soft music]

37:38.152 --> 37:40.948
[Tricki whining]

37:43.157 --> 37:44.192
Take it.

37:44.986 --> 37:46.988
We all make mistakes.

37:47.023 --> 37:50.682
The thing is to forgive
and learn from them.

37:54.617 --> 37:56.722
What mistakes?

37:56.757 --> 38:00.692
Well, it might have been me
that left the barn door open.

38:00.726 --> 38:03.246
In my defense, Tricky had
just been attacked and,

38:05.283 --> 38:07.112
I suppose that makes
us even, doesn't it?

38:07.146 --> 38:07.940
Does it?

38:07.975 --> 38:09.597
I'd take it if I were you.

38:10.529 --> 38:12.773
[bell dinging]

38:12.807 --> 38:14.188
I'll get it.

38:20.401 --> 38:21.609
Thanks, Siegfried.

38:28.789 --> 38:30.100
Mr. Ingledew.

38:30.135 --> 38:31.826
Found these in our
vegetable patch.

38:31.861 --> 38:33.138
I'm guessing they belong to you,

38:33.172 --> 38:35.209
seeing as I don't keep any hens.

38:37.004 --> 38:38.730
What are you thinking?

38:38.764 --> 38:40.179
Right, thank you.

38:40.214 --> 38:44.114
-And I do apologize for--
-[door closing]

38:44.149 --> 38:45.461
What do you know?

38:45.495 --> 38:47.428
They did figure it out
for themselves, after all.

38:47.463 --> 38:49.257
[soft music]

38:49.292 --> 38:50.949
Perhaps what we've
learned from this

38:50.983 --> 38:55.056
is that the hens might be better
placed with the Ingledews.

38:55.091 --> 38:57.369
I suppose we all end
up where we belong,

38:58.439 --> 38:59.751
eventually.

39:04.134 --> 39:09.347
-[birds chirping]
-[door closing]

39:16.112 --> 39:17.424
I see you've lost another one.

39:17.458 --> 39:18.942
We have.

39:18.977 --> 39:21.013
But Mrs. Dalby's sure she
noticed an improvement

39:21.048 --> 39:22.601
in the others' appetite.

39:22.636 --> 39:24.914
That must be a good sign.

39:24.948 --> 39:26.950
Let's go have a look
at them, shall we?

39:38.997 --> 39:40.895
How are they
looking, Mr. Herriot?

39:40.930 --> 39:43.001
I wish I had some better news,

39:43.035 --> 39:45.175
but they're still very sick.

39:45.210 --> 39:47.488
Now, I know you've told me
not to turn the young beasts

39:47.523 --> 39:48.627
out onto the field any more,

39:48.662 --> 39:52.390
but isn't there a way around it?

39:52.424 --> 39:54.495
Perhaps it could help to
get them back outside.

39:54.530 --> 39:57.843
No, I'm sorry.
Until there's a vaccine,

39:57.878 --> 40:01.226
there's no way of safeguarding
them against husk.

40:01.260 --> 40:03.918
Then we will just have
to find another solution.

40:07.784 --> 40:09.372
Mrs. Dalby,

40:09.407 --> 40:12.237
this is what I've been
meaning to talk to you about.

40:14.791 --> 40:17.725
I've been giving the matter
a great deal of thought and,

40:17.760 --> 40:20.659
well, you've lost
so much already,

40:22.420 --> 40:23.731
I just couldn't live with myself

40:23.766 --> 40:25.699
if I didn't give you
my honest opinion.

40:29.150 --> 40:30.186
I see.

40:32.775 --> 40:34.190
I'm so sorry.

40:34.224 --> 40:37.055
I really am, but we've
tried everything now,

40:37.089 --> 40:38.712
and there's still
a very real chance

40:38.746 --> 40:40.955
you could end up
losing the entire herd.

40:42.440 --> 40:45.063
So there's a chance
that we might not then?

40:45.753 --> 40:47.721
A slim one, yes.

40:54.762 --> 40:57.282
I've given you so much
false hope already.

41:01.320 --> 41:04.876
I really think that now
your best course of action

41:04.910 --> 41:08.293
is to sell the farm
before it's too late.

41:08.327 --> 41:11.434
[somber music]

41:11.469 --> 41:14.161
There's nothing false
about hope, Mr. Herriot.

41:14.195 --> 41:15.127
Yes, but--

41:15.162 --> 41:17.129
I appreciate your honesty, I do.

41:19.407 --> 41:22.341
But I've been giving it a
great deal of thought too,

41:22.376 --> 41:24.896
and I understand
the risk involved.

41:25.966 --> 41:28.071
But, when I look around

41:30.315 --> 41:33.352
I don't just see the things
I've lost or might lose,

41:35.631 --> 41:40.256
I see everything I have.

41:40.290 --> 41:42.016
I see my boys.

41:43.501 --> 41:46.089
How I have so much worth
fighting for still.

41:48.057 --> 41:50.922
And I owe it to them, to
my family, not to give up.

41:50.956 --> 41:53.752
Even if it is the slimmest
of chances, I'll take it.

41:58.550 --> 42:01.898
I might not have been able to
save my husband, Mr. Herriot,

42:01.933 --> 42:03.210
but I can save our farm.

42:05.384 --> 42:06.696
Our home.

42:09.319 --> 42:10.424
So we're staying put.

42:13.945 --> 42:17.051
Like my Billy
always used to say,

42:17.086 --> 42:19.433
only them as has them
can lose them. [laughing]

42:22.229 --> 42:23.575
Now, come on,

42:23.610 --> 42:24.680
you must have one
of these scones,

42:24.714 --> 42:26.164
they're fresh from the oven.

42:32.170 --> 42:35.207
[birds chirping]

42:36.277 --> 42:37.520
Okay, Billy?

42:37.555 --> 42:39.384
No time for getting
it on, Mr. Herriot.

42:39.418 --> 42:43.561
I'm man of the house now, got
some stirks that need savin'.

42:43.595 --> 42:45.666
Of course.

42:45.701 --> 42:48.324
-See you, Billy.
-Bye, Mr. Herriot.

42:58.783 --> 43:01.958
[crowd applauding]

43:01.993 --> 43:05.272
[radio chattering]

43:06.169 --> 43:08.862
[crowd cheering]

43:08.896 --> 43:10.208
He's done it!

43:10.242 --> 43:12.141
[all cheering]

43:12.175 --> 43:14.937
[all applauding]

43:15.869 --> 43:17.802
Well done.

43:19.804 --> 43:21.357
Our boy.

43:22.910 --> 43:24.187
-Lad.
-Brilliant.

43:24.222 --> 43:25.257
Brilliant.

43:26.189 --> 43:27.225
Wonderful.

43:29.607 --> 43:31.678
[bell dinging]

43:31.712 --> 43:34.542
[Tricki barking]

43:39.962 --> 43:41.204
I'll get it.

43:41.239 --> 43:43.759
[light music]

43:44.518 --> 43:46.313
Tricky, Mummy's here.

43:48.591 --> 43:51.249
Darling, dearest boy,

43:51.283 --> 43:52.802
how have you been?

43:54.114 --> 43:56.185
Mrs. Pumphrey, do come in.

43:56.219 --> 43:57.255
Thank you.

43:58.083 --> 43:59.947
Forgive my early arrival.

43:59.982 --> 44:02.467
Our separation became
far too unbearable.

44:02.501 --> 44:04.918
-Quite all right.
-I'll fetch some tea.

44:05.712 --> 44:06.920
Do sit down, Mrs. Pumphrey.

44:06.954 --> 44:09.060
-Allow me.
-Thank you.

44:10.302 --> 44:14.962
I so appreciate his
Uncle Herriot looking

44:14.997 --> 44:16.688
Where is our dear James?

44:16.723 --> 44:18.794
Out on a call, I'm afraid.

44:18.828 --> 44:20.968
Oh, what a pity.

44:21.003 --> 44:22.970
How was your trip?

44:23.005 --> 44:26.629
Hutton and Leyland
made quite the pair.

44:26.664 --> 44:30.909
I almost dropped my binoculars
in all the excitement.

44:30.944 --> 44:33.256
We just heard, Hutton
beat Bradman's record.

44:33.291 --> 44:35.327
Terrific!

44:35.362 --> 44:36.984
Of course, Tricki
suffers most dreadfully

44:37.019 --> 44:38.537
from travel sickness,

44:38.572 --> 44:40.367
so we're forced to be
apart for the duration.

44:40.401 --> 44:43.266
It was the whiff of manure
wafting from the pitch

44:43.301 --> 44:46.684
that made me yearn for
home and my beloved boy.

44:46.718 --> 44:48.168
Which reminds me,

44:48.202 --> 44:50.101
I do hope you are
practicing your inswinger,

44:50.135 --> 44:52.310
ready for my little
cricket match this summer.

44:52.344 --> 44:55.175
Of course, wouldn't miss it
for the world, Mrs. Pumphrey.

44:55.209 --> 44:56.659
Wonderful.

44:56.694 --> 44:59.800
Oh, look Tricky, your favorite.

44:59.835 --> 45:02.561
He does love a homemade biscuit.

45:02.596 --> 45:04.460
They're actually for
you, Mrs. Pumphrey.

45:04.494 --> 45:06.117
Oh, I only eat a Fortnum myself.

45:06.151 --> 45:08.844
But Tricky is a
little less fussy.

45:08.878 --> 45:10.190
And how was my darling boy been?

45:10.224 --> 45:12.226
I do hope he has
behaved himself.

45:13.538 --> 45:14.884
Well.

45:17.300 --> 45:18.716
Honesty.

45:18.750 --> 45:20.959
Yes, um,

45:20.994 --> 45:23.962
truth be told, there
was a slight incident.

45:23.997 --> 45:27.207
I took temporary
charge of Tricky

45:27.241 --> 45:32.695
while James, While Uncle
Herriot, was on a call,

45:32.730 --> 45:34.352
turned my back for a second,

45:34.386 --> 45:40.013
and Tricky did receive a tiny
peck from one of our hens.

45:40.047 --> 45:41.600
[Tricki growling]

45:41.635 --> 45:45.604
I take full responsibility,
I'm terribly sorry.

45:45.639 --> 45:48.124
Oh, Tricky always goes
completely cracker-dog

45:48.159 --> 45:49.988
when there's a chicken in sight.

45:50.023 --> 45:52.853
Tricky woo-lally I call it.

45:52.888 --> 45:54.441
I couldn't tell you what
he has against them,

45:54.475 --> 45:57.547
but that'll be the fifth
peck he has had this year.

45:58.583 --> 46:00.274
Oh, right.

46:00.309 --> 46:04.037
Perhaps it's because
he's an only dog.

46:04.071 --> 46:08.317
I do think that an only
develops more prejudices

46:08.351 --> 46:10.319
than one from a large family.

46:11.113 --> 46:12.286
Wouldn't you agree?

46:12.321 --> 46:14.944
[bright music]

46:16.877 --> 46:18.776
Try not to be upset.

46:20.260 --> 46:24.091
You will see your
uncles again very soon.

46:24.126 --> 46:26.128
And the pain of
parting is nothing

46:26.162 --> 46:28.786
to the joy of meeting again.

46:30.788 --> 46:32.859
Thank you.

46:32.893 --> 46:35.413
Good day, Mrs. Pumphrey.

46:35.447 --> 46:36.932
Goodbye, Tricky.

46:36.966 --> 46:39.451
-[Tricky barking]
-Oh, of course, Tricky, yes,

46:39.486 --> 46:40.832
where are my manners?

46:40.867 --> 46:42.351
Francois, would you mind?

46:44.249 --> 46:48.012
You reminded me.

46:48.046 --> 46:49.565
To say thank you.

46:49.599 --> 46:50.946
Oh.

46:52.223 --> 46:53.949
To his Uncle Herriot.

46:55.640 --> 46:57.987
The kippers, exquisite.

46:59.057 --> 47:02.267
Right, home, please, Francois.

47:02.302 --> 47:07.514
-Toodle-oo.
-[engine starting]

47:51.938 --> 47:53.422
Phyllis lost another stirk.

47:55.148 --> 47:57.875
A few more are on their way out.

47:57.909 --> 48:00.394
But she is determined
to keep going,

48:00.429 --> 48:02.362
even if it's only
with half a herd.

48:03.777 --> 48:04.882
You were right.

48:04.916 --> 48:07.436
I get it now, and
I'm sorry about.

48:22.209 --> 48:25.109
This was my mum's favorite
spot, up here on this roof.

48:26.317 --> 48:29.251
Used to come up here
at lunchtime and

48:29.285 --> 48:30.769
[soft music]

48:30.804 --> 48:34.083
She'd point out different
parts of the farm and tell me,

48:34.118 --> 48:35.740
that's where you
scraped your knee

48:35.774 --> 48:37.293
trying to jump over the bales.

48:39.399 --> 48:44.473
That's where you helped out
with your first lambing.

48:46.889 --> 48:48.580
And that spot there,

48:51.169 --> 48:53.931
that's where I told your dad
I were pregnant with you.

48:55.173 --> 48:57.589
And his grin filled his
whole face. [laughing]

49:54.992 --> 49:57.615
[bright music]
