00:14.014 --> 00:15.265
[grunts]

00:19.394 --> 00:20.729
[yells]

00:27.778 --> 00:29.446
-Ahhh!
-[grunts]

00:31.198 --> 00:33.241
[yells]

00:35.452 --> 00:36.579
[groans]

00:55.263 --> 00:57.349
[yells]

01:07.025 --> 01:08.318
[grunts]

01:14.617 --> 01:15.618
Ahh!

01:25.878 --> 01:26.879
Ahhh!

01:29.798 --> 01:32.092
[yells]

01:42.645 --> 01:44.647
[theme music playing]

02:54.216 --> 02:57.219
Started to wonder
if you'd ever turn up again.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.598
Yeah, I've, uh...

03:01.681 --> 03:03.100
-been busy.
-Hmm.

03:04.267 --> 03:07.604
Well, I'll be inside,
you wanna take confession.

03:11.483 --> 03:12.609
Uh, Father?

03:18.991 --> 03:21.744
I was wondering
if I could take you up on that latte?

03:47.895 --> 03:49.187
Sugar?

03:50.188 --> 03:51.231
No.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.109
[sighs]

03:57.195 --> 03:58.321
So...

04:01.408 --> 04:03.618
what's on your mind, Matthew?

04:06.163 --> 04:08.373
Wasn't that hard to find out.

04:09.624 --> 04:14.296
People still remember "Battlin' Jack"
Murdock around these parts...

04:14.379 --> 04:16.589
and what happened to his son.

04:19.342 --> 04:23.180
Seal of confession still applies,
even over lattes.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.015
That what you're worried about.

04:27.851 --> 04:30.228
Do you believe in the Devil, Father?

04:32.773 --> 04:35.859
You mean... as a concept?

04:35.943 --> 04:36.944
No.

04:38.736 --> 04:40.738
Do you believe he exists?

04:42.240 --> 04:44.576
In this world, among us.

04:45.493 --> 04:47.788
You want the short answer
or the long one?

04:48.914 --> 04:50.457
Just the truth.

04:55.753 --> 04:57.672
When I was in seminary...

04:58.799 --> 05:01.885
I was more studious than pious, more...

05:01.969 --> 05:05.848
skeptical than most of my peers.

05:05.931 --> 05:07.933
I had this notion...

05:08.016 --> 05:11.186
which I was more than willing
to speak about, at length,

05:11.269 --> 05:13.771
to whoever I could corner...

05:13.856 --> 05:16.191
that the Devil...

05:16.274 --> 05:17.609
was inconsequential.

05:18.651 --> 05:21.029
Minor figure in the grand scheme.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.074
Not very Catholic of you.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.575
Uh-huh, yeah.

05:25.658 --> 05:31.748
In my defense, in the scriptures,
the Hebrew word "Satan"

05:31.832 --> 05:33.666
actually means "adversary."

05:33.750 --> 05:37.295
It's applied to any antagonist.

05:37.379 --> 05:41.091
Angels and humans,
serpents and kings.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.843
Medieval theologians
reinterpreted those passages

05:43.927 --> 05:47.430
to be about a single monstrous enemy.

05:48.765 --> 05:53.061
And, in my youthful zeal,
I was certain I knew why...

05:53.145 --> 05:54.271
propaganda.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.650
Played up to drive people
into the church.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.152
So you don't believe he exists.

06:00.235 --> 06:01.945
Am I done talking?

06:03.613 --> 06:05.448
Sorry.

06:05.532 --> 06:09.161
Years later, I was in Rwanda...

06:09.244 --> 06:14.082
trying to help local churches
provide aid and sanctuary to refugees.

06:15.708 --> 06:18.628
I'd become close
with the village elder,

06:18.711 --> 06:21.298
Gahiji.

06:21.381 --> 06:26.386
He and his family had the respect
of everybody, Hutu and Tutsi alike.

06:26.469 --> 06:30.933
He'd helped them all...
through famines, disease.

06:33.977 --> 06:38.606
The militia liked to force Hutu villagers
to murder their neighbors...

06:40.858 --> 06:41.944
with machetes.

06:43.153 --> 06:46.614
But nobody would
raise a hand against Gahiji.

06:46.698 --> 06:50.743
They said, "Well...
how can we kill such a holy man?"

06:52.537 --> 06:55.165
So the militia commander sent soldiers...

06:56.583 --> 06:58.001
with orders to cut his head off...

06:59.502 --> 07:01.796
in front of the entire village.

07:03.631 --> 07:05.717
Gahiji didn't try to put up a fight.

07:06.969 --> 07:09.972
Just asked for the chance
to say goodbye to his family.

07:11.264 --> 07:15.435
By the time he was done,
even the soldiers didn't wanna kill him.

07:15.518 --> 07:18.521
So they went to their commander
and asked permission to shoot him.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.399
At least give him a quick death.

07:23.944 --> 07:27.614
The commander wanted to meet this man...

07:29.074 --> 07:31.451
who had won the respect of so many.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.704
He went to Gahiji...

07:35.913 --> 07:40.127
talked with him in his hut...
for many hours.

07:43.838 --> 07:47.842
Then he dragged him out in front
of his village and hacked him to pieces...

07:50.595 --> 07:52.555
along with his entire family.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.896
In that man who took Gahiji's life...

08:01.106 --> 08:02.690
I saw the Devil.

08:04.234 --> 08:07.529
So yes, Matthew...

08:10.323 --> 08:12.450
I believe he walks among us...

08:14.202 --> 08:15.870
taking many forms.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.169
What if you could have stopped him...

08:23.920 --> 08:26.089
from ever hurting anyone again?

08:27.049 --> 08:29.342
Stopped him how?

08:32.470 --> 08:34.806
This doesn't change anything, Ben.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.892
Except now we know
who your king of diamonds is.

08:37.975 --> 08:40.770
You see the news?
Everything's changed.

08:44.649 --> 08:47.652
Fisk has gotten out in front of
being dragged into the spotlight.

08:47.735 --> 08:51.239
My editor thinks he's the Second Coming.
Hell, the whole city does.

08:51.323 --> 08:52.782
[Karen] So, we just--
We keep digging.

08:52.865 --> 08:53.866
[Ben] I've been doing that.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.952
Internet went from nothing on Fisk

08:56.036 --> 09:00.165
to filled with three-hanky stories about
a poor little fat kid from Hell's Kitchen.

09:00.248 --> 09:03.168
Abandoned by his father when he was 12.
Mother died a year later.

09:03.251 --> 09:07.089
Now look at him.
Boot straps and a big dream.

09:07.172 --> 09:08.756
Somebody knows something.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.883
It's just a matter of asking
the right people the right questions

09:10.967 --> 09:11.968
in the right tone of voice.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.971
Yeah, that's how you get yourself hurt.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.016
That's what I keep telling them.

09:19.101 --> 09:20.768
Maybe they'll listen to you.

09:20.852 --> 09:24.439
Ben Urich, Matt Murdock.
Attorney at Why the Hell Bother.

09:26.774 --> 09:29.361
-Mr. Murdock.
-Matt.

09:29.444 --> 09:32.614
My partner thinks we should be
pursuing this through the legal system.

09:32.697 --> 09:33.698
A lot safer that way.

09:33.781 --> 09:35.742
Well, why don't we all just
crawl under the covers, then?

09:35.825 --> 09:36.993
-No, Karen...
-Well, I'm sorry,

09:37.077 --> 09:38.953
but if Fisk is really behind
everything that has happened,

09:39.036 --> 09:40.497
then we need to do something.

09:40.580 --> 09:44.084
If we were the only ones after him,
I'd tend to agree.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.461
Friend of yours
came to see me the other night...

09:46.544 --> 09:47.670
the man in the mask.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.965
[Foggy] Terrorist cop-killer.
[Ben] Says he was framed.

09:51.048 --> 09:53.551
I could say I'm Captain America,
but it doesn't put wings on my head.

09:53.635 --> 09:54.636
[stammers] What did he want?

09:54.719 --> 09:57.347
Same thing we do... expose Fisk.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.434
I printed this from a thumb drive
he gave me.

10:03.728 --> 10:04.771
Oh, my God!

10:04.854 --> 10:08.441
[Ben] Told me Fisk was behind the bombings
and shooting those cops...

10:08.525 --> 10:10.026
said he owns half the police...

10:10.110 --> 10:11.986
that they helped him
take down the Russians.

10:12.069 --> 10:14.489
[Karen] But I don't understand.
If you have all of this, then--

10:14.572 --> 10:19.202
Hearsay. Can't print any of it
without corroboration, can you?

10:19.286 --> 10:22.789
He could just be throwing smoke.
I mean, he just killed Detective Blake.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.833
Said Blake's partner Hoffman did it,
probably on Fisk's orders.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.919
But yeah, it occurred to me.

10:28.836 --> 10:30.255
You could talk to Hoffman.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.132
Tried. He's in the wind.

10:32.215 --> 10:34.426
Or bottom of the river.
Either way...

10:36.093 --> 10:37.762
He just shrugged.

10:37.845 --> 10:38.971
Sorry.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.808
Wait, what about the Union Allied money?

10:41.891 --> 10:44.436
Is there a way that
we can tie it directly to Fisk?

10:44.519 --> 10:45.770
[Ben] Maybe.

10:45.853 --> 10:49.941
According to the Mask, a man named, uh,
Leland Owlsley runs the books.

10:50.024 --> 10:51.734
But since getting roughed up by him,

10:51.818 --> 10:54.237
Owlsley's been surrounded
by Fisk's security.

10:54.321 --> 10:55.363
Can't get anywhere near him.

10:55.447 --> 10:57.574
Same goes with, uh, James Wesley,

10:57.657 --> 11:00.910
the guy you said hired you
to defend Healy.

11:00.993 --> 11:03.371
Look, the Mask came to Ben for help.

11:03.455 --> 11:08.000
And I don't care how rich Fisk is,
nobody can totally erase their past.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.836
I mean, somewhere out there,

11:09.919 --> 11:13.506
there has to be a piece of paper,
a witness...

11:13.590 --> 11:15.717
[sighs] the truth.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.677
[Foggy] What about Confederated Global?

11:17.760 --> 11:19.512
The suit that hired us to defend Healy

11:19.596 --> 11:21.931
standing right next to Fisk
when he gave his big speech.

11:22.014 --> 11:25.142
I looked into that.
According to FCC filings,

11:25.227 --> 11:28.104
Confed Global's where
Fisk gets most of his reported income.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.814
All right, let's play this out.

11:29.897 --> 11:31.858
If Fisk is connected to Confed Global,

11:31.941 --> 11:34.486
that means he's involved in
Westmeyer-Holt Contracting, which--

11:34.569 --> 11:38.406
Westmeyer-Holt is strong-arming tenants
out of their rent-controlled apartments.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.408
Um, they were hired
by a guy named Armand Tully.

11:40.492 --> 11:41.493
The slumlord?

11:41.576 --> 11:45.288
Landman and Zack say he's on vacation
on an island that no one can pronounce,

11:45.372 --> 11:47.123
where they use coconuts as phones.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.876
Another connection in the wind.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.754
Westmeyer-Holt to Confed to Fisk.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.506
We pull that thread, see what it unravels.

11:54.589 --> 11:56.424
Still not sure about this mask guy.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.510
[Karen] He didn't hurt Ben
and he didn't hurt me.

11:58.593 --> 12:01.304
I'll take the Devil of Hell's Kitchen
over Fisk any day.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.515
Plus, he kicks ass.

12:03.598 --> 12:06.643
No, you should've seen the way
that he was flipping around in the rain.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.603
Well, if he's such a badass,
why did he come to Ben?

12:08.686 --> 12:10.522
Why not just take Fisk down himself?

12:11.564 --> 12:15.026
Maybe he knows there's some roads
you can't come back from.

12:21.949 --> 12:25.745
[Wesley] Our latest polls show
your approval numbers rising...

12:25.828 --> 12:28.915
across political, ethnic
and economic lines.

12:28.998 --> 12:33.085
[breathes deeply]
The 501(c)(3) has been approved,

12:33.169 --> 12:35.797
so the PAC is actively making donations,

12:35.880 --> 12:39.634
and Senator Cherryh's office
has asked for a meet.

12:41.218 --> 12:42.304
[Fisk] Breakfast.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.848
Reject the first place they suggest.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.772
How about Detective Hoffman?

12:52.855 --> 12:57.151
Our sources in IAB tell me he was
supposed to give a follow-up statement

12:57.234 --> 12:59.362
about what happened at Metro-General.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.072
He never showed.

13:02.574 --> 13:04.075
We need to put this behind us.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.035
If he's still in the city, we'll find him.

13:06.118 --> 13:07.203
If he isn't?

13:08.245 --> 13:09.288
[laughs]

13:09.372 --> 13:12.208
We'll still find him.
It might just take a little longer.

13:15.002 --> 13:16.838
And the man in the mask?

13:18.005 --> 13:20.842
The authorities are motivated
to shoot on sight...

13:20.925 --> 13:21.968
if they have the opportunity.

13:22.051 --> 13:25.430
He's not nearly as active
as he has been in the past.

13:27.098 --> 13:28.307
Maybe he's given up.

13:28.391 --> 13:32.269
Maybe he's just
choosing his targets more carefully.

13:32.354 --> 13:33.480
[door opening]

13:34.481 --> 13:36.733
Hey, I said you need to wait outside.

13:36.816 --> 13:37.900
[yelling in pain]

13:38.693 --> 13:39.694
[speaking Japanese]

13:42.489 --> 13:43.865
It's all right, Francis.
Thank you.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.908
[Francis groaning]

13:45.992 --> 13:48.202
[Fisk speaking English]
My apologies, Nobu-san.

13:49.537 --> 13:53.040
-If I had known you were coming--
-[Nobu speaking Japanese]

13:56.378 --> 13:59.589
[speaking English] He doesn't care
for the accommodations.

14:00.339 --> 14:03.217
Misspeak my words again...

14:03.300 --> 14:04.677
and I will have your tongue.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.721
[Fisk] Wesley is just trying to be polite.

14:06.804 --> 14:10.475
The time for pleasantries... is at an end.

14:10.558 --> 14:13.728
I was promised a city block

14:13.811 --> 14:17.607
in return for my aid
in your ventures.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.154
There is a...

14:25.448 --> 14:30.161
a tenement in, um...
this particular area...

14:31.538 --> 14:35.375
it has proven troublesome to vacate.

14:36.501 --> 14:38.420
But we have other blocks
coming up if you--

14:38.503 --> 14:40.337
[speaking Japanese]

14:43.883 --> 14:44.884
[speaking English] This one.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.844
I don't recall...

14:48.304 --> 14:50.598
guaranteeing a specific block.

14:52.099 --> 14:55.227
You'll need to be patient...

14:55.311 --> 14:57.354
or choose another.

14:58.815 --> 15:02.985
I am bound by certain requirements.

15:03.069 --> 15:06.406
Even I have those I must answer to.

15:06.489 --> 15:10.952
After the setback at the docks...

15:11.035 --> 15:13.913
I can afford no further disruptions.

15:13.996 --> 15:17.208
Do what you must,
but do it quickly.

15:18.209 --> 15:19.210
Wesley?

15:19.293 --> 15:24.591
Regardless of how carefully it's handled,
you're now the owner of record.

15:24.674 --> 15:28.553
The negative publicity could prove costly.

15:28.636 --> 15:32.098
My organization will compensate you
for the expense.

15:32.181 --> 15:35.893
Well, the offer's appreciated,
but unnecessary.

15:35.977 --> 15:38.605
There is, however, a problem

15:38.688 --> 15:42.692
that you could aid me in solving,
in return for my help.

15:43.901 --> 15:46.446
One that has inconvenienced us both.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.449
The man in black.

15:50.908 --> 15:54.537
He's proven to be more difficult
to address than expected.

15:57.289 --> 16:01.085
Possessed of determination
and unusual talents.

16:05.297 --> 16:08.009
We must match him in kind.

16:08.092 --> 16:13.222
A specialist, perhaps,
from your organization.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.600
I know of one with such skills.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.479
But finding our enemy will be difficult.

16:19.562 --> 16:22.273
He has become... cautious.

16:22.356 --> 16:23.983
Yes, he has.

16:28.530 --> 16:29.906
But emotion...

16:32.158 --> 16:37.622
can turn the most
circumspect of men careless.

16:45.046 --> 16:48.257
[Foggy] No, that's not what I'm saying.
[Karen] Well, it sure sounds like it.

16:48.340 --> 16:51.511
Hey, if Fisk really is the guy
that blew the hell out of my city,

16:51.594 --> 16:53.262
shot those cops and went after you,

16:53.345 --> 16:55.973
then nobody wants to see him
take it on the nuts more than me.

16:56.057 --> 16:57.308
No, I might have you edged out on that.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.894
Okay, present company excluded.

16:59.977 --> 17:03.272
All I'm saying is
Armand Tully is a dead end.

17:03.355 --> 17:04.481
[Matt] You find something out?

17:04.566 --> 17:08.235
I, um, did a little back-channeling
with Marci.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.362
Okay, ew, just--
What did you get?

17:10.446 --> 17:12.198
Tully really is on an island

17:12.281 --> 17:14.784
that he bought with the money
that Confed Global is paying him

17:14.867 --> 17:17.036
for all his real estate holdings
in Hell's Kitchen.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.204
[Karen] Then, that's the link!

17:18.287 --> 17:21.207
I mean, it ties Fisk directly to
what's happening in the tenement case.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.542
No, it doesn't.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.752
According to the records,
the deal just went through this morning.

17:24.836 --> 17:25.920
So...

17:26.003 --> 17:28.590
[Matt] So everything that happened
with the case up till now

17:28.673 --> 17:31.300
was before Fisk was the owner on record.
All falls on Tully.

17:31.383 --> 17:35.304
Okay, so we go after Tully.
We get him to turn on Fisk.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.473
Yeah, that island he's on?

17:37.557 --> 17:39.516
-No extradition agreement.
-[Karen groans]

17:40.184 --> 17:41.811
It's another dead end.

17:42.436 --> 17:43.855
[knock on door]

17:48.025 --> 17:50.987
[conversing in Spanish]

17:51.070 --> 17:52.655
[Elena laughs]

17:55.407 --> 17:56.993
[in English]
You just asked her where the library is.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.494
[conversing in Spanish]

18:04.500 --> 18:06.961
[in English] They doubled
the offer to get the tenants to move out.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.713
[Elena speaking Spanish]

18:10.006 --> 18:11.548
[Karen in English] Oh, damn it.
[Foggy] What?

18:11.633 --> 18:13.593
Her neighbors
are thinking about taking it.

18:13.676 --> 18:14.844
Maybe they should.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.929
[Foggy] No! Tell her to stand firm.

18:17.013 --> 18:19.223
We told her we're gonna help her
and that's what we're gonna do.

18:20.224 --> 18:21.726
[speaking Spanish]

18:27.774 --> 18:29.483
[speaking English]
Such a good boy.

18:30.693 --> 18:32.028
[speaking Spanish]

18:39.911 --> 18:41.746
[in English]
She thinks she can change their minds.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.623
Enough of them maybe to make a difference.

18:43.706 --> 18:47.043
I no take! This my home.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.544
We fight, yes?

18:48.628 --> 18:50.838
Yes, sí.

18:50.922 --> 18:52.048
[laughs]

18:52.131 --> 18:53.424
He is good man.

18:54.091 --> 18:55.592
All of you...

18:55.677 --> 18:56.678
good.

19:04.226 --> 19:05.477
You shouldn't have done that.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.563
What? Fight for the rights
of the little guy, right?

19:07.647 --> 19:10.733
Fisk wants the tenements,
he's not gonna stop until he gets them.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.652
Well, so what?
We're just supposed to roll over?

19:12.735 --> 19:14.320
Fisk is public on this.

19:14.403 --> 19:15.738
If we tie him up with an injunction,

19:15.822 --> 19:17.489
maybe we find something
in the deposition that we--

19:17.573 --> 19:20.868
Oh, come on, Foggy, you think we're gonna
trip this guy up with a deposition?

19:20.952 --> 19:23.370
After everything that's happened,
you don't get who we're dealing with?

19:23.454 --> 19:24.455
No, we get it!

19:24.538 --> 19:28.375
Matt, he's a rich dickhead who thinks
he can pay people off to kiss his ass.

19:29.626 --> 19:34.423
Look, he is standing on City Hall
with his cronies like he's already won.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.050
You know he can't see that.

19:36.133 --> 19:37.802
All right,
we can't let him get away with this.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.846
-I know.
-[Foggy] So, what are we gonna do?

19:41.263 --> 19:45.935
[sighs] Basic tenet of both law and war,
know your enemy.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.604
Thank you, Sun Tzu.
What does that actually mean?

19:48.688 --> 19:51.733
It means we keep digging.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.693
Like Karen said,
somewhere out there,

19:53.776 --> 19:57.529
there's a piece of paper or a witness,
or something that'll lead to the truth.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.323
Okay, good.

19:59.406 --> 20:03.327
But, do it quietly.
Stay under the radar.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.372
Where are you going?

20:06.455 --> 20:08.875
Three people stood with Fisk
when he addressed the city.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.627
His man from Confed Global,
Owlsley and a woman.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.670
One the press said he seemed close with.

20:13.755 --> 20:16.590
Oh, yeah, uh, Vanessa, um...

20:16.673 --> 20:19.385
Marianna. It says she works
at Scene Contempo Gallery.

20:19.468 --> 20:22.138
Maybe it's time I invested in some art.

20:26.851 --> 20:29.353
[assistant] Here's the list
that I came up with.

20:29.436 --> 20:30.437
Anyone else?

20:30.521 --> 20:32.189
[Vanessa] Make sure Richmond's
on the guest list.

20:32.273 --> 20:35.902
He won't come,
but he'll get pissy if he isn't invited.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.446
[guard on radio] You have a visitor
coming in through the west entrance.

20:55.296 --> 20:56.463
[Vanessa] May I help you?

20:57.381 --> 20:59.675
I hope so. Um, Matthew.

20:59.759 --> 21:00.927
Vanessa.

21:01.010 --> 21:02.845
Vanessa.

21:02.929 --> 21:06.140
You're probably wondering what a man
who can't see is doing in an art gallery.

21:06.223 --> 21:07.266
[laughs]

21:07.349 --> 21:08.935
I didn't want to be forward.

21:09.018 --> 21:10.144
[chuckles]

21:10.227 --> 21:13.439
I'm told by my guests
my apartment's a bit stark.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.274
I thought maybe some art
would warm it up.

21:16.067 --> 21:20.529
I'm going to go out on a limb and
assume these "guests" were women?

21:20.612 --> 21:21.738
[laughs]

21:22.739 --> 21:25.617
Well, I'm not trying
to impress the pizza guy.

21:25.701 --> 21:28.620
Good.
You don't need sight to appreciate art,

21:28.704 --> 21:30.456
but you do need honesty.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.583
-Sight helps.
-Sure.

21:32.666 --> 21:36.503
But there's something very intimate

21:36.587 --> 21:39.673
in experiencing art
through someone else's eyes.

21:40.925 --> 21:42.802
That's a good line, by the way.
You should use it.

21:42.885 --> 21:44.261
[laughs] I might.

21:44.345 --> 21:47.807
So, give me an idea what you're after.

21:47.890 --> 21:49.391
I am not sure.

21:50.726 --> 21:53.020
Good... art isn't furniture.

21:53.104 --> 21:56.899
If you knew exactly what you were
looking for, you'd be just decorating.

21:56.983 --> 22:00.486
Art should speak to you...
move you.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.404
This one, for example.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.283
One of my favorite pieces.

22:10.246 --> 22:11.914
Describe it to me.

22:14.208 --> 22:17.336
Imagine a sea of tonal reds.

22:18.379 --> 22:21.298
The color of anger...

22:21.382 --> 22:23.550
of rage...

22:23.634 --> 22:26.178
but also the color of the heart...

22:26.262 --> 22:29.681
of love... hope.

22:29.765 --> 22:32.935
This strikes the perfect balance
between the two.

22:35.146 --> 22:37.189
I don't know,
it sounds aggressive.

22:38.649 --> 22:40.567
All depends on your point of view.

22:40.651 --> 22:43.570
Maybe something a little less challenging.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.240
Tell me, do you have a man in your life?

22:47.783 --> 22:50.452
Matthew, are you hitting on me?

22:50.536 --> 22:52.746
[chuckling]
No, I just mean, what does he like?

22:52.829 --> 22:54.081
What does he respond to?

22:54.165 --> 22:56.292
If I can get inside the head of the man

22:56.375 --> 22:58.377
who won the heart
of such a charming woman,

22:58.460 --> 23:00.462
it would inform my decision.

23:00.546 --> 23:04.508
Well, you could always ask him yourself.

23:22.151 --> 23:25.196
[distorted] Hope I'm not interrupting.
I was nearby.

23:25.279 --> 23:27.323
[Vanessa] Not at all.
We were just talking about you.

23:28.324 --> 23:29.491
I see.

23:30.576 --> 23:33.537
Wilson Fisk, Matthew...

23:33.620 --> 23:35.206
Murdock.

23:36.707 --> 23:37.874
Oh, yes, the attorney.

23:37.959 --> 23:40.169
I've heard about
all your work in Hell's Kitchen.

23:41.045 --> 23:42.463
Ah.

23:42.546 --> 23:44.381
I'm aware of yours as well.

23:45.674 --> 23:48.052
Mr. Murdock is thinking
of purchasing some art.

23:48.135 --> 23:52.223
He was looking for some advice
from a man of taste.

23:52.306 --> 23:55.851
Well, that's simple.
Buy whatever the lady tells you.

23:55.934 --> 23:58.770
-[Vanessa laughs]
-Thank you.

23:58.854 --> 24:00.439
Although we probably shouldn't be talking.

24:00.522 --> 24:02.566
I believe we're on opposite sides
of a tenancy case.

24:02.649 --> 24:04.485
-Oh, you are?
-Yes.

24:04.568 --> 24:05.736
[Vanessa] Hmm.

24:05.819 --> 24:08.614
The rental properties
I recently acquired from Mr. Tully.

24:09.615 --> 24:12.326
But I'm sure that will be settled
to everyone's benefit.

24:12.409 --> 24:15.746
The city has suffered long enough
under the burden of poverty and decay.

24:16.705 --> 24:19.500
I believe we have opportunities now with--

24:19.583 --> 24:23.712
Wilson, Mr. Murdock is a customer,
not a donor.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.674
Yes, I apologize for the hard sell.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.803
This city and its future...

24:31.887 --> 24:35.891
Seeing Hell's Kitchen to its
fullest potential is very important to me.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.228
I feel the same way.

24:40.854 --> 24:43.107
Vanessa, thank you so much for your time.

24:43.190 --> 24:47.819
Have you changed your mind
about what you came for?

24:47.903 --> 24:50.864
No, no, I would just
need to consider the cost.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.117
Mr. Fisk.

25:28.152 --> 25:31.447
I like to have a moment...
end of the day...

25:32.823 --> 25:34.491
just me and him.

25:37.703 --> 25:40.081
Maybe you could put in a word.

25:40.956 --> 25:44.668
How did you know I was sitting here,
you mind me asking?

25:44.751 --> 25:47.463
You want the short answer
or the long one?

25:47.546 --> 25:48.714
[chuckles]

25:52.593 --> 25:55.346
I was worried you might've gone out
and done something foolish,

25:55.429 --> 25:57.055
after our talk this morning.

25:57.139 --> 25:59.350
[sighs] I haven't done anything.

26:01.102 --> 26:02.603
Not yet.

26:02.686 --> 26:05.564
Sounds a bit on the ominous side.

26:07.483 --> 26:10.236
I went to visit someone close to the...

26:11.945 --> 26:13.071
close to the Devil.

26:13.989 --> 26:17.493
[sighs] Not to hurt her,
just to get a sense of him.

26:18.994 --> 26:21.663
Of who he is
and what it would take to...

26:23.874 --> 26:25.000
do what I have to.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.668
And...

26:28.462 --> 26:30.088
what did you learn?

26:33.759 --> 26:35.761
That he has someone he loves...

26:37.012 --> 26:39.431
who loves him,
who'd mourn his loss.

26:39.515 --> 26:41.016
[Lantom] Mmm-hmm.

26:42.143 --> 26:44.520
Few things are absolute, Matthew.

26:45.729 --> 26:47.939
Even Lucifer was once an angel.

26:48.023 --> 26:51.818
It's why judgment and vengeance...

26:53.028 --> 26:54.571
are best left to God.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.949
Especially when murder
is not in your heart.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.910
[scoffs] How do you know?

26:59.993 --> 27:02.371
You're here, aren't you?

27:04.498 --> 27:07.125
[female automated voice]
Foggy, Foggy, Foggy...

27:07.209 --> 27:08.294
Sorry.

27:08.377 --> 27:09.961
-Foggy, Foggy--
-[phone beeps]

27:13.799 --> 27:15.091
[sighs]

27:19.012 --> 27:21.682
I know my soul is damned
if I take his life.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.977
But if I stand idle, if I...

27:26.812 --> 27:30.482
If I let him consume this city,
all the people that will suffer and die--

27:30.566 --> 27:34.486
There is a wide gulf between
inaction and murder, Matthew.

27:34.570 --> 27:37.989
Another man's evil
does not make you good.

27:38.073 --> 27:41.159
Men have used the atrocities
of their enemies to justify their own

27:41.243 --> 27:43.036
throughout history.

27:43.119 --> 27:46.957
So the question
you have to ask yourself is...

27:47.958 --> 27:52.254
are you struggling with the fact
that you don't wanna kill this man...

27:52.338 --> 27:54.340
but have to?

27:54.423 --> 27:57.175
Or that you don't have to kill him...

27:58.552 --> 28:00.178
but want to?

28:02.473 --> 28:05.684
"Like a muddied spring
or a polluted fountain

28:05.767 --> 28:09.313
is the righteous man
who gives way before the wicked."

28:09.396 --> 28:12.608
Proverbs 25-something,
I never can remember.

28:12.691 --> 28:15.026
Meaning righteous men
have a duty to stand up to evil.

28:15.110 --> 28:17.529
One interpretation.

28:17.613 --> 28:22.743
Another is that when the righteous
succumb to sin, it is as harmful

28:22.826 --> 28:25.787
as if the public well were poisoned.

28:26.538 --> 28:31.710
Because the darkness of such an act...
of taking a life...

28:31.793 --> 28:37.007
will spread to friends, neighbors...

28:38.800 --> 28:40.594
the entire community.

28:44.681 --> 28:46.016
What if it already has?

28:46.099 --> 28:48.227
Then we wouldn't be sitting here,
would we?

28:52.689 --> 28:58.362
I don't believe you went to see this woman
for insight into how to kill a man.

29:00.196 --> 29:01.532
I think...

29:02.741 --> 29:06.453
maybe you went looking
for a reason not to.

29:18.507 --> 29:19.508
Hey!

29:20.426 --> 29:21.510
Hey.

29:21.593 --> 29:25.013
Uh, Foggy, um,
tried to get a hold of you last night.

29:25.096 --> 29:27.140
Oh, yeah, turned off my phone.

29:29.768 --> 29:30.811
You okay?

29:30.894 --> 29:34.565
Yeah, just... tired.

29:34.648 --> 29:38.652
How did it go with that, um...
Vanessa woman?

29:38.735 --> 29:40.446
Oh, I didn't get what I needed.

29:41.196 --> 29:42.864
Oh.

29:42.948 --> 29:44.783
Well, uh, Foggy and I had better luck.

29:44.866 --> 29:49.120
Um, we identified the assholes
that jumped us outside of Elena's.

29:49.204 --> 29:51.373
It's a Stewart Schmidt and Joseph Pike.

29:51.457 --> 29:54.042
-You ID'd them from booking photos?
-No, actually--

29:54.125 --> 29:56.002
Contractor's licenses.

29:56.086 --> 29:58.589
-And where the hell were you?
-Uh... [exhales]

29:58.672 --> 30:00.173
Walking, clearing my head.

30:00.256 --> 30:02.468
Hate when you don't
answer my calls, buddy.

30:02.551 --> 30:04.636
I always think you fell down
an open manhole or something.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.805
[chuckles] I'm fine.
Who's the employer of record?

30:06.888 --> 30:08.432
Westmeyer-Holt Contracting,

30:08.515 --> 30:11.226
another wonderful
Global Confed subsidiary.

30:11.310 --> 30:12.519
Well, that's it. That's great.

30:12.603 --> 30:16.022
We press assault charges,
get them to flip on Fisk.

30:16.106 --> 30:17.232
Yeah, not so much.

30:17.316 --> 30:20.276
I reached out to Ben and his sources say
that they're off the map.

30:20.361 --> 30:22.571
Just like Hoffman and Tully.

30:22.654 --> 30:23.864
Of course they are.

30:23.947 --> 30:26.742
[laughs] Great,
so we have nothing.

30:26.825 --> 30:30.371
I wouldn't go that far.
Here, Foggy, show him the thing.

30:30.454 --> 30:32.623
[Foggy] Right, the thing!

30:32.706 --> 30:33.790
[Matt] What thing?

30:33.874 --> 30:35.626
-[Karen laughs]
-The dream, buddy.

30:39.129 --> 30:41.131
It's just like the one
I drew on the napkin

30:41.214 --> 30:44.092
that you, uh, couldn't see back when.

30:44.175 --> 30:45.511
[Matt] Oh.

30:45.594 --> 30:46.887
[laughs]

30:46.970 --> 30:48.680
-It's a little small, isn't it?
-[Foggy laughs]

30:48.764 --> 30:49.931
Building regulations.

30:50.015 --> 30:53.143
Anyway, so are we.
We are small but awesome.

30:53.226 --> 30:54.895
And we're gonna make a difference.

30:54.978 --> 30:56.897
I know it doesn't
feel like it sometimes...

30:56.980 --> 31:00.191
a lot of the time, but we are,
with the power of the law.

31:00.275 --> 31:02.068
Okay.

31:02.152 --> 31:04.821
Dragged me into this
rinky-dink firm, Murdock...

31:05.697 --> 31:07.491
and I'll never be able
to thank you enough for it.

31:09.284 --> 31:11.036
You're not gonna kiss me.

31:11.119 --> 31:12.621
-I'm feeling a little somethin'.
-[Karen] Oh...

31:12.704 --> 31:14.247
-[Matt] Okay, come here.
-[telephone ringing]

31:16.458 --> 31:18.126
Nelson and Murdock,
how may I help you?

31:18.209 --> 31:19.795
[Matt] Time for those handyman skills.

31:19.878 --> 31:20.962
[Karen] Uh, hey!

31:22.338 --> 31:24.299
[clears throat] Sorry, what?

31:27.678 --> 31:28.679
Um...

31:30.889 --> 31:32.098
Uh, when?

31:37.020 --> 31:38.480
[gasping]

31:42.317 --> 31:43.985
It's her.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.575
How did it happen?

31:50.992 --> 31:53.787
[Brett] Neighbor saw some junkie
they've seen in the building,

31:53.870 --> 31:56.331
fleeing the scene with her purse.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.917
Probably jumped her
while she was fishing for her keys.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.168
[Karen sobs]

32:02.128 --> 32:03.839
Karen, maybe you should wait outside.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.924
[sniffling] No. No, I'm...

32:11.012 --> 32:12.138
How did she die?

32:14.850 --> 32:16.602
Multiple stab wounds.

32:17.853 --> 32:20.396
The ambulance got there quick, but...

32:22.858 --> 32:27.028
My mom says all the family
she knew about's passed on.

32:27.112 --> 32:29.364
I knew you were looking
into her tenancy case.

32:30.532 --> 32:33.494
I thought you might be able
to point us toward the next of kin.

32:33.577 --> 32:34.995
No, she didn't have anyone.

32:36.747 --> 32:37.873
Just us.

32:39.332 --> 32:40.959
We'll see to the arrangements.

32:42.836 --> 32:44.713
It's good of you to take that on.

32:45.881 --> 32:47.841
I'll let the ME know.

33:11.865 --> 33:12.991
[grunting]

33:14.284 --> 33:15.285
Ahhh!

33:30.008 --> 33:31.593
[breathing heavily]

33:35.471 --> 33:38.099
You are a worthy opponent.

33:39.309 --> 33:42.437
It is an honor to claim your life.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.606
[breathing heavily]

33:55.491 --> 33:56.993
[groaning]

34:01.665 --> 34:03.083
-[grunting]
-Ahhh!

34:10.506 --> 34:12.050
[yelling]

34:26.356 --> 34:27.357
[Foggy] Thanks.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.192
I'll keep 'em comin', love.

34:36.742 --> 34:40.829
When we first took the case,
Karen and I went to Landman and Zack.

34:40.912 --> 34:44.207
Marci talked about a "criminal element"
in Elena's building.

34:45.458 --> 34:48.044
Said that's why the workmen left
without finishing the repairs.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.964
"'Cause they feared for their safety."

34:52.382 --> 34:54.550
I thought it was bullshit.

34:56.302 --> 34:57.303
Maybe it was.

34:57.387 --> 34:59.222
Tell that to Elena.

35:00.473 --> 35:01.892
Wait, what are you saying?

35:03.644 --> 35:04.853
Well, I don't know.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.064
Just doesn't feel right, does it?

35:08.148 --> 35:09.858
I'll drink to that.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.652
You think it was a coincidence?

35:15.155 --> 35:16.531
Elena decides to stay and fight,

35:16.615 --> 35:20.326
to rally what's left of her neighbors,
and this happens.

35:20.410 --> 35:24.205
Do you think Fisk
had something to do with this?

35:25.498 --> 35:26.667
Speak of the devil.

35:30.461 --> 35:32.005
Fisk is on the TV again.

35:32.088 --> 35:34.090
Hey, Josie, could you turn that up?

35:35.801 --> 35:38.804
No, I never had the pleasure
of meeting Ms. Cardenas.

35:39.595 --> 35:41.848
I only recently took possession
of her building.

35:41.932 --> 35:46.937
How do you respond to reports
that you knew the tenement was unsafe?

35:47.020 --> 35:48.229
That is accurate.

35:48.313 --> 35:51.983
That's why we offered a substantial sum
to Ms. Cardenas and her neighbors

35:52.067 --> 35:53.568
to help them relocate.

35:55.611 --> 35:58.031
We should never let good people
get swallowed up by this city.

35:59.908 --> 36:01.993
I mourn this woman's death.

36:03.286 --> 36:04.788
Didn't have to happen.
It should've--

36:07.666 --> 36:11.002
Her passing is a symptom
of a larger disease...

36:11.086 --> 36:12.796
-infecting all of us.
-[cell phone ringing]

36:13.504 --> 36:14.630
Disease of fear...

36:14.715 --> 36:15.882
Funeral home.

36:15.966 --> 36:18.468
[Fisk] ...fear of bombings,
fear of cop killings.

36:18.551 --> 36:19.970
Hello?

36:20.053 --> 36:21.930
-Fear of a masked psychopath.
-[Foggy] Yeah, that's me.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.181
Yeah, I need to make arrangements.

36:23.264 --> 36:26.476
[Fisk] We shouldn't let people like that
take our city from us.

36:26.559 --> 36:29.187
We need to stand together.

36:29.270 --> 36:31.231
Let them know that they will fail...

36:32.065 --> 36:34.400
because we believe
we can make a difference.

36:37.237 --> 36:38.697
'Cause they are cowards!

36:39.614 --> 36:42.492
Afraid of stepping out of the shadows.

36:42.575 --> 36:46.121
Afraid of standing up
for people like Mrs. Cardenas.

36:47.580 --> 36:49.916
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.417
Mr. Fisk, how does
this affect the upcoming benefit?

36:51.501 --> 36:52.502
[Wesley] That will be all.
Thank you.

36:52.585 --> 36:53.837
-Mr. Fisk...
-[Wesley] No more questions.

36:53.920 --> 36:56.631
-Thank you very much.
-[man] What can we do about this psycho...

36:59.092 --> 37:01.052
Jesus, he almost sounds like he means it.

37:01.136 --> 37:03.263
-I think he does.
-[Karen scoffs]

37:03.346 --> 37:05.807
And he's calling the man in the mask
a psycho?

37:05.891 --> 37:08.518
I hope they trace what happened to Elena
right to his doorstep.

37:08.601 --> 37:10.436
He'd never expose himself like that.

37:11.855 --> 37:13.940
Plus, half the force
is probably in his pocket.

37:16.026 --> 37:19.237
Well, then, let's pray
the Mask gets his hands on him.

37:20.446 --> 37:22.573
Knocks his goddamn head off.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.414
You religious, Karen?

37:30.456 --> 37:32.042
My parents were.

37:33.501 --> 37:35.628
That's probably why I'm not.

37:37.463 --> 37:38.548
You?

37:40.091 --> 37:41.927
Catholic.

37:45.972 --> 37:47.432
Does it help?

37:48.934 --> 37:50.769
With things like this?

37:52.353 --> 37:53.814
Not today.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.610
I think I've had enough.

38:02.572 --> 38:05.450
-Tell Foggy I'll see him in the morning.
-Yeah.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.039
Hey, Matt.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.248
Yeah?

38:15.293 --> 38:17.378
If there is a God...

38:18.504 --> 38:20.799
and if he cares at all about...

38:20.882 --> 38:23.009
about any of us...

38:25.261 --> 38:27.597
Fisk will get what he deserves.

38:28.849 --> 38:30.641
You have to believe that.

38:32.102 --> 38:33.269
I do.

39:53.141 --> 39:54.600
[sighs]

40:05.528 --> 40:07.113
[both grunting]

40:26.466 --> 40:28.718
-[screaming]
-Look at it.

40:31.387 --> 40:33.598
-Where is he?
-I don't know. [screams]

40:33.681 --> 40:35.058
Tell me what you do know.

40:35.141 --> 40:37.768
[gasping] All right, all right,
I'll tell you anything you want.

40:37.852 --> 40:39.854
Just, please, stop hurting me!

40:41.397 --> 40:42.857
[sighing]

40:59.707 --> 41:01.292
[laughing]

41:07.632 --> 41:09.300
[sniffs]

41:46.254 --> 41:48.089
[laughing]

41:48.173 --> 41:49.215
[gasping]

41:54.804 --> 41:56.847
Hey, you're real, you're...
You're real...

41:57.848 --> 42:00.560
-Where'd you get the purse?
-What purse?

42:05.856 --> 42:07.108
[groans]

42:07.192 --> 42:09.152
Lying? Bad idea.

42:09.235 --> 42:10.945
[screaming]

42:11.029 --> 42:12.697
Please, stop! I'm... I'm sick.

42:14.574 --> 42:17.118
Okay! Okay, the purse!
I'll tell you who snatched it--

42:21.331 --> 42:24.667
Listen, I've hurt a lot of people tonight
to get what I need to know.

42:24.750 --> 42:27.837
The asshole that killed Mrs. Cardenas
shoots up at this address,

42:27.920 --> 42:29.004
likes cheap menthols.

42:29.089 --> 42:32.633
Thinks it covers the stench
of his rotting teeth. It doesn't.

42:32.717 --> 42:34.260
-[grunts]
-[whimpers]

42:35.261 --> 42:36.596
Who paid you?

42:36.679 --> 42:38.973
-[sobbing] No, I don't, I don't...
-Was it Fisk?

42:40.350 --> 42:41.351
Was it Fisk?

42:41.434 --> 42:43.061
[incoherent]

42:43.144 --> 42:44.604
Was it Wilson Fisk?

42:44.687 --> 42:47.440
No, I don't know!
Please, stop! Please!

42:47.523 --> 42:48.524
Give me a reason to!

42:48.608 --> 42:52.027
I don't know their names. I don't!
They found me.

42:52.112 --> 42:54.239
They took me
to a warehouse on the water...

42:54.322 --> 42:55.865
Pier 81.

42:55.948 --> 42:57.533
I didn't wanna do it, man.

42:57.617 --> 42:59.952
I swear.
I didn't wanna do it!

43:00.035 --> 43:03.123
But I was hurting.
I was hurting, man.

43:04.082 --> 43:05.791
[breathing heavily]
Shut up!

43:09.629 --> 43:10.713
You're gonna turn yourself in...

43:12.132 --> 43:15.510
to Sergeant Brett Mahoney
at the 15th Precinct.

43:15.593 --> 43:19.847
If you don't, I'll find you.
And next time, I'm not gonna stop.

43:49.669 --> 43:51.504
[heart beating slowly]

44:04.934 --> 44:06.769
[heart beating quickly]

44:16.696 --> 44:18.989
I didn't come here for you.

44:21.492 --> 44:24.119
[Nobu] But I am the one
you have found.

44:38.133 --> 44:41.304
You were at the docks with the boy.

44:41.387 --> 44:43.931
[Nobu] As were you...

44:44.014 --> 44:45.683
with the old fool.

44:47.268 --> 44:49.479
That was unexpected.

44:50.145 --> 44:51.731
I'm not part of his war.

44:52.732 --> 44:54.567
[Nobu] Yet you aided him.

44:55.651 --> 44:59.280
And in the act, caused me displeasure.

45:02.032 --> 45:03.784
Did Fisk send you?

45:05.495 --> 45:07.247
Is that why he paid that junkie to--

45:07.330 --> 45:08.414
[scoffs]

45:10.333 --> 45:15.338
A woman is dead, and for what?
Just to lure me into some kind of a trap?

45:15.421 --> 45:19.509
You are here, are you not?

45:19.592 --> 45:21.886
[Masked Man]
I knew no one was in the building.

45:23.053 --> 45:26.098
Made that mistake with the Russians once.
Learned from it.

45:26.181 --> 45:29.184
[Nobu] But you did not know I was here.

45:30.478 --> 45:31.937
[Masked Man] No...

45:33.063 --> 45:34.899
you slowed your heart...

45:36.901 --> 45:39.194
lowered your body temperature.

45:39.279 --> 45:41.614
[Nobu] The old fool
has taught you in our ways.

45:41.697 --> 45:43.283
[Masked Man] I told you I'm not with him.

45:43.366 --> 45:45.451
[Nobu] Yet you're still a warrior...

45:47.370 --> 45:49.414
deserving of a warrior's death.

45:49.497 --> 45:51.832
I came here for Fisk.

45:53.208 --> 45:54.919
Guess I'll have to settle for you.

45:59.382 --> 46:01.301
[Nobu] I show you respect.

46:02.718 --> 46:05.680
You would be wise to return the courtesy.

46:07.307 --> 46:08.933
You'll have to earn it.

46:11.686 --> 46:12.728
[grunting]

46:42.425 --> 46:44.594
-Shit, sorry.
-[Karen clears throat]

46:46.971 --> 46:48.514
[slurring] Hey, can I get
another bottle over here?

46:48.598 --> 46:51.684
No, no, never mind, Josie.
Hey, hey, Foggy.

46:51.767 --> 46:54.979
Foggy, I've had enough,
and you have had... [exhales]

46:55.062 --> 46:56.564
way, way past that.

46:56.647 --> 46:58.065
It's a wake, Karen.

46:59.400 --> 47:00.985
People drink at wakes.

47:01.068 --> 47:02.152
You don't need it.

47:02.236 --> 47:03.571
You know why?

47:04.697 --> 47:05.823
'Cause it sucks.

47:05.906 --> 47:07.367
[softly] I know.

47:08.325 --> 47:09.827
You speak Spanish.

47:11.328 --> 47:13.998
What's a good toast
for the people that should...

47:14.081 --> 47:15.791
-That should still...
-Hey.

47:16.876 --> 47:18.085
Hey, hey, hey.

47:18.168 --> 47:20.421
[sobbing] I should have told her
to take the money like Matt said.

47:20.505 --> 47:22.382
No, no, no, no, Foggy...

47:22.465 --> 47:25.968
it's not your fault, okay?

47:28.679 --> 47:29.930
[sniffles]

47:32.933 --> 47:35.561
The Hell's Kitchen I grew up in
was a real shithole.

47:35.645 --> 47:37.187
But it had a heart, you know?

47:37.271 --> 47:39.231
Yeah.

47:39.314 --> 47:42.527
Me and Matt...
we learned the law...

47:42.610 --> 47:44.404
how to play by the rules.

47:45.780 --> 47:48.408
We were gonna help the people
that we grew up with.

47:48.491 --> 47:51.201
Give 'em the same shot
as the big boys like Fisk.

47:53.496 --> 47:54.580
It's all bullshit.

47:55.790 --> 47:56.874
It's all just...

47:56.957 --> 47:59.752
lies that we tell ourselves
to make it through one more day.

47:59.835 --> 48:02.713
No, I don't...
I don't believe that.

48:02.797 --> 48:04.465
I can't.

48:06.258 --> 48:09.053
What are we supposed to do...

48:09.136 --> 48:13.933
against somebody that owns everything?

48:14.016 --> 48:15.309
Everyone?

48:18.854 --> 48:20.773
What can we do to somebody like that?

48:21.774 --> 48:23.776
The only thing you can...

48:26.403 --> 48:28.405
you make them pay.

48:30.199 --> 48:31.659
[Masked Man screaming]

48:38.082 --> 48:39.625
[grunting]

48:50.470 --> 48:52.763
[grunts]

48:55.558 --> 48:57.560
[Nobu] You have fought well.

48:57.643 --> 48:59.061
[Masked Man groaning]

48:59.144 --> 49:02.231
[Nobu] It is... not enough.

49:16.370 --> 49:18.122
[Nobu yelling]

49:28.340 --> 49:29.675
[groaning]

49:31.093 --> 49:32.427
[Fisk] Thank you.

49:34.054 --> 49:36.140
Nobu was becoming an issue.

49:38.017 --> 49:41.854
I appreciate you...
removing him from concern.

49:41.937 --> 49:43.313
[Masked Man laughs]

49:43.397 --> 49:46.233
[groaning] You...
wanted me to do this.

49:46.316 --> 49:50.530
In a perfect world, you would have
taken each other out, but...

49:51.531 --> 49:54.700
it isn't a perfect world, is it?

49:54.784 --> 49:56.035
Not yet.

49:57.452 --> 50:01.165
To be honest...
it took longer than I expected.

50:02.374 --> 50:05.085
Nobu didn't mind.
He meditated for hours.

50:05.169 --> 50:07.547
I find it difficult to meditate.

50:07.630 --> 50:10.257
My mind, it won't quiet.

50:11.425 --> 50:14.011
[muttering]
It's a character flaw, I suppose.

50:15.888 --> 50:17.514
We all have them.

50:19.224 --> 50:20.475
You, for instance.

50:21.310 --> 50:25.898
You've demonstrated an emotional weakness
for children and women.

50:25.981 --> 50:28.776
I assumed that would extend
to the elderly.

50:30.110 --> 50:31.904
So I baited the hook.

50:33.614 --> 50:35.199
Here you are.

50:35.282 --> 50:37.827
[panting] You took her life...

50:39.328 --> 50:42.081
just to get my attention?

50:42.164 --> 50:44.625
[Fisk] Nobu forced my hand in the matter.

50:46.043 --> 50:49.672
My options,
they were limited by necessity.

50:50.881 --> 50:53.050
I took no pleasure in her passing.

50:54.093 --> 50:57.304
[breathing heavily] I'm... gonna kill you.

51:03.560 --> 51:05.312
Take your shot.

51:08.691 --> 51:10.818
[both grunting]

51:37.011 --> 51:38.512
[grunting]

51:43.558 --> 51:46.270
[yelling]

51:57.156 --> 51:59.408
[Masked Man groaning]

52:11.796 --> 52:13.798
It's disappointing.

52:18.593 --> 52:20.345
Wesley.

52:30.230 --> 52:31.816
-[metal clinking]
-[gun firing]

52:32.607 --> 52:34.026
[gunfire continues]

52:56.631 --> 52:58.801
Put men on the dock.

52:58.884 --> 53:01.721
If they see the Mask,
put a bullet in him.

53:05.975 --> 53:07.559
What about Nobu?

53:10.771 --> 53:12.606
Let him burn.

53:19.696 --> 53:21.406
Matt!

53:21.490 --> 53:22.783
Come on, Matt.

53:22.867 --> 53:25.202
I need to talk to you, Matt.

53:27.287 --> 53:28.580
[sighing]

53:29.790 --> 53:31.834
[hoarsely]
We need to keep going, Matt.

53:33.710 --> 53:36.171
We gotta nail that bastard to the wall.

53:36.255 --> 53:39.174
We gotta make him pay...
for Elena...

53:40.843 --> 53:42.469
-for everything.
-[clattering]

53:44.972 --> 53:45.973
Matt?

53:46.056 --> 53:49.476
Are you okay in there? Matt?

53:51.812 --> 53:52.938
Matt!

53:58.819 --> 53:59.945
Matt?

54:05.242 --> 54:07.036
[Foggy] It's me.

54:07.119 --> 54:08.620
I heard a crash.

54:10.289 --> 54:13.542
Not the fun, sexy-time kind, but...

54:15.335 --> 54:16.879
more of the...

54:16.962 --> 54:19.214
I've-fallen-and-I-can't-get-up variety.

54:22.802 --> 54:23.928
Matt?

54:40.820 --> 54:42.822
[nervously] If anyone who's in here
is not supposed to be,

54:42.905 --> 54:45.282
I will mess you up.
I'm not kidding.

54:49.619 --> 54:52.122
[groaning weakly]

54:55.334 --> 54:58.045
Where's Matt?
What'd you do to him?

55:12.059 --> 55:13.185
Shit.

55:19.942 --> 55:21.776
[line ringing]

55:26.281 --> 55:27.574
[cell phone beeps]

55:51.098 --> 55:52.307
[gasps]

55:54.101 --> 55:55.602
Matt?

55:59.564 --> 56:01.191
[dramatic music playing]
