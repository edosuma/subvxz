WEBVTT

01:37.083 --> 01:39.458
I see it as a privilege,

01:39.541 --> 01:42.208
to be called upon
to provide a new limb,

01:42.291 --> 01:45.958
a new lung,
for this mighty city of ours.

01:52.708 --> 01:55.708
Together, gentlemen,
we are taking a step forward

01:55.791 --> 01:57.791
into our shared future,

01:57.875 --> 02:00.791
helped by the new technology

02:00.875 --> 02:01.791
which makes
what would have been

02:01.875 --> 02:03.958
quite impossible
for our parents

02:04.041 --> 02:07.583
only too possible for us
and for our children.

02:07.666 --> 02:10.250
This is a great day
for New York,

02:10.333 --> 02:12.708
one that should, and will,

02:12.791 --> 02:15.708
shed glory
on every man in this room.

02:15.791 --> 02:17.666
I thank you for your support.

02:21.625 --> 02:22.750
Mr. White.

02:24.166 --> 02:26.416
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you

02:26.500 --> 02:28.416
Union Central Station.

02:41.958 --> 02:44.125
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thank you.

02:44.208 --> 02:46.208
- Bravo.
- Amazing.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.416
Well done.

02:53.041 --> 02:54.583
Thank you, thank you.

02:56.208 --> 02:57.458
- I'd like to see that.
Should I...

02:57.541 --> 02:59.416
- Thank you.
- I told him...

02:59.500 --> 03:01.041
- Gentlemen,
thank you for coming...

03:01.125 --> 03:02.333
- Are you sure
this is the right moment?

03:02.416 --> 03:03.625
I won't get a better one,

03:03.708 --> 03:05.333
after the reception
he's had here.

03:05.416 --> 03:06.416
I hope you're right.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.166
Congratulations, Mr. White.

03:08.250 --> 03:10.041
They like your work
quite as much as I do.

03:10.125 --> 03:11.666
- Congratulations
to both of you.

03:12.958 --> 03:15.041
- He's done a wonderful job,
hasn't he, Father?

03:15.125 --> 03:17.416
- Wonderful.
- I find it very inspiring.

03:17.500 --> 03:19.541
Architecture, I mean.

03:19.625 --> 03:23.250
That's why
I'd like to be an architect.

03:25.125 --> 03:27.541
- I don't understand you.
What?

03:27.625 --> 03:29.291
- He wants to study
architecture.

03:29.375 --> 03:32.000
- And, of course, I'd be
only too happy to help him.

03:32.958 --> 03:34.125
Where has this come from?

03:34.208 --> 03:35.833
- I've been trying to tell you
for some time.

03:35.916 --> 03:36.958
No, you haven't.

03:37.041 --> 03:39.291
- Well, I've wanted
to tell you.

03:39.375 --> 03:41.125
But you have a job.

03:41.208 --> 03:43.458
- Here, with me.
- I know. But--

03:43.541 --> 03:45.583
- Mr. Russell, I think
that Larry just wants

03:45.666 --> 03:48.208
to learn about the principles
of architecture.

03:48.291 --> 03:50.958
After three or four years,
he could then employ his skills

03:51.041 --> 03:53.083
in the management
of your business interests.

03:53.166 --> 03:55.041
- Is that what you want?
- No.

03:55.125 --> 03:56.958
I want to be an architect.

03:57.041 --> 03:58.750
You see, Mr. White?

03:58.833 --> 04:01.750
My son disdains
your peacemaking compromise.

04:01.833 --> 04:03.375
I believe Larry has talent,

04:03.458 --> 04:04.916
if that might make
a difference.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.250
It won't.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.250
And now I'll put your mother
and sister into the carriage.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.916
Please see to our guests.

04:16.750 --> 04:18.875
- But what do I say to Oscar
when he gets here?

04:18.958 --> 04:21.083
What can I say?

04:21.166 --> 04:23.208
That he has disgraced
his character?

04:23.291 --> 04:25.125
His name?

04:25.208 --> 04:26.875
And his mother?

04:26.958 --> 04:28.000
Well...

04:28.083 --> 04:29.208
What do you mean, "Well"?

04:29.291 --> 04:31.750
- Only that all men,
or almost all,

04:31.833 --> 04:33.458
have a fling of some sort
when they're young,

04:33.541 --> 04:34.875
and they live to tell the tale.

04:34.958 --> 04:37.333
- Oh. This is a tale
I'd rather were not told.

04:37.416 --> 04:39.500
- I just think
these things happen.

04:39.583 --> 04:40.875
How do you know?

04:40.958 --> 04:42.291
Have you been leading
a double life?

04:42.375 --> 04:46.416
- No, but I'm not so simple
that I don't know what goes on.

04:46.500 --> 04:49.208
- You'll be calling yourself
a woman of the world next.

04:49.291 --> 04:52.000
- Well, I'm not Rip Van Winkle,
Agnes.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.916
And I understand that young men
have to sow their wild oats.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.375
Even if that were true,

04:57.458 --> 04:59.541
they do not have to sow them
with servants.

04:59.625 --> 05:02.041
- What would you prefer?
An actress?

05:02.125 --> 05:04.375
- Or a prostitute?
- Ada!

05:04.458 --> 05:06.541
I'm going to have to ring
for my smelling salts

05:06.625 --> 05:08.041
if you do not moderate
your tone.

05:08.125 --> 05:09.416
You should not even know
these words exist.

05:09.500 --> 05:10.708
Well, I do.

05:10.791 --> 05:12.916
And I know that
well brought up young ladies

05:13.000 --> 05:14.833
are not the girls
lighting the cigars

05:14.916 --> 05:16.833
of their escorts
at Delmonico's.

05:16.916 --> 05:19.666
- You are forcing me
to reevaluate your character.

05:19.750 --> 05:21.666
I can't help that.

05:21.750 --> 05:24.000
- The point is, he's coming
for dinner this evening,

05:24.083 --> 05:25.250
and I don't know what to do.

05:25.333 --> 05:26.250
I should do nothing.

05:26.333 --> 05:28.916
Do nothing and say nothing.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.875
But of course,
you won't listen to me.

05:32.416 --> 05:35.375
- Mrs. Bauer asks if she might
have a precise time

05:35.458 --> 05:37.166
to serve the first course
this evening.

05:39.541 --> 05:40.750
Agnes?

05:42.208 --> 05:44.583
- Ada, dear,
would you tell Mrs. Bauer

05:44.666 --> 05:46.916
I think it would be nice
to sit down to dinner tonight

05:47.000 --> 05:48.375
at half past eight?

05:51.333 --> 05:52.375
Thank you, Bannister.

05:58.416 --> 05:59.375
Well done.

05:59.458 --> 06:00.541
That was quite a trick
with the lighting.

06:00.625 --> 06:02.208
It was only a battery.

06:02.291 --> 06:03.583
By the time
the station is built,

06:03.666 --> 06:05.833
electricity will be
part of our lives.

06:05.916 --> 06:07.291
Edison is mounting
a demonstration

06:07.375 --> 06:09.083
- on September 4th.
- What's he got planned?

06:09.166 --> 06:11.166
- First, he'll switch on
his plant on Pearl Street.

06:11.250 --> 06:12.833
But later, at 10:00,

06:12.916 --> 06:14.708
he will illuminate the offices
of "The New York Times"

06:14.791 --> 06:15.750
on Park Row.

06:15.833 --> 06:17.000
- How do you know
so much about it?

06:17.083 --> 06:18.416
He invited me to attend.

06:18.500 --> 06:19.791
I'm to meet him
for a terribly grand dinner

06:19.875 --> 06:21.125
in time
for the evening illuminations.

06:21.208 --> 06:23.125
- Well, why didn't you
say this before?

06:23.208 --> 06:24.416
- I didn't think
it would interest you.

06:24.500 --> 06:25.791
Of course it does.

06:25.875 --> 06:28.875
All I want to know is,
how long do we have to wait

06:28.958 --> 06:30.625
before we install it at home?

06:30.708 --> 06:32.333
Oh, one thing.

06:32.416 --> 06:34.666
Clay and I are meeting lawyers
after this,

06:34.750 --> 06:35.958
so I may be home late.

06:36.041 --> 06:37.500
- We'll get through this,
George.

06:37.583 --> 06:39.083
We just have to be strong.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.208
You always hearten me,

06:40.291 --> 06:41.916
with your confidence
of victory.

06:46.166 --> 06:47.583
What will you do with that?

06:47.666 --> 06:49.125
You don't have a bank account.

06:49.208 --> 06:51.833
- Perhaps I plan to open one,
Mrs. Bauer.

06:51.916 --> 06:53.833
And I'm going to find out
who wrote that letter

06:53.916 --> 06:56.083
to Mrs. Van Rhijn
if it's the last thing I do.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.208
How?

06:57.291 --> 06:59.666
It could have been anyone
in the Russells' house.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.500
Someone will know who did it.

07:09.083 --> 07:10.333
Whoa, there!

07:10.416 --> 07:11.541
Cheer up, Mr. Russell.

07:11.625 --> 07:13.833
- It can't be as bad as all that.
- Can't it?

07:13.916 --> 07:16.041
I've quarreled with my father.

07:16.125 --> 07:17.500
Or at least we soon will.

07:17.583 --> 07:19.833
- Is this over architecture?
- How did you know?

07:19.916 --> 07:22.750
- Because you told me, that day
outside Mr. White's office.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.583
Ah.

07:24.666 --> 07:26.625
- You must
give your father time.

07:26.708 --> 07:29.166
He loves you.
He won't want to fall out.

07:29.250 --> 07:30.958
- When my father loves,
Miss Brook,

07:31.041 --> 07:32.791
there is a price to be paid.

07:32.875 --> 07:35.166
I cannot deviate
from his ambitions.

07:35.250 --> 07:37.625
Mother, me, Gladys,
we must all keep to the steps

07:37.708 --> 07:39.166
he has laid down.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.791
- You have one life,
Mr. Russell.

07:41.875 --> 07:43.708
If you take the wrong path,
you will pay the price

07:43.791 --> 07:45.375
for many years.

07:45.458 --> 07:47.833
Now I must escort Pumpkin home.

07:49.500 --> 07:50.541
Good day.

07:57.458 --> 08:00.166
- Mistress is getting up
a party for September 4th

08:00.250 --> 08:02.333
when Mr. Edison turns on
his electric lights.

08:02.416 --> 08:04.208
- Why the fuss
about Mr. Edison?

08:04.291 --> 08:06.333
We've known about electricity
for a hundred years.

08:06.416 --> 08:08.875
And there have been
electric storms for centuries.

08:08.958 --> 08:11.333
- But Mr. Edison has tamed it,
Miss Turner.

08:11.416 --> 08:12.500
He has mastered it.

08:12.583 --> 08:14.791
He knows how to make it,
how to store it, how to use it

08:14.875 --> 08:17.041
- for our benefit.
- I think it's exciting.

08:17.125 --> 08:18.208
Is it?

08:18.291 --> 08:21.250
When electricity comes,
half our jobs go up in smoke.

08:21.333 --> 08:23.916
Cooking, cleaning, it'll
all be done with electricity

08:24.000 --> 08:25.041
before you know it.

08:25.125 --> 08:26.500
- What is the mistress planning
for the night

08:26.583 --> 08:27.875
when the lights are turned on?

08:27.958 --> 08:29.750
- Not a large party,
and not here.

08:29.833 --> 08:31.625
- It's more of a picnic.
Eight people.

08:31.708 --> 08:34.541
Four in the landau, four
in another rented carriage.

08:34.625 --> 08:37.333
They'll meet here at 7:00
and drive to Park Row.

08:37.416 --> 08:40.250
They'll dine in the carriages
to make sure of a good place

08:40.333 --> 08:42.875
and watch Edison illuminate
the "Times" building at 10:00.

08:42.958 --> 08:44.583
Who will they get to serve?

08:44.666 --> 08:46.416
- Two of the footmen can go
as postilions.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.541
They'll manage.

08:47.625 --> 08:49.875
- I wonder who she's planning
to hook into her scheme.

08:49.958 --> 08:51.375
The Fanes will be there.

08:51.458 --> 08:54.250
But I think she'll try
for Mr. McAllister again,

08:54.333 --> 08:57.125
if she can persuade him
to be seen with her in public.

08:57.208 --> 08:59.708
- I'm sure he'd be very glad
to be seen with her in public.

08:59.791 --> 09:01.541
- Even you don't believe that,
Mrs. Bruce.

09:01.625 --> 09:03.791
But he may tolerate it
for the sake of a good dinner

09:03.875 --> 09:05.500
and a decent seat
for the display.

09:05.583 --> 09:08.666
- Please give us a rest from
your nastiness, Miss Turner.

09:08.750 --> 09:10.333
What's that, Mr. Church?

09:14.500 --> 09:16.458
My golly.

09:16.541 --> 09:18.666
- I thought we might practice
in here.

09:18.750 --> 09:20.625
- We could rehearse a new
production of "Aida" in here

09:20.708 --> 09:22.291
and still have plenty
of room to spare.

09:22.375 --> 09:24.916
- The thing is, I assume
we need some more people.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.666
Six more for a quadrille.

09:26.750 --> 09:28.875
Two more girls and four men,
but don't worry.

09:28.958 --> 09:30.375
Angela Schermerhorn
loves dancing,

09:30.458 --> 09:31.583
and she's a cousin of mine.

09:31.666 --> 09:32.708
And Sally Drexel.

09:32.791 --> 09:35.083
And I can easily round up
a few young men.

09:35.166 --> 09:37.000
- Maybe we could ask
Orme Wilson.

09:38.041 --> 09:39.916
Why is your mother
so dead set against him?

09:40.000 --> 09:42.291
Judging by the society pages,
his family goes everywhere.

09:42.375 --> 09:45.041
- That's the problem.
She thinks them pushy.

09:45.125 --> 09:47.166
The father was a war profiteer,
or so they say,

09:47.250 --> 09:48.708
and the sister has married
Ogden Goelet,

09:48.791 --> 09:50.833
one of the richest men
in America.

09:50.916 --> 09:52.875
Of course, everyone thinks
he's been caught.

09:52.958 --> 09:55.333
- So your mother doesn't trust
Mr. Wilson's motives?

09:55.416 --> 09:57.958
- To put it mildly.
- But you do?

09:58.041 --> 09:59.083
To put it mildly.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.541
- In that case,
we'll definitely have him

10:00.625 --> 10:02.708
as one of our dancers.

10:02.791 --> 10:04.458
- We need to be able
to tell anyone we ask

10:04.541 --> 10:06.583
when the ball is happening.

10:06.666 --> 10:09.291
- Then we'd better call it off.
- Why do you say that?

10:09.375 --> 10:11.250
Because you won't set a date.

10:11.333 --> 10:12.666
Every time I ask, you refuse.

10:12.750 --> 10:14.083
- That was before
the house was ready.

10:14.166 --> 10:15.291
Now it is.

10:15.375 --> 10:17.625
I'll write to Mr. McAllister
to find a date that's free.

10:17.708 --> 10:19.458
We don't want to be
in competition.

10:19.541 --> 10:20.625
What's changed, Mother?

10:20.708 --> 10:22.625
- Why are you talking
as if I meant you to be

10:22.708 --> 10:25.625
the first debutante in the city
who never made her debut?

10:25.708 --> 10:27.541
We'll get a pianist in
for your practice.

10:27.625 --> 10:29.375
And perhaps you have the name
of a dancing instructor?

10:29.458 --> 10:30.500
Of course.

10:30.583 --> 10:32.375
- The men and girls who will
join in your quadrille,

10:32.458 --> 10:33.875
should I ask their parents
if they mind?

10:33.958 --> 10:35.708
- Oh, no,
they'll all love Gladys.

10:35.791 --> 10:37.041
And they're dying
to see inside this house.

10:37.125 --> 10:38.208
Everyone is.

10:38.291 --> 10:40.208
- Well, I'll ask them
to the ball

10:40.291 --> 10:41.625
so they can watch
their children perform.

10:41.708 --> 10:43.208
They mustn't miss that.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.500
- Gentlemen, I suppose
my first question is,

10:50.583 --> 10:54.125
have you seen the paper
that Mr. Dixon says I sent him?

10:54.208 --> 10:55.791
- Mr. Brand?
- I've seen it.

10:55.875 --> 10:57.916
I'm afraid it appears genuine.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.208
We'll have a handwriting expert
examine it, of course.

11:00.291 --> 11:02.750
But we can't expect
too much from that.

11:02.833 --> 11:04.291
What does it say, exactly?

11:06.958 --> 11:09.625
- "The price is ridiculous.
Find a cheaper option.

11:09.708 --> 11:12.416
I don't care what it takes
or how you do it."

11:12.500 --> 11:14.541
Followed by your signature.

11:14.625 --> 11:18.000
He's lost the envelope,
but that won't help us.

11:18.083 --> 11:20.583
Certainly sounds like me.

11:20.666 --> 11:22.416
Can we confront this Dixon?

11:22.500 --> 11:23.916
- There'll be
a preliminary hearing.

11:24.000 --> 11:24.958
We'll face him there.

11:25.041 --> 11:27.041
- But didn't we pay
the full price?

11:27.125 --> 11:29.375
What happened to the money,
Mr. Lewis?

11:29.458 --> 11:32.375
- Dixon claims the estimate
was submitted for payment

11:32.458 --> 11:33.916
without his knowledge.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.208
- So where's the money now?
- Missing.

11:36.291 --> 11:38.708
But not traceable to him,
unfortunately.

11:38.791 --> 11:40.958
- Doesn't that strengthen
Mr. Russell's case?

11:41.041 --> 11:43.041
- It depends whom the judge
chooses to believe

11:43.125 --> 11:44.125
at the hearing.

11:44.208 --> 11:45.333
If he believes Mr. Russell,

11:45.416 --> 11:47.541
then Dixon will go forward
for trial.

11:47.625 --> 11:50.166
And Mr. Russell will only
be called as a witness.

11:50.250 --> 11:51.625
But if he believes Dixon?

11:51.708 --> 11:53.291
- Then Mr. Russell
may be charged

11:53.375 --> 11:55.208
with manslaughter
by negligence.

11:55.291 --> 11:57.458
That is very pessimistic.

11:57.541 --> 12:00.291
- Mr. Russell should be ready
for the worst.

12:00.375 --> 12:02.208
Believe me,

12:02.291 --> 12:04.791
Mr. Russell is always ready
for the worst.

12:07.083 --> 12:08.291
Cousin Oscar.

12:13.708 --> 12:15.125
Is everything all right?

12:15.208 --> 12:16.875
Oscar's gone.

12:16.958 --> 12:19.291
He's angry with me,
but he has no right to be.

12:19.375 --> 12:20.583
I'm the one to be angry.

12:20.666 --> 12:22.416
Why? What's happened?

12:22.500 --> 12:24.583
Oscar has disgraced himself.

12:24.666 --> 12:26.916
With Mrs. Russell's maid.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.291
How democratic.

12:28.375 --> 12:30.625
It is no laughing matter.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.125
Really.

12:32.208 --> 12:34.916
On top of Bannister's betrayal,
it is too much.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.500
Oscar tried to deny it.

12:36.583 --> 12:39.000
- Are you telling this story,
or am I?

12:39.083 --> 12:41.500
Although, why either of us
are telling it to Marian,

12:41.583 --> 12:42.750
I do not know.

12:42.833 --> 12:45.083
- He said they were friendly
acquaintances and that was all.

12:45.166 --> 12:46.333
- Well, I suppose--

12:46.416 --> 12:47.458
As if my son

12:47.541 --> 12:50.458
would number a lady's maid
among his friends.

12:50.541 --> 12:52.333
Even Ada thought
that was nonsense,

12:52.416 --> 12:54.375
and she barely knows
how babies are born.

12:54.458 --> 12:57.291
- Agnes, your anger
is making you indelicate.

12:57.375 --> 12:58.791
So what happens now?

13:00.083 --> 13:01.458
I want her sacked.

13:01.541 --> 13:04.083
I want her out on her ear
by tomorrow night.

13:04.166 --> 13:06.000
- Then you must write
to Mrs. Russell.

13:06.083 --> 13:07.125
What would I say?

13:07.208 --> 13:09.375
My mother always told me
never to write anything

13:09.458 --> 13:11.291
I wouldn't want printed
on the letters page

13:11.375 --> 13:12.458
of a popular journal.

13:12.541 --> 13:15.333
- Then what will you do?
- I'll do nothing.

13:16.875 --> 13:19.250
You will go and see
Mrs. Russell.

13:19.333 --> 13:22.041
After all, you know her.
I do not.

13:22.125 --> 13:23.583
But it isn't my quarrel.

13:23.666 --> 13:26.375
- Your family's honor
is in danger.

13:26.458 --> 13:27.583
Certainly it is your quarrel.

13:27.666 --> 13:29.250
- What right have I
to ask a woman

13:29.333 --> 13:31.708
to fire her own servant?

13:31.791 --> 13:33.875
- It's an impossible task.
- Marian.

13:33.958 --> 13:37.416
I may be didactic,
but I do not often give orders.

13:37.500 --> 13:41.000
This is a direct order.
Will you defy me?

13:41.083 --> 13:42.916
Is that what we have come to?

13:44.625 --> 13:46.000
<i>Did you hear the noise?</i>

13:46.083 --> 13:49.166
I was in the hall when Mistress
started shouting at Mr. Oscar.

13:49.250 --> 13:51.125
Then he marched out
and slammed the door.

13:51.208 --> 13:53.166
- Which made one less
for dinner,

13:53.250 --> 13:55.458
And we got the rest
of the ice cream to share.

13:55.541 --> 13:56.541
These things happen.

13:56.625 --> 13:58.166
- You don't sound
very surprised.

13:58.250 --> 13:59.750
With a mother and son,

13:59.833 --> 14:01.750
there's bound to be
fireworks sometimes.

14:01.833 --> 14:03.083
- You don't know
what it's about?

14:03.166 --> 14:05.791
- Please, we owe it
to Mrs. Van Rhijn not to pry.

14:05.875 --> 14:08.791
- You won't get back into
her good graces that easily.

14:08.875 --> 14:10.916
Oh, silly me.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.416
I've left some things upstairs
that I need to wash

14:13.500 --> 14:14.541
before I sleep.

14:18.666 --> 14:20.250
- She knows more
than she's saying.

14:20.333 --> 14:22.541
- All ladies' maids know
more than they say.

14:25.166 --> 14:28.333
- Church said you were here.
- I told him to.

14:28.416 --> 14:29.541
I hope you don't mind
that I haven't changed.

14:29.625 --> 14:30.833
Not at all.

14:30.916 --> 14:32.416
Did the lawyers
keep you this late?

14:32.500 --> 14:34.875
- No, but after they'd gone,
I stayed talking to Clay,

14:34.958 --> 14:36.250
poor devil.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.958
I doubt anyone's
kept dinner for him.

14:38.041 --> 14:40.125
And?

14:40.208 --> 14:41.833
There'll be a hearing

14:41.916 --> 14:43.458
to determine
if a crime's been committed

14:43.541 --> 14:45.416
and whether
it should go for trial.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.458
- Well, haven't they already
found the man to blame?

14:47.541 --> 14:49.333
That depends.

14:49.416 --> 14:51.333
Some people may think the man
to blame is your husband.

14:51.416 --> 14:52.833
- Don't joke about this,
George.

14:52.916 --> 14:54.625
- I'm not joking.
- We can't afford a scandal.

14:54.708 --> 14:55.875
Not when I'm so near.

14:55.958 --> 14:57.791
I'm taking a party
to see Mr. Edison's lights,

14:57.875 --> 14:59.083
and I've set a date
for Gladys's ball.

14:59.166 --> 15:00.083
I'm glad to hear it.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.416
- But it won't happen
if you're on trial.

15:01.500 --> 15:02.416
I'd have to cancel.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.250
- My dear,
I don't make the rules.

15:04.333 --> 15:06.041
I will do everything within
my power to defend myself.

15:06.125 --> 15:07.208
What more can I say?

15:07.291 --> 15:08.958
- But I've already settled
a date with Mr. McAllister.

15:09.041 --> 15:11.416
- Well, God forbid
I should be a disappointment

15:11.500 --> 15:13.291
- for Mr. McAllister.
- If you think this is funny--

15:13.375 --> 15:15.125
- I don't think it
in the least funny

15:15.208 --> 15:16.583
that I'm facing
the possibility of prison,

15:16.666 --> 15:19.541
and my wife is more concerned
with the date of a ball.

15:50.041 --> 15:52.458
- Mr. Fortune.
- Good day, Miss Scott.

15:52.541 --> 15:54.625
- I've left the draft
of my article on your desk.

15:54.708 --> 15:55.833
I'll take a look.

15:55.916 --> 15:58.708
Tell me, what are your thoughts
on electricity?

15:58.791 --> 16:00.833
- Are you talking
about Mr. Edison's lights?

16:00.916 --> 16:03.833
- Well, Mr. Edison
is not solely responsible.

16:03.916 --> 16:05.083
Who else was involved?

16:05.166 --> 16:07.916
- Namely, Lewis Latimer,
a colored inventor.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.041
He created
a better carbon filament.

16:10.125 --> 16:12.875
That's the thing in the bulb
that helps keep the lights on,

16:12.958 --> 16:14.041
so to speak.

16:14.125 --> 16:15.708
- Well, I'm sure
that Mr. Edison

16:15.791 --> 16:17.375
will give Mr. Latimer
his due credit

16:17.458 --> 16:18.750
at the ceremony.

16:21.583 --> 16:24.083
I admire your wit, Miss Scott.

16:24.166 --> 16:27.625
- Joking aside, I can't imagine
seeing an entire building

16:27.708 --> 16:28.833
lit up all at once.

16:28.916 --> 16:31.291
It's both historic
and futuristic

16:31.375 --> 16:32.333
all at the same time.

16:32.416 --> 16:34.833
- Well, you're not going
to have to imagine it,

16:34.916 --> 16:36.833
because we're going to see it.

16:36.916 --> 16:38.333
- We?
- Yes.

16:38.416 --> 16:40.500
We're reporting on it
for the paper.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.541
I need you to help interview
people in the crowd

16:42.625 --> 16:44.916
and get their impressions
as well as your own.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.541
We'll meet here on the night

16:46.625 --> 16:48.750
and travel
to Park Row together.

16:48.833 --> 16:51.208
- I can't believe it.
Thank you.

16:51.291 --> 16:52.958
Well...

16:53.041 --> 16:55.083
I've got to bring you along
to remind Mr. Edison

16:55.166 --> 16:58.000
that a colored man will make
his technology better.

17:01.083 --> 17:02.875
- I'm sorry I couldn't see you
this morning.

17:02.958 --> 17:04.541
I had a thousand things
going on.

17:04.625 --> 17:06.208
- I'm sorry to be
such a nuisance.

17:06.291 --> 17:07.250
Nonsense.

17:07.333 --> 17:10.583
We'll manage for ourselves,
Francis, thank you.

17:10.666 --> 17:12.375
So how can I help?

17:14.125 --> 17:16.000
I'm only the messenger.

17:16.083 --> 17:19.208
- But my aunt is rather anxious.
- Anxious about what?

17:19.291 --> 17:21.166
I don't know how to say it.

17:21.250 --> 17:23.625
Now you're frightening me.

17:23.708 --> 17:26.250
- She asks you
to fire your maid.

17:26.333 --> 17:29.208
- What?
- I think she's called Turner.

17:29.291 --> 17:30.750
Am I to know why?

17:32.041 --> 17:34.291
- She's been seeing a man
well known to my aunt.

17:34.375 --> 17:36.333
- You must have
something more than that.

17:36.416 --> 17:37.541
What man?

17:37.625 --> 17:38.791
His name is not important,

17:38.875 --> 17:40.625
but Mrs. Van Rhijn
strongly believes

17:40.708 --> 17:43.000
that it is an improper liaison.

17:43.083 --> 17:44.708
What proof is there?

17:44.791 --> 17:45.958
- They were
in the street together,

17:46.041 --> 17:47.833
and she laid her hand
on his arm.

17:47.916 --> 17:49.541
- Is every woman
who touches a man's sleeve

17:49.625 --> 17:51.000
in the middle
of an improper affair?

17:51.083 --> 17:53.041
- My aunt believes
that is generally the case

17:53.125 --> 17:55.291
when the couple
are of a very different rank.

17:55.375 --> 17:56.250
I will speak to her,

17:56.333 --> 17:57.583
but I cannot
guarantee anything.

17:57.666 --> 17:59.666
Suppose it was her brother,
or even a cousin.

17:59.750 --> 18:02.250
- We know the man,
and he is not her brother.

18:02.333 --> 18:06.166
But I told my aunt I would need
more evidence to convince you.

18:06.250 --> 18:07.750
Let us move on.

18:09.083 --> 18:10.958
I'm glad you've come.
I want to ask your advice.

18:11.041 --> 18:13.000
- Or perhaps your permission.
- Yes?

18:13.083 --> 18:15.125
- I'm planning a picnic,
and I want to ask Mr. Raikes.

18:15.208 --> 18:17.083
Aurora says she sees him
everywhere these days.

18:17.166 --> 18:18.375
That's if you don't object,
of course.

18:18.458 --> 18:20.041
Why should I object?

18:20.125 --> 18:22.458
- Because I'm afraid
there won't be room for you.

18:22.541 --> 18:23.791
Oh.

18:23.875 --> 18:26.791
- We're going in two carriages,
so each place is at a premium.

18:26.875 --> 18:28.458
A picnic in carriages?

18:28.541 --> 18:30.333
That's a lovely idea.
What fun you'll have.

18:30.416 --> 18:32.458
I'm jealous.
I'd love to be there.

18:32.541 --> 18:34.375
- The trouble is,
we have only eight seats.

18:34.458 --> 18:36.541
I've got Larry, Gladys,
Mr. McAllister,

18:36.625 --> 18:38.000
the Fanes,
and a friend of Aurora's,

18:38.083 --> 18:40.458
which leaves one to fill,
and we need a man to fill it.

18:40.541 --> 18:41.958
Not Mr. Russell?

18:42.041 --> 18:43.833
Mr. Russell is a guest
of Mr. Edison.

18:43.916 --> 18:45.333
- Then Tom Raikes
is the man for you.

18:45.416 --> 18:48.208
- It's so maddening of Aurora
to land me with Miss Bingham.

18:48.291 --> 18:50.666
Otherwise
it could have been you.

18:50.750 --> 18:51.916
More coffee?

18:53.041 --> 18:54.291
<i>It is quite simple.</i>

18:54.375 --> 18:56.583
You will be postilions
when you leave here.

18:56.666 --> 18:59.375
Then when you get to Park Row,
you will step down from the box

18:59.458 --> 19:00.541
and serve the dinner.

19:00.625 --> 19:02.250
- But I don't like horses,
Mr. Church.

19:02.333 --> 19:04.208
- You're a postilion,
not a jockey.

19:04.291 --> 19:05.416
You won't go anywhere near
a horse.

19:05.500 --> 19:06.875
Everything you need
for the dinner

19:06.958 --> 19:08.125
will be packed in a hamper

19:08.208 --> 19:09.458
and strapped
to the luggage rack.

19:10.958 --> 19:12.500
- So she got Mr. McAllister
after all.

19:12.583 --> 19:14.875
- The luncheon she gave him
has worked wonders.

19:14.958 --> 19:18.000
Or do you not care to be
reminded of that, Mr. Church?

19:18.083 --> 19:20.375
- I do not care for insolence,
Miss Turner,

19:20.458 --> 19:22.583
from you or anyone else.

19:22.666 --> 19:25.333
- Mr. Bannister made
such a success of it.

19:25.416 --> 19:27.166
Get back in your cave.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.250
- Pay no attention to her,
Mr. Church.

19:29.333 --> 19:30.250
I don't intend to.

19:30.333 --> 19:31.458
Now come with me,
and I'll show you

19:31.541 --> 19:33.750
where to find
the postilion's livery.

19:34.291 --> 19:36.416
- Why do you take him on
like that?

19:36.500 --> 19:38.500
- He's too big
for his britches.

19:48.875 --> 19:50.708
Mr. Raikes?

19:50.791 --> 19:53.250
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you, Miss Brook.

19:53.333 --> 19:54.875
- But suppose
I hadn't come back?

19:54.958 --> 19:56.583
- I'd have stayed
for an hour or so.

19:56.666 --> 19:58.208
And then I
would have walked home.

19:58.291 --> 19:59.875
Wouldn't be the first time.

19:59.958 --> 20:01.583
And why today particularly?

20:01.666 --> 20:04.125
- Because
I need to see your face

20:04.208 --> 20:05.666
at regular intervals

20:05.750 --> 20:07.208
to keep me
on the straight and narrow.

20:08.458 --> 20:09.666
Any minute now, Aunt Agnes

20:09.750 --> 20:11.000
will look out
the drawing room window,

20:11.083 --> 20:12.500
and I'll never hear
the end of it.

20:15.416 --> 20:16.833
- Don't you think it's time
we stopped worrying

20:16.916 --> 20:17.958
about Aunt Agnes?

20:18.041 --> 20:21.416
I need to see you.
To talk to you.

20:21.500 --> 20:22.958
If you mean it,

20:23.041 --> 20:26.166
Mrs. Chamberlain has offered to
entertain us both at her house.

20:26.250 --> 20:27.833
We could talk there.

20:27.916 --> 20:29.875
- Now I'm encouraged.
- Why?

20:29.958 --> 20:31.958
- Because if you're prepared
to call on Mrs. Chamberlain,

20:32.041 --> 20:34.125
it means you're not afraid
to take risks.

20:34.208 --> 20:35.750
I must go.

20:35.833 --> 20:37.333
I'll send a message.

20:49.083 --> 20:51.625
- I'm going up to change.
Turner will be waiting.

20:51.708 --> 20:53.333
By the way,

20:53.416 --> 20:55.000
Miss Brook called
this afternoon

20:55.083 --> 20:56.708
to ask me to dismiss her.

20:56.791 --> 20:58.500
What?

20:58.583 --> 20:59.666
You're to dismiss Turner?

20:59.750 --> 21:00.833
Wasn't it strange?

21:00.916 --> 21:03.083
Mrs. Van Rhijn thinks
she's been having an affair.

21:03.166 --> 21:04.291
How does she know?

21:04.375 --> 21:06.041
- I think the culprit
must be her son.

21:06.125 --> 21:08.333
I'm not completely sure,
but that's what I suspect.

21:08.416 --> 21:10.583
Oscar van Rhijn?

21:10.666 --> 21:13.708
- I had a letter from him today.
- What did he want?

21:13.791 --> 21:15.125
- Just to lend me
a bit of support.

21:15.208 --> 21:17.500
- Mm.
- So will you?

21:17.583 --> 21:20.458
- Fire Turner?
- Why? Do you think I should?

21:20.541 --> 21:22.750
It's not for me to say.

21:22.833 --> 21:24.750
There must be something here.

21:24.833 --> 21:27.166
- How can anyone believe
you'd make direct contact

21:27.250 --> 21:28.958
with some minor little cog
like Dixon?

21:29.041 --> 21:30.291
It's absurd.

21:30.375 --> 21:32.791
- I do write notes to people
in every department.

21:32.875 --> 21:34.000
They can prove that.

21:34.083 --> 21:35.833
And remember, I'm a rich man,

21:35.916 --> 21:37.208
which means I'm a villain.

21:37.291 --> 21:39.333
Certainly in a jury's eyes,
if it ever gets that far.

21:39.416 --> 21:41.208
- Well, I intend
to pay it no notice.

21:41.291 --> 21:42.541
And I've confirmed
the excursion

21:42.625 --> 21:44.041
to watch Mr. Edison
turn on his lights.

21:44.125 --> 21:46.250
Really? You won't cancel?

21:46.333 --> 21:47.875
I was going to tell him
I can't come.

21:47.958 --> 21:49.708
You'll do no such thing.

21:49.791 --> 21:51.833
We'll face this together,
George.

21:51.916 --> 21:54.625
We'll tell them
how it's going to be.

21:54.708 --> 21:57.083
- If it helps you to believe
we're in control of things.

21:59.416 --> 22:01.916
- Oscar.
- Marian.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.333
- I hope this means
things are better

22:03.416 --> 22:05.333
- between you and your mother.
- A little.

22:05.416 --> 22:06.708
She won't be persuaded
of the truth,

22:06.791 --> 22:08.625
so I've had to agree
to the lie.

22:09.416 --> 22:10.833
Was it you who told her?

22:10.916 --> 22:12.833
No. I didn't know.

22:12.916 --> 22:14.541
But I wouldn't have,
even if I did.

22:14.625 --> 22:16.166
Really?

22:16.250 --> 22:19.458
Well, what will be, will be.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.250
- I'm sorry
about all the upset.

22:22.333 --> 22:24.250
I know it's the last thing
your mother would want.

22:24.333 --> 22:27.583
- Oh, yes, my mother wants me
to have everything.

22:27.666 --> 22:28.833
Except a life.

22:31.333 --> 22:32.791
- I don't believe
I will take any lessons

22:32.875 --> 22:34.583
from Mr. Church, thank you.

22:34.666 --> 22:36.875
- I should teach him a lesson,
if I were you.

22:36.958 --> 22:39.458
- A sharp one.

22:49.791 --> 22:51.583
- You haven't worn this one
for a while.

22:52.916 --> 22:54.375
Turner, I've been thinking,

22:54.458 --> 22:55.500
and I wonder if it isn't time

22:55.583 --> 22:57.458
for us to take a rest
from each other.

22:57.541 --> 22:58.958
What?

22:59.041 --> 23:00.625
- We don't get on
as we used to.

23:02.750 --> 23:05.666
- Like all employers,
you set the tone.

23:05.750 --> 23:07.625
See what I mean?

23:07.708 --> 23:09.291
- Is this Mr. Russell's idea?
Because--

23:09.375 --> 23:11.625
- No, but he's asked me
to give you a good reference,

23:11.708 --> 23:14.000
and despite some misgivings,
I will.

23:14.083 --> 23:16.291
There's no need to imply
your work's not excellent.

23:16.375 --> 23:17.916
- He--

23:18.000 --> 23:19.750
What were you going to say?

23:19.833 --> 23:21.708
Nothing, Madam.

23:21.791 --> 23:22.958
Nothing at all.

23:41.583 --> 23:43.833
- Ask him
when it was delivered.

23:43.916 --> 23:46.000
- When was it delivered,
Bannister?

23:46.083 --> 23:47.375
Just now, ma'am.

23:47.458 --> 23:48.625
Just now.

23:48.708 --> 23:50.750
- Before he goes,
tell him to ask John

23:50.833 --> 23:53.000
for some tips
on serving luncheon.

23:53.083 --> 23:56.000
Everything went so smoothly
when John was at the helm.

23:56.083 --> 23:58.333
- What?
- Thank you, Bannister.

23:58.416 --> 23:59.541
That will be all.

24:02.166 --> 24:03.500
When are you going
to forgive him?

24:03.583 --> 24:05.791
- When he has earned
my forgiveness.

24:07.375 --> 24:08.666
- Did you have a nice time,
dear?

24:08.750 --> 24:09.958
I think so.

24:10.041 --> 24:11.833
I'm always overwhelmed
by Bloomingdale's.

24:11.916 --> 24:13.333
There are more items
in that one store

24:13.416 --> 24:15.000
than there were
in the whole of Doylestown.

24:15.083 --> 24:17.208
- Mrs. Russell
has fired her maid.

24:17.291 --> 24:18.708
- I'm amazed.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.791
She didn't give a hint of it
when I was with her.

24:20.875 --> 24:23.500
- You must have been more
eloquent than you realized.

24:23.583 --> 24:25.250
Will you write to her?

24:25.333 --> 24:26.666
- Of course
I won't write to her.

24:26.750 --> 24:27.750
She might write back.

24:27.833 --> 24:29.750
- You must acknowledge
the letter.

24:29.833 --> 24:31.708
She's done what you asked.

24:31.791 --> 24:33.041
- Is there anything
you'd like me to do

24:33.125 --> 24:34.291
before you get changed?

24:34.375 --> 24:36.666
- Please thank Mrs. Russell
for this note,

24:36.750 --> 24:38.541
but without a trace of warmth.

24:38.625 --> 24:40.500
And have John take it over.

24:58.500 --> 25:00.416
What are you doing here?

25:00.500 --> 25:02.666
Did you have me sacked?

25:02.750 --> 25:03.708
No.

25:03.791 --> 25:05.291
And I got you a good reference.

25:05.375 --> 25:07.083
So I should be grateful?

25:08.333 --> 25:09.458
That's up to you.

25:13.500 --> 25:15.541
- How's the train crash
inquiry?

25:15.625 --> 25:17.083
What do you care?

25:17.166 --> 25:20.416
- I care very much that you
should emerge unscathed.

25:20.500 --> 25:22.458
You see...

25:22.541 --> 25:24.541
you missed something in me.

25:24.625 --> 25:26.708
I was offering you a woman
who would devote her life

25:26.791 --> 25:31.666
to your success, your health,
and your happiness.

25:31.750 --> 25:34.708
Could Mrs. Russell
say the same?

25:34.791 --> 25:35.875
I'd have loved you

25:35.958 --> 25:39.208
to the exclusion
of everything else.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.958
Well...

25:43.041 --> 25:44.916
I'll say good night.

25:50.250 --> 25:51.666
Perhaps we'll meet again.

25:51.750 --> 25:53.458
I doubt it.

26:07.875 --> 26:09.416
Mr. Raikes.

26:09.500 --> 26:11.250
Ah.

26:11.333 --> 26:12.833
This is very kind of you.

26:12.916 --> 26:14.750
I'm delighted to help.

26:14.833 --> 26:17.208
How do you do?
I'm Mrs. Chamberlain.

26:17.291 --> 26:19.583
- I know.
The famous Mrs. Chamberlain.

26:19.666 --> 26:21.875
And I see that your pictures
are quite as fine

26:21.958 --> 26:23.000
as I've been told.

26:23.083 --> 26:24.791
- After luncheon,
I'll show you the gallery.

26:24.875 --> 26:27.708
But now I have business
to attend to.

26:27.791 --> 26:29.291
If you'll excuse me.

26:32.833 --> 26:35.875
- I suppose her business
is to leave us alone.

26:35.958 --> 26:37.750
What would your Aunt Agnes
make of that?

26:37.833 --> 26:41.000
- What would she make of my
being in this house at all?

26:41.083 --> 26:44.166
- Well, I confess,
it feels very daring.

26:44.250 --> 26:46.791
- I gather you're going
to watch Mr. Edison's electrics

26:46.875 --> 26:48.416
on the 4th?

26:48.500 --> 26:50.125
- Will you be
in Mrs. Russell's party?

26:50.208 --> 26:51.625
No.

26:51.708 --> 26:53.291
You're to travel and dine
in two carriages,

26:53.375 --> 26:54.958
- and there's no room.
- Really?

26:55.041 --> 26:57.041
Then why don't I cancel?
You can go in my place.

26:57.125 --> 26:58.458
Thank you, but no.

26:58.541 --> 27:01.291
It would spoil the numbers,
and it's settled now.

27:01.375 --> 27:03.291
- The Fanes are coming.
- Mm-hmm.

27:03.375 --> 27:05.583
- And a friend of Aurora's,
Cissie Bingham.

27:05.666 --> 27:07.500
She must have taken your seat.

27:07.583 --> 27:08.916
I don't remember her.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.750
- She's supposed to be
a niece of Henry Flagler,

27:11.833 --> 27:12.708
the fellow who set up

27:12.791 --> 27:14.291
the Standard Oil Trust
with Rockefeller.

27:14.375 --> 27:16.875
- What do you mean, she's
"supposed" to be his niece?

27:16.958 --> 27:19.041
- Well, no one can work out
how she could be,

27:19.125 --> 27:20.666
but he gives her
a huge allowance,

27:20.750 --> 27:22.541
so there must be a link.

27:22.625 --> 27:24.541
Her mother is most respectable,
at any rate,

27:24.625 --> 27:27.875
whatever the truth of it,
and they both go everywhere.

27:27.958 --> 27:29.333
It's odd how some people

27:29.416 --> 27:31.041
are forgiven
their past misdemeanors,

27:31.125 --> 27:32.291
while others,
like Mrs. Chamberlain,

27:32.375 --> 27:34.166
must pay for them forever.

27:34.583 --> 27:37.708
- The trick is to find your way
into the first group.

27:37.791 --> 27:40.833
- Certainly, you've found
your way around New York.

27:40.916 --> 27:42.958
I envy you.

27:43.041 --> 27:45.208
Never mind that now.

27:45.291 --> 27:47.458
What should I mind?

27:47.541 --> 27:48.875
That I love you.

27:50.375 --> 27:53.458
That my love for you
is the best part of me by far.

27:59.250 --> 28:00.666
You're a good man, Tom.

28:00.750 --> 28:03.583
Think of your kindness to me
when I was a stranger

28:03.666 --> 28:05.375
in desperate straits.

28:05.458 --> 28:08.416
- Isn't it time we took control
of our own lives?

28:08.500 --> 28:10.208
We're young, Marian.

28:10.291 --> 28:11.166
We love each other.

28:11.250 --> 28:13.041
What more do we need to know?

28:13.125 --> 28:15.291
- Otherwise--
- Otherwise what?

28:15.375 --> 28:17.708
- There are so many
distractions in New York.

28:17.791 --> 28:20.500
So many sideshows.

28:20.583 --> 28:22.750
It must be easy for people
to drift down the wrong path,

28:22.833 --> 28:24.250
even when they know
the right one.

28:24.333 --> 28:25.625
Why do you say that?

28:27.291 --> 28:29.833
- I just want us
to be strong enough,

28:29.916 --> 28:32.958
to take hold of our future now,
when we have the chance.

28:35.416 --> 28:38.583
- Excuse me, but shall we have
some luncheon?

28:40.833 --> 28:42.958
- She gave you no warning?
- Nothing.

28:43.041 --> 28:44.750
Out of the blue.

28:44.833 --> 28:47.083
I was helping her to change
for dinner when she said it.

28:47.166 --> 28:49.166
"I think it's time
for us to part."

28:49.250 --> 28:50.875
Had my hands on her neck
at the time.

28:50.958 --> 28:52.083
I wanted to tighten my grip

28:52.166 --> 28:53.250
and squeeze the life
out of her.

28:53.333 --> 28:54.291
I wish you had.

28:54.375 --> 28:56.083
It would have made things
simpler for us both.

28:57.291 --> 28:59.791
- So you're leaving right away?
- I am.

28:59.875 --> 29:02.458
But I may see to Mr. Church
before I go.

29:02.541 --> 29:04.500
He wanted me out
as much as she did.

29:05.708 --> 29:08.250
- Well, I shall miss
your instruction

29:08.333 --> 29:09.791
when I get back in that house.

29:09.875 --> 29:11.916
- Things will be easier
for you soon.

29:12.041 --> 29:15.166
Mrs. Russell is bringing
her daughter out, at last,

29:15.250 --> 29:17.000
so you'll be able to meet her
all over town.

29:17.083 --> 29:18.041
That's good news.

29:18.125 --> 29:20.250
- Go gently,
but get in there fast.

29:20.333 --> 29:22.375
Miss Gladys can be stubborn,
but that can work in your favor

29:22.458 --> 29:24.125
if you can make her think
she loves you.

29:24.208 --> 29:25.666
- They got rid
of Archie Baldwin.

29:25.750 --> 29:27.458
She'll be stronger next time.

29:28.625 --> 29:30.500
- Why does it matter
so much to you?

29:30.583 --> 29:32.708
- Because the she-wolf
is planning something big

29:32.791 --> 29:35.291
for Miss Gladys,
and it would warm my heart

29:35.375 --> 29:37.125
to see her high hopes
shattered.

29:37.208 --> 29:38.125
Ah.

29:38.208 --> 29:39.833
Not much of a compliment
for me.

29:45.375 --> 29:47.416
- This was left for you.
- By whom?

29:47.500 --> 29:49.625
- That lady's maid
from across the street.

29:49.708 --> 29:51.500
- Miss Turner, is it?
- Oh.

29:52.583 --> 29:55.500
Hmm. It seems she's leaving.

29:55.583 --> 29:56.833
- Has she written
to say goodbye?

29:56.916 --> 29:58.041
In a way.

29:58.125 --> 30:00.416
And to tell me
who wrote the letter

30:00.500 --> 30:02.500
which came while you were
serving luncheon

30:02.583 --> 30:04.875
and I was across the road
in Mrs. Russell's house.

30:04.958 --> 30:07.208
- I'm sorry about that.
- Well, you weren't to know.

30:07.291 --> 30:08.875
What will you do about it?

30:08.958 --> 30:10.541
I'm not sure.

30:10.625 --> 30:13.083
I'll have to think about that.

30:13.166 --> 30:17.333
They say revenge is a dish
best served cold.

30:23.250 --> 30:24.708
This is marvelous.

30:24.791 --> 30:28.208
- I'm so pleased.
It's by Monsieur Degas.

30:28.291 --> 30:31.000
He's one of the group
they call the Impressionists.

30:31.083 --> 30:33.208
We were in Paris in 1863

30:33.291 --> 30:35.791
when they mounted
their first exhibition.

30:35.875 --> 30:39.166
It was known as
Le Salon des Refusés.

30:39.250 --> 30:40.291
They'd been turned down

30:40.375 --> 30:43.166
by the Académie des Beaux-Arts,
you see.

30:44.166 --> 30:45.833
It's a favorite of mine.

30:45.916 --> 30:48.541
You have a wonderful eye.

30:48.625 --> 30:51.375
- Before I go,
may I offer a little

30:51.458 --> 30:54.000
of what I've gleaned
from my own experience?

30:55.166 --> 30:56.583
Of course.

30:56.666 --> 30:58.833
- When you're young,
it feels a small thing

30:58.916 --> 31:01.583
to turn your back on society,

31:01.666 --> 31:03.250
but as the years go on,

31:03.333 --> 31:05.708
it can be a lonely place
out there.

31:05.791 --> 31:10.041
Make sure you are
very much in love, as I was,

31:10.125 --> 31:12.708
or there may come a day
when the road you've taken

31:12.791 --> 31:14.625
does not seem worth it.

31:14.708 --> 31:16.750
And now I must leave you.

31:16.833 --> 31:19.333
Please don't go
without coming to find me.

31:25.375 --> 31:26.833
Ever the diplomat.

31:28.208 --> 31:30.041
But our love will be enough.

31:30.125 --> 31:31.458
I know it.

31:31.541 --> 31:34.083
- You sound as if you're trying
to convince yourself.

31:34.166 --> 31:35.833
I am convinced.

31:37.500 --> 31:39.750
The fact remains,

31:39.833 --> 31:42.500
I don't want a quarrel,
and I don't want a scandal.

31:42.583 --> 31:43.750
Not if we can avoid it.

31:43.833 --> 31:44.875
I know you mean your aunts,

31:44.958 --> 31:46.750
but why can't
we just stand up to them?

31:46.833 --> 31:49.291
- It isn't Aunt Ada.
She'll help us if she can.

31:49.375 --> 31:50.666
It's Aunt Agnes.

31:55.875 --> 31:57.958
Do you love me, Marian?

31:58.041 --> 31:59.791
As much as I love you?

32:01.250 --> 32:02.833
That's what I need to know.

32:02.916 --> 32:05.166
What do you think?

32:05.250 --> 32:07.000
Marry me.

32:07.083 --> 32:08.541
Marry me now.

32:24.250 --> 32:26.291
I'll go and find
Mrs. Chamberlain

32:26.375 --> 32:28.000
and say goodbye.

32:30.166 --> 32:34.125
She's a clever
and interesting woman.

32:34.208 --> 32:36.166
Although, I better not let
Mrs. Astor hear me.

32:36.250 --> 32:37.791
Touché.

32:45.083 --> 32:47.208
- I'd like it
a little fuller here.

32:47.291 --> 32:49.625
If madam wishes, of course.

32:49.708 --> 32:52.541
But I should point out that
bustles are getting smaller

32:52.625 --> 32:55.541
- for most people.
- I am not most people.

32:55.625 --> 32:58.208
- Agnes.

32:58.291 --> 33:01.875
If Marian and Mr. Raikes
did come to an arrangement--

33:01.958 --> 33:03.250
What have you heard?

33:03.333 --> 33:05.083
Nothing.

33:05.166 --> 33:08.208
I just meant
that if they did marry,

33:08.291 --> 33:10.583
you wouldn't really cut them,
would you?

33:10.666 --> 33:12.041
Don't you want me to?

33:12.125 --> 33:13.166
No.

33:13.250 --> 33:14.708
Not at all.

33:14.791 --> 33:17.416
- I'd like them
to think I would.

33:17.500 --> 33:20.166
- It wouldn't make
much difference to Marian.

33:20.250 --> 33:22.875
She doesn't care whether
Mrs. Astor receives her.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.750
Maybe not, but he does.

33:24.833 --> 33:27.875
She may think he can give it
all up without a pang,

33:27.958 --> 33:29.250
but I know better.

33:29.333 --> 33:32.083
- Isn't it just possible
you may have misjudged him?

33:32.166 --> 33:33.208
It is just possible

33:33.291 --> 33:35.000
an earthquake
may destroy New York,

33:35.083 --> 33:36.416
but it is not likely.

33:38.041 --> 33:39.166
This isn't right.

33:44.166 --> 33:45.541
Hello.

33:47.583 --> 33:49.041
What can I do for you?

33:49.125 --> 33:51.875
- I knew you were still here,
and I wanted to see you.

33:51.958 --> 33:53.541
Alone.

33:53.625 --> 33:55.250
Goodness.

33:55.333 --> 33:56.583
This sounds serious.

33:56.666 --> 33:57.541
I want to talk some more

33:57.625 --> 33:59.416
about my having
a career in architecture.

33:59.500 --> 34:01.041
Not this again.

34:01.125 --> 34:03.333
You've asked once,
and I've said no.

34:03.416 --> 34:04.791
- So it didn't make
any difference

34:04.875 --> 34:05.916
that Stanford White,

34:06.000 --> 34:07.500
potentially one
of our greatest architects,

34:07.583 --> 34:09.416
thought I might have talent?

34:09.500 --> 34:11.458
- Great Stanford White
turned your head

34:11.541 --> 34:13.625
when he built our house.

34:13.708 --> 34:15.291
I don't entirely blame him.

34:15.375 --> 34:16.708
I blame myself.

34:16.791 --> 34:18.458
I should have been watching.

34:18.541 --> 34:20.125
- What would you
prefer me to do?

34:20.208 --> 34:22.000
- What you're doing now,
of course.

34:22.083 --> 34:24.958
You must study my business
and take it over in time.

34:26.333 --> 34:27.250
What is it?

34:27.333 --> 34:29.250
Father, you're a genius.

34:29.333 --> 34:31.750
You made a fortune
that will go down in legend.

34:31.833 --> 34:32.916
I doubt there are a dozen men

34:33.000 --> 34:34.416
as successful as you
in this country.

34:34.500 --> 34:36.083
I doubt there are a hundred
in the world.

34:36.166 --> 34:37.083
You are very kind.

34:37.166 --> 34:38.291
- What chance
do you think I have

34:38.375 --> 34:40.541
of equaling that
if I follow in your footsteps?

34:40.625 --> 34:41.583
- Well--

34:41.666 --> 34:42.791
- I must always be
the disappointing son

34:42.875 --> 34:44.083
of a great man.

34:44.166 --> 34:46.750
The poor second act.
The failure.

34:46.833 --> 34:50.375
But if I take another path
entirely, like architecture,

34:50.458 --> 34:53.041
I have the chance
to make a mark of my own.

34:53.916 --> 34:55.333
And my companies?

34:55.416 --> 34:57.500
- You'll find and train men
to take them over,

34:57.583 --> 34:59.750
who'll protect my future
and Gladys's

34:59.833 --> 35:02.333
and make sure
the business outlives us all.

35:06.666 --> 35:08.916
You're persuasive.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.833
I'll give you that.

35:10.916 --> 35:13.625
And I promise
to think about it.

35:13.708 --> 35:15.666
But right now I have some
pressing matters of my own

35:15.750 --> 35:17.625
which stop me concentrating
much on anything else.

35:17.708 --> 35:20.125
The train business, I know.

35:20.208 --> 35:23.291
Well, I'll see you
at the house.

35:23.375 --> 35:25.291
And, Father,

35:25.375 --> 35:28.083
I wish you luck, really.

35:28.166 --> 35:30.375
And I wish you luck.

35:30.458 --> 35:31.750
I wish you would.

35:37.625 --> 35:38.750
So she's gone,

35:38.833 --> 35:41.083
and you've lost your spy
in the Russell house.

35:41.166 --> 35:42.875
Yes.

35:42.958 --> 35:44.833
But things will be easier
in the future.

35:44.916 --> 35:47.291
Gladys's mother
is bringing her out,

35:47.375 --> 35:49.000
and after that,
she'll be at plenty of parties

35:49.083 --> 35:50.166
all over town.

35:50.250 --> 35:52.166
- Besides...
- Besides what?

35:52.250 --> 35:54.666
- It won't help with Gladys,
if she hears of it,

35:54.750 --> 35:56.666
but it may play well
when people learn

35:56.750 --> 35:59.666
Turner was sent away
because she and I were lovers.

35:59.750 --> 36:02.083
- A smokescreen
to hide your true nature?

36:02.166 --> 36:04.500
- Don't talk like that.
I hate to be defined.

36:04.583 --> 36:06.666
- And it doesn't matter
that she was a lady's maid?

36:06.750 --> 36:08.208
Don't be such a snob.

36:08.291 --> 36:09.916
The ladies might
take exception,

36:10.000 --> 36:11.750
but their husbands won't.

36:11.833 --> 36:12.875
Did you plan this

36:12.958 --> 36:14.250
when you first took up
with Miss Turner?

36:14.333 --> 36:15.583
No.

36:15.666 --> 36:16.750
But I'm a great believer

36:16.833 --> 36:18.250
in turning
every chance encounter

36:18.333 --> 36:19.916
to my own advantage.

36:27.041 --> 36:29.708
- You saw Mr. Raikes
in the street?

36:29.791 --> 36:31.875
- You know what she means,
Agnes.

36:31.958 --> 36:34.208
Mr. Raikes
is an old friend of Marian's,

36:34.291 --> 36:35.291
and they met by chance.

36:35.375 --> 36:37.458
But was it by chance?

36:37.541 --> 36:39.041
- The point is,
I was pleased to hear

36:39.125 --> 36:40.416
how far he's come
since he arrived,

36:40.500 --> 36:41.875
and I thought you would be too.

36:41.958 --> 36:44.083
Mm, has he come so very far?

36:44.166 --> 36:47.583
- Well, he's friendly
with the Rikers now,

36:47.666 --> 36:48.708
and the Rockwells,

36:48.791 --> 36:50.708
and last week,
he dined with Mrs. Randolph.

36:50.791 --> 36:53.500
- Do all his friends have names
beginning with R?

36:53.583 --> 36:56.125
- I know you think he only
mixes with the new people--

36:56.208 --> 36:57.791
Like Mrs. Russell. Another R.

36:57.875 --> 36:59.333
Exactly, but it isn't true.

36:59.416 --> 37:01.750
You know the Rikers,
and you know Mrs. Randolph.

37:04.666 --> 37:06.250
Aurora Fane loves him.

37:06.333 --> 37:07.458
Aurora has developed

37:07.541 --> 37:10.208
a certain social promiscuity
recently.

37:10.875 --> 37:13.458
- But you're fond of Aurora.
- I'm fond of you.

37:13.541 --> 37:15.125
It doesn't mean
you are without fault.

37:15.208 --> 37:17.500
- You are not being fair,
Aunt Agnes.

37:17.583 --> 37:19.750
- If you are saying I am
not blinded by his looks

37:19.833 --> 37:22.083
and so-called charm,
then you would be right.

37:37.416 --> 37:39.583
Oh, you're going out?

37:39.666 --> 37:42.666
- I was of two minds
about telling you.

37:42.750 --> 37:44.833
Mr. Fortune has asked me
to accompany him

37:44.916 --> 37:46.666
to the turning on
of the lights.

37:46.750 --> 37:48.125
We're both going to write
about it for the Globe.

37:48.208 --> 37:51.541
- I'm so jealous.
- I knew you would be.

37:51.625 --> 37:53.333
I think it's a shame
you're not going

37:53.416 --> 37:55.875
with Mr. Raikes
to Mrs. Russell's party.

37:55.958 --> 37:58.458
- There's no more room
in the carriage.

37:58.541 --> 38:00.291
- She should get
a bigger carriage.

38:07.833 --> 38:09.041
- Your troops
are waiting for you

38:09.125 --> 38:11.250
in the drawing room, my dear.

38:11.333 --> 38:12.291
And I'm leaving too.

38:12.375 --> 38:14.458
- I wish
you were coming with us.

38:14.541 --> 38:16.000
I like your spirit.

38:16.083 --> 38:18.166
We won't be defeated, George.

38:24.791 --> 38:26.750
- Taming electricity
is probably

38:26.833 --> 38:29.500
the most important innovation
of our lifetime.

38:29.583 --> 38:31.166
- And is that something
to celebrate?

38:31.250 --> 38:34.458
- I think so.
I wish I was there.

38:34.541 --> 38:36.375
To see Park Row illuminated?

38:36.458 --> 38:38.291
But with what sort of people?

38:38.375 --> 38:41.000
Ruffians, thieves, and worse.

38:41.083 --> 38:42.833
- Mrs. Russell's
taking a party.

38:42.916 --> 38:44.166
I rest my case.

38:44.250 --> 38:45.958
Miss Scott's going too.

38:46.041 --> 38:47.750
To cover it for her newspaper.

38:47.833 --> 38:49.333
And I will read about it,

38:49.416 --> 38:50.833
like civilized people do.

38:50.916 --> 38:52.916
- I'm sure Miss Scott
will be able to tell us

38:53.000 --> 38:54.041
all we need to know.

38:54.125 --> 38:55.208
- Oh, don't worry.
I wasn't planning to go

38:55.291 --> 38:56.583
without your permission.

38:59.333 --> 39:01.875
- You're very obedient
all of a sudden.

39:01.958 --> 39:04.208
What are you planning
to spring on me?

39:04.291 --> 39:05.208
Now go.

39:05.291 --> 39:06.583
Ring for that
reprobate Bannister

39:06.666 --> 39:07.958
and ask about dinner.

39:08.041 --> 39:10.583
If possible,
I'd like an early night.

39:33.125 --> 39:35.000
Some more champagne, ma'am?

39:35.083 --> 39:36.375
Let me.

39:38.083 --> 39:42.458
- Miss Bingham?
- I shouldn't, but I will.

39:42.541 --> 39:45.333
- That ought to be my motto.

39:45.416 --> 39:47.083
- You must have a very
understanding wife,

39:47.166 --> 39:48.083
Mr. McAllister.

39:48.166 --> 39:50.000
Mrs. Fane watches me
like a hawk.

39:50.083 --> 39:51.666
I do not.

39:51.750 --> 39:53.875
But it seems a shame
that your wife isn't with us.

39:53.958 --> 39:57.166
- Mrs. McAllister
is as happy as a clam

39:57.250 --> 40:00.875
tucked up in Newport listening
to the sounds of the sea.

40:00.958 --> 40:02.166
I've never been to Newport,

40:02.250 --> 40:03.583
but one hears it spoken of
so highly.

40:03.666 --> 40:05.458
My dear Mrs. Russell.

40:05.541 --> 40:07.541
Of course
you must come to Newport.

40:07.625 --> 40:09.416
- I insist.

40:09.500 --> 40:11.083
The town
is just waiting for you

40:11.166 --> 40:13.916
to tear down its defenses
and conquer it.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.416
- Must everything in life
present a challenge?

40:16.500 --> 40:18.625
Everything worth having.

40:18.708 --> 40:20.791
- But surely the point of going
there is to be by the sea.

40:20.875 --> 40:23.375
To feel the wind in your hair
and listen to the waves.

40:23.458 --> 40:24.500
And that's all free.

40:24.583 --> 40:26.625
- Charming
as you make it sound,

40:26.708 --> 40:28.833
I don't think
you have quite captured

40:28.916 --> 40:31.500
- the spirit of Newport.
- Hardly.

40:31.583 --> 40:33.750
You need four outfits a day,
at the minimum,

40:33.833 --> 40:36.333
decent jewels,
and a full dance card.

40:36.416 --> 40:37.333
I see.

40:37.416 --> 40:38.958
- Do you know Newport,
Mr. Raikes?

40:39.041 --> 40:40.333
Not yet.

40:40.416 --> 40:42.000
My mother has a place there,

40:42.083 --> 40:43.666
and we use it a lot
in the season.

40:43.750 --> 40:46.291
- And a very nice place
it is too.

40:46.375 --> 40:47.458
You must let me know

40:47.541 --> 40:49.958
when you're planning to visit,
Mr. Raikes.

40:50.041 --> 40:51.958
- I will, Miss Bingham.
Thank you.

40:52.041 --> 40:53.750
I should make a plan at once.

40:53.833 --> 40:55.166
You won't regret it.

40:55.250 --> 40:56.916
- Then I shall have
to take you up on your offer.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.958
- How is it that we've
never met, Mr. Raikes?

40:59.041 --> 41:01.500
- In a year's time, or less,
most of the cottages...

41:30.875 --> 41:32.125
- Thank you.
You can keep the change.

41:32.208 --> 41:33.166
Thank you.

41:33.250 --> 41:34.500
- How do you feel
about the light?

41:34.583 --> 41:36.500
- Are you excited about it?
- Oh, yes, I certainly am.

41:36.583 --> 41:38.166
- Can I quote you on that?
- Mm-hmm.

41:38.250 --> 41:40.125
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

41:40.208 --> 41:42.791
- Excuse me. I got us snacks.
- Oh?

41:42.875 --> 41:45.291
- For you.
- Thank you.

41:45.375 --> 41:47.291
Look.

41:47.375 --> 41:50.000
- They're assembling now.
- Oh.

41:50.083 --> 41:51.625
Let's get a little closer.

41:53.333 --> 41:55.958
- Some folks I spoke to wonder
how long it will take

41:56.041 --> 41:58.583
for colored people to have
electricity in their homes.

41:58.666 --> 42:00.916
Mostly they're just here
to enjoy the lights, though.

42:02.041 --> 42:03.625
Well, it will be
a marvel to behold,

42:03.708 --> 42:05.041
that much is true.

42:17.458 --> 42:20.375
- Congratulations.
This is quite an achievement.

42:20.458 --> 42:22.333
- This is the age
of achievement, Mr. Russell.

42:22.416 --> 42:23.791
An age when anything
is possible.

42:23.875 --> 42:26.125
- I like that,
and I will remember it.

42:38.208 --> 42:41.291
Ladies and gentlemen,

42:41.375 --> 42:46.291
may I introduce
Mr. Thomas Edison!

43:16.250 --> 43:18.083
Ten!

43:18.166 --> 43:19.833
all: Nine.

43:19.916 --> 43:21.708
Eight.

43:21.791 --> 43:23.458
Seven.

43:23.541 --> 43:25.000
Six.

43:25.083 --> 43:26.708
Five.

43:26.791 --> 43:28.458
Four.

43:28.541 --> 43:29.958
Three.

43:30.041 --> 43:31.125
Two.

43:31.208 --> 43:34.000
One!

44:36.541 --> 44:38.625
So beautiful. Just...

44:41.000 --> 44:45.083
- This is a turning point
in history, Mrs. Russell.

44:45.166 --> 44:48.625
But are we headed
in the right direction?

44:48.708 --> 44:50.875
- We don't have a choice
in the matter, Mr. McAllister.

44:50.958 --> 44:53.083
We must go
where history takes us.
