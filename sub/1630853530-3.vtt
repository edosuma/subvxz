WEBVTT

00:24.441 --> 00:25.609
I'm sorry.

00:36.286 --> 00:39.998
I'm glad we were finally able
to find time for a drink.

00:40.582 --> 00:41.792
Yes, me too.

00:45.379 --> 00:49.800
Although, God,
my panel starts at 7:00 a.m.

00:49.883 --> 00:53.053
"Gravity-assist maneuvers
for multiple planetary flybys."

00:53.136 --> 00:54.555
It's just…

00:55.264 --> 00:58.559
I'm-- I'm looking forward to it.

00:58.642 --> 01:00.811
-It should be interesting.
-Yeah.

01:01.520 --> 01:05.022
Though Dr. Alper does have a tendency to--

01:05.107 --> 01:06.191
Never shut up.

01:06.275 --> 01:07.526
Yes!

01:08.569 --> 01:10.821
Be lucky to get three words in.

01:18.203 --> 01:19.329
See you then.

01:26.295 --> 01:28.213
Without "law and order,"

01:28.297 --> 01:30.799
as your sainted Ronald Reagan
might put it,

01:30.883 --> 01:34.386
the inner solar system will be in chaos
in less than a decade.

01:34.469 --> 01:37.097
We need a template
like the Law of the Sea.

01:37.181 --> 01:40.267
No. Margo, no. Not enough teeth.

01:40.350 --> 01:43.937
We need something-- something compulsory.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.064
Like when Russian tanks rolled on Prague?

01:47.524 --> 01:48.525
Not funny.

01:48.609 --> 01:49.985
It wasn't meant to be.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.070
Nevertheless, point taken.

01:56.950 --> 01:57.993
To be continued.

01:58.076 --> 02:01.788
Yes, yes. Definitely to be continued.

02:03.665 --> 02:06.752
It's true. You could die.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.252
How so?

02:08.336 --> 02:12.216
If the knife scrapes one of its organs,
the chef could kill his customer.

02:12.299 --> 02:15.177
Wow. Death by puffer fish.

02:21.308 --> 02:24.269
Are there many
sushi restaurants in Houston?

02:24.353 --> 02:27.814
Nippon. Always packed,
mostly Japanese people.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.733
That's how you know it's top quality.

02:30.567 --> 02:33.487
An expert in the field of raw fish.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.239
So, you did like it?

02:36.323 --> 02:37.950
I enjoyed the eel.

02:38.575 --> 02:42.996
I don't like it. Too rough.
Scaly, sharp edges.

02:48.043 --> 02:51.004
I'm sorry. Sounds like Leonov.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.475
This is-- This is my floor.

03:04.268 --> 03:05.894
Yes, it is.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.191
Well…

03:17.406 --> 03:18.448
See you tomorrow.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.080
Good night.

04:10.626 --> 04:13.420
Good evening, Dr. Nikulov,
Miss Madison.

04:31.563 --> 04:32.898
Good night.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.694
-Good night.
-Night.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.996
Unless you've been living under a rock,

06:11.079 --> 06:12.706
you've read the news.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.458
Helios has announced

06:14.541 --> 06:18.337
they're going to launch
a mission to Mars in '94.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.339
Please don't say it. Please don't say it.

06:20.422 --> 06:21.423
-Plea--
-And so are we.

06:21.507 --> 06:22.508
She said it.

06:22.591 --> 06:23.759
-Yeah.
-President Hart is determined

06:23.842 --> 06:25.511
we're not gonna come
in second place again,

06:25.594 --> 06:28.055
to Helios, to the Soviets, to anyone.

06:28.138 --> 06:31.892
How are we going to do this in two years?
We were barely on track to launch in '96.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.852
Sojourner 1 can be ready.

06:36.438 --> 06:37.481
And the crew?

06:38.065 --> 06:39.525
I've already got my number one.

06:39.608 --> 06:41.902
We could get the rest of the crew
selected ASAP.

06:41.985 --> 06:43.862
We have some candidates
lined up already.

06:43.946 --> 06:45.781
Not to worry.
No turncoats this time around.

06:46.365 --> 06:47.407
And training?

06:47.491 --> 06:50.202
Not ideal.
We'd have to compress the schedule,

06:50.285 --> 06:52.663
eliminate all
nonessential activities, but--

06:52.746 --> 06:54.581
-It's possible.
-Yeah.

06:54.665 --> 06:56.124
Sorry to point out the obvious here,

06:56.208 --> 06:58.001
but what are they supposed to do
when they get there?

06:58.085 --> 07:01.505
The habs, the fuel generators,
the life support systems,

07:01.588 --> 07:04.800
they're all part of the pre-supply mission
that's slated to launch in the '94 window

07:04.883 --> 07:07.469
so that they'd be there
when the astronauts arrive.

07:07.553 --> 07:09.847
The Mars habs won't even be fabricated
for another year.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.391
So we figure out how to get them
built sooner. Work the problem.

07:12.474 --> 07:14.643
You're asking us
to build the Parthenon in a day.

07:14.726 --> 07:17.855
Well, thankfully we have more resources
than the Greeks did.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.858
Didn't we repurpose Skylab
to build the first Jamestown module?

07:20.941 --> 07:24.278
That's right. We could turn the new
Jamestown modules into the Mars habs.

07:24.361 --> 07:25.904
Those habs are already fabricated.

07:25.988 --> 07:28.365
They're being shipped to the moon
on Sea Dragon next month.

07:28.448 --> 07:31.326
We'd have to adjust the specs,
but it could work.

07:31.410 --> 07:32.953
It's only half a solution.

07:33.036 --> 07:35.330
Even if it works,
we still have to get it there.

07:35.414 --> 07:39.126
Need I remind you, the launch window
to Mars is once every 26 months.

07:39.209 --> 07:40.752
And we just missed the last one.

07:40.836 --> 07:43.088
Our whole mission plan is based on

07:43.172 --> 07:45.549
this stuff getting there
well before the astronauts.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.342
What if we threw out the mission plan?

07:47.426 --> 07:49.678
And send our crew to Mars
without the supplies to survive?

07:49.761 --> 07:51.889
Not to mention the fuel they need
to get back home?

07:51.972 --> 07:55.642
We can launch the pre-supply
outside the window next year…

07:57.936 --> 07:59.229
but towards Venus.

08:01.565 --> 08:04.902
We slingshot it to Mars.

08:05.611 --> 08:07.154
MIT just had a paper on this.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.238
It'll take longer,

08:08.322 --> 08:11.283
but it'll still get to Mars
a few months before the crew does.

08:14.703 --> 08:15.704
It's not the worst idea.

08:16.288 --> 08:17.664
It's a great idea.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.292
And it's what we're gonna do.

08:27.633 --> 08:31.470
We cannot allow Mars
to be exploited by capitalism

08:31.553 --> 08:34.056
but preserved for all the workers
of the world.

08:34.139 --> 08:39.602
This is why the Soviet Union
will be launching in 1994.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.231
That was just yesterday in Moscow

08:42.313 --> 08:46.777
as the Soviet Union joins
what is now a three-way race to Mars.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.237
As you can imagine,

08:48.320 --> 08:50.697
our two presidential candidates had
a lot to say about this

08:50.781 --> 08:51.782
in last night's debate.

08:51.865 --> 08:56.078
If Governor Clinton has forgotten what
it felt like to lose the race to the moon

08:56.161 --> 08:58.914
and would rather just hand Mars over
to the Soviet Union--

08:58.997 --> 09:01.124
You're putting words in my mouth, Senator.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.418
I'm all for a US presence on Mars.

09:03.502 --> 09:06.630
I just question the wisdom
of spending billions of extra dollars

09:06.713 --> 09:08.340
to launch two years earlier

09:08.423 --> 09:11.134
when that money could be used to put food
in the mouths of hungry families.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.388
NASA puts more money into the government
than it takes out.

09:14.471 --> 09:17.891
Governor, you know this has no impact
on food programs.

09:17.975 --> 09:22.437
We have to press forward.
I assure you the Russians and Helios are.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.902
Phoenix 4. EV three has swapped tethers

09:28.986 --> 09:31.905
and reached
the lox tank 4 alpha attach point.

09:32.406 --> 09:33.740
Copy that, EV three.

09:33.824 --> 09:37.119
Proceed with foot restraint installment
with 764 delta.

09:37.911 --> 09:42.165
I see good clearance
between engine two and welding site 7.

09:42.875 --> 09:44.626
Copy that, EV five.

09:44.710 --> 09:48.005
We're going to continue closure
and berth truss element 37

09:48.088 --> 09:49.464
at welding site 7.

09:50.174 --> 09:54.344
EV seven ready for you
to power on DCSU 68.

09:57.681 --> 09:59.057
We've learned a lot from what happened.

09:59.141 --> 10:01.602
Installed triple redundancies
in the thruster systems.

10:01.685 --> 10:05.606
The hotel rooms, they've been converted
to work spaces, crew quarters, storage.

10:05.689 --> 10:08.358
We're replacing two of the large modules
on either side of the ring

10:08.442 --> 10:09.443
with our mobile habs.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.445
-Mobile?
-Oh, yeah.

10:11.528 --> 10:14.156
Once you fly those beasts down
to the surface of Mars,

10:14.239 --> 10:17.409
you'll be able to go to wherever
the best liquid water deposits are.

10:18.202 --> 10:20.746
I gotta say,
that's pretty badass.

10:20.829 --> 10:22.539
I haven't even shown you the best part.

10:49.024 --> 10:50.108
Now we're talking.

10:54.530 --> 11:00.827
You know, we're gonna take great care
of you and your crew, Ed.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.330
Treat you like real human beings.

11:03.872 --> 11:08.836
The days of three people
crammed into a tin can eating cat food,

11:09.670 --> 11:10.921
they're over.

11:11.004 --> 11:15.634
The Phoenix will have gourmet MREs.
We're talking Wolfgang Puck.

11:15.717 --> 11:18.595
All I need to know now is
what do you need from us?

11:19.179 --> 11:21.265
Anybody that you want, Karen can get.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.058
Even if they're at NASA?

11:23.141 --> 11:24.685
You were at NASA.

11:39.658 --> 11:41.910
Oh, that feels good. That feels real good.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.622
Well, judging by the way
you got this flight deck laid out,

11:45.706 --> 11:48.125
I'ma need three pilots,

11:48.208 --> 11:51.211
at least two mechanical engineers,
a navigator.

11:51.295 --> 11:53.714
I need guys that's got some experience
under their belt,

11:53.797 --> 11:55.549
who aren't afraid to take chances.

11:55.632 --> 11:59.303
You know, the truth is,
you're only gonna need one pilot.

12:00.929 --> 12:02.181
You.

12:02.264 --> 12:04.600
The flight control systems are
fully automated,

12:04.683 --> 12:09.813
which leaves more of the 15 crew slots
for scientists, engineers, artists.

12:10.314 --> 12:11.815
-Artists?
-Artists?

12:12.566 --> 12:14.193
It's just an idea.

12:14.276 --> 12:18.238
But imagine a poet being able
to capture the majesty,

12:18.322 --> 12:20.199
the wonder of being
on another planet firsthand.

12:21.158 --> 12:22.159
Hold up.

12:23.160 --> 12:26.413
I'm not putting any poets
on my crew, all right?

12:27.539 --> 12:30.000
And what do you mean,
the systems are fully automated?

12:30.083 --> 12:33.212
In an effort to minimize risk
as much as possible,

12:33.295 --> 12:36.632
the computers will be directing
majority of the ship's operations.

12:36.715 --> 12:39.510
I need to be able to take control
of this ship if necessary.

12:39.593 --> 12:42.304
I'm gonna be 30 million miles
away from Earth

12:42.387 --> 12:44.723
with an eight-minute communications lag.

12:44.806 --> 12:45.891
If a system fails,

12:45.974 --> 12:48.185
I need to be able to improvise
solutions and work-arounds.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.230
I mean,
the survival of my crew depends on it.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.025
He's right.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.250
Hold the work.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.002
I said hold the work!

13:21.468 --> 13:22.469
We made a mistake.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.139
I made a mistake.

13:27.599 --> 13:29.726
We need to rework
the flight control systems

13:29.810 --> 13:30.978
per the commander of this ship…

13:35.232 --> 13:36.233
immediately.

13:46.952 --> 13:49.621
We're coming in hot. Descent rates are up
to ten meters per second.

13:49.705 --> 13:51.331
Continuing descent on manual.

13:57.379 --> 13:58.714
-We should abort.
-I got this.

14:00.215 --> 14:01.258
No, you don't.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.595
-Watch your glide slope. Pull up!
-I-- I am.

14:05.179 --> 14:06.346
I got it.

14:08.140 --> 14:09.766
Throttle up!

14:09.850 --> 14:11.101
Fuck.

14:11.185 --> 14:13.687
UFIT, Sojourner.
You're a smoking hole.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.022
Hold for sim reboot.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.692
You okay?

14:19.651 --> 14:23.363
Sorry. I just-- I got a lot going on.

14:23.864 --> 14:24.990
Like what?

14:26.700 --> 14:28.243
Amber and I just closed on a house.

14:28.327 --> 14:29.745
Look at you.

14:29.828 --> 14:32.998
House, wife.
You know what comes next, don't you?

14:33.081 --> 14:35.501
Yeah. Yeah, she wants one of those too.

14:36.001 --> 14:40.923
Oh, Danny boy
The pipes, the pipes are calling

14:41.798 --> 14:42.799
Very funny.

14:44.259 --> 14:47.304
Tell you what, let's cancel these sims
for the rest of the day.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.430
No. No, I'm good.

14:48.514 --> 14:52.100
No, we've been pushing it real hard.
Go on home.

14:52.184 --> 14:55.938
Maybe pick up some candles on the way,
some bubble bath.

14:56.021 --> 14:57.648
All right. All right.

14:59.775 --> 15:01.235
All right, I'll see you tomorrow.

15:34.476 --> 15:35.727
Knock knock.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.356
Kelly! What a surprise.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.316
Oh, welcome home.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.779
So, how does it feel?

15:45.863 --> 15:49.199
A little weird, to be honest.
Warm, populated.

15:49.283 --> 15:51.159
Yeah, you've been around penguins
for too long.

15:51.243 --> 15:54.288
Fifteen months. Very ice-olating.

15:55.247 --> 15:57.457
Sorry, a little Antarctica humor.

15:57.541 --> 15:59.710
It's what happens when you're stuck
in a small hut for months.

16:00.586 --> 16:01.837
Trust me, I know.

16:01.920 --> 16:04.006
I was stuck in a hut on the moon
with your dad.

16:04.089 --> 16:06.133
You should've gotten
the Nobel Peace Prize for that.

16:06.216 --> 16:07.217
You ain't lying.

16:08.844 --> 16:11.638
-Have you seen him yet?
-No, I came straight from the airport.

16:12.222 --> 16:14.600
Are you and him okay?

16:14.683 --> 16:17.311
Your dad and I have been through
a lot over the years.

16:17.394 --> 16:18.437
We'll be fine.

16:18.520 --> 16:19.771
Well, congratulations.

16:19.855 --> 16:22.107
Pretty cool you're gonna be
the first woman on Mars.

16:22.691 --> 16:25.068
I plan to be the first human on Mars.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.697
Right, that's kind of why I'm here.

16:29.198 --> 16:30.908
Could I talk to you for a second?

16:32.576 --> 16:35.871
Sure. Hey, guys?
Give us the room for a minute, yeah?

16:35.954 --> 16:36.955
Thanks.

16:38.207 --> 16:39.208
Have a seat.

16:47.966 --> 16:50.385
I'd like you to consider
keeping me on your crew.

16:52.054 --> 16:53.514
I assumed you'd be going with Helios.

16:54.306 --> 16:55.974
They've offered me a slot,

16:56.058 --> 16:59.603
but, well, the NASA mission is
more science-focused,

16:59.686 --> 17:01.188
which is my focus.

17:01.271 --> 17:02.648
And I guess if I'm being honest,

17:02.731 --> 17:04.733
I'd like to be on a mission
where I'm not just there

17:04.816 --> 17:07.152
because my father happens to be
the commander.

17:08.403 --> 17:10.071
I know exactly what you mean.

17:10.155 --> 17:12.657
My dad taught me to fly
and never let me forget it.

17:13.659 --> 17:16.578
Listen, if we had room
for more than one biologist,

17:16.662 --> 17:18.163
it would absolutely be you.

17:18.247 --> 17:19.873
But we've only got six seats.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.376
-Who is it?
-Andy Freedman.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.962
His focus on botany will be invaluable.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.714
That's true,
but I think it's shortsighted.

17:28.715 --> 17:29.842
Excuse me?

17:30.884 --> 17:32.219
I like Andy,

17:32.302 --> 17:35.222
but any biologist worth their salt
can grow things.

17:35.764 --> 17:37.724
NASA needs to be thinking bigger.

17:37.808 --> 17:40.352
I've spent the last two years
searching for microbial life

17:40.435 --> 17:42.646
in the most inhospitable environment
on Earth.

17:43.605 --> 17:46.108
We need to be doing
the same thing on Mars.

17:46.692 --> 17:48.443
If NASA doesn't, someone else will.

17:48.944 --> 17:51.530
And they're gonna make one of
the greatest discoveries in history.

17:51.613 --> 17:53.031
Which is?

17:53.115 --> 17:54.491
That we're not alone.

17:54.575 --> 17:58.871
So you're telling me that we're forgetting
the most important person on the crew,

17:58.954 --> 18:00.330
who just so happens to be you?

18:00.414 --> 18:02.165
That's exactly what I'm saying.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.712
I know I haven't been at NASA very long,
and I'm supposed to be patient,

18:07.296 --> 18:09.423
but I am the best person for this job.

18:14.011 --> 18:17.723
How do you think your dad will take it?
You being on my crew?

18:18.432 --> 18:20.100
I can't imagine he'd take it well.

18:20.184 --> 18:21.226
And you still wanna go?

18:22.311 --> 18:23.770
More than anything.

18:30.485 --> 18:32.237
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

18:35.657 --> 18:36.825
So, you used to work here?

18:38.493 --> 18:40.621
Yeah. My first job, sweeping these floors,

18:41.455 --> 18:45.042
back when it was the only Outpost
before it turned into the Hard Rock Café.

18:46.585 --> 18:49.254
Never knew who was gonna show up
and what they were gonna do.

18:50.422 --> 18:54.009
My dad got his ass hauled out of here--
Hell, I can't even count how many times.

18:56.011 --> 18:58.388
-Those are your parents, right?
-Yeah.

18:58.472 --> 19:00.015
Yeah, you look like your dad.

19:00.682 --> 19:01.975
A little cuter though.

19:09.525 --> 19:11.193
Can I buy you another?

19:11.985 --> 19:13.445
Aren't I supposed to be
the one buying drinks?

19:14.071 --> 19:15.280
Equal rights.

19:22.412 --> 19:23.413
You okay?

19:23.497 --> 19:25.582
Yeah. I'm fine.

19:32.256 --> 19:33.257
You wanna get outta here?

19:40.597 --> 19:41.682
Aleida?

19:42.850 --> 19:43.892
Karen Baldwin.

19:44.810 --> 19:45.811
I know.

19:45.894 --> 19:47.229
Do you mind if I join you?

19:48.188 --> 19:49.857
S-sure.

19:49.940 --> 19:51.984
-All right.
-Sorry, let me just…

20:02.870 --> 20:03.954
How can I help you?

20:04.037 --> 20:06.874
First of all, sorry for barging in on you
while you're trying to get work done.

20:06.957 --> 20:08.667
I'm always trying to get work done.

20:09.585 --> 20:11.086
That is what I hear about you.

20:13.046 --> 20:14.631
I'm gonna get right to the point, okay?

20:15.966 --> 20:17.342
We want you at Helios.

20:18.927 --> 20:21.597
Bill Strausser might be lead engineer,

20:22.681 --> 20:25.684
but I know you are the driving force
behind Sojourner 1.

20:26.560 --> 20:30.063
You have risen higher
faster than anyone at NASA.

20:31.106 --> 20:32.900
Other than Margo Madison, of course.

20:35.152 --> 20:39.948
I also know
that your annual salary is $53,000,

20:40.032 --> 20:41.325
which isn't bad,

20:42.242 --> 20:45.662
but considering the hours that you work…
Twelve a day?

20:46.205 --> 20:47.206
Try 18.

20:47.289 --> 20:52.419
Well, that means you make
right around seven dollars an hour,

20:52.503 --> 20:54.713
which is barely above minimum wage.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.757
Menu for you.

20:57.466 --> 21:00.594
Your waitress,
she makes more than you,

21:00.677 --> 21:03.472
and you are a freaking rocket scientist.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.225
Maybe I should ask for tips too.

21:07.809 --> 21:09.269
You're not gonna need to.

21:10.437 --> 21:12.731
We're offering you $100,000 a year.

21:13.815 --> 21:16.652
Plus, full benefits and stock options.

21:17.528 --> 21:20.989
Those alone will be worth
probably five times your salary.

21:22.199 --> 21:24.952
But, you know,
this isn't just about the money.

21:25.035 --> 21:29.206
Helios is different.
I-It's a true collective.

21:29.289 --> 21:31.959
There's no corner offices, no titles,

21:32.042 --> 21:35.671
no government bureaucracy
or decrees from on high.

21:35.754 --> 21:38.048
You can just focus on the work

21:39.466 --> 21:41.218
and not the bullshit.

21:43.220 --> 21:44.888
Yeah. Wow, you're--

21:47.266 --> 21:48.392
You're good at this.

21:50.102 --> 21:53.355
Yeah, okay.
So, does that mean you're in?

21:56.567 --> 22:00.529
I'm not saying it isn't tempting.
I just--

22:00.612 --> 22:03.240
I admire your loyalty to Margo.

22:03.323 --> 22:08.620
It's beautiful, but at a certain point,
you can't live under her shadow anymore.

22:09.371 --> 22:14.001
Otherwise, you're always
just gonna be known as Margo's girl.

22:30.934 --> 22:32.060
Do you know what that is?

22:32.144 --> 22:35.564
Oh, I'm guessing it's a moon rock.

22:35.647 --> 22:38.108
Engineers don't usually make the trip up,

22:39.818 --> 22:41.737
but Margo made it happen for me.

22:42.696 --> 22:45.199
Aleida Rosales,
a kid from Parras de la Fuente,

22:45.282 --> 22:47.409
reached down
and picked up that rock from the moon.

22:48.118 --> 22:51.914
So if I have to be known as
"Margo's girl"…

22:53.999 --> 22:55.751
well, that's a small price to pay.

23:02.132 --> 23:03.425
Thank you for your offer…

23:05.802 --> 23:07.304
but I'm not leaving NASA.

23:10.557 --> 23:11.808
I understand.

23:13.852 --> 23:15.270
Thank you for your time.

23:30.118 --> 23:31.954
What are you smiling at?

23:33.580 --> 23:34.915
Don't wanna wake the neighbors.

23:35.958 --> 23:37.334
We can be quiet.

23:46.927 --> 23:48.136
Do you have protection?

23:48.220 --> 23:51.098
Yeah. Yeah, of course. Just a second.

23:54.184 --> 23:56.436
-Shit.
-What is it?

24:18.500 --> 24:20.294
Come on.
Get out of the pool. Let's go.

24:21.086 --> 24:23.172
Ma'am, you realize
you're trespassing, right?

24:27.801 --> 24:29.887
I thought you said this was your house.

24:38.770 --> 24:41.273
Aren't you too old
to be out skinny-dipping

24:41.356 --> 24:43.025
on someone else's property?

24:43.108 --> 24:44.109
It's my house.

24:45.527 --> 24:46.987
It was, anyway.

24:47.070 --> 24:48.739
Anyway, you're lucky
the guy who lives here now

24:48.822 --> 24:51.241
didn't invoke his right
to blow your goddamn brains out.

24:51.992 --> 24:53.952
Dispatch, warrant check.

24:54.036 --> 24:56.413
-Last name, Stevens, with a "V."
-Can I go?

24:56.496 --> 25:01.710
Middle name, Gordon. G-O-R-D-O-N.
Date of birth, 11/10/1963.

25:02.461 --> 25:06.715
Male,
Daniel Gordon Stevens, 11/10/1963.

25:06.798 --> 25:08.175
Stand by for warrants.

25:09.009 --> 25:10.010
Gordon.

25:10.969 --> 25:13.639
Any relation to Gordon "Gordo" Stevens,
the astronaut?

25:15.390 --> 25:16.808
He was my dad.

25:18.727 --> 25:22.314
Yeah. I guess I see the resemblance.

25:22.397 --> 25:26.276
Man. What they did up there,
your parents are heroes.

25:27.152 --> 25:29.655
You know, your dad was famous
in our department too.

25:29.738 --> 25:32.533
Everybody knew him.
I never pulled him over myself,

25:32.616 --> 25:35.285
but every cop's got a story
about Gordo Stevens.

25:36.453 --> 25:37.538
Good Time Gordo.

25:38.413 --> 25:40.290
No warrants on Stevens.

25:41.959 --> 25:42.960
Roger that.

25:52.052 --> 25:54.388
Today's your lucky day, Danny Stevens.

25:54.471 --> 25:57.266
Angela, get me the number
for Special Services at JSC.

25:58.016 --> 26:02.104
JSC? What-- I'm sorry, what are you doing?

26:02.187 --> 26:05.607
I'm not gonna let Gordo Stevens's kid
sit in jail. Not tonight.

26:06.316 --> 26:09.194
Don't worry. Department has
a protocol set up for stuff like this.

26:09.862 --> 26:11.071
Your secret's safe with us.

26:38.056 --> 26:41.935
I'm sorry, Danielle.
I didn't know they were gonna call you.

26:43.729 --> 26:46.190
There was a pile of beer cans
in the front seat of your car.

26:48.025 --> 26:50.944
I just-- I need to let off some steam.

26:52.070 --> 26:53.155
Training's been really stressful and--

26:53.238 --> 26:54.406
Don't give me that.

26:55.657 --> 26:57.117
What is going on with you?

26:57.701 --> 26:59.995
You were doing so good for so long
and, suddenly, now what?

27:00.078 --> 27:02.164
-You back drinking again?
-Oh, come on.

27:02.247 --> 27:04.249
My dad got in trouble all the time.
No one gave him shit for it.

27:05.125 --> 27:06.585
This ain't the 1960s, honey.

27:06.668 --> 27:08.420
And you done already
gotten away with plenty.

27:08.504 --> 27:11.006
Or did you forget about
what happened eight years ago?

27:11.089 --> 27:13.133
The drinking, the drugs…

27:13.217 --> 27:15.677
I mean, you almost died
in that car accident, Danny.

27:16.887 --> 27:19.473
And a lot of people made
a lot of excuses for you back then.

27:19.556 --> 27:21.517
Do not smoke in here.

27:25.562 --> 27:26.772
Damn it, Danny.

27:28.148 --> 27:29.816
What are you gonna do
if Ed and I aren't around?

27:29.900 --> 27:31.109
I didn't ask for your help.

27:33.320 --> 27:35.030
I'm sorry. It's--

27:38.408 --> 27:42.538
I had a bad night, okay?
It won't happen again, I swear.

27:42.621 --> 27:44.873
You're damn right it won't happen again.

27:44.957 --> 27:48.168
Because you're going to take yourself off
flight status, get yourself back into AA.

27:48.252 --> 27:49.920
No. No, you can't do that.

27:50.003 --> 27:52.339
Mars is the least of your concerns
right now.

27:52.923 --> 27:56.260
That girl in there loves you,
and you love her.

27:56.343 --> 27:57.344
She can help.

27:58.220 --> 28:00.722
In sickness and in health,
that's what marriage is.

28:01.306 --> 28:02.558
Believe me, I know.

28:04.184 --> 28:05.561
Find your peace, Danny.

28:06.645 --> 28:08.146
Mars ain't going nowhere.

28:58.947 --> 29:01.867
Don't you think you should have
at least talked to me

29:01.950 --> 29:03.493
before turning her down?

29:04.786 --> 29:06.288
What's there to talk about?

29:07.372 --> 29:08.457
I love my job.

29:09.708 --> 29:11.502
Yeah, well,
you complain about it every day.

29:12.503 --> 29:14.838
"I work with idiots.
My office is too small."

29:14.922 --> 29:18.842
Yeah, well, I complain about you too.

29:18.926 --> 29:21.303
Doesn't mean I wanna get a divorce.

29:22.262 --> 29:26.308
Come on, baby.
Th-They offered you double your salary.

29:26.391 --> 29:28.101
Do you realize how our lives would change?

29:28.685 --> 29:30.062
Yeah. It's pretty demoralizing,

29:30.145 --> 29:33.899
living in a three-bedroom house,
two cars, running water…

29:34.942 --> 29:37.528
Modern plumbing is not
the mark of success, Aleida.

29:37.611 --> 29:39.321
Well, it is where I come from.

29:39.404 --> 29:40.489
No, don't give me that.

29:40.572 --> 29:45.035
We could afford child care, a housekeeper,
a retirement home for your dad.

29:45.118 --> 29:48.956
Only white people dump their parents off
at old age homes, okay?

29:49.039 --> 29:51.625
-Mexicans, we take care of our families.
-Here we go.

29:51.708 --> 29:54.753
And I'm not letting some
baby-shaking nanny take care of my kid.

29:54.837 --> 29:56.088
So easy for you to say.

29:56.171 --> 29:58.632
You're gone all the time.
I'm the one stuck holding the diaper bag.

29:58.715 --> 30:00.592
Okay. My dad's here too. He helps.

30:00.676 --> 30:03.512
"Helps." Please. He's not helping at all.
He's like having another kid.

30:05.430 --> 30:06.473
That's not fair.

30:11.228 --> 30:16.525
Aleida, he took Javi to the park yesterday
and got lost on the way home.

30:17.234 --> 30:20.654
He-- He leaves the stove on,
like, twice a week.

30:21.655 --> 30:22.948
Now he's starting to get paranoid,

30:23.031 --> 30:25.617
thinking that
the neighbors are stealing from us.

30:27.870 --> 30:29.538
Something's not right, okay?

30:33.876 --> 30:35.460
I haven't seen any of that.

30:36.879 --> 30:37.880
Yeah?

30:39.882 --> 30:41.425
Maybe 'cause you're never here.

31:31.600 --> 31:32.601
Hello.

31:34.811 --> 31:36.021
Oh, hi.

31:37.147 --> 31:39.441
What are you doing home?
I just put the roast in.

31:40.025 --> 31:41.276
Sims ended early.

31:42.903 --> 31:44.363
Fresh peonies.

31:45.405 --> 31:47.908
You know what happened to the crystal bowl
my sister gave us for the wedding?

31:48.700 --> 31:49.701
No idea.

31:49.785 --> 31:53.413
It is gone. So is the vase.
They were very expensive.

31:54.373 --> 31:57.835
-You don't think the movers would've--
-Amber, honey, I need to talk to you.

31:58.544 --> 31:59.795
What is it?

32:00.838 --> 32:02.631
Come here. Sit down.

32:03.549 --> 32:05.467
Danny, what's going on? You're scaring me.

32:05.551 --> 32:07.427
You don't need to be scared. I just--

32:09.221 --> 32:10.848
Well, I need to tell you something,

32:11.598 --> 32:12.891
something that's--

32:16.478 --> 32:18.564
Hey, you know you can tell me anything.

32:20.858 --> 32:21.859
Yeah.

32:23.902 --> 32:24.903
Yeah.

32:31.076 --> 32:32.911
Do you remember my accident at Annapolis?

32:34.079 --> 32:36.582
I was so lost then and now I--

32:38.000 --> 32:41.336
Everything that happened--
It's been really hard and--

32:43.172 --> 32:45.674
You know, I've tried so hard
to keep on the right track.

32:45.757 --> 32:47.384
And--

32:47.467 --> 32:49.678
You've reached the Stevens.
Please leave a message.

32:49.761 --> 32:50.929
I…

32:51.013 --> 32:54.600
Danny, it's Ed Baldwin here.
I-I just heard--

32:55.601 --> 32:56.894
-Hello?
-Oh, hey.

32:58.520 --> 32:59.813
How you holding up, kiddo?

32:59.897 --> 33:01.273
Okay.

33:01.356 --> 33:04.776
I wish it'd gone down differently,
but what can you do?

33:04.860 --> 33:06.778
We're actually just sitting down
for dinner now.

33:06.862 --> 33:09.990
It's a damn shame how they're treating
people at NASA these days.

33:10.574 --> 33:11.575
Yes, sir. It is.

33:11.658 --> 33:14.369
Now, what would you say if I told you

33:14.453 --> 33:17.206
that there was a slot for you
on the Helios mission?

33:17.289 --> 33:19.499
I heard about you losing
your flight status.

33:20.542 --> 33:21.710
Danny, you there?

33:21.793 --> 33:23.921
-Yes, sir.
-Well?

33:24.004 --> 33:27.466
What do you think? Be my wingman?

33:27.549 --> 33:30.719
Baldwin and Stevens,
back in space together.

33:30.802 --> 33:33.222
It'll be just like Apollo 10
with me and your dad.

33:33.305 --> 33:36.141
Although this time, we'd get there first.

33:36.225 --> 33:37.476
What do you say?

33:38.602 --> 33:39.853
I…

33:41.188 --> 33:43.607
I need guys that's got
some experience under their belt,

33:43.690 --> 33:45.275
who aren't afraid to take chances.

33:47.110 --> 33:50.489
Okay. Yeah.

33:52.533 --> 33:53.575
All right. Bye.

33:59.206 --> 34:00.582
Danny, what's going on?

34:02.668 --> 34:03.669
I'm going to Mars.

34:04.503 --> 34:05.963
I know, sweetie.

34:10.801 --> 34:13.554
You are making a mistake, Ed.
He is not in a good place.

34:13.637 --> 34:14.638
Come on, Dani.

34:14.721 --> 34:15.848
By your standards,

34:15.931 --> 34:19.268
half of the Apollo team would have never
gotten off the launchpad, including me.

34:19.851 --> 34:22.145
The kid got a little drunk
and went for a swim.

34:22.228 --> 34:23.522
A little drunk?

34:23.605 --> 34:26.358
Ed, Danny's in AA.
He can't just get a little drunk.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.694
This is just like he was before his crash.

34:28.777 --> 34:31.112
The drinking,
the reckless behavior, the lying.

34:31.196 --> 34:33.114
He's going back down
the wrong road all over again.

34:33.197 --> 34:34.574
He's fine.

34:35.324 --> 34:36.952
You were at his wedding.
You saw what he did.

34:37.034 --> 34:38.495
If it wasn't for Danny Stevens,

34:38.579 --> 34:40.831
neither of us would
even be standing here right now.

34:40.914 --> 34:44.585
Ed, look. I love Danny. We all do.

34:44.668 --> 34:48.505
But sometimes our love can get in the way.
He needs consequences.

34:48.589 --> 34:52.467
No, he needs a purpose, needs a mission.
That's what happened after the accident.

34:52.551 --> 34:55.387
Him going to Annapolis gave him
something to strive for.

34:55.469 --> 34:58.849
I'm telling you, this trip to Mars,
it's gonna be good for him.

34:58.932 --> 35:01.560
Not everything can be cured by a trip
to outer space. You know that, right?

35:01.643 --> 35:02.644
Godspeed, Dani.

35:02.728 --> 35:05.606
I promise we'll leave the light on for you
when we get to Mars.

35:05.689 --> 35:06.899
Ed.

35:10.027 --> 35:13.405
Morning, everyone.
Sorry. Hey, Phil.

35:14.281 --> 35:17.242
I just need a second.
I have an announcement to make.

35:17.910 --> 35:19.703
So, I have hired…

35:21.413 --> 35:23.290
our new MSAM pilot…

35:27.252 --> 35:29.463
NASA's own Danny Stevens.

35:38.722 --> 35:41.391
Yeah. Great.

35:45.687 --> 35:48.565
And I know you wouldn't know this
just looking at me,

35:48.649 --> 35:50.901
but I'm actually quite nervous
in these situations.

35:50.984 --> 35:53.654
So I'm sitting in my hotel room,
in the bathroom,

35:53.737 --> 35:55.656
looking at the mirror and just practicing.

35:55.739 --> 35:59.117
Do I curtsy? Do I back up?
Because there's rules.

35:59.201 --> 36:02.663
You can't turn your back on the queen,

36:02.746 --> 36:06.458
so you have to do
this really strange reverse thing.

36:06.542 --> 36:10.379
You have to sort of inch
your way out of her presence,

36:10.462 --> 36:11.713
which is a very strange phenomenon.

36:11.797 --> 36:13.215
And what do I bring her, right?

36:13.298 --> 36:16.760
What do I bring the woman
who has everything?

36:17.261 --> 36:18.262
So I figured it out.

36:18.345 --> 36:22.558
Are you guys familiar with
that recording artist, MC Hammer?

36:22.641 --> 36:26.520
He's a big guy.
Big, big, huge celebrity.

36:26.603 --> 36:28.188
Thank you. I need that.

36:31.233 --> 36:34.736
I heard about the panel.
I'm sorry I missed it.

36:34.820 --> 36:38.824
I was starting to think maybe you weren't
gonna be able to make it this year.

36:39.449 --> 36:44.037
I apologize. There were complications
I had to deal with.

36:44.121 --> 36:47.791
Like launching to Mars
two years ahead of schedule?

36:48.792 --> 36:49.793
Yes.

36:50.627 --> 36:53.297
But, you know,
I would not miss the IAC for anything.

36:53.380 --> 36:55.382
-I'm just kidding.
-Oh. You have…

36:57.551 --> 37:00.095
You ever been to Mars? Do you wanna go?

37:00.179 --> 37:01.180
Can you believe him?

37:02.181 --> 37:06.059
I mean, you wanna argue
the value of different programs, fine.

37:06.143 --> 37:07.144
But…

37:07.895 --> 37:09.771
the spectacle of the whole thing…

37:09.855 --> 37:12.774
I think this is his specialty, you know?

37:13.275 --> 37:15.194
To our common enemy.

37:19.698 --> 37:21.408
I can't hear you.

37:24.786 --> 37:26.038
Last call.

37:27.164 --> 37:30.167
Last call? I thought this was Europe?

37:31.251 --> 37:33.962
Well, England.

37:34.046 --> 37:35.047
Right.

37:37.090 --> 37:40.177
Well, I could use another drink.
Grab that bottle.

38:14.336 --> 38:16.755
May I use your restroom?

38:17.256 --> 38:20.133
-Of course. It's over there.
-Oh, thank you.

39:16.523 --> 39:18.066
This is a lovely room. I think it is--

39:18.150 --> 39:20.152
I would like you to kiss me.

40:57.040 --> 40:58.250
Are you all right?

40:58.333 --> 41:01.420
Yeah-- Yes, yes.
Yes, of course. I-I am okay.

41:04.298 --> 41:06.175
Because if you don't want to, we don't--

41:06.258 --> 41:08.969
No, no. It's not-- It's-- I-I--

41:12.014 --> 41:13.015
It's just--

41:14.183 --> 41:15.184
Margo…

41:19.938 --> 41:21.064
I'm sorry.

41:22.816 --> 41:23.984
I'm sorry.

41:32.743 --> 41:33.744
It's just…

41:35.746 --> 41:38.165
our nuclear propulsion reactor--

41:39.333 --> 41:42.419
The cooling system is not
functioning properly,

41:42.503 --> 41:43.879
no matter what we try.

41:45.714 --> 41:47.132
You're thinking about work?

41:47.216 --> 41:51.845
I'm sorry. Margo, I'm sorry. Truly.

41:51.929 --> 41:55.807
I know it is-- it is unfair to you.
But, Margo…

41:57.643 --> 42:01.313
You must understand
I have no other options.

42:02.272 --> 42:03.774
If we do not solve it soon,

42:03.857 --> 42:07.236
we will not be able to launch
in '94 and this will be--

42:09.780 --> 42:12.533
This will be unacceptable to my superiors.

42:13.283 --> 42:16.286
God. This was a mistake.

42:16.370 --> 42:20.123
Please, Margo, please.
Just listen. Just listen.

42:20.749 --> 42:25.337
If we are no longer in the race for Mars,
we are no longer relevant.

42:26.171 --> 42:31.760
And if we are no longer relevant,
we are-- we are weak. You know this.

42:32.261 --> 42:33.512
We designed our ship

42:33.595 --> 42:38.016
hoping we would solve all issues
with the nuclear engine before flight.

42:38.100 --> 42:40.936
If I had more time,
I know it could be solved.

42:41.019 --> 42:42.980
But I do not. And…

42:46.233 --> 42:52.406
I need you to give me
your engine design.

42:57.160 --> 43:01.748
You know anything nuclear is
outside the scope of our agreement.

43:01.832 --> 43:02.875
Margo, please.

43:04.543 --> 43:05.961
It is very important.

43:07.713 --> 43:09.298
I am under immense pressure.

43:09.381 --> 43:11.133
I'm sorry. I am.

43:11.216 --> 43:14.636
But when we agreed
to work with each other,

43:14.720 --> 43:16.263
we were also very clear

43:16.346 --> 43:18.765
that it could not be anything
that might have a military use.

43:18.849 --> 43:20.809
-Yes.
-I don't want another Buran.

43:20.893 --> 43:23.187
This is not Buran. This is for Mars.

43:23.270 --> 43:27.191
This is for what we both dreamed of,
together, Margo.

43:28.108 --> 43:29.443
Please?

43:30.611 --> 43:34.198
It will not be for military use.
I promise.

43:34.281 --> 43:36.283
You can't promise me that.

43:37.784 --> 43:39.620
I'm sorry, Sergei.

43:45.292 --> 43:46.543
Yes, I…

43:48.795 --> 43:50.005
I understand.

43:54.468 --> 43:56.053
I understand. And--

43:59.848 --> 44:01.225
And I apologize.

44:04.520 --> 44:07.898
I apologize for everything.

44:19.451 --> 44:20.452
Who is it?

44:26.250 --> 44:27.334
Who is it?

44:45.561 --> 44:46.645
Who is it?

44:57.030 --> 45:00.576
It's good to see you like this.
It's like you're enjoying yourself again.

45:00.659 --> 45:01.785
Well, you too.

45:01.869 --> 45:03.120
There she is.

45:03.704 --> 45:05.831
Come here right now.

45:07.040 --> 45:08.375
I missed you so much.

45:08.458 --> 45:10.294
Let me see you.
Are you still warm-blooded?

45:10.377 --> 45:11.712
Oh, just barely.

45:11.795 --> 45:13.797
You have lost weight.

45:13.881 --> 45:15.799
-Ed, doesn't she feel skinnier?
-Mom.

45:15.883 --> 45:20.095
Yeah, it's 'cause she's been feasting
on canned sardine for the past 15 months.

45:20.179 --> 45:21.555
Diet of champions.

45:21.638 --> 45:23.140
Spaghetti will do the trick.

45:24.183 --> 45:25.225
Thank you.

45:26.059 --> 45:27.227
All right.

45:31.315 --> 45:33.734
Can you guys stop staring at me like that?
It's weirding me out.

45:33.817 --> 45:36.153
What? We haven't seen you
in quite some time.

45:36.737 --> 45:38.113
I know.

45:38.197 --> 45:40.490
I can't remember the last time
the three of us were in the same room

45:40.574 --> 45:41.909
and it was normal.

45:41.992 --> 45:44.870
Well, the night is still young.

45:44.953 --> 45:47.497
Your father's driving me crazy
with crew selection.

45:47.581 --> 45:51.043
Well, at least there's one slot
we definitely agree on. You.

45:52.211 --> 45:54.421
Tomorrow you should come by Helios.
Meet some of the other crew.

45:54.505 --> 45:56.924
We have such a great group of people
from all over the world.

45:57.007 --> 45:58.342
They're dying to meet you, Kel.

45:59.635 --> 46:00.636
Yeah.

46:03.222 --> 46:07.017
No rush. You know, take your time
if you need to settle down first.

46:08.018 --> 46:11.271
No, it's not that.
I don't know how to say this.

46:11.355 --> 46:13.398
Say what? What's going on?

46:13.482 --> 46:15.526
Please tell me
you're not going back to Antarctica.

46:15.609 --> 46:17.444
No, I'm still going to Mars.

46:17.528 --> 46:18.695
Thank God.

46:20.447 --> 46:21.698
But I'm going with NASA.

46:21.782 --> 46:23.242
What?

46:23.325 --> 46:24.993
Danielle just gave me the word
this morning.

46:25.077 --> 46:26.453
I'm on her crew.

46:26.537 --> 46:28.914
Well, yeah. Of course.
We snagged Danny,

46:28.997 --> 46:30.541
and now she's trying
to poach one of ours--

46:30.624 --> 46:33.460
No, I asked Danielle
to put me on the mission.

46:35.295 --> 46:37.172
What? Why?

46:40.008 --> 46:42.052
Dad. I love you.

46:43.345 --> 46:46.849
I love flying with you,
and I love flying because of you.

46:47.850 --> 46:51.186
But I've wanted to be an astronaut
at NASA my whole life.

46:51.770 --> 46:53.730
And just because the time is right
for you to leave

46:53.814 --> 46:55.357
doesn't mean it's right for me.

46:56.108 --> 46:57.442
I need to do this on my own.

47:03.532 --> 47:04.533
Dad.

47:06.243 --> 47:07.286
Ed?

47:11.206 --> 47:12.207
Come here.

47:19.423 --> 47:21.383
Your country's gonna be
real proud of you, kiddo.

47:30.684 --> 47:34.396
-And your parents even prouder.
-Thanks, Mom.

47:35.230 --> 47:36.481
I'm proud of both of you.

47:37.399 --> 47:39.526
I was worried you were going to be mad.

47:39.610 --> 47:42.821
No. The only thing you need to worry about
is me beating your ass to Mars.

47:42.905 --> 47:44.281
That's what you need to worry about.

47:44.364 --> 47:47.159
-Oh, my goodness.
-Okay. Bring it, old man.

48:24.112 --> 48:27.866
Well, I don't care
how many photographs you all took

48:27.950 --> 48:29.826
of me or him or anyone else.

48:29.910 --> 48:32.913
I will not give you our engine design.

48:35.874 --> 48:38.085
You're obviously a very intelligent woman,
Miss Madison.

48:38.168 --> 48:40.963
So I want you
to understand the situation fully.

48:42.589 --> 48:46.218
You have been sharing
classified information with us

48:46.301 --> 48:47.511
for the past nine years.

48:47.594 --> 48:50.389
Anything I told him was in the interest of

48:50.472 --> 48:53.976
the furtherance of space travel
and international peace. Period.

48:54.601 --> 48:57.855
I'm fairly certain
that your FBI won't make that distinction.

48:59.356 --> 49:02.568
I suspect, in fact, that if they were
to learn of your actions,

49:02.651 --> 49:05.863
they would consider you a spy, a traitor.

49:06.613 --> 49:09.575
And you would likely spend
the rest of your life in a prison.

49:10.951 --> 49:13.912
Well, maybe I'm willing
to take that chance.

49:14.663 --> 49:16.623
I will not be blackmailed.

49:17.708 --> 49:19.835
That's very commendable.

49:21.503 --> 49:22.671
I respect this.

49:25.174 --> 49:29.553
You know, the Russians have a long history
of acting out of principle as well.

49:30.304 --> 49:32.681
The man who won the moon for us,

49:32.764 --> 49:37.144
the father of the Soviet space program
himself, Sergei Korolev,

49:38.103 --> 49:42.649
was sent to a gulag in Siberia
for two years because of his principle.

49:43.692 --> 49:46.695
But he was strong. He would not break.

49:48.739 --> 49:52.659
The tragedy, of course, is the price
others pay for such principle.

49:54.620 --> 49:56.121
Those we love.

50:02.836 --> 50:04.296
Stop! Jesus!

50:06.256 --> 50:07.716
Please, stop!

50:11.011 --> 50:12.012
Stop!

50:13.305 --> 50:14.848
Damn it! Stop!

50:16.350 --> 50:17.351
Ple--

50:30.405 --> 50:31.406
Take a day.

50:33.033 --> 50:37.454
And if you so choose,
contact me at this number.

51:30.757 --> 51:31.967
Welcome back.

51:32.050 --> 51:34.595
Thanks. Messages?

51:34.678 --> 51:37.222
Yes. The life systems team
wanted to run you through

51:37.306 --> 51:38.932
the new Mars hab proposal tomorrow.

51:40.017 --> 51:41.018
Good.

51:41.101 --> 51:42.853
And the Secretary of Agriculture
reached out again about--

51:42.936 --> 51:43.937
Next.

51:44.021 --> 51:46.690
Neptune Records called this afternoon.
They have that album you ordered.

51:48.525 --> 51:50.944
Tell them to send it back.

51:51.028 --> 51:53.447
And Mr. Strausser is waiting
for you inside.

51:56.158 --> 51:57.284
Why?

52:21.767 --> 52:23.560
You know, I remember this day.

52:24.478 --> 52:26.730
This was your first day in the trench.

52:27.606 --> 52:31.985
The only woman in a sea of doofuses
in matching white shirts and ties.

52:34.863 --> 52:37.282
And we pulled that stupid prank on you…

52:37.366 --> 52:39.660
Wiener schnitzel and sauerkraut.

52:40.244 --> 52:42.371
Yeah,
we thought we were so clever.

52:43.705 --> 52:45.958
Eva von Braun. Right?

52:47.334 --> 52:48.752
But you, you just set it aside,

52:48.836 --> 52:51.296
and you put your head down
and you got to work.

52:52.256 --> 52:54.675
Speaking of which, I've got--

52:54.758 --> 52:56.468
Right. Sorry.

52:56.552 --> 53:00.764
I just wanted to tell you goodbye
face to face.

53:00.848 --> 53:03.267
I'm taking a job at Helios.

53:03.350 --> 53:04.685
It's nothing personal.

53:05.644 --> 53:07.271
It's just a lot more money.

53:12.860 --> 53:15.696
Okay. Well…

53:17.906 --> 53:19.408
I guess I'll see you around.

53:37.801 --> 53:38.802
Goodbye, Bill.

54:14.213 --> 54:16.715
I can't believe
you're really leaving.

54:16.798 --> 54:19.343
Yeah, I thought I'd be at NASA forever.

54:20.511 --> 54:21.887
You know, lifer.

54:23.430 --> 54:25.516
But when you've been doing
the same thing for 30 years,

54:25.599 --> 54:27.392
it's hard for people
to get excited about you.

54:27.976 --> 54:30.479
I just want to go somewhere
where I'm appreciated.

54:30.562 --> 54:33.774
I'm tired of being the old shoe.
I wanna be the new shoe.

54:34.942 --> 54:37.778
Yeah. Karen Baldwin, when she was
listing off my accomplishments,

54:37.861 --> 54:40.531
she was thrilled
that I was even considering her offer.

54:41.114 --> 54:42.616
You know what she called me?

54:44.243 --> 54:45.244
A "get."

54:46.286 --> 54:47.412
I mean, me.

54:48.288 --> 54:51.959
Bill Strausser. A "get."

54:55.170 --> 54:56.588
I'm not gonna lie, you know.

54:56.672 --> 54:58.173
It felt pretty damn good.

55:02.386 --> 55:04.555
It's not gonna be the same here
without you.

55:06.014 --> 55:07.391
You'll be fine.

55:07.975 --> 55:10.561
You and Margo are like peas in a pod.

55:11.770 --> 55:13.730
The rest of us,
we're just watching from the cheap seats.

55:13.814 --> 55:15.399
Nah, I don't know about that.

55:18.068 --> 55:20.654
You're going to be
a great flight director, Aleida.

55:27.160 --> 55:28.161
Thanks, Peanut.

55:31.790 --> 55:33.208
I'm gonna miss you.

55:34.918 --> 55:36.336
You too, kid.

55:37.838 --> 55:39.756
And go easy on us up there.

55:40.799 --> 55:42.176
Not a chance.

56:10.996 --> 56:12.456
-Good night.
-Good night.

56:46.031 --> 56:48.242
Sojourner 1, this is Houston.

56:49.201 --> 56:52.955
The launch crew wishes you
good luck and Godspeed.

56:53.038 --> 56:55.374
Janice Haan with KOPT News.

56:55.457 --> 56:59.711
Large groups have gathered here at JSC.
Many cheering on NASA,

56:59.795 --> 57:04.383
while others protest their involvement
with the helium-3 renewable energy sector.

57:04.466 --> 57:06.009
In just under ten minutes,

57:06.093 --> 57:09.555
Sojourner 1 will launch
from NASA's Jamestown moon base,

57:09.638 --> 57:13.475
joining Helios and Russia
in a three-way race to Mars.

57:13.559 --> 57:16.645
With the three missions launching
in the same two-week period,

57:16.728 --> 57:18.313
it's an open question.

57:18.397 --> 57:22.234
Who will be the first to complete
the 34-million-mile journey?

57:27.656 --> 57:29.616
Go for Mars Injection Burn.

57:29.700 --> 57:32.786
T-minus ten, nine,

57:33.370 --> 57:36.331
eight, seven, six…

57:36.415 --> 57:37.416
Here we go, kid.

57:37.499 --> 57:39.376
…five, four, three,

57:39.960 --> 57:41.545
two, one.

57:55.350 --> 57:58.729
…five, four, three…

57:59.897 --> 58:01.523
…two, one.

58:39.394 --> 58:40.395
Start.

58:56.119 --> 58:57.704
The president is on line one.

59:00.749 --> 59:02.417
Thank you, Nuri.

59:14.930 --> 59:15.931
Margo.

59:17.140 --> 59:18.475
Madam President.

59:18.559 --> 59:21.937
I know this moment is something we've both
been working towards for a long time.

59:23.188 --> 59:24.398
Congratulations.

59:25.357 --> 59:26.775
You should be very proud.

59:29.278 --> 59:31.488
Now let's kick their asses.
