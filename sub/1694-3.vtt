00:00.894 --> 00:02.061
<i>It's heroine.</i>

00:02.095 --> 00:05.064
You can sniff it, smoke
it, or inject it.

00:05.098 --> 00:07.065
It seems to me you boys ought to extend

00:07.100 --> 00:09.535
a token of goodwill
towards Mr. Masseria.

00:09.568 --> 00:11.002
10% is okay.

00:11.037 --> 00:13.138
If you have a proposal
for helping the women

00:13.172 --> 00:14.573
who come to this hospital,

00:14.607 --> 00:16.174
<i>then I would very much like to hear it.</i>

00:16.209 --> 00:18.910
<i>How do you propose to
persuade Dr. Landau?</i>

00:18.945 --> 00:20.679
You work for me.

00:20.713 --> 00:22.280
<i>Doing what?</i>

00:22.315 --> 00:25.918
My wife and I were going to use
the prize money to buy a house.

00:25.952 --> 00:29.923
This year will be more lucky.

00:29.957 --> 00:32.558
He has the St. Gregory
award from the diocese.

00:32.593 --> 00:33.660
I'll see he's told.

00:33.695 --> 00:35.095
I'd like to introduce Evelyn,

00:35.130 --> 00:37.198
who will be joining us
here at the Artemis Club.

00:37.232 --> 00:41.069
Gentlemen remain gentlemen
only when they must.

00:44.307 --> 00:46.642
I got a gun.

00:46.677 --> 00:50.581
He got a gun. Everybody got guns.

00:50.615 --> 00:53.551
Arnold Rothstein expects
to get what he pays for.

00:53.585 --> 00:55.186
<i>He won't be getting it tonight.</i>

00:55.220 --> 00:58.323
Don't.

01:00.026 --> 01:03.128
Who's calling?

02:53.553 --> 02:55.788
Operator, I'm having
trouble getting through.

02:55.823 --> 02:58.191
<i>Who is the party you're
trying to reach, sir?</i>

02:58.225 --> 03:00.960
Billie Kent, New York City.

03:00.995 --> 03:02.896
I've been trying for hours.

03:02.930 --> 03:04.630
<i>The only thing to worry about</i>

03:04.665 --> 03:07.266
<i>is when you run out of company, sir.</i>

03:07.301 --> 03:10.035
What?

03:12.172 --> 03:14.206
Hungry, slugger?

03:19.646 --> 03:21.880
What the hell is wrong with this phone?

03:24.417 --> 03:27.019
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

03:31.491 --> 03:33.526
No.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.227
No, no, no.

03:35.262 --> 03:37.329
Nucky, wake up.

03:37.364 --> 03:39.698
What time is it?

03:39.733 --> 03:42.602
Mrs. Thompson is on the line.

03:49.776 --> 03:52.945
- Hello?
- It's not my intention to pry.

03:52.979 --> 03:55.581
There's a sentence that
means its opposite.

03:55.615 --> 03:58.518
<i>Father Schuck is here waiting.</i>

03:58.552 --> 03:59.953
Who?

03:59.987 --> 04:01.488
The bishop's man.

04:01.522 --> 04:03.457
We were to review the
plans for tomorrow.

04:03.491 --> 04:06.394
- <i>The St. Gregory award.</i>
- Do it without me.

04:06.428 --> 04:08.930
I'd be happy to oblige, but
you're the one they're knighting.

04:08.964 --> 04:11.766
This whole thing was your idea.

04:11.801 --> 04:13.235
<i>I don't even want to do it.</i>

04:13.269 --> 04:16.238
It's meant to be an honor.
You're not allowed to say no.

04:16.272 --> 04:19.875
There you have it, a shakedown
from start to finish.

04:19.910 --> 04:21.644
You said appearances mattered.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.213
Do you write down everything I say?

04:32.122 --> 04:34.790
- Did miss Kent call?
- She did not.

04:37.560 --> 04:40.629
We must go if you want
to make your meeting.

04:52.940 --> 04:55.842
Is somebody frying something?

04:55.876 --> 04:58.978
Unfortunately, Mr. Thompson
is detained with his work.

04:59.012 --> 05:01.414
He's terribly sorry.

05:01.448 --> 05:03.783
If he didn't work so hard,

05:03.817 --> 05:06.251
he wouldn't have been
able to donate that land.

05:06.286 --> 05:09.321
I can't tell you how much
that meant to the diocese.

05:09.356 --> 05:11.557
It was all his idea.

05:11.591 --> 05:13.692
Truly I can take no credit.

05:13.727 --> 05:15.728
The formalities then.

05:15.762 --> 05:18.097
2:00 sharp, in the foyer,

05:18.131 --> 05:21.000
the invited guests will
already be seated.

05:21.035 --> 05:23.369
You and Mr. Thompson will be ushered

05:23.404 --> 05:25.638
to the front in the
first pew on the aisle.

05:25.672 --> 05:27.640
After my brief dedication,

05:27.675 --> 05:30.376
Bishop Norman will present
Mr. Thompson with the award.

05:30.444 --> 05:33.113
I'm noticing a private
audience with the bishop

05:33.147 --> 05:35.648
has not been scheduled as I'd requested.

05:35.683 --> 05:38.952
Yes, I'm afraid the bishop's
schedule is rather tight.

05:38.986 --> 05:41.621
I see.

05:41.655 --> 05:44.224
Though, as you mentioned,
it's a great honor

05:44.258 --> 05:46.192
for Mr. Thompson to receive the award

05:46.227 --> 05:49.929
for his selfless
generosity to the diocese.

05:49.964 --> 05:52.432
To not have a moment
with the bishop would be

05:52.466 --> 05:54.501
such a disappointment.

05:54.536 --> 05:57.171
Unfortunately, there just
won't be an opportunity.

05:58.507 --> 06:01.575
One might almost think he
was trying to avoid us.

06:01.609 --> 06:03.410
I assure you, that's not the case.

06:03.444 --> 06:05.412
Then you'll see to it?

06:05.446 --> 06:08.114
Or shall I call his private secretary

06:08.149 --> 06:10.616
to relieve you of the bother?

06:13.687 --> 06:16.021
I am sure something can be arranged.

06:41.749 --> 06:43.449
Ahem.

06:57.531 --> 07:00.300
You g.d. bunch of...

07:02.103 --> 07:05.106
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

07:05.140 --> 07:07.007
Do you know what haunts me

07:07.042 --> 07:09.744
when I lay my head down at night?

07:09.778 --> 07:12.781
What dogs me when I open
my eyes in the morning?

07:12.815 --> 07:14.316
The curse of halitosis, Scotty?

07:14.350 --> 07:16.151
Wrinkles, my friend.

07:16.185 --> 07:18.587
The world is plagued by wrinkles.

07:18.621 --> 07:21.189
On summer frocks and Sunday suits.

07:21.223 --> 07:23.091
Pinafores and pocket squares.

07:23.125 --> 07:25.761
Who's the man in the arrow shirt
when you cover him with creases?

07:25.795 --> 07:28.430
- Nothing but a dub.
- Gloria Swanson's home alone

07:28.464 --> 07:31.433
on Saturday night with
nothing fresh to wear.

07:31.468 --> 07:33.035
You got her number? I'll chat her up.

07:33.069 --> 07:36.338
We don't sell irons here
at Farraday, friends.

07:36.372 --> 07:38.840
We sell confidence and opportunity.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.942
The big contract signed,

07:40.977 --> 07:43.111
the ring on a sweetheart's finger,

07:43.146 --> 07:45.447
and dreams that always come true.

07:45.481 --> 07:47.482
- Who's ready to spread the gospel?
- Bosco.

07:47.517 --> 07:48.750
- Hunka.
- Not any.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.656
Make the world smooth for me.

07:57.561 --> 07:59.695
George,

07:59.729 --> 08:03.031
didn't mama ever tell you
about the early bird?

08:04.400 --> 08:07.635
I'm experiencing a
mishap with a strap.

08:11.173 --> 08:13.974
I got to say, you're a pip and a half.

08:29.557 --> 08:33.027
Nucky. Welcome to tabor heights.

08:42.171 --> 08:45.307
Police escort and everything.

08:45.341 --> 08:47.109
What do you want, Gyp?

08:47.143 --> 08:50.279
I was thinking maybe the pot roast.
How about you?

08:50.314 --> 08:52.749
I didn't come up here for
your vaudeville routine.

08:52.783 --> 08:54.851
Well, Bible camp ain't till summer,

08:54.885 --> 08:57.320
so why did you come?

08:59.357 --> 09:02.660
Obviously I offended you in some way.

09:02.694 --> 09:05.096
But since you're a man
who can find an insult

09:05.130 --> 09:07.898
in a bouquet of roses,
I'm not sure quite how.

09:07.933 --> 09:10.668
Maybe it's got something to do with
you jeopardizing my livelihood.

09:10.702 --> 09:13.270
It's a free market. I
sell to whom I choose.

09:13.305 --> 09:15.739
To <i>whom?</i> Listen to you.

09:15.774 --> 09:17.841
- I wish you'd start.
- I got customers.

09:17.876 --> 09:19.877
20-block stretch in the Lower West Side.

09:19.911 --> 09:22.746
They can't buy from me,
they buy someplace else.

09:22.781 --> 09:24.415
I'm not selling to Yale or Remus either,

09:24.449 --> 09:26.984
and you don't see them acting
like petulant children.

09:27.018 --> 09:28.419
Right, you only sell to the Jew.

09:28.453 --> 09:30.620
I told you, I need to
keep things simple.

09:30.655 --> 09:33.724
<i>Like this place. Simple.</i>

09:33.758 --> 09:37.127
Only one road, one road out.

09:37.161 --> 09:39.563
<i>Atlantic City to New York.</i>

09:39.597 --> 09:42.298
I'll use the back roads through
the pine barrens, Gyp.

09:42.333 --> 09:43.773
<i>I don't know where the fuck that is,</i>

09:43.801 --> 09:46.535
but I bet it's one hell of a slog.

09:46.570 --> 09:50.406
And if I was you, every
inch of that road

09:50.440 --> 09:51.940
would stick in my craw.

09:51.974 --> 09:53.475
But I'm not you, Gyp.

09:53.509 --> 09:57.011
I learned a long time ago not
to take things personally.

09:57.046 --> 09:58.746
Everyone's a person, though, right?

09:58.781 --> 10:00.415
So how else could they take it?

10:04.353 --> 10:06.521
In the interest of honoring

10:06.556 --> 10:09.792
what was once a fruitful
business relationship,

10:09.826 --> 10:12.395
let's set the table over again.

10:12.429 --> 10:15.031
<i>You'll be my guest in
Atlantic City tonight.</i>

10:15.065 --> 10:17.767
I'll send you home tomorrow
with a full month's supply.

10:17.801 --> 10:20.202
<i>You keep your head above
water in New York</i>

10:20.237 --> 10:22.171
and leave these nice people alone.

10:22.205 --> 10:24.706
You'll stay a lot healthier that way.

10:26.742 --> 10:28.343
What happens after a month?

10:28.377 --> 10:30.611
I don't consider that my problem.

10:33.882 --> 10:35.349
Square enough deal.

10:44.792 --> 10:47.993
Then this is where you shake my hand.

11:01.607 --> 11:03.742
<i>It's not just the bathroom.</i>

11:03.776 --> 11:05.978
The entire top floor leaks.

11:06.012 --> 11:09.348
I've got buckets catching rainwater
in three separate bedrooms.

11:09.382 --> 11:13.085
Fuck the ceiling. It's when the cooze
starts leaking you got real problems.

11:14.587 --> 11:17.355
The larger point, Charles, is
that you're a partner here.

11:17.390 --> 11:19.357
<i>The house needs to be maintained.</i>

11:19.392 --> 11:21.552
I just dropped a grand to
fixing up your sitting room.

11:21.560 --> 11:24.395
And there are 18 others
that still need attention.

11:24.430 --> 11:27.064
It's a whorehouse, not the Taj Mahal.

11:27.099 --> 11:30.334
Your name ain't even on the deed.
It belongs to Jimmy.

11:30.368 --> 11:32.936
And he'll sign it over as
soon as he comes home.

11:32.970 --> 11:35.839
Just knock off the
screwball shit, will you?

11:35.873 --> 11:38.241
- Meaning what, exactly?
- <i>I ain't got time, sweetie.</i>

11:38.275 --> 11:40.711
Just start showing me a
return on my investment.

11:47.085 --> 11:48.685
What's the story, meyer?

11:48.719 --> 11:50.954
There's 96 packets total,

11:50.988 --> 11:53.423
<i>so you know for later.</i>

11:53.457 --> 11:56.092
Put it on. Gently.

11:59.397 --> 12:00.798
It feels lumpy.

12:00.832 --> 12:02.992
That's how your head's gonna
feel if you fuck this up.

12:02.993 --> 12:05.269
- <i>Farshtay?</i>
- He understands, Charlie.

12:05.304 --> 12:06.704
Let me hear it from him.

12:08.373 --> 12:11.643
Cab to 104 and Lex, third
floor, apartment D.

12:11.677 --> 12:13.779
Drop off the decks, take the dough.

12:13.813 --> 12:15.814
- Same as always.
- Cash first, Benny.

12:15.848 --> 12:16.982
Count it there.

12:17.016 --> 12:19.351
Penny less than the
whole geetus, you walk.

12:19.385 --> 12:21.219
They have some complaint
about the product...

12:21.254 --> 12:23.455
- You walk.
- You don't like the look of anyone...

12:25.758 --> 12:27.326
What the fuck are you doing?

12:27.360 --> 12:30.029
- Protecting the deal.
- Put that away.

12:30.063 --> 12:31.764
I'm wearing a pound of heroin.

12:31.798 --> 12:33.198
You walk.

12:36.436 --> 12:37.937
I need cab fare.

12:45.512 --> 12:48.680
You bring back the change,
we go out for chinks.

12:52.652 --> 12:54.720
And don't yank on the
lining of the coat.

12:54.754 --> 12:57.556
It looks suspicious.

13:00.659 --> 13:02.227
- He'll be fine.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

13:02.261 --> 13:05.496
- Or he'll kill six people.
- Him I'm not worried about.

13:05.531 --> 13:07.932
It's Masseria we need to settle with.

13:07.966 --> 13:10.467
Hock me with his again?

13:10.502 --> 13:13.103
He's gonna come looking for his piece.

13:15.539 --> 13:17.940
We're sending Benny up to Harlem.

13:17.975 --> 13:19.876
We're dealing in midtown.

13:19.910 --> 13:21.811
Feelers into Jersey.

13:21.845 --> 13:24.013
I sell two bindles of
powder on Elizabeth street,

13:24.048 --> 13:26.449
- Joe Masseria gets cut in?
- That's how he'll see it.

13:26.484 --> 13:28.251
We just roll over

13:28.286 --> 13:30.987
when it's our thing, not his?

13:31.022 --> 13:33.790
We approach him. We make the terms.

13:33.825 --> 13:36.326
We look like gentlemen.

13:36.394 --> 13:38.429
Ever eat with that prick?

13:38.463 --> 13:40.965
He has his dinner and then he has yours.

13:42.334 --> 13:44.636
I'm saying for now, Charlie.

13:44.670 --> 13:46.805
Just for now.

14:02.690 --> 14:05.358
- Dr. Landau.
- Mrs. Thompson.

14:05.393 --> 14:07.794
What a wonderful surprise.

14:07.828 --> 14:09.329
Have you met Dr. Mason?

14:09.363 --> 14:11.297
I have, actually.

14:11.332 --> 14:13.734
Nice to see you again.

14:16.805 --> 14:19.773
- I have my rounds.
- Of course.

14:19.808 --> 14:22.209
I wanted to offer my congratulations

14:22.244 --> 14:24.111
on your husband's well-deserved honor.

14:24.145 --> 14:26.647
I'm hoping you'll be there

14:26.681 --> 14:28.082
to congratulate him in person.

14:28.116 --> 14:30.451
Of course. That's very
kind of you to invite us.

14:30.485 --> 14:33.187
I'm glad there are no hard feelings.

14:33.221 --> 14:34.655
What do you mean?

14:34.689 --> 14:37.358
Well, our little
contretemps at your party.

14:37.392 --> 14:40.394
Your idea about prenatal instruction.

14:40.429 --> 14:42.363
It's quite long forgotten.

14:42.397 --> 14:44.265
On to more important matters.

14:44.299 --> 14:46.001
How are we doing on the landscaping?

14:46.069 --> 14:48.738
Just on my way to see Mr. McCaully.

14:48.772 --> 14:51.492
You'll be glad to hear we've ordered
the hydrangeas you recommended.

14:51.493 --> 14:53.277
That's wonderful.

14:53.311 --> 14:56.046
Flowers make everyone cheery.

15:08.593 --> 15:11.028
- You're short, Elmer.
- How do you mean?

15:11.062 --> 15:13.331
The money, you fucking hayseed.

15:13.365 --> 15:17.334
80 cases, $4,800.

15:17.369 --> 15:19.270
Hang on, Mick.

15:19.338 --> 15:20.939
That don't add up.

15:20.973 --> 15:24.877
80 cases at $50 apiece is 4,000.

15:24.944 --> 15:27.680
It don't add up 'cause it's 60 a case.

15:27.714 --> 15:29.849
That ain't the deal I
cut with Manny Horvitz.

15:29.883 --> 15:31.751
Well, why don't you take it up with him?

15:31.785 --> 15:33.352
Well, he's dead, ain't he?

15:33.387 --> 15:35.822
That's right.

15:35.856 --> 15:38.057
And how do you think he got that way?

15:38.092 --> 15:40.993
By arguing with me.

15:42.663 --> 15:44.930
Check my figures.

15:44.965 --> 15:46.465
Add 'em up again.

15:46.499 --> 15:48.899
Then your wife can count how
many slugs I put in your skull.

15:48.900 --> 15:51.703
All right, Mick. Relax.

15:58.977 --> 16:01.045
That's better.

16:01.080 --> 16:03.648
Now go milk a cow.

16:05.451 --> 16:07.486
What the fuck are you
looking at, peckerhead?

16:07.520 --> 16:09.754
Me? Nothing.

16:11.190 --> 16:13.792
Get that whiskey over
to Gillian Darmody's.

16:15.161 --> 16:17.495
And don't try and weasel
a handjob for a tip.

16:48.755 --> 16:50.595
<i>You all remember Jimmy Darmody.</i>

16:50.629 --> 16:52.263
- <i>Welcome back.</i>
- <i>Welcome home, Jimmy.</i>

16:52.297 --> 16:55.066
- <i>Welcome back, kid.</i>
- <i>Gave them huns hell, I heard.</i>

16:55.100 --> 16:56.834
Sure did.

16:56.868 --> 16:59.637
Well, now that he's made the
world safe for democracy,

16:59.671 --> 17:01.806
he's back to lend us a hand, too.

17:01.840 --> 17:04.175
In three weeks, Paddy
Ryan is taking over

17:04.209 --> 17:05.910
<i>as chief clerk of the 4th ward.</i>

17:05.944 --> 17:07.712
Jimmy here will be pat's man Friday.

17:07.746 --> 17:11.148
- <i>Attaboy!</i>
- <i>Congratulations, Paddy.</i>

17:11.183 --> 17:13.017
<i>He's here.</i>

17:13.051 --> 17:15.686
Gyp Rosetti.

17:18.390 --> 17:19.757
Sleeping on the job?

17:19.790 --> 17:22.059
Reminiscing, I guess.

17:22.094 --> 17:24.028
The old days.

17:24.063 --> 17:26.797
Sharp suit,

17:26.832 --> 17:30.101
private supper at the
best joint in town...

17:31.203 --> 17:33.571
I'll bet the new days are better.

17:33.605 --> 17:35.240
Land of opportunity.

17:35.274 --> 17:37.041
Yeah.

17:37.076 --> 17:39.210
Sperlinga,

17:39.244 --> 17:41.145
where I'm from,

17:41.180 --> 17:44.416
we lived in a cave.

17:46.285 --> 17:50.488
Little hut carved right
into the Mountain.

17:50.522 --> 17:53.924
I didn't grow up in a cave,

17:53.958 --> 17:56.693
but I know what it's like

17:56.728 --> 17:59.029
to end up very far from
where you started.

17:59.063 --> 18:00.130
Thought you was from here.

18:00.165 --> 18:03.400
Born and bred. But nonetheless.

18:06.838 --> 18:09.006
No.

18:09.040 --> 18:11.809
<i>All nostra buon fortuna.</i>

18:11.843 --> 18:13.277
What's that mean?

18:13.344 --> 18:15.045
To our good luck.

18:17.015 --> 18:18.916
We both deserve it.

18:22.454 --> 18:25.424
Gentlemen, are we ready to order?

18:25.458 --> 18:28.928
Well, I wouldn't mind a slice of you.

18:28.962 --> 18:32.064
I'm much too tough, sweetie.
You'd crack a tooth.

18:32.099 --> 18:35.068
Just send over whatever is
good and keep it coming.

18:39.673 --> 18:41.840
Hot to trot?

18:41.875 --> 18:43.642
Can you blame me?

18:43.677 --> 18:45.577
I haven't seen my wife in days.

18:45.611 --> 18:47.779
I mean, it builds up. Not healthy.

18:47.813 --> 18:50.014
Atlantic City offers many alternatives.

18:50.048 --> 18:53.617
Tops in my book, Gillian
Darmody's joint.

18:55.386 --> 18:56.686
I've never been.

18:56.721 --> 18:58.488
<i>You know her, though, right?</i>

18:58.522 --> 18:59.655
It's a small town.

18:59.690 --> 19:01.691
What, you and her?

19:03.394 --> 19:05.561
Don't shit me. Small town.

19:05.596 --> 19:07.297
No, we just go back a while.

19:07.331 --> 19:09.533
Tell you what. Come with me.

19:09.567 --> 19:11.034
My guest.

19:12.903 --> 19:14.337
Another time, maybe.

19:14.371 --> 19:15.738
I'm going home tomorrow.

19:15.773 --> 19:17.413
When I'm in your neck
of the woods, then.

19:19.276 --> 19:22.178
Not that I'm implying
you live among trees.

19:24.281 --> 19:26.650
Like a monkey or something?

19:28.019 --> 19:30.520
Are we starting with this now?

19:49.108 --> 19:51.176
Money first. Remember.

19:51.210 --> 19:53.412
I know. Same as last night.

19:53.446 --> 19:55.248
Drop off the decks. Quit riding me.

19:55.282 --> 19:58.618
It's a business, Benny.
Plain and simple.

19:58.652 --> 20:01.587
Right. Right, right, right.

20:06.826 --> 20:08.660
Hey, kid.

20:08.695 --> 20:11.430
Is this the right block
for the turkish bath?

20:11.464 --> 20:13.265
How big a putz you think I am?

20:13.299 --> 20:15.533
How big they make 'em?

20:15.568 --> 20:18.336
Joe Masseria says hello.

20:23.108 --> 20:24.676
Hey!

20:32.785 --> 20:35.753
I'll fucking kill you fucks!

20:35.787 --> 20:38.156
Benny, get down.

20:38.190 --> 20:39.591
Benny, come on,

20:39.625 --> 20:41.726
what are you, fucking nuts? Come on.

20:41.761 --> 20:43.662
You're dead! You hear me?!

20:43.696 --> 20:46.164
You're dead! I'll fucking kill you!

20:46.199 --> 20:48.333
I'll fucking kill you!

21:12.761 --> 21:15.063
He's having the teeth.

21:17.233 --> 21:19.568
I was awake anyway.

21:20.971 --> 21:23.839
I am soaking your shirt in lemon juice.

21:23.873 --> 21:26.408
The ink will come out for tomorrow.

21:28.811 --> 21:30.913
I'll be more careful.

21:31.948 --> 21:34.649
But you must buy a new one.

21:34.684 --> 21:38.587
When the customer opens the door,

21:38.621 --> 21:40.389
what is she to see?

21:42.191 --> 21:45.059
Confidence and opportunity.

21:45.094 --> 21:48.363
That is what you must
carry in your case.

21:55.939 --> 21:59.408
You must also share your
troubles with your wife.

21:59.442 --> 22:03.011
It's nothing. Slight headache.

22:06.149 --> 22:08.150
From the work I think, yes?

22:09.151 --> 22:11.319
Sales are slow.

22:11.353 --> 22:14.355
You must smile.

22:15.723 --> 22:18.392
You are charming when you smile.

22:19.260 --> 22:21.095
Show me.

22:26.969 --> 22:28.936
Close your eyes.

22:33.409 --> 22:36.144
Now you must think of something

22:36.179 --> 22:39.514
that makes you so happy.

22:49.292 --> 22:51.260
There it is.

22:52.195 --> 22:54.563
I see it now.

23:08.444 --> 23:12.415
You are the handsome
salesman number one.

23:14.284 --> 23:16.886
I think I open the door...

23:19.556 --> 23:21.190
And let you in.

23:29.032 --> 23:31.567
Sell to me.

23:48.750 --> 23:50.752
So I'll see you over at Mickey's.

23:50.786 --> 23:53.988
- Beg pardon?
- Tomorrow.

23:54.022 --> 23:55.590
When I pick up my shipment.

23:55.624 --> 23:58.226
Indeed you will.

23:58.260 --> 23:59.961
Look at her.

23:59.996 --> 24:01.996
<i>That red hair, huh?</i>

24:02.031 --> 24:04.532
<i>It gives me an ache.</i>

24:04.567 --> 24:06.969
I'm serious. Right here.

24:10.774 --> 24:13.709
So, look, I'm glad we settled this.

24:13.744 --> 24:15.712
- I am, too.
- Seriously.

24:15.746 --> 24:17.380
I get all wrapped up in a thing.

24:17.415 --> 24:20.584
I mean, my head starts pounding,
I can't even think straight.

24:20.618 --> 24:23.120
I need to remind myself

24:23.154 --> 24:24.688
life's better with friends.

24:24.722 --> 24:27.124
No one's going to argue with that.

24:34.666 --> 24:37.000
Mr. Rosetti.

24:39.103 --> 24:41.338
Good to see you.

25:12.100 --> 25:14.802
- My associate Tonino.
- Look at you.

25:16.471 --> 25:19.840
- You like working here?
- Sure.

25:19.907 --> 25:23.744
Ever get to, you know, with the girls?

25:26.047 --> 25:27.948
No, not really.

25:27.982 --> 25:30.584
Even still, it beats the
pants off of my job.

25:30.618 --> 25:33.287
I'd walk around with a stiffy all day.

25:33.321 --> 25:36.023
Mmm.

25:37.225 --> 25:39.160
Can you keep a secret?

25:41.563 --> 25:43.330
Manny Horvitz.

25:44.699 --> 25:47.000
I heard his luck run out.

25:47.035 --> 25:49.603
His ran out and Mickey Doyle's ran in.

25:52.540 --> 25:53.873
What do you mean?

25:53.908 --> 25:55.675
It was Mickey shot Manny.

25:56.844 --> 25:59.212
Where did you hear that?

25:59.246 --> 26:01.214
From Mickey himself.

26:01.249 --> 26:03.617
You know, he may seem dopey,

26:03.651 --> 26:05.886
but I sure wouldn't mess with that guy.

26:28.342 --> 26:30.510
<i>Hello?</i>

26:33.714 --> 26:36.249
It's just me.

26:39.554 --> 26:41.655
So you'll be staying here tonight?

26:43.791 --> 26:46.827
I thought we'd all head to the
church tomorrow together.

26:49.897 --> 26:52.165
Very well.

26:54.135 --> 26:57.270
I've been having trouble sleeping.

27:02.944 --> 27:05.345
Some warm milk, perhaps.

27:20.428 --> 27:24.397
<i>"Young love lies drowsing
away to poppied death,</i>

27:24.432 --> 27:28.668
<i>cool shadows deepen
across the sleeping face,</i>

27:28.703 --> 27:32.506
so fails the summer with
warm, delicious breath,

27:32.540 --> 27:36.343
and what hath autumn to
give us in its place?

27:36.377 --> 27:39.746
Draw close the curtains
of branched evergreen,

27:39.781 --> 27:44.284
change cannot touch them
with fading fingers sere,

27:44.319 --> 27:48.922
here the first violets
perhaps with bud unseen,

27:48.957 --> 27:53.060
"and a dove, may be,
return to nestle here."

28:00.468 --> 28:02.336
I didn't understand a word of that.

28:03.438 --> 28:04.972
But very beautiful.

28:08.409 --> 28:10.811
Doves.

28:10.845 --> 28:12.479
What can we offer next?

28:12.513 --> 28:15.048
Music? Dance?

28:15.083 --> 28:17.084
Games of chance or skill?

28:17.118 --> 28:20.154
Let's you and me talk, huh?

28:22.324 --> 28:25.860
That's not what you came
here for, Mr. Rosetti.

28:25.894 --> 28:28.296
Don't sell yourself short.

28:33.168 --> 28:35.502
Ladies, if you'll excuse us.

28:39.408 --> 28:41.609
Place looks good.

28:41.644 --> 28:43.811
New rugs.

28:43.846 --> 28:46.881
Standards are important to me.

28:46.916 --> 28:48.850
But the overhead, huh?

28:48.884 --> 28:51.052
<i>Minch'.</i>

28:51.086 --> 28:54.656
It's not something that we like
our patrons to worry about.

28:54.690 --> 28:56.091
Why not?

28:56.125 --> 28:59.027
I worry about it. You worry about it.

28:59.061 --> 29:01.730
Your partner, he worries
about it all the time.

29:01.764 --> 29:04.299
- My partner?
- Luciano, right?

29:04.333 --> 29:06.902
That kid's belly ain't
ever gonna be full.

29:06.936 --> 29:09.304
You know who else?

29:10.740 --> 29:13.175
Nucky Thompson.

29:13.210 --> 29:15.678
He's a worried man.

29:15.712 --> 29:18.748
I wouldn't know anything about that.

29:21.017 --> 29:22.451
Really?

29:23.620 --> 29:25.788
Why would I?

29:31.227 --> 29:33.829
He drops me off here.

29:33.863 --> 29:36.231
Doesn't even come in for a quick hello.

29:37.533 --> 29:40.302
Nucky tends to his affairs
and I tend to mine.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.074
But you pay him, right?

29:45.109 --> 29:47.877
I mean, he gets his
taste no matter what.

29:47.912 --> 29:50.647
Every business has its costs.

29:50.681 --> 29:54.418
What I got to do to make ends
meet, I don't even want to start.

29:54.452 --> 29:57.621
You think you have friends?
It's all dogs with a bone.

29:57.655 --> 30:00.924
What do I do? What's my choice?

30:03.561 --> 30:06.129
You take care of yourself.

30:21.480 --> 30:23.214
You're gorgeous.

30:25.117 --> 30:26.951
And you're smart.

30:26.985 --> 30:29.286
Good businesswoman.

30:29.320 --> 30:31.521
I saw how Nucky treated you out there.

30:31.556 --> 30:33.990
It's like a bad clam in my mouth.

30:34.024 --> 30:35.858
I'm sorry, I have to say it.

30:39.964 --> 30:42.666
Well...

30:42.700 --> 30:45.235
I'm not the only one.

30:45.270 --> 30:48.039
How's that?

30:48.073 --> 30:50.742
I've heard things.

30:52.211 --> 30:53.712
For instance?

30:55.048 --> 30:57.283
I heard...

30:57.317 --> 31:01.153
His own brother tried
to have him killed.

31:02.989 --> 31:05.091
No kidding.

31:06.927 --> 31:09.329
That's what they say.

31:13.234 --> 31:15.301
Well...

31:16.870 --> 31:19.138
Lose your own flesh and blood,

31:19.172 --> 31:21.907
what do you have?

31:25.946 --> 31:28.481
You don't have anything.

31:41.762 --> 31:44.363
You have no idea how
uncomfortable this is.

31:44.398 --> 31:48.133
You've made your discontent
abundantly clear.

31:48.168 --> 31:50.502
I meant the suit.

31:50.536 --> 31:52.471
It shrunk or something.

31:52.505 --> 31:55.207
You look fine.

31:56.542 --> 31:59.277
Do you know the last time
I was even in a church?

31:59.311 --> 32:01.980
On our wedding day.

32:03.116 --> 32:04.849
Nervous?

32:04.884 --> 32:06.885
Tired.

32:06.919 --> 32:08.954
Barely slept again.

32:08.988 --> 32:12.024
Well, what do they say on Broadway?

32:12.058 --> 32:14.827
Show must go on.

32:19.265 --> 32:20.966
Mr. Thompson.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.301
Mrs. Thompson.

33:20.060 --> 33:22.395
<i>We are gathered here today</i>

33:22.429 --> 33:26.232
<i>for what is a rare and special occasion.</i>

33:26.266 --> 33:30.169
<i>The pontifical order of St.
Gregory the great</i>

33:30.203 --> 33:34.707
<i>acknowledges not only
the material generosity</i>

33:34.741 --> 33:37.776
that our honoree exhibits daily,

33:37.810 --> 33:41.847
but his generosity of spirit as well.

33:41.881 --> 33:43.949
<i>Enoch Malachi Thompson,</i>

33:43.984 --> 33:46.051
<i>come forward.</i>

34:00.801 --> 34:03.903
Enoch Malachi Thompson,

34:03.938 --> 34:07.874
for having answered the gospel
summons to brotherly love

34:07.908 --> 34:11.177
and illustrating by your actions

34:11.212 --> 34:13.713
the ideals of the church,

34:13.748 --> 34:16.683
<i>for having enriched the
heritage of humanity</i>

34:16.751 --> 34:20.487
<i>and providing an example
for others to serve,</i>

34:20.521 --> 34:23.456
<i>by order of pope pius xi,</i>

34:23.492 --> 34:26.293
<i>i now bestow upon you the title</i>

34:26.328 --> 34:30.766
of knight commander of the order of St.
Gregory.

34:42.212 --> 34:44.547
Congratulations, my son.

34:55.257 --> 34:57.793
- Say, Georgie.
- Ralph.

34:57.827 --> 35:00.262
Me and the other fellas were
gonna head down to Herkmeyer's

35:00.297 --> 35:02.131
after quitting time. Want to come along?

35:02.165 --> 35:03.899
- What is that?
- <i>Herk's?</i>

35:03.933 --> 35:07.169
It's just a little retreat
where we study the psalms

35:07.203 --> 35:08.904
in tranquility and solitude.

35:10.773 --> 35:13.108
- A speakeasy.
- No flies on George.

35:13.142 --> 35:15.744
Knock back a few. Have some laughs.

35:15.778 --> 35:17.212
What do you say?

35:17.246 --> 35:19.581
Thank you. My wife is expecting me.

35:19.615 --> 35:22.250
Come on. Untie those
apron strings a minute.

35:22.285 --> 35:25.586
Look, we were just razzing
you with that pen gag.

35:25.621 --> 35:27.054
Blowing off steam.

35:27.089 --> 35:29.590
Heck, my first day here, I come out,

35:29.625 --> 35:31.592
<i>they painted my car pink.</i>

35:31.626 --> 35:33.293
With polka dots.

35:33.328 --> 35:36.697
So consider yourself initiated in the
brotherhood of bullshit and blarney.

35:45.341 --> 35:48.677
Nothing wrong with letting
your hair down, I suppose.

35:50.480 --> 35:53.450
<i>A knight, imagine that.</i>

35:53.484 --> 35:55.152
<i>And right in the castle next door.</i>

35:55.186 --> 35:58.555
<i>I've set Philip to work
polishing his armor.</i>

35:58.590 --> 36:02.326
<i>Do you find it gets rusty
in the rain, Mr. Thompson?</i>

36:02.360 --> 36:04.895
Enoch.

36:04.929 --> 36:06.296
Yes?

36:06.331 --> 36:08.198
Cornelia asked you a question.

36:08.232 --> 36:10.367
It was just a joke, really.

36:10.401 --> 36:11.969
About the knighthood.

36:12.003 --> 36:15.205
Yes, it's quite an honor.

36:17.174 --> 36:19.543
Well, I'm sure I'll see you later.

36:21.813 --> 36:24.047
Are you not feeling well?

36:24.082 --> 36:25.549
I'm fine.

36:25.583 --> 36:28.185
I just...

36:30.321 --> 36:32.889
I need to use the facilities.

36:34.358 --> 36:37.994
Mrs. Thompson. Mrs. Thompson.

36:44.168 --> 36:46.736
Kent. Lillian Kent.

36:48.105 --> 36:50.105
Are you sure you don't have
a line down somewhere?

36:50.106 --> 36:52.108
I've been ringing for two days.

36:54.578 --> 36:56.446
Very well. Keep trying.

36:56.480 --> 37:00.150
- May I introduce someone?
- By all means.

37:00.184 --> 37:03.987
Bishop Norman, may I
present Dr. Robert Landau,

37:04.021 --> 37:05.821
chairman of St. Theresa's?

37:05.856 --> 37:07.891
- He's a great admirer.
- Doctor.

37:07.925 --> 37:09.692
Your excellency, it's truly an honor.

37:09.727 --> 37:13.429
Dr. Landau is trying to
convince my husband and I

37:13.464 --> 37:16.799
to sponsor a women's health
clinic at the hospital.

37:16.833 --> 37:19.935
Well, what do you have in mind?

37:21.604 --> 37:24.140
Well, early days yet, really.

37:24.174 --> 37:26.542
But it's come to our
attention that, yes,

37:26.576 --> 37:29.911
many of the women we admit
as patients could benefit.

37:29.946 --> 37:32.281
Seminars, perhaps.

37:32.315 --> 37:34.784
Nutrition, hygiene.

37:34.818 --> 37:36.185
What was it?

37:36.220 --> 37:38.955
Prenatal care.

37:40.491 --> 37:43.859
There are some delicate topics
which would have to be avoided.

37:43.893 --> 37:46.795
- Your excellency, I...
- Mr. Thompson and I felt the same way.

37:46.829 --> 37:48.763
But still and all,

37:48.798 --> 37:51.499
a worthy endeavor, wouldn't you agree?

37:51.534 --> 37:54.836
A touch of the modern, I suppose.

37:54.870 --> 37:56.604
Only a touch.

37:57.606 --> 37:59.607
I'm so sorry.

37:59.641 --> 38:04.078
Father Schuck is a
relentless taskmaster.

38:04.112 --> 38:07.181
You do understand my concerns?

38:07.215 --> 38:09.416
- We...
- We share them.

38:09.451 --> 38:12.052
Then you have my blessing.

38:12.086 --> 38:14.120
Keep me apprised of your progress.

38:14.154 --> 38:16.623
We will. Thank you.

38:21.228 --> 38:23.897
I'm afraid you've finally trapped me.

38:23.931 --> 38:27.433
We'll sponsor the clinic as you wish.

38:42.516 --> 38:43.750
30 grand on the nose.

38:43.784 --> 38:46.486
Better than a punch on the nose.

38:48.122 --> 38:50.323
Right.

38:57.898 --> 39:01.067
Mr. Rosetti, we meet again.

39:01.101 --> 39:03.202
Where's the boss?

39:03.237 --> 39:05.305
Mr. Thompson is indisposed.

39:05.372 --> 39:07.173
What's that supposed to mean?

39:07.208 --> 39:09.209
He isn't here right now.

39:11.012 --> 39:14.581
- And you're...?
- Eli Thompson.

39:17.018 --> 39:18.986
The kid brother.

39:19.020 --> 39:20.721
Heard a lot about you.

39:20.755 --> 39:22.323
You're all loaded up.

39:22.357 --> 39:24.659
So that's it, huh?

39:24.693 --> 39:27.129
The big send-off?

39:27.163 --> 39:29.230
I could christen you with
a bottle of champagne.

39:32.301 --> 39:34.703
Well, tell Nucky I said goodbye.

39:38.308 --> 39:41.277
He had a message for you as well.

39:43.880 --> 39:46.015
"Bone for tuna."

40:16.947 --> 40:20.149
Say, Georgie, they're all
out of sarsaparilla.

40:20.183 --> 40:23.218
Had a boy scout troop in earlier
and they cleared them out.

40:25.754 --> 40:27.488
Near beer will do.

40:27.523 --> 40:31.192
Near beer? Honey, don't
make a schoolgirl cry.

40:31.226 --> 40:33.060
You tell him, toots.

40:33.095 --> 40:35.175
Try a real drink. It'll put
some hair on your chest.

40:39.433 --> 40:41.735
This was just cleaned and pressed.

40:41.769 --> 40:44.838
Nothing a Farraday iron can't fix, huh?

40:48.043 --> 40:50.945
Georgie boy. Come on back.

41:00.022 --> 41:01.656
Ladies and gentlemen,

41:01.690 --> 41:04.426
this is a raid

41:04.460 --> 41:08.730
conducted by your united
states treasury department.

41:08.764 --> 41:11.900
Secretary Andrew mellon wishes you all

41:11.935 --> 41:14.436
<i>a pleasant evening and
would like to inform you</i>

41:14.471 --> 41:16.406
that you are all under arrest.

41:16.440 --> 41:20.010
<i>All alcohol will be
confiscated and catalogued</i>

41:20.044 --> 41:22.613
<i>and the contents of the
cash register obtained</i>

41:22.647 --> 41:26.183
<i>for violation of the volstead act.</i>

41:29.120 --> 41:30.754
<i>"The kama sutree."</i>

41:30.789 --> 41:33.190
<i>Come again?</i>

41:35.560 --> 41:37.694
"The kama sutree."

41:39.697 --> 41:42.032
It's the new thing from Egypt.

41:43.235 --> 41:45.336
You screw upside down

41:45.371 --> 41:47.171
and you don't blow your stack neither.

41:47.206 --> 41:49.741
That's just drunk.

41:49.775 --> 41:52.009
Say, where'd you put that bottle?

41:52.044 --> 41:55.046
It's in my drawers. Why
don't you have a look?

42:04.490 --> 42:07.192
Jesus! Don't shoot!

42:07.226 --> 42:09.494
What the fuck are you doing?

42:09.528 --> 42:12.297
- Get your hat.
- Please. What?

42:12.331 --> 42:14.566
Your hat, put it on.

42:26.745 --> 42:29.047
All right, go.

42:29.081 --> 42:30.882
Go!

42:39.492 --> 42:41.793
Turn around.

42:42.961 --> 42:44.996
- Name?
- George Mueller.

42:45.030 --> 42:47.198
Let's see it.

42:49.368 --> 42:51.069
You come here regular?

42:51.103 --> 42:53.204
No, sir. First time.

42:53.238 --> 42:55.673
Just bad luck, huh?

42:56.976 --> 42:58.476
Occupation?

42:58.510 --> 43:00.745
Salesman.

43:06.652 --> 43:08.620
Why do I know you?

43:08.654 --> 43:11.056
I...

43:11.090 --> 43:14.359
People tell me I remind
them of someone else.

43:14.393 --> 43:17.262
Just one of those faces.

43:17.297 --> 43:19.498
No, that's not it.

43:19.532 --> 43:22.334
I've seen you around somewhere.

43:23.570 --> 43:25.036
You live in Cicero.

43:25.071 --> 43:26.471
Yes. 24th street.

43:26.506 --> 43:28.240
I'm over on 27th.

43:29.575 --> 43:32.845
You shouldn't be in places
like this, neighbor.

43:34.480 --> 43:36.448
I got talked into it.

43:36.482 --> 43:38.684
I'll tell you what.

43:38.718 --> 43:41.186
Pay the fine direct to me,

43:41.220 --> 43:43.588
and we'll leave it at that.

43:45.358 --> 43:46.858
Pay you the fine?

43:46.892 --> 43:48.827
That's how it works.

43:57.937 --> 44:01.472
You must be a pitiful salesman
if this is all you got on you.

44:03.342 --> 44:05.943
Don't let me see you here again.

44:23.694 --> 44:25.763
<i>So they load the coffin
in the ship, right?</i>

44:25.797 --> 44:28.699
<i>And there's this scene, it
moves around all by itself.</i>

44:28.734 --> 44:31.769
No one's touching it. And then
orlock comes out at night,

44:31.804 --> 44:33.838
and the whole crew, he
drinks their blood.

44:33.873 --> 44:36.241
Corpses. Nothing left but the rats.

44:36.275 --> 44:37.742
And you got to see this fella...

44:37.777 --> 44:41.345
Skinny, humpback, fingernails like this.

44:43.082 --> 44:45.722
I tell you, he don't give you the
willies, I don't know what will.

44:45.723 --> 44:48.685
- Bone for tuna.
- What?

44:48.720 --> 44:52.556
Bone for tuna. What the
fuck's that supposed to mean?

44:52.590 --> 44:55.758
The kid's Irish. The
pronunciation was off.

44:55.793 --> 44:58.127
- I think he meant...
- I know what he meant.

44:58.162 --> 45:02.198
Who the fuck is Nucky Thompson
to wish me good luck?

45:02.233 --> 45:04.367
And in Italian no less,

45:04.401 --> 45:06.102
like he's mocking me?

45:06.137 --> 45:08.338
He's real cute, I'll fucking tell you.

45:08.372 --> 45:10.873
Sets me up to lose.

45:10.908 --> 45:13.409
Pulls our whiskey deal
at the last minute.

45:13.444 --> 45:16.813
Then it's <i>buon fortuna</i> like he's
rooting for me to get back on my feet.

45:16.847 --> 45:18.614
Push me off a cliff, why don't you?

45:18.649 --> 45:19.900
Sure, I mean...

45:19.901 --> 45:21.701
<i>Good luck flapping your
arms on the way down.</i>

45:21.702 --> 45:22.785
- Am I right?
- Sure, I...

45:22.819 --> 45:26.322
Real attitude on him.
Scrawny Irish prick.

45:27.958 --> 45:30.627
I need his blessing to
make my way in the world?

45:30.661 --> 45:34.030
- He...
- I need him to lecture me?

45:34.065 --> 45:36.666
Nothing's personal?

45:36.701 --> 45:40.637
What the fuck is life
if it's not personal?

45:55.018 --> 45:57.220
Congratulations from Frank hague,

45:57.254 --> 45:59.389
Attorney General daugherty,

45:59.423 --> 46:00.790
senator edge.

46:00.825 --> 46:02.792
Bring the car around.

46:02.826 --> 46:04.794
We are going out?

46:07.298 --> 46:10.234
I will pull around out back.

46:29.653 --> 46:32.154
- What the fuck is this?
- I didn't mean nothing by it.

46:32.188 --> 46:34.823
It was just a rib. A joke.

46:34.858 --> 46:36.958
A man's death is no laughing matter.

46:36.993 --> 46:40.595
I don't know what this is, but I
don't want it happening here.

46:40.629 --> 46:42.297
Tell him.

46:42.331 --> 46:44.833
Nucky, you've got to believe me.

46:46.602 --> 46:48.603
- Mr. harrow.
- Didn't do it!

46:48.637 --> 46:52.273
Didn't do it! I didn't
kill Manny Horvitz.

46:52.307 --> 46:54.208
- Whoever said you did?
- <i>He said it.</i>

46:54.242 --> 46:57.145
I was only blowing smoke, okay?

46:57.179 --> 47:01.582
<i>Shooting my mouth off just
to keep things lively.</i>

47:01.617 --> 47:04.352
I never went near him. I swear.

47:04.386 --> 47:05.953
He's telling the truth.

47:07.356 --> 47:09.090
How do you know?

47:10.426 --> 47:12.193
How do you think?

47:16.732 --> 47:18.299
Jesus.

47:19.768 --> 47:23.070
Could you ask him to put the gun away?

47:24.138 --> 47:25.906
Please?

47:25.973 --> 47:28.241
Would you?

47:41.387 --> 47:43.088
So...

47:46.392 --> 47:48.961
I'm gonna go.

47:50.864 --> 47:53.532
And we're good on this, right?

47:55.902 --> 47:58.137
You need to talk to him.

48:09.751 --> 48:12.954
I waited outside his house.

48:14.423 --> 48:18.093
I used a shotgun very close.

48:18.128 --> 48:21.229
May I ask why?

48:21.264 --> 48:24.199
Angela Darmody.

48:31.974 --> 48:34.642
Not her husband?

48:34.710 --> 48:37.312
Jimmy was a soldier.

48:38.681 --> 48:41.350
He fought, he lost.

48:43.386 --> 48:46.922
So I can assume my
family and I are safe?

48:48.425 --> 48:51.193
You and Mrs. Thompson

48:51.228 --> 48:52.828
were good to me.

48:52.863 --> 48:56.098
<i>You have nothing to fear.</i>

49:02.139 --> 49:04.641
How many people have you killed?

49:05.810 --> 49:08.445
63.

49:11.182 --> 49:13.817
Do you think about any of them?

49:15.019 --> 49:18.422
You know the answer to that yourself.

49:29.434 --> 49:31.969
<i>I'd give anything for you
to have seen his face.</i>

49:32.003 --> 49:34.438
It was absolutely priceless.

49:34.472 --> 49:36.807
I have to admit, I'm
amazed you pulled it off.

49:36.841 --> 49:39.643
I'm sure you intended
that as a compliment.

49:39.677 --> 49:42.346
310. 312.

49:42.380 --> 49:45.482
Here we are.

49:50.554 --> 49:52.522
I changed tobaccos.

49:57.861 --> 50:00.897
Dr. Mason, I present to you

50:00.931 --> 50:04.500
the future home of St.
Theresa's women's clinic.

50:08.805 --> 50:12.107
Well, needs a bit of work.

50:43.776 --> 50:47.246
So, that's it, then, eh?

50:47.280 --> 50:49.181
What is?

50:49.215 --> 50:51.984
Understand you boys are
heading back to New York.

50:52.019 --> 50:54.854
Yeah? Where'd you hear that?

50:54.889 --> 50:57.190
Nucky's man Owen.

51:01.161 --> 51:04.464
You know, you shouldn't be
smoking around the gas pumps.

51:04.498 --> 51:06.332
Yeah? Why is that?

51:06.366 --> 51:07.800
It's flammable, that's why.

51:07.834 --> 51:11.370
Right.

51:13.740 --> 51:16.208
Well, good luck to you now.

51:18.278 --> 51:20.512
How's that?

51:20.546 --> 51:22.114
I said good luck.

51:26.820 --> 51:28.855
Give me that.

51:28.889 --> 51:31.558
Hey, sheriff.

51:31.592 --> 51:34.494
I think we're gonna
stick around a while.

51:34.528 --> 51:35.996
What the hell are you doing?

51:38.533 --> 51:40.301
<i>What the fuck?</i>

52:27.313 --> 52:29.615
Billie?

54:11.288 --> 54:13.089
Well, look who's up.

54:15.493 --> 54:17.460
When did you get home?

54:18.662 --> 54:20.697
Little while ago.

54:20.731 --> 54:23.633
Didn't want to wake you.

54:26.337 --> 54:28.404
I thought I was having a nightmare.

54:28.438 --> 54:30.606
About what?

54:38.048 --> 54:40.282
I was alone.

54:52.194 --> 54:54.529
Well, you're not alone anymore, are you?

54:54.729 --> 54:58.829
