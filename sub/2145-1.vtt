It's crucial that we destroy this nest.

03:45.092 --> 03:47.226
It's a potential death trap

Vassili, alexei, you flank it from the right and left.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.897

10:27.593 --> 10:30.629
Sergei:
<i>Where is it?</i>

10:30.631 --> 10:34.299
Some mining village in the middle of nowhere.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.568
We're not far.

10:36.570 --> 10:39.738
- (Spits)
- If we get a move-on, we can be there by noon.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.407
Don't you think it's strange?

10:42.409 --> 10:45.210
Who is tiger bear?

10:45.212 --> 10:46.544
I thought we were the only reconnaissance.

10:46.546 --> 10:48.947

10:48.949 --> 10:51.683
Our boys. They need help.

You better inform mother.

10:59.292 --> 11:00.992

11:00.994 --> 11:02.594
That crazy message

Dimitri:
<i>Is that it?</i>

12:48.435 --> 12:51.469
There's a lot of damage.
There's been fighting here.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.838
Do you see anything?

12:53.840 --> 12:56.641
Nothing. No Russians.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.610
No Germans.

12:58.612 --> 13:00.545
Not even a stinking goat.

13:00.547 --> 13:04.082
All right, we go in through the trees.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.684
Very slowly, huh?

13:06.686 --> 13:09.687
And you...

13:09.689 --> 13:11.456

14:39.645 --> 14:41.913
<i>That's artillery damage,</i>

<i>We don't have artillery</i>

14:45.986 --> 14:48.486
within 50 kilometers of here.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.822
Who did this?

14:51.924 --> 14:53.925
Let's move down to the church,

14:53.927 --> 14:56.594

15:25.624 --> 15:27.759
Ivan: I don't care who did this.

It's the only explanation.

23:38.451 --> 23:41.452
It's been days since I got a scratch out
of the damn thing.

23:41.454 --> 23:44.054
What if we use the tower?

23:44.056 --> 23:46.757
That's not a bad idea.

23:46.759 --> 23:49.160
Not a bad idea.

23:51.062 --> 23:53.063
Dimitri:
<i>Vasja! Vasja!</i>

23:53.065 --> 23:55.466
<i>We are here now. You heard their mayday.</i>

23:55.468 --> 23:57.334
<i>Our boys need help.</i>

23:57.336 --> 23:59.336
Where the fuck are they then, huh?

23:59.338 --> 24:01.105
<i>Listen, we need to search the village properly.</i>

24:01.107 --> 24:04.442
<i>Otherwise, novikov has died for nothing.</i>

24:04.444 --> 24:08.746
(Sighs)
He's right, vasja.

24:08.748 --> 24:11.482
Take the others.
I'll stay here with Sasha and the gear.

24:11.484 --> 24:13.250
Go to the village, fine someone...

24:13.252 --> 24:15.553
anyone... who can tell us what is going on here.

24:15.555 --> 24:17.788
Correct me if I'm wrong, seryosha.

24:17.790 --> 24:20.124
But I'm next in command after novikov.

24:20.126 --> 24:23.027
I don't think so. Look at the stripes.

24:23.029 --> 24:24.562
Who gives a fuck about stripes?!

24:24.564 --> 24:26.464
I have been with this unit longer than anyone.

24:26.466 --> 24:28.499
That doesn't mean you're in charge, vasja!

24:28.501 --> 24:30.067
Oh, no?
(Chuckles)

24:30.069 --> 24:31.569
Well, let's ask the others.

24:31.571 --> 24:33.204
Dimitri:
<i>Vasja, sergei's right.</i>

24:33.206 --> 24:34.572
Shut the fuck up, you Jew boy!

24:34.574 --> 24:36.474
You are here just to make pretty pictures.

24:36.476 --> 24:38.476
Ivan:
<i>Vasja, you're too smart to be in charge.</i>

24:38.478 --> 24:40.377
Let seryosha have his fun.

24:40.379 --> 24:42.813
We can always slit his throat later.

24:42.815 --> 24:45.282
Sasha:
<i>Alexei?</i>

24:45.284 --> 24:47.284
Sasha?

24:47.286 --> 24:49.186
You want him to be in command?

24:49.188 --> 24:51.589
<i>The fucking radio ham?</i>

24:51.591 --> 24:53.290
<i>He's not even Russian.</i>

24:56.228 --> 24:58.128
<i>Okay.</i>

24:58.130 --> 25:00.397
Have it your way.

25:00.399 --> 25:02.399
But don't come crying to me
when he leads us into

25:02.401 --> 25:04.535
some fritzy trap.

25:04.537 --> 25:06.170
Stupid fucking film!

25:06.172 --> 25:08.506
Dimitri:
<i>Comrade, control your temper.</i>

25:18.617 --> 25:21.385
<i>(Leaves rustling, metal clanking softly)</i>

25:27.092 --> 25:30.160
Make another sound,
I'll fucking shoot your balls off.

25:33.598 --> 25:36.300
Dimitri:
<i>Alexei. Where are you going?</i>

25:38.103 --> 25:40.704
<i>(Distant whimpering)</i>

25:48.480 --> 25:51.181
Dima, it'd be safer outside.

25:53.184 --> 25:55.519
Do not get in my way.

26:01.660 --> 26:05.362
<i>(Whimpering, barking)</i>

26:11.469 --> 26:13.470
Vassili:
Ooh, I have found some dinner.

26:13.472 --> 26:15.306
Mmm!

26:18.209 --> 26:20.411
Come here, little bunny.

26:20.413 --> 26:23.147
Come over here.
(Grunts)

26:31.222 --> 26:33.223
Dimitri:
<i>Guys, look! There is someone here!</i>

26:33.225 --> 26:34.525
- <i>(Gunshot)</i>
<i>- (Grunts)</i>

26:34.527 --> 26:36.160
Vassili:
<i>No, alexei, no!</i>

26:36.162 --> 26:37.595
<i>(Dogs barking, howling)</i>

26:37.597 --> 26:41.231
Alexei! Alexei!

26:41.233 --> 26:43.233
We're supposed to get a prisoner, remember?

26:43.235 --> 26:45.636
To interrogate, find out where our boys are.

26:45.638 --> 26:48.372
Yeah?

26:48.374 --> 26:51.508
<i>Sie sind in meine house.</i>

26:51.510 --> 26:53.344
What's the crazy old tramp saying, huh?

26:53.346 --> 26:55.646
Dimitri:
<i>Something about stealing his rabbits.</i>

26:55.648 --> 26:58.415
Oh, no no no no no no. No no no.

26:58.417 --> 27:02.252
I'm liberating your rabbits from fascist oppression.

27:04.255 --> 27:05.956
- What is this place?!
- I do not understand.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.391
What is this?!

27:07.393 --> 27:09.393
Dimitri:
<i>If you let me...</i>

27:09.395 --> 27:11.395
<i>I have experience in these sort of...</i>

27:11.397 --> 27:14.531
- <i>Interviews.</i>
<i>- Interviews, yeah?</i>

27:14.533 --> 27:16.333
This I want to see.

27:25.276 --> 27:28.412
What is going on here, huh?

27:28.414 --> 27:30.781
Where has everybody gone?

27:32.584 --> 27:35.586
Everybody's dead or run away.

27:35.588 --> 27:38.355
What were they running from?

27:41.559 --> 27:44.428
That's a weird camera.

27:44.430 --> 27:46.563
Is that a microphone?

27:46.565 --> 27:48.565
Are you recording sound?

27:48.567 --> 27:51.235
I've never seen a camera like this before.

27:51.237 --> 27:53.637
(Sighs)

27:55.407 --> 27:57.541
What were they running from?

27:57.543 --> 28:00.544
(Stammering) I...

28:00.546 --> 28:03.547
from... from things...

28:03.549 --> 28:05.549
- What things?
- ...The doctor makes.

28:05.551 --> 28:08.018
What things?

28:08.020 --> 28:09.753
Where is the doctor now?

28:09.755 --> 28:12.256
Shut it! Who give a fuck about this doctor?!

28:12.258 --> 28:14.491
We want to know about tiger bear 3-0-3.

28:14.493 --> 28:15.993
Ivan, hold him!

28:15.995 --> 28:17.728
Comrade, listen. There was obviously

28:17.730 --> 28:19.730
some sort of secret project going on here.

28:19.732 --> 28:21.732
Ha, that's obvious, is it?

28:21.734 --> 28:24.368
Tiger bear was even
sent here for this very reason.

28:24.370 --> 28:26.370
Listen, if you find the doctor, you'll probably find...

28:26.372 --> 28:27.805
fucking fascinating, comrade!

28:27.807 --> 28:29.606
Now get the fuck behind the camera.

28:29.608 --> 28:31.442
<i>We have wasted enough time.</i>

28:33.812 --> 28:38.482
Where are the Russians?!

28:38.484 --> 28:41.018
- Where?!
- I don't know. Aah!

28:41.020 --> 28:43.020
(Screaming)

28:43.022 --> 28:45.355
I just feed the animals.

28:45.357 --> 28:46.690
Where?!

28:46.692 --> 28:49.326
(Moaning)

28:49.328 --> 28:51.729
I'll take you there.

28:51.731 --> 28:53.497
Oh, you'll take me there?

28:53.499 --> 28:55.766
You will never have to worry
about getting hurt ever again.

28:55.768 --> 28:58.502
- (Screaming)
- Come on, let's go.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.375
Keep moving!

29:05.377 --> 29:07.778
Dimitri:
<i>Vasja, do you think this is wise?</i>

29:07.780 --> 29:09.713
Shut up.

29:09.715 --> 29:12.349
<i>What if there are more like</i>
<i>the ones in the church, huh?</i>

29:12.351 --> 29:13.817
Here.

29:24.629 --> 29:26.630
It's down there.

29:26.632 --> 29:28.432
The Russian soldiers are down there?

29:28.434 --> 29:29.900
Yes.

29:35.073 --> 29:36.540
Down there?!

29:36.542 --> 29:39.076
Yeah, you... you go, you'll see.

29:39.078 --> 29:40.611
It's not safe here, vasja.

29:40.613 --> 29:42.412
Let's just take him back to seryosha.

29:42.414 --> 29:44.548
I'm in charge here, so fucking do what I tell you!

29:44.550 --> 29:45.716
Show us!

29:45.718 --> 29:46.884
No no, I wait...

29:46.886 --> 29:48.886
no, you fucking show us! Come on!

29:48.888 --> 29:50.954
(Groaning)

30:03.768 --> 30:05.402
Dimitri:
<i>Vasja, keep an eye on him.</i>

30:17.582 --> 30:19.650
<i>How far is it?</i>

30:21.386 --> 30:22.719
<i>This way?</i>

30:24.722 --> 30:26.590
<i>You go fir...</i>

30:26.592 --> 30:28.859
<i>fuck!</i>

30:28.861 --> 30:31.562
<i>Where has he gone? Where has he gone?</i>

30:31.564 --> 30:32.830
<i>I told you, keep an eye on him!</i>

30:32.832 --> 30:34.665
Where the hell?

30:36.167 --> 30:37.835
<i>You go ahead.</i>

30:40.605 --> 30:42.873
Ivan, check that side.

30:42.875 --> 30:45.609
<i>Alexei, over there.</i>

30:46.911 --> 30:48.612
<i>Where the hell is he?</i>

31:16.207 --> 31:18.809
- Vassili: What?
- <i>(Metal clanking)</i>

31:18.811 --> 31:20.978
Shit! What the...?

31:20.980 --> 31:22.613
(Growling)

31:22.615 --> 31:24.815
Vassili:
<i>Get out of the way!</i>

31:27.552 --> 31:29.953
(Metal scraping)

31:33.224 --> 31:34.958
- (Gunfire)
- Dimitri: <i>Don't shoot!</i>

31:34.960 --> 31:37.861
<i>You're gonna shoot me, you idiot!</i>

31:37.863 --> 31:39.830
Vassili:
<i>Get out!</i>

31:41.966 --> 31:43.567
Dimitri:
<i>Go go!</i>

31:43.569 --> 31:44.935
<i>Shoot! Shoot!</i>

31:44.937 --> 31:48.672
Ivan:
<i>Ow! Help! Alexei!</i>

31:48.674 --> 31:50.707
<i>Fucking hell!</i>

31:50.709 --> 31:52.976
Vassili:
<i>Let's get out of here now! Get out of here!</i>

31:52.978 --> 31:54.645
Dimitri:
<i>This way! Go go go go!</i>

31:54.647 --> 31:57.047
- (Growling)
- Ah!

32:05.623 --> 32:07.758
(Screeching)

32:07.760 --> 32:09.660
(Grunts)

32:09.662 --> 32:12.062
Dimitri:
<i>Kill it! Kill it!</i>

32:12.064 --> 32:14.631
<i>Get the hell out of here now!</i>

32:19.070 --> 32:20.771
Get out!

32:23.007 --> 32:25.876
Let's get out of here now.

32:25.878 --> 32:27.711
Ivan:
<i>Over here! This way, this way.</i>

32:27.713 --> 32:29.980
<i>This direction! Here.</i>

32:29.982 --> 32:31.915
Dimitri:
<i>There's one more! There's one more there.</i>

32:31.917 --> 32:33.951
- <i>Go go go!</i>
<i>- (Gunshot)</i>

32:35.286 --> 32:37.688

<i>- (Siren blaring)</i>

32:41.660 --> 32:43.660
Dimitri:
<i>Guys, where are you?</i>

32:43.662 --> 32:45.896
- Ivan: Over here.
- <i>Close the door! Close the door!</i>

32:45.898 --> 32:47.097

32:55.006 --> 32:57.574
<i>Kill it! Kill it! Shoot it! Shoot it!</i>

32:59.944 --> 33:01.111
<i>Shoot it!</i>

33:01.113 --> 33:03.146
(Grunting, screaming)

33:09.087 --> 33:10.854
<i>Right now! Get away, get away!</i>

33:14.058 --> 33:15.759
<i>Run!</i>

33:15.761 --> 33:17.794
<i>Run run run run run!</i>

33:20.131 --> 33:22.666
(All coughing)

33:22.668 --> 33:24.968
(Screaming)

33:24.970 --> 33:26.803
Come on!

33:26.805 --> 33:29.072

33:29.074 --> 33:30.807
<i>(Siren continues)</i>

33:32.977 --> 33:34.778
- Get it off.
- No.

33:34.780 --> 33:37.047
Vanja, I don't think that's a good idea.

33:37.049 --> 33:39.149
Please...
(Breathing deeply)

33:39.151 --> 33:41.718
Relax, my friend, I'm not giving up on you yet.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.086
Vassili:
<i>Leave him! He's finished.</i>

33:43.088 --> 33:45.088
We're getting out of here.

33:45.090 --> 33:46.823
Get back to your post.
You're supposed to be keeping watch.

33:46.825 --> 33:48.625
Fuck you!

33:48.627 --> 33:50.761
Those things, they appeared out of nowhere.

33:50.763 --> 33:52.996
They could all around us
and we wouldn't even know.

33:52.998 --> 33:54.164
Get the fuck out of the way!

33:54.166 --> 33:55.766
I'll finish him off.

33:58.169 --> 34:00.804
(Groans) Fuck!

34:00.806 --> 34:03.106
Ivan: <i>Ah...</i>

34:03.108 --> 34:05.075
Vasja!

34:05.077 --> 34:07.778
<i>I'll fucking decide when I'm finished</i>

34:07.780 --> 34:10.112
<i>and who finishes me off.</i>

34:10.114 --> 34:12.882
<i>Where's that freak?</i>

34:12.885 --> 34:16.786
Who? Dima?

34:16.789 --> 34:18.955
<i>(Ivan laughs)</i>

34:18.956 --> 34:22.092
No, you idiot.

34:22.094 --> 34:24.860
That tramp...

34:24.862 --> 34:26.129
Set us up.

34:26.130 --> 34:28.998
Tramp.

34:29.001 --> 34:31.001
"I just feed the animals."

34:31.003 --> 34:34.438
(Laughing, panting)

34:34.440 --> 34:36.907
This is your fault!

34:36.909 --> 34:39.109
You were supposed to bring a captive back here.

34:41.012 --> 34:44.281
(Blows nose loudly)

34:47.118 --> 34:49.886
Dimitri:
<i>(Whispering) Sasha.</i>

34:49.888 --> 34:52.121
<i>Everything all right here?</i>

34:55.827 --> 34:58.028
You're an educated man, dima.

35:00.031 --> 35:03.166
What do you think is going on here?

35:03.168 --> 35:07.170
<i>I am not sure.</i>

35:07.172 --> 35:10.474
<i>I think we stumbled upon a new Nazi weapon.</i>

35:10.476 --> 35:13.076
(Exhales deeply)

35:13.078 --> 35:16.713
Only the Nazis would think of something like this.

35:16.715 --> 35:19.249
(Sighs)

35:19.251 --> 35:23.053
Sewing dead people together...

35:23.055 --> 35:25.789
And giving them knives for hands.

35:27.058 --> 35:29.025
It's insane.

35:29.027 --> 35:31.161
<i>Or brilliant.</i>

35:31.163 --> 35:33.797
(Sighs deeply)

35:33.799 --> 35:36.800
No, dima...

35:36.802 --> 35:38.869
It's insane.

35:50.815 --> 35:52.883
We'll move in the morning.

35:54.485 --> 35:57.087
And then we'll find this...

35:57.089 --> 35:59.022
Tiger bear 3-0-3.

35:59.024 --> 36:01.791
They're dead.

36:01.793 --> 36:04.060
And we will be too if we
hang around here any longer.

36:04.062 --> 36:07.097
<i>(Gunshots)</i>

36:07.099 --> 36:09.499
Vasja, go down!

36:09.501 --> 36:11.034
Sasha!

36:14.872 --> 36:17.274
<i>(Muffled yelling)</i>

36:21.512 --> 36:22.979
Go around.

36:22.981 --> 36:24.981
<i>Sasha!</i>

36:24.983 --> 36:26.983
(Door creaks open)

36:26.985 --> 36:28.518
Hands up! Hands in the air!

36:28.520 --> 36:31.121
Come on! Hold your fire!

36:31.123 --> 36:32.856
Hold your fire!

36:32.858 --> 36:34.524
(People whimpering)

36:34.526 --> 36:36.526
Against the wall! Over there!

36:36.528 --> 36:38.261
(Grunting)

36:38.263 --> 36:40.530
That's a girl. That's a girl.

36:55.581 --> 36:57.147
You are Russians, no?

36:57.149 --> 36:59.316
There were other Russians here...

36:59.318 --> 37:02.352
- <i>Yesterday!</i>

37:02.354 --> 37:04.854
We've been hiding.

Just the four of you?

37:07.259 --> 37:10.026
<i>Everyone else was killed or ran.</i>

37:10.028 --> 37:12.562
- There was a massacre.
- Who killed them?

37:12.564 --> 37:15.899
The undead ones. Listen...

37:15.901 --> 37:18.034
The gunshots, the fire light,

we must hide before they come looking.

37:40.058 --> 37:43.326
Uh... uh, Fritz says it's okay if you shoot him.

37:43.328 --> 37:45.195
He'd rather be shot by a real man than

37:45.197 --> 37:48.198
ripped apart by those things out there.

01:07:08.057 --> 01:07:10.759
- Come in.
- <i>Yes yes, I'm coming.</i>

01:07:13.729 --> 01:07:14.996
Come in.

01:07:14.998 --> 01:07:16.931
I want to show you something.

01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:24.773
This is the generator.

01:07:24.775 --> 01:07:26.908

<i>- Look.</i>

01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:29.677

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:34.883
It works!

01:07:34.885 --> 01:07:37.018
<i>Genius. This is genius!</i>

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:38.887
Come with me. Come.

01:07:38.889 --> 01:07:40.822
I'll show you something else.

01:07:40.824 --> 01:07:43.158
<i>Doctor...</i>

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:46.428
- What?
- <i>Listen.</i>

01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:48.897
<i>Listen!</i>

01:07:48.899 --> 01:07:51.800
<i>Can't you hear it?</i>

01:07:51.802 --> 01:07:53.034
What was that?

01:07:53.036 --> 01:07:55.437
<i>It's us... the red army.</i>

01:07:55.439 --> 01:07:56.938
<i>Our artillery.</i>

01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:00.942
How far away would you say they are?

01:08:00.944 --> 01:08:03.945
<i>15 kilometers.</i>
<i>They could be here in a matter of hours.</i>

01:08:03.947 --> 01:08:06.948
You telling me this because?

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:08.950
<i>I am here to offer you a deal.</i>

01:08:08.952 --> 01:08:12.187
<i>Our military leadership is</i>
<i>very interested in your work.</i>

01:08:12.189 --> 01:08:14.255
Of course.

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:17.258
It would give them a weapon
to use against Western allies.

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:20.261
To turn the whole world
into to socialist utopia, right?

01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:23.231
<i>Yes. We understand each other very well.</i>

01:08:25.267 --> 01:08:27.268
And if I refuse?

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:30.471
<i>We'll bomb you and your army</i>
<i>back to the stone age.</i>

01:08:30.474 --> 01:08:33.041

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:41.349
Oh, fucking...
(Mumbles)

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:46.220
(Muffled moaning)

01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:50.225
- In experiments...
- <i>(Distant radio chatter)</i>

01:08:50.227 --> 01:08:52.961
...the fresher the specimens the better.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:57.532
And if I can use flesh that is still alive,

01:08:57.533 --> 01:08:59.868
I can perform miracles.

01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:03.304
<i>Still alive?</i>

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:07.075
Tell me, which of these two...

01:09:07.077 --> 01:09:09.511
Is a better communist?

01:09:09.513 --> 01:09:11.845
<i>What?</i>

01:09:11.848 --> 01:09:14.983
Which of these two is a better communist?

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:17.118
<i>(Stuttering) This one is a better communist.</i>

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:19.319
<i>Don't! No!</i>

01:09:19.322 --> 01:09:20.988
<i>I...</i>

01:09:20.991 --> 01:09:23.858
(exhales sharply)

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:25.326
Hans!

<i>(Erratic beeping)</i>

01:09:29.232 --> 01:09:31.799
- Viktor: <i>Ready?</i>
<i>- Dimitri: Yes.</i>

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:38.139
So, <i>sturmbahnfuhrer... We meet again.</i>

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:40.341
Viktor...
(Speaking in German)

01:09:42.144 --> 01:09:44.879
Hush now, dieter. You don't have to apologize.

01:09:44.881 --> 01:09:47.148
I'm going to make it all okay.

01:09:47.149 --> 01:09:49.584
Doctor, there's no time!
The red army's almost here.

01:09:49.586 --> 01:09:52.319
- If you want to work for me you need to tell me now.
- Enough!

01:09:52.322 --> 01:09:55.089
I said I would think about it. Now focus.

01:09:56.292 --> 01:09:58.226
<i>Nein.</i>

01:09:58.228 --> 01:09:59.561
(Trilling)

01:09:59.563 --> 01:10:02.130
(Muffled speaking)

01:10:06.569 --> 01:10:09.137
(Muffled drilling)

01:10:28.857 --> 01:10:31.259
Hey!

01:10:31.261 --> 01:10:33.995
- I told you to film.
- <i>Sorry.</i>

01:10:46.275 --> 01:10:47.909
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:10:47.911 --> 01:10:51.312
Don't you see?

01:10:51.314 --> 01:10:53.314
I can... I can end the war

01:10:53.316 --> 01:10:55.216
by creating a new being

01:10:55.218 --> 01:10:58.319
that brings them together.

01:10:58.321 --> 01:11:01.623
<i>Are you serious?</i>

01:11:01.625 --> 01:11:04.626
I can make them stop.

01:11:04.628 --> 01:11:07.195
I can make them understand each other.

01:11:17.973 --> 01:11:19.307
I'll be right back.

01:11:22.077 --> 01:11:24.212
Dima...

01:11:24.214 --> 01:11:26.948
Dima... help me.

01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:32.287
Help me, please. Please.

01:11:32.289 --> 01:11:35.456
<i>I can't, seryosha. I have to bring him back</i>

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:37.959
<i>no matter what.</i>

01:11:37.961 --> 01:11:40.962
Dima, huh?

01:11:40.964 --> 01:11:43.097
Don't you understand?

01:11:43.099 --> 01:11:47.001
He's crazy. Dima, he's insane.

01:11:47.003 --> 01:11:50.104
- Please.
- <i>I told you, I told you, <i>i can't.</i></i>

01:11:50.106 --> 01:11:51.939
<i>I promise you this, seryosha:</i>

<i>When I return to moscow, i will personally ensure</i>

(Groaning, screaming)

01:11:57.414 --> 01:12:00.014
- <i>Your sacrifice will not be forgotten!</i>
<i>- Dima!</i>

01:12:00.016 --> 01:12:02.250
I swear! I'll kill you!

01:12:02.252 --> 01:12:04.252
I swear I'll kill you!

01:12:04.254 --> 01:12:06.087
(Panting)

01:12:13.696 --> 01:12:16.264

(Screaming)

01:12:20.370 --> 01:12:22.270

<i>(Drilling, screaming continues)</i>

<i>(Drilling and screaming ceases)</i>

01:12:35.718 --> 01:12:38.052
As you can see, the two halves of the brain

01:12:38.054 --> 01:12:40.054
have been grafted together.

01:12:40.056 --> 01:12:42.323
On the left side, the communist's.

01:12:42.325 --> 01:12:44.192
Hold on.

01:12:44.194 --> 01:12:45.426
Yeah.

01:12:45.428 --> 01:12:48.162
On the right side, the Nazi's.

01:12:50.432 --> 01:12:52.734
Yeah. That will be...

01:12:52.736 --> 01:12:56.204
it's too much here. Okay.

01:12:56.206 --> 01:12:57.472
I think...

01:12:57.474 --> 01:12:59.540
oh, shit.

01:13:01.744 --> 01:13:04.078
Okay, that's fine.

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:06.013
<i>(Camera whirring)</i>

01:13:06.015 --> 01:13:07.482

01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:18.426
I can fix it.

01:13:23.298 --> 01:13:26.567
The patient is no longer breathing.

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:29.237
Now...

01:13:29.239 --> 01:13:31.205
For the final step.

01:13:46.822 --> 01:13:49.323
<i>Drei... zwei...</i>

(Gurgling, screaming)

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:06.474
It's obviously suffering from
a little readjustment problem!

01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:09.577
I can do more!

01:14:09.579 --> 01:14:11.179

<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:14:29.598 --> 01:14:32.233
How does that work?

01:14:32.235 --> 01:14:33.901
I need a different lens.

01:14:33.903 --> 01:14:36.204
How do you operate this camera?

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:40.575
Doctor, we had a deal.

01:14:40.577 --> 01:14:42.877
Listen, we had a deal.

01:14:42.879 --> 01:14:45.346
Huh? You will be safe in Russia.

01:14:45.348 --> 01:14:47.482
What deal?

01:14:47.484 --> 01:14:49.484
We have people there...

01:14:49.486 --> 01:14:52.620
Orders... enemies of the state, huh?

01:14:52.622 --> 01:14:54.889
You will be safe.

01:14:54.891 --> 01:14:56.691
What about our deal?!

01:14:56.693 --> 01:14:59.660
I'm afraid I am going to have to
refuse your generous offer.

01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:01.662
You are signing your own death warrant.

01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:04.365
If we don't kill you, your own people will.
Understand that?

01:15:04.367 --> 01:15:05.600
Oh, yes, I know.

01:15:05.602 --> 01:15:07.635
I was in a prison camp, remember?

01:15:07.637 --> 01:15:09.937
But I have other plans.

01:15:09.939 --> 01:15:12.273
No no no no, don't leave me! Don't go!

01:15:12.275 --> 01:15:14.609
- Ah!
- I'll be leaving momentarily.

01:15:14.611 --> 01:15:18.179
But there should be time for one last experiment.

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:23.518
No, you can't... you can't.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.286
I can. I can!

01:15:25.288 --> 01:15:26.721
Come here, come here.

01:15:26.723 --> 01:15:29.724
Now what shall we do with you?

01:15:29.726 --> 01:15:31.926
Maybe... maybe I will

01:15:31.928 --> 01:15:34.929
build this camera into your skull.

01:15:34.931 --> 01:15:37.498
That might be fun.

01:15:41.637 --> 01:15:43.471

01:15:48.977 --> 01:15:52.780
A man... a man of vision is always misunderstood.

01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:58.686
But the film in your camera...

01:15:58.688 --> 01:16:01.422
Will convince the doubters.

capitalists, everyone!

01:16:17.273 --> 01:16:19.540
The sickness cannot be cured...

01:16:19.542 --> 01:16:21.309
So it must be cut out.

01:16:21.311 --> 01:16:22.710
And my creations will do that.

I had no choice.

I injected him with...
with a drug that paralyzed him.

01:16:52.308 --> 01:16:55.710
But his eyes could still move,
so he could watch as I...
