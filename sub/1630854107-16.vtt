WEBVTT

00:18.186 --> 00:19.487
Late again.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.424
Morning, ma'am.
Sorry I'm late.

00:23.524 --> 00:24.892
The drive-through
at Capitol Cruller

00:24.992 --> 00:26.760
is closed this week
for repaving.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.962
No excuses,
Petty Officer Sheehan.

00:29.063 --> 00:31.432
Smooth seas don't make
skillful sailors.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.434
Yes, ma'am. But maybe
instead of waiting

00:33.534 --> 00:35.103
at the walkup window
for an hour...

00:35.203 --> 00:38.106
I could get your nine-shot,
one-pump mocha chai latte

00:38.206 --> 00:39.507
someplace new.

00:41.509 --> 00:43.677
Or I could get in line earlier.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.246
Attaboy.

00:46.114 --> 00:48.316
I would have been on time
if that old homeless guy

00:48.416 --> 00:50.151
out in the parking garage
didn't heckle me.

00:50.251 --> 00:51.419
What the hell
did I just say?

00:51.519 --> 00:54.021
No more excuses. Yes, ma'am.

00:54.122 --> 00:55.756
It's just that
the old geezer's back

00:55.856 --> 00:57.758
begging for change and he didn't
take no for an answer.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.260
Would that be the "old geezer"

00:59.360 --> 01:00.694
with the snake
and the sword tattoo?

01:00.794 --> 01:02.563
I didn't pay attention. Clearly.

01:02.663 --> 01:03.864
Because if you had,
you would have noticed

01:03.964 --> 01:07.101
that tattoo says
4th Infantry Division.

01:07.201 --> 01:08.436
The old man was Army?

01:08.536 --> 01:10.371
Which means he deserves
some respect.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.773
And a couple of bucks.

01:19.113 --> 01:21.682
Look alive, soldier.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.920
Excuse me, sir?

01:27.020 --> 01:30.691
Hey, you all right?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.469
Oh, my God.

01:46.140 --> 01:47.708
Dial 911!

01:47.808 --> 01:49.109
Sheehan?

02:04.792 --> 02:06.594
911. What's your emergency?

02:06.694 --> 02:09.863
Hello? Hello?

02:43.297 --> 02:45.032
McGee, you're seeing this?

02:45.132 --> 02:47.568
Yeah, man.
This is unbelievable.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.903
Hey, McGee, what was that trick

02:50.003 --> 02:52.473
you told me about getting
your earbuds to work, again?

02:52.573 --> 02:54.775
Uh, hit "forget device,"
then "re-pair device."

02:54.875 --> 02:56.644
All right. Thank you.

02:58.346 --> 02:59.513
Still having problems?

02:59.613 --> 03:02.550
No, it's not me.
It's my dad in Japan.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.685
I made the mistake
of suggesting new earbuds,

03:04.785 --> 03:06.720
and now he texts me
every time they don't work.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.188
Trickle-down tech support.

03:08.289 --> 03:10.358
See, this is why I stopped
giving gadget advice

03:10.458 --> 03:11.559
to my extended family.

03:11.659 --> 03:12.760
Tim, you're missing it.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.262
Ooh, why? What-What's going on?

03:14.362 --> 03:15.329
I just saw a shadow.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.464
Friend or foe?

03:16.564 --> 03:18.299
Is somebody stealing packages

03:18.399 --> 03:19.467
from your front door again?

03:19.567 --> 03:21.569
What? Oh, no, I'm not, um...

03:21.669 --> 03:23.604
I'm not watching my,
uh, doorbell camera.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.606
No, we're watching
a live webcam feed

03:25.706 --> 03:29.310
of a bald eagle's nest
in the Yukon Territory.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.911
Look at that.

03:33.347 --> 03:36.617
Wow. Parker would be proud.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.519
He's the one that
gave us the idea.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.988
And now we can't stop watching.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.826
I can see why.
This is riveting drama.

03:45.926 --> 03:48.596
Right? Eggs are due to hatch
any minute, too.

03:48.696 --> 03:51.265
Now, bald eagle
incubation is 35 days

03:51.365 --> 03:52.400
and we're on day 37.

03:52.500 --> 03:53.834
And plot twist:

03:53.934 --> 03:55.536
the mom has been gone
for like three hours.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.237
Yeah. And we have no idea why.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.672
Or when she's gonna come back.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.508
Like, this is like
a matter of life or death.

04:00.608 --> 04:01.942
Why we can't afford
to look away.

04:02.042 --> 04:04.077
Yeah, life is so...

04:04.177 --> 04:05.879
unpredictable.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.915
Right, but you watching
isn't gonna change

04:08.015 --> 04:09.583
what's gonna happen
to those eggs.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.051
Well, it might.

04:11.151 --> 04:12.786
The positive energy that
we put out in the universe

04:12.886 --> 04:13.887
might affect the outcome.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.423
From three thousand miles away?

04:15.523 --> 04:16.924
It's called
the butterfly effect.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.125
Yeah, it's like science.

04:18.225 --> 04:19.092
If you stop watching,

04:19.192 --> 04:20.193
something bad could happen.

04:20.294 --> 04:21.629
Something bad did happen.

04:21.729 --> 04:23.631
We got a possible
bioterror attack

04:23.731 --> 04:25.299
across the river in Anacostia.

04:25.399 --> 04:26.534
Time to turn
the phones off

04:26.634 --> 04:27.535
and put these on.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.537
And check 'em for tears.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.808
I want this
whole block secured!

04:34.908 --> 04:38.111
This strip mall is now
a containment zone, understand?

04:38.211 --> 04:40.881
The only people
who get in need a badge,

04:40.981 --> 04:43.617
a hazmat suit, and a death wish.

04:43.717 --> 04:44.652
How about two
out of three?

04:44.752 --> 04:46.219
Special Agent Parker, NCIS.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.756
Martinez, MPD.
What are we
looking at, Cap?

04:48.856 --> 04:50.591
Oh, nothing good.

04:50.691 --> 04:53.461
Two MPD officers
responded to a 911 call

04:53.561 --> 04:55.095
from the Navy
recruitment center.

04:55.195 --> 04:58.265
They went inside and
reported multiple bodies.

04:58.366 --> 04:59.900
Alive?
No idea.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.169
Before the officers
could send a full report,

05:02.269 --> 05:03.571
the radio went dead.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.339
And my people
never came back out.

05:05.439 --> 05:08.342
Too fast to be some kind
of accidental gas leak.

05:08.442 --> 05:10.378
We're thinking airborne toxin.

05:10.478 --> 05:11.845
The deliberate kind.

05:11.945 --> 05:14.081
So we evacuated the area
and called for backup.

05:14.181 --> 05:16.283
All right, emergency response
team is right behind us.

05:16.384 --> 05:18.085
They'll coordinate from
out here while my team

05:18.185 --> 05:20.454
and I head inside to identify
the source of the threat.

05:20.554 --> 05:24.958
In that case, you better zip up
that space suit nice and tight.

05:25.058 --> 05:27.761
This place is a death zone.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.707
These people
dropped like stones.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.241
Yeah, but what did it?

05:42.410 --> 05:44.412
There's nothing coming
from the HVAC system,

05:44.512 --> 05:46.380
and the blowers are off.

05:48.281 --> 05:50.183
Oxygen levels are clear.

05:51.585 --> 05:52.886
I got a pulse here.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.722
It's weak, but she's alive.

05:55.623 --> 05:56.790
Same here.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.359
You two start moving
bodies outside

05:59.460 --> 06:00.994
into the decontamination zone.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.030
Knight and I
will check out back.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.164
On it.

06:17.611 --> 06:20.180
We found our hot zone.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.616
I'm counting at least
seven more victims.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.685
Including the two
first responders.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.019
Whatever these people
were breathing in

06:26.119 --> 06:27.320
must have been pretty dense

06:27.421 --> 06:28.989
to fill up an entire
parking garage.

06:29.089 --> 06:31.492
But I'm not showing
any airborne contaminants.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.393
Even at ground level.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.398
We've got a gas cylinder.

06:44.438 --> 06:47.407
Nozzle's wide open
and the gauge is at empty.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.809
Think we found our source.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.978
Oxygen levels are normal.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.847
Whatever was in that tank
must have dissipated by now.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.916
Not before causing real damage.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.360
I'll radio the med team,

07:07.461 --> 07:09.997
make sure they're ready
with extra gurneys.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.033
We're gonna need it.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.168
Just found victim number eight.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.677
Parker?

07:23.777 --> 07:25.546
Over here!

07:25.646 --> 07:28.916
Oh, what the...? Who are you?

07:29.016 --> 07:30.651
We're federal agents.
Don't move.

07:30.751 --> 07:31.785
Medical help is on the way.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.655
Medical help? For what?

07:38.025 --> 07:39.527
They're waking up.

07:39.627 --> 07:42.295
What the hell?

07:53.106 --> 07:54.441
What's the latest, Doc?

07:54.542 --> 07:56.176
The gassing victims
are all receiving

07:56.276 --> 08:00.180
emergency care and undergoing
rigorous medical evaluation.
And?

08:00.280 --> 08:01.549
And so far there appears

08:01.649 --> 08:03.551
to be no serious injuries.
That's the good news.

08:03.651 --> 08:04.885
So what's the bad news?

08:04.985 --> 08:07.020
Well, there appears
to be no injuries at all.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.455
No respiratory distress.

08:08.556 --> 08:11.158
No heart problems. No residual
effects from the gas,

08:11.258 --> 08:12.492
and everyone's
in perfect health.

08:12.593 --> 08:13.894
Why is that the bad news?

08:13.994 --> 08:16.496
Because the doctors have
no idea what happened.

08:16.597 --> 08:19.667
It's hard to diagnose a problem
when there's no symptoms.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.935
Preliminary blood tests
have come back negative

08:22.035 --> 08:25.606
for all common toxins,
chemicals, anesthetics.

08:25.706 --> 08:29.677
So whatever was used inside that
parking garage was uncommon.

08:29.777 --> 08:32.780
Exactly. And the unknown
is always scarier.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.648
And for all we know,
this could've been

08:34.748 --> 08:37.450
some kind of
a terrorist test run.

08:37.551 --> 08:38.986
You're not the only
one that thinks so.

08:39.086 --> 08:41.755
I've been on with NSA, DoD,
Homeland all morning.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.356
I was just telling Agent Parker,

08:43.456 --> 08:45.025
there have been no injuries
so far, Director.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.595
That may be, but we have to
assume that whoever executed

08:47.695 --> 08:48.796
this attack can do it again.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.463
And on a larger,
more deadly scale.

08:50.564 --> 08:52.600
NCIS needs to find out
who's responsible.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.134
Which means we need to find out

08:54.234 --> 08:56.203
what kind of a chemical weapon
we're dealing with.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.005
<i>Actually...</i>

08:58.105 --> 09:00.674
it was bovine tranquilizer.

09:00.774 --> 09:01.709
For cows?

09:01.809 --> 09:03.376
I have processed
the gas cylinder

09:03.476 --> 09:04.745
from the parking garage

09:04.845 --> 09:06.747
and found trace
amounts of xylazine.

09:06.847 --> 09:09.683
A sedative most
commonly used in cattle.

09:09.783 --> 09:12.152
So, veterinarians
use gas?
No.

09:12.252 --> 09:13.654
They use injections.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.590
Because xylazine is only
manufactured in liquid form.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.992
So how does a liquid
sedative become a gas?

09:19.092 --> 09:23.130
You mean a colorless, tasteless,
and slightly minty-smelling gas.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.331
If you say so.

09:24.431 --> 09:25.966
Well, someone clearly
developed a way

09:26.066 --> 09:27.234
to aerosolize the stuff.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.737
And let me tell you,
vaporization chemistry...

09:29.837 --> 09:31.338
no easy task.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.040
So we're looking for someone
that knows what they're doing.

09:33.140 --> 09:36.543
Xylazine is generally
not safe for humans.

09:36.644 --> 09:38.812
But the ppm ratio of this gas

09:38.912 --> 09:41.949
was specifically formulated
to knock a person out

09:42.049 --> 09:43.283
in under 90 seconds.

09:43.383 --> 09:44.818
Without causing any real harm.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.354
Why?
The million-dollar question.

09:47.454 --> 09:49.857
Who would want to create
the chaos and fear

09:49.957 --> 09:53.393
of a bioterror attack without
the usual death and destruction?

09:53.493 --> 09:54.928
Bad guys with a conscience?

09:55.028 --> 09:56.997
Or an even bigger plan. Exactly.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.566
Too bad there's nothing
in the Global Terrorism Database

09:59.667 --> 10:01.134
about cow tranquilizer.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.303
There weren't any
security cameras

10:03.403 --> 10:04.805
in the parking garage either.

10:04.905 --> 10:07.908
So we'll need another way
to identify said bad guys.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.245
Group text?
No.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.547
I get alerts every time
something new happens

10:14.648 --> 10:16.583
with the eagle eggs.

10:16.684 --> 10:17.751
Did the eggs hatch?

10:17.851 --> 10:20.087
Uh, no, but their
mother showed up.

10:20.187 --> 10:21.421
Which is a major relief.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.427
The father showed up.

10:27.527 --> 10:29.096
Oh, cool. That's fabulous.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.798
Did you know that
the male and the female

10:30.898 --> 10:32.666
take turns on sitting
on the eggs?

10:32.766 --> 10:35.002
Okay, bird boy.
You might want to dial down

10:35.102 --> 10:36.904
your notification settings
a little bit.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.772
Actually, that wasn't
a nest notification.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.273
That was Parker
from the hospital.

10:40.373 --> 10:41.574
NCIS has been cleared

10:41.675 --> 10:43.977
for questioning
the gassing victims.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.747
Text Parker and let him know
that I'm on my way.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.448
Except I forgot to turn
my phone back on

10:48.548 --> 10:50.117
after the hazmat operation.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.254
Uh-oh. All from my sister.

10:54.354 --> 10:55.388
Everything okay?

10:55.488 --> 10:56.456
I don't know.

10:56.556 --> 10:58.291
This just says "Call me."

10:58.391 --> 11:00.093
<i>Well, maybe next time</i>

11:00.193 --> 11:01.829
don't make it sound like
a family emergency

11:01.929 --> 11:05.465
if it's not actually
a family emergency.

11:05.565 --> 11:06.867
Love you, too. Bye.

11:06.967 --> 11:10.771
Sorry. My sister needs
a class in text etiquette.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.773
Sign my dad up
for that class.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.441
So, is everything okay?

11:14.541 --> 11:15.809
Yeah, turns out
my dad got into

11:15.909 --> 11:17.778
a bicycling accident
in Japan.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.747
He was fiddling
with his new earbuds

11:19.847 --> 11:22.149
when he veered off the path
and into a bamboo grove.

11:22.249 --> 11:24.918
Well, bamboo is a
good luck symbol.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.820
Well, he is lucky
that he only ended up

11:26.920 --> 11:28.421
with a compound fracture
on his left arm

11:28.521 --> 11:29.957
and he's gonna be fine.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.125
But you would think
a federal agent would understand

11:32.225 --> 11:34.094
the dangers
of distracted driving.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.262
Nobody's perfect.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.764
Yeah.

11:36.864 --> 11:39.032
So, it looks like we have...

11:39.132 --> 11:42.502
ten gas victims
in five different rooms?

11:42.602 --> 11:43.570
How do you want
to handle this?

11:43.670 --> 11:45.238
Divide and conquer?

11:46.039 --> 11:47.908
<i>This was an act of war.</i>

11:48.008 --> 11:50.210
A direct attack
on a U.S. Navy facility

11:50.310 --> 11:52.679
shows intention
to provoke a conflict.

11:52.780 --> 11:53.781
And you know this how?

11:53.881 --> 11:55.849
It's international law.

11:55.949 --> 11:59.286
Captain Boggs, did you see
anything in that garage

11:59.386 --> 12:00.520
that would be able to tell us

12:00.620 --> 12:02.255
who was responsible
for this attack?

12:04.324 --> 12:05.358
No.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.997
Ms. Quinlan,
uh, you said you were

12:10.097 --> 12:12.165
headed to the salon
in the morning?

12:12.265 --> 12:15.702
Yeah. Sorry, it's, um...

12:15.803 --> 12:17.470
been a day.

12:17.570 --> 12:18.939
You can call me Dorothy.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.841
Dorothy, did you
see anything unusual

12:20.941 --> 12:22.609
before you passed out?

12:22.709 --> 12:23.610
Not really.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.678
I mean, unless you count

12:25.779 --> 12:27.447
two guys in a white cargo van.

12:27.547 --> 12:28.448
What about them?

12:28.548 --> 12:29.983
Well, they sped off

12:30.083 --> 12:32.752
right before I started
feeling dizzy, but...

12:32.853 --> 12:34.021
I didn't get
a good look at them.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.588
Do you remember
anything else?

12:35.688 --> 12:37.257
Even the smallest detail?

12:37.357 --> 12:38.959
No. Because before I knew it,

12:39.059 --> 12:40.427
I woke up in this nightmare.

12:40.527 --> 12:41.728
Agents in hazmat suits,

12:41.829 --> 12:43.630
doctors treating us
like plague victims.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.698
And my phone broke
when I collapsed

12:45.799 --> 12:47.367
and now it's not working at all.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.003
Sorry, that's, that's my phone.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.905
I'm dealing with
some family issues.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.207
I know how that feels.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.978
I just want this day to end.

13:00.814 --> 13:03.183
Best day I had
in a long time.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.986
Clean bed, hot shower.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.721
And the food ain't bad either.

13:08.822 --> 13:11.158
Better than that horse meat
we got in 'Nam.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.760
Yeah, I just need to know
if you saw anything unusual

13:13.861 --> 13:16.663
in the parking garage
this morning.

13:16.763 --> 13:18.398
Ever since my
mortar-launching days,

13:18.498 --> 13:20.033
I'm a tad scatterbrained.

13:21.101 --> 13:24.237
That's why everybody
started calling me Shelly.

13:24.337 --> 13:28.741
Okay, I'm gonna give
you a minute.

13:28.842 --> 13:30.743
I promise I'm fine.

13:30.844 --> 13:32.612
It's just a little scrape.

13:32.712 --> 13:34.714
I know, I miss you, too,
honey bear.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.716
Uh, Mr. Billings,
the sooner we finish this,

13:36.816 --> 13:38.785
the sooner you can go
back to your family.

13:38.886 --> 13:42.089
And I promise I'll never
leave your side again.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.557
I love you, too, snookums.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.792
I'm sorry about that.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.194
I haven't seen my wife

13:47.294 --> 13:48.728
since I left the house
this morning, and...

13:48.828 --> 13:50.730
we're not usually apart
for this long.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.966
I picked up on that.

13:53.066 --> 13:55.402
Like I was saying, um...
The parking garage.

13:55.502 --> 13:58.071
Right. I was headed
to the hardware store

13:58.171 --> 14:00.673
to pick up a new toilet
flapper for the

14:00.773 --> 14:02.709
downstairs bathroom.
Uh-huh.

14:02.809 --> 14:05.545
And I never made it to my car...

14:05.645 --> 14:08.581
before, bam, I was
out like a light.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.183
I don't remember a thing.

14:10.283 --> 14:13.420
You know, my wife's
a hypnotherapist.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.222
Maybe she can access

14:15.322 --> 14:16.623
my repressed memories.

14:16.723 --> 14:17.857
I'll come back later.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.726
I got some other victims
to talk to.

14:19.826 --> 14:21.328
Hey, hon.

14:21.428 --> 14:23.796
Hey, where's that
police officer?

14:23.897 --> 14:25.632
Are you the cop looking
into the gas attack?

14:25.732 --> 14:27.734
NCIS. Is there something
wrong, sir?

14:27.834 --> 14:29.436
Hell yeah. I've been robbed.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.670
And you are...?

14:30.770 --> 14:32.405
George Barlow.
I'm a contractor.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.041
I was picking up tools
at the hardware store

14:34.141 --> 14:35.375
this morning
when I passed out.

14:35.475 --> 14:36.944
And when I did,
my keys and cell phone

14:37.044 --> 14:38.378
were securely
attached to my belt.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.113
And now they're missing?

14:40.213 --> 14:42.449
The terrorists that gassed that
parking garage stole my stuff.

14:42.549 --> 14:43.750
Calm down, Mr. Barlow.

14:43.850 --> 14:45.052
It's an awful lot of trouble

14:45.152 --> 14:46.686
for just a set of keys
and a cell phone.

14:46.786 --> 14:48.721
I mean, unless you've got access

14:48.821 --> 14:50.190
to government secrets
or something.

14:50.290 --> 14:54.261
Hey, buddy.
You ain't that far off.

14:56.796 --> 14:57.965
Wait a minute.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.566
The contractor
was being serious?

14:59.666 --> 15:01.468
Yeah, as it turns out,
George Barlow

15:01.568 --> 15:03.770
owns George's
Fish Fountain.

15:03.870 --> 15:06.339
It's a company that
installs aquariums

15:06.439 --> 15:10.077
and water features
into high-end homes in D.C.

15:10.177 --> 15:11.444
Look at this.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.547
"Trusted since 1993."

15:14.647 --> 15:15.915
Yeah, and that's the problem.

15:16.016 --> 15:18.018
See, George offers
an in-home, no-hassle

15:18.118 --> 15:21.054
maintenance program to his
clients and they trust him

15:21.154 --> 15:23.090
with their house keys
and alarm codes.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.891
Keys and alarm codes
that are now missing, huh?

15:24.992 --> 15:27.160
Yeah. Look at
George's client list.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.230
I recognize some of these names.

15:30.330 --> 15:33.633
Exactly. Politicians,
military contractors,

15:33.733 --> 15:35.468
high-ranking
military officers...

15:35.568 --> 15:36.669
High-value targets.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.105
And the keys to
their front doors

15:38.205 --> 15:41.308
are now in the hands
of bioterrorists.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.320
So our bioterrorists
are also thieves.

15:53.420 --> 15:57.090
They flooded the parking garage
with a specialized knockout gas,

15:57.190 --> 15:58.758
then stole keys
and alarm codes

15:58.858 --> 16:00.527
to multiple
private residences.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.396
Some of which belong to high-
ranking government officials.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.132
D.C. power players.

16:05.232 --> 16:07.000
Who are now potential targets.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.369
We've started notifying them
about the security threat.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.505
Good. Because we have
no idea what comes next.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.341
Our bioterrorists
could use their knockout gas

16:14.441 --> 16:16.009
for any number of crimes.

16:16.109 --> 16:19.012
Unfortunately, we still have
no leads on who's behind this.

16:19.112 --> 16:20.347
Other than a vague description

16:20.447 --> 16:22.082
about two men
in a white cargo van.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.451
Find 'em. Find out
what they're planning

16:24.551 --> 16:26.119
before it becomes
another headline.

16:26.219 --> 16:28.755
We'll keep you
in the loop.

16:28.855 --> 16:29.789
Agent Knight.

16:29.889 --> 16:30.790
Would you mind...

16:30.890 --> 16:32.625
staying for a moment, please?

16:35.662 --> 16:37.930
I heard about your father's
little mishap.

16:38.031 --> 16:39.432
Word travels fast.

16:39.532 --> 16:42.235
Well, the NCIS Far East office
is a tight-knit group.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.636
How's your dad holding up?

16:43.736 --> 16:44.904
He had surgery to reset
his broken bone.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.739
And I'm told
that he's doing well,

16:46.839 --> 16:48.608
but the doctors are going to
keep him overnight just in case.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.510
I'm glad to hear it.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.179
Tell him I send my best.

16:52.279 --> 16:53.880
I would, except I haven't

16:53.980 --> 16:55.515
actually spoken
to him personally.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.184
The, uh,
Japanese hospitals

16:57.284 --> 16:59.852
are pretty strict about
their no cell phone use.

16:59.952 --> 17:01.221
If you like,

17:01.321 --> 17:03.656
I could call and ask them
to make an exception.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.492
It's a perk of the office.

17:05.592 --> 17:08.095
You know my dad doesn't like
any special favors.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.096
True.

17:09.196 --> 17:10.530
But I'm asking you.

17:10.630 --> 17:14.901
Well, in that case, bring it on.

17:15.001 --> 17:15.935
Thank you, Director.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.637
You're welcome.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.476
Well, it must be nice to be rich

17:23.576 --> 17:24.744
and have your own,
uh, fountain guy.

17:24.844 --> 17:27.314
Oof. Lifestyles of
the rich and famous.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.282
More like the rich
and hunted. Oh.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.318
So, um, you called me down here.

17:31.418 --> 17:32.652
I'm hoping for good news.

17:32.752 --> 17:35.955
Yes, I did. Because after
having that truck

17:36.055 --> 17:37.624
towed from the strip mall's
parking garage,

17:37.724 --> 17:39.526
I was able to confirm

17:39.626 --> 17:42.061
that our "fountain guy"
was, indeed, the target.

17:42.162 --> 17:45.365
I found this gas flow controller
planted under his truck.

17:45.465 --> 17:46.499
And what does it do?

17:46.599 --> 17:47.767
Exactly what the
name implies.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.336
It controls the
flow of gas.

17:49.436 --> 17:52.239
One hose was attached to the
truck's ventilation system,

17:52.339 --> 17:55.842
the other hose was attached to
the tank of cow tranquilizer.

17:55.942 --> 17:57.777
And the tank was hidden
underneath the truck?

17:57.877 --> 18:01.181
Yes. Until a fitting failed
and the hose came loose.

18:01.281 --> 18:02.615
The tank rolled free,

18:02.715 --> 18:05.685
and instead of gassing
George in his truck...

18:05.785 --> 18:06.953
It filled up
the whole garage.

18:07.053 --> 18:08.721
My guess is, the
thief's original plan

18:08.821 --> 18:11.023
was to steal the
phone and keys,

18:11.124 --> 18:12.659
copy them, and then
return the items

18:12.759 --> 18:14.661
without George ever
realizing what hit him.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.863
Wow. Smart.
Complicated but smart.

18:16.963 --> 18:20.667
Yeah, but since the gas cylinder
accidentally broke free

18:20.767 --> 18:22.101
and caused a bioterror panic,

18:22.202 --> 18:23.903
the thief wasn't able
to do that last part.

18:24.003 --> 18:25.738
Well, that's
good work, Kasie.

18:25.838 --> 18:29.242
Yeah. But I am
not done yet.

18:29.342 --> 18:31.043
Because I also found

18:31.144 --> 18:34.113
a hair follicle in
one of the gas flow hoses.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.948
Left by our thief?

18:36.048 --> 18:37.684
Uh, not sure yet.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.820
I'm running the DNA
through the system now.

18:41.588 --> 18:42.855
Oh, looks like
you got a hit.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.758
Actually, that's...
It's not important.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.461
Uh, Kasie?

18:48.561 --> 18:50.363
Is that what I think it is?

18:50.463 --> 18:51.598
Maybe.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.099
Ever since you showed me
the nest,

18:53.200 --> 18:54.367
I can't look away.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.668
See? I told you, man.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.637
We got to send
all the positive energy.

18:57.737 --> 18:58.838
Every little bit helps.

18:58.938 --> 19:00.139
Mm-hmm.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.542
Ooh. Case in point...

19:02.642 --> 19:04.677
We got a hit
on our hair follicle.

19:06.379 --> 19:10.683
Phillip Legrand, 55.
A known thief wanted by the FBI.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.819
Wanted in connection
with the robberies

19:12.919 --> 19:15.087
of several high-end
homes across the country.

19:15.188 --> 19:17.957
And in every case, homeowners,
uh, slept through the robbery

19:18.057 --> 19:20.159
and woke up to their
jewelry and cash gone.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.362
And they all reported
their houses

19:22.462 --> 19:24.130
smelling "slightly minty."

19:24.231 --> 19:26.266
That's the, uh,
cow tranquilizer.

19:26.366 --> 19:29.669
Looks like Legrand moved
on to robbing the D.C. elite.

19:29.769 --> 19:32.539
Okay, thank you
for the feedback.

19:32.639 --> 19:34.006
Well, speaking
of the D.C. elite,

19:34.106 --> 19:36.643
Knight and I are still
notifying potential targets.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.878
Tell 'em to change their locks.
I am.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.247
They're not happy about it.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.714
They keep blaming NCIS

19:41.814 --> 19:43.450
and asking to
"speak to my manager."

19:43.550 --> 19:44.984
Luckily, uh, no one

19:45.084 --> 19:47.153
has reported any break-ins
or suspicious activity.

19:47.254 --> 19:48.621
You've talked to everybody
on the list?

19:48.721 --> 19:49.822
All but one.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.324
U.S. Senator Constance Miller

19:51.424 --> 19:52.559
is currently on a flight

19:52.659 --> 19:54.594
home from a diplomatic trip
to Ukraine.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.363
All right, get in touch
with her office on the Hill.

19:56.463 --> 19:58.865
Already did. The office said
she'll call back when she lands.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.367
Well, in the meantime,

20:00.467 --> 20:03.069
at least diplomatic flights
have extra security.

20:04.571 --> 20:06.072
We might have another problem.

20:06.172 --> 20:07.407
The office also said

20:07.507 --> 20:09.409
that she has a live-in maid
at her house.

20:09.509 --> 20:10.577
But every time I call,

20:10.677 --> 20:12.011
nobody answers.

20:12.111 --> 20:13.913
Sounds like we better
check out that house.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.857
Hello?

20:25.792 --> 20:28.795
I don't see any movement.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.531
I think I know why.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.900
We got a body.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.922
I think we found our maid.

20:56.022 --> 20:59.292
Got a faint pulse
and a shallow breath.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.093
She's been gassed.

21:01.193 --> 21:03.430
Yeah, Legrand.

21:03.530 --> 21:04.564
He's definitely been here.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.836
And someone still is.

21:28.187 --> 21:30.690
Federal agents!
Hands up!

21:31.958 --> 21:33.660
Turn around slowly!

21:36.696 --> 21:38.631
Who are you?

21:38.731 --> 21:40.600
Agent Knight, don't shoot.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.635
Dorothy?

21:55.415 --> 21:56.883
You have this all wrong.

21:56.983 --> 22:00.019
You broke into the home
of a United States senator.

22:00.119 --> 22:01.621
This is all a misunderstanding.

22:01.721 --> 22:04.190
Using stolen keys
and alarm codes.

22:04.290 --> 22:06.593
Which makes this breaking and
entering <i>and</i> felony theft.

22:06.693 --> 22:09.696
Question is:
do we need to add charges

22:09.796 --> 22:12.632
for committing an act
of terrorism?

22:12.732 --> 22:13.700
What?

22:13.800 --> 22:15.334
You lied to me
at the hospital.

22:15.435 --> 22:17.770
There were no "guys in
a white cargo van."

22:17.870 --> 22:19.372
You planted the gas.

22:19.472 --> 22:22.509
And accidentally gassed
yourself in the process.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.678
We understand plenty.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.447
Lucky for you,
we also understand

22:27.547 --> 22:29.048
that you weren't
working alone.

22:29.148 --> 22:31.183
You were working
for Phillip Legrand.

22:31.283 --> 22:33.219
We might be able to

22:33.319 --> 22:35.522
drop those terrorism
charges if...

22:35.622 --> 22:38.458
you lead us to your boss.

22:39.992 --> 22:41.394
He's not my boss, okay?

22:41.494 --> 22:43.129
You don't understand.

22:43.229 --> 22:45.297
Phillip Legrand is my father.

22:46.433 --> 22:48.501
And he's being held hostage.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.670
If I don't deliver
the hard drive from that safe,

22:50.770 --> 22:53.205
whoever has my dad
will kill him.

22:55.842 --> 22:59.812
Well, maybe we don't understand
as much as we thought.

22:59.912 --> 23:01.013
So you'll help me?

23:01.113 --> 23:02.882
As long as you
tell us everything.

23:02.982 --> 23:04.617
Starting with your father.

23:05.685 --> 23:06.886
He was a chemistry teacher

23:06.986 --> 23:09.288
before he was
a professional thief.

23:09.388 --> 23:10.757
But I didn't know what
he did for a living

23:10.857 --> 23:12.825
until a few years back
when he sold the house,

23:12.925 --> 23:15.327
bought a camper van, and started
traveling around the country.

23:15.428 --> 23:16.496
To rob houses.

23:16.596 --> 23:18.264
He called it early retirement.

23:18.364 --> 23:19.699
I called it
a way to avoid

23:19.799 --> 23:21.868
student loans I'll never
be able to pay back.

23:21.968 --> 23:24.403
So... I joined him.

23:24.504 --> 23:28.074
Breaking the law
didn't bother you?

23:28.174 --> 23:29.576
Of course it did.

23:29.676 --> 23:31.944
But we're not violent criminals.

23:32.044 --> 23:33.446
My dad has a strict code.

23:33.546 --> 23:35.448
We only steal from
people who can afford it.

23:35.548 --> 23:36.616
We only take enough
to travel around

23:36.716 --> 23:37.884
together in
our camper van.

23:37.984 --> 23:39.251
And nobody ever...

23:39.351 --> 23:40.920
<i>ever</i> gets hurt.

23:41.020 --> 23:43.422
You gas innocent people.

23:45.124 --> 23:47.259
I know.

23:47.359 --> 23:49.028
It's wrong.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.502
And here we are.

23:55.602 --> 23:57.269
Here <i>you</i> are.

23:57.369 --> 23:58.605
Where's your dad?

23:58.705 --> 24:01.340
I told you, he was kidnapped.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.875
Last week, I got
an anonymous text

24:02.975 --> 24:05.011
from someone saying
they knew we were thieves.

24:05.111 --> 24:06.746
Wanted to hire us to pull a job.

24:06.846 --> 24:09.048
And how did they find you?
I have no idea.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.083
But working for someone else
goes against our code,

24:11.183 --> 24:12.485
so I turned it down.

24:12.585 --> 24:15.755
And I'm guessing, uh,
that didn't go too well?

24:15.855 --> 24:18.591
Next day, I found
our camper van trashed

24:18.691 --> 24:20.927
and my father missing.

24:21.027 --> 24:23.329
Then I got another text
from the same person.

24:23.429 --> 24:26.499
This time, a new offer.

24:26.599 --> 24:29.235
Steal the hard drive from
Senator Miller's safe...

24:29.335 --> 24:31.871
or my father dies.

24:33.506 --> 24:35.642
And you didn't call the police?

24:35.742 --> 24:38.377
I swear I'm telling
the truth now.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.747
A-And I can prove it.

24:41.781 --> 24:44.884
As long as you can fix
my cell phone.

24:45.818 --> 24:49.088
Shattered screen,
total touch malfunction.

24:49.188 --> 24:51.223
Sounds bad.
Not really.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.425
I can usually fix these
things in under a minute.

24:53.526 --> 24:56.896
But you need, like,
spare parts and tools?

24:56.996 --> 24:59.699
Yeah, I got 'em
all right here.

25:01.367 --> 25:04.971
Federal agent,
best-selling author,

25:05.071 --> 25:06.673
and a smartphone repairman?

25:06.773 --> 25:11.043
Mm-hmm.
Delilah is a serial
gadget killer.

25:11.143 --> 25:13.713
Buttons, screens, batteries...

25:13.813 --> 25:16.348
I'm always fixing
something, you know?

25:22.154 --> 25:23.422
Hear from your dad?

25:23.522 --> 25:25.391
No, I wish. It's my sister.

25:25.491 --> 25:27.059
She heard from him?
Not yet.

25:27.159 --> 25:29.161
But I'm letting her know that
Vance is calling in a favor.

25:29.261 --> 25:30.963
All right, here we go.

25:31.063 --> 25:32.799
We can access
the phone's messaging app.

25:32.899 --> 25:34.767
Dorothy said that
the threatening text messages

25:34.867 --> 25:36.268
were coming from
an unregistered number.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.870
So, maybe a burner phone?

25:37.970 --> 25:40.106
Yep. Here's the text thread
about killing her father.

25:40.206 --> 25:41.908
Just like she said.

25:42.008 --> 25:42.942
Story checks out.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.111
Question is: do we believe her?

25:45.211 --> 25:47.780
You think Dorothy made all
this up, faked the texts?

25:47.880 --> 25:50.983
I think she's
a professional criminal. True.

25:51.083 --> 25:52.719
Would be nice to have
physical evidence

25:52.819 --> 25:53.853
of a kidnapping.
Mm-hmm.

25:53.953 --> 25:57.089
We agree. Just
finished processing

25:57.189 --> 25:58.557
Dorothy's camper van.

25:58.658 --> 26:01.527
We found signs of struggle
and traces of blood.

26:01.628 --> 26:03.029
A match to Phillip Legrand?

26:03.129 --> 26:05.297
It looks like, uh,
Dorothy was telling the truth.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.332
He was taken.

26:06.432 --> 26:07.800
Yeah, but who did it?

26:07.900 --> 26:09.235
I mean, back-tracing
a burn phone

26:09.335 --> 26:10.837
isn't gonna get us anywhere.

26:10.937 --> 26:13.572
No, we got to find out who
wanted that, uh, hard drive.

26:13.673 --> 26:14.941
Yeah, but in order to do that,

26:15.041 --> 26:16.508
we need to know what's
on the hard drive.

26:16.609 --> 26:17.543
Good luck
getting a U.S. senator

26:17.644 --> 26:19.211
to reveal what
she has locked

26:19.311 --> 26:21.347
in her hidden safe.
Well, I'm not making that call.

26:21.447 --> 26:22.915
Me neither.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.751
She's definitely gonna
want to "speak to a manager."

26:24.851 --> 26:27.553
I think we need to go
higher up than that.

26:31.724 --> 26:32.959
Please help yourself
to some traditional

26:33.059 --> 26:35.394
varenyky dumplings,
Director Vance.

26:35.494 --> 26:36.796
There was really no need
to go through

26:36.896 --> 26:38.264
all this trouble,
Senator Miller.

26:38.364 --> 26:40.867
Baked goods are the least
I can do after NCIS

26:40.967 --> 26:42.434
prevented a robbery
in my own home.

26:42.534 --> 26:44.070
Pastry, Agent Parker?

26:44.170 --> 26:46.405
Sure.
One of the perks of being
on the Senate Committee

26:46.505 --> 26:48.540
for Foreign Relations
is traveling

26:48.641 --> 26:50.142
and trying exotic desserts.

26:50.242 --> 26:51.644
Woman after my own heart.

26:52.812 --> 26:55.715
But I'm pretty sure
you're not here for sweets.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.984
You're here to find out
what's in my safe, right?

26:58.084 --> 26:59.318
Uh, we have no intention

26:59.418 --> 27:00.887
of violating your privacy,
Senator Miller.

27:00.987 --> 27:03.389
NCIS only needs
a general idea

27:03.489 --> 27:04.791
of what's on
your hard drive

27:04.891 --> 27:06.993
in order to find out
who wanted it stolen.

27:07.093 --> 27:10.096
Relax. I can do a lot better
than a general idea.

27:10.196 --> 27:12.164
I'll show you
the whole damn thing.

27:12.264 --> 27:14.233
Follow me.

27:16.903 --> 27:18.705
The hard drive is
nothing more than a backup

27:18.805 --> 27:21.507
of my personal
photo library.

27:21.607 --> 27:23.275
I only keep it in this safe

27:23.375 --> 27:25.144
in case the house burns down.

27:27.814 --> 27:30.717
It's just pictures of...

27:31.884 --> 27:35.421
...family, friends, vacations.

27:35.521 --> 27:36.622
Campaign events.

27:36.723 --> 27:38.825
And dessert selfies.

27:38.925 --> 27:40.793
They're valuable to me
but hardly worth stealing.

27:40.893 --> 27:43.229
Well, obviously there's
something about

27:43.329 --> 27:44.964
these photos
that's important.

27:45.064 --> 27:46.833
Well, I can't imagine
what that would be, but

27:46.933 --> 27:49.068
I'm happy to make NCIS a copy.

27:49.168 --> 27:50.536
We would appreciate that.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.206
The hospital's finally
getting back to me

27:54.306 --> 27:55.341
about Agent Knight's father.

27:55.441 --> 27:56.608
Uh, Senator,

27:56.709 --> 27:57.977
my apologies,
I need to take this.

27:58.077 --> 27:59.445
Of course.
I'll get started on that copy.

27:59.545 --> 28:00.947
Thank you.

28:02.381 --> 28:05.852
Glad someone's enjoying
those traditional varenykys.

28:05.952 --> 28:07.286
Frankly, I was
a bit disappointed.

28:07.386 --> 28:10.522
Well, whoever said that
these were traditional lied.

28:10.622 --> 28:12.558
These are baked, not boiled.

28:12.658 --> 28:13.625
You know your pastries.

28:13.726 --> 28:15.294
Mm, I have a sweet tooth.

28:15.394 --> 28:17.163
Is that all that's sweet?

28:19.498 --> 28:20.733
Again, Senator, my apologies.

28:20.833 --> 28:22.268
I need Agent Parker
for a moment.

28:27.606 --> 28:29.508
Everything good in Japan?

28:29.608 --> 28:33.212
No. There's been
a complication.

28:33.312 --> 28:35.714
I don't understand, Robin.
He was fine.

28:35.815 --> 28:37.984
How did this happen?

28:39.518 --> 28:41.653
Okay. Okay, just...

28:41.754 --> 28:43.322
Yeah, just...

28:43.422 --> 28:46.725
Okay, fine, just call me back
if anything changes.

28:46.826 --> 28:48.660
Yeah, I love you, too.

28:50.562 --> 28:53.032
Jess, hey, I just heard.
What happened?

28:53.132 --> 28:54.533
I wish I knew.

28:54.633 --> 28:56.268
One minute my dad was
recovering from a broken arm,

28:56.368 --> 28:57.669
and the next minute

28:57.770 --> 28:59.071
he's having a hard time
breathing, and now

28:59.171 --> 29:01.440
he is now unconscious
and on a ventilator.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.175
Was it a bad drug reaction?

29:03.275 --> 29:04.543
The doctors in Japan

29:04.643 --> 29:06.278
think it's some kind
of secondary infection.

29:06.378 --> 29:08.514
Well, that's gonna require
emergency surgery, ASAP.

29:08.614 --> 29:11.017
Yeah, he's going in now.

29:11.117 --> 29:12.551
But the doctors also told Robin

29:12.651 --> 29:13.820
that if they don't find
the problem soon,

29:13.920 --> 29:15.988
that my dad might...

29:17.589 --> 29:18.891
Okay, okay, all right, hey.

29:18.991 --> 29:20.392
How can I help?
What do you need?

29:20.492 --> 29:22.929
I don't know.

29:23.029 --> 29:24.696
My sister got me a plane ticket
that leaves

29:24.797 --> 29:26.565
for Tokyo tonight.
That's good.

29:26.665 --> 29:28.400
It's a 15-hour plane ride,
so by the time I get there,

29:28.500 --> 29:30.002
my dad might already...

29:30.102 --> 29:32.571
No, Jess, you can't think
like that.
I know.

29:32.671 --> 29:35.607
I just feel useless right now.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.011
I understand.

29:40.012 --> 29:41.914
Trust me.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.887
Tell me you got something
on our kidnappers, Kasie.

29:47.987 --> 29:50.857
I could really use some good
news about someone's father.

29:50.957 --> 29:53.159
You and me both,
except I don't have any.

29:53.259 --> 29:54.894
There was nothing in
Dorothy's camper van

29:54.994 --> 29:56.896
that can tell us
who took her dad.

29:56.996 --> 29:58.330
And the photos
from Senator Miller?

29:58.430 --> 30:00.666
I've been scanning through
her libraries for anything

30:00.766 --> 30:03.002
that might tell us who wanted
this hard drive.

30:03.102 --> 30:06.172
But other than the fact that
she enjoys travel and...

30:06.272 --> 30:09.441
enjoys dessert,
nothing stands out so far.

30:09.541 --> 30:10.977
Somebody wants these photos.

30:11.077 --> 30:12.744
And they want them
pretty badly.

30:12.845 --> 30:13.980
Our kidnapper just sent

30:14.080 --> 30:16.515
another text to Dorothy's phone.

30:16.615 --> 30:19.118
We're on the clock. Yes.

30:19.218 --> 30:21.653
And right now the only way
to find the kidnapper

30:21.753 --> 30:22.654
would be to give them

30:22.754 --> 30:23.956
what they want.

30:24.056 --> 30:25.457
Let Dorothy deliver
the hard drive?

30:25.557 --> 30:26.993
And lead us to the bad guys.

30:27.093 --> 30:28.527
Yeah, that would mean
that we would have to trust

30:28.627 --> 30:31.864
a known criminal who's facing
jail time for felony theft.

30:31.964 --> 30:33.465
You think Dorothy
would try to escape?

30:33.565 --> 30:34.700
I think it's a risk.

30:37.736 --> 30:39.671
It's a risk we might
have to take.

30:39.771 --> 30:42.441
Our kidnapper has started
sending photos.

30:53.752 --> 30:55.521
Are you sure
this is gonna work?

30:55.621 --> 30:57.089
Well, trading the hard drive
for your father

30:57.189 --> 30:58.424
was always the plan, right?

30:58.524 --> 31:00.226
Yes. But that was before.

31:00.326 --> 31:03.395
If the kidnapper finds out
NCIS is now involved...

31:03.495 --> 31:05.131
they'll kill my dad.

31:05.231 --> 31:06.698
We're gonna do everything we can

31:06.798 --> 31:09.501
to make sure that doesn't
happen, I promise.

31:10.302 --> 31:13.239
Why do you care so much
about saving a wanted criminal?

31:13.339 --> 31:16.175
Because my dad taught me
a code, too.

31:16.275 --> 31:19.078
Help those in need
every chance you get.

31:23.849 --> 31:25.751
Jess.

31:27.619 --> 31:28.620
You all right?

31:28.720 --> 31:30.356
Yeah.

31:33.025 --> 31:35.161
It's the kidnapper.

31:36.328 --> 31:38.330
He wants you to meet him
at 11 South King Street

31:38.430 --> 31:40.332
and wait for further instructions.

31:40.432 --> 31:41.733
I'll run the address.

31:41.833 --> 31:43.735
You don't have to.
It's an old office building

31:43.835 --> 31:46.238
my dad and I use
to stash our stolen goods.

31:50.009 --> 31:51.610
Did I forget to mention that?

31:51.710 --> 31:54.246
Why would the kidnapper
want you to go there?

31:54.346 --> 31:55.547
I don't know.

31:55.647 --> 31:57.149
Well, think harder.

31:57.249 --> 32:00.486
This is how we help your father.

32:00.586 --> 32:03.622
Their stash house is an
abandoned office complex.

32:03.722 --> 32:04.823
Dorothy was right.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.625
It should be easy
enough to stake out

32:06.725 --> 32:08.194
while we send her inside.

32:08.294 --> 32:10.997
McGee and I will take
the west, uh, entrance.

32:11.097 --> 32:12.764
I'll take the east.

32:12.864 --> 32:16.902
All right. Here is your copy of
the hard drive to use as bait.

32:17.003 --> 32:18.637
Is the actual data on here?

32:18.737 --> 32:20.539
With some added security.

32:20.639 --> 32:23.609
What's that mean?
What if something goes wrong?

32:23.709 --> 32:25.111
Well, the three of us
are gonna be in contact

32:25.211 --> 32:26.312
with you at all times,

32:26.412 --> 32:27.980
using earpieces.

32:28.080 --> 32:30.316
Everything will be okay.
Just stick to the plan.

32:30.416 --> 32:32.084
About that.

32:32.184 --> 32:34.853
Where's Agent Knight?
I thought she was part of this.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.555
I am.

32:36.655 --> 32:39.658
Jess, I thought you were
getting on a plane.

32:39.758 --> 32:40.892
Change of plans.

32:40.993 --> 32:42.995
What about your dad?

32:43.095 --> 32:45.564
There's nothing
I can do to help him.

32:45.664 --> 32:48.100
Here is where I can help.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.539
You don't have to do this.

32:54.773 --> 32:57.176
It's what my dad would do.

33:06.618 --> 33:08.354
McGEE: It's all quiet
on our side of the building.

33:08.454 --> 33:09.488
How about you?

33:09.588 --> 33:10.522
Nothing here.

33:10.622 --> 33:12.158
Anything from inside yet?

33:12.258 --> 33:13.859
How you doing, Dorothy?

33:13.959 --> 33:15.994
I'm good. I-I think.

33:16.095 --> 33:17.696
Any word from our kidnapper?

33:17.796 --> 33:20.399
I texted him that I'm here.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.668
But still no reply.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.638
So, what do I do now?

33:26.738 --> 33:29.775
Well, he said to await
further instructions, so...

33:29.875 --> 33:30.842
we wait.

33:30.942 --> 33:31.843
If you say so.

33:31.943 --> 33:33.112
Stick to the plan.

33:33.212 --> 33:34.346
Got it.

33:34.446 --> 33:36.182
I'm headed into the area
my dad and I

33:36.282 --> 33:37.316
use as a workroom.

33:37.416 --> 33:39.785
See anything out
of the ordinary?

33:42.388 --> 33:44.056
Just a bunch of stolen stuff.

33:44.156 --> 33:47.193
That my dad and I
are totally going to return.

33:47.293 --> 33:48.227
Yes...

33:48.327 --> 33:49.895
you totally will.

33:52.331 --> 33:53.965
Wait.

33:56.502 --> 33:57.903
There's a note on the table.

33:58.003 --> 33:58.870
What does it say?

33:58.970 --> 34:00.872
You guys better get in here.

34:00.972 --> 34:01.873
Like, now.

34:01.973 --> 34:03.075
Hurry, please.

34:03.175 --> 34:04.310
McGEE:
Sounds like she's panicking.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.112
Everyone move now!

34:14.686 --> 34:16.255
Dorothy?
In here.

34:16.355 --> 34:17.889
Hurry!

34:22.161 --> 34:23.495
Dorothy?

34:26.232 --> 34:28.167
What the hell is going on?

34:33.372 --> 34:34.706
Ask them.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.443
We're being watched.

34:37.543 --> 34:38.977
By who?

34:39.077 --> 34:40.546
Whoever wrote this note.

34:44.650 --> 34:46.084
You guys hear that sound?

34:52.724 --> 34:54.693
It's the gas. Go. Go...

34:54.793 --> 34:56.662
Knight, Knight.
I got you, I got you.

35:02.168 --> 35:03.902
I'm sorry, Agent Parker.

35:05.003 --> 35:07.173
I had to do what the note said.

35:16.515 --> 35:18.317
Hello?

35:18.417 --> 35:19.485
Smart girl.

35:19.585 --> 35:20.519
I did what you asked.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.221
Now where is my father?

35:22.321 --> 35:24.790
Bring the hard drive
to Rock Creek Park.

35:24.890 --> 35:26.592
The Old Quarry Trailhead.

35:26.692 --> 35:27.993
And hurry.

35:28.093 --> 35:30.529
Daddy dearest
won't wait forever.

35:47.045 --> 35:48.414
Hello?

35:48.514 --> 35:50.249
Help.

35:50.349 --> 35:51.750
Dad?

35:57.289 --> 35:59.157
Dad?

36:00.859 --> 36:01.893
Dorothy.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.164
Dad!
Dor...

36:06.265 --> 36:07.966
Dorothy...
Are you okay?

36:08.066 --> 36:09.835
What-what did they do to you?

36:09.935 --> 36:11.770
Where's the hard drive?

36:13.104 --> 36:14.473
Who the hell are you?

36:14.573 --> 36:17.243
I'm the man asking for that
hard drive one last time.

36:18.310 --> 36:19.711
Take it.

36:19.811 --> 36:22.113
Now leave us alone.
It's over.

36:23.249 --> 36:24.883
Not yet.

36:24.983 --> 36:26.252
What the hell
are you doing?

36:26.352 --> 36:28.554
We-we had a deal.
I gave you the hard drive!

36:28.654 --> 36:30.889
And I let your father live.

36:30.989 --> 36:32.458
Just long enough
to get what I want.

36:32.558 --> 36:33.692
Yeah.

36:33.792 --> 36:35.261
NCIS warned me
this would happen.

36:35.361 --> 36:37.663
Probably should've listened
to the good guys.

36:37.763 --> 36:38.897
Who said I didn't?

36:38.997 --> 36:40.165
NCIS.

36:44.603 --> 36:46.538
Drop your weapon, hands up.

36:47.739 --> 36:49.308
I told them about
the gas my dad and I

36:49.408 --> 36:50.709
keep at that office complex.

36:50.809 --> 36:52.143
Instead of
a tranquilizer,

36:52.244 --> 36:54.546
I opened a harmless tank
of compressed air.

36:54.646 --> 36:56.782
We had a feeling
you might be watching.

37:00.151 --> 37:01.186
Are you okay?

37:01.287 --> 37:03.054
Will be.

37:11.162 --> 37:15.200
Nate Billings
of Alexandria, Virginia.

37:16.602 --> 37:19.671
It's not your real name
or your real address.

37:19.771 --> 37:21.139
Outside of a fake ID

37:21.239 --> 37:24.376
and a professionally
Photoshopped family photo,

37:24.476 --> 37:26.478
you don't exist.

37:26.578 --> 37:28.380
Which either
makes you a ghost...

37:28.480 --> 37:29.848
Or a spy.

37:31.016 --> 37:33.885
A spy that got a thief
to do his dirty work for him.

37:33.985 --> 37:35.621
But you didn't
fully trust Dorothy

37:35.721 --> 37:37.188
to steal that
hard drive, did you?

37:37.289 --> 37:38.390
So you followed her

37:38.490 --> 37:39.858
to make sure she did
what you said.

37:39.958 --> 37:41.259
That's why you were
in the parking garage

37:41.360 --> 37:43.362
when the gas was
accidentally released.

37:43.462 --> 37:44.463
Explains a lot.

37:44.563 --> 37:45.631
McGEE:
What it doesn't explain

37:45.731 --> 37:46.932
is why you went
to all this trouble

37:47.032 --> 37:48.734
for a hard drive
filled with

37:48.834 --> 37:50.869
seemingly worthless photos.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.639
Who do you work for?

37:54.873 --> 37:56.241
It's time to call a lawyer.

37:56.342 --> 37:59.210
That's your right.
You got a number?

37:59.311 --> 38:01.380
Try the Russian embassy.

38:09.187 --> 38:11.256
This guy is
working for Russia?

38:11.357 --> 38:13.625
Of course, we can't prove that.
Not officially.

38:13.725 --> 38:16.528
But within hours of calling
the Russian embassy,

38:16.628 --> 38:18.597
they filed extradition papers.

38:18.697 --> 38:20.165
Which means that
"Nate Billings"

38:20.265 --> 38:22.934
is now in the custody
of the U.S. State Department.

38:23.034 --> 38:25.203
And let me guess, they're not
letting us talk to him.

38:25.303 --> 38:28.407
No. Last thing the State wants
is more bad blood with Russia.

38:28.507 --> 38:29.775
Our best lead is gone.

38:29.875 --> 38:31.076
Along with any chance
of finding out

38:31.176 --> 38:34.079
who wanted my photos or why.

38:34.179 --> 38:35.180
I'm afraid so.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.916
That's unfortunate.
Of course,

38:38.016 --> 38:40.686
we'll let you know if any
new information comes to light.

38:41.687 --> 38:42.988
Thank you, Director.

38:43.088 --> 38:44.289
Mm-hmm.

38:44.390 --> 38:46.592
And in the meantime,
Agent Parker,

38:46.692 --> 38:47.859
I trust you'll let me know

38:47.959 --> 38:49.728
where I can get
a proper varenyky.

38:52.030 --> 38:54.733
Gentlemen.
Mm-hmm.

38:59.004 --> 39:02.140
A "proper varenyky"?
Is that a euphemism?

39:02.240 --> 39:04.776
It is now.

39:05.744 --> 39:08.013
Oh, good. You're both here.

39:08.113 --> 39:10.181
Can we help you,
Ms. Hines?
Maybe.

39:10.281 --> 39:12.984
I finished processing
Senator Miller's photo libraries

39:13.084 --> 39:14.119
and I might have found

39:14.219 --> 39:15.887
a connection
to the Russians.

39:15.987 --> 39:18.256
Do these three people
look familiar?

39:20.125 --> 39:22.494
That's Delilah's former TA.

39:22.594 --> 39:23.995
Evelyn Shaw.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.766
And the other two
are Renée and John Watts.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.635
Your ex's kid had

39:29.735 --> 39:31.903
a run-in with them.

39:32.003 --> 39:33.872
We've recently arrested
all three of these people

39:33.972 --> 39:36.174
for being Russian
sleeper spies.

39:36.274 --> 39:38.910
Turns out, they were
active volunteers

39:39.010 --> 39:42.080
on Senator Miller's
last reelection campaign.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.183
And what does this prove?

39:45.283 --> 39:46.184
Technically...

39:46.284 --> 39:48.820
nothing.
Four Russian spies

39:48.920 --> 39:50.155
in as many months,

39:50.255 --> 39:52.123
all with an interest
in the same U.S. senator?

39:52.223 --> 39:53.992
That doesn't sound
like a coincidence.

39:54.092 --> 39:55.827
Sounds like we need
to keep digging.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.433
Yes. But quietly.

40:01.533 --> 40:04.503
Until NCIS has something
that we can prove.

40:10.576 --> 40:13.244
Thank you, Agent Knight.

40:13.344 --> 40:14.746
First time anyone's
ever thanked me

40:14.846 --> 40:16.247
for handing them
over to the FBI.

40:16.347 --> 40:19.384
I meant for saving
my dad's life.

40:21.086 --> 40:23.922
I'd rather face jail time
than lose him forever.

40:26.057 --> 40:27.859
I know how you feel.

40:40.071 --> 40:42.340
Hey. Anything new on your dad?

40:42.440 --> 40:44.743
Uh, he is out of surgery.

40:44.843 --> 40:46.478
And now I'm just waiting
for the doctors

40:46.578 --> 40:47.646
to call with an update.

40:47.746 --> 40:48.980
How about you?

40:49.080 --> 40:50.716
Any updates on your eggs?

40:50.816 --> 40:53.418
Oh, they are not
eggs anymore.

40:56.488 --> 40:58.824
Okay.

40:58.924 --> 41:00.191
That's pretty cute.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.728
Hey, all that, uh,
positive energy paid off.

41:02.828 --> 41:04.262
Yeah.

41:04.362 --> 41:06.632
Let's just hope it travels
further than the Yukon.

41:06.732 --> 41:08.133
Oh, it does.

41:08.233 --> 41:10.268
I just got an update
from the hospital in Japan.

41:10.368 --> 41:11.469
How?

41:11.570 --> 41:12.571
I told them I was
your dad's primary care

41:12.671 --> 41:13.939
physician here
in the States.

41:14.039 --> 41:15.874
It turns out the doctors
found wound botulism

41:15.974 --> 41:17.175
in your dad's arm.

41:17.275 --> 41:18.644
Apparently, after
the bike accident,

41:18.744 --> 41:20.512
some toxic spores
from the dirt

41:20.612 --> 41:22.948
got into the compound fracture
and spread. It's rare.
