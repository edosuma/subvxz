44:23.759 --> 44:25.258
Bridge.

44:27.300 --> 44:29.592
Dad.

44:32.425 --> 44:34.009
I'm sorry.

44:35.634 --> 44:39.592
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I did this.

44:39.675 --> 44:41.550
I did this,
all of it.

44:43.759 --> 44:45.967
- Stop.
- I was so scared.

44:46.051 --> 44:47.634
- So fucking scared.
- It's okay.

44:50.926 --> 44:52.300
Will you get help?

45:04.300 --> 45:08.967
I don't want to find you dead
in some parking lot.

45:10.675 --> 45:12.383
Because that's
where all of this is going.

45:12.467 --> 45:14.342
One day
I will just get a call,

45:14.425 --> 45:16.383
and you'll be dead,
like your friend.

45:37.217 --> 45:39.634
-  You okay?

45:39.717 --> 45:41.051
Yeah?

45:41.134 --> 45:42.842
Oh, fuck.

45:45.717 --> 45:47.508
Oh, thank God.

46:20.842 --> 46:22.884
- It's okay. I'm fine.
- Okay.

46:37.092 --> 46:38.842
Come on.

46:40.258 --> 46:42.467
How do you propose
that we dispose

46:42.550 --> 46:44.300
of these bodies?

46:44.383 --> 46:46.634
I'd say--
I'd say cut them up.

46:46.717 --> 46:49.217
Identifiable parts
in the ocean

46:49.300 --> 46:51.508
and the rest
maybe in the backyard.
