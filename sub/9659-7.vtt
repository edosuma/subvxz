00:01.128 --> 00:03.209
<i>Previously on The Amazing Race,</i>

00:03.291 --> 00:05.850
<i>seven teams raced
to Yerevan, Armenia.</i>

00:05.851 --> 00:08.570
<i>At the Detour,
Burnie and Ashley felt the heat...</i>

00:08.571 --> 00:09.730
It's burning.
-OK. Are you OK?

00:09.731 --> 00:11.680
Yeah. My curling iron
does worse than this.

00:11.681 --> 00:13.450
<i>..while Tyler and Korey
were stranded.</i>

00:13.451 --> 00:15.370
Everyone's gone.
-We're all alone.

00:15.371 --> 00:16.610
It's over.

00:16.611 --> 00:18.290
<i>With an Express Pass in play...</i>

00:18.291 --> 00:20.850
It'd be nice to get first
and get that Express Pass.

00:20.851 --> 00:23.210
<i>..Sheri and Cole
reached the Roadblock</i>

00:23.211 --> 00:24.970
<i>right behind the leaders,
Brodie and Kurt.</i>

00:24.971 --> 00:27.370
So, it's literally just whoever
finishes it first

00:27.371 --> 00:28.770
between your mom and Kurt.

00:28.771 --> 00:30.730
<i>Kurt changed oil in a jiffy...</i>

00:30.731 --> 00:32.049
Yes! Yes, baby!

00:32.051 --> 00:33.730
<i>..helping him and Brodie
to win the leg.</i>

00:33.731 --> 00:35.490
Yes!
-Let's go, baby!

00:35.491 --> 00:38.490
The all-powerful Express Pass.
-Whoo!

00:38.491 --> 00:40.760
<i>Meanwhile, Sheri fell apart.</i>

00:40.761 --> 00:42.610
I'm so sorry.

00:42.611 --> 00:43.890
It's not your fault or our fault.

00:43.891 --> 00:46.210
<i>But she and Cole got
some welcome news.</i>

00:46.211 --> 00:47.610
You're still racing,

00:47.611 --> 00:50.530
and you're about to start
the next leg right now.

00:50.531 --> 00:52.010
I would hug you, but I'm dirty.

00:52.011 --> 00:54.690
You're going to have to race
really hard to stay in this race.

00:54.691 --> 00:55.851
Here we go!

00:57.891 --> 00:59.890
(GIGGLES)

00:59.891 --> 01:02.290
Because we didn't get eliminated,
we can make...

01:02.291 --> 01:03.890
We'll be, will be making
lots of friends.

01:03.891 --> 01:06.210
If we had gotten eliminated
because of that, it'd be like,

01:06.211 --> 01:08.880
"Oh, Mom, no problem, no big deal.
It's... Whatever."

01:08.881 --> 01:10.450
Yeah, I will never live this down.

01:10.451 --> 01:12.290
But as soon as it's like,
"You're still in the race,"

01:12.291 --> 01:14.050
it's like,
"Aw, Mom, are you kidding me?!"

01:14.051 --> 01:16.811
Hopefully we can catch up
on this next leg.

01:18.171 --> 01:21.530
We're all catching this train
out of here to Georgia,

01:21.531 --> 01:24.650
so it's going to be another leg
where everyone's fresh,

01:24.651 --> 01:27.770
everyone's starting brand-new,
and all these teams are dangerous.

01:27.771 --> 01:29.810
Finishing in first,
we got the Express Pass

01:29.811 --> 01:31.610
which is going to be crucial,
I think.

01:31.611 --> 01:34.970
Hello. We're going to Tbilisi.
Two tickets.

01:34.971 --> 01:37.050
<i>Teams will now catch a train</i>

01:37.051 --> 01:41.250
heading north over Armenia's border
into Georgia,

01:41.251 --> 01:44.050
and, yes, they will be on
a midnight train to Georgia.

01:44.051 --> 01:48.090
<i>They'll find their next clue
in Georgia's capital, Tbilisi,</i>

01:48.091 --> 01:50.490
<i>at the statue of St George,</i>

01:50.491 --> 01:52.290
<i>a patron saint who is so revered</i>

01:52.291 --> 01:53.690
<i>they named the country after him.</i>

01:53.691 --> 01:55.250
Not sure what to expect.

01:55.251 --> 01:56.890
We're getting on a train,
it's dark out.

01:56.891 --> 02:00.370
It's kind of like
Platform 9 3/4 out of Harry Potter.

02:00.371 --> 02:02.610
Oh, my gosh. We have little beds.

02:02.611 --> 02:03.650
We have a place to sleep.

02:03.651 --> 02:05.650
Oh, man. Watch this.
I'm already asleep.

02:05.651 --> 02:07.330
I bet you are. Oh, my gosh.

02:07.331 --> 02:10.650
This is our place
for the next 10 hours.

02:10.651 --> 02:15.050
Oh, I'm sorry, babe,
my feet are going to stink... bad.

02:15.051 --> 02:17.610
I feel like I'm in a coffin.
(LAUGHS)

02:17.611 --> 02:19.810
Do we have showers?
'Cause we have towels.

02:19.811 --> 02:22.090
BLAIR: Especially with
the long train rides and stuff,

02:22.091 --> 02:23.330
there's lots of time where

02:23.331 --> 02:25.530
you just get to chat
and get to know each other.

02:25.531 --> 02:26.970
BRODIE: Blair's a super cute girl.

02:26.971 --> 02:29.690
We have talked about seeing
each other outside the race,

02:29.691 --> 02:32.090
so there is a little bit
of a connection there, I think.

02:32.091 --> 02:33.330
Oh, really?
-Yeah.

02:33.331 --> 02:35.890
Brodie and I have both decided that
there might be something there,

02:35.891 --> 02:37.930
and we're definitely going to see

02:37.931 --> 02:40.280
what's a possibility
when we get home.

02:40.281 --> 02:43.450
We are headed to Georgia!

02:43.451 --> 02:45.411
Georgia!

03:41.406 --> 03:43.085
Come on, Brodie.
-Matt, go, go, go, go.

03:43.086 --> 03:44.725
Taxi.
-Taxi!

03:44.726 --> 03:46.125
Freedom Square.

03:46.126 --> 03:48.085
Can you drive fast?

03:48.086 --> 03:50.405
Freedom Square?

03:50.406 --> 03:51.406
No, no...

03:51.407 --> 03:52.445
Good morning, Georgia.

03:52.446 --> 03:55.165
Hopefully going to head to
the front of the pack.

03:55.166 --> 03:57.765
KOREY: We've had some highs,
and now we've had some lows.

03:57.766 --> 03:59.205
I think we prefer the highs,

03:59.206 --> 04:00.925
so we're really going
to try our best

04:00.926 --> 04:02.925
to get back to
the front of the pack.

04:02.926 --> 04:05.205
Right now,
we are headed to Freedom Square.

04:05.206 --> 04:07.965
We're going to search for
the slayer of dragons,

04:07.966 --> 04:10.685
patron saint of Georgia,
to get our next clue.

04:10.686 --> 04:12.165
(COUGHS)

04:12.166 --> 04:13.925
(SPLUTTERS)

04:13.926 --> 04:19.644
Got a little bit of a... pulmonary
obstructive disease going on here.

04:19.646 --> 04:22.565
<i>Muy rapido.</i>
-Oh, that's Spanish, baby.

04:22.566 --> 04:24.965
We're going to Freedom Square.

04:24.966 --> 04:27.725
Oh, there, there it is.
-Yeah, right in front of us.

04:27.726 --> 04:30.565
Can we go to that statue?
-That statue?

04:30.566 --> 04:32.685
Let's get out of here
before the teams see us.

04:32.686 --> 04:33.725
Let's go, let's go.

04:33.726 --> 04:36.005
Oh, there's the Clue Box.

04:36.006 --> 04:39.285
"Make your way to
the Narikala Fortress,

04:39.286 --> 04:40.725
"ride the gondola down to the river,

04:40.726 --> 04:43.685
"make your way to Jvari Monastery
and search for the next clue."

04:43.686 --> 04:44.725
There it is. I see it.

04:44.726 --> 04:45.885
Ready, ready.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.195
Oh, there it is.
I see the Clue Box.

04:48.196 --> 04:49.365
Other side.

04:49.366 --> 04:50.925
"Make your way to
the Narikala Fortress,

04:50.926 --> 04:53.085
"ride the gondola down." OK.

04:53.086 --> 04:54.086
People always say,

04:54.087 --> 04:55.965
"Who wears the pants
in the relationship?"

04:55.966 --> 04:57.925
We like to say that
we both have a leg in

04:57.926 --> 05:00.165
and we tend to run opposite ways.

05:00.166 --> 05:03.485
But I think we know
how we work well together

05:03.486 --> 05:05.325
and that's been
playing to our advantage.

05:05.326 --> 05:09.045
"Make your way to Narikala Fortress
and search for your next clue."

05:09.046 --> 05:10.366
Alright.

05:11.926 --> 05:14.845
Oh, wow, this is so cool.
-Wow. This is actually unbelievable.

05:14.846 --> 05:18.485
It's a fortress/church.

05:18.486 --> 05:20.045
It's one of the oldest in the world.

05:20.046 --> 05:22.405
We're going up a big hill right now.
-Yeah!

05:22.406 --> 05:24.605
Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God. Are we going to make it?

05:24.606 --> 05:26.606
Dude, there's the gondolas.

05:29.886 --> 05:32.405
Up there. Up there.

05:32.406 --> 05:34.285
I do not like steep hills. Oh...

05:34.286 --> 05:37.245
If teams have to run up this,
we'll make up time on them.

05:37.246 --> 05:39.565
If somebody got dropped off
at the bottom of that hill.

05:39.566 --> 05:41.166
Great, great, great.
-Yes, great, great.

05:42.846 --> 05:45.285
Let's get on that gondola.

05:45.286 --> 05:46.405
We're the second ones is here.

05:46.406 --> 05:47.445
They're just getting on.

05:47.446 --> 05:50.685
Ty and Korey got here.
-It's alright.

05:50.686 --> 05:52.285
Number two ain't bad.

05:52.286 --> 05:54.485
He doesn't understand.
He took us the neighbourhood.

05:54.486 --> 05:56.885
Ask him,
"Is that not Narikala, up there?"

05:56.886 --> 05:58.606
Up there is Narikala?

06:00.126 --> 06:02.645
Just get out, get out.
-Alright.

06:02.646 --> 06:03.685
Do you see stairs?

06:03.686 --> 06:05.365
I don't know what to do.
He doesn't understand.

06:05.366 --> 06:07.685
Like, it's not even close.
-OK. Come on.

06:07.686 --> 06:10.125
There's steps right there.

06:10.126 --> 06:12.245
It says, "Narikala Fortress."

06:12.246 --> 06:13.965
We could be in front right now.

06:13.966 --> 06:15.525
We could be.

06:15.526 --> 06:17.325
We have hope that maybe some more

06:17.326 --> 06:19.605
drivers are having a difficult time.

06:19.606 --> 06:20.886
(CAR GEARS CRUNCH)
Oh!

06:27.326 --> 06:28.726
We have to walk
the rest of the way?

06:30.006 --> 06:31.805
I don't speak that.

06:31.806 --> 06:34.365
OK, Blair, it's going to be a walk.
Let's take our time.

06:34.366 --> 06:35.806
OK.

06:37.686 --> 06:39.045
This is so pretty.

06:39.046 --> 06:41.085
So much cool new architecture
that they're putting in

06:41.086 --> 06:42.605
to mix with the old stuff.

06:42.606 --> 06:44.885
At least we're seeing people -
that's the important thing, right?

06:44.886 --> 06:47.645
Yeah, we're not last.
-No, we're not last.

06:47.646 --> 06:49.605
Go, go.

06:49.606 --> 06:51.605
Let's start looking
where taxis are right there.

06:51.606 --> 06:54.045
"Ride down to the river and then
make your way to Jvari Monastery."

06:54.046 --> 06:56.005
So, Ty, it might not even be
on foot.

06:56.006 --> 06:58.045
How far? How many minutes?

06:58.046 --> 07:00.045
Minutes?

07:00.046 --> 07:01.525
30 minutes?
-30 minutes?

07:01.526 --> 07:03.926
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.
-Stop, stop...

07:05.246 --> 07:06.485
Thank you, thank you.

07:06.486 --> 07:07.885
Tyler and Korey are going.

07:07.886 --> 07:10.165
Thank you so much.

07:10.166 --> 07:12.485
Jvari?
-Yes, yes.

07:12.486 --> 07:14.645
That's where you're going? OK.
-Alright, let's go.

07:14.646 --> 07:16.885
(PANTS) Wow. Hell of a hike.

07:16.886 --> 07:20.645
Alright, they're up. Right up here.
-We did it.

07:20.646 --> 07:22.286
Wasn't the easy route.

07:23.766 --> 07:27.285
It looks like we're still headed
in the right direction.

07:27.286 --> 07:28.485
Taxi!
-Taxi!

07:28.486 --> 07:30.645
Taxi! Taxi!
-Taxi!

07:30.646 --> 07:33.605
So, we're making our way
to Jvari Monastery.

07:33.606 --> 07:35.006
Searching for our next clue.

07:36.526 --> 07:38.605
We got out of the city,

07:38.606 --> 07:41.445
and it looks like we are going
to the top of a mountain

07:41.446 --> 07:42.805
for the monastery.

07:42.806 --> 07:44.086
Oh, there's a Clue Box.

07:46.206 --> 07:48.005
Good job. Detour.

07:48.006 --> 07:50.365
Tyler and Korey will be
the first team

07:50.366 --> 07:53.805
who can choose whether they want to
learn about Georgian winemaking

07:53.806 --> 07:56.525
or this country's favourite candy.

07:56.526 --> 08:00.965
<i>It's believed that Georgia is
the birthplace of winemaking.</i>

08:00.966 --> 08:04.605
<i>Some winemakers here use
an ancient method of fermentation</i>

08:04.606 --> 08:07.685
<i>that dates back 8,000 years.</i>

08:07.686 --> 08:09.685
<i>After producing a batch of wine,</i>

08:09.686 --> 08:12.365
<i>these enormous clay pots
have to be cleaned -</i>

08:12.366 --> 08:15.965
<i>a job the teams will have to do
for their next clue.</i>

08:15.966 --> 08:20.005
There is no treat in Georgian
more popular than churchkhela,

08:20.006 --> 08:23.965
a long string of nuts <i>dipped in
a mixture of wine, flour and sugar.</i>

08:23.966 --> 08:27.965
<i>Following a recipe,
teams must make five churchkhelas</i>

08:27.966 --> 08:30.445
<i>and hang them out to dry
for their next clue.</i>

08:30.446 --> 08:31.446
We're going to do candy,

08:31.447 --> 08:33.245
we're going to do candy.
-We're going to do candy.

08:33.246 --> 08:36.405
Rev it. Right here, right here.
-Oh, Ty and Korey beat us.

08:36.405 --> 08:37.914
Oh, my God, we beat the boys.

08:37.916 --> 08:39.284
We're doing 'String'.

08:39.285 --> 08:41.125
Going to make some candy!

08:41.126 --> 08:45.155
There's only four stations,
so a team could show up

08:45.156 --> 08:49.486
and there not be a station for them,
and that could be crucial.

08:51.566 --> 08:53.205
Candy. Yeah.
-Candy?

08:53.206 --> 08:55.205
Let's do the candy. Let's go.
-OK. We're going to do the candy.

08:55.206 --> 08:56.325
Let's clean.
-OK.

08:56.326 --> 08:57.685
Let's clean.

08:57.686 --> 08:59.445
We'll do 'String'.

08:59.446 --> 09:01.155
I want to do 'String'.
-Alright. Let's do 'String'.

09:01.156 --> 09:02.525
OK. We're doing 'String'.

09:02.526 --> 09:04.036
Do we get to eat the candy?

09:07.326 --> 09:08.565
Down that way?

09:08.566 --> 09:10.485
Alright, let's go.

09:10.486 --> 09:12.405
Let's make some candy!

09:12.406 --> 09:13.915
Let's gets in and out of here.

09:13.916 --> 09:15.125
Hello.
-Hello.

09:15.126 --> 09:16.915
Alright,
let's see what we're doing here.

09:16.916 --> 09:18.765
We want to watch
how we thread the needle.

09:18.766 --> 09:20.035
Fold it in half.

09:20.036 --> 09:22.206
And then tie a little knot
in the end, Ty.

09:24.846 --> 09:26.445
Stick it through.

09:26.446 --> 09:28.326
All the way through.
Oh, that's it.

09:29.886 --> 09:32.365
How many? How many?

09:32.366 --> 09:33.765
'Oci'. What is that?

09:33.766 --> 09:34.845
You know, the language here,

09:34.846 --> 09:36.965
we're not, we're not really good
with the language,

09:36.966 --> 09:39.005
so there was
a bit of a language barrier.

09:39.006 --> 09:41.325
I'm just afraid of stabbing myself.

09:41.326 --> 09:42.405
Ty, you can do it.

09:42.406 --> 09:44.765
I'm aware I can do it.

09:44.766 --> 09:45.915
Let the record state

09:45.916 --> 09:48.965
this is the first time that Ashley
has ever passed up wine...

09:48.966 --> 09:50.405
..ever.
(GIGGLES)

09:50.406 --> 09:52.915
"There are four candy-making
stations available -

09:52.916 --> 09:54.325
"first come, first serve."

09:54.326 --> 09:56.285
We got a taxi
that knows where it is,

09:56.286 --> 09:57.485
so we're doing good.

09:57.486 --> 10:00.685
And if a station isn't available,
we spend that time...

10:00.686 --> 10:02.325
Learning.
-Yes... learning.

10:02.326 --> 10:03.685
I'm good at cleaning.

10:03.686 --> 10:05.485
Please, please let this
be mom skills.

10:05.486 --> 10:07.005
She's good at cleaning!

10:07.006 --> 10:10.035
I'm never good with
cleaning my room,

10:10.036 --> 10:13.006
but cleaning giant wineglasses?

10:14.286 --> 10:15.366
We'll see.

10:16.886 --> 10:18.285
It's so hard.

10:18.286 --> 10:19.915
Ty, oh, my God,
I can't pull it through.

10:19.916 --> 10:22.325
Putting the needle
through the hazelnut,

10:22.326 --> 10:23.915
that was almost impossible.

10:23.916 --> 10:28.365
You had to do that
20 times per string, five strings.

10:28.366 --> 10:30.005
Oh, my God.

10:30.006 --> 10:31.725
Oh, there was one stab.

10:31.726 --> 10:33.005
Stabbed myself once.

10:33.006 --> 10:35.085
How do you guys do this?

10:35.086 --> 10:36.605
Ow.
-Please be careful.

10:36.606 --> 10:39.726
Oh! (GROANS)

10:41.606 --> 10:43.325
Argh!
-Oh, my God.

10:43.326 --> 10:44.685
Brodie!
-What is wrong with you?

10:44.686 --> 10:47.565
Sorry.
-You're driving me nuts.

10:47.566 --> 10:50.366
Driving me hazelnuts!
-Driving me nuts!

10:51.366 --> 10:53.566
What's the best way
of doing this part?

10:55.126 --> 10:56.126
'Neegler gar'?

10:56.127 --> 10:57.725
That's what I need to do,
'neegler gar' it?

10:57.726 --> 10:59.086
'Neegler gar' it.

11:00.286 --> 11:01.845
'Neegler gar' it!

11:01.846 --> 11:03.206
My gosh!

11:04.846 --> 11:07.965
The trick is to not scream
while you're doing it.

11:07.966 --> 11:09.565
Argh!
-Ow!

11:09.566 --> 11:11.925
Babe, you with me?

11:11.926 --> 11:14.245
Come on, Rachie.

11:14.246 --> 11:16.205
OK, where we looking for now? 15?
-We're...

11:16.206 --> 11:18.285
Maybe through this door up here?

11:18.286 --> 11:20.285
Babe, we are so close
to everybody right now.

11:20.286 --> 11:22.085
Hello!
-Hi.

11:22.086 --> 11:24.485
Welcome to Bloody Fingers 101.

11:24.486 --> 11:26.725
OK. Great.
-Awesome.

11:26.726 --> 11:28.805
So we're the fourth one.
Oh, thank God.

11:28.806 --> 11:31.006
What does it say?
-Just says 15.

11:32.246 --> 11:34.045
There's four, there's four here.

11:34.046 --> 11:35.725
There's four here.

11:35.726 --> 11:37.765
We're so close, Daddy.

11:37.766 --> 11:39.085
Oh, my gosh!

11:39.086 --> 11:41.125
Everyone's here.

11:41.126 --> 11:42.485
All the stations are full,

11:42.486 --> 11:44.365
so the people that are here
are here,

11:44.366 --> 11:45.605
unless they decide that

11:45.606 --> 11:47.965
they can't stab themselves
in the fingers any longer

11:47.966 --> 11:48.966
and they switch.

11:48.967 --> 11:51.245
Yeah, we're switching.
-Let's go.

11:51.246 --> 11:52.925
Let's go back to our taxi.

11:52.926 --> 11:54.605
OK. We need the winery.

11:54.606 --> 11:57.005
We are screwed.

11:57.006 --> 11:59.406
Major big-time --screwed.

12:02.267 --> 12:03.307
Do you know where this is?

12:05.718 --> 12:07.957
It's not here?
(GROANS)

12:07.958 --> 12:10.517
We just have to find somebody
that knows where it is.

12:10.518 --> 12:12.157
Get to the taxi, baby.

12:12.158 --> 12:13.597
The dancers just ran that way.

12:13.598 --> 12:14.837
Oh, did they go back?

12:14.838 --> 12:16.877
Yeah. So we would be next here.

12:16.878 --> 12:19.677
Let's take this spot.
-OK. We're going to stay here.

12:19.678 --> 12:21.277
You guys are staying?

12:21.278 --> 12:22.957
We're staying because
the dancers left.

12:22.958 --> 12:23.997
Take our chances.

12:23.998 --> 12:26.157
We might have made a bad choice
switching.

12:26.158 --> 12:27.957
We just don't know.

12:27.958 --> 12:29.438
You just don't know what to do.

12:31.278 --> 12:33.037
Oh, is that it?

12:33.038 --> 12:34.557
Yes.

12:34.558 --> 12:37.277
OK. Let's go.

12:37.278 --> 12:39.917
OK.
-Iago? OK.

12:39.918 --> 12:42.837
OK, we need cleaning clothes.
Cole, cleaning clothes.

12:42.838 --> 12:44.997
Alright, let's get these things on

12:44.998 --> 12:47.557
and clean this thing!
-OK.

12:47.558 --> 12:50.477
Oh, so this is going to be fun.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.517
Alright, here I go, Mama.
-OK.

12:52.518 --> 12:54.758
Going down to the trough. Bye.

12:56.718 --> 12:57.837
Is it gross?

12:57.838 --> 12:59.437
There's a lot more than I thought.

12:59.438 --> 13:01.757
I'm taking this out, OK?

13:01.758 --> 13:05.197
Cole, at any point you want to
switch, you let me know, OK, baby?

13:05.198 --> 13:06.917
OK. Is this stuff edible?

13:06.918 --> 13:08.718
Good job, good job.

13:12.318 --> 13:14.157
Pretty terrifying.
-OK.

13:14.158 --> 13:18.357
And also,
this giant barrel is so cold.

13:18.358 --> 13:19.477
Is it cold in there, baby?

13:19.478 --> 13:21.917
Cole here, here. Gloves.

13:21.918 --> 13:24.637
Oh! We had...?

13:24.638 --> 13:27.237
Why are you wearing the gloves?
-I was protecting my hands.

13:27.238 --> 13:29.238
Oh, my God.
(LAUGHS)

13:31.598 --> 13:33.437
How many of these do we have
to make, Rach?

13:33.438 --> 13:35.117
We need five good strings.

13:35.118 --> 13:38.037
We've got to hanging -
we're working on three and four.

13:38.038 --> 13:39.477
God, my fingers hurt.

13:39.478 --> 13:41.757
Babe, don't poke yourself.
It hurts really bad.

13:41.758 --> 13:43.157
Ow!
-Dude!

13:43.158 --> 13:44.477
Dude, I stabbed myself,

13:44.478 --> 13:46.877
and so every nut has
a little piece of my blood.

13:46.878 --> 13:49.237
So, right now I'm trying to string
20 hazelnuts.

13:49.238 --> 13:52.637
Yesterday I was baking bread -
today I'm making candy.

13:52.638 --> 13:55.357
I'll have a full meal by the time
I'm done with The Amazing Race.

13:55.358 --> 13:57.437
Babe, are you having better luck
at this than I am?

13:57.438 --> 13:59.397
Getting the hazelnuts done?
-Yes, yes, babe.

13:59.398 --> 14:01.438
Can you just make the syrup?

14:02.558 --> 14:05.357
So, I'm
starting my... syrup, I guess?

14:05.358 --> 14:06.677
What is it, Korey?

14:06.678 --> 14:09.597
It's a glaze, a hazelnut glaze.

14:09.598 --> 14:12.317
We got a little bit of time
until we can dip our nuts.

14:12.318 --> 14:15.357
Alright, Tyler,
let's... just be easy here.

14:15.358 --> 14:18.117
We've been waiting to dip our nuts
for seven legs.

14:18.118 --> 14:20.877
Brodie, so, it gets thick,
it gets thick.

14:20.878 --> 14:23.157
Oh, baby! Kurt, I'm feeling it!

14:23.158 --> 14:26.157
Oh! And I just poked myself somehow!

14:26.158 --> 14:28.397
OK. One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

14:28.398 --> 14:30.037
..eight, 10, 12, 14...

14:30.038 --> 14:31.197
..15, 16, 17...

14:31.198 --> 14:34.117
..18 19, 20. Ty, yes.

14:34.118 --> 14:37.517
We've got our fifth string of nuts.

14:37.518 --> 14:39.477
Oh, yeah!

14:39.478 --> 14:41.517
Oh, wait. Go around the edge.

14:41.518 --> 14:43.997
There must be a trick
with the way you pull it out.

14:43.998 --> 14:46.157
OK. Now pull it straight up.

14:46.158 --> 14:47.357
Good?
Good?

14:47.358 --> 14:50.157
And that's it? We just dip it once?
-Yeah.

14:50.158 --> 14:52.517
It's like a candle? You keep going?
-No.

14:52.518 --> 14:54.037
Give me a little more
on the bottom of that one.

14:54.038 --> 14:55.877
Korey, this back side
isn't covered very...

14:55.878 --> 14:57.718
Just get a little more,
a little more, be safe.

14:59.278 --> 15:01.597
It's hard to not be able to ask
this man.

15:01.598 --> 15:04.117
Does he know for sure
where we are going?

15:04.118 --> 15:06.077
We're just driving out

15:06.078 --> 15:08.277
into nothing for 10 solid minutes

15:08.278 --> 15:10.158
watching the whole race
kind of pass us by.

15:11.358 --> 15:13.157
Sir, Chardakhi village, do you know?

15:13.158 --> 15:16.317
How far, how far? How long?

15:16.318 --> 15:18.238
10 minutes still?

15:19.838 --> 15:22.477
OK, hurry. Fast.

15:22.478 --> 15:24.557
This was suicide.

15:24.558 --> 15:26.397
Honestly,
if I knew it was 20 minutes away,

15:26.398 --> 15:28.238
I never would have left
that building.

15:30.718 --> 15:33.237
Does it look like you're making
any progress down there?

15:33.238 --> 15:34.957
Yes, I think I'm making progress.

15:34.958 --> 15:37.238
It's deep. I didn't realise
how deep this was.

15:39.238 --> 15:40.998
Good job, baby.

15:42.158 --> 15:43.758
Did everyone else choose candy?

15:45.078 --> 15:46.877
'Cause we're the first ones here.

15:46.878 --> 15:49.157
We're either killing it, or
I feel like everyone else did candy

15:49.158 --> 15:50.598
and they're already done with candy.

15:52.998 --> 15:55.037
Oh, I don't know, Kor.

15:55.038 --> 15:58.597
Hate standing around,
but we're learning something.

15:58.598 --> 16:00.157
There it is, there it is.

16:00.158 --> 16:02.078
Ma'am, ma'am, five.

16:04.558 --> 16:06.077
Good?

16:06.078 --> 16:07.677
Good?

16:07.678 --> 16:09.437
Two.

16:09.438 --> 16:10.558
So, this one's good?

16:11.958 --> 16:13.397
So redo it.

16:13.398 --> 16:14.637
No.

16:14.638 --> 16:16.037
I can tell what was wrong
with those.

16:16.038 --> 16:19.197
Those look completely terrible.
I would never sell those.

16:19.198 --> 16:20.757
Looks good. That looks good to me.

16:20.758 --> 16:23.637
We are making really good
progress at this point.

16:23.638 --> 16:24.998
Judge, judge.

16:28.118 --> 16:29.357
Which ones are good?

16:29.358 --> 16:32.237
One. This. One.
Oh, my God.

16:32.238 --> 16:33.878
What's wrong with this one?

16:36.238 --> 16:38.557
You're going to eat these
after we leave, I know you are.

16:38.558 --> 16:39.878
Ssh!

16:41.758 --> 16:44.237
Honestly, I don't know
what this guy is doing.

16:44.238 --> 16:46.237
I just want to scream...
I think we should tell him to go back.

16:46.238 --> 16:47.717
..so loud.

16:47.718 --> 16:50.757
Tell him to take us back
to this other candy thing.

16:50.758 --> 16:52.397
We just get back here.

16:52.398 --> 16:55.877
Just go. Back to the old...

16:55.878 --> 16:57.997
Back to... Go back, go back.

16:57.998 --> 16:59.197
No more.

16:59.198 --> 17:01.597
Take us back here.
-Just go back.

17:01.598 --> 17:03.277
Go back.

17:03.278 --> 17:05.637
What a disaster? What a nightmare.

17:07.637 --> 17:09.037
Oh, my God, these nuts.

17:09.038 --> 17:10.757
This is impossible.

17:10.758 --> 17:12.906
Let's watch.
Watch how they dip over here.

17:12.907 --> 17:14.837
(BOTH WHOOP)

17:14.838 --> 17:16.317
That's awesome.

17:16.318 --> 17:17.517
We're looking good.

17:17.518 --> 17:20.237
Oh, come here, black cat.

17:20.238 --> 17:21.718
Cat, bring us good luck.

17:24.558 --> 17:25.958
(BOTH WHOOP)

17:26.998 --> 17:28.037
Oh, they got it.

17:28.038 --> 17:29.517
Oh, my God, they crushed it.

17:29.518 --> 17:31.187
Thank you!

17:31.188 --> 17:33.237
It looks like Zach and
Rachel have jumped into the lead.

17:33.238 --> 17:34.277
OK, let's go.

17:34.278 --> 17:36.667
"Please make your way to
the Rustaveli National Theatre

17:36.668 --> 17:38.477
"and search for your next clue."

17:38.478 --> 17:39.908
Can we start here?

17:41.078 --> 17:42.597
Let's go back to our taxi.

17:42.598 --> 17:46.037
Good job, guys.
-It's good? Good, good?

17:46.038 --> 17:47.117
No, no, no.

17:47.118 --> 17:48.667
Yes, good. Oh-ho-ho!

17:48.668 --> 17:50.317
Babe.

17:50.318 --> 17:51.838
Are you kidding?!

17:52.958 --> 17:54.797
Looks like Burnie and Ashley
just got it.

17:54.798 --> 17:57.597
This hurts like a son of a bitch.

17:57.598 --> 17:58.997
We've got four more to do.

17:58.998 --> 18:00.187
I can't pull these...

18:00.188 --> 18:01.357
You want to switch?

18:01.358 --> 18:03.557
I can't pull these through anymore.

18:03.558 --> 18:04.637
KOREY: It just got to the point

18:04.638 --> 18:07.997
where I think both our thumbs
and fingers just hurt so much

18:07.998 --> 18:12.277
that we couldn't possibly put any
more of the hazelnuts on the string.

18:12.278 --> 18:15.037
Our needles were bent,
our fingers were numb

18:15.038 --> 18:17.187
'cause it was cold
and we were stabbing them.

18:17.188 --> 18:19.077
It felt like this was not
what we should be doing.

18:19.078 --> 18:20.427
I want to go clean the winery.

18:20.428 --> 18:22.117
Let's go.
Ty.

18:22.118 --> 18:23.637
Let's go, let's go.

18:23.638 --> 18:24.957
We're leaving.

18:24.958 --> 18:27.517
What?! Are you guys switching?

18:27.518 --> 18:28.957
Yeah.

18:28.958 --> 18:31.157
Our fingers are bleeding.

18:31.158 --> 18:33.397
OK, we've got a chance now, Blair.
-We've got a chance.

18:33.398 --> 18:35.357
Good luck, guys.
-Thank you.

18:35.358 --> 18:37.428
I don't know if that was
a smart decision.

18:38.233 --> 18:40.282
Alright, we're back.

18:40.499 --> 18:41.858
What's it called?
-Iago.

18:41.859 --> 18:43.448
Is there an address?
-No.

18:43.449 --> 18:45.658
Let's ask someone.
-The dancers are right there.

18:45.659 --> 18:47.978
Is Iago that way?
-Our taxi got lost.

18:47.979 --> 18:49.578
We haven't even found
a challenge yet.

18:49.579 --> 18:51.978
You have even found a challenge?
-That's so hard.

18:51.979 --> 18:53.739
Are you kidding me?

18:55.419 --> 18:57.778
Back to the winery!

18:58.946 --> 19:00.189
Go, go, go.

19:00.511 --> 19:03.200
Matt and Dana are following us.

19:03.201 --> 19:05.320
Their cab driver was having
some trouble.

19:05.321 --> 19:07.040
Go. Stay with that cab.

19:07.041 --> 19:10.480
OK, Cole, while I'm wiping it down,

19:10.481 --> 19:12.560
I want you to look in that barrel
over there

19:12.561 --> 19:13.680
and look at those barrels

19:13.681 --> 19:16.360
and see if there's water
in any of those barrels.

19:16.361 --> 19:18.200
These barrels?

19:18.201 --> 19:19.720
No.

19:19.721 --> 19:21.510
Are there, Cole?
-No.

19:21.511 --> 19:23.480
I don't think there's any water.

19:23.481 --> 19:25.640
Once you're done with that,
it should be good.

19:25.641 --> 19:26.880
Do you have any kids?

19:26.881 --> 19:30.440
Have you ever, like,
locked them in here for punishment?

19:30.441 --> 19:31.840
Have him check it.

19:31.841 --> 19:33.511
I'm thinking it's looking
really good.

19:37.511 --> 19:39.320
So it needs more?
-A little bit more.

19:39.321 --> 19:40.800
I'm looking for water.

19:40.801 --> 19:42.800
There's got to be water.
Look for a hose.

19:42.801 --> 19:45.680
Oh, right here, right...

19:45.681 --> 19:47.990
Right on the truck!
-Oh, my gosh, Cole!

19:47.991 --> 19:50.360
It's right there, I'm sorry.
-That's OK, Cole.

19:50.361 --> 19:52.641
This could make it
so much easier for me.

19:53.881 --> 19:55.510
This is it. This is it, good.

19:55.511 --> 19:57.560
There it is. Right there.

19:57.561 --> 20:00.040
OK, Rach. Come on, baby.

20:00.041 --> 20:03.080
This is Georgia's national theatre,
Rustaveli.

20:03.081 --> 20:07.240
Built in 1879, it's where teams will
perform their Roadblock.

20:07.241 --> 20:08.990
"Who's light on their feet?"
-You are. Let's win a leg.

20:08.991 --> 20:10.961
Light. It's going to be ballet.

20:11.236 --> 20:14.435
<i>Teams are bound to be mesmerised
by the remarkable skill</i>

20:15.233 --> 20:18.873
<i>and athletic ability of this
country's premier ballet troupe.</i>

20:21.953 --> 20:25.592
Who use their extraordinary strength
and elegant movement

20:25.593 --> 20:28.112
to create this dazzling routine.

20:28.113 --> 20:30.312
Once they've mastered
the manoeuvres,

20:30.313 --> 20:33.032
the choreographer will give them
their next clue.

20:33.033 --> 20:34.902
You can do it.
-Are you kidding me?

20:34.903 --> 20:36.632
You dance. You dance.

20:36.633 --> 20:38.832
I had done a little dance as a kid,
like tap dance.

20:38.833 --> 20:40.592
You teach me, teach me.

20:40.593 --> 20:43.312
It's been many years
since I've tap danced

20:43.313 --> 20:45.632
and can remember moves with my body.

20:45.633 --> 20:47.792
Uh, this hat, it looks great.

20:47.793 --> 20:53.112
(TRADITIONAL GEORGIAN MUSIC PLAYS)

20:53.113 --> 20:54.393
I'm watching the dance.

20:55.269 --> 20:56.549
Wow.

20:58.309 --> 20:59.509
That's fast.

21:02.429 --> 21:03.989
Wow, this is really fast.

21:07.746 --> 21:10.906
ZACH: I took this was going to be
easy. Maybe a waltz or something.

21:12.106 --> 21:13.386
It was not that.

21:15.666 --> 21:18.345
There was a jump thing,
crossing your legs,

21:18.346 --> 21:20.986
swishy leg cross, bend down thing.

21:22.106 --> 21:23.586
It scared me.

21:29.626 --> 21:30.826
Oh, I'm nervous!

21:35.146 --> 21:36.256
Wow.

21:37.946 --> 21:40.466
That's fast. OK, let's learn.

21:42.536 --> 21:44.665
You've got it, Daddy.
Slow and steady.

21:44.666 --> 21:47.255
16, 17, 18, 19.
One more and this string's finished.

21:47.256 --> 21:52.585
I'm just Betty Crocker-ing over here
while my daddy does the grunt work.

21:52.586 --> 21:55.065
Yeah, boom. Boom, boom.

21:55.066 --> 21:56.506
They don't get better than that.

21:58.386 --> 22:00.385
Good? OK, let's go.

22:00.386 --> 22:01.625
Good job, guys.

22:01.626 --> 22:04.265
They're probably just now getting
to the other Detour,

22:04.266 --> 22:05.425
so just slow and steady.

22:05.426 --> 22:07.425
Bye, guys. Good job.

22:07.426 --> 22:08.505
Alright, good luck, guys.

22:08.506 --> 22:09.905
I'm nervous for Blair
and Scott, though.

22:09.906 --> 22:11.865
We're hoping that Blair and Scott

22:11.866 --> 22:14.705
stay in front of a least one team
today and survive the leg.

22:14.706 --> 22:17.626
We definitely have a chance.

22:18.946 --> 22:21.145
Where do we go.
-Ready, guys?

22:21.146 --> 22:22.265
Yeah, let's go.

22:22.266 --> 22:26.145
For all we know, Sheri and Cole
could be here, they could be lost.

22:26.146 --> 22:28.665
Mom, two of the other teams
just got here.

22:28.666 --> 22:30.385
We thought we were last.

22:30.386 --> 22:32.025
It's OK. Stay calm.

22:32.026 --> 22:33.425
We thought we were last!

22:33.426 --> 22:35.625
We just got frustrated and left.

22:35.626 --> 22:37.825
There's still some teams over there
doing candy.

22:37.826 --> 22:39.545
We just all have to knock this out.

22:39.546 --> 22:42.146
I'll get down there and scoop
and you run and dump.

22:43.866 --> 22:45.185
It's good, it's good!

22:45.186 --> 22:46.745
Oh, thank you! Thank you.

22:46.746 --> 22:48.025
We'll see you at the Roadblock.

22:48.026 --> 22:49.745
Are you all good, Momma?
-Yeah.

22:49.746 --> 22:51.025
OK, we hunt down a taxi.

22:51.026 --> 22:53.985
Give me the tools.

22:53.986 --> 22:55.506
Come on, baby, we got this one.

22:56.546 --> 22:58.025
This is the
Rustaveli National Theatre?

22:58.026 --> 22:59.385
There, I see a marker.

22:59.386 --> 23:00.986
Here we go, right here.

23:06.933 --> 23:08.972
"Who's light on their feet?"
-I am.

23:08.973 --> 23:10.412
Ashley is our dancer.

23:10.413 --> 23:11.532
Lesson one.

23:11.533 --> 23:12.972
Right...
-Right.

23:12.973 --> 23:14.413
..left.
-Left.

23:19.573 --> 23:21.692
ASHLEY: I took a little
bit of dancing in high school,

23:21.693 --> 23:23.012
but nothing to really prepare me

23:23.013 --> 23:25.093
for being part
of the Georgian ballet.

23:28.375 --> 23:29.534
ZACH: It was hard.

23:29.535 --> 23:30.614
Faster?

23:30.615 --> 23:33.654
You would learn the steps
and then he'd add hand motions.

23:33.655 --> 23:36.255
So there were a lot of little
details that were adding up.

23:40.095 --> 23:42.095
Oh, this is exciting!

23:43.975 --> 23:45.454
One, two...

23:45.455 --> 23:47.054
No, left.

23:47.055 --> 23:49.814
(LAUGHS) What are we doing!

23:49.815 --> 23:51.974
Do your boots fit?

23:51.975 --> 23:54.214
I feel like I'm working these boots.

23:54.215 --> 23:55.814
(LAUGHS)

23:55.815 --> 23:58.454
This is better than the candy.

23:58.455 --> 23:59.614
This is way better.

23:59.615 --> 24:01.534
Fill it up as much as you can, baby.

24:01.535 --> 24:03.414
Man, this really sucks
but you know what,

24:03.415 --> 24:07.734
if it means we get to stay
in the race, I'll do this all day.

24:07.735 --> 24:10.214
Beautiful, beautiful?
-Yeah, yeah?

24:10.215 --> 24:12.214
Oh, last one.

24:12.215 --> 24:13.615
Check.

24:15.135 --> 24:16.854
Maybe that one.

24:16.855 --> 24:18.814
Yeah? Oh!

24:18.815 --> 24:21.054
Daddy, it good job. Good job.

24:21.055 --> 24:24.374
Come on, baby, we got this one.
-I'm really getting close, babe.

24:24.375 --> 24:27.014
Who do we get to check it?
I'm really close.

24:27.015 --> 24:29.214
Ty, water.

24:29.215 --> 24:31.094
Water, coming.

24:31.095 --> 24:33.054
Ty.
-I'm coming.

24:33.055 --> 24:34.694
I'm going as fast as I can.
-Give me the brush.

24:34.695 --> 24:36.934
Alright, it's looking pretty good.

24:36.935 --> 24:39.255
Ty. Ty!
-Coming.

24:40.255 --> 24:41.294
Come on.

24:41.295 --> 24:43.374
Check, check, check.

24:43.375 --> 24:44.935
They're getting a check.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.454
It's good.
-Thank you so much.

24:50.455 --> 24:52.374
Thank you so much.
-Thank you, thank you.

24:52.375 --> 24:54.214
It's good, it's good.
Theirs is good.

24:54.215 --> 24:55.574
Oh, my God.

24:55.575 --> 24:57.415
Can we get a check or something?
-Can we check?

25:06.015 --> 25:07.054
Not good enough, Ty.

25:07.055 --> 25:09.534
Oh, yeah! That's that hustle.

25:09.535 --> 25:11.894
A clean brush and clean sponge.

25:11.895 --> 25:13.534
Clean brush and clean sponge!
-I'm coming!

25:13.535 --> 25:14.734
I'm going as fast as I can.

25:14.735 --> 25:17.614
Ty, I don't know how to get
this last bit of gunk.

25:17.615 --> 25:18.695
Oh, my God.

25:25.052 --> 25:26.891
Ty, we're getting close.

25:26.892 --> 25:28.011
Korey, you're doing so good.

25:28.012 --> 25:29.531
Can we check? Can we check?

25:29.532 --> 25:31.331
It looks so good, Korey.
-It look's so clean.

25:31.332 --> 25:32.411
Yeah.

25:32.412 --> 25:34.091
Yes.

25:34.092 --> 25:37.131
Clean?
-Thank you.

25:37.132 --> 25:38.452
We're dead last.

25:41.044 --> 25:42.723
Seven...

25:42.724 --> 25:44.603
Wait. Why am I on the wrong...?

25:44.604 --> 25:46.763
Seven, eight...

25:46.764 --> 25:48.243
You're sure about this?
-Yeah.

25:48.244 --> 25:49.363
I'll do it if you're sure about it.

25:49.364 --> 25:51.123
Kurt's going to do it.
-I'm going to do it.

25:51.124 --> 25:52.764
One...
-Yeah.

25:57.004 --> 25:58.443
If you've done some dance before,

25:58.444 --> 26:01.884
picking up the basics
of the choreography wasn't too bad.

26:03.364 --> 26:04.684
I think I've mostly got it.

26:08.924 --> 26:11.003
I've salsa danced
for the past 10-plus years,

26:11.004 --> 26:13.203
so I'm pretty good at picking up
choreography.

26:13.204 --> 26:15.683
So then I'll watch dance moves
on YouTube and copy them.

26:15.684 --> 26:17.523
Yeah, boy!

26:17.524 --> 26:19.364
I was able to pick it up
pretty quick.

26:24.044 --> 26:25.363
Oh!

26:25.364 --> 26:26.843
Yes, Kurt.
-Wow.

26:26.844 --> 26:28.644
Yeah! Let's go.

26:30.284 --> 26:32.364
So, I turn this way first
or this way first?

26:34.484 --> 26:38.243
One, two, three, four, five, six...

26:38.244 --> 26:40.523
Seven, eight...

26:40.524 --> 26:42.723
Yeah. I don't get the move, though.

26:42.724 --> 26:44.804
Let's do it, my man. Let's go.

26:48.204 --> 26:50.843
Six, seven, eight...

26:50.844 --> 26:52.723
Good? You think I'm ready?

26:52.724 --> 26:55.043
OK, alright.
I think I'm going to try it.

26:55.044 --> 26:57.243
OK, beginning.

26:57.244 --> 26:58.443
We've still got a shot
at first here.

26:58.444 --> 26:59.484
Still got a shot at first.

27:01.364 --> 27:04.043
I was excited, a little bit nervous

27:04.044 --> 27:05.484
because no-one had gone yet.

27:09.964 --> 27:12.243
So excited, in fact,
that I went a little bit early.

27:12.244 --> 27:14.003
I was supposed to wait a little bit.

27:14.004 --> 27:16.683
So wait until you guys are out?
-Yes. -OK, sorry.

27:16.684 --> 27:19.163
Wow! This is a tough dance.

27:19.164 --> 27:21.003
We're going to try.

27:21.004 --> 27:22.964
She's going again,
she's going again.

27:25.724 --> 27:27.244
Here she goes.

27:41.884 --> 27:43.403
I'm going to run out of breath
before she does.

27:43.404 --> 27:45.523
I'm going to lose it.
I'm going to absolutely lose it.

27:45.524 --> 27:47.644
Three, four, five...

27:54.364 --> 27:55.603
Good? Yes, yes!

27:55.604 --> 27:57.883
(CHEERS)
Ashley just nailed this.

27:57.884 --> 28:00.044
Good luck, guys. Good luck.

28:01.524 --> 28:02.803
Thank you so much.

28:02.804 --> 28:04.403
OK, let's read that.
I've got all your stuff.

28:04.404 --> 28:05.963
"Make your way to the next Pit Stop.

28:05.964 --> 28:07.724
"The Rike Park
next to Peace Bridge."

28:08.964 --> 28:11.563
This futuristic pedestrian bridge

28:11.564 --> 28:16.123
stretches nearly <i>500 feet
across the Mtkvari River.</i>

28:16.124 --> 28:18.563
<i>Located in the heart of Tbilisi,</i>

28:18.564 --> 28:21.723
the Bridge of Peace is now the
Pit Stop for this leg of the race.

28:21.724 --> 28:25.523
<i>The last team to reach the mat
may be eliminated.</i>

28:25.524 --> 28:27.163
There you go, get a taxi.
-Get a taxi.

28:27.164 --> 28:29.003
Rike Park.

28:29.004 --> 28:31.123
I'm so grateful I didn't have to do
that Roadblock.

28:31.124 --> 28:32.363
Holy cow!

28:32.364 --> 28:34.843
Ho! We might be in last.

28:34.844 --> 28:36.723
We celebrate mediocrity

28:36.724 --> 28:40.523
because it turns out really well
for us in the end usually.

28:40.524 --> 28:42.244
We can't get gas.

28:44.324 --> 28:46.123
OK. Quickly, please. Quickly.

28:46.124 --> 28:47.923
Fast, fast, fast.

28:47.924 --> 28:49.524
Oh, my gosh.

28:51.404 --> 28:53.284
Oh, this is horrible.

28:54.884 --> 28:59.244
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight...

29:05.444 --> 29:07.403
No. Messed up bands.

29:17.684 --> 29:20.163
Slow and steady, baby!

29:20.164 --> 29:21.403
Oh!

29:21.404 --> 29:23.803
KURT: It was a lot more demanding
than you think

29:23.804 --> 29:26.363
because it's one of the fastest
dancing performances

29:26.364 --> 29:28.363
that I've seen on
The Amazing Race ever.

29:28.364 --> 29:30.403
"Who's light on their feet?" I am.
-Let's go.

29:30.404 --> 29:32.563
I almost cried because I was, like,

29:32.564 --> 29:35.323
so happy to see a dance challenge.

29:35.324 --> 29:38.524
Let's see if 16 years of dance
lessons paid off.

29:51.364 --> 29:52.643
Oh, I didn't get it!

29:52.644 --> 29:55.084
I didn't get it. My bad.
-Figure it out, Kurt!

29:56.324 --> 29:57.883
Where's Tyler and Korey?

29:57.884 --> 29:59.923
They're right behind us.

29:59.924 --> 30:02.644
Oh, good, a wig. Just what I wanted.

30:07.044 --> 30:08.443
DANA: Honestly, this is the longest

30:08.444 --> 30:11.123
I have gone in my whole life
without dancing.

30:11.124 --> 30:13.003
I started dancing at, like,
two or three

30:13.004 --> 30:15.523
and I've never gone a month
without dancing.

30:15.524 --> 30:18.123
KOREY: I did feel like
it was just going to be a task

30:18.124 --> 30:20.964
that I could get through quickly
and hopefully make up some time.

30:24.484 --> 30:26.404
You've got it, babe.
Go up there and learn it.

30:28.044 --> 30:30.163
Oh, no. That'll mess me up.

30:30.164 --> 30:31.284
Ya!

Five, six, seven, eight.

30:43.724 --> 30:45.164
Seven, eight. OK. Got it. Got it.

30:47.164 --> 30:48.923
Give me like 30 seconds.

30:48.924 --> 30:50.908
I'm out of breath. I'm tired.

30:55.645 --> 30:57.404
OK. We think this guy's taking
us to where we need to go.

30:57.405 --> 30:58.524
Oh, my gosh.
-If we get there first,

30:58.525 --> 30:59.604
we're in first.

30:59.605 --> 31:01.724
This is it here.
-This is it. OK. Great.

31:01.725 --> 31:03.844
This looks like a great place
for a Pit Stop to me.

31:03.845 --> 31:04.885
Thank you!
-Thank you.

31:05.885 --> 31:06.885
OK.

31:07.965 --> 31:10.284
We need to find Peace Bridge.
-Down the stairs.

31:10.285 --> 31:12.124
Maybe we should ask. Let's ask.

31:12.125 --> 31:14.044
We have a lead. Let's not blow it.

31:14.045 --> 31:15.565
Is this Rike Park?

31:20.525 --> 31:23.244
It's not here?
-Not here?

31:23.245 --> 31:25.364
We came to the wrong park.

31:27.285 --> 31:28.964
In Georgian, yes.
-Yes, please, please, please.

31:28.965 --> 31:31.364

-We're at the wrong park.

never performed them at the tempo.

in this confined space of the stage.

Oh, my God, Kor!

40:17.564 --> 40:19.563
Are we on the sidewalk?

40:19.564 --> 40:20.643
Oh, my God.

40:20.644 --> 40:23.243
I think we're driving
on the sidewalk.

40:23.244 --> 40:25.163
Are they stopping there?

40:25.164 --> 40:26.723
Yeah, they're getting out.
-Where is it?

40:26.724 --> 40:27.724
Right there.

40:28.924 --> 40:30.843
Run! Run!

40:30.844 --> 40:32.644
Oh, I see it!
-Is that Phil?

40:34.204 --> 40:35.804
Come on, Blair! Come on!
-I'm coming!

40:37.164 --> 40:38.164
Korey!

40:41.284 --> 40:42.284
Wow.

40:44.164 --> 40:45.993
(CRIES)

40:45.994 --> 40:47.764
They got it, Daddy.
Don't give up!

40:50.404 --> 40:51.953
Bring it in, guys. Bring it in.

40:51.954 --> 40:52.994
Good job.

40:56.084 --> 40:59.844
What a dramatic finish
to this leg of the race.

41:00.954 --> 41:04.603
Tyler and Korey,
by the skin of your teeth,

41:04.604 --> 41:06.764
you have made it through
this leg of the race.

41:07.924 --> 41:10.163
That was the hardest thing
I've ever done.

41:10.164 --> 41:12.043
And I didn't want to let Tyler down!

41:12.044 --> 41:14.523
(SOBS) You did so good!

41:14.524 --> 41:16.083
(CRIES)

41:16.084 --> 41:17.953
(LAUGHS) No more dancing for you.

41:17.954 --> 41:20.843
I think I finally did put
the Korey in choreography.

41:20.844 --> 41:23.243
I don't think you did. (LAUGHS)

41:23.244 --> 41:25.953
I mean, some day I'm going to play
that song and you're going to have,

41:25.954 --> 41:27.363
like, war flashbacks.

41:27.364 --> 41:29.723
Yeah, just glad to still be here.

41:29.724 --> 41:31.993
Scott and Blair,
I'm so sorry to tell you

41:31.994 --> 41:34.203
that you are the last team
to arrive.

41:34.204 --> 41:36.804
And unfortunately, you have been
eliminated from the race.

41:38.434 --> 41:40.123
I can't even put into words

41:40.124 --> 41:42.473
how lucky I am
to have a dad like this.

41:42.474 --> 41:44.883
My dad has always just been my hero

41:44.884 --> 41:49.083
and really is just the kindest,
most amazing man in the world

41:49.084 --> 41:51.563
and I'm so lucky
to have him as my dad.

41:51.564 --> 41:53.363
Did you learn some new things
about your daughter?

41:53.364 --> 41:54.403
I really did, yeah.

41:54.404 --> 41:55.763
She's incredible.

41:55.764 --> 41:56.883
She can do anything.

41:56.884 --> 41:59.683
Blair was more successful
in her life at the age of 15

41:59.684 --> 42:02.083
than I was at the age of 50.

42:02.084 --> 42:03.763
And...

42:03.764 --> 42:05.473
..what can I say?

42:05.474 --> 42:07.763
You've got to be proud
to have a daughter like that.

42:07.764 --> 42:08.924
I love you.
