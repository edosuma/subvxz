WEBVTT

00:06.166 --> 00:09.709
(Martha)
'It's really cold outside,
and then when you come
inside..'

00:09.792 --> 00:13.792
Whoo, it's really warm in
here,
so I'm a little frizzy.

00:13.875 --> 00:15.500
Okay, hold on.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.125
[chuckles]
I can't see.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.041
Okay.

00:21.542 --> 00:24.417
Um, I'm Martha.

00:26.208 --> 00:27.542
Should we cut?

00:27.625 --> 00:28.917
Should we start over?

00:29.000 --> 00:29.834
No?

00:29.917 --> 00:31.375
Go ahead.
Talk about
yourself.

00:31.458 --> 00:32.875
Oh, me.

00:34.291 --> 00:36.417
Uh, I'm 33.

00:36.500 --> 00:38.917
And I'd really like to leave
Philadelphia someday.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.458
Oh, and uh,
I'm a mortician's assistant.

00:44.542 --> 00:45.834
'Uh.'

00:45.917 --> 00:48.458
I am such
a sappy romantic.

00:49.542 --> 00:50.500
I'm not cool.

00:53.458 --> 00:55.959
But I believe in love.

00:56.041 --> 00:59.125
It changes your life
from black and white to
color.

00:59.208 --> 01:02.542
Like...you could be sitting
in the park one day

01:02.625 --> 01:05.375
just watching the leaves.

01:05.458 --> 01:08.125
You know,
maybe with your lunch..

01:08.208 --> 01:10.291
...and you can meet somebody.

01:10.375 --> 01:13.667
You know, maybe his dog
runs up to you or something

01:13.750 --> 01:16.166
and you lock eyes..

01:16.250 --> 01:18.959
...and your whole life
changes on the spot.

01:22.500 --> 01:25.667
You have to believe
that kind of thing is
possible

01:25.750 --> 01:27.250
or you'll go crazy.

01:28.917 --> 01:31.667
- Is that good?
- Uh-huh.

01:31.750 --> 01:34.875
So, uh, w-what
happens now?

01:34.959 --> 01:36.625
I-I've never
done this before.

01:36.709 --> 01:38.208
Men come in,
they watch your
tape.

01:38.291 --> 01:40.083
If they like it,
they make you a
tape.

01:40.166 --> 01:42.834
You watch it,
if you like it, you go
out.

01:42.917 --> 01:44.166
Great!

01:44.250 --> 01:46.500
Our service doesn't work
for everyone.

01:46.583 --> 01:48.458
'People can be
really superficial.'

01:48.542 --> 01:51.250
But it's inner beauty
that counts in the end.

02:43.917 --> 02:45.709
Sweet pad.

02:45.792 --> 02:47.875
Well, if you
like zebra print.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.709
(John)
'It belongs
to the IRS now.'

02:49.792 --> 02:51.417
Owner here, Ramon Delgado.

02:51.500 --> 02:54.750
Credit card fraud
finally caught up with him.

02:54.834 --> 02:56.083
Is that why he
offed himself?

02:56.166 --> 02:58.041
He didn't leave a note.

02:58.125 --> 03:00.417
(Scotty)
'Well, it wasn't for lack
of confidence.'

03:00.500 --> 03:02.583
Guy's got a little
crush on himself.

03:02.667 --> 03:04.417
So, why are we out
on a suicide?

03:04.500 --> 03:06.625
I didn't bring you
down here for him.

03:09.166 --> 03:12.667
You have to believe
that kind of thing is
possible

03:12.750 --> 03:14.709
or you'll go crazy.

03:14.792 --> 03:18.458
- What, she's a cold job?
- 1989. Martha Puck.

03:18.542 --> 03:20.542
.45 shot to the back.

03:20.625 --> 03:21.917
(Scotty)
'What's up with the tape?'

03:22.000 --> 03:24.083
Label says
it's from a dating service.

03:24.166 --> 03:26.083
And Delgado was watching it
when he shot himself?

03:26.166 --> 03:28.834
Neighbor heard the gunshot,
came up, found the tape
playing.

03:28.917 --> 03:32.458
So what's the connect
between Ramon and Martha Puck?

03:32.542 --> 03:34.125
(John)
'Million dollar question,
Scotty.'

03:34.208 --> 03:35.792
Mm, he a suspect
first time around?

03:35.875 --> 03:38.208
- Name never came up.
- Well, maybe he ripped her
off.

03:38.291 --> 03:39.667
I mean guy's a con artist.

03:39.750 --> 03:42.083
No, her face was the last
thing
he wants to see

03:42.166 --> 03:44.041
'before the lights go out?'

03:44.125 --> 03:46.458
Got to be more
than a con.

03:46.542 --> 03:48.041
Maybe it's a love thing.

03:52.542 --> 03:54.000
What?

03:54.083 --> 03:56.417
Well, putting a
connection
between these two?

03:58.166 --> 04:00.000
No wonder this
job went cold.

04:37.709 --> 04:39.375
Martha Puck,
33 years old.

04:39.458 --> 04:41.709
Body found by the
garbage
collector in the alley

04:41.792 --> 04:42.834
behind Delroy's Pizza.

04:42.917 --> 04:44.166
(Kat)
'No witnesses, no purse'

04:44.250 --> 04:45.959
and a lot of loose change
around the body

04:46.041 --> 04:47.333
so the theory was a mugging.

04:47.417 --> 04:48.834
No next of kin to follow up.

04:48.917 --> 04:52.041
Martha was an orphan,
so the case went cold fast.

04:52.125 --> 04:55.458
Roommate, Stephanie Levine,
said Martha hardly had
friends.

04:55.542 --> 04:57.041
'No enemies she
could think of.'

04:57.125 --> 04:59.667
Lifestyle wasn't risky.
No shady connections.

04:59.750 --> 05:03.041
Which doesn't explain
the connection to Ramon Delgado.

05:03.125 --> 05:04.542
'Cause he's shady for sure.

05:04.625 --> 05:07.750
IRS had him on tax evasion
and credit card fraud.

05:07.834 --> 05:09.208
Well, small-time stuff.

05:09.291 --> 05:10.458
Not the same as murder.

05:10.542 --> 05:13.667
Maybe he ripped Martha off,
back in the day?

05:13.750 --> 05:15.125
Yeah.

05:15.208 --> 05:17.542
(Kat)
'Or maybe he's got
some kind of fetish.'

05:21.000 --> 05:25.083
Well, she's a specific
kind of woman.

05:29.875 --> 05:32.709
So I got an apartment
last weekend.

05:32.792 --> 05:34.208
No kidding.

05:34.291 --> 05:36.208
Figured what the heck.

05:36.291 --> 05:37.959
You ain't gonna miss
motel life?

05:38.041 --> 05:39.250
There's only a
certain kind of
woman

05:39.333 --> 05:41.458
you can bring
back
to a motel room.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.417
You're looking to upgrade.

05:43.500 --> 05:44.542
Thing is..

05:45.542 --> 05:47.166
...I'm no good on my own.

05:48.041 --> 05:49.959
Yeah. I hear you.

05:54.709 --> 05:56.917
Stephanie Levine?

05:57.000 --> 05:59.208
Oh. I'm sorry,
we don't do tuxes.

05:59.291 --> 06:01.333
- Oh, neither do we.
- Philly Homicide.

06:01.417 --> 06:04.250
Here about your roommate
Martha Puck.

06:04.333 --> 06:06.250
Oh.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.917
Could you give me a minute?
Thank you.

06:10.709 --> 06:12.041
Martha?

06:12.125 --> 06:14.291
- What about her?
- Do you recognize this guy?

06:17.875 --> 06:19.834
Oh, hello, memory lane.

06:20.917 --> 06:22.500
'Yep, we both knew him.'

06:22.583 --> 06:25.083
Never met him,
but saw him on tape.

06:25.166 --> 06:27.000
Video dating tape?

06:27.083 --> 06:29.500
I made Martha sign up
for a dating service

06:29.583 --> 06:32.166
"Love Juncture,"
so she could meet a real man.

06:32.250 --> 06:34.291
"Real man." Meaning what?

06:34.375 --> 06:37.667
As in not in one
of her romance novels.

06:37.750 --> 06:39.875
She would read
those things all day.

06:39.959 --> 06:43.083
Well, how'd it work out for
Martha with the dating
service?

06:43.166 --> 06:45.083
Truthfully?

06:45.166 --> 06:47.333
Better for me than for her.

06:47.417 --> 06:50.583
[gasps]
No. It's too many!

06:50.667 --> 06:53.208
That's what you get
for being so hot, girl.

06:54.959 --> 06:56.917
Let me check your box, Miss..

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Puck.

06:58.083 --> 06:59.709
Martha.

06:59.792 --> 07:01.041
Is this for..

07:01.125 --> 07:02.500
Oh, wow, yeah.

07:02.583 --> 07:03.792
It's for you.

07:07.083 --> 07:09.583
"Ray-mon Del-gay-do."

07:20.458 --> 07:21.417
Hey.

07:21.500 --> 07:22.625
I'm Ramon.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.041
Ramon.

07:24.125 --> 07:25.542
(Ramon)
'Martha.'

07:26.917 --> 07:28.542
I really liked your tape.

07:28.625 --> 07:31.333
Uh, you don't know
how many tapes I've watched.

07:31.417 --> 07:35.625
It seems like every girl's
stuck-up or into herself.

07:36.625 --> 07:40.333
'So...baseball, uh..'

07:40.417 --> 07:44.792
...Italian food, ice
skating
on a lake, not a rink.

07:44.875 --> 07:46.709
Uh, dogs, cats

07:46.792 --> 07:49.625
'any kind of animal,
traveling places.'

07:50.417 --> 07:52.792
Uh, laughing.

07:52.875 --> 07:55.000
Yeah, that's me.

07:55.083 --> 07:57.458
Well, if that's not
corny as hell..

07:58.750 --> 08:00.417
Maybe you'd like to meet me
in person.

08:06.542 --> 08:08.709
[gasps]
He..

08:08.792 --> 08:10.542
[scoffs]
I..

08:10.625 --> 08:12.375
Did you see?

08:12.458 --> 08:14.041
I'm sorry, sweetie.

08:14.125 --> 08:15.250
That guy?

08:15.333 --> 08:17.208
- What?
- Uh.

08:17.291 --> 08:20.166
He didn't even
me

08:20.250 --> 08:23.083
Well, maybe he's looking
for someone more my type.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.542
was

08:29.625 --> 08:33.750
What are the chances of finding
my dream man on the first tape?

08:35.959 --> 08:38.542
You'll find
your Mr.
Right.

08:38.625 --> 08:40.583
And it'll be when
you least expect
it.

08:44.750 --> 08:47.291
I was trying to protect
Martha
from people like that.

08:47.375 --> 08:48.709
People like what?

08:48.792 --> 08:51.291
Users, scumbags,
arrogant
bastards.

08:51.375 --> 08:53.959
[scoffs]
You know how
you people can be.

08:56.041 --> 08:59.250
Uh, did she ever take
Ramon up on his offer?

08:59.333 --> 09:00.542
I never saw him again.

09:00.625 --> 09:01.625
Thanks for
your time.

09:01.709 --> 09:02.750
Oh, detectives.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.083
I have a box
of Martha's
stuff

09:05.166 --> 09:07.625
and no one to give it to.

09:07.709 --> 09:09.083
Sure.

09:09.166 --> 09:12.333
Look, I don't mean to make
Martha out to be some loser

09:12.417 --> 09:14.750
just because the dating
thing
didn't work out.

09:14.834 --> 09:16.208
It doesn't
always work out

09:16.291 --> 09:19.291
and it doesn't mean
something's wrong with you.

09:20.792 --> 09:22.458
Couldn't agree more.

09:27.250 --> 09:28.583
So, sorry..

09:31.917 --> 09:35.625
(Lilly)
'Ramon and Martha made contact
through this dating service.'

09:35.709 --> 09:38.917
He sees her tape, tries to
lure
her in and rip her off.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.750
You think it's impossible
he could have been interested

09:40.834 --> 09:43.000
because of how she looks?

09:43.083 --> 09:44.417
Yeah, impossible.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.583
I'm not sure I want
you
speaking for all men.

09:49.208 --> 09:51.291
"The Milkmaid's Manor?"

09:51.375 --> 09:52.667
Research.

09:52.750 --> 09:55.625
Prized possessions here
are all romance novels.

09:55.709 --> 09:57.166
She was obsessed
with these things.

09:57.250 --> 09:59.333
Only one of 'em
turned out to be her diary.

09:59.417 --> 10:01.333
Stuffed in a book jacket.

10:01.417 --> 10:04.125
(John)
'Hiding it.
Diary give us anything?'

10:04.208 --> 10:05.875
The novels got to her head.

10:05.959 --> 10:07.875
'She wanted a
man, big time.'

10:07.959 --> 10:09.500
Uh, the romantic fantasy

10:09.583 --> 10:11.625
is why Martha didn't listen
to Stephanie.

10:11.709 --> 10:13.875
did
with Ramon?

10:17.417 --> 10:19.333
January 16, 1989.

10:19.417 --> 10:23.750
Martha agrees to meet him
at "The Perfumed Rose."

10:23.834 --> 10:25.291
Exhibit A.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.583
"I told him I'd be the one
with the flower behind my
ear.

10:27.667 --> 10:31.542
"If he saw me and wanted
to walk the other way

10:31.625 --> 10:33.583
I swore my feelings
wouldn't be hurt."

11:12.250 --> 11:13.291
Martha.

11:14.417 --> 11:15.625
Ramon.

11:19.458 --> 11:21.750
Come here. Come here.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.917
When's the last time
you had a cheesesteak?

11:28.417 --> 11:30.583
Are you making fun of me?

11:30.667 --> 11:31.750
What?

11:31.834 --> 11:33.417
No. No.

11:33.500 --> 11:36.041
No, I asked because,
I know after we have

11:36.125 --> 11:39.083
a few drinks
and talk for a long time

11:39.166 --> 11:40.959
I'm gonna want a cheesesteak.

11:42.333 --> 11:43.375
Oh.

11:46.291 --> 11:48.000
Geno's.

11:48.083 --> 11:49.917
Okay.

11:50.041 --> 11:51.291
A lot of girls, they don't..

11:51.375 --> 11:53.583
They don't bother
with the cheesesteak.

11:53.667 --> 11:55.041
Gets old fast.

11:57.625 --> 12:00.792
I guess I'm probably not like
a lot of other girls.

12:00.875 --> 12:02.000
(Ramon)
'That's good.'

12:04.542 --> 12:06.959
That's why I'm here.

12:07.041 --> 12:08.625
I, um..

12:08.709 --> 12:10.959
I think it's great what you do.

12:11.041 --> 12:13.834
My parents died when I was ten.

12:13.917 --> 12:16.291
[gasps]
Oh, my goodness.

12:16.375 --> 12:18.667
- You were an orphan?
- Well, I..

12:18.750 --> 12:23.500
I didn't have like a little
tin cup and a crutch
but...yeah.

12:25.208 --> 12:27.917
Anyway, look,
I-I just wanted to tell you

12:28.000 --> 12:31.542
that it meant a lot to me
when...they fixed up my mom

12:31.625 --> 12:33.625
to look nice.
At the wake.

12:34.667 --> 12:37.834
That's why
I'm in Mortuary Studies.

12:39.834 --> 12:42.750
I felt the same way
my

12:42.834 --> 12:46.500
Oh.
Oh, yeah?

12:46.583 --> 12:49.333
(Martha)
'She had a stroke
when I was four.'

12:49.417 --> 12:50.834
Huh.

12:50.917 --> 12:53.917
I laid by her side for two days

12:54.000 --> 12:56.834
before a neighbor figured it
out
and called the cops.

13:01.166 --> 13:02.583
That's sad, Martha.

13:02.667 --> 13:04.250
No.

13:05.291 --> 13:06.917
It was peaceful.

13:08.166 --> 13:10.125
She was finally happy.

13:23.333 --> 13:24.458
How do I look?

13:25.458 --> 13:27.417
- 'Huh?'
- Very dashing.

13:30.083 --> 13:32.834
Um...manly.

13:36.458 --> 13:39.208
So Martha and Ramon hit it off.

13:39.291 --> 13:40.875
'Spite of him
being full of
it.

13:40.959 --> 13:44.291
Guy did alright.
All first date talk is
crap.

13:45.917 --> 13:48.375
Well, Martha
thought
Ramon was sincere.

13:48.458 --> 13:50.291
She slept with
him that night.

13:52.834 --> 13:54.500
Here's the last entry.

13:54.583 --> 13:56.875
"Today Ramon told me
the reason he was drawn to
me

13:56.959 --> 14:00.208
"is because I look
like his late
mother.

14:00.291 --> 14:02.917
'I never thought
I could be so happy."'

14:03.000 --> 14:05.083
Now is that
romantic or creepy?

14:06.875 --> 14:09.000
No, that's not the last entry.

14:09.083 --> 14:10.625
There's a space in the binding.

14:10.709 --> 14:12.583
Used to be other pages here.

14:12.667 --> 14:13.875
Did they fall out?

14:14.834 --> 14:16.083
Somebody took them out.

14:16.166 --> 14:18.375
Jeffries just
called.
He's got
something.

14:26.333 --> 14:29.333
Delgado had this storage
unit
since 1980.

14:42.709 --> 14:44.959
"Love Poetry
from the Early 19th Century."

14:46.625 --> 14:49.458
"Musings on Women."

14:49.542 --> 14:51.125
These are
seduction tools.

14:51.208 --> 14:53.041
Mm-hmm.

14:53.125 --> 14:55.542
Meet the seductees.

14:57.250 --> 14:58.959
What are we watching?

14:59.041 --> 15:02.333
Video dating tapes.
19 of them.

15:03.458 --> 15:04.667
(Lilly)
'Love Juncture.'

15:04.750 --> 15:06.417
'"Soul of a Lifetime."'

15:06.500 --> 15:07.750
"View and Woo."

15:07.834 --> 15:09.667
What was he doing with these?

15:09.750 --> 15:10.834
Targeting women.

15:11.917 --> 15:13.291
Credit card fraud?

15:13.375 --> 15:15.458
We ran the names on the tapes.

15:15.542 --> 15:17.500
Five of these women are dead.

15:21.875 --> 15:24.834
Martha Puck's dream man
wasn't just a con artist.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.834
He was a serial killer.

16:15.709 --> 16:16.667
Hey.

16:16.750 --> 16:17.792
Hey.

16:19.125 --> 16:20.875
6 o'clock in the morning.

16:20.959 --> 16:22.792
You say it
like I don't know
that.

16:24.625 --> 16:26.041
You got a name, kid?

16:26.959 --> 16:28.709
Andre.

16:28.792 --> 16:30.750
How 'bout you
give it a rest, Andre.

16:31.959 --> 16:33.875
How 'bout you put some pants on?

16:35.417 --> 16:37.291
I'm a cop, smart-ass.

16:37.375 --> 16:40.542
So what you going to do, homes?
Arrest me?

17:04.417 --> 17:07.000
Ramon Delgado
had video dating tapes

17:07.083 --> 17:08.667
on each one of these women.

17:08.750 --> 17:11.250
From five different dating
services where he was a
client.

17:11.333 --> 17:15.041
And each of these women died in
a hit-and-run accident in 1989.

17:15.125 --> 17:16.959
(Lilly)
'Crossed state lines
to hide his tracks.'

17:17.041 --> 17:20.375
One in Jersey, one in New York,
the rest in Philly.

17:20.458 --> 17:22.291
'Nobody made the connect.'

17:22.375 --> 17:24.041
Any witnesses?

17:24.125 --> 17:25.041
(Scotty)
'One.'

17:25.125 --> 17:26.583
Crackhead named Cherry LeSure

17:26.667 --> 17:28.125
saw victim number one,
Buella Stiffler

17:28.208 --> 17:29.709
'get mowed down
in the Badlands.'

17:29.792 --> 17:31.375
(Lilly)
'Cherry said she saw..'

17:31.458 --> 17:34.625
- "Bells and bubbles."
- Why do we write it down?

17:34.709 --> 17:36.125
(John)
'So that was Delgado's MO.'

17:36.208 --> 17:37.917
He hit their bank accounts,
then he hit them.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.583
These five emptied
their bank accounts themselves

17:40.667 --> 17:41.875
a day before
they were killed.

17:41.959 --> 17:43.875
Well, Delgado convinced
them to do it.

17:43.959 --> 17:45.917
- How?
- 'Well, look at 'em.'

17:46.000 --> 17:48.375
Not exactly the seasoned
dating types.

17:48.458 --> 17:50.959
You track down any of the other
women from his tape collection?

17:51.041 --> 17:55.125
Yeah, found a live one,
uh, Eugenia Karpathian.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.041
Always liked fishing a lot.

17:57.125 --> 18:00.583
But what with water pollution
what it is these days

18:00.667 --> 18:01.875
'we can't eat
what we catch so..'

18:01.959 --> 18:03.375
Well, see what
Eugenia
can tell you

18:03.458 --> 18:06.208
about Ramon and his magic.

18:11.125 --> 18:14.333
Six tons of plush toys
can't deliver themselves,
guys.

18:17.792 --> 18:21.750
Well, he was good-looking.
At least I got that excuse.

18:21.834 --> 18:24.667
Eugenia, did Ramon Delgado
ever make you feel threatened?

18:24.750 --> 18:26.208
Uh, in danger?

18:26.291 --> 18:29.125
Au contraire.
He was sugar and spice.

18:29.208 --> 18:32.667
How do you think he convinced me
to let him invest my savings?

18:32.750 --> 18:35.041
Invested it, alright,
into his own pocket.

18:35.125 --> 18:36.500
You never reported it?

18:36.583 --> 18:38.834
Would've, if it weren't
half my fault

18:38.917 --> 18:40.291
fallin' for his BS.

18:40.375 --> 18:43.166
He ever say anything
to you about other women?

18:43.250 --> 18:44.417
He didn't have to say.

18:44.500 --> 18:47.166
After he wronged me,
I staked out his place.

18:47.250 --> 18:49.458
Sure enough
there was a new girl.

18:49.542 --> 18:51.333
Floral print-type.

19:02.291 --> 19:04.166
You don't know me,
technically

19:04.250 --> 19:07.375
but you and I
are one in the same.

19:07.458 --> 19:08.709
I have to go
to the pretzels now.

19:08.792 --> 19:11.208
No.
Ramon Delgado.

19:11.291 --> 19:13.083
He took me for all I'm worth.

19:13.166 --> 19:15.333
And he'll do the same to you.

19:15.417 --> 19:16.917
I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.333
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, I'm a single mom.

19:19.417 --> 19:22.208
I got my boy
asking for soccer
camp

19:22.291 --> 19:23.917
and I can't
even
give him sauce

19:24.000 --> 19:27.041
for his noodles
since Ramon cleaned me out.

19:27.125 --> 19:29.583
I'm sorry if he hurt you.

19:29.667 --> 19:31.750
But it's different
with me and Ramon.

19:31.834 --> 19:35.000
So...I don't need your warning.

19:37.667 --> 19:39.458
"You look like
my dead ma."

19:40.500 --> 19:43.000
He say that to you?

19:43.083 --> 19:45.208
'Next he'll ask
for a key to your place.'

19:45.291 --> 19:48.083
Stuff will disappear.
He'll borrow your car.

19:48.166 --> 19:50.291
'It'll get stolen.'

19:50.375 --> 19:51.875
(Stephanie)
'What's going on?'

19:54.542 --> 19:58.083
- She knows Ramon.
- You got to have hope.

19:58.166 --> 20:00.917
Just because
we ain't Morgan Fairchild

20:01.000 --> 20:03.250
doesn't mean
we don't deserve somebody nice.

20:03.333 --> 20:05.208
Martha, who is this?

20:06.333 --> 20:07.917
We got to go home.

20:11.709 --> 20:14.291
Poor Martha.
I've been there.

20:14.375 --> 20:17.000
One day you're on vacation
in denial city

20:17.083 --> 20:20.208
next day you're in a prison
of your own stupidity.

20:21.583 --> 20:23.250
Thanks, Eugenia.

20:26.375 --> 20:27.875
Well, Stephanie,
the roommate lied

20:27.959 --> 20:29.917
about Martha and Ramon.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.625
Said they didn't
follow up.

20:31.709 --> 20:34.166
Well, this guy was
a "Svengali" with the
ladies.

20:34.250 --> 20:36.917
Maybe Stephanie fell
for his shtick, too?

20:38.750 --> 20:42.542
Oh, please. Protect Ramon?
I couldn't stand him.

20:42.625 --> 20:44.959
Oh, you think you can
just pick and choose

20:45.041 --> 20:46.125
what you tell us?

20:47.417 --> 20:50.041
I have a reputation you know.

20:50.125 --> 20:51.583
As what?

20:51.667 --> 20:54.542
The kind of men
I date, have money

20:54.625 --> 20:58.000
and prestige, and they do
background checks.

20:58.083 --> 21:00.834
If they found out
that I lived with a thief

21:00.917 --> 21:03.750
all of this...means nothing.

21:05.041 --> 21:07.125
"Thief."
Oh, you mean Ramon?

21:10.041 --> 21:11.458
Martha?

21:15.750 --> 21:19.083
Look, Martha was your roommate.

21:19.166 --> 21:21.667
Doesn't mean she
reflects on you.

21:21.750 --> 21:25.291
I can tell you're...classy.

21:25.375 --> 21:26.417
True.

21:27.583 --> 21:30.500
So you can imagine how I felt.

21:30.583 --> 21:31.959
Felt when?

21:32.041 --> 21:35.959
The day that lady with the
braid
saw us at the supermarket.

21:36.041 --> 21:37.583
We raced home..

21:38.542 --> 21:40.709
...and Martha, she just..

21:42.000 --> 21:43.917
...transformed.

21:50.959 --> 21:52.083
Baby.

21:53.792 --> 21:56.041
This thing's out of
whack,
I was-I was gonna run
it

21:56.125 --> 21:58.166
down to my buddy's shop
and get it fixed before

21:58.250 --> 22:00.542
"Murphy Brown" comes on.

22:00.625 --> 22:02.834
Steph, will you
just give us a sec?

22:13.250 --> 22:16.208
I know you don't
really love me.

22:16.291 --> 22:20.333
You lied to me for two weeks
to take my frickin' TV?

22:28.834 --> 22:30.333
You can't call the cops.

22:31.667 --> 22:33.250
They can't prove it.

22:36.458 --> 22:37.625
Please, don't go.

22:40.333 --> 22:42.000
I can't get over you.

22:43.917 --> 22:46.000
It would be too hard.

22:46.083 --> 22:47.792
I dreamt about you.

22:49.166 --> 22:50.583
And then you were here.

22:50.667 --> 22:52.417
And now I'm gone.

22:52.500 --> 22:54.375
'Cause I got what I need.

22:55.333 --> 22:56.792
You could get more.

22:57.709 --> 22:59.208
From the girls.

23:00.166 --> 23:01.667
That you lie to.

23:06.291 --> 23:08.000
Oh, yeah?

23:08.083 --> 23:09.583
You can marry them.

23:12.375 --> 23:15.542
- Why would I do that?
- It's all we want.

23:16.875 --> 23:19.875
To have somebody
say that we're the one.

23:21.125 --> 23:23.709
If you do that,
we'll give you anything.

23:23.792 --> 23:25.500
Anything like what?

23:27.500 --> 23:29.250
Secret stashes.

23:29.333 --> 23:31.375
We have 'em..

23:31.458 --> 23:34.166
...because we think
we're gonna be alone forever.

23:34.250 --> 23:35.875
So I take the money..

23:35.959 --> 23:37.625
...then I got a wife.

23:37.709 --> 23:38.750
Forget it.

23:38.834 --> 23:41.333
- Divorce her.
- That's too messy.

23:42.458 --> 23:44.458
Get rid of her.

23:47.542 --> 23:49.458
<i>babe.</i>

23:49.542 --> 23:51.208
<i>jail.</i>

23:51.291 --> 23:53.000
We can think of a way.

23:55.083 --> 23:57.542
For us to get away with it.

23:59.417 --> 24:00.458
Us?

24:01.750 --> 24:05.959
People die every day
crossing the street.

24:08.125 --> 24:09.917
Martha.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.417
Ramon.

24:14.917 --> 24:18.291
Obviously, she wasn't serious
about taking anybody out.

24:18.375 --> 24:20.750
Oh, obviously.

24:21.834 --> 24:24.250
"People die
crossing the street."

24:24.333 --> 24:27.000
That's how our five
women were taken out.

24:27.083 --> 24:29.458
Hit-and-runs were Martha's idea.

24:29.542 --> 24:31.000
She wasn't Ramon's victim.

24:31.917 --> 24:33.417
She was his accomplice.

24:40.291 --> 24:42.875
Well, this is a
big,
fat waste of
time.

24:42.959 --> 24:44.500
Solving
a murderer's
murder.

24:44.583 --> 24:46.542
Case gets closed
...all five of them.

24:46.625 --> 24:48.458
Doesn't matter how we feel
about the victim.

24:48.542 --> 24:50.458
She's not a
victim.
She's a psycho.

24:50.542 --> 24:52.125
She did it for love.

24:52.208 --> 24:53.875
Love with a two-bit hood.

24:53.959 --> 24:57.000
Ramon wasn't pickin' anyone off
until Martha came in.

24:58.875 --> 25:01.417
That's my piece.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.834
I found a pattern in the
victims' credit card charges.

25:04.917 --> 25:07.417
Day she died,
Buella Stiffler made a
purchase

25:07.500 --> 25:09.583
at a florist in New Jersey.

25:09.667 --> 25:12.250
Anastasia Farelli went
to the beauty parlor.

25:12.333 --> 25:15.959
And Petunia Marshall
got a five-point wax.

25:16.041 --> 25:18.208
(Lilly)
'Uh, it's Martha's
wedding plan in action.'

25:18.291 --> 25:19.583
Flowers, the primping.

25:19.667 --> 25:21.583
Purchases were made
on the day they died.

25:21.667 --> 25:23.250
He was marrying them
and then kills 'em

25:23.333 --> 25:24.583
before they
have to pay for a honeymoon.

25:24.667 --> 25:26.375
They did the ceremony,
offed the girls

25:26.458 --> 25:27.792
and never filed the paperwork.

25:27.875 --> 25:29.250
Which would explain
why there's no record

25:29.333 --> 25:30.750
of Ramon Delgado being married.

25:30.834 --> 25:32.166
I called the florist
in Atlantic City

25:32.250 --> 25:33.375
where Buella used her card.

25:33.458 --> 25:35.250
They said they do
a lot of orders

25:35.333 --> 25:36.792
for the quickie chapel
next door.

25:36.875 --> 25:38.917
Midnight Love Chapel,
it's called.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.875
I'll send Nick and Scotty
down there.

25:53.875 --> 25:55.000
Hey.

25:57.125 --> 25:59.917
I can do it, but it's not
legal
in this state.

26:02.208 --> 26:05.792
Yeah, I remember Rico Suave
and the two big girls.

26:05.875 --> 26:08.750
Uh, Buella and Serena.

26:10.458 --> 26:13.542
Was this "Serena" by any chance?

26:13.625 --> 26:16.375
Yep, that's her.
Serena Montagne.

26:16.458 --> 26:18.250
The groom's sister.

26:18.333 --> 26:19.458
Sister?

26:19.542 --> 26:23.000
Uh, tell us about Serena
and her brother Ramon.

26:23.083 --> 26:25.500
I've seen
some wacky couples in here

26:25.583 --> 26:29.000
but that brother
and sister duo make my Top
Five.

26:38.417 --> 26:40.000
You two don't look alike.

26:40.083 --> 26:41.917
- I'm adopted.
- I'm adopted.

26:43.250 --> 26:44.625
I'm adopted.

26:48.250 --> 26:49.750
- Hey, baby.
- Hmm?

26:49.834 --> 26:52.250
Maybe you should check the
girls' room. Maybe she
split.

26:52.333 --> 26:53.709
No, she's coming, Ramon.

26:53.792 --> 26:55.083
She's been in there 40 minutes.

26:55.166 --> 26:57.500
What'd you say to her?

26:57.583 --> 26:59.792
The first time you saw her tape

26:59.875 --> 27:02.208
it was like you
got tunnel vision

27:02.291 --> 27:04.625
and all you could see was her

27:04.709 --> 27:06.500
and then you called me
from a payphone

27:06.583 --> 27:09.834
and you said,
"Sis, I can't believe it.

27:09.917 --> 27:11.667
I think I found the one."

27:15.959 --> 27:17.291
That's nice.

27:22.208 --> 27:23.875
You look hot in a hat.

27:27.917 --> 27:29.375
I wish it were me.

27:30.250 --> 27:32.834
Walkin' down the aisle to you.

27:34.792 --> 27:36.667
Wouldn't mom be proud?

27:49.959 --> 27:52.417
[giggles]
Well, hi.

28:01.834 --> 28:03.709
Serena Montagne,
name Martha used

28:03.792 --> 28:05.417
it's from one of her
romance novels.

28:05.500 --> 28:06.500
Oh, no kiddin'.

28:06.583 --> 28:08.250
Yeah, a busty milkmaid

28:08.333 --> 28:09.583
finds out she's a princess.

28:09.667 --> 28:11.959
Isn't that always the way?
Thanks a lot.

28:17.834 --> 28:19.083
Hey, these bubbles?

28:19.166 --> 28:21.959
Yep. Less mess than birdseed.

28:23.333 --> 28:25.250
Were you givin'
these away in
'89?

28:25.333 --> 28:26.959
Since we opened.

28:27.041 --> 28:28.208
Help yourself.

28:29.959 --> 28:31.959
Bells and bubbles.

28:32.041 --> 28:34.667
For free.
It's your lucky day.

28:34.750 --> 28:36.500
A crackhead who saw
Buella's hit-and-run

28:36.583 --> 28:38.458
talked about
bells and
bubbles.

28:41.750 --> 28:44.125
(Will)
'We're looking
for a Cherry LeSure.'

28:44.208 --> 28:47.291
I'm outta breath
from runnin' over here.

28:47.375 --> 28:50.000
My girlfriend said there was
a delicious scoop o' chocolate

28:50.083 --> 28:51.709
in a suit lookin' for me.

28:52.208 --> 28:53.625
Hello.

28:57.125 --> 28:58.542
Cherry LeSure?

28:58.625 --> 29:00.625
Detectives Jeffries and Rush.

29:00.709 --> 29:03.542
Back in '89, you saw
a hit-and-run down here.

29:03.625 --> 29:05.500
Big girl, Buella Stiffler.

29:05.583 --> 29:07.500
Dark days for me.

29:07.583 --> 29:10.083
You recall the incident or not?

29:10.166 --> 29:12.542
He always this feisty?

29:12.625 --> 29:14.917
I told them boys
in blue what I saw.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.291
They chose not to listen.

29:16.375 --> 29:17.500
Feisty.

29:17.583 --> 29:20.959
Uh, you described seeing
...bells and bubbles.

29:21.041 --> 29:24.291
That's right. 'Cause they
were
doin' a housewarming party.

29:24.375 --> 29:25.375
What do you mean?

29:25.458 --> 29:27.458
It's crazy,
but they came down here

29:27.542 --> 29:29.417
and acted like
they found paradise.

29:34.458 --> 29:35.500
(Ramon)
'Watch your step.'

29:36.583 --> 29:38.000
(Ramon)
'You ready?'

29:38.083 --> 29:39.250
Oh, there you go.

29:39.333 --> 29:41.667
Keep them closed.
No looking.

29:41.750 --> 29:43.291
You guys are hysterical.

29:43.375 --> 29:45.250
[giggling]
Where are we?

29:45.333 --> 29:47.166
Oh, you'll see in a sec.
No looking.

29:47.250 --> 29:49.333
- Okay.
- 'Okay..'

29:51.667 --> 29:53.166
Home sweet home.

29:55.375 --> 29:58.208
This is what we put
our down payment on?

29:59.083 --> 30:00.542
You're kidding, right?

30:00.625 --> 30:02.709
You have to use your
imagination, Buella.

30:02.792 --> 30:04.000
I mean, it's not built yet

30:04.083 --> 30:06.583
but, oh, it's going
to be beautiful.

30:06.667 --> 30:08.583
You know what?
Here we go.

30:12.834 --> 30:15.458
Oh! I just carried
you
over the threshold.

30:15.542 --> 30:17.125
- 'You did?'
- 'I did.'

30:17.208 --> 30:19.125
Close your eyes
so you can picture
it.

30:19.208 --> 30:20.542
- Okay.
- Okay? They closed?

30:20.625 --> 30:22.083
- Yes. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

30:22.166 --> 30:24.375
There's the front door.

30:24.458 --> 30:28.875
There's the little stone path
leading up to a little fence.

30:28.959 --> 30:30.417
Little front yard.

30:30.500 --> 30:31.917
Seriously?

30:32.000 --> 30:33.500
Like with bushes and stuff?

30:33.583 --> 30:35.375
Keep 'em closed.

30:35.458 --> 30:37.542
- Keep 'em closed.
- Alright.

30:37.625 --> 30:39.875
Yes, with bushes and stuff.

30:42.041 --> 30:43.500
I love you.

31:02.208 --> 31:04.000
- Hey. Hey.
- Oh, my God!

31:04.083 --> 31:05.417
- Oh, my God.
- Martha.

31:05.500 --> 31:07.834
'Stop crying. Martha,
Martha, stop crying.'

31:08.667 --> 31:10.583
That was fantastic.

31:10.667 --> 31:13.542
You were freakin' gorgeous
just then.

31:13.625 --> 31:14.792
Really?

31:14.875 --> 31:16.667
This stuff becomes you, baby.

31:24.875 --> 31:28.417
You sure that wasn't a vision
from your crack pipe, Cherry?

31:28.500 --> 31:30.125
That's what happened.

31:30.208 --> 31:32.083
Big girl's shakin' like a leaf

31:32.166 --> 31:34.625
but she took
that other broad out.

31:34.709 --> 31:35.667
Bam!

31:38.875 --> 31:41.792
Come see my show
at The Manhole, Tuesday night.

31:41.875 --> 31:43.959
It's slammin', girl.

31:44.041 --> 31:46.250
And give Chocolove my flyer.

31:48.083 --> 31:50.458
Sure. Thanks, Cherry.

31:54.458 --> 31:56.959
For you...Chocolove.

31:58.333 --> 31:59.500
That was Vera.

31:59.583 --> 32:00.667
Ran Martha's alias

32:00.750 --> 32:02.875
Serena Montagne
and got a hit.

32:02.959 --> 32:05.583
She used it for something
other
than marriage certificates?

32:05.667 --> 32:08.875
Turns out Serena took out
a life insurance policy.

32:08.959 --> 32:10.000
On who?

32:10.083 --> 32:12.000
Ramon Delgado.

32:12.083 --> 32:14.125
I Guess Martha got
the hang of the con
game.

32:14.208 --> 32:16.166
And decided to
step it up a notch

32:16.250 --> 32:17.959
take out her true love.

32:22.041 --> 32:24.291
(Nick)
'So Martha tried to turn
the tables on Ramon.'

32:24.375 --> 32:25.542
Scam the scammer.

32:25.625 --> 32:26.792
Maybe he found out.

32:26.875 --> 32:27.917
And he took her out first.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
She was deep in the game.

32:29.083 --> 32:30.500
Her fake name,
Serena Montagne

32:30.583 --> 32:31.792
she used it
for a lot more than

32:31.875 --> 32:33.709
the life insurance policy
on Ramon.

32:33.792 --> 32:35.125
Credit cards.

32:35.208 --> 32:36.750
And a safe
deposit
box.

32:36.834 --> 32:38.166
And guess what was in it?

32:38.250 --> 32:40.417
- Other half of the diary.
- What'd she give us?

32:40.500 --> 32:42.959
Writes about Buella Stiffler
and the four other women

32:43.041 --> 32:44.458
she and Ramon murdered.

32:44.542 --> 32:46.792
Any insight
into Martha's murder?

32:46.875 --> 32:49.208
Nothing caught up with them
from their crime spree.

32:49.291 --> 32:51.750
Except Martha's conscience.

32:51.834 --> 32:54.458
<i>(Martha)</i>
<i>"My dear love.</i>

32:54.542 --> 32:57.542
'"May you keep track
of every second'

32:57.625 --> 33:00.667
'"that we are together
on this Earth.'

33:01.792 --> 33:04.542
"Your husband, Edwin.

33:05.625 --> 33:07.333
1947."

33:10.792 --> 33:12.458
This is so romantic.

33:13.458 --> 33:14.625
(Ramon)
'What?'

33:15.667 --> 33:16.917
And we took it.

33:18.750 --> 33:21.959
This is someone's
heirloom of love.

33:22.041 --> 33:24.417
This loser's
into ferns.

33:24.500 --> 33:26.083
You know anything
about that?

33:28.375 --> 33:30.834
I don't think I want
to do it anymore.

33:37.875 --> 33:39.333
Martha needs a rubdown.

33:41.333 --> 33:43.333
I've become
a terrible person.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.041
And for what?

33:47.125 --> 33:49.000
So that I can pretend
to be your sister

33:49.083 --> 33:52.834
while some girl who thinks
she's
your wife climbs all over you?

33:52.917 --> 33:54.709
Hey, hey.

33:54.792 --> 33:56.875
You think I like it?

33:56.959 --> 33:57.875
Huh?

33:57.959 --> 33:59.500
But we can't quit.

34:01.500 --> 34:03.375
Think I need to go for a walk.

34:03.458 --> 34:04.834
Martha.

34:04.917 --> 34:06.041
Come on, baby.

34:07.333 --> 34:09.834
What we have
is special.

34:09.917 --> 34:12.458
We are Bonnie and Clyde.

34:12.542 --> 34:15.250
And it feels good, right?

34:15.333 --> 34:16.792
It doesn't.

34:22.500 --> 34:23.583
You don't like us?

34:24.458 --> 34:25.834
You don't like me?

34:27.625 --> 34:29.166
I don't like me.

34:35.875 --> 34:37.625
Let's get married.

34:42.125 --> 34:43.583
You want a wife?

34:44.750 --> 34:46.166
I want you.

34:49.083 --> 34:53.875
The second I saw you,
I got tunnel vision.

34:53.959 --> 34:55.041
'And I knew..'

34:56.083 --> 34:57.375
...you were the one.

35:02.083 --> 35:03.583
Martha Puck..

35:04.667 --> 35:06.208
...will you marry me?

35:18.041 --> 35:20.125
(Nick)
'"Ramon only marries a girl
when he's ready'

35:20.208 --> 35:21.667
'"to get rid of her for good.'

35:21.750 --> 35:24.667
I've got to get him
before he gets me."

35:24.750 --> 35:26.834
Martha's, Serena Montagne
credit card

35:26.917 --> 35:30.375
had three charges on it
the week after she was shot.

35:30.458 --> 35:31.750
Ramon used it?

35:31.834 --> 35:33.250
Take a look
at the charges.

35:33.333 --> 35:35.291
"Grocery store,
clothing boutique

35:35.375 --> 35:37.375
Pee Wee Soccer Camp."

35:37.458 --> 35:38.875
Soccer camp?

35:38.959 --> 35:40.917
Eugenia said she wanted
to send her son there

35:41.000 --> 35:42.875
before Ramon cleaned her out.

35:42.959 --> 35:46.333
Martha dies and Eugenia's luck
turns around.

35:52.709 --> 35:56.542
The thing about Martha
is,
she was frustrating.

35:56.625 --> 35:59.875
Some women, they think
so low of themselves

35:59.959 --> 36:01.166
gets them into trouble.

36:01.250 --> 36:03.792
You mean you weren't
angry with Martha?

36:03.875 --> 36:07.291
Well...I was disappointed.

36:07.375 --> 36:10.166
Disappointed doesn't explain
taking credit cards

36:10.250 --> 36:12.250
off her dead body
and using them to buy things.

36:12.333 --> 36:13.417
Whoa, whoa.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.333
I got to stop you right there.

36:15.417 --> 36:17.083
I don't do killing.

36:17.166 --> 36:18.125
(Lilly)
'Now, that's too bad.'

36:18.208 --> 36:19.500
'Cause if you did maybe Ramon

36:19.583 --> 36:20.917
wouldn't have dumped you.

36:23.291 --> 36:25.709
I wouldn't say he dumped me.

36:25.792 --> 36:27.375
I wouldn't use that word.

36:27.458 --> 36:30.125
Well, it was
meant to be, though.

36:30.208 --> 36:33.750
'Him and Martha were
the real love match.'

36:33.834 --> 36:36.166
Well, there's
no accounting for taste.

36:38.750 --> 36:40.291
You still love him.

36:44.250 --> 36:46.667
Oh, go ahead and judge me.

36:46.750 --> 36:48.750
You don't know
what it's like to be a woman

36:48.834 --> 36:52.458
and want somebody to love you,
but you're too old

36:52.542 --> 36:57.792
you're too fat, you're too
loud,
you're too something.

36:57.875 --> 36:59.625
And every damn thing hurts
your feelings

36:59.709 --> 37:01.500
like it's the end of the world.

37:05.250 --> 37:06.625
And you.

37:08.500 --> 37:10.917
We might as well be
from different planets.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.834
Martha was planning
on killing Ramon.

37:13.917 --> 37:15.458
You found out about that.

37:15.542 --> 37:17.959
Guy like that?
You don't toss that out.

37:18.041 --> 37:19.667
He was using her
just like he used you.

37:19.750 --> 37:21.166
I wish!

37:21.250 --> 37:23.583
After she was gone
I told him I'd be

37:23.667 --> 37:25.917
his new Bonnie,
he could be my Clyde.

37:28.208 --> 37:31.458
But he couldn't
get over losing Martha.

37:31.542 --> 37:34.625
He was watching her tape
when he killed himself.

37:41.667 --> 37:45.375
Some people
get lucky with love..

37:45.458 --> 37:46.583
...some people don't.

37:47.709 --> 37:49.208
That's life.

37:52.417 --> 37:54.792
How did you know
about Martha's plan?

37:58.083 --> 37:59.458
She called me up.

38:01.083 --> 38:04.291
Said I was the only person
she could really confide in.

38:06.083 --> 38:07.291
'Cause us two..

38:10.417 --> 38:13.583
...we knew what it was like
to be under his spell.

38:23.250 --> 38:26.375
Thank you so much
for meeting me here.

38:26.458 --> 38:28.500
I know it's
out of your way

38:28.583 --> 38:30.917
but I don't want Ramon
to find me.

38:31.792 --> 38:33.709
Smells good, doesn't it?

38:34.625 --> 38:37.291
It's deep dish place.

38:37.375 --> 38:40.250
I'm guessing your problem
has
something to do with Ramon.

38:41.458 --> 38:43.542
He wants to get rid of me.

38:43.625 --> 38:46.375
<i>kill you?</i>

38:48.625 --> 38:50.250
He's not that bad.

38:51.166 --> 38:53.542
Yes, he is.

38:53.625 --> 38:55.375
Oh, Eugenia.

38:56.792 --> 38:58.500
We've done things.

39:00.375 --> 39:02.083
I just lost my way.

39:05.125 --> 39:06.500
"We?"

39:07.250 --> 39:09.959
I helped him steal and..

39:11.542 --> 39:13.625
...do horrible..

39:14.917 --> 39:16.500
...terrible things.

39:17.917 --> 39:19.291
You and him?

39:20.792 --> 39:22.750
'Huh.'

39:22.834 --> 39:24.166
So, uh..

39:25.166 --> 39:27.000
What, you live together?

39:29.500 --> 39:30.834
I'm gonna kill him.

39:48.041 --> 39:49.500
Can I touch it?

39:52.583 --> 39:54.542
(Martha)
'I have
life insurance on him'

39:54.625 --> 39:58.083
'and I am giving the money
to you and your son.'

39:58.166 --> 40:01.792
'Cause I want to make it
right,
what happened to you.

40:04.417 --> 40:07.125
Did he ever tell you
you had beautiful hair?

40:07.875 --> 40:09.625
I don't think so.

40:11.959 --> 40:15.000
Yeah, well, he, uh
...he told me that.

40:17.125 --> 40:18.583
You do have nice hair.

40:20.166 --> 40:21.875
'Can you put
the gun down?'

40:24.417 --> 40:27.959
I can't really stand it
if you kill him.

40:28.041 --> 40:29.834
'Cause maybe, if you don't
want him then, uh--

40:29.917 --> 40:32.000
What? Eugenia!

40:33.041 --> 40:35.500
He's a bad person.

40:35.583 --> 40:37.375
'He isn't good enough for you.'

40:39.750 --> 40:41.667
Well, he's all there is.

40:41.750 --> 40:43.166
But what about hope?

40:43.250 --> 40:44.667
'You said there would be
someone nice.'

40:44.750 --> 40:46.375
I'm sick of saying that!

40:48.041 --> 40:50.375
It's bad enough to have..

40:50.458 --> 40:53.875
...every damn
ad,
song, TV show

40:53.959 --> 40:57.959
lying to you about how anybody
can find true love.

40:58.041 --> 41:02.041
But I am so sick
of lying to myself.

41:02.125 --> 41:03.625
Oh, Eugenia.

41:05.208 --> 41:07.250
Don't give up.

41:07.333 --> 41:10.417
'Love could find you
when you least expect it.'

41:10.500 --> 41:14.709
You could be sitting in the
park
one day, reading a book..

41:14.792 --> 41:17.500
'Cause I am so...damn..

41:18.458 --> 41:19.667
...tired.
