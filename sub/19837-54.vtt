<b>Fortunes x Aren't x Right?</b>

02:20.030 --> 02:21.690
<b>Ready, go!</b>

02:30.470 --> 02:31.670
<b>Kurapika!</b>

02:34.800 --> 02:36.100
<b>This is great.</b>

02:36.100 --> 02:36.940
<b>Huh?</b>

02:36.940 --> 02:38.590
<b>The spiders are dead,</b>

02:38.590 --> 02:41.930
<b>so you can finally focus on your main goal.</b>

02:42.340 --> 02:45.680
<b>You have to find the eyes of your people.</b>

02:46.510 --> 02:47.410
<b>Gon...</b>

02:48.350 --> 02:49.090
<b>Yep.</b>

02:49.630 --> 02:52.580
<b>If there's anything we can do to helpâ€”</b>

02:54.520 --> 02:55.700
<b>Hey!</b>

02:56.200 --> 02:57.930
<b>You did it first.</b>

02:57.930 --> 02:58.940
<b>I was getting revenge!</b>

02:58.940 --> 03:00.690
<b>But I didn't do it on purpose.</b>

03:00.690 --> 03:02.950
<b>You did it deliberately!</b>

03:10.210 --> 03:11.790
<b>Why are you so upset?</b>

03:12.350 --> 03:16.840
<b>We sold that piece for 355 million Jenny!</b>

03:17.150 --> 03:20.210
<b>It could have sold for more...</b>

03:20.210 --> 03:21.630
<b>We got a decent price!</b>

03:21.630 --> 03:26.850
<b>No, we could have gotten over 400 
million if we'd sold at a different time.</b>

03:27.170 --> 03:29.100
<b>We had bad luck...</b>

03:29.330 --> 03:31.170
<b>You sure take this seriously.</b>

03:31.700 --> 03:35.820
<b>It isn't like you would've gotten anything 
if we'd gotten a better price.</b>

03:35.820 --> 03:37.640
<b>That's not the issue here.</b>

03:38.230 --> 03:42.610
<b>If we run with the money, 
we'd each get a 170 million cut!</b>

03:44.310 --> 03:47.620
<b>Are you really friends with Gon and Killua?</b>

03:47.620 --> 03:49.260
<b>I was joking.</b>

03:49.900 --> 03:50.860
<b>Hello?</b>

03:51.510 --> 03:53.270
<b>Oh, Kurapika!</b>

04:02.280 --> 04:04.800
<b>It's been a while since we 
were all together last!</b>

04:04.800 --> 04:05.700
<b>Yeah.</b>

04:06.970 --> 04:08.440
<b>Where's Zepile-san?</b>

04:08.440 --> 04:10.080
<b>He wanted to validate our check</b>

04:10.080 --> 04:12.770
<b>and find more hidden gems to sell.</b>

04:13.030 --> 04:14.340
<b>Anyway...</b>

04:14.920 --> 04:15.780
<b>What?</b>

04:16.230 --> 04:18.770
<b>You've got this intensity about you...</b>

04:18.770 --> 04:21.400
<b>You seem a little more intimidating now.</b>

04:21.400 --> 04:22.690
<b>Really?</b>

04:23.180 --> 04:25.710
<b>You don't seem to have changed much.</b>

04:25.710 --> 04:27.940
<b>And you're more annoying, too!</b>

04:29.630 --> 04:33.000
<b>Oh, I heard that you defeated 
a member of the Troupe.</b>

04:33.000 --> 04:36.130
<b>Having only just learned <i>Nen</i>, 
how did you manage that?</b>

04:37.050 --> 04:41.980
<b>If you're looking for advice 
on catching the spiders,</b>

04:41.980 --> 04:43.170
<b>then stop.</b>

04:43.430 --> 04:45.360
<b>That's not the only reason.</b>

04:45.360 --> 04:48.070
<b>We want to master <i>Nen</i>.</b>

04:48.590 --> 04:52.590
<b>Because we'll definitely 
need <i>Nen</i> in the future.</b>

04:53.270 --> 04:55.390
<b>Then you don't want my advice.</b>

04:55.920 --> 04:58.280
<b>It won't do you any good.</b>

04:58.280 --> 04:59.190
<b>Why not?</b>

05:00.080 --> 05:03.940
<b>My power can only be 
used against the Troupe.</b>

05:03.940 --> 05:04.750
<b>Huh?</b>

05:07.670 --> 05:09.700
<b>Restraint and vow?</b>

05:09.700 --> 05:10.640
<b>Yeah.</b>

05:11.350 --> 05:14.710
<b><i>Nen</i> is strongly affected by your mental state.</b>

05:15.080 --> 05:17.630
<b>The stronger your resolve, 
the more power you receive.</b>

05:17.970 --> 05:21.710
<b>However, you also incur a 
big risk at the same time.</b>

05:22.230 --> 05:24.830
<b>In return for <i>Nen</i> power,</b>

05:24.830 --> 05:27.870
<b>I vowed to use it against the spiders alone.</b>

05:27.870 --> 05:29.970
<b>I established a rule for myself.</b>

05:30.270 --> 05:32.900
<b>What's the rule?</b>

05:32.900 --> 05:36.730
<b>If I use my chains on one who isn't a spider,</b>

05:37.420 --> 05:39.480
<b>I will forfeit my life.</b>

05:40.860 --> 05:42.920
<b>Huh? What do you mean?</b>

05:43.350 --> 05:47.420
<b>There is a <i>Nen</i> blade pointed at my heart.</b>

05:47.860 --> 05:49.440
<b>If I break the rule,</b>

05:49.440 --> 05:53.120
<b>that blade will pierce my heart, killing me.</b>

05:54.440 --> 05:56.890
<b>This is the rule that shows my resolve.</b>

05:56.890 --> 05:58.870
<b>Restraint and vow.</b>

05:59.470 --> 06:04.080
<b>My power is the product of pure hatred.</b>

06:04.080 --> 06:07.010
<b>It only works on the spiders.</b>

06:07.370 --> 06:09.010
<b>I'm telling you because I trust you.</b>

06:09.670 --> 06:11.160
<b>Don't tell anyone else.</b>

06:11.700 --> 06:12.840
<b>Why...</b>

06:13.140 --> 06:15.770
<b>Why would you tell us something so important?!</b>

06:19.060 --> 06:20.700
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

06:21.720 --> 06:25.780
<b>With their leader's death, 
I must have relaxed.</b>

06:26.030 --> 06:28.110
<b>It'll be fine if we keep our mouths shut.</b>

06:28.690 --> 06:30.030
<b>It's too dangerous.</b>

06:30.030 --> 06:33.780
<b>One of the surviving members can read minds.</b>

06:34.570 --> 06:38.660
<b>If they find out, Kurapika won't 
be able to beat them!</b>

06:38.660 --> 06:41.490
<b>But she didn't learn anything last time.</b>

06:41.490 --> 06:46.490
<b>That's because we didn't know 
Kurapika was the chain user.</b>

06:47.840 --> 06:50.750
<b>Then we just have to stay away from them.</b>

06:51.270 --> 06:54.040
<b>They've already checked you, 
so they think you're clean.</b>

06:54.400 --> 06:56.560
<b>But there's also a guy called Nobunaga.</b>

06:56.920 --> 06:58.540
<b>He's especially dangerous.</b>

06:58.540 --> 07:00.100
<b>He's looking for Kurapika,</b>

07:00.100 --> 07:02.470
<b>and he's still trying to chase us down.</b>

07:02.470 --> 07:06.570
<b>Is he aware that you guys know Kurapika?</b>

07:06.570 --> 07:07.190
<b>No...</b>

07:07.190 --> 07:09.090
<b>Then it's okay!</b>

07:09.090 --> 07:11.750
<b>As long as no one around the mind reader</b>

07:11.750 --> 07:14.740
<b>knows Kurapika, then you're safe.</b>

07:15.250 --> 07:18.330
<b>Well, I've also been in 
contact with Hisoka.</b>

07:18.330 --> 07:19.080
<b>What?!</b>

07:19.410 --> 07:20.710
<b>Hisoka?</b>

07:21.600 --> 07:25.090
<b>He knows that I am the chain user.</b>

07:25.830 --> 07:28.330
<b>We made a pact,</b>

07:28.330 --> 07:31.470
<b>but his target, the leader of 
the spiders, is now dead.</b>

07:31.850 --> 07:34.390
<b>So I don't know what he'll do.</b>

07:40.960 --> 07:42.540
<b>What do you mean?</b>

07:43.020 --> 07:44.610
<b>We're leaving?</b>

07:45.250 --> 07:46.810
<b>I mean exactly what I say.</b>

07:47.530 --> 07:48.860
<b>We're departing tonight.</b>

07:50.650 --> 07:53.110
<b>We'll take the rest of the treasure tonight.</b>

07:54.010 --> 07:55.370
<b>That will be the end.</b>

07:56.050 --> 07:57.240
<b>It isn't.</b>

07:57.990 --> 07:59.360
<b>What else is there?</b>

08:00.290 --> 08:02.100
<b>We have to find the chain user.</b>

08:02.750 --> 08:03.860
<b>You seem obsessed.</b>

08:03.860 --> 08:05.500
<b>Yes, I am.</b>

08:06.260 --> 08:10.510
<b>We're going to scatter 
without avenging Uvo?</b>

08:11.150 --> 08:13.730
<b>Uvo will be bored in the next 
world if we don't send</b>

08:13.730 --> 08:15.890
<b>the chain user to join him.</b>

08:16.330 --> 08:18.990
<b>Cut it out, Nobunaga.</b>

08:18.990 --> 08:20.530
<b>The boss has issued an order.</b>

08:20.880 --> 08:24.140
<b>Yeah, and an order from 
the boss is absolute.</b>

08:24.870 --> 08:29.250
<b>But is that really an order from our boss,</b>

08:29.250 --> 08:30.380
<b>Chrollo?</b>

08:31.050 --> 08:33.180
<b>Nobunaga, watch yourself...</b>

08:33.180 --> 08:34.220
<b>Shut up!</b>

08:34.220 --> 08:36.280
<b>I'm talking to Chrollo!</b>

08:42.070 --> 08:44.290
<b>Before I can answer your question...</b>

08:45.870 --> 08:47.040
<b>Nobunaga,</b>

08:48.290 --> 08:50.530
<b>I need you to answer my question.</b>

08:56.880 --> 08:58.140
<b>Nobunaga,</b>

08:58.520 --> 09:00.390
<b>I need you to answer my question.</b>

09:01.950 --> 09:03.020
<b>What's your date of birth?</b>

09:03.420 --> 09:04.450
<b>Huh?</b>

09:04.450 --> 09:07.020
<b>What day were you born?</b>

09:07.820 --> 09:09.770
<b>September 8th, 70.</b>

09:10.880 --> 09:12.530
<b>Blood type?</b>

09:12.530 --> 09:13.470
<b>B.</b>

09:14.120 --> 09:15.150
<b>Name?</b>

09:15.640 --> 09:16.990
<b>Nobunaga Hazama...</b>

09:16.990 --> 09:18.330
<b>You already know that!</b>

09:18.330 --> 09:19.510
<b>The hell is this about?!</b>

09:19.510 --> 09:21.290
<b>What do you want next?</b>

09:21.690 --> 09:23.640
<b>No, that's enough.</b>

09:24.250 --> 09:26.030
<b>Write all of that on this sheet of paper.</b>

09:26.710 --> 09:30.290
<b>Why didn't you tell me to 
do that in the first place?</b>

09:48.410 --> 09:50.290
<b>Huh? What's this?</b>

09:50.850 --> 09:54.760
<b>A one hundred percent accurate 
fortune written in verse.</b>

09:54.760 --> 09:56.160
<b>The ability to see the future.</b>

09:56.590 --> 09:58.950
<b>I stole this power from Nostrade's daughter.</b>

09:59.380 --> 10:01.950
<b>One hundred percent accurate?</b>

10:01.950 --> 10:06.710
<b>Each of the four verses predicts 
what will happen in that week.</b>

10:08.310 --> 10:11.090
<b><i>The calendar loses a precious component.</i></b>

10:11.090 --> 10:14.200
<b><i>The remaining months gather to mourn.</i></b>

10:14.690 --> 10:16.980
<b><i>The first moon, having missed his opportunity,</i></b>

10:16.980 --> 10:19.530
<b><i>continues to pursue the eleventh moon alone.</i></b>

10:20.340 --> 10:22.910
<b><i>The chrysanthemum withers and falls,</i></b>

10:22.910 --> 10:26.170
<b><i>to lie on the ground beside bloody Scarlet Eyes.</i></b>

10:26.170 --> 10:28.550
<b><i>But the spider does not stop.</i></b>

10:28.550 --> 10:31.440
<b><i>Even after losing half its limbs.</i></b>

10:34.050 --> 10:38.270
<b>This is the fortune his 
daughter gave me yesterday.</b>

10:40.140 --> 10:44.080
<b>Is the precious component of the calendar...</b>

10:45.630 --> 10:46.830
<b>Uvo.</b>

10:49.270 --> 10:52.360
<b>That girl didn't know anything about Uvo.</b>

10:52.800 --> 10:56.860
<b>In other words, she predicted our attack</b>

10:56.860 --> 10:58.990
<b>on the Mafia auction.</b>

10:59.700 --> 11:03.850
<b>And there were fans of her 
fortunetelling among the Ten Dons.</b>

11:04.170 --> 11:05.630
<b>I get it.</b>

11:05.630 --> 11:07.980
<b>That explains why the merchandise</b>

11:07.980 --> 11:11.630
<b>had already been moved the 
first time we attacked.</b>

11:12.290 --> 11:15.230
<b>What does Nobunaga's fortune say?</b>

11:15.770 --> 11:17.370
<b>The pen writes by itself.</b>

11:18.020 --> 11:20.080
<b>I don't know what was written.</b>

11:20.640 --> 11:21.860
<b>Ask Nobunaga.</b>

11:22.390 --> 11:24.310
<b>Well, Nobunaga?</b>

11:25.960 --> 11:29.500
<b>Next week, five of us will probably die.</b>

11:29.870 --> 11:32.230
<b>Which five?</b>

11:32.780 --> 11:34.260
<b>No idea...</b>

11:34.260 --> 11:36.130
<b>I can't interpret this.</b>

11:37.040 --> 11:39.770
<b>I kind of understand the second verse.</b>

11:39.770 --> 11:43.010
<b>The spider loses half its limbs.</b>

11:43.580 --> 11:45.480
<b>The spider would be us?</b>

11:45.940 --> 11:46.730
<b>Yeah.</b>

11:47.120 --> 11:49.130
<b>And the limbs would be the members,</b>

11:49.130 --> 11:51.020
<b>so half would be six.</b>

11:51.020 --> 11:54.150
<b>That means five more after losing Uvo.</b>

11:54.990 --> 11:57.600
<b>The same line was in my fortune.</b>

11:58.870 --> 12:00.150
<b>Let me see.</b>

12:02.260 --> 12:06.160
<b>Boss, can you tell my fortune?</b>

12:08.020 --> 12:10.820
<b><i>The calendar loses a precious component.</i></b>

12:10.820 --> 12:14.050
<b><i>The remaining months gather to mourn.</i></b>

12:14.960 --> 12:17.690
<b><i>You join your ally as an offering,</i></b>

12:18.310 --> 12:20.790
<b><i>to keep him from being lonely.</i></b>

12:21.930 --> 12:24.370
<b><i>You will find eternal rest</i></b>

12:24.370 --> 12:26.840
<b><i>in a room filled with black merchandise.</i></b>

12:27.450 --> 12:29.800
<b><i>Beware solitude above all.</i></b>

12:30.380 --> 12:32.850
<b><i>You have the most to fear when 
you are alone with another.</i></b>

12:33.930 --> 12:35.160
<b>I thought so.</b>

12:35.640 --> 12:37.550
<b>I'm going to die next week.</b>

12:38.140 --> 12:39.290
<b>Seriously?</b>

12:39.290 --> 12:40.140
<b>Yep.</b>

12:40.140 --> 12:43.210
<b>Because I only got two verses.</b>

12:43.880 --> 12:46.870
<b>And Pakunoda and Shalnark will die, as well.</b>

12:49.600 --> 12:52.240
<b>How do you know that?</b>

12:52.720 --> 12:56.880
<b>It seems the numbered months 
here refer to Troupe members.</b>

12:57.550 --> 12:59.340
<b>November is the eleventh month.</b>

12:59.760 --> 13:01.860
<b>Uvo was member #11.</b>

13:01.860 --> 13:03.070
<b>Exactly.</b>

13:03.700 --> 13:06.260
<b>The chrysanthemum is the 
flower of September.</b>

13:06.890 --> 13:09.010
<b>It blooms in August, the eighth month,</b>

13:09.480 --> 13:11.420
<b>and it withers in June.</b>

13:11.420 --> 13:14.890
<b>This refers to members #6, #8, and #9.</b>

13:15.670 --> 13:19.270
<b>And since the word "falling" 
is used, it implies death.</b>

13:20.220 --> 13:22.900
<b>I'm not certain to whom "Scarlet Eyes" refers.</b>

13:23.210 --> 13:24.480
<b>It isn't one of us.</b>

13:25.030 --> 13:27.780
<b>I'm guessing it's the chain user.</b>

13:29.420 --> 13:30.860
<b>Scarlet Eyes...</b>

13:30.860 --> 13:32.340
<b>I remember now.</b>

13:32.340 --> 13:34.460
<b>The clan whose eyes turned red.</b>

13:34.460 --> 13:36.800
<b>Then there was a survivor?</b>

13:37.420 --> 13:39.040
<b>So it seems...</b>

13:39.580 --> 13:41.550
<b>Will he also die?</b>

13:41.550 --> 13:43.070
<b>Hard to say.</b>

13:43.070 --> 13:45.670
<b>It could just mean that he's covered in blood.</b>

13:46.460 --> 13:50.420
<b>Nobunaga, this means we'll 
suffer serious casualties</b>

13:50.420 --> 13:52.380
<b>if we fight the chain user!</b>

13:52.380 --> 13:53.560
<b>We'll lose half our members.</b>

13:54.450 --> 13:58.020
<b>You and I have abilities that 
can be easily replaced,</b>

13:58.020 --> 14:00.060
<b>but Shizuku and Pakunoda have rare powers.</b>

14:00.800 --> 14:03.690
<b>The Troupe can't afford to lose them.</b>

14:07.320 --> 14:09.750
<b>Today is Saturday of the first week.</b>

14:10.410 --> 14:13.370
<b>If we return home today,</b>

14:13.370 --> 14:16.710
<b>we won't run into the chain user next week.</b>

14:17.760 --> 14:21.460
<b>The advantage of being able 
to predict the future</b>

14:22.040 --> 14:24.710
<b>is that we can avoid undesirable prophecies.</b>

14:26.100 --> 14:30.490
<b>If we leave this place without 
fighting the chain user,</b>

14:30.990 --> 14:33.940
<b>this fortune is one hundred percent 
certain to not come true.</b>

14:35.200 --> 14:39.030
<b>Nobunaga, you and Uvo were 
the Troupe's attackers.</b>

14:39.610 --> 14:41.970
<b>To die is just part of your job.</b>

14:42.900 --> 14:47.490
<b>I believe that you both chose 
that role voluntarily.</b>

14:48.810 --> 14:51.370
<b>Yeah, that's right...</b>

14:51.850 --> 14:56.130
<b>Shizuku, Paku, and Shal collect intelligence.</b>

14:56.910 --> 14:59.300
<b>They provide our support.</b>

14:59.300 --> 15:00.760
<b>You could say they're our lifeline.</b>

15:01.400 --> 15:06.000
<b>Isn't it your job to serve as their shield?</b>

15:06.000 --> 15:07.680
<b>Yeah, it is!</b>

15:08.200 --> 15:09.510
<b>Wait...</b>

15:11.780 --> 15:14.470
<b>You should tell some of the 
other members' fortunes.</b>

15:14.880 --> 15:20.460
<b>Perhaps we could gather additional 
clues for avoiding the prophecy.</b>

15:24.890 --> 15:25.730
<b>What do we do?</b>

15:26.500 --> 15:28.910
<b>Now that we know Kurapika's secret,</b>

15:28.910 --> 15:30.110
<b>it's dangerous to wait around.</b>

15:30.800 --> 15:33.250
<b>If Nobunaga captures either Gon or me again,</b>

15:33.250 --> 15:34.370
<b>we probably won't be able to escape.</b>

15:34.850 --> 15:37.350
<b>But we have Kurapika with us now.</b>

15:37.350 --> 15:38.980
<b>We should take them out</b>

15:38.980 --> 15:41.420
<b>before they have a chance 
to recover and escape.</b>

15:41.930 --> 15:44.050
<b>We know where their current base is.</b>

15:44.910 --> 15:47.650
<b>If we take too long, they might get away.</b>

15:48.120 --> 15:49.950
<b>We need to move fast.</b>

15:56.130 --> 15:59.640
<b>They could be making an 
escape as we speak.</b>

16:00.040 --> 16:02.060
<b>We don't have time for too much thought.</b>

16:03.430 --> 16:07.390
<b>The woman you mentioned 
is certainly a threat...</b>

16:07.980 --> 16:10.310
<b>But since their leader is dead,</b>

16:10.310 --> 16:15.410
<b>I'll do as Gon says, and focus on 
recovering my brethren's eyes.</b>

16:15.710 --> 16:16.790
<b>Seriously?!</b>

16:16.790 --> 16:17.740
<b>Yeah.</b>

16:17.740 --> 16:19.430
<b>You're sure about this?</b>

16:19.430 --> 16:22.000
<b>Kurapika's made up his mind.</b>

16:22.620 --> 16:26.010
<b>We can't force him to change it.</b>

16:27.510 --> 16:29.040
<b>Sorry, Killua.</b>

16:29.660 --> 16:33.260
<b>Thank you for the valuable information.</b>

16:37.110 --> 16:38.320
<b>It's from Hisoka...</b>

16:41.520 --> 16:43.620
<b>The dead bodies were fakes.</b>

16:49.140 --> 16:50.430
<b>Kurapika?</b>

16:51.300 --> 16:53.180
<b>The dead bodies were fakes...</b>

16:53.180 --> 16:53.970
<b>Huh?</b>

16:53.970 --> 16:55.820
<b>You mean the dead bodies 
of the Troupe members?</b>

16:55.820 --> 16:58.920
<b>Yeah, the dead spiders were fakes!</b>

16:59.400 --> 17:02.710
<b>It would be possible for a 
Conjurer to accomplish that.</b>

17:03.210 --> 17:04.250
<b>Damn!</b>

17:04.250 --> 17:06.880
<b>Why didn't I realize this sooner?</b>

17:07.260 --> 17:08.720
<b>The situation's changed.</b>

17:09.220 --> 17:09.840
<b>What now?</b>

17:10.660 --> 17:12.210
<b>We're here to help.</b>

17:12.560 --> 17:13.470
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

17:13.800 --> 17:14.720
<b>Yeah.</b>

17:18.730 --> 17:20.010
<b>Hello?</b>

17:20.010 --> 17:21.970
<b>Kurapika, it's me.</b>

17:22.280 --> 17:23.560
<b>Melody?</b>

17:23.560 --> 17:24.570
<b>What is it?</b>

17:24.570 --> 17:28.430
<b>The community has called off the hunt 
for the remaining Troupe members.</b>

17:28.430 --> 17:29.460
<b>What?</b>

17:29.460 --> 17:32.850
<b>We've learned that they 
came from Meteor City.</b>

17:33.510 --> 17:35.860
<b>The Troupe comes from Meteor City?</b>

17:36.220 --> 17:40.020
<b>The Ten Dons gave the order directly.</b>

17:40.720 --> 17:43.620
<b>The reward has been rescinded.</b>

17:47.700 --> 17:49.630
<b>The reward has been rescinded?</b>

17:50.170 --> 17:51.240
<b>Seriously?</b>

17:53.170 --> 17:55.910
<b>The Troupe comes from Meteor City.</b>

17:56.640 --> 17:58.140
<b>Makes sense...</b>

17:58.140 --> 18:00.540
<b>That explains why their 
identities are still unknown,</b>

18:00.540 --> 18:04.390
<b>and why the cops haven't 
been able to catch them.</b>

18:04.670 --> 18:06.290
<b>What's Meteor City?</b>

18:06.790 --> 18:11.370
<b>A city populated by people who, 
as far as society is concerned, don't exist.</b>

18:11.370 --> 18:13.150
<b>There's a city like that?</b>

18:13.480 --> 18:14.420
<b>Yeah.</b>

18:14.420 --> 18:17.350
<b>Officially, it's unpopulated,</b>

18:17.350 --> 18:20.910
<b>but it's said that ten million people live there.</b>

18:23.160 --> 18:27.560
<b>It began as a dump over 1,500 years ago.</b>

18:28.070 --> 18:30.840
<b>People began to live off the garbage</b>

18:30.840 --> 18:33.050
<b>that was dumped there.</b>

18:33.660 --> 18:36.030
<b>You're allowed to dump anything there.</b>

18:36.620 --> 18:39.480
<b>From garbage to weapons, and even people.</b>

18:40.230 --> 18:42.140
<b>And the residents</b>

18:42.140 --> 18:45.250
<b>will accept anything left there.</b>

18:47.100 --> 18:51.370
<b>I've heard that Meteor City 
residents share a bond</b>

18:51.370 --> 18:54.770
<b>thinner than that between strangers, 
stronger than that between family.</b>

18:55.910 --> 18:59.520
<b>Actually, there are those 
who provide Meteor City</b>

18:59.520 --> 19:03.010
<b>with weapons and precious metals 
under the pretext of garbage.</b>

19:03.310 --> 19:05.290
<b>That would be the Mafia community.</b>

19:06.630 --> 19:07.770
<b>What do you mean?</b>

19:07.770 --> 19:09.910
<b>But the Mafia is hunting the Troupe!</b>

19:09.910 --> 19:14.680
<b>In return, the Mafia recruited 
people from Meteor City.</b>

19:14.680 --> 19:17.710
<b>People who didn't exist, as far 
as society was concerned.</b>

19:18.180 --> 19:19.680
<b>Perfect for committing crimes.</b>

19:20.330 --> 19:22.870
<b>The Troupe destroyed the 
normally intimate relationship</b>

19:22.870 --> 19:25.930
<b>between the Mafia community and Meteor City.</b>

19:26.460 --> 19:31.520
<b>But the Mafia has decided to 
prioritize that relationship.</b>

19:46.370 --> 19:49.830
<b><i>A red-eyed customer will visit your shop,</i></b>

<b>I don't recommend it.</b>

20:31.160 --> 20:32.710
<b>It'll give you a shock.</b>

20:33.220 --> 20:34.580
<b>Just let me see it.</b>

<b>Very well.</b>
