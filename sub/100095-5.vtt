In Reddington's world, Devane
is known as a killer for hire.

is injected

backdoor access

11:20.610 --> 11:22.749

was a little sticky.

testing for hospitals

12:21.240 --> 12:22.639

all across the country,

31:46.930 --> 31:48.329
The drone strike.

31:48.370 --> 31:51.168
After the strike, you went
from hundreds of victims

31:51.210 --> 31:52.507
to... Ten?

31:52.540 --> 31:54.679
Why? What changed?

31:56.380 --> 31:58.371
I have all day.

31:58.410 --> 32:02.039
You? What?
An hour, maybe less?

32:02.080 --> 32:04.287
The drone strike.

32:05.290 --> 32:08.350
In the hospital after,
I got an infection.

32:09.390 --> 32:12.928
Drug-resistant.
Nearly killed me.

32:12.960 --> 32:16.589
Everything I did to make
other people vulnerable...

32:16.630 --> 32:18.996
I never thought
how vulnerable I was.

32:19.030 --> 32:22.033
So that's what all
of this is about?
Protecting yourself?

32:22.070 --> 32:24.265
Finding cures to diseases
you might get?

32:24.310 --> 32:26.835
It seems the germ doctor
is a germophobe.

32:26.870 --> 32:30.374
A word to the wise and dying.
You can't cheat death.

32:30.410 --> 32:33.106
You can't predict it or
protect yourself against it.

32:33.150 --> 32:34.447
I can.

32:35.580 --> 32:38.686
By testing
immunotherapy drugs,

32:38.720 --> 32:41.757
I learned to harness
the body's immune response

32:41.790 --> 32:45.351
to fight untreatable
bacteria, cancers.

32:45.390 --> 32:48.427
You learned to do it by
experimenting on people.

32:48.460 --> 32:50.098
(SCOFFS)
And you didn't?

32:50.130 --> 32:52.792
I gave
terminally ill hope.

32:52.830 --> 32:54.434
I didn't
infect children.

back to the boy.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.777
The hack at the NDL.

33:03.810 --> 33:08.110

and you find a handful

33:08.150 --> 33:10.038

in common with you

33:10.080 --> 33:12.981
to guarantee that if the cures
worked for them,

33:14.860 --> 33:15.952
Did it work?

33:17.320 --> 33:18.457
Please tell me.

33:18.490 --> 33:21.789
As soon as you tell me
about a Russian operative

33:21.830 --> 33:25.960
you did contract work
for in 1986.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.968
She reached out to you
recently.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.831
I want to know why.

33:29.870 --> 33:32.930
The cure...
If it worked...

33:32.970 --> 33:35.177
Tell me about
the Russian.

Not for her.

You do.

34:05.570 --> 34:07.868

Who are you calling?

34:07.910 --> 34:10.128
Keen. She's at the hospital
with the boy.

34:10.180 --> 34:12.000
She'll know by now
if the cure worked.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.473
That won't be necessary.
And Why not?

34:14.520 --> 34:16.670
Because I have the cure
right here.

why Howie was admitted?

34:28.760 --> 34:30.728
To be a lab rat?

34:30.760 --> 34:32.864
Devane cured
the headmaster's son.

34:32.900 --> 34:34.333
He had a terminal illness,

34:34.370 --> 34:36.338
and somehow_De_vane
put it in remissmn.

34:36.370 --> 34:37.530
So he let some maniac

34:37.570 --> 34:39.401
infect my son with some
biological disease?

34:39.440 --> 34:41.738
Devane agreed to
continue treatment on
the headmaster's son

34:41.780 --> 34:43.236
if he agreed to allow him

34:43.280 --> 34:45.874
to experiment
on the students
at the school.

34:45.910 --> 34:47.241
To make him sick.

34:47.280 --> 34:48.679
To test his treatments.

34:50.480 --> 34:53.381
He gave Howard immunotherapy
that he designed for himself.

34:54.120 --> 34:56.384
I assume he did that
for every boy.

34:56.420 --> 34:57.648
Were they all cured?

34:57.690 --> 34:59.829
No. They weren't.

Mr. Keller?

35:01.600 --> 35:03.921

we've run on your son.

35:03.960 --> 35:05.097
And?

35:05.130 --> 35:07.462
And the results
are very unusual.

35:10.040 --> 35:12.429
I apologize, Spalding.

35:12.470 --> 35:14.028
You offered your services,

35:14.070 --> 35:16.868
and I returned the favor
by acting intemperately.

It can't be compromised.

what you did.

35:27.190 --> 35:29.055
Reddington killed Devane.

35:29.090 --> 35:30.580
For refusing
to cooperate?

35:30.620 --> 35:32.554
No, Devane told him
what he wanted to hear.

35:32.590 --> 35:34.421
Reddington
shot him anyway.
