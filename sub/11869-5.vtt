00:01.084 --> 00:02.824
CARTER: It wasjust
a normal day in Eureka.

00:02.961 --> 00:03.996
Day's not over yet.

00:04.129 --> 00:05.960
Yeah. Like that was
going to last.

00:06.381 --> 00:09.248
Hello, 1947.
Confused? Let me clarify.

00:09.593 --> 00:11.458
The five of us got
transported back in time

00:11.595 --> 00:13.711
through some wormhole thingy
thanks to the Bridge Device.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.087
We eventually found
our way back home,

00:15.224 --> 00:17.761
but, surprise, home wasn't
exactly the way we left it.

00:17.893 --> 00:19.849
Henry? Married.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.684
Zane and Jo? Never dated.

00:21.897 --> 00:23.182
But Jo's in charge
of G.D. Security.

00:23.482 --> 00:25.848
Kevin? Different,
much to Allison's surprise.

00:25.984 --> 00:27.849
And Fargo?
Head of Global Dynamics,

00:27.986 --> 00:29.567
much to everyone's surprise.

00:29.696 --> 00:32.153
Oh, and Dr. Old Spice
hitched a ride with us
back to the present,

00:32.282 --> 00:34.147
but there's one crappy rule.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.616
We can't tell anyone.

00:36.745 --> 00:39.202
If people ever found out
about our trip,
there'd be trouble.

00:39.623 --> 00:43.115
And I finally kissed Allison,
63 years ago.

00:43.460 --> 00:46.372
But, of course,
Dr. Charles Grant
had to get in the way.

00:46.505 --> 00:49.838
I promise you we will get
you back where you belong.
Lickety—split.

00:49.967 --> 00:52.128
Until then, Dr. Blake,
would you care for
some cotton candy?

00:52.344 --> 00:54.084
Allie. No, no, no...

00:54.972 --> 00:56.337
Oh, and let's not
forget.

00:56.473 --> 00:57.462
GRANT: The Bridge Device?

00:57.891 --> 00:59.427
We cannot rebuild
the bridge back
to your time,

00:59.601 --> 01:02.638
and even if we could,
it would be potentially
catastrophic.

01:02.854 --> 01:04.230
Yeah. That's never good.

01:04.690 --> 01:07.807
But that's Eureka for you.
Same town, big changes.

01:08.652 --> 01:10.938
And what's
surprising is that
she hogs the TV.

01:11.071 --> 01:14.234
Lupo can watch
three reality shows
simultaneously.

01:14.366 --> 01:17.699
Last night she had SARAH
voting for the guy with the
eye patch all night long.

01:17.828 --> 01:19.864
Ooh...
Eye patches are sexy.
Missing the point.

01:19.997 --> 01:22.830
So are you.
I think you like
the company.

01:22.958 --> 01:26.121
No, I don't...
Maybe...
Don't tell Jo.

01:26.295 --> 01:28.286
(LAUGHS)
Your secret's
safe with me.

01:29.881 --> 01:30.870
Thank you.

01:31.133 --> 01:35.172
So, did I tell you that
Jenna is stacking blocks?
No!

01:35.429 --> 01:39.388
Look, I know that gross motor
development outpaces
fine motor at this age,

01:39.516 --> 01:42.633
but I'm pretty sure
that she's gifted.
Clearly.

01:42.978 --> 01:46.846
Decaf for you, and a double
espresso for Charles.
Tell him I said hi.

01:46.982 --> 01:49.189
Thank you.

01:49.318 --> 01:52.355
Coffee for him?
For Dr. Nice Gams?

01:52.738 --> 01:55.525
Stop it. He's quitting
smoking. I thought this
would take the edge off.

01:55.657 --> 01:59.195
Hmm.
And | get to test G.D.'s
latest nicotine therapy.

01:59.494 --> 02:03.453
Oh, does that involve
immense pain
and suffering 'cause...

02:03.832 --> 02:07.450
Would you be nice?
He's not so bad once
you get to know him.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.331
Ah...
And I do have
nice gams.

02:11.214 --> 02:13.796
Oh, like I don't
know that.

02:13.925 --> 02:17.383
You... You do.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.224
Hey, Jack.
What's wrong?

02:25.979 --> 02:29.517
Umm...
I kissed Allison.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.556
What?
VVhen?

02:31.693 --> 02:33.854
Sixty years ago
before we came back,
and itjust...

02:33.987 --> 02:39.198
And now Old Spice is here
with his stupid hats and his
"Oh, smoking's so cool."

02:39.201 --> 02:40.782
And now Old Spice is here
with his stupid hats and his
"Oh, smoking's so cool."

02:40.911 --> 02:44.403
And it's just
gotten a bit...
Complicated.

02:45.457 --> 02:46.446
So, how's Grace?

02:46.625 --> 02:51.369
She's coming back from the
conference today. I just wish
I could tell her the truth.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.161
Yeah. I know.
But we can't.
I know.

02:53.298 --> 02:54.583
Protocols.
I know.

02:55.008 --> 02:59.843
I mean, but she then gets
stuck holding on to a past
with me that no longer exists.

02:59.971 --> 03:04.681
Meanwhile, I'm beginning
to feel like there's
no future without her.

03:04.935 --> 03:07.267
Hey, what are you doing?
Where are you going?

03:07.396 --> 03:09.762
Just doing a little
thing called myjob.

03:09.898 --> 03:13.311
Okay, well, she's near,
so, got to look our best.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.900
(EXCLAIMS)
Never do that!

03:16.029 --> 03:18.236
Sorry, just want
everything to be
perfect for our VIP.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.356
VIP?
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)

03:20.575 --> 03:22.827

wagon should have
been set up by now.

03:22.953 --> 03:25.365
All right,
listen I got to...
Thanks. Yeah.

03:41.179 --> 03:42.965
(WHISPERING)
Here.

03:43.181 --> 03:47.174
Breakfast croissants and
muffins to go, Fargo.
Savory and sweet.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.846
Ah, just like
our VIP.

03:48.979 --> 03:51.846
Fargo, this isn't
The Bachelor,
you know.

03:51.982 --> 03:52.937
Yeah,
says you.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.773
Muffins, sweet...
Oh, cut me some slack.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.439
(CAR HORN HONKS)
FARGO: She's here?

04:09.624 --> 04:11.330
What's up,
bHches?

04:27.559 --> 04:29.515
Claudia Donovan, she's from
Warehouse 13. So...

04:29.644 --> 04:31.509
This isn't going to end well.

04:32.731 --> 04:33.686
Oh, wow,
snacks.

04:33.815 --> 04:36.147
It's just how we greet
everybody. Come on.
Meet the troops.

04:37.652 --> 04:39.608
On the end is...
Jo, right?

04:39.738 --> 04:41.945
Yeah, Doug said
you were a major babe
who kicks major ass.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.522
Did he?

04:44.743 --> 04:45.732
Donovan?

04:46.536 --> 04:47.525
Donovan.
Coincidence?

04:47.788 --> 04:48.823
There's no
such thing,
sweetheart.

04:50.248 --> 04:52.284
Ah, Jo, can you
escort Zane back
to his hole?

04:52.667 --> 04:54.043
Oh, whatever.

04:54.169 --> 04:56.706
And you must
be the infamous
Sheriff Carter.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.248
How'd
you know?

04:58.381 --> 05:00.963
Something sheriff—y
aboutyou.
Yeah.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.048
So, director Doug,
where's my goo?

05:03.178 --> 05:05.885
Oh, I upgraded the
warehouse computers to
class seven standards

05:06.014 --> 05:08.096
and I figured I could
enhance the goo, too.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.974
Just so you know,
that doesn't sound right.

05:11.144 --> 05:16.138
No, no, no. It's neutralizing
insulation to protect the
artifacts during transport.

05:16.608 --> 05:19.315
l whipped up a
sample batch using
alkalizing agents.

05:20.153 --> 05:23.361
That's very nice of you.
Nice to meet you and welcome.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.605
Yeah, we really can't
wait to try it out.

05:25.951 --> 05:28.283
And thank you for the
welcome wagon. Jeez.

05:28.620 --> 05:29.655
I've got our
whole day planned.

05:29.788 --> 05:32.120
First off, a tour of Global
Dynamics while they
pack up your truck

05:32.249 --> 05:35.491
and I got Larry to cut
together an lMAX film
on the history of G.D.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.494
Sweet. Got any
flying cars?

05:39.589 --> 05:41.045

asthma just don't mix.

have asthma.

I do.

It's okay.

Yeah. This is the last one.
The core is almost ready.

that's the last transistor
from '47.

with musical

I'm really digging
the '70s.

(CHUCKLES)
Who'd have
thunk it?

Well, I'm full
of surprises.
Apparently.

06:29.389 --> 06:34.929
All right.
Are we ready for
an engine test?

06:35.395 --> 06:36.851
Yeah.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.386
Excited?

A little nervous.
I know I can't use the
bridge to go back,

06:42.235 --> 06:46.604
but there's something poetic
about using a relic from the
past to explore the future.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.571
Now, understanding
the nature of wormholes

06:48.700 --> 06:50.611
is going to lead to
new forms of space travel.

a first step.

to innovation.

out for you.

to Eureka.

to the building.

Well, not exactly.
I mean, if you
look at the damage,

11:04.914 --> 11:07.747
you'll see that they
actually displaced
the floor and the ceiling.

I've never seen
anything like it.

11:09.377 --> 11:12.790

like I know what I'm doing.
Was that too much to ask for?

11:12.922 --> 11:13.911
Evidently.

right through it.

seeing this?

know, memories.

If you guys want, I mean,
I could stick around,
help analyze the results.

11:40.158 --> 11:44.026
I love that idea. I mean,
that would be
really helpful, right?

11:44.162 --> 11:46.995
Well, as a matter of fact,
I was going to suggest the
same thing. So, shall we?

12:12.232 --> 12:14.143
It injects a steady
stream of nanobots.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.687
They'll purge the
nicotine from
your bloodstream.

12:16.819 --> 12:21.688

carry on smoking and
they'll scrub me clean.

No. No, you
left that part out.

make it up to me.

trading one vice
for another.

an endless supply of vices
for you to cure, Dr. Blake.

If you can call being
uprooted from your

13:06.911 --> 13:09.778
Well, maybe we should
give them some
nitrogen and potassium

13:09.914 --> 13:12.405
to ease the shock
of the transplant.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.912

about the trees.

Learned a ton about

Specifically,
ring patterns.

would have known?

Tree rings? It's third grade.
I do know things, you know?

Like how when there's
a fire or a drought,
trees don't grow as fast.

13:51.414 --> 13:54.326
Right. So, check this out.
The Mount St. Helens
eruption, 1980,

13:54.459 --> 13:57.667
covered this whole region
in ash. That should have
produced a black ring.

13:57.795 --> 14:01.504
Hmm. But it's not there.
And none of the
trees inside have it.

14:01.883 --> 14:03.214
So, I'm thinking
we compare these scans

14:03.343 --> 14:04.924
with the trees outside,
see what that tells us.

with you.

a lot on his mind.

working at the warehouse?

Not too shabby.
It's only crashed twice.

made my life way easier,

So, how's Todd?

22:51.954 --> 22:53.740
I wouldn't know.
We broke up.

That's unfortunate.

Yeah, too smart.

23:07.887 --> 23:08.922
This stuff's coming
through from 1947.

23:09.054 --> 23:11.887
Yeah, well, my scanner
picked up an unusual surge
of exotic particles.

23:12.349 --> 23:13.634
Exotic sounds bad.

23:13.767 --> 23:15.473
Well, they traveled
faster than
the speed of light.

23:15.603 --> 23:17.389
As in breaking
the time barrier.

23:17.688 --> 23:18.723
Wait, I thought
the Einstein Bridge
was DOA.

23:18.856 --> 23:21.268
It is.
But Charles and I
reconstructed the core

23:21.400 --> 23:23.356
to see if it would work
for other applications.

23:23.861 --> 23:25.397
What? Did you need a new
toaster? Why'd you do that?

23:25.571 --> 23:28.187
Not for time travel,
but to research wormholes,

23:28.324 --> 23:29.734
and we only activated it
for a couple seconds.

23:29.867 --> 23:31.277
Barely got a spark
out of the core.

23:31.410 --> 23:34.743
Okay. Okay.
Could the wormhole have
been reopened by it?

23:36.040 --> 23:38.656
If it was unstable.
Maybe it's possible.

23:40.878 --> 23:41.913
And what if we can't stop it?

23:43.881 --> 23:46.088

into each other,

as we know it cease to exist.

you experiment with something
less potentially world—ending?

a quantum chromodynamic

words together.

if certain exotic particles
were separated

24:34.098 --> 24:35.679
and then pulled
through a wormhole,

24:35.808 --> 24:37.719
they would still have
a massive attraction
to each other.

disturbance it might
set off all the mines.

33:52.906 --> 33:55.318
I guess up until now,
Eureka was pretty cool.

33:57.244 --> 34:00.828
Well, if! have to go
I guess this isn't so bad.

34:01.998 --> 34:03.829
At least they'll say
we went out with a bang.

34:07.796 --> 34:08.831
CARTER: Fargo?

34:09.965 --> 34:12.001
Oh, great timing, Sheriff.

34:12.342 --> 34:13.548
Don't move!

34:13.843 --> 34:14.798
BOTH: Too late.

34:15.345 --> 34:17.461
Doug kind of put
his head on a mine.

34:17.597 --> 34:19.804
After I saved her
from standing on one.

34:20.475 --> 34:21.464
Don't move.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.316
Hey, Sheriff, be careful.

34:35.532 --> 34:36.692
Thanks.

34:43.415 --> 34:44.871
Whoa! (GRUNTS)

34:49.713 --> 34:50.793
You kids having fun?

34:51.047 --> 34:52.253
The most.

34:55.885 --> 34:57.216
How're you liking
that field work?

34:57.345 --> 34:58.380
CLAUDIA: What's it look like?

35:00.432 --> 35:01.512
Looks hard.

35:01.891 --> 35:02.880
(CLEARS THROAT)

35:07.397 --> 35:08.386
Okay.

35:13.069 --> 35:14.104
Pay attention.

35:14.571 --> 35:18.564
This is an
infrasonic diffuser.

35:20.827 --> 35:23.034
That or a plasma detonator.
Pretty sure I got
the right one.

35:23.163 --> 35:24.152
Pretty sure?

35:25.123 --> 35:27.079
I read the instructions.
Twice.

35:28.418 --> 35:32.457
I need to put this
on the mine
where your head is.

35:32.672 --> 35:34.663
But my head is
where my head is.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.634
This will help
keep it that way.

35:36.801 --> 35:38.587
That is so not comforting.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.085
On my mark,
roll to your right.

35:40.472 --> 35:41.507
His right or my right?

35:42.182 --> 35:43.171
His.

35:44.351 --> 35:45.431
(SOFTLY) Ready.

35:52.317 --> 35:55.354
One, two...

35:55.820 --> 35:56.809
Three!

36:06.831 --> 36:08.492
How do you like Eureka now?

36:08.708 --> 36:09.743
(CHUCKLES)

36:14.798 --> 36:15.787
You're welcome.

36:23.848 --> 36:25.304
I've rewritten the code
for the nanobots.

36:25.433 --> 36:27.094
But will they remove the
exotic particles without

36:27.227 --> 36:28.683
causing any
subatomic toxicity?

36:28.812 --> 36:30.222
Well, that's the
hypothesis, yes.

36:30.355 --> 36:31.515
Well, that's not
good enough.

36:31.648 --> 36:33.263
We don't have
time to play it safe.

36:36.778 --> 36:37.767
Here we go.

36:38.446 --> 36:39.481
(WHIMPERING)

36:39.614 --> 36:41.821
HENRY: The nanobots
are locking onto
the exotic particles.

36:44.828 --> 36:45.863
(STRAINING)

36:47.163 --> 36:49.074
HENRY: Vital organs are
approaching critical failure

36:49.207 --> 36:50.708
and the wormhole
is about to collapse.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.657
ALLISON: His system
can't take much more.

36:52.794 --> 36:54.034
We have to stop.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.452
Don't you dare!

37:04.723 --> 37:05.758
It's working.

37:26.286 --> 37:27.275
That's wild.

37:39.799 --> 37:42.461
GRANT: So, I guess
I picked the right day
to quit smoking after all.

37:43.136 --> 37:45.172
We saved the world
in time for drinks.

37:47.807 --> 37:49.138
You never give up, do you?

37:49.267 --> 37:50.598
No, I don't.

38:05.617 --> 38:06.652
Hey.

38:06.785 --> 38:07.774
Hey.

38:13.917 --> 38:14.952
What you doing?

38:16.252 --> 38:17.992
Changing the belt.

38:18.797 --> 38:19.786
(GRUNTING)

38:21.007 --> 38:22.463
I'll give you a hand
if you like.

38:22.592 --> 38:23.957
No, I got it.

38:24.093 --> 38:25.082
(STRAINING)

38:26.679 --> 38:28.260
All right, here,
here, here.
Come on, come on.

38:30.350 --> 38:31.840
(SOFTLY) There we go.

38:36.231 --> 38:37.721
I'm sorry I hurt you.

38:39.442 --> 38:41.307
Whatever it is,

38:42.612 --> 38:44.318
whatever you're going through,

38:45.782 --> 38:47.773
I can't help you
if you won't let me in.

38:51.454 --> 38:52.785
But I'll be here
when you're ready.

38:55.291 --> 38:56.371
Hand me the wrench.

39:04.801 --> 39:06.587
All right,
that should do it.

39:08.137 --> 39:09.593
I think you should
take it for a ride.

39:09.973 --> 39:13.966
I will, but there's something
I'd rather do first.

39:15.728 --> 39:17.309
Come on. Come on.

39:38.835 --> 39:42.168
No. I said go home
and rest.

39:42.797 --> 39:44.333
No heavy lifting,
I promise.

39:44.465 --> 39:48.299
I'm just... Just dotting
the l's, crossing the T's.

39:48.469 --> 39:49.800
Making this transfer official.

39:50.638 --> 39:52.799
Are you sure that sending
the bridge away was
the right decision?

39:53.141 --> 39:54.256
Definitely.

39:57.812 --> 39:58.801
Hmm.

39:59.689 --> 40:00.769
What's this?

40:03.026 --> 40:04.937
That's a souvenir for
old time's sake.

40:09.741 --> 40:10.776
You must miss home.

40:11.951 --> 40:13.782
I'll always have
memories of those people.

40:15.747 --> 40:16.953
This is my home now.

40:17.457 --> 40:19.493
It's not a bad place
to settle down.

40:19.918 --> 40:22.705
You know,
it's growing on me.

40:25.006 --> 40:28.544
Listen, Doctor, you...

40:31.763 --> 40:33.594
You saved my life.

40:33.890 --> 40:35.881
That's not a debt
a man can easily repay.

40:37.602 --> 40:38.808
At least let me
buy you a drink.

40:39.646 --> 40:40.931
(LAUGHS)

40:42.065 --> 40:43.771
Vincent makes
a spectacular sidecar.

40:44.525 --> 40:45.514
One drink.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.608
One? What, are we
going to share?

40:48.529 --> 40:50.315
Fine. Say I pick you up
at about 8:00.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.647
I'll meet you at 8:00.

41:00.750 --> 41:02.832
MAN ON TV: Welcome back
from the break,
ladies and gentlemen.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.997
How about a big hand for
all our contestants?

41:05.129 --> 41:06.380
Let's get them all
out here right now.

41:06.506 --> 41:07.495
Cerveza?

41:09.425 --> 41:10.801
Gracias.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.126
You okay?

41:14.889 --> 41:17.801
Yeah. Allison's having drinks
with Grant, so I'm a little...

41:18.601 --> 41:20.887
Oh, he's charming
and suave.

41:21.187 --> 41:22.768
Oh, and he's got
great hair.

41:22.897 --> 41:25.229
Thanks for making
me feel better.
That's awesome.

41:26.818 --> 41:28.274
But he isn't you.

41:30.780 --> 41:34.364
You know, there's
something about that
guy I just don't like.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.778
I don't trust him.

41:37.620 --> 41:40.236
Well, then get off your ass
and do something about it.

41:41.791 --> 41:42.871
Noted.

41:43.501 --> 41:44.616
How about you and Zane?

41:48.214 --> 41:51.206
I catch these glimpses
of who he used to be

41:53.219 --> 41:54.800
and then they're gone.

41:58.016 --> 41:59.631
Are we having girl talk?

42:00.643 --> 42:02.725
No, we're having guy talk.

42:02.979 --> 42:03.968
(LAUGHS)

42:04.230 --> 42:05.436
Semi—finals are on.

42:05.565 --> 42:08.022
Eye patch guy
made it to the next round.
You want to watch?

42:08.317 --> 42:09.818
See, I think he's pitchy.

42:12.780 --> 42:13.769
It's good to
have you here.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.651
Oh. You shouldn't have.

42:19.787 --> 42:21.448
No, trust me,
I should have.

42:21.831 --> 42:22.866
But there's more.

42:22.999 --> 42:25.991
I figured it was time
to mothball the
Einstein Bridge for good,

42:26.127 --> 42:28.334
and l was hoping,
maybe, you could
take it off our hands.

42:28.463 --> 42:30.704
Uh, we store artifacts.

42:30.840 --> 42:32.626
I mean, this thing
doesn't even
work anymore.

42:32.759 --> 42:34.374
Well, that could be
our little secret.

42:34.510 --> 42:36.842
And plus, you could
tell Artie you bagged
your first solo grab.

42:37.555 --> 42:38.635
I like the way
you think.

42:38.765 --> 42:41.006
Plus, ifthings
don't work out
at the warehouse,

42:41.142 --> 42:43.599
we could always
use someone
with your skills here.

42:43.978 --> 42:45.764
I do have
some pull
with the boss.

42:47.774 --> 42:48.638
Thanks, Doug.

42:48.775 --> 42:53.769
But I'm pretty attached
to the crew I have, so...

42:54.781 --> 42:55.770
So.

42:56.199 --> 42:57.188
(SIGHS)

43:02.538 --> 43:03.914
See you around,
Fargonator.
