WEBVTT

00:19.436 --> 00:22.939
This is unbelievable.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.399
Mmm.

00:24.482 --> 00:27.694
You know, as chaotic as this trip's been,

00:27.777 --> 00:31.031
I'm really going to miss this
when we go back to Chicago.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.283
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.909
Mmm?

00:35.535 --> 00:36.911
I'm not going back.

00:37.620 --> 00:38.455
What?

00:39.039 --> 00:40.498
[chuckles] Of course you are.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.584
Your life is in Chicago.

00:42.667 --> 00:44.419
Your friends, your job.

00:45.003 --> 00:48.214
Actually, I accepted a position
with a French company.

00:48.298 --> 00:49.674
What?

00:51.009 --> 00:52.927
Emily, you don't even speak French.

00:53.011 --> 00:54.345
I mean, no offense,

00:54.429 --> 00:57.015
but who would be stupid enough
to hire you in Paris?

01:00.268 --> 01:01.436
<i>Bonsoir,</i> Madeline.

01:03.229 --> 01:04.939
You've got to be kidding me.

01:05.023 --> 01:06.274
[in French] No, no, it's true.

01:06.357 --> 01:08.193
No, it's not true.

01:08.276 --> 01:09.235
Emily?

01:09.569 --> 01:11.571
-Um…
-[in English] Tell her, Emily.

01:12.822 --> 01:13.907
Emily.

01:14.616 --> 01:15.492
Think about this.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.203
Think for yourself.

01:18.787 --> 01:21.539
Do you want to give up
everything you've worked for?

01:21.623 --> 01:23.666
This is your life Emily, not hers.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.210
You can't trust her, Emily.

01:25.293 --> 01:26.586
You have to choose.

01:26.669 --> 01:27.545
[Emily] I…

01:29.005 --> 01:30.507
Emily!

01:31.591 --> 01:33.134
Wake up!

01:33.218 --> 01:35.345
[panting]

01:43.812 --> 01:44.687
Madeline…

01:48.608 --> 01:53.530
Madeline, this is the hardest decision
I have ever had to make.

01:56.533 --> 02:00.787
You've done so much for me
and I'm so grateful for that.

02:03.498 --> 02:05.250
[exhales]

02:05.333 --> 02:08.211
I mean, it's just something
that I have to do.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.088
[sighs]

02:10.839 --> 02:11.881
It's Paris!

02:17.137 --> 02:18.555
Emily, no!

02:18.638 --> 02:20.140
[exhales]

02:24.227 --> 02:25.937
I feel sick.

02:26.020 --> 02:28.481
She's been my mentor for years. I just…

02:28.565 --> 02:29.983
I hate disappointing people.

02:30.066 --> 02:33.236
I've been disappointing my parents
for decades. You get used to it.

02:33.361 --> 02:36.197
Uh-oh. New neighbor incoming. Be cool.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.157
Hey.

02:37.740 --> 02:41.244
-Oh. <i>Bonjour,</i> neighbor. <i>Ça va?</i>
<i>-Bonjour,</i> neighbor.

02:41.327 --> 02:42.370
[in French] Yes, great.

02:42.453 --> 02:44.831
[in English] Just getting
some croissants for Gabriel.

02:44.914 --> 02:48.251
You just moved in,
and you're his boulangerie bitch.

02:48.334 --> 02:49.169
Mindy.

02:49.252 --> 02:52.297
No, I don't mind.
He's always very eager to thank me.

02:53.089 --> 02:55.049
-That's great.
-Nice.

02:55.133 --> 02:57.343
By the way, my mom got a call from Sylvie

02:57.427 --> 03:00.180
asking us to bring the Champère account
to her new firm.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.182
What's going on?

03:02.265 --> 03:06.603
I'm so sorry about that.
I'm going to be clearing it all up today.

03:06.686 --> 03:10.273
Okay. No problemo.
Where you go, Champère will follow.

03:10.356 --> 03:11.733
I'm loyal to you, Emily.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.234
-[hesitantly] Thank you.
-Aw.

03:13.776 --> 03:16.070
And I love the new haircut. So chic.

03:16.237 --> 03:19.532
-[chuckles softly]
-Okay, guys. Have a nice day.

03:20.366 --> 03:21.451
-Bye.
-Bye.

03:22.410 --> 03:23.286
Okay, new plan.

03:23.369 --> 03:26.122
Make a pact with Camille
not to tell Madeline you're quitting

03:26.206 --> 03:27.373
and you'll be out of a job.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.542
We are not talking about that pact again!

03:29.626 --> 03:31.628
Come on, I'm joking, Em.

03:31.711 --> 03:34.839
-My focus is on Alfie.
-Mmm.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.591
Even though he's going to London,

03:36.674 --> 03:38.718
we're trying to figure out
how to make it work.

03:38.801 --> 03:39.969
What's to figure out?

03:40.053 --> 03:42.388
Make sure you're up to date
on your Eurail pass

03:42.472 --> 03:43.640
and your birth control.

03:44.682 --> 03:45.683
You are on birth control?

03:45.767 --> 03:46.809
-Yes.
-Okay.

03:51.564 --> 03:53.066
[exhales]

03:53.149 --> 03:56.152
[takes deep breath]

03:57.278 --> 03:58.738
Hmm.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.990
-Oh!
-Emily, there you are.

04:01.574 --> 04:04.786
I found Fritos in France.
Don't ask. Definitely black market.

04:04.869 --> 04:05.745
Um, you're a genius.

04:06.287 --> 04:07.830
Um… No, can we talk?

04:08.414 --> 04:10.917
Keep it quick, we've got a meeting
in the conference room.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.460
-We do?
-We do. Come on.

04:12.543 --> 04:15.255
Shore up the client base,
assure them they're in good hands,

04:15.338 --> 04:17.632
even though
the entire French staff walked out.

04:17.715 --> 04:18.967
Help me stop the bleeding.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.009
[In French] Let's go.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.719
[in English] Actually, this can't wait.

04:21.803 --> 04:22.929
[Madeline] <i>Bonjour.</i>

04:23.805 --> 04:25.306
Hi. <i>Bonjour,</i> Emily.

04:26.349 --> 04:27.183
<i>Bonjour.</i>

04:27.725 --> 04:29.185
[in French] What a surprise.

04:32.146 --> 04:33.648
[chuckles nervously]

04:34.691 --> 04:39.279
[in English] Antoine, you have built
an elite and exclusive brand,

04:39.362 --> 04:42.865
but the former regime
could only take it so far.

04:43.616 --> 04:47.370
It's time to elevate Maison Lavaux
to the next level.

04:47.453 --> 04:51.874
And, Gabriel, as for your restaurant,
it's time to say the magic word.

04:53.793 --> 04:54.627
Franchising.

04:56.379 --> 04:59.799
We're here
to make all of your dreams come true.

05:00.258 --> 05:01.676
-Hmm?
-Mmm.

05:02.593 --> 05:04.470
And how much do these dreams cost?

05:04.554 --> 05:06.139
You'll be making so much money,

05:06.222 --> 05:08.224
our standard fee
will be a drop in the bucket.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.767
[chuckles]

05:09.892 --> 05:10.893
I see.

05:12.103 --> 05:15.732
And how will two Americans
navigate the French luxury market?

05:15.815 --> 05:19.819
We are currently preparing
to onboard new French employees

05:19.902 --> 05:23.114
and we will ensure
that the transition is seamless

05:23.197 --> 05:24.991
before we head back to the States.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.286
Uh, you're not staying in Paris?

05:29.245 --> 05:32.832
Uh… Well, we're still
sorting all that out.

05:33.374 --> 05:35.626
But it won't affect our relationship.

05:37.378 --> 05:39.005
Uh, as your marketing agency.

05:39.839 --> 05:40.840
[Madeline] Exactly.

05:40.923 --> 05:43.384
Relationships are what
this business is all about,

05:43.468 --> 05:45.636
and Emily has established
a strong one here.

05:46.554 --> 05:49.349
I'm sure you both know
what she's capable of.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.231
Madeline, I--

05:57.315 --> 05:59.192
Great job. I think we've hooked them.

05:59.275 --> 06:01.652
You've got that chef
wrapped around your finger.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.404
That is so not true.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.822
I call 'em like I see 'em.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.449
I really need to talk to you.

06:06.532 --> 06:09.202
No, no, no, I need to talk to you.
Me first.

06:10.995 --> 06:15.291
[sighs] Em, the way you have
stepped in for me here,

06:16.584 --> 06:17.752
it's made me so proud.

06:17.835 --> 06:20.630
I mean, the minute
you walked into my office in Chicago,

06:20.713 --> 06:22.799
I knew just how special you were,

06:22.882 --> 06:27.387
and I was so excited to mentor you
and empower you

06:27.470 --> 06:30.807
so that you could empower
a future generation of women.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.892
OMG. Hormone tsunami.

06:33.684 --> 06:34.685
I'm sorry.

06:37.438 --> 06:38.564
So, so proud.

06:39.982 --> 06:41.776
-[chuckles nervously]
-[cell phone rings]

06:41.859 --> 06:44.695
It's early. You're blowing up. OMG Doug?

06:44.779 --> 06:46.406
I didn't know you were in touch.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.825
We haven't talked in months.
Must be a butt dial.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.410
Or he realizes what he's let go of.

06:50.493 --> 06:54.288
Just as you're prepping to go back.
Could be fate calling.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.416
-It's not.
-We'll see.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.626
I've got a Zoom meeting
and a doctor's appointment,

06:58.709 --> 07:00.378
so you won't see me the rest of the day.

07:00.461 --> 07:03.339
I've directed the French resumes
to be sent to your email,

07:03.423 --> 07:06.092
so comb through them
and get those interviews…

07:07.218 --> 07:09.053
set pronto. Bye.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.556
-[phone chimes]
-[Madeline exhales]

07:12.849 --> 07:15.184
[cell phone ringing]

07:15.268 --> 07:17.186
Doug, stop butt dialing me.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.481
Em, it's not my butt.
It's me. I meant to call you.

07:21.065 --> 07:22.483
Oh, why?

07:22.567 --> 07:24.694
Okay, big career announcement.

07:24.777 --> 07:30.324
Say hello to the Associate Manager
of Global Partnerships for McDonald's.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.660
Wait, did you say global?

07:32.743 --> 07:34.787
Because you haven't even been to Canada.

07:34.871 --> 07:35.955
That's the best part.

07:36.038 --> 07:38.040
I'm at corporate, right here in Chicago.

07:38.124 --> 07:42.211
I didn't even have to switch trains.
Dream job, baby! Whoo!

07:42.295 --> 07:45.006
Congratulations.
It's exactly what you deserve.

07:45.089 --> 07:46.382
Hey, thanks.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.635
It's good news for both of us
because, get this,

07:50.136 --> 07:53.181
McDonald's is looking for
a marketing agency in France

07:53.264 --> 07:55.308
to launch the McBaguette.

07:55.391 --> 07:57.018
That sounds like a huge account.

07:57.101 --> 07:59.270
It's epic. Huge payday.

07:59.353 --> 08:00.771
You're the person for it.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.273
<i>You're going to crush this.</i>

08:02.356 --> 08:05.443
I just sent you my boss' contact info.
He's in Paris tomorrow.

08:06.110 --> 08:09.572
Everybody's going to want this,
but it's all tee'd up for you.

08:09.780 --> 08:12.617
Wow. Thanks, Doug.

08:19.582 --> 08:22.710
-Oh!
-I'm sorry. <i>Pardon.</i>

08:23.961 --> 08:25.713
Emily, <i>bonjour.</i>

08:25.796 --> 08:27.089
Hi. What've I missed?

08:27.173 --> 08:30.551
We don't have an office space,
we don't have a name for the company,

08:30.635 --> 08:33.638
we don't have as many clients
coming with us as we thought.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.139
I might be able to help you.

08:35.223 --> 08:36.224
[Sylvie] Ah! Here's <i>Emily.</i>

08:36.766 --> 08:39.227
I was beginning to wonder
if you were joining us.

08:39.310 --> 08:41.270
What? Of course I'm joining you.

08:41.354 --> 08:45.024
I'm so in on
team whatever this company's called.

08:45.107 --> 08:48.861
You can help us choose.
I like Usine d'Insolence.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.112
It means Sass Factory.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.657
No, something more heroic.

08:52.740 --> 08:54.575
You know, les Gardiens de la Porte.

08:54.659 --> 08:55.993
That is The Gatekeepers.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.453
Sounds like a Marvel movie.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.248
Please stop.
I can't hear anymore awful names today.

09:01.666 --> 09:04.669
What I need from you is a sexy new client

09:04.752 --> 09:07.088
in the luxury space
to pair with the launch.

09:07.171 --> 09:08.297
I have just the thing.

09:09.131 --> 09:10.550
McDonald's.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.553
They're looking
for a French marketing firm

09:13.636 --> 09:15.179
to launch the McBaguette.

09:15.721 --> 09:18.349
<i>Mais oui,</i> the Golden Arches.

09:18.474 --> 09:22.228
Emily, the only baguettes
I'm interested in are diamonds.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.064
What's going on
with the Boucheron account?

09:25.189 --> 09:26.732
Uh, uh…

09:26.816 --> 09:28.150
Julien. <i>Le…</i>

09:28.234 --> 09:29.986
We're almost finished
with the presentation

09:30.069 --> 09:31.445
-and we'll set the meeting.
-Great.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.281
I think that you should reconsider.

09:33.864 --> 09:34.865
They're a major client

09:34.949 --> 09:36.617
-and it's a huge fee.
-[knocking on door]

09:36.701 --> 09:39.078
I heard you the first time, Emily.

09:39.912 --> 09:43.416
Our priority now is to make sure
every account follows us from Savoir.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.918
Good morning, <i>monsieur.</i>

09:46.002 --> 09:50.965
Welcome to the next chapter
of our formidable partnership.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.718
Gentlemen, ladies.

09:53.801 --> 09:54.677
Emily.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.555
[in English] Uh, yeah, what she said.

10:05.813 --> 10:07.940
Thanks for not saying anything, I'm still…

10:08.024 --> 10:09.108
Playing the field?

10:09.859 --> 10:11.902
Making sure you get the best deal?

10:11.986 --> 10:12.987
Like us.

10:13.696 --> 10:16.824
That's not what I'm doing, okay.
I'm committed to Sylvie.

10:16.907 --> 10:18.409
You're very talented, Emily,

10:18.492 --> 10:20.703
but Sylvie only cares about one thing.

10:20.786 --> 10:21.621
Sylvie.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.457
You should give this some more thought.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.293
I'm needed at the office.

10:27.376 --> 10:28.919
[in French] Have a good day.

10:35.092 --> 10:36.427
[in English] Are you okay?

10:36.510 --> 10:39.263
-What did you do to your hair?
-They're just bangs!

10:39.930 --> 10:42.183
Sometimes people cut bangs
when everything's fine!

10:45.019 --> 10:46.103
Sorry, I'm just…

10:47.438 --> 10:49.398
I tried to quit at Savoir this morning,

10:49.482 --> 10:52.735
and then I tried to pitch McDonald's
as a luxury client to Sylvie.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.570
So, no, I'm not okay.

10:55.404 --> 10:56.447
Hmm.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.199
That's not such a bad idea.

10:58.282 --> 10:59.867
You don't have to say that.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.994
Have you been to a McDonald's in Paris?

11:02.078 --> 11:03.204
No. Why?

11:03.412 --> 11:04.538
Hmm.

11:04.622 --> 11:05.873
Let me take you to lunch.

11:11.045 --> 11:12.463
-Okay.
-After you.

11:13.047 --> 11:13.964
<i>Merci.</i>

11:21.180 --> 11:25.559
This is so chic.
There's no Grimace, no Hamburglar.

11:26.268 --> 11:27.687
What's a Hamburglar?

11:28.688 --> 11:29.605
Never mind.

11:34.694 --> 11:38.239
[Emily] It's still McDonald's,
but it's adapted to the French culture.

11:38.322 --> 11:39.573
Sounds like someone I know.

11:40.199 --> 11:43.035
I can't believe a French chef
is a regular at McDonald's.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.037
Mmm-mmm. I don't come here every day.

11:45.121 --> 11:48.207
It's what we call <i>"un petit plaisir".</i>

11:48.958 --> 11:49.917
A little…

11:50.000 --> 11:50.876
Treat.

11:52.670 --> 11:53.629
Indulgence?

11:54.922 --> 11:57.425
Or a luxury.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.135
See, you can sell it.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.345
You have to decide who you're working for.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.180
I really did choose Sylvie.

12:03.806 --> 12:07.977
I just went to tell Madeline
I quit this morning and… I couldn't.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.521
Maybe you didn't want to tell her.

12:11.939 --> 12:15.234
You had the chance to say how you felt
and… you didn't.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.531
About the other day…

12:21.782 --> 12:23.701
There's so much more
I wish I could tell you.

12:23.784 --> 12:25.953
Emily, we can't keep doing this.

12:26.036 --> 12:27.580
I'm with Camille, you're with Alfie.

12:27.663 --> 12:29.415
-I know.
-And Alfie's great.

12:30.624 --> 12:31.792
I like him.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.169
And I like him for you.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.295
So do I.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.505
It's just complicated.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.258
He's going back to London tomorrow night.

12:39.341 --> 12:40.634
[Emily sighs]

12:41.093 --> 12:44.513
I should've planned something,
but everything's just been so chaotic.

12:45.389 --> 12:49.143
Maybe I could reserve some tables
at the restaurant.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.479
Tomorrow night? At 8:00?

12:51.562 --> 12:53.105
You'd do that for me?

12:53.689 --> 12:57.026
And for me.
He scored three goals last week.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.068
Thank you.

12:59.111 --> 12:59.987
For everything.

13:01.655 --> 13:02.782
Of course.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.158
That's what friends do.

13:10.414 --> 13:11.499
Ah!

13:11.582 --> 13:14.835
My DMs have been on fire since Belleville.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.755
Here, help me pick one.
Or two. Or three at most.

13:17.838 --> 13:18.672
Oh, my God.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.634
People send you photos like this
on Instagram?

13:21.717 --> 13:24.678
Anything's a sex app
if you want it bad enough.

13:24.762 --> 13:27.139
It's the only reason
I still have Facebook.

13:27.681 --> 13:29.683
-[both laugh]
-Thank you. See you there.

13:30.684 --> 13:31.519
Yes!

13:33.062 --> 13:35.022
Hi, what was that for?

13:35.105 --> 13:37.066
That was for the gig we booked tonight.

13:37.149 --> 13:37.983
What?

13:38.067 --> 13:41.904
The manager at La Trompette Bleue,
this amazing jazz club here in St. Germain

13:41.987 --> 13:43.572
saw the video of our Belleville set.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.950
He invited us to their open mic night.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.409
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

13:47.493 --> 13:50.788
-We're singing at a jazz club. Yes!
-Jazz club!

13:53.415 --> 13:58.587
[all in French] "Choose, I choose,
you choose,

13:58.671 --> 14:04.510

14:04.593 --> 14:05.970
Very good.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.472
[in English] Now, who can translate this?

14:10.057 --> 14:10.891
Emily?

14:11.225 --> 14:12.476
Um…

14:12.852 --> 14:15.187
Not choosing is still choosing?

14:15.271 --> 14:16.230
[in French] Excellent.

14:16.313 --> 14:19.775
-[in English] But what does it mean?
-Oh, là-là. Um…

14:19.859 --> 14:22.027
How to explain existentialism?

14:22.194 --> 14:23.612
You've heard of Sartre?

14:24.697 --> 14:27.533
He believed humans are condemned
to make choices

14:27.616 --> 14:30.578
to define themselves
in an absurd world with no rules.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.248
Even not choosing has consequences,
so it's still a choice.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.792
But how do we know
we're making the right one?

14:36.876 --> 14:38.544
To Sartre there was no right or wrong.

14:38.627 --> 14:41.255
You simply choose with conviction
and live your life.

14:41.338 --> 14:43.257
Well, that's not helpful at all.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.676
No one said existentialism was helpful.

14:45.759 --> 14:46.844
Existentialism?

14:46.927 --> 14:49.305
I thought this was French 1.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.099

14:53.100 --> 14:55.060

14:57.062 --> 14:59.398
You'll have to wait
until the end of the class.

15:00.024 --> 15:02.109
Yeah. I'm more than happy to wait.

15:03.736 --> 15:04.653
That was a lie.

Right. Sorry.

16:48.215 --> 16:49.883
Yeah. I leave tomorrow.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.469

to prep this presentation

-What?

23:34.538 --> 23:39.876
It's a spoil of war now. And I didn't
back up anything into the cloud.

23:40.710 --> 23:42.170
I don't trust the cloud.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.548
You need to go there and get it!

23:44.631 --> 23:50.303
Into enemy territory? Madeline could have
me arrested for trespassing. Or worse.

23:50.387 --> 23:52.514
And what do you think Sylvie will do

23:52.597 --> 23:55.267
when she finds out
you've lost all of your client files?

23:58.311 --> 23:59.146
You're right.

24:00.147 --> 24:02.649
At least Madeline is too pregnant
to chase me.

24:06.528 --> 24:08.822
Why is everyone so stupid today?

24:15.787 --> 24:17.539
[humming indistinctly]

24:19.416 --> 24:20.375
[gasps]

24:20.667 --> 24:22.752
[in French] Hello, Madeline, how are you?

24:22.836 --> 24:24.588
[in English] What are you doing here?

24:24.671 --> 24:27.924
No, just collecting
a few personal items I left behind.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.886
No time to pack during a coup?

24:30.969 --> 24:33.388
Well, grab your stuff and go.
I'm very busy.

24:33.597 --> 24:36.933
Madeline, I'm sorry we left you all alone.

24:37.017 --> 24:39.895
You're not sorry.
And I'm not alone, I still have Emily.

24:39.978 --> 24:41.271
No, no, Emily's with us.

24:42.564 --> 24:45.567
Emily's working remotely today
because she doesn't feel well.

24:45.859 --> 24:48.320
No, no, no.
She works for Sylvie's new company.

24:50.030 --> 24:50.864
Right.

24:52.282 --> 24:54.409
-Sylvie's new company.
-Yeah.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.871
She's there now working on
the presentation for the McBaguette.

24:58.038 --> 25:01.708
-[chuckles]
-Her Chicago connections were a big help.

25:02.667 --> 25:03.502
Amazing.

25:03.585 --> 25:10.550
And we are meeting with
the McDonald's representative tonight.

25:12.969 --> 25:14.554
You're pitching Mickie D's.

25:16.515 --> 25:17.807
[laughs]

25:18.016 --> 25:20.393
I'm sorry. I knew that. I knew that.

25:20.477 --> 25:25.148
Yeah, I'd love to send over
a magnum of champagne to the table,

25:25.232 --> 25:26.733
just to wish Emily well.

25:26.816 --> 25:29.861
That is very magnanimous of you.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.571
Stop, she's earned it.

25:32.239 --> 25:33.448
Where's the dinner?

25:55.637 --> 25:56.555
Are you all right?

25:56.638 --> 25:57.472
What?

25:58.014 --> 25:59.307
Yes, of course.

25:59.933 --> 26:02.352
Just a little déjà vu.

26:02.435 --> 26:04.563
Along with some existential angst.

26:05.397 --> 26:08.024
I've had to make
a lot of big life decisions lately.

26:08.525 --> 26:11.695
Yeah, I meant to ask
how Madeline took the news.

26:11.778 --> 26:13.947
I'm sure it wasn't an easy thing to do.

26:15.115 --> 26:15.949
Well…

26:16.533 --> 26:18.201
I know you thought of her as a mentor.

26:19.286 --> 26:20.954
And though our styles may differ,

26:21.037 --> 26:24.082
I hope, in time,
you'll see me in the same way.

26:24.916 --> 26:25.917
Thank you.

26:26.835 --> 26:27.836
It means a lot.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.006
Your success is my success.

26:31.756 --> 26:33.258
We're in this together, aren't we?

26:34.259 --> 26:36.803
I know by joining me,
you're taking a big leap.

26:38.179 --> 26:39.723
[screaming]

26:39.806 --> 26:41.141
The client has arrived.

26:43.893 --> 26:45.270
What's wrong with her?

26:47.772 --> 26:48.773
Nothing.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.609
I'm fine. Everything's fine.

26:51.526 --> 26:52.694
[chuckles] Um…

26:53.320 --> 26:55.280
Time to turn on that Chicago charm.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.825
Whatever that means.

27:03.204 --> 27:04.372
Hey.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.373
Here he is.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.667
Evening, all.
All right, first round's on me.

27:07.751 --> 27:10.337
-No, drinks are on us tonight.
<i>-Merci,</i> love.

27:11.296 --> 27:13.214
-Is Emily here?
-Oh, she's coming.

27:13.298 --> 27:15.425
I think she got caught up with some work.

27:15.508 --> 27:18.053
Yeah, she'll be here soon.
She adores you so much.

27:19.679 --> 27:20.513
Right.

27:20.597 --> 27:23.099
-[cell phone rings]
-Excuse me, I should take this.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.186
I need to check something in the kitchen.

27:26.269 --> 27:27.729
Yeah, do your thing, mate.

27:27.812 --> 27:29.648
I need to introduce you to someone.

27:29.731 --> 27:30.732
Come.

27:30.815 --> 27:32.317
Antoine, this is Alfie.

27:32.400 --> 27:33.735
-Antoine.
-Alfie. <i>Enchanté.</i>

27:33.818 --> 27:35.278
Absolute pleasure, mate.

27:35.362 --> 27:37.280
Antoine has something for you.

27:37.364 --> 27:39.032
A little gift from Maison Lavaux.

27:39.115 --> 27:40.116
Oh, wow.

27:40.200 --> 27:43.745
Emily remembered it was your favorite
at the Labo Lavo event, so…

27:43.828 --> 27:46.539
Thank you… That smells amazing.

27:46.623 --> 27:48.083
Thank you. Happy you like it.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.209
Um…

27:49.751 --> 27:51.336
If you don't mind me saying,

27:51.419 --> 27:54.506
how come I've never heard of Maison Lavaux
before I came here?

27:54.589 --> 27:55.840
We're an exclusive brand.

27:55.924 --> 27:58.176
I've toyed with the idea
of expanding to mass markets,

27:58.259 --> 28:00.762
but it's risky to grow
and still maintain our independence.

28:01.221 --> 28:04.015
And our tax laws aren't exactly friendly
to businessmen.

28:04.099 --> 28:04.933
I hear that.

28:05.016 --> 28:07.268
There are plenty of ways
around the French tax system.

28:07.352 --> 28:10.397
Trust me. I've spent the past year
learning the ins and outs.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.566
My bank in London
have financed plenty of French companies

28:13.650 --> 28:15.151
that couldn't get capitalized here.

28:15.610 --> 28:16.611
Hmm.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.822
-What are you drinking?
-Scotch. Neat.

28:19.447 --> 28:20.615
Make it two.

28:22.158 --> 28:24.285
Sorry, it's loud in here. Can you hear me?

28:24.369 --> 28:25.495
[Raphael] <i>Yeah, perfectly.</i>

28:26.663 --> 28:28.665
Did you enjoy yourself on stage
the other night?

28:28.748 --> 28:31.084
Yes, yes, it was amazing.

28:31.167 --> 28:33.670
How'd you feel
about doing it on a regular basis?

28:33.753 --> 28:36.047
-Oh, my God, are you serious?
<i>-Absolutely.</i>

28:36.631 --> 28:39.342
The audience was very impressed.
And so was I.

28:40.385 --> 28:42.762
Oh, my God, the guys
are going to be so excited.

28:43.346 --> 28:45.223
<i>Actually, this offer is only for you.</i>

28:45.306 --> 28:48.143
Your bandmates are wonderful,
but we've got a house band.

28:48.435 --> 28:49.519
Oh.

28:50.145 --> 28:51.146
Shit.

28:51.229 --> 28:52.188
<i>What was that?</i>

28:52.272 --> 28:56.401
I said I need to sit on it.
Think about it. Is that okay?

28:56.484 --> 28:58.611
Of course. Let me know as soon as you can.

28:59.988 --> 29:02.407
-Hi. You're here.
-Mindy!

29:02.490 --> 29:03.825
-Hey, baby.
-Hey, baby.

29:05.160 --> 29:06.536
[jazz music playing]

29:10.248 --> 29:14.294
And the good news is the French
are really quite fond of McDonald.

29:14.377 --> 29:16.755
[Emily] They think of it
as a little luxury.

29:16.838 --> 29:21.509
Which is why we were thinking of
this classy retro vibe for the campaign.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.762
Do you know
the George Gershwin song "'S Wonderful?"

29:23.845 --> 29:24.971
Of course.

29:25.054 --> 29:28.641
He's the original <i>American in Paris</i>
and the song is perfect for this campaign.

29:29.100 --> 29:31.895
We would change the lyrics
from 'S Wonderful to

29:31.978 --> 29:35.815
McWonderful, McMarvelous, McParadise…

29:35.899 --> 29:38.818
-McBaguette.
<i>-Exactement.</i> [chuckles]

29:39.235 --> 29:41.488
Well, I've got to say, I'm lovin' it.

29:41.571 --> 29:43.072
And we are loving it too.

29:43.198 --> 29:44.491
[all laugh]

29:44.574 --> 29:48.703
Doug told me you'd be just the team
for the job, and I think he was right.

29:48.787 --> 29:49.788
Excuse me.

29:52.373 --> 29:56.419
Scott Thomas, <i>enchantée.</i>
Madeline Wheeler, Head of Savoir.

29:56.503 --> 29:58.922
The company you were
supposed to be meeting with tonight.

29:59.005 --> 30:00.882
I thought she was in charge.

30:00.965 --> 30:03.134
No, no, this woman no longer works for us.

30:03.218 --> 30:06.554
And this woman is apparently suffering
from Stockholm Syndrome?

30:06.638 --> 30:08.014
Madeline, wait…

30:08.097 --> 30:10.558
Emily brought this client to me.

30:10.642 --> 30:13.186
That's impossible
because Emily still works for me.

30:13.937 --> 30:15.855
Unless there's something I don't know.

30:17.899 --> 30:19.609
You never quit.

30:20.944 --> 30:22.278
I intended to.

30:22.362 --> 30:26.658
But she's pregnant and alone
in a foreign country, okay?

30:26.741 --> 30:28.827
I want to work with both of you until--

30:28.910 --> 30:32.664
Until what? You could abandon me?
I shepherded your whole career.

30:33.248 --> 30:34.666
How could you do this to me?

30:34.916 --> 30:35.917
[squeals]

30:36.459 --> 30:38.086
Oh. [groans]

30:38.169 --> 30:39.003
Pee.

30:39.504 --> 30:40.380
[gasps]

30:41.673 --> 30:42.841
Wait. No.

30:44.092 --> 30:45.218
Oh, my God.

30:45.802 --> 30:46.803
My water just broke.

30:47.554 --> 30:49.764
Yes, all over my shoes.

30:49.848 --> 30:53.560
Okay, I am not loving it so much anymore.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.606
[in French] Take her to the
American Hospital in Neuilly.

30:59.190 --> 31:01.860
[in English] Madeline, you're going
to be in excellent hands.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.236
You're going to be fine.

31:03.319 --> 31:05.697
I'm going to go with her.
Mads, I'm going to come with you.

31:05.780 --> 31:08.741
No, don't Mads me.
I can't even look at you right now.

31:10.827 --> 31:11.661
Sorry.

31:14.956 --> 31:17.584
So this was your existential angst?

31:18.585 --> 31:20.628
Or were you just trying to have it all?

31:20.712 --> 31:22.213
That is so American.

31:22.297 --> 31:27.302
I really want to work with you.
But it just all got so complicated.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.137
Let me make it simple for you.

31:33.308 --> 31:34.559
You're fired.

31:50.950 --> 31:54.120
Oh, hi. Oh, my God. Alfie, I'm so sorry.

31:55.038 --> 31:57.206
Madeline went into labor
and Sylvie fired me

31:57.290 --> 31:58.875
and I couldn't find a cab.

31:58.958 --> 31:59.959
Emily, just stop.

32:01.127 --> 32:04.005
I get it.
I know your career means a lot to you.

32:05.214 --> 32:07.383
I just didn't realize
it meant more than us.

32:07.967 --> 32:11.596
No. No, you mean so much to me.

32:11.679 --> 32:13.389
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

32:14.223 --> 32:15.892
So when are you coming to London?

32:16.643 --> 32:17.560
Uh…

32:17.644 --> 32:19.896
I haven't decided yet.

32:21.689 --> 32:22.857
Yeah, I think you have.

32:24.734 --> 32:27.236
No, where are you going? Come on.

32:27.320 --> 32:28.780
What's that French saying?

32:29.489 --> 32:30.907
From that Sartre guy?

32:33.076 --> 32:35.286
Not choosing is still a choice.

32:38.414 --> 32:39.415
Wait, I…

32:42.669 --> 32:45.880
Please, I… Can we just talk about this? I…

32:47.590 --> 32:49.217
I'm so sorry.

32:51.260 --> 32:52.178
Later, Cooper.

33:14.367 --> 33:16.369
[theme music playing]
