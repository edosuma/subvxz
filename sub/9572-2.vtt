Okay.
Hey, hey, we should
take Claire on that tour.

00:38.515 --> 00:41.557
She's probably already gone.
She lives in the neighborhood.

00:41.557 --> 00:43.682
I might want to go, Ron.

00:43.682 --> 00:46.057
You're a grown-ass woman.
You do what you want.

00:46.057 --> 00:48.557
Come on. Let's find
this damn place.
Thank you so much.

00:48.557 --> 00:51.016
Sharon: If we had
parked closer...

00:51.016 --> 00:53.016
Wait. This left

So it's the red tape

Aha.

01:06.223 --> 01:09.432
Hey. Do you think
that we should get
Claire some mace?

01:09.432 --> 01:12.765
Yeah, maybe.
I don't like that there's
bars on the windows.

01:12.765 --> 01:15.557
Do you know
what doesn't have bars
on the windows?

01:15.557 --> 01:18.724
A hotel.
All right.
That'll be enough of that.

01:18.724 --> 01:21.016
Oh. Hello.

01:21.016 --> 01:22.807
Hey. Afternoon.

01:22.807 --> 01:24.849
Hello.
Cute kitty.

01:28.807 --> 01:31.515
A cat on a leash?
That's freaky, right?

01:31.515 --> 01:33.682
All right,
there we go.
Oh good.

01:35.265 --> 01:38.599
The whole building,
850K and upward.

01:38.599 --> 01:41.182
It's crazy.

01:41.182 --> 01:44.473
Oh God.
What a dump.

01:44.473 --> 01:47.182
Well, high ceilings,
plenty of light.

01:47.182 --> 01:50.016
Okay, that's insane.

01:50.016 --> 01:52.765
The bathroom door
doesn't even open
all the way.

01:52.765 --> 01:55.016
Yeah, well, you know,
it adds character.

01:55.016 --> 01:57.891
Eww. Eww. Oh! Ron!

01:57.891 --> 02:00.682

Ron:
Man, I got to get these
compression socks off.

02:04.223 --> 02:07.724
Honey, no!
You don't know
who has sat on that thing.

02:07.724 --> 02:12.974
And don't put your bare feet
on that filthy carpet.

Wait.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.807
Where's the bedroom?

02:24.016 --> 02:25.307
I think
it's up there.

02:28.141 --> 02:29.141
Up this ladder?

02:29.141 --> 02:31.557
Uh-huh.
No, no. No. No.

02:31.557 --> 02:34.057
There is never a Sleep Number
at the top of a ladder.

02:34.057 --> 02:35.849
It'd be like sleeping
in a tree house.

02:35.849 --> 02:39.390
Oh, please, Aunt Sue.
Let's see how whimsical
you're feeling

you get up to pee tonight.

02:42.557 --> 02:44.016
Ron:
Hey, settle down.

02:44.016 --> 02:46.640
Claire thinks
she's doing us
a good thing.

02:46.640 --> 02:49.432
It's cheaper than a hotel,
and besides, we--

02:49.432 --> 02:51.432
Oh, oh, hell no.
What?

02:51.432 --> 02:52.640
Hell no!
What is it?

02:52.640 --> 02:54.473

over there!

02:54.473 --> 02:57.974
Oh my...

02:57.974 --> 03:01.724
Yes, Ron.
It's just like
a tree house,

03:01.724 --> 03:03.515
with a snake
and everything.

03:03.515 --> 03:04.891
It's like
The Jungle Book.

03:04.891 --> 03:07.390
Is it in the ad?
Did they have it in the ad?

03:07.390 --> 03:09.141
I don't know.
I never saw the ad.

03:09.141 --> 03:13.599
You are the one, Ron,
who was okay with Claire
picking us a place.

03:13.599 --> 03:16.682
A fucking snake in a box.
Hey.

03:16.682 --> 03:18.515
Do you know where
there are no snakes?

03:18.515 --> 03:20.265
Shut up!

Sharon:
Yup, we got in okay.

03:22.348 --> 03:24.599
Found parking
a few blocks away.

03:24.599 --> 03:25.849
It was a little bit
of a walk.

03:25.849 --> 03:30.599
Oh, honey,
is this neighborhood
safe for the car?

03:30.599 --> 03:33.099
Well, I know,
but you never know.

03:33.099 --> 03:36.348
No. Yes. The place...

03:36.348 --> 03:40.599
No. That hotel is
too expensive. It is.

03:40.599 --> 03:42.473
No, honey,
the place is fine.

03:42.473 --> 03:44.265
Thank you so much
for setting it up.

03:44.265 --> 03:47.141
Yup. Oh no,
we are in a loft.

It is all happening.

Wait. What? Oh. Umm...

03:53.432 --> 03:56.640
Claire didn't know
there was a snake.
Oh, it's in the ad.

03:56.640 --> 03:58.557
The snake's name is Fagin.

03:58.557 --> 03:59.849
She didn't even read it.
Sharon:
Fagin?

Okay, honey,
your dad is freaked out,
needless to say.

04:02.932 --> 04:06.016

I was so stressing out
about it.

Well, it's illegal,

Don't even bother.

10:16.765 --> 10:19.765
We love Derek, okay?

10:19.765 --> 10:23.432
Our snakes...
are friends.

10:26.724 --> 10:30.099
Snake club, bi-atch!

Get in, get in.
Lock the door!

10:36.724 --> 10:39.724

is trying to get away
from her.

10:39.724 --> 10:41.432
She's a fucking
crazy freak.

10:41.432 --> 10:45.640
"Snake club, bitch!"
"Snake club, bitch!"

10:45.640 --> 10:48.307
Careful there.

10:52.515 --> 10:55.016
Do we have any more?
Do we have the second joint?

10:55.016 --> 10:56.515
Come on!
Ron:
Hold up.

10:56.515 --> 10:58.682
Double up.
Sharon: Get out!
You're a cheater.

10:58.682 --> 11:00.099
Okay.

11:01.557 --> 11:04.515
Ho, ho! She scores
right off the bat.

11:06.849 --> 11:09.473
I almost scored
my own goal.

11:09.473 --> 11:11.932
Let's say you get points
if you score your own goal.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.599
Then you would lose.
I'll lose.

11:15.099 --> 11:17.307
This is fun.

11:17.307 --> 11:21.473
Ah! I scored!
Boo! Boo!

11:21.473 --> 11:22.974
Ah...
Boo!

11:32.432 --> 11:35.932
God. God.
I feel better already.

11:35.932 --> 11:38.974
I didn't like those girls.
Which girls?

11:38.974 --> 11:42.348
You know, Claire's friends,
Bea and Jovon.

11:42.348 --> 11:46.182
No.
Honey, Jov...

11:46.182 --> 11:48.515
Jovon is a young man.

11:48.515 --> 11:50.182
Oh. Messed that up.

11:50.182 --> 11:54.807

there's no such thing as gender,
so what the hell do I know?

I gotta go to the bathroom.

we're always, talking, talking.
I thought last week,

we decided that this week

14:16.265 --> 14:20.724
we were gonna set

The first march was, "Ah!"

14:50.765 --> 14:54.724
I mean, I stayed--
Actually, the first march
was super safe.

14:54.724 --> 14:57.599
It wasn't that crazy.
Rachel:
It was a lot of anger--

14:57.599 --> 15:00.932
It actually wasn't very violent,
which is not a positive thing.

15:00.932 --> 15:02.891
What are you talking about?
That's a great thing.

15:02.891 --> 15:05.807
Molly: Everyone was like,
"Oh, it was so peaceful.
Good job, protesters."

15:05.807 --> 15:08.390
The police decide
whether they escalate
something or not,

15:08.390 --> 15:11.057
so I'm not interested
in praising the police

15:11.057 --> 15:12.640
for not beating
the hell out of people.

15:12.640 --> 15:15.724
In Ferguson,
the police react very
differently to the protesters,

15:15.724 --> 15:17.057
and that's because of racism.

15:17.057 --> 15:19.182
And the fact is that we should
not be praising the police

15:19.182 --> 15:21.182

against white people.

They wouldn't act.

15:29.265 --> 15:30.640

I know.

15:30.640 --> 15:32.348
I got a gun.
I got a gun!

See-- No, no, no. Wait.
I have a feeling-- Okay.

Come on.

15:37.807 --> 15:40.432
Shit is going down, ladies,

15:40.432 --> 15:42.682
and if I'm going

I don't wanna show up armed
with my amazing ideals.

15:45.891 --> 15:48.057
I wanna show up
with an actual gun.

15:48.057 --> 15:51.432
What-- No. What do
you think is going to happen
when you come with a gun?

15:51.432 --> 15:54.223
People use guns.
No, no, I knew
you wouldn't like it,

15:54.223 --> 15:56.724

things are changing.

15:56.724 --> 15:58.765

was going to happen,

15:58.765 --> 16:00.473

The rules have changed.

16:00.473 --> 16:02.682
You're gonna shoot yourself
in the leg is what's
gonna happen.

16:02.682 --> 16:04.515
I'm not gonna
shoot myself.
Or someone else.

16:04.515 --> 16:07.682
Once you bring a gun out,
more guns come out.
Yes, exactly. That's correct.

16:07.682 --> 16:09.807
Do you know how to use it?

16:09.807 --> 16:11.724
I don't-- I mean,
how hard could it be?

16:11.724 --> 16:14.932
I have a master's. I'm sure
I can figure out how to--

16:14.932 --> 16:16.599
Barry:
In literature though, right?
Yeah.

16:16.599 --> 16:18.807
Are you kidding?
That's great.

16:18.807 --> 16:20.974
You think you can
show up to a "gun fight"?

16:20.974 --> 16:23.432
What do you mean?
Against the police?
Against who?

16:23.432 --> 16:24.849

Listen, it's a new paradigm.

16:24.849 --> 16:27.390

16:27.390 --> 16:31.141
Okay, I'm sensing a lot
of negativity from you.
Ollie: I think you're a badass,

16:31.141 --> 16:32.765

that you can take it.
Thank you.

16:32.765 --> 16:36.974

Hi! Oh my God,

16:36.974 --> 16:39.515

Here, take this.

16:41.223 --> 16:43.099

so much stuff.
I know.

16:43.099 --> 16:45.141

of magenta.

16:45.141 --> 16:48.057
Where's your friend, Nayima?
Oh, she couldn't make it.

16:48.057 --> 16:50.057

ayahuasca trip.

16:50.057 --> 16:52.849

It's good to see you.

16:58.599 --> 17:00.515

Where's my little
mini

17:00.515 --> 17:01.974
Oh, she's upstairs
with the neighbor.

17:01.974 --> 17:03.974
Oh, what?
Play date.

17:03.974 --> 17:05.807
Aw. I'm a better play date.

17:05.807 --> 17:07.515
Oh.
Will she be back later?

17:07.515 --> 17:09.724
Yes, don't worry.
I brought food.

17:09.724 --> 17:13.640
Great.
And I got Malia
a little gift for being her.

17:13.640 --> 17:15.307
You're too sweet.
Thank you.

17:15.307 --> 17:16.807
Well, I was hoping
to give it to her myself.

17:16.807 --> 17:18.849
Okay. I'm sure
that can happen.
Maybe later.

17:18.849 --> 17:21.016
I'm gonna go join
the party.
Sure.

17:21.016 --> 17:22.849

Molly, Molly, Molly.
Molly: Hi, Camille.

17:22.849 --> 17:23.891
How are you?

17:26.141 --> 17:28.182
Camille got Malia
a black doll.

17:28.182 --> 17:31.016
Is that weird?
I mean, Malia is half black,

17:31.016 --> 17:33.765
and she should have
an abundance of black dolls

17:33.765 --> 17:36.182
of all different types,
which she does.
Yeah, but do you think

17:36.182 --> 17:37.849
she's trying
to tell us something?

17:37.849 --> 17:39.974
Like when she babysat,
did she take count

17:39.974 --> 17:42.891
of how many black dolls
and how many white dolls
she had or something?

17:42.891 --> 17:46.016
I put together
this little number.

17:46.016 --> 17:47.390
Women: Ahh!
Vulva!

17:47.390 --> 17:48.891
Cecily:
It's plush.
Whoa! It's so detailed.

17:48.891 --> 17:51.390
It has multiple... vulvas.
Oh my God. Wow.

17:51.390 --> 17:53.223
Where's the vagina?
This is vulva.

17:53.223 --> 17:54.891
You got--
You're all vulva right now.

17:54.891 --> 17:57.223
There is artistic license.
I imagined

17:57.223 --> 18:00.141
your vagina, Rachel,
when I made it. Yeah.

18:00.141 --> 18:02.057
Because, obviously,
look at the coloring.

18:02.057 --> 18:04.557
You know what it is?
It's tighter that I would think.

18:04.557 --> 18:06.765
Cecily's the only woman
of color here.

18:06.765 --> 18:08.265
Do you think she feels
okay with that?

18:08.265 --> 18:10.640
Well, I know
that we strive towards inclusion

18:10.640 --> 18:13.057
and representation always,
but it's okay.

18:13.057 --> 18:14.682
I'm trying to build
a safe space,

18:14.682 --> 18:16.724
and I was actually
really excited for Malia,

18:16.724 --> 18:18.599
to spend some time
with some women of color.

18:18.599 --> 18:20.974
Of course. Of course.
And we can make sure that
that happens.

18:20.974 --> 18:23.765
If it doesn't happen today,
that's only one time.
Who are you texting?

18:23.765 --> 18:27.265
I'm just inviting
a few more people
since we had some cancellations.

18:27.265 --> 18:30.265
Don't be weird.
I am not being weird.

18:31.765 --> 18:34.182
Your coat drive
went really well, though.

18:34.182 --> 18:36.724
Thank you.
It was a huge success.
That was great.

18:36.724 --> 18:38.682
Ooh, I should've
given you some coats.

18:38.682 --> 18:40.765
Yeah, you should've.
Sorry.

18:40.765 --> 18:44.016
It's okay.
We did really, really well.
Yeah.

18:44.016 --> 18:46.765
I kept one coat.
No, you didn't.

18:46.765 --> 18:49.141
Where that weed at, girl?
I know. Actually, we're out,

18:49.141 --> 18:51.724
but I was gonna order in.
You want?
Yes, I want.

18:51.724 --> 18:52.765
Let's do it.
Of course I want.

18:52.765 --> 18:55.182
You know what?
A hot glue gun.

18:55.182 --> 18:57.557
Yes.
Okay, well, plug it in.

18:57.557 --> 18:59.974
Katy Perry is
actually Jon Benet Ramsey.

18:59.974 --> 19:01.765
No. I saw-- yes.
Have you read that?

19:01.765 --> 19:03.849
And I did see this.
Why are you so--

19:03.849 --> 19:05.348
Why do you immediately
negate me?

19:05.348 --> 19:07.307
I know,

19:09.473 --> 19:11.891

19:29.473 --> 19:33.016

Well, I haven't seen this one

organizing these meet-ups,
and I'm glad you could come.

19:37.307 --> 19:40.099

You want a red wine?
Yes, please.

19:41.307 --> 19:44.265
This is, like, beautiful.
Just do this.

19:44.265 --> 19:46.182
Dude, your weed guy's
so fast.

19:46.182 --> 19:48.016

19:48.016 --> 19:50.182
Brenna, who's here?
Who did you invite?

19:50.182 --> 19:52.891
I just invited
a few more people.
Don't worry about it.

19:52.891 --> 19:54.557
We've got room.

19:54.557 --> 19:59.182
How do you know Brenna?
Oh, I actually don't.
We've never met.

19:59.182 --> 20:01.057
We just follow each other
on Instagram.

20:01.057 --> 20:02.682
She sent me a message.
She told me to come over.

20:02.682 --> 20:06.849
It was a mild winter.
I know. Remember that day,
70 in February?

20:06.849 --> 20:11.141
70 degrees in February.
You know, there are some good
things about global warming.

20:11.141 --> 20:14.099
It was really nice.
I mean, it's scary.
Just saying, you know?

20:14.099 --> 20:16.223
Hey, you doing all right?
You got wine?
Hey, girl. Yeah.

20:18.432 --> 20:22.807
Okay, so this isn't a deck
that I've ever really used.

20:22.807 --> 20:25.016
Ooh, whatever.
Tarot's tarot, no?

20:25.016 --> 20:27.057
In terms
of delineation of tasks,

20:27.057 --> 20:30.057
it is like a "Pump Up
the Jams" playlist.

20:30.057 --> 20:31.974
Of course, yeah.
I already started it.
Oh. Okay, great.

20:31.974 --> 20:34.016
Brenna:
Molly, I think Cary's early!

20:34.016 --> 20:36.557
Oh, it's the weed guy.
Wait. Weed guy?

20:36.557 --> 20:38.348
I thought we had a policy.

20:38.348 --> 20:39.974
I'm not okay with this.

20:39.974 --> 20:42.057
It's not like he's coming in
to hang out with us.

20:42.057 --> 20:44.182
Well, do you think
he'll mind if you buy weed
in the hall?

20:44.182 --> 20:47.182
Just for today?
The hallway? I'm not
buying weed in the hallway.

20:47.182 --> 20:49.891
What if somebody walks by?
I don't know!

20:49.891 --> 20:53.724
Molly, he just has
a really intense male look.

20:53.724 --> 20:54.932
He might trigger someone.

20:54.932 --> 20:57.348
I always use a service
that's all women.

20:57.348 --> 20:59.724
Really?
It's female owned,
female operated.

20:59.724 --> 21:01.390
Rachel: Amazing.
It's called CannaBitches.

21:01.390 --> 21:03.057
Rachel:
CannaBitches?
That's wonderful.

21:03.057 --> 21:05.057
It's gonna be fine.

21:06.974 --> 21:09.932
The Guy: Hey, hey.
What's up?
Hey.

21:09.932 --> 21:11.849
Nice to see you.
Hey, Brenna.
Nice to see you too.

21:11.849 --> 21:15.016
Hi. How are ya?
Oh, a party.
Can I take these off?

21:15.016 --> 21:17.182
Yes, thank you
very much.
Sure.

21:17.182 --> 21:19.390
Someone lost their cat.
Nice to see you.

21:19.390 --> 21:21.765
Nice to see you too.
All right, so listen.

21:21.765 --> 21:26.932
I want to let you know
that there's a palpable
feminine moon energy

21:26.932 --> 21:28.974
surging through
the space right now...
Okay.

21:28.974 --> 21:32.473
...and just you even being
a man could disrupt it,

21:32.473 --> 21:36.141
so just try
to be neutral, okay?

21:36.141 --> 21:39.182
Oh man. Should I go?
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on in.

21:39.182 --> 21:41.016
But just...

21:41.016 --> 21:42.099
The Guy:
Okay.

21:43.223 --> 21:44.765
It's fine.
Are you sure?

21:44.765 --> 21:46.473
Yeah.
Okay.

21:46.473 --> 21:49.223
Hey, you wanna
set up over here?
Uh, sure.

21:49.223 --> 21:51.141
Sure. Yeah. Sorry.

21:51.141 --> 21:54.599
Don't mean to take up
too much space.

21:54.599 --> 21:57.141
Totally fine.
We got room.
Oh yeah.

21:57.141 --> 22:00.473
Hold on a second.
This idea of male allies

22:00.473 --> 22:02.849
just reinforces
that we need their voice
to speak for us,

22:02.849 --> 22:05.348
that they validate our existence
and what we want.

22:05.348 --> 22:07.974
And, uh...
Well, how's the Amnesia Haze?

22:07.974 --> 22:12.599
Uh, you know, it's good, man--
ma'am. It's good.

22:12.599 --> 22:14.473
It's really good. Uh...

22:14.473 --> 22:16.932
It's perpetuating the idea
that we need them

22:16.932 --> 22:20.682
to help us to fix--
Right, right,
and if they wanna help us,

22:20.682 --> 22:22.640
they have
to stop treating us
like we're helpers.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.473
Ollie:
Well, I guess we'll take
Amnesia Haze. Thanks.

22:24.473 --> 22:27.016
I don't have any money.
Brenna, you got cash?

22:27.016 --> 22:29.307
Rachel: Create machines
to jack 'em off.
Ardhi: There is more

22:29.307 --> 22:31.182
than our lives
to procreating.
Woman: Okay.

22:31.182 --> 22:33.141
But not-- we don't all
have to procreate.

22:33.141 --> 22:34.849
No, we don't.
Rachel:
But some of us do.

22:34.849 --> 22:36.515
Some want to.
Yeah.

22:36.515 --> 22:38.265
You sure
you don't want
any more?

22:38.265 --> 22:39.682
I think
we're all right.
All right.

22:39.682 --> 22:42.307
Oh, hey, will you take
a picture of us before you go?

22:42.307 --> 22:44.891
Please?
Cecily: White people and black
people had to come together

22:44.891 --> 22:48.682
for us to end slavery
and Jim Crow.

22:48.682 --> 22:51.682
I don't know why
I'm gesticulating towards--
End Jim Crow?

22:51.682 --> 22:52.849
Cool.

22:52.849 --> 22:55.432
Brenna:
Guys! Picture,
picture, picture!

22:55.432 --> 22:56.974
Quick, quick, quick!
Woman: All right.

22:56.974 --> 22:58.473
All right.
You got this.

22:58.473 --> 23:00.807
I want the pussy-teeth sign.

23:06.182 --> 23:09.807
Oh good,
get that in the shot.
We got it. We got it.

23:09.807 --> 23:11.682
We ready?
Okay.

23:11.682 --> 23:14.390
Cecily: Horizontal?
Yeah, horizontal.

23:14.390 --> 23:16.432
Horizontal?
Yeah.

23:16.432 --> 23:18.182
All right.
Okay, here we go.

23:18.182 --> 23:21.432
And... hey,
there's something--

23:21.432 --> 23:24.265
Women: What?

23:26.265 --> 23:29.390
Oh shit! Oh!

23:29.390 --> 23:31.640
Barry:
Shut up!
Everybody calm down!

23:31.640 --> 23:35.182
Calm down! Calm down.

23:35.182 --> 23:37.849
Calm down!
You gotta get under it
like a pizza.

23:37.849 --> 23:40.057
You gotta get
under it like a pizza.

23:40.057 --> 23:41.765
Yes.
Don't hurt it.

23:41.765 --> 23:44.348
No, you gotta sandwich it.
I am giving him
a platform.

23:44.348 --> 23:46.182
We all deserve
a platform.
Be careful.

23:46.182 --> 23:48.390
We all deserve this.
Holy shit.

23:48.390 --> 23:50.141
Ollie: Don't hurt it.
Barry:
I'm not hurting it.

23:50.141 --> 23:54.057
It-it-- it's soft.
Come on, snake.
Come on, little snake.

23:54.057 --> 23:56.182
Everybody, get down!

23:58.765 --> 24:00.932
Brenna:
Rachel, you brought a gun
in our fucking house?

24:00.932 --> 24:04.016
You guys, I am--
I am handling this.

24:04.016 --> 24:07.849
Rachel, don't you dare
shoot that fucking snake
in my house!

24:07.849 --> 24:10.849
Okay, okay, okay.
It's moving. I'm all good.

24:10.849 --> 24:12.390
Okay, somebody's at the door.

24:12.390 --> 24:15.307
I got it. I got it.

24:15.307 --> 24:18.765
Brenna:
Rachel, my baby is
outside the fucking door.

24:18.765 --> 24:21.640
I'm not shooting Malia.
I'm shooting the snake!

24:21.640 --> 24:24.307
Rachel!
Rachel: Guys, I'm freaking out!
Be quiet!

24:27.765 --> 24:29.765
Mommy.
Hi, baby.

24:29.765 --> 24:32.141
Woman: Hi. Hi.
Hi. Hi.

24:32.141 --> 24:35.057
Hi. So, we've got
a bit of a situation.

24:35.057 --> 24:37.141
It's totally fine.
It's an adult situation.

24:37.141 --> 24:39.849
Could you just go upstairs,
20 minutes--
Do you want me to help you?

24:39.849 --> 24:42.099
Brenna:
Put the gun down, Rachel.
Uh, no.

24:42.099 --> 24:45.099
Absolutely not.
Thank you. We've got it
super under control.

24:45.099 --> 24:47.099
Woman:
Down! Put the gun down!

24:47.099 --> 24:49.515
Rachel:
Please stop yelling at me.

24:49.515 --> 24:52.099
Repeat, "I am not insane,"
and put the gun down.

24:52.099 --> 24:55.099
Okay, okay, I'm sorry!
Stop yelling! I'm sorry.

24:55.099 --> 24:57.432
Okay, okay,
should I drop it?

24:57.432 --> 24:59.599
Shit. Don't drop the gun.
Just put it down.

24:59.599 --> 25:01.974
Woman: On the table.
Okay, putting it--
I'm moving the cheese.

25:01.974 --> 25:04.807
I'm moving the cheese.
I'm putting it down.
I'm putting it down.

25:04.807 --> 25:07.307
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, you guys.
I love you.

25:07.307 --> 25:09.891
It's just--
he seems nice.

25:09.891 --> 25:12.265
You brought a gun
into this house?

25:12.265 --> 25:14.849
All right! Sisters, listen!

25:14.849 --> 25:17.932
We gotta get
this fucking snake
out of the apartment.

25:17.932 --> 25:19.223
Who is with me?

25:19.223 --> 25:21.557
I am with you.
Are you kidding me?
Woman: We're with you.

25:21.557 --> 25:23.682
Cecily:
I am supporting you
from here!

25:23.682 --> 25:25.891
Wait a sec.
I think I know that snake.

25:25.891 --> 25:28.515
Women: What?
I've-- I mean,
I don't know the snake.

25:28.515 --> 25:30.765
I delivered down
the hall to somebody.

25:30.765 --> 25:33.515
I saw the snake.
His name is Fagin.

25:33.515 --> 25:35.515
Or her name is Fagin.
I don't know.

25:35.515 --> 25:39.348
Women:
It's a neighbor's snake.
Fagin. Fagin.

25:39.348 --> 25:41.348
No, no, no, no.
Don't. Don't.

25:41.348 --> 25:43.307
I just don't think
that you should--
You know what?

25:43.307 --> 25:45.348
Everyone shut
the fuck up for a second.

25:45.348 --> 25:48.182
You should pick it up
by both ends to support it.

25:48.182 --> 25:50.099
I'm supporting it.
Barry: You need the butt too.

25:50.099 --> 25:52.307
Pick it up
the right way. Don't--

25:54.265 --> 25:56.557
All right, move! Move!

25:58.182 --> 26:01.432
Move. Move. Move.

26:01.432 --> 26:04.057
Move. Move!

26:04.057 --> 26:07.223
Oh... shit.
It's down the hall.

26:07.223 --> 26:09.223
Okay, all right,
just don't--

26:09.223 --> 26:11.432
Careful. Careful.
All right.

26:11.432 --> 26:14.432
That's not the one.
That's not-- That's not the one.
