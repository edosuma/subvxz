WEBVTT

00:01.334 --> 00:05.237
Hawkeye: All of them.
Every last one.

00:05.772 --> 00:09.208
Inconsiderate, gamma-faced
glutton-head...

00:12.712 --> 00:15.114
(woman screams)

00:18.451 --> 00:20.019
(woman screams on tv)

00:20.487 --> 00:22.554
Next time, knock.
What do you want?

00:22.556 --> 00:24.156
What do I want?

00:24.290 --> 00:25.524
I wanted pickles!

00:28.428 --> 00:31.030
Now? I just want
some answers.

00:31.264 --> 00:32.497
(woman screams on tv)

00:35.068 --> 00:38.103
Can only deal with one
girly scream at a time.

00:39.105 --> 00:40.172
(in high pitched voice) girly?

00:41.108 --> 00:44.510
You overgrown
garbage disposal!

00:45.078 --> 00:46.278
How do you know it was me?

00:46.646 --> 00:48.113
Aw, come on!

00:51.484 --> 00:53.485
(burps)
(sniffs)

00:54.120 --> 00:55.254
There it is.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.389
Pickle juice.
I can smell it.

00:57.391 --> 01:00.192
(scoffs) big mouth
for a small head.

01:00.693 --> 01:02.628
Fine, yeah, I ate
your stupid pickles.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.696
(groans)
cry about it outside.

01:12.739 --> 01:16.141
Hey, I remember these.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.811
What are you doing?

01:19.479 --> 01:22.748
Gotta say, there really is
nothing like a little
glass unicorn

01:22.750 --> 01:24.817
To show off your
soft side, hulkie.

01:24.819 --> 01:26.085
(woman screams)

01:26.087 --> 01:27.319
Get away from that!

01:27.321 --> 01:29.455
Get away from what... Ah!

01:29.823 --> 01:31.557
(grunts)

01:31.825 --> 01:33.092
Whoa!

01:35.128 --> 01:36.261
(beeping)

01:37.797 --> 01:40.432
I said back away!

01:41.534 --> 01:43.836
That is it! I've had
enough of your...

01:44.704 --> 01:45.771
Huh?

01:46.272 --> 01:47.639
(rumbling)

01:48.341 --> 01:49.775
(glass shatters)
(groans)

01:49.777 --> 01:52.644
(echoing) scabby!

01:56.816 --> 01:58.784
(whimpers)

01:59.720 --> 02:03.388
(chuckles nervously)
you know what?
Just forget the pickles.

02:04.157 --> 02:05.424

02:25.412 --> 02:26.678
(roaring)

02:27.680 --> 02:30.249
Ugh. Again?

02:30.251 --> 02:32.284
Your turn,
captain hall monitor.

02:33.419 --> 02:34.920
(panting)

02:35.288 --> 02:36.355
(grunts)

02:36.856 --> 02:37.923
(shrieks)

02:38.725 --> 02:39.825
Come on, give me a break!

02:40.326 --> 02:42.161
Stop moving, and I will!

02:46.766 --> 02:47.866
(growls)

02:47.868 --> 02:50.269
All right, look,
you jade temper tantrum,

02:50.271 --> 02:51.737
This was totally your fault.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.939
Your arrow. Your bad.

02:56.609 --> 02:59.211
Hulk, hawkeye... Do you
know what time it is?

02:59.446 --> 03:04.583
He's bent out of shape
over one of his stupid
glass animals that fell.

03:04.884 --> 03:06.385
You... You didn't...

03:06.686 --> 03:09.188
Hawkeye, did you
mess with the zoo?

03:09.322 --> 03:11.223
No. The zoo?

03:11.558 --> 03:12.858
You got a death
wish, hawkeye?

03:13.326 --> 03:15.527
Me? What about
the pickles?

03:15.828 --> 03:17.529
(annunciating) pickles!

03:19.199 --> 03:21.700
Alien 1: Are you
recording this?
Alien 2: Indeed.

03:21.901 --> 03:23.235
He's every bit as savage

03:23.237 --> 03:24.870
As mojo said he would be.

03:25.572 --> 03:28.640
<i>Have we found</i>
<i>my star attraction?</i>

03:28.942 --> 03:30.375
Alien 1: He is occupied.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.945
Engaged in a...
What is the word?

03:33.379 --> 03:34.780
"stand-off"?

03:34.782 --> 03:37.816
<i>Oh, of course.</i>
<i>A classic.</i>

03:37.818 --> 03:40.352
<i>Like an american cowboy.</i>

03:40.620 --> 03:42.554
<i>Now, be good underlings</i>

03:42.556 --> 03:43.956
<i>And bring me the hulk.</i>

03:45.225 --> 03:47.893
Accidents happen, hulk.
I'm sure hawkeye
feels bad about it.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.962
I like watching him shake.

03:50.797 --> 03:53.365
Take a step.
I dare you.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.601
I wouldn't do that.
He didn't mean it, hulk.

03:55.603 --> 03:56.768
Dare me?

03:56.770 --> 03:58.270
Hulk: You dare me?

03:58.571 --> 03:59.771
Stand down, hulk.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.406
(growls)

04:03.276 --> 04:05.744
Hawkeye: Whoa!
Hulk: Bet you're sorry now!

04:06.346 --> 04:09.881
Now? Now I'm glad
your glass doll is broken.

04:09.883 --> 04:10.983
Doll?

04:11.651 --> 04:12.951
Enough's enough, guys.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.920
This is embarrassing.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.521
Alien 1: I can't
get a clear shot.

04:16.523 --> 04:17.856
Take 'em both.

04:18.358 --> 04:19.757
(whirring)

04:20.026 --> 04:22.327
No, let him sweat, tin...

04:24.330 --> 04:26.265
Oh, that's just great.

04:26.633 --> 04:27.699
Now what?

04:32.805 --> 04:34.306
(hulk grunts)

04:34.308 --> 04:37.909
Get off me, you rage-filled,
crystal-collecting...

04:38.778 --> 04:40.779
Uh, hulk?

04:41.347 --> 04:43.682
I don't think we landed
in a new york street.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.550
Alien 2: This isn't right.

04:45.552 --> 04:46.952
Ah, I see.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.921
We have received a parasitic
life-form in error.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.757
A bonus indeed.

05:04.504 --> 05:06.938
Mojo:  <i>Ladies,</i>
<i>gentlemen, others.</i>

05:06.940 --> 05:09.408
<i>Look what I've brought you.</i>

05:12.345 --> 05:14.513
Wait... "special guest"?

05:16.916 --> 05:17.983
(grunts)

05:19.686 --> 05:21.019
(cameras clicking)

05:22.021 --> 05:23.689
(yelling) whoa!

05:23.823 --> 05:24.890
(grunts)

05:25.758 --> 05:28.393
A gladiatorial arena?

05:28.895 --> 05:31.863
Can't I ever be transported
to some island paradise?

05:31.865 --> 05:33.465
Or a ski slope? Or...

05:33.467 --> 05:34.933
(monster roars)

05:34.935 --> 05:36.001
(audience cheering)

05:40.406 --> 05:42.374
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Down, boy! Down, boy!

05:42.376 --> 05:44.376
Whoa! Hey!

05:44.378 --> 05:46.778
A little help here, hulk?
(monster screeches)

05:46.780 --> 05:48.814
Mojo:  <i>From arena 6c,</i>

05:48.816 --> 05:52.851
<i>Aboard the mojo</i>
<i>ensign class warp-ship,</i>

05:52.853 --> 05:55.887

05:59.593 --> 06:04.429

<i>And a human</i>
<i>hitch-hiking parasite</i>
<i>that shoots sharp sticks!</i>

06:10.670 --> 06:12.137
<i>This guy!</i>

06:12.139 --> 06:13.605
<i>And finally,</i>

06:13.607 --> 06:17.409
Reigning mojo-pocalypse
champion,

06:17.577 --> 06:19.845
<i>Torgo!</i>

06:19.847 --> 06:21.646
What are you waiting
for, hulk?

06:21.648 --> 06:22.848
An apology.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.750
Apologize? To you?

06:24.752 --> 06:26.718
You threw me out a window!

06:27.820 --> 06:28.887
Huh.

06:33.826 --> 06:35.060
Happy?
(panting)

06:40.833 --> 06:41.900
Hulk?

06:56.649 --> 06:58.450
Mojo:  <i>The mighty... Nay,</i>

06:58.452 --> 07:00.752
<i>The indestructible hulk</i>

07:00.754 --> 07:02.954
<i>Felled by a single punch?</i>

07:02.956 --> 07:05.056
<i>Now that's good cookin'.</i>

07:05.425 --> 07:06.858
<i>Let's hear it for him.</i>

07:06.860 --> 07:08.827
<i>Torgo!</i>

07:08.829 --> 07:12.831
(cheering)

07:12.833 --> 07:13.899
(chanting) torgo! Torgo!

07:19.138 --> 07:21.740
<i>Now let's see how this, uh,</i>

07:21.742 --> 07:24.209
Hand-picked human place holder

07:24.211 --> 07:27.879
<i>Fares against your</i>
<i>10-time tournament champion</i>

07:27.881 --> 07:30.115
<i>And all-around crusher.</i>

07:31.185 --> 07:36.087
Mojo:  <i>Who gives you the best</i>
<i>in cosmic entertainment?</i>

07:36.089 --> 07:37.956
Audience: (chanting)
mojo! Mojo!

07:37.958 --> 07:42.928
<i>I can't hear you!</i>

07:43.830 --> 07:45.063
(audience cheering)
torgo make quick.

07:45.932 --> 07:47.966
Not the kind of
pickle I wanted.

07:50.236 --> 07:52.037
Torgo make bang-bang!

07:54.040 --> 07:55.807
Not on hawkeye, he doesn't.

07:55.809 --> 07:56.875
(groans)

08:00.613 --> 08:01.947
Who's in charge here?

08:01.949 --> 08:04.082
Mojo: I sent you to earth,

08:04.484 --> 08:07.185
The most unruly planet
in the galaxy,

08:07.187 --> 08:08.987
And this is what I get?

08:08.989 --> 08:11.890
Torgo needs
a worthy challenger!

08:11.892 --> 08:14.559
Who's this
yellow-haired flesh bag?

08:14.561 --> 08:16.928
He's messing with my show.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.964
Teleport green meanie

08:18.966 --> 08:20.966
Back in there
before I fall asleep

08:20.968 --> 08:22.968
Watching this yawn-fest.

08:23.102 --> 08:26.004
And bring me
seven buckets of krill.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.006
Mojo hungers. Go!

08:37.015 --> 08:38.216
(groans)

08:40.019 --> 08:42.687
<i>And look who's back</i>
<i>wanting more!</i>

08:42.688 --> 08:45.857
<i>The inescapable hulk.</i>

08:45.859 --> 08:47.225
(powering up)

08:48.961 --> 08:51.730
We're on the verge
of a nasty comeback,

08:51.732 --> 08:56.167
And I can only get
5.2 billion to watch?

08:56.636 --> 08:59.538
It's the sports event
of a lifetime.

08:59.540 --> 09:02.741
The whole universe
should be tuned in!

09:03.543 --> 09:04.609
(grunts)

09:04.611 --> 09:06.044
Here's metal in your eye!

09:09.015 --> 09:10.015
(grunts)

09:15.655 --> 09:17.956
Torgo bless you with one...

09:18.257 --> 09:19.558
Two!

09:19.560 --> 09:21.192
Torgo smash!

09:21.194 --> 09:22.727
Hulk: That's my line!

09:24.697 --> 09:25.997
(grunts)

09:27.066 --> 09:28.800
Huh?

09:29.602 --> 09:32.237
(whistles)
nice double, hulk.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.805
Home run.

09:33.807 --> 09:34.940
Mojo: Total knock-out?

09:38.911 --> 09:40.946
(cackles)

09:46.052 --> 09:49.287
Mojo:  <i>Hulk is</i>
<i>the new champion!</i>

09:49.289 --> 09:50.922
(bell dings)

09:52.091 --> 09:53.592
Hate paparazzi.

09:53.594 --> 09:56.628
You may be the champion
of the arena,

09:56.630 --> 10:01.066
But I'm the undefeated
master of public opinion.

10:02.134 --> 10:03.201
(squeals)

10:03.203 --> 10:09.107
What does an audience adore
even more than a champion
or an underdog?

10:11.277 --> 10:14.145
<i>A rematch!</i>

10:16.115 --> 10:17.782
(coughs)

10:21.787 --> 10:22.988

10:29.629 --> 10:33.031
Torgo say night-night,
green-green.

10:37.870 --> 10:40.038
Come on, green-green.
Up and at 'em.

10:42.241 --> 10:44.009
(groans)

10:44.944 --> 10:46.645
What happened?

10:46.647 --> 10:48.713
Torgo made bang-bang.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.049
(growls)

10:51.051 --> 10:52.984
(groaning)

10:54.654 --> 10:57.789
I thought you were mojo's
bff warrior lapdog.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.224
What is this? A trick?

10:59.226 --> 11:01.993
No. Torgo prisoner, like you.

11:01.995 --> 11:05.030

11:21.248 --> 11:23.982
<i>Mojo no cancel torgo home.</i>

11:24.884 --> 11:26.117
Cancel home?

11:26.318 --> 11:28.119
What do you mean,
destroy your planet?

11:28.320 --> 11:30.989
Yeah. Great boom-boom.

11:31.457 --> 11:33.258
This torgo's story.

11:33.759 --> 11:35.860
This torgo's apology.

11:36.262 --> 11:38.930
You're apologizing?
To us?

11:38.932 --> 11:41.132
Well, there's something
I don't hear every day.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.034
Haven't forgotten
about you.

11:43.036 --> 11:47.172
Oh, so we're back to our
regularly-scheduled program?

11:47.306 --> 11:50.975
Don't worry, pickle puss.
You'll be back to your old
doll collection shortly.

11:51.277 --> 11:54.245
Not doll! Don't call it doll.

11:54.814 --> 11:56.715
Humans. (sighs)

11:56.717 --> 11:57.982
Doomed.

11:59.985 --> 12:01.352
Audience: (chanting)
mojo! Mojo!

12:03.923 --> 12:06.257
<i>Thank you! Thank...</i>

12:06.259 --> 12:07.325
<i>Silence!</i>

12:08.027 --> 12:09.994
Can we get on with it?
I'm hungry...

12:12.298 --> 12:13.498

12:13.500 --> 12:14.766

12:32.018 --> 12:33.918
They're not here for you.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.487
(audience cheers)

12:37.990 --> 12:40.859
What? I got charisma.

12:45.965 --> 12:47.499
(cheering)

12:49.301 --> 12:51.035
(cameras clicking)

12:52.805 --> 12:53.872
(roars)

12:57.777 --> 12:58.910
(roars)

12:58.912 --> 13:00.445
Mojo:  <i>Derby of demise!</i>

13:01.147 --> 13:02.280
Round two.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.915
No, no, no.
Hold up, hulk!

13:03.917 --> 13:05.216
Torgo's not
the bad guy here.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.018
Wait it out and try...
(both groaning)

13:07.020 --> 13:08.453
(all groan)

13:09.889 --> 13:12.423
That's right, sports fans!

13:12.792 --> 13:14.959
We've got ourselves
a good old

13:14.961 --> 13:16.427
"derby of demise."

13:18.364 --> 13:20.298
The rules are simple.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.966
<i>There are none!</i>

13:21.968 --> 13:25.203
<i>The last alien</i>
<i>standing lives.</i>

13:25.404 --> 13:27.071
What are we dealing
with, torgo?

13:27.073 --> 13:29.107
Fight. Fight all.

13:29.109 --> 13:30.842
Win for home.

13:31.076 --> 13:32.343
Torgo sorry.

13:36.415 --> 13:38.449
Can I fight him now?

13:38.451 --> 13:40.084
Uh, okay.

13:40.853 --> 13:43.021
Anything you wanna
say to me before
whatever happens here?

13:43.222 --> 13:44.823
No. You?

13:44.825 --> 13:46.858
You are really stubborn,
you know that?

13:47.059 --> 13:48.126
(monster shrieking)
uh...

13:48.961 --> 13:50.261
And angry!

13:50.462 --> 13:52.130
I like when you're angry.

13:53.065 --> 13:54.232
Let's get this over with.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.600
(warrior roars)

13:56.135 --> 13:57.202
(grunts)

13:58.137 --> 14:00.038
(hulk roars)

14:00.940 --> 14:02.006
(grunts)

14:03.008 --> 14:04.075
(snarls)

14:06.445 --> 14:07.979
(grunts)
(growls)

14:11.984 --> 14:13.051
(hulk growls)

14:13.519 --> 14:14.586
(grunts)

14:25.097 --> 14:26.264
Whoa!

14:34.273 --> 14:35.340
(cackles)

14:37.042 --> 14:39.244
Mojo:  <i>Yes! Rocket punch!</i>

14:39.246 --> 14:40.478
(cheering)

14:44.049 --> 14:45.617
(torgo grunts)

14:51.123 --> 14:52.891
(cheering wildly)

14:53.959 --> 14:55.026
Good fight.

14:58.330 --> 15:00.098
(yelling)

15:01.000 --> 15:02.600
(cackles)

15:04.570 --> 15:06.304
Now torgo bless...

15:06.306 --> 15:07.438
Huh?

15:09.074 --> 15:10.241
Huh?

15:14.413 --> 15:15.580
(groans)

15:15.582 --> 15:17.982
(all gasp and groan)

15:20.185 --> 15:22.353
Hawkeye: Sorry, torgo.
Hulk's a pal.

15:23.289 --> 15:24.956
I'll be okay.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.625
Stop mojo. Win.

15:28.528 --> 15:32.964
<i>There are still two</i>
<i>combatants standing.</i>

15:32.966 --> 15:34.933
Us? Versus each other?

15:35.167 --> 15:36.567
Forget it, mojo.

15:36.702 --> 15:38.469
We only fight
over pickles.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.705
They want to flex
their muscle.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.041
I'll flex mine.

15:43.208 --> 15:45.076
<i>You forfeit?</i>

15:45.078 --> 15:46.577
Sick of all your games

15:46.946 --> 15:48.513
And all your chins.

15:48.515 --> 15:49.580
Good one.

15:49.582 --> 15:54.018
<i>I've decided not to renew</i>
<i>your contract, gentlemen.</i>

15:54.020 --> 15:56.054
<i>You've been canceled.</i>

15:56.488 --> 15:58.089
<i>Ta-ta for now.</i>

15:58.657 --> 16:00.024
Wait!

16:02.328 --> 16:03.594
(hawkeye screams)

16:07.499 --> 16:09.467
Wait, before you... (groans)

16:10.469 --> 16:13.004
And where did you
two go, exactly?

16:15.441 --> 16:17.008
Hawkeye: Wherever it was,

16:17.010 --> 16:18.476
It just came here.

16:21.413 --> 16:22.480
(aliens screeching)

16:24.116 --> 16:25.717
What is this?

16:26.051 --> 16:28.019
Oh, an intergalactic
fight promoter

16:28.021 --> 16:29.153
Who wants to destroy
the planet.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.722
You know, the usual.

16:35.561 --> 16:37.395
(creatures shrieking)

16:37.763 --> 16:40.098
Now this is my
kind of sport!

16:43.035 --> 16:45.003
Have at thee, monsters!

16:50.275 --> 16:51.342
(grunts)

16:51.510 --> 16:53.544
We all know mine's
good, but hey, hulk,

16:53.679 --> 16:55.079
How's your aim?

16:58.584 --> 17:00.318
Actually, on second thought,

17:00.652 --> 17:02.520
This may be a really bad idea.

17:02.755 --> 17:06.023
Nah. Best idea
you've had all day.

17:06.525 --> 17:09.093
Hey, I'm sorry for
eating your pickles.

17:09.661 --> 17:12.030
Thank you! I'm sorry too...

17:12.031 --> 17:14.132
Wait, why are you
saying this now?

17:14.134 --> 17:15.233
Just in case.

17:15.234 --> 17:16.401
(hawkeye yells)

17:19.738 --> 17:21.772
(grunts) hulk!

17:22.141 --> 17:23.340
See you inside!

17:30.149 --> 17:32.717
Mojo:  <i>Tonight!</i>
<i>Torgo the tenacious</i>

17:32.719 --> 17:34.352
<i>Takes on not one,</i>

17:34.354 --> 17:37.088
<i>But six of</i>
<i>the nastiest brawlers</i>

17:37.090 --> 17:39.090
<i>That planet earth</i>
<i>has to offer!</i>

17:39.591 --> 17:43.361
<i>Including the rematch</i>
<i>you've all been</i>
<i>waiting for...</i>

17:43.363 --> 17:45.463
<i>The hulk!</i>

17:45.731 --> 17:47.799
<i>Clash of the brash!</i>

17:49.068 --> 17:51.636
Available now on pay-for-view.
Only 70 billion fractin.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.704
I am awesome!

17:54.206 --> 17:56.607
But can you do something
about that fourth chin?

17:57.109 --> 17:58.476
(hulk roars)

18:02.081 --> 18:05.083
Never let it be said
you don't know
how to make an entrance.

18:05.451 --> 18:09.120
(screeching)
underlings!
How dare you run?

18:09.421 --> 18:12.590
I swear, people have
no work ethic these days.

18:14.293 --> 18:17.462
But why beat on me when
you can get beaten on?

18:20.666 --> 18:23.768
Torgo, make bang-bang!

18:27.239 --> 18:28.406
(mojo squeals)

18:28.408 --> 18:30.174
Torgo had enough.

18:30.176 --> 18:31.742
(mojo screams)

18:34.880 --> 18:36.714
(torgo groans)

18:38.250 --> 18:40.585
So many cancellations today.

18:41.520 --> 18:42.653
(hulk groans)

18:44.623 --> 18:47.792
Guess I'll have to find
a new fall lineup.

18:47.794 --> 18:48.893
(hawkeye grunts)

18:52.499 --> 18:58.169
You're just not popular
enough to star in
your own vehicle, uh...

18:58.171 --> 18:59.370
What's your name?
(arrow whizzes)

19:00.772 --> 19:01.873
(crashing)

19:01.875 --> 19:03.774
The name's hawkeye.

19:03.776 --> 19:07.211
This is the part
where you come quietly,
wire-for-brains.

19:07.446 --> 19:09.580
Or what? More violence?

19:09.748 --> 19:11.916
You earthers love to fight.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.918
Over every trivial thing!

19:13.920 --> 19:15.920
"hulk ate my green crunchies!"

19:15.922 --> 19:18.789
"stick-shooter broke
my crystal animal!"

19:18.791 --> 19:21.359
Everything is a fight!

19:21.493 --> 19:23.794
And I'm the bad guy?

19:25.931 --> 19:27.665
(hawkeye yells)

19:28.734 --> 19:29.901
(hawkeye grunts)

19:30.802 --> 19:32.603
Thanks for
having my back.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.239
Enough talk. More smash.

19:38.510 --> 19:39.911
You gotta be kidding.

19:39.913 --> 19:41.779
Talk about a design flaw.

19:41.781 --> 19:44.182
Who puts an exposed
control panel

19:44.184 --> 19:45.917
On the bottom
of their hover chair?

19:45.919 --> 19:47.685
(screams)

19:49.321 --> 19:50.555
Hulk?

19:58.764 --> 20:00.965
(chuckles nervously)

20:02.568 --> 20:04.669
<i>Well, that's our show.</i>

20:04.903 --> 20:06.470
Good fight

20:06.472 --> 20:08.439
And good night, everybody.

20:10.676 --> 20:13.211
Man, I really
hate teleporters.

20:16.682 --> 20:19.717
Torgo: Torgo take ship
and return fighters home.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.919
Then have bounty
placed on mojo.

20:21.921 --> 20:24.889
Time that mojo
go big-boom.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.792
Uh, I like that plan.

20:27.794 --> 20:29.860
Let us know if you need
a hand when you find him.

20:29.862 --> 20:32.230
We avengers love to avenge.

20:33.865 --> 20:36.534
Look, hulk. Mojo said
a lot of dumb stuff,

20:36.536 --> 20:37.969
But one thing made sense.

20:38.337 --> 20:40.404
You and me make mountains
out of molehills, and,

20:41.306 --> 20:43.507
You know, the whole thing with
the crystal in your room.

20:43.509 --> 20:44.709
All of that?

20:44.910 --> 20:45.977
I'm sorry.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.946
(grunts) already apologized.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.014
I know. Just...

20:50.482 --> 20:51.949
Wanted it to be sincere.

20:52.317 --> 20:53.384
We're good.

20:53.386 --> 20:54.452
(hawkeye grunts)

20:57.923 --> 20:59.490
(groans)

21:01.226 --> 21:03.394
(yawns) huh? What the...

21:03.795 --> 21:05.997
Now that's what
I'm talking about!

21:05.999 --> 21:07.765
Ah, that big green galoot!

21:07.767 --> 21:08.899
I didn't know
he had it in him.

21:09.334 --> 21:10.935
Perfect, I'm starving.

21:11.737 --> 21:13.371
Empty? (grunts)

21:14.706 --> 21:16.507
Empty. Empty?

21:17.509 --> 21:19.343
(hawkeye growls)

21:22.414 --> 21:23.681
What?

21:25.851 --> 21:28.819
"I.O.U. 15 boxes of pickles.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.288
"got hungry."

21:30.856 --> 21:32.023
Hawkeye: (screams) hulk!
