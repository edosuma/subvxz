but, uh, you know, when she--

53:24.367 --> 53:26.703
I was blessed with Rachel, so...

53:28.163 --> 53:30.957
[chuckles]
She'd be proud.

53:31.041 --> 53:32.834
Uh, enough about me.

53:32.918 --> 53:34.878
What's up with you, though?
No ring?

53:34.961 --> 53:37.047
Walking around
good and pregnant.

53:37.130 --> 53:40.675
I saw you yesterday
at the--the Farmhouse.

53:40.759 --> 53:44.220
I called your name,
but you must have not heard me.

53:44.304 --> 53:49.601
I must have--I go deaf sometimes
when I shop, so...

53:49.684 --> 53:51.811
Okay. [chuckles]

53:51.895 --> 53:55.398
It almost seemed
like your name wasn't Kate.

53:55.482 --> 53:57.442
Well, it is.

53:57.525 --> 53:58.735
Okay.

54:00.028 --> 54:01.821
I mean, it's okay if it isn't...

54:03.573 --> 54:04.741
you know?

54:05.742 --> 54:07.327
I won't tell.

54:12.165 --> 54:13.792
Is it Laquanda?

54:15.418 --> 54:16.711

54:16.795 --> 54:19.214
Hanging out with Chelsea too long.

54:22.550 --> 54:24.344
Why did you change it?

54:28.932 --> 54:31.726
I married the wrong man.

54:32.018 --> 54:34.938
He was abusive...

54:35.021 --> 54:37.732
mentally, physically.

54:39.859 --> 54:42.529
He was the perfect guy until...

54:43.697 --> 54:45.407
one day, he wasn't.

54:45.490 --> 54:46.700
Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't--

54:46.783 --> 54:49.744
-You don't have to talk about this.
-No, it's okay.

54:49.828 --> 54:53.581
Like you said,
good to talk about it, right?

54:57.711 --> 54:59.170
It just came out of nowhere.

54:59.254 --> 55:00.588
He just snapped.

55:01.965 --> 55:06.553
It was like I never knew him,
like I married a stranger.

55:08.513 --> 55:12.308
I asked myself
how could this man

55:12.392 --> 55:15.895
ever put his hands on the woman
he said he loved so much?

55:15.979 --> 55:16.980
Hmm.

55:19.566 --> 55:21.943
God, those nightmares,
those memories,

55:22.027 --> 55:24.654
they still haunt me,
nightmares, you know.

55:27.741 --> 55:29.242
I'm sorry.

55:33.621 --> 55:35.331
I'm sorry.

55:45.425 --> 55:47.052
Just stop.

55:47.135 --> 55:48.595
What?

55:50.889 --> 55:53.683
Stop staring at me.

55:56.686 --> 55:58.605
I can't help it.

56:04.027 --> 56:05.153
I'm sorry.

-Uh, I'm sorry.
-I am sorry.

56:06.988 --> 56:08.490
-No, it's okay.
-I'm sorry. I can't--

56:08.573 --> 56:09.866
-That was--
-I just--

56:09.949 --> 56:11.284
-I get it. I know.
-Okay.

56:11.367 --> 56:13.703
I didn't--
Do you want me to get the--

56:13.787 --> 56:15.371
-No, it's okay. Okay.
-Okay.

56:16.372 --> 56:19.626
I-I'm sorry.

Mr. Roland, you have a call,
line one.

56:31.971 --> 56:33.640
Uh, could you take a message,
please?

56:33.723 --> 56:36.309
They said it's regarding your wife.

Okay. Thank you.

56:39.813 --> 56:41.189
This is Mr. Roland.

56:41.272 --> 56:43.024
Hello, Mr. Roland.
This is Brenda Walsh

56:43.108 --> 56:45.235
in the Finance Department
over at McKinley Medical.

56:45.318 --> 56:47.821
I'm trying to reach your wife,
Madison.

56:47.904 --> 56:49.906
She never picked up
her last paycheck,

56:49.989 --> 56:51.324
and we've been trying to reach her,

56:51.407 --> 56:54.077
but the number we have on file for her
seems to have changed.

56:54.160 --> 56:56.621
Um, I'm--I'm sorry.

56:56.704 --> 56:58.665
I don't know what you're--
what you're talking about.

56:58.748 --> 57:00.041
Paycheck?

57:00.125 --> 57:02.252
It's her final paycheck.

57:02.335 --> 57:04.587
When she quit a few months ago,
she never collected it.

57:04.671 --> 57:08.049
Huh. There must be
some kind of mistake.

57:08.133 --> 57:10.844
My wife never worked
at your hospital, ma'am.

57:10.927 --> 57:12.846
Her best friend Chelsea did.

57:12.929 --> 57:14.514
Maybe you have them confused?

57:14.597 --> 57:16.474
I'm sure she did.

57:16.558 --> 57:20.228
Uh, says here in our records
that your wife worked mornings

57:20.311 --> 57:22.814
two days a week,
Wednesdays and Thursdays.

57:22.897 --> 57:26.067
There's a mistake. My wife
would go for her morning runs

57:26.151 --> 57:28.486
on Wednesdays
and Thursday mornings.

57:28.570 --> 57:31.072
That is so strange.
It clearly says

57:31.156 --> 57:33.199
that Madison Roland
was an employee.

57:34.742 --> 57:37.203
Okay.
I don't know what's going on,

57:37.287 --> 57:40.206
but my wife won't be picking up
any paychecks anytime soon.

57:40.290 --> 57:42.125
She died a few months ago.

57:42.208 --> 57:44.919
Um, are you new to the hospital?

57:45.003 --> 57:49.090
No, sir. I-I'm not.
I've been here 10 years. Why?

57:49.174 --> 57:50.925
Well, she died in your hospital,

57:51.009 --> 57:53.511
and I would think that you would
have record of that on file.

57:53.595 --> 57:55.680
Hold on, Mr. Roland.

58:00.560 --> 58:03.521
Okay, I do have here in our database

58:03.605 --> 58:06.107
that Madison Roland was admitted
into the emergency room

58:06.191 --> 58:10.570
at 10:45 p.m., March 21,
due to a car accident.

58:12.071 --> 58:13.781
That is so strange.

58:13.865 --> 58:17.035
It doesn't have her time of death.

58:17.118 --> 58:21.831
It says that she was checked out
that same night at 11:37 p.m.

58:38.306 --> 58:41.559
[over P.A.]
Dr. Forrest, dial 118 please?

58:41.643 --> 58:43.686
Dr. Forrest, please dial--

58:43.770 --> 58:46.064
Excuse me. I'm looking
for a Dr. Foster, please?

58:46.147 --> 58:48.399
I apologize, sir.
We don't have a Dr. Foster here.

58:48.483 --> 58:50.818
Uh, can you check?
I'm sure I've seen him here before.

58:50.902 --> 58:52.654
Sir, it's my job
to know all the doctors here.

58:52.737 --> 58:55.198
I would know if there was a Dr. Foster,
which we don't.

58:55.281 --> 58:58.785
Okay. I'm sure you're quite capable,
but can you please check?

58:58.868 --> 59:01.412
Maybe he's on a different wing or side
or whatever you guys say.

59:01.496 --> 59:02.914
Maybe you're at the wrong hospital.

59:02.997 --> 59:05.458
There's actually another hospital
couple blocks from here.

-Oh, she was?

a copy of her records.

Uh, she's pregnant.
I need 'em for her new doctor.

59:28.690 --> 59:30.066

some I.D., please?

I'm still healing.

1:06:06.754 --> 1:06:08.255
[laughs]

1:06:08.339 --> 1:06:11.092
Uh, what do you say we just
take it one step at a time?

1:06:11.175 --> 1:06:12.593
Yeah. Yes. I'd like that.

1:06:12.677 --> 1:06:13.761
Cool. All right. Me, too.

1:06:13.844 --> 1:06:15.054
I'm glad we're still talking,

1:06:15.137 --> 1:06:17.932
'cause, uh,
Rachel misses you so.

1:06:18.015 --> 1:06:19.225
It's good.

1:06:19.308 --> 1:06:20.768
You're gonna put this on Rachel?

1:06:20.851 --> 1:06:23.854
-Say what?
-You didn't miss me?

1:06:23.938 --> 1:06:25.272
No. It's only been a day,

1:06:25.356 --> 1:06:26.941
-so I don't know--
-Little bit?

1:06:27.024 --> 1:06:28.401
-No, no.
-Okay.

1:06:28.484 --> 1:06:29.944
-A little bit.
-[both laugh]

1:06:30.027 --> 1:06:31.362
-Thank you.
-I did.

1:06:31.445 --> 1:06:32.488
All right, cool.

1:06:32.571 --> 1:06:34.657
-Good talk. Good talk.
-Yes.

1:06:34.740 --> 1:06:36.325
-Thank you.
-All right. [laughs]

1:06:36.409 --> 1:06:39.704
-Back to work, busy man.
-Yes, watering the lawn.

1:06:39.787 --> 1:06:41.539
-[Madison laughing]
-[Alex groans]

1:06:44.125 --> 1:06:47.294
[Rob] And what even makes you
think she's still alive?

1:06:47.378 --> 1:06:50.089
Well, I got a call from the hospital

1:06:50.172 --> 1:06:54.552
saying that she had failed
to pick up her last paycheck,

1:06:55.136 --> 1:07:00.558
and when I pressed them on it,
they said she was checked in,

1:07:00.641 --> 1:07:02.893
and then she was checked out.

1:07:02.977 --> 1:07:05.479
They didn't have
any record of her dying.

1:07:05.563 --> 1:07:07.189
But you did see the body, right?

1:07:07.273 --> 1:07:12.111
Well, from a distance, yeah.

1:07:12.194 --> 1:07:13.738
I mean, Rob,
you gotta understand, man.

1:07:13.821 --> 1:07:15.322
I was devastated.

1:07:15.406 --> 1:07:18.075
The love of my life,
my unborn child, both dead.

1:07:18.951 --> 1:07:20.494
It was hard, man. I--

1:07:21.704 --> 1:07:22.913
I had her cremated.

1:07:22.997 --> 1:07:26.083
Well, then, if she was cremated,
then you know she's not alive.

1:07:31.505 --> 1:07:33.716
-Chelsea.
-What?

1:07:33.799 --> 1:07:35.593
Like I said,
it was hard on me,

1:07:35.676 --> 1:07:38.596
so I had her best friend
Chelsea handle everything...

1:07:39.847 --> 1:07:41.849
including the cremation.

1:07:44.393 --> 1:07:47.480
What you're telling me
is that you aren't sure

1:07:47.563 --> 1:07:50.066
that she was actually cremated?

1:07:50.149 --> 1:07:52.985
Now, I can go this thing alone,
or I can get my guys on it,

1:07:53.069 --> 1:07:54.779
but it's gonna cost you
a lot of money.

1:07:56.989 --> 1:07:59.909
Money's not an issue, man.
Find her.

1:07:59.992 --> 1:08:01.160
All right. In the meantime,

1:08:01.243 --> 1:08:02.787
you need to get some help, brother.

1:08:09.085 --> 1:08:11.045
Long time, no see.

1:08:11.128 --> 1:08:12.129
Hey.

1:08:13.547 --> 1:08:15.299
It--It has been a minute.

1:08:16.509 --> 1:08:18.010
How are you?

1:08:18.094 --> 1:08:20.888
Ah, I'm okay, you know.

1:08:20.971 --> 1:08:23.474
Just taking it one day at a time.

1:08:25.559 --> 1:08:27.103
So come here. Come here.

1:08:31.232 --> 1:08:32.858
I know. It's been--

1:08:32.942 --> 1:08:36.654
It's been--
It's been hard, you know?

1:08:36.737 --> 1:08:41.033
I, um, I can't believe
I lost my best friend.

1:08:44.495 --> 1:08:47.665
So to what do I owe this pleasure?

1:08:47.748 --> 1:08:52.378
Uh, just wanna let you know
I'm selling the house.

1:08:52.461 --> 1:08:53.963
Uh, it would really mean a lot

1:08:54.046 --> 1:08:56.966
if you came by and helped
with Madison's things,

1:08:57.049 --> 1:08:58.300
if you want to.

1:08:58.384 --> 1:09:00.386
Yeah, sure.

1:09:00.469 --> 1:09:02.221
Sure. Just let me know when.

1:09:02.304 --> 1:09:04.181
Well, maybe tomorrow
you can come by,

1:09:04.265 --> 1:09:05.724
if you're not too busy.

1:09:05.808 --> 1:09:07.434
Okay, cool.

1:09:07.518 --> 1:09:09.061
All right. See you then.

1:09:10.020 --> 1:09:11.647
Michael.

1:09:11.730 --> 1:09:15.234
It's--It's really good
to see you doing good.

1:09:43.512 --> 1:09:44.972
[overlapping chatter]

1:09:45.055 --> 1:09:47.808
I like when you guys
work together.

1:09:47.892 --> 1:09:49.393
-You want another color?
-Yeah.

1:09:49.476 --> 1:09:51.228
-What about this one?
-Yeah, that's so pretty.

1:09:51.312 --> 1:09:54.523
-Yeah.
-[cellphone buzzing]

1:09:54.607 --> 1:09:57.026
I'm happy you came today.

1:09:57.109 --> 1:09:58.319
Ohh.

1:09:58.402 --> 1:10:01.030
My daddy really likes you.

1:10:01.113 --> 1:10:04.617
He does? Guess what?

1:10:04.700 --> 1:10:06.368
I really like your dad.

1:10:06.660 --> 1:10:07.828
And you, too.

1:10:08.537 --> 1:10:10.414
Can I tell you a secret?

1:10:10.497 --> 1:10:13.292
Of course.
You can tell me anything.

1:10:13.375 --> 1:10:15.794
[whispers]
I like you, too.

1:10:15.878 --> 1:10:17.504
You're so cute.

1:10:53.040 --> 1:10:54.458
Excuse me, miss?

1:10:54.541 --> 1:10:56.210
Can I help you?

1:11:01.131 --> 1:11:03.717
I've also followed up on the lead

1:11:03.801 --> 1:11:05.886
of that address that you gave me.

1:11:05.970 --> 1:11:08.305
Yeah, I know. I--I Googled it,

1:11:08.389 --> 1:11:10.849
but I figured that had to be a dead--
dead lead.

1:11:10.933 --> 1:11:12.476
It's a burger stand.
Why would she--

1:11:13.769 --> 1:11:17.606
Yeah, what you don't know
is that a couple of weeks ago,

1:11:17.690 --> 1:11:20.609
a woman started working there
that fits her description.

1:11:20.693 --> 1:11:22.528
My guy has looked into it.

1:11:25.489 --> 1:11:26.657
So we're on it.

1:11:28.033 --> 1:11:29.368
Don't worry about it. I got--

1:11:29.451 --> 1:11:30.995
I'll go look into that.
You don't have--

1:11:31.078 --> 1:11:32.621
No, no, you're not gonna look into it.

1:11:32.705 --> 1:11:34.915
That's what you paid us for, all right?

1:11:34.999 --> 1:11:37.209
Just let me do my job.

1:11:37.293 --> 1:11:41.714
Secondly, have you looked into
some kind of counseling, bro?

1:11:41.797 --> 1:11:44.174
-Yeah, I talked--
-Don't lie to me, man.

1:11:44.258 --> 1:11:46.260
I talked to somebody about it.

1:11:46.343 --> 1:11:48.262
I got that--
I got it under control.

1:11:48.345 --> 1:11:49.847
Don't worry about it.

1:11:53.100 --> 1:11:54.685
[car lock chirps]

1:11:56.103 --> 1:11:57.980
[bushes rustling]

1:12:02.234 --> 1:12:04.278
[bushes rustling]

1:12:07.239 --> 1:12:09.241
[footsteps]

1:12:11.952 --> 1:12:13.245
[screams]

1:12:13.329 --> 1:12:15.581
Whoa, it's just me.
It's just me.

1:12:15.664 --> 1:12:16.957
-Okay.
-You all right?

1:12:17.041 --> 1:12:18.417
Yes. I'm sorry.

1:12:18.500 --> 1:12:20.002
I'm sorry that I startled you.

1:12:20.085 --> 1:12:22.338
Yeah, no, no, no.
I'm fine.

1:12:22.421 --> 1:12:24.757
I just get a little paranoid
sometimes, you know...

1:12:24.840 --> 1:12:26.967
-Yeah.
-me in this house by myself.

1:12:27.051 --> 1:12:30.679
Okay. Well, you know,
you don't have to be.

1:12:30.763 --> 1:12:32.222
What does that mean?

1:12:32.306 --> 1:12:34.391
Alone in this house by yourself.

1:12:34.475 --> 1:12:36.352
Where's Rachel?

1:12:36.435 --> 1:12:38.437
Rachel, she's staying over
at her friend's,

1:12:38.562 --> 1:12:39.855
spending the night.

1:12:39.938 --> 1:12:41.482
Come on.

1:12:45.361 --> 1:12:46.278
Come on.

1:12:46.362 --> 1:12:47.363
[laughs] Okay.

1:12:54.370 --> 1:12:56.580
Damn.

1:12:56.663 --> 1:12:58.999
-[laughs]
-Sorry.

1:12:59.083 --> 1:13:01.293
You are even beautiful
in the morning.

1:13:01.377 --> 1:13:03.045
Oh, stop it.

1:13:03.128 --> 1:13:05.005
[laughs]

1:13:05.089 --> 1:13:06.673
Are you a witch?

1:13:06.757 --> 1:13:10.260
[laughs]
Trying to make me blush?

1:13:10.344 --> 1:13:12.763
Freaks me out a little bit.

1:13:12.846 --> 1:13:14.681
[sighs]

1:13:16.475 --> 1:13:19.478
Thank you...
for staying with me.

1:13:20.521 --> 1:13:23.857
It's been a long time
since I just talked, you know.

1:13:23.941 --> 1:13:25.234
I know, right?

1:13:26.902 --> 1:13:29.405
-Hope I didn't talk your ear off.
-No, you didn't.

1:13:30.697 --> 1:13:34.827
'Cause you fell asleep
in the middle of my last story.

1:13:34.910 --> 1:13:36.328
[laughs] I did?

1:13:36.412 --> 1:13:39.164
Mm-hmm. Yep.

1:13:39.248 --> 1:13:41.250
Oh. That's why--

1:13:41.333 --> 1:13:42.793
I'm sleeping for two, remember?

1:13:42.876 --> 1:13:44.753
It's all good.

1:13:46.130 --> 1:13:47.631
I had fun.

1:13:47.714 --> 1:13:49.174
Me, too.

1:13:50.634 --> 1:13:52.594
Gotta hit the head.
I'll be right back.

1:13:55.431 --> 1:13:56.974
[clears throat]

1:14:02.729 --> 1:14:04.731
[toilet flushing]

1:14:06.775 --> 1:14:07.776
[seat thumps]

1:14:13.031 --> 1:14:15.033
Did you just put the toilet seat down?

1:14:15.117 --> 1:14:17.327
Yeah.
Did I do something wrong?

1:14:18.829 --> 1:14:22.291
No, not at all.

1:14:22.374 --> 1:14:24.585
[chuckles]

1:14:24.668 --> 1:14:28.172
As a matter of fact,
you did everything right.

1:14:30.757 --> 1:14:32.593
Do you--Do you like me?

1:14:32.676 --> 1:14:34.845
I like doughnuts.

1:14:36.346 --> 1:14:37.681
Are you a doughnut?

1:14:37.764 --> 1:14:40.309
-Do you like doughnuts?
-Yes.

1:14:40.392 --> 1:14:42.060
[laughs]

1:14:47.524 --> 1:14:49.485
There you go.

1:14:51.111 --> 1:14:53.655
-Excuse me.
-Hi.

1:14:53.739 --> 1:14:56.825
My name's John.
I'm looking for Madison Roland.

1:14:56.909 --> 1:14:58.744
Madison Roland?

1:14:58.827 --> 1:15:00.537
There's nobody here by that name.

1:15:00.621 --> 1:15:01.997
You sure you're in the right place?

1:15:02.080 --> 1:15:04.917
Uh, yeah, this is the address
I was given.

1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:06.668
Yeah, sorry. No Madison here.

1:15:06.752 --> 1:15:08.795
That's strange.

1:15:08.879 --> 1:15:11.632
I'm her brother.
Our father's in the hospital.

1:15:11.715 --> 1:15:13.467
I just wanted to let her know about it.

1:15:13.550 --> 1:15:16.178
Um, I haven't seen her in years,
but I actually have a picture.

1:15:18.639 --> 1:15:20.140
That's Kate!

1:15:20.224 --> 1:15:21.391
Kate?

1:15:21.475 --> 1:15:23.060
Kate Smith. She works here.

1:15:23.143 --> 1:15:25.312
Kate.

1:15:25.437 --> 1:15:27.564
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

1:15:27.648 --> 1:15:29.441
Well, I'm sorry about your father.

1:15:29.525 --> 1:15:31.443
Uh, you want me
to let her know you came by?

1:15:31.527 --> 1:15:32.861
I didn't catch your name.

1:15:32.945 --> 1:15:34.821
Do you happen to know
where she's staying?

1:15:34.905 --> 1:15:36.448
That, I can't help you with,

1:15:36.532 --> 1:15:39.243
but if you wanna check with
the elementary school down the street,

1:15:39.326 --> 1:15:41.203
her boyfriend teaches down there.

1:15:42.746 --> 1:15:44.915
Want me to write it down for you?

1:15:45.249 --> 1:15:46.583
No.

1:15:49.461 --> 1:15:51.421
So he came to visit you
out of nowhere?

1:15:51.505 --> 1:15:55.384
Yeah, and he wanted me to come
and help him pack your things.

1:15:55.467 --> 1:15:58.804
I don't know. Maybe--
Maybe you should help him,

1:15:58.887 --> 1:16:02.099
'cause we don't wanna give him
any signals that lead to me.

1:16:02.182 --> 1:16:04.893
I don't know. I mean,
it just felt strange, you know.

1:16:04.977 --> 1:16:07.437
I mean, I didn't even know
Michael knew where I lived.

1:16:07.521 --> 1:16:09.189
I mean, that is odd.

1:16:13.610 --> 1:16:15.612
[gasping]

1:16:17.573 --> 1:16:19.324
[groans]

1:16:21.076 --> 1:16:22.703
Oh, my gosh.

1:16:22.786 --> 1:16:24.621
What? What happened?

1:16:24.705 --> 1:16:27.499
I think my water just broke.

1:16:27.583 --> 1:16:29.501
A-Are you sure? Is--

1:16:29.585 --> 1:16:31.545
I think I'm going into labor.

1:16:31.628 --> 1:16:33.714
Right now?
Right now right now?

1:16:33.797 --> 1:16:35.382
Okay, I-I'm coming. I'm coming.

1:16:35.465 --> 1:16:37.342
I have to get my--
Okay, I-I'm coming.

1:16:37.426 --> 1:16:38.343
I'm on my way!

1:16:38.427 --> 1:16:39.553
Okay, hurry.

1:16:41.597 --> 1:16:43.599
[groaning, breathing heavily]

1:16:52.858 --> 1:16:54.818
Alex.

1:16:54.901 --> 1:16:57.362
[music playing]

1:17:03.660 --> 1:17:06.038

1:17:42.366 --> 1:17:44.701
[baby crying]

1:17:57.923 --> 1:17:59.257
[Chelsea] You were amazing.

1:17:59.341 --> 1:18:00.717
[Madison] Oh, thank you.

1:18:00.801 --> 1:18:02.552

I have--
There's an intruder in my house.
