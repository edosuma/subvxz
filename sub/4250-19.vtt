10:09.567 --> 10:11.569
I NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.281
[thunder crashing]

10:19.452 --> 10:21.329
- VICTOR, WE'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

10:21.412 --> 10:22.538
- YOU CAN'T DROP A PIN.

10:22.621 --> 10:23.873
NOT ALL OF US ARE HERE.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.666
DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD
INVESTIGATE THAT?

10:25.750 --> 10:29.545
- ARE YOU TALKING OF LEWIS,
CLARKE, MERCER, AND WILLIAMSON?

10:29.628 --> 10:31.380
- YOU KNOW WE ARE.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.381
- YES.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.468
I'M NOT EXPECTING THEM BACK.

10:35.551 --> 10:36.802
- NOW, GO TO YOUR ROOMS.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.805
- THAT'S IT, THEN.

10:39.889 --> 10:42.683
THEY'RE GONNA KEEP THEM THERE
UNTIL THE ECLIPSE.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.226
- YEAH, WE'VE GOT NO CHOICE.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.729
EXTREME ACTION IS NOW REQUIRED.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.064
AGREED?
- AGREED.

10:48.147 --> 10:48.939
- AGREED.
- AGREED.

10:49.023 --> 10:50.483
- FINE.

10:50.566 --> 10:51.567
WE STOP THE ADULTS
FROM GETTING TO THE CEREMONY.

10:51.650 --> 10:53.235
- TOMORROW MORNING
WE KIDNAP DENBY,

10:53.319 --> 10:55.613
WE KIDNAP SWEET,

10:55.696 --> 10:56.739
AND BEST OF ALL--

10:56.822 --> 11:00.451
- IT IS 10:00.

11:00.534 --> 11:05.081
YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES PRECISELY,

11:05.164 --> 11:12.296
AND THEN I WANT
TO HEAR A PIN DROP.

11:12.380 --> 11:15.424
- WE KIDNAP VICTOR.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.550
[chuckles]

11:17.343 --> 11:20.513
[thunder crashes]

11:21.514 --> 11:23.808
- ANYONE FOR COCOA?

11:23.891 --> 11:25.226
ALWAYS HELPS ME SLEEP.

11:25.309 --> 11:26.769
AND WE ALL NEED
A GOOD NIGHT'S REST

11:26.852 --> 11:28.437
BEFORE ECLIPSE DAY.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.438
- ACTUALLY, MISS,
I APPRECIATE THE HELP,

11:29.522 --> 11:31.857
BUT WE HAVE TO LEAVE.

11:31.941 --> 11:34.693
- OH, BUT WITH THE WEATHER,
IT'S FRIGHTFUL.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.612
I CAN'T LET YOU
GO OUT IN THAT.

11:36.695 --> 11:38.030
- WELL, WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE?

11:38.114 --> 11:41.033
- WELL, YOU COULD STAY HERE
IN THE GUEST ROOMS TONIGHT.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.035
- WHAT?

11:43.119 --> 11:43.702
- TEACHER'S SLEEPOVER.

11:43.786 --> 11:46.455
THAT IS A LITTLE WEIRD.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.542
- THAT'S SO NICE OF YOU
TO PUT YOURSELF OUT, MISS,

11:49.625 --> 11:50.167
TO STOP US LOSING
THE SCHOLARSHIPS.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.336
- THANK YOU.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.505
- I NEED TO GET BACK.

11:54.588 --> 11:56.298
I CAN'T SLEEP
WITHOUT MY, UM--

11:56.382 --> 11:58.259
- BLANKIE.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.762
OH, HE REALLY PANICS WITHOUT IT.

12:01.846 --> 12:04.390
- OH, ALFIE, THAT'S SO CUTE!

12:04.473 --> 12:05.558
- I THOUGHT WE GOT YOU
OFF BLANKIE

12:05.641 --> 12:06.725
WHEN YOU MOVED TO BIG SCHOOL.

12:06.809 --> 12:07.685
- WELL, DON'T WORRY.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.311
VICTOR CAN TAKE CARE OF IT.

12:09.395 --> 12:12.523
- OKAY, THE POINT IS,
THANKS, BUT NO THANKS.

12:12.606 --> 12:13.983
WE NEED TO GO HOME.

12:14.066 --> 12:18.070
- OH, BUT--BUT I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO MAKE COCOA AND LOCK UP.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.406
[thumping]

12:20.489 --> 12:23.576
OH, THOSE BATS.

12:23.659 --> 12:25.870
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THEY WERE RATS.

12:25.953 --> 12:29.165
- RATS, BATS,
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

12:29.248 --> 12:33.127
NUISANCE.

12:33.210 --> 12:34.503
- ALFIE, SHE'S LEFT HER BAG!

12:34.587 --> 12:36.964
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:39.592 --> 12:44.180
PATRICIA, IF YOU BLOW
THIS GRADE FOR US--

12:44.263 --> 12:46.140
- A MESSAGE FROM KT.

12:46.223 --> 12:47.099
[gasps]

12:47.183 --> 12:49.101
WE REALLY HAVE TO GET OUT
OF HERE.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.102
- WHAT'S WRONG?

12:50.186 --> 12:52.354
- ALL FOUR OF US
ARE DESCENDED.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.231
- BLANKIE!

12:54.315 --> 12:57.193
[all screaming]

12:57.276 --> 12:58.402
- [exhales sharply]

12:58.486 --> 13:00.404
[both shouting and laughing]

13:00.488 --> 13:02.198
- IT'S A LITTLE LATE
FOR A RUN, ISN'T IT?

13:02.281 --> 13:03.282
- I HAVE TO THINK
OF SOME WAY TO GET OUT

13:03.365 --> 13:06.035
OF MARA'S ALL-NIGHT
STUDY SESSION.

13:06.118 --> 13:09.246
AND ANYWAY, I AM TOO HAPPY
AND BUZZY TO SLEEP!

13:09.330 --> 13:11.290
- WELL, I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT.
WHY IS THAT?

13:11.373 --> 13:13.334
- I'M SUPPOSED
TO KEEP IT A SECRET,

13:13.417 --> 13:16.212
BUT I AM JUST BUSTING
TO TELL SOMEONE!

13:16.295 --> 13:18.172
- WELL, YOU KNOW
YOU CAN TRUST ME.

13:18.255 --> 13:19.465
- OKAY.

13:19.548 --> 13:21.550
YOU HAVE TO PROMISE NOT
TO SAY A WORD.

13:22.676 --> 13:24.386
I'VE GOT A NEW BOYFRIEND!
- [gasps]

13:24.470 --> 13:26.847
WHO'S THE LUCKY FELLOW?

13:26.931 --> 13:28.641
- WELL, HE'S A LITTLE SHY.

13:28.724 --> 13:31.143
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO SAY ANYTHING.

13:31.227 --> 13:32.937
[door opens]

13:33.020 --> 13:35.064
- SECRET BOYFRIEND, EH?

13:35.147 --> 13:37.399
OKAY, I WON'T ASK YOU
TO NAME NAMES.

13:37.483 --> 13:41.320
- NO, THAT'S PROBABLY
FOR THE BEST.

13:41.403 --> 13:43.239
- JUST TO LET YOU KNOW,
I'VE FINISHED THE SCRIPT

13:43.322 --> 13:45.199
FOR OUR PRESENTATION BY MYSELF.

13:45.282 --> 13:48.494
WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

13:48.577 --> 13:50.788
- THE SCRIPT, IT'S--

13:50.871 --> 13:53.040
WELL, IT'S VERY MATHEMATICAL.

13:53.123 --> 13:54.291
- WELL, DON'T WORRY.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.751
YOU'VE GOT UNTIL TOMORROW
TO LEARN IT.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.795
IT'S ONLY SIMULTANEOUS
DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS.

13:57.878 --> 14:00.214
SIMPLE, REALLY.

14:00.297 --> 14:04.176
- SUDDENLY I'M REALLY TIRED.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.804
[thunder crashing]

14:06.887 --> 14:09.014
- COME ON, ALFIE!
COME ON!

14:09.098 --> 14:10.516
- IT WON'T MOVE.
IT'S STUCK.

14:10.599 --> 14:11.767
- [speaks indistinctly]

14:11.850 --> 14:13.143
- THANK YOU.

14:13.227 --> 14:15.104
MY HOUSE, MY RULES.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.439
WHAT I MEAN TO SAY IS,
I'VE ALREADY LOCKED UP.

14:17.523 --> 14:20.109
NOW, COCOA.

14:20.192 --> 14:20.985
JOIN?

14:21.068 --> 14:22.987
- I'LL DO THE MARSHMALLOWS.

14:29.743 --> 14:32.079
- ALFIE, IF WHAT
FABIAN SAYS IS TRUE,

14:32.162 --> 14:34.748
IF WE CAN'T GET OUT OF HERE,
THEN THEY'VE GOT EVERYTHING

14:34.832 --> 14:38.085
THEY NEED TO DO THE CEREMONY.

14:38.168 --> 14:39.545
[sighs]

14:44.425 --> 14:46.343
- HEY, GUYS.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.304
I PICKED THE PADLOCK
ON THE CELLAR DOOR.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.639
PHASE ONE, COMPLETE.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.433
- IT'S ECLIPSE DAY, EVERYBODY!

14:52.516 --> 14:53.309
YAY!

14:53.392 --> 14:55.561
I'VE MADE A SPECIAL BREAKFAST,

14:55.644 --> 14:59.148
EGGS SUNNY SIDE UP
WITH MOON-SHAPED TOAST, HMM?

14:59.231 --> 15:00.941
- OH, WELL, I MEAN,
WE ARE TOO EXCITED

15:01.025 --> 15:02.109
TO EAT REALLY, TRUDY.

15:02.192 --> 15:03.485
[chuckles]

15:03.569 --> 15:05.487
- I HOPE YOU'VE ALL GOT
YOUR ECLIPSE VIEWERS READY.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.531
- WE MAY BE A LITTLE BUSY.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.116
- DID YOU HEAR THAT, VICTOR?

15:09.199 --> 15:11.493
THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE
THE ECLIPSE.

15:11.577 --> 15:12.328
- REALLY?

15:12.411 --> 15:15.623
WELL, THEIR CHOICE, I SUPPOSE.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.708
SOME WOULD SAY THE MOMENTS
AFTER THE ECLIPSE

15:17.791 --> 15:20.336
ARE EVEN MORE INTERESTING.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.546
- YOU MIGHT BE MISSING IT
YOURSELF, PAL.

15:27.468 --> 15:30.763
- WHAT WAS THAT, BOY?

15:30.846 --> 15:33.015
- NOTHING.
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.434
- COME ON, VICTOR.
LET THEM EAT THEIR BREAKFAST.

15:45.694 --> 15:47.946
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
IT'S NOW OR NEVER.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.240
EVERYONE KNOWS THE PLAN?

15:50.324 --> 15:50.741
- SIBUNA.

15:50.824 --> 15:51.533
- SIBUNA.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.869
- SIBUNA.

15:53.952 --> 15:56.955
- BETTER GET THESE
OVER TO SCHOOL.

15:57.039 --> 16:01.877
AND WE'D BETTER HURRY, BECAUSE
IT'S 93 MILLION MILES AWAY.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.253
SCIENCE JOKE.
I'LL EXPLAIN AS WE GO.

16:03.337 --> 16:06.340
- OKAY.

16:06.423 --> 16:07.549
[grunts]

16:09.343 --> 16:10.636
[bell ringing]

16:10.719 --> 16:12.054
- WHY WON'T IT OPEN?

16:12.137 --> 16:13.555
- BECAUSE SHE'S MADE SURE
THIS ENTIRE PLACE IS LOCKED.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.265
I TOLD YOU THIS HOURS AGO.

16:15.349 --> 16:17.476
- OKAY.

16:17.559 --> 16:18.644
OKAY, IF IT DOESN'T OPEN,
THEN PLAN "B."

16:18.727 --> 16:20.854
WHY DON'T WE JUST
NOT DO THE CEREMONY?

16:20.938 --> 16:22.189
SHE CAN'T MAKE US.

16:22.272 --> 16:24.316
- ASIDE FROM THE ADULTS,
ATTENDEES NEED DO NOTHING

16:24.400 --> 16:25.567
OTHER THAN BE PRESENT.

16:25.651 --> 16:26.860
- OH, NO.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.195
OKAY, MAYBE FABIAN'S WRONG.

16:28.278 --> 16:29.738
HOW CAN WE BE
THE DESCENDED, ANYWAY?

16:29.822 --> 16:31.573
- NO, HE THOUGHT DESCENDANT
MEANT ONE PERSON.

16:31.657 --> 16:34.410
IT MEANT MORE THAN ONE.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.370
- OH.

16:36.453 --> 16:38.247
IT ACTUALLY IS KIND OF COOL.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.873
- IT WOULD BE COOLER
IF IT DIDN'T MEAN

16:39.957 --> 16:41.583
WE WERE GOING TO UNLEASH
GREAT EVIL

16:41.667 --> 16:43.293
WHEN FROBIE WAKES UP.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.295
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
COME ON.

16:45.379 --> 16:47.339
[grunts]

16:52.761 --> 16:54.596
- WELL?
- VICTOR.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.266
I'VE JUST COME OFF THE PHONE
TO HARRIET.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.267
SHE SAYS EVERYTHING IS IN PLACE.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.061
THE DESCENDED
ARE FULLY PREPARED.

17:01.145 --> 17:02.688
- EXCELLENT.

17:02.771 --> 17:06.983
I CAN SCARCELY BELIEVE THE HOUR
IS UPON US AT LAST.

17:07.067 --> 17:09.569
WE SHOULD BEGIN
OUR OWN PREPARATIONS.

17:09.653 --> 17:11.905
OH, AND, ERIC,

17:11.989 --> 17:13.240
WAKING ROBERT WILL, PERHAPS,

17:13.323 --> 17:15.826
BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
WE EVER DO.

17:15.909 --> 17:18.162
THERE CAN BE NO MISTAKES.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.916
- THEY'RE ALL STRAIGHT "A"
SCIENCE STUDENTS.

17:24.001 --> 17:26.545
WALTER, HERE,
EVEN GOT A "HUNGH" ONCE.

17:26.627 --> 17:27.463
THAT'S A NEW LETTER
HE DISCOVERED WHICH COMES

17:27.546 --> 17:29.423
BEFORE AN "A."

17:29.506 --> 17:31.383
- OH, THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.135
OH, I LIKE WHAT YOU WROTE,
BY THE WAY.

17:33.218 --> 17:37.181
I ONLY HAD A FEW SMALL CHANGES
I WANTED TO MAKE.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.935
- THIS IS--

17:42.019 --> 17:44.980
THIS IS ALL ABOUT MYTHOLOGY,

17:45.063 --> 17:47.983
CRAZY STORIES ABOUT ECLIPSES.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.322
IT'S FUN, BUT IT WON'T GET US
AN "A."

17:53.405 --> 17:56.033
COME ON.

18:04.708 --> 18:07.753
- [whistling]

18:17.137 --> 18:18.222
- MORNING.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.085
- THERE MUST BE SOME SORT
OF SECRET DOOR SOMEWHERE.

18:48.168 --> 18:51.463
- SHE MUST HAVE
LOCKED IT SOMEHOW.

18:51.547 --> 18:52.840
- GUYS, WILL YOU STOP
WITH ALL THIS?

18:52.923 --> 18:56.510
- THANK YOU FOR THE ALARM CALL.

18:56.593 --> 18:58.595
- LOOK, IT'S JUST A SILLY
HISTORY PROJECT.

18:58.679 --> 18:59.721
WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

18:59.805 --> 19:03.851
- CEREMONIES, BAD TEACHERS,
GREAT EVIL,

19:03.934 --> 19:06.103
DOES NONE OF THIS
RING ANY BELLS FOR YOU?

19:11.441 --> 19:12.568
- OH, NO.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.153
HOW DID THEY--

19:14.236 --> 19:17.281
THERE'S AN E-MAIL FROM ME
TO MARA AND WILLOW

19:17.364 --> 19:18.323
EXPLAINING EVERYTHING!

19:18.407 --> 19:20.742
I DIDN'T SEND AN E-MAIL--

19:20.826 --> 19:22.578
JOY?

19:22.661 --> 19:23.704
YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T TELL!

19:23.787 --> 19:26.790
- I DIDN'T.

19:26.874 --> 19:27.791
YOU DID.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.501
- WAIT, WE HAD WI-FI
THE WHOLE TIME,

19:29.585 --> 19:30.460
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME?

19:30.544 --> 19:33.213
- I DON'T THINK SO, ALFIE.

19:33.297 --> 19:34.506
- [playing organ]

19:34.590 --> 19:36.592
- PATRICIA, THE ONLY THING
THAT RACKET WILL GET YOU

19:36.675 --> 19:41.263
IS AN EARACHE.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.223
WELL, I HOPE YOU ALL SLEPT WELL.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.726
AND I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL
LOOKING FORWARD

19:45.809 --> 19:47.352
TO THE ECLIPSE
AS MUCH AS I AM.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.234
[computer dings]

19:54.318 --> 19:56.278
- WILLOW, COULD YOU HELP ME
WITH SOMETHING?

19:56.361 --> 19:57.779
- OH, I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER ASK!

19:57.863 --> 20:00.115
I'M ACTUALLY BETTER AT MATH
THAN PEOPLE THINK.

20:00.198 --> 20:01.617
- I JUST NEED YOU
TO HOLD THE LADDER

20:01.700 --> 20:02.117
WHILE I PUT THE SUN UP.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.119
- [sighs]

20:04.202 --> 20:06.288
SO WILL YOUR BOYFRIEND BE HERE
FOR THE PRESENTATION?

20:06.371 --> 20:07.831
- OH, FOR SURE.
WILL YOURS?

20:07.915 --> 20:09.333
- HE WOULDN'T MISS IT
FOR THE WORLD.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.266
- HEY, CAROLINE.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.185
OR IS IT HARRIET?

20:28.268 --> 20:29.770
I GET CONFUSED.

20:29.853 --> 20:30.771
- WHAT?

20:30.854 --> 20:32.481
KT?

20:32.564 --> 20:35.150
