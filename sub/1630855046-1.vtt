WEBVTT

00:16.057 --> 00:17.559
It happens.

00:17.559 --> 00:20.311
How's your day going?
Really great. How's yours?

00:20.311 --> 00:21.354
Fantastic.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.565
Fantastic's, uh, fantastic.

00:23.565 --> 00:26.943
Sure is.
You up to anything fun this weekend?

00:26.943 --> 00:29.487
Just taking it easy,
hanging out with the missus.

00:29.487 --> 00:31.573
- Nice.
- How about you? Doing anything?

00:31.573 --> 00:34.826
Same, brother. Oh, except no missus.

00:34.826 --> 00:36.911
That might be a good thing.
Yeah.

00:36.911 --> 00:38.663
How is that Thompson's WaterSeal?

00:38.663 --> 00:41.124
It's really good.
It's like one of our popular ones.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.500
Nice.
All right.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.960
- Here's your receipt.
Thanks.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.128
Have a nice day.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.505
Just making a return.

00:47.505 --> 00:49.048
Everything okay?

00:49.048 --> 00:51.426
Yeah, just changed my mind.

00:52.010 --> 00:56.264
This is the third time you've bought
and returned these hibachi grills.

00:56.264 --> 00:58.933
Yeah, you know, just charcoal versus gas.

00:58.933 --> 01:00.226
It's hard to decide.

01:01.478 --> 01:04.022
I see you returned
the carbon monoxide detector again?

01:05.982 --> 01:08.276
I thought you guys had
a no-questions-asked policy.

01:08.276 --> 01:10.904
I'm not asking a question.
It's a statement.

01:11.863 --> 01:13.114
Okay.

01:13.114 --> 01:14.282
You got a receipt?

01:15.158 --> 01:15.992
Yeah.

01:16.493 --> 01:17.702
I got it somewhere.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.414
If you're making a return,

01:21.414 --> 01:23.416
please be sure
to have your receipts ready.

01:23.416 --> 01:24.793
Oh, come on.

01:27.003 --> 01:28.922
I'll just keep them, then, yeah?

01:29.422 --> 01:30.548
Super helpful.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.026
Always fucking something.

01:56.449 --> 01:58.118
There's always something.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.123
What? What?

02:05.583 --> 02:07.127
What is your prob--? What?

02:22.267 --> 02:23.184
Fuck this.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.905
Where you at? Where you at?

02:41.661 --> 02:42.662
Got you.

02:45.748 --> 02:47.417
What the fuck, man?

03:04.809 --> 03:06.519
Think I can't get you? Fuck.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.109
Who the fuck do you think you are, huh?

03:15.069 --> 03:16.863
Fucking shit.

03:16.863 --> 03:17.906
Fuck you!

03:21.784 --> 03:23.786
Are you fucking kidding me?

03:23.786 --> 03:26.080
Show your fucking face!

03:27.332 --> 03:28.333
Show your fucking face!

03:28.333 --> 03:31.210
- Show your fucking-- Fuck!

03:32.420 --> 03:33.421
Oh, shit.

03:39.218 --> 03:40.678
I got you, motherfucker.

03:49.854 --> 03:51.481
I'm so fucking sick of this shit!

03:51.481 --> 03:52.649
Every fucking day!

03:53.566 --> 03:57.779
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
Oh, my God, you fucking idiot.

04:00.114 --> 04:01.324
What are you doing?

04:02.784 --> 04:03.785
No.

04:04.369 --> 04:07.205
Stop. Stop, stop, stop!

04:14.754 --> 04:21.344
7-C-7-6-4-F-1.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.778
<i>♪ I dreamed about a girl
Who's a mix of Destiny's Child ♪</i>

04:38.778 --> 04:41.364
<i>♪ Just a little touch
Of Madonna's wild style ♪</i>

04:41.364 --> 04:42.907
<i>♪ With Janet Jackson's-- ♪</i>

05:03.720 --> 05:04.637
Oh.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.558
Are you kidding me?

05:10.476 --> 05:11.477
Figure it out.

05:18.484 --> 05:19.610
Just make it stop.

05:21.571 --> 05:22.405
Amy?

05:24.824 --> 05:25.783
Yeah?

05:29.662 --> 05:32.457
Are you okay?
Did something happen at Forsters?

05:32.457 --> 05:34.792
Oh. No. Everything went great.

05:34.792 --> 05:38.504
Jordan showed me her flagship store,
and she invited us to her home tomorrow.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.882
So, you know, usual lovefest.

05:41.674 --> 05:44.343
Well, then what's going on?
You seem all riled up.

05:45.762 --> 05:46.596
Babe.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.639
Come on.

05:48.639 --> 05:49.599
Talk to me.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.603
Okay, well, um...

05:54.437 --> 05:56.939
after the meeting,
I was sitting in the parking lot,

05:56.939 --> 06:02.361
thinking about how many meetings and calls
I've had to do for the last two years.

06:02.361 --> 06:06.991
Still somehow there's no offer coming,
and it just really got to me, you know?

06:06.991 --> 06:09.202
Then I started driving
and there was this guy--

06:09.202 --> 06:11.412
Amy, before you spiral...

06:12.622 --> 06:14.373
I'm gonna have you stop right there.

06:15.166 --> 06:16.417
Take a deep breath.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.128
Pause.

06:20.088 --> 06:23.466
You've got to start focusing
on the positive, okay?

06:24.717 --> 06:28.221
You know, maybe we should start doing
the gratitude journals again.

06:28.763 --> 06:29.806
Daddy!

06:29.806 --> 06:31.724
I need more markers!

06:32.225 --> 06:34.060
Our little artist.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.312
Uh...

06:36.312 --> 06:38.689
Gratitude journals.

06:38.689 --> 06:41.651
Yeah, you're right. Let's do it.
Thanks, babe.

06:43.069 --> 06:43.903
Come on.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.074
Junie!
- Mommy, we missed you!

06:48.074 --> 06:49.867
I missed you too, sweetie.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.911
Look at the vase Daddy made.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.122
- Oh.
- I think you're gonna love it.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.833
Yeah, you're right, Junie. I do love it.

06:56.833 --> 06:59.836
You're still cool with selling it
at your store, right, babe?

07:00.419 --> 07:02.964
- Mm-hm.
- I mean, if you've changed your mind...

07:03.840 --> 07:04.757
it's okay.

07:04.757 --> 07:08.594
They're just not really selling
at the gallery, so I don't know.

07:09.679 --> 07:10.638
I can do it.

07:21.983 --> 07:22.817
Paul.

07:25.528 --> 07:26.362
Paul!

07:29.449 --> 07:30.533
Hey, you home?

07:32.326 --> 07:35.288
Yo. You see a Forsters receipt anywhere?

07:35.788 --> 07:37.540
I'm in the middle of a game.

07:37.540 --> 07:41.836
Dude, pick up after yourself, man.

07:42.545 --> 07:43.671
You hear me?

07:43.671 --> 07:45.423
I'm in the middle of a game.

07:45.423 --> 07:49.469
Yo, this fucking guy today,
he starts honking at me, right?

07:51.137 --> 07:53.014
So I chased him down,

07:53.014 --> 07:55.224
scared the shit out of that motherfucker.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.810
That's what's wrong
with the world today, man.

07:57.810 --> 08:01.063
They want you to feel like
you have no control.

08:01.063 --> 08:02.106
You know?

08:02.732 --> 08:06.569
Like you're gonna eat shit
with a smile on your face or some shit.

08:06.569 --> 08:07.904
Fuck that, dude.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.197
Fuck it, man!

08:09.197 --> 08:11.699
I don't wanna--
I'm so sick of smiling, dude.

08:14.869 --> 08:15.870
Hi.

08:16.621 --> 08:19.916
<i>It's Mom. Have you been good?</i>

08:19.916 --> 08:22.627
Yes, Mom. How are you and Dad?

08:22.627 --> 08:26.506
<i>Living with your uncle has been tough.</i>

08:26.506 --> 08:29.217
- Hmm?
<i>- Dad and I fight every day too.</i>

08:29.217 --> 08:30.134
What?

08:30.134 --> 08:33.804
<i>I don't think he wants to work anymore.</i>

08:33.804 --> 08:36.098
<i>Why would I want to work at my age?</i>

08:36.724 --> 08:38.726
<i>I don't even have time to eat breakfast!</i>

08:38.726 --> 08:41.103
Mom, Dad, don't worry.

08:41.103 --> 08:42.438
Business is good.

08:43.272 --> 08:45.566
I'll buy that land you always wanted.

08:46.108 --> 08:47.652
I'll build a big house.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.320
<i>Sure.</i>

08:49.320 --> 08:50.655
No, really!

08:50.655 --> 08:54.450
<i>Anyway, stop worrying about us.</i>

08:54.450 --> 08:58.704
<i>Find a nice Korean girl at church
and get married.</i>

08:58.704 --> 09:00.206
<i>Start a family.</i>

09:00.206 --> 09:01.123
Okay.

09:02.208 --> 09:05.461
<i>And it'd be nice
if Paul started making some money.</i>

09:05.461 --> 09:07.672
He doesn't even leave his room.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.090
How's he gonna make money?

09:09.757 --> 09:12.176
Hey, I just bought this chain for two Gs.

09:12.176 --> 09:14.053
What the fuck did you guys do?

09:16.722 --> 09:18.599
I'll call you back.

09:21.727 --> 09:24.480
Paul can't play right now.
- What the fuck is your problem?

09:24.480 --> 09:27.275
- You making that money off crypto?
- It's none of your business.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.277
It is if you're gonna lose all your money.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.861
I know what I'm doing. All right?

09:30.861 --> 09:34.448
No, you don't, dude.
You promised you wouldn't do that shit.

09:34.448 --> 09:38.035
That's why I made more than you this week.
I don't have to fix toilets.

09:38.035 --> 09:40.788
I've been busting my ass
since Mom and Dad lost the motel.

09:40.788 --> 09:44.125
And you're gonna gamble
while they're going to work for <i>Samchon?</i>

09:44.125 --> 09:45.501
Should you be lecturing me

09:45.501 --> 09:48.546
when you're the one who let Isaac
run his shady shit at the motel?

09:48.546 --> 09:52.508
- It's why we lost it in the first place.
- He's our cousin.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.260
I did not know.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.971
Our family's a bunch of fucking losers.

09:58.639 --> 10:00.433
Write down all your passwords.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.269
- All of them. All your accounts.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

10:03.269 --> 10:05.605
I'm gonna change it
so you can't access that shit.

10:06.314 --> 10:07.440
Are you fucking serious?

10:07.440 --> 10:11.652
Yo, write down all your shit,
or you can start paying rent.

10:25.124 --> 10:25.958
All right.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.046
Did you eat?

10:32.798 --> 10:35.426
Yes, you're absolutely right.
I didn't think of that.

10:36.010 --> 10:36.844
Mm.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.555
No, I know. It's just, uh...

10:40.306 --> 10:44.226
I'm the owner so there's no one
higher up you can speak to--

10:45.061 --> 10:45.895
Hello?

10:46.896 --> 10:48.147
Hello?

10:48.147 --> 10:49.940
Your husband's brilliant.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.070
Yeah.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.905
No, he is. Um...

10:56.947 --> 11:01.327
The globs, they don't feel
too out of place in here?

11:01.327 --> 11:04.580
No, I think it's exactly
what the store needed.

11:04.580 --> 11:08.125
It's a good thought.
It's a very positive thought.

11:09.293 --> 11:12.088
I mean, you're both brilliant.

11:12.088 --> 11:15.591
Your life,
it's, like, such an inspiration.

11:15.591 --> 11:16.759
Thanks, Mia.

11:16.759 --> 11:19.387
I wake up every day feeling very lucky.

11:19.887 --> 11:21.889
You know, I got into design, like,

11:21.889 --> 11:24.934
right after we studied
Haru Nakai's work in college.

11:24.934 --> 11:27.561
Ah. Yeah, George's dad was very special.

11:27.561 --> 11:29.063
We miss him every day.

11:32.149 --> 11:33.275
What?

11:33.275 --> 11:36.028
That means "I'm sorry" in Japanese, right?

11:37.696 --> 11:38.739
Cool.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.032
Thanks.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.577
Love the space.

11:43.577 --> 11:45.204
Oh. Appreciate you, Mama.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.248
Let us know if you have
any questions, okay?

11:47.248 --> 11:48.833
Oh, my God. Amy Lau.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.501
Could we get a photo together?

11:50.501 --> 11:51.627
Of course.

11:51.627 --> 11:52.878
I got it.

11:52.878 --> 11:56.340
I've been buying your plants
online for years.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.259
I just thought I should stop by the store.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.635
- Oh, I love that.

11:59.635 --> 12:01.971
I read your interview in <i>Calabasas Style</i>

12:01.971 --> 12:03.264
and I just wanna say

12:03.264 --> 12:05.641
I really look up to you
and how you live your life.

12:05.641 --> 12:06.559
Thank you.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.145
I don't know how you keep it all together.

12:09.145 --> 12:12.940
Yeah, so he drove off
and I pretty much just played it cool.

12:12.940 --> 12:16.193
He's lucky though
'cause I would've gone nuts on him.

12:16.193 --> 12:17.945
I did get his license plate.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.947
Lot of crazy drivers these days.

12:19.947 --> 12:21.532
Yeah, yeah, I hear you.

12:21.532 --> 12:22.533
All right.

12:22.533 --> 12:25.661
- Okay.
There she is.

12:25.661 --> 12:28.122
I put in my own grout by the way.
Grout's easy.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.039
Okay, cool.

12:29.039 --> 12:30.916
Yeah, it looks great, so--

12:30.916 --> 12:35.588
Hey, bud, do you happen to have
those referrals I was asking about?

12:35.588 --> 12:38.466
- Remember I texted you about those?
- Yeah. Um--

12:38.466 --> 12:40.301
You know, I asked around

12:40.301 --> 12:43.679
and all my friends have a handyman so--

12:43.679 --> 12:44.597
Contractor.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.015
I'm a contractor.

12:47.057 --> 12:50.478
Yeah, yeah.
Of course, yeah, totally. Totally. Um...

12:50.478 --> 12:53.481
By the way, if you know
of a good tree trimmer,

12:53.481 --> 12:57.651
let me know, 'cause I've been
meaning to cut these bad boys.

12:57.651 --> 12:58.861
I could do it.

13:00.613 --> 13:03.115
Hmm? Oh.

13:03.115 --> 13:07.286
I mean, don't you need like
a certification or something?

13:07.286 --> 13:10.331
What, are you gonna get
a guy with, like, five stars on Yelp?

13:11.081 --> 13:12.500
Those reviews are fake, man.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.168
They're totally fake.

13:14.168 --> 13:17.213
Look, I'll come back tomorrow
with some dudes, 600 bucks.

13:17.213 --> 13:20.090
It would be nice to get it done. Um...

13:20.716 --> 13:21.926
Five-fifty?

13:25.221 --> 13:28.224
Uh... My guy.

13:28.224 --> 13:31.310
- Only 'cause it's you.
- All right. See you tomorrow.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.562
- Great.
- Okay, great. Yep.

13:36.273 --> 13:37.942
<i>Did you fire him yet?</i>

13:37.942 --> 13:40.319
<i>No. He's trimming the trees.</i>

13:40.319 --> 13:43.739
<i>Okay, you have to fire him
after that. He's so annoying.</i>

13:43.739 --> 13:44.657
<i>I know.</i>

13:44.657 --> 13:46.742
<i>I know, he really is.</i>

13:48.702 --> 13:49.995
It's perfect.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.122
Just like you.

13:52.831 --> 13:54.792
Can you go get me your other paintings?

13:54.792 --> 13:55.709
Okay.

13:58.462 --> 14:00.506
She needs a real art teacher.

14:00.506 --> 14:03.467
Your father always said
it's not about talent, it's about taste.

14:03.467 --> 14:05.844
Yeah, I know what you mean, Mom.

14:06.345 --> 14:10.599
Guys, I don't wanna
put pressure on Junie, okay?

14:10.599 --> 14:13.143
I mean, painting helps with her anxiety

14:13.143 --> 14:16.063
and she just stopped
picking her skin, so...

14:19.942 --> 14:23.028
But you know, we always appreciate
your advice, Fumi.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.823
And thank you so much
for babysitting tomorrow.

14:26.574 --> 14:29.618
A grandmother should spend time
with her grandchild.

14:33.247 --> 14:36.959
Yeah, and tomorrow's gonna be
a really big day

14:36.959 --> 14:40.546
because Jordan has finally invited us
to her home.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.507
Amy has been working
so hard on this sale, Mom.

14:43.507 --> 14:46.927
Kōyōhaus could be in every Forsters
all over the country.

14:46.927 --> 14:50.681
What she should do
is move her store to Rodeo Drive.

14:50.681 --> 14:52.808
- Ooh. I'll look into that.
Hey.

14:52.808 --> 14:54.602
Even if it all falls through,

14:54.602 --> 14:57.646
we have everything we need
right here, right, guys?

14:57.646 --> 14:59.815
- George.
Joji.

14:59.815 --> 15:02.192
Your whole house needs a remodel.

15:04.361 --> 15:07.448
Right, and, you know,
you're the one who wanted Junie

15:07.448 --> 15:12.328
in all those mindfulness classes
and organic gardening playgroups, so...

15:12.328 --> 15:15.706
All that matters is that June thrives
as her truest self.

15:15.706 --> 15:19.627
- Well, no one thrives for free, so--
- My sister was a loud eater.

15:20.336 --> 15:23.005
And you know, three years ago...

15:24.214 --> 15:26.592
her husband was struck by a train.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.556
I'm so sorry to hear that.

15:43.150 --> 15:44.526
Oh, shit.

15:47.821 --> 15:49.073
Yo, D!

15:49.073 --> 15:50.282
What's up, big boy?

15:50.282 --> 15:51.367
Yo.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.619
- Oh, my God.
- So sexy.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.829
- Oh!
What's up, man? Good to see you.

15:55.829 --> 15:59.375
Good to see you. Oh, my God.
Dude, so sexy, man.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.543
- Thank you.
- Come on, man. You look so good.

16:01.543 --> 16:02.461
You look good.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.463
- Have you been working out?
- Little bit.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.548
Miss, two ox bone soups.

16:07.591 --> 16:09.134
What's up?
- What's up, coz?

16:09.134 --> 16:10.886
How you doing? You look healthy.

16:10.886 --> 16:12.179
Three months out of jail.

16:12.179 --> 16:14.014
Thank God for the fucking Filipinos.

16:14.014 --> 16:15.683
- They had my back in there.
- Yeah.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.267
What about you, man? What's going on?

16:17.267 --> 16:18.769
Um, it's good.

16:18.769 --> 16:20.604
Yeah, it's good. It's busy.

16:20.604 --> 16:22.106
- Busy's good.
- Yeah.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.691
My folks are having a--

16:23.691 --> 16:26.944
- You know, having a rough time but, um...
- Mm.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.529
Yeah, since the motel.

16:29.196 --> 16:31.365
I feel like they're stuck in Korea
'cause of me.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.242
- Kind of shitty.
- All right.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.703
Like I told the cops,
you didn't do anything wrong.

16:35.703 --> 16:38.539
I didn't do anything wrong.
I was just the middle man, okay?

16:38.539 --> 16:40.582
Who knew you could
counterfeit baby formula?

16:40.582 --> 16:42.501
I didn't know. No one knew that, right?

16:42.501 --> 16:45.671
Yeah, totally,
no one knew that, so I mean--

16:45.671 --> 16:47.423
You're back up on your feet.

16:47.423 --> 16:49.174
It's all good. We love that.

16:49.925 --> 16:51.385
It's all good. Everybody's good.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.262
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.520
All right, man,
I just need a little money.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.022
Miss, over here!

17:03.022 --> 17:04.023
My bad. My bad.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.650
Can you lube my pussy
with kimchi juice before you--?

17:06.650 --> 17:09.361
- I'll pay you back.
- There's no soup. I just fucking sat down.

17:09.361 --> 17:12.531
We haven't even eaten yet!
Can we eat before you--?

17:12.531 --> 17:15.534
Isaac. Okay. I'm sorry. My bad.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.248
Sorry for yelling, first of all.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.708
I need to work on that. Um...

17:23.751 --> 17:25.461
I'm gonna give you the money.

17:25.461 --> 17:28.255
I feel bad about the motel,
so I'm gonna give you 20K.

17:28.255 --> 17:29.798
I'm just asking you,

17:29.798 --> 17:32.384
is there any way we can enjoy this meal?

17:32.384 --> 17:33.761
Dude, yes.

17:33.761 --> 17:36.055
- Hey, cheers, please.
- Thank you.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.627
Okay, here we go.

18:12.508 --> 18:15.427
I can't wait to cash out
and just stay home with June.

18:17.137 --> 18:20.224
Remember, if you have a bad trip,
I'm here for you.

18:20.224 --> 18:22.810
I've been microdosing to up my creativity.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.019
It's fine.

18:24.019 --> 18:26.814
This mushroom dinner
is just a means to an end.

18:26.814 --> 18:29.775
It's not enough for people like Jordan
to own a retail empire,

18:29.775 --> 18:31.443
they need to see God.

18:32.152 --> 18:33.946
Paul McCartney once saw God on a trip

18:33.946 --> 18:36.698
and said that God
looked like a massive wall.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.367
Say shit like that inside.

18:44.873 --> 18:45.958
Hey, by the way,

18:45.958 --> 18:49.837
if I go to a spiritual place tonight,
just let me go alone, okay?

18:50.712 --> 18:51.880
Wait. What?

18:57.386 --> 18:58.595
You hear that?

18:59.596 --> 19:01.056
Crows love me.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.151
See?

19:12.151 --> 19:13.443
No problemo.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.032
Come on, Danny.

19:19.908 --> 19:21.618
Come on, Danny.

19:29.251 --> 19:30.252
Fuck!

19:34.673 --> 19:35.883
Oh, fuck.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.472
Oh, my God.

19:42.472 --> 19:43.932
Holy shit!

19:43.932 --> 19:45.434
Lunch is on me, guys.

19:45.434 --> 19:48.353
<i>Danny, can we talk to you for a minute?</i>

19:48.353 --> 19:49.521
<i>Just fire him.</i>

19:52.399 --> 19:54.193
It's an ugly-ass house anyway.

19:59.781 --> 20:02.075
Yo. Where you going? Get in the car.

20:02.075 --> 20:03.577
My boy's picking me up.

20:03.577 --> 20:06.580
- Dude, just get in the car, Paul.
- He lives super close.

20:07.080 --> 20:07.915
All right.

20:10.584 --> 20:11.752
Uber for Paul?

20:18.342 --> 20:22.095
Mushrooms are the cornerstone
of every ecosystem.

20:22.095 --> 20:26.099
So as CEO of the Forsters Corporation,

20:26.099 --> 20:31.563
I am happy to announce
that we've partnered with a few nonprofits

20:31.563 --> 20:34.399
in the exploration of fungal utility.

20:34.983 --> 20:35.984
Medicine.

20:35.984 --> 20:37.486
What the hell is that?

20:38.403 --> 20:40.197
Babe, it's a mushroom pizza.

20:44.868 --> 20:48.205
George, they're normal mushrooms.

20:48.205 --> 20:49.998
This is so stupid.

20:49.998 --> 20:54.962
As my father used to say,
"You can eat any mushroom once."

20:59.216 --> 21:02.427
Hi. Sorry. Hi. Before we dig in,

21:02.427 --> 21:08.058
I just need to take a moment
to say a toast to our inspiring host,

21:08.058 --> 21:10.686
my sister-in-law Jordana Forster.

21:10.686 --> 21:14.564
I remember the first time
you took me foraging.

21:14.564 --> 21:17.109
We were visiting my motherland...

21:17.109 --> 21:19.194
<i>You've reached Brianna Kinsley Realty.</i>

21:19.194 --> 21:20.904
<i>- Please leave a message.</i>

21:20.904 --> 21:25.617
Hi, this is Danny Cho. I'm calling
about the Summit Drive property.

21:25.617 --> 21:29.037
I run a very successful
residential construction company

21:29.037 --> 21:31.123
and I'm very serious about buying.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.875
So please call me back. Thank you so much.

21:39.756 --> 21:41.758
Hi, this is Danny Cho again.

21:41.758 --> 21:44.261
I just called
about the Summit Drive property.

21:44.261 --> 21:48.265
<i>I wasn't sure if this is a landline.
Here's my number just in case.</i>

21:48.265 --> 21:52.477
<i>818-555-4181.</i>

21:54.062 --> 21:55.564
Hi, Danny again.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.858
I also have money.

21:57.858 --> 22:01.194
<i>For the down payment.
I forgot to mention that. I have money.</i>

22:01.194 --> 22:02.612
<i>Please call me back.</i>

22:09.619 --> 22:10.704
Fuck.

22:17.669 --> 22:20.422
There's always something. What the fuck?

22:47.949 --> 22:51.286
You never mentioned
you were married to Haru Nakai's son.

22:51.286 --> 22:53.997
- Hello?
- Well, I didn't know you were a fan.

22:53.997 --> 22:55.665
- Yes.
- You know what?

22:55.665 --> 22:58.126
You should come to this gallery opening
tomorrow night.

22:58.126 --> 23:00.253
George is loaning
one of his father's pieces.

23:00.253 --> 23:02.297
Really? I would love that.

23:02.297 --> 23:05.008
Nobody else in my family
understands culture.

23:05.008 --> 23:07.803
That's why Forsters
has been stuck in the past.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.304
That's why you're here.

23:09.304 --> 23:10.514
To change that.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.182
See? I like you.

23:12.182 --> 23:15.352
You have this serene
Zen Buddhist thing going on.

23:15.352 --> 23:17.562
Well, you know, just doing me.

23:17.562 --> 23:18.647
Here you are.

23:18.647 --> 23:20.398
- Thanks very much. Thanks.
- Thank you.

23:21.233 --> 23:25.862
Listen, obviously I didn't invite you here
just to eat weird shit.

23:25.862 --> 23:27.989
I don't even like mushrooms.

23:27.989 --> 23:29.825
- Except for the magic kind.
- Mm-hm.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.120
There's an offer being drawn up.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.247
Expect a term sheet tomorrow.

23:36.331 --> 23:37.707
Oh, my God.

23:37.707 --> 23:39.543
Thank you so much, Jordan.

23:39.543 --> 23:43.421
I can't wait to see
what you do with Kōyōhaus.

23:43.421 --> 23:47.008
Okay, there'll be a few weeks
of due diligence.

23:47.008 --> 23:48.552
A couple of months, max.

23:48.552 --> 23:51.555
Yeah, of course. No skeletons here.

23:51.555 --> 23:52.472
Good.

23:53.306 --> 23:54.766
Don't fuck this up.

23:55.350 --> 23:57.644
'Cause you and I both know
I could just go to China

23:57.644 --> 23:59.437
and copy your shit for less.

23:59.980 --> 24:03.024
Yeah. I mean, let's keep
the jobs in America, right?

24:03.024 --> 24:04.317
Totally.

24:04.317 --> 24:05.277
Cheers.

24:22.669 --> 24:23.670
Oh, thank God.

24:48.820 --> 24:49.946
What the fuck?

24:52.949 --> 24:55.035
Mommy!

24:56.328 --> 24:57.162
<i>Hey.</i>

24:57.913 --> 24:59.206
Hey, hey.

24:59.206 --> 25:02.250
Hey, it was just a bad dream,
sweetie, okay?

25:03.001 --> 25:04.920
You can go back to sleep. Mama's here.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.797
What if the nightmare comes back?

25:07.797 --> 25:09.049
Well, um...

25:09.966 --> 25:14.888
you know, whenever I have a bad dream,
I just think of a happy time.

25:15.722 --> 25:16.723
You do?

25:16.723 --> 25:17.724
Yeah.

25:18.683 --> 25:21.519
In fact, I think
of a happy time with you, Junie.

25:22.437 --> 25:24.689
I think about the day you were born.

25:26.900 --> 25:31.321
You know, for the longest time
you were growing inside of Mama's belly.

25:31.321 --> 25:33.490
And then all of a sudden, poof.

25:33.490 --> 25:36.993
You were right there, looking back at me.

25:38.787 --> 25:40.789
And then the crazy part was...

25:41.957 --> 25:43.333
you were already you.

25:47.045 --> 25:49.005
I remember the hospital bed.

25:51.299 --> 25:52.467
I remember the...

25:54.177 --> 25:56.471
the blanket around your little face.

25:59.641 --> 26:03.937
It was 4:00 a.m.
and the whole city was silent.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.066
No meetings.

26:08.066 --> 26:09.442
No e-mails.

26:12.362 --> 26:13.488
No pretending.

26:16.825 --> 26:18.326
It was just you and me.

26:21.579 --> 26:25.709
And there was nothing wrong
anywhere in the entire universe.

26:32.590 --> 26:34.509
I wish we could've stayed there.

26:46.229 --> 26:47.981
Nobody understands.

26:49.316 --> 26:50.150
Fuck you.

26:51.484 --> 26:52.861
You don't even know.

26:54.070 --> 26:55.989
And when I'm dead, you will see.

26:55.989 --> 26:57.866
You will fucking see.

27:04.497 --> 27:05.832
"To ensure high CO levels,

27:05.832 --> 27:08.877
wait for hibachis
to set off the detector." I did that.

27:34.652 --> 27:35.820
No, this is not it.

27:38.114 --> 27:40.533
Ah! Fuck.

27:58.593 --> 28:00.887
Jesus, it's been there the whole time.

28:29.207 --> 28:30.166
This fucking guy.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.219
You gotta catch me!

28:41.928 --> 28:45.390
Hey, sweetheart,
do we have any nine-volt batteries?

28:45.390 --> 28:47.767
Uh, I don't think so. Why?

28:47.767 --> 28:50.061
Uh, I just think we need to replace some.

28:50.687 --> 28:51.813
Uh, in what?

28:51.813 --> 28:53.064
I'll take a look later.

28:53.064 --> 28:56.151
I think in the safe?

29:00.113 --> 29:01.990
Why were you opening the safe?

29:02.741 --> 29:06.161
Uh, well, you know, I've been seeing
all these Nextdoor posts

29:06.161 --> 29:08.913
and people are fricking crazy out there.

29:08.913 --> 29:11.166
Well, I changed the combo.

29:12.333 --> 29:13.960
Oh. Well, maybe--

29:13.960 --> 29:17.672
You don't think, like,
I should have the new combo?

29:17.672 --> 29:21.050
What if something bad happens,
like someone follows me home or something?

29:21.050 --> 29:21.968
Amy.

29:22.802 --> 29:24.929
You know why I didn't tell you.

29:28.767 --> 29:29.851
Dad?

29:32.645 --> 29:34.022
Wait, sweetie.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.316
Hey, stop, honey.

29:36.316 --> 29:39.819
Okay, you have a wonderful day. Okay?

29:39.819 --> 29:42.906
And you tell Mommy
all about it later, all right?

29:45.325 --> 29:46.826
Mom.

29:46.826 --> 29:47.744
Stop.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.455
Come on, Dad, let's go.

29:54.667 --> 29:57.670
377 Bon Homme Road.

29:59.005 --> 30:00.757
"377 Bon Homme.

30:00.757 --> 30:03.676
I live at 377 Bon Homme."

30:04.385 --> 30:05.970
Fucking dick-ass.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.353
One-one-one-four.

30:14.604 --> 30:16.064
One-one-one-four.

30:16.064 --> 30:18.566
320, 3...

30:19.526 --> 30:21.194
323.

30:21.194 --> 30:23.905
Where the fuck is 377? What the fuck?

30:29.702 --> 30:31.746
<i>You didn't think I would find you?</i>

30:31.746 --> 30:34.749
<i>I'm gonna find you, motherfucker.</i>

30:35.875 --> 30:37.669
Oh, I'm gonna whoop your fucking--

30:47.428 --> 30:48.346
<i>What?</i>

30:48.346 --> 30:49.973
<i>You wanna go? Let's go.</i>

30:49.973 --> 30:51.683
<i>Let's fucking go right now.</i>

30:51.683 --> 30:53.017
<i>You wanna fucking go?</i>

30:53.017 --> 30:54.811
Let's fucking go, motherfucker!

31:01.359 --> 31:03.152
<i>Bon Homme.</i>

31:03.152 --> 31:05.321
Bon Homme. Bon Homme.

31:05.321 --> 31:07.365
"E.T. Bon Homme."

31:15.456 --> 31:16.291
Yum.

31:19.002 --> 31:20.920
Where the fuck do you live?

31:30.179 --> 31:31.306
Hi.

31:31.306 --> 31:32.599
Can I help you?

31:35.143 --> 31:36.895
Sorry to bother you.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.647
I'm a contractor working down the street.

31:39.647 --> 31:41.524
Did you remodel recently?

31:42.650 --> 31:44.819
Uh, yeah. Why?

31:46.779 --> 31:48.072
Well, I couldn't help but notice

31:48.072 --> 31:50.867
that your rooftop conduits
don't have supports.

31:50.867 --> 31:53.119
It's an electrical hazard.

31:53.119 --> 31:54.037
What?

31:54.787 --> 31:57.248
I'm not trying
to make any money off of you.

31:57.248 --> 32:02.170
I just thought I'd come and let you know
so you can get your guy to fix it.

32:03.796 --> 32:07.091
Hey, you're not some kind
of weirdo, right?

32:07.091 --> 32:10.178
'Cause if you are,
you should know that I own a gun.

32:11.346 --> 32:14.557
Like I said, miss,
I'm just trying to be helpful.

32:14.557 --> 32:17.810
Didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.
I'll be on my way.

32:19.479 --> 32:21.522
Hey, no, just wait a second.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.943
Okay? I'll be right there, just--

32:35.662 --> 32:36.704
Hi.

32:37.497 --> 32:38.331
Hi.

32:40.249 --> 32:42.502
Thank you so much
for checking out the roof.

32:42.502 --> 32:43.628
I really appreciate it.

32:43.628 --> 32:44.921
Yeah, of course.

32:44.921 --> 32:47.340
Is there anything else
you want me to look at while I'm here?

32:47.340 --> 32:49.759
Oh, no, we just did this whole remodel.

32:49.759 --> 32:51.636
Everything in the kitchen is brand-new

32:51.636 --> 32:53.721
and my mother-in-law
thinks it's all basic,

32:53.721 --> 32:56.307
but I don't know,
I feel like I did a good job.

32:56.307 --> 32:58.977
Oh, you did good, all right.

33:00.144 --> 33:02.855
Well, please tell that to her
and my husband.

33:02.855 --> 33:04.440
Is he home right now?

33:06.192 --> 33:07.193
Um...

33:08.987 --> 33:11.072
He won't be home for a while.

33:11.781 --> 33:12.699
Mm.

33:19.414 --> 33:20.289
Oh.

33:20.289 --> 33:21.874
He's Japanese.

33:23.710 --> 33:24.544
Yeah.

33:27.714 --> 33:30.258
Hey, where's your garage?

33:33.720 --> 33:36.264
You know, we actually had to have
two different companies

33:36.264 --> 33:37.765
do the cabinetry.

33:37.765 --> 33:40.268
It was a whole thing.
Took forever to finish.

33:40.268 --> 33:44.063
- Hmm.
- But you know, it worked out.

33:46.566 --> 33:50.069
Ah, yeah, definitely see some warp here.

33:50.069 --> 33:52.739
I'm sorry. Are you serious right now?

33:52.739 --> 33:56.034
Yeah, it's just absorbing
all this moisture.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.953
- Fuck. There's always something.
- Yes.

33:58.953 --> 34:00.705
There's always something.

34:00.705 --> 34:05.168
It's, like, you work so hard for so long
just to provide for your family, right?

34:05.168 --> 34:07.503
Yeah. If not you, then who's gonna?

34:07.503 --> 34:08.671
Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah.

34:08.671 --> 34:11.716
And then at some point,
you think you'd get to relax, but no.

34:11.716 --> 34:15.136
There's too much moisture, so now
I gotta redo these fucking cabinets.

34:15.136 --> 34:17.346
I gotta redo the roof probably,

34:17.346 --> 34:20.266
and then by the time I'm done,
I'm running out of money,

34:20.266 --> 34:21.601
the kitchen's out of style,

34:21.601 --> 34:24.645
and the whole time,
all I wanted was a fucking hot tub.

34:26.105 --> 34:27.774
You have a timeless kitchen.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.194
So I think you're okay.

34:31.194 --> 34:33.237
- I'm sorry. I just...

34:34.447 --> 34:35.573
I'm just tired.

34:35.573 --> 34:37.658
Oh, don't be sorry. You're fine.

34:37.658 --> 34:40.161
I'm-- I feel you. I understand.

34:40.912 --> 34:42.663
That's a nice car.

34:42.663 --> 34:44.624
Your husband like driving this?

34:45.416 --> 34:48.294
Uh, he actually drives
the minivan for the kid

34:48.294 --> 34:51.089
and I drive the luxury car for work.

34:53.216 --> 34:54.550
Nice.

34:54.550 --> 34:55.593
Yeah.

34:59.013 --> 35:00.848
Do you mind if I use your restroom?

35:00.848 --> 35:03.434
Hey, babe, call me back when you get this.

35:03.434 --> 35:05.269
I'm so upset.

35:05.269 --> 35:10.108
Thank God this contractor came over
and he caught everything.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.609
- Our fucking cabinets--

35:11.609 --> 35:13.277
Oh, you know, I gotta go.

35:13.277 --> 35:16.072
Hey, thanks again for everything.

35:16.072 --> 35:18.282
We should exchange numbers--

35:18.282 --> 35:20.660
I'm late for an appointment
so I gotta go. Bye.

35:35.550 --> 35:37.135
What the fuck?

35:44.517 --> 35:46.644
What the fuck?

35:53.776 --> 35:55.528
