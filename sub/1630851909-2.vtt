WEBVTT

00:18.666 --> 00:20.666
-What do we have?
-"What do we have"?

00:20.750 --> 00:22.750
Do you think this is NCIS?

00:24.583 --> 00:25.416
Hello.

00:27.416 --> 00:30.916
No, we are not assuming
that a masked murderer killed Arvid.

00:32.250 --> 00:35.541
This is probably
just a case of an old man who fell.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.458
Old stone stairs are lethal.

00:39.541 --> 00:42.291
I applied to have
these stairs secured in 2014.

00:42.375 --> 00:44.000
I haven't even gotten an answer.

00:45.708 --> 00:46.541
No.

00:49.583 --> 00:52.583
He was standing there, was unlucky,

00:52.666 --> 00:54.208
lost his balance, and…

00:56.875 --> 00:58.125
And landed on an urn.

00:58.958 --> 00:59.791
Or several.

01:01.625 --> 01:04.541
But what was he doing here
in the middle of the night?

01:05.083 --> 01:07.416
Who knows with these Hallangen people?

01:07.500 --> 01:11.166
He has a key card,
so he was probably polishing some brass.

01:11.833 --> 01:17.541
Yeah. This is the second death
within one family in one week.

01:17.625 --> 01:20.208
No, it's number one and a half.

01:20.291 --> 01:22.166
Live doesn't count.

01:23.666 --> 01:25.625
You're not really dead
until you end up here.

01:34.916 --> 01:35.750
Live?

01:43.916 --> 01:45.708
Come home to the apartment,

01:45.791 --> 01:47.375
and I'll show you.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.500
Then you'll understand

01:49.583 --> 01:52.500
that you're not what you think you are.

02:05.791 --> 02:06.916
Dad?

02:10.375 --> 02:12.750
A NETFLIX SERIES

03:03.958 --> 03:06.041
-Skarnes taxi.
-Hello.

03:06.125 --> 03:08.916
Could you please send a taxi
to Hallangen Funeral Parlor?

04:55.958 --> 04:59.625
I know it will be difficult,
but this is not a life.

05:00.458 --> 05:02.000
You said that there's…

05:02.625 --> 05:05.416
-Mom?
-…a light at the end of the tunnel.

05:05.500 --> 05:08.041
But this isn't a tunnel.

05:08.125 --> 05:09.750
It's a big, black hole.

05:10.625 --> 05:14.625
So if you see my darkness in Live…

05:29.916 --> 05:34.458
…if you see my darkness in Live…
You know what you have to do.

05:54.875 --> 05:57.875
HALLANGEN FUNERAL PARLOR

05:59.791 --> 06:02.333
If someone is out to get
the Hallangen family,

06:02.416 --> 06:03.625
we should warn Odd…

06:03.708 --> 06:06.625
No one is out to get the Hallangen family.

06:06.708 --> 06:07.583
No.

06:09.208 --> 06:10.916
But Live said she rememb…

06:16.250 --> 06:18.625
-What about the necklace?
-Know how much an autopsy costs?

06:19.791 --> 06:21.833
Are you gonna send him for an autopsy?

06:21.916 --> 06:23.875
Not because I think he was murdered.

06:24.416 --> 06:27.708
But because the local paper would love it
if we made another mistake.

06:28.708 --> 06:30.291
But you're sending him for an autopsy?

06:33.166 --> 06:34.083
I'm proud of you.

06:35.041 --> 06:36.750
Proud of me!

06:37.541 --> 06:38.875
You!

06:38.958 --> 06:39.791
Yeah.

06:39.875 --> 06:41.416
You're a fine one to talk.

06:47.208 --> 06:48.791
That only took an hour.

06:51.166 --> 06:53.875
But look at that.
He took a taxi to the crime scene.

06:53.958 --> 06:56.041
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

07:02.125 --> 07:04.125
-He's in here.
-Yeah.

07:26.250 --> 07:28.791
Let me know
if I can help you with anything.

07:28.875 --> 07:29.958
I can handle it.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.166
-I meant with carrying or…
-I can handle it.

07:39.875 --> 07:40.958
My condolences.

07:42.416 --> 07:44.625
Do you know
what "condolence" means, Reinert?

07:46.166 --> 07:47.875
It means, "I feel your pain."

07:49.333 --> 07:50.208
Do you?

07:51.166 --> 07:52.291
Do you feel my pain?

07:53.791 --> 07:55.875
I can relate, with some exceptions…

07:57.166 --> 07:59.583
We'd like you to take him to the coroner.

08:00.750 --> 08:01.708
Why?

08:02.875 --> 08:03.708
Did someone…

08:03.791 --> 08:07.416
You've done this long enough
to know it doesn't have to mean anything.

08:07.500 --> 08:10.083
At the same time,
we don't want to rule anything out.

08:10.166 --> 08:13.875
If there's anything,
we'll know after the autopsy.

08:14.458 --> 08:15.958
Without a doubt. Always.

09:03.375 --> 09:04.916
-Hello.
-Hello.

09:58.125 --> 09:58.958
Goodbye.

10:05.875 --> 10:06.833
Live?

10:08.750 --> 10:09.708
Live?

10:10.333 --> 10:13.166
Yes? Hang on.

10:13.250 --> 10:14.291
I'm coming.

10:18.125 --> 10:19.583
-Hi, sweetie.
-Hi.

10:19.666 --> 10:21.041
Are you up there alone?

10:22.833 --> 10:23.791
Yeah.

10:24.666 --> 10:28.500
I think I'll just call the nursing home
and say I'm not coming in today.

10:29.041 --> 10:31.625
Then we can spend some time together and…

10:32.333 --> 10:35.000
You've gone through a lot lately,
so it may be smart to…

10:35.083 --> 10:37.791
Actually, I was thinking
I might want to go to work.

10:37.875 --> 10:39.291
-Today?
-Yeah…

10:40.708 --> 10:41.708
It's just…

10:44.708 --> 10:48.250
-I don't really want to be here.
-No…

10:48.333 --> 10:50.666
Maybe it would be nice
to think about something else.

10:50.750 --> 10:54.166
Understandable. I understand…
I can understand.

10:54.625 --> 10:58.333
Okay, can we just make a deal, then,
that you tell me

10:58.416 --> 11:00.083
if you're not feeling well?

11:00.166 --> 11:01.166
Yeah, absolutely.

11:01.291 --> 11:05.833
Because then it wouldn't be wise to work,
with regard to patient safety.

11:05.916 --> 11:07.166
-Of course.
-Okay.

11:23.333 --> 11:25.750
FIRST NAME: ARVID

11:30.041 --> 11:30.875
Holy shit.

11:31.791 --> 11:33.166
How can you stand this?

11:36.083 --> 11:37.083
Here you go.

11:40.875 --> 11:42.375
Can you help me a little?

11:45.125 --> 11:46.875
Aren't there usually two of you?

11:46.958 --> 11:49.375
Yeah, usually.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.625
Sorry, man. My job is
to open doors and receive paperwork.

11:54.833 --> 11:58.833
Yeah, it would be weird if morgue security
was comfortable around corpses.

11:58.916 --> 12:02.625
I'm just here until I have enough credits
to enter the police academy.

12:02.708 --> 12:03.625
How exciting.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Well done.

12:32.208 --> 12:35.500
Oh, I love you.

12:35.583 --> 12:37.375
Are you talking to me or this?

12:37.458 --> 12:39.166
-Both of you.
-Okay.

12:40.875 --> 12:43.500
Live, I've got one for you today.

12:45.041 --> 12:49.250
Today, we have Hitler,
Trump, and Margaret Thatcher.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.875
Who do you want to kill,

12:51.958 --> 12:54.250
who do you want to marry,

12:54.333 --> 12:56.291
and who do you want to sleep with?

13:00.666 --> 13:01.875
Kill Hitler.

13:01.958 --> 13:03.000
Oh yes.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.541
-Yes.
-Yes, yes.

13:04.625 --> 13:05.750
And…

13:08.291 --> 13:09.625
sleep with Trump, maybe?

13:09.708 --> 13:11.458
Oh, but Live…

13:11.541 --> 13:13.250
-Because…
-What?

13:13.333 --> 13:15.875
I think he'll fall asleep
before anything happens.

13:15.958 --> 13:17.250
-You think so?
-Yeah.

13:17.958 --> 13:19.833
That's clever thinking,

13:19.916 --> 13:21.916
I have to say.

13:25.708 --> 13:27.541
Is everything okay, Live?

13:28.083 --> 13:30.041
Yeah, everything's fine.

13:50.416 --> 13:57.208
HALLANGEN FUNERAL PARLOR

14:51.125 --> 14:53.125
HALLANGEN FUNERAL PARLOR

15:05.250 --> 15:08.000
All right,
you're going to feel a slight prick.

15:09.958 --> 15:13.666
-You're doing so well, Mrs. Gundersen.
-Thank you.

15:13.750 --> 15:16.166
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

15:16.250 --> 15:20.083
I was a blood donor, you know. From 1968.

15:20.958 --> 15:24.500
But then I had to stop
because my heart couldn't handle it.

15:25.166 --> 15:28.750
And it was very sad…

15:42.041 --> 15:42.875
Live!

15:43.750 --> 15:45.958
Live! Get out of here.

17:06.041 --> 17:06.916
Live?

17:09.625 --> 17:11.291
Live, how's it going in there?

17:15.083 --> 17:18.125
-Hi.
-Hi. I'm perfectly fine.

17:18.208 --> 17:20.250
Okay, good. So what happened?

17:21.791 --> 17:25.666
I don't know. I just got very dizzy.
How is she?

17:25.750 --> 17:28.208
-She's fine.
-I'm going to apologize.

17:28.291 --> 17:30.208
No, I don't think you… She's sleeping now,

17:30.291 --> 17:34.000
so I actually think it's a good idea
if you go home and relax a bit.

17:37.166 --> 17:39.625
But I actually feel okay.

17:39.708 --> 17:41.958
Yeah, I know, but just to be completely…

17:42.875 --> 17:44.125
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

17:45.833 --> 17:48.875
-Yeah, okay. I'll see you at home, then.
-Yeah, great.

17:54.541 --> 17:57.375
First of all,
I want to express my condolences.

17:57.458 --> 17:58.416
Thank you.

17:59.125 --> 18:01.666
It's not nice when parents die,
that's for sure.

18:01.750 --> 18:02.583
No.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.541
As you probably know,
we've tried to reach your father.

18:06.625 --> 18:10.166
Yeah, I've realized that
something had escaped his attention.

18:10.250 --> 18:12.500
He hasn't paid his mortgage for a year.

18:12.583 --> 18:14.583
We have several cases against him

18:14.666 --> 18:18.875
that we'll now pass on to the new owner
of Hallangen Funeral Parlor.

18:18.958 --> 18:20.666
-That's you, Odd.
-Yeah.

18:22.666 --> 18:25.000
Yeah, I was thinking that,

18:25.083 --> 18:28.666
as a temporary solution,
we could take out a loan on the house?

18:28.750 --> 18:30.416
You can't take out more loans on it.

18:31.666 --> 18:32.500
No.

18:35.916 --> 18:36.875
So what can we do?

18:37.541 --> 18:39.416
Pay attention now, Odd. Let's see…

18:40.666 --> 18:43.333
Let's see.
This here, these are your expenses.

18:45.625 --> 18:50.125
-That's not so bad, is it?
-No, but new coffins, car repairs,

18:50.208 --> 18:55.166
loans, expenses, expenses…

19:03.083 --> 19:05.041
Frode, this is going to be okay.

19:05.625 --> 19:06.625
In the long term?

19:13.250 --> 19:15.666
Everyone in Skarnes
will die at some point.

19:16.375 --> 19:17.625
Some before others.

19:18.375 --> 19:20.583
They have to come to me.
They have no choice.

19:20.666 --> 19:23.041
I'll give you two weeks
before I foreclose.

19:25.958 --> 19:26.791
On my house?

19:26.875 --> 19:29.375
-Yes.
-I live there, my wife lives there, we…

19:29.458 --> 19:32.666
-We're making a nursery. Five generations!
-Odd…

19:33.291 --> 19:34.875
I did express my condolences.

20:08.125 --> 20:10.500
We have a homicide on our hands, Judith.

20:11.416 --> 20:13.416
This is a waste of expertise.

20:14.708 --> 20:16.250
Traffic lights could have done that.

20:16.333 --> 20:19.500
No, a traffic light would have shown
more feeling and enthusiasm.

20:20.791 --> 20:25.083
We can't afford traffic lights.
So we have to help the school children…

20:25.166 --> 20:27.250
-People are being murdered.
-…cross the road.

20:27.333 --> 20:30.041
We can't do anything right now
with this potential homicide case

20:30.125 --> 20:32.125
while Arvid is being autopsied.

20:37.375 --> 20:40.500
Okay, a man and a woman's
car breaks down in the wilderness.

20:40.583 --> 20:43.958
-The man leaves the woman to get help…
-Why doesn't he call?

20:44.666 --> 20:46.666
That's not the premise of the problem.

20:46.750 --> 20:49.791
How can I solve a logic problem
when the problem lacks logic?

20:49.875 --> 20:52.916
-There was no signal.
-In Norway in 2021?

20:53.000 --> 20:56.666
Yeah, this was in the '80s
and in the Soviet Union.

20:56.750 --> 20:59.041
-Okay. Here. Here he is.
-Okay.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.125
-Can I continue?
-Yes, you can continue now.

21:01.708 --> 21:03.791
The man says, "I'll be back soon."

21:03.875 --> 21:06.541
"Lock the car,
and don't open it for anyone but me."

21:06.625 --> 21:09.291
-Okay.
-He comes back a few hours later.

21:09.375 --> 21:13.750
The woman is dead, but there's another
person in the car with her. Who is it?

21:13.833 --> 21:15.625
-Another person?
-Yeah.

21:16.416 --> 21:18.333
-Did someone break in?
-No.

21:19.083 --> 21:21.583
-And she's dead?
-Really dead.

21:24.333 --> 21:26.958
Okay. Any more guesses, or do you give up?

21:27.041 --> 21:29.291
Did someone trick her
into opening the door?

21:29.375 --> 21:31.875
-Someone who looks like her husband?
-Nope.

21:34.375 --> 21:37.250
But who did it, then?
Who is the person in the car?

21:37.791 --> 21:39.291
-Should I tell you?
-Yes.

21:41.458 --> 21:42.708
-It's a baby.
-Huh?

21:43.291 --> 21:46.541
She was pregnant.
That was the other person in the car.

21:46.625 --> 21:49.875
But why did the husband tell her
not to open for anyone?

21:50.916 --> 21:51.916
I don't know.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.625
What does that matter?
The world is a dangerous place.

21:54.708 --> 21:56.125
I said it was the Soviet Union.

22:05.791 --> 22:06.625
What?

22:07.291 --> 22:09.000
Don't tell me he's awake too.

22:09.083 --> 22:10.041
Look.

22:17.708 --> 22:21.333
-Are you going to answer that?
-No, we're having a work discussion.

22:22.166 --> 22:24.083
-Yeah, it's RMI.
-Okay.

22:25.125 --> 22:28.250
-The forensic institute.
-Yeah, I'll call them later.

22:33.250 --> 22:34.833
Judith Berg Åsen's phone.

22:35.875 --> 22:37.791
Hi, it's Brynjar from forensics.

22:38.666 --> 22:40.041
Am I on speaker?

22:40.750 --> 22:41.708
Hi, Brynjar.

22:42.541 --> 22:44.250
Yes, what can we do for you?

22:44.333 --> 22:49.000
Arvid Hallangen shows
clear signs that his ribs were broken.

22:50.250 --> 22:51.083
And?

22:52.541 --> 22:55.375
Yeah, that doesn't happen
if he falls backwards down the stairs.

22:55.458 --> 22:57.458
Someone must have pushed him.

23:01.416 --> 23:02.500
Shit.

23:04.291 --> 23:06.375
I won't say I told you so.

23:06.458 --> 23:07.541
No, you won't.

23:07.625 --> 23:09.208
But I did tell you so!

23:09.291 --> 23:10.291
Don't, Reinert.

23:11.333 --> 23:12.166
Shit.

23:12.958 --> 23:16.333
-Let's not jump to conclusions now.
-There's a killer on the loose in Skarnes.

23:16.416 --> 23:18.333
Someone is after the Hallangen family.

23:20.041 --> 23:21.625
I knew it!

23:21.708 --> 23:22.666
Reinert…

23:24.041 --> 23:24.875
Hello?

23:25.625 --> 23:27.000
Am I still on speaker?

23:40.583 --> 23:42.500
The next stop is…

24:01.041 --> 24:02.208
Live!

24:04.583 --> 24:05.666
Reinert?

24:07.833 --> 24:10.291
I'm going to close off this area now,

24:10.375 --> 24:13.083
and then I'll… I mean, we, the police.

24:13.166 --> 24:17.833
Judith is also really invested,
and we're going to figure this out.

24:19.291 --> 24:22.041
You see, I'm convinced
that whoever tried to kill you

24:23.000 --> 24:26.125
is the same person
who's responsible for Arvid's death,

24:26.208 --> 24:29.958
and I won't rest
until I catch that person, okay?

24:31.458 --> 24:32.291
Okay.

24:38.166 --> 24:39.000
Thanks.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.416
It's the least I can do.

25:03.458 --> 25:04.333
Are you okay?

25:06.500 --> 25:08.250
I just got really dizzy.

25:09.833 --> 25:12.166
I actually feel perfectly fine now.

25:12.250 --> 25:14.833
It was just an acute dizziness.

25:15.500 --> 25:16.666
-Dizziness?
-Yes.

25:18.208 --> 25:19.458
Yeah, and otherwise?

25:21.000 --> 25:22.833
-Otherwise?
-Yeah, any symptoms?

25:26.291 --> 25:27.333
No.

25:28.041 --> 25:28.875
Hold here.

25:31.916 --> 25:34.208
No changes, physically or mentally?

25:34.291 --> 25:38.250
No, I really just want to know
what's wrong with me, and…

25:39.958 --> 25:41.083
make it stop.

25:41.791 --> 25:44.791
What you went through was very traumatic.

25:44.875 --> 25:47.791
The sooner you accept
that something like that changes you,

25:48.583 --> 25:50.166
the easier your life will become.

25:56.708 --> 25:57.541
Shit.

26:26.083 --> 26:29.041
Well, well, Odd.
What should I say about this?

26:34.041 --> 26:35.041
My condolences.

26:36.083 --> 26:36.958
Yeah.

26:41.375 --> 26:42.708
You're the boss now.

26:43.625 --> 26:46.333
But that's how
family dynasties work, right?

26:46.416 --> 26:50.708
You have to step up right away.
It happens all the time to my clients.

26:50.791 --> 26:52.000
You meet many people

26:52.083 --> 26:54.750
who have to take over the family business
when their parents die?

26:54.833 --> 26:56.833
Yeah, that's an ordinary Tuesday at work.

26:56.916 --> 26:58.583
-And bury them?
-You know what I say?

26:58.666 --> 27:00.458
"The customer doesn't give a shit."

27:01.000 --> 27:02.916
-No.
-For them, it's just business.

27:03.000 --> 27:07.791
No. Dad had a real and nice
and special bond with many…

27:07.875 --> 27:11.541
But a special bond is all about trust.

27:12.875 --> 27:15.541
And do you know
how you build trust with clients, Odd?

27:16.916 --> 27:18.000
Yeah?

27:18.083 --> 27:20.000
By offering them a discount.

27:20.083 --> 27:21.583
What do you mean, "discount"?

27:22.416 --> 27:25.083
I'd learn this pretty quickly,
if I were you.

27:25.166 --> 27:29.291
Unless your business has a large buffer
to lean on in the beginning, that is.

27:30.166 --> 27:31.000
Look.

27:32.666 --> 27:34.083
I'll see you in class.

27:43.041 --> 27:46.750
A SALES CLASS WITH MARTIN JETTLAND

28:08.041 --> 28:09.333
Shall we toast?

28:11.500 --> 28:14.916
Cheers to a painful time,

28:15.000 --> 28:16.958
but also a new time.

28:17.500 --> 28:19.375
Cheers to Arvid.

28:19.958 --> 28:24.458
And to the fifth generation
of Hallangen Funeral Parlor.

28:25.208 --> 28:27.125
-Yeah, cheers.
-Cheers.

28:27.208 --> 28:28.625
To Dad and Hallangen.

28:38.333 --> 28:39.875
Speaking of Dad.…

28:45.416 --> 28:47.583
I went to the bank today
to speak to Frode.

28:50.958 --> 28:51.791
Yeah.

28:52.458 --> 28:55.708
Yeah, really just to take care
of some formalities.

28:57.541 --> 29:00.958
Yeah, and Frode helped me out,
so that went well.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.333
Okay. That's good.

29:03.875 --> 29:09.125
I get nervous
as soon as I get a bill for 300 kroner.

29:11.458 --> 29:13.041
Do you have to chew so damn loudly?

29:14.208 --> 29:15.375
I'm sorry.

29:15.458 --> 29:17.166
Pasta is a slurpy kind of food.

29:24.500 --> 29:28.750
Yeah, and I met Jettland today,

29:28.833 --> 29:30.375
and had, amazingly enough…

29:33.875 --> 29:35.416
a pretty nice chat with him.

29:36.958 --> 29:38.083
That's pretty rare.

29:50.541 --> 29:52.083
Stop it!

29:58.125 --> 29:59.208
Whoa, I'm sorry.

30:02.958 --> 30:04.125
I just have to…

30:05.583 --> 30:06.416
I'm sorry.

30:31.000 --> 30:31.958
What the fuck?

30:42.125 --> 30:44.791
If you see my darkness in Live…

30:46.375 --> 30:47.916
You know what you have to do.

31:54.541 --> 31:55.791
Please!

31:56.375 --> 31:57.541
Shut up!

31:57.625 --> 32:00.708
-Madeleine?
-Can you make her be quiet?

32:00.791 --> 32:02.000
You have to calm down.

32:02.666 --> 32:04.041
I can't take it!

32:04.625 --> 32:07.000
-I can't take it.
-It's okay.

32:07.083 --> 32:08.458
I can't take it!

32:08.541 --> 32:10.208
-Can I please have some?
-No.

32:10.291 --> 32:12.500
I need to. I just need a little.

32:12.583 --> 32:14.375
-Please.
-But you said…

32:14.458 --> 32:16.250
Please, I just need a little.

32:16.333 --> 32:17.958
I just need a little blood.

32:42.666 --> 32:45.416
UNPAID!

32:54.083 --> 32:58.208
SOLTUN NURSING HOME

33:02.125 --> 33:06.375
Darling, people act strangely sometimes
when they're grieving.

33:06.458 --> 33:09.916
How about we just give her some time
until tomorrow, and then we'll see?

33:11.375 --> 33:12.416
Yeah.

33:13.458 --> 33:14.666
Okay, what is it?

33:16.125 --> 33:17.000
It's raining.

33:18.041 --> 33:19.291
Yeah, I can see that.

33:20.583 --> 33:23.541
So maybe we'll be busy this week.

33:24.166 --> 33:25.000
Huh?

33:26.833 --> 33:30.541
Old people don't handle
changes in weather so well.

33:30.625 --> 33:34.083
I'm not sure I follow, darling.

33:34.708 --> 33:36.875
It doesn't take more
than a little cold, really.

33:36.958 --> 33:38.375
Okay.

33:40.166 --> 33:43.541
If you weren't so darn cute,
you'd be really, really creepy.

33:46.666 --> 33:47.500
Nutcase.

33:50.125 --> 33:51.666
There are crazier people than me.

35:10.375 --> 35:11.291
Live?

35:11.375 --> 35:12.666
Hi, Margit.

35:13.958 --> 35:15.500
I'm just taking some samples.

35:16.291 --> 35:17.208
Now?

35:17.291 --> 35:18.916
Yes. Just sleep.

35:29.291 --> 35:31.458
Sorry for scaring you earlier today.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.375
You sweet thing.

35:33.458 --> 35:38.291
It takes more than that
to scare an old one like me, you know.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
But, hey?

35:46.375 --> 35:49.458
No blood sample without…

35:50.250 --> 35:51.875
Yes, of course.

35:52.416 --> 35:53.625
How about

35:54.500 --> 35:55.791
Martin Luther King,

35:57.291 --> 35:59.000
Gandhi, and Rosa Parks?

36:00.166 --> 36:03.750
Who do you kill,
who do you sleep with,

36:03.833 --> 36:06.583
and who… who do you marry?

36:07.041 --> 36:09.541
I'd for sure have to sleep with Gandhi.

36:12.416 --> 36:14.041
You'll feel a slight prick now.

36:17.458 --> 36:18.458
There.

39:06.958 --> 39:07.958
No, no.

39:08.041 --> 39:10.583
Margit? Margit, can you hear me?

39:13.833 --> 39:15.333
Margit, can you hear me?

39:18.291 --> 39:19.208
Oh no.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.125
Mrs. Gundersen!

40:10.833 --> 40:12.666
Shit!

40:41.500 --> 40:43.166
Our Father, who art in heaven,

40:43.750 --> 40:45.458
hallowed be thy name.

40:46.541 --> 40:48.083
Thy kingdom come,

40:49.166 --> 40:51.666
thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

40:52.958 --> 40:55.041
Give us this day our daily bread.

40:56.708 --> 40:58.166
Deliver us from evil.

40:58.791 --> 40:59.750
Amen.
