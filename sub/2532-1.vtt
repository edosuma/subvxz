03:31.850 --> 03:33.561
Hey, Sailor, wait!

03:37.105 --> 03:38.565
I got something for you.

03:40.234 --> 03:42.861
Marietta tells me you were trying to

03:43.278 --> 03:45.530
fuck her in the toilets.
- Oh, man...

03:45.946 --> 03:49.784
You crazy bad boy, trying to
fuck your girl's mama!

03:50.202 --> 03:55.248
Tell me: How does
that little cunt Lula feel about that?

03:55.665 --> 03:57.250
You know...

03:58.587 --> 04:00.963
Marietta gave me this
to kill you.

04:02.130 --> 04:03.965
And then she said
I'd be able to fuck Lula...

05:06.611 --> 05:10.324
PEE DEE PENITENTIARY

05:34.891 --> 05:39.104
22 MONTHS, 18 DAYS LATER

05:46.152 --> 05:48.195
Hello...?
- Is Lula there?

05:49.238 --> 05:50.322
Who is this?

05:50.991 --> 05:52.492
Sailor Ripley.

05:53.535 --> 05:56.705
Can I... talk to Lula?

05:58.081 --> 06:01.042
There's no way in hell!

06:01.460 --> 06:06.088
If you even think
about seeing Lula, you're dead. - What?

06:06.631 --> 06:11.511
You heard me.
And don't you ever call here again!

06:23.149 --> 06:24.191
Mama?

06:26.984 --> 06:28.321
You know who that was.

06:29.655 --> 06:31.782
And you know you aren't,

06:32.199 --> 06:35.661
and I mean are not
gonna see him ever.

06:36.077 --> 06:38.122
End of story!

06:39.499 --> 06:41.667
Like hell!

07:08.610 --> 07:09.986
Lula!

07:12.990 --> 07:14.951
Sailor!
- Peanut!

07:15.368 --> 07:16.869
Hey baby!

07:21.707 --> 07:24.126
I've got a surprise for you!

07:24.543 --> 07:28.672
Hey, my snakeskin jacket!
Thanks, baby! Did I ever tell you

07:29.090 --> 07:34.053
that this jacket is a symbol of my
belief in personal freedom?

07:34.470 --> 07:36.639
About 50,000 times.

07:37.056 --> 07:40.476
I got us a room at
the Cape Fear. And guess what?

07:40.894 --> 07:43.063
"Powermad" is at the "Hurricane"!

07:43.479 --> 07:44.563
Stab it and steer!

08:25.354 --> 08:30.276
Jeez Lou-eez, Sailor,
you are something else...

08:32.779 --> 08:36.408
When I was 15,
my mama told me

08:36.825 --> 08:39.495
that pretty soon
I'd be starting to think about sex,

08:39.913 --> 08:43.541
and that I should tell her before
I did anything about it.

08:43.957 --> 08:46.001
But I thought
you told me your uncle Pooch

08:46.417 --> 08:48.796
raped you
when you was 13?

08:50.380 --> 08:52.008
True.

08:52.424 --> 08:54.760
Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle.

08:55.177 --> 08:58.765
He was
a business partner of my daddy's.

09:00.558 --> 09:03.478
Mama never knew 'bout me and him...

09:03.895 --> 09:05.978
that's for damn sure.

09:07.397 --> 09:10.567
You know what?
You're a pumpkin.

09:23.748 --> 09:25.500
Oh, my God! Get out!

09:47.397 --> 09:49.773
Uncle Pooch died
in a car crash 3 months later,

09:50.190 --> 09:51.943
on holiday in Myrtle Beach.

09:52.902 --> 09:55.572
They still got
way too much traffic there.

09:55.989 --> 09:58.658
Have you been
noticin' the buildup in traffic?

09:59.076 --> 10:00.578
Here she goes again.

10:00.995 --> 10:02.037
I'm sorry, Sailor,

10:02.663 --> 10:06.166
but that ozone layer is disappearin'.

10:06.583 --> 10:08.502
One of these mornings, the sun's gonna

10:08.918 --> 10:12.630
burn a hole clean through the earth
like an electrical X-ray.

10:13.047 --> 10:14.507
That won't happen, honey.

10:15.008 --> 10:18.095
At least not in our lifetime.
And by then,

10:18.512 --> 10:20.763
they'll be driving Buicks to the moon.

10:33.486 --> 10:34.528
You OK, honey?

10:35.571 --> 10:38.699
That woman's laugh
creeps me out.

10:40.868 --> 10:43.288
Like something I've heard before.

10:45.165 --> 10:47.082
Sounded like the Wicked Witch.

10:47.499 --> 10:49.751
Just sounded like an old gal
having a good time to me.

10:50.169 --> 10:52.255
You ready to go dancing?

10:52.671 --> 10:55.090
I'm always ready to dance.

10:55.508 --> 10:59.595
But I need my kiss first.
Just one!

11:15.903 --> 11:21.868
I'm gonna hire me a hit man, if you
don't help me stop this thing.

11:24.328 --> 11:27.498
I'm going to call Marcello Santos.

11:30.501 --> 11:34.547
Marietta, I am gonna help you.

11:34.964 --> 11:37.258
So don't get carried away.

11:37.676 --> 11:40.554
You don't want
to bring Santos and his bunch into this.

11:41.096 --> 11:45.350
You're just jealous of him
'cause he's still sweet on me.

11:49.311 --> 11:50.897
You been seeing him again?

11:51.313 --> 11:53.399
Oh my God,

11:53.817 --> 11:55.652
I don't believe this!

11:56.653 --> 11:58.154
Johnnie Farragut...

11:59.406 --> 12:04.161
who doesn't even trust
his very own Marietta?

12:07.371 --> 12:10.416
Alright, I'm sorry honey, but...

12:12.252 --> 12:13.378
I just love you,

12:13.963 --> 12:16.464
and it just brings out...

12:16.882 --> 12:20.969
That ugly jealous side,
I hate it, God!

12:42.032 --> 12:44.242
No tongue! My lipstick.

12:46.119 --> 12:51.458
Sweetheart, I want you
to stop worrying about me,

12:51.875 --> 12:58.132
and start worryin' about
how to get Lula from that murderer.

12:58.549 --> 13:00.800
Honey, wait a minute now:

13:01.219 --> 13:03.011
Sailor ain't no murderer.

13:03.513 --> 13:06.806
Now listen to me!
You gotta get off that kick.

13:07.224 --> 13:12.020
As far as I know, Sailor was
all clean before he got involved in

13:12.437 --> 13:14.315
in that event with Lula.

13:14.732 --> 13:16.650
And even there,
he was trying to protect her.

13:17.068 --> 13:20.904
That crazy Bob Ray Lemon was
comin' at them with a knife.

13:21.322 --> 13:24.033
He could've killed both of them.
You oughtta be thankin' him!

13:24.451 --> 13:26.160
I don't know why I'm telling you this.

13:26.578 --> 13:29.497
You were there,
you saw the whole damned thing!

13:29.913 --> 13:31.249
Didn't you?

13:59.945 --> 14:01.822
Sailor boy!

14:10.788 --> 14:13.875
How'd you like

14:14.292 --> 14:16.837
to fuck Lula's mama?

14:17.420 --> 14:19.923
No... ma'am...

14:20.339 --> 14:26.430
I sure don't.
- Lula's mama would like to fuck you.

14:27.181 --> 14:32.644
Mrs. Fortune, I really think
you need a cup of coffee.

14:34.062 --> 14:37.231
Maybe I was there.

14:37.649 --> 14:40.276
But I didn't see anything at all.

14:40.694 --> 14:43.990
All I know is,
is that trash,

14:44.406 --> 14:47.366
he killed a man
with his bare hands,

14:47.783 --> 14:52.915
hands that are probably
all over my baby right now!

14:53.790 --> 14:56.335
Oh, honey, settle down.

14:59.379 --> 15:01.256
It's all right, come on now.

15:02.884 --> 15:03.968
It's alright.

15:04.384 --> 15:07.179
Now listen, I want
what's best for her too.

15:07.595 --> 15:11.725
I'll do everything I can
to bring her back home, OK?

15:31.578 --> 15:34.707
Baby, quit bouncing.
I got one more toe to do.

15:35.583 --> 15:37.710
Let's go dancing, Peanut!

15:38.126 --> 15:39.546
I'm ready.

15:41.798 --> 15:42.881
But we better be careful.

15:43.299 --> 15:47.387
Mama's gonna
have Johnnie Farragut after us.

15:47.804 --> 15:51.348
He's one clever detective.
You know how clever?

15:51.767 --> 15:53.851
How clever?
- He told me once,

15:54.269 --> 15:56.937
he could find
an honest man in Washington.

15:59.274 --> 16:04.279
I just want two more moments,
then my toes will be dry.

16:05.489 --> 16:08.658
One thing puzzles me, sugar.
- What's that?

16:09.074 --> 16:10.619
You're 20 years old.

16:11.161 --> 16:14.539
Ain't you ever curious as to why
your mama wants to keep us apart?

16:18.627 --> 16:20.629
I'll tell you, Lula...

16:24.383 --> 16:27.470
it's more than
me killing Bob Ray Lemon.

16:29.137 --> 16:33.683
Maybe my mama
cares for me just a little too much.

16:34.893 --> 16:36.437
Yeah, maybe.

16:39.814 --> 16:43.444
I just want
to kiss you goodbye.

16:43.860 --> 16:47.531
You know too much about Lula's Mama.

16:47.948 --> 16:49.532
What do you mean?

16:49.949 --> 16:54.955
Johnnie told me
you were a driver for Marcello Santos.

16:55.372 --> 16:58.583
So what?
- So maybe one night,

16:59.001 --> 17:00.877
you got too close to a fire.

17:02.630 --> 17:07.843
So maybe you're gonna burn.
Besides, you're shit.

17:08.675 --> 17:10.136
You think I'd let my little girl

17:10.553 --> 17:13.848
hang out with a piece
of s-h-i-t like you?

17:14.266 --> 17:18.645
Kid, you belong
in one of these toilets!

17:20.564 --> 17:25.653
You piece of white trash!

17:26.070 --> 17:27.239
You...

17:34.495 --> 17:37.081
You're gonna have to kill me
to keep me away from Lula.

17:37.497 --> 17:42.128
Don't worry about that.
First I'm gonna cut your balls off

17:42.545 --> 17:44.213
and feed them to you.

17:47.342 --> 17:49.426
You're gonna have to kill me.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.430
I can arrange that.

17:56.059 --> 17:59.186
It's a problem I don't think
is gonna go away too soon.

18:00.229 --> 18:04.526
I'm ready to break parole
and take you out to sunny California!

18:04.944 --> 18:08.030
Sailor!
- You up for that?

18:08.697 --> 18:11.448
I'd go to the far end
of the world for you, baby.

18:11.866 --> 18:13.326
You know that.

18:14.076 --> 18:16.120
Rockin' good news!

18:20.834 --> 18:23.587
Are those toenails about dry yet,
sweetheart?

18:24.004 --> 18:26.006
We've got some dancing to do!

19:21.728 --> 19:24.525
You gonna give me the
opportunity to prove my love to my girl?

19:25.233 --> 19:30.737
Or you gonna save yourself
some trouble and apologize to her?

19:32.615 --> 19:35.034
Don't fuck with me, man.

19:41.458 --> 19:43.626
You look like a clown
in that stupid jacket.

19:44.085 --> 19:46.380
This is a snakeskin jacket...

19:46.796 --> 19:49.465
It's a symbol of my individuality

19:49.882 --> 19:52.802
and my belief
in personal freedom.

19:55.137 --> 19:56.347
Asshole!

19:58.182 --> 20:00.726
Come here!
- Sailor, honey...

20:04.814 --> 20:08.110
I'm sorry to do this to you
here in front of a crowd and all...

20:08.527 --> 20:10.820
But I want you to get up
and apologize to my girl.

20:18.203 --> 20:19.620
I'm sorry.

20:20.998 --> 20:25.544
You just bumped against
the wrong girl, that's all.

20:27.546 --> 20:29.464
Get yourself a beer.

20:30.590 --> 20:33.341
You fellas have
a lot of the same power "E" had.

20:33.759 --> 20:35.469
Do you know this one?

22:53.650 --> 22:58.157
Sail', how come you didn't
sing me "Love me tender"?

22:58.990 --> 23:01.659
You told me
that was your favorite love song.

23:02.076 --> 23:06.458
I told you I'd only sing
"Love me tender" to my wife.

23:29.021 --> 23:31.732
Did you ever think something...

23:32.775 --> 23:34.985
you can hear a wind...

23:36.028 --> 23:38.864
and see the Wicked Witch of the East
come flyin' in?

23:45.746 --> 23:48.375
I really did miss your mind
while I was out at Pee Dee.

23:49.668 --> 23:51.836
The rest of your too, of course.

23:52.252 --> 23:56.173
But the way your head works
is God's mystery.

23:57.216 --> 23:58.509
What were you thinking?

24:02.596 --> 24:05.809
Well, I was thinking
about smoking, actually.

24:06.935 --> 24:09.604
My mama smokes Merits now.

24:10.021 --> 24:12.773
She used to smoke Viceroys.

24:13.398 --> 24:16.235
I started stealing
'em from her about 6th grade.

24:17.152 --> 24:19.655
When did you start smoking, Sail'?

24:21.740 --> 24:24.452
I started when I was about...

24:25.495 --> 24:27.039
four.

24:28.498 --> 24:31.167
My mom was already
dead then from lung cancer.

24:31.835 --> 24:36.130
What brand did she smoke?
- Marlboros, same as me.

24:36.715 --> 24:39.216
I guess both my mom
and my daddy died

24:39.634 --> 24:41.678
of smoke
or alcohol related illness.

24:42.220 --> 24:45.098
Jeez, Sail', I'm sorry.
- Its OK, honey.

24:46.099 --> 24:48.685
I hardly used to see them anyways.

24:49.102 --> 24:52.480
I didn't have much
parental guidance.

24:52.898 --> 24:56.901
The public defender
kept saying that.

24:58.613 --> 25:01.699
He was a good ol' boy,
he stood by me.

25:03.241 --> 25:07.078
I'd stand by you, Sail',

25:07.497 --> 25:08.956
through anything.

25:10.124 --> 25:11.875
Hell, Peanut...

25:14.586 --> 25:20.510
You stuck by me after
I planted Bob Ray Lemon.

25:20.926 --> 25:23.762
A man can't ask for more than that.

25:26.432 --> 25:28.226
You move me, Sail'.

25:29.268 --> 25:31.145
You really do.

25:32.438 --> 25:35.525
You mark me the deepest.

25:41.822 --> 25:44.158
You're perfect for me too.

25:47.829 --> 25:50.873
You remind me of my daddy.

25:52.584 --> 25:54.252
Mama told me
he liked skinny women

25:54.668 --> 25:57.587
with breasts
that stood up and said "Hello".

26:01.634 --> 26:05.054
He had a long nose too,
just like yours.

26:07.098 --> 26:10.435
Did I ever tell you
how my daddy died?

26:11.436 --> 26:13.938
In a fire, as I recall.

26:14.729 --> 26:15.939
Yeah...

26:16.898 --> 26:20.903
Mama told me he poured
kerosene all over himself,

26:22.239 --> 26:24.574
and lit a match.

26:46.138 --> 26:49.266
That was the year
before I met you.

27:14.041 --> 27:15.792
No, I haven't found them yet.

27:16.209 --> 27:19.923
Just try to take it easy.
- Johnnie!

27:20.339 --> 27:23.926
I'm going to stay
right here, by this telephone,

27:24.343 --> 27:27.721
until you find Lula.
And then I'm coming to get her.

27:28.137 --> 27:30.725
So call me the second
you get to New Orleans.

27:31.141 --> 27:33.936
I will, honey.
- Please don't let me down again!

27:34.352 --> 27:37.272
I'll miss you.
- Get going! - OK. Bye.

27:37.690 --> 27:39.650
Bye, honey.

27:58.753 --> 28:01.588
Well, I guess you
broke parole now.

28:02.005 --> 28:03.508
You guess?

28:03.925 --> 28:08.721
My parole was broke 200 miles back,
when we burned Portagee County.

28:14.184 --> 28:17.396
I guess I'll send Mama
a postcard from somewhere.

28:17.813 --> 28:20.566
I don't want
her to worry more than necessary.

28:21.568 --> 28:24.362
That's not why I
called you here, Santos.

28:25.071 --> 28:26.656
That don't smell like a Kool.

28:27.073 --> 28:30.743
It ain't.
It's part of the lessons of life.

28:31.870 --> 28:33.954
Just tell me what you want.

28:34.372 --> 28:39.752
You ain't gonna start worrying
about what's bad for you?

28:40.170 --> 28:45.216
I mean, here you are, crossing
state lines with a real murderer...

28:45.633 --> 28:49.138
A manslaughterer, honey,
not murderer. Don't exaggerate.

28:49.555 --> 28:51.806
OK, manslaughterer...

28:52.224 --> 28:57.479
who just broke parole and has only
immoral purposes in mind,

28:57.896 --> 29:00.857
as far as you're concerned.
- Thank the Lord!

29:01.274 --> 29:03.902
Well, you ain't
let me down yet... Sail'.

29:04.319 --> 29:08.282
That's more than
I can say for the rest of the world.

29:08.698 --> 29:11.701
You please me too, Peanut

29:13.496 --> 29:19.000
You want me to shoot
Sailor in the brains, with a gun.

29:20.001 --> 29:21.085
Yes.

29:22.922 --> 29:25.716
In the forehead?
- Yes.

29:26.133 --> 29:27.760
Wrong!

29:28.427 --> 29:32.265
It's always better to blow a hole
through the back of the head.

29:32.681 --> 29:34.059
Right through...

29:34.474 --> 29:36.518
to the nose.

29:38.686 --> 29:41.358
Lots of irreparable damage.

29:44.360 --> 29:45.903
See?

29:46.737 --> 29:49.156
I knew
you had it under control.

29:49.573 --> 29:53.161
You are a little slow, but
you're beginning to get it.

29:55.120 --> 29:58.624
Why didn't you send
Johnnie Farragut?

29:59.042 --> 30:00.292
Maybe I did.

30:02.878 --> 30:05.506
Why don't you
look in New Orleans?

30:05.923 --> 30:09.845
Lula always talks about that town.
- On one condition:

30:12.138 --> 30:14.682
You give me permission
to kill Johnnie Farragut.

30:15.099 --> 30:16.893
Santos, please!

30:17.852 --> 30:19.895
You're not telling me
you're that sweet on him?

30:20.396 --> 30:22.273
What? No...
- Are you that sweet on him?

30:22.690 --> 30:25.527
No, but...
- One day he's gonna find out

30:25.944 --> 30:29.698
what we're up to with Mr. Reindeer,
and he can cause us a lot of trouble.

30:33.828 --> 30:35.787
I'll take your silence as a "yes".

30:36.203 --> 30:39.623
No... no, Santos...
- Shhh, it's OK.

30:40.041 --> 30:42.377
It's alright.
- No! You're not gonna kill him!

30:43.253 --> 30:46.464
You're not gonna kill him!
- No, no...

30:48.341 --> 30:52.638
No, not Johnnie.
You kill Sailor!

30:53.514 --> 30:56.766
I am going to kill Sailor.

30:57.641 --> 31:00.061
You can be certain of that.

31:15.910 --> 31:19.080
Hello, Mr. Reindeer.
Marcello Santos speaking.

31:20.499 --> 31:25.003
Mr. Marcello Santos. Hey there!

31:26.046 --> 31:28.882
That was great shit
you sent last in last month.

31:31.927 --> 31:33.721
I've got a problem.

31:34.804 --> 31:36.932
A couple of problems, in fact.

31:37.390 --> 31:39.518
A couple of problems?

31:40.560 --> 31:45.566
For each problem, drop a
silver dollar through my mail slot.

31:45.983 --> 31:47.652
With all particulars.

31:48.653 --> 31:51.780
We'll work out
"il conto" later.

31:52.907 --> 31:55.159
Have a beautiful day!

32:04.418 --> 32:06.212
We are.

32:26.190 --> 32:29.652
Keep them panties up,
we're in Jimmy Swaggart country!

32:52.425 --> 32:53.593
You know what?

32:54.011 --> 32:57.471
That little bitch Susie
stole my comb.

32:58.931 --> 33:00.725
I hate that.

33:01.142 --> 33:02.935
The stupid little shit!

33:03.353 --> 33:04.855
Phone's ringing.

33:14.991 --> 33:16.034
Juana.

33:16.449 --> 33:20.077
A couple of silver dollars
came my way today.

33:20.495 --> 33:24.248
I'm sending one to you,
with a paper on the beneficiary.

33:24.666 --> 33:28.128
As usual, you are completely free
to fulfill the obligation

33:28.545 --> 33:31.716
in any manner you so desire.

33:32.382 --> 33:35.219
In fact, send
Reggie and Drop Shadow over,

33:35.636 --> 33:37.553
for the silver dollar
and the papers.

33:37.971 --> 33:39.097
Now.

33:39.515 --> 33:45.186
They're on their way.
Who's getting' the second silver dollar?

33:45.604 --> 33:47.188
That's for me to know.

33:47.607 --> 33:49.107
Yeah?

33:50.150 --> 33:51.861
Thanks, Mr. Reindeer.

33:52.277 --> 33:55.447
Have fun, darling.

34:11.380 --> 34:12.882
How you doin', my boy?

35:12.108 --> 35:17.072
Sometimes, when we're making love,

35:17.489 --> 35:22.576
you just about take me
right over that rainbow.

35:22.994 --> 35:27.707
You're so aware of what goes on in me,
I mean, you pay attention.

35:28.125 --> 35:31.544
And I swear, baby,
you got the sweetest cock.

35:31.961 --> 35:36.467
It's like it's talking to me
when you're inside.

35:38.218 --> 35:40.470
You get right on me.

35:42.097 --> 35:46.060
You are dangerously cute, baby,
I got to admit it.

35:49.271 --> 35:52.359
Let's go out
into the crazy world of New Orleans!

35:53.484 --> 35:56.737
Let's get a fried banana sandwich.

36:06.329 --> 36:09.876
That's about the cutest
thing I've ever seen.

36:48.164 --> 36:53.503
Pigeons spread diseases and
mess up the place. You've seen it.

37:15.984 --> 37:17.569
The big N.O.!

37:20.614 --> 37:23.074
Santos? I don't know...

37:24.826 --> 37:27.203
I'm having second thoughts.

37:27.621 --> 37:29.956
Guess what?

37:30.373 --> 37:34.002
There's no turnin' back,
remember?

37:34.836 --> 37:38.673
I'm in a killing mood.
- Santos!

37:39.090 --> 37:44.221
I saw your boyfriend on Bourbon Street.
- I'm not sure...

37:44.803 --> 37:47.725
What? Are you in New Orleans?

37:48.141 --> 37:50.227
Crazy fucking bitch!

38:18.256 --> 38:19.714
Ladies!

38:20.131 --> 38:22.134
What are you?

38:22.802 --> 38:26.055
You're not just a pretty face
with a fucking smile.

38:26.472 --> 38:28.640
You're here
to make Mr. Reindeer happy.

38:29.058 --> 38:31.102
And to show him a good time.

38:32.103 --> 38:36.065
Do not bring misfortune
upon yourselves.

38:56.253 --> 38:57.546
When I gave you
the silver dollar, I forgot

38:57.963 --> 39:00.715
to include
the contents of this envelope.

39:01.132 --> 39:03.092
They are to be returned.

39:04.803 --> 39:08.723
Show it just before the deed.

40:24.801 --> 40:28.763
I knew I had an important lesson
to learn that day.

40:29.179 --> 40:33.643
When she got to the top step,
I stuck my hand between her legs.

40:34.060 --> 40:37.564
Baby, what a bad boy you are!

40:39.065 --> 40:41.400
Baby, what a bad boy you are!

40:42.527 --> 40:44.445
That's just what she said.

40:45.280 --> 40:49.742
I had a boner with a capital "O".

40:50.325 --> 40:52.245
Anyway, I found her lying

40:52.663 --> 40:56.207
in a room filled with
guns and porno magazines.

40:56.624 --> 41:00.211
So, I slid
my hand between her legs again,

41:01.254 --> 41:03.464
and she closed her thighs.

41:03.881 --> 41:05.425
You're exciting me, honey.

41:05.841 --> 41:07.718
Then what did she do?

41:08.136 --> 41:11.473
Her face was
half pushed into the pillow,

41:11.890 --> 41:16.686
and I remember, she looked back
over her shoulder at me and said:

41:17.104 --> 41:19.940
"I won't suck you.
Don't ask me to suck you."

41:20.356 --> 41:22.858
Poor baby, she doesn't know
what she missed.

41:23.276 --> 41:26.488
What color hair did she have?
- Jet black,

41:27.114 --> 41:28.907
but gentlemen prefer blondes.

41:29.325 --> 41:31.618
Anyway, dig this:

41:32.035 --> 41:33.703
She turns over,

41:34.747 --> 41:37.791
peels off them orange pants,

41:38.209 --> 41:41.585
spreads her legs
real wide

41:42.003 --> 41:45.466
and says to me:
"Take a bite of peach."

41:45.882 --> 41:50.887
Jesus, honey, you more than
sort of got what you come for.

41:53.599 --> 41:56.477
Baby, you better run me
back to the hotel.

41:56.894 --> 41:59.897
You've got me hotter
than Georgia asphalt.

42:00.314 --> 42:02.274
Say no more,
but go easy on me, sweetheart,

42:02.690 --> 42:05.194
tomorrow we got
a lot of driving to do.

42:09.281 --> 42:11.243
Hotter than Georgia asphalt.

43:26.400 --> 43:31.698
Wouldn't it be fabulous
if we someway stayed in love forever?

43:33.826 --> 43:38.164
You think of the weirdest damn things
to say sometimes, Peanut.

43:38.581 --> 43:41.957
Ain't we been
doing a pretty fair job thus far?

43:42.375 --> 43:46.128
Oh, you know exactly
what I mean, sugar.

43:46.546 --> 43:51.218
It'd make the future so simple and nice.

43:51.636 --> 43:53.094
I've done a few things

43:55.055 --> 43:57.725
in my life
which I ain't too proud of.

43:58.142 --> 44:04.063
But from now on I ain't
gonna do nothin' for no good reason.

44:04.482 --> 44:07.275
All I know for sure is
there's more than a few bad ideas

44:07.693 --> 44:09.236
runnin' loose out there.

44:13.950 --> 44:17.662
There's something
I ain't never told you about.

44:20.081 --> 44:24.335
This here's a story with a lesson
about bad ideas.

44:24.751 --> 44:25.836
What's that?

44:26.254 --> 44:31.050
Well, my cousin Dell was
always fighting bad ideas.

44:31.468 --> 44:35.471
See, Dell loved Christmas.
We used to call him

44:35.888 --> 44:37.306
"Jingle Dell".

44:37.723 --> 44:40.435
He wanted
Christmas to last all year long.

44:40.853 --> 44:44.896
He sure would scream
when his mom told him it was summer,

44:45.314 --> 44:48.359
and Christmas was
six months off.

44:51.153 --> 44:52.655
Also, he said...

44:54.740 --> 44:58.871
he felt there's men

44:59.288 --> 45:02.622
with black rubber gloves who were
following him around.

45:03.707 --> 45:07.545
Dell said that trust in the spirit of
Christmas was destroyed

45:07.962 --> 45:13.134
by ideas being controlled
by aliens wearing black gloves.

45:13.551 --> 45:17.471
These aliens would get Dell
to do all kinds of things.

45:18.056 --> 45:21.392
Then he'd carry on about the weather,

45:21.810 --> 45:26.190
talk about how rainfall is
controlled by aliens on earth.

45:26.898 --> 45:30.526
Aunt Rootie told him
that one day he would realize

45:30.943 --> 45:34.573
that the alien wearing
the black gloves was him,

45:34.990 --> 45:36.909
and him alone.

45:40.244 --> 45:45.083
Sounds like old Dell
was more than just a bit confused.

45:47.585 --> 45:49.921
Dell was learning a hard lesson.

45:50.339 --> 45:54.218
It got so he would stay up
all night making sandwiches.

45:56.053 --> 45:57.679
Dell, what are you doing?

46:06.145 --> 46:08.066
I'm making my lunch!

46:09.733 --> 46:13.487
Mama told me
Aunt Rootie, that's Dell's mama,

46:16.031 --> 46:18.660
found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.

46:20.244 --> 46:22.913
One time, she found Dell

46:23.329 --> 46:26.083
putting one big cockroach
on his anus.

46:26.500 --> 46:28.335
Hell, Peanut!

46:34.342 --> 46:36.511
It ain't so funny now, though.

46:38.011 --> 46:39.972
Dell disappeared.

46:40.390 --> 46:42.350
Nobody's seen him since.

46:44.393 --> 46:47.689
Too bad he couldn't visit

46:48.105 --> 46:52.360
that old Wizard of Oz,

46:53.403 --> 46:55.738
and get some good advice.

46:57.615 --> 47:00.368
Too bad
we all can't, baby.

47:17.926 --> 47:20.181
Are you there, Johnnie?

47:20.598 --> 47:22.765
What's wrong, honey?

47:28.606 --> 47:32.108
Johnnie, sweetheart.
Wait, I've got something to tell you.

47:32.525 --> 47:36.238
I want you to know something.

47:36.654 --> 47:39.491
I've done something so bad,
real bad.

47:39.908 --> 47:43.785
What?
- Not on the phone! No...

47:44.204 --> 47:48.124
I'm coming to New Orleans tomorrow
to tell you in person. OK?

47:48.542 --> 47:53.421
Don't do this to me. You'd freak out
if I did that to you. Now what is it?

47:55.174 --> 47:57.343
No,
I'm not gonna tell you on the phone.

47:57.760 --> 48:01.055
But honey, I gotta leave right now
and get on their trail.

48:01.472 --> 48:05.226
The kids were here. They checked
out of the Hotel Brazil this morning.

48:05.767 --> 48:07.477
No!

48:07.894 --> 48:09.938
Stay right there! Don't go anywhere!

48:10.356 --> 48:12.983
I'm coming in on Piedmont
tomorrow, on the 7 o'clock flight.

48:13.984 --> 48:19.949
We're going after Lula together!
- OK, if that's what you want.

48:20.367 --> 48:22.368
But I'm against it!

48:23.868 --> 48:25.495
7 o'clock,

48:25.912 --> 48:27.872
tomorrow evening. Sugar...

48:28.290 --> 48:30.793
We'll have dinner at our
favorite French restaurant, OK?

48:31.210 --> 48:34.630
You fix it up. OK, bye now?

48:35.673 --> 48:37.216
I love you.

48:39.343 --> 48:40.846
Marietta?

49:56.755 --> 49:59.258
How much we got left, baby?

49:59.675 --> 50:01.344
Under 100.

50:01.761 --> 50:03.804
You want me to drive

50:04.221 --> 50:08.225
so you can get a bit of rest?
- Yeah, that'd be good.

50:25.325 --> 50:29.579
Come in, San Antonio, Texas.
What's on your mind this evening?

50:30.038 --> 50:32.707
I just had triple bypass,
open-heart surgery,

50:33.125 --> 50:36.963
and it's people like you who make me
wanna get out of the hospital...

50:37.380 --> 50:39.923
How can anyone listen to this crap?

50:40.674 --> 50:43.970
...for her recent divorce, shot
her three children, aged seven...

50:45.596 --> 50:46.638
A judge

50:47.055 --> 50:49.976
praised defendant John Roy,
but was dismayed to learn

50:50.393 --> 50:52.770
that he'd had sex with the corpse.

50:53.229 --> 50:54.480
What?

50:56.148 --> 50:58.901
State authorities, last October
released 500 turtles ino the Ganges,

50:59.319 --> 51:01.654
to try and reduce human pollution,

51:02.072 --> 51:05.156
and will now use crocodiles to eat
corpses dumped by poor Hindus...

51:05.574 --> 51:10.455
Holy shit!
It's Night of the Living Dead!

51:11.497 --> 51:14.709
What's that, Peanut?
- I can't take any more of this radio!

51:15.126 --> 51:18.005
I've never heard
so much shit in all my life!

51:18.421 --> 51:22.800
Sailor Ripley, you get me
some music now! I mean it!

51:23.218 --> 51:25.928
...victim of a sexual assault...
...mutilated... raped...

52:48.428 --> 52:52.516
Johnnie, I can't tell you now,
honey, but listen:

52:52.932 --> 52:57.104
Is there any way, any way
that we could get on the road tonight?

52:57.522 --> 53:02.902
Something was upsetting you bad
last night when you called.

53:03.319 --> 53:05.656
And you wanted to tell me.

53:06.071 --> 53:09.741
So I figured that you
wanted me to help you.

53:11.035 --> 53:12.328
I did.

53:13.246 --> 53:16.624
Oh, I did.
But that was last night.

53:17.040 --> 53:20.962
Now I need your help. We have to
find Lula before it's too late.

53:21.714 --> 53:24.799
Honey, I have to ask you something.
- Okay.

53:26.593 --> 53:29.345
Is Santos
involved in this in any way?

53:32.848 --> 53:34.225
Hell no!

53:35.226 --> 53:39.022
Do you think I would do something
like that without coming to you?

53:40.773 --> 53:42.568
I'm sorry, honey.

53:44.652 --> 53:48.865
Goddamned Pucinski, son of a bitch!
- Who, Uncle Pooch?

53:49.282 --> 53:52.785
The son of a bitch who introduced
Santos to you and Clyde.

53:53.660 --> 53:55.079
Johnnie...

53:56.332 --> 53:58.250
That's all the past.

53:59.126 --> 54:02.879
Now what you and I have to do...

54:03.506 --> 54:06.299
is think about our future.

54:08.092 --> 54:09.344
Do you mean that?

54:11.429 --> 54:14.058
You bet your sweet ass I do!

54:15.517 --> 54:16.852
Gosh.

54:18.354 --> 54:21.190
Did I tell you
how great it was to see you again?

54:23.692 --> 54:25.611
Just about five times, that's all.

54:34.078 --> 54:37.413
Oh God, Johnnie, I love you!
- I love you too.

54:37.832 --> 54:43.088
Let's get our backsides
out of this town and go get my Lula!

55:11.615 --> 55:13.659
What's troublin' you, sugar?

55:17.580 --> 55:19.498
You know, Lula...

55:19.916 --> 55:23.086
I never told you what all
I was doing before I met you.

55:23.503 --> 55:28.299
I just figured
you were out being Mr. Cool.

55:28.716 --> 55:30.634
Not exactly, sugar.

55:31.051 --> 55:37.308
One reason we're in this trouble
is because of what I was doing.

55:37.726 --> 55:40.186
I tried to tell you this before.

55:41.062 --> 55:43.315
You're scaring me, baby.

55:43.900 --> 55:47.318
Well, there's a good side
as well as a bad side to it.

55:48.360 --> 55:52.072
The good side is that I knew
your daddy. Clyde was a good guy.

55:52.490 --> 55:55.493
You knew my daddy?
- Yes.

55:56.536 --> 55:58.329
I sure did.

55:59.456 --> 56:01.041
The bad side of it...

56:01.667 --> 56:04.544
is I did some driving
for a man named Marcello Santos.

56:04.961 --> 56:06.630
Oh Shit.

56:08.340 --> 56:09.591
I quit working for him,

56:10.008 --> 56:13.136
but just before I did,
I ended up one night at a house.

56:13.553 --> 56:15.347
I didn't know it then,

56:15.764 --> 56:17.849
but it was your house.

56:19.017 --> 56:21.895
I don't know
what they think I saw that night.

56:22.312 --> 56:25.734
I was just sitting out in the car,
'til the whole place went up in flames.

56:28.652 --> 56:33.031
Oh God, Sailor,
that's the night my daddy died!

56:34.408 --> 56:35.951
I know, sugar.

56:42.374 --> 56:43.585
Daddy?

56:47.879 --> 56:49.422
That's...

56:50.465 --> 56:54.554
some big secret
you've been carrying, Sail'.

56:55.637 --> 56:57.931
We all got
a secret side, baby.

56:58.974 --> 57:02.645
I hope you don't think
I been lyin' to you about other things.

57:32.091 --> 57:34.302
Lula, you there?

57:35.888 --> 57:37.597
Yeah, I'm here...

57:42.727 --> 57:44.020
You upset with me?

57:45.564 --> 57:48.441
It just shocking sometimes...

57:49.859 --> 57:52.862
when things aren't
what you thought they were.

58:06.835 --> 58:09.545
We're really
in the middle of it now, ain't we?

58:35.739 --> 58:40.327
I'm gonna pack real fast,
then I'll meet you downstairs.

58:40.744 --> 58:44.831
My God, what we could've done
on that kingsize bed tonight!

58:45.249 --> 58:49.043
Don't worry, I'll make up for it!
- Alright.

58:54.006 --> 58:56.301
See you in a minute.
- Okay.

58:58.178 --> 58:59.639
Marietta...

59:36.258 --> 59:37.968
What's that?

59:39.597 --> 59:42.390
I don't know...
Looks like clothes.

01:00:04.204 --> 01:00:05.623
Oh God, Sailor!

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:08.125
One bad car accident.

01:00:50.625 --> 01:00:51.752
What should we do?

01:00:52.169 --> 01:00:54.880
I don't know, but we got to
help that girl, get her to a town,

01:00:55.297 --> 01:00:58.801
and hope nobody finds out
that I broke parole.

01:01:02.054 --> 01:01:03.681
This bobby pin...

01:01:06.307 --> 01:01:07.561
I can't find it.

01:01:07.978 --> 01:01:10.813
My mother's gonna kill me...
...it's got all my cards...

01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:12.480
It was in my pocket.

01:01:12.898 --> 01:01:16.235
Now my pocket's gone.
Gotta help me find it...

01:01:17.486 --> 01:01:22.658
All my cards...
and it was in my pocket, and...

01:01:24.744 --> 01:01:31.000
My purse is gone!
Now she tells me!

01:01:31.416 --> 01:01:33.501
Let's get a hold of her!
- Is she going to make it?

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:36.505
Don't know, but she's gonna
bleed all over our car!

01:01:36.923 --> 01:01:39.550
Hey... hello! Girl!

01:01:40.593 --> 01:01:42.554
Come with us, honey!

01:01:42.971 --> 01:01:44.723
Leave me alone!

01:01:49.686 --> 01:01:51.813
Robert?

01:01:52.647 --> 01:01:54.315
Robert!

01:01:58.652 --> 01:01:59.821
Shit.

01:02:00.655 --> 01:02:03.909
Got this damned
sticky stuff in my hair...

01:02:07.077 --> 01:02:09.498
...got sticky stuff in my hair.

01:02:09.956 --> 01:02:12.166
Better come with us, honey. Come on!

01:02:12.584 --> 01:02:16.086
Gotta find my wallet...
Don't tell my mother, please.

01:02:16.504 --> 01:02:18.089
God, she's gonna kill me!

01:02:18.507 --> 01:02:20.592
Can't worry about that...

01:02:22.469 --> 01:02:26.516
Where's my hairbrush?
- God, she's dying right in front of us.

01:02:35.147 --> 01:02:37.442
Get my lipstick...

01:02:39.528 --> 01:02:41.656
It's in my purse.

01:02:44.783 --> 01:02:47.078
She died
right in front of us, Sailor...

01:02:47.495 --> 01:02:49.664
Why'd she have to go and do that?

01:02:52.666 --> 01:02:54.544
Let's get outta here, honey.

01:03:07.348 --> 01:03:09.350
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

01:04:05.782 --> 01:04:08.785
I don't understand this one tiny bit.

01:04:09.203 --> 01:04:13.372
See, he told me to wait
for him here in that lobby there.

01:04:13.789 --> 01:04:19.378
What I feel is that something
terrible has happened to him.

01:04:21.131 --> 01:04:24.301
Perhaps we should
call a local law enforcement officer?

01:04:24.718 --> 01:04:26.637
No, please! Please no!

01:04:27.054 --> 01:04:31.100
The last thing I need
is some damned policeman

01:04:31.516 --> 01:04:33.226
moving and going around here...

01:04:33.643 --> 01:04:37.355
No, I just can't...
no... no.

01:04:39.399 --> 01:04:42.778
I am sorry...
I must have overlooked this.

01:04:43.195 --> 01:04:45.948
I'm truly
'
sorry, ma am.

01:04:59.503 --> 01:05:00.754
What?

01:05:03.924 --> 01:05:05.343
Could you...?

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:10.765
"Gone fishing with a friend...

01:05:12.056 --> 01:05:15.645
and maybe buffalo hunting, too."

01:05:16.144 --> 01:05:17.563
Buffalo hunting?

01:05:18.355 --> 01:05:20.107
"I've gone buffalo hunting."?

01:05:21.901 --> 01:05:25.697
What the fuck
does "Buffalo hunting" mean?

01:05:27.030 --> 01:05:28.949
Well, I am sure
I wouldn't know, I mean...

01:05:29.367 --> 01:05:31.327
My God...

01:05:32.370 --> 01:05:34.121
He's afraid.

01:05:36.498 --> 01:05:38.333
He's done it again!

01:05:38.751 --> 01:05:40.210
The fucker split!

01:05:42.338 --> 01:05:44.966
"I've made a commitment."

01:05:45.675 --> 01:05:46.718
Marietta!

01:05:48.511 --> 01:05:49.804
Santos!

01:05:50.347 --> 01:05:53.932
Gentlemen, I'd like
to take this opportunity to ask you:

01:05:54.642 --> 01:05:58.104
Please, clear out!
- How rude!

01:05:59.230 --> 01:06:01.232
Me too?
- Yeah, you too.

01:06:14.036 --> 01:06:17.916
What did you do to Johnnie?
Where's Johnnie?

01:06:18.958 --> 01:06:20.210
What's happening here?

01:06:20.627 --> 01:06:24.757
Tell me what's happening here!
Santos, tell me!

01:06:25.174 --> 01:06:26.967
You been crying?

01:06:28.885 --> 01:06:31.971
You gotta cut out
this crybaby stuff, you know?

01:06:33.223 --> 01:06:36.059
You're my girl now, and Santos...

01:06:37.101 --> 01:06:38.437
Santos...

01:06:40.855 --> 01:06:43.359
Santos wants to wipe away the tears,

01:06:45.152 --> 01:06:46.946
and make you happy.

01:06:49.406 --> 01:06:51.700
I want you to tell me...

01:06:52.327 --> 01:06:54.494
I want you to tell me...

01:06:54.911 --> 01:06:58.581
Did you do anything to Johnnie?
Did you hurt him? I want to know.

01:06:59.375 --> 01:07:03.003
I did not do anything
to Johnnie Farragut.

01:07:04.046 --> 01:07:06.506
You swear, on your mother?

01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:12.804
I swear. On my mother.
- God! Oh God!

01:07:13.222 --> 01:07:14.848
Come on. We have to go.

01:07:15.266 --> 01:07:17.434
I got word:

01:07:17.852 --> 01:07:19.436
The kids are moving through Texas.

01:07:19.854 --> 01:07:23.649
And I think a happy end
is being arranged there.

01:07:24.692 --> 01:07:27.153
That's it, give me a smile!

01:07:29.739 --> 01:07:31.323
Oh Santos.

01:07:33.993 --> 01:07:37.080
You're the only one

01:07:37.496 --> 01:07:40.040
that always came through for me.

01:07:53.387 --> 01:07:58.350
I smell your shit now, Johnnie.
Give us one more kiss, Reggie!

01:08:00.269 --> 01:08:01.813
Oh, fuck me!

01:08:04.441 --> 01:08:05.734
Fuck me!

01:08:06.693 --> 01:08:07.986
Fuck me!

01:08:28.089 --> 01:08:30.216
We hunt buffalo now.

01:08:30.635 --> 01:08:32.553
Can't wait no more!

01:08:41.310 --> 01:08:45.189
Remember the number... ten!

01:08:46.442 --> 01:08:49.278
I can't stop her, Johnnie.

01:08:50.237 --> 01:08:55.576
But I gonna be standing behind you
with this big old gun!

01:08:58.495 --> 01:09:00.497
It's a Marine issue!

01:09:08.214 --> 01:09:09.756
I go out now...

01:09:15.429 --> 01:09:16.846
Reggie!
- Yes?

01:09:18.055 --> 01:09:19.765
Show him now!

01:09:25.273 --> 01:09:26.898
Honey...

01:09:28.568 --> 01:09:30.362
I forget to show you this!

01:09:31.238 --> 01:09:32.863
Santos?

01:09:34.282 --> 01:09:36.658
Oh God, Marietta, honey...

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.142
One...

01:10:01.559 --> 01:10:04.061
Bye now!
- Two...

01:10:05.105 --> 01:10:07.316
three... four...

01:10:07.732 --> 01:10:09.985
Gettin' too hot now, Reggie!

01:10:10.401 --> 01:10:12.112
Five...

01:10:12.528 --> 01:10:13.780
...feeling myself...

01:10:14.488 --> 01:10:15.531
six...

01:10:17.033 --> 01:10:18.075
seven...

01:10:18.492 --> 01:10:19.535
eight...

01:10:20.161 --> 01:10:21.204
nine...

01:10:22.412 --> 01:10:24.415
Fuck me now, Reggie!

01:10:25.167 --> 01:10:26.210
Ten!

01:10:46.521 --> 01:10:49.441
Why in the hell d'you want
to come to Big Tuna, Sail'?

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.819
I know
it's not exactly Emerald City...

01:10:53.905 --> 01:10:55.530
Not as bad as the weather...

01:10:56.697 --> 01:10:59.952
'though it's a long way
off that road to California.

01:11:01.537 --> 01:11:04.665
Why in the hell d'you want
to come here, baby?

01:11:35.946 --> 01:11:37.614
Oh, look at this!

01:11:38.532 --> 01:11:42.662
What do you want, Mr. Snakeskin?

01:11:43.162 --> 01:11:45.790
I was hoping you could tell me
if there's a contract out on me.

01:11:46.291 --> 01:11:48.751
I really need to know.
- By who?

01:11:49.167 --> 01:11:51.797
Santos. Or Marietta Fortune.

01:11:53.131 --> 01:11:55.549
I heard you were going
with that bitch's daughter.

01:11:55.966 --> 01:12:01.097
You heard right.
- You are one big, stupid asshole.

01:12:03.433 --> 01:12:06.852
Don't you know that her mami and
Santos killed her daddy?

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:13.026
So maybe one night
you got too close to a fire...

01:12:13.443 --> 01:12:15.485
So maybe you're gonna burn.

01:12:17.238 --> 01:12:20.782
I didn't see nothin'.
- Sure. I did.

01:12:40.845 --> 01:12:42.222
Santos!

01:12:52.023 --> 01:12:53.651
Is there a contract?

01:12:54.068 --> 01:12:57.737
We had a deal once:
We'd tip each other off if we heard.

01:12:59.072 --> 01:13:02.910
I know. I remember.

01:13:03.493 --> 01:13:04.619
Well?

01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:10.584
I heard of nothing.

01:13:14.922 --> 01:13:16.340
Thanks.

01:13:56.088 --> 01:13:58.507
Sail', honey, is that you?

01:13:58.924 --> 01:14:00.467
The one and only!

01:14:01.802 --> 01:14:05.347
D'you get that oil, baby?
- Yes siree!

01:14:05.765 --> 01:14:07.893
I met a guy called Red.
He owns a garage.

01:14:14.649 --> 01:14:16.317
What's that smell?

01:14:17.693 --> 01:14:19.236
I barfed.

01:14:20.321 --> 01:14:25.284
I tried to make it to the bathroom,
but it was the wrong door.

01:14:26.327 --> 01:14:30.666
I think all this driving
is upsetting me, baby.

01:14:31.374 --> 01:14:33.668
D'you think we could stay here
and rest a couple of days?

01:14:34.085 --> 01:14:36.046
Are you
carsick, sweetheart?

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:40.049
A little, I guess.

01:14:54.856 --> 01:14:56.566
Oh Sailor, honey:

01:14:58.527 --> 01:15:03.822
I hope seeing that girl die
didn't jinx us.

01:15:15.878 --> 01:15:17.796
I got this for you.

01:15:20.131 --> 01:15:22.301
It has 40 different flavors.

01:15:22.968 --> 01:15:25.638
One for about every reason
I love you.

01:15:27.848 --> 01:15:30.141
Sail', I'm gonna save this.

01:15:32.436 --> 01:15:34.565
But if I ever eat it,

01:15:34.981 --> 01:15:37.440
I'll be thinking of you.

01:15:56.419 --> 01:15:59.964
"Robert Brenton
and two passengers, William Reese

01:16:00.464 --> 01:16:06.430
and Julie Day, were killed
when his car crashed on Highway 118."

01:16:06.846 --> 01:16:09.098
Robert Brenton, that dumb fuck!

01:16:10.309 --> 01:16:13.936
That stupid shit was so dumb,
he deserved to die!

01:16:14.354 --> 01:16:16.064
That asshole!

01:16:19.275 --> 01:16:23.070
Timmy, what's going on in No. 4,
where them lights are always on?

01:16:27.533 --> 01:16:30.828
Them are making
a pornographic movie, Texas style!

01:16:31.454 --> 01:16:33.081
You wanna join in?

01:16:37.292 --> 01:16:42.090
To survive in Big Tuna, you
need an active sense of humor!

01:16:53.727 --> 01:16:58.689
This is Bosis Spool.
We call him "OO Spool".

01:16:59.106 --> 01:17:00.567
The man is a rocket scientist!

01:17:06.155 --> 01:17:10.661
My dog barks some.

01:17:19.336 --> 01:17:23.757
Mentally, you picture my dog,

01:17:25.049 --> 01:17:27.052
but, I have not told you

01:17:27.469 --> 01:17:31.723
the type of dog which I have.

01:17:34.686 --> 01:17:38.313
Perhaps
you might even picture Toto

01:17:38.730 --> 01:17:41.441
from the "Wizard of Oz".

01:17:46.781 --> 01:17:53.121
But I can tell you
my dog is always with me.

01:18:29.450 --> 01:18:31.117
Hey everybody!

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:33.912
Bobby!
Hey, Sailor, Lula,

01:18:34.621 --> 01:18:38.499
This is the man himself!
Bobby, this is Sailor and Lula,

01:18:39.417 --> 01:18:41.127
the 2 most recent strandees,

01:18:41.627 --> 01:18:43.296
of the economic variety.

01:18:44.505 --> 01:18:47.759
Bobby Peru. Like the country.

01:18:48.385 --> 01:18:50.803
Bobby just rolled into town
a few days ago.

01:18:51.221 --> 01:18:53.515
Yeah, Bobby is
the most exciting item

01:18:53.933 --> 01:18:56.310
to hit Big Tuna
since the '86 cyclone

01:18:56.727 --> 01:18:58.811
sheared
the roof off the high school.

01:18:59.229 --> 01:19:03.108
You from Texas, Mr. Peru?

01:19:05.444 --> 01:19:07.488
I'm from all over.

01:19:10.907 --> 01:19:12.576
You were in the Marines.

01:19:17.331 --> 01:19:18.915
Four years.

01:19:19.623 --> 01:19:23.128
Bobby was at Cao Ben.
- What's Cao Ben?

01:19:25.047 --> 01:19:28.508
How old are you?
- Twenty.

01:19:35.933 --> 01:19:40.145
A lot of women and kids
and old people died at Cao Ben.

01:19:44.691 --> 01:19:46.235
You was on a ship, partner.

01:19:47.361 --> 01:19:49.697
Pretty hard to make contact
with the people,

01:19:50.115 --> 01:19:53.409
when you're out
floating in the Golf of Tonkin.

01:19:55.452 --> 01:19:57.747
Come on Bobby,
have another glass of Jack.

01:20:03.002 --> 01:20:05.421
Don't mind
if I fuckin' do.

01:20:15.807 --> 01:20:17.517
Speakin' of Jack...

01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:25.817
One-eyed Jack's yearning to go
peeping in a seafood store...

01:20:32.115 --> 01:20:33.491
Alright.

01:20:36.578 --> 01:20:38.538
Nice meetin' you.

01:20:43.710 --> 01:20:46.086
Adios, boys!
- See ya, Bobby!

01:20:48.047 --> 01:20:49.966
Bobby's got a way...

01:20:50.843 --> 01:20:53.386
Can't shake
that institution out of him.

01:20:56.972 --> 01:21:01.520
Baby, I still ain't feelin' so well.
I'm goin' to bed.

01:21:01.936 --> 01:21:04.856
Will you come with me?
- Yeah, I'll come along.

01:21:07.359 --> 01:21:08.653
Well...

01:21:10.111 --> 01:21:12.614
Good night!
- Good night!

01:21:38.015 --> 01:21:40.392
Lordy, what was that about?

01:21:41.768 --> 01:21:43.437
I don't know...

01:22:00.954 --> 01:22:03.874
Man, that barf smell
don't fade fast.

01:22:05.166 --> 01:22:06.626
Is there anything I can do for you?

01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:10.548
I don't think so, Sail'.

01:22:11.465 --> 01:22:13.801
I just need to lie down.

01:22:47.668 --> 01:22:49.254
You know what?

01:22:50.630 --> 01:22:52.799
I know you ain't
too pleased being here.

01:22:58.429 --> 01:22:59.973
It's not that.

01:23:08.065 --> 01:23:09.775
I'm gonna write it down,

01:23:11.443 --> 01:23:13.737
because I can't say it.

01:23:15.906 --> 01:23:17.658
You can't say it?

01:23:20.493 --> 01:23:23.329
I can't say this, not out loud.

01:23:33.507 --> 01:23:36.052
I'M PREGNANT.

01:23:42.933 --> 01:23:44.475
Oh God!

01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:53.820
It's okay by me, Peanut.

01:23:55.321 --> 01:23:59.116
Well, nothing personal...

01:23:59.534 --> 01:24:01.869
But I ain't so sure
it's okay by me.

01:24:04.622 --> 01:24:08.041
Really, Sail',
it's nothing against you, baby.

01:24:09.084 --> 01:24:10.460
I love you.

01:24:12.672 --> 01:24:14.173
I love you too.

01:24:15.048 --> 01:24:16.509
I know.

01:24:20.514 --> 01:24:24.601
I'm just sort of uncomfortable
about how things are going,

01:24:26.059 --> 01:24:30.648
since we broke down
along that Yellow Brick Road,

01:24:31.065 --> 01:24:34.652
and this doesn't soothe me.

01:24:37.530 --> 01:24:40.701
Honey, I promise I ain't gonna let
things get no worse.

01:24:46.998 --> 01:24:49.042
Not in a million years.

01:25:27.373 --> 01:25:29.249
Hey, pretty woman. Is Sailor here?

01:25:29.666 --> 01:25:33.087
No, he's changing oil out in our car.
- I gotta take a piss, bad,

01:25:33.503 --> 01:25:35.798
can I use your head?

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:38.050
Oh... yeah, I guess.

01:25:38.884 --> 01:25:42.221
I don't mean your head head...
I'm not goin' to piss on your hair,

01:25:42.637 --> 01:25:44.931
just gonna piss in the toilet.

01:25:45.723 --> 01:25:50.980
Ya'll take a listen, you'll hear
a deep sound comin' from Bobby Peru!

01:26:08.747 --> 01:26:12.042
There's a smell in this room of puke.

01:26:13.085 --> 01:26:15.046
Have you been puking?

01:26:18.008 --> 01:26:19.550
Are you sick?

01:26:20.969 --> 01:26:23.804
Pregnant?
- You used the toilet, now go!

01:26:24.221 --> 01:26:26.765
It ain't none of your business
what I do around here!

01:26:27.266 --> 01:26:30.477
I sure do like a woman
with nice tits like yours,

01:26:30.895 --> 01:26:35.066
who talks tough and looks like
she can fuck like a bunny.

01:26:35.483 --> 01:26:36.902
Can you fuck like that?

01:26:38.402 --> 01:26:40.822
You like it like a bunny?

01:26:42.032 --> 01:26:46.160
'Cause if you do, baby,
I'll fuck you good,

01:26:46.577 --> 01:26:50.207
like a big old jack-rabbit,
jump all around that hole!

01:26:51.249 --> 01:26:54.043
Bobby Peru don't come up for air!

01:26:55.629 --> 01:26:57.254
Get out!

01:26:58.214 --> 01:27:00.175
Am I scarin' you?

01:27:02.968 --> 01:27:04.595
Is your pussy wet?

01:27:06.722 --> 01:27:08.350
Is it wet?

01:27:11.186 --> 01:27:13.104
Oh, don't jump back so slow.

01:27:13.522 --> 01:27:17.108
I thought you was a bunny!
Bunnies jump fast.

01:27:17.984 --> 01:27:20.195
You jump back slow.

01:27:21.363 --> 01:27:23.447
Means something, don't it?

01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:27.077
Means something to me.

01:27:28.119 --> 01:27:30.539
Means you want Bobby Peru.

01:27:31.206 --> 01:27:34.126
You want Bobby Peru
to fuck you hard, baby,

01:27:34.544 --> 01:27:36.920
to open you
like a Christmas present!

01:27:38.129 --> 01:27:43.678
You want me to do it?
Just a simple "yes" or "no".

01:27:44.094 --> 01:27:46.555
Just feel me breathin' on ya.

01:27:47.597 --> 01:27:52.353
And you know I mean business
when it comes to fuckin'! - Out!

01:27:53.770 --> 01:27:56.690
Bobby Peru will grab ya...

01:27:57.732 --> 01:27:59.610
hold ya tight...

01:28:00.026 --> 01:28:01.946
feel everythin' in ya.

01:28:02.406 --> 01:28:04.030
Be quiet!

01:28:04.865 --> 01:28:06.324
Say "Fuck me".

01:28:07.158 --> 01:28:09.119
Then I'll leave.
- No way. Get out!

01:28:09.871 --> 01:28:13.875
Say it! I'll tear your
fuckin' heart out, girl!

01:28:14.917 --> 01:28:16.168
Say "Fuck me".

01:28:16.585 --> 01:28:18.255
Say "Fuck me"!

01:28:18.671 --> 01:28:21.632
Then I'll go. Say "Fuck me"!

01:28:22.049 --> 01:28:24.134
Whisper it. Say it!

01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:27.263
Say it. Say it!

01:28:28.723 --> 01:28:30.391
Say "Fuck me".

01:28:31.142 --> 01:28:33.227
Whisper it. "Fuck me".

01:28:34.437 --> 01:28:37.941
"Fuck me". Say "Fuck me".

01:29:16.646 --> 01:29:19.482
Some day honey, I will!
But I gotta get goin'!

01:29:23.986 --> 01:29:26.614
Sing! Don't cry...

01:30:05.696 --> 01:30:07.197
Hi Bobby!

01:30:24.882 --> 01:30:27.968
You need a hand?
- Thanks, but I'm about done.

01:30:29.803 --> 01:30:31.222
How about a beer?

01:30:32.765 --> 01:30:34.392
A beer...

01:30:35.809 --> 01:30:37.102
Well...

01:30:38.896 --> 01:30:40.566
Yeah, Bobby, that'd be fine.

01:30:43.984 --> 01:30:46.153
Where is your
pretty little lady today?

01:30:49.282 --> 01:30:53.453
She's up in our room, restin'.
Hasn't been feelin' well lately.

01:30:54.454 --> 01:30:56.497
Sorry to hear it.

01:31:40.459 --> 01:31:44.296
I've been studying
a situation over in Lobo.

01:31:44.712 --> 01:31:47.006
Take two men to handle it.

01:31:51.469 --> 01:31:53.347
What's that?

01:31:53.764 --> 01:31:57.268
A feed store,
keeps up to 5 K in their safe.

01:31:57.684 --> 01:32:00.896
Need me a good boy
for backup. Even split.

01:32:01.939 --> 01:32:03.691
Interested?

01:32:04.941 --> 01:32:06.693
No, man.

01:32:09.947 --> 01:32:11.574
I don't think so.

01:32:13.242 --> 01:32:15.244
It'll be easy, Sailor.

01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:21.917
Two employees. I take 'em in back
to open the safe. You cover the door.

01:32:29.008 --> 01:32:30.843
You ain't plannin' on raisin'

01:32:31.844 --> 01:32:34.681
a family in the Big Tuna, are you?

01:32:36.557 --> 01:32:39.019
Wait a minute...

01:32:40.061 --> 01:32:42.022
Whad'ya mean by family?

01:32:43.065 --> 01:32:44.524
Well, I mean...

01:32:45.149 --> 01:32:47.234
with Lula...

01:32:49.904 --> 01:32:52.449
being in a family way and all.

01:32:55.035 --> 01:32:57.662
Did Lula tell you
she was pregnant?

01:32:58.370 --> 01:33:01.333
Couple of grand or two
sure would help you two out.

01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:07.254
Get you out West, to Mexico, or
anywhere with a few dollars to spare.

01:33:07.671 --> 01:33:09.966
I've got it figured out good.

01:33:11.133 --> 01:33:14.345
When did you talk to Lula?

01:33:16.972 --> 01:33:19.559
I talked to her
this afternoon,

01:33:23.021 --> 01:33:24.773
when you was out.

01:33:31.238 --> 01:33:35.157
Did she really say
she was pregnant?

01:33:37.745 --> 01:33:40.539
I just took a guess, that's all.

01:33:41.998 --> 01:33:44.167
You in or out on this deal?

01:33:48.046 --> 01:33:50.465
I ain't fucking sure, Bobby.

01:33:53.008 --> 01:33:55.346
Don't take too long to think about it.

01:34:07.690 --> 01:34:09.109
Had enough?

01:34:11.070 --> 01:34:12.654
Have now!

01:34:15.616 --> 01:34:18.285
Let's go outside.
I have something to show you.

01:34:21.622 --> 01:34:24.458
Right here
is a double-barreled, sawed-off

01:34:24.876 --> 01:34:26.501
Ithica shotgun.

01:34:27.961 --> 01:34:29.213
Next to it:

01:34:29.629 --> 01:34:35.469
A Smith & Wesson.38 handgun
with a 4-inch barrel.

01:34:45.771 --> 01:34:47.480
Those'll do her,

01:34:47.899 --> 01:34:50.276
really loosen up that 5 grand.

01:34:50.985 --> 01:34:53.737
Two and a half
for you and the little lady.

01:34:55.448 --> 01:34:57.992
How much money you got left?

01:34:59.911 --> 01:35:01.746
Forty bucks...

01:35:02.289 --> 01:35:04.458
This is easy money, partner.

01:35:04.875 --> 01:35:07.335
Ain't nobody gonna get hurt.

01:35:08.376 --> 01:35:11.088
And I don't think
you can afford to pass it up...

01:35:13.758 --> 01:35:17.929
I'll bring the Eldorado to
the back of the motel at 10 AM.

01:35:19.889 --> 01:35:23.185
Really could
set you and that little lady up good.

01:35:26.979 --> 01:35:28.648
Yeah, I guess so.

01:35:29.649 --> 01:35:31.359
That kinda money

01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:36.907
will get us a long way down
that Yellow Brick Road.

01:35:38.866 --> 01:35:42.663
But damn it, this better go real smooth,
you understand me?

01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:46.374
Like taking candy from a baby.

01:35:58.136 --> 01:35:59.721
Here comes Sailor.

01:36:33.297 --> 01:36:35.340
You've been drinkin', huh?

01:36:36.383 --> 01:36:38.135
A few beers is all.

01:36:40.554 --> 01:36:42.140
Feelin' any better?

01:36:42.807 --> 01:36:44.767
Can't tell yet.

01:36:51.524 --> 01:36:53.735
That smell's still filling this room
good.

01:36:59.742 --> 01:37:01.784
So where d'you say you was?

01:37:06.289 --> 01:37:08.541
I went with Bobby.

01:37:15.255 --> 01:37:16.550
Sail'?

01:37:19.761 --> 01:37:21.137
Let's leave here.

01:37:21.804 --> 01:37:22.889
We are, Peanut.

01:37:27.310 --> 01:37:28.561
Real soon.

01:37:42.701 --> 01:37:45.871
You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru?

01:37:47.704 --> 01:37:49.790
What could I be up to?

01:38:02.096 --> 01:38:05.683
That Bobby Peru
is a black angel, Sail'.

01:38:07.599 --> 01:38:10.478
You hook up
with him and you'll regret it...

01:38:11.272 --> 01:38:13.190
If you live to.

01:38:13.983 --> 01:38:15.733
Thanks, darling.

01:38:17.319 --> 01:38:20.282
I know
you got my interests in mind,

01:38:20.698 --> 01:38:23.033
and I appreciate it sincerely.

01:38:24.076 --> 01:38:26.705
I love you, but
I got to get some sleep now.

01:38:28.747 --> 01:38:34.003
This whole world is wild at heart...
and weird on top.

01:38:43.429 --> 01:38:46.141
I wish you'd sing me
"Love me tender".

01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:51.603
Oh, I wish
I was somewhere over that rainbow.

01:38:53.314 --> 01:38:54.816
It's just shit!

01:38:56.233 --> 01:38:58.402
Shit, shit, shit!

01:39:42.447 --> 01:39:44.449
The whole gang, huh?

01:39:44.866 --> 01:39:45.909
Yes.

01:39:50.079 --> 01:39:53.542
You know, you look
a whole lot better in the flesh.

01:39:57.295 --> 01:39:59.757
The cobra
is waitin' to strike, Chica.

01:40:00.715 --> 01:40:02.592
You know that guy, Sailor?

01:40:03.009 --> 01:40:05.179
He came by the other afternoon.

01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:09.098
He wanted to know if there was
a contract on him. - No shit?

01:40:10.392 --> 01:40:12.811
You know him?
- I used to.

01:40:13.228 --> 01:40:16.022
What did you say?
- "No", of course.

01:40:16.607 --> 01:40:18.316
That's right.

01:40:20.026 --> 01:40:23.197
He could have
a bad accident, though.

01:40:27.618 --> 01:40:28.993
Before,

01:40:29.411 --> 01:40:31.539
during or after a hold-up.

01:40:43.134 --> 01:40:45.011
What am I doing here?

01:40:51.933 --> 01:40:54.395
Sailor, what are you doing here?

01:40:58.566 --> 01:41:00.109
I can't do this.

01:41:12.121 --> 01:41:13.372
Climb in back!

01:41:15.209 --> 01:41:16.834
What the hell's she doin' here?

01:41:17.252 --> 01:41:21.214
She's my girl.
She's drivin'. That bother you?

01:41:21.631 --> 01:41:22.799
Jump in!

01:41:23.217 --> 01:41:24.551
You owe me one.

01:41:24.968 --> 01:41:27.221
Come on, Mr. Big Round Balls,

01:41:28.596 --> 01:41:31.015
let's go
and make us some easy money.

01:41:37.271 --> 01:41:39.857
They say the eagle flies on Friday.

01:43:38.478 --> 01:43:40.480
Get that mask on!

01:43:41.397 --> 01:43:44.318
Keep it revvin', Chiquita.
We'll be right back!

01:43:44.817 --> 01:43:46.903
Nobody's gonna get hurt.
Remember that!

01:43:47.987 --> 01:43:49.572
Right, partner!

01:44:01.877 --> 01:44:03.503
Okay, boys!

01:44:03.921 --> 01:44:06.882
Get in the back!
Get into the back! Now! Both of you!

01:44:09.717 --> 01:44:12.637
If anyone comes in,
herd 'em back here quick.

01:44:13.054 --> 01:44:15.807
Alright,
let's make this nice and easy!

01:44:41.041 --> 01:44:43.085
You waitin' for somebody?

01:44:43.501 --> 01:44:45.045
My husband.

01:44:47.631 --> 01:44:50.426
He's in the feed store.

01:44:54.555 --> 01:44:58.684
Well, watch that cigarette, ma'am.
It's about to burn down to your fingers.

01:44:59.101 --> 01:45:01.520
Thank you, officer.

01:45:02.730 --> 01:45:05.775
I haven't seen you before.
Are you from Lobo?

01:45:06.818 --> 01:45:07.861
No.

01:45:08.652 --> 01:45:10.237
Over here!

01:45:11.864 --> 01:45:13.449
Big Tuna, huh?

01:45:13.866 --> 01:45:16.493
That's quite a drive, isn't it?
- Yes.

01:45:16.952 --> 01:45:18.204
Let's go!

01:45:18.996 --> 01:45:20.079
Say "Cheese".

01:45:23.001 --> 01:45:24.293
Stay put!

01:45:29.717 --> 01:45:31.258
Cool it, man!

01:45:33.803 --> 01:45:35.346
You're next, fucker!

01:45:47.443 --> 01:45:50.987
Those are dummies, dummy!

01:45:56.785 --> 01:45:59.246
Step up here, hotshot!

01:45:59.663 --> 01:46:02.123
I'll slap
that smile right off your face!

01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:24.230
Stop, you sons of bitches!

01:46:25.690 --> 01:46:27.774
This is the police!
Hold it or I'll shoot!

01:46:41.788 --> 01:46:43.082
Oh, for Christ's sakes!

01:46:46.042 --> 01:46:47.878
That poor bastard.

01:46:49.755 --> 01:46:51.466
Hands behind your head, cowboy!

01:46:54.468 --> 01:46:58.597
Lula, I really let you
down this time.

01:47:00.474 --> 01:47:01.851
Peanut!

01:47:02.518 --> 01:47:04.312
Look for the damned thing!

01:47:04.728 --> 01:47:09.692
We'll find it,
they sew them things back on.

01:47:10.109 --> 01:47:11.652
Works good as new.

01:47:12.068 --> 01:47:14.154
I can't find it.
Where is the damned thing?

01:47:14.571 --> 01:47:16.282
It's gotta be here somewhere.

01:47:44.061 --> 01:47:47.647
Pardon me. I'm lookin' for 770378.

01:48:01.327 --> 01:48:02.996
Sailor, baby!

01:48:33.026 --> 01:48:38.740
Oh my God! Oh my God!

01:48:39.156 --> 01:48:43.538
My baby, sweetest one. Oh, sweetheart.

01:48:43.955 --> 01:48:46.415
Mama's gonna take you home.
We're gonna go home.

01:48:46.833 --> 01:48:48.877
Santos is gonna help us.

01:48:49.293 --> 01:48:54.883
He's gonna take us
to the airport in San Antonio.

01:48:55.340 --> 01:48:58.135
It's OK, baby.
- No... - Yes.

01:48:59.678 --> 01:49:01.472
Come!
We're gonna go.

01:49:01.889 --> 01:49:03.433
It's OK.
- Mama! - Yes?

01:49:03.850 --> 01:49:07.227
Sailor's in deep trouble here.
I can't just leave him.

01:49:07.645 --> 01:49:10.940
Oh yes, you can!

01:49:11.357 --> 01:49:14.109
Yes, you can!

01:49:19.032 --> 01:49:21.743
Your mama was
real worried about you, honey.

01:49:22.784 --> 01:49:24.412
Me too.

01:49:26.914 --> 01:49:29.460
Can you
give your old friend Santos a hug?

01:49:40.386 --> 01:49:42.222
Dearest Sailor,

01:49:42.888 --> 01:49:46.518
First thing you'll want to know is:
I'm keeping the baby.

01:49:46.935 --> 01:49:50.647
Mama wasn't for it at first,
but I think now she is.

01:49:51.064 --> 01:49:56.110
I'm gonna name it Pace,
no matter if it's a boy or a girl.

01:49:56.528 --> 01:50:01.782
It's kinda hard to believe that
Pace will be six when you get out.

01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:04.744
Our child!

01:50:05.162 --> 01:50:07.539
I love you, Sailor.

01:50:07.956 --> 01:50:10.501
I miss dancing
and talking,

01:50:10.917 --> 01:50:13.170
and especially the other!

01:50:18.216 --> 01:50:21.594
5 YEARS, 10 MONTHS, 21 DAYS LATER

01:50:22.595 --> 01:50:27.684
When... does... Sailor's train get in?

01:50:28.977 --> 01:50:30.397
Six.

01:50:35.900 --> 01:50:38.821
If I asked you
not to go...

01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:41.447
It wouldn't make any difference.

01:50:42.699 --> 01:50:46.245
Girl, what if I told you
not to go?

01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:50.374
Mama, if you get in the way
of our happiness,

01:50:50.791 --> 01:50:53.127
I'll fucking pull your
arms out by the roots!

01:51:13.063 --> 01:51:15.024
No!

01:51:22.323 --> 01:51:25.035
Mama,
you almost crashed us!

01:51:27.078 --> 01:51:29.039
Oh, an accident, baby!

01:51:37.046 --> 01:51:39.088
Oh no, oh man!

01:51:41.718 --> 01:51:44.345
Same fuckin' thing
happened to me last year!

01:52:43.197 --> 01:52:44.948
You must be my son.

01:52:49.703 --> 01:52:51.998
Shake hands with your daddy, Pace.

01:52:56.918 --> 01:53:01.215
It's a pleasure to meet you, Pace.
I read a lot about you.

01:53:26.741 --> 01:53:28.576
Are you hungry?

01:53:30.828 --> 01:53:32.705
Lead the way.

01:53:33.748 --> 01:53:35.208
No!

01:53:36.583 --> 01:53:37.877
No!

01:54:00.816 --> 01:54:02.778
What's wrong, Mama?

01:54:03.195 --> 01:54:05.613
Don't worry, son. Just stay here.

01:54:18.961 --> 01:54:21.420
I'm sorry, Sailor,
I just can't help it.

01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:25.591
Just give me one little minute,
then I'll quit.

01:54:26.009 --> 01:54:29.471
The boy's frightened,
Lula. This ain't no good.

01:54:32.099 --> 01:54:34.434
Really, Sailor, I'll be okay.

01:54:41.357 --> 01:54:43.359
It's a mistake, honey.

01:54:43.777 --> 01:54:47.197
You two go on.
I'll walk back to the depot.

01:54:48.532 --> 01:54:52.953
What are you talking about?
That's your son in there!

01:54:53.370 --> 01:54:55.290
He never knew me, Lula.

01:54:55.706 --> 01:54:57.583
So there's not
much for him to forget.

01:54:57.999 --> 01:55:02.336
And 6 years apart
makes it almost simple for us too.

01:55:04.131 --> 01:55:06.300
How can you say that, Sailor?

01:55:08.218 --> 01:55:10.178
It's what makes sense.

01:55:13.725 --> 01:55:15.767
Please don't do this, Sailor!

01:55:18.312 --> 01:55:19.979
If ever something
doesn't feel right to you,

01:55:20.398 --> 01:55:22.567
remember
what Pancho said to the Cisco Kid:

01:55:23.610 --> 01:55:29.199
"Let's win, before we're dancing
at the end of a rope, without music."

01:55:43.128 --> 01:55:45.715
You've been fine without me.

01:55:46.131 --> 01:55:50.094
No need to make life
tougher than it has to be.

01:56:12.158 --> 01:56:14.370
Sailor, come back!

01:57:22.687 --> 01:57:24.231
What do you faggots want?

01:58:05.981 --> 01:58:07.274
The Good Witch...

01:58:10.153 --> 01:58:11.738
Lula loves you.

01:58:12.531 --> 01:58:16.284
But I'm a robber
and a manslaughterer.

01:58:16.702 --> 01:58:19.119
And I haven't had
any parental guidance.

01:58:19.538 --> 01:58:22.582
She's forgiven you all that.

01:58:23.792 --> 01:58:27.295
You love her.

01:58:27.712 --> 01:58:29.840
Don't be afraid, Sailor.

01:58:30.966 --> 01:58:34.094
But I'm wild at heart.

01:58:34.554 --> 01:58:37.265
If you are truly wild at heart,

01:58:38.306 --> 01:58:40.725
you'll fight for your dreams.

01:58:44.896 --> 01:58:47.774
Don't turn away from love, Sailor.

01:58:49.651 --> 01:58:52.113
Don't turn away from love.

01:59:19.890 --> 01:59:21.309
Had enough, asshole?

01:59:24.102 --> 01:59:25.854
Yes I have.

01:59:26.439 --> 01:59:28.649
And I want to
apologize to you gentlemen

01:59:29.066 --> 01:59:31.402
for referring to you as homosexuals.

01:59:31.819 --> 01:59:34.405
I also want to thank you fellows.

01:59:34.822 --> 01:59:38.034
You've taught me
a valuable lesson in life.

02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:10.794
I just met
the Good Witch.
