00:28.561 --> 00:29.858
Ouch.

00:29.929 --> 00:31.191
Wake up.

00:31.264 --> 00:32.856
Who's there?

00:32.932 --> 00:34.524
Naomi.

00:34.634 --> 00:36.864
Come back later.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.369
You know what l think?

00:38.438 --> 00:40.906
l think you're scared
of the tree monster.

00:51.317 --> 00:55.913
l'm not scared of any tree
monster, Miss Wildman,

00:55.989 --> 00:59.982
but, as you know,
l need my beauty sleep.

01:00.093 --> 01:02.721
l'm sorry l woke you,
but we have a mission.

01:02.762 --> 01:04.626
You and your missions.

01:04.697 --> 01:07.495
Lucky for you,
your old pal Flotter

01:07.567 --> 01:09.125
has everything ready.

01:09.235 --> 01:10.327
Follow me.

01:12.705 --> 01:14.502
l've laid a trap.

01:14.574 --> 01:17.168
When he climbs this tree,
he'll trip the alarm.

01:18.678 --> 01:21.772
Tree monsters are terrified
of high-pitched noises.

01:21.848 --> 01:23.008
l never heard that.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.675
Ah! lt's a well-known fact.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.686
The bell will scare him
high into those branches

01:27.754 --> 01:30.279
where counterweights
will bend the treetop

01:30.356 --> 01:33.189
till it springs back,
catapulting him pondward

01:33.259 --> 01:34.521
and splash.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.858
He'll sink like a log.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.864
But, Flotter... logs float.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.958
Details, details.

01:42.068 --> 01:43.592
That is a terrible plan.

01:43.703 --> 01:45.728
lt's him!

01:45.839 --> 01:48.364
The name's Trevis,
and you are...?

01:48.475 --> 01:51.672
Flotter. Flotter T. Water lll.

01:51.744 --> 01:54.235
Well, of course you are, drippy.

01:54.314 --> 01:55.440
You.

01:55.515 --> 01:58.916
Naomi Wildman,
but my friends call me Naomi.

01:59.018 --> 02:01.452
l don't recognize your element.

02:01.521 --> 02:04.786
You're not earth or water
or plasma.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.018
l'm human.

02:06.092 --> 02:07.252
Where do you live?

02:07.327 --> 02:09.056
ln space.

02:09.128 --> 02:10.756
Nobody lives in space.

02:10.830 --> 02:11.797
She does...

02:11.865 --> 02:14.163
on a starship called Voyager.

02:14.267 --> 02:15.564
l'm an explorer.

02:15.668 --> 02:16.794
Really?

02:16.903 --> 02:19.599
An explorer.

02:19.706 --> 02:20.798
Timber.

02:20.907 --> 02:22.169
What's that like?

02:22.242 --> 02:25.177
Well, you know--
space battles with aliens,

02:25.245 --> 02:26.507
strange anomalies.

02:26.579 --> 02:29.844
May l visit your starship?

02:29.916 --> 02:33.147
Well, l'll have to ask my mom.

02:33.219 --> 02:35.187
You know, for a monster,
you're very polite.

02:37.924 --> 02:41.189
That's because
l'm not a monster.

02:42.595 --> 02:43.857
You see that?

02:43.930 --> 02:45.522
l'm not scared one bit.

02:45.598 --> 02:48.863
My bark is worse than my bite.

02:48.968 --> 02:51.835
Maybe we jumped to conclusions
about him.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.873
Well, he may not be a monster,

02:54.040 --> 02:56.235
but he is stealing
my water with his roots.

02:56.309 --> 02:57.469
Stealing!

02:57.544 --> 03:02.106
Absurd!
Why, l ought to dry you out.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.150
And l ought to chop you down.

03:04.217 --> 03:05.912
You want a piece of me?

03:05.985 --> 03:08.783
Excuse me. lt sounds like
you two need each other.

03:08.888 --> 03:11.254
l mean, think about it.

03:11.324 --> 03:12.916
Flotter, your water
helps his trees grow,

03:12.992 --> 03:16.120
and, Trevis, your branches
shade his pond from the sun.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.187
lt's a well-known fact
that the sun

03:18.264 --> 03:19.526
makes water evaporate.

03:19.599 --> 03:20.623
She's got a point.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.600
The girl's a thinker.

03:22.702 --> 03:25.762
Now, shake hands and make up.

03:31.244 --> 03:33.178
Ugh... moist palms.

03:33.246 --> 03:35.510
Sappy fingers.

03:35.582 --> 03:37.174
Neelix to Holodeck 2.

03:37.250 --> 03:38.376
Naomi here.

03:38.451 --> 03:39.577
lt's bedtime.

03:39.652 --> 03:41.415
Can't l stay a little longer?

03:41.487 --> 03:42.749
You know the rules.

03:42.822 --> 03:45.382
Besides, someone special
wants to say good night.

03:45.458 --> 03:46.857
Mom!

03:46.926 --> 03:49.053
Computer, end program.

03:49.128 --> 03:50.493
And how's Flotter?

03:50.563 --> 03:53.794
Grouchy as ever, but we made
a new friend today named Trevis.

03:53.866 --> 03:55.629
l'll introduce him
to you tomorrow

03:55.735 --> 03:56.997
as soon as you get home.

03:59.305 --> 04:00.567
l'm afraid the away mission

04:00.640 --> 04:02.471
may take a few more days,
sweetheart.

04:02.542 --> 04:03.600
Days?

04:03.710 --> 04:05.177
Yes...

04:05.245 --> 04:08.271
but l'm bringing you back some
beautiful sillinite crystals

04:08.348 --> 04:10.646
and lots of holopictures
for your data album.

04:10.717 --> 04:12.742
Now be a good girl
and get ready for bed

04:12.819 --> 04:14.446
while l talk to Neelix.

04:14.520 --> 04:15.782
All right.

04:15.855 --> 04:17.152
Sweet dreams.

04:23.196 --> 04:24.288
Samantha?

04:24.364 --> 04:26.389
We ran into an ion storm.

04:26.466 --> 04:28.093
How bad is it?

04:28.201 --> 04:29.498
We took a real beating.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.229
We're trying to make repairs,

04:31.337 --> 04:32.964
but there's
another storm on the way.

04:34.073 --> 04:35.005
Better go.

04:35.074 --> 04:36.769
Say good night for me?

04:38.878 --> 04:40.470
l've lost the com signal.

04:40.546 --> 04:43.481
A level-7 ionic front is
closing aft at 33,000 kph.

04:43.549 --> 04:45.517
l need more power
to the thrusters

04:45.585 --> 04:46.847
if l'm going to outrun it.

04:46.986 --> 04:48.419
l'll see what l can do.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.479
The leading edge is approaching.

04:50.556 --> 04:52.319
l've given all the power
l can spare, Tom.

04:52.392 --> 04:53.518
lt's not enough.

04:53.593 --> 04:55.458
l can't keep ahead
of this thing.

04:55.528 --> 04:57.223
Brace for impact!

06:55.181 --> 06:56.978
Mayday, mayday.

06:57.049 --> 06:58.311
Delta Flyer to Voyager.

06:58.384 --> 07:00.409
We need assistance.

07:00.486 --> 07:03.717
Warp drive is...
lmpulse power is down.

07:03.790 --> 07:06.623
..thrusters only.

07:06.692 --> 07:09.957
...ion storms damaged
our primary systems.

07:10.029 --> 07:12.497
Life support is failing.

07:12.565 --> 07:15.466
We're searching
for an emergency landing site.

07:15.568 --> 07:17.365
We require immediate....

07:20.907 --> 07:22.772
That was
their last transmission.

07:22.909 --> 07:24.672
We haven't been able
to raise them since.

07:24.744 --> 07:26.405
lf they're looking
for a place to land,

07:26.479 --> 07:27.912
they must be
in pretty bad shape.

07:27.980 --> 07:29.311
Anything on long-range sensors?

07:29.382 --> 07:32.078
We lost their signature
when the second ion storm hit,

07:32.151 --> 07:34.119
but we've triangulated
the coordinates

07:34.187 --> 07:35.313
of the distress call.

07:35.388 --> 07:36.787
They've entered
a planetary system

07:36.889 --> 07:38.254
about .6 light-years from here.

07:38.324 --> 07:40.053
Problem is, there's
another ion storm--

07:40.126 --> 07:41.593
a level-5--
blocking our path.

07:41.661 --> 07:43.561
Level-5?

07:43.629 --> 07:45.290
We've been through worse.

07:45.364 --> 07:46.797
Let's just batten
down the hatches

07:46.899 --> 07:48.059
and reinforce the shields.

07:48.167 --> 07:49.156
We're not going to let

07:49.268 --> 07:51.099
a little bad weather
stand in our way.

07:51.204 --> 07:52.136
What about Naomi?

07:52.205 --> 07:54.105
l guess somebody's going to have

07:54.173 --> 07:56.403
to explain
why her mother's not back.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.842
Maybe we shouldn't
tell her anything.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.172
Why not?

08:00.246 --> 08:03.181
She's a very sensitive girl.

08:03.249 --> 08:05.342
l-l don't want to alarm
her unnecessarily.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.113
With any luck,
we'll have her mother back

08:07.186 --> 08:08.517
before she starts to worry.

08:08.588 --> 08:10.556
Well, you're closer to her
than anyone.

08:10.623 --> 08:12.716
l'm inclined to let you
take the lead on this.

08:12.859 --> 08:14.053
Thanks, Captain.

08:14.126 --> 08:16.594
All right.
Consider it your mission

08:16.662 --> 08:17.924
to keep her occupied.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.055
Aye, Captain.

08:19.131 --> 08:20.155
Dismissed.

08:25.271 --> 08:26.465
l was thinking...

08:26.572 --> 08:27.664
Oh?

08:27.773 --> 08:30.173
lt's time l carried
my weight around here.

08:30.243 --> 08:34.179
Ah. They could use a hand
in the airponics bay.

08:34.246 --> 08:37.511
l was thinking
more of the Bridge.

08:37.582 --> 08:39.049
Captain's Assistant.

08:39.118 --> 08:40.642
Would l get to fly the ship?

08:40.720 --> 08:43.712
Well, we'd have to take
it up with the Captain.

08:46.425 --> 08:48.086
We need to check
the internal sensors.

08:48.160 --> 08:51.027
Neelix, don't move.

08:51.097 --> 08:52.655
What's wrong?

08:52.732 --> 08:54.495
The Borg lady.

08:56.302 --> 08:58.099
She has a name, you know.

08:58.204 --> 09:02.800
Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct
of Unimatrix Zero One.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.706
Don't look.

09:04.810 --> 09:06.141
She'll assimilate you.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.237
Naomi, Seven is a nice person

09:08.314 --> 09:11.181
and she's a valuable member
of this crew.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.150
l don't want to be
in her collective.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.414
l don't think
there's much danger of that.

09:15.488 --> 09:16.386
Hey, Neelix.

09:16.455 --> 09:17.444
Hey, Naomi.

09:17.523 --> 09:19.115
Neelix, can l talk with you?

09:19.191 --> 09:20.715
Yeah. l'll be right back.

09:22.161 --> 09:24.425
Sick Bay's running short
on emergency medkits.

09:24.497 --> 09:25.623
We're going to need a few more

09:25.698 --> 09:27.529
if we send another away team
after the shuttle.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.433
l've got half a dozen
stockpiled in Cargo Bay 2.

09:30.536 --> 09:32.731
How is she?

09:32.838 --> 09:36.501
On the Naomi anxiety
scale of one to ten--

09:36.576 --> 09:39.943
where one is a touch of insomnia
and ten is a panic attack--

09:40.012 --> 09:41.206
about five.

09:42.315 --> 09:44.715
ls this chair occupied?

09:44.784 --> 09:48.083
Yes or no would suffice.

09:48.154 --> 09:49.519
No.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.147
l mean, yes.

09:51.223 --> 09:52.485
Explain.

09:52.558 --> 09:53.786
You can't sit here.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.087
Somebody else is sitting here.

09:56.162 --> 09:57.652
Very well.

10:01.167 --> 10:04.068
So... l thought we'd pay
another visit to Sick Bay.

10:04.136 --> 10:06.604
The Doctor says he has time
to give you a...

10:06.672 --> 10:08.105
botany lesson.

10:08.174 --> 10:09.471
What's wrong?

10:11.644 --> 10:13.839
l am Borg.

10:13.913 --> 10:15.505
No, you're not.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.579
Could we go
to the holodeck first?

10:18.651 --> 10:20.812
l want to play
another Flotter story.

10:20.886 --> 10:23.047
Well, the Doctor's
expecting you.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.056
l don't like Sick Bay.

10:25.124 --> 10:25.988
Why not?

10:26.058 --> 10:28.356
lt's full of creepy things--

10:28.427 --> 10:30.725
alien organs and hyposprays.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.229
Well, that's not true.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.357
The Doctor talks too much.

10:34.433 --> 10:36.731
Well, that's his way.

10:36.836 --> 10:39.236
Can't you reprogram him
or something?

10:39.305 --> 10:42.206
Oh, l-l don't think
he'd like that very much.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.435
Come on.

10:49.515 --> 10:52.313
Rumor has it
there's a planetoid around here.

10:52.385 --> 10:53.579
Sorry, Tom.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.814
The storm
is throwing off my readings.

10:55.888 --> 10:57.913
There's definitely
a big rock nearby.

10:58.057 --> 10:59.285
l just can't find it.

10:59.358 --> 11:00.848
The wave front
is accelerating.

11:00.926 --> 11:02.188
How long till it hits us?

11:02.261 --> 11:03.558
Less than two minutes.

11:03.629 --> 11:06.154
Great. That gives me 30 seconds
to land this thing.

11:06.232 --> 11:07.995
Samantha,
l don't mean to rush you.

11:08.067 --> 11:09.159
Got it.

11:09.268 --> 11:10.394
Class-M atmosphere,

11:10.503 --> 11:12.698
nickel-iron core,
bemonite mantle.

11:12.805 --> 11:16.741
Bemonite? l want to land
this shuttle, not bury it.

11:16.809 --> 11:19.403
73,000 kilometers,
bearing 0 mark 4.

11:26.652 --> 11:28.916
We've entered
the upper atmosphere.

11:30.156 --> 11:32.556
Nothing but impact craters,
volcanoes...

11:32.625 --> 11:33.990
We can't land here.

11:34.060 --> 11:35.652
The storm is closing.

11:35.728 --> 11:38.060
lncreasing shields to maximum.

11:38.130 --> 11:41.099
Just keep us away from the
volcanoes and we'll be okay.

11:41.200 --> 11:45.637
l've got a big meteor crater,
500 kilometers across, 3.7 deep.

11:45.738 --> 11:46.796
l'll take it.

11:46.906 --> 11:48.464
Starboard thrusters are down.

11:48.574 --> 11:51.805
Tuvok, if you don't have
something positive to say...

11:51.877 --> 11:53.037
We're coming in too fast.

11:53.112 --> 11:54.079
Hang on!

12:04.590 --> 12:07.559
The Flyer has landed.

12:13.599 --> 12:17.057
She needs
immediate medical assistance.

12:28.614 --> 12:30.582
What happened?

12:31.617 --> 12:33.084
We made it.

12:34.453 --> 12:36.580
Delta Flyer's first landing.

12:37.790 --> 12:39.223
Where...

12:39.291 --> 12:42.158
About three kilometers
beneath the surface.

12:42.228 --> 12:45.322
At least our primary
hull's still in one piece.

12:45.397 --> 12:46.830
Wish l felt the same.

12:46.899 --> 12:48.526
You'll be all right.

12:48.634 --> 12:51.535
Minor concussion,
a few fractures--

12:51.604 --> 12:53.538
nothing l can't handle.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.541
You're a great nurse,
but you're a lousy liar.

12:59.111 --> 13:02.740
You've got a punctured kidney
and you're bleeding internally.

13:02.815 --> 13:04.646
You need surgery.

13:04.717 --> 13:06.150
Voyager?.

13:06.218 --> 13:09.312
l've transmitted
another distress call.

13:09.388 --> 13:10.650
No response.

13:10.723 --> 13:12.156
lt's all this rock.

13:12.224 --> 13:14.658
l've got to talk to Naomi;
let her know we're okay.

13:15.895 --> 13:17.522
Conserve your strength, Ensign.

13:17.596 --> 13:20.258
Mr. Paris and l have
the situation under control.

13:20.332 --> 13:21.799
Nice bedside manner, Tuvok.

13:21.934 --> 13:24.494
Sam, l'm going to give
you a mild sedative

13:24.603 --> 13:26.195
and something for the pain.

13:33.612 --> 13:36.547
Any chance we could
abandon the shuttle,

13:36.615 --> 13:38.207
make our way on foot?

13:38.284 --> 13:39.512
Unlikely.

13:39.585 --> 13:42.110
Not only are we buried
under several kilotons of rock,

13:42.188 --> 13:43.780
but the atmosphere
in this cavern

13:43.856 --> 13:45.380
is flooded with fluorine gas.

13:47.126 --> 13:51.586
Nothing to do but sit back
and enjoy the view.

13:54.433 --> 13:56.264
Captain's Log, supplemental.

13:56.368 --> 13:57.596
We've weathered the ion storm

13:57.703 --> 14:00.433
and tracked the Delta Flyer
to an M-class planetoid.

14:01.740 --> 14:03.731
l'm picking up a residual
impulse signature

14:03.876 --> 14:05.138
in the upper atmosphere.

14:05.211 --> 14:07.145
Try to pinpoint their location.

14:07.213 --> 14:08.475
How's our littlest crew member?

14:08.547 --> 14:09.980
She misses her mother,

14:10.049 --> 14:11.949
but l don't think
she suspects anything.

14:12.017 --> 14:14.144
l was just about
to take her to the holodeck

14:14.220 --> 14:15.482
for some more storytelling.

14:15.554 --> 14:16.782
Call me an optimist, Neelix,

14:16.889 --> 14:18.789
but l'm still counting
on a happy ending.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.120
Me, too.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.217
Got it!
The impulse wake leads

14:22.294 --> 14:25.388
to the northern hemisphere:
coordinates 121 mark 16.

14:25.464 --> 14:26.658
Any sign of them?

14:26.732 --> 14:29.895
Plasma fires...
hull fragments...

14:30.002 --> 14:32.095
Either they vaporized on impact

14:32.204 --> 14:33.671
or they're buried
beneath the surface.

14:33.739 --> 14:35.229
Any life signs?

14:35.341 --> 14:38.504
Maybe they beamed out
before the crash.

14:38.577 --> 14:41.512
Harry, anything?

14:41.580 --> 14:43.411
Nothing.

14:43.482 --> 14:47.077
We built the Delta Flyer
to take a lot of punishment.

14:47.152 --> 14:49.177
l'm betting it held together.

14:49.255 --> 14:52.986
Commander, take rescue teams
down to that crater.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.582
lf sensors can't find them,

14:54.660 --> 14:56.252
we'll have to do it
the hard way.

14:56.328 --> 14:57.295
Harry.

15:00.699 --> 15:04.294
Now, see the organelle
just over there?

15:04.403 --> 15:07.600
The one that looks like
a little bitty potato?

15:07.706 --> 15:09.139
The mitochondria?

15:09.208 --> 15:10.266
Yes.

15:10.376 --> 15:12.401
''Mitochondria:
The warp core of the cell.''

15:12.478 --> 15:13.570
Exactly.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.011
Now, what if l told you

15:15.080 --> 15:17.378
that this fellow
was invited to dinner,

15:17.449 --> 15:20.043
but never got around
to leaving?

15:20.119 --> 15:21.484
What do you mean?

15:21.553 --> 15:23.987
Well, turn back the clock
a few billion years

15:24.056 --> 15:26.456
to when cells first evolved.

15:26.525 --> 15:29.153
These early cells
had no mitochondria.

15:29.228 --> 15:31.788
They struggled along
without them, making do

15:31.931 --> 15:34.024
with whatever energy
sources they could find.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.260
Then, one day,

15:36.368 --> 15:38.700
a mitochondrial ancestor
arrived,

15:38.804 --> 15:42.001
broke though the cell wall
and made himself at home.

15:42.074 --> 15:43.735
They became friends?

15:43.809 --> 15:47.677
The correct term is ''symbiosis.''

15:47.746 --> 15:51.273
-Friends.
-Friends.

15:51.350 --> 15:55.116
My mom says cooperation is more
important than competition.

15:55.187 --> 15:57.087
Mm-hmm.

15:57.156 --> 16:00.284
She was supposed
to call me today.

16:00.359 --> 16:04.420
Well, she's probably
just a little busy.

16:04.496 --> 16:06.430
Now, let's have a look
at the cell wall.

16:06.498 --> 16:08.557
lt looks simple enough,
but believe you me,

16:08.667 --> 16:10.430
there's more here
than meets the eye.

16:10.536 --> 16:11.628
Can we try to call her?

16:12.738 --> 16:13.670
Neelix.

16:13.739 --> 16:16.173
What a pleasure to see you.

16:16.241 --> 16:18.209
How was school today?

16:18.310 --> 16:19.777
Good.

16:19.878 --> 16:22.142
There's a time for school
and there's a time for...

16:22.214 --> 16:23.511
Flotter.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.651
Uh... aren't you
forgetting something?

16:26.719 --> 16:27.651
Oh.

16:27.720 --> 16:28.778
Thank you, Doctor.

16:28.854 --> 16:30.845
You're quite welcome,
Miss Wildman.

16:38.197 --> 16:41.428
ln the blink of an eye,
there was Trevis above us.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.762
Then what happened?

16:42.868 --> 16:44.802
He turned out to be very nice.

16:44.870 --> 16:46.997
His bark was worse
than his bite.

16:48.307 --> 16:50.707
Where did you learn
to make such silly puns?

16:50.776 --> 16:52.038
You.

16:52.111 --> 16:53.305
Oh.

16:53.379 --> 16:55.847
Neelix, did you have
a favorite holodeck program

16:55.948 --> 16:57.210
when you were growing up?

16:57.282 --> 16:59.512
Well, we didn't have
any holodecks on Rinax,

16:59.585 --> 17:01.348
but it didn't matter
because we had

17:01.453 --> 17:03.614
a great big forest
right behind my house.

17:03.655 --> 17:04.587
Really?

17:04.656 --> 17:05.917
Uh-huh.

17:05.991 --> 17:09.483
And my sisters and l would
go exploring every day.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.586
We'd make up our own stories.

17:11.663 --> 17:13.392
lmagination.

17:13.464 --> 17:14.590
Exactly.

17:14.665 --> 17:17.362
Deck 6, Section 9.

17:17.469 --> 17:20.597
Where are your sisters now?

17:22.374 --> 17:25.935
Oh... they're
far away from here.

17:26.011 --> 17:28.069
l haven't seen them
in a very long time.

17:28.146 --> 17:30.012
How long?

17:30.082 --> 17:32.414
Many years.

17:32.484 --> 17:35.385
But you haven't been
on Voyager for that long.

17:35.454 --> 17:37.319
True, but before that,

17:37.389 --> 17:41.052
my work as a trader
kept me away from home.

17:41.126 --> 17:43.651
That's too bad.

17:47.299 --> 17:49.028
Do your sisters ever call you

17:49.134 --> 17:52.035
like my mom does when
she's on an away mission?

17:52.104 --> 17:53.036
No.

17:53.105 --> 17:55.437
l bet you miss them.

17:55.507 --> 17:57.407
l do, very much.

17:57.476 --> 17:58.909
Here we are.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.374
Computer, display
chapter headings

18:04.450 --> 18:06.577
The Adventures of Flotter.

18:06.652 --> 18:07.584
Let's see.

18:07.653 --> 18:10.087
''Flotter and the Tree Monster''?

18:10.155 --> 18:12.919
Played that one yesterday.

18:12.991 --> 18:15.391
Okay. ''Trevis and the
Terribly Twisted Trunk.''

18:15.461 --> 18:17.395
l promised l'd save
that one for mom.

18:17.463 --> 18:18.487
lt's her favorite.

18:18.564 --> 18:22.728
''Flotter, Trevis
and the Ogre of Fire.''

18:22.868 --> 18:24.597
Yeah. That one.

18:24.703 --> 18:26.967
Huh. That sounds a little scary.

18:27.039 --> 18:28.006
lt's okay.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.007
l won't be scared
if you're with me.

18:33.212 --> 18:36.340
Once upon a time
in the Forest of Forever,

18:36.415 --> 18:38.610
Flotter and Trevis
encountered a strange element

18:38.684 --> 18:40.379
they'd never seen before.

18:46.058 --> 18:48.288
Trevis, you're on fire.

18:48.360 --> 18:49.884
l told him not to touch it,

18:49.962 --> 18:51.896
but this blockhead
never listens.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.932
Stop complaining and help him.

18:53.999 --> 18:55.227
Me?

18:55.334 --> 18:56.596
Water puts out fire.

19:00.005 --> 19:01.700
Oh, thank you.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.331
Hey, it worked.

19:03.442 --> 19:04.636
Watch this.

19:14.786 --> 19:17.277
Good thinking, Naomi.

19:17.356 --> 19:18.823
Who's the furball?

19:18.891 --> 19:20.654
The name's Neelix.

19:20.726 --> 19:22.819
What caused the fire?

19:22.895 --> 19:24.726
lt came from up there.

19:24.796 --> 19:25.728
ln a flash.

19:25.797 --> 19:27.731
Lightning.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.232
But the sky is clear.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.768
lt doesn't look
like a thunderstorm.

19:31.870 --> 19:33.770
What's your theory, Naomi?

19:33.872 --> 19:36.636
There's only
one other explanation--

19:36.708 --> 19:39.438
the Ogre of Fire.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.411
The Ogre...

19:41.480 --> 19:43.380
...of Fire?

19:43.448 --> 19:45.143
Who's he?

19:45.217 --> 19:47.777
He is me!

19:47.853 --> 19:52.347
And l'm going to burn
this forest to the ground!

19:58.197 --> 20:01.428
Oh! Oh... Oh!

20:02.601 --> 20:04.193
Flotter!

20:14.146 --> 20:17.673
Maybe... we should
play another program.

20:17.749 --> 20:20.013
No, we have to find Flotter.

20:20.085 --> 20:21.848
Hello! ls anyone there?

20:21.987 --> 20:23.386
Over here.

20:24.523 --> 20:26.582
Trevis, are you all right?

20:26.658 --> 20:28.853
Uh-huh. A little hot
under the bark, maybe.

20:28.961 --> 20:30.758
What about Flotter?

20:32.364 --> 20:34.628
ls he dead?

20:36.301 --> 20:37.199
Neelix?

20:37.302 --> 20:38.291
Well, l...

20:38.403 --> 20:39.768
l don't know.

20:39.838 --> 20:41.271
He can't be dead.

20:41.340 --> 20:42.272
Flotter!

20:42.341 --> 20:43.399
l think it's your bedtime.

20:43.508 --> 20:45.271
But l want to find Flotter.

20:45.344 --> 20:47.904
Don't argue
with your godfather.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.072
Come on, now.

20:53.185 --> 20:54.413
Take this to Lieutenant Torres.

20:54.486 --> 20:56.078
You'll find the phaser drills
in Cargo Bay 3.

20:56.154 --> 20:57.212
Aye, sir.

20:57.289 --> 20:59.052
Are you sure you
have time for this?

20:59.124 --> 20:59.988
l know you're busy.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.184
No problem.

21:01.226 --> 21:02.955
Glad to be of service.

21:06.398 --> 21:07.888
Maybe a shade bluer.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.992
And the head's
a little disproportionate,

21:11.103 --> 21:12.331
don't you think?

21:12.437 --> 21:15.497
We're not shooting
for an exact replica, Neelix.

21:15.607 --> 21:16.835
Artistic license.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.034
Sorry.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.806
Guess l shouldn't barge
into your kitchen

21:20.879 --> 21:22.540
and tell you how to cook.

21:22.614 --> 21:25.674
Flotter-- now there's a name
l haven't heard in a while.

21:25.751 --> 21:28.982
l used to be nuts about those
holostories when l was a kid.

21:29.054 --> 21:30.282
Did you see the one

21:30.355 --> 21:32.846
where Flotter suspects Trevis
to be a rubber tree?

21:32.958 --> 21:34.220
Not yet.

21:34.293 --> 21:37.023
He keeps trying to trip him
to see is if he'll bounce.

21:37.095 --> 21:38.858
Yeah, those two
were a lot of fun.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.363
Actually, the last scenario

21:40.432 --> 21:42.866
that Naomi chose was
pretty frightening.

21:42.934 --> 21:43.866
No fun at all.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.402
Kids love to be scared.

21:45.470 --> 21:46.869
Not Naomi.

21:46.938 --> 21:50.806
Computer, transfer the design
parameters to the replicator.

21:53.578 --> 21:55.011
How's she holding up?

21:55.080 --> 21:56.012
Fine.

21:56.081 --> 21:57.912
Right now, she's busy
with her homework.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.711
Neelix, what's wrong?

21:59.785 --> 22:02.151
Everything.
Everything's wrong!

22:02.254 --> 22:05.417
lon storms, crash landings,
alien attacks--

22:05.457 --> 22:08.221
a starship's no place
for a child.

22:09.261 --> 22:10.455
l don't know.

22:10.529 --> 22:12.793
l'd say Naomi's pretty lucky
to be growing up on Voyager.

22:12.864 --> 22:13.922
Lucky?

22:13.999 --> 22:14.966
Think about it.

22:15.067 --> 22:17.729
Think about all the things
she's experienced--

22:17.836 --> 22:19.497
stars being born, supernovas,

22:19.604 --> 22:23.040
life-forms no one from the Alpha
Quadrant has seen before.

22:23.141 --> 22:25.837
When l was a kid,
l would have given anything

22:25.944 --> 22:27.673
for a chance like this.

22:27.746 --> 22:29.839
Well, here goes.

22:39.291 --> 22:40.815
Hi, Neelix.

22:40.892 --> 22:43.224
Did you miss me?

22:43.295 --> 22:46.059
You know, l forgot
how ugly this guy was.

22:46.131 --> 22:48.929
Thanks, Ensign.

22:58.944 --> 23:00.844
Naomi.

23:02.047 --> 23:04.174
Guess who l found
in the replicator.

23:04.249 --> 23:05.773
Thanks,

23:05.917 --> 23:09.478
but that's not really Flotter.

23:09.554 --> 23:12.921
Well, Flotter's
not really Flotter.

23:12.991 --> 23:15.983
He's just a holodeck character.

23:16.061 --> 23:18.495
What are you working on?

23:18.563 --> 23:20.793
l'm researching
the evaporation of water.

23:20.899 --> 23:22.799
Why?

23:22.901 --> 23:24.664
Well, l've been thinking.

23:24.770 --> 23:27.796
Water doesn't just
disappear when it's heated.

23:27.973 --> 23:29.838
lt turns into invisible gas.

23:29.975 --> 23:33.411
So, if we could get the
forest to cool down enough,

23:33.512 --> 23:35.207
Flotter might reliquefy.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.907
Clever.

23:39.818 --> 23:42.048
l miss Mom.

23:42.120 --> 23:43.849
l know you do.

23:43.955 --> 23:46.219
When's she coming back?

23:48.727 --> 23:50.092
Soon.

23:50.162 --> 23:52.357
Why hasn't she called?

23:52.431 --> 23:54.729
She must be very busy

23:54.800 --> 23:57.792
cataloguing all the geological
specimens she's collected.

23:57.903 --> 24:00.394
Has anybody talked to her?

24:02.307 --> 24:06.243
Well... not in a day
or two, but...

24:06.344 --> 24:08.778
''Starfleet Regulation 47 6-9:

24:08.880 --> 24:11.644
''All away teams must
report to the Bridge

24:11.716 --> 24:14.276
at least once every 24 hours.''

24:14.352 --> 24:16.946
You really are going to make an
excellent Captain's Assistant.

24:17.022 --> 24:19.388
What if something bad
happened to them?

24:19.458 --> 24:22.586
l'm sure everything's fine.

24:22.661 --> 24:24.652
Come on now, bed.

24:24.729 --> 24:27.323
Promise to wake me up
if Mommy calls?

24:27.399 --> 24:28.491
Promise.

24:28.567 --> 24:30.535
Even if it's 0200 hours?

24:30.602 --> 24:33.332
Even if it's 0200 hours.

24:33.438 --> 24:35.906
Sweet dreams.

24:38.944 --> 24:41.037
Neelix?

25:10.876 --> 25:15.074
Computer, access
Personal Database Neelix.

25:15.146 --> 25:16.670
File index 291.

25:18.383 --> 25:19.782
Hello, Alixia.

25:19.918 --> 25:23.877
l'm sorry it's been
so many weeks

25:23.955 --> 25:25.422
since l've thought about you,

25:25.490 --> 25:27.583
but we've been very busy
here on Voyager.

25:27.659 --> 25:30.560
l miss you.

25:30.629 --> 25:35.430
My goddaughter, Naomi,
she's in trouble.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.695
We're in trouble.

25:39.104 --> 25:42.267
She may lose her mother.

25:42.340 --> 25:46.333
Alixia, you always knew
the right thing to do,

25:46.444 --> 25:48.275
the right thing to say.

25:51.316 --> 25:52.749
l wish you were here to help me.

26:05.664 --> 26:07.131
Come on!

26:07.198 --> 26:08.631
Hurry!

26:13.104 --> 26:14.503
We're under attack!

26:18.376 --> 26:20.139
Get up!

26:24.182 --> 26:26.776
The metreon cascade!
Run!

26:58.383 --> 26:59.941
Computer, switch
to polythermal imaging

27:00.018 --> 27:01.918
and enhance resolution.

27:01.987 --> 27:04.649
Neelix, do you require
assistance?

27:04.723 --> 27:07.453
No, no, l was just passing by.

27:07.525 --> 27:10.824
l thought l'd pay you a visit,
see how things were going.

27:10.895 --> 27:12.886
How are things going?

27:12.964 --> 27:15.057
l'm mapping the caverns
surrounding the crash site.

27:15.133 --> 27:17.101
How far do they extend?

27:17.168 --> 27:19.568
Approximately 37 kilometers.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.471
What about the search--
anything new?

27:22.540 --> 27:24.440
Every scan reveals
something new,

27:24.509 --> 27:26.409
but as yet, little of relevance.

27:28.279 --> 27:30.270
Seven...

27:30.348 --> 27:33.943
your family--
your human family--

27:34.019 --> 27:36.283
do you ever think about them?

27:36.354 --> 27:38.515
lnfrequently.

27:38.590 --> 27:41.286
l was only six years old
when l was assimilated.

27:41.359 --> 27:44.328
Not much older
than Naomi is now.

27:44.396 --> 27:46.660
Do you miss your parents?

27:46.731 --> 27:49.029
l barely remember them.

27:49.134 --> 27:51.534
Maybe that's a blessing.

27:53.571 --> 27:55.038
Rescue team alpha
to Seven of Nine.

27:55.106 --> 27:56.198
Yes, Commander.

27:56.307 --> 27:57.899
We need that data.

27:58.009 --> 28:01.103
l will meet you
at the transporter site.

28:03.181 --> 28:05.206
l adapted.

28:05.283 --> 28:08.150
The child Naomi
will adapt as well.

28:08.219 --> 28:10.278
Borg wisdom.

28:15.627 --> 28:18.391
Lieutenant, get me
an update from beta team.

28:18.463 --> 28:20.988
They haven't checked in
for over an hour.

28:21.066 --> 28:22.090
Coffee, anyone?

28:22.167 --> 28:23.600
Captain?

28:23.702 --> 28:25.101
No, thanks. l've had enough.

28:25.170 --> 28:26.967
One more cup
and l'll jump to warp.

28:27.038 --> 28:27.970
Any news?

28:28.039 --> 28:29.631
l'm afraid not.

28:29.741 --> 28:32.301
No debris, no life signs?

28:32.377 --> 28:34.470
We've got three teams
beneath the surface

28:34.546 --> 28:35.570
and so far, nothing.

28:35.647 --> 28:38.343
Well, so much
for that happy ending.

28:38.416 --> 28:41.317
We'll turn that planetoid
inside out if we have to,

28:41.386 --> 28:44.617
but l think we have to be
prepared for the worst.

28:44.689 --> 28:46.987
Maybe it's time you told Naomi.

28:47.058 --> 28:49.049
No, not yet.

28:49.127 --> 28:50.389
She's an astute girl.

28:50.462 --> 28:52.589
She must be aware that
something's wrong by now.

28:52.664 --> 28:54.632
She's been asking
a lot of tough questions.

28:54.699 --> 28:56.690
''Why hasn't her mother
filed a status report?''

28:56.801 --> 28:57.961
''What if she's in trouble?''

28:58.069 --> 29:00.128
But l've got a big day
planned for her tomorrow.

29:00.238 --> 29:01.296
Plenty of distractions.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.567
She won't have time
to be worried.

29:03.641 --> 29:05.632
Your mission was
to keep her occupied,

29:05.744 --> 29:06.711
not to lie to her.

29:06.778 --> 29:08.177
First thing in the morning,

29:08.246 --> 29:10.214
l want you to explain
the situation.

29:10.281 --> 29:12.715
l don't think
that's such a good idea.

29:12.817 --> 29:14.512
Why not?

29:14.586 --> 29:17.248
Like l told you,
she's sensitive.

29:17.322 --> 29:19.552
All the more reason
to answer her questions.

29:19.624 --> 29:23.253
With all due respect, Captain,
l'm her godfather.

29:23.328 --> 29:25.558
l know what's best for her.

29:27.098 --> 29:29.225
Neelix...

29:39.310 --> 29:40.971
l realize you care about Naomi

29:41.045 --> 29:43.240
and you are only
trying to protect her,

29:43.314 --> 29:45.407
but you've got
to tell her the truth.

29:47.452 --> 29:48.714
''Good morning, Naomi.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.687
''Would you like some papalla
juice with your cereal?

29:50.755 --> 29:51.779
''And, oh, by the way,

29:51.856 --> 29:53.551
your mother is buried
under 30 kilotons of rock.''

29:53.625 --> 29:54.717
Neelix...

29:54.793 --> 29:56.317
When we know something
for sure...

29:56.394 --> 30:01.127
when we find her mother,
alive or dead...

30:01.199 --> 30:04.794
l'll tell her then.

30:04.903 --> 30:06.268
Not before.

30:06.337 --> 30:08.805
lf you can't do it, l will.

30:08.907 --> 30:10.670
You don't have the right!

30:10.742 --> 30:13.711
You don't understand
what's at stake here!

30:13.812 --> 30:14.744
When you were her age,

30:14.813 --> 30:16.280
you were safe
and sound on Earth

30:16.347 --> 30:18.542
with two healthy parents
to take care of you.

30:18.616 --> 30:19.810
You never had to worry

30:19.884 --> 30:21.852
about the possibility
of being alone!

30:21.953 --> 30:24.717
You take it from me--
you wouldn't have liked it.

30:26.257 --> 30:27.189
Oh, l know.

30:27.258 --> 30:30.955
You must identify
with Naomi's situation.

30:33.565 --> 30:38.525
When my family was killed,
l lost everything.

30:38.603 --> 30:40.798
l still have nightmares.

30:40.905 --> 30:43.874
lt hasn't been easy.

30:43.975 --> 30:46.409
l don't want Naomi
to go through what l did.

30:46.477 --> 30:49.674
l understand and you're right,

30:49.747 --> 30:53.911
but this situation is different.

30:53.985 --> 30:55.316
How so?

30:59.257 --> 31:00.986
Naomi has you.

31:01.092 --> 31:04.323
Neelix, she has to be told,

31:04.362 --> 31:06.523
but l know she'll be better off

31:06.598 --> 31:09.431
having you here
to help her through it.

31:12.770 --> 31:15.068
First thing in the morning.

31:15.139 --> 31:17.607
We've got a few hours
until then.

31:17.709 --> 31:20.678
Why don't you come
back on the Bridge?

31:20.745 --> 31:21.973
Give us a hand?

31:25.516 --> 31:26.983
Ready, Tuvok?

31:27.051 --> 31:28.848
Ready.

31:35.126 --> 31:36.684
Cross your fingers.

31:40.431 --> 31:43.195
The magnetic relays
have overloaded.

31:43.301 --> 31:45.769
We better find another way
to polarize this hull

31:45.870 --> 31:48.236
or their sensors
won't be able to pick us up.

31:48.306 --> 31:49.773
We're never getting out of here.

31:49.841 --> 31:52.503
Do not give up hope.

31:52.577 --> 31:54.772
The probability
of our being rescued is low,

31:54.846 --> 31:56.507
but not statistically
impossible.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.549
Comforting.

31:58.616 --> 32:00.675
Who's going to look after Naomi?

32:00.785 --> 32:03.151
You should not concern yourself
with that now.

32:03.187 --> 32:05.178
How can you say that?

32:05.256 --> 32:06.416
My youngest child

32:06.491 --> 32:09.426
has been without a father
for four years,

32:09.494 --> 32:11.792
yet l am certain
of her well-being,

32:11.930 --> 32:16.264
that l conveyed my values
to her before leaving,

32:16.334 --> 32:18.029
and l have confidence
in the integrity

32:18.136 --> 32:19.626
of those around her.

32:19.737 --> 32:23.195
You have been an exemplary
mother to Naomi

32:23.308 --> 32:27.472
and she is in the hands
of people you trust.

32:27.545 --> 32:33.780
She will survive and prosper,
no matter what becomes of us.

32:36.054 --> 32:38.284
Thanks, Tuvok.

32:46.230 --> 32:47.925
Mom!

32:50.668 --> 32:52.329
Neelix?

33:06.918 --> 33:09.148
Computer, locate Neelix.

33:09.220 --> 33:11.154
Neelix is on the Bridge.

33:11.222 --> 33:12.416
Thanks.

33:28.706 --> 33:31.641
Strickler, we need
three more phaser drills.

33:31.709 --> 33:34.007
You two, pattern enhancers
and medkits.

33:34.078 --> 33:35.443
Aye, sir.

33:35.513 --> 33:39.609
We're going to have
to recalibrate these tricorders.

33:41.886 --> 33:43.513
Put us with the alpha team.

33:43.588 --> 33:44.850
Setting coordinates.

33:44.956 --> 33:46.651
Energize.

33:59.504 --> 34:01.267
Deck 1, Bridge.

34:07.311 --> 34:08.744
Chakotay to Voyager.

34:08.813 --> 34:12.146
We found what looks like a piece
of the starboard nacelle.

34:12.216 --> 34:13.945
Any sign of the shuttle itself?

34:14.018 --> 34:15.143
Not yet.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.152
Captain, the cavern has
collapsed ahead of us.

34:17.221 --> 34:19.553
However, l am reading a hull
signature behind the debris.

34:19.623 --> 34:21.216
The Flyer?.

34:21.292 --> 34:22.884
l'll need to take
a closer reading.

34:22.960 --> 34:25.326
Do it. l want alpha and beta
teams to search for survivors.

34:25.396 --> 34:27.887
Tell Sick Bay to stand by
for heavy casualties.

34:30.467 --> 34:31.196
Naomi?

34:33.804 --> 34:34.998
Naomi...

34:44.916 --> 34:46.315
Naomi?

34:50.221 --> 34:52.121
Computer, locate Naomi Wildman.

34:52.190 --> 34:54.784
Naomi Wildman
is in her quarters.

35:13.511 --> 35:14.842
Clever.

35:18.249 --> 35:19.910
Computer, resume program

35:19.984 --> 35:22.714
''Flotter, Trevis
and the Ogre of Fire.''

35:22.787 --> 35:24.084
Program activated.

35:25.857 --> 35:28.189
Commander, l'm reading
duranium alloys.

35:28.259 --> 35:29.886
l believe it is the shuttle.

35:29.961 --> 35:32.657
Approximately 80 meters
beneath this rubble.

35:32.730 --> 35:33.924
Life signs?

35:33.998 --> 35:35.590
None.

35:35.666 --> 35:37.657
Commander, without
life signs to lock on to,

35:37.735 --> 35:39.327
we cannot beam the crew out.

35:39.437 --> 35:41.098
Maybe we can transport
the entire ship

35:41.205 --> 35:42.137
to the shuttle bay.

35:42.206 --> 35:44.674
Through 50 kilotons of bemonite?

35:46.978 --> 35:48.275
Chakotay to Voyager.

35:48.346 --> 35:49.711
Janeway here.

35:49.780 --> 35:51.304
We think
we've found the shuttle,

35:51.382 --> 35:52.576
but we need to dig it out.

35:52.650 --> 35:55.175
Have all teams rendezvous
at my coordinates.

35:55.253 --> 35:56.242
Acknowledged.

35:56.320 --> 35:59.778
Phaser drills here and here.

35:59.857 --> 36:03.725
But, hey, B'Elanna,
look on the bright side.

36:03.861 --> 36:06.022
No more day-old pizza
laying around.

36:08.499 --> 36:11.730
And you'll never have
to watch another chapter

36:11.869 --> 36:13.564
of Captain Proton again.

36:13.671 --> 36:16.902
Warning. Life support
has fallen to critical levels.

36:16.974 --> 36:18.771
Don't mind the computer.

36:18.843 --> 36:21.505
She's just jealous
that l'm spending

36:21.579 --> 36:24.241
my last few minutes
talking to you.

36:28.719 --> 36:30.152
So long.

36:35.226 --> 36:36.488
Sam...

36:38.529 --> 36:40.520
it's your turn.

36:40.598 --> 36:45.092
l... haven't thought
what to say yet.

36:45.203 --> 36:48.001
Tuvok, why don't you go next?

36:49.040 --> 36:52.407
l prefer to make my farewells
in written form.

37:06.591 --> 37:08.616
Computer, begin recording.

37:08.693 --> 37:12.185
Encode message
for delivery to Naomi Wildman.

37:12.263 --> 37:14.891
Acknowledged.

37:14.966 --> 37:16.456
Hi, honey.

37:16.567 --> 37:19.536
l know you're feeling sad
right now,

37:19.604 --> 37:24.166
but l want you to listen
to me very carefully, okay?

37:27.144 --> 37:30.705
First of all, l love you.

37:32.483 --> 37:37.944
Second, l want you to know
that l'm proud of you,

37:38.022 --> 37:41.423
how smart you are, how funny,

37:41.492 --> 37:43.790
how kind you are
to other people.

37:43.928 --> 37:46.294
And l know that you are going
to grow up

37:46.364 --> 37:48.059
to do extraordinary things.

37:51.235 --> 37:56.605
Last-- and l know
this is a hard one--

37:56.674 --> 37:58.835
try not to be scared.

37:58.976 --> 38:02.844
Warning. Oxygen depletion
in ten minutes.

38:02.947 --> 38:04.574
Listen to Neelix.

38:04.615 --> 38:07.709
He'll be taking care of you now.

38:10.688 --> 38:12.656
Bye, honey.

38:23.200 --> 38:24.599
Naomi?

38:24.702 --> 38:26.670
Go away!

38:26.771 --> 38:28.068
Where is she?

38:28.139 --> 38:31.108
She doesn't want to talk to you.

38:31.175 --> 38:32.301
You lied.

38:32.376 --> 38:34.367
l thought you vaporized.

38:34.445 --> 38:37.505
Naomi reliquefied me.

38:37.581 --> 38:38.980
Now leave.

38:39.050 --> 38:40.347
Computer, delete characters.

38:40.418 --> 38:41.976
Unable to comply.

38:42.053 --> 38:44.749
Holodeck controls
have been encoded.

38:45.956 --> 38:47.981
Delete us?

38:48.059 --> 38:49.993
l wonder if this liar can swim?

38:50.061 --> 38:53.792
We could always hang him
from one of my branches.

38:53.898 --> 38:55.126
Naomi.

38:56.901 --> 38:58.562
Please let me talk to you.

38:58.669 --> 39:00.830
lt's okay.

39:00.938 --> 39:02.906
You be nice.

39:03.007 --> 39:04.941
No more lying.

39:19.557 --> 39:20.922
Hey, there.

39:20.991 --> 39:23.357
ls my mother dead?

39:24.762 --> 39:27.026
We don't know.

39:27.098 --> 39:29.032
What happened?

39:29.100 --> 39:32.331
The away team was trying
to avoid an ion storm.

39:32.436 --> 39:34.404
They had to land on a planet.

39:34.472 --> 39:36.099
l saw that crater.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.175
Something was burning.

39:38.275 --> 39:42.211
Plasma fires,
pieces of debris...

39:42.279 --> 39:44.247
but not the hull.

39:46.851 --> 39:49.513
Until we know
for sure what's happened,

39:49.587 --> 39:52.249
no one's giving up
on the rescue attempt.

39:52.323 --> 39:54.723
You really think
they might find her?

39:56.627 --> 39:59.528
Yes.

39:59.597 --> 40:00.689
How do l know

40:00.765 --> 40:02.824
you're telling me
the truth this time?

40:08.205 --> 40:10.196
l...

40:10.307 --> 40:13.333
l never told you this before...

40:13.444 --> 40:16.845
but when l was much younger,

40:16.914 --> 40:20.509
l lost my mom
in a terrible war...

40:20.584 --> 40:23.348
my father
and my sisters, too.

40:25.156 --> 40:29.752
lt was the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

40:29.827 --> 40:31.761
Always wondering...

40:31.829 --> 40:33.296
How did they die?

40:33.364 --> 40:35.730
Were they worried about me?

40:35.800 --> 40:38.860
Could they still be alive?

40:39.036 --> 40:42.597
l thought if l could just
keep you from wondering...

40:42.706 --> 40:45.197
you wouldn't have to feel
what l did.

40:45.309 --> 40:48.472
You were pretending
that nothing was wrong...

40:48.546 --> 40:50.411
that nothing bad happened.

40:50.481 --> 40:52.346
Do you ever pretend

40:52.416 --> 40:54.748
that nothing bad happened
to your family?

40:56.587 --> 40:58.020
Sometimes.

40:58.088 --> 40:59.487
Does it help?

41:00.491 --> 41:01.753
Not really.

41:03.027 --> 41:05.427
Don't be sad, Neelix.

41:08.365 --> 41:09.923
All hands to emergency stations.

41:10.034 --> 41:12.366
We've got a level-8
ion storm approaching.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.835
lon storm? What's that?

41:13.904 --> 41:14.836
The Ogre of Fire.

41:14.939 --> 41:16.338
He's attacking us again.

41:16.407 --> 41:18.432
We'd better get back
to your quarters.

41:18.542 --> 41:19.474
Naomi.

41:19.543 --> 41:21.010
Don't leave us.

41:21.078 --> 41:22.841
l'll be back.
l promise.

41:27.351 --> 41:28.318
Voyager to Chakotay.

41:28.385 --> 41:29.443
Go ahead.

41:29.520 --> 41:31.283
We've got another
ion storm approaching.

41:31.355 --> 41:32.583
When it hits the planetoid,

41:32.656 --> 41:34.749
your entire cavern
is going to destabilize.

41:34.825 --> 41:35.849
Just a few more meters

41:35.993 --> 41:38.518
and we'll be close enough
to beam out the shuttle.

41:38.596 --> 41:40.063
How long before the storm hits?

41:40.130 --> 41:41.324
Six minutes.

41:41.398 --> 41:44.595
Make the most of it,
because it's all you've got.

41:52.309 --> 41:54.072
The storm is moving in.

41:54.144 --> 41:56.237
Shields down to 86 percent.

41:56.313 --> 41:58.304
Keep a transporter lock
on the away team.

41:58.382 --> 41:59.906
We'll give them
till the last second.

42:00.050 --> 42:02.712
Helm, lay in a course
out of here.

42:02.753 --> 42:04.277
Stand by to engage at warp 2.

42:04.321 --> 42:05.413
Aye, sir.

42:05.489 --> 42:09.186
Warning. Oxygen depletion
in two minutes.

42:09.260 --> 42:12.696
l never thought it would
come down to this--

42:12.763 --> 42:15.527
suffocating beneath
kilotons of rock

42:15.599 --> 42:17.658
on some nameless planetoid.

42:17.768 --> 42:21.465
Did you envision
a more heroic death?

42:21.572 --> 42:24.439
l didn't envision dying at all.

42:24.508 --> 42:28.774
ln accepting the inevitable,
one finds peace.

42:30.381 --> 42:33.350
lf that's another
Vulcan saying, Tuvok,

42:33.417 --> 42:35.977
l'll stick with
''live long and prosper.''

42:40.724 --> 42:45.024
We're here.
We're here!

42:45.095 --> 42:46.187
Chakotay to Voyager.

42:46.263 --> 42:47.195
Yes, Commander.

42:47.264 --> 42:49.129
Pattern enhancers are in place.

42:49.199 --> 42:51.258
We're ready to transport
the Flyer.

42:51.368 --> 42:52.460
Locking on.

42:56.640 --> 42:59.404
They're in the shuttle bay.

42:59.476 --> 43:00.841
Helm, engage.

43:22.333 --> 43:23.800
Thank you.

43:29.974 --> 43:31.839
Captain's Log, supplemental.

43:31.909 --> 43:35.003
Ensign Wildman has recovered
from her injuries

43:35.079 --> 43:38.378
and the Delta Flyer,
though battered, is intact.

43:38.449 --> 43:40.474
And how are you today,
Mr. Trevis?

43:40.551 --> 43:43.645
Feeling a little stiff,
my slippery friend. And you?

43:43.721 --> 43:46.451
Well, now that you mention it,
l'm feeling a little washed out.

43:48.359 --> 43:50.190
Well, it's about time
you showed up.

43:50.260 --> 43:52.125
The tea is getting cold.

43:52.196 --> 43:54.061
Samantha?

43:54.131 --> 43:55.689
ls it really you?

43:55.766 --> 43:57.358
Long time no see.

43:57.468 --> 43:58.628
You're all grown up.

43:58.736 --> 43:59.862
l'm an Ensign now.

44:00.004 --> 44:01.403
l missed you.

44:01.505 --> 44:02.904
Likewise.

44:02.940 --> 44:04.737
Well, now that everyone's
reacquainted,

44:04.808 --> 44:06.776
l bet you're all eager
for a new adventure.

44:06.910 --> 44:08.343
Now that you mention it,

44:08.412 --> 44:10.778
there is a castle that l've
been meaning to explore.

44:10.914 --> 44:11.881
Castle?

44:11.949 --> 44:13.780
l hear a giant beetle
lives there.

44:13.917 --> 44:15.509
Come on, Neelix.

44:15.586 --> 44:16.712
You go ahead.

44:16.787 --> 44:17.754
See you later.

44:20.658 --> 44:22.558
Here's to happy endings.

44:22.626 --> 44:24.560
Captain!

44:24.628 --> 44:27.096
Just checking on my future
Captain's Assistant.

44:27.164 --> 44:30.565
Well, right now, she's off
to conquer a giant beetle.

44:30.668 --> 44:34.263
Oh, sounds
like a dangerous mission.

44:34.371 --> 44:35.998
She can handle it.

44:36.106 --> 44:37.596
She's a courageous girl.

44:37.708 --> 44:39.175
Oh...

44:39.243 --> 44:41.143
Did l ever tell you
about the time

44:41.211 --> 44:42.838
l flooded this entire forest?

44:42.946 --> 44:44.072
l was six years old.

44:44.148 --> 44:46.616
Flotter claimed we were
in for a dry spell,

44:46.684 --> 44:48.845
so l came up
with the obvious solution.

44:48.986 --> 44:50.715
Why not just divert the river?

44:50.788 --> 44:54.155
This entire forest was a swamp
by the time we were done.

44:54.224 --> 44:55.851
At which point, Stinger...

44:55.959 --> 44:56.857
Stinger?

44:56.994 --> 44:58.256
The biggest mosquito...
