00:12.725 --> 00:14.386
Careful.

00:14.459 --> 00:16.068
You'll wreck my gift for
Princess Bubblegum.

00:16.093 --> 00:17.093
Whoops.

00:17.126 --> 00:18.889
Hey, what's it supposed
to be, anyway?

00:18.960 --> 00:21.757
It's a scale model of
The Candy Kingdom,

00:21.828 --> 00:24.990
made out of my saliva.

00:25.062 --> 00:28.996
So, this means you want to
give her your spit, huh?

00:29.063 --> 00:30.394
Yep. Hey, no!

00:30.464 --> 00:32.432
It's okay, dude. I
totally get it.

00:32.497 --> 00:33.658
Ha ha ha!

00:33.732 --> 00:35.359
I just wanted to
give her something,

00:35.432 --> 00:38.594
uh, to celebrate her science...
thing.

00:38.667 --> 00:41.658
You mean her... super
science barbecue?!

00:41.735 --> 00:43.327
You think it's sciencey
enough for her?

00:43.402 --> 00:45.029
Relax. She'll love it.

00:45.103 --> 00:46.933
And then she'll love you.

00:47.003 --> 00:48.283
- Wha?!
- Hey, there's Bubblegum.

00:51.171 --> 00:52.933
Hide it behind your back, man.

00:55.339 --> 00:56.601
Princess!

00:56.673 --> 00:57.935
Oh. Hi, guys.

00:58.007 --> 01:01.032
Just getting the grill
cooking for tonight's BBQ.

01:01.108 --> 01:02.040
Oh.

01:02.108 --> 01:04.905
What's that you got behind
your back there, Finny?

01:04.974 --> 01:07.239
Oh, I-I made you something.

01:07.310 --> 01:09.073
Really?! Can I scope it?

01:09.144 --> 01:10.702
Yes. Close your eyes.

01:10.778 --> 01:11.710
A'ight.

01:11.778 --> 01:13.473
Get ready to open your eyes?

01:13.545 --> 01:15.444
Ah-choo! Can I open my eyes?

01:15.512 --> 01:16.877
No, wait!

01:16.946 --> 01:20.608
Uh, keep them closed for
like three more hours.

01:20.681 --> 01:23.046
I'm gonna open my eyes.

01:23.115 --> 01:24.810
Oh, Finn!

01:24.882 --> 01:26.543
It's pink! I love pink!

01:26.616 --> 01:29.516
Oh, thanks, Finn.

01:29.584 --> 01:31.552
Princess, Princess!

01:31.618 --> 01:33.642
Better not say nothing, you.

01:33.718 --> 01:35.379
Yes, Chet?

01:35.452 --> 01:38.579
Um, so, I called
Grill-meister for the BBQ,

01:38.654 --> 01:40.747
but Pepper won't
give up the spatula.

01:40.821 --> 01:43.084
Fine, fine. You can have it...

01:43.155 --> 01:45.089
when you pry it from
my cold, dead hands!

01:45.156 --> 01:46.714
N-o-o-o-o!

01:46.790 --> 01:50.054
Hey, if you two aren't
watching the grill,

01:50.124 --> 01:52.285
then who's watching the...
grill?!

01:56.393 --> 01:57.393
Meat!

02:00.661 --> 02:03.027
Die, you fire!

02:03.095 --> 02:05.187
Finn, that was awesome.

02:05.262 --> 02:06.820
Oh.

02:06.896 --> 02:08.830
Thanks, Princess. I'm
always happy to help.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.364
I see.

02:10.431 --> 02:13.991
Your heroic brain is fascinating
in a scientific way.

02:14.066 --> 02:16.556
Many scientific minds
are going to be

02:16.633 --> 02:18.123
speaking at my barbecue.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.724
You should talk about
something, too.

02:20.801 --> 02:22.701
You'll do that for me, right?

02:22.769 --> 02:24.396
Anything you want.

02:24.469 --> 02:26.096
Thanks, Finn.

02:27.737 --> 02:30.227
Listen, I have to
deal with this.

02:30.305 --> 02:31.499
See you tonight?

02:31.571 --> 02:33.163
Uh, yeah.

02:35.307 --> 02:37.604
Buddy, just breathe into me.

02:37.674 --> 02:39.369
Huh?

02:39.441 --> 02:40.806
You're just gonna give a speech

02:40.875 --> 02:42.604
to a bunch of brainiacs.

02:42.676 --> 02:44.268
I can't hang with those guys.

02:44.343 --> 02:45.934
I'm full of stupid.

02:46.009 --> 02:47.601
Then we'll just
borrow some brains

02:47.677 --> 02:50.111
by going to the place
where knowledge lives!

02:50.178 --> 02:51.702
Oh, Braintown.

02:51.779 --> 02:53.643
Uh, no, the library.

02:53.712 --> 02:56.180
The library of the undead.

02:56.247 --> 02:59.181
No, just the regular library.

03:05.683 --> 03:06.912
Hey, Finn, let's split.

03:06.984 --> 03:09.076
This turned out to be boring.

03:09.151 --> 03:10.618
But I have to cram this info.

03:10.685 --> 03:12.380
Okay, okay.

03:12.452 --> 03:14.919
I'll just keep reading
this book about figs.

03:14.986 --> 03:17.954
And I'll just read
this book about pigs.

03:31.458 --> 03:33.016
Ha ha! Whatcha doing?

03:33.092 --> 03:34.457
I'm bored now, too.

03:37.827 --> 03:39.454
Shh, hey!

03:39.528 --> 03:41.587
That's completely inappropriate.

03:41.662 --> 03:45.687
But... but we were just
enthusiastic about learning.

03:45.763 --> 03:46.889
Hmm.

03:46.964 --> 03:48.955
So, if I can't
book-learn for beans,

03:49.031 --> 03:50.895
we'll just get some smarty

03:50.965 --> 03:52.263
to <i>explain</i> scientific
junk to me.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.323
Yeah, then you can at
least sound smart.

03:54.399 --> 03:56.492
But where you gonna
find someone like that?

03:56.567 --> 03:59.660
Jake, we're going to college.

03:59.735 --> 04:02.259
And the great question endures.

04:02.336 --> 04:04.361
Who would win in a fight

04:04.436 --> 04:08.371
between Nietzsche's
Ubermensch and Mandroid?

04:08.438 --> 04:10.667
The answer is Werewolf Queen.

04:10.738 --> 04:12.501
It's always Werewolf Queen.

04:12.572 --> 04:13.572
Rad!

04:17.440 --> 04:19.704
Jake, you can just
shrink yourself down.

04:19.774 --> 04:22.470
Oh, yeah.

04:22.542 --> 04:24.635
And when I finally meet
the Werewolf Queen,

04:24.710 --> 04:27.576
she will take me on
as her royal consort,

04:27.644 --> 04:29.305
and we will rule in blood!

04:29.378 --> 04:32.073
Hey, teach, can you talk
more about scientific,

04:32.145 --> 04:34.579
uh, stuff and things?

04:34.646 --> 04:36.375
Well, sure, I could...

04:36.447 --> 04:38.108
if this wasn't a class

04:38.181 --> 04:39.739
on Theoretical Fight-onomics.

04:39.815 --> 04:40.679
Oh.

04:40.748 --> 04:43.342
Are you even in this
class, Mister...

04:43.416 --> 04:45.440
Uh... Wormy...

04:45.516 --> 04:46.778
Wormy McSquirmy.

04:46.850 --> 04:48.215
McSquirmy, huh?

04:48.284 --> 04:50.514
Well, we'll just see about that.

04:50.585 --> 04:51.950
Oh, there you are.

04:52.019 --> 04:53.748
W. Mcsquirmy. I'm sorry.

04:53.820 --> 04:55.048
Yes, you're registered,

04:55.120 --> 04:57.815
and you haven't shown
up for a single class.

04:58.988 --> 05:02.423
Truancy hurts us all, McSquirmy.

05:02.489 --> 05:05.321
Hey! Ow! Please, where's
your compassion?

05:05.390 --> 05:06.982
- Let's kill him.
- Assail!

05:07.957 --> 05:09.720
Excelsior!

05:09.791 --> 05:10.622
Ohh!

05:10.692 --> 05:11.818
Aah!

05:15.893 --> 05:17.656
Jake, let's get out of here.

05:17.728 --> 05:19.320
Ow!

05:19.395 --> 05:21.329
And stay out of academia!

05:21.395 --> 05:22.328
Ugh!

05:22.396 --> 05:24.159
Well, that's it.

05:24.230 --> 05:26.220
I'm all out of ideas on
how to learn this junk.

05:26.297 --> 05:28.822
Oh! Let's just solve
this thing with magic.

05:28.898 --> 05:31.195
No. That's the easy way out.

05:31.265 --> 05:33.324
Yeah. It's the easy way out.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.697
Oh. Oh, yeah!

05:34.767 --> 05:38.223
Let's go visit Choose Goose
and his magical shack.

05:38.301 --> 05:39.768
Magic, you say?

05:40.736 --> 05:42.669
Yeah, Choose Goose.

05:42.736 --> 05:45.398
I need magic... some kind
of mind-enhancing magic.

05:45.471 --> 05:49.667
Oh, yes, the quest that
you are on requires...

05:49.739 --> 05:52.172
the glasses of Nerdicon!

05:53.139 --> 05:55.039
So, I just put those on,

05:55.107 --> 05:57.575
and then I'd be able
to give that lecture.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.801
And Princess Bubblegum
will totally dig it.

05:59.875 --> 06:00.807
Yeah!

06:00.875 --> 06:02.900
What do you want for it, C.G.?

06:02.976 --> 06:05.239
Lately, I've been
feeling drained.

06:05.310 --> 06:08.836
I only wish to be entertained.

06:08.911 --> 06:10.503
Hmm.

06:10.579 --> 06:11.841
Oh!

06:17.081 --> 06:20.344
Oh!

06:20.415 --> 06:21.780
Well done.

06:21.849 --> 06:24.647
The glasses you have won!

06:40.255 --> 06:43.712
Everything small is just a small
version of something big!

06:43.790 --> 06:44.950
I understand everything!

06:45.024 --> 06:46.787
Whoa, bud, are you okay?

06:46.858 --> 06:48.883
Oh, Jake, I'm better than okay.

06:48.958 --> 06:50.983
I know exactly how to
impress The Princess.

06:51.059 --> 06:53.425
- More spit bubbles?
- No, no.

06:53.493 --> 06:54.983
Those spit bubbles
were as fragile

06:55.060 --> 06:56.527
as my old perception of reality.

06:56.594 --> 06:58.255
But wait. Maybe you're
onto something.

06:58.328 --> 06:59.604
I could show the
Princess bubbles

06:59.628 --> 07:01.391
the likes of which no
one has ever seen!

07:01.462 --> 07:02.952
And how will you do that?

07:03.030 --> 07:04.998
I'll start with a
solid bulleted list.

07:09.565 --> 07:12.658
Thanks again to Dr.
Dextrose for sharing

07:12.733 --> 07:15.223
your fascinating research
on the future of cuteness.

07:15.300 --> 07:17.359
Yes, yes, how charming.

07:17.435 --> 07:18.993
What quaint notions.

07:21.669 --> 07:23.261
And now for a special
guest lecture

07:23.337 --> 07:26.499
by one of Ooo's
greatest heroes...

07:26.571 --> 07:28.163
Finn, the human!

07:29.439 --> 07:30.929
Ladies and gentlemen...

07:31.006 --> 07:32.633
and Princess,

07:32.706 --> 07:36.163
I'm here to talk about
multidimensional bubbles.

07:36.241 --> 07:39.971
But I am not just going to
talk about blowing bubbles.

07:40.043 --> 07:42.977
I'm going to blow your minds.

07:43.044 --> 07:44.238
Hmm?

07:44.310 --> 07:47.472
This is a bubble blower
of my own design.

07:47.545 --> 07:51.445
With this, you can blow bubbles
in different dimensions.

07:54.180 --> 07:59.047
This two-dimensional bubble
casts a one-dimensional shadow.

08:01.116 --> 08:05.710
A three-dimensional bubble casts
a two-dimensional shadow.

08:08.285 --> 08:10.219
A fourth-dimensional
bubble casts

08:10.286 --> 08:13.152
a three-dimensional shadow.

08:13.220 --> 08:16.120
It is beyond comprehension!

08:16.188 --> 08:18.451
Beyond space! Beyond time!

08:18.522 --> 08:20.888
Finn, that would mean
you've created...

08:20.956 --> 08:21.956
Yes, a black hole!

08:24.190 --> 08:25.623
Whoa!

08:31.692 --> 08:32.955
Whoa!

08:33.027 --> 08:35.051
Finn, do something!

08:35.126 --> 08:36.287
It's okay.

08:36.361 --> 08:38.522
I'm sure the solution is
on my bulleted... list!

08:40.761 --> 08:41.761
Don't worry.

08:41.797 --> 08:43.957
I have everything under control.

08:44.030 --> 08:45.998
Under control?!

08:46.065 --> 08:47.726
My guests are terrified.

08:47.799 --> 08:49.061
Yes!

08:49.132 --> 08:51.076
And their brains are releasing
adrenaline, dopamine,

08:51.100 --> 08:54.000
even dimethyltryptamine
from the pineal gland!

08:54.068 --> 08:56.228
This has serious
educational value.

08:56.301 --> 08:57.859
Thanatophobia and this N.D.E.

08:57.935 --> 09:00.096
is giving us euphoric
altered awareness.

09:00.170 --> 09:01.864
Don't you see, Princess?

09:01.936 --> 09:04.495
We were all born to die!

09:04.571 --> 09:06.367
You're trying to kill us all?

09:06.438 --> 09:08.030
No, of course not.

09:08.105 --> 09:11.198
I'm trying to give you the
greatest conference ever!

09:11.273 --> 09:14.366
Finn, you've gone insane.

09:14.441 --> 09:15.874
What?! No way.

09:15.941 --> 09:18.301
I'm, like, the smartest guy in
Ooo, thanks to these glasses.

09:18.342 --> 09:19.570
Glasses?

09:19.643 --> 09:21.633
Finn, take those off.

09:21.709 --> 09:23.108
You're not yourself.

09:23.177 --> 09:25.509
- But...
- Please!

09:25.578 --> 09:28.239
I need the <i>real</i> you.

09:33.281 --> 09:36.578
What's going on? Whoa?!

09:36.648 --> 09:39.481
You blew it, Finn, with this.

09:39.549 --> 09:41.483
Then I'll kill it with <i>this.</i>

09:42.950 --> 09:44.474
Be careful.

09:44.551 --> 09:46.314
Finn! Look out!

09:48.819 --> 09:50.753
Wha?

09:50.820 --> 09:52.583
Fourth dimensional!

09:52.654 --> 09:53.814
Jake, let me go!

09:53.887 --> 09:56.354
Finn, don't do anything stupid!

09:56.421 --> 09:58.685
I can't help it, man.

09:58.756 --> 10:00.348
I'm all about stupid.

10:00.423 --> 10:02.515
Yeah!

10:02.590 --> 10:03.590
Finn!

10:09.593 --> 10:14.459
Finn, my science
barbecue was a fiasco.

10:17.595 --> 10:18.926
That was incredible.

10:18.995 --> 10:23.226
That was the greatest
conference ever!

10:24.431 --> 10:25.921
What's this?

10:25.998 --> 10:27.988
"Make hyper bubble,
cause black hole,

10:28.065 --> 10:30.192
become insane, P.B.
takes off the glasses,

10:30.266 --> 10:33.234
save the day, win the
heart of the Princess"?

10:33.301 --> 10:35.393
Finn, you knew all
this would happen?

10:35.468 --> 10:37.129
Huh? Knew what?

10:37.202 --> 10:40.967
I wrote that list when I
was insane with smartness.
