00:02.200 --> 00:04.521
My name is Oliver Queen.

00:04.680 --> 00:06.682
After five years in hell...

00:06.840 --> 00:09.047
...I have come home with only one goal:

00:09.200 --> 00:10.850
to save my city.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.287
Now others have joined my crusade.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.568
To them, lam Oliver Queen.

00:15.720 --> 00:18.724
To the rest of Starling City,
lam someone else...

00:18.880 --> 00:22.123
...I am something else.

00:22.280 --> 00:23.611
Previously on Arrow:

00:23.760 --> 00:25.967
A lot of good people,
they lose someone.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.963
They come in here to work off that rage.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.964
Roy, are you okay?
You look a little tired.

00:31.120 --> 00:32.884
I just haven't been sleeping much lately.

00:33.040 --> 00:36.761
If I had accepted my life,
I would be a cocktail waitress in Vegas...

00:36.920 --> 00:39.526
...and I never would have believed
some crazy guy in a hood...

00:39.720 --> 00:42.451
...when he told me
I could be more than just some IT girl.

01:05.960 --> 01:09.931
- You're not moving very quickly this morning.
- I just didn't sleep much last night.

01:17.680 --> 01:20.365
You're not boxing, Laurel.
You're not even fighting.

01:20.520 --> 01:22.761
You're just lashing out. Come on.

01:26.480 --> 01:28.005
Impressive.

01:28.160 --> 01:30.811
How do normal people spend their morning?

01:31.560 --> 01:33.005
Eight, nine...

01:33.160 --> 01:34.525
Foun

01:34.680 --> 01:37.763
Come on, ladies, you're almost there...
And 10.

01:37.920 --> 01:40.400
- Five. Ungh.
- Good. Very good.

01:40.840 --> 01:42.205
Yes!

01:42.360 --> 01:44.601
Hold your core strong, push that back in...

01:48.560 --> 01:49.971
Mrs. Fernandes...

01:50.120 --> 01:55.160
...I already told you I
haven't seen your cat.

01:55.320 --> 01:56.924
I haven't seen him either.

01:57.080 --> 01:58.206
Or is the cat a girl?

01:58.360 --> 02:01.523
Was I being misogynistjust now?
Or is it misogynistic? I never know.

02:01.720 --> 02:04.121
Ray, what are you...?

02:04.280 --> 02:05.805
Nice place. Lots of space.

02:05.960 --> 02:08.201
So, what's the one thing
Queen Consolidated has...

02:08.360 --> 02:10.806
...that we don't use
to its maximum potential?

02:10.960 --> 02:14.681
- A doorbell?
- Have you heard of cogeneration?

02:15.200 --> 02:17.726
I haven't even looked
at a cup of coffee yet.

02:17.880 --> 02:20.167
- Cogeneration is a...
- The repurposing...

02:20.320 --> 02:22.721
...of waste heat given off
by electricity production.

02:22.880 --> 02:26.089
A principle of thermodynamic efficiency,
which occurred to me...

02:26.240 --> 02:30.040
...could be applied to a building
which generates over 240,000 watts...

02:30.200 --> 02:32.601
...like Queen Consolidated.
Mmhm.

02:32.760 --> 02:37.084
I, uh, did some preliminary calculations
on the drive over.

02:37.680 --> 02:40.889
You wanna sell QC's excess energy
back to the city?

02:41.040 --> 02:43.611
If by sell, you mean
give away for free, yes.

02:43.760 --> 02:46.411
Energy is something
that should be given freely to the masses.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.765
Uh, you still haven't found Mrs.
Fernandes' cat, I'm guessing.

02:59.760 --> 03:02.889
- Oh, my beautiful girl!
- Very friendly with your neighbors, I see.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.530
- Mom...
- Mom?

03:04.680 --> 03:07.251
- ...what are you doing here?
- Honey, I came to see you.

03:08.240 --> 03:11.961
For a visit. Look. Didn't you get my text?

03:12.120 --> 03:16.011
Mom, to send a text, you actually have
to press "send" on the text.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.925
Oh, okay. Not a big deal.
I'll do it right now.

03:22.800 --> 03:25.087
- Are you adopted?
- Oh.

03:25.240 --> 03:28.005
I'm so sorry. I didn't know you
had somebody staying over.

03:28.160 --> 03:32.006
Oh, no, he's not staying over.
He's not... Like, we're not...

03:32.160 --> 03:34.527
- This is my boss.
- Pleasure to meet you, Ms. Smoak.

03:34.680 --> 03:37.490
- Hi. You can call me Donna.
- Mom.

03:37.640 --> 03:40.530
- I'm Ray.
- Oh, my God. Palmer?

03:41.600 --> 03:44.604
- You're that watch guy.
- We like to call them smart wearables.

03:44.760 --> 03:47.969
I bought one of your watches! Look!

03:49.320 --> 03:52.164
Felicity here thinks I don't pay attention
to all of her techie things.

03:53.960 --> 03:58.249
Yeah, I see you've got a 3GS. I'm actually
wearing a prototype for the new 6.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.244
- It basically replaces your computer.
- Very fancy.

04:01.400 --> 04:05.200
- You know what? It's yours.
- Oh, no. Seriously?

04:08.320 --> 04:10.163
I'll let you two catch up.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.641
Let me know what you think
about those numbers...

04:12.800 --> 04:15.610
- ...and, Donna, hope to see you again.
- Wouldn't count on it.

04:15.760 --> 04:18.240
She'll probably be really busy,
planning my funeral...

04:18.440 --> 04:21.410
...after I die of embarrassment.

04:21.920 --> 04:27.211
You are standing in an open field
west of a white house...

04:27.360 --> 04:30.682
...with a boarded front door.

04:30.840 --> 04:31.921
What are you doing?

04:32.120 --> 04:34.646
I just finished coding
a Linux emulator for Zork.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.647
Hmm. "it is pitch black.

04:38.400 --> 04:41.483
You are likely to be eaten...

04:42.640 --> 04:45.325
...by a grue."
I guess you'll have to protect me.

04:45.800 --> 04:49.964
Why can't you just quietly have sex under
a comforter like most college students?

04:53.600 --> 04:55.011
You found an exploitable node?

04:55.160 --> 04:58.130
Now I just need your super computer virus
to crack the firewall.

04:58.280 --> 05:02.001
I really wish you wouldn't call my X-axis
bionumeric algorithm a super virus.

05:02.160 --> 05:06.722
Spoofing the IF', switching to MD6, and...

05:07.480 --> 05:09.209
Somebody take a screenshot.

05:09.360 --> 05:12.603
We have to post this to Hackerforum
to brag that we actually got in.

05:12.760 --> 05:16.560
- Hold on.
- Thirty seconds until the firewall goes back up.

05:17.440 --> 05:18.726
Cooper, what are you doing?

05:18.920 --> 05:21.730
The world would be a much better place
without student loans.

05:21.920 --> 05:25.242
You can't wipe out all the loans.
They're gonna track us down.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.243
- Ten seconds.
- Cooper!

05:27.400 --> 05:30.802
I'm not going to jail for you, Cooper.
And you shouldn't either.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.406
- Coop!
- I almost had it.

05:35.600 --> 05:36.886
What were you thinking?

05:37.800 --> 05:39.040
Ever heard of hacktivism?

05:39.200 --> 05:42.522
Instead of posting to web forums,
we could be doing some real good.

05:42.680 --> 05:44.682
And going to prison in the process.

05:44.840 --> 05:49.050
It's all about what you wanna be
when you grow up, babe. A hacker or a hero?

05:55.560 --> 05:57.050
Hello?

05:58.160 --> 05:59.844
Speedy?

06:01.360 --> 06:03.966
Just signed the lease. What do you think?

06:04.120 --> 06:08.842
Thea, you're signing a lease on a spot
that you can't possibly afford.

06:09.960 --> 06:13.203
- I can, actually.
- With whose money?

06:13.360 --> 06:15.806
Malcolm Merlyn's. His estate, I mean.

06:15.960 --> 06:19.248
When I left Starling City,
I mentioned something to Ned Foster...

06:19.440 --> 06:21.169
...about Malcolm being my father...

06:21.320 --> 06:25.166
...and there was a lot of legal stuff
I didn't understand...

06:25.360 --> 06:28.967
- He left you money?
- The entire world thinks he's dead, so...

06:29.120 --> 06:31.805
...yes, legally, his estate goes
to his last living heir.

06:31.960 --> 06:37.251
And, ahem, last week when you told me that you
had investors for the club, that was a lie?

06:37.400 --> 06:40.688
I was afraid you wouldn't react well
to the idea of me taking his money.

06:40.840 --> 06:44.481
It's blood money, Thea. You don't know
what Malcolm Merlyn is capable of.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.722
I know what his money is capable of.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.766
Renting me this really sweet loft.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.604
Listen to me. He's alive.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.929
And if you take his money,
he has a hold on you.

06:55.080 --> 06:57.242
I think you're being a little melodramatic.

06:57.760 --> 07:01.526
I'm his daughter, okay?
He's not going to put me in danger.

07:01.680 --> 07:06.129
He's responsible for the death of 503
innocent people, including your brother.

07:06.320 --> 07:09.244
That is a card that you do not get to play.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.209
You are my brother...

07:11.360 --> 07:16.127
...but that does not mean you have the right
to tell me what I can do with my life.

07:16.280 --> 07:18.044
I am my own person.

07:18.200 --> 07:21.807
Movers are coming tomorrow,
so you can stop by with popcorn...

07:22.000 --> 07:23.570
...or not stop by at all.

07:45.480 --> 07:47.323
Oh, please.

07:47.480 --> 07:50.324
Good. So...?

08:06.080 --> 08:08.367
What is going on?

08:08.520 --> 08:10.045
Ollie?

08:29.560 --> 08:30.971
Are you okay?

08:38.039 --> 08:40.087
We are Brother Eye.

08:40.240 --> 08:42.607
Judgment has been rendered
against this city.

08:42.760 --> 08:44.762
A sentence carried out.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.122
An earthquake. A siege.

08:47.280 --> 08:49.044
This is what comes next.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.407
A new life you will live on your knees.

08:51.560 --> 08:55.884
And it will take nothing more
than the push of a button.

08:56.040 --> 08:58.646
We are in control now.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.041
And this is all just the beginning.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.680
Let there be light.

09:22.200 --> 09:25.010
Ooh. A nightclub. Heh.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.561
You know,
I'm really not dressed for a nightclub.

09:27.720 --> 09:28.926
- Really?
- You think?

09:30.200 --> 09:33.363
My friend owns the place. He just needs
a little help turning the power back on.

09:33.520 --> 09:34.567
Oh.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.444
Why don't you...

09:36.600 --> 09:38.762
...come, come, stay put?

09:38.920 --> 09:40.922
- Stay here?
- Right here.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.844
Okay. You gonna go?
Mm-hm.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.923
Hey, any luck tracking this...?

09:45.400 --> 09:46.845
Hello.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.966
Hi. Uh...

09:50.120 --> 09:52.043
- Please tell me this is your friend.
- No.

09:53.600 --> 09:56.001
- Mom, this is Oliver...
- Queen.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.926
- Very nice to meet you.
- Yes, it's so nice to meet you too.

10:00.080 --> 10:02.686
How many billionaires do you know?

10:03.480 --> 10:06.450
Diggle, uh, meet Felicity's morn.

10:08.520 --> 10:12.684
- Mom? John Diggle. Very nice to meet you.
- Hi. Nice to meet you too.

10:12.880 --> 10:16.168
Aw. Hello. Who is this little nugget?

10:16.320 --> 10:17.890
This is my daughter, Sara.

10:18.040 --> 10:22.125
- Mom? Mom? Mom!
- Oh. Aw. What?

10:23.360 --> 10:25.966
- We have to go downstairs.
- I didn't mean to stop you.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.327
I'm so sorry. Little baby moment. So sorry.

10:28.520 --> 10:31.683
- It's great to meet you, finally.
- Nice to meet you. Yes. Definitely.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.410
Why is Sara here?

10:33.560 --> 10:36.211
Lyla's on assignment,
and the nanny called in sick.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.846
But we can't bring her down there.

10:41.520 --> 10:44.251
- Why not, Oliver? Who's she gonna tell?
- Well, she...

10:44.920 --> 10:48.481
- I'm not comfortable with her down there.
- God help me.

10:48.640 --> 10:49.880
My mother loves babies.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.921
- Really?
- Whoever this Brother Eye group is...

10:56.080 --> 10:59.880
...got access to the city's protective
network and uploaded a system-wide virus.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.121
Any way to trace it?

11:01.280 --> 11:03.442
No, it deleted itself
as soon as it completed its task.

11:03.640 --> 11:07.929
- He said the power outage was the beginning.
- Let's find them before there's a next time.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.611
- Hey, Laurel, are you all right?
- I'm fine. I was close.

11:16.760 --> 11:20.367
But why did I get the alert?
Why didn't they call the district attorney?

11:20.520 --> 11:24.127
He's visiting his niece in Coast City.
You are the acting district attorney.

11:24.280 --> 11:26.203
Congratulations.

11:30.120 --> 11:31.849
Hello, detective. Captain.

11:32.040 --> 11:34.042
- You're on this Brother Eye thing?
- We are.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.567
Good. No one here knows computers
better than you.

11:38.320 --> 11:41.802
I gotta go. For the last time,
I am not interested in buying a fake ID.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.531
I am hanging up now. Bye.

11:46.520 --> 11:48.443
My mom says hi.

11:50.680 --> 11:53.650
- You still angry at me?
- I was into the account network.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.531
I had 3000 debts wiped
by the time you pulled the plug.

11:56.680 --> 12:00.446
Think of how many accounts you could go
to prison for if I hadn't stopped you.

12:01.720 --> 12:05.725
Relax. The DNS wasn't configured.
They can't backtrace me.

12:05.880 --> 12:08.406
They can. The subroot was configured.

12:08.560 --> 12:09.891
By accessing the accounts...

12:10.080 --> 12:13.209
...you set off a packets feedback
that anyone could trace back to you.

12:17.880 --> 12:20.201
You are gorgeous
when you're being a chicken.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.005
- I'm serious.
- I'm serious.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.160
- Cooper Seldon...
- FBI, don't move!

12:30.320 --> 12:32.687
- ...you're under arrest.
- What? No! Let go of me!

12:33.640 --> 12:34.687
No, no, no!

12:34.840 --> 12:38.162
You're under arrest for violation
of U.S. Code Title 18, Section 10-30.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.681
- Don't! It's not his!
- You have a right to remain silent.

12:40.840 --> 12:43.366
Let go of him! Let him go!

12:45.320 --> 12:48.290
We said this was just the beginning.

12:48.440 --> 12:51.205
Electricity is not the only power
in this city.

12:51.360 --> 12:53.931
Consider money, for example.

12:54.120 --> 12:56.521
The banks are next to go dark.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.444
Your beloved dollars wiped away...

12:58.600 --> 13:02.366
...as your accounts will finally
all be equal at zero.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.045
- Felicity.
- I'm working on it.

13:04.200 --> 13:07.841
I set up some trace IP packets.
As soon as he opened the channel...

13:08.000 --> 13:10.367
...I scooped up the crumbs.
Crumbs we can follow?

13:10.520 --> 13:11.965
I hope so.

13:15.240 --> 13:18.528
- Where's Captain Lance?
- Coordinating squad car patrols for Dispatch.

13:18.680 --> 13:21.729
- Why, what's wrong?
- There's a situation at Starling National.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.405
Send in an ESU squad.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.004
- Sorry, but you don't have the power to...
- I'm acting district attorney.

13:27.200 --> 13:31.524
The city charter gives me operational authority
in times of crisis, which this clearly is.

13:31.680 --> 13:35.844
And I'm not letting anyone get hurt.
Send in an ESU now.

13:40.200 --> 13:44.091
- What's going on?
- S.C.P.D. dispatched a riot squad.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.368
That's like fighting a fire with gasoline.

13:46.520 --> 13:47.851
Suit up.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.924
This group has been ordered to disperse.

13:59.080 --> 14:02.243
Go back inside! Get back behind the line!

14:03.440 --> 14:06.762
Oliver, the riot is getting
out of control. You need to hurry up.

14:06.920 --> 14:10.720
You are trespassing!
Please disperse immediately.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.410
We will use force!

14:16.520 --> 14:18.124
Get away from the bank!

14:32.240 --> 14:35.449
Tear gas is dispersing them,
but we can't calm the entire city.

14:35.640 --> 14:39.281
The trace led me to the virus they're
using. It is a mile past complex.

14:39.480 --> 14:41.164
I'm combing through now.

14:42.600 --> 14:45.251
- No, no, no.
- What's wrong?

14:46.200 --> 14:48.601
The virus, I can't stop it.

14:48.760 --> 14:50.683
- How do you know?
- Because it's mine.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.481
I wrote it five years ago.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.041
Okay, before you say anything,
just know that...

15:05.200 --> 15:08.488
...I never imagined the virus being used
for something like this.

15:08.640 --> 15:11.723
I mean, sure, I could have imagined it.
I have a very vivid imagination.

15:11.880 --> 15:14.326
Like Cronuts, I had a vision of them...
Hey.

15:15.960 --> 15:17.689
Relax.

15:17.840 --> 15:19.490
Take a deep breath.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.683
Good. Now start at the beginning.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.571
I was in this,
I guess you could call it a group...

15:27.720 --> 15:31.281
...in college. We were hacktivists.

15:31.440 --> 15:33.681
For lack of a better word.

15:33.840 --> 15:36.605
Civil disobedience via the World Wide Web.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.323
I created this...

15:41.200 --> 15:42.361
...this...

15:43.800 --> 15:46.007
...super virus.

15:47.120 --> 15:50.522
It could give us root access
to any infected server.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.682
We could expose government fraud...

15:52.840 --> 15:56.367
...and start virtual sit-ins
and digitally deface criminals.

15:57.320 --> 16:01.041
I guess you could say it was
my first attempt at being a hero.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.361
Felicity...

16:03.040 --> 16:05.042
...why didn't you tell
me about any of this?

16:07.560 --> 16:11.121
Do we even know a fraction of what happened
to you the five years you were away?

16:12.040 --> 16:15.249
- Who else had access to the program?
- Myron Forest.

16:15.400 --> 16:19.962
He was my... I had a boyfriend in college,
and Myron was his roommate.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.049
And he was a member
of this hacktivist group?

16:22.720 --> 16:24.688
What about the boyfriend?

16:24.840 --> 16:27.081
Oh, he couldn't have done this. He's...

16:27.240 --> 16:30.369
...not in the picture,
but Myron always had somewhat of an edge.

16:30.960 --> 16:32.564
Can you give me an address?

16:33.400 --> 16:34.890
Sure.

16:39.560 --> 16:41.449
There's one small problem.

16:41.640 --> 16:45.201
Not small necessarily, but short.
Just take the alleyway entrance.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.131
Are you okay?

17:09.280 --> 17:11.123
I've been better.

17:11.280 --> 17:15.490
I talked it over with Myron, and I'm going
to tell them I wrote the super virus.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.484
You can't do that.

17:18.079 --> 17:22.801
- I can't let you rot in prison, Coop.
- You can't tell them you wrote that virus.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.769
Because I already told them I did.

17:25.240 --> 17:28.961
- Cooper...
- I always said I'd protect you from the grues.

17:29.120 --> 17:32.010
- This isn't...
- It's better this way.

17:32.640 --> 17:36.725
I wiped out those loans. There's no reason
both of us should be in prison.

17:39.160 --> 17:40.525
I love you.

17:40.680 --> 17:41.966
I love you too.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.641
Hey. Got a minute?

18:00.160 --> 18:03.004
Congratulations, you called in a riot
squad, you nearly started one...

18:03.160 --> 18:05.322
...and you did it behind my back.

18:05.520 --> 18:09.161
You were busy, and the situation
at Starling National was escalating.

18:09.320 --> 18:13.166
You escalated it, Laurel! Please tell
me you can at least see that now.

18:13.360 --> 18:14.691
Okay.

18:16.040 --> 18:19.203
- I'm sorry.
- Laurel, baby...

18:21.280 --> 18:25.080
...what's gotten into you? You're
angry, you're distant, you're reckless.

18:25.240 --> 18:27.368
Tell me you're not boozing again.

18:27.800 --> 18:30.201
- No.
- Then what the hell's going on?

18:30.360 --> 18:31.600
Because this isn't you.

18:31.760 --> 18:34.889
Look, I haven't said anything.
I was hoping you would say something...

18:35.040 --> 18:38.886
...because you are in 1O different kinds
of pain and you won't talk about it.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.404
I can't talk about it with you.

18:48.200 --> 18:51.568
Okay, listen, you don't have
to talk about it with me.

18:51.720 --> 18:53.210
But talk about it with somebody.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.802
Because secrets hurt, baby,
sometimes more than the truth.

19:09.240 --> 19:11.242
Backup generator keeps that locked.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.721
Or so they told me.

19:13.920 --> 19:17.049
I could never get that stupid door to open.

19:17.520 --> 19:21.241
Contractor says the entire sublevel's
flooded, though. A water-main break.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.565
What are you doing here, Ollie?

19:23.760 --> 19:27.207
A super hacker's trying to take over
the city and I'm worried about you.

19:29.320 --> 19:33.041
- I still get to be worried, right?
- Yes.

19:33.200 --> 19:37.250
And if you really have to,
you can even be judgmental.

19:37.440 --> 19:39.090
Occasionally.

19:39.280 --> 19:45.242
But someone told me recently
that family is pretty precious.

19:45.400 --> 19:49.041
And love, in spite of everything,
is what makes it precious.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.965
Right now the Queen family
is just you and me.

19:52.600 --> 19:55.888
So let it just be you and me.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.844
And don't take Merlyn's money.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.607
I'm trying to meet you halfway here, Ollie.
The other half is up to you.

20:28.640 --> 20:30.165
Myron Forest...

20:30.320 --> 20:33.005
...you have failed this city.

20:36.600 --> 20:40.161
He has to retract all the infected packets
from subsystem mainframes.

20:40.320 --> 20:43.529
Tell me how to shut down the virus.
Do it now.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.563
You think I'm behind the cyber attacks?

20:45.760 --> 20:48.604
- Sounds like a Brother Eye to me.
- I swear to God, I'm not.

20:48.760 --> 20:51.081
I head up the IT department
of an accounting firm.

20:51.240 --> 20:52.526
I drive a hybrid. It's blue.

20:52.680 --> 20:56.002
I'm one of the sheep lunatics
like these guys hate. Why would I do this?

20:56.160 --> 20:58.162
His fingerprints are all over this code.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.408
It's an X-axis bionumeric algorithm.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.848
The code's an X-axis bionumeric algorithm
that you've used before!

21:04.680 --> 21:06.250
In college.

21:07.240 --> 21:09.288
My roommate, his girlfriend. Yeah.

21:09.440 --> 21:13.411
We developed it, we called it a super virus,
but that doesn't mean I'm the Eye guy.

21:13.560 --> 21:16.564
- Have you tried Felicity Smoak?
- She's innocent.

21:16.720 --> 21:18.643
Then it's gotta be someone else.

21:18.800 --> 21:22.122
After we graduated, I might have showed
the code off to a few people.

21:22.280 --> 21:25.011
- Who were they?
- I don't remember. It was five years ago.

21:25.160 --> 21:29.210
I didn't think it was a big deal.
We were just kids playing with matches.

21:32.680 --> 21:34.569
I'm running out of expletives.

21:34.720 --> 21:36.882
Track down whoever
Myron shared your code with.

21:37.040 --> 21:38.929
I hacked all of his e-mails and texts...

21:39.080 --> 21:41.560
...from five years ago,
and all I got was depressed.

21:41.720 --> 21:44.929
- Okay, what about your ex?
- I already told you, he didn't do it.

21:45.080 --> 21:47.287
Why? Because he's your ex-boyfriend?

21:47.760 --> 21:49.000
Because“.

21:50.760 --> 21:54.606
...my senior year of college,
Cooper and I did a stupid thing.

21:55.840 --> 21:58.286
He got arrested and he went to prison.

21:58.440 --> 22:01.091
So he went to prison. Maybe he got out.

22:01.560 --> 22:02.607
He didn't.

22:02.760 --> 22:05.411
- How do you know?
- Because he's dead.

22:08.240 --> 22:10.242
He hung himself before sentencing.

22:11.880 --> 22:13.370
Felicity...

22:14.920 --> 22:17.924
I just really need to be alone right now.

22:27.440 --> 22:30.364
Oh. I'm glad you're here.

22:30.520 --> 22:33.205
I launched my plan to rebrand Starling
into Star City.

22:33.360 --> 22:36.330
Didn't count on cyber terrorism.

22:37.480 --> 22:41.280
Uh, I'm looking for a partner
with whom to drown my sorrows...

22:41.440 --> 22:44.967
...and you definitely look like someone
who could use a drink.

22:46.120 --> 22:47.565
I'm sorry.

22:49.840 --> 22:53.640
My mother...
I didn't have anywhere else to go.

22:56.120 --> 22:57.804
You Okay?

23:00.160 --> 23:01.446
You're an inventor.

23:02.120 --> 23:06.603
Did you ever create anything
that you didn't think was important...

23:06.760 --> 23:08.171
...turns out...

23:09.040 --> 23:10.804
...it's very important?

23:11.360 --> 23:12.646
Of course.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.642
Those turned out to be the best inventions.

23:15.800 --> 23:17.211
Not always.

23:17.360 --> 23:19.124
You wanna talk about it?

23:23.200 --> 23:24.611
Of course I'd find you here.

23:25.160 --> 23:27.970
- Could you just wait one second?
- Wait?

23:29.480 --> 23:32.165
I've already waited two hours for you
at your apartment...

23:32.320 --> 23:35.164
...and before that,
it was two hours in that club.

23:36.880 --> 23:39.611
Is there any way
that you could be anywhere else but here?

23:46.160 --> 23:48.003
Thanks, Mom.

23:48.840 --> 23:50.683
That wasn't the least bit mortifying.

23:50.840 --> 23:53.525
Only half as bad as Parents' Weekend
freshman year.

23:53.680 --> 23:55.364
Well, I'm sorry.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.447
I'm sorry I've been reduced
to stalking my own daughter.

23:59.600 --> 24:04.083
Because you can't seem to comprehend
that I can't make the whole world stop...

24:04.240 --> 24:07.289
...because you decided to show up
on my doorstep.

24:07.440 --> 24:09.283
I have responsibilities.

24:09.440 --> 24:12.046
Yes, I know, Felicity, you have work.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.965
- You have work, work, work...
- No, no, you don't understand.

24:15.120 --> 24:18.044
It is so much more than work.

24:18.200 --> 24:21.602
All you care about is my love life
or how much cleavage I don't show.

24:21.760 --> 24:24.730
- That is not true.
- That is completely true!

24:24.880 --> 24:27.804
I'm sorry that I'm terminally single.
I'm sorry I have an actual job.

24:27.960 --> 24:31.726
I'm sorry that I don't dress like a porn
star, which is a compliment to you.

24:31.880 --> 24:35.771
I am so sorry
that I am such a disappointment to you!

24:40.400 --> 24:43.961
I'm not as smart as you, Felicity,
or your father.

24:44.120 --> 24:45.770
I know that.

24:46.280 --> 24:49.489
When you were only 6 years old,
I could barely keep up with you two.

24:49.640 --> 24:51.244
And...

24:52.400 --> 24:55.927
...maybe I wasn't always the mother
you wanted, but I was always there.

24:56.080 --> 24:59.971
I stayed, and I tried. He...

25:02.640 --> 25:03.846
He left me.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.447
He left us.

25:08.280 --> 25:10.442
But when I look at you...

25:12.040 --> 25:16.409
...all I see is what he gave you.
There's nothing of me...

25:17.400 --> 25:18.925
...in you.

25:19.400 --> 25:21.402
You know, it's so funny, I was...

25:22.600 --> 25:27.606
I was always so afraid that one day
you were gonna leave me too. Heh.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.841
And now I finally realize...

25:34.560 --> 25:36.130
...you already did.

25:52.160 --> 25:55.721
There are people on the other end
of this thing, right? People we can hit?

25:55.880 --> 25:57.484
We need Felicity.

25:57.640 --> 25:58.846
I'm here.

25:59.480 --> 26:02.768
My super virus has
3407 traceable access nodes.

26:02.920 --> 26:05.764
Hopefully, I didn't put a firewall
on every one, though.

26:05.920 --> 26:08.161
Of course I did,
because I'm smarter than that.

26:08.320 --> 26:11.767
Seriously, if I had two less IQ points,
we never would have gotten in this mess.

26:11.960 --> 26:15.282
- Are you all right? Where's your mom?
- I don't know.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.804
Probably back at my place...

26:17.960 --> 26:20.770
...wishing she had a different daughter.
It's a long story.

26:20.920 --> 26:23.366
- Go see her. Take an hour.
- The city is under attack.

26:23.560 --> 26:26.006
You're our best chance of stopping it,
but not like this.

26:26.160 --> 26:28.845
- Your head's not in the game.
- I will get it together.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.721
Your tracer hack's running.
Take an hour. Go talk to your mom.

26:33.640 --> 26:36.007
I do not have anything to say to her.

26:36.160 --> 26:40.961
You know, earlier today, Thea told me
that she literally has to put up with me...

26:41.160 --> 26:43.049
...because family is precious.

26:43.240 --> 26:46.403
And that it's love, in
spite of everything...

26:46.560 --> 26:48.210
...that makes it precious.

26:50.800 --> 26:52.040
Go.

27:02.160 --> 27:05.369
- Where's Sara?
- The nanny came to pick her up.

27:06.160 --> 27:09.369
Said he was from a company called
A.R.G.U.S. I don't know. Never heard of it.

27:09.560 --> 27:11.369
I think that's the point.

27:12.400 --> 27:13.731
Well, I'm glad you're still here.

27:15.400 --> 27:18.210
You are a terrible liar, Felicity.

27:21.360 --> 27:23.522
Might be the only thing we have in common.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.240
I have blond hair.

27:26.120 --> 27:27.724
You dye it.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.484
You're right.

27:31.560 --> 27:34.564
We're different, and it's always
gonna be that way, and it's not easy...

27:34.720 --> 27:35.926
No, you know what?

27:36.080 --> 27:39.243
It's totally my fault
forjust showing up here uninvited.

27:39.400 --> 27:42.609
Seriously, I think I just got so excited
about this free flight.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.240
What?

27:46.240 --> 27:50.040
My plane ticket. I got an e-mail that said
I'd won some contest...

27:50.200 --> 27:53.443
...free first-class round trip to Starling.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.443
E-mail?

27:58.320 --> 28:00.482
Mom. Morn...

28:00.640 --> 28:02.051
...someone wanted you to be here.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.569
- No!
- Mom!

28:08.120 --> 28:09.167
MQfn!

28:15.960 --> 28:18.122
- Baby!
- Mom!

28:18.280 --> 28:19.884
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

28:20.040 --> 28:21.121
Oh, thank God.

28:23.960 --> 28:25.724
Where are we? Oh, honey.

28:27.960 --> 28:31.362
Felicity Smoak.
Just the woman I wanted to see.

28:31.560 --> 28:34.006
What the hell do you want from me?
Who are you?

28:34.160 --> 28:35.764
You really don't know?

28:40.640 --> 28:43.086
I thought you never forget your first love.

28:50.600 --> 28:52.170
You died.

28:54.440 --> 28:56.807
They told me...
That I committed suicide, right?

28:57.000 --> 28:59.844
The NSA needed a hacker
with game for cyber espionage...

29:00.000 --> 29:03.163
...and I needed to not be in prison
for the rest of my life.

29:03.520 --> 29:08.731
Because of what the NSA wanted me doing,
it was advantageous for me to be dead.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.689
When I found out you died...

29:10.840 --> 29:12.922
...I was devastated.

29:13.880 --> 29:15.086
I loved you.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.290
I loved you too.

29:17.480 --> 29:20.962
After I finished my time with the NSA,
I was gonna find you.

29:22.080 --> 29:23.320
To let you in on this.

29:23.480 --> 29:27.326
And then I discovered
you'd become this corporate lapdog.

29:27.480 --> 29:30.484
It broke my heart. You changed.

29:30.640 --> 29:34.122
If you thought I was capable of doing this,
you never really knew me at all.

29:34.280 --> 29:38.365
When you wrote this virus, Felicity,
you knew exactly what it was capable of.

29:38.520 --> 29:41.285
All I'm doing is unleashing
the true potential of what you made.

29:41.440 --> 29:44.523
Why?! This isn't who you are.

29:44.680 --> 29:48.287
Five years with the NSA,
you learn a lot about how the world works.

29:48.440 --> 29:51.011
How it can't be saved or salvaged.

29:51.160 --> 29:52.969
How it's every man for himself.

29:53.400 --> 29:58.611
You also learn that when a city bank
goes under, say, financial cyber attack...

29:58.760 --> 30:01.650
...the mayor will reach out
to the Treasury Department...

30:01.800 --> 30:04.167
...and request an influx of fresh cash.

30:04.360 --> 30:07.489
Cash, which is transported
by armored trucks...

30:07.640 --> 30:10.484
...navigating according
to a closed-end GPS system...

30:10.640 --> 30:12.881
...which directs them to City Deposit.

30:13.080 --> 30:17.369
If the drivers deviate from the route,
the trucks are shut down.

30:19.240 --> 30:24.087
But you are going to hack into the system
and direct the cash to come here.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.846
- It was about money, and I'm the sellout?
- No.

30:27.320 --> 30:30.927
No, babe.
You're the one who's gonna help me.

30:31.080 --> 30:34.129
See, breaking into the treasury's
asymmetric encryption...

30:34.280 --> 30:36.169
...is beyond even my capabilities.

30:36.320 --> 30:38.288
I'm going to politely decline.

30:40.920 --> 30:44.766
- Don't!
- That's why I flew some motivation into town.

30:48.120 --> 30:49.929
She's been MIA for over an hour.

30:50.080 --> 30:53.368
You did tell her to go home.
I had an A.R.G.U.S. agent pick up Sara.

30:53.520 --> 30:55.887
- I could have them go back, check things out.
- Yeah.

31:03.680 --> 31:06.524
Felicity's never more than five feet
from her phone.

31:06.680 --> 31:08.364
Agh. Something's wrong.

31:13.800 --> 31:14.961
Ow!

31:19.560 --> 31:22.643
That terminal's configured to only connect
with the treasury's IP.

31:22.800 --> 31:26.361
I mention this so you don't try to do
anything stupid like alert the police.

31:26.520 --> 31:27.726
I'm so sorry.

31:27.880 --> 31:30.884
Mom, right now's
not really the best time, okay?

31:31.040 --> 31:33.930
But it might be the last time, hon,
and I want you to know...

31:35.240 --> 31:37.561
...that all I've ever wanted...

31:38.120 --> 31:39.565
...is for you to be happy.

31:40.880 --> 31:43.565
What say we hit pause
on the Dr. Phil episode?

31:43.720 --> 31:45.927
It's done. It's done.

31:47.960 --> 31:50.804
- That quick?
- There's a reason you wanted me, right?

31:50.960 --> 31:53.122
They'll be at your front
door in five minutes.

31:53.680 --> 31:55.170
Guards will be armed.

31:55.320 --> 31:58.164
- Let's go. Move out.
- I'll take the front.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.445
Stay put, okay?

32:06.600 --> 32:10.002
Just because we used to screw
doesn't mean I won't use this gun.

32:18.840 --> 32:20.080
What's that?

32:20.720 --> 32:22.563
Huh? Oh. Uh...

32:22.720 --> 32:25.451
It's the watch.
It's the watch Mr. Palmer gave me.

32:25.600 --> 32:28.683
It chimes on the hour and, I guess,
when we're about to be killed.

32:28.880 --> 32:31.281
We're not gonna be killed.
We're going to get out of here.

32:31.440 --> 32:34.808
- It basically replaces your computer.
- I don't know what that means.

32:34.960 --> 32:36.007
It means it has Wi-Fi.

32:37.800 --> 32:39.404
Really?

32:47.920 --> 32:49.524
Okay.

32:49.680 --> 32:52.524
When they're in range, you know what to do.

33:07.400 --> 33:09.971
I did what you wanted.
You don't have to kill us.

33:10.520 --> 33:12.090
Really?

33:15.000 --> 33:17.844
Who would've thought
that I'd become the grue?

33:18.000 --> 33:19.764
Hey! Hey.

33:19.920 --> 33:23.891
You wanna wave that gun at me, fine,
but don't you dare threaten my daughter.

33:27.960 --> 33:30.008
Here I thought you were all nails and hair.

33:30.160 --> 33:32.606
Try single mom
who's worked 60-hour weeks for tips...

33:32.760 --> 33:35.081
...in order to raise that genius child
you see right there.

33:37.960 --> 33:41.806
I mean, I don't understand all this
cyber-whatever, but I know without that gun...

33:41.960 --> 33:44.770
...you wouldn't last 10 seconds
against my girl.

33:44.920 --> 33:47.207
Too bad she doesn't have 1O seconds.

33:47.360 --> 33:48.691
I disagree.

33:48.880 --> 33:51.645
Put the gun down.

33:52.200 --> 33:53.850
You were always good, Felicity.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.286
So good.

33:55.440 --> 33:57.568
But so am I.

34:03.840 --> 34:06.923
Motion-sensored.
They can hit most any target.

34:18.400 --> 34:20.004
Come on.

34:21.239 --> 34:22.650
Something's wrong.

34:22.800 --> 34:24.643
All right, boys, light them up!

34:56.760 --> 34:58.125
Clear.

35:17.280 --> 35:19.169
This is all your fault.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.041
No.

35:26.200 --> 35:28.885
Mom, are you okay? Are you...?

35:31.160 --> 35:32.400
On, baby.

35:49.920 --> 35:52.287
Before, you were right
to keep pressing on Cooper.

35:52.440 --> 35:54.488
Turns out he's not as dead as I thought.

35:54.640 --> 35:56.404
I've had some experience with that.

35:57.400 --> 35:59.129
And you learn not to judge.

36:00.360 --> 36:01.566
Yes.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.762
Are you okay?

36:05.840 --> 36:07.285
I guess so.

36:07.440 --> 36:09.761
Old lovers have a way
of opening old wounds.

36:11.720 --> 36:13.245
Lovers.

36:13.440 --> 36:15.602
Sounds creepy no matter how you say it.

36:18.200 --> 36:19.770
Felicity...

36:19.920 --> 36:24.244
...I want you to know that whatever experiences
you had to go through, I'm glad that you did.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.687
They shaped the person you are today.

36:26.840 --> 36:29.446
And you know how I feel about her.

36:30.360 --> 36:31.600
I should head out.

36:35.160 --> 36:36.605
You were right.

36:38.880 --> 36:41.281
We have to love our families.

36:41.680 --> 36:42.920
No matter what.

36:51.240 --> 36:52.969
Felicity.

36:53.400 --> 36:54.970
You here?

37:07.520 --> 37:09.170
What happened to you?

37:10.320 --> 37:11.526
This is me now.

37:22.400 --> 37:23.640
You were right.

37:26.600 --> 37:28.204
Something is going on with me.

37:28.720 --> 37:31.690
And my father, he noticed it as well.

37:31.840 --> 37:34.411
He told me I should open up to someone.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.841
My sister, she...

37:37.000 --> 37:38.525
She died.

37:39.880 --> 37:41.484
Well, she...

37:41.640 --> 37:43.005
She was murdered.

37:43.160 --> 37:47.051
- Did they ever catch the...?
- No. No one knows she's gone except for me.

37:47.240 --> 37:50.369
And I can't tell anyone. So yes.

37:50.520 --> 37:53.842
- Yes, I am angry.
- I'm gonna help you with that.

37:54.040 --> 37:56.361
See, before, you were swinging
at your sister's killer.

37:56.520 --> 37:58.363
That's a target you're never gonna hit.

37:58.520 --> 38:01.410
Don't train for that, all right?
Train for yourself.

38:02.880 --> 38:04.609
See, now I know how to teach you.

38:08.040 --> 38:09.883
So, what's it gonna be?

38:10.640 --> 38:12.051
Red or black?

38:12.200 --> 38:13.611
Black.

38:13.760 --> 38:15.683
Definitely black.

38:22.160 --> 38:27.485
Maybe I'm lost

38:27.640 --> 38:29.005
It was popcorn, right?

38:30.560 --> 38:33.564
You said you were meeting me halfway.
This is me doing my part.

38:36.200 --> 38:39.761
Maybe I'm lost

38:39.960 --> 38:41.200
Wow.

38:44.360 --> 38:45.646
I missed you, Speedy.

38:49.960 --> 38:52.008
Let's not miss each other anymore.

38:52.920 --> 38:57.244
It was so much easier to be in each other's
lives when we were underneath the same roof.

38:57.400 --> 39:01.086
So why don't you move in with me?

39:01.240 --> 39:04.084
I mean, clearly, I have enough space.

39:04.520 --> 39:06.727
And l...

39:06.880 --> 39:09.451
I swear,
once the club starts making a profit...

39:09.600 --> 39:12.763
...I will donate all of Malcolm's money...

39:12.920 --> 39:17.608
...to a earthquake-relief charity thing.

39:19.280 --> 39:20.611
I can live with that.

39:24.520 --> 39:26.488
You got a TV in here?

39:51.120 --> 39:53.248
Well, I'm officially off.

39:54.960 --> 39:58.806
My flight doesn't leave till tonight, but
I figured you'd be working, so we can...

39:59.440 --> 40:01.010
We can just say goodbye now.

40:03.960 --> 40:05.644
You were right.

40:08.320 --> 40:11.563
- About what?
- I haven't always been appreciative of you.

40:12.440 --> 40:15.683
You were always there for me
every day and night.

40:15.840 --> 40:18.650
So if I haven't said thank you enough...

40:18.800 --> 40:20.006
...thank you.

40:22.480 --> 40:24.005
But you were wrong too...

40:24.760 --> 40:25.966
Mm-hm.

40:26.120 --> 40:29.363
...when you said all you saw
in me was Dad...

40:29.520 --> 40:32.000
...and there was nothing of you in me.

40:32.160 --> 40:36.131
I can't really explain it, but over the
past two years, I have been through a lot.

40:36.280 --> 40:40.080
And I have learned
that I am a lot tougher than I thought.

40:41.680 --> 40:43.011
That"

40:43.520 --> 40:45.204
...I get from you.

40:48.360 --> 40:49.486
Don't cry.

40:49.640 --> 40:52.849
I took another look at those
cogeneration numbers. You wanna...?

40:53.560 --> 40:54.721
Oh.

40:54.880 --> 40:56.530
- Hi again.
- Hi.

40:56.720 --> 40:58.722
How's that new smart wearable
working out?

40:58.880 --> 41:00.291
Oh. It's, um...

41:00.440 --> 41:02.886
- it's a real lifesaver. Heh-heh.
- Yeah.

41:03.040 --> 41:04.246
Mm-hm.

41:05.480 --> 41:07.403
Ray, I can't come in to work today.

41:07.560 --> 41:08.561
I am...

41:11.720 --> 41:13.051
...calling in sick.

41:14.720 --> 41:17.246
- "Feel better."
- Heh. Thank you.

41:19.040 --> 41:20.690
See you later.

41:20.840 --> 41:24.242
Yeah, you need to do something
about that one.

41:24.400 --> 41:26.402
Mom. Shh.

41:27.680 --> 41:29.205
That's actually pretty genius.

41:29.920 --> 41:33.845
- Hello, Sara.
- What are you doing here?

41:34.760 --> 41:36.000
Hello, Sara.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.162
What are you doing here?
