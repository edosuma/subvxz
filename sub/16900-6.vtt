00:07.257 --> 00:09.718
You're my girl, right?
And I take care of you, huh?

00:09.885 --> 00:10.636
Who knows?

00:10.802 --> 00:12.971
Maybe we'll see Natalie Morales, you know?

00:13.138 --> 00:16.183
That little firecracker,
she gets my blood running
south of the border.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.976
That is less sweet.

00:18.143 --> 00:21.480
I'm gonna stop by tonight.
Maybe I'll pick up some Chinese.

00:21.647 --> 00:24.525
Aw, you said "Chinese"
instead of something offensive.

00:24.691 --> 00:27.861
Yeah, I told you,
losing you last year,
changed me, huh?

00:28.025 --> 00:32.070
It made me more,
um...more mature.

00:33.030 --> 00:34.535
Huh? Come here.

00:34.705 --> 00:38.499
Ow, that really hurts, Dennis.

00:42.628 --> 00:43.918
You're back with Dennis?

00:44.089 --> 00:46.632
Yeah, I'm back with Dennis.

00:46.798 --> 00:48.462
Don't look at me
with your eyebrows all up.

00:48.635 --> 00:49.423
It's so annoying.

00:49.596 --> 00:53.052
Yes, I'm annoying, not the man
who honked your boobs on the jumbo screen.

00:53.228 --> 00:56.091
That was before.
And it was the playoffs.

00:56.266 --> 00:58.052
Does he still work
at that beeper store?

00:58.226 --> 00:59.352
What is it,
"Beeper King"?

00:59.515 --> 01:00.350
He is the King now.

01:00.518 --> 01:03.683
The old Beeper King retired...
Well, technically he shot himself.

01:03.855 --> 01:06.600
But Dennis took over
and now he's the only beeper salesman

01:06.776 --> 01:09.442
left in Manhattan,
which is cool in a way.

01:09.617 --> 01:10.901
You're doing the eyebrow thing again.

01:11.076 --> 01:12.863
Because it's Dennis.
Who are you trying to fool?

01:13.036 --> 01:14.323
- This is me.
- Exactly.

01:14.497 --> 01:16.112
You don't get to
give dating advice.

01:16.285 --> 01:18.243
You sent a letter to Scott Peterson.

01:18.418 --> 01:21.702
After he dyed his hair
and got super thin from all the stress.

01:21.878 --> 01:24.123
Are you kidding me?
He was smokin'.

01:24.298 --> 01:25.872
Dennis is a good guy, okay?

01:26.046 --> 01:26.832
Not really.

01:27.006 --> 01:28.083
So when did this happen?

01:28.258 --> 01:33.263
Well, last week was my birthday,
and everyone forgot except Dennis.

01:33.426 --> 01:36.222
And he called, and we went out,
and it wasn't too weird.

01:36.387 --> 01:37.220
And how is the sex?

01:37.387 --> 01:38.931
Fast and only on Saturdays.

01:39.096 --> 01:41.892
It's perfect.

02:03.877 --> 02:06.623
Did you see this?
It's horrible.

02:06.797 --> 02:08.871
They're printing
libel about me again.

02:09.047 --> 02:12.042
Libel, Liz Lemon!

02:13.347 --> 02:17.093
Oh..."Normal."
How dare they?

02:17.476 --> 02:20.341
That's what I'm saying.
That's character assassination.

02:20.515 --> 02:21.931
That's not normal!

02:22.105 --> 02:24.013
It only looks like
I'm walking out of a Starbucks

02:24.187 --> 02:28.562
when, actually, I'm doing the robot
goin' backwards into a Starbucks.

02:28.737 --> 02:30.813
And I don't even know
whose dog that is.

02:30.985 --> 02:32.772
Yes, I steal dogs.

02:32.945 --> 02:34.112
What is the problem?

02:34.275 --> 02:35.443
I can't be normal!

02:35.615 --> 02:37.401
If I'm normal,
I'm boring.

02:37.576 --> 02:39.492
If I'm boring,
I'm not a movie star.

02:39.667 --> 02:41.623
If I'm not a movie star,
then I'm poor.

02:41.785 --> 02:48.753
And poor people can't afford to pay back
the $75,000 in cash they owe Quincy Jones!

02:53.757 --> 02:59.051
Wow...Talking to that guy,
it's like looking in a mirror, huh?

02:59.225 --> 03:00.551
Well, my armpit rash is back.

03:00.727 --> 03:02.971
Oh, Jack. You're in wardrobe.

03:03.146 --> 03:05.510
The latest research is in.
Our audience doesn't like green.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.351
Oh, that's too bad.
I like green.

03:07.527 --> 03:10.020
Research doesn't lie, Jenna.
It lets us know what we're thinking--

03:10.196 --> 03:12.401
What's too boring, what's too gay,
what's too old.

03:12.566 --> 03:13.562
What's too old?

03:13.736 --> 03:14.980
That's a very good question.
How old are you?

03:15.157 --> 03:15.731
I'm 29.

03:15.908 --> 03:17.320
- What year were you born?
- 1977.

03:17.486 --> 03:18.572
- When did you graduate high school?
- '94.

03:18.748 --> 03:20.033
- When do you turn 40?
- 2017.

03:20.207 --> 03:21.323
- Junior high crush?
- Kirk Cameron.

03:21.495 --> 03:23.073
- Prom theme?
- Motownphilly, Boyz II Men.

03:23.246 --> 03:25.030
- What movie did you lose your virginity at?
- Arachnophobia.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.371
Theater or drive-in?

03:27.546 --> 03:30.120
What's a drive-in?

03:30.296 --> 03:31.712
Of course.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.171
I don't know why
I bothered to ask.

03:33.336 --> 03:37.752
I can tell just from your physical appearance
that you're obviously...

03:37.927 --> 03:40.090
29.

03:42.018 --> 03:43.342
...So these page numbers,

03:43.518 --> 03:46.141
when done correctly,
should be sequential.

03:46.318 --> 03:47.973
Oh. Oh, Josh!

03:48.146 --> 03:50.180
Liz Taylor's assistant called.

03:50.358 --> 03:52.101
They wanted the address here
to send you something.

03:52.277 --> 03:53.601
That's awesome.

03:53.776 --> 03:55.193
She must have seen
my impression of her.

03:55.366 --> 03:57.112
Sounds like someone
loves Liz Taylor.

03:57.276 --> 03:57.773
I do.

03:57.946 --> 04:00.400
No, we mean love love.

04:00.576 --> 04:04.531
Yeah, like if she walked in right now
and said she wanted to do it with you, you would.

04:04.705 --> 04:06.121
I definitely would.

04:06.288 --> 04:06.913
What?

04:07.088 --> 04:07.581
Liz.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.791
(Josh) No, I'm totally serious.
I mean, wouldn't you guys?

04:09.955 --> 04:12.542
Jack asked me how old I am.

04:12.717 --> 04:13.423
What did you say?

04:13.587 --> 04:16.291
29. [laughs] 

04:16.798 --> 04:17.541
Ahem.

04:17.718 --> 04:18.880
Jenna, relax.

04:19.057 --> 04:23.183
I cannot and will not relax, Liz.
I am an actress.

04:23.348 --> 04:27.392
And when someone asks an actress
how old she is, it's more statement than question.

04:27.557 --> 04:31.181
When my mom's feeling old,
she goes to this guy on 71st Street.

04:31.355 --> 04:35.103
But she's old.
She's like 38.

04:35.605 --> 04:38.690
I'm gonna be sick.

04:41.576 --> 04:45.243
* Betcha he reads, betcha she sews *

04:45.417 --> 04:47.201
* Betcha they've made me

04:47.378 --> 04:48.281
*  A closet

04:48.457 --> 04:51.371
* Of clothes *

04:52.877 --> 04:56.253
Lemon, what tragedy happened in your life
that you insist upon punishing yourself

04:56.506 --> 04:59.840
with all this...
mediocrity?

05:00.008 --> 05:01.342
What? 'Cause I'm eating a turkey sub?

05:01.516 --> 05:03.092
Your turkey sub,
your clothes,

05:03.266 --> 05:08.143
the fact that a woman of your resources and position
lives like some boxcar hobo.

05:08.305 --> 05:09.892
Or maybe it's the fact
that while I'm saying all this,

05:10.065 --> 05:14.893
you have a piece of
lettuce stuck in your hair.

05:16.526 --> 05:20.862
This is the unlisted number..
of Stone,

05:21.446 --> 05:25.452
the most exclusive restaurant
in the city, currently.

05:25.617 --> 05:30.371
I think it's time that you start
enjoying some of the finer things in life.

05:30.536 --> 05:32.580
Completely unsolicited
and inappropriate.

05:32.746 --> 05:35.660
I will only accept it
because I love food.

05:35.837 --> 05:40.171
Do you know why Jack Welch
is the greatest leader since the pharaohs?

05:40.348 --> 05:46.133
Because he didn't only involve himself
in our work lives,
but our personal lives as well.

05:46.305 --> 05:49.893
He introduced us to the finest booze,
the most restrictive country clubs.

05:50.058 --> 05:54.352
He gave us the names
of the most discreet private investigators
to spy on our ex-wives.

05:54.527 --> 05:59.810
He held our hands during our triumphs
and our Senate hearings.

05:59.987 --> 06:02.363
I want to hold your hand, Lemon.

06:02.525 --> 06:03.613
Yikes.

06:03.786 --> 06:04.692
This is a perfect example.

06:04.867 --> 06:08.363
You have a million-dollar view,
yet you refuse to acknowledge

06:08.538 --> 06:10.870
that there's a whole world out there.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.371
Oh, my.

06:12.538 --> 06:16.540
There appears to be a gentleman
making passionate, angry, love to himself.

06:16.718 --> 06:17.410
Yeah, I know.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.330
That's why I closed the blinds
in the first place.

06:19.506 --> 06:21.213
Right in his office.

06:21.388 --> 06:23.553
Huh.

06:23.716 --> 06:27.880
Lemon, I like to think of myself as a winner.
I like to surround myself with winners.

06:28.056 --> 06:29.053
I see potential in you.

06:29.226 --> 06:31.802
Let me be...
your Jack Welch.

06:31.978 --> 06:34.681
Let me be your mentor.

06:34.855 --> 06:36.520
No, thank you.

06:36.687 --> 06:38.060
That is unfortunate.

06:38.238 --> 06:39.692
You've,  uh...

06:39.855 --> 06:43.153
got to admire his persistence
and stamina, though.

06:43.325 --> 06:46.400
Am I wrong,
or is he in the middle
of a staff meeting?

06:46.570 --> 06:48.785
Maybe you should be his mentor.

06:48.955 --> 06:54.549
Obviously, he doesn't need one.
He's got it all figured out.

06:58.838 --> 07:00.048
I got one for ya.

07:00.219 --> 07:02.792
See the old guy over there
with the girl?

07:02.965 --> 07:04.421
Mistress or daughter?

07:04.597 --> 07:06.003
Oh, my God,
I hope it's his daughter.

07:06.176 --> 07:08.092
Yeah, me too.

07:08.267 --> 07:10.763
Oh, my God!
Oh!

07:10.936 --> 07:12.050
God, I hope it's his mistress.

07:12.227 --> 07:13.930
Oh, that is just wrong.

07:14.106 --> 07:16.972
Hey, 007, how about some
more rolls over here, huh?

07:17.145 --> 07:20.062
Oh, my, my, what a pleasant
surprise-- Lemon.

07:20.238 --> 07:22.480
And you brought a man.
Jack Donaghy.

07:22.655 --> 07:24.061
And this is my friend Anastasia.

07:24.238 --> 07:24.690
How are you?

07:24.867 --> 07:27.402
Hi. Dennis Duffy,
Beeper King.

07:27.577 --> 07:28.993
The Beeper King,
really?

07:29.157 --> 07:31.913
Uh, Dennis has his own business.
Yes, he's an entrepreneur.

07:32.078 --> 07:32.992
He's very successful.

07:33.168 --> 07:35.453
You've probably seen my ads
on the 7 train, right?

07:35.626 --> 07:38.160
I didn't know they served
chicken nuggets at this restaurant.

07:38.337 --> 07:40.791
It's cod. It's, uh--
They made it special.

07:40.968 --> 07:42.502
Dennis has some dietary restrictions.

07:42.675 --> 07:46.461
Actually, I'm allergic to all fish
unless it's fried.

07:46.638 --> 07:47.210
You know?

07:47.387 --> 07:48.843
That's a sharp tie
you've got there, Dennis.

07:49.015 --> 07:50.553
That douche bag up
front made me wear it.

07:50.726 --> 07:51.841
Does he know you're
the Beeper King?

07:52.018 --> 07:53.013
I don't think so.

07:53.187 --> 07:54.513
Anyway, thanks for the hook-up.

07:54.686 --> 07:57.103
This is clearly the nicest restaurant
we've ever been to.

07:57.266 --> 07:57.680
Hold on a second.

07:57.858 --> 07:59.270
This place ain't that nice, all right?

07:59.435 --> 08:01.690
It's got rats and roaches
like every other restaurant.

08:01.857 --> 08:03.103
No rat talk tonight, okay?

08:03.275 --> 08:05.613
You know there are 17 rats
per person in Manhattan?

08:05.776 --> 08:08.730
You eat a pound of rat crap
every year without even knowing it, huh?

08:08.907 --> 08:10.191
I think I read about that
in The New Yorker.

08:10.368 --> 08:11.702
Anyway, we'll leave you
to your meal.

08:11.868 --> 08:16.910
I hope you enjoy the,
uh, choices that you've made.

08:22.968 --> 08:25.421
Stop it.

08:27.715 --> 08:32.552
And that former call girl went on
to become one of NBC's biggest news anchors.

08:32.726 --> 08:35.049
Star coming!
Wall hug, everybody.

08:35.227 --> 08:37.263
[gasp] That's Tracy Jordan.

08:37.434 --> 08:42.059
He seems like such a nice,
normal young man.

08:42.315 --> 08:44.981
[screaming] No!

08:45.156 --> 08:49.863
Let's keep going, you guys.
Let's keep goin'.

09:01.416 --> 09:05.580
I enjoyed the restaurant.
Thank you.

09:06.467 --> 09:07.212
Just say it.

09:07.387 --> 09:12.972
Just say what you're dying to say.
Dennis is nice to me, okay?

09:13.135 --> 09:14.421
He fixed my toilet.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.553
He broke it first,
but he fixed it.

09:16.725 --> 09:20.060
And he loves hockey,
and I'm...figuring it out.

09:20.226 --> 09:23.310
And it's easy--
I get a lot of work done.

09:23.488 --> 09:25.023
I don't have time
for a personal life, okay?

09:25.198 --> 09:29.112
I can't just go to Central Park
and join the singles touch football league.

09:29.278 --> 09:30.772
Like I'd want to anyway.

09:30.947 --> 09:33.691
People in those posters,
always laughing in their sweaters.

09:33.867 --> 09:36.613
Who are they foolin'?

09:36.787 --> 09:40.783
Oh, okay, you're not going to say anything to me
because I rejected you as a mentor?

09:40.957 --> 09:41.413
Who cares?

09:41.585 --> 09:45.621
I have a lot of friends
I can talk to about my life.

09:45.795 --> 09:49.210
The bottom line is,
Dennis is my boyfriend
because he inquired.

09:49.387 --> 09:53.762
He was the only applicant,
and I am not--

09:53.927 --> 09:56.633
Doin' great.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.102
Come in.

10:00.268 --> 10:01.100
Do you have a minute?

10:01.268 --> 10:02.642
I gotta talk to you about
this whole Dennis thing--

10:02.817 --> 10:04.983
Ah!  What did you do to yourself?

10:05.146 --> 10:07.192
Me?
Nothing.

10:07.355 --> 10:09.983
Just getting more rest,
drinking more water.

10:10.158 --> 10:13.823
Really? This water-- does someone boil it first,
then throw it in your face?

10:13.988 --> 10:20.320
Okay, I had a little Botox and some collagen,
and a chemical peel, and something with shark DNA.

10:20.497 --> 10:23.123
Admit it,
I look ten years younger.

10:23.296 --> 10:26.042
No, younger even.
You look like a fetus.

10:26.217 --> 10:28.832
Look, I came here to talk to you
about my problems with Dennis.

10:29.008 --> 10:31.002
Oh, I can't right now, honey.

10:31.176 --> 10:34.800
If I don't do my facial exercises,
I could wind up looking weird.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.843
I just mentioned Dennis,
and your eyebrows didn't go up.

10:38.018 --> 10:39.011
They didn't?

10:39.185 --> 10:40.511
No.

10:40.687 --> 10:42.013
How about now?

10:42.187 --> 10:43.813
Unh-uh.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.521
Anything?

10:47.358 --> 10:49.101
Hey, what's up, baby?
Liz around?

10:49.277 --> 10:51.523
She should be back soon.
Is that a present for her?

10:51.696 --> 10:54.533
Yeah. If she doesn't get back here soon,
I'm pokin' air holes in it.

10:54.695 --> 10:55.653
Excuse me.

10:55.828 --> 10:59.533
I couldn't help but notice that, uh...
none of you are wearing beepers.

10:59.706 --> 11:00.912
You sell beepers?

11:01.078 --> 11:02.910
I sell a way of life,
my friend.

11:03.085 --> 11:05.873
Cool. I can use some ironic accessories.

11:06.047 --> 11:06.791
What are you doing here?

11:06.956 --> 11:08.211
Hey, I bought you a present.

11:08.377 --> 11:09.581
Oh?

11:09.756 --> 11:12.130
Uh-oh.

11:12.335 --> 11:13.713
Oh, no. It got out.

11:13.888 --> 11:15.633
If anyone sees a salamander,
it's Liz's.

11:15.805 --> 11:18.720
No. I don't want a salamander!
And I don't want you here selling beepers.

11:18.887 --> 11:21.263
Why not? I mean, you work in a business.
Business people need beepers.

11:21.437 --> 11:22.643
No, they need cell phones.

11:22.806 --> 11:25.180
Oh, yeah, for now.
But the beeper's gonna be making a comeback.

11:25.357 --> 11:26.350
Technology's cyclical.

11:26.528 --> 11:28.351
No technology is not cyclical.

11:28.527 --> 11:31.853
(Jack) I thought I recognized that voice.
Dennis, how the heck are you?

11:32.026 --> 11:32.772
Did you enjoy that restaurant?

11:32.947 --> 11:34.151
Nah, I think I was right 
about that place.

11:34.315 --> 11:35.943
We actually saw a whole nest of rats
when we were leaving.

11:36.118 --> 11:37.191
No, we didn't.

11:37.368 --> 11:39.401
I just didn't want to tell you
'cause I knew you'd freak out.

11:39.575 --> 11:40.823
Actually, I think I saw a rat king.

11:40.998 --> 11:42.363
Aren't rat kings a myth?

11:42.536 --> 11:43.700
What's a rat king?

11:43.875 --> 11:47.162
Oh, it's when a bunch of rats
are crammed into a tiny space,

11:47.337 --> 11:50.160
and their tails get all tangled up,
and they can't even pull apart.

11:50.338 --> 11:51.210
And  then it gets awesome.

11:51.376 --> 11:55.170
Eventually, their bodies fuse together
and they form a multi-headed live rat king.

11:55.347 --> 11:56.751
And we saw one.

11:56.928 --> 11:59.511
Gosh, I hope you got a picture of that
with the camera on your beeper.

11:59.706 --> 12:02.802
Actually, my beeper doesn't have a camera,
but it does have a pedometer.

12:02.975 --> 12:04.972
Actually, not this one.

12:05.146 --> 12:07.850
[whispering] I love him.

12:08.025 --> 12:09.983
Listen, I need to talk to you
in my office, please.

12:10.148 --> 12:10.773
- Why?
- Now.

12:10.938 --> 12:13.272
What's up?

12:13.447 --> 12:14.313
Is that a tattoo?

12:14.486 --> 12:15.812
Uh-huh. [chuckles]

12:15.988 --> 12:17.982
Who normal now?
You hear me, America?

12:18.155 --> 12:21.153
Who's normal now?

12:23.498 --> 12:25.203
How could you do this
to the show?

12:25.378 --> 12:27.782
I got this tattoo
for the good of the show.

12:27.955 --> 12:30.452
It gives us an edge--
the reason why you brought me on.

12:30.625 --> 12:33.291
And when you purchase Tracy Jordan,
he comes with a tattoo

12:33.468 --> 12:35.503
of a biblical dragon
from outer space.

12:35.676 --> 12:37.210
It's gonna take forever
to cover this thing with makeup.

12:37.385 --> 12:39.711
You can't put makeup
on my tattoo, Liz Lemon.

12:39.887 --> 12:42.342
It's in my contract.

12:42.517 --> 12:43.681
No, it's not.

12:43.845 --> 12:46.393
Actually, he's got a pretty weird contract.

12:46.556 --> 12:50.182
Great. Jenna looks like
a porn star burn victim,
and now this idiot.

12:50.357 --> 12:52.183
What am I gonna do?

12:52.358 --> 12:54.852
It's gonna be Josh's busiest show ever.

12:55.028 --> 12:57.401
Oof...

13:00.578 --> 13:02.862
Josh?

13:04.577 --> 13:06.533
Miss Taylor.

13:06.706 --> 13:08.782
When your office said you were
sending me something,

13:08.955 --> 13:11.163
I didn't realize
it would be you.

13:11.335 --> 13:16.213
But I had to give you this gift
in person, Josh.

13:16.927 --> 13:18.093
Oh.

13:18.257 --> 13:20.713
I'm just glad you weren't
offended by my impression.

13:20.888 --> 13:22.010
Oh...

13:22.175 --> 13:23.630
but I was...

13:23.808 --> 13:24.971
deeply.

13:25.137 --> 13:28.723
I'm here to give you the gift...
of pain.

13:28.896 --> 13:30.972
The gift of what?

13:31.145 --> 13:32.810
White diamonds!

13:32.987 --> 13:35.353
Ha ha!

13:37.816 --> 13:39.273
Okay, very funny.

13:39.445 --> 13:42.233
You bought a pager from Dennis.
Will you take it off now, please?

13:42.407 --> 13:45.613
Oh, I can't.
I'm expecting a call from 1983.

13:45.788 --> 13:47.412
Look, Dennis takes care of me, okay?

13:47.576 --> 13:49.742
Liz, I'd like you
to meet Howard Jorgensen.

13:49.917 --> 13:50.493
Liz, how do you do?

13:50.666 --> 13:53.790
He's the vice president of locomotives,
and a rising star at GE.

13:53.955 --> 13:56.331
I thought the two of you
had a lot in common.

13:56.506 --> 13:58.670
You are relentless.

13:58.835 --> 14:02.960
Look, uh, Howard, you're obviously
an attractive and confident guy,

14:03.135 --> 14:06.261
and at a different time in my life,
I could definitely see the two of us together.

14:06.436 --> 14:11.222
I'm married with two
beautiful kids and a pool.

14:11.395 --> 14:12.561
(Jack) Liz, I wasn't
trying to set you up.

14:12.725 --> 14:14.273
I wanted to show you my handiwork.

14:14.436 --> 14:16.351
I used to mentor Howard.

14:16.527 --> 14:18.060
(Howard) I was a lot like you.

14:18.237 --> 14:21.771
I dressed poorly,
had bad posture,

14:21.948 --> 14:23.151
walked around
with lettuce in my hair.

14:23.326 --> 14:24.402
Oh, son of a bitch.

14:24.576 --> 14:26.611
And I cursed like a sailor.

14:26.786 --> 14:29.822
But Jack saw potential in me.
He changed my life.

14:29.996 --> 14:33.543
Now Howard's earning seven figures
and he's married to a swell Filipino gal.

14:33.707 --> 14:34.243
[chuckles] Oh, thanks, Jack.

14:34.417 --> 14:38.790
Look, I told you,
I don't need a mentor.

14:39.217 --> 14:41.500
Fine.

14:42.846 --> 14:45.300
Liz Taylor really messed him up.
He might have brain damage.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.170
(Liz on phone) Oh, my God.

14:47.345 --> 14:49.801
Maybe the musical guest
can do some extra songs this week.

14:49.978 --> 14:50.591
Who is it?

14:50.768 --> 14:51.893
James Blunt.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.600
Oh.

14:53.766 --> 14:55.680
No, I said no lettuce.

14:55.855 --> 14:57.813
Are you at that crappy
sandwich place again?

14:57.988 --> 15:00.650
Yeah-- why is everybody
judging all of my choices lately?

15:00.815 --> 15:02.771
This place is fine--

15:02.946 --> 15:05.482
It's convenient, it's consistent,
I know what I'm getting,

15:05.657 --> 15:07.820
it doesn't make me
feel bad about my body.

15:07.995 --> 15:08.491
And you know what?

15:08.657 --> 15:10.991
Maybe I'm at an age where it's okay
for me to settle for this.

15:11.168 --> 15:15.872
Are we still talking
about the sandwich place?

15:16.046 --> 15:19.000
No, sadly,
I don't think we are.

15:19.167 --> 15:21.583
Okay.
I admit it.

15:21.756 --> 15:24.962
Dennis isn't a sandwich I want to eat
every day for the rest of my life.

15:25.135 --> 15:26.211
I'm clueless about men.

15:26.387 --> 15:28.631
I'm clueless about everything
that isn't this show.

15:28.806 --> 15:29.932
Maybe you can tell me how to live,

15:30.095 --> 15:32.011
because sadly,
you may be the most stable person

15:32.186 --> 15:35.182
I know right now.

15:35.476 --> 15:38.022
Gentlemen, we'll have to continue
this conference some other time.

15:38.188 --> 15:39.602
(Howard on speakerphone)
That's her again, isn't it?

15:39.777 --> 15:41.520
Hi, Howard. (hangs up phone)

15:41.696 --> 15:43.442
Lemon, today is the first day
of the rest of your life,

15:43.615 --> 15:45.612
and what is the first thing
you need to do?

15:45.778 --> 15:47.190
I have to break up with Dennis.

15:47.367 --> 15:48.071
And why is that?

15:48.247 --> 15:51.820
Because he wears shirts
with the Looney Tunes embroidered on them.

15:51.995 --> 15:53.623
Because he cuts his own hair.

15:53.787 --> 15:56.580
Because that one little nice thing that he does,
doesn't make up for the fact

15:56.747 --> 15:58.870
that I don't want to
be seen with him in public.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.253
And if you don't break up
with him now?

16:00.415 --> 16:02.542
He'll just keep showing up
at work to sell beepers.

16:02.717 --> 16:05.423
He'll just keep calling
my mother to borrow money.

16:05.596 --> 16:08.212
We'll just get more and more
tangled up in each other's lives

16:08.386 --> 16:12.970
until I just can't even get away
and we're just like--
Oh, my God.

16:13.145 --> 16:16.261
That's right.
He's the rat king.

16:16.435 --> 16:18.181
And there's only one way
to break up with a rat.

16:18.355 --> 16:19.471
You have to cut him
off completely.

16:19.648 --> 16:20.103
I know.

16:20.276 --> 16:23.600
You have to stuff your heart
with steel wool and tinfoil.

16:23.778 --> 16:26.732
You must be ruthless.
You must to be absolute.

16:26.906 --> 16:28.440
Remember always,
you are The Exterminator.

16:28.616 --> 16:29.073
Say it.

16:29.235 --> 16:30.033
I am The Exterminator.

16:30.195 --> 16:30.943
Say it like you mean it.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.400
- I am The Exterminator!
- Louder!

16:32.578 --> 16:34.360
[shouting] I am The Exterminator!

16:34.536 --> 16:35.820
Okay, not that loud.

16:35.996 --> 16:38.242
[whispering] People are trying to work
around here, okay?

16:38.416 --> 16:41.003
(woman on P.A.) 30 minutes to dress rehearsal.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.501
Tracy, they need you in wardrobe. 

16:42.668 --> 16:47.500
(woman) That's 30 minutes
till dress rehearsal.

16:48.308 --> 16:51.590
Why is part of your face
still on the pillow?

16:51.765 --> 16:53.593
Damn it. Where's my Sharpie?

16:53.768 --> 16:55.760
Oh, it is fake!

16:55.936 --> 16:57.603
Look, I'm crazy,
not stupid.

16:57.765 --> 17:00.063
A movie star can't have
a big old permanent face tattoo.

17:00.225 --> 17:02.233
I just need to walk around
with this for a week,

17:02.395 --> 17:05.603
get  my picture on the interweb,
show the world I'm still dangerous.

17:05.777 --> 17:07.770
And then what about next week
when you don't have it anymore?

17:07.944 --> 17:08.981
You're gonna look like--

17:09.156 --> 17:11.491
I had extreme plastic surgery
to have it removed.

17:11.656 --> 17:12.862
Ba-boom!

17:13.105 --> 17:15.109
That's another "Not Normal."

17:15.286 --> 17:19.161
You know this is very, very,
very bad for me, right?

17:19.335 --> 17:21.200
I need to protect my reputation.

17:21.376 --> 17:24.750
You take away my street cred,
and I am Wayne Brady.

17:24.925 --> 17:25.372
Nuh-uh.

17:25.548 --> 17:26.790
Wayne Brady has three Emmys.

17:26.965 --> 17:32.260
You have a People's Choice Award
that you stole from Wayne Brady.

17:32.428 --> 17:38.681
I shouldn't expect a white woman from Whiteville
to understand street cred.

17:38.857 --> 17:40.351
First of all,
I'm not from Whiteville.

17:40.515 --> 17:45.892
I'm from White Haven,
and it's not as nice as it sounds.

17:46.106 --> 17:47.442
Oh...fine!

17:47.605 --> 17:52.231
You can keep the tattoo.
For this week only.

17:54.367 --> 17:55.450
(man) Okay, here we go.

17:55.618 --> 17:56.913
Quiet, please!

17:57.076 --> 17:59.160
Rehearsing!

17:59.325 --> 18:02.911
(male announcer) And now, a word
from the White House.

18:03.086 --> 18:05.290
Good evening.
I'm Laura Bush.

18:05.466 --> 18:07.543
And I'm Condoleezza Rice.

18:07.718 --> 18:10.841
[indistinctly] And I'm John Kerry.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.303
Well, we had a good run.

18:12.466 --> 18:13.760
What the hell happened here?

18:13.926 --> 18:16.012
The cast had a rough week.

18:16.187 --> 18:19.222
These people cannot be on television.

18:19.395 --> 18:22.721
What is your contingency plan
for a crapstorm of this magnitude?

18:22.895 --> 18:23.771
There is none.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.482
We go live in a half an hour.

18:25.645 --> 18:28.693
No wonder your career is being held back
by a lack of foresight

18:28.858 --> 18:31.151
and an addiction
to dysfunctional relationships.

18:31.325 --> 18:34.991
You have no exit strategies.

18:36.158 --> 18:37.280
He knows about my marriage?

18:37.457 --> 18:39.112
No.

18:39.286 --> 18:40.662
This is gonna be a bad show.

18:40.828 --> 18:43.041
Worse than the time we let Tracy
do that tribute to August Wilson?

18:43.205 --> 18:44.241
That was my fault.

18:44.418 --> 18:46.372
I should have made sure he knew
who August Wilson was.

18:46.548 --> 18:48.962
Maybe we'll be pre-empted
by some national news event.

18:49.125 --> 18:52.631
How's Gerald Ford's health?

18:52.796 --> 18:55.012
Oh, a blackout.
That'll work.

18:55.177 --> 18:56.671
(Pete) All right,
Nobody panic!

18:56.846 --> 19:02.221
The backup generator will kick in
in just a few seconds.

19:03.396 --> 19:04.851
Okay, you can panic.

19:05.026 --> 19:07.640
(Liz) This is real.

19:07.818 --> 19:09.563
We dodged a bullet here
tonight, Lemon.

19:09.737 --> 19:12.732
Yes, this blackout is
a fortunate coincidence.

19:12.908 --> 19:14.191
You didn't do it, right?

19:14.366 --> 19:15.610
What, do you think
I control the universe?

19:15.787 --> 19:19.033
Yo, this blackout messed me up.

19:19.207 --> 19:23.120
I didn't get to debut my dragon face.
Could I do the Today Show tomorrow?

19:23.285 --> 19:24.953
No, you're on a plane
to Boston tomorrow, Tray.

19:25.126 --> 19:25.743
We have a laboratory.

19:25.916 --> 19:27.621
They're experimenting
in tattoo removal.

19:27.795 --> 19:32.132
It promises to be one of our biggest profit centers
once today's generation finally sobers up.

19:32.297 --> 19:33.840
Tattoo's fake, Donaghy.

19:34.008 --> 19:36.301
Fake.

19:36.968 --> 19:39.590
Street cred.
He's a genius.

19:39.765 --> 19:40.880
(man) Flashlight, $20!

19:41.056 --> 19:43.221
Flashlight, $20!

19:43.395 --> 19:45.223
- Can I give you a ride?
- Flashlight, $20!

19:45.396 --> 19:48.021
No. I wouldn't want to crowd you.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.641
Be strong, Lemon.

19:49.818 --> 19:53.061
Don't let Dennis chew
his way out of this one.

19:53.238 --> 19:54.112
(man) Flashlight, $20!

19:54.276 --> 19:55.520
Can I borrow 20 bucks?

19:55.696 --> 19:59.030
(man) Flashlight, $20!

20:05.126 --> 20:08.081
Dennis, wake up.

20:08.455 --> 20:09.750
Huh? What?

20:09.917 --> 20:14.001
You could've burned the place down.

20:15.215 --> 20:17.802
I wish I had burned the place down.

20:17.966 --> 20:20.470
There's no reason to live anymore.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.220
What happened?

20:22.386 --> 20:25.302
The Islanders lost tonight.

20:25.478 --> 20:28.930
Doesn't that happen a lot?

20:29.106 --> 20:32.983
I knew you wouldn't understand.

20:49.456 --> 20:50.662
So how did it go?

20:50.837 --> 20:52.461
He moved in with me.

20:52.627 --> 20:56.003
Well, of course he did.

20:57.305 --> 21:03.566
