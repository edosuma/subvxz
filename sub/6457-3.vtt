The pain's gone higher up.

00:40.240 --> 00:43.120
Oh, dear. Oh,
nothing for me, then?

00:43.280 --> 00:45.680
No, I haven't been
for three days now.

00:45.840 --> 00:48.240
I'm like that after
a pickled egg.

00:48.400 --> 00:51.400
Do you think I've got
a blockage, nurse?

00:51.560 --> 00:53.640
Nah, it's probably
just the hospital food.

00:53.800 --> 00:55.560
How are you
getting on with that?

00:55.720 --> 00:57.280
Oh, you've got a couple left.

00:57.440 --> 01:00.080
Do you have anything
for, uh, for 15 down?

01:00.240 --> 01:03.200
It's, uh, "swollen",
eight letters.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.720
Ends with d.

01:04.880 --> 01:06.176
I'll have to get
back to you on that.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.920
I'll see if I can get a sister

01:08.080 --> 01:10.176
to talk to dr Moore to write
you up for some laxatives, okay?

01:10.200 --> 01:11.920
- I hope that's all it needs.
- Mmm.

01:12.080 --> 01:13.600
Thanks, nurse.

01:14.160 --> 01:15.640
Oh!

01:15.800 --> 01:17.160
Is it "engorged"?

01:19.240 --> 01:21.800
I don't know,
but it's very itchy.

01:21.960 --> 01:23.400
Thanks, all, for coming.

01:23.560 --> 01:25.240
So, what we're
talking about today is,

01:25.400 --> 01:28.720
I'm here to cascade down to
the ward staff the new priorities.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.440
Kim: Sorry, I'm late.

01:30.600 --> 01:33.320
Could we all revisit your
time-management strategies?

01:33.480 --> 01:36.840
Um, because we all know that punctuality
is the number one stress-buster.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.960
I had to clear up some wee.
That was cascading down.

01:42.120 --> 01:45.960
So, what we're looking at today
is environmental performance,

01:46.120 --> 01:49.520
carbon reduction and
environmental impacts.

01:49.680 --> 01:51.320
We do this in a number of ways.

01:51.480 --> 01:55.520
Energy, waste, water,
recycling and bikes.

01:56.400 --> 01:57.880
Now, when we're all at home,

01:58.040 --> 02:00.400
I know that every single
one of us does our compost

02:00.560 --> 02:03.000
and our recycling and we
use low-energy light bulbs,

02:03.160 --> 02:05.441
- but, you know, just because we're at work...
- [Mouthing]

02:05.480 --> 02:07.240
doesn't mean that
we shouldn't go around

02:07.400 --> 02:08.920
not switching off the lights,

02:09.080 --> 02:10.560
or letting the water run, or...

02:10.720 --> 02:12.416
Hilary: Can... can I stop you there, please?
- Yes.

02:12.440 --> 02:13.840
You've missed something out.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.520
Your target is to reduce the
carbon footprint of the hospital

02:17.680 --> 02:19.880
by 35% within three years.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.200
Thank you, mr loftus,
that is correct. So...

02:24.360 --> 02:26.480
I was one of the
original designers

02:26.640 --> 02:31.440
in the reorganisation colour-coding
mandates for waste disposal.

02:31.600 --> 02:32.360
Right.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.880
Well, would... Would you like to

02:34.040 --> 02:35.960
come and outline the
targets then, mr loftus?

02:36.120 --> 02:39.520
I don't think that would be
appropriate, so carry on, please.

02:39.680 --> 02:42.880
Can I ask what training you're
providing for staff on all of this?

02:43.040 --> 02:44.880
This is the training session.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.040
Oh, I thought you said
you were cascading.

02:47.200 --> 02:48.200
It's cascade training.

02:48.320 --> 02:50.360
Oh, two for the
price of one, is it?

02:50.520 --> 02:52.440
It's more efficient
that way, I guess.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.400
So, um, outside of every ward,

02:54.560 --> 02:56.056
we're going to have
an electricity metre...

02:56.080 --> 02:59.480
And we will be recording,
in ohms and wattage.

02:59.640 --> 03:01.640
Kim: As opposed to
Holmes and Watson.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.240
[All chuckling]

03:05.160 --> 03:06.720
Very good.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.480
Uh, but getting
back to the point,

03:08.640 --> 03:12.080
for each ward there will
be rewards and penalties.

03:12.240 --> 03:16.760
And will there be overtime payments
to allow for assimilation of all this?

03:16.920 --> 03:18.520
Kim: Yeah, that'd be nice.

03:18.680 --> 03:20.976
- Yeah, what do we win?
- Damaris: Well, it's... it's not...

03:21.000 --> 03:23.800
- Is there a trip to Blackpool illuminations?
- [Woman laughs]

03:23.960 --> 03:25.440
Or maybe that's the punishment.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.320
Um, all of the dirty and
clean sluices have been fitted

03:28.480 --> 03:30.520
with motion-sensor-activated
lighting,

03:30.680 --> 03:32.096
which'll give us all
a great head start.

03:32.120 --> 03:33.640
How much does
that cost, I wonder.

03:33.800 --> 03:36.800
So, I'm now going to hand
out the training booklets.

03:36.960 --> 03:39.080
- Hooray.
- So we can all have a look at those.

03:39.240 --> 03:41.560
- Can't wait.
- They're called stop using it, you loser.

03:41.720 --> 03:45.840
You haven't briefed the staff
about the waste identification system.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.016
Damaris: Oh, actually, I
wanted to check a few facts

03:48.040 --> 03:49.760
before I cascaded that down.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.520
I'm... I'm a bit
confused about...

03:51.680 --> 03:53.600
Hilary: Look, it's
very, very simple.

03:53.760 --> 03:57.480
It's the tiger stripes and the
Bumblebee thing. I'm a little...

03:57.640 --> 03:59.536
- Shall I pass it along?
- Yes, please. Thank you, den.

03:59.560 --> 04:02.760
Um, I'll take you all
through it this once.

04:02.920 --> 04:08.280
Okay, you are going to be
using yellow for infectious/clinical.

04:09.520 --> 04:12.000
Orange for household.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.960
And black and yellow,

04:14.120 --> 04:18.160
or, as what we like to call
them, Bumblebee or tiger stripes

04:18.320 --> 04:20.880
for offensive but
never infectious

04:21.040 --> 04:26.320
because it costs actually £100 per
tonne more expensive to dispose of.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.656
I'm sorry, but how are we supposed
to be able to tell the difference

04:28.680 --> 04:29.960
between those two yellows?

04:30.120 --> 04:31.720
The plain yellow
is just informational,

04:33.400 --> 04:37.520
and the black stripe is...
Is clearly a Bumblebee.

04:37.680 --> 04:41.760
It's about observing
and looking for this,

04:41.920 --> 04:43.520
looking for this black stripe.

04:43.680 --> 04:47.840
Perhaps we could have some time
at the end to get to know the bags.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.400
You will check my return to
study essay title, won't you?

04:51.560 --> 04:54.120
I will. I'm just feeling
queasy, that's all.

04:54.280 --> 04:57.080
I think this is the week that the
mucous plug forms in the cervix.

04:57.240 --> 04:58.896
Do you think that can
give you indigestion?

04:58.920 --> 05:00.440
You said you'd be my mentor.

05:00.600 --> 05:01.880
Yeah, I will,
Kim. It's just that

05:02.000 --> 05:04.800
I don't want to vomit all
over your paperwork, do I?

05:04.960 --> 05:06.760
Oi, den.

05:06.920 --> 05:09.600
Dave's got a mate that can
make these things go backwards.

05:09.760 --> 05:11.320
We haven't paid a
lecky bill in years.

05:11.480 --> 05:12.760
That's dishonest, Kim.

05:12.920 --> 05:14.296
Kim: Yeah, but
you're an accomplice.

05:14.320 --> 05:16.240
What about your
2,000-watt turbo hair dryer?

05:16.400 --> 05:18.640
Nearly took the
roof off this morning.

05:18.800 --> 05:20.160
[Phone rings]

05:20.320 --> 05:21.640
Ward k2.

05:21.800 --> 05:25.040
No, we don't do any
bariatrics or gastric.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.760
Okay, well, what's the name?

05:27.920 --> 05:32.360
Steve? No, sorry, we don't
do men here, either. No.

05:32.520 --> 05:36.520
[Sighs] Well, if he's pre-op, why
can't he just go home for the weekend?

05:36.680 --> 05:38.640
Yeah, I suppose.
Yeah, care and repair.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.736
They've got to put the
window back in, haven't they?

05:40.760 --> 05:43.960
He's going to be a bit heavy.
That's the only problem for us.

05:45.360 --> 05:47.480
No, on the electricity, I mean.

05:47.640 --> 05:50.320
Oh, I can block
out the whole ward?

05:50.480 --> 05:52.040
Yeah. No, that
will be brilliant.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.520
Thanks. That's a deal. Cheers.

05:55.600 --> 05:56.760
- Kim?
- Kim: Yeah.

05:56.920 --> 05:59.440
Um, can you phone
down to porterage, please?

05:59.600 --> 06:01.920
I just need that floor clear.

06:02.080 --> 06:03.080
Are we having a disco?

06:03.240 --> 06:04.656
Pippa: Morning,
sister. Morning, gents.

06:04.680 --> 06:06.640
- [Mobile rings]
- Oh, sorry. Excuse me.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.000
I'm just going to take this.
Uh, good morning, Jennifer.

06:10.880 --> 06:15.520
Right, right. So, that's what
he's stated on his form e, is it?

06:15.680 --> 06:17.600
No, no. Right. Well,
no, he always told me

06:17.760 --> 06:21.640
that he put 33.3% of his net
salary into a savings account.

06:23.080 --> 06:25.200
£4,000 on a Gordon
ramsay picnic?

06:25.360 --> 06:26.976
No, he's... he's making
all of this up, Jen.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.160
He's probably put it in some
offshore bank account or something.

06:32.040 --> 06:33.840
No, I didn't know that.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.640
Sorry, half of my pension?

06:35.800 --> 06:38.600
No, he bloody... He
bloody well can't, can he?

06:38.760 --> 06:40.480
So, no, no, no.

06:40.640 --> 06:42.936
Why should I lose out because
he has squandered all that money?

06:42.960 --> 06:44.840
No, this is grossly unfair!

06:46.480 --> 06:48.360
Okay, yes, I will. I'll
speak to you later.

06:48.520 --> 06:49.960
All right, thank you.

06:50.120 --> 06:51.280
Little prick.

06:54.320 --> 06:56.800
Pippa: Good morning,
mrs dethick. Hello again.

06:56.960 --> 07:00.520
Oh, hello, dr Moore. I'm so
sorry to be such a nuisance to you.

07:00.680 --> 07:03.120
Oh, not a bit of it! That's
what we're here for.

07:03.280 --> 07:04.560
You're no trouble at all.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.200
Um, what are her latest obs?

07:06.360 --> 07:08.160
I guess, all normal range.

07:08.320 --> 07:11.240
Right, so gents, differential
diagnosis. What do we need to rule out?

07:11.400 --> 07:12.600
Female intern: Ovarian cancer.

07:12.760 --> 07:14.456
Pippa: Yes, we've done
a ca-125 tumour marker.

07:14.480 --> 07:15.800
Do you remember? What else?

07:15.960 --> 07:17.496
- Female intern 2: Pancreatitis?
- Pippa: Yes.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.480
- Pippa: So, how do we test for that?
- Uh, ct-kub.

07:19.560 --> 07:20.720
Pippa: Yes, which stands for?

07:20.880 --> 07:23.120
Computer tomography,
kidney, ureter, bowels.

07:23.280 --> 07:24.960
Pippa: No. Anyone else?

07:25.120 --> 07:26.880
Female intern: Kidney, urine...

07:27.040 --> 07:29.600
-Pippa: No! Kidney, ureter and?
-Male intern: Bones?

07:29.760 --> 07:33.160
Bladder and raised
amylase levels. What else?

07:33.320 --> 07:35.080
So... so, which one have I got?

07:35.240 --> 07:36.976
- Pippa: Any thoughts at all?
- Den: Oh, um...

07:37.000 --> 07:38.896
- Den: There's probably nothing wrong at all.
- Dethick: Oh.

07:38.920 --> 07:41.080
Josh, anything at
all to contribute here?

07:43.360 --> 07:45.200
Hypochondriasis, could it be?

07:45.360 --> 07:48.440
Uh, this is just for the medical
staff training. Thank you, sister.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.760
What I'm saying is that
nobody has actually ever found

07:50.920 --> 07:53.280
anything wrong with her
with any of these tests.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.360
- And your point being?
- [Sighs]

07:55.520 --> 07:59.160
Um, maybe a spell in the loony bin
might be more appropriate. [Whispers]

07:59.320 --> 08:00.320
Right, thank you, sister.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.880
Does this need to be on?

08:02.040 --> 08:03.536
Uh, sorry, mr loftus,
if you don't mind,

08:03.560 --> 08:04.840
you are in danger of obstructing

08:04.880 --> 08:06.296
one of your precious
patients' pathways here.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.696
This lady could
be very sick indeed.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.440
Planning, patient.
Patient, planning.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.360
If it doesn't need to
be on, it needs to be off.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.736
-Okay, thank you very much. Thank you.
-Thank you. Thank you.

08:18.760 --> 08:21.560
Oh, uh, sister, by the
way, I've got Josh primed

08:21.720 --> 08:23.520
to take some photographic
images this afternoon

08:23.640 --> 08:25.160
- of suitable patients.
- Sorry, what?

08:25.320 --> 08:26.456
What? I don't know
anything about that.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.200
Well, I need to get my
consent forms signed.

08:28.320 --> 08:30.200
My vag-at research
funding is in danger

08:30.360 --> 08:31.960
because I'm in a
race against the Dutch,

08:32.120 --> 08:34.800
and I need to get these vulval
specimens photographed asap.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.920
So, um, if that's all right.

08:37.080 --> 08:40.200
-Yes, fine.
-Great, lovely. Thank you. Where to now?

08:40.360 --> 08:42.760
Um, we're going to
see mrs lorna Tully.

08:43.360 --> 08:44.640
Mrs Tully.

08:46.240 --> 08:49.840
Yeah, we only need about
five. Get... ask ms burgess.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.240
Elaine you can ask. Don't ask
Doris because she's not all there.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.880
Oh. I know. You
could ask mrs dethick,

08:54.960 --> 08:57.480
'cause she has been
ripping off the nhs for years.

08:57.640 --> 09:00.440
So, she might be willing
to give back, yeah?

09:00.600 --> 09:03.080
So, you're telling me I've
got to ask her if she's willing

09:03.240 --> 09:06.160
to have her cherry pop
photographed for medical prosperity?

09:06.320 --> 09:07.400
What is a cherry pop?

09:07.560 --> 09:09.160
Well, what did your
mum call yours?

09:09.320 --> 09:10.600
I don't know.
"Laa-laa", I think.

09:10.720 --> 09:13.880
It's better than a po or
a tinky winky, I suppose.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.240
Right, I am on my break.

09:16.400 --> 09:19.520
Yeah, just get them to sign page
three, all right? All anonymous.

09:19.680 --> 09:22.560
Cascading down to bonjour
for a hot chocolate, are you?

09:22.720 --> 09:25.480
No, I just need to, you know, get
a breath of fresh air or something.

09:25.640 --> 09:28.800
It's not just me who needs to
do this, you know. It's important.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.160
[Panting] And you. You!

09:31.320 --> 09:34.480
Just because you're employed by
cerium doesn't mean you're exempt.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.160
If you see something
on, switch it off.

09:37.320 --> 09:39.520
- Hilary: Thank you.
- Kim: Excuse me.

09:52.320 --> 09:55.000
- Oh, hello there, mr Ferris.
- Stephen: Hello.

09:57.720 --> 09:59.920
Kim: So, is this the rolls
Royce of beds, then?

10:00.080 --> 10:01.960
Stephen: Ooh, yes, indeedy.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.960
Did they send down any
bariatric inco pads with him?

10:10.120 --> 10:13.040
No, I think they're expecting
a delivery at 3:00, yeah?

10:13.200 --> 10:16.440
Den: [Gasps] Well, what's he
meant to do till then? Poor sod!

10:19.560 --> 10:22.760
Oh, den, my 2,000-word
essay title's come through.

10:22.920 --> 10:23.920
Yeah, what is it?

10:24.040 --> 10:25.920
I can't remember offhand.

10:26.080 --> 10:27.496
Oh, Kim, you're going to have
to remember a lot more than that

10:27.520 --> 10:28.600
if you want to be a doctor.

10:28.680 --> 10:31.400
Do you want to have a look?

10:31.560 --> 10:35.000
"Identify a personal knowledge
deficit related to your area of practice,

10:35.160 --> 10:37.080
"with reference to
strategies you could utilise,

10:37.240 --> 10:39.560
"e.g., study models, skill...

10:39.720 --> 10:42.360
"Study skills, models of
reflection and resources available,

10:42.520 --> 10:45.600
"and describe how you would
resolve this, and how you plan to use...

10:45.760 --> 10:49.600
"Utilise these aspects in your
future learning and development."

10:50.360 --> 10:51.880
What's that mean?

10:52.040 --> 10:54.720
Don't know. I thought you
might be able to tell me.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.280
Maybe it's just my
nappy brain. [Sighs]

11:15.680 --> 11:16.840
Oh, no, no.

11:24.280 --> 11:27.440
Pippa: Oh, sorry, can you
turn that back on, please?

11:27.600 --> 11:32.640
I have to get you to input your
validated mentorship registration number.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.640
I haven't got one
of those. Sorry.

11:35.800 --> 11:38.360
Haven't you done the course?
The mentorship course?

11:38.520 --> 11:39.976
No, I haven't... I haven't
done any mentorship course.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.936
I just thought you wanted
me to help you, that's all.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.160
I was just trying to be...

11:43.320 --> 11:45.760
Oh, great, so now I
haven't got a mentor.

11:45.920 --> 11:49.720
Sorry. Well, what about Damaris?
What about her? She's got...

11:49.880 --> 11:51.920
[Sniffles] Oh, god.

11:58.120 --> 12:01.320
Megan. Megan's got loads
and loads of qualifications.

12:01.480 --> 12:03.400
Mmm, I suppose
that's slightly better.

12:03.560 --> 12:05.080
- Oh, she owes me one, and all.
- Mmm.

12:05.240 --> 12:06.680
[Door buzzes]

12:06.840 --> 12:10.400
Oh, look. Here comes Sigmund
Freud for his morning cuppa.

12:12.880 --> 12:14.880
Nigel! Hello! Hi!

12:15.040 --> 12:16.576
-Pippa. I'm so sorry, I got your
message -so you're over here today.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.176
- About meeting for coffee.
- How are you? How is sian?

12:18.200 --> 12:19.760
I'm sorry, I haven't
had a minute.

12:19.920 --> 12:22.480
- Gosh. Oh, hello.
- Uh...

12:22.640 --> 12:24.656
- Nigel: Nice to see you again.
- Pippa: And you. Yes.

12:24.680 --> 12:26.280
- Um...
- Yes.

12:26.440 --> 12:28.416
I... I'm working with the
bariatric team on the psych side.

12:28.440 --> 12:29.840
- Right, yes.
- Uh...

12:30.000 --> 12:32.760
Some of these people can
be tipped over into depression.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.760
- Mmm, yes, awful. Awful, yes.
- Yes.

12:35.920 --> 12:38.616
And... and then of course the nhs
wouldn't fund the plastic surgery...

12:38.640 --> 12:40.240
- Mmm.
- To get rid of the resulting,

12:40.400 --> 12:42.720
- you know, extra folds of skin.
- Folds. Gosh, yes, tragic.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.560
- Tragic. Fascinating area.
- Hmm.

12:44.720 --> 12:47.720
But a bit... can be a bit of a
bed blocker, can't it? But...

12:47.880 --> 12:50.080
And incidentally, did
you know that, um,

12:50.240 --> 12:55.280
a new potato is half the calories
of... Of an ordinary potato?

12:56.320 --> 12:57.800
- No, no, I didn't.
- Yes.

13:00.720 --> 13:03.320
So, uh, well, Stephen Ferris.
Do you know where he is?

13:03.480 --> 13:07.400
Uh, yes indeed. Yes, I'm sure
sister can point you in the right...

13:07.560 --> 13:14.160
Um, sister, do you want to show dr
hoskins to the bariatric patient, please?

13:14.320 --> 13:15.880
Den: Um, yes, Kim?

13:16.040 --> 13:18.656
- Yeah? Sure.
- Can you show the gastric bypass, please, to dr hoskins?

13:18.680 --> 13:20.960
- Thank you.
- Well, uh...

13:22.440 --> 13:25.840
Uh, last week's jolly
was fun, wasn't it?

13:26.000 --> 13:29.840
Yes. Yes, glaxo certainly seem to
know their way around their vodkas.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.320
Don't they? Goodness. Yes.

13:31.480 --> 13:34.040
- Did you try the melon one?
- No. No. Melon? [Laughs]

13:34.200 --> 13:37.160
It was quite delicious but I
rather lost track after that.

13:37.320 --> 13:40.200
I've got a couple of
blank moments myself.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.800
- It's ready now.
- Yes. Thank you. Um...

13:44.880 --> 13:47.520
I do hope I wasn't...

13:47.680 --> 13:49.200
[Stutters] I... I didn't...

13:49.360 --> 13:52.520
Not a bit of it. No, no, you
were... You're charming.

13:54.280 --> 13:56.480
Uh, mr Ferris, splendid.

13:56.640 --> 14:00.200
How are you? I'll, uh,
I'll catch you later, pippa.

14:00.360 --> 14:03.480
Sorry. Yes, of
course. Yes, I'll...

14:03.640 --> 14:07.000
If... if you want, um,
a coffee any time or...

14:07.160 --> 14:08.800
- Coffee. Yes.
- Yes, yes.

14:08.960 --> 14:10.960
Uh, um, so, mr Ferris,

14:11.120 --> 14:14.880
your pre-surgical psychological
assessment for bariatric surgery

14:15.040 --> 14:16.080
has gone very well.

14:16.240 --> 14:18.240
- So, it's an a-star.
- A-star.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.000
We only have a
small area of concern

14:20.160 --> 14:22.560
around your impulsive
behaviour scores.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.840
Yes, well, I've just
asked the nurse here

14:25.000 --> 14:27.520
if she'd elope with
me to gretna green.

14:27.680 --> 14:29.160
- I agreed.
- [Laughs]

14:29.320 --> 14:31.216
- Well, it's really more a method...
- [Machine beeps]

14:31.240 --> 14:34.840
Oh, dear. Is this bed right?
Or... Or is the floor uneven?

14:35.000 --> 14:37.960
Shall I, um, shall I get
sister to call estates?

14:38.120 --> 14:41.120
Nigel: No, no. It's... It's
just rather odd. [Laughs]

14:41.280 --> 14:43.080
So, uh, we'd like
to put in place

14:43.240 --> 14:46.320
a post-operative psychological
support programme

14:46.480 --> 14:48.760
to prevent you ignoring
dietary restrictions

14:48.920 --> 14:51.480
and maybe eating
solids way too soon.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.520
I liquidised a crunchie
once. It was lovely.

14:54.680 --> 14:58.600
Yes. But, the kind of thing
we should be avoiding.

15:00.120 --> 15:02.840
Yeah, well, we've tried
1,500 different combinations

15:03.000 --> 15:04.320
and none of them work.

15:04.480 --> 15:06.440
Plus we've tried everyone
on the ward's birthdays.

15:06.520 --> 15:09.480
Thank you. I'd be very grateful.

15:09.640 --> 15:11.400
Sister, can I see you
in your office, please?

15:11.560 --> 15:12.880
Well, no, because I'm busy.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.280
Den, please.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.160
[Sighs] All right.

15:20.840 --> 15:22.280
Who put these on?

15:24.440 --> 15:25.520
It's a bit dark.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.120
- Oh.
- Can you turn it back on?

15:27.280 --> 15:28.520
I've got something to show you.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.520
Yeah. I thought we were
supposed to be keeping...

15:30.680 --> 15:32.800
No, turn 'em both
on. It's... it's fine.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.200
[Whispers] That's better.

15:34.360 --> 15:36.240
- Yeah. What is it?
- This is for you.

15:40.640 --> 15:41.680
Open it.

15:47.960 --> 15:48.960
I hope you like it.

15:50.360 --> 15:52.800
It was the best one
they had in the shop.

15:52.960 --> 15:55.280
There was three options.

15:55.440 --> 15:57.560
Oh, thanks. Thanks so much!

15:57.720 --> 16:00.320
- Thank you. That's...
- Thanks.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.520
Listen, den, no strings,

16:02.680 --> 16:05.680
but if you ever need
anything, financial support,

16:05.840 --> 16:08.240
or just someone for the
nipper to kick a ball around with.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.680
Kim: Ooh, you're a doctor.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.840
- I'm just about to start my training.
- Ooh, very impressive.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.840
You could take your
own blood pressure, then?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.160
Only if I was r2-d2.

16:21.320 --> 16:25.400
My doctorate is in robotics
and intelligent machines.

16:25.560 --> 16:27.320
Blimey! Well, if
you're that clever,

16:27.480 --> 16:30.440
maybe you can decipher
my 2,000-word essay title?

16:30.600 --> 16:33.080
- Yeah, well, let me have a look at it.
- Really?

16:33.240 --> 16:36.080
Got my laptop and a
long weekend ahead.

16:36.240 --> 16:37.416
We can get to the bottom of it.

16:37.440 --> 16:39.080
Great. So, you'll help me?

16:39.240 --> 16:41.760
Well, we're engaged, aren't we?

16:41.920 --> 16:44.960
It's just a shame you can't
order in a Chinese meal for two.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.960
We can. I'll eat yours.

16:47.120 --> 16:48.520
[Snorts]

16:48.680 --> 16:50.160
[Machine whirrs]

16:50.320 --> 16:52.680
Whatever it is, I
don't want to know.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.160
Okay.

17:05.360 --> 17:06.600
[Sniffs]

17:40.040 --> 17:43.560
Uh, Josh. Right. Have you got
some pics there? Let's have a look.

17:46.440 --> 17:50.640
No, that's good. Yes, that could
do with a crop, though, if you...

17:50.800 --> 17:52.120
No, that's...

17:52.280 --> 17:54.000
Oh, these are rather
washed out, aren't they?

17:54.160 --> 17:56.456
Do you think... can we... Is
there any mileage in auto-correct?

17:56.480 --> 17:59.120
Is there anything you can... no?

17:59.280 --> 18:01.360
All right. Well,
uh, sorry, Josh.

18:01.520 --> 18:03.096
I think you're going to
have to do these again.

18:03.120 --> 18:05.440
Um, all right? Jolly good!

18:05.600 --> 18:08.000
Yes, looking, looking,
uh, looking, you know.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.680
What kind of moron would think

18:15.840 --> 18:18.360
that a wooden coffee
stirrer is infectious?

18:18.520 --> 18:21.200
Oh, well, maybe someone
with a cold licked it.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.080
- No.
- Oh, hils, I...

18:23.240 --> 18:26.440
You... you should just be
observing for your skills mix review.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.080
You don't need to
be getting involved

18:28.240 --> 18:30.680
in this wasters and
losers' programme.

18:30.840 --> 18:32.536
And you don't need to
be holding that heavy bag.

18:32.560 --> 18:33.560
Let me take that for you.

18:33.680 --> 18:37.600
Oh. Thank you.

18:37.760 --> 18:41.280
And thanks for the baby's
presents. That was...

18:41.440 --> 18:43.480
That was nice of
you, really nice of you.

18:43.640 --> 18:46.240
I would never put you
through a paternity test.

18:46.400 --> 18:49.960
You know that it is only, like,
1% chance, don't you, that...

18:50.120 --> 18:51.960
That it could be yours?

18:52.120 --> 18:53.880
There's still a chance, though.

18:54.040 --> 18:56.400
Let the children's laughter

18:56.560 --> 19:00.800
remind us how it used to be.

19:00.960 --> 19:04.480
[Humming Whitney Houston's
the greatest love of all]

19:06.520 --> 19:09.000
Kim: That sounds
like foxes mating, den.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.360
2,007. That's not bad.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.760
Annapurna's already
tipped over the 10,000.

19:16.920 --> 19:19.600
Yeah, well, that's 'cause
we've got hilary up our arses.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.880
Kim, I can't help thinking
we're entering a minefield

19:22.040 --> 19:25.240
of health and safety implications
with this new green initiative.

19:25.400 --> 19:29.520
Oh, I've put you both on the rota
for the picket line on Thursday.

19:29.680 --> 19:32.040
Uh, den, I've got
you down for 11.15,

19:32.200 --> 19:36.000
and Kim for the afternoon
slot unless you can do all day?

19:36.160 --> 19:39.720
It'll probably be all right. I just have
to sort out my return to study course.

19:39.880 --> 19:41.520
- How's all that going?
- Yeah, all right.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.520
I just need to
find a mentor now.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.720
Well, you scratch my
back, and I'll scratch yours.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.400
Completed my
mentorship model in '09.

19:47.560 --> 19:49.600
I won't actually be able
to do the picket now.

19:49.760 --> 19:50.920
Why?

19:51.080 --> 19:53.440
I can't stand. I'm pregnant.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.136
Oh, no, you can have
a chair if you want.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.376
Well, I was thinking of using
the time to get the baby buggy

19:57.400 --> 19:59.000
before I go on maternity
leave, you know?

19:59.160 --> 20:02.280
Yeah, but the reason that you're
entitled to maternity leave at all

20:02.440 --> 20:04.400
is because men and women
have stood on picket lines

20:04.520 --> 20:05.776
for decades to give
you that advantage.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.040
[Sighs]

20:07.200 --> 20:08.416
Well, you wouldn't
cross a picket line.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.280
- Would you, Kim?
- No.

20:10.440 --> 20:12.216
I'm not actually going to cross a
picket line. I'm going to the shops.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.440
Oh, come off it,
den. Fair's fair.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.320
Aiden is a small businessman.

20:16.480 --> 20:19.080
He doesn't get any kind of
pensions, so nothing's fair, is it?

20:19.240 --> 20:21.840
Hansley doesn't even get
sick pay, do you, hansley?

20:22.000 --> 20:25.280
And that's because hansley
is not allowed to join a union.

20:25.440 --> 20:26.920
Are you, hansley?

20:28.680 --> 20:29.680
Sorry.

20:41.600 --> 20:44.720
He must be the highest-paid
binman in the nhs.

20:44.880 --> 20:49.120
Oh, god! Well, do you think mrs
dethick's ready for her close-up?

20:49.280 --> 20:51.920
Yeah, but I mean it's not exactly
going to be a voguecover, is it,

20:52.080 --> 20:54.520
the hanging bacon of Babylon?

20:54.680 --> 20:56.961
Den: Oh, I think I'd better go
and supervise Mario testino.

20:57.080 --> 20:58.480
Kim: Okay.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.760
- Hello.
- Fancy a bit of exercise?

21:04.920 --> 21:07.640
- Oh, yes indeedy.
- Righty-ho, then.

21:11.160 --> 21:15.160
Always use the title of the
essay in the opening sentence.

21:15.320 --> 21:18.040
So, it will be
something like, uh...
