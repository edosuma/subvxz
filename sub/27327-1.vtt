LOUIS: When we were kids,
our mom made us write a letter

00:20.281 --> 00:21.412
to one another...

00:23.153 --> 00:24.067
and told us
we weren't allowed

00:24.198 --> 00:25.112
to open it for 10 years.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.464
We were fighting at the time,
and I was mad at him

00:29.594 --> 00:31.031
because he broke
my roller blades.

00:32.509 --> 00:33.424
We were eight.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.688
She has the letters
buried somewhere,

00:36.819 --> 00:38.821
with the rest of our shit
from when we were kids...

00:38.951 --> 00:39.952
I think.

00:41.824 --> 00:42.868
She works a lot.

00:44.218 --> 00:45.175
But we still have
pizza and movie nights

00:45.306 --> 00:47.438
every now and then.

00:47.569 --> 00:49.353
We used to do them every week

00:49.484 --> 00:51.355
when we were a family,
but now it's... whenever.

00:53.183 --> 00:54.228
FELIX: Hey, I got it.

00:57.013 --> 00:58.362
This one's going to be
really simple.

00:59.711 --> 01:00.886
They always keep
their back door open

01:01.017 --> 01:02.801
for deliveries, right.

01:02.932 --> 01:05.065
So, we're going in,
use door stoppers

01:05.194 --> 01:07.371
to keep it shut
from the inside.

01:07.502 --> 01:09.591
Once we get what we want,
we'll just take off

01:09.721 --> 01:11.810
through this door here,
exit to the field.

01:11.941 --> 01:13.029
- There's an entrance here,
why don't we just go out here,

01:13.160 --> 01:14.204
it'll be way quicker.

01:16.424 --> 01:17.294
- Doesn't matter,
you go out that way.

01:17.425 --> 01:18.513
I'll go out that way.

01:20.645 --> 01:21.951
- You think
you're faster than me?

01:22.082 --> 01:23.344
- I know I'm faster than you.

01:24.693 --> 01:26.477
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:26.608 --> 01:28.131
- First one around the track,
bitch! Bitch!

01:31.308 --> 01:34.268
[laughter]

01:39.316 --> 01:40.622
- Fuck you!

FELIX:
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

01:51.023 --> 01:52.460
LOUIS: Stay the fuck back.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.814
FELIX: Come here, Louis,
give me a hug.

[gasping]

02:56.219 --> 02:57.525
- Head down,
you immigrant fuck!

02:57.655 --> 02:59.353
- Empty the fucking register,
now!

02:59.483 --> 03:01.790
- Say one fucking word
and we'll report your ass

03:01.920 --> 03:04.227
and get you sent back to
whatever fucking shit hole,

03:04.358 --> 03:05.707
you motherfucker.
- Hurry the fuck up!

03:05.837 --> 03:06.708
- That's fucking it?

03:06.838 --> 03:07.752
Let's go!

03:07.883 --> 03:08.971
- Get going!

03:10.190 --> 03:11.669
- Keep your fucking mouth shut!

03:11.800 --> 03:12.975
Fuck!

03:13.105 --> 03:14.629
Shut the fuck up!

pizza's getting cold.

05:43.168 --> 05:44.213

MISHA: The love
of Clay's life died

06:01.491 --> 06:03.450
at a house party
a couple of years ago.

06:03.580 --> 06:04.929
She took some
prescription drugs

06:05.060 --> 06:06.496
and mixed it with booze.

06:06.627 --> 06:07.584
Choked on her own puke

06:07.715 --> 06:09.107
while Clay was passed out
next to her.

06:11.066 --> 06:13.460
I can tell
he always thinks about it.

06:13.590 --> 06:14.765
Sometimes he wakes me up
in the night

06:14.896 --> 06:16.245
just to make sure
I'm still breathing.

06:18.203 --> 06:19.727
We argued about what happens
when you die.

06:21.729 --> 06:23.208
I think when you die,
you get a memorial page made,

06:23.339 --> 06:25.341
and people like it.

06:25.472 --> 06:26.821
Over the years,
less and less people

06:26.951 --> 06:29.040
will post about it till
you're completely forgotten.

06:30.912 --> 06:32.392
We were together
for seven months.

06:34.176 --> 06:36.178
He was always so sad.

06:39.442 --> 06:40.965
I unliked her page
this morning.

07:26.271 --> 07:28.273
- Morning.
- Morning!

07:33.365 --> 07:35.237
- Float's been counted already.

07:35.367 --> 07:37.805
- Oh?
Is Aubrey here already?

07:37.935 --> 07:39.241
- Aubrey isn't even here yet.

07:39.371 --> 07:40.547
I did it.

07:42.244 --> 07:43.941
- Okay. Um...

07:46.291 --> 07:47.815
so what's going on,
what's the scoop then?

07:49.599 --> 07:51.601
- Uh, I think we should
focus on returns,

07:51.732 --> 07:53.690
- and keeping the store clean.
- Mm-hmm.

07:53.821 --> 07:55.387
- All that bullshit,
same old stuff.

07:55.518 --> 07:56.606
- Yeah, what else?

07:59.217 --> 08:03.178
- Uh, what am I missing?

08:03.308 --> 08:05.833
- Hmm... pushing the sales,
spring's out the door,

08:05.963 --> 08:07.182
2-for-1 we gotta
start making room

08:07.312 --> 08:09.010
for some of this summer shit
that we're getting in.

08:12.187 --> 08:13.362
- Right.

08:15.146 --> 08:15.930
- Hey!
MISHA: Hey!

08:16.060 --> 08:17.061
LAURA: Hey!

08:18.498 --> 08:19.847
- Devin and I hung out.

08:19.977 --> 08:22.763
- Oooh!
- Shut up!

08:22.893 --> 08:25.505
- So, uh, how long
have you two been together?

08:27.028 --> 08:28.246
- I wouldn't say "together".

08:28.377 --> 08:29.509
- Hmm.

08:29.639 --> 08:31.554
- Well, I thought
you guys were dating?

08:31.685 --> 08:33.077
- We've gone on dates.

08:34.601 --> 08:35.818
- Hmm-huh.

08:35.950 --> 08:37.125
- Yeah.

08:38.429 --> 08:39.736
- Morning, girls.

08:39.866 --> 08:41.259
- Hey!
- Hey!

08:41.390 --> 08:42.347
- Morning!

08:46.395 --> 08:47.788
- Do you think
we're doing reviews today?

08:47.918 --> 08:49.137
- I don't know.

08:49.267 --> 08:50.965
Last year took
like a month to do.

08:51.095 --> 08:52.880
- Yeah, season change
really slows things down.

08:54.490 --> 08:56.231
- How much
did you make last year?

08:56.361 --> 08:58.668
- Huh... three bucks.

08:58.799 --> 09:00.975
- Yeah but,
she's fucking teacher's pet, so.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.544
No, but, if I were
a betting man,

09:04.674 --> 09:07.198
I'd say that you're next in line
for something big.

09:07.329 --> 09:08.809
I mean, you're already
training everyone already.

09:10.767 --> 09:13.335
I'll quit if I don't get
three bucks this year.

09:13.465 --> 09:14.379
I don't know
how they expect us

09:14.510 --> 09:17.252
to make a living
off of $16 an hour.

09:17.382 --> 09:19.689
- You don't pay rent.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.473
- How does that mean
that I don't need more money?

09:21.604 --> 09:22.866
- Okay, look,
all I'm saying is

09:22.997 --> 09:26.348
I've had to pay rent
ever since I've gotten a job.

09:26.478 --> 09:27.871
Just saying.

09:28.002 --> 09:30.178
- If you're late, do you get
a notice or something?

09:32.180 --> 09:34.399
- No, actually, now my parents
have access to my account,

09:34.530 --> 09:36.576
so they basically control it.

09:36.706 --> 09:38.229
Every pay day,
they take whatever I make,

09:38.360 --> 09:40.884
throw it into savings,
and then I get an allowance

09:41.015 --> 09:41.972
of whatever I make.

09:42.103 --> 09:43.321
Does that answer your question?

09:44.714 --> 09:45.933
- So crazy.

09:48.239 --> 09:49.893
But you must have
a bunch of money saved up?

09:51.416 --> 09:53.897
- Well, yeah,
they have money saved up for me.

09:54.028 --> 09:57.509
But I don't get it
'til I'm responsible enough.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.860
AUBREY: Misha,
can you come here, please?

10:01.426 --> 10:02.776
- Coming.

10:05.256 --> 10:07.041
[tapping on keyboard]

10:07.171 --> 10:07.998
AUBREY:
So you've been with us

10:08.129 --> 10:09.086
for two years now.

10:09.217 --> 10:10.044
So this isn't
your first review,

10:10.174 --> 10:11.393
you know how
these things go.

10:11.523 --> 10:14.091
We'll go over
your overall performance,

10:14.222 --> 10:15.527
and see where
you rank yourself,

10:15.658 --> 10:16.833
and discuss
where I think you are

10:16.964 --> 10:18.966
in your current stage
with us.

10:19.096 --> 10:20.228
- Okay.

10:20.358 --> 10:22.534
- Before we begin,
it's important to know

10:22.665 --> 10:24.580
that whatever is said
in this room

10:24.711 --> 10:26.495
stays in this room.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.888
- Right.
- Shall we continue?

10:28.018 --> 10:31.065
- Yeah.
- First section is attendance.

10:31.195 --> 10:32.588
I mean, you've been here
when we needed you.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.503
There was that one issue
with sick days

10:34.634 --> 10:36.070
but we figured that out.

10:36.200 --> 10:40.248
And moving onward,
for overall performance,

10:40.378 --> 10:44.121
you ranked yourself as
"exceeds expectations".

10:45.470 --> 10:47.211
Just to define,
so we're clear.

10:47.342 --> 10:49.605
Uh, this means
a combination of things.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.259
Mostly how the customer
perceives you

10:51.389 --> 10:53.261
when they come into the store.

10:53.391 --> 10:56.438
Are you personable,
are you friendly,

10:56.568 --> 10:58.875
how's your knowledge,
that sort of thing.

10:59.006 --> 11:01.661
Do you still think
you fall under that category?

11:01.791 --> 11:04.576
- Yeah, for sure.
[giggling]

11:08.102 --> 11:10.321
- Okay, this year,
I've received more customer

11:10.452 --> 11:13.368
complaints than any other year
since I started this job,

11:13.498 --> 11:16.806
and most of those complaints
can be tied back to you.

11:19.330 --> 11:20.505
I'm just going to come right out
and say it,

11:20.636 --> 11:22.899
this has been a pretty big
down-year for you.

11:23.030 --> 11:24.118
I don't know what it is, but,

11:24.248 --> 11:26.555
there are a lot of areas
that need improvement.

11:28.644 --> 11:30.646
I'm going to put your future
in your hands.

11:32.561 --> 11:35.085
There are two options,
and I want to hear your answer

11:35.216 --> 11:36.478
by the end of the week.

11:36.608 --> 11:38.610
You can either take no pay raise
for the next year

11:38.741 --> 11:40.003
or you can quit.

11:40.134 --> 11:42.832
You will not be terminated,
or laid off,

11:42.963 --> 11:46.314
it's completely up to you
how you want to proceed.

11:46.444 --> 11:49.839
I mean, I should mention to you
that if this was anyone but you,

11:49.970 --> 11:51.449
they would be fired,

11:51.580 --> 11:52.755
I'm only giving you
this opportunity

11:52.886 --> 11:54.757
because we've been a team
for so long.

11:56.063 --> 11:57.325
Think about it.

11:57.455 --> 11:58.500
Get back to me.

12:08.292 --> 12:09.293
- Let's go!

12:18.041 --> 12:19.477
- Lex!

12:19.608 --> 12:20.740
I have the keys.

12:28.573 --> 12:30.575
- Come on, Mish.
- Hold on.

12:41.543 --> 12:43.632
[shouting]

12:45.199 --> 12:47.549
- Let's go, boys!
Go ahead, motherfucker!

12:47.679 --> 12:51.248
[overlapping conversation]

12:51.379 --> 12:52.597
- What are you looking at?
- Fuck you, Carson,

12:52.728 --> 12:53.903
you're a bitch.

12:54.034 --> 12:56.384
- Two hundred bucks,
I'll take this guy?

12:56.514 --> 12:58.081
- Fuck it, fuck it,
fuck it, fuck it,

12:58.212 --> 13:00.910
we'll take this guy,
500 bucks, let's go.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.259
- Alright.
- Fuck yeah, nah,

13:02.390 --> 13:03.826
it's good, man, trust me,
this guy's fucking tough, man,

13:03.957 --> 13:04.871
I've seen him fight before.

13:05.001 --> 13:06.046
It's good.
- Look, how shook he looks!

13:06.176 --> 13:08.744
- Who's shook?
- We got this, man, we got this.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.615
[overlapping conversation]

13:10.746 --> 13:12.792
- Come on.

13:12.922 --> 13:14.141
- There you go,
there you go!

13:14.271 --> 13:15.664
[crowd cheering]

13:15.795 --> 13:17.057
- That's it, buddy.
- Hit him.

13:17.187 --> 13:18.885
- Push, fucking savage!
Go, man!

13:20.277 --> 13:23.063
[crowd shouting and cheering]

13:24.325 --> 13:25.630
- I wanna see blood,
motherfucker!

13:33.856 --> 13:34.814
- There you go,
there you go!

13:34.944 --> 13:35.815
- Come on!

13:42.212 --> 13:44.040
- There you go,
he's done, he's done!

13:45.346 --> 13:46.303
- Get the fuck up!

13:46.434 --> 13:47.739
- Get up, man!

13:47.870 --> 13:50.525
- That's what's up, boys,
that's what's up.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.266
- Let's go,
let's go, come on!

13:52.396 --> 13:53.571
Finish him!

13:53.702 --> 13:56.096
- Fuck.
- [brakes squealing]

13:56.226 --> 13:57.314
- [police siren beeping]
- Oh, shit, fuck!

13:57.445 --> 13:58.533
Cops, cops, cops, cops!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

13:58.663 --> 13:59.839
- Get him! Get him!

14:04.713 --> 14:09.152
- Oh fuck,
oh fuck, the fuck!

14:09.283 --> 14:11.328
- What the fuck man, fuck you!
- [Felix groaning]

14:11.459 --> 14:12.852
Oh, fuck!

14:12.982 --> 14:13.940
- You good? You good?

14:14.070 --> 14:15.028
Come on, come on,
we gotta get up.

14:15.158 --> 14:15.942
Come on, cops are coming.

14:17.465 --> 14:18.814
- Come on, get the fuck!
- The fuck happened?

14:27.649 --> 14:29.390
MISHA: It's not his either.

14:29.520 --> 14:30.565
[giggles]

14:32.567 --> 14:33.698
His parents,
they should have

14:33.829 --> 14:34.917
known better
than having him.

14:35.048 --> 14:36.832
- I just want more for you.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.399
You know?
You're such a good friend.

14:38.529 --> 14:39.661
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

14:42.838 --> 14:44.318
- Is that Devin?

14:44.448 --> 14:46.668
- Oh, my god.
- Holy shit.

14:49.279 --> 14:51.020
Devin! Devin!

14:57.635 --> 14:58.723
- Go!

14:58.854 --> 15:00.377
- Holy fuck,
what's going on!

15:00.508 --> 15:02.510
- Andy or Adam or whoever
was fighting that fucking kid

15:02.640 --> 15:04.033
who used to go to Merc.
- Did he win?

15:04.164 --> 15:06.209
- Uh... he got laid out.

15:06.340 --> 15:07.471
Cops came,
everybody started running.

15:07.602 --> 15:09.169
- This one night at work,

15:09.299 --> 15:11.736
there was this huge fight
just outside.

15:11.867 --> 15:15.218
This one guy lost his jacket,
I think his name was Peter,

15:15.349 --> 15:17.090
and this other guy took it
while he was changing

15:17.220 --> 15:19.048
or trying something on.

15:19.179 --> 15:21.877
Anyway, Peter grabs him
in the middle of the mall,

15:22.008 --> 15:23.748
tells him to give him back
his jacket.

15:23.879 --> 15:26.577
This guy says he doesn't have
a fucking clue where it is,

15:26.708 --> 15:28.536
meanwhile his buddy
has it behind him.

15:28.666 --> 15:30.973
So, Peter grabs the guy
by the fucking throat,

15:31.104 --> 15:32.235
tells him,
"Give it back to me,

15:32.366 --> 15:34.890
or else I can't be
responsible for what I do".

15:35.021 --> 15:37.893
This guy laughs
in his fucking face,

15:38.024 --> 15:40.461
so Peter punches him
right in the face,

15:40.591 --> 15:42.985
gushed up his nose,
BOOM, right to the ground.

15:43.116 --> 15:44.247
"Give me back my coat".

15:44.378 --> 15:45.945
Then he punched him,
"Give me back my coat",

15:46.075 --> 15:47.685
then he punched him again.

15:47.816 --> 15:50.775
Finally, this guy,
fucking covered in blood,

15:50.906 --> 15:52.168
tells his buddy
to give him back his coat.

15:52.299 --> 15:53.778
- Jesus Christ!

15:53.909 --> 15:55.867
- Peter comes into the store
and asks to use the phone.

15:55.998 --> 15:58.870
Turns out he's got like
two G's cash in his pocket,

15:59.001 --> 16:00.872
and like, a bunch of coke.

16:01.003 --> 16:03.701
Fucking would have never
thought that guy was a fighter.

16:03.832 --> 16:07.270
Skinny, like lanky,
this other guy - jacked.

16:08.663 --> 16:10.795
- Yeah, well, one-on-ones
never happen anymore.

16:10.926 --> 16:12.275
Somebody jumps in,
somebody's got a knife,

16:12.406 --> 16:14.190
it's fucking stupid.

16:14.321 --> 16:16.279
- Uh,
do you want a ride somewhere?

16:16.410 --> 16:17.585
- Yeah, home would be great

16:17.715 --> 16:18.803
if it's not too far
out of your way.

16:18.934 --> 16:21.284
- It's fine, we got shit
all to do now, anyway.

16:21.415 --> 16:22.590
- Yeah.

16:22.720 --> 16:23.808
- Aren't y'all
supposed to be at work?

16:23.939 --> 16:26.463
- Got the can,
kicked to the fucking curb.

16:26.594 --> 16:28.552
- For real?
- Yeah.

16:28.683 --> 16:30.424
Loyalty means nothing
these days.

16:30.554 --> 16:31.773
- Money does,
you should know that.

16:31.903 --> 16:34.341
Cash rules everything,
there will always be someone

16:34.471 --> 16:35.907
willing to make less money
than you,

16:36.038 --> 16:38.040
and then there will be someone
willing to make less than them.

16:38.171 --> 16:39.868
It's the circle of life
or some shit.

16:50.270 --> 16:51.314
- You guys want to
come in for a bit?

16:52.620 --> 16:53.795
- Sure.

16:53.925 --> 16:55.405
- Cool.

17:00.715 --> 17:02.151
- We'll leave soon, I promise.

17:04.066 --> 17:05.067
- Okay.

17:29.613 --> 17:30.484
- When was the last time
you just went out

17:30.614 --> 17:32.573
and scoured the streets
for trouble?

17:32.703 --> 17:34.531
Eh?

17:34.662 --> 17:37.230
Like just go
and break something,

17:37.360 --> 17:39.058
just to do it.

17:42.757 --> 17:45.064
You guys are
an inside generation,

17:45.194 --> 17:47.370
you know what I mean?
You live indoors, I swear.

17:48.893 --> 17:51.287
Fellow that I work with,
he went to put his kids

17:51.418 --> 17:53.463
in Little League,
and I tell ya what,

17:53.594 --> 17:57.554
they didn't have enough players
to fill one single team.

17:57.685 --> 17:59.730
That's 'cuz nobody's doing
anything anymore, you know.

17:59.861 --> 18:02.081
Like, when I was your age,

18:02.211 --> 18:07.216
I mean, we'd go out and fucking
egg houses, you know, for fun.

18:07.347 --> 18:09.827
[laughs]

18:09.958 --> 18:11.655
We'd just meet up
and walk around, you know.

18:11.786 --> 18:13.701
When was the last time
you just went and walked around?

18:16.182 --> 18:19.446
- Fuck, you're so old,
Steve. [giggles]

18:19.576 --> 18:22.362
- I feel bad for you guys,
you know, I do.

18:23.580 --> 18:24.494
[lighter clicks]

18:28.281 --> 18:30.674
- Steve,
you work out at the plant?

18:32.937 --> 18:34.025
- Yup.

18:35.940 --> 18:36.767
What?
Oh, this?

18:36.898 --> 18:39.292
[giggles]

18:41.120 --> 18:42.512
You only get in trouble
if you get tested,

18:42.643 --> 18:44.993
and you only get tested
on your first day

18:45.124 --> 18:47.126
and if you have an accident.

18:47.256 --> 18:48.649
- Have you ever been
in an accident?

18:49.911 --> 18:53.044
- Oh, yeah. [giggles]

18:53.175 --> 18:55.569
I got sent to rehab, twice.

18:55.699 --> 19:01.140
[laughs, coughs]

19:01.270 --> 19:02.750
- And you still have your job?

19:02.880 --> 19:03.881
- Oh, fuck, yeah.

19:05.274 --> 19:06.623
I'll tell ya,
they'd rather put the time

19:06.754 --> 19:08.843
into rehabilitating me
than give the job to some nigger

19:08.973 --> 19:11.367
who can't speak
a lick of English, you know.

19:11.498 --> 19:13.978
Fucking fresh into town
cuz his cab buddies told him

19:14.109 --> 19:16.807
he can make all kinds of money
up here, fuck.

19:16.938 --> 19:18.026
[clears throat]

19:19.636 --> 19:21.856
Fuck, when I found this guy,
he had a backpack of clothes

19:21.986 --> 19:24.337
and he was hitchhiking
on the fucking Coquihalla.

19:32.083 --> 19:33.520
- So, you ever gonna
get your shit?

19:35.174 --> 19:36.175
- Nah.

19:38.568 --> 19:39.352
I didn't have much anyway.

19:40.483 --> 19:42.311
Fuck it.

19:42.442 --> 19:45.358
My life's here now,
I owe this guy for that.

19:48.099 --> 19:50.450
- Gave you a fucking ride,
place to stay,

19:50.580 --> 19:52.234
some fuckin' spending money.

19:54.715 --> 19:55.498
It's like I'm your old man!

19:56.847 --> 19:58.806
- Yeah, okay, pops.

19:58.936 --> 20:00.677
- And you're okay
with having this freeloader

20:00.808 --> 20:01.591
just hanging around?

20:01.722 --> 20:02.723
- Oh, yeah.

20:04.638 --> 20:07.554
I mean, I make more money
than I know what to do with, eh.

20:07.684 --> 20:10.209
He's nice. Nice to have
some company sometime.

20:11.775 --> 20:13.124
He's a good kid.

20:15.605 --> 20:17.128
There's perks to
having him around, you know?

20:18.956 --> 20:21.611
[puffing air loudly]

20:27.313 --> 20:28.575
- I'm okay, thanks.

20:28.705 --> 20:29.663
- You sure?

20:30.751 --> 20:31.926
- Okay.

20:46.767 --> 20:47.681
- Hey.

20:49.509 --> 20:51.032
Everything okay?

20:51.162 --> 20:54.035
- Yeah,
I just wanna leave soon.

20:54.165 --> 20:56.820
Weed makes me sleepy,
I don't wanna fall asleep here.

20:56.951 --> 20:57.865
- Okay.

20:57.995 --> 21:00.476
Soon, I promise.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.453
- Hey, Alexa,
let me show you something.

21:22.237 --> 21:25.022
[siren sounding at a distance]

21:27.590 --> 21:28.765
- I'll be a sec.
- Just hurry,

21:28.896 --> 21:30.289
or I'll leave without you.

21:36.599 --> 21:37.513
- Hey...

21:38.862 --> 21:39.820
come have a sit.

21:45.129 --> 21:47.654
[sniffling and clearing throat]

21:59.535 --> 22:00.580
[sighing]

22:04.235 --> 22:05.672
- It's a nice spot you got here.

22:06.977 --> 22:09.371
- Ah... yeah, it's alright.

22:09.502 --> 22:12.548
- It's your own,
at least you can call it that.

22:12.679 --> 22:15.072
- This place?
No, no, no.

22:15.203 --> 22:17.379
Someone else owns it,
I just rent 'er.

22:17.510 --> 22:18.467
- Oh.

22:26.910 --> 22:28.608
- So, you born here or...?

22:30.349 --> 22:31.654
- Born and raised.

22:35.441 --> 22:37.356
How 'bout you,
where are you from?

22:37.486 --> 22:38.618
- I'm from here.

22:41.664 --> 22:42.491
- No, you're not.

22:42.622 --> 22:43.927
- Yes, I am.

22:44.058 --> 22:45.059
- No.

22:47.714 --> 22:49.672
- What are you asking me?

22:49.803 --> 22:51.587
- Where's your hometown?

22:51.718 --> 22:53.937
- This is my home.

22:54.068 --> 22:55.330
- No, there's a difference.

23:00.204 --> 23:01.162
- What's the difference?

23:01.292 --> 23:02.859
- Where were you born?

23:02.990 --> 23:03.947
Where were you born?

23:04.078 --> 23:06.733
- I was born in DC.

23:06.863 --> 23:08.169
Where the good stuff grows.

23:12.478 --> 23:15.611
Holy fuck, my manners,
sorry, there.

23:17.004 --> 23:18.614
There you go.

23:18.745 --> 23:19.615
Yeah.

23:24.925 --> 23:26.535
[groaning]

23:26.666 --> 23:27.841
[turning switch on]

23:31.888 --> 23:33.063
Just uh...

23:39.287 --> 23:41.855
[grunting]

23:41.985 --> 23:44.074
Until the price of oil
goes down considerably,

23:44.205 --> 23:46.033
this is my home.
I'm from here now.

23:48.296 --> 23:50.690
I used to have a woman
and a kid back in DC,

23:50.820 --> 23:54.868
but, things between me
and the missus went sour

23:54.998 --> 23:58.393
and she didn't like me
coming and going all the time,

23:58.524 --> 24:00.090
leaving her on her own.

24:01.570 --> 24:02.658
And the kid...

24:05.182 --> 24:06.488
uh... the boy...

24:08.534 --> 24:10.405
well, I hardly know him.

24:13.321 --> 24:17.281
My shift, it switches,
it's 21 on, seven off,

24:17.412 --> 24:20.676
and it's pretty easy
to figure out

24:20.807 --> 24:22.504
I chose to stay here, you know.

24:24.419 --> 24:26.813
Work my ass off
so my boy can have a good life.

24:31.774 --> 24:32.775
- How old is he?

24:34.255 --> 24:35.212
- That's not important.

24:37.388 --> 24:39.086
You know, Devin's not from
around here either.

24:40.348 --> 24:41.218
- Mmm-hmm.

24:42.698 --> 24:46.963
- Well, one night,
I was driving back down from...

24:47.094 --> 24:48.225
- Yeah, you were saying?

24:49.749 --> 24:50.793
- Oh, I was too.

24:55.102 --> 24:56.495
I gotta...
I gotta put this down.

24:57.800 --> 25:00.020
[giggling]

25:00.150 --> 25:01.674
I gotta put this thing down.

25:05.678 --> 25:06.896
- Do you miss your kid?

25:11.901 --> 25:14.034
- That's a stupid question,
of course I do.

25:18.386 --> 25:21.389
But fuck,
if we're being honest,

25:21.520 --> 25:23.696
sometimes I don't--
I don't even think about him.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.746
That doesn't make me a bad guy,
does it, I mean?

25:30.877 --> 25:33.401
- When was the last time
you saw him?

25:33.532 --> 25:36.143
- Three months ago,
four months ago?

25:36.273 --> 25:38.145
I took him into the woods,
taught him to shoot.

25:40.016 --> 25:41.540
You know,
line up cans on the fence,

25:41.670 --> 25:43.193
take turns shooting 'em down.

25:47.894 --> 25:52.638
You know...
you know, I like to think

25:52.768 --> 25:54.161
I'm a pretty simple guy,
you know.

25:55.771 --> 25:58.078
I go to work,
I come home.

25:58.208 --> 25:59.949
I have a little toke.

26:00.080 --> 26:01.298
I get to relax.

26:03.823 --> 26:08.349
You know, I make enough money
to take care of my life,

26:08.479 --> 26:10.307
cover my life,
you know, pay for all,

26:10.438 --> 26:13.006
everything...
and those around me.

26:16.313 --> 26:17.184
I'm a good guy.

26:20.056 --> 26:25.235
You know, when I met Devin,
he had nobody.

26:25.366 --> 26:27.629
I mean, nobody.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.283
I mean, at least
my boy's got his mom,

26:29.413 --> 26:34.157
he's got a pretty decent fellow
for a father figure,

26:34.288 --> 26:35.768
he's got me, now and then.

26:40.250 --> 26:41.556
How well do you know Devin?

26:43.645 --> 26:44.951
- Somewhat.

26:45.081 --> 26:46.256
- Is he a good kid?

26:48.128 --> 26:49.390
- Well...

26:53.133 --> 26:58.486
As good as anybody with
no supervision, money, no job.

26:59.792 --> 27:00.836
He's no place to be.

27:02.229 --> 27:03.186
- Hmm.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.799
Where's your place to be?
- I don't know.

27:06.929 --> 27:08.365
Here, I guess.

27:08.496 --> 27:09.453
- Here?

27:10.716 --> 27:12.195
What's here?

27:12.326 --> 27:14.023
- Work and stuff.

27:14.154 --> 27:15.634
[chuckling]

27:15.764 --> 27:17.853
- Work and stuff,
Jesus Christ!

27:17.984 --> 27:19.942
Whole life's not all about work,
at your age.

27:20.073 --> 27:21.944
Are you going...
are you going to school,

27:22.075 --> 27:23.990
are you getting
an education or what?

27:26.470 --> 27:28.908
- It's just,
it's not for me.

27:29.038 --> 27:30.431
- Listen,
I'mma tell you something, okay.

27:32.781 --> 27:37.046
This town is...

27:37.177 --> 27:40.876
it's a well-manicured
hand, okay.

27:42.486 --> 27:44.663
It's got its nails all done up,
nice and pretty,

27:44.793 --> 27:46.099
lots of different little colors,

27:46.229 --> 27:47.230
okay.
- Okay.

27:47.361 --> 27:50.669
- And in that hand,
there is a fork,

27:50.799 --> 27:52.322
okay?
- Okay.

27:52.453 --> 27:54.194
- On the end of that fork
there's a piece of steak,

27:54.324 --> 27:57.153
and it's not-- fuck,

your mouth open,

28:00.679 --> 28:02.855

out of that steak.

28:02.985 --> 28:05.596
You bite the steak,
you don't bite the fork

28:05.727 --> 28:07.555

the fucking hand,

28:07.686 --> 28:08.687

28:10.384 --> 28:12.168
Cuz you don't want to starve,
right?

It's just, it's not for me.

I wanna hear you tell me.

- Watching?

32:02.050 --> 32:03.530
Does this look like
watching?

32:03.660 --> 32:05.271

then some guy just suckered him.

32:05.401 --> 32:06.620

LOUIS: Some guy.

32:06.750 --> 32:08.622

- Just some guy.

I don't know, he just came up
and punched him.

just spend the day in jail

32:23.593 --> 32:24.551

I can't do this on my own.

I need your help.

around here, right?

32:45.311 --> 32:47.182
- Get jobs with me?
LOUIS: Yeah.

32:47.313 --> 32:49.532
I figured we'd always just
work on at the plant with you.

32:49.663 --> 32:52.231
- Yeah, well, it's not that
simple anymore.

32:52.361 --> 32:54.494
When I started, it was nothing.

32:54.624 --> 32:55.582
You didn't even
need to graduate,

32:55.712 --> 32:57.192

32:57.323 --> 33:00.021
Hell, I only have my Grade Ten.

of that pie,

a work ethic,

33:04.504 --> 33:06.897
I can't help you.

I don't wanna know
how you get it.

But you are never ever
going to have a good life

33:23.784 --> 33:25.264

how to work for it.

No, I'm serious.
Get up. Get out.

33:59.080 --> 34:00.081

to pack your bags,

34:00.212 --> 34:01.343
then I want you to find
somewhere else

34:01.474 --> 34:02.344

45:40.520 --> 45:44.785
- No.
- [laughs]

45:46.918 --> 45:47.788
- Yeah.

45:51.661 --> 45:53.925
She didn't talk to me for like
two weeks because of it.

45:55.709 --> 45:56.666
- Really?

45:56.797 --> 45:58.756
- Yeah.

45:58.886 --> 46:02.194
Oh yeah, she's like that.

46:04.152 --> 46:07.199
Do her wrong, and she'll find
a way to punish you for it.

46:11.594 --> 46:13.074
Yeah, those two weeks sucked.

46:16.991 --> 46:18.514
She's my only friend, you know?

46:22.257 --> 46:23.693
But I hung out in the library.

46:30.439 --> 46:31.789
That's where I met Clay.

46:36.271 --> 46:38.186
So, I guess
it wasn't all bad.

46:42.277 --> 46:43.409
- Where is he, anyway?

46:45.237 --> 46:46.064
- Doesn't go out much.

46:53.723 --> 46:54.550
- You remember how we met?

46:57.292 --> 46:58.206
- No.

47:01.340 --> 47:02.297
- Neither do I.

47:02.428 --> 47:04.038
[Misha chuckles]

47:07.259 --> 47:08.042
It's funny, you know.

47:10.392 --> 47:13.221
I can think about
pretty much everybody I know,

47:13.352 --> 47:18.096
and how we met,
but with you, it's like,

47:18.226 --> 47:21.839
all of a sudden,
we're just there.

47:21.969 --> 47:24.363
Already friends, already
knew each other, you know?

47:27.105 --> 47:27.975
- Yeah.

47:32.719 --> 47:33.981
Yeah, I know.

47:38.420 --> 47:39.769
[sighs]

48:28.122 --> 48:31.343
[♪♪♪]

48:37.697 --> 48:38.828
[moans]

48:38.959 --> 48:39.960
- Do you like me?

48:44.660 --> 48:45.661
Huh?

48:47.750 --> 48:49.013
Tell me you like me.

48:57.543 --> 49:00.415
[phone ringing]

49:05.029 --> 49:06.030
RECEPTIONIST [on phone]:
Thank you for calling

49:06.160 --> 49:09.381
Dr. Morgan's office.
How may I help you?

49:09.511 --> 49:14.299
- [on phone]: Um, hey,
I, I was hoping

49:14.429 --> 49:18.912
that I could make an appointment
to get into your clinic...

49:21.001 --> 49:22.872
as soon as possible,
if possible.

49:23.003 --> 49:25.049
RECEPTIONIST:
Okay, let me see.

49:25.179 --> 49:27.225
How does Saturday
at 3:30 PM sound?

49:30.663 --> 49:32.447
- It works for me.

49:32.578 --> 49:34.014
RECEPTIONIST:
Alright, can I get your name?

49:34.145 --> 49:37.626
- Misha Patton,
P-A-T-T-O-N.

49:37.757 --> 49:39.454

and your date of birth?

49:39.585 --> 49:42.414
- January 21st, '95.

49:42.544 --> 49:44.416
RECEPTIONIST: We require
a safe phone number

49:44.546 --> 49:45.634
just in case
we need to contact you

49:45.765 --> 49:47.158
ahead of the appointment.

49:47.288 --> 49:48.637
Is this a private
and safe phone number?

49:50.639 --> 49:52.772
- Yeah,
you can use this number.

49:52.902 --> 49:55.035
RECEPTIONIST: Okay, Misha,
I just have to ask you

49:55.166 --> 49:55.993
a couple of questions.

49:57.516 --> 49:58.865
- Okay.

49:58.996 --> 50:00.910
RECEPTIONIST:
What was the date of first day

50:01.041 --> 50:03.348
of your last normal
menstrual cycle?

50:06.612 --> 50:10.529
MISHA: I'm not 100% sure.

50:10.659 --> 50:12.226
RECEPTIONIST:
That's okay, that's okay.

50:12.357 --> 50:13.575
An intake counselor
can help you with that

50:13.706 --> 50:15.142
when you come in.

50:15.273 --> 50:16.665
MISHA: Okay.

50:16.796 --> 50:18.058
RECEPTIONIST: Have you had
any previous pregnancies

50:18.189 --> 50:20.321
or miscarriages?

50:20.452 --> 50:22.149
MISHA: No.

50:22.280 --> 50:24.108
RECEPTIONIST: Okay,
do you have any allergies?

50:26.501 --> 50:28.938
MISHA: Dogs.

50:29.069 --> 50:31.245
RECEPTIONIST: Do you have
any reactions to medications,

50:31.376 --> 50:32.464
anesthetics, or latex?

50:32.594 --> 50:34.292
MISHA: No.

50:34.422 --> 50:36.207
RECEPTIONIST: Do you have
any health or medical problems?

50:37.904 --> 50:40.080
MISHA: Uh, no.

50:40.211 --> 50:42.430
RECEPTIONIST: Are you
currently on any medications?

50:46.130 --> 50:48.697
MISHA:
Not prescription, no.

50:48.828 --> 50:50.656
RECEPTIONIST: Do you happen
to have a blood test

50:50.786 --> 50:52.136
or get an ultrasound done?

50:53.485 --> 50:54.703
MISHA: Uh...

50:56.183 --> 50:59.404
You're the first person
I'm talking to about it.

51:01.145 --> 51:03.016
RECEPTIONIST: That's okay.

51:03.147 --> 51:04.452
Do you have
any questions, Misha?

51:07.020 --> 51:07.934
MISHA:
How long will it take?

51:10.241 --> 51:11.677
RECEPTIONIST:
Well, the procedure itself

51:11.807 --> 51:14.375
is only about
five minutes or so,

51:14.506 --> 51:16.812
but be prepared to spend
two to three hours

51:16.943 --> 51:18.075
for your entire appointment.

51:20.555 --> 51:22.296
MISHA:
And how much is it?

51:22.427 --> 51:24.037
RECEPTIONIST:
The procedure costs $500

51:24.168 --> 51:25.473
with applicable taxes.

51:25.604 --> 51:28.998
We take all kinds of
payment options except check.

51:32.567 --> 51:34.395
Okay?

51:34.526 --> 51:36.049
- Okay.

51:36.180 --> 51:37.442
RECEPTIONIST: We've got you
scheduled for Saturday.

51:37.572 --> 51:39.183
- Yeah, thank you.

51:39.313 --> 51:40.532
RECEPTIONIST: And don't forget
to bring somebody with you

51:40.662 --> 51:42.099
so you have
a safe ride home.

51:44.057 --> 51:45.493
- Okay.

51:45.624 --> 51:46.755
RECEPTIONIST: Okay, thanks
for calling Dr. Morgan.

52:02.815 --> 52:05.078
[sighs]

52:05.209 --> 52:06.471
MISHA: Hey, can I get
a ticket to Edmonton

52:06.601 --> 52:07.863
for Saturday, please?

52:07.994 --> 52:09.082
TICKET AGENT: Yup.

52:09.213 --> 52:10.692
[computer keys clicking]

52:10.823 --> 52:13.782
What time, 6:00 AM,
12:00 PM, or 3:00 PM?

52:13.913 --> 52:15.654
- Six, please.

52:15.784 --> 52:17.090

52:17.221 --> 52:18.047

52:40.853 --> 52:42.159

52:47.120 --> 52:49.949
[keys beeping]

52:50.079 --> 52:52.517
[long beep]

52:52.647 --> 52:54.040
Shit! Uh...

52:55.998 --> 52:58.436
TICKET AGENT:
It says insufficient funds.

52:58.566 --> 53:00.177
Well, you don't have
to pay now.

53:00.307 --> 53:03.136
We have your name, so if you
just come back on the day,

53:03.267 --> 53:04.746
we'll hold your reservation
for you.

53:04.877 --> 53:05.791
- Um...

53:07.314 --> 53:08.141
TICKET AGENT:
I can hold it.

53:08.272 --> 53:09.403
- Yeah, so I can just,

53:09.534 --> 53:12.058
I can just come back
the morning of and pay?

53:12.189 --> 53:13.799
TICKET AGENT:
Yeah, absolutely.

53:13.929 --> 53:16.280
I have your name,
Patton, so.

53:16.410 --> 53:17.411
No problem.

53:17.542 --> 53:19.587
- Okay, cool.
So that's it?

53:19.718 --> 53:20.675
TICKET AGENT: Yup.

53:20.806 --> 53:22.286
- Thanks.
TICKET AGENT: See you.

53:22.416 --> 53:25.419
[phone ringing]

53:35.124 --> 53:36.256
- [on phone]: Hey!

53:36.387 --> 53:37.692
MISHA'S MOM [on phone]:
Hey, Mish.

53:37.823 --> 53:40.608
Sorry we haven't checked in
for a couple of days.

53:40.739 --> 53:42.741
- It's fine,
how's it going down there?

53:42.871 --> 53:44.612
MISHA'S MOM:
It's good.

53:44.743 --> 53:46.788
Dad went golfing today.

53:46.919 --> 53:49.574
I went to the spa.
It was so nice.

53:49.704 --> 53:52.403
- [chuckles]
Nice.

53:52.533 --> 53:54.143
MISHA'S MOM: I don't think
your father wants to leave.

53:55.928 --> 53:57.582
How's work going?

53:57.712 --> 53:59.236
- Uh, same old.

54:01.325 --> 54:04.284
MISHA'S MOM:
Okay, well, uh...

54:04.415 --> 54:07.156
there's not much else
to report on this end.

54:07.287 --> 54:08.332
I just wanted to
call and check in.

54:08.462 --> 54:10.377
- Mom?

54:10.508 --> 54:12.988
MISHA'S MOM: I love you,
we'll see you soon.

54:13.119 --> 54:14.033
- Mom?

54:15.382 --> 54:16.427
MISHA'S MOM: What?

54:18.516 --> 54:21.867
- Can you please transfer
some money into my account.

54:21.997 --> 54:23.085
I need some.

54:23.216 --> 54:24.826
[Mother sighs]

54:24.957 --> 54:26.045
MISHA'S MOM: I told you
not to be spending

54:26.175 --> 54:28.526
all your money on eating out.

54:28.656 --> 54:30.049
There's enough food
in the fridge,

54:30.179 --> 54:31.180
you don't have to be
going out every night to eat.

54:31.311 --> 54:34.575
- Nah, I wasn't,
just like for gas and stuff.

54:36.142 --> 54:37.752
MISHA'S MOM: I don't know.

54:37.883 --> 54:40.146
You can take the bus if you
need to get around, you know.

54:40.277 --> 54:42.496
Maybe one of your friends
can drive you around

54:42.627 --> 54:45.760
instead of you driving them
around all the time.

54:45.891 --> 54:47.284
Have you ever thought about
asking them for gas money

54:47.414 --> 54:48.763
once in a while?

54:48.894 --> 54:50.896
- Whatever,
I fucking worked for it, okay.

54:51.026 --> 54:52.071
If I wanna spend it
on whatever I want,

54:52.201 --> 54:53.159
I should be able to.

54:53.290 --> 54:55.379
I'm not a fucking child
anymore.

54:55.509 --> 54:57.816
MISHA'S MOM: Mish, no.
I'm not putting anymore money...

55:05.824 --> 55:07.347
[sighs]

55:25.974 --> 55:27.802
[indistinct chatter]

55:45.429 --> 55:46.908
- Misha?

55:47.039 --> 55:49.781
- Hey, you mind if I sit?

55:52.087 --> 55:53.393
- Please.

55:55.874 --> 55:59.181
- So, I know things
have been ridiculous

55:59.312 --> 56:02.054
the past few days,
er, the other day,

56:02.184 --> 56:06.493
and I just want you to know
that I think I made my decision

56:06.624 --> 56:07.799
on the review and...

56:07.929 --> 56:09.366
- Sorry, Mish.

56:09.496 --> 56:10.758
But you have to understand.

56:10.889 --> 56:12.717
I mean, I gave you two options,
staying or going,

56:12.847 --> 56:13.979
and you walked
right out of here.

56:15.546 --> 56:16.590
I haven't even heard
from you since;

56:16.721 --> 56:20.202
so I assumed you were done.

56:20.333 --> 56:23.075
- I do understand
that I overreacted,

56:23.205 --> 56:25.947
and it was childish.

56:26.078 --> 56:29.168
- Okay, how about this?

56:29.298 --> 56:30.778
Come back
at the end of the summer,

56:30.909 --> 56:33.477
and we'll see if we have
something for you.

56:39.787 --> 56:40.962
- Thanks, Aubrey.

58:26.851 --> 58:28.592
- Hey.

58:28.722 --> 58:29.593
- Yeah.

58:30.811 --> 58:31.943
- Come check this out.

58:38.602 --> 58:39.951
- What's this?

58:40.081 --> 58:41.953
- I think we got the next
two spots we're gonna hit.

58:42.083 --> 58:44.259
LOUIS: Yeah?
FELIX: Yeah.

58:44.390 --> 58:46.523
We'll have to
scope it out first but...

58:46.653 --> 58:48.176
LOUIS: I'm gonna get water,
you want something?

58:48.307 --> 58:49.700
- Nah, I'm good.

58:49.830 --> 58:52.529
- Yeah, uh-huh, no,
of course he can come today.

58:54.922 --> 58:56.794
Are you sure you don't have
something for both my boys?

58:59.231 --> 59:00.711
I understand.

59:00.841 --> 59:02.451
Alright, I'll let him know.

59:02.582 --> 59:04.279
Thank you.

59:04.410 --> 59:06.194
- Who's that?

59:06.325 --> 59:08.501
- Where's Felix?

59:08.632 --> 59:10.372
- He's in the room.

59:10.503 --> 59:12.766
PAULINE:
Job interview today.

59:12.897 --> 59:16.378
But she only has one spot,
it's yours if you want it.

59:16.509 --> 59:19.643
Hard physical labor but the pay
is really, really good.

59:19.773 --> 59:20.731
You think you can handle it?

59:21.993 --> 59:22.863
- Yeah.

59:25.344 --> 59:27.433
- We just keep this
between you and me?

59:27.564 --> 59:28.782
I know you won't fuck it up.

59:36.224 --> 59:37.356
Go get ready and get outside.

59:37.486 --> 59:38.836
It's too nice
to be indoors all day.

59:54.373 --> 59:55.243
- Where's your water?

59:59.552 --> 01:00:01.380
Hey, where's your water?

01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:02.381
- In my stomach.

01:00:16.917 --> 01:00:18.049
FELIX: So, what do you figure,

01:00:18.179 --> 01:00:19.398
we'll check out
the store tonight, or what?

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:23.445
- Tomorrow.

01:00:23.576 --> 01:00:24.446
- Why not today?

01:00:28.407 --> 01:00:29.713
What?
LOUIS: Nothing.

01:00:29.843 --> 01:00:31.279
Mom just told me about
this interview this morning.

01:00:31.410 --> 01:00:32.585
- So?

01:00:32.716 --> 01:00:34.282
- So apparently,
it's a sure thing.

01:00:34.413 --> 01:00:36.415
She's got a friend
who can help us out.

01:00:36.545 --> 01:00:38.112
- I don't care.
- Listen, man.

01:00:38.243 --> 01:00:39.897
I think you should
seriously think about it.

01:00:40.027 --> 01:00:41.115
- Dude, we have
a fool-fucking-proof way

01:00:41.246 --> 01:00:43.030
of making cash.
- For how long?

01:00:43.161 --> 01:00:45.337
You can't honestly think this is
a long-term solution, huh?

01:00:45.467 --> 01:00:47.034
And if you do, fuck,
you're dumber than I thought.

01:00:47.165 --> 01:00:49.254
- For as long as we want,
Dickinsfield,

01:00:49.384 --> 01:00:50.995
Timberlea, Thickwood,
untouched!

01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:53.519
- Let me make you a deal.

01:00:55.303 --> 01:00:57.915
We'll do one more, you can pick
whichever one you want,

01:00:58.045 --> 01:00:59.525
you can even keep my half.

01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:02.136
Just go to the interview.

01:01:04.617 --> 01:01:06.010
One more, that's it!
I'm getting a job,

01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:08.534
and when I do, I'm done.

01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:11.668
FELIX: Who the fuck
do you think you are, dude?

01:01:11.798 --> 01:01:13.147
Look at you, man,
look at yourself.

01:01:14.714 --> 01:01:16.150
You and me aren't big enough
to do anything with our lives,

01:01:16.281 --> 01:01:17.891
we're not going to do shit.

01:01:18.022 --> 01:01:19.110
This is what we do, man.

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:20.938
You're a fucking scumbag,
just like me.

01:01:25.986 --> 01:01:27.422
- One more.

01:01:27.553 --> 01:01:28.423
I promise.

01:01:30.034 --> 01:01:31.644
Just go to the fucking thing,
okay.

01:01:36.823 --> 01:01:37.737
- Okay.

01:01:51.142 --> 01:01:52.186

01:01:59.846 --> 01:02:01.239
[chuckles]

01:02:05.373 --> 01:02:06.374
- Can I ask you a favor?

01:02:08.289 --> 01:02:09.160
- Obviously.

01:02:10.857 --> 01:02:11.728
- Can I borrow money?

01:02:13.904 --> 01:02:15.775
I just need some to tide me over
until my folks get back

01:02:15.906 --> 01:02:17.168
and our check gets in.
- Of course.

01:02:20.084 --> 01:02:21.738
- Are you sure?

01:02:21.868 --> 01:02:23.000
- Yeah.

01:02:28.092 --> 01:02:30.181
- I-I need it today, though.

01:02:33.010 --> 01:02:33.837
- That's fine.

01:02:35.012 --> 01:02:35.882
Don't worry.

01:02:39.668 --> 01:02:40.582
- Thanks.

01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:53.857
- It's fine.

01:02:55.206 --> 01:02:56.076
- Thank you.

01:02:59.471 --> 01:03:00.472
I gotta get some gas.

01:03:10.699 --> 01:03:13.615

what's good, man?

01:03:13.746 --> 01:03:14.616
LOUIS: This is it.

01:03:14.747 --> 01:03:15.617
- Cool, cool.

01:03:20.405 --> 01:03:21.406
Where's the bro?

01:03:21.536 --> 01:03:22.407
- Job interview.

01:03:23.495 --> 01:03:25.453
[laughs]

01:03:25.584 --> 01:03:27.238
- Him? Christ!

01:03:27.368 --> 01:03:29.544
You gotta be pretty desperate
to pay him to work for you.

01:03:29.675 --> 01:03:30.763
- Hey, easy.

01:03:30.894 --> 01:03:31.808
- What?

01:03:33.461 --> 01:03:35.768
Oh, little bro is growing up!

01:03:35.899 --> 01:03:37.335
- Shut up, alright?

01:03:37.465 --> 01:03:39.424
KEVIN: Pierce, you deaf?

01:03:39.554 --> 01:03:41.252
What's up, Louis?
- Not much. What's up, Kev?

01:03:41.382 --> 01:03:42.209
- Give us a hand?

01:03:43.471 --> 01:03:45.343
- Yeah, sure.
- Alright, come on.

01:03:50.435 --> 01:03:51.392

01:03:52.654 --> 01:03:54.395

01:03:54.526 --> 01:03:55.527
Over here?
PIERCE: Yeah.

01:03:55.657 --> 01:03:56.571
KEVIN:
Yeah, right here is good.

01:04:09.367 --> 01:04:10.150
- That it?
PIERCE: Yeah.

01:04:13.937 --> 01:04:15.721
- Thanks, Louis.
LOUIS: Yeah, man, anytime.

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:16.722
- Alright, thanks.

01:04:18.942 --> 01:04:19.768
- Hey man,
I'm just chillin' out

01:04:19.899 --> 01:04:21.118
if you need help with anything.

01:04:21.248 --> 01:04:24.556
- Uhhh, yeah, man,
actually, like these here.

01:04:24.686 --> 01:04:27.080
So I kinda need you to
just reorganize them by size.

01:04:27.211 --> 01:04:28.038
- I got it, I got it.
- You got it?

01:04:28.168 --> 01:04:29.778
Nice, I-I'll be back in a bit.

01:04:29.909 --> 01:04:30.779

[clears throat]

01:04:57.981 --> 01:04:59.678
As I understand,
it was your mother

01:04:59.808 --> 01:05:01.854
who put you in contact
with this position.

01:05:01.985 --> 01:05:02.942
- Yeah.

01:05:03.073 --> 01:05:04.204
- I don't know if you know,

01:05:04.335 --> 01:05:07.120
but your father and I
used to work together.

01:05:07.251 --> 01:05:09.644
- Cool,
I didn't know that.

01:05:09.775 --> 01:05:11.342
- Yeah!

01:05:11.472 --> 01:05:15.650
Anyways, you're interested
in some warehouse work.

01:05:15.781 --> 01:05:16.913
- Yup.

01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:20.133
- Oh, this might be
a silly question,

01:05:20.264 --> 01:05:22.527
but do you have
any certifications,

01:05:22.657 --> 01:05:24.964
forklift, anything like that?

01:05:25.095 --> 01:05:26.792
- Nah.
RHONDA: It's not a problem.

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:28.925
We provide extensive training.

01:05:30.448 --> 01:05:32.711
Have you had
any previous experience

01:05:32.841 --> 01:05:34.234
in a warehouse setting?

01:05:34.365 --> 01:05:35.844
- Nope.

01:05:35.975 --> 01:05:36.889
- Okay.

01:05:41.111 --> 01:05:43.765
Uh, is everything okay?

01:05:43.896 --> 01:05:47.204
- Yeah, it's just my elbow
is bothering me.

01:05:47.334 --> 01:05:50.947
- Oh. Oh, yeah,
just try to ignore that.

01:05:51.077 --> 01:05:52.296
- Okay.

01:05:52.426 --> 01:05:56.169
- Uh, do you have
any restrictions with time,

01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:59.912
days you cannot work,
time shifts, things like that?

01:06:00.043 --> 01:06:02.393
- No, I'm pretty much available
whenever.

01:06:02.523 --> 01:06:04.090
- Great. Okay.

01:06:06.658 --> 01:06:07.441
- Do you have a bathroom?

01:06:09.008 --> 01:06:12.664
- Uh, yeah,
it's down the hall.

01:06:12.794 --> 01:06:14.274
- Do you mind if I--?

01:06:14.405 --> 01:06:15.319

01:06:17.016 --> 01:06:18.539

Join the ranks of
the working class yet, or what?

- Hey, just relax, man.
- Fuck you too, punk.

01:12:54.195 --> 01:12:55.109
She needs to hear this.

01:13:02.421 --> 01:13:03.335
FELIX:
You're a terrible mother.

01:13:07.339 --> 01:13:09.254
You're a terrible mother,
I fucking hate you.

01:13:10.647 --> 01:13:11.952
I fucking hate you.

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:15.565
- Mom. Mom, hey!
Mom, mom.

01:13:15.695 --> 01:13:16.566
Mom!
- No.

01:13:16.696 --> 01:13:19.569
- Stop, stop, just stop.

01:13:21.179 --> 01:13:23.529
PAULINE: You have one week
to find a job.

01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:26.402
One week,
or you are out on your asses.

01:13:28.795 --> 01:13:29.927
Pick this shit up!

- So, how do I look?

01:14:20.107 --> 01:14:21.065
Would you fuck me?

01:14:24.198 --> 01:14:26.331
- Yeah, it's fine.
- [laughs]

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:27.898
MISHA: We can go to your house,
if you want to get a change?

01:14:28.028 --> 01:14:29.203

You think Devin's
going to be there, tonight?

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:43.304
- Probably,
maybe with Laura.

01:14:44.654 --> 01:14:45.524
- Maybe.

01:14:51.182 --> 01:14:52.749
- How was it, anyway?

01:14:59.103 --> 01:15:00.757
- It was okay.

01:15:00.887 --> 01:15:02.933
I-I can see
why she's with him.

01:15:06.284 --> 01:15:08.329

fucking guys with girls.

01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:09.853
- [laughs] Have you seen her?

01:15:09.983 --> 01:15:10.941
MISHA: Have you seen him?

Don't worry, I'm safe.

01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:20.777
MISHA: Whatever.

01:15:22.561 --> 01:15:23.997
I gotta get in the shower.

01:17:26.119 --> 01:17:27.599
- Yeah, you and everyone else.

01:17:31.559 --> 01:17:32.560
- Do you ever think
you'll leave?

01:17:34.911 --> 01:17:36.086
- No.

01:17:36.216 --> 01:17:37.000
If we're going to
have it good anywhere,

01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:38.131
it's going to be here.

01:17:39.567 --> 01:17:41.787
- I just don't get it,
you know?

01:17:41.918 --> 01:17:43.354
We're the same,
but I'm a fuck-up.

01:17:43.484 --> 01:17:44.834
How do you do it?

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:51.318
- Listen, man, don't let
that shit bother you, alright?

01:17:53.059 --> 01:17:55.801
Just have a good time tonight,
let the night go as is,

01:17:55.932 --> 01:17:56.802
and you'll have a clearer head
in the morning.

01:18:02.852 --> 01:18:03.722
Grab one.

01:18:04.941 --> 01:18:05.724
Grab one for me too.

01:18:18.955 --> 01:18:19.825
Better?

01:18:20.957 --> 01:18:21.827
- Yeah.

01:18:26.484 --> 01:18:28.007
Hope there's no weird kids
hanging out tonight.

01:18:28.138 --> 01:18:29.617
[chuckles]

01:18:29.748 --> 01:18:31.663
- You know, we used to be
those weird kids, remember?

01:18:31.794 --> 01:18:33.796
- Yeah, it was weird
as hell, back then.

01:18:33.926 --> 01:18:35.711
Man, remember
how fucked up that was?

01:18:35.841 --> 01:18:37.147
Being 14, 15,

01:18:37.277 --> 01:18:38.539
hanging out with
a bunch of guys in their 20s,

01:18:38.670 --> 01:18:40.454
doing all kinds of crazy shit.

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:42.761
- Remember when Alexa
fucked that dude

01:18:42.892 --> 01:18:44.415
that was like 24 or something.

01:18:44.545 --> 01:18:46.722
- That's exactly what
I'm talking about, exactly.

01:18:46.852 --> 01:18:47.940
- As if you wouldn't have
fucked her.

01:18:48.071 --> 01:18:49.202
- Yeah, I probably
would fuck her,

01:18:49.333 --> 01:18:50.769
but not if she was seven years
younger than me.

01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:52.336
Man, that's fucked up,
even for me.

01:18:52.466 --> 01:18:55.121

take it easy, Casanova.

You gonna be good?

Thanks.

- Uh, that was Kev.

He wants me to work
early in the morning, so...

01:20:30.956 --> 01:20:33.045
- So.

01:20:33.176 --> 01:20:33.959
- I'm just gonna go home.

01:20:35.134 --> 01:20:35.961
- What about tonight?

01:20:38.529 --> 01:20:39.835
- Go to the party,
have fun, you know,

01:20:39.965 --> 01:20:41.358
it'll be good for you.

01:20:41.488 --> 01:20:43.534
- No, I mean, the store.

01:20:43.664 --> 01:20:44.622
- What about the store?

01:20:49.409 --> 01:20:50.541
- You're not going to
help me, are you?

01:20:56.025 --> 01:20:58.375
- Look, if things go good
with Kev, I don't know,

01:20:58.505 --> 01:20:59.332
maybe, I can help you
get in there, alright?

01:20:59.463 --> 01:21:00.464
- No, no.
- Could be good for us, right?

01:21:00.594 --> 01:21:02.596
- Nah, man, no.

01:21:02.727 --> 01:21:04.990
I'm not doing that shit.
I'm not your sidekick.

01:21:05.121 --> 01:21:06.339
Come on.

01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:07.863
- Well, I can't stop my life
every time you want to--

01:21:07.993 --> 01:21:09.342
- Stop your life?

01:21:09.473 --> 01:21:11.518
What life? Fuck!

01:21:11.649 --> 01:21:12.650
Some life.

01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:15.958
Fuck.

01:21:17.481 --> 01:21:20.092
Listen, you promised me
that you were gonna do this.

01:21:20.223 --> 01:21:21.441
When you promise somebody
you're gonna do something,

01:21:21.572 --> 01:21:22.573
you do it.

01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:24.575

if you went to that thing--

01:21:24.705 --> 01:21:25.532
- I went.
- Come on, man.

01:21:25.663 --> 01:21:26.620
- I went.
- Come on.

- I went, come on,
I went, I did.

01:21:30.102 --> 01:21:31.538
Come on, man,
you're my fucking brother.

01:21:33.323 --> 01:21:34.150
You're supposed to
have my back, man,

01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:35.194
that's how it's always been.

01:21:35.325 --> 01:21:36.630
I have your back,
you have my back.

nobody expects you to do,

01:21:42.288 --> 01:21:43.246
you'll find out
it's not so bad on this side.

01:21:43.376 --> 01:21:44.247

I don't give a fuck what you do.

I don't.

01:21:56.389 --> 01:21:57.564

Get in.

01:23:42.887 --> 01:23:44.845
- [on radio] 97.9 FM,
Fort McMurray,

01:23:44.976 --> 01:23:46.717
here's what's making news
this hour.

01:23:46.847 --> 01:23:47.935
At least one man is dead

01:23:48.066 --> 01:23:49.459
and another
airlifted to Edmonton

01:23:49.589 --> 01:23:52.331
following an accident
on Highway 63.

01:23:52.462 --> 01:23:54.290
Witnesses say one car
crossed the center line

01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:56.596
and ran head-on
into an oncoming bus

01:23:56.727 --> 01:23:58.381
killing the driver instantly.

01:23:58.511 --> 01:24:00.992
The driver was 31 years old.

01:24:01.123 --> 01:24:03.081
In other news, there has been
a temporary fire ban

01:24:03.212 --> 01:24:04.648
in the region with
dry conditions getting worse...

01:24:04.778 --> 01:24:06.389
- Thirty-one?

01:24:06.519 --> 01:24:07.781
That isn't a bad age to die.

01:24:09.261 --> 01:24:10.741
- That's so young.

01:24:10.871 --> 01:24:11.829
MISHA:
Don't be an asshole,

01:24:11.959 --> 01:24:13.744
the guy could've had
a family or something.

01:24:13.874 --> 01:24:15.876
Thirty-one is young, dude.

01:24:16.007 --> 01:24:17.530
- Way too fucking young.

01:24:17.661 --> 01:24:19.967
- Man, look it isn't
that young if you have a plan,

01:24:20.098 --> 01:24:22.361
like, I don't
want to live forever,

01:24:22.492 --> 01:24:24.276
I've already peaked.

01:24:24.407 --> 01:24:26.496
I mean, I could go tomorrow
and be a happy camper.

01:24:27.975 --> 01:24:28.802
DEVIN:
That's fucked up.

01:24:28.933 --> 01:24:30.195
[Alexa laughs]

01:24:30.326 --> 01:24:32.676
PIERCE: I've just done
the things I want to do.

01:24:32.806 --> 01:24:35.983
- What about a house,
a family and any of that shit?

01:24:36.114 --> 01:24:39.161
PIERCE: No, man,
I'm not interested.

01:24:39.291 --> 01:24:41.467
I mean, I probably would have,
but what's the point?

01:24:41.598 --> 01:24:43.121
Like, buy a million-dollar house

01:24:43.252 --> 01:24:44.905
and spend the rest of my life
paying it off?

01:24:45.036 --> 01:24:47.560
Like, stuck in one spot,
seeing the same people.

01:24:47.691 --> 01:24:50.955
- Um, I wanna die
when I'm really old.

01:24:52.739 --> 01:24:54.306
MISHA:
I wanna be a hundred.

01:24:54.437 --> 01:24:55.916
- Okay, that's way too old.

01:24:56.047 --> 01:24:57.483
- Seventy-five is a good age.

01:24:57.614 --> 01:24:59.137
ALEXA: Yeah, that's cool,
I can get on board with that.

01:24:59.268 --> 01:25:00.486
- No!

01:25:00.617 --> 01:25:01.705
I'm sticking to my guns
on this one;

01:25:01.835 --> 01:25:05.361
30, ideally, in a plane crash.

01:25:05.491 --> 01:25:07.928
[chuckles]

01:25:08.059 --> 01:25:09.887
I mean, if not in a plane crash,
then natural causes,

01:25:10.017 --> 01:25:11.715
and if I couldn't
get either of those,

01:25:11.845 --> 01:25:13.630
then, I don't know.

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:15.022
If you don't hear from me
in a little while,

01:25:15.153 --> 01:25:16.676
you could probably guess
what happened.

01:25:18.287 --> 01:25:20.202
I mean, I-I'll just take off
somewhere foreign,

01:25:20.332 --> 01:25:21.246
wouldn't tell anyone
where I was going,

01:25:21.377 --> 01:25:22.334
and I would just say
a quick goodbye

01:25:22.465 --> 01:25:23.379
to everybody in a message.

01:25:24.945 --> 01:25:27.296
- But what if your life
turns around and you're happy?

01:25:28.601 --> 01:25:31.561
PIERCE: Uh... I am happy.

01:25:31.691 --> 01:25:33.171
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:25:33.302 --> 01:25:35.913
Look, my time will come
where it'll be enough for me.

01:25:36.043 --> 01:25:38.437
It'll happen to you, I hope.

01:25:38.568 --> 01:25:41.005
Like, where I'm just ready
to say goodbye,

01:25:41.136 --> 01:25:44.574
and just not live anymore.

01:25:45.923 --> 01:25:49.100
Look, I just look
into the future and...

01:25:49.231 --> 01:25:51.320
I don't see myself in it.

01:25:55.715 --> 01:25:57.978
Like, once you get through
the pool of what's left,

01:25:58.109 --> 01:26:00.677
you get comfortable
and you just settle in

01:26:00.807 --> 01:26:03.419
to the same boring life.

01:26:08.728 --> 01:26:09.642
- Yeah.

01:26:19.261 --> 01:26:20.610
- Can you, just like,
let me off here?

01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:22.873
I gotta pick some shit up
from work.

01:26:23.003 --> 01:26:24.004
MISHA: Are you sure?

01:26:24.135 --> 01:26:26.703
I mean...
Do you want us to wait?

01:26:26.833 --> 01:26:28.183
PIERCE: No.
- No.

01:26:28.313 --> 01:26:31.316
- Nah, it's okay,
it's just a short walk.

01:26:31.447 --> 01:26:32.752
MISHA: Okay.

01:26:32.883 --> 01:26:34.537
DEVIN: Alright, buddy.

01:26:34.667 --> 01:26:35.494
PIERCE: Alright.

01:26:36.974 --> 01:26:38.149
ALEXA: Later, dude.

01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:40.804
- Bye, guys,
thanks for the ride, Mish.

01:26:40.934 --> 01:26:42.806
MISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah,
no problem, man. Be safe!

01:26:42.936 --> 01:26:44.111
DEVIN: Later, buddy.

01:26:48.159 --> 01:26:49.552
- What the fuck?

01:26:49.682 --> 01:26:51.641
- Fuck, that was depressing.

01:26:51.771 --> 01:26:52.859
MISHA:
Devin, you're up next.

01:27:02.217 --> 01:27:03.087
Yeah, no problem.

01:27:16.753 --> 01:27:18.929
- I'm sorry,
but I can't help it.

01:27:19.059 --> 01:27:20.844
- What about
what we talked about earlier?

01:27:22.976 --> 01:27:24.804
- Right, um.

01:27:27.242 --> 01:27:30.636
That is the last of my cash.

01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:36.338
- I need more than this, Lex.

01:27:36.468 --> 01:27:38.340
- That's all I have on me.

01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:40.733
Look, come get me tomorrow,
and I'll give you the rest,

01:27:40.864 --> 01:27:43.954
but that's it, okay?

01:27:44.084 --> 01:27:45.695
Bye.

01:27:45.825 --> 01:27:46.913
[car door slams]

01:28:00.536 --> 01:28:01.711
- Are you gonna come
sit up front?

01:28:05.192 --> 01:28:08.108
[clattering]

01:28:25.778 --> 01:28:26.866
[sighs]

01:29:15.611 --> 01:29:16.568
- Can I ask you something?

01:29:19.136 --> 01:29:20.180
MISHA: Of course.

01:29:21.573 --> 01:29:23.836
- What's the difference
between me and him?

01:29:23.967 --> 01:29:25.098
MISHA: Who?

01:29:25.229 --> 01:29:26.143
- Louis.

01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:29.799
- I don't know.
- I'm serious.

01:29:29.929 --> 01:29:30.974
Off the top of your head,
when you think of him,

01:29:31.104 --> 01:29:32.976
and you think of me,
what's the difference?

01:29:33.106 --> 01:29:34.281
MISHA: I don't know.

01:29:34.412 --> 01:29:37.197
- You do know,
just want you to lay it on me.

01:29:37.328 --> 01:29:38.808
It's not a big deal.

01:29:38.938 --> 01:29:40.766
- I guess there's not
that much that's different.

01:29:44.683 --> 01:29:46.990
When you two are together,
you're practically identical.

01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:50.907
But when you're on your own,
you're that same person,

01:29:52.909 --> 01:29:54.389
and Louis is different.

01:29:57.087 --> 01:29:58.175
- Yeah, I can see that.

01:30:02.309 --> 01:30:03.659
- What do you think
the difference is?

01:30:06.444 --> 01:30:07.358
- I don't.

01:30:07.489 --> 01:30:09.186
I just think we're the same.

01:30:09.316 --> 01:30:10.405
Always been the same.

01:30:15.758 --> 01:30:16.672
So, what do you need money for?

01:30:16.802 --> 01:30:18.021
MISHA:
That's a loaded question.

01:30:22.808 --> 01:30:24.157
- I could give you some
if you need.

01:30:26.812 --> 01:30:28.161
I'm serious,
how much you need?

01:30:29.989 --> 01:30:31.643
- Everybody could always use
more money.

01:30:31.774 --> 01:30:33.123
FELIX: Yeah,
but you sounded desperate,

01:30:33.253 --> 01:30:35.299
like you needed it quick.

01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:36.866
MISHA: Look, don't take this
the wrong way,

01:30:36.996 --> 01:30:38.607
but I don't wanna
owe anybody anything.

01:30:39.912 --> 01:30:41.784
Especially you.

01:30:41.914 --> 01:30:43.438
- Just consider it a gift.

01:30:43.568 --> 01:30:46.353
Think of it as me doing what
no one is expecting me to do.

01:30:47.877 --> 01:30:49.226
[thunder rumbles]

01:30:51.881 --> 01:30:54.318
- My problems would be solved
with like 400 bucks.

01:30:55.885 --> 01:30:57.713
FELIX: Okay.

01:30:57.843 --> 01:31:00.150
So, I'm going to
have to ask you.

01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:01.456
- I'm not telling you what for.

01:31:03.545 --> 01:31:05.547
- I wanna know, why me?
Why not Louis?

01:31:07.984 --> 01:31:09.464
- I can't ask him for it.

01:31:10.987 --> 01:31:13.076
I don't expect you
to understand why,

01:31:13.206 --> 01:31:14.338
I just can't.

01:31:16.906 --> 01:31:18.951
Right now, you're
the last option I have.

01:31:20.692 --> 01:31:21.737
FELIX: Okay.

01:31:24.391 --> 01:31:25.480
Okay.

01:31:30.397 --> 01:31:31.486
MISHA: Okay.

01:31:36.621 --> 01:31:37.796
I'm pregnant.

01:31:37.927 --> 01:31:39.145
[thunder rumbles]

01:31:40.407 --> 01:31:41.583
And I don't want it.

01:31:46.805 --> 01:31:47.763
Is this the part
where you tell me

01:31:47.893 --> 01:31:49.504
you lost respect for me
or something?

01:31:49.634 --> 01:31:50.592
FELIX: Hmm.

01:31:53.246 --> 01:31:54.378
No.

01:31:56.467 --> 01:31:57.642
You didn't have to
tell me that.

01:32:05.128 --> 01:32:08.348
- I guess I just needed to
say it out loud or something.

01:32:09.741 --> 01:32:11.482
FELIX: Oh, well.

01:32:11.613 --> 01:32:12.788
I don't really care.

01:32:12.918 --> 01:32:14.616
It's not my life,
it's yours.

01:32:22.058 --> 01:32:23.102
- Okay.

01:32:41.947 --> 01:32:43.470
[car engine stops]

01:32:53.655 --> 01:32:55.004
- Take your jacket off.

01:33:01.184 --> 01:33:02.359
- I'm not fucking you.

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:06.885
- Take your jacket off.

01:33:10.933 --> 01:33:12.325
Take your jacket off.

01:33:16.852 --> 01:33:18.114
I'm serious.

01:33:23.423 --> 01:33:24.816
[sighs]

01:33:31.823 --> 01:33:33.259
You know, this money
means nothing to me

01:33:33.390 --> 01:33:34.783
whether I have it or not.

01:33:39.962 --> 01:33:41.790
My life doesn't change one bit.

01:33:46.055 --> 01:33:47.709
I'm still just gonna be
a piece of shit.

01:33:56.631 --> 01:33:59.372
Just lean back into the seat,
into the door.

01:33:59.503 --> 01:34:00.460

01:34:11.994 --> 01:34:13.648

01:34:17.564 --> 01:34:18.653
[whimpers]

01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:23.483
Pull your pants down
a little bit.

01:34:41.197 --> 01:34:42.894
I think my brother loves you.

01:34:45.157 --> 01:34:46.506
[moans]

01:34:48.813 --> 01:34:50.989
I see the way
that my brother looks at you...

01:34:57.604 --> 01:34:58.649
when we all hang out.

01:35:03.001 --> 01:35:04.437
And the way
that you look at him.

01:35:10.792 --> 01:35:12.358
Look at me
the way you look at him.

01:35:12.489 --> 01:35:13.838
- No!

01:35:17.276 --> 01:35:18.451
- Look at me
the way you look at him.

01:35:20.105 --> 01:35:21.846
[sobs]

01:35:21.977 --> 01:35:23.065
Please.

Okay, go.

01:37:25.361 --> 01:37:26.710
- What do you mean?
Where's the money?

01:37:28.538 --> 01:37:29.669
- We gotta go get it.

01:37:31.106 --> 01:37:32.455
- But you said you had it.

01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:36.154
- Drive.

When we go in there...

01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:49.602
don't say anything.

01:37:49.733 --> 01:37:51.735
Don't even look at them, okay?

01:37:57.088 --> 01:37:58.568
We can get what we need
and get out.

01:37:59.656 --> 01:38:01.527
I need you.

01:38:01.658 --> 01:38:04.226
And you need me, okay?
It's just us.

who my brother is?

01:41:04.884 --> 01:41:05.972
What do you want?

Come on, man.

Come on, put that back.
