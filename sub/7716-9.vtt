WEBVTT

00:03.380 --> 00:04.923
Oops. A little help.

00:07.884 --> 00:10.011
Wow, your hair
is really thinning.

00:10.804 --> 00:14.015
Standing is proven to be
healthier, increases productivity

00:14.099 --> 00:15.392
and just looks cooler.

00:16.101 --> 00:18.269
Picture someone
doing something heroic.

00:18.353 --> 00:20.605
Now, was he sitting
or standing?

00:21.564 --> 00:22.774
Not counting FDR.

00:23.400 --> 00:25.527
Every second you sit there
is an hour off your life.

00:25.610 --> 00:27.445
Look at all of you.

00:27.946 --> 00:29.572
I feel like you're
in a suicide cult.

00:29.698 --> 00:32.367
No,no,no. You're way
off on that one.

00:32.450 --> 00:34.494
Are you really
comfortable standing there?

00:34.577 --> 00:37.706
I tried one of those, and I just
couldn't find the sweet spot.

00:41.668 --> 00:44.671
Hey, guys, let's just all admit it, okay?
Dwight's better than us.

00:45.046 --> 00:47.090
He had the guts
to stop sitting,

00:47.173 --> 00:49.884
and he's never, ever gonna
go back on it, right?

00:50.301 --> 00:51.428
That's right, Jim.

01:01.646 --> 01:02.814
Hey, man.
Hey.

01:03.440 --> 01:04.941
Taking a
load off, huh?

01:05.066 --> 01:06.609
No. Putting a
load on, more like.

01:06.901 --> 01:07.986
Good luck with that.

01:08.153 --> 01:09.446
Last thing I need is luck.

01:15.827 --> 01:17.036
Thank you so much.

01:34.137 --> 01:35.722
What are you up to?
Oh, look out.

01:35.847 --> 01:36.890
Just... What are you doing?

01:37.015 --> 01:38.099
Think fast. Ha ha!

01:38.391 --> 01:40.185
Give that back. Come on. Prank!

01:41.352 --> 01:42.604
That's real creative.

01:42.687 --> 01:43.855
You know what, you're right.
It's not my best.

01:44.022 --> 01:45.148
'Cause you could
easily just bend over

01:45.231 --> 01:46.274
and pick that up,
right?

01:46.357 --> 01:48.234
I could. I just don't
feel like it, loser.

01:48.318 --> 01:49.444
Because you're sitting?
Standing.

01:49.527 --> 01:51.029
Okay.
Don't!

01:51.362 --> 01:52.697
Because you're sitting?
Standing.

01:53.281 --> 01:54.365
You know
I have to do this.

01:55.533 --> 01:56.493
I know.

01:56.576 --> 01:57.577
Whoa!

02:19.933 --> 02:23.895
Andrew Baines Bernard.

02:24.020 --> 02:25.814
I think you could
just do Andy Bernard.

02:25.897 --> 02:28.316
Andrew Baines Bernard.
I love filling

02:28.441 --> 02:30.902
these out 'cause it's like,
Oh, I'm taking a test,

02:30.985 --> 02:32.529
but I know the answers.

02:33.404 --> 02:37.283
In four seconds, my wife is going
to be coming through that door.

02:37.408 --> 02:38.493
I told her she
could work here.

02:38.576 --> 02:41.329
Under no circumstances
can that be allowed to happen.

02:43.373 --> 02:44.958
There you are, honey.

02:45.083 --> 02:47.126
How on earth did
you miss the elevator?

02:47.210 --> 02:48.169
What was that?

02:48.253 --> 02:49.671
I don't know.
He wasn't talking to me.

02:49.754 --> 02:52.257
But if I were you,
I wouldn't hire his wife.

02:53.591 --> 02:55.176
That's why my foundation,

02:55.260 --> 02:56.386
the Dream For
A Wish Foundation,

02:56.469 --> 02:57.637
is gonna put them
out of business.

02:57.762 --> 03:00.056
They're not gonna know what hit them.

03:00.139 --> 03:03.268
Everyone, I'd like
to introduce my wife,

03:03.351 --> 03:04.853
Mrs. Robert California.

03:04.936 --> 03:07.146
Mrs. California,
this is everyone.

03:07.272 --> 03:08.273
Hello.
Hi.

03:08.356 --> 03:10.358
Welcome.
Call me Susan, please.

03:10.441 --> 03:13.862
Last night at dinner,
Susan and I were talking

03:13.945 --> 03:15.488
about her returning
to work.

03:15.864 --> 03:19.200
So she's here today
to see if there's a good fit.

03:19.284 --> 03:21.661
Something tells me it
just might work out.

03:22.954 --> 03:25.874
This is Andy Bernard,
the regional manager.

03:25.957 --> 03:27.041
Hello. Nice to meet you.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.209
Hey there.
It's a pleasure. Welcome.

03:28.293 --> 03:29.294
Thank you.

03:29.377 --> 03:30.920
Andy, would you
be so kind

03:31.004 --> 03:32.714
as to show Susan
around the office,

03:32.797 --> 03:34.799
introduce her to
various departments,

03:35.300 --> 03:37.135
find a place
where she'll shine?

03:37.343 --> 03:40.054
I would love to,
but I have to be

03:40.138 --> 03:41.598
completely honest
with you guys.

03:42.265 --> 03:43.558
We're 100% staffed up.

03:46.227 --> 03:49.814
Andy, let's see if there's a
good fit first, then we'll talk.

03:53.943 --> 03:55.278
All right.

03:55.695 --> 03:57.572
Knock, knock, knock
Knock, knock, knock

03:57.697 --> 03:59.449
You don't have to say
it if you're doing it.

03:59.532 --> 04:01.576
Remember how you said

04:01.659 --> 04:03.912
that you were looking
for a place in the office

04:03.995 --> 04:06.331
to do calisthenics
and aerobics?

04:07.498 --> 04:09.000
Ah, weightlifting, yeah.

04:09.375 --> 04:10.418
Well, today's
your lucky day.

04:10.501 --> 04:12.712
I have opened,
in this very office building,

04:12.837 --> 04:15.089
Dwight Schrute's
Gym for Muscles.

04:15.340 --> 04:17.175
Want to take a look?
I'll take a look.

04:17.508 --> 04:21.179
Your path from
obesity begins right here.

04:23.014 --> 04:26.100
I've been meaning to join a gym.
For my health.

04:26.517 --> 04:29.520
<i>I used to say I wanted to live long
enough to see</i> a <i>black president</i>

04:29.646 --> 04:31.356
I didn't realize how
easy that would be.

04:31.522 --> 04:32.732
<i>So now I want to
live long enough</i>

04:32.815 --> 04:35.318
to see a really,
really gay president

04:35.485 --> 04:36.694
or a supermodel president.

04:37.278 --> 04:39.572
I want to see all the different
kinds of presidents.

04:40.114 --> 04:42.867
Obese people in my office building
are a drain on resources.

04:43.159 --> 04:44.577
Chairs wear out faster.

04:44.786 --> 04:46.537
It takes more freon
to keep them cool.

04:46.621 --> 04:48.206
They flush the
toilets more often.

04:48.289 --> 04:51.167
Plus, their massive BMs
bust the rivets on my pipes.

04:52.043 --> 04:56.214
But a gym turns
fat into cash.

04:57.256 --> 05:00.176
All right, the DM
Express is pulling out.

05:00.259 --> 05:01.886
All right, well, it was really
nice to meet you, Brian.

05:02.011 --> 05:03.137
Ah, it's actually Ryan.

05:03.221 --> 05:04.555
Oh, Ryan.
Yeah.

05:05.390 --> 05:06.557
Bitch.

05:07.225 --> 05:09.602
We will start
here at Erinville.

05:09.686 --> 05:10.687
Hi.

05:10.812 --> 05:12.230
Reception.

05:12.313 --> 05:13.940
Your classic
one-man operation.

05:14.065 --> 05:15.650
Although, I was
watching a movie,

05:15.775 --> 05:17.402
and Meryl Streep
had two secretaries.

05:17.485 --> 05:20.446
I was watching a movie, and a bunch
of apes took over San Francisco.

05:20.822 --> 05:21.823
Just saying.

05:21.906 --> 05:25.410
Two secretaries could convey
a sense of importance

05:25.576 --> 05:27.120
and success to our clients.

05:27.286 --> 05:30.623
Certainly worth exploring.
Wouldn't you agree, Andy?

05:31.582 --> 05:33.584
- I'll explore exploring it.
- Good.

05:33.835 --> 05:35.837
Seems like you have
this under control,

05:35.962 --> 05:38.506
so I'll just duck out and run
the company for a while.

05:38.589 --> 05:39.590
Okay.

05:43.636 --> 05:46.514
Okay, next stop
on the tour, sales.

05:46.848 --> 05:49.851
Here we go. Station
stop, Jim Halpert.

05:49.934 --> 05:51.936
Oh, boy, our resident truth teller.
Uh...

05:52.103 --> 05:53.563
All right, have at it.
Let her rip.

05:53.688 --> 05:55.106
What do you hate
about this place?

05:56.691 --> 05:58.651
Well, it's sales,
so you have to be able

05:58.776 --> 06:00.778
to live in the
world of rejection.

06:00.903 --> 06:02.363
Maybe you do.

06:02.613 --> 06:03.948
Hi, I'm Dwight.

06:04.115 --> 06:07.744
Sales is really not so hard, okay.
It's paper.

06:08.077 --> 06:09.537
We have it,
and they want it so bad

06:09.662 --> 06:11.122
they are willing
to pay for it.

06:11.289 --> 06:12.290
Jim?

06:12.373 --> 06:14.625
Well, it's not that easy.

06:14.709 --> 06:16.210
It's kind of
sometimes difficult.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.713
It's the second-easiest
job in the world.

06:18.921 --> 06:20.673
Being a mom.
I love shopping.

06:21.174 --> 06:23.134
And sales is just
the other side of that.

06:23.301 --> 06:25.094
That's true.

06:25.803 --> 06:29.140
You know, if you joined
our sales department,

06:29.223 --> 06:31.100
you would be working
very closely with our

06:31.225 --> 06:33.102
department head,
Mr. Dwight Schrute.

06:33.186 --> 06:34.187
That's me.

06:34.353 --> 06:37.231
Dwight, why don't you tell Susan
about some of your hobbies.

06:37.648 --> 06:39.400
Oh... Mmm-hmm. Survival skills.

06:39.817 --> 06:41.235
Ranking of animals.

06:41.444 --> 06:42.779
Maybe over a beer

06:42.862 --> 06:45.823
after she's closed her first sale.

06:47.033 --> 06:50.536
Well, make that a red wine and
I'll tell you my animal rankings.

06:53.331 --> 06:56.125
How am I
supposed to pull this off?

06:56.501 --> 06:59.754
The entire office is being nicer to
her than they've ever been to me.

06:59.837 --> 07:01.464
What I wouldn't give
for one of Phyllis'

07:01.547 --> 07:03.341
classic room-clearing
farts right now.

07:04.675 --> 07:05.843
Ready?

07:09.555 --> 07:11.140
What do you think?
Huh?

07:11.224 --> 07:12.850
Umm, no.

07:12.934 --> 07:14.102
No. This is not a gym.

07:14.185 --> 07:15.812
This is like a
scene out of Saw V.

07:15.895 --> 07:17.355
You haven't even
looked around yet.

07:17.438 --> 07:18.606
Look.

07:18.856 --> 07:20.983
Gravel bucket squat yoke.

07:24.654 --> 07:26.197
Right?

07:26.447 --> 07:27.448
Hmm.

07:28.074 --> 07:29.867
Dedicated phone
book ripping station.

07:32.495 --> 07:34.288
You ever cut tin before? No.

07:34.664 --> 07:37.542
Five yards in and your
forearms will be on fire.

07:37.750 --> 07:39.293
Plus, I will buy
the tin back from you

07:39.418 --> 07:41.003
that you cut for
two cents a yard.

07:42.296 --> 07:44.132
Now, let's go
over membership.

07:44.215 --> 07:45.883
I'm gonna need
the first month's

07:45.967 --> 07:48.302
and the last month's
up front for $49 a month.

07:48.761 --> 07:51.347
But every third
month is $59 a month.

07:51.472 --> 07:55.059
But the fourth month is a
discount month at $19 per month.

07:55.184 --> 07:57.645
Obviously, you know
how a gym works.

07:58.229 --> 08:00.189
So you know I'm not gonna
pay money for this.

08:00.398 --> 08:01.941
You want people to
come to your gym?

08:02.233 --> 08:03.901
Make a real gym.

08:04.318 --> 08:05.570
Darryl.

08:08.531 --> 08:09.699
Make a real gym.

08:09.907 --> 08:12.577
I was thinking accounting
might be a good fit

08:12.660 --> 08:14.036
because I really
clicked with Oscar,

08:14.120 --> 08:16.706
and I do have some
experience with bookkeeping.

08:16.914 --> 08:20.251
But we already have a surplus
of accountants as it is.

08:20.418 --> 08:23.921
I would work in customer
service, um, HR, even.

08:24.005 --> 08:25.840
Those are fully
staffed as well.

08:25.923 --> 08:29.510
Are you telling me that there's
no one in this entire office

08:29.594 --> 08:32.096
that could use
an extra pair of hands?

08:32.930 --> 08:34.015
Yes.

08:34.098 --> 08:39.270
I am the CEO, and I am telling
an employee of mine what to do.

08:40.438 --> 08:42.648
Let me beat around
the bush for a second.

08:43.107 --> 08:46.861
Our chairman of the board has
some very strong feelings...

08:46.944 --> 08:49.697
Robert, it's all right.
This is very uncomfortable.

08:49.780 --> 08:53.826
Obviously, there's no place for
me here, so thank you for trying.

08:53.910 --> 08:54.911
Why don't we
just let it go?

08:55.036 --> 08:56.037
No.
Absolutely not.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.581
Andrew, there must be
something you can do.

08:58.664 --> 08:59.999
There must be. Think.

09:02.251 --> 09:03.920
Well, there are
a lot of considerations.

09:04.003 --> 09:07.632
I would be eternally grateful.

09:09.133 --> 09:12.637
It's not a bad thing
to have the CEO owe you one.

09:16.474 --> 09:19.310
All right!
Well, then, welcome aboard.

09:27.693 --> 09:28.819
So what happens next?

09:28.945 --> 09:33.449
We get you over to HR and then
get you set up with accounting.

09:34.659 --> 09:35.785
Hang on.

09:35.910 --> 09:37.870
- Hello?
- Say "hello, grandma."

09:39.956 --> 09:41.332
Hi, gam-gam.

09:41.499 --> 09:44.043
Hold one finger up to Susan.
You'll just be a second.

09:45.461 --> 09:46.879
You numbskull!

09:46.963 --> 09:48.506
You were given
a very simple task.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.591
I could not have been
more clear with you.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.927
Now say, "Are you
taking your medicine?"

09:53.386 --> 09:55.221
Are you taking your med-meds?

09:55.346 --> 09:58.224
Why can you not say
exactly what I tell you?

09:58.349 --> 10:01.435
Undo this. Undo it.

10:05.564 --> 10:07.191
You didn't say good-bye
to your grandmother.

10:07.942 --> 10:09.819
We promised we'd
never say good-bye.

10:14.282 --> 10:17.159
Attention! I am
now accepting memberships

10:17.243 --> 10:19.453
for the Dwight Schrute
Gym for Muscles.

10:19.870 --> 10:21.622
First 20 members
can take advantage

10:21.706 --> 10:23.791
of our "pay what
you weigh" promotion.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.418
All I need
is another gym.

10:25.584 --> 10:26.752
As if I don't
have enough drama.

10:26.877 --> 10:29.672
We have a gym at home.
It's called the bedroom.

10:29.755 --> 10:30.881
Who's spotting who?

10:31.048 --> 10:32.383
"Don't use the bike
in the corner,

10:32.550 --> 10:33.926
"that's Bruce's.
Jeremy says..."

10:34.010 --> 10:35.344
Enough. Oscar, enough.

10:35.428 --> 10:36.929
Kelly?
I have these sneakers,

10:37.096 --> 10:39.473
which are basically just like
a gym for your feet, so...

10:42.476 --> 10:44.770
That's okay. I know
how to build a business.

10:45.146 --> 10:46.564
You gotta bet the
black people to do it

10:46.731 --> 10:48.190
to get the white
people to do it.

10:48.607 --> 10:50.735
Then you gotta get the black
people to stop doing it.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.737
One step at a time.

10:53.237 --> 10:54.905
Did you bring your
passport with you?

10:55.448 --> 10:56.741
Who walks around
with their passport?

10:56.824 --> 10:57.825
Well, I do.

10:57.908 --> 10:58.993
Always ready
for adventure.

10:59.076 --> 11:00.453
Have you had any?

11:00.661 --> 11:01.704
No.

11:06.417 --> 11:07.752
Hey, GUYS

11:08.377 --> 11:11.255
So Robert doesn't want
his wife working here.

11:11.422 --> 11:13.841
So now that she is,
we have to drive her away.

11:14.258 --> 11:18.054
Andy, if he didn't want her working
here, then why did you hire her?

11:18.304 --> 11:21.349
Oscar, it was a mistake.

11:21.974 --> 11:25.269
But one that can be fixed by
all of us being mean to her.

11:25.519 --> 11:28.773
How can we do that?
She's simply wonderful.

11:28.981 --> 11:30.149
This is all pathetic.

11:30.316 --> 11:32.943
I am not asking,
lam ordering.

11:33.778 --> 11:35.196
How mean are
we talking about?

11:35.321 --> 11:36.447
It would be great if
she were gone by lunch.

11:37.281 --> 11:39.909
Erin, you're up. Find her a place
to work, but not too comfortable.

11:39.992 --> 11:42.411
Got it. I know exactly
which stapler to give her.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.292
Here you go.

11:51.962 --> 11:53.381
Um, do you think it
would be possible

11:53.506 --> 11:54.965
to move to that
desk over there?

11:55.049 --> 11:58.219
Because this seems a bit cramped,
and I don't have a computer.

11:58.386 --> 11:59.720
Well, that's a sales desk.

11:59.804 --> 12:02.598
Yeah. You need to be over
here with us accountants.

12:03.015 --> 12:05.142
Just sit here
and be quiet.

12:05.559 --> 12:08.312
And if you have a question,
just raise your hand.

12:09.021 --> 12:12.733
But I'm gonna save you some time,
sweetie, and give you the answer now.

12:13.401 --> 12:16.695
I don't know.

12:18.656 --> 12:20.074
No, I don't think
we should be trying

12:20.199 --> 12:21.617
to make this
place seem unpleasant.

12:21.826 --> 12:23.244
I think we should
let this place

12:23.369 --> 12:24.745
just crush her
spirit by itself.

12:24.829 --> 12:26.455
I mean, it knows
what it's doing.

12:26.872 --> 12:28.332
That's Gerald.

12:28.499 --> 12:30.835
Oh, wow. So cute.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.420
Oh, that is so cute.

12:34.088 --> 12:36.674
Oh, he's so tiny.
Is he in a ladle?

12:36.799 --> 12:37.925
Yeah, he's in a ladle.

12:38.134 --> 12:40.261
That's adorable. How on earth
did you get him in a ladle?

12:40.344 --> 12:41.554
He did it himself.

12:41.637 --> 12:43.180
Is that ladle
stainless or...

12:43.264 --> 12:44.473
Oh, stainless.
Williams Sonoma.

12:44.849 --> 12:47.017
Excuse me, waiter,
there's a dog in my soup.

12:47.101 --> 12:48.978
It's not
that kind of ladle.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.105
Very cute.
Let me see.

12:51.522 --> 12:53.232
Just the battery
on these things.

12:53.357 --> 12:55.109
I'm sorry,
I've gotta recharge this.

12:56.861 --> 12:59.113
I get it.
Last time I had a job,

12:59.196 --> 13:01.115
I remember I hated
the boss' wife.

13:02.491 --> 13:04.535
Of course, she was
married to Robert.

13:05.536 --> 13:10.374
Your employees don't
seem to be taking to me.

13:11.917 --> 13:13.043
Andy!

13:15.588 --> 13:17.715
Andy, could you
step in here, please?

13:18.924 --> 13:20.050
We'll fix this.

13:20.384 --> 13:22.470
What is going on?

13:22.553 --> 13:23.679
Please.

13:24.555 --> 13:26.932
Ah, Andrew, my wife

13:27.391 --> 13:31.729
has brought up an issue that
requires your attention.

13:32.521 --> 13:36.901
So, if you'll excuse me,
I should step out,

13:37.443 --> 13:42.072
get to the ATM before that homeless
man sets up camp for the night.

13:47.453 --> 13:49.788
Okey-dokey, artichokey.

13:51.832 --> 13:52.875
You hate it, don't you?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.084
Do you not want me here?

13:54.919 --> 13:56.378
Why would you say that?
It's okay.

13:56.462 --> 13:58.339
I understand. I'm not
sure how I would feel

13:58.422 --> 14:00.341
about having the boss'
wife work for me either.

14:00.508 --> 14:02.259
It's not that exactly.

14:02.343 --> 14:03.636
But it is something.

14:03.719 --> 14:07.139
Let's just say that if you
don't want to work here,

14:07.223 --> 14:08.974
I am totally
prepared to respect that.

14:09.058 --> 14:10.935
Why would you not
want me working here?

14:11.018 --> 14:12.478
I don't know.

14:12.603 --> 14:16.774
I think I understand
what you're going through.

14:17.525 --> 14:21.695
My husband can be a very
difficult man to read, can't he?

14:21.779 --> 14:22.821
Yes!

14:24.240 --> 14:26.116
The dude is an enigma.

14:26.617 --> 14:28.369
So he is mixed up
in this, isn't he?

14:31.288 --> 14:32.498
Got it.

14:35.626 --> 14:36.961
What do you
think you're doing?

14:37.127 --> 14:38.295
Getting my sweat on.

14:38.629 --> 14:40.673
I build you this
temple to the human body,

14:40.798 --> 14:42.883
and you're lifting
what, five pounds?

14:42.967 --> 14:44.885
I just did, like,
35 minutes on the treadmill.

14:44.969 --> 14:47.221
I was watching you. You want to
know how long it really was?

14:47.304 --> 14:48.764
No.
Eight minutes!

14:48.847 --> 14:50.891
Dude, I'm gonna be
here all week, right?

14:51.267 --> 14:53.602
Five days a week.
I figure I'll start slow.

14:53.686 --> 14:56.355
Is that the same philosophy
you apply to buffalo wings?

14:59.149 --> 15:02.695
I want you to bring that same
buffalo wing passion to this gym!

15:03.028 --> 15:05.489
I'm gonna make you
look like Lebron James!

15:05.990 --> 15:07.616
It's Lejon Brames.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.451
That's what I said.
Yeah.

15:10.035 --> 15:11.453
Get it right.
I know.

15:11.662 --> 15:12.663
Cameras...

15:13.372 --> 15:14.748
Still here. Terrific.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.085
Andy and I had
a great conversation.

15:19.420 --> 15:21.672
And I just want
to let you know

15:21.797 --> 15:24.049
that I am not going
to be working here.

15:26.635 --> 15:27.678
Well, that's a shame.

15:27.845 --> 15:29.722
It just was one of those things...
Is it?

15:30.764 --> 15:32.016
Because we
talked about it,

15:32.099 --> 15:34.018
and it seems like that
might be what you want.

15:34.184 --> 15:35.894
Which is fine.
Where did this come from?

15:36.020 --> 15:37.104
Did Andy say that?

15:37.187 --> 15:38.355
No, he did not.

15:38.522 --> 15:39.732
But I could tell
he was struggling

15:39.857 --> 15:41.066
to understand what
was expected of him.

15:41.150 --> 15:44.528
What's the struggle? He made a
great call, hired a great person.

15:44.612 --> 15:46.030
You sure about that?

15:46.530 --> 15:48.115
Absolutely.
No games?

15:48.449 --> 15:49.533
No games.

15:49.783 --> 15:51.869
Because Andy seemed to think
there was some information

15:51.952 --> 15:53.579
he was not able
to share with me.

15:53.662 --> 15:55.205
Enough of this. I mean, real...
Enough.

15:55.289 --> 15:58.375
It's gotten way out of hand.
Andrew, this is my wife.

15:58.834 --> 16:02.880
Whatever privacy you were trying to
protect between us, I thank you for.

16:03.088 --> 16:05.299
But it is not
welcome right now.

16:05.549 --> 16:07.384
Just be honest.

16:10.346 --> 16:12.056
Andy...
Yes.

16:12.222 --> 16:13.724
Why do you keep
looking at my husband?

16:13.849 --> 16:15.351
Andy, just answer
the question.

16:15.601 --> 16:16.602
No games?

16:16.685 --> 16:17.770
No games.

16:19.063 --> 16:20.230
Okay.

16:20.939 --> 16:22.983
I mean, it was kind
of funny, actually.

16:23.067 --> 16:24.818
Robert storms in,
and he says,

16:24.902 --> 16:26.236
"In four seconds,
my wife's gonna be in here.

16:26.362 --> 16:27.488
"I told her she
could work here.

16:27.571 --> 16:29.782
"Under no circumstances can
that be allowed to happen."

16:29.990 --> 16:31.492
You lying son of a bitch!

16:35.913 --> 16:37.331
Tell my wife you're lying.

16:38.874 --> 16:41.460
I am lying.
lam a compulsive liar.

16:41.543 --> 16:42.503
That's not true, is it?

16:42.586 --> 16:44.088
No, it's not.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.882
I tell the truth
most of the time,

16:46.965 --> 16:49.093
and I was just telling the
truth about your husband.

16:49.218 --> 16:50.636
Jim knows. He was there.

16:50.761 --> 16:52.179
This is preposterous.

16:52.262 --> 16:54.098
Robert...
Let's get Jim in here.

16:56.684 --> 16:57.810
Where's Jim?

16:57.893 --> 16:59.728
He just rolled out
and crawled out.

17:00.270 --> 17:03.148
Can you call security, tell them
to keep an eye out for him?

17:03.691 --> 17:04.900
Time to settle this.

17:06.777 --> 17:07.986
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.279
I just need to get through.

17:09.446 --> 17:12.616
Just real quick.
Real quick, open... Okay.

17:18.288 --> 17:19.832
That's weird.

17:20.749 --> 17:22.626
Well, he's gotta be
around here somewhere.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.971
Ow! Ow!

17:34.471 --> 17:35.472
Ow!

17:41.937 --> 17:43.647
Creed, I was never
here, all right?

17:43.731 --> 17:46.108
Okay. What about
your friend?

17:47.860 --> 17:49.153
Oh, boy.

17:53.323 --> 17:56.994
This is my gym, my rules. You do
exactly as I say, no questions asked.

17:57.619 --> 17:58.912
Yeah, I'm gonna
ask questions,

17:58.996 --> 18:00.497
and I might not
do what you say.

18:00.664 --> 18:03.292
First thing, we're gonna
stretch the pelvic bowl.

18:03.876 --> 18:06.128
Ready? Get down on the floor.

18:06.462 --> 18:07.963
Okay, I'm not doing that.

18:09.173 --> 18:10.382
Really?

18:10.466 --> 18:12.176
Too embarrassing
for you? Huh?

18:12.259 --> 18:15.095
You wish that every exercise was
strutting around the gym like the Fonz?

18:15.220 --> 18:17.347
Well, how do you think
the Fonz got so cool?

18:17.639 --> 18:19.641
He stretched
his pelvic bowl.

18:22.352 --> 18:23.604
I didn't know
Darryl joined.

18:23.854 --> 18:24.855
Looks that way.

18:25.147 --> 18:27.357
Nice pelvic bowl. Deep.

18:30.402 --> 18:31.528
Hello, Jim.

18:31.695 --> 18:32.863
No, no. No, no, no!

18:33.155 --> 18:34.698
Don't. Damn it, Tuna!

18:35.032 --> 18:38.243
So, I think you know
what we want to know.

18:38.494 --> 18:39.745
Do I?
Yes.

18:39.828 --> 18:41.079
I know. I do.

18:41.747 --> 18:45.042
Jim, I've had enough
of your unhelpfulness.

18:45.459 --> 18:46.752
I really wish I could help.

18:46.877 --> 18:48.295
I'm not really sure how I can.

18:48.378 --> 18:50.339
For God's sake,
did Robert tell you

18:50.464 --> 18:52.424
that he didn't
want me working here?

18:52.674 --> 18:54.218
That's the thing.

18:54.301 --> 18:56.678
See, I didn't want to get in the
middle of this. Still don't.

18:56.804 --> 18:59.014
But here's something.

18:59.097 --> 19:02.267
I feel that maybe,
if we take a step back,

19:03.060 --> 19:06.939
this is a simple case of
anxiety to work with a spouse.

19:07.231 --> 19:09.650
I think we've
got ourselves an answer.

19:09.733 --> 19:11.777
No... That makes
complete sense, right?

19:11.902 --> 19:13.570
Thank you all for a wonderful day.
Perfect!

19:13.904 --> 19:14.988
Yes? Jim...

19:15.072 --> 19:16.114
Answer the question,
please.

19:19.701 --> 19:20.953
I don't know what you
want me to tell you.

19:21.286 --> 19:23.664
To be really honest,
my wife works here.

19:24.039 --> 19:25.290
And I love it.

19:25.415 --> 19:27.334
She literally
makes me work harder.

19:27.501 --> 19:30.128
She makes me smarter. She makes
me remember why I'm here.

19:31.213 --> 19:34.258
And between us, she's on
maternity leave right now,

19:34.466 --> 19:36.593
and I would love to leave
this room and see her face.

19:36.718 --> 19:39.263
I would love it.
I don't know how this helps,

19:39.429 --> 19:40.430
but it's just
what I'm thinking.

19:40.514 --> 19:41.723
All right. Thanks.

19:41.974 --> 19:43.517
Yes. All right.

19:50.065 --> 19:51.066
Uh...

19:51.149 --> 19:53.235
Yeah.

19:59.491 --> 20:00.909
Thank you.

20:10.586 --> 20:11.670
Andy.

20:12.504 --> 20:14.089
Hey, Mrs. California.

20:14.172 --> 20:18.969
Hey. I'm sorry about the
position you were put in today.

20:19.636 --> 20:21.513
You know, honestly, we all
wanted you to work there.

20:22.514 --> 20:24.308
Except for him.
Especially me.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.852
Yes, I thought we
really hit it off.

20:26.977 --> 20:28.103
Yeah.

20:29.021 --> 20:30.147
Well, different circumstances.

20:30.272 --> 20:31.398
Yeah.

20:31.481 --> 20:32.858
Who knows?
Who knows?

20:32.941 --> 20:35.277
Maybe after all
this settles down...

20:35.527 --> 20:36.778
Totally.

20:38.030 --> 20:39.239
It's a date.

20:39.323 --> 20:40.324
Hmm?

20:42.534 --> 20:44.077
You're nothing!
You're so weak!

20:44.161 --> 20:46.163
You call yourself
a man? Huh?

20:46.246 --> 20:48.457
This doesn't help me. I don't
respond to that kind of strategy.

20:48.540 --> 20:49.583
Okay, fine.

20:49.666 --> 20:52.920
Finish your set on your own, and
never come back to my gym again!

20:53.879 --> 20:55.380
Dwight, come back and spot me.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.508
All right, I'll help you.

20:59.593 --> 21:01.803
But first, you gotta
tell me what your goal is.

21:01.887 --> 21:02.888
What do you want?

21:03.013 --> 21:04.014
To push this bar up.

21:04.097 --> 21:07.142
No! Because if that was the case,
the bar would be up by now.

21:07.351 --> 21:08.435
What is your goal?

21:08.560 --> 21:09.686
Help me!

21:09.895 --> 21:11.563
What do you want?

21:11.688 --> 21:13.357
To look good for Val!

21:13.815 --> 21:15.192
Val Kilmer?

21:15.275 --> 21:17.486
I don't buy it,
that doesn't make any sense.

21:19.321 --> 21:20.405
Wow.

21:21.073 --> 21:22.532
I figured out your goal.

21:24.034 --> 21:27.245
I am gonna make you the buffest
dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.
