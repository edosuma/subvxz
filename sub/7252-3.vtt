WEBVTT

00:01.376 --> 00:02.210
PREVIOUSLY ON "GILMORE GIRLS"...

00:01.376 --> 00:02.210
ARE YOU OKAY?

00:02.252 --> 00:03.504
I FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT.

00:03.545 --> 00:05.255
I WAS MARRIED,

00:03.545 --> 00:05.255
AND I THREW IT ALL AWAY

00:05.297 --> 00:07.925
FOR SOMEONE WHO DUMPED ME ONCE

00:05.297 --> 00:07.925
AND THEN JUST BAILED ON ME.

00:07.967 --> 00:09.551
YOUR FATHER IS MOVING

00:07.967 --> 00:09.551
INTO THE POOL HOUSE.

00:09.593 --> 00:10.845
YOU'RE SEPARATED

00:09.593 --> 00:10.845
BY THE POOL.

00:10.886 --> 00:12.387
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

00:10.886 --> 00:12.387
HAVING AN AFFAIR

00:12.429 --> 00:13.681
WITH PROFESSOR ASHER FLEMING.

00:13.722 --> 00:14.807
YOU ARE SUCH A PRUDE.

00:16.725 --> 00:18.560
Lorelai: SHAKEN, NOT STIRRED,

00:16.725 --> 00:18.560
PLEASE, JEEVES.

00:18.602 --> 00:20.145
HIS NAME IS ROBERT.

00:20.187 --> 00:21.981
I THOUGHT EVERY BUTLER'S NAME

00:20.187 --> 00:21.981
WAS JEEVES.

00:22.021 --> 00:23.524
HE'S NOT A BUTLER.

00:22.021 --> 00:23.524
HE'S A VALET.

00:23.565 --> 00:24.566
SO HE PARKS YOUR CAR?

00:24.608 --> 00:25.943
NO, HE DOES NOT PARK MY CAR.

00:25.985 --> 00:28.403
HE DOES EXACTLY

00:25.985 --> 00:28.403
WHAT YOU SEE HIM DOING.

00:28.445 --> 00:29.864
HE ATTENDS TO MY NEEDS.

00:29.905 --> 00:31.406
HE'S A GEISHA.

00:31.448 --> 00:34.201
YOU'LL BE QUIETER ONCE

00:31.448 --> 00:34.201
YOU HAVE A DRINK, I ASSUME.

00:34.242 --> 00:35.786
SO, YOUNG LADY,

00:35.828 --> 00:38.664
YOU'RE STARTING YOUR SECOND

00:35.828 --> 00:38.664
YEAR OF YALE THIS WEEK.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.624
I MOVE INTO BRANFORD

00:38.706 --> 00:40.624
ON MONDAY.

00:40.666 --> 00:43.418
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE BRANFORD.

00:40.666 --> 00:43.418
THAT'S WHERE I LIVED.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.044
I KNOW.

00:45.086 --> 00:46.672
IT IS THE OLDEST OF YALE'S

00:45.086 --> 00:46.672
RESIDENTIAL COLLEGES.

00:46.714 --> 00:49.048
THEY HAVE THESE CARILLON BELLS

00:46.714 --> 00:49.048
THAT ARE ENCHANTING,

00:49.090 --> 00:51.218
AND IT HAS WHAT WAS CALLED

00:49.090 --> 00:51.218
BY ROBERT FROST

00:51.259 --> 00:53.762

I'LL GET SETTLED IN,

00:55.931 --> 00:58.266
AND THEN WE CAN HAVE LUNCH

00:55.931 --> 00:58.266
THERE.

00:58.308 --> 00:59.894
YOU WANTED ME TO REMIND YOU

00:59.935 --> 01:02.771
THAT YOU WERE GOING TO BRING OUT

00:59.935 --> 01:02.771
THE HUNGARIAN CHEESE, SIR.

01:02.813 --> 01:04.982
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

01:05.816 --> 01:07.150
THIS IS CRAZY.

01:07.192 --> 01:08.819
WELL, IT DEPENDS ON YOUR

01:07.192 --> 01:08.819
DEFINITION OF "CRAZY."

01:08.861 --> 01:10.237
I, FOR ONE,

01:10.278 --> 01:12.113
FOUND THE MARIAH CAREY

01:10.278 --> 01:12.113
PHONE MESSAGES TO HER FANS

01:12.155 --> 01:13.741
JUST REFRESHINGLY

01:12.155 --> 01:13.741
IMAGINATIVE.

01:13.782 --> 01:15.492
WE'RE HAVING DRINKS

01:13.782 --> 01:15.492
IN THE POOL HOUSE.

01:15.534 --> 01:17.160
THE LAST TIME

01:15.534 --> 01:17.160
I WAS IN THE POOL

01:15.534 --> 01:17.160
HOUSE

01:17.202 --> 01:19.204
WAS THE LAST TIME

01:17.202 --> 01:19.204
I WAS IN THE POOL.

01:19.246 --> 01:21.040
SO, GRANDPA'S ACTUALLY LIVING

01:19.246 --> 01:21.040

01:21.081 --> 01:22.082
LOOKS LIKE.

01:22.123 --> 01:23.375
DO YOU THINK HE'S HAPPY?

01:23.417 --> 01:26.127
I THINK HE'S VERY HAPPY

01:23.417 --> 01:26.127
WITH HIS BOOKS

01:26.169 --> 01:27.128
AND HIS SPECIAL FRIEND ROBERT.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.672
DON'T BE GROSS.

01:28.714 --> 01:31.050

01:28.714 --> 01:31.050
TWO GROWN MEN OUT HERE ALONE

01:31.090 --> 01:33.010

01:33.052 --> 01:34.762
OH, JEEZ.

01:33.052 --> 01:34.762
DON'T BE SO PURITANICAL.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.555
AFTER ALL,

01:34.803 --> 01:36.555
HEATHER HAS TWO MOMMIES.

01:36.597 --> 01:40.017
ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE CHEESE,

01:36.597 --> 01:40.017

01:50.318 --> 01:51.820
DINNER IS SERVED

01:50.318 --> 01:51.820

01:51.862 --> 01:55.532
I WILL TELL MR. GILMORE.

01:55.574 --> 01:58.243
DINNER IS SERVED

01:55.574 --> 01:58.243

01:58.285 --> 01:59.578

01:58.285 --> 01:59.578
OUR DRINKS YET.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.121
BUT THE MADAM IS READY NOW.

02:01.162 --> 02:04.041
WELL, LADIES,

02:01.162 --> 02:04.041
IT'S BEEN A LOVELY EVENING.

02:04.083 --> 02:05.125
UNTIL NEXT WEEK...

02:05.166 --> 02:07.836
HOLD ON, DAD.

02:07.878 --> 02:10.130
THANK YOU, GRANDPA.

02:10.171 --> 02:12.091
YEAH, THANKS

02:10.171 --> 02:12.091

I HAVE THE AIR-CONDITIONING

02:19.139 --> 02:20.975

02:21.016 --> 02:22.142
I LIKE IT, GRANDMA.

02:22.183 --> 02:23.393
OH, MY GOD,

02:22.183 --> 02:23.393

02:23.435 --> 02:25.562
STOP IT.

02:23.435 --> 02:25.562
THANK YOU.

02:25.604 --> 02:28.231
IT'S FENNEL POTATO PUREE WITH A

02:25.604 --> 02:28.231
TOUCH OF CHILI TO GIVE IT SPICE.

02:28.273 --> 02:31.526
I THOUGHT WE COULD GO EXOTIC

02:28.273 --> 02:31.526
NOW THAT IT'S JUST US GIRLS.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.862
IF YOU REALLY WANT AN EXOTIC

02:31.568 --> 02:33.862
GIRLS' NIGHT OUT, MOM,

02:33.904 --> 02:34.989
LET'S HIT BAJA.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.657

02:36.698 --> 02:38.533
DIFFERENT ROOM,

02:36.698 --> 02:38.533
SAME REACTION.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.119
OH, NOTHING MUCH.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.745
WHAT WAS NEW

02:40.160 --> 02:41.745
20 MINUTES AGO?

02:41.787 --> 02:43.288
EXCUSE ME?

02:43.330 --> 02:45.040
WHAT DID YOU TALK ABOUT

02:43.330 --> 02:45.040

02:45.082 --> 02:46.708
OH, WELL --

I MEAN, JUST BECAUSE HE GETS

02:46.750 --> 02:48.585
YOU FIRST IN THE EVENING

02:48.627 --> 02:51.046
DOESN'T MEAN YOU GET TO WASTE

02:48.627 --> 02:51.046

SO, YOU JUST TELL ME

03:06.020 --> 03:07.395
YOU KNEW THAT?

03:07.437 --> 03:08.396
HE TOLD YOU THAT?

03:08.438 --> 03:09.815
YOU'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED

03:09.857 --> 03:11.150
EVERYTHING THERE IS

03:09.857 --> 03:11.150

03:11.190 --> 03:12.901
YOU'RE ALL TALKED OUT.

HE GETS YOU FIRST,

03:18.406 --> 03:20.784
WHAT DO YOU THINK

03:18.406 --> 03:20.784
YOU'RE DOING?

03:20.826 --> 03:22.744
I NEEDED TO GET SOMETHING

03:20.826 --> 03:22.744
OUT OF MY STUDY.

03:22.786 --> 03:25.204
YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO STAY

03:22.786 --> 03:25.204
IN THE POOL HOUSE.

03:25.246 --> 03:26.498
THAT IS WHAT WE AGREED ON.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.875
I AM IN THE POOL HOUSE.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.126
OH, REALLY? RIGHT NOW?

03:29.168 --> 03:30.377
NO, NOT RIGHT NOW.

03:30.418 --> 03:32.295
I TOLD YOU I HAD TO GET

03:30.418 --> 03:32.295
SOMETHING.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.839
YOU SHOULD HAVE MADE

03:32.337 --> 03:33.839
AN APPOINTMENT.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.090
TO GO INTO MY OWN STUDY?

03:35.132 --> 03:36.591
YOU DON'T LIVE HERE

03:35.132 --> 03:36.591
ANYMORE.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.844
WHAT IF I WAS SITTING IN

03:36.633 --> 03:38.844
THE LIVING ROOM STARK-NAKED?

03:38.886 --> 03:40.846
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN IN

03:38.886 --> 03:40.846
THE LIVING ROOM STARK-NAKED.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.222
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN

03:40.888 --> 03:42.222
STARK-NAKED.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.016
WE WENT SKINNY-DIPPING

03:42.263 --> 03:44.016
ONE NIGHT,

03:44.058 --> 03:45.142
AND YOU WORE AN OVERCOAT.

03:45.184 --> 03:46.351
THE WATER WAS FREEZING!

04:46.578 --> 04:47.579
WHY DO WE NEED THE WORD "POTTY"?

04:47.621 --> 04:48.956
IS IT REALLY THAT MUCH HARDER

04:48.997 --> 04:50.540
FOR A KID TO LEARN

04:48.997 --> 04:50.540
THE WORD "BATHROOM"?

04:50.582 --> 04:52.251
I DON'T KNOW.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.002
"TIMMY, DO YOU HAVE TO GO

04:52.292 --> 04:54.002
POTTY?"

04:54.044 --> 04:55.837
OR "TIMMY, DO YOU HAVE TO GO

04:54.044 --> 04:55.837
TO THE BATHROOM?"

04:55.879 --> 04:58.215
SEE? INTERCHANGEABLE.

04:55.879 --> 04:58.215
THEY'RE NOT.

04:58.257 --> 04:59.507
HOW ARE THEY NOT

04:58.257 --> 04:59.507
INTERCHANGEABLE?

04:59.549 --> 05:01.009
TO GO POTTY IS AN ACTION.

05:01.051 --> 05:03.428
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM IS

05:01.051 --> 05:03.428
TO GO INTO A SPECIFIC PLACE.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.679
I HATE THE WORD "POTTY."

05:04.721 --> 05:05.764
WHAT DID YOU TEACH ME

05:04.721 --> 05:05.764
TO SAY?

05:05.806 --> 05:07.891
"BATHROOM."

05:07.933 --> 05:10.602
I'M 2, AND I SAY, "MOMMY,

05:07.933 --> 05:10.602
I HAVE TO GO TO THE" --

05:10.644 --> 05:11.853
THE ROOM WHERE LEGENDS DIE.

05:11.895 --> 05:12.854
WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

05:12.896 --> 05:14.022
A FOSTER HOME.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.857
YOU'LL THANK ME ONE DAY.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.857
HI.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.192
I'M WORKING.

05:17.234 --> 05:19.360
THIS IS THE BEGINNING

05:17.234 --> 05:19.360
OF A RELATIONSHIP.

05:19.402 --> 05:20.779
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ACT

05:19.402 --> 05:20.779
STUPID.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.614
I'LL DO THE CHICKEN DANCE

05:20.821 --> 05:22.614
ON MY LUNCH BREAK.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.449
HEADING BACK TO SCHOOL?

05:22.656 --> 05:24.449
YEAH, SOPHOMORE YEAR.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.951
ANYTHING YOU WANT

05:24.491 --> 05:25.951
ON THE HOUSE.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.702
YOU WON'T FLIRT WITH ME

05:25.993 --> 05:27.702
IN FRONT OF MY DAUGHTER.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.704
SHE'S GONNA THINK THERE'S

05:27.744 --> 05:29.704
SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME.

05:29.746 --> 05:32.457
I GOT THAT CONFIRMATION LETTER

05:29.746 --> 05:32.457
A LONG TIME AGO.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.168
SCRAMBLED EGGS

05:32.499 --> 05:34.168
WITH CHEDDAR CHEESE

05:34.209 --> 05:35.627
AND HALF BACON,

05:34.209 --> 05:35.627
HALF SAUSAGE.

24:29.093 --> 24:31.304
I DIDN'T THINK THE DINER

24:29.093 --> 24:31.304

24:31.345 --> 24:32.470
I HAD CAESAR OPEN.

24:32.512 --> 24:34.098
WELL, HE DID,

24:32.512 --> 24:34.098

24:45.025 --> 24:47.903

24:45.025 --> 24:47.903
EVENTUALLY, RIGHT?

24:47.945 --> 24:49.238
SO, WE'LL HEAR ABOUT IT

24:47.945 --> 24:49.238

24:49.280 --> 24:50.990
FEW WEEKS.

24:51.031 --> 24:53.451
SIX MONTHS OF HEARING ABOUT IT,

24:51.031 --> 24:53.451
BUT THEN IT'LL DIE DOWN.

24:53.491 --> 24:55.411
AND EVERYTHING WILL GET BACK

24:53.491 --> 24:55.411
TO NORMAL,

24:55.453 --> 24:56.745
SO, OKAY, WELL, THEY KNOW.

25:12.219 --> 25:14.054
THAT'S A LOT OF BOOKS

25:12.219 --> 25:14.054
YOU GOT THERE.

25:14.096 --> 25:16.432
THE VERY FACT THAT THE BOOKSTORE

25:14.096 --> 25:16.432
HAD ANY IN STOCK

25:16.474 --> 25:18.934
SHOWS THE SAD NATURE

25:16.474 --> 25:18.934
OF AMERICAN READING HABITS.

25:18.976 --> 25:21.395
DO YOU NEED SOME HELP

25:18.976 --> 25:21.395

25:26.233 --> 25:28.152
TRIBUTE TO THIS GREAT MAN

25:28.194 --> 25:29.153

25:29.195 --> 25:30.363

PLEASE SAY

25:39.537 --> 25:41.499
IT LOOKS FAMILIAR.

25:41.539 --> 25:43.876
APPARENTLY IT DOESN'T LOOK

25:41.539 --> 25:43.876
FAMILIAR.

25:43.917 --> 25:46.586
NO, HOLD ON.

25:43.917 --> 25:46.586
HOLD ON.

25:46.628 --> 25:50.341

26:01.227 --> 26:02.602
THIS IS YOUR ROOM?

26:02.644 --> 26:03.812
I'M SURE.

26:03.854 --> 26:05.231
I COULD HAVE SWORN

26:03.854 --> 26:05.231
IT WAS HER ROOM.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.899
WHAT'S HER NAME?

26:05.272 --> 26:06.899
MAYBE I KNOW HER.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.234
UH, IT WAS SHORT.

26:08.275 --> 26:09.902
I CAN UNDERSTAND

26:08.275 --> 26:09.902
YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT,

26:09.943 --> 26:12.446

I'M SORRY

26:12.488 --> 26:13.489
ABOUT THE MIX-UP.

26:13.531 --> 26:15.157
MY FRIEND HERE MEANS NO HARM.

26:15.199 --> 26:18.202
HE JUST HAS TO LEARN

26:15.199 --> 26:18.202
GUINNESS AND BLONDES DON'T MIX.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.037
WE SINCERELY APOLOGIZE,

WHAT, THEY WERE OUT

26:26.710 --> 26:28.212

26:28.254 --> 26:30.381

26:28.254 --> 26:30.381

26:30.423 --> 26:33.342

26:30.423 --> 26:33.342

26:33.384 --> 26:36.095
SORRY. JUST YOU'RE PUTTING

26:33.384 --> 26:36.095
A POSTER OF HIM UP.

26:36.136 --> 26:37.430
YOU CAN SEE WHERE

26:36.136 --> 26:37.430
I GET THE IMPRESSION

26:37.471 --> 26:38.722
HE'S A BIT MORE

26:37.471 --> 26:38.722
THAN A TEACHER.

26:38.764 --> 26:40.682
WELL, HE WAS MORE

26:38.764 --> 26:40.682
THAN A TEACHER.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.809
HE WAS A GREAT WRITER

26:42.851 --> 26:44.644
AND AN INSPIRATION IN MANY

26:42.851 --> 26:44.644

26:44.686 --> 26:46.939
THAT YOU COULDN'T

26:44.686 --> 26:46.939

I'M JUST IRRITATED.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.672
BY ME?

27:12.714 --> 27:14.383
BECAUSE I FORGOT FOR A MOMENT

27:12.714 --> 27:14.383
WHO YOU WERE?

27:14.425 --> 27:17.595
NO, BECAUSE YOU SPEAK TO PEOPLE

27:14.425 --> 27:17.595
AS IF THEY'RE BELOW YOU.

27:17.635 --> 27:19.388
AH, YOUR FRIEND MARTY?

27:19.430 --> 27:21.014
YOU TALKED TO HIM

27:19.430 --> 27:21.014
LIKE HE WAS DIRT,

27:21.056 --> 27:22.808
AND THAT'S WHY I'M LOOKING

27:22.849 --> 27:25.852
A KICK-ASS MARGARITA.

27:25.894 --> 27:27.771
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID,

27:25.894 --> 27:27.771
IT'S HOW YOU SAID IT.

27:27.813 --> 27:28.772
HOW'D I SAY IT?

27:28.814 --> 27:31.150
LIKE JUDI DENCH.

27:31.191 --> 27:32.901
JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY

27:31.191 --> 27:32.901
DOESN'T HAVE MONEY

27:32.943 --> 27:34.945
OR A FANCY FAMILY DOESN'T

27:32.943 --> 27:34.945
MEAN THEY'RE INFERIOR TO YOU.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.238
I AGREE.

27:36.280 --> 27:39.283
JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY

27:36.280 --> 27:39.283
IS A BARTENDER,

27:39.325 --> 27:41.494
THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN TALK

27:39.325 --> 27:41.494
TO THEM LIKE A SERVANT.

27:41.535 --> 27:43.870
WELL...

27:43.912 --> 27:45.581
WHAT?!

27:45.623 --> 27:47.541
I PAID HIM. HE SERVED.

27:45.623 --> 27:47.541
THAT'S WHAT A SERVANT DOES.

27:47.583 --> 27:48.542
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

27:48.584 --> 27:49.876
FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT.

27:49.918 --> 27:51.003
HE WAS DOING A JOB.

27:51.044 --> 27:52.463
A JOB HE TOOK WILLINGLY.

27:52.505 --> 27:53.464
SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO WORK.

27:53.506 --> 27:55.174
AND I BET IF YOU ASK HIM,

27:55.215 --> 27:57.884
HE'LL TELL YOU HE MADE

27:55.215 --> 27:57.884
EXCELLENT TIPS THAT NIGHT.

27:57.926 --> 28:00.887
NOT THE POINT.

28:00.929 --> 28:02.431
JUST BECAUSE YOU PAY SOMEBODY,

28:02.473 --> 28:03.974
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

28:02.473 --> 28:03.974
YOU CAN SPEAK TO THEM

28:04.016 --> 28:05.518
AS IF THEY'RE BENEATH YOU.

28:05.559 --> 28:07.353
ACTUALLY, THE FACT THAT

28:05.559 --> 28:07.353
THIS IS A FREE COUNTRY

28:07.394 --> 28:09.563
MEANS I CAN SPEAK TO ANYONE

28:07.394 --> 28:09.563
IN ANY MANNER WHICH I CHOOSE.

28:09.605 --> 28:11.524
HOWEVER, THE RULES

28:09.605 --> 28:11.524

SHOW OF SNOBBERY,

28:13.651 --> 28:15.402
SO IF THAT'S YOUR ARGUMENT --

28:13.651 --> 28:15.402
I DON'T HAVE AN ARGUMENT.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.446
I CAN GIVE YOU A MOMENT

28:15.444 --> 28:17.446

28:19.906 --> 28:21.575
I DON'T LIKE IT

28:19.906 --> 28:21.575

28:21.617 --> 28:22.909
