00:07.040 --> 00:07.340
[Walter]
You're free.

00:08.760 --> 00:11.550
Until your trial date.
Which I am trying to push as

00:11.590 --> 00:13.130
far away as possible.

00:13.720 --> 00:14.800
This is great.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.470
Yeah, well- And I stress-

00:17.720 --> 00:19.680
You will be thrown back
in in a heartbeat-

00:19.720 --> 00:23.390
If you violate the conditions
of your release. The accused-

00:23.440 --> 00:26.440
must report
regularly to the RNC.

00:27.320 --> 00:28.860
Remain in the jurisdiction.

00:28.900 --> 00:31.820
Abstain from all illegal
activities.

00:31.860 --> 00:33.360
Hear this, Dum Dum.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.990
They know we're
P.I.s, right? I mean, how am I-

00:35.030 --> 00:35.240
supposed to
make a living?

00:36.160 --> 00:37.200
I've been in jail a long time.

00:37.240 --> 00:38.280
[Walter] You can still work.

00:38.330 --> 00:40.450
You just have to be careful.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.580
Why do I feel like there's
bad news coming?

00:43.620 --> 00:44.620
How's Leslie?

00:44.670 --> 00:44.870
Oh, Leslie's doing great.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.460
She's actually back to work. And
everything is looking wonderful.

00:48.500 --> 00:51.050
Is she here today?
I'd like to see her.

00:51.090 --> 00:52.470
She's not in the office.
I checked for you.

00:52.510 --> 00:54.010
See? I care about ya.

00:57.010 --> 00:57.220
What about Sloan?

00:58.680 --> 01:00.140
We never stop looking for Sloan.
And now that you're out-

01:00.180 --> 01:00.470
You can help.

01:01.560 --> 01:04.100
Wait. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

01:05.310 --> 01:05.600
We're broke.

01:06.810 --> 01:08.560
Where'd you get the
cash for that fancy-

01:08.610 --> 01:09.520
new jacket.

01:09.570 --> 01:10.570
And my bail money?

01:11.690 --> 01:14.360
Hahaha.

01:14.400 --> 01:15.610
Funny story.

01:15.650 --> 01:17.360
- Yeah.
- [Jake] Funny how?

01:17.410 --> 01:17.700
What are you laughing at?
Why are you acting weird?

01:19.120 --> 01:21.120
- You're acting weird.
- We're not acting anything.

01:21.160 --> 01:22.620
- No!
- Yes you are.

01:22.660 --> 01:23.960
Why are you acting weird?

01:25.040 --> 01:26.580
Where did you get
my bail money?

01:30.840 --> 01:33.300
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:33.340 --> 01:35.130
Carl Maher bailed you out.

01:35.840 --> 01:36.680
Yeah. That's right.

01:37.390 --> 01:38.720
I'm buying you, son.

01:38.760 --> 01:40.100
I'm buying your life.

02:09.750 --> 02:11.040
Sloan Daniels.

02:12.130 --> 02:13.380
Or should I say. Doyle?

02:14.760 --> 02:17.430
Nice to see you again
after all this time.

02:18.760 --> 02:21.350
I think we've got a lot
to talk about.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.220

03:02.090 --> 03:05.100
Somebody help me please!

03:05.140 --> 03:09.480
[phone rings]

03:15.360 --> 03:18.240
Hottie burn, Carl. That's a case
I worked for a paying client.

03:18.280 --> 03:20.240
He's paid in full.
Let's go, Doyle.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.990
Des. I told you to
put that away!

03:22.030 --> 03:22.320
Sorry.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.580
Leslie won't answer my
friggin' phone calls.

03:25.490 --> 03:25.830
[Carl]
I gotta say, copper.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.960
Your youngster over there.
He's a tad ungrateful.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.460
Thanks. I thought I
was the only one.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.830
So, this is the best you
could come up with.

03:33.880 --> 03:34.340
You're outta jail, aren't ya?

03:35.460 --> 03:35.800
Carl, What do you
want from me that-

03:37.090 --> 03:37.380
you think is with a
hundred thousand dollars?

03:38.800 --> 03:40.680
Oh, it' just a little job b'y.
Nudding too tangly.

03:41.630 --> 03:41.930
[Mal]
What's the job, Carl?

03:43.390 --> 03:45.350
And it better not have the
word "bank" in your pitch.

03:45.390 --> 03:46.310
Okay, okay, okay.

03:46.350 --> 03:48.390
I got this. So-

03:48.430 --> 03:49.600
Introductions.

03:49.640 --> 03:49.930
I think we all remember.

03:51.060 --> 03:51.350
Mr. Carl Maher was
wrongly convicted.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.560
And actually once drugged and
kidnapped the both of you.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.820
Yet Jake was the only on in
prison. Irony, right?

03:57.860 --> 04:00.030
See your hand up?
Can I see your hand up?

04:00.070 --> 04:00.990
Des.

04:01.030 --> 04:01.320
Sorry.

04:02.450 --> 04:05.070
No sense of humor.
Okay. So. Michelle

04:05.120 --> 04:07.490
Cantwell. Carl has
a beef with her.

04:07.540 --> 04:07.830
After investing

04:09.370 --> 04:11.120
an embarrassingly large sum
of money into her investment

04:11.160 --> 04:11.460
firm.
Cantwell Securities.

04:12.870 --> 04:14.290
Eight hundred grand in there.
Eight hundred grand.

04:14.330 --> 04:14.670
Why did you invest so much?

04:15.840 --> 04:17.840
I had a lot more,
but I was wasting it.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.210
I wanted to do
something smart-

04:19.250 --> 04:20.630
For a change, before
I blew it all.

04:20.670 --> 04:21.920
Then I met Michelle. And-

04:21.970 --> 04:23.510
Well, let me tell you.

04:23.550 --> 04:26.470
She got her claws into me
like nudding else.

04:27.220 --> 04:28.060
How'd you meet her?

04:29.180 --> 04:31.430
She's friends with my
sister. Crystal.

04:31.480 --> 04:31.770
Her friend.

04:33.390 --> 04:36.020
Anyways, I gave her the cash.
I couldn't stop myself, right?

04:36.060 --> 04:36.310
I haven't heard tell
of her since.

04:37.730 --> 04:39.820
She won't even call me back.
Much less- meet with me.

04:39.860 --> 04:41.530
[Jake] What do have
on this company?

04:41.570 --> 04:43.570
Cantwell Securities?
Seems to be on the up and up.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.820
Alright Carl.
I'll bite.

04:47.950 --> 04:49.120
What do you want from me?

04:49.160 --> 04:50.660
I don't want the
cops involved.

04:50.700 --> 04:52.370
And apparently you're the only
option I got

04:52.410 --> 04:53.660
to get what I needs.

04:53.710 --> 04:54.830
So if you're
done sookin'-

04:54.870 --> 04:55.830
We'll go!

05:07.300 --> 05:08.890
Are you gonna talk
nicely this time?

05:08.930 --> 05:09.810
[spit]

05:11.890 --> 05:13.100
How's that
for nice?

05:14.980 --> 05:16.810
I'm surprised you're as
brazen as you are,

05:16.850 --> 05:18.860
seeing that you're the one
that's tied to a chair.

05:18.900 --> 05:20.730
Do you get off on
tying up young girls?

05:20.770 --> 05:22.440
I don't get off on
any of this.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.360
Especially the part where you
and your loser boyfriend

05:24.400 --> 05:24.700
rob my safe.

05:26.030 --> 05:27.240
You've gotten soft, Saul.
Because what I see is a-

05:27.280 --> 05:29.160
man who got beat
by a little girl.

05:33.120 --> 05:34.500
I got you.

05:36.330 --> 05:40.090
So you tell me again.
Who beat who, here?

05:42.300 --> 05:45.130
Oh, and by the way,
we've got your boyfriend.

05:46.670 --> 05:49.510
Unfortunately, he's already
spent his half of the take.

05:49.550 --> 05:52.850
What? How do you
think we found you?

05:55.100 --> 05:56.230
Did you kill him?

05:58.230 --> 05:58.690
No.

06:00.150 --> 06:02.650
But he won't be playing that
trick again anytime soon.

06:04.490 --> 06:05.900
You're the smart one.

06:05.950 --> 06:06.400
You kept your cut.

06:07.320 --> 06:08.570
What's in that bag could cover

06:08.610 --> 06:08.950
almost everything
I took from you.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.740
You're missing the point.
You stole from me!

06:14.450 --> 06:17.210
And that kind of thing goes
way beyond the money.

06:17.250 --> 06:20.580
OK, well If you're gonna
kill me, kill me.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.040
Otherwise, just piss off.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.420
That's a big debt
for a little girl

06:23.460 --> 06:24.710
to have to carry all by herself.

06:29.300 --> 06:30.180
You see this company card?

06:31.140 --> 06:33.100
Doyle and Doyle
Investigations?

06:34.600 --> 06:35.640
That's nothing.

06:36.640 --> 06:36.980
It's just a credit card
I stole.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.310
I think we may have found
another way to sort this out.

06:49.450 --> 06:49.780
What are you doing?

06:51.070 --> 06:52.570
Nudding. I kinda been
banned from the place.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.200
They said they'd call the
cops next time.

06:55.620 --> 06:58.410
If they call the cops,
Carl, I'm gonna go to jail.

06:58.450 --> 07:01.790
If you don't shut up and do what
I say, you're going back anyway.

07:01.830 --> 07:03.000
[Michelle] You know,
this really is the

07:03.040 --> 07:04.670
perfect time to invest.

07:05.130 --> 07:06.130
Michelle!

07:08.880 --> 07:11.090
Sam, would you
excuse me for a moment?

07:11.130 --> 07:12.640
- [Sam] Yeah.
- Thank you.

07:14.560 --> 07:14.890
Carl, not again.

07:16.140 --> 07:17.470
Take it easy, my Ducky.
I'm just here to talk.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.440
Got my lawyer
with me this time.

07:19.480 --> 07:19.850
[Jake] I'm not his-

07:21.150 --> 07:23.440
lawyer. I represent-
It's complicated. Listen-

07:23.480 --> 07:25.190
About Carl's investments.
There appears

07:25.230 --> 07:26.360
to be some kind of confusion.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.570
Oh no. There's zero confusion.

07:28.610 --> 07:31.820
As I have explained
to your client-

07:31.860 --> 07:34.780
His investment is secure if he
just has a little patience.

07:34.820 --> 07:36.450
Look, I knows when I'm being
swindled, alright.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.080
Now I wants my eight
hundred thousand dollars.

07:38.120 --> 07:39.410
Or I'm putting this place up.

07:40.660 --> 07:42.790
Is there a problem
with my investment?

07:42.830 --> 07:43.290
Yes sir.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.340
No, not at all.
It's just a misunderstanding.

07:47.380 --> 07:49.590
Carl. Calm down.

07:49.630 --> 07:50.920
I'm calm.

07:50.970 --> 07:51.260
Do you have any paperwork.

07:52.510 --> 07:54.390
You know, anything that Carl
may have signed?

07:54.430 --> 07:55.800
An agreement with you.

07:55.850 --> 07:56.140
Yes. Of course.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.470
I've been trying to call her.
I've been calling you!

07:59.520 --> 07:59.810
Every day. You don't
call me back.

08:01.190 --> 08:03.560
Because I'm trying to make
you more money, Carl.

08:03.600 --> 08:05.610
He signed up for the
extended term.

08:05.650 --> 08:07.190
It's been two weeks.

08:07.940 --> 08:08.650
Two week?

08:09.940 --> 08:11.820
Did you even read this
before you signed it?

08:12.780 --> 08:14.370
Yes, I started to read it, but-

08:15.570 --> 08:17.280
I don't know. I got kinda
caught up in her.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.330
I mean, look at her, she's-
sexy, right?

08:20.410 --> 08:22.500
Sweetie.
Everything is gonna be fine.

08:22.540 --> 08:24.330
Right Sweetie.
I'll ask you one more time.

08:24.370 --> 08:25.000
Give me back my money.

08:26.290 --> 08:28.590
Just go over there.
Look, play with the pens.

08:29.960 --> 08:32.470
I know we just met, but-
I need a huge favor, okay.

08:32.510 --> 08:34.630
You would
make my life so much easier-

08:34.680 --> 08:36.640
If you could just free up some
of his cash for him.

08:36.680 --> 08:37.680
What do you say?

08:38.310 --> 08:38.720
No.

08:40.180 --> 08:42.480
When you think about it, Carl
is not such a bad fella.

08:42.520 --> 08:43.690
[gunshot]

08:43.730 --> 08:45.610
[screams]

08:47.940 --> 08:49.530
[Jake] Have you lost
your mind?

08:49.570 --> 08:50.740
No sir. Just my money.

08:51.610 --> 08:53.280
Go get it, Michelle.
Now.

08:53.320 --> 08:54.700
Carl, I can't do that.

08:54.740 --> 08:54.990
Does my sister, Crystal

08:56.120 --> 08:57.030
know what you're
doing to her brother?

08:58.830 --> 08:59.410
Get your hands off me.

09:00.120 --> 09:01.790
Get your hands off!

09:04.660 --> 09:06.250
Just get him
out of here please?

09:06.290 --> 09:08.210
I'm gonna cut you
one more break.

09:08.250 --> 09:10.710
If you come back here again,
you will go to jail.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.380
This little scam you got going?

09:12.420 --> 09:12.720
It's falling apart, Michelle.

09:14.130 --> 09:15.930
And you better hope that me
eight hundred thousand

09:15.970 --> 09:17.090
don't fall with it.

09:18.640 --> 09:23.270
Really. I'm sorry about him.
His temper flairs up sometimes.

09:29.980 --> 09:31.520
You're a bad
investment, Doyle.

09:31.570 --> 09:31.860
Well, you're not giving me
much of a chance.

09:33.190 --> 09:34.400
But I gotta say, you might
be on to something.

09:34.950 --> 09:35.910
What's that?

09:35.950 --> 09:36.200
Michelle.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.240
She's being investigated
by the Securities Commission.

09:39.280 --> 09:40.620
That's because
something's going on.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.290
Sam Pittman.

09:45.460 --> 09:46.670
Jake and Carl, right?

09:47.670 --> 09:48.920
Some crazy fireworks in there.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.130
And that's a crazy jacket.

09:50.170 --> 09:51.340
[Jake] Wait, what do you mean-

09:51.380 --> 09:52.800
Something's going on?

09:52.840 --> 09:54.840
I'll level with you.
I'm a journalist.

09:54.880 --> 09:56.800
I got a tip a while
back that some of their clients

09:56.840 --> 09:58.970
weren't getting the
returns they were promised. So-

09:59.010 --> 10:00.970
I've been posing as
a potential investor.

10:01.010 --> 10:03.010
That's exactly what
I was saying to him.

10:03.060 --> 10:03.350
Been checking the place
out ever since.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.270
There's more activity
happening here after hours,

10:06.310 --> 10:07.730
than during the day.
And guess what?

10:07.770 --> 10:08.060
[Jake] We know.

10:09.600 --> 10:10.940
They're being investigated by
the Securities Commission.

10:10.980 --> 10:11.190
How did you know?

10:12.440 --> 10:14.230
Because it says so
on this piece of paper.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.440
Yeah. They received a couple of
complaints from investors about

10:16.490 --> 10:18.950
breach of contract
involving dividends.

10:18.990 --> 10:22.120
The Commission sent
this guy to investigate.

10:22.160 --> 10:22.990
Phil Cooper.

10:24.620 --> 10:26.620
They're pretty secretive with
their ongoing investigations.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.500
But I thought maybe,
if we work together-

10:28.540 --> 10:29.750
You're a P.I. right?

10:29.790 --> 10:30.880
We could crack this.

10:30.920 --> 10:31.290
[Carl] I knows that, but-

10:32.670 --> 10:34.090
Will I get my money back?
That's all I cares about.

10:34.130 --> 10:34.420
It' still there.

10:35.760 --> 10:36.720
Either way you want to get
ahead of this thing.

10:36.760 --> 10:36.970
[phone rings]

10:38.630 --> 10:40.220
You want to be at the front of
the line to get our money back.

10:40.260 --> 10:41.140
Think about it.

10:41.180 --> 10:42.600
I gotta get this.

10:42.640 --> 10:43.600
Where's he going?

10:44.760 --> 10:47.020
- Hello?
- Don't tell my brother it's me.

10:47.060 --> 10:47.350
Okay.

10:48.310 --> 10:49.850
- Dad. - No, it's me, Crystal

10:49.900 --> 10:51.270
Maher, Carl's sister.

10:51.310 --> 10:52.820
Yeah I know, Dad.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.940
Oh! Got ya.

10:55.980 --> 10:56.240
Well, I really
need to talk to you.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.530
It's important. And you're the
only one that can help.

10:59.570 --> 11:02.200
There must be other people.

11:02.240 --> 11:03.950
Look, Carl's not telling
you everything. OK?

11:03.990 --> 11:05.490
I can clear all this up.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.040
I'll text you an address.

11:09.040 --> 11:09.920
Okay.

11:11.210 --> 11:11.500
You done?

11:12.920 --> 11:15.000
You know Dad, right? He just
wanted to yell at me.

11:15.040 --> 11:19.010
Listen. I gotta go do something.
So I'm gonna put you with Des.

11:19.050 --> 11:20.930
You two, you should come here
and stake this place out.

11:20.970 --> 11:22.390
Des? I didn't buy Des.

11:23.800 --> 11:24.140
I'm busy.

11:25.760 --> 11:28.100
And the thing that I gotta do
requires a certain amount of-

11:29.270 --> 11:30.190
finesse.

11:34.360 --> 11:34.650
What do you got?

11:36.230 --> 11:39.650
Hey. Look. Sloan just used one
of our company credit cards.

11:39.690 --> 11:41.530
She must have grabbed it from
the safe when she robbed us.

11:41.570 --> 11:44.120
What? Sloan is smarter that
that. She knew we'd find out.

11:44.160 --> 11:46.080
- Yeah, exactly.
- Something's off here.

11:46.120 --> 11:47.660
Do you think we're
being set up?

11:47.700 --> 11:50.080
Or someone's trying to get
our attention.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.540
Green Room Bar.

11:59.460 --> 12:01.010
- Crystal.
- Jake.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.340
It's been a while.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.600
Yes it has.

12:04.640 --> 12:05.810
You look good.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.680
Really good.

12:09.060 --> 12:12.100
Well, I think you're the one
who looks- you look.

12:12.140 --> 12:13.060
You look great.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.100
I know, right?

12:14.150 --> 12:15.520
It's my
cross to bear.

12:19.570 --> 12:19.900
Hehe.

12:21.190 --> 12:23.070
You wanted to tell me
something about Carl?

12:23.110 --> 12:25.200
Let's get comfy first.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.120
Uh.

12:28.450 --> 12:30.040
Do you trust me, Jakey?

12:30.080 --> 12:33.960
No. I don't. Not at all.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.130
Are you trying to steal your
brother's money again?

12:37.170 --> 12:39.210
I'm looking out for Carl.

12:39.250 --> 12:41.220
He just doesn't see that.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.510
Right. How so?

12:43.550 --> 12:47.970
I hooked Michelle and Carl up.
She's a genius.

12:48.010 --> 12:49.720
And this whole thing will
work out fine.

12:49.760 --> 12:51.520
If Carl just sits back
and waits.

12:51.560 --> 12:54.270
I don't think that Carl is
the patient type.

12:54.310 --> 12:55.480
Sit!

12:56.270 --> 12:57.650
He trusts you.

12:58.980 --> 13:02.240
You need to convince him.
You know what I mean?

13:02.280 --> 13:04.660
No, I don't.

13:06.530 --> 13:08.370
I assure you that I have it.

13:09.660 --> 13:10.620
Okay.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.080
Hi.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.330
Okay. Bye bye.

13:13.370 --> 13:15.330
You two look cozy.

13:15.370 --> 13:15.710
Please sit.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.420
Sorry about that.
Impatient investor.

13:18.460 --> 13:20.340
Well, let's hope that they don't
make a complaint

13:20.380 --> 13:22.130
to the Securities Commission.

13:22.170 --> 13:22.510
Huh.

13:23.630 --> 13:25.300
Well you really are a good
P.I. Jake.

13:25.340 --> 13:27.550
Unfortunately there are
people out there-Like Carl-

13:27.590 --> 13:30.180
Who, when they don't see a
return right away, they panic.

13:30.220 --> 13:32.350
And sometimes they even call
the Securities People.

13:33.930 --> 13:34.770
[Jake] Yeah.

13:35.520 --> 13:37.310
Michelle's brilliant.

13:37.350 --> 13:40.270
We all stands to get rich,
if we just keep our cool.

13:40.650 --> 13:40.900
We?

13:42.190 --> 13:43.610
Yeah. Crystal's taken an
interest in the company.

13:43.650 --> 13:44.820
She's one of our
newest brokers.

13:45.450 --> 13:48.620
Oh dear God.

13:48.660 --> 13:48.950
Don't look so sad.

13:50.280 --> 13:50.580
We just wanted to clear up
a few misconceptions

13:51.790 --> 13:51.990
that my brother has
about this company.

13:53.660 --> 13:55.370
[Michelle] We thought that it
would be easier to talk to you.

13:55.410 --> 13:58.250
And have you relay my assurance
that his investments are

13:58.290 --> 14:00.840
- safe and sound.
- Meaning-

14:00.880 --> 14:02.170
Look, Jake.

14:03.460 --> 14:05.720
If you wanna check my
track record, you can.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.090
But it's the best in
the business.

14:07.130 --> 14:10.140
Because I am the best
in the business.

14:10.180 --> 14:11.800
[Crystal] You should listen
to Michelle, Jake.

14:11.850 --> 14:14.100
There could be something
in this for you too.

14:14.140 --> 14:14.430
[Michelle]
It's true.

14:15.980 --> 14:19.020
You keep Carl calm, and keep
his money in the game. And-

14:19.060 --> 14:20.150
We could all profit from this.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.480
[Crystal] You could make
a good commission.

14:25.070 --> 14:28.200
Uh, meaning that you guys
wanna pay me

14:28.240 --> 14:30.070
to just keep
my mouth shut, right?

14:30.120 --> 14:32.120
- Grow up, Jake!
- Ow!

14:32.160 --> 14:34.200
Help us, or not. I don't care!
We tried to reason with you.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.750
Now we'll just take care of
it ourselves.

14:35.790 --> 14:37.160
I think you know your way out.

14:38.750 --> 14:39.210
Okay.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.420
Well, thank you for-

14:41.460 --> 14:44.670
whatever- whatever
the hell this was.

14:45.260 --> 14:47.340
[phone rings]

14:50.010 --> 14:51.890
Hey Rose. What's up?

14:51.930 --> 14:54.220
Listen. You might wanna call
your dad. He's looking for you.

14:54.260 --> 14:55.770
Is it Sloan? Did he find her?

14:55.810 --> 14:58.140
Yeah. I'm gonna text you
an address right away.

14:58.190 --> 14:59.100
That's great news.

14:59.140 --> 15:00.020
I'm on my way.

15:05.020 --> 15:05.320
[Carl]
There's no sign of anyone.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.780
This is just a waste
of time, b'y.

15:07.820 --> 15:09.660
No.
Give me them! Jeez, b'y.

15:09.700 --> 15:10.610
Sook.

15:10.660 --> 15:10.950
I'm not a sook.

15:12.450 --> 15:14.160
And this is not a waste of
time. But you know what is?

15:14.200 --> 15:17.290
Is you shooting up an
office with my flare gun.

15:17.330 --> 15:18.250
Mal is gonna kill me.

15:19.040 --> 15:19.250
This van looks different.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.500
That's because you blew
up the last one, remember?

15:22.540 --> 15:24.250
Oh yeah! Right on.

15:24.290 --> 15:26.170
Stop playing with stuff.

15:27.130 --> 15:27.420
So.

15:28.550 --> 15:30.130
You're dating the boss's
niece, are ya?

15:30.180 --> 15:31.220
What's that like?

15:31.260 --> 15:33.050
First of all, Jake's my partner.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.180
Yeah, right.

15:35.220 --> 15:35.560
He is.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.390
And secondly. Yes I am
dating her. And it's awesome.

15:39.600 --> 15:42.020
Jake's daughter, Sloan.
She must be a real-

15:42.060 --> 15:42.350
wild child, eh?

15:43.690 --> 15:46.690
Oh yeah. She's nuts.
Well, she has her moments,

15:46.730 --> 15:48.360
that normally last twenty
four hours a day.

15:48.400 --> 15:49.570
Well, she as to sleep, but-

15:49.610 --> 15:50.450
Crystal?

15:51.570 --> 15:52.740
Are you thinking
about your hot sister?

15:52.780 --> 15:52.990
Crystal's there.

15:54.280 --> 15:55.580
In your heart? Yeah,
we carry family in our-

15:55.620 --> 15:55.990
Buddy, are you stunned?

15:57.120 --> 15:59.830
Or what? She's right
there, b'y. Look.

15:59.870 --> 16:01.750
She's been avoiding me
like cracked lately.

16:01.790 --> 16:02.080
I gotta go talk to her.

16:03.330 --> 16:04.500
Last thing I needs,
is her in my business.

16:04.540 --> 16:04.840
No, no, no. I'm sorry.

16:06.380 --> 16:08.460
But Jake said, and I quote,
not to let him - that's you-

16:08.500 --> 16:10.380
Out of your - that's me-
sight. I can't.

16:10.420 --> 16:12.050
Des-
Get out of the way, buddy.

16:13.430 --> 16:13.640
Well, then, come out
with me then.

16:14.760 --> 16:15.850
I'm sorry. I can't.
It's too risky.

16:18.520 --> 16:19.430
What?

16:19.470 --> 16:21.810
Whoopsie Daisy.

16:21.850 --> 16:22.190
Des.!

16:23.270 --> 16:23.560
Uncuff me! Something's
going down.

16:24.810 --> 16:26.980
Why else would
Crystal be meeting with the

16:27.020 --> 16:28.270
Securities Commissioner fella?

16:28.320 --> 16:29.860
It's that guy,
Phil Cooper.

16:29.900 --> 16:33.200
Sure, I don't care who it is.
Uncuff me now!

16:33.240 --> 16:36.280
I'm sorry. But an extreme man
calls for extreme measures.

16:36.330 --> 16:37.240
Des!

16:37.280 --> 16:38.160
Mmm-mm.

16:41.540 --> 16:42.460
Carl.

16:42.500 --> 16:43.370
Des.

16:44.250 --> 16:45.170
It's not loaded.

16:47.670 --> 16:48.960
You had extra flares,
didn't you?

16:49.000 --> 16:49.920
Uncuff me.

16:49.960 --> 16:50.260
Okay.

16:51.300 --> 16:51.510
I don't think you're
gonna do it.

16:53.090 --> 16:56.470
Because, you'd have to be crazy
to shoot that off in here.

16:56.510 --> 16:57.760
And I don't even think
Carl Maher

16:57.800 --> 16:58.720
is crazy enough to do that.

16:58.760 --> 16:59.680
Not crazy enough, am I?

16:59.720 --> 17:00.640
No. I don't think so.

17:00.680 --> 17:02.480
No? No? Wha?

17:02.520 --> 17:03.440
[bang]

17:03.480 --> 17:04.350
Arrgh!

17:05.600 --> 17:07.900
Arrgh! The van's on fire!
The van's on fire!

17:11.400 --> 17:14.110
The keys arsehole or we're
both gonna burn to death.

17:14.150 --> 17:15.660
The van is on fire!
Oh, the keys.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.320
Calm down.
Breathe, Breathe.

17:17.370 --> 17:18.280
Okay. Okay.

17:19.990 --> 17:21.080
Faster than that b'y.

17:22.290 --> 17:23.500
Alright. Hurry up.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Oh my God!

17:36.050 --> 17:38.390
Relax out of it b'y. She'll
probably burn herself out.

17:39.550 --> 17:42.100
[explosion]

17:50.570 --> 17:51.440
[Saul]
Jake.

17:51.860 --> 17:53.190
Welcome.

17:53.240 --> 17:53.440
Where is she?

17:54.610 --> 17:55.860
He's got Sloan stashed
away somewhere.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.620
- Where?
- We'll get to that.

17:59.660 --> 18:01.080
She's safe for now.

18:01.120 --> 18:01.410
[Mal] Enough games.

18:02.450 --> 18:03.370
- Get to it.
- Before I kill you.

18:04.540 --> 18:07.080
Jake. You're in the eye
of a storm here.

18:07.120 --> 18:10.170
If I were you, I would slow
down and enjoy this moment.

18:10.210 --> 18:11.670
Because things are
gonna get bad for you.

18:11.710 --> 18:12.000
Real soon.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.340
- How do you figure?
- Well, unless you do

18:14.380 --> 18:15.800
exactly what I want,

18:15.840 --> 18:17.590
you'll be attending young
Sloan's funeral.

18:20.180 --> 18:20.510
- [kick]
- Ugh!

18:21.680 --> 18:24.180
The more damage you do to
me or my guys-

18:24.220 --> 18:25.980
the larger your tab gets.

18:26.020 --> 18:28.810
Tab? How about you tell us
where Sloan is right now.

18:28.850 --> 18:30.520
Before you find out what
I can really do.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.650
Jake, stop. What tab?
What are you talking about?

18:32.690 --> 18:34.230
She stole from me.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.110
And I'm talking a whole
lot of money.

18:36.150 --> 18:38.360
And from what I understand,
she did the same thing to you.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.360
Now, granted, she still has
some cash on her.

18:40.410 --> 18:42.910
But this isn't about the
money any more, is it?

18:42.950 --> 18:44.910
- What's your point?
- My point is, [Jake]

18:44.950 --> 18:46.660
If I kill her,
I get nothing.

18:46.700 --> 18:49.080
But if you two decide to
take on her debt,

18:49.120 --> 18:50.580
that's something
that I can consider.

18:50.630 --> 18:50.920
[Mal] You said it yourself.

18:52.420 --> 18:53.880
She took our cash as well.
We got nothing to offer you.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.300
Oh, I think you've got
a whole lot to offer.

18:56.420 --> 18:58.220
Have you heard the
term sweat equity?

18:58.260 --> 18:59.800
[Jake] Yeah, if it involves
kicking your teeth in,

19:00.890 --> 19:02.850
I'm more than happy
to contribute.

19:02.890 --> 19:04.260
you donate your time to me.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.720
Do whatever it is
I tell you to do,

19:05.770 --> 19:07.560
until Sloan's debt
to me is erased.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.480
Yeah, listen, I'm already one
psychopath's errand boy.

19:10.520 --> 19:12.610
So, I'm pretty sure
I'm at my limit.

19:12.650 --> 19:15.730
Task number one. Find out what
the cops have on me.

19:15.770 --> 19:18.900
What they know about me. Whether
I'm under any investigations.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.530
- That kind of thing.
- Are you crazy?

19:20.570 --> 19:22.530
I know you've got those
kinds of connections.

19:22.570 --> 19:24.120
So you get me that
information,

19:24.160 --> 19:24.370
and I'll let Sloan go.

19:25.700 --> 19:25.990
And then you and I will
keep this arrangement,

19:27.200 --> 19:28.290
until I feel you've
worked off her debt.

19:29.750 --> 19:32.790
Be in touch when you have
what I want. And gentlemen-

19:32.830 --> 19:35.800
You cross me, she dies.

19:41.930 --> 19:43.550
[Hood] So, are you sure we need
to be doing this?

19:43.590 --> 19:45.470
I mean, you just got
back on the job.

19:45.510 --> 19:47.600
I'm fine. Don't bring
it up again.

19:47.640 --> 19:47.850
Okay.

19:49.520 --> 19:52.190
This is pretty low level stuff,
for a couple of sergeants, no?

19:52.230 --> 19:52.520
Low level?

19:53.980 --> 19:55.980
I got good intel that this
guy's selling to children.

19:56.020 --> 19:58.030
Not teenagers, but pre-teens.

19:58.070 --> 19:59.490
Plus he's got a record that
would make you sick.

20:00.530 --> 20:01.950
So how do you want
to handle it?

20:04.910 --> 20:05.830
Do you see that?

20:07.120 --> 20:08.200
I'll call it in.

20:10.710 --> 20:11.670
Bennett.

20:12.960 --> 20:13.830
Stop, police!

20:24.390 --> 20:26.140
That kid couldn't have been
more than twelve.

20:26.180 --> 20:27.350
Money's money.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.470
[smack]

20:30.560 --> 20:31.940
Are you crazy in
the head, Lady?

20:31.980 --> 20:32.850
[kick]

20:34.060 --> 20:34.980
[punch]

20:35.020 --> 20:35.520
Oh!

20:36.190 --> 20:37.270
- [punch]
- Ugh!

20:37.320 --> 20:38.190
- [punch]
- Arrgh!

20:38.730 --> 20:39.610
Leslie!

20:40.820 --> 20:41.700
Leslie.

20:49.790 --> 20:50.080
Hey baby, what's up?

20:51.080 --> 20:52.710
What's up?
You blew up the van?

20:52.750 --> 20:54.330
Sort of.
Technically, Carl did.

20:54.370 --> 20:55.960
But that's only because
I handcuffed him.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.920
So he was forced to
set fire to it.

20:57.960 --> 20:58.250
That sounded way more
saner in my head.

20:59.840 --> 21:01.010
- Can you ask me that again?
- You could have been killed.

21:01.050 --> 21:03.170
He's a hero. He saved my life.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.970
You should make out with him
with another missus.

21:06.550 --> 21:08.300
- What?
- Carl!

21:08.350 --> 21:10.220
Unless, you know, you think
that's a good idea.

21:11.350 --> 21:11.640
I mean, Carl!

21:12.980 --> 21:15.230
It's just a suggestion, b'y.
Open minds, right?

21:15.270 --> 21:15.520
Ignore him.

21:16.940 --> 21:19.060
[Mal] I told you to put the
shaggin' flare gun away!

21:19.110 --> 21:21.190
[Jake] That's two of our vans
that you've now blown up.

21:21.230 --> 21:23.360
You see why I never want to
spend any time with you?

21:23.400 --> 21:23.700
[Carl]
Relax, b'y.

21:24.740 --> 21:24.950
As soon as you
get my money back,

21:25.860 --> 21:27.240
I'll buy you a new one, okay?

21:28.830 --> 21:29.910
I'm glad you're out.

21:29.950 --> 21:30.160
You okay?

21:31.330 --> 21:32.580
Yeah, I'm fine.
What about these two?

21:32.620 --> 21:32.870
Are they in any
real trouble?

21:34.410 --> 21:36.250
[Tinny] There's no charges to be
laid, as far as I can see.

21:36.290 --> 21:37.960
Can I press some?

21:38.000 --> 21:38.210
Please don't do that.

21:39.340 --> 21:40.380
[Tinny] They can go.
But b'ys. Just-

21:40.420 --> 21:42.090
stop blowing stuff up.

21:42.130 --> 21:43.130
Yes baby.

21:45.260 --> 21:46.340
- Fellas?
- [Jake] Des.

21:46.380 --> 21:47.050
Go away.

21:48.680 --> 21:51.850
Dad. I need to find a way to get
that information for Vic Saul.

21:51.890 --> 21:53.980
Just don't get Tinny tangled
up in this.

22:03.150 --> 22:05.610
I'll watch Tweedledum
and Tweedle Des.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.240
You do what you gotta do.

22:09.990 --> 22:10.870
Yeah.

22:17.120 --> 22:18.130
Hey, what's the story?

22:20.250 --> 22:23.420
Oh, Hurricane Jake. Of course.

22:25.260 --> 22:27.010
Could you close the
door on your way out, Hood?

22:29.640 --> 22:31.140
Sorry, I haven't been
answering your calls.

22:31.180 --> 22:33.520
It's just a lot for
me to take in.

22:34.470 --> 22:35.770
What happened to your hand?

22:38.770 --> 22:39.860
Are you okay?

22:40.940 --> 22:42.110
What' going on?

22:44.900 --> 22:46.450
I'm still having nightmares.

22:48.150 --> 22:48.450
They're pretty rampant.

22:49.910 --> 22:51.990
Do you really think you should
be back here at work?

22:52.030 --> 22:53.450
You might wanna
take some time?

22:53.490 --> 22:53.740
This coming from the man

22:55.040 --> 22:56.830
who stands accused of killing
my ex-boyfriend?

22:56.870 --> 22:57.790
What?

22:58.920 --> 22:59.250
Where did that come from?

23:00.380 --> 23:00.670
Leslie, you know I didn't
kill anyone.

23:02.090 --> 23:04.170
Yeah. I realize that, Jake.
That's not the point.

23:04.210 --> 23:04.760
What is the point?

23:06.010 --> 23:07.590
I just don't think it's a good
time for us

23:07.630 --> 23:08.970
to be spending
time together.

23:10.090 --> 23:13.300
Are you-
What? This is-

23:13.350 --> 23:16.020
exactly the right time.
What are you talking about?

23:16.060 --> 23:18.850
I wanna be there for you.
You need me.

23:18.890 --> 23:21.310
I think it's best if
we just cool it.

23:21.350 --> 23:24.520
Take some time. Wait for
things to calm down, okay?

23:26.320 --> 23:27.240
Look at me.

23:28.650 --> 23:29.610
Look at me!

23:32.160 --> 23:33.030
Why?

23:34.950 --> 23:36.490
'Cause I need to
figure out who I am,

23:36.540 --> 23:36.910
and what's happening to me.

23:38.120 --> 23:40.160
And I'm not gonna be good
to you or anyone-

23:40.210 --> 23:42.630
unless I do that sooner
rather than later. Okay?

23:43.080 --> 23:43.420
Leslie.

23:44.500 --> 23:46.710
I mean it. I need to
do this alone.

24:00.270 --> 24:01.230
Hood.

24:05.770 --> 24:07.650
At least you're good for
something.

24:16.410 --> 24:17.330
[bang]

24:17.370 --> 24:17.740
Ow!
Yes b'y.

24:18.950 --> 24:20.410
That's for handcuffing me
to a burning van.

24:20.450 --> 24:21.250
You're the one who
made it burn.

24:22.370 --> 24:22.670
[Carl] Where the hell
have you been?

24:23.790 --> 24:24.130
Yeah, where the hell have you
been!

24:25.040 --> 24:25.880
Sorry. He's a bad
influence.

24:25.920 --> 24:26.920
The van, for example.

24:26.960 --> 24:27.170
None of your business.

24:28.840 --> 24:30.590
No, it is my business, because
I owns you. You're my property.

24:30.630 --> 24:30.840
You good?

24:31.800 --> 24:33.180
Uh, I guess you
could say that.

24:33.220 --> 24:35.180
Where are we with all this?

24:35.220 --> 24:37.720
We knows that Crystal and
Michelle are in this together.

24:37.760 --> 24:39.970
[Des] Crystal does have
holdings in the company. But-

24:40.020 --> 24:41.810
what was she doing arguing
with Phil Cooper?

24:41.850 --> 24:42.190
Security Commission guy?

24:43.690 --> 24:43.980
[Rose] He just filed a report,
saying that everything at

24:45.190 --> 24:46.520
Cantwell Securities
is on the up and up

24:46.560 --> 24:47.440
[Carl] What?

24:47.480 --> 24:47.690
So my money's safe.

24:48.820 --> 24:49.110
[Jake] Doesn't make
a lot of sense.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.070
We ran into that reporter,
Sam Pittman.

24:52.110 --> 24:53.450
He said that he was
on to something.

24:53.490 --> 24:56.370
OK. Well, I did a check
on him as well.

24:56.410 --> 24:57.700
He's a reporter, alright.

24:57.740 --> 24:59.030
Freelance now,
because he's been

24:59.080 --> 25:00.580
fired from a
number of newspapers

25:00.620 --> 25:00.950
for fabricating the truth.

25:02.460 --> 25:04.040
Don't let it stand in the way
of a good story, I guess.

25:04.080 --> 25:06.000
He's been sued a couple
of times too.

25:06.040 --> 25:07.710
So you think that's just what
Sam is doing now?

25:07.750 --> 25:10.500
Maybe. Cantwell Securities
are doing really well.

25:10.550 --> 25:12.340
The Commissioner's report
verifies that.

25:12.380 --> 25:12.720
Crystal was right.

25:14.010 --> 25:16.180
But why was Crystal meeting
with Phil Cooper?

25:16.220 --> 25:17.300
- [phone message sound]
- [Carl] I don't know.

25:17.350 --> 25:18.390
I'm not the P.I.

25:21.390 --> 25:23.560
Dad, we gotta go do something.

25:23.600 --> 25:24.140
What?

25:24.730 --> 25:25.730
It's personal.

25:25.770 --> 25:26.020
We'll be back soon.

25:27.440 --> 25:29.020
[Mal] Rose. See if you can trace
this Philip Cooper.

25:29.070 --> 25:29.480
Yeah, you got it.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.740
[Carl] And I gotta talk to
Crystal. Whatever she's doing,

25:32.780 --> 25:34.400
I need her to stop.
She might ruin everything.

25:34.450 --> 25:35.780
No, no. We can't be at it.

25:35.820 --> 25:37.240
There's lots of wood
in this place.

25:37.280 --> 25:38.660
It might have survived a GREAT
fire.

25:38.700 --> 25:39.950
I wonder if it can stand
another one?

25:42.750 --> 25:43.620
I'll drive.

25:53.590 --> 25:54.510
What do we have here?

25:55.630 --> 25:57.010
It's the file the
police have on you.

25:58.260 --> 26:00.470
This is now between
you and me.

26:00.510 --> 26:00.810
You leave Sloan alone.

26:01.970 --> 26:03.680
Meaning, you never
speak to her again.

26:03.730 --> 26:05.680
Ha, ha.

26:05.730 --> 26:07.060
I don't think
you understand.

26:07.100 --> 26:07.400
You're daughter crossed me.

26:08.560 --> 26:08.860
I'm hoping you're starting
to realize-

26:10.020 --> 26:11.900
people don't do that and
get away with it.

26:11.940 --> 26:12.980
Look.

26:13.030 --> 26:13.320
I realize you're used to dealing

26:14.440 --> 26:15.990
with a certain
type of element, Saul.

26:16.030 --> 26:17.200
What do you know?

26:17.240 --> 26:17.530
Trust me.

26:18.570 --> 26:19.370
A lot more than you
think I do.

26:19.410 --> 26:20.580
[hand bangs on the bar]

26:21.240 --> 26:21.490
If we do this-

26:22.790 --> 26:24.040
The debt my daughter has
with you is now mine.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.540
She doesn't exist in
your eyes, got me?

26:27.580 --> 26:29.830
Okay. Your daughter
doesn't exist for me.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.590
Unless you screw up.

26:34.590 --> 26:36.550
This is thorough.
I'm impressed.

26:37.430 --> 26:38.340
Where is she?

26:40.180 --> 26:41.680
[Jake] If even imagine

26:41.720 --> 26:45.520
that you go
near her again, I'll kill you.

26:45.560 --> 26:48.140
Well, best keep that imagination
in check, Jake.

27:04.410 --> 27:06.620
Crystal. It's your brother.
I needs to talk to you.

27:07.620 --> 27:09.080
There's something
weird in here.

27:12.540 --> 27:13.460
Crystal!

27:14.880 --> 27:15.760
Crystal!

27:17.420 --> 27:17.720
You alright?

27:18.550 --> 27:18.760
[Crystal]
What's going on?

27:19.590 --> 27:20.430
It's all right. It's okay.

27:22.970 --> 27:24.140
But Sam isn't okay.

27:37.900 --> 27:38.990
Did Saul hurt you?

27:40.570 --> 27:41.610
No.

27:41.660 --> 27:42.530
I'm fine.

27:45.910 --> 27:46.830
You-

27:46.870 --> 27:47.750
Look, Jake.

27:51.330 --> 27:52.210
No, go ahead.

27:55.880 --> 27:56.920
I don't know what to say.

27:57.510 --> 27:58.380
Me either.

28:01.380 --> 28:02.800
I didn't mean to hurt you.

28:04.390 --> 28:06.600
You got a funny way of showing
it. Because you did hurt me.

28:06.640 --> 28:07.520
You hurt me a lot.

28:11.560 --> 28:13.770
I'm so sorry.
I really am.

28:14.860 --> 28:16.690
Not sorry enough that it
stopped you

28:16.730 --> 28:19.280
from stealing
our entire life savings.

28:19.320 --> 28:21.240
Which, by the way,

28:21.280 --> 28:24.410
we have zero chance of getting
back from insurance.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.160
Unless I press charges on you.

28:28.290 --> 28:29.700
I didn't know that part.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.250
Which I would never do,
of course.

28:31.290 --> 28:33.460
Not only because
you're my daughter.

28:35.040 --> 28:40.220
But because it will already
ruin your very fractured life.

28:44.090 --> 28:46.430
I thought they'd cover
it automatically.

28:46.470 --> 28:47.970
You know, Sloan. I don't even
care about the God damned money.

28:49.100 --> 28:49.470
I don't even care
about the fact that

28:51.060 --> 28:54.140
I'm now a slave to one of the
biggest scumbags in the city

28:54.190 --> 28:57.480
because you decided to
rob from him too.

28:57.520 --> 28:59.900
I didn't ask for any of
this from you.

28:59.940 --> 29:03.570
I didn't ask for your trust.
Or your compassion.

29:04.660 --> 29:05.950
I didn't ask for any of it.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.870
I thought that you were dead.

29:11.700 --> 29:12.830
And,

29:16.830 --> 29:19.590
I really did care
about that.

29:21.960 --> 29:25.640
I care about that a lot.

29:35.520 --> 29:37.150
I'm not going with you.

29:41.150 --> 29:42.030
Fine.

29:44.530 --> 29:46.610
I think I have to go
away from here.

29:47.410 --> 29:49.370
I don't want you to go.

29:49.410 --> 29:53.040
But- I can't force you to do
anything, obviously. So-

29:57.210 --> 29:58.840
So you do whatever you want.

30:01.460 --> 30:02.380
Okay.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.730
[Walter] So you had no idea-

30:22.780 --> 30:24.360
that Sam Pittman was
a reporter?

30:24.400 --> 30:25.780
[Crystal] No I didn't
have a clue.

30:25.820 --> 30:27.320
I thought he was a
potential client.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.740
Crystal, what's going
on with you and this

30:28.780 --> 30:30.120
Phil Cooper guy?

30:30.160 --> 30:31.740
We saw you arguing with
him earlier.

30:31.780 --> 30:33.080
What? No. He was looking for
Michelle. He said-

30:34.370 --> 30:36.250
if she didn't comply, there'd
be consequences.

30:37.920 --> 30:40.670
Look, I don't know what's going
on. But I didn't kill no one.

30:40.710 --> 30:41.000
Well?

30:42.630 --> 30:44.420
They found poison in the wine
that your sister here bought.

30:44.460 --> 30:44.760
And Sam drank.

30:45.970 --> 30:47.170
It looks like Crystal
tried to kill him.

30:47.220 --> 30:47.470
I drank it too, remember?

30:48.630 --> 30:48.890
I didn't know there was
poison in it!

30:50.180 --> 30:50.510
They're just gonna argue
that you got confused.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.470
You took a sip. It was enough
to knock you out.

30:53.510 --> 30:53.850
But it wasn't enough
to kill you.

30:55.310 --> 30:56.600
Or that you were trying to
make it look like somebody

30:56.640 --> 30:56.980
was trying to poison the
both of you.

30:58.230 --> 30:58.810
Shut your face! Shut,
shut, shut, shut up!

31:00.100 --> 31:01.810
- Who's side are you on, anyway?
- [Des] Carl.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.070
Walter's just telling
it like it is.

31:03.110 --> 31:04.860
Okay? This looks really bad.

31:05.690 --> 31:07.070
I can't go to jail.

31:07.110 --> 31:08.150
Don't worry about that.

31:09.700 --> 31:11.950
I'm your brother. I'm not gonna
let that happen. Come on.

31:11.990 --> 31:13.780
You'll take the rap for this.
You'll say that you did it.

31:13.830 --> 31:14.040
You poisoned Sam?

31:15.200 --> 31:16.790
You're the best brother
in the world.

31:16.830 --> 31:18.830
What? No, woman!

31:20.830 --> 31:22.460
But I own someone
who can fix this.

31:33.640 --> 31:34.560
Hey.

31:36.720 --> 31:37.060
Can I help you?

31:38.640 --> 31:41.020
I'm Doctor John Ronan. I was
hoping to help you, actually.

31:41.060 --> 31:41.400
- We had an appointment.
- What?

31:42.860 --> 31:44.860
I'm a psychologist. I was
assigned to you by the RNC.

31:45.900 --> 31:46.900
Oh, right.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.910
I must have missed that
email about that appointment.

31:50.950 --> 31:52.070
I got a lot going.

31:52.110 --> 31:53.030
So I've heard.

31:53.820 --> 31:56.410
Sorry. Meaning?

31:56.450 --> 31:57.910
You know these sessions
are mandatory.

31:57.950 --> 31:58.870
Yeah.

31:58.910 --> 31:59.830
So they tell me.

31:59.870 --> 32:01.920
So, may I sit?

32:04.130 --> 32:06.500
You seem to be the one
making the rules anyway.

32:07.250 --> 32:08.340
Go ahead.

32:11.170 --> 32:14.760
Sorry, I'm not usually so -
I don't know.

32:15.850 --> 32:17.140
You feeling a bit of
pressure lately?

32:18.600 --> 32:19.810
Did you read the report
about what I did

32:19.850 --> 32:21.520
to the dirt bag
drug dealer?

32:21.560 --> 32:24.020
I did. I did, yes.

32:24.060 --> 32:25.320
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

32:27.610 --> 32:27.900
Are you taking any medication?

32:29.360 --> 32:32.530
Anything to help you with the
anxiety or the stress?

32:33.820 --> 32:34.820
No.

32:36.120 --> 32:38.410
Leslie. There's no shame
to be going through

32:38.450 --> 32:38.950
what you're going through.

32:40.200 --> 32:43.880
I'm only here to help
you get through it.

32:44.500 --> 32:45.420
OK. That's all.

32:46.670 --> 32:48.380
Look, I need to be up
front with you.

32:48.420 --> 32:52.300
Good. That's actually kinda
the whole point.

32:52.340 --> 32:54.300
No. What I mean is-

32:54.340 --> 32:54.550
that I'm fine.

32:56.180 --> 32:58.220
Your time would be better spent
helping those that need it.

32:59.890 --> 33:01.390
Why don't you let me be
the judge of that?

33:02.480 --> 33:04.600
That's what they pay
me horribly for.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.610
I really appreciate
what you do.

33:06.650 --> 33:09.270
I just don't need your help.
So-

33:09.320 --> 33:10.980
If you could just check
whatever box it is

33:11.030 --> 33:11.320
you got there in that file.

33:12.860 --> 33:16.370
So that I could get back to
work, I'd be most grateful.

33:17.450 --> 33:18.660
Nice meeting you.

33:25.710 --> 33:27.830
[Carl] No, she didn't do it.
My sister wouldn't kill no one.

33:27.880 --> 33:28.130
Well, she has a motive.
Sam was a reporter.

33:29.750 --> 33:32.340
A reporter. A reporter who was
sued and fired for writing lies.

33:32.380 --> 33:33.670
[Jake] There's two clear
suspects here.

33:33.720 --> 33:35.340
Phil and Michelle.

33:35.380 --> 33:37.010
And Michelle's motive
is pretty obvious.

33:37.050 --> 33:38.890
[Rose] I think Phil's
motive is the same.

33:38.930 --> 33:41.310
Taking a closer look at the
Securities Commission document

33:41.350 --> 33:42.730
that got form
Michelle's office.

33:42.770 --> 33:43.140
And?

33:44.390 --> 33:44.690
Cantwell Securities
doesn't have holdings

33:45.940 --> 33:47.100
in half the companies
that they claim to.

33:47.150 --> 33:47.400
What?

33:49.020 --> 33:50.320
She's been sending out falsified
statements to all her clients.

33:51.030 --> 33:51.360
It's a Ponzi scheme.

33:52.610 --> 33:53.820
So Sam, for once, was
on to a legit story.

33:53.860 --> 33:54.150
I'm gonna lose all my money.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.700
Why did Phil file a report
with the Securities Commission

33:57.740 --> 33:59.370
that Cantwell was on
the up and up?

33:59.410 --> 34:01.200
Either he's incompetent,
or he's corrupt.

34:01.240 --> 34:01.450
[Des]
We saw Crystal and Phil

34:02.750 --> 34:04.500
in a pretty heated argument
before the van-

34:05.370 --> 34:07.250
seriously
blew up earlier.

34:07.290 --> 34:09.170
But Crystal said that Phil
threatened Michelle, saying that

34:09.210 --> 34:11.500
she better comply or else.

34:11.540 --> 34:14.090
I don't know. But Sam was
investigating Phil too.

34:14.130 --> 34:14.420
We gotta go talk to him.

34:15.670 --> 34:16.010
[Rose] Yeah, I got his company
credit card.

34:17.470 --> 34:19.140
I found it. I'll text you the
address to his hotel.

34:19.180 --> 34:20.720
Alright Carl. Come on. Let's
go finish this thing.

34:26.480 --> 34:28.650
Okay. Just hold on, okay!

34:30.060 --> 34:32.900
I wanna know why you pinned
the murder on my sister.

34:32.940 --> 34:33.230
What?

34:34.530 --> 34:36.450
I didn't kill anybody.
What's he talking about!

34:36.490 --> 34:37.400
- Confess.
- Carl!

34:37.450 --> 34:38.660
- Confess!
- Carl!

34:40.320 --> 34:42.120
Look. We know you falsified

34:42.160 --> 34:43.870
your Security Commission's
report on Michelle's company.

34:43.910 --> 34:45.330
No. I most certainly did not.

34:45.370 --> 34:47.580
We got your work there, look.

34:47.620 --> 34:49.080
We go it right here.

34:49.130 --> 34:50.630
[coughs]

34:51.170 --> 34:52.340
Would you -

34:54.300 --> 34:55.260
Hang on a sec.

34:55.300 --> 34:56.920
This briefcase.

34:58.010 --> 34:59.970
I saw Michelle with
this earlier.

35:08.230 --> 35:09.150
Wow.

35:10.940 --> 35:13.020
So you knew this was a
Ponzi scheme.

35:13.060 --> 35:15.150
Obviously Michelle paid you to
look the other way.

35:15.190 --> 35:17.990
Okay. I admit it. But I didn't
kill anybody, okay?

35:18.030 --> 35:18.280
[coughs]

35:19.740 --> 35:22.580
Sam was investigating you. And
you threatened Michelle.

35:23.160 --> 35:24.450
And my sister.

35:24.490 --> 35:26.330
Michelle short changed me.
Alright?

35:26.370 --> 35:28.250
That is half of what
she promised me.

35:28.290 --> 35:30.460
I told her, if she didn't
give me the rest

35:30.500 --> 35:32.170
I was going to reopen
the case.

35:32.210 --> 35:32.540
And she was gonna go down.

35:33.880 --> 35:35.840
So she agreed to give you
the rest of the money.

35:35.880 --> 35:36.880
[coughing]

35:36.920 --> 35:38.170
She was here earlier, but.

35:38.220 --> 35:41.140
[coughing]

35:46.560 --> 35:47.640
He's still breathing.

35:51.560 --> 35:52.690
There's a hole in the top.

35:55.820 --> 35:56.940
Carl, I think he was poisoned.

35:56.980 --> 35:57.240
Wha?

35:58.530 --> 35:59.610
He just said he was with
Michelle earlier, right.

35:59.650 --> 36:00.650
He needs an ambulance.

36:00.700 --> 36:00.990
Jake.

36:02.450 --> 36:03.740
You can't stay here. Otherwise
you'll go back inside.

36:03.780 --> 36:05.280
He needs to see a
doctor, Carl.

36:05.330 --> 36:06.990
You go take that stash,
and go find Michelle.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.120
And I'll wait for the cops.

36:08.160 --> 36:09.210
Go! Go!

36:11.080 --> 36:12.420
Make sure he gets
to a hospital.

36:12.460 --> 36:13.330
Yes, yes.

36:17.630 --> 36:17.840
Phil Cooper's in a coma.

36:19.470 --> 36:21.300
But he'd be dead if he finished
the water from that bottle.

36:21.340 --> 36:24.390
I saved his life. I'm a hero.
What was it? Poison?

36:24.430 --> 36:26.560
Same poison used to
kill Sam Pittman.

36:26.600 --> 36:26.930
See? My sister's innocent.

36:28.270 --> 36:29.430
Because how can she be
poisoning a second buddy?

36:29.470 --> 36:29.680
If she was already in here for

36:30.520 --> 36:32.020
poisoning the first buddy.

36:32.060 --> 36:33.850
We released her
twenty minutes ago.

36:33.900 --> 36:36.480
She's no longer a suspect
until further notice.

36:37.150 --> 36:38.110
Alright.

36:38.820 --> 36:39.820
But you might be.

36:43.360 --> 36:45.660
I told you. Michelle Cantwell
did all this.

36:45.700 --> 36:46.950
[Hood] But yet, you're
the one who just

36:46.990 --> 36:48.370
happened to be at
both scenes?

36:48.410 --> 36:49.580
We're gonna be here a while.

36:50.450 --> 36:50.710
Look.

36:52.160 --> 36:53.830
I saved that fella's life. You
just said that yourself.

36:53.870 --> 36:55.500
And ye crowd put
me in once before

36:55.540 --> 36:57.340
for something that
I didn't do.

36:57.380 --> 36:59.050
And I got some nice
settlement outta that.

36:59.090 --> 37:00.090
Wanna try again?

37:00.130 --> 37:01.220
'Cause I needs a new pool.

37:06.300 --> 37:07.390
Hello?

37:10.010 --> 37:11.980
You planning a little trip
here, Michelle?

37:13.890 --> 37:14.900
Crystal? What are you doing?

37:14.940 --> 37:15.860
Stay out of this, Jake.

37:17.270 --> 37:18.730
Cops told me it was all a scam.

37:18.770 --> 37:21.320
She stole my
brother's money!

37:21.360 --> 37:22.740
I was gonna share it with you.

37:22.780 --> 37:22.990
I swear.

37:23.900 --> 37:24.200
Well, I don't know about that.

37:25.360 --> 37:26.490
But she is gonna go
down for all this.

37:26.530 --> 37:28.030
And for murder.
Okay?

37:28.080 --> 37:29.700
You set me up.

37:29.740 --> 37:31.950
You put the poison in the
wine at my place.

37:32.000 --> 37:32.200
[Michelle]
Okay, okay, okay!

37:33.460 --> 37:35.710
Listen. Things just got
out of hand. Okay?

37:35.750 --> 37:37.710
And Sam's story would
have sunk us.

37:37.750 --> 37:39.170
And Phil, he got greedy.

37:39.210 --> 37:40.550
Crystal. Hey.

37:40.590 --> 37:41.630
Shut up, Jake!

37:41.670 --> 37:41.960
Put the knife down.

37:43.300 --> 37:44.630
You come a step closer and
I kill her, I swear.

37:44.670 --> 37:45.720
[Michelle] I can make
this right.

37:45.760 --> 37:47.260
You see that small suitcase?

37:47.300 --> 37:47.550
There's money.

37:48.800 --> 37:49.930
A million dollars cash from
other investors.

37:49.970 --> 37:51.520
- It's yours.
- Open it.

37:51.560 --> 37:52.430
Okay!

37:58.310 --> 37:58.610
See?

37:59.690 --> 38:01.570
[Carl]
Crystal! Be careful missus!

38:01.610 --> 38:02.860
I'm getting our money back.

38:03.940 --> 38:04.820
Ugh!

38:08.700 --> 38:09.580
[bang]

38:10.530 --> 38:11.870
Look out!

38:11.910 --> 38:12.790
[bang]

38:15.710 --> 38:16.920
- You okay?
- [Jake] Carl?

38:18.540 --> 38:19.670
Crystal, you okay?

38:21.550 --> 38:23.380
Don't mind me. I'm best kind.

38:30.050 --> 38:31.140
[Jake]
You okay?

38:31.850 --> 38:32.810
How's the shoulder?

38:33.680 --> 38:34.560
Good.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.940
Always knew Crystal was gonna
be the death of me.

38:37.980 --> 38:40.360
But what are you gonna do?
Family, right?

38:40.400 --> 38:40.730
I hear that.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.650
The cops found the poison at
Michelle's house.

38:43.690 --> 38:45.650
So with the murder,
and two attempted-

38:45.690 --> 38:47.610
The fraud is now the least
of her problems.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.120
You know what I feels really
sad about, though?

38:51.160 --> 38:52.080
The money?

38:52.120 --> 38:54.450
Exactly. Yeah.

38:54.490 --> 38:54.790
[Jake] What about
everything they

38:56.160 --> 38:57.330
took from Michelle's? Don't
you get any of that?

38:57.370 --> 38:57.670
Pshh. Yeah, right.

38:58.750 --> 38:58.960
[Mal]
They confiscated all of it.

39:00.130 --> 39:01.170
It'll be years before
they figure out

39:01.210 --> 39:02.340
what's what with that cash.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.050
That sucks, Carl.

39:06.010 --> 39:06.880
Although.

39:08.930 --> 39:10.180
Here.

39:12.260 --> 39:13.010
Open it.

39:13.560 --> 39:14.470
What's this?

39:14.520 --> 39:15.430
Go on.

39:19.730 --> 39:21.270
It's your eight hundred
thousand dollars.

39:21.310 --> 39:21.860
With one condition.

39:23.360 --> 39:26.110
When I'm freed and cleared of
all the murder charges.

39:26.150 --> 39:28.450
I keep the hundred thousand
dollars that you put up as bail.

39:28.490 --> 39:29.910
Yeah, right.
That's a hundred grand.

39:29.950 --> 39:30.280
You blew up our van.

39:31.700 --> 39:31.990
If you wants, we can keep the
full eight hundred.

39:33.200 --> 39:35.080
Alright. Don't get all
sooky baby out it.

39:35.870 --> 39:37.040
I'll take the deal.

39:37.080 --> 39:38.080
Stealing evidence.

39:38.120 --> 39:38.410
Are you out of your mind?

39:39.670 --> 39:40.960
It's barely evidence.
Plus I'm pretty sure

39:41.000 --> 39:43.540
this is the exact eight
hundred thousand

39:43.590 --> 39:45.050
that Carl gave Michelle
in the first place.

39:45.090 --> 39:46.170
Yeah, some of it is.

39:46.210 --> 39:47.550
Is that electrical tape?

39:47.590 --> 39:47.840
[Carl]
Hey, Jake.

39:48.970 --> 39:50.050
You knows that
Crystal's single, right?

39:51.010 --> 39:52.640
I'd be a deadly
brother in law.

39:52.680 --> 39:54.760
Yeah, that's actually kinda
what I'm afraid of.

39:55.970 --> 39:56.850
B'ys.

39:59.850 --> 40:01.020
See ya Carl.

40:05.940 --> 40:07.570
I set up a few cameras
where Sloan is staying.

40:07.610 --> 40:08.690
I haven't see her
come or go yet.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.030
Do you want me to stay on her?

40:10.950 --> 40:12.780
No. Go get some sleep.

40:12.820 --> 40:13.910
Let's leave it for tonight.

40:13.950 --> 40:14.330
You sure?

40:15.370 --> 40:15.660
She could slip away
pretty fast.

40:17.240 --> 40:19.410
Yeah, well. If that what she
wants, that's what she wants.

40:21.120 --> 40:22.630
I can't force her to
stay with us.

40:24.170 --> 40:26.710
Now, if you'll excuse me-

40:26.750 --> 40:28.800
I'm really looking forward to
getting some sleep in a room

40:28.840 --> 40:31.130
that's not filled with three
hundred hairy arsed men.

40:31.170 --> 40:33.680
Well, it's the little things in
life that make the difference.

40:35.760 --> 40:36.640
Right.

40:39.220 --> 40:41.680
Um. We're cool on
the van, right?

40:41.730 --> 40:45.060
I mean, what' done is done,
right Mal? Right? Buddy. Pal.

40:45.940 --> 40:47.730
Des, it's been my experience

40:47.770 --> 40:50.240
that the bigger man knows
when to let things go.

40:50.280 --> 40:51.150
Exactly.

40:52.990 --> 40:54.320
I'm not the bigger man.

41:29.360 --> 41:30.780
Got one of those for me?

41:32.490 --> 41:34.910
How did you know it wasn't gonna
be Des who came walking in here?

41:36.200 --> 41:38.330
How'd you know it wasn't
Des I was waiting for?

41:39.370 --> 41:40.790
Oh my God. I missed you.

42:00.720 --> 42:01.850
Cheers.

42:01.890 --> 42:02.770
Hey Dezzy!

42:03.680 --> 42:04.600
Oh Dear.

42:09.900 --> 42:12.070
Ahhh!
