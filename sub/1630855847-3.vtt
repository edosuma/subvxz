00:05.130 --> 00:05.588
[ominous music]

00:07.882 --> 00:08.967
- You're forgetting one.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.344
- One what?
- Present.

00:11.386 --> 00:13.680
The most important present.

00:13.722 --> 00:20.687
* *

00:20.729 --> 00:23.690
I took her for you.

00:23.732 --> 00:27.152
[suspenseful music]

[door slams]

00:29.404 --> 00:31.114
[footsteps approaching]

00:31.156 --> 00:32.532
- Take it back.

00:32.574 --> 00:33.742
- Take what back?

00:33.783 --> 00:35.410
- I said that I was lonely.

00:35.452 --> 00:38.830
That did not mean that I wanted
you to kidnap someone--

00:38.872 --> 00:41.374
another child--for me?

00:41.416 --> 00:43.668
I would never, ever, ever--

00:43.710 --> 00:47.714
- If it makes you feel better,
it wasn't easy for you to ask.

00:47.756 --> 00:52.719
- I remember every moment
of that year,

00:52.761 --> 00:56.973
every dark, suffocating,

00:57.015 --> 00:59.142
agonizing moment.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.936
- Distorting the truth
for one's own protection

01:01.978 --> 01:03.605
is a basic human instinct.

01:03.646 --> 01:05.774
So if you'd rather
not remember,

01:05.815 --> 01:08.068
I understand.

01:08.109 --> 01:11.071
[soft dramatic music]

01:11.112 --> 01:13.073
* *

01:13.114 --> 01:15.450
- I wanna remember.

01:15.492 --> 01:20.038
["Come Fly With Me" fades in]

01:20.080 --> 01:22.582
- It was a lovely evening.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.250
Our favorite song was playing.

01:24.292 --> 01:25.877
[chuckles]

01:25.919 --> 01:30.423
Some argue that Sartre's work
is inherently dangerous.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.592
Unchecked among the youth,
nihilism can lead

01:32.634 --> 01:34.260
to disastrous consequences.

01:34.302 --> 01:37.138
I mean, just look
at Holden Caulfield.

01:38.139 --> 01:39.599
Gabrielle.

01:39.641 --> 01:43.019
I remember you were
distracted that day.

01:43.061 --> 01:46.606
You seem...foggy lately.

01:48.149 --> 01:49.901
- I'm sorry.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.111
- No.

01:51.152 --> 01:53.113
I should
be the one apologizing.

01:53.154 --> 01:54.447
I mean, it's like you said,

01:54.489 --> 01:57.867
intellectual rigor
requires exchange.

01:57.909 --> 02:00.161
And things have been
so busy with my work,

02:00.203 --> 02:03.790
I haven't been able to spend as
much time at home as I'd like.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.166
[sighs]

02:05.208 --> 02:08.253
Perhaps you'd like a companion,

02:08.294 --> 02:11.131
someone who's with you
all the time.

02:11.172 --> 02:12.716
[eerie music]

Would you like a friend?

02:14.884 --> 02:17.262

02:17.303 --> 02:19.389
- You would...

02:19.431 --> 02:21.266
bring someone here?

02:23.435 --> 02:24.811
- You have two seconds
to decide,

02:24.853 --> 02:27.814
and then the offer's
off the table forever.

02:27.856 --> 02:34.863

02:36.281 --> 02:37.699
- Yes.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.413
Yes.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.792
I'd like a friend.

02:49.461 --> 02:51.004
- I'll bring dessert.

03:04.976 --> 03:07.729
- I took her for you.

03:09.773 --> 03:11.232
[ringing stops]

03:12.567 --> 03:13.902
- Hey.
You all right?

03:13.943 --> 03:15.612
- Never better. What's up?
- New client.

03:15.653 --> 03:16.946
Uh, there's a doorman
at a building in Dupont

03:16.988 --> 03:18.239
who thinks one
of the elderly residents,

03:18.281 --> 03:19.657
Reggie Moore, has disappeared.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.076
He's been gone for two days.
- And that's

03:21.117 --> 03:22.077
out of character for him.
- Yeah.

03:22.118 --> 03:24.537
Very much so.

03:24.579 --> 03:27.582
Um, you sure you're all right?

03:27.624 --> 03:29.542
- Talk to me about the doorman.
Body language?

03:29.584 --> 03:31.211
- He's very polite,
distinguished,

03:31.252 --> 03:32.545
deeply concerned
for this resident.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.339
- Odd that the doorman
is reporting him.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.424
Where's the family?
- Hey.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.009
I'm sorry.
I was coming through the door,

03:38.051 --> 03:39.511
and she just barged in.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.054
- May we help you?

03:41.096 --> 03:42.555
[soft dramatic music]

03:42.597 --> 03:47.477
- Gabi...
this is my daughter, Taylor.

03:48.561 --> 03:51.314
- I just need you
to sign these.

03:52.899 --> 03:55.610
- Emancipation papers?
- Yeah.

03:55.652 --> 03:58.238
I don't want you
to be my mother anymore.

03:58.279 --> 04:01.324

04:01.366 --> 04:03.743
- I've worked
at the Dupont North

04:03.785 --> 04:06.579
almost as long
as Reggie's lived there.

04:06.621 --> 04:10.208
We talk every day,
but after one day...

04:10.250 --> 04:12.085
- Oh, you're so grown-up.

04:12.127 --> 04:14.004
[relieved laugh]
Okay.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.465
- I wasn't trying
to make you look bad

04:17.507 --> 04:18.842
in front of your coworkers.

04:18.883 --> 04:21.636
- [sighs]
You know, when you were four,

04:21.678 --> 04:23.596
you declared in front
of everyone at the supermarket

04:23.638 --> 04:25.765
that you weren't gonna
eat animals anymore.

04:25.807 --> 04:29.102
So I mean,
public declarations imbue us

04:29.144 --> 04:33.606
with the strength to do
what we have to do.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.066
- You remember that?

04:35.108 --> 04:36.776
- Yeah.

04:36.818 --> 04:40.155
And I know it's been...
ten years

04:40.196 --> 04:42.282
since we've seen each other,

04:42.323 --> 04:44.993
but you're my child, Taylor.

04:45.035 --> 04:47.954
I--I remember
everything about you.

04:47.996 --> 04:51.207
* *

04:51.249 --> 04:54.461
So why now?

04:54.502 --> 04:56.629
- If you terminate
your parental rights,

04:56.671 --> 04:59.007
I qualify for
my full financial aid.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.178
- Well, I--I have savings.
I could help you--

05:03.219 --> 05:06.348
- I just want you to sign.

05:06.389 --> 05:09.976
- The two--Ms. Mosely,
are you listening?

05:10.018 --> 05:11.311
- I'm listening, Cliff.

05:11.353 --> 05:12.604
The last time you saw Reggie,

05:12.645 --> 05:14.481
he was going
on his usual coffee run,

05:14.522 --> 05:15.565
newspaper in hand.

05:15.607 --> 05:16.816
He was wearing navy slacks,

05:16.858 --> 05:18.485
a forest green
button-down shirt,

05:18.526 --> 05:19.569
a navy fedora.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.154
He carried his blazer with him

05:21.196 --> 05:23.656
because the coffee shop
is always a little chilly.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.909
- You know anything
about Reggie's personal life,

05:25.950 --> 05:28.161
his friends,
romantic relationships?

05:28.203 --> 05:29.996
- He's a bit of a loner.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.331
It's his personality.

05:31.373 --> 05:33.166
He was a music teacher,

05:33.208 --> 05:35.543
very creative.

05:35.585 --> 05:38.338
But ever since
his husband died,

05:38.380 --> 05:41.675
he's cocooned himself
even more.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.468
He loves his routines.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.345
I think they're
his saving grace.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.847
- You don't think Reggie just
took a trip on a whim?

05:47.889 --> 05:49.933
- Oh, no, that's just not him.

05:49.974 --> 05:52.268
He always tells me
in case there's a, uh,

05:52.310 --> 05:53.895
delivery or something.

05:56.398 --> 05:59.484
Uh, this is Reggie.

05:59.526 --> 06:03.321
[soft violin music playing]

06:03.363 --> 06:06.324
- Chopin, Nocturne No. 2.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.868
- Yes, in E flat.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.453
[chuckles]

06:10.495 --> 06:12.706
- My dad played.
- Ah.

06:12.747 --> 06:15.125
- Why haven't you reported
Reggie's disappearance

06:15.166 --> 06:16.835
to the police?

06:16.876 --> 06:19.379
- I read about you, Ms. Mosely.

06:19.421 --> 06:22.215
And I know you care
for everyone.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.884
I'm just not confident
the police would care

06:24.926 --> 06:28.722
about a missing gay,
Black widower in his 70s.

06:28.763 --> 06:31.808
And it's only been two days,
and my only real evidence

06:31.850 --> 06:34.894
is the absence
of our morning conversations.

06:34.936 --> 06:38.565
They'd probably
laugh me out of there.

06:38.606 --> 06:41.359
Most of the residents
don't look me in the eye

06:41.401 --> 06:45.238
when I open the door for them
or deliver their food

06:45.280 --> 06:48.199
or dry cleaning.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.326
Reggie sees me.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.996
He's a good person.

06:55.331 --> 06:58.877
Can you help find Reggie?

06:58.918 --> 06:59.711
- We will.

06:59.753 --> 07:03.923
[ethereal choral music]

07:03.965 --> 07:06.259
- No socials, but we're
building what we can.

07:06.301 --> 07:07.844
He did a lot in person.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.262
- Who was that woman
Margaret walked out?

07:09.304 --> 07:10.680
- Mind your business.

07:10.722 --> 07:12.098
- Spoke to Reggie's
only living relative.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.933
Her name's Hollis Moore.
She's Reggie's niece.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.227
She claims Reggie's fine.
They texted this morning.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.228
- What'd they text about?

07:17.270 --> 07:18.438
- See for yourself.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.939
Dhan's got screenshots.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.608
- Reggie's husband died
last year.

07:21.649 --> 07:22.942
He was so devastated,
he couldn't function.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.778
Hollis took over his finances.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.404
She's on her way to Reggie's
apartment to check on him.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.199
- Well, hopefully he is fine,
but as we always say...

07:29.240 --> 07:31.242
all: We believe
until proven otherwise.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.620
- Zeke, I want everything
there is on Reggie.

07:33.661 --> 07:34.996
I mean everything.
- Already on it.

- Dhan, we need to beat Hollis
over to Reggie's apartment

07:39.793 --> 07:41.169
before she touches anything.

07:41.211 --> 07:43.213
- I'll get the car.

07:43.254 --> 07:46.800
- I took Bella for you.

07:46.841 --> 07:47.801
- No. Wait for Margaret.

07:47.842 --> 07:49.344
Meet us at Reggie's.

Hollis?

08:01.648 --> 08:03.233
I'm crisis manager Gabi Mosely.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.360
You met with my associate,
Dhan, here.

08:05.402 --> 08:06.986
- I told him my uncle was fine.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.571
- We just need to confirm that.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.073
Once we do, you can go on
with your life.

08:10.115 --> 08:12.117
May we come in?

08:12.158 --> 08:13.827
- I guess.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.579
- So you told Dhan
that you were texting

08:16.621 --> 08:17.956
with your uncle with morning?

08:17.997 --> 08:19.708
- I need to pay
his electric bill.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.584
He's a techno hater,
but I'm slowly

08:21.626 --> 08:23.795
ushering him
into the 21st century.

08:23.837 --> 08:27.674
- When's the last time
you actually saw your uncle?

08:27.716 --> 08:31.219
- Um...let me think.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.638
- When's the last time
you actually talked to him,

08:33.680 --> 08:35.765
not texting, not typing?

08:37.142 --> 08:38.977
- Uh, let me check.

08:40.687 --> 08:47.902
* *

08:52.866 --> 08:54.659
- My husband and I went
to that bridge.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.202
- Wait, did the Dhan Rana just

08:56.244 --> 08:58.246
volunteer
personal information?

08:58.288 --> 09:01.541
- [chuckles]
Volunteer is a strong word.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.293
Nothing looks suspicious.

09:03.335 --> 09:05.378
- We need Margaret.

09:05.420 --> 09:07.255
- I'm here.

09:07.297 --> 09:09.424
Lacey's downstairs talking
to some of the residents,

09:09.466 --> 09:11.217
so I'll get started.

09:11.259 --> 09:16.848
* *

09:16.890 --> 09:19.100
- Did Reggie and Chris have
a lot of friends?

09:19.142 --> 09:20.393
- Oh, yeah, lots.

09:20.435 --> 09:23.396
- Actually, they kept
quite a small circle.

09:23.438 --> 09:24.939
When Chris passed away,

09:24.981 --> 09:26.816
Reggie just didn't
keep contact.

09:26.858 --> 09:28.360
- 'Cause he was grieving.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.527
- He told me that they were

09:29.569 --> 09:30.862
mostly Chris' friends,

09:30.904 --> 09:33.740
and they could be a bit...
obnoxious.

09:33.782 --> 09:36.034
- Sounds like he was lonely?

09:36.076 --> 09:37.410
- No. He has me.

09:37.452 --> 09:39.871
- Respectfully, miss,
your uncle was lonely.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.457
- Did Reggie have
any quarrels lately?

09:42.499 --> 09:43.875
- God, no.
I mean, look,

09:43.917 --> 09:45.669
my uncle can be prickly, okay?

09:45.710 --> 09:47.587
It's a vibe.
But enemies?

09:47.629 --> 09:50.090
No. He's just an old man.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.758
- What about neighbors,
problems there?

09:51.800 --> 09:54.427
- Oh, Reggie would complain

09:54.469 --> 09:55.970
about a dog's incessant yapping

09:56.012 --> 09:57.931
or a party
that went past 10:00,

09:57.972 --> 10:01.601
but the residents, they--
they got used to it.

10:01.643 --> 10:03.061
- Yeah.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.771
- I don't believe any
of them would do harm.

10:04.813 --> 10:06.981
- How long has Reggie been
taking ACE inhibitors?

10:07.023 --> 10:08.775
Heart medication.
- I--I don't know.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.235
- I mean,
according to his dosage,

10:10.276 --> 10:11.820
if he goes without them
for over 72 hours,

10:11.861 --> 10:13.113
he'll likely have
a heart attack.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.948
- Reggie's been gone for
two days already.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.741
- You mean, he could die?

10:16.783 --> 10:18.284
- Uh, Hollis, text your uncle,

10:18.326 --> 10:20.286
tell him you need to meet him
at 14th and U right now.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.538
Tell him it's important.

10:21.579 --> 10:26.918
* *

10:26.960 --> 10:30.130
- He says he can't make it
because he's staying home.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.841
- But we're in his home,
so that means...

10:32.882 --> 10:34.634
- We're texting
with the kidnappers.

10:34.676 --> 10:37.303
* *

10:41.474 --> 10:41.850
.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.226
- Sorry, Gabi, I was hoping
I'd have more on Reggie

10:44.894 --> 10:46.438
by now, but there really isn't
much of a profile to build.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.939
Reggie doesn't even
online shop.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.315
- But he has
a smartphone, right?

10:49.357 --> 10:50.525
- According to
the serial number,

10:50.567 --> 10:51.693
it's 15 years old.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.111
I haven't found a way in yet.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.237
Be easier if
I had the actual phone.

10:54.279 --> 10:55.947
- Zeke the Great struck out?

10:55.989 --> 10:57.282
- Yeah, first time
for everything, I guess.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.034
- Oh, y'all got jokes. Okay.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.994
- People live their lives
almost entirely online.

11:01.036 --> 11:03.288
I mean,
how does Reggie even manage?

11:03.329 --> 11:05.457
- The old-fashioned way,
in person errands.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.126
- Who has time for that?
- A lot of the elderly.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.378
The server,
the grocery store worker,

11:10.420 --> 11:13.006
the guy at the coffee shop
all become their friends.

11:13.048 --> 11:14.591
Oftentime, their only friends.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.843
- Man, loneliness is a bitch.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.387
Okay, so what's next?

11:19.429 --> 11:21.598
Press conference?
- I want Reggie's photo out

11:21.639 --> 11:23.600
to every hospital in the area.

11:23.641 --> 11:26.394
And no, we gonna keep
the press out of this for now.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.564
We don't wanna spook
the kidnappers.

11:29.606 --> 11:32.734
They think they've
successfully fooled Hollis.

11:32.776 --> 11:33.902
- And the cops?

11:33.943 --> 11:35.653
- That's a no for now too.

11:35.695 --> 11:40.992
- Uh, okay, well, I kind of
may have already called Trent.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.827
What?
We always call Trent.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.330
I was just trying
to be helpful.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.290
- Not happy to see me.

11:47.332 --> 11:49.250
- Not when I didn't send
for you.

11:49.292 --> 11:53.296
- So, uh, DCPD should have
a CMA issued shortly.

11:53.338 --> 11:55.382
- A critical missing alert?
That's like an AMBER Alert,

11:55.423 --> 11:57.008
but for senior citizens, right?

11:57.050 --> 11:58.551
- Cancel it, Trent.
Any public attention

11:58.593 --> 11:59.844
right now could
get Reggie killed.

11:59.886 --> 12:00.845
- I'm not asking.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.013
This is police protocol.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.056
- You hard of hearing?

12:03.098 --> 12:04.391
She said no CMA.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.351
- I'm sorry,
am I talking to you?

12:06.393 --> 12:08.645
- Enough. This is
our private case, Trent.

12:08.687 --> 12:10.855
Reggie hasn't been reported
missing to the police.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.482
So right now, I'm in charge.

12:12.524 --> 12:15.110
You wanna help,
triangulate the phone.

12:16.027 --> 12:17.320
- All right, Zeke,

12:17.362 --> 12:19.823
send me what you have
on the phone.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.866
- Zeke, Reggie may be offline,

12:21.908 --> 12:23.034
but his service providers
are not.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.620
There has
to be a trail somewhere.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.539
Dhan, go over
to Hollis' apartment,

12:27.580 --> 12:29.541
and stay by her side.
- Protection or surveillance?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.292
- Both.
And I need copies of the texts

12:31.334 --> 12:33.753
between her and the kidnappers
sent to me in real time.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.213
- I'm gonna call
Reggie's doctor,

12:35.255 --> 12:36.673
see if another prescription
wasn't called in.

12:36.715 --> 12:39.217
- We have one day
until Reggie's heart fails.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.052
Give me something I can use.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.888
[tense music]

12:43.930 --> 12:46.182
* *

12:46.224 --> 12:47.934
- Okay.
Well, thank you, doctor.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.228
All right, Reggie didn't send
in for another prescription.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.731
The only bottle of meds
is the one at his house.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.065
His doctor is worried too.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.775
I mean,
Reggie's heart can't sustain

12:55.817 --> 12:57.193
without those meds.

12:57.235 --> 12:59.654
- Okay, I'll--I'll tell Gabi.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.073
Hey, do you have a sec--

13:02.115 --> 13:03.074
- I know what you're gonna ask,

13:03.116 --> 13:04.701
and I'm fine.

13:04.743 --> 13:06.244
- Actually, that was gonna be

13:06.286 --> 13:08.204
about me not being fine,

13:08.246 --> 13:11.082
but, uh, you go first.

13:19.632 --> 13:23.720
- The young woman
I was talking to earlier...

13:23.762 --> 13:26.473
is my daughter.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.267
Yeah. I know.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.935
[soft dramatic music]

13:30.977 --> 13:33.980
The abridged version is she
wants to emancipate from me,

13:34.022 --> 13:35.982
and I am dealing with it.

13:36.024 --> 13:38.818
- Whoa.
Okay, um,

13:38.860 --> 13:41.279
first, you don't have
to deal with it on your own.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.781
And second,
are you really gonna sign

13:42.822 --> 13:44.240
the emancipation docs?

13:44.282 --> 13:45.909
- She's never asked me
for anything before.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.285
It's the least I can do.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.495
I mean, I haven't
been Taylor's mom

13:48.536 --> 13:50.121
for a long time,

13:50.163 --> 13:51.456
not since Jamie went missing.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.541
- Emancipation is permanent,
Margaret.

13:53.583 --> 13:54.501
- I'm aware.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.127
- Did her dad put her up
to this?

13:56.169 --> 13:57.462
- I doubt it.
I mean,

13:57.504 --> 13:59.589
Taylor's always been
really headstrong.

13:59.631 --> 14:00.674
[chuckles]

14:02.384 --> 14:04.594
And Darryl's not a bad person.

14:04.636 --> 14:06.346
The reason he went
for full custody of the kids

14:06.388 --> 14:09.808
was because he saw...

14:09.849 --> 14:11.643
what I couldn't,

14:11.685 --> 14:16.147
that my inability to stop
looking for Jamie was...

14:16.189 --> 14:19.359
hurting our other kids more.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.156
Distance and time
brings clarity.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.784
So Darryl made the right call.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.202
I mean, they didn't just
lose Jamie that day.

14:29.244 --> 14:31.454
They lost me too.

14:31.496 --> 14:36.376
And no child should ever
have to go through that.

14:37.836 --> 14:40.005
- How many?

14:40.046 --> 14:42.257
Children.

14:44.092 --> 14:48.013
- [sighs]
Taylor, Rachel, and Jamie.

14:48.054 --> 14:54.686
* *

14:54.728 --> 14:57.689
- You'll always be
their mother.

14:57.731 --> 15:01.860
And you did the best you could
at the time.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.529
Let go of the shame, Margaret.

15:07.615 --> 15:10.827
- [exhales deeply]

15:10.869 --> 15:14.205
- But, um, before you end
your parental rights,

15:14.247 --> 15:17.208
just let me look
at the documents,

15:17.250 --> 15:19.336
just give it a legal once-over.

15:22.464 --> 15:25.300
- Uh, sorry,
do you still need to talk?

15:34.642 --> 15:36.478
[knock on door]

15:36.519 --> 15:38.063
- Figured Hollis would
be safest here.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.564
Stashed her in a back office.
- Good.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.358
I think whoever abducted Reggie

15:41.399 --> 15:42.734
is younger than him
by a few decades.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.903
- You think he was taken
by a millennial?

15:44.944 --> 15:45.987
- Give or take. Look.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.322
His messages from a month ago

15:47.364 --> 15:48.990
are all complete sentences.

15:49.032 --> 15:50.408
Perfect grammar.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.285
He's a meticulous man.

15:52.327 --> 15:55.955
But these, all one-word
responses and text speak.

15:55.997 --> 15:57.582
Sloppy punctuation.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.543
Even spells "okay" differently,
no A-Y.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.384
Did you know
she had a daughter?

16:07.425 --> 16:08.927
- She has two actually.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.428
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.680
- She never mentioned that
when we took her on

16:11.721 --> 16:13.390
as a client
at the Iris PI firm.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.141
- You and I were tasked
with finding her son.

16:15.183 --> 16:17.352
Part of that meant digging
into Margaret's background.

16:17.394 --> 16:19.270
That's how I found out.
- All these years,

16:19.312 --> 16:20.814
and you never said anything.

16:20.855 --> 16:22.857
You really are a vault
for other people's secrets.

16:22.899 --> 16:24.818
- Thankfully,
I'm good at keeping them.

16:26.903 --> 16:28.279
- Hey.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.615
Zeke found something
in Reggie's bank records.

16:30.657 --> 16:37.455
* *

16:38.832 --> 16:40.542
- If you have any trouble
with those accounts,

16:40.583 --> 16:41.918
just give me a call.
You should be all set though.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.545
All right?
Take care.

16:46.423 --> 16:48.299
- Gabi Mosely.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.885
Wow.
I'm a--I'm a big fan.

16:50.927 --> 16:54.055
- Well, thank you, Julian.

16:54.097 --> 16:57.058
- Uh, so what kind of account
can I open for you today?

16:57.100 --> 16:59.602
- Actually, we're here
regarding Reggie Moore.

16:59.644 --> 17:01.229
May we ask you some questions?

17:01.271 --> 17:02.355
- Of course.

17:02.397 --> 17:03.565
Oh, God, right.

17:03.606 --> 17:05.316
You--you find missing people,

17:05.358 --> 17:06.985
so d-does that mean, uh--

17:07.027 --> 17:08.945
- Uh, let's not panic yet.

17:08.987 --> 17:13.074
Reggie may be on vacation
in Jamaica, for all we know.

17:13.116 --> 17:15.910
- Well, uh,

17:15.952 --> 17:16.995
I love Reggie.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.496
Uh, he comes in every Monday,

17:18.538 --> 17:19.956
picks up some cash
for the week.

17:19.998 --> 17:21.499
We chat it up.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.085
Uh, he's a big Whitney Houston
fan, just like me.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.713
- No way. So am I.

17:26.755 --> 17:30.008
I'd sing for you now,
but that's not my gift.

17:30.050 --> 17:32.344
[laughter]

17:32.385 --> 17:36.348
So we believe there may be
some unusual activity

17:36.389 --> 17:38.600
in Reggie's accounts,
a recent uptick

17:38.641 --> 17:42.103
of $5,000 withdrawals,
specifically.

17:42.145 --> 17:43.813
- You are good.

17:43.855 --> 17:47.567
So you must know about
his niece, Hollis, then?

17:47.609 --> 17:48.902
- Hollis?

17:48.943 --> 17:52.030
So his niece is the one
taking money from Reggie?

17:52.072 --> 17:53.907
- Stealing the money.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.243
If Reggie's in trouble,

17:57.285 --> 17:59.662
Hollis might be the reason.

17:59.704 --> 18:01.873
- That's a serious accusation.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.333
- Backed up with proof.

18:03.375 --> 18:08.338
You remember those $5,000
transfers you mentioned?

18:09.464 --> 18:12.634
They all started shortly
after his husband passed

18:12.676 --> 18:14.386
and were sent
into different accounts,

18:14.427 --> 18:15.720
all under Reggie's name,

18:15.762 --> 18:17.555
none of which Reggie knew
anything about.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.600
- Hollis took over handling
most of Reggie's finances

18:20.642 --> 18:21.976
during the same time.

18:22.018 --> 18:23.728
- Exactly.
She's the only other person

18:23.770 --> 18:25.730
that could open an account
in Reggie's name.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.525
- What's the protocol when
a customer's funds go missing?

18:28.566 --> 18:30.068
- Well, we take it
very seriously.

18:30.110 --> 18:32.862
Uh, we launch a full-scale
branch investigation.

18:32.904 --> 18:34.406
That's actually
how we determined

18:34.447 --> 18:35.740
that it was his niece.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.034
So two days ago,
I met with Reggie,

18:38.076 --> 18:40.787
and we had
the unfortunate conversation.

18:40.829 --> 18:43.748
- Right around the time
Reggie went missing.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.917
- He was devastated
when I told him.

18:45.959 --> 18:47.669
Poor guy.

18:47.711 --> 18:49.921
- You have any surveillance
footage from that day?

18:49.963 --> 18:55.176
- Uh, sharing bank footage,
uh, is against policy.

18:55.218 --> 18:56.553
You'd need a warrant for that.

18:56.594 --> 18:58.430
- But if something were wrong,

18:58.471 --> 19:01.516
do you wanna be the hero
who helped save Reggie

19:01.558 --> 19:03.476
or the banker who put protocol

19:03.518 --> 19:05.895
above a Black, gay elder?

19:05.937 --> 19:07.647
From a PR point of view,

19:07.689 --> 19:09.983
I'd choose the former.

19:10.025 --> 19:11.693
* *

19:11.735 --> 19:13.778
If Hollis really is stealing
money from Reggie,

19:13.820 --> 19:15.864
and he confronted her,
that's motive and opportunity.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.615
- She could've hurt him,
or she's holding him somewhere.

19:17.657 --> 19:18.867
- It's Trent.
He's got a lock on the phone.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.535
He's pulling up outside.
Okay,

19:20.577 --> 19:22.328
get this security video
over to Zeke

19:22.370 --> 19:23.455
and call Margaret and Lacey.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.123
Under no circumstances are they

19:25.165 --> 19:27.083
to let Hollis leave our office.

19:27.917 --> 19:30.337
- All right.
That's the phone.

19:30.378 --> 19:33.631
The minute it steps outside,
we will grab whoever has it.

19:33.673 --> 19:34.966
- Or we could just
bust in there and forget

19:35.008 --> 19:36.760
whatever warrant
you're waiting for.

19:36.801 --> 19:39.429
- See, this is exactly why

19:39.471 --> 19:41.723
I didn't just
tell you the address.

19:41.765 --> 19:43.016
- What's a little
breaking the law

19:43.058 --> 19:45.268
when you're saving
someone's life?

19:45.310 --> 19:46.353
[device beeping]

19:46.394 --> 19:47.645
Reggie's phone is on the move.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.190
- It's on the other side
of that lot.

19:50.231 --> 19:51.608
Ready?
- Yeah.

19:51.649 --> 19:54.819
[suspenseful music]

19:54.861 --> 19:56.154
* *

19:56.196 --> 19:58.198
- Ugh.
I can't get in.

19:58.239 --> 20:05.288
* *

20:05.538 --> 20:07.540
Gabi, Gabi.

20:09.501 --> 20:10.543
DCPD!

20:10.585 --> 20:12.420
I need you to back up slowly.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.339
Get on your knees,
hands behind your head.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.423
- If this tracker is right,

20:15.465 --> 20:16.716
the phone is in the dumpster.

20:16.758 --> 20:18.134
- Reggie could be too.

20:18.176 --> 20:20.387
* *

20:24.349 --> 20:24.724
.

20:24.766 --> 20:25.350
[suspenseful music]

20:26.685 --> 20:29.270
- The kidnapper must've
dropped it.

20:29.312 --> 20:31.231
Oh, thank God.

20:32.482 --> 20:33.775
- There's no way
into this phone,

20:33.817 --> 20:35.777
not unless you've
got a time machine,

20:35.819 --> 20:37.112
genie in a lamp maybe.

20:37.153 --> 20:39.155
- So we lost our only way
of communicating

20:39.197 --> 20:40.865
with the kidnappers
and tracking Reggie?

20:40.907 --> 20:42.701
- Unless the kidnapper's
in our back office

20:42.742 --> 20:44.285
under Dhan's watch.

20:44.327 --> 20:49.791
* *

20:49.833 --> 20:51.626
Look at Reggie
in this security video.

20:51.668 --> 20:53.128
It doesn't take
a lip reader to see

20:53.169 --> 20:55.380
that Reggie was devastated
learning about Hollis.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.674
- And she's been here, so she
couldn't have dumped the phone.

20:57.716 --> 20:59.092
Accomplice?

20:59.134 --> 21:02.637
- Well, this might help
give us answers.

21:02.679 --> 21:04.639
All right, printouts
of every text message

21:04.681 --> 21:06.182
Reggie's sent
in the last two months.

21:06.224 --> 21:07.809
Zeke, copies are headed
to you too.

21:07.851 --> 21:09.144
- All right, everyone,
get to reading.

21:09.185 --> 21:11.104
I'll be back
in the office in ten.

21:13.023 --> 21:15.275
- Guys, real quick,
last month,

21:15.316 --> 21:16.818
Hollis posted a FundMeOn

21:16.860 --> 21:18.862
for some unexpected
car repairs.

21:18.903 --> 21:20.947
But I checked
her DMV files and--

21:20.989 --> 21:22.532
- I'll pretend
I didn't hear that.

21:22.574 --> 21:24.242
- She doesn't own a car,
does she?

21:24.284 --> 21:26.286
- She raised two grand
for a nonexistent car,

21:26.327 --> 21:28.621
and two days later,
she was thottin' on the beach

21:28.663 --> 21:30.498
in Atlantic City.
- So there was no car.

21:30.540 --> 21:32.000
She ripped off her friends
to go play.

21:32.042 --> 21:33.668
- So if she's willing
to do that to friends,

21:33.710 --> 21:35.253
who knows what she'd do
to her favorite uncle.

21:35.295 --> 21:36.880
- Especially when he sends her
messages like this:

21:36.921 --> 21:38.423
"Keep your hands
off my goddamn money."

21:38.465 --> 21:40.759
That was from this week.
- Hollis sent us screenshots

21:40.800 --> 21:42.552
of her texts this week.
This wasn't on it.

21:42.594 --> 21:44.929
It's time to have another chat
with her selective ass.

21:44.971 --> 21:48.141
- Hold up.
She already lied to us once.

21:48.183 --> 21:50.727
How 'bout we do this
the old-fashioned way?

21:50.769 --> 21:53.772
* *

21:56.816 --> 21:58.818
- You're kidding, right?

21:58.860 --> 22:00.195
- I don't get why
we just didn't handle this

22:00.236 --> 22:01.863
ourselves, Gabi.
She's just gonna lawyer up.

22:01.905 --> 22:03.823
- Look, I know
this looks bad, okay?

22:03.865 --> 22:06.534
But Reggie fired me as his
guardian every other week.

22:06.576 --> 22:07.577
I said he was prickly.

22:07.619 --> 22:08.912
- And the FundMeOn scam?

22:08.953 --> 22:10.705
- I scammed dumb men
on the Internet

22:10.747 --> 22:12.040
into paying for my vacation,

22:12.082 --> 22:13.875
but I would never steal
from family.

22:13.917 --> 22:16.378
[cell phone buzzing]

22:16.419 --> 22:19.089
- Wait.
Don't answer yet.

22:19.130 --> 22:20.715
- Might finally be
the ransom call.

22:20.757 --> 22:24.552
* *

22:24.594 --> 22:25.929
[recording chimes]

22:30.392 --> 22:32.727
- Hello?
- [coughing]

22:32.769 --> 22:34.229
Hollis.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.022
Leave me alone.

22:36.064 --> 22:37.565
- Oh, my God, Uncle Reggie?

22:37.607 --> 22:38.942
- Act normal, keep him talking.

22:38.983 --> 22:41.069
You don't know he's missing.

22:43.780 --> 22:44.948
- You good?

22:44.989 --> 22:47.242
- [strained] Yes.

22:47.283 --> 22:50.245
I-I'm just taking
some personal time.

22:50.286 --> 22:51.246
You hear?

22:51.287 --> 22:52.872
Stop texting me.

22:52.914 --> 22:54.916
[grunts, coughs]
[line beeps]

22:54.958 --> 22:56.668
- Did you hear him?

22:56.710 --> 22:57.836
He was barely breathing.

22:57.877 --> 22:58.962
Something is wrong!
I need--

22:59.004 --> 23:01.047
- We're gonna find him, Hollis.

23:01.089 --> 23:02.966
- Alive?

23:08.805 --> 23:11.766
[soft tense music]

23:11.808 --> 23:14.936
* *

23:14.978 --> 23:17.939
- I sent everyone home
for the night.

23:17.981 --> 23:21.985
- I, um--I'm really worried
about Margaret.

23:22.027 --> 23:24.446
She's acting like the whole
daughter thing isn't happening.

23:24.487 --> 23:27.449
- Everyone deals with trauma
differently, Lacey.

23:27.490 --> 23:29.451
We respect that around here.

23:29.492 --> 23:30.702
Good night.

23:32.328 --> 23:35.123
- Are you mad at me
or something?

23:39.794 --> 23:41.254
I can feel it.

23:41.296 --> 23:42.672
If I did something wrong,

23:42.714 --> 23:45.467
just tell me what it is,
and I can fix it.

23:45.508 --> 23:48.595
* *

23:48.636 --> 23:49.971
- There's nothing to fix.

23:50.013 --> 23:51.806
All I'm thinking about
is Reggie.

23:51.848 --> 23:52.807
See you tomorrow.

23:52.849 --> 23:55.935
* *

23:57.562 --> 24:00.774
- I was starting to think
there was no work for us today.

24:00.815 --> 24:03.485
Play the call again.

24:03.526 --> 24:06.071
- [coughing]

24:06.112 --> 24:07.489
Hollis.

24:07.530 --> 24:09.032
Leave me alone.

24:09.074 --> 24:11.326
- Oh, my God, Uncle Reggie?

24:11.368 --> 24:12.911
You good?

24:12.952 --> 24:14.412
- [strained] Yes.

24:14.454 --> 24:17.290
I-I'm just taking
some personal time.

24:17.332 --> 24:20.418
You hear?
Stop texting me.

24:22.921 --> 24:24.839
- Guilt is rough, isn't it?

24:24.881 --> 24:27.425
- I have nothing
to feel guilty about.

24:27.467 --> 24:29.969
No matter what I may
or may not have said,

24:30.011 --> 24:31.805
you're the one
who kidnapped Bella.

24:31.846 --> 24:34.057
That's on you.

24:34.099 --> 24:35.642
- I was talking
about your guilt

24:35.684 --> 24:38.812
over not having found
our sick victim.

24:38.853 --> 24:41.898
The call, again please.

24:43.233 --> 24:45.276
- [coughing]

24:45.318 --> 24:46.695
Hollis.

24:46.736 --> 24:48.947
Leave me alone.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.408
- There are two people
wheezing on that call.

24:51.449 --> 24:52.701
The higher-pitched one,
that's not

24:52.742 --> 24:54.244
illness related, that's fear.

24:54.285 --> 24:56.204
That's your kidnapper,
and they're terrified.

24:56.246 --> 24:57.956
- Maybe the kidnapping
wasn't planned.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.041
- Everything about this case
screams amateur hour.

25:00.083 --> 25:03.253
Likely their first one.
That's how it was for me.

25:04.421 --> 25:05.672
Isn't that why I'm here,

25:05.714 --> 25:07.590
to provide
my personal expertise?

25:07.632 --> 25:09.426
- Get to the point.

25:09.467 --> 25:13.805
- This person is scared
and unstable.

25:13.847 --> 25:16.641
- And unstable people
are more likely to kill.

25:16.683 --> 25:18.351
* *

25:23.648 --> 25:24.024
.

25:24.065 --> 25:25.025
- Your mother doesn't
know I called.

25:26.693 --> 25:27.861
They're unsigned.

25:27.902 --> 25:29.654
[soft dramatic music]

25:29.696 --> 25:33.533
Do you understand what
you're asking her to do?

25:33.575 --> 25:36.661
- I understand
it's not your business.

25:36.703 --> 25:38.163
- I get it.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.665
Your entire family went
through hell, Taylor,

25:40.707 --> 25:42.000
including your mother.

25:42.042 --> 25:43.501
She's an amazing person

25:43.543 --> 25:45.879
who's just a little broken
like the rest of us.

25:45.920 --> 25:49.090
These documents are binding.

25:49.132 --> 25:51.676
- Are you her lawyer
or something?

25:51.718 --> 25:53.345
- I'm her friend--

25:53.386 --> 25:57.223
who's also, like,
kind of 2/3 a lawyer.

25:57.265 --> 25:58.725
- The bond you two have
must be real

25:58.767 --> 26:02.103
for you to put yourself
in the middle like this.

26:03.772 --> 26:06.274
You know, I used to think

26:06.316 --> 26:10.236
my mom couldn't be
anyone's mother.

26:10.278 --> 26:13.698
Maybe it's just that
she couldn't be mine...

26:13.740 --> 26:16.117
even after the grief ended.

26:18.119 --> 26:21.039
- That's just it, Taylor.

26:21.081 --> 26:23.500
The grief hasn't ended.

26:25.502 --> 26:28.922
Do you know she still spends
every night at the bus station?

26:28.963 --> 26:31.508
- The one
where Jamie went missing?

26:31.549 --> 26:34.219
That's insane.

26:34.260 --> 26:38.640
- Every night for 13 years.

26:40.350 --> 26:43.561
Does that sound like a woman
whose grief has ended?

26:43.603 --> 26:47.649
* *

26:50.485 --> 26:52.737
- Sorry you couldn't
go home first.

26:52.779 --> 26:53.905
- Case comes first.

26:53.947 --> 26:55.407
But--but what are
we doing here?

26:55.448 --> 26:56.950
We swept the place yesterday.

26:56.991 --> 27:00.245
- Guilt can cloud the mind.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.247
Neither of us were
at our best yesterday,

27:02.288 --> 27:04.708
so I figured it couldn't hurt
for us to just

27:04.749 --> 27:06.668
go over this place again.

27:06.710 --> 27:09.004
- I thought I could
compartmentalize my feelings

27:09.045 --> 27:11.798
about seeing Taylor
after all this time.

27:11.840 --> 27:14.509
I'm sorry, uh, both for being
distracted at work

27:14.551 --> 27:18.805
and for...
not telling you about Taylor.

27:18.847 --> 27:21.641
- You don't owe me an apology.

27:21.683 --> 27:24.019
Let's bring Reggie home.

27:25.729 --> 27:29.149
[high-pitched ringing]

27:37.615 --> 27:39.492
How do you do that again?

27:39.534 --> 27:44.664
Take in and remember things
in such detail.

27:44.706 --> 27:47.792
- You trying
to remember something?

27:47.834 --> 27:49.252
- Actually, yes.

27:49.294 --> 27:52.589
A conversation
from a long time ago--

27:52.630 --> 27:53.673
20 years.

27:56.468 --> 27:59.346
- I know that Lacey calls it
a superpower,

27:59.387 --> 28:01.306
but it's really
13 years of training

28:01.348 --> 28:03.266
that started the day
Jamie went missing.

28:03.308 --> 28:05.518
I don't just go to the bus
station hoping to find him.

28:05.560 --> 28:09.314
I go to keep the memory
of that day fresh.

28:09.356 --> 28:11.149
You know, those--
those precious seconds

28:11.191 --> 28:13.109
between when I had him
and when I didn't.

28:13.151 --> 28:16.404
And I--and I recreate the day
as much as I can.

28:16.446 --> 28:18.823
- Let go of the shame,
Margaret.

28:18.865 --> 28:20.241
- [chuckles]

28:20.283 --> 28:23.119
You know, Lacey said
basically the same thing.

28:23.161 --> 28:24.829
You raised her well.

28:24.871 --> 28:26.664
- I didn't raise her.

28:26.706 --> 28:29.167
- Well, not literally, no.

28:29.209 --> 28:33.004
But I mean,
Lacey, me, Dhan, Zeke,

28:33.046 --> 28:35.965
I mean, we all met
at our lowest.

28:36.007 --> 28:40.136
And look at us now.

28:40.178 --> 28:41.429
Our power, our purpose,

28:41.471 --> 28:44.432
that's all
because of you, Gabi.

28:44.474 --> 28:46.851
And that should
fill you with pride,

28:46.893 --> 28:48.186
not guilt.

28:48.228 --> 28:54.401
* *

28:54.442 --> 28:57.612
Where's Reggie's recent mail?

28:57.654 --> 28:59.864
A guy who lives his life
offline should have

28:59.906 --> 29:01.366
stacks of mail.

29:01.408 --> 29:04.619
[suspenseful music]

29:04.661 --> 29:07.831
- This is everything
that was in his mailbox.

29:07.872 --> 29:09.499
Is there anything else
I can do to help?

29:09.541 --> 29:11.251
- This is great.
Thanks, Cliff.

29:11.292 --> 29:13.378
- I should have thought
of his mail sooner.

29:13.420 --> 29:17.298
It's the only other time
of the day we had to connect.

29:17.340 --> 29:21.678
Reggie always had
some silly joke.

29:21.720 --> 29:24.639
- How long have you been
in love with him?

29:24.681 --> 29:27.100
There's a slight change in your
voice when you say his name,

29:27.142 --> 29:29.602
and it's in your eyes.

29:31.104 --> 29:32.355
- For years.

29:32.397 --> 29:35.817
[soft dramatic music]

29:35.859 --> 29:37.402
I know it sounds pathetic,

29:37.444 --> 29:40.405
all this off of a few
conversations every day.

29:40.447 --> 29:42.073
- It is not pathetic.
Because of it,

29:42.115 --> 29:44.534
you noticed Reggie was missing
when nobody else did.

29:47.454 --> 29:51.458
- Did Reggie say anything
about switching banks?

29:51.499 --> 29:52.917
- If somebody was trying
to steal from him,

29:52.959 --> 29:54.085
he'd change accounts,

29:54.127 --> 29:56.421
not leave the whole bank.

29:56.463 --> 29:58.423
- Unless the bank is the thief.

29:58.465 --> 30:00.425
- I reached out
to an old friend at the OCC.

30:00.467 --> 30:01.885
Two Bank of Citizens Bay
branches,

30:01.926 --> 30:03.970
including Reggie's,
are under investigation

30:04.012 --> 30:05.430
for complaints
of missing funds.

30:05.472 --> 30:07.223
Guess who's worked
at both branches.

30:07.265 --> 30:08.641
- Julian,
Reggie's account manager.

30:08.683 --> 30:10.769
- The security video--
Reggie was probably

30:10.810 --> 30:12.645
confronting Julian
about the stealing.

30:12.687 --> 30:14.356
Julian took him
to shut him up.

30:14.397 --> 30:15.940
- We need to get to the bank.
- You and Lacey

30:15.982 --> 30:18.026
go keep an eye on him.
This is all circumstantial.

30:18.068 --> 30:20.320
We need something concrete
before we spook him.

30:20.362 --> 30:21.946
- Too late.
Check your phones.

30:21.988 --> 30:23.490
[phones ding]

30:23.531 --> 30:27.452
- "Reported critical missing:
Reggie Moore, 71"--

30:27.494 --> 30:28.370
Damn it.

30:28.411 --> 30:30.288
- Trent must have issued
the CMA.

30:30.330 --> 30:32.665
- Consider Julian spooked.

30:33.458 --> 30:35.418
- What the hell happened
to no CMA?

30:35.460 --> 30:38.296
- Reggie is out of time.
I made a judgement call.

30:38.338 --> 30:40.382
- Hey, just came in,
confirmed sighting

30:40.423 --> 30:42.425
of Reggie being pushed
into a maroon Honda Ridgeline

30:42.467 --> 30:43.968
three days ago
after he left the bank.

30:44.010 --> 30:45.303
- Check the DMV records.

30:45.345 --> 30:47.305
See if they match
a Julian Barker,

30:47.347 --> 30:48.932
Reggie's account manager.

30:48.973 --> 30:51.768
- Shaker, once we have an
address for the car, haul ass.

30:51.810 --> 30:54.562
Search every inch
of that property for Reggie.

30:54.604 --> 30:55.772
- Got you.

30:55.814 --> 30:57.315
- I'll meet you at the bank.
- Too late.

30:57.357 --> 30:58.358
I'm already here.

30:58.400 --> 30:59.651
[dial tone]

30:59.693 --> 31:03.321
[dramatic music]

31:03.363 --> 31:04.989
Julian's desk is empty.

31:05.031 --> 31:06.658
Security said we just
missed him by a few minutes.

31:06.700 --> 31:08.785
- Eye in the sky,
what have you got?

31:10.662 --> 31:12.330
- Ridgeline, northwest corner.

31:12.372 --> 31:15.542
* *

31:15.583 --> 31:17.335
- Hey!
- You're not cops!

31:17.377 --> 31:18.837
You can't do this!
[car horn honks]

31:18.878 --> 31:21.589
[car alarm beeping]

31:23.133 --> 31:25.635
- Hey, bestie.
[sirens wailing]

31:25.677 --> 31:27.846
Time to have another chat.

31:27.887 --> 31:29.848
- No sign of Reggie
at Julian's house.

31:29.889 --> 31:31.725
No pills, nothing.

31:31.766 --> 31:32.851
I'm taking him in.

31:32.892 --> 31:34.185
- We can get a location
out of him.

31:34.227 --> 31:35.520
- I bet you can.

31:35.562 --> 31:37.188
You lay a finger on him,

31:37.230 --> 31:39.524
we can't charge him,
and he walks.

31:39.566 --> 31:41.818
- Nice guy loses his husband
and you steal from him?

31:41.860 --> 31:43.653
[grunts]
Six hits till your jaw breaks.

31:43.695 --> 31:44.863
- Hey, hey!
- That's one.

31:44.904 --> 31:46.031
[grunts]
Two.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.115
- Dhan, stop it!

31:47.157 --> 31:48.366
- 3708 Foote Street Northeast.

31:48.408 --> 31:51.036
Place is a bank foreclosure.

31:51.077 --> 31:54.039

- Reggie.

32:04.174 --> 32:06.259
- Mm.
- I'm Gabi.

32:06.301 --> 32:07.719
- Mm.
- Hi.

32:07.761 --> 32:08.803
- Mm.

32:10.055 --> 32:11.890
- You're safe now.

32:11.931 --> 32:14.601

32:19.564 --> 32:20.190
[soft sentimental music]

32:22.567 --> 32:24.861
- I'm so sorry I worried you,
baby girl.

32:24.903 --> 32:26.446
- No. I'm sorry.

32:26.488 --> 32:28.948
I should have noticed
that you were lonely.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.700
I should have noticed
your account manager

32:30.742 --> 32:32.369
was stealing from you.
- No, no, no.

32:32.410 --> 32:34.954
I should've said something.

32:34.996 --> 32:37.665
I was--
[sighs]

32:37.707 --> 32:39.918
I was just embarrassed.

32:39.959 --> 32:42.295
I thought Julian was my friend.
I trusted him.

32:42.337 --> 32:45.048
- There's nothing wrong with
looking for the best in people.

32:45.090 --> 32:46.966
- * For you,
for you, for you *

32:47.008 --> 32:48.843
* Did you know that I can
be that person for you *

32:48.885 --> 32:51.429
- I'm gonna do better,
Uncle Reggie.

32:51.471 --> 32:52.889
- * For you, for you *

32:52.931 --> 32:55.642
- But you did real good,
baby girl.

32:55.684 --> 32:57.394
You hired Ms. Mosely here,
and--

32:57.435 --> 32:59.312
and you got me home.

32:59.354 --> 33:02.190
- Actually, I didn't.

33:02.232 --> 33:03.900
Cliff did.

33:05.360 --> 33:07.153
- Cliff.

33:07.195 --> 33:08.822
Stop hiding over there.

33:08.863 --> 33:11.908
* *

33:11.950 --> 33:14.994
- When you weren't
on your usual schedule,

33:15.036 --> 33:17.205
I was worried.

33:17.247 --> 33:18.998
- Cliff saved your life.

33:20.917 --> 33:22.711
- Thank you doesn't seem
like enough.

33:22.752 --> 33:27.298
- Our little talks truly are
the best part of my day.

33:27.340 --> 33:29.509
So I noticed when they stopped.

33:29.551 --> 33:32.512
- Well, they're mine too.

33:32.554 --> 33:34.889
Would you like to come up
for tea some time?

33:37.100 --> 33:38.435
- I'd love to.

33:38.476 --> 33:40.770
- [chuckles]
All right.

33:40.812 --> 33:43.356
[laughing]

33:43.398 --> 33:44.983
- Ah, you should've
seen it, Zeke.

33:45.025 --> 33:48.028
Looks like tea will be
their first date.

33:50.822 --> 33:53.867
- I'm sorry I got so hot
about the alert.

33:53.908 --> 33:54.659
It helped.

33:54.701 --> 33:56.453
- I appreciate that.

33:56.494 --> 33:59.706
But after the beatdown
Dhan gave Julian,

33:59.748 --> 34:02.584
chances of charges sticking
are pretty slim.

34:03.835 --> 34:05.837
- Give me five minutes
with him.

34:05.879 --> 34:09.507
I won't touch him, I promise.

34:09.549 --> 34:12.510
[pensive music]

34:12.552 --> 34:15.055

34:15.096 --> 34:17.932
- Five minutes.

34:17.974 --> 34:19.851
[door clicks]

34:19.893 --> 34:21.728
- My lawyers are gonna
have a field day

34:21.770 --> 34:22.771
with you and your team.

34:22.812 --> 34:24.147
- Mm, I don't think so.

34:24.189 --> 34:25.940
See, I've been doing
a little research,

34:25.982 --> 34:28.902
and here are five people
whose accounts you've drained--

34:28.943 --> 34:32.655
all older, all lonely,
all suddenly linked to you.

34:32.697 --> 34:34.657
And then there's one

34:34.699 --> 34:37.118
that turned up dead.

34:37.160 --> 34:38.453
- What?

34:38.495 --> 34:39.537
I didn't kill anyone.

34:39.579 --> 34:41.247
- I can make it true, trust.

34:41.289 --> 34:42.874
So you have two choices.

34:42.916 --> 34:45.085
Confess, do your time,
and I'll leave you alone.

34:45.126 --> 34:47.587
Or don't, and I'll be on that
ass for the rest of your life.

34:47.629 --> 34:49.714
Every morning,
you'll wake up wondering,

34:49.756 --> 34:51.633
does Gabi Mosely
have time today?

34:51.675 --> 34:53.385
And the answer is yes.

34:53.426 --> 34:56.930
Gabi Mosely always has time.

34:56.971 --> 34:59.099
- * She's a fashion queen *

34:59.140 --> 35:01.559

* Can't break a diamond *

35:03.687 --> 35:05.438

* Yeah *

and, uh, congratulations.

35:49.399 --> 35:51.943

the first night we met?

- Course I do.

how was I?

Was I angry?

Was I...

Happy?

I was expecting you?

- No.

You were completely confused,

You were amazing.

I didn't say I wanted a friend.

37:08.561 --> 37:10.480
I said quite the opposite.

37:10.522 --> 37:12.232
You can't manipulate me.

37:12.273 --> 37:15.318
- But I did for a while.

- Listen to me, you pathetic
excuse for a human being.

Your dad wanted you and your
