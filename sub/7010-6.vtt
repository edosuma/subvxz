02:48.585 --> 02:51.253
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
MAKE OUT WITH HER.

02:55.300 --> 02:59.178
THEREFORE,
DONNA CAN'T GO.

02:59.345 --> 03:03.432
OR... YOU COULD JUST NOT
MAKE OUT WITH MY SISTER.

03:04.475 --> 03:07.060
BE SERIOUS, ERIC.

SOME CANADIANS THERE.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.648
EEW!

05:58.816 --> 06:00.567

11:25.309 --> 11:26.810
WHOA, MAN, THEY'RE
GOING TO THE RESTROOM?

11:26.977 --> 11:29.145
YOU KNOW WHAT GIRLS DO
IN THE RESTROOM, RIGHT?

11:29.313 --> 11:32.774
OH. I LIKE TO PRETEND
LIKE THEY DON'T DO THAT.

HIS BROTHER.

12:44.013 --> 12:48.016
HE'S NOT EVEN BRAD.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.851
BUT HE LOOKS
JUST LIKE HIM.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.311
THAT'S THE POINT.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.146
YOU KNOW, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WATCH

12:53.314 --> 12:56.357

PAY ATTENTION.

12:56.525 --> 12:57.817
I'M SORRY ABOUT RED.

12:57.985 --> 12:59.486
HE'S JUST... HE'S BEEN
A TINY BIT CRANKY

12:59.653 --> 13:01.070

HE JUST, UM, HE SITS AROUND
AND HE MOPES ALL DAY.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.122
HE ONCE TOLD ME THAT IF HE
EVER STARTED WATCHING SOAPS,

13:11.290 --> 13:12.540
I SHOULD SHOOT HIM.

13:12.708 --> 13:13.917
