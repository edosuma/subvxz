02:22.360 --> 02:23.850
My brother.

02:26.200 --> 02:29.682
- She's gone?
- Yeah.

02:29.840 --> 02:32.525
Well, what'd the doctor say?

02:34.040 --> 02:35.644
That they, um...

02:36.560 --> 02:38.642
That they did what they could.

02:58.240 --> 03:00.925
I don't know. Probably just go home.

Maybe tell some stories,
go for a walk, or uh...

03:18.080 --> 03:20.080
You know, I'm kinda hoping
you're gonna say no here

03:20.120 --> 03:22.480
- so I can stop doing this, all right?
- No. Thanks, though.

03:33.520 --> 03:38.321

OK, come in.

Hey.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.371
Mm.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.726
Is Grandma gonna take me to school?

06:18.360 --> 06:21.125
I don't know. I think, um...

06:23.120 --> 06:25.964
I think I'm gonna take you to school.

06:28.320 --> 06:30.561
Can you finish getting ready?

06:30.720 --> 06:32.290
- Yes.
- OK.

07:00.520 --> 07:01.851
What's going on?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.241
You need to comb out my hair.

07:06.840 --> 07:11.050
- Really? You... You can't do that yet?
- Nope.

07:20.840 --> 07:24.606
Not from the top down,
from the bottom up.

07:26.240 --> 07:27.685
<i>GK.</i>

07:29.800 --> 07:31.086
Wow.

07:54.400 --> 07:58.166
- This is every day?
- Yup.

08:03.600 --> 08:07.241
- Eloise! We can't be late, honey.
- OK.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.841
Wait, wait, wait. Shut the door.

08:12.560 --> 08:16.724
- Here. Put this in my hair, please.
- Your hair?

08:17.480 --> 08:18.970
<i>GK.</i>

08:27.760 --> 08:30.445
Rosita, can you help me
find my sunglasses, please?

08:30.600 --> 08:32.328
- All right.
- There you go.

08:35.320 --> 08:38.289
You tied it like a tennis shoe.
It needs a bow.

08:38.440 --> 08:40.124
- Like Grammie does it.
- All right.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.486
Come redo it.

08:43.080 --> 08:44.570
Let me try again.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.050
All right, there's your bow.

08:55.120 --> 08:56.087
Now what?

08:56.240 --> 08:57.651
You're supposed to make me
brush my teeth.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.451
- I am?
- Yes. Grammie makes me every day.

09:00.640 --> 09:03.530
- Forces me.
- All right, well then, you...

09:04.480 --> 09:07.484
You get up there and you brush
your teeth, young lady. Right now.

09:07.640 --> 09:09.244
Say it like you mean it.

09:09.440 --> 09:12.887
Well, I mean it, all right?
I mean business. Right now!

09:13.880 --> 09:15.769
Good job.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.201
- Are you lost?
- No, I um...

09:23.360 --> 09:25.727
I thought it was on this street.
I'm just...

09:26.640 --> 09:29.769
I'm on the wrong street.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.326
Thought it was somewhere else.

09:35.480 --> 09:37.164
Isn't that called being lost?

09:37.320 --> 09:38.765
Yes, normally.

09:38.920 --> 09:43.642
I mean, it could be, but it isn't now,
right? I'm... not lost.

09:46.400 --> 09:48.641
How come you don't know?
You come to school every day.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.040
You don't know how to get here?

09:50.160 --> 09:52.208
I'm not driving.
I'm sitting in the back.

09:53.480 --> 09:56.484
If you're lost, you can tell me.
I don't care, Papa.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.564
Yes, I'm lost.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.322
We've gotta hurry up.
They're all inside already.

10:13.480 --> 10:16.484
I know, Puppy, I know.
OK, we're right here. See?

10:18.240 --> 10:20.208
I'm gonna be late!
They're all already in there.

10:20.360 --> 10:21.850
It's OK.
Just tell them your grandfather got...

10:22.000 --> 10:25.607
- Got lost?
- Yes, you can tell them I got lost.

10:25.760 --> 10:29.207
- Does that make you happy?
- It does.

10:31.400 --> 10:32.606
Go on.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.202
<i>I didn't have
the strength to tell her.</i>

10:51.360 --> 10:54.523
<i>Now I'm terrified that one of the kids
in her class will say something to her.</i>

10:54.680 --> 10:57.251
I need to be there
when she gets out of school.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.448
I need to tell her.

11:00.440 --> 11:02.727
It's OK. You'll tell her.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.929
Uh, meantime, we have some
good food here for you both to eat.

11:06.080 --> 11:10.847
Yeah, I was calling about
a memorial service and a burial.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.527
Um... I had spoken to Father Mackley.

11:14.680 --> 11:16.762
He suggested I give you a call.

11:19.440 --> 11:23.001
I'm gonna make some dishes for you,
Elliott, some pre-cooked things

11:23.200 --> 11:24.406
for you two to nibble on.

11:24.560 --> 11:27.245
OK.

11:30.720 --> 11:34.008
Uh, do you need to call her grandmother?
Reggie's mother?

11:34.160 --> 11:35.321
What does she call her, "Wee Wee"?

11:35.480 --> 11:36.970
- Grandma Wee Wee?
- Yeah.

11:37.120 --> 11:38.690
Why would I call her, Rick?

11:38.880 --> 11:40.882
I mean, really,
why would I call any of them?

11:41.040 --> 11:43.202
We're not related. All right?

11:43.360 --> 11:45.727
Carol wasn't related to them.

11:46.680 --> 11:51.322
Guess if I was gonna... call anybody,
it'd be that piece of shit son of hers

11:51.520 --> 11:54.444
that nobody's seen or heard from
in three years.

11:55.360 --> 11:58.921
Believe me, the last person I need
swarming around me right now

11:59.080 --> 12:01.082
is Grandma Wee Wee.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.602
Bad enough I have... you two.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.366
Sorry.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.810
You didn't have to do this, you know.
I could've...

12:16.000 --> 12:18.321
- I could've come on my own.
- Oh, come on.

12:18.480 --> 12:21.006
- We want to be with you right now.
- What a pretty school.

12:21.160 --> 12:24.323
I heard it's like one of the best ever.

12:26.840 --> 12:29.730
- Tell me your name again?
- Fay.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.450
That's right.

12:31.640 --> 12:33.483
You're right, Fay.

12:33.640 --> 12:34.687
Hey, there she is.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.524
Hey, are you sure you're up for this?

12:36.680 --> 12:38.808
Why don't I just grab her,
we'll take her back to the house,

12:38.960 --> 12:41.486
- tell her later when you're...
- I'm fine. Relax, Rick.

12:42.520 --> 12:45.922
Fay?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.321
That ain't gonna help.

12:56.720 --> 13:02.363
Papa, Andi Jacobson wants me to come
over and scrapbook at her house today.

13:02.520 --> 13:03.885
You want to do that?

13:04.040 --> 13:09.126
Go scrapbook over at
Andi Jack... ogym... Johnson's house?

13:09.280 --> 13:12.329
No. But I told her I'd ask you.

13:13.240 --> 13:15.766
Well, you did. You asked and I said no.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.081
Thank you.

13:18.560 --> 13:21.086
Let's go over here for a minute, Eloise.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.649
Talk with you about something.

13:31.320 --> 13:35.211
We had a bad night last night,
Eloise, you and I.

13:37.920 --> 13:41.083
Grandma Carol was killed in a accident.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.126
A car accident.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.809
A man hit her and...

13:48.840 --> 13:53.209
and she and he and several others,

13:53.360 --> 13:55.169
they're all gone.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.531
Have you been drinking?

13:58.520 --> 14:02.002
I... I have, yes. That's why, um...

14:02.920 --> 14:06.049
That's why Rick and his girlfriend Fudge
are out there in the car,

14:06.240 --> 14:08.846
'cause I've had a few drinks.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.322
I don't like it when you drink.

14:12.480 --> 14:13.766
I know.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.524
Her name isn't Fudge.

14:16.680 --> 14:19.729
- Rick's girlfriend, it isn't Fudge.
- Who said it was Fudge?

14:19.920 --> 14:21.809
- It couldn't be. You did.
- No.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.604
You said Rick and his girlfriend, Fudge.

14:23.800 --> 14:26.041
No, I said it was, um...

14:26.600 --> 14:27.761
it was...

14:32.760 --> 14:36.242
- I actually don't remember her name.
- Her name, it isn't Fudge.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.846
- I just know that.
- No, no. No, no, of course not.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.002
It couldn't be Fudge.

14:46.200 --> 14:50.649
I'm so sorry about your grandma, Eloise.

14:52.280 --> 14:54.647
I know you loved her a lot.

14:54.800 --> 14:59.044
And she loved you so very much.

15:00.920 --> 15:02.490
I'm sorry.

15:07.920 --> 15:12.403
- Are you OK, Pup?
- No. I'm super sad.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.643
So am I, sweetheart.

17:40.640 --> 17:44.008
I tell myself, "One day, Rowena,

17:44.160 --> 17:47.926
you're gonna get Elliott
to invite us all out for a swim."

17:48.080 --> 17:51.641
You got a plan for Eloise
in light of all this?

17:51.880 --> 17:54.406
Not sure, not yet.

17:54.560 --> 17:56.767
Probably just love her.
That's the plan for now.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.524
Mm.

17:58.720 --> 18:02.645
She's got a whole lot of family
down with me. Mm-hm.

18:02.800 --> 18:06.850
I got my Kristen, and her cute little
gay family across the street.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.810
And her darlin'
little music teacher wife.

18:09.960 --> 18:13.203
Got two of my brother's girls
and my sister's boy.

18:13.400 --> 18:17.530
- All on my dime.
- Go figure.

18:18.640 --> 18:22.690
Well, you can always come visit,
come for a swim. How's that?

18:24.040 --> 18:26.611
I know you don't like my boy.

18:26.760 --> 18:29.081
I know you're still angry,
but this isn't about Reggie.

18:29.240 --> 18:31.041
He's not in the picture.
This is about Eloise.

OK, got it.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.765
Got it. Jeez...

18:35.920 --> 18:39.367
Have a sandwich, Rowena.
Maybe a drink. All right?

18:39.520 --> 18:40.646
Enjoy yourself.

18:40.800 --> 18:44.043
I'd go somewhere and play some poker
if I was looking to enjoy myself.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.725
Maybe a Lakers game.

18:45.880 --> 18:47.723
Not here for a good time.

18:47.880 --> 18:51.566
- It's a wake, remember?
- Fine.

18:52.560 --> 18:53.971
Point taken.

19:04.600 --> 19:07.046
Toothpaste, toothbrush,
in your mouth, now.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.724
- What?
- Madder.

19:10.920 --> 19:13.321
You gotta be madder at me
like you mean it.

19:16.840 --> 19:18.604
Let me, uh...

19:18.800 --> 19:20.564
Want me to just go out and start again?

19:20.760 --> 19:21.966
Yeah.

19:25.920 --> 19:28.082
Eloise, you brush those teeth!
I mean it.

19:28.240 --> 19:30.686
Don't make me come in there
and have to say it twice.

19:30.840 --> 19:32.330
Nice.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.326
Aren't you going
to drive me to school?

19:51.240 --> 19:52.321
Yes.

19:52.480 --> 19:54.050
<i>GK.</i>

20:13.480 --> 20:14.925
Morning.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.810
You're in the third grade
and you're dealing...

20:36.960 --> 20:40.442
You're in the third grade and you're
dealing with this level math?

20:40.600 --> 20:44.571
I didn't deal with
this stuff until... ever.

20:44.760 --> 20:47.161
Does that mean
you're not going to help me?

20:48.720 --> 20:50.006
Of course not.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.525
Not at all. Let's take a...

20:54.520 --> 20:56.329
Let's take a shot at this.

20:56.520 --> 20:59.364
I'm not very good at math, though,
all right? I'm a lawyer.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.006
- You know what we're good at, right?
- What?

21:04.200 --> 21:05.361
Nothing.

21:06.360 --> 21:09.125
That was...

21:09.280 --> 21:10.611
That was a joke.

21:19.720 --> 21:24.044
Hi. I'm Duvan. Are you Elliott?

21:24.200 --> 21:26.521
Yes, yes. Uh...

21:26.720 --> 21:28.210
- Nice to meet you. Come on in.
- Thank you.

21:28.360 --> 21:29.486
Come on in.

21:30.760 --> 21:32.808
My résumé.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.209
A list of my study courses.

21:51.880 --> 21:54.281
A paper that I wrote
for the National Math Board

21:54.440 --> 21:57.410
on systemic dysfunction
in proper Algebraic education.

22:00.960 --> 22:03.281
That's good. This is good.

22:05.160 --> 22:07.845
- You want a drink?
- I would... like a drink, yes.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.368
OK, good.
What do you like? I got the works.

22:11.520 --> 22:14.524
Oh, no, just a water, please.

22:17.600 --> 22:21.730
And... another paper that I wrote.

22:21.880 --> 22:23.644
In the flyer, my piano lessons.

22:23.800 --> 22:27.521
I have a fall special that I'm currently
running that offers the piano lessons

22:27.680 --> 22:30.206
half off when purchased with tutoring
in either math, science

22:30.360 --> 22:32.966
or any of the eight languages
that I have listed there.

22:33.160 --> 22:35.527
You sure you don't want a cocktail?

22:35.680 --> 22:37.842
You're very, very qualified, Duvan.
That's good.

22:38.040 --> 22:40.611
Because Eloise, she's special.

22:40.760 --> 22:45.800
She lost her grandmother... my wife,
about three weeks ago in a car crash.

22:45.960 --> 22:48.201
I don't want her to fall behind
in her studies.

22:48.360 --> 22:50.362
- What about her mother?
- My daughter?

22:50.520 --> 22:54.969
She died during childbirth.
She had congenital heart problems.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.600
My wife and I weren't with her
at the hospital when she was born.

22:59.640 --> 23:02.450
Weren't invited. Or included.

23:05.440 --> 23:09.331
We, uh... We weren't called,
let's just put it that way.

23:11.480 --> 23:14.768
The doctors weren't aware
of her medical history.

23:16.480 --> 23:20.326
I lost my father, my grandfather
and two of my brothers.

23:20.480 --> 23:24.963
Killed by murderers,
along with 300 others from my village.

23:27.480 --> 23:28.641
I'm sorry.

23:28.840 --> 23:31.844
A paper I wrote on literature's
effect on grief

23:32.000 --> 23:36.130
for the library of the National
Endowment for Children's Literature.

23:36.280 --> 23:40.683
I have also written a paper
on channeling our emotions

23:40.840 --> 23:45.448
in a positive direction using meditation
and alternative grief counseling.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.807
That's good, but there's gonna
be something else, all right?

23:47.960 --> 23:50.167
It's not gonna be just Eloise.

23:50.360 --> 23:51.771
It's gonna be me as well.

23:51.920 --> 23:56.403
I'm gonna need a little tutoring
in math myself.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.562
Is that gonna be a problem?

23:58.720 --> 24:01.610
No, that will not be a problem at all.

24:01.760 --> 24:05.207
I do, however, charge by the student.

24:05.360 --> 24:08.045
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

24:08.200 --> 24:09.440
<i>Elliott, it's Rowena.</i>

24:09.600 --> 24:11.568
Now I need you to pick up that phone
and call me, baby.

24:11.760 --> 24:14.240
I know you're in pain.
Your pain is my pain.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.209
That little girl is my little girl. OK?

24:16.360 --> 24:20.410
<i>Pick up the phone. Call Wee Wee.
Call Wee Wee.</i>

24:20.600 --> 24:23.046
Kyle had 32 shells.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.601
He gave eight to his friend.

24:25.760 --> 24:29.526
- How many shells does Kyle have now?
- Eight to his friend?

24:29.680 --> 24:31.728
Eight to his friend.
This might be a bit easier for you.

24:31.880 --> 24:34.247
But write it down, please, both of you.

24:46.040 --> 24:47.883
- No, I'm good.
- You sure?

24:48.040 --> 24:49.451
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

24:49.600 --> 24:52.922
So what's the deal with, uh,
Jonny Quest's sidekick?

24:53.080 --> 24:54.570
- Where'd you find him?
- Craigslist.

24:54.760 --> 24:57.331
- Oh, yeah?
- He's very good.

24:57.480 --> 25:00.165
So what's going on?
What's so important you had to see me?

25:00.320 --> 25:03.847
It's Reggie's mother.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.684
You know who her baby brother is, right?

25:05.840 --> 25:08.207
He's a senior partner
at that new firm over there on Flower.

25:08.400 --> 25:10.601
She's got him threatening
to file a family court hearing

25:10.720 --> 25:13.087
on custody of Eloise
unless you deal with her.

25:13.280 --> 25:16.045
- Threatening or filing?
- Threatening, at this point.

25:16.240 --> 25:17.765
Well, that's hilarious.

25:17.920 --> 25:20.890
They don't know jack about family law.
They sue corporations, Rick.

25:21.080 --> 25:23.924
They make billionaires beg.
They don't...

25:24.120 --> 25:25.690
They don't do custody hearings.

25:25.840 --> 25:28.605
Well, guess what, Elliott,
neither do we.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.410
Have you thought about that?

25:31.240 --> 25:32.571
Listen...

25:33.840 --> 25:38.687
Do you really plan on raising this girl?
Full time?

25:38.840 --> 25:41.764
I'm not being a dick. I'm just asking.
Are you sure you're up for this?

25:41.920 --> 25:44.651
You know... raising a little
black girl all by yourself?

25:44.800 --> 25:47.804
Little black... What the hell
does that mean? She's not black!

25:47.960 --> 25:49.883
- All right? She's half black.
- All right.

25:50.040 --> 25:51.690
She's also half white.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.842
Which, by the way, what does that
have to do with anything?

25:54.000 --> 25:56.651
That's the stupidest thing
you ever said to me. I expect that...

25:56.800 --> 25:58.529
I expect that from Wee Wee, not you.

25:58.680 --> 26:01.923
OK, well, technically,
she has just as many rights as you do.

26:02.120 --> 26:04.282
Just enough to have it
brought up in a hearing.

26:04.440 --> 26:07.683
So I suggest you go and talk it out with
her before she gets the state involved.

26:07.840 --> 26:10.446
I'm telling you, Rowena's brother is
not somebody you wanna mess around with.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.887
The guy has like six different degrees.

26:13.040 --> 26:17.090
Well, you know how many degrees your
rectal thermometer has at home, Rick?

26:17.240 --> 26:20.847
You know where
you put that thing? Shit.

26:21.800 --> 26:24.371
These are the study papers
for the next time that we meet.

26:24.560 --> 26:27.689
Can I go watch TV now,
since I worked on my homework?

26:27.840 --> 26:31.128
Of course you can, but first,
say good-bye to Duvan.

26:31.280 --> 26:34.443
- Bye, Duvan.
- Bye.

26:35.160 --> 26:38.050
- Thank you, Elliott.
- Hey, Duvie, can I ask you something?

26:38.240 --> 26:41.847
I know you offer a lot of services,
teach a lot of languages.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.049
- Different skills, you know, shit.
- Yeah, I do.

26:45.200 --> 26:46.440
Can you drive?

26:48.240 --> 26:50.641
I mean, for some good money.
I'm not, um...

26:51.520 --> 26:54.000
capable of driving... right now.

26:54.160 --> 26:55.730
Could you drive me around town
a little today?

26:55.920 --> 26:57.285
Of course, I can do that.

26:58.240 --> 27:02.211
Good. Good. Uh...

27:02.360 --> 27:06.365
Don't tell me you've written a paper
on driving, though. Don't tell me that.

27:08.360 --> 27:12.445
<i>♪ All the waiters
in your grand cafe</i>

27:14.160 --> 27:16.606
You do drive well, Duvan.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.240
- Thank you.
- <i>Um...</i>

27:19.400 --> 27:21.209
Where are we going?

27:21.360 --> 27:24.204
South of downtown. South Central.

27:24.360 --> 27:25.725
Have you been there?

27:25.880 --> 27:29.202
No. No, I have not.

27:29.360 --> 27:31.089
Probably seen it on television, though.

27:31.240 --> 27:34.210
- CSI or something?
- I don't watch much television.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.361
No, of course not.

27:35.520 --> 27:39.081
I'm afraid, for me, it is not
a nourishing form of entertainment.

27:40.080 --> 27:42.287
Maybe you should consider

27:42.440 --> 27:47.321
curtailing the amount of hours
Eloise watches television.

27:48.600 --> 27:52.924
OK. Got it. Good tip.

27:53.080 --> 27:55.845
Let's get off at this exit here.
Right here.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.766
<i>♪ Don't wait for answers
Just take your chances</i>

27:59.920 --> 28:03.288

28:24.120 --> 28:26.043
Right up here by this tree.

28:33.040 --> 28:35.805
- Margaret.
- Elliott.

28:42.800 --> 28:45.406
What's up, Elliott, man?

28:45.560 --> 28:47.961
Give me some love, man.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.969
I'm sorry again about Carol.

28:50.200 --> 28:52.771
Thanks, thanks. Where's your aunt?

28:52.960 --> 28:54.803
She in the garage.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.445
Who's this?

28:56.600 --> 29:00.161
<i>Uh...</i> This is Duvan. He's, <i>uh...</i>

29:00.320 --> 29:03.244
- He's my bodyguard.
- No shit.

29:03.400 --> 29:06.882
- You got you a bodyguard?
- Wow.

29:07.040 --> 29:10.647
Is it just me or has the whole world
gotten real gullible?

29:10.800 --> 29:12.440
Hey, Uncle Victor.

29:12.560 --> 29:14.449
- Hey there, Elliott. How's it going?
- Good.

29:14.600 --> 29:17.046
I would get up,
but this back's been killing me.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.362
No worries. I know the feeling.

29:26.320 --> 29:28.561
- Look who's here.
- Hey, Elliott.

29:28.720 --> 29:31.451
- Hey, Elliott.
- Hey, come here. Give me some love.

29:31.600 --> 29:34.001
- Come here. How are you?
- I'm real good, thanks.

29:34.160 --> 29:38.484
- All right.
- This is, uh... Duv... Duv-something.

29:38.640 --> 29:41.928
<i>Um...</i> Elliott got him a bodyguard.

29:42.080 --> 29:45.846
Ooh! Really? You're a bodyguard?

29:46.000 --> 29:49.527
No, that is just some humor
that Elliott had implied earlier.

29:49.720 --> 29:53.167
Come here. Give me some love anyway,
Mr. Bodyguard. Come here.

29:53.320 --> 29:56.164
Oh, wow, I feel safer already.

29:59.800 --> 30:01.962
You OK, Mr. Bodyguard?

30:14.040 --> 30:18.841
Oh, hey, uh... when we come back in,
maybe you can speak to them as a group

30:19.040 --> 30:21.042
about watching too much television.

30:25.440 --> 30:29.729
Well, well, look who came to visit.

30:31.520 --> 30:34.285
This is quite a setup, Rowena.

30:34.440 --> 30:38.001
Quite a setup.

30:43.920 --> 30:45.445
Always impressive.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.762
We aim to impress.

30:47.920 --> 30:49.490
Do our best.

30:51.040 --> 30:52.929
You're welcome to have one.

30:53.120 --> 30:55.521
I just bought out the men's department
of a Sears going down.

30:55.680 --> 30:58.206
Got some beautiful suits
for some lucky men in the neighborhood.

30:58.360 --> 31:00.681
Can only help, right?

31:02.600 --> 31:05.444
- Who do we have here?
- Oh, this is Duvan, our math tutor.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.887
That's good. Math is good.

31:08.040 --> 31:11.442
Math is my middle name, babe.

31:12.480 --> 31:16.565
Rowena, you're not gonna really
take me to court, are you?

31:16.720 --> 31:18.404
Eloise is happy where she is.

31:18.600 --> 31:22.605
Eloise needs more love than just
what her grandfather can give her.

31:23.400 --> 31:27.724
Now Carol... God rest her soul...

31:27.880 --> 31:29.609
Carol was a mom.

31:29.760 --> 31:31.762
She and I, we had us a bond.

31:31.920 --> 31:34.651
Therefore, I had no reason
to worry about my grandbaby.

31:34.800 --> 31:35.801
And now you do?

31:35.960 --> 31:39.089
Well, there are certain things a man
can do, certain things a woman can do.

31:39.240 --> 31:41.447
I don't wanna have to be the one
to spell that out to you, Elliott.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.329
Especially a man your age.

31:43.480 --> 31:45.323
I already told her that
you're all welcome to come visit.

31:45.480 --> 31:48.643
I'm thinking with things
the way they are,

31:48.840 --> 31:52.845
life dealing us all the hands
we've been dealt, she's been dealt,

31:53.000 --> 31:55.321
we need to start talking
about a shared custody.

31:56.480 --> 31:57.720
Not gonna happen.

31:57.880 --> 31:59.291
- No?
- No.

31:59.440 --> 32:01.200
Like I say, you're all welcome
to come visit.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.004
But you don't want her down here,
do you, Elliott?

32:03.160 --> 32:06.004
- Down here with the black folks.
- Don't... Don't start with that.

32:06.200 --> 32:10.842
Got her a little black math tutor.
Is that gonna do it? Hm?

32:11.000 --> 32:12.365
Take care of that whole half
of her soul?

32:12.520 --> 32:14.443
What is it with you?
Why do you always have to go there?

32:14.600 --> 32:17.600
What is it with you that you don't wanna
admit that there's a "there" there?

32:18.680 --> 32:22.571
And you. You're a math tutor.
Is that it?

32:27.000 --> 32:28.525
He gets $25 an hour?

32:30.480 --> 32:32.209
Damn, that's a good business.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.362
- Is this Elliott's ride here?
- Yup.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.648
He's in the garage with your mom
and his bodyguard.

32:36.800 --> 32:38.450
Elliott has a bodyguard?

32:38.640 --> 32:40.847
He got himself some
fancy foreign bodyguard.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.650
The goofiest thing you've ever seen.

32:42.800 --> 32:44.609
Come on, Rowena, don't be stubborn.

32:44.760 --> 32:46.967
She's in one of the best schools
in the entire country.

32:47.120 --> 32:49.407
One of the safest neighborhoods
in Los Angeles.

32:49.560 --> 32:52.131
You and I know a different version
of the word "safe."

32:52.320 --> 32:54.971
That girl belongs down here
with her family, Elliott.

32:55.160 --> 32:56.400
You just want her away from me.

32:56.560 --> 32:58.210
You just want her...
That's all you want.

32:58.360 --> 33:01.125
You just want her away from us.
The black people.

33:02.080 --> 33:05.801
Now why... Why do you always
have to checkmate me with that shit?

33:06.000 --> 33:09.447
You always do this.
You always say something like that.

33:09.600 --> 33:12.604
How am I supposed to respond?

33:13.800 --> 33:15.768
After all your son put us through?

33:15.920 --> 33:19.811
The hell he unleashed on Carol
and my daughter, I think you'd...

33:19.960 --> 33:21.724
<i>l</i> think you'd have
the common sense to understand

33:21.880 --> 33:24.201
he can never be anywhere near her.

33:24.360 --> 33:26.044
Don't be coming down here lecturing me,

33:26.200 --> 33:28.601
all liquored up,
about common sense, Elliott.

33:28.760 --> 33:32.401
I'm this girl's grandmother
whether you like it or not, OK?

33:32.560 --> 33:34.449
- I'm just looking out for my babies.
- Yeah.

33:34.600 --> 33:37.683
My baby boy and my baby granddaughter.

33:44.040 --> 33:45.644
Ahh...

33:51.880 --> 33:54.247
- Bye, Elliott.
- See ya, Elliott.

33:54.400 --> 33:57.324
- Send Eloise our love, hear?
- Oh, no.

33:57.480 --> 33:59.562
No!

33:59.760 --> 34:00.761
Elliott, no.

34:00.920 --> 34:03.366
Elliott, that's not your car!

34:03.560 --> 34:05.961
- That's not your hooptie!
- Elliott.

34:06.120 --> 34:08.804
That way!

34:08.960 --> 34:09.960
Look at that.

34:12.400 --> 34:14.641
Yay! Bravo! Bravo!

34:18.480 --> 34:20.608
Make it home safe!

34:20.760 --> 34:25.641
I'd like to introduce you all
to my sister, Rowena.

34:25.800 --> 34:29.009
As you've all been briefed,
my sister has retained us...

34:29.159 --> 34:32.607
for a family custody matter.

34:32.760 --> 34:36.242
In front of you, you all have iPads
full of all the filing information

34:36.400 --> 34:38.926
we will have access to
in processing this case.

34:39.080 --> 34:44.962
Now this is, to us, obviously much more
than just a child custody hearing.

34:45.120 --> 34:47.121
It's much bigger than that.

34:47.280 --> 34:52.889
This will be argued as a breach
of a minor's rights to her family.

34:53.040 --> 34:54.485
To her people.

34:54.639 --> 34:57.166
Taken away by a man who,
for some reason,

34:57.360 --> 35:00.364
don't too much care for black folks.

35:00.520 --> 35:02.124
Wait a minute, Jeremiah.

35:02.280 --> 35:04.647
I didn't exactly say that.
I'm sorry.

35:04.800 --> 35:08.043
I mean, he lost his wife,
he lost his daughter,

35:08.200 --> 35:10.362
and he isn't sure he feels safe
with her down with us.

35:10.520 --> 35:13.524
Oh, he's got a problem
with black people.

35:13.680 --> 35:15.444
If he didn't,
we wouldn't be here, right?

35:15.600 --> 35:18.888
You'd be at home making
some kind of dinner for the child,

35:19.040 --> 35:20.610
helping her with her homework.

35:21.960 --> 35:25.123
Let's just say there was a nice
little white family, just like yours,

35:25.280 --> 35:29.569
but white, living in
a nice little white neighborhood,

35:29.720 --> 35:34.009
willing to pick up the responsibilities,
take care of the child.

35:34.160 --> 35:36.447
You mean to tell me that little girl
wouldn't have come to that funeral

35:36.600 --> 35:39.001
with her suitcases packed,
ready to go home with them?

35:42.560 --> 35:45.370
Now I give him credit for what he's
doing, taking care of the child and all,

35:45.520 --> 35:48.569
but he's only doing it because
he feels like he has no other option.

35:50.560 --> 35:53.450
- Do you want what's best for the child?
- Yes.

35:53.600 --> 35:56.922
Then he has a problem with black people.

35:57.880 --> 35:59.769
Now it's our job to make sure

35:59.920 --> 36:04.562
that he and the court
understand that very clearly.

36:23.960 --> 36:27.089
Elliott. So good to see you.

36:27.240 --> 36:28.890
It's good to see you too, Rita.

36:31.760 --> 36:34.491
I hope this means you'll be back.

36:34.640 --> 36:38.122
I'll be back. Not...
Not sure when just yet.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.567
The intel we have says
they're gonna come guns blazing.

36:40.760 --> 36:42.808
We think they even had something to do
with the seating of the judge,

36:42.960 --> 36:44.086
but that's just speculation.

36:44.240 --> 36:46.811
Either way, it's Cummins.
Judge Cummins.

36:46.960 --> 36:49.804
They got themselves a black lady judge.

36:49.960 --> 36:52.850
In family court,
you might as well close up shop now.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.162
A lady judge is always
gonna go with the mother.

36:55.320 --> 36:57.971
If there's no mother,
the state or the grandmother.

36:58.120 --> 37:00.964
And a black lady judge
is never gonna give a little black girl

37:01.120 --> 37:02.485
to a white grandfather.

37:03.960 --> 37:06.804
All right, let's talk about Rowena.

37:06.960 --> 37:09.531
She was born and raised in LA.
One of six.

37:09.680 --> 37:12.729
Never went to college.
She's a self-made woman.

37:12.880 --> 37:14.530
She has a real estate license.

37:14.680 --> 37:18.401
Owns about six businesses, three homes.

37:18.560 --> 37:21.530
She's raising three nephews, a niece.

37:21.680 --> 37:25.241
She has a daughter who lives across
the street, a gay woman and her wife.

37:25.400 --> 37:27.289
And then she's got the son,
Reggie Jr.

37:27.440 --> 37:30.284
He's been convicted three times
on felony drug charges.

37:30.440 --> 37:32.249
Pretty much is the bad apple
of the family.

37:32.400 --> 37:33.970
Oh, we'll find her weak spots.

37:34.120 --> 37:37.488
Get a couple of private investigators
shaking her tree for a week and a half

37:37.640 --> 37:41.167
and believe me, a lot more bad apples
are gonna fall out, no doubt about it.

37:41.360 --> 37:45.524
The point is,
are you OK getting ugly, Elliott?

37:45.680 --> 37:49.241
We can get a lot uglier than they can.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.562
Remember that, Elliott.

37:51.720 --> 37:53.722
You wanna keep your
little granddaughter,

37:53.880 --> 37:57.089
damn well bet
you're gonna do just that.

37:57.240 --> 37:58.969
Just give us the go-ahead.

38:06.400 --> 38:09.882
Something else I wanted
to talk to you about before you go.

38:11.400 --> 38:13.368
It's your drinking.

38:13.560 --> 38:16.166
This is my brother-in-law,
my sister's husband.

38:16.320 --> 38:18.209
He's in Alcoholics Anonymous.

38:19.840 --> 38:22.684
I don't have a drinking problem, Rick,
all right?

38:22.840 --> 38:24.365
I enjoy drinking.

38:24.520 --> 38:26.602
If it were a problem, I'd stop.

38:26.760 --> 38:28.444
Yeah, what do I know, right?

38:28.600 --> 38:30.682
I'm just the guy you brought along,
dragged up through the ranks,

38:30.840 --> 38:33.241
- I couldn't possibly know anything.
- I hope that's not the case.

38:33.400 --> 38:34.890
I picked you to represent me, right?

38:35.080 --> 38:36.889
You're about ready to get
dragged into a street fight here,

38:37.080 --> 38:38.600
with both hands tied behind your back,

38:38.720 --> 38:41.883
and the booze is gonna do its best
to make sure you lose Eloise.

38:42.040 --> 38:43.405
All right?

38:44.360 --> 38:45.930
Just call my brother-in-law.

38:47.240 --> 38:48.287
All right.

39:09.040 --> 39:11.611
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna make you pancakes.

39:11.760 --> 39:14.206
You're not the only one
who can make pancakes.

39:14.360 --> 39:15.600
Set the table, please.

39:20.360 --> 39:21.885
Puppy, do you ever...

39:23.040 --> 39:24.883
you ever think about
living somewhere else?

39:25.040 --> 39:26.041
Where?

39:26.960 --> 39:30.965
I don't know, maybe...
over there with Grandma Wee Wee?

39:31.840 --> 39:34.446
- With your cousins?
- Would you want that?

39:34.640 --> 39:35.971
For us to go live there?

39:36.120 --> 39:37.724
No, it wouldn't be me,
it'd just be you.

39:37.880 --> 39:39.644
I'd visit, you'd come back here, visit.

39:39.800 --> 39:42.201
But... you'd live with them.

39:42.400 --> 39:46.246
- Would that maybe be better?
- No.

39:46.440 --> 39:48.329
I don't like that.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.881
I like it here.

39:51.040 --> 39:52.530
With you.

39:52.680 --> 39:55.843
- With Rosita and my friends.
- I know, but maybe I'm like a...

39:56.840 --> 39:58.126
you know, I'm...

39:58.280 --> 40:00.681
You know, I'm just like an old guy, El.

40:00.840 --> 40:04.811
Don't you think a seven-year-old
should be hanging out with other kids?

40:05.000 --> 40:08.971
I'm with other kids all day long.
You're talking silly, Papa.

40:09.800 --> 40:11.962
Set the table, please.

40:16.840 --> 40:21.209
"'Who are you?' I ask,
and aim my watch light at the voices.

40:21.360 --> 40:23.840
The light reveals a mermaid.

40:24.000 --> 40:29.370
No, five mermaids, all with green
and orange swishing tails.

40:29.520 --> 40:33.411
The tops they're wearing look familiar,
but I can't figure out from where."

40:34.920 --> 40:37.810
- What?
- I love you, Papa.

40:41.120 --> 40:44.841
"'We're Lana's sisters, '
the one in the middle says.

40:45.040 --> 40:49.011
'She has short, butter-colored hair
and she's wearing a white..."

40:52.560 --> 40:54.767
Are you OK, Papa?

40:57.360 --> 40:59.203
I'm good.

41:00.040 --> 41:02.964
It's just a really sad story.

41:03.120 --> 41:07.921
It's not sad. It's about a mermaid
that takes her family on a vacation.

41:08.080 --> 41:12.165
No, I... I know.

41:12.360 --> 41:17.048
It just reminds me of another story.
A sad one.

41:19.120 --> 41:20.929
I just got sad.

41:21.840 --> 41:23.842
It's fine.

41:24.040 --> 41:28.409
"'We've been spying on her but we can't
get too close to the shore. ls..."'

41:31.000 --> 41:32.650
"'ls Lana OK?'

41:34.160 --> 41:37.721
'Not exactly, ' I say,
before explaining the whole story."

41:41.560 --> 41:44.131

Papa, are you sure you're OK?

42:20.080 --> 42:21.809
You seem like something's
wrong with you.

42:21.960 --> 42:26.249
No, baby, I'm fine.
Papa... Papa just had a rough night.

42:31.680 --> 42:32.966

42:35.640 --> 42:36.880

<i>GK.</i>

42:42.480 --> 42:43.766
Let's go.

42:45.160 --> 42:47.083
Where are you going?
You seem like something's wrong.

42:47.240 --> 42:49.561
Where are you going?
Why is Duvie all dressed up like that?

42:49.720 --> 42:52.929
I have a business thing this morning.
He's coming with me, OK?

42:53.080 --> 42:55.287
It's fine, honey, all right? It's fine.

42:55.440 --> 42:58.364
You've been drinking.
That's why Duvie has to drive.

42:58.520 --> 43:02.127
I told you.
I told you that I had a hard night.

43:08.480 --> 43:11.802
- What?
- Where are you going today?

43:11.960 --> 43:14.611
Just a business meeting, Puppy,
now get inside. Go on.

43:14.760 --> 43:16.603
Go on in the school.

43:42.400 --> 43:45.563
- What's she doing here?
- Who, Fay?

43:45.720 --> 43:47.160
Oh, she's never been in a courtroom.

43:47.200 --> 43:49.521
You really are a piece of work.

43:49.680 --> 43:51.489
This is their brief.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.890
You need to derail all this for me,
Rick.

43:56.040 --> 43:57.371
I don't know where Reggie is, OK?

43:57.520 --> 43:59.010
But when he comes back,
he's gonna want to take her.

43:59.160 --> 44:01.447
And I can't let that happen.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.526
- You've been drinking again?
- What makes you say that?

44:06.680 --> 44:09.445
Well, Hadji drove here,
your breath smells like Binaca,

44:09.600 --> 44:10.761
and you look like you spent the night

44:10.960 --> 44:13.964
getting dragged through
cobblestone streets by angry villagers.

44:14.120 --> 44:15.520
Other than that, I'm just guessing.

44:15.640 --> 44:19.565
- Hey.
- Fay, my name is Fay.

44:20.520 --> 44:22.204
I said, "Hey." As in hello.

44:22.360 --> 44:23.691
Hey.

44:25.080 --> 44:26.605
You gonna be all right in there?

44:31.040 --> 44:34.965
You go in there, all right?
And you get this done.

44:35.120 --> 44:36.485
You understand?

44:37.600 --> 44:40.968
- What's his problem?
- Ah, he's under a cloud of crap.

44:41.120 --> 44:43.009
- Hey, you excited?
- Yeah.

44:43.200 --> 44:45.771
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

44:45.920 --> 44:47.922
Who is the lead counsel
for the Jeffers family?

44:48.120 --> 44:52.250
- I am, Your Honor.
- And who is the lead for Mr. Anderson?

44:52.400 --> 44:53.401
I am, Your Honor.

44:53.560 --> 44:56.404
Rick... Rick Reynolds with Stacy,
Vertell, Anderson and Beighan,

44:56.560 --> 44:58.403
- on behalf of Elliott Anderson.
- OK.

44:58.560 --> 45:01.404
And I assume this is
Ms. Jeffers, your sister?

45:01.560 --> 45:03.847
Yes, Your Honor.
Pleased to meet you.

45:04.560 --> 45:08.963
OK. Um, I have your brief for parental
custody on behalf of Ms. Jeffers

45:09.120 --> 45:12.647
and I want you to know up front,
I think it's a bit of an overreach.

45:12.800 --> 45:14.131
Why aren't you asking
for shared custody?

45:14.280 --> 45:16.965
Well, Your Honor,
we feel that the child's environment

45:17.120 --> 45:20.329
is not conducive to her growing up
with a strong sense of self-esteem.

45:20.480 --> 45:24.644
We feel that she is in need of much more
support, community and history

45:24.800 --> 45:27.121
than she's currently getting
living with her grandfather.

45:27.280 --> 45:30.489
Well, unless you're gonna be making
some pretty serious claims

45:30.640 --> 45:33.007
about her grandfather,
who she's lived with her whole life,

45:33.160 --> 45:34.680
that you don't seem to be making here,

45:34.760 --> 45:37.127
I don't think we have enough
to warrant a hearing on full custody.

45:37.280 --> 45:39.931
I mean, not when we're talking
one grandparent to another, right?

45:45.200 --> 45:49.000
Uh... OK, anything else, Mr. Reynolds?

45:49.160 --> 45:51.003
Anything other than your briefs?

45:52.160 --> 45:55.240
Yes, only Your Honor, if I can quickly
tell you that Mr. Anderson and his wife

45:55.320 --> 45:59.006
went through a life-altering tragedy
when their 17-year-old daughter,

45:59.160 --> 46:00.605
completely unbeknownst to them,

46:00.760 --> 46:03.161
became pregnant
by Mr. Reginald Davis, Jr.,

46:03.360 --> 46:05.169
who at the time was <i>23</i> years old.

46:05.360 --> 46:07.044
The pregnancy was hidden
from them by their daughter

46:07.240 --> 46:09.242
for the first several months,
and then she was gone from them

46:09.400 --> 46:11.721
for the last several weeks,
hiding away at a friend's in shame.

46:11.880 --> 46:14.724
When she had the child,
the Andersons were not informed,

46:14.880 --> 46:18.680
and as such, were not at the hospital
when their daughter died,

46:18.880 --> 46:20.450
in a case of indirect maternal death

46:20.600 --> 46:24.286
that they felt would've been preventable
had they been present during the labor.

46:24.440 --> 46:26.044
Your Honor,
as horrible as this may be,

46:26.200 --> 46:28.520
it has no bearing on the custody
of the child at this time.

46:28.680 --> 46:29.880
Actually, it does, Your Honor,

46:30.000 --> 46:33.402
because it speaks loudly to the roots
of Mr. Davis' track record as a father,

46:33.600 --> 46:34.840
starting from the night she was born.

46:35.000 --> 46:38.163
Your Honor, our petition
has nothing to do with Reggie Davis.

46:38.320 --> 46:40.891
It's on behalf of his family.
His mother.

46:41.040 --> 46:42.769
His mother has nothing to do with him?

46:42.920 --> 46:45.321
Not at this time, Your Honor, no.

46:45.480 --> 46:49.280
My boy is in pain, Your Honor.
He's a good boy.

46:49.440 --> 46:51.727
He's lost. He's trying.
But he isn't the issue.

46:51.880 --> 46:55.885
The issue is this man doesn't want
our family in our baby girl's life,

46:56.080 --> 46:57.730
and we just need to be.

46:57.880 --> 47:01.043
Now she has to be living with us.
That's all there is to it.

47:01.200 --> 47:03.931
Also, Your Honor, sad to have to say,

47:04.080 --> 47:06.651
he's got himself a drinking problem
that needs to be looked into.

47:06.840 --> 47:09.241
Just as a side note, your people
got some work on their hands

47:09.400 --> 47:11.482
looking into that, if you ask me.

47:11.680 --> 47:12.886
The man can drink.

47:13.040 --> 47:17.125
Mr. Jeffers,
if we do go ahead and move to hearing,

47:17.280 --> 47:21.330
that... that's not gonna happen again,
am I right?

47:21.520 --> 47:23.921
- 'Cause I won't put up with that.
- You are correct, Your Honor.

47:24.080 --> 47:25.809
It... It won't happen again.

47:43.040 --> 47:46.601
OK, the clerk will schedule
a family custody hearing

47:46.800 --> 47:49.644
and I'm gonna order psychiatric
evaluations of young Miss Anderson.

47:49.840 --> 47:53.845
And please beware, all of you,
that when we go down this road,

47:54.000 --> 47:58.324
the state has custody options
other than the Jeffers and Mr. Anderson,

47:58.520 --> 48:01.888
so we will all be very courteous
and respectful.

48:02.040 --> 48:03.565
All right?

48:03.720 --> 48:05.404
All rise.

48:10.960 --> 48:13.327
Seemed like that did not go so well.

48:13.480 --> 48:14.481
Yeah.

48:14.640 --> 48:17.166
Have you thought about
learning a new language?

48:17.320 --> 48:21.006
When I am low, or in a place in my life
where I cannot make things happen

48:21.160 --> 48:23.003
the way I want them to happen,

48:23.160 --> 48:26.846
sometimes to busy myself,
I teach myself a new language.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.844
It really seems to help me
feel more at ease.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.765
Even if truly I am just distracted.

48:32.920 --> 48:35.526
Duvan, tell me the truth.

48:35.720 --> 48:37.688
What planet are you really from?

48:37.840 --> 48:41.526
OK? I'm not gonna report you,
I just would like to know.

49:17.720 --> 49:19.882
Eloise, are you sure you're OK?

49:20.040 --> 49:23.044
You want to talk at all about
what you talk with the lady about?

49:24.480 --> 49:26.244
No. I'm OK.

49:27.480 --> 49:29.642
What do you talk about, honey?

49:31.440 --> 49:34.762
Uh, I don't know.
We talk about my daddy, I guess.

49:35.880 --> 49:38.360
If I have dreams of him.

49:38.520 --> 49:42.844
- Do you?
- Yes. Sometimes. Are you mad?

49:43.040 --> 49:45.964
No. Not at all.

49:46.120 --> 49:49.169
The lady said me wanting
to see my daddy would make you angry.

49:49.320 --> 49:51.084
The therapist said that to you?

49:51.240 --> 49:53.368
Actually, she asked me
if it would make you angry

49:53.520 --> 49:55.249
if I dreamed of seeing my daddy.

49:55.400 --> 49:58.324
- What did you say?
- I said I didn't know.

50:11.120 --> 50:13.282
I just dropped Eloise back at school.

50:13.440 --> 50:17.286
She had another one of those...
therapy sessions that the judge ordered.

50:17.440 --> 50:19.920
They're starting to get to her.

50:20.120 --> 50:22.282
She's changing, Rick.

50:22.440 --> 50:24.727
These people are getting in her head
and I don't like it.

50:24.880 --> 50:27.690
<i>OK, I'll get into it. Why don't
I swing by the house in like an hour?</i>

50:27.840 --> 50:30.286
We need to petition a judge on this,
all right?

50:30.440 --> 50:32.602
And I don't want these damn therapists
messing with her head.

50:32.800 --> 50:35.246
- We need <i>to limit</i> this.
- <i>All right. I'm on it, I'm on it.</i>

50:35.400 --> 50:38.370
Eloise.

50:38.520 --> 50:42.127
Eloise, this is the paper
you were supposed to turn in, right?

50:42.280 --> 50:45.523
- Didn't we work on this with Duvan?
- I don't remember.

50:46.400 --> 50:50.803
You have to finish this homework, honey,
all right? Isn't it due tomorrow?

50:50.960 --> 50:54.407
- I think it is.
- Well then, turn that thing off there.

50:56.000 --> 50:59.846
Turn it off,
and get to work on this now.

51:01.200 --> 51:05.285
Papa, you need to stop being so mad
all the time. It's not healthy.

51:11.080 --> 51:12.923
Very good, very good.

51:42.520 --> 51:44.682
You're back.

51:44.840 --> 51:47.411
You're back. I'm so glad.

51:49.440 --> 51:53.206
I have so much
I need to talk to you about.

52:02.200 --> 52:04.521
Rowena wants to take Eloise.

52:05.840 --> 52:09.686
Of course <i>I...</i> said <i>no.</i>

52:11.200 --> 52:13.202
That's what you'd do, right?

52:14.960 --> 52:18.362
I miss you so much.

52:20.240 --> 52:22.447
Don't go away again.

52:22.600 --> 52:23.965
<i>Please...</i>

52:39.840 --> 52:41.922
What did we say, hm?

52:43.240 --> 52:45.925
What did we say about watching cartoons?

52:46.080 --> 52:47.730
- I forget.
- No, you don't.

52:47.880 --> 52:50.804
We said no cartoons until
the homework's done. It's not done.

52:50.960 --> 52:53.088
Now, turn it off.

52:53.240 --> 52:56.767
Eloise, turn that thing off. All right?

52:56.920 --> 52:59.446
I'm being serious here, honey.
This is my serious voice.

52:59.600 --> 53:02.126
You're about to make Papa very angry.
Now turn it off!

53:03.560 --> 53:07.610
I'm gonna count to three.
I'm being serious. One... <i>two...</i>

53:07.760 --> 53:11.606
You listen to me when I'm speaking
to you, young lady, do you hear me, huh?

53:11.760 --> 53:13.285
Do you hear me?

53:13.440 --> 53:15.249
I don't know who you think
you're dealing with here,

53:15.400 --> 53:17.607
but I'm not gonna put up with it!

53:23.040 --> 53:25.566
- Eloise, come here.
- I don't want to live with you.

53:25.760 --> 53:28.161
I want my daddy.

54:14.840 --> 54:16.120
<i>Elliott, you gotta get down here</i>

54:16.160 --> 54:17.525
- <i>as fast as possible.</i>
<i>- What's up?</i>

54:17.680 --> 54:19.364
- <i>It's Reggie.</i>
- <i>What about him?</i>

54:19.520 --> 54:21.090
- He's here.
- Where?

54:21.240 --> 54:22.571
Here, in our office.

54:22.720 --> 54:24.563
He just showed up,
said it was important,

54:24.720 --> 54:27.371
<i>said he needs to see you.
You need to get down here.</i>

54:32.800 --> 54:35.167
Hey, Elliott.

54:36.280 --> 54:37.691
What's up?

54:39.880 --> 54:41.723
Follow me.

54:41.920 --> 54:44.685
Rita, I think this one's
gonna need some strong coffee.

54:49.240 --> 54:51.686
What do you want?

54:51.840 --> 54:55.640
Just, uh... wanted to say hey.

54:55.800 --> 54:58.531
Hey? Good.

54:58.680 --> 55:00.011
Now what do you want?

55:00.160 --> 55:02.811
Elliott, don't be all that way, man.

55:02.960 --> 55:05.042
I need you not to be
all harsh and shit, please.

55:05.200 --> 55:07.965
You came here, Reggie.
Now what is it that you want?

55:09.400 --> 55:11.926
I wanted to talk to you about the girl.

55:12.120 --> 55:13.963
- My daughter.
- Eloise.

55:14.160 --> 55:16.162
- Mm-hm.
- What about her?

55:16.320 --> 55:19.244
Well, I know from Rex and them
that my moms and Jeremiah and them,

55:19.400 --> 55:21.801
they wanna...
they wanna take her from you.

55:23.080 --> 55:24.969
There's gonna be a hearing and, um...

55:34.240 --> 55:37.369
I could just go ahead and say that
you should have custody of her, but...

55:37.560 --> 55:39.608
<i>l</i> just, I need some help now,
Elliott.

55:43.600 --> 55:44.647
I meant me.

55:46.160 --> 55:47.525
The coffee's for me.

55:55.200 --> 55:57.931
- I need some money, Elliott.
- Why am I not shocked?

55:58.120 --> 56:01.203
Why don't you get it from
your Uncle Jeremiah. He's a big shot.

56:02.200 --> 56:03.804
He don't think a whole lot of me.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.207
Mm-hm. What makes you think I do?

56:07.760 --> 56:10.843
What about your mother? I know you don't
have a problem taking money from her.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.520
Well, she's not gonna give me anything

56:12.600 --> 56:15.285
unless I come home
and do things her way.

56:15.440 --> 56:17.602
Why would I give you anything?

56:17.760 --> 56:18.966
Well, I thought...

56:20.000 --> 56:22.367
<i>l</i> thought that I could
make things easy on you.

56:22.560 --> 56:24.324
You know, just not
be around during all this.

56:26.680 --> 56:28.125
So you, um...

56:29.120 --> 56:30.485
you think by your staying here,

56:30.640 --> 56:32.642
it makes it easier for them
to take Eloise from me.

56:34.400 --> 56:38.928
Let me tell you something.
The girl, your daughter, Eloise,

56:39.120 --> 56:40.884
she's the only decent thing
you have going.

56:41.080 --> 56:42.730
- Yeah, I know, Elliott. I know that.
- No, you don't.

56:42.920 --> 56:44.160
You don't know shit, all right?

56:44.240 --> 56:45.730
You don't know your head
from your ballsack.

56:45.920 --> 56:48.320
I've half a mind to snap your neck
right now, you understand?

56:48.400 --> 56:49.447
I am clean, Elliott.

56:49.600 --> 56:51.648
I've been up in Seattle,
trying to get it together,

56:51.840 --> 56:52.887
- trying to stay clean.
- Bullshit.

56:53.040 --> 56:57.762
No, it's not bullshit.
I'm on a new path. And you got me wrong.

57:01.480 --> 57:02.845
I just...

57:04.000 --> 57:07.846
I'm just hurting with some debts, man,
and I could use a little help.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.923
And I'll go away, man,
for good this time.

57:20.240 --> 57:22.527
You aren't going anywhere.

57:22.680 --> 57:25.251
You be out at my house tonight
at 7:00 for dinner,

57:25.400 --> 57:29.689
with flowers, a gift,
and a strong line of bullshit.

57:29.880 --> 57:35.444
You come say hello to Eloise, OK?
Eloise. That's her name.

57:35.600 --> 57:37.568
She needs to see you.

57:37.760 --> 57:40.491
She wants to see me? Really?

57:41.960 --> 57:43.769
She's in a lot of pain.

57:48.680 --> 57:49.886
<i>REGGAE'. OK.</i>

57:51.000 --> 57:52.889
OK, 7200. I'll be there.

58:03.680 --> 58:07.207
Then we can talk some more, you and me?
About that... about the money?

58:07.360 --> 58:08.930
Get out.

58:09.080 --> 58:10.969
Now. Just get out!

58:25.200 --> 58:27.168
- Think I got everything.
- Yes.

58:28.800 --> 58:31.451
- I'm gonna shower.
- No rush.

58:37.920 --> 58:41.163
Wow. You look very, very pretty, Puppy.

58:41.320 --> 58:43.607
Did he say where he's been?

58:44.760 --> 58:46.569
Yes, he's been away on business.

58:46.720 --> 58:50.281
Did he say why he hasn't called?
All this time?

58:50.440 --> 58:53.444
There was a problem, um...
with the phones where he's been.

58:53.600 --> 58:54.681
He feels badly.

58:54.880 --> 58:57.804
But he's coming right now.
That's all that matters.

58:59.840 --> 59:02.969
- Right?
- Yes. That's all that matters.

59:04.080 --> 59:05.923
Why don't you go help Rosita
in the kitchen.

59:06.080 --> 59:07.081
<i>GK.</i>

59:08.080 --> 59:11.368
What you making for me,
my daddy and Papa?

59:11.520 --> 59:13.887
Potatoes and chicken.

59:33.480 --> 59:34.970
Rosita?

59:35.120 --> 59:37.771
Fix yourself a plate to eat,
bring it in here, sweetheart.

59:40.760 --> 59:45.402
I'm sorry, Puppy. He, uh...
He must've gotten held up or something.

59:45.600 --> 59:47.921
Can I be excused, please?

59:48.080 --> 59:50.287
Of course you can.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:42.244
You don't have to hide this, OK?

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:46.246
This is all I drink, you know that.
This is all I drink.

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:49.882
OK? You don't have to hide it.
It doesn't do me any good.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:54.802
I know you think it helps...
but it doesn't.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:57.406
You understand?

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.531
<i>Oh...</i>

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:05.210
Jesus.

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:24.648
- Who is it?
- It's Wee Wee, Elliott. Open up.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:30.885
Oh, Lord.

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:34.368
Please, God, give me a break.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:41.249
You said we were welcome any time
to come swimming, right?

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:44.885
Rowena, are you kidding me?

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.805
We came over to have a good time today,
Elliott. What do you say?

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.450
<i>- '</i> He)', guys!
- Hey!

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.449
Hey, baby.

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:57.243
Eloise, your grandmother's
brought over a pool party.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:01.365
Are you in the...
Are you in the mood to go swimming?

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.409
Yes! Can we? Please, Papa!
Please, Papa!

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:06.404
- Please, Papa?
- Please?

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.564
Of course.

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:12.166
- Come on in, everyone.
- Yay!

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:15.130
"DANKA DANKA")

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:23.765
- Hey, good morning.
- Thank you.

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:28.164
Welcome. Welcome.

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:30.288
Yeah!

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.004
Hey, Dondi, y'all get that table set up.
I'll be right back.

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:40.770
Whoo!

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:44.846
<i>Uh...</i>

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.846
Elliott, I need to tell you something.

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:53.088
Reggie's outside in the car.

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:56.687
Reggie's here now?

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.080
- Don't get upset.
- He's out...

01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:59.326
- Don't get upset.
- He's out front?

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.289
He told me about last night.

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:04.125
Now, Elliott, you need
to let the past be the past.

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:07.523
He's off all the drugs. He's cleaned up,
he's changing his whole life.

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:09.051
- Oh, please.
- It's true.

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:12.727
Look past that sour hangover attitude
you got wrapped around your face

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.882
and listen up for once.

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:18.362
Elliott, he's afraid
you're gonna get all up in his face

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:19.846
and embarrass him in front of Eloise.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.571
You know, you wouldn't know the truth
when it comes to this guy

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:26.167
if it came up behind you,
slapped you on your fanny.

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:34.528
Hey! What happened to you last night?

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:38.480
- Huh? Where were you?
- Man, I wanted to come.

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:39.766
- I just couldn't...
- You know what?

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.167
Actually, I don't give a shit.
Just get your ass in the house, Reggie.

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:44.084
Go on, Reggie.
You don't have to be afraid of me.

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.924
I wouldn't dream of embarrassing you

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.320
to make you look bad
in front of your daughter.

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:50.211
Listen, Elliott.
I wanted to be here last night.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:53.045
I did. You need to know that.

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.601
All I need to know
is you broke her heart again.

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:59.207
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- I am ashamed of myself, man.

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.527
All right, but you don't
make it easy, Elliott.

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:05.080
Every time I come around,
you just rain down hate on me, man.

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.600
- It makes it hard to come around.
- I'm sorry it's hard on you, Reggie.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.603
You want to blame it all on me now?

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:12.843
That's a load of shit.
That's like a mile-high load of shit.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.606
Man, I screwed up, OK?
I screwed up last night.

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:18.331
I couldn't come here and I couldn't
face up. All right? But I'm here now.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:21.404
But you're not here, Reggie.
All right? You're not here.

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:22.766
You're not in the house.

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:26.248
You're out here in the street,
sitting on your car, doing what?

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:31.167
Huh? What, catching some rays?
Shaking off last night's buzz?

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:33.368
You can go to hell, Elliott.
I'm not going in there.

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:36.126
Is that it?
You just gonna walk away now?

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:39.767
I do you the favor,
let you make up with your daughter

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:41.251
and you're just gonna walk?

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:42.640
Is that what you do? You're gonna...

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.040
What, are you gonna sulk?

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.248
You gonna sulk
all the way back to Compton?

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:49.364
You're unbelievable. You know?

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:51.488
You not only broke
your little girl's heart,

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:53.961
but you're killing your mother.

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.481
You can't do any worse than that,
Reggie.

01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.324
You know what? You need...

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:02.290
You need to quit acting like you're
some kind of little street nigger.

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:05.244
'Cause you're not.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.641
You come from a good family.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:17.528

Because the judge
is gonna look you in the eye

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:38.091

I don't think it's a good idea
to bring him into the mix.

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:04.967

I'm telling you, I'm clean now.

I don't believe you.

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:13.363
And if I don't believe you, the judge
sure as hell won't believe you.

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:14.971
Jeremiah, you need to listen to me.

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:17.088
This isn't about him doing drugs.

01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:18.651
He'll admit that he did 'em.

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:22.646
Hell, he'll take a damn drug test.
He's already said that.

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:25.246
He's changed.
And he just wants to be with his baby.

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:28.927
He doesn't want to be with his daughter,
Rowena. That's the problem.

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:31.771
- You do, he doesn't.
- That ain't completely true, Uncle J.

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:34.161
Yes, it is!

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.049
You're a goddamn cliché.

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:38.931
You're a perfect stereotype.

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:42.209
You don't even realize
the damage you do.

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.442
Beyond the damage
you've done to that little girl.

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:48.321
You corroborate everything
the white community thinks.

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:52.451
You're a walking validation stamp
on all their bullshit.

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.689
You are a father. Goddamn you, Reggie!

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.842
You're a little girl's father!

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.844
And there's some broken chromosome
in that thick head of yours

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.601
that won't allow you to connect to that!

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:04.290
- I ain't like you, man, OK?
- Right!

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:05.680
- I'm not you!
- You're right!

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:07.161
- I'm not you! All right?
- Reg...

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:09.447
- Reggie, wait! Don't go.
- I'm done!

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:11.011
- Don't go!
- Jeremiah.

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.646
Now look,
if you wanna win custody from Elliott,

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:15.280
it won't help bringing him into this.

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:20.207
Now I say we go with my original brief,
you petition for custody.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.800
- He is the father.
- He doesn't want the job!

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:26.371
Will you please tell her, Andrea?

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:28.443
Auntie, you need to listen to him.

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.329
- Mm-mm! Mm-mm!
- He's right.

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.281
- Don't give me that look.
- I'm not giving you a look.

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:36.567
I don't care how many law degrees
you went and got,

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:38.600
doesn't give you the right
to give me that look.

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:40.569
There it is again. I mean it.

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:43.451
Now I'll get Daddy on the phone
and he'll tell you what's what.

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:44.965
Giving me a look.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.729
Oh, is that what you want?

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.882
You want a call coming in
from your dad? You know what?

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:51.405
Let me just get him on the phone.

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:52.800
You know what, Rowena?

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:55.566
You're damn hard to take.
Always have been.

01:11:55.720 --> 01:12:00.203
And I have to say this,
you're not getting any goddamn easier.

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:04.562
I was going to the water well
one day for my mother.

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.927
It's a everyday activity.

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:10.163
So I was walking back to my village
and I could hear something in the bushes

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:12.926
and I turn around and a gazelle
was headed in my direction.

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.242
- I gotta take this.
- Of course, of course.

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.164
I started to...

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:19.368
Well, of course,
I started to run very, very fast.

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:20.561
What's up?

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.085
<i>They've refiled
under a different chain.</i>

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:24.971
- What?
- It's Reggie's complaint now.

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:27.282
Filing for full parental custody.

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.647
- No, how can that be?
- <i>Gets</i> worse.

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:33.441
They submitted to the court a copy
of a check Reggie cashed for $25,000

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:34.647
made out from you.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:35.926
<i>It's gonna play really badly</i>

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:38.327
<i>if you were trying to bribe him
to walk away from his daughter.</i>

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:39.720
<i>I think you better come in tomorrow.</i>

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:42.247
We need to discuss this as a group.

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.164
It's about to go real bad, real fast.

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:45.970
All right, thanks.

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.528
So I'm running very, very fast

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:53.246
with having these three gazelles
chasing me down.

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:55.641
- Did not know what to do.
- Are you OK, Papa?

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:57.325
Yes, I am.

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:06.364
Duvan, I was thinking maybe...
you could teach me a language.

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:09.887
Sure. Which language?

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:12.088
I don't know. You just pick.

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:14.487
Papa, are you being silly?

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:19.123
No. I think he is being very serious.

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.731
I think he needs to learn a new trick.

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:30.128
It wasn't a goddamn bribe, all right?
He asked for the money.

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:33.921
I gave it to him in the hopes
that he'd get his act together.

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:38.801
- Whatever it was, it was a bad move.
- Mm-hm.

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:41.122
Yeah, puts us in a tough situation.

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.521
We need to think about
how this is gonna play in court.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.364
Play in court?

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:47.560
You got a young black kid
who's cleaned up his act,

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:50.968
he's got a sweet little mother
and her little niece,

01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:54.010
and all the little cousins,
and here comes Mr. Big...

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:57.010
Big ol' white guy with a checkbook,
bossing everybody around.

01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:59.931
That's the story
they're gonna tell right there.

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.168
This isn't about black and white,
all right?

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:06.086
This is about right and wrong,
all right? He's a drug addict.

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:08.481
Look, we know that, Elliott.

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:10.324
And she's gonna know it
before we're done.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:13.051
You just, you gotta keep your cool.

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.248
This isn't gonna be one of those times

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:19.041
where you can just bulldoze
through everything, Elliott.

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:21.729
- What did you just say to me?
- Hey, Elliott, hang on.

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:23.211
We're all on the same team here, guys.

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.727
He destroyed my daughter, Eldridge.
He destroyed my little girl.

01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:29.646
I'm not gonna let him
do the same to my granddaughter.

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:37.045
We're gonna go in there and we're gonna
remind this judge who Reggie Davis is.

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:39.049
We're gonna use his criminal record.

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:40.890
You're gonna need to bring it up
every third sentence.

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:44.084
We're gonna make this guy
wear it like a badge!

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.725
You start attacking this kid

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:49.161
- and the game is already over.
- Oh, for the love of God.

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:51.004
- He's not a kid.
- Look, Elliott...

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:53.401
He's 30 years old.

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:57.565
Nobody is arguing with you here.
It's just the world we're living in.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:01.207
We're just not gonna get away with
making it about him.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.925
If it isn't about him,
then it's gonna be about me.

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:30.090
- Eloise!
- Mr. Elliot, I am here.

01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:33.602
Mr. Elliott, her father came.

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:37.082
He took her and he say
he will bring her back by dinner.

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:39.447
But I didn't know what to do.

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:44.405
It's OK.

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.166
Hey!

01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:37.051
What the hell are you doing?

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:54.121
Don't you ever come into my house again
without my permission. You hear me?

01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:58.441
And don't you come anywhere
near that girl again anywhere,

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.523
unless I have plenty of warning
about it, you understand?

01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:02.648
- She's my daughter, man.
- Did you hear what I just said?

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.086
Yeah, yeah, I hear you.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.361
Good.

01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:33.284
- What the hell was that about?
- I got no idea.

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:34.851
All right?
I was up there having some laughs

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.809
and the dude came out of nowhere
and attacked me. All right?

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:38.803
I told you,
he's a special kind of crazy.

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:40.246
You told me you had permission
to go get her.

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.681
- I got permission from the maid.
- The maid?

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:46.851
Mama, I just...

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:49.600
<i>l</i> just wanted to be with her.

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:52.160
What the hell were you doing up there
with them if you wanted to be with her?

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.921
Why aren't you over there with her,
baby?

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:56.405
I don't know.

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:11.321
So sweet of him to bring Eloise over
for a crack-smoking field trip.

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.847
But she has to get home now
and do her homework.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.968
There's no crack-smoking going on,
Elliott.

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:18.726
Just beautiful music. Don't come here
talking to me about crack-smoking.

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:20.882
Your son had no right to come in
and take her from my house.

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:22.440
He told me you gave him permission.

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:25.166
Well, your little angel lied, all right?

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.806
I'm gonna file a motion
with the court tomorrow

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:30.121
and get a restraining order against him.
He's a junkie.

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:32.851
- My son is not a junkie.
- He's a crack junkie, Rowena.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.685
- He never got over his daddy dying.
- Oh, please.

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:37.808
He's overcome that now, but...

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.525
He's gonna shine, Elliott.
Just wait and see.

01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:41.125
He's gonna shine.
He's gonna make us all proud.

01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:44.045
Well, you must've been pretty proud
when he paid you all back then, right?

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:46.601
What are you talking about, Elliott?

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:49.770
The $25,000 check
that you're all worked up about.

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:53.129
You know, the bribe?
That was for debts, Rowena.

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:58.650
How much of that did you see?
How much did any of you see?

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:03.246
You live in a blind spot
when it comes to your son.

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:09.366
Yeah? Why don't you just run on home
and have yourself a drink?

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:11.727
Good idea. You know, I think I will.

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:14.531
My son is not a junkie!
And you're a drunk!

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:16.808
- OK, thank you!
- Just run on home,

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:19.406
fill your bathtub with whiskey
and just soak in it.

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:21.767
Have yourself an old drunk man's
bubble bath!

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.928
- Got it!
- Good!

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:29.722
- Papa!
- What?

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:31.609
A mus!

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:35.521
Wow! An A plus. Look at that!

01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:37.529
Someone's been doing their homework.

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:41.730
Someone's been doing their homework!

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:53.286
Too fast.

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:09.810
<i>Hey.
- Hey.-</i>

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:12.691
I was out walking by, saw the light on.
What are you doing?

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:16.287
- Um... Learning French.
- Why?

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:18.647
Well, it's either that or get drunk,
I guess.

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:20.290
That's the most insane thing
I've ever heard.

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:22.602
- Yeah.
- Going to AA isn't easier than trying

01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:24.603
- to learn that shit? Gotta be kidding.
- OK, all right.

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:27.843
Let me put some pants on, all right?
Come on in.

01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:31.567
Kristen! Where's your brother?

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.404
I told him
I wanted to get to court early.

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:35.483
Give that judge a pretty picture
to look at.

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.006
Here.

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:45.281
Reggie!

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:51.609
All right, brother.

01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:00.483
Just having a cigarette,
trying to get my head together.

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:06.445
You know, the truth is, Mama, I don't
think I can handle this, all right?

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:08.682
Jeremiah just need
to get it put off or something.

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:10.649
What are you talking about?

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:13.007
It's too much, all right?

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:15.527
I can't sit up there
in front of a judge and a jury.

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:19.605
There's no goddamn jury, boy. Wake up!

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.760
You got to go in there
and fight for your daughter.

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:26.050
Look, I can't do it! All right?
I can't do it.

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.726
Now she need to just
stay up there where she is.

01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:32.884
Look, I wanna do it, Mama. I do.

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:35.646
I keep trying, but I can't.

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:37.365
All right? Jeremiah said it himself.

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:40.171
I'm not right that way.
There's something missing.

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.163
Shut your mouth!

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:48.407
Today is not the day
for you to lose sight of what's real.

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:51.769
This is a little girl's life
we're talking about.

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:54.400
She has a family.

01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:56.881
She has a father.

01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:02.325
And unless you let her know right now
that she's worth fighting for,

01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:05.882
she'll never feel in her little heart
that she's worth a damn.

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:08.207
You understand?

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:12.329
All of you.

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:15.245
You're all precious and perfect,

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:19.644
and every one of you would be worth
whatever the fight was to keep close.

01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:24.931
We don't want anything else
out of this cranky-ass old man,

01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:27.924
not one cent, not one concession,
you hear me?

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:31.801
We just want our blood close.
Your blood, Reggie.

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:35.127
Now she needs to be good with you.

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:38.051
She needs to be in your life, baby,
making you whole.

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:39.526
That's why you're so sick.

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:43.127
That's why you're so broken.

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:48.603
I love you. OK?

01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:56.122
Now pull yourself together.

01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:59.284
Pull yourself together!
You got a job to do.

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:01.761
Probably should've been doing that
a lot more while you were growing up.

01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:03.365
We wouldn't be in this situation.

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:07.206
Mr. Davis, when was the last time
you saw your daughter?

01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:09.931
About a month or two ago.

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:11.889
How did she seem to you at that time?

01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:13.849
She seemed good.

01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:16.727
A little lonely.

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:20.601
Kinda lost, maybe like she wanted
to say more, but thought she couldn't.

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:22.603
Say more about what?

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.523
I guess about living
with her granddaddy or something.

01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:27.444
Uh, Your Honor? Your Honor, if I may?

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:31.161
Eloise has had nine sessions
with the state's child therapist

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:33.004
and the Jeffers' stipulated
psychiatrist.

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:35.441
Not one of those reports came back
that Eloise was a child

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:38.962
who didn't feel safe enough to
say what was on her mind on any subject.

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:40.281
Move along, Counselor.

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:42.169
Thank you.

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:45.005
Mr. Davis,
just so the court has it straight,

01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:48.209
you do have a criminal record,
is that correct?

01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:50.840
Yes, sir, I do.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:56.530
Robbery, drug possession, assault,

01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:00.366
drug possession with intent to sell.
Did I leave anything out?

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:03.524
No, sir. That's... that's about it.

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:07.651
Mr. Davis, at one point,
you were smoking crack every day.

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:11.043
- Is that correct?
- Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:13.362
And why do you think that was?

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:16.683
What do you think led you
to taking all these drugs?

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:20.560
<i>I think I...</i>

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:23.964
I guess I just...

01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:28.649
I don't know, man. I don't know.

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:30.165
Emotional pain. Emotional...

01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:31.970
He was in pain, Your Honor.

01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:33.884
He let his family down, he lost his way.

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:36.761
The drugs were a way for the boy
to hide the pain of losing his daddy

01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:39.008
and letting his family down.

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:41.607
Ms. Jeffers?

01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:46.411
You open your mouth like that again,
you'll leave this room.

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:48.403
You may even have handcuffs on.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:50.801
Counselor, I'm not kidding, not one bit.

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:52.485
As impossible as the task may be,

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:57.043
you're gonna have to figure out
a way to control her, OK? Go on.

01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:00.568
How long have you been
clean from drug use, Reggie?

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:02.324
About two years.

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:05.563
I've been up in Seattle,
rebuilding my life.

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:08.923
Building a path back to my girl,
to my family.

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:10.684
And you have a job now, is that correct?

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:12.729
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
I work with my mother now.

01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:15.565
She, uh, she has a real estate business.

01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:18.246
She does some ad sales.
Plus, she got a website business.

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:20.329
Actually, she's got like six businesses.

01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:24.565
So, Reggie, at this time, do you feel
that you are able to take over

01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:27.087
the care and guidance of your daughter?

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:28.361
No.

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:32.286
I mean...
I mean, not yet, Your Honor.

01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:35.284
I think if she lived with my mother,
and I get some help from my sister

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:39.126
and her wife across the street
while I continue my rehabilitation,

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:41.601
I can slowly grow into a relationship,

01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:44.804
be the daddy and all that,
that I need to be.

01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:47.444
Thank you, Reggie.

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:49.284
That's all for now, Your Honor.

01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:52.363
Little man, come here.

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:54.289
One second, Your Honor, please?

01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:57.084
Call for a lunch break.

01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:00.084
He looks... like he needs some air.
He looks a little fidgety.

01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:01.720
We can't do that now. It's too early.

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:04.081
If we call for lunch,
it'll just underline to the judge

01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:06.931
- how hard all this is on him.
- He needs a break.

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:10.129
- We can't do that.
- Call for a break.

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:13.687
Rowena, you are damn hard to take.

01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:20.325
Your Honor, we were wondering
if we could break early for lunch now

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:23.006
before counsel takes
its testimony from Mr. Davis?

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:24.600
Mr. Reynolds, any problem with that?

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:27.325
We want to cross now.

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:30.324
All right, I'm worried the judge is
gonna see that as you being belligerent.

01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:32.721
Now is not the time
to go light on this guy.

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:35.247
I have a question I want him to answer.

01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:42.970
He wants to go with this.

01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:44.929
No, Elliott, no.

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:47.970
No, not after lunch.
Now. I want to ask him now.

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:51.966
Uh, Your Honor, seeing as how thorough
Mr. Davis' lawyer has been,

01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.650
we only have a couple of questions.

01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:55.401
So if we can just
move ahead of schedule,

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:57.840
we feel we can get to Mr. Anderson's
testimony after lunch.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.365
That's fine. Go ahead.

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:03.127
Mr. Davis, you have a tenth grade
high school education.

01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:04.881
You can read pretty good, is that right?

01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:10.051
Yeah. Yeah, I read fine. I just...
I don't have time and all, but...

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:12.202
And how is your spelling?

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.249
I'm OK with my spelling.

01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:19.042
OK, so, how would you
spell the name... Eloise?

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:24.486
Your Honor, please, this has
nothing to do with why we're here.

01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:27.206
I want to hear him spell it.

01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:32.530
Go ahead, Mr. Davis,
spell your daughter's name.

01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:33.681
<i>REGGAE'. OK.</i>

01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:39.807
Um...

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:45.885
<i>L...</i> Right?

01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:48.771
L-O-E-Z-E.

01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:51.085
Eloise.

01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:56.770
- OK, Mr. Reynolds, anything else?
- No, Your Honor. Thank you.

01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:58.763
That's lunch.

01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:00.410
All rise.

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.966
- How old are you, Mr. Araga?
- I am 19.

01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:10.088
And you are Miss Anderson's tutor?

01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:12.567
Yes, I tutor Eloise.

01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:18.284
Basic mathematics, division, Algebra,
introductory grammar skills.

01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:20.283
And I understand you speak languages.

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:21.965
How many languages
do you speak, Duvan?

01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:27.160
Currently, uh, there are nine languages
that I would call myself fluent in.

01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:29.971
I have four others
that I struggle through.

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:32.248
Your Honor, I have written a paper

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.926
on language learning
as a system of tension release

01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:37.447
for the North American
Board of Mental Health Physicians.

01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:39.290
<i>GK.</i>

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:40.805
Thank you.

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:46.000
So, Mr. Araga, when you tutor Eloise,
where's her grandfather?

01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:50.006
- Is he in the other room?
- Oh, no. He is with us.

01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:52.480
- He is being tutored as well.
- He's right there with you.

01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:56.246
Yes, I have a combination package
on tutoring two people at once

01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:58.562
that I have worked out
with Mr. Anderson.

01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:01.291
So would you say that he is very
involved in Eloise's studying?

01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:03.329
Extremely involved.

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:05.084
Would you say more or less
than the other parents

01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:07.049
- whose children you work with?
- Oh...

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:09.646
I would say much, much more.

01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:11.401
Thank you.
That's all, Your Honor.

01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:16.890
Mr. Araga, what other services
do you provide for Mr. Anderson?

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:22.922
I tutor Eloise, piano lessons,
and I am also sometimes his driver.

01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:25.651
Oh. Why does he need a driver?

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:31.250
Sometimes, he will call me
to come and drive for him and I do.

01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:33.647
It is not on any of the lists
that I have given you,

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:36.929
because it is not
a standard service that I offer.

01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:41.802
What condition is he in
when you are required to drive for him?

01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:48.410
I suppose maybe he is tired or...
has a lot on his mind?

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:50.847
Does Mr. Anderson
have a drinking problem?

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:56.245
I am not an expert on alcohol
or substance abuse detection

01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:58.767
or even addiction control issues.

01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:02.129
It is not something that I have
gotten into as a field of study

01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:03.691
for either work or recreation.

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:06.571
Obviously not.
You haven't written a paper on it.

01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:14.491
Mr. Araga, have you ever
seen Mr. Anderson intoxicated?

01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:19.809
Mr. Araga?

01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:27.041
Yes, I have.

01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:32.286
Have you ever seen him intoxicated
in front of his granddaughter?

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:36.403
He is currently learning French
as an alternative activity...

01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:40.360
Mr. Araga, have you ever
seen Mr. Anderson intoxicated

01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:43.091
in front of Eloise?

01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:44.287
Yes or no?

01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:49.850
- Yes.
- More than once?

01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:53.769
- Yes.
- Thank you, Mr. Araga.

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:55.809
Your Honor, no further questions.

01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:10.160
All right, now Jeremiah's
gonna come after you.

01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:13.608
He's gonna do his best to try
to pick you apart, piece by piece, <i>so...</i>

01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:14.761
Really?

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:16.564
Just, please, when you're on the stand,

01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:19.525
your number one job
is just to not lose your cool.

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:22.849
Just stop, all right? Don't talk to me
like I'm a two-year-old, OK?

01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:27.441
You know...

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:31.963
<i>l</i> talked to my brother-in-law
about your drinking.

01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:35.124
He asked me how long
you've been drinking like this.

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:38.642
I was like,
"I don't know, last couple years or so."

01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:42.001
You know, kind of since
your daughter, uh...

01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:44.931
And you know, how it got more serious
once Carol passed.

01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:47.521
- And you know what he said to me?
- No, what'd he say?

01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:51.644
He said,
"Maybe this guy's not an alcoholic.

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:56.283
This guy, maybe he's just
one seriously angry motherfucker.

01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:58.602
Maybe he's just hopped up on anger."

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:03.690
Well, if you are? if that is your drug
of choice, Elliott, I'm telling you,

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:07.003
today is not the day
to go off on a bender.

01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:09.731
OK?

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:16.491
And when was the first time
you met Reginald Davis Jr.?

01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:19.120
A couple of years
after Eloise was born.

01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:25.126
After we lost Jill, he came over
one day, wanted to talk to me alone.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.571
- What did he want?
- He wanted some money.

01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:30.245
That's what it usually is with Reggie.

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:32.448
And for what purpose did he think
you were going to give him the money?

01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:36.286
I assume he wanted it in exchange
for not contesting custody of the baby.

01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:39.364
- Your Honor, that's wildly speculative.
- I agree.

01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:43.241
- Did he meet Eloise that day?
- No, I wouldn't let him in.

01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:46.449
He was a mess. I told him to come back
after he'd cleaned himself up.

01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:50.087
- Did he come back?
- A few weeks later, yeah.

01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:51.730
And had he cleaned up?

01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:56.204
More or less. He showed up...
He showed up with Rowena.

01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:58.880
- His mother.
- Yes.

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:02.408
She basically dragged him there with
his ear in between two of her fingers.

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:07.441
And how much time did they spend
with Eloise that day?

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:10.126
Hour or so.

01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:12.408
Just long enough for Reggie
to steal a watch.

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:16.690
How do you know he stole a watch?
Isn't that "wildly speculative"?

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:19.087
No, his mother brought him back
with it the next day.

01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:21.561
Made him return it to me.

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:24.001
When was the next time
you saw him?

01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:28.529
Six months or so later, he came over
in the middle of the night.

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:32.042
About three a.m., wanted to take
the baby, said she was his.

01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:33.725
Wanted her right then and there.

01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:35.609
How would you describe
his condition that night?

01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:38.286
He was agitated.

01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:40.130
High. Stoned on something.

01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:42.004
And of course, you wouldn't
give him your granddaughter.

01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:44.083
- No, of course not.
- How did he handle that?

01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:46.442
He attacked me.

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:47.761
Pulled a knife on me.

01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:49.604
How did that end up?

01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:54.482
I managed to cool him down.
Carol called the police. He ran.

01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:56.324
She called the police.
So there's a police report?

01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:58.244
Yes.

01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:00.971
- Did you press charges?
- No.

01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:03.521
Were there any more instances
like that again?

01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:04.681
Yeah, a couple.

01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:09.568
He has a tendency to get violent
for no reason when he's on drugs.

01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:11.171
How often did you see his mother?

01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:13.607
We'd see her a bit.

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:16.764
She and Carol worked out
some form of a relationship.

01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:17.921
We were fine with her.

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:21.448
Why is it you didn't meet Mr. Davis
until the baby was two years old,

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:23.329
if your daughter had been dating him?

01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:25.801
I don't think he actually dated her.

01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:29.521
The term I'd use <i>is...</i> abused.

01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:32.968
Mr. Anderson, don't confuse
your answer with an opinion. It's not...

01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:36.289
She was only 17 years old, Your Honor.
He was 23.

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:38.602
We could very easily be using
a whole different term

01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:42.526
to describe that relationship, but we
didn't press charges there either.

01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:46.049
She was a goddamn baby.

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:57.566
Mr. Anderson, how often have you been
to work since your wife passed away?

01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:01.242
Not a lot.

01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:02.885
I'm taking some time off.

01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:05.691
You've taken an emotional leave?

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:08.849
Needed time to heal?

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.729
If you did, that would make sense.

01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:13.167
The reason I haven't
been working is Eloise.

01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:15.209
So you think
it's better for you to be at home,

01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:16.771
help her with her studies.

01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:19.446
I do.

01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:21.280
And luckily,
you're in a financial position

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:25.490
to be able to maintain the lifestyle
that you and Eloise enjoy?

01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:26.641
Yes.

01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:29.650
You're also in a financial position
that if need be,

01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:31.808
you can do this permanently?

01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:35.124
No?

01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:38.284
So eventually,
you'll be back to work full-time.

01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:40.641
Yeah.

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:43.720
Your Honor, will you please instruct
the witness to answer these questions

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:46.730
with yes's and no's?
We do have a transcript.

01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:49.486
Is that a yes or a no, Mr. Anderson?

01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:52.405
Yes, eventually,
I will have to go back to work. Yes.

01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:57.407
So all of this, all of the tutoring,
all of the full-time parenting,

01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:00.530
as good as it is, someday soon...

01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:04.086
things will be a lot different
for Eloise, right?

01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:07.483
You won't be able to devote to her
the energy that you have been,

01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:09.244
is that right?

01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:12.768
Please answer the question,
Mr. Anderson.

01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:15.730
I'd love to, Your Honor, but if he's
gonna continue to do it for me,

01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:17.928
- I might as well just sit down.
- OK, OK, OK. OK.

01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:20.162
This does not need to be that difficult.

01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:22.766
Counsel, you may want
to rephrase the question,

01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:27.482
and Mr. Anderson, you need to try not
to be so sensitive. All right?

01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:31.761
- Can he go on?
- Yes, he can go on.

01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:33.684
<i>GK.</i>

01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:36.810
Mr. Anderson, I'd like to submit
to you and the court

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:41.010
that Reggie isn't gonna win the
Father of the Year Award anytime soon.

01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:45.603
- I don't think so, either.
- But he is Eloise's father.

01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:50.129
I've read the reports from her sessions
she had, and I know you did as well.

01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:54.001
This is a girl who hungers
for a relationship with her father.

01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:57.323
- Do you agree?
- I do. Especially now,

01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:00.131
since she's lost her grandmother.

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:04.530
One of her grandmothers.

01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:09.442
Yes. One of her grandmothers.

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:13.571
Mr. Anderson, how different would
you feel about Reggie's failings...

01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:16.365
if he were white?

01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:19.967
OK, here we go.

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:23.369
Not one damn bit.

01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:26.205
All right? This isn't about
anything even close to that.

01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:28.249
I think you'd know better.

01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:34.248
Elliott, did you refer to Reggie...
as a "street nigger"?

01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:52.528
Yes, I did, once.
I was heated, but... yes, I did.

01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:55.889
It was a mistake.
I wish I hadn't done that, said that.

01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:58.008
You were heated,
but you did use the term.

01:38:58.200 --> 01:38:59.565
I just said I did.

01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:02.200
It's an ugly word,
and I'm ashamed that I used it.

01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:04.840
I know it's hurtful
and I shouldn't have, but...

01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:07.529
it's the word he used.

01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:12.451
It's how he referred to himself in all
his texts on her phone that I found,

01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:13.601
my daughter's phone.

01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:16.531
"Your street nigger's here, baby.
Come on out."

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:20.691
"Your street nigger,"
that kind of thing, Your Honor.

01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:22.444
I know it doesn't make it right,

01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:26.201
but it was just in there,
lodged up here and it came out.

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:29.250
In reality, though,
isn't that how you see him?

01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:35.406
A little drugged-out street nigger?

01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:39.928
Isn't that exactly to a tee
how you see Reggie?

01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:48.446
Mr. Anderson...

01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:53.447
do you dislike black people?

01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:56.483
Not all of them.

01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:00.842
Do you have a problem
with racial prejudice?

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:06.245
Is that what you want to
make this about, Jeremiah? Really?

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:08.607
Well, let's do it then.

01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:10.888
You've wanted to ever since
Rowena first dragged you into this.

01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:16.171
So yes, we're different, you and I.
You want to submit that? Submit it.

01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:17.646
We have different skin color.

01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:21.600
Is that the first thing I notice when I
see a black man, the color of his skin?

01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:25.924
Yes. Submit away.

01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:28.851
Because I can go ahead and submit
that it's the first thing you see

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:31.361
when you see a white guy.
Now I don't know why that is

01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:34.444
any more than I know why
when I see a good-looking woman,

01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:37.763
the first thing I notice
are her breasts. Because I do.

01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:41.049
But if I move onto
my next thought quick enough,

01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:44.409
I'm not a pervert, all right?
I'm not a... I'm not a bad guy.

01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:47.809
I'm just... I'm just mildly flawed.

01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:52.084
It's the same thing with race.
It's not my first thought that counts,

01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:54.129
it's my second,
third and fourth thought.

01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:57.204
And each and every case I'm in,
it comes down to the same thing:

01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:59.323
the action and interaction I'm having

01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:01.642
with the person
that I'm interacting with.

01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:04.929
The interaction I've had with Reggie,
in case you haven't noticed,

01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:07.202
hasn't been all that great.

01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:10.170
And I don't need a math tutor to know
that it doesn't make me a racist

01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:13.005
just because he's a crack addict.

01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:18.009
That column doesn't add up.
It just simply totals him out as a...

01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:21.646
a drug-addled criminal,
a liar and a...

01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:25.600
a thief with no moral compass.

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:30.004
He may be able to play you,
fool his mother,

01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:32.766
may be even able to
get one over here on Judge Cummins.

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:36.447
But he can't fool me, because I see him
for exactly what he is.

01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:41.401
And to this day, he's never once
apologized or shown one bit of remorse

01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:44.882
to me or my wife
for the death of our daughter.

01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:47.122
All right?

01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:49.123
His mother wants to
mollycoddle him, fine.

01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:50.361
The whole world wants to treat him

01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:52.682
like a wounded, put-upon child,
then do it.

01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:54.444
I don't really care.

01:41:56.600 --> 01:42:00.002
I just don't want him infecting Eloise.

01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:03.931
So, no, Jeremiah,
I'm not racially prejudiced,

01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:07.368
I just don't happen to want your
little nephew's broken-down black ass

01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:11.286
anywhere near my granddaughter.
What's your next question?

01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:20.210
I don't think I have one.

01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:40.405
I don't think that went
as bad as you think it did.

01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:44.770
She'll make a ruling in a few days.
Who knows, she may even surprise us.

01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:47.241
I couldn't have been
a worse witness if I tried.

01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:52.085
No way in hell she's not gonna
take Eloise away from me.

01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:54.645
Not a shot in hell.

01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:56.768
Ah, come on, you were great.

01:42:56.920 --> 01:42:59.924
Not a lot of the other Klan members
could be that articulate.

01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:16.009
Time to turn
the lights out, Puppy.

01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:18.686
Want to see my new drawing?

01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:26.647
That's you, me and Daddy.

01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:32.450
You're very talented.

01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:35.091
Now lay down.

01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:41.643
- Did we do good in court today?
- We did OK.

01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:45.646
Did you tell the lady judge
that I only want to live with you?

01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:48.485
That I love Wee Wee and them,
but this is where I am?

01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:51.564
- Yes, I told her.
- Did she hear you?

01:43:56.440 --> 01:44:00.206
- I think she did.
- Good.

01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:07.123
Son of a bitch.

01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:12.245
You better get your ass out of here
right now, Reggie.

01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:15.210
Give me money. A lot of money. Fifty.

01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:17.408
You make it 50 and
I'll go away for good this time.

01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:19.085
You need to leave right now.

01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:20.685
You give me the money
and I'll just go away.

01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:24.447
- You hear me? You need to leave now!
- Give me the money!

01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:27.444
- Or I'll take my daughter right now.
- Hell you will.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.206
Get out of here!

01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:39.088
You don't ever come over here
like this again! You hear me?

01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:40.969
Never, ever!

01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:18.288
All you're ever gonna do is hate on me.

01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:21.725
I know that.

01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:27.330
I ain't gonna never be nothing
but a street nigger to you. Never.

01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:17.681
<i>- Oh...</i>

01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:55.727
Elliott! Elliott!

01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:58.565
Elliott!

01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:35.522
I'm so sorry, Elliott.

01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:40.124
I'm sorry about
you losing your little girl.

01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:42.926
God, I'm so sorry.

01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:46.561
I'm so sorry.

01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:52.644
I'm so sorry.

01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:31.809
OK, so, as you know, I was ready
to issue a custody ruling in this case,

01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:35.089
but I understand that both sides
would like to address the court

01:51:35.240 --> 01:51:38.961
with some additional information.
So, uh, let's first hear from Mr. Davis.

01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:43.249
Your Honor,
I just want to say that, um,

01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:47.086
the things that Mr. Anderson
said about me last week,

01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:50.642
they were hard to hear,
but they were true.

01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:53.610
I ain't fit just yet to be a father.

01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:56.286
I ain't no good to be around my girl.

01:51:56.480 --> 01:52:01.964
I need to go away, or something.
Get some air. Learn how to breathe.

01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:04.645
Figure out how to just...

01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:09.685
how to live like somebody
worth having a little girl lives like.

01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:11.808
I don't want the custody.

01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:17.771
That's the real truth.

01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:24.286
Well... that is an interesting turn.

01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:27.171
So, um, Mr. Anderson,

01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:29.766
I understand that you have something
I need to know as well,

01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:32.321
something about an incident
at your house?

01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:37.087
No, Your Honor,
there's nothing I need <i>to...</i>

01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:40.249
nothing I need to say
at this point.

01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:45.491
OK, so, Counselor,
are you now back to asking me

01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:47.921
to give custody to your sister,
is that where we're going?

01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:50.566
Yes, Your Honor, we'd like to revert
back to our original brief,

01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:54.167
asking that Rowena Jeffers
be given full custody of the child.

01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:57.130
- OK. Now...
- No.

01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:01.569
Your Honor, that's not what we want.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.321
I know I'm not supposed to just
stand up and blurt things out in here

01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:09.370
and I really don't want
to go to jail today, but...

01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:14.331
<i>l</i> need to say that I was wrong
about Eloise's grandfather.

01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:16.482
I need to say that right now.

01:53:16.680 --> 01:53:19.126
I believe he has
her best interest at heart.

01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:21.521
- You do?
- I mean, he's got himself a cranky side

01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:24.160
and he drinks too much,
which he needs to work on that, pronto.

01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:26.885
But I do trust him
with my granddaughter.

01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:29.520
I'm not going to jail
for saying any of this, am I?

01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:33.924
Not today. So you want to sit?
Yeah. There you go. Thank you.

01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:35.889
OK, now this is all very interesting.

01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:39.169
So Mr. Davis, are you sure
that this is what you want?

01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:41.049
To give sole custody to Mr. Anderson?

01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:43.931
Because this will not be easy
to rescind once it's...

01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:46.765
That's fine, Your Honor, that's fine.
We trust Elliott.

01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:48.166
You won't have to rescind anything.

01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:50.766
Reggie understands that, don't you,
Reggie? I mean, it's all good.

01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:53.491
- It's all good.
- OK. Thank you.

01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:56.365
I would... like him to stop
with the drinking, though.

01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:59.763
OK, you know what, Your Honor?
I do need to quit drinking.

01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:01.524
All right? <i>I</i> got it. But it's...

01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:04.809
And it's not easy,
so please tell her to...

01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:09.602
Tell her to mind her own business.
Please?

01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:12.525
Y'all done?

01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:15.244
I am.

01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:18.529
I'm ready to sit back down, Your Honor.

01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:25.806
Jesus.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:30.130
All right, Mr. Anderson, you now
have full custody of your granddaughter,

01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:35.571
Eloise Anderson, in accordance with
California Family Code, Section 3040,

01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:39.321
paragraph three.
And for your granddaughter's sake...

01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:07.927
Hey, Eloise!

01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:17.403
- Just for a while. You promised. Right?
- Yes.

01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:19.449
A couple of weeks.

01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:22.962
I just need to get some air, Puppy.
It won't be long.

01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:25.925
Papa just...

01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:29.730
Papa just needs to relearn
how to breathe.

01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:32.042
Work on some things.

01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:34.771
- You understand that, right?
- Yes.

01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:37.764
Duvan is gonna come and
take you to school every day, OK?

01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:42.482
He's gonna help you keep up
with your studies. All right? Good.

01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:46.565
That's a pretty good-looking bow
you have up there. Wonder who tied it.

01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:47.721
You did.

01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:50.804
That's right.

01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:10.123
Hey, you. Come here. Mm-mm.

01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:13.090
Wee Wee's got some love for you.

01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:15.561
Come on, come on.

01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:43.201
You about done?

01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:46.011
Uh, yes. Yes, I'm done.
