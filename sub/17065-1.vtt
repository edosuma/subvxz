00:00.094 --> 00:02.256
<i>They say one day
a meteor will strike the Earth,</i>

00:02.281 --> 00:04.381
<i>obliterating life as we know it,</i>

00:04.406 --> 00:06.491
<i>but it's not coming
soon enough to help me.</i>

00:06.516 --> 00:07.998
<i>You see, my neighbor, Fat Pam,</i>

00:08.023 --> 00:09.857
<i>is giving up and moving to Vermont.</i>

00:09.882 --> 00:12.185
<i>She's had enough
of the skinnies in this town,</i>

00:12.210 --> 00:14.945
<i>and once Fat Pam is gone,
I am going to be the s...</i>

00:15.080 --> 00:16.163
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:16.282 --> 00:19.116
Anna-Kat! Do not pee in the yard!

00:19.251 --> 00:20.951
Mom, I've thought about it,

00:21.086 --> 00:22.286
and I refuse to participate

00:22.421 --> 00:24.288
in the school food drive on principle.

00:24.373 --> 00:26.290
And what principle is that?

00:26.375 --> 00:28.876
Westport homeless people
have better stuff than we do.

00:28.961 --> 00:31.345
Nude Norman rides a bike
that's worth more than our car.

00:31.447 --> 00:32.846
And when he does wear clothes,

00:32.965 --> 00:35.299
they're Ms. Halloran's
cashmere hand-me-downs.

00:35.434 --> 00:37.217
It's a little thing
called charity, Oliver.

00:37.303 --> 00:38.719
It's the worst thing for him.

00:38.804 --> 00:40.354
Nude Norman isn't gonna get a job

00:40.472 --> 00:42.689
if it's open season
on free cans of creamed corn.

00:42.714 --> 00:43.960
<i>I'm not gonna lie to you...</i>

00:43.985 --> 00:46.217
<i>We boned it pretty bad with this one.</i>

00:46.278 --> 00:49.029
<i>Oliver has one goal in life...
to be rich.</i>

00:51.890 --> 00:53.233
<i>And it sure doesn't help
that we're living</i>

00:53.319 --> 00:55.202
<i>here in Westport, Connecticut.</i>

00:55.282 --> 00:56.394
<i>It's the kind of town</i>

00:56.419 --> 00:59.519
<i>where people have big houses
and tiny butts,</i>

01:00.409 --> 01:02.576
<i>where every idiot
has a boat and a Labradoodle.</i>

01:02.711 --> 01:03.894
<i>I'll make it easy for you.</i>

01:03.996 --> 01:05.636
<i>Here's a Labradoodle
on some idiot's boat.</i>

01:06.832 --> 01:08.832
<i>Then there's us... We're renters.</i>

01:08.918 --> 01:11.501
<i>We're here because Westport
has a great public school</i>

01:11.587 --> 01:13.837
<i>with special programs
for our Anna-Kat...</i>

01:13.923 --> 01:16.006
I'm getting great at peeing outside.

01:16.031 --> 01:17.231
Dry socks.

01:17.256 --> 01:19.389
<i>...who just might need
a little extra help.</i>

01:24.350 --> 01:26.934
<i>Anna-Kat has a touch of the anxieties.</i>

01:30.940 --> 01:32.105
<i>Not Rain Man anxiety,</i>

01:32.191 --> 01:34.524
<i>but it's not in the family newsletter.</i>

01:37.780 --> 01:38.780
Clean.

01:38.864 --> 01:40.080
<i>She's my favorite.</i>

01:40.199 --> 01:42.032
<i>That's right... I said it.</i>

01:42.117 --> 01:43.667
<i>I said it in my head.</i>

01:43.752 --> 01:45.669
You need to read my report
and check my work.

01:45.704 --> 01:46.920
Yeah. No.

01:47.039 --> 01:49.089
I was in the charge
of the Trail of Tears diorama,

01:49.174 --> 01:50.374
which I nailed.

01:50.459 --> 01:52.376
The solar system project is all Dad.

01:52.511 --> 01:53.677
Upstairs.

01:53.762 --> 01:56.713
<i>My husband Greg,
at rest in his natural habitat.</i>

01:56.799 --> 01:58.432
<i>Mommies of the world, I ask you...</i>

01:58.517 --> 02:00.017
<i>what would happen if we all took</i>

02:00.102 --> 02:02.052
<i>a leisurely half-hour dump
every morning?</i>

02:03.138 --> 02:04.054
What about the plops?

02:04.139 --> 02:05.472
I don't want to hear any plops.

02:05.557 --> 02:07.557
Easy-peasey chicken squeezie.

02:07.693 --> 02:09.226
<i>Lemon</i> squeezie.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.061
I can still hear!

02:11.146 --> 02:14.064
Now, don't come out
until you get those signed.

02:17.569 --> 02:19.069
Breakfast, Taylor.

02:19.154 --> 02:21.405
<i>This is Taylor, my oldest,</i>

02:21.540 --> 02:23.573
<i>whose life has been
one, long awkward phase</i>

02:23.659 --> 02:25.542
<i>until last Thursday when the Boob Fairy</i>

02:25.628 --> 02:26.910
<i>paid her a visit.</i>

02:27.046 --> 02:28.328
<i>I used to look like that.</i>

02:28.414 --> 02:30.414
<i>Let's see what she looks like
after three kids.</i>

02:30.549 --> 02:31.999
Morning, Mom.

02:32.084 --> 02:33.917
<i>She's growing up so fast.</i>

02:34.003 --> 02:35.936
How are you stocked for feminine things?

02:36.005 --> 02:37.070
I'm stocked.

02:37.172 --> 02:38.555
And I really don't want to hear

02:38.641 --> 02:40.841
another one of your
bled-through-my-pants" stories.

02:40.926 --> 02:42.926
Hey, my mother never talked
to me about any of this stuff.

02:43.062 --> 02:44.142
I spent half of sixth grade

02:44.179 --> 02:45.539
with a sweat sock in my underpants

02:45.564 --> 02:46.847
convinced I was dying.

02:48.484 --> 02:49.816
<i>Yeah, that's a lie.</i>

02:49.935 --> 02:51.735
<i>It happened to this
Pakistani girl I used to know</i>

02:51.820 --> 02:53.320
<i>who was raised by her grandfather.</i>

02:55.524 --> 02:57.824
Would now be a good time
to ask for a pet owl?

02:58.944 --> 03:01.028
I don't know if there's ever
a good time for that.

03:01.113 --> 03:02.913
Tell your mom thanks
for sending you in here

03:02.998 --> 03:04.781
for this quality
daddy-daughter toilet time.

03:04.867 --> 03:07.034
Okay, Daddy.

03:07.119 --> 03:08.618
Anna-Kat, close the door, honey.

03:08.704 --> 03:09.619
Close the door, baby.

03:09.705 --> 03:12.456
Anna... Ah, forget it.

03:13.926 --> 03:16.843
<i>Oh, Fat Pam, why are you abandoning me,</i>

03:16.962 --> 03:19.796
<i>my jolly, plus-sized, ham-ass neighbor?</i>

03:19.882 --> 03:21.465
Oh, God. Here comes Nude Norman.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.383
Hi!

03:23.469 --> 03:24.634
He's not naked.

03:24.770 --> 03:27.971
Yeah, well, to be fair to him,
it was only that one time.

03:28.107 --> 03:29.439
Oh!

03:30.976 --> 03:33.143
<i>For the love of all things, where was I?</i>

03:33.228 --> 03:34.311
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

03:34.396 --> 03:36.813
<i>Once Fat Pam is gone, I am going to be</i>

03:36.899 --> 03:38.910
<i>the second-fattest housewife
in Westport.</i>

03:41.334 --> 03:43.498

03:50.829 --> 03:52.496
Have a good day, sweetie.

03:52.581 --> 03:54.131
Remember how Dr. Ellie taught you

03:54.216 --> 03:55.832
to do that little secret thing
with your fingers

03:55.884 --> 03:59.136
to relax yourself?

03:59.221 --> 04:00.637
Try that today.

04:00.723 --> 04:02.422
- Okay, Mommy.
- Okay.

04:02.508 --> 04:04.007
Mwah.

04:04.093 --> 04:05.842
Bye.

04:11.683 --> 04:13.433
Oh, God help her.

04:17.606 --> 04:19.406
<i>Ugh. Westport mommies.</i>

04:19.524 --> 04:22.192
<i>Flat stomachs, tight, high asses,</i>

04:23.862 --> 04:26.113
<i>and those stupid green drinks.</i>

04:28.167 --> 04:29.032
Hi!

04:29.168 --> 04:30.700
- Mwah!
- Mwah!

04:30.786 --> 04:32.335
<i>Oh, great.</i>

04:32.421 --> 04:33.621
<i>Not only is Taylor growing up,</i>

04:33.672 --> 04:35.232
<i>but she's growing up to be one of them.</i>

04:35.290 --> 04:37.541
<i>My full-time job is to make sure</i>

04:37.626 --> 04:41.878
<i>two of my kids fit in less
and one fits in more.</i>

04:47.686 --> 04:49.219
Oh, Katie!

04:49.304 --> 04:50.887
Hi!

04:51.023 --> 04:53.440
You have something
on the back of your shirt.

04:54.777 --> 04:56.109
That's pizza.

04:56.228 --> 04:57.588
I thought it came out in the wash.

04:59.231 --> 05:01.565
How did you get a pizza stain
on the back of your shirt?

05:01.650 --> 05:02.949
Honest answer?

05:03.068 --> 05:05.285
I was either wearing it
backwards when I ate the pizza,

05:05.404 --> 05:07.287
or I'm wearing it backwards now.

05:08.707 --> 05:09.707
Yeah, now.

05:11.660 --> 05:13.243
I love you, Katie.

05:13.328 --> 05:14.661
You're so real.

05:14.746 --> 05:18.298
<i>"You're so real" is Westport Mommy Code</i>

Thanks, Suzanne.

05:24.256 --> 05:26.173
Bye.

05:30.762 --> 05:32.179
What do you say, bitches?

05:32.264 --> 05:33.346
Second breakfast?

05:33.432 --> 05:35.098
Yes.

05:35.234 --> 05:37.317
Celeste never even wanted
to carry a child.

05:37.436 --> 05:40.153
I'm the one whose genitals
took one for the team... twice.

05:40.239 --> 05:42.322
And yet, now she's fighting me

05:42.441 --> 05:44.407
for the last vial of our family sperm.

05:44.493 --> 05:47.244
Enough about me
and my bitter lesbian divorce.

05:47.329 --> 05:49.446
Well, I've got some news.

05:49.531 --> 05:51.698
Pam just put her house on the market.

05:51.817 --> 05:53.416
Fat Pam? Rich Fat Pam?

05:53.502 --> 05:54.701
She's moving to Vermont.

05:54.786 --> 05:56.419
And I'm going to be

05:56.505 --> 05:58.432
the second-fattest housewife
in Westport.

05:58.457 --> 06:00.217
- Mnh. Not possible.
- No way.

06:00.242 --> 06:02.269
Okay, there's Evelyn. The biggest.

06:02.294 --> 06:03.570
- Thank God for Evelyn.
- Yeah.

06:03.595 --> 06:05.579
Name another woman around here
fatter than me.

06:11.887 --> 06:13.888
- Oh, my God.
- Katie.

06:13.939 --> 06:15.305
The women around here are freaks.

06:15.440 --> 06:16.690
There's nothing wrong with you.

06:16.808 --> 06:17.974
You're beautiful and amazing.

06:18.060 --> 06:19.476
And they're just totally giving...

06:19.561 --> 06:21.561
What the hell is that woman
over there wearing?

06:21.647 --> 06:22.562
Is that a Fitbit?

06:22.648 --> 06:23.897
Uh, yeah. That's a Fitbit.

06:23.982 --> 06:24.981
But she's wearing two of them.

06:25.067 --> 06:27.484
Yeah, she is. One on each wrist.

06:27.619 --> 06:29.819
I literally cannot conceive of a reason

06:29.905 --> 06:31.988
why a person would need
to wear two Fitbits.

06:32.074 --> 06:34.708
When did it become okay
for women our age

06:34.826 --> 06:36.826
to do nothing but diet and work out?

06:36.962 --> 06:38.995
It's all those damn fools do.

06:39.131 --> 06:40.163
It's completely absurd

06:40.299 --> 06:42.215
and a total waste of feminine energy.

06:42.334 --> 06:44.918
I object to it deeply
and on every level.

06:45.003 --> 06:46.419
On every level.

06:46.505 --> 06:48.305
Do you know what you are, Katie?

06:48.390 --> 06:49.756
- You're a revolutionary.
- Mm-hmm.

06:49.841 --> 06:51.925
Half the women in this country
are over a size 14,

06:52.010 --> 06:53.510
and they're made to feel bad
about themselves.

06:53.645 --> 06:55.095
Who came up with the idea
that a mother of three

06:55.180 --> 06:56.573
should have an ass like a 19-year-old?

06:56.598 --> 06:59.326
Oh, you have a great ass, Katie.

06:59.351 --> 07:02.185
Like a couple of ripe
cantaloupes in your pants.

07:02.321 --> 07:04.321
Thank you. I know.

07:04.406 --> 07:05.446
I'll tell you one thing...

07:05.524 --> 07:06.940
I'm not going on some stupid diet.

07:07.025 --> 07:09.409
Greg pretty much wants to have
sex with me all the time anyway.

07:09.528 --> 07:10.528
I'm not really interested

07:10.662 --> 07:12.195
in giving him any added incentives.

07:12.331 --> 07:14.581
Sex on a full stomach after midnight

07:14.700 --> 07:15.700
against my will?

07:15.784 --> 07:16.833
Uh-huh.

07:16.919 --> 07:19.202
You have to sit next to me
while I watch "Castle"

07:19.288 --> 07:20.921
and let me talk
about Nathan Fillion's hair.

07:21.006 --> 07:23.039
I told you that makes me feel
self-conscious.

07:23.175 --> 07:24.207
His hair is so lustrous.

07:24.343 --> 07:25.592
Oh, we're talking two full episodes

07:25.711 --> 07:27.210
if I don't make you wear
the sleeping mask.

07:27.346 --> 07:28.712
You know I love the way you look.

07:28.797 --> 07:31.047
I ate something weird.

07:31.133 --> 07:33.049
Mmm.

07:33.185 --> 07:35.268
You... You feel different.

07:35.387 --> 07:37.771
Mm. Different how?

07:37.889 --> 07:39.389
Like a, uh...

07:39.558 --> 07:42.275
brand-new bag of flour.

07:43.729 --> 07:45.528
It's my Spanx.

07:45.614 --> 07:47.397
Oh, let's just get those
off of you, then.

07:47.482 --> 07:50.066
That's not gonna work.
They're hooked to my bra.

07:50.168 --> 07:51.234
Why?

07:51.320 --> 07:53.386
Well, if you do it right,
it turns gut into boob.

07:53.488 --> 07:55.405
- Well, they do look good.
- Well, they should.

07:55.540 --> 07:57.574
They're 1/3 gut.

08:02.047 --> 08:03.496
I feel good.

08:03.582 --> 08:04.831
Me, too.

08:04.916 --> 08:08.068
I always feel a tiny bit sick,
but not in a bad way.

08:08.170 --> 08:09.252
Is your top on backwards?

08:09.388 --> 08:11.404
Yeah.

08:15.260 --> 08:17.060
Taylor, tell your brother
how well you did

08:17.145 --> 08:18.345
with the food drive last year.

08:18.463 --> 08:20.347
I did very well.

08:20.432 --> 08:22.015
I don't believe in giving hand-outs.

08:22.100 --> 08:23.817
This constant doling out of freebies

08:23.935 --> 08:24.935
violates my principles,

08:25.070 --> 08:26.770
and it's tearing this country apart.

08:26.855 --> 08:29.272
I don't like it, Mom.
I don't like it one bit.

08:29.358 --> 08:30.523
They told me to stop

08:30.609 --> 08:32.859
eating soft cheeses
while I was pregnant with you,

08:32.961 --> 08:34.744
but I didn't listen.

08:34.830 --> 08:36.279
And this is what happens.

08:37.566 --> 08:39.948
I think that's a weird thing
to say to a child.

08:40.034 --> 08:41.784
Listen to me, Oliver.

08:41.870 --> 08:44.297
Bring in some damn cans of food
for the food drive tomorrow,

08:44.352 --> 08:46.506
and that is a direct order.

08:46.625 --> 08:47.891
Okay, fine.

08:47.953 --> 08:50.794
But shouldn't you be focusing
on your kids who needs focusing?

08:50.879 --> 08:52.278
How's school, Anna-Kat?

08:52.381 --> 08:54.464
Well, I don't have any friends.

08:54.549 --> 08:57.133
Of course you have friends, sweetie.

08:57.219 --> 08:59.302
Today it was because I wouldn't
hold hands in partner tag.

08:59.388 --> 09:00.887
Why didn't you hold hands
in partner tag?

09:01.006 --> 09:03.306
Because I don't want to catch
people's invisible germs.

09:03.392 --> 09:04.891
What? What are you talking about?

09:04.976 --> 09:06.309
That's how you get sick.

09:06.445 --> 09:08.862
- That is not how you get sick.
- Pretty sure it is.

09:10.065 --> 09:11.781
Right.

09:11.867 --> 09:12.899
Germs are made up.

09:14.369 --> 09:16.319
Everyone's crazy.

09:17.254 --> 09:18.621
So...

09:18.707 --> 09:20.156
I came up with a few ways

09:20.242 --> 09:22.158
to stop Fat Pam from leaving town.

09:22.244 --> 09:24.994
If she can't sell her house,
she can't move, right?

09:25.080 --> 09:26.162
Oh, this can't miss.

09:26.248 --> 09:28.715
Number 1... remove three tires from car

09:28.834 --> 09:30.333
- and park on lawn.
- Next.

09:30.469 --> 09:31.968
Take in Urban Youth

09:32.054 --> 09:34.921
or people who just seem terrorist-y.

09:35.057 --> 09:36.172
No.

09:36.258 --> 09:37.658
We become "The end is near" people.

09:37.726 --> 09:39.206
You know those people, "End is near!"

09:39.261 --> 09:40.343
I'm not gonna do that.

09:40.479 --> 09:43.346
Two words... tampon wind chime.

09:45.917 --> 09:47.350
Okay.

09:47.486 --> 09:48.518
Put two hogs in yard.

09:48.653 --> 09:50.019
Did you actually write that
on the paper?

09:50.155 --> 09:51.521
Mm-hmm. And I put a star next to it.

09:51.573 --> 09:53.022
Greg.

09:53.158 --> 09:56.025
I know you think that I'm acting crazy,

09:56.111 --> 09:57.744
but there's Evelyn, there's Pam,

09:57.863 --> 09:58.778
and then there's me.

09:58.864 --> 10:02.115
With Pam gone, I move up a notch.

10:02.200 --> 10:05.785
And it's like stepping
into a really bright spotlight.

10:05.871 --> 10:08.004
And it's making me feel
really bad about something

10:08.090 --> 10:10.540
that I don't already feel great
about in the first place...

10:10.675 --> 10:11.975
being fat.

10:12.043 --> 10:13.560
Oh, sweetie.

10:14.546 --> 10:15.962
This is the part
where you say I'm not fat.

10:16.047 --> 10:17.714
You're not fat.

10:17.816 --> 10:19.656
Instead of trying to scare away
all the buyers,

10:19.718 --> 10:24.437
wouldn't it be easier to find
a larger-ish-type gal

10:24.556 --> 10:26.072
to buy the house instead?

10:26.141 --> 10:27.857
<i>And there it was.</i>

10:27.943 --> 10:29.683
<i>It was right in front of me
the whole time.</i>

10:29.708 --> 10:30.664
<i>If it was O.J.,</i>

10:30.689 --> 10:32.676
<i>it would have murdered me
in front of my own dog.</i>

10:32.841 --> 10:35.198
<i>I need to find myself a ripe fatty</i>

10:35.300 --> 10:37.767
<i>and get her into Fat Pam's house,</i>

10:37.869 --> 10:39.335
<i>and fast.</i>

10:45.956 --> 10:47.589
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:48.616 --> 10:50.616
So, we're looking
for the right kind of buyer...

10:50.701 --> 10:52.201
someone bigger than me.

10:52.286 --> 10:53.919
Any skinnies who seem interested,

10:54.038 --> 10:55.038
scare 'em off.

10:55.122 --> 10:57.423
Is it too late for tampon wind chimes?

10:57.541 --> 10:58.707
You had your chance.

11:01.796 --> 11:03.679
I mean, it's probably just a coincidence

11:03.764 --> 11:05.347
that the whole family got cancer.

11:05.433 --> 11:06.632
Right?

11:09.036 --> 11:11.887
I come into this house
to see my dead friends.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.355
Whoops.

11:14.809 --> 11:16.845
We often wonder why an
arsonist would be so obsessed

11:16.870 --> 11:18.236
with our little neighborhood.

11:26.777 --> 11:28.473
Oh, my God. It's Two Fitbits.

11:28.498 --> 11:29.498
Who?

11:29.523 --> 11:33.242
That woman over there
wearing two Fitbits.

11:33.377 --> 11:35.017
Why would anyone need
to wear two Fitbits?

11:35.045 --> 11:36.712
I know!

11:36.797 --> 11:39.214
This is why I tolerate
the look of your feet!

11:39.300 --> 11:41.327
Well, just go over there and
convince her not to buy this house.

11:41.352 --> 11:42.645
It's no use.

11:42.670 --> 11:43.802
There hasn't been

11:43.827 --> 11:45.844
a single tubby person
in this place all afternoon.

11:45.938 --> 11:47.588
I might as well accept it...

11:47.673 --> 11:49.473
I'm going to be Vice Fattest.

11:50.559 --> 11:52.593
We should go.

11:54.000 --> 12:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:12.481 --> 12:15.732
Why, hello there.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.609
She seemed to really love that house.

12:21.727 --> 12:23.193
And she's bigger than me, right?

12:23.280 --> 12:24.945
Yeah, there's no getting
around her on the sidewalk.

12:25.013 --> 12:26.096
Anna-Kat, honey,

12:26.121 --> 12:28.405
you know we're super proud
of you, right?

12:28.430 --> 12:30.813
For doing what,
holding hands during germ tag?

12:30.899 --> 12:32.565
Yes. No.

12:32.590 --> 12:33.789
Not germ tag.

12:33.814 --> 12:36.819
We're proud of you
for trying something new.

12:36.860 --> 12:38.293
Thanks, Mommy.

12:40.308 --> 12:42.442
Is that one of those
green healthy drinks?

12:42.561 --> 12:43.561
Yeah.

12:43.645 --> 12:46.062
I will not have that in this house.

12:47.315 --> 12:49.899
Dad, I'll leave you to handle this.

12:49.985 --> 12:51.305
Could I talk to you for a minute?

12:51.369 --> 12:52.369
- Okay.
- Yeah, please.

12:52.404 --> 12:54.537
- All right.
- Okay.

12:54.656 --> 12:55.738
So, you're acting crazy.

12:55.824 --> 12:57.384
You know who drinks those green drinks?

12:57.459 --> 12:58.979
All those horrible women in this town.

12:59.044 --> 13:01.661
I will not have my daughter
become one of them...

13:01.746 --> 13:04.230
40-year-olds who are trying
to look like teenagers.

13:04.332 --> 13:06.249
But Taylor <i> is</i> a teenager.

13:06.334 --> 13:07.694
I will not have my teenage daughter

13:07.752 --> 13:09.719
acting like a 40-year-old
trying to act like a teenager.

13:09.754 --> 13:10.754
Mnh-mnh.

13:10.839 --> 13:12.922
Okay, I'm just gonna
relocate these, okay?

13:14.843 --> 13:17.427
You know we have a step stool.

13:17.512 --> 13:18.552
Yeah.

13:18.597 --> 13:19.846
Huh.

13:19.931 --> 13:21.731
Oliver's teacher just e-mailed.

13:21.816 --> 13:23.821
Apparently, today,
he brought in a single can

13:23.846 --> 13:25.963
of expired cat food for the poor.

13:26.821 --> 13:27.937
How do you think we should handle...

13:28.023 --> 13:29.272
Oliver!

13:29.357 --> 13:31.357
Hey, Mom.

13:31.443 --> 13:32.742
Hey, that's my money!

13:32.827 --> 13:34.777
You just lost it all, my friend.

13:34.913 --> 13:37.447
I am giving it
to a charity of my choosing.

13:37.582 --> 13:39.782
Mom! That's for my Roth IRA!

13:39.868 --> 13:41.167
Your wha...

13:41.252 --> 13:42.752
I will not have you be one of these

13:42.837 --> 13:44.287
money-obsessed brats in this town.

13:44.372 --> 13:46.673
You are not getting this back
until you do something good

13:46.791 --> 13:48.174
for someone other than yourself.

13:48.259 --> 13:50.126
I worked hard to save that money.

13:50.211 --> 13:51.928
This is straight-up communism.

13:52.013 --> 13:52.912
You're right.

13:53.014 --> 13:54.380
It is communism, and I'm...

13:54.466 --> 13:55.965
Who was worse, Lenin or Stalin?

13:56.051 --> 13:58.718
Pretty sure Stalin killed
the most people.

13:58.803 --> 13:59.969
I'm Stalin.

14:05.977 --> 14:08.027
I think I'm sick, Mama.

14:09.364 --> 14:11.284
You know how lots of times
you think you're sick,

14:11.316 --> 14:12.396
but you're not really sick?

14:12.450 --> 14:13.566
Mm-hmm.

14:13.652 --> 14:15.985
Do you think maybe this
is one of those times?

14:21.923 --> 14:24.994
She says she never wants to
touch anyone's hand ever again.

14:25.080 --> 14:27.163
She thinks she got sick
from partner tag.

14:27.248 --> 14:29.332
Where would she get such a crazy idea?

14:29.417 --> 14:32.001
A science textbook? A doctor?

14:32.087 --> 14:33.087
I knew it.

14:33.138 --> 14:34.138
What?

14:34.172 --> 14:35.338
She gets this from you.

14:35.473 --> 14:37.674
I'm straight-up mentally healthy
in the germ department.

14:37.759 --> 14:39.439
Remember that time
that cat licked your leg

14:39.477 --> 14:40.360
and you actually screamed?

14:40.512 --> 14:41.761
It had very red lips.

14:41.846 --> 14:42.762
Okay.

14:42.847 --> 14:43.930
Well, this is your mess.

14:44.015 --> 14:45.398
And unless you want our daughter

14:45.500 --> 14:47.150
to never touch another human ever again,

14:47.235 --> 14:48.675
you need to get in there and fix it.

14:52.774 --> 14:53.856
Hi.

14:53.942 --> 14:55.858
Okay. Here it is in a nutshell.

14:55.944 --> 14:58.194
Friends are more important than germs.

14:59.214 --> 15:01.831
- What do you mean, "in a nutshell"?
- Forget I said "nutshell."

15:01.916 --> 15:04.033
Friends are more important than germs.

15:04.119 --> 15:06.903
Friends are more important than germs?

15:07.005 --> 15:08.204
That's right.

15:08.306 --> 15:10.373
And someday, you're gonna have
a gazillion friends

15:10.508 --> 15:12.425
'cause you are what we call an original.

15:12.527 --> 15:14.127
Just remember to always wash your hands.

15:14.212 --> 15:15.412
And never pee at a state fair.

15:15.463 --> 15:16.463
Greg!

15:16.564 --> 15:18.084
Friends are more important than germs.

15:20.351 --> 15:21.551
Thanks, Daddy.

15:24.806 --> 15:27.273
Hey!

15:29.194 --> 15:30.226
You convinced me.

15:30.361 --> 15:33.229
We've put in our offer
well above the asking price.

15:33.314 --> 15:34.314
I had to outbid

15:34.399 --> 15:35.698
some chicken-legged lady in yoga pants.

15:35.784 --> 15:36.816
I love you!

15:36.901 --> 15:39.485
You have no idea how happy I am!

15:41.122 --> 15:43.156
I am so glad you talked us
into Westport.

15:43.241 --> 15:45.491
I had to. I couldn't let you go.

15:45.543 --> 15:47.960
Well, we were a little hesitant
to move here, to be honest.

15:49.086 --> 15:51.466
- Because of all the rich blacks.
- What's that, now?

15:51.549 --> 15:53.029
There are a lot of them, right?

15:53.107 --> 15:55.752
And gays "raising kids" together?

15:55.837 --> 15:57.920
I guess we just do our best
to avoid them.

15:58.006 --> 15:59.756
Mm.

15:59.841 --> 16:01.674
See you around!

16:01.760 --> 16:03.426
<i>Was I really willing to let this happen,</i>

16:03.545 --> 16:06.095
<i>to welcome this racist
homophobe to the neighborhood</i>

16:06.231 --> 16:07.396
<i>just so I could feel better</i>

16:07.482 --> 16:09.265
<i>about myself and my well-nourished body?</i>

16:09.400 --> 16:10.767
<i>Could I do such a thing</i>

16:10.902 --> 16:12.068
<i>just to keep from becoming</i>

16:12.153 --> 16:13.853
<i>the second-fattest housewife
in Westport?</i>

16:13.938 --> 16:14.987
Gail!

16:16.407 --> 16:18.107
Welcome to Westport!

16:20.028 --> 16:23.279
<i>Apparently, I could.</i>

16:23.994 --> 16:27.182
_

16:37.889 --> 16:40.420
- Madame.
- Norman!

16:40.490 --> 16:44.075
Honey, look who's at the door!

16:44.160 --> 16:45.910
I like your sweater.

16:45.995 --> 16:46.995
Oh.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.680
Do you know when you'll be done with it?

16:49.582 --> 16:50.582
Hey, Norman.

16:50.666 --> 16:51.916
Hi.

16:52.001 --> 16:53.384
Hello, little lady.

16:53.469 --> 16:55.686
Friends are more important than germs.

16:55.788 --> 16:57.304
Would you like to be my friend?

16:59.175 --> 17:01.425
I would be honored to be your friend.

17:01.511 --> 17:03.444
I have a friend!

17:03.563 --> 17:05.012
That's wonderful.

17:05.114 --> 17:07.098
Hey. Hey. Come on. Come on.

17:07.233 --> 17:08.898
Come on, sweetie.

17:08.984 --> 17:10.267
Let's go wash that hand.

17:10.353 --> 17:12.319
Sorry for the intrusion.

17:12.438 --> 17:14.905
Oliver said I could find him here.

17:14.991 --> 17:16.941
Uh, it's okay, Mom. I've got this.

17:17.076 --> 17:17.942
Hi, Norm.

17:18.077 --> 17:19.292
Oh, no.

17:19.444 --> 17:21.078
I'm not going anywhere.

17:21.180 --> 17:22.195
Okay.

17:22.298 --> 17:23.446
I finished the yardwork.

17:23.532 --> 17:25.616
No breaks except for
a couple bathroom emergencies

17:25.701 --> 17:27.701
and double-time,
just like you suggested.

17:27.787 --> 17:30.621
The Wilsons and the Gordons
want me back next week!

17:30.706 --> 17:32.123
We're in business!

17:32.258 --> 17:34.008
Here's your cut.

17:36.045 --> 17:37.344
Bye.

17:39.432 --> 17:41.632
I told you to do something good
for someone else.

17:41.717 --> 17:43.968
I did something <i> great</i> for someone else.

17:44.103 --> 17:45.352
I taught a man to fish.

17:45.471 --> 17:47.138
Did you see the light in his eyes?

17:47.223 --> 17:49.473
You took money from a homeless person.

17:49.559 --> 17:51.308
Hey, I lined up the jobs for him,

17:51.444 --> 17:53.227
so I got something for my trouble.

17:53.312 --> 17:54.895
It's a little thing called capitalism.

17:54.981 --> 17:55.981
Seriously, Oliver?

17:56.115 --> 17:58.105
You are acting like a pimp
in a Lifetime movie.

17:58.190 --> 17:59.654
I don't know what to do
with you anymore.

17:59.753 --> 18:01.151
How about nothing?

18:01.273 --> 18:03.033
If I thought I might
be a girl on the inside,

18:03.098 --> 18:04.636
you'd let me wear a skirt to school.

18:04.714 --> 18:05.771
This is no different.

18:05.870 --> 18:07.458
I should be allowed to be who I am.

18:08.325 --> 18:09.994
No.

18:10.079 --> 18:11.495
Well, you're not being who you are.

18:11.631 --> 18:12.631
Excuse me?

18:12.665 --> 18:14.065
Anna-Kat told me about scaring away

18:14.167 --> 18:15.916
the thin ladies at the open house.

18:16.002 --> 18:18.169
Very poor example you're setting, Mom.

18:18.304 --> 18:19.753
<i>Damn it. He's right.</i>

18:19.839 --> 18:22.022
<i>When did I start caring
about what other people think?</i>

18:22.141 --> 18:24.859
<i>I practically invented
food shopping in pajamas.</i>

18:24.927 --> 18:27.678
<i>I'm not gonna let this town
change me or my kid.</i>

18:27.763 --> 18:30.524
You are going to donate 20%
of that money to the Food Bank.

18:30.628 --> 18:32.850
- 5%.
- 15%.

18:32.935 --> 18:34.698
- 6%.
- 80%.

18:35.071 --> 18:36.320
10%?

18:37.523 --> 18:38.772
Deal.

18:41.277 --> 18:42.943
<i>I need to fix the mess I made next door</i>

18:43.029 --> 18:44.695
<i>no matter what it takes.</i>

18:44.780 --> 18:46.697
<i>But how do you get a racist homophobe</i>

18:46.782 --> 18:48.699
<i>to fall out of escrow?</i>

18:48.784 --> 18:50.034
Hi, Gail.

18:50.119 --> 18:51.368
Hi, neighbor.

18:51.504 --> 18:54.588
I would like for you to meet
Angela, my wife and lover.

18:54.707 --> 18:56.490
I've heard so much about you.

19:02.798 --> 19:03.918
Welcome to the neighborhood.

19:07.303 --> 19:10.221
Mom! Front door for you!

19:10.356 --> 19:13.941
<i>Mother of balls, it's Two Fitbits.</i>

19:15.194 --> 19:17.861
Mom, this is our new neighbor, Viv.

19:17.947 --> 19:18.947
Oh, I love your earrings.

19:19.031 --> 19:20.064
Oh, thanks.

19:20.149 --> 19:22.316
- Mom, don't you like them?
- No, I don't.

19:22.401 --> 19:24.568
So, you bought
the house across the street.

19:24.704 --> 19:27.821
Turns out the first buyer got cold feet.

19:27.907 --> 19:28.907
Hmm.

19:30.076 --> 19:32.910
Your house is so cozy.

19:32.995 --> 19:33.995
Thank you.

19:34.046 --> 19:35.796
Adorable, really.

19:35.821 --> 19:36.903
Yeah, I know.

19:36.928 --> 19:38.249
- It is.
- Thank you.

19:38.334 --> 19:41.669
And I'm gonna love
getting my hands on you.

19:41.754 --> 19:43.137
Excuse me?

19:43.222 --> 19:44.605
I used to be a big girl.

19:44.724 --> 19:46.590
- I can totally help you.
- Mm.

19:46.676 --> 19:49.059
We can go walk-jogging together.

19:49.145 --> 19:50.811
You walk and then you run

19:50.930 --> 19:52.479
and then you walk and then you run.

19:52.598 --> 19:54.431
And then you just run.

19:54.567 --> 19:57.217
Yeah, not one part of that
is going to happen.

19:57.320 --> 19:58.602
I love it.

19:58.738 --> 20:00.020
I love you.

20:00.106 --> 20:01.589
You're so real.

20:01.691 --> 20:02.990
<i>And there it was again...</i>

20:03.092 --> 20:05.826
<i>the damning Westport "You're so real."</i>

20:05.945 --> 20:07.861
Oh, you're like a little cherub.

20:07.947 --> 20:09.830
Okay. Mm-hmm.

20:09.949 --> 20:11.415
Oh!

20:11.500 --> 20:13.117
Ooh!

20:13.202 --> 20:15.452
Hey!

20:15.588 --> 20:18.622
I'm gonna buy you a Fitbit.

20:20.509 --> 20:23.294
<i>And the truth is, Two Fitbits was right.</i>

20:23.379 --> 20:26.263
<i>I am real,
and I need to keep my kids real</i>

20:26.349 --> 20:28.632
<i>if I'm going to raise them in this town.</i>

20:28.718 --> 20:32.686
<i>I'm not giving up like Fat Pam,
so watch out, skinnies.</i>

20:34.190 --> 20:35.356
<i>I'm officially</i>

20:35.474 --> 20:37.074
<i>the second-fattest housewife
in Westport.</i>

20:37.143 --> 20:39.643
<i>I'm not thrilled about it,
but I'm owning it.</i>

20:39.729 --> 20:41.278
<i>Oh, and also...</i>

20:41.364 --> 20:42.696
I'm eating this.

20:45.805 --> 20:46.888
So, all I have to do

20:46.988 --> 20:48.781
is keep Taylor in bulky sweaters
for a few years

20:48.856 --> 20:50.577
and then try to slap
some sense into Oliver.

20:50.610 --> 20:52.043
You look good.

20:52.886 --> 20:53.928
Mnh-mnh.

20:54.230 --> 20:55.246
All right.

20:55.315 --> 20:56.315
I was talking

20:56.366 --> 20:57.815
about the challenges with our children.

20:57.901 --> 20:59.400
Our kids are fine.

21:05.909 --> 21:07.758
You were saying?

21:07.827 --> 21:10.645
What? You never wanted to take
everything red out of your room?
