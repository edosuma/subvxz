No, you're a Class "A" grinder...

11:52.445 --> 11:55.642
meaning thatyou grind your teeth
so fervently that you need braces.

11:55.748 --> 11:57.909
Braces?
You've got to be kidding!

11:58.017 --> 12:00.008
[ Chuckles ]
I onlywish, Mr. Smith.

12:00.119 --> 12:03.247
And I onlywish I had never known
the sickly sweet scent of my father's love...

12:03.355 --> 12:05.255
with that filthy fat gypsy.

12:05.357 --> 12:07.848
And that I could have mustered
something other than "Papa, no!"...

12:07.960 --> 12:10.394
before that shrieking monkey
drove me from the room.

12:10.496 --> 12:12.964
But you're a grinder,
and you're getting braces.

12:13.065 --> 12:15.465
But I-I already had braces
when I was a kid.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.559
Doctor, I've paid my dues.

12:17.670 --> 12:21.436
- [ Thinking ] Papa, no!
- [ Thinking: Monkey Screeching ]

12:21.540 --> 12:23.440
- [ Thinking: Footsteps Running ]
- [ Thinking: Door Slamming Shut ]

12:23.542 --> 12:26.978
Do we ever pay our dues,
Mr. Smith?

12:29.982 --> 12:31.950
[ Beeps ]

12:32.051 --> 12:34.747
[ Beeping Rapidly]

12:37.423 --> 12:39.857
This morning
the cyber-terrorist struck again.

12:39.959 --> 12:42.325
Agent Smith, could you
tell us the location?

12:42.428 --> 12:44.794
[ Lisping ]
The Securities and Exchange Commission.

12:44.897 --> 12:48.594
- [ All Laughing ]
- Oh, ha, ha, veryfunny.

12:48.701 --> 12:51.932
All right. All right. Settle down.
Back to the cyber-terrorist.

12:52.037 --> 12:55.598
Once again, he sent a note
in the same mysterious language.

12:55.708 --> 12:58.541
All of our living code breakers
are absolutely stumped.

12:58.644 --> 13:03.172
Therefore, because we have no leads,
this afternoon we'll be raiding a mosque.

13:03.282 --> 13:06.046
- [ All Cheering ]
- All right! Yeah! Yeah!

13:07.153 --> 13:09.053
Hey, pizza face!
Here comes a delivery!

13:09.155 --> 13:11.851
[ All Laughing ]

13:11.957 --> 13:13.857
Well, that guywas a real jerk.

13:13.959 --> 13:18.020
Yes. It's a sad sightwhen Americans
turn against Americans.

13:24.069 --> 13:27.436
- [Men Laughing]
- Oh, ha, ha. Real mature, guys.

13:27.540 --> 13:30.475
- You're lucky I'm wearing myvest.
- Your attention, please.

13:30.576 --> 13:34.876
I'm afraid the arbitrary raid on that mosque
has been canceled due to rain.

13:36.115 --> 13:38.640
- [ All Aahing ]
- Man!

13:38.751 --> 13:42.551
Well, I might as well get my rainy-day
mix tape out ofthe car.

13:43.756 --> 13:45.656
Wait a second.

13:45.758 --> 13:48.556
Not a drop of rain
in all ofChristendom.

13:50.996 --> 13:53.328
- They ditched me.
- [Horn Honking]

13:53.432 --> 13:55.866
[ Honking Continues ]

13:55.968 --> 13:58.994
[ All Laughing ]

13:59.104 --> 14:01.800
I'm telling the president on you!

14:05.744 --> 14:10.772
They all went on a mission and left me
behind like- like I was... a geek!

14:10.883 --> 14:13.249
Well, nowyou know
howyou made Steve feel.

14:13.352 --> 14:18.085
Soyou need to go to him and apologize
and tell him how much you love him.

14:18.190 --> 14:21.785
Fine. IfI'm gonna be a geek,
I might as well be a sissytoo.

14:23.462 --> 14:27.398
I steal your bag ofholding, cut off
your head with myvorpal blade...

14:27.499 --> 14:30.400
and throwyour corpse in
the fires of Lake Piracima!

14:30.502 --> 14:34.962
- Whoa! Easy, Steve.
- I am notyour father, okay?

14:35.074 --> 14:40.376
I'm just Balthor, a simple ogre blacksmith
trying to make a living.

14:40.479 --> 14:42.606
[ SpeakingJapanese ]

14:45.751 --> 14:48.948
Steve, may I speak toyou
for a second?

14:50.155 --> 14:53.124
Come on, Steve.
He's your dad.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.318
Shut up, fatty fat, fat pants!

14:55.427 --> 14:57.918
Wow. Seriously,
I have no idea what that's about.

14:58.030 --> 15:00.521
Only the holder of
the amulet may talk.

15:00.633 --> 15:04.262
- So I give you an elf curse!
- Oh, my God!

15:04.370 --> 15:07.339
[Stan ] That's the language
the cyber-terrorist uses in his notes!

15:07.439 --> 15:09.907
What? Wait.
May I?

15:10.009 --> 15:12.569
Why do they always set
the rear brackets too tight?

15:12.678 --> 15:15.613
- There. Now say something.
- [ Lisp Free ] Sweet Sally Struthers.

15:15.714 --> 15:18.740
Sweet Sally Struthers.
I can say sweet Sally Struthers!

15:18.851 --> 15:21.012
- Now tell me, what is that language?
- It's Elvish.

15:21.120 --> 15:26.023
- Of course. The Yiddish Elvis.
- No. The language ofthe elves.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.457
Look, Steve, ifyou could
translate his notes...

15:28.560 --> 15:31.654
then I could capture this madman
and be one ofthe cool agents again.

15:31.764 --> 15:35.029
Please, Son.
I really need your help.

15:35.134 --> 15:37.967
[ Sighs ]
Fine. I'll helpyou.

15:39.838 --> 15:44.639
Look, Mr. Smith,
your stress zits are going away. Yea!

15:44.743 --> 15:46.802
Oh, God,
I want to hityou!

15:49.248 --> 15:52.012
Okay, in this one,
the cyber-terrorist says...

15:52.117 --> 15:56.645
"Your moneywill come to a grinding halt
and all because of society's fault."

15:56.755 --> 16:01.283
Of course! He was taunting us about his
attack on the Securities Exchange Commission.

16:01.393 --> 16:05.762
If only there was some clue as to
who this elusive mastermind is.

16:05.864 --> 16:08.992
It's right here in the letterhead-
"From the desk of Dan Vebber."

16:09.101 --> 16:12.559
- Holy crap! The Dan Vebber?
- You know this monster?

16:12.671 --> 16:18.371
Areyou kidding? He's only the contributing
editor of Wizards andShut-Ins magazine.

16:18.477 --> 16:22.846
And tonight, there's only one place
he could be- the sci-fi convention.

16:22.948 --> 16:27.715
Then let's go! And way to save precious seconds
by abbreviating science fiction as sci-fi.

16:27.820 --> 16:32.484
But next time, maybe say sci-fi con or S.F.C.,
because time is ofthe essence.

16:32.591 --> 16:35.685
Or as we say at the agency,
T.O.- No. No, wait.

16:35.794 --> 16:41.596
Time is- is of- T.I.O.- T.I.O.-
What am I spelling here?

16:43.335 --> 16:45.895
- Where are you going?
- Sci-fi convention!

16:47.473 --> 16:50.203
Roger, I know a place where
you can meet people. [ Gasps ]

16:51.543 --> 16:54.103
Oh, my God!
Ifhe had just held on!

16:54.213 --> 16:57.307
Huh? Oh, no, no. I sleep like this sometimes.
It's good for my back.

16:57.416 --> 16:59.384
So where are we going?

17:01.520 --> 17:04.421
So whywould Dan Vebber
become a cyber-terrorist?

17:04.522 --> 17:06.548
What do we know about Dan Vebber?

17:06.657 --> 17:10.185
- Well, he's a grown man obsessed
with The Lordofthe Rings-
- That's it!

17:10.295 --> 17:12.229
By destroying modern infrastructures...

17:12.330 --> 17:15.266
he hopes to create a Middle Earth
in the here and now.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.267
That's it!
I've cracked it!

17:17.368 --> 17:19.894
But wait a second.

- I'm Agent Scully.
- Excellent. Follow me.

17:43.562 --> 17:46.292
I don't know who he's playing,
but he is so committed.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.389
Do not invite him
back to the apartment.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.400
- But-
- Not even to watch.

17:50.502 --> 17:53.699
Oh, this is so great,
not having to wear a disguise.

17:53.806 --> 17:56.673
I can actually make a connection
with people as me.

- Right. Right, Kurt.

- How am I doing? You probed me!

knows that Luke Skywalker...

18:49.061 --> 18:51.552
would totally destroy Frodo!

Yes. Were it not for the one ring
which bestows the power of invisibility.

18:56.735 --> 18:59.397
- That's Dan Vebber!
- Sorry, Vebber.

you want to connect with people...
