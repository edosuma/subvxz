Alright, uh, please,
put me down.

01:54.247 --> 01:58.519
Am I to assume from this little
display that my team won?

01:58.552 --> 02:00.721
Mr. Twinkacetti,
you should've been there.

02:00.754 --> 02:04.390
Slugger hit four home runs
and then Jennifer walked

02:04.424 --> 02:05.926
and then Mary Ann
struck out.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.728
Too bad, Mary Ann.
And then‐‐

02:07.761 --> 02:09.329
Now, turnip, turnip!

02:09.362 --> 02:10.597
If I wanna hear
the play by play

02:10.631 --> 02:14.167
I'll ask the manager,
not the water boy.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.301
Well, he's not
just the water boy

02:15.335 --> 02:16.570
he's also the scorekeeper

02:16.603 --> 02:17.571
and the head cheerleader.

02:17.604 --> 02:19.339
He‐he.
Who cares?

02:19.372 --> 02:20.707
Did we beat the spread?

02:20.741 --> 02:23.476
We creamed the Hoot Owls
ten to four.

02:23.510 --> 02:24.945
(all cheering)
Yay!

02:24.978 --> 02:26.513
Oh, by the way,
uh, those uniforms

02:26.547 --> 02:28.682
I paid for to
advertise the store

02:28.715 --> 02:31.585
I noticed some of you got
a little dirt on the logo.

02:31.618 --> 02:32.886
Do it again
and you're off the team.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.959
Thank you for the encouragement,
Mr. Twinkacetti. Yeah.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.360
Uh, ye‐yeah,
before you go

02:40.393 --> 02:42.495
I'd just like to say
a few words.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.366
As you know,
if we can beat

02:46.399 --> 02:49.970
the Shop 'N Spend Spartans
next Saturday's game

02:50.003 --> 02:52.305

02:52.338 --> 02:53.507
(all cheering)
Yay!

02:53.540 --> 02:55.642
And since I'm the manager

02:55.676 --> 02:57.410
the champion's trophy
will be mine.

02:59.746 --> 03:03.817
But I will share it
with each and every one of you..

03:03.850 --> 03:04.885
...in spirit.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.452

03:19.866 --> 03:21.768
I'm surprised Slugger left
right after the game.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.504
He usually likes to
get a little pat on the butt

03:23.537 --> 03:25.706
from me after he's
had a great game.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.473
Well, I guess it can
wait till next week.

03:28.509 --> 03:29.710
Oh, I almost forgot.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.244
Slugger's going
to the Grand Canyon

03:31.277 --> 03:32.245
with his family.

03:32.278 --> 03:33.079
‐ Oh..
‐ Yeah.

03:33.113 --> 03:34.480
He won't be at
the game next Saturday.

03:34.515 --> 03:35.582
Mm‐hmm.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.819
Why didn't he tell me?

03:38.852 --> 03:42.523
Well, maybe he was afraid
that you would do this to him.

03:45.792 --> 03:47.427
And he's got chest hair.

03:50.597 --> 03:52.733
Come to think of it,
so do I.

04:02.809 --> 04:05.979
The Spartans
are gonna bury us.

04:06.012 --> 04:08.414
Goodbye, trophy!

04:08.448 --> 04:10.951
Without Slugger, we stink.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.687
Cousin, Slugger is just
one person and you always said

04:13.720 --> 04:15.556
"Everybody on
the team is equal."

04:16.656 --> 04:18.992
Well, equal in
the sense that, uh

04:19.024 --> 04:21.595
that I, uh, lied.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.733
But then you just have
to find another good player.

04:26.767 --> 04:27.601
Uh, where?

04:27.634 --> 04:30.070
Players like Slugger
don't grow on trees.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.573
Maybe you‐you find
him right here.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.608
Oh sure, what, is he gonna walk
through the door any minute now?

04:34.641 --> 04:35.642
Let's take a look.

04:38.011 --> 04:40.747
Oops!
No players today!

04:40.781 --> 04:42.783
Well, I gotta change.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.050
Oh..

04:46.520 --> 04:50.423
Oh, uh, if Mr. Baseball comes
through the door, let me know.

04:59.065 --> 05:00.300
Hello, chief.

05:02.002 --> 05:06.573
My name is Balki but my friends
call me Mr. Baseball.

05:15.381 --> 05:18.051
Uh‐huh, uh, so,
so you‐you don't think

05:18.084 --> 05:20.386
he'll be out of prison in time
to play the game on Saturday?

05:21.855 --> 05:24.591
Yeah, well, o‐o‐okay.
Uh, thank you.

05:24.625 --> 05:27.360
Cousin, I got you something
for your nervous stomach.

05:27.393 --> 05:29.029
Oh, thanks.

05:29.062 --> 05:29.896
Uh.

05:35.435 --> 05:38.772
So, uh, have you had
any luck replacing Slugger?

05:38.805 --> 05:40.006
No.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.542
I'm a loser.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.710
I've always been a loser.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.846
If there was a contest
for losers, I'd be a winner.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.652
‐ Cousin?
‐ Mm..

05:51.685 --> 05:52.653
I'll play.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.388
Play what?

05:56.957 --> 05:58.124
Baseball.

05:58.158 --> 05:59.993
You need a player,
I'll play.

06:00.026 --> 06:03.063
Uh, thank you, Balki,
I appreciate the offer.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.965
But there's no way
you could replace Slugger.

06:04.998 --> 06:06.499
Why no?

06:06.533 --> 06:08.769
Well, for one thing
you've never played before!

06:08.802 --> 06:11.605
We need somebody
who can help us win.

06:11.638 --> 06:13.139
But Cousin, at the beginning
of the season

06:13.173 --> 06:15.876
you said that‐that
we're just playing for fun

06:15.909 --> 06:17.911
and it don't matter
if we win or lose.

06:17.944 --> 06:18.679
I did?

06:20.046 --> 06:21.014
Oh, yeah!

06:21.047 --> 06:23.116
Well, that was before
I thought we had a chance.

06:24.985 --> 06:28.889
Now we're one game away
from my trophy.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.557
Is getting a trophy
so important?

06:30.591 --> 06:31.858
It's more important
than life.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.795
Didn't I ever tell you
about my brother Billy?

06:36.630 --> 06:37.931
The one who locked
you in the attic

06:37.964 --> 06:38.899
for three days?

06:40.534 --> 06:41.635
No, that was
my brother Danny.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.740
Billy, the one that hold you
down and cut off all your hair.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.075
No, that was
my sister Elaine.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.580
No, little Larry
and Billy Appleton

06:53.614 --> 06:55.448
shared the same room.

06:55.481 --> 06:57.450
We had identical beds

06:57.483 --> 07:01.054
two identical desks,
two identical bookshelves.

07:01.087 --> 07:04.658
Only Billy's bookshelves
were filled with trophies.

07:04.691 --> 07:07.994
Bowling trophies, tennis
trophies, track trophies.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.063
Billy was a born winner.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.832
You know what I had
on my bookshelf?

07:13.834 --> 07:17.938
A wooden replica of
a wheel of cheddar cheese

07:17.971 --> 07:20.140
with a plaque that said

07:20.173 --> 07:23.810
"First Place‐Wisconsin
State Fair Cheese Throw."

07:25.912 --> 07:27.614
Wow!

07:30.116 --> 07:32.118
I bet Billy
was pretty jealous!

07:37.591 --> 07:38.792
It was Billy's trophy.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.929
He didn't want it
on his side of the room.

07:42.963 --> 07:46.166
Just once I'd like
to have my own trophy.

07:46.199 --> 07:47.768
And I‐I want
to help you win it!

07:47.801 --> 07:50.070
‐ Ah! Ah!
‐ Please? Please?

07:50.103 --> 07:52.773
Cousin, I know I can
toss the old horsehide

07:52.806 --> 07:55.876
around the horn if you
just tell me what a horn is.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.213
Alright, lo‐look,
I'll tell you what.

08:00.246 --> 08:03.083
You can practice with the team
tomorrow and then we'll see

08:03.116 --> 08:04.518
if there's a place for you.

08:04.551 --> 08:05.786
I want practice now.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.220
Now, Balki,
you can't practice now.

08:07.253 --> 08:08.221
It's too late
to go to the park.

08:08.254 --> 08:09.756
I want practice now.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.024
You can't practice
in the house.

08:11.057 --> 08:12.793
I want to play baseball.

08:16.630 --> 08:17.764

08:20.100 --> 08:22.168
You're not gonna
let this go, are you?

08:24.137 --> 08:26.573
‐ No, I'm not.
‐ Oh.

08:28.809 --> 08:31.011
Alright.
We'll practice now.

08:31.044 --> 08:31.978
Oh, boy!

08:34.681 --> 08:35.881
I'm ready.

08:36.883 --> 08:37.884
Not really.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.688
You're not going to
destroy the living room

08:42.722 --> 08:45.191
so you'll use these
socks for a ball.

08:45.225 --> 08:49.029
Now...what position would
you sort of like to try to play?

he's the one

08:57.103 --> 08:58.772

to the manager the most.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.641
And that's..

09:00.674 --> 09:01.908
That's you.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.916
Al‐alright, alright.

09:09.950 --> 09:13.754
Here, you take this,
go over there.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.088
Move the chair
out of the way.

09:15.121 --> 09:17.791
I'll move the TV
so we don't break anything.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.962
Alright, now.

09:23.229 --> 09:26.166
Just try to get it past me.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.902
Don't throw it hard,
or you're gonna break something.

09:28.935 --> 09:32.906
'Just nice and easy.
A real fluid motion.'

09:32.939 --> 09:35.275
Don't try to throw
a curve or a slider.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.778
You just wanna put it
right over the middle.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.279
Alright?
Just toss it in.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.647
Just up..

09:40.681 --> 09:42.182
'...and over.'

09:42.215 --> 09:45.385
Wanna toss it up
and over the plate. Okay?

09:45.418 --> 09:47.621
Just up and over.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.926
‐ What are you waiting for?
‐ For you to stop talking.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.765
Okay, I've stopped.

09:59.700 --> 10:00.867
Play ball.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.857
Don't be ridi‐‐

10:23.890 --> 10:25.325
[shouting]
Will you just throw the ball!

10:46.479 --> 10:47.280
Strike one.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.759
[door unlocking]

11:13.006 --> 11:14.941
Did I do good
at practice today?

11:16.442 --> 11:19.379
I can safely say
that I have never seen

11:19.412 --> 11:22.015
baseball played the way
you played it today.

11:24.150 --> 11:26.086
And I'll do just as good
against the Spartans.

11:29.155 --> 11:30.857
That's just
what I'm afraid of.

11:34.060 --> 11:35.929
You know what I liked?

11:35.962 --> 11:38.264
‐ Sliding?
‐ I liked sliding.

11:42.969 --> 11:46.239
You slid head first
into every base.

11:46.272 --> 11:48.308
When you should've
been playing right field.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.044
It was fun.

11:52.513 --> 11:55.448
Fun does not win trophies.

11:55.481 --> 11:58.051
And you never even took
batting practice.

11:58.084 --> 12:00.320
So‐so what position
do I play?

12:00.353 --> 12:01.321
Well..

12:02.122 --> 12:03.890
Balki..

12:03.924 --> 12:05.158
We have to
talk about that.

12:06.927 --> 12:07.928
You‐you..

12:07.961 --> 12:09.295
You remember I told you

12:09.329 --> 12:12.432
baseball is a very
complicated game.

12:12.465 --> 12:15.068
‐ Well, I don't think that you..
‐ It's also very wonderful.

12:16.302 --> 12:19.239
Well, yes,
I guess it is.

12:19.272 --> 12:23.009
‐ I don't think you should..
‐ You know..

12:23.043 --> 12:26.479
When‐when we
were at home on‐on Mypos

12:26.513 --> 12:30.250
we used to hear about the great
American game of baseball.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.553
And, and tomorrow

12:32.586 --> 12:36.489
I, Balki Bartokomous..

12:36.523 --> 12:38.124
...a lowly sheepherder..

12:39.492 --> 12:42.262
...would be the first
Mypiot in history

12:42.295 --> 12:44.865
to put on a baseball
uniform and play

12:44.898 --> 12:46.967
the greatest game
ever invented.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.879
So...what did you
want to tell me?

13:08.121 --> 13:12.458
Balki, I, ah,
I really don't think

13:12.492 --> 13:14.127
that‐that‐that, uh..

13:15.929 --> 13:18.364
you should be
up late tonight.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.201
Why don't you
hit the showers

13:21.234 --> 13:22.468
and get a good night's sleep

13:22.503 --> 13:25.572
because tomorrow
is a big, big day.

13:25.606 --> 13:27.541
"Big day."

13:27.574 --> 13:29.175
‐ I'm going to write home.
‐ Mm.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.011
When they hear
about this on Mypos

13:31.044 --> 13:32.145
they'll throw me a parade.

13:33.179 --> 13:34.014
Of course,
I won't be there

13:34.047 --> 13:37.217
but...they'll
send me the drawings.

13:50.196 --> 13:52.232
[telephone ringing]

13:57.403 --> 14:00.206
Hello?
Oh, hello, Mr. Twinkacetti.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.543
No, I‐I haven't found
a replacement for Slugger yet.

14:02.576 --> 14:03.977
But..

14:04.010 --> 14:05.646
You have?

14:05.679 --> 14:07.981
Duke Lyle?

14:08.014 --> 14:09.382
Well, how did you get someone
as good as Duke to‐‐

14:10.651 --> 14:12.285
You're gonna pay him $50, hmm?

14:13.687 --> 14:15.221
I'm gonna pay him $50.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.859
No, no, I think
he's worth every penny.

14:19.492 --> 14:20.961
Yeah, alright.

14:20.994 --> 14:21.628
I'll see you tomorrow.

14:23.530 --> 14:24.531
Duke Lyle.

14:25.699 --> 14:28.502
Tomorrow, I get my trophy.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.605
In your face,
Billy Appleton.

[instrumental music]

14:53.126 --> 14:55.061
Okay, alright.
On the field.

14:55.095 --> 14:58.131
Let's‐let's practice.
Warm up. Let's go.

14:58.164 --> 15:00.100
Appleton, this is
Duke Lyle.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.135
The man who's gonna win
this one for me.

15:02.168 --> 15:03.637
Ah, Duke,
this is the manager.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.972
Don't feel compelled
to pay any attention to him.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.308
Duke, it's a pleasure.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.611
You can't imagine what it means
to me to have you with us today.

15:10.644 --> 15:13.947
Who cares?
Where's my 50 bucks?

15:13.980 --> 15:15.181
I love this guy.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.718
[laughing]

15:17.751 --> 15:19.419
Yeah, you might wanna
go out and shag a few.

15:19.452 --> 15:22.055
Uh, if you're in the mood.

15:22.623 --> 15:23.924
Yeah, sure.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.627
Hope he's worth 50 bucks.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.132
Balki, where have
you been?

15:32.165 --> 15:33.634
Getting this!

15:38.404 --> 15:39.439
Pretty sharp, huh?

15:41.041 --> 15:44.044
Now I look like a real
American baseball player.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.046
It cost a lot of digdas,
but it's worth it.

15:47.313 --> 15:49.550
Oh, I wish you
hadn't done that.

15:49.583 --> 15:52.485
The game is about to start.
Everybody, over here.

15:53.554 --> 15:54.521
Oh.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.259
Alright, now..

15:59.292 --> 16:02.028
I don't have to tell you
how much this game means.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.165
But I will anyway.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.534
It means a lot.

16:07.568 --> 16:10.303
Now get out there
and win it!

16:10.336 --> 16:12.706
If not for yourselves..

16:12.739 --> 16:14.107
...then for me!

16:14.140 --> 16:15.509
Now go!
Get out there!

16:15.542 --> 16:16.543
(in unison)
Yay! Yay!

16:16.577 --> 16:18.311
Balki, back here.

16:20.581 --> 16:22.348
Uh, you won't be
starting the game.

16:23.349 --> 16:24.484
‐ I won't?
‐ No.

16:24.518 --> 16:25.552
Why no?

16:25.586 --> 16:27.353
Well, uh..

16:27.387 --> 16:30.323
..baseball is a game of
strategy as well as skill.

16:30.356 --> 16:31.625
And I've given it
a lot of thought

16:31.658 --> 16:33.359
and I've come
to the conclusion

16:33.393 --> 16:36.196
that you're just
too important to the team

16:36.229 --> 16:37.731
to be wasted playing
the whole game.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.103
Do you mean,
I'm like a secret weapon?

16:43.136 --> 16:46.339
Right‐right. Right, yes.
Right, exactly.

16:46.372 --> 16:47.808
You are my secret weapon.

16:47.841 --> 16:51.244
And when the time is right,
I'll unload my secret weapon

16:51.277 --> 16:53.514
and they won't
know what hit them.

16:53.547 --> 16:57.450
‐ Cousin, you are a genius.
‐ Hm.

16:57.483 --> 17:00.821
When will be the right time
for you to unload me?

17:00.854 --> 17:03.824
Uh, um, uh, um..

17:03.857 --> 17:04.758
I'll let you know.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.529
Alright.
I'll be waiting.

Alright, alright,
don't try to kill the ball.

17:49.570 --> 17:52.606
There's only one out.
Scheinwald is on first.

17:52.639 --> 17:55.241
All you wanna do is move him
into scoring position.

17:55.275 --> 17:58.211
‐ 'That's all you have..'
‐ Strike three! You're out!

17:58.244 --> 17:59.479
Why is she looking at me?

18:03.316 --> 18:05.318
Cousin, I couldn't
help noticing

18:05.351 --> 18:07.554
that it's the bottom
of the ninth.

18:07.588 --> 18:09.455
When are you going to unload
your secret weapon?

18:11.191 --> 18:12.659
Darn, I don't believe it.

18:12.693 --> 18:14.595
It's alright,
it's alright.

18:14.628 --> 18:16.229
No, it isn't.
I broke a nail.

18:18.565 --> 18:20.867
We still have a chance.
Duke is up.

18:20.901 --> 18:22.302
Time out, please.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.270
You don't call time out.
I call time out.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.839
‐ Time!
‐ Time is out.

18:27.407 --> 18:30.310
What is it?

18:30.343 --> 18:32.713
You're not going to
put me up, are you?

18:32.746 --> 18:35.481
Balki, we are down
to our last out.

18:35.516 --> 18:39.185
‐ But you promised.
‐ I know I promised.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.854
But I wrote home.

18:40.887 --> 18:44.390
Oh, sho‐o‐o‐ot.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.727
Balki, look, uh..

18:46.760 --> 18:50.296
...if we don't score now
we lose the championship.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.332
You understand that,
don't you?

18:52.365 --> 18:53.534
Yes, I understand.

18:53.567 --> 18:55.669
‐ You do?
‐ Yes.

18:55.702 --> 18:59.339
I understand that a trophy
is more important than a friend.

19:01.274 --> 19:04.444
O‐o‐oh, o‐o‐oh, o‐o‐oh.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.813
Now, that is unfair.

19:06.847 --> 19:10.651
That is really unfair.
I am not a selfish person.

19:10.684 --> 19:12.586
I'm not doing
this for me.

19:12.619 --> 19:15.388
I'm doing this for,
for, for..

19:15.421 --> 19:17.591
I'm doing this for me.

19:17.624 --> 19:20.193
Hey, hey,
what's going on here?

19:20.226 --> 19:21.695
Why isn't Duke at bat?

19:21.728 --> 19:23.764
Balki wanted to play.

19:23.797 --> 19:25.899
If you let the turnip play,
we lose the championship

19:25.932 --> 19:29.870
and I got a lot of money
riding on this game.

19:29.903 --> 19:31.772
Well, maybe you shouldn't have
bet on the game to begin with.

19:31.805 --> 19:34.641
If we lose the game,
we lose the championship.

19:34.675 --> 19:37.210
Which means
you lose the trophy.

19:37.243 --> 19:39.780
You'll be a loser
all your life.

19:39.813 --> 19:42.549
Appleton, send in a batter
or you'll forfeit the game.

19:43.817 --> 19:45.652
Appleton?

19:45.686 --> 19:47.087
Cousin?

19:50.957 --> 19:52.258
[sighs]

19:53.293 --> 19:55.596
Balki..

19:55.629 --> 19:56.597
...you're up!

20:03.870 --> 20:04.638
I'll take that.

20:06.707 --> 20:08.575
Loser. Loser. Loser.

20:11.411 --> 20:14.681
Alright, Balki, you have
got to get on base.

20:14.715 --> 20:17.417
Here, stand here.
Feet wide apart.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.686
Elbow in, chin down.
Keep your eye on the ball.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.421
Use the big end
of the bat.

20:23.590 --> 20:26.693
Gosh, it's almost
like cheating.

20:26.727 --> 20:28.629
One of you two
has got to leave.

20:32.032 --> 20:33.800
Guess that would be me.

20:36.503 --> 20:38.639
'Balki, you can do it,
just relax.'

20:38.672 --> 20:40.240
Just try to meet the ball.

20:42.876 --> 20:44.277
Strike one!

20:44.310 --> 20:46.446
‐ 'Yay! Yay!'
‐ I wasn't ready.

20:46.479 --> 20:47.781
Well, get ready.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.518
Strike two!

20:51.552 --> 20:53.486
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

20:53.520 --> 20:54.588
I didn't like that one.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.291
Well, you only get three.

20:58.324 --> 21:01.695
Three? Oh, right,
it's four balls.

21:01.728 --> 21:04.030
I get that mixed up.

21:04.064 --> 21:05.799
Three strikes
and you're out.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.367
So should I hit this one?

21:07.400 --> 21:09.503
Yes!
Dear God, yes!

21:10.871 --> 21:12.806
[dramatic music]

21:34.595 --> 21:35.829
‐ Whoa!
‐ Whoa!

21:35.862 --> 21:36.963
Will you look at that?

21:39.933 --> 21:41.702
I hit it.
I hit it!

21:41.735 --> 21:43.670
(Larry)
'Run! Run!'

21:43.704 --> 21:46.072
No, the other way!
The other way down here!

21:46.106 --> 21:47.608
Take a left, take a left.

21:47.641 --> 21:50.043
Yes, go. All the way.
All the way.

21:50.076 --> 21:52.345
[crowd cheering]

21:52.378 --> 21:54.881
Come on, Balki!
That's it.

21:54.915 --> 21:56.650
Why is he sliding
into every base?

21:56.683 --> 21:57.884
Because he likes to.

21:57.918 --> 21:59.385
You got a problem
with that?

22:01.722 --> 22:02.723
Yes!

[crowd cheering]

22:07.160 --> 22:08.494
[crowd applauding]

22:26.847 --> 22:28.949
Look at this.

22:28.982 --> 22:31.785
It's a cheap piece of plastic
on an imitation wood base.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.622
It's beautiful.

22:37.991 --> 22:40.093
But I almost let it
ruin our friendship.

22:42.062 --> 22:43.830
I'm sorry, Balki.

22:43.864 --> 22:46.032
You don't have
to apologize.

22:46.066 --> 22:47.668
You realize
that a trophy

22:47.701 --> 22:49.936
is not as important
as our friendship.

22:52.673 --> 22:53.707
I did the right thing,
didn't I?

22:53.740 --> 22:55.441
You bet you did.

22:55.475 --> 22:57.377
You know,
the best part is..

22:58.679 --> 23:01.081
...I did the right thing
and we won anyway.

23:12.458 --> 23:14.895
Boy, you hit
that ball a mile.

23:14.928 --> 23:17.698
Oh, well, I knew
I could hit a ball.

23:17.731 --> 23:19.666

always very good at

Yay , it means, "The game where
you hit rocks with a stick."

23:43.123 --> 23:44.991
How do you play?

23:45.025 --> 23:47.661
You hit rocks
with a stick.

I always felt there was
something missing from the game.
