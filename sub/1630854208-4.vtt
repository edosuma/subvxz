No, he ain't
about that life.

09:35.662 --> 09:38.621
H-He's all Easy Rider,
being free, living off the grid.

09:38.752 --> 09:40.667
He got beef
with anyone?

09:42.712 --> 09:45.019
[sighs] Look, look...

09:45.149 --> 09:47.935
T-Bone and our leader,
Buffalo Joe, used to be tight,

09:48.065 --> 09:50.024
all right?
But now, there's beef.

09:50.154 --> 09:51.416
They even threw hands
a week ago.

09:51.547 --> 09:54.202
We had to break it up.What was it about?

09:54.332 --> 09:56.378
If I knew,
I'd tell you, I swear.

09:56.508 --> 09:59.163
Ah!
If you lying,

09:59.294 --> 10:01.949
I'll be back, and you
won't like our reunion.

10:02.079 --> 10:03.777
[grunts]

10:13.221 --> 10:16.833
Okay, understood.
I'll keep you posted.

10:16.964 --> 10:18.922
[phone beeps]Rob's headed over to the
Brooklyn Disciples' clubhouse.

10:19.053 --> 10:20.707
She wants us to look
into Buffalo Joe.

10:20.837 --> 10:22.447
Well, according
to their social,

10:22.578 --> 10:23.753
the Brooklyn Disciples
were formed

10:23.884 --> 10:26.016
over 30 years ago
by Buffalo Joe.

10:26.147 --> 10:28.279
Wait a minute,
they have social media?

10:28.410 --> 10:30.673
Oh, yeah. They even sell, uh,
coffee mugs and T-shirts.

10:30.804 --> 10:32.806
Okay. Guess they
are a club.

10:32.936 --> 10:35.069
So, why do we think
Buffalo Joe

10:35.199 --> 10:36.461
might have it out
for T-Bone?

10:36.592 --> 10:38.246
I don't know,
but I'm also wondering

10:38.376 --> 10:39.813
why Storm didn't tell Robyn
about their beef.

10:39.943 --> 10:42.380
Maybe she didn't know. I mean,
boys do keep their secrets.

10:42.511 --> 10:43.947
Hey, wait a minute,
the only secrets

10:44.078 --> 10:44.948
I ever kept
are from the government.

10:45.079 --> 10:47.037
Mm-hmm. Any luck finding
the van footage?

10:47.168 --> 10:48.996
All the cameras
in the area

10:49.126 --> 10:51.825
are either broken
or they need to be updated.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.827
There was this one on
the corner that should have

10:53.957 --> 10:56.090
a pretty good shot of the
action, but I can't get access.

10:56.220 --> 10:57.613
Might be an air-gapped
security measure.

10:57.744 --> 11:00.007
That's a serious measure
for such a small bank.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.486
I know, that's what
I was thinking.

11:01.617 --> 11:03.706
Well, I'll keep digging,
see what I can find.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.102
[siren wailing]

11:24.031 --> 11:26.076
You know, I clocked you
four blocks ago.

11:26.207 --> 11:28.165
[laughs]I must be slipping.

11:29.863 --> 11:32.648
If you wanted to talk to me
about T-Bone's van,

11:32.779 --> 11:34.606
you could've just rung me.

11:34.737 --> 11:37.435
I could've, but then you
wouldn't have gotten to try some

11:37.566 --> 11:40.961
of Brooklyn's finest,
Mabel's Donuts.

11:42.527 --> 11:45.226
Hey, you know,
my grandmother used to say

11:45.356 --> 11:47.228
you can't buy happiness,
but you can buy donuts,

11:47.358 --> 11:49.665
and that's kind of
the same thing.
[laughs]

11:49.796 --> 11:52.146
My kind of lady.[phone vibrates]

11:57.934 --> 11:59.240
One of those days?

12:01.024 --> 12:02.417
One of those weeks.

12:04.027 --> 12:05.768
Always here if you need to talk.

12:08.858 --> 12:10.381
I appreciate that.

12:10.512 --> 12:11.948
I really do.

12:13.776 --> 12:16.083
I got a look at T-Bone's van
in the police impound.

12:16.213 --> 12:18.041
Pretty clear someone
hot-wired it.

12:18.172 --> 12:21.610
So, Storm was telling the truth.
Someone is trying to set him up.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.134
All I know is someone's flooding
Brooklyn's streets with guns.

12:24.265 --> 12:25.788
Where are the guns coming from?

12:25.919 --> 12:28.399
Guns are bought down south
with softer gun laws,

12:28.530 --> 12:30.532
then moved up north and
sold illegally by traffickers.

12:30.662 --> 12:32.142
The old Iron Pipeline.

12:32.273 --> 12:34.405
Exactly, which is
impossible to track.

12:34.536 --> 12:36.581
How about you?
Harry or Mel have any leads?

12:36.712 --> 12:39.584
Well, Harry's trying to get
access to an ATM camera

12:39.715 --> 12:41.630
that was near where
the van was found.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.066
Hoping for a clue.

12:43.197 --> 12:46.156
Okay. I'm gonna re-canvass
the crime scene,

12:46.287 --> 12:48.289
see if the cops
missed anything.

12:48.419 --> 12:50.465
I was on my way to see
the leader of the club,

12:50.595 --> 12:52.989
Buffalo Joe.

12:53.120 --> 12:56.253
That is, before I was kidnapped
by the Donut Bandit.

12:57.428 --> 12:59.169
Hey.

13:00.605 --> 13:01.693
Can I see you later?

13:01.824 --> 13:02.738
I don't know,

13:02.869 --> 13:05.132
can you?

13:06.133 --> 13:08.265
There's a rise in crime
in Brooklyn,

13:08.396 --> 13:10.615
and the problem
is clear.

13:10.746 --> 13:12.008
Long-term Councilman Moore
is in bed

13:12.139 --> 13:13.183
with criminal groups
that flood

13:13.314 --> 13:14.881
our streets with guns.

13:15.011 --> 13:16.752
So, it's time for a change.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.928
It's time for a new generation.

13:19.059 --> 13:20.887
Vote for me, and I'll get

13:21.017 --> 13:22.062
these guns
off our streets.

13:22.192 --> 13:23.063
MAN: That's what
we need in BK!

13:23.193 --> 13:24.760
Excuse me, ma'am.

13:24.891 --> 13:26.631
My name's
Detective Dante.

13:26.762 --> 13:28.720
I-I'm Bettie Bass.
So good to meet you.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.505
I know who you are, Mrs. Bass.

13:30.635 --> 13:32.594
When I was growing up,
your husband was the best mayor

13:32.724 --> 13:35.597
New York ever had,
and you were arguably its queen.

13:35.727 --> 13:37.860
[chuckles] Thank you,
but today I'm simply

13:37.991 --> 13:39.557
stumping for
my son's campaign.

13:39.688 --> 13:41.777
Can I ask you
a question then?Of course.

13:41.908 --> 13:44.127
What did your son mean
when he said Councilman Moore

13:44.258 --> 13:45.346
was tied up
with organized crime?

13:45.476 --> 13:47.957
Elijah Moore grew up
with the leader

13:48.088 --> 13:49.698
of the
Brooklyn Disciples.

13:49.829 --> 13:53.180
Guns were found in one
of the gang member's vans.

13:53.310 --> 13:54.964
You're the detective.

13:55.095 --> 13:57.053
I'll let you
connect the dots.

13:57.184 --> 13:59.839
All due respect, Mrs. Bass,
but the Brooklyn Disciples

13:59.969 --> 14:02.232
and Councilman Moore have been
pillars of this community

14:02.363 --> 14:03.668
for years, and if...

14:03.799 --> 14:05.192
Good people of Brooklyn.

14:05.322 --> 14:07.542
I know you can see through
this mudslinging

14:07.672 --> 14:10.806
by one of New York's
oldest and richest families,

14:10.937 --> 14:12.199
whose attacks

14:12.329 --> 14:15.680
upon me are only to hide
their own history

14:15.811 --> 14:17.160
of political
dirty pool.

14:17.291 --> 14:19.032
How dare you attack
my family name.

14:19.162 --> 14:20.860
That family name
is the only reason

14:20.990 --> 14:22.252
you're even on the ballot, kid.

14:22.383 --> 14:23.819
We'll see at
our debate tomorrow.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.342
The truth will
finally come out.

14:25.473 --> 14:27.779
MOORE:
The truth? That'd be
a first for a Bass.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.999
[laughs]
You know where
you can stick that?

14:30.130 --> 14:31.827
Save it for
tomorrow, dear.

14:31.958 --> 14:34.395
Yeah, that's right.

Buffalo Joe, and T-Bone?

One hour later,

also an empty street.MEL: Okay.

18:25.495 --> 18:27.062
But we know the van
was there.

18:27.193 --> 18:29.760
Someone must've erased
hours' worth of footage.

18:29.891 --> 18:32.154
Right, but not
just someone, right?

18:32.285 --> 18:33.677
It had to be somebody
that worked at the bank

18:33.808 --> 18:34.765
because they're the only people
that have access

18:34.896 --> 18:36.463
to the ATM footage.

18:36.593 --> 18:37.725
Well, how many people
work at the bank?

18:37.855 --> 18:39.030
Thirty-four.

18:39.161 --> 18:41.772
But one of them,
a teller,

18:41.903 --> 18:44.601
Eddie Pagan,
made $75,000 last year,

18:44.732 --> 18:47.169

he was, uh, magically able

18:47.300 --> 18:50.694
to make his wife's $33,000
in medical bills go away.

the lottery, or...

19:18.244 --> 19:19.636
Mm-hmm.Okay.

19:19.767 --> 19:20.855
I'll be back.

19:23.031 --> 19:24.075
Can I help you?

19:26.817 --> 19:28.515
I just want to ask Councilman
Moore a few questions.

19:28.645 --> 19:30.604
Is this about the Bass family's
allegations against him?

19:30.734 --> 19:32.997
I'd rather discuss this
with Councilman Moore.

19:33.128 --> 19:35.957
I get that, but it's my job
to protect the councilman.

19:36.087 --> 19:37.437
He's a little busy
right now.

19:37.567 --> 19:38.829
If he has nothing to hide,
he has nothing

19:38.960 --> 19:40.918
to worry about. I just
want to talk to him.

19:44.095 --> 19:47.011
Leo, stand down. Apologies.

19:47.142 --> 19:48.448
My security
gets a little

19:48.578 --> 19:50.363
overprotective.

19:50.493 --> 19:52.843
Come in, please.

19:55.846 --> 19:57.239
Get you a drink?

19:58.545 --> 19:59.285
[grunts]

20:01.330 --> 20:03.593
[sighs] So...

20:03.724 --> 20:05.595
Detective Dante,

20:05.726 --> 20:07.162
how can I help you?

20:07.293 --> 20:08.903
I just have a few questions.

20:09.033 --> 20:10.426
Starting with:

20:10.557 --> 20:12.428
what's your connection
to Tasha "Storm" Murray,

20:12.559 --> 20:14.474
and why are you letting her live
in an apartment you own?

20:14.604 --> 20:17.172
I can't see why that's
any of your concern.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.522
It should be your concern.
All these ties

20:19.653 --> 20:21.089
to the Brooklyn Disciples
feeds right into

20:21.220 --> 20:22.525
the Bass family's narrative.

20:22.656 --> 20:25.136
Not that I have to
answer this, but...

20:25.267 --> 20:28.270
all of the Brooklyn Disciples
are innocent.

20:28.401 --> 20:30.838
This is just political theater.

20:30.968 --> 20:32.927
DANTE:
Then why are Buffalo Joe
and T-Bone

20:33.057 --> 20:34.189
on the run?

20:34.320 --> 20:37.192
I've never run
in my whole life.

20:38.715 --> 20:40.195
Then what do you call this?

20:40.326 --> 20:42.066
I call this me trying
to fix this.

20:42.197 --> 20:43.503
Storm told me
she went to

20:43.633 --> 20:44.808
that woman that
showed up at our club,

20:44.939 --> 20:46.114
which was a mistake.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.202
Trust me.
She's just trying to help.

20:47.333 --> 20:48.464
You should let her.

20:48.595 --> 20:49.857
Trust you?
That's a tall order

20:49.987 --> 20:51.989
coming from Big Ben's kid.

20:52.120 --> 20:54.340
I'm my own man.

20:54.470 --> 20:56.167
MOORE:
I heard he's a...

20:56.298 --> 20:58.431
straight shooter.

20:59.606 --> 21:01.042
Well, then start shooting.

21:01.172 --> 21:02.652
What about the beef
between you and T-Bone?

21:02.783 --> 21:04.088
This have to do with Storm?

21:08.005 --> 21:09.529
It does.

21:09.659 --> 21:12.749
Storm's father was a good friend
that died suddenly.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.882
We're her godfathers.

21:15.012 --> 21:17.972
And in the club,
one cardinal rule:

21:18.102 --> 21:21.845
no one gets with Storm,
and T-Bone broke that.

21:21.976 --> 21:23.717
So, why didn't Storm
mention that?

21:23.847 --> 21:26.067
BUFFALO JOE:
Storm knew I would never hurt
a fellow member.

21:26.197 --> 21:28.678
Even though I felt
betrayed by T-Bone,

21:28.809 --> 21:29.940
our thing is purely personal.

21:30.071 --> 21:32.029
If it wasn't you,

21:32.160 --> 21:34.031
then who is setting up T-Bone
and why?

21:34.162 --> 21:36.077
T-Bone used to bounce

21:36.207 --> 21:38.079
at this club
a month ago,

21:38.209 --> 21:39.994
and things got foul.

21:40.124 --> 21:42.518
He say what happened?He didn't want to talk about it.

21:42.649 --> 21:44.520
You remember the name
of the club?

21:44.651 --> 21:45.739
La Rosa.

21:51.919 --> 21:54.313
Hey, Eddie.Can I help you?

21:54.443 --> 21:56.271
Yeah. We need to talk to you.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.012
Was that your
gym membership card?

21:58.142 --> 21:59.535
Come on, you think I'm stupid?

21:59.666 --> 22:00.841
How about this?

22:02.973 --> 22:04.366
Yeah, that's all
of your bank info,

22:04.497 --> 22:06.455
including a pretty hefty
cash transfer

22:06.586 --> 22:08.979
from a few days ago.MEL: The good news is you're not

22:09.110 --> 22:10.503
the one we're after.

22:10.633 --> 22:12.548
The IRS might be interested,
though, so...

22:12.679 --> 22:15.246
Why don't you just
tell us what happened?

22:15.377 --> 22:17.161
Okay, look, I was approached
by a man who said

22:17.292 --> 22:19.250
he would pay me handsomely

22:19.381 --> 22:21.862
if I were to find
this ATM bank video

22:21.992 --> 22:23.080
and cut out some footage.

22:23.211 --> 22:24.908
So, what'd you cut?

22:25.039 --> 22:26.910
[sighs] It was footage
of a man pulling in a van,

22:27.041 --> 22:28.869
opening the door,
and walking away. That's it.

22:28.999 --> 22:30.087
Do you remember
what the guy looked like?

22:30.218 --> 22:32.829
He was fit, he wore a cap,

22:32.960 --> 22:35.397
he had sunglasses,
and he had polished shoes,

22:35.528 --> 22:36.746
and tan slacks.

22:36.877 --> 22:38.792
Right, what about,
uh, marks, tattoos?

22:38.922 --> 22:41.534
As a matter of fact,
on his wrist,

22:41.664 --> 22:43.797
but I could only see
part of it. It was, um,

22:43.927 --> 22:45.451
it was a sun
with the number seven on it.

22:45.581 --> 22:48.454
All right. Thanks, Eddie.MEL: Okay.

22:51.979 --> 22:54.111
[door opens, closes]

22:54.242 --> 22:55.765
Hey, Miles.

22:55.896 --> 22:58.159
Good to see you.

22:58.289 --> 22:59.639
[chuckles] Is it?

22:59.769 --> 23:01.815
Yeah, it is.

23:03.730 --> 23:05.296
Aunt Vi and Dee here?

23:05.427 --> 23:07.298
No. No, I asked them
to step out.

23:07.429 --> 23:10.345
And, uh, they missed
the repairman and

23:10.476 --> 23:11.999
wrangled you
into it.

23:12.129 --> 23:14.915
Yeah. I can't fix this.

23:15.045 --> 23:17.700
I've done surgeries
less complicated than that.

23:17.831 --> 23:19.441
I know you have.

23:21.095 --> 23:22.618
[sighs]

23:22.749 --> 23:25.534
So, I've been trying
to talk to you for a couple

23:25.665 --> 23:27.928
weeks, you've been
avoiding me. How come?

23:28.058 --> 23:30.060
I just, you know, uh,

23:30.191 --> 23:32.411
I've been meaning to call you,
but the...Come on.

23:32.541 --> 23:34.804
Rob, tell me the truth.

23:34.935 --> 23:36.850
What have you
gotten into?

23:36.980 --> 23:39.026
Are you back with the CIA?

23:41.115 --> 23:43.247
Even if you were, you
wouldn't tell me, would you?

23:43.378 --> 23:44.684
All right, look, first,

23:44.814 --> 23:46.947
you bring a gunshot victim
to my house.

23:47.077 --> 23:49.036
Then I get a call
from Aunt Vi saying that

23:49.166 --> 23:51.299
I need to come get our daughter
'cause there's a dirty bomb

23:51.430 --> 23:53.432
about to blow up
in the city,

23:53.562 --> 23:55.303
which your absence
that day tells me

23:55.434 --> 23:56.652
you were somehow involved in.

23:56.783 --> 23:59.568
I'm concerned, Rob,
about Delilah.

23:59.699 --> 24:02.049
I know. You're right.

24:03.485 --> 24:06.053
It's a lot to deal with,

24:06.183 --> 24:08.882
but you must trust me.

24:09.012 --> 24:11.406
I wouldn't do anything
to put our daughter in danger.

24:11.537 --> 24:13.234
Rob, you already have.

24:13.364 --> 24:15.628
Now, you gonna tell me
the truth or no?

24:15.758 --> 24:19.414
Miles, when the time
is right, I will,

24:19.545 --> 24:22.243
but, right now,

24:22.373 --> 24:24.419
I can't.Okay.

24:24.550 --> 24:27.422
I tried. You leave me no choice.

24:27.553 --> 24:29.772
Wait, what's that
supposed to mean?

24:29.903 --> 24:32.645
I'm filing for full custody
of Delilah.

24:34.168 --> 24:35.691
[scoffs]

24:35.822 --> 24:37.693
That's not gonna happen.Well, then I hope

24:37.824 --> 24:39.869
you're ready to tell the court
what you won't tell me.

24:47.877 --> 24:50.880
[door opens, closes]

24:54.971 --> 24:58.061
[singsongy]: Fresh made.
Good morning.

24:58.192 --> 25:00.499
Thank you. I need this.

25:00.629 --> 25:01.891
You all right?

25:02.022 --> 25:03.850
Miles came by.

25:03.980 --> 25:05.634
Between the gunshot
victim and the

25:05.765 --> 25:08.202
dirty bomb scare, he wants
permanent custody of Delilah.

25:08.332 --> 25:09.377
He can't do that.

25:09.508 --> 25:10.987
I'm not so sure about that.

25:11.118 --> 25:12.119
[scoffs]

25:12.249 --> 25:14.077
He takes me to court,

25:14.208 --> 25:15.601
how do I explain all this?

25:15.731 --> 25:18.386
Rob, Miles has got to know

25:18.517 --> 25:20.301
that you would never let
anything happen to Dee.

25:20.431 --> 25:21.824
But I already have.

25:21.955 --> 25:24.044
It's only by luck
that Quinn

25:24.174 --> 25:26.089
didn't grab Aunt Vi
and Dee.

25:26.220 --> 25:28.265
And he could've.And if he did,
you would've saved them.

25:28.396 --> 25:30.180
That's not the point.

25:30.311 --> 25:32.574
I promised to keep
my family safe.

25:32.705 --> 25:33.575
The question is,

25:33.706 --> 25:36.622
can I even keep that promise?

25:39.799 --> 25:41.583
[console beeping]What's that?

25:41.714 --> 25:43.890
I've been shaking
the trees a little bit

25:44.020 --> 25:45.848
on our favorite fugitive,
T-Bone,

25:45.979 --> 25:47.894
and even though he doesn't
have a digital footprint,

25:48.024 --> 25:50.897
his favorite motorcycle
Josephine does.

25:51.027 --> 25:53.073
And our old pal

25:53.203 --> 25:54.988
Shorty Pinto's been getting
some parking tickets

25:55.118 --> 25:56.424
at this abandoned
building,

25:56.555 --> 25:58.687
and he just got one
five minutes ago.

25:58.818 --> 26:01.124
T-Bone's used to
living off the grid,

26:01.255 --> 26:03.692
it might be a perfect place
for him to lay low.

26:03.823 --> 26:05.564
I knew Shorty was lying.

26:05.694 --> 26:07.130
I'm gonna
check it out.

26:07.261 --> 26:08.915
Let me know if you hear
anything from Dante

26:09.045 --> 26:10.786
about what happened
at that night club.

26:13.746 --> 26:15.443
Come on, T-Bone.

26:19.665 --> 26:21.492
Oh, no, you got
to be kidding me.

26:21.623 --> 26:22.755
Hey, Shorty.

26:24.191 --> 26:26.236
Yo, T-Bone, that's her.

26:37.944 --> 26:40.337
T-Bone. T-Bone, wait.
I'm trying to help you.

26:41.295 --> 26:42.688
Who are you?

26:42.818 --> 26:44.733
I'm a friend of Storm's.[scoffs]

26:44.864 --> 26:46.343
She's worried about you.

26:46.474 --> 26:48.476
Storm needs to move on.

26:48.607 --> 26:49.999
We both know
how this story ends.

26:50.130 --> 26:51.392
I can help.

26:51.522 --> 26:52.785
You just
have to tell me

26:52.915 --> 26:54.525
who's trying
to frame you and why.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.876
Nobody can help me.

26:59.922 --> 27:03.143
Whatever this is,
it's not worth dying for.

27:03.273 --> 27:04.884
Somebody has to pay.

27:05.014 --> 27:08.583
My name and my honor
are all I have.

27:10.237 --> 27:12.195
They're absolutely
worth dying for.

27:13.893 --> 27:14.807
T-Bone.

27:14.937 --> 27:16.069
[gun clicks]

27:16.199 --> 27:17.200
T-Bone.

27:17.331 --> 27:19.072
Don't do this.

27:30.170 --> 27:33.216
[sighs] I just had
a close call with T-Bone.

27:33.347 --> 27:35.697
He's armed, he's dangerous,
and out for revenge.

27:35.828 --> 27:38.004
DANTE [over phone]:
And I think I know why.
There was a record

27:38.134 --> 27:39.962
in the police logs
of an assault at La Rosa,

27:40.093 --> 27:41.572
but once officers arrived,

27:41.703 --> 27:43.270
everyone suddenly
had amnesia, so people

27:43.400 --> 27:45.054
were obviously scared to talk.

27:45.185 --> 27:46.795
Or someone paid
for their silence.

27:46.926 --> 27:48.275
I discovered from payroll that

27:48.405 --> 27:50.103
T-Bone wasn't the only one
that quit that night, so did

27:50.233 --> 27:52.018
a cocktail waitress.
I'm going to see

27:52.148 --> 27:53.367
if her amnesia was temporary.

27:53.497 --> 27:55.238
Okay, well, let me know what you
find out.

27:55.369 --> 27:56.718
I'm gonna try to see
if I can figure out

27:56.849 --> 27:57.893
where T-Bone is headed.

28:10.036 --> 28:11.690
Camila Rivera.Yes?

28:11.820 --> 28:12.734
NYPD. I want
to talk to you

28:12.865 --> 28:14.257
about the night
you quit La Rosa.

28:14.388 --> 28:17.696
Ay bendito.No.
I don't want any trouble.

28:17.826 --> 28:19.959
Just leave me alone.T-Bone Bennet is in trouble.

28:21.874 --> 28:23.266
Time is running out
to help him.

28:23.397 --> 28:24.920
T-Bone?

28:25.051 --> 28:26.182
What exactly happened
that night?

28:28.837 --> 28:30.273
A high roller showed up.

28:30.404 --> 28:33.494
He was tweaking,
running with hookers.

28:33.624 --> 28:37.150
He got rough with one
of the girls, so T-Bone

28:37.280 --> 28:38.978
put some handson him.

28:39.108 --> 28:41.023
Then the high roller's
team swept in.

28:41.154 --> 28:43.460
Paid off everyone
just to keep it quiet,

28:43.591 --> 28:45.419
but I just bounced.

28:45.549 --> 28:46.725
And that was it?

28:46.855 --> 28:49.292
A few days ago,

28:49.423 --> 28:51.512
this chachocame along,
saying that

28:51.642 --> 28:53.819
I should take the money
this time,

28:53.949 --> 28:56.256
and I was like, "No way."
Because they pay you,

28:56.386 --> 28:58.693
they own you.Same guy from the club?

28:58.824 --> 29:00.869
No, that was an older lady
dressed nice,

29:01.000 --> 29:03.480
but this guy, he dressed normal.

29:03.611 --> 29:05.178
Khakis, baseball cap,

29:05.308 --> 29:07.963
real plain.Any tattoos?

29:08.094 --> 29:10.009
Yes, on his wrist,

29:10.139 --> 29:11.880

a glimpse of it.

29:12.011 --> 29:14.056
Who was the high roller?

29:14.187 --> 29:15.666
Candidate Bass.

29:15.797 --> 29:17.364
MEL:
Bass?

29:17.494 --> 29:21.107
Bass's image is that of a
family man with virtuous values.

29:21.237 --> 29:22.717
I mean, he's got
political aspirations

29:22.848 --> 29:24.893
and a famous family last name.

29:25.024 --> 29:28.331
So, drugs, prostitution,
and manhandling a woman

29:28.462 --> 29:29.855
isn't something you put
on a campaign poster.

29:29.985 --> 29:32.596
No.Harry, is Candidate Bass

29:32.727 --> 29:35.034
behind Councilman Moore
in the polls?

29:37.427 --> 29:38.951
Yeah, nice call.

29:39.081 --> 29:40.169
With only a couple
of weeks left to go,

close the gap.

29:41.823 --> 29:43.216
ROBYN:
So, maybe Bass

29:43.346 --> 29:44.652
set up the Brooklyn Disciples

29:44.783 --> 29:45.871
because they're associated
with Moore.

29:46.001 --> 29:47.089
It makes sense.
It definitely

29:47.220 --> 29:48.699
would help Bass's
election chances.

29:48.830 --> 29:50.876
I mean, the crime rate is up,

29:51.006 --> 29:53.313

Councilman Moore is in bed

29:53.443 --> 29:54.836
with the criminals responsible.

29:54.967 --> 29:57.099
And Bass has the perfect patsy,

the guy who approached her

30:06.152 --> 30:07.762

30:07.893 --> 30:10.547
She did. And got a glimpse
of it-- a sun,

ROBYN:
Dante, do we know where Bass is?

30:35.616 --> 30:37.444
He's about to debate
Councilman Moore. Why?

30:37.574 --> 30:39.402
Because I think that's
where T-Bone is headed.

30:39.533 --> 30:40.664

for being set up,
