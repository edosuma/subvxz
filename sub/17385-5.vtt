I mean, that's how
powerful the show was.

08:48.325 --> 08:51.393
Huge step forward for
women in television.

08:51.461 --> 08:52.827
She was the hero of her show,

08:52.896 --> 08:55.030
so not only is Lindsay Wagner like,

08:55.098 --> 08:58.566
"Aaah, she's the Bionic Woman,"
it's revolutionary as well, man.

08:58.635 --> 09:01.102
And you brought to the
role of Jaime Sommers, uh...

09:01.171 --> 09:02.704
there was a certain tenderness.

09:02.773 --> 09:04.406
I don't know, a lot
superheroines stand there, like,

09:04.474 --> 09:08.703
they just want to
scowl and just be badass

09:08.728 --> 09:11.144
100% of the time and not
show that gentle side.

09:11.169 --> 09:12.447
That was our goal.

09:12.516 --> 09:14.382
I wanted to keep her a woman.

09:14.451 --> 09:16.430
I didn't want her to be a man in a skirt

09:16.455 --> 09:17.886
coming into a man's role.

09:17.954 --> 09:20.622
That's why we had a lot of times
a lot more humor in the show.

09:20.649 --> 09:23.316
We also had her thinking about things

09:23.341 --> 09:24.500
instead of just going in and going,

09:24.539 --> 09:26.338
"Bonk! I win because I'm stronger."

09:26.363 --> 09:29.230
There's no point in trying
anything, Miss Sommers.

09:29.299 --> 09:30.365
You're surrounded.

09:30.434 --> 09:33.401
We know you're a bionic woman.

09:33.470 --> 09:35.303
No, sir.

09:35.372 --> 09:36.871
I'm just a woman.

09:36.940 --> 09:40.793
I remember one... like,
th-the music, the everything,

09:40.847 --> 09:43.797
but I... one of the most i-is the...

09:44.024 --> 09:45.527
when you had to hear something.

09:45.579 --> 09:46.832
Okay, that's a funny bit.

09:46.857 --> 09:48.249
- Oh, my God, the hair thing.
- That's a funny thing.

09:48.318 --> 09:50.118
The hair flip, right?

09:50.187 --> 09:52.454
[beeping]

09:52.522 --> 09:56.324
That was so weird because
it's very strange feeling

09:56.393 --> 10:00.327
as an actress you really
learn to sense the camera,

10:00.352 --> 10:01.867
so when they would do
the push-in on my ear

10:01.892 --> 10:02.997
it was... felt creepy.

10:03.066 --> 10:05.433
It was, like, "Get out of
there. That's private," you know?

10:05.502 --> 10:09.448
It was really strange, and so
after a while I kept saying,

10:09.473 --> 10:11.321
"First of all, if I can
hear through that wall,

10:11.353 --> 10:12.407
why can't I hear through my hair?"

10:12.476 --> 10:13.575

after about three episodes,

10:17.428 --> 10:18.243

10:18.268 --> 10:20.358
and if you look, you'll
see it's the same ear.

10:20.383 --> 10:22.433
Through... for three years,
you get to see the same ear.

10:22.465 --> 10:23.677
They're, "Oh, we'll get
her one way or the other."

18:27.841 --> 18:30.907
"Jem and the Holograms" was
a cartoon show in the '80s

18:30.962 --> 18:33.842
at the time when all of
the toys that came out

18:33.889 --> 18:36.020
were linked to shows that were going on.

18:36.045 --> 18:39.032
Jem was the truly
outrageous star of the show

18:39.094 --> 18:41.963
and she was a rock star by night.

18:41.988 --> 18:43.159
I rocked out to a little Jem.

18:43.184 --> 18:45.610
I'm not afraid to admit that.
I'm not afraid to admit that.

18:45.658 --> 18:49.060
And she was a foster mom of, you know,

18:49.095 --> 18:50.595
kind of wayward girls during the day.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.289
Yeah, well, you're
being modest about Jem.

18:52.383 --> 18:54.958
- Like, this cartoon was huge.
- It was huge.

18:55.060 --> 18:58.636
There was nothing in the
'80s that looked like this.

18:58.671 --> 19:02.273
It's very MTV-like when MTV
was really cool back then.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.823
They would intercut,
uh, videos in between

19:04.848 --> 19:06.210
some of the cartoon scenes.

19:06.246 --> 19:08.780
They did mu... they did
cartoon music videos.

19:08.815 --> 19:12.283
And if you really want
to go back and see, like,

19:12.308 --> 19:15.951
the '80s through a prism removed, like,

19:15.976 --> 19:17.727
by Korean animators.

19:17.759 --> 19:18.890
[laughter]

19:18.925 --> 19:21.592
It's... you have to
watch some "Jem," man.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.287
Yeah, no, I'm looking at
this bright colorful...

19:24.312 --> 19:25.229
Mm-hmm.

19:25.265 --> 19:27.592
Um, I'm going to say this had
an influence on your own life?

19:27.638 --> 19:29.767
I have my Jem tattoo.

19:29.810 --> 19:32.648
It's definitely something
that influenced me style-wise.

19:32.719 --> 19:35.225
I became a makeup
artist because they had

19:35.250 --> 19:37.988
all of this crazy makeup and
I would get in my mom's stuff

19:38.013 --> 19:39.920
and paint on my face and, you know,

19:39.945 --> 19:41.781
flip the tape over to
the instrumental side

19:41.852 --> 19:44.348
and pretend I was Jem
and sing in my room.

19:44.384 --> 19:45.983
Is that how it went for you as well?

19:46.019 --> 19:47.776
I was in my room, like, you know...

19:47.801 --> 19:49.847
I guarantee Jem was
too outrageous for him

19:49.872 --> 19:51.516
so he... he's like,
"I'll be the foster mom."

19:51.579 --> 19:53.388
[laughter]

19:53.413 --> 19:54.913
So are you looking to sell these today?

19:54.938 --> 19:57.820
Yeah. I actually, um,
have doubles of these

19:57.867 --> 20:02.047
and there are new Jem dolls
that were re-done recently

20:02.141 --> 20:03.746
that came out that are beautiful.

20:03.778 --> 20:06.062
They are absolutely gorgeous.
The costumes are amazing.

20:06.093 --> 20:10.185
However, they all start
at about $120, so that's...

20:10.210 --> 20:11.509
- Oh, really.
- So that's... yeah.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.711
Mm.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.480
All right, what are you
looking to get for it?

20:15.515 --> 20:17.608
I was looking at $140 for the pair.

20:17.655 --> 20:19.168
$140?

20:20.687 --> 20:21.786
How about $100?

20:21.821 --> 20:24.155
Eeehh,

20:24.190 --> 20:28.993
Could you come up a little
from $100, at least $120?

20:29.028 --> 20:30.795
All right, $120.

20:31.094 --> 20:33.746
$120 it is.

20:33.771 --> 20:34.703
All right.

20:34.728 --> 20:37.492
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.

20:37.875 --> 20:39.078
- Thank you.
- Amazing.

20:39.102 --> 20:41.037
- Thank you, guys.
- Rock on, my friend.

20:41.062 --> 20:42.044

20:42.068 --> 20:44.721
Oh, man, just like a comic book we love,

20:44.745 --> 20:47.915
it's time to close this episode
and put it back on the shelf.

20:52.733 --> 20:54.725
Remember, kids, nothing's really broke

20:54.749 --> 20:56.194
if you can rebuild it.

20:56.218 --> 20:58.218
And you have the technology.

20:58.242 --> 21:01.687
You can make it better,
stronger, faster.

21:01.711 --> 21:02.765
