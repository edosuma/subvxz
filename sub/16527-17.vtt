WEBVTT

00:02.294 --> 00:04.796
(shopping cart rattling)

00:08.667 --> 00:10.469
(baby babbling)

00:10.469 --> 00:12.738
<i>¿Ah, que pasa,</i>
<i>mijo?</i>

00:12.738 --> 00:15.207
(baby babbling)

00:36.762 --> 00:37.963
(baby crying)

00:40.499 --> 00:42.234
(gunshot)

00:43.035 --> 00:44.836
(tires squealing)

00:48.974 --> 00:52.911
(foot step on
ground, man sighs)

00:52.911 --> 00:54.913
(sighs)
And where are you headed?

00:56.381 --> 00:58.583
Thought I'd head
down to the spa.

00:58.583 --> 01:00.585
Maybe get me one of
those seaweed wraps.

01:00.585 --> 01:02.521
You're going to work.

01:02.521 --> 01:04.022
Idea had crossed my mind.

01:04.022 --> 01:05.457
Mm‐hmm.
(sighs)

01:05.457 --> 01:07.025
You want breakfast
or something first?

01:07.025 --> 01:08.593
We could order room service.

01:08.593 --> 01:10.395
Oh, I'm sorry.
Does that make you nervous?

01:10.395 --> 01:11.997
Is it too much
like a real date?

01:11.997 --> 01:14.533
Only thing that makes me nervous
is the prices in that menu.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.468
It's $36 for some
scrambled eggs.

01:16.468 --> 01:17.869
We'd have to
rob a bank.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.738
I mean, I could
be into that.

01:19.738 --> 01:22.207
(phone ringing)

01:23.942 --> 01:25.811
Secret phone.

01:25.811 --> 01:27.012
Keeping the mystery
alive, huh?

01:27.012 --> 01:29.414
Well, it's just the other guy
I have stashed across town

01:29.414 --> 01:30.549
at the Four Seasons.

01:30.549 --> 01:31.950
Uh‐huh.
Palmer.

01:32.951 --> 01:35.353
Yeah, uh, I will be down
in five minutes.

01:35.353 --> 01:36.288
(Riggs groans)

01:36.288 --> 01:39.491
Okay, and bad news‐‐
my day off is cancelled.

01:39.491 --> 01:42.060
Oh, just when I was getting
excited about robbing that bank.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.395
Oh, were you?
Uh‐huh.

01:43.395 --> 01:44.696
I got a new plan.
Mm.

01:44.696 --> 01:46.064
I'm going to keep the room.

01:46.064 --> 01:49.367
We are going to go to work,
do the crime solving,

01:49.367 --> 01:51.837
and then you're going to meet me
right back here later tonight.

01:51.837 --> 01:53.371
It's a date.

01:53.371 --> 01:55.440
No, it's not,
but it's much closer.

01:55.440 --> 01:56.708
Mm.

01:56.708 --> 01:59.845
(door opens, closes)

01:59.845 --> 02:01.780
(bell dings)

02:15.026 --> 02:17.596
(birds singing)

02:17.596 --> 02:19.364
"Guillermo Azoulay."

02:19.364 --> 02:21.399
Is that a made‐up name?

02:21.399 --> 02:23.401
TRISH:
I assure you it is not.

02:25.370 --> 02:27.939
VIP tickets to Coachella?!

02:27.939 --> 02:29.374
Are you kidding me?!

02:29.374 --> 02:30.375
Who is this guy?

02:30.375 --> 02:32.477
The biggest client at
your mama's former firm.

02:32.477 --> 02:33.612
Not anymore.

02:33.612 --> 02:35.046
I just got off
the phone with him,

02:35.046 --> 02:37.816
and he fired the firm
because I left.

02:37.816 --> 02:39.050
What?

02:39.050 --> 02:40.051
Dad, you're
gonna die.

02:40.051 --> 02:43.421
Two dozen Wagyu Kobe Ribeye.

02:43.421 --> 02:45.357
That's the meat of kings.

02:45.357 --> 02:47.058
It's‐it's like he can
read my heart.

02:47.058 --> 02:48.493
(laughs)

02:48.493 --> 02:50.362
What does he want?
What? What?

02:50.362 --> 02:51.830
He offered me a job,

02:51.830 --> 02:54.032
and he wants you
to convince me to take it.
Sold.

02:54.032 --> 02:56.635
Mission accomplished,
Mr. Azoulay.

02:56.635 --> 02:58.837
And he is rerouting
his private jet...

02:58.837 --> 03:01.239
He has a private jet?
He has a private jet?

03:01.239 --> 03:04.776
Yes, he has a private jet, and
he is rerouting it to Van Nuys

03:04.776 --> 03:07.479
just in <i>case</i> I can
meet him this morning.

03:07.479 --> 03:10.348
Okay. Let us recap here.

03:10.348 --> 03:13.585
He runs a billion‐dollar empire,

03:13.585 --> 03:17.455
he fired the law firm because
they did not appreciate you,

03:17.455 --> 03:19.858
and he's rerouting his

03:19.858 --> 03:22.794
private jet for you?

03:24.362 --> 03:25.931
I'm thinking
I should meet the man.

03:25.931 --> 03:27.532
Maybe you should meet
with the man.
MURTAUGH: Okay.

03:27.532 --> 03:29.034
My work is done here.

03:29.034 --> 03:30.602
Roger out.

03:30.602 --> 03:34.739
(whistling)

03:34.739 --> 03:37.475
Hey, hey, Big Rog,
you got a minute?

03:37.475 --> 03:39.344
We really need to talk
about your palm tree.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.479
Sorry, don't got no minutes.

03:41.479 --> 03:43.348
Maybe you haven't
noticed, but the tree‐‐

03:43.348 --> 03:45.483
it's dropping palm fruit,
the little berries,

03:45.483 --> 03:49.354
all over my brand new
purchase‐‐ a fully‐restored...

03:54.559 --> 03:59.397
1966 Mustang... convertible?

03:59.397 --> 04:01.700
I totally forgot.

04:01.700 --> 04:04.236
You're a big fan
of the old Mustangs, right?

04:04.236 --> 04:06.338
(laughs)
Me?

04:06.338 --> 04:08.773
Nah, it's‐it's just a car.

04:08.773 --> 04:10.508
(laughs)

04:10.508 --> 04:11.843
Just a car?

04:11.843 --> 04:13.578
Or a work of art.

04:13.578 --> 04:15.780
That is the
K‐code 289.

04:15.780 --> 04:18.250
They made less than 600
of these babies.

04:19.918 --> 04:21.353
Yeah, well, I got to go.

04:21.353 --> 04:23.488
Hey.

04:23.488 --> 04:25.323
You gonna do something
about the tree?

04:26.791 --> 04:28.593
The berries, Rog‐‐ they stain.

04:28.593 --> 04:30.729
Don't look at them as stains.

04:30.729 --> 04:34.366
Look at them as little,
tiny works of art!

04:34.366 --> 04:35.934
(engine revs, tires squealing)

04:38.270 --> 04:41.273
(indistinct, quiet chatter)

04:46.945 --> 04:50.282
1966 cherry red

04:50.282 --> 04:52.884
Mustang convertible,
limited edition.

04:52.884 --> 04:55.420
Oh, like the one
you got on your screensaver?

04:55.420 --> 04:58.490
Yeah, except now, it's sitting
in McNeile's driveway.

04:58.490 --> 05:01.459
I think he got that car
just to drive me crazy.

05:01.459 --> 05:03.361
I got to look
at it every day!

05:03.361 --> 05:05.630
Or you <i>get</i> to look
at it every day, Rog.

05:05.630 --> 05:06.865
See, that's your problem.

05:06.865 --> 05:08.900
You're always
a glass‐half‐empty kind of guy.

05:08.900 --> 05:10.702
Oh, <i>I'm</i> the half‐empty guy?

05:10.702 --> 05:12.737
That's some mighty rich words
coming from your mouth.

05:12.737 --> 05:14.239
Did you have
a nice walk?

05:14.239 --> 05:15.440
We did.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.509
Hey, Bailey,

05:17.509 --> 05:20.011
which one of us is more
of a half‐empty kind of guy?

05:20.011 --> 05:22.714
Do not put her
on the spot like that.

05:22.714 --> 05:24.249
You're just gonna get
your feelings hurt,

05:24.249 --> 05:26.451
and then we all have
to deal with you pouty.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.486
You guys want to hear
about the body or what?

05:28.486 --> 05:30.722
Yes, we would love
to hear about the
body. Thank you.

05:30.722 --> 05:34.993
A DWP crew spotted it early
this morning and called it in.

05:34.993 --> 05:36.461
SCORSESE:
Our killer couldn't
even be bothered

05:36.461 --> 05:37.862
to make it look like a suicide.

05:37.862 --> 05:39.931
Hands were bound,
bag over his head.

05:39.931 --> 05:41.933
So, what do you think? He was
hanging there all night?

05:41.933 --> 05:42.934
SCORSESE:
It's hard to say until...

05:42.934 --> 05:44.903
No.

05:44.903 --> 05:46.938
He was alive this morning
at 8:00 a. m.

05:46.938 --> 05:48.039
(camera shutter clicking)

05:48.039 --> 05:50.542
And how would you know that?

05:53.411 --> 05:55.814
'Cause that's when I saw him
talking to Palmer

05:55.814 --> 05:59.050
outside our hotel.

05:59.050 --> 06:01.186
♪ ♪

06:10.762 --> 06:13.631
Are you okay?

06:13.631 --> 06:15.700
(laughs)

06:15.700 --> 06:17.736
No, I'm fine. I'm just...

06:17.736 --> 06:19.904
I think I'm still adjusting
to the whole idea

06:19.904 --> 06:21.773
of a job interview
at 30,000 feet.

06:21.773 --> 06:25.310
And I can't tell you how
much I appreciate that.

06:25.310 --> 06:27.312
The plane will drop me
in Seattle,

06:27.312 --> 06:29.381
turn around, take you back home.

06:29.381 --> 06:31.516
Also, I have
a parachute,

06:31.516 --> 06:33.451
so we don't even have to land.

06:33.451 --> 06:34.719
Oh. (laughs)

06:34.719 --> 06:37.255
That's thoughtful, but...

06:37.255 --> 06:40.191
I think I'm the one who's going
to need the parachute.

06:41.026 --> 06:43.461
When I tell you
I can't take the job.

06:43.461 --> 06:45.263
You've had other offers.

06:45.263 --> 06:46.531
No.

06:46.531 --> 06:49.267
Leaving the firm gave me
a chance to breathe.

06:49.267 --> 06:51.903
Catching up with my life,
my family.

06:51.903 --> 06:53.938
Look, I understand
putting family first.

06:53.938 --> 06:58.376
I bought this plane
to maximize time with my own.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.712
So, before you say no...

07:03.681 --> 07:05.683
Job offer.

07:08.586 --> 07:10.588
(sighs)

07:16.327 --> 07:18.997
There's nothing written here.

07:18.997 --> 07:22.233
Because the offer...
is whatever you want it to be.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.902
Name it.

07:23.902 --> 07:26.304
Salary, benefits,

07:26.304 --> 07:28.506
take whatever time
off you need,

07:28.506 --> 07:30.241
set your own schedule.

07:30.241 --> 07:31.910
You're worth it.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.912
(laughs)

07:36.614 --> 07:38.616
I don't know what to say.

07:40.251 --> 07:42.520
Can I give you
the best piece of advice

07:42.520 --> 07:44.522
my dad ever gave me?

07:46.591 --> 07:49.627
Always err
on the side of saying yes.

07:56.734 --> 07:58.736
RIGGS:
What do we know about him?

07:58.736 --> 08:01.673
His fingerprints peg
him as Carlos Gonzalez.

08:01.673 --> 08:03.808
Does that name mean
anything to you?
Mm‐mm.

08:03.808 --> 08:07.745
Well, database says that he
was a low‐level foot soldier

08:07.745 --> 08:09.881
for Tito Flores
before he disappeared.

08:09.881 --> 08:12.417
Had to be Palmer's informant.

08:12.417 --> 08:13.618
I'm assuming
you called her.

08:13.618 --> 08:14.986
Yeah. Voicemail.

08:14.986 --> 08:16.888
Phone's turned off.

08:16.888 --> 08:18.990
Okay, well, that means nothing.

08:18.990 --> 08:20.992
I mean, you're hard
to reach occasionally.

08:20.992 --> 08:22.994
Mm.
Okay.

08:22.994 --> 08:26.831
Well, let's just swing by her
place and put your mind at ease.

08:26.831 --> 08:30.602
I don't know
where she lives, so...

08:30.602 --> 08:32.770
Right. But what about friends?

08:32.770 --> 08:35.173
You know her friends, of course?

08:36.241 --> 08:39.244
Mm‐hmm, okay, you're just...

08:39.244 --> 08:41.312
You're taking it slow, I guess.

08:41.312 --> 08:43.648
Um...

08:43.648 --> 08:45.517
so, what <i>do</i> you know?

08:45.517 --> 08:47.585
Well, I know where she works,

08:47.585 --> 08:49.754
and they've been dicks
on the phone all day, so...

08:49.754 --> 08:52.924
That means they just need to see
our smiling faces in person.

08:54.926 --> 08:57.262
MAN:
<i>Again,</i>

08:57.262 --> 08:59.731
you're not coming in because
your name's not in the system.

08:59.731 --> 09:01.666
We told you.
The DEA agent

09:01.666 --> 09:03.668
who would put us
into the system...

09:03.668 --> 09:05.537
Is the individual
we're looking for.
Yes.

09:05.537 --> 09:07.539
So if you could just please
pick up your phone

09:07.539 --> 09:09.274
and call upstairs, we could
all go about our day.

09:09.274 --> 09:10.875
I'm not calling anyone
because, as I said...

09:10.875 --> 09:11.776
I swear to God if he says

09:11.776 --> 09:13.311
we're not in the
system one more time...

09:13.311 --> 09:14.445
one more time...
It's okay.

09:14.445 --> 09:15.813
Just cool down.
It's... Look,

09:15.813 --> 09:17.549
could you just tell us,

09:17.549 --> 09:19.884
did Palmer even come
to the office today?

09:19.884 --> 09:21.619
MAN:
No, I can't.
You want to know why?

09:21.619 --> 09:23.888
MURTAUGH:
Now you know I am LAPD, right?

09:23.888 --> 09:26.291
MAN:
No. I know
you're <i>not</i> DEA, which means

09:26.291 --> 09:27.392
you have no
jurisdiction.

09:27.392 --> 09:28.860
(elevator bell dings)
What's up with... these rules?

09:30.295 --> 09:31.296
Where's your partner?

09:31.296 --> 09:32.697
What partner?

09:32.697 --> 09:35.700
I haven't seen Palmer all day,
but that's her desk.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.702
I appreciate it. Thank you.

09:44.242 --> 09:46.244
(sighs)

09:47.845 --> 09:50.748
(computer keys clicking, beeps)

10:13.471 --> 10:15.673
MAN:
Step away from the desk,
Detective.

10:15.673 --> 10:17.375
MURTAUGH:
My bad.

10:17.375 --> 10:18.676
You know what?
I <i>did</i> come with someone.

10:18.676 --> 10:20.478
Detective, you're

10:20.478 --> 10:22.513
trespassing.
Oh, no, no, no. See,

10:22.513 --> 10:24.549
your colleague‐‐ she
fell off the map today,

10:24.549 --> 10:26.351
so I'm doing my job, and yours.

10:26.351 --> 10:28.553
Look, Agent Palmer
took a vacation day.

10:28.553 --> 10:30.054
If she's not calling you back,

10:30.054 --> 10:31.823
maybe it's because
she doesn't want to.

10:31.823 --> 10:34.359
Having just met you,
that makes the most sense to me.

10:34.359 --> 10:35.493
MURTAUGH:
It's okay. It's okay.

10:35.493 --> 10:40.531
Let's calm down.
Everybody take five.

10:40.531 --> 10:42.900
You know what?
You're right, Rog.

10:42.900 --> 10:45.436
We're uninvited
guests in your home.

10:45.436 --> 10:48.306
Please accept our
apologies, Larry,

10:48.306 --> 10:50.642
and, uh, thank you
for your hospitality.

10:51.676 --> 10:52.944
Thanks.

10:52.944 --> 10:54.779
Unexpected tact
and restraint.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.314
I'm impressed, Riggs.

10:56.314 --> 10:57.915
Yeah, we don't need
that jackass.

10:57.915 --> 11:00.385
Palmer changed the locks
on a house in Chatsworth.

11:00.385 --> 11:02.186
Address is on the receipt.

11:04.255 --> 11:06.257
(dog barks nearby)

11:10.895 --> 11:13.731
Not exactly swimming
in curb appeal.

11:13.731 --> 11:16.334
I see why you two
get along.

11:23.908 --> 11:26.811
Palmer?

11:33.751 --> 11:35.820
It's not her place.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.356
It's a safe house.

12:04.716 --> 12:06.484
(phone keypad beeping)

12:06.484 --> 12:08.720
(line rings, phone rings)

12:11.522 --> 12:12.724
Rog.

12:12.724 --> 12:14.792
Palmer was here.

12:14.792 --> 12:16.527
Rog.

12:34.537 --> 12:36.205
...I am trying to,
Detective, so back off.
Oh, now you want to help.

12:36.205 --> 12:38.541
The time to help is when
I came to you this morning,
Look, Palmer went off the grid.

12:38.541 --> 12:39.808
and told you Palmer was missing.
We followed protocol.

12:39.808 --> 12:41.810
Oh, you followed protocol?
Yeah.
Riggs.

12:41.810 --> 12:42.645
The only reason I even knew
there was a crime scene...

12:42.645 --> 12:44.680
Was because you
stole the address

12:44.680 --> 12:45.681
of a DEA safe house.

12:45.681 --> 12:46.448
Enough.

12:46.448 --> 12:49.418
Every resource
is being allocated.

12:49.418 --> 12:51.220
The city attorney's
even on his way in.

12:51.220 --> 12:53.422
Now, the DEA has
information for us.

12:53.422 --> 12:56.158
We can hear it or we can
yell at each other.

12:58.827 --> 13:01.964
Agent Chappel, please continue.

13:03.365 --> 13:07.102
The, uh, autopsy and the
forensics from the safe house

13:07.102 --> 13:08.771
all point to this man.

13:08.771 --> 13:10.406
Gideon Lyon.

13:10.406 --> 13:11.774
He's one of ours.

13:11.774 --> 13:13.642
He's a, uh, part of a CIA group

13:13.642 --> 13:14.710
that was sent to train
the Mexican military

13:14.710 --> 13:16.645
to fight the cartels.

13:16.645 --> 13:19.048
Gideon went full Kurtz.

13:19.048 --> 13:22.117
He sold his services
to Tito Flores.

13:22.117 --> 13:25.821
He is now in charge of the
Flores Cartel's security wing.

13:25.821 --> 13:28.324
Gideon is maybe
the most brutal enforcer

13:28.324 --> 13:30.793
I've come across in 20 years

13:30.793 --> 13:32.561
of fighting drug wars.

13:32.561 --> 13:33.796
His CIA dossier

13:33.796 --> 13:36.265
says he enjoys delivering pain

13:36.265 --> 13:37.800
and excels at it.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.669
We got intel last week

13:40.669 --> 13:42.605
that he had crossed
the border, and...

13:42.605 --> 13:44.673
Wait. What?

13:44.673 --> 13:46.542
Where?
Where did he cross the border?

13:46.542 --> 13:47.710
San Diego.

13:50.312 --> 13:52.314
So you knew this morning
he was in country

13:52.314 --> 13:53.682
when I came in there

13:53.682 --> 13:55.317
and walked in the office
and told you she was missing?

13:55.317 --> 13:57.152
It would've changed nothing.
You don't know that.

13:57.152 --> 13:58.087
Captain, what's
happening here?
Your girlfriend's dead,

13:58.087 --> 14:00.189
Detective. Gideon
killed her before you...

14:00.823 --> 14:03.626
Martin!

14:09.431 --> 14:11.233
DELGADO:
<i>I have a zero tolerance policy</i>

14:11.233 --> 14:13.502
for this kind
of behavior, Captain.
AVERY: I understand.

14:13.502 --> 14:15.170
Give me a break, Ronnie.

14:15.170 --> 14:16.772
Chappel's gonna end up getting
somebody killed.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.240
Was I addressing
you, Detective?

14:18.240 --> 14:19.808
Hand your gun
and your badge

14:19.808 --> 14:22.244
to your captain.
You're suspended.
Ronnie.

14:22.244 --> 14:24.113
Are you serious?

14:24.113 --> 14:26.248
Your badge and your gun.

14:26.248 --> 14:29.652
Ronnie, I am not trying
to replace her.

14:29.652 --> 14:31.120
Okay? Palmer's
not my girlfriend.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.321
Give me some credit.

14:32.321 --> 14:33.789
This has nothing to do
with my daughter.

14:33.789 --> 14:36.292
You assaulted a DEA agent.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.260
You're lucky you're not
in a holding cell.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.537
CAHILL:
Yes, he's here.

14:48.537 --> 14:50.539
I'll call you back.

14:50.539 --> 14:52.341
I heard about what happened.

14:52.341 --> 14:54.143
Yeah. They locked me out of the
database, so if we could...

14:54.143 --> 14:56.278
Riggs.

14:56.278 --> 14:59.181
Palmer's still missing,
all right?

14:59.181 --> 15:01.483
So I just need some information
on this cartel guy, Gideon.

15:01.483 --> 15:03.152
So if you could just
make this thing work...

15:03.152 --> 15:04.620
I can't get you onto
the database.

15:04.620 --> 15:07.790
Okay. So you're useless to me...
perfect.

15:07.790 --> 15:09.491
You know what? I suggest
you take a walk.

15:09.491 --> 15:12.094
Okay? Maybe step outside
the office. Seriously.

15:12.094 --> 15:14.296
Try the parking garage,
maybe Level D.

15:22.371 --> 15:23.772
How's that?

15:23.772 --> 15:26.375
Parking garage, Level D.

15:27.509 --> 15:29.044
Thank you.

15:30.779 --> 15:32.815
Let me guess.

15:32.815 --> 15:35.250
You've been told
not to talk to me.

15:35.250 --> 15:37.786
No, I can talk to you;

15:37.786 --> 15:40.522
however, I am not allowed
to tell you

15:40.522 --> 15:43.125
that Bailey hacked
Palmer's phone.

15:43.125 --> 15:45.260
Or that Carlos Gonzalez

15:45.260 --> 15:47.563
called her from Dana Point
this morning,

15:47.563 --> 15:49.798
which is also where
a cartel gunman

15:49.798 --> 15:52.434
was found shot dead
hours earlier.

15:52.434 --> 15:54.069
Can't tell you that.

15:54.069 --> 15:55.270
Interesting.

15:55.270 --> 15:58.407
Are there any leads you're not
supposed to tell me about?

15:58.407 --> 16:00.676
Yes. I absolutely cannot
tell you that this van

16:00.676 --> 16:02.211
that fled the scene,

16:02.211 --> 16:04.279
was just spotted
in Boyle Heights.

16:04.279 --> 16:06.382
It's information
I can't divulge.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.751
I'm gonna get you in a
lot of trouble, Roger.

16:08.751 --> 16:10.219
Yes, you will.

16:12.121 --> 16:14.089
You didn't happen to, uh,
bring me a bang stick,

16:14.089 --> 16:15.424
by any chance, did you?

16:15.424 --> 16:17.960
Absolutely not.

16:20.696 --> 16:21.830
MURTAUGH:
<i>So, uh...</i>

16:21.830 --> 16:25.567
Avery gave me an interesting
little factoid about you.

16:25.567 --> 16:28.771
Delgado is
Miranda's father.

16:28.771 --> 16:30.773
Not that interesting.

16:30.773 --> 16:34.543
No, what's interesting is
you never told me that.

16:34.543 --> 16:36.245
Yeah, well, you never asked.

16:36.245 --> 16:38.781
Oh, come on. That can't be
your whole answer.

16:38.781 --> 16:40.516
I mean, why would
it occur to me

16:40.516 --> 16:43.152
to even ask you something
like that? "Hey, Riggs,

16:43.152 --> 16:45.254
is the city attorney
your father‐in‐law?"

16:45.254 --> 16:47.189
Rog, you're the detective, okay?

16:47.189 --> 16:48.457
Oh, come on, man.

16:49.558 --> 16:51.660
Fine. Hey Riggs,

16:51.660 --> 16:52.795
is there anyone else
in local government

16:52.795 --> 16:54.263
that's related to you?

16:56.298 --> 16:57.733
Hey, Rog?

16:57.733 --> 16:59.802
Hmm?
If you were a
high‐level cartel enforcer

16:59.802 --> 17:02.337
looking for a, I don't know,
under‐the‐radar

17:02.337 --> 17:04.506
<i>crappy motel to hide...</i>

17:04.506 --> 17:07.109
MURTAUGH:
<i>Hotel manager said</i>

17:07.109 --> 17:09.611
that they only rented
one room today, number 31.

17:09.611 --> 17:11.747
RIGGS: Corner unit,
up high, makes sense.

17:11.747 --> 17:14.082
Mm‐hmm. Hey, look.

17:14.082 --> 17:16.385
We don't know what we're
gonna find up there,

17:16.385 --> 17:18.086
so if you want to
hang back and...

17:18.086 --> 17:19.388
I guess you don't.

17:35.537 --> 17:37.539
(lock beeps)

17:40.776 --> 17:42.244
Please don't hurt him.

17:42.244 --> 17:44.246
Did we get the wrong room?
(gun cocking)

17:47.649 --> 17:49.985
Are you trying to get killed?

17:59.477 --> 18:01.479
Because it's called
"radio silence," not "radio
occasional phone calls."

18:01.479 --> 18:02.546
One call, one call.
Oh, my God.

18:02.546 --> 18:03.814
Okay, listen, listen.

18:03.814 --> 18:06.083
I gave Carlos my phone before
Maria and I left the safe house.

18:06.083 --> 18:07.885
He was supposed
to meet us here.

18:07.885 --> 18:09.887
When I couldn't get a hold of
him, I realized they got him.

18:09.887 --> 18:11.656
I had no idea it
was Gideon himself.

18:11.656 --> 18:14.058
So why is Gideon
going after Maria?

18:14.058 --> 18:16.193
He's not after Maria,
he's after her baby.

18:16.193 --> 18:19.697
That kid is Tito Flores' son.
(baby crying nearby)

18:21.832 --> 18:26.504
MARIA:
I was in a beauty pageant
when I was 19.

18:26.504 --> 18:28.839
I was the runner‐up.

18:28.839 --> 18:30.975
But lucky me,

18:30.975 --> 18:33.678
Tito Flores
was in the audience.

18:33.678 --> 18:35.813
He found me after
and said,

18:35.813 --> 18:38.549
I may have come in second
but I won his heart.

18:38.549 --> 18:39.984
How'd you not laugh in his face?

18:39.984 --> 18:41.852
Because he's Tito Flores
and if you do that

18:41.852 --> 18:43.120
he kills your family.

18:43.120 --> 18:45.823
I wanted to go
to nursing school,

18:45.823 --> 18:49.660
but instead I was Tito's
mistress for four years.

18:49.660 --> 18:51.862
How'd you get away?
(baby fussing)

18:51.862 --> 18:53.664
I got pregnant,

18:53.664 --> 18:57.468
and I couldn't let my baby
grow up in that life.

18:57.468 --> 19:00.604
My cousin, Carlos,
he‐he snuck us out,

19:00.604 --> 19:03.074
brought us here, put me in touch
with the DEA.

19:03.074 --> 19:04.942
It was quiet for months,

19:04.942 --> 19:07.745
and then Tito's men found us.

19:07.745 --> 19:09.880
The Dana Point parking lot.

19:13.884 --> 19:16.087
You did good,
you kept him safe.

19:16.087 --> 19:17.822
The DEA will be here,

19:17.822 --> 19:19.757
and, uh, they're
gonna bring you in.

19:19.757 --> 19:21.759
(phone buzzes)

19:23.627 --> 19:24.895
It's my wife.

19:24.895 --> 19:26.097
She had a big day.

19:26.097 --> 19:27.631
I'm gonna take it outside.

19:30.034 --> 19:31.836
Hey, baby.
Have we got news?

19:31.836 --> 19:34.839
TRISH: Please hold
for Guillermo Azoulay's

19:34.839 --> 19:36.674
new in‐house counsel.

19:36.674 --> 19:39.643
You got the job.
(laughs)

19:39.643 --> 19:41.078
Congratulations.

19:41.078 --> 19:43.080
Hey, we're gonna celebrate
this weekend.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.649
Actually, how would you like
to celebrate tonight?

19:45.649 --> 19:47.051
In Paris.

19:47.051 --> 19:49.787
What? Did the job come with
jet‐packs?

19:49.787 --> 19:52.590
No. Azoulay lent me his plane.

19:52.590 --> 19:55.693
Said we can take it anywhere we
want to for the next two days.

19:55.693 --> 19:57.962
We land in Van Nuys
in half an hour.

19:57.962 --> 20:00.131
Seriously?
We could really do this?

20:00.131 --> 20:03.534
Honey, all you have to do
is get off early.

20:03.534 --> 20:05.836
I‐I think I can swing this.

20:05.836 --> 20:08.472
The DEA's coming to relieve us
any minute.

20:08.472 --> 20:11.675
I can be wheels up
in 45 minutes.

20:11.675 --> 20:13.744
"Wheels up."

20:13.744 --> 20:17.148
Roger Mayfield Murtaugh,
(brakes squeal)

20:17.148 --> 20:20.718
you know what a girl
likes to hear.

20:20.718 --> 20:22.953
Honey...

20:22.953 --> 20:26.757
I might have been a little
optimistic about 45 minutes.

20:26.757 --> 20:28.025
I've got to run,
I'll call you back later.

20:31.028 --> 20:33.631
Guys.

20:33.631 --> 20:36.634
We have a rocket launcher
situation out here.

20:37.868 --> 20:39.003
MARIA:
How did he find us?

20:39.003 --> 20:40.771
RIGGS:
All right, look.

20:40.771 --> 20:42.173
If Tito sent this guy
to get the kid,

20:42.173 --> 20:43.974
he's not gonna fire that thing
in here.

20:43.974 --> 20:47.011
So we've got time.
He will. He'll have orders
to kill Roberto

20:47.011 --> 20:48.979
if he can't bring him back.
Who knew where you were going?

20:48.979 --> 20:51.282
What? You think we led him here?
You think you didn't?

20:51.282 --> 20:53.050
Hey, hey. Let's
debate later, okay?

20:53.050 --> 20:54.985
Right now we got to figure out
another exit out of here.

20:54.985 --> 20:58.589
(phone ringing)

21:04.662 --> 21:05.729
Hello.

21:05.729 --> 21:07.932
GIDEON: You have 60 seconds
to give me the child

21:07.932 --> 21:09.467
or everyone dies.

21:09.467 --> 21:11.001
Is this housekeeping?

21:11.001 --> 21:13.571
We have been trying to reach
you guys all day.

21:13.571 --> 21:15.840
We need towels up in room 31.

21:15.840 --> 21:17.007
Could you send some up, please?

21:19.577 --> 21:20.744
Okay. We're out of time,
we've got to go.

21:23.114 --> 21:25.483
Who am I speaking to?

21:25.483 --> 21:27.151
Oh, and I am so confused about
the towel policy. I'm just...

21:27.151 --> 21:29.019
You don't sound like DEA.

21:29.019 --> 21:30.888
Local police, maybe?

21:32.256 --> 21:34.024
RIGGS: So here's my thing,

21:34.024 --> 21:37.161
so if I‐‐ if the towels
I want to keep,

21:37.161 --> 21:38.996
I hang up, and the towels

21:38.996 --> 21:41.499
that I, what? That‐that you guys
are supposed to take to wash,

21:41.499 --> 21:42.967
those towels I hang up?

21:42.967 --> 21:45.102
I don't‐‐ I‐I'm just confused
at which towels to hang up.

21:45.102 --> 21:46.270
30 seconds, policeman.

21:46.270 --> 21:47.338
RIGGS: And also, which ones
do I actually get to keep?

21:47.338 --> 21:50.040
Do I get to take them home?
How does that work?

21:53.844 --> 21:55.646
Hey, I got a tip for you.

21:55.646 --> 21:57.648
Try to die
in the initial explosion.

21:57.648 --> 21:58.983
Don't linger.

21:58.983 --> 22:00.885
Not paying you enough
to be burned alive.

22:00.885 --> 22:03.554
Hey, Gideon,
when you love what you do,

22:03.554 --> 22:05.389
you do it for free, right?

22:08.859 --> 22:10.461
(gunfire)

22:27.478 --> 22:28.479
You good?

22:28.479 --> 22:29.713
Yeah. <i>You</i> good?

22:29.713 --> 22:31.815
(gunfire)

22:37.988 --> 22:39.156
(grunts)

22:45.629 --> 22:46.964
Run. Run.

22:48.999 --> 22:51.502
(whooshing)

22:52.770 --> 22:55.506
(boom)

22:55.506 --> 22:57.775
(phone rings)

22:57.775 --> 23:00.511
MURTAUGH:
Hey, Captain. Pretend I'm Todd.

23:00.511 --> 23:02.713
Hi, Todd. Honey.

23:02.713 --> 23:04.114
I'm kinda busy right now,

23:04.114 --> 23:06.083
but it's <i>really</i> good
to hear your voice.

23:06.083 --> 23:07.785
What's going on?
(whispering): It's Todd.

23:07.785 --> 23:10.221
It's Todd.

23:10.221 --> 23:11.855
MURTAUGH:
<i>Gideon Lyon</i>

23:11.855 --> 23:13.457
just blew up
a damn motel, okay?

23:13.457 --> 23:15.125
We have Tito's kid
and the mother.

23:15.125 --> 23:17.228
We're safe, but somebody
knew where we were.

23:17.228 --> 23:19.463
We have a big‐ass leak.

23:21.799 --> 23:24.068
(sirens wailing)

23:24.068 --> 23:25.736
(tires screech)

23:25.736 --> 23:26.737
(siren stops)

23:26.737 --> 23:28.872
Hands on your head! Now!

23:28.872 --> 23:31.108
Easy, Officer.
Everything's under control.

23:31.108 --> 23:32.543
Put the weapon down!

23:32.543 --> 23:33.444
I'm a contractor.

23:33.444 --> 23:35.212
This was a scheduled demolition.
Shut up

23:35.212 --> 23:36.480
and get on the ground!

23:36.480 --> 23:37.481
I have my permit right here.

23:37.481 --> 23:38.549
(gunshots)

23:47.337 --> 23:49.906
Sorry the place is a mess.

23:49.906 --> 23:51.308
The cleaning service
that I hired,

23:51.308 --> 23:52.909
they're just...
they're terrible.

23:52.909 --> 23:55.445
You know, they don't show up
when they're supposed to.

23:55.445 --> 23:57.347
Well, it's actually a lot better
than I thought it would be.

23:57.347 --> 23:59.449
Although I had you
pegged correctly.

23:59.449 --> 24:02.252
A man that owns more guns
than dishes.

24:04.254 --> 24:05.722
Well...

24:05.722 --> 24:07.724
(grunts)

24:07.724 --> 24:09.726
...my theory's always been,

24:09.726 --> 24:11.261
how many dishes
does a guy really need?

24:11.261 --> 24:13.263
Right?

24:15.265 --> 24:17.400
So, for today's festivities,

24:17.400 --> 24:20.036
you know, I was thinking
of going with, like, a long gun.

24:20.036 --> 24:23.273
So would you go
with the Compressor

24:23.273 --> 24:25.141
or the M40?

24:25.141 --> 24:27.143
That is not even a question.
The .308.

24:27.143 --> 24:28.745
That's just me though.

24:28.745 --> 24:30.747
Although if you don't have
a zero stop on your optics,

24:30.747 --> 24:32.616
honey, what's the point?

24:36.019 --> 24:39.756
I'm sorry, are you suggesting
that I have outdated optics?

24:39.756 --> 24:41.358
Prove me wrong.

24:45.428 --> 24:47.797
Around here somewhere...

24:47.797 --> 24:49.232
(clattering, clanging)

24:58.441 --> 25:00.210
Is that your wife?

25:00.210 --> 25:02.112
Yeah.

25:06.116 --> 25:08.585
Told you.

25:13.390 --> 25:15.592
(crying)

25:17.127 --> 25:19.396
He's too excited
to sleep.

25:19.396 --> 25:21.398
Happens every time we move.

25:21.398 --> 25:23.767
I got something
for that.

25:23.767 --> 25:27.871
This is a lifesaver right here.

25:27.871 --> 25:29.906
Puts Harper
right to sleep.

25:29.906 --> 25:32.142
(soft lullaby playing)

25:32.142 --> 25:36.012
It's like, uh,
baby Ambien.

25:39.749 --> 25:43.286
Roberto had all this and more
before I took him away.

25:43.286 --> 25:46.289
He never even got
to make a choice.

25:46.289 --> 25:49.292
He's not supposed to.

25:49.292 --> 25:51.428
We make choices for them.

25:51.428 --> 25:53.430
That's the gig.

25:53.430 --> 25:55.765
What if I was wrong

25:55.765 --> 25:58.101
and all I've done
is turn him into a target?

25:59.803 --> 26:02.105
I almost got him killed today.

26:02.105 --> 26:04.975
The man Tito sent
will never stop looking for us.

26:04.975 --> 26:07.978
Yeah, well,
that's why we're gonna stop him.

26:07.978 --> 26:08.979
How?

26:08.979 --> 26:10.981
Riggs and Palmer
have a plan.

26:10.981 --> 26:11.948
I don't know all the details,

26:11.948 --> 26:15.719
but Riggs assures me
that I'm gonna love it.

26:16.720 --> 26:17.988
(siren wailing in distance)

26:17.988 --> 26:19.856
So, uh,

26:19.856 --> 26:22.859
I'm starting to feel like
this is not such a great plan.

26:22.859 --> 26:26.129
All the best plans feel
like that, Rog.

26:26.129 --> 26:28.264
That's how you know
it's a great plan.

26:28.264 --> 26:29.933
I'm not sure that's true.

26:29.933 --> 26:32.402
(phone ringing)

26:32.402 --> 26:34.904
Hello?
Hey, baby, I just landed
at Van Nuys.

26:34.904 --> 26:36.773
Where are you?

26:36.773 --> 26:39.743
Oh, you know,
holding a fake baby,

26:39.743 --> 26:40.810
sitting in
a deserted parking lot,

26:40.810 --> 26:43.747
waiting on some cartel guys
to come shoot at me.

26:43.747 --> 26:44.848
Roger,

26:44.848 --> 26:48.018
is it possible I misunderstood
any of those words?

26:48.018 --> 26:50.020
RIGGS: Come on, Rog,
don't worry the woman.

26:50.020 --> 26:51.287
Tell her you're wearing a vest.

26:51.287 --> 26:52.756
Riggs said to tell you

26:52.756 --> 26:54.891
that I'm wearing
a bulletproof vest.

26:54.891 --> 26:57.193
Oh, that's great. What
if they shoot you in the head?

26:57.193 --> 27:00.463
Hey, Riggs, what
if they shoot me in the head?

27:00.463 --> 27:02.866
I mean, do you...
do you want to wear a helmet?

27:02.866 --> 27:05.101
I mean, seems like it'd be
a little obvious, Rog, you know?

27:05.101 --> 27:07.137
Riggs said the helmet
would be obvious.

27:07.137 --> 27:09.139
I'm not sure I agree with that.

27:09.139 --> 27:12.042
Roger, the plane is refueling.

27:12.042 --> 27:14.044
We won't make it to Paris
by dinner.

27:14.044 --> 27:17.147
But if we leave
in the next hour,

27:17.147 --> 27:20.717
we can wake up on
the Champs‐Elysées by breakfast.

27:20.717 --> 27:22.118
Huh? How does that sound?

27:22.118 --> 27:24.120
That sounds amazing.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.989
But I, uh...

27:25.989 --> 27:27.724
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

27:27.724 --> 27:30.060
Okay.

27:30.060 --> 27:31.995
I get it.
(exhales)

27:31.995 --> 27:33.263
It was a pipe dream.

27:33.263 --> 27:35.398
I mean,
who can just drop everything,

27:35.398 --> 27:37.133
right, and fly to Paris?

27:37.133 --> 27:38.768
That's not our life, right?

27:38.768 --> 27:41.404
I wish it was.

27:41.404 --> 27:43.907
Riggs,

27:43.907 --> 27:45.742
I know you can hear me.

27:45.742 --> 27:49.879
I will understand
my husband being late,

27:49.879 --> 27:53.750
but I will not accept
a late husband.

27:54.784 --> 27:56.886
Yes, ma'am.

28:00.290 --> 28:01.825
Hey, Riggs,

28:01.825 --> 28:03.993
next time,
why don't you be in the field

28:03.993 --> 28:05.829
and let me be up
in the cheap seats?

28:05.829 --> 28:07.230
Oh, come on, Rog.

28:07.230 --> 28:09.866
You're gonna be fine.
You're bulletproof.

28:09.866 --> 28:11.868
Mm, I don't feel bulletproof.

28:11.868 --> 28:13.837
You got to believe
you're bulletproof.

28:13.837 --> 28:16.372
That's what makes you
bulletproof.

28:16.372 --> 28:19.242
Again, that is
dangerously not true.

28:19.242 --> 28:20.744
Hey, Rog,

28:20.744 --> 28:23.880
take a deep breath.

28:23.880 --> 28:25.849
Bad guys approaching.

28:25.849 --> 28:26.883
(engine revving)

28:26.883 --> 28:30.053
I gave up Paris for this?

28:30.053 --> 28:31.654
Stupid.

28:33.289 --> 28:36.259
All right, shoot 'em.

28:36.259 --> 28:39.262
Not yet. Just a little closer.
They're close enough.

28:39.262 --> 28:40.130
Shoot 'em.

28:41.397 --> 28:42.599
Three...

28:43.733 --> 28:44.734
...two...

28:45.735 --> 28:47.670
(tires screech)

28:55.011 --> 28:57.013
What's going on?

28:57.013 --> 28:58.414
Why are they turning around?

28:58.414 --> 28:59.883
(tires screech)

29:05.355 --> 29:07.724
Somehow they know
you don't have the baby.

29:07.724 --> 29:10.560
Well, how the hell
did they know that?

29:12.729 --> 29:15.698
(phone ringing)

29:16.699 --> 29:17.967
Don't answer that.

29:20.103 --> 29:21.271
Maria, what are you doing?

29:21.271 --> 29:24.240
I can't make him live
like this anymore.

29:24.240 --> 29:25.375
I called Tito.

29:25.375 --> 29:26.976
I made arrangements.

29:26.976 --> 29:29.012
I'm giving Roberto back to him.

29:29.012 --> 29:31.114
Maria, honey, you're making
a really big mistake.

29:31.114 --> 29:33.249
My baby deserves a chance.

29:34.984 --> 29:35.985
Turn around.

29:35.985 --> 29:37.420
Maria...

29:37.420 --> 29:38.588
Turn around.

29:41.257 --> 29:42.425
I'm sorry.

29:42.425 --> 29:43.126
(grunts)

29:50.032 --> 29:51.300
(phone ringing)

29:51.300 --> 29:52.568
Your house.

29:52.568 --> 29:53.669
Yeah.

29:53.669 --> 29:54.670
I need you need to find
my phone. The burner phone.

29:54.670 --> 29:57.439
Maria's on her way
to take the baby to Tito.

29:57.439 --> 29:58.607
Wait a minute, what...
how did that happen?

29:58.607 --> 30:00.042
She sandbagged me, okay?

30:00.042 --> 30:01.610
Just leave it at that.

30:01.610 --> 30:03.078
But I need you to find my phone.

30:03.078 --> 30:04.313
And she took the van, too.

30:04.313 --> 30:05.914
So I don't have a car.
Can you...

30:05.914 --> 30:07.583
Track the phone, find Maria.
On it.

30:07.583 --> 30:08.984
Hey, Palmer.

30:08.984 --> 30:10.185
What?

30:10.185 --> 30:11.353
You okay?

30:11.353 --> 30:13.589
Well, I've been better.

30:13.589 --> 30:15.224
Go find Maria.

30:15.224 --> 30:17.059
(beeps)

30:20.329 --> 30:21.597
(siren wailing in distance)

30:21.597 --> 30:23.198
I tracked Palmer's phone.

30:23.198 --> 30:25.200
Maria's heading
for the convention center.

30:25.200 --> 30:28.337
Todd, speaking
of modern urban architecture,

30:28.337 --> 30:31.206
you should check out
the convention center.

30:31.206 --> 30:33.475
Yes, the L. A. Convention Center.

30:33.475 --> 30:35.344
Okay.
(beeps)

30:35.344 --> 30:37.946
Okay, I know that wasn't Todd,
and I'm the only one in here.

30:37.946 --> 30:39.348
So who are you performing for?

30:39.348 --> 30:41.950
I think I just like doing it.

30:41.950 --> 30:44.653
Okay, that's weird,
but whatever.

30:44.653 --> 30:46.221
Well, you might want
to call Todd back,

30:46.221 --> 30:47.956
because that info
you asked for...

30:47.956 --> 30:49.358
Outgoing calls
from our bullpen?

30:49.358 --> 30:51.093
I noticed
two curious international calls

30:51.093 --> 30:52.628
from one particular extension.

30:52.628 --> 30:55.230
We have a leak,
don't we, Captain?

30:55.230 --> 30:57.099
Which extension?

30:58.634 --> 31:00.002
What the hell
is your problem?

31:00.002 --> 31:00.969
Who have you been talking to?

31:00.969 --> 31:02.571
Your idiots lost our asset.

31:02.571 --> 31:04.339
I'm trying to coordinate
a response.

31:04.339 --> 31:06.442
By calling Tito's people
and sharing every move we make?

31:07.609 --> 31:09.178
I don't have time for this crap.

31:09.178 --> 31:10.179
(groans)
Take his gun

31:10.179 --> 31:11.246
and cuff him.

31:12.314 --> 31:14.183
(handcuffs clacking)

31:16.185 --> 31:17.519
(indistinct chatter)

31:17.519 --> 31:19.588
ANNOUNCER: Welcome
to the United States citizenship

31:19.588 --> 31:20.956
and naturalization ceremony.

31:20.956 --> 31:21.990
Once you have checked in,

31:21.990 --> 31:24.193
we invite you to take
a seat in Row B.
(crying)

31:24.193 --> 31:26.128
(announcer speaking in Spanish)

31:34.103 --> 31:36.939
Found her.

31:48.083 --> 31:50.352
I was supposed to meet Gideon.

31:50.352 --> 31:51.353
Don't worry.

31:51.353 --> 31:52.488
He's watching.

31:52.488 --> 31:55.090
<i>Hola, Roberto.</i>
(fussing)

31:55.090 --> 31:56.625
Your dad misses you.

31:56.625 --> 31:59.094
Hey, wait, Rog.

31:59.094 --> 32:00.963
Gideon's here.

32:00.963 --> 32:02.297
Up high.

32:02.297 --> 32:03.432
How do you know that?

32:03.432 --> 32:04.433
'Cause that's where I'd be,

32:04.433 --> 32:05.434
with a sniper rifle.

32:05.434 --> 32:07.169
If anything happens to him...

32:07.169 --> 32:09.171
He's got nothing to worry about.

32:09.171 --> 32:10.572
You, on the other hand,

32:10.572 --> 32:12.608
Tito's got a
message for you.

32:12.608 --> 32:14.443
You're not getting
out of here alive.

32:18.580 --> 32:20.849
(speaking inaudibly)

32:23.585 --> 32:24.586
MURTAUGH:
We're out of time, Riggs.

32:24.586 --> 32:26.188
They're about to kill her.

32:26.188 --> 32:28.190
Rog...

32:28.190 --> 32:29.324
I feel bulletproof.

32:32.594 --> 32:34.930
(indistinct shouting)

32:58.086 --> 32:59.421

33:02.558 --> 33:04.026
My baby!

33:09.298 --> 33:11.466

33:20.309 --> 33:22.044

33:23.579 --> 33:25.247
It's okay.
We got him.

33:57.084 --> 33:58.457
So, what?
That's just, uh, your thing?

33:58.457 --> 33:59.692
You just run over
bad guys?

33:59.692 --> 34:01.193
You go with what works.

34:01.193 --> 34:02.227
Yeah?

34:09.217 --> 34:10.685
(baby coos)

34:10.685 --> 34:12.086
You ready?

34:13.955 --> 34:16.591
I know I owe you
both an apology.

34:16.591 --> 34:17.659
I can't tell you

34:17.659 --> 34:20.261
how sorry I am for almost
messing everything up.

34:20.261 --> 34:23.231
Apology accepted. I understand
why you did what you did.

34:23.231 --> 34:25.566
And it all worked
out‐‐ good guys won.

34:25.566 --> 34:27.235
That's right, especially
that little guy right here.

34:27.235 --> 34:28.970
(cooing)

34:35.243 --> 34:38.112
I know I'll always be
looking over my shoulder

34:38.112 --> 34:40.715
for the next person
Tito sends for him, but

34:40.715 --> 34:42.717
you were right.

34:42.717 --> 34:44.018
That's the job.

34:44.018 --> 34:45.586
And you're very good at it.

34:45.586 --> 34:46.854
Remember that.

34:49.123 --> 34:50.992
(engine starting)

34:58.599 --> 35:02.136
Seriously, honest truth,
you know anything about this?

35:02.136 --> 35:04.706
Nope, not a thing.

35:04.706 --> 35:06.074
But look at it this way.

35:06.074 --> 35:08.810
There's only 600 of those
in the whole wide world.

35:08.810 --> 35:11.212
But how many of them
look like that?

35:11.212 --> 35:15.116
That, my friend,
is a work of art.

35:18.686 --> 35:20.822
AVERY:
<i>Pretty amazing</i>

35:20.822 --> 35:24.726
how Murtaugh was able to
single‐handedly take down Gideon

35:24.726 --> 35:26.561
and two gunmen
all by himself.

35:26.561 --> 35:28.629
Yeah. I'm really proud of him.

35:28.629 --> 35:30.698
You know, he's come a long way.

35:30.698 --> 35:32.100
I heard he had
a little help from Palmer.

35:32.100 --> 35:33.634
I mean, that's what
I hear, you know?

35:33.634 --> 35:34.836
Just... just Palmer?

35:34.836 --> 35:36.971
Well, I mean, who else?
I was suspended,

35:36.971 --> 35:38.873
so, therefore, I didn't
have a weapon, and I mean,

35:38.873 --> 35:40.708
where would I find a gun?

35:40.708 --> 35:42.844
Yeah, I'm not‐not buying that
at all.

35:42.844 --> 35:44.112
Hmm.

35:44.112 --> 35:45.847
Really. Um, but
I will accept it,

35:45.847 --> 35:47.982
because Gideon is in custody,
and our leak is plugged.

35:47.982 --> 35:49.984
(sighs)

35:49.984 --> 35:52.987
Now, the city attorney would
like to have a word with you,

35:52.987 --> 35:56.124
so I will give
you the office.

35:56.124 --> 35:58.860
Please try not to
break anything?

36:01.262 --> 36:02.296
Great.

36:02.296 --> 36:03.664
Thank you.

36:06.934 --> 36:08.936
It wasn't personal.

36:08.936 --> 36:10.671
It was policy.

recognized her,

40:40.608 --> 40:43.144

41:05.833 --> 41:07.835
In a DEA file.

41:08.836 --> 41:11.105
Ten months ago, uh,

41:11.105 --> 41:13.641
Mexican police
raided the house

41:13.641 --> 41:15.576
of a known cartel
hit man in Juarez,

41:15.576 --> 41:18.579
and it was Gideon Lyon's house.

41:20.181 --> 41:22.249
Gideon escaped,

41:22.249 --> 41:24.719
but they were able
to recover documents

41:24.719 --> 41:28.122
and e‐mails and photos
of murder victims

41:28.122 --> 41:30.124

41:36.864 --> 41:38.866
(sighs)

41:38.866 --> 41:41.469
And her photo's in there?

41:43.003 --> 41:45.606
Your wife's death
wasn't an accident.

41:45.606 --> 41:47.608

41:51.145 --> 41:53.147
