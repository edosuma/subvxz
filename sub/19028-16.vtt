00:03.331 --> 00:05.208
<i>Today was Laverne's funeral,</i>

00:05.417 --> 00:09.410
<i>but Dr Cox was having more trouble
adjusting to his new baby's name.</i>

00:09.880 --> 00:11.552
What's wrong with Jennifer Dylan?

00:11.757 --> 00:14.954
You named our daughter J.D.

00:15.886 --> 00:19.162
<i>It's a beautiful morning</i>

00:19.431 --> 00:20.500
J. D!

00:21.266 --> 00:23.621
Sorry, I was thinking
about something else.

00:24.728 --> 00:26.958
Why would you do such a thing?

00:27.189 --> 00:28.827
I was hoping that you would hate
the name so much

00:29.024 --> 00:30.901
that you wouldn't be able
to hide your spite from your daughter

00:31.109 --> 00:32.861
and she would love me more than you.

00:33.070 --> 00:34.185
I've got to go.

00:34.362 --> 00:36.432
Don't forget,
momma's coming home tomorrow,

00:36.656 --> 00:39.773
so the fridge needs to be restocked
with rice cakes and vodka.

00:40.035 --> 00:42.868
Jordan, while you were on bed rest
for the last two months,

00:43.121 --> 00:45.555
I served as mother,
father, butler, breadwinner

00:45.791 --> 00:48.703
and, thanks to our son's penchant
for eating nickels and

00:48.960 --> 00:52.555
your irrational fear that they're never
going to pass through his system,

00:52.839 --> 00:54.272
poo-poo sifter.

00:54.466 --> 00:56.104
I was hoping that, upon your return,

00:56.301 --> 01:00.089
you would start to assume
some domestic responsibilities.

01:00.389 --> 01:01.458
Pass.

01:04.393 --> 01:09.626
<i>Amazing grace</i>

01:10.107 --> 01:15.659
<i>How sweet the sound</i>

01:16.321 --> 01:18.073
<i>That saved...</i>

01:18.281 --> 01:22.035
<i>The music was so perfect that
for a moment it made us all happy.</i>

01:22.494 --> 01:23.563
<i>Well, most of us.</i>

01:23.745 --> 01:25.463
I'll tell you why they sound
that good, Roy.

01:25.747 --> 01:28.102
Because they show up for practise.

01:28.792 --> 01:30.748
<i>Everyone reacts differently at funerals.</i>

01:30.961 --> 01:33.953
<i>Some people wear their emotions
on their sleeves,</i>

01:35.882 --> 01:37.679
<i>others are more stoic,</i>

01:39.803 --> 01:42.954
<i>and there's always that one guy
who's completely inappropriate.</i>

01:43.223 --> 01:44.861
I did her autopsy.

01:45.058 --> 01:46.616
I'm her uncle.

01:47.477 --> 01:49.832
Your niece had beautiful guts.

01:50.856 --> 01:52.369
Nice save, chief.

01:53.650 --> 01:57.325
<i>As for me, I couldn't help but imagine
what my own funeral would be like.</i>

01:58.488 --> 02:01.207
<i>My girl wants to party all the time</i>

02:01.450 --> 02:04.169
<i>Party all the time</i>

02:04.411 --> 02:05.400
Yeah!

02:05.620 --> 02:08.532
And as you know,
J.D. only had two requests

02:08.789 --> 02:11.350
and that is that the choir sing the song

02:11.585 --> 02:14.577
that would remind us
of how much he loved to party,

02:14.838 --> 02:18.274
and that he could get one last hug
from each of you.

02:22.596 --> 02:25.269
You're the only one
I never faked it with.

02:26.975 --> 02:28.203
It's true.

02:28.852 --> 02:30.285
Hell, I...

02:30.479 --> 02:31.912
I love you, Newbie.

02:32.105 --> 02:34.665
I should have done this
a long time ago.

02:36.526 --> 02:37.595
I knew you loved me!

02:37.778 --> 02:39.416
I just had to fake my own death
to prove it!

02:39.613 --> 02:40.648
He loves me, everyone!

02:40.822 --> 02:43.097
- Can I get an amen?
- Amen!

02:44.159 --> 02:45.353
God is good!

02:46.203 --> 02:47.352
Worth it.

02:49.331 --> 02:51.720
And then we'd have my real funeral.

02:52.042 --> 02:54.875
- Are you an idiot?
- No, sir, I'm a dreamer.

03:11.269 --> 03:13.146
Brothers and sisters,
as we leave here today,

03:13.355 --> 03:14.834
let's not mourn Laverne's passing.

03:15.023 --> 03:16.581
- Amen?
- Amen!

03:16.775 --> 03:20.211
Let us celebrate her life,
for isn't that what she'd want us to do?

03:21.530 --> 03:23.680
That's where she got that.

03:24.366 --> 03:26.277
Let us live like she lived

03:26.493 --> 03:30.964
and don't be afraid to open your heart
to those that are dear to you. Amen?

03:31.289 --> 03:32.802
Amen.

03:33.166 --> 03:36.397
And always make sure you put yourself
in other people's shoes

03:36.670 --> 03:38.342
before you judge them. Is that all right?

03:38.547 --> 03:39.616
That's right.

03:39.798 --> 03:42.266
And no matter how busy life gets,

03:42.509 --> 03:45.785
I want you to take 20 minutes
every day for yourself,

03:46.054 --> 03:49.649
so you can reflect on who you are
as one of God's children. Amen?

03:49.933 --> 03:51.332
Amen.

03:51.518 --> 03:54.078
I love you and there's absolutely
nothing you can do about it.

03:54.312 --> 03:55.540
Thank you for coming.

03:55.731 --> 04:00.441
<i>Amazing grace</i>

04:00.777 --> 04:03.655
<i>It was weird because even though
we were all caught up in the moment,</i>

04:03.905 --> 04:07.136
<i>once we got to work,
we fell right back into our routines.</i>

04:07.409 --> 04:09.081
Turk, she's back.

04:09.995 --> 04:12.304
Oh, my God, Tammy Two Toes.

04:12.539 --> 04:13.574
So that's it?

04:13.749 --> 04:15.148
One second we're mourning Laverne

04:15.333 --> 04:17.244
and the next you're making up
ridiculous nicknames?

04:17.461 --> 04:18.814
Baby, what am I supposed to call her?

04:19.004 --> 04:21.040
Her name's Tammy
and she's got two toes.

04:21.255 --> 04:22.655
I hate this.

04:22.841 --> 04:26.151
Everybody's moving on
as if Laverne was never even here.

04:26.428 --> 04:27.417
Babe...

04:27.596 --> 04:29.791
It's like her feet are giving me
the peace sign.

04:30.015 --> 04:31.892
<i>What Carla didn't know
was that some people</i>

04:32.100 --> 04:34.295
<i>were already taking
Laverne's life lessons to heart.</i>

04:34.519 --> 04:35.838
Perry, could I ask you a favour?

04:36.021 --> 04:38.694
Actually, Bob,
out of respect for Laverne, no.

04:38.940 --> 04:41.249
You see, according to the
Right Reverend Jimmy T. Gibbons,

04:41.485 --> 04:43.840
that's the name I gave
the minister in my mind,

04:44.071 --> 04:48.781
every day, Bob, every day,
I am to take 20 minutes for myself.

04:49.493 --> 04:53.008
Right about now,
I'm going to be entering my imaginary,

04:53.288 --> 04:55.961
soundproof glass bubble.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.199
That way, I don't have to be...

05:02.214 --> 05:04.887
I was just going to ask you
to keep your yapper shut

05:05.133 --> 05:07.931
while I read the paper,
so everybody wins.

05:08.178 --> 05:09.167
Dr Cox.

05:09.346 --> 05:12.418
You might want to knock.
He's in an imaginary glass bubble.

05:15.268 --> 05:17.224
- What?
- I need help with a patient.

05:17.437 --> 05:18.552
Twenty minutes.

05:18.730 --> 05:21.927
Hey, how long does it take
for an old woman to bleed to death?

05:26.405 --> 05:28.441
<i>I still had the post-funeral blues,</i>

05:28.657 --> 05:32.286
<i>so I pulled out my secret weapon
to bribe Turk into hanging out with me.</i>

05:32.577 --> 05:33.976
I'm going to get
that sour ball today, right?

05:34.162 --> 05:37.040
If I give it up right away,
you won't respect me.

05:37.290 --> 05:38.689
Hello, Mr Frances.

05:38.875 --> 05:41.628
When did your son start having
stomach pains?

05:42.504 --> 05:44.859
Oh, I'm sorry, you're deaf.
It's okay, it's all right.

05:45.090 --> 05:47.763
Will you help me communicate
with your dad?

05:48.760 --> 05:51.399
Oh, you're deaf, too.
What are the odds?

05:52.180 --> 05:53.579
I'm a doctor,
I should probably know that.

05:53.765 --> 05:56.359
Here, I'll just write the questions down.
Give me your pen.

05:56.601 --> 05:58.432
I don't have a pen.
My pockets are empty.

05:58.645 --> 05:59.998
Except for the sour ball.

06:00.188 --> 06:02.543
Turk, there never was a sour ball.

06:04.192 --> 06:06.626
I knew that,
I just didn't want to believe it.

06:16.288 --> 06:17.277
Dr Cox.

06:17.456 --> 06:20.448
- Do you know sign language?
- I know just one sign.

06:24.296 --> 06:27.606
It means leave me alone
for 20 minutes or die painfully.

06:27.883 --> 06:29.236
Dr Cox.

06:29.426 --> 06:31.576
We can't place the chest tube
in Mr Carney and he's crashing,

06:31.803 --> 06:33.839
- so I'd really...
- For the love of God!

06:34.056 --> 06:35.774
Dr Kelso, do you know sign language?

06:39.936 --> 06:41.574
Is that a really commonly used sign?

06:41.772 --> 06:42.807
I'm calling personnel.

06:42.981 --> 06:45.449
There's got to be someone in
this hospital that does sign language.

06:46.860 --> 06:47.815
Doctors.

06:47.986 --> 06:49.578
- Get out of here.
- Get the heck out of here!

06:49.780 --> 06:51.372
You don't know how to sign...

07:00.457 --> 07:04.530
Elliot, I know I was supposed
to be sad at that funeral,

07:05.212 --> 07:06.327
but all I could think about was

07:06.505 --> 07:09.542
how lucky I am to have you
in my life, you know?

07:10.217 --> 07:14.096
I'm sorry, I'm just not really
in the mood for relationshipy talk.

07:15.222 --> 07:16.621
Yeah, sure.

07:16.807 --> 07:19.765
And don't you dare remove that tie.

07:20.018 --> 07:23.772
Let me guess, you want to do
some crazy, sexual role-playing.

07:24.064 --> 07:27.773
No! I just never get the chance
to see you in a suit, that's all.

07:28.068 --> 07:29.626
- Elliot.
- Fine.

07:29.820 --> 07:31.776
I'm a trailer-trashy pop star
who rarely wears underwear

07:31.988 --> 07:33.023
and you're one of my back-up dancers

07:33.198 --> 07:34.836
who's not quite sure
about his sexuality yet!

07:35.075 --> 07:38.306
No, I don't want to do Britney
and K-Fed any more.

07:38.578 --> 07:40.728
Ever since the divorce, it's too sad.

07:41.248 --> 07:42.920
Okay...

07:43.208 --> 07:45.847
You're one of Rhode Island's
top defence attorneys

07:46.086 --> 07:48.156
and I have just hired you
because I killed my husband

07:48.380 --> 07:50.769
in an argument
over my addiction to painkillers.

07:51.007 --> 07:51.996
Got it.

07:55.929 --> 07:58.966
"His medical records are in Michigan
with his mom.

07:59.266 --> 08:00.665
"He's only with me for a week. "

08:00.851 --> 08:02.250
Okay, well,
tell him we're going to run some tests

08:02.436 --> 08:05.109
and we'll be back
once we get the results.

08:07.941 --> 08:10.057
How do you know sign language?

08:10.360 --> 08:14.478
Well, when I was in high school, I was
a volunteer janitor at the Hoboken Zoo.

08:14.781 --> 08:18.091
And one night I was out plucking
peacock feathers to sell for pens

08:18.368 --> 08:21.121
when I noticed Gary the gorilla making
the sign for food.

08:21.371 --> 08:23.680
I gave him my Danish,
he gave the sign for "Thank you. "

08:23.915 --> 08:26.873
Those were the only two signs
that Gary knew, except for "boobs. "

08:27.127 --> 08:29.687
- He liked them big and hairy.
- Join the club, player.

08:29.921 --> 08:31.479
- Get away.
- Okay.

08:31.673 --> 08:34.664
So, eventually, Gary, I'm sorry to say,
died of lung cancer.

08:34.926 --> 08:38.043
For that I blame myself because
I used to share my smokes with him.

08:38.304 --> 08:40.500
But he also piqued
my interest in signing,

08:40.724 --> 08:43.796
and in his memory
I took my first signing class.

08:44.061 --> 08:45.699
Is any of that true?

08:45.896 --> 08:48.126
Someone would have to
read it back to me.

08:49.691 --> 08:51.761
What's up your caboodle?

08:52.069 --> 08:53.104
Caboodle?

08:53.278 --> 08:55.508
Oh, it's a new word I'm trying out
to replace "ass. "

08:55.739 --> 08:57.775
I have loose morals
and I'm living in sin,

08:57.991 --> 09:01.108
so still hoping that not being
a potty mouth will get me into heaven.

09:01.370 --> 09:02.883
Well, I was just thinking
it would be nice

09:03.080 --> 09:06.629
if people at least acted like
they missed Laverne, you know?

09:06.917 --> 09:09.226
Hey, Elliot. Look...

09:10.087 --> 09:12.043
I know this weekend
is our one-year anniversary,

09:12.255 --> 09:16.248
but my college buddy, Donny, is
in Vegas and he wants me to fly out.

09:16.927 --> 09:19.566
- Coolio.
- All right.

09:21.390 --> 09:22.823
Are you for real?

09:23.016 --> 09:24.449
That's a trick, right?

09:24.643 --> 09:25.871
I mean, when he comes back
from Vegas,

09:26.061 --> 09:27.779
you're going to tear him a new one.

09:27.979 --> 09:29.014
No.

09:29.815 --> 09:32.488
With Keith, I've decided I'm going
to be the best girlfriend ever.

09:32.734 --> 09:35.931
If that means skipping
some silly anniversary, that's fine.

09:36.196 --> 09:37.788
If it means having some crazy sex

09:37.989 --> 09:40.981
and then running off without cuddling
to go meet the fellas for a beer, great.

09:41.243 --> 09:42.517
I might cry.

09:42.703 --> 09:45.820
Man, if you were just 40 years older.

09:49.167 --> 09:50.441
Hey, check this out.

09:50.627 --> 09:53.983
Not only does our deaf kid only
have a mild case of gastroenteritis,

09:54.256 --> 09:56.053
they just faxed me his medical history.

09:56.258 --> 09:57.657
His condition is congenital.

09:57.843 --> 09:59.322
They tried a hearing aid
with no results,

09:59.511 --> 10:02.344
but I think he's a perfect candidate
for a cochlear implant.

10:02.597 --> 10:05.270
- I think we can make this kid hear.
- Dude, that's amazing.

10:05.517 --> 10:08.475
Can you teach me how to sign,
"I think we can fix your son's hearing"?

10:08.729 --> 10:09.798
Or I could just tell him?

10:09.980 --> 10:11.572
I think it's best if he hear it
from a doctor.

10:11.773 --> 10:13.604
No, you just want the glory.

10:13.817 --> 10:15.933
Are you really that emotionally needy?

10:16.153 --> 10:17.108
Have we not met?

10:17.279 --> 10:19.315
Oh, you're right.
I'm sorry, wasn't thinking.

10:19.531 --> 10:22.762
Look, why don't we go in there
and split the glory three ways, okay?

10:23.035 --> 10:24.753
Let's go, the three doctors.

10:25.746 --> 10:27.498
<i>Nothing is ever easy around here.</i>

10:27.706 --> 10:31.494
<i>Whether it's something as simple as
trying to find 20 minutes for yourself...</i>

10:32.377 --> 10:36.131
Dr Cox, can we go somewhere
and talk about Laverne for a while?

10:36.423 --> 10:40.177
That sounds like exactly
what I want to do.

10:41.428 --> 10:43.100
<i>Or something as big as finding out</i>

10:43.305 --> 10:45.216
<i>your relationship isn't going
as well as you thought.</i>

10:45.432 --> 10:47.468
Hey, Keith,
can you pass me a fake sugar?

10:47.684 --> 10:50.562
Elliot, this relationship
isn't working for me.

10:51.813 --> 10:53.804
Well, that sucks caboodle.

10:54.691 --> 10:57.808
<i>Still, none of that matters when you
get to change someone's life forever.</i>

11:08.830 --> 11:11.708
- What'd he say?
- He said, "No, thank you. "

11:15.337 --> 11:17.487
<i>No father would deny his son
the chance to hear,</i>

11:17.714 --> 11:19.705
<i>so we knew it had to be
a misunderstanding.</i>

11:19.925 --> 11:21.677
<i>We told the Janitor to clear things up.</i>

11:21.885 --> 11:23.477
You know, if we learnt sign language,

11:23.678 --> 11:26.033
we could talk in the movies
without Carla yelling at us.

11:26.264 --> 11:28.414
But it's so dark.
How could we see what we're signing?

11:28.642 --> 11:31.031
We'd get special
glow-in-the-dark signing gloves.

11:31.269 --> 11:33.544
Yeah, but then the popcorn butter
would get all over the gloves.

11:33.772 --> 11:36.445
Why do you keep poking holes in this?
We'd cut off the fingertips.

11:36.691 --> 11:37.806
Okay, I'm in.

11:40.445 --> 11:42.242
Well, I told him everything you said.

11:42.447 --> 11:44.244
His kid's the perfect age
for the procedure,

11:44.449 --> 11:47.247
his insurance will cover it
and he's still not interested.

11:48.453 --> 11:50.762
Elliot, I don't have a friend
in Vegas, okay?

11:50.997 --> 11:54.194
That was a test to see
if you even care about our anniversary.

11:54.459 --> 11:55.448
Obviously, you don't.

11:55.627 --> 11:58.095
Why are you trying to mess up
a good thing?

11:58.338 --> 12:00.329
Oh, so now my feelings don't count?

12:00.549 --> 12:02.107
Look, I...

12:05.137 --> 12:08.368
- Sir, can we help you here?
- Oh, you already are, sweetheart.

12:08.640 --> 12:12.997
I forgot to bring my paper down here,
but this gabfest is just delicious.

12:13.311 --> 12:16.064
So, go on. You were
talking about your relationship,

12:16.314 --> 12:19.511
only it was like he's the chick
and you're the dude.

12:19.776 --> 12:21.414
All you think about is sex.

12:21.611 --> 12:23.363
Here we go, nag, nag, nag.

12:24.072 --> 12:25.141
You nagger.

12:25.323 --> 12:26.995
What'd you just call him,
you punk ass?

12:27.200 --> 12:29.270
- A "nagger. "
- Okay, we're cool.

12:31.663 --> 12:34.575
Elliot, you're always talking
to everyone else about marriage

12:34.833 --> 12:38.428
and having babies, but you've never
seriously talked about it with me.

12:38.712 --> 12:40.270
I love you, okay?

12:40.464 --> 12:42.216
You know,
you've never said that to me before?

12:42.424 --> 12:44.460
And that's fine, I can wait.

12:44.968 --> 12:48.438
But if we're not moving
towards something, I need to know.

12:50.098 --> 12:52.328
So, are you going to say anything?

12:53.935 --> 12:56.085
I really don't know what I'd say.

12:56.313 --> 12:57.985
Well, then forget it.

13:00.817 --> 13:03.456
Bitches, huh?
What are you going to do?

13:06.281 --> 13:08.351
Okay, what's the problem?

13:08.575 --> 13:10.054
Laverne was our friend

13:10.243 --> 13:12.552
and people are walking around
like she never existed.

13:12.788 --> 13:14.016
It's not right, you know?

13:14.206 --> 13:16.845
- Yeah, tough crap.
- Excuse me?

13:17.084 --> 13:20.759
You can't tell other people
how to feel, you just can't.

13:21.046 --> 13:22.718
Some want to cry, that's fine.

13:22.923 --> 13:25.801
Others may choose to laugh.
And guess what? That's okay, too.

13:26.051 --> 13:29.487
Plus, you don't know what's going on
inside people's heads. Take...

13:30.931 --> 13:32.330
Take Pee Pants here.

13:32.516 --> 13:35.792
Now, how do you know he's not
thinking about Laverne right now?

13:36.061 --> 13:37.972
I am thinking about her.

13:38.188 --> 13:41.146
I haven't seen my cell phone
since her autopsy.

13:41.400 --> 13:44.517
- You don't think if I call it...
- You're done.

13:44.778 --> 13:47.975
So, to sum up, tough crap.

13:48.782 --> 13:50.295
Hope that helps.

13:51.284 --> 13:54.640
People, before I disappear
for 20 minutes,

13:54.913 --> 13:56.426
I want to make sure
all of my patients are alive.

13:56.623 --> 13:58.614
A simple "still here" will suffice.

13:58.834 --> 14:00.313
Sound off like you got a pair.

14:00.502 --> 14:02.060
- Still here.
- Still here.

14:03.463 --> 14:06.500
Ted, we know denying surgery
isn't technically child abuse.

14:06.758 --> 14:09.591
We're just wondering
if we have any legal recourse.

14:09.845 --> 14:11.915
Just give me one second.

14:12.848 --> 14:14.406
Are you looking for a legal precedent?

14:14.683 --> 14:17.800
No, I'm looking up the word "recourse. "

14:18.061 --> 14:19.494
Recourse...

14:19.688 --> 14:20.677
Dr Cox!

14:20.856 --> 14:23.165
What? What now?
What does somebody need now?

14:23.400 --> 14:25.470
Our deaf patient's father
won't sign a consent form

14:25.694 --> 14:27.685
so he can have a cochlear implant.

14:28.238 --> 14:31.355
Who could you possibly go to
if the father won't sign?

14:31.616 --> 14:36.406
Here's a hint, it begins with an "M"
and ends with an "R."

14:36.747 --> 14:38.180
Marg Helgenberger.

14:38.373 --> 14:41.092
The mother, get the mother to sign it.
The mother will sign it.

14:41.334 --> 14:42.926
- The mother! Come on...
- The mother! I told you!

14:43.128 --> 14:46.200
I'm glad it's not Marg.
We did not end well.

14:46.465 --> 14:48.925
Hell hath no fury
like a Helgenberger scorned.

14:49.009 --> 14:50.761
Scorned...

14:51.219 --> 14:52.732
After "R"...

14:56.600 --> 14:58.750
So, Keith's been on your case
about getting serious?

14:58.977 --> 15:02.936
Totally. Plus he wants me to be all,
like, open and honest about how I feel.

15:03.231 --> 15:05.586
I mean, do you guys talk like that
in your relationships?

15:05.817 --> 15:08.377
I tell Turk I love him all the time.

15:08.612 --> 15:11.968
- I wish I'd told Laverne more.
- Downer!

15:12.908 --> 15:16.218
- I haven't seen you in a while.
- Oh, she just had a baby.

15:16.912 --> 15:19.790
Well, then how can you be drinking?
Aren't you breastfeeding?

15:20.040 --> 15:22.395
I haven't decided.
Were you breastfed?

15:22.626 --> 15:24.344
Of course I was.

15:24.544 --> 15:28.173
That is so interesting
'cause you're a slaggy buttinski

15:28.465 --> 15:30.854
who ended up becoming a waitress
for a living.

15:31.093 --> 15:33.653
Maybe breastfeeding isn't the answer.

15:35.722 --> 15:37.952
This is the greatest night ever.

15:38.266 --> 15:39.221
You know what?

15:39.393 --> 15:40.872
I mean, if I really did have
deep feelings for Keith,

15:41.061 --> 15:42.972
I would've told him by now.

15:43.355 --> 15:46.665
- Maybe it is time to move on.
- That's a bunch of crap.

15:48.151 --> 15:50.267
- Excuse me?
- You're a chicken.

15:51.446 --> 15:54.119
In the last six years, I've seen you
get really close to one guy,

15:54.366 --> 15:56.596
and that was J.D., and he crushed you.

15:56.827 --> 15:59.136
And since then,
you've been so scared of getting hurt,

15:59.371 --> 16:02.169
I've seen you sabotage
every relationship you've been in.

16:02.416 --> 16:05.613
Honestly, you must be crazy about
Keith to let him have survived this long.

16:05.877 --> 16:08.949
But don't worry,
you'll be alone again soon enough.

16:09.631 --> 16:13.101
You know, Carla, sometimes
you can be a real caboodle-hole.

16:19.182 --> 16:21.218
Oh, now, Bob, what the hell?

16:21.435 --> 16:23.790
Have you just been sitting
on your pruny keister all day

16:24.020 --> 16:26.170
- reading the paper?
- Heavens, no.

16:26.398 --> 16:29.231
I also went downstairs
to get a cup of coffee.

16:31.653 --> 16:34.451
Well, it must be nice not having
everyone want a piece of you.

16:34.698 --> 16:37.337
If one more person interrupts
my me-time,

16:37.576 --> 16:39.373
I'm going to go ahead
and get a tattoo of my hand

16:39.578 --> 16:41.455
giving the middle finger
on the back of my head.

16:41.663 --> 16:42.652
Why not?

16:42.831 --> 16:46.141
It's not as though it could make
you look any more like a psychopath.

16:46.418 --> 16:49.490
Whatever it takes
to get them to leave me alone.

16:49.755 --> 16:51.188
You love it.

16:52.257 --> 16:55.169
- How's that?
- Being everybody's go-to guy.

16:55.761 --> 16:59.231
Perry, people do not
do things over and over

16:59.514 --> 17:02.108
unless they get some kind of joy
out of it.

17:02.350 --> 17:05.022
I've been watching you
for 20 years, champ.

17:05.270 --> 17:08.546
Your joy comes from being needed.
That's who you are.

17:15.030 --> 17:16.019
He wants to know what's going on.

17:16.198 --> 17:18.428
Tell him we're prepping his son
for surgery.

17:18.657 --> 17:20.694
We got the mother's consent.

17:21.078 --> 17:24.787
And tell him,
if you know the sign, that is, "Boo-yah!"

17:25.499 --> 17:26.727
Boo-yah!

17:26.916 --> 17:28.794
- Nazi salute.
- Oh, my bad.

17:35.050 --> 17:38.122
- Keith?
- What, Elliot?

17:38.720 --> 17:40.472
How can I say this?

17:41.264 --> 17:43.141
Look, I once had a dog
named Precious.

17:43.350 --> 17:46.023
He was a Great Dane
and I loved him so much.

17:46.269 --> 17:49.227
I mean, even after he disemboweled
Old Lady Morgan's cat.

17:49.481 --> 17:51.278
Seriously, he, like, slit her
right down the middle

17:51.483 --> 17:54.077
and threw her up in the air
and then the guts just flew out of her

17:54.319 --> 17:56.196
like shiny red fireworks.

17:57.489 --> 17:59.241
Precious was such a sweet dog,

17:59.449 --> 18:02.521
and then one day,
out of the blue, he bit me.

18:02.786 --> 18:04.538
And I knew that my dad
would have him put down,

18:04.746 --> 18:07.544
so I said that I was bitten
by Mrs. Morgan's bulldog,

18:07.791 --> 18:10.863
which, ironically enough, she had
gotten to replace the murdered cat.

18:11.128 --> 18:13.801
Anyway, they came
and took the bulldog away

18:14.047 --> 18:16.197
and I never said a word.

18:18.343 --> 18:22.177
To this day, I wish that I had spoken up
before it was too late.

18:22.973 --> 18:25.965
- Do you know what I'm saying?
- Not even a little.

18:29.771 --> 18:33.366
I love you, Keith. I really do.

18:35.026 --> 18:36.778
Got to go! See you!

18:39.823 --> 18:41.495
Elliot, come here.

18:59.509 --> 19:02.626
And there he goes, off to surgery.
Fists in.

19:02.888 --> 19:03.843
Blow it up!

19:05.432 --> 19:06.501
You know what's weird?

19:06.683 --> 19:09.800
He doesn't seem like a bad dad.
He really loves that kid.

19:10.062 --> 19:12.451
It must be hard with the divorce.
He barely gets to see his son.

19:12.689 --> 19:13.838
It would kill me.

19:14.024 --> 19:17.334
Maybe being deaf was the biggest
connection he and his son had.

19:17.611 --> 19:19.806
You know, when I was a kid, I made
my dad teach me sign language

19:20.030 --> 19:22.100
so I could communicate
with my deaf sister.

19:22.324 --> 19:24.394
I ended up closer with her
than with anyone.

19:24.618 --> 19:26.973
Maybe Mr Frances is
afraid of losing that.

19:27.287 --> 19:28.959
Is any of that true?

19:29.164 --> 19:30.358
Mostly.

19:30.540 --> 19:32.337
My dad died before I was born.

19:32.542 --> 19:34.180
Wait a minute, I met your dad.

19:34.461 --> 19:36.179
You met a man.

19:36.797 --> 19:39.595
Guys, we should really go in there
and talk to him.

19:41.426 --> 19:45.942
<i>And like that, Carla knew that Nurse
Roberts was still in all of our heads,</i>

19:46.264 --> 19:49.176
<i>because even if Dr Cox never took
that 20 minutes for himself,</i>

19:49.434 --> 19:50.583
<i>like the minister said,</i>

19:50.769 --> 19:53.602
<i>he still realised who he was
as one of God's children.</i>

19:53.855 --> 19:57.131
Dr Cox, we're having trouble
placing a central line...

19:57.818 --> 20:00.412
You know what? We'll handle it.

20:05.158 --> 20:07.911
It's okay, you can go.
I won't tell anyone.

20:08.495 --> 20:10.213
<i>Elliot had finally opened her heart,</i>

20:10.414 --> 20:12.848
<i>even though it made her feel
more vulnerable than ever.</i>

20:13.083 --> 20:14.277
Hey, Susan, have you seen Keith?

20:14.459 --> 20:15.892
We were supposed to meet here
to ride home together,

20:16.086 --> 20:17.235
but I can't seem to find him.

20:17.421 --> 20:20.299
- Hey, babe. You ready to go?
- Yeah.

20:31.351 --> 20:34.184
<i>As for us, even though it took a while,</i>

20:34.438 --> 20:36.827
<i>we finally put ourselves
in someone else's shoes.</i>

20:37.065 --> 20:40.375
Will you please tell him that
we know this must be hard for him?

20:40.652 --> 20:42.404
This must be hard for you.

20:44.364 --> 20:48.073
He knows. He'll be fine.
He just wants what's best for his son.

20:49.494 --> 20:52.133
"Thank you for interpreting. "
Hey, no problem. That was for me.

20:52.372 --> 20:53.964
Very impressive.

20:54.624 --> 20:56.296
"Stop talking, idiot. "

20:57.305 --> 21:03.566
