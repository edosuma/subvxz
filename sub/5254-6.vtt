Previously on "Faking It"...

00:01.468 --> 00:03.701
I knew I couldn't be with Liam and
keep our friendship so I chose you.

00:05.010 --> 00:07.322
Chose me?

00:07.707 --> 00:09.840
- I gotta go.
- Hey, shrimp girl.

00:09.842 --> 00:12.653
There are no boyfriends around me,
right now.

00:12.673 --> 00:13.677
Not out yet so,

00:13.679 --> 00:15.446
- have to keep things discreet.
- Right.

00:15.448 --> 00:17.981
If you love something set it free.

00:20.445 --> 00:23.093
I could go after morning
church but I have to be back

00:23.113 --> 00:24.380
by evening church.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.805
Lauren, what are you babbling on about,

00:26.825 --> 00:28.758
I tuned you out after
something about a turkey leg.

00:28.760 --> 00:30.426
The renaissance faire this weekend.

00:30.428 --> 00:34.564
As fun as that doesn't sound,
I'm keeping my weekend open.

00:34.566 --> 00:37.566
After a certain recent kiss
from a certain individual

00:37.568 --> 00:41.303
I'm expecting a certain
invitation at any moment.

00:45.312 --> 00:46.957
You're certain?

00:47.011 --> 00:49.444
They have live jousting.

00:49.446 --> 00:52.047
This is even better than
I dreamed it would be.

00:52.049 --> 00:53.315
And I dreamed about it a lot.

00:53.317 --> 00:55.617
You dreamed about us holding hands?

00:55.619 --> 00:57.619
'Cause I dreamed about
us doing other things.

00:57.621 --> 01:00.855
In public,
no more secret art room make outs,

01:00.857 --> 01:02.758
no more secrets at all.

01:02.760 --> 01:04.760
Oh, hey.

01:04.762 --> 01:06.828
Hey.

01:06.830 --> 01:10.865
Red rover, red rover,
send Karma right over.

01:10.867 --> 01:13.067
She's all yours.

01:15.137 --> 01:16.637
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, an infinity

01:16.639 --> 01:18.673
of thank yous for putting us back together.

01:18.675 --> 01:21.509
Uh-huh, so movie night,
should we watch the documentary

01:21.511 --> 01:23.778
on the egyptian revolution or the one on

01:23.780 --> 01:26.547
indonesian death squads?

01:26.549 --> 01:27.682
Too dark?

01:27.684 --> 01:29.350
There's one on prison talent shows.

01:29.352 --> 01:31.852
I know that Friday has
traditionally been movie night,

01:31.854 --> 01:33.321
but traditions evolve.

01:33.323 --> 01:35.222
For instance,
did you know that Friday used to be called

01:35.224 --> 01:36.857
"day of frigg"?

01:36.859 --> 01:39.593
Go on your date, Karma,
it's not a big deal.

01:39.595 --> 01:40.861
Are you sure?

01:40.863 --> 01:44.564
I'm so excited, this'll be our first date.

01:44.566 --> 01:47.067
I'm sorry, that was...
that was totally insensitive of me.

01:47.069 --> 01:48.668
Oh, bad Karma.

01:48.670 --> 01:50.237
What kind of best friend
would I be if you can't talk

01:50.239 --> 01:52.139
about the guy you're dating?

01:52.141 --> 01:53.941
Really? Are you sure?

01:53.943 --> 01:55.531
Totally.

A commentary on the sad state

02:04.919 --> 02:07.487
of plumbing in the 21st century?

02:07.489 --> 02:10.156
It'll make sense when I'm done.

02:10.157 --> 02:12.392
My, my, there sure is an extra bounce

02:12.394 --> 02:13.993
in your bang today, Booker,

02:13.995 --> 02:16.729
and here I thought happiness
was the death of creativity.

02:16.731 --> 02:20.266
No way, the ideas are flowing,
I feel revitalized.

Knock, knock.

02:32.546 --> 02:33.345
Who's there?

02:33.347 --> 02:35.146
You slept with Amy.

02:35.148 --> 02:37.282
I'm not in denial about...

02:37.284 --> 02:40.452
that, I'm just burying it deep,

02:40.454 --> 02:43.121
deep down. For Karma's sake.

02:43.123 --> 02:44.390
How selfless of you.

02:44.392 --> 02:46.291
I make her happy, she makes happy.

02:46.293 --> 02:48.393
The world needs more happiness.

02:48.395 --> 02:49.995
I never thought we'd see the day,

02:49.997 --> 02:54.299
Liam Booker, legit boyfriend.

02:54.301 --> 02:56.968
Liam Booker is my boyfriend,
my very first boyfriend.

02:56.970 --> 02:59.004
It's like getting your first car,
and surprise,

02:59.006 --> 03:00.338
it's a Ferrari.

03:00.340 --> 03:02.407
I hear they get terrible gas mileage.

03:02.409 --> 03:05.410
Time to update my online
relationship status.

03:05.412 --> 03:09.313
Sorry, market, I am off you.

03:09.315 --> 03:12.316
So, you two are exclusive?

03:12.318 --> 03:14.051
Well, uh,

03:14.053 --> 03:16.721
we haven't officially discussed it,
but it's like a given

03:16.723 --> 03:18.790
after everything we've been through.

03:18.792 --> 03:21.992
This is "the"
Liam Booker we're talking about.

03:21.994 --> 03:24.161
Arab princes have had smaller harems.

03:24.163 --> 03:25.695
Well, that's all in the past now.

03:25.697 --> 03:27.331
I just want you to be careful, is all,

03:27.333 --> 03:30.167
don't assume anything
until you talk to him.

03:30.169 --> 03:33.070
You're right. But I'm sure his head's
in the same place.

03:36.409 --> 03:39.242
Hi. Can we talk?

03:39.244 --> 03:42.512
Uh, yeah, sure.
But first, let me show you this.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.080
Oh, okay.

03:44.082 --> 03:46.316
Wow, it's uh...

03:46.318 --> 03:49.404
Here, turn it on.

03:53.825 --> 03:55.191
Whoa. Amazing.

03:55.721 --> 03:59.162
It oughta be, you inspired it.

04:01.222 --> 04:03.499
So tonight is the hester art show.

04:03.501 --> 04:06.635
I usually don't go to these things, but,

04:06.637 --> 04:08.471
this time I kinda want to show off.

04:08.473 --> 04:10.306
Well, I don't blame you.

04:10.308 --> 04:12.775
No, not the piece, you.

04:16.988 --> 04:19.815
So, what did you want to talk about?

04:19.817 --> 04:21.605
Oh, um,

04:22.387 --> 04:26.689
just wanted to tell you that
you're the best boyfriend, ever.

to pick a [Bleep] movie.

with the door unlocked?

05:15.771 --> 05:17.537
That's catnip for serial killers.

05:17.539 --> 05:19.472
Come on, I'm taking you out.
I just got the pin

05:19.474 --> 05:21.708
for a super secret underground dance party.

05:21.710 --> 05:23.476
I don't like being underground...

05:23.478 --> 05:25.078
fear of being buried alive.

05:25.080 --> 05:28.348
Didn't gays invent apps full of boy toys
just for occasions like this?

05:28.350 --> 05:31.551
True, but tonight I'm not
looking for a trashy hook up.

05:31.553 --> 05:34.787
I wanna have fun... with my friend.

05:34.789 --> 05:36.522
I'm sorry, did you think this was optional?

05:36.524 --> 05:38.725
'Cause no. Trust me, you need this.

05:38.727 --> 05:42.094
Karma's out having fun and so should you.

05:42.764 --> 05:44.930
- Guess it's all yours.
- Sweet,

05:44.932 --> 05:48.033
now let's get you changed
into something more...

05:48.035 --> 05:50.037
anything else.

05:52.605 --> 05:56.341
Strange,
I'm having this weird sensation inside.

05:56.343 --> 05:59.628
I think it might be sympathy.

06:00.314 --> 06:02.848
Ah, should we? She is my sister...

06:03.053 --> 06:05.517
Ish. She might not even wanna go.

06:05.719 --> 06:08.252
- Hey Lauren, would you wanna...
- Go to a sweaty club

06:08.254 --> 06:11.556
where randos can dry hump me?
No, thank you.

06:13.793 --> 06:16.528
On second thought, I did just buy new shoes
that need to be broken in.

06:20.258 --> 06:22.759
So, here we are.

06:22.761 --> 06:24.761
I know what you're thinking,
"Am I in Soho?"

06:24.763 --> 06:28.065
But you're not, you're in the art studio.

06:28.067 --> 06:29.532
Cleans up well,

06:29.534 --> 06:33.070
- like you, my beautiful...
- Muse.

06:33.072 --> 06:35.839
Yeah, I heard you the first time.

06:35.841 --> 06:38.808
Uh, will you excuse me?
I have to take this.

06:38.810 --> 06:40.744
It's not ringing.

06:40.746 --> 06:44.714
But it will be, I'm a little psychic,

06:44.716 --> 06:48.785
like my mother. Be right back.

06:48.787 --> 06:51.554
[Cell phone vibrating]

06:51.556 --> 06:54.924
Hey, aren't you supposed to be
on a date with your boyfriend?

06:54.926 --> 06:57.860
On a date, yes, with my boyfriend, no,

06:57.862 --> 06:59.595
because when I accidentally
called Liam that,

06:59.597 --> 07:01.697
he called me his muse.

07:01.699 --> 07:03.933
- Are you making a face?
- What? No?

07:03.935 --> 07:05.434
Being a muse can be a good thing, right?

07:05.436 --> 07:07.270
I mean,
it's easy to be someone's girlfriend,

07:07.272 --> 07:09.705
but how many people can say
that they're someone's muse?

07:09.707 --> 07:11.640
Not to be a downer, but throughout history,

07:11.642 --> 07:14.142
artists have put their muses on a pedestal.

07:14.144 --> 07:14.943
See?

07:14.945 --> 07:16.412
I love being on a pedestal.

07:16.414 --> 07:19.047
Until they get bored,
and then they toss them aside

07:19.049 --> 07:20.482
like used gum.

07:20.484 --> 07:23.051
But Liam's art is really important to him.

07:23.053 --> 07:25.521
And the fact that I'm his inspiration,

07:25.523 --> 07:27.322
is a beautiful thing.

07:27.324 --> 07:30.926
Maybe you don't understand
because you're not an artist?

07:30.928 --> 07:32.093
Maybe.

07:32.095 --> 07:34.229
I should let you get back to your movie.

07:34.231 --> 07:35.297
I'll call you later.

07:35.299 --> 07:36.631
Great. Can't wait.

07:40.169 --> 07:41.869
Hey, watch it, moron!

07:41.871 --> 07:45.526

I don't want to kill someone,

07:52.882 --> 07:55.483
it really brings the mood down.

07:55.485 --> 07:56.984
Sorry I snapped at you,

07:56.986 --> 07:59.687
low blood sugar makes me hangry.

07:59.689 --> 08:01.455
Is that why you made such a big scene

08:01.457 --> 08:04.291
at that mansion party?

08:04.293 --> 08:08.162
Oh, yeah, that was a prank.

is talking to you,
but I'm not about to let you get away

15:53.053 --> 15:54.786
with calling me on a Friday
night when you probably thought

15:54.788 --> 15:56.655
you could skate by with
leaving a voice-mail

15:56.657 --> 15:58.389
so you wouldn't actually have
to talk to me since all you do

is avoid me and you're being
super confusing and I can't

Huh, that's the million dollar question,
isn't it?

16:19.112 --> 16:21.446
I wanted to believe I had
this fear of commitment,

16:21.448 --> 16:23.981
but it turns out that it's just my guilt

16:23.983 --> 16:27.551
which will not go away no matter
how hard I try to ignore it.

"Karma is my girlfriend"
