WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.500
Ding-dong!

00:09.567 --> 00:11.933
We are back!
(cheering)

00:12.000 --> 00:15.900
This time things
are gonna be pure crazy!

00:19.567 --> 00:21.167
Let's get fucking mortal.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.533
Yay!

00:25.600 --> 00:27.800
Fuck off.
Fucking Divvy.

00:27.867 --> 00:28.900
Yes!

00:28.967 --> 00:31.300
(glass smashes, moaning)

00:31.367 --> 00:35.267
We're gonna be the radgiest
we've ever been.

00:35.333 --> 00:37.300
(cheering)

00:37.367 --> 00:38.433
What the hell?

00:41.900 --> 00:44.367
Ah, fucking yes, Sir!

00:44.433 --> 00:47.033
Aaron!
Fucking mug!

00:47.100 --> 00:49.667
It's gonna be the maddest
of mad tings.

00:49.733 --> 00:51.633
Fucking God!

00:53.333 --> 00:54.567
Oh, my God.

00:56.100 --> 00:57.900
This is amazing.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.100
One big fucked-up family.

01:02.167 --> 01:03.467
Cheers!

01:03.533 --> 01:06.233
(laughter)

01:06.300 --> 01:08.000
Heave!
(all cheer)

01:08.067 --> 01:11.567
I'm sad to be going home cos me
and Marnie have had a mint time
here.

01:11.633 --> 01:14.033
I'm excited to carry
that back on in the Toon.

01:18.933 --> 01:21.133
He's gonna be so disappointed.

01:24.567 --> 01:26.833
I'm not speaking to that girl.

01:26.900 --> 01:30.233
Me and Nathan have always been
close and that. We've changed.

01:30.300 --> 01:33.267
My friendship with him means
more to me than anything.

01:35.867 --> 01:38.367
I pinky promised
I won't try anything tonight.

01:38.433 --> 01:39.800
Course you're gonna try.

01:41.967 --> 01:44.800
Sorry, Gary.
I never break my pinky promises.

01:47.767 --> 01:49.933
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.633
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:52.700 --> 01:55.000
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:55.067 --> 01:58.067
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

01:58.133 --> 02:00.200
I'm preened to perfection.

02:00.267 --> 02:02.600
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:02.667 --> 02:05.433
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.400
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:08.467 --> 02:11.433
My quiff's pure lethal
and my banter is pure naughty.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.733
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:24.067 --> 02:25.467
Mornin' everyone.

02:25.533 --> 02:28.867
Can we talk about how drunk I
was?
Oh, my God, Chloe.

02:28.933 --> 02:32.100
Last night I was so mortal
and Nathan wouldn't speak to us.

02:32.167 --> 02:34.400
I really feel upset
with how things are.

02:34.467 --> 02:36.267
I just want me best friend back.

02:36.333 --> 02:40.500
You were very, very, very, very,
very, very, very, very, very
drunk.

02:40.567 --> 02:43.100
Things between me and Chloe
are very strange.

02:43.167 --> 02:46.467
I haven't spoken to her since
we last fell out and I hate it.

02:46.533 --> 02:48.100
I need to talk to her today.

02:48.167 --> 02:51.933
So... Abbie, you're in the bed.
Mmm.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.800
But last night you weren't
in the bed. What the fuck?

02:54.867 --> 02:57.167
I was in the shag pad with Gary.
(gasps)

02:57.233 --> 02:59.033
No!
(Abbie laughs)

02:59.100 --> 03:02.400
I do like Gary,
but I left him in the shag pad

03:02.467 --> 03:05.000
cos I don't want him to mug
me off like Scott did.

03:05.067 --> 03:07.367
God, Abbie,
do you want the cock inside?

03:07.433 --> 03:09.700
It was that passionate I did
wanna,
but no.

03:09.767 --> 03:13.467
I feel like I'm in control.
You're full on in control.

03:13.533 --> 03:15.467
You cock-blocked him.
(laughs)

03:15.533 --> 03:18.100
I never imagined
Gary and Abbie together.

03:18.167 --> 03:19.767
But I think I like it.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.933
I feel like he's met his match.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.800
Is it actually as big
as what everyone makes out?

03:24.867 --> 03:28.300
It was big.
It's like a full on python.

03:28.367 --> 03:29.700
(groans)
God!

03:32.467 --> 03:33.733
Oh, God.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.133
Gaz.
What?

03:35.200 --> 03:38.600
I need to know the low-down.
What exactly happened?

03:38.667 --> 03:40.833
Come on, did you shag her?
No, I didn't.

03:40.900 --> 03:43.833
Things are cool.
Nothing's serious. We're having
fun.

03:43.900 --> 03:47.833
But she did leave me in the shag
pad.
Burn.

03:47.900 --> 03:49.400
She got up to go somewhere.

03:49.467 --> 03:51.833
I was like, "Get water".
She never came back.

03:51.900 --> 03:52.900
(laughs)

03:52.967 --> 03:55.200
Me and Gary are
in a similar position.

03:55.267 --> 03:58.500
We just came out of
relationships.
We both wanna have fun.

03:58.567 --> 04:00.967
He's lucky.
Abbie feels the same way.

04:01.033 --> 04:04.200
With Abbie,
if you play your cards right,

04:04.267 --> 04:07.267
you could end up being good
friends
as well as having fun.

04:07.333 --> 04:12.033
Little bit like me and Aaron.
Oh! (laughs in shock)

04:12.100 --> 04:15.067
What?
'Talk about Brutal!'

04:15.133 --> 04:17.733
I know how much Aaron
wants to be with Marnie.

04:17.800 --> 04:21.267
This will be crushing him.

04:21.333 --> 04:23.767
What? Did I say something wrong?
A bit of fun?

04:23.833 --> 04:28.100
I guess we're friends with
benefits.
I'm happy if you're happy,
Marns.

04:28.167 --> 04:30.400
I hope we'll be more than that
very soon.

04:30.467 --> 04:32.400
Aaron can go on the pull with
me?

04:32.467 --> 04:35.967
If he wants to. He doesn't want
to.
So, stop trying to force him.

04:36.033 --> 04:37.600
(all laugh)

04:37.667 --> 04:39.100
Breakfast time!

04:41.933 --> 04:43.033
Morning, Abs.

04:44.733 --> 04:46.767
Yous last night was funny,
wasn't it?

04:46.833 --> 04:49.467
Some people had more fun
than others.

04:49.533 --> 04:53.867
It's not awkward between me and
Gary.
We can get up to whatever at
night.

04:53.933 --> 04:56.100
In the morning,
we're still good mates.

04:56.167 --> 04:59.133
What's the dirtiest thing yous
did.
You'll love this.

04:59.200 --> 05:03.200
I'm not gonna tell everyone.
But Nathan will appreciate this
one.

05:05.300 --> 05:08.733
Eurgh! Abbie's dirtier
than what I thought.

05:08.800 --> 05:12.233
I mean, I have done it before
but...
I'm not judging...

05:12.300 --> 05:13.300
Yes I am.

05:15.867 --> 05:17.933
Right, well, today. We're going
out.

05:19.500 --> 05:22.067
It's proper sick.
OK. I'm up for that.

05:22.133 --> 05:25.867
Why don't we get out the house
and see other with the laser
beams.

05:25.933 --> 05:27.200
(imitates shooting)

05:27.267 --> 05:29.300
I'm coming.
No, Chloe.

05:29.367 --> 05:31.900
I think we need to stay,
have a conversation.

05:31.967 --> 05:35.400
Nathan is 100% my best friend
in this house.

05:35.467 --> 05:38.367
And I'm so glad he finally wants
to sort things out.

05:38.433 --> 05:41.700
Marnie, Aaron.
Breakfast for the shaggers.

05:41.767 --> 05:43.567
Was a good one last night.
Was it?

05:43.633 --> 05:44.867
She let us come!

05:44.933 --> 05:48.067
Yeah! Finally come!
(laughs)

05:48.133 --> 05:50.433
I can't believe
Aaron has finally come.

05:50.500 --> 05:53.833
His balls must have been bigger
than my melons.

05:53.900 --> 05:56.233
We're gonna go shoot
each other with laser.

05:56.300 --> 05:58.933
I haven't got energy
after letting that steam off.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.867
We gonna get ready?
(Gary) Yeah.

06:05.967 --> 06:07.767
Howay, lads!

06:07.833 --> 06:10.600
Aaron, you stunk the house out
with that shit.

06:10.667 --> 06:12.767
It makes a change from you,
don't it?

06:12.833 --> 06:15.167
Bye!
Oh, that fucking stinks.

06:15.233 --> 06:18.600
I really hope that Nathan and
Chloe
sort things out.

06:18.667 --> 06:20.333
We're going to laser tag

06:20.400 --> 06:24.067
and I just hope that the guns
don't come out back home.

06:26.933 --> 06:28.867
Hey.
Hi.

06:28.933 --> 06:31.833
This time, me and Chloe
have done nothing but argue.

06:31.900 --> 06:35.333
How can things between me
and my best friend got this bad?

06:35.400 --> 06:36.833
Not liked not talking.

06:36.900 --> 06:40.767
But I feel like this time I have
been
more stubborn with you than
normally.

06:40.833 --> 06:43.067
Of course I wanna get the bond
back.

06:43.133 --> 06:45.333
He needs to realise
he needs to be there.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.967
That's what best friends do.

06:47.033 --> 06:50.100
You know how it's always been
a rollercoaster with Marty.

06:50.167 --> 06:51.967
Obviously he left and I feel
like

06:52.033 --> 06:55.833
that was the time for you to be
there for us and no-one was
though.

06:55.900 --> 06:58.467
I should have checked on you.
I'm sorry for that.

06:58.533 --> 07:00.800
I'm getting upset.
Don't get upset.

07:00.867 --> 07:03.667
I hate that I've made
my best friend this upset.

07:03.733 --> 07:06.133
I'm never gonna argue
with her again.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.033
You're annoying but I love you.

07:08.100 --> 07:09.667
Are we friends?
Yeah.

07:09.733 --> 07:14.133
Thank God we finally made up.
Arguing with Nathan was awful.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.900
And now I can concentrate
on being best friends.

07:16.967 --> 07:19.000
Come on.
Don't forget your glasses.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.933
(imitates shooting)
Oh, yeah!

07:24.000 --> 07:27.633
I actually can't wait for laser
tag.
It's gonna be fucking wicked.

07:27.700 --> 07:29.233
Welcome to Battlezone.

07:29.300 --> 07:31.667
Can I have one team on blue
and one on camel?

07:31.733 --> 07:33.600
I get to pick first. Abbie.

07:33.667 --> 07:38.433
Gary has picked Abbie over
Aaron.
What the fuck?

07:38.500 --> 07:39.600
Marns.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.433
Aaron. See? I knew that would
work!
(laughs)

07:42.500 --> 07:45.067
Just me and Marnie on a team?
That's how it works.

07:45.133 --> 07:49.600
I know they've got three. But me
and Sophie are fucking ready for
it.

07:49.667 --> 07:52.300
Are you ready you bunch of
pussies?

07:54.467 --> 07:57.733
These boys and Abbie are going
down.
(lasers shooting)

07:57.800 --> 07:58.867
Go, Aaron. Go, go.

07:59.900 --> 08:01.700
(yells)

08:02.733 --> 08:06.467
I am having a wicked time and
Abbie
kind of looks sexy with that
gun.

08:06.533 --> 08:09.533
Bit like Lara Croft. Come here,
you.

08:12.300 --> 08:15.300
Before I know it,
Gary is kissing me in the maze.

08:15.367 --> 08:18.600
And I'm not even pissed.
This is weird.

08:19.733 --> 08:22.867
(shoots lasers)
(imitates shooting)

08:22.933 --> 08:25.500
(laughter)

08:25.567 --> 08:26.933
I did it!

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Sophie got the flag
to the base first.

08:29.067 --> 08:31.867
Which means that the boys lose
and the girls win.

08:31.933 --> 08:33.033
Up yours, lads.

08:33.100 --> 08:35.400
Don't mess with the cousins.

08:35.467 --> 08:37.500
What you don't know is,
we let you win.

08:45.933 --> 08:48.667
Who has a kiss
when they're stone cold sober?

08:48.733 --> 08:52.433
That definitely means that you
must
have a little bit of a feeling.

08:52.500 --> 08:55.267
As long as you don't have sex,
what's the harm in fun?

08:57.267 --> 09:01.700
I don't think Abbie should have
sex
because feelings start to come.

09:01.767 --> 09:02.967
So why ruin it?

09:03.033 --> 09:05.567
Fuck 'em. Pass the vibrators
to the shag pad.

09:05.633 --> 09:07.567
We have had a great day.

09:07.633 --> 09:10.867
But it's time to get back,
get ready, and find out

09:10.933 --> 09:13.233
whether Chloe and Nathan
have made up.

09:14.933 --> 09:16.833
Now that me and Chloe have made
up,

09:16.900 --> 09:19.900
the one thing I've missed doing
is having a pamper sesh.

09:22.067 --> 09:24.633
Why haven't I worn
a swimming costume before?

09:24.700 --> 09:28.500
I look fierce. Move over, Kim K.

09:28.567 --> 09:31.500
This has actually turned out
to be a really good day.

09:31.567 --> 09:35.800
I've made up with Nathan
and I'm getting a wash. (both
laugh)

09:38.200 --> 09:39.533
Hello!

09:39.600 --> 09:42.267
Nathan and Chloe
are nowhere to be seen.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.400
Where the fuck are them two
idiots?

09:44.467 --> 09:45.600
(Sophie) Hey!

09:45.667 --> 09:47.433
(Abbie) Oh, my God!

09:47.500 --> 09:49.767
Oh, my God.
You actually suit it Nathan.

09:49.833 --> 09:51.433
Time for my disappearing act.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.067
This is what drag queens do.

09:54.867 --> 09:56.233
(all) Oh!

09:56.300 --> 09:58.900
Looks like my vagina. Big, fat
one.
(all laugh)

09:58.967 --> 10:01.100
By Nathan's and Chloe's face,

10:01.167 --> 10:03.900
I can tell that they've made up.
I'm just so pleased.

10:03.967 --> 10:07.633
I hope that now the family
can go back to how it was.

10:07.700 --> 10:09.600
I literally can't wait for
tonight.

10:09.667 --> 10:13.267
No dramz, no arguments.
Family's together. (all cheer)

10:13.333 --> 10:16.067
Big night out
Who wants to see me balls?

10:16.133 --> 10:18.800
(Aaron laughs)
What the fuck is that?!

10:18.867 --> 10:21.367
That's my cue to leave, man.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.600
We've had a great day today.

10:26.667 --> 10:30.767
Chloe and Nathan have made up.
Tonight is gonna be fucking
amazing.

10:30.833 --> 10:32.133
Oh, look at that!

10:40.200 --> 10:45.600
I feel like me and Aaron have
got
so close emotionally and
sexually.

10:45.667 --> 10:49.033
I wanna keep it casual.
I've just gotten out a
relationship.

10:51.700 --> 10:53.700
Me and Aaron'll never rule it
out.

10:53.767 --> 10:56.767
But right now, I wanna be single
for at least a year.

10:56.833 --> 10:58.867
Just have fun.
I think you need to be.

10:58.933 --> 11:01.400
I hoped that "Maaron"
would happen this time.

11:01.467 --> 11:04.633
But Marnie's right.
She's probably not ready for it.

11:04.700 --> 11:07.767
You don't wanna rush.
Do not wanna be tied down.

11:07.833 --> 11:11.167
Like if I don't wanna wear
any knickers, I don't have to.

11:13.500 --> 11:14.600
How was laser tag?

11:14.667 --> 11:17.467
Erm, Gaz and Abbie were necking
on
under cover.

11:17.533 --> 11:18.933
Again? More necking on?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.967
Aaron, you weren't meant
to say anything.

11:22.033 --> 11:23.733
Threw me right under the bus.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.567
What does this mean?
Nothing.

11:25.633 --> 11:30.200
Kissing in the day and at
night...
Is this love's young dream?

11:30.267 --> 11:34.067
She was tempted to have sex...
Chloe, you're not mean to say
that.

11:34.133 --> 11:37.433
Abbie's fit. She's up for a
laugh.
She likes the Beadle.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.300
Tonight could be interesting.

11:39.367 --> 11:41.233
Made an impression in the shag
pad.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.300
(wolf whistles)

11:44.367 --> 11:47.000
Oh, hello, Kitty catty.

11:47.067 --> 11:50.633
I'm happy me and you are
friends.
The family is back together.

11:50.700 --> 11:52.800
Cheers!
(all silent)

11:52.867 --> 11:55.200
(all laugh)

11:55.267 --> 11:57.600
All right, let's go.
Bog off.

11:57.667 --> 12:01.833
I'm glad me and Nathan have made
up.
That means tonight is gonna be
wild.

12:01.900 --> 12:04.100
Cannot wait to get mortal
with me bezzie.

12:04.167 --> 12:06.867
(dance music playing)

12:09.333 --> 12:10.833
Come on!

12:14.600 --> 12:17.567
We walk into the club
and it's going off.

12:17.633 --> 12:19.100
Tonight is gonna be mint.

12:22.367 --> 12:23.700
Tonight has been mint.

12:25.300 --> 12:28.367
Can't let Marnie know
how gutted I am.

12:28.433 --> 12:31.067
Let's see how many I can get
in me gob!

12:31.133 --> 12:32.633
(all cheer)

12:32.700 --> 12:34.767
Life is sweet.

12:36.967 --> 12:38.867
(sobs)

12:38.933 --> 12:41.000
Geordie Shore, why-aye.

12:43.967 --> 12:44.167
.

12:46.700 --> 12:46.900
.

12:52.500 --> 12:55.767
(dance music playing)

13:00.133 --> 13:03.867
Now me and Chloe are friends,
we can get drunk with each other

13:03.933 --> 13:05.767
and carry on like we used to.

13:05.833 --> 13:07.167
The days I've missed.

13:07.233 --> 13:08.267
(both laugh)

13:10.767 --> 13:12.900
Yes, Nathan.

13:12.967 --> 13:15.433
Marnie called her and Aaron
"Just friends"

13:15.500 --> 13:18.433
which is different
to what Aaron was saying last
night.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.933
I don't want Marnie
to hurt my best friend.

13:21.033 --> 13:24.300
If there's anyone who knows
where her heads at, it's Sophie.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.933
I just feel like
Marnie's using Aaron a bit.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.467
She thinks he's a bit of fun.
Aaron thinks its gonna go
somewhere.

13:40.533 --> 13:44.167
I'm always gonna have Aaron's
back.
I don't wanna see him get hurt.

13:46.067 --> 13:48.100
Gary's gonna have to talk
to Marnie.

13:48.167 --> 13:52.467
I've had enough of talking about
everyone else's relationships.

13:52.533 --> 13:55.367
Especially when no-one asks
me about mine.

14:02.167 --> 14:05.233
Abbie's looking fit
but I know she's playing hard to
get.

14:05.300 --> 14:07.433
So, let the games continue.

14:16.100 --> 14:18.000
Has the bloke heard of romance?

14:18.067 --> 14:21.933
I am tempted but it's gonna take
more than that to get me into
bed.

14:24.733 --> 14:26.533
Abbie's got balls and I like
that.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.667
I might be
fresh out of a relationship

14:28.733 --> 14:31.000
but she's definitely keeping
me on my toes.

14:35.967 --> 14:40.133
We're all in the club having a
wicked
night, then Sophie bursts into
tears.

14:40.200 --> 14:41.200
What's going on?

14:47.233 --> 14:49.833
I've been thinking about Joel
a lot recently.

14:49.900 --> 14:51.833
We've been together for six
years.

14:51.900 --> 14:55.267
Being in this house makes us
wonder
what he's up to.

14:57.800 --> 15:01.733
I hate seeing her like this.
She's me best friend and me
cousin.

15:01.800 --> 15:04.067
She just needs to stay strong.
She's got me.

15:10.933 --> 15:12.533
Even though I do feel sad,

15:12.600 --> 15:16.933
I've got to remember I do have
these
crazy, fucked up people around
us.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.467
So I'm gonna enjoy my night
and not worry about my
relationship.

15:22.300 --> 15:24.333
(dance music playing)

15:28.400 --> 15:30.400
Fuck it. I'm doing it.

15:32.033 --> 15:35.600
I'm gonna tell Marnie
what Aaron said. (breathes
deeply)

15:43.800 --> 15:47.733
I've just gotten out a
relationship
and Aaron's let me down in the
past.

15:47.800 --> 15:49.500
I just wanna take things slow.

15:56.167 --> 15:59.267
What is with me and Aaron?
We care about each other so
much.

15:59.333 --> 16:02.300
But it's never the right time.
Maybe one day it will be.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.400
(both laugh)
Tonight is amazing.

16:10.467 --> 16:14.267
Me and Marnie are getting on so
well
and this is why I wanna be with
her.

16:21.333 --> 16:22.467
What's she saying?

16:31.567 --> 16:34.067
Come on, Marnie. Man up.
You can do this.

16:34.133 --> 16:36.533
It's only fair
I tell Aaron where me heads at.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.633
It's so hard
cos I don't wanna hurt him.

16:50.233 --> 16:52.567
I can't let Marnie know
how gutted I am.

16:52.633 --> 16:54.733
I really hoped she'd feel the
same.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.700
(dance music playing)

16:59.433 --> 17:03.167
Tonight has been mint. But it's
time
to round up the crew and go
back.

17:07.333 --> 17:09.700
Right, come on.
Ow.

17:09.767 --> 17:11.933
(laughs)
Gary!

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
Everyone at the minute is
getting on
so well. I fucking love it.

17:17.567 --> 17:19.967
I am mortal.
I can barely see straight.

17:20.032 --> 17:22.400
I need to go
straight to fucking bed.

17:22.467 --> 17:25.567
Night, everybody. I love you.
Night-night.

17:25.633 --> 17:27.733
There is 18 chicken nuggets
here.

17:27.800 --> 17:28.967
With Chloe in bed,

17:29.033 --> 17:32.200
I've got an idea we can do
with all the extra chicken
nuggets.

17:32.267 --> 17:34.567
Let's see how many I can get
in me gob.

17:34.633 --> 17:36.800
Right, one. Pace it well.

17:36.867 --> 17:38.667
Two.
Two.

17:38.733 --> 17:41.533
Nathan is shoving
them chicken nuggets in

17:41.600 --> 17:43.133
like he's a human dustbin.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.233
13, 14... Go on, Nathan!

17:45.300 --> 17:46.967
Come on!
More, more.

17:47.033 --> 17:48.667
What the fuck?

17:48.733 --> 17:51.500
Go on Nath. Two more.
(laughs)

17:51.567 --> 17:52.967
Actually lost for words.

17:53.033 --> 17:55.300
One more, one more!
Get it in!

17:55.367 --> 18:00.033
(all cheer)
Oh, fuck off. Fuck off!

18:01.533 --> 18:02.833
There's a lot in there.

18:02.900 --> 18:06.000
OH, MY GOD!
We've done it. We've done it.

18:06.067 --> 18:11.133
(all cheer)

18:11.200 --> 18:16.400
I am the chicken nugget
champion.
I just wanna thank me mam, my
dad,

18:16.467 --> 18:20.167
and all the poor chickens who
were
involved so I could win this
award.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.600
I can't help being
a chicken nugget sucker.

18:22.667 --> 18:24.033
(both laugh)
Oh, hey!

18:25.267 --> 18:27.333
Tonight has been so emotional.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.000
I need to go to bed
cos I'm fucking knackered.

18:31.067 --> 18:33.233
(clattering)
(Gary) Oh!

18:33.300 --> 18:35.333
I have had such a good night
with Gary.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.600
And I'm a bit horny too.

18:37.667 --> 18:39.867
I'm gonna stay in bed with him.
Buzzing.

18:39.933 --> 18:41.200
(hands slap)

18:41.267 --> 18:42.867
Good night.
Happy shagging.

18:42.933 --> 18:44.600
I've had a wicked night.

18:44.667 --> 18:47.300
Abbie's just taken herself off
to the boys' room.

18:47.367 --> 18:49.400
Life is sweet.

18:53.800 --> 18:54.900
Night-night.

19:05.433 --> 19:07.167
Gutted about what Marnie said.

19:07.233 --> 19:10.267
If anything's gonna change
her mind, it's gonna be this.

19:10.333 --> 19:11.700
(groans)

19:14.533 --> 19:18.200
Abbie knows what she wants.
She wants something, she gets
it.

19:18.267 --> 19:20.400
I guess that is me done
for the night.

19:24.800 --> 19:27.167
Night, Gary. Sleep tight.

19:29.767 --> 19:32.367
(groaning)

19:44.433 --> 19:45.800
Morning, everyone.

19:45.867 --> 19:47.467
Mornin'.
Where is Abbie?

19:47.533 --> 19:50.800
It looks like Abbie
spent the night in Gary's bed
again.

19:50.867 --> 19:52.367
The horny bitch!

19:54.067 --> 19:56.500
Yes, they did.
She was saying she was tempted.

19:56.567 --> 19:59.233
Oh, my God.
I'm dying to know the verdict.

19:59.300 --> 20:00.300
I am.

20:01.300 --> 20:04.267
(yawns)
Good morning.

20:04.333 --> 20:08.333
I'm so hungover. But I'm glad
I've woken up in bed with Gary.

20:08.400 --> 20:09.700
He's a good laugh

20:09.767 --> 20:12.767
and he's got the fingers
of a pianist.

20:12.833 --> 20:15.200
You stayed the night.
I know.

20:15.267 --> 20:18.000
You surprised?
Yeah. (laughs)

20:18.067 --> 20:20.467
Abbie certainly came off
on top last night.

20:20.533 --> 20:23.433
But unfortunately,
that's the only thing that came.

20:23.500 --> 20:27.733
Every night we're getting
a step closer to the big one.

20:27.800 --> 20:31.267
Oh. Mmm. I think that could be
very far away, Gary.

20:31.333 --> 20:32.433
(laughs)

20:34.133 --> 20:35.700
You wanted to be single?

20:35.767 --> 20:38.333
I've got feelings.
She's dropped the F-bomb.

20:38.400 --> 20:41.367
I told Aaron
I didn't wanna be in a
relationship

20:41.433 --> 20:43.767
That doesn't mean
I won't in the future.

20:43.833 --> 20:46.067
It's a case of right person,
wrong time.

20:46.133 --> 20:47.767
Just not ready to...

20:47.833 --> 20:50.267
Commit.
Commit to them feelings.

20:50.333 --> 20:53.633
Wish I could tell Marnie
I wanna be girlfriend and
boyfriend.

20:53.700 --> 20:55.100
Don't wanna push her away.

20:55.167 --> 20:57.467
Hopefully she'll feel
the same way soon.

20:57.533 --> 21:00.133
We're in a good place
and we're on the same page.

21:00.200 --> 21:05.400
Which is two friends
casually enjoying each other...

21:06.500 --> 21:10.133
In the sack.
(both laugh)

21:13.667 --> 21:15.767
(splashing)
Oh! Gary!

21:16.900 --> 21:19.433
After last night,
I need to speak to Joel

21:19.500 --> 21:23.267
because I don't know
where me relationship's at.

21:23.333 --> 21:26.433
(phone rings)

21:26.500 --> 21:28.967
"Hello"
Hi, it's me.

21:29.033 --> 21:30.033
How are you?

21:34.867 --> 21:35.867
Yeah.

21:37.767 --> 21:39.400
Do you wanna come and see us?

21:43.000 --> 21:44.533
You wanna be very careful.

21:44.600 --> 21:47.300
I wasn't expecting this.
It's hurting us.

21:47.367 --> 21:49.567
I'm really frustrated.

21:49.633 --> 21:51.433
Oh, God. I can't cry.

21:51.500 --> 21:53.533
You've proved on this phone call

21:53.600 --> 21:56.900
you are gonna take everything
else as a priority apart from
me.

21:58.033 --> 21:59.133
It's fucking not on.

22:00.367 --> 22:03.800
(sobs) Find it so hard.

22:03.867 --> 22:05.033
(sobs)

22:05.100 --> 22:08.100
I don't know what the conclusion
of this phone call is.

22:10.700 --> 22:12.500
Good luck with everything, Joel.

22:12.567 --> 22:15.000
"Bye."
Bye.

22:15.067 --> 22:17.267
Someone's bothered
about other things

22:17.333 --> 22:19.133
and gonna make me second
priority

22:19.200 --> 22:21.733
then why the fuck
am I wasting my time?

22:21.800 --> 22:25.267
How'd it go?
I feel like I could kill
someone.

22:25.333 --> 22:27.167
Oh, shit.

22:27.233 --> 22:31.067
Sophie's really upset.
Things must have gone badly.

22:31.133 --> 22:34.267
He's like, "It's weird.
I don't really have a
girlfriend."

22:34.333 --> 22:36.000
I'm like, "You obviously do."

22:36.067 --> 22:38.633
He's saying he feels
he hasn't got a girlfriend,

22:38.700 --> 22:40.133
then what's he up to?

22:40.200 --> 22:42.800
No point in this conversation
and I hung up.

22:42.867 --> 22:45.533
Not being able to see
your boyfriend sucks.

22:45.600 --> 22:48.333
Must be a million times worse
when you're fighting.

22:48.400 --> 22:49.800
Gotta be there for her.

22:49.867 --> 22:53.033
Everyone's got me.
You're the shoulder of the
house.

22:53.100 --> 22:55.700
Yeah. Sometimes
a shoulder needs a shoulder.

22:55.767 --> 22:57.900
I do feel shit about me and
Joel.

22:57.967 --> 23:01.567
I've got everyone's support
so I'm gonna pull meself
together

23:01.633 --> 23:03.533
and have a good night.

23:03.600 --> 23:06.400
I'll be the shoulder
that the shoulder can cry on.

23:06.467 --> 23:08.933
I'm emotionally drained.
I'm gonna have a nap.

23:15.367 --> 23:16.833
Today's been chilled.

23:16.900 --> 23:19.100
But a chilled day
means only one thing.

23:19.167 --> 23:21.233
Tonight is gonna be a fucking
belter.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.767
Oh, you're burning up there.

23:24.833 --> 23:26.833
Marnie, are you not coming out?
Nah.

23:26.900 --> 23:28.233
I feel like shit.

23:28.300 --> 23:30.600
I just need a night by myself
to recover.

23:31.700 --> 23:32.933
See you later.
Bye.

23:36.933 --> 23:39.833
Where's Marns?
She's ill. She's not coming out.

23:39.900 --> 23:42.167
(knocking on door)
Who the fucks that?

23:42.233 --> 23:43.367
Oh, my God.

23:43.433 --> 23:45.800
Who the hell is at that door?

23:45.867 --> 23:50.100
I know Anna's an old bat, but
she
doesn't turn up this late
normally.

23:50.167 --> 23:54.567
Someone walks through the door
with a bunch of flowers,

23:54.633 --> 23:58.533
dressed in a fucking sailor
suit.

23:58.600 --> 24:01.000
Who the hell is this?

24:01.067 --> 24:03.433
(all cheer)
Oh, my God!

24:03.500 --> 24:04.733
Go!

24:04.800 --> 24:08.833
Sophie's smiling from here to
here
because she's getting cock
later.

24:08.900 --> 24:13.467
I hate that things can be so
good
but Marnie doesn't want it.

24:13.533 --> 24:15.633
I've kind of met me match.

24:16.733 --> 24:18.800
Sometimes, a girl's got needs.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.200
Gary and Abbie doing the
business?

24:22.267 --> 24:24.267
Love might not be in the air.

24:24.333 --> 24:27.267
But my farts are.
Oh, man.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.367
Geordie Shore, why-aye.

24:32.467 --> 24:32.667
.

24:35.200 --> 24:35.400
.

24:41.500 --> 24:43.467
(muttering, knocking)

24:43.533 --> 24:44.667
Who the fuck's that?

24:44.733 --> 24:46.833
There's a knock.
Who could this be?

24:46.900 --> 24:49.167
Oh, my God.

24:49.233 --> 24:51.433
(all cheer)

24:51.500 --> 24:55.433
You all right, babe?
'It's Joel. He does care after
all.'

24:55.500 --> 24:59.267
But why is he dressed
like a complete bell-end?

24:59.333 --> 25:00.667
Can't have everything.

25:00.733 --> 25:02.767
Hi everyone. You all right?
Hi, Joel.

25:02.833 --> 25:06.000
Why are you dressed like that?
Captain Joel in the building.

25:06.067 --> 25:08.933
Gonna be good. Joel's here.
Sophie's in a good mood.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.100
And Abbie is looking fit.
Winning.

25:11.167 --> 25:15.667
I'm coming to the club like
this.
You're taking that off. (all
laugh)

25:15.733 --> 25:18.767
Cheers to my lad.
(all) To Joel!

25:18.833 --> 25:21.100
Go, Joel!

25:21.167 --> 25:23.600
(dance music playing)

25:23.667 --> 25:26.867
Let's just get in the club
and get Joel fucked.

25:26.933 --> 25:28.200
(laughter)

25:29.467 --> 25:30.833
There he is.

25:30.900 --> 25:35.167
I can't believe that one person
can change my mood so much.

25:35.233 --> 25:39.833
I'm raring to go tonight.
And I'm gonna get fucking
rat-arsed.

25:44.767 --> 25:46.333
(dance music playing)

25:50.833 --> 25:53.800
I have never, ever seen
Sophie's veneers this much.

25:53.867 --> 25:57.500
She's smiling from here to here
because she's getting cock
later.

26:00.667 --> 26:04.133
All I've wanted to hear
is reassurance and he's given us
it.

26:04.200 --> 26:07.333
And he's even giving us
the horny eyes.

26:19.033 --> 26:21.433
Enough of this soppy chat with
Joel.

26:21.500 --> 26:25.600
It's time to get
this southern bastard drunk.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.500
(dance music playing)

26:35.133 --> 26:39.533
Last night, something told me
Marnie doesn't want anything
serious.

26:39.600 --> 26:42.267
Always gonna look out for Aaron.
We are brothers.

26:42.333 --> 26:44.033
I will always have his back.

26:54.500 --> 26:57.867
I am gutted knowing Marnie
doesn't wanna be in a
relationship.

26:57.933 --> 27:00.800
But knowing Gaz has got me back
is fucking amazing.

27:00.867 --> 27:03.367
(dance music playing)

27:05.167 --> 27:08.000
We are definitely on form
at the moment.

27:08.067 --> 27:09.800
Sophie's got her fella.

27:09.867 --> 27:11.700
Gary and Abbie are looking cosy.

27:11.767 --> 27:13.933
Aaron and Marnie
have never been better.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.267
And I've got my best friend
back.

27:16.333 --> 27:18.500
'I love this family.'

27:23.167 --> 27:26.367
Ease off, Joel. I love "Maaron"
too.

27:26.433 --> 27:29.633
But Marnie's not in the right
place
for them to be a couple.

27:29.700 --> 27:31.767
I just hope Aaron
isn't in too deep.

27:36.300 --> 27:39.067
Sophie's saying it's wrong time
for me and Marns.

27:39.133 --> 27:42.833
I hate that things can be so
good
but Marnie just doesn't want it.

27:42.900 --> 27:44.167
(dance music playing)

27:53.667 --> 27:57.467
I was playing hard to get last
night
And now Gary is.

28:00.100 --> 28:03.433
This is why Abbie's wicked.
Nothing serious. Having a laugh.

28:03.500 --> 28:06.067
I've kind of met me match.

28:06.133 --> 28:07.500
(dance music playing)

28:11.767 --> 28:12.900
(shouting)

28:12.967 --> 28:14.400
Let's fucking go home.

28:14.467 --> 28:16.067
We definitely got all drunk.

28:16.133 --> 28:19.867
I hope that doesn't mean
that there's no sex for me
tonight.

28:19.933 --> 28:23.367
It's time to round up the crew
and get the hell out of here.

28:26.833 --> 28:29.733
The plan tonight was to get Joel
absolutely mortal.

28:29.800 --> 28:33.933
But it's back-fired.
Now we're all so fucking pissed.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.367
Aaron! What have you done
with my boyfriend?

28:37.433 --> 28:38.867
Yeah, no comment.

28:40.167 --> 28:42.267
Stop.
(laughs)

28:42.333 --> 28:44.400
Look I've got a bucket to be
sick in.

28:44.467 --> 28:47.400
Sophie, I don't care
if he's been sick.

28:47.467 --> 28:50.500
You and Joel need
to get in that shag pad.

28:50.567 --> 28:52.533
Oh, my God.
(farts)

28:52.600 --> 28:54.633
(both laugh)
Have you just farted?

28:54.700 --> 28:56.900
(burps)
(laughs)

28:56.967 --> 28:57.967
(coughs)

28:58.033 --> 29:00.567
'This is what I love
about me and Joel.'

29:00.633 --> 29:04.300
After six years, we are more
than comfortable with each
other.

29:04.367 --> 29:07.633
Will you fart again?
You want us to fart again?

29:07.700 --> 29:09.333
Yeah.
Why?

29:09.400 --> 29:11.533
Cos it'll make me sick.
(laughs)

29:11.600 --> 29:16.167
'Love might not be
in the air but my farts are.'

29:16.233 --> 29:18.500
(farts)
Oh, my God.

29:18.567 --> 29:21.733
(groans)
(laughs)

29:21.800 --> 29:22.900
Bed.

29:29.467 --> 29:32.700
Fuck's sake. Joel, no, no, no!

29:36.467 --> 29:39.800
(chomps)
I think I'm at a restaurant.

29:41.900 --> 29:43.933
Oh, such romance, Gary.

29:44.000 --> 29:48.300
But fuck it. We've had a wicked
night
so I'm off to get into his bed.

29:52.200 --> 29:56.500
Oh, no!
(laughs) Cheese on ya pizza!

29:56.567 --> 29:59.367
Chloe, you're a twat. But I love
ya.

29:59.433 --> 30:03.033
Can't be arsed with a food fight
So I'm going to bed.

30:09.433 --> 30:11.700
There might be other people
in the room,

30:11.767 --> 30:13.667
but sometimes a girl's got
needs.

30:18.533 --> 30:21.900
In this house,
your business is my business.

30:21.967 --> 30:24.433
But are Abbie and Gary
doing the business?

30:27.267 --> 30:31.467
I'm in a wildlife documentary
with
all this going on in the same
room.

30:31.533 --> 30:34.267
Maybe I can be
the next David Attenborough.

30:34.333 --> 30:37.367
(cheers) Go on!

30:37.433 --> 30:40.300
Thanks for that, Aaron.
I was really enjoying that.

30:40.367 --> 30:41.833
(laughs)

30:41.900 --> 30:42.900
(cheers)

30:46.067 --> 30:49.900
(wretches)
Oh, my God. That was a big one.

30:59.600 --> 31:01.200
(laughs)

31:01.267 --> 31:03.267
How do you feel today?

31:03.333 --> 31:04.400
Was it bad?

31:04.467 --> 31:07.500
You were down on the floor
and you went "Fart in my face."

31:07.567 --> 31:10.133
Stop it, man.
I was like... (laughs)

31:10.200 --> 31:14.533
I might be laughing but I just
hope
he doesn't get too drunk tonight

31:14.600 --> 31:17.200
and I can finally
get a bit of action.

31:17.267 --> 31:21.000
What about... ass for breakfast!
(laughs)

31:21.067 --> 31:22.467
(both laugh)

31:25.067 --> 31:27.433
So can I ask, and be honest.
Did you shag?

31:27.500 --> 31:29.300
No. Didn't shag.
Fuck off.

31:29.367 --> 31:32.200
I swear it was just a finger,
fucking hell.

31:32.267 --> 31:35.633
It could have been more
if you hadn't interrupted,
Aaron.

31:35.700 --> 31:38.733
You're gonna push Gaz
where he's just gonna shag
someone.

31:38.800 --> 31:40.633
That's fine. He can.

31:40.700 --> 31:44.533
Never had a friend with benefits
in this house. But Abbie is
sound.

31:44.600 --> 31:46.000
I might have cracked it.

31:46.067 --> 31:50.000
I feel so much better. So I want
us
all to go on a triple date.

31:50.067 --> 31:52.600
Us four and Sophie and Joel.
Be fun.

31:52.667 --> 31:55.267
Marnie is suggesting a triple
date.

31:55.333 --> 31:58.833
Who even goes on a date
before they've shagged?

31:58.900 --> 32:01.533
You excited for it?
Yeah.

32:03.233 --> 32:05.800
Oh, my God.
What about watching them?

32:05.867 --> 32:09.700
She either got fingered
or the dick went in. Mmm-hmm.

32:09.767 --> 32:12.733
This is the third night Gary
and Abbie have shared a bed.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.667
I think they're good together.

32:14.733 --> 32:18.367
And if I get to watch through
a window, then everybody's
happy.

32:18.433 --> 32:20.633
You get any emotion when I do
this?

32:20.700 --> 32:23.200
The emotion
"I want you to get off my hand".

32:25.933 --> 32:29.167
There's nothing to cure a
hangover
better than a fry-up.

32:29.233 --> 32:32.067
I just hope that Gary
has washed his fingers.

32:32.133 --> 32:35.200
Abbie, what happened
with you and Gary last night?

32:35.267 --> 32:36.667
Oh.

32:36.733 --> 32:40.233
Can everyone stop asking what me
and Gary were doing last night?

32:40.300 --> 32:43.000
Surely it will put them off
their bacon sarnies.

32:43.067 --> 32:44.867
We watched.
What?!

32:44.933 --> 32:47.133
Why do yous always watch?
Weird as fuck.

32:47.200 --> 32:48.500
Did the willy go in?
Nah.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.100
I'm calling bullshit.

32:50.167 --> 32:52.967
Fingering. On top of the legs...
For 20 minutes?

32:53.033 --> 32:54.733
'Nathan, it didn't go in.'

32:54.800 --> 32:58.933
Wait a second. Why am I
explaining
myself to this bunch?

32:59.000 --> 33:00.233
(burps)

33:01.633 --> 33:04.567
Soph, I'm taking you out.
I've got a surprise lined up.

33:04.633 --> 33:08.367
My God. This is one of the most
romantic things he has ever
said.

33:08.433 --> 33:10.767
I hope to God it's not shit.

33:10.833 --> 33:12.433
Act excited then.
I am. I am.

33:12.500 --> 33:14.900
What do you want me to do?
Go wahey?!

33:14.967 --> 33:16.300
(all laugh)
Surprise!

33:17.867 --> 33:19.767
Operation get mortal!

33:19.833 --> 33:20.867
(all) Cheers.

33:20.933 --> 33:22.867
Impossible not to get feelings.

33:22.933 --> 33:25.800
Maybe you should be worried
about Aaron's feelings.

33:25.867 --> 33:28.500
I wouldn't mind getting
into your bed later.

33:28.567 --> 33:31.133
Don't say you'll fuck me mates.
It's weird.

33:31.200 --> 33:33.867
If he's drunk or not,
that's out of order. Fuck off.

33:33.933 --> 33:36.567
She wanted to be single
(glass shattering)

33:36.633 --> 33:38.333
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye.

33:41.933 --> 33:42.133
.

33:44.667 --> 33:44.867
.

33:59.567 --> 34:01.967
Make sure you spoil me girl.
Have fun.

34:02.033 --> 34:06.067
I'm really excited. I don't know
what
I'm doing, or where I'm going.

34:06.133 --> 34:07.867
I hope that it's really special.

34:13.100 --> 34:16.199
You ready?
What for? (mumbles)

34:16.266 --> 34:19.733
Me and Joel get out the taxi
and we're at an old bridge

34:19.800 --> 34:23.199
There's bird poo all over.
How the fuck is this romantic?

34:23.266 --> 34:25.333
You ever heard
of the love lock bridge?

34:25.400 --> 34:29.100
Oh, right. Oh, my God,
this is actually really cute.

34:29.167 --> 34:32.533
Got one in Paris, Amsterdam
and this is the Newcastle
version.

34:32.600 --> 34:36.333
What the hell? This is so
magical.

34:36.400 --> 34:38.567
Shall we write a "Soel"
big there as well.

34:38.632 --> 34:40.467
Writing a "T".
Hold on a minute.

34:40.533 --> 34:43.067
It's an "L".
You can't fucking spell. It's
"L".

34:43.132 --> 34:45.833
This has made me realise how
special
I am to Joel.

34:45.900 --> 34:51.033
I am grinning from ear to ear.
He definitely loves us.

34:51.100 --> 34:53.433
You like it?
Thank you. Very romantic.

34:53.500 --> 34:54.567
Love you.
Mmm.

34:59.767 --> 35:01.700
(cheering)

35:01.767 --> 35:03.367
Sophie and Joel are back

35:03.433 --> 35:06.633
and I know them two
will be well up for triple
dates.

35:06.700 --> 35:10.500
"Gabbie", "Maaron" and "Soel"
are all going on a triple...

35:10.567 --> 35:12.833
And what's Chlothan gonna do?
(all laugh)

35:12.900 --> 35:14.533
Hello! You're forgetting us.

35:14.600 --> 35:17.233
I beg your fucking pardon.

35:17.300 --> 35:19.867
Going on a date
and leaving me and Chloe behind?

35:19.933 --> 35:22.633
We're more of a couple
than any of yous fucks.

35:22.700 --> 35:24.967
(giggles)
(laughs)

35:27.367 --> 35:29.000
I'm really excited.

35:29.067 --> 35:31.400
I've never been
on a triple date before.

35:31.467 --> 35:34.633
And we're going
to my dad's restaurant.

35:34.700 --> 35:37.467
This is gonna be great.

35:37.533 --> 35:38.800
Joel's getting on it.

35:38.867 --> 35:41.467
Get same drunk as last night.
Gotta go one better.

35:45.400 --> 35:47.600
Got me a Maccy's the morning
after.

35:47.667 --> 35:49.533
Wow. Fucking hell.
(laughs)

35:49.600 --> 35:52.100
I've never been on a date
like this before.

35:52.167 --> 35:53.800
So I don't know what to expect.

35:53.867 --> 35:57.500
I'm buzzing to get
some fancy food and champagne.

36:00.733 --> 36:03.200
We're getting a Mambos
and it's so beautiful.

36:03.267 --> 36:04.933
This is nice.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.600
Gonna be the best triple date
I've ever been on.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.967
I feel like everyone came
single.

36:11.033 --> 36:13.600
Now we're coupled up.
When did this happen?

36:13.667 --> 36:15.567
Right now are you not exclusive?

36:15.633 --> 36:17.700
Are you mad? Relax.
(laughs)

36:17.767 --> 36:20.567
Joel, take your foot
out of your mouth.

36:20.633 --> 36:22.467
You're gonna scare Gary off

36:22.533 --> 36:25.433
if you're using words
like "exclusive".

36:25.500 --> 36:28.433
If yous generally continue the
way
that yous are going,

36:28.500 --> 36:31.367
it's gonna be impossible
not to get feelings.

36:31.433 --> 36:32.533
Right.

36:32.600 --> 36:35.633
Why you worried about
me and Abbie catching feelings?

36:35.700 --> 36:38.433
You should be worried
about Aaron's feelings.

36:38.500 --> 36:40.933
Somebody is gonna get hurt.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.267
So...

36:42.333 --> 36:45.467
...what we thinking?
Boyfriend and girlfriend?

36:45.533 --> 36:48.533
If it happens, we'll have
to be in the right frame of
mind.

36:48.600 --> 36:51.400
Not me wanting more than her.
We both need to want it.

36:51.467 --> 36:53.933
I wish I could be honest.
I wanna give it a go.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.833
But she wants to be single.
So it's lose-lose for me.

36:57.900 --> 37:00.167
Cheers, everyone.
Best triple date ever!

37:00.233 --> 37:01.567
(all laugh)
Cheers!

37:04.033 --> 37:07.067
Chloe, get that off your vagina.
It's not on me vagina.

37:07.133 --> 37:09.933
It doesn't matter if it's me
and Nathan in the house

37:10.000 --> 37:11.867
We just need each other to have
fun.

37:11.933 --> 37:15.200
I'm gonna be on the maddest one
ever.
One, two, three. Go.

37:18.067 --> 37:22.200
Me and Chloe are gonna do
exactly
what we do best and get pissed.

37:22.267 --> 37:23.867
To having the best night ever.

37:25.867 --> 37:29.600
Everyone can fuck off
with a poxy meal and a triple
date.

37:29.667 --> 37:32.433
Me and Nathan are gonna have
the best night ever.

37:33.500 --> 37:37.567
My fair lady, your carriage
awaits.
Why thank you, my young chap
friend.

37:41.333 --> 37:42.567
Me and you on a date.

37:45.467 --> 37:48.800
We get to the club.
It's literally just the two of
us.

37:50.633 --> 37:53.833
Fuck it, Nathan.
Operation get mortal!

38:03.467 --> 38:07.500
We've arrived at the club. I'm
so
excited that tomorrow is my
birthday

38:07.567 --> 38:09.467
and we're having a house party.

38:09.533 --> 38:12.333
But that doesn't mean
we can't get started early.

38:12.400 --> 38:14.233
(cheers)

38:14.300 --> 38:17.533
(both laugh)

38:17.600 --> 38:21.067
We get to the club. These two
fuckers are having a lovely
time.

38:21.133 --> 38:22.900
I bet they missed us really.

38:26.833 --> 38:28.700
(all) Cheers!

38:28.767 --> 38:32.033
The clock has struck midnight.
That means it's me birthday.

38:32.100 --> 38:34.067
Time to get fucking smashed.

38:45.333 --> 38:47.933
This is the best I've ever seen
Marnie and Aaron.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.467
They are getting on so well.

38:49.533 --> 38:51.867
Let's hope this time
they make it official.

38:55.767 --> 38:59.633
This party is gonna be so
special.
I've invited all me friends.

38:59.700 --> 39:02.567
'I can't wait to celebrate
Aaron's birthday.'

39:02.633 --> 39:05.100
(dance music playing)

39:29.333 --> 39:32.267
Get over yourself, Gary.
I don't want a relationship.

39:32.333 --> 39:35.033
But I wouldn't mind getting
into your bed later.

39:43.067 --> 39:45.200
You can tell
that it's Aarons birthday

39:45.267 --> 39:48.800
because he's on
another fucking level.

39:48.867 --> 39:51.067
I hope he doesn't get Joel
as drunk as him.

39:54.767 --> 39:58.200
Not gonna lie, I'm fucking
wasted.
Time to hit the dancefloor.

40:00.500 --> 40:02.300
Neck it, neck it!

40:06.800 --> 40:10.233
'The birthday boy
is officially fucked.'

40:10.300 --> 40:15.467
So it's time to head back
to the house to continue the
party!

40:15.533 --> 40:17.267
It's my birthday, yes!

40:19.067 --> 40:22.300
Was a joke. Made a joke.
(laughs) Joel's creased.

40:24.467 --> 40:27.000
It was mint celebrating
Aaron's birthday.

40:27.067 --> 40:29.500
Tomorrow we're having
a massive house party.

40:29.567 --> 40:32.067
And I am planning on letting
loose.

40:32.133 --> 40:35.033
Marnie, you got any fit mates
at this house party?

40:42.500 --> 40:44.000
Am I hearing things?

40:44.067 --> 40:47.067
Aaron wants to sleep with one
of me friends at the party?

40:47.133 --> 40:49.533
Drunk or not, that's out of
order.

40:49.600 --> 40:52.567
Don't say you'll fuck
one of me mates. Weird.

40:53.833 --> 40:55.300
Can't she tell I'm joking?

40:55.367 --> 40:59.800
She wanted to be single.
So I don't know why she's
annoyed.

40:59.867 --> 41:01.867
Truth comes out when you're
drunk.

41:01.933 --> 41:05.400
Are you fucking...
Aaron, don't. Aaron, don't.

41:05.467 --> 41:06.633
(thumping)
Aaron!

41:06.700 --> 41:09.033
Fuck. Aaron's just punched
a taxi window.

41:09.100 --> 41:10.933
I knew it would kick off.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.733
He's been keeping
all his feelings hidden.

41:13.800 --> 41:15.967
Now all the emotion's
just coming out.

41:16.033 --> 41:18.767
Fuck off.
'What's Aaron playing at?'

41:18.833 --> 41:22.767
Everything's been amazing until
now.
I don't care if it's his
birthday.

41:22.833 --> 41:25.433
After what he said,
I don't even wanna look at him.

41:32.867 --> 41:35.633
We get back to the house
and everybody's a bit shocked

41:35.700 --> 41:37.600
as to what the fuck is going on.

41:38.967 --> 41:41.867
I don't argue with Aaron,
especially when he's drunk.

41:41.933 --> 41:45.400
Gonna put meself to bed
before this escalates further.

41:52.300 --> 41:54.267
'I've got back home. It's hit
us.'

41:54.333 --> 41:57.133
Ruined me birthday
and my relationship with Marnie.

41:57.200 --> 41:59.033
What a fucking idiot.

41:59.100 --> 42:01.767
(glass smashing)
Aaron!

42:01.833 --> 42:05.467
Smashing up the house?
Aaron is such a big baby.

42:05.533 --> 42:07.467
For fuck's sake. Grow up.

42:09.300 --> 42:11.300
I hate seeing Aaron like this.

42:11.367 --> 42:13.767
Things weren't as cool
as what he was saying.

42:13.833 --> 42:16.100
I'm always gonna be here
for my best mate.

42:16.167 --> 42:19.900
Go to A&E, sort your hand out.
Get back here as quick as
possible.

42:19.967 --> 42:22.433
I'm gutted I've ruined
everyone's night.

42:22.500 --> 42:25.767
And what makes it worse,
I'm going to A&E on me birthday.

42:25.833 --> 42:26.933
What a dickhead.

42:28.067 --> 42:29.200
No kicking things.

42:33.700 --> 42:36.400
Tonight has been eventful
to say the least.

42:36.467 --> 42:40.067
Do you know what? I am
knackered.
I am going to bed.

42:43.400 --> 42:45.633
Why do I build me hopes up
for Aaron?

42:45.700 --> 42:49.333
I honestly thought he'd changed.
Has he, fuck.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.800
This is why I've been saying
I wanna be single

42:51.867 --> 42:53.500
and not get in a relationship.

42:53.567 --> 42:56.167
He's never gonna be the
boyfriend
I want him to be.

42:56.233 --> 42:58.033
I hate that we've ended like
this.

43:05.400 --> 43:07.567
The only person I care about is
you.

43:07.633 --> 43:10.233
Hope I haven't ruined it
with one stupid mistake.

43:10.300 --> 43:12.733
Let's have a fucking house
party!

43:13.967 --> 43:16.233
(cheering)

43:16.300 --> 43:17.300
Happy birthday!

43:17.367 --> 43:18.900
Wah! Wah!

43:20.233 --> 43:22.367
What the hell am I even doing?

43:22.433 --> 43:24.333
Feel like a baby seal. I can't
stop.

43:24.400 --> 43:27.733
(all) It's all about the
pulling,
It's on.

43:27.800 --> 43:30.700
Not slippery nipples, are they?

43:30.767 --> 43:33.767
She likes Gary
more than what she's leading on.

43:33.833 --> 43:35.067
Thank you.

43:36.300 --> 43:39.500
Fuck. Did I just hear
what I think I just heard?

44:07.900 --> 44:08.100
.
