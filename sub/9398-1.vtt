00:02.702 --> 00:05.466
Help! Help me! Haley!

00:05.638 --> 00:06.866
Oh, God!

00:08.007 --> 00:11.136
Nathan! Cooper!

00:11.211 --> 00:12.701
Nathan!

00:13.246 --> 00:14.645
Help!

00:15.415 --> 00:18.509
Somebody, please help!

00:27.527 --> 00:29.722
<i>My name is Lucas Scott.</i>

00:30.130 --> 00:32.723
<i>I'm a senior at Tree Hill High School.</i>

00:34.367 --> 00:37.530
<i>Tree Hill is just a place</i>
<i>somewhere in the world.</i>

00:37.971 --> 00:40.303
<i>Maybe it's a lot like your world.</i>

00:40.373 --> 00:42.364
<i>Maybe it's nothing like it.</i>

00:43.376 --> 00:45.367
<i>But if you look closer,</i>

00:46.746 --> 00:48.941
<i>you might see someone like you.</i>

00:50.750 --> 00:53.344
<i>Or someone like my best friend, Haley.</i>

00:55.455 --> 00:58.083
<i>If you're married, a senior in high school</i>

00:58.158 --> 01:00.991
<i>and not sure if your husband's still alive,</i>

01:01.661 --> 01:04.653
<i>then I'd say your world is a lot like Haley's.</i>

01:05.965 --> 01:09.162
<i>Today was supposed</i>
<i>to be the best day of her life.</i>

01:09.469 --> 01:12.836
<i>But it's amazing how things</i>
<i>can change in the blink of an eye</i>

01:13.339 --> 01:17.537
<i>or, in this case, in about 29 minutes.</i>

01:24.584 --> 01:25.642
What?

01:25.718 --> 01:28.881
I can't believe that Rachel got drunk
and stole our wedding limo.

01:28.955 --> 01:31.515
I can't believe your
uncle Cooper slept with Rachel.

01:31.591 --> 01:34.253
She's 17. What is he, like 30?

01:34.327 --> 01:38.354
He must not have known.
I mean, he couldn't have known, right?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.594
When we slept together that night,
you knew I was 17.

01:43.670 --> 01:45.831
Rachel, enough.

01:47.307 --> 01:50.902
Maybe it could work, Cooper. You know?
We're good together.

01:50.977 --> 01:52.672
Maybe the age difference doesn't matter.

01:52.745 --> 01:54.872
It does matter, all right?

01:55.815 --> 01:56.873
Now, listen to me.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.679
We're gonna take this limousine
back to the reception,

01:58.751 --> 02:01.982
and then you and I never happened.

02:03.656 --> 02:07.387
Isn't there anything
I can say to keep you, Cooper?

02:07.494 --> 02:10.088
No, I'm sorry, there's not.

02:12.031 --> 02:13.965
Well, that's too bad.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.835
Because there's something
I have to tell you.

02:19.706 --> 02:21.173
I'm pregnant.

02:24.277 --> 02:26.040
I don't believe you.

02:27.847 --> 02:28.973
Pull over.

02:29.048 --> 02:31.448
No, I'm not letting you out of this car
until we talk about this.

02:31.518 --> 02:34.043
- I said, "Pull over!"
- No! You don't just tell me... Hey!

02:41.995 --> 02:43.257
Look out!

03:10.456 --> 03:14.324
- That was Cooper. Cooper!
- Cooper!

03:15.261 --> 03:18.992
- Haley, call 911.
- Nathan, don't.

03:20.567 --> 03:22.194
I love you.

03:22.635 --> 03:23.795
Don't.

03:25.772 --> 03:26.966
Nathan!

03:31.144 --> 03:34.272
Nathan! Nathan!

04:10.883 --> 04:14.683
Oh, God, help me!

04:15.455 --> 04:18.356
Help, please!

04:18.591 --> 04:20.491
Oh, stop! Stop!

04:20.892 --> 04:22.292
Oh, Luke!

04:22.829 --> 04:24.057
What happened?

04:24.130 --> 04:26.121
The limousine with Cooper
went over the bridge,

04:26.199 --> 04:27.996
and then Nathan jumped over,

04:28.067 --> 04:30.797
and he hasn't come up
for a really long time.

04:32.572 --> 04:34.904
- Nathan!
- Oh, God.

04:34.974 --> 04:36.305
Nathan!

04:37.877 --> 04:39.071
Lucas!

04:47.820 --> 04:50.118
- Did you call 911?
- I did! I called them!

04:50.189 --> 04:52.020
Help him, Luke!

04:58.564 --> 05:00.395
Nathan!

05:04.370 --> 05:05.769
It's Cooper!

05:22.388 --> 05:25.084
- I can't find them!
- What?

05:25.358 --> 05:26.757
I can't find them!

05:26.826 --> 05:30.489
- What do you mean? He's down there.
- No, the car is empty.

05:31.497 --> 05:32.794
Nathan!

05:33.066 --> 05:34.465
Nathan!

05:37.103 --> 05:39.003
Nathan!

06:25.385 --> 06:27.012
I can't find him!

06:27.520 --> 06:29.784
- Nathan!
- Nathan!

06:29.856 --> 06:31.050
Nathan!

06:34.927 --> 06:36.292
Haley, don't look.

06:36.362 --> 06:39.354
Oh, God! Nathan!

06:47.440 --> 06:52.503
<i>Things that take 14 minutes.</i>
<i>Boiling an ostrich egg,</i>

06:52.578 --> 06:55.069
<i>Michael Jackson's</i> Thriller <i>video.</i>

06:55.148 --> 06:57.844
<i>It also takes 14 minutes</i>
<i>to get from the Molina Bridge</i>

06:57.917 --> 06:59.782
<i>to Tree Hill Hospital.</i>

07:00.253 --> 07:04.383
<i>In those 14 minutes,</i>
<i>three lives hung in the balance.</i>

07:05.191 --> 07:08.558
<i>For the rest of us,</i>
<i>there was nothing to do but wait.</i>

07:09.095 --> 07:11.655
<i>I guess that's why they call it</i>
<i>the waiting room.</i>

07:11.731 --> 07:13.722
Someone should call Dan.

07:15.234 --> 07:19.728
<i>Dan Scott is many things.</i>
<i>The mayor of Tree Hill,</i>

07:20.306 --> 07:25.642
<i>a once-great high school basketball player,</i>
<i>and Nathan's father.</i>

07:26.078 --> 07:29.013
<i>He's also my father,</i>
<i>but he never claimed me.</i>

07:29.315 --> 07:32.614
<i>Believe it or not,</i>
<i>I got the better end of the deal.</i>

07:33.753 --> 07:38.019
<i>I was instead raised by my mom</i>
<i>with help from my Uncle Keith.</i>

07:38.958 --> 07:41.153
<i>Until Keith's life was taken.</i>

07:42.061 --> 07:45.030
<i>You are no longer my brother,</i>
<i>you son of a bitch.</i>

07:54.006 --> 07:55.701
<i>You do not exist to me.</i>

08:16.762 --> 08:18.491
Hey, any news, Mom?

08:23.402 --> 08:26.030
We need to talk about this pregnancy.

08:26.606 --> 08:28.096
Keith would be so happy.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.766
I can't believe you're having his baby.

08:29.842 --> 08:32.366
I'm not talking about that pregnancy.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.273
Whose test did you find at the reception?

08:36.349 --> 08:39.614
- Was it Brooke's?
- I'm not sure yet.

08:40.486 --> 08:41.544
I'm your mother, Lucas.

08:41.621 --> 08:44.111
And considering that I was pregnant at 17,

08:44.190 --> 08:46.886
I just want to know
if history is repeating itself

08:46.959 --> 08:49.189
with my son and his girlfriend.

08:50.897 --> 08:52.489
Nathan's awake.

09:04.877 --> 09:08.836
So, what, the wedding wasn't enough?
You needed even more attention?

09:09.248 --> 09:10.840
Thank you, Luke.

09:11.317 --> 09:14.878
- For what?
- For saving my life.

09:15.288 --> 09:18.985
I just got Cooper to shore, man.
You're the one who saved everybody.

09:19.492 --> 09:21.255
You're a hero, Nate.

09:27.433 --> 09:28.661
Help me!

09:30.002 --> 09:31.162
Haley!

09:50.089 --> 09:55.721
If I say I love you,
will you hold it against me?

09:56.362 --> 10:00.423
<i>Brooke, I think</i>
<i>I still have feelings for Lucas.</i>

10:01.701 --> 10:04.864
You're a backstabbing,
two-faced bitch, Peyton.

10:04.937 --> 10:08.134
As far as I am concerned,
this friendship is over.

10:08.541 --> 10:12.875
And if we never speak again
for the rest of our lives, that'll be fine.

11:04.063 --> 11:07.055
It looks like I'm not the only one
who knows you killed me.

11:07.133 --> 11:09.966
Shut up, you little smart-ass ghost.

11:19.045 --> 11:22.606
Nope. I'm definitely not
the only one who knows.

11:33.125 --> 11:34.922
Someone's in trouble.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.572
Mayor Scott, it's the police.

11:53.646 --> 11:55.375
I'll be there in a second.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.009
Afternoon, gentlemen.

12:01.654 --> 12:03.679
You caught me red-handed.

12:04.690 --> 12:08.091
Sorry to bother you, Mayor,
but your son's had an accident.

12:10.096 --> 12:11.688
Which one?

12:13.399 --> 12:16.698
Mayor Scott, do you know
how badly hurt your son is?

12:16.769 --> 12:18.634
Mayor, will this affect
his basketball career?

12:18.704 --> 12:20.899
Look, I appreciate concern
for Nathan, but right now,

12:20.973 --> 12:23.840
I'm just a worried father
who needs to see his son.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.140
- Luke.
- Hey, Skills.

12:31.217 --> 12:32.809
What's up, man?
Bevin heard about the accident.

12:32.885 --> 12:35.410
- How are Nathan and Haley doing?
- I think they'll be okay.

12:35.488 --> 12:38.457
- Cool. How about you?
- I'm fine.

12:38.524 --> 12:39.855
You sure about that?

12:39.925 --> 12:43.019
'Cause Bevin heard you and Brooke
had a little friction at the wedding.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.154
Man, you know Bevin
be hearing things, dawg.

12:45.231 --> 12:49.600
Look, Brooke kind of found out
that I kissed Peyton again.

12:49.668 --> 12:50.862
Wow.

12:51.537 --> 12:55.803
Well, it's a good thing you in the hospital,
'cause your sorry ass in bad shape, bro.

12:55.875 --> 12:57.672
Thanks. It was the school shooting.

12:57.743 --> 13:01.543
Peyton was scared.
She kissed me, and I let her.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.606
Well, look, just in case
Brooke decides to show up,

13:04.683 --> 13:07.618
I don't want to be standing
too close to you.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.620
But, look, if you need something,
dawg, call me.

13:11.157 --> 13:12.818
Same go for Haley.

13:12.892 --> 13:14.189
Lucas.

13:15.494 --> 13:18.224
And try not to make out with her, please.

13:19.565 --> 13:23.467
- Hey, how's Nathan? Is he okay?
- Yeah. I think so. He's awake.

13:23.536 --> 13:26.232
Rachel and Cooper are still unconscious.

13:27.006 --> 13:28.337
I'm sorry.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.776
<i>Peyton Sawyer is a good friend.</i>

13:38.217 --> 13:40.742
<i>Brooke Davis is my girlfriend.</i>

13:43.222 --> 13:45.315
<i>At least for now she is.</i>

13:59.572 --> 14:00.664
Slut.

14:02.408 --> 14:03.568
Bitch.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.169
Whore.

14:09.315 --> 14:12.011
Well, I know I'm not in heaven,

14:12.685 --> 14:15.848
'cause they'd never let Brooke Davis'
skanky ass through the gates.

14:15.921 --> 14:20.119
And your ass wouldn't fit,
at least not the old one.

14:22.027 --> 14:25.224
- How are you?
- Is Cooper okay?

14:26.765 --> 14:28.790
I don't know, I'm sorry.

14:30.135 --> 14:32.330
Do you remember what happened?

14:33.205 --> 14:34.763
We were arguing.

14:34.840 --> 14:36.205
About what?

14:39.812 --> 14:41.837
I told him I was pregnant.

14:45.251 --> 14:46.616
But I lied.

14:48.387 --> 14:52.380
I'm not pregnant.
I just wanted to scare him.

14:56.729 --> 14:57.923
Brooke.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.832
I tried to call you.

15:06.272 --> 15:09.139
Yeah, I know.
I came as soon as I got your voice mail.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.005
I'm glad you're okay.

15:12.478 --> 15:15.936
So, look, after you left the reception,
I found your purse and...

15:16.515 --> 15:18.881
It had a pregnancy test in it.

15:20.219 --> 15:23.017
We all got the same purse
as wedding gifts.

15:23.088 --> 15:26.387
It had that perfume you wear.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.630
Look, the test wasn't...

15:35.267 --> 15:38.930
I'm not pregnant, okay? I promise.

15:44.443 --> 15:46.206
How are you feeling?

15:47.713 --> 15:50.841
- I just want to go home.
- Yeah, sure. I understand.

15:51.183 --> 15:52.480
How about you, Haley?

15:52.551 --> 15:54.746
Not exactly the honeymoon you planned.

15:54.820 --> 15:57.015
It's okay. London can wait.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.317
How's the knee, Doc?

15:59.391 --> 16:02.326
Oh, it'll be fine,
just sore for a couple of days.

16:02.394 --> 16:04.794
I'd like to run a couple of tests,
if you don't mind.

16:04.863 --> 16:06.125
Yeah.

16:11.236 --> 16:13.534
Deb, do you have a minute?

16:19.611 --> 16:21.511
We haven't exactly

16:21.580 --> 16:25.311
got a chance to talk
about your confession, have we, ex-wifey?

16:25.384 --> 16:27.944
You tried to kill me in the dealership fire.

16:28.020 --> 16:31.820
Go ahead, scream for someone
to enforce your little restraining order.

16:32.124 --> 16:34.456
What? I can't hear you.

16:34.927 --> 16:38.556
- You son of a bitch.
- No, no, that would be Nathan.

16:38.630 --> 16:40.222
You see, he's the son. You're the bitch.

16:40.299 --> 16:43.029
- You listen to me.
- No, you listen to me.

16:44.536 --> 16:47.130
You don't know the hell
you unleashed when you blew it,

16:47.206 --> 16:49.003
and now it's my turn.

16:50.109 --> 16:52.009
So you be afraid, Deb.

16:52.478 --> 16:54.241
Be more than afraid.

17:06.325 --> 17:09.317
- Hales, I can get those.
- It's okay. I've got it.

17:13.265 --> 17:15.961
I was gonna surprise you
when we got back.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.935
It's the London Bridge.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.036
Thank you.

17:22.741 --> 17:25.141
It's probably a good thing we didn't go.

17:25.778 --> 17:29.441
I mean, the wedding wasn't cheap.
Now we've got new furniture to pay for,

17:29.515 --> 17:30.948
and I can't wait to get those hospital bills,

17:31.016 --> 17:34.076
especially considering
we don't have insurance.

17:40.526 --> 17:43.723
<i>Oh, God! Haley!</i>

17:48.600 --> 17:51.296
It's okay. You're safe. You're home now.

17:57.042 --> 17:58.202
Hey...

17:58.677 --> 18:00.372
Before the accident,

18:00.446 --> 18:03.506
there was something
that you wanted to tell me.

18:04.883 --> 18:06.976
I got accepted to Stanford.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.554
Well, I'm happy for you, Hales.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.862
Even though
we just spent your tuition money.

18:18.497 --> 18:22.263
It's all right. We'll figure something out.
As long as we're together.

18:27.573 --> 18:29.165
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:29.708 --> 18:30.970
Everything okay?

18:31.043 --> 18:34.809
Yeah, Nathan's home, and Rachel's awake.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.713
We're just waiting on Cooper.

18:37.783 --> 18:40.775
- Looking for Brooke?
- Sort of, yeah.

18:40.853 --> 18:44.152
I saw her at the hospital, and she said
that she kind of went off on you.

18:44.223 --> 18:45.622
Oh, yeah.

18:45.691 --> 18:48.216
She pretty much told me
to go Brooke myself.

18:48.293 --> 18:49.920
I'm sorry, Peyton.

18:49.995 --> 18:51.929
I mean, I didn't think
that kiss meant anything,

18:51.997 --> 18:54.864
but apparently to Brooke
it meant everything.

18:54.933 --> 18:59.893
She didn't say anything else,
did she, about me or us?

19:00.672 --> 19:02.003
Like what?

19:04.209 --> 19:05.437
Nothing.

19:06.512 --> 19:08.480
Is that letter from her?

19:08.947 --> 19:10.414
Actually, no.

19:11.617 --> 19:15.576
You remember when Ellie came to town
and told me she was my birth mother?

19:16.288 --> 19:17.619
It's happening again.

19:17.689 --> 19:20.157
- Wait, you have a third mother?
- No.

19:20.926 --> 19:22.416
Not exactly.

19:30.269 --> 19:31.497
Where did you get this?

19:31.570 --> 19:34.801
From an album she left,
one of her favorites.

19:35.507 --> 19:38.840
- Lf this is true...
- Yeah.

19:41.079 --> 19:43.206
Apparently, I have a brother.

19:55.327 --> 19:56.794
I'm so sorry.

19:59.565 --> 20:01.965
I understand you were inebriated.

20:02.901 --> 20:05.335
Several witnesses say you...

20:05.904 --> 20:08.429
You made a bit of a scene at the reception.

20:09.007 --> 20:11.498
Said you were pretty upset with him.

20:11.643 --> 20:14.544
Now, when you're up to it,

20:14.613 --> 20:17.776
we're gonna need to take your statement
about what happened on that bridge.

20:17.849 --> 20:21.683
I'm especially interested
to hear how a professional driver

20:21.753 --> 20:25.712
could just lose control
of a vehicle like that.

20:26.058 --> 20:30.586
I mean, I have my theory,
but for your sake,

20:31.597 --> 20:35.192
you better hope he wakes up
and tells me that I'm wrong.

20:44.743 --> 20:47.610
Smell that, Fergie? It smells like...

20:48.680 --> 20:52.639
Oh, a basket by Skills
and a visit by Lucas Scott.

20:52.718 --> 20:53.980
Both rare occurrences.

20:54.052 --> 20:56.748
Hey, yo, Mouth,
stay off the crack pipe, dawg.

20:57.723 --> 20:59.190
- What's up, baby?
- Good, brother.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.749
- How's Nate?
- He'll be okay.

21:01.827 --> 21:03.488
What about Rachel?

21:03.595 --> 21:05.563
You haven't seen her yet?

21:06.331 --> 21:10.062
I think she'll be okay.
No word on Cooper yet, though.

21:11.570 --> 21:13.868
- So, look, I got a favor to ask you.
- Yeah, anything.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.601
All right, I was kind of thinking
about trying to go to college,

21:16.675 --> 21:18.575
but money kind of tight right now.

21:18.644 --> 21:20.407
Anyway, I know you had to leave the team

21:20.479 --> 21:22.640
because of your heart condition
and all that,

21:22.714 --> 21:26.810
but I was thinking maybe the Ravens
could use another shooting guard.

21:26.885 --> 21:28.614
You want to join the Ravens?

21:28.687 --> 21:30.518
If it's gonna get me a scholarship.

21:30.589 --> 21:33.683
I mean, look, I know it's a long shot,
but you never know.

21:33.759 --> 21:36.057
They might actually
make a run in the post-season,

21:36.128 --> 21:38.995
and somebody might actually
get to see me play.

21:39.064 --> 21:41.498
You know, a small D2, juco, whatever.

21:41.566 --> 21:44.364
Just wondered
if you could talk to Whitey for me.

21:44.436 --> 21:45.596
Absolutely.

21:45.671 --> 21:47.332
Now, look, I just want a tryout, dawg.

21:47.406 --> 21:49.931
I'm not asking for no special treatment
or nothing. Just a chance.

21:50.008 --> 21:52.169
I hear you, man. I was there.
I'll talk to Whitey.

21:52.244 --> 21:54.212
Cool. Good looking out.

22:42.728 --> 22:43.888
May I?

22:45.464 --> 22:46.931
How's Nathan?

22:48.300 --> 22:51.565
I don't know, really.
You'd have to ask my ex-wife.

22:52.704 --> 22:54.467
Whose fault is that?

22:55.273 --> 22:56.968
Yeah, fair enough.

22:58.410 --> 22:59.775
And Cooper?

23:01.513 --> 23:03.140
Cooper would be better off
if he died in his sleep.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.910
Every time that immature punk
comes to town,

23:04.983 --> 23:07.213
my son ends up in the hospital.

23:10.789 --> 23:12.780
Hopefully, he'll be okay.

23:14.526 --> 23:20.226
Karen, would it be the strangest of things
if we got a cup of coffee sometime?

23:20.832 --> 23:22.959
I've given up coffee
through my pregnancy.

23:23.034 --> 23:25.025
- A movie, then?
- No.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.997
You've given up movies, too?

23:28.140 --> 23:30.665
No, I just don't want to go with you.

23:32.944 --> 23:34.741
Karen, I...

23:35.680 --> 23:36.738
I just...

23:38.083 --> 23:40.176
I want to be there for you.

23:40.786 --> 23:42.413
I know I wasn't there for you and Lucas.

23:42.487 --> 23:46.116
But you shouldn't have to raise
another child on your own.

23:47.592 --> 23:51.119
I didn't raise Lucas alone. I had Keith.

23:57.636 --> 24:00.366
<i>The car crashed through the guardrail</i>
<i>and was completely submerged...</i>

24:06.445 --> 24:07.605
Hello?

24:09.214 --> 24:11.079
I'm sorry, no comment.

24:15.754 --> 24:19.121
Why do all the hardest days
seem to last the longest?

24:20.792 --> 24:24.853
Is it possible we only renewed
our wedding vows this morning?

24:24.930 --> 24:27.160
It feels like another life ago.

24:31.570 --> 24:32.628
Hey.

24:35.607 --> 24:38.508
What happened down there at the river?

24:39.511 --> 24:41.103
Can you tell me?

24:55.193 --> 24:56.660
I don't know.

24:57.863 --> 24:59.888
It's gonna be okay, Nathan.

25:00.999 --> 25:03.467
Everything's gonna be okay.

25:03.935 --> 25:05.994
I don't think so, Haley.

25:06.905 --> 25:10.341
Today, for the first time in a long time,

25:12.177 --> 25:15.203
it doesn't feel
like anything's gonna be okay.

25:23.522 --> 25:26.753
Code blue, Trauma 3. Code blue, Trauma 3.

25:27.826 --> 25:31.227
Nathan, you're a hero.

25:31.296 --> 25:33.696
You did everything that you could.

25:35.867 --> 25:39.826
Code blue. Cardiac arrest.
Pulse rapidly descending.

25:41.573 --> 25:42.733
Did I?

25:52.083 --> 25:53.710
We're losing him.

26:05.764 --> 26:07.959
Let's have a high dose of epi.

26:09.167 --> 26:11.362
Prepare to defibrillate.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.098
Clear.

26:16.341 --> 26:17.740
No response.

26:17.809 --> 26:20.334
Push one of atropine.
I'm gonna hit him again.

26:20.412 --> 26:21.777
Clear.

26:24.349 --> 26:27.807
BP 100 systolic. Pulse ox rising.

26:48.173 --> 26:50.505
He should have been awake by now.

26:55.046 --> 26:57.446
They told me Nathan saved my life.

26:59.050 --> 27:00.381
How is he?

27:01.219 --> 27:02.550
How is he?

27:04.789 --> 27:07.917
He's devastated, Rachel,
and it's all your fault.

27:07.993 --> 27:10.120
- Haley.
- I saw you in the limo with Cooper.

27:10.195 --> 27:11.628
You were arguing with him, weren't you?

27:11.696 --> 27:14.631
- It wasn't what it looked like.
- You ruined everything.

27:14.699 --> 27:18.226
You caused a huge scene at the reception.
You stole the limo.

27:18.303 --> 27:21.466
And now everybody's life
is worse because of you.

27:23.041 --> 27:25.737
Does it even matter to you a little bit?

27:26.111 --> 27:29.410
Are you gonna change
one single thing because of it?

27:30.615 --> 27:33.516
Nathan doesn't need your thanks.
Neither do I.

27:34.052 --> 27:36.350
So why don't you stay
the hell away from us?

27:36.421 --> 27:37.752
All of us.

27:46.297 --> 27:47.559
Hey, Mom?

27:48.767 --> 27:51.292
It wasn't Brooke. She's not pregnant.

27:54.606 --> 27:57.370
Are you happy about your pregnancy?

28:02.013 --> 28:03.708
Why would you ask me that?

28:03.782 --> 28:07.183
Well, when Andy proposed to you,

28:07.252 --> 28:10.050
you said no because
he wanted to have a family

28:10.121 --> 28:12.089
and you didn't want kids.

28:12.490 --> 28:16.756
And that's fair, Mom. You put
your life on hold for me a lot, but...

28:16.828 --> 28:18.819
Things are different now.

28:19.564 --> 28:21.657
This is Keith's child, too.

28:23.168 --> 28:28.470
Okay. Well, so then
what would you say if I told you

28:28.540 --> 28:31.600
that I wanted to stay
in Tree Hill for college?

28:33.678 --> 28:35.703
He did a good job with you,

28:36.715 --> 28:38.945
but UNC is not that far away.

28:39.484 --> 28:41.111
And I'll be fine.

28:47.125 --> 28:49.355
It's pretty cool, though, huh?

28:50.695 --> 28:53.289
That you and Keith are having a baby.

28:54.332 --> 28:57.699
It's kind of like a part of him
is coming back to us.

28:58.636 --> 29:00.797
He did a good job with you.

29:09.247 --> 29:10.908
Okay, so mission accomplished.

29:10.982 --> 29:13.246
I brought you some makeup
and those scissors you wanted,

29:13.318 --> 29:14.842
some music, a couple of outfits.

29:14.919 --> 29:17.888
Which reminds me, Clothes Over Bro's
should totally be designing hospital gowns

29:17.956 --> 29:20.754
'cause I would not be caught dead in that.

29:22.093 --> 29:23.253
Sorry.

29:25.363 --> 29:27.991
Do you think people can change, Brooke?

29:29.100 --> 29:32.365
I mean, truly change?

29:36.708 --> 29:40.303
Well, I'd like to say yes, but honestly,

29:42.046 --> 29:44.674
I don't really think people can change.

29:45.550 --> 29:47.541
You know, at the end of the day,
you are who you are,

29:47.619 --> 29:50.349
and it's probably who you've always been.

29:53.491 --> 29:56.551
What if who you've been
is pretty horrible?

29:59.731 --> 30:02.165
I brought you back your house keys.

30:02.534 --> 30:04.399
It's a very nice house,
big rooms, no parents.

30:04.469 --> 30:06.562
I used to have one of those.

30:08.773 --> 30:10.104
Keep them.

30:12.844 --> 30:15.938
I mean, you moved out
of Peyton's place, right?

30:16.014 --> 30:18.505
You might as well crash at my house.

30:18.583 --> 30:20.551
Unless you don't want to.

30:23.254 --> 30:26.951
So this is what it looks like
when hell freezes over.

30:31.262 --> 30:32.593
Thank you.

30:38.203 --> 30:40.398
<i>- She's A Runner.</i>
- Billy Squier.

30:40.471 --> 30:43.929
And I am very impressed
that you have Billy Squier on your iTunes.

30:44.008 --> 30:46.602
Actually, I think you gave that to me.

30:46.678 --> 30:50.205
- Okay, <i>The Runaway Found.</i>

30:57.455 --> 31:00.288
<i>... Devil.</i> You're good.

31:00.525 --> 31:03.153
Man, when was the last time
we just hung out?

31:04.395 --> 31:07.057
God, just the two of us? I don't know.

31:07.131 --> 31:10.294
Probably the day we hid out in the library,
and I got shot in the leg.

31:10.368 --> 31:11.460
Yeah.

31:11.970 --> 31:14.097
Do you think about that much?

31:14.472 --> 31:15.803
Every day.

31:16.641 --> 31:20.202
I wish I could take that day back
for your mom and Keith.

31:21.346 --> 31:24.907
And I wish I could take back our kiss
for you and Brooke.

31:29.587 --> 31:32.647
<i>Moody Suburban Teenage Love Song.</i>

31:33.558 --> 31:35.856
Nice try. Slow Runner.

31:38.463 --> 31:41.455
Okay, so this maybe brother of yours...

31:42.200 --> 31:43.997
He's not Ellie's kid, right?

31:44.435 --> 31:49.395
No, he is the son
of the biological father I haven't met.

31:50.275 --> 31:53.642
- Apparently his name is Derek.
- Are you gonna call him?

31:54.012 --> 31:55.479
I don't know.

31:56.180 --> 32:00.378
I mean, it's not just about me.
You know, it's his life to consider, too.

32:00.685 --> 32:03.984
So, I mean,
maybe he doesn't even know about me

32:04.722 --> 32:06.417
and maybe he doesn't want to know
about me.

32:06.491 --> 32:09.927
Or maybe he found a letter
in a Led Zeppelin album,

32:09.994 --> 32:13.521
and he's just a little too scared
to pick up the phone and dial.

32:17.402 --> 32:18.460
Hey.

32:18.870 --> 32:22.829
- We were just...
- I'd like to talk to my boyfriend, alone.

32:26.711 --> 32:28.838
Nice job not hitting on him.

32:29.948 --> 32:33.406
Luke, I'll get those CDs later.
Thanks for the sex.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.547
She's joking.

32:40.124 --> 32:41.216
I was trying to call you.

32:41.292 --> 32:43.385
You mean, when you weren't
hanging out with Peyton?

32:43.461 --> 32:45.588
Come on, Brooke, you never call me back.

32:45.663 --> 32:47.631
Now you know how I feel.

32:50.335 --> 32:53.498
Listen, I know
it's been difficult for you lately,

32:53.571 --> 32:57.029
losing Keith and your heart condition
and giving up basketball.

33:00.678 --> 33:04.273
I feel like
I've been keeping you close to me

33:04.349 --> 33:06.749
to try to protect you from those things,

33:08.119 --> 33:12.249
like I'm hanging onto the two of us
for you, but not for me.

33:14.459 --> 33:16.484
I'm sorry I kissed Peyton.

33:18.029 --> 33:19.758
I should have told you.

33:19.831 --> 33:21.799
It's not about that, Luke.

33:23.001 --> 33:23.990
It's not.

33:25.103 --> 33:29.164
I mean, I thought that it was,
but this is not about her.

33:30.208 --> 33:31.835
This is about me.

33:33.344 --> 33:35.005
I love you, Lucas.

33:37.482 --> 33:39.541
And I probably always will.

33:40.651 --> 33:44.485
But we go days without having
a meaningful conversation,

33:45.990 --> 33:49.892
and I used to miss you so much
when that happened.

33:52.430 --> 33:55.126
But it never seemed like you missed me.

33:58.302 --> 34:01.100
And I guess because of it,
I stopped missing you.

34:02.740 --> 34:04.708
I mean, look at today...

34:05.309 --> 34:08.277
<i>I guess</i>
<i>I should have said something, anything.</i>

34:09.414 --> 34:11.177
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>for a guy who wants to be a writer,</i>

34:11.248 --> 34:14.706
<i>it suddenly seemed</i>
<i>like no words had ever been written.</i>

34:15.553 --> 34:19.080
<i>But when someone tells you</i>
<i>that they somehow stopped missing you,</i>

34:19.690 --> 34:21.885
<i>you're pretty much screwed</i>
<i>no matter what you say.</i>

34:21.958 --> 34:23.984
It shouldn't be like this, Luke.

34:24.962 --> 34:26.690
- Brooke...
- I'm sorry.

34:27.864 --> 34:29.833
I can't do this anymore.

34:31.601 --> 34:32.591
<i>See?</i>

34:33.371 --> 34:35.339
<i>But there had to be something, right?</i>

34:37.175 --> 34:40.007
<i>Something that no one had ever said</i>
<i>in the history of the world,</i>

34:40.078 --> 34:42.170
<i>something that could change this.</i>

34:43.047 --> 34:44.241
Brooke.

34:48.886 --> 34:50.217
I'm sorry.

34:52.623 --> 34:54.112
Yeah, me, too.

35:00.998 --> 35:02.522
<i>That wasn't it.</i>

35:10.174 --> 35:11.766
Going somewhere?

35:15.012 --> 35:17.537
I didn't think you wanted to see me.

35:18.216 --> 35:19.513
I didn't.

35:19.584 --> 35:21.916
I really screwed this up, Mouth.

35:22.386 --> 35:26.083
I mean, we were fighting,
and I grabbed the wheel.

35:30.194 --> 35:31.923
I have to get out of here.

35:32.363 --> 35:34.957
You can't run away from this, Rachel.

35:35.700 --> 35:37.668
- He could die, Mouth.
- Listen to me.

35:37.735 --> 35:39.327
You know how you said
you were gonna tell everyone

35:39.403 --> 35:42.839
that you opened the time capsule,
and I said not to, that you should bury it?

35:42.907 --> 35:44.306
I was wrong.

35:44.709 --> 35:46.609
And until you face
all the mistakes you've made,

35:46.677 --> 35:48.235
you'll never change.

35:48.312 --> 35:50.906
- People don't change, Mouth.
- But they can.

35:51.849 --> 35:54.682
They just don't because it's easier not to.

35:55.253 --> 35:58.279
We're always waiting
for our lives to begin, like,

35:58.356 --> 36:01.018
figuring we'll be someone else someday.

36:01.092 --> 36:05.495
But after this accident
and losing Jimmy and Keith,

36:06.731 --> 36:08.699
what are we waiting for?

36:09.267 --> 36:11.861
All we have is now, Rachel.

36:13.104 --> 36:14.867
Don't run from this.

36:20.878 --> 36:25.440
I am all for living life to the fullest,
but can this day just be over already?

36:28.386 --> 36:32.914
Hey, Ma, you loved Dan, right,
in high school?

36:33.991 --> 36:35.356
Oddly, yes.

36:37.495 --> 36:40.658
Okay, look, I know you probably
can't answer this for me,

36:41.832 --> 36:44.630
but what did you do
when he didn't love you back?

36:45.069 --> 36:47.037
How did you get over it?

36:48.172 --> 36:50.504
When I do, I'll get back to you.

37:02.753 --> 37:04.721
<i>"My name is Lucas Scott.</i>

37:05.590 --> 37:07.956
<i>"I'm a senior at Tree Hill High School.</i>

37:09.594 --> 37:12.995
<i>"I play basketball. At least, I used to.</i>

37:14.398 --> 37:19.165
<i>"I have a girlfriend. At least, I used to."</i>

37:20.538 --> 37:22.733
<i>"And I have a best friend."</i>

38:32.777 --> 38:34.108
Hey, Brooke.

38:34.178 --> 38:38.444
Hey, look, I know that it's really late,
and it's been a long day,

38:40.484 --> 38:42.509
but I need to talk to you.

38:42.887 --> 38:44.548
Yeah. Come on in.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.424
The first thing I'd like to do
is take another pregnancy test,

38:51.495 --> 38:53.759
just to find out
exactly how far along you are.

38:53.831 --> 38:55.992
Then we can talk more specifically
about what lies ahead.

38:56.067 --> 38:57.432
- Okay?
- Okay.

38:57.501 --> 39:00.402
- Is this your first child?
- No, my second.

39:45.116 --> 39:47.516
Well, you're definitely pregnant.

40:00.965 --> 40:03.798
<i>"Tree Hill is just a place</i>
<i>somewhere in the world.</i>

40:04.702 --> 40:08.604
<i>"Maybe it's a lot like your world,</i>
<i>maybe it's nothing like it.</i>

40:11.275 --> 40:14.335
<i>"But if you look closer,</i>
<i>you might see someone like you.</i>

40:17.248 --> 40:19.375
<i>"Someone trying to find their way.</i>

40:24.054 --> 40:26.249
<i>"Someone trying to find their place.</i>

40:31.028 --> 40:33.189
<i>"Someone trying to find their self.</i>

40:43.007 --> 40:47.501
<i>"Sometimes it's easy to feel like you're</i>
<i>the only one in the world who's struggling,</i>

40:47.978 --> 40:51.744
<i>"who's frustrated or unsatisfied</i>
<i>or barely getting by. "</i>

40:54.185 --> 40:55.174
<i>Hello?</i>

41:02.193 --> 41:04.058
<i>"But that feeling's a lie.</i>

41:05.062 --> 41:07.189
<i>"And if you just hold on,</i>

41:07.264 --> 41:09.858
<i>"just find the courage</i>
<i>to face it all for another day,</i>

41:09.934 --> 41:13.597
<i>"someone or something</i>
<i>will find you and make it all okay.</i>

41:17.408 --> 41:19.968
<i>"Because we all need</i>
<i>a little help sometimes.</i>

41:23.547 --> 41:26.812
<i>"Someone to help us</i>
<i>hear the music in the world,</i>

41:28.586 --> 41:31.646
<i>"to remind us</i>
<i>that it won't always be this way. "</i>

41:35.159 --> 41:37.593
<i>"That someone is out there.</i>

41:39.997 --> 41:42.329
<i>"And that someone will find you."</i>
