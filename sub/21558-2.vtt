-[woman] What's happening?
-[glass shatters]

00:39.789 --> 00:41.458
[dispatcher on radio]
All units, we got a 10-66.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.168
Requesting backup immediately.

00:45.002 --> 00:47.422
[people shouting indistinctly in distance]

00:53.595 --> 00:56.013
-[woman 2] I can't open my door!
-[boy 1] Take what you can.

00:56.098 --> 00:58.350
[store owner] Hey! What the hell
do you kids think you're doing?

00:58.433 --> 01:00.935
-[boy 1] Shit!
-You're not gonna steal from my store!

01:01.018 --> 01:02.937
-[sirens blaring]
-[gasps]

01:03.020 --> 01:05.857
-[boy 2] Just take the stuff!
-[girl] Hey, hey, we're really sorry.

01:05.940 --> 01:08.235
-[gun cocks]
-[store owner] Too late for that.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.027
-[boy 2] Okay! Okay!
-[boy 1] We'll put it back.

01:10.112 --> 01:12.197
[boy 2] Hurry, this way! Come on. Run!

01:12.280 --> 01:14.199
-[store owner] Don't you run from me...
-[Matt grunts]

01:21.748 --> 01:23.750
[store owner] There they go!
Get the other gun!

01:32.259 --> 01:33.385
[grunts]

01:37.389 --> 01:39.307
[girl] Guys, hurry!
They're coming!

01:39.391 --> 01:40.767
[boy 2] Hurry, this way!
Come on!

01:40.850 --> 01:42.101
[girl] Please, stop. We'll leave--

-[gunshot]
-[girl] Oh, shit!

01:46.189 --> 01:47.232

-[man] You want some, too?

01:58.118 --> 02:00.370
Don't do it. They're just kids. [panting]

[grunting]

02:09.587 --> 02:11.839

02:22.725 --> 02:24.144
[store owner] Who are you?

02:36.030 --> 02:38.032
[theme music playing]

03:46.601 --> 03:51.314
Hey, Jess. It's me calling you
for the third or fourth or 19th time.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.233
I hear your neighborhood
was hit pretty hard,

03:53.316 --> 03:54.859
so call me so I know you're okay.

03:54.942 --> 03:58.070
Hey! Excuse me! Excuse me.
I'm so sorry. I'm running late for work.

03:58.154 --> 04:00.072
-Can I sneak through?
-[chuckles] You can try.

04:00.156 --> 04:01.783
-Thank you.
-[scoffs]

04:05.662 --> 04:06.663
Holy shit.

04:07.497 --> 04:10.166
[caller] Trish, it's really scary
when something like this happens.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.501
What do I tell my kids?

04:11.584 --> 04:12.877
After everything we've been through,

04:12.960 --> 04:15.505
we can't help but think
it's the incident or terrorism.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.465
True, but there's nothing to worry about.

04:17.549 --> 04:21.886
The mayor's office confirmed this morning,
it was a 4.6 magnitude earthquake.

04:21.969 --> 04:25.390
A shallow one, actually,
centered in Hell's Kitchen.

04:25.473 --> 04:29.185
I'm told seismologists are looking
at a fault line on the Hudson

04:29.269 --> 04:31.688
to see if it could be
the source of the problem.

04:32.439 --> 04:36.609
Jane from Brooklyn, you're on Trish Talk.
What did you feel last night?

04:36.693 --> 04:38.736
[Jane] Not an earthquake, that's for sure.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.323
Right. Brooklyn's outside
the affected area.

04:41.406 --> 04:44.326
No. I mean, whatever it was,
you're reporting it wrong.

04:44.409 --> 04:47.537
Look, I know it's easy
to give into fear, but--

04:47.620 --> 04:50.247
[scoffs] I'm no conspiracy theorist.
I'm a geologist.

04:50.332 --> 04:52.875
Shallow earthquakes can be up
to 50-miles deep.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.545
But whatever happened last night
was only 300-feet deep--

04:55.628 --> 04:56.963
-[line disconnects]
-Wait, what?

04:58.673 --> 04:59.716
Hello?

05:02.635 --> 05:05.847
Okay, so it looks like phone lines
may have been affected, too.

05:05.930 --> 05:09.559
But let's keep the conversation going.
I want your thoughts next.

05:10.727 --> 05:14.230
[announcer] Trish Talk, stay tuned.
Thanks for listening.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.484
What the hell happened?

05:17.567 --> 05:19.486
The interview
with the school superintendent,

05:19.569 --> 05:20.737
boss says it's going on now.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.365
-Did you cut off my call?
-They called from upstairs.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.074
Said we gotta lay off
the earthquake stuff.

05:25.157 --> 05:27.118
I don't know why,
but from the tone they used,

05:27.201 --> 05:28.703
it was not a conversation.

05:37.545 --> 05:40.798
[Strieber] Detective Knight.
Took long enough to get here.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.800
Got here fast as I could, Captain.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.679
Well, the room was paid for in cash.
No records downstairs.

05:47.514 --> 05:50.349
Place like this, company motto is
"No questions asked."

05:50.433 --> 05:54.061
The FBI showed up just after we did.
And Homeland Security's on the way.

05:54.145 --> 05:57.607
So whatever this is, we got orders
to keep it away from the press.

05:57.690 --> 06:02.069
-What is this? We got a body?
-Worse. Looks like you were right.

06:03.362 --> 06:05.823
Son of a bitch.

06:08.576 --> 06:11.621
I told you these assholes
were transporting explosives.

06:13.665 --> 06:14.832
We sure it's them?

06:14.916 --> 06:17.001
Uh, at the very least,
I think it's connected.

06:17.669 --> 06:21.088
Maybe the fireworks are theirs,
and maybe somebody stole them from 'em.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.883
I just sign the overtime.
This shit's for you to figure out.

06:23.966 --> 06:27.094
-Well, who called this in?
-Oh, now that's where it gets funny.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.221
Jessica Jones.

06:31.724 --> 06:34.561
[Misty] I heard about her.
Thought she'd be bigger.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.438
[Strieber] Says she
was following a client.

06:36.521 --> 06:40.066
-I bet this scared the shit out of her.
-Rumor is, she ain't scared of much.

06:40.149 --> 06:42.068
Well, she ain't met you.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.486
[chuckles]

06:46.072 --> 06:48.324
[Jessica sighs] You gotta be kidding me.

06:48.407 --> 06:49.784
[FBI agent] So the guy
who rented this room--

06:49.867 --> 06:53.788
I already told you, I didn't see him.
He was gone before I got here.

06:53.871 --> 06:56.708
Now I have been here four hours.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.250
Can I go now, dipshit?

06:58.334 --> 07:00.377
You're done when we're done.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.797
-[sighs]
-You got a mouth.

07:04.674 --> 07:05.675
You noticed.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.135
Ms. Jones, you can go for now.

07:08.219 --> 07:10.054
Stupid son of a bitch.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.057
Can you believe this chick?

07:20.523 --> 07:21.899
Did she just take...

07:22.692 --> 07:24.652
Hey! Hey!

07:28.698 --> 07:29.699
Hey!

07:46.549 --> 07:48.092
[Colleen] Looks like we're good.

07:48.175 --> 07:49.761
I don't see any damage.

07:50.678 --> 07:54.557
And thank God. No one told me
I'd need earthquake insurance in New York.

07:56.893 --> 07:57.894
Danny?

08:01.147 --> 08:02.148
Danny...

08:08.070 --> 08:09.572
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.867
Everything okay out there?
[grunts softly]

08:12.950 --> 08:16.245
They're saying the epicenter
was in Hell's Kitchen. [sighs]

08:16.328 --> 08:17.497
[Danny] Hmm.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.625
I'm glad you're meditating.
You need a break.

08:20.708 --> 08:24.003
[scoffs] It's not a break.
I'm refocusing.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.508
If I ever come across that warrior again,
I'll be prepared.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.718
Yeah. Okay, look.

08:30.802 --> 08:33.805
I've been thinking about the man
who died in the sewer.

08:34.430 --> 08:37.266
He called you Iron Fist.
He knew something.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.769
He wasn't just a victim. I...

08:40.770 --> 08:43.230
-I think he's our next lead.
-[sighs]

08:44.566 --> 08:46.233
Well, he died fighting the Hand, right?

08:46.317 --> 08:48.778
-That must be a sign.
-Of what?

08:49.529 --> 08:51.280
That we have allies.

08:52.281 --> 08:53.490
We're not alone in this.

08:55.492 --> 08:56.493
No.

08:57.244 --> 09:00.540
This is my responsibility.
It's my fight.

09:00.623 --> 09:03.876
Yeah. You keep saying that,
but whoever he was, he was trained.

09:04.544 --> 09:05.920
And he was also willing to die.

09:06.003 --> 09:09.048
He might not have died
if I hadn't left my post in K'un-Lun.

09:09.131 --> 09:12.093
-I know that you are angry--
-This isn't about anger.

09:13.427 --> 09:14.846
It's about fault.

09:15.512 --> 09:18.558
All I'm saying is you're not
the only person the Hand has ever hurt.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.602
It was his fight, too.

09:22.269 --> 09:23.605
And mine.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.067
You're not alone in this.

09:30.486 --> 09:31.528
So what?

09:32.655 --> 09:35.032
We just go and find a team to join?

09:36.242 --> 09:37.326
An army?

09:38.995 --> 09:42.414
He sent us back to New York.
Maybe there are people here.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.628
It's a shot in the dark,
but I think it's one worth taking.

09:49.797 --> 09:50.798
Okay.

09:53.092 --> 09:54.677
So I guess you have a plan?

09:55.970 --> 09:57.639
As a matter of fact...

09:59.515 --> 10:02.351
His weapon,
the sword he fought with...

10:03.060 --> 10:06.147
It wasn't a standard katana.
It was a Tsukamoto.

10:06.230 --> 10:08.024
There are maybe ten of these in the world.

10:08.775 --> 10:12.153
There is a workshop here in New York.
One of the world's best.

10:12.236 --> 10:14.405
If the guy who died in Cambodia
ever had business here,

10:14.488 --> 10:16.240
maybe it was at that workshop.

10:17.074 --> 10:18.242
And what if he didn't?

10:20.286 --> 10:21.537
Then we keep looking.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.123
What if it's a trap?

10:25.332 --> 10:27.043
Then we fight our way out of it.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.880
-Danny, what?
-[sighs]

10:33.925 --> 10:35.342
You and I, we...

10:37.053 --> 10:39.305
We haven't had the greatest luck
trusting other people.

10:40.472 --> 10:41.515
Yeah...

10:43.225 --> 10:44.644
but do you trust me?

10:46.395 --> 10:47.604
Of course.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.029
[breathing heavily]

11:07.208 --> 11:09.418
[continues breathing heavily]

11:12.671 --> 11:13.923
[grunts]

11:16.175 --> 11:18.427
God damn it. God damn it.

11:51.002 --> 11:52.628
[lock clattering]

11:55.714 --> 11:57.174
[key clatters]

12:11.773 --> 12:13.775
[automated voice] Foggy. Foggy.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.778
-Foggy. Fog--
-[cell phone beeps]

12:18.487 --> 12:19.613
Hey, Foggy.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.995
Just keep it clean.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.789
[indistinct chatter]

12:28.790 --> 12:30.041
[grunts]

12:41.886 --> 12:42.887
[Luke sighs]

12:42.970 --> 12:45.681
Not a lot of people have insurance here.

12:45.764 --> 12:48.142
Yeah? At least nobody died.

12:48.225 --> 12:50.061
-Thanks to you.
-[scoffs]

12:50.144 --> 12:51.228
[Claire sighs]

12:51.312 --> 12:54.190
You know, most people
get out of jail and they, uh...

12:54.273 --> 12:55.691
pop a beer.

12:55.774 --> 12:57.359
[Luke sighs] Maybe I will go get a drink.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.528
I was thinking about going
by Elmore's tonight.

12:59.611 --> 13:02.031
-Elmore's?
-Yeah, the bar on Douglass.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.532
Oh, I know it.

13:03.615 --> 13:06.577
Has a reputation
for a certain kind of crowd.

13:06.660 --> 13:08.287
That's kinda what I was hoping.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.289
Are you hunting criminals?

13:10.372 --> 13:12.917
'Cause I thought you said you were
gonna take it easy on that for a while.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.670
[sighs] Look, someone's hiring young men
in Harlem to do their dirty work.

13:16.753 --> 13:19.381
Misty said the NYPD doesn't know
what these young men are doing,

13:19.465 --> 13:21.592
but the body count's growing, so...

13:22.384 --> 13:23.635
Okay.

13:23.719 --> 13:26.638
Is the NYPD gonna pay you
for doing their job?

13:28.182 --> 13:31.060
No. [stammers]
But this... [sighs]

13:31.143 --> 13:32.895
This one kid,
he's too afraid to ask for help.

13:34.813 --> 13:37.524
[sighs] I gotta step in
before anyone else gets hurt.

13:38.650 --> 13:41.820
-It's... it's what Pop would've wanted.
-I know.

13:42.404 --> 13:43.405
It's like you said,

13:43.489 --> 13:46.450
if we don't take responsibility
for our neighborhood, no one else will.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.621
If you're gonna rattle heads for answers,

13:50.704 --> 13:53.749
you should know
no one goes to Elmore's anymore.

13:54.583 --> 13:56.961
I've stitched up enough knife wounds
at the shelter to know

13:57.044 --> 13:59.546
if you're looking
for the current criminal hotspot,

14:00.589 --> 14:02.799
the place to go is on 188th Street.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.053
Rathole called
Trouble and a Pair of Dice.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.606
[playing classical music]

15:01.775 --> 15:03.110
[sighs]

15:08.324 --> 15:12.578
I'm told your donation to the Philharmonic
should just about cover the remodeling.

15:13.329 --> 15:16.498
A small price to pay
in the larger scheme of things.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.875
You know, with the kind of support
you've provided,

15:18.960 --> 15:21.295
we would love to host you
at our next gala.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.715
I've always preferred
a more intimate setting.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.259
Of course.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.762
The piece you've requested
is a curious one.

15:30.846 --> 15:33.890
Brahms didn't often write in C minor.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.892
Matter of fact,
that was Beethoven's key of choice.

15:35.977 --> 15:39.563
But here, Beethoven's influence
is quite pronounced.

15:39.646 --> 15:43.359
It's not influence.
It was a direct response.

15:43.442 --> 15:46.653
All Brahms wanted was to prove
that he could do it, too.

15:46.737 --> 15:49.448
[chuckles] He was petty like that.

15:49.531 --> 15:50.866
[chuckles]

15:51.658 --> 15:55.746
Your insight on music history,
it never ceases to amaze me.

15:55.829 --> 16:00.584
Oh, it's nothing.
It's just stuff I picked up along the way.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.175
If you'll excuse me.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.302
Of course.

16:10.386 --> 16:12.138
-There's been a complication.
-What kind?

16:12.221 --> 16:16.058
There's a wall blocking our access.
It is full of inscriptions.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.394
Familiar phrases about K'un-Lun.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.938
-Tear it down.
-We've tried. Nothing works.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.694
We've never encountered a wall before.

16:28.904 --> 16:31.865
They knew we'd get here... eventually.

16:32.824 --> 16:35.744
Perhaps we should rethink our plan.

16:35.827 --> 16:37.997
That's always been
the difference between us.

16:38.830 --> 16:42.543
You are quick to rethink.
I'm a bit more stubborn.

16:43.544 --> 16:46.088
If they wanted to take
this one from us forever,

16:46.172 --> 16:49.341
they would've destroyed it,
not protected it.

16:51.093 --> 16:54.055
-Which means it's not a wall.
-I've seen it.

16:54.846 --> 16:55.931
It's a door.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.309
It's meant to be opened.

16:58.392 --> 16:59.851
By what?

17:01.103 --> 17:02.604
[sighs]

17:02.688 --> 17:07.193
The conviction of the elders of K'un-Lun
was always unwavering.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.944
They think it's a virtue.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.864
But in the end, all it ever did
was make them predictable.

17:12.948 --> 17:14.866
They've locked it away.

17:14.950 --> 17:17.911
But a lock is not a lock without a key.

17:18.620 --> 17:23.542
And from the beginning,
they have valued one thing above all else.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.107
[muttering indistinctly]

17:49.901 --> 17:50.944
Okay.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.351
What?

18:52.173 --> 18:53.174
[sighs]

18:56.468 --> 18:57.803
You've gotta be kidding me.

19:05.769 --> 19:08.189
[sighs] You've got to be kidding me.

19:13.235 --> 19:16.071
-Hi. I'm confused.
-[sighs] Okay?

19:16.155 --> 19:17.656
I'm looking into this company,

19:17.739 --> 19:20.909
but they've been transferring assets
from one corporation to the next.

19:20.992 --> 19:23.704
Like, they're changing their name,
shell company stuff.

19:23.787 --> 19:26.873
Yet, I have no idea
what it is they actually do.

19:26.957 --> 19:28.500
Oh, so what do you need from me?

19:28.584 --> 19:31.044
[sighs] The oldest record dates back
to 1820,

19:31.128 --> 19:34.047
but as crazy as this sounds,
I need to go back further than that.

19:34.130 --> 19:37.551
Oh, well, you... you wanna go
to the historical branch uptown.

19:37.634 --> 19:39.636
And you'll need an appointment.

19:40.304 --> 19:41.805
Okay, thanks.

19:41.888 --> 19:43.724
[Hogarth] Actually, you don't.

19:44.766 --> 19:46.393
Jessica, we need to talk.

19:47.644 --> 19:48.812
Hogarth.

19:48.895 --> 19:50.981
[rock music playing]

19:52.358 --> 19:53.942
[Foggy] Been a long time, Josie.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.903
I can't tell you
how much I miss this place.

19:55.986 --> 19:59.406
Oh, so Mr. Uptown misses
our humble establishment.

19:59.490 --> 20:00.699
[chuckles]

20:03.244 --> 20:05.537
-[Matt sighs]
-How's work?

20:05.621 --> 20:07.331
I heard about that settlement.

20:07.414 --> 20:09.291
-Eleven million.
-Yeah.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.960
-You sure you want to stay pro bono?
-[chuckles]

20:12.043 --> 20:13.629
I'm just happy I could help.

20:14.755 --> 20:15.964
-Thanks, Josie.
-Hmm.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.386
How about you? How's things?

20:21.470 --> 20:23.555
Good. Big office.

20:24.515 --> 20:26.517
Far from what we dreamed
about doing when we were kids,

20:26.600 --> 20:29.395
but at least I get to see Marci a lot.

20:30.103 --> 20:31.897
-After hours.
-That's great, Foggy.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.232
Naked, I mean.

20:33.315 --> 20:34.483
[chuckles]

20:37.319 --> 20:38.362
[sighs]

20:40.281 --> 20:44.243
Hey, thanks for reaching out.
It's, uh... been a while, huh?

20:45.244 --> 20:46.245
That it has.

20:47.496 --> 20:50.957
I talked to Karen.
She said you guys grabbed coffee.

20:51.041 --> 20:53.168
I don't mean to pry,
but where you guys at?

20:53.252 --> 20:54.420
Relationship status?

20:55.754 --> 20:59.132
-We are "figuring ourselves out."
-Good.

21:00.384 --> 21:02.344
After you told her your little secret,

21:02.428 --> 21:04.555
lucky she didn't freak out
and have us both disbarred.

21:04.638 --> 21:07.182
-We can trust her.
-I know.

21:09.768 --> 21:11.186
You can trust me, too.

21:15.023 --> 21:16.483
How you doing after last night?

21:17.776 --> 21:20.529
Uh, yeah, good.
It was, uh, crazy.

21:20.612 --> 21:22.281
That's not what I'm talking about.

21:24.115 --> 21:26.910
You don't have to say it.
Your knuckles speak volumes.

21:28.579 --> 21:29.663
[clicks tongue]

21:36.795 --> 21:39.548
That why you called?
To see if I'd done anything stupid?

21:39.631 --> 21:41.842
Nobody's saying it's stupid.
I know you're trying.

21:43.385 --> 21:45.846
Earth shook, Foggy.
The cops weren't coming.

21:45.929 --> 21:47.138
Matt, stop!

21:48.139 --> 21:50.601
Whatever you're going through,
I'm not gonna judge.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.228
But I do think I can help you through it.

21:55.021 --> 21:56.440
I came to offer you something.

21:57.483 --> 22:01.027
These are case files.
Stuff I'm too busy to handle right now.

22:02.321 --> 22:05.866
Ranging from petty bullshit
to life-changingly important.

22:05.949 --> 22:09.953
-Come on, I don't need your charity.
-This isn't that. It's outsourcing.

22:10.036 --> 22:13.081
Most importantly, it's the type of stuff
you're doing anyway.

22:13.164 --> 22:17.336
Malpractice. Workmen's comp.
Good people who need justice.

22:19.129 --> 22:22.424
If you take these,
it'll keep you up-to-your-eyeballs busy.

22:23.091 --> 22:26.553
And the next time you're on the fence
about stepping out at night...

22:27.763 --> 22:30.181
you'll be too busy
being another kind of hero.

22:35.061 --> 22:38.399
It's not a solution.
Not long-term.

22:39.274 --> 22:40.776
But right now...

22:42.694 --> 22:44.237
it's the best I got.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.116
What if it doesn't work?

22:49.701 --> 22:51.953
[chuckles softly] Then we tried anyway.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.791
All right. Thanks, man.

23:03.757 --> 23:07.177
-[Jessica] What are you doing here?
-[Hogarth] Talking to you.

23:07.260 --> 23:11.181
In a city of nine million people,
we just happen to bump into each other?

23:11.264 --> 23:13.183
Are you having me followed?

23:13.266 --> 23:15.143
[sighs] I can't believe this.

23:15.226 --> 23:17.979
-You haven't returned my calls.
-I haven't returned anybody's calls.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.230
I couldn't help but take it personally.

23:19.314 --> 23:20.899
-Maybe you should.
-[chuckles]

23:20.982 --> 23:22.943
I'm here to ask you to be careful.

23:23.944 --> 23:26.947
-Be careful why?
-FBI, Homeland Security.

23:27.030 --> 23:29.199
Whatever it is you stumbled
onto last night, it's big.

23:29.282 --> 23:33.161
I didn't stumble onto anything.
I took a case on purpose.

23:33.244 --> 23:35.997
-Oh, I... I heard you'd put that off.
-You heard wrong.

23:36.081 --> 23:39.000
Listen, I... I know you well enough,
so I'm going to say this very simply.

23:40.168 --> 23:41.962
-Walk away.
-[scoffs]

23:42.045 --> 23:44.798
Whatever this is, let the feds handle it.

23:46.341 --> 23:48.426
After your rather explosive discovery
last night,

23:48.510 --> 23:51.513
your client's husband has been placed
on a federal watch list.

23:52.347 --> 23:54.600
It's now a matter of national security.

23:55.266 --> 23:58.103
Which means hundreds
of law enforcement officers.

23:58.186 --> 24:01.397
All hands on deck.
Every ego on display.

24:01.482 --> 24:05.736
All it takes is one overzealous agent
who wants to save the world,

24:05.819 --> 24:07.028
and this man, John Raymond,

24:07.112 --> 24:10.240
and anyone suspected of aiding him
will be shot on sight.

24:10.323 --> 24:13.910
There is nothing in this guy's profile
that suggests he's a terrorist.

24:14.578 --> 24:18.874
They just found enough C-4
in that motel room to level a city block.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.000
What do you think it looks like?

24:21.543 --> 24:25.046
The government is not going to rest
until they've got him.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.465
I just... I don't wanna see you
caught in the cross fire.

24:29.384 --> 24:32.387
Is this about protecting me
or protecting you?

24:33.972 --> 24:38.226
[smacks lips] Take the day off.
Have a drink or five. You've earned it.

24:39.185 --> 24:41.938
They wouldn't have found those explosives
if it weren't for you.

24:42.022 --> 24:43.314
You actually saved lives today.

24:44.650 --> 24:48.529
Well, save yourself some time, Hogarth.
Stop worrying about me.

24:52.282 --> 24:53.449
[Hogarth sighs]

24:56.119 --> 24:58.454
-[laughter]
-[indistinct chatter]

25:18.684 --> 25:23.354
[Turk] This only looks like plastic,
but I'm telling you it's solid gold.

25:23.438 --> 25:25.231
Earthquake has everyone going crazy.

25:25.315 --> 25:27.568
Nobody's paying attention
to the little things,

25:27.651 --> 25:31.822
like what is or isn't in their wallets.

25:35.283 --> 25:38.745
-[sighs] Welcome back, big man.
-We need to talk.

25:39.495 --> 25:41.122
[gasps and pants]

25:43.083 --> 25:45.961
-This is how you talk?
-I want answers, Turk.

25:46.044 --> 25:47.337
How I get 'em is up to you.

25:47.420 --> 25:51.216
Cage, what part of this shit
looks like it's up to me?

25:51.299 --> 25:54.761
Mariah and Shades...
I need to know what they're up to.

25:54.845 --> 25:59.057
Far as I know, nothing.
They ghosted right after you left.

25:59.140 --> 26:02.143
If they got their hands in anything,
it ain't stuff I've seen.

26:02.227 --> 26:05.105
Then who's recruiting kids out of Harlem
and getting them killed?

26:05.188 --> 26:07.983
Kids? Man, do I look like the PTA?

26:09.442 --> 26:13.905
Late-night work. Pays well, ends bad.
No one seems to know what they're doing.

26:13.989 --> 26:16.783
Look, I'd love to help,
but I don't know shit.

26:17.492 --> 26:18.744
I think you do.

26:21.788 --> 26:24.916
[sputters] Okay! I heard about it!

26:25.000 --> 26:28.378
But ain't nobody come asking me, okay?
I'm too old-school for this anyway.

26:28.461 --> 26:30.631
What are they doing?
And who are they doing it for?

26:30.714 --> 26:33.258
Some new guy. Can't miss him.

26:34.134 --> 26:35.010
I don't know his name.

26:35.093 --> 26:38.555
Everyone just calls him White Hat
on account of his unique fashion sense.

26:38.639 --> 26:44.936
Real deal African brother, too, man.
White suit, Panama hat, alligator shoes.

26:46.354 --> 26:50.275
-Where can I find him?
-I've only seen him a couple times.

26:50.358 --> 26:52.694
Try around 151st and Amsterdam.

26:54.404 --> 26:56.907
If this isn't the truth, I'll be back.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.784
And you won't like me then.

27:01.119 --> 27:02.746
I don't like you now.

27:21.807 --> 27:23.308
[bell ringing]

27:26.895 --> 27:27.896
Hello?

27:31.900 --> 27:33.234
[chuckles]

27:35.070 --> 27:36.529
Is it weird that I wanna live here?

27:45.831 --> 27:46.832
Danny.

27:47.623 --> 27:49.542
Danny, this is a Tsukamoto.

27:53.629 --> 27:54.630
Huh.

27:55.506 --> 27:57.050
Just like the one you showed me.

27:58.134 --> 27:59.135
Yeah.

28:00.971 --> 28:02.597
But you don't sharpen these.

28:08.686 --> 28:10.480
Unless you plan on using them.

28:12.190 --> 28:13.191
Danny...

28:48.226 --> 28:50.353
[woman shouting in distance]

28:52.438 --> 28:54.357
[clamoring in distance]

28:59.154 --> 29:00.280
[Colleen] Oh, my God.

29:02.157 --> 29:03.449
[Danny] It hasn't been long.

29:03.533 --> 29:05.160
[clamoring continues]

29:05.243 --> 29:06.369
He's still warm.

29:07.578 --> 29:08.997
[Colleen breathes heavily]

29:09.956 --> 29:10.957
Hey.

29:12.583 --> 29:14.252
Someone was dragged out of here.

29:17.338 --> 29:18.924
This must have been the Hand.

29:19.007 --> 29:21.051
[man groaning in distance]

29:23.929 --> 29:26.597
-[clamoring continues]
-Then who are these people?

29:29.851 --> 29:30.936
I don't know.

29:56.544 --> 29:58.629
-Danny?
-[breathing heavily]

30:04.803 --> 30:06.012
[Colleen] What is it?

30:07.763 --> 30:08.890
[Danny] It's K'un-Lun.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.021
[line ringing]

30:57.188 --> 30:58.398
-Misty, it's Luke.
-Hey.

30:58.481 --> 31:00.150
I think I found something.

31:00.233 --> 31:02.110
You should get a warrant
and get down here.

31:02.193 --> 31:06.406
-Am I making arrests?
-Think so. It's about those kids.

31:07.615 --> 31:09.034
I may have found a lead.

31:12.620 --> 31:15.623
Luke? Where are you?
I need an address.

31:16.832 --> 31:18.960
-Never mind.
-What?

31:19.044 --> 31:21.922
-I gotta take care of someone first.
-No. Luke--

31:36.895 --> 31:40.731
Push my calls ten minutes.
Franklin, I need a word.

31:40.815 --> 31:42.608
See you later. [sighs]

31:42.692 --> 31:45.486
How's your case load?
I need you to keep an eye on something.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.323
-Happy to.
-But it's gotta be off the record.

31:48.406 --> 31:49.407
Okay.

31:49.490 --> 31:52.577
Someone who used to work here,
[stammers] a freelancer...

31:52.660 --> 31:54.955
She has a tendency to go rogue.
Her name is Jessica Jones.

31:55.038 --> 31:57.916
Now you and I never had this conversation,

31:57.999 --> 32:01.502
but the second
she gets herself into trouble,

32:01.586 --> 32:05.090
priority one is keeping that trouble
very far away from us.

32:05.173 --> 32:06.174
Okay.

32:07.342 --> 32:10.720
So... Sorry, uh, just to be clear...

32:11.762 --> 32:13.889
this is all just in case?
She's not in trouble now?

32:13.974 --> 32:17.060
I wish. With Jessica,
it's just a matter of time.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.152
[cell phone ringing]

32:28.363 --> 32:29.364
[Jessica] Hey.

32:29.447 --> 32:30.781
[Trish] Jess, where have you been?

32:30.865 --> 32:32.700
-Sorry, I had a long day.
-Me, too.

32:32.783 --> 32:35.036
Something weird's going on at the studio.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.496
Weird how?

32:36.579 --> 32:38.081
This tremor stuff, I think...

32:38.164 --> 32:40.250
I think they want me
to sweep it under the rug.

32:42.127 --> 32:43.628
Trish, I gotta call you back.

33:00.561 --> 33:04.315
[sighs] Malcolm, what did I tell you
about coming in my apartment?

33:04.983 --> 33:06.609
I told you to stop following me.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.746
[Danny] It doesn't make sense.

33:19.872 --> 33:21.082
[stammers]

33:21.166 --> 33:23.418
Why do these people
have a picture of K'un-Lun?

33:25.211 --> 33:26.962
And what else did they know?

33:28.673 --> 33:31.467
-[van door slams]
-Someone's coming.

33:38.766 --> 33:40.435
[man] You guys start over there.

34:03.416 --> 34:04.667
[whispers] What are they doing?

34:05.960 --> 34:07.712
[Colleen whispers] I don't know.

34:07.795 --> 34:10.215
But they're not gonna get away with this.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.431
[Jessica] Your wife came to me.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.559
She was worried.

34:21.642 --> 34:25.020
-I told you to stay away.
-Mr. Raymond, trust me.

34:25.730 --> 34:27.107
Right now, I wish I'd listened.

34:27.690 --> 34:28.941
Are you working with them?

34:30.068 --> 34:31.069
With who?

34:32.112 --> 34:33.404
You know who I'm talking about.

34:34.864 --> 34:35.990
I work alone.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.867
[breathing heavily] Always has.

34:37.950 --> 34:40.745
[stammers] Look, like I said,
I'm barely on the payroll.

34:40.828 --> 34:42.997
Okay, whatever you think is going on...

34:44.624 --> 34:47.001
whatever you think is happening here--

34:47.085 --> 34:50.213
I know damn well what is happening here.
I know too much.

34:50.296 --> 34:52.965
[breathing heavily]
And next, they'll come after my family.

34:53.048 --> 34:56.469
Who's they?
Who do you think is after you?

34:56.552 --> 34:58.179
I can't tell you. I...

34:59.347 --> 35:01.891
This... this is not me.
I'm a good man.

35:02.642 --> 35:03.768
Make sure you tell her that.

35:03.851 --> 35:06.437
Okay, with any luck,
you're gonna tell her that yourself.

35:06.521 --> 35:09.524
Now your family is worried.
They just wanted to know what happened.

35:09.607 --> 35:10.816
And the cops...

35:11.609 --> 35:14.820
They just wanna know
why you started stockpiling explosives.

35:14.904 --> 35:15.905
What?

35:16.614 --> 35:18.408
There's nowhere to go.

35:18.491 --> 35:20.451
They'll find me.
They'll... they'll hurt me.

35:20.535 --> 35:23.413
To be honest, if you hurt my friend,
I'm gonna hurt you worse.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.957
I was just trying to stop them.

35:27.041 --> 35:29.835
-They're gonna take down the city.
-Who?

35:31.671 --> 35:33.964
I can't help you if you won't tell me who.

35:34.048 --> 35:36.967
[sighs] I should never have come here.

35:39.887 --> 35:42.265
Oh, my God. It's too late.

35:52.942 --> 35:55.778
[choking] You can't have this.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.573
[Jessica gasps]

35:59.949 --> 36:01.451
[both grunting]

36:06.289 --> 36:07.915
[panting] You okay?

36:49.332 --> 36:50.833
[Misty] Hold it right there.

36:52.793 --> 36:55.338
-[sighs] Shit.
-Turn around.

36:57.715 --> 36:59.217
Get your hands up!

36:59.300 --> 37:00.801
-[sighs]
-Now!

37:15.149 --> 37:17.151
Hey there, assholes.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.736
[all grunting]

37:22.573 --> 37:25.326
-[Danny grunting]
-[man groaning]

37:32.875 --> 37:33.918
[muffled scream]

37:34.752 --> 37:37.338
-[grunting] You with the Hand?
-[muffled] No!

37:40.633 --> 37:43.261
-What are you doing in there?
-I don't know! I'm just a cleanup!

37:43.344 --> 37:45.471
-Cleanup for them?
-I don't know who they are!

37:45.555 --> 37:47.014
Don't lie to me!

37:47.097 --> 37:48.308
[muffled grunting]

37:52.061 --> 37:54.314
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

37:55.606 --> 37:57.608
[groaning]

37:57.692 --> 37:59.610
-You all right?
-[panting] What are you doing?

37:59.694 --> 38:01.111
In between gigs, huh?

38:03.364 --> 38:04.198
Hey!

38:07.076 --> 38:08.953
-You back for more?
-[panting] Oh...

38:09.745 --> 38:11.414
we've not even started.

38:14.625 --> 38:16.168
[grunting]

38:34.269 --> 38:35.355
What are you made of?

38:36.105 --> 38:38.232
Just remember, you started this.

38:41.986 --> 38:44.113
[grunting]

38:49.118 --> 38:50.285
[groans]

38:50.953 --> 38:52.287
Stay down.

38:54.957 --> 38:55.958
[grunts]

38:57.502 --> 39:00.004
-[Cole grunts]
-[Luke yells]

39:03.215 --> 39:04.967
[both grunting]

39:26.113 --> 39:27.657
[grunts]

39:31.411 --> 39:32.453
[groans]

39:33.871 --> 39:36.206
[panting, grunts]

39:36.999 --> 39:38.459
[sirens blaring]

39:43.255 --> 39:44.632
[cop] Freeze!

39:45.550 --> 39:48.343
Danny! We have to go!

39:59.063 --> 40:01.023
[cop] Get on your knees, now!

40:01.106 --> 40:02.983
On your knees! Hands in the air!

40:15.580 --> 40:18.541
[Alexandra] Everyone else
on your side is dead.

40:18.624 --> 40:20.543
You know who I am,
I know who you are,

40:20.626 --> 40:22.753
so let's skip the wartime banter.

40:23.337 --> 40:26.048
Time is not something
I can afford to waste.

40:27.758 --> 40:31.386
Not for your benefit but for mine,
I'm taking the blinds off.

40:32.221 --> 40:34.682
Try not to bite, old friend.

40:34.765 --> 40:36.266
It's undignified.

40:41.772 --> 40:43.023
Alexandra.

40:43.107 --> 40:45.151
[chuckles] Stick.

40:46.485 --> 40:48.612
We have so much to talk about.

40:51.699 --> 40:52.950
[Jessica sighs]

40:56.036 --> 40:59.499
-Are these necessary?
-Standard protocol. Nothing personal.

41:00.750 --> 41:05.505
John Raymond, the body we found
in your office slash apartment.

41:05.588 --> 41:09.049
Malcolm Ducasse, your friend
being interrogated down the hall.

41:09.133 --> 41:10.217
And Jessica...

41:10.843 --> 41:13.178
-Look, I don't know what--
-...Jones.

41:14.013 --> 41:15.055
Really?

41:15.139 --> 41:19.268
You have been a huge pain in my ass
all day, you know that?

41:19.351 --> 41:21.311
-Am I being charged with something?
-Not yet.

41:21.395 --> 41:24.314
But you might have interrupted
a city-wide investigation.

41:24.398 --> 41:27.317
-You stole evidence from my crime scene.
-I don't know what you're talking about.

41:27.401 --> 41:29.069
And you got my one lead killed.

41:30.988 --> 41:33.616
-I was trying to help him.
-But you didn't.

41:35.826 --> 41:38.162
-His family was worried.
-Yeah?

41:38.245 --> 41:41.499
Well, now all they have to worry about
are funeral arrangements.

41:43.208 --> 41:47.087
Your office is currently a crime scene,
but I need your cooperation.

41:47.171 --> 41:50.716
-[sighs] Am I a suspect?
-Criminal mischief...

41:50.800 --> 41:53.553
tampering with evidence,
petty larceny--

41:53.636 --> 41:57.682
-Am I a murder suspect?
-No. But I think you know who killed him.

41:57.765 --> 42:01.310
-Yeah. He shot himself.
-Then who were you chasing?

42:02.019 --> 42:03.228
[sighs]

42:03.312 --> 42:04.855
Officer, unless you have
a reason to hold me--

42:04.939 --> 42:08.025
Don't give me that "officer" bullshit.
What did you see?

42:15.449 --> 42:19.244
[sighs] Look, I know that you think
you're just doing your job,

42:19.328 --> 42:23.290
but I'm telling you,
this case isn't normal.

42:23.373 --> 42:26.043
You are walking into some weird-ass shit.

42:26.126 --> 42:28.087
Jessica Jones, stop talking.

42:28.170 --> 42:29.880
Hi, this is over.

42:30.881 --> 42:32.049
Who the hell are you?

42:32.132 --> 42:34.509
My name is Matthew Murdock.
I'm your attorney.

42:39.890 --> 42:41.892
[dramatic music playing]
