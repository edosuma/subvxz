Save me, please!

00:40.321 --> 00:44.523
Oh, thank you! Thank you!

00:44.525 --> 00:46.358
Oh, thank you, thank you.

00:46.360 --> 00:48.027
911. What's your emergency?

00:48.029 --> 00:50.929
Sir, please! Please! Please help me!

00:50.931 --> 00:53.899
No, wait! No, you see me.

00:53.901 --> 00:55.167
Please!

01:14.488 --> 01:17.690
I want to get this son of a bitch.

01:17.692 --> 01:19.758
I can't let him win.

01:19.760 --> 01:21.894
You are preaching to the converted.

01:21.896 --> 01:24.930
Peter Lewis isn't just a
distraction, he's a terrorist.

01:24.932 --> 01:28.033
No doubt. Scratch waged
war against the BAU.

01:28.035 --> 01:31.103
But if you have any ideas as to who
might help us win the next battle,

01:31.105 --> 01:32.438
now's the time to share.

01:33.300 --> 01:37.802
You must have a secret
weapon somewhere in there.

01:37.804 --> 01:39.971
Well, I made an offer.

01:39.973 --> 01:41.639
I'm expecting a response tomorrow.

01:41.641 --> 01:44.809
My fingers are crossed it'll be a yes.

01:44.811 --> 01:46.311
No, I'm not gonna give you a name.

01:46.313 --> 01:48.613
Not yet. I don't want to jinx it.

01:48.615 --> 01:52.350
But I can tell you this agent's
been with the Bureau nearly 20 years,

01:52.352 --> 01:55.019
and we met on a case for Interpol.

01:55.021 --> 01:58.056
Well, if you think
they'll fit in with us,

01:58.058 --> 01:59.490
that's all I need to know.

01:59.492 --> 02:01.054
I do.

02:01.681 --> 02:04.381
Does anyone know when agent
fill-in-the-blank is gonna start?

02:04.383 --> 02:08.185
Because I cannot begin my detailed,
rumor-based background check

02:08.187 --> 02:08.997
without a name.

02:09.490 --> 02:11.856
You couldn't find anything
out with all your super powers?

02:11.858 --> 02:12.823
Oh, ha ha, newbie.

02:12.825 --> 02:14.225
It's not like I haven't tried.

02:14.227 --> 02:16.193
I checked with
all the mes in other units

02:16.195 --> 02:17.528
to see if any of their
agents are transferring over.

02:17.530 --> 02:18.996
Nobody knows diddley-squat.

02:18.998 --> 02:21.832
Well, I feel like Emily's been
poring over these resumes forever.

02:21.834 --> 02:24.535
I mean, the brass has to
approve a new agent soon, right?

02:24.537 --> 02:28.739
All I know is, whoever he or
she is, they'd better be nice.

02:28.741 --> 02:30.274
That is the most important thing to me.

02:30.276 --> 02:31.542
To all of us.

02:31.544 --> 02:34.478
Amen. So whoever this
well-qualified mystery person is,

02:34.480 --> 02:36.547
I say once they join,

02:36.549 --> 02:38.115
we change our name

02:38.117 --> 02:41.552
from The Magnificent 7 to The Awesome 8.

02:41.554 --> 02:43.220
Huh? It's perfect.

02:44.524 --> 02:45.856
Maybe. Well...

02:45.858 --> 02:47.091
I don't know.

02:47.093 --> 02:48.359
I'm declaring a dictatorship.

02:48.361 --> 02:51.028
You guys don't get a vote.
Especially you, newbie.

02:51.030 --> 02:54.031
Sorry, guys, no news,
but we have a case.

02:54.033 --> 02:56.033
What?

02:56.035 --> 02:58.702
Oh, yeah, we do. This isn't good.

03:00.873 --> 03:02.773
Any news on the new agent?

03:02.775 --> 03:03.974
Oh. Radio silence.

03:03.976 --> 03:05.276
Let's get started.

03:05.278 --> 03:07.845
Ok, last night in Yakima, Washington,

03:07.847 --> 03:10.381
police received multiple 911 phone calls

03:10.383 --> 03:11.849
from the same neighborhood.

03:11.851 --> 03:16.220
They all reported a woman
pounding on the door,

03:16.222 --> 03:17.988
screaming for help.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.123
She was hysterical.

03:19.125 --> 03:20.958
They received 5 calls
in less than 5 minutes.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.026
Let me guess...
Not one person

03:22.028 --> 03:23.194
opened their door to help her.

03:23.196 --> 03:26.263
Sad commentary on our
times, but understandable.

03:26.265 --> 03:28.065
A stranger at your door could be a ruse

03:28.067 --> 03:29.867
to get into your home to rob you.

03:29.869 --> 03:31.001
Or worse.

03:31.003 --> 03:32.503
All of the callers described the woman

03:32.505 --> 03:34.905
as being in her mid-20s
and scantily clad.

03:34.907 --> 03:36.340
One even called her a prostitute.

03:36.342 --> 03:39.243
Said that a hooded figure
grabbed her off the street,

03:39.245 --> 03:40.778
was driving a dark-colored car.

03:40.780 --> 03:43.514
So we have an abduction.

03:43.516 --> 03:45.716
It appears so, but that not
the only reason they called us.

03:45.718 --> 03:48.018
Right, because when the local police
were looking for the missing woman,

03:48.020 --> 03:51.055
they uncovered the remains
of two female victims

03:51.057 --> 03:53.157
on the bank of a nearby creek.

03:53.159 --> 03:55.726
One was skeletonized, and the
other was in a burlap sack.

03:55.728 --> 03:57.061
She'd been dead for 3 weeks.

03:57.063 --> 04:00.231
She also has barbed wire
wrapped around her waist.

04:00.233 --> 04:03.067
She being Debra McDermott,
27, from Moxee, Washington.

04:03.069 --> 04:07.238
Ran away from home at 16,
multiple arrests for prostitution.

04:07.240 --> 04:09.807
Given the witness statements
for the current missing woman,

04:09.809 --> 04:11.575
I'd say our unsub's got a type.

04:11.577 --> 04:13.077
Any idea on the skeleton?

04:13.079 --> 04:14.411
No, not yet.

04:14.413 --> 04:16.779
But her date of death is
estimated to be 3 years ago.

04:16.781 --> 04:18.214
3 years and now 3 weeks.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.416
What are the odds he remained
dormant between victims?

04:20.418 --> 04:22.987
We should look into recent
local prison releases

04:22.989 --> 04:24.221
that match that timeframe.

04:24.223 --> 04:25.723
I'll search that now.

04:25.725 --> 04:28.259
He could have been sublimating
his urges by reliving the kills.

04:28.261 --> 04:31.395
Maybe he found a job or a
relationship that satisfied him.

04:31.397 --> 04:33.697
If either went sour, that could
have triggered his killing again.

04:33.699 --> 04:34.832
The only thing we know for certain

04:34.834 --> 04:36.000
is we have two dead victims

04:36.002 --> 04:37.701
and a missing woman
who's still out there.

04:37.703 --> 04:39.236
Wheels up in 20.

04:48.681 --> 04:51.348
Go on. Go on.

04:51.350 --> 04:54.852
There it is. There it is.

05:12.660 --> 05:15.361
Synced and corrected by deglinglau
www.addic7ed.com

05:45.678 --> 05:48.527
“God sometimes takes us into
troubled waters,

05:48.529 --> 05:52.431
not to drown us, but to cleanse us.”

05:52.433 --> 05:53.899
Unknown.

05:53.901 --> 05:56.268
The unsub's probably using burlap bags

05:56.270 --> 05:57.836
to easily transport his victims.

05:57.838 --> 05:59.338
You know, burlap's
an interesting choice.

05:59.340 --> 06:01.139
It could also be a
forensic countermeasure.

06:01.141 --> 06:02.107
How so?

06:02.109 --> 06:04.076
Despite its strength, the natural fibers

06:04.078 --> 06:05.911
in burlap break down with groundwater,

06:05.913 --> 06:07.713
exposing the bodies to the elements,

06:07.715 --> 06:09.181
so decomposition happens sooner,

06:09.183 --> 06:12.084
and IDing the bodies would
be harder if not impossible.

06:12.086 --> 06:14.319
So it's exactly what
the unsub would want.

06:14.321 --> 06:17.356
By burying his victims, he's been
able to go undetected for years.

06:17.358 --> 06:20.425
Crime-fighters, I've
ID'd our abducted woman.

06:20.427 --> 06:23.328
Her name is Cheryl “Cherry” Rollins,

06:23.330 --> 06:25.097
25, of Yakima, Washington,

06:25.099 --> 06:26.732
and you were right,
she's a working girl.

06:26.734 --> 06:27.966
How'd they I.D. her?

06:27.968 --> 06:29.568
One of her friends reported her missing,

06:29.570 --> 06:33.405
and I matched a 911 call that
mentioned a very distinctive

06:33.407 --> 06:35.507
and eponymous tattoo on her decolletage.

06:35.509 --> 06:38.877
That means she has a
tattoo of cherries on her...

06:38.879 --> 06:40.345
Yeah. We got it.

06:40.347 --> 06:42.547
Garcia, send us everything
you have on Cherry Rollins,

06:42.549 --> 06:44.683
and tell the Yakima P.D. that
we'll need to talk to her friends.

06:44.685 --> 06:45.984
Copy.

06:45.986 --> 06:48.620
Two out of his 3 victims
are known prostitutes,

06:48.622 --> 06:51.323
so it speaks to his
lack of social skills.

06:51.325 --> 06:53.592
When we land, Tara,
head to the dump site,

06:53.594 --> 06:56.094
JJ, Alvez, talk to the M.E.,

06:56.096 --> 06:59.698
and the rest of us will
set up at the local P.D.

07:02.136 --> 07:05.170
Agent Prentiss, I'm Captain
Ferreri. Thanks for coming in.

07:05.172 --> 07:07.472
Of course.
This is Agent Rossi and Dr. Reid.

07:07.474 --> 07:09.641
Well, it turns out that
friend of Cherry Rollins

07:09.643 --> 07:11.343
doesn't want to come in to talk.

07:11.989 --> 07:13.689
Probably allergic to police stations.

07:13.691 --> 07:15.657
We'll go out and find her.

07:15.659 --> 07:18.026
Sure thing. In the meantime,
we'll set you up in here.

07:18.028 --> 07:19.861
We'll need to see your files

07:19.863 --> 07:21.747
on all the women reported
missing from the area.

07:21.747 --> 07:23.447
Well, “reported” is the key word.

07:23.449 --> 07:26.116
A lot of the time their own family
members don't report them gone.

07:26.118 --> 07:29.353
Most of the missing are
runaways, transients, drug addicts.

07:29.355 --> 07:30.754
They don't leave much of a paper trail.

07:30.756 --> 07:32.489
We'll take what you have.

07:32.491 --> 07:35.325
If he was hiring his
victims before killing them,

07:35.327 --> 07:37.327
we need to figure out
how they were hooking up.

07:37.329 --> 07:39.930
Well, most of the prostitution arrests
happen up on North First Street.

07:39.932 --> 07:42.866
Nowadays, prostitution is
very much an online industry.

07:42.868 --> 07:44.468
Who needs a pimp when you have Wi-Fi?

07:44.470 --> 07:47.504
Yeah, but he was
probably smart enough to avoid

07:47.506 --> 07:49.849
using the Internet smartphone
apps that leave a trail.

07:49.849 --> 07:50.980
Could he be using a burner phone

07:50.980 --> 07:52.626
and a stolen credit card
to hire call girls?

07:52.626 --> 07:53.844
It's possible.

07:53.846 --> 07:54.845
Garcia, are you there?

07:54.847 --> 07:56.480
Yes, on every level of consciousness.

07:56.482 --> 07:57.748
How may I serve?

07:57.750 --> 07:59.950
Do Cherry Rollins or Debra McDermott

07:59.952 --> 08:02.219
have their own websites
advertising their services?

08:02.221 --> 08:04.822
Probing into the belly of the beast now.

08:04.824 --> 08:08.192
And... Oh, there are a
lot of enterprising women,

08:08.194 --> 08:11.528
but I don't see anything
for Debra or Cherry.

08:11.530 --> 08:15.332
I am finding a zero frills
listing of local women

08:15.334 --> 08:17.367
available for, quote,

08:17.369 --> 08:18.936
“no strings attached sex.”

08:18.938 --> 08:20.504
Are they on it?

08:20.506 --> 08:22.339
Maybe. It's gonna take a second, though,

08:22.341 --> 08:23.707
because these women all use nicknames,

08:23.709 --> 08:24.908
and most of their photos

08:24.910 --> 08:27.811
are only showcasing certain body parts.

08:27.813 --> 08:29.813
- Let us know if you find anything.
- Roger that.

08:29.815 --> 08:32.381
Captain, tell us about the creek
where the bodies were found.

08:32.384 --> 08:34.485
Wyler's Creek. It's isolated,

08:34.486 --> 08:36.520
had an unexpected
flash flood 3 days ago.

08:36.522 --> 08:38.889
That's probably what
unearthed the two bodies.

08:38.890 --> 08:40.657
I'd like to set up a
coordinated search grid

08:40.659 --> 08:42.133
for the creek and surrounding area.

08:42.263 --> 08:43.535
I'll get my people on it right away.

08:43.613 --> 08:45.662
Thank you, captain.

08:45.664 --> 08:48.165
Are you thinking he dumped
Cherry at the creek already?

08:48.167 --> 08:49.166
I hope not.

08:49.168 --> 08:50.400
She's been missing less than 12 hours.

08:50.402 --> 08:52.102
We don't know how long he keeps victims

08:52.104 --> 08:53.170
before killing them.

08:53.172 --> 08:55.105
But we do know she was
in fight-or-flight mode

08:55.107 --> 08:59.209
when he caught her. Hopefully that
adrenaline is keeping her alive.

09:05.985 --> 09:07.518
Why are you doing this?

09:07.520 --> 09:11.255
What do you want? Please.

09:11.257 --> 09:13.590
Why did you bring me here?

09:13.592 --> 09:16.727
Answer me, please.

09:16.729 --> 09:19.096
Please, you don't have to do this.

09:19.098 --> 09:21.131
Please!

09:25.037 --> 09:29.273
Our Jane Doe has nicks on her
sternum, clavicle, and rib cage.

09:29.275 --> 09:30.908
C.O.D. was likely exsanguination

09:30.910 --> 09:32.643
due to multiple penetrating wounds,

09:32.645 --> 09:34.811
probably from a pair
of scissors or shears.

09:34.813 --> 09:36.680
Any chance of IDing her through DNA?

09:36.682 --> 09:39.016
It's all on file. I have
to call in a forensic artist

09:39.018 --> 09:40.617
to do a facial reconstruction.

09:40.619 --> 09:43.820
Well, it's been 3 years. Hopefully
someone will recognize her.

09:43.822 --> 09:46.723
Now, what about Debra McDermott,
the victim from 3 weeks ago?

09:46.725 --> 09:49.693
She had deep penetrating
stab wounds as well.

09:49.695 --> 09:52.329
He didn't hesitate.

09:53.666 --> 09:57.034
Her left eye socket looks broken.

09:57.036 --> 09:58.702
And her pelvis.

09:58.704 --> 10:01.471
His rage is escalating.

10:01.473 --> 10:03.307
Any signs of sexual assault?

10:03.309 --> 10:04.708
Decomposition is too great to tell.

10:04.710 --> 10:07.844
However, look at this.

10:07.846 --> 10:10.414
Puncture wounds consistent
with barbed wire.

10:10.416 --> 10:12.916
Yes. Both victims had strands
of it around their bodies.

10:12.918 --> 10:16.453
It could be a restraint or torture.

10:16.455 --> 10:19.256
Or some kind of ritual.

10:19.258 --> 10:23.660
Hey, baby, you want to go out?

10:23.662 --> 10:25.395
- Yeah, look, it's the cops.
- Right. Come on.

10:25.397 --> 10:27.731
Ladies, relax. We're
not trying to jam you up.

10:27.733 --> 10:28.732
Lori Johnson?

10:28.734 --> 10:29.733
Yeah?

10:29.735 --> 10:31.702
Hi. We're from the FBI.

10:31.704 --> 10:33.770
You reported Cherry Rollins missing?

10:33.772 --> 10:36.540
FBI's here about Cherry?

10:36.542 --> 10:38.041
She's really in trouble, isn't she?

10:38.043 --> 10:40.210
You wouldn't be here if she wasn't.

10:40.212 --> 10:41.745
Well, that's what we're
trying to find out.

10:41.747 --> 10:42.913
You two were friends?

10:42.915 --> 10:44.348
This is our spot.

10:44.350 --> 10:46.883
We hang out together.

10:46.885 --> 10:48.385
You get to know a girl that way.

10:48.387 --> 10:50.187
What type of person is she?

10:51.957 --> 10:53.023
Thank you.

10:53.025 --> 10:55.726
Most people, they
don't see us as people.

10:55.728 --> 10:57.828
They think what we do is who we are.

10:57.830 --> 11:00.998
Like I planned to do this for a living.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.035
No way. Me and Cherry, we got plans.

11:05.037 --> 11:06.870
Plans?

11:06.872 --> 11:09.373
Yeah. We're gonna open up a nail salon.

11:09.375 --> 11:11.675
It was her idea.

11:11.677 --> 11:14.311
She's always coming up
with them, like, uh...

11:14.313 --> 11:16.346
Like once she said we
didn't need pimps no more,

11:16.348 --> 11:17.914
that we could look out for each other.

11:17.916 --> 11:20.017
How'd that go over?

11:20.019 --> 11:22.653
I got beat good when I told my man.

11:22.655 --> 11:26.890
But, uh, Cherry said we gotta be strong.

11:26.892 --> 11:28.825
She got some of the
other girls to do it, too.

11:28.827 --> 11:32.429
Did she ever talk about a
customer who made her afraid?

11:32.431 --> 11:35.165
We're talking about a really bad guy,

11:35.167 --> 11:38.602
someone who might be threatening
girls with scissors or a knife.

11:38.604 --> 11:41.838
No. I mean, you get your
weirdos now and then,

11:41.840 --> 11:46.043
but word gets around real
quick about a creep like that.

11:46.045 --> 11:49.346
But, uh, sometimes you don't
know they got a bad attitude

11:49.348 --> 11:50.881
until you're alone with them.

11:50.883 --> 11:52.783
You told the police that
you didn't get a good look

11:52.785 --> 11:55.752
at the last customer who
picked up Cherry that night.

11:55.754 --> 11:57.754
I never seen that car before.

11:59.658 --> 12:00.924
I should've paid more attention.

12:00.926 --> 12:02.759
It's my fault.

12:02.761 --> 12:05.696
Um, she's got a...

12:05.698 --> 12:07.898
She's got a little boy, Christopher.

12:07.900 --> 12:09.700
He lives with Cherry's grandma.

12:09.702 --> 12:12.069
Not many people know
about him, but, uh...

12:13.205 --> 12:14.438
He's what keeps her going.

12:14.440 --> 12:17.974
Whatever money she makes,
she send to her grandmother

12:17.976 --> 12:18.975
to raise that boy.

12:18.977 --> 12:22.846
She loves him more than anything.

12:22.848 --> 12:26.083
You gotta find her.

12:27.186 --> 12:29.886
This place is off the beaten path.

12:29.888 --> 12:32.255
It must mean something to the unsub.

12:32.257 --> 12:35.625
Yeah, well, I bet he
didn't plan on it flooding

12:35.627 --> 12:37.094
and uncovering his secrets.

12:37.096 --> 12:40.731
Man plans and God smiles, hmm?

12:40.733 --> 12:42.933
Yeah.

12:42.935 --> 12:47.170
Well, it's a good thing we're
getting a new member of the team.

12:47.172 --> 12:49.539
Prentiss was unit chief
at Interpol, right?

12:49.541 --> 12:50.974
Mm-hmm.

12:50.976 --> 12:52.609
I'm thinking the new agent

12:52.611 --> 12:54.878
will probably come from
foreign counterintelligence.

12:54.880 --> 12:56.847
It's only natural she'd
want to hire a profiler

12:56.849 --> 12:58.815
she's worked with before.

12:58.817 --> 13:00.484
Yeah, I think she
wants what we all want,

13:00.486 --> 13:02.786
an agent who's the best at what they do

13:02.788 --> 13:04.454
and will help us hunt down Scratch.

13:04.456 --> 13:08.291
Personally, I'll be happy
not to be the new guy anymore.

13:08.293 --> 13:10.293
Whoever comes in gets that title

13:10.295 --> 13:12.863
and Garcia can stop calling me newbie.

13:12.865 --> 13:14.931
Oh, no, see, she is a creature of habit.

13:14.933 --> 13:17.000
I think you're stuck
with that one, newbie.

13:22.741 --> 13:24.541
JJ, I've got something.

13:24.543 --> 13:27.177
Yeah, me, too.

13:30.048 --> 13:33.183
Hey. Over here.

13:45.117 --> 13:47.430
There you are.

13:47.432 --> 13:48.932
I was getting lonely.

13:48.934 --> 13:52.202
Listen, you told me your
name when we were in the car,

13:52.204 --> 13:53.870
but I'm real lousy with names.

13:53.872 --> 13:55.572
What is it again?

13:55.574 --> 13:58.241
We can do this. Whatever
you want, just say it.

13:58.243 --> 14:01.011
Tell me how you like it, babe.

14:01.013 --> 14:03.513
No! No!

14:03.515 --> 14:05.015
No! No! No!

14:05.017 --> 14:06.683
Hey, hey! We don't have to.

14:06.685 --> 14:08.185
Not if you don't want to.

14:08.187 --> 14:09.586
We could talk instead.

14:09.588 --> 14:11.288
Is this your farm?

14:11.290 --> 14:12.722
Did you grow up here?

14:12.724 --> 14:15.025
Me, I... I grew up in Union Gap.

14:15.027 --> 14:16.860
Hey, it's gonna be ok.

14:16.862 --> 14:18.295
I got a little boy.

14:18.297 --> 14:22.098
He's 5. Whenever he's upset or scared,

14:22.100 --> 14:23.733
sometimes we go for a walk.

14:23.735 --> 14:25.602
You and me, we could do that.

14:25.604 --> 14:28.405
Huh? We could go for a
walk and we could do that.

14:28.407 --> 14:30.073
I'm not a little boy.

14:30.075 --> 14:32.375
No! Please, Dad.

14:32.377 --> 14:33.543
Don't make me.

14:33.545 --> 14:36.313
Daddy, don't make me do it!

14:41.186 --> 14:46.456
Take your team to
section 2-G, south embankment.

14:46.458 --> 14:48.725
Ground-penetrating radar
equipment just arrived.

14:49.728 --> 14:50.727
JJ?

14:50.729 --> 14:52.395
Where?

14:52.397 --> 14:53.897
We're on our way.

14:53.899 --> 14:55.031
Let me guess.

14:55.033 --> 14:57.367
JJ and Alvez just found two more bodies.

14:57.369 --> 14:59.703
With the number of remains
we've unearthed here,

14:59.705 --> 15:01.471
we're getting into double digits.

15:01.473 --> 15:04.207
This unsub didn't wait
3 years between kills.

15:04.209 --> 15:07.611
No. He's been at it the whole time.

15:21.117 --> 15:23.450
It's like the Green River
killings all over again.

15:23.452 --> 15:26.053
Yeah. New York's got
a similar serial killer

15:26.055 --> 15:28.022
operating along the
beach on Long Island.

15:28.024 --> 15:30.824
Multiple victims, most
of the sex workers,

15:30.826 --> 15:32.593
and some of them wrapped in burlap.

15:32.595 --> 15:34.188
They haven't caught that guy.

15:34.188 --> 15:35.576
Well, maybe he moved out here.

15:35.576 --> 15:37.693
Garcia can look into
overlap on the timeline.

15:38.025 --> 15:39.640
Agents.

15:41.152 --> 15:42.919
If I had to guess, I'd say the victim

15:42.921 --> 15:45.655
Agent Jareau found was
killed at least 5 years ago.

15:45.657 --> 15:46.890
5?

15:46.892 --> 15:49.592
We thought the earliest
victim was from 3 years ago.

15:49.594 --> 15:51.316
What about her?

15:53.164 --> 15:54.964
She was stabbed like the others.

15:54.966 --> 15:58.768
Based on decomp, it appears
she was killed recently.

15:58.770 --> 15:59.869
I'd say 10 days ago.

15:59.871 --> 16:01.671
Allison Carson, 24.

16:01.673 --> 16:03.806
Family reported her missing 10 days ago.

16:03.808 --> 16:07.176
So the unsub didn't hold
Allison for any length of time.

16:07.178 --> 16:08.878
He killed her and most
likely all of his victims

16:08.880 --> 16:10.313
right after meeting them.

16:10.315 --> 16:13.583
We have evidence that some of
the victims have bled out here.

16:13.585 --> 16:15.518
And we've disturbed his
burial and killing grounds.

16:15.520 --> 16:16.686
He's not coming back.

16:16.688 --> 16:18.321
It means he's probably
keeping Cherry Rollins

16:18.323 --> 16:21.157
alive in a secluded place
while he looks for a new site.

16:21.159 --> 16:23.960
Or until his need to kill
again becomes too great.

16:23.962 --> 16:28.364
Look at how he's wrapped the
burlap and barbed wire around her.

16:28.366 --> 16:30.700
I know what he's doing.

16:30.702 --> 16:34.337
We should deliver the profile.

16:34.339 --> 16:37.540
We are looking for a white
male, 30 to 40 years old,

16:37.542 --> 16:39.742
who's been targeting female sex workers.

16:39.744 --> 16:42.178
He appears to be
a mission-oriented moral enforcer

16:42.180 --> 16:44.881
who may be forcing his
victims to wear a cilice

16:44.883 --> 16:47.250
made of of burlap and
fastened with barbed wire.

16:47.252 --> 16:48.551
What's a cilice?

16:48.553 --> 16:50.486
Originally it was a
garment made of coarse cloth

16:50.488 --> 16:52.655
or animal hair, used in
some religious traditions

16:52.657 --> 16:55.825
to induce pain or discomfort
as a sign of repentance and atonement.

16:55.827 --> 16:59.429
He may be projecting his own
sexual desires onto his victims.

16:59.431 --> 17:01.831
He's punishing them because
he wants to have sex with them,

17:01.833 --> 17:04.534
but because of his
upbringing, he can't or won't.

17:04.536 --> 17:06.970
His use of barbed wire
could be a way of inflicting

17:06.972 --> 17:09.872
more punishment on his
victims before killing them.

17:09.874 --> 17:12.407
His guilt-ridden love
map was likely formed

17:12.410 --> 17:14.444
during his childhood and adolescence.

17:14.445 --> 17:16.212
He might have grown up in
a conservative household

17:16.214 --> 17:20.016
and had a parent or teacher
that was strict and overbearing.

17:22.454 --> 17:25.555
He's driving a dark-colored car and
cruising the streets for his victims.

17:25.557 --> 17:27.056
But because he has been able to dispose

17:27.058 --> 17:29.659
of his victims undetected for
years, he's comfortable here.

17:29.661 --> 17:31.594
He most likely lives
or works in the area.

17:31.596 --> 17:33.896
Sex workers should be warned
and advised to use caution.

17:33.898 --> 17:35.732
And until we find Cherry Rollins,

17:35.734 --> 17:39.435
we will be maintaining round-the-clock
police presence here at the creek.

17:39.437 --> 17:41.371
Thank you.

17:41.373 --> 17:44.774
The unsub must know we're here.

17:44.776 --> 17:46.976
You have to wonder what
effect it's having on him.

17:46.978 --> 17:49.612
Unfortunately, it just
may send him over the edge.

17:49.614 --> 17:53.316
And if it does, what
does that mean for Cherry?

17:53.318 --> 17:55.485
You're upset.

17:55.487 --> 17:59.255
Parents, they can do
a real number on you.

17:59.257 --> 18:03.326
I should know.
My mom ran off when I was 10.

18:03.328 --> 18:06.896
Left me behind with an uncle.

18:06.898 --> 18:08.865
When he was done with me,

18:08.867 --> 18:12.135
he passed me around to his buddies.

18:12.137 --> 18:14.871
So what did your daddy make you do?

18:14.873 --> 18:17.173
Shut up!

18:17.175 --> 18:21.711
Don't you talk about him.

18:21.713 --> 18:26.082
Do as I say, boy.

18:30.021 --> 18:31.254
Aah!

18:46.438 --> 18:49.172
Cherry Rollins was 12 when
she was put into foster care

18:49.174 --> 18:51.708
after reports of physical abuse at home.

18:51.710 --> 18:53.242
At 15 she dropped out of school

18:53.244 --> 18:54.711
and she's been on her own ever since.

18:54.713 --> 18:56.279
The way Cherry's friend
talked about her,

18:56.281 --> 18:58.347
it made her sound like she
has a lot of street smarts.

18:58.349 --> 19:00.650
And the fact that she
organized other prostitutes

19:00.652 --> 19:03.553
despite the threat of
violence from their pimps...

19:03.555 --> 19:05.488
That sort of life takes
strong survival skills...

19:05.490 --> 19:08.491
You need the ability to size up any
situation, act quickly, think on your feet.

19:08.493 --> 19:11.027
Cherry's probably talked herself
out of trouble more than once.

19:11.029 --> 19:13.529
Not to mention she's a mother.
It's gonna keep her fighting.

19:13.531 --> 19:16.966
We can rule out the Long Island
serial killer as our unsub.

19:16.968 --> 19:22.305
Garcia found definite overlap between
the East Coast and Yakima victims.

19:22.307 --> 19:25.108
Ok. The cilice, the barbed wire,

19:25.110 --> 19:28.010
disposal of the bodies
in burlap bags near water,

19:28.012 --> 19:30.546
that all indicates ritualistic behavior.

19:30.548 --> 19:32.181
There are no markings on the burlap

19:32.183 --> 19:34.183
and nothing special
about the barbed wire.

19:34.185 --> 19:36.119
You can buy both of
them just about anywhere.

19:36.121 --> 19:37.353
Yeah, they're universally found

19:37.355 --> 19:39.288
on farms, ranches, garden centers.

19:39.290 --> 19:41.124
The local Public Works
Department could be using

19:41.126 --> 19:43.025
burlap sacks for help
with road flooding.

19:43.027 --> 19:45.895
You said the cilice has a
religious connection, huh?

19:45.897 --> 19:48.564
Maybe our unsub's a
member of the clergy.

19:48.566 --> 19:51.868
Opus Dei. It's connected to
the Roman Catholic Church.

19:51.870 --> 19:53.369
It's frowned upon, but some members

19:53.371 --> 19:55.238
still practice
mortification of the flesh.

19:55.240 --> 19:58.808
Currently there are 60 Opus
Dei centers in 19 U.S. cities,

19:58.810 --> 20:00.777
but none in Washington state.
It might be someone

20:00.779 --> 20:02.979
just fascinated by or
obsessed with medieval torture.

20:02.981 --> 20:04.080
Garcia?

20:04.082 --> 20:06.082
Let me dazzle you with my brilliance.

20:06.084 --> 20:08.384
We're looking for individuals
or groups in the area

20:08.386 --> 20:10.520
that may practice
corporal mortification.

20:10.522 --> 20:11.821
Corporal what, come again?

20:11.823 --> 20:14.257
Basically it involves
causing yourself physical pain

20:14.259 --> 20:15.725
in the search for spiritual growth.

20:15.727 --> 20:18.060
Seriously? Has no one
heard of meditation?

20:18.062 --> 20:19.462
Go on.

20:19.464 --> 20:22.165
Check social media sites,
religious groups, self-help blogs,

20:22.167 --> 20:24.700
anyone who's using burlap,
barbed wire, and water

20:24.702 --> 20:25.835
or a combination of the 3

20:25.837 --> 20:28.404
in their quest for
penance and self-sacrifice.

20:28.406 --> 20:29.806
Ok. I got a local thing

20:29.808 --> 20:33.342
called Tue Believers, sort
of a loose-knit faith group

20:33.344 --> 20:34.944
that subscribes to fasting, abstinence,

20:34.946 --> 20:38.281
and ritual cleansing in order
to live a righteous life.

20:38.283 --> 20:40.116
Do they have a headquarters in Yakima?

20:40.118 --> 20:42.351
I wouldn't call it that. More like
they meet in someone's living room.

20:42.353 --> 20:44.453
We need an address and
a membership roster.

20:44.455 --> 20:45.454
Coming right up.

20:46.524 --> 20:48.257
Alvez, Reid, go see if you can talk

20:48.259 --> 20:51.828
to this group's leader. Maybe
our unsub is one of the faithful.

20:51.830 --> 20:53.362
So the creek's been thoroughly searched.

20:53.364 --> 20:55.064
We're confident there
aren't any more bodies.

20:55.066 --> 20:57.967
So this victim from 5 years
ago is most likely his first.

20:57.969 --> 20:59.702
All right, what can you tell me?

20:59.704 --> 21:01.604
Well, she's probably
in her early to mid-20s,

21:01.606 --> 21:04.240
about 5'5”, with healthy bone density

21:04.242 --> 21:05.875
and excellent dental work.

21:05.877 --> 21:09.011
That's not something you
normally see in a prostitute.

21:09.013 --> 21:11.681
She was also stabbed at least 50 times,

21:11.683 --> 21:13.416
more than any of the other victims.

21:13.418 --> 21:15.384
Overkill. He probably knew her.

21:15.386 --> 21:19.088
She may even be the
original focus of his rage.

21:19.090 --> 21:22.558
Uh, was this found with her remains?

21:22.560 --> 21:24.393
Yeah.

21:30.468 --> 21:33.803
Well, whatever was inside are long gone.

21:33.805 --> 21:35.571
We'll try and I.D. her
through dental work.

21:35.573 --> 21:38.541
Another artist facial reconstruction.

21:40.912 --> 21:45.414
Wow. You are a brave man, Rossi.

21:45.416 --> 21:49.318
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

21:49.320 --> 21:51.320
Something on your mind?

21:51.322 --> 21:54.156
I just can't stop thinking about
Scratch's attack on my family.

21:54.158 --> 21:57.560
I was just too distracted
to be much help.

21:57.562 --> 21:59.829
No. Don't even go there.

21:59.831 --> 22:03.032
If we'd caught him then, we wouldn't
be trying to hire another agent now.

22:03.034 --> 22:04.333
Emily wanted to add someone

22:04.335 --> 22:06.535
before he attacked you and your brother.

22:06.537 --> 22:08.204
Scratch made it personal again,

22:08.206 --> 22:09.906
which only expedited her search.

22:09.908 --> 22:11.040
Yeah, I suppose.

22:11.042 --> 22:13.576
But the good news is
we know his pattern.

22:13.578 --> 22:16.045
He'll go quiet because he needs the time

22:16.047 --> 22:17.647
to plan his next assault on us.

22:17.649 --> 22:21.617
Yeah. And then we can use his
meticulous nature against him

22:21.619 --> 22:23.653
and it'll give us time
to get ahead of his plan.

22:23.655 --> 22:26.389
Absolutely.

22:29.627 --> 22:32.561
What was that about desperate times?

22:32.563 --> 22:36.732
Turns out I'm not that desperate.

22:36.734 --> 22:40.436
I pray that each of your
stories ends on a happy note.

22:40.438 --> 22:43.205
Happy note, happy note.

22:49.447 --> 22:52.114
Oh, dear.

22:55.653 --> 22:56.852
Yeah, Garcia.

22:56.854 --> 22:58.688
I come bearing sad news
of the sleuthing kind.

22:58.690 --> 23:00.957
That gold locket
belonged to Wendy Baldwin,

23:00.959 --> 23:03.659
local girl. She was 20 years old

23:03.661 --> 23:06.128
when she went missing
5 years ago this month.

23:06.130 --> 23:07.563
Well, the timeline matches up.

23:07.565 --> 23:08.664
Who reported her missing?

23:08.666 --> 23:10.766
Her parents, Gary and Anne Baldwin.

23:10.768 --> 23:13.002
They own a local feed and supply store.

23:13.004 --> 23:14.704
Was Wendy involved in prostitution?

23:14.706 --> 23:16.272
No. There's no sign of that.

23:16.274 --> 23:17.907
Any drug use? Behavioral problems?

23:17.909 --> 23:19.208
Not that I can see.

23:19.210 --> 23:21.911
What I can see is that
she was on the Dean's list

23:21.913 --> 23:22.979
at her college.

23:22.981 --> 23:25.114
She was the treasurer of her 4-H,

23:25.116 --> 23:26.716
and she worked at her family business.

23:26.718 --> 23:27.783
Thanks, Penelope.

23:27.785 --> 23:29.685
Anytime, anything, anywhere.

23:29.687 --> 23:31.287
Wendy was his first victim.

23:31.289 --> 23:33.589
Because of the overkill,
we said he probably knew her.

23:33.591 --> 23:35.358
Yeah, he didn't pick
her up on the streets,

23:35.360 --> 23:37.560
and they most likely
met at school or work.

23:37.562 --> 23:38.861
Well, if that's the case,

23:38.863 --> 23:42.231
the Baldwins might have an
idea as to who that could be.

23:56.615 --> 23:59.656
We're so sorry for
your loss, Mrs. Baldwin.

23:59.656 --> 24:03.404
I know this is difficult, but, uh,
can we ask you a few more questions?

24:05.157 --> 24:09.919
Was Wendy having problems or arguing
with anyone before she disappeared?

24:09.919 --> 24:13.365
A friend, a classmate,
or customer at the store?

24:13.487 --> 24:15.921
No, nothing like that.
She would have mentioned it.

24:15.923 --> 24:17.890
Did she have a boyfriend?

24:17.892 --> 24:20.893
Some of the local boys would
take her out to the movies

24:20.895 --> 24:23.962
or out for a burger, but that was it.

24:23.964 --> 24:25.631
So nothing serious?

24:25.633 --> 24:27.666
She was too busy with school.

24:27.668 --> 24:30.269
She was gonna be a vet,

24:30.271 --> 24:33.405
set up a practice in town and...

24:33.407 --> 24:37.276
She kept a picture of Sonny, our dog,

24:37.278 --> 24:42.080
and Jojo, her pet pig, in her locket.

24:44.552 --> 24:48.453
She loved animals and helping people.

24:48.455 --> 24:51.089
My husband and I would joke that...

24:51.091 --> 24:53.592
Some of the customers
would order supplies

24:53.594 --> 24:58.463
that they didn't really need
so they could talk to Wendy.

24:58.465 --> 25:01.900
Mrs. Baldwin, could we take a
look at your customer records?

25:01.902 --> 25:04.903
I guess that would be ok.

25:04.905 --> 25:07.372
I'm sorry, we haven't gone digital.

25:07.374 --> 25:09.041
No problem.

25:09.043 --> 25:11.476
But you really don't think
that one of our neighbors

25:11.478 --> 25:14.479
killed our daughter, do you?

25:18.564 --> 25:21.787
Hi, Mom. I was gonna call you a
little bit later. How are you...

25:21.789 --> 25:23.355
What?

25:23.357 --> 25:26.725
Who's missing?

25:26.727 --> 25:29.928
No, Mom.
Pat and Grace live in Las Vegas.

25:29.930 --> 25:34.266
You're in Houston,
at the Anderson clinic.

25:34.268 --> 25:37.869
We moved there last month, remember?

25:37.871 --> 25:39.810
Yeah, in Texas.

25:41.942 --> 25:45.077
Absolutely. A nap sounds
like a really great idea.

25:45.079 --> 25:47.579
Why don't you get a little bit of rest

25:47.581 --> 25:49.781
and I'm gonna call you back later, ok?

25:49.783 --> 25:53.085
All right. I love you.

25:56.423 --> 25:58.123
Is everything all right?

25:58.125 --> 26:00.092
It's my mom.

26:00.094 --> 26:01.860
She was confused.

26:01.862 --> 26:03.428
There she was and she was convinced

26:03.430 --> 26:05.330
that her friends had been kidnapped.

26:05.332 --> 26:06.598
She wanted us to investigate.

26:06.600 --> 26:08.567
Spence, I'm sorry.

26:08.569 --> 26:09.768
This was my biggest fear,

26:09.770 --> 26:12.704
you know, about getting
her into the clinical trial.

26:12.706 --> 26:14.706
I think she's getting a placebo.

26:14.708 --> 26:16.408
But you said she was getting better.

26:16.410 --> 26:18.577
She was. Or I... I was... I don't know,

26:18.579 --> 26:20.545
I was fooling myself into thinking that.

26:20.547 --> 26:22.848
Maybe I wanted to believe it so much

26:22.850 --> 26:24.850
that I was experiencing
the placebo effect, too.

26:24.852 --> 26:28.887
Is there anything I can do?

26:28.889 --> 26:31.823
I don't know.

26:32.960 --> 26:35.961
I'm sorry.

26:50.577 --> 26:52.277
Please, no.

26:52.279 --> 26:53.512
Please.

26:54.782 --> 26:57.382
Please, no. My son needs me.

26:57.384 --> 26:59.384
Please, I don't want him
to grow up like his father!

26:59.386 --> 27:03.321
Remember what your father did to you?

27:19.473 --> 27:20.439
Fornicator!

27:20.441 --> 27:22.074
Who's your dirty little whore?

27:22.076 --> 27:24.509
- Carly! She's not...
- Shut up!

27:24.511 --> 27:27.079
Girls like that are diseased, unclean,

27:27.081 --> 27:29.548
they will lead you
down into the darkness

27:29.550 --> 27:33.385
where your soul will be
damned for all eternity.

27:33.387 --> 27:35.787
You hear me?!

27:39.660 --> 27:41.293
- Put it on.
- No!

27:42.396 --> 27:44.296
Do as I say, boy.

27:44.298 --> 27:46.465
Leave me alone.

27:59.980 --> 28:02.681
Christopher, I'm so sorry.

28:02.683 --> 28:05.584
Mommy's so sorry. I love you so much.

28:05.586 --> 28:07.052
I hope you know that.

28:07.054 --> 28:10.222
Maybe one day you'll understand
why I did what I had to do.

28:10.224 --> 28:14.159
Please, God, take care
of my baby, please.

28:40.261 --> 28:43.596
That's the last box of customer
records from the Baldwin store.

28:43.598 --> 28:44.579
- Thanks, Terry.
- Yep.

28:44.838 --> 28:47.135
You sure you don't need any help
going through all this material?

28:47.239 --> 28:48.292
I'm ok. Thanks, though.

28:48.292 --> 28:51.337
Suit yourself.

29:09.457 --> 29:11.894
Hi, Mom. I was gonna call you a
little bit later. How are you...

29:14.213 --> 29:15.629
What?

29:16.529 --> 29:17.589
No, Mom.

29:17.675 --> 29:19.741
Pat and Grace live in Las Vegas.

29:19.743 --> 29:24.112
You're in Houston, at
the Anderson clinic.

29:24.114 --> 29:26.415
You moved there last month, remember?

29:34.925 --> 29:40.095
What did your father make you do?

29:40.097 --> 29:42.197
You can tell me.

29:45.636 --> 29:48.336
Atone.

29:50.641 --> 29:55.143
He would take me out to the cornfield...

29:55.167 --> 29:56.899
_

29:57.260 --> 29:59.614
Leave me there.

29:59.616 --> 30:03.051
Wouldn't come back until the next day.

30:07.157 --> 30:10.425
Aah!

30:19.970 --> 30:22.804
I'm sorry that he did that to you.

30:24.641 --> 30:27.476
But you found a way to survive.

30:27.478 --> 30:32.714
Sometimes that's all we can do.

30:32.716 --> 30:34.583
Going through the Baldwins records,

30:34.585 --> 30:36.852
I found 3 customers who for years

30:36.854 --> 30:38.487
bought supplies on a regular basis.

30:38.489 --> 30:39.988
That all abruptly ended around the time

30:39.990 --> 30:41.356
of Wendy Baldwin's disappearance.

30:41.358 --> 30:44.059
The first is Bertram Foley.

30:44.061 --> 30:45.994
Garcia, what have you got on him?

30:45.996 --> 30:48.029
The Foley ranch raises
horses and grass-fed cattle,

30:48.031 --> 30:50.966
and Mr. Fo... No, it's not him.

30:50.968 --> 30:52.267
How do you know?

30:52.269 --> 30:53.468
I don't mean to be unkind.
I'm sure he could do

30:53.470 --> 30:54.703
all kinds of nefarious things,

30:54.705 --> 30:57.472
but he's the spry age of
80 and in a wheelchair.

30:57.474 --> 30:59.241
Let's see, next up we have Fred Haven.

30:59.243 --> 31:01.777
Fred Haven. 35 years old,

31:01.779 --> 31:04.412
was the owner of the Haven
orchards and apple farm.

31:04.414 --> 31:05.380
Was?

31:05.382 --> 31:07.549
Yeah. The bank foreclosed on it

31:07.551 --> 31:10.085
one month before Wendy went missing.

31:10.087 --> 31:11.620
Well, if Haven was
having money problems,

31:11.622 --> 31:12.821
that could have been the stressor.

31:12.823 --> 31:15.490
Ok. He and his wife filed
for divorce soon after.

31:15.492 --> 31:16.892
That could have been the trigger.

31:16.894 --> 31:17.959
Where's Haven now?

31:17.961 --> 31:18.927
Uh...

31:18.929 --> 31:21.229
Oh... he's serving 7 to 9 years

31:21.231 --> 31:22.631
at the Federal Detention
Center at SeaTac.

31:22.633 --> 31:23.665
Who does that leave?

31:23.667 --> 31:25.133
Last up we have Kevin Decker.

31:25.135 --> 31:27.435
Customer records show him
at the store every week.

31:27.437 --> 31:30.405
I got a John Decker.
He owns a small farm

31:30.407 --> 31:32.674
next to the Baldwin store.

31:32.676 --> 31:35.076
Oh... his son, Kevin, is 28 years old.

31:35.078 --> 31:36.745
The father's name sounds familiar.

31:36.747 --> 31:38.613
What do we know about them, Garcia?

31:38.615 --> 31:40.549
Father and son both live on a farm.

31:40.551 --> 31:43.752
Wife Susan Decker died in childbirth.

31:43.754 --> 31:46.288
Oh, snap. John Decker is
a member of true believers.

31:46.290 --> 31:47.889
That's right. He was inactive.

31:47.891 --> 31:50.992
Probably because the group
was more mainstream Bible study

31:50.994 --> 31:52.527
and less fire and brimstone.

31:52.529 --> 31:54.796
He might have felt they
weren't righteous enough for him

31:54.798 --> 31:56.298
and took matters into his own hands.

31:56.300 --> 31:58.266
- We need an address.
- Sending it.

31:58.268 --> 32:01.036
Reid, find Lewis, get back up to
the creek in case he shows up there.

32:01.038 --> 32:03.805
Wait. John Decker fell
of the grid 5 years ago.

32:03.807 --> 32:05.907
No credit card activity, no phone calls,

32:05.909 --> 32:08.977
he didn't even renew his driver's
license. He completely vanished.

32:08.979 --> 32:12.280
Garcia, what color car
does Kevin Decker drive?

32:12.282 --> 32:14.149
Dark blue.

32:15.552 --> 32:18.587
I didn't want this kind of life.

32:18.589 --> 32:21.623
I'm so ashamed.

32:21.625 --> 32:24.125
You are?

32:28.365 --> 32:31.166
I know I must atone.

32:31.168 --> 32:33.134
Will you help me?

32:33.136 --> 32:35.871
Y-yes.

32:37.474 --> 32:39.174
Untie me.

32:39.176 --> 32:42.544
And you can show me how.

32:56.793 --> 32:59.361
Thank you.

33:00.697 --> 33:02.998
I'm ready.

33:12.709 --> 33:14.376
Aah!

33:14.378 --> 33:15.410
Aah!

33:29.262 --> 33:31.830
His father believed in
extremely humiliating punishment

33:31.855 --> 33:35.957
and Kevin Decker suffered years of
physical and psychological abuse.

33:35.959 --> 33:37.992
Thank you. According to Mrs. Baldwin,

33:37.994 --> 33:40.128
Kevin told them his
father suffered a stroke

33:40.130 --> 33:42.663
and moved to a nursing
facility out of state.

33:42.665 --> 33:44.665
But Garcia couldn't
find any trace of him.

33:44.667 --> 33:46.067
Kevin probably killed his father,

33:46.069 --> 33:48.336
suffering a psychotic
break in the process.

33:48.338 --> 33:51.239
Mrs. Baldwin also said their
daughter felt sorry for Kevin

33:51.241 --> 33:53.541
and was about the only one
who was truly kind to him.

33:53.543 --> 33:56.477
He could have mistaken her
kindness as sexual aggression.

33:56.479 --> 33:58.780
It may have brought out
feelings of shame and guilt

33:58.782 --> 34:00.681
over his desires for her.

34:00.683 --> 34:03.317
So with his father's dogma
about morality in his head,

34:03.319 --> 34:05.686
he kills Wendy, then
turns turns his rage

34:05.688 --> 34:09.190
towards other women he views
as loose and amoral prostitutes.

34:38.888 --> 34:41.054
No, no, please stop!

34:41.056 --> 34:43.558
Please, no!

35:07.283 --> 35:10.852
You have to be cleansed before you die.

35:13.123 --> 35:15.756
Kevin Decker, FBI!

35:16.926 --> 35:18.192
Stay where you are!

35:18.194 --> 35:19.694
It's ok. It's ok. You're safe.

35:19.696 --> 35:21.429
It's ok.

35:30.807 --> 35:33.474
Kevin, we're coming in!

35:35.145 --> 35:38.379
Kevin, put the shears down.

35:38.381 --> 35:40.781
Do you know what I did?

35:42.619 --> 35:44.986
We know what your father did to you.

35:50.560 --> 35:52.827
I must atone.

35:52.829 --> 35:55.830
Kevin, we can help you with that.

35:55.832 --> 35:57.331
Just put the shears down.

35:57.333 --> 35:59.534
Now, just put them down.

36:03.439 --> 36:05.006
That's right.

36:05.008 --> 36:07.275
Nice and easy.

36:15.752 --> 36:18.152
I'm sorry.

36:18.154 --> 36:19.520
No, Kevin!

36:19.522 --> 36:21.322
No!

36:25.695 --> 36:28.296
Go, go, go!

37:40.252 --> 37:41.252
Coffee?

37:41.253 --> 37:43.577
Oh, you are a lifesaver.

37:48.177 --> 37:50.577
What's going on?

37:50.579 --> 37:53.079
I need to take some time off.

37:54.683 --> 37:56.616
Ok. When?

37:56.618 --> 37:58.985
As soon as we get back.

37:58.987 --> 38:01.154
I normally wouldn't do this,

38:01.156 --> 38:02.589
especially with
everything we have going on

38:02.591 --> 38:03.757
and the new agent,

38:03.759 --> 38:06.092
but it's my mom.

38:06.094 --> 38:09.095
I don't think the clinical
trials are helping her.

38:09.097 --> 38:11.998
Spence, I'm so sorry.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.767
I need to see for myself

38:13.769 --> 38:15.101
what's happening in Houston,

38:15.103 --> 38:16.636
and, you know, talk to the doctors,

38:16.638 --> 38:18.104
try to figure out what's next.

38:18.106 --> 38:19.105
As you should.

38:19.107 --> 38:21.308
Listen, we'll be fine.

38:21.310 --> 38:23.343
You take as long as you need.

38:23.345 --> 38:24.778
Thank you.

38:24.780 --> 38:25.979
I have one condition.

38:25.981 --> 38:28.949
I need you to check in
every day, no matter what.

38:28.951 --> 38:30.884
I need to know you're ok.

38:32.287 --> 38:35.222
It's understood.

38:37.693 --> 38:38.658
I don't...

38:38.660 --> 38:41.228
I don't know how to fix this.

38:55.010 --> 38:58.011
How long is Reid going to be in Houston?

38:58.013 --> 39:00.914
I told him to take as long as
he needs to be with his mom.

39:00.916 --> 39:03.216
It's gotta be tough on the kid.

39:03.218 --> 39:04.384
I can only imagine.

39:04.386 --> 39:08.088
Now, it's not too late.

39:08.090 --> 39:10.590
Anybody else for a round at O'Keefe's?

39:10.592 --> 39:11.191
I'm in.

39:11.303 --> 39:11.992
I'm buyin'.

39:12.014 --> 39:13.060
Buying what?

39:13.094 --> 39:13.961
Drinks at O'Keefe's.

39:14.008 --> 39:16.162
Huzzah. I'll go get my things.

39:16.164 --> 39:18.598
Anybody know who this is?

39:23.772 --> 39:25.105
Stephen?

39:28.544 --> 39:31.912
I thought I'd check out where we
keep the paper clips around here.

39:31.914 --> 39:33.179
You gotta be kidding me.

39:33.181 --> 39:35.582
Stephen Walker, how you been?

39:35.584 --> 39:37.584
Never better, Dave. Never better.

39:37.586 --> 39:39.286
Is this your secret weapon?

39:39.288 --> 39:41.388
Yeah. I told you I
didn't want to jinx it.

39:41.390 --> 39:44.758
Everyone, I'd like you to meet
SSA Stephen Walker from the B.A.P.

39:44.760 --> 39:46.927
Agent Prentiss knows this,

39:46.929 --> 39:50.063
but I have followed and admired
the work of the BAU for years.

39:50.065 --> 39:52.465
So when she called and
asked me to join the team,

39:52.467 --> 39:54.601
the answer was easy.

39:54.603 --> 39:56.202
So I take it this is a yes.

39:56.204 --> 39:59.372
Well, I thought I'd call, but
they said you had just landed.

39:59.374 --> 40:01.608
Let me be the first to welcome you.

40:01.610 --> 40:03.209
Hey, you're forgetting something.

40:03.211 --> 40:04.811
I'm forgetting nothing, newbie.

40:04.813 --> 40:06.246
Told ya.

40:06.248 --> 40:09.115
I only ask that you allow a day or two

40:09.117 --> 40:10.450
before the hazing begins.

40:10.452 --> 40:12.085
Oh, come on, a whole day?

40:12.087 --> 40:13.620
Tough ask, boss.

40:14.590 --> 40:16.489
Welcome aboard, Stephen.

40:16.491 --> 40:17.958
I appreciate that.

40:17.960 --> 40:18.959
Luke Alvez.

40:18.961 --> 40:20.260
Hello, Luke.

40:20.262 --> 40:21.428
Hey. JJ.

40:21.430 --> 40:23.863
“Sometimes good things fall apart

40:23.865 --> 40:27.133
so better things can fall together.”
