14:29.994 --> 14:33.032
IN A FEVV MOMENTS, TVVO MEN ARE
GOING TO ARRIVE THERE. SPIES.

14:33.081 --> 14:36.699
AND THEY ARE
TO BE SHOT ON SIGHT.

14:36.793 --> 14:40.286
THEIR NAMES ARE
TABAL AND GARCIA.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.748
I KNOW WHO THEY ARE!
AND I KNOW WHATTHEY ARE!

14:43.841 --> 14:45.832
AND THEY ARE TO BE SHOT!

14:49.013 --> 14:51.050
THAT'S RIGHT.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.222
YOU LET ME KNOW
WHEN IT'S DONE.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.308
CRISTO.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.895
SIR?

15:05.988 --> 15:08.400
ANY COMPLAINTS?

15:10.618 --> 15:13.736
NONE.

15:13.830 --> 15:16.743
NONE, HUH?

15:16.833 --> 15:18.995
WHY SHOULD THERE BE?

15:20.920 --> 15:23.082
A PIE CUT
INTO TWO PIECES

15:23.131 --> 15:25.839
IS BETTER THAN A
PIE CUT IN FIVE, HM?

15:25.925 --> 15:28.667
PIE. PIE.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.139
THIS IS NO PIE. THESE
ARE THE LIVES OF FRIENDS.

15:31.222 --> 15:34.510
THEY WERE...THEY
WERE VERY CLOSE.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.638
VVE VVERE \/ERY CLOSE. YOU KNOVV THAT.
VVE VVERE LIKE BROTHERS.

15:37.728 --> 15:40.971
SEE, THAT'S VVHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOVV IT IS

15:41.065 --> 15:43.773
THAT I COULD CRUSH THEM OUT,
AND I DON'T THINK ABOUT IT,

15:43.860 --> 15:46.693
I DON'T FEEL IT.
I JUST CRUSH THEM.

15:46.779 --> 15:50.989
MEN CANNOT BE BROTHERS
AND ASSASSINS.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.743
YOU MUST EXPECT
THIS FROM NOW ON.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.999
<i>WHEN A MAN HAS POWER,</i>

16:01.085 --> 16:03.122

<i>AND NOW YOU
HAVE ENEMIES.</i>

16:06.007 --> 16:09.375
ENEMIES, YES, I UNDERSTAND THAT,
BUT MUST MY FRIENDS BE MY ENEMIES?

16:09.469 --> 16:12.552
FROM NOW ON, RAMOS,

16:12.638 --> 16:16.472
YOU HAVE NO FRIENDS.

16:16.559 --> 16:20.348
YOU HAVE FOLLOWERS
AND YOU HAVE COMPETITORS.

16:20.438 --> 16:23.726
THAT IS THE BREAKDOWN
OF THE WORLD NOW.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.524
<i>YOU MUST LIVE WITH IT.</i>

16:33.784 --> 16:36.321
HOW DO YOU CLASSIFY
YOURSELF, CRISTO?

16:36.370 --> 16:38.577
MYSELF?

16:38.664 --> 16:41.656
I AM A FOLLOWER, GENERAL.

16:41.751 --> 16:44.038
A FOLLOWER.

16:45.838 --> 16:46.919
FOR HOW LONG?

16:47.006 --> 16:48.963
HOW LONG?

16:49.050 --> 16:51.917
HOVV LONG VVILL YOU BE A FOLLOVVER?
UNTIL MY BACK IS TURNED?

16:52.011 --> 16:54.002

16:54.055 --> 16:56.092

16:56.182 --> 16:59.345
ONLY UNTIL THAT MOMENT,

16:59.393 --> 17:04.058
WHEN YOU PROVE TO ME
THAT YOU CANNOT LEAD.

17:04.147 --> 17:08.311
ONLY UNTIL THAT MOMENT
WHEN I THINK PERHAPS"

17:09.319 --> 17:10.685
PERHAPS WHAT?

17:10.780 --> 17:14.272
PERHAPS I AM
STRONGER THAN YOU.

17:14.367 --> 17:18.986
YOU'LL BE EATEN BY WORMS
BEFORE THAT MOMENT COMES.

17:27.505 --> 17:29.246
WHAT IS IT?

17:38.599 --> 17:40.010
TAKE A DRINK OF WINE.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.768
<i>IT WILL MAKE
YOU FEEL BETTER.</i>

17:43.854 --> 17:45.720
THAT'S RIGHT.

17:45.815 --> 17:48.728
THAT'S RIGHT. HA\/E A GLASS OF VVINE.
I'LL FEEL BETTER.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.608
WELL, GO AHEAD.

17:50.695 --> 17:53.062
HAVE A GLASS OF VVINE. IT
VVILL MAKE YOU SLEEP BETTER.

17:53.155 --> 17:57.399
YES, IT VVOULD MAKE ME SLEEP BETTER,
WOULDN'T IT? FOR HOVV LONG?

17:57.493 --> 18:02.033
FOR HOVV LONG VVILL IT MAKE ME SLEEP?
MAYBE FOR ALL ETERNITY, EH?

18:06.377 --> 18:10.416
YOU ARE DEMENTED.
YOU'VE GONE CRAZY.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.463
<i>WHY DID YOU DO THAT?</i>

18:12.550 --> 18:15.793
BECAUSE I'M CRAZY. AND BECAUSE
I'M ALLERGIC TO POISON.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.844
I ALSO HAVE
A YEN TO LIVE.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.720

18:40.953 --> 18:42.864
WHEN?

18:44.665 --> 18:47.407
ALL RIGHT.
I WILL TELL HIM.

18:52.965 --> 18:56.378
THAT WAS THE GATEHOUSE
OF THE PRISON.

18:56.469 --> 19:00.884
THE GUARDS HAVE SHOT
TABAL AND GARCIA.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.715
THEY ARE BOTH DEAD.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.392
AND WHAT SHALL WE DO
NOW, CRISTO, HUH?

19:06.479 --> 19:09.562
<i>SHALL WE MOURN FOR THEM'? THEY
WERE OUR FRHENDS, WEREWT THEY'?</i>

19:09.649 --> 19:13.813
BUT THEN AGAIN, THEY CAN'T BE CUR FRIENDS
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BE FRIENDS AND ASSASSINS.

19:13.861 --> 19:16.728
THEY CANNOT BE BOTH. THAT VVAS
YOUR POINT, VVASN'T IT, EH?

19:16.822 --> 19:20.861

<i>I HAD NOTHING LIKE THAT/N

LOOK! I'LL SHOW YOU.

19:47.603 --> 19:50.220
IT'S AN ILLUSION, YOU SEE?

19:50.314 --> 19:54.524
IT'S JUST A MIRROR.
AN ORDINARY MIRROR.

19:56.070 --> 19:58.357
BUT IT'S GLASS,
YOU SEE? JUST GLASS!

19:58.406 --> 19:59.612
<i>[gunshot]</i>

20:07.206 --> 20:09.664

YOU'LL BE VERY LONELY.

20:25.057 --> 20:30.177
BUT YOU HAVE JUST KILLED
A BETTER MAN, RAMOS.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.093
GENERAL CLEMENTE.

21:07.349 --> 21:09.477
I AM FATHER TOMAS.

21:13.981 --> 21:16.097
YES?

21:16.192 --> 21:18.684
YOU WILL FORGIVE
ME, GENERAL,

21:18.778 --> 21:21.361
BUT THIS MUST
BE SAID NOW.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.694
WHAT MUST BE SAID?

21:25.785 --> 21:27.947
THE EXECUTIONS.

21:27.995 --> 21:31.454
THEY HAVE BEEN GOING
ON NOW FOR A WEEK.

21:31.499 --> 21:34.332

EXPECT FROM THE NEVV REGIME?

21:39.673 --> 21:42.051
I HAVE ENEMIES, FATHER.
I HAVE ENEMIES.

21:42.134 --> 21:45.217
AND, AS LONG AS I HA\/E ENEMIES,
THE EXECUTIONS VVILL CONTINUE.

21:45.304 --> 21:49.013
THEY'LL CONTINUE 24 HOURS
A DAY, 7 DAYS A WEEK.

21:49.099 --> 21:52.467
AND IF THAT DISTURBS THE PEOPLE,
VVELL, THEN, IF THAT'S-

21:52.520 --> 21:54.306
THEN WHAT?

21:56.649 --> 21:58.811
THEN LET THEM DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

21:58.859 --> 22:02.898
LET THEM GO IN THE CAVES.
LET THEM STARVE FOR A YEAR!

22:02.988 --> 22:06.982
LET THEM RAISE AN ARMY LIKE I DID!
I DON'T CARE VVHAT THEY DO!

22:07.034 --> 22:12.700
GENERAL CLEMENTE, THE VICTORY
IS NOT SO SVVEET, IS IT?

22:12.790 --> 22:15.498
INSTEAD OF THE
FLAVOR OF WINE,

22:39.149 --> 22:42.733
I WANT TO KNOW, WHY DO
I HAVE SO MANY ENEMIES?

22:42.820 --> 22:46.939
IT IS THE STORY OF
ALL TYRANTS, GENERAL.

22:47.032 --> 22:51.447
THEY HAVE BUT
ONE REAL ENEMY,

22:51.537 --> 22:55.326
