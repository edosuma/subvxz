00:09.442 --> 00:14.175
One day,
you'll ask me to speak of the truth,

00:14.280 --> 00:17.443
of the miracle of your birth,

00:17.517 --> 00:20.509
to explain what is unexplained.

00:21.554 --> 00:25.490
And if l falter or fail on this day,

00:25.558 --> 00:28.891
know there is an answer, my child,

00:28.995 --> 00:32.829
a sacred, imperishable truth,

00:32.899 --> 00:36.528
but one you may never hope to find alone.

00:37.837 --> 00:41.238
Chance meeting your perfect other,

00:41.341 --> 00:46.404
your perfect opposite,
your protector and endangerer.

00:49.482 --> 00:55.648
Chance embarking with this other
on the greatest ofjourneys,

00:55.722 --> 00:59.886
a search for truths fugitive and imponderable.

00:59.993 --> 01:04.589
lf one day this chance may befall you,
my son,

01:05.665 --> 01:08.657
do not fail or falter to seize it.

01:09.769 --> 01:12.169
The truths are out there.

01:13.239 --> 01:18.677
And if one day you should
behold a miracle, as l have in you,

01:18.745 --> 01:22.841
you will learn the truth is not found in science

01:22.916 --> 01:25.578
or on some unseen plane,

01:26.719 --> 01:29.847
but by looking into your own heart.

01:31.391 --> 01:34.724
And in that moment you will be blessed

01:36.262 --> 01:38.355
and stricken.

01:39.399 --> 01:43.893
For the truest truths
are what hold us together

01:44.938 --> 01:49.898
or keep us painfully, desperately apart.

- Hey. Tall coffee with milk?
- Thanks. Can l get a warm-up, please?

03:44.390 --> 03:46.881
You have five new messages.

03:58.705 --> 04:04.200
l've resisted contacting you for reasons
l know you continue to appreciate.

04:04.277 --> 04:07.269
But, to be honest, some unexpected
dimensions of my new life

04:07.380 --> 04:10.042
are eating away at any resolve l have left.

04:10.116 --> 04:13.210
l'm lonely, Dana,

04:13.286 --> 04:17.382
uncertain of my ability to live like this.

04:17.457 --> 04:22.895
l want to come home.
To you, and to William.

04:50.223 --> 04:55.251
l am physically shaking right now,
seeing your words.

04:55.328 --> 04:57.956
Wishing it were you speaking them to me.

04:58.064 --> 05:00.897
l want so badly to see you too.

05:02.802 --> 05:05.600
But you are still not safe here.

05:23.256 --> 05:26.953
The child's mother was just here.
Where did she go?

05:27.026 --> 05:29.358
l think that's her out there.

05:39.205 --> 05:41.935
l'm sorry. Sorry.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.843
Could l talk to you a second?

06:21.914 --> 06:26.010
- lt's about Agent Mulder.
- What about Mulder?

06:26.085 --> 06:29.054
A guy contacted us
through lntelligence channels.

06:29.155 --> 06:32.386
He wants to talk to Fox Mulder,
only he won't say why.

06:32.492 --> 06:35.655
- Who is he?
- We don't know. He always covers his tracks.

06:35.728 --> 06:38.697
But this morning we finally
got him to tip his hand.

06:38.765 --> 06:42.531
- He says he has classified military files.
- On what?

06:42.602 --> 06:47.096
These bioengineered soldiers we've all
come in contact with - super-soldiers.

06:47.206 --> 06:51.165
The same ones threatening Mulder's life,
forcing him to live underground.

06:51.244 --> 06:55.943
- What does he want with Mulder?
- To give him the names of the super-soldiers.

06:56.048 --> 06:59.677
And Mulder's the only person
he'll give 'em to.

07:05.124 --> 07:10.118
Even if this was a good idea,
l don't know how to contact him.

07:11.798 --> 07:13.732
l'm sorry about that.

07:13.800 --> 07:18.396
l believe that last class we were covering
petechia and evidence of death by...

07:18.471 --> 07:20.371
Agent Scully.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.283
- What the hell are you doing?
- Trying to teach a class.

07:33.386 --> 07:35.911
Do you understand what we're being offered?

07:35.988 --> 07:38.582
lf we know who they are,
we can go after them.

07:38.658 --> 07:42.560
Somebody is giving us a way that could
make it safe for Mulder to come home.

07:42.628 --> 07:45.961
That's the operative word here: somebody.

07:46.065 --> 07:50.297
- Somebody that we don't know.
- You don't wanna check it out?

07:50.403 --> 07:55.670
What l don't want is Agent Mulder's life
to be endangered any more than it already is.

07:55.775 --> 07:58.335
How long are you gonna do this?

08:00.413 --> 08:04.349
- Do what, Agent Doggett?
- Refuse to trust me.

08:04.450 --> 08:06.247
Or anybody.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.820
How else are you gonna get him home?

08:32.678 --> 08:36.375
- l said get in the car right now.
- Leave us alone!

08:36.482 --> 08:41.181
- l am not telling you again.
- Get away from us!

08:44.957 --> 08:48.552
- She's coming with me.
- What are you doing?

08:48.661 --> 08:51.323
Do you need help, ma'am?

08:51.397 --> 08:53.524
- No.
- Hey!

08:53.633 --> 08:55.692
Don't take her with you.

08:57.136 --> 09:01.129
- Do you need me to call the police?
- Don't go. Don't...

09:01.207 --> 09:04.040
Don't go! Please.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.548
Ma'am, are you all right?

09:24.664 --> 09:28.259
Come on in.
The phone's over there.

09:28.367 --> 09:34.499
l don't know if it's such a good idea
making out a police report.

09:43.616 --> 09:46.676
Well, you've obviously got a problem.

09:48.888 --> 09:51.288
l saw you this morning at the café.

09:53.626 --> 09:55.423
ls he your husband?

09:57.029 --> 10:01.193
- Yeah.
- lt's OK. l understand.

10:03.869 --> 10:08.704
l mean... it's hard enough caring for a child.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.771
You don't have anyone, do you?

10:15.147 --> 10:17.047
No.

10:20.486 --> 10:22.579
But l wish l did.

10:25.257 --> 10:27.817
Maybe he'll come back.

10:33.165 --> 10:35.656
Do you have anywhere to go?

10:39.005 --> 10:40.472
No.

10:41.440 --> 10:46.002
l'm gonna get you a blanket
and something hot to drink.

10:46.112 --> 10:48.171
All right?

10:48.280 --> 10:49.975
Thank you.

10:51.751 --> 10:54.311
- My name's Dana.
- Patty.

11:21.113 --> 11:25.049
- What do you have?
- That source called my cellphone tonight.

11:25.151 --> 11:27.984
- l ran a trace.
- Did you get a number?

11:28.054 --> 11:30.648
No, but l got a node.

11:30.723 --> 11:36.628
Sector of six city blocks.
Area's vacant except for this building.

11:37.663 --> 11:42.965
Say this source is for real
and this is Mulder's chance to come home.

11:43.035 --> 11:46.163
We spook the spook
and maybe that chance goes away.

11:46.238 --> 11:49.366
Or, worse, it drives Mulder deeper.

12:14.333 --> 12:16.597
Where are you going?

12:16.702 --> 12:19.728
- Take a little look into his car.
- l'll say it again.

12:19.839 --> 12:22.501
We risk compromising Mulder's return.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.271
l don't plan on getting caught.

12:43.629 --> 12:45.927
Evening. How are you?

12:47.733 --> 12:51.362
Good. You?

12:54.039 --> 12:55.870
Your wife and kid?

12:59.445 --> 13:01.743
They're good. Good.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.541
Everybody's good.

14:10.883 --> 14:13.181
Monica, wake up.

15:17.182 --> 15:20.174
- Hello?
- You awake?

15:20.252 --> 15:21.947
Yeah.

15:22.054 --> 15:27.754
- l just lay down. What time is it?
- 6am. Reyes and l tailed a car to your street.

15:27.860 --> 15:31.557
A guy went into your building
who we guess you got no business with.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.532
Are you there, Agent Scully?

15:42.374 --> 15:44.569
Put him down. Now.

15:46.412 --> 15:50.371
- Oh, my God.
- Put my baby down.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.973
Agent Scully?

16:24.016 --> 16:26.985
Agent Scully, do you know this man?

16:28.320 --> 16:33.656
l wouldn't think so. Not with him
trying to pick his way into your place.

16:41.967 --> 16:44.765
Start with who you work for.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.998
l'm not at liberty to say.

16:48.140 --> 16:51.041
ls this your wife?

16:51.143 --> 16:55.375
Maybe she's at liberty. Maybe she
doesn't wanna accompany you to prison.

16:55.481 --> 17:00.384
You staged this, didn't you?
Arguing on the street.

17:00.486 --> 17:02.181
- Everything.
- No.

17:02.287 --> 17:06.723
- lt's a con job. What are you after, my baby?
- No, no.

17:08.227 --> 17:12.459
- l want to protect William.
- That's enough. Wanna get us killed?

17:12.531 --> 17:17.867
You said that they could help us.
You told me that. That's what you said.

17:17.970 --> 17:21.166
What the hell's going on here?

17:23.541 --> 17:26.204
They're watching.

17:26.310 --> 17:28.711
They're watching?

17:48.434 --> 17:51.369
You got something to say, say it.

17:54.406 --> 17:59.366
l work for the National Security Agency.
The name on my driver's license is false.

17:59.445 --> 18:04.712
lf you call the police, l'd be held only until
another NSA agent authorized my release.

18:04.783 --> 18:08.446
l don't exist as a citizen,
nor does anyone l work with.

18:08.554 --> 18:13.014
- So what are you doin' here?
- As you can see, my wife is upset.

18:13.092 --> 18:16.721
l was coming to get her
to stop this very event.

18:16.795 --> 18:19.093
What's she so upset about?

18:20.432 --> 18:22.525
We have a daughter.

18:24.136 --> 18:25.797
Joy.

18:28.240 --> 18:32.142
There's something about her.
Something different.

18:33.545 --> 18:37.811
Just like there's something different
with her son William.

18:37.916 --> 18:42.376
Different how? How do you know
anything about her or her son?

18:42.454 --> 18:46.550
l know virtually everything about you.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.252
And you.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.422
And you.

18:52.598 --> 18:58.833
Several months ago, you saw your son affect
the movement of the mobile over his crib.

18:58.937 --> 19:00.996
He spun it as if with his mind.

19:02.508 --> 19:05.238
lt happened to us the same way.

19:06.145 --> 19:11.276
So you've been looking in
this apartment with what, cameras?

19:11.350 --> 19:15.946
- Various forms of technology.
- Then it's you who's been contacting us?

19:16.021 --> 19:21.618
Not directly. My scope is limited.
l only look at what they tell me to.

19:21.693 --> 19:27.996
But l've told my supervisor everything l'm
telling you about my daughter and her son.

19:28.100 --> 19:32.969
He started to look into it. He learned things
about a super-soldier program,

19:33.038 --> 19:35.370
things he won't tell us.

19:35.474 --> 19:39.433
Crimes, he says, against innocent people.

19:40.345 --> 19:43.314
What does he want with Mulder?

19:43.982 --> 19:48.851
Mulder's the only one capable
of making the connections, he says.

19:48.954 --> 19:54.984
Maybe we can help you, and maybe
you can help us find out the truth.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.030
About what our babies really are.

20:22.321 --> 20:26.257
- Hello?
- You've had quite an earful.

20:26.358 --> 20:28.019
Who is this?

20:28.093 --> 20:33.030
As my associate indiscreetly told you,
we don't have names.

20:35.033 --> 20:37.900
You've been listening to us?

20:38.003 --> 20:41.837
lt's all l could do after you closed the shades.

20:41.907 --> 20:46.776
- Agent Scully.
- You ever heard of the Constitution?

20:46.878 --> 20:52.248
Yes. lt's what allows foreign terrorists
to live here and enjoy the American Dream.

20:52.351 --> 20:54.842
Until time comes to destroy it.

20:55.887 --> 21:01.553
My trespasses are the least of your concern,
after what they've done to you and Mulder.

21:01.627 --> 21:06.087
- What have they done?
- lt's what they're prepared to do next.

21:06.198 --> 21:12.899
- l'd be happy to tell Agent Mulder.
- Tell me. l don't know how to reach him.

21:12.971 --> 21:16.065
You reached him yesterday.
You sent him an email.

21:16.141 --> 21:19.440
Would you like me to read it to you?

21:19.544 --> 21:25.107
Why should l trust you?
You're just a voice on the end of the phone.

21:25.217 --> 21:30.780
l'm not gonna give you anything
unless l can meet you, unless l...

21:30.889 --> 21:33.153
unless l can see your face.

21:37.329 --> 21:39.422
Are you still there?

21:41.400 --> 21:45.268
lf you think you can flush me out,
you're making a big mistake.

21:46.138 --> 21:51.508
Bus bench, lnternet café.
Come alone. You have 20 minutes.

22:04.089 --> 22:05.579
Agent Scully.

22:10.028 --> 22:14.089
- What are you doing?
- l'm going to meet your contact.

22:14.166 --> 22:17.431
- l need you to watch William, Monica.
- l don't like this.

22:17.502 --> 22:22.371
l don't like the feel of it, and l don't like
you agreeing to it without backup.

22:22.474 --> 22:25.807
You said l had to trust someone, right?

22:25.877 --> 22:27.868
Well, that's what l'm doing.

22:37.622 --> 22:40.955
- Hello?
- Are you armed, Agent Scully?

22:42.961 --> 22:44.223
Yes.

22:44.329 --> 22:49.460
And you're prepared to use your weapon
should anything go wrong?

22:50.969 --> 22:54.700
- l'm not sure l follow you.
- Then do exactly as l say.

22:56.041 --> 22:59.499
lf you vary my instructions
in the smallest way, we're over.

22:59.578 --> 23:05.244
lf l see or suspect that you're not working
alone, l'll terminate our communication.

23:05.350 --> 23:09.047
lf l believe a third party is using
this meeting to prevent our exchange,

23:09.154 --> 23:13.420
you must be prepared to use your weapon
in your own defense. Am l clear?

23:13.525 --> 23:15.152
Yes.

23:15.227 --> 23:21.029
There's a green sedan across the street
from you. The keys are in it. Get in the car.

23:37.082 --> 23:41.018
- All right, what next?
- Start the engine. Put the car in drive.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.179
Await my next order.

23:49.761 --> 23:51.956
Pull out, quickly. Go now.

23:57.068 --> 24:01.801
- Agent Scully?
- ls it necessary to get innocent people hurt?

24:01.907 --> 24:06.037
You're free to stop the car and
walk away at any time. lt's up to you.

24:06.111 --> 24:11.743
l'm doing this for your own protection.
And for Mulder's.

24:11.817 --> 24:15.651
- So where am l going?
- Turn right, right now.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.552
Stop the car.

24:26.465 --> 24:31.767
Get out, Agent Scully.
Turn the engine off, take the keys out.

24:41.813 --> 24:45.579
Walk to the top of the alley.
There's another car there.

24:45.650 --> 24:50.178
Get in and drive directly to
the lnterstate on-ramp, heading west.

24:50.288 --> 24:55.351
You will continue driving west
until l tell you otherwise.

25:18.950 --> 25:21.009
That's far enough.

25:28.660 --> 25:30.719
Get out of the car.

25:32.831 --> 25:34.890
Leave it running.

25:47.712 --> 25:51.341
- Where are you?
- Move around to the trunk.

25:59.991 --> 26:05.054
You'll see a change of clothes inside for you.
Put them on.

26:08.600 --> 26:15.062
- We're in the middle of nowhere.
- There is no ''middle of nowhere'' anymore.

26:31.122 --> 26:34.523
Put the gun in the trunk.
Your clothes, too.

27:08.159 --> 27:11.060
Your watch. Give it to me.

27:12.097 --> 27:14.759
This is ridiculous.
This has gone far enough.

27:14.833 --> 27:17.597
Do you want to see Mulder again?

27:37.355 --> 27:41.018
These clothes that l'm wearing,
they're my size.

27:41.126 --> 27:43.253
How the hell do you know my size?

27:43.328 --> 27:45.421
Your size?

27:46.665 --> 27:52.626
l know your blood type, your resting
heart rate, your childhood fear of clowns.

27:52.704 --> 27:57.164
l know the name of your college boyfriend,
your true hair color, your ATM PlN number.

27:57.275 --> 28:01.371
Favorite charities, pet peeves.
l know you spend too much time alone.

28:01.479 --> 28:06.712
And l know that on one lonely night,
you invited Mulder to your bed.

28:09.487 --> 28:11.478
Oh, my God.

28:13.324 --> 28:15.451
l was as surprised as you are.

28:20.298 --> 28:22.129
Who authorizes you?

28:23.802 --> 28:26.532
l mean, what gives you the right?

28:26.638 --> 28:30.870
- Who are you?
- l'm the future, Agent Scully.

28:30.975 --> 28:33.671
And l risked my life being here.

28:34.913 --> 28:38.576
Then why do it?
l mean, why meet me?

28:38.683 --> 28:43.143
You can reach Mulder. He needs to know
what l know, or he may have no future.

28:43.221 --> 28:45.086
Perhaps no one will.

28:49.227 --> 28:53.163
Another car is parked on the main road,
half a mile out.

28:53.231 --> 28:56.667
lf l see you haven't contacted
Mulder in 24 hours, l disappear

28:56.735 --> 29:01.502
and you never see me again.
Do you understand, lady?

29:35.473 --> 29:38.567
l'm teaching a class.
ls it something pressing?

29:38.643 --> 29:42.807
Yeah. l'm worried now about
what it is l've gotten you into.

29:42.914 --> 29:44.745
You're right to be worried.

29:44.816 --> 29:50.618
This guy that led you all over town last night
says he wants to talk to Mulder, right?

29:50.722 --> 29:54.988
Why does he need you?
Why not go to Mulder directly?

29:55.093 --> 29:59.427
Cos he knows Mulder resurfaces
only if the one person he trusts asks him to.

29:59.497 --> 30:03.297
That guy didn't come to me, Agent Doggett.
He came to you.

30:03.401 --> 30:06.598
That woman l took in blew his cover.
He had no other choice.

30:06.671 --> 30:10.835
Did you ever stop to think that this woman
and her husband are in on this too?

30:10.942 --> 30:12.910
l don't believe that.

30:12.977 --> 30:16.674
That woman is truly scared for her child,
for the same reasons that l am.

30:16.781 --> 30:21.616
How do you know they're not being used
by this shadow man to lure Mulder out?

30:21.686 --> 30:22.675
To kill him?

30:22.787 --> 30:28.453
Cos that couple doesn't even trust
the shadow man, for their own reasons.

30:28.526 --> 30:32.963
Think about it.
This guy seems to know everything.

30:33.031 --> 30:35.090
He even reads your email.

30:35.166 --> 30:41.696
How can you or anybody hope to ensure
for Mulder a safe passage home?

30:41.806 --> 30:46.800
Mulder and l already considered that
even before he left.

30:46.878 --> 30:49.540
His return's been prearranged.

30:49.647 --> 30:53.549
The place, the mode of transport,
everything's been set.

30:53.651 --> 30:56.484
You can call the whole thing off.

30:56.554 --> 31:00.513
l can't. l've already sent for him.

31:02.160 --> 31:06.221
Mulder's on a train.
He'll be here at midnight.

31:06.331 --> 31:08.697
- You could reach him.
- You can't do that to me.

31:08.800 --> 31:11.860
- l'm sorry.
- l wanna see him so bad.

31:11.970 --> 31:18.000
l know, and l'm wanna make sure you get to,
Dana. That's the whole reason l'm here.

31:18.076 --> 31:20.806
Well, it's too late.

31:23.681 --> 31:25.740
And l have to go.

32:12.297 --> 32:14.265
Agent Boal? Edie Boal?

32:15.967 --> 32:18.765
l'm John Doggett.
We spoke a few minutes ago.

32:18.870 --> 32:22.237
You said if l came right down,
you might be able to help?

32:22.307 --> 32:26.641
- What'd l get myself into?
- l've got some clothing here.

32:26.744 --> 32:29.440
l'm looking for anything
that might give me an lD.

32:29.547 --> 32:31.947
- Male or female?
- A male who handled them.

32:32.050 --> 32:34.575
He gave them to a female agent.

32:34.652 --> 32:36.586
When do you need 'em?

32:36.654 --> 32:39.623
l got a little over an hour.

32:40.391 --> 32:44.384
Your staring over my shoulder
doesn't make me go faster.

33:58.169 --> 34:04.506
Could l have your attention, please?
Southbound 112, now arriving.

34:04.575 --> 34:09.170
Please stay clear of the platform
until the train comes to a full stop.

35:41.472 --> 35:44.236
Two men shot!
Two men shot!

35:44.308 --> 35:46.902
- Keep rolling!
- Stop the train!

35:46.978 --> 35:49.606
- Keep rolling!
- l'm a federal agent!

35:49.680 --> 35:51.443
Keep rolling!

35:54.652 --> 35:56.483
Mulder!

37:20.571 --> 37:22.766
Agent Scully?

37:23.841 --> 37:26.366
This wasn't supposed to happen.

37:26.444 --> 37:29.572
All we wanted was answers.
We never meant to harm you.

37:29.680 --> 37:35.016
- My husband was not a part of this.
- l know he was trying to protect me.

37:35.086 --> 37:40.251
The man who he works for,
he's the one who's responsible for this.

37:40.358 --> 37:43.623
l know, and l'm sorry.

37:46.897 --> 37:48.956
l'm so sorry.

38:13.557 --> 38:16.424
- What is it?
- What l was afraid of.

38:16.494 --> 38:20.555
- Agent Doggett, what?
- We can't find him.

38:21.399 --> 38:23.299
- Who?
- The man l shot.

38:23.401 --> 38:27.599
He fell in front of a frickin' movin' train,
but he ain't down there.

38:27.672 --> 38:29.731
- Well, where is he?
- Nowhere.

38:29.807 --> 38:33.641
lt shouldn't make sense, but l ran
the DNA on the clothes he gave you,

38:33.744 --> 38:35.803
and the man's DNA can't be tested.

38:35.913 --> 38:39.747
They say it's some weird
DNA complex with iron.

38:39.817 --> 38:43.344
- That's doesn't make sense.
- l think it does.

38:43.454 --> 38:46.617
He's not a man.
He's a super-soldier.

38:47.825 --> 38:49.690
Mulder.

38:51.829 --> 38:54.195
l've got to warn Mulder.

38:55.633 --> 39:00.832
Get on the radio and alert them
that there's a situation on that train.

39:00.938 --> 39:04.704
- A situation?
- The man who fell on the tracks got on it.

39:04.809 --> 39:08.643
This is the southbound 112.
We got ajumper.

39:08.713 --> 39:11.841
A man jumped off the train
at the mile 19 connector.

39:11.949 --> 39:14.713
He ran into the Manville rock quarry there.

39:31.836 --> 39:38.503
Agent Scully, you drive. Head down into
the quarry. We'll meet you in the bottom.

39:51.756 --> 39:53.417
Agent Reyes.

39:55.993 --> 39:57.085
Mulder!

39:58.362 --> 40:00.421
Mulder!

40:00.531 --> 40:02.829
Mulder, it's John Doggett!

40:27.958 --> 40:30.051
Mulder?

40:34.565 --> 40:36.624
Mulder!

40:41.939 --> 40:43.600
Mulder?

41:23.914 --> 41:26.144
Stop there!

41:26.250 --> 41:28.946
Stop right there!

41:33.290 --> 41:35.349
Why do want to kill us?

41:35.926 --> 41:39.453
Mulder must die.
Mulder or your son.

41:40.097 --> 41:44.625
What are you talking about?
What does this have to do with my son?

41:46.170 --> 41:49.139
What's wrong with my son?

41:49.206 --> 41:51.504
Answer me!

42:36.253 --> 42:39.552
l hold no hope
you can respond to this.

42:39.657 --> 42:44.720
Or that it reaches you.
l only hope that you are alive.

42:44.828 --> 42:49.925
l cannot help believing that you jumped off
that train because you knew what l now know.

42:50.034 --> 42:57.099
That these ''super-soldiers,'' if that's
what they are, can in fact be destroyed.

42:57.207 --> 43:02.201
That the key to their destruction lies
in the iron compound at that quarry.

43:02.279 --> 43:07.546
l am scared for you, Mulder. And for William.
The forces against us are unrelenting.

43:07.618 --> 43:10.052
But so is my determination.

43:10.120 --> 43:16.025
To see you again, to regain the comfort
and safety we shared for so brief a time.

43:16.093 --> 43:20.757
Until then, l remain forever yours... Dana.
