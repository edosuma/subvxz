01:14.100 --> 01:17.100
Admit it, Peter. You're being schooled by a girl.

01:23.550 --> 01:25.790
Well, well. Looks like school is out.

01:33.000 --> 01:33.700
Hey!

01:35.200 --> 01:36.950
Somebody get me down.

01:39.200 --> 01:43.200
-Why don't you just phase through it?
-And fall in my face? No, thanks.

01:43.500 --> 01:47.300
-Now, come on and help me out.
-You're an X-Man. Do it yourself.

01:47.600 --> 01:48.500
Kurt!

01:50.300 --> 01:51.000
Peter!

01:57.800 --> 01:59.000
This is not so good.

02:04.800 --> 02:07.850
-Hello, Kitty.
-Great. You're a lot of help.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.100
Five more seconds, and I win.

02:19.100 --> 02:21.700
-What just happened?
-He happened.

02:23.650 --> 02:26.100
Just my little way of saying goodbye.

02:26.700 --> 02:28.150
See you when I get back.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.300
Yeah, you better run!

02:30.600 --> 02:33.300
Wait! Come back here and get us down!

02:33.700 --> 02:36.500
Logan! Logan!

02:42.700 --> 02:45.350
Come on, Jean. How many times
do I have to say I'm sorry?

02:45.550 --> 02:48.650
-Logan's the one you should be apologizing to.
-Yeah, I know.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.800
-Hey, Hank. You waiting there long?
-Not really. Just wanted to make sure I didn't miss you.

03:04.400 --> 03:05.500
Have you seen Rogue?

03:05.800 --> 03:11.000
For reasons beyond my comprehension, Rogue just
dosen't enjoy the thought of you leaving.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.700
Go figure.

03:22.800 --> 03:25.000
-Aren't you gonna say goodbye?
-No.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.500
You know I'll be back, Rogue.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Who cares? Maybe I'll just take off, too.

03:32.400 --> 03:35.700
Why would you do that?
This is your home, kid.

03:36.300 --> 03:42.070
No. It's not home. Not when
you're gone. Which is most of the time.

03:43.200 --> 03:47.000
-People here care for you.
-It's not the same! You're more--

03:47.800 --> 03:48.900
Forget it.

03:49.200 --> 03:52.700
-More what?
-Like family, Logan.

03:53.100 --> 03:56.900
And you don't even know that!
Can't you see I'm just like you?

04:13.600 --> 04:14.800
Charles.

04:15.100 --> 04:16.450
Charles.

04:19.700 --> 04:21.100
Jean? What's wrong?

05:29.200 --> 05:33.000
-Erica. Where's Erica?
-She's still inside!

05:39.100 --> 05:40.300
Erica!

05:48.600 --> 05:51.500
-No! It's too dangerous!
-Not for me.

06:25.700 --> 06:27.600
Over here! It's the mutant!

06:28.300 --> 06:30.900
Hey. Hey, the girl's under there.

06:33.900 --> 06:35.200
Come on. Come on, hurry!

06:37.500 --> 06:40.000
-Mommy.
-Erica? Erica!

06:41.200 --> 06:43.100
-You're okay!
-Oh, baby, you're all right!

06:43.300 --> 06:45.000
Hey, look. It's still alive.

06:48.350 --> 06:50.900
We need to move him.
Julian, spread out a blanket.

06:52.300 --> 06:55.000
What's the matter with you people?
Chris, help me!

06:56.000 --> 06:56.700
Sorry.

07:03.900 --> 07:05.200
Take it easy.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.300
You saved my daughter.

07:10.300 --> 07:12.750
Forget him. He's the MRD's problem now.

07:13.050 --> 07:15.150
You turned him in, Carl?
After what he did?

07:15.450 --> 07:17.900
He's got razors in his hands, Randy.

07:18.200 --> 07:21.050
Haven't you been watchin' the news?
The MRD's been looking for this one.

07:23.700 --> 07:25.400
Well, they won't find him here.

07:39.050 --> 07:42.300
Look. His skin. It's already healing.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.750
Please. Please, wake up.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.200
Charles.

08:01.500 --> 08:02.800
Charles.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.600
Jean? What's wrong?

08:24.650 --> 08:25.550
Jean!

08:39.650 --> 08:42.450
It's okay. You're safe.

08:44.100 --> 08:45.100
Sorry.

08:46.300 --> 08:48.500
-Where am I?
-At my house.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.300
Here. I brought you something to drink.

08:51.500 --> 08:54.000
You're getting better really fast, you know.

08:56.150 --> 08:59.000
Daddy says that's good, because
you wouldn't want to go to a hospital.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.700
Your Dad's a smart man.

09:04.100 --> 09:07.900
I better go. I'm not supposed to
be in here bothering you.

09:09.800 --> 09:10.900
Hello?

09:11.400 --> 09:16.100
Mrs. Wyman, I don't see how it's any
of your concern who stays at our house.

09:16.500 --> 09:19.400
I can't believe Carl. He's got
the whole neighbourhood worked up.

09:19.700 --> 09:21.300
I guess we should have expected this.

09:53.600 --> 09:56.000
He's got razors in his hands.

09:56.900 --> 09:59.000
-Where is he?
-Where is who?

09:59.300 --> 10:02.400
Wanna play it that way?
Fine. You're all under arrest.

10:02.700 --> 10:05.600
-On what charge?
-Harboring a fugitive mutant.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.000
You have no right to do this!

10:27.800 --> 10:29.650
Get clear! We'll handle him!

11:11.200 --> 11:12.250
Who wants some?

11:13.600 --> 11:15.000
Code 10! Abort! Abort!

11:15.300 --> 11:16.750
-Go!
-Go!

11:41.800 --> 11:42.700
Hey!

12:05.200 --> 12:07.000
Tell me about the mutant.

12:09.500 --> 12:15.900
-We don't know what you're talking about.
-His name is Wolverine, and he's very dangerous.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.200
He is not.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.700
Yes, he is.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.000
What you're working on, Hank?

13:27.100 --> 13:30.550
Logan! Seriously. Must you always make an enterance?

13:30.900 --> 13:35.400
Yeah. But you've gotta learn to relax, Hank.
Try getting out a little more.

13:35.800 --> 13:39.200
Well, with Charles and Jean, you know--

13:39.700 --> 13:42.400
unaccounted for, I just
can't think of anything else.

13:43.050 --> 13:44.000
Me neither.

13:44.300 --> 13:47.500
Believe me, I've tried.
Learn anything new?

13:48.300 --> 13:55.100
I have confirmed that the explosion was indeed centered
on Charles' position, so he was the likely target.

13:55.500 --> 13:56.700
But what was the cause?

13:57.100 --> 14:01.100
It defies classification!
No evidence of combustion,

14:01.400 --> 14:05.000
chemical reaction, radiation
or electro-magnetism.

14:05.300 --> 14:09.200
That pretty much rules out the MRD.
Probably Magneto, too.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.500
-So who then?
-I don't know. But I'll figure it out.

14:15.100 --> 14:19.200
What about you, Logan? You're not
the type to pop in for no reason.

14:19.500 --> 14:23.600
It's those freaking Mardees.
They're out of control, Hank.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.970
They snatched up a family
just for helping me. 

14:27.300 --> 14:29.900
Really? They're arresting non-mutants now?

14:30.200 --> 14:32.970
I gotta fix this.
And I want you with me.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.200
No, no. I can't.

14:35.900 --> 14:38.250
-Why don't you ask the others?
-What others?

14:38.500 --> 14:40.500
I don't know where anyone is.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.550
Hank, I need your help.

14:45.500 --> 14:50.200
Well, I can't remember the last
time you ever asked for assistance.

15:03.700 --> 15:05.400
What's that thing doing now?

15:05.800 --> 15:10.500
This piece of junk picked up a mutant, but can
never tell if it's two miles away, or two feet.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.300
Hey, bub.

15:18.750 --> 15:22.400
-How you making out, Hank?
-It smells back here.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.700
Well, I don't think prisoners
oughta ride in the front, do you?

15:26.000 --> 15:27.450
Why don't you put your shacles on.

15:38.050 --> 15:41.500
-What kind of mutie you got in there?
-One big, ugly beast.

15:41.800 --> 15:46.000
Now, can we hurry it up? You do not
want this thing bustin' out right here.

15:47.600 --> 15:48.400
Go. Go.

16:11.900 --> 16:14.000
Freeze!

16:17.500 --> 16:19.700
Hands behind your head, freak. Now!

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
Now, see here, gentlemen.
Let's take a deep breath, shall we?

16:23.300 --> 16:27.300
You see, I'm a pacifist by nature,
so those weapons are not just--

16:29.100 --> 16:31.550
Let me guess. The shackles were chaffing, right?

16:32.100 --> 16:35.800
No. Well, yes, but only during my performance.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.200
I was just about to put them back on. Really.

16:38.600 --> 16:43.800
Let's go, Chewy. You find out where they keep
the prisoners, I'll lock up these guards.

16:44.150 --> 16:46.000
Stop! Where are you taking him?

17:03.700 --> 17:05.700
So, what now? You're gonna torture me?

17:06.000 --> 17:10.700
Think of it as... incentive to
tell me the truth about Wolverine.

17:11.150 --> 17:12.900
I'll tell you the truth. He's a hero.

17:17.700 --> 17:23.200
This is a sensory assault helmet.
The cutting edge in information gathering.

17:23.599 --> 17:24.550
Last chance.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.300
You're the ones people should
watch out for, not the mutants.

17:40.600 --> 17:43.400
Easy now. We don't need to fight, okay?

17:57.700 --> 18:00.000
Gentlemen, there are two ways we can handle this.

18:04.700 --> 18:06.950
What? It was their choice.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.000
I didn't say a word.

18:10.100 --> 18:12.300
Here. I've located the detention area.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.700
-Randy! What did they do to you?
-Are you all right, Daddy?

18:20.100 --> 18:21.150
I'm... I'm okay.

18:21.400 --> 18:24.850
You are animals. We told
you we don't know anything!

18:25.300 --> 18:28.500
Perhaps not. But she might.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
How about you? Easy way, or hard way?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.150
Hard way it is.

18:53.700 --> 18:57.700
Now, I want you to leave
that nice family alone. Got it?

18:58.700 --> 19:02.000
And so you don't forget,
here's a little... incentive.

19:04.100 --> 19:06.000
Wolverine!

19:16.000 --> 19:17.500
-About time.
-Let's go, no?

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Go, go!

19:38.100 --> 19:41.100
-Can anyone here torch a hanger?
-You're singin' my song, mate!

19:41.400 --> 19:44.200
-Boom Boom, light 'em up.
-Sure thing, hotshot.

20:03.900 --> 20:07.200
We got two in pursuit. And fire
balls aren't bringing these down.

20:07.400 --> 20:10.000
-Come on, Dust.
-This one's yours.

20:21.100 --> 20:22.450
Bail out! We're going down!

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
Give it a few weeks.
The Mardees will loose interest in you.

20:54.300 --> 20:56.550
Thank you. For everything.

20:57.300 --> 21:00.100
Well, take care of yourselves.

21:03.600 --> 21:04.900
Don't leave.

21:06.300 --> 21:09.000
I have to. It's time I went home.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.600
Look after your folks, okay?

21:32.300 --> 21:33.300
Hank?

21:35.400 --> 21:39.000
... prompting other nations to consider
forming their own Mutant Response Divisions,

21:39.300 --> 21:41.800
originally proposed by
Senator Kelly of New York.

21:44.700 --> 21:48.100
Hank! Man, say somethin'
when you sneak up on a guy.

21:48.300 --> 21:49.800
I'll try and remember that.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
What are you doing?
Where are the other mutants?

21:53.400 --> 21:55.400
Gone their seperate ways.

21:55.800 --> 22:00.700
But those cells we emptied, they'll be
full again tomorrow... and the next day.

22:01.050 --> 22:02.000
Yeah.

22:02.400 --> 22:04.000
Hank, we both know what's going on.

22:04.600 --> 22:07.200
There's a war coming.
And it ain't gonna be pretty.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.970
I agree. So, what's next?

22:11.000 --> 22:13.300
We bring back the X-Men.

22:15.550 --> 22:18.700
