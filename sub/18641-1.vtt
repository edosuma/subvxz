siren wailing]

02:01.889 --> 02:04.556
[muffled dance music plays]

02:16.704 --> 02:18.170
Shit.

[Light buzzing]

02:26.213 --> 02:27.746

let's go.

02:33.354 --> 02:36.555
[Laughter, indistinct chatter]

03:07.655 --> 03:09.721
Hey! Hey-hey-hey!

03:09.723 --> 03:12.457
[Laughing]

03:15.930 --> 03:18.263
Are you trying it on with me?

03:18.265 --> 03:20.732
- Me?
- Yeah.

03:20.734 --> 03:21.934
- Yeah.
- Are you?

03:21.936 --> 03:23.435
- Always.
- Good.

[vomits]

03:48.729 --> 03:50.762
[man chuckles]

03:52.666 --> 03:53.732
Fancy a kebab?

03:53.734 --> 03:56.468
[Woman coughing]

03:57.738 --> 03:59.905
Maybe you should pace yourself
next time.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.274
Oh, shut up.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.510
Oh...

04:07.314 --> 04:08.747
[softly] I'm pregnant.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.315
What?

04:16.690 --> 04:18.257
I'm pregnant.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.699
[Man laughing hysterically]

04:29.637 --> 04:31.670
You serious?

04:31.672 --> 04:33.739
[Laughing]

04:33.741 --> 04:35.807
That's...

04:35.809 --> 04:38.010
That is...

04:38.012 --> 04:39.911
brilliant.

04:43.751 --> 04:47.352
I mean... we're gonna--
we're gonna keep it, right?

04:52.926 --> 04:55.727
Is it... is it us?

04:55.729 --> 04:57.963
Charlie, it's a little us.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.502
All right?

05:09.743 --> 05:11.743
A little us.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.324
[Charlie shrieking, giggling]

05:25.326 --> 05:27.759
- [Charlie] Wait, wait.
- Hm-mm.

05:27.761 --> 05:28.860
Baby...

05:28.862 --> 05:30.662
Who the fuck cares?

05:40.507 --> 05:42.374
[Man chuckles]

05:47.948 --> 05:50.649
[giggling, laughter]

05:50.651 --> 05:52.451
Come get me!

05:56.857 --> 05:59.458
You gonna be sick again?

06:01.528 --> 06:03.562
One sec.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.965
Ohhh!

06:06.967 --> 06:09.801
[Chuckles] Fuck!

06:09.803 --> 06:11.770
J-James!

06:11.772 --> 06:13.705
[James] Not again!

06:13.707 --> 06:15.374
[Chuckles]

06:51.545 --> 06:54.980
- [scratching sound]
- [Charlie] Ohhh...

06:54.982 --> 06:57.015
[door creaks, slams]

07:02.089 --> 07:05.424
[babies crying in distance]

07:07.528 --> 07:09.127
[baby fussing]

07:15.769 --> 07:18.470
All right, listen...

07:20.641 --> 07:21.807
Nirvana.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.778
It means idyllic state.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.781
Uh-uh. Try again.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.517
Uh...

07:32.519 --> 07:33.985
Poppy!

07:33.987 --> 07:36.822
Determined for her to be
a smack addict, James?

07:38.792 --> 07:39.891
[Charlie] Thea?

07:41.762 --> 07:43.061
It means goddess.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.932
We can't actually just call her
Goddess, can we?

07:46.934 --> 07:48.834
That would make her arrogant.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.140
Thea.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.048
I actually quite like that.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.486
Can I have a go?

08:21.134 --> 08:23.068
I called your dad.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.841
- When?
- A few days ago.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.776
- Why?
- I don't know.

08:31.778 --> 08:34.779
I thought it might be good
for him to meet Thea.

08:34.780 --> 08:37.249
He's not coming
anywhere near her, Charlie.

08:37.251 --> 08:39.751
- James!
- Charlie.

08:41.621 --> 08:44.656
He'll try and use her
in a ritual or something.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.858
[Baby crying]

09:21.128 --> 09:22.928
Proud father?

09:22.930 --> 09:24.896
Yeah.

09:24.898 --> 09:28.166
Just starting to sink in.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.338
Her name?

09:33.340 --> 09:35.807
Thea?

09:35.809 --> 09:37.576
[Woman] Lovely.

09:39.613 --> 09:42.647
A whole lifetime ahead of her.

09:45.953 --> 09:50.088
And a whole afterlife
after that.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.128
Good luck.

10:03.770 --> 10:07.305
[Baby crying]

10:20.921 --> 10:23.622
[crying continues]

10:54.721 --> 10:56.755
[kettle boiling]

11:00.127 --> 11:03.395
[train wheels clacking]

11:15.175 --> 11:17.709
Back in a few hours, promise.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.378
Gonna be all right?

11:20.380 --> 11:23.748
Yeah. I may want to hang out
without you, anyway.

11:23.750 --> 11:24.849
[James] Hmm.

11:29.423 --> 11:31.856
Maybe you two should go
for a walk, eh?

11:31.858 --> 11:34.325
You haven't left the house
in days.

11:36.763 --> 11:37.862
See ya.

11:39.032 --> 11:42.167
[Door opens, closes]

13:12.259 --> 13:14.893
[swings creaking]

13:48.562 --> 13:50.862
[train wheels clacking]

13:50.864 --> 13:52.997
Hi, yeah, um...

13:52.999 --> 13:54.899
I thought you said a few hours.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.237
Can, uh...

13:59.239 --> 14:01.306
Can you just call me
when you get this, yeah?

14:22.495 --> 14:24.996
[Baby crying]

14:30.237 --> 14:34.005
It's OK, Thea. I'm sorry.

14:34.007 --> 14:37.041
[Thea fussing]

14:37.043 --> 14:39.510
- I'm sorry.
- [Crying stops]

14:39.512 --> 14:41.946
[children shouting]

14:47.420 --> 14:49.387
[sighs]

15:06.106 --> 15:08.072
[door opens, closes]

15:08.074 --> 15:09.540
[James] All right?

15:10.677 --> 15:12.210
Yeah, it's just...

15:12.212 --> 15:14.913
[bowl shatters, water spills]

15:16.149 --> 15:18.383
For fuck's sake!

15:23.390 --> 15:26.658
Sorry, must have
not put it down.

15:26.660 --> 15:31.062
[Baby shrieking]

15:36.703 --> 15:41.039
[baby wailing]

15:47.681 --> 15:50.248
[telephone ringing]

15:50.250 --> 15:53.318
[woman] How was she during
her immunization?

15:53.320 --> 15:56.621
Important to protect her against
all nasty bugs out there.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.356
Barely made a sound.

16:03.663 --> 16:06.431
[Woman] You getting enough time
to eat properly?

16:06.433 --> 16:08.099
Enough sleep?

16:10.537 --> 16:12.670
How are you getting on
with feeding?

16:12.672 --> 16:14.439
Fine, yeah, she's been great.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.975
Yeah, and you are breast
or bottle feeding?

16:16.977 --> 16:18.676
Uh, bottle.

16:18.678 --> 16:21.579
[Woman typing]

16:21.581 --> 16:24.148
Honestly, it doesn't matter
what method you choose,

16:24.150 --> 16:26.584
as long as you're happy
with the decision.

16:31.324 --> 16:34.092
Bonding well with baby?
Spending time together?

16:34.094 --> 16:36.561
Yeah, loads.

16:36.563 --> 16:39.097
Are you getting
much support at home?

16:39.099 --> 16:41.232
Your partner, parents?

16:41.234 --> 16:44.168
Oh, I don't know our parents.
But I can manage.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.771
- You're allowed to ask for help.
- Oh, yeah, I know, I know.

16:46.773 --> 16:49.173
But I like it, being a mum.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.376
My boyfriend's a big kid,

16:51.378 --> 16:53.778
so it's just like having
another one, isn't it?

16:57.717 --> 17:00.051
[Woman typing]

17:07.193 --> 17:09.093
Are you OK?

17:09.095 --> 17:12.530
Oh, yeah, yeah, I just got
these bruises on my back.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.566
- May I see?
- Uh, yeah.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.443
[Charlie] They started
after she was born.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.612
Seem to get a new one every day.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.548
Do you have animals at home?

17:30.550 --> 17:32.050
[Charlie] No.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.152
[Woman] Do you feel dizzy,
faint?

17:34.154 --> 17:37.155
Uh, no, it's just, I...

17:38.258 --> 17:40.091
like I'm losing my brain a bit.

17:40.093 --> 17:41.726
Put her down and...

17:55.708 --> 17:57.508
OK.

17:57.510 --> 18:00.711
Keep an eye on things
and let me know if it continues.

18:00.713 --> 18:04.082
If you don't mind, I'd like you
to have a few blood tests.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.183
Yeah, sure.

18:09.322 --> 18:11.722
[R&B on headset]

18:12.826 --> 18:16.327
[baby crying]

18:28.274 --> 18:30.341
[crying continues]

18:43.223 --> 18:46.791
For fuck's sake,
would you shut the fuck up?!

18:46.793 --> 18:49.227
[Crying stops]

18:50.763 --> 18:52.730
[door bangs]

19:14.287 --> 19:15.586
Ohh!

19:18.758 --> 19:20.725
[Creature snarling]

19:22.595 --> 19:26.464
[skittering noises,
Charlie gasping]

19:28.401 --> 19:32.236
[skittering]

19:46.920 --> 19:48.753
[door creaking]

19:48.755 --> 19:50.621
[click]

19:53.526 --> 19:56.227
- [key turning in lock]
- [James] Home.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.350
Maybe they can do something.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.852
I don't want to talk
to the fucking police, James.

20:30.597 --> 20:33.397
Baby, there was something
in the flat, OK?

20:33.399 --> 20:34.966
And...

20:34.968 --> 20:36.601
it hated me.

20:36.603 --> 20:37.935
All right, what sort of thing?

20:37.937 --> 20:40.738
I don't know!

20:40.740 --> 20:42.240
You...

20:51.884 --> 20:53.884
Could it be...

20:53.886 --> 20:55.786
postnatal depression?

20:55.788 --> 20:59.724
Oh, yeah, OK, I strangled myself
as a cry for help, OK, yeah.

20:59.726 --> 21:01.392
Nice.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.836
We'll start looking
for somewhere else to live, OK?

21:15.341 --> 21:17.708
How long will that take?

21:17.710 --> 21:18.909
Don't know.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.511
Call your dad.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.850
He's full of shit. Charlie --

21:25.852 --> 21:27.718
Please.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.987
Please, just ask him.

21:29.989 --> 21:32.023
I don't know what to do.

21:34.994 --> 21:38.529
Please, fucking ask him.
I don't know what to do.

21:41.734 --> 21:42.900
OK.

21:55.081 --> 21:57.748
[Man] It's nice to see you.

21:57.750 --> 22:01.018
Looking good.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.820
He's taking good care of you?

22:02.822 --> 22:05.056
Get to the point,
please, Charlie.

22:10.029 --> 22:13.631
Something attacked me
in our house.

22:13.633 --> 22:16.534
- Sorry to hear that.
- [James] Are you?

22:17.837 --> 22:20.371
You live for this stuff.

22:20.373 --> 22:22.873
Like all that shit you used to
bang on about when I was a kid,

22:22.875 --> 22:24.575
drawing weird stuff
on the walls--

22:24.577 --> 22:27.011
I'm an occultist, James,
I'm not a crazy man.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.946
Anything else?

22:28.948 --> 22:34.518
Well, I've got these bruises
all over my back, as well.

22:34.520 --> 22:39.657
We, as a family, have dealt with
situations like this before.

22:39.659 --> 22:42.727
"We" haven't, 'cause I've never
seen anything, have I?

22:42.729 --> 22:44.362
Because I protected you.

22:45.898 --> 22:48.666
The house will need
depopulating.

22:48.668 --> 22:50.868
Depopulating?

22:50.870 --> 22:54.672
I'll need to clean whatever
it is that attacked you.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.374
And then...

22:56.376 --> 23:00.978
create a barrier
to stop it happening again.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.588
Noisy lot, are you?

23:58.438 --> 24:00.638
I need a bag or a box.

24:25.731 --> 24:27.565
I miss her.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.233
Your wife?

24:29.235 --> 24:30.534
Hmm.

24:32.772 --> 24:34.772
I saw her, you know.

24:34.774 --> 24:36.740
After she passed.

24:38.478 --> 24:40.978
- What happened?
- Don't.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.481
Charlie, seriously.

24:46.652 --> 24:47.818
[Clattering]

24:47.820 --> 24:49.787
What the fuck are you doing?

24:49.789 --> 24:51.522
Vessels.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.059
Anything with features.

24:55.061 --> 24:59.230
Eyes, teeth, a face.

25:01.567 --> 25:04.702
They're a window
into our world...

25:04.704 --> 25:08.806
and incredibly dangerous
around children like Thea.

25:08.808 --> 25:10.975
Like Thea?

25:13.779 --> 25:15.045
Yes.

25:18.784 --> 25:20.918
This is because of her.

25:26.125 --> 25:29.593
Her light shines
beyond our world into the--

25:29.595 --> 25:31.529
- Will you stop talking bollocks?
- James!

25:31.531 --> 25:34.098
Can you just shut up
for a second, please!

25:36.903 --> 25:38.869
Put simply...

25:38.871 --> 25:42.840
Thea is a magnet
for the supernatural.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.983
As the house is your main place
of habitation,

25:52.985 --> 25:55.553
it will have to be closed off.

26:03.229 --> 26:06.230
You need to start
listening to me

26:06.232 --> 26:08.899
if you want to stop this
happening again.

26:44.270 --> 26:47.071
[Unintelligible whispering]

26:54.814 --> 26:56.714
Redo this every week.

26:57.817 --> 27:01.318
Fresh salt every day.

27:01.320 --> 27:04.288
Form a barrier.
Same with the windows.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.892
There's one more thing
we need to do.

27:29.715 --> 27:32.349
From about a foot above her,

27:32.351 --> 27:36.820
drip the candle wax
in four points around her body.

27:36.822 --> 27:39.790
As close as you can to her.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.959
The closer the droplets...

27:41.961 --> 27:44.695
the stronger the bond.

27:44.697 --> 27:47.798
You want us to drip boiling hot
wax next to our baby?

53:10.721 --> 53:16.192
If I do, I can't have
my methods questioned.

53:47.558 --> 53:48.724
She OK?

53:48.726 --> 53:50.826
Tired.

53:50.828 --> 53:52.962
Tell me about it.

53:58.002 --> 53:59.868
I've been thinking...

54:02.306 --> 54:04.873
maybe we should invite my dad
over for dinner.

54:07.411 --> 54:09.812
I thought I'd make
a bit more of an effort.

54:12.450 --> 54:13.949
Sure.

54:17.288 --> 54:20.256
Maybe he could baby-sit,
give us a night off.

54:21.726 --> 54:24.393
Booze, bars, girls.

54:37.842 --> 54:39.475
[Charlie] Ready?

54:42.313 --> 54:44.013
All right, come on.

54:49.387 --> 54:51.487
Don't you look lovely?

54:51.489 --> 54:53.656
[Chuckles] School uniform.

54:53.658 --> 54:55.758
She normally likes
to be covered in mud.

54:57.795 --> 55:01.363
Go on, come on.
You know she's gonna help you.

55:01.365 --> 55:02.965
Do you need my help?

55:02.967 --> 55:04.767
Yes.

55:04.769 --> 55:06.635
Why?

55:06.637 --> 55:10.039
Because I don't want mummy
and daddy to be scared anymore.

55:12.476 --> 55:14.476
[Charlie] Go on, then. Go on.

55:17.515 --> 55:19.348
You'll be fine.

55:19.350 --> 55:21.917
And I'm gonna come pick you up
in no time, aren't I?

55:21.919 --> 55:24.586
Because I promised, didn't I?
Yeah?

55:24.588 --> 55:27.856
Then you're happy, you're fine?
Smile.

55:27.858 --> 55:31.427
Thea. Go on. Go on, go on.

56:06.764 --> 56:10.966
Your mother's very excited that
we're spending time together.

56:12.803 --> 56:15.771
My mummy wasn't very nice to me.

56:15.773 --> 56:18.107
Why not?

56:18.109 --> 56:19.808
She was scared of me.

56:21.412 --> 56:23.445
Come and sit down, Thea.

56:27.151 --> 56:28.484
Come on.

56:31.856 --> 56:34.022
Why are you helping me?

56:35.593 --> 56:39.428
If I was sick,
would you look after me?

56:39.430 --> 56:40.829
Yes.

56:40.831 --> 56:42.765
[Elizabeth] Why?

56:42.767 --> 56:45.134
It's nice to help people.

56:45.136 --> 56:47.069
[Elizabeth chuckles]

56:55.946 --> 56:58.981
[Elizabeth] Drink it.
It's not hot.

57:10.795 --> 57:12.861
Finish it.

57:18.102 --> 57:20.702
It's a very special tea.

57:20.704 --> 57:23.605
I drink it to help me see...

57:23.607 --> 57:27.476
the world for what it really is.

57:29.780 --> 57:31.947
People like you and I...

57:31.949 --> 57:34.750
[echoing]
we can see things

57:34.752 --> 57:37.786
no one else can see.

57:40.691 --> 57:43.158
Don't fight it!

57:46.130 --> 57:48.096
Don't fight it!

57:52.536 --> 57:54.102
[High-pitched ringing]

57:54.104 --> 57:55.637
[Charlie] Thea?

57:55.639 --> 57:58.173
Come along, Thea.

57:58.175 --> 57:59.775
[Ringing stops]

58:06.784 --> 58:09.151
[soft skittering, snarling]

58:21.732 --> 58:23.131
[squelching sounds]

58:28.906 --> 58:30.839
This is a hazel tree.

58:30.841 --> 58:33.041
Go and break me off a branch.

58:33.043 --> 58:35.777
[Whispered incantations echoing]

58:45.589 --> 58:46.989
[incantations cease]

58:46.991 --> 58:49.958
[Elizabeth] Nice and deep
into the mud...

58:49.960 --> 58:54.096
draw a large circle round us.

58:56.233 --> 58:58.634
[Thea] What is it?

58:59.870 --> 59:02.237
Protection.

59:05.276 --> 59:10.012
Don't ever leave the circle
until it's safe.

59:28.799 --> 59:30.799
[Thea shrieks]

59:30.801 --> 59:32.834
[skittering noises]

59:36.173 --> 59:39.141
[rustling grows louder]

59:59.730 --> 01:00:02.197
[fire crackling]

01:00:10.808 --> 01:00:14.009
[Elizabeth] I know what
attacked you in your home.

01:00:15.813 --> 01:00:18.981
Your daughter is being hunted

01:00:18.983 --> 01:00:21.617
by a parasite.

01:00:24.054 --> 01:00:27.122
It wants to feed off her.

01:00:29.693 --> 01:00:31.660
I can protect her.

01:00:33.864 --> 01:00:38.166
But I will need to see her
every day.

01:00:45.909 --> 01:00:47.976
[Door shuts]

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.760
[starts engine]

01:01:17.241 --> 01:01:20.776
[radio dial spinning]

01:01:20.778 --> 01:01:23.812
[tuning]

01:01:23.814 --> 01:01:27.149
[static]

01:01:38.896 --> 01:01:40.696
[static continues]

01:02:35.452 --> 01:02:37.219
[Thea giggles]

01:02:37.221 --> 01:02:38.854
What's so funny?

01:02:38.856 --> 01:02:40.989
It's a secret, Mummy.

01:02:56.073 --> 01:02:58.039
So many people can't accept

01:02:58.041 --> 01:03:00.776
the vastness
of the world around them.

01:03:00.778 --> 01:03:03.879
Desperate for
their own dull reality.

01:03:03.881 --> 01:03:06.915
So they hide away from it,

01:03:06.917 --> 01:03:09.951
usually having to take
their own lives.

01:03:11.388 --> 01:03:13.488
Do you know what suicide is?

01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:15.557
No.

01:03:15.559 --> 01:03:17.859
Good.

01:03:17.861 --> 01:03:20.061
It's not an option for us.

01:03:20.063 --> 01:03:23.865
People usually just end up
somewhere far worse.

01:03:25.869 --> 01:03:29.838
People like you and I, Thea,

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.573
must confront our realities.

01:03:33.277 --> 01:03:36.111
Your parents will try to pretend
they understand,

01:03:36.113 --> 01:03:39.047
but they never will.

01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:41.850
The more you tell them
about what you see,

01:03:41.852 --> 01:03:45.453
the more inclined they'll be
to... throw you away.

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:52.093
Took me a long time
to learn all this.

01:03:54.364 --> 01:03:56.431
I had no one to teach me.

01:03:59.303 --> 01:04:01.870
Can you see the door, Thea?

01:04:04.942 --> 01:04:07.175
What's behind it?

01:04:08.579 --> 01:04:10.478
It's dark.

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:16.885
The entity from the woods
yesterday.

01:04:16.887 --> 01:04:19.187
Can you find it?

01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:26.061
Can you feel it?

01:04:28.465 --> 01:04:30.198
No.

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:34.936
[Elizabeth]
When you're given a toy,

01:04:34.938 --> 01:04:38.440
it becomes
your responsibility.

01:04:38.442 --> 01:04:43.345
If the toy breaks,
it's your fault.

01:04:43.347 --> 01:04:50.385
So, if you accidentally
let something through the door,

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:54.556
and mummy and daddy get hurt...

01:04:56.193 --> 01:04:58.159
whose fault is it?

01:04:58.161 --> 01:04:59.661
Mine.

01:04:59.663 --> 01:05:01.496
[Elizabeth] Yes.

01:05:01.498 --> 01:05:06.668
So, if something comes
through...

01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:09.137
you have to deal with it.

01:05:10.941 --> 01:05:14.542
Never call mummy and daddy
for help

01:05:14.544 --> 01:05:16.578
or they may get hurt.

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:18.546
Understand?

01:05:20.117 --> 01:05:22.584
[Distant sirens wailing]

01:05:28.659 --> 01:05:30.926
[R&B playing in background]

01:05:30.928 --> 01:05:33.528
[Alistair] So,
where's the new site?

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:35.664
[James] The arse end
of South London,

01:05:35.666 --> 01:05:40.335
but it's an... "up-and-coming"
area, apparently.

01:05:40.337 --> 01:05:42.270
Which means all the smackheads
have been replaced

01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:43.672
by artisan bakers.

01:05:43.674 --> 01:05:45.440
[Alistair] Mm-hmm.

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:53.615
Can I have some?

01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:56.484
Yes, in about 15 years.

01:05:56.486 --> 01:05:58.653
- [Thea giggles]
- What's wrong with you?

01:05:58.655 --> 01:06:03.391
[Static on radio]

01:06:03.393 --> 01:06:06.394
[static growing louder]

01:06:10.167 --> 01:06:12.500
[skittering noises]

01:06:28.118 --> 01:06:30.185
[Thea] Zaqueo before me...

01:06:30.187 --> 01:06:31.519
[Alistair] Thea.

01:06:31.521 --> 01:06:34.289
Move away from it.

01:06:34.291 --> 01:06:39.294
[Thea whispering incantation,
skittering noises continue]

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:53.675
[Thea] Zaqueo before me,
Zaqueo behind me...

01:06:53.677 --> 01:06:55.410
Zaqueo to my right.

01:06:55.412 --> 01:06:57.379
[Mute snarling]

01:06:57.381 --> 01:07:00.315

[noises grow louder]

01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:06.254
- [noises stop]
- [Thea] I am safe.

01:07:21.505 --> 01:07:23.238
[Children shouting]

01:07:35.318 --> 01:07:37.519
Mummy, look what I did.

01:07:37.521 --> 01:07:40.488
All right. Hang on.

01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:42.123
Ohh!

01:07:42.125 --> 01:07:44.459
What did you draw?

01:08:08.151 --> 01:08:12.420
[Alistair] I saw it
right behind her.

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:14.789
What is it?

01:08:14.791 --> 01:08:16.323
I don't know.

01:08:16.326 --> 01:08:18.093
[Alistair] You don't know?

01:08:18.095 --> 01:08:20.295
And you've got her trying
to fight it?

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:22.330
[Elizabeth] What would you
rather I did?

01:08:22.332 --> 01:08:24.265
It's what her parents wanted.

01:08:24.267 --> 01:08:26.835
Her to be in control.

01:08:26.837 --> 01:08:28.703
She can't handle something
like that.

01:08:28.705 --> 01:08:31.339
I couldn't even begin
to tell them what to do.

01:08:31.341 --> 01:08:34.475
Which is why they came to me.

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:38.813
I'm no expert.

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:41.316
But I did what I had to do.

01:08:41.318 --> 01:08:43.718
To protect my family.

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:47.388
I'm fixing your errors.

01:08:50.727 --> 01:08:55.697
You told me that your son
was going to have a child

01:08:55.698 --> 01:08:59.801
and that, like you,
it might be a beacon.

01:08:59.803 --> 01:09:01.769
I went...

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:04.171
I saw...

01:09:04.174 --> 01:09:07.675
and I told you I needed
to help those people

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:10.778
as soon as possible,
and what did you say?

01:09:10.779 --> 01:09:12.212
That's not what I meant!

01:09:12.215 --> 01:09:15.617
What did you say, Alistair?

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:22.390
You told me your son needed
to see it all for himself.

01:09:22.392 --> 01:09:26.227
And in those six years,

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:28.429
when I might have helped,

01:09:29.733 --> 01:09:34.769
she let through something
so demonic

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:38.573
that even I don't think
I can save her.

01:09:44.714 --> 01:09:47.348
Make amends.

01:09:55.825 --> 01:10:00.528
[Telephone ringing]

01:10:05.368 --> 01:10:07.302
Dad?

01:10:07.304 --> 01:10:10.271
[Alistair] Every mark on my body
was done to save you.

01:10:10.273 --> 01:10:12.607
I was protecting you.

01:10:12.609 --> 01:10:14.742
I've always been trying
to protect you.

01:10:16.746 --> 01:10:18.546
Are you drunk?

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:21.549
I just wanted to be part
of your life again.

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:26.254
Sacrifice, that's what being
a parent is all about.

01:10:26.256 --> 01:10:29.824
It needs a host.
Maybe it will have me.

01:10:29.826 --> 01:10:31.793
Listen, what's going on?

01:10:31.795 --> 01:10:33.995
[Click]

01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:37.398
What happened?

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:38.900
Uh...

[skittering noises]

01:11:55.879 --> 01:11:58.079
[Thea, whispering]
I can make it go away.

01:11:58.081 --> 01:12:02.717
I can make it go away.
I can make it go away...

01:12:02.719 --> 01:12:06.020
I can make it go away.
I can make it go away.

01:12:06.022 --> 01:12:09.757
I can make it go away.

01:12:09.759 --> 01:12:11.759
It's my responsibility.

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:16.497
[Door creaking]

Uggh! Aaaah!

Thea.

01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:46.881
Go upstairs and explore.

01:14:55.625 --> 01:14:56.991
What's going on?

01:14:58.828 --> 01:15:02.063
I want my life back!

01:15:05.802 --> 01:15:08.970
Just take her away.

01:15:08.972 --> 01:15:13.107
You have no idea
what her life is like.

01:15:14.777 --> 01:15:17.211
No idea what she sees.

01:15:17.213 --> 01:15:20.581
Well, then show me.
Show me what she sees.

01:15:20.583 --> 01:15:22.817
Show me all
of the invisible shit

01:15:22.819 --> 01:15:25.620
that has taken away
six years of my life!

01:15:25.622 --> 01:15:28.523
[Fire crackling]

01:15:44.807 --> 01:15:46.307
What do I do?

01:15:46.309 --> 01:15:47.942
[Elizabeth] You drink it.

01:15:53.616 --> 01:15:57.184
Are you sure
you want to do this?

01:16:07.597 --> 01:16:10.865
It wasn't created
for flavor, I'm afraid.

01:16:14.771 --> 01:16:17.071
[Clock ticking]

01:16:21.811 --> 01:16:23.210
[Thea] Daddy?

01:16:23.212 --> 01:16:25.246
[James, faintly] Thea.

01:16:25.248 --> 01:16:28.115
[Static]

01:16:30.019 --> 01:16:31.819
[electricity sparking]

01:16:48.204 --> 01:16:50.171
Now, this will be hard.

01:16:51.808 --> 01:16:54.809
But no matter what you see,

01:16:54.811 --> 01:16:58.312
don't show fear or anger.

01:17:00.650 --> 01:17:01.983
[Sparking, static]

01:17:01.985 --> 01:17:03.985
[guttural snarling]

01:17:08.658 --> 01:17:10.825
[muted squealing]

01:17:10.827 --> 01:17:12.827
[skittering noises]

01:17:12.829 --> 01:17:14.829
[muffled roaring]

01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:29.844
[Elizabeth] No strong emotions.

01:17:29.846 --> 01:17:34.415
Otherwise, the entities that you
want to remain hidden from

01:17:34.417 --> 01:17:36.817
will see you, too.

01:17:55.705 --> 01:17:58.239
[Muffled screeching]

01:17:58.241 --> 01:18:01.375
[James groaning,
creature roaring]

01:18:03.446 --> 01:18:05.746
[roaring stops]

01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:22.730
Granddad.

01:18:27.837 --> 01:18:29.737
Banana!

01:18:34.844 --> 01:18:36.243
Banana, Mummy.

01:18:36.245 --> 01:18:38.379
Oh.

01:18:38.381 --> 01:18:41.982
Toilet guide.
Someone's had an accident.

01:18:44.487 --> 01:18:45.720
[Thea] Mummy!

01:18:45.722 --> 01:18:47.855
[Charlie gasping]

01:18:48.825 --> 01:18:50.458
Ugh!

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:55.296
She doesn't want to be
your mummy anymore, Thea.

01:18:55.298 --> 01:18:58.065
She never cared about you.

01:18:58.067 --> 01:19:00.167
Only herself.

01:19:02.839 --> 01:19:04.839
In all these years...

01:19:04.841 --> 01:19:08.843
has anything ever
actually harmed her?

01:19:10.413 --> 01:19:12.012
No!

01:19:12.014 --> 01:19:15.916
To be the mother
of such a beautiful child,

01:19:15.918 --> 01:19:19.253
you have to accept her.

01:19:19.255 --> 01:19:22.356
And the bruises
that come with her!

01:19:25.061 --> 01:19:28.162
Come here, come on.
Come with me.

01:19:47.917 --> 01:19:49.216
[Scurrying noises]

01:19:52.555 --> 01:19:54.221
[distant chittering]

01:19:58.861 --> 01:20:00.494
Make the circle, Thea.

01:20:05.568 --> 01:20:09.270
[Elizabeth whispering
incantation]

01:20:36.032 --> 01:20:38.399
[distant snarling]

01:20:42.271 --> 01:20:45.172
It's been feeding off me
for so long...

01:20:46.843 --> 01:20:49.076
just want to be free from it.

01:20:49.078 --> 01:20:52.279
I need you to take it from me.

01:20:52.281 --> 01:20:56.917
You told me, if I was sick
you'd help me.

01:20:56.919 --> 01:20:59.386
I'm sick now, Thea.

01:21:00.623 --> 01:21:04.358
It's your responsibility now.

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.594
I promised you to it.

01:21:06.596 --> 01:21:08.162
[Mute screeching]

01:21:08.164 --> 01:21:11.065
Step out of the circle.

01:21:11.067 --> 01:21:14.201
- No!
- [Elizabeth] It won't hurt you.

01:21:14.203 --> 01:21:16.570
It's like your mummy,
it can look after you.

01:21:16.572 --> 01:21:19.473
- No!
- Step out of the circle!

01:21:19.475 --> 01:21:22.910
- It will hurt me.
- Thea, you have to trust me!

01:21:22.912 --> 01:21:24.912
[Thea] No, you're a liar!

01:21:24.914 --> 01:21:26.280
[Creature roaring]

01:21:26.282 --> 01:21:29.283
[groaning]

01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:35.189
Thea!

01:21:35.191 --> 01:21:38.626
[Rustling noises]

01:21:38.628 --> 01:21:40.995
Help me, Thea.

01:21:40.997 --> 01:21:44.531
[Growling, snarling]

01:21:44.533 --> 01:21:46.667
[Elizabeth shrieks]

01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:50.671
[creature roaring]

01:21:50.673 --> 01:21:53.340
[Elizabeth shrieking]

01:21:58.948 --> 01:22:03.684
[creature snorting, chomping]

01:22:03.686 --> 01:22:05.519
[roars]

01:22:25.474 --> 01:22:28.542
[creature squealing]

01:22:33.683 --> 01:22:36.483
[Thea shrieks]

01:22:40.389 --> 01:22:42.589
[snarling]

01:22:54.670 --> 01:22:57.538
[creature snarling]

01:22:57.540 --> 01:23:00.674
[Thea] Run, Mummy!
Into the circle, run!

01:23:00.676 --> 01:23:04.078
[Creature squealing]

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.680
Are you OK? Are you OK?

01:23:06.682 --> 01:23:10.317
[Thea] I didn't mean to.
It was an accident.

01:23:10.319 --> 01:23:13.687
[Thea sobbing]

01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:24.565
[whispering]
Mummy, it's still out there.

01:23:27.703 --> 01:23:29.503
OK, OK.

01:23:29.505 --> 01:23:32.306
- [Creature snarling]
- Can you get rid of it?

01:23:32.308 --> 01:23:36.510
I need to push it back
but I'm not good at that.

01:23:36.512 --> 01:23:40.180
Yes, you are, you are.
I know you are.

01:23:40.182 --> 01:23:45.552
- What do you have to do?
- I have to imagine it.

01:23:45.554 --> 01:23:47.654
OK, describe it to me.

01:23:47.656 --> 01:23:49.123
[Snarling]

01:23:49.125 --> 01:23:53.060
- Cold...
- Is it wet or dry?

01:23:53.062 --> 01:23:57.431
It's wet, like granddad's blood.

01:24:03.539 --> 01:24:04.805
OK.

01:24:04.807 --> 01:24:08.475
Hey, you need to push it away.

01:24:08.477 --> 01:24:11.645
I want you to push it away
so it can't hurt you.

01:24:13.182 --> 01:24:15.315
Yeah?

01:24:17.219 --> 01:24:19.486
Zaqueo before me,
Zaqueo behind me,

01:24:19.488 --> 01:24:22.222
Zaqueo to my right,
Zaqueo to my left...

01:24:22.224 --> 01:24:23.290
[snarling]

01:24:23.292 --> 01:24:27.694

01:24:29.231 --> 01:24:33.700
[whispered incantations
continue]

01:24:33.702 --> 01:24:37.638
[creature roaring,
Thea whispering]

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:39.706
...within me, I am safe,

01:24:39.708 --> 01:24:45.079
within me I am safe,
within me I am safe...

01:25:15.878 --> 01:25:18.779
[swing set creaking]

01:25:44.607 --> 01:25:48.642
[Thea] It's OK, Mummy.
It doesn't hurt.
