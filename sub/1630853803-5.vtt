00:31.532 --> 00:32.950
- Look. Come on!
- Run!

01:02.646 --> 01:03.814
Thanks.

01:11.530 --> 01:13.448
I'm sorry. I didn't know who else to call.

01:16.326 --> 01:17.327
You okay?

01:19.663 --> 01:21.415
No. I don't know.

01:23.625 --> 01:26.378
I thought at least some things in my life
made sense.

01:28.714 --> 01:32.342
This makes sense. You and me.

01:41.018 --> 01:43.270
I found out something about my mum.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.732
I guess she was sick.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.233
Psychotic disorder.

01:49.693 --> 01:52.821
My therapist told me
it could be hereditary.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.703
You should've seen the way
she looked at me.

02:00.871 --> 02:02.998
So concerned.

02:03.999 --> 02:06.919
I'm just so sick of people
looking at me like that.

02:07.503 --> 02:10.923
It just feels like all anyone sees
is this baggage.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.592
What I did, what they think I did.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.594
Every time I'm ten minutes late,

02:15.677 --> 02:18.138
someone thinks I've gone
and jumped off a bridge.

02:18.222 --> 02:20.015
There's nothing wrong with you, Sophie.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.184
But what if there is?

02:22.893 --> 02:26.980
What if this is something
that's always been in me?

02:27.481 --> 02:28.899
You decide who you are.

02:32.945 --> 02:34.613
Yeah. I hope you're right.

02:35.822 --> 02:36.823
Look at me.

02:39.034 --> 02:40.744
I know this situation you're in,

02:42.162 --> 02:45.123
it feels like you're at the center
of it all, but you didn't do this.

02:45.207 --> 02:47.251
This was other people's crimes.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.711
You just got caught up in it.

02:57.970 --> 03:00.514
I don't wanna go back
to that perfect house,

03:01.682 --> 03:03.559
pretend to be the good wife.

03:05.227 --> 03:07.855
You know,
you won't have to pretend much longer.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.858
I got a meeting today.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.277
I get what I need,
they'll arrest James tonight.

03:16.780 --> 03:20.158
- Holy shit. We're doing this.
- Yeah. We're doing this.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.584
<i>You've reached Sophie Ellis.
Leave a message.</i>

04:57.673 --> 04:59.675
- Looks like they're done now.
- Thanks.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.803
I'm gonna be out for lunch,
so you text me if anything comes up.

05:02.886 --> 05:03.887
Of course.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.765
What up, buddy?
We gonna lunch like ladies or what?

05:06.849 --> 05:07.850
Sure.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.435
Perk up. You're buying today.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.272
What are you talking about?

05:14.815 --> 05:16.567
You said you needed help. I'm helping.

05:19.945 --> 05:22.322
Sorry. Nope. Short lunch today.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.618
I got a loan. Just came in.

05:26.702 --> 05:29.329
The escrow just cleared 20 minutes ago.
It's a done deal.

05:29.413 --> 05:32.457
There are some strings, but nothing
we can't cut loose down the road.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.835
Fuck me.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.086
Yeah, fuck you is right.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.380
What about the investigation?

05:38.463 --> 05:40.048
Funds will hit the account tonight.

05:40.132 --> 05:42.634
By tomorrow, the only thing
MacKenzie will be focused on

05:42.718 --> 05:45.429
is rebooking that girls' trip to Cabo.

05:45.512 --> 05:48.807
And the fact that this is wire fraud,
I mean, Miranda's just gonna ignore that?

05:48.891 --> 05:51.602
So the board finds out we moved
some money for the sake of optics.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.438
What do you think they're gonna do?
Set a Zoom with the FBI?

05:56.398 --> 05:58.400
What about your thing?
Did that come through?

05:58.483 --> 05:59.902
It will.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.069
Good. Great.

06:01.570 --> 06:02.821
Yeah.

06:02.905 --> 06:05.282
Hey, buddy. Relax.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.366
Yeah.

06:06.450 --> 06:10.120
Now you're just a regular rich guy,
in debt up to his balls.

06:10.204 --> 06:13.832
But a criminal?
Nah, you were never cool enough for that.

06:25.552 --> 06:26.678
Hey, Vic.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.555
- Hey.
- You taking lunch?

06:28.639 --> 06:33.519
Kyle should be here any minute to cover.
Tell him I'll be back in 45?

06:33.602 --> 06:35.020
Yeah, sure. No problem.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.120
Okay. Fuck.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.089
Okay.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.059
Hold on. I left something in the office.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.769
- I'll meet you over there.
- Okay.

07:22.818 --> 07:25.737
Hell yeah, baby. Easy money.

07:29.700 --> 07:30.868
Okay.

07:53.891 --> 07:55.726
Hey, you're back.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.144
What are you doing in here?

07:58.228 --> 08:00.689
I was just thirsty.

08:02.399 --> 08:05.068
Boss forgot his wallet
going to some fancy lunch.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.196
Guess he has something to celebrate.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.661
If you could restock the fridge,
that'd be great.

08:15.287 --> 08:16.914
Yeah, sure. No problem.

08:32.888 --> 08:35.474
Let's go. Come on.

08:35.557 --> 08:36.683
Let's go.

08:37.643 --> 08:38.644
Yes.

08:55.786 --> 08:56.828
You cold?

08:57.913 --> 08:58.914
I'm fine.

09:04.962 --> 09:06.255
I know that look.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.592
Same look you give me
every time you're about to leave.

09:11.927 --> 09:14.513
I told you, I don't have anywhere to be.

09:30.779 --> 09:31.864
I gotta take this.

09:35.826 --> 09:37.619
- Hey.
- Hey, man. It's me.

09:37.703 --> 09:39.746
I did it. I got everything you asked for.

09:39.830 --> 09:40.831
Where are you?

09:41.498 --> 09:43.125
I'm on lunch. But I can meet tonight.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.502
No, we need to do it now.
I'll pick you up.

09:47.087 --> 09:47.921
Fuck. Okay.

09:48.630 --> 09:50.507
<i>Hey, you got any more of those pills?</i>

09:50.591 --> 09:52.593
Are you really asking me
for drugs right now?

09:53.385 --> 09:57.014
Well, I mean, I did the job.
So, don't you kinda owe me?

10:05.147 --> 10:07.357
It was that lightweight idiot
working for me.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.027
He's into synthetic psychedelics.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.945
Like that real Burning Man shit.

10:12.029 --> 10:13.030
Hallucinogens?

10:13.113 --> 10:14.948
Yeah. Why?

10:15.908 --> 10:17.701
I saw this doctor.

10:19.161 --> 10:21.914
He said they can help you remember.

10:23.207 --> 10:26.418
Create new cerebral connections.

10:27.211 --> 10:28.253
What kind of doctor?

10:29.338 --> 10:31.256
It was just on the Internet.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.468
You don't want to try this shit, trust me.

10:36.345 --> 10:38.555
They make it in a garage in Richmond.

10:38.639 --> 10:41.141
Not exactly what I'd call quality control.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.031
Sorry.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.408
Comes with the territory.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.328
You don't have to apologize.

11:18.887 --> 11:22.891
Pretty soon this will all be over.
All you have to do is be yourself.

11:51.587 --> 11:54.006
Sophie, it's Hannah.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.633
I missed you today.

11:58.177 --> 12:01.180
<i>I know what I told you last time
shook you up.</i>

12:03.056 --> 12:08.562
<i>James and I, we only hid this from you
because we were trying to protect you.</i>

12:10.772 --> 12:12.566
<i>I'm worried about you, Sophie.</i>

12:14.735 --> 12:17.487
Please call me back.

12:26.747 --> 12:27.956
Is it good stuff?

12:31.335 --> 12:35.088
Speaking of stuff,
did you happen to bring the pills?

12:35.172 --> 12:38.008
I mean, if you didn't, it's okay.
I can wait or whatever.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.968
- Is this it?
- What do you mean?

12:40.052 --> 12:42.679
- There's nothing here.
- No, I downloaded everything there was.

12:42.763 --> 12:45.933
I asked for actual proof.
Account numbers, transaction histories.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.019
All you delivered was some petty expenses
and his Pornhub history,

12:49.102 --> 12:51.396
which is probably yours, considering
you've been jacking off all day.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.232
Look, I'm trying to be cool here, man.

12:53.899 --> 12:56.109
Okay, but that's everything, I swear.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.737
I risked my fucking life
to get those files.

12:58.820 --> 12:59.905
Jesus Christ.

13:04.993 --> 13:08.080
Look, he's got a laptop
that he takes home every night.

13:08.163 --> 13:11.375
If there was something illegal,
it'd be smart to put it on there, right?

13:11.458 --> 13:13.502
That way admin doesn't have the password.

14:01.175 --> 14:02.176
What?

14:03.719 --> 14:06.180
I didn't realize the party
had already started.

14:08.098 --> 14:09.183
Want a drink?

14:09.266 --> 14:12.227
No, thanks. Is that what you're wearing?

14:13.020 --> 14:14.021
What do you think?

14:15.480 --> 14:17.774
You know it's black tie, right?

14:20.527 --> 14:22.196
Is this not black enough for you?

14:24.114 --> 14:27.117
Sorry.
I wasn't trying to tell you what to wear.

14:33.332 --> 14:35.250
You were up early this morning.

14:37.419 --> 14:38.837
How was therapy?

14:40.047 --> 14:41.715
I think I'm done with Hannah.

14:42.966 --> 14:44.718
It's just not working out.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.055
But maybe you already know that.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.098
You guys talk, right?

14:53.393 --> 14:55.604
Are you ready?
The car will be here any minute.

14:57.981 --> 15:00.400
Maybe we should skip tonight.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.612
You really don't like my outfit.

15:03.695 --> 15:05.572
Look, I'm worried about you, Sophie.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.033
What did I do now?

15:08.825 --> 15:12.704
Look, the past couple of days,
ever since the hotel, you've been--

15:14.414 --> 15:16.416
you've been acting a little erratic.

15:20.671 --> 15:24.132
It's Caroline's gala.
She's expecting us to be there.

15:24.216 --> 15:26.468
I don't care about Caroline.

15:27.135 --> 15:29.471
That's a mean thing to say
about my best friend,

15:29.972 --> 15:31.974
especially since you two were fucking.

15:36.395 --> 15:37.646
Car's here.

15:41.817 --> 15:44.319
We've both made mistakes, you know.

15:46.196 --> 15:47.948
Try to have fun tonight.

15:48.031 --> 15:50.617
Might be the last big party
we go to for a while.

15:56.707 --> 15:57.708
Hello.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.506
My husband will just be a minute.

16:04.590 --> 16:05.591
Okay. Yeah.

16:13.348 --> 16:15.267
I hate these parties, you know.

16:16.685 --> 16:19.313
The same crowd talking about
everything and nothing.

16:19.980 --> 16:21.940
Pretending to be something they're not.

16:25.068 --> 16:27.571
Maybe I'll just try being myself for once.

16:29.615 --> 16:30.616
What do you think?

16:31.408 --> 16:33.410
Yes, ma'am. You do you.

16:57.476 --> 16:59.311
Palace of Fine Arts, please.

16:59.394 --> 17:00.729
Yeah. Let's go.

17:56.118 --> 17:57.244
Whiskey soda, please.

18:06.461 --> 18:07.462
Enjoy.

18:10.340 --> 18:12.634
- What's going on?
- Hey. James with you?

18:13.135 --> 18:14.720
<i>Not this second.</i>

18:14.803 --> 18:17.598
Good. I need you to disable
the security system at your house.

18:17.681 --> 18:19.474
What for?

18:19.558 --> 18:21.310
<i>I need James's laptop.</i>

18:21.393 --> 18:24.146
<i>It'll be quick and painless
as long as you take care of the alarm.</i>

18:27.107 --> 18:30.652
The code to get inside is 7764.
But he'll see you on the cameras.

18:30.736 --> 18:32.362
I can't turn them off.
It's done from his phone.

18:32.446 --> 18:34.114
Okay, but he's with you, right?

18:34.198 --> 18:36.867
<i>What are you looking for?
I thought we had everything we need.</i>

18:36.950 --> 18:38.869
<i>This is the last step, I promise you.</i>

18:38.952 --> 18:40.078
Good to see you.

18:40.162 --> 18:41.413
Give me ten minutes.

18:41.496 --> 18:44.291
Text me when the cameras are down.
I'll let you know when I'm done.

18:50.255 --> 18:52.633
Yeah. It's…

19:05.604 --> 19:08.106
There you are.
I've been looking everywhere.

19:08.190 --> 19:09.191
Hey.

19:10.651 --> 19:12.528
I'm sorry about before.

19:16.114 --> 19:16.990
Excuse me.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.580
I don't think it's really that simple,
is it?

19:23.664 --> 19:26.208
It can be. If you want.

19:27.376 --> 19:30.045
You were right. We've both made mistakes.

19:31.505 --> 19:35.050
And we can choose to wallow in them,
or not.

19:35.551 --> 19:37.010
Don't blame Caroline.

19:38.262 --> 19:40.264
No one can keep a secret forever.

19:45.477 --> 19:47.980
You look so handsome.

19:48.480 --> 19:49.773
Let's take a photo.

19:50.858 --> 19:52.025
- Yeah.
- It's been a while.

19:52.651 --> 19:54.736
Use your phone. My camera's never as good.

20:04.955 --> 20:06.164
Is it good?

20:06.248 --> 20:07.541
- Wow.
- Let's see.

20:15.007 --> 20:16.383
This one?

20:21.096 --> 20:22.347
Wow, you…

20:24.183 --> 20:25.184
look beautiful.

20:29.354 --> 20:30.439
You need a drink.

20:30.981 --> 20:31.982
Sure.

20:32.065 --> 20:33.609
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

23:08.847 --> 23:10.057
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

23:10.599 --> 23:12.184
- Did you just get here?
- No.

23:12.768 --> 23:13.894
Have you seen Sophie?

23:13.977 --> 23:15.395
No. Why?

23:15.479 --> 23:17.689
Yeah, she's probably just mingling
somewhere.

23:18.190 --> 23:19.316
Are you worried?

23:21.276 --> 23:22.736
Yeah, she's been drinking.

23:23.237 --> 23:24.238
Fun.

23:24.780 --> 23:26.114
I'll look out for her.

23:26.782 --> 23:28.283
Okay. Yeah, thanks.

23:44.591 --> 23:45.592
There you are.

23:47.594 --> 23:48.595
Hi.

23:57.229 --> 23:58.605
Do you know who she is?

24:00.190 --> 24:03.277
Ophelia. From <i>Hamlet</i>.

24:04.820 --> 24:05.821
<i>Hamlet?</i>

24:08.949 --> 24:12.327
I'm just joking, Caroline.
I've seen <i>Shakespeare In Love.</i>

24:17.374 --> 24:18.625
I'm really glad you came.

24:18.709 --> 24:21.670
I'm-- I didn't know you were gonna come.

24:22.588 --> 24:25.716
Caroline, I'm not mad.

24:26.842 --> 24:28.510
If anything, I'm grateful.

24:29.219 --> 24:31.471
I know the other day was hard for you,

24:32.598 --> 24:33.765
but it helped me.

24:34.558 --> 24:35.601
It did?

24:36.185 --> 24:39.062
Every truth is a piece of my puzzle,

24:40.480 --> 24:41.899
even the ugly parts.

24:43.442 --> 24:47.779
And, you know, this whole time,
that's what I've been doing.

24:49.198 --> 24:51.700
- What?
- Finding the missing pieces.

24:52.659 --> 24:54.161
And not even you can help me.

24:55.204 --> 24:56.914
But I never really let you, did I?

24:58.123 --> 25:00.959
Are you and James okay?

25:01.919 --> 25:04.129
Don't worry about James.

25:06.173 --> 25:07.341
You seem different.

25:09.343 --> 25:10.385
Maybe I am.

25:16.892 --> 25:18.602
She's so peaceful.

25:21.271 --> 25:22.314
She's dead.

25:23.398 --> 25:25.901
- There she is.
- Caroline, are you coming?

25:26.652 --> 25:28.111
Your friends are waiting.

25:28.195 --> 25:29.321
Okay.

25:29.947 --> 25:31.949
I'll just say hello, okay?

25:34.034 --> 25:35.327
Hi.

29:29.269 --> 29:30.604
Sophie.

29:30.687 --> 29:31.772
Sophie?

29:55.254 --> 29:58.131
James was looking for you.

29:59.216 --> 30:00.425
What? Why?

30:02.761 --> 30:03.929
What's going on with you?

30:06.181 --> 30:07.182
I have to go.

30:10.143 --> 30:11.311
Sophie.

30:42.926 --> 30:46.555
- Hey, have you seen Sophie?
- Yeah, about an hour ago. What's happened?

30:49.141 --> 30:50.809
I thought we had an agreement.

30:51.435 --> 30:53.270
The wire transfer went through
this afternoon.

30:53.353 --> 30:56.523
No. Not about the money.
About us. Why did you tell her?

30:56.607 --> 30:58.567
Well, what were you gonna do?
Lie to her forever?

30:58.650 --> 31:00.611
It wasn't your place to say anything.

31:00.694 --> 31:03.614
I'm sorry, what is my place?
Under you, getting quietly fucked?

31:04.740 --> 31:05.949
Sophie is my friend.

31:06.033 --> 31:08.035
Your friend is my wife.

31:08.118 --> 31:10.162
Everything I've done has been
to protect Sophie.

31:10.245 --> 31:11.288
Do you remember what happened?

31:11.371 --> 31:14.416
She took a dive off a fucking ferry
into a bay.

31:14.499 --> 31:17.836
She wasn't supposed to come back,
but she did. So, yeah. You know what?

31:17.920 --> 31:20.797
I'll lie my fucking face off
to forget that version of her

31:20.881 --> 31:22.049
so she can forget it too.

31:22.132 --> 31:23.884
Get a second chance,
that's what this is all about.

31:23.967 --> 31:25.636
- That's what it's ever been about.
- Stop.

31:25.719 --> 31:28.263
She does not know what is real, James.

31:28.347 --> 31:31.642
She is not on solid ground
and it's driving her crazy.

31:32.184 --> 31:34.102
I don't understand how you can't see that.

31:35.395 --> 31:37.648
I'm sorry.
I know you're worried about her.

31:37.731 --> 31:39.608
I am worried about her too.
Let me call her.

31:39.691 --> 31:41.193
No, don't. She's not answering.

31:42.361 --> 31:44.696
Hold on. Hey, this is James.

31:44.780 --> 31:46.073
Sophie just left.

31:46.156 --> 31:47.533
What, by herself?

31:47.616 --> 31:50.494
She seemed pretty fucked up.
I've never seen her like that before.

31:50.577 --> 31:52.329
Did you guys take anything tonight?

31:52.412 --> 31:53.539
What do you mean?

31:53.622 --> 31:56.834
I mean, she was Coachella, day three,
clearly missing the bus.

31:57.668 --> 31:59.837
- Thanks.
- What's happening?

31:59.920 --> 32:01.797
Was she on something when you saw her?

32:03.841 --> 32:05.300
Shit, maybe.

32:05.384 --> 32:07.678
- Oh, fuck.
- I'm calling her.

32:07.761 --> 32:08.929
I'm going.

32:09.012 --> 32:10.055
Where?

32:10.138 --> 32:11.139
Home.

32:26.071 --> 32:28.949
"Minnesota Maniac." Fucking douchebag.

32:51.388 --> 32:54.016
<i>You've reached Sophie Ellis.
Leave a message.</i>

32:56.185 --> 32:57.811
Hi, it's me. I have it.

32:57.895 --> 32:59.688
Everything was tracked.

32:59.771 --> 33:03.192
He mapped the whole thing out,
including the last action.

33:04.067 --> 33:08.405
The day before your accident,
3.1 million to a bank downtown.

34:04.837 --> 34:05.921
Is that for me?

34:09.132 --> 34:10.259
Was that for me?

34:13.219 --> 34:14.304
Need a drink?

34:21.061 --> 34:22.478
A beer, please.

34:31.530 --> 34:32.697
What the hell?

34:35.033 --> 34:36.243
Shit.

34:46.962 --> 34:48.172
Sophie?

34:53.051 --> 34:54.219
Sophie?

35:00.684 --> 35:02.227
Fuck, Sophie.

35:13.447 --> 35:14.698
Sophie?

35:22.331 --> 35:23.373
Fuck.

36:00.994 --> 36:02.037
Tess?

36:09.628 --> 36:10.921
Do I know you?

36:24.309 --> 36:26.979
I don't mean to keep staring.

36:27.062 --> 36:29.815
You just look like someone I used to know.

36:30.524 --> 36:31.900
You okay?

36:32.943 --> 36:34.862
I took something tonight.

36:36.822 --> 36:41.577
I guess I was just testing myself,
see what would happen.

36:43.328 --> 36:44.913
Did you pass?

36:48.709 --> 36:50.210
Go on, then. Just say it.

36:52.004 --> 36:56.675
The last time I saw you
was a long time ago.

36:56.758 --> 37:02.598
I don't remember much,
but it wasn't good, was it?

37:03.307 --> 37:04.308
No.

37:05.809 --> 37:06.810
Right.

37:10.314 --> 37:14.818
I've lost everything. Do you know that?
I don't remember anything.

37:16.403 --> 37:18.864
So, why is this the one thing
that keeps coming back?

37:19.448 --> 37:20.657
I don't know.

37:20.741 --> 37:24.870
You must know something.
Why did I run away from you?

37:24.953 --> 37:30.959
Because that's your thing, Tess.
That's what you do. Run.

37:31.919 --> 37:34.755
You get what you want from someone
and then you're gone.

37:35.881 --> 37:37.799
You don't care about the mess
you leave behind.

37:37.883 --> 37:41.386
But that's not who I am now.
I don't want to be that person.

37:41.470 --> 37:44.097
Well, it's a little late
for me on that one, isn't it?

37:47.684 --> 37:49.269
Just tell me this.

37:50.729 --> 37:52.147
Are you okay?

37:53.398 --> 37:54.399
Now?

37:56.443 --> 37:57.945
You're okay, right?

37:58.028 --> 38:03.367
Of course. The past is the past, right?

38:09.039 --> 38:10.332
Shit.

38:10.415 --> 38:11.834
It's okay. It's just a drink.

39:27.951 --> 39:30.078
Come on. Let's dance.

39:43.884 --> 39:44.885
Let me go.

39:44.968 --> 39:47.596
What? Why?

39:53.810 --> 39:57.689
- I need to get out of here.
- You can't run from who you are, Tess.

40:03.654 --> 40:04.613
Tess.

41:05.299 --> 41:06.300
Hello?

41:06.383 --> 41:07.634
Where are you, Sophie?

41:08.385 --> 41:11.346
<i>I've been calling all night.
I got everything we need.</i>

41:12.055 --> 41:13.891
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

41:14.600 --> 41:18.437
I never should have taken the pills.
I'm so fucking stupid.

41:18.520 --> 41:19.438
Wait, what pills?

41:21.315 --> 41:22.149
<i>Sophie?</i>

41:23.817 --> 41:25.110
<i>Look, I'm coming to get you.</i>

41:26.445 --> 41:27.946
<i>Sophie. Stay on the phone.</i>

41:28.906 --> 41:31.825
Do you think patterns
always repeat themselves?

41:32.576 --> 41:36.496
Like we're all stuck
in some dysfunctional cycle,

41:36.580 --> 41:39.541
and you always end up right back
where you started?

41:39.625 --> 41:41.251
Sophie, where are you?

41:41.877 --> 41:42.961
<i>I don't know.</i>

41:43.045 --> 41:45.839
Okay, look for a street name or number.
First one you see.

41:47.466 --> 41:49.259
333.

41:50.302 --> 41:51.637
Sophie, where are you?

41:51.720 --> 41:54.264
<i>Sophie, just go home. I'll meet you there.</i>

41:54.348 --> 41:59.228
<i>Don't hang up, Sophie.
Sophie, you hear me? Sophie!</i>

44:27.626 --> 44:28.627
Can I help you?

44:29.628 --> 44:31.797
Just here to make sure
Sophie gets home okay.

44:33.131 --> 44:34.132
Do I know you?

44:35.217 --> 44:36.301
You should.

44:39.555 --> 44:41.139
You're the fucking guy.

44:41.723 --> 44:43.058
No, you're the fucking guy.

44:46.228 --> 44:48.230
If you're gonna fuck someone up
with a screwdriver,

44:48.313 --> 44:50.274
you should use a flathead
and not a Phillips.

44:58.740 --> 45:00.576
- Have you heard from her?
- Yeah.

45:01.743 --> 45:03.495
Is she okay?

45:06.248 --> 45:07.749
Of course, you don't know.

45:07.833 --> 45:09.793
You don't know anything
about my fucking wife.

45:09.877 --> 45:12.129
I know her a lot better
than you'd be comfortable with.

45:12.212 --> 45:14.256
Get off my property,
or I'm calling the cops.

45:14.339 --> 45:16.508
No need. I'm already here.

45:19.428 --> 45:20.596
What, the car?

45:21.180 --> 45:22.264
It's not standard issue,

45:22.347 --> 45:24.641
but it can still show up
at your house whenever the fuck it wants.

45:30.022 --> 45:31.982
Nice to meet you, Minnesota Maniac.

46:11.813 --> 46:13.190
Are you okay?

46:16.443 --> 46:18.445
Where does that boat go?

46:20.614 --> 46:24.076
Industrial peninsula.
About 30 minutes away.

46:24.952 --> 46:26.036
What's there?

46:26.119 --> 46:29.248
Sulfur works, public storage.

46:31.166 --> 46:32.251
An airport too.

46:34.586 --> 46:35.796
Airport?

46:35.879 --> 46:38.173
Yep. Private planes.

47:38.483 --> 47:40.277
<i>Hi, it's me. I have it.</i>

47:40.360 --> 47:42.779
<i>Shelled the money into offshore accounts,
just like I said he would.</i>

47:42.863 --> 47:43.989
<i>Everything was tracked.</i>

47:44.072 --> 47:46.742
<i>He mapped the whole thing out,
including the last action.</i>

47:46.825 --> 47:50.662
<i>On the day before your accident,
3.1 million to a bank downtown.</i>

47:51.288 --> 47:54.249
<i>The money is in an account
under the name Tess Caldwell.</i>

47:54.917 --> 47:59.546
<i>It has to be him. Who else could it be?
Call me as soon as you get this.</i>

48:31.787 --> 48:33.163
Sophie.

48:45.926 --> 48:47.094
Sophie.

49:15.706 --> 49:17.332
Thanks for coming, Officer.

49:33.765 --> 49:38.228
Sophie. I am so glad you're okay.

49:39.646 --> 49:41.440
Look, we need to talk.

49:41.523 --> 49:44.693
Whatever we've been doing,
clearly it's not working. We--

49:44.776 --> 49:46.904
It's not working
because you're lying to me.

49:51.074 --> 49:55.704
The person you were covering for.
The missing money…

49:57.664 --> 49:59.249
Was it me?

50:04.129 --> 50:05.255
Yeah.

50:07.799 --> 50:09.051
It was you.

50:12.095 --> 50:14.097
You have to tell me the truth.
