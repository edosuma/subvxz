09:57.697 --> 09:59.699
PEOPLE MAY NOT WANT TO DEAL WITH

SEX WITHOUT IT BEING KNOWN TO

11:58.384 --> 12:00.453
THE GENERAL PUBLIC.

12:00.519 --> 12:02.188
MY LAST RELATIONSHIP WAS

12:13.966 --> 12:14.333
KNEW ABOUT ME.

MUCH OF ME INTO IT THAT I FELT

12:37.756 --> 12:38.791
THE LIFE THAT I DESERVE OR I'M

13:04.483 --> 13:05.251
OUT THE GUN.

13:05.317 --> 13:07.620

13:33.812 --> 13:34.380
WENT STRAIGHT THROUGH MY ARM AND

17:22.207 --> 17:28.447
JUST AS BEING WHO YOU ARE.

17:28.514 --> 17:30.249
KE'AIRA WAS LIFE, SHE WAS LIKE A

17:30.315 --> 17:32.785
SMILE.

17:32.851 --> 17:35.154
SO FOR ME TO JUST SIT AROUND AND

17:35.220 --> 17:37.356
JUST WALLOW IN MY SORROW, SHE

17:37.423 --> 17:48.233
WOULDN'T WANT THAT.

17:48.300 --> 17:51.303
>> THE WATER IS SO COMFORTING.

17:51.370 --> 17:52.438
>> IT IS.

17:52.504 --> 17:56.542
>> I LOVE IT.

17:56.608 --> 17:58.010
>> MY GRANDMOTHER, SHE'S ALWAYS

17:58.076 --> 18:00.112
BEEN A GIVER BUT HASN'T TAKEN

18:00.179 --> 18:01.713
TIME OUT TO TAKE CARE OF

18:01.780 --> 18:03.916
HERSELF.

18:03.982 --> 18:05.517
I WANT TO GIVE BACK TO MY

18:05.584 --> 18:07.619
GRANDMOTHER BECAUSE DEBORAH'S

18:07.686 --> 18:10.022
LOVE AND SUPPORT IS

18:10.088 --> 18:12.491
UNCONDITIONAL LOVE AND SUPPORT.

18:12.558 --> 18:13.492
>> Eureka: OH MY GOODNESS I'M SO

18:13.559 --> 18:14.393
EXCITED TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.662
>> PLEASURE.

18:16.728 --> 18:17.262
>> Eureka: OH, I NEED TO MEET

18:17.329 --> 18:17.863
HER.

18:17.930 --> 18:18.096

18:18.163 --> 18:19.431
>> HEY BABY, HOW ARE YOU DOING?

18:19.498 --> 18:20.098
>> Eureka: YOU ARE ALL SO

18:20.165 --> 18:21.166
GORGEOUS.

18:21.233 --> 18:24.403
OH MY GOD.

18:24.470 --> 18:24.970
I'M SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR

18:25.037 --> 18:26.305
SISTER.

18:26.371 --> 18:27.873
>> KE'AIRA AND I, WE WERE

18:27.940 --> 18:30.776
INSEPARABLE.

18:30.843 --> 18:31.710
I CALLED MY GRANDMOTHER RIGHT

18:31.777 --> 18:33.946
AFTER I GOT THE NEWS AND WE BOTH

18:34.012 --> 18:36.615
WERE DISTRAUGHT REALLY.

18:36.682 --> 18:37.683
>> NOW THAT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME

18:37.749 --> 18:40.352
TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE YOU KNOW

18:40.419 --> 18:42.087
IT KEEPS HAPPENING TIME AND TIME

18:42.154 --> 18:44.656
AGAIN, MY GRANDDAD, MY GRANDMOM,

18:44.723 --> 18:46.592
MY NEPHEW.

18:46.658 --> 18:48.460
I'VE HAD TWO DEATHS WITHIN MY

18:48.527 --> 18:49.795
FAMILY WITHIN THE LAST THREE

18:49.862 --> 18:51.463
YEARS.

18:51.530 --> 18:53.932
AND AFTER KE'AIRA PASSED THAT

18:53.999 --> 18:55.167
REALLY CAUGHT A BITE WITH ME.

18:55.234 --> 18:56.735
SERIOUSLY.

18:56.802 --> 18:57.870
>> Eureka: YOU'VE LOST A LOT.

18:57.936 --> 19:01.273
>> I'VE LOST A LOT BUT I HAVE TO

19:01.340 --> 19:06.311
KEEP IT MOVING.

19:06.378 --> 19:06.979
>> SHE'S ACTUALLY HELPED ME WITH

19:07.045 --> 19:10.082
HOW NOT TO STRUGGLE AND YOU KNOW

19:10.148 --> 19:11.817
HOLD ON TO THAT, THAT WEIGHT OF

19:11.884 --> 19:14.486
SORROW.

19:14.553 --> 19:17.089
>> SHE WOULD WANT ME TO CARRY ON

19:17.155 --> 19:19.458
BUT NEVER EVER FORGET ABOUT HER

19:19.525 --> 19:21.527
YOU KNOW JUST CONTINUALLY KEEP

19:21.593 --> 19:23.829
THAT LIGHT BURNING SO THAT'S MY

19:23.896 --> 19:26.965
THING, I'M JUST GONNA KEEP ON

19:27.032 --> 19:28.667
SHINING HER LIGHT.

19:28.734 --> 19:29.635
>> Eureka: ARE YOU LIKE MAMA DEB

19:29.701 --> 19:30.302
OR SOMETHING?

19:30.369 --> 19:32.170
WHAT DO THEY CALL YOU?

19:32.237 --> 19:33.171
>> GRANNY G.

19:33.238 --> 19:34.039
>> Eureka: OH GRANNY G.

19:34.106 --> 19:35.607
>> THAT'S WHAT KE'AIRA NAMED ME

19:35.674 --> 19:35.874
GRANNY G.

19:35.941 --> 19:36.808
>> Eureka: REALLY?

19:36.875 --> 19:37.276
>> YES.

19:37.342 --> 19:37.876
>> Eureka: OH, HO, HO, HO, I

19:37.943 --> 19:38.911
LOVE IT.

19:38.977 --> 19:39.511
>> IT STANDS FOR GANGSTER

19:39.578 --> 19:41.079
GRANNY.

19:41.146 --> 19:42.180
>> Eureka: OH, LOVE IT.

19:42.247 --> 19:43.949
YOU DON'T GOT TO WHISPER THAT

19:44.016 --> 19:46.418
MAMA, SAY IT PROUD.

19:46.485 --> 19:46.919
WHEN YOU'RE A PERSON OF

19:46.985 --> 19:47.819
DIFFERENCE OR YOU'RE QUEER

19:47.886 --> 19:50.489
YOU'RE IN A VULNERABLE SITUATION

19:50.556 --> 19:51.557
HERE IN SELMA, BUT DEBORAH WAS A

19:51.623 --> 19:53.258
HUGE SUPPORT FOR ALKERIOUS AND

19:53.325 --> 19:54.660
KE'AIRA THE TWO QUEER PEOPLE IN

19:54.726 --> 19:56.828
THEIR FAMILY.

19:56.895 --> 19:59.698
SHE GIVES SO MUCH LOVE TO OTHER

19:59.765 --> 20:00.265
PEOPLE, THIS PERFORMANCE IS

20:00.332 --> 20:00.866
GONNA GIVE DEBORAH A MOMENT TO

20:00.933 --> 20:02.267
RECEIVE THE LOVE.

20:02.334 --> 20:02.834
AND I JUST HOPE THAT SHE CAN

20:02.901 --> 20:06.638
ACCEPT IT.

20:06.705 --> 20:07.005
WELL, THANK YOU.

20:07.072 --> 20:07.539
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

20:07.606 --> 20:08.173
>> Eureka: I ADORE YOU ALREADY,

20:08.240 --> 20:09.975
I CAN'T WAIT.

20:10.042 --> 20:14.413
>> MY FAITH.

20:14.479 --> 20:28.260
>> Bob: WE JUST DROVE A BLOCK

20:28.327 --> 20:29.328
AND WE PASSED TWO CHURCHES, TWO

20:29.394 --> 20:30.395
MASSIVE CHURCHES.

20:30.462 --> 20:31.763
>> AND IF YOU GO AROUND A CORNER

20:31.830 --> 20:34.733
IT'S ANOTHER ONE.

20:34.800 --> 20:35.434
THAT'S WHY I'M TAKING THROUGH

20:35.500 --> 20:37.035
THE HOOD BECAUSE I LIKE THIS

20:37.102 --> 20:39.471
LITTLE BRIDGE AND EVERYTHING BUT

20:39.538 --> 20:41.907
YOU NEED TO SEE HOW WE HAVE BEEN

20:41.974 --> 20:45.644
LIVING.

20:45.711 --> 20:49.414
THIS IS THE REAL LOOK OF SELMA.

20:49.481 --> 20:54.987
EVERYTHING IS PRETTY MUCH GONE

20:55.053 --> 20:57.089
THE ONLY THING HERE IS VIOLENCE.

20:57.155 --> 20:57.856
VENEESHA, ONE OF THE DANCERS,

20:57.923 --> 20:59.191
SHE CAME FROM OUT OF HERE.

20:59.257 --> 21:00.459
AND THESE GIRLS IN HERE WERE

21:00.525 --> 21:02.160
GETTING PREGNANT AT LIKE

21:02.227 --> 21:04.329
THIRTEEN, FOURTEEN YEARS OLD.

21:04.396 --> 21:05.330
AND SO THAT'S WHEN I STARTED THE

21:05.397 --> 21:06.131
WHOLE DANCE THING WITH THE

21:06.198 --> 21:07.966
COMMUNITY AND I WAS PULLING

21:08.033 --> 21:09.401
GIRLS LIKE TO GET THEM OUT OF

21:09.468 --> 21:10.702
THE HOOD TO HAVE SOMETHING TO DO

21:10.769 --> 21:13.005
TO HAVE SOMETHING TO LIVE FOR

21:13.071 --> 21:16.608
VERSUS WHAT THEY SEE EVERY DAY.

21:16.675 --> 21:19.378
THE ONLY THING HERE IS VIOLENCE.

21:19.444 --> 21:24.182
LIKE HERE IT'S SO DANGEROUS,

21:24.249 --> 21:25.484
IT'S THE REASON WHY I HATE IT SO

21:25.550 --> 21:26.084
MUCH IS BECAUSE LIKE I'M MORE OF

21:26.151 --> 21:27.953
A TARGET THAN EVERYBODY ELSE

21:28.020 --> 21:28.620
BECAUSE I'M TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

21:28.687 --> 21:31.723
I'M FEELING LIKE IF SOMEONE WAS

21:31.790 --> 21:32.958
TO TAKE ME OUT THEY LITERALLY

21:33.025 --> 21:34.993
WOULD NOT WORK HARD TO FIGURE

21:35.060 --> 21:36.028
OUT WHO DID IT.

21:36.094 --> 21:37.462
>> Bob: YOU DON'T KNOW HOW, HOW

21:37.529 --> 21:39.464
THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WOULD HANDLE

21:39.531 --> 21:40.098
YOU?

21:40.165 --> 21:42.334
>> BECAUSE OF WHAT I WAS, THEY

21:42.401 --> 21:43.335
WILL SAY, OH WELL IT WAS A DEMON

21:43.402 --> 21:44.770
ANYWAY BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY

21:44.836 --> 21:50.475
BELIEVE.

21:50.542 --> 21:52.444
>> Bob: WE DON'T NEED TO DO ANY

21:52.511 --> 21:53.078
WORK ON AKEELAH, WE NEED TO DO

21:53.145 --> 21:56.181
WORK ON EVERYONE ELSE.

21:56.248 --> 21:57.115
IT'S NOT FOR FEAR WHAT AKEELAH'S

21:57.182 --> 21:58.917
GONNA DO TO, TO SELMA, I DON'T

21:58.984 --> 21:59.551
KNOW WHAT SHE DONE, SHE MADE IT

21:59.618 --> 22:00.452
MORE BEAUTIFUL, SHE'S ADDED

22:00.519 --> 22:02.921
DANCE TO IT, SHE'S TAUGHT THE

22:02.988 --> 22:04.222
CHILDREN OF SELMA HOW TO BE

22:04.289 --> 22:05.157
WOMEN, SHE'S, FOR ME SHE'S THE

22:05.223 --> 22:11.329
BIGGEST REASON THAT WE'RE HERE.

22:11.396 --> 22:12.497
>> Shangela: OH HI!

22:12.564 --> 22:12.964
>> OH MY GOSH HI.

22:13.031 --> 22:13.432
>> Shangela: SURPRISE.

22:13.498 --> 22:14.866

22:28.447 --> 22:28.914
AND PUTTING ON A DRAG SHOW

22:28.980 --> 22:30.182
TOGETHER.

22:30.248 --> 22:30.982
>> HE DID MENTION IT TO ME AND

22:31.049 --> 22:32.050
I'M EXCITED.

22:32.117 --> 22:32.718
>> Shangela: HAS HE TOLD YOU

22:32.784 --> 22:32.918

>> Shangela: WHAT DO YOU THINK

22:37.689 --> 22:40.892
ABOUT DRAG?

22:40.959 --> 22:41.693
>> I'VE ALWAYS RESPECTED IT AND

22:41.760 --> 22:43.395
OF COURSE I MEAN LOOK AT ME.

22:43.462 --> 22:44.029
>> Shangela: WHAT DO YOU THINK

22:45.163 --> 22:47.299
>> SO JOSEPH, I'M EXCITED, I

ABLE TO TALK HIM INTO DOING THAT

22:54.573 --> 22:55.207
ON MY OWN, SO I'M EXCITED.

22:55.273 --> 22:56.308
.

22:56.374 --> 22:57.576

22:58.443 --> 23:01.046
I CAN SEE A LITTLE NERVOUS.

23:08.687 --> 23:09.855
BUT I FEEL LIKE I WOULD BE HER

23:09.921 --> 23:11.990

23:19.264 --> 23:20.532
WHEN YOU DID THAT I THINK, OH MY

23:22.534 --> 23:23.568
PROBABLY WOULD DROP DEAD RIGHT

23:23.635 --> 23:25.137
THERE.

23:25.203 --> 23:26.538
AND LORD I CAN'T LET HER SEE IT,

23:26.605 --> 23:30.142
I CAN'T DO IT, I CANNOT DO IT.

23:30.208 --> 23:31.943
BABY, IF MY MAMA WALKED INTO

23:32.010 --> 23:34.646
THAT ROOM I WOULD BE THE FIRST

23:34.713 --> 23:35.347
THING UNDER A TABLE CLOTH, UNDER

23:35.413 --> 23:35.580
A TABLE.

23:35.647 --> 23:39.518
>> NO YOU, NO YOU WON'T.

23:39.584 --> 23:39.851
>> I WOULD.

23:39.918 --> 23:40.352

TO THIS DAY A TOUCHY SUBJECT FOR

23:44.055 --> 23:44.222
MY MOM.

23:44.289 --> 23:44.823
>> Shangela: BUT, BUT LOOK AT

23:44.890 --> 23:45.357
ALL THAT YOU'VE BUILT FOR

23:45.423 --> 23:45.624

23:45.690 --> 23:46.258
YOU HAVE THIS HOME, YOU HAVE A

23:46.324 --> 23:47.559
GARAGE FULL OF CARS, SO MANY

23:47.626 --> 23:48.927
CARS YOU CAN'T EVEN FIT NO MORE

23:48.994 --> 23:49.561
CARS, THEY GOT TO BE UNDER A CAR

23:54.499 --> 23:57.102
BE ASHAMED OF.

23:57.169 --> 23:58.503
RIGHT NOW IT FEELS LIKE JOSEPH

23:58.570 --> 23:59.237
IS EXCLUDING CERTAIN PARTS OF

23:59.304 --> 24:00.806
HIMSELF.

24:00.872 --> 24:03.775
JOSEPH HAS SOME MORE WORK TO DO

24:03.842 --> 24:05.577
TO RELEASE ANY TYPE OF BLAME OR

24:05.644 --> 24:07.579
SHAME.

24:07.646 --> 24:08.914
IT'S A JOURNEY, IT'S A JOURNEY

24:08.980 --> 24:11.783
ABOUT GETTING TO TRYING TO FIND

24:11.850 --> 24:13.552
OUT IF OTHERS ARE GONNA ACCEPT

24:13.618 --> 24:15.086

24:36.441 --> 24:38.310
>> I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED A

24:38.376 --> 24:40.712
GUY GENUINELY LOVING ME AND

24:40.779 --> 24:42.180
LOVING ME IN THE DAYLIGHT UNTIL

24:42.247 --> 24:49.254

31:58.049 --> 31:58.616
FEELS LIKE A SIGNIFICANT MOMENT

31:58.683 --> 32:00.952
IN MY LIFE.

32:01.019 --> 32:01.853
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WATCHED THE

32:01.919 --> 32:02.654

INTERESTED IN HEARING YOUR

32:07.725 --> 32:09.694

OF THE CITIES THAT WE GO INTO SO

32:16.401 --> 32:20.605
THAT WE ARE LEARNING.

32:20.672 --> 32:21.239

32:21.306 --> 32:22.740
WOULD RATHER LIVE IN.

32:22.807 --> 32:24.609
BUT THE WAY SHE'S LOOKING NOW

32:24.676 --> 32:26.778
SADDENS US BECAUSE SHE IS A

32:26.844 --> 32:28.579
GLORIOUS CITY AND SHE GAVE THE

32:28.646 --> 32:32.950
WORLD SO MUCH.

32:33.017 --> 32:35.153
WE ALL GREW UP WITHIN TWO BLOCKS

32:35.219 --> 32:37.322
OF EACH OTHER.

32:37.388 --> 32:38.690
THE STUDENTS HAD STARTED

32:38.756 --> 32:41.926
MARCHING.

32:41.993 --> 32:42.560
>> MY GRANDMOTHER WOULD TAKE US

32:42.627 --> 32:45.330
TO THE MEETINGS.

32:45.396 --> 32:45.963
>> WE WOULD JUST SIT THERE

WAITING FOR DOCTOR KING TO COME

32:47.598 --> 32:49.534
IN THE CHURCH AND WE HUNG ON HIS

>> YES.

32:53.237 --> 32:55.073
AND EVEN AT THIRTEEN YEARS OLD I

32:55.139 --> 32:57.942
FELT THAT THIS MAN WAS TALKING

32:58.009 --> 32:59.811
TO ME.

32:59.877 --> 33:01.479
AND HE SAID THAT YOU COULD GET

33:01.546 --> 33:03.214
ANYBODY TO DO ANYTHING WITH

33:03.281 --> 33:06.050
STEADY LOVING CONFRONTATION.

33:06.117 --> 33:15.159
THAT'S WHY I WAS ON THAT BRIDGE

33:15.226 --> 33:18.162
ON MARCH 7TH, 1965.

33:18.229 --> 33:18.796
I RECEIVED THIRTY-FIVE STITCHES

33:18.863 --> 33:21.199
ON THAT BRIDGE THAT DAY.

33:21.265 --> 33:24.969
THIS SHERIFF'S DEPUTY HIT ME.

33:25.036 --> 33:28.906
AFTER THIS MAN HAD HIT ME AND

33:28.973 --> 33:29.640
PUSHED ME I WAS ABLE TO GET UP

33:29.707 --> 33:30.808
AND RUN INTO A CLOUD OF TEAR

33:30.875 --> 33:33.878
GAS.

33:33.945 --> 33:35.246
I ACTUALLY FELL, THE STATE

33:35.313 --> 33:37.148
TROOPER KICKED ME AND HE KICKED

33:37.215 --> 33:41.986
ME SO HARD I CAME UP OFF THE

33:42.053 --> 33:45.223
GROUND.

33:45.289 --> 33:46.023
AND THEN ANOTHER SHERIFF'S

33:46.090 --> 33:47.692
DEPUTY HIT ME AND I GUESS THAT'S

33:47.759 --> 33:50.294
WHEN I PASSED OUT.

33:50.361 --> 33:52.830
I SAW ALL THAT HATRED THAT

33:52.897 --> 33:55.466
KILLED ALL THOSE PEOPLE AND

33:55.533 --> 33:56.934
THAT'S GONNA CONTINUE TO KILL
