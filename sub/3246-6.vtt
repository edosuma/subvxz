WEBVTT

00:03.420 --> 00:05.889
- What's happened?
- The time vortex. It's gone.

00:05.964 --> 00:07.807
Well, we've landed.
We've got to be somewhere.

00:07.883 --> 00:10.511
It's parallel, right? Like a parallel Earth
only they've got zeppelins?

00:10.594 --> 00:11.766
Am I right? I'm right, aren't I?

00:11.845 --> 00:13.939
A parallel world where
my dad's still alive.

00:14.056 --> 00:16.980
Rose, he's not your father
and she is not your mother.

00:17.059 --> 00:19.027
What's that? Mickey, we've got power!

00:19.102 --> 00:21.025
You're a fine businessman, John.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.822
But you're not God.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.821
What am I doing there?

00:24.942 --> 00:28.492
He doesn’t just look like me.
He is exactly the same.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.618
- What are they?
- Cybermen.

00:32.950 --> 00:33.997
Come on!

00:42.209 --> 00:45.133
There's no need to damage us.
We're good stock.

00:45.379 --> 00:49.509
We volunteer for the upgrade programme.
Take us to be processed.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.593
You are rogue elements.

00:51.677 --> 00:52.769
But we surrender.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.938
You are incompatible.

00:55.013 --> 00:56.435
But this is a surrender!

00:56.515 --> 00:58.609
You will be deleted.

00:58.976 --> 01:01.070
But we're surrendering!
Listen to me! We surrender!

01:01.144 --> 01:02.987
You are inferior.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.691
Man will be reborn as Cyberman

01:05.774 --> 01:09.824
but you will perish under maximum deletion.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.824
Delete. Delete. Delete.

01:58.201 --> 02:01.330
- What the hell was that?
- Or how about instead, run!

02:06.376 --> 02:08.049
Everybody in!

02:10.797 --> 02:14.677
- I've got to go back. My wife's in there.
- Anyone inside that house is dead.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.762
If you want to help,
then don't let her die for nothing.

02:16.845 --> 02:19.018
You've got to come with us right now.

02:19.097 --> 02:21.225
Come on, get a move on.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.060
Rose, she's not your mother.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.816
- I know.
- Come on.

02:26.313 --> 02:30.113
Finished chatting?
Never seen a slower getaway in my life!

02:48.543 --> 02:50.136
What was that thing?

02:50.212 --> 02:52.556
Little bit of technology from my home.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.008
It's stopped glowing. Has it run out?

02:54.091 --> 02:57.436
It's on a revitalising loop.
It'll charge back up in about four hours.

02:57.511 --> 03:00.264
- So we don't have a weapon anymore?
- Yeah, we've got weapons.

03:00.347 --> 03:03.647
Might not work on those metal things
but they're good enough for men like him.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.769
Leave him alone! What's he done wrong?

03:05.852 --> 03:08.105
Oh, you know, just laid a trap
that's wiped out the government

03:08.188 --> 03:09.690
and left Lumic in charge.

03:09.773 --> 03:12.572
If I was part of all that,
do you think I'd leave my wife inside?

03:12.651 --> 03:16.076
Maybe your plan went wrong. Still gives
us the right to execute you, though.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.156
Talk about executions,
you'll make me your enemy.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.375
And take some really good advice,
you don't want to do that.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.624
All the same, we have evidence
that says Pete Tyler's been working

03:23.704 --> 03:26.002
for the Lumic since 20.5.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.669
Is that true?

03:32.295 --> 03:33.797
Tell them, Mrs M.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.975
We've got a government mole
who feeds us information.

03:37.134 --> 03:40.980
Lumic's private files,
his South American operations, the lot.

03:41.096 --> 03:43.394
Secret broadcasts twice a week.

03:43.473 --> 03:46.147
- Broadcasts from Gemini?
- And how do you know that?

03:46.226 --> 03:47.603
I'm Gemini! That's me!

03:47.686 --> 03:52.283
- Yeah, well, you would say that.
- Encrypted wavelength 657, using binary 9.

03:53.150 --> 03:56.745
That's the only reason I was working
for Lumic, to get information.

03:56.820 --> 03:59.573
I thought I was broadcasting
to the security services. What do I get?

03:59.656 --> 04:02.956
Scooby Doo and his gang.
They've even got the van.

04:03.034 --> 04:05.162
No, no, but the Preachers
know what they're doing.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.997
Ricky said he's London's most wanted.

04:07.122 --> 04:08.999
Yeah, that's not exactly...

04:09.082 --> 04:10.709
Not exactly what?

04:11.168 --> 04:13.887
I'm London's most wanted
for parking tickets.

04:15.505 --> 04:16.552
Great.

04:16.630 --> 04:18.551
They were deliberate. I
was fighting the system.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.687
- Park anywhere, that's me.
- Good policy. I do much the same.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.727
I'm the Doctor by the way,
if anyone's interested.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.308
And I'm Rose. Hello.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.268
Even better. That's the name of my dog.

04:28.351 --> 04:31.525
Still, at least I've got the catering staff
on my side.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.361
I knew you weren't a traitor.

04:34.441 --> 04:35.909
Why's that, then?

04:38.028 --> 04:39.450
I just did.

04:41.156 --> 04:42.874
They took my wife.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.288
She might still be alive.

04:44.367 --> 04:48.747
That's even worse 'cause
that's what Lumic does.

04:48.872 --> 04:52.718
He takes the living
and he turns them into those machines.

04:53.376 --> 04:54.673
Cybermen.

04:55.504 --> 04:57.222
They're called Cybermen.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.050
And I'd take those Ear
Pods off if I were you.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.311
You never know, Lumic could be listening.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.684
But he's over-reached himself.
He's still just a businessman.

05:05.764 --> 05:07.107
He's assassinated the President.

05:07.182 --> 05:10.061
All we need to do is get to the city
and inform the authorities.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.646
Because I promise you, this ends tonight.

05:14.272 --> 05:19.153
My everlasting children.
Tell me, how does it feel?

05:19.236 --> 05:20.909
We feel nothing.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.661
But in your mind, what do you think?

05:23.740 --> 05:26.869
We think the same. We are uniform.

05:27.536 --> 05:30.130
But you think of what?

05:30.247 --> 05:34.753
We think of the humans. We think of
their difference and their pain.

05:34.918 --> 05:38.889
They suffer in the skin.
They must be upgraded.

05:38.964 --> 05:42.434
Excellent. Then let's begin.

05:42.592 --> 05:45.766
Computer, identify John Lumic.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.060
Voice prim' acknowledged

05:48.139 --> 05:50.983
Activate Ear Pod primary sequence.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.562
Please state area of activation.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.397
The city of London.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.450
I've just declared independence.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.740
Begin transmission.

06:22.966 --> 06:26.561
They will come to me. My new children.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.646
The immortal ones.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.057
The whole of London has been sealed off.

06:31.141 --> 06:34.270
There are reports of an army,
an army of metal men.

06:34.352 --> 06:38.653
All citizens should remove their Ear Pods.
I repeat; remove all Ear Pods.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.575
London has been placed under martial law.

06:40.650 --> 06:44.826
If you are hearing this, stay in your homes.
I repeat; stay in your homes.

06:48.867 --> 06:51.211
Oh, no, you don't.

06:52.078 --> 06:55.457
- What the hell?
- What's going on?

06:55.540 --> 06:58.009
It's the Ear Pods. Lumic's taken control.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.178
Can't we just, I don't know, take them off?

07:00.253 --> 07:03.723
Don't. It'll cause a brainstorm.

07:04.174 --> 07:08.020
The human race, for such an intelligent
lot, you aren't half susceptible.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.597
Give anyone a chance to take control
and you submit.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.274
Sometimes I think you like it. Easy life.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.648
Hey. Come and see.

07:22.067 --> 07:25.287
- Where are they all going?
- I don't know.

07:25.362 --> 07:27.160
Lumic must have a base of operations.

07:27.238 --> 07:31.084
Battersea. That's where he was
building his prototypes.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.623
Why's he doing it?

07:32.702 --> 07:34.204
He's dying.

07:34.329 --> 07:38.209
This all started out as a way of
prolonging life, keeping the brain alive.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.550
At any cost.

07:39.668 --> 07:42.091
Thing is, I've seen
Cybermen before, haven't I?

07:42.170 --> 07:44.923
The head, those handle shapes,
in Van Statten's Museum.

07:45.048 --> 07:47.050
Oh, there are Cybermen in our universe.

07:47.133 --> 07:50.888
They started on an ordinary world just
like this, then swarmed across the galaxy.

07:50.971 --> 07:54.011
This lot are a parallel version. They're
starting from scratch here on Earth.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.185
What the hell are you two on about?

07:56.267 --> 07:58.895
Never mind.
Come on, we need to get out of the city.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.027
Okay, split up. Mrs Moore,
you look after that lot.

08:01.106 --> 08:05.737
Jake, distract them, go right, I'll go left.
We'll meet back at Bridge Street. Move.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.238
I'm going with him.

08:09.072 --> 08:10.870
Come on. Let's go.

08:15.286 --> 08:16.583
Back!

08:30.885 --> 08:33.513
- Which way? I don't know where we are.
- Did they see us?

08:33.596 --> 08:35.347
- Do they know where we are?
- I bet they saw us.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.230
I bet they saw us in the dark.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.900
- They know where we are.
- They know where we are.

08:38.977 --> 08:42.948
I don't get it. What is it with you?
You are exactly like me.

08:43.188 --> 08:46.443
- I don't know. I reckon you're braver.
- Oh, yeah. Ten times.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.278
Still, your friends aren't
bad, I'll give you that.

08:48.403 --> 08:51.452
Oh, that's the Doctor and Rose.
I just tag along behind.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.667
Well, then you're not that bad.

08:53.783 --> 08:56.332
- Do you think?
- Yeah, suppose.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.299
Cybermen.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.635
- Split up!
- Split up!

09:39.829 --> 09:41.706
Go.

09:50.298 --> 09:54.599
Chamber 72 now closed for sterilisation.

09:55.345 --> 09:59.771
All reject stock will be incinerated.

10:18.576 --> 10:21.420
Come on! Come on!

10:22.205 --> 10:23.252
Come on!

10:25.125 --> 10:26.547
No!

10:43.852 --> 10:46.321
This one is un-programmed.

10:46.563 --> 10:49.737
Mr Crane, I thought you
were one of the faithful.

10:49.899 --> 10:53.574
Oh, that I am, sir.
My Ear Pod must have malfunctioned,

10:53.653 --> 10:55.496
for which I apologise.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.915
If I might?

11:01.452 --> 11:03.750
I'd like to request an upgrade, sir.

11:03.830 --> 11:07.425
I've seen the future
and it's copyright Cybus Industries.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.626
Sign me up

11:08.751 --> 11:10.503
A willing volunteer?

11:10.628 --> 11:12.722
You've known me a long time, sir.

11:12.797 --> 11:16.472
Quite a team, you and me.
I've been with you all the way.

11:16.926 --> 11:22.399
But believe me, sir, knowing you so
well, I know exactly what to do.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.101
No!

11:27.228 --> 11:29.777
No! Help me!

11:32.525 --> 11:33.947
Die, you...

11:35.653 --> 11:40.375
- Help me!
- You are in pain. We can remove pain forever.

11:40.450 --> 11:44.205
No. Not yet. I'm not ready.

11:44.287 --> 11:46.631
We will give you immortality.

11:46.748 --> 11:52.596
I've told you,
I will upgrade only with my last breath.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.798
Then breathe no more.

11:57.175 --> 12:00.805
No. No. I command you. No!

12:05.266 --> 12:08.645
I ran past the river, you should've seen it.
The whole city's on the march.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.151
Hundreds of Cybermen, all down the Thames.

12:12.607 --> 12:13.859
Here he is.

12:16.653 --> 12:19.998
- Which one are you?
- I'm sorry, the Cybermen, he couldn't...

12:20.073 --> 12:21.575
Are you Ricky?

12:22.158 --> 12:23.785
Are you Ricky?

12:23.868 --> 12:26.246
Mickey, that's you, isn't it?

12:26.371 --> 12:27.418
Yeah.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.842
He tried. He was running.
There was too many of them.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.590
Shut it.

12:36.673 --> 12:40.177
- There was nothing I could do.
- I said just shut it!

12:40.260 --> 12:42.433
Don't even talk about him.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.310
You're nothing, you are.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.060
Nothing.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.980
We can mourn him when London is safe.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.116
For now, we move on.

13:18.256 --> 13:19.883
The whole of London's been sealed off

13:19.966 --> 13:23.470
and the entire population's
been taken inside that place.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.851
To be converted.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.399
We've got to get in there and shut it down.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.728
- How do we do that?
- Oh, I'll think of something.

13:31.894 --> 13:35.398
- You're just making this up as you go along.
- Yep.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.358
But I do it brilliantly.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.956
That's a schematic
of the old factory.

13:43.031 --> 13:48.379
Look, cooling tunnels underneath the plant
big enough to walk through.

13:48.453 --> 13:51.002
We go under then up into
the control centre.

13:52.206 --> 13:55.301
There's another way in.
Through the front door.

13:55.376 --> 13:58.300
If they've taken Jackie for upgrading,
that's how she'll get in.

13:58.379 --> 14:00.677
We can't just go strolling up.

14:00.757 --> 14:04.307
Well, we could, with these.

14:04.844 --> 14:08.348
Fake Ear Pods. Dead, no signal.

14:08.598 --> 14:11.602
But put them on, the Cybermen
would mistake you for one of the crowd.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.148
Then that's my job.

14:13.227 --> 14:16.777
You'd have to show no emotion, none at all.
Any sign of emotion would give you away.

14:16.898 --> 14:19.492
- How many of those have you got?
- Just two sets.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.160
Okay.

14:21.277 --> 14:24.156
If that's the best way of finding Jackie,

14:24.280 --> 14:26.282
then I'm coming with you.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.789
- Why does she matter to you?
- We haven't got time.

14:28.910 --> 14:31.208
Doctor, I'm going with him and that's that.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.415
- No stopping you, is there?
- Nope.

14:34.791 --> 14:38.762
Tell you what, we can attack
the Ear Pods at the same time.

14:38.836 --> 14:42.761
Give people their minds back so they
don't walk into that place like sheep.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.308
Jakey-boy.

14:48.054 --> 14:51.558
Lumic's transmitting the control signal.
It must be from over there.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.938
There it is. On the zeppelin, do you see?

14:57.021 --> 14:58.898
Great big transmitter.

14:59.524 --> 15:03.074
Good thing Lumic likes showing off.
Reckon you can take it out?

15:03.152 --> 15:04.870
Consider it done.

15:05.988 --> 15:09.834
Mrs Moore, would you care to
accompany me into the cooling tunnels?

15:09.909 --> 15:12.537
How could I refuse an
offer of cooling tunnels?

15:12.620 --> 15:15.043
We attack on three sides.
Above, between, below.

15:15.123 --> 15:17.563
We get to the control centre,
we stop the conversion machines.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.426
What about me?

15:19.502 --> 15:22.597
Mickey, you can, um...

15:22.672 --> 15:25.425
What? Stay out of trouble? Be the tin dog?

15:25.842 --> 15:29.016
No, those days are over.
I'm going with Jake.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.644
- I don't need you, idiot.
- I'm not an idiot!

15:31.722 --> 15:35.226
You got that? I'm offering to help.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.730
Whatever.

15:41.649 --> 15:42.992
Mickey.

15:43.693 --> 15:45.536
Good luck.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.030
Yeah. You, too.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.953
- Rose, I'll see you later.
- Yeah, you'd better.

15:50.074 --> 15:53.078
If we survive this, I'll see
you back at the Tardis.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.500
That's a promise.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.515
Good luck.

16:23.024 --> 16:24.742
It's freezing.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.829
Any sign of a light switch?

16:27.904 --> 16:31.625
Can't see a thing. But I've got these.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.043
- A device for every occasion.
- Ooh.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.586
Put it on.

16:37.580 --> 16:40.754
Haven't got a hot dog in there, have you?
I'm starving.

16:40.875 --> 16:44.470
Of all the things to wish for.
That's mechanically recovered meat.

16:44.587 --> 16:47.932
I know. It's the Cyberman
of food, but it's tasty.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.431
A proper torch as well.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.639
Let's see where we are.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.978
Already converted, just put on ice.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.613
Come on.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.415
Let's go slowly.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.127
Keep an eye out for trip systems.

17:42.103 --> 17:46.609
Chamber 6 now open for human upgrading.

17:47.608 --> 17:52.239
Chamber 7 now open for human upgrading.

17:55.408 --> 17:59.288
Chamber 8 now open for human upgrading.

17:59.370 --> 18:02.499
Just put them on. Don't show any emotion.

18:02.707 --> 18:04.675
No signs, nothing, okay?

18:04.834 --> 18:07.007
Don't worry. We can do it.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.636
We could die in there.
Why are you doing this?

18:10.715 --> 18:13.138
Let's just say I'm doing
it for my mum and dad.

18:14.176 --> 18:15.894
Right, let's go.

18:17.847 --> 18:22.444
Chamber 8 now open for human upgrading.

18:23.102 --> 18:28.324
Chamber 9 now open for human upgrading.

18:28.691 --> 18:33.413
Chamber 10 now open for human upgrading.

18:38.367 --> 18:43.589
Chamber 11 now open for human upgrading.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.618
Two guards. We can take them.

19:20.743 --> 19:23.917
- Don't kill them.
- Who put you in charge?

19:24.080 --> 19:27.880
If you kill them, what's the difference
between you and a Cyberman?

19:28.918 --> 19:30.966
Well, I suppose we could use these.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.598
Smelling salts?

19:34.674 --> 19:37.894
Bit stronger than that.
One of Mrs Moore's little tricks.

19:37.968 --> 19:39.936
Should knock them out.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.390
Three, two, one.

19:56.904 --> 19:59.077
There's gotta be more guards on board.

20:00.116 --> 20:02.118
Then let's go get them.

20:06.956 --> 20:11.132
How did you get into this, then?
Rattling along with the Preachers?

20:12.128 --> 20:14.256
Oh, I used to be ordinary.

20:15.631 --> 20:18.851
Worked at Cybus Industries, 9-to-5.

20:18.926 --> 20:22.521
Until one day,
I find something I'm not supposed to.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.895
A file on the mainframe.

20:25.808 --> 20:27.651
All I did was read it.

20:28.477 --> 20:32.698
Then suddenly, I've got men with guns
knocking in the middle of the night.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.197
A life on the run.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.154
Then I found the Preachers.

20:38.738 --> 20:43.835
They needed a techie, so I just sat down
and taught myself everything.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.003
What about Mr Moore?

20:46.162 --> 20:48.256
Well, he's not called Moore.

20:49.623 --> 20:51.671
I got that from a book.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.094
Mrs Moore.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.514
It's safer not to use real names.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.058
But he thinks I'm dead.

21:00.843 --> 21:03.187
It was the only way to keep him safe.

21:03.304 --> 21:04.681
Him and the kids.

21:06.849 --> 21:10.228
What about you? Got any family or...

21:10.394 --> 21:14.399
Oh, who needs family?
I've got the whole world on my shoulders.

21:15.149 --> 21:16.901
Go on, then.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.702
What's your real name?

21:19.320 --> 21:21.197
Angela Price.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.749
Don't tell a soul.

21:24.492 --> 21:25.869
Not a word.

21:38.339 --> 21:40.762
Movement in Deepcold 6.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.598
A waken the army.

21:46.555 --> 21:48.899
Doctor, did that one just move?

21:49.683 --> 21:51.731
It's just the torchlight.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.399
Keep going, come on.

21:53.896 --> 21:55.648
They're waking up. Run!

22:08.410 --> 22:12.335
Get up! Quick! They're coming!

22:13.123 --> 22:15.251
Open it! Open it!

22:16.252 --> 22:19.256
Get up! Quick, quick!

22:19.880 --> 22:21.257
Come on!

22:28.764 --> 22:30.858
Oh, good team, Mrs Moore.

22:34.603 --> 22:38.779
Units upgraded now 6,500.

22:38.858 --> 22:43.489
Repeat, 6,500 and rising.

22:50.119 --> 22:51.666
You will wait.

22:54.123 --> 22:55.466
You Okay?

22:56.625 --> 22:57.751
No.

22:57.835 --> 23:02.306
Chamber 6 now open
for human upgrading.

23:04.133 --> 23:08.980
All reject stock will be incinerated.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.180
Any Sign of Jackie?

23:50.721 --> 23:55.352
You are Peter Tyler. Confirm.
You are Peter Tyler.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.527
Confirm.

23:57.603 --> 24:02.700
I recognise you. I went first.
My name was Jacqueline Tyler.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.197
- No.
- What?

24:04.318 --> 24:06.696
They are un-programmed, restrain.

24:06.779 --> 24:10.079
You're lying, you're not her.
You're not my Jackie.

24:10.199 --> 24:14.921
Now I am Cyberform. Once
I was Jacqueline Tyler.

24:15.371 --> 24:18.625
But you can't be. Not her.

24:18.707 --> 24:21.460
Her brain is inside this body.

24:21.543 --> 24:23.466
Jacks, I came to save you.

24:23.545 --> 24:27.971
This man worked with Cybus Industries
to create our species.

24:28.050 --> 24:33.102
He will be rewarded by force.
Take them to Cyber Control.

24:36.558 --> 24:39.607
They killed her. They
took her and killed her.

24:39.687 --> 24:42.736
Maybe there's a chance, I don't know.
Maybe we can reverse it.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.442
There's nothing we can do.

24:44.525 --> 24:46.698
But if she remembers...

24:49.029 --> 24:52.499
Where is she? Which one was it?
Which one was her?

24:54.243 --> 24:56.166
They all look the same.

25:00.457 --> 25:04.087
Nice one, nobody's home.
Find the transmitter controls.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.796
- What do they look like?
- I don't know.

25:05.879 --> 25:10.225
They might have "transmitter controls"
written in big red letters.just look.

25:16.807 --> 25:18.275
Cyberman!

25:37.161 --> 25:38.538
It's dead.

25:40.122 --> 25:42.216
I don't think it was ever alive.

25:46.837 --> 25:50.307
It's empty, no brain. It's just a robot suit.
It's for display.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.139
Okay.

25:53.927 --> 25:55.179
Transmitter.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.653
You are not upgraded.

26:06.732 --> 26:09.611
Yeah, well, upgrade this.

26:17.826 --> 26:21.171
- What the hell was that thing?
- Electromagnetic bomb.

26:22.081 --> 26:25.176
Takes out computers.
I figured it might stop a Cyber suit.

26:25.292 --> 26:29.513
Well, you figured right.
Now, let's have a look. Know your enemy.

26:29.588 --> 26:32.307
Got a logo on the front.

26:33.050 --> 26:35.018
Lumic's turned them into a brand.

26:38.013 --> 26:39.515
Heart of steel.

26:42.392 --> 26:43.609
But look.

26:46.355 --> 26:48.858
- Is that flesh?
- Hmm.

26:49.691 --> 26:51.443
A central nervous system.

26:51.568 --> 26:55.118
Artificially grown then threaded throughout
the suit so it responds like a living thing.

26:55.197 --> 26:57.916
Well, it is a living thing.

26:58.033 --> 27:00.377
Oh, but look.

27:01.829 --> 27:05.925
Emotional inhibitor. Stops
them feeling anything.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.543
But Why?

27:08.210 --> 27:12.431
It's still got a human brain. Imagine
its reaction if it could see itself.

27:12.548 --> 27:14.721
Realise itself inside this thing.

27:15.551 --> 27:17.394
It would go insane.

27:18.554 --> 27:21.979
So they cut out the one thing
that makes them human.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.855
Because they have to.

27:23.934 --> 27:27.029
Why am I cold?

27:27.104 --> 27:29.072
Oh, my God, it's alive.

27:29.815 --> 27:34.116
- It can feel.
- We broke the inhibitor. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

27:34.194 --> 27:36.538
Why so cold?

27:36.613 --> 27:38.286
Can you remember your name?

27:38.365 --> 27:41.744
Sally. Sally Phelan.

27:42.244 --> 27:43.541
You're a woman.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.543
Where's Gareth?

27:46.415 --> 27:47.758
Who's Gareth?

27:47.833 --> 27:49.676
He can't see me.

27:49.918 --> 27:53.718
It's unlucky the night before.

27:54.923 --> 27:56.391
You're getting married?

27:56.466 --> 28:00.892
I'm cold. I'm so cold.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.687
It's all right.

28:04.766 --> 28:07.861
You sleep now, Sally. just go to sleep.

28:12.608 --> 28:15.236
Sally Phelan didn't die for nothing.

28:15.861 --> 28:19.582
'Cause that's the key,
the emotional inhibitor.

28:19.656 --> 28:22.125
If we could find the code behind it,
the cancellation code,

28:22.201 --> 28:24.920
then feed it throughout the system
into every Cyberman's head,

28:24.995 --> 28:27.168
they'd realise what they are.

28:27.247 --> 28:28.965
And what happens then?

28:29.625 --> 28:31.468
I think it would kill them.

28:33.503 --> 28:36.632
- Can we do that?
- We've got to.

28:36.715 --> 28:39.594
Before they kill everyone else.

28:39.676 --> 28:42.270
There's no choice, Doctor.

28:42.346 --> 28:44.269
It's got to be done.

28:51.647 --> 28:54.617
No! No! You didn't have to kill her!

28:54.691 --> 28:57.991
Sensors detect a binary vascular system.

28:58.070 --> 29:03.292
You are an unknown upgrade.
You will be taken for analysis.

29:12.167 --> 29:15.967
The transmitter controls are sealed behind here.
We need oxyacetylene or something.

29:16.046 --> 29:17.844
Oh, and I forgot to bring it with me.

29:17.923 --> 29:20.301
- Then what do we do?
- We'll crash the zeppelin.

29:20.384 --> 29:24.139
- With us inside it?
- We could set it on automatic and then just leg it.

29:24.221 --> 29:25.689
Let's have a look.

29:31.353 --> 29:34.698
It's locked. There's got to be an override.

29:34.773 --> 29:37.777
Let me have a go.
I'm good with computers. Trust me.

29:58.171 --> 30:00.970
I've been captured but don't worry,
Rose and Pete are still out there.

30:01.049 --> 30:04.349
They can rescue me.
Oh, well, never mind. You okay?

30:04.428 --> 30:05.645
Yeah.

30:06.888 --> 30:08.185
But they got Jackie.

30:08.265 --> 30:10.643
We were too late. Lumic killed her.

30:10.726 --> 30:13.980
And where is he? The famous Mr Lumic?

30:14.521 --> 30:16.944
Don't we get the chance to meet
our lord and master?

30:17.024 --> 30:19.072
He has been upgraded.

30:19.943 --> 30:22.913
- So he’s just like you?
- He is superior.

30:22.988 --> 30:27.539
The Lumic unit has been designated
Cyber controller.

30:37.210 --> 30:42.091
This is the Age of Steel
and I am its creator.

30:47.596 --> 30:49.189
I'm almost there.

30:50.098 --> 30:51.645
Not bad work.

30:57.356 --> 30:58.949
It's moving!

31:00.150 --> 31:01.652
You said it was dead!

31:01.735 --> 31:04.329
A robot suit's still a good robot.
Wait a minute.

31:04.404 --> 31:06.077
Hey, Cyberman. Over here.

31:07.991 --> 31:10.619
Come on, you brainless lump of metal.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.579
Come and have a go.

31:23.799 --> 31:24.971
Oh, no!

31:28.261 --> 31:30.184
The transmitter is down!

31:41.233 --> 31:44.362
That's my friends at work. Good boys.

31:44.986 --> 31:47.739
Mr Lumic, I think that's
a vote for free will.

31:47.823 --> 31:52.329
I have factories waiting
on seven continents.

31:52.661 --> 31:54.914
If the Ear Pods have failed,

31:54.996 --> 31:59.342
then the Cybermen will
take humanity by force.

32:00.335 --> 32:04.556
London has fallen, so shall the world.

32:05.507 --> 32:08.306
Hold on, I've logged on to Cyber Control.
They're alive.

32:08.385 --> 32:10.433
The Doctor and Rose. There they are.

32:10.512 --> 32:15.393
- Never mind them, what the hell is that thing?
- Shh! Has this thing got sound?

32:15.475 --> 32:18.570
I will bring peace to the world.

32:18.645 --> 32:20.818
Everlasting peace

32:20.897 --> 32:23.992
and unity and uniformity.

32:24.526 --> 32:28.372
And imagination? What about that?
The one thing that led you here.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.745
Imagination, you're killing it dead.

32:31.408 --> 32:33.911
- What' is your name?
- I'm the Doctor.

32:33.994 --> 32:37.464
A redundant title. Doctors need not exist.

32:37.539 --> 32:39.337
Cybermen never sicken.

32:39.416 --> 32:42.795
Yeah, but that's it.
That's exactly the point.

32:43.128 --> 32:48.134
Oh, Lumic, you're a clever man. I'd call
you a genius except I'm in the room.

32:48.216 --> 32:50.719
But everything you've invented,
you did to fight your sickness,

32:50.802 --> 32:53.601
and that's brilliant, that is so human.

32:54.306 --> 32:56.775
But once you get rid of
sickness and mortality,

32:56.850 --> 32:59.103
then what's there to strive for, eh?

32:59.769 --> 33:01.362
The Cybermen won't advance.

33:01.438 --> 33:03.315
You'll just stop.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.150
You'll stay like this forever.

33:05.233 --> 33:09.613
A metal Earth with metal
men and metal thoughts,

33:09.696 --> 33:14.076
lacking the one thing
that makes this planet so alive. People!

33:14.618 --> 33:17.588
Ordinary, stupid, brilliant people.

33:17.662 --> 33:20.962
You are proud of your emotions?

33:21.041 --> 33:22.418
Oh, yes.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.048
Then tell me, Doctor,

33:24.127 --> 33:28.303
have you known grief and rage and pain?

33:28.715 --> 33:30.592
Yes. Yes, I have.

33:30.884 --> 33:32.557
And they hurt?

33:32.636 --> 33:34.104
Oh, yes.

33:34.429 --> 33:38.150
I can set you free. Would
you not want that?

33:38.225 --> 33:40.603
A life without pain?

33:40.769 --> 33:42.521
You might as well kill me.

33:42.604 --> 33:45.403
Then I take that option.

33:45.482 --> 33:47.450
It's not yours to take.

33:47.526 --> 33:48.948
You're a Cyber controller.

33:49.027 --> 33:52.122
You don't control me
or anything with blood in its heart.

33:52.197 --> 33:54.825
You have no means of stopping me.

33:54.908 --> 33:58.583
I have an army. A species of my own.

33:59.371 --> 34:03.126
You just don't get it, do you?
An army's nothing.

34:03.667 --> 34:08.467
'Cause those ordinary people, they're the key.
The most ordinary person can change the world.

34:08.630 --> 34:12.385
Some ordinary man or woman, some idiot.

34:12.509 --> 34:15.638
All it takes is for him to find,
say, the right numbers,

34:15.719 --> 34:20.396
say, the right code, say, for example,
the code behind the emotional inhibitor.

34:20.475 --> 34:21.976
The code right in front of him.

34:22.060 --> 34:25.610
'Cause even an idiot knows his computers
these days.

34:25.688 --> 34:29.489
Knows how to get past
firewalls and passwords.

34:29.568 --> 34:32.742
Knows how to find something encrypted
in the Lumic family database under,

34:32.821 --> 34:35.665
- what was it, Pete? Binary what?
- Binary 9.

34:35.782 --> 34:40.504
- Binary 9.
- An idiot could find that code. A cancellation code.

34:40.620 --> 34:44.123
And he'd keep on typing, keep on fighting,

34:44.206 --> 34:46.460
anything to save his friends.

34:46.543 --> 34:48.670
Your words are irrelevant.

34:49.462 --> 34:51.179
Talk too much, that's my problem.

34:51.255 --> 34:55.726
Lucky I got you that cheap tariff, Rose,
for all our long chats on your phone.

34:55.802 --> 34:56.974
The phone.

34:57.053 --> 34:58.771
You will be deleted.

34:58.847 --> 35:02.147
Yes. Delete. Control. Hash.
All those lovely buttons.

35:02.225 --> 35:04.648
Then, of course, my
particular favourite. Send.

35:04.728 --> 35:08.904
And let's not forget how you seduced all
those ordinary people in the first place,

35:08.982 --> 35:11.656
by making every bit of technology
compatible with everything else.

35:11.735 --> 35:12.987
It's for you.

35:13.612 --> 35:14.784
Like this.

35:25.248 --> 35:26.545
Yes!

35:38.470 --> 35:40.063
I'm sorry.

35:48.355 --> 35:50.232
What have you done?

35:50.315 --> 35:52.738
I gave them back their souls.

35:52.817 --> 35:56.162
They can see what you've done, Lumic,
and it's killing them.

35:56.237 --> 35:58.035
Delete! Delete!

35:59.074 --> 36:00.075
Delete!

36:16.049 --> 36:17.266
There's no way out.

36:18.385 --> 36:20.103
- What are you doing?
- We've got to get away.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.351
If that factory blows up,
this balloon's gonna ignite.

36:22.430 --> 36:24.307
- Take it back!
- Mickey, they've had it.

36:24.432 --> 36:26.560
I said take it back!

36:28.895 --> 36:31.318
We're not leaving them behind.

36:31.398 --> 36:33.947
There's no way we're leaving them behind.

36:41.449 --> 36:42.701
Hold it.

36:44.411 --> 36:47.164
Rose? Rose, can you hear me?
Head for the roof.

36:47.247 --> 36:49.750
It's Mickey. He says head for the roof.

37:07.851 --> 37:08.351
No!

37:22.031 --> 37:24.705
Mickey, where did you
learn to fly that thing?

37:24.784 --> 37:28.288
PlayStation. Just hold on, Rose.
I'm coming to get you.

37:37.839 --> 37:40.342
- You can't go any lower.
- I've got to, man.

37:40.425 --> 37:42.803
You're gonna crush them.

37:42.886 --> 37:45.639
There's gotta be something,
there's got to be.

37:45.847 --> 37:47.144
Oh, yes.

37:51.811 --> 37:53.529
You've got to be kidding.

37:53.605 --> 37:55.607
Rose, get on!

37:58.860 --> 38:01.033
Hold on tight, we're going up.

38:02.113 --> 38:05.287
Welcome to Mickey Smith Airlines.
Please enjoy your flight.

38:14.375 --> 38:16.719
We did it! Mickey did it!

38:40.902 --> 38:43.746
Pete! Take this!

38:45.406 --> 38:46.658
Use it!

38:46.950 --> 38:51.000
Hold the button down.
Press it against the rope. just do it!

38:53.581 --> 38:57.427
Jackie Tyler. This is for her.

39:54.017 --> 39:56.065
So what happens inside that thing, then?

39:56.144 --> 39:57.771
Do you want to see?

39:57.854 --> 39:59.481
I don't think so.

40:01.232 --> 40:06.705
But you two, you know, all that stuff
you said about different worlds.

40:08.615 --> 40:09.958
Who are you?

40:12.160 --> 40:14.583
It's like you said.

40:14.662 --> 40:17.791
Imagine there are different worlds.

40:18.833 --> 40:20.426
Parallel worlds.

40:20.501 --> 40:23.801
Worlds with another Pete Tyler

40:25.214 --> 40:27.683
and Jackie Tyler is still alive.

40:27.842 --> 40:29.810
And their daughter.

40:33.348 --> 40:35.726
- I've got to go.
- But if you just look inside...

40:35.808 --> 40:41.440
I can't. There's all those Lumic factories out
there, all those Cybermen still in storage.

40:41.522 --> 40:43.775
Someone's got to tell the authorities
what happened.

40:43.858 --> 40:45.701
Carry on the fight.

40:47.028 --> 40:48.405
Rose.

40:48.821 --> 40:51.074
I've only got five minutes of power.

40:51.366 --> 40:53.366
- We've got to go.
- The Doctor could show you how.

40:53.368 --> 40:55.496
Thank you for everything.

40:57.205 --> 40:58.422
Dad...

41:00.708 --> 41:02.676
Don't. just don't.

41:18.768 --> 41:20.270
Here it is.

41:21.688 --> 41:24.407
I found it. Not a crease.

41:24.565 --> 41:27.569
My suit. Good man.

41:27.902 --> 41:30.746
Now then, Jake, we've got to run,
but one more thing.

41:30.822 --> 41:34.201
Mrs Moore, her real name was Angela Price.

41:34.617 --> 41:38.292
She's got a husband out there and children.
Find them.

41:38.371 --> 41:40.999
Tell them how she died saving the world.

41:41.082 --> 41:42.925
Yeah, course I will.

41:43.001 --> 41:44.378
Off we go, then.

41:44.460 --> 41:46.212
Erm...

41:46.295 --> 41:48.138
Thing is, I'm staying.

41:48.631 --> 41:51.134
You're doing what?

41:51.217 --> 41:52.639
You can't.

41:52.760 --> 41:56.765
It sort of balances out 'cause this
world lost its Ricky, but there's me.

41:57.223 --> 42:00.898
And there's work to be done
with all those Cybermen still out there.

42:00.977 --> 42:02.900
But you can't stay.

42:04.147 --> 42:06.115
Rose, my gran's here.

42:07.650 --> 42:09.948
She's still alive. My
old gran, remember her?

42:10.028 --> 42:11.120
Yeah.

42:11.237 --> 42:12.739
She needs me.

42:13.781 --> 42:16.330
What about me? What if I need you?

42:17.201 --> 42:19.420
Yeah, but Rose, you don't.

42:21.164 --> 42:23.258
It's just you and him, isn't it?

42:25.543 --> 42:29.798
We had something a long time ago,
but not anymore.

42:31.340 --> 42:33.434
Well, we'll come back.

42:33.509 --> 42:36.058
We can travel anywhere.
Come and see you, yeah?

42:36.137 --> 42:37.434
We can't.

42:39.807 --> 42:43.152
I told you, travel between parallel worlds
is impossible.

42:43.811 --> 42:45.188
We only got here by accident.

42:45.271 --> 42:49.401
We fell through a crack in time.
When we leave, I've got to close it.

42:51.861 --> 42:53.613
We can't ever return.

43:00.161 --> 43:01.378
Doctor.

43:02.830 --> 43:06.004
Take Rose's phone. It's got the code.
Get it out there.

43:06.667 --> 43:08.669
Stop those factories.

43:11.214 --> 43:12.340
Good luck.

43:14.342 --> 43:15.764
Mickey the idiot.

43:15.843 --> 43:17.186
Watch it.

43:31.234 --> 43:32.451
Thanks.

43:34.570 --> 43:37.164
We've had a laugh, though, haven't we?

43:37.240 --> 43:39.618
Seen it all, been there and back.

43:42.453 --> 43:44.581
Who'd have thought, me and you,
off that old estate,

43:44.664 --> 43:46.587
flying through the stars.

43:46.707 --> 43:49.426
All those years, just sitting there...

43:50.837 --> 43:52.931
imagining what we'd do one day.

43:55.091 --> 43:57.219
We never saw this, did we?

44:05.393 --> 44:07.395
Go on. Don't miss your flight.

44:34.755 --> 44:36.678
Jake, you want to watch this.

44:42.305 --> 44:44.182
What the hell?

44:44.348 --> 44:47.318
That's the Doctor in the Tardis.

44:48.269 --> 44:49.646
With Rose Tyler.

45:04.785 --> 45:09.131
You're alive. Oh, Mum, you're alive.

45:09.749 --> 45:12.127
Well, I was the last time I looked.

45:12.585 --> 45:14.883
What is it? What's happened, sweetheart?

45:14.962 --> 45:16.839
What's wrong? Where did you go?

45:16.964 --> 45:18.591
Far away.

45:19.467 --> 45:22.141
That was far away.

45:22.511 --> 45:23.808
Where's Mickey?

45:23.888 --> 45:25.265
He's gone home.

45:38.778 --> 45:42.078
I know it's not easy
with my face looking exactly like Ricky,

45:42.156 --> 45:45.035
but I'm a different man,
I'm not replacing him.

45:45.117 --> 45:48.417
But we can remember him
by fighting in his name.

45:49.997 --> 45:54.093
With all those cyber factories out there,
do you think there'd be one in Paris?

45:54.168 --> 45:56.762
- Yeah.
- Then let's go and liberate Paris.

45:56.837 --> 45:59.340
What, you and me? In a van?

46:00.383 --> 46:02.385
There's nothing wrong with a van.

46:02.468 --> 46:05.597
I once saved the universe
with a big yellow truck.

46:26.909 --> 46:30.334
There you go, sir.
All wired up for the great occasion.

46:30.788 --> 46:32.711
Someone help me, please!

46:32.832 --> 46:36.086
It's happening all over the place.
They're turning into monsters.

46:40.673 --> 46:43.347
Ordinary people
are being struck down and changed

46:43.426 --> 46:46.145
and the only new thing in the house
is a television.

46:46.554 --> 46:52.061
Men in black? Vanishing police cars? This is
Churchill's England, not Stalin's Russia.

46:52.143 --> 46:54.271
Are you sitting comfortably?

46:54.395 --> 46:55.897
Good.

46:55.980 --> 46:57.732
Then We'll begin.
