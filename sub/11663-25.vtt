01:18.433 --> 01:20.100
You know, Rose,
I'm really enjoying this,

01:20.166 --> 01:22.700
you and I having a quiet
cup of coffee together.

01:25.633 --> 01:28.467
-Me too, because, you know--
-I said quiet.

01:32.967 --> 01:35.567
Girls, you will never believe
what happened to me

01:35.633 --> 01:37.633
at the supermarket yesterday.

01:37.700 --> 01:41.633
You were in a real hurry and needed
to go through the express lane,

01:41.700 --> 01:44.667
but you had 25 items, so you
went through three times,

01:44.734 --> 01:49.867
once with 10 items, once with
9 items, and once with 6 items.

01:52.166 --> 01:56.200
No, Rose. What kind
of a moron would do that?

02:03.066 --> 02:05.867
This man at the
produce counter

02:05.934 --> 02:08.000
asked me to play tennis
with him tonight,

02:08.066 --> 02:10.400
but I forgot that big daddy's
baby brother,

02:10.467 --> 02:14.467
my dearest and nearest relative,
is flying in at 7.

02:14.533 --> 02:17.500
This is such a dilemma.
Whatever am I going to do?

02:17.567 --> 02:20.033
It doesn't sound
like a dilemma at all.

02:20.100 --> 02:21.567
You know, you're right.

02:21.633 --> 02:22.934
Family you can see any time,

02:23.000 --> 02:25.734
but a one-night stand
only happens one night.

02:29.967 --> 02:34.300
Now I have to get me somebody
to dump uncle Lucas on.

02:34.367 --> 02:36.467
If I could only find me an...

02:39.467 --> 02:43.400
Rose, sweetheart,
what are you doing tonight?

02:43.467 --> 02:46.633
Blanche, I can't believe you.

02:47.700 --> 02:49.533
Where do you get your nerve?

02:49.600 --> 02:52.400
Ironically, from uncle Lucas.

02:52.900 --> 02:54.834
Sophia.

02:54.900 --> 02:57.700
You come to me, a matriarch,
the head of a family?

02:57.767 --> 03:00.300
To me, Blanche,
family is everything.

03:00.367 --> 03:02.533
There's nothing higher
than family.

03:02.600 --> 03:05.767
Family I will always,
without exception, stand up for.

03:05.834 --> 03:07.600
But, honey, I'm desperate.

03:07.667 --> 03:09.200
Con Dorothy into it.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.433
Conning Dorothy is a thought,

03:13.500 --> 03:17.967
but I don't know if I have it in me
to do all the persuading and...

03:18.033 --> 03:20.433
Oh, my God! Is that Dorothy?

03:22.300 --> 03:26.667
Or miss Lana Turner emerging
from her morning toilette?

03:29.066 --> 03:32.533
It's Lana
with a message from Dorothy.

03:32.600 --> 03:35.100
Whatever the favor is, forget it.

03:36.934 --> 03:39.467
Dorothy Zbornak,
have I got a man for you.

03:39.533 --> 03:41.567
No, thanks. Had one.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.200
It's my uncle Lucas.

03:47.266 --> 03:51.800
He's perfect, all man,
all heart, all yours.

03:51.867 --> 03:53.233
Blanche, forget it!

03:53.300 --> 03:55.033
It's not going to work out.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.667
He's a little bit country,

03:56.734 --> 04:00.233
and I'm a little bit
too smart for this.

04:00.300 --> 04:01.600
You've got uncle Lucas all wrong.

04:01.667 --> 04:03.700
He's a man of cultivation
and high taste.

04:03.767 --> 04:08.200
Yes. He wipes the jug on his sleeve
before he passes it.

04:13.033 --> 04:16.500
Oh, Dorothy. Now, please.
I told him all about you.

04:16.567 --> 04:18.400
He's dying to meet you.

04:18.467 --> 04:21.834
If you ask me, Blanche, your uncle
Lucas is nothing but lonely,

04:21.900 --> 04:24.400
desperate, pathetic, and lonely.

04:24.467 --> 04:25.300
Right.

04:25.367 --> 04:28.734
Hey, Dorothy,
you two might just hit it off.

04:32.867 --> 04:35.200
He's nothing of the sort.

04:35.266 --> 04:36.900
He's excited about this date

04:36.967 --> 04:39.333
because I gave him
a full description of you.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.500
Well, I can understand that.

04:41.567 --> 04:44.300
I mean, women like me
don't grow on trees.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.834
Too bad.
We could use the shade.

04:54.800 --> 04:58.867
Aw, Dorothy...
it's only one night.

04:58.934 --> 05:02.000
-Please?
-Oh...

05:02.066 --> 05:04.667
Ma, do you mind
if we move scrabble to Sunday?

05:04.734 --> 05:06.000
I'll live.

05:06.066 --> 05:08.166
There's no need to be sarcastic.

05:08.233 --> 05:10.967
I mean it. I'm finally
going to go out and live.

05:13.200 --> 05:17.233
(mellow music playing)

05:30.867 --> 05:32.400
So...

05:35.867 --> 05:38.266
you're a English teacher?

05:38.767 --> 05:39.834
Oh.

05:42.667 --> 05:44.667
Yes. Yes, I am.

05:46.333 --> 05:47.567
You...

05:48.667 --> 05:52.033
-own seven hardware stores?
-Yeah. Yep, I do.

05:55.700 --> 05:58.200
So...

06:01.834 --> 06:03.233
would you like
some more beer?

06:03.300 --> 06:05.834
Oh. No, thanks. I'm fine.

06:05.900 --> 06:07.533
What am I saying?

06:07.600 --> 06:11.233
I am not fine.
Look, Lucas, this isn't your fault.

06:11.300 --> 06:14.533
I do not go out on blind dates.

06:14.600 --> 06:19.734
I mean, this is as silly
as I have felt in a long, long time.

06:27.934 --> 06:29.533
Until now.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.767
Wait till he brings the pants.

06:36.300 --> 06:38.333
You're joking.

06:38.400 --> 06:39.767
Somebody's got to.

06:41.667 --> 06:45.867
Look, Lucas, can I be 100% frank?
We're both adults.

06:55.400 --> 06:58.633
Look, I only came
as a favor to Blanche.

06:58.700 --> 07:02.133
When she told me how badly
you were dying to meet me--

07:02.200 --> 07:06.000
Blanche told you
I was dying to meet you?

07:06.066 --> 07:07.467
The only reason I came was

07:07.533 --> 07:11.200
because she said you were a
lonely single gal dying to meet me.

07:11.266 --> 07:12.200
She didn't!

07:12.266 --> 07:14.667
Yes, she did.

07:15.867 --> 07:17.734
What do you think this means?

07:17.800 --> 07:22.400
I think it means that she is shacked
up in some cheap motel...

07:23.300 --> 07:25.734
I mean, she has a date.

07:32.633 --> 07:35.567
Oh, Lucas, what a relief.

07:35.633 --> 07:37.734
So you didn't even want
to go out with me.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.567
Not a chance.

07:42.834 --> 07:45.400
And you never wanted
to go out with me.

07:45.467 --> 07:47.867
Oh, come on. Get serious.

07:49.633 --> 07:51.266
You realize, of course,

07:51.333 --> 07:53.066
that we can't let Blanche
get away with this.

07:53.133 --> 07:56.467
-She must be punished.
-No argument here.

07:56.533 --> 07:58.400
What do you have in mind?

07:58.467 --> 08:01.600
Well, she's jerked us around.
Let's jerk her right back.

08:01.667 --> 08:03.734
Let's see.

08:03.800 --> 08:07.867
Why don't we make her think that
you and I are going to get married?

08:07.934 --> 08:09.033
Married?

08:09.100 --> 08:10.967
You and I?

08:11.033 --> 08:15.266
Oh, I have to admit,
there's a certain genius to it.

08:15.333 --> 08:20.333
Are you kidding, a Brooklyn Italian
living in Hollingsworth Manor?

08:20.400 --> 08:23.033
How did you know
I was a Brooklyn Italian?

08:23.100 --> 08:25.433
That's how Blanche refers to you
in her letters.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.266
Yes, she must be punished.

08:32.800 --> 08:34.867
Dorothy,
I believe this is the beginning

08:34.934 --> 08:38.033
of a long and beautiful friendship.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.700
To revenge.

08:46.700 --> 08:49.867
Oh, look at this one,
scrunched-up little frown,

08:49.934 --> 08:51.967
kind of reminds me of my mother.

08:59.533 --> 09:03.934
(soft music playing)

09:04.000 --> 09:06.600
<i>♪ Good morning ♪</i>

09:07.800 --> 09:09.700
How was your date?

09:09.767 --> 09:11.433
-Did you have a good time?
-Oh, Blanche,

09:11.500 --> 09:14.767
I can't thank you enough.
I had a fantastic time.

09:14.834 --> 09:17.266
Well, now, didn't I tell you?

09:17.333 --> 09:19.000
Go on now.
Don't leave anything out.

09:19.066 --> 09:24.467
Well, he was so thoughtful
and considerate, affectionate.

09:24.533 --> 09:25.600
With whom?

09:26.900 --> 09:29.367
With me!

09:29.433 --> 09:31.200
No. I had the time
of my life last night,

09:31.266 --> 09:36.400
and even if he never calls again,
at least we'll always have

09:36.467 --> 09:38.934
Don's Crab house.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.433
(doorbell rings)

09:41.500 --> 09:44.667
Ingrid Bergman had Paris.
My pussycat has crabs.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.967
Oh, girls, would you look
at what uncle Lucas

09:59.033 --> 10:01.567
has brought his favorite niece.

10:03.767 --> 10:06.533
Dorothy, I didn't mean to
intrude without calling,

10:06.600 --> 10:08.533
but I didn't sleep
for thinking about you.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.734
Oh, no intrusion.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.934
I was afraid that
I'd never see you again.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.867
Never see me again?

10:14.934 --> 10:18.600
I'd buy a julep for general Grant's
ghost before I'd let that happen.

10:18.667 --> 10:21.900
Oh. I was hoping you'd say that.

10:25.133 --> 10:26.233
Dorothy...

10:28.033 --> 10:30.767
Dorothy, I know it sounds impetuous.

10:30.834 --> 10:33.200
I know we just met, but I'm
at that stage in my life

10:33.266 --> 10:34.467
where I can't afford to waste time.

10:34.533 --> 10:40.100
Dorothy, I love you,
and I want to know.

10:40.166 --> 10:42.100
Will you...

10:42.166 --> 10:44.400
I think he's going
to ask her out again.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.100
Dorothy...

10:58.734 --> 11:00.100
yes?

11:00.166 --> 11:02.567
Dorothy, will you marry me?

11:02.633 --> 11:06.033
Oh, Lucas!
Oh, yes!

11:06.100 --> 11:10.033
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

11:10.100 --> 11:14.367
No! No! No! No! No!

11:14.867 --> 11:16.567
No!

11:16.633 --> 11:20.300
What in hell is wrong with you two?

11:20.367 --> 11:23.367
But you just...
I don't know what to say.

11:23.433 --> 11:24.734
Well, whatever you decide,

11:24.800 --> 11:27.900
make sure you start
with aunt Dorothy.

11:33.567 --> 11:36.867
Wait!
Wait a minute! Wait!

11:36.934 --> 11:39.600
You two just met.

11:39.667 --> 11:41.166
You don't even
know each other.

11:41.233 --> 11:43.533
This is how the eskimos do it.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.033
(Blanche) Oh!

11:45.100 --> 11:47.767
Listen, whatever it is
you think you're feeling,

11:47.834 --> 11:49.967
it's your hormones
playing tricks on you.

11:50.033 --> 11:52.000
The ears now!

11:57.900 --> 12:00.333
My God! What have I done?

12:00.400 --> 12:01.900
I think it's romantic.

12:01.967 --> 12:04.367
It's like something out
of a forties movie.

12:04.433 --> 12:09.367
Strong, handsome, daring...
and now she's got a man.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.900
Look, Lucas, you cannot do this.

12:15.967 --> 12:19.467
-What do you two have in common?
-I'll show you!

12:20.567 --> 12:22.600
(Blanche) Aah!

12:22.667 --> 12:24.066
Oh!

12:26.300 --> 12:28.633
Sophia, speak up!

12:28.700 --> 12:30.166
Don't let her run off
with the first man

12:30.233 --> 12:32.400
and I do mean the first,
that comes along.

12:32.467 --> 12:34.567
All right, all right.

12:34.633 --> 12:37.500
Now listen, Johnny Reb.

12:37.567 --> 12:39.767
You march through
my front door a stranger

12:39.834 --> 12:42.767
and ask for my daughter's hand
without two words about yourself.

12:42.834 --> 12:44.000
What do you want to know?

12:44.066 --> 12:45.433
Do you have any money?

12:45.500 --> 12:47.166
Quite a bit, ma'am.

12:47.233 --> 12:48.800
Is your mother still alive?

12:48.867 --> 12:49.734
No.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.333
She is now.

12:55.166 --> 12:57.000
Oh, Blanche!
Oh, honey. Oh, Blanche.

13:01.967 --> 13:05.433
(calm music playing)

13:05.934 --> 13:08.800
Ahh!
Well, it's been a long day.

13:08.867 --> 13:11.734
Especially for you, Blanche.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.900
But I'm really enjoying this.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.800
Sitting here, just the three of us,

13:15.867 --> 13:17.867
having a quiet cup
of coffee together.

13:17.934 --> 13:20.433
-Me too. Because--
-I said coffee!

13:28.734 --> 13:30.934
So how does it feel?

13:32.333 --> 13:35.600
Shame. I feel shame.

13:35.667 --> 13:38.867
I can't believe you two carrying on

13:38.934 --> 13:41.600
when another woman's
about to steal my destiny.

13:41.667 --> 13:43.100
I always thought it'd be me

13:43.166 --> 13:46.133
closing out my years
in Hollingsworth manor.

13:46.200 --> 13:49.367
If anybody has a right
to complain, it's me.

13:49.433 --> 13:52.200
When Dorothy gets married,
think about this,

13:52.266 --> 13:54.300
she'll be a Hollingsworth.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.734
Lucas and Blanche are already
Hollingsworths.

13:56.800 --> 14:00.166
Sophia will be a
Hollingsworth-in-law.

14:00.233 --> 14:02.100
Everybody will be related but me.

14:02.166 --> 14:04.100
Now that's what I call
family planning.

14:06.633 --> 14:08.667
It's not funny.

14:08.734 --> 14:11.967
Did anybody ever stop to think
how all this makes me feel?

14:12.033 --> 14:14.633
Oh, all right, Rose.
How does it make you feel?

14:14.700 --> 14:17.533
To be honest, a little bit
like Mr. Snuffles.

14:19.100 --> 14:22.834
Blanche, would you mind?
You're closer to the knife drawer.

14:25.700 --> 14:27.367
One summer when I was a little girl,

14:27.433 --> 14:31.300
Henrietta, our pig,
gave birth to a litter of six.

14:31.367 --> 14:34.166
And the next day,
my father won the annual

14:34.233 --> 14:38.300
St. Olaf watermelon
seed spitting contest.

14:38.367 --> 14:40.800
And he brought home
a prized piglet.

14:40.867 --> 14:42.967
-Mr. Snuffles?
-Exactly.

14:43.033 --> 14:44.233
You're listening?

14:46.333 --> 14:49.166
Anyway, I loved Mr. Snuffles.

14:49.233 --> 14:52.500
I watched him grow,
I suffered with him.

14:52.567 --> 14:56.133
The way Henrietta's brood made him
feel like such an outsider.

14:57.533 --> 14:59.333
It was an awful thing to see.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.467
Hey, hearing it
is no walk in the park.

15:02.900 --> 15:06.834
Mr. Snuffles never did get over
his feeling of alienation.

15:06.900 --> 15:08.867
He grew fat and despondent.

15:08.934 --> 15:12.800
The last report we had on him he
stowed away on a truck to Chicago.

15:12.867 --> 15:16.467
And tearfully, surrendered himself
to the Oscar Mayer people.

15:17.934 --> 15:20.433
I don't want that to happen to me,
Sophia.

15:20.500 --> 15:23.300
We can't promise you that,
Rose.

15:24.633 --> 15:26.200
I've got to do something.

15:26.266 --> 15:30.867
I can't sit idly back
and let this wedding take place.

15:30.934 --> 15:36.100
How in the name of mother Dixie
can a woman named... Zbornak

15:36.166 --> 15:39.934
appreciate the majesty
of Hollingsworth manor?

15:40.000 --> 15:42.033
Sitting on the veranda
with her mother.

15:45.033 --> 15:48.333
What makes you think the newlyweds
will welcome you on the premises?

15:48.400 --> 15:49.800
What are you saying?

15:49.867 --> 15:52.433
Uncle Lucas may not
be as fond of nasty,

15:52.500 --> 15:56.066
hateful, life-scarring barbs
as the rest of us are.

15:57.033 --> 15:58.200
And your point is?

16:00.300 --> 16:03.000
Dorothy and Lucas
may not want you around.

16:03.066 --> 16:06.000
Say, there's a fly in the Metamucil.

16:09.734 --> 16:12.433
Dorothy, it was very sweet
of you to join me.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.633
Am I safe in assuming

16:13.700 --> 16:17.300
your first hardware convention
is also your last?

16:17.367 --> 16:20.233
Does a roofing nail
have a flat head?

16:20.300 --> 16:22.333
Oh, you were actually
paying attention.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.400
Look, Lucas, no offense,

16:24.467 --> 16:27.300
but hardware doesn't
sound terribly romantic.

16:27.367 --> 16:29.266
So when you come by tomorrow,

16:29.333 --> 16:32.834
tell Blanche you took me to hear
the Emerson String Quartet.

16:32.900 --> 16:34.066
I love it!

16:34.133 --> 16:36.200
Do you think they'd buy

16:36.266 --> 16:38.500
that afterwards
we frolicked in the ocean?

16:38.567 --> 16:42.767
Oh, gosh.
I haven't frolicked since...

16:42.834 --> 16:47.100
well, since the day I dropped
my mother off at Shady Pines.

16:48.633 --> 16:51.767
Coincidentally, that was
the last time I did a cartwheel.

16:53.767 --> 16:55.133
It was a good day.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.233
Of course, we could
tell them that we...

17:00.000 --> 17:03.734
went up to lovers' lane
and that we necked.

17:03.800 --> 17:07.533
Oh, well, then I'd have
to smear my lipstick,

17:07.600 --> 17:09.767
you know, for effect.

17:10.266 --> 17:12.166
Here. Let me.

17:23.533 --> 17:26.233
(serene music playing)

17:26.300 --> 17:28.066
I've been thinking about
your suggestion, Dorothy.

17:28.133 --> 17:30.767
You're right.
The columns come down.

17:30.834 --> 17:34.900
The new Hollingsworth manor
should be red brick, cape cod.

17:34.967 --> 17:36.700
Oh!

17:36.767 --> 17:39.266
Blanche,
I didn't know you were home.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.700
Haven't seen you much
this trip, sugarplum.

17:41.767 --> 17:45.500
That's because you've been too
busy Yankee doodling.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.433
Blanche, I'm sure
you don't mean that.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.867
You'll feel differently
when you come to our hoedown

17:50.934 --> 17:54.700
on the anniversary
of Lee's Surrender.

17:54.767 --> 17:56.533
Oh!

18:10.600 --> 18:13.400
Well, if it ain't the kinfolk.

18:14.433 --> 18:16.967
Hope you brought your appetite,
young fella.

18:17.033 --> 18:19.266
You're gonna be pleased
with the dinner.

18:20.734 --> 18:25.600
Corn pone, succotash, collard greens
and them is just the appetizers.

18:27.967 --> 18:32.000
Sorry to interrupt everybody, but
I have an announcement to make.

18:33.100 --> 18:34.133
A mess o' something!

18:34.200 --> 18:36.834
I'll Skeer us up
a mess o' something.

18:44.867 --> 18:48.100
Anyway, I've been doing
a lot of soul-searching.

18:48.166 --> 18:52.233
And as long as the family isn't
going to be together anymore,

18:52.300 --> 18:54.567
it's just not going to be the same.

18:54.633 --> 18:57.867
So, I've decided
I'm going to move in

18:57.934 --> 18:59.133
with my daughter Kirsten.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.166
-I think that's best.
-Leave?

19:01.233 --> 19:05.467
You're going to leave?
Rose you can't do that!

19:05.533 --> 19:07.867
Well, you see! Do you?

19:07.934 --> 19:11.800
Because of your $1.98 romance,
you are destroying the family.

19:11.867 --> 19:15.400
You're destroying the family,
and I'm going to be all alone!

19:15.900 --> 19:19.066
I'll make her some tea
and calm her down.

19:19.133 --> 19:21.166
-I'll talk to her.
-Dorothy, wait.

19:21.233 --> 19:23.867
-This has gone too far.
-I know.

19:23.934 --> 19:26.333
You can't flat out tell her.

19:26.400 --> 19:29.033
She realizes this is a joke,
you know Blanche.

19:29.100 --> 19:31.633
-It will do more harm than good.
-Then what do I say?

19:31.700 --> 19:35.233
I know something that could work.
We'll break up in front of her.

19:35.300 --> 19:37.100
-Just like that?
-Sure.

19:37.166 --> 19:40.166
Between the succotash
and the mess o' something.

19:41.867 --> 19:44.500
We blow up, I storm out,
and that's that.

19:44.567 --> 19:47.233
And I stay behind
and call off the wedding.

19:47.300 --> 19:48.500
Perfect.

19:48.567 --> 19:49.600
Dorothy, it's...

19:50.667 --> 19:53.700
not going to be easy
to pick a fight with you.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.500
What?

19:55.567 --> 19:58.300
I want you to promise
that you won't laugh.

19:58.367 --> 20:03.633
These past three days have been the
lightest and brightest I've known

20:03.700 --> 20:07.533
since Edna passed,
and I just want to thank you.

20:08.033 --> 20:10.000
Well, I'm glad.

20:10.066 --> 20:13.333
But, to tell you the truth,
I didn't even notice.

20:13.400 --> 20:17.433
I mean, I've been
so busy smiling myself.

20:17.500 --> 20:18.667
Well, I'm glad too.

20:18.734 --> 20:21.900
Strange, isn't it?

20:21.967 --> 20:26.100
Seems like we've known each other
for a lot more than three days.

20:27.633 --> 20:29.633
(clanging)

20:33.266 --> 20:34.667
Cocktails!

20:36.867 --> 20:40.700
Oh. How classy.
A tribute to hop sing.

20:41.934 --> 20:43.967
Here you go, Sophia.

20:45.100 --> 20:48.467
Before you pass this out,
I want to say something.

20:48.533 --> 20:51.367
Blanche, don't say anything
you're going to regret.

20:51.433 --> 20:52.900
I know what I'm doing.

20:52.967 --> 20:54.800
You two, please sit down.

20:58.734 --> 21:00.767
A terrible mistake
has been made here,

21:00.834 --> 21:02.166
and I'm the one who made it.

21:03.200 --> 21:08.433
I thought you all would go out once,
eat a boring dinner,

21:08.500 --> 21:10.233
tell a couple of boring stories,

21:10.300 --> 21:13.066
and get back to your boring lives.
No harm done.

21:13.567 --> 21:15.667
But somehow, some way...

21:16.166 --> 21:19.033
you seem to have taken
a liking to each other.

21:19.100 --> 21:21.800
You believe you were
meant to be together.

21:22.867 --> 21:25.467
Well, let me tell you what I see.

21:25.533 --> 21:26.900
I see...

21:28.767 --> 21:31.667
I see... a miracle.

21:32.900 --> 21:35.467
I see two people
who've been afraid to reach out,

21:35.533 --> 21:39.300
afraid to take that first step
toward real feeling,

21:39.367 --> 21:42.400
two people gazing
into each other's eyes

21:42.467 --> 21:48.400
and sharing each other's concerns,
caring about each other's happiness.

21:48.467 --> 21:50.233
I see two people in love.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.767
I was trying to drive
a wedge between you

21:54.834 --> 21:57.400
because I didn't want
to be left alone,

21:57.467 --> 22:00.400
but I'm ashamed of that now.

22:00.467 --> 22:03.667
So... I'm not going
to oppose this union.

22:03.734 --> 22:06.467
I'm going to celebrate it,
lift a glass to it,

22:06.533 --> 22:09.033
I'm going to ask God to bless it.

22:10.533 --> 22:11.867
Lucas, Dorothy...

22:13.367 --> 22:16.967
from the bottom of my heart...
congratulations.

22:18.100 --> 22:19.400
I love you both.

22:20.667 --> 22:25.300
Blanche...
there is something I must say.

22:25.367 --> 22:26.567
Dorothy...

22:29.533 --> 22:30.867
Dorothy...

22:32.767 --> 22:35.133
will you marry me for real?

22:39.433 --> 22:40.633
For real?

22:41.834 --> 22:42.900
For real.

22:44.667 --> 22:49.033
Oh, yes, Lucas.
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.300
Is it my stroke,
or did they do this already?

23:10.166 --> 23:13.600
(theme music playing)
