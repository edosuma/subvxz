00:16.224 --> 00:18.807
It is a time
of chaos in the Zooverse.

00:18.809 --> 00:21.978
Two opposing forces have
emerged, the Nice side

00:21.980 --> 00:25.313
and the Mice side, each seeking
to wield the most powerful

00:25.315 --> 00:29.444
force in the Zooverse,
the power of the sauce.

00:29.446 --> 00:32.363
Bongo Bananas, the last
of the Nice Side Warriors,

00:32.365 --> 00:35.491
has long gone missing, and no
other space hero has stepped

00:35.493 --> 00:37.952
up to fill his place.

00:37.954 --> 00:40.997
In his absence, Boo Boo Squeal,
the ruler of the Mice Side,

00:40.999 --> 00:42.959
has grown strong.

00:43.999 --> 00:45.501
Princess Sparklefeather,
the leader of the Nice Side,

00:45.503 --> 00:46.963
is on the run.

00:48.088 --> 00:50.631
The ultimate battle between
the Nice Side and the Mice Side

00:50.633 --> 00:53.092
is about to unfold.

00:53.094 --> 00:55.595
Finding the legendary Chosen
One is the Nice Side's

00:55.597 --> 00:56.389
only hope.

01:13.989 --> 01:16.240
Boo Boo, we searched this
entire galaxy

01:16.242 --> 01:17.199
for the Chosen One.

01:17.201 --> 01:18.868
We found nothing.

01:18.870 --> 01:19.871
Aw fetter.

01:21.164 --> 01:25.291
I can already feel the
Chosen One within my grasp.

01:25.293 --> 01:28.252
But at last, we must continue
to scour the Zooverse

01:28.254 --> 01:29.796
until we find him.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.172
Why are you looking for
the Chosen One, Boo Boo?

01:32.174 --> 01:34.383
How many times do I
have to tell you,

01:34.385 --> 01:35.969
you silly pachyderm?

01:37.138 --> 01:40.889
The Chosen One is the only
one who stands between me,

01:40.891 --> 01:44.434
Boo Boo Squeal, the most
powerful animal in the Zooverse,

01:44.436 --> 01:46.522
and universal domination.

01:48.233 --> 01:52.192
But Boo Boo, the Chosen One
is a myth.

01:52.194 --> 01:56.113
It's kind of been completely
obliterated ions ago.

01:56.115 --> 01:59.574
He's not a myth, he's
out there somewhere.

01:59.576 --> 02:02.119
We must find him
and destroy him.

02:02.121 --> 02:04.163
Is that understood?

02:04.165 --> 02:06.249
You're so cute
when you're evil.

02:06.251 --> 02:08.375
What did you say?

02:08.377 --> 02:11.754
Uh, I said, you're
so evil Boo Boo Squeal.

02:11.756 --> 02:15.340
So absolutely evil,
and not cute at all.

02:15.342 --> 02:16.341
That's what I thought.

02:16.343 --> 02:18.219
Now get me some guacamole.

02:18.221 --> 02:20.807
I must replenish my sauce power.

02:22.349 --> 02:24.225
Frog mercenary Chewie
Chewflies has captured

02:24.227 --> 02:26.435
Princess Sparklefeather, sir.

02:26.437 --> 02:28.103
Hurray!

02:28.105 --> 02:31.357
Instruct Chewflies to bring
her to me.

02:31.359 --> 02:34.901
Princess Sparklefeather is at
my mercy.

02:34.903 --> 02:38.239
The nice side is
reduced to rubble.

02:40.409 --> 02:43.411
Once I get the Chosen One
out of the way,

02:43.413 --> 02:46.374
I will ride from
universe to universe,

02:47.417 --> 02:51.335
galaxy to galaxy,
dimension to dimension,

02:51.337 --> 02:53.213
completely unstoppable.

02:54.257 --> 02:57.093
The universe will be my Gruyere.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.937
Meanwhile, in a
remote galaxy

05:15.939 --> 05:18.733
by the Zortix Nebula on
Planet Zootrini,

05:18.735 --> 05:21.651
a very special elephant
awaited his destiny.

05:21.653 --> 05:26.449
A destiny that would change
the Zooverse forever.

05:33.916 --> 05:35.707
Hey Tiptoes.

05:35.709 --> 05:38.627
I want that code written
by the end of the day.

05:38.629 --> 05:39.503
You hear me?

05:39.505 --> 05:41.256
You got it, boss.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.800
How did we end up here, Marty?

05:44.802 --> 05:47.469
Ah, I couldn't tell you, Nuke.

05:47.471 --> 05:49.262
This life is all I know.

05:49.264 --> 05:50.430
How long have you been here?

05:50.432 --> 05:53.685
Ah, try a trillion Plutonian
ions, Nuke.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.435
Oh, that's a while.

05:55.437 --> 05:57.647
A heck of a while.

05:57.649 --> 05:59.690
This is unjust, Marty, unjust!

05:59.692 --> 06:02.192
Unusual, and
downright unbearable.

06:02.194 --> 06:05.488
I'm Nuke Tiptoes, an
elephant for tusk's sake.

06:05.490 --> 06:06.863
A proud beast.

06:06.865 --> 06:09.784
Majestic, highly intelligent,
deeply emotional.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.495
I belong in the open
spaces of the galaxy.

06:12.497 --> 06:15.373
I long for a life of adventure,
Marty.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.666
A life of excitement.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.625
That's not the
way it is anymore.

06:18.627 --> 06:20.670
What happened to us, Marty?

06:20.672 --> 06:22.546
What happened to
all the animals?

06:22.548 --> 06:25.300
We got too serious.

06:25.300 --> 06:28.385
Are you an elephant or a
snail, Tiptoes?

06:28.387 --> 06:29.469
Pick up the pace.

06:29.471 --> 06:31.430
We got deadlines to meet.

06:31.432 --> 06:33.808
Okay, okay, take it
easy for peanut's sake.

06:33.810 --> 06:37.689
These computers keys are
too small for my toes.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.399
One of these days, Marty.

06:42.401 --> 06:43.901
One of these days.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.485
I'll be waiting.

06:45.487 --> 06:47.697
Say, how about a carrot
juice by the watering hole

06:47.699 --> 06:48.613
after work, Marty?

06:48.615 --> 06:49.656
Eh.

06:49.658 --> 06:51.868
Carrot juice gives me the hives.

06:53.329 --> 06:54.411
Hello Nuke.

06:54.413 --> 06:55.456
Do you hear me?

06:56.540 --> 06:57.373
Who's that?

06:57.375 --> 06:58.457
It's me.

06:58.459 --> 06:59.251
Me who?

07:00.377 --> 07:02.127
How do you know my name?

07:02.129 --> 07:05.214
There's no time,
you must do as I say.

07:05.216 --> 07:08.425
Not until you tell me
who you are and how you got

07:08.427 --> 07:09.760
into my head.

07:09.762 --> 07:12.055
I can get you
off this planet, Nuke.

07:12.057 --> 07:14.389
This is not where you belong.

07:14.391 --> 07:16.767
But if you'd rather stay
here and keep slaving

07:16.769 --> 07:20.103
for the system for a
couple of peanuts a day...

07:20.105 --> 07:22.065
Hey Nuke, all good over there?

07:22.067 --> 07:23.733
Just taking a peanut break,
Marty.

07:23.735 --> 07:26.569
Eh, peanuts give
me the hives.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.820
Forget the peanuts,
Nuke.

07:28.822 --> 07:33.036
Hit enter and your destiny
will be changed forever.

07:34.704 --> 07:37.581
Like I said earlier,
there's no time.

07:39.541 --> 07:42.709
Now there's even less time
than the last time I said it.

07:42.711 --> 07:43.961
My destiny?

07:43.963 --> 07:47.048
Yeah, you have a
destiny, my elephant friend.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.382
I do?

07:48.384 --> 07:49.675
You don't really
believe you were meant

07:49.677 --> 07:51.844
to work in a cubicle
and eat peanuts

07:51.846 --> 07:53.930
for the rest of your life,
do you?

07:53.932 --> 07:55.055
I like peanuts.

07:55.057 --> 07:56.848
Fine, Nuke, dude.

07:56.850 --> 07:59.226
You can still eat peanuts.

07:59.228 --> 08:01.228
Will you just hit enter already?

08:01.230 --> 08:02.690
Okay. I'll do it.

08:03.774 --> 08:04.565
Wait.

08:04.567 --> 08:05.817
What?

08:05.819 --> 08:08.360
Be sure the
truth is what you seek.

08:08.362 --> 08:11.572
Once you hit enter, there's no
going back.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.865
The truth about what?

08:13.867 --> 08:16.618
The truth about
who you really are, Nuke.

08:16.620 --> 08:18.745
Alright, I'm ready.

08:18.747 --> 08:19.831
Wait!

08:19.833 --> 08:21.039
What now?

08:21.041 --> 08:22.834
Be sure that you're
sure, Nuke.

08:22.836 --> 08:26.671
I was sure, but now
I'm not so sure anymore.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.716
Why aren't you sure,
Nuke?

08:29.718 --> 08:32.759
Don't you long for the
truth, my elephant friend?

08:32.760 --> 08:33.760
I do.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.179
I long for truth.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.972
But I'm just an elephant in
a room full of fancy gadgets.

08:37.975 --> 08:39.642
I don't know the first
thing about the truth.

08:39.644 --> 08:42.645
You know nothing
about the truth, Nuke.

08:42.647 --> 08:43.729
Unless...

08:43.731 --> 08:45.649
Unless?

08:45.649 --> 08:47.608
You hit enter.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.193
Alright, alright.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.280
Here it goes.

08:51.780 --> 08:52.573
Right?

08:53.741 --> 08:55.074
Hello?

08:55.076 --> 08:56.783
Well never mind.

08:57.828 --> 08:59.078
Nuke!

08:59.080 --> 09:00.204
You again.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.959
Sorry, overactive
bladder syndrome.

09:03.999 --> 09:05.459
I had to take a quick
bathroom break.

09:05.461 --> 09:07.670
You understand, Nuke, my friend.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.379
Now, where were we?

09:09.381 --> 09:10.172
Oh yes.

09:10.174 --> 09:11.882
You were about to hit enter.

09:11.884 --> 09:12.967
That's still current?

09:12.969 --> 09:14.634
Ready when you are,
Nuke.

09:14.636 --> 09:15.511
Alright then.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.055
Here goes nothin'.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.895
Whoa, where in the space
tusks am I?

09:23.687 --> 09:25.563
And who the galactic peanuts
are you?

09:25.565 --> 09:29.650
I'm B-52 of the Nice Side
Robotic Fleet.

09:29.652 --> 09:30.693
Where am I?

09:30.695 --> 09:34.740
Welcome to the
Sparkle Express.

09:38.952 --> 09:41.746
The Sparkle Express?

09:41.748 --> 09:45.416
Prince Sparklefeather's
personal fleet vessel.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.709
And who's Princess
Sparklefeather?

09:46.711 --> 09:50.713
Do you live under a rock
carbon-based life form?

09:50.715 --> 09:54.052
She's only the leader of the
Nice Side.

09:56.804 --> 09:59.513
Uh, sorry, I don't keep
up with social media much.

09:59.515 --> 10:00.765
Wait, are we moving?

10:00.767 --> 10:02.268
Oh, you betcha.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.896
This baby is made to fly.

10:09.942 --> 10:10.858
Where are we going?

10:10.860 --> 10:11.983
On a mission.

10:11.985 --> 10:13.486
Space elephants.

10:13.488 --> 10:14.277
A mission?

10:14.279 --> 10:16.196
Oh, positive, carbon-based.

10:16.198 --> 10:19.908
A mission that will alter the
course of galactic history.

10:19.910 --> 10:22.744
You see, carbon-based,
Princess Sparklefeather

10:22.746 --> 10:25.665
has been kidnapped by the
Mice Side.

10:25.667 --> 10:28.542
After we crash-landed on
Planet Bubbles,

10:28.544 --> 10:31.923
I have been programmed to help
her escape.

10:32.881 --> 10:34.382
Whoa.

10:34.384 --> 10:37.719
In order to fulfill
the mission,

10:37.721 --> 10:39.887
we seek an ally.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.013
An ally?

10:41.015 --> 10:44.019
A rebel squirrel named
Squeezy Whistle.

10:51.442 --> 10:54.944
I have delivered the
Princess to you, Boo Boo.

10:54.946 --> 10:56.820
Excellent.

10:56.822 --> 11:01.199
I expect the two flies and
three gnats I've been promised.

11:01.201 --> 11:04.829
I've never promised three
gnats to you, Chewflies.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.331
I said two gnats.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.960
You said three.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.419
No way.

11:11.421 --> 11:14.546
I would never have agreed to
three gnats.

11:14.548 --> 11:16.424
You have too.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.217
Chubby, check the books.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.762
Did I ever agree to three gnats?

11:20.764 --> 11:25.307
Says right here,
"Chewflies gets three gnats."

11:25.309 --> 11:26.934
The books are wrong!

11:26.936 --> 11:28.435
Two gnats.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.528
We gotta change course.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.488
This meteor storm doesn't
seem to want to end.

11:39.490 --> 11:43.825
Negative, homeostatic
cellular organism.

11:43.827 --> 11:46.161
Directive is to maintain course.

11:46.163 --> 11:48.915
Contact with The Cashew
is imminent.

11:48.917 --> 11:49.959
The Cashew?

11:50.999 --> 11:55.631
Squeezy Whistle's
space vessel.

11:55.631 --> 12:00.509
We should make contact in just
under 50 million light years.

12:00.511 --> 12:02.512
You're saying I escaped a
lifetime of pencil pushing

12:02.514 --> 12:03.970
just to spend the next
50 million light years

12:03.972 --> 12:05.349
in a meteor storm?

12:11.648 --> 12:15.023
Oh, I don't think my
poor stomach can take it.

12:15.025 --> 12:16.191
There must be another way.

12:16.193 --> 12:18.986
There is another way.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.781
For the love
of peanuts, what is it?

12:22.783 --> 12:24.869
The Nebula Five Wormhole.

12:26.287 --> 12:27.911
Okay, we're dead.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.914
Nuke, I want you to...

12:29.916 --> 12:31.081
Voice?

12:31.083 --> 12:33.501
Yes, Nuke,
my elephant friend.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.588
My name is Bongo Bananas.

12:36.630 --> 12:39.757
- Now, I want you to...
- Bongo Bananas?

12:39.759 --> 12:42.426
Yes, Nuke,
such is my name.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.052
Now, I want you to...

12:44.054 --> 12:46.013
Look, Bongo, whatever your
name is.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.556
I'm traveling at break tusk
speed through

12:47.558 --> 12:49.975
a meteor storm with a robot
named after a 90's new wave

12:49.977 --> 12:52.978
band who's suggesting we enter
the Nebula Five Wormhole.

12:52.980 --> 12:54.897
For all the floppy ears
in the galaxy,

12:54.899 --> 12:56.898
what could you possibly want
from me now?

12:56.900 --> 12:58.443
Glad you asked, Nuke.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.945
I want you to take command of
the ship

13:00.947 --> 13:04.489
and steer it through the
Nebula Five Wormhole.

13:04.491 --> 13:05.532
What?

13:05.534 --> 13:06.908
It's your only hope.

13:06.910 --> 13:10.371
A meteor will collide
with your ship in nine,

13:10.373 --> 13:11.166
eight,

13:12.000 --> 13:13.999
seven.

13:13.043 --> 13:14.083
Give me that.

13:14.085 --> 13:15.417
Now what?

13:15.419 --> 13:17.085
Which way, voice, which way?

13:17.087 --> 13:18.212
Four,

13:18.214 --> 13:19.379
three,

13:19.381 --> 13:21.089
two,

13:21.091 --> 13:22.215
repeat after me.

13:22.217 --> 13:23.675
Bechamel!

13:23.677 --> 13:24.596
Bechamel?

13:30.894 --> 13:32.352
Whoa.

13:32.354 --> 13:34.103
Are we dead?

13:34.105 --> 13:34.978
I'll check coordinates.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.689
Stand by.

13:36.691 --> 13:38.023
Negative.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.025
We're in

13:39.027 --> 13:41.526
the Sauce Dimension.

13:41.528 --> 13:42.903
The Sauce Dimension?

13:42.905 --> 13:46.867
The Sauce flows through the
entire universe, carbon-based.

13:47.994 --> 13:51.996
We have just entered the
Sauce Dimension,

13:51.998 --> 13:53.750
where all is sauce.

13:57.128 --> 13:58.502
Is it dangerous?

13:58.504 --> 14:02.133
Oh, if not wielded wisely,
the Sauce can destroy.

14:03.134 --> 14:06.261
The Sauce is power.

14:06.261 --> 14:07.804
Amazing.

14:07.806 --> 14:10.806
If anybody can control this
stuff, they'd be unstoppable.

14:10.808 --> 14:14.977
Oh, where have you been,
carbon-based?

14:14.979 --> 14:17.647
Don't you know, Boo
Boo Squeal has garnered

14:17.649 --> 14:21.943
enough Sauce power to
destroy the Zooverse.

14:21.945 --> 14:24.152
The Sauce can destroy
the Zooverse?

14:24.154 --> 14:25.238
Oh yes.

14:25.240 --> 14:28.156
The Sauce can be used for good,

14:28.158 --> 14:32.119
but with a bit too much
garlic, it can evil.

14:32.121 --> 14:35.623
Boo Boo Squeal has already
obliterated the Nice Side

14:35.625 --> 14:39.837
starship and captured my mistress,
Princess Sparklefeather.

14:40.797 --> 14:44.632
He will try to extract
from her the whereabouts

14:44.634 --> 14:46.010
of the Chosen One.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.262
The Chosen One?

14:49.264 --> 14:50.054
Hello?

14:50.056 --> 14:51.305
Anyone in there?

14:51.307 --> 14:54.099
The Nice Side's only hope.

14:54.101 --> 14:56.560
Don't you follow social media?

14:56.562 --> 14:57.353
Twitter?

14:57.355 --> 14:58.271
Snapchat?

14:58.273 --> 15:00.690
You lost me at Sauce.

15:05.363 --> 15:06.239
We're back.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.074
The Cashew.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.161
We have located it.

15:13.163 --> 15:13.953
Wow.

15:13.955 --> 15:15.121
Small universe.

15:15.123 --> 15:18.916
Get to the Cashew,
Nuke, and seek Squeezy Whistle.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.252
He will help you
fulfill your destiny.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.338
We must get to the Cashew.

15:23.340 --> 15:25.506
Negative, carbon-based.

15:25.508 --> 15:29.176
Squeezy Whistle will pulverize
anything that approaches

15:29.178 --> 15:30.052
his ship.

15:30.054 --> 15:32.972
You must get
to the Cashew, Nuke.

15:32.974 --> 15:35.932
Repeat after me, Bechamel.

15:35.934 --> 15:37.602
Not Bechamel again.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.603
I can't take anymore...

15:39.605 --> 15:40.398
Sauce.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.242
Wow.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.911
Are we aboard the Cashew?

15:54.913 --> 15:56.411
Confirmed.

15:56.413 --> 15:57.997
Who's Squeezy Whistle anyway?

15:57.999 --> 16:01.249
Squeezy Whistle,
rebel squirrel.

16:01.251 --> 16:04.878
He escaped the Mice Side and
went rouge.

16:04.880 --> 16:08.632
He has no loyalties, but
can be hired, for a price.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.593
Who the chestnuts are you?

16:10.595 --> 16:11.386
Squeezy?

16:11.388 --> 16:12.971
Yeah, you got him.

16:19.104 --> 16:22.063
Now who are you and what
are you doing on my ship?

16:22.065 --> 16:26.277
You've got three seconds to
answer before I pulverize you.

16:27.153 --> 16:30.070
And the countdown starts now.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.196
Three,

16:31.198 --> 16:32.824
two...

16:32.826 --> 16:34.242
We need to rescue
Princess Sparklefeather

16:34.244 --> 16:35.868
who has been kidnapped by
Boo Boo Squeal who wants

16:35.870 --> 16:37.744
to find the Chosen One and
destroy him so he can wield

16:37.746 --> 16:39.247
the power of the Sauce
unopposed and take over

16:39.249 --> 16:41.331
the entire universe.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.001
Did I forget anything?

16:43.003 --> 16:45.294
To breathe, carbon-based.

16:45.296 --> 16:47.964
Princess Sparklefeather's
been kidnapped?

16:47.966 --> 16:48.881
Yes.

16:48.883 --> 16:49.674
Will you help?

16:49.676 --> 16:51.217
No.

16:51.219 --> 16:54.970
Princess Sparklefeather sent
me specifically to find you.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.597
She said you would help.

16:56.599 --> 16:57.723
Oh yeah?

16:57.725 --> 17:00.184
Well Princess Sparklefeather
was wrong.

17:00.186 --> 17:03.311
Now see yourself off my ship.

17:06.776 --> 17:09.317
What's our
trajectory, Chubby?

17:09.319 --> 17:11.445
We're on our way to Planet
Sprinkles, Boo Boo Squeal.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.155
Just as you command.

17:13.156 --> 17:16.159
We will destroy their way
of life by dumping moldy

17:16.161 --> 17:18.994
Gruyere into their stratosphere.

17:20.957 --> 17:25.667
Sometimes I just don't know
how I come up with this stuff.

17:25.670 --> 17:27.420
You're so cute when
you're evil, Boo Boo.

17:27.422 --> 17:29.338
What did you say?

17:29.340 --> 17:32.007
I said, you're just so evil,
Boo Boo.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.469
Just absolutely evil.

17:34.471 --> 17:37.263
I thought you called me cute.

17:37.265 --> 17:38.055
Me?

17:38.057 --> 17:39.015
Never.

17:39.017 --> 17:39.974
I meant cruel.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.183
Yeah, that's what I meant.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.353
You're not cute at all,
far from it.

17:43.355 --> 17:45.938
You're actually quite unsightly
Boo Boo.

17:45.940 --> 17:48.065
Grotesque, even.

17:50.694 --> 17:54.322
Never seen a more hideous
looking rodent all my life.

17:54.324 --> 17:56.407
Unlovely as they come.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.159
You called me cute.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.535
No, I didn't.

17:59.537 --> 18:00.661
You did.

18:00.663 --> 18:01.453
I didn't.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.038
You did.

18:03.040 --> 18:03.998
Nope.

18:04.000 --> 18:04.959
Chubby?

18:05.999 --> 18:05.792
Okay.

18:05.794 --> 18:08.878
I did, but you're just so cute.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.631
A beady eyed, fluffy,
adorable little mouse.

18:11.633 --> 18:13.093
It's just too much.

18:14.469 --> 18:17.386
For Gruyere's sake,
Chubby, stop calling me cute.

18:17.388 --> 18:21.350
I'm Boo Boo Squeal, the most
evil mouse in the Zooverse.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.395
I'm not cute.

18:25.689 --> 18:26.480
But...

18:28.232 --> 18:29.481
You are.

18:29.483 --> 18:30.440
I'm not.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.359
You are.

18:31.361 --> 18:32.776
Chubby.

18:32.778 --> 18:33.777
Yes?

18:33.779 --> 18:36.449
Don't make me deploy
the Sauce.

18:38.410 --> 18:40.575
Oh no, not the Sauce.

18:40.577 --> 18:42.953
What will it be this time?

18:42.955 --> 18:44.247
Tabasco?

18:44.249 --> 18:45.206
No.

18:45.208 --> 18:46.625
Not the Tabasco.

18:47.626 --> 18:48.544
Sriracha?

18:49.712 --> 18:51.254
No, please, Boo Boo.

18:51.256 --> 18:52.966
No, not the Sriracha.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.341
Okay then.

18:55.343 --> 18:56.758
Am I cute?

18:56.760 --> 18:57.844
No.

18:57.846 --> 19:01.516
You're decisively not cute.

19:01.516 --> 19:03.852
The Princess has arrived.

19:05.019 --> 19:07.186
Excellent, Captain Ripp.

19:07.188 --> 19:08.355
Bring her to me.

19:15.446 --> 19:18.322
We will not leave
until you agree to help

19:18.324 --> 19:19.824
Princess Sparklefeather.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.909
Eh, well then you leave me
no choice

19:21.911 --> 19:23.911
but to pulverize you.

19:23.913 --> 19:24.871
We're leaving.

19:24.873 --> 19:26.458
Oh no, we are not.

19:27.375 --> 19:30.168
Surrender your ship now,
Squeezy, or I'll have no

19:30.170 --> 19:33.964
mercy on your rodent pelt.

19:33.964 --> 19:35.506
Ah, just what we need.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.923
Who's that?

19:36.925 --> 19:40.260
Oh, that's Coot Coot
Carburetor, the bounty hunter.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.388
Why is he after you?

19:42.390 --> 19:44.097
Oh, he ain't after me.

19:44.099 --> 19:45.894
He's after the Cashew.

19:46.769 --> 19:49.394
I lost it to him in a game
of old knots.

19:49.396 --> 19:51.773
Yeah, but I'll be a used
chew stick if I give my ship

19:51.775 --> 19:53.607
up to that ugly hog.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.567
Ready to hand over my ship,
Squeezy?

19:55.569 --> 19:56.361
Never.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.278
Then I'll destroy it.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.489
And you along with it.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.418
Yeah hold to your hide,
peanuts,

20:12.420 --> 20:15.129
it's gonna be a bumpy ride.

20:24.516 --> 20:26.308
Whoa.

20:26.308 --> 20:30.644
Oh we have no time
for skirmishes, Squeezy.

20:30.646 --> 20:34.440
We must rescue
Princess Sparklefeather.

20:42.659 --> 20:45.450
Yeah, the Cashew is my
Princess, robot.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.370
We gotta get out of here.

20:47.372 --> 20:50.414
That's exactly what I intend
to do.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.583
Engage hyperdrive.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.835
Hyperdrive engaged.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.136
So long, sucker.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.274
Ew, Boo Boo Squeal!

21:15.733 --> 21:20.152
In the fur, your highness.

21:20.154 --> 21:24.239
And so we meet at last
you evil little rodent.

21:24.241 --> 21:30.080
A great and long overdue
displeasure, don't you find?

21:30.080 --> 21:32.748
Why do you hate the Nice Side
so much?

21:32.750 --> 21:36.460
If you must know, because
the Nice Side Warriors

21:36.462 --> 21:38.546
never accepted me.

21:38.548 --> 21:41.757
You wanted to be a part
of the Nice Side Warriors?

21:41.759 --> 21:43.926
Of course I did.

21:43.928 --> 21:46.679
Doesn't every animal
in the Zooverse?

21:46.681 --> 21:50.767
Doesn't every colt, lamb,
and cub dream of becoming

21:50.769 --> 21:53.143
a Nice Side Warrior?

21:53.145 --> 21:55.395
I suppose they do.

21:55.397 --> 21:59.984
They thought I was nothing
but a puny little mouse.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.487
So I found somebody else
who was willing to train me

22:02.489 --> 22:04.490
in the way of the Sauce.

22:05.575 --> 22:07.949
And now I will use my
Sauce powers to take over

22:07.951 --> 22:09.537
the entire Zooverse.

22:10.413 --> 22:11.578
The Sauce?

22:11.580 --> 22:14.498
Surely you don't mean
the marinara.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.499
No.

22:15.501 --> 22:17.211
I mean all the Sauce.

22:18.253 --> 22:19.170
All of it.

22:19.172 --> 22:21.756
Marinara, Tabasco, Ragu.

22:21.758 --> 22:24.007
No, it cannot be.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.761
But it is, Princess.

22:26.721 --> 22:28.554
With the power of the Sauce
you could...

22:28.556 --> 22:31.474
Wipe out the entire
Zooverse and the Nice Side

22:31.476 --> 22:33.267
along with it?

22:33.269 --> 22:35.018
What do you want from me?

22:35.020 --> 22:37.022
I seek the Chosen One.

22:38.817 --> 22:40.357
The Chosen One?

22:40.359 --> 22:43.486
For as long as he stands,
I cannot conquer the entire

22:43.488 --> 22:45.240
Zooverse unopposed.

22:46.574 --> 22:51.246
You must tell me where
to find him.

22:51.246 --> 22:54.205
I would never tell you, Boo
Boo Squeal.

22:54.207 --> 22:55.208
Fine them.

22:56.584 --> 23:00.337
I shall use my power of the
Sauce to read your mind.

23:03.758 --> 23:04.673
No!

23:04.675 --> 23:07.468
Look at me,
Princess Sparklefeather.

23:07.470 --> 23:11.891
Look into my infinitely
evil eyes.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.266
No.

23:13.268 --> 23:14.269
Remolaude.

23:15.144 --> 23:15.936
No, no!

23:17.105 --> 23:19.980
Where is the Chosen One?

23:19.982 --> 23:21.024
Never.

23:21.026 --> 23:22.941
Hoisin sauce.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.152
No, not Hoisin.

23:25.154 --> 23:26.696
Teriyaki.

23:26.698 --> 23:28.490
Oh, no.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.533
Your power is strong.

23:30.535 --> 23:34.580
Alfredo.

23:34.580 --> 23:37.498
The Chosen One, Princess?

23:37.500 --> 23:39.419
No, never.

23:39.419 --> 23:40.668
Where is he?

23:40.670 --> 23:43.379
Your Sauce power shall
not prevail.

23:43.381 --> 23:44.257
Marinara.

23:45.174 --> 23:47.132
Not the marinara.

23:47.134 --> 23:48.345
Vodka sauce.

23:50.721 --> 23:51.511
No.

23:51.513 --> 23:57.644
Guacamole.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.732
Whoa, that was something
wasn't it?

24:03.734 --> 24:06.526
Nah, just a day in the
life of me.

24:06.528 --> 24:08.112
Squeezy Whistle?

24:08.114 --> 24:10.238
Yours must be an
incredible life.

24:10.240 --> 24:13.325
Eh, risk, adventure, peril.

24:13.327 --> 24:15.411
That's just the bread and Brazil
nuts of a

24:15.413 --> 24:16.578
rogue space squirrel.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.373
Nothing much to it.

24:18.375 --> 24:20.708
Oh, galactic tusks.

24:20.710 --> 24:22.543
This is the life I've
always dreamed about.

24:22.545 --> 24:24.253
Hey, this ain't a life fit for

24:24.255 --> 24:26.296
every space animal out there.

24:26.298 --> 24:29.342
You can't just wish a life
of adventure, peanuts.

24:29.344 --> 24:30.884
You gotta be cut out for it.

24:30.886 --> 24:34.889
Yeah, you gotta be made
of the right mixed nuts.

24:34.891 --> 24:36.349
You think I could...

24:36.351 --> 24:37.557
No.

24:37.559 --> 24:38.892
Aww.

24:38.894 --> 24:42.563
Eh, a lifetime of pencil
pushin's made you soft in

24:42.565 --> 24:44.649
the gut, peanuts.

24:44.651 --> 24:47.235
I suggest you return
to your life,

24:47.237 --> 24:49.612
and forget all
about this mission.

24:49.614 --> 24:51.698
And about Princess
Sparklefeather.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.282
Why do you dislike
Princess Sparklefeather

24:53.284 --> 24:54.616
so much, Squeezy?

24:54.618 --> 24:55.701
What has she ever done to you?

24:55.703 --> 24:58.161
Eh, we loved each other, once.

24:58.163 --> 24:58.955
What?

24:58.957 --> 25:00.206
What?

25:00.208 --> 25:01.958
You and the Princess?

25:01.960 --> 25:04.669
Hey, it was never gonna work,
alright?

25:04.671 --> 25:07.546
Me, a lonely park squirrel
from the Lower East Quadrant.

25:07.548 --> 25:09.673
She, a Princess?

25:09.675 --> 25:12.176
Imagine the scene at a
family event, will ya?

25:12.178 --> 25:14.511
Bunch of elephants cowering
on backward tables,

25:14.513 --> 25:17.640
shrieking in horror at the
sight of my rodent family.

25:17.642 --> 25:19.767
Eh, it was just never
gonna work.

25:20.979 --> 25:22.687
You are the reason
the Princess never found

25:22.689 --> 25:24.771
a suitable husband.

25:24.773 --> 25:26.024
Oh, she never married?

25:26.026 --> 25:28.484
No, she met hundreds
of suitors,

25:28.486 --> 25:30.864
and discarded them one by one.

25:31.740 --> 25:35.699
Nobody seemed to be good
enough to be her prince.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.744
Ah, Princess.

25:37.746 --> 25:42.039
Is she the reason you left
the Mice Side and went rogue?

25:42.041 --> 25:43.708
Yeah, that's right.

25:43.710 --> 25:46.209
I couldn't pledge allegiance
to a leader who wanted

25:46.211 --> 25:48.755
to harm Princess Sparklefeather.

25:48.757 --> 25:52.132
Oh, this must be why
the Princess recorded

25:52.134 --> 25:53.718
a message for you.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.678
She knew you would help.

25:57.015 --> 26:00.557
The Princess recorded a
message for me?

26:00.559 --> 26:03.061
Why, for all the pine nuts in
the galaxy,

26:03.063 --> 26:04.687
didn't you tell me before?

26:04.689 --> 26:06.689
Oh, helium no.

26:06.691 --> 26:10.942
I know you didn't just
squeak at me, squirrel form.

26:10.944 --> 26:13.112
Well come on,
let's hear this message.

26:13.114 --> 26:15.864
Not if you're going
to be squeaking at me.

26:15.866 --> 26:18.492
I'm not squeaking at you.

26:18.494 --> 26:19.787
Oh yes you are.

26:20.747 --> 26:24.959
I'm not going to play the
message until you apologize.

26:25.999 --> 26:25.833
Never.

26:25.835 --> 26:27.584
Now see here.

26:27.586 --> 26:30.296
I am a very temperamental
robotic intelligent

26:30.298 --> 26:33.799
created with the highest
levels of emotional response.

26:33.801 --> 26:38.013
So apologize to me before I
press delete on this message.

26:40.767 --> 26:43.517
Squeezy Whistle, you
must apologize to U2.

26:43.519 --> 26:46.144
Or we might never know what
the Princess had to tell us.

26:46.146 --> 26:49.358
My name, for the last time,
is B-52.

26:51.694 --> 26:55.906
B stands for best, because
that is what I am, and 52

26:57.032 --> 26:59.950
is the number of times my
motherboard has experienced

26:59.952 --> 27:03.161
a complete emotional meltdown.

27:03.163 --> 27:06.915
I suggest you apologize to
me at once before I'm forced

27:06.917 --> 27:08.877
to change my name to B-53.

27:10.547 --> 27:11.548
I'm waiting.

27:12.882 --> 27:16.092
Alright fine I'll apologize,
but Princess Sparklefeather's

27:16.094 --> 27:18.052
gonna hear about this.

27:18.054 --> 27:19.556
Any minute now.

27:20.682 --> 27:21.473
I-I'm,

27:22.726 --> 27:23.766
I'm sorry.

27:23.768 --> 27:24.728
Sorry about?

27:25.811 --> 27:29.146
I'm sorry I squeaked at you,
Sum 41.

27:29.148 --> 27:30.856
I'll never do it again.

27:30.858 --> 27:35.363
What did you call me?

28:00.055 --> 28:02.430
Squeezy Whistle, if
you get this message,

28:02.432 --> 28:04.806
I've been captured by the
Mice Side under express order

28:04.808 --> 28:06.517
from Boo Boo Squeal.

28:06.519 --> 28:08.603
You're the only one I can trust.

28:08.605 --> 28:09.396
Wow.

28:10.647 --> 28:12.565
She's beautiful.

28:12.567 --> 28:15.901
Hey, you keep your tongue
between your tusks, Nuke.

28:15.903 --> 28:18.363
She's a Princess, not your kind.

28:18.365 --> 28:20.782
What do you know
about my kind?

28:20.784 --> 28:23.867
Oh yeah, well I know you're
nothing but a long nosed,

28:23.869 --> 28:25.786
goofy-toothed, peanut chompin'...

28:25.788 --> 28:26.871
Shh.

28:26.873 --> 28:28.789
The Princess is talking.

28:28.791 --> 28:31.542
I must tell you about
the Chosen One, Squeezy.

28:31.544 --> 28:32.543
Whoa.

28:32.545 --> 28:33.753
The Chosen One?

28:33.755 --> 28:34.879
Shh.

28:34.881 --> 28:37.798
He is said to be a very
special kind of animal.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.176
He was raised by the leader
of the Nice Side Warriors.

28:40.178 --> 28:42.844
He was trained to wield the
full power of the sauce.

28:42.846 --> 28:45.555
No other space animal can
defeat him,

28:45.557 --> 28:47.432
not even Boo Boo Squeal.

28:47.434 --> 28:50.018
Eh, the Chosen One is
just a myth.

28:50.020 --> 28:50.812
You mean a legend.

28:50.814 --> 28:53.980
Myth, legend, whatever.

28:53.982 --> 28:54.940
Not the same thing.

28:54.942 --> 28:57.276
In fact, a myth is a
unverifiable story handed

28:57.278 --> 28:59.946
down by tradition from earlier
times and popularly accepted

28:59.948 --> 29:01.488
as historical.

29:01.490 --> 29:03.574
A legend, on the other hand,
is an imaginary, or fictitious,

29:03.576 --> 29:05.034
thing or person.

29:05.036 --> 29:06.994
Oh for chestnut's sake.

29:06.996 --> 29:08.996
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

29:08.998 --> 29:11.373
Now that Boo Boo Squeal
has destroyed the Nice Side

29:11.375 --> 29:14.835
and captured me, he will turn
his teeny-tiny beady eyes

29:14.837 --> 29:16.837
towards Zoobar's domination.

29:16.839 --> 29:19.882
But he can never be sure
the Chosen One will not

29:19.884 --> 29:20.842
try to stop him.

29:20.844 --> 29:22.427
My tusks.

29:22.429 --> 29:24.261
The Chosen One is the coolest
space animal

29:24.263 --> 29:25.971
I've ever heard of.

29:25.973 --> 29:27.765
- A myth.
- Legend.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.100
Shh.

29:29.102 --> 29:30.809
Boo Boo Squeal will stop
at nothing to find out

29:30.811 --> 29:32.437
where the Chosen One is.

29:32.439 --> 29:33.478
Whoa.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.690
He will try to use
the power of the Sauce

29:35.692 --> 29:37.150
to bend me to his will.

29:37.152 --> 29:39.943
A Nice Side Princess, I
was trained to withstand

29:39.945 --> 29:42.071
the power of the Sauce,
but I don't know how long

29:42.073 --> 29:43.989
I can last against
Boo Boo Squeal.

29:43.991 --> 29:45.866
He's very powerful.

29:45.868 --> 29:48.076
My galactic flapping ears.

29:48.078 --> 29:50.621
Squeezy
Whistle, I need your help.

29:50.623 --> 29:52.248
Okay, let's hear it, Princess.

29:52.250 --> 29:53.999
I need you to find the
leader of

29:54.001 --> 29:55.500
the Nice Side Warriors.

29:55.502 --> 29:57.586
He will introduce you to the
Chosen One,

29:57.588 --> 30:00.047
the only one who can
save us all.

30:00.049 --> 30:01.632
Whoa.

30:01.634 --> 30:05.053
Please, Squeezey Whistle,
seek Bongo Bananas.

30:05.055 --> 30:07.138
He will lead you to the
Chosen One.

30:07.140 --> 30:08.014
Wait, what?

30:08.016 --> 30:10.141
Did she say Bongo Bananas?

30:10.143 --> 30:12.934
The last of the
Nice Side Warriors.

30:12.936 --> 30:14.394
I know him.

30:14.396 --> 30:17.940
My trusted robot, UB-40, has
the coordinates to find him.

30:18.984 --> 30:20.817
What did she call me?

30:20.819 --> 30:21.986
I know him.

30:21.988 --> 30:23.363
I know Bongo Bananas.

30:23.365 --> 30:26.114
You know Bongo Bananas?

30:26.116 --> 30:28.742
Oh that's a laugh and a half,
peanuts.

30:28.744 --> 30:29.786
It's true.

30:29.788 --> 30:30.952
He talks to me.

30:30.954 --> 30:33.500
Bongo Bananas talks to you?

30:34.959 --> 30:35.960
Yeah, right.

30:38.128 --> 30:39.045
He does.

30:39.047 --> 30:41.463
Tell him, tell him that
Bongo Bananas talks to me.

30:41.465 --> 30:42.965
Negative, carbon.

30:42.967 --> 30:45.093
I am not privy to that data.

30:45.095 --> 30:47.594
How do you think I got into
your ship?

30:47.596 --> 30:49.764
Uh, solar winds?

30:49.766 --> 30:50.972
What? No.

30:50.974 --> 30:52.642
It was Bongo Bananas.

30:52.644 --> 30:54.977
He told me to hit enter
and then...

30:54.979 --> 30:56.938
Hey you got me mixed
up in a pistachio

30:56.940 --> 30:58.855
of a mess elephant.

30:58.857 --> 30:59.649
Me?

30:59.651 --> 31:00.941
Yeah, you.

31:00.943 --> 31:02.985
But, but I didn't do anything.

31:02.987 --> 31:04.946
I was sitting at my desk
when I got teleported

31:04.948 --> 31:08.240
into the Sparkle Express by
Bongo Bananas.

31:08.242 --> 31:09.491
Enough.

31:09.493 --> 31:12.077
But, but, but...

31:12.079 --> 31:13.412
Ah, shucks.

31:13.414 --> 31:16.082
I'm afraid this is where
we part ways, peanuts.

31:16.084 --> 31:19.751
You go back home where
you belong while I...

31:19.753 --> 31:21.170
What are you going to do?

31:21.172 --> 31:24.172
Eh, what I always do, peanuts.

31:24.174 --> 31:25.757
Run.

31:25.759 --> 31:28.094
You can't just run, Squeezy.

31:28.096 --> 31:29.720
Yeah, well watch me.

31:29.722 --> 31:32.974
I've docketed the next station
and you can hitch a ride

31:32.976 --> 31:36.393
back to your cubicle desk
job on Zootrini.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.520
But we have to do something.

31:38.522 --> 31:39.604
The Princess said...

31:39.606 --> 31:42.232
Yeah, I heard what the
Princess said.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.526
But this ain't my fight.

31:44.528 --> 31:47.071
Your walnuts are still raw
from losing her, Squeezy.

31:47.073 --> 31:50.824
Hey, my walnuts are just fine,
Dr. Phil.

31:50.826 --> 31:52.117
- It's just that...
- What?

31:52.119 --> 31:55.246
Eh, I'm tired of
all the fighting.

31:55.248 --> 31:57.289
You have to take a stand,
Squeezy.

31:57.291 --> 31:59.875
You have to decide if you
are with the Nice Side,

31:59.877 --> 32:02.128
or the Mice Side.

32:02.130 --> 32:04.255
I have no sides.

32:04.257 --> 32:07.592
This is one fight you
must take on, Squeezy.

32:07.594 --> 32:09.844
You just wanna go on a
space adventure,

32:09.846 --> 32:11.054
don't you, peanuts?

32:11.056 --> 32:12.971
Yeah, yeah I do.

32:12.973 --> 32:15.099
Sorry, no can do.

32:15.101 --> 32:17.434
I wanna meet Bongo Bananas.

32:17.436 --> 32:18.771
Why ever for?

32:19.564 --> 32:20.729
Because.

32:20.731 --> 32:23.149
Because he spoke to me.

32:23.151 --> 32:24.359
He told me that if I hit enter,

32:24.361 --> 32:27.027
I would learn the truth,
and I still don't know

32:27.029 --> 32:28.321
what the truth is.

32:28.323 --> 32:30.489
Eh, I'm afraid that you might
never know

32:30.491 --> 32:33.034
this truth you speak of,
peanuts.

32:33.036 --> 32:34.076
Why not?

32:34.078 --> 32:37.246
'Cause Bongo Bananas
is no longer with us,

32:37.248 --> 32:39.623
and I hardly doubt he's
been communicating from

32:39.625 --> 32:42.834
his final galactic resting
place with a peanut chomper

32:42.836 --> 32:44.836
from Planet Zootrini.

32:44.838 --> 32:45.921
No offense.

32:45.923 --> 32:47.090
It can't be.

32:47.092 --> 32:49.007
Bongo Bananas spoke to me.

32:49.009 --> 32:51.177
You must believe me.

32:51.179 --> 32:52.511
Hey.

32:52.513 --> 32:55.890
I saw Bongo Bananas get
sucked into a black hole.

32:55.892 --> 32:58.183
Nothing survives that.

32:58.185 --> 32:59.518
Nothin'.

32:59.520 --> 33:00.937
You know what I think?

33:00.939 --> 33:03.189
I think that a lifetime of
running has made you soft

33:03.191 --> 33:05.107
in the pistachios, Squeezy.

33:05.109 --> 33:08.361
My pistachios are rock hard.

33:08.363 --> 33:11.948
I've chipped incisors on
those pistachios.

33:11.950 --> 33:13.157
Prove it.

33:13.159 --> 33:14.199
Hey, I'll tell you what.

33:14.201 --> 33:17.953
I know someone who can
help us sort all this out.

33:17.955 --> 33:20.040
His name is Jabber the Jaw.

33:21.291 --> 33:22.499
Jabber the Jaw?

33:22.501 --> 33:23.959
Yeah.

33:23.961 --> 33:27.087
He's big in the underground
world of kangaroo boxing.

33:27.089 --> 33:29.548
Got his hooves on a
little bit of everything.

33:29.550 --> 33:34.261
Yeah, if something's worth
knowing, Jabber knows about it.

33:34.263 --> 33:37.766
He'll know if Bongo
Bananas is still alive.

33:39.059 --> 33:41.059
Let's go see him then.

33:41.061 --> 33:43.312
Eh fine, but just be aware.

33:43.314 --> 33:45.189
Jabber the Jaw's a little odd.

33:45.191 --> 33:46.401
How is that?

33:47.359 --> 33:50.111
Eh, he speaks of himself
in the third animal,

33:50.113 --> 33:52.988
and he really loves his
space calypso tunes.

33:52.990 --> 33:55.365
But just ignore all that.

33:55.367 --> 33:56.950
Now you keep your flapping
trunk still

33:56.952 --> 34:00.246
and you let me do the talking.

34:00.248 --> 34:04.875
Carbon-based, that was
an emotional rollercoaster.

34:04.877 --> 34:06.001
Oh.

34:06.003 --> 34:08.838
I'm glad we went
through it together.

34:08.840 --> 34:10.715
Let's hold hands?

34:10.717 --> 34:12.175
Oh shut up.

34:12.177 --> 34:13.135
Ah, shut up.

34:17.181 --> 34:20.224
You must have run out of
sauce by now, Boo Boo Squeal.

34:20.226 --> 34:21.726
You just must have.

34:21.728 --> 34:23.101
Never!

34:23.103 --> 34:26.732
In fact, what about some
Cincinnati Chili, Princess?

34:28.233 --> 34:30.568
No, it cannot be.

34:30.570 --> 34:34.783
I got as much sauce power
as you got time, Princess.

34:36.284 --> 34:39.034
I have underestimated
you, Boo Boo Squeal.

34:39.036 --> 34:41.371
You are indeed terribly
powerful.

34:41.373 --> 34:44.125
More powerful than the
Chosen One?

34:45.335 --> 34:48.378
Oh, the Chosen One is
much more powerful than you,

34:48.380 --> 34:49.420
Boo Boo Squeal.

34:49.422 --> 34:51.672
Squeezy Whistle will find him
and then...

34:51.675 --> 34:55.679
Squeezy Whistle is
looking for the Chosen One?

34:56.971 --> 34:58.679
That's good to know, Princess.

34:58.681 --> 35:02.182
He will lead me right to the
Chosen One.

35:02.184 --> 35:03.601
No!

35:03.603 --> 35:07.188
And once he does,

35:07.190 --> 35:11.110
I will destroy both of them.

35:19.869 --> 35:24.037
We're approaching Jabber the
Jaw's lair.

35:24.039 --> 35:26.833
Now, peanuts, you keep
your eyes between

35:26.835 --> 35:31.003
your floppy ears and keep
your trunk on silent mode.

35:31.005 --> 35:33.380
I'll deal with him, capisce?

35:33.382 --> 35:34.174
Capisce.

35:36.594 --> 35:39.387
Hello there, Squeezy Whistle.

35:39.389 --> 35:40.637
Oh yeah?

35:40.639 --> 35:43.224
Well who in the space
sunflower seeds are you?

35:43.226 --> 35:46.061
I am Tartar the Third.

35:46.061 --> 35:51.275
Mighty galactic warrior and
part time orthodontic student.

35:51.275 --> 35:53.818
I have come to destroy you.

35:53.820 --> 35:55.445
And your ship.

35:55.447 --> 35:59.115
Hey, why such animosity
ugly face?

35:59.117 --> 36:00.407
Can we talk it out?

36:00.409 --> 36:01.200
Me?

36:01.202 --> 36:01.995
Ugly face?

36:03.371 --> 36:04.456
You, ugly face.

36:07.541 --> 36:11.251
Brains the size of a walnut,
these guys.

36:11.253 --> 36:15.505
No sense of humor and absolutely
no swank.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.967
That might be but he
seems pretty gung ho about

36:17.969 --> 36:20.010
destroying the Cashew,
Squeezy Whistle.

36:20.012 --> 36:21.304
What are we gonna do?

36:21.306 --> 36:23.847
Watch and learn peanuts.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.474
Hey, ugly face.

36:25.476 --> 36:27.184
Look, over there.

36:27.186 --> 36:28.186
Huh, what?

36:28.188 --> 36:29.269
Where?

36:29.271 --> 36:31.356
Engage
thermal blasters.

36:31.358 --> 36:33.566
Thermal blasters
engaged.

36:33.568 --> 36:36.403
Thermo-what-now?

36:36.403 --> 36:38.570
Oh, that's gonna...

36:38.572 --> 36:39.365
Hurt.

36:58.592 --> 37:01.469
Now here's Jabber's planet.

37:01.471 --> 37:06.226
Now, remember, Nuke, you
let me do the talking.

37:31.543 --> 37:32.626
Jabber the Jaw.

37:34.003 --> 37:35.670
Nice to see you my friend.

37:35.672 --> 37:37.380
Jabber has no friends.

37:37.382 --> 37:40.340
You must keep your visit
brief, as Jabber has business

37:40.342 --> 37:41.342
to attend to.

37:41.344 --> 37:43.677
You got five cosmic seconds.

37:43.679 --> 37:47.349
Eh, five cosmic seconds,
10 cosmic seconds.

37:48.559 --> 37:51.394
I don't count time
anymore Jabber.

37:51.396 --> 37:53.311
I count emotions.

37:53.313 --> 37:55.313
I can respect that, Squeeze.

37:55.315 --> 37:56.398
Word.

37:56.400 --> 37:57.358
Can we get to the point?

37:57.360 --> 37:59.485
Now what do you seek
from Jabber?

37:59.487 --> 38:01.487
Help us find Bongo Bananas.

38:01.489 --> 38:03.907
Did you say Bongo Bananas?

38:04.992 --> 38:09.494
Hey, I told you to let
me do the talking, peanuts.

38:09.496 --> 38:12.373
What do you want from
Bongo Bananas?

38:12.375 --> 38:14.374
I need to see him.

38:16.295 --> 38:18.503
I guess you two didn't
get the memo.

38:18.505 --> 38:20.255
Bongo Bananas is...

38:20.257 --> 38:21.215
Dead.

38:21.217 --> 38:22.550
Dead?

38:22.552 --> 38:25.052
Oh no, he's very much alive.

38:25.054 --> 38:27.554
What are you jabbering about,
Jaw?

38:27.556 --> 38:28.680
You heard me, squirrel.

38:28.682 --> 38:31.309
Bongo Bananas is alive.

38:31.311 --> 38:33.101
We must find him.

38:33.103 --> 38:35.438
Ooo, you won't find him
so easily.

38:35.440 --> 38:36.606
Why?

38:36.608 --> 38:39.441
He's left this
dimension a long time ago.

38:39.443 --> 38:41.193
He's been in hiding.

38:41.195 --> 38:43.945
He's the greatest
warrior of the Nice Side.

38:43.947 --> 38:47.826
Why would such a powerful
warrior need to hide?

38:48.661 --> 38:50.912
His old age must have
caught up with him.

38:50.914 --> 38:54.206
So he just abandoned the
Nice Side?

38:54.208 --> 38:57.626
From what I heard, he trained
two very special animals

38:57.628 --> 39:00.338
to take his place when the
time came.

39:00.340 --> 39:03.132
But alas, they both
deserted him.

39:03.134 --> 39:04.675
But what about the Princess?

39:04.677 --> 39:05.677
The Nice Side?

39:05.679 --> 39:07.010
The Zooverse?

39:07.012 --> 39:08.054
Is it all lost?

39:08.056 --> 39:10.472
All that Jabber the Jaw can
tell you

39:10.474 --> 39:13.726
is that Bongo Bananas
plans to remain in hiding

39:13.728 --> 39:17.188
in a parallel dimension
until the return of...

39:17.190 --> 39:18.856
The Chosen One.

39:18.858 --> 39:20.983
The Chosen One.

39:20.985 --> 39:22.651
Exactly.

39:22.653 --> 39:25.530
The Chosen One is the
Nice Side's only hope.

39:25.532 --> 39:29.659
Bongo Bananas is waiting to
reunite with him at last.

39:29.661 --> 39:31.744
We need to find Bongo Bananas
at once.

39:31.746 --> 39:34.956
The Princess, the Chosen One,
my destiny.

39:34.958 --> 39:38.458
You'd have to access an
alternate dimension, pachyderm.

39:38.460 --> 39:41.003
Not an easy feat if you don't
know how.

39:41.005 --> 39:42.796
There's gotta be a way.

39:42.798 --> 39:44.590
Why don't we ask him?

39:44.592 --> 39:45.675
Ask who?

39:45.677 --> 39:46.925
Bongo Bananas of course.

39:46.927 --> 39:48.927
I told you, he talks to me.

39:48.929 --> 39:49.806
Nonsense.

39:51.141 --> 39:53.432
Hey, peanut face here
might be on to somethin'.

39:53.434 --> 39:54.516
Hey come on now, Jabba.

39:54.518 --> 39:56.644
This elephant speaks crazy.

39:56.646 --> 39:59.396
Ooo, I like him, let's
give peanuts a shot.

39:59.398 --> 40:00.690
Ah, fine.

40:00.692 --> 40:01.733
Go ahead, peanuts.

40:01.735 --> 40:03.528
Talk to Bongo Bananas.

40:04.612 --> 40:06.153
Bongo?

40:06.155 --> 40:07.738
Hello?

40:07.740 --> 40:08.949
It's me, Nuke.

40:15.081 --> 40:19.083
Uh, I think your inter
dimensional communication device

40:19.085 --> 40:21.376
has failed you, peanuts.

40:22.547 --> 40:24.713
Give him another
chance, Squeezy Whistle.

40:24.715 --> 40:27.008
The pachyderm has chutzpah.

40:27.010 --> 40:28.217
Fine.

40:28.219 --> 40:29.012
Um.

40:30.387 --> 40:31.720
Uh, Bongo?

40:31.722 --> 40:32.597
It's me, Nuke.

40:32.599 --> 40:33.639
Remember me?

40:33.641 --> 40:35.599
You told me I needed to
find my destiny.

40:35.601 --> 40:37.226
You said I should know
the truth.

40:37.228 --> 40:38.686
And now, here I am.

40:38.688 --> 40:39.479
I'm ready.

40:39.481 --> 40:41.606
Ready to know it all.

40:50.574 --> 40:52.032
Okay, that does it.

40:52.034 --> 40:54.659
This fantasy trip is over,
peanuts.

40:54.661 --> 40:56.537
I'm taking you back to...

40:56.539 --> 40:58.246
Hello, Nuke.

40:58.248 --> 41:00.749
Whoa, Bongo, is it really you?

41:00.751 --> 41:02.168
It is I.

41:02.170 --> 41:04.380
Bongo Bananas?

41:04.380 --> 41:08.548
The Princess, she's in grave
danger and we need your help.

41:08.550 --> 41:10.050
I know all about.

41:10.052 --> 41:12.177
That's why I sent for you, Nuke.

41:12.179 --> 41:14.222
And you Squeezy Whistle.

41:14.224 --> 41:18.392
You're my only hope to
finally defeat Boo Boo Squeal.

41:18.394 --> 41:19.267
Us?

41:19.269 --> 41:20.894
Me and Squeezy Whistle?

41:20.896 --> 41:23.106
Squeezy Whistle and me?

41:23.108 --> 41:24.190
Yes.

41:24.192 --> 41:25.941
Both of you must come to me.

41:25.943 --> 41:26.943
Whoa.

41:26.945 --> 41:28.068
Galactic tusks.

41:28.070 --> 41:30.572
We're on our way.

41:30.572 --> 41:34.242
Wait, where are you and
how do we get there?

41:34.244 --> 41:35.702
You know the way,
Nuke.

41:35.704 --> 41:36.744
Me?

41:36.746 --> 41:39.287
You must remember,
Nuke.

41:39.289 --> 41:40.083
Remember.

41:41.918 --> 41:43.126
Remember what?

41:43.128 --> 41:45.420
I can't remember a thing
I did a minute ago.

41:45.422 --> 41:46.963
Eh, you're an elephant.

41:46.965 --> 41:49.507
Ain't you supposed to
have an amazing memory?

41:49.509 --> 41:50.298
Sorry.

41:50.300 --> 41:51.592
I have a terrible memory.

41:51.594 --> 41:52.844
What can I say?

41:52.846 --> 41:55.722
Remember, Nuke.

41:55.724 --> 41:56.516
Remember.

41:58.309 --> 42:01.309
Hey, whatever it is you must
remember,

42:01.311 --> 42:04.604
just remember it, will you,
Nuke?

42:04.606 --> 42:07.358
Well I can't remember what
I'm supposed to remember.

42:07.360 --> 42:09.735
For all the stars in
the galaxy, pachyderm,

42:09.737 --> 42:12.030
will you just remember already?

42:12.032 --> 42:14.322
You have outstayed
Jabber the Jaw's welcome

42:14.324 --> 42:16.035
by seven cosmic ions.

42:16.994 --> 42:19.287
I...

42:19.289 --> 42:21.246
I can't remember a thing.

42:21.248 --> 42:23.749
Remember, Nuke.

42:23.751 --> 42:25.001
Bongo?

42:25.003 --> 42:25.879
Aw, shucks.

42:26.755 --> 42:27.836
Oh come on, what is it?

42:27.838 --> 42:29.338
What are you supposed
to remember?

42:29.340 --> 42:30.505
I don't know.

42:30.507 --> 42:31.840
Is it a code?

42:31.842 --> 42:32.633
I don't think so.

42:32.635 --> 42:34.137
A phone number?

42:35.096 --> 42:35.927
Nope.

42:35.929 --> 42:37.387
An address?

42:37.389 --> 42:39.599
Uh, I don't believe it is.

42:39.601 --> 42:41.767
A lock combination?

42:41.769 --> 42:42.976
Nope.

42:42.978 --> 42:44.519
More like a condiment.

42:44.521 --> 42:45.396
Ragu?

42:45.398 --> 42:46.229
No.

42:46.231 --> 42:47.273
Alfredo.

42:47.275 --> 42:48.441
Uh, nope.

42:48.443 --> 42:49.608
Peanut sauce?

42:49.610 --> 42:51.360
That sounds divine.

42:51.362 --> 42:54.697
But no, it's not peanut sauce.

42:56.867 --> 42:58.950
Tartar reporting on
the "Destroy the Cashew

42:58.952 --> 43:01.287
"and return triumphant" mission.

43:01.289 --> 43:02.374
Ah, Tartar.

43:03.625 --> 43:07.001
I trust you bring me great news.

43:07.003 --> 43:09.045
Tell me, my trusty Tartar.

43:09.047 --> 43:12.507
Have you destroyed the Cashew
and that silly squirrel

43:12.509 --> 43:13.800
along with it?

43:13.802 --> 43:15.885
Uh, Boo Boo?

43:15.887 --> 43:19.847
I'm afraid I'm the
bringer of nefarious news.

43:19.849 --> 43:21.057
Are you saying?

43:21.059 --> 43:22.724
I'm saying...

43:22.726 --> 43:27.815
You, the proud space
warrior, Tartar the Third,

43:27.815 --> 43:32.025
son of Tartar the Second, and
grandson of the first Tartar,

43:32.027 --> 43:35.614
not able to defeat a
puny park squirrel from

43:36.990 --> 43:39.282
the Lower East Quadrant?

43:39.284 --> 43:41.954
Alas, it is so,
Boo Boo Squeal.

43:45.333 --> 43:50.005
That makes me very, very
angry, Tartar.

43:50.005 --> 43:51.253
Uh oh.

43:51.255 --> 43:54.882
So angry, in fact, I
might be forced to use

43:54.884 --> 43:58.512
the power of the Sauce upon you.

43:58.512 --> 44:00.804
No, not the Sauce!

44:00.806 --> 44:02.391
Indeed, the Sauce.

44:03.518 --> 44:07.228
May my power of the Sauce
blast you a million ions

44:07.230 --> 44:10.817
into the farthest space
DIMENSION: Marinara!

44:19.867 --> 44:23.494
Looks like I'm surrounded
by imbeciles.

44:23.496 --> 44:24.287
Chubby.

44:24.289 --> 44:25.204
Yes, Boo Boo?

44:25.206 --> 44:27.081
Prepare the Boo Boo Ship.

44:27.083 --> 44:29.166
It's time to send out the
best warrior

44:29.168 --> 44:31.836
in the Zooverse to defeat
Squeezy Whistle,

44:31.838 --> 44:33.590
and the Chosen One.

44:34.465 --> 44:35.965
Oh goody.

44:35.967 --> 44:37.342
And who's that?

44:37.344 --> 44:39.385
Me, you silly pachyderm.

44:39.387 --> 44:40.219
Oh.

44:40.221 --> 44:41.014
Right.

44:42.139 --> 44:43.764
Bolognese?

44:43.766 --> 44:44.724
No.

44:44.726 --> 44:45.974
Marinara?

44:45.976 --> 44:46.934
No.

44:46.936 --> 44:47.976
Margherita?

44:47.978 --> 44:48.769
No.

44:48.771 --> 44:51.396
Uh, Ragu, Sauce Ragu.

44:51.398 --> 44:52.815
Is it Sauce Ragu?

44:52.817 --> 44:53.816
Nope.

44:53.818 --> 44:54.816
Ratatouille?

44:54.818 --> 44:55.860
Nope.

44:55.862 --> 44:57.028
Wait, I got it.

44:57.030 --> 44:58.862
Really?

44:58.864 --> 45:00.822
Oh, no, never mind.

45:00.824 --> 45:03.284
Oh for chestnut's sake.

45:03.286 --> 45:04.494
Oh, wait.

45:04.496 --> 45:05.869
What?

45:05.871 --> 45:06.871
I got it.

45:06.873 --> 45:08.581
Really, this time?

45:08.583 --> 45:11.876
Yeah, hold tight to your
fluffy tail, Squeezy Whistle.

45:11.878 --> 45:14.295
The word I'm supposed to
remember is...

45:14.297 --> 45:16.588
Why should I hold onto
my fluffy...

45:16.590 --> 45:17.509
Bechamel!

45:32.731 --> 45:34.773
Amazing space tusks.

45:34.775 --> 45:35.650
Is this?

45:35.652 --> 45:36.820
Bongo Bananas.

45:38.612 --> 45:39.405
It is I.

45:41.449 --> 45:42.242
Whoa.

45:46.829 --> 45:50.164
At last you have come,
my elephant friend.

45:50.166 --> 45:51.206
I've had help.

45:51.208 --> 45:52.958
This here is Squeezy Whistle
and he...

45:52.960 --> 45:54.461
I know who he is.

45:55.380 --> 45:58.588
We know each other very well.

45:58.590 --> 46:00.298
Don't we, Squeezy?

46:00.300 --> 46:03.344
Yeah, you and I go
way back, Bongo Bananas.

46:03.346 --> 46:04.679
Way back.

46:04.681 --> 46:08.391
To the days of the
Nice Side Warriors.

46:08.393 --> 46:10.603
- To the day...
- We battled.

46:11.396 --> 46:13.854
You two battled each other?

46:13.856 --> 46:16.983
I thought I had defeated
you, Bongo Bananas.

46:16.985 --> 46:20.238
I saw you being sucked into a
black hole.

46:21.197 --> 46:23.363
But here you are.

46:23.365 --> 46:25.782
It takes more than
a little park squirrel

46:25.784 --> 46:29.871
from the Lower East Quadrant
to defeat Bongo Bananas.

46:29.873 --> 46:30.914
Alas.

46:31.498 --> 46:35.961
I hear you defected to the
Mice Side.

46:35.961 --> 46:39.463
I couldn't find it in
my heart to fight anymore.

46:39.465 --> 46:41.298
I sought freedom.

46:41.300 --> 46:42.633
Whoa.

46:42.635 --> 46:43.885
Bongo Bananas, aren't you
sore at Squeezy Whistle

46:43.887 --> 46:45.845
for sending you into a
black hole?

46:45.847 --> 46:48.139
Au contraire,
my elephant friend.

46:48.141 --> 46:52.726
It was the perfect opportunity
to fake my own demise.

46:52.728 --> 46:57.481
Boo Boo Squeal had grown
to strong, even for me.

46:57.483 --> 47:00.735
I've been waiting in the
shadows for the perfect moment

47:00.737 --> 47:02.528
to strike back.

47:02.530 --> 47:06.699
To bring the galaxy back to
a time when the Mice Side

47:06.701 --> 47:09.159
and the Nice Side got along.

47:09.161 --> 47:10.579
A time of peace.

47:12.623 --> 47:16.208
Wait, the Mice Side and
the Nice Side got along?

47:16.210 --> 47:17.001
Yeah.

47:17.003 --> 47:18.920
That's a long time ago.

47:18.922 --> 47:22.632
A time before you were even
born, Squeezy.

47:22.634 --> 47:24.675
That's impossible.

47:24.677 --> 47:28.429
The Nice Side and the Mice
Side are sworn enemies.

47:28.431 --> 47:32.182
There was a time when all
the animals in the Zooverse

47:32.184 --> 47:33.728
lived in harmony.

47:35.063 --> 47:36.521
What happened?

47:36.523 --> 47:38.981
I accepted a traitor
in our midst.

47:38.983 --> 47:41.025
Whoa, a traitor?

47:41.027 --> 47:43.530
I took him in as if my own.

47:44.947 --> 47:46.530
He had such talent.

47:46.532 --> 47:49.869
Such abilities, such promise.

47:49.869 --> 47:55.958
But most of all, he understood
the power of the Sauce.

47:55.958 --> 47:58.003
Incredible.

47:58.003 --> 48:01.878
I trained him in the ways of
the Sauce.

48:01.880 --> 48:05.048
He quickly gained total mastery.

48:05.050 --> 48:07.260
He was my best student.

48:07.262 --> 48:09.052
Who are you talking
about Bongo?

48:09.054 --> 48:11.179
Ah, you still don't get it,
Nuke?

48:11.181 --> 48:14.141
He's talking about
Boo Boo Squeal.

48:14.143 --> 48:16.394
No Squeezy, I'm not.

48:16.396 --> 48:18.815
I'm talking about you, Nuke.

48:20.733 --> 48:25.030
Eh, well I'll be a
rotten tree trunk.

48:25.030 --> 48:26.195
Nuke?

48:26.197 --> 48:27.112
Me?

48:27.114 --> 48:29.115
It was you, Nuke.

48:29.117 --> 48:31.619
You were born of royal blood.

48:32.996 --> 48:33.788
Whoa.

48:34.998 --> 48:38.081
Brother to Princess
Sparklefeather.

48:38.083 --> 48:40.961
Whoa.

48:40.961 --> 48:44.588
You were first in line
for the Nice Side throne.

48:44.590 --> 48:49.092
Your father, the king,
entrusted your care to me before

48:49.094 --> 48:50.637
you even grew tusks.

48:53.182 --> 48:56.434
I knew you had
incredible promise.

48:56.436 --> 48:59.604
You were so bright,
Nuke, so eager.

48:59.606 --> 49:03.068
I immediately knew you
were the one and so,

49:04.193 --> 49:08.280
I began to instruct you
in the ways of the Sauce.

49:10.199 --> 49:11.449
Whoa.

49:11.451 --> 49:14.954
Just, just, whoa.

49:14.954 --> 49:16.454
Wait, this isn't possible.

49:16.456 --> 49:17.746
None of that ever happened.

49:17.748 --> 49:19.666
It did happen, my friend.

49:19.668 --> 49:21.793
Wouldn't I remember
it if it had happened?

49:21.795 --> 49:23.628
No, you would not.

49:23.630 --> 49:26.005
I made sure you wouldn't
before I released you

49:26.007 --> 49:27.673
from my charge.

49:27.675 --> 49:32.889
I used a dememorizer to
take away all your memories,

49:35.182 --> 49:38.603
all your knowledge,
and all your powers.

49:41.146 --> 49:44.065
I turned you into a blank slate,
Nuke.

49:44.067 --> 49:46.983
Just a boring old elephant dude.

49:48.070 --> 49:48.862
No way.

49:50.197 --> 49:51.697
Way.

49:51.699 --> 49:55.117
Tell me, Nuke, what do you
remember of your young years?

49:55.119 --> 49:57.577
Think, Nuke, think.

49:57.579 --> 49:58.373
I,

49:59.248 --> 50:00.289
Uh,

50:00.291 --> 50:01.666
I,

50:01.668 --> 50:03.709
I remember nothing.

50:03.711 --> 50:05.628
But, but, but why?

50:05.630 --> 50:09.132
Why did you take away my
memory, Bongo Bananas, why?

50:09.134 --> 50:12.469
Because, Nuke,
you became too strong.

50:13.679 --> 50:17.639
You became too powerful,
and your strength made you

50:17.641 --> 50:20.478
too presumptuous.

50:20.478 --> 50:23.813
You started to believe
that the power of the Sauce

50:23.815 --> 50:27.191
was for you to
wield as you pleased.

50:27.193 --> 50:29.903
And, you started to disobey me.

50:32.322 --> 50:34.117
No.

50:34.117 --> 50:35.199
Yes.

50:35.201 --> 50:40.539
You decided to harness
the Sauce for yourself.

50:40.539 --> 50:42.331
I did?

50:42.333 --> 50:45.503
Alas, Nuke, you did.

50:45.503 --> 50:49.338
You assembled an
invincible army and decided

50:49.340 --> 50:53.135
to use your powers to
rule the whole Zooverse.

50:55.929 --> 50:56.722
No way.

50:57.891 --> 51:00.349
You became unstoppable.

51:00.351 --> 51:04.313
Oh, for all the assorted
salty nuts in the universe.

51:05.940 --> 51:09.193
Thankfully, I had been
training another

51:10.362 --> 51:12.489
in the ways of the Sauce.

51:14.114 --> 51:15.740
Wait, another?

51:15.742 --> 51:16.990
Yes.

51:16.992 --> 51:19.117
Another warrior.

51:19.119 --> 51:20.369
His name was...

51:20.371 --> 51:21.873
Boo Boo Squeal.

51:23.123 --> 51:26.793
Whoa, I think my brain
is having a meltdown.

51:26.795 --> 51:30.213
He was just as talented as
you, Nuke.

51:30.215 --> 51:31.546
Just as powerful.

51:31.548 --> 51:35.762
But he was never accepted
by the Nice Side Warriors.

51:37.347 --> 51:41.559
They considered him no more
than a puny little mouse.

51:43.686 --> 51:47.396
So I trained him in secret,
and taught him everything

51:47.398 --> 51:49.233
you knew.

51:49.233 --> 51:52.651
When you betrayed me, I
unleashed him against you,

51:52.653 --> 51:54.153
Nuke, my friend.

51:54.155 --> 51:57.197
You pitted Boo Boo Squeal
against Nuke?

51:57.199 --> 51:59.659
Two of my most beloved pupils,

51:59.661 --> 52:01.411
fighting against each other.

52:01.413 --> 52:04.204
One to protect the power
of the Sauce,

52:04.206 --> 52:06.456
and one to abuse it.

52:06.458 --> 52:07.666
No

52:07.668 --> 52:08.793
Way

52:08.795 --> 52:10.293
Jose.

52:10.295 --> 52:14.509
But then, Boo Boo Squeal
also became hungry for power.

52:16.344 --> 52:17.635
Alas.

52:17.637 --> 52:21.597
The Sauce makes one hungry for
more Sauce.

52:21.599 --> 52:22.392
Indeed.

52:23.768 --> 52:27.230
Such is the nature of
the Sauce, my friend.

52:28.398 --> 52:30.273
Wait, what happened to
Boo Boo Squeal?

52:30.275 --> 52:31.818
What happened to me?

52:32.860 --> 52:37.030
Your father, the king,
disowned you, obviously.

52:37.032 --> 52:40.157
And Boo Boo defeated you,
of course.

52:40.159 --> 52:41.618
He was unstoppable.

52:43.996 --> 52:44.998
He still is.

52:45.831 --> 52:48.666
Unstoppable, and so cute.

52:48.668 --> 52:51.336
He beat you, Nuke, but
discord among the animals

52:51.338 --> 52:55.423
was created, and there was no
going back.

52:55.425 --> 52:58.092
Boo Boo Squeal assembled
his army.

52:58.094 --> 53:00.470
And defeated the Nice Side.

53:00.472 --> 53:03.847
And now, if we don't
stop him, he will rule

53:03.849 --> 53:05.434
the entire Zooverse.

53:12.483 --> 53:14.277
Um.

53:14.277 --> 53:15.318
Okay.

53:15.320 --> 53:16.110
Wait.

53:16.112 --> 53:17.737
What is it, Nuke, my friend?

53:17.739 --> 53:19.613
You're saying, the
cause of the war between

53:19.615 --> 53:21.532
the Nice Side and the Mice Side,

53:21.534 --> 53:23.742
a war that might result
in the obliteration of

53:23.744 --> 53:26.496
the entire Zooverse, is me?

53:26.498 --> 53:28.289
Yeah, pretty much.

53:28.291 --> 53:30.999
This is the truth you wanted
to tell me?

53:31.001 --> 53:34.378
The truth you made me
come all the way out here,

53:34.380 --> 53:37.548
to a whole different dimension
to hear?

53:37.550 --> 53:40.258
Alas, Nuke, my friend, it is.

53:40.260 --> 53:42.512
But, but Bongo Bananas?

53:42.514 --> 53:45.055
This is the worst truth I have
ever heard.

53:45.057 --> 53:47.936
Such are the ways of Sauce,
Nuke.

53:49.688 --> 53:50.853
I thought you were gonna tell
me that

53:50.855 --> 53:52.523
I was the Chosen One.

53:53.858 --> 53:54.816
Oh yeah.

53:54.818 --> 53:55.733
No.

53:55.735 --> 53:58.985
But then, then, why am I here?

53:58.987 --> 54:02.030
And who is the Chosen One?

54:02.032 --> 54:06.034
I believe I can answer both
of your questions, my friends,

54:06.036 --> 54:09.454
for the answer is one
and the same.

54:09.456 --> 54:10.248
Why?

54:10.250 --> 54:11.331
Who?

54:11.333 --> 54:14.043
The Chosen One is within you,
Nuke.

54:14.045 --> 54:15.378
Whoa, really?

54:15.380 --> 54:18.755
Yeah, he's actually
literally within you.

54:18.757 --> 54:21.342
Been there the whole time.

54:21.344 --> 54:24.095
Right on the underside
of your earlobe.

54:24.097 --> 54:24.887
What?

54:24.889 --> 54:25.679
Where?

54:25.681 --> 54:27.055
Here I am.

54:27.057 --> 54:28.182
Ew.

54:28.184 --> 54:29.976
Whoa, who are you?

54:29.978 --> 54:32.061
I'm Filippo
the Flea.

54:32.063 --> 54:35.481
Filippo the Flea,
the Chosen One.

54:35.483 --> 54:38.483
The only one who can
defeat Boo Boo Squeal.

54:38.485 --> 54:39.818
You have come.

54:39.820 --> 54:41.570
I have.

54:41.572 --> 54:42.988
Filippo the Flea...

54:42.990 --> 54:45.365
Is the Chosen One?

54:45.367 --> 54:46.950
Indeed, my friends.

54:46.952 --> 54:51.873
While I spent years teaching
Nuke the ways of the Sauce,

54:51.875 --> 54:56.336
Filippo here sat patiently
right inside Nuke's inner ear,

54:56.338 --> 54:59.841
listening, mastering
the ways of the Sauce.

55:00.925 --> 55:03.592
Unfortunately, he didn't
notice the thick layer

55:03.594 --> 55:07.806
of ear wax that eventually
trapped him inside Nuke's head.

55:08.891 --> 55:10.807
He could have stopped
all of this much sooner

55:10.809 --> 55:13.101
if only Nuke had been
more hygienic.

55:13.103 --> 55:14.269
Hey!

55:14.271 --> 55:17.317
Filippo has seen it all.

55:17.317 --> 55:19.566
And now that you have let him
free, Nuke,

55:19.568 --> 55:22.403
he's ready to take on
Boo Boo Squeal.

55:22.405 --> 55:23.862
Ready macaroni.

55:23.864 --> 55:26.532
Filippo.

55:26.534 --> 55:28.284
Always a hoot.

55:28.286 --> 55:30.619
This is the worst day
of my life.

55:30.621 --> 55:33.373
Eh, and the day is not
over peanuts.

55:33.375 --> 55:35.833
You'd best hold onto your hide.

55:35.835 --> 55:36.833
Ouch.

55:36.835 --> 55:37.876
Ew.

55:39.963 --> 55:42.255
And stop scratching.

55:47.554 --> 55:50.055
Full blasters ahead, crew.

55:50.057 --> 55:53.728
It's time to show Boo
Boo Squeal what's what.

55:55.063 --> 55:57.479
You think Filippo can
really defeat Boo Boo Squeal?

55:57.481 --> 55:59.398
Hey, I'm right here.

55:59.400 --> 56:00.441
I can hear you.

56:00.443 --> 56:02.403
Oh yeah.

56:02.403 --> 56:03.528
Sorry, Filippo.

56:03.530 --> 56:05.070
Yeah, yeah, it's
okay, Nuke,

56:05.072 --> 56:07.407
I'm just a flea, right?

56:10.119 --> 56:11.494
Greetings.

56:11.496 --> 56:14.791
It's Boo Boo Squeal.

56:14.791 --> 56:17.916
In the pelt, Squeezy.

56:17.918 --> 56:21.086
Hope you're ready to kiss
your puny pelt good bye.

56:21.088 --> 56:26.135
Boo Boo Squeal has come to
destroy you.

56:28.804 --> 56:30.972
The defense shields.

56:30.974 --> 56:32.639
They're jammed.

56:36.061 --> 56:40.565
All your weapons are
powerless against the Sauce.

56:42.360 --> 56:45.903
The subatomic blasters,
they're stalled.

56:47.699 --> 56:49.492
Ah, we're gonna die!

56:50.909 --> 56:53.327
Positive, carbon-based.

56:53.329 --> 56:56.664
We need to unleash the
Chosen One.

56:56.666 --> 56:58.874
That's our only hope.

56:58.876 --> 57:00.376
Filippo!

57:00.378 --> 57:02.003
Where is he?

57:02.005 --> 57:03.628
I don't know.

57:03.630 --> 57:08.383
But, all of a sudden I feel
fresh, and clean, and itch free.

57:08.385 --> 57:10.927
Maybe this day isn't
so bad after all.

57:10.929 --> 57:14.222
That's just a taste
of my powers.

57:14.224 --> 57:18.728
Now, I will show you what
I'm truly capable of.

57:18.730 --> 57:22.523
Prepare yourselves for full
Sauce power.

57:25.862 --> 57:27.110
Ouch!

57:27.112 --> 57:27.903
Hey!

57:27.905 --> 57:29.363
Ouch!

57:31.076 --> 57:32.532
Why am I so itchy?

57:32.534 --> 57:33.534
Filippo.

57:33.536 --> 57:35.327
Who's Filippo?

57:35.329 --> 57:36.579
Hey!

57:36.581 --> 57:37.454
Ouch!

57:37.456 --> 57:40.458
He's the Chosen One, Boo Boo.

57:40.460 --> 57:41.753
The one you seek.

57:42.836 --> 57:46.673
The Chosen One, at last.

57:46.675 --> 57:50.887
Show your face Chosen One so
I can finally destroy you.

57:53.764 --> 57:54.554
Ouch!

57:54.556 --> 57:55.516
Where are you?

57:56.643 --> 57:57.474
I'm here.

57:57.476 --> 57:58.559
Where?

57:58.561 --> 57:59.769
Show yourself.

57:59.771 --> 58:01.648
Ow!

58:01.648 --> 58:02.521
Ouch!

58:02.523 --> 58:04.023
Here!

58:04.025 --> 58:05.273
And here.

58:05.275 --> 58:11.782
And here, and here, and here.

58:11.782 --> 58:12.572
Ouch.

58:12.574 --> 58:13.615
Hey.

58:13.617 --> 58:14.117
Tickle,
tickle, tickle.

58:14.119 --> 58:15.742
Hey, no.

58:15.744 --> 58:16.911
Tickle,
tickle, tickle.

58:16.913 --> 58:17.704
Ouch!

58:17.706 --> 58:18.498
Whoa.

58:20.833 --> 58:23.751
The power of the Sauce
has turned against you,

58:23.753 --> 58:25.503
Boo Boo Squeal.

58:25.505 --> 58:26.713
What? Where?

58:26.715 --> 58:28.088
Who?

58:28.090 --> 58:28.630
Tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle, tickle.

58:28.632 --> 58:30.465
Hey, no.

58:30.467 --> 58:31.508
Wait.

58:31.510 --> 58:32.467
Tickle,
tickle, tickle.

58:34.304 --> 58:35.512
No more.

58:35.514 --> 58:36.347
Tickle,
tickle, tickle, tickle,

58:36.349 --> 58:37.472
tickle, tickle.

58:37.474 --> 58:38.516
I can't!

58:38.518 --> 58:39.891
Tickle,
tickle, tickle.

58:40.894 --> 58:42.854
- Do you give up?
- Never!

58:42.856 --> 58:44.021
Tickle,
tickle, tickle, tickle.

58:44.023 --> 58:46.648
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

58:46.650 --> 58:48.108
No, no.

58:48.110 --> 58:48.985
Okay.

58:48.987 --> 58:49.860
Tickle,
tickle, tickle.

58:52.032 --> 58:53.072
Wait.

58:53.074 --> 58:54.782
Tickle,
tickle, tickle.

58:54.784 --> 58:57.784
Tickle, tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle.

58:59.621 --> 59:02.789
Filippo is truly the
Chosen One.

59:02.791 --> 59:05.001
Pretty impressive.

59:06.378 --> 59:10.465
Surrender, Boo Boo
Squeal, or the Chosen One

59:10.467 --> 59:13.052
will show no mercy on your hide.

59:16.056 --> 59:17.095
Tickle,
tickle, tickle.

59:17.097 --> 59:20.601
- Tickle, tickle, tickle.
- No.

59:20.601 --> 59:21.934
Stop.

59:21.936 --> 59:22.809
I give up.

59:22.811 --> 59:23.605
I give up.

59:26.440 --> 59:30.152
Your reign of evil is
over, Boo Boo Squeal.

59:31.737 --> 59:33.028
Finally.

59:33.030 --> 59:35.741
Peaceful reign among
all animals.

59:36.784 --> 59:37.743
Big and small.

59:38.994 --> 59:42.162
Yay.

59:44.333 --> 59:45.666
No.

59:45.668 --> 59:47.084
Stop.

59:47.086 --> 59:48.043
I give up.

59:48.045 --> 59:48.837
I give up.

59:50.757 --> 59:51.880
Ouch.

59:51.882 --> 59:52.675
Ew!

59:58.514 --> 01:00:00.682
And so it came
to pass that the Mice Side

01:00:00.684 --> 01:00:03.642
and the Nice Side agreed
to a truce and to seal

01:00:03.644 --> 01:00:04.976
the Peace Accord.

01:00:04.978 --> 01:00:06.896
Princess Sparklefeather of the
Nice Side

01:00:06.898 --> 01:00:10.775
and Squeezy Whistle, rogue
warrior of the Mice Side, wed.

01:00:10.777 --> 01:00:14.403
Dearly beloved, we
are gathered here today

01:00:14.405 --> 01:00:17.699
on this happy
and joyous occasion.

01:00:17.701 --> 01:00:19.536
Oh my motherboard.

01:00:20.494 --> 01:00:22.994
I think I'm going to cry.

01:00:22.996 --> 01:00:25.539
Oh wait, I have no tear ducts.

01:00:25.541 --> 01:00:30.086
To join this lovely pachyderm
and this brave squirrel

01:00:30.088 --> 01:00:32.505
in loving matrimony.

01:00:32.507 --> 01:00:34.425
Oh, they are so cute.

01:00:35.217 --> 01:00:38.679
You may now kiss the bride.

01:00:53.777 --> 01:00:56.737
Make no mistake,
foolish space animals.

01:00:56.739 --> 01:00:59.449
The Zoo Wars are not over.

01:00:59.451 --> 01:01:01.952
Boo Boo Squeal will rise again.

01:01:06.248 --> 01:01:07.164
Tickle,
tickle, tickle.

01:01:07.166 --> 01:01:08.541
Oh, ouch.

01:01:08.543 --> 01:01:10.251
Tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle, tickle.

01:01:10.253 --> 01:01:11.836
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

01:01:11.838 --> 01:01:12.878
No.

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:13.588
Tickle,
tickle, tickle.

01:01:13.590 --> 01:01:14.796
Stop that.

01:01:14.798 --> 01:01:15.255
Tickle,
tickle, tickle, tickle.

01:01:15.257 --> 01:01:16.050
Oh geez.
