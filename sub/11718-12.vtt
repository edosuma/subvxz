WEBVTT

00:07.803 --> 00:09.404
Oh, where is it?

00:09.471 --> 00:11.272
Are you sure
we're in the right place?

00:11.323 --> 00:13.741
Yeah, it's right
up here.

00:13.809 --> 00:16.778
Cool-- an old bunker.

00:16.829 --> 00:18.413
This is what
you wanted to show us?

00:18.480 --> 00:19.580
It's inside.

00:19.648 --> 00:21.982
What's inside--
unexploded bombs?

00:22.034 --> 00:23.284
Zombie marines?

00:23.335 --> 00:25.503
No, but there's a lava tube
at the back

00:25.587 --> 00:27.505
that leads
to a whole network of caves.

00:27.573 --> 00:29.073
Yeah, and after the war,

00:29.141 --> 00:30.917
army engineers tried
to keep it a secret.

00:30.942 --> 00:31.926
That's right.

00:31.927 --> 00:34.212
Let's hurry
before somebody comes.

00:34.279 --> 00:35.346
Somebody comes
around here?

00:35.431 --> 00:36.848
Hey, didn't some girl fall

00:36.932 --> 00:38.383
in one of these and die?

00:38.467 --> 00:40.802
A) she was drunk and B)
she wasn't an experienced caver.

00:40.869 --> 00:43.054
And you are?

00:43.122 --> 00:44.522
You guys coming or not?

00:44.606 --> 00:47.058
Okay.
Let's go.

00:47.126 --> 00:48.643
Ready?

00:48.694 --> 00:50.695
Yeah, let's do this.

00:54.650 --> 00:56.451
Oh. It's hot in here.

00:56.518 --> 00:58.185
It's creepy, though.

00:58.237 --> 01:00.872
I know. You know,
somebody could be in here.

01:00.956 --> 01:02.990
What was that?

01:03.041 --> 01:04.709
Brains!
Huh?

01:04.793 --> 01:06.377
Knock it off,
Tulley.

01:06.462 --> 01:08.446
Told you. Just an old bunker

01:08.514 --> 01:09.864
full of junk.

01:13.335 --> 01:14.368
Let's do this.

01:16.171 --> 01:18.589
Wow. That thing looks deep.

01:18.674 --> 01:19.640
So, who wants to go first?

01:19.708 --> 01:21.309
Ooh! Not me.

01:21.376 --> 01:22.727
Uh-uh. No.

01:22.811 --> 01:25.045
- Guess I'll do it.
- Okay.

01:28.967 --> 01:30.735
- Take this end.
- Okay.

01:30.819 --> 01:31.819
Drop this.

01:34.323 --> 01:36.190
- Be careful.
- Let me in nice and easy, all right?

01:36.241 --> 01:37.442
Yup, you got it.

01:52.207 --> 01:53.875
Hold tight, guys.
I'm almost there.

02:02.184 --> 02:04.302
Jimmy? You okay?

02:04.369 --> 02:06.921
Yeah, I'm okay.

02:08.357 --> 02:09.473
I'm gonna look
around a bit.

02:53.468 --> 02:55.436
I'm telling you, son.

02:55.487 --> 02:58.990
I have run the name Shelburne
through all of my contacts--

02:59.074 --> 03:03.160
NSA, Interpol, FBI,
CIA, DOD,

03:03.228 --> 03:05.229
every other acronym

03:05.297 --> 03:07.064
and I've come up
with exactly zero.

03:07.132 --> 03:09.500
Shelburne is a ghost.

03:09.568 --> 03:13.120
Yeah, well, this ghost has
got Wo Fat spooked, okay?

03:13.171 --> 03:15.456
If we want to catch
that son of a bitch,

03:15.507 --> 03:17.341
finding Shelburne
is the way to do it.

03:20.462 --> 03:22.380
I didn't know
Danny was living

03:22.464 --> 03:23.664
at the Hilton.

03:23.715 --> 03:25.833
Oh, he's kind of
between places right now.

03:25.884 --> 03:27.685
You got space.

03:27.769 --> 03:30.354
Yeah, we, uh...
we tried that.

03:30.439 --> 03:32.006
Didn't work out so well.

03:33.025 --> 03:34.559
No, thank you.

03:34.643 --> 03:37.895
Come on, we're gonna be late
for the tux fitting. Let's go!

03:37.980 --> 03:40.064
Chin's wedding,
this Saturday, remember?

03:40.148 --> 03:43.784
Hey, we're busy.
Come back later, please. Thanks.

03:43.852 --> 03:45.519
So, you're busy?

03:45.571 --> 03:47.204
I can't come back later, Daniel.

03:47.289 --> 03:48.656
I'm the best man.

03:48.707 --> 03:51.242
I got to make sure the groomsmen
are in their monkey suits.

03:51.326 --> 03:53.578
Let's go! Open the door.
Come on.

03:53.662 --> 03:56.030
Hey.
Hey.

04:04.139 --> 04:07.308
Not what it looks like.

04:08.477 --> 04:09.560
Okay.

04:10.679 --> 04:11.812
You want, we can
come back later.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.130
No. It's fine.

04:13.198 --> 04:15.683
Listen, Lori just came
over to use the pool.

04:15.734 --> 04:17.601
- That's all, okay?
- Yeah, the, uh...

04:17.685 --> 04:19.185
The spa services, actually.

04:19.237 --> 04:22.156
Turns out, the room comes with
complimentary spa service.

04:22.223 --> 04:24.358
Mm-hmm, you know, like,
a hot stone massage.

04:24.409 --> 04:26.911
Yeah, I'm not a spa service
kind of guy myself.

04:26.995 --> 04:28.245
You know, I'm not, either,
all right? But I didn't

04:28.330 --> 04:29.614
want to let it
go to waste,

04:29.681 --> 04:31.115
so I called Lori so
she could use it.

04:31.183 --> 04:34.702
And the, uh... the handcuffs?

04:34.753 --> 04:38.623
Oh, uh, Danny was showing me
the, uh... the Jersey Slip.

04:38.707 --> 04:40.124
Jersey Slip.

04:40.208 --> 04:41.292
The hood rat cuff slip.

04:41.376 --> 04:42.960
Yeah, all the kids
were doing it

04:43.028 --> 04:44.629
back East, so,
thought I'd show her.

04:44.713 --> 04:47.598
- Yeah, and, um, we...
-  lost the key

04:47.683 --> 04:49.016
somewhere, I think
in the couch.

04:49.084 --> 04:50.384
- The couch?
- Yeah.

04:50.435 --> 04:52.637
So I don't know. Maybe you want
to set up a search grid,

04:52.721 --> 04:53.804
call a K-9 unit.

04:53.889 --> 04:55.272
Yeah.

04:55.357 --> 04:56.641
All right, keep searching.

04:56.708 --> 04:58.025
It's got to be around here
somewhere.

04:58.760 --> 04:59.777
It's not here.

04:59.861 --> 05:01.178
Danny, did you check
your pockets?

05:01.246 --> 05:02.647
Of course I checked my pockets.

05:02.731 --> 05:03.831
I'm not a complete idiot.

05:03.899 --> 05:05.449
Okay. Okay, see?
Nothing in here.

05:05.517 --> 05:06.651
Okay, all right, well,

05:06.735 --> 05:08.569
why don't we check both?

05:08.620 --> 05:12.156
Wait. What's this?

05:12.240 --> 05:14.075
Really?
Oh, look at that.

05:14.126 --> 05:15.042
Really?

05:15.110 --> 05:16.327
In your pocket.

05:16.411 --> 05:18.329
You would think that we
were making this story up.

05:18.413 --> 05:19.563
- The whole time?
- - Yeah...

05:19.631 --> 05:21.215
In the pocket?

05:22.584 --> 05:24.885
What? Huh?

05:24.953 --> 05:26.037
Thank you.

05:26.104 --> 05:27.672
Let me see that.

05:27.756 --> 05:29.840
Hey, hey, hey,
that hurts!

05:29.925 --> 05:32.176
What are you doing? Huh?

05:32.260 --> 05:33.844
I thought you were gonna show us

05:33.929 --> 05:36.180
the, uh, the Jersey Slip
from back East. Go ahead.

05:36.264 --> 05:38.149
Do me a favor,
please, would you?

05:38.233 --> 05:40.735
I can shoot 'em off you,
like they do in Afghanistan.

05:40.802 --> 05:41.986
Oh, that's funny, Joe.
I like that.

05:42.070 --> 05:43.154
Can I have the key, please?

05:43.238 --> 05:45.656
Look at that view.

05:45.741 --> 05:47.742
Oh, it's nice, right?
They give us

05:47.809 --> 05:49.026
a nice view here. They, um...

05:49.111 --> 05:50.695
They got an even better view
in the master bedroom.

05:50.779 --> 05:51.862
- Master bedroom?
- Mm-hmm.

05:51.947 --> 05:53.698
- How many rooms you got?
- Two. two.

05:53.782 --> 05:56.033
Two. And the master bathroom's
ridiculous.

05:56.118 --> 05:57.952
- Can I have the key, please?
- I mean, you told me you were staying

05:58.003 --> 05:59.587
at the Hilton, but this is...
- This is the Ali'i Suite.

06:00.822 --> 06:01.872
How 'd you swing this?

06:01.957 --> 06:04.091
Well, like a genius,
I put my card

06:04.159 --> 06:05.509
in the Christmas raffle
downstairs

06:05.594 --> 06:07.094
at the Tropics Bar,
and I got lucky.

06:07.162 --> 06:09.380
Got any more questions,
or can I have the key, please?

06:09.464 --> 06:12.266
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:12.333 --> 06:13.434
Oops.

06:13.501 --> 06:15.936
Why would you do that?

06:16.004 --> 06:17.722
So, what you guys think--

06:17.806 --> 06:20.858
buttercup, cabernet,

06:20.942 --> 06:23.978
paisley lavender sunset
for the vest?

06:24.029 --> 06:26.614
No, no, no.
Malia was very specific.

06:26.681 --> 06:28.532
There are no vests,
no bow ties,

06:28.617 --> 06:30.868
and no paisley
lavender anything.

06:30.952 --> 06:33.404
What does she think about
the cummerbunds? 'Cause you know

06:33.488 --> 06:35.623
I got to have a
little flair.

06:35.690 --> 06:36.707
Cummerbunds are restrictive.

06:36.792 --> 06:37.792
Restrictive?

06:37.859 --> 06:39.410
And unmanly.

06:39.494 --> 06:41.045
You know, according
to, uh, <i>GQ,</i>

06:41.129 --> 06:42.129
suspenders
are trending.

06:42.197 --> 06:44.215
Got a problem
with suspenders?

06:44.299 --> 06:46.383
Functional, dignified.

06:46.468 --> 06:48.219
- Suspenders, huh?
- Yeah, hold on. Hold on a second.

06:48.303 --> 06:49.420
Isn't this
a beach wedding, Chin?

06:49.504 --> 06:50.588
Mm-hmm, yeah.

06:50.672 --> 06:52.840
What's wrong with boardies
and-and slippers?

06:52.891 --> 06:54.091
What's wrong with them is that

06:54.176 --> 06:55.593
they do not match
the bridesmaids' dresses.

06:55.677 --> 06:56.560
Oh.

06:56.645 --> 06:58.562
And for the record, Danny,

06:58.647 --> 07:00.514
uh, neither do handcuffs.

07:00.565 --> 07:02.733
I was gonna ask about those.

07:02.818 --> 07:05.569
Show 'em
the Jersey Slip, Danno.

07:05.654 --> 07:07.438
I offered to shoot 'em off.

07:07.522 --> 07:09.356
No key, no problem, brah.

07:09.407 --> 07:11.075
Bring, bring, bring.

07:11.159 --> 07:13.494
Hmm.

07:13.561 --> 07:15.479
Wow.

07:17.398 --> 07:18.699
It's an old island trick.

07:18.750 --> 07:19.667
Impressive.

07:21.369 --> 07:24.421
McGarrett.

07:24.506 --> 07:26.373
Yeah. Be there in 20.

07:26.424 --> 07:29.794
Guys, zip it up.
We got a body.

07:31.346 --> 07:33.180
<i>What's the situation, Kono?</i>

07:33.248 --> 07:34.965
Couple of kids
broke into one

07:35.050 --> 07:36.684
of the bunkers to
explore a lava tube

07:36.751 --> 07:38.302
and they found a body.

07:38.370 --> 07:40.521
What happened to skateboarding
and stickball?

07:40.588 --> 07:42.056
Yeah, I know.
Officer Kalakaua?

07:42.107 --> 07:43.691
Go ahead.
Max is inside.

07:45.727 --> 07:47.695
This whole valley

07:47.762 --> 07:50.030
has hundreds of these
unexplored lava tubes.

07:50.098 --> 07:52.483
I'm thinking there's a reason
they're unexplored.

07:52.567 --> 07:53.334
Actually,

07:53.401 --> 07:55.619
this system has been explored,

07:55.704 --> 07:57.371
just not mapped
by the Underground

07:57.438 --> 07:59.990
Paradise Spelunking Club,
of which I am

08:00.075 --> 08:01.625
a founding member and treasurer.

08:01.693 --> 08:03.994
Oh, well, thank you,
Captain Caveman.

08:04.079 --> 08:05.462
That looks deep.

08:05.547 --> 08:07.715
I estimate the floor to be
at a depth of 30 meters.

08:07.782 --> 08:08.999
30 meters?
Well, this definitely

08:09.084 --> 08:11.919
looks like a job
for a Navy SEAL.

08:11.970 --> 08:14.722
Well, I took the liberty
of anchoring our rappel line.

08:14.789 --> 08:16.340
You want to come down there
with me?

08:16.424 --> 08:17.508
- Oh, absolutely.
- All right.

08:17.592 --> 08:18.843
Let's spelunk.

08:33.491 --> 08:35.693
- All right, Max.
- All right.

08:45.003 --> 08:46.587
- Good?
- Yeah.

08:49.324 --> 08:51.175
Apparent gunshot wound

08:51.259 --> 08:54.211
to the posterior chest cavity.

08:54.296 --> 08:57.264
Heavy contusion, most likely
as a result of the fall.

08:59.351 --> 09:01.969
Looks like
I found the murder weapon.

09:03.104 --> 09:05.105
It's a .38 cal.

09:06.207 --> 09:08.192
Recently fired.

09:09.861 --> 09:11.729
Serial number's been filed off.

09:14.532 --> 09:16.150
Badass.

09:17.786 --> 09:21.705
Okay, the deceased's name
is Rafe Tong.

09:21.790 --> 09:23.407
Hmm.

09:23.491 --> 09:25.409
This doesn't look
like Rafe Tong.

09:25.493 --> 09:26.827
What are you
talking about?

09:26.878 --> 09:28.879
Let me see that.

09:30.916 --> 09:32.917
Help me get
him over.

09:33.919 --> 09:35.336
One, two, three.

09:40.375 --> 09:42.709
Rafe Tong.

09:44.212 --> 09:45.512
What the hell.

09:45.563 --> 09:48.649
Oh!

09:57.823 --> 09:59.791
Hey, guys, we got
any word on our vic?

09:59.858 --> 10:01.126
Yeah, Kono's at
the hospital now.

10:01.193 --> 10:02.494
He's in
a medically-induced coma,

10:02.545 --> 10:05.130
and doctors won't know more
until he stabilizes.

10:05.197 --> 10:06.965
- How long was he down there?
- At least 12 hours.

10:07.032 --> 10:08.833
You get ballistics
back yet?

10:08.884 --> 10:10.919
Yeah, gun found at the
scene matches the slug

10:11.003 --> 10:12.220
removed from our victim.

10:12.304 --> 10:14.005
All right, we
get an ID?

10:14.056 --> 10:17.175
Well, we got zip on the facial
recognition, and no missing

10:17.226 --> 10:19.227
persons reports that match.
- Which leaves us

10:19.311 --> 10:21.479
with Rafe Tong, whose ID
we did find on our victim.

10:21.547 --> 10:24.149
Yeah, this is one busy guy--
assault and battery,

10:24.216 --> 10:26.151
couple of B and Es,
animal cruelty,

10:26.218 --> 10:28.570
misdemeanor possession,

10:28.637 --> 10:29.938
and half a dozen
weapons charges.

10:30.022 --> 10:31.156
His P.O. says he stays

10:31.223 --> 10:32.524
at his girlfriend's house
in Ewa Beach.

10:32.575 --> 10:34.609
Yeah, I would love to hear
how this guy's wallet

10:34.693 --> 10:36.244
ends up on our victim.

10:36.312 --> 10:37.245
Yeah. Me, too.

10:37.329 --> 10:39.364
Yeah.

10:43.735 --> 10:46.454
- Steve McGarrett?
- Present.

10:47.506 --> 10:49.340
My name is Adam Noshimuri.

10:49.408 --> 10:51.676
You may remember my father,
Hiro Noshimuri.

10:51.743 --> 10:54.045
He was kidnapped
at gunpoint

10:54.096 --> 10:56.747
by Joe White, a friend of your
late father's, I believe.

10:56.799 --> 10:58.633
What do you want
from me?

10:58.717 --> 11:02.437
I want you to arrange a
sit-down with Mr. White.

11:02.521 --> 11:03.855
I want to know
where my father is.

11:03.922 --> 11:06.257
I'll ask.

11:08.527 --> 11:11.312
I'm just a son looking
for his father.

11:11.397 --> 11:13.031
You of all people
should understand that.

11:13.098 --> 11:15.533
But I can't promise
I'll be patient,

11:15.601 --> 11:18.603
and should we find
Joe White before you do,

11:18.654 --> 11:20.955
we may not be
so polite.

11:36.788 --> 11:38.723
What did Joe do with Hiro?

11:38.790 --> 11:41.092
He told me he interrogated him
and let him go.

11:41.143 --> 11:43.228
Do you believe him?

11:44.263 --> 11:46.764
I don't know.

11:46.816 --> 11:49.017
Go, all right?

11:49.084 --> 11:50.801
Danny and I will
talk to Rafe Tong.

11:55.307 --> 11:56.241
Hey!

11:56.308 --> 11:57.492
Five-O!

11:57.576 --> 11:58.576
Open up.

12:01.997 --> 12:04.966
Rafe Tong, we need to talk.

12:08.320 --> 12:09.404
Hey, yo.

12:10.822 --> 12:12.974
Hey, your boy's running.

12:22.134 --> 12:24.052
<i>All I want to know</i>

12:24.136 --> 12:28.523
is why I found your wallet
in this guy's pocket.

12:28.607 --> 12:32.443
He was shot in a bunker
at Pearl City.

12:32.511 --> 12:34.011
- Look, I don't know anything about that.
- You don't?

12:34.063 --> 12:35.647
See, that's a problem
'cause, like I said,

12:35.698 --> 12:38.533
I found your wallet on
this guy-- my victim.

12:40.486 --> 12:43.020
This is your
wallet, right?

12:43.072 --> 12:44.021
It says "Badass."

12:44.073 --> 12:45.123
You look like a
badass, right?

12:45.190 --> 12:46.875
Whoa, jackpot.

12:48.860 --> 12:51.028
We got one submachine gun--
and you're going to like this.

12:52.665 --> 12:54.415
Grenades.

12:54.500 --> 12:57.969
World War II era grenades, the
kind you might find in a bunker.

12:58.036 --> 13:00.638
You see, this is
bad for you because

13:00.706 --> 13:03.508
rifles alone will
violate your parole,

13:03.559 --> 13:04.759
and before you
start whining

13:04.843 --> 13:06.261
about your Second
Amendment right,

13:06.345 --> 13:07.845
your right
to bear arms,

13:07.897 --> 13:09.931
please let me remind you
that that right applies

13:10.015 --> 13:11.099
to law-abiding citizens--

13:11.183 --> 13:14.185
those who are not
currently on parole.

13:14.236 --> 13:16.321
They're dummy grenades.

13:16.388 --> 13:16.437
I was just storing them
for a friend.

13:18.056 --> 13:21.159
Dummy grenades
for-for a friend?

13:21.226 --> 13:22.160
That's-that's awful.

13:22.227 --> 13:23.945
Okay, I'll play along.

13:24.029 --> 13:25.196
Grab ahold of
that, would you?

13:25.247 --> 13:26.497
Hold on really tight.

13:26.565 --> 13:28.032
Now, if this is a dummy
grenade, you're gonna

13:28.083 --> 13:29.534
be fine, but if
it's not, it's gonna

13:29.585 --> 13:30.668
explode right
in your hand,

13:30.736 --> 13:32.620
so keep ahold tight, okay?

13:32.705 --> 13:35.340
You let me know,
we'll be outside. Come on.

13:35.407 --> 13:37.575
Okay, okay.

13:37.626 --> 13:40.128
You've been hanging
with McGarrett too long.

13:40.212 --> 13:41.379
What are you
talking about?

13:42.514 --> 13:44.081
All right, let's
hear it, badass, huh?

13:44.133 --> 13:45.850
Look, dude, it's live.

13:45.917 --> 13:46.684
I know it's live.

13:46.752 --> 13:48.136
I look like an idiot?
Come on.

13:48.220 --> 13:49.920
You seen this
guy or not?

13:49.972 --> 13:51.606
All right, he was
at the Magic Reef Bar

13:51.690 --> 13:52.757
asking around
about some woman.

13:52.808 --> 13:54.692
Saw him give
the bartender a hundy

13:54.760 --> 13:56.477
just for information.

13:56.562 --> 13:57.729
Said she was a blonde.

13:57.780 --> 13:59.314
He a regular there?

13:59.398 --> 14:00.315
Never saw him before.

14:00.399 --> 14:01.899
Guy looked
like a stupid tourist.

14:01.951 --> 14:03.451
Okay.

14:03.535 --> 14:04.986
Did he find the girl
he was looking for?

14:05.070 --> 14:06.270
Not that I saw.

14:07.573 --> 14:08.957
Okay, so what'd you do,

14:09.041 --> 14:11.075
just gave him your wallet out
of the kindness of your heart?

14:14.112 --> 14:16.947
Actually, I followed him
out to his car and, um...

14:18.000 --> 14:20.885
...maybe I mugged him.

14:20.952 --> 14:22.587
Maybe you mugged him.

14:22.638 --> 14:23.921
That is not
very Aloha of you,

14:23.973 --> 14:26.290
but it still does not
explain why he had

14:26.342 --> 14:27.425
your wallet.

14:27.476 --> 14:28.793
The gun he pointed
in my face does.

14:28.844 --> 14:30.144
Wait a second.

14:30.229 --> 14:31.962
- I thought you mugged him.
- Yeah, that's right,

14:32.014 --> 14:34.565
but then he came back acting
all Charlie Bronson.

14:34.633 --> 14:36.100
You know, flashes his gun,
says there's something

14:36.151 --> 14:37.402
real important in his wallet
and that he's tired

14:37.469 --> 14:39.637
of being pushed around
and taken advantage of.

14:39.688 --> 14:40.688
Did you give it back?

14:40.773 --> 14:41.406
Nope.

14:41.473 --> 14:42.774
No?

14:43.826 --> 14:44.776
He took
my wallet,

14:44.827 --> 14:48.112
and before
I could give back his,

14:48.163 --> 14:49.697
the security guard pulled in
and I ran.

14:49.782 --> 14:51.115
What did you do

14:51.166 --> 14:52.500
with his wallet?

14:53.819 --> 14:55.953
I love the smell of garbage
in the morning.

14:56.005 --> 14:58.289
Huh?

14:58.340 --> 15:00.157
How you doing
in there, badass?

15:00.209 --> 15:01.876
Got it.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.928
Nice.

15:03.995 --> 15:05.996
Stay in there.

15:08.017 --> 15:10.167
All right, uh, our guy's name
is Dennis Archer,

15:10.219 --> 15:12.136
he's from Tucson, Arizona.

15:14.390 --> 15:19.143
Pawn slip dated the day
before the shooting.

15:19.194 --> 15:21.195
All right,
thanks, buddy.

15:33.242 --> 15:34.959
Who were you expecting, Joe?

15:35.026 --> 15:38.162
Can't be too careful.

15:50.893 --> 15:53.594
You know Adam Noshimuri
is looking for his father.

15:53.679 --> 15:55.430
Hiro was alive when I left him.

15:55.514 --> 15:57.515
You sure about that?

15:57.566 --> 15:58.516
Who knows?

15:58.567 --> 15:59.600
Maybe Wo Fat found him.

15:59.685 --> 16:02.103
This is serious, Joe.

16:03.388 --> 16:05.222
Hiro is the head of
the Yakuza, okay,

16:05.274 --> 16:06.557
and the last time
anybody saw him,

16:06.608 --> 16:07.992
you had your gun
pointed in his face.

16:08.059 --> 16:11.195
I had one chance before Wo Fat
got to him and I took it.

16:11.246 --> 16:13.781
Yeah, well, for your sake,
I hope he's okay, Joe, okay,

16:13.866 --> 16:16.167
because Adam Noshimuri
is not going to stop

16:16.234 --> 16:18.953
until he finds his
father, you get that?

16:19.037 --> 16:20.872
I'll keep that in mind.

16:25.210 --> 16:27.411
Something else?

16:27.463 --> 16:30.381
Something else?
Yeah, what's going on?

16:30.432 --> 16:32.884
You're going to have
to be more specific, son.

16:32.935 --> 16:34.886
Do you know who
Shelburne is, Joe?

16:34.937 --> 16:37.688
Ask me another question.

16:37.756 --> 16:40.057
Do you or do you not
know who Shelburne is?

16:40.109 --> 16:42.810
I'm not going to answer that.

16:42.895 --> 16:45.262
When your father

16:45.314 --> 16:47.064
sent you away, I promised
to look after you,

16:47.116 --> 16:48.366
and that's a promise

16:48.433 --> 16:49.784
I intend to keep.

16:49.868 --> 16:50.985
Oh, yeah,
by lying to me?

16:51.069 --> 16:53.237
No, by containing
this Shelburne thing

16:53.288 --> 16:54.622
before you get caught up in it.

16:56.658 --> 16:59.410
Just be careful.

16:59.461 --> 17:02.046
Always am.

17:19.130 --> 17:22.517
What are you doing
in Japan, Joe?

17:25.521 --> 17:27.571
<i>Hai.</i>

17:27.638 --> 17:30.641
<i>Arigatou gozaimasu.</i>

17:31.643 --> 17:33.394
Have you talked to Joe?

17:33.462 --> 17:34.579
Yeah, he doesn't know
where Hiro is.

17:34.646 --> 17:36.313
You don't believe him?

17:36.365 --> 17:38.449
No, I don't believe him.

17:39.451 --> 17:41.285
All right, okay.

17:41.336 --> 17:42.537
We get an ID
on the vic?

17:42.621 --> 17:44.589
Yeah, his name is Dennis Archer.

17:44.656 --> 17:46.340
.38 we found at the scene
does belong to him.

17:46.425 --> 17:47.825
He bought it two days ago,
illegally,

17:47.876 --> 17:48.843
at a pawnshop.

17:48.927 --> 17:50.327
Of course the gun
was wiped clean.

17:50.379 --> 17:52.263
What was this guy doing
with a gun, anyway?

17:52.330 --> 17:53.714
I don't know, we got a
witness-- says he saw him

17:53.799 --> 17:55.332
at a dive bar asking
about a woman,

17:55.384 --> 17:56.851
some blonde.

17:56.935 --> 17:59.336
Hey, I just spoke to the
victim's wife, Sharon Archer.

17:59.388 --> 18:01.105
She had no idea that her
husband was in Hawaii.

18:01.172 --> 18:04.008
Okay, did she say
whether he was having an affair?

18:04.059 --> 18:05.142
She said their marriage
was good.

18:05.194 --> 18:06.110
Wasn't that good
if she didn't know

18:06.177 --> 18:07.111
he was in Hawaii.

18:07.178 --> 18:08.479
Yeah, he lied.

18:08.530 --> 18:10.147
He said he was at a teacher's
conference in Flagstaff.

18:10.199 --> 18:11.148
Okay, this guy--

18:11.200 --> 18:12.516
listen,
he, uh, has

18:12.568 --> 18:15.019
no record, completely clean,
not even a traffic ticket.

18:15.070 --> 18:16.454
Yeah, but I ran
his financials

18:16.521 --> 18:17.855
and it turns out

18:17.906 --> 18:20.992
he drained his entire savings
account-- nearly $50,000.

18:21.043 --> 18:21.959
Well, that's good.

18:22.027 --> 18:23.027
When?
Three days

18:23.078 --> 18:24.045
after he arrived.

18:24.129 --> 18:26.581
He also rented a
car and took a room

18:26.665 --> 18:27.882
at the Sand Dollar Hotel.

18:33.538 --> 18:35.539
Thank you.

18:45.100 --> 18:47.051
Hey, hey.

18:47.102 --> 18:48.269
What do you got?

18:48.353 --> 18:49.770
Looks like our
mystery woman.

18:49.855 --> 18:51.272
Rafe Tong
said our vic

18:51.356 --> 18:53.357
was looking for a
blonde woman, right?

18:53.408 --> 18:55.192
- Who's the guy?
- I don't know.

18:55.244 --> 18:57.227
Could be our killer.

18:57.279 --> 19:00.665
Okay, so, this
guy, uh, lies

19:00.732 --> 19:03.951
to his we, right, gets on
a plane, comes to Hawaii,

19:04.036 --> 19:05.503
meets a girl,
and he falls in love.

19:05.570 --> 19:07.255
What do you think?

19:07.339 --> 19:08.422
I think you're right.

19:08.507 --> 19:10.458
Then he drains his bank account,

19:10.542 --> 19:11.959
promises her
"we're going to disappear,"

19:12.044 --> 19:13.678
then he finds out
the whole thing's a scam,

19:13.745 --> 19:14.745
loses his mind.

19:14.796 --> 19:16.714
Then he winds up shot and left
for dead

19:16.765 --> 19:17.715
in an abandoned bunker.

19:17.766 --> 19:19.350
I got a receipt
for a luggage shop.

19:19.417 --> 19:21.636
Looks like this guy bought
a Halliburton case.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.220
I don't see one here.

19:23.272 --> 19:25.422
Well, maybe he used it
to store the 50 grand.

19:26.475 --> 19:28.559
HPD! Show us your hands!

19:28.610 --> 19:29.694
McGarrett.

19:29.761 --> 19:31.145
Captain Fryer, what
are you doing here?

19:31.229 --> 19:32.229
You tell me, man.

19:32.281 --> 19:33.197
Huh, we're working a case.

19:33.264 --> 19:34.231
I'm working a case, too.

19:34.283 --> 19:35.399
You're working a case?

19:35.450 --> 19:36.534
Yeah.

19:36.601 --> 19:38.286
See, this whole time,
I think that the promotion

19:38.370 --> 19:41.038
to Chief of Detectives
is a desk jockey job.

19:41.106 --> 19:43.107
No, Chief of Ds should be out in
the field catching cases, okay?

19:43.158 --> 19:44.492
I'm old-school like that.

19:44.576 --> 19:46.827
Okay, good, well, this is
our catch and it's our case.

19:46.912 --> 19:48.579
- You got it?
- This is my Jane Doe.

19:48.630 --> 19:50.447
- What are you talking about, huh?
- This is mine.

19:50.499 --> 19:52.049
I found her body
in the trunk of a car

19:52.117 --> 19:54.335
rented by some guy
named Dennis Archer.

19:54.419 --> 19:57.004
I traced the card he used
to rent the car to this room.

19:57.089 --> 19:58.589
And here we are.

19:58.640 --> 20:00.391
Yeah, I know, here you are
doing what exactly?

20:00.458 --> 20:01.792
We're working
the Dennis Archer case.

20:01.843 --> 20:03.311
The Dennis Archer case?

20:03.395 --> 20:05.429
Okay, we found his body--
he was shot and left for dead

20:05.480 --> 20:07.181
in a bunker outside
of Pearl City.

20:07.265 --> 20:09.433
He's at the hospital
in a coma right now.

20:09.484 --> 20:11.068
- He's in a coma?
- Yes, coma.

20:11.136 --> 20:12.353
He's in a coma.

20:12.437 --> 20:14.238
Last I checked,
homicide takes precedence

20:14.305 --> 20:15.305
over attempted homicide.

20:15.357 --> 20:17.191
What are you
talking about?

20:17.275 --> 20:19.694
Okay, hold on, all right, look,
you got a case, we got a case.

20:19.778 --> 20:20.811
He's right.

20:20.862 --> 20:22.312
Let's let bygones
be bygones,

20:22.364 --> 20:25.282
pool our resources,
and work this case together.

20:26.317 --> 20:28.252
Okay, fine.

20:28.319 --> 20:29.870
All right, good,
all right, this is nice.

20:29.938 --> 20:31.539
Maybe you guys want
to hug it out a little bit,

20:31.623 --> 20:33.624
fist-bump, something like that.

20:33.675 --> 20:35.760
Um, no.

20:35.827 --> 20:36.761
Let's just work
the case, okay?

20:36.828 --> 20:37.795
All right, come on.

20:37.846 --> 20:38.796
All right,
so what was the caliber

20:38.847 --> 20:39.797
of the gun
she was killed with?

20:39.848 --> 20:41.665
- .38.
- That's same gun

20:41.717 --> 20:42.767
used in both shootings.

20:42.834 --> 20:44.168
Look, all I got

20:44.219 --> 20:47.171
is my Jane Doe in a car rented
by your victim, that's it.

20:47.222 --> 20:49.273
- You find anything in the car?
- Uh, initial search turned up zip.

20:49.340 --> 20:52.037
You got any indication
how your vic met my Jane Doe?

20:52.038 --> 20:54.055
No, but we got a couple witnesses,
say they saw him looking

20:54.062 --> 20:56.113
all over the place for a woman
who fits her description.

20:56.181 --> 20:58.009
Yeah, he found her
all right, didn't he?

20:58.425 --> 20:59.892
Hey, he's a mild-mannered
schoolteacher, not some killer.

21:00.018 --> 21:02.119
Okay, first thing
we need to do

21:02.187 --> 21:04.021
is ID your Jane Doe
and find out

21:04.072 --> 21:06.023
what her connection
was to Dennis Archer.

21:06.074 --> 21:07.241
I know where to start.

21:07.325 --> 21:09.243
She worked at the
Paradise Cove Luau.

21:09.327 --> 21:11.028
Really?

21:11.079 --> 21:12.163
How do you know that?

21:12.214 --> 21:13.664
How do I know?
Chief of Detectives,

21:13.715 --> 21:15.916
look at the photo
of your Jane Doe.

21:16.001 --> 21:17.585
She's wearing their uniform,
you see?

21:17.669 --> 21:18.919
I know that 'cause
I went there

21:19.004 --> 21:20.755
a couple of weeks ago for
umbrella drinks with Joe.

21:20.839 --> 21:22.056
He likes
umbrella drinks.

21:22.140 --> 21:24.141
Good times.

21:24.209 --> 21:27.261
Put your grass skirt on,
partner, we got work to do.

21:38.850 --> 21:40.185
Hey, good afternoon.

21:40.186 --> 21:41.103
Hey.

21:41.553 --> 21:42.658
How you doing?

21:42.659 --> 21:44.577
Good.

21:44.661 --> 21:45.578
You the manager here?

21:45.646 --> 21:46.579
I am.

21:46.663 --> 21:48.030
We're not open yet.

21:48.081 --> 21:51.167
Captain Fryer with HPD.
Steve McGarrett, Five-O.

21:51.234 --> 21:52.702
How can I help you?

21:52.753 --> 21:54.069
Just gonna ask you
a couple of questions, okay?

21:54.121 --> 21:57.290
The girl in the photo right
here, you seen her before?

21:57.374 --> 21:58.341
Yeah, that's Bridgett Turner.

21:58.408 --> 22:00.009
Bridgett Turner.
She work here?

22:00.076 --> 22:02.178
Part-time as a waitress.
I assumed she quit,

22:02.245 --> 22:04.096
'cause she's missed
her last three shifts.

22:04.181 --> 22:06.382
She's dead.

22:07.417 --> 22:08.601
Oh, my God.

22:08.685 --> 22:10.019
The guy.

22:10.086 --> 22:11.804
Look at him.
You know him?

22:11.888 --> 22:13.105
Um...

22:13.190 --> 22:14.890
no, I've never seen him.

22:14.942 --> 22:17.343
Okay, how about this guy,
Dennis Archer?

22:17.411 --> 22:18.894
Yeah.

22:18.946 --> 22:21.280
Yeah, yeah. He crashed
a luau the other night,

22:21.365 --> 22:24.033
looking for Bridgett.
Slugged one of my bouncers,

22:24.100 --> 22:25.267
scared away half the customers.

22:25.319 --> 22:27.870
I stepped in between
and got this.

22:27.937 --> 22:29.705
Really? Let me see that.

22:29.773 --> 22:31.324
Oh, he got you good.

22:31.408 --> 22:33.909
- So, what was it about, the fight?
- I have no idea.

22:33.961 --> 22:36.278
I warned her about getting
too close to the customers.

22:36.330 --> 22:37.730
♪ ♪

22:37.798 --> 22:40.216
So, how long did
you know Bridgett?

22:40.283 --> 22:41.751
- Couple of months.
- Okay, did she

22:41.802 --> 22:43.636
mention any kind of trouble
she was in recently?

22:43.720 --> 22:44.887
Yeah, she was having
money troubles.

22:44.954 --> 22:46.472
Really? Like she
didn't have any?

22:46.556 --> 22:50.092
No. Like her boyfriend-- Shane--
he's a massive loser sponge.

22:50.143 --> 22:51.560
Is this, uh...

22:51.628 --> 22:52.645
is that him?

22:52.729 --> 22:54.347
No, that's not him.

22:54.431 --> 22:56.415
And this photo,
that's just a tourist shot.

22:56.483 --> 22:58.067
See? For five bucks,
you can get

22:58.134 --> 23:00.936
a lei and a photo to show the folks
back on the mainland.

23:00.988 --> 23:02.521
That's nice.
Think I could get one?

23:02.606 --> 23:03.823
Yeah, for...

23:03.907 --> 23:06.108
five dollars.
- For five dollars, right. Okay.

23:06.159 --> 23:08.244
What about Shane?
Tell me about him.

23:08.311 --> 23:10.246
He was jealous,
and he had a temper.

23:10.313 --> 23:12.865
He didn't like her flirting
with the tourists, and like I said,

23:12.949 --> 23:14.283
he was always taking her money.

23:14.334 --> 23:15.918
Well, he sounds
like a nice guy.

23:15.985 --> 23:18.454
- You know where I could find him?
- Beach shack over in Kaelaeloa.

23:18.505 --> 23:20.623
Bridgett lost her apartment
and had to move in with him.

23:20.674 --> 23:22.792
Would you have an address
on the beach shack?

23:22.843 --> 23:25.878
<i>Shane! Five-O! Open up!</i>

23:32.803 --> 23:34.387
- Anybody else here?
- No.

23:34.471 --> 23:36.222
- You sure?
- Yeah, dude.

23:36.306 --> 23:37.690
Clear.

23:37.774 --> 23:39.108
Clear.

23:39.175 --> 23:41.360
All right, listen, I'm gonna
cut you free, all right?

23:41.445 --> 23:43.295
Don't move.

23:43.363 --> 23:44.814
Who tied you up
like this?

23:45.849 --> 23:46.899
Some guy.

23:46.983 --> 23:48.234
He took Bridgett.

23:48.318 --> 23:50.202
Look at this.

23:50.287 --> 23:52.204
Hey! This the guy?

23:52.289 --> 23:54.790
That's him. That's the guy
who took Bridgett.

23:54.858 --> 23:56.959
He had a gun,
and when I tried

23:57.026 --> 24:00.863
to stop him, he fired and killed
my favorite beer mirror, man.

24:02.416 --> 24:03.666
Huh?

24:04.835 --> 24:07.002
Hey. You listen up,

24:07.054 --> 24:08.220
you piece of garbage!

24:08.305 --> 24:11.307
Somebody shot Bridgett

24:11.374 --> 24:13.759
and stuffed her body
in the trunk of a car

24:13.844 --> 24:15.377
and you're worried about
a beer mirror?

24:15.429 --> 24:17.906
It wasn't me, man.
I was tied up!

24:17.907 --> 24:18.647
You know what I think it is?

24:18.648 --> 24:20.516
I think you were trying
to run a little scam

24:20.567 --> 24:22.017
on this guy
and it backfired, right?

24:22.069 --> 24:23.018
- Scam?
- Yeah.

24:23.070 --> 24:25.020
He shot my beer mirror, dude!

24:25.072 --> 24:27.406
- Your girlfriend's dead, all right?!
- Ow! Hey!

24:27.491 --> 24:29.442
Now, one more word

24:29.526 --> 24:32.244
out of you
about your misfortunes,

24:32.329 --> 24:34.747
and I guarantee you're gonna be
picking your teeth up off this floor, okay?

24:34.831 --> 24:36.615
What?

24:36.700 --> 24:38.617
Why don't you let us have a
little chat with him, okay?

24:38.702 --> 24:41.253
I got it. Um,

24:41.338 --> 24:43.205
what happened after he, uh...

24:43.256 --> 24:45.174
killed your beer mirror?

24:45.241 --> 24:47.710
I went... to grab the phone,

24:47.761 --> 24:50.596
and he hit me and
grabbed Bridgett.

24:50.680 --> 24:52.848
I tried to get up
and he clocked me again,

24:52.916 --> 24:54.467
and I was, like, out.

24:54.551 --> 24:57.219
Let me get this straight--
some guy breaks in here last night,

24:57.270 --> 25:00.306
kidnaps your girlfriend, you don't
know anything about it, nothing?

25:00.390 --> 25:01.807
He knew Bridgett.

25:01.892 --> 25:03.442
What do you mean?
Why do you say that?

25:03.527 --> 25:07.029
He kept saying that
she was lying to him.

25:07.096 --> 25:10.533
- She was lying to him about what?
- I don't know, but she was getting texts,

25:10.600 --> 25:12.318
and she was saying that

25:12.402 --> 25:14.904
- she was at work when she wasn't.
- What do you got?

25:15.939 --> 25:17.656
Got her cell phone.

25:17.741 --> 25:18.908
It's broke.

25:18.959 --> 25:20.326
All right, get it
back to the lab,

25:20.410 --> 25:21.744
pull the information off

25:21.795 --> 25:23.329
and maybe we'll find out
who Bridgett was texting, huh?

25:26.783 --> 25:28.884
<i>What'd you get</i>
<i>on Bridgett Turner?</i>

25:28.952 --> 25:32.338
Well, turns out she's clean-- she
dropped out of the drama program

25:32.422 --> 25:34.306
at UH, worked odd jobs
here and there.

25:34.391 --> 25:36.425
You find anything in the
hotel security footage?

25:36.476 --> 25:37.893
I did.
Looks like Archer

25:37.961 --> 25:40.146
had one visitor;
this was two days ago.

25:40.230 --> 25:42.765
All right. And there's
our Halliburton case,

25:42.816 --> 25:44.483
full of his life savings,
no doubt.

25:44.568 --> 25:46.435
And later on...

25:46.486 --> 25:48.136
Bridgett shows up.

25:48.188 --> 25:50.105
Some kind of exchange.

25:50.157 --> 25:52.474
Mm-hmm.

25:52.526 --> 25:54.577
All right, not for nothing, but they
don't look like a couple to me.

25:54.644 --> 25:55.828
Exactly. They're not.

25:55.912 --> 25:57.997
I mean, the way he greets her,
lack of intimacy--

25:58.081 --> 25:59.314
this definitely
was a business deal.

25:59.366 --> 26:01.316
Question is: What was he buying?
Right.

26:01.368 --> 26:03.118
Ransom. Blackmail payment.

26:03.170 --> 26:05.004
- For what?
- Well, he was there for over six hours,

26:05.088 --> 26:06.622
so whatever it was never came.

26:06.673 --> 26:09.758
So he buys a gun
and goes looking?

26:09.826 --> 26:11.627
Yeah?

26:11.678 --> 26:13.596
All right. All right,
we're on the way.

26:13.663 --> 26:16.131
Hey, Dennis Archer's wife has
just landed at the hospital.

26:16.183 --> 26:18.317
- Okay.
- Let's go.

26:20.187 --> 26:22.838
Ma'am, have you spoken
with the doctors?

26:22.889 --> 26:26.174
He's still in a coma, but they
said he's lucky to be alive.

26:26.226 --> 26:27.610
Okay, um,
your husband

26:27.677 --> 26:30.980
was here, um,
looking for... this woman.

26:31.031 --> 26:32.314
Her name is
Bridgett Turner.

26:32.365 --> 26:34.316
It was taken
at a Luau recently.

26:34.367 --> 26:35.367
Oh, my God.

26:35.452 --> 26:36.652
What?

26:36.703 --> 26:37.786
What? Do you know her?

26:39.188 --> 26:41.290
That... that's my son.

26:41.357 --> 26:43.792
What? That's your son?

26:43.860 --> 26:45.578
Sean.

26:45.662 --> 26:47.830
Okay, we're gonna need
to talk to him ma'am.

26:48.865 --> 26:51.217
That's impossible.

26:51.301 --> 26:52.835
Excuse me?
Why is that impossible?

26:52.886 --> 26:55.054
My son was murdered

26:55.138 --> 26:57.473
over two years ago.

27:03.853 --> 27:07.522
They found Sean's car
abandoned on the freeway.

27:07.780 --> 27:10.082
There were signs of foul play...

27:10.149 --> 27:14.836
and we searched
and searched, and...

27:14.921 --> 27:16.955
we never found his body.

27:17.006 --> 27:18.340
The police have

27:18.424 --> 27:20.959
any leads or any motive, anything?
- No.

27:21.010 --> 27:25.380
They said it was random,
just one of those things.

27:25.465 --> 27:27.716
Okay. Is that why your
husband came to Hawaii,

27:27.800 --> 27:29.121
to look for your son?

27:29.146 --> 27:31.228
Well, if it was,
he didn't tell me.

27:31.270 --> 27:33.722
We... we offered

27:33.806 --> 27:36.508
a-a reward;
we set up a Web site

27:36.559 --> 27:40.195
for any information from anybody
that knew what happened to Sean.

27:40.279 --> 27:41.530
Web site?

27:41.614 --> 27:42.864
Your husband's idea?

27:42.949 --> 27:45.617
No. It was both
of ours at first.

27:47.153 --> 27:50.122
And, uh, people
would give us tips

27:50.189 --> 27:53.075
that they'd seen him
in Bali or Atlanta

27:53.159 --> 27:56.161
and they just...
turned out to be lies.

27:56.212 --> 27:57.462
Yeah.
But, um,

27:57.530 --> 27:59.665
your husband, he still believed?

28:00.717 --> 28:02.084
Yeah, quietly, yes.

28:02.168 --> 28:04.086
He... he didn't talk
to me about it,

28:04.170 --> 28:06.037
because he knew
that it upset me.

28:06.089 --> 28:08.473
It was easier just...

28:08.541 --> 28:10.509
just to believe he was dead.

28:10.560 --> 28:12.877
I know that sounds horrible,
it's just...

28:12.929 --> 28:14.930
it's just the truth.

28:16.983 --> 28:18.734
I understand.

28:18.818 --> 28:20.902
Listen, did your husband
get a tip

28:20.987 --> 28:23.071
that Sean was in Hawaii,
is that what happened?

28:23.156 --> 28:24.606
Is that why he
came out here?

28:24.691 --> 28:27.025
If he did, it would
be on the Web site.

28:27.076 --> 28:29.578
Um, we're gonna need
that Web address, ma'am,

28:29.662 --> 28:32.063
and any passcodes
to any chat rooms, okay?

28:32.115 --> 28:33.699
Okay.

28:35.735 --> 28:38.203
Is it possible that, um...

28:38.254 --> 28:40.789
that my son still
could be alive?

28:40.873 --> 28:43.258
We certainly hope so,
and we're gonna do everything we can

28:43.342 --> 28:44.960
to find out.

28:45.044 --> 28:46.511
Absolutely.

28:46.579 --> 28:48.680
Excuse me, Sharon,
could I take

28:48.748 --> 28:50.582
a look at that again?

28:50.633 --> 28:51.717
Thank you.

28:51.768 --> 28:52.934
Excuse me.

28:54.854 --> 28:56.588
What do you got?

28:56.639 --> 28:59.307
We got to get this
analyzed by SIS. Look.

28:59.392 --> 29:02.110
- What?
- Something's off with the lighting.

29:02.195 --> 29:04.780
Looks like the sun's
coming from two places.

29:04.864 --> 29:06.531
Yeah, you're right.

29:08.868 --> 29:11.858
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:11.859 --> 29:13.438
Did you find anything
on the Web site?

29:13.439 --> 29:14.773
Actually, we just finished

29:14.824 --> 29:16.441
going through the tip-line
and e-mail logs.

29:16.492 --> 29:18.627
A week before Dennis Archer
came to Hawaii,

29:18.711 --> 29:19.995
he got an e-mail
from Bridgett Turner,

29:20.079 --> 29:21.213
and she claimed to have met

29:21.280 --> 29:22.998
his son Sean
and that he was living

29:23.066 --> 29:24.499
- under an assumed name.
- Okay.

29:24.567 --> 29:26.284
Let me guess, she sent
the photo as proof.

29:26.335 --> 29:27.969
Right. Then there's this.

29:30.056 --> 29:32.290
"Sean is in trouble with
the Kapu, a local surf gang.

29:32.341 --> 29:33.958
"He owes them money,
and I'm afraid

29:34.010 --> 29:35.794
something bad has happened to him."
- Yes, in subsequent

29:35.845 --> 29:38.146
e-mails, Bridgett said that
the Kapu had taken Sean

29:38.231 --> 29:39.514
and that they
were demanding money.

29:39.599 --> 29:40.632
So the old man hops
the first plane,

29:40.683 --> 29:42.400
drains his account to
ransom his son back.

29:42.468 --> 29:44.871
Yeah. So maybe Sean Archer
has something to hide from

29:44.896 --> 29:46.021
back on the mainland.

29:46.022 --> 29:47.689
He gets involved with
this Bridgett girl,

29:47.774 --> 29:50.809
he goes back to his old ways and
gets in trouble with the Kapu.

29:50.860 --> 29:53.478
Let's go talk to the Kapu.

29:53.529 --> 29:55.864
Okay. But we can't go
at these guys head-on.

29:55.948 --> 29:57.866
We got to go through
Kawika, their leader.

29:57.950 --> 30:00.669
I got a badge says I can do
whatever I want.

30:06.926 --> 30:09.544
I got all night, man.

30:09.629 --> 30:11.379
Bring it.

30:11.464 --> 30:14.049
You threatening me?

30:14.133 --> 30:15.884
- I want my call.
- No.

30:15.968 --> 30:18.687
You ain't getting a call.

30:18.771 --> 30:20.555
You ain't getting nothin'.

30:21.607 --> 30:24.175
Unless you talk to me.

30:24.227 --> 30:26.645
Where is Sean Archer?

30:29.782 --> 30:31.366
Hey.

30:31.450 --> 30:33.017
What the hell
you doing?

30:33.069 --> 30:35.403
I'm in the middle
of interrogating here.

30:36.405 --> 30:39.040
Yeah, well,
we did it your way.

30:40.076 --> 30:42.711
- Now it's my turn.
- Wow.

30:42.795 --> 30:44.045
Really? Is that so?

30:44.130 --> 30:46.081
He's not gonna
give you anything.

30:46.165 --> 30:47.299
Right, Kawika?

30:47.366 --> 30:49.467
True that.

30:49.535 --> 30:51.553
You're kidding.

30:51.637 --> 30:54.539
Okay, look,
you got five minutes, Kono.

30:54.590 --> 30:56.558
Not six.

30:56.642 --> 30:58.143
Five.

31:05.017 --> 31:08.236
I'm sorry about
Captain Fryer, Kawika.

31:08.321 --> 31:09.654
You're free to go.

31:12.942 --> 31:15.493
What's the catch?

31:17.613 --> 31:20.231
Have you seen
these folks before?

31:22.902 --> 31:25.620
Look, I'll tell you
like I told that cop.

31:25.705 --> 31:27.906
I was at a Mauli Ola
event all week.

31:27.957 --> 31:29.240
Okay, but...

31:29.292 --> 31:31.176
so no?

31:35.514 --> 31:37.916
That's that girl
that got killed.

31:37.967 --> 31:40.302
She worked at
the Paradise Cove Luau,

31:40.386 --> 31:42.637
right?
- Yeah. You know her?

31:42.722 --> 31:44.105
No.

31:44.190 --> 31:47.091
But I know there's some
shady stuff going on down there.

31:47.143 --> 31:50.562
Scamming tourists,
stuff like that.

31:56.101 --> 31:58.203
Hey, this whole thing's a scam.

31:58.270 --> 31:59.454
What do you mean?

31:59.538 --> 32:00.705
The photo Bridgett
sent of Sean?

32:00.773 --> 32:02.941
She used a photo
from the Web site to make it.

32:02.992 --> 32:04.108
It's a fake.

32:04.160 --> 32:06.328
Let's see what you got.

32:06.412 --> 32:08.613
Questioned Documents confirmed
it's the same photo.

32:08.664 --> 32:11.166
So somebody manipulated it
and grafted it onto

32:11.250 --> 32:12.500
a tourist shop from the luau--
Chin's working on

32:12.585 --> 32:14.452
who sent it.
- Okay, but we still don't know

32:14.503 --> 32:15.787
if Sean is alive or dead.

32:15.838 --> 32:16.955
Right. And I'm
guessing Bridgett

32:17.006 --> 32:18.306
and whoever
she was working for

32:18.391 --> 32:19.641
doesn't, either.
And the Web site

32:19.725 --> 32:21.009
provided all the
info they needed.

32:21.093 --> 32:23.011
Right.
They preyed on their hope.

32:25.631 --> 32:28.299
Hey. I managed to reconstruct
Bridgett's cell phone

32:28.351 --> 32:30.151
and traced the photo
she sent to the Web site.

32:30.236 --> 32:31.636
Looks like it was e-mailed
to her phone.

32:31.687 --> 32:33.688
Bridgett's accomplice
then doctored the photo

32:33.773 --> 32:34.823
and had her make contact

32:34.907 --> 32:36.491
with the family.

32:36.575 --> 32:38.410
Did we trace the I.P. address?

32:38.477 --> 32:41.029
E-mail was sent from a laptop
belonging to Mitch Kolat.

32:41.113 --> 32:43.331
Bridgett's manager
at the luau.

32:43.416 --> 32:45.667
Mm-hmm. Turns out Kolat's
got a record, too.

32:45.751 --> 32:47.419
He did five years for wire fraud

32:47.486 --> 32:48.920
and cyber crimes
on the mainland.

32:48.988 --> 32:50.255
We got our guy.

33:02.784 --> 33:03.718
Five-O!

33:03.719 --> 33:05.737
Hold it right there!

33:17.065 --> 33:20.335
Damn, Kono.

33:20.836 --> 33:22.954
Nice work.

33:25.341 --> 33:27.942
<i>So, we got you</i>

33:28.010 --> 33:29.427
for the murder
of Bridgett Turner

33:29.512 --> 33:30.678
and the attempted murder

33:30.746 --> 33:32.013
of Dennis Archer.

33:32.080 --> 33:33.631
Your plan was to

33:33.716 --> 33:37.051
shoot Bridgett and pin
it on Dennis, right?

33:37.103 --> 33:39.471
I didn't plan
on murdering anybody.

33:39.555 --> 33:40.889
Oh, really?

33:40.940 --> 33:43.475
'Cause we got e-mails
detailing the entire scam,

33:43.559 --> 33:44.976
and that makes it premeditated.

33:45.060 --> 33:47.529
That along with
your previous record, and

33:47.596 --> 33:49.814
you're gonna be inside for the
rest of your natural born life.

33:51.951 --> 33:53.151
That's true, isn't it?

33:53.235 --> 33:55.954
Hey, you do it
for the money?

33:56.021 --> 33:57.789
- Huh?
- Seemed like an easy score.

33:57.873 --> 34:00.508
It was easy, but Archer
figured it out, didn't he?

34:00.576 --> 34:02.544
He figured out
his son wasn't actually alive.

34:02.611 --> 34:04.996
He wouldn't let it go.

34:05.064 --> 34:08.166
He came at me with a gun
demanding to know the truth.

34:08.250 --> 34:10.635
I took it from him,
and I shot him.

34:10.719 --> 34:12.003
Why not?

34:19.645 --> 34:20.812
But what about the girl?

34:20.896 --> 34:23.348
All she had to do
was keep her mouth shut.

34:23.431 --> 34:25.183
All right? He got to her,

34:25.266 --> 34:27.268
she gave me up.

34:27.319 --> 34:29.938
She said she felt bad
about what she had done.

34:29.989 --> 34:31.773
You mean lie to that family

34:31.824 --> 34:33.824
and tell them that their son was
alive? You talking about that?

34:33.909 --> 34:36.310
It's what they wanted to hear.

34:36.362 --> 34:39.614
Yeah? So, how'd
you pick them?

34:39.665 --> 34:40.915
Hmm?

34:40.983 --> 34:43.117
I shared a cell
with this guy in Arizona

34:43.168 --> 34:45.003
who was always
bragging about

34:45.087 --> 34:46.838
all the stuff that he
had gotten away with.

34:46.922 --> 34:49.123
One of them was
this guy he killed.

34:49.175 --> 34:50.708
Hmm.

34:53.012 --> 34:55.013
Sean Archer?

34:55.097 --> 34:58.716
Yeah. He said nobody
had ever solved the crime.

34:58.801 --> 35:00.685
He even told me where
he buried the body.

35:00.769 --> 35:02.770
Why'd he kill him?

35:02.838 --> 35:05.557
For kicks.

35:05.624 --> 35:07.675
I don't know.
The guy's a total psychopath.

35:09.678 --> 35:13.014
That still doesn't explain
why you'd contact the family.

35:15.017 --> 35:17.869
When I got out,
I looked up the murder,

35:17.953 --> 35:20.788
and that's when I saw
the reward they were offering.

35:20.856 --> 35:22.356
Did it ever occur to you

35:22.408 --> 35:24.876
that you might actually
be able to help this family?

35:24.960 --> 35:26.878
- I thought about it.
- Oh, you thought about it.

35:26.962 --> 35:29.497
Yeah, I figured if they were
willing to pay that much

35:29.548 --> 35:31.633
just to find some bones
buried in the desert,

35:31.700 --> 35:33.251
imagine what they'd pay
if they thought

35:33.335 --> 35:34.502
their son was still alive.

35:36.338 --> 35:38.673
So you get Bridgett
to tell the family

35:38.724 --> 35:40.708
the son disappeared
to Hawaii, right?

35:40.759 --> 35:42.877
Yeah. She
needed the money.

35:42.928 --> 35:45.096
I needed a pretty face
to sell the story.

35:45.180 --> 35:46.814
Needy people. I need things,
too. You know what I need?

35:46.882 --> 35:49.550
I need you to tell me

35:49.602 --> 35:53.738
the name of that guy,
you know, in Arizona.

35:53.822 --> 35:55.890
And I need you to tell me

35:55.941 --> 35:58.826
right now.

35:58.894 --> 36:01.195
Yeah, see, I know
I'm going back in, so...

36:01.247 --> 36:02.730
Oh, yeah.

36:02.781 --> 36:04.899
...I don't know why
I'd tell you that name.

36:04.950 --> 36:06.067
I'm no snitch.

36:06.118 --> 36:07.835
Oh, he's no snitch.

36:07.903 --> 36:09.454
He's an honorable guy.

36:10.506 --> 36:12.173
I understand.

36:12.240 --> 36:16.094
But you know, the question
you got to ask yourself is, um,

36:16.178 --> 36:20.581
how are you gonna spend
this life sentence?

36:20.633 --> 36:22.684
Okay? Because if you don't
cooperate with me

36:22.751 --> 36:25.970
right now, right here,
I will call the warden,

36:26.055 --> 36:28.273
and I will have him
enroll your ass

36:28.357 --> 36:31.759
in the psycho
of the week program.

36:31.810 --> 36:33.594
Every week,

36:33.646 --> 36:35.863
you get to-to sample

36:35.931 --> 36:39.317
the prison's finest psychopaths,

36:39.401 --> 36:42.436
gangbangers, sociopaths.

36:42.488 --> 36:44.939
And you get to do it
for the rest...

36:44.990 --> 36:47.325
of your life

36:47.409 --> 36:49.911
until you leave there
in a box.

36:53.615 --> 36:55.550
Richard Lack.

36:55.617 --> 36:57.802
Hmm?

36:57.886 --> 36:59.887
Richard Lack.

37:03.559 --> 37:05.059
Good luck getting him
to confess.

37:05.127 --> 37:06.728
- He's doing double life.
- Really?

37:06.795 --> 37:08.096
Leave that up to me, okay?

37:08.147 --> 37:09.897
And I got some friends
in the FBI.

37:09.965 --> 37:11.265
They're pretty good
at their job.

37:11.317 --> 37:12.483
They'll make it a priority.

37:20.025 --> 37:22.910
Richard Lack--
doing double life

37:22.978 --> 37:24.495
for killing a
family in Arizona.

37:24.580 --> 37:26.647
Did your FBI
friend get Lack

37:26.699 --> 37:28.666
to confirm Kolat's story?

37:28.751 --> 37:31.502
Guy practically
bragged about it.

37:31.587 --> 37:34.488
He'll be tried for the murder
of Sean Archer.

37:34.540 --> 37:37.158
We get the location
of Sean Archer's body?

37:37.209 --> 37:39.177
Oh, we got it all.

37:39.261 --> 37:40.828
The body and the knife he used.

37:40.879 --> 37:43.998
They were also able to pull
Lack's DNA from it, so...

37:48.053 --> 37:50.054
Did he say why he did it?

37:50.139 --> 37:54.842
Yeah. Just that Sean picked him
up hitchhiking, and, uh...

37:54.893 --> 37:56.894
he felt like it.

37:59.681 --> 38:01.065
Hey.

38:01.150 --> 38:03.534
Dennis Archer came out
of his coma.

38:03.619 --> 38:05.903
He's gonna be
asking questions.

38:05.988 --> 38:08.322
Sharon and Dennis Archer deserve
to know the truth

38:08.374 --> 38:10.375
