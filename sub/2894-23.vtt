WEBVTT

00:00.233 --> 00:02.434
Iron man:
<i>Okay. Now, sam...</i>

00:02.436 --> 00:03.769
Nice and slow.

00:03.771 --> 00:06.171
Just like
we practiced.

00:06.173 --> 00:08.474
Steady.
(whirring)

00:08.476 --> 00:11.043
Steady.

00:11.045 --> 00:13.545
(clattering)

00:13.547 --> 00:16.047
(clattering)

00:16.050 --> 00:17.549
(phone vibrating)

00:17.551 --> 00:19.351
That's not annoying
at all.

00:19.353 --> 00:20.652
Yeah, I know, tony.

00:20.654 --> 00:23.055
Sorry, I forgot.
Just ignore it.

00:23.057 --> 00:24.623
Sure, ignore it.

00:24.625 --> 00:28.193
We're just trying
to dispose of highly
unstable pym particles.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.762
No big.

00:29.764 --> 00:31.797
Why get your armor
in a bunch

00:31.799 --> 00:33.799
Over puny particles?

00:33.801 --> 00:37.770
Because if these
puny particles escape
that containment unit,

00:37.772 --> 00:41.173
They might just shrink
everything on earth
at the speed of light,

00:41.175 --> 00:43.108
Including the earth itself,

00:43.110 --> 00:47.713
To the size of a dot,
and that would be bad.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.449
(whirring)

00:50.451 --> 00:52.084
(clattering)

00:52.086 --> 00:52.084
What if it's
an emergency?

00:52.086 --> 00:56.321
This will be an emergency
if you don't focus.

00:56.323 --> 00:58.057
(phone vibrates)

00:58.059 --> 00:59.358
I can get it.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.360
(thumping)
no!

01:01.362 --> 01:02.661
I just bought it.

01:02.663 --> 01:05.297
I won't smash it. I have
a phone too, you know.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.332
(thuds)

01:07.334 --> 01:09.668
Yeah. It's built
to withstand a gamma bomb.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.438
Which my phone
is not... Happening!

01:12.440 --> 01:15.107
Uh, I gotta go!

01:15.109 --> 01:18.210
Falcon,
I need you in here.

01:18.212 --> 01:19.678
I can get that.
No!

01:19.680 --> 01:21.647
We need you on
the containment unit.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.649
Any sudden movements
can cause...

01:23.651 --> 01:33.292
(phone ringing)

01:33.294 --> 01:34.660
Whoa.

01:34.662 --> 01:46.238
Ant-man!

01:46.240 --> 01:48.307
Whew!
"come to my lab,"
you said.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.842
"what's safer than
the tower," you said.

01:49.844 --> 01:51.810
Did new york just
have an earthquake?

01:51.812 --> 01:54.346
Nah, just my phone.
I'm popular.

01:54.348 --> 01:57.182
I say, "help me dispose
of unstable mass
altering particles,"

01:57.184 --> 01:59.318
And you bring in a newbie
and meat-hooks mcgee.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.153
I'm supposed
to stay subatomic,

02:01.155 --> 02:03.822
Make sure none of
the particles escape.

02:03.824 --> 02:06.125
Like that one?

02:06.127 --> 02:07.826
Don't move, hulk.

02:07.828 --> 02:10.662
(chuckles)
tingles.

02:10.663 --> 02:13.132
Hulk!
(alarm beeps)

02:13.134 --> 02:15.601
Jarvis: <i> Sir, there's</i>
<i>a pym particle loose.</i>

02:15.603 --> 02:18.370
Not to mention,
a teeny tiny hulk.

02:18.372 --> 02:20.372
That's a recipe
for disaster.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.441
You're never going
to let me live this
down, are you?

02:22.443 --> 02:24.243
No.
No, I'm not.

02:24.245 --> 02:27.779
Guys, emergency.
Don't panic.
It's my mother.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.648
She's here.

02:29.650 --> 02:33.418
(sighs)
it's going to be
one of those days.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:45.899 --> 02:47.466
What's the emergency?

02:47.468 --> 02:49.601
My mom's on her way.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.203
We have an alarm
for that?

02:51.205 --> 02:53.705
Or the hulk was
accidentally shrunk down

02:53.707 --> 02:55.807
By an unstable
pym particle.

02:55.809 --> 02:59.244
Thanks to falcon fielding
phone calls from his mom.

02:59.246 --> 03:00.779
So, watch where you step.
(steps thump)

03:00.781 --> 03:02.948
Ant-man,
no one told me

03:02.950 --> 03:05.918
The incredible shrinking
annoyance was coming in today.

03:05.920 --> 03:05.918
Hawkeye...

03:05.920 --> 03:10.822
Unless you want to spend
a day inside of your own
smelly boot again...

03:10.824 --> 03:12.591
Why don't you let
the past be the past

03:12.593 --> 03:14.760
And do something useful?

03:14.762 --> 03:15.827
(beeps)

03:15.829 --> 03:17.329
(whirring)

03:17.331 --> 03:18.931
Whoa!

03:18.933 --> 03:21.366
(grunts)
like that.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.869
(groans)
I guess I found
the hulk.

03:23.871 --> 03:27.806
Ooh! You were just taken
to the learning hall.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.875
It's school.

03:29.877 --> 03:33.612
Indeed, and it was
"in session."

03:33.614 --> 03:34.846
Hmm?
(groans)

03:34.848 --> 03:36.882
I can shrink down
and get him back to size,

03:36.884 --> 03:38.784
But more importantly,
we have to contain

03:38.786 --> 03:41.687
That unstable particle
or bad things will happen.

03:41.689 --> 03:43.488
(doorbell rings)

03:43.490 --> 03:44.890
We have a doorbell?

03:44.892 --> 03:46.925
It's too late.
She's here!

03:46.927 --> 03:48.894
Why the great concern?

03:48.896 --> 03:51.897
You don't understand.
She doesn't know
I'm an avenger.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.865
My mom thinks
I'm just
a s.H.I.E.L.D. Liaison.

03:53.867 --> 03:56.668
She'd make me quit,
knowing the danger
I'm always in.

03:56.670 --> 03:59.338
Make you?
(chuckles)
how old are you?

03:59.340 --> 04:01.974
The irony is,
the more we worry
about mom,

04:01.976 --> 04:04.309
The less we actually
have to worry,

04:04.311 --> 04:07.279
Because there won't
be a world

04:07.281 --> 04:08.914
Or a mom

04:08.916 --> 04:10.682
To worry about.

04:10.684 --> 04:14.753
Tony, I'm...
Out.

04:14.755 --> 04:18.957
Whoo, man!
You were totally taken
to the learning hall.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.892
I've never seen him
that angry before.

04:20.894 --> 04:20.892
Well, to be fair,
you almost let earth

04:20.894 --> 04:24.963
Shrink out of existence
over a lie to your mother.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.798
Right!
I gotta get changed.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.400
Cover me!
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.936
We are not lying
to your mom...

04:30.938 --> 04:33.872
Without getting
something out of it.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.974
Ugh, what do you want?

04:35.976 --> 04:40.479
Nothin', but the next time
your mom makes cookies

04:40.481 --> 04:43.282
I want first dibs.

04:43.284 --> 04:46.685
Hmm, nothing on
the gamma energy scans.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.420
Yeah, he's too small.

04:48.422 --> 04:49.855
I'll shrink in
and get a reading.

04:49.857 --> 04:52.791
Find hulk and the particle
can't be far behind.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.559
With this adaptor,
I can hold the particle

04:54.561 --> 04:56.862
Long enough to get into
the containment unit.

04:56.864 --> 05:03.802
Don't worry. We'll have this
wrapped up as fast as you
can say, "hi, falcon's mom."

05:03.804 --> 05:05.937
(grunting)

05:05.939 --> 05:08.974
I would strongly advise you
to rethink your course
of action, sam.

05:08.976 --> 05:08.974
(grunts)

05:08.976 --> 05:12.844
Honesty is
the best policy.
(whimpers)

05:12.846 --> 05:14.846
Rip the bandage off
and get it over with.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.682
(grunts)
not this time, cap.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.650
I never told her
I became the falcon.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.452
If I do now,
I'm done.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.954
Finito.
(whimpers)

05:22.956 --> 05:26.024
Don't worry.
Your secret's
safe with me.

05:26.026 --> 05:29.795
As long as you remember
our deal about the cookies.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.697
And what do you want?

05:31.699 --> 05:34.399
Nothing. I have similar
figurehead issues

05:34.401 --> 05:35.834
With all-father odin.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.803
I feel you.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.871
(gasps) you actually used
that slang correctly.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.106
Cold.
Cool.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.008
Yes.
(groans)

05:43.010 --> 05:45.977
Okay.
I'm going in.

05:45.979 --> 05:49.715
(inhales)

05:49.717 --> 05:50.882
(dings)

05:50.884 --> 05:53.352
Sam, I hope this
is a good time.

05:53.354 --> 05:55.554
The best.
Avengers, my mom.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.723
Mom, the avengers.
'kay, let's go.

05:57.725 --> 05:58.790
Are you kidding?

05:58.792 --> 06:00.926
I want to see
where you work,

06:00.928 --> 06:04.930
And I have to get
a picture of my boy
with real avengers.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.732
You remember when
you used to pose

06:06.734 --> 06:08.100
With those
cardboard cutouts.

06:08.102 --> 06:11.403
(chuckles) yeah.
You sure we can't
just go do lunch?

06:11.405 --> 06:14.706
Are those cookies?
(laughs)
(camera flashes)

06:14.708 --> 06:17.409
Nanobot:
<i>Commence cleansing.</i>
Iron man: Any hits?

06:17.411 --> 06:19.711
Yeah, I'm following
a pretty strong signal.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.980
If I can just get past
your germaphobe-a-bots.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.915
Yeah. I live with
the hulk, remember?

06:23.917 --> 06:27.052
The nano-janitors keep
the tower springtime fresh.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.920
(crashing)
point taken.

06:28.922 --> 06:32.691
And speaking of,
I think I found
our green goliath.

06:32.693 --> 06:34.593
And the particle.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.128
(hulk roaring)

06:36.130 --> 06:38.397
(grunting)
smash cleaning robots!

06:38.399 --> 06:39.664
(screams)

06:39.666 --> 06:41.166
Easy, hulk.
Just one second,

06:41.168 --> 06:42.868
And we'll have you
back to normal.

06:42.870 --> 06:45.137
Nanobot:
<i>Contaminant found.</i>
<i>Neutralizing.</i>

06:45.139 --> 06:47.005
Get back here,
blue dot!

06:47.007 --> 06:56.681
(grunts)
hulk, no!

06:56.683 --> 06:57.983
Tell me you got
the particle.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.418
Yeah, he got it.

06:59.420 --> 07:09.895
And now,
"it" is "them."

07:09.897 --> 07:15.500
We're in trouble.
Oh, boy.

07:15.502 --> 07:22.841
Aw, you gotta
be kiddin' me!

07:22.843 --> 07:25.677
Why do you not just
wash it down with water?

07:25.679 --> 07:28.547
You can't wash cookies
down with water!

07:28.549 --> 07:29.981
It's gotta be milk!

07:29.983 --> 07:31.917
Milk or nothin'!

07:31.919 --> 07:33.618
(grunts)

07:33.620 --> 07:35.821
(gulps)
worth it.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.989
Sam has told me
so much about you.

07:37.991 --> 07:40.025
I feel like
I know you all.

07:40.027 --> 07:42.227
You're the one
who thinks he's funny.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.663
Captain america
keeps his room neat

07:44.665 --> 07:46.865
And likes his
french fries lined up.

07:46.867 --> 07:51.803
And you're the one that
sheds his yellow locks
all over the place.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.738
Well, you know,
as a liaison,

07:53.740 --> 07:56.141
I liaise, which means
noticing the details.

07:56.143 --> 07:59.177
(chuckles nervously)
where is that
cookie-hogging hulk?

07:59.179 --> 08:02.013
I made him a whole
separate batch of treats.

08:02.015 --> 08:06.885
And I brought mints.
I hear he suffers
from chronic halitosis.

08:06.887 --> 08:09.754
(chuckles)
hey, how about
another picture?

08:09.756 --> 08:11.490
Then, maybe we can
go get lunch before

08:11.492 --> 08:13.091
You say something else
that'll get me fired.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.694
Sam wilson,
if I didn't know
any better,

08:15.696 --> 08:18.563
I'd say you were trying
to hustle me out of here.

08:18.565 --> 08:20.065
Uh, guys...

08:20.067 --> 08:22.868
Just press the button
and they'll be a big flash.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.102
That's what
I'm worried about.

08:27.273 --> 08:29.241
How bad is it?

08:29.243 --> 08:32.577
(rumbling)
thanks to
mr. Anger management...

08:32.578 --> 08:32.577
(grunts)

08:32.578 --> 08:37.849
We have an unknown number
of unstable particles loose
in the tower.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.852
I can't predict their effects,
their location... Anything!

08:40.854 --> 08:42.888
We need to vacuum them
into the containment unit

08:42.890 --> 08:44.723
Before they escape
the building.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.758
Jarvis, tower lockdown.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.794
Pass code,
"I heart ascots."

08:49.796 --> 08:49.794
What?

08:49.796 --> 08:52.864
I'd never be caught dead
saying those words

08:52.866 --> 08:52.864
Unless it's
an emergency.

08:52.866 --> 08:57.569
The warmer the color
temperature, the easier
the particles are to see.

08:57.571 --> 09:00.272
Jarvis, turn the lights
to 2000 kelvin.

09:00.274 --> 09:09.147
(buzzes)

09:09.149 --> 09:10.882
Where do
those vents go?

09:10.884 --> 09:12.984
Everywhere.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.120
Nanobot:
<i>Contaminant found.</i>
<i>Neutralizing.</i>

09:15.122 --> 09:16.821
<i>Commence cleaning.</i>
(grunts)

09:16.823 --> 09:19.691
<i>Contaminant found.</i>
<i>Neutralizing.</i>
(laser blast)

09:19.693 --> 09:20.926
What's going on?

09:20.928 --> 09:22.127
Oh, yeah. That...

09:22.129 --> 09:24.029
It's called,
"spontaneous training."

09:24.031 --> 09:25.931
Yeah, guys do it
all the time

09:25.933 --> 09:27.265
To keep them
on their toes.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.834
(glass breaking)
so, how about lunch?

09:29.836 --> 09:31.236
(rumbling)
(grunts)

09:31.238 --> 09:33.872
<i>Contaminant found.</i>
<i>Neutraliz...</i>
(explodes)

09:33.874 --> 09:37.075
Are those my
nano-janitors?

09:37.077 --> 09:39.611
Maybe you should get
some air fresheners

09:39.613 --> 09:43.248
Or an off switch.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.017
<i>Contaminant found...</i>
<i>Contaminant neutralizing...</i>

09:46.019 --> 09:47.819
(roars)

09:47.821 --> 09:49.187
(grunts)
(thuds)

09:49.189 --> 09:50.855
(grunts)
<i>contaminant found.</i>

09:50.857 --> 09:53.625
(explodes)

09:53.627 --> 09:55.293
(whirring)

09:55.295 --> 09:57.862
Because of their instability,
I can only contain so many

09:57.864 --> 10:03.068
Pym particles at a time
with this rig.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.203
All right,
here's the recap.

10:05.205 --> 10:08.173
Hulk smashed an unstable
pym particle. It multiplied.

10:08.175 --> 10:10.942
Yellow makes things big.
Blue makes things small.

10:10.944 --> 10:15.614
Second biggest brain
on the team needed in the lab.
Let's go.

10:15.616 --> 10:18.116
Oh, your mom.
Yeah. Sorry, sam.

10:18.118 --> 10:18.116
No time for tact.

10:18.118 --> 10:21.386
Mrs. Wilson, your son's
a part of our team.

10:21.388 --> 10:24.155
He's... (screams)
(laser blast)

10:24.157 --> 10:26.625
This doesn't
seem safe at all.

10:26.627 --> 10:32.864
And-and what did he mean,
part of the team?

10:32.866 --> 10:34.866
Tony meant that
I'm a team player.

10:34.868 --> 10:39.070
You know, always
helping out with...
Whatever.

10:39.072 --> 10:42.207
Sam, man up,
and let's go!

10:42.209 --> 10:44.909
Mom, I have something
to tell you.

10:44.911 --> 10:50.849
Get down!

10:50.851 --> 10:53.885
And there goes our expert
on all things shrinking.

10:53.887 --> 11:00.925
(clattering)

11:00.927 --> 11:05.163
(sighs) and this is why
I prefer to work with ants.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.265
(beeps)

11:07.267 --> 11:08.933
Not good.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.035
(grunts)

11:10.037 --> 11:14.005
(grunts)
<i>commence...</i>

11:14.007 --> 11:18.143
(whirring)

11:18.145 --> 11:20.278
Stark, the unstable
pym particles

11:20.280 --> 11:21.946
<i>Are overriding</i>
<i>my stable ones.</i>

11:21.948 --> 11:23.715
<i>I can't resize.</i>

11:23.717 --> 11:26.885
<i>I'm stuck until you siphon</i>
<i>the unstable energy off of me.</i>

11:26.887 --> 11:30.822
Of course.

11:30.824 --> 11:33.925
Mrs. Wilson is a civilian.
We need to get her to safety.

11:33.927 --> 11:37.829
Hawkeye, falcon...
Uh, cap, falcon's
not here, remember?

11:37.831 --> 11:39.197
Oh, brother.
Just do it!

11:39.199 --> 11:46.037
Retreat to the hallway.
I got you... (screams)

11:46.039 --> 11:49.908
(rumbling)
(screams)

11:49.910 --> 11:49.908
That ain't right.

11:49.910 --> 11:53.044
And don't even try
to tell me that's normal.
(rumbling)

11:53.046 --> 11:57.482
Mom, run!
(whimpers)

11:57.484 --> 12:04.255
Aah!

12:04.257 --> 12:06.758
Crazy training
exercise, huh?

12:06.760 --> 12:08.727
Feels pretty real.

12:08.729 --> 12:09.928
(scoffs)
oh, sam.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.996
You are a lot
of amazing things,

12:11.998 --> 12:14.199
A liar isn't
one of them.

12:14.201 --> 12:22.941
Spill it!

12:22.943 --> 12:24.776
Ah...

12:24.778 --> 12:26.044
Look out!
(screams)

12:26.046 --> 12:31.416
Sam!

12:31.418 --> 12:33.485
Mom!
Ah!

12:33.487 --> 12:37.021
(roars)

12:37.023 --> 12:38.456
Heard screams.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.092
Mom!

12:41.094 --> 12:43.928
Oh. All good?

12:43.930 --> 12:45.430
Very.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.899
(coughs)
wow.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.868
This is one
for the blog.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.971
Here, for my new
favorite avenger.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.906
Cookies! Yes!

12:54.908 --> 12:59.310
Oh, thanks,
sam's mom.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.246
We gotta get you
somewhere safe!

13:01.248 --> 13:01.246
But what about
the hulk?

13:01.248 --> 13:05.784
Trust me when I say,
hulk can take care
of himself.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.952
Come on!
(yelps)
slow down, sam.

13:07.954 --> 13:13.558
I'm in heels!

13:13.560 --> 13:21.166
Hmm.
Save you for last.

13:21.168 --> 13:24.936
(grunts)

13:24.938 --> 13:27.405
(clanks)

13:27.407 --> 13:31.943
Well,
this is humiliating.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.311
<i>Target acquired...</i>
(grunts)

13:33.313 --> 13:35.013
<i>Cleaning!</i>
<i>Cleaning!</i>

13:35.015 --> 13:38.316
<i>Neutralizing.</i>

13:38.318 --> 13:43.154
(grunting)

13:43.156 --> 13:45.323
Oh, good.
You're alive.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.493
(chuckles)
I thought I crushed you
with my, uh, assets.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.929
Mom, stay here
with hawkeye, please.

13:50.931 --> 13:55.033
Just for a second
while I ask mr. Stark
how to get out of here.

13:55.035 --> 13:58.570
(grunts)

13:58.572 --> 14:00.972
<i>Contaminant found.</i>
Ah!

14:00.974 --> 14:03.241
Hawkeye smash!

14:03.243 --> 14:05.343
Nice!

14:05.345 --> 14:09.013
So, any embarrassing
stories about sam

14:09.015 --> 14:12.283
You'd like to share
while, uh, we're...

14:12.285 --> 14:14.352
Training?

14:14.354 --> 14:17.989
Hmm.
(chuckles)

14:17.991 --> 14:20.325
(laser blast)

14:20.327 --> 14:21.526
Whoa!
Sam!

14:21.528 --> 14:22.994
It's about time.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.562
Why aren't you
in your armor?

14:24.564 --> 14:27.365
You know, forget it.
Mom, right?

14:27.367 --> 14:32.237
You've got to think
about your team here, sam.

14:32.239 --> 14:37.342
I'm going to get fired
and grounded.

14:37.344 --> 14:40.979
Unexpected trip
to the microverse, huh?

14:40.981 --> 14:43.014
Yup.

14:43.016 --> 14:45.617
Got to be more fun
than working with ants.

14:45.619 --> 14:47.485
Bug off.

14:47.487 --> 14:51.022
(grunting)

14:51.024 --> 14:53.958
Sam, you're now officially
the smartest guy in the room.

14:53.960 --> 14:58.897
How much smarter do you have
to be to realize this lie
has gone too far?

14:58.899 --> 15:01.966
Get in the game, sam.
(sighs)

15:01.968 --> 15:03.968
Mom, stay with the guys.

15:03.970 --> 15:05.937
I've got to take care
of something.

15:05.939 --> 15:08.006
So...

15:08.008 --> 15:13.544
How you liking
new york so far?

15:13.546 --> 15:19.050
There!

15:19.052 --> 15:20.952
Redwing, to me.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.420
Captain america:
The tide is turning
against us.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.055
We need to fall back
to another room.

15:24.057 --> 15:26.925
Thor: Aye.

15:26.927 --> 15:30.495
Hope this works.

15:30.497 --> 15:32.463
Falcon.

15:32.465 --> 15:37.001
(laughs)
let me be the first
to say, that gun...

15:37.003 --> 15:38.469
Language!
Vacuums really well.

15:38.471 --> 15:41.039
(chuckles nervously)

15:41.041 --> 15:45.043
(yelps)

15:45.045 --> 15:46.678
(laughs)

15:46.680 --> 15:49.447
Do you have something
to say to me?

15:49.449 --> 15:52.183
Samuel?
Wait.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.152
You knew?

15:54.154 --> 15:55.954
I don't know
which is worse.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.488
That you think
your mother's dumb

15:57.490 --> 15:59.023
Or that I'm blind.

15:59.025 --> 16:01.025
I have a blog.

16:01.027 --> 16:03.528
Uh, not to break this up,
but we need to get
the situation contained.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.096
(rumbling)
(whimpers)

16:05.098 --> 16:09.067
What was that?

16:09.069 --> 16:11.035
Sam: Whoa!

16:11.037 --> 16:15.106
Somebody fix me!

16:15.108 --> 16:16.341
We're going to need
a bigger containment gun.

16:22.114 --> 16:24.015
(screams)
(dog barking)

16:24.017 --> 16:24.015
Aah!

16:24.017 --> 16:29.320
I know my strengths,
sam, but physics isn't
my strongest suit.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.357
If we're going to stop this,
it has to be you.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.225
My upgrade isn't
going to be enough.

16:34.227 --> 16:36.461
And the vacuum
containment chamber
in tony's lab

16:36.463 --> 16:39.630
Doesn't have
the capacity for this
many particles either.

16:39.632 --> 16:42.633
We need to get ant-man
back from the microverse
to modify it.

16:42.635 --> 16:47.705
Then do it.

16:47.707 --> 16:50.408
Okay, cap.
Need your shield.

16:50.410 --> 16:53.678
The vibranium apparently
neutralizes the effects
of the pym particles.

16:53.680 --> 16:53.678
And with this copper wire,

16:53.680 --> 16:57.215
I'm essentially turning it
into a particle magnet.

16:57.217 --> 17:02.053
Hawkeye, I need you, cap,
and thor to guard the hold.

17:02.055 --> 17:04.288
Nothing gets in or out.
Particles or otherwise.

17:04.290 --> 17:07.058
Sure thing.
Cold.

17:07.060 --> 17:07.058
There you go.

17:07.060 --> 17:11.329
Should give you more
barrier latitude, cap.
Uh, thanks?

17:11.330 --> 17:12.763
Mom?
Yeah, honey?

17:12.766 --> 17:16.166
Want to see something
really cool?

17:16.169 --> 17:17.769
(laughs)

17:17.771 --> 17:20.771
Now, this is why
I came to visit!

17:20.773 --> 17:23.040
Avenger moms,
assemble.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.042
Please don't
say that, mom.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.545
And can you stop moving?
I brought you to keep you safe

17:27.547 --> 17:34.685
Not to drop you into
nature's building blocks.

17:34.687 --> 17:41.092
There they are!

17:41.094 --> 17:44.195
Oh, hi.
Falcon's mom,
I presume.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.663
You can call me
darlene.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.598
Later.
There's a breach
in the tower.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.500
And we need to lock
these particles down fast.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.235
Well, there's
a good thought finally.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.638
One question.
How do you propose
we get back to...

17:53.640 --> 17:54.839
Oh, I don't know...

17:54.841 --> 17:56.808
Normal size?

17:56.810 --> 17:58.342
With this.

17:58.344 --> 18:00.611
Did you mod my gun?
Yup.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.780
Who wants
to go first?
Him.

18:02.782 --> 18:09.187
Him.

18:09.189 --> 18:15.593
Now, cap!

18:15.595 --> 18:17.128
Good to have you back.

18:17.130 --> 18:20.131
Good to be back.
Quick thinking,
for a liaison.

18:20.133 --> 18:22.400
Look, tony, I'm sorry.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.635
Oh, I'm sure we'll think
of a torturous laundry list

18:24.637 --> 18:26.270
Of duties for you
to make this up to me,

18:26.272 --> 18:28.372
But first...
Let's get the hulk.

18:28.374 --> 18:32.844
Ow! I'm getting
a cramp! (groans)

18:32.846 --> 18:35.847
Do you know what happens
when this gun reaches
critical mass?

18:35.849 --> 18:38.216
Uh, yeah.
The world ends.

18:38.218 --> 18:41.219
Can you modify the vacuum
collection chamber in the lab

18:41.221 --> 18:43.187
Before that
actually happens?

18:43.189 --> 18:45.523
Done. Now, go bring
the hulk down a peg...

18:45.525 --> 18:47.892
Or 40.

18:47.894 --> 18:51.762
(groans)

18:51.764 --> 18:54.866
Hulk, say cheese!

18:54.868 --> 18:57.635
(whirring)

18:57.637 --> 18:58.836
Don't!

18:58.838 --> 19:01.239
Puny fly!

19:01.241 --> 19:11.182
(whirring)

19:11.184 --> 19:13.284
(screams)

19:13.286 --> 19:19.323
(splashes)

19:19.325 --> 19:24.929
Come on.
Just a little more.
Hold on.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.731
(laughs)
that's my boy!

19:26.733 --> 19:32.170
Get it done, sam!

19:32.172 --> 19:33.771
Now!
Hurry!

19:33.773 --> 19:42.246
(grunts)

19:42.248 --> 19:47.785
(rumbling)

19:47.787 --> 19:49.620
(both groan)

19:49.622 --> 19:52.623
I think I'm just going
to lay here for a while.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.659
Want your mom
to tuck you in?

19:54.661 --> 19:58.796
I now see why you
work with ants.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.565
(giggles)

20:00.567 --> 20:02.366
Mom, quit!

20:02.368 --> 20:03.834
You're embarrassing me.

20:03.836 --> 20:06.704
It's the least I can do
for you lying to me.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.973
Yeah. That was
a big mistake.

20:08.975 --> 20:12.376
And if I thought you
hadn't been through
enough pain for that lie,

20:12.378 --> 20:13.911
I would be furious.

20:13.913 --> 20:16.547
But look, sam.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.816
When you started this whole
s.H.I.E.L.D. Adventure,

20:18.818 --> 20:20.885
I had to give fury
my permission.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.920
Permission?
Uh...

20:22.922 --> 20:27.825
Of course.
Sam is only 17.

20:27.827 --> 20:30.394
Ah-ha. And now,
you're sorry.

20:30.396 --> 20:34.699
The point is, fury
told me when you
became an avenger.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.901
And I didn't
make a peep.

20:36.903 --> 20:39.270
Even when you
lied about it.

20:39.272 --> 20:41.872
I thought you'd be worried.
That you'd say no.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.841
Of course, I worry.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.676
It's my job.

20:45.678 --> 20:49.547
But it is also my job
to believe in you.

20:49.549 --> 20:52.416
To help you
follow your dreams.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.585
To let you fly.
Ha!

20:54.587 --> 20:55.987
Because he is a falcon.

20:55.989 --> 20:58.422
Funny!
(groans)
not now.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.725
Man, you really need
to take a comedy
class or something.

21:00.727 --> 21:00.725
Timing?

21:00.727 --> 21:05.663
You're an avenger, sam.
My favorite avenger.

21:05.665 --> 21:06.964
No offense, hulk.

21:06.966 --> 21:10.368
Just keep making
me cookies.
We're good.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.270
I'll never lie
to you again, mom.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.372
I promise.
For real.

21:14.374 --> 21:17.308
I know.
Okay, enough mush.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.976
Are you superheroes
or what?

21:18.978 --> 21:21.479
Now, get in here, guys.
All of you.

21:21.481 --> 21:25.016
I need at least one proper
photo to mark the occasion.

21:25.018 --> 21:28.352
