40:35.659 --> 40:37.267
What do you do for a living?

40:37.418 --> 40:41.345
Well...I just quit my job
to travel across the country

40:41.498 --> 40:43.181
And I'm trying to start a blog.

40:43.333 --> 40:45.516
-Hmm.
-But I have a blog.

40:45.610 --> 40:48.111
So...I'm building my website,
and it's been really stressful,

40:48.262 --> 40:52.765
And...He doesn't even believe
I can do any of it, so...

40:52.859 --> 40:54.600
That's kind of in my head,
and I don't--I don't know.

40:54.619 --> 40:56.527
He's kind of a downer,
and I don't know, this morning,

40:56.621 --> 40:58.121
We were just fighting,

40:58.348 --> 41:00.198
And he wouldn't let me
in the car before.

41:00.292 --> 41:01.774
Why would he let you in the car?
Because of the ocd?

41:01.793 --> 41:04.294
He said I need to calm down,
yeah.

41:04.445 --> 41:08.039
But...I'm, like,
perfectly calm.

41:08.133 --> 41:09.782
I'm calm all the time.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.876
This just really
stresses me out,

41:12.028 --> 41:15.546
And this is a rough morning.

41:17.976 --> 41:20.626
Oh. You, uh, you spoke
to gabrielle, my, uh, fiancée?

41:20.645 --> 41:23.054
Yeah, I spoke to her. Why don't
you tell me what happened?

41:23.206 --> 41:24.872
Um...Well, she just--you know,

41:24.891 --> 41:26.724
She gets worked up sometimes,
and so, like,

41:26.876 --> 41:28.968
I try to--
I try to keep my distance. Um...

41:28.987 --> 41:30.487
That's why I locked the car
and was walking away.

41:30.638 --> 41:33.548
Um, but...So what--
what happened this morning

41:33.641 --> 41:35.399
Was that she was working
on a little, like,

41:35.552 --> 41:37.051

I was giving her time

And everything, and--
and, um...

41:43.651 --> 41:45.393
We really had a--like, a really
nice morning, if anything.

41:45.486 --> 41:46.652
But she just got worked up

41:46.671 --> 41:48.153
Because we were trying
to get going

41:48.248 --> 41:49.897
'cause we had to get
our day started

Gabby, you have some marks
on your face. Did he hit you?

41:58.424 --> 42:00.241
We have witnesses who say
they saw him hit you.

42:00.260 --> 42:06.022
Well, I...Yeah, but...
I mean, to be honest,

42:06.173 --> 42:08.266
I-I hit him first.

[police radio chatter]

42:12.680 --> 42:15.347
So...What do you wanna do?

42:15.367 --> 42:18.034
[sighs] she says
she hit him first, but...

42:18.261 --> 42:20.370
I mean, technically,
she's the primary aggressor,

42:20.521 --> 42:23.373
But...How big a feather you need
to knock this kid over?

42:23.600 --> 42:26.376
I really don't wanna take her
to jail over this.

42:26.527 --> 42:28.452
If she said she had no intention
of giving him any injury,

42:28.547 --> 42:29.712
We don't have to call
a domestic assault.

42:29.939 --> 42:32.698
We could just do
a 24-hour no-contact order.

42:32.792 --> 42:34.108
Yeah, I'm good with that.

42:34.127 --> 42:37.303

Yeah, so they took him
to a hotel and s

42:42.302 --> 42:43.951
Yeah, so they took him
to a hotel and said

Well, you don't know that,
and--and this--

42:55.556 --> 42:59.576
This was just a bad fight.

42:59.727 --> 43:03.821
I'm saying you should get
in your car. Drive away.

I should just abandon him

you're having?

Are you talking about, um,

Or are you talking about us?

46:27.193 --> 46:31.770
I mean...Both, I guess.

46:31.864 --> 46:35.683
Okay, so what you're saying
is basically you thought

46:35.776 --> 46:38.110
That everything would be easier
with me?

Easier with us. Don't you think?

about one thing.

No one has a relationship
where it's all fun and games.

in a relationship?

All right, listen,
an arrest warrant was issued

1:06:57.014 --> 1:06:59.681
For brian laundrie because
it is believed that he used

1:06:59.908 --> 1:07:02.408

Uh, we pretty much just hang out
and chill,

Thank you. Uh...

1:08:00.560 --> 1:08:04.987
On the outside,
he could be very charismatic.

1:08:05.140 --> 1:08:07.231
I mean, there's no doubt
in my mind

1:08:07.250 --> 1:08:09.976
That gabby loves him.

1:08:09.994 --> 1:08:12.903
But you know, just, like,
any couple,

1:08:12.997 --> 1:08:16.591
Like, they had their arguments.

1:08:16.818 --> 1:08:19.076
Reporter: Brian is not talking
to the police.

1:08:19.170 --> 1:08:22.413
What is your message to him?

1:08:22.432 --> 1:08:25.583
If he just gave us
any bit of information,

1:08:25.602 --> 1:08:28.752
Anything that would...

1:08:28.772 --> 1:08:31.922
It would give us a place
to start.

1:08:32.016 --> 1:08:34.609

<i> So now right there, you'll see</i>

<i> Brian's mother is heading to</i>
<i> the shed in their backyard.</i>

1:08:46.514 --> 1:08:48.197
<i> Right here, you can see</i>

1:08:48.350 --> 1:08:49.791
<i> No one's watching.</i>

1:08:49.942 --> 1:08:52.794
<i> And there you can see him.</i>
<i> Brian's in the shed.</i>

1:08:52.945 --> 1:08:55.613
<i> It's clear they're keeping him</i>
<i> back there.</i>

1:08:55.707 --> 1:08:57.615
<i> I don't know why the hell</i>
<i> the cops</i>

1:08:57.709 --> 1:08:59.634
<i> Aren't taking this seriously.</i>

<i> I think she's still alive</i>
<i> and out there someplace.</i>

1:09:05.976 --> 1:09:08.626
<i> I think they just got</i>
<i> into another big-ass fight.</i>

1:09:08.720 --> 1:09:10.386
<i> I mean, this guy's a hothead,</i>

1:09:10.538 --> 1:09:12.555
<i> But he doesn't look like</i>
<i> he could kill her to me.</i>

1:09:12.649 --> 1:09:15.391
<i> Now you can always tell</i>
<i> a killer by his eyes. Always.</i>

1:09:15.543 --> 1:09:16.967
<i> Brian's got eyes more like</i>
<i> you'd see</i>

1:09:17.061 --> 1:09:18.711
<i> In a wall street bad guy.</i>

1:09:18.804 --> 1:09:21.047
<i> I can see him driving away,</i>
<i> leaving her stuck by herself.</i>

1:09:21.065 --> 1:09:24.993
<i> But nah,</i>
<i> he'd never actually kill her.</i>

1:09:25.220 --> 1:09:28.746
[sighs]

1:09:30.558 --> 1:09:32.225
<i> Woman: On August 29th,</i>

1:09:32.318 --> 1:09:35.061
<i> My boyfriend and I actually</i>
<i> picked up brian</i>

1:09:35.079 --> 1:09:38.656
<i> At grand teton national park</i>
<i> sometime that night.</i>

1:09:38.750 --> 1:09:40.917
<i> Uh...When I saw him on tiktok,</i>

1:09:41.069 --> 1:09:43.403
<i> I recognized him</i>
<i> as the same guy.</i>

1:09:43.421 --> 1:09:46.163
<i> Anyway, he said that he needed</i>
<i> to go to jackson,</i>

1:09:46.183 --> 1:09:49.684
<i> And we said, "hop in"</i>
<i> because we were going there.</i>

1:09:49.911 --> 1:09:52.353
<i>We made small talk, and he said</i>
<i> that he had been camping</i>

1:09:52.580 --> 1:09:55.857
<i> For multiple days</i>
<i> without his fiancée.</i>

1:09:56.084 --> 1:09:58.084
<i> He did mention his fiancée</i>
<i> and said that</i>

1:09:58.102 --> 1:09:59.752
<i> She was back at their van</i>

1:09:59.771 --> 1:10:02.846
<i> Working on</i>
<i> their social media page.</i>

1:10:02.866 --> 1:10:05.758
<i> Um, and then all of a sudden,</i>
<i> he just freaks out.</i>

1:10:05.851 --> 1:10:08.185
<i> He's like, "I've gotta get out</i>
<i> right now!"</i>

1:10:08.205 --> 1:10:10.947
<i> [scoffs] so we pulled over</i>
<i> at the jackson dam,</i>

1:10:11.099 --> 1:10:14.525
<i> And he kinda, like,</i>
<i> hurried out of the car.</i>

1:10:14.619 --> 1:10:16.452
<i> Um...He had some scruff,</i>

1:10:16.546 --> 1:10:19.714
<i> But for someone who had been</i>
<i> camping for several days,</i>

1:10:19.941 --> 1:10:22.866
<i> He didn't look dirty.</i>
<i> He didn't smell dirty.</i>

1:10:22.961 --> 1:10:25.053
<i> And that part was kinda weird.</i>

1:10:26.297 --> 1:10:28.464
Weeding out all the nutjobs,
we've got

1:10:28.558 --> 1:10:30.616
Several eyewitness accounts
that are clicking together

1:10:30.635 --> 1:10:33.544
To give us maybe
a useful narrative.

1:10:33.638 --> 1:10:34.896
Let's talk about the couple
that said

1:10:35.123 --> 1:10:37.548
They picked up brian laundrie
hitchhiking.

1:10:37.642 --> 1:10:40.960
And let's assume for the moment
he did kill this poor girl.

1:10:41.053 --> 1:10:44.130
<i> He has just killed</i>
<i> his fiancée.</i>

1:10:44.148 --> 1:10:47.057
<i> He's panicking.</i>

1:10:47.077 --> 1:10:48.317
<i> He decides to just leave</i>
<i> everything behind,</i>

1:10:48.470 --> 1:10:51.246
<i> Get the hell out of there.</i>

1:10:51.473 --> 1:10:54.732
[panting]

1:10:54.751 --> 1:10:56.158
[whispers] okay.

1:10:56.253 --> 1:10:57.660
[exhales deeply]

1:10:57.754 --> 1:11:01.739
He's picked up by miranda baker
and her boyfriend.

1:11:01.833 --> 1:11:03.258
He makes up an alibi

1:11:03.409 --> 1:11:06.076
<i> About camping by himself</i>
<i> while gabby</i>

1:11:06.170 --> 1:11:08.488
<i> Is back at the van alone.</i>

1:11:08.581 --> 1:11:10.748
<i>Maybe his story's gonna be some</i>
<i>stranger found her out there,</i>

1:11:10.842 --> 1:11:12.767
<i> Killed her while he was away.</i>

1:11:12.994 --> 1:11:14.251
<i> Who knows?</i>

1:11:14.271 --> 1:11:16.662
But at some point on his way
out of dodge,

1:11:16.756 --> 1:11:19.015
He realizes this is a bad plan

1:11:19.167 --> 1:11:22.110
Because he has left
all the evidence behind.

1:11:22.261 --> 1:11:26.005
As she tells it, he freaks
and decides to bail.

1:11:26.024 --> 1:11:28.841
Six minutes later,
he gets another ride,

1:11:28.860 --> 1:11:31.452
<i> This time taking him back</i>
<i>to the campground he came from.</i>

1:11:31.679 --> 1:11:33.437
<i> But here's the thing.</i>
<i> Not all the way.</i>

1:11:33.531 --> 1:11:35.348
<i> The driver said he was willing</i>

1:11:35.441 --> 1:11:36.699
<i> To take him further</i>
<i> into the camp,</i>

1:11:36.851 --> 1:11:39.276
<i> Which is</i>
<i> a huge, spread-out site.</i>

1:11:39.370 --> 1:11:42.797
<i> But he says he'd rather walk.</i>

1:11:42.948 --> 1:11:44.632
I mean, wouldn't want them

1:11:44.859 --> 1:11:46.876
To drive him right
to the murder scene, would he?

1:11:47.028 --> 1:11:51.288
<i> He buries her.</i>
<i>He cleans the site best he can.</i>

1:11:51.382 --> 1:11:54.625
<i> He packs up everything that</i>
<i> will show he was ever there,</i>

1:11:54.719 --> 1:11:57.461
<i> And he drives off.</i>
-[engine starts]

1:11:57.555 --> 1:12:00.039
<i>Two days later, he arrives back</i>
<i>in florida all by his lonesome.</i>

1:12:00.058 --> 1:12:03.059
So if these witnesses
are credible,

1:12:03.211 --> 1:12:04.468
And I believe they are,

1:12:04.562 --> 1:12:07.229
If laundrie did, in fact,
kill gabby,

1:12:07.324 --> 1:12:11.492
She'd be somewhere out here
in these 5 or 6 square miles.

1:12:18.409 --> 1:12:20.560
See anything?
Nope.

But so far,
the search for gabby petito

1:12:32.590 --> 1:12:36.351

Right. His mother just happened
to know where her son

That I have in my gut that
there was something else

I could have done.

was rocky,

And I just let her go.

1:17:07.682 --> 1:17:09.014
[clears throat]
do you--do you think

1:17:09.108 --> 1:17:11.292
She would've let you stop her?

1:17:11.519 --> 1:17:14.629
[laughs] no.

1:17:14.856 --> 1:17:15.855
[crying]

1:17:15.873 --> 1:17:18.115
Yeah, so...

1:17:18.209 --> 1:17:20.042
What could you have done?

1:17:20.194 --> 1:17:23.028
Look...

1:17:23.047 --> 1:17:25.931
Gabby--she, uh... [chuckles]

1:17:27.535 --> 1:17:32.480
She lived her life
exactly how she wanted to.

1:17:32.631 --> 1:17:37.042
You know, that's part of what we
all loved about her.

1:17:37.061 --> 1:17:42.490
Some of these, uh...Thoughts
that you've been having,

1:17:42.641 --> 1:17:43.732
They've, uh...

1:17:43.885 --> 1:17:46.327
They've been torturing me, too.

1:17:46.478 --> 1:17:48.721
But we can't let them.

1:17:48.814 --> 1:17:50.998
You know, we're--
we're gonna be...

1:17:51.225 --> 1:17:53.242
[crying]

1:17:53.336 --> 1:17:56.578
We're gonna be missing her
for the rest of our lives,

1:17:56.731 --> 1:18:03.511
So...We have to figure out,
uh, a way to live with that.

1:18:03.738 --> 1:18:05.905
How?

1:18:05.923 --> 1:18:09.074
[sniffles]

1:18:09.093 --> 1:18:12.853
Um...Just...

1:18:15.340 --> 1:18:17.674

1:18:17.768 --> 1:18:21.103

It's going to be rough.

a lot of us, rose.

1:18:27.019 --> 1:18:31.113
And we're gonna get through it
together.

1:18:31.265 --> 1:18:33.040
I just have a lot of this anger

1:18:33.192 --> 1:18:34.450
That I don't know what
to do with,

1:18:34.602 --> 1:18:38.287
And that son of a bitch
is still out there.

1:18:38.381 --> 1:18:42.049

1:18:54.379 --> 1:18:57.047
And showing your respects
for gabby.

1:18:57.141 --> 1:18:59.382
But I don't want you to be sad.

1:18:59.402 --> 1:19:02.052
Gabby didn't live her life
that way.

1:19:02.146 --> 1:19:04.129
She always made people
feel welcomed.

1:19:04.148 --> 1:19:09.076
She...She treated people
with respect.

1:19:09.228 --> 1:19:10.652
She cared.

1:19:10.805 --> 1:19:13.822
She genuinely cared.

1:19:13.916 --> 1:19:15.374
[crying in background]

1:19:20.481 --> 1:19:26.819
My daughter lived a short life,
but she lived an inspiring one.

1:19:26.912 --> 1:19:30.155
I want you to look
at the pictures

1:19:30.174 --> 1:19:32.324
Around this room and...

1:19:32.417 --> 1:19:36.771
I want you to be inspired
by them.

1:19:41.185 --> 1:19:42.684
We've gotten emails
from around the country

1:19:42.779 --> 1:19:44.928
From people that gabby touched--

1:19:44.947 --> 1:19:46.855
People who wanna live
their lives bigger,

1:19:46.949 --> 1:19:48.282
People who wanna... [chuckles]

1:19:50.936 --> 1:19:52.912
They wanna get rid of the things
that are holding 'em back.

1:20:01.780 --> 1:20:05.115
And that's
the most important thing.

1:20:05.134 --> 1:20:09.545
If you're in a...Relationship...

1:20:09.697 --> 1:20:13.456
That might not be the best thing
for you, leave it.

1:20:13.476 --> 1:20:16.459
Leave it now.

wouldn't you?

1:20:59.355 --> 1:21:01.522
You'd let me do it
if you were here.

1:21:04.026 --> 1:21:05.675

That's the question, isn't it?
[chuckles]

1:21:20.543 --> 1:21:23.360
What finally made brian snap?

1:21:23.379 --> 1:21:25.604
I'm gonna get back on my meds.

1:21:25.623 --> 1:21:28.215
I'm gonna make something
of myself for you

1:21:28.442 --> 1:21:31.034
Because I wanna build
a future together.

1:21:31.053 --> 1:21:32.553
So things are gonna change,
okay?

1:21:32.780 --> 1:21:37.707
And I just need you to give me
the chance to prove that.

1:21:37.727 --> 1:21:40.394
Brian...

1:21:44.291 --> 1:21:46.025
I love you.

1:21:47.570 --> 1:21:49.386
I do.

1:21:49.405 --> 1:21:51.146
I always will.

-No, gabby, no, no, no.
-Listen to me.

1:21:57.729 --> 1:21:59.396
-That's--
-listen.

1:21:59.415 --> 1:22:03.475
You're not a bad person.
I'm not a bad person.

1:22:03.494 --> 1:22:06.587
It's just this trip has shown me
what it would be like

1:22:06.738 --> 1:22:10.758
If we stayed together,
and all we do is fight.

1:22:10.909 --> 1:22:11.817
That's not true. We don't--
that's not all we do. We--

1:22:11.910 --> 1:22:14.820
Brian, we fight every day.

1:22:14.838 --> 1:22:17.765
And I don't want my life
to be like that.

1:22:17.992 --> 1:22:20.267
And I don't--I don't know what
I want it to be, exactly,

1:22:20.419 --> 1:22:22.919
But not--not that.

1:22:22.939 --> 1:22:25.998
And I...

1:22:26.016 --> 1:22:27.775
Ooh. I...

1:22:28.002 --> 1:22:29.334
[sighs]

1:22:29.428 --> 1:22:31.687
I need to be with someone
whose life

1:22:31.839 --> 1:22:35.190
Is more than just about me.

1:22:35.284 --> 1:22:36.508
You suggested this whole trip.

1:22:36.601 --> 1:22:38.510
I...I thought you wanted
to travel

1:22:38.603 --> 1:22:42.181
And see the world together,
but...

1:22:42.199 --> 1:22:44.625
It feels like you just want me
all to yourself.

1:22:44.852 --> 1:22:45.960
You know, most girls--they--
they would--

1:22:46.111 --> 1:22:48.203
They would love that kind
of attention.

1:22:48.355 --> 1:22:49.612
Well, not this one.

1:22:57.289 --> 1:22:59.473
It's not your fault, okay?

1:22:59.624 --> 1:23:02.534
It's not. You don't have to want
the same things that I do.

1:23:02.553 --> 1:23:05.962
You know? I think a lot
of the time I was projecting

1:23:05.982 --> 1:23:08.816
What--what I wanted on to you,
and that was selfish.

1:23:08.967 --> 1:23:10.559
And I'm--I'm sorry.
That was my fault.

1:23:10.653 --> 1:23:12.969
I'm--I'm really sorry.

1:23:12.989 --> 1:23:15.972

to think about this, please.

1:23:15.992 --> 1:23:18.717
Brian, brian.

1:23:18.810 --> 1:23:23.572
This is all I have been
thinking about for weeks.

1:23:23.666 --> 1:23:25.482
It isn't fair for either of us
to hold on to something

1:23:25.576 --> 1:23:28.577
That we know isn't working.

1:23:28.671 --> 1:23:30.229
Brian.

1:23:30.322 --> 1:23:32.914
You have to know
it isn't working.

1:23:33.009 --> 1:23:36.902
I think we should take the van
back to florida,

1:23:36.920 --> 1:23:41.849
And I can get on a bus
back home to new york.

1:23:44.353 --> 1:23:46.836
Brian?

1:23:46.856 --> 1:23:50.649

it's not your fault, okay?

It's not. It's not your fault.

1:24:00.444 --> 1:24:02.703
It's not your fault, okay?
It's okay.
