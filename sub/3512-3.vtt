00:18.851 --> 00:20.336
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, pal,

00:20.337 --> 00:21.353
you can't cut through here.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.269
It's private property.
Sorry about that.

00:26.530 --> 00:27.709
Oh, my God.

00:35.838 --> 00:37.062
Oh, Castle,

00:37.133 --> 00:39.572
I wish we could stay like this all morning.

00:39.573 --> 00:40.523
Yeah.

00:40.662 --> 00:42.639
Among other positions.

00:42.806 --> 00:44.798
Do you know what my favorite position is?

00:45.854 --> 00:47.193
In person.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.756
Yeah, mine, too.

00:51.757 --> 00:53.334
You know what? Maybe I
can fly up this weekend

00:53.335 --> 00:56.693
if there's no new cases.
I would so make it worth your while.

00:57.754 --> 01:00.536
Oh, no. It's the office.

01:00.537 --> 01:01.584
I have to call in.

01:01.585 --> 01:03.406
And there goes our weekend tryst.

01:03.407 --> 01:05.578
No, maybe not. Maybe it's not a case.

01:05.579 --> 01:07.308
Oh, it's always a case.

01:07.387 --> 01:09.172
Hey, maybe, uh, don't you want to take

01:09.173 --> 01:10.457
a quick shower before work?

01:10.458 --> 01:12.209
Maybe you could take the phone in with you.

01:12.210 --> 01:14.352
It is waterproof.

01:15.269 --> 01:16.202
Maybe later.

01:16.203 --> 01:17.372
I'll hold you to that.

01:17.470 --> 01:18.312
Okay.

01:30.954 --> 01:32.104
Pi.

01:36.505 --> 01:37.612
Morning, dad!

01:37.748 --> 01:39.486
I hope Pi and I didn't wake you.

01:39.487 --> 01:40.504
We're making smoothies.

01:40.505 --> 01:42.858
And yet for me, not so smooth.

01:42.859 --> 01:44.006
I'll whip one up for you.

01:44.007 --> 01:46.227
Good morning, all!
Good morning.

01:46.228 --> 01:49.045
Ah! Pi, I'll have my usual.

01:49.295 --> 01:50.608
Anti-aging.

01:50.609 --> 01:52.780
You got it, Mrs. R.
Thank you.

01:59.970 --> 02:02.665
Darling, couldn't you just pretend

02:02.666 --> 02:04.668
to appreciate Pi's efforts?

02:04.669 --> 02:06.650
What efforts? Half the time, I don't know

02:06.651 --> 02:08.059
if I'm smelling our new compost bin

02:08.060 --> 02:09.663
or my daughter's rotting ambition.

02:09.663 --> 02:13.172
Oh, Richard, she's 19 years old,
and that boy is just--look.

02:13.173 --> 02:15.050
It's good. She'll get it out of her system.

02:15.051 --> 02:17.517
I just wish she would get it
out of her system faster,

02:17.518 --> 02:19.207
and out of my house.

02:19.652 --> 02:21.571
Maybe I should just put my foot down,

02:21.608 --> 02:23.273
show her my stern disapproval.

02:23.274 --> 02:25.814
Please. Alexis will just rebel,

02:25.815 --> 02:27.622
and she'll want to be with him even more.

02:27.623 --> 02:29.667
So then I should approve?
No, no, no.

02:29.668 --> 02:31.525
That'll just cement the relationship.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.678
She'll be sleeping on the couch with him.

02:34.181 --> 02:35.677
So what am I supposed to do?

02:36.024 --> 02:37.557
Drink your kale blast.

02:38.027 --> 02:40.152
And just ride it out, kiddo.

02:41.742 --> 02:42.350
At the reconstruction site...

02:42.351 --> 02:43.682
Is that Charlie Reynolds?

02:43.751 --> 02:46.102
Turn that up.
...Police are currently investigating.

02:46.115 --> 02:47.182
Reynolds was an actor,

02:47.183 --> 02:49.447
best known as the star
of the '90s TV comedy

02:49.448 --> 02:50.840
"2 Cool For School,"

02:50.841 --> 02:53.300
where he played lovable nerd Dewey Hancock.
Oh...

02:54.094 --> 02:55.537
How awful.

02:55.746 --> 02:57.934
I did a guest spot on that show.

02:57.935 --> 02:59.290
That was a simpler time,

02:59.291 --> 03:01.110
when Dewey's catchphrase, "Hubba, hubba,"

03:01.111 --> 03:02.530
passed as sparkling dialogue.

03:02.531 --> 03:04.243
In a bizarre twist, the body was found

03:04.244 --> 03:06.391
hanging from the hook of
a construction crane.

03:06.392 --> 03:07.591
Oh, gruesome.

03:07.592 --> 03:10.871
Yes. If by "gruesome," you mean awesome.

03:10.872 --> 03:13.696
Look. That's Esposito and Ryan.

03:13.893 --> 03:16.323
This is exactly what I need.

03:16.513 --> 03:20.585
Former child star literally
getting the hook.

03:21.220 --> 03:23.093
Hoisted on his own petard.

03:23.598 --> 03:24.606
Hung out to dry.

03:24.607 --> 03:25.797
Okay, I get it.

03:29.584 --> 03:30.704
Did you see that?

03:31.843 --> 03:33.302
He just declined my call.

03:34.049 --> 03:37.148
Looks like Charlie isn't the
only one hung out to dry.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.183
Okay.

03:47.707 --> 03:48.676
Hey, I was--

03:54.846 --> 03:55.878
Uh, sorry.

03:55.879 --> 03:57.540
Only N.Y.P.D. past this point.

03:57.541 --> 03:58.774
You must be new here. I'm actually--

03:58.775 --> 04:00.527
I know exactly who you are.

04:00.545 --> 04:03.408
Like I said, only N.Y.P.D. past this point.

04:03.409 --> 04:04.646
That's--th-there-- right there.

04:04.647 --> 04:06.212
Those are my people right here. Hey, guys--

04:06.213 --> 04:08.698
It's okay, Sully. We got it.
All right.

04:08.699 --> 04:10.279
Thanks.
Hey, Castle.

04:10.777 --> 04:11.714
Who's that guy, right?

04:11.715 --> 04:13.733
Uh, that is Detective Grant Sullivan.

04:13.860 --> 04:14.954
As much as we miss Beckett,

04:14.955 --> 04:17.487
it's nice to have a new guy to boss around.
Thanks.

04:18.752 --> 04:19.856
What you doing here, bro?
Well,

04:19.857 --> 04:22.516
you would know if you would
have answered my call.

04:22.710 --> 04:23.858
I must not have heard it ring.

04:23.859 --> 04:26.708
You rejected it. On live television.

04:26.978 --> 04:29.815
Look, guys, look, I am big
enough to overlook that

04:29.816 --> 04:31.726
and still offer to help you guys out.

04:31.727 --> 04:34.078
Help us out?
This is a high-profile case,

04:34.079 --> 04:37.279
and I am willing to let you
guys exclusively benefit

04:37.280 --> 04:40.368
from my out-of-the-box crime-solving mind.

04:40.820 --> 04:42.034
And what do you get?

04:42.110 --> 04:44.269
Escape from the life at the loft.

04:44.270 --> 04:46.569
Ah. Sorry, Castle. If
Gates were to find out...

04:46.570 --> 04:47.805
Yeah.
She won't! She won't find out.

04:47.806 --> 04:49.224
I happen to know she's...

04:49.756 --> 04:51.897
she's at a conference in Florida, so...

04:52.327 --> 04:53.781
you won't even know I'm here.

04:57.168 --> 04:59.710
A washed-up sitcom star
dangling from a hook?

04:59.711 --> 05:00.806
Does it get any better?

05:00.807 --> 05:02.260
I grew up watching that show.

05:02.276 --> 05:04.801
Charlie Reynolds is highly
underrated as an actor.

05:04.802 --> 05:06.875
"2 Cool For School" is a timeless gem.

05:06.876 --> 05:10.835
I seriously doubt that. Not
that I've ever watched it.

05:10.875 --> 05:13.013
Mr. Castle, you're back.

05:13.014 --> 05:14.956
But not by popular demand.

05:14.957 --> 05:16.803
Good to see you, too, Perlmutter.

05:16.819 --> 05:18.065
Do you have a time of death for us?

05:18.066 --> 05:20.154
Uh, between 7:00 P.M. and 2:00 A.M.

05:20.155 --> 05:22.983
The cause is obvious. He
plummeted off the roof

05:22.984 --> 05:24.993
and landed on the hook.

05:24.994 --> 05:26.316
Possible suicide?

05:26.317 --> 05:29.331
Based on the crane's
distance from the building

05:29.332 --> 05:31.549
and signs of struggle on the roof...

05:32.447 --> 05:33.708
he was pushed.

05:35.386 --> 05:37.293
What was Charlie Reynolds doing
on the roof in the first place?

05:37.294 --> 05:38.394
That's a good question. He actually owns

05:38.395 --> 05:40.865
an apartment in the building,
but he wasn't living here.

05:40.866 --> 05:42.449
Every unit's been stripped
down to the studs,

05:42.450 --> 05:43.877
so he was staying in a sublet.

05:43.878 --> 05:45.068
Any family or next of kin?

05:45.069 --> 05:48.319
On the TV show, yes. In
real life, not so much.

05:48.362 --> 05:49.779
Well, whatever he was doing here,

05:49.780 --> 05:51.918
I've got unis canvassing
to see if anyone saw

05:51.919 --> 05:54.104
him or anyone else last night in the area.

05:57.213 --> 05:58.405
I wonder what this means.

05:59.700 --> 06:00.791
Nine digits.

06:00.792 --> 06:03.139
Well, given he was pushed off
a roof and landed on a hook,

06:03.140 --> 06:05.396
I'm saying that is not his lucky number.

06:05.741 --> 06:06.685
Yo, Sully.

06:06.686 --> 06:07.751
Yeah?

06:09.121 --> 06:10.619
Check out this number
and see how it connects

06:10.620 --> 06:12.856
with our victim, and let's
start piecing together

06:12.857 --> 06:14.431
where he was before he wound up here.

06:14.432 --> 06:16.636
I'm on it. In the meantime,
I checked his voicemail,

06:16.637 --> 06:18.339
and he had a bunch of
angry messages yesterday

06:18.340 --> 06:19.511
from some chick.

06:19.512 --> 06:22.417
Said she would kill him if
he didn't call her back.

06:22.418 --> 06:24.338
Said she would not be ignored.

06:24.339 --> 06:27.369
Aha. A classic rabbit boiler.

06:27.370 --> 06:30.347
Stalker, gentlemen. An obsessed fan.

06:30.509 --> 06:31.796
Do we know who the caller is?

06:31.797 --> 06:34.218
Uh, I traced the number
to an address downtown.

06:34.219 --> 06:36.408
Uh, name is, uh...
Geraldine Powers.

06:36.409 --> 06:38.325
Ger-Geraldine Powers. Yeah.

06:38.326 --> 06:41.160
I bet she even has a creepy shrine to him.

06:42.843 --> 06:45.515
I did not kill Charlie Reynolds!

06:45.516 --> 06:48.528
But you did threaten to kill him.
Repeatedly.

06:48.569 --> 06:52.508
And you do seem to have more
than a casual interest in him.

06:52.590 --> 06:54.248
Well, of course I do.

06:54.249 --> 06:55.896
I'm the one who kept his show on the air

06:55.897 --> 06:57.547
for six seasons.

06:57.841 --> 06:59.486
Are you taking any medication?

06:59.487 --> 07:01.711
I am not delusional.

07:01.712 --> 07:04.387
I am Charlie's agent, nitwit.

07:04.927 --> 07:06.081
His agent?

07:06.689 --> 07:07.740
Yeah.

07:08.073 --> 07:12.155
I've been running the shows
nonstop since I got the news.

07:13.410 --> 07:15.837
I signed Charlie back in '92

07:15.838 --> 07:18.681
when he was on "2 Cool For School."

07:18.797 --> 07:19.886
What do I do?

07:19.887 --> 07:23.152
Play it cool. Chicks dig mystery.

07:23.153 --> 07:24.749
Mystery...
Oh, here she comes.

07:24.750 --> 07:27.975
After the show was canceled,
the phones stopped ringing.

07:27.977 --> 07:30.972
Most agents would have
dumped his ass, but me?

07:31.175 --> 07:32.720
I stuck with him.

07:33.754 --> 07:37.126
Oh, this is the scene! This
is where history was made.

07:37.127 --> 07:38.254
Hey, Lisa...

07:42.615 --> 07:44.161
Hubba, hubba!

07:48.523 --> 07:50.321
A timeless gem? Really?

07:50.322 --> 07:54.526
Eh... that was a very...
nuanced performance.

07:55.451 --> 07:56.946
Nothing you're telling me is explaining

07:56.947 --> 07:58.953
why you threatened Charlie Reynolds.

07:58.954 --> 08:00.814
Charlie moved into a sublet

08:00.815 --> 08:02.818
while his building was being rehabbed.

08:02.819 --> 08:05.115
And a few days ago, some of his mail

08:05.116 --> 08:07.339
got forwarded here by mistake.

08:07.340 --> 08:10.274
His bank statement showed that
he had just made a deposit

08:10.275 --> 08:13.548
for 125 grand.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.611
Charlie could barely cover his rent

08:15.612 --> 08:16.980
with the jobs I booked.

08:16.981 --> 08:19.760
So... where'd he get the cash?

08:20.939 --> 08:22.773
Only thing that makes sense
is that he booked a gig

08:22.774 --> 08:25.880
on the side and cut me
out of my commission.

08:25.881 --> 08:27.677
Do you have any idea what that gig was?

08:27.678 --> 08:32.010
No, but... for him to pull
in that kind of money...

08:32.721 --> 08:35.037
it had to be something big.

08:35.038 --> 08:36.820
The key here is that mystery gig.

08:36.821 --> 08:39.200
A down-on-his-luck actor
barely scraping by?

08:39.201 --> 08:41.004
Maybe he got involved in some shady deal

08:41.005 --> 08:42.032
that cost him his life.

08:42.033 --> 08:44.468
Or someone recognized
his true acting talent

08:44.469 --> 08:45.389
and gave him a job.

08:45.390 --> 08:47.543
Like some C-list "Where Are
They Now?" reality show

08:47.544 --> 08:50.529
where he has to mud-wrestle
Danny Bonaduce and Webster

08:50.530 --> 08:52.230
just to get a job with Donald Trump.

08:52.231 --> 08:54.531
Wh-what happened to Beckett's desk?

08:54.806 --> 08:56.230
That's Sully's desk now.

08:56.843 --> 08:58.598
Oh, uh, Mr. Castle,

08:58.599 --> 09:01.246
sorry if I came on a little
strong back at the scene.

09:01.247 --> 09:03.108
I'm still trying to get
the lay of the land here.

09:03.109 --> 09:06.117
Detective Beckett left
some big shoes to fill.

09:06.118 --> 09:08.271
Yeah, she did. I see you filled her desk.

09:08.272 --> 09:10.867
Mr. Castle, what are you doing here?

09:10.868 --> 09:12.749
Captain Gates, I'm--I-I--

09:13.392 --> 09:15.816
I-I thought you were at a conference.

09:15.817 --> 09:17.303
It ended a day early.

09:17.304 --> 09:18.656
But you wouldn't even know that

09:18.657 --> 09:20.524
unless you were checking up on me.

09:21.236 --> 09:23.294
Oh. I see what's happened here.

09:23.295 --> 09:25.584
This man has insinuated himself

09:25.585 --> 09:28.500
into the Charlie Reynolds
investigation, hasn't he?

09:28.501 --> 09:29.705
And you let him.

09:30.159 --> 09:32.122
Well, news for you, Mr. Castle.

09:32.123 --> 09:34.201
You are not N.Y.P.D.

09:34.202 --> 09:36.509
and you no longer have a
reason for being here.

09:36.510 --> 09:38.127
This is our murder case.

09:38.128 --> 09:39.276
Not anymore.

09:41.389 --> 09:43.455
Beckett.
This is our case now.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.046
I have a letter from the Attorney General

09:59.047 --> 10:01.217
authorizing our taking point on this case.

10:01.218 --> 10:02.715
May I see that, please?

10:03.162 --> 10:05.054
Wh-- what are you doing here?

10:05.055 --> 10:06.565
Me? What am I doing--what
are you doing here?

10:06.566 --> 10:07.940
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming to town?

10:07.941 --> 10:09.024
I was gonna surprise you.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.346
Well done.

10:11.151 --> 10:14.358
Then perhaps you should brief the team.

10:14.417 --> 10:16.554
Good morning. I am Agent McCord.

10:16.555 --> 10:18.692
Of course you know Agent Beckett.

10:18.922 --> 10:21.388
We are joining this investigation,

10:21.389 --> 10:24.086
so we need access to all information

10:24.087 --> 10:25.770
regarding Charlie Reynolds' death.

10:25.771 --> 10:27.968
Which is fed speak for
you're pushing us out.

10:27.969 --> 10:29.381
No, you'll continue to work the case.

10:29.382 --> 10:30.912
You'll just be reporting to us.

10:30.913 --> 10:33.079
Uh, why is the murder of an ex-sitcom star

10:33.080 --> 10:34.285
a federal case?

10:37.359 --> 10:38.976
We're not at liberty to say.

10:38.977 --> 10:40.904
No--wait, let me get this straight.

10:40.905 --> 10:42.849
You want us to continue investigating,

10:42.850 --> 10:44.854
report everything to you,

10:44.855 --> 10:47.217
but you're not going to
tell us why you're here?

10:47.218 --> 10:48.385
It's need-to-know.

10:48.876 --> 10:50.314
We'll be setting up in the conference room.

10:50.315 --> 10:51.951
We'll need any preliminary reports

10:51.952 --> 10:54.666
and all of Reynolds' personal electronics--

10:54.667 --> 10:57.098
phones, iPads, computers.

10:57.947 --> 10:59.619
Thank you for your cooperation.

11:02.173 --> 11:03.804
We'll use the victim's
phone and computer data

11:03.805 --> 11:05.739
to reconstruct what he was up to

11:05.740 --> 11:07.424
in his last 24 hours.

11:07.425 --> 11:08.841
And by the way, D.C. made it clear

11:08.842 --> 11:11.309
that they want us to send it to them.

11:11.310 --> 11:12.533
Why do they want the data?

11:12.534 --> 11:15.174
They didn't say. They rarely do.

11:18.004 --> 11:19.417
That's got to bother you.

11:19.418 --> 11:21.000
We don't always get the whole picture.

11:21.153 --> 11:22.753
Comes with the territory.

11:31.273 --> 11:32.808
Maybe we should go over there and just

11:32.809 --> 11:34.931
invite 'em in for some coffee, you know?

11:34.932 --> 11:37.079
We are not serving them coffee.

11:37.080 --> 11:39.694
You bought this espresso
machine for the N.Y.P.D.

11:39.695 --> 11:43.586
This is N.Y.P.D. coffee only.
Come on, guys.

11:44.081 --> 11:45.864
That's a little harsh.
Harsh?

11:46.220 --> 11:47.214
Beckett's a Judas.

11:47.215 --> 11:49.304
Her and her partner just hijacked our case.

11:49.957 --> 11:51.228
Whose side are you on?

11:51.587 --> 11:54.627
Your side. Guys, I'm... I'm on your side.

11:54.628 --> 11:57.304
Hey, Ryan, isn't it a little weird

11:57.305 --> 11:59.578
that Castle shows up the same day

11:59.873 --> 12:01.746
that Agent Beckett takes over?

12:01.747 --> 12:04.286
Yes. It's quite a coincidence.

12:04.419 --> 12:07.323
No. It's not. It's not a coincide--that--

12:07.764 --> 12:10.901
yeah, well... no, actually,
yes, it's a coincidence.

12:11.195 --> 12:14.063
Maybe you and Beckett are
in on this together.

12:14.064 --> 12:15.081
Maybe... what?

12:15.082 --> 12:16.711
You are her inside man.

12:16.712 --> 12:19.462
You... are Judas' Judas.

12:19.526 --> 12:21.631
No--guys--no, I swe--

12:21.645 --> 12:24.105
I swear. Come on. You know me.

12:24.347 --> 12:25.929
I'm watching you, Castle.

12:27.363 --> 12:28.938
Perlmutter's got something for us.

12:30.347 --> 12:31.627
Let's go.
Yeah.

12:34.465 --> 12:37.142
After a complete examination,
I was able to narrow

12:37.143 --> 12:41.027
time of death to between 11:30 and 1:30.

12:41.218 --> 12:44.443
And... perimortem bruising
on the arm and shoulder

12:44.444 --> 12:46.546
is consistent with signs of a struggle.

12:46.547 --> 12:49.572
So Charlie fought back before
he was thrown off the roof?

12:49.573 --> 12:51.070
Yes. But...

12:52.040 --> 12:56.724
the most fascinating
discovery resides in here.

12:56.725 --> 12:57.654
Which is?

12:57.655 --> 12:59.311
An unusually large quantity

12:59.312 --> 13:02.102
of fresh bird excrement that I extracted

13:02.103 --> 13:04.753
from the tread of the victim's shoes.

13:04.772 --> 13:06.836
Uh, no... I'll take your word for it.

13:06.912 --> 13:09.098
Okay, so he stepped in some pigeon--

13:09.099 --> 13:11.586
Sure. Only it didn't come from pigeons.

13:11.746 --> 13:13.431
A painstaking analysis proves

13:13.432 --> 13:16.221
that this is none other than chicken poop.

13:17.352 --> 13:19.148
Not a lot of that in Manhattan.

13:19.149 --> 13:21.928
Maybe Charlie's mystery job had
something to do with chickens?

13:21.929 --> 13:26.381
Well, after "2 Cool For School,"
almost anything is a step up.

13:26.382 --> 13:28.742
Hey, now-- what else you got for us?

13:28.743 --> 13:30.016
I'm afraid that's all I'm authorized

13:30.017 --> 13:31.481
to tell you at this time.

13:34.616 --> 13:35.685
I can't believe it.

13:35.701 --> 13:37.753
Even Perlmutter's answering
to the feds now.

13:37.754 --> 13:39.256
We're being iced out of our own case.

13:39.257 --> 13:41.283
Guys, maybe there's a perfectly
reasonable explanation

13:41.284 --> 13:42.606
for all this secrecy.

13:46.225 --> 13:48.881
That's-- you... guys are right.

13:48.882 --> 13:50.807
This is outrageous!

13:52.543 --> 13:56.142
Hey, yo, Sully, any leads
on Charlie's mystery job?

13:56.143 --> 13:58.361
Nothing that explains that 125 grand.

13:58.362 --> 13:59.743
The only thing I've been
able to dig up so far

13:59.744 --> 14:01.361
are some personal
appearance trips to Russia

14:01.362 --> 14:03.148
over the last few years.
Russia?

14:03.149 --> 14:05.365
Oh, yeah. "2 Cool For
School" is huge over there.

14:05.366 --> 14:08.324
Dewey is to Russia what David
Hasselhoff is to Germany.

14:08.325 --> 14:10.318
Oh, I-I did catch a break
off his credit card.

14:10.319 --> 14:11.623
I got a line on a cab

14:11.624 --> 14:13.217
that picked Charlie up
the day he got killed.

14:13.218 --> 14:15.395
Where'd it take him?
His sublet. But here's the kicker.

14:15.396 --> 14:16.695
Another dude hopped in the backseat,

14:16.696 --> 14:18.124
and the two of them got in a huge fight.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.615
Did you get a description?
Uh, no. Better.

14:20.616 --> 14:23.249
I got a name. His former
co-star--Ramon Russo.

14:23.250 --> 14:24.924
Oh, yeah. He played the jock--Marco--right?

14:24.925 --> 14:26.049
Yeah. Oh.

14:26.050 --> 14:27.879
So... you have seen the show.

14:29.138 --> 14:30.629
Just caught it by accident once. It was...

14:30.630 --> 14:32.768
Oh. Well, then as you might know,

14:32.769 --> 14:35.205
not only did Ramon play Marco, but word is,

14:35.206 --> 14:36.273
they hated each other.

14:36.274 --> 14:38.098
Maybe that feud led to murder.

14:40.979 --> 14:42.228
It was an accident.

14:43.616 --> 14:45.965
I tried to walk away,
but he pushed me first.

14:47.533 --> 14:49.377
I didn't mean to kill him, I swear.

14:50.313 --> 14:51.568
Ramon Russo?

14:54.583 --> 14:56.429
My apologies, you guys.

14:56.753 --> 14:58.987
I'm telling you, this
happens to me all the time,

14:58.988 --> 15:00.718
whether I'm out there on the street,

15:00.719 --> 15:02.610
or here teaching class.

15:03.048 --> 15:04.646
So, how can I help you fellas?

15:04.647 --> 15:06.608
You want a... an autographed picture, what?

15:06.609 --> 15:08.415
How about some of your time?

15:08.771 --> 15:11.032
Maybe even decades of it.

15:11.132 --> 15:14.386
I'm telling you, Charlie's death
is a personal tragedy for me

15:14.387 --> 15:16.216
and a huge loss for the acting community,

15:16.217 --> 15:17.565
and I'll do anything I can to help you find

15:17.566 --> 15:19.090
whoever did this to him.

15:19.546 --> 15:21.943
We understand you shared a
cab ride with him yesterday.

15:21.944 --> 15:24.240
That's right. We... we left work together.

15:24.241 --> 15:26.072
Oh. You worked with him?

15:26.073 --> 15:29.124
On what? And did it involve chickens?

15:29.125 --> 15:32.495
Chickens? No! We were doing
"2 Cool For School."

15:32.496 --> 15:34.622
But that show's been off
the air for 20 years.

15:34.623 --> 15:37.201
No, man. We're doing a reunion movie.

15:37.202 --> 15:38.513
You are?
Yeah.

15:38.760 --> 15:40.705
I mean, this is just the
first we're hearing of it.

15:40.706 --> 15:42.457
It's on the down-low. You
know, we all had to sign

15:42.458 --> 15:44.882
those confidentiality agreements.
Right.

15:45.053 --> 15:46.407
But to be honest...

15:47.018 --> 15:49.038
I had a lot of other projects in the works.

15:49.039 --> 15:50.624
Charlie begged me to do it.

15:50.625 --> 15:51.769
He said, you know, it'd be fun

15:51.770 --> 15:53.475
to get the old gang back
together, you know?

15:53.476 --> 15:55.546
Even with all the bad
blood between you two?

15:55.891 --> 15:57.940
I mean, wasn't your character-- Marco--

15:57.941 --> 15:59.416
originally supposed to
be the star of the show?

15:59.417 --> 16:02.826
And then Dewey caught fire,
stole the spotlight.

16:02.827 --> 16:04.794
Stole your spotlight.

16:04.795 --> 16:05.673
We were kids back then.

16:05.674 --> 16:09.309
I mean, that show did a lot of
great things for all of us.

16:09.310 --> 16:10.824
Whatever issues we had,

16:10.825 --> 16:13.074
we buried the hatchet a long time ago.

16:13.075 --> 16:15.359
Not according to your cabbie.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.470
He said the two of you
got into a big fight.

16:17.471 --> 16:18.922
Yeah, I lost my temper

16:18.923 --> 16:20.824
because he was wasting my time.

16:20.829 --> 16:22.734
He was disrespecting the craft.

16:22.735 --> 16:24.765
Charlie didn't know any of the lines.

16:24.766 --> 16:27.039
I mean, I'm telling you,
he was never like that.

16:27.306 --> 16:28.710
He was--he was always real good

16:28.711 --> 16:30.426
with that kind of stuff, you know?

16:30.676 --> 16:31.661
You're saying there was something

16:31.662 --> 16:33.664
going on with Charlie.
Definitely.

16:33.665 --> 16:35.145
It started a couple days ago.

16:35.146 --> 16:37.565
He started showing up anxious and tired.

16:37.764 --> 16:40.177
And I asked him what was
wrong, but he wouldn't say.

16:42.294 --> 16:45.235
Where were you last night
between 11:30 and 1:30?

16:46.101 --> 16:48.459
So Ramon's girlfriend
Yasmine confirms the story.

16:48.460 --> 16:50.139
He was home all nights
running lines with her.

16:50.140 --> 16:53.590
Lines like, "I'm the biggest
deal to ever walk these halls."

16:53.591 --> 16:57.109
Ramon slipped me a signed
copy of the script--

16:57.110 --> 16:58.536
"Those who can't, teach."

16:58.537 --> 17:01.112
Really? Well--well, what's the storyline?

17:01.113 --> 17:03.769
Dewey and Marco are back at
Bayview High as faculty.

17:03.770 --> 17:05.714
Dewey is the brainy science teacher,

17:05.715 --> 17:08.970
while Marco is reliving his glory
days as the football coach.

17:08.971 --> 17:10.979
Oh, no. When Dewey runs into

17:10.980 --> 17:12.888
the sexy German teacher-- Mrs. Pozman--

17:12.890 --> 17:14.755
in the break room, he says...

17:14.756 --> 17:15.994
"Hubba, hubba."
"Hubba, hubba."

17:16.465 --> 17:17.790
"Hubba, hubba."

17:21.522 --> 17:24.987
Anyway, I, uh, talked to the
office staff at the movie set,

17:24.988 --> 17:26.925
and not only has Charlie
been acting weird lately,

17:26.925 --> 17:29.261
but two days ago, he
sweet-talked the accountant

17:29.262 --> 17:31.072
into letting him look over the books.

17:31.073 --> 17:33.047
Why would the star care about
the budget of the show?

17:33.048 --> 17:34.737
I don't know, but the accountant told me

17:34.738 --> 17:36.967
that Charlie said he'd
found irregularities.

17:36.968 --> 17:38.923
And get this. He made her swear

17:38.924 --> 17:40.870
not to tell the film's producer Hank Harper

17:40.871 --> 17:42.434
that he'd been poking around.

17:42.435 --> 17:44.143
Hank Harper? I've heard of him.

17:44.633 --> 17:46.826
Rumor was he chased a director off set

17:46.827 --> 17:48.411
with a baseball bat.

17:48.412 --> 17:51.412
Check this out. Though
he's never been convicted,

17:51.413 --> 17:54.546
Hank Harper has faced numerous
charges of embezzling money

17:54.547 --> 17:55.899
from the films that he's worked on.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.263
If Charlie would have found out that Hank

17:57.264 --> 17:58.854
was skimming money from the movie...

17:58.855 --> 18:00.841
Then maybe Hank gave Charlie the hook.

18:08.935 --> 18:10.435
According to the production office,

18:10.436 --> 18:12.824
Hank Harper's somewhere here on this set.

18:12.899 --> 18:15.193
What could they even be
filming if the star is dead?

18:15.194 --> 18:16.489
Probably the scenes without Dewey.

18:16.490 --> 18:18.707
Or scenes that explain why
he's not in the whole movie.

18:18.708 --> 18:20.154
Or he's back from the dead.

18:20.155 --> 18:22.530
The zombie apocalypse version.
Now that I would watch.

18:22.531 --> 18:23.793
No, look, right there.

18:26.236 --> 18:27.567
There's another one.

18:29.307 --> 18:30.877
They must be re-casting the part.

18:30.878 --> 18:33.141
What? There's only one Dewey Hancock.

18:33.142 --> 18:34.622
Yeah? Tell him that.

18:34.623 --> 18:35.839
Action!

18:36.029 --> 18:38.149
Dewey, thanks for giving up a Friday night

18:38.150 --> 18:40.252
to chaperone the dance with me.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.753
I'll see you there.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.026
Hubba, hubba.

18:43.027 --> 18:44.904
No, no, no!

18:44.905 --> 18:47.295
"Hubba, hubba" is not just a catchphrase,

18:47.296 --> 18:49.738
it is the essence of your character.

18:49.739 --> 18:52.805
"Hubba, hubba" comes from here, not here.

18:53.126 --> 18:57.069
And, Svetlana, make him work
for the "Hubba, hubba."

18:57.070 --> 18:58.168
No! No!

18:58.169 --> 19:00.001
Forget it. Please. Come on.
You tried this before.

19:00.002 --> 19:01.524
The answer's no.
Hank Harper.

19:01.773 --> 19:02.709
It's too late, pretty boy.

19:02.710 --> 19:05.044
We already cast the muscular P.E. teacher.

19:07.207 --> 19:08.780
N.Y.P.D.

19:08.953 --> 19:10.733
We're here about Charlie Reynolds.

19:11.151 --> 19:12.866
I'm gonna have to call you back.

19:13.672 --> 19:15.930
Charlie was a great kid, a real pro.

19:16.254 --> 19:19.273
Working with him reminded me of
the pictures I did with Pacino.

19:19.274 --> 19:21.128
You worked with Al Pacino?

19:21.413 --> 19:23.838
Barry Pacino. No relation.

19:23.839 --> 19:25.891
Every bit as talented, and taller.

19:25.892 --> 19:27.247
If you have such a high opinion of Charlie,

19:27.248 --> 19:28.632
how come you're already replacing him?

19:28.633 --> 19:29.602
Look, you gotta understand,

19:29.603 --> 19:31.031
there's a lot of money at stake here.

19:31.032 --> 19:32.826
The show must go on.

19:32.827 --> 19:34.607
Ah! I've been there.

19:34.608 --> 19:37.206
My book "Nikki Heat" got made
into a movie a few years back.

19:37.207 --> 19:38.669
Didn't that go straight to DVD?

19:38.670 --> 19:40.346
There were script issues.

19:41.130 --> 19:43.400
And... casting issues and directing issues.

19:43.401 --> 19:45.580
Did Charlie have any
problems with anyone on set?

19:45.780 --> 19:47.213
Not that I'm aware of.

19:47.214 --> 19:50.118
Everybody loved him. What's not to love?

19:50.119 --> 19:52.236
He took a look at the
accounting books recently.

19:52.237 --> 19:53.276
Any idea why?

19:53.277 --> 19:54.601
Can't imagine. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:54.602 --> 19:56.426
Easy.
Well, we might.

19:56.427 --> 19:59.319
Maybe Charlie thought
somebody was skimming money.

19:59.320 --> 20:03.603
Yes, we heard about your penchant
for creative bookkeeping.

20:03.604 --> 20:06.644
Wait. You think I killed him?

20:07.159 --> 20:10.009
Well, if Charlie found out that
you were up to your old tricks,

20:10.122 --> 20:11.222
it would be motive.

20:11.223 --> 20:14.161
First of all, I was here all
night doing script changes.

20:14.162 --> 20:16.586
Plus I may have been caught
with my hand in the cookie jar

20:16.587 --> 20:18.181
in the past, but I'm not stupid enough

20:18.182 --> 20:19.988
to steal from the Russians.

20:20.398 --> 20:21.367
The Russians?

20:21.368 --> 20:22.606
Yeah, they're financing this picture.

20:22.607 --> 20:24.315
They want to make this into a franchise.

20:24.316 --> 20:26.021
This is my meal ticket!

20:26.022 --> 20:27.416
So if there's anything
hinky with the books,

20:27.417 --> 20:28.709
it's not 'cause of me.

20:29.278 --> 20:30.872
Yeah, well, we're not gonna
take your word for that.

20:30.873 --> 20:32.377
We're gonna need to see those books.

20:32.378 --> 20:33.748
Oh, oh, yeah.

20:34.743 --> 20:35.849
They're all yours.

20:35.850 --> 20:37.002
Thanks.

20:37.263 --> 20:38.960
We're gonna need one of these hats, too.

20:40.445 --> 20:41.555
You know what I don't get?

20:41.556 --> 20:43.649
You're wearing that hat.
There's a lot you don't get.

20:43.650 --> 20:45.285
Let's say Hank did embezzle money

20:45.286 --> 20:46.538
and killed Charlie to silence him.

20:46.539 --> 20:47.990
Why are the feds involved?

20:47.991 --> 20:49.910
Maybe it has something
to do with the Russians.

20:49.911 --> 20:51.322
Well, if we knew the feds' angle,

20:51.323 --> 20:53.025
we'd have a leg up on solving this.

20:53.026 --> 20:54.689
Sorry, guys, I have yet to come up with

20:54.690 --> 20:58.222
a crazy genius... theory yet.

20:58.594 --> 20:59.917
You don't need to,

21:00.037 --> 21:02.214
not when you can go directly to the source.

21:02.215 --> 21:03.955
Get Beckett to give us the lowdown.

21:03.956 --> 21:05.346
Okay, wait a minute--

21:05.347 --> 21:07.033
We get much-needed case information,

21:07.034 --> 21:09.791
you get to clear up any lingering
doubts about your loyalty.

21:09.792 --> 21:10.602
Everybody wins.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.711
Okay, guys, no, I can't do that, all right?

21:12.712 --> 21:14.853
After D.C., we promised we wouldn't--

21:15.402 --> 21:17.776
We did you a solid getting
you on this case, Castle.

21:18.006 --> 21:19.568
It's time to pay up.

21:20.646 --> 21:21.806
Guys...

21:24.216 --> 21:26.139
Okay? What does it say about our future

21:26.140 --> 21:28.469
if I keep pushing the boundaries?

21:28.470 --> 21:31.153
Castle, your whole relationship is built

21:31.154 --> 21:33.139
on a foundation of your boundary pushing.

21:35.693 --> 21:36.887
Good point.

21:45.332 --> 21:46.590
I got your text.
Hey.

21:46.591 --> 21:47.799
I just wanted to check in with you.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.212
You know, it must be weird for you

21:49.213 --> 21:50.734
being back here at the precinct,

21:50.735 --> 21:53.222
working a case.
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

21:53.892 --> 21:56.145
Yeah. Especially since
McCord's little gag order

21:56.146 --> 21:57.809
prevents you from accessing

21:57.810 --> 22:00.400
your most effective investigative tool...

22:00.583 --> 22:01.692
me.

22:02.036 --> 22:04.310
Yeah, you are a tool, all right?

22:05.413 --> 22:07.153
Wow. So, uh...

22:07.192 --> 22:08.325
she's not here right now,

22:08.326 --> 22:11.363
so what's the harm in
giving me a little tidbit?

22:16.057 --> 22:17.511
This is a bribe.

22:17.512 --> 22:20.553
Castle, you're bribing me with a latte?

22:20.554 --> 22:22.142
No, I am not.

22:22.143 --> 22:23.607
Come on. Don't be ridiculous.

22:23.608 --> 22:25.586
This is low, even for you.

22:25.587 --> 22:26.894
Look, I can solve this.

22:26.895 --> 22:28.803
I just need a little more to go on.

22:28.804 --> 22:29.943
Castle...

22:30.101 --> 22:31.938
you're not gonna Castle me on this one.

22:31.939 --> 22:32.910
Okay, she's coming.

22:32.911 --> 22:34.529
Just nod once if it's about the Russians,

22:34.530 --> 22:36.389
twice if it's about something else.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.260
Twice. About something else.

22:40.091 --> 22:41.601
Three times. What's--

22:41.666 --> 22:42.793
what does th-- what does that mean?

22:42.794 --> 22:44.550
What--how come-- I don't
know what that means.

22:44.551 --> 22:45.490
Beckett.
Hmm?

22:45.491 --> 22:47.142
We got a lead. Let's go.

22:48.271 --> 22:49.531
See you, Castle.

22:49.532 --> 22:52.390
What does th-- what does three nods mean?

22:56.957 --> 22:57.820
Well?

22:58.597 --> 23:00.042
I tried, but...

23:00.202 --> 23:01.770
she won't talk to me about the case.

23:01.771 --> 23:02.946
Well, where did the two
of them go just now?

23:02.947 --> 23:04.611
Yeah, she wouldn't tell me that, either.

23:04.686 --> 23:05.631
Hey, I was just--

23:05.632 --> 23:07.748
I can't even look at you right now.

23:07.749 --> 23:09.317
Hey, guys, I think we found something

23:09.318 --> 23:11.062
in these books Charlie was looking into.

23:11.206 --> 23:12.741
I went over them, and there's no signs

23:12.742 --> 23:14.222
of any financial shenanigans.

23:14.223 --> 23:17.205
The balance sheet seems kosher, but, um,

23:17.206 --> 23:19.271
check out this ledger entry.

23:19.438 --> 23:21.937
That is the number we found
in Charlie's pocket.

23:21.938 --> 23:24.459
This must be that irregularity
that Charlie was talking about.

23:24.460 --> 23:25.438
But what does it mean?

23:25.439 --> 23:27.084
Well, it corresponds to an invoice number

23:27.085 --> 23:29.190
for a shipment of camera
equipment for the movie

23:29.191 --> 23:30.420
sent over from Russia.

23:30.421 --> 23:31.733
What makes that an irregularity?

23:31.734 --> 23:33.127
Well, for one thing, it'd be a lot cheaper

23:33.128 --> 23:34.282
just to rent cameras here.

23:34.283 --> 23:35.204
Not only that,

23:35.205 --> 23:37.131
but the shipment was sent to
a warehouse in Brooklyn...

23:37.132 --> 23:39.772
which happens to be right next
to a chicken processing plant.

23:39.773 --> 23:42.398
Which explains the poop on Charlie's shoes.

23:42.399 --> 23:44.706
Charlie went to that warehouse
right before he was killed.

23:44.707 --> 23:46.771
Maybe whoever killed him came from there.

23:51.434 --> 23:52.456
Looks deserted.

23:52.457 --> 23:54.205
Yeah, that doesn't mean that it is.

23:54.335 --> 23:57.542
This place could be teeming
with bloodthirsty cossacks.

23:57.643 --> 23:59.913
Do you have an extra gun?
Not for you.

24:03.777 --> 24:04.902
At least we know we're in the right place.

24:04.903 --> 24:06.837
I definitely stepped in something.

24:16.511 --> 24:18.064
Hey, guys, I found it.

24:18.065 --> 24:20.135
I found the shipment. Same invoice number.

24:27.038 --> 24:28.770
It is just camera gear.

24:29.115 --> 24:31.992
Wait a minute. It's a false bottom.

24:31.993 --> 24:32.868
All right.

24:35.081 --> 24:36.192
Oh!

24:37.887 --> 24:41.038
My mother always said that
the film business was tough.

24:41.039 --> 24:43.446
That's why the Russians are
financing that dumbass movie.

24:43.447 --> 24:45.640
They're using the production
to smuggle in illegal weapons.

24:45.641 --> 24:47.378
It's like "Argo," but with guns.

24:47.379 --> 24:49.912
Put the gun down and show me your hands!

24:49.913 --> 24:51.611
Now turn around slowly.

24:55.804 --> 24:57.974
What the hell are you guys doing here?

24:57.975 --> 25:00.598
We're finding the guns you're looking for.

25:00.927 --> 25:02.546
What guns?

25:02.681 --> 25:04.346
You didn't know about the guns?

25:05.779 --> 25:08.437
We came here to observe and report.

25:08.438 --> 25:11.202
We don't know any more about
this case than you do.

25:11.203 --> 25:12.861
Well, then how did you guys get here?

25:12.862 --> 25:14.764
By retracing our victim's movements.

25:14.765 --> 25:16.678
He came here the day he died.

25:16.711 --> 25:18.185
He must have come across these guns.

25:18.186 --> 25:20.843
I'll contact the A.T.F., have
them secure the weapons.

25:20.844 --> 25:23.277
Not so fast, Clarice.

25:23.278 --> 25:24.675
We're the ones who found 'em,

25:24.676 --> 25:27.384
so N.Y.P.D.'s gonna be the one
booking these into evidence.

25:27.385 --> 25:28.871
That's where you're both wrong!

25:29.965 --> 25:31.889
These guns aren't going anywhere.

25:39.586 --> 25:41.683
Put your weapon down now.

25:41.684 --> 25:43.846
You're the jogger. The
guy who found the body.

25:43.847 --> 25:47.085
Just put the gun down.
We're federal agents.

25:47.086 --> 25:48.710
I'm a federal agent, too.

25:48.711 --> 25:51.417
Name's Ethan Wright. I'm C.I.A.

25:51.418 --> 25:53.599
Have Mario Lopez here make the call.

25:53.865 --> 25:56.113
Assuming you are who you say you are,

25:56.114 --> 25:57.905
why would the C.I.A. be involved?

25:57.906 --> 25:59.802
Charlie Reynolds was working for us.

25:59.803 --> 26:01.493
I recruited him two years ago.

26:01.494 --> 26:02.843
Dewey was a spy?

26:02.844 --> 26:05.473
We used him to infiltrate
the family of Anton Renkov.

26:05.474 --> 26:07.616
Anton Renkov? I know that name.

26:07.617 --> 26:10.319
He's the most notorious
gangster in all Russia.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.791
He's also a major fan
of "2 Cool For School."

26:12.792 --> 26:15.051
That's why Charlie was taking
all those trips to Russia.

26:15.052 --> 26:16.596
That's right. They love him there,

26:16.597 --> 26:18.418
so I approached him about using those trips

26:18.419 --> 26:21.024
to gather intel on Renkov
and his organization.

26:21.025 --> 26:23.428
Charlie didn't hesitate. He was good.

26:23.429 --> 26:24.735
Turned out he was a better actor

26:24.736 --> 26:25.799
than most people gave him credit for.

26:25.800 --> 26:26.960
That's what I've been saying.

26:26.981 --> 26:29.726
Yo. This guy checks out.

26:29.727 --> 26:30.783
Thank God. My arm.

26:30.784 --> 26:33.602
So Anton Renkov was using the movie

26:33.603 --> 26:36.057
as a front to smuggle arms into the U.S.

26:36.058 --> 26:37.247
For the Russian mob,

26:37.248 --> 26:39.737
and Charlie's job was to find those guns.

26:39.738 --> 26:40.960
More or less.

26:41.299 --> 26:43.188
He contacted me a couple of days ago.

26:43.189 --> 26:45.104
He told me that he'd located the shipment.

26:45.813 --> 26:47.967
We set up a meet so we could
get him a G.P.S. tracker

26:47.968 --> 26:49.246
to attach to the guns.

26:49.247 --> 26:51.934
When he didn't call, I
started looking for him.

26:51.935 --> 26:53.549
Would have been nice if you told us sooner.

26:53.550 --> 26:55.635
What can I say? It was need-to-know.

26:55.720 --> 26:57.633
We needed you to monitor the investigation

26:57.634 --> 26:59.869
so N.Y.P.D. didn't get too
close to the Russians

26:59.870 --> 27:01.497
to compromise our operation.

27:01.498 --> 27:03.491
We also figured you might
lead us to the weapons,

27:03.492 --> 27:04.471
which you did.

27:04.472 --> 27:06.301
So... what happens now?

27:06.302 --> 27:07.957
We hope that Renkov sends the guns on

27:07.958 --> 27:09.290
to wherever they're going...

27:10.288 --> 27:11.993
so we can track them.

27:12.404 --> 27:14.082
And you guys walk away.

27:15.129 --> 27:16.407
I can't believe Charlie was spying

27:16.408 --> 27:18.681
on Anton Renkov and his organization.

27:18.682 --> 27:20.726
Any of them look familiar?
Yeah.

27:20.727 --> 27:23.180
I saw about three of those
Russians on the movie set.

27:23.181 --> 27:24.452
Mm-hmm. And according to interpol,

27:24.453 --> 27:26.716
all of them got criminal records
back in the motherland--

27:26.717 --> 27:28.872
assault, murder, all kinds of bad stuff.

27:28.873 --> 27:30.797
I bet one of them found out
that Charlie was a spy,

27:30.798 --> 27:31.765
and they killed him.

27:31.766 --> 27:33.217
Especially since we know that Charlie

27:33.218 --> 27:34.969
was followed to the warehouse.

27:35.799 --> 27:37.010
Based on what?

27:37.620 --> 27:39.587
We tracked Charlie's movements

27:39.588 --> 27:42.089
by triangulating the cell towers
that his phone pinged off,

27:42.090 --> 27:43.932
and then we used that time stamp

27:43.933 --> 27:46.507
to pull satellite footage of the warehouse.

27:47.496 --> 27:48.897
How'd you guys get there?

27:48.963 --> 27:50.213
Chicken poop.

27:50.742 --> 27:51.571
Oh.

27:51.994 --> 27:53.761
Well, whatever works.

27:53.762 --> 27:55.802
Point is, someone was following him.

27:55.803 --> 27:57.091
That's what I'd investigate.

27:57.092 --> 27:59.630
Actually, we need to hit
pause on the investigation.

27:59.631 --> 28:01.023
Word just came down from D.C.

28:01.024 --> 28:01.781
Why?

28:01.782 --> 28:04.573
C.I.A. doesn't believe Renkov
knows Charlie was a mole.

28:04.574 --> 28:05.950
They think the Russians would
have moved the weapons

28:05.951 --> 28:06.640
if they knew.

28:06.641 --> 28:08.461
Well, we're not interested in the weapons.

28:08.462 --> 28:09.594
We just want to solve his murder.

28:09.595 --> 28:11.208
And D.C. has a problem with that.

28:11.209 --> 28:13.437
You talk to these Russians,
it could kick up some dust,

28:13.677 --> 28:15.478
set off their alarms about Charlie Reynolds

28:15.479 --> 28:17.305
and jeopardize the C.I.A. operation.

28:17.572 --> 28:21.062
Okay. So by "pause," what
you really mean is "stop."

28:21.946 --> 28:23.295
I know how you feel,

28:23.296 --> 28:27.492
but this case intersects with
national security issues.

28:27.493 --> 28:29.182
I'm sorry, but it's over.

28:43.696 --> 28:44.541
Hey.

28:45.305 --> 28:47.207
Got your text. What time's your flight?

28:47.208 --> 28:48.477
Tomorrow morning.

28:49.077 --> 28:49.674
So listen.

28:49.675 --> 28:52.840
I'm, uh, sorry about
that whole bribe thing.

28:52.841 --> 28:54.740
I should have known you were incorruptible.

28:54.741 --> 28:56.271
Yeah, I wouldn't say that.

28:56.354 --> 28:57.239
Hmm.

28:57.613 --> 29:01.359
Well, then allow me to try and corrupt you

29:01.788 --> 29:03.451
a little later at my place,

29:03.639 --> 29:07.151
where we can finally have some alone time.

29:07.509 --> 29:10.315
And by "alone time," I
mean you and me and...

29:10.535 --> 29:15.017
My mother and Alexis and... Pi.

29:15.921 --> 29:16.916
That...

29:17.476 --> 29:19.952
that sounds... crowded.

29:19.953 --> 29:21.177
Yeah.

29:21.626 --> 29:23.524
You know what? Why don't
you just give me a call

29:23.525 --> 29:24.978
after you guys have solved the case?

29:24.979 --> 29:27.401
Didn't you hear McCord?
The case is wrapped.

29:30.635 --> 29:31.748
Is it?

29:39.474 --> 29:41.581
This whole "greater good" thing blows.

29:41.742 --> 29:43.229
Charlie died serving his country.

29:43.230 --> 29:44.402
He deserves justice.

29:44.403 --> 29:46.714
What happened to Beckett? She
used to understand that.

29:46.715 --> 29:48.404
I think she still does.

30:01.575 --> 30:02.713
This must be the satellite footage

30:02.714 --> 30:04.137
Beckett was talking about.

30:04.527 --> 30:06.658
And there's Charlie entering the warehouse.

30:08.751 --> 30:10.027
Uh, gentlemen?

30:10.679 --> 30:13.577
I take it you're finishing
up paperwork on the case

30:13.578 --> 30:16.105
that you are no longer investigating?

30:16.513 --> 30:17.693
You bet.
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

30:17.694 --> 30:20.362
Good. Carry on.

30:23.353 --> 30:25.774
Okay.
You see him?

30:25.779 --> 30:28.084
Beckett was right. Charlie was followed.

30:28.210 --> 30:30.838
And look, he's wearing a
baseball cap to be incognito.

30:31.314 --> 30:34.686
Not incognito enough. Check
out the design on that hat.

30:34.863 --> 30:37.151
Just like the...

30:37.307 --> 30:39.747
"2 Cool For School" crew hat that I got.

30:39.748 --> 30:40.732
The one you made fun of.

30:40.733 --> 30:43.664
So whoever followed Charlie
came from the movie set.

30:46.457 --> 30:47.442
Thanks for your time.

30:47.851 --> 30:49.713
Guys, nobody at the production office

30:49.714 --> 30:51.252
saw Charlie being followed.

30:51.253 --> 30:53.073
But soon as he was done
filming for the day,

30:53.074 --> 30:55.665
a P.A. gave him a ride
to a bodega in Brooklyn.

30:55.666 --> 30:58.174
That bodega-- five blocks
from the warehouse.

30:58.175 --> 31:00.905
This is the security cam footage
from outside the bodega.

31:00.906 --> 31:01.960
And based on the time stamp,

31:01.961 --> 31:03.966
this is when the P.A. dropped Charlie off.

31:05.277 --> 31:07.147
That's him. There he is.

31:08.135 --> 31:09.500
Okay...

31:10.306 --> 31:11.764
And...

31:11.841 --> 31:13.682
There's our guy in the crew hat.

31:13.683 --> 31:15.278
I can't quite make out his face.

31:16.079 --> 31:17.328
Try a different angle.

31:19.510 --> 31:21.279
Ah, I'm gonna try zooming in.

31:23.724 --> 31:25.551
That's the actress from the movie.

31:25.552 --> 31:28.298
Wait a minute. She's not just an actress.

31:28.909 --> 31:31.613
She's also Svetlana Renkov.

31:31.614 --> 31:33.134
She's Anton's niece.

31:33.135 --> 31:34.467
Hubba, hubba.

31:36.289 --> 31:38.316
So basically your people did exactly

31:38.317 --> 31:39.855
what I told them not to do?

31:39.856 --> 31:42.043
You put us in a difficult
spot when you decided

31:42.044 --> 31:44.129
that the C.I.A.'s agenda was more important

31:44.130 --> 31:45.090
than solving a murder?

31:45.091 --> 31:47.935
I didn't decide anything. Orders came down.

31:47.936 --> 31:49.877
This is not my first rodeo

31:49.878 --> 31:51.789
dealing with the folks down in D.C.

31:51.790 --> 31:52.529
Soon enough,

31:52.530 --> 31:55.735
the name "Charlie Reynolds" will
be a distant memory for you.

31:55.736 --> 31:56.877
But not for us.

31:56.878 --> 31:59.015
He may not have had a grieving mother

31:59.016 --> 32:01.116
or a wife waiting for him,

32:01.117 --> 32:04.539
but his killer should not go unpunished.

32:04.643 --> 32:05.853
Regardless,

32:06.949 --> 32:09.679
I can't let you take a
run at Svetlana Renkov.

32:10.486 --> 32:11.565
Look, the whole reason

32:11.566 --> 32:13.733
the C.I.A. is shutting this case down

32:13.734 --> 32:16.135
is because they are
convinced that the Russians

32:16.136 --> 32:18.686
didn't realize that Charlie was a spy.

32:18.687 --> 32:20.671
But Anton's niece following Charlie

32:20.672 --> 32:22.212
seems to contradict that.

32:22.213 --> 32:24.529
And if the Russians did get on to Charlie,

32:24.530 --> 32:25.716
wouldn't the C.I.A. want to know

32:25.717 --> 32:27.692
that their mission is compromised?

32:28.195 --> 32:29.318
Okay.

32:29.562 --> 32:32.657
In the spirit of containment...

32:35.432 --> 32:37.078
let's talk to Svetlana.

32:39.079 --> 32:40.193
You followed him.

32:40.477 --> 32:42.344
You followed him to the warehouse.

32:42.966 --> 32:43.901
Yes.

32:43.902 --> 32:45.224
Why did he go there?

32:48.328 --> 32:50.349
He was looking for guns.

32:51.007 --> 32:53.211
And that was when you realized...

32:53.212 --> 32:54.785
he was about to betray your family,

32:54.786 --> 32:56.482
and so you told them.

32:56.483 --> 32:57.798
I told no one.

32:57.799 --> 32:59.524
You didn't even tell your Uncle Anton

32:59.525 --> 33:01.574
or your other relatives?
No.

33:01.575 --> 33:03.461
I knew Charlie was a spy,

33:03.462 --> 33:05.329
but I never said so to my family.

33:05.330 --> 33:06.992
I would die first.

33:07.470 --> 33:09.072
We were in love.

33:10.435 --> 33:11.829
I'm sorry. What?

33:13.184 --> 33:15.274
I can show you our love letters.

33:16.691 --> 33:19.999
You mock Dewey, but not
only was he a secret agent,

33:20.000 --> 33:21.022
look at that.

33:21.198 --> 33:22.375
He was a stud.

33:22.376 --> 33:25.413
It's Romeo and Juliet...
with a nerdy Romeo.

33:25.414 --> 33:27.630
And a smokin'-hot Russian Juliet.

33:27.946 --> 33:30.378
We fell in love the moment we met.

33:30.379 --> 33:31.987
For two years, I only saw Charlie

33:31.988 --> 33:34.582
when he came to Anton's parties in Russia.

33:34.604 --> 33:37.074
He knew I wanted to get away--

33:37.206 --> 33:38.891
away from that life.

33:38.892 --> 33:40.367
So when Anton paid for the movie,

33:40.368 --> 33:42.484
Charlie said it was a-a perfect chance

33:42.485 --> 33:45.756
for me to come here, for us to be together.

33:45.940 --> 33:47.058
Okay, if all of that's true,

33:47.059 --> 33:49.367
then why did you trail
him to the warehouse?

33:49.368 --> 33:52.025
To beg him not to look for those guns.

33:52.049 --> 33:54.628
I was afraid my family would find out.

33:55.456 --> 33:56.267
And did they?

33:56.268 --> 33:58.868
No. If they knew, I would be dead, too.

33:58.869 --> 34:01.720
I told him to stop, but Charlie
wouldn't listen to me.

34:01.721 --> 34:04.617
He said he had to finish
this one last mission

34:04.618 --> 34:06.193
before we disappeared.

34:06.544 --> 34:08.141
What do you mean, disappeared?

34:08.143 --> 34:10.888
We were going to run away and start over.

34:10.889 --> 34:12.860
We were supposed to leave today,

34:12.893 --> 34:15.966
get away from my family, get a fresh start.

34:16.408 --> 34:18.907
Charlie wanted to leave everything behind--

34:19.283 --> 34:21.458
the spying, the acting,

34:21.458 --> 34:22.902
the stupid character of Dewey.

34:22.902 --> 34:25.179
What about his apartment? He
just spent a lot of money

34:25.181 --> 34:26.482
renovating it.

34:26.896 --> 34:28.701
He was leaving that, too.

34:30.467 --> 34:31.737
I mean, he could have gone to the roof

34:31.737 --> 34:34.641
for one last look at the
place, say good-bye.

34:34.643 --> 34:37.440
He didn't have to. He knew
it was in good hands.

34:37.440 --> 34:39.053
He was giving it to a friend.

34:39.054 --> 34:41.074
That's why he was there that night.

34:41.982 --> 34:43.301
Who's the friend?

34:48.040 --> 34:49.406
I can't believe it.

34:50.655 --> 34:52.590
It's not who I would have expected.

34:53.712 --> 34:54.893
_

34:55.172 --> 34:57.406
He was hiding in plain
sight this whole time.

35:03.216 --> 35:04.072
Ramon.

35:06.652 --> 35:07.781
You're under arrest.

35:16.939 --> 35:18.900
Now, Ramon, you told us

35:18.901 --> 35:21.819
that you had other projects in the works,

35:21.898 --> 35:24.801
that you did the reunion
move as a favor to Charlie.

35:24.802 --> 35:26.120
For old times' sake.

35:26.166 --> 35:27.622
That's what friends are for.

35:27.623 --> 35:29.233
That doesn't make me a killer.

35:29.350 --> 35:31.541
Yeah. Well, we looked into these, um,

35:31.542 --> 35:34.835
other projects, and, well,
this is what we found.

35:34.836 --> 35:35.917
You've been working the graveyard

35:35.918 --> 35:38.193
at global east security for four years.

35:38.194 --> 35:39.085
Yeah.

35:39.710 --> 35:41.719
Well, you know, acting has its, uh,

35:41.720 --> 35:43.314
ups and downs, you know?

35:43.315 --> 35:45.269
I knew I'd get back in
the game soon enough.

35:45.270 --> 35:47.838
Yeah. Especially if playing
the football coach

35:47.839 --> 35:49.011
on "2 Cool For School"

35:49.012 --> 35:50.411
turned out to be a recurring gig.

35:50.412 --> 35:53.312
Plan was to make sequels,
but if Charlie bailed,

35:53.313 --> 35:54.821
there wouldn't be any.
Yeah.

35:54.822 --> 35:56.776
You'd be back to working security.

35:57.533 --> 36:00.478
I didn't hurt Charlie. I have an alibi.

36:00.479 --> 36:02.858
Well, yeah... not anymore.

36:03.009 --> 36:04.477
See, your girlfriend admitted to us

36:04.478 --> 36:06.005
that she lied for you.

36:06.006 --> 36:06.989
She also mentioned that

36:06.990 --> 36:08.484
you borrowed her credit card that night.

36:08.485 --> 36:11.654
Yeah, it turns out that you
used it to charge a cab ride...

36:11.910 --> 36:13.240
to Charlie's building.

36:13.348 --> 36:14.789
You never told us that
Charlie was gonna let you

36:14.790 --> 36:17.599
stay at his apartment, because you knew

36:17.600 --> 36:19.661
it connected you to the crime scene.

36:21.689 --> 36:24.231
I can explain, okay? I can
explain everything, all right?

36:24.232 --> 36:26.045
It's over, Ramon.
No, no, no, no, no. Look.

36:26.046 --> 36:28.633
He was doing a scene, and after
that, he told me he was leaving.

36:28.707 --> 36:29.996
And I don't mean just for the day.

36:29.997 --> 36:31.554
He was leaving for good.

36:31.714 --> 36:33.120
He wanted a fresh start.

36:33.121 --> 36:35.450
He had been out of work as long as me.

36:36.220 --> 36:38.380
And now we had a shot
at doing these movies.

36:38.985 --> 36:40.676
You don't walk away from
that kind of opportunity,

36:40.677 --> 36:41.832
that kind of money!

36:43.258 --> 36:44.445
How did you end up on the roof?

36:44.446 --> 36:46.006
'Cause he asked me to meet him there!

36:46.329 --> 36:48.795
So I thought maybe he'd
changed his mind, so I went.

36:51.386 --> 36:53.410
So there we were, looking
at the great view.

36:54.736 --> 36:57.515
And he's saying to me that I can
stay at his place for free.

36:59.046 --> 37:00.903
I don't want no charity!

37:01.282 --> 37:03.281
I don't want to be house-sitting.

37:03.282 --> 37:05.666
I wanted my career back, and he ruined it!

37:05.667 --> 37:06.986
So you just snapped.

37:06.987 --> 37:08.516
You know, when I was on the show,

37:08.517 --> 37:11.727
I had money--for girls,
for cars, for clothes,

37:11.728 --> 37:13.884
for whatever, and then, bam, all it's gone.

37:16.938 --> 37:19.591
And nobody tells you how it
feels when it's gone, you know?

37:22.065 --> 37:24.488
Plenty of people around you
to help you spend it, though.

37:32.781 --> 37:34.981
I just wanted my old life back.

37:43.885 --> 37:45.401
We're getting a full confession,

37:45.402 --> 37:47.094
thanks to you, in large part.

37:50.369 --> 37:52.600
Don't be a stranger, Agent Beckett.

37:52.738 --> 37:54.214
Drop by and see us sometime.

37:54.215 --> 37:55.428
Thank you, sir. I will.

38:00.642 --> 38:02.314
Why is Svetlana still here?

38:04.018 --> 38:06.221
The C.I.A. asked us to hold her.

38:08.687 --> 38:11.017
Svetlana, this is your opportunity

38:11.018 --> 38:13.097
to honor Charlie's memory,

38:13.685 --> 38:15.078
to carry on his work.

38:15.079 --> 38:17.571
You are asking me to spy on my family?

38:18.170 --> 38:20.090
You have unprecedented access

38:20.091 --> 38:22.021
to Anton Renkov and his organization.

38:22.022 --> 38:24.181
That is extremely valuable to us.

38:24.182 --> 38:25.872
Do you know what they will do to me

38:25.873 --> 38:27.504
when they learn of this?

38:28.602 --> 38:30.632
They could learn of this right now.

38:31.389 --> 38:33.615
If word somehow got out
that Charlie was C.I.A.,

38:33.616 --> 38:36.107
your family would ask some
pretty tough questions.

38:36.161 --> 38:37.786
You would do this to me?

38:38.541 --> 38:39.846
Not if you help us.

38:43.222 --> 38:44.325
He's bluffing.

38:44.837 --> 38:47.137
C.I.A.'s not gonna just
expose her like that.

38:47.138 --> 38:50.003
Yeah, well, I wouldn't bet on it.

38:51.101 --> 38:52.666
The man that she loved was murdered,

38:52.667 --> 38:54.597
and he's gonna send her
on a suicide mission?

38:54.598 --> 38:55.898
Like I said,

38:56.668 --> 38:58.698
we don't always see the whole picture.

39:03.340 --> 39:05.116
I think this one's pretty clear.

39:08.066 --> 39:09.594
Yeah, looks good. You know?

39:10.078 --> 39:11.869
Hey, yo, Sully, nostalgia file.

39:12.658 --> 39:13.480
Hey. Thanks, Ryan.

39:13.481 --> 39:14.978
I'm off.
Hey.

39:14.979 --> 39:16.614
I just thought I'd say bye.
Good to see you.

39:16.615 --> 39:17.377
Yeah.

39:18.963 --> 39:20.273
You think McCord is gonna miss us?

39:20.274 --> 39:21.115
Oh, yeah, desperately,

39:21.116 --> 39:23.586
but I'll be there to pick up the pieces.

39:23.587 --> 39:25.651
Is that C.I.A. spook
really forcing Svetlana

39:25.652 --> 39:27.002
to take Charlie's place?
That's not right.

39:27.003 --> 39:28.879
Yeah, but, you know, there's not
much that we can do about it,

39:28.880 --> 39:29.936
but, I mean, what...

39:31.499 --> 39:33.709
I'm gonna clean that up, I swear.

39:33.948 --> 39:35.266
No. No.

39:36.993 --> 39:38.292
This is your desk now.

39:38.860 --> 39:39.600
And, uh...

39:40.404 --> 39:41.947
from what I can tell, you earned it.

39:42.621 --> 39:44.635
Well, thanks. That means
a lot coming from you.

39:44.636 --> 39:46.274
Police have arrested...
Check this out.

39:46.275 --> 39:48.292
Former "2 Cool For School" star Ramon Russo

39:48.293 --> 39:49.904
for the murder of Charlie Reynolds.

39:49.905 --> 39:52.433
Sources close to the
case say Russo's motive

39:52.434 --> 39:54.348
may be tied to Reynolds' relationship

39:54.349 --> 39:56.670
with co-star Svetlana Renkov,

39:56.671 --> 39:58.360
who is currently under investigation

39:58.361 --> 40:01.326
for her alleged ties to
Russian organized crime.

40:01.327 --> 40:02.778
Whoa. Whoa. Where'd they get that?

40:02.779 --> 40:04.756
Svetlana's not under investigation.

40:05.412 --> 40:07.209
Maybe someone fed them a bad tip.

40:08.653 --> 40:10.109
You know, once that news hits her family,

40:10.110 --> 40:11.531
they're gonna cut ties with her.

40:11.988 --> 40:14.009
She'll be no good to the C.I.A., huh?

40:14.718 --> 40:15.824
Too bad.

40:20.698 --> 40:22.645
Playing the anonymous source card?

40:22.646 --> 40:24.807
I mean, that is pure genius. It...

40:25.471 --> 40:27.140
it actually makes me love you more.

40:27.141 --> 40:28.340
Well, she's filing for asylum,

40:28.341 --> 40:30.030
and the state department is gonna help

40:30.031 --> 40:31.699
relocate her, so...

40:32.239 --> 40:33.676
hopefully that'll keep her safe.

40:33.677 --> 40:36.276
Yeah, but even working for the feds, you--

40:36.459 --> 40:38.535
you found the ultimate
way to honor the victim.

40:38.536 --> 40:41.841
Charlie died trying to get Svetlana away

40:41.842 --> 40:42.778
from her dangerous family.

40:42.779 --> 40:44.474
You completed his mission.

40:44.475 --> 40:46.093
Yeah, but you would have
done the same thing, Castle.

40:46.094 --> 40:49.698
Yes. Yes, and I would love
me more for doing it, too.

40:55.490 --> 40:56.331
Hey.

40:58.884 --> 40:59.651
Listen.

41:02.258 --> 41:04.057
We really have to talk about something.

41:04.204 --> 41:05.029
Okay.

41:06.877 --> 41:09.550
We've been doing this long-distance thing

41:09.551 --> 41:11.234
for months, and, uh...

41:12.463 --> 41:14.773
I mean, we never see each other,

41:14.774 --> 41:17.885
and when we do, it's a-- it's a day here,

41:17.886 --> 41:20.047
it's a-a weekend there, and...

41:21.924 --> 41:25.025
let's face it, I-it's not... working.

41:27.806 --> 41:29.719
I... I know, Castle,

41:29.720 --> 41:33.691
but I don't-- I don't
know how to f-fix this.

41:33.692 --> 41:34.774
I do.

41:39.666 --> 41:40.994
What is that?

41:41.016 --> 41:42.099
Well, it's a key...

41:42.807 --> 41:45.646
to our D.C. apartment.

41:47.081 --> 41:48.909
I mean, the truth is, I can--

41:48.918 --> 41:50.911
I can write from anywhere,
so I found a place

41:50.912 --> 41:53.437
with a little home office.

41:56.523 --> 41:58.387
Listen, if you don't like it
when you see it, we can--

41:58.388 --> 42:01.095
No. I don't need to see it. I love this.

42:07.526 --> 42:08.490
Hold that thought.
Okay.

42:08.491 --> 42:10.705
I bought mother, Alexis, and Pi

42:10.706 --> 42:11.880
a overnight yoga retreat.

42:11.881 --> 42:13.648
They should not be home early.

42:15.095 --> 42:16.970
Oh.
Hey.

42:16.984 --> 42:19.306
Hey. I thought our flight
was at 8:00 in the morning.

42:19.329 --> 42:20.354
It is.

42:21.838 --> 42:23.718
They know it was you that
tipped off the press.

42:24.880 --> 42:28.133
A part of me really admires you
for the choice that you made,

42:28.134 --> 42:29.950
maybe because I'd like to
think there was a time

42:29.951 --> 42:31.248
that I would have done it.

42:31.487 --> 42:33.641
But the people we answer
to don't feel that way.

42:33.642 --> 42:34.669
Rachel, I-I--

42:34.670 --> 42:38.349
Kate, you're one of the best
agents I've ever worked with.

42:39.817 --> 42:41.896
But I'm here to tell you you're fired.
